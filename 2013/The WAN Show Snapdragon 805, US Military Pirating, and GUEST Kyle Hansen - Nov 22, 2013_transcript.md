[0.00 --> 7.00]  Welcome to the WAN Show, guys! The show where our professionalism is your biggest concern, because it certainly isn't ours.
[7.00 --> 17.00]  Sorry, I'm eating again on the show. I know this is something that you guys prefer that I don't do, but quite frankly, I've had nothing but, like, a cup of oatmeal since early this morning, so...
[17.00 --> 18.00]  I had that one taquito.
[18.00 --> 19.00]  These are disgusting, by the way.
[19.00 --> 20.00]  I know.
[20.00 --> 21.00]  Thank you for giving it to me, though.
[21.00 --> 26.00]  The best part is, they're not super bad if you cook them in the oven, but then it takes half an hour and we have five minutes.
[26.00 --> 28.00]  I'd rather be disgusted than dead, I suppose.
[28.00 --> 29.00]  Exactly.
[29.00 --> 30.00]  I appreciate that.
[30.00 --> 31.00]  Yeah.
[31.00 --> 33.00]  So guys, we've got a lot of great topics for you today.
[33.00 --> 39.00]  First of all, our special guest is Kyle from Awesome Sauce News, or Newegg, I guess is the other place he is from.
[39.00 --> 40.00]  Ugh.
[40.00 --> 44.00]  We've also got some pretty interesting crowdfunding news.
[44.00 --> 56.00]  Star Citizen just keeps on trucking, so they hit $31 million of funding on the 25th, and then $32 million of funding on the 26th of November.
[56.00 --> 59.00]  So it's still rolling over there.
[59.00 --> 66.00]  We've also got some exciting new developments with respect to Qualcomm's upcoming Snapdragon 805 CPU.
[66.00 --> 73.00]  They're making some improvements to the CPU itself, but much of the improvement looks like it's going to be coming on the graphic side of things.
[73.00 --> 79.00]  I think I already said Kyle from Newegg will join us, so I'm going a little out of order here, but what are your topics to introduce?
[79.00 --> 83.00]  We have 24-inch 4K panels on the way from Dell, which are an IPS variant.
[83.00 --> 86.00]  Well, we don't personally, but if anyone from Dell is watching...
[86.00 --> 90.00]  Then we should have some... I really want one of those models.
[90.00 --> 93.00]  Because we're super professionals, so you should have us have a look at it.
[93.00 --> 94.00]  Exactly, yeah.
[94.00 --> 97.00]  You can eat by the monitor while reviewing it.
[97.00 --> 99.00]  If that's something that you guys want.
[99.00 --> 104.00]  I can demonstrate the taquito juiceness resistance of it.
[104.00 --> 105.00]  Yes, exactly.
[105.00 --> 109.00]  Just like I did with the Xperia Z1, where I went in the bath with it on camera.
[109.00 --> 111.00]  But we won't go in the bath with your monitor.
[111.00 --> 113.00]  We won't go in the bath with the monitor.
[113.00 --> 114.00]  No.
[114.00 --> 121.00]  There's also news that the US military is the biggest pirate of all of them, which is absolutely ridiculous, but not that surprising.
[122.00 --> 124.00]  Unfortunately, and then...
[124.00 --> 126.00]  It's like, really? This is headline news?
[126.00 --> 127.00]  Yeah.
[127.00 --> 129.00]  Large organizations also pirate software.
[129.00 --> 132.00]  My favorite thing is the scale at which they pirated because they're like...
[132.00 --> 134.00]  Well, hold on. We'll go into more depth later.
[134.00 --> 135.00]  First, let's roll the intro.
[135.00 --> 136.00]  Yeah.
[139.00 --> 165.00]  Alright, so we're not powered by Razer comms anymore, so I'm just gonna cut that off right there.
[165.00 --> 166.00]  But...
[168.00 --> 170.00]  I guess that's like, pretty much it.
[170.00 --> 171.00]  What?
[171.00 --> 172.00]  What?
[172.00 --> 173.00]  Thanks for watching, guys.
[174.00 --> 175.00]  No, let's get right into...
[175.00 --> 176.00]  What?
[176.00 --> 178.00]  Let's get right into the Snapdragon 805 here.
[178.00 --> 182.00]  So the original article is from Anontek, so we're gonna go ahead and...
[182.00 --> 184.00]  Really? The mouse is too far. I can't reach it.
[185.00 --> 193.00]  The original article is from Anontek, so they've got a little cool picture of an adorable dragon, as well as a Qualcomm Snapdragon-looking chip.
[193.00 --> 195.00]  I want a pet dragon.
[195.00 --> 202.00]  And the main details here is that this is not so much a revolutionary change, it's more of an evolutionary change.
[202.00 --> 208.00]  So we're gonna be getting higher clock speeds up to 2.5 GHz, which is just, like...
[208.00 --> 209.00]  Doesn't seem right.
[209.00 --> 214.00]  It doesn't seem like it should be right. It's like, yeah, we're gonna have 2.5 GHz quad cores in your phone.
[214.00 --> 223.00]  To be clear, guys, these are not the same kinds of quad cores that you're gonna find in a PlayStation 4 or in a PC or anything along those lines.
[223.00 --> 226.00]  But it is definitely a multi-threading monster.
[226.00 --> 231.00]  They're kinda adding more of everything.
[231.00 --> 234.00]  So more clock speed, a couple small improvements here and there.
[234.00 --> 237.00]  But the main improvements are really gonna be on the GPU.
[237.00 --> 242.00]  So we're going from Adreno 300 series to Adreno 400 series.
[242.00 --> 244.00]  They're gonna be called the 420, because...
[244.00 --> 247.00]  Because no research went into that name.
[247.00 --> 250.00]  No, I'm really in the mood for this snack right now.
[250.00 --> 251.00]  It's kinda disgusting, though.
[251.00 --> 254.00]  But anyways, some of the other things that you gain is...
[254.00 --> 255.00]  That was a joke.
[255.00 --> 260.00]  Oh, wow, that didn't clue in at all.
[260.00 --> 261.00]  I know.
[261.00 --> 263.00]  I get it.
[263.00 --> 267.00]  And, wow, our start time is 10 minutes after that, too.
[267.00 --> 268.00]  I know, right?
[268.00 --> 269.00]  That's kinda brutal.
[269.00 --> 272.00]  It's almost like all the stars are aligning.
[272.00 --> 277.00]  Anyways, you get 2.5 gigahertz, like you already said, 128-bit memory interface,
[277.00 --> 282.00]  Direct3D 11 class graphics, and freakin' OpenCL 1.2 full profile.
[282.00 --> 287.00]  Which is amazing, because as much as guys like AMD are talking about,
[287.00 --> 290.00]  Okay, we're gonna have, like, OpenCL acceleration,
[290.00 --> 294.00]  and you're gonna be able to, like, batch process Photoshop files,
[294.00 --> 295.00]  because everyone does that, right?
[295.00 --> 297.00]  You can use OpenCL to accelerate that.
[297.00 --> 299.00]  On something like a phone?
[299.00 --> 302.00]  All of a sudden, OpenCL is gonna make a ton of sense,
[302.00 --> 305.00]  because think of everything from Instagram filters to...
[305.00 --> 308.00]  You're much more likely to be batch processing things.
[308.00 --> 309.00]  Exactly.
[309.00 --> 310.00]  Way more likely.
[310.00 --> 313.00]  And you're gonna have, like, these specific tasks that you perform
[313.00 --> 319.00]  that are going to be able to take advantage, not only of the improved performance
[319.00 --> 325.00]  that OpenCL, that GPU compute can provide, but also the fact that it's gonna be lower power consumption.
[325.00 --> 328.00]  And for something that plugs into my wall, I kinda sit there and I go,
[328.00 --> 330.00]  Yeah, I mean, that's cool, thank you.
[330.00 --> 333.00]  You know, it's great to have better power consumption, but at the end of the day,
[333.00 --> 337.00]  that extra, you know, couple of watts doesn't make the same difference to me that it does
[337.00 --> 341.00]  when my phone's running out of battery, you know, halfway through the day all the time.
[341.00 --> 344.00]  Actually, you know what? For all the complaints about Nexus 5...
[344.00 --> 347.00]  You and Brandon have not been having problems with battery life.
[347.00 --> 348.00]  I...
[348.00 --> 350.00]  Like, all of the internet has been having problems with battery life.
[350.00 --> 353.00]  It has not. If you know what? I think it comes down to...
[353.00 --> 355.00]  Sorry, I'm changing gears here, so I guess that was pretty...
[355.00 --> 359.00]  Oh, okay, now let's cover the last thing that's really exciting about Snapdragon 805,
[359.00 --> 364.00]  and that is the fact that it is gonna have not only hardware-accelerated H.264 encode and decode,
[364.00 --> 367.00]  but also H.265 decode.
[367.00 --> 373.00]  So that means, again, lower power consumption and the ability to enjoy some truly next-generation web content.
[373.00 --> 377.00]  Because H.265 is a much more efficient compression algorithm.
[377.00 --> 381.00]  However, it does require more processing power to decode it.
[381.00 --> 384.00]  So if you have hardware that is designed just for that,
[384.00 --> 389.00]  we're gonna be looking at things like 2.5K or 4K streams that can be decoded on your phone
[389.00 --> 392.00]  without a significant power consumption increase.
[392.00 --> 396.00]  So, like, thumbs up Qualcomm! You guys have gone from zero to absolute hero.
[396.00 --> 399.00]  Just because, you know, a couple other guys were like,
[399.00 --> 403.00]  Hey, yeah, we'd also like a chunk of this mobile processor market.
[403.00 --> 404.00]  No!
[404.00 --> 406.00]  Bad!
[406.00 --> 410.00]  They kinda did, though. That's exactly what they did, because they weren't moving that fast.
[410.00 --> 411.00]  No, they weren't.
[411.00 --> 412.00]  And then all of a sudden it's just like...
[412.00 --> 414.00]  They were content to just kinda hang.
[414.00 --> 415.00]  Yeah.
[415.00 --> 418.00]  And nowadays, you look at any smartphone, it's like, what processor's inside?
[418.00 --> 421.00]  No, no. What Qualcomm processor is inside it?
[421.00 --> 423.00]  Because it's like, oh, well it could be the Snapdragon 600!
[423.00 --> 424.00]  Or the 800!
[424.00 --> 425.00]  It could be clocked at 1.8 gigahertz!
[425.00 --> 427.00]  Oh, no, maybe 1.9 gigahertz!
[427.00 --> 429.00]  HTC One versus Samsung Galaxy S4!
[429.00 --> 432.00]  Which one has the same processor clocked slightly higher?
[432.00 --> 434.00]  Which one throttles less?
[434.00 --> 435.00]  Yes!
[435.00 --> 436.00]  Yes!
[436.00 --> 438.00]  It's true, though.
[438.00 --> 439.00]  No, it's totally true.
[439.00 --> 442.00]  It's even like, I was reading an article, this, we're gonna talk about this later on,
[442.00 --> 445.00]  but I was reading an article on the Galaxy S5.
[445.00 --> 446.00]  Mm-hmm.
[446.00 --> 450.00]  And it was literally in the thing, like, oh, which Qualcomm processor?
[450.00 --> 452.00]  Yeah, why don't we get into that, actually?
[452.00 --> 453.00]  We might as well.
[453.00 --> 456.00]  And then maybe we'll bring our special guest on right after that.
[456.00 --> 458.00]  So, this is a rumor, guys.
[458.00 --> 462.00]  So, the appropriate disclaimers, we are not saying that this is absolute news,
[462.00 --> 464.00]  but it was posted by YouBetterNot on the forum.
[464.00 --> 472.00]  And there's going to be a pair, like, as if Samsung doesn't already have a fragmented
[472.00 --> 479.00]  enough approach to their, I mean, even their, I think their Galaxy lineup of phones probably
[479.00 --> 484.00]  contains more phones than anyone else's whole lineup of phones.
[484.00 --> 487.00]  The best thing about this one, too, is there's the premium and the normal one, which you're
[487.00 --> 488.00]  going to get into in a second.
[488.00 --> 491.00]  And then there's, like, four different colors, I think, of each.
[491.00 --> 492.00]  Oh.
[492.00 --> 496.00]  So, I couldn't get a confirmation on the colors, but I know there's, like, a red one and a
[496.00 --> 499.00]  white one, and I think a black one, and I think a blue one.
[499.00 --> 500.00]  So, the...
[500.00 --> 502.00]  There's so many.
[502.00 --> 506.00]  So, the rumors are that the average, sort of, the consumer...
[506.00 --> 510.00]  I mean, remember when the S4 was a flagship device, or the S series was flagship?
[510.00 --> 514.00]  Now the S series is like, well, there's a mini one that's like, it's like that, but smaller,
[514.00 --> 515.00]  and also much crappier.
[515.00 --> 520.00]  And then there's going to be a normal plastic one with an OLED display, and then there's
[520.00 --> 525.00]  going to be a premium version, sporting a metal case and a flexible OLED display, and
[525.00 --> 531.00]  all of these rumors combined together are interesting, but then there's also the bombshell rumor.
[531.00 --> 537.00]  The possibility of 2560 by 1440p, which is like, whaaaaat?
[537.00 --> 538.00]  Okay.
[538.00 --> 540.00]  And a 5.3 inch display.
[540.00 --> 549.00]  As someone who is getting pretty used to 1080p, I can tell the difference between the Moto X and the HTC One.
[549.00 --> 552.00]  I can, but barely.
[552.00 --> 553.00]  Barely.
[553.00 --> 560.00]  If we're talking about significantly, dramatically increasing that resolution again, we're going
[560.00 --> 566.00]  to be talking about making battery life worse for no apparent reason other than to, you know,
[566.00 --> 573.00]  have, you know, a measuring contest, an arm measuring contest, a third arm measuring contest.
[573.00 --> 574.00]  Wow.
[574.00 --> 575.00]  You almost made it.
[575.00 --> 576.00]  I know, I almost made it.
[576.00 --> 577.00]  You're so close.
[577.00 --> 582.00]  You know what's funny is I was even talking to, I was talking to Ed today about how, you
[582.00 --> 587.00]  know, oh, I've seen a couple of complaints lately about the amount of innuendo on the
[587.00 --> 590.00]  show, and like, apparently someone was upset when I put that Bluetooth speaker in my pants
[590.00 --> 592.00]  and talked to you, and I was like, hey, you're in my pants.
[592.00 --> 594.00]  Yeah, well, I read this thing.
[594.00 --> 597.00]  Yeah, so, I almost made it through that.
[597.00 --> 599.00]  So I've almost changed.
[599.00 --> 600.00]  Almost.
[600.00 --> 601.00]  Almost.
[601.00 --> 602.00]  Almost.
[602.00 --> 606.00]  So there's, the rumor is there's going to be a 64-bit Exynos, I don't even know how to
[606.00 --> 607.00]  pronounce that.
[607.00 --> 608.00]  Exynos?
[608.00 --> 609.00]  Exynos?
[609.00 --> 610.00]  Whatever.
[610.00 --> 613.00]  Anyway, or Snapdragon processor, 3 or 4 gigs of RAM, 4,000 milliamp hour battery.
[613.00 --> 618.00]  That's going to be either awesome for battery life or it's just going to be necessary to
[618.00 --> 619.00]  drive that display.
[619.00 --> 624.00]  And there's even some vague rumors about a retina scanner, so none of this is confirmed,
[624.00 --> 627.00]  but big thanks to You Better Not for posting news on the Linus Tech Tips forum.
[627.00 --> 630.00]  Honestly, it's where I get 90% of my news from these days.
[630.00 --> 631.00]  Yeah.
[631.00 --> 632.00]  From the tech world.
[632.00 --> 634.00]  It's extremely active, so you guys should check it out if you haven't seen it already.
[634.00 --> 636.00]  And with the new hot deals section.
[636.00 --> 638.00]  It's actually, hot deals have been pretty active so far.
[638.00 --> 639.00]  It's actually kind of cool.
[639.00 --> 641.00]  I'm happy that it's been working out.
[641.00 --> 642.00]  We probably should have done it before.
[642.00 --> 647.00]  Honestly guys, we were a little bit afraid that people were going to spam it or there's
[647.00 --> 653.00]  going to be a lot of, hey I'm, you know, selling, you know, tickets to my friends play
[653.00 --> 654.00]  that you should probably go to, please.
[654.00 --> 655.00]  There's been a bit of it.
[655.00 --> 656.00]  Yeah, there's been a little bit of that, but.
[656.00 --> 657.00]  We've been working on it.
[657.00 --> 658.00]  Okay.
[658.00 --> 662.00]  I would like to talk about battery life on the Nexus 5, because my, I'm going to film
[662.00 --> 663.00]  my Nexus 5 review next week.
[663.00 --> 665.00]  I'm feeling really comfortable with the device now.
[665.00 --> 667.00]  I've spent quite a lot of time with it.
[667.00 --> 674.00]  And I think that the, that the issues some people are having with battery life are being mitigated
[674.00 --> 676.00]  somewhat by the way that I use it.
[676.00 --> 683.00]  So number one is I, I'm not a super hardcore power user in some ways, but I do get a lot
[683.00 --> 685.00]  of incoming and outgoing messages.
[685.00 --> 690.00]  So because I have a pebble and because I've actually just started using Google glass,
[690.00 --> 692.00]  although speaking of battery life, the battery is dead on that.
[692.00 --> 695.00]  So it's sitting over there on the charger.
[695.00 --> 699.50]  Because I am able to do a lot of my reading here, even though I'm hitting it a little bit
[699.50 --> 701.00]  harder on the Bluetooth side of things.
[701.00 --> 705.00]  What I've noticed about the Nexus 5 is that Bluetooth doesn't affect, seem to affect it
[705.00 --> 708.00]  nearly as much as other devices that I've used.
[708.00 --> 709.00]  So this could be a KitKat optimization.
[709.00 --> 714.00]  I'm going to look into it a little bit further before I do my review, but Bluetooth doesn't
[714.00 --> 715.00]  seem to hurt it that much.
[715.00 --> 719.00]  Number two is I'm not turning my screen on constantly because I'm looking and reading
[719.00 --> 723.00]  a lot of my messages on my smartwatch instead of on the device itself.
[723.00 --> 727.00]  Number three is that tethering is something that really kills battery life a lot for me,
[727.00 --> 730.00]  and it doesn't seem to get hit as hard when I'm tethering either.
[730.00 --> 734.00]  Like the one just burns through the battery when I'm tethering.
[734.00 --> 736.00]  But then that one has problems tethering, does it not?
[736.00 --> 739.00]  Um, no, it doesn't have problems. It just burns through the battery and runs really hot.
[739.00 --> 741.00]  But we've had problems connecting to it.
[741.00 --> 743.00]  You're thinking of the, uh, the old one.
[743.00 --> 745.00]  You're thinking of the iPhone 4.
[745.00 --> 747.00]  That was the one that never worked.
[747.00 --> 748.00]  I thought I was thinking of the X.
[748.00 --> 749.00]  The one that saved us that day at the studio.
[749.00 --> 750.00]  The X.
[750.00 --> 751.00]  Oh, okay.
[751.00 --> 752.00]  I was thinking of the Moto X.
[752.00 --> 754.00]  Yeah, so, so there's all those things going for it so far.
[754.00 --> 758.00]  And then there's also the fact that it has some pretty smart power saving features.
[758.00 --> 766.00]  So I don't spend maybe a lot, I don't spend much of my time, um, how do I explain this?
[766.00 --> 767.00]  Okay.
[767.00 --> 771.00]  Wi-Fi networks, whenever you're not in range of them, it can just turn the Wi-Fi off.
[771.00 --> 774.00]  So your GPS will pick up, it'll go, okay, you're here, I'm turning my Wi-Fi back on.
[774.00 --> 779.00]  This is a smart power saving feature that some previous Android phones had, like the Xperia Z1 had it.
[779.00 --> 781.00]  And I was really impressed with the battery life there.
[781.00 --> 784.00]  But I feel like that's been saving me a lot of battery life as well.
[784.00 --> 787.00]  So I'm getting through the day very consistently with the Nexus 5.
[787.00 --> 790.00]  And I think the last thing is that it depends what you're coming from.
[790.00 --> 796.00]  If I was coming from the Xperia Z1, which I did use for a while, but it wasn't my daily driver really.
[796.00 --> 798.00]  I used it for about two and a half, three weeks.
[798.00 --> 801.00]  Um, coming from the HTC One, battery life feels okay.
[801.00 --> 804.00]  Because the One doesn't have fantastic battery life by any stretch.
[804.00 --> 810.00]  So, Nexus 5, the complaints about your battery life seem to be a little bit exaggerated in my mind.
[810.00 --> 815.00]  But I do have plenty of complaints about the Nexus 5, so stay tuned for my upcoming video.
[815.00 --> 817.00]  Why don't we bring Kyle on? Are we ready to rock?
[817.00 --> 819.00]  Sure. It's a little bit early.
[819.00 --> 820.00]  It's a little bit early.
[820.00 --> 822.00]  I think we were trying to do a quick show today anyway, so...
[822.00 --> 824.00]  I think he said he'd be back by now, so we'll see if he's back.
[824.00 --> 829.00]  We have a very secret thing to do after work today.
[829.00 --> 833.00]  And then once we're done, we're going to be telling you guys about it.
[833.00 --> 835.00]  Sounds like he's under attack by aliens.
[835.00 --> 836.00]  Yeah.
[836.00 --> 837.00]  From 1980?
[837.00 --> 838.00]  Yeah.
[838.00 --> 839.00]  Kyle!
[839.00 --> 840.00]  Kyle!
[840.00 --> 841.00]  Kyle!
[841.00 --> 842.00]  Sorry!
[842.00 --> 843.00]  Hey!
[843.00 --> 844.00]  How are ya?
[844.00 --> 845.00]  I'm good, how are you?
[845.00 --> 846.00]  We are just fantastic!
[846.00 --> 849.00]  That is a great picture of you that you gave us for your lower third.
[849.00 --> 852.00]  Unless that was Edsel that picked that out for you.
[852.00 --> 853.00]  That might have been Edsel.
[853.00 --> 854.00]  I gotta commend him.
[854.00 --> 856.00]  Are you on speaker, sir?
[856.00 --> 857.00]  Yes, I am.
[857.00 --> 859.00]  Let me change that for you right now.
[859.00 --> 860.00]  I didn't realize what was up right now.
[860.00 --> 861.00]  Thank you!
[861.00 --> 866.00]  Sorry, we brought you in a little bit early because we missed the sound of your voice from the pre-show.
[866.00 --> 867.00]  How about now?
[867.00 --> 868.00]  How do I sound?
[868.00 --> 869.00]  You sound amazing.
[869.00 --> 870.00]  Awesome.
[870.00 --> 871.00]  Awesome.
[871.00 --> 872.00]  Awesome.
[872.00 --> 873.00]  Awesome.
[873.00 --> 874.00]  Some would say that it-
[874.00 --> 875.00]  Awesome as well.
[875.00 --> 876.00]  Awesome as well.
[876.00 --> 877.00]  Oh, come on!
[877.00 --> 878.00]  I was making my way there laboriously!
[878.00 --> 883.00]  So why don't you give a brief introduction of who the devil you are and what the devil you do,
[883.00 --> 886.00]  and why the devil anyone should care before we go any further into the show here?
[886.00 --> 888.16]  For those of our audience who haven't heard of you.
[888.84 --> 889.10]  Sure.
[889.42 --> 891.82]  First of all, you probably shouldn't care too much.
[892.82 --> 893.26]  Aww.
[893.80 --> 895.36]  He's playing the sympathy card.
[896.40 --> 896.80]  Duh.
[897.72 --> 899.00]  It does really well.
[899.16 --> 900.48]  You know, I've checked the metrics on it.
[901.08 --> 905.72]  But I am essentially a YouTube host for Newegg TV,
[906.28 --> 908.48]  which is a channel for Newegg.com.
[909.44 --> 909.98]  Great company.
[910.16 --> 910.50]  Boo.
[910.50 --> 911.74]  I also have my own.
[911.82 --> 912.18]  Yeah, I know.
[912.36 --> 912.58]  I know.
[913.16 --> 914.48]  They're NCIX also.
[914.48 --> 916.12]  So much respect for them as well.
[916.78 --> 917.64]  Gotta respect your roots.
[918.86 --> 921.50]  I'm also a YouTuber on the side.
[921.92 --> 924.20]  Personally, I have my own channel, Awesome Sauce News.
[925.00 --> 926.98]  And I can hear myself right now.
[927.62 --> 928.04]  Hold on.
[928.80 --> 929.16]  What's going on?
[930.70 --> 931.10]  Hmm.
[936.44 --> 936.88]  All right.
[936.90 --> 937.56]  I'm just going to roll with it.
[938.18 --> 938.58]  All right.
[938.66 --> 938.88]  Sweet.
[939.46 --> 939.70]  Yeah.
[939.94 --> 940.64]  That's what I do.
[940.64 --> 942.06]  I do tech unboxings.
[942.18 --> 942.62]  I do reviews.
[942.62 --> 946.00]  I do what you do, but on a much smaller scale, with a much smaller army.
[946.46 --> 946.74]  Excellent.
[946.74 --> 947.46]  It's more of a militia.
[947.76 --> 948.42]  A militia.
[948.94 --> 949.36]  All right.
[949.46 --> 953.48]  So, why don't we go ahead and move into our first guest topic here.
[953.88 --> 954.90]  So, ahem.
[956.98 --> 957.58]  The...
[957.58 --> 958.12]  Okay.
[958.32 --> 960.56]  So, you work at Newegg.
[960.60 --> 962.20]  Do you see any of the sales numbers at all?
[962.26 --> 964.42]  Or are you guessing as much as the rest of us are?
[965.60 --> 966.00]  Yes.
[966.06 --> 966.48]  The latter.
[966.78 --> 968.90]  They refuse to let me see anything important.
[968.90 --> 969.62]  That...
[969.62 --> 970.32]  That is awesome.
[970.40 --> 970.60]  Okay.
[970.74 --> 975.78]  Well, have you heard any scuttlebutt about 290 sales versus 290x sales?
[976.88 --> 977.12]  No.
[977.28 --> 978.20]  Actually, not at all.
[978.38 --> 978.46]  Okay.
[978.46 --> 979.40]  I haven't really looked into it.
[979.44 --> 980.70]  I haven't really heard too much.
[980.82 --> 981.56]  I'm kind of in my bubble.
[982.86 --> 983.56]  Scuttlebutt's a word.
[984.18 --> 984.66]  Scuttlebutt.
[984.84 --> 985.66]  That is a word.
[985.90 --> 986.46]  I like it.
[987.42 --> 988.54]  It means rumors.
[988.82 --> 991.08]  I know, but you just said scuttlebutt.
[991.14 --> 992.26]  I know, but it's a word.
[992.56 --> 993.10]  I know.
[993.10 --> 995.12]  It's already up on Urban Dictionary by now.
[995.20 --> 995.52]  Yeah.
[995.72 --> 996.66]  In five seconds.
[996.74 --> 997.62]  It was already a word.
[997.66 --> 998.28]  I know it is.
[998.34 --> 998.60]  I know.
[998.64 --> 999.24]  I know it's a word.
[999.34 --> 1000.02]  Well, you know what?
[1000.04 --> 1000.54]  It's just hilarious.
[1000.66 --> 1009.54]  We're going to go to my screen where Chris XLXXX posted that the Radeon R9 290 can no longer
[1009.54 --> 1010.80]  be flashed.
[1010.80 --> 1015.36]  Now, there was a thing going on for a little while here where folks were able to buy Radeon
[1015.36 --> 1020.80]  R9 290s and with a simple BIOS flash, turn them into R9 290Xs.
[1020.80 --> 1028.38]  It turns out that this was only from specific batches and only worked with XFX and power
[1028.38 --> 1029.20]  color cards.
[1029.26 --> 1031.36]  So that was all that was going on.
[1031.42 --> 1033.54]  So now 290s can no longer be unlocked.
[1033.64 --> 1038.92]  But what does this tell you guys about the difference between an R9 290 and a 290X?
[1038.92 --> 1048.76]  I'm assuming he cannot hear us now.
[1050.04 --> 1050.76]  Oh, me?
[1050.98 --> 1051.22]  Yeah.
[1051.22 --> 1052.62]  Oh, I didn't know.
[1052.70 --> 1053.76]  I thought you said guys.
[1053.84 --> 1054.94]  I thought you were asking the audience.
[1055.08 --> 1055.34]  Oh, no.
[1055.40 --> 1056.04]  I'm talking to you.
[1056.04 --> 1057.00]  I'm talking to you and Luke.
[1057.56 --> 1058.38]  Oh, right.
[1059.36 --> 1062.80]  Honestly, I think it says they're very similar.
[1062.80 --> 1068.80]  And for some reason, AMD doesn't want the 290 to be unlocked for monetary reasons, I'm
[1068.80 --> 1069.06]  assuming.
[1069.84 --> 1072.78]  But I feel like that kind of defeats the whole purpose of PC building.
[1072.90 --> 1078.38]  That's one of the reasons I love it so much is because we're not forced to deal with an
[1078.38 --> 1079.94]  all-in-one built console.
[1079.94 --> 1085.78]  We like to tweak and tune our hardware and I feel like that kind of limits that ability.
[1086.08 --> 1086.94]  So tell me something.
[1087.04 --> 1088.78]  Have you bought one of the next-gen consoles?
[1089.86 --> 1090.12]  No.
[1090.24 --> 1090.74]  No, I have not.
[1090.82 --> 1091.68]  Are you planning to?
[1092.30 --> 1092.66]  No.
[1092.82 --> 1093.24]  No, I'm not.
[1093.40 --> 1093.64]  Okay.
[1093.78 --> 1097.62]  Give me your PC Master Race opinion here then.
[1098.08 --> 1102.32]  If you had to buy a console, if someone took away your PC from you, held a gun to your
[1102.32 --> 1106.16]  head, and says you can only have an Xbox One or a PlayStation 4, that's all you can have.
[1106.16 --> 1106.80]  What about a Wii U?
[1107.34 --> 1108.36]  What about a Wii U?
[1108.36 --> 1109.88]  I would go with a Wii U.
[1109.94 --> 1112.74]  I would go with a 3DS and play Pokemon X and Y all day.
[1112.74 --> 1113.16]  Boom!
[1114.06 --> 1114.38]  Okay.
[1114.58 --> 1114.96]  Kyle's a man.
[1115.34 --> 1115.58]  Alright.
[1115.90 --> 1116.32]  You know what?
[1116.36 --> 1117.72]  I guess I can't actually...
[1117.72 --> 1118.36]  Man by Wii U.
[1118.46 --> 1119.72]  Wii U's are so underrated.
[1120.08 --> 1120.56]  You know what?
[1120.68 --> 1120.98]  They are.
[1121.28 --> 1124.68]  My first all-nighter was playing Pokemon.
[1125.08 --> 1125.44]  Boom.
[1125.60 --> 1126.52]  Back on Game Boy Color.
[1126.56 --> 1127.06]  There you go.
[1127.48 --> 1128.60]  You can still buy Pokemon.
[1128.82 --> 1130.78]  That was my very first all-nighter.
[1130.78 --> 1131.08]  For 3DS.
[1131.08 --> 1132.74]  But still, we use Epic.
[1132.90 --> 1134.64]  There's some really good games.
[1135.44 --> 1135.76]  I don't know.
[1135.88 --> 1136.20]  I agree.
[1136.92 --> 1137.24]  Alright.
[1137.40 --> 1137.74]  Fair enough.
[1137.74 --> 1141.84]  Honestly, if I had to pick between the two consoles, I would probably go with the PS4.
[1142.46 --> 1146.50]  Just because I was a PS3 guy back in the day, and I always had a good experience with them.
[1146.60 --> 1149.94]  My Xbox 360 got the red ring, and obviously that's not an issue anymore.
[1150.50 --> 1151.36]  But I don't know.
[1151.40 --> 1154.90]  I feel like the community on the PlayStation Network was a bit more mature.
[1155.20 --> 1156.72]  A little bit on the same page as me.
[1157.08 --> 1160.72]  As opposed to the Xbox 360 kids that were always yelling at me for being a noob.
[1161.38 --> 1161.92]  Calling me names.
[1163.70 --> 1167.84]  So basically, you're saying that the noobs are more friendly to each other on the PlayStation.
[1167.84 --> 1169.62]  So are you calling PS4 a noob console?
[1170.46 --> 1170.82]  No.
[1170.82 --> 1173.80]  I'm calling it a more down-to-earth console.
[1174.26 --> 1174.66]  I see.
[1174.92 --> 1175.14]  Okay.
[1175.22 --> 1177.60]  So a little bit less rabid in terms of the fanboyism.
[1178.02 --> 1178.38]  Exactly.
[1178.38 --> 1180.36]  All right, let's move on to our next topic here.
[1180.46 --> 1182.24]  You actually brought this up with us.
[1184.64 --> 1193.36]  A very unfortunate man by the name of James Howells has lost 4 million Great Britain pounds
[1193.36 --> 1197.34]  worth of Bitcoins that were stored on an old hard drive.
[1198.16 --> 1198.36]  Yes.
[1198.56 --> 1200.50]  Kyle, have you invested any money into Bitcoin?
[1201.50 --> 1203.72]  No, but I'm really starting to think I should be.
[1204.58 --> 1205.00]  Is it?
[1205.22 --> 1205.52]  Oh.
[1206.14 --> 1206.32]  Yeah.
[1206.66 --> 1207.08]  Go ahead.
[1207.08 --> 1207.98]  Sorry about that.
[1207.98 --> 1209.82]  I had my stream running.
[1209.90 --> 1210.36]  Sorry about that.
[1210.68 --> 1211.42]  So, okay.
[1212.12 --> 1214.50]  At this point, do you feel like it's a little bit too late?
[1216.60 --> 1218.40]  You know, I think it's never too late.
[1218.78 --> 1223.26]  I think it's later than I would have liked to have been interested in the whole thing.
[1223.68 --> 1227.04]  But you never know how much higher it can go from here.
[1227.04 --> 1231.50]  You know, I'm thinking about doing a Bitcoin mining build.
[1231.50 --> 1232.46]  Right.
[1232.46 --> 1234.30]  You know, maybe for my channel or something like that.
[1234.30 --> 1239.58]  The problem with Bitcoin mining is that it's gotten to the point where the hardware has stopped
[1239.58 --> 1241.68]  getting so much more powerful so fast.
[1242.14 --> 1245.52]  And Bitcoins have become so difficult to find that unless you're buying...
[1245.52 --> 1248.38]  I mean, I don't know if you know this, but they actually have dedicated boxes.
[1248.60 --> 1249.84]  Maybe you know a little bit more.
[1250.04 --> 1250.22]  Yeah.
[1250.22 --> 1253.92]  They have dedicated boxes that are just for Bitcoin mining.
[1254.00 --> 1254.54]  That's all they do.
[1254.62 --> 1255.08]  It's an appliance.
[1255.18 --> 1257.22]  You plug it into a wall and it Bitcoin mines.
[1257.24 --> 1261.36]  They're built specifically for it, though, and they'll really outpower whatever else you
[1261.36 --> 1261.98]  can do, pretty much.
[1262.88 --> 1265.92]  I feel like your electricity would...
[1265.92 --> 1266.92]  Oh, sorry.
[1267.14 --> 1271.02]  The electricity bill would outweigh the money that you'd be getting from Bitcoin mining.
[1271.18 --> 1274.98]  Because isn't it pretty taxing on your system and just consumes a crap ton of power from
[1274.98 --> 1275.34]  what I've heard?
[1275.34 --> 1279.22]  Well, that is the problem that a lot of people had, even at the beginning of Bitcoin, was
[1279.22 --> 1280.66]  that it wasn't really worth that much.
[1280.76 --> 1285.54]  And I think that most of the calculations that I saw people doing were, okay, here's
[1285.54 --> 1286.48]  how much Bitcoin's worth.
[1286.86 --> 1288.50]  Here's how much my electricity costs.
[1288.80 --> 1293.58]  And they weren't necessarily factoring in what if Bitcoin is worth a hundred times what
[1293.58 --> 1295.56]  it is today, not that long from now.
[1296.16 --> 1299.00]  And so that was the thing that kept a lot of people from getting into Bitcoin mining.
[1299.06 --> 1302.80]  That's honestly the reason that I actually set up a mining box.
[1302.94 --> 1304.62]  And then I was like, okay, forget it.
[1304.62 --> 1306.50]  So one, there's a few things you can do.
[1306.64 --> 1310.78]  You can join a pool because solo mining, it can take like a year for you to get your
[1310.78 --> 1312.58]  own Bitcoin block.
[1313.00 --> 1318.04]  If you join a pool, your whole group is calculating towards Bitcoins and you can get a cut, which
[1318.04 --> 1318.68]  is a good idea.
[1318.78 --> 1323.50]  And then for two, you can go to, I think it's like BitcoinCalculator.com or just Google Bitcoin
[1323.50 --> 1323.94]  calculator.
[1324.16 --> 1326.66]  And you can figure out like your costs versus your gains.
[1326.66 --> 1329.82]  And it helps you figure out whether or not it'll be worth it for you because power around
[1329.82 --> 1330.44]  the world is different.
[1330.68 --> 1332.70]  So there's two different things to think about.
[1332.70 --> 1334.44]  Guys, we'd love to do a Twitter blitz.
[1334.52 --> 1337.76]  So if you have any questions or anything you want to ask Kyle, maybe like, what's it like
[1337.76 --> 1338.56]  working with Paul?
[1339.22 --> 1344.76]  You know, anything like that, guys, hit us up at Linus Tech on Twitter and let us know
[1344.76 --> 1347.38]  if you have any questions for the one and only Kyle.
[1347.38 --> 1354.52]  So my Google Docs just randomly signed out for no apparent reason.
[1354.52 --> 1358.86]  So I have apparently lost my ability to find our next topic here.
[1359.42 --> 1360.04]  And this laptop...
[1360.04 --> 1361.96]  680 Ti, 6 gigabyte edition.
[1362.28 --> 1362.70]  Yeah.
[1362.90 --> 1363.62]  Did you hear about this?
[1364.60 --> 1365.02]  You know what?
[1365.10 --> 1367.32]  This is the first time I've heard about it from that list.
[1367.44 --> 1367.80]  What?
[1368.14 --> 1369.12]  Actually pretty cool.
[1369.34 --> 1371.86]  My favorite part is no TDP, unlock voltages.
[1372.56 --> 1373.58]  Yeah, that's pretty awesome.
[1373.62 --> 1374.24]  Holy crap.
[1374.32 --> 1377.86]  Because 680 Ti is like a beast card and it has overclocking headroom sitting there.
[1378.22 --> 1378.68]  It does.
[1378.78 --> 1379.08]  Oh, yeah.
[1380.02 --> 1382.68]  It won't go over certain temperatures even if you set it higher.
[1382.92 --> 1383.76]  There's like a few things.
[1384.60 --> 1388.88]  Now, do you guys know if this is a new model that NVIDIA has put out or if this is just
[1388.88 --> 1393.12]  like a bare bones 780 Ti that EVGA has kind of tweaked?
[1393.42 --> 1395.60]  Well, what I think has happened here is two things.
[1395.60 --> 1402.02]  Number one is this has got to be EVGA pressing really hard on NVIDIA to give them the flexibility
[1402.02 --> 1404.80]  to deliver the cards that they want to build to their customers.
[1405.00 --> 1410.12]  I know a couple guys at EVGA and I know how they feel about stuff like Project Greenlight,
[1410.26 --> 1415.86]  which was NVIDIA's program that they put in place to restrict the board partner's ability
[1415.86 --> 1422.44]  to RMA dead cards back to NVIDIA if they did anything that goes outside of the guidelines
[1422.44 --> 1428.36]  with respect to power consumption, voltage, and clock speeds, particularly voltage increases
[1428.36 --> 1430.16]  on the GPU that would cause them to die.
[1430.26 --> 1433.22]  So NVIDIA put this green light thing in place that basically went, look, do whatever you
[1433.22 --> 1435.54]  want, but don't come crying to us when it dies.
[1435.60 --> 1441.80]  And this is both reasonable and a little bit just kind of kneecapping in terms of what
[1441.80 --> 1445.22]  the board partners can do because AMD doesn't put the same restrictions in place or at least
[1445.22 --> 1447.64]  not ones that are nearly as restrictive.
[1447.86 --> 1452.02]  I mean, they're still like, hey, you know, don't do anything phenomenally stupid, but you
[1452.02 --> 1453.06]  have a little bit more flexibility.
[1453.56 --> 1461.86]  So for 780 Ti 6 gig here, it looks like EVGA has pushed NVIDIA to get the green light on
[1461.86 --> 1467.08]  a card that is just going to be completely balls to the wall unlocked.
[1467.08 --> 1473.28]  The first thing I did when I saw this is I was like, EVGA, I am so sorry that I haven't
[1473.28 --> 1475.14]  finished that Hadron Air unboxing yet.
[1476.50 --> 1477.80]  I will do it right away.
[1478.12 --> 1479.30]  I need one of these cards.
[1480.92 --> 1482.70]  And they're like, yeah, dude, we'll put you on the list.
[1482.76 --> 1483.26]  I'm like, yes.
[1484.88 --> 1485.86]  I don't think you knew that.
[1486.04 --> 1486.46]  That's all this has been.
[1486.62 --> 1488.88]  They're holding the card hostage until you do that video.
[1489.18 --> 1490.84]  What profits card do you run at home these days?
[1491.96 --> 1492.48]  You know what?
[1492.54 --> 1495.84]  Honestly, I haven't been doing a huge amount of gaming lately just because I've been so
[1495.84 --> 1498.88]  busy, but I still have a GTX 670 in my rig.
[1498.88 --> 1505.52]  It's an Asus DirectCU 2, and honestly, I do have like a 770 lying around that I just
[1505.52 --> 1508.96]  don't know why I haven't installed yet, but I probably should.
[1509.20 --> 1509.64]  Is it Air?
[1510.76 --> 1511.44]  Yeah, it's Air.
[1511.80 --> 1513.30]  You have no excuse, sir.
[1513.56 --> 1514.00]  Yeah.
[1514.66 --> 1517.30]  Air-cooled graphics card upgrade not happening?
[1517.42 --> 1518.32]  No time at all.
[1518.46 --> 1518.94]  I know.
[1519.48 --> 1522.04]  It's really just because I haven't done much gaming at all.
[1522.52 --> 1524.12]  Cry yourself to sleep every night.
[1524.22 --> 1525.50]  We're going to go to our Twitter bits here.
[1525.50 --> 1528.22]  All right, guys.
[1528.34 --> 1531.68]  So first up, what's your main rig?
[1532.16 --> 1532.40]  Okay.
[1532.78 --> 1533.16]  You know what?
[1533.22 --> 1534.64]  Here, why don't you answer Ricardo here?
[1534.72 --> 1536.50]  What is your main rig?
[1536.58 --> 1537.92]  So aside from the graphics card.
[1538.72 --> 1538.96]  Okay.
[1539.44 --> 1542.02]  Right now, I'm still a couple generations behind.
[1542.22 --> 1543.92]  I've got a Core i7 2600K.
[1544.16 --> 1545.78]  It's overclocked to 4,400 megahertz.
[1546.06 --> 1547.80]  Which is still about as good as it gets.
[1548.12 --> 1548.22]  So.
[1548.58 --> 1548.82]  Yes.
[1549.08 --> 1549.90]  Yeah, exactly.
[1550.26 --> 1552.40]  I mean, it's doing everything I need it to right now.
[1552.40 --> 1554.86]  I'm just doing a lot of editing and it's handling it beautifully.
[1555.52 --> 1556.72]  Render times could be a bit faster.
[1557.02 --> 1560.16]  But I am planning on upgrading to an X79 platform pretty soon.
[1560.98 --> 1562.48]  Have you heard of the Intel?
[1562.82 --> 1564.48]  It's like the retail edge program.
[1564.70 --> 1564.84]  Yeah.
[1565.66 --> 1566.02]  Yeah.
[1566.02 --> 1570.86]  So I think they're having a ridiculous deal on the 4th where you can get a 4930K for,
[1571.06 --> 1572.60]  what is it, like 190 bucks.
[1573.34 --> 1575.20]  You know what else I heard about the retail edge program?
[1575.40 --> 1578.14]  I heard that technically you're not eligible for it.
[1578.92 --> 1579.50]  Oh, really?
[1579.74 --> 1580.00]  Yeah.
[1580.48 --> 1581.90]  I already did my time.
[1581.96 --> 1583.18]  I already got 10,000 points.
[1583.28 --> 1584.98]  So I got the voucher for the deal.
[1585.06 --> 1588.04]  I'm going to call Intel and I'm going to tell them that you don't work at a retail store.
[1588.76 --> 1589.28]  How dare you?
[1590.20 --> 1592.28]  I had it for like six years after I worked at one.
[1592.28 --> 1592.64]  Yeah.
[1592.76 --> 1593.38]  Retail edge.
[1593.74 --> 1595.84]  Well, did you ever try to claim any of the deals?
[1595.96 --> 1596.18]  Oh, yeah.
[1596.30 --> 1596.70]  Oh, okay.
[1596.78 --> 1597.52]  That's unusual.
[1597.74 --> 1598.36]  Because I had to...
[1598.36 --> 1599.26]  There's ways to do it.
[1599.52 --> 1601.76]  When I first submitted, I had to submit like...
[1601.76 --> 1603.42]  Oh, well, I guess you could fake pay stubs.
[1603.56 --> 1603.70]  Yeah.
[1603.92 --> 1604.16]  Yeah.
[1604.26 --> 1604.84]  I did that a few times.
[1604.84 --> 1605.66]  Photoshop is a thing.
[1605.76 --> 1605.92]  Yeah.
[1606.00 --> 1606.28]  Photoshop.
[1607.14 --> 1608.44]  So what I used to do to get the deals...
[1608.44 --> 1609.66]  Not that I actually did that.
[1610.18 --> 1610.44]  Okay.
[1610.64 --> 1610.84]  Wink, wink.
[1611.10 --> 1612.02]  The second...
[1612.02 --> 1614.44]  The first time I did retail edge, I did everything legit.
[1614.58 --> 1616.20]  I actually went to a live event.
[1616.36 --> 1619.46]  So I was able to bring a pay stub and like show it to them.
[1619.80 --> 1620.32]  Well, okay.
[1620.36 --> 1621.08]  It was sort of legit.
[1621.08 --> 1624.92]  Because I also brought my wife and Photoshopped one of my old pay stubs with her name on it
[1624.92 --> 1625.98]  so that I could get two of them.
[1627.28 --> 1628.60]  So you did use Photoshop.
[1628.74 --> 1630.16]  So she actually went to the...
[1630.16 --> 1632.12]  Well, I used MS Paint to be clear.
[1632.58 --> 1632.76]  Oh.
[1633.24 --> 1637.22]  So she actually went to the event with me and got validated at the same time.
[1637.26 --> 1637.88]  Oh, God.
[1637.98 --> 1642.48]  Then the second time I wanted something from retail edge, this was back when I wanted like...
[1642.48 --> 1650.14]  Before I built my current rig, I always wanted like a raid card and multi SSD setup.
[1650.14 --> 1654.54]  Because I looked at SSD and I went, okay, this is perfect except it's not enough space.
[1654.68 --> 1657.22]  So I was like, okay, I'm willing to just drop all the money.
[1657.22 --> 1659.56]  So I found four coworkers.
[1659.94 --> 1664.52]  And this was back when each of them was like $300 or something stupid like that.
[1664.52 --> 1665.02]  Or like $200.
[1665.12 --> 1666.86]  Even on retail edge, it was like $200 or $300.
[1667.32 --> 1671.46]  And I got four X25M 80 gigs, I think.
[1671.68 --> 1672.62]  Or 160s.
[1672.62 --> 1673.12]  I don't remember.
[1673.22 --> 1675.30]  But it was like my second retail edge deal.
[1675.86 --> 1678.16]  And so that was the illegitimate thing there.
[1678.22 --> 1682.54]  Was I got a bunch of coworkers to sign me over their accounts so I could do all the quizzes.
[1683.96 --> 1684.32]  Nice.
[1684.78 --> 1686.92]  And then I don't remember.
[1687.02 --> 1688.56]  I think eventually I just got tired of it.
[1688.60 --> 1690.24]  Because retail edge used to be really easy.
[1690.32 --> 1691.78]  You could challenge all of the tests.
[1691.92 --> 1692.08]  Yeah.
[1692.08 --> 1694.58]  So if you knew the answers already, which I usually did.
[1694.66 --> 1697.66]  Because I had read the Anantek article four months earlier.
[1697.66 --> 1699.94]  Because it's not like they're showing off the latest stuff on there.
[1700.04 --> 1702.26]  Then I could just answer all the questions and I was good to go.
[1702.26 --> 1705.32]  But now they make you sit and watch stuff, right?
[1706.24 --> 1706.76]  You know what?
[1706.84 --> 1708.20]  That's true for some of them.
[1708.38 --> 1712.62]  But I noticed that maybe three out of five, I could just go straight to the quiz and get it over with.
[1713.18 --> 1715.34]  Maybe they've refined it a little bit.
[1716.10 --> 1722.64]  I think the one or two quizzes that I actually had to wait to watch that ridiculous tutorial.
[1723.16 --> 1727.90]  It was like a two-minute long TV soap opera type thing.
[1728.04 --> 1729.64]  And it was just the cheesiest thing I've ever seen.
[1729.98 --> 1731.08]  And they made me watch it.
[1731.08 --> 1733.52]  And I failed the test afterwards.
[1733.66 --> 1734.82]  Because I was distracted.
[1734.88 --> 1735.96]  So I had to watch it again.
[1736.70 --> 1737.86]  It was bad.
[1738.00 --> 1739.94]  I got to go to so many free movies because of those guys.
[1740.90 --> 1741.50]  So many free movies.
[1741.50 --> 1741.78]  Oh, yeah?
[1741.94 --> 1742.22]  Nice.
[1742.62 --> 1744.88]  Because they'd come by and be like, yeah, free Dark Knight screening.
[1745.78 --> 1746.10]  Awesome.
[1746.20 --> 1747.34]  I was like, all right, I'll go to that.
[1747.78 --> 1748.32]  Sounds good.
[1748.50 --> 1749.36]  I have no extra money.
[1749.40 --> 1750.12]  I want to see this movie.
[1750.78 --> 1751.10]  Awesome.
[1751.38 --> 1751.70]  Sweet.
[1752.48 --> 1755.30]  I'm still amazed how good your MS Paint skills are.
[1755.54 --> 1755.90]  I just can't get rid of it.
[1755.90 --> 1756.84]  Yeah, that's actually pretty impressive.
[1757.04 --> 1757.88]  No, I couldn't do it.
[1757.88 --> 1758.42]  My wife did it.
[1758.42 --> 1760.32]  Not that I did it, but...
[1760.32 --> 1761.04]  Even more impressive.
[1761.22 --> 1761.86]  Someone...
[1761.86 --> 1763.68]  I...
[1763.68 --> 1764.16]  I...
[1764.16 --> 1766.00]  Not that I...
[1766.00 --> 1766.52]  Yeah, whatever.
[1766.94 --> 1770.08]  I had automatic scripting things that would rewrite the date.
[1770.52 --> 1773.20]  And I could just sniffing tool and pull it in.
[1773.20 --> 1777.28]  So every single time that I had to change a date, I was just like, bloop, done.
[1777.52 --> 1778.86]  Took me like 10 seconds.
[1779.70 --> 1783.58]  I mean, Intel should have some more security behind that site, knowing that everybody that's
[1783.58 --> 1786.46]  applying for it is in the tech industry and is more or less tech savvy.
[1786.94 --> 1787.52]  I know.
[1787.54 --> 1788.62]  Way easy to hack into that.
[1788.72 --> 1789.76]  You would think that.
[1789.90 --> 1794.04]  You know, the funny thing about Retail Edge is I'm not convinced that anywhere near...
[1794.04 --> 1798.64]  Like, probably 20% of the people buying those things are actually putting them in their
[1798.64 --> 1798.94]  own systems.
[1798.94 --> 1799.88]  They're reselling it.
[1800.00 --> 1800.64]  All of them.
[1800.72 --> 1800.92]  Totally.
[1800.92 --> 1805.34]  If you check eBay immediately after Retail Edge thing, it's just like swamped with all
[1805.34 --> 1805.70]  of it.
[1806.32 --> 1806.70]  Mm-hmm.
[1806.90 --> 1807.64]  The flip fest.
[1807.92 --> 1808.20]  Yeah.
[1808.82 --> 1809.28]  It's ridiculous.
[1809.28 --> 1813.32]  Guys, it's going to be a real good time to buy a six-core Ivy Bridge-y real soon here.
[1814.70 --> 1816.80]  And it's always like extreme editions and stuff.
[1816.80 --> 1821.14]  So, like, people get these theoretically $1,000 processor.
[1821.14 --> 1822.78]  Or it used to be extreme editions all the time.
[1822.84 --> 1825.94]  So, people would get, like, 980Xs and stuff like that.
[1825.96 --> 1827.76]  And then they'd be like, oh, yeah, it's a $1,000 processor.
[1828.00 --> 1832.70]  And then everyone would, like, list them on Red Flag deals and on, like, you know, overclock.net.
[1832.76 --> 1834.78]  And they'd be like, ah, $875.
[1835.40 --> 1836.42]  And people would be like, yeah, no.
[1837.36 --> 1841.14]  That and there's, like, a hundred of you selling that exact chip right now.
[1841.76 --> 1842.50]  Yeah, no.
[1843.90 --> 1844.60]  See what you're up to.
[1845.08 --> 1845.72]  Pretty epic.
[1846.80 --> 1847.20]  All right.
[1847.34 --> 1848.50]  How are you guys' Thanksgiving?
[1849.66 --> 1851.48]  We have Thanksgiving a month before you.
[1852.28 --> 1853.16]  Oh, you're right.
[1853.76 --> 1854.36]  Oh, my gosh.
[1854.46 --> 1854.80]  I'm right?
[1854.80 --> 1856.08]  I'm such an out-of-touch American.
[1856.26 --> 1856.72]  I know.
[1856.86 --> 1857.20]  I know.
[1857.36 --> 1859.42]  We're just your hat to you, aren't we?
[1860.26 --> 1860.62]  Yes.
[1860.76 --> 1861.28]  Yes, indeed.
[1862.38 --> 1863.04]  I wish we could have...
[1863.04 --> 1863.44]  No, it was not mine.
[1863.44 --> 1867.58]  I saw this meme, and I wish it was true, where we could just have, like, second Thanksgiving,
[1867.84 --> 1868.48]  like The Hobbit.
[1868.82 --> 1869.76]  That would be awesome.
[1870.02 --> 1870.24]  Yeah.
[1870.64 --> 1871.28]  We should do that.
[1871.28 --> 1872.56]  We should just inherit the American Thanksgiving.
[1872.56 --> 1874.44]  Well, you know what's funny is it only took...
[1874.44 --> 1878.16]  Okay, Black Friday only started happening in Canada about five years ago.
[1878.52 --> 1880.54]  It only took five years, and now it's a thing.
[1880.98 --> 1881.18]  Yeah.
[1881.18 --> 1884.18]  So, if we just started this...
[1885.00 --> 1885.70]  Second Thanksgiving?
[1885.86 --> 1886.52]  Second Thanksgiving.
[1887.12 --> 1889.18]  We're thankful that America...
[1890.00 --> 1891.66]  Pilgrims Turkey.
[1891.72 --> 1892.80]  Hasn't blown us up yet.
[1893.00 --> 1893.32]  Yeah.
[1893.70 --> 1895.64]  Hasn't decided to invade us for a second time.
[1895.78 --> 1897.30]  Yeah, I'm really happy about that.
[1898.78 --> 1902.24]  We're glad that we're America's hat and not America's cup.
[1903.16 --> 1903.64]  Yeah.
[1904.24 --> 1904.72]  Yeah.
[1904.72 --> 1909.92]  You know, you're not going to last long around here on this here show.
[1911.22 --> 1912.10]  I love you guys.
[1912.20 --> 1917.48]  No, I was just in Toronto last weekend to cover an expo there, and everyone was very friendly,
[1917.70 --> 1919.52]  and I ate a lot of poutine and ketchup chips.
[1920.14 --> 1922.80]  We're from Vancouver, so we're not particularly fond of Toronto either.
[1923.36 --> 1923.76]  Leafs out.
[1923.76 --> 1923.98]  Oh, wow.
[1924.10 --> 1924.92]  You wouldn't know that.
[1924.92 --> 1925.96]  You have a lot of wars within Canada.
[1926.14 --> 1926.78]  That's harsh.
[1927.62 --> 1932.10]  Yeah, if there was a Canadian Civil War, it would be between, like, the Vancouver Canucks
[1932.10 --> 1933.42]  and, like, the Toronto Maple Leafs.
[1933.42 --> 1935.68]  Yeah, and there would just be this, like, huge walk in between.
[1935.68 --> 1936.44]  Yeah, there'd be, like...
[1936.44 --> 1941.18]  There'd be, like, an enormous ice rink, and then there would be no...
[1941.18 --> 1941.68]  We wouldn't even...
[1941.68 --> 1945.20]  We'd do away with the hockey sticks and the hockey pucks entirely, and everyone would just
[1945.20 --> 1946.74]  throw off their gloves and charge at each other.
[1946.98 --> 1947.16]  Yeah.
[1947.22 --> 1948.82]  That would be, like, the Canadian Civil War.
[1948.94 --> 1952.18]  Then afterwards, everyone would shake hands and go out for drinks, and then it'd be fun.
[1952.20 --> 1953.44]  Yeah, there'd be lots of beer.
[1953.44 --> 1955.72]  You'd all just compliment each other on your fighting skills.
[1955.92 --> 1962.08]  Yeah, the beer would both enhance the violence and enhance the camaraderie after the
[1962.08 --> 1962.34]  violence.
[1962.34 --> 1962.64]  Yep.
[1962.82 --> 1963.00]  Yep.
[1963.22 --> 1963.80]  That's right.
[1964.66 --> 1965.62]  Welcome to Canada.
[1967.16 --> 1967.98]  That's a great place.
[1968.32 --> 1968.68]  All right.
[1968.74 --> 1969.34]  So, oh, you know what?
[1969.36 --> 1972.46]  I guess we didn't actually do much Twitter blitzing here, so...
[1972.46 --> 1973.52]  Of course I requested.
[1973.70 --> 1975.00]  Will there ever be a GTX 790?
[1975.08 --> 1975.80]  We don't know.
[1978.04 --> 1978.56]  Um...
[1978.56 --> 1979.00]  Okay.
[1979.42 --> 1980.08]  What do you think?
[1981.04 --> 1981.44]  Ah!
[1981.74 --> 1982.70]  Hey, Kyle!
[1983.00 --> 1985.94]  I don't know if you've been paying much attention to Newegg's Black Friday deals, but it's going
[1985.94 --> 1987.18]  to be pretty embarrassing if you hadn't.
[1987.26 --> 1989.94]  What do you think was the best Newegg Black Friday deal so far?
[1989.94 --> 1990.38]  Oh.
[1991.38 --> 1992.64]  Oh, boy.
[1993.44 --> 1993.74]  Yep.
[1993.86 --> 1994.72]  Time to be embarrassing.
[1995.18 --> 1996.68]  There's some pretty good stuff going on in, too.
[1996.74 --> 2000.98]  Honestly, I looked through the deals, and I saw, like, a bunch of little things.
[2001.10 --> 2006.02]  Like, I wasn't really looking for straight-up PC hardware, because I recently built the system,
[2006.22 --> 2009.22]  and I don't need to spend any more money on that for the next few days.
[2009.88 --> 2013.22]  But I did see a kilowatt on sale for, like, 17 bucks.
[2013.60 --> 2014.30]  That's not a bad deal.
[2014.30 --> 2019.90]  Yeah, and I totally bought one, because they're usually $30, $40, and there were some other
[2019.90 --> 2022.24]  things, like a few toolkits that were just dirt cheap.
[2022.64 --> 2023.12]  Not sure.
[2023.32 --> 2026.92]  It remains to be seen the quality of them, how easily they'll break.
[2027.40 --> 2027.80]  Yeah.
[2027.80 --> 2032.56]  I bought the iFixit one, and considering the price, I was pretty disappointed with how
[2032.56 --> 2034.62]  it's just a rebranded Chinese toolkit.
[2035.30 --> 2035.58]  Right.
[2036.48 --> 2037.04]  So you never know.
[2037.04 --> 2037.58]  That's what I was afraid of.
[2038.48 --> 2040.78]  But I did see, we did have a pretty nice TV.
[2041.50 --> 2043.22]  Well, actually, I've heard mixed things about it.
[2043.24 --> 2044.58]  It's like a Chang Hong TV.
[2044.68 --> 2045.86]  I don't know if you guys have ever heard of that brand.
[2045.92 --> 2046.64]  It's like a Chinese company.
[2046.64 --> 2047.36]  No, we really haven't.
[2048.00 --> 2048.62]  I thought he was lying.
[2049.02 --> 2050.46]  Yeah, I thought you were joking.
[2050.70 --> 2051.82]  I thought he was making fun of Seiki.
[2052.12 --> 2052.84]  Yeah, I thought you were...
[2052.84 --> 2054.08]  I'm not being racist at all.
[2054.08 --> 2057.06]  I thought you were making fun of every Asian brand, because you can kind of get away with
[2057.06 --> 2057.44]  that, right?
[2058.96 --> 2061.12]  Only half the time, because I'm only half Asian.
[2061.24 --> 2061.72]  Ah, okay.
[2062.20 --> 2063.68]  The other half, I'm being racist.
[2063.76 --> 2064.62]  Is it like a dice roll?
[2065.72 --> 2069.18]  Is it like actual 50% random, or is it like specific things?
[2070.10 --> 2071.46]  It's like 50%.
[2071.46 --> 2073.58]  Well, okay, I'm a quarter Chinese, I'm a quarter Thai.
[2074.18 --> 2074.54]  Okay.
[2074.54 --> 2076.82]  And then half, like, just white.
[2077.14 --> 2078.90]  Just obscure whiteness.
[2079.44 --> 2080.78]  I love how that's a thing.
[2080.96 --> 2081.72]  Obscure whiteness.
[2082.28 --> 2083.00]  You're a white person?
[2083.06 --> 2083.70]  Yeah, what's your heritage?
[2083.70 --> 2084.60]  I don't know, Europe.
[2086.42 --> 2086.78]  Probably.
[2087.00 --> 2087.12]  I'm white.
[2087.22 --> 2087.90]  I don't have a heritage.
[2089.96 --> 2093.28]  You know what's funny, though, is in Europe, it's totally different, and it is a thing.
[2093.66 --> 2093.84]  Yeah.
[2093.90 --> 2098.40]  Whereas it's just North America, because we're this weird, like, melting pot of whatever
[2098.40 --> 2099.62]  culture it all came from.
[2099.66 --> 2103.94]  So we just, we make our own culture, and we have monster trucks and, you know, poutine.
[2105.22 --> 2106.86]  Monster trucks, poutine, and maple leaves.
[2106.92 --> 2107.54]  Yeah, exactly.
[2107.66 --> 2109.76]  It's like, yeah, that's a culture something.
[2110.00 --> 2110.60]  Something like...
[2110.60 --> 2111.08]  It's like, what are you?
[2111.10 --> 2111.60]  I'm Canadian.
[2111.68 --> 2112.12]  What's that mean?
[2112.12 --> 2112.68]  I don't know.
[2112.68 --> 2112.94]  I don't know.
[2113.70 --> 2116.26]  Half Union and half Confederate.
[2116.50 --> 2116.94]  I don't know.
[2118.66 --> 2122.30]  So you might say that you have frequent internal conflicts, then.
[2123.52 --> 2124.52]  Yes, all the time.
[2124.60 --> 2126.60]  But only 100 plus years ago.
[2128.56 --> 2130.04]  I'm an old soul, that way.
[2130.04 --> 2132.54]  All right.
[2133.84 --> 2136.04]  Minus, I haven't heard much about VDR4 for a while.
[2136.22 --> 2137.20]  It's coming later.
[2137.32 --> 2138.92]  I wouldn't hold out on a system upgrade, though.
[2139.04 --> 2139.28]  No.
[2140.38 --> 2140.58]  Oh.
[2140.58 --> 2142.32]  And at the beginning, it's not going to be very good anyways.
[2142.56 --> 2143.56]  So this is a topic.
[2144.04 --> 2147.18]  Kyle, I'm not sure if you'll have much to say about this, but I certainly do.
[2147.80 --> 2149.60]  OCZ filing for bankruptcy.
[2149.84 --> 2150.48]  Have you heard about this?
[2150.48 --> 2150.88]  I know.
[2151.08 --> 2151.82]  I heard about that.
[2152.08 --> 2152.78]  It's very sad.
[2153.00 --> 2153.72]  It's very sad.
[2153.72 --> 2157.76]  I have two Vertex 4s in my system right now, and I'm sad that I'm never going to see a
[2157.76 --> 2158.38]  Vertex 5.
[2159.76 --> 2161.56]  Are you going to create a shrine to them?
[2162.70 --> 2163.22]  I should.
[2163.42 --> 2166.00]  Or maybe I'll sell them on eBay when they're really rare and extinct.
[2166.00 --> 2168.46]  I doubt that will be a thing.
[2168.50 --> 2170.08]  Computer hardware doesn't really mean that much.
[2170.18 --> 2170.74]  Yeah, yeah.
[2170.80 --> 2171.76]  Unless it's like Apple.
[2172.66 --> 2173.06]  Apparently.
[2173.26 --> 2173.52]  Yeah.
[2173.68 --> 2174.16]  You're probably right.
[2174.24 --> 2180.02]  We even saw old Apple iPhone first gens going on eBay for like thousands of dollars.
[2180.78 --> 2181.02]  Wow.
[2181.14 --> 2181.28]  Yeah.
[2181.50 --> 2183.72]  Well, I don't know if they were selling, but they were listed.
[2185.50 --> 2186.70]  So that's a thing.
[2187.16 --> 2191.56]  So I'm going to weigh in on the whole OCZ filing for bankruptcy thing a little bit here.
[2191.92 --> 2194.92]  And guys, I worked with OCZ for a long time.
[2194.92 --> 2197.74]  This time I'm guys, the audience, not guys, you and the other one.
[2197.92 --> 2198.98]  See, that's why that's confusing.
[2199.06 --> 2199.38]  I know.
[2199.50 --> 2199.82]  I know.
[2200.22 --> 2202.08]  So I worked with OCZ for a long time.
[2202.24 --> 2205.04]  I used to be the product manager for OCZ.
[2205.14 --> 2207.72]  That's going back almost about four years now, I think.
[2208.06 --> 2210.90]  And there were a lot of warning signs here.
[2211.06 --> 2212.56]  There were a lot of warning signs.
[2212.64 --> 2216.92]  I mean, there was stuff going on like I buy inventory at this price.
[2216.92 --> 2222.34]  And then by the time, you know, I would work through all that inventory, not to say that
[2222.34 --> 2224.90]  they weren't selling well, you know, they were selling extremely well.
[2224.92 --> 2225.88]  For a long time.
[2226.24 --> 2231.08]  But like, they want you to take so much so that they could hit their quarter end and year
[2231.08 --> 2232.66]  end goals and all that, that you take it in.
[2232.70 --> 2236.34]  And by the time you're selling it, they're giving you instant rebates and stuff like that
[2236.34 --> 2243.36]  that are so high that you know that they lost money on just the cost of the flash chips alone.
[2243.86 --> 2246.74]  Never mind manufacturing and customer service and shipping.
[2246.94 --> 2251.40]  I mean, they would cover the shipping and management and all of these commissions for the salespeople.
[2251.40 --> 2256.30]  I mean, it all adds up to the point where the only way to keep it going was to keep selling
[2256.30 --> 2259.64]  more and more and more and more and more, more volume.
[2260.14 --> 2265.56]  And that was something that with the profit margins that they were promising to their shareholders,
[2265.56 --> 2266.40]  they couldn't do.
[2266.48 --> 2271.48]  Because as long as it was fine to take investor money and sell every drive at a loss to hit
[2271.48 --> 2274.24]  higher and higher volume targets, it was going to work.
[2274.24 --> 2279.66]  But when investors kind of went, hey, you know, you're burning through all this cash really fast.
[2279.74 --> 2281.28]  What exactly are you doing over there?
[2282.12 --> 2285.50]  Well, they were buying market share and that wasn't going to fly in the long term.
[2285.60 --> 2290.12]  So when it came time to try to make money on the drives, I think what they discovered was that
[2290.12 --> 2294.82]  their brand name and their brand strength really wasn't as strong as they had hoped that it would be.
[2294.92 --> 2301.08]  And that by that time, SSD had gone from being an enthusiast type product to being a commodity type product.
[2301.08 --> 2310.64]  It happened very quickly. In fact, I'd say in the time between Vertex 2 and onward, SSD went full commodity.
[2311.18 --> 2316.72]  And so trying to release a Vertex 4 and a Vector and trying to dress it up and gussy it up and put,
[2316.82 --> 2318.48]  you know, maybe they should put gold heat spreaders on it.
[2318.52 --> 2322.12]  They were the pioneers of putting gold heat spreaders on things to make them sell for more.
[2322.12 --> 2323.06]  I love those. They were awesome.
[2323.32 --> 2329.08]  But you just weren't able to do it anymore. And that, I think, ultimately caused their downfall.
[2329.08 --> 2332.14]  So Toshiba is looking at buying the assets, which is interesting.
[2332.26 --> 2335.70]  I had a lot of people comment on something. Must have been Twitter.
[2336.10 --> 2338.32]  Really? Toshiba? They're really small. No, they're not.
[2338.32 --> 2339.16]  No, they're not at all.
[2339.40 --> 2344.14]  Toshiba is a flash manufacturer. In fact, you know what's funny is I had someone make the same comment
[2344.14 --> 2346.60]  about SanDisk and Adata.
[2347.32 --> 2349.86]  About their, oh, well, they're really small SSD players.
[2350.28 --> 2352.94]  No, they're not. They are manufacturers.
[2353.32 --> 2354.56]  Which means they're huge.
[2354.56 --> 2358.22]  Which means that they actually make the drives that smaller companies rebrand.
[2358.44 --> 2359.80]  So don't worry. They're okay.
[2360.22 --> 2363.16]  So Toshiba is a step above a drive manufacturer.
[2363.30 --> 2365.64]  They actually manufacture NAND flash.
[2366.00 --> 2367.08]  So they're going to be all right.
[2367.52 --> 2368.92]  Do they make SSDs yet?
[2369.18 --> 2370.44]  I don't think they do.
[2370.52 --> 2373.92]  But if they acquired OCZ, then that would be very interesting.
[2374.06 --> 2376.84]  Because Indolinks' controller technology is not bad.
[2377.20 --> 2377.86]  It's good.
[2377.86 --> 2381.04]  And Toshiba Toggle NAND is among the best out there.
[2382.16 --> 2383.64]  So this could be a match made in heaven.
[2386.90 --> 2387.58]  I like it.
[2387.68 --> 2388.42]  Looks like it.
[2388.84 --> 2389.56]  On New Egg.
[2390.72 --> 2391.76]  Apparently they do have them.
[2392.46 --> 2393.12]  On New Egg.
[2393.22 --> 2394.70]  Oh, out of stock though.
[2394.82 --> 2395.22]  So I don't know.
[2395.34 --> 2398.10]  I don't think they've been doing anything for a while.
[2398.32 --> 2399.00]  I'm kind of assuming.
[2399.34 --> 2401.18]  Yeah, like is this SATA 2 or SATA 3 or what?
[2401.20 --> 2402.04]  No, this is SATA 3.
[2402.90 --> 2403.68]  So yeah, they've got one.
[2403.76 --> 2404.60]  The HDTS.
[2404.86 --> 2406.56]  They could use some branding on this.
[2406.56 --> 2409.70]  HDTS225XZSTA.
[2410.34 --> 2410.62]  Yeah.
[2411.16 --> 2412.08]  Oh God, yeah.
[2412.32 --> 2413.44]  Yeah, so they need some help.
[2413.46 --> 2414.42]  Sounds like a Lee and Lee product.
[2415.00 --> 2415.34]  Yeah.
[2415.90 --> 2418.48]  You know, Lee and Lee is this company that I just...
[2418.48 --> 2420.92]  I love their products and the quality is fantastic.
[2420.92 --> 2423.06]  But even I can't figure out their product line.
[2423.52 --> 2424.20]  I agree.
[2424.62 --> 2429.38]  I think they'd do so much better if they just had some better branding, marketing and whatnot.
[2429.56 --> 2433.68]  Yeah, even some coherency to the positioning of the products.
[2433.68 --> 2436.72]  Like you go on their site and it's just like, which case would you like?
[2436.78 --> 2437.42]  Here are all the cases.
[2438.70 --> 2439.06]  Yeah.
[2439.22 --> 2440.90]  And I'm like, well, I don't know.
[2441.04 --> 2441.74]  The, like...
[2441.74 --> 2442.16]  The train one.
[2442.28 --> 2443.08]  The gaming one.
[2443.50 --> 2443.82]  Like...
[2443.82 --> 2444.66]  The train one.
[2444.80 --> 2445.32]  The train one.
[2445.34 --> 2445.80]  It's the best.
[2445.90 --> 2447.70]  I even requested a train set.
[2447.70 --> 2450.04]  I tried to get one, but I couldn't.
[2450.50 --> 2452.50]  Well, more like you couldn't at a reasonable price.
[2452.70 --> 2452.96]  Yeah.
[2453.14 --> 2453.60]  Because they were...
[2453.60 --> 2454.38]  Man, they were expensive.
[2454.48 --> 2455.04]  Yeah, they were.
[2455.54 --> 2457.22]  You know what I actually had a while back?
[2457.90 --> 2459.10]  It was a swag item.
[2459.42 --> 2461.78]  It was a Lee and Lee dinosaur.
[2462.60 --> 2466.36]  So it was like a sheet of aluminum and then it had all the pieces and then you assembled
[2466.36 --> 2466.56]  it.
[2466.62 --> 2469.74]  Like, you know those dinosaurs that you like put the ribs on the back of the spine and
[2469.74 --> 2470.10]  like...
[2470.10 --> 2470.94]  Like you made a little...
[2470.94 --> 2472.78]  Lee and Lee aluminum dinosaur is awesome.
[2472.84 --> 2473.46]  That's so cool.
[2473.64 --> 2473.86]  Yeah.
[2474.24 --> 2474.68]  That's fun.
[2474.68 --> 2478.62]  I don't know what happened to it, but that was one of my favorite swag things that I ever
[2478.62 --> 2478.82]  got.
[2478.94 --> 2481.86]  Did they call it like a 95-608?
[2481.86 --> 2484.20]  And you're like, dude, it's a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
[2485.90 --> 2487.88]  No, but I'm sure they were tempted.
[2490.26 --> 2490.74]  All right.
[2490.78 --> 2491.46]  What do we got next?
[2493.60 --> 2494.00]  Okay.
[2494.08 --> 2496.86]  There's a 4K Ultrabook apparently that costs less than $1,400.
[2497.52 --> 2503.02]  I think more than anything, that's revealing of how inexpensive 4K displays actually are
[2503.02 --> 2506.44]  and how manufacturers need to just screw off and just give us our displays now.
[2506.58 --> 2508.84]  I wonder how well that Ultrabook's pushing that display though.
[2509.34 --> 2510.02]  Yeah, exactly.
[2510.02 --> 2511.96]  Kyle, how awesome is your sauce?
[2513.96 --> 2514.36]  Incredibly.
[2514.80 --> 2515.16]  Excellent.
[2516.04 --> 2516.44]  Incredulously.
[2517.08 --> 2517.88]  Incredulously awesome.
[2518.94 --> 2521.34]  Jeremy asks, how to work at Linus Tech or NCIX?
[2522.38 --> 2527.64]  Well, at Linus Tech we're not hiring, but at NCIX you could start with going to ncix.com
[2527.64 --> 2529.00]  slash careers, I think it is?
[2529.16 --> 2529.80]  Something like that.
[2529.88 --> 2530.44]  Something like that.
[2530.64 --> 2531.84]  If not, it's on the...
[2531.84 --> 2533.66]  If you scroll down to the bottom of their website, it should be there.
[2534.04 --> 2534.56]  I'll find it.
[2534.56 --> 2537.16]  Just spam their YouTube channel and pine for a job.
[2537.28 --> 2537.86]  They love that.
[2537.98 --> 2538.82]  It's a really good idea.
[2539.02 --> 2539.38]  Yeah.
[2540.02 --> 2541.00]  That works really well.
[2543.10 --> 2548.10]  How tempting is it to have all that crazy hardware around you working at Newegg?
[2548.10 --> 2550.76]  It's really tempting.
[2551.04 --> 2556.58]  And I feel like I get to purge some of that anxiety that I feel because I have my own YouTube channel.
[2557.14 --> 2561.38]  And so sometimes if we're backed up and we don't have time to look at a product at Newegg,
[2561.38 --> 2565.38]  I can take it home and research it by myself and shoot a video of it and whatnot.
[2565.38 --> 2570.00]  And it's also pretty cool because it lets me look at products more honestly.
[2570.74 --> 2572.70]  Whereas Newegg, we kind of sell everybody.
[2572.98 --> 2577.98]  We have to be fair to all the vendors and we can't really do reviews because if we give
[2577.98 --> 2579.86]  a bad review, then no one will buy the product, right?
[2580.16 --> 2580.78]  It's a company.
[2580.98 --> 2584.18]  So that's the cool thing about having my own channel is that I get to do what you guys
[2584.18 --> 2588.08]  do is be really honest with the products and let them know how you feel about it so
[2588.08 --> 2590.96]  that people can actually make a more valid purchasing decision.
[2590.96 --> 2596.76]  And Mango Deuce Dane asks, what is it like working with Paul?
[2598.04 --> 2599.60]  Working with Paul is pretty awesome.
[2600.30 --> 2603.92]  He's just like, he's exactly how you see him in the videos.
[2604.14 --> 2605.36]  I mean, he's not dressed up at all.
[2605.40 --> 2607.58]  He has no hyper extended personality.
[2608.26 --> 2609.54]  What are you implying exactly?
[2610.46 --> 2610.98]  What's that?
[2611.08 --> 2612.30]  I said, what are you implying exactly?
[2613.60 --> 2617.74]  That he's really laid back and relaxed.
[2617.74 --> 2621.88]  That some people do have fake personalities on camera, perhaps?
[2621.96 --> 2623.46]  Well, I mean, yeah, sometimes.
[2623.82 --> 2627.12]  Sometimes you do, you know, sometimes you see somebody on camera and you meet them in
[2627.12 --> 2628.92]  person and they're totally different.
[2629.56 --> 2630.74]  My old roommate was like that.
[2631.18 --> 2634.80]  But Paul is kind of like a no frills type guy.
[2634.86 --> 2635.88]  He just says how it is.
[2636.44 --> 2641.04]  And, you know, he's not trying to be in the spotlight or trying to be the face of Newegg.
[2641.10 --> 2643.80]  He really just wants to share information with people.
[2643.90 --> 2644.34]  Can we go back?
[2644.34 --> 2645.44]  He's like, he's a really good teacher.
[2645.44 --> 2647.06]  Can we go back to that old roommate for a second?
[2647.06 --> 2650.62]  So you said your roommate kind of put on airs when over video.
[2650.78 --> 2654.30]  So did you actually meet this roommate over like a like a webcam chat or?
[2655.34 --> 2659.24]  No, no, this is this is a roommate that I had in college, actually.
[2659.44 --> 2662.98]  And he college, you know, the stories about, you know, what happens between roommates in
[2662.98 --> 2663.24]  college.
[2663.36 --> 2663.84]  Please go on.
[2664.50 --> 2665.64]  Oh, you're not.
[2665.78 --> 2666.88]  OK, I don't know who that was.
[2668.88 --> 2670.40]  Speaking of college roommates.
[2670.40 --> 2678.46]  No, but he was the one that sparked my interest in you, I guess, and like what a YouTube partner
[2678.46 --> 2683.22]  could be because he was a YouTuber and, you know, he made all of these wacky.
[2683.58 --> 2687.32]  I guess they were kind of like tech videos, but he did more like consumer electronics stuff
[2687.32 --> 2691.26]  and movies and TV shows, reviews of that nature.
[2691.26 --> 2694.42]  But he would be just completely wacky all the time.
[2694.48 --> 2696.76]  And then you'd talk to him and he's like a really chill, mellow guy.
[2696.80 --> 2699.42]  And you put a camera on him and he just puts on this whole act.
[2699.96 --> 2700.12]  Right.
[2700.26 --> 2701.92]  And Paul's like the inverse of that.
[2702.36 --> 2708.72]  And I'm probably like somewhere in between being completely exaggerated and exactly the
[2708.72 --> 2711.74]  same as I am because I'm not interesting enough to just be myself on camera.
[2711.82 --> 2712.58]  No one would watch me.
[2712.70 --> 2713.84]  So I have to spice things up.
[2713.84 --> 2716.86]  So Paul's chill enough on on camera and he's sorry.
[2716.96 --> 2718.14]  So he's the inverse of the other guy.
[2718.20 --> 2721.94]  So basically he it's like he got hit with a horse tranquilizer when he's not on camera.
[2723.54 --> 2729.46]  I mean, he gets excited, you know, a new product comes in and like his eyebrows go up like a
[2729.46 --> 2730.20]  normal human being.
[2730.98 --> 2735.18]  But for the most part, he's just a really down to earth guy and he's super nice.
[2735.38 --> 2735.92]  He's lovable.
[2736.00 --> 2736.88]  He's like a big teddy bear.
[2736.98 --> 2738.14]  He's like the office teddy bear.
[2738.92 --> 2740.40]  Oh, all right.
[2740.40 --> 2741.26]  He gave bear hugs.
[2742.00 --> 2743.56]  Let's move into our last topic.
[2743.56 --> 2747.60]  Now, I know you haven't had much time for gaming lately, but how have you been?
[2747.70 --> 2751.08]  Have you been following much of the news about Steam OS and Steam boxes?
[2752.52 --> 2756.38]  Here and there, but I'm not I'm not completely versed in it yet.
[2756.50 --> 2756.80]  All right.
[2756.86 --> 2757.66]  So check this out.
[2757.96 --> 2759.56]  Top War Gamer posted on the forum.
[2759.80 --> 2762.54]  Here is I buy Power Steam Machine Prototype.
[2762.64 --> 2767.18]  Now, the funny thing about this is they sent an email to me earlier this week that was like,
[2767.54 --> 2769.62]  hush, hush, top secret, blah, blah, blah.
[2769.62 --> 2772.94]  We'll be showing off a Steam Machine Prototype at CES.
[2773.56 --> 2774.72]  And I'm like, okay.
[2775.08 --> 2776.32]  So I didn't say anything about it.
[2776.40 --> 2778.56]  And then like the next day, it's everywhere.
[2778.74 --> 2779.96]  And there's like pictures of it.
[2780.14 --> 2781.98]  And it's like on Engadget and The Verge.
[2782.02 --> 2782.88]  I'm just like, okay.
[2783.36 --> 2784.18]  Is it a secret?
[2784.28 --> 2784.92]  Is it not a secret?
[2785.02 --> 2785.40]  I don't get it.
[2785.40 --> 2786.52]  Anyway, to me, it looks like a Wii.
[2786.52 --> 2788.92]  You know what?
[2789.04 --> 2789.66]  It kind of looks...
[2789.66 --> 2790.58]  You're talking about the white one, right?
[2790.58 --> 2791.20]  With different colors?
[2791.50 --> 2791.74]  Yeah.
[2792.12 --> 2792.48]  Well, the white...
[2792.48 --> 2795.38]  It looks like a PlayStation 4 and an Xbox One had a baby.
[2795.50 --> 2797.78]  It does not look like a PS4.
[2797.96 --> 2799.64]  It looks like a PS4 got squished up straight.
[2799.76 --> 2800.88]  No, it does not.
[2801.12 --> 2801.70]  It's white.
[2801.70 --> 2802.46]  It's a Xbox One.
[2802.66 --> 2803.40]  Oh, what?
[2803.56 --> 2805.30]  The color is so easy to change.
[2805.98 --> 2806.92]  Color is easy to change?
[2807.00 --> 2807.98]  Tell Michael Jackson that.
[2807.98 --> 2811.50]  Good one.
[2812.68 --> 2814.10]  I think it is a PS4.
[2814.20 --> 2816.50]  They just put better components in it.
[2819.56 --> 2821.42]  They bought a whole bunch of PS4s.
[2821.48 --> 2822.82]  They're just like, yeah, no, don't worry about it.
[2822.84 --> 2823.24]  Yeah, whatever.
[2823.32 --> 2824.18]  That GPU sucks.
[2824.38 --> 2825.18]  You can take out the hard drive.
[2825.24 --> 2825.42]  Remember?
[2825.54 --> 2826.22]  No, we got this.
[2826.32 --> 2827.54]  Yeah, we're going to put a better one in.
[2827.56 --> 2828.08]  Don't worry about it.
[2828.10 --> 2828.44]  It's all good.
[2829.40 --> 2833.08]  I hear you can actually flash your PS4 to turn into a Steam box.
[2833.92 --> 2835.08]  That would be so epic, actually.
[2835.08 --> 2835.64]  That would be awesome.
[2835.64 --> 2838.50]  All right, so we have some known specs.
[2838.58 --> 2840.22]  It's going to have a multi-core AMD CPU.
[2840.38 --> 2846.90]  It looks like AMD is just firing on all freaking cylinders when it comes to design wins lately.
[2847.10 --> 2847.42]  That timing.
[2847.70 --> 2852.32]  Yeah, it'll have an R9 270 GPU, 500 gig hard drive, built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, an integrated
[2852.32 --> 2852.86]  power supply.
[2852.92 --> 2856.66]  It'll be a little bit bigger than a PS4, but still smaller than an Xbox One and comes with
[2856.66 --> 2857.84]  Valve's Steam controller.
[2858.12 --> 2861.38]  And all this is looking to come in around $500.
[2861.80 --> 2865.18]  It's cool that I buy power and knows that the X versions are not worth anything.
[2865.18 --> 2866.40]  Yeah, I know, right?
[2867.22 --> 2867.96]  X versions.
[2868.60 --> 2869.76]  Why do you exist?
[2869.82 --> 2870.74]  Why do you exist?
[2870.82 --> 2871.56]  You're not as good.
[2871.90 --> 2875.06]  All right, so why don't we do a couple more Twitter blitz questions and then I guess we'll
[2875.06 --> 2875.68]  have to let you go.
[2875.78 --> 2877.28]  We've had you actually more than half an hour.
[2877.38 --> 2878.02]  Sorry about that, Kyle.
[2878.66 --> 2879.80]  Oh, it's gone by so fast.
[2879.94 --> 2880.60]  You guys are great.
[2880.74 --> 2881.28]  Thank you.
[2881.48 --> 2881.74]  Aw.
[2882.54 --> 2884.70]  He's so nice to us and then he's self-deprecating.
[2884.88 --> 2885.38]  I know.
[2885.58 --> 2887.04]  How do you hate this guy?
[2887.10 --> 2888.24]  Because I certainly do hate him.
[2888.94 --> 2889.90]  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[2890.04 --> 2890.80]  He works for the enemy.
[2890.90 --> 2891.20]  I'll kill you.
[2891.20 --> 2893.42]  And you're not, okay, you don't work there anymore.
[2893.54 --> 2894.92]  That's been so confusing about this stream.
[2895.22 --> 2895.40]  Let it go.
[2895.48 --> 2896.94]  Why are you so rah-rah on NCIX?
[2896.94 --> 2898.88]  They are a competing YouTube channel too.
[2899.64 --> 2903.02]  And we still do work with the NCIX YouTube team very closely.
[2903.06 --> 2904.48]  But you don't work for them.
[2904.66 --> 2905.30]  You work with them.
[2905.56 --> 2909.84]  And he called me out on overclocking our graphics card benchmarks.
[2910.44 --> 2911.34]  He did it as well.
[2911.48 --> 2912.02]  Oh, no, he didn't.
[2912.12 --> 2913.18]  No, he did not.
[2913.26 --> 2914.94]  It was a friendly poke.
[2914.94 --> 2916.14]  A friendly poke?
[2916.54 --> 2918.74]  That is what I tell my wife.
[2919.00 --> 2920.08]  This was not a friendly poke.
[2920.20 --> 2920.52]  Sorry.
[2921.14 --> 2922.64]  I can't hold that together.
[2925.04 --> 2925.98]  Dear God.
[2926.44 --> 2927.18]  Are we still live?
[2927.44 --> 2928.02]  Yes, we are.
[2928.08 --> 2928.92]  Yes, we're still live.
[2928.98 --> 2929.84]  So why don't we move on?
[2930.54 --> 2935.90]  Kyle, do you have any thoughts on the Asus Mars 760, their dual GTX 760 card?
[2936.82 --> 2937.36]  Oh, God.
[2937.74 --> 2938.52]  That's pretty awesome.
[2938.64 --> 2939.82]  I haven't even heard much about it.
[2940.12 --> 2942.94]  But I think it's going to be cool and probably a little overpriced.
[2942.94 --> 2944.98]  But that doesn't mean it's any less badass.
[2945.98 --> 2946.52]  You know what?
[2947.02 --> 2949.42]  Asus should hire you to do their ROG marketing.
[2949.92 --> 2951.18]  Because that was pretty much it.
[2951.92 --> 2952.78]  It's going to be cool.
[2953.48 --> 2954.16]  It's going to be expensive.
[2955.24 --> 2956.54]  But it's going to be awesome.
[2956.68 --> 2957.46]  But it's going to be badass.
[2957.68 --> 2958.80]  It's like, yeah, there you go.
[2958.86 --> 2959.48]  There you go.
[2960.44 --> 2961.12]  I would, yeah.
[2961.74 --> 2962.48]  They owe me money.
[2966.16 --> 2966.78]  I don't know.
[2966.88 --> 2967.98]  What are your thoughts on it?
[2968.42 --> 2972.42]  I would rather get two separate cards or one freaking card.
[2972.42 --> 2973.42]  That's what I would rather do.
[2974.34 --> 2976.68]  Do you know if they're going to allow SLI?
[2977.46 --> 2977.74]  Yes.
[2978.12 --> 2979.44]  Quad SLI will be enabled.
[2979.62 --> 2981.08]  So that's a little bit unique.
[2981.94 --> 2982.70]  Yeah, that's really cool.
[2982.82 --> 2987.30]  I would still rather buy one 780 Ti or two 780 Ti's, though, personally.
[2987.32 --> 2987.44]  Sure.
[2988.06 --> 2988.28]  All right.
[2988.34 --> 2988.90]  So we've got...
[2988.90 --> 2989.70]  Is it going to...
[2989.70 --> 2990.02]  I'm sorry.
[2990.18 --> 2990.66]  Last question.
[2990.82 --> 2991.22]  Do you know...
[2991.22 --> 2992.18]  I'm just curious myself.
[2992.28 --> 2993.12]  Is it going to be on air?
[2993.26 --> 2995.00]  Or do they have like an integrated water cooler?
[2995.00 --> 2995.64]  It is air.
[2995.72 --> 3001.10]  It's not like the last generation Aries card that had that built-in liquid cooler.
[3001.10 --> 3001.76]  All right.
[3001.82 --> 3004.92]  So we've got some troll asking us a question on Twitter here.
[3005.76 --> 3008.26]  Which of New Egg's elf commercials do you like the best?
[3008.98 --> 3009.48]  Oh, God.
[3010.22 --> 3010.52]  Wait.
[3010.70 --> 3011.86]  Are those live yet?
[3012.00 --> 3012.72]  Are those already up?
[3013.52 --> 3014.44]  I don't know, man.
[3014.48 --> 3015.06]  You tell me.
[3015.14 --> 3018.42]  Because I think this guy is kind of trolling us pretty hard here.
[3018.48 --> 3020.36]  He's like sort of a jackass.
[3020.40 --> 3020.76]  I know him.
[3021.56 --> 3022.50]  Oh, is it Paul?
[3024.18 --> 3025.34]  I guarantee you it's Paul.
[3025.72 --> 3026.14]  Yeah, it's Paul.
[3026.14 --> 3028.30]  Honestly, I haven't even seen all the elf commercials.
[3028.44 --> 3029.36]  I've only seen two of them.
[3029.52 --> 3031.44]  One of which, all of our voices are altered.
[3031.70 --> 3037.02]  So me, Jenny, and Paul, we're all in a national commercial that's supposed to be broadcasted
[3037.02 --> 3038.20]  on TV like today.
[3038.34 --> 3038.74]  Really?
[3038.98 --> 3039.38]  Allegedly.
[3039.76 --> 3040.12]  Yes.
[3040.30 --> 3041.12]  That's awesome.
[3041.62 --> 3043.30]  I mean, they were so ambitious about it.
[3043.40 --> 3047.74]  This was last week and I think our CMO was like, hey, I want three national commercials.
[3047.90 --> 3048.92]  And we're like, oh yeah, that sounds great.
[3048.98 --> 3050.30]  He's like, bye next week.
[3051.16 --> 3052.12]  Like, what?
[3052.12 --> 3054.16]  But we did it.
[3054.20 --> 3054.66]  It happened.
[3055.32 --> 3058.68]  And they kind of like auto-tuned our voices to sound like elves.
[3058.90 --> 3059.74]  It's pretty awful.
[3059.96 --> 3064.22]  But I think that was only one of the versions they might actually turn around and if they
[3064.22 --> 3067.80]  listen to our requests, we'll use our real voices because they're much sexier.
[3070.46 --> 3070.86]  Wow.
[3070.96 --> 3072.12]  You're going to get a kick out of it.
[3072.12 --> 3077.96]  I am really excited to see this because honestly, and as much as, okay, I hope no one tells Logan
[3077.96 --> 3083.92]  this, but my favorite video of his that I've ever seen is his Tiger Direct commercial spot.
[3084.26 --> 3085.52]  Have you seen it?
[3085.94 --> 3086.42]  Yeah.
[3087.20 --> 3087.64]  Great.
[3087.64 --> 3093.66]  I'm going to see if I can dig this up because it is so amazing.
[3093.80 --> 3101.80]  Like the level of sellout going on here is just so far beyond like the real Logan that
[3101.80 --> 3102.70]  we, that we know and love.
[3102.74 --> 3102.88]  Okay.
[3103.00 --> 3105.58]  I don't know if you guys are going to have audio for this or not, but I'm going to go
[3105.58 --> 3106.88]  ahead and screen share with you here.
[3107.30 --> 3108.04]  So here we go.
[3108.08 --> 3108.46]  Here we go.
[3109.52 --> 3110.62]  Oh, oh, hold on.
[3111.20 --> 3111.76]  Hold on.
[3112.56 --> 3112.92]  Okay.
[3112.96 --> 3113.38]  Let's try again.
[3117.64 --> 3118.46]  Oh, this is classic.
[3143.78 --> 3144.42]  You know what?
[3144.46 --> 3145.50]  You know what it reminds me of?
[3145.50 --> 3148.54]  It's like those crazy commercials that you see late at night at like two in the morning.
[3148.66 --> 3151.24]  It's like, come down to crazy girls television sets.
[3151.28 --> 3152.80]  We got the hottest deals around town.
[3153.70 --> 3155.06]  Oh, I love that.
[3155.30 --> 3155.98]  I love that.
[3156.06 --> 3156.72]  Oh, Logan.
[3157.22 --> 3158.50]  Apparently there was no sound.
[3158.60 --> 3159.56]  I'm sorry, you guys.
[3159.64 --> 3161.14]  Nothing I can do about it right now.
[3161.24 --> 3164.26]  But the point is it's, it's ridiculous.
[3164.26 --> 3168.98]  If you search for current Tiger TV commercial spot or something like that, it comes up.
[3168.98 --> 3174.96]  But like that is going to be the most embarrassing video on the entire internet of, uh, of our,
[3175.08 --> 3177.74]  of our favorite, of our favorite buddy, Logan there.
[3178.04 --> 3180.92]  And you can see the pain behind his eyes the whole time.
[3181.02 --> 3182.64]  Like he knows what kind of commercial he's in.
[3182.68 --> 3184.84]  You can see the act of defiance.
[3185.08 --> 3192.48]  He's wearing his raise the world shirt under his sport coat to like be like, look, I, I,
[3192.66 --> 3194.34]  I, I didn't want to do this.
[3194.44 --> 3196.06]  I didn't want to do this, but they made me.
[3196.06 --> 3197.52]  I had to, but I didn't want to do this.
[3197.52 --> 3198.06]  It's like Superman.
[3198.20 --> 3198.80]  Like work there.
[3199.48 --> 3199.84]  Worked.
[3199.96 --> 3200.74]  But isn't that recent?
[3200.88 --> 3201.80]  No, no, that's old.
[3202.06 --> 3202.90]  Yeah, that's old.
[3202.98 --> 3203.38]  That's old.
[3203.88 --> 3205.02]  I thought that was new.
[3205.74 --> 3207.60]  Yeah, no, that was, uh, that was amazing.
[3207.88 --> 3208.26]  All right.
[3208.26 --> 3209.76]  So I think that's pretty much it.
[3209.84 --> 3211.52]  Thank you, Kyle, for joining us.
[3211.58 --> 3213.46]  We really appreciate having you on the show.
[3214.26 --> 3215.34]  Thanks for having me on guys.
[3215.34 --> 3215.94]  All right.
[3216.02 --> 3216.40]  Take care.
[3217.22 --> 3217.46]  You too.
[3218.62 --> 3222.20]  Let's jump directly into these two confusing topics.
[3223.06 --> 3223.74]  All right.
[3223.82 --> 3225.98]  Yeah, this is, uh, this is,
[3226.06 --> 3226.68]  this is kind of the thing.
[3226.68 --> 3227.78]  A whole whack load of weirdness.
[3227.96 --> 3228.32]  Yeah.
[3228.48 --> 3228.86]  All right.
[3228.92 --> 3232.88]  So this is actually from the NCIX forums of all places.
[3232.98 --> 3234.60]  We're going to go ahead and screen share with you guys here.
[3234.64 --> 3236.48]  It was posted by Bloody Lunatech.
[3237.02 --> 3239.02]  And the original article is from Tech Power Up.
[3239.02 --> 3244.18]  And the rumor is that NVIDIA is working on a GTX Titan refresh.
[3244.18 --> 3249.86]  But, like, it totally looks like someone just painted it.
[3250.02 --> 3251.24]  And I have some reasons for it.
[3251.26 --> 3252.40]  Don't those look like silver fins?
[3253.20 --> 3256.06]  No, those look like, those look like dark aluminum fins to me.
[3256.06 --> 3257.76]  Do they look like dark aluminum or shaded?
[3258.24 --> 3259.90]  No, I think they look like dark aluminum.
[3260.00 --> 3270.98]  And I think you'd have a hard time, um, changing the texture of the shroud here to make it, like, more, more dark than it, than it already was.
[3270.98 --> 3272.70]  Like, I don't know, man.
[3272.74 --> 3274.90]  You should see some of the pictures of people painted Titans.
[3275.44 --> 3276.90]  That's some pretty easy stuff to paint.
[3277.38 --> 3277.66]  Okay.
[3277.92 --> 3278.52]  Fair enough.
[3278.66 --> 3280.28]  Like, real easy stuff to paint.
[3280.36 --> 3280.80]  Okay, hold on.
[3280.84 --> 3281.10]  Let's go.
[3281.20 --> 3281.74]  But they, okay.
[3282.04 --> 3282.38]  Okay.
[3282.56 --> 3282.82]  Okay.
[3282.88 --> 3292.06]  When we've seen Photoshop cards in the past, though, no one, no one really seems to bother with, uh, doing, like, two chops of it.
[3292.24 --> 3295.56]  It's usually, like, one good Photoshop or something like that.
[3295.64 --> 3297.34]  And they've done two different images of it.
[3297.36 --> 3299.14]  No, I mean, people have actually painted Titan.
[3299.46 --> 3299.64]  Right.
[3299.64 --> 3300.42]  Oh, okay.
[3300.68 --> 3302.46]  So you think that this is just a painted Titan?
[3302.50 --> 3306.42]  I just, I don't understand why the hell they would release this.
[3306.76 --> 3308.56]  I mean, okay, here's, ugh.
[3308.62 --> 3310.00]  It has a few more coup de course.
[3310.62 --> 3317.98]  I guess if we weren't, if we didn't have 780 Ti 6GB cards coming, then this might make sense.
[3318.16 --> 3318.44]  Yeah.
[3318.44 --> 3324.08]  Because then Titan could still be positioned as the multi-way SLI 6GB monster.
[3324.08 --> 3329.62]  But with EVGA releasing that Kingpin Edition 780 Ti, um...
[3329.62 --> 3331.14]  It's like, why does this exist?
[3331.14 --> 3339.04]  We can tell you guys, like, okay, well, it would have slightly better performance with, you know, its full double precision floating point enabledness.
[3339.48 --> 3340.06]  But, like...
[3340.06 --> 3341.06]  But...
[3341.66 --> 3342.08]  I don't...
[3342.08 --> 3343.00]  It's very weird.
[3343.80 --> 3344.16]  Yeah.
[3344.24 --> 3345.92]  And it doesn't seem, like, I, I kinda...
[3346.64 --> 3347.54]  I get it.
[3347.56 --> 3351.00]  Okay, so if we had to gamble, are you and I gonna gamble not a real thing?
[3351.74 --> 3352.14]  Probably.
[3352.88 --> 3353.08]  Okay.
[3353.08 --> 3353.82]  But, like, it could be.
[3353.90 --> 3356.02]  I'm not saying it's not, but I just, like...
[3356.02 --> 3357.40]  I still don't recommend buying one.
[3357.90 --> 3358.26]  No.
[3358.40 --> 3359.48]  So, that's a thing.
[3359.58 --> 3361.26]  Because it's gonna be so much money.
[3361.48 --> 3361.72]  Yeah.
[3362.26 --> 3363.60]  780 Ti is, like...
[3363.60 --> 3364.18]  And Maxwell is, like, right there.
[3364.70 --> 3365.06]  Yeah.
[3365.42 --> 3370.92]  I've had quite a few people asking me, should I get a 700 series now, or should I wait until Maxwell?
[3370.92 --> 3377.00]  And the answer is, unfortunately, the same as it always is, guys, because we don't know.
[3377.10 --> 3377.64]  No idea.
[3377.64 --> 3382.14]  I mean, the thing about Maxwell is it should be on a new, a new process node.
[3382.68 --> 3387.58]  It should be at least a strong step forward in terms of performance.
[3387.82 --> 3393.88]  But with what NVIDIA's done in terms of pricing of new generation cards, with the exception of 680 Ti,
[3394.62 --> 3398.74]  they've just taken whatever's out there now, and they've taken their cards and gone,
[3398.86 --> 3401.58]  okay, well, this one performs about in between those two, so here's the pricing.
[3402.80 --> 3403.36]  So it wouldn't...
[3403.36 --> 3404.56]  This one performs better, so here's the pricing.
[3404.96 --> 3405.22]  Yeah.
[3405.22 --> 3405.90]  So it wouldn't...
[3405.90 --> 3407.22]  It's not, like, actually...
[3407.78 --> 3408.22]  I don't know.
[3408.32 --> 3408.84]  It doesn't...
[3408.84 --> 3409.60]  We can't really say.
[3409.70 --> 3410.24]  We could be wrong.
[3410.30 --> 3412.02]  They could 8800 GT the market again.
[3412.24 --> 3412.50]  Yeah.
[3413.10 --> 3413.70]  They probably won't.
[3413.84 --> 3415.06]  But I kind of doubt it.
[3415.12 --> 3421.58]  I think that their strength right now in terms of graphics card market share and graphics card perception
[3421.58 --> 3425.16]  is such that they don't need to do that, so...
[3425.16 --> 3426.56]  AMD's doing real good, though.
[3426.78 --> 3427.04]  Yeah.
[3427.04 --> 3428.00]  Especially with our 9 290s.
[3428.08 --> 3429.92]  Not 290Xs, but our 9 290s.
[3429.98 --> 3431.08]  290s is a strong-looking card.
[3431.12 --> 3432.76]  I gotta wonder how profitable it is for them, though.
[3432.76 --> 3444.04]  That is a bigger die than 7970, and it's selling at pricing that is pretty near what they were doing with 7950 back when that launched.
[3444.42 --> 3448.66]  And then you factor in the fact that it is a more expensive board to produce because it consumes more power,
[3448.86 --> 3452.12]  and it is a more expensive cooling solution because it kicks out more heat.
[3452.12 --> 3456.88]  And it's a newer design, so the yields aren't going to be as high.
[3456.98 --> 3460.84]  I really gotta wonder if what they're doing right now isn't just totally crazy town.
[3461.34 --> 3461.44]  Yeah.
[3461.92 --> 3464.44]  I mean, our 9 290, big thumbs up.
[3464.48 --> 3466.52]  In fact, we've got something exciting coming, you guys.
[3466.62 --> 3468.88]  Our water block for our 9 290 arrived.
[3469.16 --> 3475.76]  So we're going to be doing water-cooled our 9 290 versus GTX 780, because those are the closest priced cards that make the most sense.
[3475.76 --> 3482.26]  And we're going to get them both to the point where throttling goes away, and we find out what they're both truly capable of.
[3482.30 --> 3483.96]  So stay tuned for that on Linus Tech Tips.
[3484.08 --> 3484.88]  I'm actually pretty stoked.
[3485.04 --> 3489.20]  Yeah, I'm pretty excited about that, because up till now, I haven't even...
[3489.20 --> 3489.66]  People...
[3489.66 --> 3490.12]  It's funny.
[3490.18 --> 3494.08]  I get called an NVIDIA fanboy a lot, and I get called an AMD fanboy sometimes, too.
[3494.16 --> 3494.26]  It's fine.
[3494.52 --> 3497.34]  On our recent video, the...
[3497.34 --> 3499.28]  Can it just rotate depending on what card is released?
[3499.44 --> 3499.88]  Yeah, of course.
[3500.12 --> 3502.60]  If there's an AMD release where NVIDIA fanboys...
[3502.60 --> 3506.56]  I mean, if there's an AMD release where AMD fanboys, if there's an NVIDIA release where NVIDIA fanboys...
[3506.56 --> 3511.94]  So on our holiday buyer's guide, I had someone asking why I hated on AMD so hard.
[3512.40 --> 3514.12]  And I was like, okay, well, two things.
[3514.20 --> 3517.66]  Number one is that one out of our three systems had an AMD CPU in it.
[3517.86 --> 3521.86]  Number two is that two out of our three systems had AMD graphics cards in them.
[3521.86 --> 3527.18]  So out of six possible spots that I could have assigned to AMD, they got three.
[3528.80 --> 3530.28]  So, yeah.
[3530.66 --> 3532.50]  In, like, the three most logical spots.
[3532.60 --> 3532.96]  Yes.
[3533.06 --> 3534.22]  Because I booked over everything.
[3534.48 --> 3534.82]  Yes.
[3535.04 --> 3537.42]  So we both agreed on those parts lists.
[3537.56 --> 3537.74]  Yeah.
[3537.74 --> 3544.18]  So if I'm an NVIDIA fanboy, then so is he, and so is anyone who looks at things objectively,
[3544.30 --> 3544.58]  I guess.
[3545.36 --> 3545.78]  All right.
[3545.90 --> 3549.08]  So moving on to our next topic, that is...
[3549.08 --> 3551.18]  Like, what the heck was this one even about?
[3551.26 --> 3552.48]  I can't even find it right now.
[3553.34 --> 3554.58]  The Black Titan?
[3554.82 --> 3555.72]  No, no, the other one.
[3555.76 --> 3556.46]  We already talked about that.
[3556.50 --> 3558.04]  Power Color Releases Crazy Fan Design.
[3558.12 --> 3559.06]  It's right under the Black Titan.
[3559.18 --> 3559.96]  Yeah, there it is.
[3560.04 --> 3560.50]  Okay, so...
[3560.50 --> 3561.72]  This thing is ridiculous.
[3561.72 --> 3563.74]  What the heck are they doing?
[3564.10 --> 3569.40]  So it was posted by BrownNinja97 on the forum, and it looks perfectly normal.
[3569.74 --> 3570.04]  Okay.
[3570.24 --> 3571.02]  Until you, like...
[3571.02 --> 3571.54]  There's a box.
[3571.62 --> 3572.00]  Hold on.
[3572.08 --> 3572.44]  Hold on.
[3572.50 --> 3572.74]  Hold on.
[3572.80 --> 3573.34]  There's a box.
[3573.44 --> 3573.98]  That's normal.
[3574.26 --> 3574.48]  Yeah.
[3574.48 --> 3576.10]  It supports 4K, which is normal.
[3576.44 --> 3578.20]  It's got two fans, which are normal.
[3578.28 --> 3578.66]  Oh!
[3580.18 --> 3581.16]  What the heck?
[3581.32 --> 3583.66]  What the heck is going on here?
[3584.38 --> 3585.82]  So we got five big...
[3585.82 --> 3591.60]  Okay, so first of all, it looks like instead of being a downdraft cooler towards the heatsink,
[3591.76 --> 3594.50]  it is sucking air from the heatsink.
[3594.62 --> 3595.02]  Okay?
[3595.24 --> 3597.96]  So there's a couple of advantages and disadvantages to this.
[3598.04 --> 3602.24]  So advantage number one is that this implementation can be quieter, is my understanding.
[3602.64 --> 3605.84]  Although you're going to have to have a reasonable shroud on it and stuff like that.
[3605.96 --> 3606.46]  Blah, blah, blah.
[3606.56 --> 3607.12]  Less turbulence.
[3608.12 --> 3610.12]  But disadvantage...
[3610.72 --> 3611.52]  Whatever.
[3611.72 --> 3613.64]  I think that's about the only advantage I can come up with.
[3613.82 --> 3617.76]  I guess another advantage would be that it doesn't exhaust air down towards the PCI
[3617.76 --> 3620.40]  Express lot on the motherboard, so your motherboard might not run as hot.
[3620.90 --> 3624.86]  So it's going to be pulling air from around it and then blowing it down towards your other
[3624.86 --> 3625.60]  add-in card.
[3625.72 --> 3626.02]  Yeah.
[3626.34 --> 3627.74]  Like, okay, none of this...
[3627.74 --> 3628.82]  That's not necessarily an advantage.
[3628.82 --> 3629.06]  Okay.
[3629.20 --> 3630.98]  Well, why don't I just say...
[3630.98 --> 3632.20]  Imagine your raid card was there.
[3634.40 --> 3634.92]  Overheat.
[3635.20 --> 3635.42]  Okay.
[3635.90 --> 3636.34]  So...
[3636.34 --> 3640.52]  Okay, the other weird thing about it, aside from the fact that it pulls air through the
[3640.52 --> 3641.10]  fins...
[3641.10 --> 3641.36]  Oh, right.
[3641.42 --> 3647.00]  So the disadvantage of pulling air through the fins is that you can't control the directionality
[3647.00 --> 3647.70]  of the airflow as much.
[3647.72 --> 3651.04]  It's going to come in from around the edges where it doesn't actually have to come through
[3651.04 --> 3652.88]  the fins unless they've sealed it extremely well.
[3653.32 --> 3656.06]  In which case, they might as well just turn the fan around because it's the same thing.
[3656.28 --> 3660.12]  So then number two weird thing about it is look at these little baby...
[3660.12 --> 3661.38]  Baby blades right here.
[3661.56 --> 3665.12]  I thought they were like reflections at first and I was like, nope, nope, nope.
[3665.12 --> 3665.76]  Those are things.
[3665.76 --> 3666.00]  Nope.
[3666.06 --> 3667.50]  Those are definitely things.
[3668.10 --> 3670.14]  So I will be interested...
[3670.14 --> 3672.56]  I don't think we have a power color contact, but this is funny.
[3672.64 --> 3673.86]  This is about the OPs.
[3674.10 --> 3674.42]  Like, yeah.
[3674.62 --> 3677.66]  It kind of reminds me of like Nemo...
[3677.66 --> 3679.94]  Finding Nemo little fins on like clownfish.
[3680.78 --> 3685.34]  So yeah, I guess we'll reserve judgment on this one for now.
[3685.34 --> 3691.16]  There's also some feature that makes it spin at like basically max fan speed when you turn
[3691.16 --> 3691.80]  your computer off.
[3692.02 --> 3694.52]  I am so tired of seeing that feature.
[3694.64 --> 3696.00]  It doesn't do anything.
[3696.76 --> 3698.18]  It's going to cool down.
[3698.18 --> 3703.30]  I had an unboxing I did that someone complained I didn't mention that feature because it keeps
[3703.30 --> 3705.98]  the fan spinning after your system powers down.
[3706.48 --> 3706.86]  Blah, blah, blah.
[3706.92 --> 3707.66]  Increases longevity.
[3707.78 --> 3710.88]  Actually, it's been proven that it does nothing for longevity.
[3711.18 --> 3711.90]  It's proven.
[3712.14 --> 3712.82]  It's done.
[3712.96 --> 3713.86]  It's put to rest.
[3714.06 --> 3717.88]  We've taken that book, closed it and put it away on the shelf and then burn the shelf.
[3717.98 --> 3718.40]  It's done.
[3718.64 --> 3719.90]  It doesn't do anything.
[3720.28 --> 3720.38]  No.
[3720.38 --> 3723.66]  All it does is make your system loud when you turn it off.
[3724.00 --> 3724.16]  Yep.
[3725.76 --> 3726.24]  Hooray!
[3726.76 --> 3729.50]  Because 100% fan speed is like real loud.
[3729.52 --> 3730.46]  Real loud.
[3731.54 --> 3734.12]  It doesn't usually go that fast, I can tell you that much.
[3734.40 --> 3734.78]  All right.
[3734.86 --> 3737.70]  So we actually had a couple Razer things this week.
[3737.76 --> 3744.52]  So number one was we had the Razer Kraken Forged headphones that we just released our unboxing
[3744.52 --> 3744.84]  of.
[3744.84 --> 3749.84]  And number two is that Razer did a press release about their evil genius branded...
[3750.38 --> 3752.32]  eSports gaming products.
[3755.28 --> 3758.86]  I'm going to let you take this one because if you saw my notes on this, I have no idea
[3758.86 --> 3759.90]  why this is a big deal.
[3760.26 --> 3760.66]  Me either.
[3761.38 --> 3762.08]  Why are people...
[3762.08 --> 3762.60]  Okay, good.
[3763.00 --> 3763.54]  Thank you.
[3763.70 --> 3764.74]  Why are people freaking out?
[3764.98 --> 3766.94]  Well, color schemes are a thing.
[3769.18 --> 3771.54]  People are freaking out in negative ways though.
[3771.58 --> 3772.08]  They're freaking...
[3772.08 --> 3773.74]  Well, they shouldn't because it doesn't matter.
[3773.86 --> 3774.58]  It's just another box.
[3774.58 --> 3775.80]  This is happening so much.
[3775.94 --> 3776.58]  I mean...
[3776.58 --> 3777.24]  For everything.
[3777.54 --> 3779.20]  Here, I probably have Steel...
[3779.20 --> 3781.34]  Yeah, there's a SteelSeries 7H Fanatic Edition right there.
[3781.34 --> 3782.08]  That's my point.
[3782.40 --> 3783.98]  SteelSeries has been doing it forever and no one cares.
[3783.98 --> 3786.64]  We have a Team Navi headset up there.
[3786.68 --> 3786.94]  They're blue.
[3787.26 --> 3787.80]  They're yellow.
[3788.24 --> 3789.24]  Well, no, there's a blue one.
[3789.40 --> 3790.24]  There's also a blue one.
[3790.26 --> 3791.34]  There's a blue one for...
[3791.34 --> 3792.62]  No, no, that's just a special edition.
[3792.68 --> 3793.90]  It's not an eSports team.
[3794.26 --> 3798.76]  Like, this whole sponsored thing is like, are you going to phone up Nike and be like,
[3798.76 --> 3800.22]  yo, Air Jordan shoes.
[3800.30 --> 3801.12]  That's not cool, man.
[3801.16 --> 3802.36]  Don't do like sponsored shoes.
[3802.90 --> 3803.74]  I don't know.
[3803.86 --> 3807.72]  I mean, I don't think it's a big deal in terms of like, I don't care.
[3807.92 --> 3808.92]  They look good though.
[3809.12 --> 3812.60]  If an eSports team, you know, puts their branding on a peripheral, I don't care.
[3812.64 --> 3813.36]  I'm not going to buy it.
[3813.40 --> 3814.94]  I'm also not going to be upset about it.
[3815.00 --> 3815.74]  Yeah, I just...
[3815.74 --> 3821.84]  I mean, something to understand about this, guys, is that sports teams rely on sponsorship.
[3822.10 --> 3824.50]  eSports teams, sports teams, they rely on sponsorship.
[3825.02 --> 3830.30]  And while, frankly, a lot of the time, I mean, it's no secret that there are eSports players
[3830.30 --> 3835.56]  out there that wear the branded headset that their sponsor put on their head and then have
[3835.56 --> 3840.70]  like IEMs running underneath them and like just like put the cables kind of down their
[3840.70 --> 3840.98]  shirts.
[3841.16 --> 3844.02]  Like, it is what it is.
[3844.02 --> 3850.66]  If you want to buy real gear, don't buy things based on what someone uses on camera.
[3851.22 --> 3856.18]  Buy things based on, you know, what they use off camera or buy things based on what you
[3856.18 --> 3859.90]  can actually try and you can actually find out works really well for yourself.
[3860.22 --> 3865.94]  You shouldn't make purchase decisions based on just, well, you know, Joe from whatever
[3865.94 --> 3866.68]  said that it was great.
[3866.74 --> 3868.20]  Now, there are exceptions to this.
[3868.80 --> 3873.56]  TTE Sports has a couple of mice that I actually feel pretty strongly are quite cool.
[3873.56 --> 3876.68]  I forget what they're called now, but there's one, there's the white raw one.
[3877.06 --> 3878.82]  Because they actually have a lot of input on it?
[3878.92 --> 3882.34]  Yeah, because I put my hand on the mouse and I went, oh, it's made for a big Russian dude.
[3883.30 --> 3883.46]  Yeah.
[3883.46 --> 3886.44]  I was like, I can't use this because I'm not a big Russian dude.
[3886.94 --> 3888.52]  Where that made a lot of sense to me.
[3888.56 --> 3891.74]  But rebranding existing products, if you don't feel strongly about the color scheme.
[3892.20 --> 3893.18]  You were thinking white raw.
[3893.26 --> 3893.42]  Yeah.
[3893.54 --> 3894.20]  Did I say white raw?
[3894.20 --> 3894.84]  Sephira.
[3895.02 --> 3895.92]  Yeah, Sephira's the mouse.
[3896.32 --> 3896.56]  Okay.
[3896.68 --> 3898.08]  Yeah, the white raw Sephira mouse.
[3898.16 --> 3898.30]  Yeah.
[3898.82 --> 3903.02]  So, I mean, if you're just rebranding an existing product, if you think the color scheme's great,
[3903.08 --> 3903.60]  then go for it.
[3904.24 --> 3908.24]  If you think Team Evil Genius is great and you want them to get a small commission on the
[3908.24 --> 3909.90]  sponsorship, go for it.
[3909.96 --> 3915.52]  It's a great way to support someone that you feel strongly deserves the support.
[3915.78 --> 3917.78]  That's, I think, all there really is to it.
[3917.84 --> 3918.58]  It's uncomplicated.
[3918.76 --> 3919.98]  Yeah, they look really nice.
[3920.06 --> 3920.88]  Yeah, they look really good.
[3920.88 --> 3922.44]  The color scheme is really sharp.
[3922.52 --> 3922.68]  Yeah.
[3922.82 --> 3924.38]  Like, it looks really good.
[3924.48 --> 3926.76]  I actually really like the color scheme on that keyboard.
[3926.96 --> 3927.16]  Yep.
[3927.32 --> 3928.46]  The keyboard looks amazing.
[3928.62 --> 3931.74]  Too bad it's not Cherry MX.
[3932.10 --> 3935.60]  Yeah, no, I'm not into the keyboard, but I like the, it looks good.
[3935.72 --> 3936.48]  Yeah, looks great.
[3936.56 --> 3940.36]  And if you like the switches that happen to be on it, then that's, like, great.
[3940.80 --> 3942.62]  You know, the design of the mouse pad looks nice.
[3942.62 --> 3946.50]  And mouse pads are one of those things where it's just like, okay, whatever, it's a mouse pad.
[3947.46 --> 3948.28]  There's differences.
[3948.38 --> 3949.02]  There are differences.
[3949.02 --> 3951.48]  I personally really prefer QCKs.
[3951.52 --> 3952.54]  I won't use anything else.
[3952.64 --> 3954.48]  So, I guess I shouldn't say it's just a mouse pad.
[3954.98 --> 3956.82]  But if you don't already have a specific...
[3956.82 --> 3957.82]  It's just a mouse pad.
[3957.90 --> 3959.48]  I will only use this one.
[3959.70 --> 3962.76]  If you have a specific mouse...
[3962.76 --> 3965.80]  If you don't already have a specific mouse pad that you really, really like, then it's
[3965.80 --> 3966.66]  worth a shot.
[3966.76 --> 3968.20]  Because I don't think it comes at a huge premium.
[3969.70 --> 3970.58]  I'd rather...
[3970.58 --> 3971.10]  Okay, here.
[3971.20 --> 3971.68]  How about this?
[3971.90 --> 3974.76]  I would rather buy a peripheral that's branded around...
[3974.76 --> 3975.26]  You know what, guys?
[3975.30 --> 3976.16]  Hit us up on Twitter.
[3976.16 --> 3980.22]  Tell us what you think about sponsored branded peripherals.
[3980.30 --> 3980.90]  We'd love to hear it.
[3980.90 --> 3981.74]  Because there's tons.
[3982.16 --> 3984.46]  There's ones for, like, Modern Warfare 3.
[3984.80 --> 3986.54]  Logitech did a Modern Warfare 3 thing.
[3987.20 --> 3989.38]  There's ones for actual gamers.
[3989.98 --> 3990.92]  There's ones for...
[3990.92 --> 3991.72]  I think that's about it.
[3991.90 --> 3993.56]  But I was going to try and come up with at least...
[3993.56 --> 3996.26]  Well, there's gaming groups and there's individual gamers.
[3996.36 --> 3996.80]  That's true.
[3997.00 --> 3997.20]  Yeah.
[3997.20 --> 3998.62]  So, whole teams...
[3998.62 --> 4002.52]  I mean, the thing about particularly the whole team branded ones is I kind of look at those
[4002.52 --> 4005.86]  and I raise an eyebrow because there's no such thing as two gamers even on the same team.
[4005.94 --> 4007.42]  They're going to be like, yeah, I want exactly like that one.
[4007.72 --> 4008.16]  You know what?
[4008.42 --> 4009.70]  And another thing to actually...
[4009.70 --> 4015.26]  Along the lines of gamers who wear IEMs under their sponsored headphones, there are...
[4015.26 --> 4017.52]  The rumors are abundant that Yonix...
[4017.52 --> 4020.22]  So, if you don't follow badminton, you might not have any idea what Yonix is.
[4020.22 --> 4030.32]  But that Yonix actually makes special rackets for their sponsored players that have the paint job of whatever the current high-end thing they're pushing is,
[4030.44 --> 4032.52]  but are actually the racket that that player likes.
[4035.98 --> 4036.78]  That's pretty funny.
[4036.84 --> 4037.36]  It makes sense.
[4037.62 --> 4039.06]  It makes sense.
[4039.16 --> 4043.86]  You're not going to cripple your professional players that you sponsor by giving them something that they don't like,
[4043.88 --> 4044.98]  even if it's a great product.
[4044.98 --> 4047.72]  There are great products that I just don't like.
[4049.26 --> 4049.98]  So...
[4049.98 --> 4050.50]  It's preference.
[4050.66 --> 4052.56]  And I'm not even going to be as picky as a pro gamer.
[4052.72 --> 4055.82]  The one thing that kind of ticks me off all the time is stuff like this.
[4056.14 --> 4062.24]  Giving the formidable pro gamers at Evil Geniuses the fastest, smoothest glide to get the last hit on enemies effectively.
[4062.52 --> 4063.72]  It's like, shut up.
[4064.32 --> 4066.30]  The last hit on enemies effectively.
[4066.48 --> 4072.76]  Yeah, because the smoothest possible glide in your mouse pad is going to give you an actual noticeable advantage over some dude with a cardboard.
[4073.16 --> 4073.46]  No.
[4073.92 --> 4074.76]  Like, come on.
[4074.98 --> 4076.54]  You're last hitting things in League.
[4076.68 --> 4077.80]  Like, or Dota.
[4078.12 --> 4078.44]  Whatever.
[4079.04 --> 4080.96]  Like, jeez.
[4081.28 --> 4083.56]  But you've got to look at who it's marketed to.
[4083.62 --> 4088.90]  I mean, I really feel like there's this divide between gamers and hardware enthusiasts.
[4088.90 --> 4093.00]  Where gamers, I feel like, get lied to a lot.
[4093.32 --> 4095.56]  And I feel like they're vulnerable to that.
[4095.64 --> 4095.84]  Yeah.
[4095.96 --> 4098.48]  Whereas hardware enthusiasts spend all their...
[4098.48 --> 4099.50]  Like, this is what I used to do.
[4099.52 --> 4108.46]  I spend all my friggin' time reading up about, you know, the bloody sensors in the mice and the micro, you know, laser reflections on the various surfaces.
[4108.46 --> 4110.60]  To the point where I actually have no time for gaming.
[4110.60 --> 4116.40]  And that's really where I feel like there is room for someone to bridge the gap there a little bit.
[4116.46 --> 4118.66]  Maybe we should probably try a little bit harder to do that.
[4119.16 --> 4124.46]  Where we take some of these products and try and talk about sort of reading between the lines of the product marketing.
[4124.46 --> 4129.02]  Because, quite frankly, that mouse and that mouse pad probably provides an excellent gaming experience.
[4129.46 --> 4131.00]  I haven't used them yet.
[4131.98 --> 4134.50]  But I don't think there's going to be anything wrong with them.
[4135.30 --> 4140.02]  I can't find it, but someone in the chat can probably say the quote.
[4140.22 --> 4141.70]  But there's one of the...
[4141.70 --> 4143.18]  Jadong is one of the guys on EG.
[4143.54 --> 4145.28]  And he has a review of...
[4145.28 --> 4146.78]  I think it was their mouse mat.
[4147.38 --> 4148.38]  And if someone...
[4148.38 --> 4150.20]  No, I don't want to click on something during the stream.
[4150.20 --> 4151.56]  But, um...
[4151.56 --> 4152.98]  And, like, the one guy's like,
[4153.02 --> 4156.36]  Oh, yeah, it makes my performance better in this gaming thing.
[4156.54 --> 4159.50]  Like, stupid, regurgitated crap.
[4159.80 --> 4161.18]  And then there's Jadong's review.
[4161.28 --> 4161.76]  And it's like,
[4162.10 --> 4166.10]  Well, it wasn't as soft and supple as 10,000 fangirls.
[4166.34 --> 4167.50]  But I think it was acceptable.
[4167.68 --> 4168.04]  And I was like,
[4168.10 --> 4168.52]  Yes!
[4168.80 --> 4169.62]  There you go!
[4169.70 --> 4170.62]  See, that's cool!
[4170.72 --> 4171.54]  And it was funny.
[4171.70 --> 4172.26]  And he's like,
[4172.34 --> 4174.72]  Yeah, I'm sponsored to say this, but here's something funny.
[4175.22 --> 4175.48]  Yeah.
[4175.56 --> 4177.10]  And then the other dude's like...
[4177.10 --> 4179.64]  Here's something actually realistic
[4179.64 --> 4180.68]  that I don't mind saying.
[4181.00 --> 4181.24]  Yeah.
[4181.66 --> 4182.58]  Alright, here we go.
[4182.70 --> 4183.18]  Mark says,
[4183.24 --> 4184.84]  I don't care where and if it's sponsored.
[4185.02 --> 4187.44]  If I want to buy it, I'm going to try it.
[4188.08 --> 4188.96]  I don't care for them.
[4189.10 --> 4190.50]  Less stupid logos is better.
[4190.70 --> 4191.82]  It's funny you mention that
[4191.82 --> 4194.24]  because it's not like...
[4194.24 --> 4195.52]  It's not going to have a logo on it.
[4195.76 --> 4197.26]  It just might have an Evil Genius logo
[4197.26 --> 4198.24]  instead of a Razor logo.
[4198.62 --> 4199.38]  Just food for thought.
[4199.44 --> 4200.84]  I'm not disagreeing with you necessarily.
[4201.68 --> 4202.84]  Usually they're not that good
[4202.84 --> 4204.82]  and just cost more for the sake of costing more.
[4205.50 --> 4207.10]  A lot of the times they're rebrands of other products.
[4207.28 --> 4208.98]  It's whether or not you think that product's good.
[4208.98 --> 4210.60]  Although sometimes they do
[4210.60 --> 4212.30]  like add in five or ten bucks to it.
[4212.30 --> 4212.42]  Sometimes.
[4212.74 --> 4214.94]  Because I was talking to a manufacturer
[4214.94 --> 4217.56]  about potentially doing a co-branded Linus Tech Tips product
[4217.56 --> 4219.76]  and they figured by the time
[4219.76 --> 4221.94]  there's packaging
[4221.94 --> 4224.28]  and color changes
[4224.28 --> 4225.80]  and whatever, whatever, whatever,
[4225.80 --> 4227.14]  if I even said
[4227.14 --> 4229.54]  I wanted a dollar commission on each one,
[4229.68 --> 4231.22]  that would add about four dollars
[4231.22 --> 4232.18]  to the end user price.
[4233.48 --> 4236.08]  Because the retailer's going to want additional markup,
[4236.24 --> 4237.58]  blah, blah, blah, this and that.
[4237.58 --> 4239.34]  And I was like, oh, all right then.
[4239.70 --> 4240.30]  That's good to know.
[4243.16 --> 4245.04]  Sponsorship related products are useful sometimes
[4245.04 --> 4245.92]  for different color schemes.
[4246.00 --> 4247.38]  However, I don't like the price premium.
[4247.84 --> 4249.46]  I think sponsor branded peripherals are cool.
[4249.54 --> 4250.60]  I like them, but they're pointless.
[4250.84 --> 4251.42]  Buy what you want.
[4252.32 --> 4253.22]  And that's where I stand.
[4253.64 --> 4255.54]  Companies can't sell their product with actual quality.
[4255.60 --> 4256.28]  I'm not going to buy it.
[4256.28 --> 4256.82]  That's interesting.
[4256.96 --> 4260.52]  So you prefer a company to focus on their own brand
[4260.52 --> 4262.00]  and sell it that way.
[4262.00 --> 4263.12]  But a lot of times they do
[4263.12 --> 4264.12]  because it's just the...
[4264.12 --> 4264.66]  Yeah, it's still raising.
[4264.76 --> 4265.78]  Like that 7H.
[4266.16 --> 4267.28]  It's a 7H.
[4267.44 --> 4267.62]  Yes.
[4267.62 --> 4269.00]  It's just the Fanatic Edition
[4269.00 --> 4270.04]  which has yellow accents.
[4270.24 --> 4270.58]  It's still a 7H though.
[4270.58 --> 4271.18]  It looks awesome.
[4271.64 --> 4273.76]  Yeah, but they're selling you a 7H.
[4273.86 --> 4274.06]  Yes.
[4274.20 --> 4275.54]  You're buying a different version
[4275.54 --> 4277.32]  which is like colorized.
[4277.38 --> 4278.36]  So they're still selling you
[4278.36 --> 4279.38]  the quality of the brand.
[4279.46 --> 4280.76]  Lots of love for the idea
[4280.76 --> 4282.00]  of better color schemes
[4282.00 --> 4283.30]  and supporting your favorite teams.
[4284.30 --> 4284.76]  Someone says,
[4284.76 --> 4286.22]  please lick Slick's ear for me.
[4286.26 --> 4286.90]  Not on camera.
[4288.14 --> 4289.86]  I buy keyboards for feel and look.
[4290.14 --> 4291.70]  Looks good and goes to a team I like.
[4291.76 --> 4292.38]  Then that's great.
[4292.68 --> 4293.78]  I have the Fanatic 7H
[4293.78 --> 4294.60]  but I hate Fanatic.
[4294.74 --> 4295.16]  All right then.
[4295.48 --> 4296.86]  But the color scheme on that headset
[4296.86 --> 4297.52]  is outstanding.
[4297.62 --> 4298.08]  Isn't it, Tyler?
[4298.80 --> 4299.46]  I think it's a good way
[4299.46 --> 4300.68]  to support your favorite teams
[4300.68 --> 4301.98]  even though, okay,
[4302.12 --> 4303.36]  Matteo feels that the quality
[4303.36 --> 4304.36]  isn't as good as other products.
[4304.42 --> 4305.62]  And that is an interesting point
[4305.62 --> 4306.90]  because it's going to be difficult
[4306.90 --> 4309.82]  with, again, that cost adder
[4309.82 --> 4312.10]  that a sponsorship adds to the product.
[4312.10 --> 4312.48]  Oh, you're spending more.
[4312.86 --> 4313.10]  Yeah.
[4313.10 --> 4314.64]  So it's going to be hard
[4314.64 --> 4315.74]  to take a top tier product
[4315.74 --> 4317.30]  like a $160 keyboard
[4317.30 --> 4319.68]  and then work in a reasonable amount
[4319.68 --> 4320.16]  of the margin
[4320.16 --> 4321.46]  to give to the eSports team
[4321.46 --> 4322.62]  and have it not become
[4322.62 --> 4324.24]  a $200 keyboard all of a sudden
[4324.24 --> 4325.02]  and then it's like,
[4325.10 --> 4325.58]  okay, well,
[4326.14 --> 4326.82]  now who's going to buy it?
[4326.84 --> 4327.56]  But then at the same time,
[4327.68 --> 4328.06]  like, okay,
[4328.16 --> 4329.16]  if I was going out
[4329.16 --> 4330.54]  and buying a,
[4330.64 --> 4332.04]  if I was buying, say,
[4332.12 --> 4332.56]  a keyboard
[4332.56 --> 4333.72]  and I knew exactly
[4333.72 --> 4334.54]  what keyboard I wanted
[4334.54 --> 4335.40]  and there was a
[4335.40 --> 4337.00]  $5 or $10 more variant
[4337.00 --> 4338.82]  that had, say,
[4339.20 --> 4340.32]  EG on it
[4340.32 --> 4342.12]  and it was colorized like that,
[4342.12 --> 4343.50]  I'd probably go for it.
[4343.76 --> 4344.74]  One, I like Team EG.
[4344.94 --> 4346.10]  We have over 6,000 viewers.
[4346.22 --> 4346.92]  I think that's a new record.
[4347.06 --> 4347.94]  That is actually really cool.
[4348.04 --> 4348.26]  Thank you.
[4348.30 --> 4349.54]  One, I really like Team EG.
[4350.00 --> 4350.86]  I like a lot of the guys
[4350.86 --> 4351.18]  on the team.
[4351.26 --> 4352.48]  In Control's really cool.
[4353.98 --> 4354.84]  Jadong's really cool.
[4354.94 --> 4355.48]  Huck's really cool.
[4355.58 --> 4356.90]  Like, I like a lot of the guys
[4356.90 --> 4357.20]  on the team
[4357.20 --> 4358.32]  and it looked so cool.
[4358.68 --> 4358.90]  Yep.
[4359.30 --> 4360.70]  I would pay enough
[4360.70 --> 4362.08]  for just the recolorization
[4362.08 --> 4362.62]  in itself.
[4362.98 --> 4364.12]  So Christian says,
[4364.12 --> 4364.78]  the way I see it,
[4364.86 --> 4366.10]  if a big notorious company
[4366.10 --> 4366.92]  like Audio Technica
[4366.92 --> 4368.06]  started sponsoring themselves,
[4368.20 --> 4368.98]  then I'd be more skeptical.
[4368.98 --> 4371.22]  I'm afraid I don't quite understand.
[4371.90 --> 4372.94]  John Port says
[4372.94 --> 4374.94]  he bought an OCZ Fatality Series
[4374.94 --> 4375.38]  power supply,
[4375.46 --> 4376.18]  but I think it's the same
[4376.18 --> 4376.64]  as the original
[4376.64 --> 4377.32]  except with a sticker.
[4377.52 --> 4377.72]  Yes.
[4378.00 --> 4379.16]  And a red LED light.
[4379.32 --> 4380.24]  That's the point though.
[4380.36 --> 4380.54]  Yeah.
[4381.14 --> 4382.32]  The red LED's cool.
[4382.58 --> 4383.66]  Doesn't it also come with sleeving?
[4383.78 --> 4384.62]  Does it normally come with sleeving?
[4384.62 --> 4385.42]  That's the Fatality 1000.
[4385.72 --> 4386.14]  Oh, okay.
[4386.14 --> 4386.62]  Only the 1000
[4386.62 --> 4387.68]  of individual sleeving.
[4387.74 --> 4388.46]  That was the first one
[4388.46 --> 4389.38]  to do individual sleeving,
[4389.38 --> 4390.10]  speaking of OCZ
[4390.10 --> 4390.70]  going out of business.
[4391.48 --> 4392.40]  I always thought
[4392.40 --> 4393.06]  pro gamers
[4393.06 --> 4393.68]  wearing earphones
[4393.68 --> 4394.20]  under their headset
[4394.20 --> 4395.46]  was purely for isolation.
[4395.46 --> 4397.56]  You can get headphones
[4397.56 --> 4398.66]  that isolate pretty well.
[4400.68 --> 4401.42]  That's a thing.
[4401.60 --> 4401.82]  Yeah.
[4402.06 --> 4402.70]  Yeah, that's like
[4402.70 --> 4404.18]  Bose QuietComfort 35.
[4404.44 --> 4405.06]  Hey, Brandon!
[4406.64 --> 4407.70]  Those are really good.
[4407.70 --> 4408.82]  What headphones do you have?
[4411.36 --> 4412.00]  QC15s rather.
[4412.14 --> 4412.32]  Sorry.
[4412.64 --> 4413.50]  Like, you put them on
[4413.50 --> 4413.98]  and you're just like,
[4414.04 --> 4414.78]  where'd everybody go?
[4415.06 --> 4416.30]  Yeah, it's kind of crazy.
[4416.64 --> 4417.60]  I'll like yell at them
[4417.60 --> 4418.12]  from the door
[4418.12 --> 4418.90]  and you can't hear me.
[4419.12 --> 4419.66]  Well, that's probably
[4419.66 --> 4420.54]  just ignoring you.
[4420.76 --> 4422.12]  No, he doesn't ignore me.
[4422.46 --> 4423.08]  He ignores me.
[4423.52 --> 4424.40]  I don't mind that.
[4424.40 --> 4425.72]  Hey, all the
[4425.72 --> 4427.16]  every Fnatic edition
[4427.16 --> 4427.50]  7-
[4427.50 --> 4428.00]  Oh, I think that's
[4428.00 --> 4428.44]  the same guy.
[4429.44 --> 4430.26]  I thought everyone
[4430.26 --> 4431.52]  who owned a 7-H Fnatic
[4431.52 --> 4432.06]  in the world
[4432.06 --> 4433.12]  was watching our stream.
[4433.54 --> 4434.58]  Hey, I like Fnatic too.
[4434.66 --> 4435.28]  They're really cool.
[4435.34 --> 4435.94]  Yeah, Tiger Woods.
[4436.16 --> 4437.06]  Counter-Strike for the win.
[4437.38 --> 4438.30]  I don't mind them personally,
[4438.46 --> 4439.08]  but I won't buy them
[4439.08 --> 4439.70]  at full price.
[4439.78 --> 4440.56]  Actually, that's funny
[4440.56 --> 4441.24]  you should mention that
[4441.24 --> 4441.94]  because Logitech
[4441.94 --> 4442.66]  always clears out
[4442.66 --> 4443.38]  the Modern Warfare
[4443.38 --> 4444.22]  branded peripherals
[4444.22 --> 4445.04]  for super cheap.
[4445.26 --> 4445.46]  Yeah.
[4445.48 --> 4446.76]  You could get G9Xs
[4446.76 --> 4448.04]  for like 29 bucks.
[4448.58 --> 4450.48]  Man, that's a great mouse.
[4450.62 --> 4451.26]  I wish I'd bought
[4451.26 --> 4452.26]  like a half a dozen of them.
[4452.38 --> 4453.94]  You can wrap them too,
[4453.94 --> 4454.62]  vinyl wrap them.
[4455.18 --> 4455.86]  I've seen people
[4455.86 --> 4457.00]  vinyl wrap G9Xs.
[4457.06 --> 4457.74]  It looks really cool.
[4457.86 --> 4458.22]  Awesome.
[4458.38 --> 4459.78]  If you don't like
[4459.78 --> 4460.26]  Modern Warfare,
[4460.40 --> 4460.90]  you can still buy
[4460.90 --> 4461.90]  a cheap Modern Warfare
[4461.90 --> 4462.46]  peripheral and
[4462.46 --> 4463.04]  vinyl wrap it.
[4463.16 --> 4463.74]  It's fine.
[4464.04 --> 4464.44]  All right, I'm going
[4464.44 --> 4465.32]  to let you take this one.
[4465.42 --> 4466.42]  Star Citizen cracks
[4466.42 --> 4470.54]  32 million is the name
[4470.54 --> 4471.10]  of a thread,
[4471.28 --> 4472.08]  and then it was
[4472.08 --> 4473.88]  31 million dollars
[4473.88 --> 4474.76]  the day before.
[4475.26 --> 4477.32]  And the original poster,
[4477.54 --> 4478.42]  Askew, is saying,
[4478.52 --> 4479.26]  I don't understand
[4479.26 --> 4479.94]  why this game
[4479.94 --> 4480.88]  has raised so much cash.
[4481.68 --> 4482.42]  It's ship reselling.
[4482.44 --> 4482.74]  Go for it.
[4482.74 --> 4484.06]  It's ship reselling 100%.
[4484.06 --> 4485.58]  So for a while there,
[4485.66 --> 4486.98]  and why this burst happened,
[4487.12 --> 4487.70]  I'll get into
[4487.70 --> 4488.76]  why the burst happened,
[4488.86 --> 4489.52]  because if you look
[4489.52 --> 4490.00]  at the trending,
[4490.12 --> 4491.24]  it's already trending down
[4491.24 --> 4493.06]  in a second.
[4493.24 --> 4494.42]  But why they're actually
[4494.42 --> 4495.24]  making so much money
[4495.24 --> 4496.02]  is they're selling
[4496.02 --> 4497.16]  large components
[4497.16 --> 4498.32]  in the game already.
[4498.86 --> 4499.88]  And the problem
[4499.88 --> 4500.52]  I have with this
[4500.52 --> 4501.22]  is that we cannot
[4501.22 --> 4502.64]  fly in the game yet.
[4502.72 --> 4503.34]  We cannot feel
[4503.34 --> 4504.02]  flight mechanics
[4504.02 --> 4504.86]  in any way
[4504.86 --> 4505.84]  of all these different ships,
[4505.92 --> 4506.58]  yet they're selling
[4506.58 --> 4507.52]  tons of them,
[4507.58 --> 4508.26]  and they're hyping it
[4508.26 --> 4508.82]  like crazy.
[4508.82 --> 4509.56]  And one thing
[4509.56 --> 4510.26]  that bugs me too
[4510.26 --> 4511.42]  is they're hitting milestones,
[4512.00 --> 4513.70]  and these multi-million dollar
[4513.70 --> 4514.54]  milestones are like,
[4514.62 --> 4515.30]  look, more ships
[4515.30 --> 4516.38]  that you can buy right now.
[4517.48 --> 4518.16]  So they're getting
[4518.16 --> 4518.88]  more money,
[4519.04 --> 4519.94]  which is kind of
[4519.94 --> 4520.40]  bugging me,
[4520.50 --> 4521.26]  and they shut down
[4521.26 --> 4522.32]  the LTI system,
[4522.40 --> 4523.36]  which is Lifetime Insurance
[4523.36 --> 4523.76]  system,
[4523.92 --> 4524.60]  which a lot of the
[4524.60 --> 4525.76]  Kickstarter backers got,
[4525.86 --> 4526.88]  and I think if you backed
[4526.88 --> 4528.16]  early enough
[4528.16 --> 4529.42]  after the Kickstarter thing,
[4529.52 --> 4530.36]  I think you might have
[4530.36 --> 4531.02]  been able to get it too.
[4531.08 --> 4531.54]  I'm not sure.
[4531.66 --> 4532.08]  Let's probably explain
[4532.08 --> 4533.12]  what Lifetime Insurance is.
[4533.32 --> 4534.24]  Lifetime, well...
[4534.24 --> 4535.08]  You can't lose your ship.
[4535.56 --> 4536.62]  You can't lose the hull.
[4536.82 --> 4537.00]  Yeah.
[4537.32 --> 4538.58]  You can lose the weapons
[4538.58 --> 4538.82]  on it and stuff.
[4538.82 --> 4539.30]  Weapons and cargo
[4539.30 --> 4539.74]  and whatnot.
[4539.88 --> 4540.06]  Yeah.
[4540.48 --> 4541.46]  But you can't lose the hull,
[4541.52 --> 4543.00]  so you can fix it back up again,
[4543.06 --> 4543.78]  which is really nice.
[4544.10 --> 4545.22]  So they got rid of that,
[4545.26 --> 4545.98]  but they got rid of that
[4545.98 --> 4546.86]  before you're able
[4546.86 --> 4547.92]  to fly the ships yet.
[4548.42 --> 4548.62]  Yeah.
[4548.62 --> 4549.76]  You're not able to fly the ships
[4549.76 --> 4550.56]  or try them out yet.
[4550.66 --> 4551.24]  Which I'm okay with.
[4551.26 --> 4551.88]  I don't want everyone
[4551.88 --> 4552.54]  having insurance.
[4552.70 --> 4553.62]  I want there to be like...
[4553.62 --> 4554.50]  When I'm one of the
[4554.50 --> 4555.66]  lead Kickstarter backers,
[4555.66 --> 4555.94]  I want to...
[4555.94 --> 4556.60]  You can't get it anymore.
[4556.74 --> 4557.10]  Yeah, I know.
[4557.16 --> 4558.08]  You can't buy in
[4558.08 --> 4559.38]  to be able to have it anymore.
[4559.86 --> 4561.10]  But no,
[4561.18 --> 4561.84]  that's been like that
[4561.84 --> 4562.22]  for a while.
[4562.26 --> 4562.46]  I know.
[4562.62 --> 4563.48]  Old accounts have been able
[4563.48 --> 4564.34]  to buy ships that had it.
[4564.36 --> 4565.68]  So if people want to like...
[4565.68 --> 4566.72]  If people want to,
[4566.80 --> 4567.16]  you know,
[4567.44 --> 4568.72]  buy a bunch of ships
[4568.72 --> 4569.50]  or whatever
[4569.50 --> 4570.68]  and I can blow them up later,
[4570.78 --> 4572.12]  then whatever.
[4572.66 --> 4573.64]  But then they'll be on LTI,
[4573.84 --> 4574.70]  so it doesn't really matter.
[4574.76 --> 4575.04]  No, no.
[4575.10 --> 4576.40]  The ones that are buying now won't.
[4576.42 --> 4576.80]  Oh, yeah.
[4576.86 --> 4577.88]  That's what my point is though.
[4577.96 --> 4579.30]  That is why there was the surge.
[4579.54 --> 4579.72]  Yeah.
[4579.72 --> 4580.56]  They took it away.
[4581.04 --> 4582.58]  So right before they took it away,
[4582.58 --> 4583.08]  everyone went,
[4583.28 --> 4584.62]  but buy all the stuff.
[4584.78 --> 4586.00]  So there was this like,
[4586.12 --> 4586.84]  oh my God, milestone.
[4587.00 --> 4588.12]  Oh my God, another milestone
[4588.12 --> 4589.02]  immediately afterwards
[4589.02 --> 4589.86]  because of that.
[4589.98 --> 4591.16]  I'm still excited about the game.
[4591.56 --> 4591.88]  Me too.
[4591.88 --> 4593.32]  Although we're getting pretty close
[4593.32 --> 4595.58]  to we should have combat soon
[4595.58 --> 4596.80]  and we'll see if it happens.
[4596.80 --> 4599.02]  I wish they dropped LTI
[4599.02 --> 4601.54]  like even a week after dog fighting
[4601.54 --> 4602.68]  because I've been,
[4602.80 --> 4603.78]  I put a little bit of money in
[4603.78 --> 4605.58]  and I've been really careful since then
[4605.58 --> 4607.02]  because it's always like,
[4607.08 --> 4607.84]  there's such a draw.
[4607.98 --> 4608.44]  Like, oh my God,
[4608.48 --> 4609.34]  that ship looks so cool.
[4609.40 --> 4610.24]  There's all this cool stuff.
[4610.24 --> 4610.74]  But then it's like,
[4611.18 --> 4614.32]  my ship might already be good enough for me
[4614.32 --> 4616.68]  once I make some modifications to it.
[4616.74 --> 4617.94]  And since I'm just going to be parking it
[4617.94 --> 4619.40]  in the back of Linus's ship anyway,
[4619.80 --> 4621.08]  while we fly around together,
[4621.08 --> 4621.88]  you know,
[4622.22 --> 4623.12]  exploring the universe.
[4624.56 --> 4625.46]  Yeah, basically.
[4625.78 --> 4625.92]  Yeah.
[4625.96 --> 4627.14]  So like, I just,
[4627.44 --> 4628.28]  it's going to be awesome.
[4628.42 --> 4629.92]  I wish I could fly the ship.
[4630.22 --> 4630.50]  Yeah.
[4630.60 --> 4630.86]  That's it.
[4631.04 --> 4632.42]  I'm really waiting for dog fighting.
[4632.70 --> 4635.24]  I think Star Citizen is still,
[4635.34 --> 4636.66]  like 32 million sounds like a lot.
[4637.06 --> 4638.62]  GTA 5 costs what?
[4638.68 --> 4639.92]  Like 500 million dollars to make?
[4641.60 --> 4641.94]  I don't,
[4642.00 --> 4643.02]  I think it was 50,
[4643.30 --> 4643.94]  not 500.
[4644.22 --> 4644.30]  Was it 50?
[4644.78 --> 4646.46]  GTA 5 budget.
[4646.80 --> 4647.64]  Maybe it was 500.
[4648.34 --> 4648.82]  Hold on.
[4648.96 --> 4649.76]  Budget, budget, budget.
[4650.08 --> 4650.98]  Biggest budget ever.
[4651.26 --> 4652.20]  Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[4652.68 --> 4654.42]  Someone says cost more than an American city.
[4655.36 --> 4655.92]  Here we go.
[4657.04 --> 4658.24]  265 million.
[4658.28 --> 4658.52]  Okay.
[4658.64 --> 4658.96]  So yeah,
[4659.22 --> 4660.64]  GTA 5 costs 265 million.
[4660.72 --> 4661.34]  They have 32.
[4661.70 --> 4661.96]  Yeah.
[4662.06 --> 4664.00]  And this game is supposed to be way bigger in scale.
[4664.14 --> 4664.28]  So,
[4664.40 --> 4665.44]  so it's a lot of money.
[4665.68 --> 4665.86]  Yeah.
[4665.86 --> 4667.52]  But it's still not an insane amount of money.
[4667.76 --> 4668.36]  So when you consider,
[4668.70 --> 4669.90]  when you consider other things.
[4669.90 --> 4671.42]  So I'm a little bit worried,
[4671.74 --> 4674.72]  but I think dog fighting can either completely make or break it.
[4674.96 --> 4675.92]  And Chris seems like a cool guy.
[4676.56 --> 4676.74]  Well,
[4676.78 --> 4677.50]  he's so dedicated.
[4677.76 --> 4677.94]  Yeah.
[4678.04 --> 4679.12]  That's why I'm not that worried.
[4679.14 --> 4680.74]  I had the opportunity to meet him personally,
[4680.90 --> 4682.44]  which is kind of cool because most,
[4682.48 --> 4682.60]  yeah,
[4682.66 --> 4682.90]  I know.
[4684.70 --> 4685.66]  Because most,
[4685.72 --> 4689.40]  most Kickstarter projects you find just like,
[4689.58 --> 4690.44]  it's a guess.
[4690.50 --> 4692.40]  You don't know the integrity of the person that you're.
[4692.40 --> 4692.56]  Like,
[4692.60 --> 4694.30]  I'm pretty sure Star Citizen is going to be fine,
[4694.30 --> 4694.92]  but I'm still,
[4695.02 --> 4697.94]  I'm still kind of staying away from it a little bit until I can fly around.
[4698.08 --> 4700.44]  And then I know that the second I can fly around and it's awesome,
[4700.60 --> 4701.10]  I'm going to be like,
[4701.14 --> 4701.90]  Oh my God.
[4702.58 --> 4703.58]  I'm so excited.
[4703.62 --> 4704.48]  I'm so stoked.
[4704.68 --> 4705.14]  But I've just,
[4705.24 --> 4706.98]  I've been trying to stay away from it a little bit.
[4707.02 --> 4708.90]  Speaking of Kickstarter and flying around.
[4709.08 --> 4709.30]  Oh,
[4709.38 --> 4709.96]  brilliant segue.
[4710.08 --> 4710.44]  Amazing.
[4710.62 --> 4712.32]  MGS star posted on the forum,
[4712.56 --> 4716.82]  this amazing video about a Kickstarter campaign that I had to fund.
[4717.18 --> 4718.04]  Look at this thing.
[4718.36 --> 4721.36]  It is a smartphone controlled paper airplane.
[4721.36 --> 4724.28]  So it's a battery and propeller that goes on,
[4724.30 --> 4729.14]  to the back of a paper airplane that allows you to fly it around with a Bluetooth smart enabled smartphone or tablet.
[4729.26 --> 4729.96]  So right now,
[4730.32 --> 4731.92]  or actually not right now because they have,
[4732.00 --> 4734.16]  they have busted the Android,
[4734.24 --> 4734.82]  uh,
[4734.94 --> 4735.40]  stretch goal.
[4735.82 --> 4738.32]  So at the beginning it was iPhone only,
[4738.42 --> 4739.54]  but I just kind of went for it.
[4739.56 --> 4739.86]  I was like,
[4739.88 --> 4740.00]  yeah,
[4740.00 --> 4740.24]  whatever.
[4740.30 --> 4742.42]  This is going to destroy the stretch target.
[4742.52 --> 4742.98]  So I'll be,
[4743.20 --> 4744.92]  I'll be flying this around on my Android phone.
[4744.96 --> 4745.34]  No problem.
[4745.44 --> 4745.62]  Yeah.
[4745.74 --> 4747.16]  But we just got an iPad mini anyway,
[4747.28 --> 4749.96]  so you'll be able to fly it or we'll be able to fly it and try it out.
[4750.28 --> 4750.60]  But,
[4750.70 --> 4750.90]  uh,
[4750.90 --> 4752.08]  I hope they show it a little bit,
[4752.18 --> 4752.50]  uh,
[4752.84 --> 4753.36]  later on.
[4753.44 --> 4755.04]  On the Kickstarter page it shows it.
[4755.12 --> 4755.40]  No,
[4755.56 --> 4755.86]  they,
[4755.86 --> 4756.88]  they show it later in the video,
[4756.96 --> 4757.20]  I think.
[4757.30 --> 4757.56]  Hold on.
[4757.62 --> 4757.82]  We'll just,
[4757.94 --> 4758.64]  we'll let it keep flying.
[4758.80 --> 4760.48]  But it goes for about 10 minutes apparently,
[4760.66 --> 4761.56]  and they're going to be shipping them,
[4761.66 --> 4763.24]  I think in March or April next year.
[4763.28 --> 4766.28]  It's not that expensive when you consider what an RC aircraft costs.
[4766.36 --> 4767.02]  It's just a 30,
[4767.12 --> 4768.14]  like it's really not that bad.
[4768.14 --> 4769.74]  And there's not much to break about it,
[4769.76 --> 4770.44]  which is really cool.
[4770.52 --> 4772.64]  So the propeller is actually at the back of the plane,
[4772.80 --> 4775.34]  which means that if you go down nose first into something,
[4775.50 --> 4778.88]  it's a lot less likely to cause a serious problems for you.
[4779.06 --> 4780.48]  Although it's not crash proof.
[4780.72 --> 4781.08]  No.
[4781.44 --> 4782.42]  As they play it.
[4782.42 --> 4782.66]  Oh,
[4782.74 --> 4783.30]  look at it go.
[4783.94 --> 4784.58]  So awesome.
[4784.66 --> 4786.18]  It's cool how he slows it down when it comes close.
[4786.26 --> 4787.58]  I know.
[4788.06 --> 4788.66]  I love it.
[4789.22 --> 4791.06]  So the original article was from,
[4791.06 --> 4791.48]  uh,
[4791.64 --> 4793.56]  tech power up or tweak town rather tweak town,
[4793.64 --> 4793.96]  tweak town.
[4794.04 --> 4795.28]  I'm going to make sure we give credit where credit's due.
[4795.34 --> 4795.88]  So there it is.
[4796.00 --> 4797.72]  So you guys can see there's the,
[4797.78 --> 4797.96]  uh,
[4797.96 --> 4798.46]  the receiver.
[4798.70 --> 4801.24]  So the transmitter will obviously be your phone or tablet.
[4801.56 --> 4802.76]  Here are the electronics.
[4802.76 --> 4804.56]  And then there's just a simple,
[4804.56 --> 4805.84]  um,
[4806.74 --> 4807.12]  piece,
[4807.48 --> 4808.34]  whatever this is called.
[4808.34 --> 4813.48]  It goes back to a motor and a rudder and a propeller.
[4814.50 --> 4815.66]  It's pretty simple.
[4815.80 --> 4816.66]  Looks ballin'.
[4816.66 --> 4817.24]  I love it.
[4818.10 --> 4821.40]  4,400 backers with 56 days to go.
[4821.48 --> 4822.36]  It just went up.
[4823.56 --> 4824.04]  Amazing.
[4824.06 --> 4826.46]  I love how they like crushed their goal.
[4826.72 --> 4826.94]  I,
[4826.96 --> 4827.24]  I,
[4827.24 --> 4829.34]  I backed that so fast.
[4830.20 --> 4831.94]  I actually had no idea you backed it.
[4831.98 --> 4832.46]  That's kind of cool.
[4832.60 --> 4832.76]  Yeah.
[4832.78 --> 4833.50]  As soon as I saw it,
[4833.50 --> 4833.76]  I was like,
[4833.78 --> 4833.98]  oh yeah,
[4834.06 --> 4834.16]  well,
[4834.24 --> 4835.00]  I'm pretty stoked.
[4835.12 --> 4835.94]  I love RC crap.
[4836.22 --> 4836.40]  Yeah,
[4836.52 --> 4836.86]  I know.
[4837.08 --> 4838.62]  So cheap RC crap.
[4838.70 --> 4839.58]  That's difficult to break.
[4839.58 --> 4842.70]  It's cool because a lot of the times what's going to get damaged.
[4842.70 --> 4843.60]  It's like the wings and stuff.
[4843.66 --> 4843.84]  It's like,
[4843.92 --> 4844.08]  dude,
[4844.14 --> 4844.94]  it's a paper airplane.
[4845.48 --> 4846.42]  Let's make another one.
[4846.60 --> 4846.80]  Yeah,
[4846.80 --> 4847.10]  exactly.
[4847.62 --> 4848.10]  Who cares?
[4848.22 --> 4851.62]  It's like you show up at the park with like a bunch of spare batteries and like a bunch
[4851.62 --> 4852.02]  of paper.
[4852.40 --> 4853.38]  No way.
[4854.38 --> 4854.70]  Oh,
[4854.78 --> 4855.10]  come on.
[4855.10 --> 4856.34]  I don't know if that really counts.
[4858.56 --> 4859.46]  They could have been.
[4859.60 --> 4859.84]  Okay,
[4859.90 --> 4860.26]  here we go.
[4860.32 --> 4860.58]  Here we go.
[4860.64 --> 4860.84]  Okay,
[4860.92 --> 4861.38]  so guys,
[4862.26 --> 4863.74]  Black Friday deals are cool,
[4863.98 --> 4867.04]  but it's not worth people dying over or getting hurt.
[4867.24 --> 4872.36]  So there's actually a site called Black Friday Death Count and it's actually,
[4872.36 --> 4875.68]  it's being updated for Black Friday right now.
[4876.06 --> 4878.16]  And it seems to be getting worse.
[4878.72 --> 4878.82]  Yeah.
[4878.94 --> 4881.26]  So they record all of the injuries and deaths.
[4881.44 --> 4881.78]  So there was,
[4881.88 --> 4883.64]  I actually remember the Toys R Us shooting.
[4883.78 --> 4885.62]  I remember hearing about that back in 2008.
[4886.24 --> 4889.84]  Target shoppers step over Walter Vance as he collapses and dies.
[4889.92 --> 4890.50]  I remember that.
[4890.60 --> 4893.08]  20 people injured and I think it was,
[4893.08 --> 4894.08]  no,
[4894.16 --> 4894.24]  no,
[4894.26 --> 4896.42]  it was 10 people injured in a stampede back,
[4896.52 --> 4897.32]  or four people rather.
[4897.50 --> 4897.68]  10,
[4897.78 --> 4897.98]  10,
[4898.34 --> 4899.02]  10 in the silica.
[4899.06 --> 4900.12]  I remember this one too.
[4900.78 --> 4903.12]  That was back before we really had Black Friday in Canada.
[4903.32 --> 4903.74]  I was like,
[4903.80 --> 4903.94]  well,
[4904.02 --> 4904.78]  what's a Black Friday?
[4905.04 --> 4905.28]  Yeah.
[4905.58 --> 4906.04]  It's like,
[4906.14 --> 4907.58]  I thought it meant that people died.
[4908.32 --> 4908.54]  Oh,
[4908.82 --> 4911.64]  it wasn't until I worked for a retailer that I,
[4911.76 --> 4915.84]  that I understood that it's supposed to be the first day of the year that retailers are in the black,
[4915.94 --> 4917.46]  not in the red in terms of profitability,
[4917.64 --> 4920.22]  which it isn't because everyone loses money on Black Friday.
[4921.26 --> 4921.86]  All right.
[4921.86 --> 4925.00]  So injuries and deaths this year looks like the longest list yet.
[4925.10 --> 4927.86]  So someone shot carrying a TV home from Target.
[4928.58 --> 4929.72]  There's a brawl,
[4929.86 --> 4931.54]  sends one police officer to hospital.
[4931.70 --> 4934.56]  Virginia man stabbed over a parking space.
[4936.26 --> 4937.68]  And you can see the link.
[4937.68 --> 4939.30]  So apparently there's been a death now.
[4939.40 --> 4941.10]  A teen returning home from Black Friday shopping,
[4941.22 --> 4942.10]  falls asleep at the wheel,
[4942.18 --> 4943.00]  is killed in the wreck.
[4943.34 --> 4943.86]  That one,
[4943.92 --> 4945.38]  I think you could debate whether that's,
[4945.38 --> 4946.18]  it's a little bit.
[4946.28 --> 4946.52]  Yeah,
[4946.62 --> 4947.28]  I would,
[4947.46 --> 4947.62]  if,
[4947.76 --> 4950.18]  if he camped out like crazy or something,
[4950.22 --> 4951.18]  I kind of get it.
[4951.18 --> 4951.64]  But like,
[4951.64 --> 4953.76]  yeah,
[4953.76 --> 4955.00]  just buy things online.
[4955.18 --> 4955.28]  Hey,
[4955.46 --> 4955.92]  like,
[4956.02 --> 4957.60]  please just go buy things online.
[4957.74 --> 4957.90]  Yeah.
[4957.98 --> 4958.54]  I mean,
[4958.66 --> 4959.08]  okay,
[4959.08 --> 4961.98]  you saved $40 or even if you saved $400,
[4962.52 --> 4964.68]  is it really worth it?
[4965.54 --> 4966.90]  But compared to online,
[4966.94 --> 4968.08]  you're probably not going to save $400.
[4968.50 --> 4968.88]  That's true.
[4969.00 --> 4971.98]  A lot of people have like straight up equivalent Black Friday sales online.
[4971.98 --> 4972.96]  They have great deals online.
[4973.14 --> 4973.34]  Like,
[4973.42 --> 4974.16]  check out Amazon.
[4974.50 --> 4975.64]  There's some really good sales.
[4975.66 --> 4975.90]  You know,
[4975.96 --> 4977.24]  I didn't find anything that appealing.
[4977.40 --> 4978.10]  I saw the,
[4978.10 --> 4978.44]  um,
[4978.60 --> 4980.36]  I saw the Audio-Technica M50s.
[4980.50 --> 4980.70]  Yeah.
[4980.76 --> 4981.68]  Those were at $99.99.
[4981.88 --> 4982.22]  I think,
[4982.30 --> 4982.50]  uh,
[4982.50 --> 4982.78]  Brandon,
[4982.86 --> 4984.12]  did you buy those M50s?
[4984.12 --> 4984.86]  They sold out.
[4985.60 --> 4987.20]  Did you buy those M50s?
[4987.66 --> 4987.98]  Yeah.
[4988.10 --> 4988.24]  Yeah,
[4988.24 --> 4988.70]  Brandon got them.
[4988.70 --> 4989.42]  I think they sold out.
[4989.52 --> 4990.28]  I was going to get them.
[4990.38 --> 4991.16]  Amazon like ran out of stock.
[4991.24 --> 4992.02]  I was thinking about it.
[4992.80 --> 4993.02]  But,
[4993.08 --> 4993.38]  um,
[4993.54 --> 4994.02]  have you seen,
[4994.16 --> 4994.74]  have you heard of,
[4994.84 --> 4995.22]  um,
[4995.84 --> 4996.06]  uh,
[4996.08 --> 4996.76]  what is it called?
[4998.16 --> 4998.64]  Uh,
[4998.88 --> 4999.94]  outlet Amazon?
[5000.52 --> 5000.82]  No.
[5001.14 --> 5002.88]  If you Google Amazon outlets,
[5003.30 --> 5003.70]  uh,
[5003.72 --> 5005.24]  let me see if I can find it real quick.
[5006.02 --> 5007.42]  Amazon outlets.
[5008.14 --> 5011.24]  And be sure to use our affiliate code.
[5011.26 --> 5011.36]  Yeah,
[5011.42 --> 5012.52]  LinusTechTips-20.
[5012.70 --> 5013.04]  So yeah,
[5013.08 --> 5014.26]  if you Google Amazon outlets,
[5014.38 --> 5020.10]  there's an outlet on Amazon where they're kind of getting rid of stuff and they have crazy sales all the time.
[5020.54 --> 5020.74]  Really?
[5020.74 --> 5021.96]  I haven't even heard of this before.
[5022.28 --> 5022.52]  Yeah.
[5023.16 --> 5023.40]  Like,
[5023.46 --> 5024.24]  apparently it's a thing.
[5024.46 --> 5026.16]  So there's like men's cufflinks,
[5026.36 --> 5027.24]  for example.
[5028.98 --> 5029.38]  Yeah,
[5029.46 --> 5030.00]  so it's like,
[5030.26 --> 5030.50]  hmm.
[5031.40 --> 5032.02]  Alrighty then.
[5032.46 --> 5032.70]  So,
[5032.78 --> 5033.96]  moving on to our next topic.
[5034.98 --> 5036.92]  Dell is teasing.
[5036.92 --> 5037.38]  Oh man.
[5037.64 --> 5038.42]  I know.
[5039.14 --> 5039.74]  I know.
[5040.02 --> 5043.50]  Dell is teasing a 4K 24 inch monitor.
[5043.88 --> 5044.16]  Now,
[5044.42 --> 5045.96]  you and I have had this conversation before.
[5046.00 --> 5047.62]  How do you feel about the 24 inch size?
[5048.46 --> 5048.72]  What,
[5048.78 --> 5048.96]  like,
[5049.10 --> 5049.36]  why,
[5049.36 --> 5053.66]  why the hell do we not have 2560 by 1440 or 2560 by 1600?
[5055.00 --> 5057.06]  Why the hell do we not have that?
[5057.14 --> 5057.52]  Because like,
[5057.60 --> 5058.06]  I went out,
[5058.32 --> 5059.50]  and I love 24 inch.
[5059.56 --> 5060.34]  24 inch is like,
[5060.72 --> 5061.02]  bam,
[5061.12 --> 5061.58]  I'm there.
[5061.70 --> 5062.58]  With 16 by 10,
[5062.64 --> 5063.20]  24 inch,
[5063.26 --> 5063.46]  like,
[5063.70 --> 5064.54]  yes,
[5064.70 --> 5065.18]  like it.
[5065.18 --> 5067.00]  But it's always been like,
[5067.00 --> 5069.56]  the best I could get was 1920 by 1200.
[5070.20 --> 5070.72]  Because it's like,
[5070.78 --> 5070.90]  yeah,
[5070.94 --> 5072.66]  there's no higher resolution than size.
[5073.28 --> 5073.58]  Oh,
[5073.66 --> 5073.90]  wow.
[5073.98 --> 5075.48]  I didn't even know it was wide gamut.
[5075.82 --> 5076.06]  Yeah.
[5077.08 --> 5079.78]  99% Adobe RGB coverage.
[5080.04 --> 5080.74]  Check my notes,
[5080.86 --> 5080.94]  bro.
[5081.04 --> 5081.62]  That's like,
[5081.72 --> 5083.14]  that's equivalent to,
[5083.14 --> 5083.60]  okay,
[5083.60 --> 5087.70]  so that's equivalent in terms of RGB coverage to,
[5087.84 --> 5090.96]  they're advertising a claim Delta E of less than two.
[5090.96 --> 5094.06]  So this is basically with 1 billion colors.
[5094.34 --> 5094.50]  Yeah.
[5094.60 --> 5095.84]  So this is a 10 bit panel.
[5096.10 --> 5096.28]  Yeah.
[5097.34 --> 5098.88]  Holy crap.
[5100.52 --> 5101.48]  Read my notes,
[5101.62 --> 5101.80]  dude.
[5103.04 --> 5103.32]  Oh,
[5104.00 --> 5104.72]  three year warranty.
[5105.20 --> 5106.84]  You can get a premium pixel guarantee.
[5107.24 --> 5110.18]  Details are unknown for this resolution screen,
[5110.28 --> 5112.26]  but if it's like the 32 inch of the same res,
[5112.46 --> 5114.42]  it'll be a zero bright pixel guarantee.
[5115.02 --> 5115.20]  Yeah,
[5115.22 --> 5115.60]  it's on there.
[5115.72 --> 5115.84]  No,
[5115.96 --> 5116.30]  it's,
[5116.42 --> 5116.78]  they have one.
[5117.04 --> 5118.34]  Holy crap.
[5118.34 --> 5120.48]  You know,
[5121.84 --> 5127.74]  Dell used to be such a driver of the LCD industry.
[5128.42 --> 5129.78]  Remember when Dell was,
[5130.38 --> 5130.52]  you know,
[5130.56 --> 5134.98]  Dell and Apple were the only ones that had the cojones to release a 30 inch monitor.
[5135.46 --> 5137.38]  Dell was the only one driving things.
[5137.46 --> 5143.12]  The 2405 FPW is legendary because it was a great monitor and at a fair price.
[5143.76 --> 5143.88]  Yeah,
[5143.92 --> 5144.66]  no pricing yet.
[5144.66 --> 5146.10]  No pricing yet for this one.
[5146.34 --> 5146.78]  On their website.
[5146.90 --> 5147.26]  Officially,
[5147.38 --> 5148.24]  I looked elsewhere.
[5148.34 --> 5149.34]  I did all,
[5149.58 --> 5150.32]  I did everything I could.
[5150.40 --> 5150.78]  No pricing.
[5150.90 --> 5151.06]  Well,
[5151.26 --> 5155.20]  basically I felt like they were asleep at the wheel for the last few years.
[5155.20 --> 5155.56]  It's like,
[5155.62 --> 5155.82]  yeah,
[5155.90 --> 5157.20]  here's kind of that one we did.
[5157.24 --> 5158.22]  And it's like kind of different,
[5158.32 --> 5158.74]  but like,
[5158.80 --> 5159.04]  whatever.
[5159.22 --> 5161.44]  We made the ID slightly uglier looking.
[5162.12 --> 5162.48]  Um,
[5162.58 --> 5163.30]  sorry about that.
[5163.34 --> 5163.58]  But,
[5164.08 --> 5164.36]  you know,
[5164.40 --> 5167.90]  here's some QC issues with revision A1 or A2 or B2 or whatever.
[5168.34 --> 5168.70]  Um,
[5168.74 --> 5177.74]  this is an opportunity that has been waiting for someone to grab it by the horns and place a bloody order for panels.
[5178.18 --> 5182.20]  Commit and bring it to market and we will show you how much we want it.
[5182.20 --> 5187.82]  I am really excited about this because it's one thing to talk about stupid things like that Seiki 50 inch,
[5188.02 --> 5188.18]  Yeah.
[5188.26 --> 5189.52]  55 inch 4K TV.
[5189.60 --> 5189.92]  You know what?
[5189.96 --> 5190.42]  Who cares?
[5190.70 --> 5191.84]  It's 30 Hertz input.
[5191.98 --> 5192.96]  And on top of that,
[5193.12 --> 5193.96]  the image quality,
[5194.06 --> 5196.02]  the contrast ratio is apparently terrible.
[5196.02 --> 5197.04]  Like just terrible.
[5197.44 --> 5198.84]  You might as well buy a 1080p TV.
[5198.84 --> 5200.20]  And isn't it like 30 Hertz?
[5200.68 --> 5200.90]  Yeah.
[5201.00 --> 5201.14]  Yeah.
[5201.14 --> 5202.76]  30 Hertz only because it's HDMI in.
[5203.08 --> 5203.98]  Who cares?
[5204.42 --> 5206.14]  So this on the other hand,
[5206.66 --> 5207.90]  yeah,
[5208.14 --> 5208.36]  it's,
[5208.42 --> 5209.32]  it's made by Dell.
[5209.32 --> 5211.58]  So I inherently trust it.
[5212.46 --> 5212.70]  Yep.
[5213.34 --> 5213.66]  Oh.
[5213.86 --> 5215.72]  I've never had a Dell monitor that I've been like,
[5215.76 --> 5216.06]  oh wow,
[5216.10 --> 5217.14]  that was built poorly.
[5217.34 --> 5219.54]  My wife's still using our 2405 FPW.
[5219.70 --> 5222.58]  I was sitting with you the other day when we found the buy,
[5222.58 --> 5222.80]  sell,
[5222.90 --> 5226.58]  trade thread that I bought by 2405 FPW off of.
[5226.68 --> 5229.34]  I left the guy feedback in his thread on red flag deals.
[5229.40 --> 5229.72]  That was what?
[5229.98 --> 5230.42]  2006?
[5230.92 --> 5232.08]  I thought it was five,
[5233.08 --> 5233.88]  somewhere around there.
[5233.98 --> 5234.02]  Yeah.
[5234.02 --> 5234.26]  Whatever.
[5234.42 --> 5234.72]  Anyway.
[5235.90 --> 5236.80]  So I,
[5236.90 --> 5237.20]  I,
[5237.40 --> 5238.16]  so I was like,
[5238.18 --> 5238.62]  oh wow,
[5238.76 --> 5239.82]  that monitor is still working.
[5239.96 --> 5241.12]  It's still on my wife's desk.
[5241.12 --> 5242.12]  Like eight years later,
[5242.24 --> 5243.30]  it's starting to fade.
[5243.62 --> 5244.02]  I have,
[5244.08 --> 5246.62]  I have LG monitors that have been lasting.
[5247.00 --> 5252.04]  Like I have an LG monitor that got booted in the screen really hard.
[5252.04 --> 5256.86]  Also one was running through my house and it fell flat on its back and like got nailed.
[5257.08 --> 5258.30]  And there's just a little crack.
[5258.52 --> 5258.68]  Wow.
[5258.82 --> 5261.26]  The rest of the screen has lost no quality and it still works.
[5261.34 --> 5262.82]  And it's like 10 years old.
[5262.82 --> 5265.28]  Did I tell you Rumble knocked over her 2405?
[5266.04 --> 5270.78]  She jumped on it and knocked it over flat onto the desk just the way he did with my 30 inch.
[5270.98 --> 5271.62]  I'll kill him.
[5272.12 --> 5272.80]  I'll kill him.
[5272.96 --> 5273.44]  If he breaks,
[5273.54 --> 5275.10]  if he breaks my 279Q,
[5275.18 --> 5275.66]  I'll kill him.
[5275.88 --> 5276.50]  Mark my words.
[5276.66 --> 5277.70]  I think that's illegal.
[5277.94 --> 5278.52]  I'll skin him.
[5279.90 --> 5280.30]  Wow.
[5281.74 --> 5283.12]  I was so mad.
[5284.22 --> 5285.30]  Like not okay.
[5285.50 --> 5286.40]  You should just lock him out of that room.
[5286.40 --> 5286.70]  I'm,
[5286.70 --> 5287.02]  I'm,
[5287.02 --> 5287.64]  I'm kidding.
[5287.68 --> 5288.48]  I know you're kidding.
[5288.74 --> 5289.08]  I mean,
[5289.16 --> 5289.50]  if I,
[5289.58 --> 5291.22]  if I haven't killed Brockett yet,
[5291.46 --> 5292.70]  I'm not going to kill,
[5292.70 --> 5294.24]  but he's been peeing on the couch again,
[5294.24 --> 5295.80]  not just on the couch,
[5295.80 --> 5298.16]  all over the window and the blinds.
[5298.16 --> 5298.70]  And like,
[5298.74 --> 5300.52]  it is such a mess to clean up.
[5300.64 --> 5301.04]  My mom,
[5301.12 --> 5307.38]  my mom tried to train my dog to like go to the washroom inside on this like mat thing.
[5307.40 --> 5309.00]  And that was a terrible idea.
[5309.00 --> 5310.32]  And it like kind of worked,
[5310.32 --> 5311.36]  but then stopped working.
[5311.36 --> 5312.00]  And then it was,
[5312.10 --> 5312.24]  yeah,
[5312.26 --> 5312.74]  it was a mess.
[5313.16 --> 5313.48]  She,
[5313.56 --> 5314.58]  she got it a diaper,
[5314.58 --> 5316.86]  but it won't,
[5316.94 --> 5318.44]  it won't go in the diaper.
[5319.94 --> 5321.94]  So she puts a diaper on it when it comes inside.
[5321.98 --> 5322.68]  So it won't go.
[5322.84 --> 5323.18]  And,
[5323.26 --> 5325.02]  but then it'll like complain when it needs to go.
[5325.10 --> 5326.44]  So my mom will take it off and put it outside.
[5326.54 --> 5327.04]  Then it comes.
[5327.04 --> 5330.58]  So she can just use one all the time.
[5330.68 --> 5331.32]  It's fantastic.
[5331.46 --> 5331.48]  Oh,
[5331.50 --> 5331.94]  Chloe.
[5332.36 --> 5333.32]  It's fantastic.
[5333.46 --> 5334.08]  I love Chloe.
[5334.20 --> 5334.82]  She's awesome.
[5334.96 --> 5335.70]  She's pretty awesome.
[5335.78 --> 5336.56]  She's awesome.
[5336.78 --> 5338.68]  We should totally do a video about your dog.
[5338.80 --> 5339.20]  Yeah.
[5340.12 --> 5341.06]  Your dog's awesome.
[5341.96 --> 5344.68]  His mom is like a genius dog trainer,
[5344.98 --> 5346.38]  like genius dog trainer.
[5346.42 --> 5346.78]  My dog.
[5346.78 --> 5347.68]  It's amazing.
[5347.82 --> 5348.40]  If you lean forward,
[5348.50 --> 5349.48]  she'll come up and scratch your back.
[5349.48 --> 5349.70]  Yeah.
[5349.98 --> 5350.58]  I'll do that too.
[5350.94 --> 5351.36]  Thank you.
[5351.48 --> 5351.66]  Thank you.
[5351.70 --> 5352.18]  That's fantastic.
[5352.66 --> 5354.30]  She can play the drums on Tuberware.
[5354.50 --> 5355.88]  She can put herself in Tuberware.
[5355.94 --> 5356.60]  If you drop money,
[5356.70 --> 5358.04]  she'll grab it and take it to his mom.
[5360.18 --> 5361.38]  I think my favorite though,
[5361.38 --> 5361.96]  is when you're like,
[5362.06 --> 5364.16]  she falls over and she's like,
[5364.24 --> 5367.48]  and even if I do it,
[5367.52 --> 5368.76]  like she doesn't even have to listen to me.
[5368.84 --> 5369.94]  I don't have any treats or anything.
[5370.20 --> 5370.36]  Yeah.
[5370.52 --> 5370.84]  All right.
[5370.84 --> 5372.10]  So moving on to our next topic.
[5372.20 --> 5372.90]  And she's a chihuahua.
[5373.16 --> 5376.74]  The U.S. government caught pirating military software.
[5377.14 --> 5377.44]  It's like,
[5377.50 --> 5380.04]  who else were they going to sell it to if not you?
[5380.28 --> 5381.70]  Do you realize what you're doing?
[5383.16 --> 5383.52]  Well,
[5383.56 --> 5385.84]  they didn't catch them because of like too many installs.
[5385.88 --> 5387.20]  They caught them because they just like,
[5387.66 --> 5389.12]  talked about how many they had installed.
[5389.22 --> 5389.58]  And they were like,
[5389.64 --> 5389.76]  wait,
[5389.82 --> 5390.04]  what?
[5390.50 --> 5390.74]  They're like,
[5390.78 --> 5391.02]  yeah.
[5391.18 --> 5391.46]  They're like,
[5391.64 --> 5392.16]  but you only,
[5392.50 --> 5393.24]  but you only bought.
[5394.58 --> 5395.88]  It's not a thing.
[5396.68 --> 5398.88]  So they,
[5398.88 --> 5405.62]  so they pirated around $250 million worth of software.
[5405.86 --> 5409.54]  They were sued for the total amount and managed to settle at 50 million.
[5409.54 --> 5411.72]  And so we're in the U.S. military.
[5412.50 --> 5415.58]  And we don't have any money because the government shuts down.
[5415.68 --> 5415.76]  Oh,
[5415.76 --> 5415.86]  no.
[5416.10 --> 5416.42]  Sorry.
[5416.52 --> 5416.74]  Sorry.
[5416.74 --> 5418.16]  I shouldn't be taking cracks at Americans.
[5418.34 --> 5418.84]  I love you guys.
[5419.28 --> 5420.34]  I was more saying like,
[5420.34 --> 5423.06]  they're just so big and powerful that they could probably just be like,
[5423.14 --> 5423.24]  yeah,
[5423.24 --> 5424.32]  this is how much we're paying you.
[5424.44 --> 5424.58]  Yeah.
[5424.60 --> 5425.50]  And if you don't like it,
[5425.54 --> 5426.88]  then we'll never buy anything from you again.
[5426.88 --> 5428.98]  And you won't exist because we're the U.S. military.
[5428.98 --> 5429.88]  And that was the thing.
[5430.00 --> 5430.32]  Like the,
[5430.40 --> 5432.60]  a statement came up from the guys that made the software and they're like,
[5432.62 --> 5432.78]  yep,
[5432.86 --> 5433.04]  yep,
[5433.12 --> 5433.28]  yep.
[5433.34 --> 5433.48]  No,
[5433.52 --> 5434.68]  we're still working with them in the future.
[5436.22 --> 5436.90]  So they,
[5436.96 --> 5440.94]  they purchased licenses for five servers and 150 standalone devices.
[5440.94 --> 5446.12]  They ended up installing it on 93 servers and over 9,000 standalone devices.
[5446.26 --> 5447.98]  Over 9,000.
[5447.98 --> 5451.08]  Just insane.
[5451.32 --> 5453.00]  I absolutely insane.
[5453.48 --> 5454.44]  Completely off the wall.
[5454.56 --> 5455.06]  I love it.
[5455.24 --> 5455.86]  And it's like,
[5456.06 --> 5456.34]  you know,
[5456.38 --> 5461.30]  the funny thing is the RIAA and the MPAA are going to run around trying to put people in jail for pirate.
[5461.38 --> 5462.46]  Like who goes to jail for this?
[5462.98 --> 5463.34]  No one.
[5463.56 --> 5463.76]  Yeah.
[5464.04 --> 5464.20]  No.
[5464.72 --> 5465.08]  So.
[5466.80 --> 5473.14]  And I love how sometimes you get sued for this and you get sued for like way more than percentage of worth.
[5473.26 --> 5473.40]  No,
[5473.42 --> 5473.48]  no,
[5473.48 --> 5473.64]  no,
[5473.64 --> 5473.76]  no,
[5473.76 --> 5473.84]  no,
[5473.84 --> 5473.94]  no,
[5473.94 --> 5473.96]  no,
[5473.96 --> 5474.00]  no,
[5474.00 --> 5474.06]  no,
[5474.06 --> 5474.08]  no,
[5474.08 --> 5474.12]  no,
[5474.12 --> 5474.14]  no,
[5474.14 --> 5474.16]  no,
[5474.16 --> 5474.20]  no,
[5474.20 --> 5474.22]  no,
[5474.22 --> 5474.24]  no,
[5474.24 --> 5474.26]  no,
[5474.26 --> 5474.32]  no,
[5474.32 --> 5474.34]  no,
[5474.34 --> 5474.42]  no,
[5474.42 --> 5474.44]  no,
[5474.44 --> 5474.46]  no,
[5474.46 --> 5475.26]  no,
[5475.26 --> 5475.38]  no,
[5475.38 --> 5476.38]  no,
[5476.38 --> 5476.46]  no,
[5476.46 --> 5476.72]  no,
[5476.72 --> 5477.26]  no,
[5477.86 --> 5479.36]  that's not right.
[5479.94 --> 5481.06]  So instead of us buying.
[5481.34 --> 5483.38]  How many licenses of Creative Cloud do we have?
[5483.82 --> 5484.06]  Three,
[5484.14 --> 5484.28]  right?
[5485.56 --> 5486.02]  Brandon,
[5486.22 --> 5486.58]  Edzel,
[5486.72 --> 5487.82]  and then you.
[5488.16 --> 5489.98]  So instead of buying three licenses,
[5490.12 --> 5490.90]  we should just buy one.
[5491.24 --> 5494.26]  And then if Adobe sues us for like pirating the rest of our stuff,
[5494.50 --> 5494.62]  they go,
[5495.10 --> 5495.42]  we'll just pay for one.
[5495.48 --> 5495.58]  Yeah,
[5495.66 --> 5496.72]  we'll just don't worry about it.
[5496.76 --> 5497.48]  We paid you for one.
[5497.80 --> 5498.62]  So that one fifth,
[5498.70 --> 5498.94]  right?
[5499.18 --> 5499.90]  That's yeah.
[5500.22 --> 5501.44]  We're paying a little bit over one.
[5501.58 --> 5501.90]  Yeah.
[5502.02 --> 5502.76]  Don't worry about it.
[5502.78 --> 5503.32]  It's all good.
[5503.54 --> 5504.10]  We got this.
[5504.66 --> 5505.12]  No,
[5505.46 --> 5506.12]  be cool.
[5506.12 --> 5509.94]  So speaking of being cool, this is ridiculous.
[5510.54 --> 5513.56]  The city of Vancouver, that's where we live proudly.
[5513.84 --> 5514.44]  Oh, amazing.
[5514.64 --> 5516.96]  Bands doorknobs, which I thought was a joke.
[5517.32 --> 5518.54]  Like I really did think it was a joke.
[5518.54 --> 5523.18]  Honestly, this was, I can't say this on the air, but I accidentally scrolled through it.
[5523.88 --> 5533.84]  So the city of Vancouver has amended its building code to outlaw the use of those wrist twisting devices in all new construction, including private homes.
[5533.84 --> 5544.06]  Doorknobs had already been a non-thing in large buildings, but the new ruling effective in March will affect private homes and large buildings.
[5544.06 --> 5551.80]  However, it will not affect existing homes, so it looks like I will not have to retrofit my house to remove doorknobs.
[5552.66 --> 5554.48]  Why? Do we really?
[5554.68 --> 5556.26]  And this is from TheStar, TheStar.com.
[5556.28 --> 5558.22]  I kind of get it for public buildings.
[5558.78 --> 5563.10]  I don't really understand banning it for private housing.
[5563.10 --> 5571.58]  I mean, and the funny thing is like people praising it, like there's a quote from a professor, professor specializing in universal design.
[5572.06 --> 5573.94]  That's very progressive of Vancouver.
[5574.62 --> 5576.06]  Leavers make access easier.
[5577.96 --> 5578.60]  I'm sorry?
[5579.50 --> 5580.16]  No, never mind.
[5580.32 --> 5583.48]  Yeah, leavers, so I mean we're not banning having things on doors.
[5583.64 --> 5584.54]  Like leavers are still okay.
[5584.54 --> 5589.46]  And I will say that yes, I do indeed think that leavers are easier to use.
[5589.84 --> 5592.04]  However, why ban them?
[5593.20 --> 5594.22]  It just seems excessive.
[5594.80 --> 5596.52]  I do get it for public buildings.
[5596.96 --> 5598.36]  Yeah, okay, I get that.
[5598.64 --> 5599.88]  Accessibility, what not what I want to.
[5600.02 --> 5604.38]  But like if someone's like, I really want to have doorknobs on my own house.
[5605.18 --> 5607.00]  They should be able to probably put doorknobs.
[5608.10 --> 5610.50]  So, yeah, I just, I just, you know.
[5610.64 --> 5612.38]  Why are we wasting energy on this?
[5612.46 --> 5615.24]  The doorknob, okay, so there's people saying, I say good riddance.
[5615.30 --> 5617.00]  It never functions well, explains Jerry.
[5617.08 --> 5618.70]  I don't view it as a good piece of design.
[5619.14 --> 5619.38]  Okay.
[5619.80 --> 5621.76]  And then someone else is like, oh, blah, blah, blah.
[5622.00 --> 5624.14]  I have a strong feeling about the hardware.
[5624.26 --> 5625.02]  Doorknobs are lovely.
[5625.22 --> 5626.24]  They're the jewelry of the door.
[5626.46 --> 5628.54]  Like, you know what?
[5628.64 --> 5629.34]  Everyone just.
[5629.58 --> 5635.04]  It doesn't matter so much that the reason why I'm surprised by it and kind of like what
[5635.04 --> 5638.02]  the hell is why anyone bothered to do anything about it.
[5638.12 --> 5640.04]  I'm not necessarily that mad that it changed.
[5640.04 --> 5641.80]  If I bought a new house and it's like, oh.
[5642.12 --> 5643.00]  There aren't doorknobs.
[5643.64 --> 5644.32]  That's okay.
[5644.96 --> 5646.68]  My house doesn't have doorknobs.
[5646.88 --> 5647.82]  I had to think about it.
[5648.14 --> 5648.66]  Oh, good point.
[5648.66 --> 5650.20]  I don't know if my parents does.
[5650.22 --> 5650.58]  There is one.
[5650.64 --> 5652.30]  The external garage uses a doorknob.
[5652.48 --> 5652.78]  Okay.
[5652.94 --> 5655.06]  So I would have to, I would have to not have that there.
[5655.16 --> 5656.56]  Yes, we have at least one.
[5656.84 --> 5657.18]  Yes.
[5657.40 --> 5659.96]  I don't know if our front door does at my parents' house.
[5660.72 --> 5662.82]  But the garage door does, just like yours.
[5663.48 --> 5664.30]  Does it matter?
[5664.58 --> 5664.98]  No.
[5665.58 --> 5667.46]  People freaking out over Google Glass again.
[5667.54 --> 5668.80]  Speaking of which, I just got mine.
[5668.88 --> 5671.46]  If you watched Netlinked Daily today, then you'll have seen that.
[5671.60 --> 5672.78]  Have you had anyone?
[5673.44 --> 5674.52]  No one's even noticed.
[5674.80 --> 5676.04]  I went to a movie theater with them.
[5676.64 --> 5677.02]  Wow.
[5677.24 --> 5677.46]  Yeah.
[5677.46 --> 5678.68]  That's kind of...
[5678.68 --> 5679.60]  No one gave any cares.
[5682.00 --> 5685.38]  So it was the same guy as last time, but he's banned it from his diner.
[5685.50 --> 5688.76]  He's asked people to remove the $1,500 headset or leave.
[5688.76 --> 5689.98]  Um...
[5689.98 --> 5691.98]  So...
[5692.64 --> 5693.66]  It's the same guy...
[5693.66 --> 5695.06]  You remember the, like, bar or whatever?
[5695.18 --> 5695.44]  Yeah.
[5695.56 --> 5695.72]  The pub?
[5696.00 --> 5697.28]  The same owner owns this place.
[5697.30 --> 5697.48]  Yep.
[5697.98 --> 5699.56]  So, like, it's not that surprising.
[5699.76 --> 5701.02]  I mean, okay, blah, blah, blah.
[5701.18 --> 5701.52]  It's about...
[5701.52 --> 5703.76]  How much the guy freaked out is hilarious.
[5705.66 --> 5710.68]  Oh my god, if he doesn't want to lose my continued revenue, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[5710.68 --> 5711.84]  It's like, settle down.
[5711.96 --> 5712.82]  Go somewhere else.
[5713.12 --> 5714.24]  Yeah, I think it's...
[5714.24 --> 5714.84]  I take them off.
[5714.86 --> 5717.64]  It's going to get more interesting when prescription Google Glass is a thing.
[5717.72 --> 5718.26]  Yeah, yeah.
[5718.26 --> 5721.82]  Um, you know, it's like, yeah, I need you to take off your prescription glasses or you can't come in here.
[5721.90 --> 5723.54]  It's like, well, I can't see if I take them off.
[5723.68 --> 5724.02]  Yeah.
[5724.70 --> 5725.70]  They're so uncomfortable.
[5726.46 --> 5727.46]  They're, like, super uncomfortable.
[5727.46 --> 5728.62]  They should be detachable.
[5729.30 --> 5730.26]  That would be kind of cool.
[5730.38 --> 5733.68]  But then maybe that would add, um, build quality problems.
[5733.76 --> 5734.06]  Yeah.
[5734.06 --> 5734.16]  Yeah.
[5734.16 --> 5737.18]  I don't know, man.
[5738.68 --> 5740.64]  Well, I think that's pretty much it for this week.
[5740.76 --> 5740.92]  Thank you.
[5740.92 --> 5742.02]  Oh, do you have, uh, build bugs?
[5742.14 --> 5742.64]  I do not.
[5742.74 --> 5743.52]  You do not have build bugs.
[5743.56 --> 5743.74]  Okay.
[5743.98 --> 5746.20]  Thank you guys very much for watching the WAN show today.
[5746.32 --> 5749.08]  Big thanks to our special guest, Kyle, from Newegg TV.
[5749.62 --> 5751.14]  And thank you guys for watching.
[5751.26 --> 5752.44]  I think I already said that once.
[5752.62 --> 5755.76]  It's a good thing we're not keeping on going because we're going to have a repeat of last week.
[5755.76 --> 5757.68]  And I don't think anyone wants to see that.
[5758.06 --> 5758.66]  Peace out, guys.
[5758.74 --> 5760.28]  And we'll see you again next week.
[5760.28 --> 5764.10]  If you tuned in late, guys, we will have the archive up in a timely manner today because
[5764.10 --> 5766.18]  we didn't have any technical difficulties.
[5766.40 --> 5770.80]  I want to take a moment to explain why the archive takes so long to put up sometimes.
[5770.98 --> 5777.48]  It has to do with, um, any technical issues during the stream that cause us to have to
[5777.48 --> 5782.46]  take the footage and convert it from variable frame rate footage to non-variable frame rate
[5782.46 --> 5785.70]  footage, then cut it back together, re-export it, then re-upload it.
[5785.70 --> 5790.46]  In order to not lose an enormous amount of quality in that process, we have to output
[5790.46 --> 5791.72]  extremely large files.
[5791.82 --> 5796.28]  And because the show is so long, it's really a time consuming, both for the export and for
[5796.28 --> 5796.80]  the upload.
[5796.96 --> 5802.40]  So by the time it's actually up, it's like midday Saturday and we like have things to
[5802.40 --> 5802.60]  do.
[5802.86 --> 5803.08]  Yeah.
[5803.34 --> 5808.16]  And then I can't really make the timestamps below it because I'm out doing stuff or
[5808.16 --> 5808.44]  whatever.
[5808.64 --> 5808.80]  Yeah.
[5808.92 --> 5810.32]  It becomes a mess.
[5810.54 --> 5813.24]  But when it can go up right away, then we'll get it up right away.
[5813.42 --> 5813.84]  Thanks guys.
[5813.84 --> 5817.34]  Speaking of one thing before we leave, actually speaking of the variable frame rate problem,
[5817.58 --> 5821.34]  a lot of people have been talking about shadow play lately and been trying to use it and having
[5821.34 --> 5822.96]  problems editing videos like we did.
[5823.32 --> 5824.88]  Oh, it's that.
[5825.52 --> 5826.80]  Is it variable frame rate recording?
[5826.82 --> 5827.86]  It's variable frame rate recording.
[5828.00 --> 5831.16]  I think I've read a bunch of stuff on it and apparently one of the ways you can fix it
[5831.16 --> 5833.06]  is by converting it in programs like Handbrake.
[5833.54 --> 5833.88]  Okay.
[5834.04 --> 5837.74]  But then I have people that have found that that's not really helping and stuff because
[5837.74 --> 5840.88]  if you pull shadow play, if you watch shadow play footage in something like Windows
[5840.88 --> 5841.86]  Media Player, it's perfect.
[5841.86 --> 5847.82]  But then if you try to edit it in something like Premiere, the audio and video become unaligned.
[5847.90 --> 5850.86]  If you watch my Battlefield 4 graphics cards comparison...
[5851.64 --> 5853.80]  That's exactly what used to happen with Landshel.
[5854.02 --> 5854.30]  Yeah.
[5854.46 --> 5855.46]  And if you watch the...
[5855.46 --> 5856.14]  Yeah, exactly.
[5856.34 --> 5856.86]  So like...
[5857.34 --> 5858.22]  I wonder if that's it.
[5858.28 --> 5858.96]  You know what, guys?
[5858.96 --> 5863.36]  For anyone who's been struggling with this with shadow play, I'm going to go ahead.
[5863.42 --> 5864.92]  I'm going to find out if there's a way to...
[5865.92 --> 5866.34]  You know what?
[5866.34 --> 5867.56]  Maybe I'll just tweet this out.
[5868.34 --> 5872.60]  But I'll tweet out the video that I use as my guide every time.
[5872.72 --> 5874.74]  Embarrassingly enough, I can never remember how to do it.
[5874.74 --> 5878.08]  But I use as my guide for how to fix that problem.
[5878.32 --> 5883.36]  It actually only takes a couple minutes to re-sync things.
[5883.74 --> 5885.74]  So I think it's in my favorite videos.
[5886.44 --> 5887.22]  But it's awesome.
[5887.96 --> 5888.38]  Here it is.
[5888.38 --> 5891.36]  It only has 10,000 views, which means not enough people are watching it.
[5892.64 --> 5892.98]  Or here.
[5893.04 --> 5894.44]  Actually, I can just show you guys what it's called.
[5894.58 --> 5894.70]  There.
