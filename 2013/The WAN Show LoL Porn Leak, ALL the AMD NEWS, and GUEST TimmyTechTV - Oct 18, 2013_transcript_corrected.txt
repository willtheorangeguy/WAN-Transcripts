[0.56 → 6.40] Alright, I do believe we're live and tried to be two minutes beforehand just like last
[6.40 → 12.64] week but almost failed because our person that does the art things decided to kind of
[12.64 → 14.90] not do the art things this week.
[14.90 → 19.02] So I had to kind of ghetto rig a picture together for our guest.
[19.02 → 24.96] So if you look at the guest picture, it's actually the same one from last week.
[24.96 → 26.68] This one's wrong, unfortunately.
[26.68 → 29.64] The Linus Tech thing is wrong, unfortunately.
[29.64 → 34.76] And then that's actually Total Biscuits picture and I added another source file and then
[34.76 → 39.52] like sized it over top of that one, and then I did a screen capture of the TimmyTechTV
[39.52 → 43.80] thing and then added that one and like resized it and put it on top and I like...
[43.80 → 45.02] Looks good though.
[45.02 → 46.02] It's super ghetto rigged.
[46.02 → 47.02] End result.
[47.02 → 48.02] Doesn't matter.
[48.02 → 49.02] End result.
[49.02 → 50.02] It worked.
[50.02 → 51.02] Wins.
[51.02 → 52.02] We're good.
[52.02 → 53.02] Yeah.
[53.02 → 54.02] So I was pretty happy with that which is cool.
[54.02 → 57.02] Um, we've got some fascinating stuff this week.
[57.02 → 58.42] Like seriously interesting stuff.
[58.42 → 59.30] The GPU wars.
[59.30 → 60.46] Like we talked about this last week.
[60.46 → 61.46] The GPU wars.
[61.46 → 62.46] Uh huh.
[62.46 → 63.66] Where it was a big thing last week.
[63.66 → 66.70] This week the GPU wars are on a completely different level.
[66.70 → 67.70] Like they're...
[67.70 → 70.98] Last week they were like, hmm yes, duelling gloves.
[70.98 → 75.54] This week they're like grunge, gorilla fighting, we're going to kill you all.
[75.54 → 76.54] It's ridiculous.
[76.54 → 77.54] Um...
[77.54 → 78.70] They're marching pretty hard.
[78.70 → 79.70] They're marching pretty hard.
[79.70 → 80.78] They're mirroring also there though.
[80.78 → 81.78] They're not just marching.
[81.78 → 82.78] They're not just marching.
[82.78 → 83.78] They're starting to show up.
[83.78 → 84.78] They're not just marching for a long time.
[84.78 → 86.82] That was when they were building the graphics cards.
[86.82 → 88.82] They're making the graphics cards.
[88.82 → 89.82] But now they're both releasing.
[89.82 → 90.82] So they're doing the mirroring.
[90.82 → 93.82] They're trying to get all the cards to all the different stores and position them and
[93.82 → 94.82] everything.
[94.82 → 95.82] They haven't started trading yet though.
[95.82 → 96.82] We'll have to see.
[96.82 → 98.54] Yeah, they haven't been trading much.
[98.54 → 101.66] For people that are wondering about the rocket info, that's Linus' cat.
[101.66 → 103.06] He is home.
[103.06 → 105.02] The whole operation is complete.
[105.02 → 109.82] We contacted the dude that got us in contact with the girl, and then I got Linus' wife in
[109.82 → 114.10] contact with the girl and Linus' wife went down there immediately and got the cat.
[114.10 → 116.06] He's very thin.
[116.06 → 117.06] Like incredibly thin.
[117.06 → 121.82] But he's home, and he's happy, and he's hanging out with Rumble and Rumble is all ridiculously
[121.82 → 122.82] happy.
[122.82 → 123.82] So the cats are all happy.
[123.82 → 124.82] The cats are all together.
[124.82 → 126.82] We're going to get him fed.
[126.82 → 127.82] Yeah.
[127.82 → 128.82] Apparently he's pretty skinny right now.
[128.82 → 129.82] So yeah.
[129.82 → 133.82] We're going to get him fed a lot hopefully so he can get some of that weight back because
[133.82 → 138.44] he's at an unhealthy, probably unhealthy level of weight right now which is not good.
[138.44 → 140.74] But the cat's back.
[140.74 → 142.68] The GPU wars are on.
[142.68 → 148.06] Some dude that plays League of Legends leaked his girlfriend's photos on his Facebook.
[148.06 → 149.20] Are we starting with that right away?
[149.20 → 150.58] No, we're not starting with that right away.
[150.58 → 151.58] I'm just doing the talking topics.
[151.58 → 152.58] Oh, okay.
[152.58 → 153.58] My bad.
[153.58 → 156.58] I'm going to talk about that later because I'm assuming you're on the same team as me.
[156.58 → 157.58] Yeah.
[157.58 → 158.58] Move a little closer.
[158.58 → 159.58] I feel like I'm dominating the...
[159.58 → 160.58] Hey buddy.
[160.58 → 161.58] How's it going?
[161.58 → 163.58] And then Blizzard's dropping bombs.
[163.58 → 165.58] So I think those are our main topics.
[165.58 → 166.58] I'm really excited about that.
[166.58 → 167.58] The cat's back.
[167.58 → 168.58] GP wars are on.
[168.58 → 173.58] Blizzard's dropping bombs and some jerk face posted his girlfriend's pictures on the Facebook.
[173.58 → 175.58] So we're going to run the intro and hope it works.
[175.58 → 176.58] And it didn't.
[176.58 → 188.58] I know why that didn't work too.
[188.58 → 192.76] It didn't work because it's trying to run off of something that it's no longer connected
[192.76 → 198.58] to because Linus was running media files off the server instead of off the local computer.
[198.58 → 199.58] Which is like...
[199.58 → 201.58] I was trying to figure out why.
[201.58 → 202.58] Probably not the best idea.
[202.58 → 203.58] I should probably just have a little bit of it.
[203.58 → 204.58] We just went with it.
[204.58 → 205.58] There we go.
[205.58 → 206.58] Oh!
[206.58 → 207.58] Oh!
[207.58 → 208.58] Oh!
[208.58 → 209.58] Oh!
[209.58 → 210.58] Oh!
[210.58 → 211.58] Oh!
[211.58 → 212.58] Oh!
[212.58 → 213.58] Oh!
[213.58 → 214.58] Oh!
[214.58 → 215.58] Oh!
[215.58 → 216.58] Oh!
[216.58 → 217.58] Oh!
[217.58 → 218.58] Oh!
[218.58 → 219.58] Oh!
[219.58 → 220.58] Oh!
[220.58 → 221.58] Oh!
[221.58 → 222.58] Oh!
[222.58 → 223.58] Oh!
[223.58 → 224.58] Oh!
[224.58 → 225.58] Oh!
[225.58 → 226.58] Oh!
[226.58 → 227.58] Oh!
[227.58 → 228.58] Oh!
[228.58 → 229.58] Oh!
[229.58 → 230.58] Oh!
[230.58 → 231.58] I don't have Racer comes anymore.
[231.58 → 232.58] No.
[232.58 → 235.58] But we still kind of have their branding everywhere because that art dude.
[235.58 → 236.58] Too lazy.
[236.58 → 237.58] I swear.
[237.58 → 240.58] Um, that's why I wear my Bear dynamics now.
[240.58 → 241.58] No big deal.
[241.58 → 244.58] Um, I got a lot of call-outs for that last week.
[244.58 → 245.58] I love these.
[245.58 → 246.58] They're awesome.
[246.58 → 247.58] The bass is incredible.
[247.58 → 248.58] The bass is incredible.
[248.58 → 250.58] And the bass port is really cool too.
[250.58 → 255.58] And as someone who has always idolized bass, someone who might have two 12s in his truck,
[255.58 → 259.58] that's, uh, you know, having a bass style headphone is really cool.
[259.58 → 262.58] They sound not as good as your open ear Sennheiser.
[262.58 → 263.58] Yeah.
[263.58 → 264.58] I forget which model number.
[264.58 → 265.58] Um, 595s.
[265.58 → 270.58] But basically, if, don't necessarily buy 595s, buy the 555s and then remove the little thing
[270.58 → 271.58] and they're the same.
[271.58 → 272.58] You got some sales in your chair.
[272.58 → 275.58] I got a crazy sale so they were cheaper than 555s, which is redonkey link and that doesn't
[275.58 → 276.58] actually really happen.
[276.58 → 278.58] So, that was lucky.
[278.58 → 282.58] Um, let's jump below the guest topics and talk first about Riva Tuner.
[282.58 → 287.58] Before we actually get into like the juicy GPU versus GPU wars that we're going to be
[287.58 → 290.58] getting in and talking about later, we're going to start with Riva Tuner.
[290.58 → 295.58] So, what Riva Tuner is, is basically it's the back end for a lot of what you guys use
[295.58 → 296.58] for graphics card overclocking.
[296.58 → 300.58] So, I'm going to actually just focus on two right now, but it's basically the back end
[300.58 → 301.58] for everything.
[301.58 → 305.58] Um, afterburner and VGA's Precision.
[305.58 → 306.58] There we go.
[306.58 → 307.58] X-Precision thing.
[307.58 → 309.58] Um, I couldn't remember what it was called for a second.
[309.58 → 317.58] So, the news going on about this is that it's Riva Tuner won't support 64-bit or X64.
[317.58 → 320.58] It will support 64-bit.
[320.58 → 321.58] You can still overclock your graphics card.
[321.58 → 325.58] What won't work, there was a bunch of hype about that, what won't work is the overlay
[325.58 → 328.58] I was wondering why there's so much hype about that.
[328.58 → 330.58] I was like, dude, we've had 64-bit operating systems.
[330.58 → 333.58] You're probably running one right now.
[333.58 → 335.58] And you're probably overclocking on it right now.
[335.58 → 336.58] Why are you freaking out?
[336.58 → 337.58] Yeah.
[337.58 → 338.58] Anyway, so, no big deal.
[338.58 → 344.58] But, what's not going to work is the OSD, the on-screen display in the top left-hand corner.
[344.58 → 349.58] Which, while that does kind of suck, is not like huge deal.
[349.58 → 350.58] It's not breaking.
[350.58 → 351.58] No.
[351.58 → 355.58] I really don't feel like it's, you know, and a lot of people look for FPS.
[355.58 → 356.58] Stuff like that.
[356.58 → 357.58] Fraps is a great way.
[357.58 → 358.58] Fraps shows FPS.
[358.58 → 361.58] There was one thing that was suggested by the person who posted this on the forum.
[361.58 → 364.58] Actually, if we can jump, if you can bring it up, that would be great.
[364.58 → 369.58] That is the if you scroll up a little bit and go to the Riva Tuner thing right under guest topics.
[369.58 → 371.58] So go down below guest topics.
[371.58 → 372.58] Sorry guys.
[372.58 → 374.58] Riva Tuner right there.
[374.58 → 375.58] Yep.
[375.58 → 376.58] And bring up the post on the forum.
[376.58 → 380.58] Just because I want to give a shout-out to the dude who actually posted this on the forum.
[380.58 → 381.58] Once it loads.
[381.58 → 382.58] Sorry guys.
[382.58 → 385.58] I actually, I guess while it's loading, I had everything open.
[385.58 → 387.58] Then I realized there was no way I could navigate through all these tabs.
[387.58 → 388.58] Yeah.
[388.58 → 389.58] Yeah.
[389.58 → 390.58] Here we go.
[390.58 → 391.58] We, we have made it.
[391.58 → 395.58] Chris XLX Cross, I believe is the name of the guy that posted on the forum.
[395.58 → 398.58] And he had a suggestion and that was Play Claw.
[398.58 → 400.58] Uh, you can find it by going to playclaw.com.
[400.58 → 403.58] I checked it out very briefly by looking at the video and stuff.
[403.58 → 404.58] Fairly interesting.
[404.58 → 408.58] Um, I haven't actually installed it, but it's fairly interesting.
[408.58 → 412.58] And the, the guy that made Riva Tuner, which you guys can see on screen right now and still
[412.58 → 417.58] maintains it, has basically said he's busy working on a bunch of other stuff.
[417.58 → 420.58] And while this is in his pipeline, it's very low priority in his pipeline.
[420.58 → 421.58] So it will be done eventually.
[421.58 → 430.58] Um, but as there's not a ton of 64-bit required games, um, it's just, it's just not a huge deal
[430.58 → 431.58] right now.
[431.58 → 436.58] He's focusing on other stuff like prepping for, um, the Hawaii cards, which he's still, I'm
[436.58 → 439.58] refining things for, and NVIDIA's new stuff that's coming out.
[439.58 → 443.58] 780 Ti, which we get to talk about slightly, although we know nothing about it.
[443.58 → 447.58] So slightly is basically what I just said.
[447.58 → 450.58] It kind of exists and that's, yeah.
[450.58 → 452.58] So moving on from Riva Tuner.
[452.58 → 455.58] Blizzard All-Stars, now Heroes of the Storm.
[455.58 → 462.58] I love this topic because they basically said nothing in the biggest possible way.
[462.58 → 464.58] But it's kind of Blizzard style.
[464.58 → 467.58] It's really not something you should be confused about if you are used to them.
[467.58 → 468.58] Mm-hmm.
[468.58 → 469.58] You know, a little name change.
[469.58 → 470.58] That's all we're doing.
[470.58 → 472.58] You know, a little, they don't really rush anything.
[472.58 → 474.58] Um, but I'm extremely, extremely excited.
[474.58 → 475.58] I think it's going to be really cool.
[475.58 → 478.58] One thing that I liked actually is that the video for this, if you want to bring it up.
[478.58 → 479.58] Yep.
[479.58 → 485.58] Is, um, created by this, what is it, Carbon Animations.
[485.58 → 490.58] It's not even like a super crazy, they didn't spend tons of crazy amounts of money.
[490.58 → 494.58] They probably threw him something, and it's just kind of awesome.
[494.58 → 495.58] Go to play the video for him.
[495.58 → 499.58] I'm going to make sure it's not way too astronomically loud for anybody.
[499.58 → 502.58] Oh, oh, there we go.
[502.58 → 506.58] Oh, oh, there we go.
[506.58 → 507.58] I mean!
[507.58 → 523.58] I'm kidding!
[523.58 → 528.58] You have to miss your consciences.
[528.58 → 533.58] Mm-hmm.
[533.58 → 535.58] Yes!
[535.58 → 536.58] Yes!
[536.58 → 537.20] Hamm.
[538.04 → 538.58] Ha!
[539.96 → 540.86] OUR deal
[541.12 → 541.78] H 선생님
[545.44 → 546.44] He R U land
[548.56 → 550.16] Br seconds
[561.22 → 563.84] Apparently, the sound was way out of sync but you guys got the point.
[563.84 → 568.00] it's not exactly a super complicated video they just basically show some heroes and then heroes
[568.00 → 573.30] of the storm is now a thing so they're going to be showing that off at blazon yeah so this
[573.30 → 577.06] blazon is actually going to be pretty intense yeah I would if is you could pick any blazon to go to
[577.06 → 581.66] this would be the one i I would love to go to blazon this year because you've got you've got
[581.66 → 586.88] hearthstone which is like going to be huge I'm having tons of fun with hearthstone it's going to be huge
[586.88 → 590.66] and it's one thing with hearthstone that's interesting is like okay there's magic which is
[590.66 → 596.08] massive, but it has all the people that are already into card games I think hearthstone is
[596.08 → 600.26] going to bring people into card games that have never played card games before exactly and people
[600.26 → 604.18] from the warcraft universe such as us, you know talk about vanilla wow we'll get into that a
[604.18 → 609.50] little bit yeah, but guys like us who played a lot of warcrafts you know warcraft I wish I played two
[609.50 → 614.70] yeah it's sad to say I only played three so warcraft three and sunk a lot of time into world of
[614.70 → 620.30] warcraft especially vanilla wow burning crusade stuff like that um it really pulls us in and i
[620.30 → 624.02] remember we were talking you know the artwork is fantastic yeah as we're used to just being in
[624.02 → 629.26] the blizzard universe you're starting to read one of the novels I'm I'm three novels in right now
[629.26 → 633.70] uh Vancouver an event we went to that actually gave away blizzard novels yeah so read the first
[633.70 → 637.96] free one ended up buying two more um going down to the states tomorrow to do some shopping I'll be
[637.96 → 643.38] buying at least three is my plan so you know the war the warcraft universe is really, really cool
[643.38 → 647.74] perfect lore, and it's like you said it's pulling in the guys that have played card games before
[647.74 → 651.52] and the guys who haven't you know the guys who are used to magic and the guys who are used to
[651.52 → 659.14] uh warcraft and who are in the blizzard universe lots of money oh seriously and then like it pulls
[659.14 → 663.88] in the warcraft fans like us like we both really like the lore, and we've played the games both
[663.88 → 669.18] versions kind of the game the RTS and the MMO um, and then you jump into the card game, and you're
[669.18 → 674.68] like oh everything's familiar it's not scary I'm putting down raid leaders and Murdoch like this is fine
[674.68 → 679.20] and then the people that are into card games the names of the cards aren't very important
[679.20 → 685.40] exactly not at all pre-knowing warcraft is not important at all so jumping into hearthstone is
[685.40 → 691.96] actually not difficult to do and quite easy it's its I also find it much more uh noob friendly than
[691.96 → 699.14] something like uh magic because magic is really deep and really complicated and there's like so many
[699.14 → 705.72] ridiculous layers of strategy and of course there is with hearthstone still but the um ease of
[705.72 → 711.36] entry and learning how to start I don't find to be that difficult yeah um so that's basically all we
[711.36 → 717.90] really have for blizzard all-stars is there's a name yeah hooray there's a name and something we
[717.90 → 722.78] mentioned it's the first time they've done anything except for star craft warcraft or Pablo
[722.78 → 727.68] yeah even though they're pulling off those the universe you know we mentioned like a mixture
[727.68 → 732.80] but it is a different game you have to understand this is one of the biggest companies to exist that
[732.80 → 737.90] has essentially three titles that have all existed for since the 90s well one thing you could
[737.90 → 744.00] say that warcraft 3 was a RTS, and then they made a MMO which is that's true that's true that is true
[744.00 → 748.38] but then this one this is the first time they've had like uh universe crossovers as far as I know other
[748.38 → 752.54] than like joke stuff which they've definitely had, but it was more on such a good point
[752.54 → 756.34] I've never even that's very obvious but I've never made the mental connection because
[756.34 → 761.16] it happened so long ago yeah, and it happened definitely a RTS yeah and definitely went to
[761.16 → 765.46] a MMO there's no it was like the one of the biggest possible changes they could have done yeah
[765.46 → 771.72] but then like it happened so like what was it 2004 I want to say I think it was 2004 for vanilla
[771.72 → 778.40] wow 2006 for burning crusade or no, no no, no burning crusade was definitely later 2007 I want to say
[778.40 → 784.34] it was pre-2008 was it pre-2008 yeah because I know 2005 was the year I graduated, and we were
[784.34 → 788.20] definitely playing warcraft then and when I went to school we were still playing warcraft and I was
[788.20 → 795.56] still rating MC, and you know BWL and all that kind of stuff so yeah it must have been somewhere around
[795.56 → 802.40] 2008 2000 maybe later 2007 I'm pretty sure about that I want to I just want to know just because I'm
[802.40 → 807.00] interested because it ties into a topic later on so the release date in North America for the actual
[807.00 → 814.94] full game was 2004 that makes a lot of sense and then burning crusade was oh snap burning crusade was
[814.94 → 822.56] January 2007 and wrath of like came was November 2008 January 2007 yeah okay beginning of 2007 yeah
[822.56 → 828.30] okay that makes sense um so yeah it's actually quite old now you're looking at almost 10 years yeah
[828.30 → 835.82] because it's the recent 2004 it's 2013 now that's actually pretty ridiculous um I'm going to jump one
[835.82 → 839.78] because I think that could be a lot no we'll actually do that right now um apple is pushing up
[839.78 → 846.14] resolutions so let's jump to bring that up on your screen I'll bring that up, so apple is with their
[846.14 → 852.18] Apple TV going to be pushing 4k soon, and they're basically doing a resolution refresh or not necessarily
[852.18 → 857.60] refresh a're pushing resolutions pretty hard on devices pretty much all across the board
[857.60 → 863.00] so this is pretty interesting it's from uh mac rumours I believe the person who posted on the forum
[863.00 → 869.72] was Kiruna I hope I'm saying that right uh that would be my guess yeah it's posted on Mac rumours and
[869.72 → 876.30] honestly just like a lot of the like computer hardware sites if it's posted on Mac rumours it's usually
[876.30 → 881.74] pretty correct or pretty close to correct so I wouldn't be surprised so you can see on their Apple TV
[881.74 → 889.24] 55 inch and 65 inch 4k that's beast that is I'm happy to see it and now a lot of people in the
[889.24 → 895.42] audience are I'm sure if I check twitch chat right now wherever it is um apple wow what the hell why
[895.42 → 901.52] is this apple um I'm not going to buy one I'm not interested in buying one I'm not interested in
[901.52 → 906.70] buying one either but I already know what you're going to say I'll, I'll let you lead into it it's its
[906.70 → 911.34] gonna push all the people who I'm going to buy stuff from to make it better exactly which is the thing
[911.34 → 915.66] that I like about apple and which is why I like them hanging around is because the longer they're
[915.66 → 922.18] around the longer they push stuff the longer the stuff I get is not going to suck because we can
[922.18 → 927.46] look at Samsung s3s and how much plastic is in this but I don't think something like the htc1
[927.46 → 932.38] would have ever come around if it wasn't for an iPhone yeah absolutely because we'd
[932.38 → 937.36] have more plastique cheap stuff which is good because we can afford it there's still the debate
[937.36 → 942.64] because we this is something we flexibility thing we agree on many of things one thing we disagree
[942.64 → 948.40] on is this back yeah you just like it, I like it, I like the one of my main problems with this back
[948.40 → 953.94] is that there's not very many clips so it is just like it comes off way too easy like I don't even have
[953.94 → 965.90] to try in the slightest one thing I noticed with some other phone that I don't have it's a little
[965.90 → 974.76] bit is maybe if it's maybe more difficult in theory it could be possibly more difficult to take off
[974.76 → 984.94] if you were to do that if that was a thing if you have done that that may um apple anyway it's i
[984.94 → 988.88] think it's good what they're doing but just to get I'm gonna I'm gonna now can't reach it too far
[988.88 → 993.56] the thing is when I bought my s3 I have an otter box case on it not the crazy one I don't even remember
[993.56 → 1000.14] the name but I can't use my phone without that otter box case on you know so the back to me that's
[1000.14 → 1005.38] just where we differ you like to have no case with my day job i have to have a case on that thing
[1005.38 → 1009.82] yeah I used to carry a case it's just a different when I went to school and stuff I had a case if
[1009.82 → 1014.90] you're going to go no case I personally think the htc1 it could be just a better way to go although
[1014.90 → 1018.84] you lose the functionality of changing out the battery and the SD cards like I love the fact that
[1018.84 → 1023.34] with Samsung phones you can just take that off I have an extra battery in my backpack at all times
[1023.34 → 1031.38] I tried that's another thing I tried to um swap the battery on this phone I don't know if you
[1031.38 → 1034.90] remember that I tried to swap the battery because I thought that was the problem with my phone having
[1034.90 → 1041.14] so many battery problems and then uh that didn't help then I went on cyanogen mod and that helped
[1041.14 → 1045.72] the best thing ever so because even though you can't change the battery you can still go cyanogen mod on
[1045.72 → 1052.46] htc1 that's true so I would almost see that would be a like bigger improvement actually um just one
[1052.46 → 1060.32] second this actually go live yes it did um yeah where's Timmy is he supposed to be calling us or
[1060.32 → 1065.72] uh I thought you said five o'clock right I believe you said five originally yeah I thought he was just
[1065.72 → 1070.90] going to hang out in the channel I was hoping so he's he's he's been too many ways there's the shout-out
[1070.90 → 1076.64] for Timmy so he's hopefully coming back, but we are going to jump onto the next topic for now
[1076.64 → 1082.32] secure U.S. government numbers leaked on 4chan it's like the scariest title
[1082.32 → 1089.10] I've read in so long 4chan will never quit it's its yeah it's just yeah, so this is from anime
[1089.10 → 1097.06] wolf kid um and the article is found on daily caller something do do yeah daily caller.com
[1097.06 → 1103.14] and basically numbers were leaked like a while ago and then leaked again recently and the numbers
[1103.14 → 1108.14] include this is a long list so give me a second the White House situation room the direct line to
[1108.14 → 1113.04] the U.S. department of state operations centre senior watch officer that's the longest thing ever
[1113.04 → 1119.18] um the national military command centre at the pentagon the U.S. strategic command bunker the
[1119.18 → 1125.38] campus alert facility the operations room for the national airborne operations centre the raven rock
[1125.38 → 1133.68] mountain complex the active control room of the 91st operations group the 740th missile squadron
[1133.68 → 1141.94] and the Kirtland underground munition storage complex that's a lot of things, so the numbers were
[1141.94 → 1148.64] originally posted on September 13th, and they reposted on October the 13th, and basically it's ridiculous
[1148.64 → 1155.74] it's 4chan so what they did is they called in, and they asked about battle toads because it's 4chan
[1155.74 → 1162.90] what do you want them to do so expect really yeah I was actually kind of this is going to sound
[1162.90 → 1168.48] bad you shouldn't call the pentagon but when I read this and I was like they asked for
[1168.48 → 1173.78] battle toads I was kind of happy because I was like the internet's never really going to change we're always
[1173.78 → 1178.18] going to want more battle toads yeah we're always going to ask for more battle toads will always
[1178.18 → 1182.84] be in demand they will be this is something we know yeah one of my comments here is I love how people
[1182.84 → 1186.50] received information like this and their knee-jerk reaction was to ask about battle toads
[1186.50 → 1191.12] because that's like the first thing they do after they get it is oh do you have battle toads it's
[1191.12 → 1196.32] like what there's no way um anyway that was pretty awesome if you guys want to hear I think there's
[1196.32 → 1201.28] three of the recordings were posted online on diazo or whatever so if you want to hear those if you
[1201.28 → 1205.06] check out the wan show document which will be in the description of this video after it is uploaded
[1205.06 → 1209.78] as an archive on YouTube you can check that out and in there's the three links to hear the
[1209.78 → 1215.44] recordings uh two of them don't have the other line recorded so they're kind of boring and that
[1215.44 → 1220.38] dude just asked about uh battle toads the third guy has the other line recorded but all you can hear
[1220.38 → 1226.68] from him is uh he's a little bit hard to understand i, and he has a pretty heavy accent, and then he says
[1226.68 → 1232.86] like a bunch of code words so it sounds super serious and then just hangs up um is Timmy in the
[1232.86 → 1242.18] team speak now Timmy is in the team speak there we go hello timmy
[1242.18 → 1251.12] hey how's it going there we go we can hear do you have your headphones I do one second Timmy
[1251.12 → 1259.80] I am here sorry guys I should have had this ready oh it's all good um do do do
[1259.80 → 1268.38] all right Timmy do you want to introduce yourself tell people where they can find you tell them who
[1268.38 → 1275.90] you are what you do what's a YouTube blah blah blah so I'm just a small YouTube channel um this is a
[1275.90 → 1282.36] hobby it's Timmy tech TV up on YouTube so it's you forward slash Timmy tech TV um and mainly I'm trying
[1282.36 → 1292.46] to do unboxing of stuff and more from a user perspective you know rather than I don't know i
[1292.46 → 1297.80] guess the Polish that you guys put on stuff i just kind of do it as a hobby, and it's mostly stuff that
[1297.80 → 1305.40] I buy or that you know I build for people as a system builder so that's cool um sorry we're fooling
[1305.40 → 1311.16] around there a little bit uh all right so we're going to jump into our first topic
[1311.16 → 1319.10] do do which Timmy chose and that is the r9 290x launch has been postponed now I found this
[1319.10 → 1323.20] pretty interesting because one of Timmy's tweets actually made it into the article so make sure you
[1323.20 → 1328.16] bring up both there we're going to jump to the laptop screen and basically as you can see right
[1328.16 → 1332.42] there Timmy's tweet down there at the bottom um it's been delayed a bunch what do you have
[1332.42 → 1338.14] to say about this uh first I'm famous and I didn't even know it until I saw the link you posted there
[1338.14 → 1347.14] but um the I think this is a game of one seamanship I think um that maybe AMD found out
[1347.14 → 1354.56] that NVIDIA was hosting that event this weekend and decided to hold off um you know this is a lot of
[1354.56 → 1360.12] leaks have come out about you know how it compares to the 780 when it's in quiet mode
[1360.12 → 1366.62] right I'm curious I'm just kind of curious if they're going to want everybody to rerun
[1366.62 → 1374.38] against the 780 ti before they release the embargo that's not a bad point because it's been really
[1374.38 → 1379.34] confusing from the reviewer's end because like we get this card, and they're like yeah here's your
[1379.34 → 1385.44] release date and then right before the release date it's like nope don't do it this is your
[1385.44 → 1389.40] new release nope this is your new nope this is your new release date it's like what are you doing
[1389.40 → 1395.50] stop um yeah well and i thought it was fascinating that they actually let the one
[1395.50 → 1403.70] stat come out but nothing else yeah the one stat going out nothing else, and then they're going to have a
[1403.70 → 1407.98] not necessarily hands-on as in I don't know if people can use it, but they have that event coming up
[1407.98 → 1415.82] the public event right by the NVIDIA event that's going on right now like that's ballsy i yeah i
[1415.82 → 1420.66] thought that was actually really awesome to be honest with you because usually it's video trolling
[1420.66 → 1427.20] AMD yeah so I thought the uh hey we're just going to set up it across the street from you and show you how
[1427.20 → 1431.86] awesome ac4 looks and 4k you know surround
[1431.86 → 1438.00] yeah it's kind of cool I thought that was pretty crazy, and then they had 780s there too
[1438.00 → 1444.12] so you could see the 290x, and then you could see a 780 playing the same game so like that was
[1444.12 → 1448.26] really aggressive in my opinion because they could have gone with just their card and been like
[1448.26 → 1454.18] look how well it works but no right beside the NVIDIA event that is press only they had an open to
[1454.18 → 1459.04] the public event where you could see both cards so like they're doing this stuff behind doors we'll do
[1459.04 → 1463.10] it right here I think it's what Timmy said they're just one upping each other yeah you know to make
[1463.10 → 1467.12] another star craft analogy because that's all I seem to do you know they're seeing their
[1467.12 → 1470.52] opponent take a third base well I'll take a fourth I'll take you know I'll take a fifth I'll take more
[1470.52 → 1474.96] I'll do this you know I'm going to sit back a little bit I'm going to grow stronger and stronger and stronger
[1474.96 → 1479.06] before we end up you know really getting into it and really start swinging at each other
[1479.06 → 1484.06] but what a cool idea out to the public here's theirs here's ours, and it's interesting
[1484.06 → 1491.24] no go I was going to say to be fair that from what I heard from people is that there was somebody at
[1491.24 → 1496.84] the door asking people if they were media and then gently reminding them that NVIDIA did invite them
[1496.84 → 1502.84] and they shouldn't come in so they weren't like hey all you media guys come on over, and you know
[1502.84 → 1508.92] check this out that's interesting that's kind of cool yeah some respect there for sure that is
[1508.92 → 1514.50] actually pretty cool to be honest um it's yeah the whole one-upping thing I was actually pretty
[1514.50 → 1519.78] surprised at the 780 ti announcement yeah no kidding when people were talking about rumours going
[1519.78 → 1525.76] on that were about stuff that was going to come out of this NVIDIA event I expected uh other ti series
[1525.76 → 1530.48] for the 700 series to be announced the 780 ti I wasn't sure if they had it sitting there or not
[1530.48 → 1537.06] because the 780 and titan are actually pretty close to be completely honest and the 780 ti segment
[1537.06 → 1542.54] might make a lot of sense especially if they do a price drop on 780 so they're uh more competitive
[1542.54 → 1546.16] or whatever so it's going to be interesting what's happening now because NVIDIA basically is sitting
[1546.16 → 1552.28] there with this card that as far as I know no one has yet going you don't know what this is yeah you're
[1552.28 → 1556.74] about to release your new big card what if this crushes you yeah, and it puts AMD in a pretty awkward
[1556.74 → 1563.12] spot but then AMD responds by going here everybody try it whatever so it's going to be fascinating
[1563.12 → 1568.52] the GPU wars were kind of dead there for a little while if people watched our streams from back when
[1568.52 → 1573.60] we were in the garage you could probably see it was just dominated the dim and grim let's be honest
[1573.60 → 1579.04] yeah yeah we were pretty much just talking about like will AMD still be a company next well
[1579.04 → 1582.94] last time we were on the show we were saying you know AIDS you know they're really picking up some
[1582.94 → 1587.84] some speed I remember talking about that they're really coming together and in the few weeks it
[1587.84 → 1593.06] hasn't even been that long you've seen incredible developments and what we both said was you know we
[1593.06 → 1598.76] feel like NVIDIA is really the big guys and just like we're talking about with apple you know we
[1598.76 → 1605.10] want them to push the industry AMD is now absolutely pushing the industry whether if you're a fan of AMD
[1605.10 → 1610.66] obviously that's great if you're not a fan of AMD that's also great that's great yeah this is a win-win
[1610.66 → 1616.58] for consumers yep because stuff like 780ti will actually become a thing now exactly what are you
[1616.58 → 1622.32] you know and the other thing is there's a lot of you know any reviewer gets accused of this oh
[1622.32 → 1628.24] you're a know NVIDIA fanboy oh you're an AMD fanboy in my personal systems I tend to use more
[1628.24 → 1634.62] NVIDIA parts but for friends and family I tend to recommend more AMD parts and for everybody in
[1634.62 → 1640.76] general you know people need to realize a strong AMD makes NVIDIA better and a strong AMD makes intel
[1640.76 → 1645.12] better because they can't sit on their hands and not give us the products that they've been
[1645.12 → 1649.48] developing for the last five years absolutely it's a perfect point so if they do better on
[1649.48 → 1653.52] the GPU side that will hopefully just have more money flowing through the company in general
[1653.52 → 1659.72] and will help the CPU side too so this is actually just generally just it's all wins for us yeah it's
[1659.72 → 1665.28] literally good what's going on yeah for the consumers and especially who knows if that 780ti was meant
[1665.28 → 1670.78] to be an 800 series card and they pulled it back a generation just to compete exactly whether it was
[1670.78 → 1674.84] like an 870 or that is not something I would have thought of that's fascinating its they do
[1674.84 → 1679.46] that a lot though they'll take a make a slightly higher tier card, and they'll drop it down one tier
[1679.46 → 1683.64] and then just release it in the next series so that's actually a perfect point it could have been
[1683.64 → 1689.46] what we were looking at for the 870 or something like that, but we have no idea um more at the NVIDIA
[1689.46 → 1697.20] event uh NVIDIA g-sync s-y-n-c this is pretty crazy when I first read the article about it on
[1697.20 → 1705.26] um video cards.com if you can jump that right so nope up it's in the guest topics
[1705.26 → 1714.08] right there um so when I first read this I was like oh that's pretty cool but no one's gonna care
[1714.08 → 1719.32] because you're locked down to NVIDIA setup and like who knows what's actually gonna work where
[1719.32 → 1723.16] and it's so proprietary it's locked down blah blah blah and those were all the immediate thoughts
[1723.16 → 1728.14] that came to my mind um and whatever improvements it could be and I read about how it's its syncing
[1728.14 → 1732.24] the refresh rate with how your graphics card is performing at the time, and it's supposed to make
[1732.24 → 1735.74] it is smoother and stuff and I was like ah it's basically making the refresh rate dynamic would
[1735.74 → 1741.52] that be a good way to yeah yeah um but I was wondering like I was just saying like how much is
[1741.52 → 1746.36] that really going to do yeah like is that really going to help it that much and how much is it gonna cost in
[1746.36 → 1749.26] the end then how much is it going to cost you because you got to invest in this new monitor
[1749.26 → 1754.02] because it's not gonna it's its built into the monitor and by in the end I mean you know when you
[1754.02 → 1758.92] eventually take that like we do you know when that system becomes you know split up into two other
[1758.92 → 1765.32] systems or whatever happens how is that going to work yeah, yeah so i was pretty drawn back about
[1765.32 → 1769.42] this and then I got a call from Linus those of you that were watching the pre-show know that
[1769.42 → 1774.82] happened and I was kind of wondering what he was on about um it was g-sync, and he has used it and in
[1774.82 → 1782.32] his words he is where is it he is completely mind blown, and he gushed pretty hardcore while he's on
[1782.32 → 1788.80] the phone and his comparative was you go watch a movie, and it looks really, really good, but it's at a
[1788.80 → 1792.48] much lower frame rate than what you're used to it's at less than half usually because it's usually
[1792.48 → 1799.04] running about 24 fps, and we're gonna just consider that everyone's running at 60 fps in games all the
[1799.04 → 1804.12] time which is really not something we could do but whatever everyone's running at 60 fps all the time
[1804.12 → 1811.34] um this is supposed to make it seem more like a movie it's supposed to be way more smooth because
[1811.34 → 1817.62] the refresh rate of your monitor will adaptively change to your GPU, so there won't be as much
[1817.62 → 1822.72] tearing there won't be as much chopping it'll be much smoother no matter what happens and coming from
[1822.72 → 1827.18] Linus's mouth saying he's completely mind blown is a huge deal I can't really say much else
[1827.18 → 1832.24] other than Linus said he was completely mind blown because I haven't seen it you had it on speakerphone yeah
[1832.24 → 1838.00] he was extremely excited that's I just want to emphasize that he was very excited sounded very
[1838.00 → 1842.72] genuinely impressed he was not on a stream you know he didn't have that energy of trying to be on
[1842.72 → 1848.22] camera he was just talking to you on the phone and was was was very excited it's its it's probably the
[1848.22 → 1852.88] most mind blown I've ever heard him what are you going to say to me, I caught a little of the stream this
[1852.88 → 1858.96] morning and especially the after kind of the after event where they had the panel but right before that
[1858.96 → 1865.46] he walked over to Tim and Tim was just had walked over to one of those uh g-sync uh computer systems
[1865.46 → 1870.88] and you could see him like messing around your know like he made it the absolute worst case it could be
[1870.88 → 1876.54] yeah, and you could once in a while see a little tiny and that's real time you know rendering on that
[1876.54 → 1882.52] display yeah you every once in a while you could see a little tiny jitter where if you could
[1882.52 → 1887.02] tell that the frame rate was dropping a little bit, but it wasn't going all the way down, but you could
[1887.02 → 1895.74] always read the text that was on the pendulum, and if there was never any tearing if you really paid
[1895.74 → 1900.96] attention you could see it down shifting in frames but right never saw tearing you never saw artifacts
[1900.96 → 1906.22] so I can see why he's excited about it, I think the same thing that you guys already said which is
[1906.22 → 1912.96] you know I'm scared that this is another one of those proprietary you know products where you know i
[1912.96 → 1919.30] have a 30 inch IPS panel yeah do I want to pay you know a thousand dollars for another 30 inch IPS panel
[1919.30 → 1926.52] just so that I can use this um so that's kind of scary but if they can talk you know TV manufacturers
[1926.52 → 1934.18] into shipping with that part it's a huge win and there was something in the stream and I may have
[1934.18 → 1939.42] misheard them, but they seem to allude to it was a product that they were going to license
[1939.42 → 1947.56] as well so I don't know if that means that you know what that means, but oh are you saying as in
[1947.56 → 1955.68] that AMD could utilize it uh because I wouldn't go that far, but they seem to allude to that it was
[1955.68 → 1961.06] like because physics there are some things that the two companies do where they do share the
[1961.06 → 1966.28] technology because it's better for you know all of pc sales right even though they don't really want
[1966.28 → 1971.40] you to know that they do every once in a while work together for the betterment of everybody you
[1971.40 → 1978.40] know all the users yeah, but it'd be interesting to see if that's the tact you know who knows you know
[1978.40 → 1983.98] two three years down the road if you know is NVIDIA adopts something like mantle or two three years down
[1983.98 → 1988.68] the road that AMD adopts something like g-sync it's its going to be pretty interesting one thing
[1988.68 → 1996.52] to note with this too is um as a complete I have two uh pa248 is big IPS panels and I know you just
[1996.52 → 2003.32] said you had a 30 inch IPS panel this will only be working on TN yeah that was the other thing yeah
[2003.32 → 2010.10] so while I'm excited about it and all the guys that have those like super quick BenQ monitors that
[2010.10 → 2013.82] they're using the light boost trick and all that kind of stuff on I think those guys would be really
[2013.82 → 2022.22] interested in that but um IPS lovers I don't know I'm still not completely sold because if I have to
[2022.22 → 2029.02] go buy a TN panel I'm just going to look at it and be sad all the time to be like why does this exist
[2029.02 → 2036.18] I really felt like when I saw this it was like wow that's an awesome technology and there's like a
[2036.18 → 2043.60] 50 chance it's DOA yeah yeah there's a pretty big chance who's going to use it other than you know
[2043.60 → 2049.42] high-end gamers you know we'll see what else they can do with it, you know if they can work
[2049.42 → 2056.38] you know because TVs they may put this in TVs at some point right and if is that is part of
[2056.38 → 2062.34] you know like the whole streaming experience right so now you could stream to your TV and not just your
[2062.34 → 2068.60] shield then it makes a lot of sense but I think they're just going into the TN panels honestly to
[2068.60 → 2073.28] start there and get a footprint and then I think you're going to see it yeah I think you're going
[2073.28 → 2077.60] to see it distributed more widely at some point but I'm wondering if there's some type of technical
[2077.60 → 2082.54] limitation because there's actually quite a big difference between TN and IPS panels um less of
[2082.54 → 2089.56] which between IPS and pls in my mind just how it kind of works um because they are a lot faster
[2089.56 → 2093.20] so I wonder if that's part of has something to do with the refresh rate switching
[2093.20 → 2097.92] but maybe that's something they can fix in the end they did say that they've been working on this
[2097.92 → 2104.24] for about five years yeah, yeah so that's that's actually quite interesting it'll, it'll be really
[2104.24 → 2108.10] interesting to see what's going on with g-sync hopefully we get a sample here so we can try it
[2108.10 → 2113.98] out and do some videos on it because with our slo-mo camera we could show comparisons between a g-sync
[2113.98 → 2119.28] monitor and a non-g-sync monitor in the same situations yeah hopefully I know there are a few games
[2119.28 → 2124.38] actually that I can make tear because I know certain parts that are hard for it so if I jump
[2124.38 → 2128.60] and turn in the right motion I'll see it tear like crazy so I'll try and show g-sync comparative
[2128.60 → 2133.90] against that and then oh yeah just hopefully we get one so we can show it off because that would be
[2133.90 → 2140.58] really cool um what happened my power cable for my laptop there it is sorry we're probably going to
[2140.58 → 2145.30] jump into more topics than what's just in the guest topic list, but now we should jump up to
[2145.30 → 2152.26] blizzard free at last, so this is fascinating so I think it was a joint venture between the
[2152.26 → 2159.04] company and the CEO and one other guy which is kind of interesting because the CEO and another dude
[2159.04 → 2165.30] paid in a bunch into this but basically put by put up on the forum by each on though
[2165.30 → 2172.86] we're going to jump onto that screen now um blizzard is no longer under Vivaldi
[2172.86 → 2177.96] and this is fascinating because one thing that Richard was actually talking about earlier
[2177.96 → 2184.10] is we were huge fans of vanilla wow and burning crusade and cod for which were all created before
[2184.10 → 2191.14] Vivaldi owned blizzards okay are you ready I'm ready to go for gold those were the best games that were
[2191.14 → 2198.34] vanilla wow it's so much better than any other wild expansions that came out items sets should not be
[2198.34 → 2205.24] four pieces I wear four pieces of clothing that are not a set I go together sets should be eight pieces
[2205.24 → 2211.96] tier 0.5 is amazing tier 0.5 is what you get from going into five men and some pieces you need
[2211.96 → 2217.78] from a 10-man dungeon that was called users you got a tier 0.5 and why you did that is because you
[2217.78 → 2224.20] went and got your tier 0.5 so that you could say to this guild that goes hardcore that does work in
[2224.20 → 2229.00] 40 man raid and says you know what I'm a decent candidate for your guild because I have gathered
[2229.00 → 2235.28] my tier 0.5 gear I know what I'm doing and I'm getting myself into if it's not all purple because
[2235.28 → 2241.00] purple is supposed to be rare and things that are rare means not everyone has them I know video games
[2241.00 → 2247.78] are trying to teach kids differently these days but rare means scarce not extraordinarily common
[2247.78 → 2253.40] which games are kind of sorry Timmy I'm kind of going on a bit of a rant here but vanilla
[2253.40 → 2260.30] and 40 man raids the way that loot was done the difficulty was insane people used to go against MC for
[2260.30 → 2266.94] weeks before you know you could finish molten core and BWL oh my goodness you know the dragons in there
[2266.94 → 2271.54] the coordination of the very I'm I'm I'm embarrassing myself because I don't remember the very first
[2271.54 → 2277.72] dragon but the coordination of the fight the hunters literally running around the outside pulling dragons
[2277.72 → 2282.62] with them ads and everyone was in different locations the difficulty the very first boss the
[2282.62 → 2287.80] very first you just walk in the door, and they're like here you go maybe in a month maybe in a month
[2287.80 → 2292.50] we'll practice enough to get this done because you cannot just walk through the door press three
[2292.50 → 2297.70] macros be on your second monitor watching YouTube and still win it doesn't work like that anymore
[2297.70 → 2304.62] cod 4 is the best call of duty ever made I think some people will debate you about cod 2 versus that
[2304.62 → 2309.36] but that would be a good argument that would be an argument in which I would disagree but respect
[2309.36 → 2317.32] the other side if you argue black ops or something like that this is the thing in one thing from my
[2317.32 → 2322.14] casting I'm getting a little more energetic now but in my casting I do take punctual opinions
[2322.14 → 2325.54] something I've a little stayed a little bit away from in my last time but on this one i definitely
[2325.54 → 2332.82] will cod 4 was the last time Call of Duty has also had dedicated servers now I hope everyone in the pc
[2332.82 → 2337.44] world am I right about that I think they're no I don't necessarily modern warfare 2 did not
[2337.44 → 2341.72] um, but they might have gone back to that now that I'm thinking about it, they might have gone back to
[2341.72 → 2346.86] it I think there's been a one at least I think there's been at least one since cod 4 the twitch chat will
[2346.86 → 2352.16] tell me we're waiting on the twitch we'll have to see um OG black ops did yeah I remember yeah i
[2352.16 → 2359.18] was going to say yeah black ops 2 sorry my problem is I fell off the bones and I did not yeah but they
[2359.18 → 2365.64] was they changed it over from dedicated servers to modern warfare 2 had the same matchmaking Xbox
[2365.64 → 2374.82] terrible that was feels bad can't customize the game has bad hosting has a so many more limits um I know
[2374.82 → 2378.38] we used to play on one server in cod 4 specifically where you could take a helicopter down with a
[2378.38 → 2382.96] single bullet yeah because they just didn't want the helicopter in the game which if you feel like
[2382.96 → 2386.38] playing with no helicopters jump on their server you feel like playing a different way jump on their
[2386.38 → 2391.76] server, and it was just it was excellent I apologize I did by the time black ops came around I'm I'm just
[2391.76 → 2395.70] off the boat yeah, so someone said uh i never actually played modern warfare 3 but apparently
[2395.70 → 2399.88] modern warfare 3 also had unranked servers, but it's like I don't know the server support and the
[2399.88 → 2405.28] customizability was also at a different level I think I also liked how I don't really it was it
[2405.28 → 2410.82] was more simple it was more of a counterstrike idea um in the manner that not everything
[2410.82 → 2418.60] exploded and not everything was fireworks and flying this blowing up that dogs and there's just um i
[2418.60 → 2426.04] remember when I was learning website design I want to say in like 2000 everything was like two flashy
[2426.04 → 2431.58] and blah, but we were told not to Hollywood in class she made our teacher our tech teacher made a
[2431.58 → 2438.34] very specific point of saying do not flashy everywhere, or you will lose marks, and you know keep it keep
[2438.34 → 2444.18] it is simple and simplistic and that's something that cod 4 did I think the best uh just an unbelievable
[2444.18 → 2450.62] very meticulous uh very good gameplay but I'm going to breathe for a second I'm going to let Timmy talk
[2450.62 → 2458.72] I'm uh I'm uh so I like Call of Duty 4 but 2 was my favourite you play 2 and veteran was awesome
[2458.72 → 2465.18] where it's a one where it was a one shot and if you could get through that that campaign mode in
[2465.18 → 2473.16] veteran you were the boss because there were some parts where the Nazis were just cool uh the trench
[2473.16 → 2478.76] warfare in that game is like I went to bed at night like having nightmares about you know being in world
[2478.76 → 2485.86] war 2 but the uh i so I was I had to mute myself because I was laughing about the wow stuff so i
[2485.86 → 2492.78] was a day one wow guy um you know 40 man raids um you know doing the five mans where it's like
[2492.78 → 2498.52] oh I have three of the four pieces can I please join your guild yeah they're like nope you have to go
[2498.52 → 2503.54] get the pants right you know yeah yeah, but you know I was a warrior back in those days, and you know
[2503.54 → 2508.74] that was when it was hard mode man that was there was no joking around like you didn't just play for
[2508.74 → 2514.92] a little while I'm like oh look I have bull it was like oh my god a blue yeah yeah yeah get it
[2514.92 → 2518.84] get it I remember when the first dude in our guild got full epics everyone just kind of like stood
[2518.84 → 2524.20] around and was like well the tank from flying shellfish the top rank gill on children which one
[2524.20 → 2529.94] was which was one and I still probably is I think it is one of the best North American servers
[2529.94 → 2536.58] he would, I forget his name oh regardless he would sit in the bank in grammar when there was one
[2536.58 → 2541.82] bank and not two cities in one city um he would sit on the bank and people would just surround him
[2541.82 → 2547.06] because he had all the rare items which were actually rare yeah, and he was the main
[2547.06 → 2553.26] tank and the guild leader of the top ranked guild, and it showed which was awesome oh I know his name
[2553.26 → 2558.94] I don't know what it was back in the days when it was uh you know might was the big you
[2558.94 → 2566.26] know the tier one set yeah than you we always called it the um when you started to get the tier two set
[2566.26 → 2572.30] the wrath set you get all the warriors had the little you know crescent helmet which was hysterical but
[2572.30 → 2580.68] yeah I think so back on topic away from wow I guess yes, yes good idea I'm really excited about the fact
[2580.68 → 2586.88] that they see what's happening the corruption that's happening to their company because
[2586.88 → 2593.46] when you know this is like bungee is no longer a part of Microsoft right yeah this is what happens
[2593.46 → 2601.14] when you have a game studio above you that their only goal is to make money off of you right so you saw
[2601.14 → 2607.00] before where you know it may have taken blizzard 10 years to release something like they were working
[2607.00 → 2613.94] on World of Warcraft for as long as I can remember yep so it I feel like even though they took forever
[2613.94 → 2625.36] on like um uh Diablo 3 that they would have never in that like micro uh transaction system if it had been
[2625.36 → 2632.46] just blizzard yeah right that to me the whole auction house you could use real money to buy things
[2632.46 → 2636.72] in the game was the most ridiculous thing I'd ever seen because I played that game for like 10 minutes it
[2636.72 → 2643.26] was like I'm done I can if I can buy it with real money it's not a real game yeah yeah that drives me
[2643.26 → 2649.40] crazy as well um but i still remember the heyday of you know like when the original star craft
[2649.40 → 2654.76] came out like I still love that game I still go back and play that game it's like the graphics are
[2654.76 → 2661.02] horrible now but the gameplay is just you know wicked yeah it's i actually the first time I ever saw
[2661.02 → 2666.32] star craft before broodmare come out was at a buddy's house you know kind of the old story of you know he had a
[2666.32 → 2670.42] computer and uh I think we had a computer back then, but it wasn't very strong he had a new one
[2670.42 → 2674.64] and uh he went and bought it from Costco or something like that his mom bought it but uh
[2674.64 → 2679.24] and we just played through the single player, and we took turns playing it and I'm actually still
[2679.24 → 2685.56] friends with him um he is a volunteer firefighter at the same hall I'm at so it's kind of cool
[2685.56 → 2691.34] um yeah but that that's where my first star craft experience uh that came from we are gonna work on
[2691.34 → 2697.02] the leg here guys I'm trying to figure it out keep going um but oh and one of the big
[2697.02 → 2702.88] things to me, i glad you kind of sounds like you came from the same roots in these games that uh slick
[2702.88 → 2706.36] and I did and one thing that's really exciting was seeing blizzard on its own as you were saying
[2706.36 → 2712.80] they can make their own choices um is with both of their new games coming out it's its huge now that
[2712.80 → 2717.28] they own themselves, and they're going on this new path with new games i just kind of want
[2717.28 → 2722.76] to find out what you think about that yeah I just think it's you know it's nice to see them go back
[2722.76 → 2729.62] to I guess what I felt like made them a successful company, and you know they're they're the classic
[2729.62 → 2735.30] story of like hey there's a blizzard game coming out and everybody's really really
[2735.30 → 2741.60] excited for it, and they released like you know some 30-second rendered video and then five years
[2741.60 → 2747.40] later the game comes out yeah right yeah, but we always used you know you'd be like oh blizzard
[2747.40 → 2752.90] and then when that game came out one the waiting made it even better but two you knew it was going
[2752.90 → 2758.56] to be good exactly you know even wow with all the technical difficulties they had in like the very early
[2758.56 → 2763.38] days you know and even with the know some of the bugs that were in there it was still
[2763.38 → 2769.62] like mind-blowing better than anything that had come out before absolutely and I think they'll be
[2769.62 → 2774.30] able to go back to that you know if it's the right thing to delay a shipment by six months so that
[2774.30 → 2778.64] they can finish something that they really want in the game now they'll be able to do that again
[2778.64 → 2785.62] exactly and here's an interesting thing uh there's their going to make a warcraft movie um not sure
[2785.62 → 2789.88] if you're aware of that and i I work in the film industry here in vancouver is signed up
[2789.88 → 2793.96] Vancouver is going to be making well not Vancouver is going to be making, but they're going to be making
[2793.96 → 2798.86] the warcraft movie in Vancouver um everyone I work with is very excited to be completely honest
[2798.86 → 2803.80] not many of them play games the reason they're excited is there's a ton of movies being made in
[2803.80 → 2809.94] Vancouver I work I took the day off to do this stream I work a ton um, and it's they are projecting
[2809.94 → 2817.42] that is going to absolutely without a doubt be by significant margin the highest budgeted movie ever
[2817.42 → 2823.36] created in Canada um which is pretty big uh they call Vancouver holly or California north
[2823.36 → 2828.64] yeah um I think we are maybe we're third now but I believe we're second North America
[2828.64 → 2833.20] uh for producing movies and TV shows, so everyone's really excited about that because the budget is
[2833.20 → 2836.96] going to be huge and one thing that I was explaining to them is if it is blizzard running
[2836.96 → 2840.80] it I'm not exactly sure maybe they I hope they didn't sell the rights or something like that but
[2840.80 → 2845.62] if it is blizzard controlling it they will delay this movie until they have decided it is
[2845.62 → 2850.32] perfection which you know what if it takes years I'm okay with that because like you said
[2850.32 → 2856.02] it will be amazing, and it will be worth it yep I think we should probably stop talking about wow now
[2856.02 → 2862.08] because I think we've been talking about wow for 15 minutes uh yeah the chat has renamed this the wow
[2862.08 → 2868.76] show we've yeah I think they've been renaming it the wow show for a little while um I think one of the
[2868.76 → 2874.96] editors at the lioness media group head office is uploading videos right now which is I think maybe why
[2874.96 → 2879.42] we're lagging for the people that are saying we're lagging I'm trying to get in contact with him
[2879.42 → 2885.68] without screaming because that would come through the mic terribly um but I've messaged him he has not
[2885.68 → 2890.98] messaged back hopefully he responds because I'm pretty sure he's uploading videos that he has finished
[2890.98 → 2898.82] rendering and I'm pretty sure that's why we are continually dropping frames so we are lagging um but
[2898.82 → 2908.18] yeah I can't kick him off unfortunately maybe call him call it's i just it's not multiple reasons that i
[2908.18 → 2914.10] can't do it though oh because I don't have my work account linked into this phone yet so I don't have
[2914.10 → 2919.04] his phone number blah blah blah blah I could mute the mic not really actually because of how the new
[2919.04 → 2926.52] audio set of oh yes I can no I can't why is that unplug the snowball, but that could be creative it's not
[2926.52 → 2933.50] the snowball it's that mic that's oh that's right that's right um but yeah hopefully it stops hopefully
[2933.50 → 2938.22] the video is no it's we're definitely lagging we're dropped we're legitimately dropping frames so
[2938.22 → 2943.80] there are frames that the video is recording that are not making it to you guys so while it might not be
[2943.80 → 2948.60] too bad for certain people that probably have better connections um it's definitely dropping frames
[2948.60 → 2954.82] um I can mute this is for someone who just said your audio setup is retarded if you can't mute
[2954.82 → 2960.12] I agree I can't mute because of the mixers on the other side and I can't press the thing and the
[2960.12 → 2964.64] reason why it's over there is because the power cord for the mixer is so ridiculously terrible and low
[2964.64 → 2971.82] quality anyway we're going to move forward if I can find this one um back on the AMD graphics that
[2971.82 → 2977.84] we're talking about earlier AMD graphics gets a massive performance increase in Linux 3.1
[2977.84 → 2984.42] um 0.2 more specifically I believe but this even freaked out and surprised the guys that work on
[2984.42 → 2990.42] the AMD driver for Linux they were like holy crap is this actually real um if you can grab the pc per
[2990.42 → 2998.58] article um basically there's not a lot to say about it apparently um but like pc peers I think this is one
[2998.58 → 3002.92] of the shortest articles I've seen on pc per because one thing I noticed that he likes to do is write
[3002.92 → 3007.66] the longest articles ever but I guess this isn't by the main dude so that makes sense
[3007.66 → 3013.88] um, but basically there's a one to fifty percent improvement in most games and in some select few
[3013.88 → 3020.28] games up to ninety percent improvement on graphics performance like what the hell just happened
[3020.28 → 3025.70] so there's in the game man there's well Linux kernel updates it wasn't even AMD that's the crazy part
[3025.70 → 3033.20] the AMD driver guys were surprised they were like what the heck they're super stoked because it's so
[3033.20 → 3041.90] much better um it was a kernel update that was crazy so in my mind how this went down no idea if
[3041.90 → 3046.52] this is how it actually worked but in my mind how this went down is Linus torsos was pissed at
[3046.52 → 3053.16] NVIDIA and then NVIDIA's like oh we're going to come back now that Dyson valve care about you um and
[3053.16 → 3057.82] he's basically like uh he gave him the finger in a press conference and said
[3057.82 → 3064.26] sorry they were uh Linus torsos yeah yeah yeah gave NVIDIA the finger really and this was a bit ago
[3064.26 → 3069.58] basically saying because NVIDIA is the hardest hardware manufacturer of any hardware manufacturer
[3069.58 → 3074.28] for them to work with really apparently they just refuse to be helpful in any way so Linus torsos
[3074.28 → 3077.34] gave them the finger, and they're like yeah they're incredibly difficult to work with blah blah blah
[3077.34 → 3082.44] they have an independent team that works on their driver and like all this it's crazy um
[3082.44 → 3086.76] and then if he did it's like oh we're coming back because people care about you now and then
[3086.76 → 3093.56] NVIDIA goes and goes oh, but we're going to take support away from the driver for like crazy amounts of GP uh
[3093.56 → 3099.88] monitors and make it three because we don't want to compete with windows too much so I think in my
[3099.88 → 3103.66] mind there must have been something going on behind the scenes and Linus torsos was probably like you
[3103.66 → 3109.90] know what screw you power turtle update boom I hope there's something like that that went down because
[3109.90 → 3115.10] this is awesome what do you think about this well the so the thing I think definitely I think you
[3115.10 → 3122.70] hit the nail on the head there because NVIDIA didn't give a crap about no Linux right and all of a sudden
[3122.70 → 3130.08] the quote-unquote third console is coming out yeah right because steam box it's a pc, but you know let's
[3130.08 → 3136.96] call it the third console yeah from a chip standpoint sure and when they made that decision to go Linux
[3136.96 → 3144.08] all of a sudden they decided to video decided to like oh crap we're going to have a third place that
[3144.08 → 3150.36] our cards and chips aren't going to be yeah I mean imagine the coup would have been if is only AMD would
[3150.36 → 3156.02] have worked that yeah yeah seriously right um people were even worried at the start of the steam machine
[3156.02 → 3161.44] thing because all the pre-done specs for all the steam machines had NVIDIA cards but nope not
[3161.44 → 3165.22] only are they fully modular so you can change it however you want but valve has already said that they
[3165.22 → 3170.04] will be shipping steam machines with AMD cards in them yeah that's what I saw that uh right when it
[3170.04 → 3176.16] came out everybody was like oh my god they're only uh NVIDIA cards and immediately valve comes out and
[3176.16 → 3181.78] goes no, no no, no no that's just what we put in these 300 machines like it's really okay yeah yeah
[3181.78 → 3190.22] that's awesome and then yeah it'll be interesting to see um but i I think you're right I think this is uh
[3190.22 → 3196.04] you know somebody pissed somebody off and somebody decided that they were gonna show
[3196.04 → 3201.88] a certain company what happens when you piss him off yeah yeah exactly if it's your company if you
[3201.88 → 3207.94] are a huge piece of Linux power to you and i absolutely you know what if they're not cooperating
[3207.94 → 3212.90] with you, i you know I try to be a nice guy but if they're not if they're not giving you something
[3212.90 → 3219.82] why should you know it's its it's uh push-pull, and it's super exciting because gaming on Linux
[3219.82 → 3225.12] to be completely honest and i I know there's going to be Linux lovers out there I love Linux deep down
[3225.12 → 3231.24] it's great but honestly guys it wasn't that good gaming on Linux was not that good we could wine
[3231.24 → 3235.92] whatever we wanted um wine was this little application so you could run windows programs and
[3235.92 → 3241.14] stuff, but it was mainly used for games I used to try and run wow through wine, and we can do whatever
[3241.14 → 3247.96] we wanted, but it was really not that good so it's nice that this kind of stuff is happening now
[3247.96 → 3251.76] because it's going to be the performance is going to be there because one thing that Linux has always
[3251.76 → 3256.26] been known for is this beast performance because it's so lightweight so if you get even more like
[3256.26 → 3260.96] this it's just oh that's awesome steam box around the corner steam machine sorry and all this other
[3260.96 → 3266.06] kind of stuff dice backing up Linux like crazy valve backing up Linux like crazy this is good I'm excited
[3266.06 → 3271.00] I'm really excited windows hopefully it works for Microsoft this is awkward windows
[3271.00 → 3275.88] hopefully takes notes and pays a little attention to what's going on, and we're going to switch
[3275.88 → 3282.20] topics because that just got really awkward anyway uh I will say one thing real quick i actually I know
[3282.20 → 3290.50] quite a few people that um you know like me personally I'm going to try to get uh the steam machine to
[3290.50 → 3297.88] run in a VT right in a virtual session yeah because I don't want to you know windows is where most
[3297.88 → 3304.04] people do their productivity right I've used adobe for Linux, and it's junk and I need adobe on my pc
[3304.04 → 3309.98] right I just need that productivity software that does really well on the console that it's or on the
[3309.98 → 3315.36] platform that it's written for the thing where you know but at the same time I don't want to have to
[3315.36 → 3321.64] have two pcs if I have to run you know Linux and windows to do work I just have like a 30 foot
[3321.64 → 3328.16] HDMI cable that runs to my TV and when I want to game uh with my Xbox controller i just you know
[3328.16 → 3334.50] sit down and flip the input over to my TV um you know if I can do that and still be able to switch
[3334.50 → 3341.04] back and forth between uh Linux and windows I think everybody wins in reality because it's going to drive
[3341.04 → 3347.96] pc sales which is good for Microsoft it's going to drive gaming which is good for all of us yeah
[3347.96 → 3355.12] um and it is helps an open platform that you know realistically guys they don't make any money
[3355.12 → 3360.54] off of that open platform I have friends that do open GL and open cl stuff um you know that could be
[3360.54 → 3367.82] making lots of money at NVIDIA or AMD, and they just do it for fun so I used to try now I was terrible so i
[3367.82 → 3372.50] don't even know if I did anything constructive but I used to try and help with the wine project
[3372.50 → 3377.54] um mainly what I would do is testing but yeah like talking to some of the guys in there
[3377.54 → 3381.78] there were some pretty high-end guys that worked for some pretty high-end companies and put in
[3381.78 → 3387.00] beastly amounts of time in their spare time trying to help work all this stuff there's a lot of
[3387.00 → 3391.44] companies out there that aren't profitable really that put towards this open platform movement
[3391.44 → 3395.86] so it's actually quite interesting that it's now becoming it's now likely to become much more
[3395.86 → 3405.14] mainstream um one other thing that I found hilarious that's in here actually I wanted to touch on
[3405.14 → 3409.00] this but I don't I have no idea where this conversation is going to go um it wasn't in
[3409.00 → 3414.18] the guest topics but I wanted to bring it up now problems with journalism now a hilarious reason
[3414.18 → 3419.24] why this is coming up right now is that we okay I slightly screwed up earlier when we're talking about
[3419.24 → 3426.00] the blizzard free at last um the title and what was in that post was a little bit confusing so when i
[3426.00 → 3430.48] skimmed over it I didn't properly read it so it's more Activision that freed itself not
[3430.48 → 3436.54] blizzard specifically it's more specifically Activision so we're going to jump back to the
[3436.54 → 3442.62] next topic which is hilariously the next topic because it's about the sun talking about serif
[3442.62 → 3450.66] industries a company in Deus Ex which made um cybernetic implants so if we jump to your screen
[3450.66 → 3456.96] it's in the newspaper, and they're talking about cybernetic implants from serif industries the best
[3456.96 → 3462.22] part is that it's printed on the thing in the picture serif and if you google it, it's very
[3462.22 → 3467.42] obviously from a game, but they start talking about serif industries there's even well yeah this isn't
[3467.42 → 3472.52] the sun's website right, right yeah, yeah so um so yeah, and they're talking about how it's serif
[3472.52 → 3476.96] industries an U.S. firm blah blah blah has developed an eyeball implant blah blah blah like it's not a
[3476.96 → 3482.96] huge article, but it's just kind of hilarious it's in the sun, but honestly it really shows what a
[3482.96 → 3488.26] joke news is today yeah that's that's we're kind of getting to like personal beliefs right now but i
[3488.26 → 3494.20] have strayed away from listening to the news because you know I'd rather get my fiction from something
[3494.20 → 3499.46] like a warcraft novel you know um like if we look like there was an article that came out saying
[3499.46 → 3506.26] in Toronto started on some forum um what they did do and i I can't remember what level it was but
[3506.26 → 3511.10] um some sort of community soccer where kids just kind of show up and play I'm not sure if it was at
[3511.10 → 3516.42] school or not but they didn't keep score that's that's totally cool that's totally fine
[3516.42 → 3522.64] and then an article came out saying on CBC which if you live in Canada that's kind of our government
[3522.64 → 3528.90] news network um saying that they took the ball away to make it you know no one scores it's like
[3528.90 → 3534.10] they're supposed to imagine that the ball is there not true didn't happen, but someone wrote it
[3534.10 → 3540.28] on the internet and CBC said it was true another thing that happened because breaking bad is really
[3540.28 → 3545.80] popular i thought the CBC thing was an elaborate troll by CBC wasn't an elaborate troll i
[3545.80 → 3552.20] heard they just report it wrong either way because the guys that elaborate troll CBC you should not do
[3552.20 → 3557.94] that you are you should not be trolling you are a nationwide news network I agree so if is you are
[3557.94 → 3562.42] correct shame on them still there was another article that came right out of Vancouver uh this was about
[3562.42 → 3568.10] two weeks ago a RV was driving over one of the many bridges we have it was on fire, and it was
[3568.10 → 3573.72] immediately reported on all the news networks that it was a meth lab on fire why because breaking bad
[3573.72 → 3581.04] just ended a week earlier guess what not a meth lab nothing to do with meth they stole the gas they
[3581.04 → 3587.38] stole gas not a meth lab because gas is like expensive and worth a lot we are actually living
[3587.38 → 3593.60] in the most expensive city for gasoline or petrol the lower mainland has all 10 of the most expensive
[3593.60 → 3599.54] cities to buy gas in North America yeah, thanks for tax, but it's just yeah it just goes to say that
[3599.54 → 3605.66] news these days my goodness ridiculous and like we screwed up but I don't think we screwed up as bad as
[3605.66 → 3609.46] that I don't know either way um I just thought that was actually pretty hilarious I had something
[3609.46 → 3615.56] oh yeah the sun is apparently just a joke in general like I read the comments on this article
[3615.56 → 3619.84] and it was just ridiculous and I talked to some people from where it's actually published and they
[3619.84 → 3624.70] said yeah that magazine's just ridiculous but how do these things exist like you go to the grocery
[3624.70 → 3629.48] store, and you always see them on the rack as you're leaving, and it's like two aliens found in the desert
[3629.48 → 3634.04] dissected, and we're going to die in two days, and it's like how is that newspaper even if you look I'm gonna
[3634.04 → 3638.80] switch back even if you look at this article that you can see picture it's talking something about its
[3638.80 → 3645.60] vehicle right uses lasers Google Maps satellites complex algorithms and a tremendous amount of data 750
[3645.60 → 3653.64] megabytes per second to navigate the road ahead well and the next one is Star Trek recorder so
[3653.64 → 3660.46] yeah yeah it's so this whole article is uh this is but how do these how are they still around
[3660.46 → 3667.20] I don't there's so many things so many things like the tabloid magazines that you see in the
[3667.20 → 3673.60] marketplace that everyone knows are just completely bullshit how is that still a thing Cyrus makes music
[3673.60 → 3679.42] we'll never know we'll never know how things work out I don't even mind her song that much the music
[3679.42 → 3686.24] video is just ridiculous you know what the song you know the song's not even bad segue until she the
[3686.24 → 3691.10] chorus I don't like the wrecking ball part but the leading she's actually a talented singer and
[3691.10 → 3695.68] there's an amazing clip that you can find um I won't go bring it up you can go search for yourself
[3695.68 → 3701.74] but Miley Cyrus is a good-looking lady besides when she cuts her hair and sticks her tongue out and does all
[3701.74 → 3707.86] these crazy things and there's a clip going she says I love when I watch videos of uh a celebrity
[3707.86 → 3712.02] she's saying this, and you go what you know what you used to be so beautiful what did you do to
[3712.02 → 3717.64] yourself, and you're just like oh damn you know the rage comics where the face goes like way out of it
[3717.64 → 3725.36] that's what I want to do that's fine all right so now next topic which again we do like we do a
[3725.36 → 3730.56] topic let me talk about AMD let me do a topic let me talk about AMD um so we're going to talk about
[3730.56 → 3737.66] AMD again um AMD swings a profit in quarter three of 48 million dollars now this might if you're
[3737.66 → 3744.86] looking at like the scale of how big this company is that might not seem that ridiculous but they
[3744.86 → 3751.10] haven't been swinging profits for kind of long time so it's really nice to see them back in the
[3751.10 → 3756.38] game we've seen a lot of news this week about them being back in the game so it's kind of awesome to
[3756.38 → 3760.44] see them pulling a profit because the more they actually pull a profit instead of you losing all
[3760.44 → 3764.96] the millions ever like they've been doing for a long time they can actually start getting more
[3764.96 → 3770.10] money into that and they can start getting more money into the CPU side the GPU side everything
[3770.10 → 3775.64] I'm interested to see what Timmy thinks about this yeah, yeah well the first thing I think as an AMD
[3775.64 → 3781.04] stockholder is that the good god they lost 56 cents a share today that yeah
[3781.04 → 3790.88] yeah so that's got you know almost 14 percent down um it's this is the one of those things where
[3790.88 → 3798.82] like everybody's like oh my god the world is ending pcs are dying right nobody's buying pcs anymore but
[3798.82 → 3805.60] 10 years ago how many people did you know that had a five-year-old pc like almost nobody now how many
[3805.60 → 3810.80] people you know how many do you know that have a five-year-old pc like everybody I know that's not
[3810.80 → 3816.56] me almost right I mean because if you're not doing like you know rendering or hardcore gaming there's
[3816.56 → 3821.38] you know your XP system is probably still just fine for your email and playing POGO on the internet
[3821.38 → 3828.30] right I mean so I think the problem with analysts in this situation is that they're looking at like
[3828.30 → 3836.60] you know where's the pc market in you know 10 years well if video games are easier to port to the pc
[3836.60 → 3844.36] and make look better and the steam pc come or the steam uh OS comes out, and you get all this stuff
[3844.36 → 3850.96] where you know you can see the trend right now is people are shifting back from consoles to the pc
[3850.96 → 3857.00] yeah yeah and I think you know the fact that this is I think somebody I was reading one of the articles
[3857.00 → 3862.62] on this where they were saying uh it was like two quarters earlier than they thought that they were
[3862.62 → 3868.32] going to make a profit again yeah right so they were projecting like q1 of next year
[3868.32 → 3876.72] the to make a profit basically when all the consoles start selling right yeah so I think some of this
[3876.72 → 3881.78] 48 million is because of the consoles that have already been made yeah definitely right i think
[3881.78 → 3890.18] that's some of it but long term I think especially from you know the value that you get from their product i
[3890.18 → 3895.22] I don't think they're going away and I think they're just going to keep kind of shifting to be
[3895.22 → 3900.76] more profitable i I think they're headed back in the right direction and one thing that I want to
[3900.76 → 3905.26] segue out of what you just said actually is the whole thing with pc gaming not necessarily going
[3905.26 → 3910.18] away it's just people aren't upgrading as fast is the graphic that is on screen right now that was
[3910.18 → 3913.88] actually put up by NVIDIA I know we're talking about AMD right now but who cares we're fans of both
[3913.88 → 3919.70] um and this is interesting now I don't know if all these specs are pc gaming by itself because they
[3919.70 → 3924.24] bring up stuff like uh Call of Duty or if that's all of it I don't remember the numbers for call
[3924.24 → 3929.24] of duty but I'm I think that might be all of Call of Duty not just the pc side uh, but they're showing
[3929.24 → 3939.24] like the 2013 Stanley Cup final got 8.2 million viewers the 2012 lol championship got 8.3 million
[3939.24 → 3946.82] viewers is that supposed to be the 2013 lol championship um it's NVIDIA graphics so what it says on the
[3946.82 → 3951.54] NVIDIA graphics is the 2012 lol championship 2013 was pretty recent yeah so they might not have the
[3951.54 → 3956.08] numbers on that I'm not well actually no they probably do maybe I'm not sure when either
[3956.08 → 3963.26] way um like a pc gaming tournament beat out the 2013 Stanley Cup final and league has only grown
[3963.26 → 3968.82] so you would imagine that probably only going to is higher yeah, yeah so that's monstrous and the NFL
[3968.82 → 3975.02] more than nfl is huge and an amazing industry in the states if you don't know much about
[3975.02 → 3979.82] the NFL you don't even have to know about sports they actually run on a socialist ideal um they
[3979.82 → 3984.40] share money amongst teams that's why they're so incredibly successful as opposed to MLB which
[3984.40 → 3989.12] always has the same teams winning essentially you know what I mean it's always New York just has too
[3989.12 → 3997.96] much money and um but NFL revenue nine and a half billion dollars virtual goods 15 15 billion dollars
[3997.96 → 4006.56] billion dollars just ridiculous hours played quarter one 2013 13.5 billion for just the top 20 games
[4006.56 → 4014.62] Netflix was four billion yeah like holy crap I had that was the one that I was going to say out of all of
[4014.62 → 4020.52] these that was the number that made me go like whoa the 13.5 billion hours yeah yeah that was
[4020.52 → 4026.20] because everybody I know watches Netflix yeah me too and like we'll idle it quite often and just have
[4026.20 → 4030.98] it in the background or whatever so like that's insane so all the people that think pc gaming is
[4030.98 → 4036.66] dying check out this little graphic I have never people jump on the dying boat so quickly yeah I've
[4036.66 → 4044.50] never been on it, I have never thought pc game was dying truly because we get a lot of the games that
[4044.50 → 4048.92] the console gamers get you know they make them for all titles, and we get so many games that are to our
[4048.92 → 4053.74] own like we're going to jump back to it for a second but I'm just doing it for the numbers world of
[4053.74 → 4058.84] warcraft's not mentioned on here what is the revenue for that game over the past decade
[4058.84 → 4064.14] monstrous oh my goodness I don't even want to throw a number because it'd be too small someone in the
[4064.14 → 4071.40] chat just said 13.5 billion hours filthy casuals yes I do agree you're navigating away, and you're on
[4071.40 → 4078.78] sorry, sorry okay um but yeah so the one okay so pc gaming in my mind didn't it hasn't necessarily
[4078.78 → 4085.54] died, but it did kind of dwindle for a bit Xbox 360 and PS3 rained pretty hard there for a while
[4085.54 → 4091.98] it's true, but we're getting out of that swing and pc gaming is back baby unlike that guy because he
[4091.98 → 4097.36] didn't really come back properly but I think pc gaming came back properly well and I think you know if
[4097.36 → 4103.70] you eventually see you know they have developer connects for pc right, but you can't really play
[4103.70 → 4108.10] games with those I think if you saw something like to connect come out for the pc as well
[4108.10 → 4116.20] or the steam box or whatever that you would see those casual gamers starting to say why do I need a
[4116.20 → 4122.08] console when my pc can actually do everything I want it to do yeah that's a perfect point and I think
[4122.08 → 4128.02] there's going to be I think new things are going to drive a lot of hype for pc gaming as well like
[4128.02 → 4134.62] uh we've seen stuff like Oculus Rift I know that's definitely not as mass consumer friendly as say a
[4134.62 → 4141.12] connect um by mass consumer friendly I mean the random people aren't going to go to a store and be
[4141.12 → 4145.64] like oh what should I buy for my kid I'm going to buy him an Oculus Rift I don't think that's going to
[4145.64 → 4150.04] happen quite yet because it's a little bit more hardcore a connect you can put up in your room, and it's a
[4150.04 → 4153.70] family room or whatever, and it's a very casual situation so it's going to be open to more people
[4153.70 → 4158.96] that way but if you're a gamer a pretty hardcore gamer, and you've been on console for a while but
[4158.96 → 4163.80] you liked pc in the past, and you want to try something new you're probably going to go for pc
[4163.80 → 4172.88] and an Oculus Rift so I do think like not necessarily um just games big MMOs and stuff that can only
[4172.88 → 4177.68] be released on a pc are going to be what's going to drive stuff onto pc obviously mobs right now
[4177.68 → 4182.84] is happening huge it's helping everyone's making one at pax yeah you know there they must have been
[4182.84 → 4191.32] what three mobs right really smite blizzard's new thing uh what's uh the one with heroes of new earth
[4191.32 → 4197.74] there was one right the superhero ones yeah the superhero one that had axe laugh and axle toss
[4197.74 → 4203.14] casting I can't even remember what it was called which is so it was like DC heroes or something
[4203.14 → 4207.92] yeah I was just there to meet them and get their signature I wasn't really sure what the mob was
[4207.92 → 4212.58] about but I definitely wanted to meet uh both those guys apparently me cracking my neck hurt people's
[4212.58 → 4218.42] ears oh really sure as you I've done I've done a couple good pops oops probably both have I just
[4218.42 → 4222.92] went yeah I just went for a go maybe it might have been you actually now what we were talking about
[4222.92 → 4230.38] with the Oculus Rift and um oh shoot help me for one second Oculus Rift pc the Xbox connect
[4230.38 → 4234.54] thank you I don't know why that happened um but something I've said since the beginning of the
[4234.54 → 4238.58] connect and the Oculus Rift I'm going to make myself unpopular for a second hopefully just for a second
[4238.58 → 4245.68] but I am not hugely into that technology yet but I'm extraordinarily excited to see where it's going
[4245.68 → 4250.02] to go version two or whatever yeah I got an Oculus Rift coming I have a dev kit it should be coming this
[4250.02 → 4254.70] month they're they're cool don't get me wrong but I'm not like oh my god all I want to do today is go
[4254.70 → 4259.84] play my oculus I'm not really there yet and to connect isn't really I am I a lot of people are
[4259.84 → 4262.68] Oculus Rift that's what I'm that's what I'm saying I'm going to make myself a little bit
[4262.68 → 4265.78] unpopular there might be some people with agree with me and if you're on the boat right now that's
[4265.78 → 4271.56] awesome I support you but I'm just I'm not necessarily totally jumping into the pool yet
[4271.56 → 4276.92] I'm but I'm really excited to see where it's going to go because it is only going to develop
[4276.92 → 4282.72] exponentially yeah and I'm totally with you guys no go for it did you guys check out uh well
[4282.72 → 4289.60] wins did that video on the omni right yep that thing is cool that's really cool you know the fact
[4289.60 → 4296.56] that you have like positioning and the Oculus Rift, and you can run and jump and turn
[4296.56 → 4303.12] um you know with an actual you know gun that's basically your controller that's using
[4303.12 → 4310.54] um tracking to know where you're pointing uh my only comment was does it come in 3xl but
[4310.54 → 4317.88] I'm with you buddy yeah no i actually when we went to go test it I don't know if you saw this footage
[4317.88 → 4326.02] but I tried it out too and uh it at that point in time was not in 3xl if we can say it was not
[4326.02 → 4332.50] tall enough actually my waist was too high, and my feet were too big so I had to go with I think i
[4332.50 → 4338.02] was in my socks or no they found shoes that fit me if I wore them as if I was a rock climber so my
[4338.02 → 4341.96] toes were like that in the end which was terrible, and then it was too high so I couldn't wear the belt
[4341.96 → 4346.12] so I was trying to go around in the omni while just like holding on to it my hand to support my
[4346.12 → 4349.60] that's that's a different topic i kind of I don't want to include that in what I was saying
[4349.60 → 4353.90] with because that is really if I could play that every day I probably would that's not something
[4353.90 → 4358.52] everyone can put in their living room exactly yeah it's too it's one of the problems with that is
[4358.52 → 4365.16] it's too big so it has that it has the adaptation problem that Oculus Rift does but in
[4365.16 → 4371.18] a different way Oculus Rift is quite hardcore um omni is still really hardcore but at least your
[4371.18 → 4377.30] open area which automatically makes things a little bit easier to adopt um, but it's big
[4377.30 → 4381.80] and it's not really collapsible so you need kind of a dedicated area for it to go which is interesting
[4381.80 → 4387.32] someone wants to know what size your shoes are what are they 13 13 13 13 yeah um they're not like
[4387.32 → 4394.34] monstrous but when in like the kit that they brought to our meeting they didn't have any in
[4394.34 → 4400.72] there yet i I'm like 99.9 sure you can get shoes big enough for me, I'm bigger now um but they only
[4400.72 → 4409.30] had like three different kinds of shoes there 13 is the sandals for lions do they have sandals for
[4409.30 → 4415.38] Linus uh I don't think they did actually I can't remember what they had built in socks with sandals
[4415.38 → 4422.12] built it wow that's fantastic um specially developed Sebastian sandals that's what they're
[4422.12 → 4426.94] called he had converse they had converse shoes for Linus and converse was like wow this isn't even
[4426.94 → 4431.40] a company anymore where do you find these and I was like wow I'm not up on fashion, but you have no
[4431.40 → 4436.84] idea what you're talking about yeah converse is definitely yeah definitely a thing I was like I don't
[4436.84 → 4446.58] often go out you actually just don't go out at all like jeez man oh jeez okay so give me one sec
[4446.58 → 4449.94] and I think we can jump into the other topic unless one of you guys have more to say
[4449.94 → 4458.88] I'm pretty good all right so what do we have now um nexus 5 leaked on the play store there isn't a ton
[4458.88 → 4466.08] of information about this, but it's back soon for the wan show just the title I could change that
[4466.08 → 4471.34] not a huge deal it's probably too late now um nexus 5 leaked on the wan show we're going to jump to
[4471.34 → 4478.84] Richard's screen right now um I'm cold at the thank-you cold at the screen right now my bad um
[4478.84 → 4486.46] interesting, but it looks really cool there's not really a lot of information we've already seen
[4486.46 → 4492.62] like the only thing that I really got from this was the fact that it was 349 dollars I think that's
[4492.62 → 4497.58] kind of the main piece of information to get yeah you know because there 's's been better photos
[4497.58 → 4501.26] leaked already yeah I've seen better photos of this leaked already there were photos leaked with
[4501.26 → 4507.84] tells logo on it which was just I was like what really oh okay weird because they're like only
[4507.84 → 4512.74] here yeah I'm like oh um but yeah there's there are photos leaked with tells logo all over it which was
[4512.74 → 4520.78] kind of funny um Linus is tweeting things to me why doesn't he text me or something what a silly man
[4520.78 → 4526.24] give me one second oh I can't find it because there are so many tweets from other people
[4526.24 → 4532.76] uh but yeah it looks really cool the thing is they're going to have a lot of competition there's
[4532.76 → 4538.58] so many cool phones coming out and I know you guys um should be releasing a note 3 video
[4538.58 → 4542.64] pretty quickly which is going to be a very interesting phone, so the competition in phones
[4542.64 → 4547.60] right now is incredible um things like cyanogen mod coming out and trying to develop into something
[4547.60 → 4554.06] that's one click I'm going to pause you for one quick second everyone tweet um at slick pc and uh
[4554.06 → 4561.40] one second and at Timmy tech TV and at cold SC all in one big thing with questions for Timmy tech TV
[4561.40 → 4568.86] I forgot to do a twitter blitz we'll be doing a Twitter blitz soon um so tweet them questions and keep
[4568.86 → 4574.60] going you're talking about cyanogen mod I'm just saying it's a fascinating error for phones right
[4574.60 → 4579.94] now it's tech right now is awesome because I felt like it was a little dry there maybe for a bit
[4579.94 → 4583.82] but with the video cards are coming out AMD's stepping up and video's having to step up their
[4583.82 → 4588.88] game the new consoles are going to come out which is going to exponentially make pc games better which
[4588.88 → 4595.44] is why I'm excited about the consoles to come out uh you've got the steam box coming out um all the all
[4595.44 → 4600.12] the different phones like the note 3 is coming out looks amazing this new nexus phone is coming out
[4600.12 → 4606.70] you know it's its a perfect time uh to be around and in technology yeah for sure and like
[4606.70 → 4613.24] uh, uh 4.4 is going to be coming with this phone as well see that's awesome 4.4 is awesome I'm
[4613.24 → 4619.10] actually more excited for cyanogen mod to become something that is easier to implement yeah but
[4619.10 → 4625.20] then cyanogen model will get 4.4 too oh no yes, yes sorry yeah I didn't mean to yeah discredit that
[4625.20 → 4630.20] part of it but yeah yeah exactly um one interesting thing that they stated was capture the everyday
[4630.20 → 4635.54] and the epic in fresh new ways now I might have missed some leaks or something but I'm not entirely
[4635.54 → 4642.94] sure what they mean by that now the people saying um Linus tweeted me something about a 290x I checked
[4642.94 → 4650.78] his twitter I don't see anything from him, I'm not entirely sure what you guys are talking about
[4650.78 → 4658.90] I would expect more NVIDIA styled tweets well do we want to do uh Twitter blitz we can jump into the
[4658.90 → 4665.76] twitter blitz now that makes a lot of sense let's refresh sounds good all right, so these questions are
[4665.76 → 4672.78] directed at Timmy if I can oh no that's the wrong one whoop there we go
[4672.78 → 4681.90] no idea oh Geez don't play it
[4681.90 → 4686.40] apparently we've got comments so far
[4686.40 → 4694.62] best phone for under 450 unlocked others than the nexus 5
[4694.62 → 4699.84] what's I doingn't know the buyout prices I'm not very good at that
[4699.84 → 4707.06] I don't know the buyout prices either actually yeah I think the mega might be around that
[4707.06 → 4711.76] price with the buyout because it's pretty cheap so if you're looking for a big phone
[4711.76 → 4718.36] yeah that I actually held one the other day um it's insane personally I think the note 2 is
[4718.36 → 4723.56] a little too big the note 3 is a little bit smaller which is awesome the mega
[4723.56 → 4731.52] this is monstrous what like it makes the note 2 look like my s3 like when you compare the note 2
[4731.52 → 4738.54] and s3 side by side that's the same maybe uh fraction of difference I'm I'm failing on my
[4738.54 → 4745.60] vocabulary right now but the yeah exactly the scales um between the mega and the and my s and uh the
[4745.60 → 4750.28] note 2 it's kind of the same difference there it's the mega is ridiculous giant I've never actually
[4750.28 → 4756.08] seen one in real life it's ridiculous it's basically a tablet oh it's with the sim card that you can call
[4756.08 → 4762.08] yeah I was going to say I have an I have an um a galaxy uh three
[4762.08 → 4769.56] seven inch you know the tab just a tablet without the sim, and it's the same size as that
[4769.56 → 4775.98] I mean it's not seven inches exactly, but it's like the same size so it's ridiculous
[4775.98 → 4785.30] this article is saying 6.3 yeah it seems huge yeah it and honestly the screen isn't because it's so
[4785.30 → 4790.50] huge um I only used it for a second in the store it's not as if I reviewed it I wasn't overly impressed
[4790.50 → 4797.24] with the screen no, no yeah no I didn't have the tablets the 199 tablets look better to me yeah wow
[4797.24 → 4802.30] Geez that's interesting I'm going to go on something a little left field here I could be completely wrong
[4802.30 → 4810.06] so please Timmy correct me or or or yourself slick um was not the mega released in Asia first and then
[4810.06 → 4815.88] brought over here significantly later and not upgraded yeah see I thought it was I thought it
[4815.88 → 4823.38] was released in South Korea and uh Japan makes sense yeah I think when I was in Korea a lot of people
[4823.38 → 4829.52] have large form factor phones right were really popular right it yeah I could be completely wrong about
[4829.52 → 4833.62] that maybe we'll get a tweet or something but i yeah no i think you're right yeah it was
[4833.62 → 4838.80] released overseas first uh Japan Korea and not upgraded and then brought here significantly later
[4838.80 → 4844.26] and in phone time you know phone time is so much worse than dog years you know phone years you know
[4844.26 → 4848.98] one year in a phone year is it might as well be 30 yeah human years you know for crying out loud yeah
[4848.98 → 4858.18] uh so I got one here uh sure they were asking about uh any higher than 1080p monitors with DisplayPort for
[4858.18 → 4864.12] under 400 bucks um if you're going to go under 400 depends on the size obviously you're only probably
[4864.12 → 4871.90] going to see that in something like a 27 or a 30 inch what where I buy my monitors from is mono price
[4871.90 → 4878.92] because you can get basically they take like LG and Samsung panels that don't pass all the quality
[4878.92 → 4885.24] tests rebrand them as mono price monitors remove whatever features failed the quality test and then sell
[4885.24 → 4893.10] them for like half the price interesting so I bought it like my 27-inch mono price monitor was
[4893.10 → 4903.40] like 349, and it's an uh 1440p IPS it's like its mono price is a really, really interesting that's really
[4903.40 → 4910.62] cool and they so I buy all my cables and everything through mono price they you know so they will
[4910.62 → 4915.30] say that these are you know second party basically panels right I mean they're getting them they're
[4915.30 → 4919.90] failing quality tests, and they're they're taking features away from them, they don't shy away from
[4919.90 → 4926.24] that they're like hey you know if you can do without like these two features then you know save half
[4926.24 → 4931.04] price basically right, and they're brand new you know they have full mono price warranties and
[4931.04 → 4937.12] they're brand new it's not like they were returned, or you know there's their second hand it's just that
[4937.12 → 4941.78] you know they're not good enough for whatever model Samsung or whatever model most of them are LG
[4941.78 → 4953.34] um monitors i I love mine no dead pixels no uh backlight bleed it you know for what I paid for it, I can
[4953.34 → 4959.94] complain at all yeah uh we've got a new question on screen so how do you feel about NVIDIA's reveal of
[4959.94 → 4961.96] the GTX 780 ti
[4961.96 → 4976.02] um yeah you know personally I don't like the ti monikers myself uh it seems like they originally
[4976.02 → 4981.98] yeah titanium it seems like they originally created the ti moniker so that they could, you know like i
[4981.98 → 4988.78] said earlier so that they could rebrand something that they were holding off on in reaction to something
[4988.78 → 4995.74] that AMD does right because you don't really see a lot of AMD doing that you know you might now
[4995.74 → 5001.44] though because you notice they have the x and the non-x moniker yeah, yeah so we might start seeing that
[5001.44 → 5009.22] from AMD as well, but it just makes it hard you know as a consumer like oh well what's different why is it
[5009.22 → 5018.60] different how much better is the performance you know price per dollar um if it makes 780 go down in
[5018.60 → 5027.24] price, and it's roughly a titanium with less ram for 700 I'll be doing backflips to you know new egg or
[5027.24 → 5033.62] Amazon to buy one oh titan if it's roughly a titan with less ram so you mean right yeah okay sorry
[5033.62 → 5039.40] a titan that's cool um yeah it's its it's interesting and i kind of agree with the ti moniker thing
[5039.40 → 5044.74] um and with a slightly different angle I've always kind of understood the benchmarks because I've
[5044.74 → 5049.36] been running them for a long time um but from someone from the outside of I've seen people
[5049.36 → 5056.14] comment like okay well is this 660 ti better than a 670 like without looking at the benchmarks they're
[5056.14 → 5060.34] like what is this ti thing what does it actually mean in what way is it actually better they're not
[5060.34 → 5065.06] looking into the deep specs of it they're not going out and actually figuring out what's different
[5065.06 → 5068.30] they're going like what am I supposed to buy why is there all these different revisions of different
[5068.30 → 5072.52] things now to me, it's a little bit more simple than that I don't think it's actually that
[5072.52 → 5078.22] complicated in the naming convention, but it's its it's very likely to do with what you're talking
[5078.22 → 5086.60] about which is where it's its very likely just oh we made this thing, but we don't we kind of need
[5086.60 → 5090.44] to push it out now so let's just kind of change the name and push it out, and then we'll deal with
[5090.44 → 5098.68] other stuff later let's move on uh where is the screen right now up a little bit there we go
[5098.68 → 5107.94] guys asking is it worth it for him to get rid of his 1280 by 1024 monitors and get a 1440 p1 or keep
[5107.94 → 5111.10] my monitors and SLI my 660 what do you think kind of
[5111.10 → 5114.60] uh
[5114.60 → 5121.48] um I don't I don't think you want to SLI a 660 right now um
[5121.48 → 5130.46] you know I would say depending on what you do with it for me, you know 1440 p so I don't I don't
[5130.46 → 5137.78] actually game at 1440 p because my main machine has a GTX 670 um and I don't like you know like
[5137.78 → 5147.12] bios hock infinite at 1440 p on my card is like 23 frames a second um and that's not a situation I like to
[5147.12 → 5151.08] game and I don't like watching, and you know you see the tear and stuff just like you know it's
[5151.08 → 5158.62] terrible especially the tear um so I tend to game I tend to flip my panel between the 1440 and
[5158.62 → 5164.38] the 1080 depending on what I'm doing what I really use the 1440 for is like especially when
[5164.38 → 5170.92] I'm editing videos the more real estate you can get for like you know work related things uh the better
[5170.92 → 5177.14] off you are so that's what you know i I would say 1440 if you're going to go over
[5177.14 → 5184.80] you're going to go over 27 inches it's I think 1440 is important, but you have to have the video card to
[5184.80 → 5190.94] drive it yeah yeah um and one thing to keep in mind too is with his current setup maybe not SLI
[5190.94 → 5195.56] in the 660 but maybe if you like vendor the 660 like sell it one bay or something like that
[5195.56 → 5200.44] and then upgrade your card directly like get an actual GPU replacement maybe go up 700 series
[5200.44 → 5207.78] or something like that um not a terrible idea it's going down no i actually you know I've
[5207.78 → 5213.84] seen Linus recommend that before in the past to don't SLI a generation old card if you're going to have
[5213.84 → 5218.48] to buy a new one to do it or even a used one right I mean look at how much you could make from selling
[5218.48 → 5224.70] your card and that you would be paying for the new card take that performance benchmarks that are all
[5224.70 → 5229.64] over the place right and look at the new performance benchmarks and like I bet you could probably buy
[5229.64 → 5236.42] as you know a 760 or 770 for the same price yeah yeah definitely not a bad idea now this guy's tweet
[5236.42 → 5241.22] not directly going after Timmy but I just wanted to bring this up Vivaldi owned blizzard before wow
[5241.22 → 5245.72] the problem is Activision not Vivaldi you guys are mixing stuff up yep notice that in the article it's
[5245.72 → 5250.32] just i how it was worded I read it wrong it was just a little bit confusing sorry about that we figured
[5250.32 → 5257.10] that out moving on now you've kind of i will say though I will say in some aspect though
[5257.10 → 5265.62] blizzard still made good games after the Activision merger so they may not have been as good as they
[5265.62 → 5272.58] were when blizzard was just off by itself but Vivaldi as a multinational huge distributor
[5272.58 → 5282.76] you can see the companies that have gone under them fail horribly so I think I'm just happier i
[5282.76 → 5287.26] would rather Activision went back to being Activision by itself to be honest with you, but that would be
[5287.26 → 5292.42] awesome I felt like I felt like they I felt like produced better games before they took over blizzard
[5292.42 → 5297.44] I feel like everything was just better when they were just apart um now we've got a tweet that's not
[5297.44 → 5305.06] on screen, but it says um with overclocking could a regular 780 surpass a 780 ti it might be at the
[5305.06 → 5313.54] top oh ah who knows yeah I was actually i was letting you take that one because I'm trying to
[5313.54 → 5319.30] have this twitter blitz focused on you, but we know absolutely nothing about this card uh we know it
[5319.30 → 5325.82] is a thing we've seen it's a thing so I guess here's what I would say if you're doing 1080p gaming or
[5325.82 → 5334.42] 1440p gaming um could a 780 beat a titan they get pretty close in 1080p gaming because the
[5334.42 → 5339.28] what you're getting with what you're getting with the titan is that extra ram right yeah more than
[5339.28 → 5342.64] anything I mean you get a few more coup de cores and a little bit more of an overclock but
[5342.64 → 5351.00] and an awesome name you know yeah and an awesome name exactly sorry I was going to say my joke a while
[5351.00 → 5356.86] ago was uh, uh if is the 290x is really the quote unquote titan killer they should call it like Zeus
[5356.86 → 5361.38] or something because the Olympians killed the titans right yeah that's perfect that would be
[5361.38 → 5366.32] awesome I loved Greek mythology oh they should have done that that would be cool called the Zeus card
[5366.32 → 5371.86] they should have done that that would have been awesome that was okay they missed a huge possible
[5371.86 → 5376.72] marketing ploy with the not doing 9000 titan killers because everything would have been over
[5376.72 → 5381.86] 9000 so they missed a huge over 9000 marketing things, and then they missed the titan killers thing
[5381.86 → 5388.38] with Zeus man titans were supposed to be more powerful jeez yeah yeah excuse me sorry guys and
[5388.38 → 5392.52] then and then that would have just played in oh man good yeah Timmy that would have played in so well
[5392.52 → 5398.20] uh someone's saying Timmy was a good guest if I can scroll up here a little bit it is sorry
[5398.20 → 5405.10] Timmy is a good guest subscribed so that's cool uh he went to pax so that automatically
[5405.10 → 5410.76] he went to pax, and he enabled a large part of the team to go to pax as well which is really helpful
[5410.76 → 5418.84] yeah somehow they escaped basement though when I wasn't paying attention so
[5418.84 → 5427.34] um there are two questions here one how do you think AMD's true audio will compare to sound cards and
[5427.34 → 5434.58] onboard sound uh I think an important thing to remember is true audio is only going to be on I think
[5434.58 → 5442.36] it was the 260x and the 290x is that right I don't remember the exact cards, but it's only it's yeah
[5442.36 → 5453.02] it's only on two cards it's not on all of them so um going to be better than on board audio for in my
[5453.02 → 5461.46] opinion for sure um the question is you know will there'll be like mantle is components you know API
[5461.46 → 5468.00] level stuff that game developers can hook into um and how well will that be adopted you know it's
[5468.00 → 5475.94] just like uh the NVIDIA g-sync stuff right it's its how well adopted is it going to be are developers
[5475.94 → 5481.68] going to develop for it or is it just going to be this thing where like AMD pays you know dice or
[5481.68 → 5490.54] somebody to implement this technology like NVIDIA does for physics right yeah but I think
[5490.54 → 5498.80] it's sorry keep going I was going to say you know versus discrete cards uh hard to tell because those
[5498.80 → 5506.68] discrete cards are very focused at you know just doing audio codecs really well yeah um one thing too
[5506.68 → 5511.88] is that it's not a deck um so right you're going to have some interesting things there, but then it has
[5511.88 → 5515.80] interesting stuff that sound cards can't really do which is where it plays into like more the physics
[5515.80 → 5521.64] of what's going on in the game it can be more dynamic so it's I don't necessarily think it will
[5521.64 → 5527.00] uh see a huge part of the problem again we're talking about stuff that's not like we haven't
[5527.00 → 5533.40] touched it yet um we've done that a few times this stream um but uh I don't necessarily think that it
[5533.40 → 5537.66] will sound better like I don't think the quality of the sound will necessarily be increased but I'm
[5537.66 → 5545.66] expecting what you hear to be more accurate not I was going to say spatial awareness should be much
[5545.66 → 5551.66] better yeah but then the quality of the sound of the spatial awareness not necessarily
[5551.66 → 5562.06] going to be much better um moving on in the twitter topics no poke today sir uh it's true you avoided it
[5562.06 → 5567.02] we have no idea when the 800 series is going to come out the world your dodge dice uh I'm gonna
[5567.02 → 5571.74] screw up a little bit why is there so little DisplayPort monitors on the market
[5574.86 → 5586.06] oh displayport um I think what really killed DisplayPort was the fact that when HDMI 1.4 came out
[5586.06 → 5598.46] and supposedly HDMI 2 is coming yeah soon is right um I think the bandwidth on HDMI is getting
[5598.46 → 5607.02] enough to where it's hard to justify for like a TV to go to DisplayPort because it's not a standard you
[5607.02 → 5612.94] know there's not really like does your vivo need a DisplayPort out on it no right uh does your DVD
[5612.94 → 5618.94] player need a DisplayPort out and most of the panel manufacturers now are also TV manufacturers
[5619.82 → 5625.82] yeah so you tend to see most monitors anymore have a HDMI connection and a DVI connection right
[5627.26 → 5636.14] yeah so I think it's just a cost thing um it's I know why well I was going to say the reason that video
[5636.14 → 5642.62] cards come with DVI connections is they're smaller than um our DVI uh DisplayPort connections is
[5642.62 → 5648.62] they're smaller than DVI so if you want to fit four uh connections on the back of a video card
[5648.62 → 5653.58] you're never going to do it with four DVI connections so they had to go to a standard
[5653.58 → 5657.26] right they had to go to a standard that's smaller but that you could put an adapter on
[5658.14 → 5664.70] that can go from you know DisplayPort to DVI and not have to worry about you know not being able to do
[5664.70 → 5671.50] like 1440. yeah, and like you brought up a lot of the manufacturers for monitors are also making TVs so
[5671.50 → 5679.74] that's a perfect huge point um but to kind of play devil's advocate DisplayPort's not super
[5679.74 → 5685.82] strong right now um I use it, but it's not very common um I like it a lot actually I love the
[5685.82 → 5693.74] connector the connector is so solid, but you're starting to see it um a little bit more like the 279q
[5693.74 → 5702.70] pa279q from um Asus beast monitor that we have downstairs we should be running that on DisplayPort
[5702.70 → 5709.42] um and then the new NVIDIA thing what is it sync it's called sync right yeah gsync sorry that
[5709.42 → 5715.74] I believe has to be run over DisplayPort yep yeah so I thought that's what they said yeah I'm pretty
[5715.74 → 5720.70] sure that's what they said I don't fully remember, but it's very new news um but I'm pretty sure that's
[5720.70 → 5727.10] that's what they said so DisplayPort is a thing and will hopefully keep growing because I love it
[5727.10 → 5733.50] but it's its definitely not too big of a thing I will say uh anybody that uses has something with a
[5733.50 → 5740.06] mini HDMI port on it like every time I have to plug in an external monitor to my Asus Ultrabook
[5740.62 → 5747.82] I want to kill myself because it's a mini HDMI and not a mini DVI or DisplayPort excuse me um because
[5747.82 → 5752.78] the mini DisplayPort when you plug it in it locks right yeah, and you can't, you know it like stays
[5752.78 → 5758.14] solidly seated the HDMI you plug it in its just like I lose my connection if I like you know if you
[5758.14 → 5765.26] move it all my laptop you know an eighth of an inch you know, so the connector is the big thing for me i
[5765.26 → 5771.34] wish that you know I mean personally my personal feelings is I wish HDMI would just die um and we
[5771.34 → 5777.02] could all go to DisplayPort so that we got actual connectors that locked in its aggressive but I agree you know
[5777.02 → 5782.46] what sometimes you have to take a stance yeah just kill it off bring it out to the field give it to
[5782.46 → 5789.58] the farmer um office space or am I showing my age office space take the photocopier out
[5789.58 → 5799.90] play some good rap music yeah wear some crappy ties and yeah beat it up um opinions on the hdc1 max
[5799.90 → 5808.70] what do you think so i I will admit that I am very new to any android devices at all
[5810.22 → 5817.82] i actually I know my main phone is actually an apple 4s just because um I'm not out of contract
[5817.82 → 5824.46] yet and I can't buy it no, no the note 3 I was like I went I actually went into the store the other
[5824.46 → 5828.78] day I'm like oh when does my contract come up because I have to buy a note 3 note 3s they were
[5828.78 → 5835.74] like oh four months and I'm like no, no they'll usually let you out a month early for free just to get
[5835.74 → 5842.86] you back yeah so maybe three but so only the actual only android device I own is my tablet
[5842.86 → 5849.42] right okay we can move on from that I'm excited about the hdc1 max I think the hdc1 is a great phone
[5849.42 → 5854.86] I think I've always liked HD personally and I really think with the one series uh they're really
[5854.86 → 5859.66] hitting their stride and I'm excited for it there's my little answer I love phones that's that's that's
[5859.66 → 5864.86] one thing I'm definitely into but Timmy you were saying you want to wait for the note 3 man i I think
[5864.86 → 5872.30] the note 3 is going to be possibly the best phone the planet has seen and could be that for a while
[5872.30 → 5876.86] I literally has ever seen and obviously Kate because it's the newest phone right it gives
[5876.86 → 5881.34] a big advantage, but they've really they really improved on some things the note 2 was a solid
[5881.34 → 5885.90] phone but I really think they improved on quite a few things well obviously I have to see once it's
[5885.90 → 5890.94] circulated and use how it goes um but just because it's big you know the battery life is incredible
[5890.94 → 5896.94] the s pen features are great so pretty excited yeah no i I played with one and I love the thing so
[5896.94 → 5901.98] mm-hmm yeah uh moving on one quick thing that I'm going to cover really quickly, and then we'll jump right
[5901.98 → 5906.86] off is 215 bucks a good deal for a pair dynamic custom bear dynamic custom one pro I got these
[5906.86 → 5912.94] for cheaper I don't know, but mine were cheaper so I don't think it's that spectacular moving on to
[5912.94 → 5918.78] one that I forgot to put in the wan show doc but I had seen this mike underscore f thank you
[5918.78 → 5925.50] for reminding me halo 3 free to play on Xbox gold that has become a thing uh I think it was bungee
[5925.50 → 5930.78] tweeted about it really it's that's actually like that's pretty cool that's pretty cool you know
[5930.78 → 5934.70] Mr mike double score f tweets a lot actually it's got a lot of good stuff, but that's really that's
[5934.70 → 5941.02] that's fascinating halo 2 was the glory days for halo with me yeah me too, but that's awesome
[5941.02 → 5946.38] that's a really that's just random really cool yeah so if you have an Xbox, and you have
[5947.26 → 5951.98] Xbox gold you feel like playing some halo 3 you'll grab some halo 3 it's free so that's
[5951.98 → 5959.10] actually the other thing too I mean keep in mind that destiny is coming yep and halo 3 was the
[5959.10 → 5964.70] last halo game that bungee studios made actually yeah that makes so much I didn't think about the
[5964.70 → 5968.54] destiny's coming thing that makes so much more sense watch the trailer for that today it's like
[5968.54 → 5973.98] it's like hey we're still here don't forget about us, we made this game that you guys liked
[5973.98 → 5977.90] yeah a little bit of nostalgia go play it for a little bit so you remember us yeah you buy this
[5977.90 → 5984.86] new game bungee's a great studio I'm really excited um dangers will not be raised tonight I'm going to fly
[5984.86 → 5993.66] by that uh Timmy I'm looking at I'm I'm looking hard at the VGA hadron air any thoughts input or
[5993.66 → 6002.38] updates would be awesome I'm excited actually I actually have one um which I've completely dismantled we don't
[6002.38 → 6008.46] uh yeah I can send you mine, but it's uh I took all the rivets out of it and took it apart um
[6009.42 → 6015.90] so I'm actually sending it to get sandblasted and repainted I like it so much oh the only thing
[6015.90 → 6020.22] yeah the only thing I'm really I'm kind of like Linus with cases sometimes which is like
[6020.78 → 6027.18] it doesn't have to be the prettiest thing in the world, but it really has to like be consistent so there
[6027.18 → 6032.30] is some spots on it that like on the interior of the case is painted black, but some spots aren't
[6032.30 → 6039.98] because in the next version that's coming out of the hadron there's a water reservoir there oh so
[6041.18 → 6050.46] um because there is a hadron water one coming there are some photos out there on it um but the only
[6050.46 → 6057.74] the only thing that really scares me about it is the airflow there are no filters on the case anywhere
[6058.94 → 6064.22] um so it's just going to be a dust magnet which is why I actually took it all apart so that I can put
[6064.22 → 6073.74] some fine mesh in it um and I'm also going to add a little bit of uh like a fan to the front so
[6073.74 → 6079.66] it has two exhaust fans on the top uh which you could flip around and make intake fans if you wanted
[6079.66 → 6084.38] to uh which is actually what I would recommend because you could flip them around make them intake
[6084.38 → 6090.38] fans even though it's not optimal uh and then put uh get like you know a mesh filter put on top of
[6090.38 → 6095.74] them and then put the top back on it yeah and then at least you would have some kind of protection
[6095.74 → 6101.66] and you would uh at that point you would have you know a pressure in the case that would push out
[6101.66 → 6106.46] all of the know normally quote-unquote intake holes and so it wouldn't be as dusty
[6107.18 → 6114.70] um but I think to be honest with you even with its shortfalls uh it's one of my favourite it cases
[6114.70 → 6120.78] I've ever seen you should probably post that build log once he's done on the uh yeah yeah no it's up
[6120.78 → 6126.06] there nice it's like it's like hadron tear down or something I had a feeling I had maybe seen it
[6126.06 → 6131.58] before but I wasn't entirely sure but that's all, but it is like the perfect size
[6131.58 → 6138.46] for an it case well that's that's fascinating because um speaking of like steam
[6138.46 → 6142.62] machines and all that kind of stuff coming out now yeah um I've been talking to you a little
[6142.62 → 6146.38] bit about how I'm thinking about doing a build refresh what I want to do my build refresh for
[6146.38 → 6151.90] is Haswell e okay so I get ddr4 Haswell e and then I'm going to aim around because I'm aiming for that
[6151.90 → 6156.70] I'm probably going to be going in on maxwell but then I don't know maybe AMD will have some answer
[6156.70 → 6161.18] at that point in time or maxwell won't be that impressive than I'll get a 290x we'll, we'll see
[6161.18 → 6165.82] how it goes but I'm waiting for Haswell e so whatever graphics card is winning at that point
[6165.82 → 6172.14] in time I'll go with that um, but that means I'm probably retiring my 2600k yeah because I'm moving
[6172.14 → 6177.58] to 2011. Now what I want to do is take a 2600k go it and build a steam machine out of it because I'm
[6177.58 → 6182.46] so not done with that processor I love that processor so that would be cool the hadron case
[6182.46 → 6190.54] well because I wasn't sold on a case yet yeah just it's its the air the filtering is the
[6190.54 → 6197.74] the only real issue I have with it um it's actually it's pretty slick little case, and it mods really
[6197.74 → 6203.90] easy I mean you can like if you just wanted to say take out the drive cage, and you know Velcro in some
[6203.90 → 6209.02] SSDs or something you know there are a few rivets you have to drill out, but they're all aluminum
[6209.02 → 6214.06] yeah it goes fast and that's probably what I would do to be honest because um especially with
[6214.06 → 6218.94] the steam machine implementation I'll have all my big games stored on my main computer and I'll just
[6218.94 → 6224.06] stream them from my main computer so I won't need a lot of storage so I'll just have a smaller it
[6224.06 → 6228.54] doesn't even have to be that big especially with Linux smaller SSD and that's probably all I'll run
[6230.06 → 6236.22] yeah and this is I would say you know if people are familiar with the fractal 304 the node 304
[6236.22 → 6242.70] uh if it's is you lay the hadron on its side it's wider, but it's not as tall
[6244.30 → 6250.94] so it depends on you know where you're going to use it I guess because I really like the node the
[6250.94 → 6257.74] node 304 as well yeah, but it has the same problem it has no airflow right I mean that's some but not
[6257.74 → 6264.86] much yeah definitely um and just all this stuff with it getting big right now it's its awesome that
[6264.86 → 6268.38] they're getting into the market and I think it was smart for them to start with this case
[6269.18 → 6273.90] I think that was really smart because of all the I text stuff going on right now it's just brilliant
[6279.02 → 6281.58] give me one second I'm just going to find another tweet for us to go over
[6282.62 → 6289.50] um Timmy remind people where they can find you uh yeah what's your twitter handle oh yes so twitter
[6289.50 → 6298.46] is at detect TV and uh yes the YouTube is uh YouTube.com forward slash Timmy tech
[6300.86 → 6305.90] and so you just call it his twitter and his YouTube right so one thing I've noticed about
[6305.90 → 6309.82] Timmy's twitter is that he actually replies to everything I tried to do that as much as i
[6309.82 → 6313.90] possibly could when I first started my twitter, but it's a little bit insane right now so if you
[6313.90 → 6317.50] can i jump in on that yeah sorry no, no finish your point finish your point I apologize
[6319.82 → 6324.54] I can't now because of the last show I went on I almost doubled followers I went up to 500
[6324.54 → 6329.26] something which is awesome and I had a bunch of tweets saying like you did well and you know
[6329.26 → 6334.14] and I want to reply to all of them but I'm a little torn I see every single one of them i favourite most of
[6334.14 → 6338.70] them I'm torn because I don't want to reply to every single one and say thank you and then the next
[6338.70 → 6342.22] guy going to his twitter, and he has to go through coldest sea saying thank you 20 times
[6342.22 → 6346.62] right but I do try to reply it's an it's an interesting balance act and i kind of want to
[6346.62 → 6350.86] ask Timmy how he does balance it because I absolutely appreciate everyone who follows me
[6350.86 → 6357.02] and if you tweet at me, I see it 100 you know what I mean I don't I don't have the 16 000 that you do
[6357.02 → 6361.10] you know what I mean and I still look at all of them I just don't necessarily reply a favourite I look
[6361.10 → 6365.58] at every single tweet that's sent to me yeah it's just yeah I wasn't trying to say you just
[6365.58 → 6372.14] discard them um so I'm the same way I read them all for sure um I try to reply to a lot of them
[6372.14 → 6375.74] I was so excited today I was like going to be on the Sancho going to be the Sancho going to be the Sancho
[6375.74 → 6382.46] and somebody was finally like okay we get if it's like um, but you know this is where I was actually
[6382.46 → 6389.66] told somebody today I wish um that you instead you know there's like the private feature but I wish you
[6389.66 → 6395.90] could direct tweets at you know so you could say like don't show this in everybody's yeah but if they
[6395.90 → 6401.42] come look at me, you know if they come look at my you know personal page they would
[6401.42 → 6408.78] see it but don't broadcast it to their yeah personal page right their feed but let me reply to the
[6408.78 → 6413.82] person that just asked me that would be awesome sometimes I would freely respond so much more
[6413.82 → 6418.22] it's one of the reasons why I stopped replying to everyone because what I would do is I'd work all day
[6418.22 → 6423.74] and not check my twitter and then after work I'd sit down on my personal computer and reply to 200 people
[6423.74 → 6428.38] but then you're just going to spam everybody and I got tons of complaints so I was like I don't want
[6428.38 → 6433.10] to lose followers by saying thanks like in 30 tweets and guys like well I'm not following this dude
[6433.10 → 6438.86] any more yeah yeah as Timmy said as he described it twitter implemented that I honestly feel like
[6438.86 → 6442.94] because saying thank you takes two seconds to someone who's following you and sending you a tweet
[6442.94 → 6447.02] and if is you could just direct it at them like he said and not you know that would be awesome
[6447.02 → 6451.42] twitter needs to implement that I really think that would be and not just for us three
[6451.42 → 6456.62] no for everyone I feel like there'd be a lot more interaction if is you could manage it that
[6456.62 → 6462.06] way you know not broadcast um I just wonder if I wonder is they don't do that because of their
[6462.06 → 6468.22] whole trending idea hmm they're probably trying yeah but let it trend that's a good point
[6468.22 → 6475.34] let twitter see it yeah right just don't put it in people's feeds I don't care if twitter
[6475.34 → 6479.74] sees what I said it can even show up under the trend doesn't bother me yeah it could still trend
[6479.74 → 6485.98] up under right or even if somebody searched for like you know Timmy tech TV and all my replies
[6485.98 → 6491.34] came up that would be okay I just don't want to pollute people's feed exactly yeah because you go to
[6491.34 → 6495.42] the go to the home tab you check out your feed, and it's just all one dude because i I used to feel
[6495.42 → 6499.74] bad because I'd look at my home tab and then I'd respond to 200 people and then I'd look at my home
[6499.74 → 6504.30] tab again I'm like oh it's a whole bunch of yeahs, and you want at the same time you want to make them
[6504.30 → 6508.78] feel appreciated, and you don't want to spam the crap out of stuff because I don't like that I have I
[6508.78 → 6512.70] have followed people in the past that I've met in real life and unfollowed them a week later because
[6512.70 → 6518.62] when I go on Twitter I don't want 40 of your updates yeah on my screen exactly, exactly how Timmy
[6518.62 → 6524.46] described it I could not agree more i I would love to I'd love to echo your opinion there I'm going to jump
[6524.46 → 6530.22] off the twitter blitz for a sec here and I'm going to jump to a topic that I'm going to try to keep my
[6530.22 → 6534.86] anger contained as much as I possibly can for I know this man's going to have some trouble with it
[6535.50 → 6540.54] actually hang on one sec somebody just replied that said it only broadcasts to feed if someone
[6540.54 → 6551.10] is following the person you replied to that's interesting so if I retweet is I reply back to t
[6551.10 → 6555.74] I shouldn't pick this guy's name because I'm going to say that'll reply to me so everyone that's
[6555.74 → 6559.90] following me will also get that because i was just wondering in how he said that because
[6559.90 → 6566.14] because you're replying to both right so I think when everyone messages Linus and myself if I respond
[6566.14 → 6571.42] I think everyone following and the people mentioned you only see Twitter replies in your main feed if you
[6571.42 → 6576.78] follow the original person and the people mentioned so if I replied and the people mentioned
[6576.78 → 6583.74] I think it's or that people mentioned sometime well I don't know interesting we'll have to I'll
[6583.74 → 6587.18] have to play around with that we can all tweet each other later, and we're going to have to figure I would
[6587.18 → 6592.46] love to figure this out because I don't have that well I do don't get me wrong i I have a bunch
[6592.86 → 6597.50] but relatively I don't have a ton and I would love to reply to all these guys yeah it would be interesting
[6597.50 → 6603.42] to see like so when you say reply right yeah but like say this twitter blitz if I reply to somebody
[6603.42 → 6610.54] and I'm just going to pick somebody at random here if I delete your guy's twitter handles I wonder
[6610.54 → 6616.94] what happens yeah try it because I follow you so I should be able to you should be able to tweet it
[6616.94 → 6622.38] and once it's up I can tell you if I see it or not it would be good to know because it would make me uh
[6623.82 → 6628.70] less afraid to reply to everybody absolutely this is a sorry guys for dealing with us, but this is all
[6628.70 → 6633.74] something we're discovering it does not I follow Timmy tech I follow Timmy tech it did not just come
[6633.74 → 6638.70] up in my home feed and I went to his page and I saw it so that must work I used to get complaints
[6638.70 → 6643.34] maybe they changed something I don't know yeah that's really cool we're awesome virtual high five
[6643.34 → 6648.78] to Timmy we figured yeah well virtual high five to whoever pointed that out in the joy absolutely
[6648.78 → 6655.02] lets you know what I think a couple of people did uh Alec joy absolutely did big shout out to that man
[6655.02 → 6665.90] um that's cool um t, and he's a radio guy a couple of guys team red baby yeah he's got it in his logo
[6666.54 → 6672.94] oh he's an USC fan that looks it as well lets uh let's move on to the next topic this guy's awesome
[6672.94 → 6677.90] this Alec joy guy he's getting some uh let's let's follow that man right there okay let's move on to the
[6677.90 → 6683.34] next topic uh this one is the League of Legends player that posted nudes of his girlfriend online
[6683.82 → 6693.50] um and then blamed her effectively so what happened was he quote hacked unquote into her account he
[6693.50 → 6698.54] probably just knowing the password and typing it in is not hacking so many people say that
[6698.54 → 6705.82] but like I mean he probably just knew the password um anyway using I forgot my password and logging into
[6705.82 → 6711.42] their email and doing it that way is also not hacking yeah sorry he probably didn't actually
[6711.42 → 6717.10] hack it anyway he went into her League of Legends account and lost five games she's quite intensely
[6717.10 → 6722.38] into the game so that is actually quite a big deal because I believe these were ranked games um sometime
[6722.38 → 6728.70] later very likely unrelated even though it doesn't freaking matter she went and played the league of
[6728.70 → 6736.94] legends character lee sin playing a character in a game oh no that's horrible a character in a game
[6737.66 → 6743.50] anyway his response was that he was so enraged that he posted nude pictures of her that were shared
[6743.50 → 6747.82] only with him on his Facebook page which is a public Facebook page, and he is a figure in the league
[6747.82 → 6754.38] of legends community, so a lot of people saw it he left them up for three days I believe he left them up for
[6754.38 → 6759.26] three days until a fellow League of Legends player and I believe past star craft player same person
[6759.26 → 6765.02] correct destiny yes yeah past star craft player current League of Legends player he's not really a pro
[6765.02 → 6770.78] he's more of a personality either way threatened to release his personal information online
[6770.78 → 6777.10] so out of fear for his personal information being released he took down his girlfriend's nudes
[6777.10 → 6784.38] which is way more important what the hell so when I saw you link this thing I had to go read about
[6784.38 → 6790.46] it because I was like chuckling to myself, so the first funny thing is like I went to his Facebook page
[6790.46 → 6795.66] and just kind of looked through this stuff real quick uh first if you do some background on
[6795.66 → 6803.02] this guy he's like highly regarded as one of the best non-pro players yeah out there right um the
[6803.02 → 6808.94] other thing you notice is the guy is kind of psycho um and a lot of people said that the girlfriend
[6808.94 → 6814.30] quote unquote that he'd been dating her you know not very long let's just say um
[6815.98 → 6819.26] so if you know this is one of the problems where
[6822.22 → 6827.66] people play so many video games i I think just forget what real life consequences are yeah
[6827.66 → 6835.50] no they take everything in the game so personally um you know it's like your girlfriend breaks up with
[6835.50 → 6840.94] you uh you know if you're a guy you go to a strip club or get drunk, or you know hang out hang
[6840.94 → 6845.26] out with the guys and me at max level in a MMO you know whatever incredible
[6849.26 → 6856.94] yeah play 40 hours of Skyrim straight um but you know you you you kind of recede and then
[6856.94 → 6864.54] you know get over it and then you come on to the next yeah yeah um yeah I don't you know
[6865.58 → 6872.06] I think bad move the thing I read uh on one of the articles about that today was uh that they've
[6872.06 → 6878.54] actually banned him from League of Legends and from and from twitch and from twitch yeah so he kind of got
[6879.10 → 6884.22] decimated by two companies that I respect a lot more for this one thing that was posted August 10th
[6884.22 → 6887.82] this is this story has been around for a bit if some people are wondering why we're just
[6887.82 → 6892.46] covering it now the story has been around for a bit, but the information has been kind of uh
[6892.46 → 6898.46] scatterbrained, and we didn't really cover it now because it was just so messed up and I was so
[6898.46 → 6903.82] unsure about so many things but on the 10th he posted some YouTube videos to something and I think it's
[6903.82 → 6908.94] a song yeah, and he quotes I'm going to feel bad saying all this I'm gonna talk about it afterwards
[6908.94 → 6915.18] it's sad what society turns my long loving girlfriend into what I can't save her it's up
[6915.18 → 6923.10] to her to save herself okay she chose being a monster that just wants to hurt people from a
[6923.10 → 6927.82] loving caring girl what a shame all because of four pictures that didn't really become viral
[6928.38 → 6934.62] hell this hurts to say it hurts my brain until she made it viral herself and I only did it because she
[6934.62 → 6940.22] ignored me for three to four days and was doing things similar to what she's doing now I do not
[6940.22 → 6945.18] feel anything except bad for her because she doesn't realize how bad the things she is doing
[6945.18 → 6951.10] is compared to the one little thing that I did two of the most important things in life is knowing what
[6951.10 → 6956.94] forgiveness and sacrifice is sadly she hasn't learned those two words what those two words mean yet I'll
[6956.94 → 6962.38] teach him I will be waiting for her, I feel a lot of people want to teach him a lot of things in physical
[6962.38 → 6970.62] ways with fists um but well the other thing is he has like he has like 12 000 followers on his page
[6970.62 → 6976.14] did he not think that nude pictures were going to go viral and I don't think it was her it's its okay
[6976.78 → 6984.22] Sarah is the girl's name and Sarah you're not watching this but like it's not your fault you're not a
[6984.22 → 6990.06] monster get a restraining order and run like I'm sure she's already running because he's saying that
[6990.06 → 6994.94] she's ignoring him that's good keep running and run faster because this is not your fault and this
[6994.94 → 7000.14] guy's nuts like you don't need to come hang out with us, he won't get through the door yeah it'll be all
[7000.14 → 7008.46] right just like oh, oh it's just a really unfortunate story and uh there's so many
[7009.98 → 7014.94] one thing this is I'm going to try and add some comedy to this because it's mad he ruined it for so many
[7014.94 → 7021.34] dudes a lot of girls are going to read this and then that's not going to happen anymore I was just gonna
[7021.34 → 7025.82] make a comment about how please girl gamers don't think that this one jack
[7028.94 → 7032.78] just like because I mean I have why I have a daughter right I mean I don't want
[7033.74 → 7038.78] my daughter to have to deal with this kind of cup when she grows up right I watched how men and boys
[7038.78 → 7044.46] talk to girls this is like a kind of tangent off of this, but you know I watch how these you know
[7044.46 → 7050.46] jerks talk to girls, and it makes me wonder like where were their mom and dad to teach them proper
[7050.46 → 7055.66] manners when a lady's around honestly you know and I sound like an old curmudgeon now at this point I'm
[7055.66 → 7060.86] gonna sound like an old curmudgeon, but my belief is the majority of the time those two people the
[7060.86 → 7064.38] mom and dad weren't in the picture I can tell you Luke doesn't talk to girls like that I can guarantee
[7064.38 → 7071.90] you he doesn't I I don't it you know it's unfortunately it's because you know of that honestly because they
[7071.90 → 7076.86] don't have an excellent father figure like I'm sure you are it's its just it's just a sad fact
[7076.86 → 7080.86] and it's really too bad that there's so many League of Legends is so huge and there seems like there's
[7080.86 → 7087.02] so many sub pros or b pros, or we want to call them that drama and like the guy raising funds and was in
[7087.02 → 7092.46] a wheelchair who stood up during his stream and walked away and there's just there's just other
[7092.46 → 7098.78] ugly stories that that's very saturated it's really depressing when we're on this exceptional
[7098.78 → 7104.94] growth for the last two years let's say um of esports it's really sad that these things come in
[7104.94 → 7109.74] and really just knock us back a couple steps you know yeah well and I feel like a lot of these you
[7109.74 → 7115.90] know but let's be honest most of the people that are in esports I'm you know I'm generalizing here
[7115.90 → 7122.38] vastly but most of the people that are you know in esports didn't play other sports right and
[7122.38 → 7127.90] you know like playing little league and playing high school football like you learn to lose
[7128.70 → 7134.70] you learn to hate it, but you learned how to be a good sportsman, and you learn how not to lose next
[7134.70 → 7140.06] time and how to be on a team right and how to be on a team and I think you know a lot of these
[7140.06 → 7144.38] things with you know like these League of Legends especially like if you don't know the people you're
[7144.38 → 7150.14] playing with you can be a dirt because you're like whatever I'll just find other people to play with
[7150.14 → 7155.18] and you know screw you guys, and you know all this stuff, but you know I've never
[7155.90 → 7160.06] you know even like in all the time I was playing wow, and you know you deal with the pugs and
[7160.70 → 7164.22] you know this problem's been around a lot longer than I think it's been getting attention
[7165.18 → 7170.86] um you know if somebody's not good try to help them be better instead of berating them
[7172.14 → 7176.94] that's something that's kind of can I probably not gonna I want to jet in there for a second you
[7176.94 → 7180.78] guys probably noticed last time we were together you were in my fire shirt I do it's called pay
[7180.78 → 7184.94] call it's basically voluntary won't get into the details of the difference um I had an interview
[7184.94 → 7191.26] for a promotion that ended up receiving which was cool but I had a question that was who are the three
[7191.26 → 7198.14] most unskilled firefighters in your hall I've got a chief and a captain sitting there asking me this
[7198.14 → 7202.14] that's an extremely difficult question and I won't even get into what I answered but the follow-up
[7202.14 → 7207.10] question Timmy just to it what you said made me think of it was how have you helped them improved
[7207.82 → 7214.30] improve yeah mentoring is a big deal you know where I work too it's huge and that's you know how
[7214.30 → 7219.18] people grow in their careers where I work part of it is mentoring people that their skills aren't as
[7219.18 → 7224.62] good as yours and part of it is being mentored by somebody that has better skills than you being able
[7224.62 → 7229.02] to be able to take right, and you have to be able to take the other part of it too is you know you
[7229.02 → 7233.50] have to learn to be able to take feedback from people that are trying to be nice and not be a
[7233.50 → 7238.78] jerk back because I see that sometimes too where you know somebody will be like hey uh if you did
[7238.78 → 7243.26] this differently maybe it would help you and then the person's like well I know what I'm doing you
[7243.26 → 7247.66] don't know anything right so you have to be able to listen to people too and say like hey that's a
[7247.66 → 7254.78] great idea maybe I'll try that next time yeah absolutely yeah like uh and something else in here where
[7254.78 → 7262.94] is it to confront the confrontation between I think destiny and xj9 was recorded on Wednesday
[7262.94 → 7268.06] I don't remember where you can find it, but you can find it um you can hear xj9 trying to justify why
[7268.06 → 7276.46] he released the videos at it's its like a while in I believe, and apparently he says we literally said to
[7276.46 → 7283.58] each other if I really hated you the worst thing uh you could do is play lee sin and that's what she did
[7283.58 → 7291.82] oh no she probably didn't take that sentence in the same way you did even if you did it probably
[7291.82 → 7297.58] wasn't actually the worst thing and just because someone does something bad to you doesn't mean you
[7297.58 → 7304.46] need to do it back yeah so really I mean I'm a really depressing story well most men have probably
[7304.46 → 7310.78] had a breakup where it ends in I hate you I never want to talk to you again I'm just going to throw that out
[7310.78 → 7320.78] there yeah so you know I really find the whole story like if I was that guy's dad or would I just
[7320.78 → 7325.18] be like smacking him upside the head it's like oh my goodness there would be problems, but again that's
[7325.18 → 7329.58] the issue I'm willing to bet the dad's not in the picture at least not one like we have or like you
[7329.58 → 7334.78] are you know that's we kind of reiterate it here but that I believe that that's the source of a lot
[7334.78 → 7344.46] of issues I have twins I have a boy and a girl so that'll be interesting someday when uh well it's
[7344.46 → 7348.30] funny because they hit each other because they're two, and they don't know what they're doing
[7350.46 → 7355.02] my daughter pushed down my son and my son got back up and pushed down my daughter
[7355.02 → 7358.78] and I was like you know first I was like you know I told my daughter that that's not the right way to
[7358.78 → 7362.78] behave but then I took my son aside and I was like listen buddy you're going to get hit by girls in
[7362.78 → 7367.66] life, and it's going to suck, but you do not touch them right, and he's like two and a half, and he's
[7367.66 → 7374.70] like okay dad I don't understand yeah I'm graining that in early though because you know you treat
[7374.70 → 7380.38] women with respect I know it may be sexist but I don't care it's the way that I'm going to raise my
[7380.38 → 7386.06] kids in the way that I was raised by my parents so all right now something that I've been stalling
[7386.06 → 7391.98] for a little bit actually that we finally got to is we have build logs of the week and I don't
[7391.98 → 7401.66] think whaler's a yep click it okay um hopefully we can get that approved what wasn't me Linus just
[7401.66 → 7408.62] messaged me what question mark wasn't me I have no idea what he's talking about at all nobody does
[7408.62 → 7413.90] nobody does crazy one sec I'm gonna I have to I have to share the document which I'm not even entirely
[7413.90 → 7420.30] sure how to do uh sharing settings there we go we got build logs of the week coming just there was
[7420.30 → 7426.22] some problems with the document two seconds guys there we go yes I'm sure I clicked it three times
[7427.50 → 7431.18] okay you're shared on their now no you should download it and then full screen it from do
[7431.18 → 7438.86] you have PowerPoint on there I doubt it sorry snap this is an oh no i do yeah I saw that
[7438.86 → 7442.22] good okay download it 2013 so there
[7442.22 → 7449.90] we're going to get into build logs of the week, and then we will jump into the after party which will
[7449.90 → 7458.38] be obviously after so probably slideshow and then from beginning, and then we'll switch to yours
[7459.26 → 7463.90] man I used to use PowerPoint constantly in school it's been uh I use it quite often
[7463.90 → 7471.02] is this the new way we do things oh I see there we go all right give me one second so this first one
[7473.74 → 7478.30] apparently there's a slight update, but we're going to go with this one because it's been too delayed
[7478.30 → 7484.62] so the first one build logs go nice one is the nautilus reactor by lock alpha
[7484.62 → 7494.06] how cool is that this thing that is insane like I don't even know where to start that is
[7494.06 → 7497.50] so cool do we have the name of the guy who made this on the forum yeah go back
[7500.14 → 7506.22] lock alpha props that's how he pronounces it that is an incredibly good-looking machine
[7506.22 → 7510.46] submerged in oil looks absolutely incredible the attention to detail is just
[7510.46 → 7518.46] mind-blowing totally mind-blowing nuts it's wall mounted which is just cool because why not um this
[7518.46 → 7521.50] is definitely one of those things that's not a floor people these are vertical
[7522.06 → 7526.22] board this is wall mounted yes it's one look at the CD that's so cool its nuts
[7527.26 → 7533.10] I know it's it looks perfect that's incredible oh the CD even has a curve oh my goodness yeah
[7533.10 → 7537.02] yeah the like you have you guys you have to go see this on the forum
[7537.02 → 7543.82] like I know I see that every week does that look like jeez I love the three light bulbs on it
[7543.82 → 7549.18] probably take more power than the whole rest of the machine because of yeah yeah because of its
[7549.18 → 7552.94] four-factor because of those light bulbs and everything yeah it's actually wouldn't even be
[7552.94 → 7559.90] that surprised uh I'll give you one that is awesome why is the chat hidden have you guys seen that uh
[7559.90 → 7564.38] I think it was in Thailand where a guy puts water in a two litter bottle and a little bit of bleach
[7564.38 → 7569.98] and uh takes the light in makes the equivalent of a 500 watt light bulb you can barely look right
[7569.98 → 7577.18] at it, and it lasts for weeks that's so that's weird sorry anyway are you uh um the tubes in
[7577.18 → 7582.78] there are actually flowing uh which is actually pretty insane this coiled copper tube yep wow I saw
[7582.78 → 7588.14] that part of the build log he was filling it um it's just uh I don't even know what else to say
[7588.14 → 7594.70] about it, I might get something mixed up, so please go check out um that build log that's just
[7594.70 → 7602.78] absolutely insane and go next so now we're getting to titanium s by Paul tan he has made it in our build
[7602.78 → 7607.50] logs of the week before actually Paul tan is a little bit active on our forum which is nice so we
[7607.50 → 7615.02] jump into the next and just oh man this beautiful yellow are you recognizing things yeah that's a cosmos
[7615.02 → 7619.50] too right there yep it's actually pretty cool, and it looks you can see the fan through the
[7619.50 → 7623.90] fun which is quite interesting if you jump forward again sorry one second i have to look at this monitor
[7623.90 → 7631.66] real quick that's incredible I like how he did edit the uh the slide panel there in the front and i
[7631.66 → 7636.30] believe that is a fan intake actually yeah that he put up in the top there really cool
[7637.66 → 7643.02] the mob trays converted 90 degrees which is like my favourite thing about this building you can see
[7643.02 → 7648.06] a custom bracket there on the side wow and like just how everything comes in like check out the
[7648.06 → 7654.46] power supply like does that look like a natural alignment no just everything in this computer was
[7654.46 → 7659.58] just it's kind of ridiculous they took the bars off the top too which means he had to fill in those
[7659.58 → 7667.10] holes oh that's interesting this logo is also right it had the cooler master logo here yeah the paint job's
[7667.10 → 7672.38] just sick um he also probably could have gotten away with saying um
[7674.30 → 7679.50] bumblebee because it reminds me of bumblebee definitely yeah I'm trying to think of the name
[7680.46 → 7689.42] ah name of what the movie in that photo I mean yeah the side panel is like there's no window so the
[7689.42 → 7695.90] thing that impresses me here is like the massive attention to detail on the inside and then like man I know
[7695.90 → 7702.70] I'm cool enough to just put the side panel back on yep definitely um I actually think yeah I think
[7702.70 → 7707.82] it is there is a window yeah I think you put in a custom window there on the top yeah yeah oh wow
[7707.82 → 7713.50] and it doesn't come with that so, and he went to the edge with it which is not easy to do yeah that's
[7713.50 → 7719.34] really yeah see that's why I thought it wasn't a window the window in mine my father and I did and we
[7719.34 → 7724.70] just we just cut it in uh, but it definitely don't go to the edge going to the edge completely changes the
[7724.70 → 7729.90] ball oh completely actually going past it's going to be hard to see um, and you can't actually see
[7729.90 → 7734.54] with my mouse in this view but uh it's hard to describe it basically three quarters towards the
[7734.54 → 7740.46] front of the machine there's a bend in the door getting past that with creating a window is incredibly
[7740.46 → 7744.46] difficult the fact like he had to completely replace it fabricated himself if you're just
[7744.46 → 7750.94] going to cut it out like I did and place plexiglass in behind you cannot go past that bump without
[7750.94 → 7755.26] quite a bit of difficulty I know in mine I avoided it I stopped right before it so would not go around
[7755.26 → 7760.14] that curve right yeah if we jump forward again one thing wicked I wanted to point out too is the
[7760.78 → 7768.46] the piping uh there we go the piping it's just like that's so clean that's so beautifully done
[7768.46 → 7773.42] beautifully done uh one thing I noticed with Paul tans builds is there about both the builds this
[7773.42 → 7779.34] week actually are like art pieces oh absolutely like they're obviously functional but like that last one
[7779.34 → 7786.38] one with very bioshocky very like it's submerged, but it's submerged all this kind of stuff is like
[7786.94 → 7794.06] it's very much art, but then this is like modern like sophisticated Lamborghini bumblebee style art so
[7794.06 → 7799.10] it's its nice to be able to see two different degrees of what you can do with art and design while
[7799.10 → 7807.34] building a computer instead of like I bought a r4 and clean things and I have a clean r4 with Noctua
[7807.34 → 7812.06] and I'm like oh that's badass but like all the peoples have it which is cool, but it's
[7812.06 → 7815.34] nice to be able to differentiate yourself it's really hard to do a build like this like I know i
[7815.34 → 7821.90] spent we spent tons of time on my cosmos to build, and this one is considerably more intricate someone
[7821.90 → 7825.74] someone said in the chat modern art with a question mark I would say modern art, but there isn't like
[7825.74 → 7832.06] four faces coming out of the front I would say modern art, but it's so much better yeah I feel like
[7832.06 → 7839.74] that's a degrading comment yeah yeah that's what uh the hadron air I'm doing I'm actually
[7839.74 → 7846.30] going to take it to a body shop and have it painted uh like high gloss white inside and out because then
[7846.30 → 7849.98] it's like at least you know if you're going to do all this like trouble to take everything apart and
[7849.98 → 7854.78] that was where when Linus like re-powder I mean at least he put a wrinkled powder coat on it
[7855.42 → 7860.54] but when he really powders coated it I wanted to be like you took it all apart to make it the same colour as
[7860.54 → 7866.22] like let's make it like you know a different colour of black or something I don't know you know
[7866.78 → 7871.18] um make it stand out that because that's what you know like when you do all this work
[7872.22 → 7876.62] a lot of people never see this right I mean a lot of people just do it because they like to and
[7877.18 → 7883.66] they're going to see it, and you know that's the know I still have to be losing I still haven't
[7884.22 → 7890.38] posted a build log of my now year and a half old yeah cosmos build well it was for me and my friends
[7890.38 → 7897.10] and you know it was for fun yeah yeah more and more I mean it seems like you know
[7897.66 → 7903.42] engineers are a dying breed right and I think stuff like this where it's like hey you know I'm just
[7903.42 → 7907.98] customize a computer case but a lot of time you know when you're talking about you know like hey i
[7907.98 → 7912.86] have to make a bracket so that I can add this thing, or you know that's engineering people just
[7912.86 → 7917.90] don't realize it right because they're doing it for fun um or like you know 3d printing
[7917.90 → 7923.34] right like I have an I needed a piece for one of my pc cases and I just went over to a friend's house
[7923.34 → 7929.18] and like hey here's a cad rendering of what I need and he just printed it out on this 3d
[7929.18 → 7935.18] printer and I put it on my case how crazy is that that's awesome so what I will say like
[7935.74 → 7938.46] sorry oh go ahead what colour are you getting your head drawn in
[7938.46 → 7946.70] uh I think I'm going to do like it's its not an arctic white, but it's um same colour white that's
[7946.70 → 7954.38] on Porsche so it's its very like a clean white yeah um, but it's going to have a poly finish on it so
[7954.38 → 7961.42] it'll be shiny I drive around in Vancouver just on the outside so I see Porsche constantly and uh i
[7961.42 → 7966.38] wouldn't yeah I wouldn't even say it's glossy, but it's a very fine white I think i I like the idea that
[7966.38 → 7971.02] you described as the Porsche white because it's its actually kind of a different
[7971.02 → 7974.62] white than a lot of the whites that are out there right now yeah I think they call it snow-white
[7975.34 → 7982.62] okay the colour that i I chose but we'll see that's I know ha ha ha snow-white yeah
[7985.50 → 7989.18] all right well we've done the build logs of the week I'm going to do one more quick shout out
[7989.18 → 7993.66] uh for the folding and brink teams on the forum if you like the forum if you're on the forum you should
[7993.66 → 7997.82] check out folding and brink teams they're both for a good because you can ask whaler more about
[7997.82 → 8005.58] either one our folding team is like kind of insane I think we're still the fastest growing team um in
[8005.58 → 8010.78] the world which is just monstrous and awesome and our brink team is doing quite well as well so
[8010.78 → 8019.58] definitely check those out and on our way out because he stayed for I believe an hour and 13 minutes
[8019.58 → 8023.74] longer than he was supposed to somewhere around there if Timmy tech can say goodbye and say where
[8023.74 → 8031.34] you can find them then we'll sing right off again uh on Twitter at the tech TV and on YouTube at YouTube.com
[8031.34 → 8038.78] forward slash Timmy tech TV all right guys that is it for the wan show cold and i Richard and I will
[8038.78 → 8043.26] be doing an after party if you are you hanging around yeah I haven't I haven't asked him yet I don't
