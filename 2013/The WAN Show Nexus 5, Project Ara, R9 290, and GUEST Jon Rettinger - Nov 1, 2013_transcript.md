[0.00 --> 6.66]  to pick the right server so that's good welcome to the WAN show our weekly show where we
[6.66 --> 13.16]  WAN where we WAN we WAN on the internet which sort of another basically just another another
[13.16 --> 16.64]  word for that now I don't know what just happened to my internet connection on here but we're gonna
[16.64 --> 22.40]  go ahead and fire that bad boy up we have a ton of great topics for you guys today not the least
[22.40 --> 28.54]  of which is of course availability of the Nexus 5 which I actually picked one up so we're gonna
[28.54 --> 32.68]  we're gonna check that out although five inch phones are not really my forte I've actually got
[32.68 --> 37.18]  an Xperia Z1 that I'll be checking out over the next little bit I'm like turning into like this
[37.18 --> 42.04]  phone person I have phone and audio like try all these phones and stuff which is like not you I'm
[42.04 --> 47.32]  becoming disgracefully mainstream so don't worry oh I like phones and headphones don't worry I'm still
[47.32 --> 52.96]  interested in graphics cards tons of rumors circulating about the Radeon R9 290 as well
[52.96 --> 58.30]  as the GTX 780 Ti so we can talk a little bit about the rumors but we won't be able to confirm
[58.30 --> 63.88]  anything because we are still under NDA on a lot of those details which we do have we know
[63.88 --> 70.36]  everything our special guest this week is John Rettinger from Techno Buffalo also known as John
[70.36 --> 76.12]  for Lakers so he's gonna be joining us a little bit earlier than usual in about nine minutes so he's
[76.12 --> 81.64]  got a new baby at home so I can totally understand they need to be back home and doing what he needs
[81.64 --> 88.00]  to do as quickly as possible uh what are other topics for this week there's ps4 has some interesting
[88.00 --> 93.70]  audio stuff going on which is actually kind of like super disappoint they're not going to support uh
[93.70 --> 103.06]  mp3s can we put on our snobby pc gamer hats we are the pc master yeah pc master race has and our
[103.06 --> 111.28]  our pcs they support mp3s yeah they support mp3s indeed uh ps4 will have an audio streaming service
[111.28 --> 118.74]  through playstation which is totally unrelated to mp3s not really working yeah more on that later
[118.74 --> 122.68]  also phone blocks is going to be a thing now phone blocks is partnered up with motorola and
[122.68 --> 127.42]  project sticky which is now called project para so we'll talk about that soon all right so without
[127.42 --> 129.66]  further ado it's intro time
[129.66 --> 132.92]  you
[157.42 --> 163.90]  so guys our sponsor this week is hotspot shield you can get 20% off elite prices with offer code
[163.90 --> 171.14]  linus by signing up at bit.ly slash hs share hotspot shield is a vpn solution that works on your pc your
[171.14 --> 176.14]  mac your phone your tablet pretty much whatever you could possibly want and does what most vpn solutions
[176.14 --> 181.52]  do which is to obscure your ip address from the websites that you visit this makes it more difficult
[181.52 --> 186.18]  to track who you are and where you're from and also allows you to circumvent regional restrictions
[186.18 --> 192.10]  such as being able to access services that are blacklisted in your country or even getting around
[192.10 --> 198.76]  regional changes to services in your particular geography so for example canadians or europeans
[198.76 --> 203.50]  would be able to access netflix as if they were americans and get access to all that fantastic content
[203.50 --> 209.86]  that for some reason only americans are allowed to have well i understand why that doesn't make me
[209.86 --> 214.60]  have to like it no no no i do not have to like it so i'm going to let you get started with our first
[214.60 --> 222.66]  topic of the day which is active steam members surpass xbox live members so it surpassed xbox live
[222.66 --> 227.82]  members by like a lot i think this wasn't like oh they passed let's make an article immediately it was
[227.82 --> 234.38]  more like above they've been quite above for a while so active steam members is about 65 million xbox
[234.38 --> 241.56]  active members at about 48 million and psn is about 110 something to take away from this is that to be
[241.56 --> 247.02]  registered as an xbox live active member you have to have a gold or silver account um i don't know
[247.02 --> 252.02]  that many that people that have silver accounts but i haven't been on xbox live since like a long time
[252.02 --> 258.98]  ago so maybe that's more popular now um about 20 million of the xbox subscribers are paid subscribers
[258.98 --> 266.04]  so gold accounts um but then that pales in contrast to psn which is at 110 million because it's free
[266.04 --> 272.56]  so there is a ton of steam users and i'm happy with this news because i'm a bro for steam but i
[272.56 --> 277.70]  don't know how realistic it really is because i don't think it's actually a representation of how
[277.70 --> 281.58]  many people are actually playing on those devices yeah and it's one of those things where i look at
[281.58 --> 286.98]  it and i go okay i mean you look at app developers for example for android versus ios where what they'll
[286.98 --> 293.36]  say is okay yes we understand that there are a whole whack ton of people who are using android
[293.36 --> 300.18]  devices but the cold hard truth is that iphone users buy more stuff they're more invested in
[300.18 --> 305.04]  the platform so i would look at it and i'd go okay so steam you've got three times as many users
[305.04 --> 312.60]  no sorry not three times okay compared to paid so that is xbox live gold members you have three times
[312.60 --> 316.20]  as many users but how many of those people that are invested in the platform to the point where
[316.20 --> 322.00]  they're paying a monthly subscription to even have the membership level they do i mean to them what's
[322.00 --> 325.64]  another few bucks if they're buying apps or they're buying games or whatever else compared to
[325.64 --> 330.54]  someone who created a steam account and i think i think has a steam account i'm pretty sure the
[330.54 --> 335.14]  silver members can buy things they just can't play in the online servers but how likely are they to
[335.14 --> 340.50]  yeah how likely is a free member to to actually invest additional money versus someone that's already
[340.50 --> 346.60]  put down money and then that's kind of the same but not as steam because to be able to be set up on
[346.60 --> 352.36]  steam properly you probably have games right so you're not necessarily funneling your money through
[352.36 --> 357.60]  steam because you can get uh game keys elsewhere that's what i would have to assume that steam would
[357.60 --> 362.06]  still get some sort of a cut from them we need to find like one of those uh one of those cheap game
[362.06 --> 366.64]  key services to like partner with and do affiliate programs or something with their ways to get
[366.64 --> 372.46]  cheaper games and they pay huge commissions to influencers who are like hey by the way you're buying
[372.46 --> 377.32]  battlefield 4 anyway you might as well save 10 and then also like us we'll get some money too
[377.32 --> 382.04]  we got that would be a not bad idea we have to do that at some point i've been meaning to do it for
[382.04 --> 386.74]  a while i know logan uh logan has has one of those partnerships and he was saying that it's like
[386.74 --> 393.60]  really good okay all right all right anyway so the most played game on steam right now at the moment
[393.60 --> 401.72]  is dota 2 with 500 000 daily users which is a massive absolutely massive number and as much as i was
[401.72 --> 405.58]  tempering the enthusiasm a little bit there compared to how excited we could have been about
[405.58 --> 411.00]  this i think that the trend is definitely going in the right direction and steam isn't even the
[411.00 --> 417.36]  only platform i know it's the 800 pound gorilla compared to origin or you play but origin's getting
[417.36 --> 422.40]  bigger by forcing people to go on it though there's stuff like battlefield valve did the same thing yeah
[422.40 --> 428.38]  hello i mean i'm not saying it's it wasn't that long ago that gamers were equally upset with valve
[428.38 --> 433.04]  for the way that they were making them putting on my pc gamer master base i can't it doesn't like
[433.04 --> 439.42]  yeah okay whatever but uh yeah it wasn't that long that valve was doing exactly the same thing so we
[439.42 --> 444.46]  can't really criticize them too i mean we can criticize ea a lot yep but we do i think that yeah
[444.46 --> 449.66]  you play honestly you play is kind of terrible too i know i know it's it's very terrible okay i'm taking
[449.66 --> 454.76]  off my really hard to manage and it's like really hard to redeem codes and yeah all right so why don't we
[454.76 --> 462.16]  invite our special guest whose uh wife is apparently exactly like mine because uh she wants him home at
[462.16 --> 467.36]  a reasonable time tonight it kind of makes sense oh it makes uh all the all the sense in the world to
[467.36 --> 473.82]  defend the the the wife ladies out there oh oh absolutely i mean uh you know expecting your
[473.82 --> 480.80]  husband to be involved in the rearing of his child totally unreasonable obviously and i'm sure john will be
[480.80 --> 485.86]  with me a hundred percent on this because i'm sure his wife isn't watching this stream hello john are
[485.86 --> 494.34]  you live with us right now delayed reaction see i don't know if i'll ever oh there we go there we go
[494.34 --> 501.52]  how are you you guys there oh our splitter just fell so i uh you broke up a little bit there but let's try
[501.52 --> 508.22]  this one more time hello john from techno buffalo welcome to the show thank you very much for having me
[508.22 --> 514.38]  it's good to be here awesome so uh do you want to tell us a little bit about what life is like with
[514.38 --> 521.44]  the six week old bundle of joy that you have going on over there i live in constant fear of being pooped
[521.44 --> 529.54]  on you know you never would have thought that poop had a projectile range but i swear i saw poop shoot
[529.54 --> 534.64]  about six feet i mean and like with dead aim right on the wall
[534.64 --> 542.48]  it's been it's been good little uh our little guy will be uh six weeks on on sunday last night he slept
[542.48 --> 548.64]  for about five hours which seemed like one of the lottery so that means you slept for like three hours
[548.64 --> 553.78]  because you spent the first two hours laying there in fear that he wasn't actually asleep yet
[553.78 --> 560.16]  spoken like a man who's been there is he asleep is he gonna wake up what does he need is he dirty
[560.16 --> 566.12]  is he hungry is he can he is he breathing or like i don't know if you have pets but like your cat will
[566.12 --> 572.12]  meow or something and you're like you sit bolt up right you're like god damn it yeah so it's yeah so
[572.12 --> 578.20]  it's been it's been exciting it's been uh the biggest adventure um of of my life so far but it's
[578.20 --> 582.70]  been it's been awesome i uh i'm excited for new reasons to come home every day that is awesome so
[582.70 --> 592.52]  this is your first then this is number one our first our first baby uh baby boy uh nathan that is
[592.52 --> 597.62]  so exciting you know what i'm gonna do something terrible to you i'm gonna offer you advice if
[597.62 --> 603.82]  you'd like any advice i will take it really i will take it because honestly we got so much advice
[603.82 --> 608.68]  most of which was terrible that anytime anyone told us they wanted to give us advice on child
[608.68 --> 613.50]  rearing we told them to leave our house after a certain point listen i'll say this i know enough
[613.50 --> 619.20]  to know i don't know anything yet so listen i'll take it all right well i think the biggest thing is
[619.20 --> 624.26]  uh is you know what everyone else is gonna tell you treasure these moments i'm gonna tell you
[624.26 --> 631.20]  man ride it out hold in there because it gets a whole lot better around the first birthday and right
[631.20 --> 638.44]  now just sucks support support the lady because she needs it man dude i'm trying honestly i feel like i am uh
[638.44 --> 642.10]  like a high school transfer student like sophomore year to try to keep my head down
[642.10 --> 648.22]  you know and like just make it through the day is your wife uh if it's not too personal is your wife
[648.22 --> 654.80]  bottle feeding or breastfeeding she is uh she's going on natural so um okay i lack the i lack the
[654.80 --> 658.98]  equipment to to feed him although we're giving him one bottle a day of uh you know the frozen
[658.98 --> 664.94]  the frozen variety let me tell you lacking the lactation is probably good for you because it's one of
[664.94 --> 669.58]  those things where you can be like you know hon i'll get up and i'll and i'll change the baby
[669.58 --> 674.54]  and and bring him to you but i mean really that's all i can do so i guess i'll go back to bed after
[674.54 --> 679.56]  that if that's okay with you that's dude i hope she's not listening to the show but yeah i've definitely
[679.56 --> 684.56]  uh pulled pulled out like i'm sorry like like the well the well's dry here
[684.56 --> 692.20]  i can only i can only do what i can do all right so i know you've had i know for a fact you've had less
[692.20 --> 696.80]  time than you're used to in your life to pay attention to what's going on in the tech world
[696.80 --> 702.16]  but let's start with your article actually about the nexus 5 so i'm just gonna oh my goodness we
[702.16 --> 707.20]  don't have our guest lower third that's john he's he's joining us anyway so let's uh let's fire over
[707.20 --> 713.12]  to that article really quick here so it sold out in less than an hour is this about what you were
[713.12 --> 718.38]  expecting yeah i'm actually surprised it lasted that long if i remember correctly nexus 4 sold out
[718.38 --> 722.94]  sort of equally fast i mean google did a crazy job of hyping this thing up without really officially
[722.94 --> 728.40]  saying a word so everybody's expecting it kind of any minute um so yeah i was not surprised that it
[728.40 --> 732.14]  uh that it sold out and first impressions are it sold out for a reason it's a really great phone
[732.14 --> 738.24]  it looks really compelling considering the price point does it not yeah the price point's killer
[738.24 --> 742.32]  i'm actually i can't see but i'm holding it in my hand i'm holding it up to my my webcam
[742.32 --> 748.18]  that you can't see uh in homage 349 bucks is a killer price point you figure on contract
[748.18 --> 753.54]  two-year deal you know this would probably be about 150 to 200 phone so for the extra 150 bucks
[753.54 --> 758.10]  you know you don't have to sign a two-year contract which is um which is awesome you don't want to
[758.10 --> 762.92]  sell it the nexus devices you know hold their value similar to apple's um you know so sell it in a year
[762.92 --> 768.44]  it's it's a pretty uh nice phone uh you know i want to put it through its paces before i do a review
[768.44 --> 772.16]  we always sort of take a long hour with our reviews and we'll tell the audience how long we
[772.16 --> 777.08]  we use the device before we just sort of rush to get best seo and put up a review like four minutes
[777.08 --> 781.98]  later that is such a great approach and you know what um we've only recently started dabbling in
[781.98 --> 787.58]  phones a little bit because i was never really a phone guy and i mean the the perspective i bring
[787.58 --> 793.54]  is not the experienced phone guy perspective but what i do is i i i force myself to take out my sim
[793.54 --> 797.72]  from my phone that i use and put it in the new one and i kind of go if i'm not willing to do this
[797.72 --> 802.82]  then how can i really say that i reviewed this device if i didn't actually even commit
[802.82 --> 810.12]  to use the thing so i respect that so much because seo is great but it's not the be all and end all
[810.12 --> 814.92]  no thank you thank you very much it's a dirty secret in our industry that folks from other sites that i
[814.92 --> 820.64]  won't mention uh you know will rush to get a review up um without really using the device i uh again won't
[820.64 --> 824.66]  mention any names but i've been at events where you know we've been handed a phone and other
[824.66 --> 828.64]  publications have been handed a phone you know the exact same time yeah their review will go up
[828.64 --> 833.68]  the next day and we'll have cited 48 hours of battery life and you know what i'm not i'm not
[833.68 --> 838.92]  a math major but that does not add up and you know the funny thing is i think it's a lot of the i think
[838.92 --> 843.26]  it's a lot of the old media mentality here where these i think it's a lot of the traditional tech
[843.26 --> 849.14]  guys where they're used to something like a graphics card where all you have to do is benchmark it
[849.14 --> 853.72]  and you measure the power consumption you measure the performance and really that's all there is to know
[853.72 --> 858.58]  about it but to me a phone i go out of my way to actually again this is i'm not a hardcore guy i
[858.58 --> 863.28]  don't even really talk about the specs i go this is how it felt in my hand and this is what i thought
[863.28 --> 867.42]  of something i noticed that was different and that's all i really have to say about it and i think that
[867.42 --> 872.22]  there's room for the hardcore tech spec guys that are running all the benchmarks there's room for the
[872.22 --> 878.16]  guys that are doing the in-depth plus the real world i actually use this thing stuff like what you do
[878.16 --> 881.92]  and i think there's room for the casuals but the guys that really offend me are the ones that are
[881.92 --> 888.52]  saying things without actually validating it i could not could not agree with you more uh on
[888.52 --> 891.94]  that i mean you can't just make up numbers you can't say the battery sucks because we tried to
[891.94 --> 898.50]  play a video for 14 hours and died after eight it's not how people use their phones exactly you know i
[898.50 --> 903.10]  wonder if i can get through a full day with you know being on wi-fi for eight hours and an hour a phone
[903.10 --> 907.42]  call and can i get through a full day i'm not gonna spend most of my day watching you know 12 hours of
[907.42 --> 912.70]  video on my phone like give me this bad stuff that matter you just don't know a device until you
[912.70 --> 917.32]  actually use it and rushing to get stuff out i think makes our whole industry look bad it's dishonest to
[917.32 --> 922.46]  the audience let's talk about using the nexus 5 this is something that i've been thinking about for a
[922.46 --> 927.44]  little while i actually just recently got my hands on a moto x because i'm not high priority like you
[927.44 --> 934.92]  i actually have to buy most of my phones and my take on that was do we really need a 1080p screen in
[934.92 --> 940.64]  the 4.7 inch or 5 inch form factor what are your thoughts on this and maybe i will i will tell you
[940.64 --> 945.22]  this we we have the privilege of having access to pretty much every mobile device out there in our
[945.22 --> 950.02]  office it's it's a really it's a privilege and an honor it's a double-edged sword is what it actually
[950.02 --> 956.52]  is you know that yeah absolutely but one that i i really serve high and high esteem two of the
[956.52 --> 962.28]  people in our office are using moto x's if that tells me and they're using it as their regular phone
[962.28 --> 967.30]  when they have access to anything else um so if that tells you anything of the perception of the
[967.30 --> 973.52]  device it just works it works well um you know you don't have to have quad cord have a good experience
[973.52 --> 979.24]  on the phone you just don't that is so true i mean you know what this ties into something i really
[979.24 --> 985.68]  wanted to talk about with respect to nexus 5 as well is are we finally seeing the commoditization
[985.68 --> 990.88]  of the cell phone in much the same way that the pc was commoditized and then the laptop was
[990.88 --> 995.14]  commoditized and even every component of the pc i mean for a while i don't know how closely you
[995.14 --> 1001.32]  follow pcs but ssds and high performance ssds were a big deal for a while and then all of a sudden
[1001.32 --> 1006.60]  overnight samsung took over the market completely with commodity ssds that performed well enough
[1006.60 --> 1012.68]  and were priced very reasonably is this the beginning of the end where we see phones like moto x that don't
[1012.68 --> 1018.04]  compete on spec and we see phones like nexus 5 that come in and frankly take all of the margin out of
[1018.04 --> 1023.24]  the phone that guys like samsung have enjoyed for so long are we there are they just fast enough and
[1023.24 --> 1028.52]  are they commodity now so it's yes and no so yes for the technology that's out there right now it's no
[1028.52 --> 1035.52]  until the next ssd comes out it's no until everybody's rushing to have uh flexible displays and flexible
[1035.52 --> 1041.52]  batteries it's no until people are trying to get near field uh cameras built into devices um until the
[1041.52 --> 1046.16]  next big thing hits then yeah i absolutely think so but until there's that next whatever rush it's going
[1046.16 --> 1051.70]  to be whatever sort of fake rush they make the consumer think they have to have um you know i uh
[1051.70 --> 1056.58]  i think it's only a matter of maybe months and not years before that that next thing shows its face
[1056.58 --> 1061.62]  do you think the consumer is more savvy to the bullshit these days i mean look how long they've
[1061.62 --> 1068.20]  been trying to cram 4k on tvs down our throats without any content available and with extremely high
[1068.20 --> 1073.52]  prices on tvs in much the same way that they were used to being able to charge so much for a flat panel
[1073.52 --> 1078.84]  and then so much for a full hd one and then etc etc etc and people just aren't doing it anymore
[1078.84 --> 1084.70]  are we past that or do you think that mobile is not at that saturation point yet yes i think it's
[1084.70 --> 1089.04]  the industry so i think when it comes to tvs and a purchase that you make maybe once every 10
[1089.04 --> 1095.42]  uh people are maybe not smarter but pay closer attention with their wallet because those are real
[1095.42 --> 1099.68]  dollars i mean you're talking thousands and thousands of dollars uh so i think people aren't
[1099.68 --> 1104.80]  it is easily duped look at 3d like 3d is supposed to be the giant thing everybody's got to have 3d 3d
[1104.80 --> 1112.14]  3d 3d 3d and really not many people cared that much about 3d no i mean part of the problem to me
[1112.14 --> 1116.76]  was the implementations were so fragmented and so terrible i mean we see this happen in the industry
[1116.76 --> 1121.80]  over and over again where no one can agree on a bloody standard and then the whole thing flops
[1121.80 --> 1127.96]  yeah no you're absolutely right and when it comes to the mobile world i think customers are more
[1127.96 --> 1134.68]  easily duped uh and it's such a weird world in mobile people feel entitled to to things you know
[1134.68 --> 1140.42]  i signed a two-year contract two years ago for my phone where's my kitkat update uh or or so loyal
[1140.42 --> 1145.34]  to an operating system you know if you like apple and i like android we're mortal enemies i mean it's
[1145.34 --> 1148.92]  could you imagine that same dynamic when you go grocery shopping like somebody buys a milky way
[1148.92 --> 1154.04]  near a snickers guy and you just start like screaming at him like how dare you like snickers
[1154.04 --> 1160.12]  milky way is is obviously the best what's you you must be just a gigantic you know ass face
[1160.12 --> 1165.92]  that is fantastic because you know what it's funny because so many things on the internet are like that
[1165.92 --> 1171.44]  where if people actually behaved that way to each other i mean can you can you imagine being on the
[1171.44 --> 1177.88]  subway and seeing someone you know i mean okay let's say 10 years ago seeing someone with a sony disc
[1177.88 --> 1184.64]  versus a panasonic disc man and ending up in a fist fight over it no no i thought would have been
[1184.64 --> 1190.94]  like wow does that thing skip when you walk you know you're never like looking like what it is it
[1190.94 --> 1197.44]  is so crazy the internet mentality and sort of the entitlement that that people somehow feel it seems to
[1197.44 --> 1203.32]  be really exclusive to to mobile and maybe gaming as well yeah gaming is a big one strange phenomenon
[1203.32 --> 1210.50]  it's like i paid 60 for this game five years ago why isn't the game developer still supporting servers
[1210.50 --> 1216.74]  out of their own pocket yeah why don't i have backwards compatibility of ps4 with my ps1 masters of
[1216.74 --> 1225.16]  terras costum game i bought you know 48 years ago you know it's just it's a very strange uh strange
[1225.16 --> 1230.70]  world and i much as i try i still don't understand it and the funny thing is your entire job is to
[1230.70 --> 1236.24]  demystify it for other people so way to go smart guy yeah yeah but that's my that is my one job and
[1236.24 --> 1240.86]  i'm like i'm like i cannot figure you guys out like i love the audience they're incredible that they
[1240.86 --> 1245.48]  put food on my table give me a chance to live my dream but some of them i just don't understand the
[1245.48 --> 1250.76]  mentality like if that translated to anything else it would just it wouldn't work now let's talk about
[1250.76 --> 1258.46]  entitlement and support for lower end devices android 4.4 kitkat um there was a leak that we're looking at
[1258.46 --> 1262.64]  some unexpected improvements i'm just going to pull up the article here really quick this was posted on the
[1262.64 --> 1268.22]  forum by mg star so we're just going to go ahead and go back to our guest here so the original source was in gadget
[1268.22 --> 1273.86]  and we're looking at i mean obviously you've heard of this so why don't you give me your thoughts on this
[1273.86 --> 1279.76]  revelation that they're looking to optimize particularly memory use to the point where we could see devices that only have
[1279.76 --> 1287.10]  around 512 megs of ram still operate smoothly so i think as annoyed as consumers are with android
[1287.10 --> 1292.86]  fragmentations i think google is more annoyed with android fragmentation and i think they're trying to
[1292.86 --> 1298.38]  have more control uh over the operating system there's a big misconception that android is open source
[1298.38 --> 1304.66]  android is is not truly open source they released the source code but it's not open source
[1304.66 --> 1309.74]  uh so i think they're trying to uh limit fragmentation and they've done an incredible job
[1309.74 --> 1315.92]  of memory management uh with android 4.4 so hopefully they're saying okay 4.4 can run on more devices
[1315.92 --> 1319.58]  then app developers can be able to support more devices and they can make more money because more
[1319.58 --> 1326.32]  apps can be purchased on those older devices so it boils down to a dollars um decision for for google
[1326.32 --> 1330.16]  but certainly helps the consumer in the long run as well that's an absolutely fantastic point and
[1330.16 --> 1334.04]  actually ties into something we were saying before you joined us on the show with respect to steam
[1334.04 --> 1340.28]  members versus xbox live members where those steam members are the part of this fragmented ecosystem
[1340.28 --> 1346.06]  that maybe some game is released are you really pushing it out to 65 million potential people
[1346.06 --> 1351.28]  whereas on xbox you know that every single one of those members is actually capable of buying the
[1351.28 --> 1356.26]  the app or the game or whatever else it is that you uh that you happen to be that you happen to be
[1356.26 --> 1362.90]  looking at so how much of this do you think is actually focused on smartphones and lower end or older
[1362.90 --> 1367.84]  smartphones and how much of this do you think is gearing up for a google glass or smartwatch
[1367.84 --> 1373.90]  release coming in 2014 so that's the big one i think it's necessarily starting from here on out
[1373.90 --> 1379.16]  i think it's it's a two-prong attack i think it's gearing up for wearables um you know smartwatch
[1379.16 --> 1382.58]  and whatever you know google glass 2 whatever they decide to call their second iteration
[1382.58 --> 1388.76]  of it but beyond that i think it's also a clear shot for emerging markets i think they're looking
[1388.76 --> 1395.80]  at india in particular south america where maybe the lower spec android devices uh can get some market
[1395.80 --> 1401.76]  penetration um you know and also that potential um you know dollar from the play store and that's a
[1401.76 --> 1408.64]  very good point because i mean yeah it blew me away that in somewhere as technologically with it
[1408.64 --> 1415.66]  as taiwan i mean we're talking the manufacturing and design of all this crap goes on there and yet
[1415.66 --> 1423.36]  every cab driver's got a flip phone it's crazy in contrast though in korea almost every single person
[1423.36 --> 1428.82]  i saw had a note a note too right or like something else super baller and samsung's there so a lot of
[1428.82 --> 1434.32]  work goes on there so it's just it's so funny you mentioned that our um our managing editor uh roy choy is
[1434.32 --> 1438.76]  korean and we were talking about the difference of technology from country to country he was talking
[1438.76 --> 1442.80]  about he said exactly that same thing he says he went to korea all notes he couldn't believe how many
[1442.80 --> 1449.82]  people have these gigantic smartphones and how many women carry the gigantic you know smartphones uh it
[1449.82 --> 1453.74]  said it was just it's so interesting from country to country more than it to see what what permeates
[1453.74 --> 1459.26]  the culture yeah more than once i saw a chick walking around with like a clutch bag and as far as i could
[1459.26 --> 1464.96]  tell it was for her phone like that was it there was so many chicks and a lot of dudes as well but
[1464.96 --> 1468.92]  so many chicks with notes and giant phones that they held and worked with as tablets or
[1468.92 --> 1477.66]  something right i know right isn't that thing hilarious it is it is like a comic i loved using
[1477.66 --> 1483.96]  it just looking at me like what what is this thing on my face what is that what's that guy doing he's
[1483.96 --> 1492.20]  crazy okay so uh i think our last topic here is is a bit of a console topic and actually it's an
[1492.20 --> 1497.44]  ecosystem control topic as well so i'm just going to go ahead and fire this up on the computer here so
[1497.44 --> 1501.40]  everyone can see what the devil it is we're talking about so this was a tweet from michael mccallister
[1501.40 --> 1507.64]  that sent this over so it's actually the original link is to the playstation blog where they dropped an
[1507.64 --> 1515.76]  absolute bomb on ps4 audio format support yes so uh here luke why don't i let you give the rundown
[1515.76 --> 1520.32]  and then john i'd love to hear what you think of this particular method of ecosystem control so there
[1520.32 --> 1526.50]  was a topic actually on techno buffalo about this so i'm sure i'm sure he's on top of it um but ps
[1526.50 --> 1533.80]  playstation released a giant faq recently like huge and it is actually pretty awesome because it's nice
[1533.80 --> 1538.14]  to get some confirmation about things uh because this is kind of an issue you hear about this giant
[1538.14 --> 1542.64]  thing that's newly released and it's like oh well i have literally 80 questions and none of them are
[1542.64 --> 1546.78]  answered so it's nice that we got this faq but people started noticing things like the playstation
[1546.78 --> 1554.56]  4 will not support mp3s audio cds external hard drives or dlna people are just like what the heck
[1554.56 --> 1560.02]  one thing that they do support though is music unlimited a playstation service which can stream you
[1560.02 --> 1564.02]  music for a monthly fee and you can play this music in the background while you're playing games
[1564.02 --> 1570.10]  only 4.99 a month no less john i'm sure you have lots to say about this let's hear it yes i do so
[1570.10 --> 1574.02]  first i just want to say thank you to everybody that's sort of sending messages on on twitter that's
[1574.02 --> 1579.64]  um that's watching the show it's very cool to interact for live um so if there's ever been anything
[1579.64 --> 1587.20]  more sony than good design it's really loving proprietary formats like really love like really like in love
[1587.20 --> 1591.82]  wanting to marry and make babies with proprietary formats yeah i mean this is the company that
[1591.82 --> 1599.96]  brought us betamax minidisc um memory memory memory stick memory stick duo memory stick duo 95 pro duo
[1599.96 --> 1605.30]  the billion different varieties so i am not at all surprised with the music side of things and
[1605.30 --> 1610.30]  pushing their own silly services what was a little bit surprising was the external hard drives and sony
[1610.30 --> 1618.00]  said that they're limiting it to try and reduce piracy which okay i can i can understand um you
[1618.00 --> 1623.10]  know they all probably felt that was a big issue with with the ps3 uh they placated people a little
[1623.10 --> 1629.22]  bit by letting their internal hard drive be replaceable which it still seems a little bit silly just get the
[1629.22 --> 1633.30]  you know connector and you can throw an external hard drive anyway that it thinks is internal um
[1633.30 --> 1640.90]  so it seems like a very silly thing that i think will very quickly be rectified um i would say come
[1640.90 --> 1646.68]  like half a year down external hard drives will be allowed okay just do you think it'll be rectified
[1646.68 --> 1652.66]  because one thing i have to give microsoft props for is that they made all the most popular most
[1652.66 --> 1659.50]  unpopular decisions they possibly could and then swiftly backtracked on them sony has shown in the past
[1659.50 --> 1667.04]  that they are willing to make an unpopular decision and then just ride it out forever forever and i
[1667.04 --> 1671.66]  agree i give microsoft credit as well for for backtracking they could have run a marathon
[1671.66 --> 1678.90]  backwards uh for as quickly as they uh as they retreated on that um i do however think sony is
[1678.90 --> 1684.04]  really trying to be what they're calling considering like the anti-xbox this time um so i think they're
[1684.04 --> 1687.10]  going to take a different approach to ps4 and i really think that's something that's going to be
[1687.10 --> 1693.26]  rectified if the community wants it to be rectified very very quickly now sorry go ahead because i'm
[1693.26 --> 1698.04]  gonna i'm gonna go for a bit here so sure one thing to bring up too is it's not just music unlimited they
[1698.04 --> 1702.56]  also have i believe what's called video unlimited which i think is supposed to conflict and try and
[1702.56 --> 1706.20]  fight against netflix and that has a little subscription yeah good luck good luck with that
[1706.20 --> 1711.18]  yeah i know right yeah not really gonna happen but just putting that out there there's such a powerhouse
[1711.18 --> 1715.94]  now oh it's ridiculous here's my issue with the way that sony is viewing their competition
[1715.94 --> 1722.30]  as this sony versus microsoft head-to-head battle so they're ignoring wii u which they're right to do
[1722.30 --> 1728.62]  and they're also ignoring steam os they're ignoring steam os and they're ignoring android i've been saying
[1728.62 --> 1734.72]  this for a little while and i don't think this is the battle of ps4 and xbox one i think this is the
[1734.72 --> 1740.28]  battle of consoles and they're better off to band together and figure out what their value add is and
[1740.28 --> 1747.22]  deliver it versus open more open platforms like linux and open platforms like android where the
[1747.22 --> 1752.34]  barrier to entry for a game developer or an app developer or whoever else wants to be involved
[1752.34 --> 1756.62]  in that platform is much lower i don't know how much attention you've paid to something like nvidia
[1756.62 --> 1762.92]  shield but did you see their console mode announcement yes i've actually uh picked i'm actually
[1762.92 --> 1769.08]  staring at nvidia shield right now as we speak good um what are your thoughts i so i had a chance to
[1769.08 --> 1774.68]  take a look at the update you know a few days before it uh got pushed so there are a few things i
[1774.68 --> 1778.84]  see i actually agree wholeheartedly with everything you just said i think the big difficulty for
[1778.84 --> 1784.82]  developers is getting those games on television sets about things like the ouya and i think the shield
[1784.82 --> 1792.08]  and nvidia nailed it with the the control mapping yes so being a being able to take a game like nba jam
[1792.08 --> 1796.66]  you know that's an awesome game but it's kind of tough to play with touch and being able to just
[1796.66 --> 1803.36]  have that already be mapped for your shield makes it a very very compelling platform not to mention
[1803.36 --> 1807.54]  all the emulators you can download you know i traveled i was playing super mario brothers on my
[1807.54 --> 1813.76]  shield because it was just fun um and you know what we've seen this time and time again where the more
[1813.76 --> 1819.86]  that a platform tries to lock down and become anti-piracy the more the piracy friendly platform
[1819.86 --> 1826.40]  that crops up to take its place gets accepted because let's face it piracy drives platform
[1826.40 --> 1831.72]  adoption in a huge way and it's the elephant in the room that microsoft doesn't want to talk about
[1831.72 --> 1836.96]  about the xbox the original xbox it's the elephant in the room that you know microsoft doesn't want to
[1836.96 --> 1841.14]  talk about with the pc it's the elephant in the room google doesn't want to talk about with android
[1841.14 --> 1848.48]  but it's there yeah that's a very astute observation actually um i i completely agree
[1848.48 --> 1854.92]  with that with that statement you you are absolutely right i'd be curious you know and they say piracy
[1854.92 --> 1858.62]  what they really mean is we're not making enough money i mean that that's sort of the that's the
[1858.62 --> 1863.12]  between the lines is we don't care if you're playing our game for free we're sure that you're not
[1863.12 --> 1870.14]  giving us money to play our game um and and that's the issue i wonder though how much money these
[1870.14 --> 1874.38]  manufacturers sony microsoft are paying to developers to get exclusives microsoft obviously
[1874.38 --> 1879.62]  opened up their wallets like crazy get exclusive titles what what if they both agreed to stop doing
[1879.62 --> 1884.98]  that that okay let's stop with the exclusive deal uh you know if we own a studio so whatever if it was
[1884.98 --> 1889.44]  formerly bungie or whatever it might be then you know we'll make our own games but if we stop doing
[1889.44 --> 1895.02]  that and we stop pushing this ridiculous piracy that just locks down our console i wonder
[1895.02 --> 1899.96]  how that would change sales numbers and how that would change you know their end of day
[1899.96 --> 1906.48]  or a scary profits what about a scary sort of uh ceasefire on exclusive titles where they kind
[1906.48 --> 1911.38]  of go okay well let's work together to make them console exclusive and let's compete on the value
[1911.38 --> 1916.82]  add services like xbox live and playstation network and let's figure out how to extract our money
[1916.82 --> 1921.30]  there but let's stop fighting on hardware because they basically gave up on the hardware fight we
[1921.30 --> 1926.56]  saw that they both have the same bloody hardware in them for the most part ps4 yeah exactly the
[1926.56 --> 1931.08]  same and they're still sort of like backhand fighting each other you know i'm sure sony
[1931.08 --> 1937.84]  paid activision to make call of duty ghost 1080p only on the ps4 you know so people can think oh the
[1937.84 --> 1940.84]  xbox wasn't as powerful last generation it's probably not as powerful this generation
[1940.84 --> 1948.60]  but i would bet there was money it changed hands i was i can't back that up but i would i would bet
[1948.60 --> 1953.44]  that money changed hands so tell me this now that you've played with shield and console well do you
[1953.44 --> 1960.12]  have a kepler based g force um uh pc to stream games to your i've got a okay we've got a falcon
[1960.12 --> 1964.96]  here yeah oh yeah we we've been testing it and having a blast okay tell me this from an end user
[1964.96 --> 1972.84]  perspective if shield is 200 for what is effectively a a console that if you have a supported pc so
[1972.84 --> 1978.54]  remember shield is 200 with a supported graphics card so if you pay 200 for shield you get to
[1978.54 --> 1984.88]  stream pc quality graphics and man does it ever look good to handheld or to your tv with 1080p coming
[1984.88 --> 1991.84]  by the end of the year and the ability to use it handheld or steam os with its ability to stream from
[1991.84 --> 1997.06]  your pc as well so having one powerful pc in the house and being able to game on any tv versus picking
[1997.06 --> 2001.12]  up your console moving it around versus spending four hundred dollars or five hundred dollars or three
[2001.12 --> 2005.54]  hundred dollars whatever it is on a console plus extra controllers plus whatever you end up doing
[2005.54 --> 2010.62]  what is going to be in your living room six months from now if you had a crystal ball
[2010.62 --> 2015.24]  oh i mean the shield for sure i should say though the shield is 300 bucks if you want to buy it on
[2015.24 --> 2021.68]  its own yes that's important and it's not even available in every country yeah but i i totally see
[2021.68 --> 2025.64]  the value add and i give nvidia credit for pushing a product like this they know they're not going to
[2025.64 --> 2030.66]  make any money on yes it's it's a really cutting i i thought for sure they were never going to release
[2030.66 --> 2034.68]  this i thought it was going to be a reference hardware for tegra 4 um and i went on record
[2034.68 --> 2040.78]  and said that i was clearly wrong um i really give them i really give them credit i know the folks at
[2040.78 --> 2045.36]  nvidia very well they are committed this platform and they like you to see the future and they've done
[2045.36 --> 2049.52]  that same you know that same pitch okay what are you going to keep in the living room and if we stick
[2049.52 --> 2054.18]  with this we educate the consumer to know what shield does not just look at it as an android tablet
[2054.18 --> 2060.68]  with a controller you know they will get it being able to stream pc games that look ridiculously good
[2060.68 --> 2064.62]  anywhere you want are incredible if my wife doesn't want me sitting in front of my computer playing
[2064.62 --> 2069.44]  games i can sit on the couch sort of watch the baby you know and catch up with arkham origins
[2069.44 --> 2075.68]  sort of you know or anything absolutely or anything else i want and this is something oh sorry uh one
[2075.68 --> 2080.18]  thing that kind of catches me odd and i was wondering what you think about this was the release timing for
[2080.18 --> 2085.90]  different things to do with shield because i i think less people know that uh you can actually
[2085.90 --> 2090.50]  play it as streaming from your computer they know that it exists and i'm surprised that usually you
[2090.50 --> 2095.42]  announce things that have to do with the device before you release the device they mess that up
[2095.42 --> 2100.56]  and in shield's case they released shield and it was this hardware that everyone wasn't sure what to
[2100.56 --> 2104.34]  do with it like what it really does like why does it even have these different options blah blah blah
[2104.34 --> 2108.86]  and then finally they're releasing all these options after interest is actually almost waning
[2108.86 --> 2114.42]  yeah it's they've been taking a very weird approach they're trying to go organic and clearly that
[2114.42 --> 2118.96]  just translates that we don't want to spend a lot of money and a big like i mean it's true and do a
[2118.96 --> 2124.16]  big like blogger education push i mean so we had before this over the air update came out you know we
[2124.16 --> 2132.10]  had a huge um you know webex demo um talking about shield and they sent us um an external controller
[2132.10 --> 2136.32]  and hdmi keels hook it up to tvs and all that kind of yeah all that kind of stuff and they're really
[2136.32 --> 2142.50]  pushing it i think i think bloggers for some reason don't either get it or just don't care
[2142.50 --> 2148.12]  i think and i'm not sure why that is it's that emotional fandom that we talked about before this
[2148.12 --> 2153.64]  is a completely new completely different thing that i think a lot of the console versus pc guys
[2153.64 --> 2157.86]  i don't think anyone's happy about it because i think the hardcore pc guys look at it and they go
[2157.86 --> 2162.34]  well i don't need a console i don't need a handle blah blah blah blah and i think a lot of the console
[2162.34 --> 2167.92]  guys go well then i have to have a powerful gaming pc i'm happy with my xbox blah blah blah don't
[2167.92 --> 2171.02]  take away my console and the thing i think people don't realize is i've been saying this for a
[2171.02 --> 2176.18]  while this is the last generation of consoles in the form that we see them today and i totally agree
[2176.18 --> 2180.38]  with you and people tell me well well yeah i'm gonna sit in front of my computer no you're not
[2180.38 --> 2183.88]  gonna sit in front of your computer you're gonna sit in front of your tv the tv gaming experience
[2183.88 --> 2191.52]  is not dead but the console is dead and i think nvidia shield is actually just a pawn here i think
[2191.52 --> 2196.02]  it's i think it's a sacrificial lamb they're obviously going to lose money on the whole endeavor
[2196.02 --> 2201.80]  but i think they actually don't care if shield 2 or shield 3 or shield 4 exists because nvidia
[2201.80 --> 2208.36]  in their history is an enabler they are not looking to sell a graphics card directly to an end user
[2208.36 --> 2212.22]  any more than they're looking to necessarily sell a shield to an end user i think they created shield
[2212.22 --> 2217.30]  out of a need to build this because no one else was willing to do it i think they just did it
[2217.30 --> 2223.86]  and they went no we want handheld gaming uh combined with pc gaming combined with tv gaming and if we
[2223.86 --> 2229.08]  have to do it ourselves then fine but ultimately if someone else with tegra 6 releases their own thing
[2229.08 --> 2233.90]  i think they're happy with that yeah i actually agree with you i i i could not have said that better
[2233.90 --> 2239.84]  myself i completely agree with that you're the best guest ever you agree with me about things you're
[2239.84 --> 2245.32]  i mean when you're when you're right you're right i mean you're not you're not saying anything untrue
[2245.32 --> 2250.24]  man and i would anybody who knows me knows i love a good argument so i'm certainly not afraid to uh
[2250.24 --> 2256.56]  to speak up but i think you nailed it well you know what i would love to give you at least i we're
[2256.56 --> 2260.32]  coming up i don't want to keep you a minute longer because i totally understand the wife thing you got
[2260.32 --> 2265.70]  to go support her as best you can so we have three more minutes guys if you have any quick twitter
[2265.70 --> 2270.74]  questions for john that you'd love to hear him answer as fast as he can hit us up uh hit me up
[2270.74 --> 2275.06]  on at linus tech and john i'd like you to take the next couple minutes for any of our viewers who
[2275.06 --> 2279.76]  don't already know who you are which i think most of them probably do but talk about yourself and what
[2279.76 --> 2284.52]  you do and how it's great and how they can follow you always weird to talk about yourself i'm a geek
[2284.52 --> 2289.98]  i'm just i'm a geek who somehow managed to win the lottery and got the opportunity to do this for a living
[2289.98 --> 2297.20]  um you can you can check me out on youtube uh youtube.com slash techno buffalo uh i'm on on
[2297.20 --> 2302.20]  twitter at john j-o-n number four lakers which is an awful twitter handle i totally understand that
[2302.20 --> 2308.54]  really or you can check check out you know all of our all of our content um at uh at techno buffalo.com
[2308.54 --> 2314.14]  and we just talk about tech we're we're fans of technology and uh we have our passion that we get
[2314.14 --> 2320.94]  the opportunity to share with everybody now do you guys do a live show uh we do a podcast we used
[2320.94 --> 2325.58]  to do live shows we've told it live shows we really want to do more live shows it's just a matter of
[2325.58 --> 2329.28]  trying to find the bandwidth to do them but it's definitely like i say thanks a lot every year but
[2329.28 --> 2334.46]  it's definitely on our radar i want you to do a live show because you are fantastic live we have
[2334.46 --> 2340.40]  thank you we have some people on where you kind of go yeah you script everything and uh you have a
[2340.40 --> 2345.02]  hard time holding a discussion for 20 minutes whereas that is not the case with you at all you
[2345.02 --> 2350.64]  guys need to do a live show because i appreciate that i'm awful reading from a teleprompter i'm not
[2350.64 --> 2355.78]  an actor i'm really really bad so i mean all my videos are all done just whatever weird stuff comes
[2355.78 --> 2361.02]  out of my head all right so here we go we've got a couple twitter questions we're not going to keep
[2361.02 --> 2367.12]  john for much longer than a couple more minutes here no problem okay so joshua says john you were an
[2367.12 --> 2372.94]  awesome guest on the land show totally agree um here we go john from evan not really a quick
[2372.94 --> 2378.62]  question oh damn it evan okay what were the struggles you faced starting your own business over there
[2378.62 --> 2383.08]  sure and we're not we're not we're not on a clock i'm happy to answer the questions all right thank you
[2383.08 --> 2389.00]  thank you i mean the struggles were the biggest one i faced was you know so okay so now i'm 33 and
[2389.00 --> 2392.98]  people look at me as a 33 year old but they realized when i started this i was 25 26 years
[2392.98 --> 2399.52]  um not really knowing how business worked i love technology i used to go to best buy and walk
[2399.52 --> 2405.40]  around i trust myself um you know at the end of a long day um my biggest thing was when i when i
[2405.40 --> 2409.78]  first launched techno buffalo i didn't know about how to create a website i didn't know about code
[2409.78 --> 2414.60]  i had you know gotten a little bit of startup funds from friends and family i bootstrapped it all the way
[2414.60 --> 2419.22]  um and i hired a developer i said build the site he built it and said okay it's ready to launch so i
[2419.22 --> 2425.00]  figured great let's launch it um and the site crashed in i think it was less than a minute it
[2425.00 --> 2429.00]  was like 43 seconds it didn't crash because of crazy traffic it crashed because of god awful code
[2429.00 --> 2435.36]  so we had to burn through 40 of our startup capital i had just left my job this is 2009 in a bad economy
[2435.36 --> 2441.56]  to make videos for a living i had no income for essentially three months so the best long story
[2441.56 --> 2447.30]  short the best advice that i can give is know your industry you want to start a website know about a
[2447.30 --> 2452.96]  website i i was so like blindly ignorant i mean i look back and i just want to smack myself in the
[2452.96 --> 2458.90]  face um know know your industry before you get into anything um i had the benefit of being
[2458.90 --> 2464.48]  sort of just by dumb luck first to market so it was easier to get noticed and much harder now
[2464.48 --> 2469.50]  and it's a much more crowded field so if you want to get into youtube or tech world find your own voice
[2469.50 --> 2474.60]  let your personality come through don't be a robot don't copy anybody else's style find your own
[2474.60 --> 2480.16]  um and uh fight through all the hate that is absolutely fantastic advice especially that last
[2480.16 --> 2485.96]  thing any new employee here who is going to be on camera i actually am kind of an asshole to them
[2485.96 --> 2491.98]  intentionally um and the reason for that is because whatever i can say to you is not one-tenth of what
[2491.98 --> 2496.60]  the internet's going to throw at you and the bit about finding your own voice and your own style is
[2496.60 --> 2503.16]  so important because so many people ask me how do i be a how do i be a youtuber and the answer is is is
[2503.16 --> 2509.92]  is always to be passionate and understand what you're trying to talk about because otherwise
[2509.92 --> 2515.42]  people are going to people's people's bullshit radar is so sensitive these days they're not going
[2515.42 --> 2521.74]  to buy oh you're absolutely and don't fall in the trap of of selling yourself for reviews you know
[2521.74 --> 2525.16]  don't think you have to give good reviews because it's going to send you a product the audience knows
[2525.16 --> 2531.08]  be yourself on camera be genuine and um you know i think you guys will find success if you just follow
[2531.08 --> 2537.38]  that path all right uh this is just hilarious and i'm sorry to do this to you but uh please
[2537.38 --> 2546.32]  jogsy asks where do babies come from so here's how here's how it happens all right so you sit at home
[2546.32 --> 2551.12]  you know i don't even know how to answer that question all right all right all right all right
[2551.12 --> 2555.54]  all right here we go here we go hold on let's see if we got anything else john do you recommend the
[2555.54 --> 2560.50]  nexus 5 for the price or could you recommend a better phone for the price oh no no better phone for the
[2560.50 --> 2567.08]  price nexus 5 for sure yeah that's an easy one that was a really easy one yeah um will steam
[2567.08 --> 2573.74]  end in video will you try to let me see if i can see anything that uh uh okay we already talked about
[2573.74 --> 2577.76]  nexus 5 guys you're gonna have to go back and watch the archive if you want to hear about nexus 5 from
[2577.76 --> 2581.80]  john do you have any initial thoughts let's make this the last question here do you have any initial
[2581.80 --> 2588.10]  thoughts on the nexus 5 and its camera quality though we do funny you should mention that we actually
[2588.10 --> 2594.74]  just finished writing and filming a full test of the video and still camera quality uh on the next
[2594.74 --> 2598.98]  five so if you want to see that we'll have the post up actually tomorrow saturday on technobuffalo.com
[2598.98 --> 2605.52]  can we get a short teaser but i will give you a sneak preview it's good it's good it's not great
[2605.52 --> 2611.80]  okay that is very fair so guys make sure you check that out on technobuffalo tomorrow john you've been
[2611.80 --> 2617.44]  an absolutely fantastic guest thank you so much for joining us and uh thank you guys for having me i
[2617.44 --> 2621.08]  appreciate this was a lot of fun guys make sure that you're following john on twitter oh we should
[2621.08 --> 2625.88]  have his twitter handle in there john for lakers and uh you know harass him on twitter tell him how
[2625.88 --> 2630.26]  great he was because the more messages i see about how great he was the more likely i am to bring him
[2630.26 --> 2633.24]  back although i can already tell you we would be happy to have you back anytime you were
[2633.24 --> 2637.40]  listen i would love to be back and it's internet i don't do well with compliments so you do you do
[2637.40 --> 2642.74]  much better to just like yell at me awesome next time i'll make sure i have something we disagree on
[2642.74 --> 2648.84]  okay sounds good thank you guys very much for uh for having me it was a really a good time i look
[2648.84 --> 2652.96]  forward to doing it again hopefully sometime soon take care thanks a lot bye-bye all right let's uh
[2652.96 --> 2658.48]  let's move right along so let's move right into our sponsor message what a great guest he was yeah
[2658.48 --> 2664.20]  that was really good all right so our sponsor this week is whoops wrong one is hotspot shield
[2664.20 --> 2669.56]  so hotspot shield is a vpn solution it's great whether you're browsing on a mobile device like
[2669.56 --> 2674.66]  an iphone or an android device or whether you're using your laptop or your desktop and what a vpn such
[2674.66 --> 2680.24]  as hotspot shield does is it allows you to be more anonymous online with all the stuff going on right
[2680.24 --> 2685.36]  now with the nsa or other countries don't imagine that because you don't live in the u.s you're somehow
[2685.36 --> 2693.68]  immune because not not a thing online spying is a thing and while a vpn is not the be all and end
[2693.68 --> 2699.84]  all of online privacy it certainly helps we know this it makes you more difficult to track down
[2699.84 --> 2704.80]  exactly who you are and what your name is and where you live and it makes it more difficult to interfere
[2704.80 --> 2709.56]  with the things that you're doing online if someone is maliciously targeting your ip with any kind of
[2709.56 --> 2716.28]  attack you can get 20 off of elite pricing at bit.ly slash hs share and they do have a free trial
[2716.28 --> 2722.48]  of elite so all you have to do is head over to there try the free trial if you like it please use
[2722.48 --> 2726.66]  offer code linus when you when you buy it so that we get credit for sending you over there because they
[2726.66 --> 2731.82]  are very generously sponsoring the wan show and uh i mean i think it's i think it's a great fit just
[2731.82 --> 2736.92]  because i feel like our viewers are exactly the kinds of people who should be advocating this not even
[2736.92 --> 2741.22]  necessarily for themselves maybe you're very careful online you feel like you don't need a vpn
[2741.22 --> 2747.48]  make sure that your mom's using one or like your your idiot sister that goes everywhere is using one
[2747.48 --> 2752.82]  this is not a bad thing to think about so there you go guys vpns are important hotspot shield get a
[2752.82 --> 2759.38]  discount use offer code linus so i'm thinking we jump over the bbm topic and go directly to psus because
[2759.38 --> 2763.78]  we just talked about phones for yeah we talked about phones for a long time you guys want to talk about
[2763.78 --> 2769.32]  some hardcore pc hardware let's do that thing so we're going to jump into an anantec article about
[2769.32 --> 2774.62]  bronze versus platinum power supplies because we've talked about this before yeah um but we've just
[2774.62 --> 2779.70]  kind of like generally talked about the idea of it yes these guys actually run some pretty hardcore
[2779.70 --> 2784.64]  numbers these are hardcore numbers which is what anantec is fantastic for and if this page ever loads
[2784.64 --> 2788.20]  then ever why don't you why don't you go ahead and run them through some of the rationale so first
[2788.20 --> 2794.58]  what is 80 plus 80 plus is efficiency levels so if you're above 80 80 percent efficiency you get
[2794.58 --> 2801.22]  different rankings uh 80 plus platinum is like basically 90 plus but not quite so that is how
[2801.22 --> 2806.22]  much energy is wasted in the conversion from ac power which comes out of your wall to dc power which
[2806.22 --> 2812.60]  is what your computer uses how much is saved you're saving you're not wasting 80 no yeah yeah how much
[2812.60 --> 2816.62]  how much how efficient the conversion is okay so anyway what are some of these numbers looking like so
[2816.62 --> 2821.10]  we don't actually have the sheet up but i remember from memory when you're idling bronze compared to
[2821.10 --> 2826.34]  platinum uh you're saving about seven dollars and something remember these are going to be u.s dollars
[2826.34 --> 2830.56]  so wherever you are you can convert that as much as you want yeah and it really depends on energy
[2830.56 --> 2834.58]  costs in your area as well that's another thing to factor in and it depends on energy costs one thing
[2834.58 --> 2840.36]  is like i don't think our energy probably costs as much as anantec does um so our cost wouldn't be the
[2840.36 --> 2848.12]  same as this but oh canada yeah oh canada hydropower woo um so like there's there's a bunch of different
[2848.12 --> 2851.80]  factors in play which will make it different for where you live but basically essentially for where
[2851.80 --> 2855.46]  anantec did their testing you're saving about seven dollars and something when you're idling
[2855.46 --> 2861.40]  and you're saving up i think it's like 23 is that a year or a month a year a year and it's 24 7 operation
[2861.40 --> 2868.10]  okay so 24 7 operation idling for an entire year and then under load which is like heavy load
[2868.10 --> 2875.54]  24 7 for a whole year you can save about 23 25 bucks so my conclusion from this was if you're
[2875.54 --> 2879.60]  one of those guys on say the linus executives folding team and you're pushing your cpus and
[2879.60 --> 2885.02]  everything like 100 all the time and you expect to get three to five years of life out of your power
[2885.02 --> 2890.78]  supply then maybe not a bad idea look into high efficiency power supplies but if you're someone
[2890.78 --> 2894.80]  who's going to come home and game for two or three hours and shut your computer off other than that
[2894.80 --> 2900.10]  maybe don't shell out the extra money for the platinum power supply would get a cheaper one
[2900.10 --> 2903.94]  although one thing i have noticed is that silver and gold level power supplies are becoming cheaper
[2903.94 --> 2908.20]  and cheaper that's true they are and you know what honestly there are other things that you can do to
[2908.20 --> 2912.98]  optimize your system for power efficiency so hold on a second here is their actual graph where they
[2912.98 --> 2920.42]  compared the thermaltake light power 450 watt to the ea 450 earth watts platinum so those are the actual
[2920.42 --> 2926.20]  two power supplies that they're looking at and the funny thing about them choosing 450 watt power
[2926.20 --> 2932.86]  supplies for this test is that i have a a point about that more than changing the efficiency level
[2932.86 --> 2937.22]  the 80 plus rating of the power supply you're buying buying an appropriate power supply for your system
[2937.22 --> 2943.66]  could be could could actually save you more money because when you over buy 80 plus platinum and 80 plus
[2943.66 --> 2950.84]  ratings only factor in down to 20 load under that load there is no spec there is no requirement so
[2950.84 --> 2955.58]  it could be extremely inefficient at very low loads and if you completely overbuy your power supply by
[2955.58 --> 2961.66]  1200 watt power supply for a system that's going to pull 250 watts under load and like 45 watts or 60
[2961.66 --> 2966.12]  watts at idle you might be you might be getting the worst efficiency ever and you would never even know
[2966.12 --> 2971.70]  about it and like your highest efficiency isn't at that 20 where the graph starts it's a little bit in
[2971.70 --> 2974.98]  there so you want to be actually using a bit of your power supply for it to be really efficient
[2974.98 --> 2981.52]  all right so phone blocks has been making major waves so i think the first person who posted about
[2981.52 --> 2986.96]  project ara on the forum is mgs star so i wanted to give a shout out to you for posting in the linus
[2986.96 --> 2993.50]  tech tips news section of the forum but this is the original motorola post here i'm just going to go ahead
[2993.50 --> 3000.44]  and fire this up the official motorola blogs goodbye sticky hello ara so sticky was a truck that apparently
[3000.44 --> 3005.20]  trekked across the u.s or going somewhere with a bunch of rooted phones some 3d printing equipment
[3005.20 --> 3014.12]  and the goal was this my friends so much like phone blocks's goal is a modular phone design that is
[3014.12 --> 3020.26]  upgradable and can be tailor-made to a specific purpose that is the purpose of project ara so this
[3020.26 --> 3026.66]  is a whole lot of renders from what i'm looking at right now and not necessarily concrete proof that
[3026.66 --> 3034.86]  project ara is a real thing yet however um let's do a quick recap of of what the so the okay motorola
[3034.86 --> 3039.24]  is working with phone blocks in terms of publicity so in terms of publicity so go what are your thoughts
[3039.24 --> 3044.04]  essentially there was project sticky motorola was already working on this yes phone blocks and behind
[3044.04 --> 3050.04]  closed doors essentially phone blocks comes out and builds a huge community now motorola realizes that
[3050.04 --> 3055.02]  for this platform to be open and accepted by a huge amount of people they need a following these types
[3055.02 --> 3060.62]  of devices and these types of groups need a following is that playing audio nope muted okay so what they
[3060.62 --> 3064.98]  did is they decided to partner up with phone blocks who essentially came up with the same idea just
[3064.98 --> 3070.90]  slightly different um and grab that huge community that's there that that tweeted about this on the
[3070.90 --> 3075.02]  thunderclap that that's been following the videos that's been on reddit all that kind of stuff
[3075.02 --> 3079.98]  you're seeing a summary of all of that over here hey it was marcus brownley anyway go ahead so they want
[3079.98 --> 3086.18]  to grab all of this that you're seeing over here and attach it to their product basically so they partner
[3086.18 --> 3090.90]  it up with phone blocks so they can get the community of phone blocks and the hardware of motorola to come
[3090.90 --> 3098.94]  together and that's project ara now here's here's okay here's i'm gonna i'm gonna summarize the issues and i'm
[3098.94 --> 3103.90]  actually gonna use an article from a non-tech to summarize some of them because i love these guys so much and i just you
[3103.90 --> 3108.86]  should just go on their site every day that's what i do um anyway so they they summarize some of the
[3108.86 --> 3113.58]  issues so issue number one purely hardware perspective there is a trade-off between purpose
[3113.58 --> 3119.74]  building something as compactly and as efficiently as possible and building something that is more
[3119.74 --> 3124.54]  modular it will be bigger and it will be bulkier and it will be heavier trade-off number two that they
[3124.54 --> 3131.22]  bring up is regular regulations so fcc only tests single configurations for approval these are devices that
[3131.22 --> 3136.30]  send and receive signals so having them be modular and just completely interchangeable might actually
[3136.30 --> 3143.54]  be a showstopper depending on how how they can get individual can they get individual parts fcc regulated
[3143.54 --> 3147.66]  what if they work together and then they cause interference i mean i've seen stuff as ridiculous
[3147.66 --> 3152.42]  as a lamp and a baby monitor plugged into the same circuit that cause interference on the baby monitor
[3152.42 --> 3157.16]  this stuff is complicated and a cell phone is a hell of a lot more complicated than a baby they're
[3157.16 --> 3161.38]  going to have to get each individual part cleared but what about if you take this one and put it
[3161.38 --> 3164.52]  together and it causes some kind of problem but then wouldn't they have to test that to be able
[3164.52 --> 3169.44]  to clear it exactly yeah so it's going to be really complicated yes yeah but maybe maybe it can be done
[3169.44 --> 3175.24]  and then the final issue that they see is actually one of history where intel tried to do this with
[3175.24 --> 3179.92]  a project white book or whatever it was called hold on a second yeah white book where they wanted
[3179.92 --> 3187.14]  upgradable modular notebooks i mean intel has been an advocate of of pcs being a component business they
[3187.16 --> 3192.64]  make cpus and they make other parts like ssds motherboards not anymore but by and large they
[3192.64 --> 3197.36]  like that approach historically in their business they've wanted that but even they are not trying
[3197.36 --> 3203.92]  to do that on smartphone at all and they gave up on laptop because the market showed that what it
[3203.92 --> 3209.54]  wanted was tightly integrated design devices that are beautiful and sleek and slim and small and
[3209.54 --> 3215.34]  lightweight and highly highly integrated so i'm going to bring up a couple other things that that i think
[3215.34 --> 3221.22]  here so um here here's here's a big problem you know what oh where's that thread on the forum crap
[3221.22 --> 3227.10]  there was a great post on the forum that uh that i really liked about about phone blocks i didn't remove
[3227.10 --> 3233.62]  um yeah no i know you didn't remove it but uh i really wanted to give this user a shout out here because
[3233.62 --> 3243.70]  they did a great job of summarizing it but one thing issue is that much like the pc when's the last time you
[3243.70 --> 3249.10]  upgraded a component of a pc what i was just going to bring up is the main problem that i find is that
[3249.10 --> 3252.46]  um especially they're saying like developing markets all this kind of stuff blah blah blah
[3252.46 --> 3258.20]  whenever i see anyone upgrade anything it's pretty much always a bucket upgrade it's not like a single
[3258.20 --> 3262.62]  component uh that happens with computers that happens with practically everything i can think of
[3262.62 --> 3267.92]  to be completely honest um someone still kind of likes their car one component fails they're like
[3267.92 --> 3272.80]  it's fairly expensive to fix it i could but i'm just going to buy a new one and there's a lot of that
[3272.80 --> 3278.20]  and that mentality especially on the high end i don't really feel like is going to change and and
[3278.20 --> 3283.86]  there's the fact that a lot of the time it doesn't make any sense because by the time you're unhappy
[3283.86 --> 3288.72]  with something or by the time there's even a suitable replacement that you would even want
[3288.72 --> 3293.34]  there's probably a suitable replacement for some other aspect of the device that you also want
[3293.34 --> 3300.22]  i mean the evolutionary changes that happen between a galaxy device a galaxy s to a galaxy s2 to an s3 to an
[3300.22 --> 3305.22]  s4 they they change almost everything they put faster storage in them faster processor bigger
[3305.22 --> 3309.04]  screen better screen they do all these things at the same time and i think what's gonna what's
[3309.04 --> 3313.90]  gonna end up happening is much like on the pc where someone like i mean intel and amd and nvidia
[3313.90 --> 3319.32]  are all notorious for doing this oh uh buy this motherboard now and upgrade the cpu later no when's the last
[3319.32 --> 3325.00]  time you upgraded a cpu in a system come on by the time you're you know you're really just ready to
[3325.00 --> 3329.68]  spend money on that again there's a better motherboard and a better cpu and a better graphics card you take
[3329.68 --> 3333.74]  that old machine and you hand it off to someone else or even if you perform all those upgrades
[3333.74 --> 3337.34]  within a reasonable period of time you're still gonna end up with an entire computer or an entire
[3337.34 --> 3343.20]  phone worth of leftover parts they didn't go away there's a few use cases that i see for this there's
[3343.20 --> 3348.56]  um you better not steal mine there's the person that's extremely accident prone i know a few
[3348.56 --> 3355.44]  um that constantly break their screens um or constantly break x y or z but then we don't need a
[3355.44 --> 3361.54]  fully modular phone for that we just need an easily replaceable screen yes but none of them are and
[3361.54 --> 3365.66]  they're not really going in that direction except for this where you could take all the modules off
[3365.66 --> 3370.86]  the back buy a new base put all the modules in and it would probably be a lot cheaper okay because i'm
[3370.86 --> 3376.18]  assuming that i haven't looked a ton into project era but the screen is built into the base unlike
[3376.18 --> 3380.66]  phone blocks right uh project era they are talking replaceable screen right now okay okay didn't know
[3380.66 --> 3385.68]  that so you could just take the whole base all your modules replace the screen which is awesome
[3385.68 --> 3389.84]  because i know a ton of people that just break their screens repeatedly their phone's still fine
[3389.84 --> 3394.68]  it still works in the background i know a buddy actually like a day or two ago that broke his screen
[3394.68 --> 3400.42]  phone's still fine boots up all good can't see anything though so not really helpful that would be
[3400.42 --> 3405.60]  helpful for someone like that or someone who has no real interest in upgrading all the time but wants
[3405.60 --> 3409.96]  a phone that can text people call people and take really nice photos so they're going to spend a bit
[3409.96 --> 3416.54]  on their camera module and a bit on their storage module and that's about it so very specialty yeah
[3416.54 --> 3421.54]  now all of that stuff about how this is impossible that i just said oh yeah the last one that wasn't
[3421.54 --> 3426.20]  even brought up by an on tech but that i think is really important is who who's going to support this
[3426.20 --> 3432.22]  if i'm samsung and i'm used to selling people six hundred dollar or seven hundred dollar devices that
[3432.22 --> 3438.56]  are all made by me am i going to turn around and go yeah yeah motorola hey here we're going to make
[3438.56 --> 3442.76]  we're going to make really great components for your thing so that we can sell something for like
[3442.76 --> 3447.28]  30 bucks rather than selling someone a whole phone and so you can sell them the rest of the phone
[3447.28 --> 3452.24]  and i'm not just talking about samsung i'm talking about everyone and it's not even just i'm not
[3452.24 --> 3457.38]  criticizing samsung for it it's just a reality that would be terrible business but how much of the
[3457.38 --> 3465.06]  device can like okay one maybe samsung doesn't sell anything maybe samsung sells the parts to
[3465.06 --> 3469.24]  motorola you buy everything from motorola right why would they sell why would they even want to
[3469.24 --> 3473.70]  sell these parts to motorola to support this project we've seen awkward competitiveness behind
[3473.70 --> 3478.06]  the scenes where where samsung makes some device for apple and apple makes some device for whatever
[3478.06 --> 3482.12]  and we've seen that in the past where it doesn't seem to make a lot of sense but they made money but
[3482.12 --> 3488.06]  if it's not being integrated at a higher level sledge as from samsung or from a flash manufacturer or a
[3488.06 --> 3492.46]  camera manufacturer i mean that's the thing is all these guys are so vertically integrated to the point
[3492.46 --> 3497.60]  where they'll borrow from each other but you know if they can use their own sensor design or their
[3497.60 --> 3501.96]  own flash or their own i expect motorola to use as much as their own stuff as they possibly can
[3501.96 --> 3508.32]  but i think i think it's gonna have anything they don't build flash they don't build processors
[3508.32 --> 3514.42]  but it's google google makes flash do they not no i thought google's software only recently stuff
[3514.42 --> 3523.18]  flash makers are imft samsung sandisk like like intel these are the guys who actually oh so intel is
[3523.18 --> 3530.48]  the crucial intel uh joint project so no the actual manufacturing of any of this stuff motorola has to
[3530.48 --> 3536.02]  convince actual manufacturers who are actually selling this crap in their own devices to support
[3536.02 --> 3541.76]  this good luck chuck that's all i have to say i think if they're buying it it'll happen okay so with
[3541.76 --> 3548.02]  all of that said here's my last thing this is how it could work low-end devices yep this is where i see
[3548.02 --> 3553.66]  the potential i think that all the enthusiasts getting really excited about things like the phone
[3553.66 --> 3559.06]  blocks promotional video for the thunderclap are diluting themselves because that's not really what
[3559.06 --> 3564.90]  this is about in order to build a device let's say even within the next year or even two years
[3564.90 --> 3570.00]  we'll be looking so to build a device that could have a somewhat reasonable form factor somewhat
[3570.00 --> 3576.60]  reasonable weight and perform well let's say as well as a device today you would be looking at
[3576.60 --> 3581.50]  significantly downgraded hardware it would have to be much lower power it would have to be much
[3581.50 --> 3586.66]  smaller to make up for all the extra room that you're gonna waste with the housings that have to go
[3586.66 --> 3591.58]  around each component and with the interconnects that have to be built into it and the like in order
[3591.58 --> 3595.52]  to compensate for that we're going to be looking at low-end devices and i think that that's where
[3595.52 --> 3601.26]  something like project are it could be great for developing nations where i think all these
[3601.26 --> 3605.86]  enthusiasts are getting excited thinking that we're going to be building high-end uber phones
[3605.86 --> 3610.40]  that you can up look you i'll be able to upgrade it with a 16 core processor this and yeah sure if you
[3610.40 --> 3615.24]  wanted it to be this thick or whatever else we are very quickly reaching a lot of there's a great
[3615.24 --> 3620.96]  article on pc per about how graphics card performance is slowing down and we've seen explosive growth
[3620.96 --> 3625.24]  in mobile but for many of the same reasons that we saw explosive growth in graphics cards compared
[3625.24 --> 3630.46]  to cpus where it wasn't just that the manufacturing processes were shrinking the other thing going
[3630.46 --> 3636.22]  on here was that the manufacturers were learning how to optimize for this well phones are already
[3636.22 --> 3642.00]  not able to really benefit from manufacturing process shrinks in the same way that graphics cards
[3642.00 --> 3647.28]  and cpus were able to benefit for years so what we're seeing right now is some benefit there but a lot
[3647.28 --> 3652.50]  of it is actually just coming from optimization so once they get a good handle on how to design these
[3652.50 --> 3657.04]  things to get more power we're just going to have to draw more power and it's just going to have to be
[3657.04 --> 3661.60]  bigger and need more cooling and all that stuff and obviously moore's law isn't done yet not by a long
[3661.60 --> 3668.06]  shot but for for project aura to come in a reasonable period of time and be in a reasonable form factor i
[3668.06 --> 3672.96]  think it's a low-end play and i think it makes a ton of sense there where again replacement parts
[3672.96 --> 3679.92]  or low-cost upgrades or you know saving on electronic waste these are all great things that are going to
[3679.92 --> 3687.08]  happen but not at the high end the high-end you know developed nation consumer has shown time and time
[3687.08 --> 3694.44]  again that they want an alienware or they want a macbook pro or they want these highly integrated devices
[3694.44 --> 3700.34]  that have economies of scale on their side in terms of cost as well in addition to the manufacturing
[3700.34 --> 3705.68]  advantages and the fact that they're lighter and thinner and faster and etc etc etc not an alien
[3705.68 --> 3710.12]  where so much but uh although they're heavier they're faster i was talking about their laptops
[3710.12 --> 3715.16]  specifically they're faster yeah they'll have like sli gtx 680s yeah but other people make that
[3715.16 --> 3721.38]  yeah but i mean they're faster than a highly integrated solution yeah okay so i looked up the google
[3721.38 --> 3725.16]  thing and what i was confused about was how they were when they were selling enterprise drives and
[3725.16 --> 3728.28]  everyone was like how the hell are they doing that are they making their own flight yeah i didn't end up
[3728.28 --> 3732.32]  following that up so i thought they were making yeah okay i think the issue with volume today is
[3732.32 --> 3737.38]  that that's really far away we need to get that closer it needs to be like here um so we can well
[3737.38 --> 3741.66]  don't worry we'll reposition the mic next week i'll just yell more to compensate hopefully that makes
[3741.66 --> 3748.54]  up that's gonna make it peak because the gain's too high apparently so oh fine uh so moving right
[3748.54 --> 3754.64]  on to google smartwatch and google glass news this is of course a huge deal with the kitkat
[3754.64 --> 3761.06]  optimizations for low power devices with the my internet is apparently being a giant turd i have
[3761.06 --> 3765.82]  keep disconnecting yeah i have no idea what's the phone the issue is my notebook i think i think it
[3765.82 --> 3770.86]  needs a restart so um you know what well let's just let's just talk about it if you let me diagnose
[3770.86 --> 3776.52]  this you can talk about what's on there right turn it off and back on again um did you try to reboot it
[3776.52 --> 3782.92]  yes i did thank you it's awesome i actually expected you to kind of night through this whole
[3782.92 --> 3787.70]  topic okay pick another topic then maybe do some of our uh i tried see i'm so used to touch screen i
[3787.70 --> 3792.30]  tried to scroll his uh his laptop okay i don't even like it go down and do some of our rapid fire topics
[3792.30 --> 3798.16]  um can i do graphics cards no i want to get into that one so okay yeah don't worry guys it's coming
[3798.16 --> 3804.20]  uh give me one sec so amongst a few things one of the most ridiculous topics we have this week is
[3804.20 --> 3811.06]  actually the massive xbox that just took up space and uh kind of sat there in vancouver which is
[3811.06 --> 3818.00]  kind of good job you took up a parking lot in vancouver which is like super not helpful for all
[3818.00 --> 3823.26]  the people that have serious trouble parking in vancouver every single day thank you for that that
[3823.26 --> 3827.78]  was great i don't even go to vancouver and that drives me a little bit nuts but either way it's a
[3827.78 --> 3832.68]  hype machine so we're talking about it along as a whole bunch of other people um yeah we don't even
[3832.68 --> 3836.42]  care about xbox one i'm not planning to buy one someone asked me if i'm gonna do an unboxing i
[3836.42 --> 3840.82]  said yeah sure if i get a free one yeah i'm not gonna buy it though so i think your unboxing would
[3840.82 --> 3846.94]  be kind of hilarious i i'd just be like oh yeah okay so it's uh black it's a box i think that's
[3846.94 --> 3853.28]  an xbox logo on the front but uh it's not the first one so i don't know about that but yeah if you
[3853.28 --> 3856.94]  if you can see in that picture which i'm pointing at which you can't see here let me show you how to
[3856.94 --> 3864.02]  point at things oh go like this this way there you go there we go if you can see that if you can
[3864.02 --> 3868.64]  see the building behind it you can tell how actually insanely big that is yeah and like the lines on the
[3868.64 --> 3875.00]  parking stalls right here like it's huge it's ridiculous massive it's really freaking big and
[3875.00 --> 3879.44]  then they're just like yeah it's there so you can like go look at it and stuff i think you can also
[3879.44 --> 3884.10]  enter a contest to win an xbox one or something like that if you go there it's like you can do it
[3884.10 --> 3890.16]  online too though you can do it okay well so if you go to a url which is i was just planning on us
[3890.16 --> 3896.16]  clicking on it but it's xbox.com slash en dash ca slash one source if you go to that which is a
[3896.16 --> 3900.08]  little bit probably sounded weird and i said it really quickly but oh well you can put in your
[3900.08 --> 3904.56]  gamer tag and i think one or two other little bits of information you'll be put in a draw to win some
[3904.56 --> 3910.34]  stuff right now all we know in that group of stuff is an xbox one but there's some other like things
[3910.34 --> 3914.08]  that they haven't really said yet i'm gonna go out on a limb and i'm gonna say some of the other
[3914.08 --> 3919.98]  stuff will be xbox live subscriptions and probably controllers and more xbox ones or games or games
[3919.98 --> 3925.14]  perhaps games probably exclusive games probably exclusive just some assumptions this is like
[3925.14 --> 3929.94]  the i don't know i wanted to have this in here and i think you actually added it but i wanted this
[3929.94 --> 3934.50]  i didn't remove it because i thought it was hilarious that they just like were like oh yeah this
[3934.50 --> 3941.06]  is a big xbox in a parking lot in vancouver go look at it yeah do that thing hype machine yeah i don't
[3941.06 --> 3947.40]  know kind of obscene um okay so my uh my output's not working here unless it is which we are about
[3947.40 --> 3953.58]  to find out it is uh i can jump onto the next sure yeah jump onto our next one so a gas station clerk
[3953.58 --> 3959.88]  took a bullet to the chest and was okay and how he did this was by having his phone in his pocket
[3959.88 --> 3967.00]  apparently um so he didn't even actually realize that his phone like was broken or what was the cause
[3967.00 --> 3970.38]  of it until he took it out took it out of his pocket which i think is kind of crazy but he was
[3970.38 --> 3974.42]  probably on an insane adrenaline high because he was just shot at so he probably didn't feel it
[3974.42 --> 3980.36]  because of that but it's actually kind of nuts so his htc phone and i'm calling that out for a reason
[3980.36 --> 3987.62]  um blocked the bullet made him not be critically injured or died judging by the fact that a phone
[3987.62 --> 3993.60]  blocked the bullet he maybe not died but either way it wasn't going to be helpful yeah it wasn't going
[3993.60 --> 3998.94]  to be a good situation and then the phone made it a not bad situation i'm wondering how fast he's
[3998.94 --> 4005.40]  going to go out and buy another htc phone or how fast htc sends him a free phone or how fast exactly
[4005.40 --> 4011.56]  i bet you his next phone however he gets it will probably be an htc phone so there's a picture of
[4011.56 --> 4016.16]  the phone you can see the bullet entry right there and how it just decimated the screen but it's a
[4016.16 --> 4022.54]  bullet so yeah maybe what we should do is uh instead of drop test is uh criticize criticize htc for the
[4022.54 --> 4026.08]  phone breaking it's it's ridiculous i can't believe they think this level of quality is
[4026.08 --> 4030.14]  acceptable i know market what we should do is we should bullet test an xbox one
[4030.14 --> 4035.58]  that was part of the unboxing we should take it out to a range and just shoot the crap you have a
[4035.58 --> 4040.90]  you have a license right yeah yeah okay so we could legitimately do it without it just being like
[4040.90 --> 4046.44]  you can go to a range and shoot without a license a license is only for purchasing and um
[4046.44 --> 4052.16]  holding on to like having acquiring purchasing right right you can go shoot like you can actually go
[4052.16 --> 4056.70]  with someone into the woods to an area where you can shoot and if they own the gun you can shoot
[4056.70 --> 4061.22]  and that's not illegal oh okay not that any of this matters for the stream but yeah just putting this
[4061.22 --> 4064.94]  out there so we can yeah this would be no problem if we wanted to go shoot stuff okay so here's what
[4064.94 --> 4070.36]  i'm gonna have to do i'm just gonna have to build us um another little uh scene here so guys give us a
[4070.36 --> 4076.90]  moment here oh look at that we already have this one so then all we have to do is add screen region
[4076.90 --> 4083.82]  boo what did i do oh that was grabbed the side oh yeah i'm i got this there we go there we go
[4083.82 --> 4091.50]  okay so we're adding this green region all right so let's move into our next topic which is oh you
[4091.50 --> 4096.34]  know what i probably kind of did this wrong sorry everyone there we go let's go move ourselves into
[4096.34 --> 4105.46]  the corner and yeah explet go away okay google smartwatch and google glass news so this was from
[4105.46 --> 4111.40]  abc news new with new google glass and smartwatch google wants to be all over your body and they're
[4111.40 --> 4116.16]  not the only one if your name is slick oh because i want to be all over your body i knew where that
[4116.16 --> 4121.60]  was going all right so the explorer edition so first up glass explorer edition owners can invite up to
[4121.60 --> 4128.16]  three others so i actually reached out to marcus brownlee from mkbhd already i am assuming that this
[4128.16 --> 4132.14]  all works and goes according to plan i'm going to be getting my hands on this one it's available in
[4132.14 --> 4138.54]  new colors with a new earbud which i kind of look at and i go oh man that's going to look ridiculous
[4138.54 --> 4146.02]  but uh because i i see how it's necessary but i'm not i'm not super thrilled on it no i don't think
[4146.02 --> 4151.08]  there's a picture but i think it looks it looks pretty ridiculous um but a bigger thing is that it is
[4151.08 --> 4159.80]  now prescription compatible so that is pretty darn that is a really big deal um it is still sort of
[4159.80 --> 4164.36]  slated for a 2014 launch and they haven't said anything about whether battery life has been
[4164.36 --> 4169.26]  dramatically improved in any way so um i'm gonna i'm excited to try out explorer i'm sure you're
[4169.26 --> 4174.34]  excited to try it out yeah for sure and one thing is the new kitkat update actually helps with battery
[4174.34 --> 4178.68]  life a little bit in the bluetooth and wi-fi regions which if i remember correctly who knows where
[4178.68 --> 4184.44]  they were targeting that smart watches glass smart watches and glass so so i think if even if they
[4184.44 --> 4189.50]  didn't do anything necessarily to glass in particular for battery life i think it'll be slightly better
[4189.50 --> 4194.54]  just because of those two protocols all right so our next thing here boom sorry guys this is going to
[4194.54 --> 4200.44]  be a little bit inelegant for now um and that oh right i i went to it on my laptop because i'm used
[4200.44 --> 4206.92]  to that oh so i went to the load oh we're good we're good all right so google may launch a smartwatch
[4206.92 --> 4213.76]  before apple the new device would be quote unquote personal assistant so obviously the one in the
[4213.76 --> 4220.52]  picture guys is not a rumored google smartwatch that is the galaxy gear from samsung yeah so go
[4220.52 --> 4226.66]  it's interesting it kind of reminds me of how you treat your pebble actually which is more like
[4226.66 --> 4231.10]  you get messages there and you'll notice that someone's calling you and then you'll go get your
[4231.10 --> 4236.28]  phone it's not really necessarily like something to do a whole bunch of things on no and i think
[4236.28 --> 4240.72]  that's where samsung really went wrong yeah they tried to make it too much it's like oh well you can
[4240.72 --> 4243.52]  return text you can do this you could do you know what i can still do that faster on my phone
[4243.52 --> 4248.80]  yeah and i actually i i like the way you use it because i know even if you don't have your phone on
[4248.80 --> 4253.32]  you if i need to just text you something that i don't really need a reply back from i just need you to
[4253.32 --> 4257.50]  know i'll just be like boop boop boop and just don't even care it saved my bacon a number of
[4257.50 --> 4261.56]  times i was on the court playing badminton and i had left my phone off to the side as i'm apt to do
[4261.56 --> 4265.86]  and i got a message from my parents that they couldn't bring my baby home and i had to go get
[4265.86 --> 4270.80]  them so i was able to go get them before it was bedtime and then uh just today i had left my phone
[4270.80 --> 4276.56]  on the table because we were playing music off of it and uh i got a message from you i think and it was
[4276.56 --> 4281.84]  important and i was like oh oh balls where's my phone but that's that's good and it makes a lot of sense
[4281.84 --> 4286.28]  and i like that angle actually because that at least for now is where i think smart watches should
[4286.28 --> 4290.48]  be oh if google's watching or anyone's watching you know those things that you can keep in your
[4290.48 --> 4295.16]  wallet that set off proximity alarms like the proximo uh that needs to be built into smart
[4295.16 --> 4299.72]  watches so we can enable functionality where if i go too far away from my phone it'll uh it'll let me
[4299.72 --> 4306.10]  know so there anyone listening there's my uh all i want is 20 bucks okay so if anyone implements that
[4306.10 --> 4311.00]  idea 20 bucks and you can have a patent i don't care no not per no just just just 20 i just want 20
[4311.00 --> 4314.74]  bucks or even just buy me a pizza there i think that might have happened we'll call that done
[4314.74 --> 4318.24]  if someone's already done it then whatever no i mean oh someone bought us a pizza oh what i think
[4318.24 --> 4327.08]  brandon has it a pizza i think so what i'm pretty sure brandon do you have pizza i think he was
[4327.08 --> 4333.56]  letting us finish our topic whoa hey there's pizza wow okay so someone implement is going to implement
[4333.56 --> 4343.00]  this idea oh so it's from the forum there you go oh thank you what is it celebrating i don't think
[4343.00 --> 4350.58]  anything how did they get this address i know how i didn't give it to them i know how it was you oh
[4350.58 --> 4357.50]  well thank you guys very much for the pizza so uh because because it's what the alpha male does
[4357.50 --> 4363.04]  i'm going to eat first while slick has to uh while slick has to talk about our new topic i think
[4363.04 --> 4367.32]  there's specific rules that you can't have any i don't know if those rules stayed no too bad
[4367.32 --> 4375.12]  so the faa is loosening the rules for e-devices on airline flights this was posted by delon's
[4375.12 --> 4379.56]  dellon's whatever man i don't know what to tell you delon's okay so there's a picture of someone
[4379.56 --> 4384.44]  using a laptop on a flight and all i have to say is about freaking time and then i'm having a piece of
[4384.44 --> 4388.20]  pizza yeah it should have happened a long time ago it's been kind of ridiculous even when i was a kid
[4388.20 --> 4393.12]  playing game boy color on the phone on the on the plane sorry on the phone um when the lady would come
[4393.12 --> 4401.24]  by and tell me to turn it off i'd just be like what really like even as a kid how does what no there's
[4401.24 --> 4405.72]  no way this i'm gonna take down a plane with my game boy like that's ridiculous and it's been kind
[4405.72 --> 4410.58]  of crazy forever one thing that i think is nuts about this is that there's so much crap going on right
[4410.58 --> 4417.48]  now and like the senate had to get behind this to push it through like couldn't you do other stuff
[4417.48 --> 4423.22]  like i'm happy this happened and i do actually i don't think it's important necessarily but i think
[4423.22 --> 4427.92]  it was ridiculous that it existed and i'm happy it's gone and it should have been gone i just don't
[4427.92 --> 4432.54]  think it necessarily needed the like i don't think it should have been required the amount of
[4432.54 --> 4439.38]  yeah that's ridiculous it should have been so simple now it's not like all the devices all the
[4439.38 --> 4445.60]  time so phones are still not allowed um unless they're in airplane mode and i think they're still
[4445.60 --> 4450.30]  asking for certain things during taxi and takeoff and you know what some of the concerns i kind of
[4450.30 --> 4454.78]  understand having a bunch of laptops and like tray tables down and all this stuff going on
[4454.78 --> 4458.34]  yeah when you're when you're landing and things could be flying around in an emergency
[4458.34 --> 4465.70]  heavy devices so like this laptop would be you'd have to stow it which makes sense because all like
[4465.70 --> 4472.08]  i think it's 90 of the problems happen within 10k of landing or taking off so if if there's a higher
[4472.08 --> 4476.08]  possibility of a problem stow your device that could knock someone out i get that but on the other hand
[4476.08 --> 4481.22]  if i'm like if i've got my earbuds in and my phone's in my pocket come on man i mean honestly i do it
[4481.22 --> 4485.90]  anyway i usually wear a hood when i fly so i just put my hood on and then i have my earbud going around
[4485.90 --> 4489.88]  the other side and then i just have my phone in my pocket and there's no there's no amplification
[4489.88 --> 4493.92]  of the signals by having that many of them wi-fi is going to be allowed now and i've had people
[4493.92 --> 4497.62]  saying why would you want wi-fi on a plane i can think of a hundred reasons to have wi-fi on a plane
[4497.62 --> 4504.50]  ds multiplayer um you can stream ds multiplayer is sweet i know right uh you can stream using like
[4504.50 --> 4509.16]  to your smartphone using those little like external hard drives that are battery powered this is something
[4509.16 --> 4514.78]  that i do all the time uh no it's fantastic all right so moving on to our next topic which i would
[4514.78 --> 4518.52]  normally open up on my laptop but instead i'm gonna open it up over here because for whatever
[4518.52 --> 4525.10]  reason my output's not working i i blame displayport even though i love displayport so this is something
[4525.10 --> 4530.58]  that it's hard to even call a rumor with a straight face uh this was tweeted to me by steven toe
[4530.58 --> 4541.22]  and it's from overclockers.co.uk where some guy if you scroll down where's his gpu z shot i think it's uh
[4541.22 --> 4549.56]  no catalyst control center yeah okay so r9 200 series etc etc etc ah yes here so his frequency is wrong
[4549.56 --> 4555.30]  okay so there's there's hint number one and then i don't know if we see stream processors here
[4555.30 --> 4562.52]  there we go so the frequency is wrong and the number of where are the stream processors i don't see
[4562.52 --> 4569.68]  them it must be here maybe they're not anyway the frequency is wrong this is according to the rumors
[4569.68 --> 4576.04]  which it's really hard to call rumors with a straight face now uh radeon 290 instead of a 290x
[4576.04 --> 4584.92]  so a retailer in europe managed to accidentally ship a an r9 290 to a member of overclockers
[4584.92 --> 4591.04]  obviously the guy's like yeah i ordered a 290x so i'm gonna exchange it but not until i've
[4591.04 --> 4596.48]  benchmarked it my favorite part is like people are seem kind of unsure and he's not releasing a ton of
[4596.48 --> 4602.94]  information and then all of a sudden he's like gpu z photo of the box photo of the card like
[4602.94 --> 4610.52]  yup it's pretty epic now there's an issue with this a lot of the time when we say okay but bear in mind
[4610.52 --> 4615.02]  guys these are early benchmarks actually there's not going to be that much of a difference especially
[4615.02 --> 4621.10]  with cpus when we see that i mean they always had it every single time somehow tom's gets a sample
[4621.10 --> 4627.40]  like six months early go back and look at all of those and it's basically the same performance i
[4627.40 --> 4633.30]  mean someone like intel has finalized pretty much everything and they're working on fine tuning for
[4633.30 --> 4638.02]  like the last six months leading up to a launch that's how they project launch days a quarter in
[4638.02 --> 4641.74]  or two quarters in advance because they know it's done i don't actually find graphics cards to be the
[4641.74 --> 4646.46]  same they're ramping up production graphics cards are a little bit different yeah where particularly the
[4646.46 --> 4651.02]  hardware was probably done a while ago but the drivers could be being tweaked in the days leading
[4651.02 --> 4657.40]  up to the launch or even the days after the launch so whatever benchmarks that he's run i know for a
[4657.40 --> 4663.78]  fact that those performance numbers may not have very much to do at all with how r9 290 performs i
[4663.78 --> 4668.78]  thought you're going the other way and i was like whoa whoa whoa whoa no no i mean so so guys take them
[4668.78 --> 4674.62]  with a grain of salt but until we know pricing and the real performance of r9 290 we won't know
[4674.62 --> 4682.28]  sorry i got something in my eye the whole story all right r9 290 and like it it could be it could
[4682.28 --> 4690.44]  be accurate could be accurate it's all speculation right now yeah all right so moving on to our next
[4690.44 --> 4697.22]  topic this is another rumor this was posted online as tech tips forum and uh it's got the classic fry
[4697.22 --> 4703.70]  gif shut up gif sorry shut up and take my money the rumor and which we can't verify is that the
[4703.70 --> 4714.92]  geforce gtx 780 ti has 2880 cuda cores all right so that if it were true would be more than geforce gtx
[4714.92 --> 4719.54]  titan so here's all the rumors you guys can check out the thread it was posted by you better not
[4719.54 --> 4725.00]  and of course um the you better not thing is we better not discuss anything that we're under nda
[4725.00 --> 4730.26]  about so all we can say is this is what's in that thread there are rumors out there on the internet that
[4730.26 --> 4738.02]  it'll be available in three gig six gig and 12 gig configurations um although the galaxy images are
[4738.02 --> 4743.14]  actually pretty interesting are they is it well yeah it was it was galaxy images i think that showed
[4743.14 --> 4748.78]  like three different configurations um there's stuff that's no surprise like support for nvidia surround
[4748.78 --> 4754.46]  and adaptive v-sync that i think we're probably i mean okay i'm not gonna say it but i think it would
[4754.46 --> 4759.08]  be stupid if something like that was even under embargo but there you go guys the rumors are out
[4759.08 --> 4764.80]  there our card is here we've been briefed on it and we are very excited to bring you coverage of it
[4764.80 --> 4771.18]  as soon as we can but uh that is all we can really say for now what we can say is that with everything
[4771.18 --> 4777.96]  that's been going on lately between amd and nvidia man shots fired shots fired back shots returned i mean
[4777.96 --> 4783.36]  will these it feels like one of the ships has to sink they're gonna run out of cards or they're
[4783.36 --> 4789.18]  gonna run out of bullets with all the launches and pricing tweaks and performance tweaks and
[4789.18 --> 4794.12]  everything that's going on it is an exciting time for graphics card technology right now and next week
[4794.12 --> 4799.16]  we i think we're gonna finally see all the dust settle and all the cards will be on the table and
[4799.16 --> 4804.60]  we have a lot of videos coming out next week a lot of plans like battlefield 4 performance roundups
[4804.60 --> 4809.84]  stay tuned for that through the roof we have we have so battlefield 4 we have uh two different gpu
[4809.84 --> 4814.08]  tests coming we have gpu tests coming tonight which is going to be like really really early drivers
[4814.08 --> 4818.30]  aren't optimized yet he's determined to do it tonight it's like not shot yet right it's not shot
[4818.30 --> 4823.22]  all the performance testing you spent like the last two days i'm it's releasing tonight i'm not losing
[4823.22 --> 4829.08]  all that work there is a resolution tonight two days worth of benchmarks real in-game playthroughs which
[4829.08 --> 4833.42]  is what we do all cards overclocked which is what we do guys stay tuned it's gonna be awesome
[4833.42 --> 4839.04]  yeah and like yeah the drivers are not optimized yet and there's a few things and because of that
[4839.04 --> 4843.20]  reason we're gonna have another gpu follow-up once the two other cards that are coming out
[4843.20 --> 4850.70]  ish sometime in the future are out we'll have a follow-up then all right brothers and sisters
[4850.70 --> 4859.58]  this is a bit of a direct response to a particular twitter follower who keeps trolling me about well i
[4859.58 --> 4863.90]  shouldn't say trolling keeps harassing me what word should i use you know the guy i'm talking about
[4863.90 --> 4869.84]  right alexander i don't know what is this even all right this is the uh this is the uh forgotten oh yes
[4869.84 --> 4876.34]  yes yes okay who keeps getting on my case about not talking about the positive things about bitcoin
[4876.34 --> 4882.12]  because typically it only really makes news for us when something disastrous happens like it turns out
[4882.12 --> 4887.42]  that however many percentage of the transactions were drug related or it turns out this or it turns out
[4887.42 --> 4892.00]  that or some exchange shuts down that's the only time we really talk about it so now just for you
[4892.00 --> 4898.32]  man we are going to talk about one of the most positive things that could possibly exist about any
[4898.32 --> 4910.52]  currency this guy buys 27 worth of bitcoin is now worth about a million bucks which is amazing so what he did
[4910.52 --> 4916.68]  was when it was worth around i think it was like 880 000 ish yeah he sold out he cashed in at about
[4916.68 --> 4922.22]  a fifth one fifth of his coins and then bought an apartment in like one of the nicest places where
[4922.22 --> 4930.30]  he lives which is like sweet he bought 5 000 bitcoins in 2009 for 27 bucks and the only reason
[4930.30 --> 4936.44]  he bought it was because he was interested in encryption and i think he was doing like a paper
[4936.44 --> 4941.12]  or something yeah yeah i'm just trying to just trying to find it yeah working on a thesis paper about
[4941.12 --> 4947.70]  encryption was introduced to the bitcoin and was like i'll buy a few just to see kind of how it works
[4947.70 --> 4953.76]  uh saves his wallet password somewhere forgets it and leaves it there uh eventually heard about how
[4953.76 --> 4958.68]  exploded it was hunted for his password found his password oh my god i have basically a million
[4958.68 --> 4965.44]  dollars amazing so there you go man stop bugging me on twitter about it now all right we've got some
[4965.44 --> 4969.70]  more uh i think that's it for let's go back to our to our headline item to make sure that we discussed
[4969.70 --> 4974.78]  everything um bbm okay but that's not one of our headline ones so we we've covered all that stuff
[4974.78 --> 4982.08]  yep um oh yeah yeah let's do bbm yeah all right we jumped over too much phone stuff so bbm got i think
[4982.08 --> 4987.38]  10 million 10 million downloads in the first day now there's a few kind of interesting speculations
[4987.38 --> 4991.92]  about this actually this was posted by the point blank on the linus tech tips forum if you guys
[4991.92 --> 4996.36]  aren't a member go join the linus tech tips forum yeah we had some people show up at our meetup who
[4996.36 --> 5001.20]  weren't members so we chastised them thoroughly i've noticed a few of them are already members that's
[5001.20 --> 5007.50]  good yeah they did well to do so um so one thing that i kind of was interested in when i first read
[5007.50 --> 5015.58]  this was there was that massive amount of copy paste purchased reviews so how many downloads
[5015.58 --> 5020.86]  are legitimate and how many are actually 10 million on the first day because if i'm blackberry
[5020.86 --> 5027.02]  i'm probably pretty clever with respect to spoofing ip addresses or faking downloads of something yeah
[5027.02 --> 5032.50]  so they got a lot of downloads i don't know if it was actually 10 million but i have seen a lot of
[5032.50 --> 5036.58]  people like just friends of mine and stuff talking about it and download it and using it so they are
[5036.58 --> 5041.82]  getting a lot of downloads i don't know exactly how much it is it is actually pretty cool a few main
[5041.82 --> 5045.40]  things that i want to point out that it actually does is you don't have to give out your phone
[5045.40 --> 5050.28]  number to be able to use it which is awesome if you're selling stuff online or just like using
[5050.28 --> 5054.36]  craigslist or anything like that or if you're someone like me who wants to communicate with
[5054.36 --> 5060.16]  you know uh followers or whoever else you don't necessarily want phone calls yeah so that's actually
[5060.16 --> 5064.92]  very cool uh picture picture sending doesn't suck picture sending through text messages just
[5064.92 --> 5069.90]  sucks and yes expensive and is expensive and there's other services for this but
[5069.90 --> 5074.10]  that is just you can have benefits on two different series i mean that's something that drives me crazy
[5074.10 --> 5080.14]  the carriers had every opportunity to just crush this whole i message and blackberry messaging
[5080.14 --> 5087.40]  thing by offering more features better security and i mean come on the actual amount of data it cost
[5087.40 --> 5093.18]  them that like the rates that they charge for texting they allowed this whole thing to exist when
[5093.18 --> 5098.18]  they could have just made texting free and not had to bother with any of this and like picture test
[5098.18 --> 5104.66]  texting is terrible yeah and always has been why is it terrible i don't know it's ridiculous
[5104.66 --> 5109.96]  better attachment support you can send like excel documents and you can send all this other stuff
[5109.96 --> 5114.84]  which is really cool and it's encrypted end to end it's encrypted for you and then it isn't decrypted
[5114.84 --> 5119.52]  until it hits the other person with the phone and it's apparently not stored on blackberry servers i think
[5119.52 --> 5124.10]  pretty sure um so that's actually really cool if you're someone following the nsa stuff and you really care
[5124.10 --> 5127.82]  about all that kind of stuff and there's a whole bunch more that's just all i felt like listing
[5127.82 --> 5135.06]  right now um so my thing go ahead my thing personally is why the hell didn't this happen
[5135.06 --> 5141.80]  years ago and why the hell didn't they release their encryption stuff years ago oh like their business
[5141.80 --> 5147.46]  grade yeah they should have just flipped gears like i don't know how everyone didn't notice they
[5147.46 --> 5152.64]  should have just flipped gears became a software company because they're good bbm is good their
[5152.64 --> 5157.24]  encryption thing was good they would have been really successful and now they have this massive
[5157.24 --> 5162.26]  company of hardware stuff that no one cares about and the thing is they could have sold the entire
[5162.26 --> 5167.92]  ecosystem to corporations i mean it's not just guys remember it's a much bigger picture than just
[5167.92 --> 5173.60]  selling individual cell phone users you know um a secure platform or secure way of operating their
[5173.60 --> 5178.90]  phone or a secure messenger because you can sell the back-end servers that drive the whole thing which
[5178.90 --> 5184.08]  they were already heavily invested in so you could you would have allowed yourself to not let android
[5184.08 --> 5188.68]  and apple or android and ios catch up to you you would have allowed yourself to maintain that dominance
[5188.68 --> 5193.56]  there and built a niche but come on i mean who could have who could have known that they just didn't
[5193.56 --> 5199.56]  stand a chance that android was going to get so much better so fast years ago they were already dead
[5199.56 --> 5205.56]  okay like they've they've been dead and flopping around for so long which is what i don't understand
[5205.56 --> 5209.80]  like yes there was a while there where they were fighting they released the the bolt whatever i
[5209.80 --> 5216.48]  don't remember the yeah the 9300 yeah and they were like kind of etching along but then for so long
[5216.48 --> 5222.04]  after that they were nothing like why not just slip gears or keep producing the hardware whatever
[5222.04 --> 5226.10]  maybe you gotta convince investors that it's a good idea to do something like that as well and i mean
[5226.10 --> 5230.68]  how do you convince people that you know a free app is the way forward for your company but the
[5230.68 --> 5236.16]  encryption and servers and stuff not free app the bbm thing maybe that happens later yeah but the
[5236.16 --> 5239.74]  encryption and server stuff should have happened a lot one way or another guys definitely check out
[5239.74 --> 5244.94]  bbm um not because we're canadian and we really want blackberry to survive but just because
[5244.94 --> 5252.62]  you know it's cross-platform which is great i message is fantastic except that what it only works
[5252.62 --> 5258.04]  with other people who have ios devices are you freaking kidding me apple it's like yeah i i'm going to
[5258.04 --> 5262.46]  convince all of my friends and family that they must use iphones because i want to use i message
[5262.46 --> 5268.52]  it's ridiculous anyway all right let's move on to the next thing dell laptops dell issued a recall
[5268.52 --> 5274.50]  because they had laptops that smelled like cat pee um this is don't worry this is a quick topic we're
[5274.50 --> 5277.74]  not going to talk for too long about this but how did this make it through qa
[5277.74 --> 5284.50]  honestly like honestly what happened i think that was one of my first comments on the document was
[5284.50 --> 5290.98]  like what happened so this was posted by chill x nate on the forum so the bbc is reporting that
[5290.98 --> 5295.70]  dell's latitude 6430u ultra books have an interesting characteristic you won't find in any macbook air
[5295.70 --> 5300.88]  the palms rest palm rest emits an odor that smells like cat urine an issue with the manufacturing
[5300.88 --> 5306.26]  process is thought to be to blame now the funny thing here is you actually have to contact dell and
[5306.26 --> 5311.00]  you have to still be within warranty in order to get a replacement now it's a business oriented
[5311.00 --> 5314.36]  ultra book can you imagine walking into a business meeting and smelling like caffeine
[5316.20 --> 5321.16]  i mean i have a router that smells like bo which is funny enough but then a laptop that smells like
[5321.16 --> 5325.88]  caffeine you can get all kinds of smells out of a faulty plastic manufacturing process and that's
[5325.88 --> 5330.92]  apparently what happened here it's not a reliability issue or anything like that it's just hilarious
[5330.92 --> 5335.00]  and it's not bad for your health people speculated about that it got a little bit crazy but it's actually
[5335.00 --> 5338.04]  it's not a problem for you guys you guys are looking for it all right so our last main topic of the day
[5338.04 --> 5344.28]  before we move on to um some of the some of our forum topics and all that is this video right here
[5344.28 --> 5351.16]  this was actually tweeted to me by at rtev guys remember tweeting things to me sometimes works but it's
[5351.16 --> 5357.48]  much better and i'll love you a lot more if you post on the forum in the news section because we actually
[5357.48 --> 5363.24]  have shifted to almost exclusively browsing for news in the forum because we figure what you guys care about is
[5363.24 --> 5367.72]  what you want to hear us talk about and and honestly the news section has gotten so much better oh it's
[5367.72 --> 5372.60]  so much better pretty much everything ends up there anyway it's so it's so good i mean our forum community
[5372.60 --> 5377.64]  does a great job of maintaining it i mean linus tech tips forum news section is my home page so
[5379.00 --> 5383.00]  that's how i stay up to date on things which is fantastic to be able to say that about the uh about
[5383.00 --> 5390.60]  the community's done there so this video flexible high definition caacos displays so check this
[5390.60 --> 5399.00]  shiz out guys this youtube video right here i hope oh i did but oh yeah yeah yeah okay good here we go
[5399.00 --> 5406.68]  so let's go ahead and we're just gonna um i think i'm gonna watch twitch chat because i don't know about
[5406.68 --> 5413.32]  the audio okay so check this out guys that works until now with oxide semiconductors reliability was
[5413.32 --> 5418.28]  generally probably check out the way that this display wraps around so you could see notifications on
[5418.28 --> 5423.64]  the top of the device it's got buttons okay so hold on let's let's just go back and look at it again
[5423.64 --> 5428.36]  so you guys should definitely check out this video so it's got buttons that sit here on the side and
[5428.36 --> 5432.04]  they've got a cool close-up that shows you how you might how you might press that i mean this is an
[5432.04 --> 5437.40]  entirely different way to operate your device and then they were also showing off where's the curved
[5437.40 --> 5444.84]  battery a curved ah yes bendable battery design right here that would be huge for wearable tech tech
[5444.84 --> 5451.80]  combined with curved displays curved batteries you could be making bracelets or armbands or all kinds
[5451.80 --> 5458.60]  of crazy awesome wearable technology that really is whether anyone whether you think so or not really
[5458.60 --> 5462.60]  is the future i mean i get a kick out of all the speculation about will these guys have a smartwatch
[5462.60 --> 5468.20]  will smartwatches be the next yes yes yes it's done it's a foregone conclusion and this is absolutely
[5468.20 --> 5473.08]  amazing and like one thing about that too is you can bend it around your wrist if it's flat you can bend
[5473.08 --> 5477.72]  it around your wrist 10 000 times apparently before it becomes a problem and you saw their
[5477.72 --> 5482.36]  bend test there so that's actually pretty cool another crazy thing that they had was like i don't
[5482.36 --> 5488.36]  remember the exact specs but let me see here a 13 and a half inch 4k resolution screen that weighs 10
[5488.36 --> 5492.92]  grams go watch that video it's like four minutes and like pretty epic a lot of the time i start
[5492.92 --> 5496.44]  watching a video and i'm like okay skim skim skim i just watched the whole thing i was like i need to
[5496.44 --> 5501.00]  see this because it's amazing the uh link for it will be in the wan show doc at the end you want to start
[5501.00 --> 5506.20]  downloading the bill logs of the week uh yeah sure is this is it uh yeah oh here
[5507.00 --> 5513.08]  oh for crying out loud at least we have office on this computer that'll help yes we do okay yay
[5513.08 --> 5517.88]  office which is still the best so we actually have a bill logs of the week this week and it is pretty
[5517.88 --> 5525.32]  epic as normal not that surprised um we've changed a little bit of the way that we do it uh by suggestion
[5525.32 --> 5531.40]  by whaler and dave um my moderators who found a better way of doing it so we actually have a little
[5531.40 --> 5536.68]  bit of hardware specs along with the name at the beginning so if there's anything that stands out a
[5536.68 --> 5541.72]  little bit we could point it out here the main thing being that he went naked on his case which
[5541.72 --> 5546.12]  is his brother named his desk the plank and it's basically just all sitting on his desk this is a
[5546.68 --> 5553.16]  24 core four processor folding machine which is just absolutely beast well that's one way of doing a
[5553.16 --> 5559.24]  computer case so it just kind of sits on his desk this is a new way of doing a desk computer
[5560.92 --> 5566.28]  don't even bother bolt it in just you know wood isn't particularly electrically conductive so
[5566.92 --> 5571.72]  it's probably fine as long as dust isn't an issue and he doesn't accidentally zap it then uh
[5571.72 --> 5576.36]  this is an interesting cooler layout that we got this is a cable that isn't plugged into anything
[5576.36 --> 5581.16]  the optical drive is clearly too far away to reach an ide or a sata connector
[5582.84 --> 5587.88]  oh yeah awesome there's a little bit more of an updated shot so he's actually using a drive cage now
[5587.88 --> 5592.84]  yeah all right upgrades and look at the it came from a fractal case obviously because there are the
[5592.84 --> 5600.20]  accessories yep and real coolers and more secured cooling setup there so he's he's busting out all the
[5600.20 --> 5606.28]  folding 24 cpu cores man that's sexy that's pretty freaking beast we're a long way away from games being
[5606.28 --> 5609.64]  able to leverage something like this but the folding team has been doing really well and in
[5609.64 --> 5613.88]  large part thanks to the way that folding does leverage more course so that one is science that
[5613.88 --> 5617.24]  one was kind of in big support of our folding team and just to show off some of the interesting
[5617.24 --> 5620.44]  things that you can do with computers that a lot of people don't actually realize you can now this
[5620.44 --> 5628.60]  one check out the case old russian oscilloscope this is pretty cool that is the finished computer wow
[5628.60 --> 5633.80]  it's done it's in there it works um this isn't if you read the other specs there this is not the
[5633.80 --> 5638.28]  highest end computer not at all i just i included that because i knew you'd care because it shows
[5638.28 --> 5644.76]  the finish yeah it's black wrinkle finish it's gorgeous yeah so that's yeah so it's not it's not
[5644.76 --> 5650.20]  the highest end computer but it's freaking cool and if you go check out all his build log you can
[5650.20 --> 5654.36]  actually see he takes the whole thing apart like he has to take out the old crt screen which looks
[5654.36 --> 5659.64]  ridiculous you gotta be careful doing that you don't want them to like explode yep and it's a really
[5659.64 --> 5664.76]  interesting bill dog also not to a fan not to a fan very nice uh so yeah check it out because his
[5664.76 --> 5669.48]  build log is really interesting he tears that thing apart and makes just a wonderful little machine
[5669.48 --> 5675.32]  which is as yeah as you can see oh that's the 24 whatever yeah we're done um not super high spec
[5675.32 --> 5681.16]  but super freaking awesome and yeah okay pretty cool well i think that's it for the wan show for this
[5681.16 --> 5685.40]  week unless you had anything else to add i think we actually had a very efficient show today went pretty
[5685.40 --> 5689.72]  quick and covered everything an hour and a half we ended like right on our mark and you guys are
[5689.72 --> 5695.56]  awesome for watching 4500 of you are watching by the end of the show here we are as always overwhelmed
[5695.56 --> 5701.80]  by your support uh tune in next week same bat time same bat channel and if you tuned in late or if you
[5701.80 --> 5706.68]  know anyone who wants to watch or whatever else don't forget the archive always goes up on youtube once
[5706.68 --> 5710.68]  we're done with the live show um you know it helps a lot when we don't have interruptions i think that
[5710.68 --> 5715.00]  was the biggest thing yeah we didn't have any we didn't have any glitchiness today so again thank
[5715.00 --> 5720.20]  you for watching until next time and a big thanks to our sponsor hotspot shield yes one quick thing to
[5720.20 --> 5725.64]  add after party guys i'm gonna be a little bit late because i'm gonna finish that battlefield 4 video
[5725.64 --> 5731.40]  first uh battlefield 4 video first uh and then we will have an after party that's tomorrow morning
[5732.04 --> 5736.52]  that's why they have to party you want to date in the morning yeah she's flying to china for two weeks
[5736.52 --> 5744.84]  so i've seen her before she leaves oh okay anyways that was slightly awkward now it's over why are we
[5744.84 --> 5758.04]  doing that you can't i can't click it
