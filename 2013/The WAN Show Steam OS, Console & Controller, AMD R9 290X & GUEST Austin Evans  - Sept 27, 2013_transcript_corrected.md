[0.00 → 8.90] ...show, covering everything that's hot and new and interesting, whether it's on the gaming side, technology side, or just introducing the show, which I realize we never do.
[9.66 → 10.78] We did last week.
[10.88 → 11.78] Did you? Oh, okay.
[11.78 → 14.10] Oh, wait, introducing the show isn't like, this is the WAN show?
[14.14 → 22.50] Yeah, like, what exactly are you watching right now, and why would you possibly care about it? It's sort of an important thing, but yeah, there you go.
[22.50 → 30.12] So, guys, we have a ton of, like, just completely, ridiculously crazy topics this week.
[30.72 → 32.44] Extremely excited about them.
[32.62 → 39.54] We have our special guest, Austin Evans, a.k.a. Duncan33303 on YouTube.
[40.04 → 50.14] If you've never heard of him before, then go check him out, because he's a sexy beast, and he's going to be joining us in about 25 minutes on the show to talk, we hope.
[50.14 → 56.66] Okay, he just fried the outlet that powers his computer, so I guess he's probably looking for an extension cord right now.
[56.72 → 63.46] But, and I'll be quoted on this, no self-respecting geek should ever be without a reasonably nearby extension cord.
[63.62 → 65.56] So, Austin, you better have one.
[66.18 → 67.64] So, we're going to have him on as a guest.
[67.74 → 70.98] He was with me in Hawaii, so yeah, he says, all should be good now.
[71.32 → 73.38] Had to switch to extension cables.
[73.84 → 75.32] Yeah, yeah, there you go, man.
[75.32 → 85.14] So, he was with me in Hawaii and saw all the demonstrations and presentations, the live one, which everyone saw, and the NDA one, which we cannot talk about.
[85.26 → 89.62] AMD won't even tell us what the NDA date is for the NDA.
[89.76 → 90.94] It's, like, just to be determined.
[91.22 → 92.66] So, we're going to talk about that.
[92.80 → 95.04] We're also going to talk about the Steam triple threat announcements.
[95.24 → 95.54] Go.
[95.74 → 96.00] Boom.
[96.00 → 101.84] Okay, so the first one was SteamOS, which was, in my opinion, the biggest one, because the next one people kind of already knew.
[101.96 → 105.76] But SteamOS is a Linux platform that Steam is kind of editing to themselves.
[105.90 → 107.36] We'll go into that in more depth later.
[107.70 → 112.28] And then Steam Machines, which are the Steam box that people were talking about forever.
[112.44 → 113.52] There's more information about that.
[113.76 → 116.90] And then a Steam controller that doesn't have thumb sticks.
[117.16 → 118.10] It has touchpad.
[119.44 → 121.12] A small, small head explosion.
[121.12 → 126.22] I mean, my head's exploding, but not necessarily for the reasons that the other two made my head explode.
[126.46 → 128.78] Other things that did make my head explode, though.
[129.12 → 132.38] NVIDIA has come out and said, look, we're going to give better support to Linux.
[132.76 → 134.96] And that is obviously a huge deal.
[135.06 → 136.66] And who knows, maybe slightly related to that.
[136.74 → 137.20] More on that.
[137.40 → 138.66] We're teasing the topics.
[139.20 → 140.74] You know, we can't tell you everything right now.
[141.04 → 147.46] And the Chaos Computer Club has broken the fingerprint scanner on the iPhone 5S already.
[147.46 → 150.84] But I'm going to play devil's advocate a little bit when we're discussing this.
[150.92 → 153.44] Because I don't necessarily think that's that big of a deal.
[153.70 → 157.94] So without further ado, here's the intro and a short word from our sponsors.

[220.60 → 225.90] And without further ado, let's just jump right into our first topic, which isn't one that we teased.
[226.78 → 227.82] Surface Pro 2.
[228.24 → 228.98] It's a thing.
[228.98 → 234.02] It's a thing, and it's more of an interesting thing than I think the original one was.
[234.46 → 237.04] Because they fixed a lot of this kind of glaring problems.
[237.18 → 238.56] The battery life is way better.
[239.56 → 243.78] Colour accuracy is better on the screen, which is interesting, but it already had a pretty good screen.
[244.46 → 245.36] Yeah, it was okay.
[245.36 → 254.50] I mean, the thing to me that's actually more interesting here is not only Surface 2 is coming and has a more colour accurate screen,
[255.00 → 256.42] or rather, Surface Pro 2.
[256.42 → 265.70] Surface 2, which I guess they would call Surface RT 2, if Surface RT didn't have such a terrible, terrible reputation,
[266.20 → 269.68] is also coming and is also getting a 1080p screen upgrade.
[269.84 → 270.08] Okay.
[270.08 → 279.90] So now both Surface Pro 2 and Surface 2, the RT version, which makes the naming very confusing, are going to have 1080p screens.
[280.26 → 282.18] There's a variety of other improvements.
[282.36 → 289.58] So guys, the original article here is from Engadget, but I think the biggest ones are going to be, well, Haswell.
[290.12 → 293.18] Haswell is huge for Surface Pro 2.
[293.18 → 305.54] I mean, we're looking at, I think they're quoting, double digits better performance, so 20 to 30% better performance, something along those lines, and a 75% better battery.
[305.78 → 313.12] Even when Surface Pro first launched, we both talked about we're interested in this one because it's an interesting product, but we're interested in when it comes out with Haswell.
[313.72 → 314.02] Yes.
[314.02 → 318.40] We said that, like, way back, so now that's here, and that's actually really cool.
[318.72 → 323.74] And, I mean, this is part of the, well, what this does is I guess it validates.
[324.12 → 330.64] It validates Intel's approach with Haswell, where they came out, and they said, look, it's, well, they didn't come out and say it, but it was pretty obvious.
[330.64 → 335.06] This is not an enthusiast desktop gaming CPU.
[335.22 → 336.36] That's not what this is for.
[336.76 → 344.80] What this is for is it's for energy efficiency, particularly making it more scalable down to much smaller form factors.
[345.02 → 348.88] So Microsoft has made some other improvements to the device as well.
[349.02 → 354.80] So, for example, there's a new power cover that actually improves battery life by two and a half times.
[354.80 → 362.32] So if we do some quick math here, original Surface was good for sort of three and a half to four and a half hours of battery, which is not enough for a tablet.
[362.80 → 365.98] So 75% better puts us around six and a half hours' battery.
[366.24 → 371.98] And then the two and a half times would put us around 15 to 18 hours of battery, like 15, 16 hours of battery.
[372.72 → 373.36] Now we're talking.
[373.54 → 374.82] Yeah, that gets a lot better.
[374.92 → 375.74] Now we're talking.
[375.84 → 383.32] This is a productivity device because, to me, that was the appeal of Surface RT, for that matter, and Surface,
[383.32 → 393.28] was that now all of a sudden it's a mobile device that is genuinely portable and tablet-y, but also genuinely productive.
[394.56 → 396.34] And, I mean, here's the thing, though.
[397.32 → 401.24] Actually, this isn't really on our topics, but I want to discuss this.
[401.76 → 405.30] So, okay, Surface Pro 2.
[406.16 → 408.12] Okay, it's got better battery life.
[408.22 → 409.96] It's got an okay screen.
[409.96 → 417.54] The new type cover, which is the cover that sits on it that actually has a tactile keyboard, so not the touch cover, which was just touch sensitive.
[417.98 → 419.22] It's backlit now.
[419.32 → 420.14] And it's slightly thinner.
[420.36 → 421.38] And it's slightly thinner.
[421.70 → 422.66] So there's all these things.
[422.86 → 428.90] But realistically, if you wanted something that was in between a tablet and a laptop, nowadays, do you just pick up a convertible?
[429.66 → 432.50] So something like this, where you flip the screen around, boom.
[432.50 → 436.44] If you really wanted a Windows 8 tablet, now you have one.
[436.88 → 438.98] And, like, there are situations where a tablet would be better.
[439.34 → 440.98] If you want to be able to walk around and hold it.
[440.98 → 442.90] I've used this, like, four times now.
[442.96 → 448.34] Since the last time I talked about this, when I created a video before I left, I think I said three times, and I used it like this once on my trip.
[448.42 → 455.64] I was, like, watching Netflix videos, and I put it up like this, because that was slightly more convenient in that scenario.
[455.64 → 456.98] Yeah, personally, I don't really care.
[457.08 → 461.32] But I have seen, like, I used to work in, like, a warehouse-y type thing.
[461.84 → 466.16] And one of the guys bought one of those old HP spin around.
[466.34 → 468.10] They can't see your hands when you put them down there.
[468.20 → 468.60] There we go.
[468.80 → 471.94] Old HP laptops where you could take the screen and spin it around like this.
[471.94 → 473.40] With that terrible little hinge in the middle.
[473.40 → 474.36] The single hinge in the middle, yeah.
[474.52 → 477.66] He'd have one of those that he could walk down and write notes down.
[477.80 → 478.06] Okay.
[478.24 → 479.10] Because that was better for him.
[479.10 → 481.78] So maybe it's not the best use case for you or me.
[481.88 → 482.46] I wouldn't care.
[482.46 → 485.70] But it might be a better use case for some people out there.
[485.74 → 491.88] And the Pro 2 still has the stylus, whereas the Surface 2 does not come with a stylus.
[492.30 → 493.46] I mean, the pricing is...
[494.06 → 494.56] Okay, hold on.
[494.62 → 496.32] Let's finish talking about it a little bit more.
[496.78 → 498.96] So they've improved the kickstand.
[499.36 → 501.64] So the kickstand, I actually liked the kickstand.
[501.84 → 506.78] Because their whole thing with kickstand was that they wanted it to feel like a car door, was what they compared it to.
[506.88 → 508.20] You know, shook, shook.
[508.84 → 510.24] Now it has two settings.
[510.24 → 513.24] So instead of being stuck at, like, the one angle.
[513.58 → 514.94] UND only one angle.
[515.86 → 518.50] Now you can actually adjust it to a couple different angles.
[518.58 → 523.10] I mean, this is a problem that not only plagued Surface Pro, but also other convertibles.
[523.56 → 529.48] Like, I've actually grown to really like Dell's implementation of their convertible tablet notebook thing.
[529.92 → 531.54] Convertible Ultrabook, I guess that's what it's called.
[531.60 → 533.28] Sorry, sorry for anyone at Intel who's watching.
[533.80 → 534.54] It's not a tablet.
[534.68 → 535.40] It's not a notebook.
[535.74 → 536.50] It's an Ultrabook.
[536.50 → 541.00] So convertible Ultrabook, I mean, but we have a Sony VAIN Duo 13.
[541.34 → 542.28] Did you check that thing out?
[542.42 → 542.60] No.
[543.46 → 544.96] It's only one angle.
[545.66 → 548.68] The electronics are actually exposed when the hinge is open.
[549.14 → 549.46] Okay.
[549.46 → 554.88] It doesn't close so that the glass of the screen can go down on top of the keyboard, and it can be protected on both sides.
[555.12 → 558.24] The screen stays up even when you close it.
[558.62 → 562.02] So it's just a tablet or just a tablet that's propped up.
[562.08 → 563.50] Like, to me, that's not really convertible.
[563.50 → 566.30] Yeah, I like that style more, I think.
[566.42 → 567.36] This feels better to me.
[567.38 → 569.42] Or something like Lenovo Yoga where it has the 360 degree hinge.
[569.42 → 570.92] I like the yoga a lot.
[571.06 → 572.26] 360 degree hinge.
[573.20 → 580.04] So, I mean, that's sort of my take is do you want to go Surface 2 where you get the thinner form factor?
[580.10 → 580.80] Because it really is.
[580.84 → 581.00] Yeah.
[581.00 → 584.26] You're getting great battery life out of it if you go with something like a battery cover.
[585.12 → 588.26] Or do you want the slightly bulkier but potentially more versatile?
[588.42 → 591.06] I mean, this is going to have a better keyboard than even the type cover.
[592.06 → 594.18] It comes down to what you want to choose.
[594.34 → 604.84] And I mean, I think if you put Surface Pro in the context of pricing it compared to a convertible Ultrabook, it starts to get more appealing.
[604.84 → 608.02] Yeah, if you compare it to other tablets, not so much.
[608.02 → 616.50] So, at $899 for a 64 gig, 4 gig RAM version, and it scales up to, I think, 5, 12, and 8 gig, if I recall correctly.
[616.56 → 617.48] Don't quote me on that, though.
[617.82 → 619.22] So, that starts at $900.
[619.62 → 623.04] That is an extremely expensive 64 gig tablet.
[623.04 → 630.80] But it comes with a 1.6 gigahertz Core i5 Haswell processor in it, which makes it dramatically more powerful than your other tablet.
[631.10 → 631.14] Yeah.
[631.78 → 639.46] But then, I mean, if you look at something like this or something like an Aspire S7 or a Super Slim notebook, you're paying over $1,000 for sure.
[639.58 → 641.90] But then it probably doesn't come in such a low-spec config.
[642.16 → 643.84] So, it comes down to your needs.
[643.98 → 650.52] But Surface Pro 2 is, to me, a really important step because Surface Pro made no sense due to its low battery life.
[650.52 → 655.96] Surface Pro 2, now we could actually go, okay, yeah, there's a scenario for this.
[656.22 → 656.34] Yeah.
[656.48 → 659.90] There's a person that this product fits with.
[660.44 → 664.44] So, that makes me feel a lot better about the direction Microsoft's heading in terms of product.
[664.56 → 674.20] I mean, the funny thing is, is Apple's the only one that ever really does it where they launch a product, MacBook Air, iPad, iPhone.
[674.40 → 676.82] They launch a product that's actually ready for prime time.
[676.82 → 686.66] Everyone else seems to be content to kind of go, let's create like a V0.5, you know, Samsung Galaxy S.
[686.90 → 687.12] Yeah.
[687.26 → 688.22] The first one sucked.
[688.36 → 688.54] Yeah.
[688.94 → 693.56] And like this, when it came out, we knew that the good one was going to be Haswell.
[693.66 → 699.54] We knew Haswell was coming in like eight months or nine months or however many, like it was months, not years.
[699.54 → 699.76] Yeah.
[699.76 → 699.80] Yeah.
[699.80 → 702.22] So, we knew Haswell was going to be more power efficient.
[702.34 → 704.38] We knew that this product was a stopgap.
[704.52 → 711.04] Like, let's get something out there, even though Microsoft must have known that it didn't make the most sense in the world.
[711.42 → 714.92] So, it's like, but we let everyone else get away with this.
[715.16 → 719.58] Whether it's, I mean, the original Asus Zen Book was terrible.
[719.74 → 721.20] The touchpad was broken on it.
[721.34 → 721.58] Yeah.
[721.58 → 723.90] And, but we let them get away with it.
[723.96 → 726.42] So, let's give Microsoft sort of the benefit of the doubt here.
[726.50 → 727.76] Let's let them get away with this one.
[728.24 → 730.26] Surface 2 is interesting as well.
[730.38 → 732.06] So, it gets the 1080p screen upgrade.
[732.36 → 735.48] It's only $450, which is really tablet priced.
[736.34 → 739.00] And it comes with a Terra 4 processor.
[739.82 → 742.70] So, based on my experience with Terra 4 so far.
[743.46 → 743.90] Beast.
[744.24 → 744.42] Yeah.
[744.62 → 745.10] Loving it.
[745.10 → 748.28] Oh, I forgot to mention, Surface Pro 2 supports a 4K output.
[748.72 → 749.64] Yeah, 4K, but.
[749.64 → 751.44] But at 30 hertz or 24 hertz or whatever.
[751.44 → 751.62] Yeah.
[752.32 → 760.12] So, Surface 2 is interesting if you're willing to deal with the whole, you know, Surface RT or Windows RT thing.
[760.76 → 773.86] To me, the most offensive thing about, like, Metro apps or modern UI apps is that it just feels like not a lot of thought was put into some of them.
[773.86 → 784.22] Like, for example, the default photo viewer on Windows 8 is just one of the worst experiences you could possibly have.
[784.22 → 784.58] So, here.
[784.82 → 786.94] I'm going to open something.
[787.38 → 788.42] Sort of open with.
[789.38 → 792.16] And I could share my screen with you, but I'm not going to.
[792.22 → 793.62] So, I'm opening with the Photos app.
[793.62 → 794.62] And I just want to show you guys.
[794.62 → 801.84] Like, I still can't figure out, like, how to get to all the other pictures that are in this folder.
[802.22 → 804.00] Like, they're just not here.
[804.50 → 806.30] And, like, how do I control it?
[806.38 → 809.44] Like, I can, okay, so I can rotate, delete, crop, and set as.
[809.88 → 811.20] And, like, do a slideshow.
[811.30 → 816.32] Well, you know, like, it's just not, like, how do I control it with the mouse?
[816.50 → 819.94] Can I, you know, there's, like, little tiny buttons over here.
[819.94 → 824.32] Like, it just feels like, okay, this was meant to be used one way.
[824.86 → 825.46] And that is.
[825.76 → 826.74] As, like, a picture frame.
[827.18 → 827.44] Yeah.
[827.88 → 829.02] As, like, a photo frame.
[829.14 → 829.66] And, like, okay.
[829.82 → 830.16] Oh, yeah.
[830.18 → 834.50] And when you get here, it's like, okay, well, like, now, now what?
[834.60 → 835.18] Now can I.
[835.26 → 836.54] So, I have to swipe it over here.
[836.62 → 838.80] I have to use their, like, their multitasking UI here.
[839.28 → 843.30] Using this screen with a mouse and keyboard is, like, is edentulous.
[843.46 → 844.60] It just, it's not.
[845.44 → 848.18] I mean, it comes down to my complaints about Windows 8 in general.
[848.18 → 852.40] And I really don't feel like 8.1 has really addressed any of them.
[852.64 → 854.30] It fixed a few things, but, like.
[854.58 → 855.02] Yeah.
[855.64 → 856.98] But I'm still not that happy.
[857.22 → 858.10] That's why it's .1.
[858.28 → 859.66] It didn't really go that far.
[859.92 → 860.26] All right.
[860.32 → 862.76] So, speaking of things that didn't go that far.
[864.22 → 874.58] Apple's efforts to make their new phone have, you know, the most advanced touch identification technology ever, ever, ever.
[874.58 → 878.70] So, this is from the Chaos Computer Club, ccc.de.
[879.42 → 888.40] The biometrics hacking team has broken their, has broken their security in two days.
[888.40 → 896.28] And, like, a large part of that, from what I could glean from the article, a large part of that was, like, they probably didn't get it on the exact first day.
[898.14 → 900.34] And, like, they probably didn't work that hard.
[900.60 → 901.46] Like, it, yeah.
[901.92 → 903.52] It was not hard for them to do.
[903.62 → 905.00] So, you know what?
[905.02 → 905.76] I just realized.
[906.14 → 907.74] I never changed the Twitch thing.
[908.18 → 909.26] When, show, now.
[909.74 → 911.42] Tech and news.
[911.42 → 914.32] I should just, like, update that on the, uh, on the whole Twitch thing.
[914.70 → 917.82] Um, so, I want to play for you guys just a little bit.
[917.88 → 919.02] We're not going to watch the whole thing again.
[919.08 → 923.60] But, we watched this video back when I, um, oh, no.
[923.62 → 924.26] This is a different video.
[924.26 → 925.50] No, this is them breaking it.
[925.50 → 925.68] Okay.
[925.72 → 926.50] This is their video.
[926.88 → 928.72] So, I'm just going to turn the sound off.
[928.88 → 930.22] It's only about a minute-long.
[930.34 → 933.18] But, but, basically, it's similar to the MythBusters.
[933.76 → 935.96] Well, he doesn't show, like, the creation and everything.
[936.10 → 936.20] Yeah.
[936.20 → 940.24] But, what he shows here is he's putting in his fingerprint with his, uh, pointer finger.
[940.64 → 944.74] And then what he does is he puts the printed fingerprint onto his middle finger.
[944.88 → 946.18] And then logs in with his middle finger.
[946.52 → 946.72] Right.
[946.74 → 947.46] That should not work.
[947.56 → 949.80] You have unique fingerprints on each one of your fingers.
[950.16 → 950.38] Right.
[950.48 → 956.50] So, basically, what, um, so, so what they did in the MythBusters episode was they just created,
[956.50 → 960.50] um, like, fake, fake finger skins that worked.
[960.50 → 961.48] Yeah, and that's what they did here.
[961.48 → 965.52] And then, and then they even went as far as to just use, like, a piece of plastic.
[965.96 → 968.16] And then just lick it and put that on there.
[968.38 → 972.00] Um, and, well, I think they just printed one out and then cut the piece of paper and
[972.00 → 972.14] Yeah.
[972.22 → 973.18] the piece of paper and put it on.
[973.18 → 973.78] They did that one.
[974.10 → 978.44] So, so, basically, what, what we, what we've determined here and what, what the Chaos Computer
[978.44 → 984.08] Club is saying is, like, have they done anything here in terms of, you know, subdermal scanning
[984.08 → 985.76] and all the stuff that they're talking about?
[986.10 → 989.00] It looks like it's just a higher resolution fingerprint scanner.
[989.22 → 989.44] Yeah.
[989.68 → 990.94] Which isn't a bad thing.
[991.68 → 994.54] No, but it's not as cool as they tried to make it sound.
[994.66 → 995.90] I mean, it's one of those, okay, here.
[996.46 → 998.76] I'm going to play devil's advocate, and I'm going to say it doesn't matter.
[999.22 → 999.44] What?
[999.94 → 1001.50] Because it's, because it's totally irrelevant.
[1002.30 → 1005.56] Unless you, okay, it's irrelevant to you, and it's irrelevant to me.
[1006.08 → 1009.68] It might not be irrelevant to the President of the United States of America.
[1009.82 → 1010.00] Yeah.
[1010.10 → 1010.62] For example.
[1010.82 → 1010.98] Yeah.
[1011.06 → 1012.58] Someone where, yes.
[1012.76 → 1015.98] That's, that's why I've actually put in here, um, are, are we getting one?
[1016.04 → 1018.30] It would be cool to see, because I would, I would like to actually have a video.
[1018.46 → 1019.24] Uh, yeah, I'll buy one.
[1019.44 → 1019.76] Okay.
[1019.90 → 1020.48] Yeah, I'm going to buy one.
[1020.48 → 1025.30] I want to try and have it where I have to try and steal your fingerprint somehow and then create one and log into your phone.
[1025.34 → 1025.50] Sure.
[1025.74 → 1028.14] Because I would like to see how easy it is.
[1028.22 → 1029.16] Our new camera is here.
[1029.88 → 1034.32] So, uh, Diesel's going to drop it off on, with me on Saturday so I can play around with it a little bit.
[1034.32 → 1038.90] So what I'm thinking is maybe I just, either with your phone or with your, or with that camera.
[1038.90 → 1039.60] Either way, yeah.
[1039.60 → 1041.56] You should try to blog the process.
[1041.86 → 1048.12] And now that I'm aware of it, just like on the MythBusters thing, I will, I'll try not to leave clean fingerprints all over the place.
[1048.20 → 1052.10] Because if you're someone that's that worried, you should be actively trying not to leave clean fingerprints all over the place.
[1052.10 → 1052.54] Exactly.
[1052.78 → 1056.42] So let's find out if he can, if he can actually legit break it.
[1056.56 → 1058.30] And, uh, that'll be a really fun experiment.
[1058.88 → 1063.90] But, um, I mean, I, I definitely hear where you're coming from.
[1063.90 → 1074.16] The Chaos Computer Club is basically saying that fingerprint biometrics and a few other different types of biometrics are just not as secure as they are put out to be.
[1074.52 → 1078.54] So people are assuming no one's going to be able to get this unless they have my finger.
[1078.84 → 1079.92] And that's not true.
[1080.06 → 1081.22] That's what they're trying to say.
[1081.34 → 1083.12] And they're, and that is a perfect message.
[1083.12 → 1091.12] Because while I still don't think it matters, because if you're worried about your little brother breaking into your phone and texting your friends, you know,
[1091.12 → 1096.46] the pictures of you that you hide somewhere else, but he figured out where they are because he's the creepiest little brother ever.
[1096.54 → 1097.16] That's disgusting.
[1097.70 → 1100.94] Um, so if you're worried about something like that, I think it's enough.
[1101.10 → 1101.50] Yeah.
[1101.66 → 1106.88] Whereas if you're worried about, you know, critical company data, you work for a multi-million dollar company,
[1107.20 → 1110.60] a pass phrase is still the way to go.
[1110.94 → 1111.16] Yeah.
[1111.64 → 1115.64] So that is like a nice long string of, it doesn't have to be random characters.
[1115.64 → 1121.18] It can be, you know, um, I really love my son and wife, you know, heart.
[1122.00 → 1123.60] That is a very strong password.
[1123.76 → 1123.92] It is.
[1124.42 → 1125.78] So there you go, guys.
[1126.78 → 1129.72] Um, our guest is going to be joining us in about five minutes.
[1129.86 → 1131.42] Why don't we do a quick Twitter blitz, guys?
[1131.54 → 1136.80] Hit us up with any questions, whether it's about my trip to Hawaii, whether it's about, um, you know,
[1136.86 → 1141.02] I know there were a lot of questions about Slick's, uh, co-host last week.
[1141.02 → 1146.18] So if you have any clarifying questions, yes, he is the firefighter from the IO safe video.
[1146.36 → 1147.44] So I will say that much.
[1147.52 → 1149.10] And no, that was not a costume.
[1149.48 → 1150.80] He is a legit firefighter.
[1150.94 → 1153.88] You saw in the video, he was like in the fire.
[1154.00 → 1154.16] Yeah.
[1154.34 → 1156.04] They don't let just anyone do that.
[1156.10 → 1157.66] We were being very closely supervised.
[1157.68 → 1162.00] He was grabbing pallets that were on fire and putting them on top of the NAS for us.
[1162.24 → 1162.64] Yeah.
[1162.72 → 1165.46] So let's just, let's go ahead and, uh, hit that.
[1165.54 → 1165.78] Wow.
[1165.88 → 1166.80] 52 interactions.
[1166.96 → 1167.30] All right.
[1168.02 → 1168.90] Um, sup.
[1169.44 → 1170.36] NFF12 or NFP.
[1170.36 → 1170.72] You know what?
[1170.74 → 1173.18] I'm behind the mic today, so I'm going to get you to answer these.
[1173.28 → 1173.44] So.
[1174.64 → 1176.80] Uh, I would go NF, wait, what?
[1177.04 → 1179.94] Would 140 millimetre be better for a cooler rig?
[1180.06 → 1180.28] Yeah.
[1180.78 → 1182.68] 140 millimetre would be better.
[1182.92 → 1186.98] Um, but then you're dealing with 120 millimetre fans in the question, but I would say NFF12s.
[1187.22 → 1187.42] Yeah.
[1187.48 → 1189.00] NFF12s are just kind of the boss.
[1189.08 → 1189.20] Yeah.
[1189.24 → 1190.58] NFF12s are pretty sweet.
[1190.76 → 1193.96] Uh, we ordered an XA20 from Canon, something that I can use.
[1194.02 → 1195.62] But that is not the one we're currently on.
[1195.62 → 1197.22] We just aren't very good at setting it up.
[1197.32 → 1197.82] That's why it looks different.
[1197.82 → 1197.92] Yeah.
[1197.98 → 1199.32] We're on the FS700 right now.
[1199.32 → 1202.54] Uh, news on the cat, um, unfortunately no.
[1202.70 → 1207.34] I set up some food and water, um, and a little bed for him in my garage when I went away.
[1207.50 → 1212.74] And I left the door open, but like with tires barricading it because we were leaving our,
[1212.74 → 1216.94] our back door open and a coyote came into our house and like ate all the cat's food and
[1216.94 → 1218.04] all our cereal and stuff.
[1218.22 → 1224.16] So, um, so anyway, so I, so I left that for him, and then I left my, my iPhone set up with
[1224.16 → 1230.00] a time-lapse, um, like taking a picture every minute of the food and, um, uh, Rocket didn't
[1230.00 → 1230.84] come back for it.
[1230.84 → 1231.88] No one came back for it.
[1231.88 → 1233.38] So I think he's, uh, I think he's gone.
[1234.18 → 1239.26] Although at the same time, like while it totally sucks for the people that are freaking out,
[1239.26 → 1243.14] um, Rocket's kind of the biggest badass of a cat I've ever met in my life.
[1243.14 → 1243.60] So.
[1243.60 → 1246.10] So he's probably doing okay for himself.
[1246.10 → 1247.08] He might be out there.
[1247.22 → 1248.14] He might be okay.
[1248.48 → 1249.74] He's, uh, super careful.
[1249.92 → 1251.26] He's, he's super cautious.
[1251.72 → 1253.78] Um, and, uh.
[1253.78 → 1254.20] I hope he's okay.
[1254.40 → 1254.62] Yeah.
[1254.62 → 1255.86] I really hope he's okay.
[1255.98 → 1257.40] I hope someone's stolen.
[1257.86 → 1258.72] That's what I hoped for.
[1258.86 → 1259.18] For that.
[1259.38 → 1259.98] Yeah, to be honest.
[1260.08 → 1261.98] You know, I hope someone has him and he's safe.
[1262.22 → 1263.52] That's, that's all I really want now.
[1264.30 → 1266.68] Uh, what do you think of GTA 5 having microtransactions?
[1266.84 → 1268.00] I, I think it's necessary.
[1268.48 → 1272.24] I mean, you look at how much was spent on the development, and you can kind of go, oh, well,
[1272.24 → 1276.74] they spent 250 million, and they made back, and they made it back in hours or, or whatever you
[1276.74 → 1277.52] might want to say about it.
[1277.52 → 1283.56] But they have to be profitable enough for when they're not making GTA 5 and when they're
[1283.56 → 1284.74] developing GTA 6.
[1284.90 → 1288.06] And all the lapse time in between when they're not actually developing anything, and they still
[1288.06 → 1289.48] have to pay employees and research and blah, blah, blah.
[1289.48 → 1293.98] Or when they're working on bug fixes or improving the content that's within GTA 5 or
[1293.98 → 1295.50] whatever else they want to work on.
[1295.72 → 1296.74] Maybe, who knows?
[1296.94 → 1299.16] Maybe they want to try something that's not GTA.
[1299.50 → 1299.86] They do.
[1300.04 → 1300.34] They make stuff.
[1300.34 → 1301.06] Like, I know that.
[1301.08 → 1301.22] Yeah.
[1301.22 → 1304.68] But what if they want to try something that's not GTA that they, that they don't have any
[1304.68 → 1306.14] previous revenue to draw upon?
[1306.14 → 1307.80] Companies have to make money.
[1308.02 → 1308.20] Yeah.
[1308.42 → 1309.10] They have to make money.
[1309.32 → 1311.20] You don't have to buy in-game items.
[1311.38 → 1313.90] I didn't know that GTA was going to have microtransactions.
[1314.98 → 1315.18] No.
[1315.80 → 1316.78] Personally, to be completely honest.
[1316.78 → 1317.86] I wouldn't be surprised if they do.
[1318.02 → 1321.44] I don't know what they would, I don't know what they would have that would be microtransactions.
[1321.58 → 1322.34] I'm not surprised.
[1324.38 → 1326.30] Okay, used to be something, something, something.
[1326.48 → 1326.72] Oh, yeah.
[1327.68 → 1328.54] Okay, well.
[1329.74 → 1331.40] Oh, GTA Online does.
[1331.64 → 1333.32] GTA Online has microtransactions.
[1333.40 → 1334.18] That makes a lot more sense.
[1334.18 → 1334.96] That makes so much more sense.
[1334.98 → 1336.02] That makes so much more sense.
[1336.02 → 1339.50] GTA Online, again, well, everything I said before, GTA Online.
[1339.94 → 1340.60] Yeah, same thing.
[1340.72 → 1344.76] And even more so, because when you actually have servers that you're running and maintaining
[1344.76 → 1348.28] and you're continuing to develop new content, which was a promise that they have for GTA
[1348.28 → 1351.06] Online, then what else are you going to do?
[1351.06 → 1353.82] I prefer microtransactions to monthly subscriptions.
[1354.88 → 1355.64] I'll say that.
[1355.64 → 1359.52] Do you prefer the free-to-play microtransactions?
[1359.52 → 1360.52] Not necessarily.
[1360.52 → 1361.52] Not necessarily.
[1361.52 → 1366.00] So you prefer a single upfront cost with microtransactions after that?
[1366.06 → 1368.52] I think that's my preferred choice.
[1369.46 → 1369.60] Yeah.
[1370.16 → 1370.92] I just, yeah.
[1371.28 → 1371.44] Yeah.
[1371.44 → 1374.20] Your guess on the price of R9 290X.
[1374.20 → 1374.66] You know what?
[1374.72 → 1378.10] That's a very fair question because I don't know, so I can talk about it.
[1378.10 → 1381.22] But my guess would be pretty much what you're saying.
[1381.38 → 1384.74] I would be surprised if they come in under $599, though.
[1385.24 → 1390.56] Because based on the rumoured performance, which you can go out and find, because I'm
[1390.56 → 1392.52] not going to talk about that because I've seen performance.
[1392.94 → 1397.80] Based on the rumoured performance and how it'll line up, I think that they could price it
[1397.80 → 1400.24] kind of at whatever they wanted to be based on the current landscape.
[1400.48 → 1404.14] And I suspect someone like NVIDIA is probably kind of sitting there waiting for them to
[1404.14 → 1404.84] show their hand.
[1404.90 → 1408.58] And we're going to see some aggressive price movements over the next little bit.
[1408.64 → 1411.22] And then things are going to settle in until Maxwell launches in Q1.
[1411.48 → 1411.60] Yeah.
[1412.80 → 1415.78] How do I install a program when I do a clean installation of Windows 8?
[1415.92 → 1416.76] I don't care what I have to do.
[1416.78 → 1417.58] I just want it done.
[1417.80 → 1418.04] Huh?
[1418.62 → 1419.46] I'm not sure.
[1419.64 → 1419.90] Sorry.
[1420.14 → 1420.28] Sorry.
[1420.36 → 1420.70] Nine-Night.
[1421.04 → 1421.86] Not sure what the question is.
[1421.94 → 1422.34] But Nine-Night.
[1422.42 → 1423.22] Nine-Night.com.
[1423.30 → 1424.74] N-I-N-I-T-E.
[1424.90 → 1425.16] Yeah.
[1425.16 → 1428.34] Is it worth the money if I can get a 690 for the same money?
[1428.70 → 1429.38] I don't know, man.
[1430.22 → 1431.50] Let's wait until the benchmarks are.
[1431.50 → 1431.52] Yeah.
[1431.52 → 1433.54] Why don't we wait and see what the benchmarks look like?
[1434.10 → 1435.10] Got a sound problem.
[1435.22 → 1438.64] Volume decreases randomly even if I disable the Windows communication thing.
[1438.70 → 1442.02] I think there's a global setting for that that's not just Windows communication.
[1442.42 → 1444.20] You might want to go check into that.
[1444.72 → 1446.12] Apparently I look like Michael Bolton.
[1446.76 → 1447.16] Okay.
[1447.30 → 1447.98] Sorry to hear that.
[1448.40 → 1450.30] Do you want to fire up our call with Austin?
[1450.42 → 1450.56] Sure.
[1450.56 → 1453.90] Because he's going to be joining us hopefully in about one minute here.
[1453.90 → 1455.34] So we're really excited about that.
[1455.98 → 1456.30] All right.
[1456.36 → 1457.66] Nice seeing you guys live.
[1457.76 → 1458.56] Great job on the show.
[1458.72 → 1459.28] Thank you.
[1459.38 → 1460.38] Was watching Text Syndicate.
[1460.62 → 1461.54] Logan's a good guy.
[1461.98 → 1466.46] I have no problem telling people watch Text Syndicate because, yeah, he's a good guy.
[1466.48 → 1469.94] I was sorry he wasn't able to be at the GPU 14 event from AMD.
[1470.32 → 1473.42] I'm not sure if he got an invitation, or maybe they missed him.
[1473.50 → 1474.94] But I mentioned him while I was there.
[1475.08 → 1479.12] So hopefully it was just an oversight, and it doesn't happen again, or he was busy or something.
[1479.76 → 1482.46] Any details on the Mysterious 290?
[1482.46 → 1487.80] I can say that it's mysterious.
[1488.18 → 1494.80] I can say that if there was an R9 290 non-X that it would probably be closely related to a 290X.
[1496.62 → 1498.26] What do you think about the new Steam Controller?
[1498.42 → 1499.26] More on this later.
[1499.40 → 1499.52] Yeah.
[1500.76 → 1502.68] We're ready to go whenever...
[1502.68 → 1503.22] Ready to go?
[1503.42 → 1503.76] All right.
[1503.84 → 1506.66] Why don't we do like a couple more Twitter Blitz questions here.
[1508.68 → 1510.20] GTA, what game are you waiting for?
[1510.26 → 1510.80] Star Citizen.
[1510.80 → 1516.22] If you guys check out my vlogs from the AMD event, I met...
[1516.22 → 1518.76] Okay, I have to talk about this for like a minute or so.
[1518.82 → 1519.16] And you know what?
[1519.18 → 1523.12] We'll probably bring Austin on in the middle of it because he was filming my fangirl moment.
[1523.34 → 1523.70] Yeah, I know.
[1523.86 → 1524.88] So, okay, guys.
[1524.88 → 1530.92] I met Chris Roberts who is the guy behind Star Citizen.
[1530.92 → 1535.50] So, formerly of Wing Commander and Freelancer, which is one of my favourite games ever.
[1535.84 → 1540.74] But unfortunately, didn't get any kind of sequel or anything.
[1540.96 → 1542.42] But I have it from him.
[1543.30 → 1543.74] Him.
[1544.22 → 1545.02] From Chris.
[1545.24 → 1546.44] I get to call him Chris now.
[1547.62 → 1548.34] Anyway, I have it from...
[1548.34 → 1549.12] So not fair.
[1549.12 → 1550.18] I have it from Chris.
[1550.24 → 1553.84] And he's like, yeah, I mean, you could see this as a spiritual successor to Freelancer.
[1553.96 → 1555.72] I'm like, that's all I need to hear, man.
[1556.08 → 1559.96] And that 250 bucks I dropped on my Constellation is totally worth it.
[1559.96 → 1565.74] He pulled out like the biggest surprise for me of the conference.
[1565.86 → 1566.12] Well, okay.
[1566.18 → 1567.66] No, Mantle was probably the biggest thing.
[1567.92 → 1568.08] Okay.
[1568.08 → 1573.12] The second-biggest thing of the entire AMD event, which was the hangar module was updated
[1573.12 → 1574.68] so you could walk up into the turret.
[1575.00 → 1578.20] So I got to hear him on stage talking about the turret.
[1578.36 → 1578.88] And you know what?
[1579.04 → 1586.26] The craziest thing about it, and let's go ahead and let's bring Austin in now, was the craziest
[1586.26 → 1586.80] thing about it.
[1586.88 → 1587.60] Is he live?
[1587.68 → 1588.40] Can I listen to him?
[1588.44 → 1589.16] Austin, are you there?
[1590.20 → 1590.44] Yeah.
[1590.50 → 1590.92] What's up, man?
[1591.14 → 1591.50] Hey.
[1591.64 → 1592.16] How are you doing?
[1593.16 → 1593.76] Pretty good.
[1593.98 → 1594.84] Is my audio okay?
[1595.18 → 1598.00] I had a few technical issues when I was getting set up earlier.
[1598.20 → 1600.72] We turned you up a bit just now, so it should be good.
[1601.04 → 1603.88] But okay, so where was I going with this?
[1603.94 → 1605.02] The turret was amazing.
[1605.78 → 1606.72] And oh, yeah.
[1607.00 → 1610.02] So after the show, I walked up to him.
[1610.20 → 1613.02] And if you haven't watched the vlog already, then you don't know this already.
[1613.56 → 1616.22] And I was like about to introduce myself.
[1616.42 → 1618.38] And he's just like, oh, yeah, I've watched your videos.
[1618.42 → 1626.14] I'm like, that made my month at least.
[1626.14 → 1628.34] So that was super exciting.
[1628.54 → 1630.94] So Austin, welcome to the show.
[1631.22 → 1636.10] Can you take maybe a couple of minutes here and introduce yourself for those members of
[1636.10 → 1639.08] our audience who don't already know who you are?
[1639.68 → 1640.16] Yeah, definitely.
[1640.16 → 1642.58] So my name is Austin.
[1642.88 → 1649.14] I do tech videos kind of like Mr. Linus here, although probably more of the boring kind of
[1649.14 → 1651.90] stuff like phones and tablets and that kind of stuff.
[1651.96 → 1653.22] But I also do PC gaming.
[1653.46 → 1657.98] And obviously, we were both at the AMD event actually just yesterday.
[1658.66 → 1659.32] So, yeah.
[1659.32 → 1660.82] All right.
[1660.88 → 1667.28] So, guys, you can find him at YouTube.com slash Austin Evans or YouTube.com slash Duncan33303.
[1667.50 → 1669.26] The old link does still work.
[1669.72 → 1670.28] You know what?
[1670.40 → 1674.12] I think I don't know if this is in our list of topics that I wanted to discuss with you.
[1674.20 → 1678.20] But I want to kick this off because you and I spent quite a bit of time talking about this
[1678.20 → 1678.84] on the trip.
[1678.84 → 1685.84] Speaking of being able to find you at Duncan33303 or Austin Evans, the amount of integration
[1685.84 → 1690.92] that Google is moving forward with between YouTube and Google Plus.
[1691.48 → 1691.72] Go.
[1692.92 → 1694.40] Oh, you're going to throw this one at me, huh?
[1694.52 → 1694.96] Yeah.
[1695.16 → 1697.40] Because you had some fascinating thoughts on this.
[1697.46 → 1698.10] So let's hear it.
[1698.56 → 1698.74] Yeah.
[1698.82 → 1702.78] So it's kind of interesting because we were obviously out in Hawaii.
[1702.86 → 1704.20] We were actually on a hike.
[1704.20 → 1708.02] So I was trying to find data because I just checked my tweets and like, by the way, YouTube
[1708.02 → 1708.68] comments are gone.
[1708.68 → 1709.52] It's all Google Plus now.
[1709.58 → 1711.30] We were both like, what, what, what, huh?
[1712.54 → 1717.70] So basically the idea here, if you guys haven't seen, is that Google Plus has always kind of
[1717.70 → 1720.76] been, at least for the last couple of years, has always been kind of on a collision course
[1720.76 → 1721.32] with YouTube.
[1721.80 → 1724.22] So Google is always trying to, you know, integrate them more.
[1724.68 → 1728.06] I mean, it started with little things, and now it's kind of getting on to bigger things
[1728.06 → 1732.36] like, for example, how I was able to change my name is I was able to link it with my Google
[1732.36 → 1736.82] Plus, which now instead of seeing Duncan33303 on my channel, it's Austin Evans.
[1736.82 → 1741.94] And now they're just kind of taking that a next step further with the Google Plus comments.
[1742.66 → 1748.60] So I don't think it's a too controversial thing to say that the comments on YouTube have
[1748.60 → 1750.22] never really been all that great.
[1750.22 → 1751.22] Yeah.
[1751.22 → 1756.68] I mean, I think one of the problems I brought up with you particularly was that I really
[1756.68 → 1759.12] hated the way that I would reply to a comment.
[1759.20 → 1761.44] Someone says something like, oh, Linus, you got the spec wrong.
[1761.80 → 1766.66] And I'd say, you know, well, no, actually, depending on whatever, this is how it is.
[1766.66 → 1768.64] And it would get like, you know, 150 thumbs up.
[1768.76 → 1773.04] So it would, it should in theory sit at the top, but because of their decay algorithm and
[1773.04 → 1778.02] because of just YouTube being YouTube, it would often get lost, and it would just fall
[1778.02 → 1778.38] away.
[1778.78 → 1783.14] And so we'd end up with a ton of the same comment about something that the uploader has
[1783.14 → 1783.90] already addressed.
[1784.12 → 1788.16] So maybe, maybe walk through some of the changes that they're making to make the comments not
[1788.16 → 1791.14] only friendlier, but also better for the uploaders themselves.
[1791.14 → 1795.56] Well, I would, but the thing is, I actually haven't been able to test them yet.
[1796.04 → 1799.54] I just, pretty much all I know so far is just what they've kind of announced yet.
[1799.70 → 1801.82] It's not even coming out for another couple months, right?
[1801.96 → 1803.32] Yeah, not until, end of year, I think.
[1803.96 → 1804.36] End of year?
[1804.48 → 1804.62] Yeah.
[1804.74 → 1810.38] So, I mean, the big thing is that they're trying to increase, now, actually, I'm going to sound
[1810.38 → 1810.88] dumb here.
[1811.34 → 1813.16] Do you actually have to use your real name?
[1813.32 → 1814.42] Because I don't actually know that part.
[1814.48 → 1814.66] No.
[1814.74 → 1815.26] You don't have to.
[1815.28 → 1817.56] You can still use an alias, which is great.
[1818.46 → 1818.74] Okay.
[1818.74 → 1820.94] So if you can still use the alias, that's great.
[1820.94 → 1824.84] But I think the big thing that they're kind of focusing on here is trying to get the organization
[1824.84 → 1825.44] a little bit better.
[1825.58 → 1828.00] Like you said, like, I had the same problem.
[1828.14 → 1831.98] I did a iPhone versus Galaxy speed test, which, by the way, was a terrible idea.
[1832.24 → 1835.78] But a bunch of people were, you know, kind of, like, calling me out saying, hey, there's
[1835.78 → 1836.80] different screen resolutions.
[1837.42 → 1840.68] And I had to continuously, like, reply every, like, hour or so.
[1840.76 → 1841.50] Like, no, they're not.
[1841.54 → 1842.42] It was run off-screen.
[1842.46 → 1843.08] It doesn't matter.
[1843.68 → 1845.52] So that's probably one of the biggest things.
[1845.66 → 1848.26] But what do you think about the Google Plus integration?
[1848.26 → 1851.34] Because I know you've been having a lot of issues with Google Plus trying to, you know,
[1851.38 → 1853.74] get it all worked out and connected and all that kind of stuff.
[1853.82 → 1856.22] I find Google Plus extremely difficult to use.
[1856.60 → 1860.82] And part of the reason is that I have multiple YouTube channels, which is something that you
[1860.82 → 1861.68] don't really deal with.
[1861.68 → 1867.96] And I have, of course, not only all the Gmail accounts that go with all those YouTube accounts because of that horrible
[1867.96 → 1872.10] one-to-one relationship that they forced us to maintain for all that time.
[1872.24 → 1879.14] But also just because I have, you know, personal Gmail this and legacy and work Gmail that and just random
[1879.14 → 1880.28] legacy Gmail accounts.
[1880.44 → 1884.50] So for me, the difficulty I had with it is I found it kind of confusing.
[1884.76 → 1887.86] I find the functionality just isn't as simple as things I'm used to.
[1887.86 → 1891.44] I mean, I'm a little bit old school, like what's your ICQ number?
[1891.98 → 1896.20] ASL, you know, that kind of old school junk, right?
[1896.28 → 1901.56] So to me, when I was searching for Austin Evans trying to add you to Google Plus to a circle,
[1901.78 → 1907.24] and every Austin Evans under the sun except you comes up, and then I have to, like, go and, like,
[1907.26 → 1911.60] go into Gmail and then, like, add you by email there and invite you.
[1911.66 → 1913.74] I'm just kind of sitting here going, you've got to, I mean, you've got to be kidding me.
[1913.74 → 1919.16] It's not that elegant yet, and that's frustrating, and I haven't really invested the time into figuring it out
[1919.16 → 1923.44] because I was just kind of playing that waiting game where it's like maybe I can just put this off
[1923.44 → 1928.60] and I won't have to do it, and maybe Google will just fix YouTube at some point.
[1928.66 → 1934.18] But you can see that this has been in the works for a long time based on things like the fact that they're giving us,
[1934.50 → 1937.26] they've never fixed the inbox, which is a terrible piece of garbage.
[1937.26 → 1943.10] They've taken away functionality, like being able to see our full list of subscribers.
[1943.26 → 1944.34] I mean, that was years ago.
[1944.86 → 1949.62] But now we have that new tab within YouTube, which is the actually,
[1949.68 → 1952.56] I'm just going to load this up on my screen and do a quick screen share here
[1952.56 → 1955.14] so people who haven't seen it can see it.
[1955.64 → 1956.88] But there we go.
[1956.96 → 1958.70] We've got a couple of new windows here.
[1958.78 → 1961.76] So there's community where you can see top fans.
[1961.96 → 1964.44] There are a bunch of videos that aren't uploaded yet, which doesn't really matter.
[1964.44 → 1964.80] Don't worry.
[1965.18 → 1966.38] There's creation tools.
[1966.52 → 1970.82] So they're really finally starting to upgrade it as part of this whole integration thing.
[1970.92 → 1973.48] So I guess I better just suck it up or what?
[1973.70 → 1977.90] Some interesting stuff that I noticed too is you were talking about how you didn't like
[1977.90 → 1979.76] that the uploader's comments weren't featured.
[1980.04 → 1980.14] Yeah.
[1980.54 → 1984.72] They're going to be putting prioritization on uploader comments and uploader's friends' comments.
[1984.94 → 1986.68] So I believe you can make a circle of people.
[1986.80 → 1991.68] So if you made a circle for like Landis Media Group, my comments, your comments, Easel's comments,
[1991.78 → 1993.30] Brandon's comments would all be prioritized.
[1993.30 → 1998.02] And then you also have additional moderator tools so you can filter out certain keywords.
[1999.12 → 2000.04] And there are lots of...
[2000.04 → 2000.10] Which is nice.
[2000.22 → 2001.76] Which will be fantastic.
[2002.02 → 2003.54] Automated moderation will be great.
[2004.26 → 2008.08] And then the other thing is the ability to...
[2008.08 → 2008.42] Oh, crap.
[2008.48 → 2009.50] I was going somewhere with this.
[2009.76 → 2010.46] But yeah.
[2010.58 → 2011.10] Oh, yeah.
[2011.18 → 2011.36] Right.
[2011.62 → 2016.74] And finally, the ability to use a single Google Plus account to manage multiple YouTube channels.
[2016.88 → 2020.24] That's great for me because I do manage multiple channels.
[2020.24 → 2026.76] But I think like the funny thing for me is I can't figure out whether to use Google Plus as myself personally
[2026.76 → 2031.82] or to have Linus Tech Tips be kind of the overarching one or have Linus Media Group be the...
[2031.82 → 2035.04] Like I still got to figure out and play around with it how I want to do it.
[2035.04 → 2039.86] And it doesn't help that I have like a few Google Plus accounts that I sort of half-heartedly created.
[2039.86 → 2041.94] And I don't know what any of them are linked to.
[2042.26 → 2043.72] So, yeah.
[2044.72 → 2045.20] I know.
[2045.28 → 2047.96] I can tell you I've got myself set up as a page.
[2048.16 → 2054.78] I feel like pages on Google Plus make sense for us because you do have those extra features like you were saying.
[2054.86 → 2056.96] You can actually create additional YouTube accounts.
[2057.44 → 2059.26] And then they can all be managed by a page.
[2059.48 → 2060.22] I don't...
[2060.22 → 2063.28] Don't quote me on this, but I don't believe you can actually do that with a normal profile.
[2063.40 → 2064.64] It has to be run through a page.
[2064.64 → 2068.10] So, there are advantages to having a page as opposed to a profile.
[2068.66 → 2072.34] And unlike on Facebook, as far as I know, there aren't really any disadvantages.
[2072.58 → 2074.76] Like your content still surfaces the same way.
[2075.04 → 2075.14] Right.
[2075.34 → 2078.08] It's not like the algorithm is kind of like going against you or anything.
[2078.20 → 2083.06] So, as far as I know, the page definitely does make sense on Google Plus.
[2083.12 → 2087.84] But they could change that algorithm at any time, which they've done a billion times in the past.
[2088.06 → 2088.84] And so, yeah.
[2089.32 → 2093.92] So, let's move into our next big topic, which is the AMD Mantle API,
[2093.92 → 2100.04] which they showed off a new graphics card or seven or however many graphics cards they showed off while we were there.
[2100.54 → 2104.94] They talked about, you know, game developer relationships and that kind of stuff.
[2105.86 → 2108.66] But let's talk Mantle API.
[2109.54 → 2109.80] Yes.
[2109.96 → 2111.10] This is a huge deal.
[2112.12 → 2112.36] Yeah.
[2112.56 → 2117.44] It was kind of a big surprise for me because obviously we had heard a little bit about it.
[2117.50 → 2121.56] But when they actually started talking about it, I was like, it kind of really took me aback.
[2121.56 → 2126.96] I think it's a good step forward because as you can talk to pretty much any game developer,
[2127.42 → 2132.56] you know, using DirectX 11 is not – I mean, DirectX is just so –
[2133.56 → 2134.52] It's bloated.
[2135.02 → 2135.38] Bloated.
[2135.50 → 2136.50] That's the perfect word.
[2136.64 → 2137.88] So, yeah.
[2138.44 → 2142.10] It's just not the greatest way to get the maximum amount of hardware.
[2142.10 → 2142.46] Sure.
[2142.54 → 2146.24] I mean, if you want compatibility with, you know, a million graphics cards and everything,
[2146.44 → 2147.36] yeah, it's going to be great.
[2147.66 → 2150.48] But do you want to get the maximum performance out of all those graphics cards?
[2150.84 → 2152.78] Well, it's just not really going to be the correct choice.
[2152.90 → 2155.48] So, Mantle is definitely a step in the right direction, I think.
[2155.98 → 2157.64] So, here's the – I mean, here's the challenge.
[2157.70 → 2160.50] So, I had this – this is directly from Chris Roberts.
[2160.50 → 2168.12] I was – I wanted to discuss Mantle with him because even though most of the Mantle presentation was focused on Battlefield 4,
[2168.58 → 2171.68] you know, there's going to be other games that are going to support it.
[2171.72 → 2173.42] So, I just basically wanted to hit him up.
[2173.44 → 2176.56] I was like, dude, why?
[2176.56 → 2191.28] Why is it that games run so crap on a PC even if it's a PC-optimized game, and it was developed for PC first compared to what they can do on the consoles themselves?
[2191.36 → 2200.60] And he was saying, well, it has to do with the number of calls because when you have, you know, a 500 – what was it?
[2202.12 → 2204.88] I'm not sure what you're – are you talking about the API calls?
[2205.48 → 2206.16] No, no, no, no.
[2206.16 → 2206.72] Okay, you know what?
[2206.86 → 2208.06] I'll be back in a moment.
[2208.40 → 2209.28] So, you know what?
[2210.48 → 2210.80] Go.
[2210.94 → 2211.62] I can talk about – yeah.
[2211.84 → 2216.92] So, one thing that I noticed right away was when they were talking about this, it reminded me of 3DFX's Glide.
[2217.64 → 2218.80] That's kind of a throwback.
[2219.82 → 2223.18] Which was interesting and people were actually happy to see it go away.
[2223.38 → 2226.14] So, I found it kind of surprised that something like this was coming back.
[2226.54 → 2231.64] But I expect that AMD is going to push this really heavily with games that they're helping sponsor.
[2231.82 → 2234.30] So, obviously, they're behind Star Citizen quite a bit.
[2234.30 → 2236.60] So, Star Citizen is probably going to be developing for Mantle.
[2236.92 → 2239.60] And I think it's also going to be interesting when they pull things from console.
[2239.70 → 2249.96] So, if someone's developing for console, and they want to use these really low-level APIs, with Mantle, you'll be able to port over still using that low-level API.
[2249.96 → 2255.24] Which is fascinating because then if you're able to utilize it, that's awesome.
[2255.54 → 2259.18] But then, again, there's the great part and there's the surprising part.
[2259.26 → 2268.08] Part of the surprising part is it's going to be hard to get a lot of developers, mainly on the PC side, to utilize this without some type of sponsorship or backing.
[2268.08 → 2273.60] Because when you're developing for this, you're going to also have to develop for those high-level APIs.
[2273.60 → 2276.42] Because not every card is going to be able to use Mantle.
[2277.30 → 2277.72] Yeah.
[2278.06 → 2282.86] Specifically, non-NVIDIA cards and nonagon cards for that matter.
[2283.70 → 2287.26] Although, on the other side, it does work with all GCN cards.
[2287.34 → 2290.02] So, it's not just the new R7 and R9 series.
[2290.48 → 2292.98] So, that includes, like, you know, 7000 series.
[2293.20 → 2298.16] So, a good chunk of graphics cards will be able to just, you know, they'll flip a switch and Mantle will be able to work.
[2298.24 → 2299.52] So, that is good, I'd say.
[2300.90 → 2302.98] It's just an interesting position that they've taken.
[2303.24 → 2303.48] Okay.
[2303.66 → 2304.04] So, here.
[2304.20 → 2304.64] There we go.
[2304.74 → 2306.82] So, I remember what I was talking about with Chris.
[2306.82 → 2321.20] So, he was saying that depending on the complexity of an object, a computer's GPU is so powerful that it's not necessarily more difficult to render something that's relatively simple or to render something that's ten times as complicated.
[2321.46 → 2323.10] That is not actually what's important.
[2323.24 → 2331.72] What's important is how many draw calls you can actually, that you can actually send to the GPU.
[2331.72 → 2339.86] So, there's a CPU bottleneck that exists because of OpenGL or DirectX or any of those higher level APIs that doesn't exist on the consoles.
[2340.24 → 2348.36] So, even though the consoles don't have the PC's capability of drawing, of rendering these more complex objects so quickly,
[2348.68 → 2353.68] because we can hit them so many times more frequently, well, we can still draw more.
[2353.96 → 2356.42] And we can actually make better use of that hardware.
[2356.42 → 2365.26] And that's aside from being able to make better use of the memory itself and being able to better optimize for the architecture of the GPU itself.
[2365.70 → 2367.92] So, this is the big problem.
[2368.06 → 2375.18] And that was what Chris talked about a lot was how many individual calls you can send to the GPU to get an object rendered.
[2375.18 → 2383.16] Because we're wasting that horsepower on the GPU by just rendering these smaller objects or bigger objects doesn't matter,
[2383.30 → 2388.36] but being limited to how many you can do, how many requests you can hit it with at a time.
[2388.54 → 2391.80] So, that was, to him, the huge thing.
[2391.86 → 2396.86] And I haven't heard any quotes in terms of performance improvements that we're capable of seeing.
[2396.86 → 2405.58] But with optimization, I mean, we could be looking at, well, you look at how well something runs on a console versus how well something runs on a PC.
[2405.88 → 2406.92] And imagine that, guys.
[2407.00 → 2409.04] Imagine if we could actually leverage that additional power.
[2409.74 → 2414.80] And the last thing I want to touch on is I think the timing is perfect for this.
[2415.40 → 2420.44] So, AMD came out and said during the conference that this is by request.
[2420.68 → 2425.30] This isn't something that they're pushing on the game devs, like Phys, for example.
[2425.30 → 2429.30] This is something that the game devs have been coming to them and saying, we want this.
[2429.60 → 2432.68] We want to get closer to the metal when we're programming our games.
[2433.10 → 2437.30] Especially with the position that they're in, making the hardware for both consoles.
[2437.46 → 2438.88] That's why game devs are asking for this.
[2438.90 → 2442.36] So, they can port out from both consoles in the same way, which is just awesome.
[2442.36 → 2444.22] And that's why the timing is excellent.
[2444.40 → 2444.56] Yep.
[2444.68 → 2447.86] Because now you've got two new consoles coming.
[2447.86 → 2453.50] So, the game devs are going to have to be figuring out how to optimize for this GCN architecture anyway.
[2453.50 → 2455.16] So, we've got that happening.
[2455.62 → 2462.50] And because GCN's been out on PC for almost two years now, there's a fairly large installation base there as well,
[2462.60 → 2468.34] which helps to justify the additional expense of, well, adding an API as an option.
[2468.42 → 2474.22] Not only that, but now, okay, maybe now we can move over to other platforms like Linux, Steam box.
[2475.68 → 2476.08] Awesome.
[2476.08 → 2480.44] So, yeah, so there are a couple of things that kind of jumped out at me about Mantle.
[2480.56 → 2485.10] One of them is, is like you were saying earlier, one of the bigger advantages is that it allows, you know,
[2485.16 → 2487.62] games to take better advantage of the hardware.
[2488.06 → 2492.36] And more specifically, it's going to make it easier for games to take advantage of more CPU cores.
[2492.86 → 2497.24] Which, amazingly enough, AMD, they kind of have been shipping a lot of CPU cores lately.
[2497.24 → 2497.68] Yeah.
[2497.74 → 2502.08] So, that's actually, kind of could be a little interesting kind of to come back.
[2502.14 → 2503.82] Because, obviously, the consoles are 8 core.
[2504.36 → 2506.34] The higher end FX stuff is 8 core.
[2506.48 → 2510.76] I'm sure we'll probably be seeing 8 core Apus within, you know, eventually.
[2511.26 → 2512.98] So, that's definitely one thing.
[2513.68 → 2520.02] For Mantle, for me, I think a big thing is that it really is going to kind of try to bridge that gap between consoles and PCs.
[2520.02 → 2524.50] Obviously, we'll have to see, like you said, performance and all that kind of stuff.
[2524.66 → 2530.78] But it wouldn't surprise me if Mantle really isn't actually that difficult to kind of develop for.
[2530.88 → 2536.18] Because if you're already doing it for consoles, perhaps if Mantle is similar to the way consoles work,
[2536.22 → 2541.36] and that kind of seems to be the way things are, it might not actually be that difficult for a developer to say,
[2541.36 → 2544.96] hey, yeah, we're going to go ahead and support Mantle and, you know,
[2544.98 → 2548.54] just magically make everything better and awesome and all that kind of stuff.
[2548.54 → 2551.88] I mean, the big concern I have is we're splitting developer resources.
[2552.12 → 2557.94] So, I think Glide is a great example of why we moved away from that in the past.
[2558.16 → 2561.44] And are we moving towards even more fragmentation?
[2561.66 → 2566.32] I mean, you know, a couple of years from now, do we see NVIDIA introduce their own thing?
[2566.32 → 2570.50] Now, all of a sudden, do game developers have to support OpenGL, Direct3D, Mantle,
[2570.70 → 2573.74] and some kind of theoretical NVIDIA one?
[2574.12 → 2575.32] And do we see...
[2575.84 → 2577.74] And that's where it gets messy.
[2577.74 → 2583.62] But then they have the nice, very solid advantage of having those consoles.
[2583.82 → 2586.54] Is the solution to just abandon Direct3D at that point?
[2587.68 → 2588.08] Ooh.
[2589.14 → 2592.02] That's like the nuclear option.
[2592.14 → 2592.48] I don't know.
[2592.98 → 2596.42] That's the scary one.
[2596.54 → 2600.48] I mean, you know, from an end user's perspective, if it's well implemented,
[2600.84 → 2603.54] Mantle's going to be as simple as, like in Valve games,
[2603.54 → 2607.42] where you can just drop Direct3D, OpenGL, and choose your renderer.
[2608.62 → 2610.72] Mantle's going to be that simple.
[2611.50 → 2615.98] But from a developer perspective, I'll be really interested to see how this works out.
[2615.98 → 2618.74] And if we see weird compatibility glitches,
[2618.74 → 2622.84] and all of a sudden it becomes yet another bloody thing for end users to diagnose,
[2622.84 → 2625.84] so I'm using the wrong renderer for this game.
[2625.84 → 2628.48] And as long as they don't make it the default, it shouldn't be that big of a deal.
[2628.84 → 2631.16] Well, I think they probably will, as far as...
[2631.16 → 2633.70] Because it'll be coming out on some games.
[2633.78 → 2635.50] I would imagine that they're not just going to ship it and say,
[2635.60 → 2639.54] oh, by the way, there's this magical thing that makes your game run a million times faster,
[2639.82 → 2641.38] but we're not actually going to activate it.
[2641.46 → 2643.40] So, yeah, we'll have to see.
[2643.52 → 2643.72] I mean...
[2643.72 → 2648.22] You know what's funny is we're going to have an EA moment on the show
[2648.22 → 2653.92] if Battlefield 4 doesn't automatically run on Mantle once it's available.
[2655.80 → 2656.98] I would imagine it would be.
[2657.18 → 2659.18] I mean, that's kind of a big deal for them.
[2659.44 → 2662.76] So they showed off a slide that actually did say specifically
[2662.76 → 2666.66] that Mantle will allow Battlefield 4 to utilize eight threads,
[2666.86 → 2668.88] which is extremely exciting.
[2669.10 → 2670.46] And also that it's only the beginning.
[2670.46 → 2675.80] I mean, FPS is the tip of the iceberg when it comes to games that EA intends
[2675.80 → 2679.96] for other developers to run using Frostbite.
[2680.18 → 2681.96] So, I mean, by the time...
[2681.96 → 2686.52] It's not even a matter of AMD winning in terms of getting it implemented game by game,
[2686.66 → 2691.22] but if they can win a couple big engines, then this will be a thing.
[2691.34 → 2692.64] And it's extremely exciting.
[2693.36 → 2693.98] Definitely, yeah.
[2694.02 → 2699.30] Because not only does that have implications for making performance better on AMD-based PCs,
[2699.30 → 2701.08] but also, hey, you know what?
[2701.10 → 2704.02] You're going to be building for, you know, Frostbite or whatever particular engine.
[2704.32 → 2705.40] Okay, so I'm going to check a box.
[2705.48 → 2706.42] Oh, it's going to run on consoles.
[2706.52 → 2707.22] It's going to run on PC.
[2707.58 → 2708.80] Obviously, it's not quite that simple.
[2708.90 → 2710.52] But it all kind of...
[2710.52 → 2711.18] It snowballs.
[2711.26 → 2713.94] It kind of helps one thing, helps the other thing, helps the other thing.
[2714.18 → 2717.14] Just kind of improves performance and improves compatibility across the board.
[2717.14 → 2721.00] So, this was mine and your first time at an AMD event.
[2722.56 → 2723.88] What were your thoughts?
[2723.94 → 2724.58] What was your takeaway?
[2725.88 → 2729.76] Well, first, they had Hawaii, which I think was a pretty awesome place.
[2729.84 → 2730.92] I actually had never been before.
[2731.06 → 2734.14] So, it was a really, really nice place that they had it.
[2734.52 → 2737.60] As far as the information, I thought it was fascinating.
[2737.74 → 2741.92] They were very, you know, technical and detailed and kind of explained a lot.
[2741.92 → 2747.58] I think we both had a chance to actually go one-on-one with some people from AMD
[2747.58 → 2750.96] and kind of answer some of our deep questions about, you know, the particulars
[2750.96 → 2753.74] and all that kind of stuff once actually the cards come out.
[2753.82 → 2754.90] But I was really impressed.
[2755.04 → 2756.18] I thought that they had...
[2756.18 → 2757.86] First, it was a well-organized event.
[2758.50 → 2762.32] There was plenty for us to see and do and kind of learn about all the new stuff.
[2762.60 → 2763.80] I like that demo room.
[2764.02 → 2766.58] I think they may have seen it in the vlog.
[2766.78 → 2767.54] Did you show that off?
[2767.94 → 2770.24] All like the 4K monitors and...
[2770.24 → 2771.52] 4K infinity.
[2771.92 → 2775.02] Which was just like...
[2775.02 → 2776.20] What is that?
[2776.30 → 2777.38] Like 12,000?
[2777.58 → 2778.64] Like 12K pixels?
[2778.90 → 2779.42] Yeah.
[2779.66 → 2782.96] That would be effectively 12 times HD.
[2783.74 → 2786.26] Which is mind-blown.
[2786.38 → 2788.88] Running off of two 290Xs.
[2789.44 → 2789.78] And they were...
[2789.78 → 2791.16] I mean, it was Dirt 3.
[2791.60 → 2792.70] But, you know.
[2792.70 → 2795.76] The funny thing was, looking at it, they were playing Dirt on it.
[2795.84 → 2797.48] You could see, like, the textures.
[2797.48 → 2800.74] Like, Dirt was clearly nowhere near made for 4K.
[2800.74 → 2803.08] But because of the screens and because of the resolution,
[2803.52 → 2806.18] which is so, like, astronomically high.
[2806.56 → 2809.48] Like, you could look at the text compared to, like, the actual textures.
[2809.76 → 2811.00] And there was a huge difference.
[2811.00 → 2814.82] Which, obviously, I don't think a lot of developers are really, you know,
[2815.02 → 2816.62] designing for 12K.
[2816.78 → 2817.06] Yeah.
[2817.12 → 2817.84] They're not too worried.
[2817.84 → 2822.02] But it was a really cool thing to see just that many pixels.
[2822.30 → 2822.92] What is it actually?
[2823.04 → 2827.36] That's, what, like, 24, 25 megapixels being rendered on the fly?
[2827.44 → 2827.70] Yeah.
[2827.70 → 2828.80] It's edentulous.
[2830.04 → 2831.48] Just edentulous.
[2831.62 → 2836.58] I mean, when we talk about, you know, a camera being able to process an image like that,
[2836.58 → 2840.76] you know, we're talking like, you know, it processes the image and then, you know,
[2840.80 → 2841.36] give it a sec.
[2841.62 → 2842.32] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2842.32 → 2845.26] So they had a few other demos.
[2845.40 → 2847.10] Let's talk about real sound a little bit.
[2847.20 → 2851.02] Because I know, okay, guys, for all of you tuned in, don't touch that dial.
[2851.10 → 2852.76] We're not going to talk about it for half an hour.
[2853.32 → 2853.72] Okay?
[2854.46 → 2859.08] So real sound, just as a quick briefer, is basically a programmable,
[2859.08 → 2862.34] it's the equivalent to what a programmable shader was on the visual side.
[2862.34 → 2870.12] So its programmable sound built into the GPU so that game devs can look at the resources that they have available to them
[2870.12 → 2874.26] and know that they're going to be able to program in more advanced audio effects.
[2874.38 → 2877.18] Now, they had a demo that they were running in that demo room,
[2877.26 → 2880.92] which is what reminded me of real sound, because otherwise it really wasn't on the top of my mind.
[2881.26 → 2885.44] Because it's only going to be supported on a couple of the upcoming GPUs even.
[2885.44 → 2891.70] So real sound is basically a way of turning sound into more of a physics thing,
[2891.80 → 2899.08] as opposed to running around, you know, the office, you know, banging on things to create sound effects,
[2899.16 → 2905.14] and then just having a library of sounds that it draws upon in a given sort of scenario.
[2905.58 → 2908.14] So like in games where the swords clash, for example,
[2908.56 → 2912.54] it's going to sound like Clash 1, 2, or 3, or Heavy Clash 1 or 2 kinds of thing.
[2912.54 → 2915.02] So Austin, you heard the Thief demo.
[2915.78 → 2920.62] Tell me what you think of this new way of implementing particularly reverberations in the sound.
[2921.26 → 2922.16] Yeah, see, that's exactly it.
[2922.20 → 2928.48] True audio is, yeah, typically in a game, it just plays like a quick MP3 or whatever,
[2928.62 → 2929.56] and it's very simple.
[2930.00 → 2932.72] And there are ways of making the sound kind of seem more realistic,
[2932.86 → 2937.00] like with like reverberations and whatnot when you're in, you know, maybe like a church or whatever.
[2937.32 → 2941.74] Or EAX used to be the thing that was pushing that forward,
[2941.74 → 2943.96] but that just died in a fire when Vista got launched.
[2944.68 → 2944.78] Yeah.
[2945.22 → 2949.10] So, but one of the main drawbacks is that that kind of takes more of CPU,
[2949.60 → 2952.22] more of a hit on the CPU, and then a lot of times like,
[2952.28 → 2954.98] ah, we want to hurt the performance of the game just so it sounds a little bit better.
[2955.10 → 2958.00] But this seems to be a little bit more of a smarter implementation.
[2958.42 → 2962.46] So with the Thief demo that we both listened to, I could tell a big difference.
[2962.46 → 2967.66] It was much more like when it was off, it sounded like, like you said,
[2967.76 → 2969.56] like everyone was just like talking to the microphone.
[2969.76 → 2969.94] Yeah.
[2970.10 → 2971.18] Like very flat.
[2971.26 → 2975.40] But when they turned it on, you could kind of hear like the audio kind of like echoing a little bit around the room,
[2975.66 → 2976.36] hear the footsteps.
[2976.88 → 2981.10] I mean, I don't think it was this massive quantum leap and just like blew my mind,
[2981.10 → 2984.72] but compared with it on and off, I could tell a major difference.
[2984.84 → 2988.10] And especially with a game like Thief, which is kind of like, you know, sneaking around and.
[2988.40 → 2989.36] Very sound oriented.
[2989.72 → 2991.14] Yeah, absolutely very sound oriented.
[2991.40 → 2995.52] You know, I think another good game or a lot of games that could really, you know,
[2995.58 → 2998.04] benefit from this would be like first-person shooters because, you know,
[2998.08 → 3000.66] obviously you're trying to listen for footsteps and whatnot.
[3000.84 → 3003.50] And if you could kind of hear them a little bit more detail,
[3003.70 → 3007.18] kind of maybe figure out where they are in 3D space just a little bit better.
[3007.18 → 3010.54] I mean, obviously you're when you're dealing with headphones, you're not, you know,
[3010.54 → 3015.02] you don't have a 20 speaker set up to, you know, precisely pinpoint everything.
[3015.18 → 3016.74] But I think it's a step in the right direction.
[3016.84 → 3021.72] I don't know if it was worth, you know, the 45 minutes they spent doing demos on it.
[3021.74 → 3024.30] I mean, it's cool, but yeah.
[3024.62 → 3024.98] Okay.
[3025.06 → 3026.80] I mean, I agree with you 100%.
[3026.80 → 3033.20] Better immersive ness and anything that takes load off the CPU and enhances your gameplay experience,
[3033.20 → 3041.30] especially with Mantle, which is going to allow the game to take better advantage of the power of your GPU
[3041.30 → 3045.16] and take better advantage of your CPU by utilizing more cores.
[3045.26 → 3048.50] Well, why don't we just not waste any of that processing power on sound any more then?
[3049.26 → 3051.44] Why don't we just have it dealt with by the graphics card?
[3051.50 → 3055.58] So the last advantage of real sound, in addition to allowing reverberations,
[3055.68 → 3058.16] which is a lot of calculations, like more like physics sound,
[3058.16 → 3062.10] the other advantage is that in terms of directionality,
[3062.10 → 3068.66] it should be able to be much more accurate than something that's relying on something other than the game engine itself
[3068.66 → 3070.62] to give it directional cues.
[3071.08 → 3075.28] So the fact that the processing is going on at a much earlier stage in the pipeline
[3075.28 → 3078.38] is going to mean that cheesy things that I've never liked,
[3078.48 → 3083.48] I mean, you guys must know this, like USB surround sound dongles and surround headphones.
[3083.48 → 3088.20] Guys, if you're longtime viewers, I'm not real enthusiastic about them.
[3088.80 → 3090.78] I mean, Austin, do you feel the same way?
[3091.10 → 3092.06] Oh, yeah, definitely.
[3092.22 → 3094.28] So this sounds like a much better way to do that.
[3094.36 → 3097.52] So we have a little thing that we do called Twitter Blitz,
[3097.56 → 3098.90] and I'd love for you to participate.
[3099.48 → 3103.12] So I'm going to read out Twitter questions that are actually intended for you,
[3103.22 → 3109.70] and I'd love you to hit the audience with the answers as fast as you possibly can.
[3109.76 → 3110.72] That's the whole objective.
[3111.46 → 3111.74] All right.
[3111.76 → 3112.40] All right, let's do it.
[3112.40 → 3115.94] Will BlackBerry be just a company that we used to know, or will they make a comeback?
[3117.00 → 3119.02] They will probably fade out.
[3119.14 → 3120.70] I don't think they'll totally go out of business
[3120.70 → 3123.22] because they still do have a pretty strong hold on the enterprise,
[3123.60 → 3125.30] and it sounds like they're going to be bought.
[3125.64 → 3128.42] But as far as, you know, people like us being able to buy them,
[3128.64 → 3129.90] yeah, I think that's about done.
[3130.12 → 3131.02] What do you think of the Note 3?
[3132.06 → 3133.92] I haven't been able to really try it yet.
[3134.12 → 3135.08] Well, you were hands-on.
[3135.20 → 3135.90] You were hands-on.
[3135.96 → 3136.46] I was there.
[3136.46 → 3137.90] I saw you touch it.
[3138.36 → 3140.76] Somewhat, although that actually didn't happen, so shh.
[3140.76 → 3147.66] I think the Note 3 is hilariously big compared to the iPhone because I've been using the 5S the last couple of days.
[3148.86 → 3149.98] Yeah, I mean, I'm excited.
[3150.32 → 3156.56] I missed the giant battery and the giant screen of the Note 2, so looking forward to getting myself a Note 3.
[3156.56 → 3158.12] Someone's building a system.
[3158.22 → 3159.82] What CPU and graphics card for gaming?
[3161.58 → 3161.86] What?
[3162.08 → 3165.24] That's like, what kind of money are they spending?
[3165.38 → 3165.66] I don't know.
[3165.82 → 3166.18] Exactly.
[3166.30 → 3167.18] That's the correct answer.
[3169.22 → 3169.98] Here we go.
[3170.74 → 3172.28] Someone's asking about unreleased stuff.
[3172.52 → 3174.78] What do you think of flexible displays for phones and tablets?
[3174.78 → 3178.74] I think it'll be cool, but not in the way a lot of people think.
[3178.98 → 3180.88] You're not going to have a phone, and you just bend it.
[3181.16 → 3185.28] What it's going to be more like is that instead of having the display being square,
[3185.78 → 3190.84] imagine that the side of the phone, it kind of like tapers down and the screen follows the taper.
[3191.42 → 3196.56] So there's actually a shot, I think, of a CES a couple of years ago where Samsung showed this off where
[3196.56 → 3199.26] it's a normal screen from the front, but when you look at it from the side,
[3199.26 → 3202.10] the screen just keeps on going all the way and wraps over the edge.
[3202.20 → 3205.84] I think that's where the flexible display is going to come more in handy.
[3206.00 → 3211.06] We're not just going to, you know, your screen, your phone is just not going to be like a piece of plastic or something.
[3211.18 → 3212.60] Unless you have a Galaxy S4.
[3213.68 → 3213.80] Oh.
[3214.62 → 3215.28] Hey.
[3217.68 → 3218.42] Okay, you win.
[3218.48 → 3218.82] Never mind.
[3221.14 → 3223.44] YouTube have also discontinued video responses.
[3223.64 → 3224.66] How do you feel about that?
[3224.86 → 3225.78] I'm going to jump in.
[3225.82 → 3226.62] I'm going to say I don't care.
[3226.80 → 3227.08] Go ahead.
[3227.32 → 3228.54] I'm right there with you.
[3228.54 → 3232.92] I mean, didn't they say something about, like, how the video responses were, like,
[3233.02 → 3234.80] clicked on, like, one in every two million videos?
[3234.88 → 3235.00] Yeah.
[3235.06 → 3236.10] Just something, like, ridiculous.
[3236.10 → 3236.66] Stupid number.
[3237.14 → 3238.02] Yeah, I don't care.
[3238.12 → 3240.88] Thoughts on YouTube adding a music library for their content creators?
[3241.90 → 3246.18] It's good, because I'm tired of hearing the same iMovie music in every single video on YouTube,
[3246.48 → 3249.18] but I'm sure I'll get tired of this music as well.
[3249.18 → 3250.10] I was just going to say, we're just going to read.
[3250.10 → 3251.94] If it's out of the right direction, I'm glad that...
[3251.94 → 3252.16] Yeah.
[3253.58 → 3255.20] Does your camera still work?
[3255.36 → 3257.52] This is from the vlog when your camera got soaked.
[3257.52 → 3258.60] Oh, yeah.
[3258.70 → 3259.00] Oh, yeah.
[3259.20 → 3260.12] It's weather-sealed.
[3260.18 → 3260.80] It was all good.
[3261.06 → 3264.56] We were just running out through the rain because it's Hawaii, and it rains, like, every 10 minutes.
[3264.76 → 3265.42] Yeah, it's all good.
[3265.58 → 3266.68] Here's a great question.
[3267.14 → 3273.16] Scott Horton asks, do you think Mantle will help with emulating the next-gen consoles?
[3273.16 → 3277.94] Because that's been a thing, where you had to have a PC that was 10 times more powerful
[3277.94 → 3281.64] than a PlayStation 1 in order to emulate PS1 hardware.
[3281.64 → 3284.32] Do you think Mantle will make a big difference to that?
[3285.48 → 3286.42] Ooh, that's tough.
[3286.56 → 3287.00] I mean...
[3287.00 → 3288.54] Ooh, that's a good question.
[3288.86 → 3289.50] Theoretically...
[3289.50 → 3293.94] Okay, so theoretically, you could kind of take a look back at, like, the original Xbox,
[3294.20 → 3296.96] which was similarly based to normal PC hardware.
[3297.58 → 3301.20] Just because it's based on the same hardware doesn't necessarily mean that it would be able
[3301.20 → 3303.32] to be emulated, as far as I know.
[3303.32 → 3306.14] I mean, I don't think it would be a bad thing.
[3306.18 → 3313.16] But if it's based on the same hardware and the same API and potentially runs on the same
[3313.16 → 3314.32] graphics architecture...
[3315.44 → 3317.12] It's not really emulation.
[3317.32 → 3317.46] Yeah.
[3317.52 → 3318.28] They're both x86.
[3318.54 → 3318.88] Yeah.
[3319.30 → 3319.76] It's not.
[3319.76 → 3320.28] It's not.
[3321.00 → 3321.24] Yeah.
[3321.82 → 3324.28] I doubt that you'll be able to just, like, load a game up.
[3324.38 → 3325.44] The software is still going to...
[3325.44 → 3327.72] I strongly believe it's going to be very much locked down.
[3327.80 → 3331.56] The operating system, as far as, like, how you'll be able to, you know, get the Xbox
[3331.56 → 3333.16] One operating system, PS4.
[3333.62 → 3336.90] I don't think it's a bad thing, but I don't think it's just going to be open season to
[3336.90 → 3340.22] just throw PS4 and Xbox One games on your system anytime soon.
[3340.48 → 3341.62] Valid response, sir.
[3342.38 → 3344.56] Favourite retro and non-retro game?
[3344.64 → 3344.80] Go.
[3345.78 → 3346.68] Oh, okay.
[3346.82 → 3347.26] Retro.
[3348.48 → 3349.84] Can I say Gran Tourism?
[3350.04 → 3350.98] Does that count as retro?
[3350.98 → 3351.78] Oh, come on.
[3351.84 → 3353.00] You're so young, dude.
[3353.08 → 3353.64] How old are you?
[3354.44 → 3355.18] Dude, yeah.
[3355.64 → 3356.80] That's, like, retro for me.
[3356.86 → 3358.02] I played that when I was, like, four or five.
[3359.10 → 3361.26] I mean, favourite non-retro game?
[3361.72 → 3364.74] Actually, I'd probably have to say Metro Last Light, as far as, like, games I've played
[3364.74 → 3365.10] recently.
[3365.22 → 3365.40] Okay.
[3365.46 → 3367.04] I really, really enjoyed that.
[3367.58 → 3368.02] All right.
[3368.50 → 3372.78] Last one, and this is from some jackass that...
[3372.78 → 3374.24] I hate that guy.
[3374.80 → 3379.04] He says, you're not going to tell anyone what happened in Hawaii, right?
[3379.04 → 3380.34] We made a pact.
[3380.54 → 3382.70] And this is from Paul Hardware on Twitter.
[3384.14 → 3384.98] Yeah, no.
[3385.14 → 3386.26] No comment on that.
[3386.66 → 3389.40] It was an NDA sign that evening that...
[3389.40 → 3390.40] I'm not supposed to talk about this.
[3390.40 → 3391.86] So, no, it didn't happen.
[3392.02 → 3396.42] Paul, I'm sorry, but please don't talk about this anymore.
[3396.88 → 3397.82] It was...
[3397.82 → 3398.22] Yeah.
[3398.44 → 3398.80] Just now.
[3398.92 → 3399.10] Yeah.
[3399.32 → 3400.74] It was super homo.
[3401.22 → 3402.00] So, um...
[3402.00 → 3402.38] Basically.
[3402.82 → 3403.00] Yeah.
[3403.50 → 3404.50] Like, full homo.
[3404.72 → 3404.94] Okay.
[3405.54 → 3406.22] So, um...
[3406.22 → 3406.88] Let's talk about it.
[3406.88 → 3407.98] Did you sign the pact?
[3408.16 → 3409.22] Or did you just, like, ghost pet?
[3409.22 → 3410.22] I signed the pact, man.
[3410.22 → 3411.16] I signed that pact.
[3411.54 → 3411.66] Okay.
[3411.86 → 3412.74] We all signed the pact.
[3412.82 → 3414.64] And the fact that Paul's even talking about it.
[3414.64 → 3418.56] Like, he's opening himself up to, like, some serious legal ramifications.
[3418.80 → 3419.12] Oh, good.
[3419.12 → 3420.76] Because part of the pact was to not talk...
[3420.76 → 3422.08] You don't talk about Fight Club.
[3422.10 → 3422.60] First two rules.
[3422.96 → 3425.32] First two rules of the pact.
[3425.34 → 3427.40] But the first two rules inherently teach you to break rules.
[3428.00 → 3428.70] I don't care.
[3429.26 → 3429.82] Well...
[3429.82 → 3430.00] No.
[3430.16 → 3430.60] No.
[3430.60 → 3430.68] No.
[3430.76 → 3431.24] You weren't...
[3431.24 → 3432.24] You don't know...
[3432.24 → 3432.96] You don't know...
[3432.96 → 3433.54] I'm just saying...
[3433.54 → 3435.08] You don't know how homo it was.
[3436.52 → 3437.60] Let me put it this way.
[3437.68 → 3439.98] It's almost as homo as when we spend time together.
[3440.46 → 3440.82] Wow.
[3441.32 → 3442.22] That's pretty intense.
[3442.24 → 3442.50] Yeah.
[3442.62 → 3443.52] It's intense homo.
[3443.54 → 3444.12] Holy cow.
[3444.20 → 3444.92] So, um...
[3444.92 → 3445.36] So, anyway.
[3445.48 → 3446.68] Enough talking about homo.
[3446.78 → 3447.78] Austin, if you want to...
[3447.78 → 3448.46] Please, please.
[3448.46 → 3449.46] Plug your stuff.
[3449.82 → 3451.46] Because if a few people don't...
[3452.06 → 3452.26] Okay.
[3452.38 → 3452.86] That...
[3452.86 → 3454.46] That was...
[3454.46 → 3456.14] Did I violate the pact?
[3457.18 → 3458.42] I think it did.
[3458.84 → 3459.08] Okay.
[3460.04 → 3460.44] Dude.
[3460.96 → 3462.04] Talk up your YouTube.
[3462.30 → 3463.10] Talk up your Twitter.
[3463.10 → 3465.68] I want our live viewers to know how awesome you are.
[3465.76 → 3467.58] Go subscribe to you and get that done.
[3467.62 → 3468.56] This is the greatest segue ever.
[3468.68 → 3469.34] Thank you.
[3469.78 → 3470.10] Um...
[3470.10 → 3472.50] So, uh...
[3472.50 → 3473.92] If you want stuff that has...
[3473.92 → 3476.42] Videos that have absolutely nothing to do with what we just talked about.
[3476.78 → 3477.80] That kind of tech stuff.
[3477.92 → 3478.96] You guys can, uh...
[3478.96 → 3480.24] Check me out on YouTube.
[3480.44 → 3480.62] Uh...
[3480.62 → 3482.44] YouTube.com slash Austin Evans.
[3483.10 → 3483.42] Uh...
[3483.42 → 3484.10] I swear...
[3484.64 → 3485.34] This...
[3485.34 → 3486.90] Just forget about this last bit.
[3487.02 → 3487.20] Okay.
[3487.20 → 3487.38] Okay.
[3487.46 → 3488.46] It's nothing to do.
[3488.74 → 3491.66] There are no videos of that anywhere on YouTube.
[3491.88 → 3492.28] So, don't...
[3492.28 → 3493.10] Don't think the look.
[3493.18 → 3497.86] But if you want to check my channel out for maybe other stuff that doesn't include Paul and Linus, uh...
[3497.86 → 3498.78] You can do that.
[3499.00 → 3500.48] So, YouTube.com slash Austin Evans.
[3500.54 → 3500.74] All right.
[3500.74 → 3500.90] Cool.
[3500.96 → 3506.70] And guys, just another reminder is Austin and I are doing a collaborative iPhone 5C giveaway.
[3507.44 → 3510.26] So, make sure that you're subscribed to both of us.
[3510.26 → 3513.94] So, you'll have a chance to win one of two iPhone 5C phones.
[3514.04 → 3515.20] We are giving away two phones.
[3515.62 → 3515.78] All right.
[3515.86 → 3516.56] Thank you, Austin.
[3516.66 → 3518.06] You've been a fantastic guest.
[3518.06 → 3519.42] There's still a week left on that, too.
[3519.56 → 3520.92] So, we need time to get in on it.
[3521.06 → 3521.60] Lots of times.
[3521.72 → 3522.76] So, thank you very much.
[3522.96 → 3523.44] And, uh...
[3523.44 → 3525.08] We'd love to have you on the show again.
[3525.28 → 3528.34] And it was a real pleasure meeting you in person for the first time, man.
[3530.02 → 3530.38] All right.
[3530.44 → 3530.90] And, hey.
[3530.98 → 3531.54] Thanks for having me.
[3531.60 → 3531.92] And, uh...
[3531.92 → 3532.52] I will catch you later.
[3532.66 → 3532.88] All right.
[3532.92 → 3533.26] Take care.
[3533.70 → 3534.04] See ya.
[3535.10 → 3535.54] All right.
[3535.58 → 3536.64] So, let's switch back to our...
[3536.64 → 3538.22] To our no guests.
[3538.32 → 3538.64] And, actually...
[3539.20 → 3539.62] You know what?
[3539.62 → 3542.44] I'd love to make this a moment to thank our sponsors.
[3542.68 → 3543.22] So, guys.
[3543.40 → 3547.96] This is actually the last show in our current deal with our Intercom sponsorship.
[3548.24 → 3548.94] So, if you want...
[3548.94 → 3552.32] If you haven't downloaded Intercoms yet, you haven't tried it out yet, it's still in beta.
[3552.50 → 3559.42] But, it is the way to communicate with your gaming buddies over voice chat that really has gamer-centric features.
[3559.66 → 3564.68] Doesn't have that Skype bug that does still allow people to find your IP, which is a real problem.
[3564.68 → 3565.80] Um...
[3565.80 → 3571.04] And, it has an overlay that makes it so it doesn't boot you out of your games when people call and kills you and stuff like that.
[3571.12 → 3571.54] So, guys.
[3571.68 → 3572.56] Do check it out.
[3572.62 → 3573.66] It helps us out a lot.
[3573.76 → 3576.74] And, as one big last push, use that bit.ly link right there.
[3576.80 → 3581.74] It makes us look real good to our sponsors when you guys do download the software and try it out.
[3582.06 → 3582.68] Next up...
[3582.68 → 3587.94] For guys who haven't been on in a long time, there's a huge patch recently, which fixed a bunch of stuff and a bunch of UI changes and all that.
[3587.94 → 3588.66] Like, just as...
[3588.66 → 3590.50] Just to be real clear about it, guys.
[3590.50 → 3595.50] We were paid to have the show sponsored and to do our live callers with comes.
[3595.58 → 3600.84] But, the big part of the reason for that was we were going to use it anyway because Slick legit uses it.
[3601.04 → 3601.26] Yeah.
[3601.36 → 3602.18] With his gaming group.
[3602.26 → 3602.52] I do.
[3602.94 → 3608.30] And so, we didn't just randomly choose something and just take money from someone to do this.
[3608.36 → 3610.44] So, that's a big part of why that happened.
[3611.20 → 3611.68] Alright.
[3611.86 → 3615.42] So, let's move on to our next sponsor, which is Squarespace.
[3615.96 → 3620.00] So, Squarespace is the easy way to create a beautiful website for yourself.
[3620.00 → 3630.42] In fact, I'm going to fire up the linusmediagroup.com website, which can be accessed whether it's on your notebook or desktop or phone or tablet or whatever else.
[3630.78 → 3632.38] Their over 20 profiles...
[3632.38 → 3633.06] Oh, okay.
[3633.14 → 3634.12] Thank you for changing that for me.
[3634.46 → 3640.38] Their over 20 profiles are able to adapt to different screen sizes, different ways of accessing them.
[3640.44 → 3642.00] You can dynamically change it apart.
[3642.00 → 3643.20] The hosting is included.
[3643.34 → 3650.14] And, in fact, if you buy one of their full year accounts, then they will even throw in a domain for you for free.
[3650.34 → 3657.04] So, there are a lot of different ways that you can get your site looking exactly how you want it, whether it's a blog or whether it's a little store.
[3657.20 → 3659.08] In fact, there's a back end that's built in.
[3659.16 → 3662.40] So, you can actually create your own store online using it.
[3662.40 → 3670.32] If you use offer code LINUS9, so that is the specific one for September, they're actually doing a special promotion.
[3670.50 → 3681.88] So, 20% off for a free trial and to get 20% off on your first purchase as opposed to 10% off, which is what they usually do, then go over and check that out.
[3681.94 → 3683.88] Squarespace.com, Linus8.
[3683.88 → 3686.74] The last thing is, guys, this is not just for noobs.
[3686.92 → 3690.90] If you want to dive into the CSS and HTML, they do have an advanced mode.
[3691.08 → 3702.10] So, while it's simple enough that Easel or I can work on it, it's not the kind of thing that Slick's just going to get frustrated and throw his keyboard and mouse at the screen and walk away from.
[3702.44 → 3703.30] Maybe just mouse.
[3703.40 → 3704.18] Maybe just a mouse.
[3704.64 → 3705.72] I like my keyboards.
[3706.02 → 3706.70] So, that's Squarespace.
[3707.02 → 3708.28] And next up, we've got Hotspot Shield.
[3708.40 → 3711.38] And this is going to be Slick's first attempt at doing a sponsor read.
[3711.38 → 3713.42] So, you've got 30 seconds, which is our commitment.
[3713.88 → 3715.32] I think you went a lot longer than 30 seconds.
[3715.52 → 3718.38] But anyway, Hotspot Shield is a really easy to set up VPN.
[3718.60 → 3722.08] And you might be wondering what the heck a VPN is and why you might want one.
[3722.36 → 3727.26] So, in the wake of all the NSA stuff, it's a way to protect what you're doing on the Internet.
[3727.38 → 3729.22] And it's not perfect, to be clear.
[3729.40 → 3733.20] Like, we're not just trying to, like, sell you Hotspot Shield and it fixes everything.
[3733.42 → 3733.58] No.
[3733.88 → 3734.72] But it's better than nothing.
[3735.06 → 3738.18] It's not perfect, and you can see through it, but it's really difficult.
[3738.18 → 3742.04] And it's just a really simple way to pretty easily mask what you're doing.
[3742.04 → 3745.08] And also allow you to get around certain things.
[3745.22 → 3752.38] So, say Linus is like, oh, I'm going to block Google at work because I'm a big jerk and don't understand how media companies work.
[3753.26 → 3754.24] He wouldn't do that.
[3754.28 → 3759.48] But if he did, I could install Hotspot Shield on, say, my phone or my laptop or whatever and then get around that.
[3759.48 → 3766.70] So, say you're in a situation where you have free Wi-Fi, but you really need to access your email, and it's, like, it's actually really freaking important.
[3767.14 → 3769.32] You can have Hotspot Shield up, access your email.
[3769.54 → 3771.10] Your email or anything else you might want to access.
[3771.10 → 3772.64] Or anything else you might want to access, yeah.
[3772.78 → 3774.68] So, it's good for security.
[3774.84 → 3777.06] It's good for getting around certain bits of security.
[3777.26 → 3778.48] And regional locks as well.
[3778.66 → 3784.16] So, things like if you want to access American Netflix, and you're not located in the U.S. that can help you with that.
[3784.16 → 3790.90] It will slow down your connection speed, to be clear, because remember, the traffic is actually being completely rerouted.
[3790.94 → 3791.72] That's how it works.
[3791.82 → 3797.70] Yeah, because it's a VPN, all your network traffic is going through a different computer before it goes and does what it's actually supposed to be doing.
[3797.70 → 3804.62] Yeah, so Hotspot Shield is actually offering 20% off elite prices using the code LINUS.
[3804.78 → 3810.72] So, you can check out the bit.ly down there, bit.ly slash share, and you guys can check that out.
[3810.72 → 3817.68] And again, so huge thanks to Razor Comes, Squarespace, and Hotspot Shield for making the WAN show possible for you guys.
[3818.08 → 3825.24] We ran it for a long time just with us basically not getting paid at all just because we wanted to do this content.
[3825.74 → 3832.38] And having sponsors helps us to continue to make it better, invest in more equipment, and just keep making the show better for you guys.
[3832.46 → 3835.10] In fact, I mean, our audio mixer is like this big now.
[3835.18 → 3837.74] We're still learning how to use it, which is why you hear that hiss right now.
[3837.74 → 3843.50] But having sponsors is really going to help us continue to develop not only this show, but more shows.
[3843.70 → 3849.92] I haven't really talked about this much yet, but we are going to – the masses have spoken.
[3850.32 → 3851.84] You guys want the WAN show.
[3851.98 → 3853.44] You want a long-format show.
[3853.52 → 3854.60] We're going to keep doing that.
[3854.64 → 3861.00] But we're also going to be adding some more targeted, focused, shorter shows throughout the week.
[3861.00 → 3864.24] And I haven't talked to you about this yet, but I think they're going to end up on Tech Quickie.
[3864.84 → 3865.04] Okay.
[3865.16 → 3866.10] I think that'll make sense.
[3866.18 → 3868.54] So Tech Quickie will be mostly fast as possible.
[3869.04 → 3876.02] And then either daily or three times a week or whatever we decide on updates for certain little news items that we keep very short.
[3876.22 → 3879.10] So, for instance, we could have covered all the individual Steam updates.
[3879.34 → 3879.48] Yes.
[3879.48 → 3880.90] Which would have actually been really nice.
[3880.90 → 3889.52] And much more timely and giving you guys, like, you know, a reason to get your news from us as opposed to a reason to just hear us sort of wax philosophical about what it all means.
[3889.64 → 3889.74] Yeah.
[3890.06 → 3895.38] Speaking of waxing philosophical about what it all means, let's get into the Steam announcement.
[3895.64 → 3896.94] So, number one.
[3897.40 → 3898.32] That segue, right?
[3898.46 → 3901.26] That was – you've got some pretty epic segues.
[3901.36 → 3901.80] Thank you.
[3902.40 → 3903.28] Steam OS.
[3904.32 → 3904.72] Boom.
[3904.84 → 3906.00] Big head explosion.
[3906.28 → 3906.88] So, go.
[3906.88 → 3908.68] This one was kind of insane.
[3908.94 → 3911.76] Like, I actually was not expecting this one at all.
[3912.14 → 3914.32] The other two, I guessed both of them.
[3914.40 → 3916.38] But this one was kind of out of left field.
[3916.38 → 3916.80] Well, okay.
[3917.22 → 3924.12] We kind of saw Steam OS coming because we were expecting Steam Box to have some kind of Steam-y customized OS.
[3924.50 → 3928.78] I just expected it to be a like, custom version of Ubuntu, not its own thing.
[3928.84 → 3930.48] And I expected it to be somewhat closed.
[3930.78 → 3930.92] Yeah.
[3930.98 → 3935.28] I expected Steam Box to be a Steam Box and you didn't build your own Steam Box.
[3935.28 → 3937.86] Maybe they partnered with others to build Steam Boxes.
[3937.98 → 3941.08] But, like, I thought it was going to be a pretty hardcore lockdown.
[3941.44 → 3943.04] But that got completely obliterated.
[3943.14 → 3943.80] Oh, no.
[3944.12 → 3948.78] You can download the raw source code for this if you want and change it in any way you want.
[3948.84 → 3949.54] They do not care.
[3949.68 → 3950.98] Which is amazing.
[3951.16 → 3954.46] They even said – actually, I'm not going to jump to that quite yet.
[3954.72 → 3956.20] But, like, there's a ton of cool stuff.
[3956.28 → 3956.96] So, it's on Linux.
[3957.14 → 3960.68] And I know a ton of you in the audience that haven't read up on this right now are going,
[3960.80 → 3962.60] oh, so I can't play, like, any of my games.
[3963.06 → 3963.34] Wrong.
[3963.34 → 3967.96] That's totally wrong because if you have your desktop PC, which I'm assuming most of you already have,
[3968.18 → 3974.60] you can stream Shield-style your Windows games over to your Steam Box that is running on the TV.
[3974.64 → 3976.22] Which is, like, amazing.
[3976.50 → 3977.02] That's perfect.
[3977.14 → 3978.06] So, we could – I mean, okay.
[3978.48 → 3982.32] Why do people like me say, look, I'm not interested in Linux?
[3983.34 → 3983.96] Because –
[3983.96 → 3985.84] It's too complicated, and it can't play the games that you want to play.
[3985.84 → 3986.56] It's not that complicated.
[3986.74 → 3987.08] I have used Ubuntu a little bit.
[3987.08 → 3988.36] It's too complicated for some people.
[3988.36 → 3988.70] Okay.
[3989.08 → 3991.34] But the fact that it doesn't – you can't game on it.
[3991.56 → 3991.70] Yeah.
[3991.70 → 3994.16] It's just the stupidest thing ever from my perspective.
[3994.16 → 3996.64] It's like, look, I want the machine that is the all-rounder.
[3996.84 → 3997.02] Yeah.
[3997.08 → 3998.72] That does everything reasonably well.
[3998.76 → 3999.90] And that's Windows right now.
[4000.56 → 4003.58] The fact that you can stream games – I mean, look at it this way.
[4003.58 → 4009.80] NVIDIA has invested heavily in this game streaming technology, which is interesting from a cloud gaming perspective.
[4009.80 → 4012.50] But we're years and years away from that being feasible.
[4012.80 → 4017.82] But from a local streaming perspective is actually much more relevant to me.
[4017.94 → 4022.10] And NVIDIA has shown already that they can do this over wireless.
[4022.64 → 4025.80] There is no reason I would want to run my Steam Box wirelessly.
[4025.80 → 4038.04] If I wire up my house with like 10 gigabits, which is going to come eventually to consumer-grade prices, all of a sudden, holy crap, my Windows box lives in a closet.
[4038.58 → 4042.94] My Windows home server is now my Windows home server.
[4043.36 → 4047.14] And every other machine in the house could be running Linux, and I could game to my heart's content.
[4047.14 → 4056.56] I was even going to say, this would be fascinating because if you had – say you're a dad, and you still want to have your beast computer because you're going to do other stuff like video editing or whatever.
[4056.80 → 4058.40] But then you've got your kids that are just going to game.
[4058.66 → 4064.08] You could have like a central beast computer instead of building beast computers for each one of your kids.
[4064.14 → 4064.26] Yeah.
[4064.40 → 4065.98] And then just give them Steam Boxes.
[4066.10 → 4067.78] Which is just amazing.
[4067.92 → 4070.66] I mean, this is – remember when NVIDIA first announced Grid?
[4071.26 → 4073.10] This is exactly what I was talking about.
[4073.14 → 4073.24] Yeah.
[4074.08 → 4076.44] Personal cloud compute.
[4076.44 → 4077.16] And that's awesome.
[4077.18 → 4080.28] As opposed to personal cloud storage, which is fascinating and all that.
[4080.42 → 4083.64] And WDD has a new product coming that we're going to check out that apparently makes it much simpler.
[4083.84 → 4084.00] Cool.
[4084.12 → 4087.44] But personal cloud compute is just –
[4087.44 → 4087.62] So cool.
[4088.20 → 4088.84] BOMB!
[4088.84 → 4090.10] I'm so excited about this.
[4090.28 → 4091.48] And I mean, you know what?
[4091.58 → 4094.76] Kudos to Valve for taking us in this direction.
[4094.90 → 4099.90] This is such a big deal because when they talked about supporting Linux in the longer term, I went, yeah, that's fascinating.
[4100.06 → 4103.84] We can run portal on Linux or whatever in this big performance hit.
[4103.84 → 4107.84] But now, all of a sudden, whoa, boom, mantle hits us this week.
[4108.20 → 4113.00] Porting to different OSes, we're not going to rely necessarily on Direct3D or OpenGL anymore.
[4113.54 → 4114.00] Boom.
[4114.22 → 4120.42] And then the fact that now we're going to be able to run our games using streaming from a separate computer on Linux.
[4120.62 → 4121.30] So beast.
[4121.30 → 4127.00] And there are a couple other announcements even aside all of that insane awesomeness that you grab right away.
[4127.52 → 4131.76] Stuff like my little local co-op backdoor thing.
[4131.86 → 4132.12] Yes.
[4132.12 → 4132.76] Not going to work.
[4132.92 → 4133.12] Okay.
[4133.22 → 4133.74] Right, right.
[4133.80 → 4134.84] With the game sharing.
[4135.06 → 4135.24] Yeah.
[4135.38 → 4141.22] But you could – so even though you couldn't like play against each other, what you could do is you could have a Steam box in the living room.
[4141.22 → 4147.32] And you could share your library with a separate account because Steam still won't support multiple logins of the same person in different locations.
[4147.92 → 4149.68] And that's what a great solution that is, right?
[4149.78 → 4149.94] Yeah.
[4150.16 → 4152.38] So I will have two accounts now.
[4152.48 → 4155.76] I will have my account that I don't really buy anything on, which is my Steam box account.
[4156.04 → 4159.32] And I'll have my main desktop account, and I'll just share everything with that account.
[4159.36 → 4160.18] And that's totally fine.
[4160.50 → 4162.16] I just can't play games concurrently.
[4162.22 → 4163.42] So I can take turns.
[4163.58 → 4167.40] So if I had a buddy over, and he wanted to play on my Steam box computer, we couldn't play the same game.
[4167.40 → 4170.06] But as long as we take turns playing different games, it's totally fine.
[4170.08 → 4170.80] Play on the same time.
[4171.00 → 4171.74] Oh, man.
[4171.88 → 4172.32] That's great.
[4172.46 → 4177.22] And I'd be interested to see if they had the capability to add multiple licenses of a game to a single Steam account.
[4177.96 → 4179.08] That would be fascinating.
[4179.10 → 4180.14] That's actually not a bad idea.
[4180.20 → 4182.78] If anyone from Valve is watching, I'd actually like to see that.
[4182.86 → 4184.86] That ties in really well with their family options.
[4184.90 → 4185.20] Yes.
[4185.28 → 4188.42] So they have a family options thing where you can hide certain games from other people.
[4188.62 → 4190.96] Based on ESB ratings or preference.
[4190.96 → 4200.04] So Hotline Miami, which is a crazy good game, but I would never let anyone under the recommended age play because it's nuts.
[4200.38 → 4204.34] Like this is like GTA style where you don't want little kids playing this game.
[4204.86 → 4205.64] Awesome game.
[4205.92 → 4206.78] Dad might own it.
[4207.08 → 4208.32] Doesn't want to share it with his kid.
[4208.48 → 4209.28] He can now hide it.
[4209.34 → 4209.94] That's brilliant.
[4210.18 → 4212.62] But that could tie in with the multiple licenses' thing.
[4212.88 → 4214.00] Yeah, that would be really cool.
[4214.14 → 4214.32] Yeah.
[4214.68 → 4215.12] Okay.
[4215.26 → 4216.88] So Steam announcement number two.
[4217.04 → 4219.28] I guess we kind of talked about it a fair bit.
[4219.28 → 4220.62] So Steam Machines.
[4222.06 → 4224.58] It's kind of tied into the first one in a big way.
[4225.08 → 4229.36] To be kind of blunt, it's not fascinating because we all knew this was coming.
[4229.60 → 4229.72] Yeah.
[4230.16 → 4232.12] We all knew this was going to be one of these.
[4232.42 → 4232.78] OMG.
[4232.98 → 4233.98] Valve's going to have a console.
[4234.20 → 4234.36] Okay.
[4234.44 → 4234.64] Yes.
[4234.68 → 4235.02] Got it.
[4235.18 → 4235.54] Yeah.
[4235.66 → 4236.72] Valve's going to have a console.
[4237.00 → 4237.26] Okay.
[4237.46 → 4237.66] Fine.
[4237.90 → 4241.72] For interesting things to bring up, they're going to be shipping 300 prototypes of it this
[4241.72 → 4242.00] year.
[4242.08 → 4244.26] So sometimes within 2020, maybe.
[4244.26 → 4249.28] But they'll be shipping 300 prototypes to people that have completed the quest.
[4249.40 → 4253.80] The quest is basically stuff that you've probably already done plus play a big picture game with
[4253.80 → 4254.20] a controller.
[4254.38 → 4254.50] Yeah.
[4254.84 → 4258.82] There's going to be 30 of these prototypes that are given to people that are big contributors
[4258.82 → 4259.66] to the community.
[4260.02 → 4262.60] Probably people that have made things that go up on the market.
[4262.96 → 4268.66] But then 270 of them will be completely randomly selected out of people that have completed
[4268.66 → 4269.20] that quest.
[4269.20 → 4274.32] So if you check out store.steampower.com slash living room slash steam machines, you can
[4274.32 → 4277.68] see everything you have to complete for that quest, which is interesting.
[4278.48 → 4282.22] And the non-prototype versions are supposed to be available sometime in 2014.
[4282.48 → 4284.08] So I'm expecting somewhere around 2030.
[4286.64 → 4290.44] I'm wondering how Valve Time is going to play into all of this, actually, because they're
[4290.44 → 4293.86] putting out fairly solid release dates.
[4293.94 → 4298.22] I mean, to me, Steam Machines basically sounds like Windows Machines.
[4298.22 → 4302.86] Like, it's basically just another way of saying it's a computer that will have hardware in
[4302.86 → 4304.50] it that's going to run the Steam OS.
[4304.82 → 4310.60] And I think that particularly when you look at a community like Steam, we're going to see
[4310.60 → 4311.46] a lot of DIY.
[4311.80 → 4315.96] A lot of DIY Steam Machines as opposed to, like, I think it's going to be a lot like the
[4315.96 → 4319.48] Hackintosh community where people don't buy a Hackintosh.
[4319.88 → 4324.30] What they do is they head over to Tony Mac x86 or whatever that site is.
[4324.42 → 4325.44] That's awesome, by the way.
[4325.46 → 4326.96] If you ever want to build a Hackintosh, just go there.
[4326.96 → 4328.00] It's, like, done for you.
[4328.52 → 4329.38] Buy the hardware.
[4329.88 → 4330.44] Build it themselves.
[4330.80 → 4332.36] And it's a very rewarding experience.
[4332.62 → 4334.20] And you're going to get better performance for your dollar.
[4334.32 → 4338.64] And all those great things that go along with that, that is where things are going to get
[4338.64 → 4338.90] real.
[4338.92 → 4341.06] They've actually said, so there's going to be a Valve version.
[4341.50 → 4344.08] And the Valve version is going to be highly customizable.
[4344.52 → 4345.46] And you can build your own.
[4345.52 → 4347.12] And that will obviously be highly customizable.
[4347.48 → 4351.00] But then the ones built by other people will be focused around different metrics.
[4351.00 → 4356.88] So size, price, thermal output, sound, stuff like that.
[4356.92 → 4359.22] And with a free OS, we're going to have a lot of flexibility.
[4359.60 → 4365.00] And particularly for DIY guys, we're going to see a bigger price disparity between DIY and
[4365.00 → 4365.62] off the shelf.
[4366.00 → 4371.42] Because with Windows, the big manufacturers like Acer or Lenovo are getting massive discounts
[4371.42 → 4372.16] on the software.
[4372.60 → 4374.96] Whereas when you build one yourself, you're paying full retail.
[4374.96 → 4382.66] So even though you're able to build your PC for slightly cheaper, you paid that inflated margin to Microsoft for a standalone OS.
[4382.84 → 4389.72] Whereas now, when both OSes are free, now that decreases our price even more by a much larger margin.
[4389.84 → 4391.42] So I'm really excited about DIY.
[4391.72 → 4392.58] That's a perfect point, yeah.
[4392.72 → 4394.98] Steam machines or whatever they want to call them.
[4395.12 → 4398.22] I'm so excited because I've wanted to build a small form factor computer for a while, but
[4398.22 → 4399.62] never had that big of a reason.
[4400.76 → 4403.76] Steam announcement three.
[4403.76 → 4404.36] Boom.
[4404.96 → 4406.60] The Steam controller.
[4407.08 → 4412.08] So I'm going to go ahead, and I'm going to fire this up for you guys because you're going to need to see it to believe it for this one.
[4412.22 → 4412.44] Yeah.
[4412.82 → 4416.56] A new way to play your entire Steam library from the sofa.
[4416.92 → 4418.00] So there's a dog and a cat.
[4418.16 → 4419.08] They're cardboard cutouts.
[4419.32 → 4419.76] Boom.
[4420.48 → 4421.46] There it is.
[4423.64 → 4425.76] I legitimately thought this was the back.
[4427.42 → 4430.92] Especially actually because of how where your hand goes kind of works.
[4431.92 → 4432.78] And how it looks.
[4432.78 → 4435.30] But, um, yeah.
[4435.50 → 4436.88] I'm going to keep letting that sink in.
[4436.88 → 4445.00] So my first conclusion, and I find it funny because if you scroll up to where it shows
[4445.00 → 4448.00] the home theatre, it's like, oh, okay, here, sorry, I'm not on my screen anymore.
[4448.00 → 4448.56] Yeah, go ahead.
[4448.72 → 4448.88] Go ahead.
[4448.94 → 4453.82] They have Civ 5 on screen, which I thought was hilarious because before I noticed that,
[4453.88 → 4459.00] I was like, the only game I really think it's like you can use this controller to play Civ 5.
[4459.00 → 4461.62] And then they had Civ 5 on the screen.
[4461.72 → 4464.04] I was like, oh, someone thought of that.
[4464.60 → 4464.92] Okay.
[4465.46 → 4470.64] So let me, let's, why don't we start with some of the specs because that's really important.
[4470.76 → 4472.28] It's got 16 total buttons.
[4472.28 → 4475.18] So the trackpads themselves are buttons.
[4475.32 → 4477.70] The touchscreen in the middle has four buttons at the corners.
[4478.26 → 4482.36] There's a few, look more like navigational buttons under the screen itself.
[4482.44 → 4485.56] Actually here, I'm going to, I'm going to fire that up again for you guys so you can see
[4485.56 → 4486.52] what I'm talking about.
[4486.52 → 4491.52] And the real killer app here are these touchpads.
[4492.34 → 4498.36] So there's the touchscreen here and then the touchpads here and here that have what Valve
[4498.36 → 4507.46] is calling the most advanced haptic feedback that we've yet seen in a consumer device.
[4507.92 → 4513.90] So to be clear, haptic feedback, if you ever used like a Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1, the original
[4513.90 → 4518.16] one where it just kind of like felt like a big piece of poo every time you touched it
[4518.16 → 4524.06] and it kind of went like when you touched it, and it felt like it was falling apart.
[4524.62 → 4527.32] Valve's going for not that.
[4527.86 → 4535.56] They're going for something that actually will give you tactile feedback about not just where
[4535.56 → 4539.04] your fingers are on the pad, and you know, the curvature will help with that as well,
[4539.04 → 4546.42] but also things like acceleration, boundaries, threshold, speed, textures, action confirmations
[4546.42 → 4547.72] or any other events.
[4548.08 → 4551.94] They're saying these are so advanced that they're basically speakers and as a little trick you
[4551.94 → 4556.64] could actually have them play music or make sound effects if you really wanted to.
[4557.72 → 4562.30] Now what I noticed immediately because this was the one that actually out of all the Steam
[4562.30 → 4566.88] announcements, this was the one where I not only read the Valve page.
[4566.88 → 4567.96] That you read the...
[4567.96 → 4572.32] And another article, but I went and found like a dozen articles because I was like, what
[4572.32 → 4573.72] are people saying about this?
[4573.96 → 4575.84] I read hundreds of user comments.
[4575.98 → 4580.12] I actually spent a lot of time this morning looking at this and here's what I found.
[4580.42 → 4584.98] User comments, people are either saying it's bullshit, it's the stupidest thing I've ever
[4584.98 → 4590.62] seen, or they're saying, hold on, give this a chance, it's Valve, they haven't done wrong
[4590.62 → 4592.66] by us too many times in the past.
[4592.66 → 4597.82] And then there's like the one guy in a hundred who's stoked on it and then professional writers
[4597.82 → 4600.70] basically all opted to say nothing.
[4601.18 → 4601.22] Yeah.
[4601.32 → 4605.26] I couldn't find anyone who gave an opinion on it and I didn't read every article, but
[4605.26 → 4607.56] they were all just like, here's Valve's press release.
[4608.94 → 4616.08] And they just said nothing, which to me is a big indicator that they're real skeptical about
[4616.08 → 4619.82] this, but they don't want to be the guy that said it was balls, and then it turns out to
[4619.82 → 4620.30] be amazing.
[4620.30 → 4624.94] I'm going to actually bounce back, I made the comment about Civ V earlier, but after
[4624.94 → 4629.34] typing that in, and I have it here being like, you're only really going to be able to play
[4629.34 → 4634.48] Civ V, but after typing that in, depending on how good the touchpads are, actually was
[4634.48 → 4640.56] playing GTA V last night and I noticed the only way I can aim at people is by pulling the
[4640.56 → 4643.52] left trigger repeatedly, which will make him automatically point at people.
[4643.86 → 4644.02] Yeah.
[4644.02 → 4651.78] Because without that, I'm like, I'm wondering, can I actually be more accurate with a touchpad
[4651.78 → 4653.18] that's super, perfect?
[4653.28 → 4657.68] Versus, I mean, for me, a big problem with joysticks is that every, every game under the
[4657.68 → 4660.16] sun seems to have the calibration a little bit differently.
[4660.16 → 4667.24] And the response of them compared to something like force feedback actually isn't that great.
[4667.42 → 4667.50] No.
[4667.82 → 4674.10] So if this, between the curvature and the haptic feedback, like if it gets more intense towards
[4674.10 → 4678.64] the outer edges for a racing game, if we're talking almost like fake force feedback.
[4678.64 → 4683.04] And looking at the style of these touchpads, actually one thing I was thinking about is
[4683.04 → 4687.22] if one of them was a wheel in a racing game, you could spin it as if it was a wheel.
[4687.64 → 4688.98] So there's, there's actually.
[4689.18 → 4690.50] I don't see that being practical.
[4691.02 → 4691.94] But you probably could.
[4691.94 → 4693.16] But you maybe could.
[4693.50 → 4696.80] And like, it's, it's, it's just, and how movable they are.
[4697.04 → 4698.28] They're incredibly movable.
[4698.28 → 4700.32] Yeah, they're coming out and saying they want it to be hackable.
[4700.48 → 4700.78] Oh yeah.
[4700.86 → 4701.42] Right up front.
[4701.60 → 4701.76] Yeah.
[4702.06 → 4705.56] So, so with it being valved, with it being this movable.
[4705.62 → 4705.76] Yeah.
[4705.76 → 4708.44] Because the mod community is going to go crazy and make this thing nuts.
[4708.86 → 4711.02] It, maybe they can pull it off.
[4711.12 → 4713.30] Does it replace a keyboard and mouse?
[4713.48 → 4714.26] No, of course not.
[4714.32 → 4714.92] But they don't say it.
[4714.94 → 4718.72] But you can plug that into your Steam box and use a couch master anyway.
[4719.04 → 4720.18] Does it replace a keyboard?
[4720.48 → 4721.30] No, of course not.
[4721.46 → 4723.90] But you could still have something like a little wireless keyboard.
[4724.00 → 4724.54] Where is ours?
[4724.58 → 4725.48] I think it's like lost.
[4725.80 → 4729.04] You could have a little wireless keyboard with a little track ball on it.
[4729.38 → 4733.44] Anyway, to me, I see this not even necessarily as a replacement for something like an Xbox
[4733.44 → 4737.58] 360 controller, which is like the finest controller ever made, other than the D-pad is kind of
[4737.58 → 4738.12] a pile of poo.
[4740.00 → 4740.98] It's not a replacement.
[4741.18 → 4743.34] It's more like, here's another way.
[4743.58 → 4745.10] And it will open the doors.
[4745.48 → 4745.66] One thing I know is...
[4745.66 → 4746.74] It's a compatibility tool.
[4746.86 → 4747.00] Yeah.
[4747.00 → 4752.94] I don't think they wanted to make another, like, dual thumb stick with the D-pad and four
[4752.94 → 4754.12] buttons and two thingies.
[4754.20 → 4757.20] Like, they didn't want to recreate something that everyone has made under the sun.
[4757.28 → 4761.70] But with that said, before I'd seen any pictures, and before I'd read any articles, the first
[4761.70 → 4764.62] word out of my mouth was retarded when I heard about it.
[4764.74 → 4767.82] And I kind of went, well, are they being different for the sake of being different?
[4767.82 → 4770.90] And then I kind of let myself sort of calm down and...
[4770.90 → 4773.24] Honestly, I haven't even read any of the extra articles on it.
[4773.30 → 4775.28] This is all just stuff I noticed while looking through theirs.
[4775.42 → 4775.62] Okay.
[4776.06 → 4778.06] But it's going to enable...
[4778.06 → 4780.66] Like, I would never play Civ V with a default controller.
[4780.66 → 4781.22] Yeah, you can.
[4781.50 → 4783.18] But I would play Civ V with this.
[4783.32 → 4784.92] I wouldn't want to play a lot of simulation games with a lot of controllers.
[4784.92 → 4787.32] I mean, it's kind of like when Warcraft 2 came out on PlayStation.
[4787.74 → 4788.28] It's ridiculous.
[4788.28 → 4789.06] Where it's, like, ridiculous.
[4789.28 → 4791.16] Whereas this might bridge the gap?
[4791.40 → 4791.62] Yep.
[4791.84 → 4796.64] And then a lot of simulation games, like, especially freaking Surgeon Simulator, like, that makes
[4796.64 → 4797.64] so much more sense.
[4797.64 → 4797.96] Right.
[4798.14 → 4800.42] Then with, like, it's interesting.
[4800.58 → 4802.28] So I think it's going to open a lot of doors to other things.
[4802.60 → 4806.82] And then stuff like shooters, with the right modding community behind it, maybe you can
[4806.82 → 4807.60] be way more accurate.
[4807.64 → 4810.56] Because I have a serious problem with controllers right now.
[4810.64 → 4810.74] Yeah.
[4810.86 → 4812.32] So maybe it will help.
[4812.36 → 4817.12] And maybe it will help bridge the gap between PC gamers into the living room a little bit
[4817.12 → 4817.28] more.
[4817.34 → 4819.82] Because the second I touch a controller, I'm like, blah, what is this?
[4819.84 → 4820.40] I don't know what I'm doing.
[4820.58 → 4820.84] All right.
[4820.92 → 4824.00] Someone's hitting me pretty hard in the Twitch chat there.
[4824.16 → 4825.74] Linus, what does he say?
[4825.74 → 4827.86] Something like, stop avoiding the question.
[4828.26 → 4829.44] Do you think it will be good?
[4829.44 → 4840.12] And I'm going to say, based on the one person I found on Twitter who has tried an early
[4840.12 → 4840.82] version of it.
[4840.90 → 4845.40] So LordChrisRemo on Twitter, who says, I tried it.
[4845.60 → 4849.98] The button configuration was different at the time, but the cursor pads worked amazingly
[4849.98 → 4850.50] well.
[4850.50 → 4852.28] I don't know who this guy is.
[4852.42 → 4853.64] Never talked to him.
[4853.82 → 4858.02] No idea why he has, you know, 13,000 followers on Twitter or whatever else.
[4859.06 → 4865.08] But he says, yes, the haptic feedback makes it feel like you're actually operating a real
[4865.08 → 4868.88] physically mechanical device, not just a touchscreen.
[4869.40 → 4869.52] Wow.
[4869.52 → 4874.76] If I found someone who tried an early sample and is saying that about it, if I inherently
[4874.76 → 4876.86] trust Valve, which I kind of do.
[4877.00 → 4877.10] Yeah.
[4879.10 → 4879.78] You know what?
[4879.86 → 4880.86] Here, I'll go ahead and say it.
[4880.88 → 4884.18] I'll say there's going to be a learning curve, because I think we can all agree on that,
[4884.50 → 4885.98] but it's going to be usable.
[4886.98 → 4892.06] It's definitely, it's like, I don't even think you can debate if it'll be usable or not.
[4892.22 → 4894.40] No, I would have questioned it at the beginning.
[4894.40 → 4899.26] For Civ V and other simulation games, it'll obviously be better than, in my opinion, than
[4899.26 → 4901.38] a controller with thumb sticks.
[4901.78 → 4906.26] But I think it'll be, depending on how good those touchpads are, and if you take his word
[4906.26 → 4910.56] for all the merit it could be taken for, it could be great.
[4910.90 → 4913.50] But the touchpad, touchpads scare me.
[4913.60 → 4917.42] I'm a big advocate of overuse of touchpads are ridiculous, because when you go to the
[4917.42 → 4921.56] store, and you have to use the debit machine, and you only have to select what account you
[4921.56 → 4924.38] want to use with the freaking touchpad, and it's like, why do I have to, why do I
[4924.38 → 4925.04] have to do this?
[4925.34 → 4925.90] It's like, that's overuse.
[4925.90 → 4929.56] A necessary touch sucks, but if they've done it well, then great.
[4929.68 → 4934.76] So I want to move on to, this is actually one of our, we're running out of time here,
[4934.90 → 4938.18] but I feel like this is probably going to be our last big topic this week.
[4939.26 → 4948.02] BitTorrent has a legit reason for existing that goes beyond, like, Linux distros, which
[4948.02 → 4951.64] is obviously the joke that pirates make, is why do you have U-Torrent on your computer?
[4951.64 → 4953.52] Because I download Linux distros.
[4955.38 → 4958.60] The art is the cash, so this is an article on VentureBeat.
[4958.68 → 4959.82] The art is the cash register.
[4959.96 → 4962.28] BitTorrent releases bundles in alpha.
[4962.58 → 4965.94] So you guys should definitely check out the full article, but I'm just going to go back
[4965.94 → 4967.26] to my notes here really quick.
[4967.26 → 4973.96] So what bundles will do is they will bundle content and a payment system.
[4974.28 → 4978.74] Now we're not talking payment system like cash money necessarily.
[4979.06 → 4980.86] We're talking about some kind of content.
[4981.12 → 4981.48] It could be.
[4981.74 → 4986.64] We're talking some kind of content, whether it's music or movies or like, I mean, honestly,
[4986.64 → 4992.46] I saw this, and I've been thinking about doing like a vlog series or like a behind the scenes
[4992.46 → 4996.88] series, hiring like a dedicated guy to just do that around here for a while.
[4997.06 → 4999.60] But I don't necessarily want that everywhere.
[5000.02 → 5004.62] And I don't want, and I've promised my viewers that we are not going to move to a pay model.
[5005.24 → 5006.88] So I've done those things.
[5006.98 → 5008.44] Make it like a, like a, so.
[5008.78 → 5008.98] Oh.
[5009.12 → 5009.28] Okay.
[5009.32 → 5009.66] Hold on.
[5009.66 → 5014.40] So bundles could contain some kind of content that you pay for, but not necessarily with
[5014.40 → 5014.80] cash.
[5014.92 → 5016.32] So here are some suggestions.
[5016.88 → 5022.70] Maybe you pay for it with a like, a tweet, an email address, or newsletter sign up.
[5024.34 → 5025.34] Holy crap.
[5025.82 → 5026.66] That's amazing.
[5027.50 → 5030.88] Maybe you pay for it by seeding, although I don't know how, I don't know how that could
[5030.88 → 5031.56] be enforced.
[5031.78 → 5036.80] But, but all of a sudden there's flexibility to the payment that comes along with content.
[5037.30 → 5039.54] It's been being said for years.
[5040.08 → 5041.58] That the problem is not.
[5041.58 → 5042.08] The distribution.
[5042.56 → 5042.88] Yes.
[5043.06 → 5043.22] Go.
[5043.40 → 5043.60] Okay.
[5043.66 → 5044.24] You talk about it.
[5044.24 → 5046.68] The problem is the Steam has said this a lot.
[5047.06 → 5053.52] Um, because people have been seeing, uh, piracy rates go down as their games go on Steam instead
[5053.52 → 5055.06] of being their own launcher.
[5055.06 → 5058.72] Like if you have to download the executable install itself, your piracy rates are going
[5058.72 → 5060.10] to be higher than if it's on Steam.
[5060.50 → 5063.10] Because people see it on Steam, and they're like, oh, that's easy.
[5063.34 → 5064.86] It's going to work all the time.
[5065.10 → 5066.62] I don't have to deal with all these problems.
[5066.62 → 5071.04] But then it's also not DRM down my throat and absolutely ridiculous the whole time.
[5071.24 → 5071.28] Yeah.
[5071.28 → 5074.68] So I'll just buy it on, there's still DRM on Steam, but it's much easier to deal with.
[5075.02 → 5076.28] Um, so I'll just get it on Steam.
[5076.40 → 5079.06] So Gabe Newell has been saying distribution is a problem forever.
[5079.06 → 5083.10] Everyone knows that the main reason things are pirated is that they're so freaking
[5083.10 → 5083.94] hard to get.
[5084.64 → 5086.58] So, like, it's annoying.
[5086.58 → 5089.14] It's, it's, well, a large part of the reason.
[5089.14 → 5089.16] Okay.
[5089.16 → 5090.78] A reason that things are pirated.
[5090.78 → 5091.72] A large part of the reason.
[5091.82 → 5092.44] A reason.
[5092.68 → 5093.58] Let's say a reason.
[5093.70 → 5094.22] I'm still saying a reason.
[5094.22 → 5097.18] We can, okay, well, I will say a reason because I don't necessarily agree with that.
[5097.28 → 5100.76] Well, as music has become easier to get, piracy rates have massively gone down.
[5100.84 → 5101.22] That's true.
[5101.26 → 5102.20] So it's a large part of the reason.
[5102.20 → 5103.42] But piracy still exists.
[5103.52 → 5103.72] Yeah.
[5103.72 → 5105.00] So let's say a reason.
[5105.12 → 5105.88] I'm still saying large.
[5105.88 → 5109.84] Until, until piracy is gone, we can't empirically determine.
[5110.24 → 5111.30] I'm not saying the reason.
[5111.44 → 5112.52] I'm saying a large part of.
[5112.76 → 5113.22] How do we know?
[5114.14 → 5115.20] We can't, we can't determine.
[5115.20 → 5116.68] Because the percentage has gone down by so much.
[5117.12 → 5117.52] Okay.
[5117.58 → 5121.12] Until we know how much piracy there actually is exactly, we won't know.
[5121.32 → 5122.38] You can pretty easily calculate.
[5122.38 → 5124.20] You can guess, but you won't know for sure.
[5124.28 → 5126.10] You can get pretty freaking close.
[5126.12 → 5126.80] We disagree.
[5126.80 → 5127.64] But anyway.
[5129.10 → 5129.58] Yeah.
[5129.80 → 5130.42] It'll help.
[5130.66 → 5130.86] Yes.
[5131.18 → 5131.42] Okay.
[5131.98 → 5133.66] Artists are going to love this.
[5133.72 → 5140.24] Because instead of their music, like if they kind of go, okay, people are going to download things off, off of torrents anyway.
[5140.54 → 5148.70] And if they happen to take that philosophy and go, okay, well then what I'll do is I'll include, um, in order to, I'll, I'll just, I'll just seat it out there myself.
[5148.74 → 5151.72] And as long as you follow me on Twitter, then I'm down.
[5152.18 → 5152.62] Then I'm down.
[5152.68 → 5153.00] Go ahead.
[5153.06 → 5154.30] Have the have, have the song then.
[5154.42 → 5160.18] Especially musicians lately are releasing their albums for free anyway because they find no point because not enough people are buying them.
[5160.50 → 5161.90] Especially when they're smaller musicians.
[5161.90 → 5172.12] So if you, if you released a new version of it every once in a while that requires people to tweet about your upcoming concert or to, uh, link on your Facebook to their merchandise store.
[5172.12 → 5173.88] Holy crap.
[5173.92 → 5174.96] That helps them more.
[5175.02 → 5175.38] That's the future.
[5175.68 → 5175.86] Yeah.
[5175.94 → 5176.94] I mean, that's amazing.
[5177.10 → 5181.60] So Madonna, Linkin Park, Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart already using it.
[5182.00 → 5187.08] Um, Tim Ferriss says it drove an additional 880,000 Amazon impressions for his book.
[5187.16 → 5191.60] In his experience, there is no faster method for getting multimedia content to the fans.
[5191.60 → 5197.02] This is, is just totally game changing and I think goes a long way towards legitimizing BitTorrent.
[5197.20 → 5197.44] Yeah.
[5197.62 → 5202.02] That's because for the longest time, BitTorrent's been like, we're not actually bad.
[5202.12 → 5202.44] Really?
[5202.54 → 5206.52] We're not just for pirating, but we can't tell you what else we're for.
[5206.88 → 5208.64] We're, we're, we're a tool.
[5208.98 → 5209.70] Just people are using us.
[5209.70 → 5212.74] There's like four dudes that have released their albums on it.
[5212.74 → 5218.52] Like you could probably also find them on like the YouTube or a billion other places.
[5219.06 → 5221.32] Um, so this is, this is amazing.
[5221.64 → 5222.78] And it's perfect for them.
[5223.24 → 5228.72] I think this week, rather than trying to go really in depth into some of the other content that we have,
[5228.76 → 5230.72] I think we call that it for our major topics.
[5230.90 → 5233.20] I want to, I want to blitz through a couple here.
[5233.26 → 5235.64] I mean, BlackBerry has a potential suitor.
[5236.00 → 5237.14] Um, I think it, what was it?
[5237.18 → 5238.84] Nine billion or something like that.
[5238.84 → 5239.96] $9 per share.
[5240.08 → 5241.24] I think it's $47 billion.
[5241.36 → 5241.52] Sorry.
[5241.52 → 5242.80] $9 per share.
[5243.26 → 5247.34] And, um, I was talking to Sam Reynolds from VR Zone while I was at the AMD event.
[5247.38 → 5252.40] And he was saying, uh, one of the reasons he thinks it could potentially happen in time
[5252.40 → 5256.56] is that it is a Canadian, um, interest that's looking at them.
[5256.56 → 5261.90] And that actually could save months of investigation and analysis and all that.
[5261.94 → 5265.92] Like if they want the if they want foreign investors to come in and own the company,
[5265.92 → 5268.56] which is traditionally a Canadian company.
[5268.56 → 5274.18] Um, I mean that, and that, I think would make a lot of people feel a lot better about it as well.
[5274.18 → 5278.54] Um, so that was, um, that was one of the big things this week, obviously.
[5278.54 → 5280.36] Uh, this is pretty funny.
[5280.36 → 5285.64] A fake Apple ad says iOS 7 will make your iPhone waterproof and people fell for it.
[5285.64 → 5291.70] So the update claimed that iOS 7, uh, will in an emergency shut off your phone's power supply
[5291.70 → 5295.76] and corresponding components to prevent any damage to your iPhone's delicate circuitry.
[5295.76 → 5300.30] Um, so apparently people expressed their outrage on Twitter.
[5300.44 → 5305.24] One angry tweeter said, okay, whoever said iOS 7 is waterproof, go F yourself.
[5305.88 → 5308.26] Um, so that's, that's pretty hilarious.
[5308.26 → 5314.68] And I, I, quite frankly, I hope no one watching did that because dude, or do dad or whoever you are.
[5314.72 → 5314.84] Yeah.
[5314.90 → 5315.06] Yeah.
[5315.10 → 5315.74] They're coming for you.
[5316.14 → 5319.94] Um, next up is a Seuss DOG bench.
[5319.94 → 5323.62] Which, I mean, honestly, we don't have enough benchmarking tools.
[5323.92 → 5324.62] We really don't.
[5324.74 → 5327.94] Particularly for certain aspects of the system, like storage.
[5328.20 → 5332.20] There's a few, but they're highly synthetic and, or, or they're expensive.
[5332.34 → 5334.16] Speaking of which, did we get that figured out with Future Mark?
[5334.58 → 5335.28] Did you hear back from them?
[5335.48 → 5335.90] Yeah, I have.
[5336.02 → 5336.12] Yeah.
[5336.24 → 5336.98] Are we, are we doing it?
[5337.02 → 5337.48] Yeah, we're good.
[5337.56 → 5337.78] Okay.
[5337.84 → 5342.56] We are, we are going to be testing using the upcoming, uh, the upcoming Future Mark, what
[5342.56 → 5343.06] is it called?
[5343.14 → 5343.86] Future Mark 8.
[5344.24 → 5346.08] Uh, so we're going to be using that for our storage testing.
[5346.16 → 5347.92] I'm extremely excited about their new suite.
[5347.92 → 5350.54] It looks much more comprehensive than their previous ones.
[5350.86 → 5354.10] But right now, it wasn't available unless you get the Uber license.
[5354.52 → 5356.92] So we've worked out a deal with them to get the Uber license.
[5357.04 → 5359.70] So we're going to be bringing you some of that over the next little bit here.
[5360.00 → 5361.92] Uh, but anyway, this is unrelated to Future Mark.
[5362.02 → 5364.54] This is the DOG Real Bench.
[5364.86 → 5366.18] And Asus has an FAQ.
[5366.32 → 5368.20] It's on rog.asus.com.
[5368.30 → 5372.16] Um, if you just search for DOG Real Bench, free app download, you'll be able to bring that
[5372.16 → 5372.38] up.
[5372.44 → 5377.06] Or you can check out the, uh, the stream doc, which I'll post in the Linus rambling section of
[5377.06 → 5378.00] the Linus Tech Tips Forum.
[5378.18 → 5381.44] But they've got an FAQ here that I think really covered all my questions.
[5381.76 → 5386.82] The first, or the second question is, it's DOG Real Bench, so there must be Asus favouritism,
[5386.92 → 5387.10] right?
[5387.18 → 5387.70] And they're like, no.
[5387.84 → 5392.56] Open source apps, no Asus bias at all.
[5392.62 → 5393.72] I like that it's open source apps.
[5393.86 → 5394.46] Love it.
[5394.74 → 5395.14] Love it.
[5395.20 → 5395.84] I mean, this.
[5396.16 → 5401.02] This is one of the things that I really feel like companies can do to differentiate their
[5401.02 → 5401.42] products.
[5401.50 → 5402.82] It has nothing to do with the product.
[5402.82 → 5404.74] Things like even AI Charge.
[5404.82 → 5406.08] Have you ever used AI Charge from Asus?
[5406.52 → 5406.86] Yes.
[5406.98 → 5408.00] Works on any computer.
[5408.10 → 5408.26] Yeah.
[5408.38 → 5410.56] And allows any USB port to charge a tablet.
[5411.04 → 5411.90] It's like, oh, wow.
[5411.98 → 5412.58] Thank you, Asus.
[5413.04 → 5414.36] Now I, now I think of you.
[5414.46 → 5417.88] I install your app on my computer, regardless of what kind of computer it is.
[5418.04 → 5419.78] That is, that is marketing.
[5419.98 → 5421.28] That is like awesome marketing.
[5421.38 → 5423.98] Because then the first name that will come to mind when you go to buy something is going
[5423.98 → 5424.22] to be them.
[5424.22 → 5429.58] So if every, if every overclocked starts using DOG Real Bench, like that gets that branding
[5429.58 → 5429.90] out there.
[5429.98 → 5433.54] I mean, another example, our sponsor, Racer, Racer Comes.
[5433.64 → 5434.52] Make it for everyone.
[5434.66 → 5436.62] Don't require people to buy a bright green headset.
[5437.10 → 5439.16] You know, not everyone wants a bright green headset.
[5439.34 → 5439.88] We get that.
[5439.98 → 5442.02] We saw your, we saw your comments on Twitter.
[5442.26 → 5443.96] We saw your comments in the Twitch chat.
[5444.26 → 5445.82] Does Racer have a not bright green headset?
[5445.98 → 5446.46] Yeah, they do.
[5446.54 → 5448.70] But you know, this one happens to be bright green.
[5449.78 → 5452.52] But, but getting, getting that branding out there is huge to me.
[5452.52 → 5455.96] And there are only a few benchmarks right now, but they're committed to continuing.
[5456.28 → 5458.86] And, and they're taking user submissions for benchmarks.
[5458.98 → 5462.16] So I know I'm going to submit a few that I already think are good ideas that they could
[5462.16 → 5462.38] add.
[5462.48 → 5467.00] And if you guys have some open source benchmarks that you guys would think would be a good
[5467.00 → 5468.44] idea, submit it, and they'll look into it.
[5468.44 → 5470.44] And they're keeping it real and up to date.
[5470.58 → 5471.82] It's X64 only.
[5472.38 → 5476.20] Because they're like, yeah, well, we just think that you need to get with the times if
[5476.20 → 5476.94] you're running X86.
[5477.24 → 5478.26] And I'm more than okay with it.
[5478.26 → 5478.56] Love it.
[5478.68 → 5480.72] I mean, that's like AMD's 290X.
[5480.72 → 5482.62] And no analog output.
[5483.16 → 5484.22] VGA is gone.
[5484.38 → 5486.02] And I'm not talking the connector is gone.
[5486.12 → 5487.10] The pins are gone.
[5487.40 → 5488.00] It's gone.
[5488.62 → 5489.36] And I'm like, good.
[5489.66 → 5492.20] Because that needs to, that needs to go away.
[5492.32 → 5492.74] It's done.
[5492.86 → 5493.00] Yeah.
[5493.06 → 5493.32] It's done.
[5493.42 → 5493.90] Buy VGA.
[5494.22 → 5495.88] So I'm really excited about that.
[5495.94 → 5499.42] We'll definitely bring you guys a video in the next little bit once we've had a chance
[5499.42 → 5500.00] to try it out.
[5500.32 → 5503.02] Twitch TV no longer automatically archives broadcasts.
[5503.24 → 5503.88] I think that's a bad way.
[5503.88 → 5506.12] I actually, yeah, yeah, that happened last week to us.
[5506.36 → 5509.34] I actually spent some time talking to their COO at PAX.
[5509.34 → 5512.08] And I have a little bit of insight as to why they're doing that.
[5512.52 → 5517.40] So YouTube has, you know, X number of hours of video uploaded every minute or whatever
[5517.40 → 5518.16] it works out to.
[5518.16 → 5523.32] But they transcode it, which, even though it's processing intensive, dramatically reduces
[5523.32 → 5524.92] the storage requirements on their side.
[5525.04 → 5530.66] Twitch just goes, here we go, full balls to the walls, 1080p game stream that ran for
[5530.66 → 5533.06] 14 hours or how, right?
[5533.56 → 5537.46] Their storage needs were just becoming ridiculous.
[5537.68 → 5538.82] Last week I went for 12 hours.
[5539.28 → 5544.12] Their storage needs were getting ridiculous as they've continued to explode.
[5544.38 → 5547.28] And I mean, they got to invest in network infrastructure.
[5547.28 → 5548.80] They got to invest in processing.
[5548.96 → 5551.04] They got to invest in security and blah, blah, blah.
[5551.18 → 5554.36] It's like, look, we bought enough hard drives already.
[5554.70 → 5555.92] Everyone just calmed down.
[5556.66 → 5559.76] So I totally understand why they're doing that.
[5559.92 → 5562.54] He didn't tell me at the time that they were planning to implement this.
[5562.58 → 5566.28] But what he did say is our storage needs are getting ridiculous.
[5566.64 → 5567.74] We have to do something.
[5568.14 → 5569.72] And you can still enable them.
[5570.04 → 5572.88] They're just not enabled by default, which I think is a perfect compromise.
[5572.88 → 5573.36] Yeah.
[5574.94 → 5579.82] NVIDIA has come out and said, you know, we really want to support Linux.
[5580.52 → 5581.76] They've sent out some tweets.
[5581.86 → 5582.74] We're all about gaming.
[5582.90 → 5584.18] We feel gaming is so important.
[5584.68 → 5586.56] And Linus Torvalds has actually responded.
[5586.66 → 5591.04] So NVIDIA kind of said, look, a thousand-watt PC will not lose to a 200-watt Xbox,
[5591.78 → 5593.90] even though most PCs aren't running at a thousand watts.
[5593.90 → 5597.80] And they say they want to support Linux in the wake of Steam.
[5598.04 → 5602.38] And hopefully they'll be able to leverage Mantle or some kind of Mantle-like technology.
[5602.92 → 5605.18] It's apparently been confirmed that Mantle is open.
[5605.64 → 5606.26] I wasn't.
[5606.60 → 5610.04] So that's my comments in the document earlier.
[5610.22 → 5613.00] And when I was talking, I got kind of corrected by YouTube.
[5613.14 → 5614.62] But I had no idea it was open.
[5614.72 → 5615.48] I thought it was just AMD.
[5615.82 → 5616.44] I thought it was.
[5616.60 → 5618.80] AMD didn't say it was open during the presentation.
[5618.96 → 5619.10] Yeah.
[5619.20 → 5620.24] I watched the presentation.
[5620.24 → 5623.56] So that's apparently been confirmed now.
[5623.94 → 5625.14] So I really doubt.
[5625.14 → 5625.86] That's really cool.
[5625.92 → 5628.92] I doubt NVIDIA would be willing to do it.
[5629.06 → 5629.54] Let's see.
[5629.94 → 5631.26] Let's see if NVIDIA.
[5631.42 → 5631.82] They can.
[5631.98 → 5633.12] A lot of AMD stuff's open.
[5633.80 → 5634.18] I know.
[5634.26 → 5637.00] But it's not like NVIDIA really focuses on OpenCL.
[5637.26 → 5637.72] I know.
[5637.84 → 5638.40] I'm just saying.
[5638.60 → 5640.38] Like, I'm not surprised that it is that way.
[5640.48 → 5641.58] I was watching the presentation.
[5641.70 → 5642.34] They didn't say it.
[5642.34 → 5647.34] So Linus Torvalds has responded to this commitment saying, you know, famously,
[5647.34 → 5655.26] Linus Torvalds gave the bird to NVIDIA and said, NVIDIA, and I don't have live, like,
[5655.34 → 5657.66] bleeping out of stuff, but, you know, F you.
[5658.16 → 5659.10] F you, NVIDIA.
[5659.34 → 5659.80] Blah, blah, blah.
[5659.94 → 5661.16] You don't support us properly.
[5661.60 → 5664.32] And NVIDIA's come out and said, look, we're going to do an open driver.
[5664.64 → 5669.94] Well, they've been, it's been publicly known that NVIDIA has been the hardest hardware
[5669.94 → 5671.90] manufacturer for Linux to work with at all.
[5672.02 → 5676.10] So he's basically said, look, I'm not willing to issue an apology for that yet, but let's
[5676.10 → 5676.54] wait and see.
[5676.54 → 5677.56] Let's give him a chance.
[5677.86 → 5679.10] And my battery just died.
[5679.48 → 5682.58] So, um, builds of the week, I guess, let's, uh, let's move on.
[5682.60 → 5686.02] Or do we have any other topics that are, I feel like that's not that important.
[5686.16 → 5686.58] That's more of like, yeah.
[5686.58 → 5687.32] I just thought it would be funny.
[5687.44 → 5687.96] Yeah, it's funny.
[5688.02 → 5688.18] Okay.
[5688.30 → 5689.02] I should have put it in after.
[5689.02 → 5690.74] There's a there's an upcoming, uh, movie.
[5690.92 → 5692.78] You want to cover that while I load up the builds of the week?
[5692.88 → 5693.90] It's not really a big deal.
[5693.94 → 5695.04] I was going to bring it up in after party.
[5695.24 → 5699.12] I just put it in the wrong section, but there's an upcoming Hollywood film that is based
[5699.12 → 5701.46] on the great Quebec maple syrup heist.
[5701.56 → 5704.44] So it's starring Jason Segel or Segal.
[5704.54 → 5705.54] I'm not actually Segal.
[5705.54 → 5706.06] Segal?
[5706.12 → 5706.26] Yeah.
[5706.40 → 5706.98] Jason Segel.
[5707.42 → 5708.48] Um, yeah.
[5708.56 → 5712.42] And it's based on the $18 million syrup heist, which is pretty beast.
[5713.04 → 5715.90] Um, I just wish there were 14 members of the team.
[5715.98 → 5717.60] Apparently there was, uh, 24.
[5718.30 → 5722.04] So if there's 14, it would, it would, it would be like Ocean's 14 maple syrup edition.
[5723.04 → 5725.48] But, oh well, that's unfortunate.
[5725.74 → 5729.18] I was, I was really hoping when I was reading through, I, I remember this because it's based
[5729.18 → 5729.82] on a real event.
[5730.06 → 5730.32] I was really hoping.
[5730.32 → 5731.18] There are the lugs of the week.
[5731.72 → 5732.86] Uh, it's in the WAN folder.
[5733.30 → 5733.78] WAN folder.
[5733.90 → 5734.06] Okay.
[5734.36 → 5734.90] I'll find it.
[5735.10 → 5740.38] Um, I was, I was really hoping because I was, I like to reread the old news article when
[5740.38 → 5743.16] they were talking about this massive heist of maple syrup.
[5743.32 → 5746.82] And I was really hoping it was a team of 14 people, but it was 24.
[5746.96 → 5747.62] So it's close enough.
[5747.70 → 5750.70] So I'm, I'm calling this movie unofficially Ocean's 24.
[5750.70 → 5754.70] Um, because I love the Ocean's movies and I love to heist movies because I just think they're
[5754.70 → 5755.16] so cool.
[5755.24 → 5755.64] Me too.
[5755.92 → 5757.52] They're just, they're, yeah, they're awesome.
[5757.66 → 5760.28] So we're going to hopefully get to the slide soon here.
[5760.30 → 5761.98] Yeah, no, I'm, uh, I'm, I'm ready to rock.
[5762.04 → 5763.84] I think scene six is not the one.
[5764.00 → 5764.40] Okay.
[5764.60 → 5765.86] So let's go ahead and remove that.
[5766.00 → 5767.36] Let's add a screen region.
[5767.46 → 5767.74] Boom.
[5767.80 → 5769.46] Add the whole screen and boom.
[5769.58 → 5770.54] Build logs of the week.
[5770.56 → 5772.44] And well, okay, let's make it big.
[5772.68 → 5773.34] There you go.
[5773.34 → 5773.92] Better than that.
[5773.96 → 5774.42] All right.
[5774.46 → 5774.94] Here we go.
[5775.02 → 5778.38] From the beginning, liquid cooled fractal by DG.
[5778.38 → 5782.62] So this is just, yeah, fairly self-explanatory.
[5783.22 → 5784.56] It's just freaking beautiful.
[5784.92 → 5785.50] I love that.
[5785.66 → 5787.90] It's just, it looks so sharp.
[5787.98 → 5788.92] It looks so clean.
[5789.04 → 5795.54] I maintain the D5 is the only pump that matters, and it's ugly as all sin when you don't custom
[5795.54 → 5796.84] mod it, but this looks great.
[5797.02 → 5797.22] Yep.
[5797.68 → 5799.66] Uh, I've, I've actually seen that quite a bit lately.
[5800.06 → 5800.20] Yep.
[5800.20 → 5800.28] Yep.
[5800.48 → 5801.30] It's become very popular.
[5801.52 → 5807.46] When Biting, or Bit's Power did the first D5 mod kit, I refused to stock it when I was,
[5807.46 → 5809.94] when I was carrying them at NCI because I was like, this is stupid.
[5810.04 → 5812.32] No one's going to pay that much to mod their pumps.
[5812.46 → 5816.32] But what I didn't think about at the time was, well, hold on a second.
[5816.32 → 5819.54] People are going to have owned D5 pumps for two years.
[5819.68 → 5821.30] They're going to have no reason to upgrade it.
[5821.38 → 5825.04] They're going to be redoing their loop, and they're spending less than the amount of buying
[5825.04 → 5827.28] a new pump on just making their old pump look great.
[5827.34 → 5828.54] And D5s are so reliable.
[5828.62 → 5829.88] I've been running mine for years.
[5829.88 → 5833.94] And with, with form factors of computers going down, people want smaller cases to go along
[5833.94 → 5835.70] with it, and you can't really hide them that easily.
[5835.78 → 5836.00] Yeah.
[5836.20 → 5837.54] So you might as well make it look awesome.
[5837.72 → 5838.20] Yeah, exactly.
[5838.32 → 5843.06] Speaking of looking awesome, dim angled fittings, that white tubing, very, very gorgeous.
[5843.30 → 5845.86] So that's the Define R4 for those of you who don't already know.
[5846.06 → 5848.56] It's just a great looking setup he's got right there.
[5849.16 → 5849.46] All right.
[5849.52 → 5851.30] Ultimate cooling machine from Def Boy.
[5851.30 → 5857.98] Hey, this is the first TJ07 build we've featured on the WAN show.
[5858.16 → 5858.54] I don't think so.
[5858.58 → 5859.20] We had the yellow one.
[5860.04 → 5860.66] Was that TJ07?
[5861.30 → 5862.10] I think it was.
[5862.24 → 5862.74] I might be wrong.
[5862.86 → 5863.58] Maybe that was TJ11.
[5863.74 → 5865.14] I think it was TJ10 or TJ11.
[5865.22 → 5865.58] Okay, maybe.
[5865.78 → 5867.72] So do you mind if I take point on this one?
[5867.82 → 5868.14] Go for it.
[5868.16 → 5868.98] Are those hard pipes?
[5869.80 → 5870.94] Oh my goodness.
[5871.16 → 5872.36] This is an amazing build.
[5872.66 → 5872.90] Beautiful.
[5874.28 → 5874.96] Wait, sorry.
[5874.96 → 5876.40] I'm just going to interject one more thing.
[5877.10 → 5879.66] Just like always, be sure to check this out on the forum.
[5879.66 → 5882.62] But this guy especially because he like stripped the whole case himself.
[5882.90 → 5886.00] So he has progress shots of like going down to the metal.
[5886.58 → 5888.10] And it just, it looks awesome.
[5888.18 → 5889.40] And he's got a really nice camera.
[5889.48 → 5890.28] So all of his shots look great.
[5890.28 → 5891.06] This is amazing.
[5891.26 → 5892.74] So there are a couple of things here.
[5892.82 → 5896.86] So first, that front panel, that stealth front panel looks fantastic.
[5897.06 → 5902.32] I personally would have left this so that I can have front USB or a front card reader or something.
[5902.50 → 5906.44] I personally did opt to have that still accessible on mine.
[5906.52 → 5907.30] I think that's important.
[5907.30 → 5911.28] This is something I've seen done before, and I actually wanted to do on mine.
[5911.38 → 5917.52] So this dramatically improves the restrictiveness of the stock grills down here.
[5917.90 → 5919.40] Which they're very, very restrictive.
[5919.50 → 5922.22] And if you do it right, you can get it curved just right.
[5922.30 → 5925.16] And it actually looks very, very, very, very good.
[5925.16 → 5930.40] The fact that the case is painted means that he was able to paint the grill so that it matches the case.
[5930.46 → 5934.86] Which is a problem I've seen with some people who have done this mod where it doesn't match the case anymore.
[5935.26 → 5936.96] These hard pipes are outstanding.
[5937.22 → 5939.18] So that's a liquid-cooled Rampage 4.
[5939.18 → 5942.40] What are these?
[5942.46 → 5944.22] These look like they must be...
[5944.22 → 5944.78] Oh, crap.
[5945.16 → 5945.48] Oh, I don't remember.
[5945.48 → 5946.86] Oh, they're GTX 680s.
[5946.86 → 5948.38] You can tell from the stacked PCIe.
[5948.38 → 5951.36] The stream's so long that by the time we get to this part, I forget the components.
[5951.44 → 5951.88] Yeah, yeah.
[5951.90 → 5952.28] It's fine.
[5952.60 → 5953.26] Oh, man.
[5953.34 → 5954.26] Damn hard pipes.
[5954.78 → 5957.54] XSPC is sort of a funny choice because it's more value-oriented.
[5957.66 → 5959.96] But I'm guessing they were a sponsor for the build or something like that.
[5960.04 → 5960.74] And it looks really sharp.
[5960.78 → 5961.30] And it looks really sharp.
[5961.30 → 5961.96] It goes along with...
[5961.96 → 5963.22] He has a very silver...
[5963.22 → 5964.96] Like, I don't have a shot of his monitors.
[5964.96 → 5966.14] Look at that night shot.
[5966.28 → 5967.60] Yeah, I had to include that.
[5967.80 → 5969.26] But he has a very silver-based thing.
[5969.32 → 5970.28] So it actually kind of works.
[5970.40 → 5973.94] I mean, this ties into the discussion you and I were having...
[5973.94 → 5974.62] Oh, wow.
[5974.70 → 5975.14] There's another one.
[5975.16 → 5975.50] There's another one.
[5975.52 → 5979.72] The discussion you and I were having about how do you shop for RAM these days and, like, by looks?
[5980.00 → 5980.20] Yeah.
[5980.54 → 5982.12] Dominator Platinums, hands down.
[5982.36 → 5983.46] So, yeah.
[5983.94 → 5984.58] Incredibly good.
[5985.10 → 5987.30] But the next one, once you jump along...
[5987.30 → 5987.82] This was...
[5987.82 → 5988.48] DC CCD.
[5988.60 → 5991.00] This was added because of, like...
[5991.00 → 5991.30] Okay.
[5991.30 → 5992.54] It's a nice build.
[5992.72 → 5993.08] Okay.
[5993.22 → 5994.12] What's with that fan?
[5994.32 → 5994.92] That's awesome.
[5995.00 → 5996.38] You're going to be wondering about a few things.
[5996.60 → 5999.00] The main thing that you should be wondering about is actually that.
[5999.28 → 5999.54] Which?
[5999.62 → 6000.60] You got to...
[6000.60 → 6001.06] That.
[6001.62 → 6001.84] That?
[6002.76 → 6003.78] Are you confused yet?
[6003.92 → 6004.20] This?
[6004.26 → 6005.94] This box that goes up here.
[6006.14 → 6007.26] Oh, well, hold on a second.
[6007.40 → 6008.90] This box goes all the way up here?
[6009.58 → 6009.86] Oh!
[6010.16 → 6011.12] Is that all the...
[6011.12 → 6011.68] Wait, what?
[6011.86 → 6012.36] What is this?
[6012.82 → 6013.18] Okay.
[6013.36 → 6016.82] Now that you've seen it, and you see where it's shooting out, and you see, like,
[6016.82 → 6018.20] there's a cut there and a cut there.
[6018.40 → 6018.72] Oh, cool.
[6018.82 → 6019.54] Is that just cardboard?
[6019.84 → 6020.04] No.
[6020.24 → 6021.50] Well, just click forward.
[6021.60 → 6021.84] Fine.
[6022.16 → 6023.38] There is his design.
[6023.72 → 6028.76] So he has built a vent for the basement that can shoot up and then directly flow air over
[6028.76 → 6029.26] his cards.
[6030.92 → 6031.34] Oh, cool.
[6031.34 → 6034.40] I had to include this build, but I also had to include the other builds.
[6035.22 → 6035.76] Oh, cool.
[6035.76 → 6037.14] So this is actually...
[6037.14 → 6043.92] It's funny because this is like a ghetto rig in some ways because this is a very archaic
[6043.92 → 6045.96] way of doing GPU water cooling.
[6046.06 → 6050.08] You can see he's got individual RAM sinks on there for the RAM components.
[6050.22 → 6051.88] He's got, like, air cooling sitting over it.
[6051.96 → 6054.74] Back in the day, we used to use, like, Aztec spot cools for this.
[6054.82 → 6054.94] Yeah.
[6054.94 → 6057.90] And then he's got individual GPU blocks.
[6058.00 → 6062.64] I still have two MCW-60s that you can easily make custom mounting hardware for anything
[6062.64 → 6063.10] you want.
[6063.10 → 6063.76] Aren't they over there?
[6063.98 → 6064.18] Yeah.
[6064.40 → 6065.06] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6065.06 → 6066.04] Yeah, they're in the pile there.
[6066.32 → 6072.60] And at some point, I kind of want to do, like, a dual MCW-60 and my original Apogee liquid
[6072.60 → 6073.08] cool build.
[6073.08 → 6073.22] That would be cool.
[6073.36 → 6073.70] That would be really cool.
[6073.70 → 6074.32] Just for Loss.
[6074.38 → 6077.80] I'd want to redo the mounting hardware and then get it, like, coated...
[6077.80 → 6079.46] I get it powder-coated by Mountain Mods or something.
[6079.50 → 6079.92] That would be cool.
[6079.92 → 6082.96] Although I'm kind of mad at them about my case, but...
[6082.96 → 6084.02] Yeah, that's it.
[6084.10 → 6084.68] But I just...
[6084.68 → 6087.34] I had to include that guy's build because that vent is just...
[6087.34 → 6088.22] That's so cool.
[6088.22 → 6088.92] What a cool...
[6088.92 → 6089.68] What a cool build.
[6089.76 → 6090.56] What a cool idea.
[6090.76 → 6091.58] I like that.
[6091.66 → 6096.54] I mean, it's one thing when we let the manufacturers choose for us how to direct air flow or whatever
[6096.54 → 6101.74] else, but it's a whole other one when we just kind of take matters into our own hands
[6101.74 → 6103.38] and customize things like that.
[6103.46 → 6104.50] Like, nope, this is how it's going to work.
[6104.86 → 6106.16] One quick more thing.
[6106.16 → 6109.70] I think he might be looking up for something, but before we end here,
[6109.92 → 6113.34] I also want to do another shout-out for the Brink and Folding teams.
[6113.50 → 6114.58] We're doing amazingly well.
[6114.64 → 6119.04] I don't have the exact numbers on me right now, which Whaler might try and kill me over
[6119.04 → 6120.74] because he's probably sent them to me.
[6120.86 → 6124.98] But anyway, they're doing incredibly well, so be sure to sign up on those teams because
[6124.98 → 6125.80] it's for a good cause.
[6125.94 → 6126.20] All right.
[6126.24 → 6130.20] Now, I have one last thing for you guys, and I'm going to go ahead and just say this
[6130.20 → 6132.58] outright, what my motivation is for this.
[6132.58 → 6136.74] This is LG's G2 product information video.
[6136.74 → 6140.86] For all intents and purposes, the WAN show is kind of over now, but I would appreciate
[6140.86 → 6145.50] very much if you guys would stay tuned for the next three or four minutes.
[6145.74 → 6150.00] You'll learn a little bit about the LG G2, which is their flagship Android smartphone,
[6150.16 → 6154.24] and could very well, I mean, Marcus Brownlee covered this pretty well in his video on the
[6154.24 → 6158.18] phone, but this could very well be very close to what we're going to see as the next Nexus
[6158.18 → 6158.52] device.
[6158.52 → 6164.74] So, guys, watch the video because I told them, look, okay, yeah, I will, I will, I'll
[6164.74 → 6169.20] put that video out there for my viewers to see if you can get us a phone so we can make
[6169.20 → 6170.32] our own video about it.
[6170.44 → 6174.00] Because otherwise, we don't really have access to phones very easily.
[6174.36 → 6177.92] In particular, LG, we've never worked with them in the past, so I figured maybe this is
[6177.92 → 6179.62] a good way to kick things off.
[6179.84 → 6181.98] And so, guys, if you really don't want to watch it, then tune out.
[6182.30 → 6184.82] Otherwise, please do, please do check it out here.
[6188.52 → 6218.50] Thank you.
[6218.52 → 6248.50] Thank you.
[6248.52 → 6278.50] Thank you.
[6278.52 → 6308.50] Thank you.
[6308.52 → 6338.50] Thank you.
[6338.52 → 6368.50] Thank you.
[6368.52 → 6398.50] Thank you.
[6398.52 → 6400.52] Thank you.
[6400.52 → 6405.52] Thank you.
[6405.52 → 6407.52] Thank you.
[6407.52 → 6412.52] Thank you.
[6412.52 → 6414.52] Thank you.
[6414.52 → 6419.52] Thank you.
[6419.52 → 6426.52] Thank you.
[6426.52 → 6428.52] Thank you.
[6428.52 → 6431.40] because hopefully we can try out some of those features.
[6431.60 → 6435.56] I actually hadn't watched the video yet, to be perfectly honest.
[6436.66 → 6439.06] But we were looking at some of those, kind of wondering,
[6439.22 → 6440.44] okay, well, what are they?
[6440.54 → 6444.36] I mean, the voice mate thing sounded to me kind of like sexting,
[6444.48 → 6446.50] but like voice, like voice mating.
[6447.54 → 6448.98] That's how you got to that.
[6449.74 → 6451.94] I was like, what are you even talking about?
[6452.30 → 6453.26] How does that possibly work?
[6453.26 → 6457.08] We were like whispering to each other during the video.
[6457.08 → 6459.82] We were all like, hey, did you see that?
[6460.30 → 6460.92] That's cool.
[6461.24 → 6463.74] Things like the audio zoom, I think that would be cool stuff
[6463.74 → 6465.38] to just kind of try out and find out if it works.
[6465.44 → 6466.90] So we'd love to get our hands on the phone.
[6467.44 → 6468.96] Without further ado, guys,
[6469.20 → 6471.56] thank you so much for tuning into the WAN show this week.
[6471.62 → 6474.10] I hope you found it to be a fun and enjoyable episode.
[6474.36 → 6477.46] If you're just tuning in now or if you tuned in sort of later on in the stream,
[6477.56 → 6480.54] we always upload the GOD onto YouTube.
[6480.94 → 6484.00] And we are automatically archiving to Twitch still.
[6484.12 → 6484.98] We have that set now.
[6484.98 → 6488.24] So you can also check it out there if you don't want to wait for the YouTube upload.
[6488.42 → 6490.48] But whenever the show doesn't get interrupted,
[6490.78 → 6493.38] we can get it up on YouTube really, really fast.
[6493.48 → 6495.52] As long as they don't, you know,
[6495.58 → 6498.24] put any of those 18 plus restrictions on the videos of us doing so.
[6514.98 → 6528.96] Okay.
[6531.42 → 6533.06] Everyone stop asking me.
[6533.06 → 6536.34] I get so many messages.
[6537.40 → 6540.38] We should just leave this here at the end of every show.
[6541.12 → 6543.42] So people who miss it can just see this.
[6543.56 → 6543.78] Yeah.
[6543.98 → 6545.12] And we should just leave it streaming.
[6545.24 → 6546.12] Okay, guys, that's it.
[6546.26 → 6546.80] Show's over.
[6547.00 → 6548.12] We're just going to leave that there.
[6548.24 → 6550.20] So you all can stop asking us on Twitter.
[6550.68 → 6552.00] We love your Twitter messages.
[6552.20 → 6553.96] We just want you to tweet us about something else.
[6554.66 → 6555.82] We could actually do that.
[6555.98 → 6557.88] Because technically what we could do is end the stream now
[6557.88 → 6559.16] so we have the video file finished.
[6559.36 → 6560.64] Then start streaming again.
[6560.88 → 6562.96] Take off the camera stream so it's not pulling from the mic
[6562.96 → 6564.36] and just leave the computer do this.
[6564.48 → 6564.74] Yeah.
[6565.28 → 6565.50] Okay.
[6565.60 → 6567.80] Maybe like temporarily take off Twitch.
[6567.88 → 6568.36] Peace out, everybody.
