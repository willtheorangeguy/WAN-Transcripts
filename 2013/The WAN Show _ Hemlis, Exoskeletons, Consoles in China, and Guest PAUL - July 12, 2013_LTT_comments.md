We get complaints every time we do anything with the branding and yet from my experience it makes not one bit of difference to viewership one way or the other. When I launched the box falling intro I was met with ENDLESS criticism (actually much worse than this) and yet, no one stopped watching because it's not about the branding, it's about the content. 

Personally I love the new branding but it's impossible to please everyone and hopefully the people who don't like it can ignore it.

Great feedback. Just posting this message so that y'all know we DO listen to your feedback and both Slick and I read every comment that is posted on The WAN Show archives for the first couple of days. We are taking this into consideration and working on how to improve the viewer experience.

363D is "an" answer to this question, but neither slick nor I uses a Sennheiser gaming headset.
