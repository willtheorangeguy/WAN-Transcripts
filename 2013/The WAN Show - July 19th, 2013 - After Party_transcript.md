[0.00 --> 9.90]  Signal. I wonder if that's just like a placeholder. Oh, I think, did Diesel put that there? No, no, apparently that's supposed to be an actual thing.
[9.92 --> 10.20]  Is that a scene?
[11.04 --> 18.26]  I have, no, yeah, it's a scene, but I don't know what scene it is. Avermedia HD capture. It might not be on.
[18.86 --> 23.52]  Oh, it's not on, because you guys dinked with everything. Anyway, guys, welcome to the after party.
[23.52 --> 29.22]  We're trying to get these started as soon as possible, even if we're not completely ready at all.
[29.22 --> 31.36]  Do you want to grab our subway?
[32.12 --> 33.14]  I finished mine.
[33.26 --> 33.94]  You finished yours?
[34.08 --> 34.28]  Yeah.
[34.56 --> 35.60]  Oh, okay.
[35.70 --> 37.88]  You were the one typing and stuff. I was sitting there eating.
[38.12 --> 38.78]  Right, okay.
[39.96 --> 48.64]  So, yeah, we actually had a lot of feedback, not only about the WAN show last week, but also about the after party in general.
[49.00 --> 57.06]  And so the feedback about the WAN show, we take it very seriously, and we want to make sure that we're making that show as awesome as possible,
[57.24 --> 58.58]  and making sure people want to tune in.
[59.22 --> 64.26]  You know, thank you so much to everyone for tuning in tonight. We got, I think we peaked around 4,000 live viewers.
[65.00 --> 67.98]  40-40, I think. I think I saw 40-40 somewhere.
[68.28 --> 74.08]  Something like that. So, over 4,000, which is almost as good as over 9,000, which is our next goal.
[74.16 --> 77.86]  As soon as we hit over 9,000, we have to, like, go Super Saiyan on it.
[78.10 --> 81.68]  Oh, my God. That'll be... We have to make a big deal about that.
[81.68 --> 82.76]  Yeah, that would be awesome.
[83.40 --> 88.66]  But, yeah, for the after party, we took all of the complaints and basically ignored them,
[88.70 --> 91.58]  because the after party is just kind of our thing.
[91.90 --> 95.90]  One thing that we have changed about the after party is we're going to have specific topics to talk about,
[96.14 --> 103.68]  so that if we are focused on our hockey game, we'll, like, have some hints as to what we should probably be talking about right now.
[103.68 --> 106.24]  And, like, we might still play hockey.
[106.54 --> 106.76]  Yeah.
[106.86 --> 108.80]  We're going to play what games we kind of want to play.
[108.80 --> 110.68]  And I really like that hockey game.
[110.92 --> 115.58]  And it's good. And, like, but we are going to try and pull in some newer stuff at the same time.
[116.12 --> 117.06]  We're going to try and play maybe...
[117.06 --> 118.08]  Still have to figure out, like, how to do that.
[118.14 --> 120.06]  I don't even have anywhere to put, like, peripherals here.
[120.10 --> 121.92]  Yeah, we... That's part of the problem.
[122.10 --> 122.74]  Touchmaster, I guess.
[122.92 --> 124.02]  Because it doesn't make a ton of sense yet.
[124.14 --> 129.30]  We'll do it eventually. We want to play stuff like FTL and other games that would just be kind of cool to stream.
[129.74 --> 131.74]  So it'll happen, but...
[131.74 --> 133.54]  And, like, we are listening for After Party.
[133.72 --> 135.64]  Yeah. We just might not do it.
[135.90 --> 136.24]  Yeah.
[137.46 --> 140.04]  Because After Party's more just us hanging out, playing games.
[140.66 --> 140.96]  Yeah.
[142.76 --> 146.12]  And apparently I'm not signed into Twitch anymore, which is kind of annoying.
[146.26 --> 146.88]  Because I'm...
[146.88 --> 152.28]  Like, another thing I want to do in After Party is I want to have that interaction that we sometimes lack in the show now.
[152.64 --> 153.92]  Especially if we're going to have guests.
[154.00 --> 156.02]  So I want to do the live callers in the After Party.
[158.58 --> 159.42]  Twitch.tv.
[159.42 --> 162.12]  I don't know what just happened there, but, like, I got logged out for some reason.
[162.40 --> 163.60]  I want to do the live callers.
[163.66 --> 170.42]  I want to actually interact with Twitch chat a little bit, which is not always easy, but with the raise your dongers and the, uh...
[171.16 --> 175.02]  You know, all the other sort of Wild West stuff that goes on in the Twitch chat.
[176.78 --> 178.00]  It's not letting me sign in.
[179.32 --> 180.02]  Linus Tech.
[182.86 --> 183.22]  Password.
[183.22 --> 183.34]  Password.
[186.22 --> 186.94]  Here we go.
[187.58 --> 188.52]  That would be pretty cool.
[188.70 --> 195.40]  I've played the crap out of Bastion, so if we had a stream that you just played Bastion, and I could just, like, talk about the game and talk about different topics and stuff.
[196.12 --> 196.86]  Yeah, that'd be cool.
[196.98 --> 197.50]  That'd be cool.
[197.58 --> 199.44]  It'd be cool if I could sign in to Twitch right now.
[199.62 --> 200.36]  You don't have...
[200.36 --> 204.14]  I think a lot of the single-player game segments should probably be you playing.
[204.56 --> 207.02]  Because you don't have much time to play games.
[207.02 --> 208.90]  Yeah, thank you for that.
[209.24 --> 212.68]  I can, like, pre-play it and then talk about it while you play.
[213.54 --> 215.84]  That is the saddest thing that I've heard today.
[216.42 --> 218.14]  I'm just trying to help you out, man.
[218.74 --> 220.66]  Trying to make it so you can play more video games.
[221.40 --> 222.50]  What is going on?
[222.50 --> 223.32]  I have no idea.
[224.26 --> 227.92]  I'm trying to sign in to Twitch, and it's just not letting me do it at all.
[230.70 --> 235.70]  Okay, I just opened up Firefox, which is apparently already signed in to Twitch.
[236.02 --> 236.42]  Boom.
[236.42 --> 236.46]  Boom.
[236.80 --> 239.30]  So maybe that's the solution.
[239.60 --> 240.72]  Firefox knew what you wanted.
[241.42 --> 241.82]  Firefox knew what I wanted.
[241.82 --> 242.74]  And gave it to you.
[242.92 --> 243.48]  And gave it to me.
[245.10 --> 247.74]  Oh, what I don't want is to watch my own stream.
[248.24 --> 251.02]  Although what I do want is to watch my own ad.
[251.34 --> 251.70]  Yep.
[252.12 --> 253.56]  Which helps my own stream.
[253.56 --> 259.22]  Because we have, out of 2,244 people watching, we have 2,200 people that have ad block.
[261.72 --> 263.98]  Oh, ad block.
[264.76 --> 265.64]  Oh, man.
[265.64 --> 267.74]  So, lolz.
[267.98 --> 268.56]  It's okay.
[268.72 --> 270.78]  I mean, uh...
[270.78 --> 271.14]  Yeah.
[272.82 --> 274.00]  Someone said, please no gaming.
[274.12 --> 275.38]  I want to play games, man.
[275.42 --> 276.14]  Please no gaming.
[276.20 --> 276.82]  What are we going to do?
[276.86 --> 278.68]  We could just sit here, I guess.
[278.68 --> 281.62]  But instead, we're going to find a game to play.
[281.62 --> 281.98]  No.
[282.44 --> 283.00]  All right.
[283.12 --> 284.96]  Let's see if that monitor turns on.
[285.08 --> 286.78]  I'm going to go...
[286.78 --> 288.18]  You could get my sandwich.
[288.74 --> 289.22]  Oh, yeah.
[289.28 --> 290.82]  I'm going to get your sandwich when I grab blueberries.
[290.90 --> 292.68]  You can tell who wears the pants around here, right?
[293.48 --> 294.14]  Yeah, literally.
[294.28 --> 294.92]  Because I'm wearing shorts.
[295.92 --> 296.62]  Hey-o!
[296.62 --> 298.20]  Ultimate joke.
[298.32 --> 298.48]  See?
[298.56 --> 299.30]  I'm wearing pants.
[299.98 --> 300.86]  Ultimate joke.
[301.06 --> 301.88]  Ultimate joke.
[302.20 --> 302.68]  That's...
[302.68 --> 303.26]  That's like...
[303.26 --> 303.72]  That's like...
[303.72 --> 305.32]  You should make a show called Ultimate Joke.
[305.40 --> 306.22]  Ultimate joke?
[306.52 --> 308.36]  And it's just like my bad humor?
[308.58 --> 308.84]  Yeah.
[308.96 --> 310.80]  What was that joke I told earlier today?
[310.92 --> 311.54]  I'm trying to remember.
[312.30 --> 312.82]  It was...
[312.82 --> 313.32]  Ah, yes.
[313.42 --> 313.60]  Wait.
[314.02 --> 316.92]  What did the director say to the crappy camera operator?
[317.04 --> 317.32]  Oh, yeah.
[317.34 --> 322.62]  And it had nothing to do with this, but I happened to be overseeing B-roll shooting some footage
[322.62 --> 323.78]  of a computer.
[325.96 --> 327.82]  Gee, that didn't pan out very well.
[330.00 --> 334.54]  Seriously, if you just stand in front of a camera and seriously, like, try to sit down
[334.54 --> 337.32]  and be very serious and hold jokes like that, I think that could work.
[337.54 --> 338.42]  You think that could work?
[338.42 --> 340.52]  That could work to alienate our entire audience.
[340.52 --> 342.56]  And you come up with these crap jokes.
[342.56 --> 344.14]  What do you mean crap jokes?
[344.32 --> 344.82]  You know what?
[344.98 --> 346.58]  You laugh at them, smart guy.
[346.96 --> 348.92]  Because they're hilariously terrible.
[349.34 --> 350.68]  They can't even hear you.
[350.94 --> 352.06]  I bet you they can.
[352.12 --> 354.46]  Because they're too busy with me wearing the pants.
[355.00 --> 355.46]  Ha ha.
[357.44 --> 358.24]  Why...
[358.24 --> 360.30]  Why is this not working?
[360.96 --> 361.60]  I don't know, man.
[362.68 --> 363.00]  Why?
[364.10 --> 366.34]  Why are there only two monitors detected?
[366.72 --> 367.76]  What is it supposed to be plugged into?
[367.76 --> 368.34]  Hold on.
[368.38 --> 368.58]  No, no.
[368.64 --> 369.78]  I think the problem is...
[369.78 --> 370.02]  Okay.
[370.24 --> 372.52]  Show desktop only on two.
[373.28 --> 373.90]  Let's try this.
[373.98 --> 375.30]  You guys changed everything.
[375.92 --> 376.90]  No, we didn't change that.
[377.02 --> 378.34]  It was supposed to be, like...
[378.34 --> 378.90]  Okay, so this is...
[378.90 --> 380.28]  This was working when we left.
[380.36 --> 381.02]  This was working?
[381.08 --> 381.24]  Yeah.
[381.88 --> 382.22]  Okay.
[382.86 --> 383.22]  Okay.
[384.02 --> 385.82]  Because there's, like, uh...
[385.82 --> 390.20]  Okay, because the capture card is not detecting anything right now.
[390.20 --> 391.06]  Is it plugged into the other one?
[391.28 --> 391.82]  Try it.
[392.02 --> 393.54]  It should be plugged into the Avermedia.
[393.96 --> 394.86]  Which one's the Avermedia?
[395.06 --> 395.64]  The bottom one.
[395.74 --> 395.90]  Yeah.
[396.04 --> 396.54]  It's plugged in.
[396.58 --> 397.86]  Maybe just make sure it's snug.
[401.56 --> 402.30]  Just pull it out.
[402.36 --> 402.90]  Put it back in.
[403.52 --> 404.22]  Yeah, do it again.
[405.50 --> 406.50]  Just pull it out again.
[406.76 --> 407.44]  Put it back in again.
[407.44 --> 409.44]  Awesome.
[412.00 --> 413.32]  This is so weird.
[413.44 --> 414.74]  Why isn't this working?
[417.20 --> 418.14]  Okay, cool.
[418.14 --> 428.00]  So we're trying to play games, but apparently that's a total disaster, and it just isn't going to work at all.
[428.52 --> 431.50]  Apparently I'm still streaming from my own, uh...
[431.50 --> 439.96]  You know, it's funny, because my entire job is to, you know, do tech tips.
[439.96 --> 450.40]  And honestly, like, for the sake of even, for the sake of even, like, efficiently talking about the content...
[450.40 --> 451.86]  I almost just sat on the sandwich.
[452.02 --> 453.20]  I didn't even realize this was here.
[453.60 --> 461.18]  For the sake of, like, trying to talk about it in an expedient way, I don't think I could even cover the troubleshooting steps that go into some of this hardware.
[461.74 --> 467.12]  Like, honestly, something like these Blackmagic Intensity Pro capture cards?
[468.38 --> 468.78]  Unbelievable.
[468.78 --> 469.22]  Unbelievable.
[469.52 --> 470.36]  Just unbelievable.
[470.80 --> 471.84]  Uh, Razer Coms.
[471.88 --> 477.30]  Yeah, we need to get, like, a waiting room and, like, a live calling thing going on.
[477.38 --> 480.74]  I hope Slick is going to help us figure that out pretty quickly here.
[481.00 --> 492.30]  In the meantime, I'm trying to figure out how the devil I'm supposed to output to this capture card, which apparently just doesn't think that I should be allowed to output to it anymore.
[492.48 --> 494.58]  So I'm going to restart this computer and see what happens.
[494.58 --> 503.58]  But, um, yeah, my brilliant plan is to play some more NHL Hockey 93 because...
[503.58 --> 507.66]  That's what I want to do.
[508.16 --> 508.60]  Oh!
[508.60 --> 515.60]  I guess you could say troubleshooting the Blackmagic Intensity is...
[516.92 --> 517.68]  Intense.
[517.68 --> 520.28]  Also, hold on, hold on.
[520.44 --> 521.34]  I got something to add to that.
[521.42 --> 522.38]  That's from one of the Twitch viewers.
[523.94 --> 528.68]  You could also say that to get it to work, it required some Blackmagic.
[528.68 --> 530.82]  And you had to be pro.
[531.42 --> 532.76]  Wow, now we've done the whole thing.
[532.84 --> 533.10]  Awesome.
[533.94 --> 534.40]  Love it.
[534.86 --> 537.36]  Okay, we have something really exciting coming up.
[538.18 --> 549.40]  So Kingston, this drive right here, is sponsoring us to do a live meetup that is going to be the coolest Linus Tech Tips event ever.
[549.40 --> 552.30]  It's going to be sometime in the next two to three weeks.
[553.32 --> 556.94]  And it's basically going to be like a mini track meet.
[557.24 --> 558.50]  Except there's only one event.
[559.00 --> 561.48]  We're going to have the entire Linus Media Group crew there.
[561.76 --> 563.04]  So we're going to be filming it.
[563.68 --> 568.54]  For participating, you get entered in a draw to win a USB drive.
[568.54 --> 581.12]  To participate, we are requiring that at least most of the participants have a USB 3 equipped notebook or tablet running something like Windows 7 or Windows 8.
[581.12 --> 598.76]  And basically what it's going to be is a real world demonstration of the difference in performance between USB 2, USB 3, and a very high performance USB 3 drive.
[599.16 --> 599.60]  What the devil?
[599.70 --> 600.20]  Oh, wow.
[600.48 --> 600.90]  Blueberries.
[602.28 --> 602.68]  Nice.
[603.24 --> 603.54]  Whatever.
[603.54 --> 611.38]  And so pretty much, yeah, it's going to be a blast.
[612.20 --> 614.92]  And people are asking if it's going to be in Ontario.
[615.20 --> 615.44]  No.
[615.94 --> 616.98]  Are we going to do it in Ontario?
[617.24 --> 617.52]  No.
[618.02 --> 618.94]  What kind of question is that?
[618.96 --> 619.82]  We don't live in Ontario.
[619.96 --> 625.64]  We're not going to pack all of ourselves up to find someone to participate in like a weird fake track meet.
[626.56 --> 629.40]  But yeah, it is going to be absolutely fantastic.
[629.40 --> 634.82]  And we are definitely going to be wanting community involvement in this.
[635.44 --> 637.88]  And yeah, really exciting.
[638.00 --> 640.18]  And huge thanks to Kingston for making this happen.
[641.20 --> 645.78]  They also want to turn it into kind of like a promotional video spot.
[645.90 --> 647.84]  So that's part of why Linus Media Group is involved.
[648.10 --> 653.26]  So we're going to create like a 30-second cut of like sort of some of the more dramatic moments.
[653.48 --> 655.68]  Like as a teaser for the actual video.
[655.68 --> 662.44]  We'd love for people to come out and participate who are willing to sit on camera and talk about sort of that critical moment in the race.
[662.54 --> 669.60]  But basically it's going to be a relay race where instead of passing a baton, the participants are going to pass a file.
[670.86 --> 675.32]  Each of the teams will be equipped with a different class of USB drive.
[675.32 --> 682.20]  So it will serve, if nothing else, as a neat illustration of how much more quickly you could get things done if you're transferring files.
[682.46 --> 687.96]  If you have USB 2, USB 3, or USB 3 with a very fast solution such as a Kingston HyperX drive.
[689.50 --> 690.68]  So I think that's going to be really cool.
[691.00 --> 691.20]  Yeah.
[691.30 --> 692.52]  And I hope you guys are excited.
[692.72 --> 693.94]  People are like, can it be in Detroit?
[694.18 --> 697.34]  We could buy Detroit as part of our budget from Kingston.
[697.84 --> 699.00]  And then hold it there.
[699.60 --> 700.18]  You know what?
[700.22 --> 703.38]  That would be unfortunate because we could not support that bet.
[703.38 --> 707.14]  That could actually not happen.
[707.38 --> 712.54]  We could buy Detroit and then we would just be broke after the first check comes in.
[712.64 --> 713.62]  You know what I think it is?
[713.70 --> 718.82]  I think it's because that particular display doesn't support 4x3 or something.
[719.22 --> 720.50]  Or was it working before?
[720.72 --> 721.66]  It was totally working.
[721.66 --> 722.96]  When I left, this was all working.
[723.50 --> 725.40]  This was all working when you left.
[725.64 --> 725.86]  Yep.
[727.20 --> 727.64]  Huh.
[727.78 --> 729.48]  Because I just rebooted and that did nothing.
[730.92 --> 731.82]  I don't know, man.
[731.82 --> 737.22]  Well, while you talk about that, I drove my car this morning.
[737.88 --> 739.24]  Oh, I have a video clip.
[739.74 --> 740.18]  Do you?
[740.50 --> 741.46]  Does this...
[741.46 --> 742.44]  How can you show that?
[742.72 --> 743.38]  I don't know.
[743.48 --> 746.36]  I don't know if this has that weird combo connector.
[746.68 --> 746.70]  Oh.
[747.10 --> 747.80]  I don't think so.
[748.06 --> 749.38]  If I do this, is it just going to break it?
[749.52 --> 749.74]  Probably.
[750.28 --> 752.30]  Here, you could transfer the file though.
[752.74 --> 753.16]  Sure.
[753.56 --> 755.48]  If you transfer it to the Stream PC.
[755.92 --> 757.08]  There's a cable in my backpack.
[757.20 --> 758.76]  Is it below 25 megabytes?
[758.76 --> 758.84]  Yes.
[759.26 --> 759.80]  Alright, cool.
[762.18 --> 762.62]  Here you go.
[762.82 --> 765.32]  It's plugged into my battery backup thing.
[765.86 --> 766.70]  So just, yeah.
[766.82 --> 768.68]  Throw it on the Stream PC and then we'll just play back a file.
[768.80 --> 769.16]  But, okay.
[769.20 --> 772.60]  You can tell them the story in the meantime while I try to figure out how to get the game stream working.
[772.60 --> 774.56]  Um, yeah.
[774.70 --> 778.46]  So I was driving to NCX this morning so that we could film.
[779.20 --> 784.26]  And right before a bridge, I have nowhere that I can possibly go at this point.
[784.50 --> 786.96]  Right before a bridge, I feel it lurch.
[787.52 --> 789.62]  Like, pretty heavily lurch.
[789.70 --> 791.24]  Like, I felt my car lurch before.
[791.74 --> 793.06]  But this was like...
[793.06 --> 794.68]  Because it's a sunburn and it sucks.
[794.68 --> 796.34]  I, like, this...
[796.34 --> 799.38]  The pedal was completely non-functional for a second or two.
[799.50 --> 799.80]  While I...
[799.80 --> 801.68]  And I was like, that's...
[802.54 --> 804.58]  Really not good.
[804.88 --> 808.06]  And, like, my check engine light flashed once and then disappeared.
[808.76 --> 810.42]  And I was like, okay.
[810.98 --> 812.90]  Maybe it was an isolated thing.
[813.64 --> 815.72]  Not like I can do anything about it right now.
[815.84 --> 817.52]  Let's get over this freaking bridge.
[817.92 --> 819.54]  So that at least I have somewhere to go.
[820.34 --> 822.08]  Because at this point in time, I have nowhere to go.
[822.92 --> 824.04]  Start climbing the bridge.
[824.08 --> 825.12]  And it's a pretty big bridge.
[825.76 --> 829.34]  And I get, like, halfway up the initial incline.
[829.56 --> 831.54]  You know that they're just, like, looking at your crotch, right?
[831.62 --> 831.90]  Oh, yeah.
[832.06 --> 832.46]  That's fine.
[832.56 --> 833.16]  It's a happy party.
[833.26 --> 833.78]  I don't really care.
[834.56 --> 836.06]  The blacks are crushed anyway.
[836.18 --> 837.16]  So you probably can't see anything.
[838.78 --> 839.22]  Um...
[839.22 --> 839.70]  Yeah.
[839.86 --> 842.06]  So I'm halfway up the initial incline.
[842.40 --> 843.48]  And it lurches again.
[844.18 --> 847.08]  And I'm like, oh, this is so not good.
[847.22 --> 849.22]  Two in a row in, like, that short of a span.
[849.22 --> 851.50]  This is actually possibly going to be a problem.
[852.04 --> 853.98]  So I try to put a little bit more power into it.
[854.02 --> 856.02]  To, like, throw myself over the crest of the hill.
[856.08 --> 857.30]  So I can get the heck out of the way.
[857.72 --> 861.10]  And the second I throw a little bit more power into it, I'm already not going fast.
[861.20 --> 862.46]  Because I'm worried about it lurching.
[863.26 --> 863.78]  Um...
[863.78 --> 866.94]  I feel two big more lurches.
[867.00 --> 868.52]  Which kind of throw me forward a little bit.
[868.58 --> 870.72]  Because it's lurching really hard at this point.
[871.00 --> 873.12]  I have absolutely no power in my pedal.
[874.12 --> 874.72]  And...
[874.72 --> 875.62]  Yep.
[875.70 --> 876.20]  That was it.
[876.20 --> 883.44]  So on this huge bridge in rush hour traffic, my car in the very middle lane stopped moving.
[884.66 --> 886.68]  That was messed up.
[886.74 --> 887.78]  So I flipped my hood open.
[888.44 --> 889.38]  Um...
[889.38 --> 891.34]  And then stood in my convertible.
[891.56 --> 894.18]  Stood up inside my convertible and was directing traffic.
[894.30 --> 895.98]  Telling people to stop so other people could get in.
[896.02 --> 897.10]  And, like, getting people around me.
[897.46 --> 898.16]  It was ridiculous.
[899.24 --> 900.90]  It was absolutely ridiculous.
[900.90 --> 903.84]  So my car is potentially dead.
[904.26 --> 906.64]  But then the thing that's inside of it might be...
[906.64 --> 907.36]  Um...
[907.36 --> 910.54]  Might be under warranty.
[911.20 --> 911.64]  So...
[911.64 --> 913.18]  Who knows at this point.
[913.50 --> 915.70]  I may or may not have the same car very soon.
[915.70 --> 918.10]  Uh...
[918.10 --> 919.98]  You should probably try and transfer that file.
[920.12 --> 920.70]  It was still...
[922.24 --> 923.20]  Oh, is it still detecting?
[923.34 --> 923.56]  Yeah.
[923.70 --> 925.32]  Oh, it probably has to install, like...
[925.32 --> 925.54]  Yeah.
[925.66 --> 926.78]  Driver or some nonsense.
[927.52 --> 928.74]  Is it below 25 megabytes?
[928.84 --> 929.54]  Can I just email it?
[929.72 --> 930.40]  I have no idea.
[930.74 --> 931.40]  Way easier.
[931.62 --> 932.94]  I don't know how big the file is.
[933.02 --> 933.80]  I think it just detected.
[934.26 --> 936.00]  A bunch of people are asking me why I'm sitting on top of the couch.
[936.10 --> 937.12]  It's a lot more comfortable.
[937.34 --> 938.44]  And it's insanely hot in here.
[938.44 --> 939.74]  It's really hot in here.
[939.74 --> 940.96]  It's really crazy hot in here.
[941.06 --> 944.90]  So sitting on the couch is, like, not good right now.
[945.48 --> 946.50]  I have to sit on the couch.
[946.66 --> 947.90]  And I have a laptop in my lap.
[947.96 --> 951.30]  Speaking of laptops in my lap, we checked out the Razer Blade this week.
[951.66 --> 953.74]  So, other than two complaints...
[954.98 --> 955.74]  Mmm...
[956.40 --> 959.06]  It might be the most perfect laptop I've ever encountered.
[959.36 --> 961.70]  You said that about this one, and I completely disagree.
[961.96 --> 965.66]  But the things that you said it has fixed are the things that I didn't like.
[965.96 --> 966.78]  So, back to the Blade.
[967.60 --> 968.14]  Oh, Blade.
[968.40 --> 968.62]  Never mind.
[968.62 --> 969.28]  Yeah, this is the Blade.
[969.28 --> 969.88]  My bad.
[970.30 --> 977.32]  So, number one is I measured the bottom of the notebook at 60 degrees while gaming.
[978.40 --> 983.98]  So, to me, like, as warm as this is on my lap right now, 60 degrees is pretty friggin' hot.
[984.16 --> 985.04]  Holy crap.
[985.12 --> 986.86]  So, remember I borrowed your temp probe?
[987.28 --> 987.60]  Yeah.
[987.74 --> 991.62]  So, I was taking temperatures at various parts of the chassis while the game was running.
[991.78 --> 996.22]  Because I've seen other reviewers talk about how it's hot or whatever, but I wanted to quantify it.
[996.22 --> 1000.64]  So, I took the temperature of the Q key, which is near your WASD.
[1001.30 --> 1004.26]  I took the temperature of the palm rest, and I took the temperature of the underside.
[1004.26 --> 1007.50]  Basically, that thing is not a laptop.
[1008.08 --> 1009.14]  It is a notebook.
[1009.84 --> 1010.64]  Not a laptop.
[1011.14 --> 1012.30]  You don't put it on your laptop.
[1012.30 --> 1013.30]  Yeah.
[1013.30 --> 1014.30]  That's fine, though.
[1014.30 --> 1015.00]  That's fine, though.
[1015.00 --> 1016.04]  If you're gaming, anyway.
[1016.04 --> 1016.26]  Yeah.
[1016.26 --> 1016.72]  Yeah.
[1016.72 --> 1016.78]  Yeah.
[1016.78 --> 1019.94]  Because when you're not gaming, it's probably not all that hot, right?
[1019.94 --> 1022.10]  Well, then it's fine, because Optimus turns off the GPU.
[1022.10 --> 1023.40]  And then the other thing is the display.
[1023.40 --> 1024.40]  Yeah.
[1024.40 --> 1026.84]  It has one of the worst TN panels I've ever seen.
[1027.04 --> 1027.20]  Right.
[1027.28 --> 1031.14]  So, these are, for people that might be confused, when I was talking earlier, when I said I completely
[1031.14 --> 1034.72]  disagree, I was talking about a completely different laptop, because I forgot that he's
[1034.72 --> 1035.42]  talking about Razer Blade.
[1035.50 --> 1036.34]  I haven't even seen it.
[1038.92 --> 1039.28]  Okay.
[1039.68 --> 1041.44]  Where does your phone store its videos?
[1041.90 --> 1042.90]  It went under DCIM.
[1043.32 --> 1045.12]  Oh, it's like the stupidest thing ever.
[1045.38 --> 1045.58]  Yeah.
[1045.58 --> 1049.60]  It might be in, like, 100 media, or, like, camera, or something.
[1049.74 --> 1051.00]  Mine stores it just under camera.
[1051.36 --> 1052.56]  Apparently it's in 100 media.
[1052.78 --> 1056.22]  I'm going to go get another HDMI cable, because I'm thinking maybe that's the problem here.
[1056.86 --> 1057.58]  Oh, there's one.
[1057.70 --> 1059.24]  Oh, why does people do this?
[1059.48 --> 1061.56]  It's, like, tied around the camera.
[1062.58 --> 1065.50]  It's because it doesn't, like, flop around and do crazy things.
[1065.50 --> 1067.30]  Okay, I understand why he does it, smart guy.
[1067.62 --> 1068.10]  What?
[1069.10 --> 1070.36]  Why does he do this?
[1070.82 --> 1073.38]  I mean, I completely understand and know why he does this.
[1073.38 --> 1075.48]  We, uh, we got new HDMI cables on order.
[1076.18 --> 1081.34]  So we're getting, um, we're getting, like, one and a half foot and, like, really, really
[1081.34 --> 1083.60]  short length so that we don't really have to do this nonsense.
[1083.70 --> 1084.66]  Yeah, that'll be nice, actually.
[1084.92 --> 1085.78]  Yeah, that'll be really nice.
[1085.88 --> 1088.76]  You can even cable manage it to the side of the camera so you don't really have to do
[1088.76 --> 1089.54]  anything with it ever.
[1089.66 --> 1091.04]  Yeah, that's going to be awesome.
[1091.84 --> 1094.30]  So I wonder if it's just a dead HDMI cable.
[1094.30 --> 1095.50]  This is annoying.
[1095.98 --> 1097.90]  I really wish you guys hadn't touched this, though.
[1098.32 --> 1100.92]  I don't know if I can make that any more clear than I already have.
[1100.92 --> 1102.26]  We didn't touch back there.
[1102.50 --> 1104.00]  It was working when we left.
[1104.30 --> 1105.56]  I didn't touch back there.
[1106.18 --> 1107.90]  Oh, so that makes the touching okay?
[1109.18 --> 1110.64]  I mean, if they're okay with it.
[1114.24 --> 1114.68]  Alright.
[1115.20 --> 1118.60]  Let's see if, uh, let's see if it's detecting our other monitor now.
[1118.60 --> 1125.86]  Because it seems to be just, like, yeah, not interested in knowing what's going on right
[1125.86 --> 1126.04]  now.
[1126.04 --> 1126.60]  Alright.
[1126.60 --> 1127.60]  Alright.
[1127.60 --> 1130.52]  So let's try changing resolution just for, you know what?
[1130.52 --> 1131.88]  Let's do, let's extend.
[1133.26 --> 1134.72]  Let's extend displays.
[1135.08 --> 1139.04]  See, this is the kind of, like, diagnosis that usually goes on behind the scenes, but
[1139.04 --> 1146.78]  I've just given up on any kind of, you know, any kind of attempt at professionalism on the
[1146.78 --> 1148.88]  after party because I think it's just a lost cause.
[1150.14 --> 1151.96]  Display device on VGA?
[1152.64 --> 1154.24]  What VGA display device?
[1154.36 --> 1155.98]  Like, is this laptop just broken or what?
[1155.98 --> 1157.44]  I don't know, man.
[1158.30 --> 1159.38]  That's kind of crazy, though.
[1159.58 --> 1160.82]  I don't know what to do right now.
[1162.08 --> 1164.26]  Is it in the right port on the AVerMedia card?
[1164.58 --> 1166.44]  We could just game on the stream PC.
[1166.98 --> 1168.08]  Is there any reason that wouldn't work?
[1168.96 --> 1170.54]  No, we don't have anything on there, but...
[1170.54 --> 1171.00]  Yeah, that's okay.
[1171.10 --> 1172.48]  I can, uh, I can transfer it.
[1172.92 --> 1174.22]  I dust it off, I mean.
[1176.18 --> 1176.94]  Yeah, that's...
[1176.94 --> 1178.12]  I don't know why that wouldn't work.
[1178.30 --> 1178.56]  Okay.
[1178.84 --> 1179.48]  Let me just, uh...
[1179.48 --> 1182.42]  Because the reason why the laptop came around was because we had to do it in the other room,
[1182.48 --> 1182.66]  right?
[1183.68 --> 1185.12]  We always have to do it in the other room.
[1185.24 --> 1186.00]  We don't want people to see.
[1189.06 --> 1189.84]  Oh my goodness.
[1191.70 --> 1192.30]  Or do we?
[1192.94 --> 1197.68]  I mean, I guess if we're going to stream it online, we better be sort of okay with the consequences.
[1198.08 --> 1205.42]  Speaking of which, um, this is sort of, this is sort of related to one of the things we talked about earlier.
[1205.50 --> 1211.66]  How do you feel about your online identity becoming pretty close to your real world identity?
[1211.84 --> 1212.86]  I don't know.
[1213.20 --> 1215.94]  Um, I don't actually really care.
[1215.94 --> 1220.80]  And I found, I decided to go through and start prioritizing because I didn't have a choice after CES.
[1221.20 --> 1221.64]  Right.
[1221.82 --> 1222.32]  It was done.
[1222.94 --> 1227.60]  Um, none of us really kind of thought about the fact that my full name
[1227.60 --> 1230.72]  was very blatantly on the thing hanging around my neck.
[1230.86 --> 1232.60]  Which you needed to get in and out of the show.
[1232.72 --> 1234.16]  Which I needed to get in and out of the show.
[1234.20 --> 1236.54]  And getting in and out of things is kind of, you know, important.
[1238.48 --> 1240.26]  Um, so...
[1240.26 --> 1245.46]  I thought about it and I'm like, okay, my full name, probably fine.
[1246.18 --> 1247.18]  It's over anyways.
[1247.46 --> 1249.62]  I'm going to have to find a way to deal with it.
[1249.74 --> 1252.76]  It's not really that big of a deal, I guess.
[1253.00 --> 1257.08]  But I had to decide what things do I want to keep private at this point.
[1257.08 --> 1261.56]  So, I went through everything and thought about it and was like, okay, I don't have a Facebook
[1261.56 --> 1262.06]  anyways.
[1263.12 --> 1264.66]  I don't really use Twitter.
[1264.76 --> 1267.80]  I have some old Twitter account that I haven't logged into in like two years or something.
[1268.38 --> 1270.44]  So that doesn't really matter in either way.
[1270.46 --> 1271.54]  I don't use Google+.
[1271.54 --> 1273.54]  I don't use all these different things.
[1273.78 --> 1275.14]  So that wasn't really a problem.
[1275.40 --> 1276.42]  I have my forum account.
[1277.16 --> 1280.36]  And then all my gamer tags are not out there.
[1282.18 --> 1283.22]  So it didn't really matter.
[1283.22 --> 1286.82]  I actually haven't had any problems with it at all.
[1288.00 --> 1289.90]  And would it bother you if people knew, like, your family?
[1290.52 --> 1290.80]  Yes.
[1291.82 --> 1292.84]  And to a point they do.
[1292.92 --> 1293.48]  They know my brother.
[1293.98 --> 1294.26]  Right.
[1294.44 --> 1295.02]  And like, they know...
[1295.02 --> 1296.94]  But your brother's more of a public figure anyway.
[1297.20 --> 1298.02]  My brother is a public figure.
[1298.52 --> 1300.22]  Um, but like...
[1301.00 --> 1302.24]  My mom.
[1302.70 --> 1303.60]  She's come on the stream.
[1303.76 --> 1304.80]  She's commented on the stream.
[1305.38 --> 1311.84]  If anyone figures out her full name and ever tries to like contact her or harass her in any
[1311.84 --> 1313.48]  way, that's not okay.
[1314.04 --> 1314.38]  Right.
[1316.52 --> 1317.46]  That's just...
[1317.46 --> 1318.06]  I can't...
[1318.06 --> 1319.02]  I can't deal with that.
[1320.28 --> 1320.94]  I don't know.
[1321.12 --> 1325.30]  Because it's okay for me to sit up here and say it's a big deal.
[1325.46 --> 1326.44]  Or it's not a big deal.
[1326.80 --> 1329.06]  But that's myself accepting that.
[1329.14 --> 1332.12]  That's not myself accepting that for other people.
[1332.12 --> 1336.66]  And I can't sit up here and say it's okay for other people that I know.
[1336.66 --> 1339.36]  I mean, to a certain extent.
[1340.34 --> 1340.74]  It's...
[1340.74 --> 1341.06]  Okay.
[1341.38 --> 1343.42]  I think harassment's very avoidable.
[1343.64 --> 1345.54]  And people don't necessarily need to do that.
[1345.60 --> 1347.24]  But people have recognized my mom.
[1348.46 --> 1352.38]  Like, she's had students in her class be like, you're Linus' mom?
[1353.48 --> 1354.58]  And she's been like, what?
[1354.72 --> 1358.12]  As long as it's not really a problem.
[1358.32 --> 1360.94]  Like, as long as they're not jerks about it, I think it's probably fine.
[1361.06 --> 1361.30]  Right.
[1361.30 --> 1363.66]  But if people are jerks...
[1363.66 --> 1365.56]  But if it's like, why Paul123, then...
[1365.56 --> 1368.12]  If he somehow contacts my mom?
[1368.26 --> 1369.56]  You probably shouldn't even have brought that up.
[1370.06 --> 1374.14]  Speaking of which, he has a new prediction for how long it's going to take Lenny to be a group to go out of business.
[1374.20 --> 1374.90]  How long is that?
[1375.62 --> 1376.76]  This time next year.
[1377.38 --> 1377.70]  Oh.
[1378.16 --> 1381.94]  So at first it was, I think, like weeks.
[1382.08 --> 1383.02]  Looks like you're working now, by the way.
[1383.02 --> 1384.04]  Or it was a month, I think.
[1384.82 --> 1387.80]  And then next it was months, and now it's this time next year.
[1387.80 --> 1387.84]  Okay.
[1389.02 --> 1392.86]  So why Paul keeps revising his prediction for how long it's going to take us to go out of business?
[1393.44 --> 1395.16]  You know, if he continues, he'll be right.
[1396.80 --> 1398.20]  Because eventually...
[1398.20 --> 1398.84]  Eventually...
[1398.84 --> 1399.62]  Someone will die.
[1399.80 --> 1400.04]  Yeah.
[1400.14 --> 1400.80]  And...
[1401.60 --> 1410.54]  If he literally never stops revising when the company will end, as long as he keeps his windows fairly small, it'll work.
[1410.90 --> 1411.74]  It'll be fine.
[1411.80 --> 1412.44]  He will be right.
[1413.56 --> 1414.48]  Alright, fair enough.
[1414.48 --> 1416.54]  The video is on the server, actually.
[1416.54 --> 1419.36]  I push it over to the server, under the loop drive.
[1419.64 --> 1419.80]  Oh.
[1419.96 --> 1420.36]  Oh, okay.
[1420.44 --> 1420.62]  Cool.
[1420.84 --> 1421.16]  Hold on.
[1421.24 --> 1422.54]  Let me, uh...
[1422.54 --> 1425.44]  Okay, we're gonna play this video, because it's awesome.
[1426.10 --> 1427.32]  Add media file.
[1428.54 --> 1429.02]  Uh...
[1429.02 --> 1430.96]  You didn't cut paste, did you?
[1432.56 --> 1433.36]  I don't think so.
[1433.48 --> 1433.88]  Okay, cool.
[1434.72 --> 1437.26]  Because I still want that video for my own personal enjoyment.
[1437.38 --> 1439.88]  I don't think I did, and even if I did, you can just pull it off the server.
[1440.02 --> 1441.36]  Uh, where is it?
[1441.40 --> 1441.76]  Slick temp?
[1442.00 --> 1442.60]  No, no, no.
[1443.60 --> 1445.70]  Uh, video 0401.
[1445.70 --> 1446.90]  Oh, here we go, here we go, here we go.
[1446.90 --> 1447.52]  I haven't even seen it.
[1447.52 --> 1454.38]  I don't know if I'm gonna tell Slick I'm recording this video clip, but, uh, basically, this is the gorgeous view.
[1454.46 --> 1455.52]  Everyone is very properly in the...
[1455.52 --> 1458.32]  From the middle of the Alex Freezer Bridge.
[1458.32 --> 1459.10]  ...and we're doing a job at this point.
[1459.10 --> 1460.48]  Look at that.
[1460.56 --> 1464.42]  You can really see out there, and there's this guy with his...
[1464.42 --> 1470.10]  What he claims is awesome and never breaks down Pontiac Sunbird.
[1470.10 --> 1470.30]  Yeah.
[1470.30 --> 1473.68]  So that is what you get for owning a Pontiac.
[1474.36 --> 1475.70]  People mostly think about themselves.
[1475.70 --> 1477.18]  And, uh, attempting to drive it somewhere.
[1477.18 --> 1478.00]  I didn't do it after you were.
[1478.00 --> 1479.86]  Relying on it for really anything.
[1479.86 --> 1485.90]  So I ended up in the middle of this because I'm the one with a, uh, AAA membership.
[1485.90 --> 1490.06]  So, uh, that's why I get to enjoy this experience.
[1490.06 --> 1494.82]  See, this is, this is my vehicle that actually doesn't break down.
[1496.82 --> 1501.46]  And, uh, this is, like, no reliable shame.
[1501.46 --> 1506.38]  You know, do you know how many people you've inconvenienced this morning?
[1506.38 --> 1507.38]  Sorry?
[1507.38 --> 1511.22]  Do you know how many people you've inconvenienced this morning by having a crappy car?
[1511.22 --> 1514.58]  At least I made it pleasurable by pointing them where to go.
[1514.58 --> 1515.58]  Yeah.
[1515.58 --> 1516.58]  See?
[1516.58 --> 1520.46]  Cal Tire doesn't, doesn't think much of that.
[1520.46 --> 1521.58]  No, he raved at me.
[1521.58 --> 1524.58]  It's really nice.
[1524.58 --> 1527.02]  So hopefully the tow truck will be here soon.
[1527.02 --> 1529.90]  I don't know if the tow truck you have, it kind of didn't stop very well.
[1531.46 --> 1534.94]  So there you go, guys.
[1534.94 --> 1541.22]  That was the experience that I, uh, got to enjoy with Slick on the...
[1541.22 --> 1542.22]  So the, the hand-waving thing.
[1542.22 --> 1546.10]  I found if I didn't do that, people would come all the way up to the back of my car,
[1546.10 --> 1550.56]  even though the hood was up, come to a complete stop, and then put their blinker on, and then
[1550.56 --> 1551.56]  try and switch lanes.
[1551.56 --> 1552.56]  Awesome.
[1552.56 --> 1557.54]  If I stood up there and did that, it mostly would divide way before my car, and it was
[1557.54 --> 1559.02]  usually fine.
[1559.02 --> 1562.50]  Slick's car E8 on a bridge, says someone on Twitter.
[1562.50 --> 1563.50]  It basically did.
[1563.50 --> 1564.50]  Yeah, that sounds about right.
[1564.50 --> 1565.50]  I didn't buy the continuous driving DLC.
[1565.50 --> 1568.50]  So on the long commute to work, it was like, no DLC found.
[1568.50 --> 1569.50]  Stop.
[1569.50 --> 1570.50]  It was just really unfortunate.
[1570.50 --> 1571.50]  It was day one DLC, too.
[1571.50 --> 1572.50]  I know, right?
[1572.50 --> 1573.50]  And I just never wanted to pick it up, because I was like, ah, it's going to be the first
[1573.50 --> 1574.50]  thing.
[1574.50 --> 1575.50]  It was just a good thing.
[1575.50 --> 1576.50]  It was a good thing.
[1576.50 --> 1577.50]  I was going to leave him on, and yeah, I don't know.
[1577.50 --> 1578.50]  That's awesome.
[1578.50 --> 1579.50]  But usually I just had to stand up there and point in both directions that weren't the lane
[1579.50 --> 1580.50]  I was in, and it was usually fine.
[1580.50 --> 1584.50]  Slick's car E8 on a bridge, says someone on Twitter.
[1584.50 --> 1585.50]  It basically did.
[1585.50 --> 1586.50]  Yeah, that sounds about right.
[1586.50 --> 1589.50]  I didn't buy the continuous driving DLC.
[1589.50 --> 1590.50]  I didn't buy the DLC.
[1590.50 --> 1593.50]  So on the long commute to work, it was like, no DLC found.
[1593.50 --> 1594.50]  Stop.
[1594.50 --> 1597.50]  It was just really unfortunate.
[1597.50 --> 1598.50]  It was day one DLC, too.
[1598.50 --> 1599.50]  I know, right?
[1599.50 --> 1603.50]  And I just never wanted to pick it up, because I was like, ah, screw day one DLC.
[1603.50 --> 1604.50]  That's how they get you.
[1604.50 --> 1610.50]  Except that your car's a 91, so I don't know how day one you think that the DLC was, but
[1610.50 --> 1614.50]  I think it was less day one than you think it is.
[1614.50 --> 1617.50]  Well, it was, yeah, I don't know.
[1617.50 --> 1620.50]  I think that's where that breaks down.
[1620.50 --> 1625.50]  I feel like swinging at EA, though, so I'm going to pull out another thing.
[1625.50 --> 1628.50]  A bunch of the, what the heck is the name of that company?
[1628.50 --> 1629.50]  Maxis?
[1629.50 --> 1632.50]  A bunch of the Maxis devs quit and formed their own studio.
[1632.50 --> 1633.50]  So like SimCity, the Sims?
[1633.50 --> 1634.50]  Yeah.
[1634.50 --> 1636.50]  SimCity, the Sims 4.
[1636.50 --> 1638.50]  They quit and formed their own studio.
[1638.50 --> 1643.50]  I don't remember what it's called, but they're calling themselves like, ex-triple-a
[1643.50 --> 1644.50]  developer recovers.
[1644.50 --> 1645.50]  Like, recovery, yeah.
[1645.50 --> 1646.50]  Recovery people.
[1646.50 --> 1648.50]  I don't remember what they called it.
[1648.50 --> 1652.50]  Yeah, so that's, yeah, I don't know.
[1652.50 --> 1654.50]  Kind of funny, actually.
[1654.50 --> 1655.50]  I like it.
[1655.50 --> 1658.50]  I think it's hilarious.
[1658.50 --> 1659.50]  I know.
[1659.50 --> 1660.50]  It's so hot.
[1660.50 --> 1661.50]  The upper floor.
[1661.50 --> 1662.50]  It's cool.
[1662.50 --> 1663.50]  It's kind of insane.
[1663.50 --> 1664.50]  Okay, I don't know how well this is going to work.
[1664.50 --> 1665.50]  Before you can capture Gamer Media File, you first need to click inside the window you
[1665.50 --> 1666.50]  wish to capture.
[1666.50 --> 1667.50]  So first click your game.
[1667.50 --> 1668.50]  Okay.
[1668.50 --> 1669.50]  Okay.
[1669.50 --> 1672.50]  I don't know if that's going to work with, like, a Super Nintendo that we dusted off.
[1672.50 --> 1674.50]  And then go back and click this.
[1674.50 --> 1675.50]  Add game.
[1675.50 --> 1676.50]  Nope.
[1676.50 --> 1677.50]  No, no, no, no, no.
[1677.50 --> 1678.50]  Okay.
[1678.50 --> 1683.50]  We could just do, like, add screen region, which is ghetto as balls.
[1683.50 --> 1694.50]  And just let that be what it is.
[1694.50 --> 1695.50]  There's a crop thing, right?
[1695.50 --> 1700.50]  Yeah, I don't know what that's going to do with it, so...
[1700.50 --> 1701.50]  I don't know.
[1701.50 --> 1705.50]  I just let that be what it is.
[1705.50 --> 1707.50]  And there's a crop thing, right?
[1707.50 --> 1711.50]  Yeah, I don't know how to do it into it.
[1711.50 --> 1720.18]  Okay, cropping, there we go. So right... aw yeah. I can't believe I've been using Xplit
[1720.18 --> 1726.00]  this long and I didn't know about the crop. That is just unbelievable to me. So we're
[1726.00 --> 1733.98]  gonna kill this. Oh no, it's not even here yet. So add screen region. Here we go, here
[1733.98 --> 1738.62]  we go, here we go. Boom. Teaching everyone how to use Xplit.
[1738.62 --> 1744.62]  Yeah, we should be streaming this. So you crop that...
[1744.62 --> 1753.62]  Yeah, right there. Crop right... right there. And then hopefully that's somewhat right.
[1753.62 --> 1758.74]  And then hopefully those little icons at the bottom are gonna go away at some point. So
[1758.74 --> 1763.62]  once I'm done troubleshooting this I'll be able to actually remotely pay attention.
[1763.62 --> 1764.62]  Hey, hey, there we go.
[1764.62 --> 1768.62]  Wind speed, we are going deaf doesn't mean anything. What's happening?
[1768.62 --> 1770.62]  We are going deaf? What?
[1770.62 --> 1775.62]  He said we are going deaf three times. I don't know what that... I have no idea what that means.
[1777.62 --> 1781.62]  The game is too loud or something? Oh, the game's loud. Okay.
[1781.62 --> 1788.62]  Uh oh. Now I don't know what to do. It's far too loud. Is the game... I think the game's far too loud?
[1788.62 --> 1799.62]  Hmm. Alright. Config... Well, we used to have all this figured out. Uh oh. My mouse isn't working in the game so...
[1799.62 --> 1806.62]  I don't know how to change it. Because my mouse isn't working. I...
[1806.62 --> 1812.62]  Mouse isn't working at all? Uh, mouse isn't working in game. So what I could potentially do...
[1812.62 --> 1816.62]  Wheeler said thank you. So maybe it's... what?
[1816.62 --> 1819.62]  Yeah, yeah. Because the game's off now. Oh. That makes sense.
[1819.62 --> 1822.62]  Okay, so... Super Nintendo that we're going to see on. That works.
[1824.62 --> 1829.62]  I have no idea. I'm trying to test it and it's not doing anything. So...
[1831.62 --> 1835.62]  Okay. Eeeeeeee. Ehhh. Ehh. Ehh. Ehh. Ehh. Ehh. Ehh.
[1835.62 --> 1844.62]  Also, everyone, members of the forum or not, check out the folding and boik sections of the forum. We have an awesome team. Teams? We have awesome teams.
[1844.62 --> 1845.62]  Awesome teams.
[1846.62 --> 1848.62]  We should take a live caller.
[1851.62 --> 1854.62]  I think the game's working now, so...
[1854.62 --> 1856.62]  I heard the music is back, wait, gone.
[1856.62 --> 1858.62]  What's gone?
[1858.62 --> 1860.62]  Apparently the music is gone.
[1860.62 --> 1862.62]  Oh, I think it's just really, really quiet.
[1862.62 --> 1863.62]  Okay.
[1863.62 --> 1864.62]  Yep.
[1864.62 --> 1865.62]  That's probably a good thing.
[1865.62 --> 1874.62]  Okay, so this is the adapter that you need when you have to... when your SNES gets really dusty.
[1874.62 --> 1877.62]  And then, uh... oh.
[1877.62 --> 1880.62]  Where's that? Are there any available USB ports?
[1882.62 --> 1883.62]  For adapters?
[1884.62 --> 1885.62]  Dust adapters?
[1886.62 --> 1887.62]  Okay.
[1888.62 --> 1890.62]  This got unplugged from my laptop at some point.
[1890.62 --> 1891.62]  Oh, did my laptop die?
[1891.62 --> 1892.62]  I don't know, man.
[1892.62 --> 1893.62]  Oh.
[1893.62 --> 1894.62]  My battery's dead.
[1894.62 --> 1895.62]  That's annoying.
[1895.62 --> 1896.62]  Well...
[1896.62 --> 1899.62]  Sure wish I had the new model.
[1899.62 --> 1900.62]  More battery life.
[1900.62 --> 1902.62]  More Haswell goodness.
[1902.62 --> 1903.62]  Oh.
[1903.62 --> 1904.62]  Right.
[1904.62 --> 1910.62]  This is why we liked using an external PC for this, because now how are we going to manage comms calls?
[1910.62 --> 1911.62]  Must be like alt tab out.
[1911.62 --> 1912.62]  Oh.
[1912.62 --> 1913.62]  Hmm.
[1913.62 --> 1914.62]  I don't know.
[1914.62 --> 1925.62]  I'm at a bit of a loss, because I don't understand what's wrong with that, uh... that there laptop,
[1925.62 --> 1928.62]  that it's not outputting things properly at all.
[1928.62 --> 1929.62]  Okay.
[1929.62 --> 1933.62]  So do you want to figure out how we can get a live caller?
[1933.62 --> 1934.62]  Um...
[1934.62 --> 1936.62]  Chris is talking to me about it right now.
[1936.62 --> 1937.62]  Okay.
[1937.62 --> 1938.62]  Cool.
[1938.62 --> 1939.62]  He apparently has a few.
[1939.62 --> 1940.62]  Cool.
[1940.62 --> 1941.62]  He's ready to go.
[1941.62 --> 1943.62]  He also has a discussion topic of his own.
[1943.62 --> 1946.62]  Alright, so we just open up the live show... or the WAN show here rather.
[1946.62 --> 1947.62]  Yep.
[1947.62 --> 1948.62]  Alright.
[1948.62 --> 1949.62]  Uh...
[1949.62 --> 1950.62]  Chat with group.
[1950.62 --> 1951.62]  There we go.
[1951.62 --> 1952.62]  Boom.
[1952.62 --> 1954.62]  So we're in there with our voice chat.
[1954.62 --> 1959.62]  And my laptop's dead, which is giving me not a whole lot of options right now.
[1959.62 --> 1960.62]  In terms of...
[1960.62 --> 1961.62]  Ugh!
[1961.62 --> 1962.62]  How I wanna...
[1962.62 --> 1963.62]  Why are we taking live callers?
[1963.62 --> 1965.62]  Should we even play games?
[1965.62 --> 1966.62]  Uh...
[1966.62 --> 1967.62]  Maybe not.
[1967.62 --> 1968.62]  Sure.
[1968.62 --> 1969.62]  Let me do that.
[1969.62 --> 1970.62]  We'll just split it up.
[1970.62 --> 1971.62]  Yeah.
[1971.62 --> 1972.62]  Take a live caller to...
[1972.62 --> 1973.62]  I don't know where the...
[1973.62 --> 1974.62]  Oh...
[1974.62 --> 1976.62]  Is that with the VZ?
[1976.62 --> 1977.62]  Ah!
[1977.62 --> 1978.62]  Diesel!
[1978.62 --> 1979.62]  I...
[1979.62 --> 1982.62]  Everyone's just like determined...
[1982.62 --> 1984.62]  Oh wow, I'm not even on the right scene at all.
[1984.62 --> 1985.62]  This is awesome.
[1985.62 --> 1986.62]  Wait.
[1986.62 --> 1987.62]  Hold on.
[1987.62 --> 1988.62]  How do I...
[1988.62 --> 1989.62]  Ah, go back.
[1989.62 --> 1990.62]  There.
[1990.62 --> 1991.62]  That's the right scene.
[1991.62 --> 1992.62]  Oh...
[1992.62 --> 1994.62]  I'm not having a good sort of run of it here.
[1994.62 --> 1996.62]  So this is my power brick.
[1996.62 --> 1999.62]  And this is it not having the cable that should be with it.
[1999.62 --> 2001.62]  I gave it to Diesel earlier today.
[2001.62 --> 2004.62]  I have no idea what he did with it.
[2004.62 --> 2005.62]  So do you wanna take the first live caller?
[2005.62 --> 2006.62]  And I'll go look for my cable.
[2006.62 --> 2007.62]  Sure.
[2007.62 --> 2008.62]  Sure.
[2008.62 --> 2009.62]  Oh, it's here.
[2009.62 --> 2010.62]  Okay.
[2010.62 --> 2012.62]  I was like, I'm not even signed into RazorCon.
[2012.62 --> 2013.62]  What the...
[2013.62 --> 2020.62]  Yeah, it's very confusing because there's like screen region capture over on that other screen.
[2020.62 --> 2023.62]  And then like you see a little like mouse moving around in there.
[2023.62 --> 2024.62]  What?
[2024.62 --> 2025.62]  And then, yep.
[2025.62 --> 2026.62]  I know, I know.
[2026.62 --> 2027.62]  It's not optimally configured.
[2027.62 --> 2029.62]  It was supposed to be configured before the thing.
[2029.62 --> 2033.62]  But Diesel and Slit came in here and we're trying to fix things.
[2033.62 --> 2035.62]  When I left it was exactly the same.
[2035.62 --> 2036.62]  Uh huh.
[2036.62 --> 2037.62]  And it worked.
[2037.62 --> 2039.62]  So I'm calling crap on that.
[2039.62 --> 2040.62]  Mm-hmm.
[2040.62 --> 2041.62]  Mm-hmm.
[2041.62 --> 2045.62]  And I'm finally done my subway.
[2045.62 --> 2046.62]  That's probably good.
[2046.62 --> 2047.62]  Mm-hmm.
[2047.62 --> 2048.62]  Old subway is gross.
[2048.62 --> 2050.62]  Old subway is like the worst thing ever.
[2050.62 --> 2051.62]  So how do I...
[2051.62 --> 2053.62]  New subway is the best thing ever.
[2053.62 --> 2054.62]  Old subway is the opposite.
[2054.62 --> 2059.62]  Is this the street you see?
[2059.62 --> 2060.62]  There we go.
[2060.62 --> 2062.62]  Windspeed, are you there?
[2062.62 --> 2063.62]  Uh, I am.
[2063.62 --> 2064.62]  Alright.
[2064.62 --> 2065.62]  I don't even...
[2065.62 --> 2066.62]  I don't even...
[2066.62 --> 2067.62]  I don't even...
[2067.62 --> 2068.62]  I don't even...
[2068.62 --> 2069.62]  I don't even...
[2069.62 --> 2072.62]  Can the stream hear me though?
[2072.62 --> 2073.62]  Is the question.
[2073.62 --> 2076.62]  I believe so.
[2076.62 --> 2077.62]  You got this?
[2077.62 --> 2078.62]  Stream, can you hear me?
[2078.62 --> 2081.62]  We're trying to make sure the stream can hear me.
[2081.62 --> 2082.62]  Yeah.
[2082.62 --> 2083.62]  Twitch chats screaming at me.
[2083.62 --> 2084.62]  They should be able to.
[2084.62 --> 2086.62]  Because we were using the exact same setup.
[2086.62 --> 2087.62]  We haven't changed it since...
[2087.62 --> 2088.62]  Yeah.
[2088.62 --> 2089.62]  Yeah, no.
[2089.62 --> 2090.62]  It seems to be fine.
[2090.62 --> 2091.62]  Awesome.
[2091.62 --> 2092.62]  Alright, man.
[2092.62 --> 2093.62]  What's up?
[2093.62 --> 2094.62]  Uh, not much.
[2094.62 --> 2096.62]  I have been dragged...
[2096.62 --> 2098.62]  I have been dragged in here by Windsy.
[2098.62 --> 2100.62]  And some other people.
[2100.62 --> 2105.62]  To publicly apologize for scaring you out of the general chat.
[2105.62 --> 2107.62]  I appreciate that, actually.
[2107.62 --> 2109.62]  Did you get scared out of the general chat?
[2109.62 --> 2111.62]  I got very scared of the general chat, actually.
[2111.62 --> 2112.62]  What did they do to you?
[2112.62 --> 2113.62]  I ran away.
[2113.62 --> 2115.62]  Like, actually, like, ran.
[2115.62 --> 2117.62]  Did they ask you to raise your dongers?
[2117.62 --> 2120.62]  I signed out, slammed the laptop closed, and ran downstairs.
[2120.62 --> 2123.62]  Not actually, but I did sign out.
[2123.62 --> 2128.62]  I was gonna say, I probably would have noticed at least two of those three things that you just said that you did.
[2128.62 --> 2129.62]  And I didn't.
[2129.62 --> 2130.62]  Yeah.
[2130.62 --> 2131.62]  Yeah.
[2131.62 --> 2132.62]  No.
[2132.62 --> 2135.62]  We were more joking around than anything.
[2135.62 --> 2136.62]  It's cool, man.
[2136.62 --> 2137.62]  I joined the other one.
[2137.62 --> 2138.62]  And I'm gonna join that one again.
[2138.62 --> 2139.62]  Yeah.
[2139.62 --> 2140.62]  And I'm in the chat right now.
[2140.62 --> 2143.62]  No, not the Twitch chat.
[2143.62 --> 2144.62]  This was a bit ago.
[2144.62 --> 2146.62]  This was like two days ago.
[2146.62 --> 2147.62]  I don't even know what you're talking about.
[2147.62 --> 2148.62]  Yeah.
[2148.62 --> 2149.62]  No.
[2149.62 --> 2150.62]  Yeah.
[2150.62 --> 2153.62]  And it's actually about a picture that someone on the forum drew.
[2153.62 --> 2154.62]  I don't know if we can, I think we can.
[2154.62 --> 2156.62]  I don't think, is it the picture I'm thinking of?
[2156.62 --> 2157.62]  Yeah.
[2157.62 --> 2159.62]  Ooh, I don't think we should talk about that picture.
[2160.62 --> 2161.62]  Yeah, let's not go into that.
[2161.62 --> 2162.62]  Yeah.
[2162.62 --> 2165.62]  I graciously accept the apology.
[2165.62 --> 2166.62]  That's cool, man.
[2166.62 --> 2167.62]  Wasn't needed.
[2167.62 --> 2168.62]  We're all good.
[2168.62 --> 2169.62]  But let's leave the...
[2169.62 --> 2171.62]  Yeah, that picture was like...
[2173.62 --> 2175.62]  Concerning to say the least.
[2175.62 --> 2176.62]  Yeah.
[2176.62 --> 2177.62]  Oh dear.
[2177.62 --> 2186.62]  Okay, well, if we're not gonna play any, like, Twitch platformers, then maybe what we could
[2186.62 --> 2191.62]  do is we could just play on, like, one of the laptops or something.
[2191.62 --> 2192.62]  That's possible.
[2192.62 --> 2194.62]  We should get a better mouse.
[2194.62 --> 2197.62]  Um, actually, yeah, we should really get a better mouse.
[2197.62 --> 2198.62]  Because we could play directly on the computer.
[2198.62 --> 2201.62]  I hate this mouse.
[2201.62 --> 2202.62]  It's super old.
[2202.62 --> 2203.62]  Yeah, well...
[2203.62 --> 2206.62]  Like, super old.
[2206.62 --> 2208.62]  It's called Wheel Mouse.
[2208.62 --> 2210.62]  Is it?
[2210.62 --> 2211.62]  Yeah, really.
[2211.62 --> 2212.62]  That's the model.
[2212.62 --> 2213.62]  Wheel Mouse.
[2213.62 --> 2214.62]  What?
[2214.62 --> 2215.62]  Yeah.
[2215.62 --> 2216.62]  That's so weird.
[2216.62 --> 2217.62]  I know.
[2217.62 --> 2218.62]  It's like it's a superhero.
[2218.62 --> 2221.62]  It doesn't even need, like, a model name.
[2221.62 --> 2227.62]  It's not like the G25X- Supersonic.
[2227.62 --> 2230.62]  It's just the wheel mouse.
[2230.62 --> 2231.62]  Why is it the wheel mouse?
[2231.62 --> 2232.62]  That's so random.
[2232.62 --> 2233.62]  Well, it has a wheel.
[2233.62 --> 2234.62]  Where?
[2234.62 --> 2237.62]  Because back when that mouse was cool, there were three buttons, potentially.
[2237.62 --> 2238.62]  Yeah.
[2238.62 --> 2239.62]  Instead of a scroll wheel.
[2239.62 --> 2241.62]  Or, like, no scroll wheel at all.
[2241.62 --> 2242.62]  Yeah.
[2242.62 --> 2252.62]  I mean, honestly, for me, scroll wheel and then back button were, like, more important than moving from ball to optical.
[2252.62 --> 2256.62]  Scroll wheel to completely change the way I interface with my computer.
[2256.62 --> 2261.62]  If I put a non-scroll wheel mouse in front of you, you would throw it out the window within, like, five minutes.
[2261.62 --> 2262.62]  I even...
[2262.62 --> 2267.62]  One of the main reasons why I refuse to get rid of my G500 is because it has free...
[2267.62 --> 2269.62]  Yeah, it has, like, an uber scroll wheel.
[2269.62 --> 2271.62]  And I use that all the time.
[2271.62 --> 2275.62]  Like, the free spin feature, a lot of people don't use it, but I use it all the time.
[2275.62 --> 2277.62]  Multiple times a day, at least.
[2277.62 --> 2278.62]  I love it.
[2278.62 --> 2279.62]  It's awesome.
[2279.62 --> 2282.62]  Our color's still with us, right?
[2282.62 --> 2283.62]  I think so.
[2283.62 --> 2284.62]  Yep.
[2284.62 --> 2285.62]  Hey-o!
[2285.62 --> 2290.62]  G9X has it, but the switch for it's on the bottom of the mouse.
[2290.62 --> 2293.62]  Yeah, I know, that's ridiculous.
[2293.62 --> 2295.62]  And there's no point in ever using it.
[2295.62 --> 2296.62]  No, it's just the stupidest thing ever.
[2296.62 --> 2298.62]  I can't even believe they did that.
[2298.62 --> 2304.62]  G500, where it's, uh, on the top of the mouse and really easy to press, that makes sense.
[2304.62 --> 2308.62]  It's easy to press, but it's very, uh, like a heavy click.
[2308.62 --> 2310.62]  Like, you have to put a lot of force into it.
[2310.62 --> 2311.62]  Right.
[2311.62 --> 2313.62]  So it's easy to press, but you won't accidentally do it, which is good.
[2313.62 --> 2315.62]  Let's take another live caller, shall we?
[2315.62 --> 2316.62]  Sure.
[2316.62 --> 2322.62]  Um, just while I'm trying to sort the next live caller out, um, I've actually got a discussion topic for you guys.
[2322.62 --> 2330.62]  Um, with all these new, like high speed internet speeds coming out, like Japan's got two gigabit, most of North America's getting like gigabit.
[2330.62 --> 2338.62]  Is it actually really that good of a thing for so many people to have access to super fast internet connections?
[2338.62 --> 2351.62]  Um, because for countries such as New Zealand, Australia, um, parts of Southeast Asia and Europe that have exchanges and like major infrastructure that's lagging.
[2351.62 --> 2356.62]  Is the danger of DDoS that can take out entire countries ISPs.
[2356.62 --> 2366.62]  There was one back in March this year, um, that actually cloudflare, um, helped fend off of 130 gigabits, which nearly took down the entire of Europe's internet.
[2366.62 --> 2373.62]  So are these huge internet connections that can then be turned into botnets really a good thing for the internet?
[2373.62 --> 2377.62]  That is a very, very interesting topic.
[2377.62 --> 2383.62]  He said this to me earlier and I didn't want to tell you cause I wanted to be more spontaneous and I didn't research it cause I wanted to be more spontaneous.
[2383.62 --> 2388.62]  Another thing that's really interesting is Spam House. Spam House got crushed a while ago.
[2388.62 --> 2394.62]  Yeah, Spam House was the target of the 130 gigabit DDoS that cloudflare implemented.
[2394.62 --> 2399.62]  And like when you're targeting something like Spam House, like you're doing more than just taking down a section.
[2399.62 --> 2404.62]  Like you're disabling a huge thing that a lot of people use.
[2404.62 --> 2406.62]  That's fascinating.
[2406.62 --> 2408.62]  And like don't realize they're using, but a lot of people are using it.
[2408.62 --> 2415.62]  Because it's not about, you know, the people with 2 gigabit internet connections being malicious in any way, shape or form.
[2415.62 --> 2425.62]  It's about, I mean, for those of you who don't know, you can be a member of a botnet without even having any awareness of that fact.
[2425.62 --> 2438.62]  In fact, the person managing the botnet who has zombied your computer, it's in their best interest to keep your computer healthy and functioning 100% normally so you never ever notice it.
[2438.62 --> 2442.62]  And you keep running that botnet zombie forever.
[2442.62 --> 2448.62]  So it just sits there, it's laying in wait, and boom.
[2448.62 --> 2458.62]  They turn it on to fake a YouTube view, or to fake a Twitter follower, or to DDoS an entire country potentially.
[2458.62 --> 2459.62]  Yep.
[2459.62 --> 2465.62]  I mean, it's so hard to argue against improving infrastructure.
[2465.62 --> 2478.62]  I mean, that's like saying, you know, we probably shouldn't build faster highways here because those people might drive so fast that they, okay, whatever, the highway analogy breaks down here, but...
[2478.62 --> 2480.62]  Someone in the other part of the planet.
[2480.62 --> 2482.62]  But yeah, I understand what you're saying though at the same time.
[2482.62 --> 2483.62]  But it's...
[2483.62 --> 2493.62]  And like, it's brutal though because, like Winspeed just said, places like Australia where he's, as you can probably tell from, will get owned by this.
[2493.62 --> 2498.62]  And I mean, not even just there, but places in the developing, in the developing world, like...
[2498.62 --> 2500.62]  Will just get stomped out.
[2500.62 --> 2501.62]  Yeah.
[2501.62 --> 2502.62]  Yeah.
[2502.62 --> 2509.62]  So if someone just decides, oh, you know, Ethiopia doesn't need internet today, bye-bye, or doesn't need it for a week.
[2509.62 --> 2517.62]  I mean, you look at the kinds of sustained attacks these days that can take down major websites that have IT infrastructure.
[2517.62 --> 2523.62]  How hard would it be for them to just shut off an entire country for a month?
[2523.62 --> 2527.62]  They'd have to do a lot of things to shut down the country for a month.
[2527.62 --> 2537.62]  I don't know how closely you looked at that article I sent you, but when there was the attack on Spamhouse, they couldn't actually knock the DDoS protection provided by Cloudflare offline.
[2537.62 --> 2544.62]  So instead they started taking out Tier 1 and Tier 2 data providers that provide Cloudflare with the protection.
[2544.62 --> 2545.62]  Yeah.
[2545.62 --> 2546.62]  So...
[2546.62 --> 2549.62]  Actually pretty hardcore.
[2549.62 --> 2553.62]  The thing is, in my mind, um...
[2553.62 --> 2559.62]  This might not be popular vote with Winspeed and Nicole, but there's no way it's gonna slow down.
[2559.62 --> 2560.62]  Nope.
[2560.62 --> 2564.62]  And we're already at the point, in my opinion, where someone can do this.
[2564.62 --> 2565.62]  They just did.
[2565.62 --> 2567.62]  We saw it happen at Spamhouse.
[2567.62 --> 2571.62]  And like, they were rampant for so long.
[2571.62 --> 2576.62]  These guys are out here, it's gonna happen already at the speed we're already at.
[2576.62 --> 2583.62]  I don't think a lot of these people that have the ability to do this, don't already have the means to do this.
[2583.62 --> 2584.62]  Right.
[2584.62 --> 2587.62]  Like, have the ability as in the knowledge and the desire.
[2587.62 --> 2588.62]  Right.
[2588.62 --> 2591.62]  Like, someone who's actually gonna do it, I don't think they can't already do it.
[2591.62 --> 2597.62]  So personally I don't think ramping up internet speeds will really just start crushing everyone.
[2597.62 --> 2601.62]  It'll just make no difference one way or the other? Is that what you think?
[2601.62 --> 2604.62]  I kind of think so, because...
[2604.62 --> 2606.62]  It's gonna be a targeted attack.
[2606.62 --> 2608.62]  I don't think someone's gonna just go, ha ha, screw Australia.
[2608.62 --> 2610.62]  And throw Australia offline.
[2610.62 --> 2614.62]  But, if like before, remember way back when Australia was trying to...
[2614.62 --> 2618.62]  I think the Australian government was trying to censor nudity online or something?
[2618.62 --> 2619.62]  That was awesome.
[2619.62 --> 2621.62]  And people started DDoSing the crap out of them.
[2621.62 --> 2624.62]  Like, that will happen and that will probably be a lot more effective.
[2624.62 --> 2626.62]  They'll probably really bring down those websites.
[2626.62 --> 2629.62]  But you're not gonna stop technological advancement.
[2630.62 --> 2632.62]  It just won't happen.
[2632.62 --> 2633.62]  So...
[2634.62 --> 2638.62]  Someone in the Twitch chat was saying they don't know how to call in, they don't have Razer comms.
[2638.62 --> 2642.62]  So guys, get Razer comms from this bit.ly link right here.
[2642.62 --> 2645.62]  Helps us out a great deal. Thank you very much.
[2645.62 --> 2646.62]  Should we take another caller?
[2646.62 --> 2647.62]  Sure.
[2647.62 --> 2649.62]  Bring it on!
[2649.62 --> 2651.62]  I just saw someone in the Twitch chat say add winspeed36. Do not add winspeed36.
[2651.62 --> 2652.62]  Yeah, I'm ignoring all friend requests, so...
[2652.62 --> 2653.62]  Yeah.
[2653.62 --> 2654.62]  Do it be a...
[2654.62 --> 2655.62]  Hey, I am in by the way.
[2655.62 --> 2656.62]  Hello?
[2656.62 --> 2657.62]  Hello!
[2657.62 --> 2658.62]  Hey guys, it's Steve on PC Budget Solutions again.
[2658.62 --> 2659.62]  Hey.
[2659.62 --> 2660.62]  Hey.
[2660.62 --> 2661.62]  Hey.
[2661.62 --> 2662.62]  Hey.
[2662.62 --> 2663.62]  Hey.
[2663.62 --> 2664.62]  This is actually on behalf of Ghost.
[2664.62 --> 2670.62]  And I'm bringing this to you guys, if you guys read about it. The H220, because of a copyright infringement with the Asetec design, with the all-in-one design with the radiator and the reservoir in the actual radio.
[2670.62 --> 2671.62]  Itself.
[2671.62 --> 2674.62]  They got sued by Asetec and they are no longer allowed to sell it in the United States.
[2674.62 --> 2675.62]  And they said, well, can we buy a license?
[2675.62 --> 2676.62]  And they said they don't offer licenses.
[2676.62 --> 2677.62]  So, I'm not going to be able to sell it.
[2677.62 --> 2678.62]  I'm not going to be able to sell it.
[2678.62 --> 2679.62]  I'm not going to be able to sell it in the United States.
[2679.62 --> 2680.62]  Then...
[2680.62 --> 2682.62]  Well, it's вами.
[2682.62 --> 2684.62]  The H220, theż sucks.
[2684.62 --> 2685.62]  Keep relaxing for that.
[2685.62 --> 2687.62]  If you guys read about it.
[2687.62 --> 2688.62]  Good luck.
[2688.62 --> 2689.62]  Yep.
[2689.62 --> 2690.62]  Well, it's well done with my friend behind it.
[2690.62 --> 2693.62]  I said, are we going to be able to sell it in the United States?
[2693.62 --> 2694.62]  Yeah.
[2694.62 --> 2695.62]  No...
[2695.62 --> 2696.62]  Freund sigma Debyuwe are going to buy.
[2696.62 --> 2697.62]  Okay.
[2697.62 --> 2698.62]  Yes.
[2698.62 --> 2699.62]  We're going to get right now.
[2699.62 --> 2700.62]  And...
[2700.62 --> 2701.62]  Greg...
[2701.62 --> 2702.62]  .
[2702.62 --> 2704.70]  That was very interesting, but I'm sure they might be usingik.
[2704.70 --> 2705.62]  That's a good deal.
[2705.62 --> 2706.62]  Thank you.
[2706.62 --> 2707.62]  Okay.
[2707.64 --> 2709.60]  Greg...
[2709.62 --> 2713.48]  Now, I did hear that Asatech's going after everyone.
[2713.76 --> 2715.32]  I hadn't heard about this yet,
[2715.76 --> 2719.84]  but basically this is Rambus syndrome,
[2720.74 --> 2721.78]  as far as I can tell,
[2722.16 --> 2723.68]  where Asatech's kind of going,
[2723.68 --> 2727.08]  okay, no one wants to work with us cooperatively anymore.
[2729.22 --> 2732.00]  We don't have any brand cachet
[2732.00 --> 2734.62]  or any brand presence with the individual end user.
[2734.82 --> 2738.26]  They tried to sell LCLC as an Asatech product,
[2738.26 --> 2740.36]  and it was a total abysmal failure.
[2740.92 --> 2743.38]  It wasn't until Corsair picked up the LCLC
[2743.38 --> 2745.36]  that that product really got accepted.
[2745.90 --> 2748.74]  So now I think they're just in patent troll mode.
[2749.52 --> 2751.64]  You look at the ongoing battle with Coolit,
[2752.10 --> 2754.34]  and this is just going to be that same thing
[2754.34 --> 2755.44]  over and over and over again.
[2756.24 --> 2757.26]  Well, what's interesting is,
[2757.50 --> 2760.50]  Ghost wants me to ask if, A, you think Asatech's in the wrong,
[2760.92 --> 2763.10]  and, B, we're talking about patent battles before,
[2763.38 --> 2765.56]  and when I used to work in the phone industry back in 08-09,
[2765.56 --> 2767.52]  I remember, oh my god,
[2767.62 --> 2769.20]  Phonescoop.com was our go-to,
[2769.38 --> 2770.38]  the Learn Stuff About Phones,
[2770.66 --> 2772.76]  and the front page was filled with nothing
[2772.76 --> 2774.94]  but patent lawsuits left and right.
[2775.48 --> 2776.36]  I mean, it's kind of,
[2776.46 --> 2778.18]  at some point, it kind of gets out of hand,
[2778.42 --> 2780.58]  and are they just being patent trolls about it?
[2782.72 --> 2784.30]  They're probably not wrong,
[2784.56 --> 2787.66]  because they did invent the category, basically.
[2787.94 --> 2789.86]  And they're attacking the specific things.
[2789.96 --> 2791.54]  They're not saying, oh, you can't build this at all.
[2791.54 --> 2793.84]  They're saying, I think it's the reservoir inside the radiator?
[2794.52 --> 2794.66]  Could be.
[2794.66 --> 2795.08]  Correct, yes.
[2795.08 --> 2796.26]  That's what they're really going after them for?
[2796.32 --> 2798.28]  Yeah, so they're going after them about specific things.
[2798.38 --> 2799.10]  Now, with SwiftTech,
[2799.84 --> 2801.42]  their whole idea is
[2801.42 --> 2803.50]  make it so you can take it apart.
[2803.86 --> 2804.08]  Yeah.
[2804.22 --> 2806.66]  If they somehow make it so that that reservoir
[2806.66 --> 2808.26]  is detachable from the radiator,
[2808.82 --> 2810.76]  which I don't freaking know how you could do that.
[2810.76 --> 2811.28]  I don't know how I would do that.
[2811.28 --> 2813.50]  But if they somehow manage to think of something,
[2813.58 --> 2814.10]  they're SwiftTech,
[2814.84 --> 2816.10]  they might, I don't know.
[2816.18 --> 2818.90]  I mean, I think, is it the iceberg from Cooler Master
[2818.90 --> 2821.26]  that has the reservoir built into the block?
[2821.70 --> 2823.66]  Yeah, it has the pump block and reservoir
[2823.66 --> 2825.06]  all built into the actual unit.
[2825.58 --> 2825.94]  Yeah.
[2826.10 --> 2827.98]  So, like, if you move it around or something,
[2828.06 --> 2829.82]  you can probably dodge this, but...
[2829.82 --> 2830.32]  Who knows?
[2830.36 --> 2831.98]  Maybe Cooler Master patented that, though.
[2832.26 --> 2832.52]  Maybe.
[2833.48 --> 2836.28]  Because they actually also sell the individual block itself,
[2836.40 --> 2837.22]  Cooler Master does.
[2837.22 --> 2838.88]  It's like 90 bucks or something like that
[2838.88 --> 2840.58]  for just the unit itself,
[2840.68 --> 2842.46]  and then you can add your own radiators and stuff.
[2843.62 --> 2844.22]  Yeah, so...
[2845.08 --> 2845.84]  That's a shame.
[2845.90 --> 2846.94]  It's a good thing we already have one.
[2847.44 --> 2847.84]  Lol.
[2848.36 --> 2848.72]  Very true.
[2848.90 --> 2849.32]  Hey, Windspeed,
[2849.38 --> 2850.40]  won't we bring up anything else,
[2850.44 --> 2851.74]  or do we have more callers coming?
[2854.26 --> 2855.46]  I'm still looking for people,
[2855.58 --> 2857.88]  because the rest of the mod team is, like, absent,
[2858.00 --> 2858.66]  except for Whaler,
[2858.78 --> 2860.72]  who's computer does not like comms at the moment.
[2861.64 --> 2862.74]  A lot of them could have been.
[2863.20 --> 2863.56]  Yeah.
[2864.42 --> 2865.62]  So, okay, then,
[2865.62 --> 2866.92]  do you guys mind if I bring up something else?
[2868.58 --> 2870.80]  We have a couple of topics on our own here.
[2871.24 --> 2872.34]  If it's something quick, sure.
[2873.86 --> 2876.08]  Okay, so I asked Slick about this earlier,
[2876.08 --> 2879.48]  and I really want to touch base really quick on CPU binning.
[2880.08 --> 2881.76]  And do you know enough about this, Leonard?
[2883.20 --> 2884.48]  I've heard of it once or twice.
[2884.88 --> 2885.18]  Okay.
[2885.32 --> 2887.44]  Well, I watched the video you did on NCIX.
[2887.98 --> 2889.92]  Is, like, all Ivy Bridge processors,
[2890.04 --> 2893.40]  are they the same piece of silicon from the G2020
[2893.40 --> 2895.64]  to the i7-3770K?
[2896.64 --> 2897.04]  Yes.
[2897.70 --> 2901.22]  Okay, so would it depend strictly on how much,
[2901.44 --> 2903.42]  or how many, I guess, tested passes
[2903.42 --> 2906.24]  when they do their big test with the cores
[2906.24 --> 2908.30]  and how much frequency they can get out of it?
[2909.30 --> 2911.40]  Yeah, it depends on things like the power leakage.
[2911.52 --> 2912.98]  It depends on how much heat it outputs.
[2912.98 --> 2915.96]  It depends on what kind of frequencies it can run at.
[2916.08 --> 2920.22]  And there are some prediction things that Intel can do.
[2920.22 --> 2924.56]  So, for example, when they manufacture a wafer of processors,
[2925.06 --> 2927.10]  generally speaking, the ones toward the center
[2927.10 --> 2929.38]  are of a higher grade or a higher quality,
[2929.60 --> 2932.16]  and those are more likely to end up being something like
[2932.16 --> 2935.48]  a 3770K or 4770K,
[2935.66 --> 2937.60]  whereas out around the very edges,
[2938.10 --> 2940.56]  you're either going to get incomplete chips, actually,
[2940.68 --> 2941.80]  because wafers are round,
[2942.34 --> 2946.22]  or you'll get ones that end up being, you know,
[2946.28 --> 2947.22]  a Pentium or Celeron
[2947.22 --> 2949.56]  or whatever branding they want to attach
[2949.56 --> 2950.76]  to these lower grade chips.
[2951.18 --> 2952.92]  I couldn't completely answer this question,
[2953.04 --> 2954.20]  because I wasn't sure if, like,
[2954.26 --> 2956.86]  maybe Pentium was taken from a certain wafer.
[2957.46 --> 2957.62]  No.
[2957.70 --> 2958.42]  Or if there was any.
[2958.48 --> 2959.92]  I wasn't sure if there was any change at all.
[2959.98 --> 2960.82]  It's a binning process,
[2961.10 --> 2963.62]  and, I mean, this is part of why what Intel has done
[2963.62 --> 2965.20]  is they have begun differentiating,
[2965.32 --> 2968.30]  not just on processing speed,
[2968.58 --> 2971.90]  so they also differentiate on how much cache is enabled.
[2972.28 --> 2973.94]  And a lot of the time these days, come on,
[2974.04 --> 2975.50]  cache ain't complicated anymore
[2975.50 --> 2979.42]  compared to how you used to actually differentiate processors
[2979.42 --> 2981.26]  by the amount of cache that they had
[2981.26 --> 2983.70]  because part of the cache might have been defective.
[2984.04 --> 2986.86]  Whereas nowadays, I can tell you right now,
[2987.10 --> 2989.66]  if that chip's running with half of the cache of the other one,
[2989.72 --> 2992.30]  odds are very good that the rest of the cache works,
[2992.66 --> 2995.18]  but it's been fused off in a hardware fashion
[2995.18 --> 2996.34]  such that it can't be unlocked.
[2996.66 --> 2998.74]  Also, things like instruction set differentiation.
[2998.74 --> 3004.46]  This one, I saw Anantek make a bit of a snide remark
[3004.46 --> 3006.36]  in the middle of a completely unrelated article.
[3006.50 --> 3008.42]  I guess the assumption is Intel won't catch it there.
[3008.90 --> 3014.72]  But basically just the utter contempt that they have for that practice,
[3014.92 --> 3017.36]  where you're differentiating one product from another
[3017.36 --> 3021.10]  based on a software feature that benefits everybody.
[3021.10 --> 3025.60]  But this is exactly why I wasn't sure if it was different wafers entirely.
[3025.82 --> 3027.74]  I knew the bidding process was going on.
[3027.80 --> 3030.02]  I just thought there might have been multiple sets.
[3030.38 --> 3030.52]  Yeah.
[3031.88 --> 3034.06]  Well, guys, thank you guys for taking my call.
[3035.22 --> 3036.80]  Ghost says thank you for that.
[3037.02 --> 3039.46]  QCD says he's sorry, but he was really nervous,
[3039.54 --> 3040.34]  so he dropped the call.
[3040.62 --> 3043.08]  His words, as Ghost would say, just buy it.
[3044.36 --> 3045.34]  All right, take care.
[3045.74 --> 3046.16]  You too.
[3046.16 --> 3046.48]  Have a good one.
[3046.48 --> 3052.20]  All right, let me grab one of our other topics here.
[3052.30 --> 3053.76]  That's apparently an ongoing joke.
[3054.06 --> 3056.48]  Anytime PC Budget Solutions asks anything,
[3056.70 --> 3057.78]  Ghost just says, just buy it.
[3057.96 --> 3058.74]  Just buy it.
[3059.22 --> 3059.62]  Excellent.
[3061.62 --> 3063.80]  All right, so let's talk about that worm
[3063.80 --> 3065.22]  that can regrow its memories.
[3065.64 --> 3066.34]  This is crazy.
[3066.42 --> 3067.40]  This is kind of crazy.
[3067.52 --> 3068.84]  This was an article on The Verge
[3068.84 --> 3070.44]  that we were going to talk about last week,
[3070.52 --> 3071.94]  but then I think we forgot.
[3071.94 --> 3072.84]  Last week was crazy.
[3072.98 --> 3074.36]  So you can cut off its head,
[3074.74 --> 3075.88]  it will regrow its head,
[3075.88 --> 3077.08]  and remember things.
[3077.44 --> 3078.08]  Sort of.
[3078.42 --> 3078.90]  Sort of.
[3079.02 --> 3080.72]  You have to kind of like prod it
[3080.72 --> 3082.52]  in the direction of remembering that thing.
[3082.90 --> 3084.36]  So you have to do a little bit of training,
[3084.52 --> 3085.56]  but it will remember stuff.
[3085.70 --> 3086.46]  So here we go.
[3086.52 --> 3088.18]  I'm just going to pull up the article here.
[3088.52 --> 3088.80]  Let's see.
[3090.38 --> 3092.08]  Oh, that's disappointing.
[3092.40 --> 3093.32]  Where's my HDMI cable?
[3093.46 --> 3093.92]  There we go.
[3094.52 --> 3095.28]  Let's see if this works.
[3095.82 --> 3096.84]  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[3097.24 --> 3098.56]  This didn't work earlier today,
[3098.66 --> 3100.24]  but it's worked at other points in time.
[3100.28 --> 3100.72]  There we go.
[3100.72 --> 3101.20]  All right.
[3101.76 --> 3104.50]  So this worm right here,
[3104.50 --> 3107.78]  some memories just won't die,
[3107.96 --> 3110.64]  and some can be transferred to a whole new brain.
[3111.06 --> 3112.66]  Researchers at Tufts University have determined
[3112.66 --> 3114.74]  that a small yellow worm known as a planarian,
[3115.14 --> 3117.68]  which has long been studied for its regenerative properties,
[3117.76 --> 3119.70]  is able to grow back a lot more than just its body parts.
[3120.58 --> 3121.48]  So check this out.
[3121.96 --> 3123.94]  They decapitate the worm.
[3123.94 --> 3127.38]  So then they show you the process of, you know,
[3127.44 --> 3130.88]  how it grows back and, see, the head's back.
[3131.08 --> 3131.42]  Look at that.
[3132.66 --> 3134.30]  Planarians' brains control their behavior,
[3134.50 --> 3136.28]  but what the research, okay, blah, blah, blah, here it is.
[3136.34 --> 3137.14]  Ah, yes, here we go.
[3137.14 --> 3145.04]  So this particular species has an aversion to light, I believe it is.
[3146.40 --> 3149.46]  Yep, they have an aversion to open spaces and bright lights.
[3150.16 --> 3153.96]  So they have trained a sample of them to ignore it
[3153.96 --> 3155.06]  so they could find their meals.
[3155.28 --> 3156.46]  And after decapitation,
[3156.60 --> 3158.28]  worms that had gone through training
[3158.28 --> 3160.08]  were able to overcome their fears
[3160.08 --> 3162.08]  and start eating again much faster
[3162.08 --> 3164.62]  than the worms that hadn't been trained at all.
[3164.62 --> 3167.62]  However, the memories didn't come back immediately.
[3168.70 --> 3170.38]  So on those soap operas
[3170.38 --> 3172.92]  where the character has amnesia,
[3173.58 --> 3175.02]  maybe what actually happened was
[3175.02 --> 3177.06]  they got decapitated and they just needed to be reminded.
[3177.66 --> 3178.86]  Because they were all worms.
[3179.34 --> 3181.32]  And they're all just basically interchangeable, yes.
[3181.48 --> 3182.14]  Worms, good.
[3182.24 --> 3183.42]  That was better than what I said.
[3184.40 --> 3185.86]  That was kind of where I was going with it,
[3185.92 --> 3187.50]  but you got there faster and better.
[3189.88 --> 3191.08]  Stronger? Better, faster, stronger.
[3191.10 --> 3192.26]  Better, faster, stronger.
[3192.26 --> 3194.26]  Once you go black...
[3195.28 --> 3196.26]  Oh, wait, what was...
[3196.26 --> 3199.90]  Take a black adventure, get amazing treasure.
[3200.06 --> 3201.96]  I think that was ECS's campaign.
[3202.28 --> 3202.60]  Really?
[3202.76 --> 3204.70]  Yeah, with their black series motherboards.
[3205.20 --> 3206.50]  It was unbelievable.
[3206.74 --> 3209.60]  It had like this flash campaign video
[3209.60 --> 3210.74]  that went along with it.
[3210.74 --> 3210.96]  Oh, my goodness.
[3211.26 --> 3212.44]  Let me see if I can find it.
[3212.50 --> 3217.64]  Take a black adventure, get amazing treasure, ECS.
[3218.02 --> 3219.32]  It used to be on my blog
[3219.32 --> 3221.66]  back when LinusTechTips.com was a blog.
[3222.12 --> 3223.42]  Yeah, we had some problems with that
[3223.42 --> 3224.22]  when we first released.
[3224.68 --> 3225.16]  Did we?
[3225.40 --> 3227.94]  Same URL, so linking was kind of weird.
[3228.32 --> 3229.08]  Oh, I see.
[3230.82 --> 3231.80]  Okay, yeah.
[3232.12 --> 3234.04]  I mean, if ECS has any sense,
[3234.12 --> 3235.32]  they'll have taken this down by now, but...
[3235.90 --> 3237.32]  And we were having stuff
[3237.32 --> 3239.04]  where people were clicking links
[3239.04 --> 3241.90]  to Linus Tech Tips, the blog,
[3242.28 --> 3243.64]  and it was bringing them to the forum,
[3243.64 --> 3244.82]  so they were like, what?
[3246.66 --> 3247.62]  What is this?
[3247.62 --> 3249.64]  Oh, okay.
[3252.26 --> 3253.92]  I really hope I can find this
[3253.92 --> 3255.04]  because it was so awesome.
[3255.16 --> 3256.88]  It was like the epitome of like
[3256.88 --> 3259.38]  random Taiwanese marketing.
[3262.14 --> 3264.66]  Take a black adventure, get amazing treasure,
[3264.98 --> 3265.84]  or something like that.
[3266.52 --> 3266.96]  Awesome.
[3266.96 --> 3270.20]  It was on the ECS website,
[3270.52 --> 3272.12]  and it was like this entire like
[3272.12 --> 3274.62]  dedicated landing page for it.
[3277.42 --> 3278.32]  Yeah, it's okay.
[3278.42 --> 3279.64]  I don't remember anymore.
[3281.98 --> 3283.26]  Do we have another live caller?
[3283.26 --> 3289.42]  Jazz Piano.
[3289.98 --> 3292.00]  We do look at Twitch chat,
[3292.44 --> 3295.82]  but not like all that often,
[3296.14 --> 3297.04]  so sometimes we'll answer stuff.
[3297.04 --> 3297.84]  You know, Linus,
[3297.96 --> 3299.72]  I've got some guy here.
[3300.20 --> 3300.74]  Some guy.
[3300.88 --> 3301.42]  Sounds great.
[3301.70 --> 3302.10]  Bring him in.
[3302.22 --> 3302.92]  Sup, some guy.
[3306.20 --> 3307.58]  What's his name going on?
[3309.00 --> 3309.72]  Hey, some guy,
[3309.82 --> 3310.90]  can you raise your dongers?
[3312.00 --> 3313.14]  Oh, why are you here?
[3314.26 --> 3315.74]  Oh, why are you here?
[3315.74 --> 3315.78]  Invite.
[3315.86 --> 3316.06]  Hand me.
[3319.16 --> 3320.30]  No one did it.
[3320.50 --> 3321.04]  No one did it.
[3321.06 --> 3321.66]  I'm so happy.
[3321.68 --> 3323.30]  We haven't actually even implemented
[3323.30 --> 3326.58]  the like Twitch chat auto-moderation thing.
[3327.34 --> 3327.72]  Um, hello?
[3328.36 --> 3328.68]  Hello?
[3331.00 --> 3332.20]  I think he's the first one
[3332.20 --> 3333.62]  that came in and opened with hello.
[3336.74 --> 3337.96]  But then a long delay,
[3338.24 --> 3339.62]  so I think he loses points there.
[3340.18 --> 3340.44]  Yeah.
[3342.22 --> 3343.14]  Caller, you're live.
[3344.26 --> 3345.44]  Um, so I was wondering
[3345.44 --> 3346.84]  if I5 quad cores
[3346.84 --> 3348.38]  will be, um,
[3348.46 --> 3350.04]  insufficient for games
[3350.04 --> 3351.06]  once games start using
[3351.06 --> 3352.20]  6 and 8 cores.
[3353.54 --> 3354.56]  Very good question.
[3355.14 --> 3357.08]  I think, I think part of the problem
[3357.08 --> 3357.86]  with this is going to be
[3357.86 --> 3358.84]  the reason why games
[3358.84 --> 3359.40]  are going to start using
[3359.40 --> 3359.92]  so many cores
[3359.92 --> 3361.16]  is because of the console platform.
[3361.56 --> 3363.64]  And those processors are so slow
[3363.64 --> 3365.86]  that it almost won't matter.
[3366.06 --> 3366.80]  So two things.
[3366.90 --> 3368.80]  One, those processors are so slow
[3368.80 --> 3371.12]  that a quad core i5
[3371.12 --> 3372.38]  is going to be faster
[3372.38 --> 3373.38]  cumulatively.
[3373.62 --> 3373.88]  Yeah.
[3374.30 --> 3374.78]  Anyway.
[3375.00 --> 3375.12]  Yeah.
[3375.12 --> 3376.16]  Because we're not even talking
[3376.16 --> 3377.26]  like full-fledged
[3377.26 --> 3379.26]  Piledriver FX processors 8 cores.
[3379.40 --> 3380.28]  We're talking like
[3380.28 --> 3381.18]  anemic,
[3381.80 --> 3382.86]  more like, uh,
[3382.86 --> 3384.00]  mobile platform.
[3384.00 --> 3385.84]  So even if you have a quad core,
[3385.94 --> 3386.60]  it'll just be able to
[3386.60 --> 3387.44]  shoot things through
[3387.44 --> 3388.22]  so quickly
[3388.22 --> 3390.20]  that it won't matter.
[3390.28 --> 3391.10]  And not only that,
[3391.22 --> 3392.28]  but the way that AMD
[3392.28 --> 3393.40]  implements
[3393.40 --> 3395.04]  two cores
[3395.04 --> 3396.32]  is different
[3396.32 --> 3397.34]  from the way that Intel
[3397.34 --> 3397.78]  does it.
[3397.92 --> 3398.44]  So AMD
[3398.44 --> 3399.82]  has kind of,
[3399.94 --> 3400.28]  really,
[3400.38 --> 3401.60]  it's one and a half cores.
[3402.36 --> 3403.88]  So their 8 core processor
[3403.88 --> 3405.70]  in terms of the actual logic on it
[3405.70 --> 3406.86]  is more like 6.
[3407.06 --> 3408.20]  Not all cores are made the same.
[3408.28 --> 3408.54]  Yes.
[3408.86 --> 3409.74]  Whereas Intel,
[3410.10 --> 3411.84]  every core is a discrete core
[3411.84 --> 3412.98]  from start to finish
[3412.98 --> 3414.76]  save for some shared cache.
[3415.46 --> 3418.08]  So I think that we're,
[3418.24 --> 3419.56]  I'm going to make another bold prediction.
[3419.68 --> 3420.80]  I think we're 10 years away
[3420.80 --> 3423.14]  from the console
[3423.14 --> 3425.14]  multi-core optimizations
[3425.14 --> 3427.04]  impacting the way that
[3427.04 --> 3428.88]  you can use a quad core to game
[3428.88 --> 3429.72]  in any meaningful way.
[3429.80 --> 3430.88]  So saying 10 years away,
[3430.88 --> 3432.46]  you're expecting the next console platform?
[3432.66 --> 3434.30]  I'm expecting the next console platform
[3434.30 --> 3435.00]  to be what actually,
[3435.00 --> 3435.62]  That'll make the difference?
[3435.82 --> 3436.36]  I think so.
[3436.80 --> 3437.88]  I wouldn't say that's wrong.
[3439.12 --> 3439.82]  Okay, thanks.
[3440.26 --> 3440.86]  Thanks, man.
[3440.98 --> 3442.16]  Okay, thanks for calling in.
[3446.38 --> 3447.88]  It could help maybe
[3447.88 --> 3449.04]  if you wanted to buy
[3449.04 --> 3450.06]  a more, like,
[3450.16 --> 3451.84]  cost-efficient lower-end processor
[3451.84 --> 3452.82]  that had a lot of cores.
[3454.74 --> 3455.18]  Yeah.
[3455.80 --> 3457.06]  But I'd still probably
[3457.06 --> 3458.32]  just go with a fast quad core.
[3458.70 --> 3460.28]  I mean, the thing about that is
[3460.28 --> 3461.86]  the CPU makers
[3461.86 --> 3463.42]  have been trying to make that matter
[3463.42 --> 3466.60]  since, what, like, 2008?
[3466.98 --> 3467.26]  Yeah.
[3468.50 --> 3470.00]  And they haven't had,
[3470.12 --> 3471.64]  oh no, it must have been before that.
[3472.26 --> 3473.82]  I don't, when did the X2 launch?
[3474.28 --> 3474.84]  Man, I'm,
[3474.98 --> 3476.30]  I don't even remember anymore.
[3477.20 --> 3478.46]  I feel so old.
[3478.74 --> 3479.02]  Yeah.
[3479.78 --> 3481.20]  I've never been good at that, though.
[3481.24 --> 3482.04]  I've always been like,
[3482.10 --> 3482.80]  oh, it was released
[3482.80 --> 3485.04]  five years ago in 2011.
[3485.04 --> 3486.00]  And I'm like, oh, wait.
[3489.00 --> 3490.36]  It feels like that was
[3490.36 --> 3491.18]  a long time ago,
[3491.28 --> 3492.60]  but then it doesn't feel like
[3492.60 --> 3493.72]  release dates that happened
[3493.72 --> 3494.98]  in, like, 2009, 2008
[3494.98 --> 3495.84]  were that long ago.
[3496.00 --> 3497.32]  So it's so confusing.
[3497.70 --> 3498.78]  Sometimes I get kind of
[3498.78 --> 3499.64]  thrown for a loop
[3499.64 --> 3500.88]  when I realize that
[3500.88 --> 3501.72]  Linus Media Group
[3501.72 --> 3502.30]  has been running
[3502.30 --> 3503.34]  for seven months now.
[3503.60 --> 3504.66]  Much to the chagrin
[3504.66 --> 3506.08]  of YPaul123.
[3506.08 --> 3508.94]  We're calling him out
[3508.94 --> 3510.00]  so many times.
[3510.90 --> 3511.94]  You know, the funny thing
[3511.94 --> 3512.58]  about him is
[3512.58 --> 3513.62]  he seems to hate us,
[3513.62 --> 3514.40]  especially you.
[3514.56 --> 3515.04]  But he watches so many.
[3515.04 --> 3515.66]  But he watches
[3515.66 --> 3516.54]  like every video.
[3516.74 --> 3517.02]  Yeah.
[3517.88 --> 3519.48]  Thanks for keeping me
[3519.48 --> 3521.30]  and keeping my job going.
[3521.42 --> 3522.28]  Yeah, I think it's Diesel.
[3523.16 --> 3523.56]  Diesel?
[3523.70 --> 3524.62]  Yeah, I think it's Diesel.
[3524.94 --> 3526.28]  I think it's Diesel's troll account.
[3526.42 --> 3527.86]  Did he not show up
[3527.86 --> 3529.30]  until, whoa.
[3530.10 --> 3530.68]  I don't know.
[3531.16 --> 3531.96]  He's not on the
[3531.96 --> 3533.06]  original live streams.
[3533.94 --> 3534.34]  Yeah.
[3535.06 --> 3535.66]  It's Diesel.
[3535.66 --> 3536.60]  No, actually,
[3536.72 --> 3538.26]  I think YPaul did tell me
[3538.26 --> 3539.84]  to get that piece of bleep
[3539.84 --> 3541.18]  slick off the show
[3541.18 --> 3542.10]  on like live stream
[3542.10 --> 3542.64]  one or two.
[3542.88 --> 3543.12]  Really?
[3543.26 --> 3544.12]  So pretty early on.
[3544.20 --> 3544.90]  Yeah, pretty early on.
[3544.94 --> 3545.30]  Maybe it's not.
[3545.30 --> 3546.08]  Well, but Diesel
[3546.08 --> 3547.28]  technically worked here then.
[3547.72 --> 3548.08]  Did he?
[3548.68 --> 3549.12]  And even before.
[3549.12 --> 3549.36]  Yep.
[3549.86 --> 3550.24]  Hmm.
[3551.28 --> 3552.42]  But I've talked to Diesel
[3552.42 --> 3553.52]  like off the record
[3553.52 --> 3554.28]  about you
[3554.28 --> 3555.38]  and he doesn't hate you
[3555.38 --> 3555.86]  that much.
[3556.00 --> 3557.44]  No, but he's
[3557.44 --> 3558.46]  an awesome troll.
[3558.82 --> 3559.44]  That's true.
[3559.66 --> 3560.16]  And he knows
[3560.16 --> 3561.48]  that I don't necessarily
[3561.48 --> 3562.72]  hate the YPaul thing.
[3562.78 --> 3563.38]  I find it funny.
[3564.16 --> 3564.52]  Right.
[3564.52 --> 3566.04]  People are asking
[3566.04 --> 3567.52]  who is YPaul123.
[3567.98 --> 3568.50]  He's going to get
[3568.50 --> 3569.86]  so much freaking
[3569.86 --> 3571.60]  credibility now.
[3572.42 --> 3572.96]  Yeah, I know.
[3573.68 --> 3574.46]  YPaul's like,
[3574.54 --> 3575.28]  oh, people are like
[3575.28 --> 3575.94]  he was on the show
[3575.94 --> 3576.38]  last week.
[3576.46 --> 3577.06]  No, no.
[3577.24 --> 3578.48]  That is a different
[3578.48 --> 3578.94]  Paul.
[3579.04 --> 3579.94]  Yeah, no.
[3580.20 --> 3581.44]  Paul from Newegg TV
[3581.44 --> 3582.64]  is Paul.
[3584.08 --> 3584.56]  YPaul123
[3584.56 --> 3585.48]  is some troll
[3585.48 --> 3586.34]  that posts on
[3586.34 --> 3587.20]  like every Linus
[3587.20 --> 3587.88]  Tech Tips video
[3587.88 --> 3588.52]  about how much
[3588.52 --> 3589.14]  he hates Slick.
[3589.42 --> 3589.98]  I don't actually
[3589.98 --> 3590.56]  think it's Diesel.
[3590.56 --> 3591.04]  But it would be
[3591.04 --> 3592.08]  hilarious if it was.
[3592.14 --> 3592.80]  It would be awesome
[3592.80 --> 3593.52]  if it was Diesel.
[3593.94 --> 3594.50]  Someone says
[3594.50 --> 3596.12]  YPaul123 is Slick's mom.
[3596.84 --> 3598.00]  No, I think Slick's mom
[3598.00 --> 3598.66]  would be too worried
[3598.66 --> 3599.62]  about damaging
[3599.62 --> 3600.52]  his fragile ego.
[3602.78 --> 3603.46]  Fragile ego?
[3603.68 --> 3604.34]  I was standing up
[3604.34 --> 3605.00]  in a convertible
[3605.00 --> 3605.54]  pointing people
[3605.54 --> 3606.22]  where to go.
[3607.22 --> 3608.26]  I think I'm fine.
[3608.60 --> 3609.34]  Yeah, I was
[3609.34 --> 3610.24]  because I went
[3610.24 --> 3611.12]  to rescue him today
[3611.12 --> 3611.60]  because I have
[3611.60 --> 3612.40]  a AAA membership
[3612.40 --> 3613.74]  and he doesn't.
[3614.06 --> 3614.96]  Speaking of which,
[3615.12 --> 3616.14]  I should get a bounty
[3616.14 --> 3616.64]  out of your
[3616.64 --> 3617.44]  Cash for Clunkers,
[3617.50 --> 3617.88]  shouldn't I?
[3617.88 --> 3618.48]  Probably.
[3620.02 --> 3620.28]  Probably.
[3620.28 --> 3620.94]  If that ends up
[3620.94 --> 3621.74]  happening, probably.
[3621.90 --> 3622.76]  So basically,
[3623.02 --> 3623.52]  I'm like,
[3623.62 --> 3624.68]  I call AAA
[3624.68 --> 3627.50]  and then I jet out there.
[3627.54 --> 3628.76]  No, you didn't speed.
[3629.24 --> 3630.22]  But I jet
[3630.22 --> 3631.50]  at the speed limit.
[3631.68 --> 3631.86]  Yeah.
[3632.52 --> 3633.48]  Because I was
[3633.48 --> 3634.42]  deeply worried
[3634.42 --> 3635.60]  about if a tow truck
[3635.60 --> 3636.34]  showed up
[3636.34 --> 3637.96]  and there was no
[3637.96 --> 3638.88]  BCAA
[3639.80 --> 3640.54]  is what it's called here,
[3640.58 --> 3641.24]  but there was no
[3641.24 --> 3642.36]  AAA member there.
[3643.60 --> 3644.54]  I didn't know
[3644.54 --> 3645.62]  how they would react.
[3645.70 --> 3646.26]  I don't know what they do.
[3646.32 --> 3647.12]  I don't know if maybe
[3647.12 --> 3648.60]  it counts as one of my tows,
[3648.66 --> 3649.44]  but they just take off
[3649.44 --> 3650.28]  and they leave him there.
[3650.38 --> 3651.70]  Like, no idea.
[3652.24 --> 3653.62]  So I was like
[3653.62 --> 3654.16]  jetting down there.
[3654.20 --> 3655.04]  So he's coming
[3655.04 --> 3655.82]  this way on the bridge.
[3655.88 --> 3656.48]  I'm coming this way
[3656.48 --> 3656.96]  on the bridge.
[3657.08 --> 3657.76]  So I had to go
[3657.76 --> 3658.44]  all the way over
[3658.44 --> 3658.82]  and I'm like,
[3658.88 --> 3659.68]  okay, there's no tow truck
[3659.68 --> 3660.06]  there yet.
[3660.34 --> 3661.08]  But there was like
[3661.08 --> 3661.96]  some other biker
[3661.96 --> 3662.60]  pulled over
[3662.60 --> 3663.58]  and Slick's like
[3663.58 --> 3664.56]  standing in the back
[3664.56 --> 3665.08]  of his car
[3665.08 --> 3665.62]  being like,
[3665.92 --> 3666.82]  whoa, everybody,
[3667.08 --> 3667.54]  I'm here.
[3667.64 --> 3668.58]  Please don't hit me.
[3669.34 --> 3670.46]  And then I have to go
[3670.46 --> 3671.26]  all the way around
[3671.26 --> 3672.46]  and then come all the way back
[3672.46 --> 3674.18]  and not lane splitting,
[3674.34 --> 3674.68]  of course,
[3674.82 --> 3676.00]  in order to get to his car
[3676.00 --> 3677.46]  as quickly as I possibly could.
[3678.92 --> 3679.88]  At the speed limit.
[3680.14 --> 3680.96]  At the speed limit.
[3684.82 --> 3686.00]  Check for messages.
[3687.46 --> 3689.54]  Okay, let's move into...
[3689.54 --> 3691.34]  Speaking of online identities,
[3691.48 --> 3692.32]  we've actually talked about
[3692.32 --> 3693.32]  this a fair bit today.
[3694.00 --> 3695.18]  And I'm going to go ahead
[3695.18 --> 3696.18]  and switch over to my laptop.
[3696.18 --> 3698.78]  So, Harry Potter author...
[3698.78 --> 3699.56]  So this article's
[3699.56 --> 3700.30]  from earlier in the week.
[3700.36 --> 3701.38]  This is from the 14th.
[3701.64 --> 3702.76]  So the Harry Potter author,
[3702.84 --> 3703.68]  J.K. Rowling,
[3703.82 --> 3705.06]  assumed a male identity
[3705.06 --> 3706.20]  to secretly release
[3706.20 --> 3707.28]  a detective novel.
[3708.58 --> 3709.90]  So, da-da-da-da-da-da,
[3710.00 --> 3710.98]  one of the most famous authors
[3710.98 --> 3711.76]  of blah-blah-blah-blah.
[3712.02 --> 3712.64]  So basically,
[3712.86 --> 3713.70]  the Sunday Times acted
[3713.70 --> 3714.54]  on an anonymous tip
[3714.54 --> 3715.20]  to investigate
[3715.20 --> 3716.76]  the circumstances.
[3717.92 --> 3719.14]  This particular novel,
[3719.22 --> 3720.08]  it was called something,
[3720.22 --> 3720.96]  The Cuckoo's Calling,
[3721.04 --> 3721.36]  there you go,
[3721.36 --> 3723.46]  by Robert Galbraith.
[3724.00 --> 3724.86]  Apparently sold only
[3724.86 --> 3726.46]  around 1,500 copies
[3726.46 --> 3727.12]  on hardback.
[3728.06 --> 3729.46]  But now that everyone
[3729.46 --> 3731.00]  knows who it actually is,
[3731.04 --> 3731.90]  it's the top-selling book
[3731.90 --> 3732.90]  on Amazon in the U.S.
[3732.90 --> 3733.52]  and the U.K.
[3734.54 --> 3737.50]  So, they acted on the tip,
[3737.62 --> 3738.52]  followed up with Rowling,
[3738.58 --> 3739.18]  who confessed,
[3739.24 --> 3740.00]  I had hoped to keep this
[3740.00 --> 3741.04]  a secret a little longer,
[3741.34 --> 3743.00]  because becoming someone else
[3743.00 --> 3743.52]  has been such
[3743.52 --> 3744.68]  a liberating experience.
[3745.16 --> 3747.10]  And there was a lot of debate
[3747.10 --> 3747.84]  that I saw,
[3748.12 --> 3750.12]  is this a marketing tactic?
[3750.12 --> 3751.50]  was the intention
[3751.50 --> 3752.94]  to release it
[3752.94 --> 3755.60]  and kind of do this
[3755.60 --> 3756.36]  as a stunt
[3756.36 --> 3758.08]  to create publicity for it?
[3758.44 --> 3759.72]  And I disagreed
[3759.72 --> 3760.58]  with that very strongly,
[3760.70 --> 3761.34]  and it looks like,
[3761.52 --> 3762.72]  it looks like I was right,
[3763.30 --> 3765.82]  because she's come out now
[3765.82 --> 3766.24]  and said,
[3766.32 --> 3766.86]  here's an article
[3766.86 --> 3768.02]  from Business Insider,
[3769.04 --> 3769.36]  and said,
[3769.42 --> 3770.70]  this is how the leak occurred.
[3770.98 --> 3771.94]  It was actually,
[3772.44 --> 3774.04]  one of London's
[3774.04 --> 3775.48]  leading entertainment law firms,
[3775.62 --> 3776.12]  Russell's,
[3776.18 --> 3777.38]  admitted that a partner
[3777.38 --> 3778.72]  had let the information
[3778.72 --> 3779.94]  slip to his wife's
[3779.94 --> 3780.82]  best friend
[3780.82 --> 3781.98]  in a private conversation.
[3782.42 --> 3783.30]  The wife's best friend
[3783.30 --> 3784.98]  has deleted her Twitter account,
[3785.38 --> 3786.60]  and, uh...
[3786.60 --> 3787.42]  She tweeted it.
[3787.80 --> 3788.66]  Yeah, she tweeted it,
[3788.74 --> 3789.80]  but she has now deleted
[3789.80 --> 3790.80]  her Facebook profile
[3790.80 --> 3791.94]  and the Twitter account
[3791.94 --> 3792.82]  that the tweet
[3792.82 --> 3793.76]  originated from,
[3794.10 --> 3795.42]  apparently trying to...
[3795.42 --> 3796.34]  Because you can totally
[3796.34 --> 3797.10]  remove things
[3797.10 --> 3797.56]  from the internet.
[3797.80 --> 3798.90]  Yeah, because she's trying
[3798.90 --> 3799.42]  to remove herself
[3799.42 --> 3799.92]  from the internet.
[3800.02 --> 3800.38]  No one will know
[3800.38 --> 3801.04]  who she is now.
[3801.44 --> 3802.76]  And Rowling just says,
[3802.82 --> 3803.76]  I feel very angry
[3803.76 --> 3804.76]  that my trust turned out
[3804.76 --> 3805.62]  to be misplaced.
[3805.72 --> 3806.64]  To say I'm disappointed
[3806.64 --> 3807.52]  is an understatement.
[3807.52 --> 3808.50]  So, I don't think
[3808.50 --> 3809.16]  this was it at all.
[3809.24 --> 3810.02]  I think really she just
[3810.02 --> 3811.10]  wanted to write a book
[3811.10 --> 3812.64]  with no expectations.
[3813.76 --> 3814.96]  And not be told
[3814.96 --> 3815.86]  that she's awesome
[3815.86 --> 3816.50]  because she's the
[3816.50 --> 3817.02]  Harry Potter author.
[3817.06 --> 3817.62]  I mean, this is one
[3817.62 --> 3818.26]  of the reasons,
[3818.46 --> 3819.28]  to my understanding,
[3819.40 --> 3820.06]  that she didn't keep
[3820.06 --> 3820.92]  writing Harry Potter books
[3820.92 --> 3822.12]  because she could
[3822.12 --> 3822.92]  keep on
[3822.92 --> 3824.12]  cashing them checks.
[3824.80 --> 3825.04]  You know,
[3825.10 --> 3825.72]  Harry Potter
[3825.72 --> 3826.94]  and the,
[3827.06 --> 3827.64]  you know,
[3827.80 --> 3828.68]  secret of the
[3828.68 --> 3830.46]  lettuce wrap.
[3832.26 --> 3832.66]  Bunny.
[3833.20 --> 3833.56]  Bacon.
[3833.56 --> 3834.98]  Sausage.
[3834.98 --> 3838.16]  If I say sausage
[3838.16 --> 3839.04]  when you said bacon
[3839.04 --> 3839.38]  already,
[3839.50 --> 3840.22]  is that just kind of
[3840.22 --> 3840.48]  cheating?
[3840.78 --> 3841.48]  Like, I haven't really
[3841.48 --> 3842.18]  contributed anything?
[3842.42 --> 3843.60]  Do you consider bacon
[3843.60 --> 3844.50]  and sausage different
[3844.50 --> 3844.84]  enough?
[3845.22 --> 3845.52]  Yes.
[3845.80 --> 3846.68]  They're both smoked.
[3847.12 --> 3847.80]  They're both pork.
[3847.92 --> 3848.66]  But they're way
[3848.66 --> 3849.34]  different textures.
[3850.04 --> 3850.60]  That's true.
[3850.62 --> 3851.42]  And eating experiences.
[3851.68 --> 3853.12]  Sausage is like a
[3853.12 --> 3853.32]  cylinder.
[3853.32 --> 3854.58]  If you ground up bacon,
[3854.74 --> 3855.86]  would that be the best
[3855.86 --> 3856.58]  sausage ever?
[3857.64 --> 3858.50]  If you ground up bacon
[3858.50 --> 3859.70]  and like put it into it.
[3859.76 --> 3860.16]  Yeah.
[3860.54 --> 3860.88]  Whoa.
[3861.08 --> 3861.74]  That would be strong
[3861.74 --> 3862.58]  We need to get the guys
[3862.58 --> 3863.62]  from Epic Meal Time
[3863.62 --> 3864.74]  to try that.
[3864.82 --> 3865.84]  Make a bacon sausage.
[3865.92 --> 3866.66]  Bacon sausage.
[3867.92 --> 3868.32]  Yeah.
[3868.88 --> 3869.48]  We should make like
[3869.48 --> 3870.50]  Linus takes...
[3870.50 --> 3871.10]  We should,
[3871.22 --> 3872.12]  we should make a channel
[3872.12 --> 3873.18]  called Nerd Meals.
[3873.64 --> 3874.32]  Nerd Meals?
[3874.52 --> 3875.42]  Nerd Meals.
[3875.50 --> 3876.06]  Nerd Meals.
[3876.14 --> 3876.78]  Which is like
[3876.78 --> 3878.14]  There'll only be one meal.
[3878.36 --> 3878.92]  Kinsey bowl.
[3879.80 --> 3880.94]  Meals that are easy to cook
[3880.94 --> 3881.86]  and you can do it like
[3881.86 --> 3882.78]  in between a match.
[3882.92 --> 3883.70]  So it'd have to be like
[3883.70 --> 3884.94]  a short enough period of time.
[3885.60 --> 3886.38]  Like in queue.
[3886.52 --> 3887.28]  Like a meal you can make
[3887.28 --> 3888.06]  while you're in queue.
[3888.30 --> 3889.08]  So the challenge
[3889.08 --> 3889.92]  would have to be
[3889.92 --> 3890.92]  that we would have to
[3890.92 --> 3891.98]  actually execute
[3891.98 --> 3893.64]  the creation of the meal
[3893.64 --> 3895.20]  within that period of time.
[3895.36 --> 3896.18]  And you have to be able
[3896.18 --> 3897.44]  to like make it
[3897.44 --> 3898.84]  and be in your chair
[3898.84 --> 3899.64]  for the match start.
[3899.74 --> 3900.18]  Eating it.
[3900.48 --> 3900.88]  Eating it.
[3901.08 --> 3901.80]  So you can make it
[3901.80 --> 3902.32]  at your desk,
[3902.42 --> 3902.64]  whatever,
[3902.72 --> 3903.12]  it doesn't matter,
[3903.20 --> 3904.00]  but you have to be able
[3904.00 --> 3905.54]  to be back in your chair.
[3905.54 --> 3906.72]  Do we restrict ourselves
[3906.72 --> 3907.54]  to food you could eat
[3907.54 --> 3908.42]  with just one hand?
[3909.38 --> 3910.08]  Because to me
[3910.08 --> 3911.22]  when I'm using my computer
[3911.22 --> 3912.16]  one hand in food
[3912.16 --> 3912.86]  is very important.
[3913.36 --> 3914.54]  I think we'd have to have
[3914.54 --> 3914.90]  like categories.
[3914.90 --> 3915.92]  For sanitary reasons.
[3915.92 --> 3921.50]  Like we'd have to have
[3921.50 --> 3921.92]  categories
[3921.92 --> 3922.48]  because there could be
[3922.48 --> 3924.56]  like the Civilization V food.
[3924.96 --> 3925.28]  Yeah,
[3925.50 --> 3926.24]  because that
[3926.24 --> 3927.04]  you could have
[3927.04 --> 3928.24]  like a 16 course
[3928.24 --> 3930.02]  like traditional Chinese feast
[3930.02 --> 3931.32]  in between
[3931.32 --> 3933.22]  friggin Civ V matches.
[3933.76 --> 3934.62]  Or like it would have
[3934.62 --> 3935.06]  to be something
[3935.06 --> 3936.58]  that takes longer to eat
[3936.58 --> 3938.64]  as you get into it.
[3938.84 --> 3939.00]  Yeah.
[3939.08 --> 3939.74]  So it's like something
[3939.74 --> 3941.50]  that's like delicious
[3941.50 --> 3942.70]  but it's like so rich
[3942.70 --> 3943.54]  you can only take a bite
[3943.54 --> 3944.22]  every six minutes.
[3944.22 --> 3946.18]  Oh man,
[3946.26 --> 3947.16]  that is perfect.
[3947.62 --> 3948.14]  For Sanify,
[3948.32 --> 3949.02]  that is perfect.
[3949.82 --> 3950.68]  But then we could also
[3950.68 --> 3953.22]  have like the Counter-Strike
[3953.22 --> 3954.20]  where it's got to be
[3954.20 --> 3954.78]  one hand
[3954.78 --> 3955.94]  and it can't be something
[3955.94 --> 3956.56]  that's going to stick
[3956.56 --> 3957.06]  on your hands
[3957.06 --> 3957.52]  because your hands
[3957.52 --> 3957.80]  are going to have
[3957.80 --> 3958.44]  to stay clean.
[3958.98 --> 3960.14]  But then it can maybe
[3960.14 --> 3960.90]  take a little bit
[3960.90 --> 3961.40]  to prepare
[3961.40 --> 3962.84]  because it's going to
[3962.84 --> 3963.78]  have to be between meals.
[3963.78 --> 3964.02]  Boom!
[3964.18 --> 3965.46]  This is the entire preparation.
[3965.74 --> 3966.64]  Bag of blueberries.
[3967.42 --> 3967.70]  Yeah.
[3969.42 --> 3970.58]  That's all you can really do
[3970.58 --> 3971.44]  when you play Counter-Strike.
[3971.66 --> 3971.84]  Yeah.
[3972.12 --> 3973.06]  Do you eat one at a time?
[3973.06 --> 3974.22]  I just got three.
[3975.90 --> 3976.26]  Okay.
[3976.98 --> 3977.58]  And there are like
[3977.58 --> 3978.46]  three of the biggest ones
[3978.46 --> 3978.84]  that are in there.
[3979.62 --> 3980.42]  How do you know?
[3981.00 --> 3982.28]  How could you possibly know
[3982.28 --> 3983.26]  which three are the biggest
[3983.26 --> 3984.24]  blueberries in this bag?
[3984.24 --> 3984.96]  Because I looked inside.
[3985.44 --> 3985.84]  Inside?
[3986.10 --> 3986.94]  That's like saying
[3986.94 --> 3987.72]  because you play
[3987.72 --> 3989.10]  the how many bubble gum
[3989.10 --> 3990.80]  things are inside
[3990.80 --> 3991.44]  that you can
[3991.44 --> 3992.74]  somehow magically know.
[3992.96 --> 3993.52]  I like them better
[3993.52 --> 3994.22]  when they're cold though.
[3994.56 --> 3994.94]  Yeah, me too.
[3995.62 --> 3996.54]  They were left on the table.
[3996.86 --> 3997.44]  It actually like
[3997.44 --> 3998.70]  I was gone for a while, eh?
[3999.26 --> 3999.98]  I couldn't find them.
[4000.62 --> 4001.20]  Why would I look
[4001.20 --> 4002.32]  in an American Eagle bag?
[4002.32 --> 4004.50]  Because you love
[4004.50 --> 4005.56]  American Eagle so hard?
[4005.92 --> 4006.52]  I was like
[4006.52 --> 4007.78]  where the heck
[4007.78 --> 4008.86]  are the blueberries?
[4009.34 --> 4009.64]  I was like
[4009.64 --> 4009.98]  did you put them
[4009.98 --> 4010.46]  in the fridge?
[4010.54 --> 4010.76]  No.
[4010.86 --> 4011.20]  Did you put them
[4011.20 --> 4011.58]  in the freezer?
[4011.74 --> 4012.00]  No.
[4012.20 --> 4012.66]  Someone says
[4012.66 --> 4013.50]  unwashed berries
[4013.50 --> 4014.14]  are a problem
[4014.14 --> 4015.20]  asking if we washed them.
[4015.84 --> 4016.00]  Nope.
[4016.00 --> 4016.80]  No guys, it's okay.
[4017.02 --> 4017.48]  Sweaty berries
[4017.48 --> 4017.98]  aren't a problem
[4017.98 --> 4019.08]  for either of us.
[4019.24 --> 4020.20]  And these are from
[4020.20 --> 4021.44]  No Pistoside Farm.
[4023.10 --> 4023.66]  Just put them
[4023.66 --> 4024.06]  in your mouth
[4024.06 --> 4026.74]  and swallow.
[4026.74 --> 4029.68]  Okay, this one's bigger
[4029.68 --> 4030.36]  than any of the ones
[4030.36 --> 4030.64]  you had.
[4031.10 --> 4031.38]  Nope.
[4032.14 --> 4032.78]  They were like
[4032.78 --> 4033.34]  monstrous.
[4033.54 --> 4033.96]  My ass.
[4035.64 --> 4036.46]  I think one of them
[4036.46 --> 4037.02]  was like a
[4037.02 --> 4038.12]  crazy mutant
[4038.12 --> 4038.70]  dual berry.
[4038.70 --> 4039.48]  I think you ate
[4039.48 --> 4040.14]  them so fast
[4040.14 --> 4040.74]  because you didn't
[4040.74 --> 4041.24]  want to have to
[4041.24 --> 4041.76]  prove that they
[4041.76 --> 4042.16]  were the biggest
[4042.16 --> 4042.70]  ones in there.
[4043.20 --> 4043.72]  They were probably
[4043.72 --> 4044.42]  the smallest ones
[4044.42 --> 4044.72]  in there.
[4046.02 --> 4046.66]  Size about that
[4046.66 --> 4046.98]  with you.
[4047.98 --> 4048.72]  Size of the berries.
[4049.50 --> 4050.02]  Do we have
[4050.02 --> 4050.44]  another color?
[4050.44 --> 4054.62]  I think Whaler's
[4054.62 --> 4055.32]  testing his mic.
[4055.92 --> 4056.24]  Alright.
[4057.94 --> 4059.54]  Man, I'm so excited
[4059.54 --> 4060.50]  for Whaler's system.
[4061.62 --> 4061.98]  Really?
[4062.24 --> 4063.36]  I gotta get him
[4063.36 --> 4064.12]  to explain it again
[4064.12 --> 4064.94]  because I forgot
[4064.94 --> 4065.68]  a lot of the details
[4065.68 --> 4066.84]  but he's gonna be
[4066.84 --> 4067.58]  making a build log
[4067.58 --> 4068.28]  for it and stuff
[4068.28 --> 4068.80]  and like,
[4069.44 --> 4070.52]  oh man, it's gonna be
[4070.52 --> 4070.54]  crazy.
[4070.54 --> 4071.02]  It's gonna be like
[4071.02 --> 4071.50]  crazy?
[4071.90 --> 4072.18]  Yeah.
[4072.94 --> 4073.60]  Here, let me see
[4073.60 --> 4074.06]  if I have another
[4074.06 --> 4074.52]  topic here.
[4074.58 --> 4075.22]  Oh, Scythe USA
[4075.22 --> 4075.68]  is back.
[4076.36 --> 4077.30]  Yeah, that's cool.
[4077.32 --> 4077.70]  We actually have
[4077.70 --> 4078.26]  a lot of topics.
[4078.50 --> 4078.86]  Hello.
[4078.86 --> 4080.18]  Hey!
[4081.60 --> 4082.00]  What's up?
[4082.88 --> 4083.72]  It works again.
[4084.36 --> 4084.88]  This is Whaler.
[4085.06 --> 4085.58]  Oh, hi Whaler.
[4086.10 --> 4086.42]  Hello.
[4087.60 --> 4088.44]  How's it going, man?
[4089.06 --> 4089.40]  Good.
[4089.60 --> 4090.24]  So what was it
[4090.24 --> 4090.86]  you wanted to ask
[4090.86 --> 4091.24]  me about?
[4092.48 --> 4093.48]  Well, two things.
[4093.88 --> 4094.54]  Update on the
[4094.54 --> 4095.10]  folding team
[4095.10 --> 4095.72]  and how your
[4095.72 --> 4096.30]  computer's coming
[4096.30 --> 4096.52]  along.
[4097.86 --> 4098.56]  Folding team's
[4098.56 --> 4099.06]  doing well.
[4099.06 --> 4100.70]  I think we just
[4100.70 --> 4103.28]  broke the 120th
[4103.28 --> 4104.26]  spot overall
[4104.26 --> 4105.90]  so we're expecting
[4105.90 --> 4107.18]  to break 100
[4107.18 --> 4108.66]  in probably late
[4108.66 --> 4109.20]  August.
[4109.98 --> 4110.46]  Wow.
[4111.82 --> 4113.24]  Yeah, my 500k
[4113.24 --> 4114.32]  a day is helping
[4114.32 --> 4114.90]  to push that
[4114.90 --> 4115.16]  through.
[4116.74 --> 4117.94]  I just got the
[4117.94 --> 4119.58]  24 core server
[4119.58 --> 4120.18]  up and running
[4120.18 --> 4120.78]  along with the
[4120.78 --> 4121.92]  32 core server
[4121.92 --> 4122.54]  so they're both
[4122.54 --> 4123.04]  coming along
[4123.04 --> 4123.88]  in the crawl space.
[4124.12 --> 4124.86]  I think the real
[4124.86 --> 4125.52]  question that we
[4125.52 --> 4126.08]  should be asking
[4126.08 --> 4126.90]  you is why that
[4126.90 --> 4127.42]  one has only
[4127.42 --> 4128.14]  24 cores.
[4130.20 --> 4130.68]  Price.
[4130.68 --> 4133.98]  the 8000 series
[4133.98 --> 4135.06]  24 cores are
[4135.06 --> 4136.02]  quite a bit
[4136.02 --> 4136.74]  cheaper than
[4136.74 --> 4137.52]  the newer
[4137.52 --> 4139.22]  6000 G34s
[4139.22 --> 4140.90]  so $300 to
[4140.90 --> 4141.90]  $400 compared
[4141.90 --> 4142.66]  to $1,500.
[4143.66 --> 4144.48]  All right, I guess
[4144.48 --> 4145.06]  we'll let it slide
[4145.06 --> 4145.46]  this time.
[4145.60 --> 4146.18]  Okay, okay.
[4146.26 --> 4146.50]  Thanks.
[4146.50 --> 4147.66]  Lonnie, you need
[4147.66 --> 4148.06]  to remember.
[4148.18 --> 4148.98]  And then, yeah,
[4149.04 --> 4149.96]  actually my main
[4149.96 --> 4151.02]  system, it just
[4151.02 --> 4151.70]  got it up and
[4151.70 --> 4152.42]  running now and
[4152.42 --> 4153.16]  had to reinstall
[4153.16 --> 4153.96]  Razor columns
[4153.96 --> 4154.58]  but it's up and
[4154.58 --> 4154.82]  running.
[4155.30 --> 4155.76]  I got the
[4155.76 --> 4157.04]  Aqualius, the
[4157.04 --> 4157.80]  Aqua computer
[4157.80 --> 4159.68]  Aqualius reservoir
[4159.68 --> 4160.44]  running in it
[4160.44 --> 4161.98]  with the new
[4161.98 --> 4163.72]  UV reactant tubing
[4163.72 --> 4164.94]  and coolant and
[4164.94 --> 4165.16]  everything.
[4165.30 --> 4165.72]  So yeah, I'll be
[4165.72 --> 4166.62]  updating my build
[4166.62 --> 4167.30]  blog on a forum
[4167.30 --> 4167.94]  with some pictures
[4167.94 --> 4168.82]  and a review of
[4168.82 --> 4169.68]  that reservoir and
[4169.68 --> 4169.90]  everything.
[4170.10 --> 4172.02]  It's an amazing
[4172.02 --> 4173.28]  quality reservoir.
[4173.72 --> 4174.26]  How much does
[4174.26 --> 4174.82]  it weigh again?
[4175.88 --> 4176.52]  The reservoir
[4176.52 --> 4177.44]  itself weighs in
[4177.44 --> 4178.82]  about 1.2 kilos
[4178.82 --> 4179.90]  but that's empty
[4179.90 --> 4181.10]  with it full of
[4181.10 --> 4181.86]  fluid, it's probably
[4181.86 --> 4183.08]  closer to 2 kilos.
[4183.90 --> 4184.84]  So I actually had
[4184.84 --> 4186.46]  to drill into my
[4186.46 --> 4188.38]  framing on my
[4188.38 --> 4190.12]  Switch 810 and
[4190.12 --> 4191.02]  there's four bolts
[4191.02 --> 4191.86]  holding it in.
[4192.18 --> 4193.42]  It's that heavy.
[4194.50 --> 4195.68]  But it's a solid,
[4195.82 --> 4197.12]  it's a 450 mil
[4197.12 --> 4199.50]  reservoir with a,
[4200.08 --> 4200.70]  what do they call
[4200.70 --> 4201.42]  it, a baro-rite
[4201.42 --> 4203.38]  glass reservoir,
[4204.04 --> 4205.44]  5 millimeters thick
[4205.44 --> 4206.86]  glass and they
[4206.86 --> 4207.92]  call it, what is
[4207.92 --> 4208.86]  it, derillion
[4208.86 --> 4210.42]  base and top.
[4210.56 --> 4212.46]  So it's very high
[4212.46 --> 4213.42]  quality and it's
[4213.42 --> 4214.46]  basically made so
[4214.46 --> 4215.70]  that I can fold on
[4215.70 --> 4216.54]  my gaming system
[4216.54 --> 4218.66]  724 where my water
[4218.66 --> 4219.66]  temperature gets in
[4219.66 --> 4220.94]  excess of 60 degrees
[4220.94 --> 4222.32]  and won't melt the
[4222.32 --> 4223.24]  acrylic that it was
[4223.24 --> 4225.30]  on other reservoirs.
[4227.26 --> 4228.18]  You are too
[4228.18 --> 4228.84]  hardcore, man.
[4228.86 --> 4229.68]  That's why I'm
[4229.68 --> 4230.34]  excited for this
[4230.34 --> 4230.86]  build blog.
[4231.42 --> 4232.12]  It's going to be
[4232.12 --> 4232.62]  awesome.
[4233.58 --> 4233.78]  Yeah.
[4235.10 --> 4236.20]  Oh man, that's a
[4236.20 --> 4236.60]  beast computer.
[4236.86 --> 4237.48]  I heard Windspeed
[4237.48 --> 4238.06]  chime in and say
[4238.06 --> 4238.82]  that Linus had to
[4238.82 --> 4239.34]  remember something.
[4239.44 --> 4239.82]  I don't remember
[4239.82 --> 4240.38]  what that was.
[4241.18 --> 4241.98]  No, when Linus
[4241.98 --> 4243.82]  was asking why
[4243.82 --> 4245.44]  the 36 core.
[4245.44 --> 4246.76]  You need to remember
[4246.76 --> 4247.98]  he's married and
[4247.98 --> 4248.64]  that everything has
[4248.64 --> 4249.32]  to be approved by
[4249.32 --> 4249.70]  the wife.
[4249.70 --> 4251.38]  I think the real
[4251.38 --> 4252.44]  question here is how
[4252.44 --> 4253.78]  he gets a 24 core
[4253.78 --> 4254.48]  approved by the
[4254.48 --> 4254.70]  wife.
[4254.80 --> 4255.94]  Never mind why he
[4255.94 --> 4257.10]  can't get a 32 core
[4257.10 --> 4257.74]  approved by the
[4257.74 --> 4258.04]  wife.
[4259.48 --> 4261.08]  It's a little deal
[4261.08 --> 4262.48]  that the wife and I
[4262.48 --> 4262.90]  have.
[4263.34 --> 4265.44]  You know, as I sell
[4265.44 --> 4266.58]  computer stuff, I can
[4266.58 --> 4267.92]  buy computer stuff and
[4267.92 --> 4269.00]  have my own account for
[4269.00 --> 4269.30]  that.
[4269.44 --> 4270.44]  And what goes into
[4270.44 --> 4271.04]  that and what comes
[4271.04 --> 4272.00]  out of that, she
[4272.00 --> 4273.26]  doesn't mind as long
[4273.26 --> 4274.52]  as I don't touch the
[4274.52 --> 4275.42]  main account.
[4275.42 --> 4277.58]  That's not a bad
[4277.58 --> 4277.90]  system.
[4277.96 --> 4278.34]  That's not a bad
[4278.34 --> 4278.62]  system.
[4278.94 --> 4279.10]  Yeah.
[4279.32 --> 4280.32]  He's done well for
[4280.32 --> 4280.64]  himself.
[4280.94 --> 4282.78]  And most people
[4282.78 --> 4283.86]  don't probably realize
[4283.86 --> 4284.82]  I've been married now
[4284.82 --> 4285.98]  for 15 years.
[4286.14 --> 4287.98]  So, you know, you
[4287.98 --> 4288.94]  work these things out.
[4292.60 --> 4293.62]  Wise words, I would
[4293.62 --> 4293.78]  say.
[4294.74 --> 4295.14]  Okay.
[4295.20 --> 4295.90]  Do we have another
[4295.90 --> 4296.68]  live viewer caller?
[4297.82 --> 4298.66]  We might.
[4298.82 --> 4300.12]  I'm just chatting with
[4300.12 --> 4301.14]  one guy now trying to
[4301.14 --> 4301.60]  figure out what he
[4301.60 --> 4302.36]  wants to talk about.
[4302.86 --> 4303.30]  All right.
[4303.36 --> 4303.58]  Sweet.
[4303.92 --> 4304.30]  Why don't we do
[4304.30 --> 4305.08]  another topic in the
[4305.08 --> 4305.32]  meantime?
[4305.54 --> 4305.74]  Yeah.
[4305.90 --> 4306.62]  This is something that
[4306.62 --> 4307.54]  we actually meant to
[4307.54 --> 4309.38]  do the other week.
[4310.36 --> 4312.44]  AMD 7970 Lego Edition.
[4312.82 --> 4313.84]  This was posted on the
[4313.84 --> 4314.92]  forum by QWERTY
[4314.92 --> 4315.24]  Warrior.
[4316.60 --> 4317.32]  Check this out.
[4317.64 --> 4319.38]  How real does this
[4319.38 --> 4319.92]  thing look?
[4320.42 --> 4321.26]  It's actually really,
[4321.44 --> 4321.98]  really well done.
[4322.00 --> 4323.00]  That graphics card.
[4323.26 --> 4324.42]  Not only does it look
[4324.42 --> 4325.36]  like a graphics card
[4325.36 --> 4326.68]  from the outside, a
[4326.68 --> 4328.20]  7970 gigahertz edition,
[4328.52 --> 4330.62]  but also it completely
[4330.62 --> 4332.24]  disassembles in different
[4332.24 --> 4333.28]  pieces for the heat
[4333.28 --> 4333.54]  sink.
[4333.66 --> 4334.22]  There's the aluminum
[4334.22 --> 4334.78]  heat sink.
[4334.78 --> 4335.96]  As well as the
[4335.96 --> 4337.52]  outer shroud and the
[4337.52 --> 4337.86]  fan.
[4338.40 --> 4339.00]  So there are the
[4339.00 --> 4340.08]  memory modules as
[4340.08 --> 4341.10]  well as the VRM,
[4341.52 --> 4342.70]  PCI Express connectors,
[4343.04 --> 4344.62]  and the GPU itself.
[4344.90 --> 4345.94]  Looks absolutely
[4345.94 --> 4346.54]  outstanding.
[4347.04 --> 4348.18]  But I think the real
[4348.18 --> 4348.92]  question that we all
[4348.92 --> 4350.18]  have to ask ourselves
[4350.18 --> 4351.52]  is can it run
[4351.52 --> 4352.10]  Lego Crisis?
[4352.10 --> 4352.28]  Yes.
[4352.28 --> 4356.10]  they should make Lego
[4356.10 --> 4356.44]  Crisis.
[4356.44 --> 4357.24]  They should totally make
[4357.24 --> 4357.68]  Lego Crisis.
[4357.68 --> 4358.62]  They have Lego like
[4358.62 --> 4359.30]  everything else.
[4359.38 --> 4359.88]  They should make Lego
[4359.88 --> 4360.22]  Crisis.
[4360.84 --> 4361.70]  It's like the one thing
[4361.70 --> 4362.80]  about Crisis that's unique
[4362.80 --> 4363.56]  is the fact that it's
[4363.56 --> 4364.40]  graphically demanding.
[4364.72 --> 4365.26]  And now you're going to
[4365.26 --> 4365.98]  make it a Lego game?
[4366.20 --> 4367.16]  It'll be fantastic.
[4367.62 --> 4368.22]  It's like how many
[4368.22 --> 4369.46]  polygons per screen?
[4370.02 --> 4370.90]  It's like 12.
[4372.80 --> 4373.78]  Why even bother?
[4373.78 --> 4381.38]  Of all the pointless
[4381.38 --> 4381.96]  ideas.
[4383.44 --> 4384.08]  Lego Crisis.
[4384.52 --> 4385.90]  Someone says bad joke is
[4385.90 --> 4387.20]  bad on Twitch chat.
[4387.62 --> 4388.84]  What bad joke is bad?
[4389.22 --> 4390.02]  Oh, but can't run
[4390.02 --> 4390.64]  Lego Crisis?
[4390.80 --> 4391.40]  Yeah, probably.
[4391.64 --> 4392.36]  Now I'm sad.
[4393.68 --> 4394.80]  It's got to go on your
[4394.80 --> 4395.58]  jokes channel.
[4396.10 --> 4396.74]  I know.
[4396.86 --> 4397.60]  I should totally have
[4397.60 --> 4398.10]  a jokes channel.
[4398.52 --> 4399.56]  Speaking of jokes channel,
[4400.08 --> 4400.72]  while we're waiting for
[4400.72 --> 4401.64]  that caller, guys, just
[4401.64 --> 4402.66]  interrupt any time if
[4402.66 --> 4403.18]  the caller's here.
[4404.16 --> 4405.44]  But I tweeted out the
[4405.44 --> 4407.10]  other day asking if
[4407.10 --> 4410.20]  people would object to
[4410.20 --> 4411.40]  us having two daily
[4411.40 --> 4412.66]  videos as opposed to
[4412.66 --> 4413.56]  one daily video.
[4414.26 --> 4415.34]  And I had some people
[4415.34 --> 4416.42]  asking what kind of a
[4416.42 --> 4417.32]  format would there be
[4417.32 --> 4418.96]  for the second daily
[4418.96 --> 4419.34]  video?
[4419.68 --> 4420.66]  And I didn't really
[4420.66 --> 4421.70]  answer that on Twitter
[4421.70 --> 4423.32]  because I think there
[4423.32 --> 4424.12]  was still some internal
[4424.12 --> 4424.96]  discussion to be had.
[4424.96 --> 4425.84]  But what we think it
[4425.84 --> 4427.22]  would look like would
[4427.22 --> 4428.70]  be something like a
[4428.70 --> 4431.10]  very quick truncated
[4431.10 --> 4431.86]  version of the
[4431.86 --> 4432.24]  live stream.
[4432.76 --> 4434.08]  So instead of being
[4434.08 --> 4434.68]  everything that's
[4434.68 --> 4436.04]  happened that week with
[4436.04 --> 4436.80]  a whole lot of
[4436.80 --> 4440.54]  analysis and discussion
[4440.54 --> 4442.40]  and two hosts, it
[4442.40 --> 4443.58]  would just be what
[4443.58 --> 4445.32]  happened today as
[4445.32 --> 4446.46]  quickly as possible.
[4447.24 --> 4448.70]  And I think Linus
[4448.70 --> 4449.38]  Tech Tips is the
[4449.38 --> 4450.40]  appropriate channel for
[4450.40 --> 4450.58]  it.
[4451.88 --> 4454.94]  But I don't know.
[4454.96 --> 4457.32]  would love to hear
[4457.32 --> 4458.70]  your feedback in the
[4458.70 --> 4459.20]  Twitch chat.
[4462.60 --> 4463.92]  But yeah, let me know
[4463.92 --> 4464.50]  what you guys think.
[4465.22 --> 4465.66]  Someone's like
[4465.66 --> 4466.22]  Fap News.
[4467.30 --> 4468.32]  Not Fap News.
[4469.02 --> 4470.88]  Fast as possible news.
[4471.16 --> 4471.78]  They're totally
[4471.78 --> 4472.22]  different.
[4473.18 --> 4473.78]  That's true.
[4475.52 --> 4476.68]  Looks like everyone's
[4476.68 --> 4476.94]  down.
[4477.28 --> 4477.94]  Looks like everyone's
[4477.94 --> 4478.18]  down.
[4478.40 --> 4479.16]  But I mean, that's the
[4479.16 --> 4480.18]  problem with taking
[4480.18 --> 4482.62]  feedback from sort of
[4482.62 --> 4486.16]  the most enthusiastic
[4486.16 --> 4487.14]  of your audience.
[4487.36 --> 4488.14]  The guys who are
[4488.14 --> 4489.14]  actually tuned in here
[4489.14 --> 4489.52]  live.
[4490.32 --> 4492.48]  Like, you know,
[4492.52 --> 4493.62]  three and a half hours
[4493.62 --> 4494.66]  into us streaming.
[4495.30 --> 4496.22]  Which, by the way, we
[4496.22 --> 4497.10]  appreciate very much,
[4497.16 --> 4497.32]  guys.
[4497.36 --> 4497.96]  You guys are awesome.
[4497.96 --> 4498.98]  And speaking of this
[4498.98 --> 4499.90]  stream, I want to give
[4499.90 --> 4501.64]  a, like, a shout out
[4501.64 --> 4502.24]  to the mods.
[4502.80 --> 4504.32]  I've moved a bunch of
[4504.32 --> 4505.06]  the Intel Response
[4505.06 --> 4506.82]  team, actually, in here
[4506.82 --> 4507.32]  as mods.
[4507.42 --> 4508.70]  We've got a mod that is
[4508.70 --> 4509.74]  a big guy on the
[4509.74 --> 4510.46]  Day9 stream.
[4510.70 --> 4511.46]  He's a mod there.
[4511.64 --> 4511.80]  Oh.
[4512.72 --> 4513.78]  And we have all of
[4513.78 --> 4514.44]  our forum mods.
[4514.56 --> 4515.48]  And, like, the Twitch
[4515.48 --> 4516.88]  mods is a much better,
[4517.00 --> 4518.78]  much better, bigger group
[4518.78 --> 4519.70]  now than it was.
[4519.88 --> 4521.06]  And I have been seeing
[4521.06 --> 4522.60]  stuff that I was like,
[4522.66 --> 4523.22]  oh, that should probably
[4523.22 --> 4523.66]  get removed.
[4523.74 --> 4524.62]  And the second that
[4524.62 --> 4525.46]  thought passes through
[4525.46 --> 4526.20]  my mind, it's gone.
[4526.20 --> 4527.16]  Wow.
[4527.30 --> 4528.62]  So I'm actually quite
[4528.62 --> 4529.48]  happy with how they're
[4529.48 --> 4529.70]  doing.
[4530.06 --> 4530.94]  Someone asked, kind of
[4530.94 --> 4531.94]  like 90 Seconds on the
[4531.94 --> 4532.24]  Verge.
[4533.08 --> 4534.82]  Similar, but probably
[4534.82 --> 4535.48]  less slick.
[4535.96 --> 4537.56]  So more just, like,
[4537.64 --> 4538.60]  hey, quick, here,
[4538.88 --> 4539.68]  here's a web page.
[4540.00 --> 4540.78]  This is something that
[4540.78 --> 4541.58]  I've been toying around
[4541.58 --> 4542.46]  with actually since
[4542.46 --> 4543.32]  before they started
[4543.32 --> 4544.44]  doing 90 Seconds on the
[4544.44 --> 4545.10]  Verge, which makes me
[4545.10 --> 4546.08]  look like a copycat.
[4546.60 --> 4548.48]  But, I mean, it would
[4548.48 --> 4549.58]  be just a matter of
[4549.58 --> 4550.76]  what kind of a style
[4550.76 --> 4551.16]  you want.
[4551.22 --> 4551.90]  Because I think a lot
[4551.90 --> 4552.96]  of people will like
[4552.96 --> 4553.70]  the Verge's style.
[4553.98 --> 4554.94]  And I personally like
[4554.94 --> 4555.58]  the Verge's style.
[4555.58 --> 4556.38]  I have no complaints
[4556.38 --> 4557.10]  about the way they do
[4557.10 --> 4557.42]  things.
[4557.54 --> 4558.50]  But they don't always
[4558.50 --> 4559.36]  look at the same kind
[4559.36 --> 4560.10]  of stuff that we do.
[4560.30 --> 4561.20]  Like, I read an article
[4561.20 --> 4561.98]  on the Verge a little
[4561.98 --> 4563.20]  while ago that was
[4563.20 --> 4564.26]  like, I was like,
[4564.32 --> 4565.74]  oh, you guys, I love
[4565.74 --> 4566.70]  you, but man, you're
[4566.70 --> 4567.20]  so mainstream.
[4567.66 --> 4568.70]  I forget what it was,
[4568.74 --> 4569.88]  but it was like, um,
[4570.90 --> 4571.32]  they were saying
[4571.32 --> 4572.08]  something was like the
[4572.08 --> 4572.72]  newest thing ever,
[4572.80 --> 4573.36]  and it just totally
[4573.36 --> 4573.76]  wasn't.
[4574.02 --> 4575.34]  If you're anywhere new.
[4575.38 --> 4576.14]  It was on a previous
[4576.14 --> 4576.68]  live stream.
[4576.76 --> 4577.38]  I can't remember what
[4577.38 --> 4577.76]  it was.
[4578.30 --> 4579.24]  And I think that...
[4579.24 --> 4579.34]  Do you need the
[4579.34 --> 4580.34]  DirectX 11s?
[4580.58 --> 4581.34]  Does your laptop have
[4581.34 --> 4582.24]  the DirectX 11s?
[4582.42 --> 4583.48]  No, no, that was a
[4583.48 --> 4583.92]  different thing.
[4583.92 --> 4586.30]  That was part of
[4586.30 --> 4588.76]  CNET's offshoot thing.
[4588.76 --> 4589.58]  But this laptop has
[4589.58 --> 4590.76]  the DirectX 11s.
[4590.76 --> 4591.34]  So it should play
[4591.34 --> 4591.96]  all the latest games.
[4592.04 --> 4593.32]  It's like, guys who
[4593.32 --> 4594.52]  are super technical,
[4595.20 --> 4596.06]  but might be more
[4596.06 --> 4596.90]  technical about
[4596.90 --> 4598.10]  programming, or
[4598.10 --> 4599.54]  security, or
[4599.54 --> 4600.98]  console, or
[4600.98 --> 4602.38]  something, where they
[4602.38 --> 4602.90]  don't actually
[4602.90 --> 4604.14]  necessarily have that
[4604.14 --> 4606.00]  PC perspective.
[4606.40 --> 4607.68]  So that's what I
[4607.68 --> 4608.30]  think we bring to the
[4608.30 --> 4608.98]  table that's a little
[4608.98 --> 4609.38]  bit different.
[4609.38 --> 4614.14]  Someone says,
[4614.22 --> 4615.12]  Linus, my OCD is
[4615.12 --> 4615.78]  driving me crazy
[4615.78 --> 4616.32]  because of your
[4616.32 --> 4616.54]  hair.
[4616.80 --> 4617.22]  Yeah, my hair's
[4617.22 --> 4617.50]  terrible.
[4617.88 --> 4618.48]  Part of the problem
[4618.48 --> 4619.04]  is we're in the
[4619.04 --> 4619.84]  middle of filming a
[4619.84 --> 4620.56]  really long build
[4620.56 --> 4622.20]  guide, and if I cut
[4622.20 --> 4623.50]  my hair now, that's
[4623.50 --> 4623.96]  going to be a bit of
[4623.96 --> 4624.84]  a continuity problem.
[4625.58 --> 4626.60]  So I'm just putting
[4626.60 --> 4627.26]  off cutting it.
[4627.74 --> 4628.20]  We should wait
[4628.20 --> 4628.90]  like three weeks,
[4628.98 --> 4629.68]  then you should
[4629.68 --> 4630.40]  continue filming.
[4631.22 --> 4631.84]  So you can have
[4631.84 --> 4632.94]  randomly super long hair.
[4632.94 --> 4633.58]  No, I really need
[4633.58 --> 4634.12]  to get that done.
[4634.72 --> 4635.16]  You know what?
[4635.22 --> 4635.76]  Maybe I should just
[4635.76 --> 4636.08]  cut it.
[4636.08 --> 4637.24]  And it should just
[4637.24 --> 4638.44]  randomly be cut in
[4638.44 --> 4639.66]  between two shots.
[4639.88 --> 4640.40]  Just deal with it.
[4640.44 --> 4640.96]  It'd be hilarious.
[4642.02 --> 4642.94]  I've actually done
[4642.94 --> 4643.18]  that.
[4643.44 --> 4644.30]  You should try to
[4644.30 --> 4646.10]  film ahead of it so
[4646.10 --> 4647.02]  that it gets short
[4647.02 --> 4647.88]  and then gets long
[4647.88 --> 4648.16]  again.
[4649.20 --> 4652.26]  That'd be awesome.
[4653.76 --> 4654.22]  Someone says,
[4654.30 --> 4654.86]  speaking of PC
[4654.86 --> 4655.58]  perspective, bring
[4655.58 --> 4656.22]  Ryan Schrode on
[4656.22 --> 4656.58]  the stream.
[4656.92 --> 4657.82]  We will definitely
[4657.82 --> 4658.62]  bring Ryan Schrode
[4658.62 --> 4659.64]  on the stream, but I
[4659.64 --> 4660.36]  think next time we
[4660.36 --> 4661.36]  bring him on, we're
[4661.36 --> 4662.56]  probably going to try
[4662.56 --> 4663.48]  to figure out a video
[4663.48 --> 4664.68]  calling solution before
[4664.68 --> 4665.02]  that.
[4665.02 --> 4665.78]  Because I think
[4665.78 --> 4667.00]  particularly the things
[4667.00 --> 4667.82]  that he wants to talk
[4667.82 --> 4668.90]  about often require
[4668.90 --> 4670.32]  illustration, whereas
[4670.32 --> 4671.16]  some of our other
[4671.16 --> 4672.56]  guests, such as
[4672.56 --> 4674.04]  Logan today, it can be
[4674.04 --> 4676.14]  done very audibly as
[4676.14 --> 4676.94]  opposed to requiring
[4676.94 --> 4677.30]  video.
[4677.40 --> 4678.06]  Are you really going to
[4678.06 --> 4678.74]  go buy ice cream?
[4679.08 --> 4680.08]  It's so expensive.
[4680.26 --> 4680.90]  What's wrong with you?
[4680.94 --> 4681.70]  You can buy an entire
[4681.70 --> 4682.76]  bucket of ice cream for
[4682.76 --> 4683.54]  the price of one.
[4683.58 --> 4683.86]  I don't even want to
[4683.86 --> 4685.14]  necessarily buy the
[4685.14 --> 4685.48]  ice cream.
[4685.54 --> 4686.02]  I just want to run
[4686.02 --> 4686.62]  after the truck.
[4688.04 --> 4688.58]  That's worse.
[4690.38 --> 4691.18]  I mean, at least it
[4691.18 --> 4692.02]  costs nothing other
[4692.02 --> 4692.66]  to your dignity.
[4692.86 --> 4693.34]  I don't even have
[4693.34 --> 4693.70]  coins.
[4693.70 --> 4694.58]  I mean, what will
[4694.58 --> 4696.68]  all the chicks think?
[4697.58 --> 4697.90]  I don't know.
[4697.94 --> 4698.60]  Whatever kids care
[4698.60 --> 4699.18]  about these days, I
[4699.18 --> 4699.38]  don't know.
[4700.78 --> 4701.44]  I'm so old.
[4702.22 --> 4702.64]  Swag.
[4703.22 --> 4703.90]  Yolo swag.
[4704.56 --> 4704.96]  420.
[4705.18 --> 4705.66]  Do you have the
[4705.66 --> 4706.24]  Yolo swag?
[4706.64 --> 4707.04]  Hashtag.
[4707.42 --> 4708.12]  Then you can't have
[4708.12 --> 4709.56]  the females, or
[4709.56 --> 4710.30]  whatever they call
[4710.30 --> 4710.86]  them nowadays.
[4711.72 --> 4712.48]  I'm pretty sure
[4712.48 --> 4714.04]  they're called
[4714.04 --> 4714.86]  females, and they'll
[4714.86 --> 4715.58]  continue to be called
[4715.58 --> 4715.86]  females.
[4715.86 --> 4718.32]  I don't have the
[4718.32 --> 4718.92]  Yolo swag.
[4719.80 --> 4720.64]  420 hashtag
[4720.64 --> 4721.10]  smoke it.
[4722.10 --> 4722.94]  I don't have that.
[4724.40 --> 4725.08]  I can't get the
[4725.08 --> 4725.50]  women's.
[4725.86 --> 4727.04]  Speaking of Yolo swag,
[4727.72 --> 4728.82]  as big as our live
[4728.82 --> 4730.52]  stream happens to be,
[4730.78 --> 4731.36]  where we're getting
[4731.36 --> 4732.38]  like 4,000 viewers,
[4732.48 --> 4733.78]  which is awesome, I
[4733.78 --> 4734.76]  just found out that
[4734.76 --> 4735.50]  this week in tech,
[4735.60 --> 4737.10]  twit.tv, they peaked
[4737.10 --> 4739.80]  at 250,000 live
[4739.80 --> 4740.10]  viewers.
[4740.20 --> 4740.78]  That's a new record
[4740.78 --> 4741.32]  for them during
[4741.32 --> 4742.02]  WWDC.
[4742.02 --> 4743.90]  Isn't that crazy?
[4744.94 --> 4746.00]  That's live viewers.
[4746.94 --> 4748.10]  Every podcast they
[4748.10 --> 4749.06]  upload gets like
[4749.06 --> 4750.08]  300,000 downloads.
[4750.90 --> 4751.84]  I was looking into
[4751.84 --> 4752.22]  that.
[4752.46 --> 4753.24]  I can't find his
[4753.24 --> 4754.42]  other metrics, but
[4754.42 --> 4755.64]  that one dude that
[4755.64 --> 4757.22]  you and Ed's always...
[4757.22 --> 4757.70]  Leo Laporte?
[4757.90 --> 4758.14]  Yeah.
[4758.56 --> 4759.28]  I think it's like at
[4759.28 --> 4760.24]  least 20% of his
[4760.24 --> 4760.94]  Twitter followers are
[4760.94 --> 4761.16]  fake.
[4761.84 --> 4762.24]  20%.
[4762.24 --> 4763.90]  But he's got like
[4763.90 --> 4765.10]  400,000 or
[4765.10 --> 4765.72]  something like that.
[4765.84 --> 4766.44]  So that means he
[4766.44 --> 4767.46]  still has 300,000
[4767.46 --> 4767.80]  followers.
[4768.32 --> 4769.84]  And probably 20% of
[4769.84 --> 4770.38]  mine are fake.
[4771.12 --> 4771.42]  Yeah.
[4771.42 --> 4772.32]  I wanted to look
[4772.32 --> 4773.26]  into it more because
[4773.26 --> 4774.36]  it was actually him
[4774.36 --> 4775.26]  talking about it.
[4775.96 --> 4776.38]  It's almost like
[4776.38 --> 4777.16]  twit, the two hour
[4777.16 --> 4777.76]  long ad.
[4778.96 --> 4779.50]  I don't...
[4779.50 --> 4780.10]  That's...
[4780.10 --> 4781.04]  I don't actually do
[4781.04 --> 4781.82]  that much advertising.
[4782.02 --> 4782.92]  Diesel listens to it
[4782.92 --> 4784.06]  behind me all day.
[4784.80 --> 4785.64]  I listen to it.
[4785.70 --> 4786.74]  Diesel listens to it
[4786.74 --> 4787.24]  behind me.
[4787.26 --> 4787.28]  It's because you can't
[4787.28 --> 4788.36]  tell what's advertising
[4788.36 --> 4789.00]  what's not.
[4789.98 --> 4790.46]  You think so?
[4790.84 --> 4791.24]  Yeah.
[4791.78 --> 4792.88]  All I ever hear come
[4792.88 --> 4793.26]  out of there is
[4793.26 --> 4793.70]  advertising.
[4794.58 --> 4795.54]  It's a ton of
[4795.54 --> 4795.94]  advertising.
[4796.20 --> 4796.96]  And I actually don't
[4796.96 --> 4797.58]  think that many people
[4797.58 --> 4798.14]  are watching it.
[4798.28 --> 4798.90]  I'm wondering what's
[4798.90 --> 4799.56]  up with those metrics.
[4800.28 --> 4801.02]  I'm wondering if
[4801.02 --> 4801.88]  they're streaming it
[4801.88 --> 4802.42]  to a room.
[4802.86 --> 4804.32]  Or if a TV station
[4804.32 --> 4805.08]  is porting it or
[4805.08 --> 4805.36]  something.
[4805.36 --> 4806.42]  And then they're
[4806.42 --> 4808.00]  using that metric to
[4808.00 --> 4808.92]  skew it in some
[4808.92 --> 4809.84]  crazy funky math.
[4810.92 --> 4812.00]  Or if something's
[4812.00 --> 4812.50]  going on.
[4812.64 --> 4812.90]  I don't know.
[4812.90 --> 4813.10]  But okay.
[4813.38 --> 4814.18]  Look at it this way.
[4815.36 --> 4816.66]  50,000 people.
[4817.06 --> 4818.04]  We're rounding up
[4818.04 --> 4818.82]  because we like
[4818.82 --> 4819.30]  rounding up.
[4819.34 --> 4819.82]  It makes us feel
[4819.82 --> 4820.02]  good.
[4821.22 --> 4822.36]  So let's say 40,000
[4822.36 --> 4824.34]  people watched the
[4824.34 --> 4825.12]  live stream archive,
[4825.36 --> 4825.92]  the WAN show
[4825.92 --> 4827.28]  archive on YouTube.
[4827.28 --> 4829.50]  But you said the
[4829.50 --> 4829.98]  stream.
[4830.44 --> 4831.10]  So are you saying
[4831.10 --> 4832.60]  watching it afterwards
[4832.60 --> 4833.44]  or watching it during?
[4834.50 --> 4835.80]  300,000 downloads.
[4836.14 --> 4836.32]  Okay.
[4836.40 --> 4836.82]  That's more
[4836.82 --> 4837.12]  believable.
[4837.16 --> 4837.52]  When we were
[4837.52 --> 4838.00]  looking at their
[4838.00 --> 4838.50]  Twitch thing,
[4839.06 --> 4839.58]  it was like
[4839.58 --> 4840.00]  terrible.
[4840.48 --> 4840.80]  Yeah.
[4841.18 --> 4841.98]  200 people or
[4841.98 --> 4842.10]  something like that.
[4842.10 --> 4842.96]  See, that's way
[4842.96 --> 4843.44]  more believable.
[4843.66 --> 4844.42]  I thought you were
[4844.42 --> 4845.20]  saying they had like
[4845.20 --> 4846.16]  300,000 people
[4846.16 --> 4846.72]  watching live.
[4846.80 --> 4847.18]  I'm like, no.
[4847.18 --> 4847.36]  No.
[4847.54 --> 4847.66]  No.
[4848.06 --> 4849.64]  250,000 live was
[4849.64 --> 4850.64]  their peak during
[4850.64 --> 4851.44]  WWDC.
[4851.60 --> 4852.14]  That was a record.
[4852.28 --> 4852.88]  But then that kind
[4852.88 --> 4853.56]  of makes sense too.
[4853.86 --> 4854.10]  Yes.
[4854.10 --> 4854.60]  Because they're
[4854.60 --> 4855.52]  probably streaming
[4855.52 --> 4856.14]  to something.
[4856.42 --> 4858.14]  So 300,000 people
[4858.14 --> 4859.26]  per episode
[4859.26 --> 4860.68]  are downloading it.
[4861.10 --> 4861.66]  And to me,
[4861.70 --> 4862.52]  that's very believable
[4862.52 --> 4864.00]  because the WAN show
[4864.00 --> 4865.16]  gets around 40,000
[4865.16 --> 4865.92]  views of the archive.
[4866.38 --> 4867.70]  I have 40,000
[4867.70 --> 4868.58]  followers on Twitter.
[4869.18 --> 4870.36]  So if I was doing
[4870.36 --> 4871.84]  10x that
[4871.84 --> 4872.62]  in terms of people
[4872.62 --> 4873.02]  downloading,
[4873.16 --> 4873.66]  then it sounds
[4873.66 --> 4874.02]  about right.
[4874.32 --> 4875.02]  And I think through
[4875.02 --> 4875.76]  iTunes you can have
[4875.76 --> 4876.56]  like auto-subscription
[4876.56 --> 4877.14]  downloads, right?
[4878.04 --> 4878.30]  Really?
[4878.66 --> 4879.20]  I think so.
[4879.26 --> 4879.40]  I don't know.
[4879.40 --> 4880.14]  We should really
[4880.14 --> 4881.04]  syndicate to iTunes.
[4881.54 --> 4882.16]  Why don't we do this?
[4882.16 --> 4882.56]  I think you can do that.
[4882.62 --> 4883.02]  Twitch chat.
[4883.08 --> 4883.56]  Can you do that?
[4883.56 --> 4884.28]  I don't use iTunes.
[4885.24 --> 4886.12]  Someone says I'm bored.
[4887.00 --> 4887.58]  I'm sorry,
[4887.68 --> 4888.38]  Lobster Shaver.
[4888.66 --> 4889.06]  By the way,
[4889.08 --> 4889.88]  that is a fantastic
[4889.88 --> 4890.44]  username.
[4892.24 --> 4892.60]  Yes.
[4892.86 --> 4893.60]  Someone says yes.
[4893.70 --> 4894.54]  I've seen one person
[4894.54 --> 4894.82]  answer.
[4894.94 --> 4895.36]  And someone says
[4895.36 --> 4895.90]  you should raise
[4895.90 --> 4896.44]  your ice cream.
[4896.56 --> 4897.38]  Yes, yes, yes.
[4897.46 --> 4897.94]  Okay, yeah.
[4898.42 --> 4899.20]  So apparently you can.
[4899.26 --> 4899.84]  So there might be
[4899.84 --> 4900.86]  a lot to do with that
[4900.86 --> 4902.80]  because if subscribers
[4902.80 --> 4903.56]  on YouTube...
[4904.20 --> 4904.96]  We're downloading
[4904.96 --> 4905.52]  the content.
[4905.58 --> 4906.08]  We're downloading
[4906.08 --> 4906.60]  the content.
[4906.72 --> 4907.12]  That doesn't mean
[4907.12 --> 4907.70]  they watched it.
[4907.72 --> 4908.68]  And it automatically
[4908.68 --> 4909.24]  downloads.
[4909.52 --> 4909.76]  Yes.
[4909.88 --> 4910.52]  You don't even
[4910.52 --> 4911.30]  automatically get the
[4911.30 --> 4911.98]  freaking video in your
[4911.98 --> 4912.62]  subscription box
[4912.62 --> 4913.28]  because it's broken
[4913.28 --> 4915.32]  87.9% of the time.
[4915.50 --> 4915.70]  Right.
[4918.02 --> 4918.42]  So.
[4920.68 --> 4921.16]  Interesting.
[4923.08 --> 4923.48]  Man.
[4923.84 --> 4924.38]  Do we have a color?
[4925.66 --> 4926.18]  I don't know.
[4926.18 --> 4929.72]  Do we have a color,
[4929.82 --> 4930.00]  guys?
[4930.04 --> 4930.56]  He's apparently
[4930.56 --> 4931.54]  still working on it.
[4932.14 --> 4932.68]  Apparently still
[4932.68 --> 4933.12]  working on it.
[4933.32 --> 4933.70]  Sweet.
[4934.90 --> 4935.86]  I am getting quite a few.
[4935.86 --> 4936.26]  Oh.
[4937.26 --> 4937.98]  I'm getting quite a few
[4937.98 --> 4939.16]  PMs here on Twitch
[4939.16 --> 4940.96]  about trying to
[4940.96 --> 4942.12]  actually get on the
[4942.12 --> 4942.36]  stream.
[4943.04 --> 4943.90]  Download Razer
[4943.90 --> 4944.24]  Coms.
[4944.30 --> 4944.92]  The link's in the
[4944.92 --> 4946.08]  description of the
[4946.08 --> 4946.34]  video.
[4946.84 --> 4947.64]  And search WAN
[4947.64 --> 4948.34]  Open in the
[4948.34 --> 4948.84]  groups tab.
[4949.36 --> 4950.12]  Links down there,
[4950.16 --> 4950.30]  yo.
[4951.22 --> 4952.24]  I think I started to
[4952.24 --> 4952.86]  explain it earlier
[4952.86 --> 4953.52]  and didn't finish.
[4953.52 --> 4955.52]  Yeah, dude,
[4955.62 --> 4956.44]  just group search
[4956.44 --> 4957.14]  for WAN Open
[4957.14 --> 4958.78]  and go to that
[4958.78 --> 4959.26]  Bailey link
[4959.26 --> 4959.88]  and you'll be good.
[4962.66 --> 4963.18]  Someone says,
[4963.28 --> 4963.92]  you all just lost
[4963.92 --> 4964.28]  the game.
[4965.26 --> 4965.68]  Someone says,
[4965.76 --> 4966.22]  I'm not bored,
[4966.32 --> 4966.64]  Linus.
[4967.02 --> 4967.54]  Thank you.
[4968.38 --> 4968.86]  Someone asks,
[4968.94 --> 4969.82]  are Arctic cooling
[4969.82 --> 4970.62]  aftermarket coolers
[4970.62 --> 4970.96]  any good?
[4971.80 --> 4972.46]  They used to be.
[4972.76 --> 4973.16]  Yeah.
[4973.72 --> 4974.40]  I don't think they're
[4974.40 --> 4974.94]  any worse than
[4974.94 --> 4975.48]  they used to be.
[4976.02 --> 4976.22]  But.
[4976.22 --> 4976.52]  But.
[4977.52 --> 4978.12]  They're just kind of
[4978.12 --> 4979.02]  irrelevant these days.
[4979.42 --> 4979.74]  Yeah,
[4979.88 --> 4980.36]  I was just going to
[4980.36 --> 4980.52]  say,
[4980.60 --> 4981.38]  how much you gain
[4981.38 --> 4981.84]  from them.
[4982.02 --> 4982.30]  They're not
[4982.30 --> 4983.00]  necessarily worse,
[4983.10 --> 4983.62]  but how much you
[4983.62 --> 4984.20]  gain from them,
[4984.22 --> 4984.50]  I think,
[4984.56 --> 4984.84]  is maybe.
[4984.90 --> 4985.24]  Disagree?
[4985.92 --> 4986.72]  Particularly on
[4986.72 --> 4987.40]  graphics cards,
[4987.52 --> 4988.14]  I think you gain
[4988.14 --> 4988.84]  more than ever
[4988.84 --> 4989.54]  from a good cooler.
[4990.30 --> 4991.24]  From a good cooler,
[4991.48 --> 4992.20]  but a lot of
[4992.20 --> 4993.52]  aftermarket graphics
[4993.52 --> 4994.10]  cards are coming
[4994.10 --> 4994.62]  with really good
[4994.62 --> 4995.16]  coolers on them
[4995.16 --> 4995.40]  already.
[4995.48 --> 4995.82]  That's true,
[4995.90 --> 4996.20]  so you could
[4996.20 --> 4996.76]  probably just buy
[4996.76 --> 4997.46]  a proper graphics
[4997.46 --> 4997.98]  card in the first
[4997.98 --> 4998.30]  place,
[4998.56 --> 4999.60]  which would have
[4999.60 --> 5000.28]  a better PCB
[5000.28 --> 5000.84]  design,
[5001.52 --> 5002.22]  better cooler.
[5002.88 --> 5003.80]  So just buy
[5003.80 --> 5004.48]  that card that
[5004.48 --> 5005.04]  already comes with
[5005.04 --> 5005.56]  a better cooler
[5005.56 --> 5006.46]  on it instead.
[5007.40 --> 5008.08]  That's what I meant
[5008.08 --> 5008.50]  by the,
[5008.50 --> 5009.02]  you're not getting
[5009.02 --> 5009.76]  the same difference
[5009.76 --> 5010.06]  anymore.
[5010.30 --> 5010.76]  Someone says
[5010.76 --> 5011.66]  Leo Laporte rocks,
[5011.72 --> 5012.26]  but there's no way
[5012.26 --> 5013.28]  300,000 per hour
[5013.28 --> 5013.78]  are watching him.
[5013.98 --> 5014.90]  I didn't say per hour,
[5015.40 --> 5017.04]  300,000 downloading
[5017.04 --> 5018.60]  the episodes.
[5019.20 --> 5020.00]  So whatever that
[5020.00 --> 5020.52]  actually means.
[5020.52 --> 5020.88]  That's what I
[5020.88 --> 5021.98]  didn't get out of
[5021.98 --> 5022.50]  that as well.
[5022.90 --> 5023.04]  So,
[5023.36 --> 5023.58]  yeah.
[5024.40 --> 5024.88]  It does kind of
[5024.88 --> 5025.74]  make sense now.
[5026.00 --> 5026.54]  Someone asks,
[5026.68 --> 5028.30]  when will MZXT
[5028.30 --> 5029.14]  release their GPU
[5029.14 --> 5029.40]  cooler?
[5029.50 --> 5030.16]  Hopefully soon,
[5030.20 --> 5030.90]  that thing's cool.
[5031.44 --> 5031.96]  So it allows you
[5031.96 --> 5032.72]  to take an Ace Attack
[5032.72 --> 5033.98]  cooler and hook that
[5033.98 --> 5034.92]  up to your video card
[5034.92 --> 5036.28]  and then like cool
[5036.28 --> 5036.92]  the rest of the card
[5036.92 --> 5037.92]  with like a 92mm
[5037.92 --> 5038.70]  fan is awesome.
[5038.86 --> 5039.50]  Or maybe it's an 80mm.
[5041.76 --> 5042.42]  I wonder how many
[5042.42 --> 5042.90]  people are still
[5042.90 --> 5043.24]  watching.
[5044.94 --> 5045.34]  2063?
[5045.72 --> 5046.44]  Holy crap!
[5047.94 --> 5048.24]  How about that?
[5048.24 --> 5048.62]  I did not buy
[5048.62 --> 5049.26]  Legendary Edition
[5049.26 --> 5049.84]  during the sale,
[5049.94 --> 5050.42]  I'm just going to
[5050.42 --> 5051.42]  grab the DLCs.
[5052.90 --> 5053.64]  It would be helpful
[5053.64 --> 5054.48]  if you told people
[5054.48 --> 5055.42]  what question you're
[5055.42 --> 5055.98]  responding to,
[5056.02 --> 5056.62]  because not everyone's
[5056.62 --> 5057.14]  in Twitch chat.
[5057.14 --> 5058.38]  Someone said,
[5058.46 --> 5058.96]  select you to buy
[5058.96 --> 5059.92]  Skyrim Legendary Edition
[5059.92 --> 5060.40]  during the sale.
[5060.48 --> 5060.96]  I already own it,
[5061.02 --> 5061.42]  so I'm just going to
[5061.42 --> 5062.12]  buy the DLCs.
[5062.18 --> 5062.98]  It is going to be
[5062.98 --> 5064.08]  on the next daily sale.
[5064.30 --> 5064.72]  Oh my god.
[5064.72 --> 5065.52]  Are you really going
[5065.52 --> 5066.50]  to talk about Skyrim
[5066.50 --> 5066.74]  again?
[5067.30 --> 5068.30]  I was answering a
[5068.30 --> 5068.96]  question and then
[5068.96 --> 5069.50]  I stopped.
[5069.62 --> 5070.72]  You selectively answered
[5070.72 --> 5071.82]  one Twitch question
[5071.82 --> 5072.48]  in like the last
[5072.48 --> 5073.82]  20 minutes about
[5073.82 --> 5074.16]  Skyrim.
[5074.16 --> 5074.44]  No, you didn't.
[5075.40 --> 5075.84]  I've answered
[5075.84 --> 5076.70]  other Twitch questions.
[5076.78 --> 5077.44]  How many other ones?
[5077.98 --> 5079.02]  I've answered Twitch
[5079.02 --> 5079.32]  statements.
[5079.32 --> 5079.58]  You know we're going to
[5079.58 --> 5079.94]  be able to go back
[5079.94 --> 5081.00]  and watch this archive
[5081.00 --> 5081.66]  and we're going to know
[5081.66 --> 5082.58]  exactly how many you
[5082.58 --> 5082.84]  answered.
[5082.84 --> 5088.38]  I started to answer
[5088.38 --> 5088.88]  Star Citizen,
[5089.04 --> 5089.56]  you cut me off.
[5089.68 --> 5090.42]  Someone's asking for
[5090.42 --> 5091.36]  a link to Razor Coms.
[5091.40 --> 5092.08]  Guys, right here.
[5093.90 --> 5094.56]  Just type it.
[5094.86 --> 5095.20]  Type it.
[5095.46 --> 5095.68]  Type it.
[5095.82 --> 5096.60]  Someone asked,
[5096.80 --> 5097.42]  okay this is what
[5097.42 --> 5098.06]  I was trying to answer
[5098.06 --> 5098.74]  when you cut me off.
[5099.02 --> 5099.64]  Someone asked if
[5099.64 --> 5100.52]  we've been keeping up
[5100.52 --> 5101.28]  with Star Citizen
[5101.28 --> 5102.18]  or our thoughts on
[5102.18 --> 5102.54]  Star Citizen.
[5102.72 --> 5102.90]  Nope.
[5103.04 --> 5104.80]  Both of us kind of
[5104.80 --> 5105.70]  waiting for Alpha.
[5105.98 --> 5106.30]  Yeah.
[5106.76 --> 5107.30]  Show me the money.
[5107.40 --> 5107.42]  We're going to wait
[5107.42 --> 5108.14]  until we can play it.
[5109.20 --> 5109.86]  And even Alpha,
[5110.00 --> 5110.20]  like.
[5111.26 --> 5112.02]  I'm going to play it.
[5112.02 --> 5112.92]  I'll play it,
[5113.00 --> 5113.48]  but I'm not going
[5113.48 --> 5114.38]  to really criticize it.
[5114.42 --> 5114.92]  I'm going to upgrade
[5114.92 --> 5115.94]  my graphics card for it.
[5116.44 --> 5116.84]  Are you?
[5117.00 --> 5117.52]  Yeah, I don't care
[5117.52 --> 5119.24]  how unoptimized it is.
[5119.58 --> 5121.18]  I'm going full bore
[5121.18 --> 5122.22]  when Star Citizen hits.
[5122.72 --> 5123.22]  What are you running?
[5123.84 --> 5124.44]  What are you going to run?
[5124.72 --> 5125.28]  I'll run,
[5125.68 --> 5126.82]  I don't know,
[5127.18 --> 5127.74]  Titan 2s.
[5128.90 --> 5129.66]  Titan 2s?
[5129.72 --> 5130.32]  I have no idea.
[5131.54 --> 5132.60]  I'll put something in there.
[5132.84 --> 5134.18]  I mean the 590's not bad,
[5134.24 --> 5135.24]  but I might need more VRAM.
[5136.10 --> 5137.02]  Because 590's only
[5137.02 --> 5138.36]  1.5 gigs per core.
[5139.38 --> 5140.28]  It's pretty low
[5140.28 --> 5141.24]  for like a
[5141.24 --> 5142.42]  CryEngine 3 game.
[5144.94 --> 5146.06]  Blueberries are so good.
[5146.82 --> 5147.62]  I think I've probably
[5147.62 --> 5148.66]  eaten like a pound of them.
[5149.04 --> 5149.96]  I've had quite a bit too,
[5150.02 --> 5150.32]  actually.
[5150.88 --> 5151.98]  Like I'm going to get sick
[5151.98 --> 5153.12]  and my poop will be blue.
[5155.34 --> 5157.26]  This is not a really good topic
[5157.26 --> 5157.68]  to talk about,
[5157.76 --> 5158.46]  but when I used to have
[5158.46 --> 5159.38]  LAN parties every year,
[5159.96 --> 5160.96]  like I used to have them
[5160.96 --> 5161.72]  every year for my birthday,
[5161.78 --> 5162.50]  I'd have a huge one.
[5162.50 --> 5162.80]  Everyone's poop was blue?
[5162.80 --> 5164.34]  And we'd have
[5164.34 --> 5165.38]  fairly consistent ones
[5165.38 --> 5166.34]  pretty much every weekend.
[5166.80 --> 5167.58]  And one of my buddies,
[5167.70 --> 5168.34]  I'd get everyone
[5168.34 --> 5169.38]  the like entry fee.
[5169.38 --> 5170.36]  Pooped once every weekend?
[5170.60 --> 5171.86]  The entry fee to one
[5171.86 --> 5172.46]  of these LAN parties
[5172.46 --> 5173.44]  was you had to bring food
[5173.44 --> 5174.52]  and your own computer.
[5175.36 --> 5176.16]  So what he would bring
[5176.16 --> 5176.98]  every time was this
[5176.98 --> 5178.56]  big bag of
[5178.56 --> 5179.40]  like basically
[5179.40 --> 5180.54]  knockoff Fruity Loops.
[5181.08 --> 5182.74]  They were really good.
[5183.10 --> 5184.34]  But after you ate them,
[5184.44 --> 5185.32]  your poop was green.
[5185.32 --> 5192.30]  So the first week
[5192.30 --> 5193.04]  he brought them,
[5193.36 --> 5194.00]  everyone was like,
[5194.14 --> 5196.10]  what's going on?
[5198.70 --> 5199.64]  Wow, that's quite
[5199.64 --> 5200.84]  the excellent troll.
[5202.70 --> 5203.78]  That was hilarious.
[5204.06 --> 5204.76]  Somebody on Twitch says,
[5204.84 --> 5205.46]  let's be honest,
[5205.46 --> 5206.24]  real Fruity Loops
[5206.24 --> 5207.20]  do that too, bro.
[5207.30 --> 5207.66]  Do they?
[5208.12 --> 5208.98]  I don't know.
[5210.38 --> 5210.98]  Someone says,
[5211.28 --> 5212.32]  stop talking about poop.
[5212.40 --> 5213.14]  I'm trying to eat.
[5215.32 --> 5216.66]  I think the most
[5216.66 --> 5217.58]  disconcerting thing
[5217.58 --> 5218.38]  is green poop.
[5219.36 --> 5220.62]  Or like that orange.
[5222.02 --> 5222.90]  Orange isn't good.
[5224.16 --> 5224.60]  Hey,
[5225.30 --> 5225.98]  my wife's here.
[5226.84 --> 5227.26]  Of course,
[5227.32 --> 5227.84]  this is the most
[5227.84 --> 5228.98]  opportune possible time
[5228.98 --> 5229.72]  for her to tune in.
[5230.10 --> 5230.48]  You want to come
[5230.48 --> 5231.10]  say hi to everyone?
[5232.62 --> 5233.46]  Sorry, what's that?
[5234.96 --> 5235.70]  She doesn't even
[5235.70 --> 5236.58]  want to say no.
[5237.18 --> 5237.84]  At any rate,
[5238.14 --> 5239.12]  with that wonderful
[5239.12 --> 5240.22]  mental image of poop,
[5240.68 --> 5242.74]  let me just see
[5242.74 --> 5243.50]  if there's anything else
[5243.50 --> 5244.20]  that's really important.
[5244.26 --> 5244.62]  Oh, yeah.
[5245.32 --> 5246.18]  You're fired
[5246.18 --> 5247.34]  by text.
[5248.12 --> 5248.46]  Oh, yeah.
[5248.48 --> 5249.32]  So this was a cool
[5249.32 --> 5250.84]  article on MSN.
[5251.82 --> 5252.22]  Jody,
[5252.40 --> 5253.10]  I unfortunately
[5253.10 --> 5254.38]  need to inform you
[5254.38 --> 5254.96]  that I have been
[5254.96 --> 5256.04]  forced to close
[5256.04 --> 5257.16]  hold on.
[5257.68 --> 5258.14]  Stop that.
[5258.80 --> 5259.40]  Bar do cheese.
[5259.54 --> 5260.40]  Effective immediately.
[5260.74 --> 5261.14]  Blah, blah, blah.
[5261.28 --> 5262.44]  So etiquette impaired
[5262.44 --> 5263.16]  restaurant owner
[5263.16 --> 5263.98]  lays off workers
[5263.98 --> 5265.22]  via text message.
[5265.58 --> 5266.46]  This is the most
[5266.46 --> 5267.16]  excellent thing
[5267.16 --> 5268.12]  that I have ever seen.
[5268.68 --> 5270.28]  And I figure
[5270.28 --> 5271.28]  this is about like
[5271.28 --> 5272.18]  picking up chicks
[5272.18 --> 5272.96]  on MSN.
[5272.96 --> 5274.32]  And this was
[5274.32 --> 5274.86]  your comment
[5274.86 --> 5275.40]  that you wrote
[5275.40 --> 5275.96]  under the thing.
[5275.96 --> 5276.74]  And I actually
[5276.74 --> 5277.64]  took offense to that
[5277.64 --> 5279.02]  because MSN
[5279.02 --> 5280.56]  was back in the day.
[5281.52 --> 5281.64]  Yeah.
[5283.56 --> 5284.04]  Wow.
[5284.50 --> 5284.96]  That is...
[5285.72 --> 5287.08]  I'm not that old.
[5287.54 --> 5288.26]  When was it big?
[5288.36 --> 5288.64]  Okay.
[5288.98 --> 5290.14]  MSN only went away
[5290.14 --> 5291.30]  like a couple months ago.
[5291.52 --> 5292.42]  I didn't say
[5292.42 --> 5293.16]  when it went away.
[5293.30 --> 5294.38]  I said when it was big.
[5294.62 --> 5294.88]  Right.
[5295.22 --> 5296.30]  MySpace is still here.
[5296.62 --> 5297.28]  It's not big.
[5297.28 --> 5298.44]  And I was like
[5298.44 --> 5299.34]  you know
[5299.34 --> 5301.50]  using MSN
[5301.50 --> 5302.30]  to pick up girls
[5302.30 --> 5303.04]  back in the day.
[5303.16 --> 5303.50]  Were you?
[5303.90 --> 5304.90]  Well not to pick them up
[5304.90 --> 5305.98]  but I certainly used
[5305.98 --> 5306.82]  well my girlfriend
[5306.82 --> 5307.42]  at the time
[5307.42 --> 5308.86]  was a long distance
[5308.86 --> 5309.58]  phone call away
[5309.58 --> 5310.48]  and back when
[5310.48 --> 5311.06]  long distance
[5311.06 --> 5312.02]  phone calls were a thing.
[5312.04 --> 5312.48]  Was she your girlfriend
[5312.48 --> 5313.78]  before you asked
[5313.78 --> 5314.42]  did you ask her
[5314.42 --> 5314.96]  out on MSN?
[5315.28 --> 5315.52]  No.
[5316.02 --> 5316.26]  There.
[5318.08 --> 5318.78]  Well at any rate.
[5318.96 --> 5319.92]  That was the only
[5319.92 --> 5320.86]  point of that comment.
[5321.78 --> 5322.68]  Also we have
[5322.68 --> 5323.50]  an EA moment
[5323.50 --> 5324.16]  for this week.
[5324.22 --> 5324.56]  I don't think
[5324.56 --> 5325.28]  we had one yet.
[5325.28 --> 5329.54]  So TP95112
[5329.54 --> 5331.88]  goes woke up
[5331.88 --> 5332.34]  this morning
[5332.34 --> 5333.04]  and was surprised
[5333.04 --> 5333.56]  by this.
[5333.74 --> 5334.14]  Enjoy.
[5334.60 --> 5335.38]  Origin survey.
[5335.76 --> 5336.54]  How likely is it
[5336.54 --> 5336.96]  that you would
[5336.96 --> 5337.68]  recommend origin
[5337.68 --> 5338.46]  to a friend?
[5339.28 --> 5339.68]  Boo.
[5343.54 --> 5344.24]  That's actually
[5344.24 --> 5345.36]  our second EA slam
[5345.36 --> 5345.84]  this week.
[5346.02 --> 5346.38]  Is it?
[5346.54 --> 5346.92]  Yeah because
[5346.92 --> 5347.88]  the Maxis devs
[5347.88 --> 5348.14]  leaving.
[5348.46 --> 5348.98]  Oh that's right.
[5348.98 --> 5349.34]  It's technically
[5349.34 --> 5350.02]  an EA slam.
[5350.72 --> 5351.08]  Yay.
[5351.52 --> 5351.84]  Boom.
[5353.68 --> 5354.20]  Alright.
[5354.56 --> 5355.26]  I think that's it.
[5355.70 --> 5356.10]  Oh no.
[5356.22 --> 5356.60]  Last thing.
[5357.02 --> 5357.60]  This is great.
[5358.28 --> 5359.58]  The thread title
[5359.58 --> 5360.68]  is Oh Dear
[5360.68 --> 5361.70]  How the Hell
[5361.70 --> 5362.94]  Did They Not Realize?
[5363.82 --> 5365.20]  And this is
[5365.20 --> 5365.84]  like
[5365.84 --> 5367.14]  just brutal.
[5367.74 --> 5368.44]  Oh wow.
[5368.46 --> 5369.10]  No way.
[5369.24 --> 5370.14]  They pulled it down.
[5370.16 --> 5370.82]  Try the second one.
[5370.86 --> 5371.50]  What's the second one?
[5373.10 --> 5375.04]  Oh no.
[5375.34 --> 5375.74]  Okay.
[5375.74 --> 5376.40]  Well.
[5376.40 --> 5376.54]  Oh.
[5377.48 --> 5378.12]  Where?
[5378.52 --> 5380.30]  So the crash.
[5382.12 --> 5383.54]  They reported.
[5383.90 --> 5385.04]  This news station
[5385.04 --> 5385.86]  reported the names
[5385.86 --> 5386.86]  of the pilots involved
[5386.86 --> 5387.38]  as
[5387.38 --> 5389.96]  Som Ting Wong
[5389.96 --> 5392.60]  Ho Li Sheet
[5392.60 --> 5393.74]  and there was one
[5393.74 --> 5394.28]  other one
[5394.28 --> 5396.26]  that was equally brutal
[5396.26 --> 5397.42]  and so the
[5397.42 --> 5399.42]  the news wench
[5399.42 --> 5400.22]  is like
[5400.22 --> 5401.34]  saying these things
[5401.34 --> 5403.00]  and not realizing
[5403.00 --> 5404.00]  in the middle of them
[5404.00 --> 5404.84]  coming out her mouth
[5404.84 --> 5405.78]  what she's saying.
[5405.96 --> 5407.56]  Captain Som Ting Wong.
[5408.34 --> 5409.44]  So apparently
[5409.44 --> 5410.30]  it was an intern
[5410.30 --> 5410.82]  or something
[5410.82 --> 5411.96]  and they were
[5411.96 --> 5412.46]  trolling
[5412.46 --> 5413.36]  and I'm sure
[5413.36 --> 5413.94]  that they're
[5413.94 --> 5414.88]  super la-fired
[5414.88 --> 5415.52]  at this point
[5415.52 --> 5417.12]  but maybe by text message
[5417.12 --> 5417.36]  even.
[5417.36 --> 5418.30]  it's like
[5418.30 --> 5419.08]  yo dog
[5419.08 --> 5420.40]  don't bother coming in.
[5421.20 --> 5421.72]  Anyway.
[5421.72 --> 5422.26]  At that point
[5422.26 --> 5423.14]  it might be justified.
[5423.38 --> 5423.92]  I think so
[5423.92 --> 5424.96]  because that's
[5424.96 --> 5425.48]  not cool.
[5425.66 --> 5425.96]  That's brutal.
[5426.40 --> 5427.30]  Okay goodnight everybody
[5427.30 --> 5428.04]  thank you so much
[5428.04 --> 5428.78]  for tuning in
[5428.78 --> 5429.82]  and I have to go
[5429.82 --> 5430.50]  help my wife
[5430.50 --> 5431.54]  clean up stuff
[5431.54 --> 5432.98]  because my day
[5432.98 --> 5433.94]  wasn't long enough already.
[5434.74 --> 5435.46]  Love you.
[5436.16 --> 5437.34]  She probably worked
[5437.34 --> 5438.04]  and stuff too.
[5438.32 --> 5438.96]  That's not a fair
