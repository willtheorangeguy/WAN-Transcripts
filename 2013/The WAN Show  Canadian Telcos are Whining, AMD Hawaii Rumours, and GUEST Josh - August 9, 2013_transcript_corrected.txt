[0.00 → 9.00] Welcome to the WAN Show! We're getting technical, and we're getting sweaty apparently because like if I gave you a bear hug right now, like it would be gross.
[9.00 → 13.00] You know it would be gross, but I'm so used to it from sports that it's like it's only a little bit gross.
[13.00 → 17.00] Right, I guess in the shower when you guys hug each other you're wet from the shower.
[19.00 → 21.00] Wow! You know I never...
[21.00 → 23.00] Like a minute in.
[23.00 → 26.00] I never, I don't think we're a minute in.
[26.00 → 32.00] I never actually played a sport that involved like group showers.
[32.00 → 33.00] Neither did I.
[33.00 → 36.00] I mean much to my regret because...
[36.00 → 38.00] Actually I guess, yeah I did.
[38.00 → 40.00] Football. You played football!
[40.00 → 42.00] Well actually football didn't out of all...
[42.00 → 43.00] No way!
[43.00 → 45.00] How plays football not involve group showers?
[45.00 → 46.00] It was hockey.
[46.00 → 49.00] Football is all about like the bum slapping and the showers and stuff is my understanding.
[49.00 → 52.00] Everybody drove home sweaty. Everybody.
[52.00 → 54.00] Like you pretty much never had locker rooms.
[54.00 → 55.00] Interesting.
[55.00 → 56.00] Because I didn't play school football.
[56.00 → 57.00] Right, okay.
[57.00 → 58.00] And we're in Canada.
[58.00 → 60.00] Right, where football is like not a thing.
[60.00 → 61.00] Not nearly as big.
[61.00 → 63.00] Alright, so things that are things.
[63.00 → 66.00] We have a great WAN show for you guys this week.
[66.00 → 69.00] John Carmack joins Oculus as CTO.
[69.00 → 72.00] But remains working for id Software.
[72.00 → 75.00] Okay, so he hasn't completely gone off his tree.
[75.00 → 76.00] Nope.
[76.00 → 85.00] But he's evidently making a major bet on VR and Oculus in particular which has got to be really exciting for them especially after the tragedy recently.
[85.00 → 86.00] Yeah.
[86.00 → 89.00] Where one of their co-founders was killed in an accident.
[89.00 → 92.00] So that's kind of a big deal.
[92.00 → 95.00] A lab grown burger cost $300,000.
[95.00 → 97.00] Tastes gross, apparently.
[97.00 → 102.00] The Jobs movie has been sort of critically...
[102.00 → 104.00] Blown up a little bit.
[104.00 → 105.00] Was who is outspoken on everything.
[105.00 → 106.00] The important Steve.
[106.00 → 107.00] Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[107.00 → 119.00] Has come out and said that a very main particular scene in the movie just didn't happen at all.
[119.00 → 123.00] And he's not too worried that it didn't happen because obviously certain things...
[123.00 → 124.00] Okay, you're telling them too much about it.
[124.00 → 125.00] This is the pre-thing.
[125.00 → 126.00] Okay, okay, okay.
[126.00 → 127.00] Hit it!
[127.00 → 128.00] Okay.
[128.00 → 130.00] Really?
[130.00 → 131.00] You've got...
[131.00 → 133.00] Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
[133.00 → 136.00] Okay, well I blame Diesel for this.
[136.00 → 139.00] Hit it!
[139.00 → 141.00] Add media file.
[141.00 → 144.00] That's not fault.
[144.00 → 145.00] Th friend point.
[145.00 → 149.00] No idea.
[149.00 → 154.00] So with us System by Joel SC, he wants some other video Dave's last name.
[154.00 → 155.00] As we did the video they enjoyed, luckily a show.
[155.00 → 156.00] Some instruments ever don't anticipate.
[156.00 → 157.00] Football!
[157.00 → 158.00] Let's put some kind of every video on Octave!
[158.00 → 159.00] Yeah, yeah!
[159.00 → 161.00] What about the rest of today?
[161.00 → 162.00] All the rest...
[163.00 → 164.00] Both Otherwise, we've got a Lunch, maybe.
[164.00 → 166.00] PBS!
[166.00 → 169.00] I do not have a TV band.
[169.00 → 170.00] Taking it!
[170.00 → 171.00] Did your hands so much?
[171.00 → 172.00] Cool!
[172.00 → 173.00] Yeah okay.
[173.00 → 174.00] So let's wait, hand over.
[174.00 → 179.58] The green machine is attached to my neck, which will obviously contribute to the sweatiness.
[179.94 → 184.50] Our special guest today, if you guys don't already know if you didn't see the YouTube announcement,
[184.96 → 187.26] is the one and only Josh from Fractal.
[187.38 → 187.68] Josh?
[187.84 → 188.56] Yes, Josh.
[188.92 → 190.32] Well, he works for a Swedish company.
[190.48 → 191.12] But he's not.
[191.48 → 192.34] But he's not Swedish.
[192.44 → 193.44] No, he's about as American.
[193.44 → 195.04] I just found out he lives in Iowa.
[195.42 → 195.56] Yeah.
[195.84 → 196.12] Yeah.
[196.26 → 196.94] You just found that out?
[196.94 → 198.00] I had no idea he lives out.
[198.28 → 200.64] I knew he was somewhere east of here.
[201.54 → 203.38] That's not really saying a lot.
[204.00 → 205.36] I knew.
[205.48 → 205.92] I knew.
[205.92 → 207.32] You live in, like, that area.
[207.62 → 208.40] It's over there.
[208.64 → 209.00] Well, no.
[209.16 → 211.92] I knew that he was on the continent of North America.
[212.18 → 214.30] I knew he was south of the 49th parallel.
[214.78 → 216.34] And I knew he was east of here.
[216.56 → 217.94] These are all the things I knew.
[218.36 → 222.78] At any rate, Josh is one of our favourite industry affiliates.
[222.78 → 230.26] He's the former CEO and president and whatever he wants to call himself of Biohazard Computers,
[230.26 → 235.72] which was a boutique system builder that actually did some really crazy stuff.
[235.88 → 239.60] I mean, when we talk about boutique system builders, we're talking paint jobs.
[239.74 → 242.26] We're talking, like, water cooling.
[242.48 → 244.68] We're talking, like, all kinds of cool stuff.
[244.68 → 244.82] Yeah.
[244.94 → 245.12] No.
[245.12 → 247.02] Josh was much crazier than that.
[247.14 → 251.06] Phase change, all that kinds of awesome, awesome, awesome stuff.
[251.56 → 252.94] So, should we jump right into it?
[252.98 → 253.80] What do you want to hit first?
[253.94 → 255.70] We have so many great topics today.
[255.84 → 260.78] We can jump right into the top of the list if you want to talk about cellular companies in Canada.
[260.80 → 262.46] Did you put things in order this week?
[262.72 → 263.18] A little bit.
[263.18 → 265.34] Because I'll be kind of impressed if you manage to do that.
[265.44 → 270.06] It has an interesting flow where it mixes it up, so if people want to see a range of stuff,
[270.24 → 271.46] give them a range of stuff.
[271.72 → 281.66] Cellular companies in Canada are crying foul about the Canadian government facilitating the entry of Verizon Wireless into Canada.
[282.82 → 285.86] Now, this is actually kind of funny.
[285.86 → 290.36] The source for this one, or at least where I first saw it, was from the NCI forum.
[290.56 → 296.56] So, I guess I better give Turban over there, who I've actually had a number of exchanges with over the years.
[296.64 → 298.56] He's got, like, 5,000 posts on there.
[299.10 → 300.42] The credit for this one.
[300.50 → 302.54] And I want you guys to watch this video.
[302.94 → 304.26] It's not that long.
[304.64 → 306.76] Canadians deserve a level playing field.
[306.90 → 307.72] Fair for Canada.
[308.16 → 314.56] This is the closest that publicly I've ever seen the main telcos here in Canada collaborate.
[314.56 → 324.48] So, Bell Rogers and TELUS are, like, this should give some idea how, like, sleeping together they all are.
[324.82 → 333.02] Because it didn't take long to get a nice, skyey-looking little website about how it's totally unfair to allow another wireless player in.
[333.18 → 334.98] And I just want you guys to watch this.
[335.04 → 336.62] I want to know if you can relate to this.
[336.96 → 340.04] Tell me if the telcos, we're going to do a Twitter blitz after this, guys.
[340.04 → 344.60] Tell me if the telcos in your country are this friggin' brutal.
[344.84 → 345.56] Hi, Michelle.
[346.38 → 347.32] Kick us off here.
[348.28 → 350.98] A giant U.S. cell phone company to come to Canada.
[351.50 → 353.76] I thought, will there be thousands of jobs lost?
[354.50 → 355.20] Think about it.
[355.56 → 358.74] Experts are saying most of their good jobs will stay south of the border.
[359.32 → 360.58] Most of their profits, too.
[360.58 → 369.40] Then this U.S. giant gets to use our existing infrastructure that took us 25 years to build, and they don't contribute a cent.
[370.06 → 373.38] So, Canadian taxpayers will be effectively subsidizing the whole thing.
[373.94 → 378.42] I believe communities like the Moncton's of Canada should get the same technology that the big cities do.
[378.42 → 384.32] That way, my neighbours can be as productive and as plugged in as people in any other part of the country.
[384.86 → 385.94] It makes me proud.
[386.46 → 387.70] It's a very Canadian thing.
[388.06 → 396.10] But now, our government is allowing a giant U.S. cell phone company to buy up small Canadian operators that cell phone companies like mine aren't allowed to buy.
[396.60 → 400.88] Since we can't bid, they'll likely even get a huge discount on the price.
[401.42 → 403.74] Effectively, at Canadian taxpayers' expense.
[403.74 → 406.46] But it gets better. Better for them.
[407.04 → 414.14] Even though this company is four times as big as all of Canada's cell phone companies combined, they're basically getting a huge discount to enter Canada.
[414.58 → 419.70] Will they care about employment in Canada? I think you know the answer. That's not fair for Canadians.
[420.18 → 425.66] Will this giant U.S. company virtually ignore small communities like mine and focus on big cities?
[426.06 → 429.36] It makes me angry that the government is selling us out.
[429.36 → 434.14] You know, we teach our kids to play fair. That's about as Canadian as it gets.
[434.58 → 439.22] So why is our government giving a giant U.S. corporation special treatment? That's not real competition.
[439.92 → 441.44] It doesn't sound fair for Canadians.
[442.26 → 444.90] Ottawa should do something about the loopholes. Fast.
[445.16 → 446.54] It doesn't just hurt me when I get a great country.
[446.54 → 447.94] No, I can't even watch this anymore.
[448.74 → 449.54] Holy crap.
[449.84 → 460.72] I don't think I made it all the way through last time either because that thing is two minutes of the most inane drivel I think I have ever seen in my life.
[461.30 → 465.18] It's this big old sob story about like mega corporations.
[465.18 → 473.80] I'm sorry. Verizon Wireless is only four times your size, and you're kind of sitting here going boo-Hoo-hoo poor me.
[475.30 → 477.44] I mean.
[480.12 → 483.60] Certain things that I like in there are just things that are completely blatantly wrong.
[483.74 → 486.94] Where they're like small communities should be able to have all the technologies that big communities have.
[486.94 → 491.46] My grandpa lives in near Winnipeg rural farmland area.
[492.14 → 495.60] Cannot get anything other than like dead slow dial up.
[495.66 → 496.44] And there goes my phone again.
[497.26 → 498.60] And like it sucks.
[498.76 → 500.12] He doesn't want it to be that slow.
[500.84 → 502.92] He's an older guy and won't use the internet that much.
[503.04 → 506.58] But when it takes him a few minutes to load a basic web page.
[506.84 → 511.64] And when I can't show him anything that we make because it's on YouTube and that's too much for dial up.
[512.18 → 514.40] It's kind of messed up.
[514.70 → 515.94] So that's just blatantly wrong.
[515.94 → 518.22] And then the whole fair play thing.
[518.34 → 519.12] Fair for Canadians.
[519.24 → 520.40] It's already not fair for Canadians.
[520.50 → 521.64] We pay way too much.
[521.78 → 523.08] It's fair for you.
[523.42 → 523.78] Jerk.
[523.94 → 525.16] It's not fair for us.
[525.54 → 530.86] I mean the thing that bothers me about this is all you need to know about someone's business model.
[530.86 → 532.38] And someone's profitability.
[533.14 → 536.16] You can know everything you need to know about a company.
[536.30 → 539.86] Without even looking at a public company's financials.
[540.28 → 545.36] If the local sports arena is called the Rogers Arena.
[545.36 → 549.60] Then Rogers had way too much money left on their balance sheet.
[549.82 → 554.50] Knows they're going to have way too much money left on their balance sheet for the foreseeable future.
[554.50 → 560.00] And needs a major spend that they can just kind of justify somehow.
[560.00 → 563.74] Because naming sports arenas is a terrible, terrible, terrible ROI.
[564.12 → 566.34] And is basically just a way to burn money.
[566.48 → 568.58] So that it kind of goes away quietly.
[568.58 → 573.70] That should be all you need to know about how much of that money could have been spent on the infrastructure.
[574.04 → 578.98] That would bring, oh, I don't know, high speed, higher speed internet connections.
[579.28 → 580.62] Better cell phone reception.
[580.90 → 582.04] More advanced technologies.
[582.42 → 583.90] Whatever else the case may be.
[583.98 → 585.26] Or improving customer service.
[585.42 → 587.72] Which quite frankly out of all of them.
[587.80 → 590.16] The ones I've had the best experience with.
[590.20 → 591.42] At least on the cell phone side.
[591.48 → 592.70] Has been Bell and Rogers.
[592.70 → 594.90] TELUS is absolutely terrible.
[595.50 → 598.04] And speaking to former TELUS employees.
[598.26 → 601.46] The amount of bureaucracy and BS that goes on there.
[601.76 → 603.12] Do you remember the story I told you?
[603.14 → 603.78] The screwdriver story.
[603.84 → 604.90] The screwdriver story.
[604.90 → 608.62] How many people does it take to put a piece of RAM in a server at TELUS?
[609.04 → 610.58] You said, I think it was four, right?
[610.76 → 612.30] It was, I believe it was three.
[612.32 → 612.82] Three, okay.
[613.04 → 615.10] Well, it was the one guy who wanted it done.
[615.70 → 616.86] Who was my buddy.
[616.92 → 617.34] Yeah, yeah.
[617.46 → 620.22] And then it was someone to open the case.
[620.38 → 620.56] Yeah.
[620.56 → 622.60] Someone to install the RAM.
[623.18 → 623.82] And then.
[624.84 → 626.92] Was it, I thought it was one person to slide it out.
[626.98 → 627.84] One person to open it.
[627.88 → 628.78] One person to put the RAM in.
[628.86 → 629.64] One person to close it.
[629.68 → 630.42] One person to close it.
[630.42 → 630.98] No, no, no.
[631.02 → 632.30] That was me joking about it.
[632.30 → 632.66] Oh, okay.
[632.66 → 634.34] No, the third guy had to supervise.
[634.56 → 635.34] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[635.34 → 635.58] Yes.
[635.66 → 636.98] So the third guy was a supervisor.
[637.08 → 638.96] And I'm sitting here going, you know what?
[639.20 → 640.26] Boo frigging who?
[640.40 → 641.50] You don't have enough money.
[641.58 → 643.30] Maybe stop wasting it on things like that.
[643.30 → 645.10] So let's go to the Twitter boards.
[645.20 → 647.66] And let you guys give us your take on the whole.
[647.66 → 656.58] How bad would you feel for your incumbent telcos if your government basically stepped in and said, well, hold on a second.
[657.00 → 659.50] Let's try to actually improve the quality of service.
[659.58 → 663.20] Whether the improvement in quality of service is for urban areas.
[663.20 → 668.66] And I do understand their point where, yeah, Verizon's going to come in, and they're going to go after the biggest whack load of customers.
[668.76 → 669.42] Of course.
[669.56 → 671.20] But you know what, you guys?
[671.46 → 677.04] What you could do is you could spend some of the money that you have from your current customers because you know what's coming.
[677.16 → 681.58] Upgrading your infrastructure and accessing the customers Verizon can't touch for now.
[681.92 → 683.38] Make it hard for them.
[684.10 → 685.86] Don't make a whiny video.
[686.54 → 687.26] Be aggressive.
[687.26 → 690.98] Give us the wireless rates that we know that you can.
[691.38 → 698.24] To clear some things up, the auction that they're talking about, the unfairness that they're talking about, is for the 700 megahertz spectrum.
[698.96 → 704.74] New entrants, so say Verizon, are able to bid for two of the four blocks of the new spectrum.
[705.08 → 706.94] They're, like, allowed to bid for two of them.
[707.40 → 711.02] And incumbents or current ones are only allowed to bid for one.
[711.64 → 715.02] Each group that's already here is only allowed to bid on one.
[715.18 → 716.58] Verizon would be allowed to bid on two.
[716.58 → 718.12] That's what they're so mad about.
[718.12 → 726.46] And they're butt hurt because they're not allowed to bid because that's anti-competitive that we're not allowed to bid.
[726.68 → 737.18] What about all the little guys that you guys drove under by overbidding for any existing spectrum that has been up for auction over the last however many decades?
[737.52 → 738.66] It's been pretty much impossible.
[738.66 → 748.78] It's been impossible for anyone else to get involved unless it's mandated by law, such as that local cable company, Delta Cable, where Shaw is not allowed in that municipality for whatever reason.
[748.88 → 750.06] I'm not quite sure what it is.
[750.06 → 758.36] But the reality of it is, these are the same things you guys are all complaint pants about that you have been doing to other companies for all of these years.
[758.36 → 762.04] So, there you go.
[762.36 → 763.52] That's what I have to say about it.
[763.52 → 764.68] All right, Twitter boards.
[765.80 → 768.16] Been on holiday for a week with no phone or internet.
[768.16 → 775.66] Hey, speaking of things that telcos need to get into the whatever century we're in about, the fact that being on holiday...
[775.66 → 777.32] Why is this all glitching out?
[777.40 → 778.04] That's kind of weird.
[778.14 → 778.58] Screen region.
[778.66 → 779.36] Let's try that again.
[779.96 → 780.92] Add screen region.
[781.58 → 782.50] Roaming charges.
[782.98 → 784.80] If that's not a you know...
[784.80 → 785.68] Archaic thing.
[785.78 → 786.10] Yeah.
[786.86 → 787.04] Oh.
[787.04 → 802.20] Like, if that's not a bunch of, like, sleeve executives sitting around a table, sort of behind closed doors, collaborating and colluding to keep rates as high as they possibly can, I don't know what is.
[803.40 → 806.90] JK, okay, you're going to have to message us again when Josh is actually on.
[806.90 → 812.78] Our government does have a fibre initiative, which all line providers have to be included in New Zealand, and it is pushing us forward.
[812.78 → 818.12] I got no problem with government-mandated everyone gets to be involved.
[818.92 → 819.12] Yeah.
[819.32 → 820.86] It's pretty much like in the UK.
[821.14 → 823.16] All the infrastructure is based on BT.
[823.34 → 826.92] They own all the lines and dictate everything, and that's exactly how it is here.
[827.08 → 841.42] The guys who own the lines just call the shots and hopefully, you know, hopefully the move to wireless spectrum where instead of it just being like, oh, well, you know, you collaborated a hundred years ago to build these phone lines,
[841.42 → 844.58] which has absolutely nothing to do with how the world works today.
[844.94 → 847.28] Therefore, you own all of it, and we can't do anything.
[847.50 → 853.68] With wireless, at least it can be controlled somewhat moving forward, and there will be a balancing act.
[853.74 → 857.48] I mean, it's not like if Verizon comes in here and steals all the business.
[857.68 → 858.62] They won't.
[858.82 → 867.68] Which they can't because they don't even own enough spectrum to do it in the first place, and it's not like the government's going to be like, yeah, you guys are never allowed to bid on spectrum ever again.
[867.90 → 871.06] It's just going to be a balancing act in the future, and they don't want it.
[871.74 → 872.92] No, they don't want that.
[872.98 → 882.94] And I just, and I guess the thing that bothers me most about it is the three of them are like getting in together to band up about it because Verizon might not come in and play their game.
[883.62 → 886.12] What I don't like is that it's not fair for Canadians.
[886.12 → 887.74] It's not fair for Canadians.
[887.88 → 890.10] And they're saying they're going to take a massive amount of the jobs.
[890.20 → 897.84] They will take some of the jobs, but I guarantee you technicians are still going to need to be up here, and if technicians still need to be up here, offices still need to be up here.
[897.90 → 898.16] Yes.
[898.32 → 899.66] There will be jobs up here.
[899.66 → 903.58] You're not going to be able to service Canada without employing any Canadians.
[903.98 → 905.98] That's actually not possible for an ISP.
[906.22 → 912.50] Anyway, so yeah, Brad seems to have the same sort of, wow, this is kind of weird.
[912.60 → 913.10] Okay, there we go.
[913.10 → 916.08] The same sort of negative feelings about Australia's telcos.
[917.02 → 919.68] Australia does have similar challenges to Canada.
[920.06 → 927.18] Large landmass, small sort of dense population centres, but it still could be better.
[927.42 → 928.90] I would be very happy.
[929.06 → 930.46] There's no good data plans here.
[930.56 → 931.72] Top speeds are one megabit.
[931.72 → 934.10] Bring on the competition.
[934.10 → 934.12] Bring on the competition.
[934.26 → 936.38] The Canadian telcos need to man up.
[936.82 → 937.22] Indeed.
[938.08 → 939.16] August 9th.
[939.24 → 939.76] Way to go.
[940.10 → 941.06] You did it again.
[941.82 → 942.70] And I'm in the Maria...
[942.70 → 944.74] I say boohoo, and I'm in the Maritimes.
[944.88 → 945.20] Indeed.
[946.72 → 947.92] You're brutal, dude.
[948.04 → 949.72] Okay, I know this is safe to click on.
[950.10 → 952.94] You guys may actually, like, love this.
[953.00 → 953.34] Here, hold on.
[953.38 → 954.52] I'm going to see if I can find one.
[954.58 → 955.00] There you go.
[955.36 → 958.74] So one of our viewers has acquired a Pikachu onesie.
[959.38 → 963.40] So go ahead and burn him on that as much as you want.
[963.54 → 964.24] That's awesome.
[964.26 → 965.22] But I think it's awesome.
[966.36 → 972.12] Do you think newer FX 8350s will be worse overclockers now that the best chips are being badged as 9590s?
[972.12 → 973.74] That is actually a very good question.
[973.88 → 975.38] We should probably talk about that later.
[975.44 → 977.56] Do you want to throw that on the dock while I continue the splits?
[977.56 → 979.56] Sound card for HD558.
[980.46 → 983.40] Anything from Asus' Sonar line would be a great option.
[983.48 → 987.98] You don't necessarily need one with a beefy amp because that is not a high-impedance pair of headphones.
[989.00 → 994.22] Perhaps they should pull their fingers out of their collective butts, I think is the word you were looking for,
[994.46 → 996.78] instead of complaining like spoiled kids.
[997.60 → 998.70] Yes, indeed.
[999.14 → 1001.04] What are my opinions on the new LG G2?
[1001.32 → 1001.72] I don't know.
[1001.80 → 1004.84] I asked for an evil unit to check out, and sort of nothing ever happened,
[1004.96 → 1006.24] so I don't really have much of an opinion.
[1006.24 → 1010.56] I'm looking for a beast card to hang any game.
[1010.66 → 1011.10] 780?
[1011.58 → 1013.10] Hard to go wrong with 780.
[1013.50 → 1019.30] However, one of our topics later on is the rumour that AMD's Hawaii series GPUs may be coming soon.
[1019.98 → 1021.44] So stay tuned for that.
[1022.14 → 1025.48] Was that an Aperture Science water bottle I saw you drinking from?
[1025.58 → 1026.92] Yes, indeed it was.
[1027.40 → 1032.56] Hydrogen monoxide containment unit, I think is the terminology we're looking for, not water bottle.
[1032.56 → 1035.00] So, there you go.
[1036.58 → 1038.02] Let's see if we've got anything more.
[1038.14 → 1039.88] A little bit more on the Twitter blitz.
[1040.02 → 1042.84] 4K content needs at least 20 megabits per second down.
[1043.20 → 1044.52] I'm all for more competition.
[1044.66 → 1046.62] Help us get closer to the awesome I want.
[1046.76 → 1047.16] Indeed.
[1047.94 → 1054.64] Someone says, refresh XSplit, and what is that blue slash green light on the vengeance box behind Slick?
[1054.64 → 1056.60] I got no idea.
[1058.66 → 1059.34] Yeah, I don't know.
[1059.88 → 1060.24] Alright.
[1061.78 → 1063.30] 4570S versus 8350.
[1063.42 → 1065.40] Those are very different chips.
[1066.36 → 1071.26] The 4570S is superpower efficient, and the FX8350 is anything but...
[1071.26 → 1071.82] Super not.
[1071.96 → 1072.18] Yeah.
[1072.54 → 1074.88] Like, super, like, power...
[1074.88 → 1076.78] Like, just...
[1076.78 → 1077.80] superpower man.
[1078.02 → 1081.34] Like, pedal to the metal and efficiency to the winds.
[1081.34 → 1084.64] So, I guess decide what you want, and then buy that.
[1085.68 → 1087.20] What do you think of deleting the chips?
[1087.30 → 1088.58] I think it's kind of risky.
[1089.58 → 1090.30] Cool, though.
[1090.42 → 1092.20] Seriously, America has this stuff, too.
[1092.44 → 1094.00] Comcast pretty much has its own region.
[1094.38 → 1098.58] While Verizon doesn't come into my region, it's that whole territorial monopoly thing.
[1098.62 → 1098.98] So, you know what?
[1098.98 → 1108.92] I would love to see guys from the States coming up to Canada and sort of pooping all over the collusion that's going on here.
[1109.18 → 1113.56] And I'd love to see guys from Canada go down to the States and poop all over the collusion there.
[1113.70 → 1117.98] Would absolutely love to see it because it's needed.
[1118.08 → 1122.26] And I think eventually they're all going to just collude with all of each other.
[1122.26 → 1128.34] But at least initially, we might see some improvements, which will maybe get us a little bit caught up in terms of...
[1128.34 → 1130.78] Them fighting for any amount of time will probably help.
[1131.04 → 1131.36] Yes.
[1131.48 → 1131.92] At least a little bit.
[1132.24 → 1135.78] You'll at least be able to sign up for, like, some kind of ridiculous deal.
[1136.04 → 1138.56] That you can try and hold on to and grandfather in forever.
[1139.20 → 1139.62] Yes.
[1140.28 → 1141.68] That is the secret.
[1142.04 → 1147.02] I mean, honestly, okay, I'm putting on my old NCI X hat for a bit.
[1147.02 → 1152.04] When New egg launched in Canada, like, we were pooping bricks.
[1152.62 → 1166.64] Like, leading up to that launch, every day was another conversation about sort of, you know, what are they going to do to address sort of the differences in the Canadian market?
[1166.74 → 1168.06] Because we knew things they didn't.
[1168.56 → 1171.02] In fact, NCI X still knows a lot of things.
[1171.02 → 1177.46] I can look at New egg's offering and I can go, yeah, they clearly haven't figured this out yet, about the way business works in Canada.
[1178.12 → 1181.44] And anyway, we were pooping bricks and that was scary.
[1182.02 → 1190.10] And when New egg launched in Canada, NCI X countered with one of the most aggressive sales in its history as a company.
[1190.10 → 1195.72] And customers don't always understand how much it costs to put on a sale because it wasn't Black Friday.
[1195.96 → 1196.88] It wasn't Boxing Day.
[1197.00 → 1201.84] There weren't manufacturer rebates that we were able to leverage.
[1202.12 → 1205.24] It was just, okay, well, here's all of our money.
[1205.66 → 1207.30] Just, here you go, customers.
[1207.58 → 1209.06] I guess we don't need this anymore.
[1210.06 → 1214.24] And then New egg's grand opening sale was pathetic.
[1214.48 → 1216.74] It was like some outdated phenom was like the highlight.
[1216.74 → 1217.66] I remember yours.
[1217.66 → 1218.38] The highlight.
[1218.78 → 1220.16] I took some of that NCI X money.
[1220.22 → 1220.88] Yeah, I bet you.
[1220.88 → 1221.08] I'm sorry.
[1221.40 → 1222.72] That was a crazy sale.
[1222.74 → 1223.20] I took a lot.
[1223.28 → 1226.84] I think I built two computers for other people out of that sale and took some stuff for myself.
[1226.96 → 1227.52] Yeah, it was.
[1227.52 → 1227.92] I'm not even kidding.
[1228.02 → 1229.92] Oh, it was like bat crap crazy.
[1230.52 → 1232.72] So I don't remember where I was going with that.
[1232.90 → 1234.56] But, yeah.
[1235.88 → 1237.92] Why don't we move on to our next topic, shall we?
[1238.08 → 1239.72] What do you think we should do next?
[1240.76 → 1242.16] Maybe a tech topic?
[1242.16 → 1242.72] We bounced around for a little while.
[1242.92 → 1243.18] Sure.
[1243.18 → 1245.92] I like that screen one.
[1246.30 → 1249.80] If you want to talk to, because we should be getting Josh on here soon.
[1249.88 → 1251.28] Yeah, let's get Josh going soon.
[1251.60 → 1252.68] Where is the screen one?
[1252.78 → 1254.20] Amazon working on paper white.
[1254.50 → 1254.96] Oh, okay.
[1255.02 → 1255.72] That's your topic.
[1255.86 → 1258.58] So you better cover that one.
[1258.70 → 1259.00] All right.
[1259.34 → 1261.66] So Amazon's working on a new screen technology.
[1261.82 → 1265.00] This is an article from Quartz.com, QZ.com.
[1265.56 → 1266.38] Go ahead.
[1266.38 → 1270.72] So basically they're going to be putting LEDs horizontally along the panel.
[1271.30 → 1275.42] And then it'll bounce light along the whole, what do they call it?
[1275.50 → 1277.42] A NATO imprinted light guide.
[1277.52 → 1278.60] It'll bounce it all the way across.
[1279.00 → 1283.18] And that will make the light hit the screen and then reflect out towards you.
[1283.46 → 1287.22] Instead of the light shining directly at you, it'll be a reflection,
[1287.42 → 1290.32] which is more realistic when looking at paper books.
[1290.32 → 1294.66] And it's supposed to be a huge improvement and make it a lot better experience for the user,
[1295.00 → 1297.44] much less eye strain when you're reading for a long period of time.
[1297.92 → 1300.98] And just, yeah, it's very interesting technology.
[1301.12 → 1301.92] No one else has done it.
[1302.36 → 1307.82] And they're not going to compromise on things like colour depth and resolution or anything like that.
[1308.24 → 1309.30] So this is quite interesting.
[1309.30 → 1312.72] So we're still using a traditional LCD panel.
[1312.88 → 1316.72] Actually, this is something that a lot of people get confused about.
[1316.96 → 1319.08] Should I buy an LCD or an LED?
[1319.08 → 1321.14] They're the same thing.
[1321.24 → 1322.40] It's the backlighting that changes.
[1322.72 → 1328.32] A liquid crystal display is available on a wide variety of different forms.
[1328.46 → 1330.70] And it's the most common flat panel display type.
[1331.08 → 1334.58] Anything from your old calculator uses an LCD.
[1334.70 → 1335.48] It's monochrome.
[1335.62 → 1336.70] It has no backlight.
[1337.08 → 1337.50] Backlight.
[1337.60 → 1338.72] We're about to talk about that in a moment.
[1339.18 → 1345.32] Anything up to even the LCDs you might find in a rear projection TV a while ago,
[1345.32 → 1348.40] back when the larger LCD panels were too expensive to manufacture,
[1348.40 → 1349.70] so they would make small ones,
[1349.78 → 1354.08] and then blow a massive backlight through them to project onto a screen,
[1354.26 → 1358.26] or something like an LCD panel that you might find at your typical computer,
[1358.46 → 1362.48] which would typically have cold cathode lights behind it, fluorescent lighting,
[1362.64 → 1363.96] and now has moved to LEAD.
[1363.96 → 1370.82] So the LCD panel itself is an image that doesn't inherently emit any light.
[1370.92 → 1373.54] That's where OLED is different because it emits its own light.
[1373.82 → 1376.88] You have to put some kind of light source behind it.
[1377.12 → 1380.92] So in this way, they're not actually putting it necessarily.
[1382.06 → 1384.68] They can use that same LCD panel tech.
[1384.68 → 1388.88] To reflect light instead of shine light out from behind it.
[1389.28 → 1392.06] So it's supposed to make it a much better experience.
[1392.68 → 1393.58] It's called Light Guide.
[1394.10 → 1396.00] Well, the technology is called Light Guide.
[1396.10 → 1397.38] Their screen is going to be called Paper white.
[1397.80 → 1403.52] And Amazon has recently acquired a company that's working on tablets.
[1403.52 → 1406.94] So people are thinking that instead of just making e-readers,
[1407.34 → 1410.14] Amazon is going to take this tech and make a tablet.
[1410.72 → 1415.92] And there's a lot behind this, and it's in this Quartz web page,
[1416.00 → 1418.86] which will be on the dock, which we will upload with the live stream later on.
[1419.76 → 1420.20] Fascinating.
[1420.48 → 1423.48] So Amazon is realizing that e-readers have gone down,
[1423.54 → 1426.00] I think it's like 12% in the past little while.
[1426.00 → 1427.20] Well, it's so dead.
[1427.46 → 1428.00] Oh, yeah, yeah.
[1428.00 → 1428.50] Come on.
[1428.50 → 1432.26] So Amazon is trying to respond to that by making a tablet,
[1432.36 → 1435.72] which has gone up, I think it's like 78% in the last year or something like that.
[1435.78 → 1436.70] Oh, yeah, it's ludicrous.
[1436.84 → 1437.42] I was looking at them.
[1437.52 → 1440.44] Did Diesel send you the same article that was looking at, I think,
[1440.50 → 1442.16] smartphone shipments and tablet shipments?
[1442.28 → 1443.12] Oh, it's ridiculous.
[1443.34 → 1443.44] Yeah.
[1443.90 → 1445.98] It's like you're kind of looking at the numbers going,
[1446.26 → 1449.66] how many hundreds of millions of them?
[1449.72 → 1451.56] Does everyone not have one yet at this point then?
[1452.36 → 1453.46] But there you go.
[1453.96 → 1454.76] Evidently not.
[1455.12 → 1457.56] This actually ties into one of our other news articles,
[1457.56 → 1460.58] which is maybe the last one we'll do before we get Josh to join us.
[1461.36 → 1466.84] And that is the rumour that Amazon is working on a game console.
[1466.98 → 1468.48] So an Android-based game console.
[1468.62 → 1469.62] This isn't in the doc.
[1469.68 → 1470.68] I don't know if you know about this.
[1470.86 → 1471.78] Not in the doc at all.
[1471.92 → 1472.42] Yeah, I know.
[1472.50 → 1472.66] Whatever.
[1473.44 → 1475.00] So it's going to be,
[1475.10 → 1477.36] so it would go head-to-head with something like the OUA,
[1477.88 → 1482.18] which I think everyone's kind of in agreement on was kind of a failure.
[1483.78 → 1486.76] Like things have changed since it got released, and they've made improvements,
[1486.76 → 1487.76] but it's still...
[1487.76 → 1493.58] And this is the danger of kick-starting something based on specs that are current
[1493.58 → 1496.54] and then how long it takes to really bring a product to market.
[1496.68 → 1498.32] I mean, something like NVIDIA Shield,
[1498.82 → 1501.06] if NVIDIA were to wait,
[1501.16 → 1503.28] like if they had two business units internally,
[1503.88 → 1505.32] Terra and Shield,
[1505.60 → 1508.48] and Shield wasn't allowed to touch Terra technology
[1508.48 → 1510.92] until it was released publicly,
[1510.92 → 1513.96] Shield would be months away.
[1514.06 → 1514.18] Yeah.
[1514.40 → 1518.60] Because it takes so long to bring an actual finished product to market.
[1519.00 → 1521.70] That's why someone like OUA never stood a chance
[1521.70 → 1524.84] because they're going to be working with off-the-shelf components
[1524.84 → 1528.28] rather than working with what's coming next.
[1528.82 → 1531.46] So OUA is sort of a bad example
[1531.46 → 1533.42] because I think it just never really stood a chance.
[1533.52 → 1533.64] Yeah.
[1533.64 → 1535.72] But with someone with the clout of Amazon
[1535.72 → 1539.02] banking on this whole Android console thing,
[1539.16 → 1541.52] with someone with the clout of NVIDIA
[1541.52 → 1545.58] banking on this whole Android console concept thing with Shield,
[1545.90 → 1547.64] which by the way, our Shield is coming.
[1548.38 → 1549.02] Coming on the way.
[1549.06 → 1550.28] I haven't seen tracking yet,
[1550.38 → 1551.66] but it's like confirmed.
[1551.66 → 1552.12] It's at least on the way.
[1552.36 → 1552.56] Yep.
[1552.84 → 1553.80] This is interesting
[1553.80 → 1556.32] because more game developers are going to come back on this
[1556.32 → 1557.42] because there's Shield.
[1557.62 → 1559.48] People are going to want to be making games for Android
[1559.48 → 1560.18] because of Shield.
[1560.18 → 1563.62] And then when Amazon steps behind something like this,
[1563.70 → 1566.06] people are going to want to be making Android games
[1566.06 → 1567.36] because of Amazon's console.
[1567.76 → 1569.58] So one of the problems with OUA
[1569.58 → 1572.14] is everyone went emulators and then kind of stopped.
[1573.10 → 1574.64] Because everyone just wanted emulators.
[1575.02 → 1576.92] Now people are going to be actually interested
[1576.92 → 1579.00] in developing games for this platform,
[1579.12 → 1579.92] which is really important.
[1579.94 → 1580.70] And of course,
[1580.84 → 1583.84] for those of you who are going to sort of attack him immediately for this,
[1583.90 → 1586.54] of course developers were already interested in Android games.
[1586.86 → 1589.08] But they were interested in touchscreen Android games
[1589.08 → 1590.80] that were meant to be played on a tablet and a phone.
[1591.30 → 1593.86] Now Android is moving forward
[1593.86 → 1596.24] to what someone like NVIDIA
[1596.24 → 1598.16] has been trying to get towards
[1598.16 → 1600.30] since the first Terra.
[1600.54 → 1600.66] Yeah.
[1600.80 → 1604.24] Which does we want console graphics on this thing
[1604.24 → 1606.14] because we ultimately...
[1606.14 → 1609.22] And like this is the scariest part of it
[1609.22 → 1611.56] is like how upset is NVIDIA
[1611.56 → 1614.20] that AMD has every design win in the next-gen console?
[1614.82 → 1615.78] Maybe not at all.
[1615.92 → 1616.88] Because they're going for...
[1616.88 → 1619.90] Because the next-gen console is going to be a 10-year device.
[1620.24 → 1623.50] You look at how quickly NVIDIA is ramping up the power...
[1623.50 → 1624.44] Or not just NVIDIA.
[1624.56 → 1626.20] I mean, I'm harping on NVIDIA
[1626.20 → 1627.94] because they're kind of in the thick of all this.
[1628.24 → 1630.64] But you look at how quickly the GPU power
[1630.64 → 1632.84] on these mobile devices is ramping up.
[1633.04 → 1635.12] We could be looking at another few years
[1635.12 → 1637.54] because we've already pretty much caught up with Terra 4.
[1637.62 → 1639.24] We've caught up to current-gen console.
[1640.04 → 1641.16] A few more years,
[1641.30 → 1642.72] especially with yearly iterations,
[1642.72 → 1644.84] we could have caught up to the next-gen consoles.
[1645.30 → 1648.80] And with a device that doesn't have to have a Kine ct plugged into it.
[1648.90 → 1649.06] No.
[1649.10 → 1650.86] And doesn't have to hook up to your TV.
[1651.16 → 1653.12] And doesn't have to do whatever you don't care about.
[1653.28 → 1655.28] And maybe doesn't have the same DRM restrictions
[1655.28 → 1657.38] that you can root, and you can really get into.
[1657.60 → 1659.46] And you'll probably be able to record more easily
[1659.46 → 1660.78] and all this other kind of stuff.
[1660.84 → 1661.86] Is the console dead?
[1662.92 → 1664.48] That's actually a fascinating statement.
[1664.74 → 1666.72] And possible, but we won't know for years.
[1666.82 → 1668.26] But we won't know for a few years.
[1668.26 → 1672.64] Maybe guys like Microsoft are too hard to take down?
[1673.40 → 1674.14] I don't know.
[1675.90 → 1677.18] Microsoft's pretty big.
[1677.42 → 1680.54] They're pretty big, but they're falling pretty hard pretty fast.
[1680.62 → 1682.68] Maybe that's why Microsoft is banking on things
[1682.68 → 1683.94] that aren't necessarily gaming.
[1684.54 → 1685.58] Man, maybe that's it.
[1685.84 → 1688.00] Football, all those other kinds of TV.
[1688.22 → 1690.66] Convince me Android can't handle things that aren't gaming.
[1691.06 → 1692.06] Asus Cube, anyone?
[1692.96 → 1694.40] I'm not playing this battle.
[1695.02 → 1697.10] You know, Google Chromecast, anyone?
[1697.10 → 1700.64] Like, Gen 5 of that thing?
[1701.08 → 1701.86] That's incredible.
[1702.24 → 1703.14] It's already incredible.
[1703.24 → 1704.78] With a Terra 8 in it?
[1705.00 → 1706.28] I don't know.
[1706.48 → 1708.48] Anyway, good luck PS4.
[1708.58 → 1709.54] Good luck Xbox One.
[1709.60 → 1710.38] It was nice knowing you.
[1711.34 → 1714.02] Why don't we go ahead and fire up comes here
[1714.02 → 1719.40] and see if Josh Fractal has managed to get his headset figured out.
[1719.42 → 1720.84] Did you manage to do a test call with him?
[1721.02 → 1721.04] No.
[1721.04 → 1721.50] Oh, boy.
[1721.84 → 1723.68] I was zoned out working on the dock
[1723.68 → 1724.88] when he first got it installed.
[1724.88 → 1727.92] And then I went to invite him, and he had left at that point.
[1727.98 → 1728.58] That was my bad.
[1728.74 → 1729.08] All right.
[1729.14 → 1729.46] You know what?
[1729.48 → 1731.18] We should just, like, take a...
[1731.18 → 1731.76] Oh, yeah.
[1731.84 → 1732.96] Josh Fractal's online.
[1733.08 → 1733.38] All right.
[1733.46 → 1734.02] Well, here.
[1734.08 → 1735.96] Why don't I let you kind of talk about that
[1735.96 → 1737.52] while I do a Twitter blitz here.
[1737.64 → 1737.90] Sure.
[1738.12 → 1740.14] And, of course, they're on the same computer.
[1741.02 → 1741.64] So that...
[1741.64 → 1741.90] Hey.
[1741.90 → 1743.54] Oh, wow.
[1743.54 → 1743.66] Wow.
[1743.96 → 1744.26] Wow.
[1744.58 → 1746.44] Shots fired already.
[1746.86 → 1749.38] This guy is hard to...
[1749.38 → 1752.58] It's kind of hard to deal with having him on our livestream here.
[1753.10 → 1756.78] Let's see if I can get this to actually work.
[1757.04 → 1758.80] I'm not that impressed with XSplit today.
[1758.90 → 1761.98] I don't know what's going on here.
[1761.98 → 1766.48] But this is some serious business nonsense
[1766.48 → 1769.04] that is making my life difficult here.
[1769.22 → 1772.26] So we're going to go ahead and recapture that screen region
[1772.26 → 1774.18] that I've already captured a couple of times.
[1774.38 → 1774.98] And apparently...
[1775.98 → 1777.04] Oh, that's weird.
[1777.18 → 1780.98] Racer comes does not get picked up by XSplit,
[1781.68 → 1784.14] which actually makes sense
[1784.14 → 1786.94] because a game streamer
[1786.94 → 1788.96] who's using comes for voice communication
[1788.96 → 1791.04] wouldn't want their bloody XSplit...
[1791.04 → 1793.34] or their comm stuff all over the place.
[1794.00 → 1794.32] All right.
[1794.36 → 1795.08] Well, at any rate,
[1795.52 → 1800.54] let's go ahead and fire this baby up.
[1803.22 → 1803.98] All right, Josh.
[1804.02 → 1805.36] So just click the headset button
[1805.36 → 1806.46] in the top left-hand corner.
[1806.92 → 1807.40] There you go.
[1807.82 → 1809.02] Yo, Josh.
[1809.04 → 1810.12] How goes, bro?
[1810.60 → 1811.42] Oh, it's going.
[1811.58 → 1812.08] How are you doing?
[1812.76 → 1813.60] Pretty good.
[1813.60 → 1816.44] I noticed that you jacked up my style
[1816.44 → 1818.56] with your guest picture here.
[1823.52 → 1825.64] And Josh is listening to the stream,
[1825.82 → 1827.30] not to Racer comes,
[1827.30 → 1829.40] so he needs to go ahead and turn off his stream
[1829.40 → 1830.50] so he can talk to us.
[1830.56 → 1831.32] Already did, man.
[1834.72 → 1836.44] So you think I jacked your style?
[1837.16 → 1838.90] You hardcore jacked my style.
[1839.00 → 1841.56] I was the first one to do a picture like this, obviously.
[1841.56 → 1843.24] Yeah, except for Steve Jobs.
[1843.24 → 1845.10] Yeah, except for that guy.
[1845.22 → 1848.20] But, I mean, what did he ever do that was...
[1848.20 → 1850.18] He probably wasn't the first one to do it anyway.
[1851.30 → 1852.46] Well, yeah, you never know.
[1852.52 → 1854.12] But, I mean, he made it popular and sexy.
[1854.36 → 1855.78] I mean, and he probably trademarked it.
[1855.90 → 1857.36] So we're both going to get sued.
[1857.70 → 1860.12] Yeah, I actually did worry about that.
[1860.30 → 1861.92] Like, I wondered if it was okay
[1861.92 → 1863.50] for me to take a picture of myself
[1863.50 → 1865.36] being all, like, glasses and...
[1865.36 → 1867.26] Maybe, like, the particular finger orientation
[1867.26 → 1869.58] made it a curved design that they could patent.
[1870.58 → 1872.92] Yeah, I think you're pinch-zooming your chin in that one.
[1872.94 → 1873.80] I'm not quite sure, though.
[1875.14 → 1876.36] So how are you?
[1876.72 → 1878.36] How's Fractal?
[1878.50 → 1879.26] How's business?
[1879.50 → 1880.72] How's the PC industry?
[1881.22 → 1882.64] And how is it...
[1882.64 → 1884.38] Do you cry yourself to sleep at night
[1884.38 → 1886.84] because you don't still run your own company?
[1887.14 → 1888.16] Biohazard, I think it was called.
[1889.00 → 1889.62] Oh, man.
[1889.66 → 1890.90] We're starting quick, aren't we?
[1891.54 → 1893.48] First, I guess I'd like to be the cool one
[1893.48 → 1895.42] and say happy birthday to Fatal Flex.
[1895.70 → 1897.24] They've been posting over there in the comments.
[1897.38 → 1899.22] So can you guys give them a shout-out for me real quick?
[1899.58 → 1900.04] Shout-out!
[1900.06 → 1900.54] Happy birthday!
[1901.12 → 1901.84] See, there we go.
[1902.68 → 1904.40] No, work has been good.
[1904.46 → 1905.24] Work has been busy.
[1906.04 → 1907.86] You know, obviously got back from Computer
[1907.86 → 1910.20] where we partied it out for a little while.
[1910.20 → 1911.96] I mean, worked very hard.
[1912.64 → 1914.20] And then, you know, we got...
[1914.94 → 1915.76] Oh, man.
[1915.84 → 1916.20] It's just...
[1917.02 → 1918.16] If it's not one thing, it's another.
[1918.26 → 1918.88] But it's going good.
[1918.98 → 1919.34] It's good.
[1919.44 → 1919.80] It's good.
[1920.16 → 1923.18] Yeah, you guys have done some LAN presents recently.
[1923.46 → 1925.38] Oh, so for those of you who don't know,
[1925.74 → 1927.94] this is Josh from Fractal Design,
[1928.10 → 1929.90] formerly of Biohazard Computers.
[1930.34 → 1933.28] He is an enthusiast at heart.
[1933.42 → 1935.96] This guy has done more hardcore stuff with PCs
[1935.96 → 1937.72] than I have done.
[1937.84 → 1938.94] That is for certain.
[1938.94 → 1941.04] And he works as the...
[1941.04 → 1941.70] What's your title?
[1941.90 → 1945.14] Like, lapdog to the president of Fractal
[1945.14 → 1946.46] or something like that, North America?
[1946.92 → 1949.38] Well, it was going to be just taller than Linus,
[1949.44 → 1951.32] but that didn't really narrow it down at all.
[1951.54 → 1953.00] I mean, that's a pretty broad category.
[1953.28 → 1956.06] So, yeah, VP of Marketing for North America.
[1957.24 → 1958.74] That would be my official title.
[1959.58 → 1960.24] All right.
[1960.32 → 1962.74] So, do you want to talk Fractal stuff first
[1962.74 → 1965.28] or do you want to just kind of jump into some of the...
[1965.28 → 1968.60] I know there was that one topic that you were champing at the bit
[1968.60 → 1969.70] to talk to us about.
[1969.80 → 1970.94] Do you want to get right into that?
[1971.34 → 1972.04] Yeah, it just depends.
[1972.10 → 1973.14] Do you have a seven-second delay?
[1974.30 → 1975.06] You might want that.
[1976.86 → 1977.50] Wait, what?
[1977.94 → 1980.42] It's seven-second delay so that you can bleep out swear words.
[1980.70 → 1981.06] Oh.
[1981.52 → 1982.52] Come on, Linus.
[1982.84 → 1983.16] Oh, man.
[1983.16 → 1985.96] No, let's just do this thing.
[1986.38 → 1986.76] All right.
[1986.92 → 1988.14] So, this...
[1988.14 → 1991.22] I sent this to Josh and I got back an email.
[1991.48 → 1992.62] Like, what is that?
[1992.70 → 1994.14] Like, four in the morning, your time?
[1994.32 → 1995.56] Yeah, it was about four in the morning.
[1996.00 → 1996.22] Yeah.
[1996.68 → 1997.54] Which was...
[1997.54 → 1997.70] Yeah.
[1997.74 → 1998.84] Oh, that's perfect.
[1999.04 → 1999.26] Sorry.
[1999.36 → 1999.86] I'm excited.
[1999.86 → 2001.04] I'm so excited.
[2001.30 → 2003.06] Slick wasn't CC'd on the email.
[2003.24 → 2003.90] So, here we go.
[2004.26 → 2006.16] There's an Indiegogo on...
[2007.06 → 2009.38] That must be the stupidest thing
[2009.38 → 2011.04] that I've ever seen on the internet.
[2011.04 → 2013.24] This video thumbnail right here
[2013.24 → 2015.22] should probably tell you pretty much
[2015.22 → 2016.48] everything you need to know
[2016.48 → 2017.80] about this Indiegogo,
[2018.14 → 2019.72] which is basically, like,
[2020.02 → 2022.04] two nerds and guys,
[2022.62 → 2022.96] you know,
[2023.30 → 2024.46] no disrespect or anything,
[2024.68 → 2025.68] but you're two nerds
[2025.68 → 2027.24] sitting on chairs
[2027.24 → 2028.48] in the middle of a yard,
[2028.80 → 2030.40] and I'm just going to
[2030.40 → 2032.74] skim through a little bit of this Indiegogo,
[2032.96 → 2035.66] and then we are just going to blast this thing.
[2035.98 → 2037.76] Between me, Josh, and Slick,
[2037.82 → 2040.14] I don't think they're going to have any anus left.
[2041.04 → 2043.70] Careful wording, man.
[2043.70 → 2047.58] Let me see if I have this written down right.
[2048.54 → 2050.18] You guys have a 3.8 gigahertz
[2050.18 → 2052.70] overclocked 6-core i7 processor,
[2053.08 → 2054.98] 6 gigabyte video card,
[2055.30 → 2056.78] 32 gigabytes of RAM,
[2057.56 → 2059.26] all booting from a solid-state drive.
[2059.78 → 2061.16] I mean, this would normally retail
[2061.16 → 2062.32] from about $3,000 to $4,000
[2062.32 → 2063.88] if you could even find it.
[2064.78 → 2065.92] If you could find it.
[2066.04 → 2066.48] Oh, man.
[2066.64 → 2068.12] I'm starting early here.
[2068.44 → 2070.08] Originally, we were going to go cheaper than that.
[2070.46 → 2070.84] Cheaper.
[2070.84 → 2071.68] None of the big manufacturers
[2071.68 → 2072.42] are hard to deal with.
[2073.46 → 2075.26] I'm fighting back the rage right now.
[2075.50 → 2076.38] The machine we wanted to build.
[2077.22 → 2079.12] So, don't you think this could lead
[2079.12 → 2080.38] to awkward conversations
[2080.38 → 2081.50] with big industry producers?
[2081.72 → 2082.54] I mean, you're undercutting
[2082.54 → 2083.60] their prices quite a bit.
[2084.14 → 2085.14] Awkward conversations,
[2085.78 → 2087.88] like how overpriced their computers are?
[2088.10 → 2089.66] We're okay with that conversation.
[2090.44 → 2090.84] Right.
[2091.08 → 2092.20] Well, then I'm just trying to make sure
[2092.20 → 2093.74] you guys aren't getting in over your head.
[2094.22 → 2096.14] I mean, there are a lot of big dogs out there.
[2096.14 → 2097.46] I think we've made our purpose clear.
[2097.46 → 2110.68] is it easy to fight game
[2110.68 → 2111.46] goals?
[2111.46 → 2113.32] outcome. On one hand, we make
[2113.32 → 2115.48] super awesome computers specifically for gamers.
[2116.00 → 2117.40] On the other hand, we force
[2117.40 → 2119.06] the big companies to bring their prices down.
[2119.64 → 2121.28] Anyway, so basically the summary,
[2121.46 → 2123.30] guys, is that these guys have
[2123.30 → 2125.34] an Indiegogo. Actually, here, I'm going to go back to the
[2125.34 → 2127.50] Indiegogo. So they've actually got
[2127.50 → 2128.90] 4,000 contributors.
[2129.56 → 2131.20] They're basically saying that
[2131.20 → 2132.82] for... No, no, no, they have $4,000.
[2133.18 → 2134.90] $4,000 worth of contributions.
[2134.90 → 2136.28] They have 12 contributors.
[2136.34 → 2139.02] So there's a comparison matrix down here that has
[2139.02 → 2140.94] Alienware and what they charge for a
[2140.94 → 2143.16] system and build it yourself and what it costs.
[2143.64 → 2144.88] And they're Innovation Gaming,
[2144.98 → 2146.92] which has a 3970X, 32
[2146.92 → 2148.78] gigs of RAM, a 7990,
[2149.22 → 2150.72] a 512 gig SSD,
[2151.04 → 2152.56] and a final price of $1,000.
[2154.18 → 2155.10] I don't
[2155.10 → 2156.92] know if they're
[2156.92 → 2158.86] deluded or if they're
[2158.86 → 2160.66] just scammers.
[2160.80 → 2162.94] One thing I've wondered is I'm giving them
[2162.94 → 2165.06] as much insane degree of benefit
[2165.06 → 2166.46] of the doubt that I can possibly imagine
[2166.46 → 2168.84] is that they have found someone online
[2168.84 → 2170.74] that is claiming to be
[2170.74 → 2172.96] a distributor of these things and is claiming
[2172.96 → 2175.22] if you buy enough and pay us up front,
[2175.38 → 2176.72] we will give you all of this
[2176.72 → 2177.40] for this price.
[2177.52 → 2179.02] So they decided to make an Indiegogo,
[2179.34 → 2181.00] planning to do it without enough research
[2181.00 → 2182.40] to figure out that this person is a scammer.
[2182.62 → 2183.46] Tell me, Josh,
[2184.12 → 2187.04] as a boutique gaming system builder
[2187.04 → 2188.68] who, you know,
[2188.90 → 2190.52] really, you know, wasn't...
[2191.20 → 2191.94] Well, okay, okay.
[2192.02 → 2192.92] Two things, two things.
[2193.00 → 2193.76] Tell me this, Josh.
[2193.76 → 2197.72] How much margin did you make
[2197.72 → 2198.78] selling gaming PCs?
[2200.62 → 2202.92] Oh, hell, like 4,000%.
[2202.92 → 2204.18] 4,000%.
[2204.18 → 2204.36] Okay.
[2204.36 → 2205.06] Because I touched it.
[2205.12 → 2206.76] I mean, I had a picture of me on the side of it,
[2206.80 → 2207.86] which that, I mean, right there,
[2207.94 → 2208.86] that's just a bonus.
[2209.36 → 2211.26] You know, it's a work of art.
[2211.60 → 2213.32] But, yeah, the thing is, like,
[2213.40 → 2214.66] you have to figure, you know,
[2214.70 → 2216.24] I was definitely a high-end boutique,
[2216.24 → 2218.24] so our stuff was, you know,
[2218.30 → 2219.00] very expensive.
[2219.12 → 2220.04] Our average box was, like,
[2220.08 → 2220.96] 8 to 12K.
[2221.44 → 2224.52] So we had sizeable, sizeable margin,
[2224.68 → 2226.04] and we were still at, like,
[2227.52 → 2231.08] 30, 40%, like, above hardware,
[2231.18 → 2232.10] but you also gotta realize
[2232.10 → 2233.86] when you're going into that level of boutique,
[2233.94 → 2235.58] the amount of work that goes into your overclock
[2235.58 → 2236.76] and your stress testing it,
[2236.80 → 2237.66] and it's like that's, you know,
[2237.68 → 2238.98] the labour comes into it.
[2239.46 → 2239.74] Yes.
[2240.26 → 2241.90] And, like, so hold on.
[2241.98 → 2243.46] I'm not talking gross margins.
[2243.62 → 2244.94] I want to hear net margins.
[2244.94 → 2247.10] What happens after you pay yourself labour,
[2247.36 → 2250.00] which probably isn't for that great of a salary?
[2251.30 → 2253.44] Oh, obviously, I was worth so much more.
[2253.58 → 2254.80] That's why I moved on to modelling.
[2255.20 → 2256.64] But, you know, after that dried up,
[2256.68 → 2257.54] I came back to tech.
[2258.20 → 2260.16] You know, so I would say, you know,
[2260.16 → 2260.98] at the end of the day,
[2261.86 → 2262.88] the problem was, too, is, you know,
[2262.90 → 2263.84] I own the company,
[2263.90 → 2265.02] so I started myself, right?
[2265.06 → 2268.98] So I was probably maybe between 10% and 15%.
[2268.98 → 2271.46] 10% and 15% sounds about right.
[2271.54 → 2273.30] Which is not big margin.
[2273.30 → 2274.60] And that's a boutique.
[2274.60 → 2276.10] So to put that in perspective,
[2276.34 → 2279.44] someone like an NCI might be making about half of that.
[2279.78 → 2281.58] So for those of you watching right now
[2281.58 → 2282.74] who think there's, like,
[2282.94 → 2284.94] massive margin in gaming computers,
[2285.40 → 2286.00] there is.
[2286.28 → 2288.04] But it isn't at the retailer level,
[2288.46 → 2290.04] it isn't at the distributor level,
[2290.40 → 2292.68] and it's not at the system builder level.
[2292.80 → 2295.08] It is at the manufacturing level.
[2295.54 → 2298.14] Guys like Asus, guys like Intel,
[2298.38 → 2299.70] these are public companies.
[2300.06 → 2302.32] All you have to do is look at their financials.
[2302.32 → 2303.84] You know how much they're making on it.
[2304.64 → 2308.18] That means that if something costs $1,000 to the end user,
[2308.78 → 2312.98] and we know that the distributor price for it is,
[2313.20 → 2314.94] you know, $950,
[2316.40 → 2319.54] the retailer and the distributor didn't make that much on it.
[2319.54 → 2321.32] So, Josh, tell me this.
[2321.52 → 2323.94] When you were a boutique builder building systems
[2323.94 → 2326.28] that might have cost thousands of dollars
[2326.28 → 2327.72] if you could even find them,
[2328.26 → 2332.42] how much did it cost you to buy an Extreme Edition?
[2333.38 → 2334.56] Oh, let's see here.
[2334.72 → 2336.04] It was pretty straightforward
[2336.04 → 2339.22] because Intel locks their pricing it per 1,000-unit orders, right?
[2339.40 → 2340.04] I mean, it's like,
[2340.10 → 2341.54] the way that breaks down is, like,
[2341.58 → 2343.96] when an Extreme Edition came out back then,
[2343.96 → 2344.84] you know, they're like $1,000.
[2345.28 → 2347.56] And it's like, you know, $999.
[2347.56 → 2348.04] $99.
[2348.60 → 2349.52] Yeah, and it was like,
[2349.60 → 2351.78] that's per 1,000 CPUs.
[2351.82 → 2354.52] And I think people have this unrealistic view of,
[2354.60 → 2355.26] you know,
[2355.28 → 2357.14] how much business a lot of system builders are doing.
[2357.22 → 2359.06] It's like a huge boutique system builder
[2359.06 → 2360.50] may be doing, like,
[2361.18 → 2363.08] between 200 and 400 systems a month.
[2363.52 → 2365.66] You know, and it always killed me.
[2365.72 → 2365.94] It's like,
[2366.04 → 2366.96] people think you're getting, like,
[2366.96 → 2368.34] all this hardware for dirt cheap,
[2368.34 → 2369.64] and we'd always get these things like,
[2370.20 → 2371.60] oh, I want an Extreme Edition.
[2371.72 → 2372.16] I want this,
[2372.22 → 2372.66] I want that,
[2372.72 → 2373.16] and I want this,
[2373.22 → 2373.86] but I want it for, like,
[2373.90 → 2374.52] half a retail
[2374.52 → 2375.96] because I know you guys get it cheap.
[2376.04 → 2376.30] I'm like,
[2376.48 → 2377.74] you know more than I do, man,
[2377.82 → 2379.80] because you're certainly not getting it cheap.
[2380.18 → 2381.42] And that's why we went that route
[2381.42 → 2381.74] is, like,
[2381.78 → 2383.14] to make any margin on it,
[2383.66 → 2383.92] you know,
[2383.96 → 2385.94] you had to put some sort of spin on it.
[2385.96 → 2386.76] You had to do, like,
[2386.84 → 2387.58] overclocking,
[2387.62 → 2388.16] liquid cooling,
[2388.24 → 2388.90] stuff like that
[2388.90 → 2389.74] that people weren't doing.
[2390.40 → 2391.30] And, you know,
[2391.38 → 2391.92] people wonder,
[2392.02 → 2393.14] oh, how come there's always bloatware
[2393.14 → 2394.18] and crapware on PCs?
[2395.06 → 2396.12] That's where Dell and HP
[2396.12 → 2396.64] and the big guys
[2396.64 → 2397.80] made all their money.
[2397.96 → 2398.94] That was all subsidized.
[2399.06 → 2399.12] Like,
[2399.16 → 2400.02] they were selling half the time
[2401.60 → 2403.34] making up the money
[2403.34 → 2403.86] on, like,
[2404.18 → 2404.38] you know,
[2404.44 → 2405.94] Symantec kicking them 20 bucks
[2405.94 → 2406.50] per system.
[2406.78 → 2407.40] Or shipping.
[2407.98 → 2409.64] Or the other little things
[2409.64 → 2410.30] that they could do
[2410.30 → 2411.34] that really helped that.
[2411.50 → 2411.94] Or, you know,
[2411.98 → 2413.10] even things like
[2413.10 → 2414.06] office trials
[2414.06 → 2415.18] that ship on your computer.
[2415.46 → 2416.38] As enthusiasts,
[2416.64 → 2417.46] we kind of look at that
[2417.46 → 2417.78] and we go,
[2417.96 → 2418.32] ha,
[2418.42 → 2419.58] as if I'm going to activate it.
[2419.86 → 2421.38] But someone like my mother
[2421.38 → 2422.42] might actually do that.
[2422.52 → 2423.64] And that's where the margin
[2423.64 → 2424.42] on that PC
[2424.42 → 2425.94] through an affiliate code
[2425.94 → 2426.68] of all things.
[2426.88 → 2427.08] Like,
[2427.08 → 2428.28] even someone like Acer
[2428.28 → 2429.68] has to make money
[2429.68 → 2430.20] through, like,
[2430.20 → 2431.30] an affiliate program
[2431.30 → 2432.56] for Microsoft Office
[2432.56 → 2433.38] on the computer
[2433.38 → 2434.28] that they shipped to you.
[2434.88 → 2435.28] Yeah.
[2435.58 → 2435.82] Well,
[2435.94 → 2436.50] it just,
[2436.58 → 2437.26] it drives me nuts
[2437.26 → 2437.52] that,
[2438.10 → 2438.30] like,
[2438.34 → 2438.98] so these guys
[2438.98 → 2439.80] are obviously
[2439.80 → 2441.02] blatant idiots.
[2441.36 → 2441.74] I mean,
[2442.08 → 2442.72] it's either,
[2443.30 → 2443.94] so first,
[2443.98 → 2444.64] let's just start
[2444.64 → 2445.58] poking holes in this.
[2445.66 → 2446.12] I don't even know
[2446.12 → 2446.64] where to start
[2446.64 → 2447.50] because there's so much
[2447.50 → 2448.02] crap.
[2448.12 → 2448.90] It's insane.
[2449.26 → 2449.44] Like,
[2449.48 → 2449.68] okay,
[2449.68 → 2450.28] first,
[2450.82 → 2451.04] you know,
[2451.04 → 2451.50] we found that
[2451.50 → 2452.26] if we buy and bulk,
[2452.42 → 2453.04] we save.
[2453.48 → 2453.62] Gee,
[2453.70 → 2455.02] that's a unique business model
[2455.02 → 2455.86] that I don't know
[2455.86 → 2457.26] Walmart and everybody else
[2457.26 → 2458.18] has had since the beginning
[2458.18 → 2458.64] of time.
[2458.64 → 2459.08] Yeah,
[2459.20 → 2459.92] I bet New egg,
[2460.02 → 2460.92] New egg never figured
[2460.92 → 2461.76] that out about
[2461.76 → 2462.84] buying in bulk
[2462.84 → 2464.00] and getting processors
[2464.00 → 2464.66] for cheaper.
[2465.08 → 2465.30] Yeah,
[2465.38 → 2465.80] exactly.
[2465.92 → 2466.30] It's like,
[2466.36 → 2466.60] ooh,
[2466.62 → 2467.42] I'm glad you guys
[2467.42 → 2468.28] cracked this one
[2468.28 → 2468.84] and no one else
[2468.84 → 2469.20] has been able
[2469.20 → 2469.84] to figure it out.
[2469.96 → 2470.58] And then second of all,
[2470.60 → 2470.90] it's like,
[2471.22 → 2471.94] we started looking,
[2472.00 → 2472.84] we got these contacts
[2472.84 → 2473.60] in the industry.
[2473.60 → 2474.10] It's like,
[2474.20 → 2474.36] ooh,
[2474.42 → 2475.46] that inside track
[2475.46 → 2475.98] that you developed
[2475.98 → 2477.06] after a week and a half
[2477.06 → 2477.80] on Craigslist.
[2478.14 → 2478.30] You know,
[2478.36 → 2479.28] I don't know exactly
[2479.28 → 2479.78] where they think
[2479.78 → 2480.78] they got all this information.
[2481.54 → 2482.38] And then the other thing
[2482.38 → 2482.60] is,
[2482.90 → 2483.28] it's like,
[2483.34 → 2484.68] if we can crowdfund this,
[2484.74 → 2485.50] if we can all order
[2485.50 → 2486.24] these motherboards
[2486.24 → 2487.12] and these video cards,
[2487.20 → 2487.54] it's like,
[2487.92 → 2488.16] okay,
[2488.18 → 2488.60] what motherboard
[2488.60 → 2489.04] am I getting?
[2489.82 → 2490.04] You know,
[2490.08 → 2490.82] it's like,
[2491.02 → 2491.34] yeah,
[2491.70 → 2492.06] you know,
[2492.30 → 2492.52] okay,
[2492.54 → 2493.32] what chipset,
[2493.42 → 2494.32] what manufacturer?
[2494.62 → 2496.00] I think that's the least
[2496.00 → 2497.28] of the holes in this.
[2497.62 → 2497.76] Oh,
[2497.78 → 2497.90] yeah.
[2497.90 → 2498.96] That's a big hole though,
[2499.06 → 2499.46] but yeah,
[2499.50 → 2499.86] I agree.
[2500.20 → 2500.38] Yeah,
[2500.46 → 2500.64] like,
[2500.76 → 2501.76] what importance is it?
[2501.88 → 2502.24] Okay,
[2502.42 → 2503.38] like another reason why,
[2503.46 → 2503.74] you know,
[2503.80 → 2504.56] any system builder
[2504.56 → 2505.76] has to make margin on it,
[2505.78 → 2506.04] it's like,
[2506.38 → 2507.16] who's going to support
[2507.16 → 2507.78] the damn thing?
[2508.54 → 2508.66] You know,
[2508.74 → 2509.78] it looks to me,
[2509.78 → 2511.58] I'm going to give them
[2511.58 → 2512.44] the benefit of the doubt.
[2513.82 → 2515.78] I think that they're not scammers,
[2516.18 → 2517.42] I think that they're morons,
[2517.84 → 2518.88] and what they think
[2518.88 → 2521.26] is that if they get,
[2522.04 → 2522.68] because look,
[2522.92 → 2523.82] they're asking for
[2523.82 → 2526.30] a half a million dollar goal,
[2526.92 → 2527.98] and their campaign
[2527.98 → 2530.20] only receives funds
[2530.20 → 2531.52] if they reach it
[2531.52 → 2532.08] by the deadline.
[2532.28 → 2533.36] So it's not one of those
[2533.36 → 2534.44] blatant scam ones
[2534.44 → 2534.92] where they're like,
[2534.98 → 2535.12] yeah,
[2535.14 → 2535.68] we're going to keep
[2535.68 → 2536.40] the money regardless.
[2536.40 → 2538.24] So I think that they
[2538.24 → 2539.78] naively think
[2539.78 → 2541.90] that if they manage
[2541.90 → 2542.80] to put together
[2542.80 → 2545.72] 500 systems
[2545.72 → 2547.26] as a single order,
[2547.52 → 2548.42] that they'll be able
[2548.42 → 2549.26] to go to someone
[2549.26 → 2550.10] like Intel
[2550.10 → 2551.94] or VGA
[2551.94 → 2552.68] or Asus
[2552.68 → 2553.56] or whoever else
[2553.56 → 2553.92] and say,
[2554.04 → 2554.20] hey,
[2554.52 → 2555.48] we're big shots,
[2555.94 → 2556.90] drop your pants
[2556.90 → 2557.76] in terms of pricing
[2557.76 → 2558.36] for us,
[2558.82 → 2559.12] and,
[2559.18 → 2559.70] you know,
[2559.74 → 2561.02] $1,000 is our budget,
[2561.14 → 2561.98] and that's a lot of money
[2561.98 → 2563.58] because we're 15
[2563.58 → 2564.80] and we're however old
[2564.80 → 2565.16] they are,
[2565.24 → 2565.70] and we think,
[2566.02 → 2566.30] whatever.
[2566.48 → 2567.38] They think that $1,000
[2567.38 → 2568.40] is a lot of money,
[2569.06 → 2571.68] and they think
[2571.68 → 2572.52] that they can achieve
[2572.52 → 2573.08] it that way,
[2573.14 → 2573.66] and it's just not
[2573.66 → 2574.02] going to work.
[2574.28 → 2575.04] Josh has built systems
[2575.04 → 2576.54] for people on an insane level.
[2576.72 → 2577.38] You've built systems
[2577.38 → 2577.74] for people.
[2577.84 → 2578.50] I've built systems
[2578.50 → 2578.96] for people.
[2579.74 → 2580.24] None of us made
[2580.24 → 2581.14] a ton of money off it.
[2581.42 → 2582.16] The first thing
[2582.16 → 2582.74] that I say
[2582.74 → 2583.82] anytime someone posts
[2583.82 → 2584.42] on the forum
[2584.42 → 2585.22] that their plan
[2585.22 → 2586.76] is to start a business
[2586.76 → 2587.76] selling systems
[2587.76 → 2589.88] is done it for fun.
[2590.14 → 2591.20] It better be a side job
[2591.20 → 2592.12] and it better be entertaining.
[2592.78 → 2592.94] Yes.
[2593.04 → 2593.18] I mean,
[2593.32 → 2594.48] the overhead in it
[2594.48 → 2595.16] is ridiculous.
[2595.16 → 2596.86] Aside from
[2596.86 → 2598.42] just the standard
[2598.42 → 2599.10] business model,
[2599.20 → 2600.24] it's like keeping up
[2600.24 → 2601.14] with high-end hardware.
[2601.94 → 2603.38] Working in front
[2603.38 → 2603.88] of the curve
[2603.88 → 2605.62] is ridiculously
[2605.62 → 2606.82] time-consuming.
[2606.82 → 2608.50] By the time
[2608.50 → 2609.90] the extreme edition drops,
[2610.02 → 2610.78] if you're one of the
[2610.78 → 2611.84] high-end guys,
[2611.92 → 2612.52] it's like you're already
[2612.52 → 2613.50] working on the next thing.
[2613.90 → 2614.70] By the time it actually
[2614.70 → 2615.38] comes to market,
[2615.50 → 2615.64] you're like,
[2615.70 → 2616.46] okay, that's old.
[2617.14 → 2618.08] I have to agree.
[2618.24 → 2618.74] I don't think
[2618.74 → 2619.64] these guys are scammers
[2619.64 → 2621.24] merely because
[2621.24 → 2623.12] a scam would be put together
[2623.12 → 2624.20] a lot better than this.
[2624.66 → 2626.04] This is so bad.
[2626.14 → 2627.24] It's got to be
[2627.24 → 2628.74] blatantly real.
[2628.88 → 2629.94] They genuinely think
[2629.94 → 2630.66] that they've stumbled
[2630.66 → 2631.50] across something
[2631.50 → 2632.76] and that they're
[2632.76 → 2633.26] going to be able
[2633.26 → 2634.26] to help people out.
[2634.36 → 2634.70] It's like,
[2634.74 → 2634.98] you know,
[2635.10 → 2636.02] a scam would
[2636.02 → 2638.02] be more believable,
[2638.22 → 2638.58] I think.
[2638.72 → 2639.84] That's how a scam works.
[2640.84 → 2642.28] I wonder about
[2642.28 → 2643.24] the four people
[2643.24 → 2644.00] who have evidently
[2644.00 → 2644.40] bought it.
[2644.50 → 2645.04] And they've got
[2645.04 → 2645.90] a lot of perks
[2645.90 → 2646.92] at different levels
[2646.92 → 2648.32] that I'm also looking at
[2648.32 → 2648.86] going like,
[2648.86 → 2649.60] are you guys
[2649.60 → 2650.56] bloody insane?
[2651.06 → 2651.46] $25
[2651.46 → 2653.42] for a 256-gig
[2653.42 → 2654.34] USB drive?
[2655.34 → 2655.86] $250
[2655.86 → 2657.04] for a Sony 990.
[2657.16 → 2657.86] That was the main one
[2657.86 → 2658.32] that got me.
[2658.46 → 2659.40] Yeah, it's like,
[2659.52 → 2660.84] okay, on what planet?
[2660.92 → 2661.50] When are you planning
[2661.50 → 2662.60] to ship these systems?
[2663.14 → 2663.78] Like, if they're planning
[2663.78 → 2664.58] to ship the system
[2664.58 → 2665.40] in 2016
[2665.40 → 2666.44] and they're just
[2666.44 → 2666.90] going to, like,
[2667.00 → 2667.56] troll eBay,
[2667.72 → 2668.38] okay, they're planning
[2668.38 → 2669.24] to ship them in October.
[2669.58 → 2670.46] But if the plan
[2670.46 → 2671.02] was to, like,
[2671.08 → 2671.72] troll eBay
[2671.72 → 2672.92] two years from now
[2672.92 → 2674.38] and dig up, like,
[2674.82 → 2675.16] you know,
[2675.24 → 2676.30] old extreme editions
[2676.30 → 2676.86] and stuff,
[2676.92 → 2677.86] this might be doable.
[2678.44 → 2679.22] Well, here's the thing.
[2679.26 → 2679.98] If they got all the parts
[2679.98 → 2680.30] right now,
[2680.40 → 2680.90] two guys,
[2680.98 → 2681.58] it would take them
[2681.58 → 2682.10] until October
[2682.10 → 2683.22] to build a 500 system.
[2683.64 → 2683.84] I mean,
[2683.84 → 2684.36] do they ever think
[2684.36 → 2684.84] about that?
[2684.88 → 2685.20] It's like,
[2685.28 → 2686.04] oh, we're going to have
[2686.04 → 2686.44] to hire some people
[2686.44 → 2687.10] to build all these
[2687.10 → 2687.72] by October.
[2687.86 → 2688.88] From watching the video,
[2689.02 → 2689.88] I think it's only
[2689.88 → 2690.92] the dude on the right
[2690.92 → 2691.60] who's building
[2691.60 → 2692.78] all of them, actually.
[2692.96 → 2693.24] Oh, yeah,
[2693.24 → 2693.72] the other guys
[2693.72 → 2694.82] the brains behind it.
[2694.88 → 2695.26] There we go.
[2695.32 → 2695.90] That's a solid,
[2696.06 → 2696.44] that's a solid.
[2696.44 → 2697.14] And if you build
[2697.14 → 2698.40] 500 systems,
[2698.50 → 2699.34] I can tell you
[2699.34 → 2700.00] right now,
[2700.30 → 2701.16] based on sort of
[2701.16 → 2702.30] an industry standard
[2702.30 → 2704.08] two to three percent
[2704.08 → 2705.18] defective rate
[2705.18 → 2706.58] on any component
[2706.58 → 2707.94] within the first month,
[2708.40 → 2709.00] they are going
[2709.00 → 2709.66] to get back
[2709.66 → 2710.82] so it compounds, right,
[2711.08 → 2711.52] because you're
[2711.52 → 2712.24] building a system.
[2712.36 → 2712.78] So let's say
[2712.78 → 2713.62] a system has
[2713.62 → 2714.36] eight components
[2714.36 → 2715.10] in it for the sake
[2715.10 → 2715.56] of argument.
[2715.94 → 2716.60] That means that
[2716.60 → 2717.22] the chances
[2717.22 → 2718.34] of a system
[2718.34 → 2719.26] going defective
[2719.26 → 2720.58] within 30 days,
[2720.98 → 2721.72] unless they're
[2721.72 → 2722.46] burning them in,
[2722.54 → 2722.74] I mean,
[2722.78 → 2723.84] what about the power
[2723.84 → 2724.32] that it's going
[2724.32 → 2724.72] to consume
[2724.72 → 2725.18] to burn in
[2725.18 → 2725.86] all these systems?
[2725.94 → 2726.28] They're building
[2726.28 → 2727.08] 500 systems
[2727.08 → 2727.72] at the same time.
[2728.00 → 2728.36] Anyway,
[2728.80 → 2729.80] the chance
[2729.80 → 2730.36] that one of them
[2730.36 → 2731.48] will be defective
[2731.48 → 2732.60] within 30 days
[2732.60 → 2733.34] is probably
[2733.34 → 2734.30] at least
[2734.30 → 2736.00] three to five percent
[2736.00 → 2737.44] if they're lucky
[2737.44 → 2738.60] as an inexperienced
[2738.60 → 2738.90] builder,
[2739.02 → 2739.72] never mind the ones
[2739.72 → 2740.38] that get damaged
[2740.38 → 2740.94] in shipping.
[2741.50 → 2741.84] Tell me,
[2741.92 → 2742.18] Josh,
[2742.26 → 2742.96] how much do
[2742.96 → 2744.30] RMA's cost you
[2744.30 → 2745.24] as a system builder?
[2745.92 → 2746.32] Oh, yeah,
[2746.42 → 2747.02] well, that's the thing.
[2747.14 → 2747.32] You know,
[2747.34 → 2748.68] it's ridiculously expensive
[2748.68 → 2749.82] because say you sell
[2749.82 → 2750.44] the whole system.
[2751.14 → 2751.24] You know,
[2751.24 → 2751.94] the first thing is
[2751.94 → 2752.44] it's like,
[2752.62 → 2753.54] I think my video card
[2753.54 → 2753.74] died.
[2753.88 → 2754.04] Okay,
[2754.10 → 2754.32] we'll see you
[2754.32 → 2754.74] in the video card.
[2754.84 → 2755.78] I don't know how to fix it.
[2755.92 → 2756.40] They want to send
[2756.40 → 2757.24] the whole system back.
[2757.80 → 2758.14] So, yeah,
[2758.20 → 2759.34] assuming you can
[2759.34 → 2760.56] sidestep that,
[2761.32 → 2761.64] it's,
[2762.00 → 2762.42] the other thing is
[2762.42 → 2762.86] if they're working
[2762.86 → 2763.72] with high-end hardware,
[2763.88 → 2764.58] we had our largest
[2764.58 → 2765.22] failure rates
[2765.22 → 2766.54] on enthusiast-classed hardware.
[2767.10 → 2767.50] Of course you did.
[2767.50 → 2769.12] Because it's pushed so high.
[2769.60 → 2769.76] You know,
[2769.80 → 2770.62] and you would think,
[2770.74 → 2771.72] which they're probably thinking
[2771.72 → 2772.72] from a general mindset,
[2772.88 → 2772.98] like,
[2773.34 → 2773.46] oh,
[2773.50 → 2774.26] this video card,
[2774.30 → 2775.18] it costs three times
[2775.18 → 2776.26] as much as a mainstream one.
[2776.34 → 2777.08] It's going to be perfect.
[2777.18 → 2777.40] It's like,
[2777.48 → 2777.68] no,
[2777.76 → 2778.36] it's probably going
[2778.36 → 2778.92] to be flaky.
[2779.56 → 2779.78] You know,
[2779.86 → 2780.96] and if you're going
[2780.96 → 2781.52] to take all these,
[2781.58 → 2782.62] you're going to overclock them.
[2782.74 → 2782.88] Okay,
[2782.94 → 2783.60] add to that.
[2783.66 → 2784.24] That's the other thing.
[2784.32 → 2784.40] You know,
[2784.40 → 2784.72] you're looking at
[2784.72 → 2785.46] your failure rate.
[2786.14 → 2787.04] I assume these guys
[2787.04 → 2787.46] are going to get in
[2787.46 → 2788.18] trying to overclock
[2788.18 → 2789.32] because they'll read on that
[2789.32 → 2790.92] on some forum somewhere.
[2791.06 → 2791.18] Hey,
[2791.20 → 2791.70] I can do that.
[2791.78 → 2793.26] All you do is push the voltage
[2793.26 → 2794.12] as high as it goes
[2794.12 → 2794.92] and then just crank up
[2794.92 → 2795.36] the multiplier.
[2795.74 → 2795.84] Yeah.
[2799.84 → 2800.24] Oh,
[2800.88 → 2801.40] yeah.
[2801.70 → 2801.84] Yeah,
[2801.84 → 2803.00] I could rage on this all night,
[2803.08 → 2803.46] but you know,
[2803.56 → 2804.20] if you want to move on,
[2804.24 → 2804.86] I totally understand.
[2805.00 → 2805.58] I just saw it
[2805.58 → 2806.06] and I was like,
[2806.16 → 2806.46] really,
[2806.70 → 2807.04] really,
[2807.16 → 2807.64] this is,
[2808.18 → 2809.26] and the scariest thing
[2809.26 → 2810.86] is that they've got backers
[2810.86 → 2811.34] already.
[2811.58 → 2811.62] Like,
[2811.82 → 2812.04] oh.
[2812.12 → 2812.50] I know.
[2812.98 → 2814.02] Is it like their moms?
[2814.24 → 2815.36] I'm hoping so.
[2815.62 → 2816.56] I'm hoping so.
[2817.02 → 2817.48] Could be.
[2817.86 → 2818.54] Considering the money
[2818.54 → 2819.22] we'll get back
[2819.22 → 2820.08] if they don't get it funded,
[2820.22 → 2821.02] it definitely could be.
[2821.36 → 2822.16] Another thing is,
[2822.24 → 2822.70] I think,
[2823.06 → 2823.22] okay,
[2823.24 → 2823.94] the guy on the right,
[2823.94 → 2824.72] I watched the video,
[2825.04 → 2826.12] I didn't pay way too much attention,
[2826.24 → 2826.88] but the guy on the right,
[2826.94 → 2827.34] I believe,
[2827.42 → 2828.28] is the technical guy
[2828.28 → 2829.02] and the guy on the left,
[2829.10 → 2829.36] I believe,
[2829.44 → 2830.16] is the business guy.
[2830.40 → 2831.04] The guy on the left
[2831.04 → 2831.68] should be fired.
[2832.48 → 2832.80] Unfortunately,
[2833.30 → 2834.00] the guy on the left
[2834.00 → 2835.10] is going to have a really hard time
[2835.10 → 2835.76] finding a job
[2835.76 → 2837.00] if anyone Googles this
[2837.00 → 2837.64] because his name
[2837.64 → 2839.14] is attached all over it
[2839.14 → 2840.56] and the guy on the right
[2840.56 → 2841.08] is going to have
[2841.08 → 2842.18] a really hard time
[2842.18 → 2842.68] finding a job
[2842.68 → 2843.36] because I believe
[2843.36 → 2844.12] his name is attached
[2844.12 → 2844.76] to this as well.
[2845.04 → 2845.96] So if they try to look
[2845.96 → 2846.38] for a job
[2846.38 → 2847.82] in 22 days from now
[2847.82 → 2848.80] when this fails,
[2849.34 → 2850.38] it's going to be rough
[2850.38 → 2851.76] if anyone Googles their names.
[2851.86 → 2852.40] I think it,
[2852.52 → 2853.36] I think you're giving them
[2853.36 → 2854.24] too much credit
[2854.24 → 2855.16] for the size
[2855.16 → 2855.68] and momentum
[2855.68 → 2856.52] of this project.
[2857.12 → 2858.20] I don't think anyone
[2858.20 → 2859.20] will ever find it.
[2859.98 → 2860.70] My thing is,
[2860.76 → 2861.34] I thought it was,
[2861.48 → 2862.72] it was better
[2862.72 → 2863.78] without the video.
[2864.00 → 2864.22] Like,
[2864.24 → 2864.98] I watched the video
[2864.98 → 2865.84] and it got worse.
[2866.28 → 2867.38] Oh my God.
[2867.74 → 2869.14] I see what you're trying to do,
[2869.34 → 2869.60] but,
[2869.72 → 2870.04] oh,
[2870.10 → 2871.56] just fail left and right.
[2871.78 → 2872.64] I should tell them
[2872.64 → 2873.44] if they want to do
[2873.44 → 2874.30] a better pitch video
[2874.30 → 2874.82] next time,
[2874.88 → 2875.48] they should reach out
[2875.48 → 2876.38] to Linus Media Group.
[2876.38 → 2876.46] They should.
[2877.12 → 2878.32] And we should just,
[2878.48 → 2879.50] just for loss,
[2879.56 → 2880.34] we should just produce
[2880.34 → 2881.84] the stupidest possible pitch.
[2881.96 → 2882.58] You know what?
[2882.62 → 2883.26] That would be kind of
[2883.26 → 2884.08] a fun project.
[2884.50 → 2884.88] Like,
[2885.20 → 2886.52] Indiegogo pitch video,
[2887.10 → 2887.46] like,
[2887.54 → 2888.54] fake sort of thing.
[2888.60 → 2888.94] I don't know
[2888.94 → 2890.06] if that's been overdone yet.
[2890.28 → 2890.82] We kind of,
[2890.98 → 2891.56] sort of,
[2892.42 → 2892.94] did it,
[2893.02 → 2894.34] but not for jokes
[2894.34 → 2894.74] and not,
[2894.80 → 2895.58] and it wasn't fake,
[2895.70 → 2896.28] but for,
[2896.36 → 2896.80] um,
[2897.52 → 2897.74] the
[2897.80 → 2899.02] the Kickstarter one
[2899.02 → 2899.42] that we did.
[2899.84 → 2900.62] We did the Kickstarter?
[2900.98 → 2901.30] Uh,
[2901.42 → 2901.64] it got,
[2901.74 → 2901.92] no,
[2901.98 → 2902.34] we didn't do a Kickstarter.
[2902.34 → 2902.92] I didn't get any
[2902.92 → 2903.40] of the money from it.
[2903.40 → 2903.92] We did a video
[2903.92 → 2904.48] that got posted
[2904.48 → 2904.94] on Kickstarter
[2904.94 → 2905.82] for that thing.
[2905.94 → 2906.20] Oh,
[2906.46 → 2906.74] for,
[2906.74 → 2906.84] for,
[2906.84 → 2907.20] uh,
[2907.28 → 2907.58] I can't remember
[2907.58 → 2907.98] the name of it.
[2908.28 → 2908.64] Omni.
[2908.80 → 2909.08] Omni.
[2909.20 → 2909.34] Yeah,
[2909.40 → 2909.98] for Tricks Omni.
[2910.04 → 2910.66] That got posted
[2910.66 → 2911.22] on there.
[2911.56 → 2912.14] Kickstarter didn't work
[2912.14 → 2912.58] really well,
[2912.66 → 2913.24] so I don't know.
[2913.36 → 2913.60] Okay,
[2913.68 → 2914.08] so anyway,
[2914.18 → 2914.64] there you go.
[2914.94 → 2915.28] You know what?
[2915.32 → 2915.90] Why don't we move
[2915.90 → 2916.76] into something else?
[2916.88 → 2917.62] I'd like to do
[2917.62 → 2918.22] one topic,
[2918.32 → 2918.96] and in the meantime,
[2919.18 → 2919.50] guys,
[2919.76 → 2920.58] hit us on Twitter
[2920.58 → 2921.62] at Linus Tech,
[2922.08 → 2924.14] and let us know
[2924.14 → 2925.06] what questions
[2925.06 → 2925.74] or comments
[2925.74 → 2926.82] you have for Josh.
[2926.86 → 2927.22] Remember,
[2927.66 → 2928.30] former boutique
[2928.30 → 2928.98] system builder,
[2928.98 → 2930.42] current VP of marketing
[2930.42 → 2931.30] at Fractal Design
[2931.30 → 2932.20] for North America,
[2932.68 → 2933.20] and let's,
[2933.20 → 2933.50] And always awesome.
[2933.96 → 2934.42] I'm sorry,
[2934.46 → 2934.56] what?
[2934.94 → 2935.84] And I'm always awesome.
[2936.06 → 2936.98] And always awesome.
[2937.30 → 2937.82] And you're right,
[2937.86 → 2938.64] I googled his name
[2938.64 → 2939.60] and nothing came up.
[2940.16 → 2940.44] Yeah,
[2940.68 → 2941.48] that,
[2941.48 → 2941.98] that was,
[2942.04 → 2942.62] that was not
[2942.62 → 2943.26] going to be a thing.
[2943.76 → 2943.96] Um,
[2944.22 → 2944.62] all right,
[2944.68 → 2945.32] so Josh,
[2945.38 → 2946.50] speaking of staying
[2946.50 → 2947.80] on the sort of
[2947.80 → 2948.68] bleeding edge
[2948.68 → 2950.36] of CPU technology
[2950.36 → 2950.96] and all that
[2950.96 → 2951.74] crazy stuff,
[2951.92 → 2952.80] here's an article
[2952.80 → 2954.44] from WCCF Tech.
[2955.40 → 2955.84] I mean,
[2956.02 → 2956.70] these guys,
[2956.84 → 2957.04] I don't,
[2957.16 → 2957.30] uh,
[2957.36 → 2958.10] the credibility
[2958.10 → 2959.06] is sort of,
[2959.24 → 2960.12] I mean,
[2960.14 → 2960.86] they had an article
[2960.86 → 2961.32] about,
[2961.40 → 2962.06] I think it was like
[2962.06 → 2963.88] 12 or 16 core FX's
[2963.88 → 2964.90] not that long ago,
[2965.02 → 2966.36] and now there's one
[2966.36 → 2967.72] about how they're
[2967.72 → 2969.06] possibly abandoning
[2969.06 → 2970.14] FX processors,
[2970.38 → 2972.86] Apus all the way.
[2973.54 → 2974.34] What's your take
[2974.34 → 2974.86] on this?
[2976.38 → 2976.90] Oh,
[2977.10 → 2977.68] you know,
[2977.80 → 2978.88] I don't know.
[2979.02 → 2979.30] I mean,
[2979.30 → 2980.12] it gets to a point
[2980.12 → 2980.50] almost,
[2980.72 → 2981.20] uh,
[2981.36 → 2981.80] you know,
[2982.14 → 2984.32] with the big guys
[2984.32 → 2985.38] that you believe anything.
[2985.88 → 2986.12] I mean,
[2986.12 → 2986.86] things have gone back
[2986.86 → 2987.80] and forth so much.
[2988.46 → 2988.68] Yeah,
[2988.70 → 2989.58] I know APU's definitely
[2989.58 → 2990.70] a focus for AMD
[2990.70 → 2991.26] right now.
[2991.74 → 2992.54] As far as like
[2992.54 → 2993.42] abandoning FX,
[2993.76 → 2994.98] I don't see it
[2994.98 → 2996.08] being that drastic.
[2997.28 → 2998.92] If you look at the benchmarks,
[2999.04 → 2999.42] you look at like
[2999.42 → 3000.02] a lot of the forms,
[3000.12 → 3000.94] you would think that
[3000.94 → 3002.68] AMD is completely screwed
[3002.68 → 3003.80] because they don't win
[3003.80 → 3004.50] all the benchmarks.
[3004.68 → 3005.00] But like,
[3005.06 → 3005.90] when you look at,
[3005.96 → 3006.12] you know,
[3006.12 → 3006.86] the buying public,
[3007.00 → 3007.10] like,
[3007.24 → 3007.34] hey,
[3007.38 → 3008.76] that's a cheap processor.
[3009.10 → 3009.80] I'll get that
[3009.80 → 3010.38] for my next build.
[3010.44 → 3011.24] That'll do what I need it
[3011.24 → 3011.52] to do.
[3011.60 → 3012.10] If I'm going to build,
[3012.24 → 3013.22] you know,
[3013.22 → 3014.32] my mother,
[3014.54 → 3014.96] an internet,
[3014.96 → 3015.98] an email machine,
[3015.98 → 3016.40] it's like,
[3016.46 → 3016.66] okay,
[3016.66 → 3017.02] fine.
[3017.28 → 3017.44] Yeah,
[3017.44 → 3018.18] I'm going to go for that.
[3018.40 → 3019.24] And I think that's
[3019.24 → 3020.30] called the Xbox One.
[3020.64 → 3020.92] Yeah,
[3021.02 → 3021.66] exactly.
[3022.56 → 3023.06] So yeah,
[3023.10 → 3023.70] I don't know.
[3023.88 → 3025.32] I don't put a lot of stock
[3025.32 → 3025.68] in it.
[3025.78 → 3026.08] I mean,
[3026.12 → 3026.54] it's,
[3026.90 → 3027.54] that's the other thing.
[3027.54 → 3027.90] Okay,
[3028.02 → 3028.20] like,
[3028.26 → 3028.60] what are the odds
[3028.60 → 3029.52] that website would have
[3029.52 → 3030.16] to scoop if that's
[3030.16 → 3030.90] what was really happening?
[3032.10 → 3032.84] You know what?
[3032.90 → 3034.54] I'm going to play devil's advocate here
[3034.54 → 3035.24] and I'm going to say
[3035.24 → 3035.98] I think they're right
[3035.98 → 3037.72] because they've been
[3037.72 → 3038.70] falling behind.
[3038.96 → 3039.18] I mean,
[3039.24 → 3040.36] performance per watt,
[3040.54 → 3042.12] Option walked in
[3042.12 → 3043.34] and destroyed everything.
[3043.98 → 3045.64] AMD owned fabs at the time.
[3045.82 → 3047.14] They owned the technology.
[3047.14 → 3049.64] They had some serious business.
[3050.52 → 3052.28] I don't know if you want to call it
[3052.28 → 3053.50] planning or luck
[3053.50 → 3054.96] or whatever word you want to use,
[3055.44 → 3056.84] but Intel was basically
[3056.84 → 3057.86] sitting on their butts
[3057.86 → 3058.84] and AMD came in
[3058.84 → 3059.58] and whooped their butts
[3059.58 → 3060.50] in the server space,
[3060.84 → 3061.90] trickled that technology
[3061.90 → 3063.12] down to the desktop
[3063.12 → 3065.08] and kicked some butt
[3065.08 → 3065.78] for a little while.
[3067.22 → 3067.74] Now,
[3067.96 → 3068.78] they haven't done that
[3068.78 → 3069.66] in a long time.
[3071.70 → 3073.66] AMD is more focused
[3073.66 → 3075.82] on that mainstream consumer
[3075.82 → 3077.74] and you look at what they see
[3077.74 → 3079.84] as the definition of an APU.
[3080.10 → 3081.18] According to AMD,
[3082.48 → 3083.08] Core i3,
[3083.24 → 3083.86] Core i5
[3083.86 → 3085.30] and Core i7 processors
[3085.30 → 3086.02] from Intel
[3086.02 → 3088.12] that have onboard HD graphics
[3088.12 → 3089.24] are Apus.
[3090.02 → 3090.50] So,
[3090.82 → 3092.50] you look at Intel
[3092.50 → 3094.36] where they still have dominance
[3094.36 → 3095.74] when it comes to Leon,
[3095.90 → 3097.84] when it comes to Extreme Edition,
[3098.04 → 3098.86] when it comes to
[3098.86 → 3100.96] workstation grade processors,
[3101.18 → 3102.30] they still have dominance there
[3102.30 → 3103.90] and they're barely paying
[3103.90 → 3104.88] any attention to it.
[3105.48 → 3106.16] For AMD,
[3106.56 → 3107.32] is the overhead
[3107.32 → 3108.64] just too much at this point
[3108.64 → 3109.50] to even bother?
[3109.50 → 3111.12] are they better off
[3111.12 → 3112.24] to just focus
[3112.24 → 3114.60] on the heterogeneous
[3114.60 → 3116.24] CPU architecture,
[3116.24 → 3117.28] or I guess I can't call it
[3117.28 → 3117.88] a CPU any,
[3117.94 → 3119.42] but a heterogeneous architecture
[3119.42 → 3121.32] that uses a CPU
[3121.32 → 3122.84] and a graphics
[3122.84 → 3125.12] type of processing
[3125.12 → 3126.44] in order to achieve
[3126.44 → 3127.90] what it needs to do?
[3127.90 → 3129.16] And are they right
[3129.16 → 3129.86] to bank on that
[3129.86 → 3130.32] in the future?
[3130.42 → 3131.52] Because is it possible
[3131.52 → 3133.06] that a quad-core
[3133.06 → 3134.28] CPU
[3134.28 → 3135.98] with a very powerful
[3135.98 → 3136.80] graphics
[3136.80 → 3138.70] processor on it
[3138.70 → 3139.94] would actually be able
[3139.94 → 3140.66] to outperform
[3140.66 → 3141.44] a more traditional
[3141.44 → 3143.24] six-core or eight-core CPU
[3143.24 → 3145.76] in the tasks
[3145.76 → 3146.26] that we need?
[3146.26 → 3146.64] I mean,
[3146.92 → 3147.68] Diesel the intern
[3147.68 → 3148.70] was complaining to me
[3148.70 → 3149.24] the other day
[3149.24 → 3150.12] that his workstation
[3150.12 → 3151.40] doesn't support Quick Sync
[3151.40 → 3152.76] because now
[3152.76 → 3153.62] that technology
[3153.62 → 3154.80] that uses Intel's
[3154.80 → 3156.02] onboard HD graphics
[3156.02 → 3157.02] to accelerate
[3157.02 → 3158.00] video encoding
[3158.00 → 3159.60] is starting to show up
[3159.60 → 3160.84] in the professional tools.
[3161.36 → 3161.76] And I'm like,
[3161.86 → 3162.76] I thought I built you
[3162.76 → 3164.26] the beastest machine
[3164.26 → 3165.32] with a six-core
[3165.32 → 3166.08] Extreme Edition
[3166.08 → 3166.92] and all this RAM
[3166.92 → 3167.56] and a Squadron
[3167.56 → 3168.54] and you want
[3168.54 → 3169.08] a friggin'
[3169.08 → 3170.32] consumer-grade device
[3170.32 → 3171.54] because we're moving
[3171.54 → 3172.52] towards that being
[3172.52 → 3173.18] more practical
[3173.18 → 3173.88] for the future.
[3174.62 → 3175.82] And it makes sense
[3175.82 → 3176.90] and to be honest,
[3176.98 → 3177.56] with them starting
[3177.56 → 3178.30] to rake in money
[3178.30 → 3179.14] on the console side,
[3179.24 → 3180.40] especially in the next
[3180.40 → 3181.12] upcoming months
[3181.12 → 3182.68] and still bleeding money,
[3183.84 → 3184.94] they released a statement
[3184.94 → 3185.98] recently about how
[3185.98 → 3186.36] they're going to be
[3186.36 → 3187.08] profitable soon.
[3187.18 → 3188.42] Yes, they said next quarter.
[3188.76 → 3189.56] Maybe dropping
[3189.56 → 3190.74] certain segments
[3190.74 → 3191.74] will help them
[3191.74 → 3192.66] be profitable soon.
[3193.62 → 3193.92] Well, you know,
[3193.96 → 3194.74] I think that part of it
[3194.74 → 3195.46] comes into the fact
[3195.46 → 3198.20] that certain product wings
[3198.20 → 3199.34] are just marketing wings.
[3199.82 → 3199.92] You know,
[3200.00 → 3200.20] I mean,
[3200.22 → 3201.26] you look at Halo cards
[3201.26 → 3202.24] and stuff like that
[3202.24 → 3203.14] when you're looking
[3203.14 → 3203.68] at graphics,
[3203.86 → 3204.06] it's like,
[3204.08 → 3204.20] you know,
[3204.22 → 3205.52] Nvidia is not making
[3205.52 → 3206.08] their bank
[3206.08 → 3207.02] on Titans
[3207.02 → 3208.14] and 780s.
[3208.20 → 3208.86] It's amazing
[3208.86 → 3209.78] how many consumers
[3209.78 → 3210.54] think they are,
[3210.66 → 3211.20] but, man,
[3211.34 → 3211.60] guys,
[3211.74 → 3212.26] there's no art.
[3212.78 → 3213.62] It costs five times
[3213.62 → 3215.08] as much as a consumer-grade card
[3215.08 → 3215.56] or, you know,
[3215.62 → 3216.46] a performance card.
[3216.56 → 3216.72] It's like,
[3216.98 → 3217.18] yeah,
[3217.22 → 3218.26] and you sell about,
[3218.44 → 3218.84] what,
[3219.04 → 3220.52] 5% of what you sell
[3220.52 → 3221.02] on the mainstream.
[3221.84 → 3222.66] I think 5%
[3222.66 → 3223.60] is very aggressive.
[3223.80 → 3224.12] Pretty aggressive.
[3224.38 → 3224.60] Yeah,
[3224.72 → 3225.84] and the thing is,
[3225.96 → 3226.12] like,
[3226.20 → 3226.64] so,
[3227.18 → 3227.70] if you're going
[3227.70 → 3228.10] into, like,
[3228.12 → 3229.24] the nuclear arms race
[3229.24 → 3229.76] of graphics,
[3229.76 → 3230.40] it makes sense
[3230.40 → 3231.10] because if you win
[3231.10 → 3231.94] that top rung,
[3232.02 → 3232.26] then you get
[3232.26 → 3233.16] every rung below it.
[3233.16 → 3234.76] So it's more of a marketing investment
[3234.76 → 3235.48] than anything else.
[3236.32 → 3238.66] And when you look at largely
[3238.66 → 3240.32] what the bread and butter,
[3240.42 → 3241.84] what AMD probably sells right now,
[3241.88 → 3242.02] yeah,
[3242.08 → 3243.42] it could make sense
[3243.42 → 3244.26] to, I guess,
[3244.42 → 3244.62] you know,
[3244.62 → 3245.98] kill off the FX brand
[3245.98 → 3246.90] if they want to,
[3247.28 → 3248.64] move more towards an APU
[3248.64 → 3249.98] because it's also about application,
[3250.16 → 3250.28] right?
[3250.28 → 3250.44] I mean,
[3250.44 → 3250.72] it's like,
[3250.72 → 3251.40] if you say,
[3251.50 → 3252.96] when has a faster 0 to 60,
[3253.22 → 3253.50] you know,
[3253.60 → 3254.50] a Ferrari
[3254.50 → 3255.86] or a Ford F-150?
[3256.54 → 3257.56] Everyone's going to say Ferrari.
[3257.68 → 3257.86] It's like,
[3257.86 → 3258.12] okay,
[3258.16 → 3259.16] now do the same thing
[3259.16 → 3259.74] on a muddy road,
[3259.78 → 3261.30] which one has a faster 0 to 60?
[3261.52 → 3262.36] So it's all about
[3262.36 → 3263.70] how you're tasking it.
[3263.72 → 3264.04] Like you said,
[3264.08 → 3264.48] with diesel,
[3264.66 → 3265.30] working with video,
[3265.38 → 3265.72] it's like,
[3266.22 → 3266.46] okay,
[3266.50 → 3266.60] yeah,
[3266.62 → 3267.22] that might have more
[3267.22 → 3268.28] raw processing power,
[3268.34 → 3269.34] but for what I use it for,
[3269.42 → 3270.34] this works better for me.
[3270.96 → 3271.20] Yeah.
[3271.50 → 3271.74] Yeah.
[3272.72 → 3273.44] Although I'm trying
[3273.44 → 3273.88] to get away
[3273.88 → 3275.06] with throwing a Kepler GPU
[3275.06 → 3275.76] in his system
[3275.76 → 3276.70] because he's found
[3276.70 → 3277.60] a really cool plugin
[3277.60 → 3278.26] for Premiere
[3278.26 → 3279.52] that uses CUBA
[3279.52 → 3280.70] to accelerate
[3280.70 → 3282.84] outputting H.264
[3282.84 → 3284.14] using the onboard encoder.
[3284.30 → 3284.66] But you know
[3284.66 → 3285.12] what he wants,
[3285.18 → 3285.32] right?
[3285.98 → 3286.78] He wants a Titan,
[3286.90 → 3287.28] doesn't he?
[3287.28 → 3288.34] And he wants both.
[3288.68 → 3289.36] He wants a Squadron
[3289.36 → 3290.12] and a Titan.
[3290.94 → 3291.30] Diesel,
[3291.46 → 3292.32] are you still here?
[3293.78 → 3294.08] Oh no,
[3294.14 → 3295.18] he's not here today.
[3295.34 → 3296.40] He can use one
[3296.40 → 3296.96] for one thing
[3296.96 → 3297.36] and the other
[3297.36 → 3298.10] for the other thing.
[3298.18 → 3299.36] He wants two graphics cards.
[3300.28 → 3300.56] No.
[3301.02 → 3302.10] If he could do it,
[3302.64 → 3302.92] No,
[3303.00 → 3303.76] I don't even care.
[3303.84 → 3304.40] He's not getting
[3304.40 → 3305.06] two Titans
[3305.06 → 3306.06] in his workstation.
[3306.20 → 3306.22] No,
[3306.22 → 3306.52] he doesn't want
[3306.52 → 3307.10] two Titans.
[3307.32 → 3307.72] Oh,
[3307.88 → 3308.62] I know he wants
[3308.62 → 3309.12] the Squadron.
[3309.52 → 3309.66] Yeah,
[3309.74 → 3310.64] he wants the Squadron
[3310.64 → 3311.32] because he wants
[3311.32 → 3312.04] 10-bit colour.
[3312.80 → 3313.42] And then he wants
[3313.42 → 3314.00] the Titan.
[3315.14 → 3315.84] He's not getting
[3315.84 → 3316.30] the Titan.
[3316.30 → 3317.02] He can have
[3317.02 → 3317.98] like a 770
[3317.98 → 3318.58] or something.
[3318.82 → 3319.62] You're so cheap.
[3319.86 → 3320.44] I know,
[3320.60 → 3321.28] I'm like the worst
[3321.28 → 3321.92] person ever.
[3323.92 → 3324.86] Freaking employees.
[3325.48 → 3325.78] It's like,
[3325.82 → 3326.78] why do I even need them?
[3328.04 → 3328.58] Someone's got to
[3328.58 → 3329.24] make you look good.
[3330.02 → 3330.52] Someone's got to
[3330.52 → 3331.18] produce content
[3331.18 → 3331.86] while he emails you.
[3332.08 → 3332.62] All right,
[3332.68 → 3333.66] let's do a Twitter blitz
[3333.66 → 3333.88] here,
[3333.96 → 3334.32] guys,
[3334.50 → 3335.54] for Cash.
[3336.44 → 3337.36] We're going to focus
[3337.36 → 3338.24] on the questions
[3338.24 → 3338.98] for Cash.
[3340.02 → 3340.94] Look at that.
[3341.04 → 3341.68] There won't be any.
[3341.68 → 3342.32] ARCMIDIAR2,
[3342.40 → 3343.14] it must be because
[3343.14 → 3343.80] of that pre-roll
[3343.80 → 3344.60] advertising you're
[3344.60 → 3345.04] running online
[3345.04 → 3345.92] as Tech Tips videos.
[3347.36 → 3347.72] No,
[3347.78 → 3348.24] it'd probably be
[3348.24 → 3349.38] something effective
[3349.38 → 3350.08] that we're doing.
[3351.86 → 3352.34] All right,
[3352.40 → 3354.10] so Gregory says,
[3354.20 → 3354.74] going for the
[3354.74 → 3355.44] ARCMIDIAR2
[3355.44 → 3356.16] air cooling build,
[3356.24 → 3356.88] should I go for
[3356.88 → 3358.22] AF140 fans
[3358.22 → 3358.96] instead of the
[3358.96 → 3359.66] stock fans?
[3360.10 → 3360.78] Great question.
[3361.54 → 3361.90] Josh,
[3361.96 → 3362.12] go.
[3363.08 → 3363.82] Go for whatever
[3363.82 → 3364.22] you want.
[3364.32 → 3364.50] I mean,
[3364.52 → 3365.72] it comes down to,
[3365.90 → 3366.46] again,
[3366.56 → 3367.04] however you're
[3367.04 → 3367.58] going to use it.
[3367.58 → 3368.00] I mean,
[3368.76 → 3369.46] to think that
[3369.46 → 3370.42] we can make
[3370.42 → 3371.14] one fan that
[3371.14 → 3371.58] would be perfect
[3371.58 → 3372.38] for every solution,
[3372.72 → 3372.98] I mean,
[3373.38 → 3374.24] you could try.
[3374.76 → 3375.32] You know,
[3375.40 → 3376.10] obviously we always
[3376.10 → 3377.54] have an aim
[3377.54 → 3378.34] towards silence
[3378.34 → 3378.92] and that's where
[3378.92 → 3380.26] a lot of our fans
[3380.26 → 3380.78] have come from.
[3380.94 → 3381.22] So,
[3381.82 → 3382.24] if you're going
[3382.24 → 3382.72] for something
[3382.72 → 3383.40] a little more
[3383.40 → 3383.92] high-end,
[3383.98 → 3384.48] if you want to
[3384.48 → 3385.90] do what you
[3385.90 → 3386.38] want to do,
[3386.50 → 3386.78] I mean,
[3386.94 → 3387.74] that's my biggest
[3387.74 → 3387.92] thing.
[3387.98 → 3388.28] I'm not going
[3388.28 → 3388.70] to try and push
[3388.70 → 3389.54] somebody into
[3389.54 → 3389.84] something they
[3389.84 → 3390.24] don't want.
[3391.88 → 3392.44] All right,
[3392.52 → 3393.00] fair enough.
[3393.16 → 3393.70] And you guys
[3393.70 → 3394.18] all know what
[3394.18 → 3394.62] I'll say.
[3394.78 → 3395.42] Buy all the
[3395.42 → 3396.80] Noctua NFF-12s
[3396.80 → 3397.46] because I truly
[3397.46 → 3398.06] believe it is
[3398.06 → 3399.12] the one-size-fits-all.
[3399.32 → 3400.06] And that's why
[3400.06 → 3400.80] I stopped talking
[3400.80 → 3401.30] because I figured
[3401.30 → 3401.96] you'd just chime
[3401.96 → 3402.38] in with that
[3402.38 → 3402.64] anyway,
[3402.80 → 3403.00] so.
[3404.86 → 3405.58] All right,
[3405.74 → 3406.90] that's that same
[3406.90 → 3407.56] question again.
[3407.68 → 3408.20] Will there be
[3408.20 → 3408.90] a successor
[3408.90 → 3410.06] to the Core 1000?
[3410.30 → 3410.74] Actually,
[3410.92 → 3411.64] a case that I
[3411.64 → 3412.36] personally really
[3412.36 → 3412.66] liked.
[3412.74 → 3413.34] I unboxed it
[3413.34 → 3414.44] a long time ago
[3414.44 → 3415.82] and I was
[3415.82 → 3416.76] quite impressed
[3416.76 → 3418.02] by the innovative
[3418.02 → 3419.56] cost savings
[3419.56 → 3420.56] of moving
[3420.56 → 3421.30] the hard drive
[3421.30 → 3421.98] mounting to
[3421.98 → 3422.96] a single slab
[3422.96 → 3423.46] of metal
[3423.46 → 3424.52] as opposed to
[3424.52 → 3424.94] building a
[3424.94 → 3426.00] complicated cage
[3426.00 → 3426.70] while
[3426.70 → 3427.96] offering other
[3427.96 → 3428.48] advantages
[3428.48 → 3429.20] such as
[3429.20 → 3429.90] improved airflow
[3429.90 → 3430.58] through the front
[3430.58 → 3431.08] because you got
[3431.08 → 3431.46] you're friggin'
[3431.52 → 3432.04] drive cage
[3432.04 → 3432.58] out of the way
[3432.58 → 3433.52] and the fact
[3433.52 → 3434.00] that it still
[3434.00 → 3434.46] holds enough
[3434.46 → 3434.82] hardware.
[3434.98 → 3435.32] Are we going
[3435.32 → 3435.78] to see anything
[3435.78 → 3436.44] else like that?
[3438.00 → 3438.36] Yeah,
[3438.44 → 3438.68] okay,
[3438.80 → 3439.82] so now I have
[3439.82 → 3440.24] to do the
[3440.24 → 3441.38] typical disclaimer
[3441.38 → 3442.42] that I cannot
[3442.42 → 3443.28] talk about
[3443.28 → 3443.94] products in the
[3443.94 → 3444.08] air,
[3444.16 → 3444.62] may not be
[3444.62 → 3445.16] released in the
[3445.16 → 3445.62] air future
[3445.62 → 3445.94] and blah,
[3446.00 → 3446.06] blah,
[3446.10 → 3446.18] blah.
[3446.24 → 3446.44] But,
[3446.70 → 3446.98] yeah,
[3447.02 → 3447.44] if you look
[3447.44 → 3447.82] at the rest
[3447.82 → 3448.32] of our product
[3448.32 → 3448.50] line,
[3448.56 → 3448.98] I think you can
[3448.98 → 3449.48] kind of see
[3449.48 → 3449.96] what we tend
[3449.96 → 3450.32] to do.
[3450.44 → 3450.60] I mean,
[3450.64 → 3451.08] we take,
[3451.88 → 3452.06] you know,
[3452.06 → 3452.54] we design our
[3452.54 → 3452.84] cases,
[3452.92 → 3453.52] we take feedback
[3453.52 → 3453.84] from our
[3453.84 → 3454.18] customers
[3454.18 → 3454.76] and from our
[3454.76 → 3455.16] fans,
[3455.28 → 3456.52] and, you know,
[3456.66 → 3458.04] we use that
[3458.04 → 3458.36] to help us
[3458.36 → 3458.70] build new
[3458.70 → 3459.02] products.
[3459.10 → 3459.38] Because, I mean,
[3459.42 → 3460.02] obviously that's
[3460.02 → 3460.52] who we're designing
[3460.52 → 3461.12] this stuff for
[3461.12 → 3461.54] at the end of
[3461.54 → 3461.84] the day.
[3462.68 → 3463.92] So, I would
[3463.92 → 3465.44] say I wouldn't
[3465.44 → 3466.14] be surprised
[3466.14 → 3466.88] at all if you
[3466.88 → 3467.34] saw something
[3467.34 → 3467.76] like that.
[3467.82 → 3468.28] As far as
[3468.28 → 3468.90] time frame,
[3469.00 → 3469.46] no, I don't
[3469.46 → 3469.74] know.
[3469.84 → 3470.24] Have I seen
[3470.24 → 3470.86] anything internally?
[3470.98 → 3471.38] No, I have
[3471.38 → 3471.70] not.
[3472.26 → 3472.52] Okay.
[3472.60 → 3473.60] But the Core 1000
[3473.60 → 3474.66] has been incredibly
[3474.66 → 3475.82] popular for us.
[3475.94 → 3476.90] And it makes you
[3476.90 → 3477.34] look tall.
[3477.34 → 3477.88] So, I mean,
[3477.90 → 3478.16] we've got to
[3478.16 → 3478.54] keep it around
[3478.54 → 3478.76] for a while.
[3478.76 → 3479.00] Thanks.
[3479.48 → 3479.80] I mean,
[3479.82 → 3480.20] the thing about
[3480.20 → 3481.10] the Core 1000
[3481.10 → 3482.54] is keeping it
[3482.54 → 3483.10] within that
[3483.10 → 3483.90] price range,
[3484.14 → 3484.82] I don't know
[3484.82 → 3485.86] how much really
[3485.86 → 3486.78] could be improved.
[3488.32 → 3489.08] We, I mean,
[3489.10 → 3489.60] you do get some
[3489.60 → 3490.08] of that, right?
[3490.14 → 3490.38] I mean,
[3490.38 → 3490.78] it's like,
[3490.84 → 3491.16] oh, we could
[3491.16 → 3491.46] add this,
[3491.54 → 3491.80] we could add
[3491.80 → 3492.02] that.
[3492.08 → 3492.48] The next thing
[3492.48 → 3492.62] you know,
[3492.64 → 3493.74] it's like the
[3493.74 → 3494.40] Core 1000
[3494.40 → 3495.48] at $69.99.
[3495.76 → 3495.92] It's like,
[3496.02 → 3496.22] okay,
[3496.28 → 3496.88] that kind of
[3496.88 → 3497.68] just went the
[3497.68 → 3498.56] opposite direction
[3498.56 → 3499.32] where that case
[3499.32 → 3499.76] was at.
[3500.48 → 3501.52] So, and
[3501.52 → 3502.20] functionality-wise,
[3502.24 → 3502.42] I mean,
[3502.46 → 3503.72] it works very
[3503.72 → 3503.98] well,
[3504.06 → 3504.62] especially in its
[3504.62 → 3505.34] intended market.
[3507.34 → 3508.12] margin anyway,
[3508.26 → 3508.62] that you should
[3508.62 → 3509.22] be able to sell
[3509.22 → 3510.24] Core 1000s
[3510.24 → 3511.24] for $20
[3511.24 → 3512.80] or, you know,
[3512.88 → 3514.14] $16.99 anyway.
[3514.40 → 3514.92] So, you know,
[3514.98 → 3515.54] according to
[3515.54 → 3516.78] those yahoos on that.
[3516.80 → 3517.30] Yeah, well,
[3517.30 → 3517.82] we got a lead
[3517.82 → 3518.42] on some guys
[3518.42 → 3518.68] that we're going
[3518.68 → 3519.86] to buy 500 of them.
[3520.02 → 3520.56] So, we just
[3520.56 → 3521.36] shifted all of our
[3521.36 → 3522.34] pricing towards them.
[3523.62 → 3524.40] Should work out
[3524.40 → 3525.08] for both of us.
[3525.42 → 3526.12] Oh, terrible.
[3527.34 → 3528.34] Linus Tech and Josh,
[3528.38 → 3528.74] do you think
[3528.74 → 3529.16] there will be
[3529.16 → 3530.10] an all-in-one
[3530.10 → 3531.00] boutique system
[3531.00 → 3531.64] made custom
[3531.64 → 3533.20] for some rich people?
[3534.00 → 3534.46] I'm going to
[3534.46 → 3535.44] let you go first.
[3537.34 → 3538.40] An all-in-one?
[3541.04 → 3541.28] Yeah,
[3541.52 → 3541.94] still,
[3542.18 → 3542.86] when it comes back
[3542.86 → 3543.74] to the boutique
[3543.74 → 3544.64] side of things,
[3545.18 → 3545.46] you know,
[3545.52 → 3546.84] I guess what I was
[3546.84 → 3548.20] when I was doing it
[3548.20 → 3548.96] was like the cross
[3548.96 → 3549.68] between like a boutique
[3549.68 → 3550.34] and a fodder,
[3550.76 → 3551.06] you know,
[3551.12 → 3551.68] because people
[3551.68 → 3553.44] back in the day,
[3553.98 → 3554.36] you know,
[3554.52 → 3555.26] like...
[3555.26 → 3556.22] When you were young.
[3556.52 → 3557.26] Yeah, exactly.
[3557.46 → 3557.62] You know,
[3557.64 → 3558.14] when you were making
[3558.14 → 3559.26] cases out of stone,
[3560.26 → 3561.88] it's like people
[3561.88 → 3562.32] didn't come
[3562.32 → 3563.12] in the motherboard
[3563.12 → 3563.34] chair.
[3563.44 → 3563.48] Like,
[3563.48 → 3564.12] we had to do that
[3564.12 → 3564.68] ourselves,
[3564.90 → 3565.14] you know,
[3565.22 → 3566.44] walk uphill both ways
[3566.44 → 3567.22] and all that sort of crap.
[3567.32 → 3567.64] But I mean,
[3568.10 → 3568.60] legitimately,
[3568.80 → 3570.28] it's like there weren't
[3570.28 → 3571.24] a lot of features
[3571.24 → 3571.84] like that.
[3571.98 → 3572.32] So,
[3572.60 → 3574.48] you tried to tailor it
[3574.48 → 3575.66] as much as you could
[3575.66 → 3578.12] to your intended audience.
[3579.40 → 3580.56] All-in-ones get a little
[3580.56 → 3581.16] tricky though.
[3581.66 → 3581.96] I mean,
[3582.06 → 3582.44] it's...
[3583.40 → 3583.86] I don't know.
[3583.96 → 3585.02] It's a very difficult
[3585.02 → 3586.00] form factor
[3586.00 → 3586.64] to deal with.
[3586.70 → 3587.44] It's very difficult to...
[3587.44 → 3589.44] Basically,
[3590.40 → 3591.24] the investment
[3591.24 → 3592.30] that goes into
[3592.30 → 3593.84] designing an all-in-one
[3593.84 → 3594.44] necessitates
[3595.28 → 3596.06] that you sell
[3596.06 → 3597.02] a boatload of them.
[3597.92 → 3598.06] Yeah,
[3598.12 → 3598.50] you basically
[3598.50 → 3599.36] knock out a proprietary
[3599.36 → 3599.78] design.
[3599.88 → 3600.02] It's like,
[3600.06 → 3600.68] why don't you design
[3600.68 → 3601.26] your own laptop
[3601.26 → 3602.54] is about where it's at.
[3603.22 → 3604.10] Pretty much.
[3604.40 → 3604.64] So,
[3604.70 → 3605.02] unless,
[3605.12 → 3605.34] like,
[3605.42 → 3606.32] Steve Wozniak
[3606.32 → 3607.68] decides to build one,
[3607.74 → 3608.04] like,
[3608.12 → 3608.70] for himself,
[3609.42 → 3610.48] I don't think
[3610.48 → 3611.40] it's likely to happen.
[3611.56 → 3611.76] Now,
[3611.86 → 3612.70] I did see
[3612.70 → 3613.80] a gigabyte prototype
[3613.80 → 3614.24] at,
[3614.32 → 3615.04] I think it was
[3615.04 → 3615.74] Computer?
[3616.18 → 3616.58] CES?
[3616.74 → 3617.10] CES.
[3617.20 → 3618.10] Maybe it was at CES.
[3618.24 → 3619.34] That was an all-in-one
[3619.34 → 3620.00] that allowed
[3620.00 → 3621.64] after market graphics
[3621.64 → 3622.30] card upgrades
[3622.30 → 3623.00] with,
[3623.06 → 3623.32] like,
[3623.40 → 3624.72] standard PCI Express
[3624.72 → 3625.34] graphics cards.
[3625.44 → 3625.66] They had,
[3625.78 → 3625.82] like,
[3625.84 → 3626.80] a 580 or something
[3626.80 → 3627.40] stupid in it
[3627.40 → 3627.86] at the time.
[3628.02 → 3628.66] And I was like,
[3628.72 → 3628.86] whoa,
[3628.90 → 3629.58] that's kind of crazy.
[3630.52 → 3631.48] But other than that,
[3631.50 → 3632.52] I haven't really seen much.
[3632.54 → 3633.50] And I really don't think
[3633.50 → 3634.34] anything like that
[3634.34 → 3635.22] will ever be
[3635.22 → 3636.48] wildly successful.
[3638.06 → 3638.42] Yeah,
[3638.48 → 3638.70] plus,
[3638.78 → 3638.90] I mean,
[3638.98 → 3639.50] the people who are going
[3639.50 → 3640.06] to pay that amount
[3640.06 → 3640.40] of money
[3640.40 → 3642.12] for something custom
[3642.12 → 3642.62] aren't,
[3643.30 → 3644.46] at least in my experience
[3644.46 → 3644.92] when we were doing it,
[3644.94 → 3645.72] they weren't so much
[3645.72 → 3646.46] concerned about
[3646.46 → 3647.38] the form factor.
[3647.54 → 3648.14] It was more,
[3648.48 → 3649.86] here's what I want it to do
[3649.86 → 3652.48] or I want to trick it out
[3652.48 → 3653.18] and have this custom
[3653.18 → 3654.02] paint job on it
[3654.02 → 3654.66] and I want to have
[3654.66 → 3655.52] more of, like,
[3655.52 → 3656.24] a look to it
[3656.24 → 3656.70] but not so much
[3656.70 → 3657.48] a form factor.
[3658.24 → 3658.86] All right,
[3658.92 → 3659.48] here we go.
[3659.78 → 3660.06] Josh,
[3660.12 → 3660.94] what did you major
[3660.94 → 3661.64] in college?
[3663.50 → 3663.86] Oh,
[3663.94 → 3664.80] let's see here.
[3665.00 → 3666.04] Did I go to college?
[3666.28 → 3667.10] Other than modelling.
[3667.62 → 3668.48] Other than modelling,
[3668.62 → 3669.74] I major in that every day.
[3670.06 → 3670.16] I mean,
[3670.16 → 3670.92] I wake up,
[3670.92 → 3672.18] first thing I do
[3672.18 → 3672.48] is,
[3672.90 → 3673.26] I mean,
[3673.58 → 3673.80] well,
[3673.80 → 3674.26] I'm awesome
[3674.26 → 3674.90] when I get out of bed.
[3674.96 → 3675.24] I'm awesome
[3675.24 → 3675.72] when I go to bed.
[3675.80 → 3675.94] Yeah,
[3676.00 → 3676.56] I'm pretty much
[3676.56 → 3677.24] awesome all day.
[3677.98 → 3678.18] Now,
[3678.28 → 3678.84] in college,
[3679.02 → 3679.94] believe it or not,
[3680.30 → 3681.14] and if you watched
[3681.14 → 3681.90] the first live stream
[3681.90 → 3682.18] I was on,
[3682.20 → 3682.64] you got a little bit
[3682.64 → 3683.14] of hint at this.
[3683.24 → 3684.00] I actually majored
[3684.00 → 3684.84] in criminology
[3684.84 → 3685.60] and criminal justice
[3685.60 → 3686.82] and then I kind of
[3686.82 → 3687.62] accidentally pepper sprayed
[3687.62 → 3688.26] a bunch of people.
[3691.68 → 3692.66] Which actually was,
[3692.66 → 3693.76] was kind of related
[3693.76 → 3694.38] to my major,
[3694.54 → 3694.74] so,
[3695.14 → 3695.88] so that's all good.
[3696.94 → 3698.34] That's like me saying
[3698.34 → 3699.28] that I,
[3699.62 → 3700.16] like,
[3700.68 → 3702.14] broke my mom's laptop
[3702.14 → 3702.94] and that's somehow
[3702.94 → 3704.20] related to my job.
[3704.98 → 3705.94] You don't have a job,
[3706.06 → 3706.22] man.
[3706.76 → 3707.02] I mean,
[3707.04 → 3708.14] you just kind of sit there
[3708.14 → 3708.38] and then,
[3708.38 → 3708.56] like,
[3708.60 → 3709.46] you get all pouty
[3709.46 → 3710.28] when someone argues
[3710.28 → 3710.62] with you
[3710.62 → 3711.18] and then you change
[3711.18 → 3711.56] the subject.
[3713.84 → 3714.82] I think we're going
[3714.82 → 3715.38] to move on to,
[3715.38 → 3715.50] well,
[3715.50 → 3715.84] actually,
[3715.96 → 3716.26] you know what?
[3716.32 → 3717.20] I think time's up
[3717.20 → 3717.82] with our guest.
[3719.36 → 3719.76] Hey,
[3719.96 → 3720.96] I have a job.
[3721.06 → 3722.12] My job is difficult.
[3723.58 → 3724.22] Reaching stuff
[3724.22 → 3724.82] on the top shelf?
[3727.42 → 3727.82] Wow.
[3730.70 → 3731.14] Oh,
[3731.28 → 3731.72] I didn't hurt
[3731.72 → 3732.58] your feelings today.
[3732.74 → 3733.34] And he goes
[3733.34 → 3734.22] to the live stream doc
[3734.22 → 3735.08] and he searches
[3735.08 → 3735.76] for a new talk.
[3735.78 → 3735.96] Yeah,
[3736.08 → 3737.38] let me pick something
[3737.38 → 3738.32] that Gummy Josh
[3738.32 → 3739.76] doesn't know anything about.
[3740.56 → 3741.22] What do you think
[3741.22 → 3743.72] of Iridium usage
[3743.72 → 3744.42] in,
[3744.42 → 3745.80] um,
[3746.26 → 3747.18] Blastomere Ponies?
[3752.62 → 3753.52] I don't want to talk
[3753.52 → 3753.90] anymore.
[3754.94 → 3755.44] He'll find something.
[3755.44 → 3755.56] Oh,
[3755.66 → 3755.92] oh,
[3755.92 → 3756.18] it's like,
[3756.18 → 3756.96] you got to give it to me.
[3757.02 → 3757.68] If I got Linus
[3757.68 → 3758.38] to be quiet,
[3758.52 → 3760.02] that is like an epic achievement.
[3760.02 → 3760.62] That's actually,
[3760.76 → 3761.70] that is quite impressive.
[3761.74 → 3762.58] We should probably have
[3762.58 → 3763.06] a separate,
[3763.22 → 3763.40] like,
[3763.46 → 3764.56] lower third animation
[3764.56 → 3764.94] that,
[3765.02 → 3765.22] like,
[3765.38 → 3766.28] can put a little crown
[3766.28 → 3766.64] on him
[3766.64 → 3767.04] that's like
[3767.04 → 3767.94] achievement unlocked.
[3768.30 → 3769.44] Do I get a badge?
[3769.44 → 3770.44] Badge on the forum.
[3770.98 → 3771.38] Oh.
[3772.06 → 3773.06] Silenced Linus.
[3773.24 → 3773.94] And it can be like
[3773.94 → 3774.32] one of the
[3774.36 → 3774.52] like,
[3774.58 → 3775.58] the silence icons
[3775.58 → 3776.34] from a video game.
[3776.52 → 3776.70] Like,
[3776.74 → 3777.54] was actually able
[3777.54 → 3778.48] to silence Linus.
[3779.02 → 3780.04] Badge award for him.
[3780.04 → 3780.40] Yeah,
[3780.40 → 3781.22] we're actually going to be
[3781.22 → 3781.84] adding awards
[3781.84 → 3782.42] on our forum.
[3782.52 → 3783.54] Speaking of me not having,
[3783.68 → 3784.26] they're done?
[3784.40 → 3785.44] They're mostly done.
[3785.58 → 3785.76] Oh,
[3785.82 → 3786.14] good work.
[3786.94 → 3787.10] Well,
[3787.10 → 3787.32] it was,
[3787.42 → 3787.72] uh,
[3787.92 → 3788.94] call out to Win Speed.
[3789.12 → 3789.80] I installed it,
[3789.84 → 3790.42] he distributed.
[3790.86 → 3791.16] All right.
[3791.18 → 3792.34] Which was a huge job,
[3792.42 → 3792.80] so thank you,
[3792.84 → 3793.10] Win Speed.
[3793.10 → 3794.58] Speaking of fist bumps,
[3795.12 → 3796.92] EA is,
[3796.96 → 3797.26] uh,
[3797.26 → 3798.46] apparently getting sued
[3798.46 → 3799.70] for shutting down
[3799.70 → 3801.02] the servers for games
[3801.02 → 3801.60] that they're not
[3801.60 → 3802.60] really running anymore.
[3802.96 → 3803.96] So this was posted
[3803.96 → 3804.56] on the forum
[3804.56 → 3805.40] by E. Condo,
[3805.62 → 3806.12] and the article
[3806.12 → 3807.26] is from Tech Dirt,
[3807.66 → 3808.72] and basically,
[3809.42 → 3812.16] what's happening
[3812.16 → 3814.02] is Justin Bassett
[3814.02 → 3815.24] claims he bought
[3815.24 → 3816.28] several sports-themed
[3816.28 → 3817.68] games for Xbox 360
[3817.68 → 3820.04] for about $59.99 each,
[3820.38 → 3820.98] relying on
[3820.98 → 3822.14] Electronic Arts representation
[3822.14 → 3822.84] that the games
[3822.84 → 3823.38] were enabled
[3823.38 → 3825.44] for unlimited online play,
[3825.62 → 3826.24] but the games
[3826.24 → 3826.80] were available
[3826.80 → 3828.62] for only a limited time,
[3828.70 → 3829.16] he says.
[3829.50 → 3830.26] Had the plaintiff
[3830.26 → 3830.98] known at the time
[3830.98 → 3831.64] he would not be able
[3831.64 → 3832.58] to play the products online
[3832.58 → 3833.32] for a certain amount of time,
[3833.36 → 3833.80] he would not have
[3833.80 → 3834.46] purchased the products
[3834.46 → 3835.26] or paid the price
[3835.26 → 3837.84] he paid for the products.
[3839.58 → 3841.40] Whose side are we on here?
[3842.54 → 3844.06] Should they have to run
[3844.06 → 3844.92] servers forever?
[3845.22 → 3846.08] Should they not?
[3846.72 → 3847.76] Unlimited, no.
[3848.28 → 3849.42] Not necessarily unlimited,
[3849.68 → 3850.66] but the amount of time
[3850.66 → 3851.76] that EA does run servers
[3851.76 → 3852.82] is not very expensive.
[3852.84 → 3853.08] acceptable,
[3853.46 → 3854.86] because it's a such
[3854.86 → 3856.08] incredibly short amount
[3856.08 → 3856.48] of time.
[3856.84 → 3857.10] Now,
[3857.44 → 3859.00] this document
[3859.00 → 3860.08] didn't actually state
[3860.08 → 3860.86] anywhere specifically
[3860.86 → 3861.78] on it unless it's
[3861.78 → 3863.52] in the huge 24-page
[3863.52 → 3864.22] something or other
[3864.22 → 3864.96] legal document.
[3865.82 → 3865.96] Yeah.
[3866.02 → 3867.04] One-page legal document,
[3867.04 → 3867.80] it might be somewhere in there,
[3868.00 → 3868.80] exactly how long
[3868.80 → 3869.78] the particular games
[3869.78 → 3870.50] that he's talking about
[3870.50 → 3870.90] lasted,
[3871.16 → 3872.10] but it is very,
[3872.22 → 3872.94] very short period of time.
[3873.00 → 3873.82] What he's asking for,
[3873.88 → 3874.30] I believe,
[3874.38 → 3875.64] is a minimum of three years,
[3875.64 → 3877.50] which is not a lot
[3877.50 → 3878.44] to ask for a game.
[3879.84 → 3883.46] Halo 1 was like quite a
[3883.46 → 3884.02] or Halo 2,
[3884.10 → 3884.24] sorry,
[3884.30 → 3885.12] was quite a while.
[3885.64 → 3885.82] Right.
[3885.98 → 3886.94] Like, quite a long time.
[3887.26 → 3889.50] And NEW was supported
[3889.50 → 3890.66] for 24 years.
[3890.66 → 3892.16] Like, that's too much
[3892.16 → 3893.04] to ask in my opinion.
[3893.28 → 3893.34] Right.
[3893.34 → 3893.76] You shouldn't ask
[3893.76 → 3894.74] for 24 years,
[3894.84 → 3895.86] but you should also
[3895.86 → 3896.46] be able to ask
[3896.46 → 3897.00] for more than
[3897.00 → 3897.82] one or two years.
[3898.18 → 3899.00] And I think what
[3899.00 → 3900.00] they were also asking
[3900.00 → 3901.54] is that EA
[3901.54 → 3902.74] should disclose
[3902.74 → 3904.40] what the window is.
[3904.50 → 3905.48] You can't say unlimited
[3905.48 → 3906.26] if it's going to be
[3906.26 → 3906.88] a year or two.
[3906.88 → 3908.58] Josh, what do you think
[3908.58 → 3909.44] the solution is here?
[3910.48 → 3911.62] Yeah, good question, right?
[3911.66 → 3912.16] I mean, I do see
[3912.16 → 3912.92] both sides of it.
[3913.00 → 3913.28] Like, you know,
[3913.32 → 3914.48] indefinite support
[3914.48 → 3915.72] is not something
[3915.72 → 3916.72] that you can ask for.
[3916.82 → 3917.26] But then, yeah,
[3917.26 → 3918.30] getting shortchanged,
[3918.40 → 3919.54] like, well, you know,
[3919.56 → 3920.88] you bought that last Tuesday
[3920.88 → 3922.50] and it didn't sell
[3922.50 → 3923.68] the way we thought it would.
[3924.32 → 3925.24] And we want to reallocate
[3925.24 → 3926.34] that team so you have
[3926.34 → 3927.00] until next Thursday
[3927.00 → 3927.76] to play your game.
[3928.18 → 3928.46] Yeah.
[3928.72 → 3928.92] Yeah.
[3929.46 → 3929.98] I don't know.
[3930.00 → 3930.52] I mean, I don't know
[3930.52 → 3931.24] what the answer is.
[3931.36 → 3932.12] But yeah, I think like
[3932.12 → 3932.80] three years,
[3932.88 → 3933.34] something like that,
[3933.38 → 3934.26] I think that's feasible.
[3934.56 → 3935.20] I mean, if you look
[3935.20 → 3935.72] at the investment
[3935.72 → 3936.48] that you put into it,
[3936.48 → 3937.72] like, what do you expect
[3937.72 → 3939.34] the life cycle of a game to be?
[3939.40 → 3940.66] Especially with a sports game
[3940.66 → 3941.66] where, you know,
[3941.74 → 3943.64] I guess replay is a lot higher.
[3944.10 → 3945.12] You know, you're not looking at like...
[3945.12 → 3946.12] Replay's incredibly high.
[3946.46 → 3946.68] Yeah.
[3947.26 → 3948.46] So it's one of those things
[3948.46 → 3949.02] where it's not like,
[3949.14 → 3950.20] oh, I beat the storyline
[3950.20 → 3952.20] or I'm tired of going out
[3952.20 → 3953.06] and just, you know,
[3953.60 → 3954.94] doing raids or whatever else.
[3955.28 → 3955.86] I don't know.
[3955.94 → 3958.18] I mean, I can rest assured
[3958.18 → 3958.96] whatever EA does,
[3959.06 → 3959.78] you guys won't like it.
[3960.52 → 3961.28] You know what?
[3961.34 → 3962.36] I think the solution
[3962.36 → 3963.90] that I would be happy with
[3963.90 → 3966.00] is EA running
[3966.00 → 3966.96] their own servers
[3966.96 → 3969.70] for however long they want.
[3969.86 → 3971.16] And then allowing other people
[3971.16 → 3972.14] to do so afterwards.
[3972.26 → 3974.04] And allowing third-party servers
[3974.04 → 3974.64] to be hosted
[3974.64 → 3975.60] because that's the thing
[3975.60 → 3976.38] that kills me about it.
[3976.42 → 3977.76] We've got a lot of the Twitch chat
[3977.76 → 3978.48] going like,
[3978.92 → 3979.96] Counter-Strike's still running,
[3980.10 → 3981.30] Battlefield Bad Company 2
[3981.30 → 3981.98] still running,
[3982.34 → 3983.22] Quake's still running,
[3983.32 → 3984.54] all this stuff's still running.
[3984.64 → 3985.52] And it's like, well, yeah,
[3985.82 → 3987.20] because the community
[3987.20 → 3989.40] is allowed to keep it running.
[3989.62 → 3990.46] That's the problem
[3990.46 → 3992.08] with EA's closed platform
[3992.08 → 3993.62] when it comes to server hosting
[3993.62 → 3995.58] is that the game runs
[3995.58 → 3996.86] for as long as they kind of
[3996.86 → 3998.14] sit there and go like,
[3998.44 → 3998.64] yep.
[3999.16 → 4000.26] And this time,
[4000.32 → 4001.70] it's not just an EA problem.
[4002.04 → 4003.50] Just this EA getting sued
[4003.50 → 4005.04] so it got into our dock.
[4005.10 → 4006.10] Well, that EA is one
[4006.10 → 4007.02] of the worst offenders
[4007.02 → 4008.86] because they're doing yearly releases
[4008.86 → 4009.56] on their titles.
[4009.72 → 4009.94] I mean,
[4010.06 → 4011.82] if Blizzard had released,
[4011.92 → 4012.48] you know,
[4012.54 → 4014.46] 16 Star Crafts by now,
[4014.66 → 4015.54] I'm willing to bet
[4015.54 → 4016.78] Star Craft 1 support
[4016.78 → 4017.70] would have fallen away
[4017.70 → 4018.34] at some point.
[4018.34 → 4020.36] whereas Blizzard releases
[4020.36 → 4021.34] so few titles,
[4021.50 → 4022.36] the overhead is,
[4022.58 → 4023.38] especially because
[4023.38 → 4024.98] a lot of their older library
[4024.98 → 4026.32] is old-ass games
[4026.32 → 4026.98] where the overhead
[4026.98 → 4027.74] is much lower.
[4028.02 → 4029.48] So there's all of that.
[4030.04 → 4032.26] But EA backs themselves
[4032.26 → 4033.06] into this corner
[4033.06 → 4033.92] where realistically,
[4034.30 → 4035.68] if they were fully supporting
[4035.68 → 4037.66] with a Battle. Net-like infrastructure
[4037.66 → 4039.56] every single sports game
[4039.56 → 4040.34] they've ever made
[4040.34 → 4042.56] for a period of like 10 years,
[4043.72 → 4045.82] would it really take that much though?
[4045.82 → 4048.58] It wouldn't take that much
[4048.58 → 4049.34] because even things
[4049.34 → 4050.42] like security patches,
[4050.60 → 4052.10] you'd have to have teams
[4052.10 → 4052.88] working on them.
[4053.42 → 4054.00] That's a good point.
[4054.22 → 4055.14] The security patches point
[4055.14 → 4055.60] is very good,
[4055.70 → 4056.80] but hosting the infrastructure,
[4057.00 → 4058.28] it's not going to take that much.
[4058.28 → 4058.48] Okay,
[4058.58 → 4059.44] that I don't think
[4059.44 → 4059.96] is the problem.
[4060.04 → 4061.18] The problem is the overhead.
[4061.48 → 4061.64] Yeah,
[4061.82 → 4062.04] yeah.
[4062.46 → 4063.54] People working on it,
[4063.56 → 4064.04] stuff like that.
[4064.26 → 4064.72] And that's interesting.
[4064.84 → 4065.18] And yes,
[4065.24 → 4065.88] I understand.
[4066.02 → 4066.64] And like I said,
[4066.72 → 4068.42] EA is not at all
[4068.42 → 4069.40] the only company
[4069.40 → 4070.42] that has done this
[4070.42 → 4071.80] and had problems with it.
[4071.94 → 4072.08] Yeah.
[4072.14 → 4072.88] But it's just,
[4073.28 → 4073.72] obviously,
[4073.88 → 4074.52] they're a huge company.
[4074.60 → 4075.16] They're going to come up
[4075.16 → 4075.56] in our dock.
[4075.56 → 4076.14] But,
[4076.50 → 4076.96] yeah.
[4077.12 → 4077.68] Every week.
[4077.82 → 4078.28] Every week.
[4079.12 → 4079.90] In other news,
[4080.44 → 4081.32] EA actually did something
[4081.32 → 4081.92] perfect.
[4082.42 → 4082.78] Yeah,
[4082.80 → 4083.62] I'll bring this one up.
[4084.54 → 4085.02] But,
[4085.60 → 4087.06] a little bit perfect.
[4087.72 → 4088.80] It's down a little bit
[4088.80 → 4089.38] from the other one.
[4089.92 → 4090.54] It's still a good
[4090.54 → 4091.18] community topics.
[4091.44 → 4092.30] I hate to bail,
[4092.42 → 4093.16] but I got to roll.
[4093.74 → 4094.18] All right,
[4094.28 → 4095.40] thank you for joining us,
[4095.48 → 4095.82] Josh.
[4095.86 → 4097.46] You've been a fantastic guest.
[4097.86 → 4098.26] Guys,
[4098.36 → 4100.92] let us know in the Twitch chat.
[4100.92 → 4102.08] I'm actually going to start
[4102.08 → 4103.04] asking Twitch chat
[4103.04 → 4104.36] to rate all of our guests
[4104.36 → 4105.70] on a scale of one to five.
[4105.80 → 4105.82] Of course,
[4105.82 → 4106.82] you start with Josh.
[4106.90 → 4107.64] I'm starting with Josh.
[4107.64 → 4107.96] Yeah,
[4108.04 → 4108.34] exactly.
[4109.02 → 4109.54] He's a model.
[4109.66 → 4109.88] Of course,
[4109.94 → 4110.70] he's going to get highly rated.
[4111.34 → 4112.46] Models do not always
[4112.46 → 4113.36] get highly rated
[4113.36 → 4115.08] when they are like,
[4115.14 → 4115.56] you know,
[4115.64 → 4116.60] sex toy models
[4116.60 → 4118.34] because those pictures
[4118.34 → 4118.86] are gross,
[4118.96 → 4119.16] dude.
[4119.66 → 4120.02] What?
[4121.26 → 4121.94] You didn't know
[4121.94 → 4122.60] what kind of modelling
[4122.60 → 4123.26] Josh does.
[4124.86 → 4125.14] Yeah,
[4125.20 → 4126.22] definitely neither did I,
[4126.32 → 4126.70] but you know,
[4126.76 → 4127.88] I'm glad I found out.
[4127.88 → 4130.30] Just because you're good
[4130.30 → 4130.78] with Photoshop,
[4131.02 → 4131.86] I don't know what posters
[4131.86 → 4132.56] you got on your wall,
[4132.66 → 4134.08] but you know,
[4134.10 → 4134.52] I tell you what,
[4134.54 → 4136.34] the next time that I do
[4136.34 → 4136.98] the live stream,
[4137.04 → 4137.96] because I will be back
[4137.96 → 4139.42] in person,
[4139.42 → 4141.26] and then I can turn around
[4141.26 → 4142.14] and look at your,
[4142.24 → 4142.98] I guess,
[4143.84 → 4145.76] homage to Tech Syndicate
[4145.76 → 4146.72] behind you there on the wall.
[4147.08 → 4147.32] Hey,
[4147.40 → 4149.36] it is always right outside
[4149.36 → 4150.52] the frame at all times.
[4150.62 → 4151.42] You know how Logan's
[4151.42 → 4152.26] always joking about
[4152.26 → 4153.06] he could potentially
[4153.06 → 4154.14] not be wearing pants?
[4154.32 → 4155.50] I could potentially
[4155.50 → 4157.08] have lewd photos
[4157.08 → 4158.46] of you,
[4158.74 → 4159.18] Logan,
[4159.42 → 4159.84] Slick,
[4160.00 → 4161.14] and every other
[4161.14 → 4162.02] industry affiliate
[4162.02 → 4163.26] that I've ever talked to
[4163.26 → 4165.08] just out of frame.
[4166.02 → 4166.68] Right here.
[4166.74 → 4167.08] What do you mean?
[4167.08 → 4168.08] Right here, guys,
[4168.20 → 4169.66] and I could potentially
[4169.66 → 4170.72] not be wearing pants.
[4171.10 → 4171.72] Peace, Josh.
[4171.80 → 4172.76] Thanks for joining us,
[4172.76 → 4174.22] and we'll see you again soon.
[4174.56 → 4175.04] Sounds cool.
[4175.10 → 4175.66] I'll see you guys later.
[4175.72 → 4176.12] Thanks for having me.
[4176.12 → 4176.72] See you later, Josh.
[4176.92 → 4177.40] All right.
[4178.82 → 4179.22] So,
[4179.36 → 4180.20] why don't we move on
[4180.20 → 4180.98] to our next topic,
[4181.14 → 4181.90] which is that EA
[4181.90 → 4183.16] sucks a little bit less.
[4183.64 → 4184.08] A little,
[4184.12 → 4185.38] a little bit less.
[4185.38 → 4186.20] I don't give them
[4186.20 → 4187.28] that much credit for this.
[4187.36 → 4188.26] No, neither do I.
[4188.32 → 4188.94] That's why I keep on
[4188.94 → 4189.66] saying a little bit.
[4189.82 → 4190.36] Where is it?
[4190.38 → 4190.82] Ah, yes.
[4190.86 → 4192.00] Okay, I couldn't find it
[4192.00 → 4192.98] because it was hiding.
[4193.58 → 4195.42] The title of the article
[4195.42 → 4196.92] was EA did something good,
[4197.38 → 4198.20] which was,
[4198.62 → 4199.66] I wasn't looking for that
[4199.66 → 4200.18] even so.
[4200.44 → 4201.14] So, EA,
[4201.32 → 4202.04] this was posted on
[4202.04 → 4202.94] the Linus Tech Tips forum
[4202.94 → 4203.88] by user Lightning.
[4204.04 → 4205.26] Thank you very much for that.
[4206.06 → 4208.12] EA raises $18,000
[4208.12 → 4209.78] for AIDS research.
[4210.06 → 4211.34] More than 80 staffers
[4211.34 → 4212.26] took part in the event,
[4212.36 → 4213.30] which is a 10-kilometer
[4213.30 → 4214.46] fundraising talkathon.
[4214.46 → 4215.04] The money will go
[4215.04 → 4215.80] to the San Francisco
[4215.80 → 4216.56] AIDS Foundation
[4216.56 → 4217.64] and 50 other AIDS service
[4217.64 → 4218.50] organizations throughout
[4218.50 → 4219.12] the Bay Area.
[4219.80 → 4220.84] It is important to be involved,
[4221.00 → 4222.14] et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[4223.18 → 4225.68] And, yeah.
[4225.86 → 4228.66] They match the employees'
[4228.92 → 4229.76] contributions.
[4230.48 → 4230.82] Okay.
[4230.88 → 4231.42] That's what they do.
[4231.46 → 4232.18] So they match the employees'
[4232.32 → 4232.72] contributions,
[4233.42 → 4236.22] which totalled $18,000.
[4236.70 → 4237.60] But you're EA.
[4239.06 → 4239.50] Yeah.
[4239.50 → 4240.62] I mean, to me,
[4240.72 → 4241.78] this is kind of like,
[4241.86 → 4242.50] you know...
[4242.50 → 4242.98] I can't...
[4242.98 → 4243.22] Sorry.
[4243.38 → 4244.38] I can't possibly say
[4244.38 → 4245.50] it's bad.
[4245.64 → 4245.86] No.
[4246.04 → 4246.50] It's good.
[4246.66 → 4247.44] It's not a bad thing,
[4247.52 → 4247.98] but it's like,
[4248.70 → 4250.04] this doesn't make up for...
[4250.04 → 4250.44] If...
[4250.44 → 4251.14] I don't know.
[4251.26 → 4252.46] Maybe this is a yearly thing.
[4252.72 → 4253.00] Whatever.
[4253.34 → 4254.02] Maybe this has just been
[4254.02 → 4254.56] going on forever.
[4254.68 → 4255.96] But if this was an attempt
[4255.96 → 4256.44] to, like,
[4256.52 → 4257.68] buy back some of the hate,
[4257.84 → 4258.44] like, dude,
[4258.58 → 4259.86] you're really far off.
[4259.88 → 4260.48] You should have made
[4260.48 → 4261.12] a bigger splash.
[4261.22 → 4261.44] Yeah.
[4261.52 → 4262.74] I mean, it's kind of like...
[4262.74 → 4264.12] It just seems kind of hollow.
[4264.48 → 4265.32] Like, you know when
[4265.32 → 4266.62] a celebrity
[4266.62 → 4267.74] gets diagnosed
[4267.74 → 4268.90] with some disease?
[4269.04 → 4269.50] And then they donate
[4269.50 → 4270.08] millions of dollars
[4270.08 → 4270.76] to the foundation
[4270.76 → 4271.58] that's trying to cure the disease.
[4271.58 → 4271.82] Yeah.
[4272.06 → 4273.08] And then when it's something
[4273.08 → 4274.68] that doesn't affect them personally,
[4274.96 → 4275.84] it's just like,
[4275.88 → 4276.78] they tweet about it
[4276.78 → 4277.12] or whatever.
[4277.70 → 4278.46] That, to me,
[4278.50 → 4279.88] is what this kind of feels like,
[4279.98 → 4280.74] where it's like,
[4280.82 → 4282.64] yeah, you could have done more,
[4282.78 → 4283.76] but I don't want to criticize
[4283.76 → 4285.28] because the reality of it is
[4285.28 → 4286.76] you did give thousands of dollars to you.
[4286.76 → 4287.50] It's still a very good thing.
[4287.86 → 4288.76] So I'm happy
[4288.76 → 4289.70] that EA did this.
[4290.04 → 4291.54] And if it's a yearly thing,
[4291.68 → 4292.30] then it's just probably
[4292.30 → 4293.48] something that's been going on forever
[4293.48 → 4294.46] and it's not a huge deal.
[4294.50 → 4295.32] It's just a part of the company.
[4295.58 → 4296.48] That's very cool.
[4296.66 → 4297.62] If this was an attempt
[4297.62 → 4298.18] to, like,
[4298.32 → 4299.52] make people like them more,
[4299.64 → 4300.32] then, dude,
[4301.36 → 4302.44] you missed the mark
[4302.44 → 4303.10] by quite a bit.
[4303.44 → 4303.56] Yeah.
[4303.56 → 4305.02] So I would like to know
[4305.02 → 4305.76] more about the story,
[4305.88 → 4307.08] but good job, EA.
[4307.30 → 4308.14] Thank you for donating
[4308.14 → 4309.92] to Raids Research.
[4310.42 → 4311.22] Raids Research.
[4311.60 → 4312.34] No, I think you're thinking
[4312.34 → 4312.78] of Blizzard.
[4314.90 → 4315.30] Yes.
[4315.84 → 4317.00] I meant to say
[4317.00 → 4317.72] AIDS Research.
[4318.06 → 4319.00] We're on fire today.
[4319.16 → 4319.96] We are on fire today.
[4320.00 → 4320.24] All right,
[4320.28 → 4320.80] let's talk about
[4320.80 → 4321.92] the lab-grown burger
[4321.92 → 4323.20] because I totally
[4323.20 → 4324.30] think this is awesome.
[4324.70 → 4326.00] So this actually
[4326.00 → 4327.84] is sort of in line
[4327.84 → 4328.92] with the conversation
[4328.92 → 4329.94] that we were having
[4329.94 → 4331.08] about building
[4331.08 → 4331.78] an all-in-one.
[4332.24 → 4333.70] That's like a boutique-grade
[4333.70 → 4334.82] all-in-one computer.
[4335.10 → 4336.28] When you only build
[4336.28 → 4337.06] a couple of them,
[4337.26 → 4337.84] something that is
[4337.84 → 4339.00] by definition boutique,
[4339.20 → 4340.36] it is extremely expensive.
[4340.74 → 4341.74] So this is an article
[4341.74 → 4343.00] from Digital Trends.
[4343.66 → 4344.14] Unsurprisingly,
[4344.38 → 4345.24] says the headline,
[4345.58 → 4348.10] the $300,000
[4348.10 → 4349.68] lab-grown burger.
[4349.68 → 4351.12] So this was made
[4351.12 → 4354.18] using 3D printing technology
[4354.18 → 4357.66] as well as simulated meat
[4357.66 → 4359.18] that was grown
[4359.18 → 4360.40] as opposed to...
[4360.40 → 4360.86] Actually, hold on.
[4360.90 → 4361.10] No, no.
[4361.14 → 4362.36] This one does use 3D printing
[4362.36 → 4362.76] or doesn't?
[4362.80 → 4363.52] I know there's something else.
[4363.96 → 4364.88] So blah, blah, blah.
[4364.92 → 4365.68] Yeah, 3D printed
[4365.68 → 4366.40] lab-grown burger
[4366.40 → 4370.04] to build what should be
[4370.04 → 4370.88] nutritionally
[4370.88 → 4372.04] and in theory,
[4372.24 → 4372.86] taste-wise,
[4373.36 → 4374.22] beef.
[4374.22 → 4375.02] Yeah.
[4375.24 → 4377.86] So it cost $331,200
[4377.86 → 4378.70] to produce.
[4379.22 → 4380.18] No one liked it
[4380.18 → 4382.42] and it's kind of insane.
[4382.56 → 4382.92] But it works.
[4382.92 → 4383.50] So here are the tweets
[4383.50 → 4386.04] from the BBC correspondent.
[4387.04 → 4388.00] Any says
[4388.00 → 4389.78] she expected texture
[4389.78 → 4390.64] to be softer.
[4390.90 → 4391.62] It's close to meat
[4391.62 → 4392.28] but not juicy.
[4392.86 → 4393.82] There's no fat
[4393.82 → 4394.30] in the burger
[4394.30 → 4395.30] so tasters say
[4395.30 → 4396.28] not the right flavour.
[4396.72 → 4397.54] Both tasters
[4397.54 → 4398.28] want ketchup.
[4398.28 → 4401.22] The lack of fat marbles
[4401.22 → 4402.14] means that the lack
[4402.14 → 4402.84] of savoury,
[4403.22 → 4404.24] overindulgent finish
[4404.24 → 4405.36] that we've come to enjoy
[4405.36 → 4406.32] that's a direct quote,
[4406.52 → 4407.30] almost direct quote
[4407.30 → 4408.24] from the article
[4408.24 → 4410.00] is not there.
[4410.12 → 4411.08] We like fat.
[4411.26 → 4412.10] We like juice
[4412.10 → 4412.66] and it's not in it.
[4412.66 → 4413.60] Fat and salt
[4413.60 → 4415.32] and all those good things.
[4415.46 → 4416.22] And this is a
[4416.22 → 4417.28] health-focused
[4417.28 → 4418.40] 3D printed burger.
[4418.64 → 4418.98] Yeah.
[4420.08 → 4421.48] I'm sure if they see...
[4421.48 → 4422.02] Another thing is
[4422.02 → 4422.96] if you look at the picture
[4422.96 → 4425.10] there's bun,
[4425.38 → 4425.78] patty,
[4425.92 → 4426.26] tomato,
[4426.42 → 4426.66] lettuce.
[4426.66 → 4428.12] Yeah,
[4428.16 → 4428.70] they probably could have
[4428.70 → 4429.48] dressed it up a little more.
[4429.52 → 4430.60] They could have dressed it up.
[4430.60 → 4431.76] They could have put
[4431.76 → 4432.52] ketchup on it.
[4432.76 → 4433.88] This is kind of a fun article.
[4434.04 → 4434.90] I don't know if you read this
[4434.90 → 4435.58] but they've got
[4435.58 → 4437.50] other ridiculously expensive foods
[4437.50 → 4438.72] that you could have bought instead.
[4439.14 → 4441.74] So 331 golden opulent sundaes
[4441.74 → 4442.66] which is like
[4442.66 → 4443.72] expensive chocolates,
[4443.86 → 4444.92] gold-covered almonds,
[4445.20 → 4445.76] chocolate truffled,
[4445.88 → 4446.36] candies, fruits
[4446.36 → 4446.84] and topped
[4446.84 → 4448.14] with a 23-carat
[4448.14 → 4449.26] edible gold leaf.
[4449.64 → 4450.08] You can get
[4450.08 → 4451.32] diamond-encrusted sushi.
[4451.54 → 4451.92] You could get
[4451.92 → 4454.12] 331,200
[4454.12 → 4455.52] McDonald's cheeseburgers
[4455.52 → 4458.10] which would kill you.
[4458.98 → 4459.02] Yeah.
[4459.92 → 4460.60] I mean,
[4460.78 → 4461.18] yeah,
[4461.52 → 4462.22] whatever.
[4462.76 → 4463.42] All right,
[4463.54 → 4464.88] moving on to our next thing.
[4465.20 → 4466.26] John Carmack joins
[4466.26 → 4468.08] Oculus as the CTO.
[4468.56 → 4469.22] So we were talking
[4469.22 → 4469.94] last week,
[4470.02 → 4470.46] I think,
[4470.54 → 4471.34] about how NVIDIA
[4471.34 → 4472.14] is making their own
[4472.14 → 4473.18] virtual reality headset
[4473.18 → 4475.28] and some thoughts came up...
[4475.28 → 4475.92] Well, that wasn't like
[4475.92 → 4476.86] a weird prototype thing.
[4476.86 → 4477.90] Weird prototype thing
[4477.90 → 4478.60] and all that kind of stuff
[4478.60 → 4479.94] but some interesting thoughts
[4479.94 → 4480.44] came up with people
[4480.44 → 4480.96] talking about
[4480.96 → 4483.10] maybe more mature companies
[4483.10 → 4484.04] were going to step in
[4484.04 → 4485.48] and just blow up the field.
[4485.78 → 4486.68] I saw a lot of comments
[4486.68 → 4487.54] about this in different places
[4487.54 → 4488.98] and people were worried
[4488.98 → 4490.34] that Oculus might get run over.
[4490.72 → 4491.38] Oculus would pioneer
[4491.38 → 4492.06] the whole thing
[4492.06 → 4492.46] and then just get
[4492.46 → 4493.24] completely run over.
[4493.74 → 4495.28] John Carmack steps in.
[4495.68 → 4496.46] Everything changes.
[4497.52 → 4498.38] Oculus Rift is now
[4498.38 → 4499.22] that mature company.
[4499.70 → 4499.80] Right.
[4499.80 → 4500.96] It doesn't matter anymore.
[4501.10 → 4502.34] The credibility is there.
[4502.44 → 4503.04] Just boom.
[4503.04 → 4503.28] I mean,
[4503.36 → 4503.52] like,
[4503.60 → 4503.86] okay,
[4504.34 → 4505.70] when you build
[4505.70 → 4507.00] the prototype that works,
[4507.22 → 4508.62] your credibility goes like this.
[4508.66 → 4508.88] Oh, yeah.
[4508.88 → 4510.84] When Valve is all like
[4510.84 → 4512.14] got their parties all wet
[4512.14 → 4512.98] about what you're doing,
[4513.14 → 4514.60] your credibility goes like this.
[4514.98 → 4516.66] John Carmack is one of those guys
[4516.66 → 4518.18] that could actually sit
[4518.18 → 4519.36] at a round table
[4519.36 → 4520.86] with someone like Gabe Newell
[4520.86 → 4521.80] and talk shop.
[4522.04 → 4523.84] So when he legit
[4523.84 → 4525.50] joins your company
[4525.50 → 4527.28] as the CTO,
[4527.66 → 4528.42] then your credibility
[4528.42 → 4529.28] goes like this.
[4529.28 → 4529.96] You get one of those
[4529.96 → 4531.74] big iterations of credibility
[4531.74 → 4532.62] that he's just talking about.
[4532.66 → 4533.68] It's just huge.
[4533.84 → 4534.68] So good for them.
[4534.96 → 4535.74] What's great about him
[4535.74 → 4536.90] is he's one of those guys
[4536.90 → 4537.38] that,
[4537.74 → 4538.22] again,
[4538.34 → 4539.08] this is the credibility
[4539.08 → 4539.76] conversation
[4539.76 → 4540.72] where it goes beyond
[4540.72 → 4541.76] his technical skill
[4541.76 → 4543.84] because a lot of
[4543.84 → 4545.66] truly visionary guys,
[4545.76 → 4545.90] I mean,
[4545.94 → 4546.96] I think Steve Wozniak
[4546.96 → 4547.66] is a great example
[4547.66 → 4548.60] which will help segue
[4548.60 → 4549.66] into our next topic
[4549.66 → 4551.66] where they're visionaries
[4552.32 → 4553.44] and they're geniuses
[4553.44 → 4554.08] and they're brilliant
[4554.08 → 4554.48] but,
[4554.62 → 4554.92] I mean,
[4554.96 → 4555.60] you put them in front
[4555.60 → 4556.16] of a camera
[4556.16 → 4557.06] or you try to,
[4557.06 → 4557.22] like,
[4557.28 → 4557.76] talk to them
[4557.76 → 4558.56] and you're kind of like,
[4558.76 → 4560.64] they can be,
[4560.76 → 4560.96] I mean,
[4561.02 → 4562.04] and Won is a lot better
[4562.04 → 4563.10] particularly these days.
[4563.10 → 4563.32] Oh, yeah.
[4563.52 → 4563.92] I mean,
[4564.06 → 4564.84] his Big Bang Theory
[4564.84 → 4565.68] appearance was awesome.
[4565.80 → 4566.34] Yeah, yeah.
[4566.34 → 4566.78] But,
[4566.78 → 4569.36] having someone
[4569.36 → 4570.34] who's as eloquent
[4570.34 → 4571.56] as John Carmack,
[4571.72 → 4572.92] he's a great interviewee.
[4573.36 → 4574.20] He's fantastic.
[4574.44 → 4575.24] Carmack's amazing.
[4575.40 → 4575.90] Yeah, anyway.
[4575.90 → 4576.54] He's so good.
[4576.70 → 4576.94] I mean,
[4576.94 → 4577.96] we could just sort of,
[4578.02 → 4578.32] like,
[4579.04 → 4579.38] you know,
[4580.40 → 4581.68] wank off John Carmack
[4581.68 → 4582.60] for the rest of this show,
[4582.64 → 4583.00] I think,
[4583.32 → 4585.72] and both of us
[4585.72 → 4586.38] would enjoy it.
[4586.40 → 4587.24] I don't know that he would.
[4587.42 → 4587.60] John,
[4587.64 → 4588.18] if you're watching,
[4588.28 → 4589.20] I'm sorry for saying that.
[4589.24 → 4590.08] That was totally inappropriate
[4590.08 → 4590.86] but you're awesome
[4590.86 → 4591.88] and, uh...
[4591.88 → 4592.36] We're very excited
[4592.36 → 4593.30] that he's now
[4593.30 → 4594.80] the CTO of Oculus Rift
[4594.80 → 4595.88] because I'm super stoked
[4595.88 → 4596.24] to get it,
[4596.32 → 4597.16] everyone else is super stoked
[4597.16 → 4597.60] to get it
[4597.60 → 4598.90] and this just makes me
[4598.90 → 4599.60] much more confident.
[4599.76 → 4600.08] I mean,
[4600.18 → 4601.46] future of gaming, guys.
[4601.72 → 4602.48] Future of gaming.
[4602.54 → 4602.86] Seriously.
[4603.22 → 4603.78] That's, uh,
[4603.78 → 4604.66] extremely exciting.
[4604.80 → 4605.42] Speaking of which,
[4605.48 → 4606.16] I wanted to bring up
[4606.16 → 4607.18] something that I didn't have
[4607.18 → 4608.24] a chance to talk about
[4608.24 → 4608.72] last week.
[4608.80 → 4609.58] Oh, I said I was gonna
[4609.58 → 4610.94] segue into, uh,
[4611.38 → 4612.38] into the, uh,
[4612.40 → 4613.10] the Jobs movie.
[4613.58 → 4614.66] Is this better than that?
[4614.86 → 4616.04] I think maybe.
[4616.16 → 4616.88] Okay, let's do it.
[4616.96 → 4617.14] Do it.
[4617.14 → 4617.64] Um, are,
[4617.76 → 4619.32] are old things
[4619.32 → 4620.48] that people tried to make
[4620.48 → 4622.58] and fail that brutally
[4622.58 → 4624.04] now becoming things
[4624.04 → 4624.94] that make tons of sense
[4624.94 → 4625.28] and everyone's
[4625.28 → 4625.86] super excited about?
[4626.06 → 4627.32] Like the Power Glove
[4627.32 → 4628.26] turning into Peregrine.
[4628.92 → 4629.58] Virtual Boy
[4629.58 → 4630.60] turning into Oculus Rift.
[4630.62 → 4631.82] I never replied
[4631.82 → 4633.24] to an email from Peregrine.
[4633.66 → 4634.60] You probably should.
[4634.64 → 4635.00] Crap.
[4635.10 → 4635.48] They were gonna,
[4635.62 → 4635.84] no,
[4635.90 → 4636.96] because I reached out to them
[4636.96 → 4638.02] about getting a sample
[4638.02 → 4638.76] so that we could,
[4638.80 → 4638.98] uh,
[4638.98 → 4639.58] so we could check it out
[4639.58 → 4640.30] and showcase it.
[4640.42 → 4641.40] I'm going to email you
[4641.40 → 4642.04] right now
[4642.04 → 4642.84] so that you remember
[4642.84 → 4643.66] to do that later.
[4643.66 → 4643.82] Yeah, shoot,
[4643.94 → 4644.78] because I think he said,
[4644.82 → 4645.70] he said no initially
[4645.70 → 4646.84] because they didn't have any,
[4646.94 → 4647.86] they didn't have any budget
[4647.86 → 4648.92] for it or something like that,
[4648.98 → 4649.96] but then I think he reached
[4649.96 → 4650.68] out to me again.
[4651.02 → 4651.94] So for those of you guys
[4651.94 → 4653.06] who haven't heard of it,
[4653.40 → 4654.66] the Peregrine Glove
[4654.66 → 4655.82] is,
[4655.88 → 4656.98] I'm just going to load it up here,
[4657.06 → 4657.98] the Peregrine Home.
[4658.14 → 4658.64] Let's go ahead
[4658.64 → 4659.40] and fire this up.
[4659.66 → 4660.28] All right, so there.
[4660.60 → 4661.56] Talk about Power Glove
[4661.56 → 4662.28] versus Peregrine.
[4662.68 → 4664.18] So Power Glove is,
[4664.72 → 4665.84] they're actually very different,
[4665.96 → 4667.04] but the idea of having
[4667.04 → 4667.68] a controller
[4668.02 → 4668.72] adapt to your hand
[4668.72 → 4670.32] and or arm in some way
[4670.32 → 4672.02] is still inherent in Peregrine.
[4672.10 → 4672.62] So what you do
[4672.62 → 4673.90] is you have your controlling thumb
[4673.90 → 4675.56] and you touch different points
[4675.56 → 4676.40] on your fingers
[4676.40 → 4677.88] to the contacts on your,
[4678.10 → 4678.54] um,
[4678.70 → 4679.22] on your thumb.
[4679.28 → 4679.96] So there are contacts
[4679.96 → 4681.36] along each one of your fingers
[4681.36 → 4682.58] and you touch it to your thumb
[4682.58 → 4683.58] and then those are bound
[4683.58 → 4684.70] to buttons on your keyboard
[4684.70 → 4685.64] so you can essentially
[4685.64 → 4686.32] play games
[4686.32 → 4687.40] with just your hand,
[4687.92 → 4689.14] which is interesting,
[4689.46 → 4690.44] enables different,
[4690.80 → 4691.02] uh,
[4691.02 → 4692.04] my favourite thing about it
[4692.04 → 4692.50] is if you have
[4692.50 → 4693.90] special disabilities,
[4694.04 → 4694.68] it can help you
[4694.68 → 4695.72] a lot.
[4695.94 → 4696.74] Now you tried it
[4696.74 → 4697.52] and you didn't like it
[4697.52 → 4698.26] that much initially.
[4698.38 → 4698.88] I tried it,
[4698.90 → 4699.44] I didn't like it
[4699.44 → 4700.08] that much initially
[4700.08 → 4701.26] because what I was
[4701.26 → 4702.48] trying to do was,
[4702.60 → 4703.54] and one of the problems
[4703.54 → 4704.62] is certain pieces
[4704.62 → 4705.16] of hardware
[4705.16 → 4706.28] will not demo well.
[4707.06 → 4707.86] You have to use it
[4707.86 → 4708.62] for a while
[4708.62 → 4710.22] to actually get used to it.
[4710.26 → 4711.08] So I sit down,
[4711.16 → 4711.90] try and play Data
[4711.90 → 4712.58] with this thing,
[4712.84 → 4713.50] and I'm trying to
[4713.50 → 4714.86] quickly press all the buttons
[4714.86 → 4716.84] by tapping my fingers together
[4716.84 → 4718.02] and it just felt weird
[4718.02 → 4719.88] because my natural
[4719.88 → 4721.00] muscle memory
[4721.00 → 4721.96] is not to tap
[4721.96 → 4722.74] my fingers together
[4722.74 → 4723.10] when I,
[4723.14 → 4723.86] when I want to press,
[4723.86 → 4724.54] uh,
[4724.72 → 4725.18] EWER.
[4726.04 → 4726.36] Right.
[4726.40 → 4726.92] I'm not tapping
[4726.92 → 4727.42] my fingers together.
[4727.52 → 4728.02] So I'd run up
[4728.02 → 4728.78] to someone to fight
[4728.78 → 4729.68] and then instinctively
[4729.68 → 4730.32] my hand would like
[4730.32 → 4730.90] go down
[4730.90 → 4731.80] to try and like
[4731.80 → 4732.90] tap on the keyboard
[4732.90 → 4733.40] and then it'd be like,
[4733.46 → 4733.78] no, wait,
[4733.84 → 4734.44] I have to press
[4734.44 → 4734.94] and then I'd have to
[4734.94 → 4735.48] remember like
[4735.48 → 4736.28] which one was which
[4736.28 → 4736.50] and it,
[4736.60 → 4737.72] it wasn't Twitch
[4737.72 → 4739.12] and it wasn't instinctive.
[4739.34 → 4740.40] But if you play
[4740.40 → 4741.30] with it for a while,
[4741.38 → 4742.14] it could be Twitch
[4742.14 → 4743.18] and instinctive.
[4743.30 → 4744.22] So I would be interested
[4744.22 → 4744.94] to play with it
[4744.94 → 4745.90] for like a day
[4745.90 → 4747.04] instead of a five minute
[4747.04 → 4747.74] demo that I got
[4747.74 → 4748.96] at PAX a few years back.
[4749.16 → 4749.44] Right, okay.
[4749.44 → 4750.44] So I didn't like it
[4750.44 → 4752.08] and I don't necessarily
[4752.08 → 4753.26] think you could be as fast
[4753.26 → 4754.16] because on a keyboard
[4754.16 → 4754.74] all your fingers
[4754.74 → 4755.32] will be resting
[4755.32 → 4756.00] on those keys.
[4756.14 → 4756.50] But okay,
[4756.56 → 4756.82] hold on,
[4756.86 → 4757.06] hold on,
[4757.12 → 4757.54] think about this
[4757.54 → 4757.90] for a minute.
[4758.96 → 4759.14] Okay.
[4760.38 → 4760.82] Um.
[4764.78 → 4765.18] Oculus.
[4765.48 → 4765.88] Combining,
[4766.00 → 4766.26] I know,
[4766.36 → 4766.58] exactly.
[4766.76 → 4767.18] Peregrine
[4767.18 → 4768.54] and then something
[4768.54 → 4769.32] like Leapfrog.
[4769.80 → 4770.08] Yep.
[4772.42 → 4773.38] Combining everything
[4773.38 → 4773.84] together.
[4773.94 → 4774.04] Yeah.
[4774.12 → 4774.90] All these technologies
[4774.90 → 4775.72] coming in at one
[4775.72 → 4776.44] is going to make
[4776.44 → 4777.36] them all stronger.
[4777.58 → 4778.88] Omni needs other things
[4778.88 → 4779.46] to be awesome.
[4780.24 → 4781.04] Oculus doesn't
[4781.04 → 4781.80] necessarily need
[4781.80 → 4782.16] other things
[4782.16 → 4782.58] to be awesome
[4782.58 → 4783.34] but raises up
[4783.34 → 4783.90] so much
[4783.90 → 4784.48] when you add
[4784.48 → 4785.16] other things to it.
[4785.54 → 4785.70] So,
[4786.00 → 4786.54] I don't know.
[4787.80 → 4788.80] No way.
[4791.04 → 4793.44] So for the fourth time
[4793.44 → 4794.82] we are attempting
[4794.82 → 4795.70] to record
[4795.70 → 4797.10] the back half
[4797.10 → 4797.96] of this show
[4797.96 → 4800.02] which I think
[4800.02 → 4802.02] is actually
[4802.02 → 4803.26] going to kill
[4803.26 → 4806.08] me and or Slick
[4806.08 → 4807.04] at some point here
[4807.04 → 4808.08] because between
[4808.08 → 4808.70] the technical
[4808.70 → 4809.44] difficulties
[4809.44 → 4810.34] with the initial
[4810.34 → 4810.82] stream
[4810.82 → 4812.44] and then the fact
[4812.44 → 4813.64] that we thought
[4813.64 → 4814.58] we were recording
[4814.58 → 4815.70] and then we weren't
[4815.70 → 4816.54] and then we thought
[4816.54 → 4817.18] we were recording
[4817.18 → 4818.00] again and then we
[4818.00 → 4818.68] weren't because
[4818.68 → 4819.58] I think that was
[4819.58 → 4820.58] my bad that time
[4820.58 → 4821.76] because I think
[4821.76 → 4822.86] I clicked live stream
[4822.86 → 4823.42] and our internet
[4823.42 → 4824.14] is still down.
[4824.68 → 4825.24] Oh, okay.
[4825.46 → 4826.02] And then live stream
[4826.02 → 4826.70] usually does both
[4826.70 → 4827.08] so you thought
[4827.08 → 4827.64] it would be fine
[4827.64 → 4827.86] but the internet's down.
[4827.86 → 4828.30] So I did,
[4828.40 → 4829.64] like I was on autopilot
[4829.64 → 4830.56] I very rarely
[4830.56 → 4831.86] use the local record
[4831.86 → 4832.82] feature because
[4832.82 → 4835.06] this is supposed
[4835.06 → 4836.64] to be a live show
[4836.64 → 4838.20] but it's not
[4838.20 → 4838.96] apparently.
[4839.68 → 4840.52] So back to
[4840.52 → 4841.14] Ashton Kutcher?
[4841.32 → 4842.66] Back to Ashton Kutcher.
[4842.74 → 4843.04] Anyway,
[4843.22 → 4843.76] we left off
[4843.76 → 4844.58] with the Peregrine
[4844.58 → 4845.18] where the clip
[4845.18 → 4846.40] just kind of dies
[4846.40 → 4847.50] and basically
[4847.50 → 4848.20] we're excited
[4848.20 → 4849.48] because Peregrine
[4849.48 → 4851.16] is a glove
[4851.16 → 4852.12] that you can use
[4852.12 → 4852.64] to interact
[4852.64 → 4853.34] with your computer
[4853.34 → 4854.32] and with not
[4854.32 → 4854.84] a keyboard
[4854.84 → 4856.22] and that plus
[4856.22 → 4856.82] Leap Motion
[4856.82 → 4857.40] is cool
[4857.40 → 4857.98] and that plus
[4857.98 → 4858.86] Oculus is cool
[4858.86 → 4859.16] and the way
[4859.16 → 4859.78] it all integrates
[4859.78 → 4860.42] is going to be cool.
[4860.94 → 4861.94] Things that aren't cool
[4861.94 → 4862.90] Ashton Kutcher
[4862.90 → 4863.66] I'm sorry
[4863.66 → 4865.22] but Punk'd wasn't cool
[4865.22 → 4866.70] 70s show was cool
[4866.70 → 4867.26] but dude
[4867.26 → 4868.22] that was an awful
[4868.22 → 4869.06] long time ago
[4869.06 → 4870.18] and this is a
[4870.18 → 4871.08] Gizmodo article
[4871.08 → 4873.12] on was basically
[4873.12 → 4874.24] saying in an email
[4874.24 → 4875.84] that's kind of
[4875.84 → 4877.92] not how it happened
[4877.92 → 4879.80] at all.
[4880.70 → 4881.60] I want to jump in
[4881.60 → 4881.98] right away
[4881.98 → 4882.34] on something
[4882.34 → 4882.84] that it took me
[4882.84 → 4883.42] a while to remember
[4883.42 → 4883.84] before
[4883.84 → 4884.58] but
[4884.58 → 4885.64] In spite of the fact
[4885.64 → 4886.66] that it's in your notes
[4886.66 → 4887.46] for this topic
[4887.46 → 4889.46] you said it the first time
[4889.46 → 4890.90] you said it the second time
[4890.90 → 4891.60] and the third time
[4891.60 → 4891.96] Almost forgot
[4891.96 → 4892.68] the third time
[4892.68 → 4893.42] and then the fourth time
[4893.42 → 4894.26] I'm opening with it
[4894.26 → 4895.20] Opening with it
[4895.20 → 4895.56] Okay
[4895.56 → 4896.58] Hit me
[4896.58 → 4898.54] Go watch Pirates of Silicon Valley
[4898.54 → 4899.88] It's an amazing movie
[4899.88 → 4901.06] and is a perfect
[4901.06 → 4901.96] accurate portrayal
[4901.96 → 4902.50] of the beginning
[4902.50 → 4903.46] of both Microsoft
[4903.46 → 4904.28] and Apple
[4904.28 → 4905.14] So if you want
[4905.14 → 4906.08] all the starting of it
[4906.08 → 4906.80] go back
[4906.80 → 4907.68] watch that movie
[4907.68 → 4908.44] It's an older movie
[4908.44 → 4909.46] It's still perfect
[4909.46 → 4910.42] This has some
[4910.42 → 4912.18] Hollywood-ness going on
[4912.18 → 4913.28] and I mean
[4913.28 → 4914.62] there's like this scene
[4914.62 → 4916.00] in an underground parking lot
[4916.00 → 4917.38] where Jobs is like
[4917.38 → 4918.50] Won
[4918.50 → 4919.40] don't you see
[4919.40 → 4921.32] It's the future of computing
[4921.32 → 4923.10] Holy crap man
[4923.10 → 4924.14] Oh my god
[4924.14 → 4925.34] We're going to change the world
[4925.34 → 4927.18] And from Won's
[4927.18 → 4928.42] sort of interpretation
[4928.42 → 4929.28] He seems to be
[4929.28 → 4930.76] a pretty grounded guy
[4930.76 → 4931.74] with no real incentive
[4931.74 → 4932.86] to lie about things
[4932.86 → 4933.48] at this point
[4933.48 → 4935.42] Not close
[4935.42 → 4937.72] We never had such
[4937.72 → 4938.76] interaction in roles
[4938.76 → 4940.44] I'm not even sure
[4940.44 → 4941.44] what it's getting at
[4941.44 → 4944.24] Personalities are very wrong
[4944.24 → 4945.30] although mine is closer
[4945.30 → 4947.22] Don't forget
[4947.22 → 4948.60] that my purpose
[4948.60 → 4949.76] was inspired by
[4949.76 → 4950.80] the values
[4950.80 → 4951.48] of the Homebrew
[4951.48 → 4952.40] Computer Club
[4952.40 → 4953.60] So
[4953.60 → 4955.44] these ideas
[4955.44 → 4956.16] that
[4956.16 → 4957.08] of computers
[4957.08 → 4957.82] affecting society
[4957.82 → 4958.80] didn't come from Jobs
[4958.80 → 4959.68] They came from
[4959.68 → 4961.28] the Homebrew Computer Club
[4961.28 → 4962.26] They were widely spoken
[4962.26 → 4962.68] about there
[4962.68 → 4963.44] I'm paraphrasing
[4963.44 → 4965.14] Steve Jobs came back
[4965.14 → 4965.66] from Oregon
[4965.66 → 4966.92] came to a club meeting
[4966.92 → 4967.96] and didn't start talking
[4967.96 → 4969.10] about the great social impact
[4969.10 → 4970.08] His idea was to make
[4970.08 → 4971.12] a $20 PC board
[4971.12 → 4971.82] and sell it for $40
[4971.82 → 4973.00] to help people at the club
[4973.00 → 4973.72] build the computer
[4973.72 → 4974.66] He wanted to make some money
[4974.66 → 4975.56] Yes
[4975.56 → 4976.34] And help people
[4976.34 → 4976.88] build computers
[4976.88 → 4977.76] The lofty talk
[4977.76 → 4978.40] came much further
[4978.40 → 4978.96] down the road
[4978.96 → 4979.48] and
[4979.48 → 4981.06] I never looked like
[4981.06 → 4981.60] a professional
[4981.60 → 4982.58] We were both kids
[4982.58 → 4983.30] Our relationship
[4983.30 → 4984.12] was so different
[4984.12 → 4984.98] than what was portrayed
[4984.98 → 4985.74] I'm embarrassed
[4985.74 → 4986.66] But if the movie
[4986.66 → 4987.56] is fun and entertaining
[4987.56 → 4988.16] all the better
[4988.16 → 4989.24] In fact
[4989.24 → 4990.60] looking at the portrayal
[4990.60 → 4991.90] of Jobs in the movie
[4991.90 → 4993.16] based on what
[4993.16 → 4994.44] I've read in the biography
[4994.44 → 4995.40] about him basically
[4995.40 → 4996.74] being a smelly hippie
[4996.74 → 4997.08] Yeah
[4997.08 → 4998.16] That you wouldn't want
[4998.16 → 4999.44] anywhere near
[4999.44 → 5000.36] your furniture
[5000.36 → 5001.04] or children
[5001.04 → 5003.86] It really seems like
[5003.86 → 5004.40] they've
[5004.40 → 5006.28] Go watch
[5006.28 → 5007.64] Pirates of Silicon Valley
[5007.64 → 5008.52] Okay, there
[5008.52 → 5010.08] Now we've done that topic
[5010.08 → 5010.60] Let's move on
[5010.60 → 5011.22] to the next one
[5011.22 → 5011.66] that we're doing
[5011.66 → 5012.94] for the bloody fourth time
[5012.94 → 5014.60] HTC One Max
[5014.60 → 5015.60] I can't even remember
[5015.60 → 5016.14] Is this
[5016.14 → 5017.54] Did we do this before?
[5017.58 → 5018.60] I think we did this before
[5018.60 → 5020.28] Before the bad things
[5020.28 → 5020.38] Maybe
[5020.38 → 5020.88] I don't know
[5020.88 → 5021.78] Okay, we did the felony
[5021.78 → 5023.12] thing before the bad things
[5023.12 → 5024.86] The console thing
[5024.86 → 5026.66] Yeah, console optimizations
[5026.66 → 5027.36] Yes!
[5028.14 → 5029.26] John Carmack again
[5029.26 → 5029.74] I swear
[5029.74 → 5030.42] We could talk about
[5030.42 → 5030.98] how awesome
[5030.98 → 5032.00] John Carmack is
[5032.00 → 5032.68] like forever
[5032.68 → 5033.70] We just did
[5033.70 → 5034.66] We just did
[5034.66 → 5035.74] We have now
[5035.74 → 5036.34] talked about
[5036.34 → 5036.78] how awesome
[5036.78 → 5037.84] John Carmack is forever
[5037.84 → 5038.50] All day
[5038.50 → 5039.70] All day
[5039.70 → 5040.36] we've been talking
[5040.36 → 5041.30] about John Carmack
[5041.30 → 5041.78] You're awesome
[5041.78 → 5043.38] So basically
[5043.38 → 5045.38] the performance boosts
[5045.38 → 5046.62] Oh, this was posted
[5046.62 → 5047.04] on the forum
[5047.04 → 5047.98] by Tech Fanatic
[5047.98 → 5049.38] Matt Digby
[5049.38 → 5050.44] has come out
[5050.44 → 5050.74] and said
[5050.74 → 5052.48] the performance boosts
[5052.48 → 5054.40] that they are achieving
[5054.40 → 5055.38] by optimizing
[5055.38 → 5056.02] their game
[5056.02 → 5057.00] for multicore
[5057.00 → 5058.08] in order to port it
[5058.08 → 5059.32] to the PlayStation 4
[5059.32 → 5060.56] are already
[5060.56 → 5061.98] going to be able
[5061.98 → 5062.60] to affect
[5062.60 → 5063.52] the optimization
[5063.52 → 5065.32] of the PC version
[5065.32 → 5066.58] and Planetwide 2
[5066.58 → 5067.10] is nothing
[5067.10 → 5068.32] if not a poorly
[5068.32 → 5069.16] optimized
[5069.16 → 5070.52] single-thread
[5070.52 → 5072.20] UND single-thread
[5072.20 → 5072.80] only
[5072.80 → 5073.72] game
[5073.72 → 5074.66] So
[5074.66 → 5076.32] the thing about
[5076.32 → 5077.72] PS4 and Xbox One
[5077.72 → 5078.50] is that they might
[5078.50 → 5079.64] have 8-core CPUs
[5079.64 → 5080.04] but man
[5080.04 → 5080.56] they are not
[5080.56 → 5081.34] powerful cores
[5081.34 → 5081.62] No
[5081.62 → 5082.60] They are like
[5082.60 → 5083.64] they are like
[5083.64 → 5084.16] if
[5084.16 → 5084.96] you know
[5084.96 → 5085.86] a vegetarian
[5085.86 → 5087.16] had bulimia
[5087.16 → 5088.32] and wasn't taking
[5088.32 → 5089.32] the proper supplements
[5089.32 → 5089.94] like dude
[5089.94 → 5091.32] they've got no energy
[5091.32 → 5092.72] because they're
[5092.72 → 5093.34] you know
[5093.34 → 5094.50] not supplement
[5094.50 → 5095.00] they don't have
[5095.00 → 5095.80] a correct diet
[5095.80 → 5096.32] and they're not
[5096.32 → 5097.04] keeping their food
[5097.04 → 5098.20] I don't know
[5098.20 → 5098.78] where I'm going
[5098.78 → 5099.26] with this
[5099.26 → 5100.20] I'm tired
[5100.20 → 5101.76] it has actually
[5101.76 → 5102.74] been a phenomenally
[5102.74 → 5103.30] long day
[5103.30 → 5103.86] and I didn't sleep
[5103.86 → 5104.84] until like 5.30
[5104.84 → 5105.86] He's had a different
[5105.86 → 5106.72] way of describing
[5106.72 → 5107.50] those cores
[5107.50 → 5108.94] every single time
[5108.94 → 5109.82] we've done this
[5109.82 → 5110.82] and that was
[5110.82 → 5111.64] the best one
[5111.64 → 5112.84] I think by best
[5112.84 → 5113.54] you're being worse
[5113.54 → 5114.30] Yeah
[5114.30 → 5115.26] Anyway
[5115.26 → 5115.84] the cores
[5115.84 → 5116.94] aren't very powerful
[5116.94 → 5118.56] so for game developers
[5118.56 → 5119.34] to be able
[5119.34 → 5120.04] to leverage
[5120.04 → 5120.92] that power
[5120.92 → 5121.64] we're talking
[5121.64 → 5122.68] we're talking
[5122.68 → 5123.66] cell processor
[5123.66 → 5124.46] all over again
[5124.46 → 5124.90] where it's
[5124.90 → 5125.98] that was way ahead
[5125.98 → 5126.52] of its time
[5126.52 → 5127.22] and no one was able
[5127.22 → 5127.98] to really optimize it
[5127.98 → 5128.22] because it was
[5128.22 → 5129.08] different architecture
[5129.08 → 5129.76] and there was a bunch
[5129.76 → 5130.16] of cores
[5130.16 → 5130.76] and blah blah blah
[5130.76 → 5132.30] now they're x86
[5132.30 → 5133.02] so it's like
[5133.02 → 5133.48] guys
[5133.48 → 5135.34] get your act
[5135.34 → 5136.12] together
[5136.12 → 5138.00] optimize this stuff
[5138.00 → 5139.22] and the PC
[5139.22 → 5140.16] will benefit as well
[5140.16 → 5140.76] which is great
[5140.76 → 5141.64] because developers
[5141.64 → 5142.68] could rely on the PC
[5142.68 → 5143.42] to have these
[5143.42 → 5144.36] Uber
[5144.36 → 5145.94] single thread cores
[5145.94 → 5146.84] and that's on both
[5146.84 → 5148.22] the Intel and AMD side
[5148.22 → 5149.18] but these more
[5149.18 → 5150.26] mobile optimized
[5150.26 → 5151.68] low power consumption
[5151.68 → 5152.82] APU chips
[5152.82 → 5153.50] and these consoles
[5153.50 → 5154.34] aren't able to do it
[5154.34 → 5154.56] so that's
[5154.56 → 5154.96] It's going to be great
[5154.96 → 5155.58] because games like
[5155.58 → 5156.30] Planetwide had no
[5156.30 → 5157.30] real intention of
[5157.30 → 5158.62] updating the performance
[5158.62 → 5159.18] of their game
[5159.18 → 5160.52] who really cares
[5160.52 → 5161.28] they're going to maybe
[5161.28 → 5162.42] Runs well enough
[5162.42 → 5162.68] Yeah
[5162.68 → 5163.58] it's fine
[5163.58 → 5164.52] people know how much
[5164.52 → 5164.98] they need to run
[5164.98 → 5165.46] Planetwide
[5165.46 → 5165.96] so now
[5165.96 → 5166.90] they're optimizing it
[5166.90 → 5167.42] for the console
[5167.42 → 5168.20] and now it's just
[5168.20 → 5168.54] going to make
[5168.54 → 5169.28] everything better
[5169.28 → 5170.06] it's not a bad
[5170.06 → 5170.54] thing at all
[5170.54 → 5172.28] Speaking of optimization
[5172.28 → 5173.30] wait did we talk
[5173.30 → 5174.26] about Kudu is Doomed?
[5174.60 → 5175.26] I have no idea
[5175.26 → 5176.14] I have no idea
[5176.14 → 5176.86] what we talked about
[5176.86 → 5177.16] anyway
[5177.16 → 5178.40] Exchange on the forum
[5178.40 → 5179.38] skip this if we've
[5179.38 → 5180.26] already talked about it
[5180.26 → 5181.26] I don't know
[5181.26 → 5182.54] So
[5182.54 → 5186.66] Oh man
[5186.66 → 5187.72] Basically AMD
[5187.72 → 5188.68] shots fired
[5188.68 → 5189.36] Ron Taylor
[5189.36 → 5190.42] on APU's gaming
[5190.42 → 5191.46] and the end of Kudu
[5191.46 → 5193.28] Basically the summary is
[5193.28 → 5195.26] Kudu is a closed standard
[5195.26 → 5195.88] gamers
[5195.88 → 5197.20] What's this
[5197.20 → 5199.22] This quote is so awesome
[5199.22 → 5201.04] Just fires everything
[5201.04 → 5201.40] Yeah
[5201.40 → 5202.10] All the bullets
[5202.10 → 5203.66] Okay so he's talking
[5203.66 → 5204.46] about Phys
[5204.46 → 5205.58] but because there's
[5205.58 → 5206.42] a parallel being drawn
[5206.42 → 5207.54] between Phys and Kudu
[5207.54 → 5208.10] and that they're both
[5208.10 → 5208.72] closed standards
[5208.72 → 5209.82] unlike OpenCL
[5209.82 → 5211.52] Phys is an utter
[5211.52 → 5212.38] failure because
[5212.38 → 5213.10] it's proprietary
[5213.10 → 5214.66] Nobody wants it
[5214.66 → 5215.64] You don't want it
[5215.64 → 5216.48] I don't want it
[5216.48 → 5217.56] Gamers don't want it
[5217.56 → 5218.94] Analysts don't want it
[5218.94 → 5222.16] So I think that
[5222.16 → 5222.78] pretty much
[5222.78 → 5223.90] that pretty much
[5223.90 → 5224.32] says it
[5224.32 → 5225.20] I mean the thing
[5225.20 → 5226.12] about Phys
[5226.12 → 5227.06] is that
[5227.06 → 5228.20] in the very beginning
[5228.20 → 5229.16] it was much more
[5229.16 → 5230.34] terrible than it is now
[5230.34 → 5231.22] It was like
[5231.22 → 5232.32] this weird dedicated
[5232.32 → 5233.34] card that ran in a
[5233.34 → 5234.80] PCI slot of all things
[5234.80 → 5235.08] I mean
[5235.08 → 5236.14] Nobody really bought it
[5236.14 → 5236.80] Yeah if anyone
[5236.80 → 5237.76] needed to
[5237.76 → 5238.92] sort of
[5238.92 → 5239.94] work through their
[5239.94 → 5240.50] mind that it
[5240.50 → 5241.36] wasn't doing anything
[5241.36 → 5242.22] the fact that it
[5242.22 → 5243.50] ran in a PCI slot
[5243.50 → 5245.22] meant that there
[5245.22 → 5246.12] probably wasn't much
[5246.12 → 5247.02] data transfer going
[5247.02 → 5247.44] on here
[5247.44 → 5247.94] so it probably
[5247.94 → 5248.20] wasn't
[5248.20 → 5249.04] I mean that's
[5249.04 → 5249.86] an oversimplification
[5249.86 → 5251.22] It could be doing
[5251.22 → 5252.04] a lot of work on
[5252.04 → 5252.70] its side and then
[5252.70 → 5253.50] spitting out results
[5253.50 → 5254.02] that don't require
[5254.02 → 5254.48] much bandwidth
[5254.48 → 5255.10] but I'm just
[5255.10 → 5255.82] I'm kind of making
[5255.82 → 5256.38] fun of it
[5256.38 → 5258.16] and then it got
[5258.16 → 5258.90] better when NVIDIA
[5258.90 → 5259.54] acquired them
[5259.54 → 5260.32] and now anyone
[5260.32 → 5260.92] with an NVIDIA
[5260.92 → 5261.72] graphics card was
[5261.72 → 5262.70] able to run
[5262.70 → 5263.96] Phys accelerated
[5263.96 → 5264.68] CUBA accelerated
[5264.68 → 5265.50] Phys all that stuff
[5265.50 → 5266.32] but at the end
[5266.32 → 5266.76] of the day
[5266.76 → 5267.66] I think that
[5267.66 → 5268.82] I think he's right
[5268.82 → 5270.60] I think open standards
[5270.60 → 5271.32] like OpenCL
[5271.32 → 5272.00] are going to be
[5272.00 → 5272.46] the future
[5272.46 → 5273.00] I mean you look
[5273.00 → 5273.66] at even companies
[5273.66 → 5274.16] like Adobe
[5274.16 → 5275.04] what a major win
[5275.04 → 5275.52] that was
[5275.52 → 5276.82] CS6 running CUBA
[5276.82 → 5277.44] That might have
[5277.44 → 5278.24] just won it for them
[5278.24 → 5278.86] because okay
[5278.86 → 5279.70] open platforms
[5279.70 → 5280.42] and computers
[5280.42 → 5281.06] go together
[5281.06 → 5281.78] like nothing ever
[5281.78 → 5282.18] before
[5282.18 → 5283.22] people love
[5283.22 → 5283.90] open platforms
[5283.90 → 5284.48] on computers
[5284.48 → 5285.86] I'm trying to
[5285.86 → 5286.30] find a different
[5286.30 → 5286.82] way to say this
[5286.82 → 5287.28] than every single
[5287.28 → 5287.80] other time I've
[5287.80 → 5288.30] said it
[5288.30 → 5289.50] you don't have to
[5289.50 → 5289.90] it's okay
[5289.90 → 5291.06] just go verbatim
[5291.06 → 5291.60] and they'll
[5291.60 → 5292.46] bear with it
[5292.46 → 5293.28] there's paid
[5293.28 → 5293.76] which people
[5293.76 → 5294.94] aren't totally
[5294.94 → 5295.80] into on computers
[5295.80 → 5296.62] then there's free
[5296.62 → 5297.54] which is kind of
[5297.54 → 5297.94] a big deal
[5297.94 → 5298.66] then there's open
[5298.66 → 5299.10] which is on a
[5299.10 → 5299.62] completely different
[5299.62 → 5300.06] platform
[5300.06 → 5301.18] because the second
[5301.18 → 5302.00] you bring out open
[5302.00 → 5302.96] everyone can optimize
[5302.96 → 5303.88] it for their own
[5303.88 → 5304.40] usage
[5304.40 → 5305.10] and they can either
[5305.10 → 5306.02] deliver it for free
[5306.02 → 5306.90] or they can charge
[5306.90 → 5307.36] money for it
[5307.36 → 5307.64] or they can charge
[5307.64 → 5308.16] money for it
[5308.16 → 5308.80] depending on how
[5308.80 → 5310.02] they augment it
[5310.02 → 5311.16] but when someone
[5311.16 → 5312.04] like Adobe
[5312.04 → 5312.68] backs it
[5312.68 → 5313.52] you know that Adobe
[5313.52 → 5313.94] is going to
[5313.94 → 5315.06] probably be
[5315.06 → 5316.08] contributing in some
[5316.08 → 5316.34] way
[5316.34 → 5316.84] yes
[5316.84 → 5317.72] and I mean the
[5317.72 → 5318.30] thing is that
[5318.30 → 5318.94] it's not like
[5318.94 → 5320.52] CUBA's dead
[5320.52 → 5320.92] no
[5320.92 → 5321.80] it's certainly
[5321.80 → 5322.68] not dead today
[5322.68 → 5323.40] I mean look at
[5323.40 → 5324.04] something like the
[5324.04 → 5324.86] Titan supercomputer
[5324.86 → 5326.24] any kind of
[5326.24 → 5327.56] specialized application
[5327.56 → 5328.52] where you're really
[5328.52 → 5329.94] like specialized
[5329.94 → 5330.76] hardware and
[5330.76 → 5331.90] specialized programming
[5331.90 → 5332.62] languages may
[5332.62 → 5333.56] actually be optimal
[5333.56 → 5334.36] for an application
[5334.36 → 5335.00] like that
[5335.00 → 5336.02] where you are
[5336.02 → 5337.82] really dialling down
[5337.82 → 5339.00] into the hardware
[5339.00 → 5339.82] to get the absolute
[5339.82 → 5340.46] most out of it
[5340.46 → 5341.04] and you're purpose
[5341.04 → 5341.86] building a single
[5341.86 → 5342.66] machine and purpose
[5342.66 → 5343.34] building software
[5343.34 → 5344.26] to run on it
[5344.26 → 5345.48] but then again
[5345.48 → 5346.26] maybe that's what
[5346.26 → 5347.22] Ron's talking about
[5347.22 → 5348.52] is maybe we
[5348.52 → 5349.18] shouldn't purpose
[5349.18 → 5350.00] build software
[5350.00 → 5350.42] and purpose
[5350.42 → 5351.00] build machines
[5351.00 → 5351.18] because at the same
[5351.18 → 5352.32] time if you take
[5352.32 → 5353.40] an open platform
[5353.40 → 5355.60] you can hack into
[5355.60 → 5356.44] it and change things
[5356.44 → 5357.18] to make it purpose
[5357.18 → 5357.48] built
[5357.48 → 5358.18] yes
[5358.18 → 5359.66] so open is
[5359.66 → 5361.52] great and that's
[5361.52 → 5362.36] basically what he's
[5362.36 → 5362.54] saying
[5362.54 → 5364.64] so there you go
[5364.64 → 5366.18] yet another thing
[5366.18 → 5367.60] that we
[5367.60 → 5368.74] something talked
[5368.74 → 5369.56] about before
[5369.56 → 5370.14] but now we're
[5370.14 → 5370.86] talking about again
[5370.86 → 5374.08] did we talk about
[5374.08 → 5375.46] 3D Flash yet
[5375.46 → 5376.84] ah yes
[5376.84 → 5377.50] no we didn't
[5377.50 → 5377.80] okay
[5377.80 → 5379.10] Samsung changing
[5379.10 → 5380.42] the SSD game
[5380.42 → 5381.36] again
[5381.36 → 5382.96] with 3D vertical
[5382.96 → 5383.78] NAND flash
[5383.78 → 5384.74] this is fantastic
[5384.74 → 5386.40] because Samsung's
[5386.40 → 5387.64] already using
[5387.64 → 5388.82] really innovative
[5388.82 → 5389.74] strategies to bring
[5389.74 → 5390.50] more performance
[5390.50 → 5391.16] to SSD
[5391.16 → 5392.20] so things like
[5392.20 → 5392.90] RAM caching
[5392.90 → 5393.64] with their rapid
[5393.64 → 5394.26] technology
[5394.26 → 5395.32] as well as
[5395.32 → 5396.70] that weird mode
[5396.70 → 5397.86] I don't even
[5397.86 → 5398.32] remember what
[5398.32 → 5398.90] they call it
[5398.90 → 5399.48] but basically
[5399.48 → 5400.52] they're emulating
[5400.52 → 5402.34] SLC Flash
[5402.34 → 5403.84] operation on TLC
[5403.84 → 5405.08] Flash in order
[5405.08 → 5405.84] to get a performance
[5405.84 → 5406.54] boost that's
[5406.54 → 5407.94] temporary but
[5407.94 → 5409.06] very, very real
[5409.06 → 5409.84] and something that
[5409.84 → 5410.64] many users will be
[5410.64 → 5411.30] able to realize
[5411.30 → 5412.32] a lot of the time
[5412.32 → 5412.62] definitely
[5412.62 → 5413.70] now they're driving
[5413.70 → 5414.34] capacity
[5414.34 → 5416.08] how many layers
[5416.08 → 5416.50] is this?
[5416.72 → 5417.56] 24 I believe
[5417.56 → 5418.22] so there's
[5418.22 → 5418.74] it is
[5418.74 → 5420.16] yes 24 layers
[5420.16 → 5420.52] vertically
[5420.52 → 5421.06] they can stack
[5421.06 → 5421.96] 24 layers of
[5421.96 → 5422.80] traditional styled
[5422.80 → 5423.24] flash
[5423.24 → 5423.74] this was posted
[5423.74 → 5424.38] by Muddy Mucks
[5424.38 → 5424.84] on the forum
[5424.84 → 5425.18] by the way
[5425.18 → 5425.96] on top of each
[5425.96 → 5426.68] other's vertically
[5426.68 → 5427.36] so just
[5427.36 → 5428.48] oh your capacities
[5428.48 → 5429.38] are going to explode
[5429.38 → 5430.06] so we're going to
[5430.06 → 5430.72] be talking about
[5430.72 → 5431.74] smartphones that
[5431.74 → 5432.44] instead of coming
[5432.44 → 5435.94] in 16 32 and 64 gig
[5435.94 → 5437.86] like they have been
[5437.86 → 5438.90] since the dawn of
[5438.90 → 5439.84] bloody time
[5439.84 → 5440.76] we might be talking
[5440.76 → 5442.22] about 384 gig
[5442.22 → 5442.74] smartphone
[5442.74 → 5444.50] aw yeah
[5444.50 → 5445.26] I mean come on
[5445.26 → 5446.34] like iPad 1
[5446.34 → 5446.92] had the same
[5446.92 → 5447.88] capacities available
[5447.88 → 5449.06] as iPad 4
[5449.06 → 5450.34] which is brutal
[5450.34 → 5451.18] and you look at
[5451.18 → 5451.76] Apple
[5451.76 → 5452.90] they actually are
[5452.90 → 5453.46] trying to drive
[5453.46 → 5454.08] things forward
[5454.08 → 5454.84] look at how
[5454.84 → 5455.88] quickly they launched
[5455.88 → 5456.70] iPad 4 after
[5456.70 → 5457.22] iPad 3
[5457.22 → 5458.40] because we can
[5458.40 → 5459.16] we can build
[5459.16 → 5459.66] something more
[5459.66 → 5460.04] powerful
[5460.04 → 5460.88] so here it is
[5460.88 → 5462.32] does it bone
[5462.32 → 5462.92] people who just
[5462.92 → 5463.72] bought an iPad 3
[5463.72 → 5464.16] a little bit
[5464.16 → 5464.76] oh I don't know
[5464.76 → 5465.00] maybe
[5465.00 → 5465.74] but
[5465.74 → 5466.90] here's a higher
[5466.90 → 5467.70] resolution display
[5467.70 → 5468.42] because we can
[5468.42 → 5468.88] here's a more
[5468.88 → 5470.04] faster processor
[5470.04 → 5470.88] because we can
[5470.88 → 5471.86] and I think if they
[5471.86 → 5472.30] could deliver
[5472.30 → 5473.10] higher capacities
[5473.10 → 5473.86] while maintaining
[5473.86 → 5474.72] their lucrative
[5474.72 → 5475.84] product profit
[5475.84 → 5476.70] margins they would
[5476.70 → 5477.92] this will enable
[5477.92 → 5478.20] it
[5478.20 → 5478.90] so yay
[5478.90 → 5482.00] stack and stuff
[5482.00 → 5482.86] find another topic
[5482.86 → 5483.78] go
[5483.78 → 5485.00] what have we
[5485.00 → 5486.02] not talked about
[5486.02 → 5487.20] Nvidia tablet
[5487.20 → 5487.92] market thing
[5487.92 → 5488.34] yes
[5488.34 → 5489.76] Nvidia diving
[5489.76 → 5490.36] into tablets
[5490.36 → 5491.44] beyond Nvidia
[5491.44 → 5491.84] shield
[5491.84 → 5492.40] which hopefully
[5492.40 → 5492.96] ours is going
[5492.96 → 5493.62] to arrive soon
[5493.62 → 5494.34] so what we
[5494.34 → 5494.86] were discussing
[5494.86 → 5495.76] was how
[5495.76 → 5496.52] Microsoft tried
[5496.52 → 5497.04] to dive into
[5497.04 → 5497.70] tablets and it
[5497.70 → 5498.22] was a very
[5498.22 → 5499.30] very bad thing
[5499.30 → 5500.48] very, very bad
[5500.48 → 5500.80] thing
[5500.80 → 5501.70] and how
[5501.70 → 5502.56] while this is
[5502.56 → 5503.00] dangerous
[5503.00 → 5503.62] and I think
[5503.62 → 5504.18] jumping into the
[5504.18 → 5504.96] tablet game at this
[5504.96 → 5505.46] point in time
[5505.46 → 5506.64] is borderline
[5506.64 → 5507.22] suicidal
[5507.22 → 5508.42] posted by Tasha
[5508.42 → 5508.94] on the forum
[5508.94 → 5509.28] by the way
[5509.28 → 5509.58] there's a
[5509.58 → 5510.40] maximum PC article
[5510.40 → 5510.80] that we're going
[5510.80 → 5511.10] to go to
[5511.10 → 5511.62] so go ahead
[5511.62 → 5511.80] yep
[5511.80 → 5513.50] it's borderline
[5513.50 → 5514.26] suicidal but if
[5514.26 → 5514.82] someone's going to
[5514.82 → 5515.46] do it is might as
[5515.46 → 5516.02] well be Nvidia
[5516.02 → 5516.92] because they're
[5516.92 → 5517.28] going to gain
[5517.28 → 5518.04] some experience
[5518.04 → 5519.24] from their shield
[5519.24 → 5520.06] and they're going
[5520.06 → 5520.46] to get more
[5520.46 → 5521.14] developers looking
[5521.14 → 5521.66] into building
[5521.66 → 5522.70] that style of
[5522.70 → 5523.54] android game
[5523.54 → 5524.22] not necessarily
[5524.22 → 5524.94] touchscreen android
[5524.94 → 5525.12] game
[5525.12 → 5526.02] and then they're
[5526.02 → 5526.32] going to come
[5526.32 → 5526.72] out with a
[5526.72 → 5527.04] tablet
[5527.04 → 5528.22] and that tablet
[5528.22 → 5528.80] will probably
[5528.80 → 5529.62] like here
[5529.62 → 5531.14] controllers what not
[5531.14 → 5531.94] like it's going
[5531.94 → 5532.74] to be Terra 5
[5532.74 → 5533.30] it's going to be
[5533.30 → 5533.70] gaming
[5533.70 → 5535.08] and I mean
[5535.08 → 5535.72] you look at what
[5535.72 → 5536.34] they're doing on
[5536.34 → 5537.36] the software side
[5537.36 → 5537.76] as well
[5537.76 → 5538.32] it's more than
[5538.32 → 5538.98] just the hardware
[5538.98 → 5539.80] with these guys
[5539.80 → 5540.72] lately, and I mean
[5540.72 → 5541.58] that's what
[5541.58 → 5542.08] and it's funny
[5542.08 → 5543.00] because that
[5543.00 → 5543.86] that article
[5543.86 → 5544.58] has a link
[5544.58 → 5545.50] or has a picture
[5545.50 → 5546.48] of the Racer
[5546.48 → 5546.90] Edge
[5546.90 → 5547.84] and that's another
[5547.84 → 5548.50] company that's
[5548.50 → 5548.90] trying to
[5548.90 → 5550.04] differentiate based
[5550.04 → 5551.56] on not only
[5551.56 → 5553.10] hardware but also
[5553.10 → 5553.98] software so you
[5553.98 → 5554.30] look at what
[5554.30 → 5554.82] they're doing with
[5554.82 → 5555.64] comes which by
[5555.64 → 5556.28] the way guys
[5556.28 → 5557.38] we are powered by
[5557.38 → 5558.04] Racer comes
[5558.04 → 5558.84] download it here
[5558.84 → 5559.44] if you haven't
[5559.44 → 5560.52] already try it out
[5560.52 → 5561.12] it's free
[5561.12 → 5562.24] it's voice chat
[5562.24 → 5562.82] software that
[5562.82 → 5563.32] doesn't require
[5563.32 → 5563.78] any kind of
[5563.78 → 5564.28] server or any
[5564.28 → 5564.92] kind of complicated
[5564.92 → 5565.96] setup and anyway
[5565.96 → 5566.32] that's what
[5566.32 → 5566.94] Nvidia is doing
[5566.94 → 5567.64] shadow play
[5567.64 → 5569.18] GeForce experience
[5569.18 → 5570.26] it's more than
[5570.26 → 5571.26] just FPS now
[5571.26 → 5571.84] yeah yeah
[5571.84 → 5572.86] and the built-in
[5572.86 → 5573.98] H.264 encoding
[5573.98 → 5574.52] in Kepler
[5574.52 → 5577.30] may be a big
[5577.30 → 5578.08] part of this
[5578.08 → 5578.80] upcoming tablet
[5578.80 → 5579.88] I fully expect
[5579.88 → 5580.60] them you said
[5580.60 → 5581.14] that was a picture
[5581.14 → 5581.50] of the Racer
[5581.50 → 5582.28] tablet and yeah
[5582.28 → 5583.22] but I fully expect
[5583.22 → 5583.84] them to have some
[5583.84 → 5584.58] type of controllers
[5584.58 → 5585.18] oh yeah I
[5585.18 → 5585.82] wouldn't be surprised
[5585.82 → 5586.18] at all
[5586.18 → 5587.42] probably similar to
[5587.42 → 5588.00] that style or
[5588.00 → 5588.88] something like that
[5588.88 → 5589.52] style and I mean
[5589.52 → 5591.02] with H.264 encode
[5591.02 → 5592.14] like with shield
[5592.14 → 5593.14] you're able to use
[5593.14 → 5594.34] a Kepler grade GPU
[5594.34 → 5595.72] to push to it
[5595.72 → 5596.96] and it can decode it
[5596.96 → 5597.24] yeah
[5597.24 → 5598.26] but this is an
[5598.26 → 5598.92] older architecture
[5598.92 → 5599.74] now at this point
[5599.74 → 5600.62] whereas if we have
[5600.62 → 5601.54] a Kepler based on
[5601.54 → 5602.12] the tablet
[5602.12 → 5603.44] now all of a sudden
[5603.44 → 5604.18] standards like
[5604.18 → 5604.98] Wi-Fi that
[5604.98 → 5606.32] are I mean
[5606.32 → 5606.98] come on
[5606.98 → 5607.38] who's the
[5607.38 → 5608.88] put up your hand
[5608.88 → 5609.96] if you actually
[5609.96 → 5611.02] used Wi-Fi at
[5611.02 → 5611.52] some point
[5611.52 → 5613.06] other than at work
[5613.06 → 5613.82] no, so I'm not
[5613.82 → 5614.12] going to put up
[5614.12 → 5614.50] my hand
[5614.50 → 5615.44] so okay
[5615.44 → 5616.48] Wi-Fi
[5616.48 → 5617.12] you know
[5617.12 → 5617.54] you look at
[5617.54 → 5618.16] devices like
[5618.16 → 5618.80] Chromecast
[5618.80 → 5619.26] we might be
[5619.26 → 5619.88] looking at
[5619.88 → 5621.26] with built-in
[5621.26 → 5621.80] hardware and
[5621.80 → 5622.74] coding ways to
[5622.74 → 5624.32] stream much
[5624.32 → 5625.06] higher bit rate
[5625.06 → 5625.56] much higher
[5625.56 → 5626.98] quality video
[5626.98 → 5627.98] streams with
[5627.98 → 5629.14] dumb dongles
[5629.14 → 5629.64] on the other
[5629.64 → 5630.92] end and by the
[5630.92 → 5631.80] time that rolls
[5631.80 → 5632.26] around we might
[5632.26 → 5632.66] have a next
[5632.66 → 5633.68] generation Chromecast
[5633.68 → 5634.36] or something like
[5634.36 → 5635.16] that that's
[5635.16 → 5636.42] a perfect match
[5636.42 → 5636.78] for it
[5636.78 → 5637.42] yep definitely
[5637.42 → 5638.00] definitely
[5638.00 → 5639.22] extremely exciting
[5639.22 → 5640.24] so if anyone's
[5640.24 → 5640.72] going to pull it
[5640.72 → 5641.34] off probably
[5641.34 → 5641.70] Nvidia
[5641.70 → 5642.44] probably Nvidia
[5642.44 → 5643.38] so it's still
[5643.38 → 5643.88] crazy
[5643.88 → 5644.74] yeah it's still
[5644.74 → 5645.06] insane
[5645.06 → 5646.18] but they could
[5646.18 → 5646.90] do it
[5646.90 → 5647.56] which is cool
[5647.56 → 5650.26] was that all we
[5650.26 → 5650.76] did before
[5650.76 → 5651.26] build logs
[5651.26 → 5651.92] or did we
[5651.92 → 5652.52] do more
[5652.52 → 5653.72] we had the
[5653.72 → 5655.26] radio 9970
[5655.26 → 5655.80] rumours
[5655.80 → 5657.28] so this is the
[5657.28 → 5658.68] volcanic islands
[5658.68 → 5660.24] series of GPUs
[5660.24 → 5660.72] which is sort of
[5660.72 → 5661.80] appropriate because
[5661.80 → 5663.98] per verse's post
[5663.98 → 5664.66] on the forum
[5664.66 → 5665.92] the rumour is the
[5665.92 → 5667.04] 9970 will have
[5667.04 → 5668.12] a 300 watt
[5668.12 → 5668.92] TDP which
[5668.92 → 5670.28] actually if
[5670.28 → 5670.88] that's true I
[5670.88 → 5671.42] can't imagine
[5671.42 → 5671.96] that's true that
[5671.96 → 5672.88] should exceed the
[5672.88 → 5673.46] PCI Express
[5673.46 → 5674.52] standard I believe
[5674.52 → 5675.66] I thought it was
[5675.66 → 5676.98] 275 max
[5676.98 → 5678.20] that's interesting I
[5678.20 → 5678.64] didn't even think
[5678.64 → 5679.06] about that
[5679.06 → 5679.92] I could be wrong
[5679.92 → 5680.62] I could be wrong
[5680.62 → 5681.20] but anyway
[5681.20 → 5683.38] huge TDP this is
[5683.38 → 5684.44] the rumoured card
[5684.44 → 5685.54] the code name is
[5685.54 → 5686.64] Hawaii there's also
[5686.64 → 5687.44] a rumour that
[5687.44 → 5688.12] they're gonna launch
[5688.12 → 5688.76] it in Hawaii
[5688.76 → 5689.74] it's like a special
[5689.74 → 5690.46] press event
[5690.46 → 5691.42] that would be kind
[5691.42 → 5691.90] of cool
[5691.90 → 5694.22] prepare your water
[5694.22 → 5694.72] blocks
[5694.72 → 5695.62] oh seriously
[5695.62 → 5696.38] post here
[5696.38 → 5697.02] I did
[5697.02 → 5698.98] we've talked a
[5698.98 → 5699.58] few times about
[5699.58 → 5700.26] how water cooling
[5700.26 → 5701.52] not being as big
[5701.52 → 5702.18] of a deal as it
[5702.18 → 5702.68] was before
[5702.68 → 5703.58] on graphics cards
[5703.58 → 5704.20] it's becoming a
[5704.20 → 5704.68] bigger deal
[5704.68 → 5705.44] hello yeah
[5705.44 → 5705.94] exactly
[5705.94 → 5707.30] Titan this
[5707.30 → 5708.46] speaking of Titan
[5708.46 → 5709.06] the rumoured
[5709.06 → 5710.44] performance is
[5710.44 → 5710.92] that it'll be
[5710.92 → 5711.76] around 5%
[5711.76 → 5712.38] faster than
[5712.38 → 5712.66] Titan
[5712.66 → 5714.74] so while we
[5714.74 → 5715.58] can't confirm
[5715.58 → 5716.28] nor deny the
[5716.28 → 5716.90] rumours because we
[5716.90 → 5717.64] actually don't
[5717.64 → 5718.08] know
[5718.08 → 5718.92] there's oh
[5718.92 → 5719.56] wait there's a
[5719.56 → 5720.12] lot of stuff in
[5720.12 → 5720.74] here about specs
[5720.74 → 5721.34] so they're claiming
[5721.34 → 5722.28] 1 gigahertz clock
[5722.28 → 5722.90] speeds with
[5722.90 → 5724.84] 4,000 shader units
[5724.84 → 5726.52] effective memory
[5726.52 → 5727.18] clock of anywhere
[5727.18 → 5728.08] from 6 gigahertz
[5728.08 → 5729.20] to 6 7 gigahertz
[5729.20 → 5730.20] 5 12 bit bus
[5730.20 → 5731.24] 4 gigs of
[5731.24 → 5733.10] GDDR5 memory
[5733.10 → 5736.28] I guess it's
[5736.28 → 5736.98] kind of in line
[5736.98 → 5738.36] with even though
[5738.36 → 5739.10] we can't confirm
[5739.10 → 5739.90] or deny
[5739.90 → 5741.42] kind of in line
[5741.42 → 5742.04] with what AMD's
[5742.04 → 5742.50] been doing
[5742.50 → 5743.68] it makes sense
[5743.68 → 5744.12] they slashed
[5744.12 → 5744.66] pricing on the
[5744.66 → 5745.36] 7990
[5745.36 → 5747.96] got that driver
[5747.96 → 5748.84] out slash pricing
[5748.84 → 5749.36] I don't know
[5749.36 → 5749.74] if you saw
[5749.74 → 5750.52] net linked but
[5750.52 → 5751.72] there was a 7970
[5751.72 → 5752.98] for like 329
[5752.98 → 5754.46] which is pretty
[5754.46 → 5755.12] cheap so it
[5755.12 → 5755.86] is pretty cheap
[5755.86 → 5756.60] yeah it's looking
[5756.60 → 5757.74] like they're
[5757.74 → 5758.68] adjusting pricing
[5758.68 → 5759.34] in their product
[5759.34 → 5759.98] stack to make
[5759.98 → 5760.58] room for these
[5760.58 → 5761.22] before they even
[5761.22 → 5761.62] arrive
[5761.62 → 5764.92] so yeah
[5764.92 → 5765.98] it could be a
[5765.98 → 5766.84] very exciting time
[5766.84 → 5767.58] for graphics cards
[5767.58 → 5768.10] over the next
[5768.10 → 5768.54] little bit here
[5768.54 → 5769.34] graphics cards have
[5769.34 → 5770.00] been really exciting
[5770.00 → 5770.50] for a little bit
[5770.50 → 5771.86] and AMD has
[5771.86 → 5772.90] been kind of
[5772.90 → 5773.90] doing things a
[5773.90 → 5774.56] little differently
[5774.56 → 5775.72] like coming out
[5775.72 → 5776.92] and saying no
[5776.92 → 5777.98] new GPUs this
[5777.98 → 5778.84] year and then
[5778.84 → 5779.84] just and then
[5779.84 → 5780.48] releasing one
[5780.48 → 5781.24] like immediately
[5781.24 → 5782.58] with the 7790
[5782.58 → 5784.36] I was a different
[5784.36 → 5785.88] architecture and
[5785.88 → 5787.46] then like it's
[5787.46 → 5788.52] like September
[5788.52 → 5790.06] which is last
[5790.06 → 5790.84] time I checked
[5790.84 → 5791.70] in the same
[5791.70 → 5793.26] calendar year as
[5793.26 → 5793.96] like February
[5793.96 → 5794.72] when they were
[5794.72 → 5795.40] saying this
[5795.40 → 5799.50] I say pardon
[5799.50 → 5801.04] so guys
[5801.04 → 5802.64] where does your
[5802.64 → 5803.42] year start
[5803.42 → 5804.52] yo dogs
[5804.52 → 5805.94] I heard you
[5805.94 → 5807.18] like sort of
[5807.18 → 5809.40] throwing everyone
[5809.40 → 5810.12] off a cliff
[5810.12 → 5810.88] in terms of
[5810.88 → 5811.60] how closely
[5811.60 → 5812.32] they're able to
[5812.32 → 5813.02] follow along with
[5813.02 → 5813.78] what you're doing
[5813.78 → 5814.62] exactly over there
[5814.62 → 5815.76] I mean I guess
[5815.76 → 5816.64] it's good because
[5816.64 → 5817.18] you know you don't
[5817.18 → 5817.92] want your competitor
[5817.92 → 5818.80] getting the drop on
[5818.80 → 5819.52] you or anything like
[5819.52 → 5820.14] that but
[5820.14 → 5822.88] which normally it
[5822.88 → 5823.54] seems like everyone
[5823.54 → 5824.44] does but in this
[5824.44 → 5825.32] case not necessarily
[5825.32 → 5826.84] yeah yeah yeah
[5826.84 → 5828.14] all right why don't
[5828.14 → 5828.86] we tackle one more
[5828.86 → 5829.76] topic before we do
[5829.76 → 5830.46] builds of the week
[5830.46 → 5831.42] and then we can
[5831.42 → 5832.66] sign off for the
[5832.66 → 5833.72] fourth bloody time
[5833.72 → 5834.68] on this
[5834.68 → 5836.46] here why don't we
[5836.46 → 5837.36] do something that we
[5837.36 → 5838.34] skipped last time
[5838.34 → 5839.88] Microsoft digs more
[5839.88 → 5841.38] holes for its
[5841.38 → 5842.32] console
[5842.32 → 5849.46] those movies
[5849.46 → 5850.36] crashed as badly
[5850.36 → 5850.96] with the fourth
[5850.96 → 5852.48] instalment as the
[5852.48 → 5853.46] X I wish it was the
[5853.46 → 5854.26] fourth Xbox wouldn't
[5854.26 → 5857.22] that be great I love
[5857.22 → 5858.10] Harrison Ford and
[5858.10 → 5859.10] Indiana Jones as much
[5859.10 → 5860.66] as anyone but
[5860.66 → 5861.66] speaking of which
[5861.66 → 5862.44] Harrison Ford is
[5862.44 → 5863.42] apparently going to be
[5863.42 → 5863.90] in the new
[5863.90 → 5864.82] Expendables movie
[5864.82 → 5866.52] really yeah Bruce
[5866.52 → 5867.80] Willis was asking for
[5867.80 → 5868.84] a million dollars a
[5868.84 → 5870.32] day they offered him
[5870.32 → 5871.68] three million for four
[5871.68 → 5873.26] days, and he held
[5873.26 → 5874.96] out and Stallone
[5874.96 → 5875.98] replaced him within
[5875.98 → 5878.06] 72 hours with on
[5878.06 → 5878.86] his Twitter he was
[5878.86 → 5880.50] like a better actor
[5880.50 → 5882.56] a nicer guy and
[5882.56 → 5883.10] then he said
[5883.10 → 5883.78] something on Twitter
[5883.78 → 5885.20] about how like being
[5885.20 → 5887.12] lazy and greedy is a
[5887.12 → 5888.14] bad career move or
[5888.14 → 5888.88] something like that
[5888.88 → 5889.62] so well this is
[5889.62 → 5890.26] supposed to the
[5890.26 → 5891.00] whole idea of
[5891.00 → 5891.78] Expendables was
[5891.78 → 5892.24] they were just
[5892.24 → 5892.78] screwing around
[5892.78 → 5894.22] was it not the
[5894.22 → 5894.88] first movie was
[5894.88 → 5895.70] terrible so they
[5895.70 → 5896.04] couldn't have
[5896.04 → 5896.86] possibly been trying
[5896.86 → 5897.54] to make a serious
[5897.54 → 5898.28] movie it was
[5898.28 → 5899.12] supposed to be just
[5899.12 → 5899.82] like everyone getting
[5899.82 → 5901.22] back together at
[5901.22 → 5901.78] we're kind of
[5901.78 → 5902.32] getting older now
[5902.32 → 5902.70] it's kind of the
[5902.70 → 5903.24] end of our careers
[5903.24 → 5903.94] let's just make a
[5903.94 → 5904.60] movie and have fun
[5904.60 → 5905.86] that's I read that
[5905.86 → 5906.44] and then here we
[5906.44 → 5908.16] are three movies
[5908.16 → 5908.88] into the hint
[5908.88 → 5909.96] who cares
[5909.96 → 5911.72] whatever I refused
[5911.72 → 5912.60] to watch the second
[5912.60 → 5913.26] one based on how
[5913.26 → 5913.88] terrible the first
[5913.88 → 5914.50] one was I don't
[5914.50 → 5915.54] think it's for you
[5915.54 → 5918.08] I think they're
[5918.08 → 5918.96] having fun on their
[5918.96 → 5919.34] own
[5919.34 → 5920.38] well whatever
[5920.38 → 5922.84] DLF posts on the
[5922.84 → 5924.28] forum this is this
[5924.28 → 5925.80] is a article from
[5925.80 → 5927.86] one hit pixel oh this
[5927.86 → 5930.18] is just terrible because
[5930.18 → 5931.40] game streaming is such
[5931.40 → 5933.28] a big thing and you
[5933.28 → 5934.36] look at companies like
[5934.36 → 5935.58] twitch where we stream
[5935.58 → 5936.34] our where we do our
[5936.34 → 5937.68] live stream and
[5937.68 → 5938.52] everyone's trying to
[5938.52 → 5939.38] figure out how to
[5939.38 → 5940.56] cash in on game
[5940.56 → 5942.06] streaming Microsoft
[5942.06 → 5943.12] apparently thinks the
[5943.12 → 5944.22] method to cash in is
[5944.22 → 5945.62] going to be to require
[5945.62 → 5947.32] users to pay for
[5947.32 → 5950.20] Xbox Live gold one
[5950.20 → 5951.26] thing is people are
[5951.26 → 5951.90] probably going to be
[5951.90 → 5952.66] streaming multiplayer
[5952.66 → 5953.54] games just to be
[5953.54 → 5954.48] completely honest if
[5954.48 → 5954.82] you're playing a
[5954.82 → 5955.58] multiplayer game you
[5955.58 → 5956.58] have Xbox gold
[5956.58 → 5957.90] anyway okay that much
[5957.90 → 5960.84] is true I'm gonna I'm
[5960.84 → 5961.32] going to play devil's
[5961.32 → 5962.56] advocate of
[5962.56 → 5964.98] ever mark my words
[5964.98 → 5965.92] sign up for a
[5965.92 → 5966.96] subscription based
[5966.96 → 5970.08] server it's not gonna
[5970.08 → 5971.08] happen so you're not
[5971.08 → 5972.74] so I won't sign up for
[5972.74 → 5973.82] a pay per month MMO
[5973.82 → 5975.42] you're not a console
[5975.42 → 5977.56] player I know but I
[5977.56 → 5978.58] mean even on PC I
[5978.58 → 5979.30] won't sign up for a
[5979.30 → 5980.84] pay per month MMO I'm
[5980.84 → 5981.96] not gonna I don't
[5981.96 → 5983.84] support that model it's
[5983.84 → 5985.12] a don't like that
[5985.12 → 5986.10] model free to play is
[5986.10 → 5987.12] getting kind of gross
[5987.12 → 5988.24] lately though dedicated
[5988.24 → 5990.92] servers dedicated servers
[5990.92 → 5992.82] are what I want and no
[5992.82 → 5993.94] I don't I don't I don't
[5993.94 → 5994.72] think free to play is
[5994.72 → 5995.68] necessarily the right
[5995.68 → 5996.60] way to go either because
[5996.60 → 5998.26] there's a lot of pay to
[5998.26 → 5999.40] win and there's a lot of
[5999.40 → 6000.84] what I think it was
[6000.84 → 6001.84] Logan that was talking
[6001.84 → 6002.80] about just sort of the
[6002.80 → 6004.20] general level of
[6004.20 → 6006.34] trolling stupidity that
[6006.34 → 6007.84] goes on with free
[6007.84 → 6009.12] to play no barrier of
[6009.12 → 6010.06] entry I think it's not
[6010.06 → 6011.08] necessarily great either
[6011.08 → 6015.56] but yeah anyway so I mean
[6015.56 → 6017.90] I'm imagining paying for
[6017.90 → 6018.80] an Xbox Live Gold
[6018.80 → 6019.62] membership to me, it's
[6019.62 → 6020.86] like if you guys all just
[6020.86 → 6022.38] refused to pay for it is
[6022.38 → 6023.60] would go away it would be
[6023.60 → 6025.20] free they do need people
[6025.20 → 6026.16] to buy the consoles and
[6026.16 → 6027.12] they do need people to buy
[6027.12 → 6028.54] the games but everyone
[6028.54 → 6029.36] just kind of keeps doing
[6029.36 → 6030.38] it is sorry go ahead I'm just
[6030.38 → 6031.94] at the same time Sony had
[6031.94 → 6033.98] it free who didn't like it
[6033.98 → 6035.60] so to bolster up the
[6035.60 → 6037.10] service they had to make
[6037.10 → 6038.30] it paid so they could fund
[6038.30 → 6039.40] it more had to is an
[6039.40 → 6040.70] awfully strong way of
[6040.70 → 6041.22] putting it had to keep
[6041.22 → 6042.58] shareholders happy and if
[6042.58 → 6043.48] they didn't have their company
[6043.48 → 6045.78] could close when you're
[6045.78 → 6046.68] publicly traded company
[6046.68 → 6047.54] you have to do certain
[6047.54 → 6050.30] things okay fine and
[6050.30 → 6051.76] as now this is just
[6051.76 → 6052.60] something that I scraped
[6052.60 → 6053.30] up right before the
[6053.30 → 6054.38] stream started so please
[6054.38 → 6055.38] correct me if I'm wrong in
[6055.38 → 6056.40] the comments but as far as
[6056.40 → 6058.04] I know you can record but
[6058.04 → 6059.34] not necessarily upload
[6059.34 → 6060.48] through the PlayStation if
[6060.48 → 6061.44] you don't have PlayStation
[6061.44 → 6062.62] plus or whatever it's
[6062.62 → 6065.52] called okay, but it makes a
[6065.52 → 6066.24] ton of sense that you
[6066.24 → 6067.20] could just take that file
[6067.20 → 6067.96] and upload it off your
[6067.96 → 6069.68] computer oh wait no it
[6069.68 → 6070.60] says right here Sony's
[6070.60 → 6071.24] share feature for
[6071.24 → 6072.14] PlayStation 4 allows
[6072.14 → 6073.12] users to record and
[6073.12 → 6074.50] upload up to 15 minutes
[6074.50 → 6075.28] of footage and is not
[6075.28 → 6076.10] restricted to PlayStation
[6076.10 → 6077.40] plus users record and
[6077.40 → 6078.40] upload okay yeah so
[6078.40 → 6080.54] Microsoft it says allows
[6080.54 → 6081.76] gold members to record up
[6081.76 → 6082.96] to five minutes of in-game
[6082.96 → 6084.00] footage for editing and
[6084.00 → 6085.20] upload to the Xbox Live
[6085.20 → 6086.06] service that's that's the
[6086.06 → 6086.98] thing too they can
[6086.98 → 6088.00] apparently edit it on the
[6088.00 → 6090.00] Xbox I don't think you
[6090.00 → 6090.76] can edit it why would you
[6090.76 → 6091.74] want us why would you
[6091.74 → 6093.42] what who records a
[6093.42 → 6094.54] five-minute recording and
[6094.54 → 6095.30] then edits it on their
[6095.30 → 6097.26] Xbox I mean this is how
[6097.26 → 6098.98] out of touch Microsoft is
[6098.98 → 6100.48] yep I agree I saw that and
[6100.48 → 6101.54] I was like oh cool you
[6101.54 → 6103.30] can edit it terribly like
[6103.30 → 6105.58] it's just going to suck all
[6105.58 → 6106.28] you're going to be doing is
[6106.28 → 6107.32] cutting it, and it won't be
[6107.32 → 6108.08] that great I mean looking
[6108.08 → 6109.08] at how much worse they
[6109.08 → 6109.98] managed to make Windows
[6109.98 → 6111.22] Live Movie Maker than the
[6111.22 → 6112.22] original Windows Movie
[6112.22 → 6113.32] Maker the original
[6113.32 → 6114.42] Windows Movie Maker as far
[6114.42 → 6115.58] as I have been told wasn't
[6115.58 → 6116.84] even that bad no it wasn't
[6116.84 → 6118.32] that bad yeah Windows Live
[6118.32 → 6119.16] Movie Maker isn't even
[6119.16 → 6120.34] that bad, but it isn't as
[6120.34 → 6121.26] good as the old one yeah
[6121.26 → 6125.60] yeah so anyway we should
[6125.60 → 6126.38] all just go back to that
[6126.38 → 6127.66] awesome game 3D Movie
[6127.66 → 6129.32] Maker that thing was
[6129.32 → 6130.38] awesome you're too you're
[6130.38 → 6131.28] too young for that game
[6131.28 → 6132.44] but it was oh man it was
[6132.44 → 6134.22] awesome I wasn't actually
[6134.22 → 6135.62] I can't believe it's five
[6135.62 → 6136.72] minutes anyway I still
[6136.72 → 6137.52] don't think this is gonna
[6137.52 → 6138.92] prevent you from capturing
[6138.92 → 6140.30] via HDMI using something
[6140.30 → 6141.60] like an AVer MeV Live
[6141.60 → 6143.12] Gamer portable or something
[6143.12 → 6144.88] like that my understanding
[6144.88 → 6147.22] is Microsoft hasn't said
[6147.22 → 6148.20] that they're going to be
[6148.20 → 6150.20] enabling HTCP whereas I
[6150.20 → 6151.36] believe Sony is still
[6151.36 → 6152.98] holding to the HTCP
[6152.98 → 6154.70] enabled outputs on PS4 just
[6154.70 → 6156.18] like they did with PS3 so
[6156.18 → 6157.24] it's not like Sony is
[6157.24 → 6158.68] perfect in all of this by
[6158.68 → 6159.66] any stretch of the
[6159.66 → 6162.20] imagination all right
[6162.20 → 6164.66] right now to build logs
[6164.66 → 6166.30] we have a few more topics
[6166.30 → 6167.22] yeah we do kind of have a
[6167.22 → 6168.74] few more CBS blocks online
[6168.74 → 6169.86] subscribers from watching
[6169.86 → 6171.56] their content if they use
[6171.56 → 6173.76] Time Warner this is like
[6173.76 → 6177.14] totally not okay nope to put
[6177.14 → 6178.56] it in sort of the most this
[6178.56 → 6179.82] is posted on the forum by
[6179.82 → 6184.02] each on though holy crap in
[6184.02 → 6185.68] response to Time Warner cutting
[6185.68 → 6187.22] off access to CBS in a few
[6187.22 → 6188.68] major markets today CBS has
[6188.68 → 6190.16] retaliated against Time Warner
[6190.16 → 6191.76] internet subscribers by
[6191.76 → 6193.26] blocking access to popular
[6193.26 → 6194.80] CBS shows currently available
[6194.80 → 6198.40] to watch on CBS.com this
[6198.40 → 6201.26] friends is an abuse of power and
[6201.26 → 6203.44] is nothing to do with the way
[6203.44 → 6204.60] that the internet should be
[6204.60 → 6206.90] working internet service for I
[6206.90 → 6208.24] mean we're not even talking
[6208.24 → 6210.54] traffic shaping any more we're
[6210.54 → 6212.74] talking about outright that's my
[6212.74 → 6214.84] competitor and I want people who
[6214.84 → 6216.48] support my competitor to be
[6216.48 → 6218.98] punished your customers
[6218.98 → 6221.52] or anyone else's customers
[6221.52 → 6225.48] punishing the customer is it I'm
[6225.48 → 6229.56] just mad basically screwing over
[6229.56 → 6230.50] your customer in any way screwing
[6230.50 → 6231.88] over anyone in any way should not be
[6231.88 → 6232.96] allowed and this is directly
[6232.96 → 6233.90] screwing over someone that is
[6233.90 → 6236.96] feeding you money it's not okay and
[6236.96 → 6239.96] this Time Warner representatives
[6239.96 → 6242.30] are calling it CBS's move is an
[6242.30 → 6243.50] abuse of power specifically
[6243.50 → 6245.40] stating CBS has shown an utter lack
[6245.40 → 6247.00] of regard for consumers by
[6247.00 → 6248.20] blocking Time Warner cables
[6248.20 → 6250.20] customers including our high-speed
[6250.20 → 6252.84] data only customers so not even a
[6252.84 → 6255.44] cable TV competitor from accessing
[6255.44 → 6257.38] the shows on their free website
[6257.38 → 6259.72] CPS enjoys the privilege of using
[6259.72 → 6261.44] public owned air waves to deliver
[6261.44 → 6262.56] their programming they should not be
[6262.56 → 6266.18] allowed to abuse that privilege it's
[6266.18 → 6269.46] getting real you all everything with
[6269.46 → 6271.08] different ISPs is getting nuts right
[6271.08 → 6273.32] now I hope that they know I
[6273.32 → 6276.60] almost hope that they abuse it that
[6276.60 → 6278.94] they abuse their power as much as they
[6278.94 → 6280.64] possibly can get away with they get
[6280.64 → 6282.68] crushed so that they get crushed so
[6282.68 → 6283.84] that there isn't so that the
[6283.84 → 6287.32] government can't just kind of you know
[6287.32 → 6290.42] be like well it's not that bad, yet we're
[6290.42 → 6293.74] just good just crushing you know what I
[6293.74 → 6297.02] hope that it gets to the point where a
[6297.02 → 6299.32] third of the subscribers in the US
[6299.32 → 6301.24] can't access a third of the other
[6301.24 → 6304.12] websites because it's not being served
[6304.12 → 6306.50] over someone's pipe or someone's butt hurt
[6306.50 → 6309.52] because someone else's hub is you know
[6309.52 → 6311.02] has bandwidth being using I hope that
[6311.02 → 6313.42] they get that petty about it so that
[6313.42 → 6316.30] this all just goes away that is what I
[6316.30 → 6318.10] hope because otherwise I don't think
[6318.10 → 6323.68] it'll go away no probably not all right
[6323.68 → 6325.34] why don't we call that it let's do
[6325.34 → 6326.60] build logs of the week which
[6326.60 → 6328.60] conveniently I already have downloaded
[6328.60 → 6332.08] because we've already done this, so I'm
[6332.08 → 6334.38] just going to have to find the download and
[6334.38 → 6337.38] we are starting with the awkward
[6337.38 → 6343.30] dreamer boom beautiful just like last
[6343.30 → 6347.44] time I'm just going to say it's kind of
[6347.44 → 6349.30] weird doing this again because usually
[6349.30 → 6351.52] it's its it's first usually fairly
[6351.52 → 6354.10] first impressions for you yeah and I
[6354.10 → 6356.58] haven't seen my PowerPoint other than
[6356.58 → 6357.94] just stretching the image and going for
[6357.94 → 6361.78] gold so it looks very nice
[6361.78 → 6363.70] one thing that you brought up the first
[6363.70 → 6366.22] time he's got four fans going in some
[6366.22 → 6368.62] crazy awesome wind tunnel yeah yeah the
[6368.62 → 6371.44] four fans here it's like fan one fan two
[6371.44 → 6373.48] fan three fans four, and it's just like
[6373.48 → 6375.70] whoosh all the air, but it shouldn't be
[6375.70 → 6377.38] loud because those are fan text fans
[6377.38 → 6379.24] those are quite nice fans he's got he's
[6379.24 → 6381.10] got white LED strips going all
[6381.10 → 6382.24] the way around the outside of his case
[6382.24 → 6384.46] which look great gorgeous, and he has
[6384.46 → 6386.86] awesome sleeving on everything
[6386.86 → 6389.02] and a lot of nice custom spray-painting
[6389.02 → 6391.62] painted graphics card shrouds painted
[6391.62 → 6394.96] SLA or crossfire bridge rather you had
[6394.96 → 6396.94] brought up the first time around that it
[6396.94 → 6398.32] was supposed to originally be a water
[6398.32 → 6400.30] cooled but it kind of looks like it's
[6400.30 → 6401.80] underwater anyway that's a nice night
[6401.80 → 6404.38] shot yep it's its hard to get nice
[6404.38 → 6406.24] night shots, but it looks great
[6406.24 → 6407.50] there he did a really, really good job
[6407.50 → 6410.44] with this system all right speaking of
[6410.44 → 6413.02] nights this one's nuts these photos that
[6413.02 → 6415.06] we have here been in his basically it
[6415.06 → 6416.20] looks kind of like a pamphlet
[6416.20 → 6417.88] advertisement at the end these are not
[6417.88 → 6420.22] his build log in progress photos I
[6420.22 → 6422.06] highly suggest that you check out all the
[6422.06 → 6424.06] builds on the build log there is so much
[6424.06 → 6426.22] back sweat going into this pillow at this
[6426.22 → 6427.96] point that I think it's almost soaked all
[6427.96 → 6432.04] the way through it smells awful like
[6432.04 → 6435.04] here I don't want to smell it I don't
[6435.04 → 6436.84] want to smell it I want to talk about a
[6436.84 → 6443.38] Dragon Knight PC jeez wow okay Paul Tan has
[6443.38 → 6445.48] been on build logs the week before he
[6445.48 → 6447.94] makes awesome incredible computers I
[6447.94 → 6449.50] wouldn't be surprised at all if he's
[6449.50 → 6450.46] selling this
[6450.46 → 6454.54] we can say he's the Paul Tan of
[6454.54 → 6457.54] computer builders oh my goodness let me
[6457.54 → 6460.34] just go ahead and open that up wow just
[6460.34 → 6461.80] like last time it's amazing
[6461.80 → 6465.70] it's not it's a cosmos to the front is
[6465.70 → 6467.74] gorgeous the sides got a window that's
[6467.74 → 6470.42] gorgeous and custom and holy crap it
[6470.42 → 6473.02] gets better than that my problem with the
[6473.02 → 6474.58] cosmos 2 is that it's big for no
[6474.58 → 6476.62] apparent reason you can't actually put
[6476.62 → 6478.06] that much stuff in it, but it looks like
[6478.06 → 6480.40] he basically gutted it so but one thing
[6480.40 → 6481.60] that he's done if you notice right away
[6481.60 → 6482.80] is there's no I'll come out of the
[6482.80 → 6484.06] back of the case the back of the cases
[6484.06 → 6486.30] on the right-hand picture so what
[6486.30 → 6488.00] he's done is rotated the motherboard 90
[6488.00 → 6490.24] degrees and custom formed the computer
[6490.24 → 6492.46] to work well with that so he's made an
[6492.46 → 6495.52] exhaust area on the back which can't see
[6495.52 → 6497.08] a ton of details on there, but it has
[6497.08 → 6499.18] individual slanting down fins it's a
[6499.18 → 6500.38] dark night how much were you expecting
[6500.38 → 6500.68] to see
[6500.68 → 6506.08] oh my god hey oh, oh why are you trolling
[6506.08 → 6508.56] Paul's system um because I love it so
[6508.56 → 6510.22] hard that's I guess that's not a bad
[6510.22 → 6513.02] not a bad point yeah it could be worse um
[6513.02 → 6517.36] yeah so he's done a ton of custom work for it if you want to see his like
[6517.36 → 6520.36] artist rendering prototype designs before he
[6520.36 → 6523.18] started building and his whole huge amount of
[6523.18 → 6526.00] pictures build log please check it out on the forum yeah check out the build log
[6526.00 → 6533.00] section of the build logs forum build logs of the week section
[6533.00 → 6534.00] haha
[6534.00 → 6538.48] haha okay so um this system has actually been
[6538.48 → 6540.60] done for a while I just have not been able to get
[6540.60 → 6544.60] way to put it in the actual freaking build log section so he finally did so
[6544.60 → 6547.48] we're finally showcasing it this isn't necessarily something that's kind of
[6547.48 → 6551.32] along the lines of what we usually put on here gaming rigs yeah not for
[6551.32 → 6559.32] gaming although with six PCI Express slots 32 opt-or on course and looks like up to
[6559.32 → 6566.12] whatever eight by sixteen would be so eight times ten is eighty and another five is
[6566.12 → 6569.88] forty so that's a hundred probably what a hundred and fifty-six gigs of memory or
[6569.88 → 6575.32] something stupid like that yeah, but that sounds about right yeah potentially so as
[6575.32 → 6580.04] as long as the board actually supports it um like my SSD in my laptop isn't that big
[6580.04 → 6588.52] and we're talking ram i wonder if that board supports it um yeah so click next
[6588.52 → 6591.80] should, might should even support more than that because if you throw some registered dims in there
[6591.80 → 6599.32] i think there are 16 gig registered dims sexy that'd be cool dim heat sinks that ram
[6599.32 → 6609.40] yep that custom rack i was just that rack wow um so he commissioned this rack it's you can
[6609.40 → 6613.56] get custom designed racks from i don't remember the guy's name i learned there are plastic surgeons
[6613.56 → 6620.68] that do that this guy does it with aluminum custom designed racks that is some space
[6620.68 → 6628.36] sagged stuff you got going on there rack armour maybe that explains chicks in video games right
[6629.24 → 6635.80] that's why their boobs are so big because they're armoured they right because they's for leading on
[6635.80 → 6642.60] the inside because they padded the bra because they have poor self-esteem then they had to wear armour
[6642.60 → 6649.88] and then there's clothing over top solve that mystery
[6654.36 → 6661.16] what now ESB anyway sorry we've done this a lot
[6663.96 → 6668.44] had to make it interesting somehow this is a freaking awesome build and I'm super stoked that way they did it
[6668.44 → 6673.24] and this is purely for folding as far as i know i don't think he does anything with this system other
[6673.24 → 6681.64] than fold, and it gets some like monstrous number of i think it's 350 000 PPI or ppd i think it's
[6681.64 → 6685.88] something ridiculous i mean whaler's far and away the uh biggest contributor to the Linus tech tips
[6685.88 → 6692.44] forearm folding team dude you're awesome and i think that pretty much wraps it up for the wan show this
[6692.44 → 6698.20] week thank you for tuning in or i don't know it's not live anymore, so thanks for watching the
[6698.20 → 6705.96] archive thanks for watching the archive to peace bye hopefully it worked this time yeah i know right
