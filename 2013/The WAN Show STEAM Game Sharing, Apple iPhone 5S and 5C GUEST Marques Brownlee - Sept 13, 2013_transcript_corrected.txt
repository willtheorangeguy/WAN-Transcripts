[0.00 → 8.58] All right guys, welcome to the WAN Show. It's September 13th, Friday the 13th, which is the luckiest day ever.
[9.00 → 17.06] If you're you guys, because you get to sit and watch us, as well as our special guest Marcus Brownlee,
[17.24 → 23.28] the one and only guru of all things Android, and actually a lot of other stuff as well.
[23.28 → 27.80] So I'm really excited to have him on the show by popular demand.
[27.80 → 30.80] I mean, when we started taking guest requests...
[30.80 → 33.42] One of the first and a lot of requests.
[33.58 → 34.64] And a lot of the other ones.
[34.82 → 35.46] Yeah, yeah.
[35.98 → 38.36] Pretty much all of them were Marcus Brownlee.
[38.44 → 41.80] We've also got a really exciting show for you guys this week.
[42.22 → 44.56] It's even more than usual.
[44.70 → 47.94] There has been a ton of stuff going on in tech.
[48.32 → 53.08] One of my favourite ones, at least, is the Steam announces family and friends sharing.
[53.08 → 57.28] So basically, I guess I shouldn't go into it, but Steam announces family and friends sharing,
[57.28 → 57.84] which is fantastic.
[57.84 → 58.54] Share your games!
[58.90 → 61.36] Kind of like we used to, back when there was a cartridge.
[61.66 → 66.76] Even in their call-out, they're like, you can do it with other mediums, so why can't you do it with this?
[66.82 → 67.88] So we're going to support it now.
[68.02 → 68.32] Wicked.
[69.14 → 70.40] And they're... yeah, anyway.
[70.66 → 76.18] Of course, there's Apple's Town Hall event, where they announced the iPhone 5S and the 5C.
[76.18 → 86.84] So that is the iPhone 5 See and the iPhone 5 Fantastic, depending on what you think of sort of the use of metal versus plastic materials.
[87.22 → 89.74] I actually already pre-ordered an iPhone 5C.
[90.20 → 91.54] You, I don't think, know this yet.
[91.56 → 92.36] I saw that, actually.
[92.44 → 92.74] You did?
[92.84 → 93.00] Okay.
[93.08 → 93.88] You saw that tweet.
[93.88 → 98.76] Not because I think I'm necessarily going to switch to it, but because I want to try it.
[98.80 → 99.64] I want to have the experience.
[99.74 → 100.92] I want to do an unboxing of it.
[101.26 → 102.94] So more on that with our guest.
[103.56 → 107.38] Comcast and Verizon have been very much caught.
[107.88 → 112.80] Maybe not necessarily throttling Netflix, but certainly not going out of their way.
[112.80 → 121.04] In fact, it feels like going out of their way not to provide the best service possible with certain video streaming services, such as Netflix.
[121.04 → 127.56] And, like, Netflix is trying as hard as they can to give them free stuff to help it be faster.
[127.78 → 129.04] Okay, more on that later.
[129.26 → 130.38] We're doing the topic call-outs.
[131.16 → 134.84] GTA 5 cost a metric butt-ton to make.
[135.22 → 141.88] It actually cost more than every other video game ever and almost every other movie ever.
[142.94 → 143.54] Wow.
[144.02 → 145.04] So without further ado...
[146.56 → 148.04] Really?
[148.38 → 148.70] Really?
[148.70 → 148.78] Really?
[149.20 → 149.70] I did...
[149.70 → 151.70] See, there's always something.
[152.24 → 155.78] Start when the scene loads and don't remember playback position.
[155.90 → 156.28] See, there.
[156.36 → 156.48] There.
[156.56 → 157.60] That's that problem.
[158.38 → 158.58] Nope.
[158.92 → 159.06] Nope.
[159.32 → 162.24] Apparently that's not the problem.
[163.04 → 167.64] So without further ado, our intro, which will happen at some point.
[167.88 → 169.02] Ah, when finished, rewind.
[169.02 → 175.78] Because it now hasn't finished, so it doesn't know to rewind.
[175.78 → 176.88] You're going to have to...
[176.88 → 177.84] Yeah, there you go.
[178.42 → 179.10] That's weird.
[179.24 → 180.24] That's not playing.
[180.76 → 182.78] Which is very interesting.
[182.78 → 184.34] No one can see what you're doing, which makes it better.
[184.90 → 190.80] He's actually, like, trying to fix it actively, and every time he tries, it just, like, flashes a lower third and then does nothing.
[190.80 → 192.98] Which is kind of fantastic.
[194.42 → 195.88] So here's what we'll do.
[196.82 → 197.86] Wait, is that even playing?
[198.18 → 198.70] Uh...
[199.70 → 201.08] Is there no audio?
[201.52 → 202.86] Oh, I love this show.
[202.98 → 204.18] This is, like, the best show ever.
[204.28 → 206.86] Okay, do you want to jump into one of our topics while I figure this out?
[206.86 → 207.98] So, drop...
[207.98 → 213.56] So people freaked out thinking that Dropbox was reading their documents because, um, there's a form of document.
[213.68 → 215.72] I can't remember exactly what it's called, but it's, like, a honeypot.
[216.00 → 222.12] So the idea is, if it's open, it'll call home and tell the person that made the document that it was opened.
[222.62 → 223.58] So this was, uh, hold on.
[223.62 → 223.74] Sorry.
[223.82 → 228.36] This was posted on the forum by James AJ, and the original article was at Daily Dot.
[228.46 → 230.46] So, guys, you can, you can check that out there.
[231.04 → 231.30] Yeah.
[231.30 → 236.84] So basically, uh, a user uploaded a bunch of these different types of files, and one of them was a doc.
[236.90 → 237.96] At least one of them was a doc.
[238.18 → 243.42] And the doc called home, and he basically demanded to know why it was opened.
[243.54 → 248.00] Because all this stuff going around with the NSA and everything else, people were kind of worried.
[248.00 → 250.56] Is, is Dropbox reading all of our documents?
[250.70 → 257.42] So Dropbox responded by saying, no, it's, it's being read to generate the preview for the website.
[257.58 → 260.90] If you go to Dropbox's website viewer, you can preview your files.
[260.90 → 264.58] So they do actually have to be able to open it so they can generate these previews.
[264.94 → 267.10] So a bunch of people freaked out.
[267.20 → 271.66] But if you heard about this and freaked out, here's a nice little update that we can add.
[271.72 → 275.76] Most of these things that have been tricking out, trickling out lately are all negative.
[275.76 → 280.62] And this one turned out to at least highly probably not be that negative.
[280.62 → 284.74] Because if they're just generating a preview file, it's not that big of a deal.
[285.80 → 288.82] How's our, how's our, how's our preview file coming?
[289.06 → 290.60] Our preview file is amazing.
[291.64 → 295.64] It's, it seems to be like a, like a broken file or something.
[295.90 → 300.40] So, um, yeah, I think it's time to do the next topic here.
[300.58 → 300.82] All right.
[300.86 → 304.98] So we're jumping into my favourite topic of the week, which is Steam family sharing, which
[304.98 → 307.00] is actually not only family sharing.
[307.00 → 310.16] You're able to share it with quote unquote close friends as well.
[310.22 → 313.82] I think they're suggesting you only do it with close friends because how it works is you
[313.82 → 315.78] add a computer to your allowed list.
[315.78 → 321.60] So this reminded me a lot of the two-step that Steam currently has where you're adding computers
[321.60 → 323.26] to your Steam's allowed list.
[323.52 → 323.74] Yeah.
[323.88 → 328.10] So I kind of think what's happening here is they're using the same type of system, and you're
[328.10 → 330.36] allowing friends to access your games that way as well.
[330.36 → 333.84] Friends will be, have their own achievement lists and their own save files for the games,
[333.96 → 334.40] which is awesome.
[334.40 → 338.02] Which is really cool because there's nothing that really prevented you from sharing a Steam
[338.02 → 343.16] account before other than, well, if they have your password, then they would be able to
[343.16 → 345.86] potentially, you know, change your password or whatever else.
[346.00 → 350.92] But now being able to actually separate even things like Steam cloud settings.
[351.04 → 354.60] Steam cloud settings, achievements, save files, everything.
[354.86 → 355.90] It's freaking awesome.
[356.08 → 357.50] Like so stoked on this.
[357.50 → 358.64] That is so cool.
[358.64 → 364.88] I mean, the thing to me about this is that it was a long time coming in my mind.
[365.10 → 372.14] I mean, Steam and Valve, they, it feels like they were just kind of waiting for the right
[372.14 → 376.10] moment because there's no reason with a digital distribution platform that they couldn't have
[376.10 → 377.96] turned this on at any time.
[377.96 → 382.42] But it's almost like they were waiting for someone else to do something Draconian and stupid
[382.42 → 388.36] like what Microsoft was trying to do over the last little while with the Xbox One and
[388.36 → 390.70] then just kind of dump on them.
[391.18 → 391.48] Why not?
[391.72 → 392.38] It makes sense.
[392.64 → 397.12] And a lot of the defence of Microsoft's approach with, well, their initial approach with the
[397.12 → 400.36] Xbox One was, oh, well, it's not that different from what Steam does.
[401.56 → 402.40] Not anymore.
[402.90 → 406.42] Oh, no, you did it because now it's completely different.
[406.82 → 411.04] Steam is allowing games to be shared in a way that really discs can't even be shared.
[411.04 → 414.28] No, because you can, like, I could share this with my friend in Minnesota.
[414.98 → 417.06] Like, it's not really a big deal.
[417.24 → 424.10] Like, you would actually have to physically mail discs to each other to make Xbox or PS3
[424.10 → 429.18] or PS whatever we're on now a somewhat competitive platform compared to what this is doing.
[429.30 → 430.30] It's absolutely outstanding.
[430.60 → 430.98] It's interesting.
[431.14 → 436.76] What I'm really interested in is due to the account sharing idea, are you going to have
[436.76 → 439.12] to, like, pseudo log into their account?
[439.12 → 440.58] Or what's actually going to happen?
[440.64 → 442.98] Because if you could both run the same game at the same time...
[443.54 → 446.44] That I can't imagine they would allow us to do.
[446.52 → 448.94] I know, but some games support local co-op.
[448.96 → 453.34] So I'm wondering if the games that support local co-op would allow you to play that way.
[454.28 → 454.54] I don't know.
[454.54 → 456.04] Because that would be really cool.
[456.04 → 459.62] My guess would be that it would be somewhat dependent on the game developer themselves.
[459.76 → 465.00] Because you look at, like, what EA did with Origin, where they're allowing refunds after
[465.00 → 465.94] whatever it is.
[465.98 → 468.74] The first launch within 24 hours or after seven days.
[469.30 → 472.04] And they're only offering that on EA games.
[472.04 → 478.98] So Valve probably doesn't have the, well, the might to just kind of go, oh, well, if your
[478.98 → 483.30] game supports local co-op, then yeah, you know, multiple people can play it at the same
[483.30 → 483.66] time.
[483.80 → 489.86] It also doesn't really give too much clarification in terms of what these, I guess I'll call them
[489.86 → 490.34] spawn.
[491.34 → 491.82] Yeah.
[491.98 → 493.02] Spawn Steam accounts.
[493.68 → 494.76] Old reference, guys.
[494.76 → 501.32] What kind of rights they have in terms of, because they say family and close friends.
[501.88 → 502.72] Does that mean...
[502.72 → 504.04] It's actually fairly vague right now.
[504.22 → 507.68] Does that mean someone that you would trust with your password and trust with the ability
[507.68 → 509.58] to change your settings?
[509.78 → 510.00] Yeah.
[510.00 → 511.86] Or what does that mean?
[512.06 → 512.76] I don't quite know.
[513.00 → 513.94] I have no idea.
[514.10 → 515.24] It really begs the question.
[515.56 → 516.56] That's a false statement.
[516.70 → 517.16] But anyway.
[518.50 → 524.74] It pleads the question and acquiesces the question and suggests the question.
[524.76 → 526.54] And eats the question.
[528.78 → 534.66] For those of you who are just sort of wondering what I'm talking about, begs the question is
[534.66 → 535.72] not technically correct.
[536.10 → 542.00] And Diesel, or Easel, as he's going by these days, is a bit of a grammar Nazi.
[543.06 → 545.18] Diva, actually, is probably a better word.
[545.54 → 550.62] The correct way to say what people are trying to say is it raises the question.
[550.96 → 554.58] Not any other verb that doesn't do those other things.
[554.76 → 555.16] So...
[555.16 → 555.38] Yeah.
[556.54 → 557.40] Does that say verb?
[557.74 → 558.04] Yeah.
[558.18 → 559.50] Because I don't even remember.
[559.86 → 560.12] Yeah.
[560.32 → 561.18] What are actions?
[562.42 → 562.94] Verb, I think.
[563.02 → 563.56] Yeah, that's verb.
[563.68 → 563.84] Yeah.
[563.84 → 564.28] I was right.
[565.04 → 565.48] Yay!
[565.54 → 565.98] Anyway.
[565.98 → 566.66] Anyway.
[567.26 → 572.08] So since our intro is clearly not working here, I would like to introduce the sponsors of
[572.08 → 572.82] the show today.
[573.18 → 574.62] So Hotspot Shield, guys.
[574.76 → 579.92] Hotspot Shield is one of the most popular VPN solutions out there.
[580.20 → 583.54] They've got solutions for mobile platforms as well as desktops.
[583.54 → 589.28] It's relatively inexpensive, and it allows you to do things like get around pesky region restrictions
[589.28 → 590.88] for things like Netflix.
[591.18 → 596.64] It allows you to maintain your anonymity slightly more, although the NSA is certainly going to
[596.64 → 600.82] work awfully hard on, you know, circumventing whatever else you can do.
[600.82 → 606.78] And it's 20% off the elite prices if you use code Linus.
[606.92 → 609.82] And our second sponsor of the show today is Squarespace.
[610.12 → 615.20] So Squarespace is the easy way to create a beautiful website without any knowledge whatsoever
[615.20 → 616.76] of how to create a website.
[616.98 → 619.62] Even less complicated than something like WordPress.
[619.82 → 620.74] Do you think I could do it?
[621.66 → 622.22] Uh...
[622.22 → 624.16] I did it, so choose your words wisely.
[625.36 → 626.62] Be real careful.
[626.78 → 627.30] Did you actually?
[627.46 → 632.04] I created a dummy one, and then I actually managed to kind of screw it up.
[632.54 → 635.20] Because when you select Squarespace...
[635.20 → 639.52] Okay, so when you set up Squarespace, you pick a template, you know, based on whether you
[639.52 → 641.28] want a store or a blog or whatever else.
[641.28 → 644.72] And I picked one that was totally inappropriate, because I just picked one at random.
[645.20 → 649.56] And then Diesel was like, you know, you can't actually revert to a different template
[649.56 → 652.50] once you commit to one, because they all have kind of, like, different stuff.
[652.66 → 654.72] And so we had to recreate the account and stuff.
[655.00 → 657.00] So I did manage to screw it up a little bit anyway.
[657.30 → 659.48] They have a special offer for the month of September.
[659.60 → 664.62] So if you visit Squarespace.com and use offer code Linus9, you can get 20% off.
[664.66 → 666.26] And, of course, free trials are free.
[666.78 → 669.16] So, without further ado, we've got...
[669.16 → 670.56] Let's do a Twitter blitz, guys.
[670.90 → 672.38] Hit us on Twitter at Linus Tech.
[672.38 → 673.56] That handle right there.
[673.98 → 678.68] And we'd love to hear maybe some preliminary warm-up questions for Marcus Brownlee.
[678.68 → 681.28] And we can move into our next topic here.
[682.58 → 686.86] So Yahoo's Marissa Mayer doesn't want to go to prison, evidently.
[687.04 → 688.72] This was an article on Daily Tech.
[688.88 → 695.82] And it actually ties into the whole NSA and data spying and who do you trust.
[696.00 → 697.22] We actually discussed...
[697.22 → 698.86] Man, this must have been a couple of months ago.
[699.34 → 705.28] Someone did an index of which companies give your data, which ones go to court about it,
[705.28 → 707.68] which ones eventually give up if there's a court order.
[707.68 → 712.34] And so, anyway, what she said is...
[712.34 → 717.36] And I want to get this quote right because if I don't quote it, then I don't want to be putting words in her mouth.
[718.20 → 722.08] If you don't comply, it is treason.
[722.90 → 725.90] We can't talk about it because it is classified.
[726.46 → 728.96] Releasing classified information is treason.
[729.28 → 730.30] And you are incarcerated.
[730.68 → 734.80] In terms of protecting our users, it makes more sense to work within the system.
[734.80 → 738.08] So to paraphrase, what she's saying is...
[738.08 → 739.46] We don't like it.
[739.46 → 740.46] We're going to fight it.
[740.46 → 741.46] We're going to fight it.
[741.46 → 749.00] But at the end of the day, if we are going to be committing treason by withholding information that is being demanded by the government,
[749.00 → 754.56] and we're all going to end up in jail anyway, then I guess we better just do it.
[754.56 → 759.04] Because if we're not here to protect your rights, then we won't be here at all.
[759.12 → 760.26] And they won't have any protection.
[760.26 → 762.84] To which I would kind of say bullshit.
[763.82 → 768.32] Now, the article on Daily Tech was actually pretty positive about it overall and kind of went,
[768.42 → 769.98] Oh, well, I guess their hands are tied.
[770.80 → 772.18] I don't agree at all.
[772.24 → 778.06] Because the reality of it is, if the CEO of every company that owns user data,
[778.34 → 783.80] whether it's an ISP or it's Apple or Google or Yahoo or Microsoft or any of these guys,
[783.80 → 789.24] if the US government just started putting all of their CEOs in jail...
[789.24 → 791.08] That would not go over very well.
[791.08 → 792.00] It wouldn't happen.
[792.40 → 793.48] We have to be realistic.
[793.72 → 796.60] The law is the law, but nobody's going to do that.
[796.72 → 797.86] That would be insane.
[798.60 → 799.96] Like, actually insane.
[800.04 → 801.06] It would be completely insane.
[801.20 → 807.84] How quickly would Apple pick up their headquarters and move and just be gone?
[809.12 → 813.24] What would that do to the US economy if Microsoft, Google and Apple...
[813.80 → 814.40] Yeah, seriously.
[814.40 → 815.04] ...just left?
[815.26 → 815.50] Yeah.
[815.90 → 819.32] So, you know what, Marissa, if you're watching, and I'm sure you are,
[822.44 → 824.44] could you call a bluff, maybe?
[825.46 → 826.94] And, I mean, here's another question.
[826.94 → 833.10] Is it really the CEO of a company's responsibility to have to call a bluff
[833.10 → 836.06] and potentially risk going to jail, or even if they didn't put them in jail,
[836.44 → 840.08] some other kind of punishment?
[840.56 → 841.22] What do you think?
[842.22 → 846.82] Their responsibility, yes, because who else are they going to put it on in the company to do that?
[846.92 → 847.22] Okay.
[847.34 → 848.02] At that point in time.
[848.46 → 850.96] How do you make an employee possibly go to jail?
[851.54 → 855.04] But, I mean, here's the thing, though, is Yahoo is a publicly held company.
[855.16 → 856.32] Marissa Mayer is an employee.
[856.32 → 856.62] What do you mean?
[856.62 → 862.50] Would it be the corporate entity or person, Yahoo, that should go to jail?
[862.96 → 863.92] And how do you do that?
[864.04 → 864.94] How do you enforce that?
[865.30 → 865.50] Yeah, yeah.
[865.76 → 866.48] That's interesting.
[866.62 → 867.42] I have no idea.
[867.58 → 872.60] But another thing that they could do is, like, she could call a meeting between a bunch
[872.60 → 876.36] of these big people that are possibly withholding information, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[876.36 → 878.16] and all do it at the same time.
[878.20 → 880.02] Because, like you were talking about, they're not going to put them all in jail.
[880.24 → 882.98] They're especially not going to put them all in jail all at the same time.
[884.22 → 887.96] One at once is a lot less scary than everyone.
[887.96 → 895.96] So, if everyone just kind of banded together and refused to do this, I just, I wonder if
[895.96 → 898.38] that kind of thing could possibly happen.
[898.68 → 900.90] I kind of doubt it a little bit.
[902.00 → 903.92] Yeah, I don't think it would happen at all.
[905.26 → 910.56] Speaking of totally evil stuff that's going on, let's move into our Comcast and Verizon.
[911.42 → 917.86] Now, okay, I apologize because this looks like a bit of an inflammatory title on the
[917.86 → 921.66] thread created by Echoed, but thank you very much for posting it anyway.
[922.22 → 928.04] Comcast and Verizon throttling YouTube and Netflix usage while RCN, which is a smaller
[928.04 → 931.12] Chicago-based ISP, is letting it flow.
[931.38 → 937.60] Now, it's more complicated than just throttling or not throttling because throttling would imply
[937.60 → 941.30] They're actually, like, specifically trying to slow it down.
[941.44 → 943.18] Yeah, like traffic shaping.
[943.34 → 945.46] They're saying, okay, this is faster, this is not faster.
[945.46 → 951.96] But what this actually looks like is almost an even more ominous type of anti-competitive
[951.96 → 956.08] behaviour where Netflix in particular, let's use them as the example.
[956.20 → 958.24] So, the original article here was from Ars Technica.
[958.44 → 959.64] Just go ahead and check that out.
[960.68 → 963.98] Because, okay, so Netflix, great example.
[964.08 → 968.72] For those of you who aren't familiar with Netflix, the way it works is the more bandwidth
[968.72 → 973.64] available to you, the better your connection to their server, the better the image quality.
[973.64 → 979.88] They actually scale it up and down dynamically according to how great your internet connection
[979.88 → 980.24] is.
[980.76 → 987.86] Okay, so Netflix is reaching out to ISPs and going, look, we know that the biggest challenge
[987.86 → 990.76] is the last mile, so to speak.
[990.94 → 993.82] So, directly from you to your individual customers.
[993.82 → 1000.24] What we want to do is we want to put our own caching servers right within your facilities
[1000.24 → 1005.48] so that it takes some of the load off the rest of your network infrastructure because
[1005.48 → 1006.74] they can just pull directly.
[1007.18 → 1010.62] Which is the greatest idea ever for both teams.
[1010.80 → 1014.54] Like, it costs Netflix money, but all their customers are happier.
[1014.90 → 1015.04] Yes.
[1015.12 → 1016.38] So, that's an investment.
[1016.50 → 1017.06] That's a good thing.
[1017.06 → 1019.18] And it's free for the ISP.
[1019.86 → 1019.98] Yes.
[1021.20 → 1023.06] So, basically...
[1024.74 → 1031.10] So, basically, they said no to the free hardware.
[1031.10 → 1037.22] Charter, Verizon, Comcast, Time Warner look like they have just kind of gone, no, we're
[1037.22 → 1037.82] not interested.
[1038.04 → 1040.04] RCN said, yes, we are.
[1040.34 → 1042.84] This is a regional chart as well.
[1042.84 → 1050.52] There's a USA-wide chart which shows Google Fibre at the top who has adopted this.
[1051.34 → 1056.08] And, what is it, Cable something, I can't remember the name of it, also at the top who
[1056.08 → 1057.22] has also adopted this.
[1057.64 → 1058.68] So, there you go, guys.
[1058.86 → 1064.82] Average speed in megabit per second, RCN is able to beat out Verizon and Comcast by over
[1064.82 → 1065.98] 10%.
[1065.98 → 1072.66] Actually, Comcast, yeah, by over 10%, which basically amounts to no matter what your ISP is advertising,
[1072.66 → 1077.50] to you, in terms of, you know, an up or a down speed or whatever else.
[1078.60 → 1083.94] Certain types of service actually just do put more load on their infrastructure and they
[1083.94 → 1086.38] will operate slower than advertised speeds.
[1086.80 → 1089.66] But, they have a solution.
[1090.08 → 1091.30] And they're just not taking it.
[1091.30 → 1091.88] Taking it.
[1092.26 → 1098.74] I love the way that Netflix is putting the pressure on the ISPs by creating their index
[1098.74 → 1104.34] of ISP speed ratings according to how well they operate with Netflix and making that information
[1104.34 → 1104.78] public.
[1104.78 → 1110.68] Because the anti-competitive part of this is that these service providers also happen
[1110.68 → 1115.10] to provide TV show service via cable.
[1115.10 → 1115.50] Yeah.
[1115.50 → 1123.54] So, the only incentive for them to not upgrade their internet service and allow users to
[1123.54 → 1131.04] get a better Netflix experience appears to be to make their television service more appealing
[1131.04 → 1131.62] than Netflix.
[1131.80 → 1136.38] Because even though they can't compete with On Demand, they can deliver much better image
[1136.38 → 1136.82] quality.
[1136.82 → 1137.82] Wow.
[1141.40 → 1146.40] And I'm really glad that there are ISPs that are doing this because it really blows this
[1146.40 → 1148.84] up and makes it very, very public.
[1149.38 → 1153.76] And the best part almost is when you go to the USA wide chart because then you see Google
[1153.76 → 1156.54] Fibre just crushing everyone.
[1157.26 → 1160.54] And Google Fibre has been like doing this for a long time.
[1160.64 → 1164.64] But on this chart, it's kind of ridiculous because Google Fibre comes in at 3.58.
[1164.64 → 1168.50] And then you go down to where does Fibre, Verizon finally show up.
[1168.54 → 1170.04] So, Google Fibre is at 3.58.
[1170.12 → 1171.22] Here, do you want to send this to me?
[1171.36 → 1171.58] Sure.
[1173.30 → 1175.34] ISPSpeedindex.netflix.com slash USA.
[1175.54 → 1177.22] So, I'm just going to, I'll just head over there manually.
[1177.22 → 1178.64] It's pretty, it's pretty short, actually.
[1178.90 → 1179.02] Okay.
[1179.06 → 1182.36] So, Google Fibre comes in at number one at 3.58.
[1182.90 → 1186.46] Verizon Fins finally comes in at 2.14.
[1187.20 → 1188.04] Here we go guys.
[1188.04 → 1189.06] I'll pull this up for you.
[1190.28 → 1190.68] Boom.
[1190.68 → 1194.64] Part of the thing when you're looking at this chart though is these are average speeds.
[1195.08 → 1198.76] So, Google Fibre is going to have a bunch of people that are going incredibly fast because
[1198.76 → 1199.44] it's Google Fibre.
[1199.60 → 1199.72] Yeah.
[1200.02 → 1206.70] But some of the smaller guys and some, I don't remember where it is, but certain ones will
[1206.70 → 1210.48] have people that are in more rural areas that don't have really fast speeds and that will
[1210.48 → 1211.04] bring them down.
[1211.28 → 1212.00] And that's true.
[1212.00 → 1215.82] I mean, we do have to, without just sort of saying, yes, all the ISPs are bad.
[1215.82 → 1220.70] I mean, they are all bad, but without just saying, oh, the ISPs are all bad, you got
[1220.70 → 1223.64] to actually investigate the numbers a little bit as well.
[1223.72 → 1227.62] I mean, I think it should be pretty obvious that if Google Fibre is available in your area,
[1228.18 → 1230.28] you should probably get it.
[1230.62 → 1230.78] Yeah.
[1231.30 → 1232.94] That should be pretty obvious.
[1233.52 → 1238.70] But with that said, at least you can use this Netflix index to figure out if the other
[1238.70 → 1239.56] ones are not that bad.
[1239.56 → 1244.20] And they're planning on releasing these more regional-based indexes as time goes on.
[1244.30 → 1247.88] So if one releases for your area, be sure to check it out and then pick accordingly.
[1248.80 → 1251.62] Or at least have it sway your decisions slightly.
[1251.92 → 1254.28] Because if you're a Netflix user, that could help quite a bit.
[1254.96 → 1255.40] All right.
[1255.46 → 1257.16] Our next topic here, guys.
[1257.62 → 1258.18] Oh, man.
[1258.26 → 1260.02] This is like, this is so awesome.
[1260.20 → 1260.28] So good.
[1260.46 → 1260.74] Okay.
[1260.82 → 1263.12] So this was posted on the forum by TopWarGamer.
[1263.60 → 1264.00] Go.
[1264.00 → 1269.28] Basically, for anyone that shares my incredible frustration of not being able to preload entire
[1269.28 → 1274.78] YouTube videos, there has been a fix, which I'm super stoked about because I will often
[1274.78 → 1276.78] scrub through videos and be like, oh, what was that?
[1277.06 → 1280.78] And then have to reload part of it, which is incredibly frustrating because I've already
[1280.78 → 1281.32] loaded it.
[1281.72 → 1283.74] And you know what really annoys me about this?
[1283.80 → 1286.20] By the way, the original article was posted on Life hacker.
[1286.96 → 1289.02] You know what really annoys me about this?
[1289.02 → 1294.68] Is when it halfway loads, and then you scrub to like three quarters through and all of
[1294.68 → 1296.52] that just moves out of the cache.
[1296.62 → 1298.24] And I'm sitting here going, what?
[1298.74 → 1299.14] Why?
[1299.72 → 1301.04] Please don't do that.
[1301.14 → 1302.60] Like, please don't do that.
[1303.26 → 1304.06] So anyway, sorry.
[1304.12 → 1304.42] Go ahead.
[1304.50 → 1306.36] So this is a simple browser plugin.
[1307.44 → 1307.66] Yeah.
[1307.74 → 1308.52] Simple browser plugin.
[1308.64 → 1309.76] You can get it on multiple platforms.
[1309.88 → 1314.18] And all you have to do is once you install it, go to YouTube, click the little cog thing
[1314.18 → 1317.48] and disable, I can't remember what it's called, but dash playback.
[1317.48 → 1322.68] So you just disable dash playback, which sounds like a good thing, but no.
[1323.32 → 1329.96] So, I mean, in their defence, while their dash adaptive streaming over HTTP, while that
[1329.96 → 1336.74] may be more efficient in most cases, it's not necessarily helpful if you're sitting, you
[1336.74 → 1340.08] know, on your laptop in your driveway connected to your Wi-Fi.
[1340.46 → 1341.70] I mean, who hasn't done that?
[1341.90 → 1345.48] And you kind of go, oh, I really want to listen to that song I don't have on my phone, or I
[1345.48 → 1348.76] really want to watch that show that I've been meaning to watch for a while.
[1349.08 → 1352.58] Being able to cache the whole thing so that when you move away, like, you know that moment
[1352.58 → 1356.00] when the car starts moving, you're just like, oh, I'm still in range.
[1356.08 → 1357.02] I can still watch it.
[1357.16 → 1357.34] Yeah.
[1357.42 → 1358.30] It's not over yet.
[1358.56 → 1358.80] Ah!
[1358.80 → 1364.00] I run into this, like, not even necessarily laptop, because I don't necessarily know that
[1364.00 → 1367.00] many people that have sat in their driveway on their laptop, but phones.
[1367.32 → 1368.84] As you're walking out of the house.
[1369.78 → 1372.64] Like, you watch something on your phone, you walk out of the house.
[1372.74 → 1375.12] As you're walking out of the house, you don't want it to lose everything.
[1375.74 → 1377.60] No, that's absolutely fantastic.
[1378.10 → 1380.08] So, we're four minutes away from our guest.
[1380.16 → 1382.76] Let's do that Twitter blitz that I promised to do.
[1383.16 → 1385.50] Apparently, we have 12 new tweets only?
[1385.66 → 1386.52] You've got to be kidding me.
[1386.52 → 1387.92] Oh, no, there we go, there we go.
[1388.52 → 1389.20] All right.
[1389.78 → 1392.94] Why are next-gen CPU clock speeds so slow?
[1393.08 → 1395.66] For example, the Xbox One, 1.65 gigahertz, really?
[1396.28 → 1401.82] Well, the cold hard truth is that the next-gen consoles are getting mobile processors.
[1402.50 → 1404.22] They're not getting desktop processors.
[1404.50 → 1407.54] They're really not even that powerful compared to previous-gen consoles.
[1407.68 → 1409.14] They're basically Uber tablets.
[1409.60 → 1415.54] Like, if you guys want my honest sort of, here, this is what you're buying for $500 or $400.
[1415.54 → 1417.72] You could also buy a tablet for that.
[1417.78 → 1422.20] And yes, Xbox One and PS4 will deliver better graphics than a current tablet.
[1422.38 → 1422.72] Of course.
[1422.76 → 1424.54] But one or two gens from now on tablets?
[1424.76 → 1425.10] Pfft.
[1425.86 → 1426.32] It's over.
[1427.10 → 1429.30] Nerds don't sleep at 1 a.m.
[1429.60 → 1430.04] Awesome.
[1431.04 → 1432.22] Slick hickey tips?
[1432.22 → 1435.08] Is that a hickey?
[1437.40 → 1438.40] I tried.
[1438.74 → 1439.72] I really tried.
[1439.92 → 1440.60] It didn't work.
[1440.74 → 1442.14] Twitch chat caught it, like, immediately.
[1443.04 → 1443.50] Wow.
[1444.08 → 1444.56] So.
[1445.52 → 1446.42] No story.
[1446.58 → 1447.02] Keep going.
[1447.44 → 1447.66] Twitter.
[1447.66 → 1447.92] Really?
[1450.00 → 1450.94] No story.
[1453.34 → 1454.22] All right, man.
[1454.22 → 1457.46] I tried.
[1458.42 → 1461.60] Someone asked, are NVIDIA cards worth it when AMD alternatives are cheaper?
[1461.74 → 1467.88] It really comes down to what you want, and the whole landscape is going to go like this,
[1468.00 → 1469.64] completely upside down in the next month.
[1469.70 → 1470.56] So stay tuned, guys.
[1472.26 → 1472.74] Wow.
[1472.90 → 1477.36] Half of the comments are on slick hickey tips and USB condoms.
[1477.76 → 1479.16] Was a USB condom involved?
[1479.58 → 1480.06] No.
[1480.06 → 1484.80] What do you think about phone blocks?
[1484.90 → 1488.94] That's actually going to be one of our topics with Marcus Brownlee, and we're real stoked
[1488.94 → 1489.76] to talk about that.
[1489.78 → 1491.32] Yeah, that'll be fascinating, actually.
[1492.40 → 1496.70] We aren't particularly going to cover the new Nexus phone, but we can ask Marcus to give
[1496.70 → 1497.46] his thoughts on it.
[1498.02 → 1499.68] Someone says, thanks for having Marcus on.
[1499.76 → 1502.60] Wow, like, half of the comments are about your neck.
[1503.28 → 1505.76] What's your opinion on the new AMD Apus?
[1505.76 → 1509.08] Do you think it can be a viable gaming computing platform for the near future?
[1509.08 → 1515.90] I guess trick question, because both Xbox One and PS4 are running AMD's Apus.
[1516.28 → 1517.92] It's a viable gaming platform.
[1518.66 → 1519.40] Believe you me.
[1520.30 → 1524.40] On a tight budget, A-series with a GTX 760, a crazy choice.
[1524.70 → 1528.36] I wouldn't buy an A-series unless I was using the onboard graphics.
[1529.50 → 1530.68] So, yeah.
[1530.68 → 1530.76] Yeah.
[1532.08 → 1534.42] How soon do you think the Nexus 5 is going to come out?
[1534.46 → 1536.06] Okay, so that'll be for Marcus.
[1536.58 → 1538.36] I hear you're going to buy an iPhone 5S.
[1538.50 → 1540.82] Do you trust Apple in keeping your fingerprint safe?
[1540.94 → 1542.48] What if the government demands it?
[1542.84 → 1546.84] If the government demands it, Apple will have no way of giving it to them, because the way
[1546.84 → 1551.12] that the fingerprint scanner works is it's actually encrypted and stored locally on the
[1551.12 → 1551.52] device.
[1551.80 → 1556.90] As much as Apple might be pushing iCloud, and Microsoft might be pushing Skydive, and
[1556.90 → 1562.02] Google's pushing their drive, and everyone's cloud this, cloud that, security is not necessarily
[1562.02 → 1563.12] a cloud-friendly thing.
[1563.20 → 1567.58] And Apple actually did a great thing here with their implementation of the fingerprint scanner.
[1567.68 → 1570.44] I know there's a lot of fearmongering going on.
[1570.78 → 1572.78] NSA this, fingerprints, not privacy.
[1572.78 → 1574.52] I mean, have you ever gone through an airport?
[1575.20 → 1578.76] I mean, actually, no, I don't think it was the airport where I got my fingerprint scanned.
[1578.88 → 1579.46] I don't think so.
[1579.74 → 1580.82] I've had it happen somewhere.
[1580.82 → 1581.96] I have multiple times.
[1581.96 → 1582.72] Yeah, I've had my fingerprints.
[1582.72 → 1583.66] The government has my fingerprints.
[1583.84 → 1585.80] Yeah, my fingerprints are scanned already.
[1585.88 → 1586.64] They've already got it.
[1586.80 → 1587.54] So there's that.
[1588.34 → 1592.18] We had a field trip in, like, grade 2, where everyone had to go get their fingerprints scanned.
[1592.32 → 1593.94] Like, mine's been scanned forever.
[1594.62 → 1594.86] Really?
[1595.00 → 1596.02] Okay, well, there you go.
[1596.28 → 1597.70] Okay, so there's that.
[1597.70 → 1601.36] There's the fact that your fingerprint probably isn't that big of a privacy thing anyway.
[1601.36 → 1607.58] But number two is the fact that it's stored, encrypted, only locally on the device.
[1607.98 → 1609.12] Apple can't access it.
[1609.46 → 1619.96] And unless you, like, rip the A7 chip out of someone else's iPhone, solder it into, like, another one or something somehow, like, figure out, like, a fingerprint.
[1620.18 → 1621.74] And it doesn't even store the fingerprint.
[1621.94 → 1626.54] It stores a hash, which is just a value that allows it to validate a fingerprint.
[1626.54 → 1634.00] So they would have to reconstruct the fingerprint from the hash that they pulled off the chip inside your phone.
[1634.00 → 1636.90] It's way too difficult, I think, is what he's trying to say.
[1637.18 → 1637.50] Yes.
[1638.14 → 1644.58] It's behind so many layers of ridiculous that there would be many other ways that they could get it that would be much easier.
[1645.04 → 1645.38] Yes.
[1645.76 → 1646.06] Okay.
[1646.46 → 1652.84] So, apparently we lost about 3,000 viewers because I'm saying that Apple's implementation might not be the worst thing ever.
[1652.84 → 1657.18] There's some bunch of transcoding issues and stuff going on with Twitch right now.
[1657.30 → 1658.64] Oh, come on, Twitch.
[1659.06 → 1659.32] Yeah.
[1659.58 → 1660.14] There's only one.
[1661.20 → 1667.54] So, Marcus, say hi to the WAN show and maybe tell them a little bit about yourself as if they haven't heard of you before.
[1667.94 → 1668.42] Yeah, hello.
[1668.54 → 1668.82] Awesome.
[1669.64 → 1670.08] Okay.
[1670.08 → 1673.42] So, I'm a YouTuber, just like you guys.
[1673.94 → 1677.48] And so my channel is YouTube.com slash MHD.
[1678.04 → 1679.98] And, yes, I see the chat.
[1680.06 → 1680.76] People already know.
[1681.20 → 1684.86] But, yeah, so I do videos on all kinds of consumer electronics, tech stuff.
[1685.18 → 1686.06] I explain stuff.
[1686.66 → 1688.12] I talk about stuff.
[1688.18 → 1689.00] I review stuff.
[1689.46 → 1691.60] And I also just talk about random things that are relevant.
[1691.72 → 1695.56] I do sometimes top five videos talking about whatever happens to be exciting to me.
[1695.78 → 1698.08] But, yeah, video person.
[1698.08 → 1699.26] All right.
[1699.32 → 1700.16] Well, that's awesome.
[1700.32 → 1715.92] So, Mr. Video Person, there has been a fair bit of extremely crazy news this week that has an awful lot to do with your area of, I'd say, I hate to call something your area of expertise because I feel like that paints you into a little bit of a box here.
[1716.14 → 1721.12] But phones and mobile devices, you are like the man right now on YouTube.
[1721.12 → 1723.06] And it has been a huge week.
[1723.72 → 1725.58] Shall we open with the Apple Town Hall?
[1726.22 → 1726.46] Sure.
[1727.08 → 1727.92] That works.
[1728.06 → 1730.08] Yeah, so there was an Apple event this week.
[1730.28 → 1735.94] And, of course, every time that happens, you know, the whole tech world, not even the mobile world, but the whole tech world freaks out.
[1736.82 → 1738.22] Just drops everything.
[1738.52 → 1738.74] Yeah.
[1739.74 → 1743.38] So the new iPhone 5S you guys are talking about and 5C.
[1745.02 → 1747.16] And then a little bit more on iOS 7.
[1747.36 → 1748.76] And then they were done.
[1748.76 → 1755.34] So they're going to have another Apple event later this year, which I'm actually more excited about than this past one.
[1755.90 → 1758.34] But this one was just new iPhones.
[1758.50 → 1762.88] And, yes, I did, for the record, pre-order my iPhone 5C.
[1763.16 → 1763.38] So that should be interesting.
[1763.38 → 1763.90] What colour did you get?
[1763.90 → 1764.00] Right.
[1764.72 → 1766.96] I went with what I call Lucia Yellow.
[1767.64 → 1768.08] Me too.
[1768.60 → 1768.86] Yeah.
[1769.02 → 1771.22] That seems to be the most popular one from what I've seen on Twitter.
[1771.92 → 1772.34] All right.
[1772.38 → 1772.86] That's awesome.
[1772.92 → 1777.56] Did you get yourself one of the flexible silicone cases to go with it?
[1777.56 → 1778.82] Yeah, the cheese grater case.
[1778.88 → 1779.60] I got a black one.
[1780.22 → 1780.78] Me too.
[1781.00 → 1782.92] So it'll look exactly like a Lucia, basically.
[1783.22 → 1783.58] Not quite.
[1784.06 → 1784.40] All right.
[1784.42 → 1784.70] Excellent.
[1784.86 → 1786.70] So let's talk 5C.
[1787.30 → 1787.74] Plastic.
[1788.32 → 1788.72] Sorry.
[1789.30 → 1790.82] Polycarbonate for the back.
[1791.00 → 1792.48] Is this a step backwards?
[1792.74 → 1796.44] Like, are we going back to iPhone 3G sort of era?
[1797.02 → 1799.32] Or was this a necessary step?
[1801.18 → 1804.60] I would say because the way phones are being built now is changing a lot.
[1804.60 → 1808.56] Like, this year by itself, I feel like we've seen a lot more colourful devices.
[1808.94 → 1814.10] And that's kind of one of the few ways you can effectively, cheaply, I guess, make a bunch of colourful devices.
[1814.48 → 1820.70] So the iPhone 5C is basically the iPhone 5, but with a different shell.
[1820.82 → 1824.58] And they went with, you know, plastic or polycarbonate to make that happen.
[1824.70 → 1825.72] So now it's, you know, what is it?
[1825.74 → 1831.04] Yellow, blue, green, red, and I want to say one other colour.
[1832.64 → 1834.36] I don't know if it's a step backwards.
[1834.36 → 1837.78] I just think it's a side step because the specs are the same.
[1837.90 → 1839.42] The battery might be a tiny bit bigger.
[1839.92 → 1841.30] And it's just a bunch more options.
[1841.38 → 1842.42] And I think people like options.
[1842.56 → 1844.80] I've been with Android for a long time because I love options.
[1845.64 → 1848.22] So we'll see how people react to it, yeah.
[1848.68 → 1851.32] Is a colour really a meaningful option to you?
[1851.40 → 1853.96] I mean, it's not like Apple's never done this before.
[1854.38 → 1859.62] One of the reinvigorating turning points for the company was the launch of the iMac,
[1859.62 → 1863.50] whose claim to fame, and however much people might have made fun of it at the time,
[1863.68 → 1869.20] was the plastic coloured backs on those CRT monitors that were integrated into the computer.
[1869.70 → 1875.66] I mean, is this, is this, are we, have we just come completely full circle, and we're going to just start all over again?
[1875.66 → 1881.24] Yeah, I think there are two sides or two stages of like a coloured device.
[1881.70 → 1885.96] Stage one is looking at all the different options and thinking, wow, I could have any of those colours.
[1886.08 → 1886.70] That's great.
[1886.78 → 1888.14] I think I want to pick my favourite one.
[1888.72 → 1893.40] And then stage two is you bought one, and then you're stuck with that colour for the rest of your contract.
[1893.40 → 1899.06] And you kind of have to decide if you actually want to have that colour for the rest of your contract
[1899.06 → 1903.74] or if you're just going to go with the black or white one anyway and just go with the standard phone.
[1904.08 → 1906.28] Just accessorize it the same way that you always do.
[1906.38 → 1907.76] I mean, here's my HTC One.
[1908.54 → 1911.48] For those of you who watch my videos, this won't be a surprise at all.
[1911.58 → 1914.00] I do like the whole idea of having colourful devices,
[1914.18 → 1918.66] but I feel like integrating the cheesy plastic into the product in the first place
[1918.66 → 1921.78] wasn't necessarily the right solution.
[1921.78 → 1922.58] Yeah.
[1923.34 → 1924.40] Also, pricing.
[1924.64 → 1930.58] They came out with pricing of $99 for the 16 gig version and $199 for the 32 gig version.
[1931.94 → 1932.94] Totally unexciting?
[1933.56 → 1935.84] Yeah, that's, I mean, it's kind of underwhelming because
[1935.84 → 1939.36] same thing kind of happened with the Moto X where people were speculating on,
[1939.68 → 1941.34] oh, this is going to be that really cheap phone.
[1941.40 → 1944.26] This is finally going to be super inexpensive and that it's not.
[1944.36 → 1946.80] And we, you know, we never got any confirmation that it would be.
[1946.80 → 1951.30] So naturally, everyone is disappointed with something that we didn't know was going to be a thing
[1951.30 → 1952.00] or not anyway.
[1952.68 → 1955.40] So on my end of it, I don't really care.
[1955.60 → 1957.90] Like I wasn't, I wasn't banking on it being really cheap,
[1958.08 → 1961.62] but I can understand a lot of people who were assuming it was going to be free
[1961.62 → 1963.76] now being a little bit disappointed.
[1963.76 → 1968.22] When I first heard of it, I definitely thought it was going to be free because it looks like
[1968.22 → 1969.50] the cheaper consumer model.
[1969.82 → 1974.54] And it looks like the type of device that was tuned to someone that would not care as
[1974.54 → 1978.96] much about, this was very early on, before we knew the specs were basically the exact
[1978.96 → 1979.26] same.
[1980.64 → 1983.46] But it looks like it was tuned to someone who didn't care as much about the specs and
[1983.46 → 1984.28] wanted something colourful.
[1984.68 → 1985.50] But it's not.
[1985.50 → 1989.80] And I mean, to me, the I think one of the most ridiculous things about this is the fact
[1989.80 → 1996.14] that Apple is completely ignoring the used market in a way that, I mean, I guess not
[1996.14 → 2001.40] everyone is willing to pick up a used iPhone 5 when someone else in their family upgraded
[2001.40 → 2003.40] to a 5S or whatever the case may be.
[2003.60 → 2008.72] But the way that they've priced this less expensive alternative really makes other phones
[2008.72 → 2012.68] much more attractive options to me, even if it's something like an older iPhone.
[2012.68 → 2014.20] Yeah, yeah.
[2014.34 → 2017.84] I'm seeing, like, I'm seeing other phones that would definitely be more, even, like,
[2017.88 → 2020.74] a lot of people are going to just go with it anyway because it's an iPhone.
[2021.00 → 2024.18] But when you take a step back and look at the other phones and the way it's priced with,
[2024.26 → 2027.44] you know, other $99 phones, there are way better choices for $99.
[2027.88 → 2032.18] And there are also great cheap phones that you would probably go with if you're considering
[2032.18 → 2032.82] a whole spectrum.
[2032.94 → 2035.82] If you really want a free phone, there are great choices already.
[2036.58 → 2036.90] Absolutely.
[2037.56 → 2040.90] Okay, I mean, and that was pretty much it for the 5C, wasn't it?
[2041.20 → 2041.40] Yeah.
[2041.40 → 2041.52] Yeah.
[2042.24 → 2045.82] Did you watch the official Apple video on the 5C?
[2046.18 → 2046.76] I did.
[2047.22 → 2048.20] Wasn't it painful?
[2048.54 → 2049.12] Oh, my God.
[2049.20 → 2051.48] Well, first, that whole case thing, by the way.
[2051.88 → 2054.54] I mean, can I just for a second say how that case is awful?
[2055.16 → 2056.16] It's kind of embarrassing.
[2056.72 → 2059.94] If I was working at Apple, I'd just have my head in my hands like, what?
[2060.14 → 2060.44] Who?
[2060.90 → 2061.24] What?
[2061.72 → 2062.66] What happened here?
[2063.56 → 2064.94] The whole cheeseburger thing.
[2065.02 → 2065.88] But that's another story.
[2066.10 → 2066.72] And then...
[2066.72 → 2067.86] And it's going to get so dirty.
[2067.86 → 2069.80] I mean, there's going to...
[2069.80 → 2069.96] Yeah.
[2070.06 → 2071.12] Like, junk's going to get in there.
[2071.58 → 2071.62] Definitely.
[2072.14 → 2072.32] Yeah.
[2073.88 → 2074.24] Sorry.
[2074.28 → 2074.52] Go ahead.
[2074.58 → 2074.86] Go ahead.
[2075.04 → 2075.22] Go ahead.
[2075.22 → 2075.46] Yeah, no.
[2075.58 → 2076.58] So I'm not a fan of the case.
[2076.70 → 2081.50] But the iPhone 5C, the colour combos, like, I keep going back to the Moto X because I feel
[2081.50 → 2084.92] like that was a pretty solid stepping stone in terms of customizable phones.
[2085.36 → 2086.90] My Moto X is black and yellow.
[2087.46 → 2089.46] And it'll be black and yellow forever.
[2089.90 → 2094.58] But if I want to grab another case for a phone or an accessory for a phone that'll, you know,
[2094.68 → 2099.90] accent it up for maybe a couple of months or maybe just one day or whatever I want, that's,
[2100.02 → 2102.90] I guess, more expensive in the long run when you buy more stuff.
[2103.28 → 2104.56] But it's also way more temporary.
[2104.56 → 2107.34] And if you get sick and tired of something, you can switch it out.
[2107.66 → 2107.90] So...
[2107.90 → 2109.44] And it's an incremental expense.
[2109.70 → 2114.20] I mean, it's one thing to drop however many hundreds of dollars on the phone and the case
[2114.20 → 2117.26] and the charger and the HDMI dongle and all of that all at the same time.
[2117.36 → 2122.26] But I think that the market has shown again and again and again that it's willing to accept
[2122.26 → 2127.72] smaller transactions or microtransactions along the way versus a huge upfront cost.
[2127.72 → 2134.04] So basically, I guess your thing and actually my thing as well is love the idea of the 5C
[2134.04 → 2136.28] and the cases and the official Apple accessories.
[2136.58 → 2140.90] I mean, they've done this kind of thing before, like with their iPad covers and that kind of thing.
[2141.02 → 2144.40] But just the implementation, you kind of look at it, and you just got to shake your head.
[2144.76 → 2144.94] Yeah.
[2145.26 → 2150.92] I mean, I'd say the only worst thing I've seen out of Apple was the last time they did an iPhone case,
[2151.00 → 2151.62] which was the bumper.
[2152.16 → 2152.56] Yeah.
[2153.34 → 2153.58] Yeah.
[2153.58 → 2154.24] That thing was horrible.
[2154.24 → 2155.26] That was kind of a necessity.
[2155.26 → 2157.74] Yeah, you needed it at the time.
[2157.86 → 2162.46] I wouldn't consider the cheese grater case, which I'm going to refer to it as that from now on.
[2162.70 → 2169.50] I wouldn't consider that a mandatory accessory to your phone, but it's the first party option,
[2169.68 → 2171.90] which is what a lot of people are going to see when they walk in the store.
[2172.00 → 2173.58] So I feel like they really could have done that a lot better.
[2175.06 → 2181.24] And did it just seem like the script for that video, they were just kind of dying inside,
[2181.52 → 2184.00] justifying the unapologetic plastic?
[2184.00 → 2185.00] Yeah.
[2185.16 → 2189.72] That might have been the first time they read the script, and they were just not happy.
[2190.06 → 2194.10] But, you know, that guy, I feel like it was, was it Phil Schiller that said that in the video?
[2194.24 → 2197.56] Like, he's always spoken that kind of way in his videos.
[2197.64 → 2198.64] And he kind of has to say it.
[2198.88 → 2204.34] And when you think about it, the whole Apple event is basically an ad because the only people
[2204.34 → 2207.02] watching that are those who are looking for more information about it.
[2207.02 → 2209.46] So they kind of have to talk about it that way.
[2209.54 → 2216.88] And it's, you know, beautifully sculpted, unapologetic, polycarbonate, like, we get it.
[2216.90 → 2217.46] It's plastic.
[2217.62 → 2219.08] But that's the way it's going to be.
[2219.48 → 2226.52] I mean, with that said, I have encountered better made plastic devices than other worse made plastic devices.
[2226.52 → 2227.18] Mm-hmm.
[2227.64 → 2228.62] They have a point.
[2228.84 → 2232.22] But until I actually have it in my hands, I'm not quite sure what I think about it.
[2232.50 → 2232.66] Yeah.
[2233.10 → 2233.50] Yeah.
[2234.02 → 2234.46] Okay.
[2234.68 → 2237.78] So why don't we move on to 5S?
[2238.02 → 2239.78] How excited are you about this device?
[2239.78 → 2245.94] Um, I'm actually less excited about it than I am about the 5C, which might sound weird on paper.
[2246.56 → 2248.76] But I, you know what?
[2248.86 → 2253.24] It's because the display size of the iPhones in general has always been like a thing for me.
[2253.30 → 2257.16] Like, I don't like the smaller screen on the iPhone.
[2257.28 → 2263.86] So when I hear newest, highest end Apple flagship, I would be excited for something with a larger display.
[2264.08 → 2267.88] But again, it lets me down the biggest in that department with a 4-inch display.
[2267.88 → 2268.24] Okay, so.
[2269.12 → 2272.78] Okay, well, I'm going to play devil's advocate with you for a minute here.
[2272.86 → 2279.42] And I'm going to go, okay, something like the HTC One, which I use and enjoy, and I love every day.
[2280.14 → 2280.96] Like, every day.
[2281.52 → 2281.92] Anyway.
[2282.36 → 2284.66] You know, like I love it is too big for my hands.
[2285.02 → 2287.50] And I'm not the only person in the world with small hands.
[2287.58 → 2290.28] Now, I've seen your baseball glove-like mitts.
[2290.74 → 2292.22] And they're big.
[2292.22 → 2297.96] So for you, something like a Galaxy Note even probably wouldn't be that difficult to handle.
[2298.08 → 2304.58] But for me, something like an iPhone, particularly without the UI changes they've made in iOS 7,
[2304.78 → 2310.04] where you no longer have to reach up into the very top corner to access things from time to time.
[2310.46 → 2313.30] An iPhone was perfect because I could actually touch the whole thing.
[2313.30 → 2320.92] And many cultures, for example, or many other races of people, such as over in Asia, have lots of people with relatively small hands.
[2321.04 → 2325.36] Is Apple not necessarily wrong to keep with a smaller form factor?
[2325.36 → 2330.38] I think a lot of the reasons why it's still in that body is because it's a 5S.
[2330.66 → 2335.28] And I'm more excited about the next iPhone because that's going to be a bigger jump.
[2335.80 → 2339.40] I'm a big fan of the size of the Moto X.
[2339.70 → 2343.30] And it happens to be a 4.7-inch display, the same as the HTC One.
[2343.46 → 2345.16] But it is a lot smaller in the hand.
[2345.28 → 2345.98] It's a smaller phone.
[2346.12 → 2350.28] And I feel like anyone with any size hand can easily reach all four corners of the display.
[2350.46 → 2352.82] So I'm a fan of the form factor.
[2352.82 → 2354.92] I'm holding it now like I'm showing you, but I can't show you.
[2354.92 → 2359.42] But it feels like that's about the right size that a lot of people will like.
[2359.52 → 2361.70] And it's a phone that I recommend to a lot of iPhone switchers.
[2362.72 → 2363.48] But, yeah, you're right.
[2363.54 → 2368.42] There are a lot of people who are going to look at something like the Galaxy S4 and go, that's just way too big.
[2368.46 → 2370.24] I would never go with a 5-inch phone.
[2370.86 → 2372.86] And that's totally acceptable.
[2373.04 → 2375.06] And I can see why those people will stick with an iPhone.
[2375.78 → 2377.10] Now, we've been very – oh, sorry.
[2377.16 → 2377.36] Go ahead.
[2377.62 → 2378.06] No, no, go ahead.
[2378.46 → 2380.64] We've been very focused on the hardware so far.
[2380.76 → 2382.78] But what about something like work?
[2382.78 → 2387.18] I mean, you're a Mac user, which is part of the reason why even though, guys, just a reminder,
[2387.36 → 2389.16] the WAN show is powered by Racer comes.
[2389.66 → 2391.40] And Bloop, you can download it there.
[2391.48 → 2391.96] Try it out.
[2392.02 → 2393.52] It's a great gaming voice chat client.
[2393.66 → 2394.76] It's beta right now.
[2394.84 → 2397.10] But sort of if you're willing to put up with that, then there you go.
[2397.38 → 2402.20] So part of the reason you weren't actually able to call in with comes for us today is you don't have a Windows PC.
[2402.60 → 2402.74] Right.
[2402.74 → 2403.78] You're running a Hackintosh.
[2404.22 → 2404.40] Yeah.
[2406.20 → 2406.48] work.
[2406.94 → 2418.68] Is work poised to take on Google Drive and Microsoft Office with Apple's introduction of works as being completely free on iOS 7?
[2419.52 → 2419.72] Yeah.
[2419.72 → 2424.90] So I look at that from like there are two ways or two sides that that could have an effect on.
[2425.04 → 2431.90] The first side is like the consumer side, like you and I and students and mom and dad and people who are just using it to get stuff done.
[2432.36 → 2436.72] And I think that absolutely has a huge effect on all those people because now it's free.
[2436.72 → 2440.78] And it absolutely has the same functionality of all those other services.
[2441.36 → 2452.74] But then there's the other side, which is like the business side and the enterprise side and university side where all these guys, especially I'm in university right now, and they like they make us use Word 2007.
[2453.28 → 2456.38] Like you have to use Word 2007 and Excel 2007.
[2457.06 → 2459.76] And it's a compatibility issue if you use anything else.
[2459.84 → 2464.26] There are macros and all kinds of plugins and stuff built in that don't work with the newer versions.
[2464.26 → 2476.26] So even if it is free and even if it is just as functional, it's a bigger deal to switch users like that over to a new platform, even if it is, you know, the cheapest thing in the world.
[2477.04 → 2481.46] But even if it's difficult, is it bound to happen eventually?
[2481.68 → 2489.82] I mean, it was, you know, when back when I was in university, the campus wide Wi-Fi was wireless G, and therefore it could never be upgraded.
[2489.82 → 2490.06] Right.
[2490.12 → 2492.16] But of course it will at some point.
[2492.16 → 2495.10] And is Apple positioning themselves as a viable alternative?
[2495.88 → 2497.44] At this point, yes, they are.
[2497.70 → 2503.40] But it's also going to move alongside OS X, I guess, with that whole market share.
[2503.72 → 2505.06] Is that the right word to use?
[2505.14 → 2508.88] Because, you know, these people have to switch to OS X before they can switch to work.
[2509.36 → 2509.86] And a lot of the people are...
[2509.86 → 2512.04] Well, they do have a cloud version of work that they're...
[2512.04 → 2512.22] True.
[2512.70 → 2513.86] ...that they're working on.
[2513.98 → 2515.24] And they're making it available.
[2515.42 → 2517.86] I mean, that'll make it available across every platform.
[2517.86 → 2522.74] And once it's ubiquitous, then all of a sudden it's not tied to the market share of...
[2522.74 → 2529.54] But when it's a Cloud-based application, will it be drawn back like the other ones and then not used nearly as much just like all the other ones?
[2529.70 → 2531.42] Depends on how they want to see this play out?
[2531.44 → 2532.68] It depends on the user.
[2533.32 → 2533.52] Yeah.
[2533.64 → 2542.08] Like Google Drive, I believe you can export like a regular Google Drive document to a PDF or to a format that Word can handle just fine.
[2542.08 → 2543.74] But, yeah.
[2545.24 → 2545.96] All right.
[2546.28 → 2548.52] Let's talk about the juicy fingerprint scanner.
[2548.90 → 2549.28] Oh, boy.
[2550.66 → 2550.94] Yeah.
[2551.44 → 2553.12] Okay, I'm going to preface this.
[2553.36 → 2556.24] I'm super stoked on this, and I'm super positive about it.
[2556.26 → 2557.50] And it kind of sounds like you're not.
[2557.62 → 2558.20] So, hit me.
[2558.64 → 2559.90] No, I actually like it.
[2559.96 → 2565.58] So, the first time I had a biometric fingerprint reader in a device was not the Matrix, like so many people are referring to.
[2565.58 → 2569.42] But it was my HP Pavilion DV7T.
[2569.58 → 2572.76] So, it's a laptop that I like first started making YouTube videos on.
[2572.82 → 2575.50] It was like a desktop replacement laptop in 2009.
[2576.32 → 2582.26] And in the bottom right corner, you could use that, you know, biometric fingerprint scanner to log yourself not only into Windows,
[2582.86 → 2588.38] but into like a bunch of stuff within Windows, within Internet Explorer, within, you know, all these different applications.
[2588.86 → 2591.02] So, I really liked it and I use it all the time.
[2591.02 → 2594.88] When I switched off of it, I kind of missed it for a little bit but then didn't care anymore.
[2594.88 → 2599.78] But with Apple, I feel like it's one of those things where once you get to using it and once a whole, you know,
[2599.84 → 2604.16] the several million people that are inevitably going to buy this phone start to get to using it,
[2604.22 → 2606.98] they're going to look around at other choices and say, well, I can't switch.
[2607.04 → 2607.98] I love my fingerprint reader.
[2608.06 → 2609.44] I can't have it anymore.
[2609.90 → 2611.44] So, it's a big deal.
[2611.70 → 2616.32] I'm excited for it, and I'm excited for other manufacturers to start trying it because that's always what happens.
[2617.54 → 2623.32] I wonder who's the first one to attempt to get back into this whole fingerprint reader on a phone thing.
[2623.40 → 2624.12] Maybe Motor again.
[2624.12 → 2624.92] Maybe someone else.
[2625.62 → 2632.36] But it's funny you mention that because it seems like it must have been about 20 minutes after Apple talked about their 64-bit processor
[2632.36 → 2634.64] that Samsung came out and said, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.
[2634.88 → 2636.66] We're going to have 64-bit on the next one.
[2636.72 → 2637.70] Everyone just hold off.
[2637.80 → 2638.32] Don't buy it.
[2638.36 → 2639.12] Don't buy it yet.
[2639.72 → 2639.98] Yeah.
[2640.46 → 2641.94] Yeah, no, that's the Apple effect.
[2642.08 → 2649.20] It kind of has a ripple effect where the closest competitors will immediately start to work on things that compete with it or leapfrog it.
[2649.52 → 2651.82] And then you see that effect kind of get carried out into everywhere else.
[2651.82 → 2655.58] But I think the fingerprint reader is going to be one of those things that we start to see pop up more.
[2656.00 → 2658.24] I mean, I absolutely love it.
[2658.46 → 2666.44] And I'm going to give you kind of weird perspective on it because my iPhone 4, which I still use as an MP3 player because I hope HTC is not watching right now.
[2666.44 → 2669.52] But guys, the onboard audio on this thing is just terrible.
[2670.48 → 2671.50] Like, it's just awful.
[2671.84 → 2674.20] Anyway, so I use my iPhone 4 as an MP3 player.
[2674.50 → 2675.90] And so I still use it a fair bit.
[2676.16 → 2680.52] Now, I have it set up to wipe if you try to unlock it more than five times or whatever their number is.
[2680.72 → 2681.72] I have a baby.
[2682.38 → 2683.90] He gets my phone sometimes.
[2683.90 → 2688.84] And if he sits and attempts to unlock the iPhone, he's figured out, you know, swipe the bar.
[2689.24 → 2690.82] Like, that's how intuitive Apple is.
[2691.16 → 2696.02] And for that matter, Google, he can open Candy Crush now on my wife's droid DNA.
[2696.54 → 2696.66] Wow.
[2697.18 → 2698.04] Yeah, it's crazy.
[2698.14 → 2699.12] He's like 16 months old.
[2699.20 → 2700.22] And you're like, holy crap.
[2700.32 → 2700.50] Anyway.
[2701.16 → 2701.74] That's baby tips.
[2701.74 → 2712.58] So something like a fingerprint reader built into the device saves me from my phone being accidentally wiped by my kids accidentally trying to access it.
[2712.64 → 2714.74] So if I use that instead of a passcode that wipes it.
[2715.08 → 2725.90] It also is both exciting and terrifying, both as a keychain, so using it as validation and authentication for a bunch of other stuff, but also the convenience of it is just scary.
[2726.36 → 2729.38] What does this do for something like App Store purchases?
[2729.38 → 2736.86] Because it will prevent things like unauthorized ones, but it will make an App Store purchase that much easier.
[2737.56 → 2737.70] Yeah.
[2738.04 → 2748.08] So this reminds me, all the things you just mentioned remind me of the face unlock that was in Android when it first got introduced in Android, I think 4.0.
[2748.76 → 2752.76] And it had a lot of the same pros and cons where, oh, what does this mean for security?
[2752.76 → 2756.98] And I guess, you know, theoretically you can't get locked out of your phone because you can only look at it once.
[2756.98 → 2760.86] But it never got built, like, deeper into Android.
[2761.00 → 2771.16] Like, it never got thrown into the Play Store where you can use your face to buy apps and use your face to unlock things the way that Apple looks like they're planning to with iTunes and things like that.
[2771.22 → 2777.50] So it's a more interesting story with the fingerprint reader because that has way deeper implications when they start to use it more.
[2777.50 → 2781.92] And the facial recognition was very easy to bypass, actually.
[2782.14 → 2783.70] And that's one thing about the fingerprint scanner.
[2783.88 → 2784.80] It's really not.
[2785.32 → 2785.54] Right.
[2785.54 → 2790.82] Now, this is actually, I don't know if you've seen this, but this is a fantastic MythBusters.
[2790.92 → 2795.12] I'm going to play, I guess, about a minute and a half of it.
[2795.68 → 2796.22] Here we go.
[2796.34 → 2799.04] So now Apple actually acquired a company.
[2799.20 → 2802.98] So they should have, in theory, some of the most advanced fingerprint recognition.
[2803.22 → 2804.80] So they're reading subdermal data.
[2804.92 → 2808.48] They've got a sapphire lens that focuses it perfectly, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[2808.82 → 2810.28] But check this out.
[2811.00 → 2812.32] So let's go ahead and play this.
[2813.36 → 2814.32] Guys, ready?
[2814.32 → 2818.54] Yeah, we've been working on this for days, and I think we have a couple of things that might work.
[2818.64 → 2818.94] Cool.
[2819.16 → 2819.34] Okay.
[2819.56 → 2822.54] So they're trying to defeat a fingerprint door lock.
[2822.56 → 2822.76] Okay.
[2823.68 → 2825.12] My patented Sahara thumb.
[2830.92 → 2833.66] So this is a thin thing that fits over his thumb.
[2833.66 → 2836.22] Adam resets and tries again, but nothing.
[2836.98 → 2842.30] With this technique dribbling towards busted, Adam tries licking the latex.
[2842.96 → 2843.24] Hey!
[2843.24 → 2844.34] And he's in.
[2844.46 → 2848.60] He has set off the next alarm, but the finger's been foiled.
[2849.30 → 2850.52] I don't care about the alarm.
[2850.60 → 2851.46] It works, Sam!
[2851.52 → 2852.52] No way!
[2853.08 → 2855.86] That is latex glued to my thumb.
[2856.22 → 2858.06] But they're not stopping there.
[2858.52 → 2859.50] Well, that's one down.
[2859.58 → 2861.40] Shall we try all of our other techniques?
[2861.96 → 2866.88] Next up, it's Jamie, who's made a regular ballistics gel print of Grant's thumb.
[2866.88 → 2868.24] And guess what?
[2868.96 → 2869.26] Yay!
[2869.58 → 2869.94] Hey!
[2870.54 → 2871.64] Nicely done!
[2873.24 → 2874.70] That's two for two!
[2874.96 → 2875.74] No way!
[2875.74 → 2881.62] At this point, the one we bought for the computer is a lot harder to break than this one.
[2881.84 → 2882.02] Yeah.
[2882.70 → 2884.76] Well, I say we move on to the copy paper now.
[2884.76 → 2891.50] With everything they do working, the team goes for broke by trying the photocopy of Grant's print.
[2891.72 → 2895.34] No warmth and no pulse, just a licked piece of paper.
[2895.34 → 2898.90] Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[2899.32 → 2908.32] So, hopefully everyone enjoyed that clip where ultimately there was a fingerprint reading door lock
[2908.32 → 2912.10] that managed to be defeated by a licked piece of paper.
[2912.64 → 2915.56] So, earlier on in the clip, you guys should definitely check it out.
[2915.62 → 2917.48] It's MythBusters Fingerprints Busted HD.
[2917.76 → 2922.12] They show how they acquired the thumbprint, and it was just by having him copy a CD,
[2922.82 → 2924.24] and he left it on the jewel case.
[2924.60 → 2925.12] Oh, okay.
[2925.34 → 2928.80] And so, with that, they were able to defeat it that easily.
[2928.90 → 2934.82] I'll be very interested to see MythBusters or someone similar take a crack at the iPhone 5S implementation.
[2935.20 → 2941.14] At the same time, though, I think it might be harder to do that than to just figure out someone's typed-in password,
[2941.34 → 2943.22] to be completely honest, on a phone.
[2943.36 → 2945.56] So many people do it out in the open, it would be so easy.
[2945.78 → 2949.68] Well, Apple's claiming that their sensor will look for signs of life.
[2950.04 → 2950.50] Okay.
[2950.98 → 2953.06] As well as reading subdermal layers.
[2953.06 → 2957.88] There's the conductivity ring around the outside for one, which is pretty easy to bypass, but still.
[2959.10 → 2962.62] But anyway, I just thought that was kind of a fun video right there.
[2962.62 → 2966.84] So, I asked folks on Twitter to tweet us any questions that they had for you.
[2966.92 → 2973.86] So, our whole concept here is we do what we call Twitter Blitz, and answer the questions as quickly as possible,
[2974.10 → 2975.58] and then try to move on to the next one.
[2975.62 → 2976.02] Are you game?
[2976.36 → 2976.66] All right.
[2976.66 → 2977.74] All right.
[2978.16 → 2981.78] So, let's just see if we've got anything directed at you here.
[2982.40 → 2982.74] Okay.
[2982.84 → 2983.90] Something about size.
[2984.54 → 2985.42] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2985.90 → 2986.30] Okay.
[2986.48 → 2986.78] Come on.
[2987.98 → 2988.38] Okay.
[2989.08 → 2993.04] I mean, a lot of the time, people kind of forget about it, and then they'll tweet us again.
[2993.14 → 2993.58] So, we'll go ahead.
[2994.02 → 2994.36] Ah!
[2994.44 → 2996.18] Ask Marcus about his appearance on The Verge.
[2996.28 → 2996.60] Go!
[2997.56 → 3002.92] I hosted a 90 Seconds on The Verge episode, and I will be hosting more, and that's a thing now.
[3003.96 → 3005.52] That's incredibly cool.
[3005.72 → 3005.90] Yeah.
[3006.94 → 3008.04] That is incredibly cool.
[3008.04 → 3014.34] So, is this part of a more involved partnership with The Verge, or is it more like you're on a talent contract?
[3014.92 → 3015.12] Yeah.
[3015.24 → 3020.82] It's essentially unannounced, but basically, we're working together behind the scenes as, like, option two of what you just said,
[3020.82 → 3027.36] sort of talent plus network collaboration, I guess is the right word.
[3027.94 → 3028.36] That's awesome.
[3028.36 → 3031.38] So, yeah, I'll be making appearances and more Verge stuff as well.
[3031.70 → 3033.48] That is incredibly exciting.
[3033.94 → 3034.38] Congratulations.
[3034.64 → 3039.04] The Verge is a big deal, and you are officially a big deal by proxy, although you were kind of already.
[3039.86 → 3040.44] Thank you.
[3041.32 → 3041.82] All right.
[3041.86 → 3044.46] Let's see if anyone has gone ahead and hit that.
[3044.56 → 3044.80] Ah!
[3044.86 → 3045.12] Okay.
[3045.84 → 3046.62] Nexus 5.
[3047.86 → 3049.42] Nexus 5 looks interesting.
[3049.42 → 3052.48] I like what I'm hearing in terms of, like, build.
[3052.64 → 3058.74] It looks like it's going to be loosely based around the LG G2, which I'm looking at right now, and I love the front of.
[3059.12 → 3059.94] So, that's good news.
[3060.76 → 3068.86] But we'll have to see, like, all the other things that Nexus devices never do well, like the camera and things like that need to be verified
[3068.86 → 3072.28] before I can say that I definitely want to buy a device like the Nexus 5.
[3072.84 → 3073.06] Right.
[3073.42 → 3073.76] All right.
[3073.80 → 3075.50] What's your take on the Ubuntu Edge?
[3075.50 → 3084.10] I was really disappointed that it didn't happen, but it had, like, so much promise that I feel like they're going to do something about that project anyway.
[3084.24 → 3089.42] Like, there was so much interest in it in the first place that they might as well follow through with something related to it.
[3089.78 → 3092.68] Do you think in the back of their minds they knew it wasn't going to work?
[3092.68 → 3093.74] I think so.
[3094.12 → 3094.24] Yeah.
[3094.34 → 3094.54] Okay.
[3094.64 → 3100.84] And even reading some of their language and, like, the press releases and the updates in their emails, I feel like they knew.
[3101.22 → 3107.42] But they kind of had to phrase it in a way that made it sound like they had all the hope in the world that it would actually happen, but it didn't.
[3107.80 → 3112.00] It seemed like more what they cared about was breaking records and getting press going about it, which they totally accomplished.
[3112.28 → 3113.40] Which they definitely did.
[3113.40 → 3115.48] I mean, they raised almost 13 mid.
[3115.92 → 3116.08] Yeah.
[3116.12 → 3128.56] After the point where they, like, you know, there wasn't really enough time to actually complete the $32 million goal, they kind of focused, they shifted their focus more to all the support they'd gotten and how remarkable it was that they'd gotten as far as they did anyway.
[3129.06 → 3129.30] Yeah.
[3129.68 → 3131.82] So how do you afford all of your tech goodies?
[3131.82 → 3136.14] A lot of buying and selling, I guess.
[3136.26 → 3141.26] There's a lot of circular transactions going on where I'll buy a device and review it.
[3141.42 → 3146.20] And then when I want to buy another device to review, I'll sell the one that I no longer use and it kind of circles in and out.
[3147.56 → 3148.04] All right.
[3149.34 → 3153.04] Apple keeps the screen small so they don't have to up resolution, et cetera, et cetera.
[3153.20 → 3153.54] Okay.
[3153.90 → 3156.74] Is the Bear Dynamic Custom 1 Pro still your preferred headphone?
[3156.74 → 3162.62] I switched back to the ATH-M50s not too long ago because there's a red and black version now.
[3162.68 → 3163.42] So I picked that up.
[3163.46 → 3164.54] And, of course, I love red and black.
[3164.70 → 3166.08] So I couldn't say no to that.
[3168.52 → 3168.88] Okay.
[3169.36 → 3170.36] Not mentioning this.
[3170.44 → 3171.36] Anything you feel about?
[3171.50 → 3171.72] Okay.
[3172.08 → 3172.50] I see.
[3174.38 → 3175.00] I think.
[3175.10 → 3175.76] You're going back through.
[3176.04 → 3176.66] Oh, yeah.
[3176.72 → 3177.02] Okay.
[3177.26 → 3177.74] That's done.
[3177.80 → 3180.38] Let's see if we've got a couple more, and then we'll move on to phone.
[3180.44 → 3180.70] Okay.
[3180.78 → 3183.24] Well, of course, we get a tweet about phone block.
[3183.38 → 3184.54] You've heard about this, right?
[3184.82 → 3185.18] Yeah.
[3185.18 → 3185.26] Okay.
[3185.50 → 3185.82] Okay.
[3185.94 → 3187.16] We'll talk about that after.
[3187.26 → 3190.44] Let's just see if we've got any thoughts on GTA V.
[3190.70 → 3192.02] You're not much of a gamer, are you?
[3192.36 → 3192.70] No.
[3192.80 → 3196.88] I'm not much of a gamer, but I do like the only type of game that I play is racing games.
[3197.04 → 3201.14] So if I were to consider a Grand Theft Auto, that's a little bit of a stretch.
[3201.26 → 3206.34] But I'm looking forward to the Forces and the I guess, other driving games like Sforza,
[3206.50 → 3208.26] basically, when the new consoles are out.
[3208.82 → 3211.92] Will 64-bit processors on mobile really make a difference?
[3211.92 → 3215.20] Not now, but later, yes.
[3216.40 → 3219.84] Actually, this was something I had in the town hall topic.
[3219.92 → 3222.58] So I'm going to go ahead, and I'm going to kill the Twitter blitz for now.
[3222.92 → 3226.30] And let's go ahead and chat about 64-bit a little bit.
[3226.30 → 3241.78] I feel like the way that Apple moved to 64-bit on the desktop and on their notebooks was a lot more elegant and a lot less fragmented than the way that Microsoft and sort of the Winter Alliance handled it on the PC side.
[3241.78 → 3250.70] Do you expect to see the same degree of, I guess, seamlessness on the mobile OS?
[3250.70 → 3261.82] And do you expect to see the same degree of fragmentation on the Android side where no one will, I suspect, Google, much like Microsoft has had to do,
[3262.02 → 3271.00] will have to support 32-bit and 64-bits of future OSes for quite a long time to accommodate that wide variety that happens to be out there?
[3271.00 → 3274.00] Yeah, I would say yes and yes.
[3274.30 → 3281.62] And on the Android side, it's kind of weird because, like you said, the changeover from one OS to the next is always really slow on Android devices.
[3281.76 → 3285.36] Like, no matter where you go, if you're not a Nexus, it's going to be a slow changeover.
[3285.92 → 3293.48] So, yeah, over and over again, iterations are going to have to be either supported in both 32-bit and 64-bit or just dropped altogether.
[3293.66 → 3297.38] And I don't think they want to drop 32-bit so fast that they piss off developers.
[3297.38 → 3304.96] Apple on stage kind of made it seem like they're doing this to make it easier for developers, like, in the long run,
[3305.06 → 3308.96] like, just locking it in and making sure it works for everyone.
[3309.24 → 3312.42] But, yeah, on the Android side, it'll get a lot more interesting.
[3312.80 → 3314.98] And I think fragmentation is a good word to describe that.
[3315.52 → 3322.06] I mean, I think one of the things that I enjoy so much about iOS, I mean, if the 5S knocks my socks off, I may switch back.
[3322.14 → 3323.46] I'm not married to Android.
[3323.56 → 3324.48] I'm not married to iOS.
[3324.48 → 3330.46] And one of the things that I like so much about it is how tight the experience is.
[3330.56 → 3338.52] There's no such thing at, well, okay, to a lesser degree, as downloading an app from the App Store, and it just doesn't work on your device.
[3338.88 → 3339.46] Mm-hmm.
[3339.56 → 3348.46] But it's, it, I suspect that that's going to get 5 to 10 times worse as we go through this 32-bit to 64-bit transition on Android.
[3348.46 → 3351.56] And I suspect some people are going to be turned off by it.
[3351.62 → 3353.82] Do you think people will just kind of power through it or?
[3353.82 → 3356.74] Uh, the way it is now, I guess so.
[3356.98 → 3360.64] Uh, that's the only way we kind of handle it now is just if it doesn't work, oh well.
[3360.86 → 3365.02] And if it does work, thank God it works because that, that changeover is always slow.
[3365.42 → 3369.82] Although I have a feeling like with, with right now with compatibility problems, usually it's unforeseen.
[3370.48 → 3374.96] But with a 32-bit versus 64-bit comparison, it should probably know before you try to install it.
[3374.96 → 3375.60] Yeah.
[3376.08 → 3377.20] Yeah, there at least be that.
[3377.22 → 3380.52] So if you go to install, it should be able to detect and be like, actually, this isn't going to work.
[3381.78 → 3384.78] Which would be a little bit more graceful than it just not working.
[3385.34 → 3385.80] All right.
[3385.92 → 3388.56] So that brings us to fragmentation.
[3389.44 → 3391.72] Marcus, do you mind if we keep you for about another 10 minutes?
[3391.78 → 3392.74] I know I said half an hour.
[3392.96 → 3393.26] Yeah, sure.
[3393.86 → 3394.48] All right, cool.
[3394.58 → 3398.58] I'd actually like to play this video for the viewers if you, uh, if you don't mind that as well.
[3398.66 → 3398.84] Okay.
[3399.28 → 3401.30] So for those who haven't seen Phone Blocks.
[3401.30 → 3405.84] Every day we throw away millions of electronic devices because they get old and become worn out.
[3406.78 → 3407.56] I had that blue phone.
[3407.58 → 3409.56] It's only one of the components that causes the problem.
[3411.98 → 3415.10] The rest of the device works fine but is needlessly thrown away.
[3417.84 → 3421.30] Simply because electronic devices are not designed to last.
[3422.24 → 3425.68] This makes electronic waste one of the fastest growing waste streams in the world.
[3426.04 → 3428.02] And our phone is one of the biggest causes.
[3428.02 → 3433.04] So this is a new kind of phone.
[3435.16 → 3436.28] It's made of blocks.
[3439.68 → 3440.76] Detachable blocks.
[3442.28 → 3443.82] They are all connected to the base.
[3444.80 → 3446.58] And the base connects everything together.
[3448.06 → 3450.38] Electrical signals are transferred through the pins.
[3450.38 → 3454.40] And two small screws lock everything in place.
[3455.52 → 3460.10] So if, for instance, your phone is getting a little slow, you can just upgrade the block that affects the speed.
[3461.30 → 3464.66] Or if something breaks, you can easily replace it with a new one.
[3465.36 → 3466.98] Or update it with the latest version.
[3469.18 → 3472.18] Another great thing about this is, you can customize your phone.
[3472.18 → 3475.74] So let's say this is your phone, and you do everything in the cloud.
[3476.04 → 3478.86] Why not replace your storage block for a bigger battery block?
[3479.22 → 3483.10] If you're like this guy and love to take pictures, why not upgrade your camera?
[3484.00 → 3488.64] Or if you don't care about any of this stuff, you can keep it simple and get a bigger speaker.
[3488.64 → 3493.00] You can choose the blocks you want.
[3494.04 → 3495.40] Support the brands you like.
[3495.68 → 3495.90] Okay.
[3496.06 → 3498.44] I think that's the basic premise at this point.
[3498.64 → 3501.14] So let's get your thoughts first.
[3501.32 → 3501.58] Go.
[3502.38 → 3502.62] Okay.
[3502.92 → 3510.68] So I just did my video about it because there were so much, you know, so many questions about it that I decided to do a video basically explaining it.
[3510.68 → 3519.38] But my thoughts, I was really interested in just the sheer volume of people that were interested in this version of a dream phone concept.
[3519.38 → 3521.58] Because there's been so many, like, versions of this before.
[3523.16 → 3526.82] And the idea is great.
[3526.98 → 3529.02] Like, it's not very technically feasible.
[3529.30 → 3532.42] The mock-ups they showed were, like, just mind-blowing simple.
[3532.66 → 3536.30] But I like the fact that it's getting attention.
[3536.46 → 3539.72] I like that it's proven that it's actually something that people want.
[3540.68 → 3544.20] It's proven that it's something that people want.
[3544.28 → 3547.40] But will it prove to be something that's even remotely feasible?
[3547.54 → 3551.82] I mean, it's a great point you made about the mock-up being super simple.
[3552.02 → 3556.80] I mean, for those who are viewing the show right now, that thing won't work at all.
[3556.80 → 3560.94] It would have to, each individual component would have to be an entire unit.
[3561.12 → 3562.00] Like, you'd have to have its own.
[3562.38 → 3567.12] Because the electricity layer that they're talking about is not going to be able to transfer much data.
[3567.54 → 3568.66] So, yeah.
[3568.66 → 3579.96] I mean, you look at how many pins Intel needs to be attached to a CPU for all the various voltages and all the various grounds and all the various data and all the things that it needs to do in order to function.
[3580.54 → 3589.56] You're not going to be swapping out your, you know, processing unit and having that, expecting that to interface with everything else with, like, nine pins or whatever.
[3589.56 → 3593.70] That's why I was saying, like, it would have to have its own little motherboard inside that block.
[3593.82 → 3597.66] So that when you plug it in, the only thing being transferred is a data wire and power.
[3598.10 → 3603.36] And being able to build that, they're going to be huge comparatively and not very effective comparatively.
[3603.78 → 3604.52] Yeah, that was my thing.
[3604.52 → 3610.30] I mean, if it were to work anywhere remotely near the way it looks in the video, it would be a just huge, huge phone.
[3610.82 → 3612.06] Gigantic blocky device.
[3612.64 → 3612.76] Yeah.
[3613.22 → 3618.24] So, gigantic blocky, I mean, and to me, the other major issue is who's going to support this?
[3618.74 → 3618.96] Yeah.
[3618.96 → 3628.80] Which processor manufacturer, by the time a concept like this could be realized, which processor manufacturer remaining wouldn't just have their own platform?
[3629.20 → 3633.00] So you got Samsung, you got NVIDIA getting into hardware.
[3633.38 → 3633.64] True.
[3633.70 → 3635.78] Which is like, holy crap, what's that?
[3635.96 → 3636.14] Yeah, yeah.
[3637.80 → 3642.30] You've got, I mean, you've got Apple, of course, their own hardware, their own platform.
[3643.04 → 3646.18] Who, who, what theoretical upgrade is going to exist?
[3646.18 → 3652.10] It would be like a super limited amount of things you could upgrade to if it, if it even happened.
[3652.92 → 3662.30] But I like the, the, like, they had a couple of examples of like different ways to rearrange proportions, which looked weird at first.
[3662.42 → 3671.08] But it makes sense that you would give more priority to like, you know, have more space for camera optics and less space for a battery if you were a person who valued the camera more.
[3671.08 → 3675.68] Or more space for a speaker and less space for the camera if you're, I guess, grandma was their example.
[3675.68 → 3684.86] So at least you might not have the most intricate components like your, your sensors and your CPU and graphics and things like that be modular.
[3684.86 → 3693.14] But the fact that you could change proportions and have a bigger speaker or have a bigger or smaller battery and change simpler things like that could be more interesting.
[3693.14 → 3695.14] Maybe.
[3695.14 → 3695.54] Maybe.
[3696.32 → 3706.94] But I mean, with the variety of devices that are out there now, do you feel like if you were that photographer guy, you couldn't find the phone that's right for you?
[3706.94 → 3716.82] Or if you were that person who cares more about battery life, and you grabbed something like a Note 2, or I guess Note 3 would be the big news upcoming and put like a huge like battery back on it.
[3716.86 → 3722.80] Did you see that guy who did the, uh, the SD upgrade and the huge battery upgrade to the Note?
[3723.30 → 3724.24] I didn't see that now.
[3724.62 → 3725.44] Oh, it was epic.
[3725.44 → 3729.88] Yeah, the guy added, what was it, like a 256 gig SD card or something stupid like that?
[3729.98 → 3730.30] Oh, Geez.
[3730.30 → 3733.00] I remember the battery life, but it was a 256 gigabyte SD card.
[3733.08 → 3738.66] And then like this massive battery and then just like, like, like bent plastic over the back of it to hold it in place.
[3738.66 → 3739.98] It had like a weaker battery.
[3740.56 → 3740.74] Wow.
[3741.50 → 3743.66] Yeah, I mean, at that point it's not even pocketable, but yeah.
[3744.10 → 3751.24] The point stands that you could probably find something out there among all the choices to satisfy your, like, one critical need.
[3751.24 → 3754.60] If you're that kind of person that just has to have a big battery, you'll find something.
[3755.26 → 3757.00] And to me, this is kind of a step backwards.
[3757.24 → 3759.38] It reminds me of the evolution of the PC.
[3760.10 → 3762.72] And people have made it pretty clear what they want.
[3762.96 → 3768.02] If they wanted, um, blocky upgradable notebooks, those existed.
[3768.44 → 3768.88] Yep.
[3769.00 → 3771.20] And did not do well at all.
[3771.26 → 3772.94] Now no one cares at all.
[3773.18 → 3777.20] Same thing with desktops is the theoretical degradability of a desktop.
[3777.20 → 3778.84] I mean, okay.
[3778.84 → 3781.22] Have you ever tried to upgrade a desktop?
[3782.22 → 3783.12] I have, yes.
[3783.54 → 3783.78] Okay.
[3784.02 → 3787.66] So within a period of time of like a year or two, feasible.
[3788.54 → 3788.98] Yeah.
[3789.10 → 3789.26] Yeah.
[3790.06 → 3790.28] Okay.
[3790.68 → 3793.26] After a few years, does it make any sense?
[3793.58 → 3796.26] After a few years, you'd be better off going with a new machine.
[3797.26 → 3803.24] Which seems like what they would try to avoid looking at, like the phone blocks concept, phones go out of date even faster.
[3803.88 → 3804.38] That's true.
[3804.38 → 3804.46] Right.
[3804.64 → 3809.22] So a couple of months down the road, the whole idea of that device might get ancient.
[3809.22 → 3812.96] That's completely right though.
[3813.06 → 3818.02] That's, everyone builds their machine, and they're like, oh yeah, but I'm building it so it'll be upgradable in the future.
[3818.10 → 3818.80] That's my whole idea.
[3819.00 → 3819.30] No.
[3819.56 → 3821.56] You're doing a full platform swap by the time you get to it.
[3821.56 → 3831.20] And I mean, for, you know, for all we know, five years, ten years from now, the phone, the way that we see it today, could actually be something that completely lives in your pocket.
[3831.44 → 3838.94] And you're going to have your eyeglasses device and your watch and your, you know, bracelet and all of your other wearable stuff.
[3838.94 → 3841.66] That's the way that you actually interact with anything anyway.
[3841.66 → 3850.60] So the phone could become this completely unimportant, basically like a processing sphere that's got like a battery attached to it, and it just hides somewhere.
[3851.22 → 3851.34] So.
[3852.98 → 3853.74] That's crazy.
[3854.16 → 3855.78] That's a feature that I could see though.
[3855.80 → 3856.64] I totally imagine that.
[3856.70 → 3859.78] I've been using glass for like maybe two months now.
[3859.78 → 3867.78] And that it's kind of one of those things where you take your phone out of your pocket less because you have something else that can interface with what your phone is capable of.
[3867.78 → 3877.46] So just having a little CPU in your pocket with like no display on it or like a tiny display and valuing something else more like, you know, the processing power and the battery life.
[3877.86 → 3882.08] The idea of thin clients and then centralized processing.
[3882.28 → 3883.96] I mean, that's coming to the human body.
[3884.06 → 3885.14] I believe it very firmly.
[3885.24 → 3887.12] You even look at what Samsung's doing with the gear.
[3887.12 → 3891.78] That's almost the phone blocks idea, but blown up because then you can swap out individual parts.
[3891.94 → 3892.08] Yes.
[3892.08 → 3893.02] Which will hopefully be cheaper.
[3893.02 → 3893.20] Right.
[3893.80 → 3895.32] Or you could even have multiple ones.
[3895.42 → 3897.28] You could swap them out on a day by day basis.
[3897.40 → 3898.80] I want my camera watch today.
[3899.04 → 3899.26] Yeah.
[3899.36 → 3899.56] Right.
[3899.80 → 3902.12] And everything would just wirelessly communicate anyway.
[3902.46 → 3902.72] Yeah.
[3903.32 → 3904.22] So it's interesting.
[3905.06 → 3905.52] Could happen.
[3905.88 → 3906.62] Could happen.
[3906.80 → 3910.12] Maybe do you want to close out with how you're enjoying Google Glass and.
[3911.52 → 3911.76] Yeah.
[3911.76 → 3912.00] Yeah.
[3912.38 → 3914.96] So Glass is like a weird thing because.
[3914.96 → 3918.14] People don't have it yet.
[3918.28 → 3923.46] Like it's a conversation starter on one hand, but it's also like, what the hell is that on the other hand?
[3923.56 → 3924.30] Like what's on your face?
[3925.08 → 3930.38] So walking around with it, it's like you're focused on other things besides actually using it.
[3930.62 → 3936.66] But like actually sitting down and messing with the functionality, like it's really promising at its core.
[3936.66 → 3943.16] And then there's a bunch of other things in, you know, the Explorer community where people are developing apps for it.
[3943.58 → 3945.00] And I think that's the most exciting part.
[3945.26 → 3948.28] So I'm messing around with different apps that are in their store now.
[3948.62 → 3950.22] Or not even really a store, just a community.
[3950.86 → 3955.44] And that's given like way more perspective on like how Glass could be used in the future.
[3955.60 → 3956.88] So I like it.
[3957.42 → 3960.14] It's not an everyday, all the time, everywhere thing.
[3960.20 → 3961.24] Like some people are using it.
[3961.24 → 3965.46] But I think it's really promising when you look at the apps that people are making for it.
[3966.16 → 3966.20] Right.
[3966.28 → 3972.50] So much like iPhone where half of the crap that people were doing with it, Apple had no idea that was going to happen.
[3973.22 → 3973.34] Yeah.
[3973.44 → 3973.58] Right.
[3974.70 → 3975.82] So at what point?
[3976.08 → 3976.52] Sorry, go ahead.
[3976.80 → 3978.72] I was going to say it kind of forces an app store.
[3978.84 → 3981.30] Like you have to have an app store for Glass or no one's going to want it.
[3981.30 → 3981.94] Yeah.
[3982.46 → 3988.46] When will Glass or a further iteration be ready for prime time in your mind?
[3989.24 → 3989.60] Hmm.
[3991.02 → 3991.86] Hard to say.
[3992.46 → 3995.80] I would guess as soon as the app store is ready.
[3995.92 → 4000.40] I mean, the current hardware, I'm the least creative person when it comes to that.
[4000.52 → 4002.20] Like I think it's fine on my face now.
[4002.30 → 4005.24] I can't think of any improvements to make to it.
[4005.28 → 4006.86] Maybe a bigger battery would be nice.
[4006.96 → 4008.12] But how could you do that?
[4008.14 → 4008.74] I don't really know.
[4008.74 → 4019.78] So I think as soon as the app store is beefy enough, as soon as the initial selection is compelling enough for people to try it, then that's when it'll be ready.
[4020.18 → 4023.24] So you feel like the hardware is pretty much ready for you to drop?
[4023.28 → 4025.70] I mean, let's say it didn't cost over $1,000.
[4026.10 → 4027.56] Let's say it cost $300.
[4028.84 → 4032.12] Would you be ready to drop $300 on it with a mature app store?
[4032.92 → 4033.30] Yes.
[4034.78 → 4035.18] Interesting.
[4035.40 → 4036.28] Just for my use, yeah.
[4036.28 → 4036.32] Yeah.
[4036.64 → 4041.22] And I think that's a very limited group of people who would say yes, but I'd be one of those yeses.
[4042.34 → 4042.88] All right.
[4042.96 → 4044.70] Well, I think that pretty much wraps it up.
[4044.80 → 4046.42] Thank you so much for joining us.
[4046.48 → 4053.20] And for those of the viewers who were not watching when you first introduced yourself, please do plug all of your stuff.
[4053.44 → 4057.54] Unfortunately, my lower third that was supposed to have you in it was missing today.
[4057.54 → 4064.98] So make sure that anyone here who's not already following you on YouTube and Twitter and Google Plus and all those good places knows where to find you.
[4065.48 → 4065.68] All right.
[4065.72 → 4071.86] So you can find me first and foremost on the YouTube's, which would be YouTube.com slash MKBHD.
[4071.86 → 4074.82] And then everything else revolves around that.
[4075.24 → 4077.78] So Twitter.com slash MKBHD.
[4078.28 → 4080.50] Facebook.com slash MKBHD.
[4081.14 → 4084.92] Google Plus, it's actually Google.com slash plus Marquez Brownlee.
[4085.00 → 4086.80] But you can search MKBHD and find me anyway.
[4086.80 → 4091.36] So if you want to search or follow me anywhere, just those five letters, that's it.
[4092.92 → 4093.32] Fashion.
[4093.94 → 4096.66] I was going for fantastic and fascinating at the same time.
[4096.66 → 4097.02] Fascinating.
[4098.34 → 4098.70] Smashing.
[4098.78 → 4099.64] It's been a long week.
[4099.96 → 4100.22] All right.
[4100.28 → 4101.32] Thank you so much, man.
[4101.44 → 4102.86] Really appreciate you joining us.
[4102.88 → 4104.10] And I hope you'll do it again sometime.
[4104.50 → 4104.66] Yeah.
[4104.68 → 4105.20] Thanks for having me.
[4105.64 → 4105.88] All right.
[4105.92 → 4106.24] Take care.
[4106.50 → 4106.78] Take care.
[4109.30 → 4110.16] All right, guys.
[4110.26 → 4113.66] So that was Marcus Brownlee, YouTuber extraordinaire.
[4113.66 → 4119.42] Don't tell him I told you this, but he keeps an archive of all the videos he's ever uploaded
[4119.42 → 4120.12] on his channel.
[4120.50 → 4123.34] And man, some of that early stuff is pretty funny.
[4124.16 → 4124.70] Like, there's like...
[4124.70 → 4124.98] So is yours.
[4125.78 → 4126.24] No, no.
[4126.30 → 4127.42] His is like hilarious.
[4127.54 → 4132.06] There's like him as like a young teenager, like working on his golf swing and stuff.
[4132.36 → 4132.84] No, no.
[4132.88 → 4133.96] It's like, it's fantastic.
[4134.30 → 4136.68] So go back, go through some of that stuff.
[4136.72 → 4137.22] It's hilarious.
[4137.22 → 4142.94] What I really liked about digging through some of his video archive is how far he's come
[4142.94 → 4145.90] and how he continues to evolve what he's doing.
[4146.08 → 4147.28] I get a lot of questions.
[4147.50 → 4148.48] How do I be a YouTuber?
[4148.92 → 4150.98] How do I get big on social media?
[4151.06 → 4151.86] How do I do this?
[4152.02 → 4158.88] And I think he is probably an A++ example of how it is done without support.
[4159.04 → 4160.44] Because I kind of lucked out.
[4161.08 → 4162.70] I'm going to be completely honest.
[4163.10 → 4165.66] I lucked into this in a lot of ways.
[4165.66 → 4171.48] I had access to the hardware before I had to draw people in with a personality and with
[4171.48 → 4174.44] a show structure and all those other things that go along with it.
[4174.58 → 4176.32] At least I had the gear.
[4176.64 → 4178.08] He had to do it without it.
[4178.38 → 4179.66] So check it out.
[4180.12 → 4181.18] Very, very interesting.
[4181.96 → 4186.14] So let's move into our first post-Marcus topic here.
[4186.14 → 4191.94] We actually kind of jumped around a little bit beforehand because of some of the random
[4191.94 → 4192.36] problems.
[4192.46 → 4193.36] So what do you want to start with?
[4193.46 → 4196.92] Why don't we go with GTA 5.
[4197.06 → 4199.60] It costs a metric butt ton to make.
[4200.00 → 4203.26] So this was posted on the Linus Tech Tips Forum by Mucus.
[4204.26 → 4209.20] Sometimes I wish this guy wouldn't post so many news articles because I can't figure out
[4209.20 → 4209.36] how to pronounce it.
[4209.36 → 4213.64] He should add like a phonetic version for us because I also can't say his name.
[4214.06 → 4214.86] Location Finland.
[4214.86 → 4216.00] I mean that explains it.
[4216.26 → 4218.42] I wonder if it's like M. Mucus.
[4219.02 → 4224.60] So GTA 5 is the most expensive video game ever.
[4225.20 → 4229.12] So this graph right here, if you guys check out the forum thread, don't forget we upload
[4229.12 → 4234.48] the document once the show's over, shows that GTA 4 was actually the next most expensive
[4234.48 → 4244.28] at under $100 million budget with GTA 5 clocking in at an enormous, more than $250 million.
[4244.86 → 4251.52] So by comparison, Microsoft is spending $50 to $60 million on something like Halo 3.
[4252.42 → 4256.48] Half-Life per episode costs a paltry $10 million or so.
[4256.48 → 4261.10] This is one massive, massive game.
[4261.10 → 4271.84] One thing I like is a debate that came up a lot when I was younger, and I don't hear as much lately was the video gaming industry versus film industry.
[4271.84 → 4275.22] Because when I was younger, video gaming industry wasn't like bigger.
[4276.16 → 4277.82] And they were still kind of emerging.
[4278.40 → 4287.12] And now when you have games like GTA 5 coming in, in like the Uber high ranks of cost to produce that movies have.
[4287.80 → 4289.34] Like holy cow.
[4289.44 → 4291.62] That debate is just so one-sided now.
[4291.62 → 4293.18] The world is changing.
[4293.36 → 4299.46] I mean we're going to go to, so the original articles that were cited here are vrzone.com and wccftech.com.
[4299.78 → 4300.62] So check this out.
[4301.08 → 4307.76] This is major high-budget blockbuster Hollywood films that GTA 5 is being compared against now.
[4308.10 → 4311.62] Pirates of the Caribbean 3 is the only one that is higher.
[4311.62 → 4320.42] So it costs more than Tangled, John Carter, Harry Potter 6, Avatar Chronicles of Narnia, Avengers Inception, How to Train Your Dragon Fast 6, and Iron Legacy.
[4320.92 → 4332.62] Now something that actually, this was a good point that Easel, or formerly known as Diesel, made is if what you notice about those movies, there's a bit of a pattern there, all very CGI heavy.
[4333.26 → 4333.52] Yep.
[4333.84 → 4334.96] All very CGI heavy.
[4335.06 → 4335.54] It's hard to do.
[4335.84 → 4337.56] Because it's hard to do, and it's expensive.
[4337.56 → 4352.66] So with graphics moving towards a more CGI-like quality and more film-like storytelling, all those big budget things like writers and actors and CGI, I mean it's basically becoming the same thing.
[4352.66 → 4353.06] Yeah, yeah.
[4353.22 → 4363.34] And like especially certain games that are coming out that are honestly, like we went through action and action adventure and a lot of more, I'm not calling out action and action adventure games,
[4363.34 → 4369.38] but a lot of those are leaning this certain ones, are leaning towards this way where it's almost more of a story.
[4369.56 → 4380.36] Like there's certain video games where I've enjoyed it thoroughly because the gameplay is great and my mom and dad have been able to watch and been interested the entire time because it's almost a movie.
[4381.08 → 4384.92] So when's the first IMAX theatre getting a controller in it?
[4385.20 → 4385.50] Right?
[4386.14 → 4386.66] Right?
[4387.08 → 4387.80] Like...
[4387.80 → 4391.78] At what point do we actually start just having movies be interactive?
[4391.78 → 4392.34] I...
[4392.34 → 4402.86] And like with all these 3D viewing and super, super, superfast screens, I wonder if you could go to an interactive movie with controllers at each seat wearing glasses that gives you a different view of the screen.
[4404.06 → 4404.42] Boom.
[4404.72 → 4405.56] Who knows?
[4405.66 → 4410.04] Or I mean, or you could go to a theatre just for the experience of like the great sound.
[4410.28 → 4410.48] Yeah.
[4410.56 → 4414.08] And you could just be sitting there wearing your Google Glass and actually watching the movie like that.
[4414.98 → 4415.78] Or whatever.
[4416.28 → 4420.02] Whatever iteration of Google Glass that is, which would probably be slightly different, but still.
[4420.20 → 4420.78] Yeah, definitely.
[4420.78 → 4423.06] Yeah, entertainment is definitely changing.
[4423.18 → 4427.94] Speaking of entertainment changing, PS Vita, does anyone care?
[4428.42 → 4429.26] Now, now, okay.
[4429.52 → 4432.14] When I first started reading this, I was with you.
[4432.62 → 4433.16] Okay, fine.
[4433.16 → 4433.66] Does anyone care?
[4433.76 → 4433.98] Why?
[4434.26 → 4435.98] Then I thought about it a little bit more.
[4436.40 → 4437.32] They're releasing all this stuff.
[4437.40 → 4438.32] PS4 is coming out.
[4438.44 → 4440.08] This is going to be bundled.
[4440.56 → 4443.14] All the stuff that PS4 and Vita can tie in with.
[4443.14 → 4447.22] Pacifica posted this on the forum and the original articles from The Verge, which is awesome.
[4447.34 → 4451.50] I'll keep pimping The Verge as long as they're around, especially now that Marcus is on there.
[4451.50 → 4452.48] I actually haven't seen that.
[4452.58 → 4452.84] So anyway.
[4453.26 → 4453.82] Okay, fine.
[4453.88 → 4455.08] So you think it'll be bundled?
[4455.08 → 4462.70] I think it'll be bundled because another thing that kind of helps my theory on this is if you look at the price point of a PS4, it's $100 cheaper.
[4462.70 → 4467.70] With a bundled PS Vita, they might be able to make it around the same price.
[4467.80 → 4472.44] But if they don't do a hard bundle, because they've already announced it's $399 for a PS4.
[4472.78 → 4473.26] That's done.
[4473.34 → 4473.80] That's over.
[4473.94 → 4474.10] Oh, yeah.
[4474.10 → 4483.10] So if they don't do a hard bundle and make it a $499 SKU and completely abandon PS4 as standalone, then...
[4483.72 → 4486.02] I think you'll be able to purchase either.
[4486.16 → 4487.78] What development is going to be done for it?
[4487.90 → 4488.58] Because you look at...
[4488.58 → 4490.44] They're forcing certain games to be able to...
[4490.44 → 4493.66] Isn't it like all games have to be able to be pushed to a PS Vita?
[4494.42 → 4494.88] Let's...
[4494.88 → 4495.62] Here.
[4495.74 → 4496.40] Let's bring up the thing.
[4497.08 → 4500.12] So if you can push the games to it, then great.
[4500.26 → 4508.12] But I'd be very surprised if you have the same level of integration as what Nintendo's doing with Wii U, where they're just allowing...
[4508.12 → 4509.12] Where they're just basically...
[4509.12 → 4513.24] They're saying, no matter what Wii U you have, it's always going to be...
[4513.24 → 4516.04] It's always going to have that secondary screen and that secondary controller.
[4516.46 → 4518.12] Whereas this is...
[4518.12 → 4520.18] It's additional functionality.
[4520.18 → 4520.78] Optional.
[4521.14 → 4521.44] It is.
[4521.64 → 4522.62] And I don't think...
[4522.62 → 4525.42] Like, you're saying, I think that you'd have to buy this bundle.
[4525.52 → 4526.90] I think it's going to be an available bundle.
[4527.24 → 4528.34] You can still buy a standalone.
[4528.60 → 4530.50] Okay, would you use it, I guess, is another question.
[4530.56 → 4533.98] Because Microsoft has tried to do this with their whatever glass...
[4533.98 → 4534.92] Whatever they were calling it.
[4534.96 → 4535.48] Smart Glass.
[4536.88 → 4537.90] Nintendo's tried to do it.
[4538.16 → 4540.12] And the Wii U has been a colossal failure.
[4540.12 → 4545.12] But Smart Glass, a lot of that has been like adding a mini-map, which is ridiculous.
[4545.12 → 4546.58] And adding whatever else, which is ridiculous.
[4546.58 → 4551.88] And the fact that there's no adoption of Windows 8 and Windows RT on tablets.
[4552.00 → 4556.34] And Wii U has been, quote-unquote, a failure, but for, I think, other reasons.
[4556.50 → 4557.50] And we've seen a trend.
[4557.72 → 4562.06] It hasn't been a failure because of this...
[4562.06 → 4564.42] It's a wacky controller that a lot of people are not used to.
[4564.56 → 4568.34] But it's mandatory because you get it when you buy the device and that's the only option.
[4568.34 → 4569.74] And I don't think this will be the only option.
[4570.02 → 4572.92] And yes, I would use it for the same reason that I would use something like Shield.
[4574.26 → 4574.86] Okay, yeah.
[4575.06 → 4576.46] Okay, game streaming, good.
[4576.96 → 4578.98] Dual screen, I'm going to go ahead and say bad.
[4579.10 → 4579.86] I don't think...
[4579.86 → 4580.80] Is that a thing?
[4581.58 → 4584.48] If, like, using it as, like, a mini-map or using it as whatever else...
[4584.48 → 4585.98] No cares about that at all.
[4585.98 → 4586.58] No cares about that at all.
[4586.58 → 4587.14] Like, zero.
[4587.38 → 4588.14] Because that's...
[4588.14 → 4589.76] In my opinion, that's completely ridiculous.
[4589.76 → 4594.28] Unless you're wearing, like, head-mounted gear so it goes off an arm and sits right here.
[4594.50 → 4596.26] A mini-map is not going to be helpful.
[4596.66 → 4597.92] Or any kind of dual screen.
[4597.92 → 4598.92] Yeah, like...
[4598.92 → 4605.74] I mean, anything where you're focusing on something that's on a different plane in order to look between them, there is a delay.
[4605.86 → 4609.66] Like, if you guys do that, if you play the hands are close to my face or far away from my face game,
[4609.68 → 4616.36] you can actually calculate, much like your camera's autofocus, how long it takes to focus on something that's close or far away from you.
[4616.42 → 4618.20] So I think something like that will make no sense.
[4618.28 → 4623.54] However, if it's a controller and PS4 can stream to it, then I guess it's moderately interesting.
[4623.96 → 4626.38] But, I mean, Shield's already here doing it better.
[4626.38 → 4630.34] I don't think it's that big of a deal, but I understand why it came to be.
[4630.44 → 4634.58] Because when I first started looking at this, I was like, why does this exist at all?
[4635.04 → 4635.22] Right.
[4635.22 → 4636.26] Like, what?
[4636.80 → 4641.16] But now I think I understand if that's the angle they're going with it.
[4641.16 → 4644.76] So we've got another article here speaking of changes to the gaming industry.
[4644.90 → 4652.56] This was posted by Top War Gamer, and it's a Kodak article predicting just doom and gloom for the gaming industry,
[4652.80 → 4654.84] at least from a hardware sales perspective.
[4654.84 → 4661.02] So it graphs, particularly Sony and Nintendo, it graphs Sony portable sales, Nintendo portable sales,
[4661.50 → 4663.84] Sony consoles, and Nintendo consoles.
[4664.02 → 4668.74] And there's this horrible, like, devastating-looking graph of the total units sold,
[4668.80 → 4671.98] and it goes back all the way to 2007.
[4672.22 → 4675.24] Q1 2007 all the way to Q2 2013.
[4675.24 → 4684.54] I think this is probably one of the most, okay, I think this is probably one of the most deceptive articles that I've ever read,
[4684.62 → 4688.72] because the I mean, the article even acknowledges it.
[4688.80 → 4694.02] It's like, sales tend to be bigger at this time of year, and, you know, there might be some new consoles.
[4694.02 → 4701.56] But the author is not too hopeful PS4 and Xbox One will do better than refreshes like Wii U, 3DS, 3DS XL, and Vita.
[4701.88 → 4704.00] I think he's totally wrong about that, personally.
[4704.22 → 4704.62] Totally.
[4704.88 → 4706.68] Like, 100% completely off the wall.
[4706.80 → 4708.80] As wrong as wrong can be.
[4708.94 → 4709.18] Yeah.
[4709.72 → 4713.64] Xbox One, PS4, whichever one ends up winning this generation of console war,
[4713.66 → 4715.90] and I'm going to go out on a limb, I'm going to call Xbox One here.
[4716.22 → 4717.02] I think they'll win.
[4717.26 → 4718.78] We had a discussion about this the other day.
[4718.78 → 4727.06] I think Xbox One will win, but not by the margin that Xbox One, oh my goodness, WON against,
[4727.56 → 4734.64] jeez, against PS3, because, Xbox 360 won against PS3, yeah.
[4735.46 → 4740.70] Because I think PS4 has a lot more hype, and will close the gap up.
[4740.76 → 4746.48] So it might be a quote-unquote win, but in my opinion, the battle was not lost.
[4746.48 → 4749.36] Will not be lost, I guess, the fight hasn't even started yet.
[4749.54 → 4750.02] But, yeah.
[4751.28 → 4752.06] I guess we'll see.
[4752.60 → 4758.58] All right, so speaking of things that run games, we're actually, guys, hit us for a Twitter blitz.
[4758.66 → 4762.96] We're going to do a Twitter blitz, just with normal Twitter questions.
[4763.10 → 4764.36] Anything goes for this one.
[4764.68 → 4766.72] But let's move into our next topic here.
[4766.82 → 4768.48] So BrownNinja97 says,
[4768.48 → 4773.60] AMD Volcanic Islands GPUs are going to be going through a name change.
[4773.68 → 4775.68] They are going to be the R200 series.
[4775.90 → 4779.22] The original article was posted on Tom's hardware, and quite frankly,
[4779.66 → 4783.80] I've seen a lot of freaking confusing product names.
[4784.16 → 4786.34] I have never seen anything this bad.
[4786.34 → 4792.28] So Radeon HD 7000 is what we're working on now.
[4792.70 → 4795.26] And AMD, or not what we're working on, what we have now.
[4795.76 → 4800.00] And AMD has unabashedly mixed things up in the past.
[4800.10 → 4802.36] We went from the dual GPU card, okay?
[4802.74 → 4814.34] Went from 3870X2 to 4870X2 to 5970, I believe, to 6990 to 7990.
[4814.34 → 4816.24] Or something stupid like that.
[4816.30 → 4818.26] Like, I can't even remember which ones changed in one.
[4818.56 → 4819.00] Why?
[4819.52 → 4820.40] Why are you doing this?
[4820.42 → 4822.84] Anyway, so now they're simplifying it further.
[4823.06 → 4827.46] So it's going to be AMD Radeon R9 and then three digits.
[4829.44 → 4829.88] Why?
[4829.98 → 4831.06] Why even have the R9?
[4831.26 → 4835.36] The R9 literally, like, I understand where they're coming from.
[4835.42 → 4836.34] It was supposed to be an oversimplification.
[4837.06 → 4843.64] But it was way too far oversimplified to the point where it's just 100% redundant.
[4843.64 → 4845.04] R9 will be high-end.
[4845.18 → 4846.54] R8 will be mid-range.
[4846.76 → 4848.96] R7, or, sorry, mid to high-end.
[4849.30 → 4853.86] So the numbers will go down much like the way that their APU naming schemes go.
[4854.32 → 4858.16] But then, like, why not use something similar to what the Apus are using,
[4858.24 → 4860.46] where you have the A10 four digits and suffix?
[4860.46 → 4868.42] So no, instead, they've gone with the R whatever and then three digits and no suffix.
[4868.92 → 4874.36] And another problem with this is it really doesn't leave much room to iterate.
[4874.36 → 4879.14] I mean, once you introduce the product line, what if you want to slot something in between,
[4879.28 → 4882.84] like what they've done with the 7790, for example,
[4883.42 → 4886.66] where having more digits, I guess, in spite of it being kind of confusing
[4886.66 → 4891.04] and meaning nothing to consumers, at least it gave you that flexibility.
[4891.28 → 4896.44] I mean, this to me is as bad or worse than Intel's star concept.
[4896.86 → 4897.94] You remember star concept?
[4898.18 → 4898.98] Star concept.
[4898.98 → 4903.04] Yeah, if it performed better, it just had, like, more stars under it.
[4903.70 → 4904.02] Yeah.
[4905.28 → 4905.60] Yeah.
[4906.76 → 4909.42] Where it's, like, it's simplifying it to the point where it just doesn't mean it.
[4909.44 → 4911.70] Can we just go back to, like, gigahertz or something?
[4911.84 → 4913.18] Or, like, I don't know.
[4913.24 → 4915.32] I mean, if you're going to have, like, a stupid naming scheme,
[4915.38 → 4917.26] you might as well just do it in 3D marks.
[4917.58 → 4922.44] This is the Radeon Vantage whatever score it gets.
[4922.50 → 4923.18] Like, I don't know.
[4923.24 → 4923.88] That would have been funny.
[4924.00 → 4926.82] They could have, when I first, I skimmed this article,
[4926.82 → 4929.54] wrote notes for it, and then went to go move on.
[4929.60 → 4931.28] Before I went and moved on, I was like, oh, wait, what?
[4931.48 → 4934.14] Because I didn't actually notice the R series thing.
[4934.20 → 4935.98] I just noticed the three numbers after it.
[4936.04 → 4936.20] Yeah.
[4936.30 → 4938.28] So my thing on the article was, oh, yeah,
[4938.30 → 4941.32] they just took a leaf from NVIDIA's book and went to three digits.
[4941.44 → 4943.10] And then I was like, wait, why are those things there?
[4943.40 → 4945.02] What do those mean?
[4945.02 → 4946.94] Because at first I thought it was just like, yeah,
[4947.06 → 4948.78] this was the Radeon 9000 series.
[4948.92 → 4949.78] Now it is this.
[4949.98 → 4952.16] And I was like, oh, those are in the same.
[4952.58 → 4952.98] What?
[4953.64 → 4954.12] Why?
[4954.46 → 4954.82] Why?
[4955.48 → 4955.82] Why?
[4955.82 → 4956.14] Why?
[4956.40 → 4957.50] So, I don't know.
[4957.72 → 4961.82] I mean, at the end of the day, the people who care are going to do the research
[4961.82 → 4964.68] and find out how they perform in the benchmarks in the games that they play,
[4964.74 → 4966.40] and they're going to buy whatever makes the most sense.
[4966.52 → 4970.08] But I would have really preferred to see something a little bit less confusing
[4970.08 → 4972.18] if they could have possibly done that.
[4972.20 → 4972.90] Just don't get it.
[4974.26 → 4979.52] Speaking of AMD, they've added Saints Row 4 to the Never Settle bundle.
[4979.86 → 4981.32] So it's in the gold tier.
[4981.44 → 4982.28] Go ahead and switch.
[4982.28 → 4984.20] So that was in a non-tech article over there.
[4984.20 → 4991.74] So Never Settle, they said outright that they are going to be having games be added to it
[4991.74 → 4993.00] before the end of the year.
[4993.30 → 4995.74] And if you've bought something like a Radeon 7970 or...
[4995.74 → 4996.44] Is there something out there?
[4996.86 → 4998.36] Yeah, I have to go for a quick sec.
[4998.48 → 4999.18] Oh, okay.
[4999.32 → 4999.58] Sorry.
[4999.80 → 5000.34] I'll be right back.
[5000.34 → 5000.58] Okay.
[5000.58 → 5002.42] So if you have something like...
[5002.42 → 5009.36] If you bought something like a 7970 or 7950, while Never Settle Forever was implemented,
[5009.70 → 5011.56] you could actually choose the games you wanted.
[5011.74 → 5016.50] And they said, you can keep your codes in reserve until the end of this year,
[5016.56 → 5017.54] and we're going to add more games.
[5017.62 → 5022.02] So they have announced Never Settle Forever gold tier, includes Saints Row 4,
[5022.20 → 5023.38] which is very, very cool.
[5023.38 → 5028.32] And if you guys have been watching Radeon card pricing, even if you haven't been paying attention
[5028.32 → 5032.74] to any of the news about the upcoming Volcanic Islands GPUs, you should probably know about
[5032.74 → 5037.80] them because we're seeing 7970s under 300, 7950s at like $200.
[5038.32 → 5045.18] It is a great time to buy a graphics card because those are still excellent, excellent GPUs and
[5045.18 → 5050.36] are very capable of running pretty much anything that you could throw at them.
[5050.36 → 5055.44] So let's go ahead and do that Twitter blitz since Slick has abandoned me here anyway.
[5055.64 → 5057.20] So I guess I'll talk to you guys.
[5057.26 → 5057.80] Hi, everybody.
[5058.58 → 5060.66] I guess I could fire up Twitch chat as well.
[5061.06 → 5063.10] Someone says Intel is only good for porn?
[5063.74 → 5065.32] I don't even know what that means.
[5066.78 → 5068.12] He's leaving for round two.
[5068.20 → 5071.04] If you want a good price for a lot of the market, AMD is the way to go.
[5071.50 → 5072.56] He has to wet his hickey.
[5072.62 → 5073.26] It hurts, apparently.
[5073.40 → 5073.64] Okay.
[5073.82 → 5076.12] So let's go ahead and move into some of the Twitter blitzes.
[5076.12 → 5078.82] Can you use dual six-pin Y-chord?
[5078.82 → 5082.06] So not two eight-pins from a different Corsair power supply if it fit the connector?
[5082.20 → 5083.86] No, not necessarily.
[5084.10 → 5087.90] I would check with Corsair before doing anything like that because they are not necessarily
[5087.90 → 5089.02] interoperable.
[5089.56 → 5091.32] Slick, we know you've owned the Galaxy Nexus.
[5091.78 → 5093.32] Are you excited about the Nexus 5?
[5093.42 → 5094.82] Sorry, he's not here, unfortunately.
[5095.46 → 5097.82] Will my 3570K be bottleneck 2780s?
[5098.42 → 5102.16] Well, if it did, there's not a lot you can do because particularly once you overclock
[5102.16 → 5105.10] that CPU, there's not a lot you can get that's faster than it.
[5105.38 → 5107.02] So, yeah.
[5107.26 → 5110.18] Turn up your graphics settings until the video cards become the bottleneck.
[5110.62 → 5112.16] My brother is interested in PC gaming.
[5112.26 → 5116.84] Would you recommend an APU-based system or a system with a low-end graphics card and CPU?
[5118.12 → 5119.38] Really depends on the budget.
[5119.62 → 5124.82] Get an APU if you can't afford a graphics card that's at least $100 to $120.
[5125.24 → 5128.96] That's where you really start getting like a decent price to performance ratio.
[5129.46 → 5130.26] This is for Slick.
[5130.36 → 5131.04] Oh, man.
[5131.14 → 5132.44] All the Slick thing.
[5132.52 → 5137.02] I'm pretty sure he's going to say Ducky Shine 3, and I'm pretty sure he's going to say
[5137.02 → 5142.42] blue switches, but the ASUS sound cards have a known buzzing noise on their mic inputs
[5142.42 → 5145.08] and the problem has been addressed for years and still not fixed.
[5145.20 → 5145.40] Okay.
[5146.70 → 5150.24] Actually, we've got an unboxing coming soon of the Fido E10.
[5150.44 → 5154.46] So, we will be beginning to acknowledge some of the other options that are out there.
[5154.46 → 5159.88] One of the things that I haven't really done much of in the past because I tended not to
[5159.88 → 5160.52] sell.
[5160.82 → 5164.00] Like Marcus was saying earlier, it's one of the ways that he's able to always have the
[5164.00 → 5169.20] latest gear is to buy it and then flip it before too much time has passed and then use
[5169.20 → 5170.72] that money to buy again.
[5171.24 → 5172.76] So, we're going to be starting to do that.
[5172.86 → 5177.56] We're using some of the I mean, between me and sort of the thousands of people watching
[5177.56 → 5178.64] this, by the way, you guys are awesome.
[5178.74 → 5179.40] Thank you for watching.
[5180.12 → 5184.60] I've been a little bit tight for money since we started Linus Media Group and one of the
[5184.60 → 5189.54] things that we did with the first blood campaign on the forum was we covered the costs that
[5189.54 → 5196.14] the forum has hit us with since we started it and then because you guys were so generous,
[5196.64 → 5201.78] we exceeded that, and we've created a slush fund that we're going to use to buy stuff that
[5201.78 → 5206.26] we otherwise wouldn't have access to so we can bring you content about stuff that we otherwise
[5206.26 → 5207.12] wouldn't be able to do.
[5207.26 → 5211.98] So, we're not just locked into motherboards forever or whatever else and I haven't talked
[5211.98 → 5215.92] to him about this yet, but I want to figure out if there's a way that we can build like
[5215.92 → 5221.04] a Reddit type upvoting module for what you guys want to be the next thing you want us
[5221.04 → 5227.08] to buy with that slush fund which we would then unbox, overview and then sell through the
[5227.08 → 5228.94] Linus Tech Tips forum at a discounted rate.
[5228.94 → 5235.94] So, something like that could be a very cool way to crowd fund our videos so to speak and
[5235.94 → 5240.06] that's sort of the direction that I'm headed for the future and I just wanted to share
[5240.06 → 5240.80] that with you guys.
[5240.80 → 5241.94] I actually think that's feasible.
[5242.20 → 5243.02] That should probably be okay.
[5243.46 → 5244.26] So, what do you think?
[5244.32 → 5245.08] Don't commit to them.
[5245.82 → 5247.14] Rule number one of being a dev.
[5247.40 → 5249.88] I said that might be feasible.
[5250.42 → 5251.80] I didn't say...
[5251.80 → 5254.32] Good point.
[5254.32 → 5255.32] It's documented now.
[5257.18 → 5258.90] What do you think about PS Vita TV?
[5259.12 → 5261.18] Should Chromecast, OUA, Apple TV be worried?
[5261.90 → 5262.66] You know what?
[5262.72 → 5263.70] They're so different.
[5264.32 → 5268.04] I mean, Chromecast is basically a wireless HDMI dongle in my mind.
[5268.14 → 5269.60] That's all it really is.
[5270.02 → 5275.92] Apple TV is so tightly tied into their own ecosystem and is so seamless and so good.
[5276.02 → 5276.54] I have one.
[5276.60 → 5277.18] It's awesome.
[5277.70 → 5278.70] Like, it's just awesome.
[5279.24 → 5280.84] I don't think there's anything to be worried about.
[5280.84 → 5285.18] I mean, to me, the ones that are going to be real players are going to be the more open
[5285.18 → 5289.84] standards like Wide, where it can be implemented on any device with an Intel wireless solution.
[5290.28 → 5291.32] Okay, so it's not quite open.
[5292.22 → 5297.20] And on any TV that also uses an Intel wireless solution or something like Miracast.
[5297.38 → 5302.28] We saw a very, very low latency Miracast implementation when we were down at PAX.
[5302.36 → 5303.52] Did you see that in the Shield booth?
[5303.68 → 5303.88] Yeah.
[5305.28 → 5306.04] That's cool.
[5306.66 → 5308.92] So, stuff like that, to me, is more relevant.
[5309.92 → 5310.70] You know what?
[5310.70 → 5312.04] I was even going to say this.
[5312.72 → 5317.28] Inkerman is like, they should have just called it, like, the Radeon 9000 Pro and just
[5317.28 → 5317.94] done a reboot.
[5319.04 → 5320.46] Agree, 100%.
[5320.46 → 5321.68] That's what they should have done.
[5321.70 → 5322.32] That would have been interesting.
[5323.08 → 5324.86] Did anyone get prizes from the WD giveaway?
[5325.14 → 5326.28] No, not yet.
[5326.44 → 5331.38] We actually just heard back from the last winner, and WD wanted us to submit all the winners
[5331.38 → 5333.52] so they could ship everything out in one fell swoop.
[5333.72 → 5334.72] They sent a follow-up today.
[5335.04 → 5338.26] So, we need to get them that finalized list maybe by the end of the day today, and let's
[5338.26 → 5338.76] get that going.
[5338.76 → 5341.06] Sion Ray is, I believe, one of the winners.
[5341.38 → 5342.56] So, I think that's why he's asking.
[5342.72 → 5345.66] Someone asked why would you pick Xbox One over PS4?
[5345.74 → 5352.02] Because I actually believe that their broader ecosystem implementation is going to win.
[5352.46 → 5355.78] I think that TV is going to be a thing for a while still.
[5355.78 → 5361.62] I think he's picking them as the person who's probably going to sell more.
[5361.74 → 5362.38] I don't think...
[5362.38 → 5363.76] Yeah, I wouldn't buy either of them.
[5363.76 → 5364.00] No.
[5364.24 → 5364.58] So, whatever.
[5365.20 → 5367.36] I don't think either of us are probably going to buy one.
[5367.42 → 5371.84] I won't buy one at least until they come up with the next iteration, like an Xbox Elite
[5371.84 → 5374.22] or a PS4 Slim or whatever they end up doing.
[5374.22 → 5378.68] That will be the first time I even start maybe possibly looking at them.
[5378.68 → 5380.92] Same thing.
[5380.98 → 5382.06] Would you ever review this?
[5382.22 → 5383.08] It really depends.
[5383.30 → 5386.06] It depends on what the community wants to see us do.
[5386.90 → 5388.86] Will an 1100T bottleneck a 7950?
[5388.96 → 5389.76] Yeah, in some cases.
[5390.02 → 5390.18] Yeah.
[5390.70 → 5392.40] But everything bottlenecks.
[5392.82 → 5394.16] Is there going to be an after party tonight?
[5394.16 → 5395.90] Probably not.
[5396.38 → 5401.06] But I might do a game stream tonight or something once I'm finished making dinner.
[5401.22 → 5403.44] Because that's the new thing is I'm supposed to make dinner on Fridays.
[5403.92 → 5404.48] Oh, wow.
[5404.74 → 5404.98] Yeah.
[5405.98 → 5406.42] Yeah.
[5406.58 → 5407.22] Oh, oh.
[5407.34 → 5408.66] Speaking of changes.
[5409.72 → 5410.94] We got your feedback.
[5411.24 → 5412.48] We read you loud and clear.
[5412.76 → 5414.74] You want a long show on Friday.
[5415.82 → 5416.26] Okay.
[5418.26 → 5418.92] Got it.
[5419.00 → 5419.42] Got it.
[5419.86 → 5421.94] The WAN show is not going anywhere.
[5422.56 → 5422.92] All right.
[5422.92 → 5428.80] So with that out of the way, a lot of people have requested that we do smaller shows throughout
[5428.80 → 5429.22] the week.
[5429.30 → 5432.26] So I think that's going to be something we're going to implement maybe when I get back from
[5432.26 → 5432.70] my trip.
[5433.24 → 5435.16] So I'll be gone for a couple of weeks.
[5435.74 → 5436.34] Don't worry.
[5436.42 → 5437.62] We're filming lots of content.
[5437.82 → 5440.80] There will still be one to two videos a day while I'm gone.
[5440.88 → 5442.16] So I'm like dying right now.
[5442.48 → 5448.74] But I want to do maybe a few shows a week and a longer WAN show on Friday so that we can
[5448.74 → 5451.88] bring you guys faster, shorter updates as things happen.
[5451.88 → 5456.38] But we can still do the more in-depth discussion and the guests as the Friday show.
[5457.38 → 5460.56] Have you seen a non-text review of Bay Trail from IDF?
[5460.66 → 5461.68] Best in class CPU.
[5461.90 → 5462.10] Okay.
[5462.54 → 5465.00] GPU with equal to ARM power consumption.
[5465.22 → 5465.60] Yes.
[5465.92 → 5471.52] In fact, that is one of our topics is there's some really exciting stuff going on at IDF.
[5471.52 → 5477.62] And we're going to close up with that before we finish up with our forum news and all that
[5477.62 → 5478.10] good stuff.
[5478.44 → 5480.94] I don't think VGA has a Hadron in the mail to us.
[5481.00 → 5482.66] I think right now they're very, very allocated.
[5482.86 → 5485.82] So I'm not expecting too much right now.
[5486.42 → 5487.70] Slick, do you mind checking?
[5487.84 → 5491.22] Oh, someone asked what's your favourite keyboard brand, I think, or something like that.
[5491.26 → 5492.36] Or what's your favourite Ducky keyboard?
[5492.36 → 5494.78] It's not.
[5495.04 → 5495.52] Chime 3.
[5496.42 → 5496.90] Chime 3?
[5497.22 → 5497.44] Okay.
[5497.94 → 5500.86] Actually, we should probably do word from our sponsors.
[5501.12 → 5502.54] So Squarespace, guys.
[5502.84 → 5509.30] We actually redid the Linus Media Group website using Squarespace because that is a thing for
[5509.30 → 5514.84] us, is actually trying to use Squarespace before we really go, yeah, it's really easy to use,
[5514.90 → 5516.06] but we haven't actually tried it.
[5516.06 → 5519.62] So I'm going to go ahead and throw that up there for a limited time only.
[5519.74 → 5521.44] So this is only during September, guys.
[5521.52 → 5527.26] You can head over to squarespace.com, use offer code Linus9, and you can get 20% off on any
[5527.26 → 5529.86] of your first, on purchases on a new account.
[5530.06 → 5533.86] So let's go ahead and remember, guys, even if you already have a Squarespace account, if
[5533.86 → 5536.90] you, for whatever reason, needed another one or your mom needs one, you could definitely
[5536.90 → 5539.78] use our offer code, and it would definitely make us look good to our sponsors.
[5540.22 → 5544.28] They do a great job of providing, they've got over 20 templates that work, whether it's on
[5544.28 → 5549.38] a desktop, laptop, a mobile device, like a phone or a tablet or whatever the case may
[5549.38 → 5549.52] be.
[5549.60 → 5551.12] They scale, they stay beautiful.
[5551.24 → 5554.26] They've got a lot of different options, whether you want to make yourself a little boutique
[5554.26 → 5559.86] store, a website for your restaurant, if you wanted to make a website for your media company
[5559.86 → 5563.06] that you tried to do it on WordPress and its just kind of sucked.
[5563.46 → 5565.72] And anyway, so you guys can check that out.
[5565.82 → 5566.96] The navigation is easy.
[5567.06 → 5568.66] You can view the changes in real time.
[5568.78 → 5569.94] They handle all the hosting.
[5570.06 → 5570.68] It's all dynamic.
[5570.68 → 5575.94] In fact, let's test them on this because we have the lowest tier account.
[5576.16 → 5577.80] Guys, hit us.
[5578.62 → 5579.66] LinusMediaGroup.com.
[5579.74 → 5581.04] Let's see if we can take it down.
[5581.50 → 5585.18] And I have not planned this with them or scripted this in any way.
[5585.28 → 5588.30] So I'll be really interested to see what happens here.
[5588.72 → 5589.52] It's still loading.
[5589.52 → 5589.54] Wow.
[5589.68 → 5590.28] It's still loading.
[5590.28 → 5590.80] All right.
[5590.96 → 5591.40] Let's go ahead.
[5591.46 → 5592.74] Let's refresh it just for loss.
[5593.76 → 5595.00] It's still loading quickly.
[5595.14 → 5597.06] So they do offer scalable plans.
[5597.06 → 5602.26] So you can actually, as your website expands and gets more traffic, it shouldn't theoretically slow down.
[5602.32 → 5605.50] And we're hitting it with at least a few thousand people in all likelihood right now.
[5605.88 → 5608.82] We took down, we've taken down Noctua before.
[5609.02 → 5612.02] I took down Focus when I uploaded the unboxing.
[5614.54 → 5618.56] Their site was down for like a period of time after that unboxing went up.
[5618.56 → 5619.46] So there you go.
[5619.84 → 5624.38] LinusMediaGroup.com doesn't go down, apparently, even when it gets hit reasonably hard.
[5624.68 → 5627.58] So thank you, Squarespace, for being a sponsor of the show.
[5627.66 → 5631.80] And guys, just a reminder, Squarespace.com, offer code Linus9, 20% off.
[5631.86 → 5635.02] The normal offer is 10% off, so it's a pretty good deal this month.
[5635.60 → 5636.84] And Hotspot Shield.
[5636.96 → 5640.94] So guys, Hotspot Shield is a VPN solution that works on your desktop, works on your notebook,
[5641.16 → 5643.18] and can also work on your mobile devices.
[5643.18 → 5650.44] It has all the same benefits of a regular VPN solution, and that is to say that it obscures your true IP address
[5650.44 → 5653.32] from people who might otherwise be able to track you.
[5653.38 → 5657.36] Remember, your IP address contains a lot of information that you might not necessarily know,
[5657.70 → 5661.14] such as your location to sometimes within about a block away.
[5661.78 → 5667.14] It's quite possible to find out where someone is located just from knowing their IP address.
[5667.30 → 5669.70] So it does obscure that a fair bit.
[5669.78 → 5671.90] It also has some other interesting mobile features.
[5671.90 → 5676.70] So for example, on iOS platforms, it actually allows...
[5676.70 → 5680.16] So remember, guys, the way a VPN works is it goes through them to you.
[5680.30 → 5688.24] So on their side, they are actually compressing the data so that your mobile data plan will not have as much data consumed
[5688.24 → 5691.36] as if you were just connecting directly to whatever website it is.
[5691.66 → 5693.84] Now, your mileage may vary with stuff like this.
[5693.88 → 5697.62] It really depends on how compressible versus non-compressible the data is.
[5697.62 → 5705.64] Remember, highly compressed file formats are less compressible after the fact compared to ones that are very raw.
[5706.04 → 5709.74] And on the Internet, you tend to find a lot of highly compressed file formats.
[5710.14 → 5711.64] So just bear that in mind.
[5711.74 → 5715.32] We're not talking like, oh, my goodness, you're going to be able to do ten times as much web browsing.
[5715.32 → 5719.78] But every little bit counts, especially when you're on that last two days of the month, and you're like,
[5719.86 → 5723.88] oh, it would really be nice if I could load up a page right about now.
[5724.26 → 5725.02] I was in...
[5725.02 → 5728.82] I think it was a month ago our Internet was kind of screwed up, so I enabled my 3D.
[5728.98 → 5729.82] Gee, do you remember that?
[5729.90 → 5730.00] Yeah.
[5730.08 → 5730.66] I ran out of data.
[5731.06 → 5732.44] Well, I didn't run out of data.
[5732.56 → 5735.66] I have my limit 50 megabytes before it actually is.
[5735.66 → 5739.24] So I took off my limiter on the last few days and was like, oh, no.
[5739.40 → 5740.02] Oh, no.
[5740.50 → 5741.74] Living on the edge, man.
[5742.14 → 5743.48] You're living on the edge.
[5743.56 → 5744.02] Pretty much.
[5744.06 → 5744.60] I was scared.
[5744.88 → 5747.04] So anyway, guys, head over to that bit.ly.
[5747.16 → 5754.02] So it's bit.ly slash HS Share for up to 20% off if you use offer code Linus.
[5754.26 → 5758.46] So with that done now, let's head into our next topic.
[5758.72 → 5761.46] We have just hammered through these topics today.
[5761.98 → 5763.04] This has been an efficient show.
[5763.10 → 5764.16] Let's focus on Intel.
[5764.16 → 5765.76] So here we go.
[5766.12 → 5768.90] Haswell E is on demo already.
[5769.38 → 5771.76] This was posted by Snow Comet on the forum.
[5771.76 → 5776.52] So there's an Alien ware-esque looking machine with an NZXT water cooler in it.
[5776.58 → 5779.52] So apparently they're not going to change the mounting socket holes.
[5779.70 → 5781.90] At least they haven't yet.
[5782.14 → 5785.18] It is a DDR4 reference platform.
[5785.50 → 5789.36] So DDR4 is going to bring many of the same benefits as previous iterations of DDR.
[5789.50 → 5791.88] So that is lower power consumption, higher density, and higher speed.
[5791.88 → 5795.12] On the desktop, it doesn't matter much.
[5795.70 → 5805.50] But for servers where you can get billed by how many watts your server is using, and for servers where you need a ton of memory for virtual machines and all those kinds of things, this is a very big deal.
[5805.80 → 5806.86] But there you have it, guys.
[5806.86 → 5808.78] There are images of the motherboard.
[5810.00 → 5811.62] How excited are you for Haswell E?
[5813.82 → 5814.74] DDR4 and 8 cores.
[5815.66 → 5816.18] Okay, yeah.
[5816.40 → 5816.72] 8 cores.
[5816.92 → 5823.72] It's like, I read through all this, and I was like, there are a few things that I care about, and there's one thing that I really freaking care about, which is 8 cores.
[5823.72 → 5827.60] So the original article was from WCCF Tech, and yes.
[5827.60 → 5838.86] Because to me, the exciting thing about Ivy Bridge E was the possibility that maybe there would be an 8 core Extreme Edition variant, or even like an 8 core K.
[5839.26 → 5840.20] That would be sweet.
[5840.20 → 5840.48] Whoa.
[5840.80 → 5840.94] Right.
[5841.12 → 5846.84] That would push performance forward in some of the things that we do here, even though for things like gaming, maybe not yet.
[5847.36 → 5855.96] And then when that didn't happen, that was a big disappointment for me, because 10% performance improvement, IPC, and slightly lower power consumption.
[5857.40 → 5863.58] And you know, one thing, I've actually been wanting to do this for a long time, but I can't figure out a way to make it 100% realistic.
[5864.36 → 5866.50] There's been a lot of tests done on cores for gaming.
[5866.58 → 5867.64] How many cores do you need for gaming?
[5867.82 → 5868.80] Yeah, we've done it.
[5868.80 → 5879.42] Exactly. I want to do a test, though, with 35 tabs open, Windows Media Player running, Skype running, a bunch of other crap running, and a game.
[5880.12 → 5880.82] That's interesting.
[5880.98 → 5883.72] And two monitors, so that I can have all those things actively on the screen.
[5883.72 → 5886.40] So basically, you could just go grab my computer and run on it.
[5886.74 → 5891.74] Seriously, though. No, but like, that's what I mean. I do the same thing. I know tons of my friends do the same thing.
[5892.16 → 5896.84] They go, oh, I only need four cores for gaming, and then they run everything on the planet and play video games at the same time.
[5896.84 → 5903.86] And we tend to run a very clean OS, and for that matter, pretty much everyone does when you're doing gaming benchmarks in order to reduce variables.
[5904.18 → 5912.44] But maybe throwing all the same variables at it would keep the variables reduced while still allowing us to give you guys a better idea of how more cores is really going to affect things.
[5912.44 → 5921.66] I mean, that was how Logan found that the 8350 compared quite favourably to the 3570K at the time was by streaming to Twitch at the same time as benchmarking.
[5921.78 → 5921.88] Yep.
[5922.56 → 5926.00] Also related, this was on Nantes.
[5926.00 → 5933.64] Probably the shortest article ever written by Anand Sh impi, who happens to be my hero. I've got to say that again.
[5934.26 → 5937.52] Between The Verge and Nantes, I would...
[5937.52 → 5938.74] His life is probably complete.
[5938.86 → 5938.96] Yeah.
[5938.96 → 5941.64] If they both disappeared, I don't know if you'd have much to live for.
[5941.78 → 5944.78] It's probably the only tech site that I read daily other than my own.
[5945.24 → 5945.62] Yeah.
[5946.22 → 5946.68] Nantes.
[5946.90 → 5947.08] Yep.
[5947.08 → 5955.18] So anyway, I'll just read the whole article because Asus CEO Jerry Shen just pre-announced the Asus T100.
[5955.62 → 5959.58] A Bay Trail 2-in-1 tablet that's dockable with up to 11 hours of battery life.
[5959.98 → 5961.76] Think Transformer goes Intel.
[5962.06 → 5965.12] I think we just saw the first Bay Trail design win.
[5965.12 → 5977.76] So for those of you who aren't familiar, a design win refers to when a manufacturer takes a reference design or reference platform and actually integrates it into a finished product.
[5978.08 → 5981.36] So NVIDIA has had four iterations of Terra now.
[5981.72 → 5985.64] Only one of which was really, really popular, and that was Terra 2.
[5986.08 → 5989.34] Terra 1 was completely irrelevant.
[5989.78 → 5991.94] Terra 3 didn't see as much adoption.
[5992.08 → 5996.40] However, they did get one major design win, which was obviously the Nexus 7.
[5997.06 → 6000.54] And then Terra 4 so far is just in Shield, but we'll see how it goes from there.
[6000.56 → 6001.46] It's really fast.
[6001.86 → 6003.50] Have I told you how fast Shield is?
[6003.64 → 6006.50] Yeah, but I've also heard rumours of it coming out in other devices and whatnot.
[6006.74 → 6008.80] So anyway, that's a design win.
[6008.80 → 6017.52] So for those who have criticized Intel for not having a mobile strategy and not being aggressive enough, not using their manufacturing expertise to get into this,
[6017.52 → 6025.68] hey, that tide may be turning because on top of that, they have also shown and talked about,
[6025.76 → 6029.58] and I'm trying to find this because we should really have a producer for this show.
[6029.66 → 6034.46] We've had people, we've had people like tell us that.
[6034.46 → 6034.96] Aha!
[6035.22 → 6045.86] They have also shown off the Quark SOC or System on a Chip, which basically is a highly integrated piece of silicon that has basically everything that it needs.
[6046.14 → 6047.86] The Quark family.
[6047.86 → 6051.56] So what's exciting about the Quark family is this.
[6052.12 → 6060.90] Intel, it looks like, is playing catch up in mobile, but is going to just take the lead when it comes to even more mobile than that.
[6060.90 → 6067.64] So Quark is targeted at what's called the Internet of Things, which is the concept that everything is connected.
[6068.26 → 6069.58] These headphones are connected.
[6070.04 → 6072.02] My watch is connected that I don't wear.
[6072.06 → 6072.96] I ordered a Pebble, by the way.
[6072.98 → 6073.76] I don't know if I told you that.
[6074.14 → 6074.78] I'm super stoked.
[6074.78 → 6075.74] I saw your paperweight came in.
[6075.84 → 6076.60] Anyway, sorry.
[6076.96 → 6078.82] No, it's just the case for it.
[6079.18 → 6081.80] They shipped the case first instead of the Pebble paperweight.
[6081.80 → 6092.42] So your phone's connected, your watch is connected, your shoes and your socks are connected, and everything is connected and works together in this amazing, beautiful, harmonious way.
[6092.54 → 6103.26] Your doorknob is fingerprint sensing and only opens for you and tells your wife that you're home so that, you know, she can come and greet you at the door like in the 50s.
[6103.26 → 6123.28] Okay, so that's not progress, but the point is, the Internet of Things, Intel is super serial about the Internet of Things, and they are quoting anywhere from a fifth to one-tenth the size of their existing low-end Atom Silverman CPU cores.
[6123.28 → 6136.84] They're being pretty cagey about a lot of the other details, so they're not saying a lot, but they're saying open architecture, which, to be clear, still means x86, but there will be hooks that, you know, something.
[6137.04 → 6145.20] So we're not talking licensable cores like what ARM's doing, which, I mean, that might be the advantage for ARM.
[6145.60 → 6147.26] Then again, Intel is so powerful.
[6147.58 → 6148.40] Who knows?
[6148.40 → 6158.00] Anyway, open architecture, standard industry software support, so they are saying that it is, they've actually been, they've beat around the bush a little bit here as well.
[6158.24 → 6172.74] So x86 front end, or x86 like, or, so maybe it's not going to be, going to be fully x86 because there's a lot of legacy junk that comes along with x86 that makes those processors not able,
[6172.74 → 6178.54] or at least in the past it wasn't able to happen, that makes it more difficult to scale them down to extremely low-power devices.
[6178.90 → 6183.70] So maybe they're looking at, like, some kind of x86 emulation and something that's simpler.
[6183.80 → 6184.34] Who knows?
[6184.90 → 6187.30] But that's, that's extremely exciting.
[6187.76 → 6188.76] They showed off a bracelet.
[6189.12 → 6189.44] Yeah.
[6189.88 → 6190.82] That was, that was running.
[6190.90 → 6192.36] I was trying to think of what it was.
[6192.58 → 6193.28] I knew they, yeah.
[6193.48 → 6196.58] That's why, that's why I want the details in that.
[6196.58 → 6199.92] See, when he creates the outlines, he doesn't put the same kind of details that I do.
[6200.30 → 6209.40] So sometimes we end up, and we're like, oh, yeah, you know, all that thing that I read, like, an hour ago, but I've been talking for an hour, so I have no idea what it is anymore.
[6209.58 → 6209.78] Yeah.
[6210.02 → 6211.04] I'm, I'm done, man.
[6211.26 → 6211.90] I'm done.
[6213.42 → 6220.18] And then the last thing, the last thing is, aha, Intel demos 14 nanometre Bradwell.
[6220.18 → 6228.58] So in addition to demoing Haswell E, which will be the LGA 2011 platform, they're demoing the upcoming 1150 replacement as well.
[6228.76 → 6232.38] I mean, they just launched both of these, and they're already demoing.
[6232.46 → 6244.48] They're saying, and okay, so for those of you who want to build, like, rocking skookum gaming desktops, guys, be unexcited for the next year and a half or so of Intel releases.
[6244.82 → 6248.86] I'm saying it up front because Bradwell is focused on power consumption.
[6248.86 → 6255.26] Yeah. And like, they even say like, oh, yeah, it's lower power, lower whatever at the same performance level.
[6255.50 → 6255.82] Yes.
[6255.92 → 6261.40] In the thing, it says the same performance level. Like, it's not, don't, don't get too excited as a gamer.
[6261.54 → 6266.62] That's what Intel is targeting. Now, that's not to say that Bradwell won't bring performance improvements.
[6266.80 → 6273.16] In fact, the last few iterations of the TikTok strategy, we've seen that not every die shrink is a pure die shrink.
[6273.68 → 6278.36] Sandy Bridge to Ivy Bridge was just a die shrink, but we got about a 10% IPC improvement.
[6278.36 → 6281.20] Which is about the same as we got from Ivy to Haswell.
[6281.54 → 6289.44] So instead of seeing no improvement and maybe like better overclocking or something and then 20% improvement, we're just seeing 10% improvements at every step.
[6289.60 → 6297.26] So they may still improve performance, but what they're showing is they already have it working at the same performance level with 30% lower power consumption,
[6297.52 → 6300.62] which is, I guess, exciting if you're into power consumption.
[6300.62 → 6307.32] One thing people have to realize about that article at the same time is that it's 30% lower power consumption of the SoC, not 30% lower power consumption of the unit.
[6308.04 → 6309.28] And when it's such a...
[6309.28 → 6312.58] Oh, wait. No, the SoC, we're talking Quark. That was the size reductions of Quark.
[6312.60 → 6312.86] Oh, my bad. My bad. My bad.
[6313.04 → 6313.24] Yeah.
[6313.24 → 6315.04] There were...
[6315.04 → 6315.88] More size reductions.
[6316.72 → 6316.92] Yeah.
[6317.38 → 6323.98] They're showing off a 13.3-inch Haswell Ultrabook that idles at less than 5 watts.
[6323.98 → 6332.42] And of that, only probably 0.5 watts to a watt is going to the CPU core, with 2 to 3 watts to the LCD and the rest to the motherboard and other devices.
[6332.90 → 6338.98] So reducing the CPU power use to 0 watts would actually only cut total power use by another 25% at best.
[6339.60 → 6345.30] These were some of the numbers that Jared Walton from Nantes ran, and that is really crazy.
[6345.30 → 6351.34] Yeah, that's what I'm saying. There's a 30% reduction, but overall, it's more your screen.
[6351.34 → 6356.32] Yeah, it's more going to be screened or... I mean, what else is even left at that point? It's going to be screened.
[6356.50 → 6356.96] It's basically your screen.
[6356.96 → 6361.46] And as we see more efficient screen technologies, we could be looking at that continuing to change.
[6361.54 → 6368.96] That's where it's going to be interesting, is when we get super, super efficient panels, that's where the battery life is going to start chunking down instead of these little individual drops.
[6369.70 → 6373.44] All right. So maybe one or two more topics. I know we do still have a few more.
[6373.84 → 6377.34] Maybe I'll just burn through a couple of them really quick there, and then we'll move into the...
[6378.10 → 6378.30] Sure.
[6378.30 → 6383.76] So, okay, Outlook finally adds IMAP support. Finally. Thank you for that.
[6383.84 → 6390.04] So this was posted on the forum by... Here we go. Let's follow the link. Go, go, go. Ah, there we go.
[6390.18 → 6392.46] Okay. Go away. Go away. Go away, software update.
[6392.96 → 6393.20] Okay.
[6393.20 → 6394.28] Go away. Okay. There we go.
[6394.60 → 6396.76] So this was posted on the forum by Guns Cool.
[6397.02 → 6403.22] So if you're still using Outlook and you haven't been turned off by their lack of IMAP support, then there you go.
[6403.32 → 6404.24] You can be excited about that.
[6404.24 → 6408.36] There are many programs that can't work due to not having IMAP. There are some.
[6408.48 → 6408.68] Yes.
[6408.72 → 6409.70] But there's not that many realistically.
[6409.70 → 6416.16] Joan Rowling to release an extension of the Harry Potter universe.
[6416.16 → 6429.54] So, I mean, whether you see this as a cash grab or whether you see this as just, you know, kind of wanting to go back into it, because it really is an amazing, amazing universe that she created.
[6429.58 → 6432.32] I guess it's not a universe. It's an alternate dimension.
[6433.32 → 6434.68] I don't know. Whatever you want to call it.
[6434.84 → 6435.52] It's awesome.
[6435.52 → 6436.94] I love the Harry Potter books.
[6437.04 → 6440.66] I love, to a far lesser extent, the Harry Potter movies, but I do still love them.
[6441.16 → 6442.14] You can love things differently.
[6442.52 → 6442.54] Yeah.
[6442.62 → 6449.38] So this is a return to that land 70 years prior to the events of the Philosopher's Stone.
[6449.88 → 6456.56] It's actually going to be like a backstory to how one of Harry's textbooks was written and explored some new characters.
[6457.64 → 6457.92] And...
[6457.92 → 6461.10] If they were going to do it some way, I think this was the best way they could do it.
[6461.10 → 6467.62] So it's neither a prequel nor a sequel, but an extension of the Wizarding World, I think, puts it best.
[6467.88 → 6469.08] And it will be a movie.
[6470.06 → 6474.98] So the miniseries begins production in 2014, so they're not wasting any time on this.
[6475.22 → 6477.72] And I know that's not technically computer news, but whatever.
[6477.88 → 6478.80] I care about Harry Potter.
[6478.96 → 6482.18] Therefore, if you're watching my shows, you get to hear about it, too.
[6482.78 → 6483.70] Which is great.
[6484.98 → 6486.62] Star Craft MMO hits Kickstarter.
[6486.82 → 6489.58] This is one of the stupidest Kickstarter's that I've ever seen.
[6489.58 → 6491.36] This was posted on the forum by Cobalt.
[6491.98 → 6494.72] And they're still getting funds via PayPal, even though it's over.
[6494.80 → 6496.18] And they got like $85,000.
[6496.52 → 6503.86] So for one thing, $85,000 of funding to something that was this poorly thought out.
[6504.88 → 6508.72] Like, if you read through this thing, it's just all this, like, theoretic...
[6508.72 → 6509.36] Did you read this?
[6510.38 → 6511.50] I watched the videos.
[6511.86 → 6512.26] Oh, okay.
[6512.34 → 6513.44] I actually didn't watch the videos.
[6513.52 → 6514.12] I just read this.
[6514.36 → 6516.30] It's the stupidest thing I've ever seen.
[6516.30 → 6520.08] Like, it's basically just like, oh, it's going to have this, and it's going to have this, and it's going to have this.
[6520.20 → 6522.74] And you're going to build this for $85,000?
[6523.22 → 6525.52] Do you know how little money $85,000 is?
[6525.62 → 6526.84] It's the back end of Star Craft II.
[6527.08 → 6528.18] Yeah, it doesn't matter.
[6528.40 → 6529.36] They have a lot of it already.
[6529.92 → 6530.68] Even so.
[6531.02 → 6531.76] It's not even...
[6531.76 → 6533.16] It's like, it's not...
[6533.16 → 6533.52] Okay.
[6534.46 → 6543.22] I would bet that for any reasonably well-balanced game, you couldn't perform game testing and balance validation for $85,000.
[6543.22 → 6545.80] I don't care how much of it's done.
[6546.24 → 6547.04] Totally irrelevant.
[6547.14 → 6548.08] There's quite a bit done already.
[6548.10 → 6553.08] $85,000 is not significant in the context of a game developer.
[6553.28 → 6556.06] Considering how long it's been under dev, too, is another big point.
[6556.16 → 6560.68] And considering how long that $85,000 has to keep them going before they all need to give up a hit.
[6560.68 → 6562.04] It's been free dev up until now.
[6562.44 → 6563.44] It's around already.
[6563.80 → 6564.10] Yep.
[6564.28 → 6565.14] It's a thing already.
[6565.50 → 6566.22] But I...
[6567.08 → 6567.34] Yeah.
[6567.58 → 6568.16] You know what?
[6568.34 → 6568.90] Go ahead.
[6569.08 → 6569.80] Back it if you want.
[6569.90 → 6571.26] But I'm not sold.
[6571.26 → 6572.82] And, like, really just...
[6572.82 → 6576.76] The way their Kickstarter campaign is even, like, worded and laid out...
[6576.76 → 6577.58] I didn't read it.
[6577.58 → 6579.64] It's extremely disorganized.
[6579.72 → 6579.96] Is it?
[6580.06 → 6581.72] Like, really disorganized.
[6581.80 → 6583.02] Looks totally half-baked.
[6583.12 → 6584.06] The videos aren't that bad.
[6584.50 → 6584.78] Okay.
[6585.02 → 6585.72] Well, maybe the...
[6585.72 → 6586.62] Well, that's...
[6586.62 → 6589.68] I mean, honestly, great video, and you get Kickstarter funding.
[6589.98 → 6590.18] So...
[6590.18 → 6592.78] Well, like, most people don't read stuff nowadays.
[6593.40 → 6597.46] Look at huge, big reviews that, like, you and I will read.
[6597.74 → 6599.46] They'll have five comments.
[6599.46 → 6599.94] I know.
[6600.04 → 6601.08] It makes me sad, actually.
[6601.94 → 6605.80] With the funny thing about that being that we then make a video about it that people watch,
[6605.94 → 6609.80] which is the service that we provide, where we condense the information we already have
[6609.80 → 6611.74] into digestible video.
[6611.84 → 6611.86] But look at...
[6611.86 → 6612.86] But look at Kickstarter's...
[6612.86 → 6613.16] Which is good.
[6613.92 → 6615.74] Look at the people that are mostly on Kickstarter.
[6615.98 → 6617.36] They're going to want to digest things through video.
[6617.50 → 6617.66] Yep.
[6617.82 → 6619.68] And that's very much the way things are going.
[6619.78 → 6623.30] And, I mean, obviously, it works for us, because we love making videos for you guys.
[6623.70 → 6624.80] I mean, can you believe this is a job?
[6625.20 → 6625.84] Not really.
[6625.84 → 6627.24] Not on Wednesday.
[6627.24 → 6627.78] On Wednesday.
[6627.78 → 6632.62] To be very specific, on Wednesday, no.
[6632.62 → 6638.68] Wednesday, we were, like, on, like, a campsite filming something for A-Data.
[6639.08 → 6640.68] That was pretty fun, actually.
[6641.00 → 6642.48] That was a fun trip.
[6642.58 → 6644.90] I totally think we should do a Linus Media Group camping trip.
[6645.94 → 6646.98] Oh, Easel.
[6646.98 → 6651.74] He was, like, within, like, a couple of minutes of being there, he's like,
[6651.86 → 6653.04] Ah, I got a bug bite!
[6653.30 → 6653.70] ETH!
[6653.96 → 6654.28] ETH!
[6654.28 → 6655.36] And you guys can tweet him.
[6655.40 → 6658.68] You can tell him I said that, because I said it to his face, so it was already done.
[6658.76 → 6659.44] Well, that's what happened.
[6660.16 → 6661.20] Yeah, that's exactly what happened.
[6661.26 → 6662.78] He said that, and then I said that to his face.
[6663.48 → 6664.72] Instagram's getting ads!
[6664.96 → 6668.70] The article is on Huffington Post that we are linking to here.
[6668.88 → 6672.76] My favourite part about this is they just added support for 15-second-long videos.
[6673.92 → 6674.32] Yes.
[6674.98 → 6675.42] Advertisements.
[6675.42 → 6675.82] Advertisements.
[6676.62 → 6677.06] Yes!
[6677.32 → 6679.88] It's like, oh, I wonder why you pushed to add that.
[6680.22 → 6684.34] It's not really very clear how the ads are going to be implemented yet.
[6684.78 → 6689.98] What is clear is that their user base tends to be a little bit, I don't know, what's the right word?
[6690.08 → 6690.48] Hipster?
[6690.84 → 6695.64] Yes, but at the same time, they had that huge thing back in, what, I think, December?
[6696.16 → 6698.84] And the last year, I think, where they changed their terms of service.
[6699.04 → 6700.48] And everyone's like, we're going to leave!
[6700.48 → 6704.86] No one will stay on Instagram because they can use our photos for commercial purposes!
[6704.86 → 6708.32] Well, as of February, I believe it's gained by 50%.
[6708.32 → 6709.82] Yeah, 50% more users.
[6709.82 → 6710.32] That's huge!
[6710.32 → 6712.08] I'm on Instagram now.
[6712.08 → 6721.24] Speaking of Instagram, one of the few benefits I think my iPhone 4 will be getting from iOS 7 is the new square photo taking mode.
[6721.24 → 6728.52] It's like, it's built in now so that you don't have to use the I mean, you look at how deeply Apple's in bed with Twitter, and I guess it makes sense.
[6728.78 → 6737.28] Like, if people really wanted that Instagram look, they could use Apple's own filters, they could use the square mode, and then they could tweet it, I guess, is the idea to make Instagram irrelevant.
[6737.42 → 6738.58] But anyway, I like Instagram.
[6739.26 → 6740.18] I actually like it.
[6740.42 → 6741.04] It's kind of fun.
[6741.10 → 6741.80] You play around with the filters.
[6741.86 → 6743.22] I thought it was the stupidest thing in the world.
[6743.22 → 6746.24] You've heard me rant about Instagram before, but I kind of changed my mind.
[6746.42 → 6747.18] He loves his filters.
[6747.18 → 6751.56] So that's one of the few benefits I'm going to get out of iOS 7 when I upgrade.
[6753.40 → 6756.22] You're going to turn into a hashtagging, filter-using...
[6756.96 → 6761.24] I'm already a hashtagging, filter-using social media junkie.
[6762.02 → 6763.10] It's my job!
[6763.18 → 6764.86] I remember before you got Twitter.
[6765.68 → 6766.88] You do remember that!
[6767.40 → 6768.98] We made fun of all the people.
[6768.98 → 6773.66] Anyway, it's not really clear how the ads are going to be implemented, but I would be quite surprised.
[6774.14 → 6778.90] I mean, you look at how aggressively Facebook has added ads, and you know what?
[6778.98 → 6783.80] Yeah, Facebook isn't as hip or chic as it was at one point, but it's not like the users are off it.
[6784.44 → 6787.88] I still use Facebook to communicate with people that refuse to get off Facebook.
[6788.04 → 6791.46] One thing I was wondering about is, is there ad block for your entire phone?
[6791.64 → 6793.16] Like, is there ad block that spills into...
[6793.16 → 6793.80] I don't use ad blocks.
[6793.80 → 6802.02] I think there are apps you can install if you're rooted that will basically just block all the ad servers.
[6802.80 → 6807.34] And so it'll even do things like pull advertising out of trial apps and stuff like that.
[6807.62 → 6811.42] Yeah, I was playing around with it a little bit when I rooted my wife's phone.
[6812.10 → 6815.82] Speaking of my wife, who would like to see her as a guest on the WAN show?
[6816.80 → 6819.10] I don't think she would want to be on it.
[6819.14 → 6820.34] I asked her about it.
[6820.34 → 6822.90] She was kind of like, no, I don't think anyone would want to have me as a guest.
[6822.90 → 6823.42] Oh.
[6823.76 → 6825.56] And I was like, oh, well, I don't know.
[6825.62 → 6826.48] There's only one way to find out.
[6826.48 → 6828.56] I think you'll probably get overwhelming support for that.
[6828.82 → 6829.64] I think so too.
[6829.74 → 6836.92] I think, I mean, she might give too much sort of insight into me.
[6837.92 → 6840.62] Well, I think that's pretty much it for our news this week.
[6840.68 → 6843.80] Why don't you go ahead and hit us with This Week in Forums?
[6843.98 → 6847.42] So we've got This Week in Forums, which, where is it?
[6847.42 → 6852.78] One thing I wanted to send out, which I will tweet right now, if I can get Twitter open quickly enough.
[6852.90 → 6857.16] But there are the unofficial Linus Tech Tips gaming servers.
[6857.42 → 6860.02] We have a lot of unofficial Linus Tech Tips stuff.
[6860.12 → 6860.38] We do?
[6860.58 → 6861.98] Which is actually really cool.
[6862.06 → 6862.72] Actually, I knew that.
[6863.00 → 6867.50] And the main reason why I wanted to talk about this is because of what he just said.
[6867.68 → 6868.46] The do thing.
[6868.46 → 6869.48] But who knows?
[6869.48 → 6876.74] Who, like, a lot of people don't know about this because the PC gaming forum is kind of tucked in at the bottom and doesn't get quite as much traffic as a lot of other forums.
[6877.20 → 6879.96] A lot to do with where its position is on the forum physically.
[6879.96 → 6884.30] So I wanted to tweet this out because we have servers.
[6884.48 → 6885.32] Like, not us.
[6885.44 → 6892.38] But members of the community have made servers so that people in the community can go play with each other, which is super cool.
[6892.78 → 6897.88] They're not managed by any moderators from Linus Tech Tips or anything, but they're unofficial Linus Tech Tips servers.
[6898.36 → 6899.38] And they're actually pretty cool.
[6899.48 → 6901.64] So check out that thread, which I just linked out.
[6901.64 → 6905.84] So other than that, our folding teams and brink teams are doing great.
[6906.12 → 6909.98] We got a bunch more traffic last week from the callout I did there.
[6910.06 → 6912.78] So if you're interested in folding or brink, hit up on the forums.
[6912.92 → 6915.26] Ask Whaler what the heck is going on with folding and ask Liquids what the heck is going on with folding.
[6915.26 → 6917.08] Can we refer to it as folding and blinking?
[6917.68 → 6918.14] And blinking.
[6918.36 → 6920.42] And ask Liquids what the heck is going on with blinking.
[6922.68 → 6925.06] Now we can jump into Build Logs if you can download this.
[6925.32 → 6925.96] Yeah, yeah.
[6926.00 → 6926.72] I'm downloading it.
[6926.72 → 6928.38] I had forgotten that Office is still...
[6928.38 → 6928.80] You know what?
[6928.80 → 6936.68] That really sort of reminds me of the conversation we had with Marcus Brownlee earlier on is,
[6937.38 → 6941.56] can Apple with work take over Microsoft space?
[6941.94 → 6943.68] Can Google with Drive take it over?
[6944.14 → 6947.98] I've been using this laptop for weeks now, and Office has been broken since day one.
[6948.60 → 6950.50] And I haven't gotten around to fix it.
[6950.50 → 6952.62] I didn't notice until WAN show.
[6952.92 → 6957.68] And then in between WAN shows, I didn't even try to launch it again and feel a need to...
[6957.68 → 6958.74] Yep, that's very true.
[6958.80 → 6959.50] Crazy.
[6960.58 → 6962.26] Corporate security is a big thing too, though.
[6962.98 → 6963.94] Okay, fair enough.
[6964.54 → 6965.36] All right, there we go.
[6966.10 → 6967.54] Slideshow from...
[6967.54 → 6969.98] So we're starting with Thor Desk Mod by DSX.
[6971.24 → 6972.62] Very original name.
[6973.34 → 6975.06] Which is pretty beast.
[6975.18 → 6978.62] One thing that I would have maybe liked to see, and a test that I actually want to do, though,
[6978.66 → 6982.62] suggested by a forum member, does I want to test PCIe extensions.
[6983.12 → 6983.42] Oh, okay.
[6983.78 → 6986.00] And I would have liked to see one on here.
[6986.36 → 6986.50] Right.
[6986.60 → 6986.88] Because...
[6986.88 → 6988.40] Throw the graphics card here, perhaps?
[6988.50 → 6989.56] Or just somewhere else?
[6989.56 → 6989.74] Yeah.
[6989.74 → 6991.68] And he has two of them, so it would be slightly more difficult.
[6992.02 → 6992.78] But if...
[6992.78 → 6993.10] Slightly?
[6993.10 → 6993.22] Totally.
[6993.22 → 6995.48] Because he'd have to, like, put the SLI...
[6995.48 → 6996.52] He could build a bracket.
[6996.78 → 6997.26] I guess so.
[6997.32 → 6997.48] Okay.
[6998.06 → 6999.86] But it's a little bit tall.
[7000.00 → 7001.86] Once you see a video from the side...
[7001.86 → 7003.12] Picture from the side, sorry.
[7004.12 → 7005.24] There's more of a side one.
[7005.24 → 7007.40] There's more of a side one, but don't click yet.
[7007.44 → 7009.18] I just wanted to do some shots of the inside.
[7009.30 → 7010.46] He's got beautiful sleeving.
[7010.62 → 7011.60] Beautiful multicoloured sleeving.
[7011.60 → 7012.00] That's cool.
[7012.10 → 7012.86] I like that.
[7013.14 → 7014.92] Individual loops, which is great.
[7014.94 → 7015.12] Yep.
[7015.18 → 7018.90] So there, you can see two different colours is achieved best by having two separate water
[7018.90 → 7019.44] cooling loops.
[7019.64 → 7019.86] Yep.
[7020.94 → 7022.90] It looks fantastic.
[7023.30 → 7025.86] Now, if we go one more, that's what I'm talking about.
[7025.88 → 7026.90] It's quite thick.
[7027.36 → 7027.64] Oh, I see.
[7027.64 → 7031.98] And when you're looking at desks, personally, desks are usually pretty thin because of how your
[7031.98 → 7035.54] arm position is and where your legs are in proportion to where your arms are.
[7035.64 → 7038.02] So there's actually quite a big differential there.
[7038.16 → 7043.10] So your arms would be kind of up, which you might not mind, but personally, I would.
[7043.16 → 7047.32] So if I was personally building that computer, I would have tried to get an extension in there
[7047.32 → 7048.08] and make it more flat.
[7048.18 → 7049.28] Looks fantastic, though.
[7049.32 → 7050.32] It looks great.
[7050.46 → 7052.74] And I really like how he actually made the desk himself.
[7052.74 → 7055.06] So Barium Len by Exon.
[7056.00 → 7057.74] So it's not...
[7057.74 → 7060.88] He doesn't have a ton of very good photos of it completed yet.
[7060.88 → 7065.00] So he was at a LAN, and this is where his completed photo is from.
[7065.22 → 7066.14] He's coming back.
[7066.40 → 7068.90] So check out his thread because he will be updating it.
[7069.38 → 7073.46] But I really wanted to show this off because he got this case, and then he did a bunch of
[7073.46 → 7074.18] custom things to it.
[7074.20 → 7078.88] And one of my favourite ones is this is the motherboard tray that he put LEDs on so it
[7078.88 → 7080.00] will glow from behind.
[7080.00 → 7080.58] You know what?
[7080.68 → 7084.84] A-Bit did that with their original Fatality board back for LGA 775.
[7085.44 → 7086.84] And I thought it looked great.
[7087.00 → 7087.40] It does.
[7087.40 → 7090.94] I wish more manufacturers had done it, but this is a great way to add it DIY.
[7090.94 → 7092.02] I really wanted to show that off.
[7092.12 → 7095.60] But make sure you check out Exon's thread because he will be updating.
[7095.70 → 7098.64] That's why there's only two pictures from him is because there's a lot of in-progress
[7098.64 → 7100.80] shots that don't necessarily look like the final thing.
[7101.06 → 7104.30] And then there are a couple shots of, like, the chick with the computer, but it's not
[7104.30 → 7105.38] very zoomed in on the computer.
[7105.54 → 7109.52] So wait until he updates with more actual finished ones that are focusing on the
[7109.52 → 7110.62] computer and not the girl.
[7110.62 → 7115.08] And, yeah, I was going to say a big problem is that the Twitch chat's going crazy over
[7115.08 → 7117.82] not the computer, but the girl standing next to it.
[7117.98 → 7121.08] So, yeah, there you go.
[7121.38 → 7123.84] Well, there might be more pictures of the girl, so check out his thread anyway.
[7124.22 → 7124.88] All right, guys.
[7124.98 → 7127.94] So if you want to check out Build Logs of the Week, check out the Build Logs section of
[7127.94 → 7128.30] the forum.
[7128.42 → 7129.48] They're going to be pinned at the top.
[7129.54 → 7133.38] If you want to check out all the topics we discussed this week, as well as the links
[7133.38 → 7137.42] to where you can find them in the Linus News and Ramblings section of the forum, I'm
[7137.42 → 7139.64] going to get that posted up as soon as I get a chance here.
[7140.02 → 7143.78] And, as always, you can watch the archive of the WAN show on YouTube if you missed anything
[7143.78 → 7147.64] or if you just want to watch the whole thing again because it's that riveting.
[7148.60 → 7150.40] Which, I mean, that's great.
[7150.94 → 7153.98] Thank you very much for watching, and we'll see you guys again.
[7154.52 → 7155.94] I won't be here next week.
[7156.26 → 7156.58] Yeah.
[7156.80 → 7157.18] Actually.
[7157.36 → 7158.38] Ooh, big bomb.
[7159.00 → 7159.64] That'll be interesting.
[7159.64 → 7160.64] Drop into bomb.
[7160.90 → 7164.90] So anyone who tunes out while I'm doing the outro will just totally miss that.
[7165.16 → 7165.58] Have no idea.
[7165.62 → 7166.46] They'll have no idea.
[7166.46 → 7168.06] And then next week, I'll be gone.
[7168.18 → 7170.22] I should try and find someone that looks like you.
[7170.66 → 7171.82] Or just like a dummy.
[7172.94 → 7173.80] Not that a dummy.
[7174.04 → 7175.02] Not that I look like a dummy.
[7175.28 → 7176.12] A cardboard cutout?
[7176.20 → 7176.86] Her, her, her.
[7176.94 → 7177.20] Pun.
[7177.54 → 7177.84] Pun.
[7178.20 → 7178.52] Pun.
[7178.82 → 7179.00] Ah.
[7181.00 → 7183.22] We didn't have any EA news this week.
[7184.08 → 7184.84] That's a good thing.
[7185.10 → 7185.44] Yeah.
[7185.78 → 7186.14] Usually.
[7186.46 → 7186.78] Usually.
[7187.06 → 7187.28] Yeah.
[7187.64 → 7188.30] Sometimes it's good.
[7188.56 → 7188.92] Oh, yeah.
[7188.96 → 7189.94] There's a new Humble Bundle.
[7190.06 → 7191.08] We didn't even talk about that.
[7191.10 → 7192.80] The Humble Bundle's epic, too.
[7193.06 → 7194.84] Oh, I can't believe I didn't put this in the doc.
[7194.84 → 7195.40] I know.
[7195.60 → 7196.48] What's wrong with you?
[7196.52 → 7197.56] You even told me about it.
[7197.66 → 7198.22] Yeah, I know.
[7198.96 → 7199.92] Oh, man.
[7200.46 → 7202.60] Yeah, I guess it's more important that you get it going.
[7202.88 → 7203.56] So get that up.
[7203.68 → 7204.40] Way to go.
[7204.76 → 7206.18] This thing's sweet.
[7206.18 → 7208.32] And they haven't even announced the extra games.
[7208.54 → 7212.66] Every single time, it became kind of a thing, because every single time they'd add, like,
[7212.88 → 7214.20] usually two games.
[7214.46 → 7216.70] So now they finally have more games coming soon.
[7217.08 → 7219.52] Because, like, before it was like, yeah, okay, there are more games coming.
[7219.62 → 7224.76] Trine 2, Mark of the Ninja, Eats Munchies Beta, Brutal Legend, Faster Than Light, and
[7224.76 → 7225.64] Fez.
[7225.78 → 7227.40] For paying more than $4.60.
[7227.78 → 7228.42] Huge names.
[7228.58 → 7229.86] Fez, huge name.
[7229.96 → 7231.50] FTL, huge name.
[7231.62 → 7234.40] Like, it's not, like, random things you haven't heard of.
[7234.48 → 7238.98] Fez, FTL, Mark of the Ninja, Trine, all of those are huge titles.
[7239.56 → 7242.04] Brutal Legend got some mixed reviews, but is a big game.
[7242.28 → 7242.96] And then there's a beta.
[7242.96 → 7244.98] Yeah, Yankee didn't like it, which is basically all I need to know.
[7245.98 → 7246.84] Mind you, he doesn't like anything.
[7246.84 → 7248.66] I was just going to say, Yankee doesn't like anything.
[7249.48 → 7250.28] Whatever, man.
[7251.06 → 7254.28] If Valve would release Half-Life 2, Episode 3, I'm sure he would like it.
[7255.90 → 7256.22] Ooh.
[7256.82 → 7258.28] That would be a fascinating review.
[7258.42 → 7258.62] Yeah.
[7258.78 → 7260.58] Because he'd probably just rag on how long it took to come out.
[7260.62 → 7260.88] Yeah.
[7261.40 → 7262.22] Like, the whole time.
[7262.34 → 7263.12] Which means it's a good game.
[7263.12 → 7264.56] But then at the end it would be like, but it's great.
[7264.72 → 7264.92] Yeah.
[7264.98 → 7265.48] Yeah, anyway.
[7266.16 → 7267.58] So, yeah, Humble Indie Bundle.
[7267.64 → 7269.12] I forget, what else was I going to say?
[7270.50 → 7273.00] No, there was going to be, there was, like, another thing I was going to say before I left.
[7273.06 → 7274.52] Oh, yeah, thanks again to our sponsors.
[7274.86 → 7276.98] Squarespace and Hotspot Shield, you guys are great.
[7277.04 → 7278.12] You make The WAN Show possible.
[7278.12 → 7283.28] As much as, like, you know, doing this for, out of the goodness of our heart, is something
[7283.28 → 7284.34] that we did for months.
[7284.54 → 7286.06] And we would happily keep doing.
[7286.16 → 7287.30] Having sponsors on the show.
[7287.58 → 7291.30] And for those of you who put up with us having sponsor breaks, thank you so much.
[7291.30 → 7294.60] Because it makes it sustainable for us to do this.
[7294.80 → 7294.82] Yeah.
[7294.82 → 7296.34] And we really like it.
[7296.38 → 7297.26] And we hope you like it, too.
[7297.34 → 7298.08] And good night, everyone.
[7298.28 → 7298.80] Good night, guys.
[7299.14 → 7299.68] Thanks for watching.
[7299.68 → 7299.74] Bye.
