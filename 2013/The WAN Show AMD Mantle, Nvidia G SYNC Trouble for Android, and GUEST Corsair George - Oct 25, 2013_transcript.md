[0.00 --> 10.62]  Hello and welcome to the WAN Show guys, the weekly show that tells you everything you need to know about technology in three hours or more or less.
[11.36 --> 12.12]  Three hours?
[12.36 --> 13.08]  We've done that.
[13.22 --> 13.46]  We have.
[13.46 --> 17.10]  Almost. We've done like two and a half, so I couldn't even say two hours or less.
[17.38 --> 18.78]  It's usually two hours or less.
[18.80 --> 26.70]  It's usually two hours or less, but today's show I think is going to be a little bit on the shorter side, but we've still got a lot of information to pack in there for you.
[26.70 --> 35.62]  So number one is our special guest, the one, the only, I was making points, but there aren't two of them.
[36.36 --> 39.12]  George Macris from Corsair will be joining us.
[39.18 --> 49.06]  So for those of you who don't know who Corsair George is, number one, shame on you because true PC enthusiasts who appreciate the work that he's done over the years should know who he is.
[49.10 --> 53.00]  He's the guy, the guy behind the Corsair 800D.
[53.00 --> 62.58]  So that was Corsair's first enthusiast class computer gaming case, and he's actually been the mastermind behind a lot of the other innovations that they've brought to the case market since then.
[62.66 --> 64.78]  So we're really excited to talk to him.
[64.86 --> 66.44]  And then what else we got for the show today?
[66.68 --> 70.86]  Quantum Minecraft from Google, which is just awesome and ridiculous.
[71.24 --> 71.44]  Yes.
[71.90 --> 73.58]  It's not a quantum pickaxe, though.
[73.60 --> 74.54]  It could be a quantum pickaxe.
[74.54 --> 76.92]  Unless I like look away and look back and then it's like a sword.
[77.04 --> 77.74]  Yes. See?
[78.58 --> 79.20]  How do you know that?
[79.46 --> 80.08]  Try it.
[80.08 --> 84.16]  That was not planned.
[84.48 --> 85.42]  That was awesome.
[86.38 --> 86.70]  Okay.
[87.14 --> 88.04]  290X performance.
[88.22 --> 88.94]  We're going to talk about that.
[89.00 --> 91.30]  I think we're probably going to have a Twitter blitz based around that, too.
[91.32 --> 92.62]  Yeah, we've got to talk 290X.
[92.88 --> 93.16]  Yep.
[93.36 --> 99.24]  And then Infinity Ward saying that COD players are not hardcore gamers and maybe not even gamers at all.
[99.80 --> 100.08]  That...
[100.82 --> 101.08]  Okay.
[101.08 --> 105.80]  See, every time you say this, I'm going to have to start talking about it because that...
[105.80 --> 106.88]  It's amazing.
[106.88 --> 112.76]  Um, also, Apple patent, uh, Apple's patent for capacitive touchscreens might actually go through.
[113.48 --> 115.50]  Well, it's been upheld for now.
[115.60 --> 115.82]  Yeah.
[115.96 --> 119.16]  Which might be a big, big problem.
[119.44 --> 123.28]  If your name isn't Nokia, Microsoft, or HTC.
[123.40 --> 124.92]  So more on that in a moment.
[124.92 --> 131.20]  Like, we could be looking at basically any device that is a Galaxy S4 or similar.
[132.06 --> 133.64]  Could be just not for sale.
[133.92 --> 134.54]  At least not in the...
[134.54 --> 135.64]  Which is U.S.
[135.76 --> 136.02]  Yeah.
[136.34 --> 137.44]  Could be a big problem.
[137.76 --> 139.30]  So, without further ado, guys.
[139.44 --> 140.30]  Intro time!
[140.30 --> 140.88]  Intro time!
[140.88 --> 142.30]  Intro time!
[142.30 --> 145.26]  Intro time!
[145.26 --> 162.96]  Alright guys.
[163.08 --> 165.96]  So we've got a couple sponsors for the show this week.
[166.04 --> 167.10]  Number one is Squarespace.
[167.10 --> 171.84]  Squarespace is the easy way to create a professional looking website for yourself, your business,
[171.84 --> 174.44]  or whatever else you might want to create a website for.
[174.44 --> 175.56]  And Hotspot Shield.
[175.56 --> 176.66]  You can get...
[176.66 --> 176.96]  Oh yeah.
[177.06 --> 177.20]  Sorry.
[177.32 --> 181.66]  For Squarespace, you can get 10% off on new accounts through the month of October.
[181.84 --> 185.14]  You're going to squarespace.com slash Linus and using the code Linus10.
[185.46 --> 186.72]  And then Hotspot Shield.
[186.82 --> 187.78]  Powered by Anchor Free.
[188.02 --> 191.06]  You can get 20% off elite prices with offer code Linus.
[191.14 --> 193.56]  You can sign up at bit.ly slash hsshare.
[193.56 --> 197.10]  And Hotspot Shield is an easy to use VPN solution.
[197.24 --> 202.88]  So that allows you to get around regional restrictions on services like Netflix, or get around things
[202.88 --> 206.92]  like blanket censorship in countries where that kind of thing is a problem.
[207.02 --> 212.22]  You want to access YouTube, you're in China, Hotspot Shield could be the right solution for you.
[212.40 --> 213.54]  If you can get Hotspot Shield.
[213.64 --> 215.30]  If you can get Hotspot Shield in China.
[215.38 --> 216.12]  So it's an example.
[216.34 --> 220.46]  I actually don't know if specifically Hotspot Shield works in China because there's all kinds
[220.46 --> 221.80]  of crazy voodoo magic that goes on with the internet over there.
[221.80 --> 222.64]  Well, it probably works.
[222.64 --> 224.72]  You probably just have to try and get it, which I think would be helpful.
[224.72 --> 225.36]  You'd have to figure it out.
[225.42 --> 228.46]  We get some viewership out of China somehow.
[228.90 --> 230.88]  It's usually like single digit views.
[230.98 --> 232.90]  So I have no idea how exactly it happens.
[233.24 --> 235.72]  But it's kind of funny to me.
[236.40 --> 236.84]  All right.
[236.92 --> 238.38]  So kicking things off.
[238.44 --> 239.48]  Welcome to the show.
[239.92 --> 240.28]  Google.
[241.38 --> 241.78]  Okay.
[241.92 --> 242.36]  You know what?
[242.36 --> 243.96]  I'm going to let you field this one.
[244.04 --> 245.78]  Quantum computing comes to Minecraft.
[246.40 --> 247.36]  So there's a quote.
[247.44 --> 248.78]  I'm actually going to read this directly.
[248.86 --> 249.56]  I'm just going to help.
[249.56 --> 255.12]  Google's quantum AI team quoted saying, where will the future of quantum computer scientists
[255.12 --> 255.74]  come from?
[255.94 --> 257.52]  Our best guess, Minecraft.
[257.88 --> 264.62]  So in response to this, they have released a quantum module for Minecraft.
[264.72 --> 269.98]  It's not really actually quantum, but it's representing different parts of quantum ideas.
[269.98 --> 274.28]  So quantum entanglement, quantum superposition, and observer dependency.
[275.20 --> 278.24]  There's a video that we can watch, which I think we really should watch, that shows
[278.24 --> 281.04]  them showing off QCraft, which is their little module for it.
[281.40 --> 282.98]  So if we jump into...
[284.18 --> 285.96]  I don't think that's the right one.
[286.08 --> 286.64]  Way to go.
[286.82 --> 287.48]  Give me a second.
[287.78 --> 288.12]  All right.
[288.18 --> 289.20]  So you're going to go ahead and do that.
[289.36 --> 290.12]  I'm going to go find it.
[290.12 --> 295.52]  So basically what that means is Minecraft is already basically like a particle simulator,
[295.68 --> 296.24]  so to speak.
[296.34 --> 300.62]  So it's got its own physical rules for the way that things behave within the game.
[300.70 --> 307.80]  So what this will do is it'll allow you to apply quantum rules to the objects that already
[307.80 --> 310.54]  exist within Minecraft using this module.
[310.54 --> 315.56]  So once you fire up the link, we will be able to actually show something.
[316.88 --> 320.60]  I've got stuff, but it's not the video that I actually wanted.
[320.66 --> 320.88]  Okay.
[320.94 --> 325.04]  Well, at any rate, guys, what we're going to do is we are going to link the video in the
[325.04 --> 325.72]  WAN Show doc.
[325.80 --> 328.68]  That'll be up on the Linus Tech Tips forum after the show.
[329.08 --> 331.00]  So guys, do definitely check it out.
[331.10 --> 336.10]  But basically what it's designed to do is let players experiment with quantum behaviors
[336.10 --> 343.28]  inside Minecraft's world with new blocks that exhibit these quantum properties that you
[343.28 --> 348.78]  wouldn't normally observe with something like a pickaxe or a piece of stone or a piece
[348.78 --> 352.44]  of the kinds of objects that we can already find within the Minecraft world.
[353.10 --> 355.54]  So it's...
[355.54 --> 358.30]  Is Minecraft an educational tool now?
[358.72 --> 359.94]  It kind of...
[359.94 --> 364.04]  It's funny because I think it was only two weeks ago that Minecraft was causing violence.
[364.04 --> 365.66]  People to start killing people and stuff.
[366.10 --> 369.98]  I can't find the video, but essentially the kind of stuff that happens is like, say he
[369.98 --> 373.84]  walks up to this stone wall and he's like, okay, well, how the heck do I get through this?
[373.86 --> 374.70]  He looks in a box.
[374.84 --> 377.32]  There's something you can light wood on fire with.
[377.48 --> 380.06]  And he looks at the wall and he looks away and looks around for a little bit and looks
[380.06 --> 380.46]  back.
[380.62 --> 381.68]  And now they're wooden blocks.
[381.82 --> 384.74]  And he's like, oh, light them on fire.
[384.92 --> 385.80]  Because they changed.
[385.90 --> 387.86]  Because he looked away and then looked back.
[387.90 --> 389.54]  And there's a lot of this weird dependency stuff.
[389.92 --> 393.70]  And one thing to be able to actually get through the puzzle, he just kind of spun in circles.
[393.70 --> 397.26]  Because the whole room was just morphing around him as he spun in circles.
[397.66 --> 399.80]  And then it created a hole and then he jumped down the hole.
[399.94 --> 402.88]  And then when he jumped down the hole and looked up, the roof was completely different
[402.88 --> 403.76]  than what he came through.
[403.88 --> 407.42]  And everything's just changing as you go through the level without you actually interacting
[407.42 --> 408.00]  with it at all.
[408.40 --> 409.44]  And that's a huge part about it.
[409.48 --> 413.32]  And then there's going to be the blocks in the game so that you can create these things.
[413.68 --> 416.00]  So it's not just Google making these courses for people.
[416.10 --> 416.70]  You can create your own.
[416.70 --> 418.70]  And that's the perfect community to give it to.
[419.30 --> 419.62]  Absolutely.
[419.90 --> 424.56]  I mean, I think that there's enough guys there that are going to go hardcore geeking
[424.56 --> 429.58]  out over something like this and build what are going to be effectively educational
[429.58 --> 433.86]  tools about a concept that most people have very little grasp on whatsoever.
[434.14 --> 439.10]  And now we could be looking at 11-year-olds, 12-year-olds picking up Minecraft and getting
[439.10 --> 442.94]  a better understanding of quantum mechanics than their parents have.
[443.14 --> 443.92]  Just ridiculous.
[443.92 --> 444.92]  So...
[444.92 --> 446.62]  It's pretty awesome.
[446.98 --> 447.92]  And like...
[447.92 --> 449.12]  Let's say quantum mechanics.
[449.28 --> 449.34]  Sorry.
[449.40 --> 449.96]  Quantum physics.
[450.22 --> 450.40]  Yeah.
[451.02 --> 451.42]  It's okay.
[452.28 --> 456.10]  The different things that I'm really excited for is the people messing with it like we
[456.10 --> 456.66]  just talked about.
[456.72 --> 459.66]  Because we've seen people in Minecraft make computers.
[460.48 --> 464.56]  And like make calculators using blocks, which is insane.
[464.88 --> 470.18]  So if you take those same people and give them blocks with quantum properties, I'm actually
[470.18 --> 471.16]  pretty stoked to see what's...
[471.16 --> 473.12]  I might have to launch up Minecraft again.
[473.12 --> 473.84]  Yeah.
[474.00 --> 475.20]  No, this is really cool.
[475.20 --> 475.38]  I haven't done it in a while.
[476.18 --> 477.58]  So topic number two.
[477.68 --> 480.06]  This is an article from IGN.
[480.14 --> 480.54]  This is...
[480.54 --> 481.12]  This is...
[481.12 --> 483.12]  I don't know if this is hilarious or pathetic.
[483.58 --> 488.30]  But in Brazil, the PlayStation 4 will cost over $1,800.
[488.30 --> 496.82]  So to be clear, we're not talking like Brazilian, you know, rupees or whatever they use there.
[496.82 --> 497.40]  It's not rupees.
[497.40 --> 498.34]  I know it isn't rupees.
[498.34 --> 503.64]  But the point is that we're talking over $1,800 equivalent US dollars.
[503.64 --> 508.38]  So never even mind the difference in earning potential there.
[508.48 --> 510.32]  Never even mind all those other factors.
[510.90 --> 516.94]  You as an American going down there with US dollars and walking into a store to buy a PlayStation 4,
[516.94 --> 519.54]  you would be expected to fork over $1,800.
[520.54 --> 523.70]  In comparison, the...
[523.70 --> 528.16]  So that translated to the actual local currency is about $3,999.
[528.94 --> 534.88]  The Xbox One is going to come in at $2,199, which is a difference of $1,800.
[535.66 --> 538.14]  This isn't American dollars right now that we're dealing with.
[538.20 --> 538.82]  But if you think...
[538.82 --> 541.36]  If you look at that scale, the one costs $4,000.
[541.52 --> 543.00]  The other one costs $2,199.
[543.08 --> 546.56]  That's a difference of almost the cost of the Xbox.
[547.70 --> 548.16]  Which is insane.
[548.16 --> 548.90]  So you could buy...
[548.90 --> 550.18]  You could literally buy two.
[550.20 --> 551.20]  You could almost buy two Xboxes.
[551.64 --> 552.04]  Almost.
[552.24 --> 552.48]  Almost.
[552.48 --> 552.70]  Pretty close.
[553.16 --> 554.62]  Like, that's insane.
[554.62 --> 561.94]  So it's being blamed on import tariffs and duties and taxes and all those kinds of fees that are normally...
[561.94 --> 564.42]  Actually, I mean, Brazil is pretty brutal for this.
[564.42 --> 570.74]  They do have very, very, like, massive duties on anything that's being imported.
[571.08 --> 572.36]  And it's being blamed on that.
[572.46 --> 576.10]  But, I mean, you look at what the launch price was for PS3.
[577.28 --> 580.36]  And I don't think that their tax laws have changed that dramatically.
[580.44 --> 581.46]  What was the PS3 launch price?
[581.48 --> 582.68]  PS3 launch price...
[582.68 --> 583.98]  PS3 was launched there late.
[583.98 --> 585.90]  It was launched in 2010, I believe.
[586.22 --> 589.14]  And I think the actual North American launch was 2006.
[589.52 --> 589.62]  Okay.
[589.76 --> 590.68]  So you have to factor in...
[590.68 --> 592.74]  Like, I know the North American launch was really expensive, too.
[592.86 --> 593.60]  But, yeah.
[593.60 --> 602.50]  So the PS3 launch in 2010 was $1,999 local dollars or $924.69 American.
[602.76 --> 603.08]  Okay.
[603.20 --> 604.56]  So now we're looking at...
[604.56 --> 605.24]  Well, okay.
[605.38 --> 608.36]  It's, you know, twice as fast, therefore twice as...
[608.36 --> 609.64]  I don't know what the logic here is.
[609.64 --> 611.14]  So you look at that.
[611.14 --> 615.38]  And then you also look at what Microsoft is launching the Xbox One at.
[615.72 --> 617.88]  So just over $1,000 US dollars.
[617.88 --> 626.54]  And you've got to wonder, given that Xbox One comes with a Kinect and Sony has spent a fair bit of time poking at them about how they're more expensive.
[626.74 --> 629.26]  What was the justification for this being so expensive in Brazil?
[629.26 --> 631.48]  It's kind of obscene.
[631.48 --> 633.92]  And I'm sure if I lived in Brazil, I'd be kind of pissed.
[634.34 --> 635.60]  Because that's just ridiculous.
[635.76 --> 636.86]  Like, there's no way I could afford that.
[637.00 --> 637.64]  That's insane.
[637.78 --> 641.10]  It's one of those things where I really feel like Brazil does this to themselves in a big way.
[641.16 --> 641.74]  Like, I mean...
[641.74 --> 642.10]  Okay.
[642.10 --> 646.24]  So back to my whole working at a computer retailer.
[646.86 --> 647.28]  Okay.
[647.36 --> 648.38]  This is a thing.
[648.82 --> 652.44]  North American retailers, and I'm not going to name any names, but I know who does it.
[652.74 --> 658.32]  North American retailers buying, literally, like shipping containers of CPUs.
[658.72 --> 661.54]  And then dropping them off at a port.
[662.30 --> 664.42]  Having someone come get them.
[664.92 --> 665.94]  And give them money.
[666.62 --> 669.74]  And then get them somehow into Brazil.
[669.74 --> 670.74]  And...
[670.74 --> 673.56]  That's it.
[674.32 --> 679.40]  So much of the computer hardware that gets sold in Brazil is gray market.
[680.18 --> 682.18]  From people just smuggling in.
[682.36 --> 683.82]  Because the import prices are so high.
[683.84 --> 685.20]  Because they're so high.
[685.36 --> 688.06]  And then the retailers in other territories love it.
[688.40 --> 697.56]  Because as far as Intel ever knows, like on paper, that product is being sold within the market that they think it's being sold at.
[697.56 --> 700.20]  And that retailer is moving tremendous volume.
[700.32 --> 700.76]  Good job.
[700.84 --> 701.82]  Here's a volume incentive.
[702.44 --> 707.68]  So they can just sell the processors at cost and collect volume incentives.
[707.86 --> 709.82]  That's how the whole gray market thing works, guys.
[709.82 --> 716.02]  So sometimes the way gray market works is there will be an actual lower cost in a given territory.
[716.02 --> 721.34]  So for example, those online game key sales sites that are popping up all over the place.
[721.34 --> 727.88]  Where they're buying like Estonian game keys and then reselling them outside of that territory.
[728.08 --> 734.40]  Not technically illegal, but definitely not what I would consider to be a sustainable business model.
[734.40 --> 737.98]  I can't imagine that EA and Valve and whoever else are going to let this go on forever.
[739.26 --> 742.30]  So that is one way of gray marketing.
[742.44 --> 749.24]  And then the other way is manipulating and basically smuggling to get around import taxes.
[749.44 --> 751.64]  I know it can be a bit of an issue with Russia as well.
[751.72 --> 755.86]  I was talking to one major manufacturer a couple of months ago that basically said,
[755.98 --> 758.30]  Yeah, we can't ship anything into Russia.
[759.16 --> 760.94]  We can't even get reviews done there.
[760.94 --> 762.96]  It's just not a thing.
[763.36 --> 763.72]  Wow.
[763.82 --> 764.00]  What?
[764.60 --> 765.38]  That's weird.
[765.52 --> 767.50]  So it really depends on the product category.
[767.50 --> 768.70]  It depends on the manufacturer.
[768.88 --> 773.58]  What kind of deals they have in order to get product into countries.
[773.68 --> 774.86]  But it's not as simple.
[774.94 --> 779.98]  I mean, this is one of the reasons why I think other countries around the world look at places like the U.S.
[779.98 --> 783.56]  and go, everything's so cheap there and everything's available there.
[783.66 --> 787.02]  And part of it is that they do make it easier in a lot of ways.
[787.12 --> 790.44]  Anyone can just sell something.
[790.44 --> 791.44]  Bring stuff in.
[791.44 --> 799.56]  And as long as it doesn't require FDA approval or some kind of a UL certification for things like electronics or FCC certification,
[800.14 --> 805.82]  the processes are pretty well documented and it's pretty much under control and it's not that hard to get stuff in there.
[806.70 --> 810.48]  I talked to another hardware manufacturer about the Brazil thing.
[810.48 --> 814.70]  And they said basically the only solution for them was to build manufacturing facilities in Brazil.
[814.90 --> 817.30]  And then they were able to completely crush the competition.
[818.02 --> 819.30]  Because they didn't have to deal with it.
[819.30 --> 819.42]  No import.
[819.60 --> 824.14]  It was actually cheaper to just build manufacturing there.
[824.70 --> 826.44]  Which is maybe Brazil's agenda.
[826.44 --> 832.58]  But if they expect someone like Sony to just build a PlayStation 4 manufacturing plant in Brazil, I mean, come on.
[833.04 --> 834.64]  Not everyone's going to do that, Brazil.
[835.06 --> 839.76]  So expect people to try and circumvent your whole deal there.
[839.76 --> 841.56]  All right.
[841.56 --> 844.92]  So why don't we take a Twitter blitz, guys?
[844.98 --> 847.36]  Let's just do a general Q&A Twitter blitz.
[847.46 --> 848.06]  Hit us up.
[848.12 --> 849.54]  Let us know if you have any questions.
[850.00 --> 851.18]  We're going to go through those.
[851.24 --> 852.42]  And then we've got one more topic.
[852.56 --> 855.72]  And then around 5 o'clock our time, we're going to be joined by George from Corsair.
[855.80 --> 857.38]  So you want to launch into our next topic here?
[857.38 --> 863.08]  Just before we launch the next topic, for the Twitter blitz, if you're from Brazil, what other kind of stuff do you see this on?
[863.14 --> 867.84]  I know I took like a short ghetto vacation in Mexico.
[868.44 --> 871.72]  And I was talking to one of the guys I met there just about different electronics.
[871.72 --> 872.82]  You know, that's not really very nice.
[872.92 --> 875.00]  Is it a ghetto vacation because it was in Mexico?
[875.06 --> 875.24]  No.
[875.40 --> 877.56]  It was a ghetto vacation because I spent no money on it.
[877.64 --> 878.22]  Ah, okay.
[878.34 --> 880.36]  And lived like I was poor the whole time.
[880.44 --> 880.78]  Ah, okay.
[880.84 --> 881.68]  But it was fun.
[882.04 --> 884.64]  I just, yeah, I didn't like eat very well while I was on there.
[884.64 --> 887.06]  I was like, wow, we don't see things like that on this show.
[887.06 --> 887.80]  No, no, no.
[888.08 --> 891.26]  I met ghetto vacation because it was super cheap and I didn't get that many frills with it.
[891.78 --> 895.96]  But yeah, I was talking to a guy down there about different electronics over there.
[895.98 --> 898.00]  And he's talking about how like he had a nice phone.
[898.50 --> 900.54]  Like none of his friends had a nice phone.
[900.88 --> 904.38]  Because he's like, I'm the phone enthusiast in the group, meaning I own a nice phone.
[904.80 --> 907.20]  I was like, wow, that's different.
[907.38 --> 909.26]  Everyone I know has a super nice phone at home.
[909.36 --> 909.54]  Yep.
[909.84 --> 910.60]  Like everybody.
[910.70 --> 911.38]  It's just cheaper.
[911.76 --> 911.96]  Yeah.
[911.96 --> 914.78]  And I don't remember what it was, but I asked him how much it was.
[914.78 --> 917.50]  And then I like converted it and it was really insane.
[917.72 --> 922.42]  And for all the whining and complaining that folks do about carrier contracts and subsidies.
[922.80 --> 923.24]  Oh my God.
[923.58 --> 928.70]  I mean, do you have any idea how much of a difference that's made for you over the years in terms
[928.70 --> 930.24]  of the upfront cost of your hardware?
[930.62 --> 930.76]  Yeah.
[930.84 --> 931.70]  Can I have that drink?
[933.36 --> 933.62]  Yep.
[934.24 --> 935.06]  I didn't see it at first.
[935.14 --> 935.86]  It kind of blended in.
[936.10 --> 938.82]  NCIX gave me 10 bucks to drink from this water bottle on the show.
[938.98 --> 939.62]  I don't believe you.
[940.34 --> 941.22]  Or did they as a joke?
[941.50 --> 941.96]  No, they didn't.
[942.06 --> 942.18]  No.
[942.38 --> 943.58]  That would have been pretty funny, actually.
[943.90 --> 944.98]  No, that didn't happen.
[945.10 --> 947.06]  I just happened to own an NCIX water bottle.
[947.40 --> 948.30]  Because they gave you one.
[948.32 --> 949.16]  Because I worked there for years.
[949.22 --> 949.68]  Yeah, exactly.
[949.78 --> 950.26]  That makes sense.
[950.72 --> 954.56]  Anyways, the new topic was the Apple event and new TechQuickie format.
[954.56 --> 957.70]  Yeah, we'll talk about the Apple event first.
[957.80 --> 959.24]  The TechQuickie format isn't really new.
[959.66 --> 966.46]  So Apple had about an 80-minute event earlier this week where they actually talked about some
[966.46 --> 967.30]  pretty cool stuff.
[967.42 --> 969.76]  So the new iPad Air.
[970.30 --> 970.76]  Air.
[971.00 --> 971.88]  iPad Air.
[972.48 --> 973.64]  Thinner than before.
[974.24 --> 975.32]  Lighter than before.
[975.70 --> 978.10]  I wonder when they're going to run out of reusable names.
[978.38 --> 983.48]  The same phone hardware in a much larger form factor as before.
[983.48 --> 984.90]  iPad Air Pod.
[985.16 --> 985.60]  Air Pod.
[985.80 --> 986.66]  That would be great.
[987.26 --> 987.50]  I...
[987.50 --> 987.82]  I...
[987.82 --> 988.26]  I...
[988.26 --> 989.14]  I...
[989.14 --> 989.58]  I...
[989.58 --> 991.16]  Poed?
[991.66 --> 992.44]  iPod Air Pad?
[992.54 --> 993.26]  iPod Air Pad.
[993.56 --> 993.88]  Anyway.
[994.12 --> 995.56]  So the iPad Air is out.
[995.64 --> 996.44]  It's only a pound.
[996.60 --> 999.42]  So it's significantly lighter than the previous generation model.
[999.52 --> 1000.24]  It's still Retina.
[1000.58 --> 1005.12]  It uses the same A7 chip that we found in the latest iPhone 5S.
[1005.12 --> 1009.50]  So they have, by the look of things, done away with having a higher tier of hardware.
[1009.62 --> 1010.90]  An iPad versus iPhone.
[1011.08 --> 1012.72]  I guess there's just no point anymore.
[1012.72 --> 1016.58]  And other than that, I don't think there was really much to say about that.
[1016.66 --> 1018.78]  There's new cases available in a variety of colors.
[1018.94 --> 1024.74]  And now, rather than only magical cases that go just on the front, there are now magical
[1024.74 --> 1028.80]  cases that wrap all the way around your thin and light iPad to make it exactly the same
[1028.80 --> 1031.40]  weight and size as your previous generation iPad.
[1031.70 --> 1034.02]  I don't know that it's actually exactly the same weight and size.
[1034.08 --> 1036.90]  And if you're anything like me, you probably already had a case on your last generation
[1036.90 --> 1037.20]  iPad.
[1037.36 --> 1038.28]  So it's still a savings.
[1038.28 --> 1040.76]  But I just kind of get a kick out of that.
[1040.86 --> 1042.02]  Unless you drop your keys on it.
[1042.14 --> 1042.36]  All right.
[1042.42 --> 1046.58]  The next big thing is the MacBook Pro with Retina gets a Haswell upgrade.
[1046.74 --> 1050.56]  So for those of you who have been sleeping under a rock for the last however many months,
[1050.64 --> 1056.24]  Haswell is basically better performance, better battery life, and lower power consumption,
[1056.24 --> 1058.28]  which ties pretty nicely into better battery life.
[1058.40 --> 1058.92]  Laptops.
[1059.46 --> 1061.56]  Dramatically improved onboard graphics.
[1061.72 --> 1067.00]  So the new Pro is available in the 15-inch model with Iris Pro and Crystal Well.
[1067.16 --> 1070.60]  So Crystal Well, for those of you who aren't familiar with it, this one, I'm not going to
[1070.60 --> 1074.00]  say you were living under a rock because it's not that bad to not know this.
[1074.00 --> 1082.32]  But Crystal Well is basically 128 megs of extra cache that can be used not only by the CPU
[1082.32 --> 1088.70]  component, but also the GPU component, which is fascinating because it's a straight, rather
[1088.70 --> 1091.26]  than, it's a straight overflow, pretty much.
[1091.42 --> 1096.44]  So anything that just falls out of level three goes straight into this 128 meg cache.
[1096.52 --> 1097.62]  It's a massive cache.
[1097.62 --> 1101.14]  It sits somewhere in speed between level three cache and RAM.
[1101.96 --> 1106.52]  And because it's simply an overflow, and obviously anything that overflows from level three is
[1106.52 --> 1110.78]  something that you were recently using, it is very efficiently used.
[1111.16 --> 1115.42]  And then the fact that it can be leveraged for the GPU as well, for the integrated GPU,
[1116.08 --> 1117.60]  is game-changing.
[1117.72 --> 1124.08]  It is no secret that no matter who you ask, whether it's Intel or AMD, they're going to say
[1124.08 --> 1130.26]  the future is CPUs and GPUs working together on every task that you perform.
[1130.88 --> 1131.88]  OpenCL is a thing.
[1132.68 --> 1133.86]  And the new...
[1133.86 --> 1134.66]  It's a thing.
[1136.04 --> 1136.98]  I can't even...
[1136.98 --> 1141.72]  The new Mavericks version of OS X has full support for OpenCL, and they're claiming up
[1141.72 --> 1144.54]  to 1.8x performance in supported tasks.
[1145.00 --> 1150.82]  And given the way that Apple ties the software and the hardware together so well, I would expect
[1150.82 --> 1154.72]  to see OpenCL actually make a difference on that platform before we see it making much
[1154.72 --> 1155.92]  of a difference on other platforms.
[1156.04 --> 1159.48]  Well, it makes sense because they don't have much hardware and much software to sync, which
[1159.48 --> 1160.32]  helps a lot.
[1160.38 --> 1164.14]  It's part of the reason why it's so hard for all other platforms, because there's so many
[1164.14 --> 1167.64]  basically infinite different combinations of hardware you could have it installed on.
[1168.06 --> 1170.70]  One thing about Mavericks, too, and a bunch of their...
[1170.70 --> 1173.94]  All their other software notifications that I heard about during the show.
[1174.24 --> 1174.90]  Yeah, iWork.
[1174.90 --> 1175.58]  So they're all...
[1175.58 --> 1177.02]  Yeah, iWork, Mavericks.
[1177.46 --> 1178.36]  Was there anything else?
[1178.36 --> 1180.58]  Um, I can't remember.
[1180.78 --> 1182.70]  iWork, Mavericks, and possibly other things.
[1182.78 --> 1183.48]  Anything software.
[1183.60 --> 1186.28]  Lots of software that neither of us have ever used before.
[1186.62 --> 1187.02]  I have.
[1187.12 --> 1187.44]  Have you?
[1187.60 --> 1188.06]  How is it?
[1188.38 --> 1188.88]  It sucks.
[1189.14 --> 1189.30]  Okay.
[1189.52 --> 1190.94]  But it might not have actually been bad.
[1190.98 --> 1192.34]  It just sucked because I don't know how to use a Mac.
[1192.34 --> 1193.08]  It's apparently better now.
[1193.58 --> 1195.74]  That's good, and it's free, and today.
[1196.12 --> 1203.30]  Yeah, so if you buy any Mac hardware, you now get iWork for free, and if you own any Mac
[1203.30 --> 1207.78]  OS going back like the last five years, you get an upgrade to Mavericks for free.
[1207.78 --> 1212.38]  So software is now officially free if you're willing to pay the Apple tax for your hardware,
[1212.58 --> 1217.28]  which, as I've noted on this show before, at launch usually isn't that bad, and the
[1217.28 --> 1221.82]  new MacBook Pros are cheaper by about $200 for base configs versus the outgoing models.
[1222.20 --> 1222.48]  Right.
[1222.48 --> 1225.22]  None of these are necessarily terrible things.
[1225.28 --> 1225.88]  Imagine that.
[1226.48 --> 1226.74]  Yeah.
[1226.86 --> 1227.20]  Oh, yeah.
[1227.26 --> 1232.50]  The other thing is Apple's showing their commitment to, you know, greener everything, so they had
[1232.50 --> 1235.74]  lists of all the different, you know, reduction of hazardous substances and all that.
[1235.82 --> 1237.82]  The new Mac Pro, they talked a little bit more about it.
[1237.82 --> 1243.32]  It's going to be assembled in the U.S., which is, you know, it's only one product, and it's
[1243.32 --> 1249.18]  not going to make us forget about the explosions in the factories of iPad polishing workers
[1249.18 --> 1251.42]  with all the aluminum dust and people dying.
[1251.54 --> 1253.42]  No, we haven't forgotten about that, but...
[1254.56 --> 1255.90]  At least they're moving towards it.
[1256.00 --> 1258.26]  You can't criticize a step in the right direction.
[1258.36 --> 1262.46]  No, and if they're going to start with this, maybe they'll get some more factories, more
[1262.46 --> 1265.24]  plants, more supervisors, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, over time.
[1265.24 --> 1272.76]  And, I mean, honestly, we as consumers have to prove that we're willing to pay more for
[1272.76 --> 1277.64]  something that is, you know, assembled, at least assembled in our home country, or not
[1277.64 --> 1279.24]  our home country, but someone's home country.
[1279.36 --> 1284.14]  We have to prove that we're willing to pay more for it for companies to be willing to
[1284.14 --> 1288.36]  invest in moving production back onto their home turf.
[1288.54 --> 1290.00]  And I don't blame them for that.
[1290.06 --> 1291.40]  They have to sell product.
[1291.40 --> 1293.06]  If they don't sell product, they won't exist.
[1293.06 --> 1298.06]  And then someone else will outsource to overseas, and it doesn't fix it.
[1298.28 --> 1300.76]  Yeah, and that's the first thing so many companies do.
[1301.16 --> 1302.02]  Increase profit margins?
[1302.60 --> 1303.04]  Overseas!
[1303.42 --> 1305.96]  Let's get it out of the States, because it costs so much to actually manufacture.
[1306.10 --> 1307.32]  I ended up just punching that thing.
[1307.44 --> 1307.70]  Yeah.
[1308.02 --> 1309.50]  Just punch all the things!
[1309.92 --> 1310.72]  We're angry!
[1310.82 --> 1311.66]  Increase profits!
[1311.82 --> 1312.42]  Punch things!
[1312.64 --> 1312.96]  Yes.
[1314.00 --> 1316.00]  All right, so here we go, guys.
[1316.10 --> 1317.64]  It's Twitter Blitz time!
[1317.64 --> 1323.18]  So, Jacob says, you should get a Lego Mindstorm EV3.
[1323.86 --> 1325.38]  Lego Mindstorms are actually really cool.
[1325.84 --> 1330.62]  Yeah, I just don't know that that's necessarily our video sort of approach.
[1330.76 --> 1331.60]  They are really cool, though.
[1331.86 --> 1335.30]  Eventually, Apple will have to call the next iPod Touch the iTouch Kids.
[1335.52 --> 1336.94]  It will be hilarious when it happens.
[1338.74 --> 1339.44]  Oh, gosh.
[1339.48 --> 1340.36]  That's terrible, Ben.
[1340.46 --> 1341.34]  That is horrible.
[1341.34 --> 1342.04]  That's terrible.
[1342.56 --> 1345.24]  What is that keyboard you guys have with the red translucent keys?
[1345.40 --> 1346.52]  I know where you can buy it.
[1346.58 --> 1350.72]  You can buy it on banggood.com, which isn't as bad as it sounds, but they do have, like,
[1350.78 --> 1351.64]  sex toys and stuff.
[1352.34 --> 1353.00]  What's it called again?
[1353.26 --> 1354.22]  I don't remember.
[1354.30 --> 1354.82]  I don't remember.
[1355.54 --> 1358.12]  It's got a crazy name, and most of it's not in English.
[1358.24 --> 1360.16]  What do you think of a carbon fiber wrap 900D?
[1360.20 --> 1363.58]  As long as the carbon fiber wrap doesn't weigh much more, then it's probably fine.
[1363.96 --> 1365.06]  Man, that's a heavy case.
[1365.06 --> 1368.66]  We'll have to rag on George a little bit about that when he gets on.
[1369.46 --> 1370.50]  Mantle versus G-Sync?
[1370.50 --> 1371.30]  Oh, trust me.
[1371.34 --> 1372.54]  We'll be talking about this later.
[1372.72 --> 1373.26]  There's a segment coming.
[1373.52 --> 1375.64]  Which do you think is a better advancement in technology?
[1375.78 --> 1377.78]  Okay, I gotta save that.
[1377.88 --> 1378.26]  Yeah.
[1378.62 --> 1380.46]  Apparently it's Nokia, not Nokia.
[1381.04 --> 1381.28]  Okay.
[1383.78 --> 1384.22]  Nikon.
[1384.76 --> 1385.20]  Nikon.
[1385.20 --> 1385.24]  Nikon.
[1385.24 --> 1385.72]  Nikon.
[1385.82 --> 1386.18]  I don't know.
[1386.98 --> 1388.38]  In English, it's Nokia.
[1389.76 --> 1394.08]  So if I were to read it phonetically, but I'm sorry if I have broken the rules.
[1394.40 --> 1394.74]  Nokia.
[1394.74 --> 1394.82]  Yeah.
[1395.48 --> 1400.22]  Can people in Brazil go to Colombia or Mexico and get a PS4 for $400?
[1400.54 --> 1403.24]  Now, I think a lot of South American countries have similar problems.
[1403.56 --> 1406.42]  I don't know specifically if Colombia does or Mexico.
[1406.72 --> 1407.92]  I'm pretty sure it's more expensive.
[1408.08 --> 1411.56]  If it's the same as laptops and stuff, it'll be more expensive in Mexico.
[1412.34 --> 1412.74]  All right.
[1412.78 --> 1414.44]  How do you think the 780 Ti?
[1414.58 --> 1415.06]  No idea.
[1415.20 --> 1416.34]  780 Ti is not out yet.
[1416.42 --> 1417.94]  Even if we knew, we couldn't talk about it.
[1418.24 --> 1419.04]  What to upgrade?
[1419.16 --> 1420.16]  My GTX 680.
[1420.16 --> 1421.06]  You know what?
[1421.42 --> 1424.28]  We have another, ah, we have a great discussion topic on that as well.
[1424.38 --> 1430.98]  The slowing of the pace of technology advancements, particularly as it pertains to graphics cards.
[1431.14 --> 1435.08]  So there's not a whole lot to upgrade at GTX 680 to right now.
[1436.12 --> 1438.30]  Will NVIDIA graphics card support Mantle in the future?
[1438.54 --> 1438.76]  No.
[1439.50 --> 1442.60]  Also, will G-Sync be worth getting against maybe an AMD Mantle card?
[1442.72 --> 1443.74]  More discussion on that later.
[1443.84 --> 1444.40]  Oh my goodness.
[1444.42 --> 1446.80]  Everyone just wants to talk about Mantle and G-Sync.
[1446.90 --> 1447.74]  Trust me, we will.
[1447.74 --> 1448.98]  We'll talk about it for a while.
[1448.98 --> 1449.64]  We'll talk about it.
[1449.72 --> 1450.90]  Tuning in from the North Pole.
[1451.02 --> 1451.52]  Very nice.
[1451.62 --> 1452.26]  That's pretty cool.
[1452.50 --> 1454.28]  I'm not clicking a Bitly link in Twitter though.
[1454.54 --> 1454.84]  Scary.
[1455.14 --> 1458.32]  Matrix edition of ASUS GPUs are designed mainly for overclocking, right?
[1458.56 --> 1459.94]  What extras does it deliver?
[1461.74 --> 1464.84]  Um, well, mostly overclocking.
[1465.98 --> 1466.34]  Yeah.
[1466.50 --> 1467.30]  Yeah, better cooling.
[1467.38 --> 1469.14]  Better cooling, sometimes better power delivery.
[1470.42 --> 1472.38]  We've seen that a little bit on ASUS GPUs, I believe.
[1472.60 --> 1474.34]  Apparently it's lagging a little bit on and off.
[1474.34 --> 1475.34]  Yeah, we're aware.
[1475.54 --> 1477.62]  Not really sure what's going on with that.
[1477.62 --> 1478.92]  I think we're at a lower bit rate of the stream.
[1479.56 --> 1481.12]  Yeah, we could try that.
[1481.24 --> 1484.28]  So I'm pretty sure I moved it back up to 2500 for the last stream.
[1484.78 --> 1485.48]  Hello from Greece.
[1485.52 --> 1485.96]  How's Rocket?
[1486.02 --> 1486.38]  He's good.
[1486.44 --> 1487.54]  He's putting on weight already.
[1488.64 --> 1491.44]  And what do you think can be improved on a second version of the Pebble?
[1491.96 --> 1493.94]  You know, do they have colored E-Ink screens?
[1496.62 --> 1497.02]  No?
[1497.40 --> 1498.32]  I don't think so.
[1498.50 --> 1499.12]  I haven't heard.
[1499.22 --> 1501.14]  I don't know, but I haven't heard of any.
[1501.44 --> 1505.48]  Guys, tweet us or let me know in the Twitch chat if they have colored E-Ink.
[1505.60 --> 1506.34]  I'll watch Twitch chat.
[1506.40 --> 1506.86]  You keep going.
[1506.94 --> 1507.68]  I don't think so.
[1508.32 --> 1508.94]  But, um...
[1508.94 --> 1510.20]  I just banned someone on accident.
[1510.50 --> 1511.28]  I'm going to undo...
[1511.28 --> 1512.72]  Penance81.
[1513.00 --> 1516.20]  I put my hand down on my touchpad and timed you out for 10 minutes.
[1516.54 --> 1517.10]  I'm sorry.
[1517.18 --> 1518.04]  I don't know how to undo that.
[1518.10 --> 1519.36]  If any of the mods know how, that'd be great.
[1519.36 --> 1523.00]  Uh, Owen asks, uh, thoughts on which pair of Skullcandies you may want to review?
[1523.16 --> 1527.84]  I'm going to pick up the Aviators at some point here because apparently they actually
[1527.84 --> 1528.48]  don't suck.
[1529.18 --> 1529.74]  I've heard.
[1529.90 --> 1530.12]  Yeah.
[1530.32 --> 1530.58]  Okay.
[1530.62 --> 1531.46]  So I'm going to pick up those.
[1531.56 --> 1535.76]  And then for LOLs, I'm going to grab, like, some of their, like, $80 earbuds.
[1536.14 --> 1537.10]  And then just be like, they suck.
[1537.10 --> 1540.20]  And then I'm just going to be like, yeah, they're terrible because I think we all knew
[1540.20 --> 1540.62]  that was coming.
[1540.62 --> 1541.74]  But the Aviators, I...
[1541.74 --> 1542.66]  I've heard they're great.
[1542.82 --> 1548.40]  I've heard they are great, but I heard they're just as good in way cheaper price brackets.
[1549.36 --> 1549.96]  Well...
[1549.96 --> 1551.44]  I don't know if that's actually a thing or not.
[1551.52 --> 1552.34]  I've just heard that.
[1552.44 --> 1552.68]  Okay.
[1552.76 --> 1555.82]  But you do pay a premium for real brand names, so to speak.
[1555.84 --> 1556.22]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1556.26 --> 1557.62]  I mean, I'm okay with that.
[1557.82 --> 1558.38]  I buy...
[1558.38 --> 1559.94]  When's the last time you bought headphones?
[1560.04 --> 1561.70]  Did you buy No Name or did you buy Bear Dynamic?
[1561.98 --> 1562.74]  Well, I bought Bear Dynamic.
[1563.20 --> 1563.66]  There you go.
[1564.24 --> 1565.32]  But these are like...
[1565.32 --> 1565.74]  Ah, yeah.
[1565.74 --> 1565.94]  Okay.
[1567.18 --> 1567.94]  Not really.
[1568.86 --> 1573.54]  Do you think we will eventually see an AMD or NVIDIA flavor of SteamOS since the source
[1573.54 --> 1574.20]  will be available to anyone?
[1574.32 --> 1574.48]  No.
[1575.16 --> 1576.66]  Because they'll just use SteamOS.
[1576.82 --> 1577.10]  Yeah.
[1577.30 --> 1578.78]  With AMD or NVIDIA drivers.
[1578.78 --> 1583.46]  In fact, I think NVIDIA is going a completely different route, and they're chasing the Android.
[1584.70 --> 1589.94]  More on that, but their new console mode for Shield looks outstanding.
[1590.28 --> 1594.92]  I basically don't need a home theater PC anymore, and I've had one for years.
[1595.76 --> 1597.48]  I'm a huge home theater PC guy.
[1597.56 --> 1599.22]  I will be replacing it with an NVIDIA Shield.
[1600.48 --> 1601.00]  All right.
[1601.12 --> 1603.10]  What is the keyboard you guys have with the red translucent?
[1603.24 --> 1603.64]  Oh, okay.
[1603.64 --> 1604.90]  That's a beautiful tweet.
[1605.34 --> 1606.88]  Do you want to bring George in?
[1607.12 --> 1607.26]  Sure.
[1607.26 --> 1608.86]  Because I think we're pretty much ready to go.
[1609.44 --> 1610.84]  Where does my team speed keep going?
[1611.00 --> 1611.98]  Very exciting.
[1613.36 --> 1613.88]  All right.
[1614.02 --> 1615.64]  $79.90 versus $7.80.
[1615.76 --> 1617.44]  Same price, but slightly older tech.
[1617.54 --> 1618.42]  $79.90.
[1618.56 --> 1622.48]  Raw performance is going to be pretty darn good.
[1622.48 --> 1631.82]  But until AMD completely fixes their frame timings issues, I would probably lean towards the $7.80.
[1631.92 --> 1638.16]  With that said, if you check out the latest article on PCPR, where Ryan's got $290Xs running in Crossfire,
[1638.84 --> 1644.24]  they are making some pretty major strides on the driver development side getting that issue taken care of.
[1644.24 --> 1649.96]  So are we live with the one, the only George?
[1650.90 --> 1651.38]  Hey, guys.
[1651.44 --> 1651.74]  What's up?
[1652.18 --> 1652.94]  Hey, George.
[1653.00 --> 1653.48]  How are you?
[1654.32 --> 1654.88]  Doing good.
[1655.26 --> 1655.80]  Doing good.
[1655.82 --> 1657.56]  My volume isn't doing so good.
[1657.62 --> 1658.60]  So give me just a second here.
[1658.66 --> 1660.42]  I'm going to try and turn you in a little bit so I can do it.
[1660.82 --> 1662.14]  That is a handsome picture.
[1662.84 --> 1664.38]  That is a very handsome picture.
[1664.42 --> 1665.52]  Where did we get this picture?
[1665.76 --> 1666.42]  I didn't get it.
[1666.76 --> 1667.28]  Oh, okay.
[1667.28 --> 1673.44]  Well, apparently one of my guys picked out this picture of you, and you can share your appreciation with him if you'd like.
[1673.50 --> 1674.16]  I'll pass it along.
[1674.24 --> 1676.76]  All right.
[1676.84 --> 1677.16]  Thanks.
[1678.22 --> 1679.76]  So tell us about yourself.
[1679.88 --> 1680.32]  Where are you from?
[1680.40 --> 1682.16]  What kind of cases have you gotten your fingers into?
[1682.30 --> 1682.98]  All that kind of stuff.
[1684.86 --> 1685.26]  Okay.
[1685.42 --> 1690.66]  I started Corsair about 10 years ago, nine and a half years ago, doing memory test crap.
[1690.96 --> 1694.14]  And then I just got really opinionated in meetings.
[1694.34 --> 1697.60]  And basically they said, okay, well, let's see if George actually knows what he's talking about.
[1697.86 --> 1699.70]  And occasionally I did.
[1699.70 --> 1704.22]  So as long as my success rate is better than my fail rate, they keep listening.
[1705.04 --> 1705.98]  That's basically it.
[1706.98 --> 1707.72]  So, yeah.
[1707.72 --> 1715.68]  I started, I actually got the job because I saw a post on a hardware review site that said Corsair was looking for memory test guys.
[1715.68 --> 1717.06]  And they happened to be local.
[1717.24 --> 1718.88]  So I just sent an email saying, hey, I'm interested.
[1719.08 --> 1720.26]  And I got the job.
[1720.26 --> 1727.50]  So, you know, you can just kind of move from being a fan of hardware stuff into making hardware if you actually pay attention.
[1727.50 --> 1728.62]  You know what?
[1728.66 --> 1730.20]  That is a fantastic story.
[1730.62 --> 1736.58]  And that's one of the things that I think is really inspiring for our viewers to hear.
[1736.90 --> 1744.62]  Because a lot of them will reach out to me and ask me things like, you know, hey, Linus, how I'm trying to, I'm trying to.
[1746.02 --> 1746.74]  That's interesting.
[1746.86 --> 1747.30]  Where is it?
[1747.30 --> 1749.42]  I'm having a little bit of trouble hearing you here.
[1749.52 --> 1755.14]  And I think that I'm missing the connector from my earphones.
[1755.28 --> 1756.32]  Here, you keep going.
[1756.52 --> 1756.72]  Okay.
[1756.82 --> 1757.14]  All right.
[1757.70 --> 1758.84]  So, I mean, I think that's really.
[1758.96 --> 1760.94]  It might be because you're using like Razer headset.
[1760.94 --> 1766.52]  Yeah, I don't know what the impedance of these is.
[1766.68 --> 1769.24]  But maybe it's a touch higher than I was expecting.
[1769.66 --> 1769.94]  No.
[1770.92 --> 1772.38]  I don't think that's the issue.
[1772.48 --> 1774.48]  I think it might be to do with our splitter here.
[1774.58 --> 1780.32]  But for some reason, the end connector of my SteelSeries earbuds, which are also not Corsair.
[1780.40 --> 1782.30]  Although you guys don't make earbuds for what that's worth.
[1782.86 --> 1783.14]  All right.
[1783.16 --> 1784.40]  Anyway, I think that's inspiring.
[1784.52 --> 1785.38]  I think that's really cool.
[1785.46 --> 1787.58]  And I think viewers love hearing stories like that.
[1787.58 --> 1797.82]  What were some of the challenges that you faced going from being a peon to being, well, the key guy when it comes to designing Corsair cases?
[1803.84 --> 1806.98]  Actually, so my first thing I started with was power supplies.
[1807.24 --> 1810.98]  Because they just expanded into like USB drives.
[1811.60 --> 1815.82]  And then someone sent an email saying, do you think power supplies?
[1815.82 --> 1820.12]  Actually, our president, Andy, asked an email saying, do you guys think we should do power supplies?
[1820.94 --> 1823.40]  And I was relatively new.
[1823.48 --> 1824.74]  And I was like, yeah, we should do power supplies.
[1824.84 --> 1825.82]  And here's what we should do.
[1825.88 --> 1829.48]  And here's what the connector should be and all that stuff.
[1829.68 --> 1831.36]  And I specced it all out.
[1831.44 --> 1835.16]  And then I got another email saying, OK, you work with this guy and start building it.
[1835.20 --> 1837.60]  And then that became really successful.
[1837.90 --> 1839.66]  So now we're like the number one guy in power supplies.
[1839.80 --> 1844.04]  So they said, OK, well, when we do new products that are like that, like cases or power supplies or coolers,
[1844.04 --> 1846.40]  you should be the guy involved.
[1847.08 --> 1853.74]  So the challenge is really is just like actually trying to learn the logistics and manufacturing side stuff,
[1853.86 --> 1854.92]  which is actually kind of difficult.
[1856.08 --> 1863.00]  Yeah, it's I think that people don't have nearly enough appreciation for I remember.
[1863.24 --> 1863.80]  You know what?
[1863.84 --> 1864.78]  This reminds me.
[1864.88 --> 1868.24]  I saw I saw I think it was back on Extreme Systems.
[1868.38 --> 1870.76]  Some guy designed an ultimate case.
[1870.76 --> 1875.24]  It was kind of based on a TJ07 ish like design.
[1875.82 --> 1879.42]  And it had all this radiator space and it had all this stuff about it.
[1879.72 --> 1882.46]  And I looked at the thing and I kind of went, dude, that's unmanufacturable.
[1882.88 --> 1884.16]  And he went, you know what?
[1884.20 --> 1885.84]  You're not supporting my dream.
[1885.92 --> 1886.60]  You're this, you're that.
[1886.66 --> 1890.76]  And I'm kind of sitting there going, you don't understand the challenges at play here.
[1891.04 --> 1891.42]  You know what?
[1891.50 --> 1891.90]  Why don't you?
[1892.36 --> 1894.70]  Now that it's been a long time, now that it's been a while,
[1894.70 --> 1900.36]  tell us about the biggest problem you had bringing 800D to market.
[1904.48 --> 1904.88]  Okay.
[1905.00 --> 1908.88]  So the first case, 800D was kind of funny because we didn't really know anything about
[1908.88 --> 1912.52]  always done memory and USB drives,
[1912.56 --> 1914.88]  which you can put in like a little clamshell or a box
[1914.88 --> 1917.34]  and you put it in another bigger box and then you put it on an airplane
[1917.34 --> 1919.28]  and fly it across the planet.
[1919.28 --> 1924.92]  The challenge with the 800D was never built anything so complex mechanically
[1924.92 --> 1926.48]  because it had so many different types.
[1927.14 --> 1932.06]  Actually getting like 800Ds from the factory in China to other people
[1932.06 --> 1935.18]  that wanted to buy them became a huge nightmare.
[1935.42 --> 1937.72]  Like it turns out you can't put those on an airplane and fly them around.
[1937.84 --> 1938.92]  That's a really bad idea.
[1939.44 --> 1941.60]  So it costs way too much to do that.
[1941.68 --> 1944.72]  So you ended up trying to do container optimization and stuff like that for boats,
[1944.84 --> 1946.68]  which is actually, it's boring for you guys.
[1946.68 --> 1949.94]  But, you know, these are what guys who like sell mattresses and refrigerators
[1949.94 --> 1953.00]  have to figure out how to ship giant things across the country.
[1953.44 --> 1954.64]  Right, or across the world.
[1956.50 --> 1957.86]  Yeah, exactly.
[1957.96 --> 1959.56]  It's actually really challenging to figure that out.
[1959.64 --> 1961.54]  So like one of the things we learned, for example,
[1961.94 --> 1964.00]  if you look at the 650D and the 600T,
[1964.28 --> 1966.22]  they were the second and third cases we designed
[1966.22 --> 1968.64]  and they had the same internals,
[1968.74 --> 1970.58]  but they're very different external dimensions.
[1970.78 --> 1975.68]  Like the outside of the 600T is a lot bigger than the 650D.
[1976.68 --> 1980.82]  So it actually costs 650D,
[1981.18 --> 1984.04]  which is, again, to the end user, you guys don't care.
[1984.12 --> 1986.48]  You just pick it up and put it in your car and drive home or whatever
[1986.48 --> 1989.20]  or have it delivered by, you know, NCX or Newegg or whoever.
[1989.72 --> 1991.18]  But, you know, for us, that's like,
[1991.24 --> 1993.60]  okay, well, can we fit 500 or 700 in a container?
[1993.86 --> 1995.24]  That's the type of question we have to answer.
[1995.38 --> 1997.10]  Right, and container shipping is not cheap.
[1997.10 --> 1997.44]  Interesting thing.
[1997.52 --> 2001.38]  The feature set stuff, no, it's challenging too.
[2002.18 --> 2003.96]  So I mean, that's a really boring answer,
[2003.96 --> 2007.46]  but the other side of it is that for the specs,
[2007.58 --> 2010.04]  we can just ask you guys what to build and you guys tell us.
[2010.08 --> 2011.44]  So that's really easy because we can just say,
[2011.52 --> 2013.62]  hey, should we put, you know, four hard drive bays or six?
[2014.32 --> 2018.82]  And then, you know, the answer is we can put whatever you guys tell us.
[2019.32 --> 2019.72]  Right.
[2019.96 --> 2023.76]  So speaking of putting a case in your car and driving home with it,
[2023.96 --> 2027.14]  900D, that barely fits in my car.
[2027.50 --> 2030.94]  Did you go through this whole challenge again with 900D
[2030.94 --> 2034.56]  of convincing people at Corsair that you needed to build this case?
[2035.22 --> 2037.58]  And has it been successful in your eyes?
[2038.06 --> 2038.36]  Yeah.
[2040.64 --> 2041.66]  Yeah, we totally did.
[2041.82 --> 2045.00]  We had to convince our president, Andy,
[2045.08 --> 2047.92]  that we needed a successor to 800D,
[2048.18 --> 2049.92]  which was, you know, this giant case.
[2050.04 --> 2052.36]  And we had to argue that, hey, guys look online.
[2052.46 --> 2053.90]  These guys want more radiator space.
[2053.90 --> 2055.64]  They want bigger motherboards, all these things.
[2056.26 --> 2058.34]  And so, you know, we said, okay, it's been three years.
[2058.38 --> 2058.86]  Let's do it.
[2058.94 --> 2063.36]  And it took a long time because it's actually not an inexpensive chassis to make either.
[2063.36 --> 2064.76]  Like tooling it up costs a lot of money.
[2065.26 --> 2066.98]  So when we can sit there and say, and then he goes,
[2067.06 --> 2068.46]  well, how many can you sell in a month?
[2068.52 --> 2069.80]  And then you have to answer that.
[2070.02 --> 2072.74]  So the business side of it is the interesting part.
[2072.82 --> 2075.48]  But the 900D making it even bigger, you know,
[2075.50 --> 2077.62]  when we saw the 800D was so big when we launched it,
[2077.64 --> 2079.32]  people were like laughing at how big it was.
[2079.38 --> 2081.44]  Now 900D makes 800D look like a mid-tower.
[2081.72 --> 2086.16]  So it's still kind of overkill, but we've seen a lot of traction from it.
[2086.20 --> 2089.06]  A lot of guys are buying it because they really wanted that water cooling room.
[2089.88 --> 2091.44]  Now, I don't know if you saw it.
[2091.44 --> 2093.82]  Did you see our overkill water cooling build guide
[2093.82 --> 2096.34]  where we stuffed five radiators into the 900D?
[2096.46 --> 2097.40]  Five thick radiators?
[2099.78 --> 2101.98]  I think I did see that, actually.
[2102.84 --> 2104.34]  We had to do...
[2104.34 --> 2105.04]  One of those things that...
[2105.04 --> 2107.64]  We had to fight with it a little bit,
[2107.78 --> 2112.62]  which was kind of funny to me because I stupidly looked at the side of the box
[2112.62 --> 2114.90]  and I saw all the different radiator support things
[2114.90 --> 2119.14]  and it didn't occur to me that you couldn't necessarily fit all of those in
[2119.14 --> 2121.54]  all at the same time in the default configuration.
[2121.90 --> 2124.36]  So we ended up taking one of the radiators
[2124.36 --> 2126.50]  and actually mounting it to the motherboard tray.
[2127.06 --> 2129.08]  So was that something you expected people to do?
[2129.08 --> 2137.10]  No, I didn't quite expect that to be achieved in that way.
[2137.20 --> 2138.18]  I see how you guys did that.
[2138.58 --> 2140.94]  I'm looking at the YouTube video on the other window.
[2142.10 --> 2144.08]  That's pretty clever, actually.
[2144.50 --> 2146.78]  But man, those are some really ugly fans.
[2146.78 --> 2151.68]  I know, man, but they're really good.
[2151.88 --> 2154.80]  I mean, I don't expect you to acknowledge that.
[2154.90 --> 2155.40]  That's fine.
[2155.54 --> 2156.08]  That's fine.
[2156.16 --> 2157.10]  I understand that.
[2157.22 --> 2160.86]  But they're extremely quiet and the performance is outstanding.
[2161.66 --> 2163.54]  And I know you guys know that.
[2165.56 --> 2168.74]  So you control me all you want, but I know you know that they're good.
[2169.84 --> 2170.34]  All right.
[2170.50 --> 2173.02]  So I guess the last thing here is...
[2173.02 --> 2173.74]  Yeah, they're pretty good.
[2173.74 --> 2178.90]  For those of you in the audience who don't know what Corsair is all about,
[2179.04 --> 2181.32]  George, what makes Corsair different from other companies?
[2189.96 --> 2192.48]  I lost you guys' audio there for some reason.
[2192.64 --> 2192.96]  Oh, okay.
[2193.02 --> 2195.70]  I said, George, what makes Corsair different from other companies?
[2200.60 --> 2202.36]  I would have to say that internally,
[2202.36 --> 2205.46]  we have a group of engineers that kind of run everything.
[2205.78 --> 2210.00]  So like the directors and executives are all trained engineers,
[2210.20 --> 2213.36]  which makes it very different from...
[2218.66 --> 2220.60]  Oh, hold on a second, George.
[2221.66 --> 2222.54]  You know what?
[2222.64 --> 2223.28]  Hold on a second.
[2223.84 --> 2224.52]  Are you on Wi-Fi?
[2225.96 --> 2226.28]  No.
[2226.96 --> 2228.38]  Not you, George.
[2228.38 --> 2231.66]  I think that's the problem.
[2232.00 --> 2235.02]  Give us one second here.
[2236.22 --> 2236.94]  How can...
[2236.94 --> 2237.54]  Join the other one.
[2237.72 --> 2238.36]  Yeah, I'm on it.
[2238.40 --> 2238.58]  Okay.
[2238.78 --> 2241.30]  We'll be back with George in just a moment.
[2241.40 --> 2243.56]  So in the meantime, those of you watching,
[2243.72 --> 2246.18]  I would love for you to tweet us.
[2246.34 --> 2248.12]  So tweet at LinusTech
[2248.12 --> 2251.00]  and let us know any questions that you have for George.
[2251.00 --> 2253.16]  Once we've gotten through a couple more topics,
[2253.60 --> 2255.00]  we are going to go ahead and...
[2256.16 --> 2257.36]  I'm working on it.
[2257.40 --> 2257.88]  You're working on it.
[2257.88 --> 2258.06]  Okay.
[2258.20 --> 2261.32]  We're going to go ahead and have George answer some of those questions for you
[2261.32 --> 2263.14]  in a Twitter blitz type format.
[2263.32 --> 2267.28]  So we should be back with him here in just a couple of moments.
[2267.28 --> 2272.62]  We are connecting to our Cisco hotspot,
[2272.76 --> 2275.12]  which should be able to connect,
[2275.22 --> 2277.68]  but for whatever reason is unable to connect.
[2278.40 --> 2278.92]  You have...
[2278.92 --> 2279.18]  Okay.
[2279.24 --> 2281.56]  We are going to go ahead and we're going to go through my phone
[2281.56 --> 2283.82]  because apparently that's a better solution
[2283.82 --> 2286.68]  than trying to use Wi-Fi for some reason.
[2286.92 --> 2287.16]  All right.
[2287.42 --> 2289.24]  So that should show up in just a moment here.
[2291.64 --> 2292.48]  All right.
[2292.88 --> 2293.60]  Oh, man.
[2293.80 --> 2295.66]  We could jump and see if there's any new Twitter questions.
[2295.84 --> 2296.84]  Yeah, we can jump in,
[2296.84 --> 2298.76]  see if there's any new Twitter questions for the moment.
[2298.94 --> 2301.36]  So let's go ahead and head over there.
[2302.16 --> 2302.96]  Here we go.
[2303.76 --> 2304.08]  All right.
[2304.12 --> 2305.58]  Hopefully you guys are starting to hit us
[2305.58 --> 2308.22]  with some of the questions for George here.
[2309.36 --> 2309.94]  All right.
[2310.02 --> 2310.50]  There we go.
[2310.74 --> 2310.96]  All right.
[2310.98 --> 2311.24]  We're back.
[2311.24 --> 2311.62]  All right.
[2311.68 --> 2312.46]  George is back.
[2312.54 --> 2312.72]  Okay.
[2312.80 --> 2315.16]  We should be stable now on the audio side.
[2315.28 --> 2316.50]  So tell us again,
[2316.62 --> 2318.64]  what makes Corsair different from other companies?
[2322.66 --> 2326.70]  I think the main deal is that we're by engineers for the most part.
[2326.84 --> 2329.36]  Our company has a bunch of engineers at the management level,
[2329.46 --> 2330.66]  director level, and all those guys.
[2331.12 --> 2332.48]  So if something has to be done,
[2332.54 --> 2336.16]  it has to be done like in a way that we make sure it actually has a performance difference
[2336.16 --> 2339.64]  instead of just kind of marketing a performance difference.
[2339.80 --> 2339.94]  Right.
[2343.24 --> 2344.18]  Was that the whole thing?
[2344.24 --> 2345.06]  Is that it in a nutshell?
[2345.06 --> 2345.14]  No.
[2347.08 --> 2348.44]  That's the biggest difference.
[2348.56 --> 2348.68]  I mean,
[2348.74 --> 2350.76]  if you go by engineers,
[2350.84 --> 2351.88]  they have engineering groups,
[2352.02 --> 2353.36]  but you go to the director,
[2353.48 --> 2356.02]  and he's like a marketing guy or an advertising guy or something like that.
[2357.34 --> 2357.68]  Right.
[2357.72 --> 2357.94]  Okay.
[2358.56 --> 2359.52]  It's actually a really good point
[2359.52 --> 2360.86]  because a lot of companies don't.
[2361.22 --> 2363.26]  There seems to be that obvious disconnect.
[2363.98 --> 2365.14]  They don't really get it.
[2365.14 --> 2365.74]  Yeah.
[2365.82 --> 2365.94]  Well,
[2365.98 --> 2367.08]  you see products released,
[2367.18 --> 2367.62]  and you kind of go,
[2367.72 --> 2370.82]  did anyone actually build an enthusiast-grade computer in this case?
[2370.90 --> 2371.14]  Yeah.
[2371.42 --> 2372.46]  And with Corsair,
[2372.62 --> 2375.30]  I think they usually prove that they did
[2375.30 --> 2377.14]  because the marketing materials usually contain
[2377.74 --> 2380.48]  a finished high-end build actually built in the thing.
[2380.54 --> 2380.72]  It's like,
[2380.78 --> 2380.90]  look,
[2380.98 --> 2381.06]  no,
[2381.12 --> 2383.06]  we actually did validate this.
[2385.04 --> 2385.44]  Yeah.
[2385.46 --> 2386.60]  There's a couple of our competitors
[2386.60 --> 2388.74]  that have enthusiasts on board too.
[2388.88 --> 2389.02]  Like,
[2389.12 --> 2389.34]  you know,
[2389.36 --> 2391.12]  we have a bunch of enthusiasts in-house,
[2391.12 --> 2391.36]  and,
[2391.50 --> 2391.74]  you know,
[2391.76 --> 2392.04]  myself,
[2392.20 --> 2393.76]  I build my own systems and do that stuff,
[2393.76 --> 2394.96]  and then some other guys here too.
[2395.46 --> 2397.52]  But a lot of our competitors,
[2397.78 --> 2399.12]  they don't really have that.
[2399.18 --> 2399.80]  So you can see,
[2400.18 --> 2400.56]  for example,
[2400.68 --> 2401.14]  I'll give,
[2401.22 --> 2401.56]  like,
[2401.62 --> 2403.60]  Rob at NZXT and those guys,
[2403.64 --> 2404.24]  those are enthusiasts.
[2404.40 --> 2406.28]  Those guys know the enthusiast-level stuff.
[2406.46 --> 2407.82]  I don't know what the management's like
[2407.82 --> 2408.54]  or anything like that,
[2408.58 --> 2410.32]  but they definitely have enthusiasts on board.
[2410.72 --> 2412.00]  But if you look at some of our other competitors,
[2412.10 --> 2412.56]  when you see,
[2412.66 --> 2412.90]  you know,
[2412.92 --> 2414.10]  the kind of decisions they make
[2414.10 --> 2415.22]  and where they put,
[2415.26 --> 2415.46]  like,
[2415.52 --> 2416.02]  screw holes
[2416.02 --> 2418.80]  and where they put a really bad door on a case
[2418.80 --> 2419.54]  or something like that,
[2419.68 --> 2421.96]  you just know this person's never actually going to use that,
[2422.06 --> 2423.14]  and so they never really thought about
[2423.14 --> 2424.38]  what the usage would look like.
[2425.28 --> 2425.68]  Right.
[2426.70 --> 2430.10]  So I want to launch into one of our non-Corsair topics here.
[2430.92 --> 2432.26]  We shared the doc with you.
[2432.30 --> 2434.06]  Hopefully you had a chance to look at this.
[2434.14 --> 2437.22]  But there is a fantastic editorial piece
[2437.22 --> 2438.82]  on PC Perspective.
[2439.10 --> 2439.96]  So I'm just going to go ahead
[2439.96 --> 2441.20]  and show this to the viewers.
[2441.88 --> 2444.50]  Next-gen graphics and process migration,
[2444.50 --> 2446.72]  20 nanometers and beyond.
[2447.04 --> 2447.22]  So,
[2447.58 --> 2447.96]  George,
[2448.10 --> 2450.92]  what was your first performance-grade graphics card?
[2450.92 --> 2453.06]  I bought,
[2453.46 --> 2454.28]  so my first,
[2454.40 --> 2456.22]  my first PC that I ever bought
[2456.22 --> 2459.68]  had a S3 Verge 2MB card in it,
[2459.74 --> 2460.40]  which was terrible.
[2460.84 --> 2463.20]  This is like 1995 or 1996.
[2463.68 --> 2465.58]  But the first performance-grade card I bought
[2465.58 --> 2468.14]  was probably a Voodoo,
[2468.34 --> 2469.52]  3DFX Voodoo card
[2469.52 --> 2471.22]  that had 4 megs,
[2471.28 --> 2471.94]  and it was like a,
[2472.00 --> 2473.12]  it had a card that you had to,
[2473.20 --> 2475.30]  you had to use a TD card,
[2475.40 --> 2476.66]  and then that was the 3D card.
[2476.92 --> 2478.96]  And so that was my first performance 3D card.
[2478.96 --> 2480.84]  And I was playing like the original Tomb Raider
[2480.84 --> 2481.74]  and GL Quake
[2481.74 --> 2483.32]  and MechWarrior 2
[2483.32 --> 2484.04]  and stuff on that.
[2484.94 --> 2485.40]  Awesome.
[2485.56 --> 2485.82]  Okay,
[2485.92 --> 2487.68]  so you are exactly
[2487.68 --> 2489.16]  the kind of person
[2489.16 --> 2491.00]  that this article is geared towards.
[2491.20 --> 2492.66]  It's a fantastic article,
[2493.34 --> 2494.72]  and basically what it does
[2494.72 --> 2496.08]  is it goes through the history
[2496.08 --> 2496.94]  of what we've seen.
[2497.04 --> 2499.04]  So they've got some pretty iconic cards
[2499.04 --> 2500.10]  that they're showing off
[2500.10 --> 2502.36]  here in the written section of the article.
[2502.36 --> 2504.36]  And it basically talks about
[2504.36 --> 2507.86]  the way that process node migrations
[2507.86 --> 2509.66]  have gone for the last,
[2509.76 --> 2509.98]  well,
[2510.82 --> 2513.06]  really for the last almost 20 years
[2513.06 --> 2515.14]  to the point where graphics performance
[2515.14 --> 2517.64]  has been outstripping
[2517.64 --> 2520.30]  the traditional Moore's law
[2520.30 --> 2521.64]  because not only
[2521.64 --> 2523.64]  are they able to pack in more transistors,
[2523.76 --> 2524.40]  they've been making
[2524.40 --> 2526.46]  much more efficient use of them
[2526.46 --> 2528.00]  as time's gone by.
[2528.00 --> 2530.12]  And what's happening right now,
[2530.18 --> 2531.04]  and I think what enthusiasts
[2531.04 --> 2532.26]  are getting upset about,
[2532.66 --> 2535.78]  is it's just not that easy anymore
[2535.78 --> 2538.32]  to keep driving graphics performance up.
[2538.80 --> 2539.64]  So what's,
[2539.92 --> 2540.28]  I mean,
[2540.38 --> 2540.60]  okay,
[2540.70 --> 2541.74]  so you saw that
[2541.74 --> 2543.86]  both NVIDIA and AMD's
[2543.86 --> 2545.02]  most recent launches
[2545.02 --> 2546.00]  were rebrands,
[2547.28 --> 2547.82]  effectively.
[2548.34 --> 2550.38]  What's your take on that?
[2550.56 --> 2552.40]  Has it just gotten too difficult
[2552.40 --> 2554.28]  to keep pushing performance forward
[2554.28 --> 2555.14]  at the rate that people
[2555.14 --> 2556.82]  have honestly been spoiled by?
[2556.82 --> 2557.70]  Have you felt spoiled?
[2558.00 --> 2561.06]  I think that honestly
[2561.06 --> 2562.58]  what's happened is
[2562.58 --> 2563.80]  that they can push performance
[2563.80 --> 2564.26]  a little bit,
[2564.36 --> 2565.44]  but the software's not able
[2565.44 --> 2566.42]  to keep up with the hardware.
[2566.66 --> 2567.76]  So I think you'll see
[2567.76 --> 2568.42]  a couple of things
[2568.42 --> 2569.40]  over the next little bit.
[2569.48 --> 2570.38]  I think you're going to see
[2570.38 --> 2572.54]  as 4K becomes much more popular,
[2572.66 --> 2573.04]  some of these guys
[2573.04 --> 2574.16]  are talking about 4K monitors
[2574.16 --> 2575.58]  and stuff in the near future,
[2576.06 --> 2578.28]  more 4K stuff
[2578.28 --> 2579.32]  that pushes video cards
[2579.32 --> 2580.38]  to their limits,
[2580.44 --> 2581.22]  and that's going to make
[2581.22 --> 2582.68]  video cards a really big deal.
[2583.10 --> 2584.38]  Right now at 1080p,
[2584.56 --> 2584.72]  I mean,
[2584.72 --> 2585.54]  that's the kind of standard
[2585.54 --> 2586.56]  your TV runs on,
[2586.88 --> 2587.98]  and cell phones are running
[2587.98 --> 2588.50]  on that now.
[2588.84 --> 2589.60]  So I think you see
[2589.60 --> 2590.26]  a lot more people
[2590.26 --> 2591.10]  are running that easily,
[2591.26 --> 2592.46]  but 4K is going to be
[2592.46 --> 2593.36]  a real big stressor.
[2593.78 --> 2594.72]  But I do think
[2594.72 --> 2595.46]  that it's going to be interesting
[2595.46 --> 2596.42]  to see if they can keep
[2596.42 --> 2597.12]  that pace up.
[2597.18 --> 2597.98]  I don't think it's really...
[2598.70 --> 2599.20]  At some point,
[2599.24 --> 2600.66]  you can't make that,
[2600.66 --> 2601.88]  you know,
[2602.18 --> 2604.04]  process of shrinkage
[2604.04 --> 2604.66]  any better.
[2604.66 --> 2605.90]  20 nanometers,
[2605.90 --> 2605.92]  20 nanometers,
[2606.06 --> 2606.48]  16,
[2606.68 --> 2607.08]  14,
[2607.24 --> 2607.54]  12,
[2607.54 --> 2607.84]  whatever,
[2608.00 --> 2608.34]  you're not going
[2608.34 --> 2609.02]  to get that much better.
[2610.54 --> 2612.26]  So tell me this.
[2613.00 --> 2613.74]  Do you feel like
[2613.74 --> 2615.02]  not only on the CPU,
[2615.16 --> 2615.92]  GPU side,
[2616.36 --> 2617.48]  people have been
[2617.48 --> 2618.56]  a little bit spoiled
[2618.56 --> 2620.44]  similarly in other categories?
[2620.68 --> 2620.94]  I mean,
[2621.04 --> 2622.18]  when you're working
[2622.18 --> 2623.42]  on a new case,
[2623.74 --> 2623.96]  I mean,
[2624.04 --> 2625.90]  what are the overall goals?
[2626.16 --> 2626.38]  Okay,
[2626.40 --> 2627.52]  you have to build it cheaper,
[2627.94 --> 2629.10]  you have to sell more,
[2629.28 --> 2630.82]  it has to have more features,
[2631.18 --> 2632.76]  and we want to see
[2632.76 --> 2634.48]  some amazing innovations.
[2635.10 --> 2636.02]  And it has to look great.
[2637.10 --> 2637.34]  Yeah,
[2637.44 --> 2637.98]  I think that,
[2638.28 --> 2639.04]  so when we launched
[2639.04 --> 2639.64]  the 800D,
[2639.76 --> 2639.96]  you know,
[2640.02 --> 2641.42]  we put some rubber grommet
[2641.42 --> 2642.44]  cable routing holes in it,
[2642.66 --> 2642.94]  and, you know,
[2642.98 --> 2643.80]  hot-swell power drives,
[2643.90 --> 2644.70]  and a push-button
[2644.70 --> 2645.38]  side panel release,
[2645.42 --> 2646.08]  and suddenly everyone
[2646.08 --> 2646.44]  was like,
[2646.50 --> 2646.98]  oh my God,
[2647.20 --> 2647.40]  you know,
[2647.42 --> 2648.20]  what have you guys done?
[2648.26 --> 2649.46]  And the world changed.
[2649.78 --> 2650.20]  But now,
[2650.26 --> 2650.42]  like,
[2650.44 --> 2651.56]  you go buy a $40 case
[2651.56 --> 2651.96]  and it has, like,
[2651.98 --> 2652.64]  rubber grommet cable
[2652.64 --> 2653.12]  routing holes
[2653.12 --> 2653.84]  and stuff like that.
[2653.92 --> 2654.12]  So,
[2654.48 --> 2654.84]  you're right,
[2654.94 --> 2656.32]  the standardized stuff
[2656.32 --> 2657.34]  has changed quite a bit.
[2658.14 --> 2658.70]  People are,
[2658.70 --> 2659.70]  kind of been spoiled.
[2659.80 --> 2660.62]  You're just used to that
[2660.62 --> 2661.66]  your hard drive won't require
[2661.66 --> 2662.74]  you to screw anything in,
[2663.16 --> 2664.64]  and all that stuff is new.
[2664.76 --> 2664.96]  I mean,
[2664.96 --> 2665.84]  it's relatively new.
[2666.58 --> 2666.90]  So,
[2667.06 --> 2667.38]  I mean,
[2667.54 --> 2668.62]  now you have to come up
[2668.62 --> 2669.12]  with something like
[2669.12 --> 2669.80]  the Air 540,
[2669.90 --> 2670.30]  where it's like,
[2670.34 --> 2670.44]  hey,
[2670.50 --> 2670.60]  we,
[2670.74 --> 2671.06]  you know,
[2671.16 --> 2672.18]  changed the form factor
[2672.18 --> 2672.66]  a little bit
[2672.66 --> 2674.46]  and formatted it
[2674.46 --> 2675.76]  specifically for this purpose.
[2676.28 --> 2677.28]  And people are responding
[2677.28 --> 2677.74]  well to that.
[2677.84 --> 2678.18]  They're saying,
[2678.28 --> 2678.44]  okay,
[2678.88 --> 2679.18]  you know,
[2679.30 --> 2680.68]  how many cases can you launch
[2680.68 --> 2681.66]  where the hard drive cage
[2681.66 --> 2682.44]  is in the same place
[2682.44 --> 2683.28]  and the optical drive cage
[2683.28 --> 2684.08]  is in the same place
[2684.08 --> 2685.16]  and the motherboard's
[2685.16 --> 2685.80]  the same size,
[2685.86 --> 2686.14]  and okay,
[2686.24 --> 2687.22]  so this one has seven slots
[2687.22 --> 2687.76]  instead of six,
[2687.76 --> 2688.52]  but I don't really care,
[2688.64 --> 2688.90]  you know?
[2689.48 --> 2689.76]  So,
[2690.18 --> 2690.76]  I think you do,
[2690.84 --> 2691.10]  you're right,
[2691.14 --> 2691.84]  you do have to come up
[2691.84 --> 2692.38]  with something new
[2692.38 --> 2692.80]  and innovative,
[2692.88 --> 2693.50]  and it's getting more
[2693.50 --> 2694.20]  and more challenging.
[2694.38 --> 2694.82]  But luckily,
[2694.82 --> 2695.88]  with mechanical stuff,
[2696.02 --> 2696.66]  you can do that
[2696.66 --> 2697.78]  much easier than you can
[2697.78 --> 2698.18]  with like,
[2698.52 --> 2699.78]  actually shrinking the,
[2699.78 --> 2701.32]  you know,
[2701.60 --> 2702.44]  manufacturing process
[2702.44 --> 2703.38]  of a GPU die.
[2705.00 --> 2705.44]  So,
[2705.80 --> 2707.46]  metal costs.
[2707.72 --> 2708.78]  How do you guys deal
[2708.78 --> 2709.98]  with the fact that
[2709.98 --> 2712.06]  metal inherently costs
[2712.06 --> 2713.24]  more over time?
[2713.76 --> 2714.88]  And unlike,
[2715.16 --> 2715.38]  you know,
[2715.42 --> 2716.68]  the traditional PC
[2716.68 --> 2717.88]  component expectation
[2717.88 --> 2719.60]  where pricing should just
[2719.60 --> 2721.38]  always be in free fall,
[2721.50 --> 2722.30]  whether it's hard drives
[2722.30 --> 2723.10]  or CPUs,
[2723.14 --> 2723.60]  where again,
[2723.68 --> 2725.60]  it's this spoiled mentality
[2725.60 --> 2726.76]  of the PC customer.
[2727.26 --> 2728.52]  How do you guys deal
[2728.52 --> 2729.00]  with that?
[2730.14 --> 2730.52]  Well,
[2730.56 --> 2730.96]  it's actually,
[2731.22 --> 2732.00]  so that's not really,
[2732.28 --> 2733.44]  I haven't seen that too much.
[2733.52 --> 2734.28]  I think what you see
[2734.28 --> 2735.52]  is that when people
[2735.52 --> 2736.62]  want to buy a new product,
[2736.86 --> 2738.98]  they decide what their budget is
[2738.98 --> 2739.80]  or, you know,
[2739.86 --> 2740.84]  what features they really want
[2740.84 --> 2741.30]  and then they go out
[2741.30 --> 2741.80]  and look for it.
[2741.80 --> 2741.92]  So,
[2742.00 --> 2743.08]  for a graphics card guys,
[2743.64 --> 2744.32]  you see a lot of people
[2744.32 --> 2744.64]  that say,
[2744.72 --> 2744.80]  hey,
[2744.84 --> 2745.02]  you know,
[2745.08 --> 2745.26]  two,
[2745.36 --> 2745.86]  three hundred bucks,
[2745.92 --> 2746.32]  that's what I'm going
[2746.32 --> 2747.30]  to spend on a graphics card.
[2747.42 --> 2747.96]  I'm just not going
[2747.96 --> 2748.82]  to spend that much more
[2748.82 --> 2749.74]  and anything less than
[2749.74 --> 2750.14]  that I'm not going
[2750.14 --> 2750.94]  to be satisfied with.
[2751.36 --> 2752.44]  And whether they spend
[2752.44 --> 2752.62]  two,
[2752.68 --> 2753.50]  three hundred bucks this year
[2753.50 --> 2754.30]  or in two years,
[2754.30 --> 2755.26]  that's kind of their budget.
[2755.68 --> 2756.18]  I think cases,
[2756.30 --> 2757.18]  you get kind of that same thing.
[2757.26 --> 2758.12]  A guy wants to spend
[2758.12 --> 2759.00]  X amount of dollars
[2759.00 --> 2759.54]  on a case
[2759.54 --> 2760.04]  and he goes out
[2760.04 --> 2760.52]  and looks around
[2760.52 --> 2760.90]  and says,
[2761.04 --> 2762.18]  this is the one I like best
[2762.18 --> 2762.94]  for that price point.
[2763.36 --> 2763.88]  And you can maybe
[2763.88 --> 2764.56]  talk him up
[2764.56 --> 2765.54]  or he can be talked down
[2765.54 --> 2766.58]  depending on the feature set.
[2766.72 --> 2767.84]  But I don't think
[2767.84 --> 2768.68]  they really care too much
[2768.68 --> 2770.84]  that the case cost,
[2770.94 --> 2771.18]  you know,
[2771.26 --> 2772.68]  $159 last year
[2772.68 --> 2773.84]  still cost $159
[2773.84 --> 2774.76]  because it's not like
[2774.76 --> 2775.46]  the metal got cheaper.
[2776.22 --> 2776.54]  So,
[2776.86 --> 2777.28]  why do you,
[2777.40 --> 2777.98]  why have you guys
[2777.98 --> 2779.74]  not done an ITX case yet?
[2784.24 --> 2784.58]  Wait,
[2784.66 --> 2785.42]  there's ITX now?
[2785.64 --> 2785.76]  No,
[2785.78 --> 2786.06]  I'm just kidding.
[2786.68 --> 2787.02]  Yeah,
[2787.12 --> 2789.44]  there's stuff in the roadmap.
[2789.64 --> 2790.64]  There's stuff being worked on.
[2792.04 --> 2792.26]  Ah,
[2792.34 --> 2792.60]  okay.
[2792.60 --> 2792.92]  So,
[2792.96 --> 2793.58]  you're not going to tell us
[2793.58 --> 2794.14]  any more than that.
[2794.16 --> 2794.90]  I thought we were friends.
[2798.62 --> 2799.28]  I'll tell you what,
[2799.30 --> 2800.36]  you can come to CES
[2800.36 --> 2801.60]  and we can shoot another video
[2801.60 --> 2802.68]  like you did with 900D
[2802.68 --> 2804.00]  and we'll talk about it then.
[2804.14 --> 2804.62]  All right.
[2804.76 --> 2805.12]  Hey,
[2805.64 --> 2806.78]  that's that.
[2806.78 --> 2806.94]  That.
[2807.40 --> 2807.56]  Now,
[2807.70 --> 2807.88]  see,
[2808.04 --> 2809.04]  now I feel like
[2809.04 --> 2810.94]  we're getting friendly here.
[2811.00 --> 2811.92]  We're having some fun.
[2812.04 --> 2812.26]  All right.
[2812.34 --> 2812.76]  Because,
[2813.14 --> 2813.48]  I mean,
[2813.58 --> 2815.02]  Corsair is synonymous
[2815.02 --> 2816.58]  with performance PCs
[2816.58 --> 2818.50]  and I think that
[2818.50 --> 2819.36]  performance PCs
[2819.36 --> 2821.04]  have really come to ITX
[2821.04 --> 2822.22]  in a way that they hadn't.
[2822.22 --> 2824.20]  up until the last year or so
[2824.20 --> 2826.04]  and so I'm excited
[2826.04 --> 2827.28]  to speculate
[2827.28 --> 2828.46]  that there will potentially
[2828.46 --> 2829.72]  be some alleged
[2829.72 --> 2831.84]  thing to talk about
[2831.84 --> 2832.84]  at CES this year.
[2835.22 --> 2835.68]  Alleged,
[2835.74 --> 2835.90]  yeah.
[2835.90 --> 2836.60]  like,
[2836.70 --> 2838.54]  the answer really is
[2838.54 --> 2838.90]  is that
[2838.90 --> 2839.68]  mini-ITX,
[2839.76 --> 2840.26]  like you said,
[2840.40 --> 2841.84]  had been kind of boring
[2841.84 --> 2842.96]  for the past few years
[2842.96 --> 2844.40]  until Intel
[2844.40 --> 2845.58]  kind of put everything
[2845.58 --> 2846.86]  on the CPU die itself
[2846.86 --> 2847.72]  so that your memory
[2847.72 --> 2848.52]  controller is gone
[2848.52 --> 2849.54]  and your, like,
[2849.62 --> 2850.34]  Southbridge is almost
[2850.34 --> 2850.88]  gone completely
[2850.88 --> 2851.78]  like USB and all that
[2851.78 --> 2852.56]  SATA stuff rather
[2852.56 --> 2853.24]  is going to be all
[2853.24 --> 2854.06]  CPU integrated.
[2854.46 --> 2855.14]  So now motherboards
[2855.14 --> 2855.92]  can be really,
[2856.02 --> 2856.44]  really small
[2856.44 --> 2856.84]  because they don't
[2856.84 --> 2857.28]  have to make,
[2857.44 --> 2858.04]  you know,
[2858.20 --> 2859.28]  a footprint for all
[2859.28 --> 2859.98]  the different components.
[2860.48 --> 2861.42]  So for the first time,
[2861.48 --> 2862.30]  mini-ITX motherboards
[2862.30 --> 2863.44]  have really good performance
[2863.44 --> 2864.54]  in the past year or two
[2864.54 --> 2865.64]  and so now we're seeing
[2865.64 --> 2866.54]  a lot more mini-ITX
[2866.54 --> 2867.26]  performance builds.
[2867.40 --> 2868.18]  Before it was just kind of,
[2868.24 --> 2869.24]  you want mini-ITX,
[2869.54 --> 2870.22]  you might as well just buy
[2870.22 --> 2870.92]  like a Mac mini
[2870.92 --> 2871.80]  or one of those
[2871.80 --> 2874.50]  Aopen little micro PC things
[2874.50 --> 2875.24]  and that was it.
[2875.40 --> 2875.52]  Yeah,
[2875.56 --> 2876.10]  or there'd be like
[2876.10 --> 2877.04]  one board option
[2877.04 --> 2878.44]  that isn't an Intel
[2878.44 --> 2879.56]  server board
[2879.56 --> 2880.90]  or something like that,
[2880.98 --> 2881.16]  you know,
[2881.22 --> 2881.50]  or like...
[2881.50 --> 2881.68]  Yeah,
[2881.72 --> 2882.12]  you'd go out
[2882.12 --> 2883.24]  and like Zotac,
[2883.78 --> 2884.90]  Zotac was really good at that.
[2884.98 --> 2885.58]  They did a bunch of
[2885.58 --> 2886.22]  really cool small
[2886.22 --> 2886.98]  form factor boards.
[2887.30 --> 2887.56]  Yes,
[2888.14 --> 2888.84]  and they basically
[2888.84 --> 2889.60]  made it cool
[2889.60 --> 2890.44]  so that ASUS
[2890.44 --> 2891.58]  could swoop in
[2891.58 --> 2892.76]  and completely take
[2892.76 --> 2893.54]  all the market share
[2893.54 --> 2894.02]  away from them
[2894.02 --> 2894.88]  as far as I could tell.
[2895.90 --> 2896.00]  Yeah,
[2896.04 --> 2896.64]  that's what ASUS
[2896.64 --> 2897.30]  does really well.
[2897.44 --> 2897.52]  Like,
[2897.56 --> 2897.66]  hey,
[2897.70 --> 2898.52]  someone did something cool,
[2898.62 --> 2899.58]  let's do that way better
[2899.58 --> 2901.08]  and just jump in
[2901.08 --> 2902.34]  and launch 10 versions of it.
[2903.94 --> 2904.34]  Yeah,
[2904.52 --> 2904.78]  yeah,
[2904.86 --> 2906.46]  they really are good
[2906.46 --> 2906.74]  at that,
[2906.80 --> 2907.08]  aren't they?
[2908.16 --> 2908.44]  Yep.
[2909.34 --> 2910.58]  So between Corsair
[2910.58 --> 2911.10]  and ASUS,
[2911.22 --> 2912.32]  is there really any other,
[2912.58 --> 2912.90]  you know,
[2912.96 --> 2914.40]  and then AMD or Intel
[2914.40 --> 2915.34]  and NVIDIA
[2915.34 --> 2916.26]  or AMD again,
[2916.32 --> 2917.44]  is there really anything else
[2917.44 --> 2918.50]  that you feel like you need
[2918.50 --> 2920.10]  for an awesome PC these days?
[2922.76 --> 2923.16]  Well,
[2923.28 --> 2923.96]  it depends on what kind
[2923.96 --> 2924.62]  of beer you like.
[2925.82 --> 2927.22]  That's my personal preference.
[2928.52 --> 2928.92]  Actually,
[2929.00 --> 2931.42]  I use a lot of different stuff,
[2931.60 --> 2932.84]  but so for gaming headsets,
[2932.90 --> 2934.00]  when I'm playing a game,
[2934.06 --> 2935.90]  I use like a V2000,
[2936.26 --> 2941.58]  but for when I'm talking
[2941.58 --> 2942.78]  and like listening to music,
[2942.78 --> 2944.12]  I actually use high-end headphones.
[2944.88 --> 2946.04]  So I'm still playing in that game.
[2946.04 --> 2946.92]  Like I have a nice set
[2946.92 --> 2947.58]  of buyer dynamics
[2947.58 --> 2948.58]  that I use for music,
[2948.58 --> 2949.66]  but when I play games
[2949.66 --> 2950.48]  and stuff and I want the mic,
[2950.52 --> 2952.32]  I just put on my 2000s,
[2952.36 --> 2953.26]  Ventus 2000s.
[2953.68 --> 2953.90]  Cool.
[2954.26 --> 2955.60]  How much would you love Corsair
[2955.60 --> 2958.44]  to get into true audiophile
[2958.44 --> 2959.60]  grade headphones
[2959.60 --> 2961.20]  as opposed to gaming headphones?
[2962.54 --> 2964.70]  I would be really excited
[2964.70 --> 2965.20]  about that,
[2965.62 --> 2966.64]  but the trick is
[2966.64 --> 2967.44]  it's a tough market.
[2967.64 --> 2967.76]  You know,
[2967.82 --> 2969.48]  there's a lot of leverage
[2969.48 --> 2970.40]  to the old brands.
[2970.62 --> 2971.64]  Like you can't like exactly
[2971.64 --> 2973.62]  launch a new quality brand easily.
[2974.02 --> 2974.84]  It takes a lot of time
[2974.84 --> 2975.64]  to get people to realize
[2975.64 --> 2976.46]  that you're not just trying
[2976.46 --> 2977.62]  to rip off beats
[2977.62 --> 2978.46]  or somebody like that.
[2980.66 --> 2981.34]  Fair enough.
[2981.82 --> 2982.20]  All right.
[2982.32 --> 2983.70]  So next topic.
[2983.88 --> 2987.32]  This one has made some waves
[2987.32 --> 2988.66]  over the last little bit here.
[2988.76 --> 2989.36]  So this was posted
[2989.36 --> 2989.86]  on the forum
[2989.86 --> 2990.94]  by TopWarGamer
[2990.94 --> 2992.38]  and there's a quote here.
[2992.52 --> 2993.64]  Call of Duty developer
[2993.64 --> 2994.56]  Infinity Ward
[2994.56 --> 2995.38]  has suggested
[2995.38 --> 2996.12]  that the people
[2996.12 --> 2996.88]  most engaged
[2996.88 --> 2997.74]  with the franchise
[2997.74 --> 3000.14]  aren't really gamers at all
[3000.14 --> 3000.94]  as they don't play
[3000.94 --> 3001.50]  any titles
[3001.50 --> 3002.26]  that aren't affiliated
[3002.26 --> 3003.52]  with the series.
[3003.52 --> 3004.56]  That's according
[3004.56 --> 3005.94]  to executive producer
[3005.94 --> 3006.86]  Mark Rubin
[3006.86 --> 3008.78]  who told OXM
[3008.78 --> 3009.76]  that he didn't expect
[3009.76 --> 3010.90]  the imminent arrival
[3010.90 --> 3011.94]  of the next-gen consoles
[3011.94 --> 3013.52]  to have much of an impact
[3013.52 --> 3014.20]  on the makeup
[3014.20 --> 3016.04]  of COD's audience.
[3017.30 --> 3018.62]  So the original article
[3018.62 --> 3020.24]  was from IGN
[3020.24 --> 3023.40]  and I'll just pull this up here.
[3025.00 --> 3026.60]  There's a very angry threat
[3026.60 --> 3027.16]  on our forum
[3027.16 --> 3027.82]  but I want to hear
[3027.82 --> 3029.26]  your initial reaction.
[3029.26 --> 3030.78]  Is someone who plays
[3030.78 --> 3031.70]  a game
[3031.70 --> 3033.06]  as opposed to
[3033.06 --> 3033.78]  lots of games
[3033.78 --> 3034.28]  a gamer?
[3038.02 --> 3038.86]  That's a tough one.
[3038.92 --> 3039.58]  That depends on
[3039.58 --> 3040.86]  would they call themselves
[3040.86 --> 3041.16]  a gamer
[3041.16 --> 3042.38]  or would we call them gamers?
[3042.52 --> 3042.94]  I think you get
[3042.94 --> 3043.64]  a little bit of that.
[3044.30 --> 3045.84]  So I don't want to come across
[3045.84 --> 3046.36]  like hey
[3046.36 --> 3047.58]  all the cool guys
[3047.58 --> 3048.68]  are playing
[3048.68 --> 3050.44]  Quake back in the day
[3050.44 --> 3051.72]  and all that stuff.
[3051.82 --> 3052.40]  I mean there are guys
[3052.40 --> 3053.30]  who didn't get into gaming
[3053.30 --> 3054.00]  because they weren't
[3054.00 --> 3054.48]  old enough
[3054.48 --> 3055.68]  to be into those kinds of games.
[3056.28 --> 3056.68]  But yeah
[3056.68 --> 3057.90]  I would say that
[3057.90 --> 3059.52]  he's probably got a point
[3059.52 --> 3060.18]  and what I think
[3060.18 --> 3060.62]  he might have been
[3060.62 --> 3061.02]  trying to say
[3061.02 --> 3061.68]  is that your average
[3061.68 --> 3062.42]  Call of Duty gamer
[3062.42 --> 3063.78]  isn't like a hardcore gamer
[3063.78 --> 3064.52]  who plays like
[3064.52 --> 3065.58]  you know 10 titles a year.
[3065.92 --> 3066.58]  He may just play
[3066.58 --> 3067.20]  like one or two
[3067.20 --> 3067.96]  Call of Duty titles.
[3068.58 --> 3069.26]  But you know
[3069.26 --> 3070.98]  when I was really gaming
[3070.98 --> 3071.66]  I have kids now
[3071.66 --> 3072.42]  so I don't game as much
[3072.42 --> 3073.50]  but when I was really gaming
[3073.50 --> 3074.02]  a lot you know
[3074.02 --> 3074.96]  every month or something
[3074.96 --> 3076.12]  I would find some new game
[3076.12 --> 3076.98]  to play and beat through
[3076.98 --> 3078.16]  and then go back
[3078.16 --> 3078.80]  to Counter-Strike
[3078.80 --> 3079.76]  and wait for the next one.
[3081.14 --> 3081.54]  Yeah.
[3081.84 --> 3082.60]  Yeah that's pretty much.
[3082.60 --> 3083.24]  Yeah that sounds like
[3083.24 --> 3084.12]  what a lot of people did.
[3084.24 --> 3084.60]  However
[3084.60 --> 3086.84]  I am going to throw this out there
[3086.84 --> 3089.92]  is a professional hockey player
[3089.92 --> 3091.26]  who lives, breathes
[3091.26 --> 3093.90]  and eats nothing but hockey
[3093.90 --> 3095.78]  an athlete.
[3096.02 --> 3096.14]  Yeah.
[3096.78 --> 3097.10]  You know
[3097.10 --> 3098.76]  like how do we define
[3098.76 --> 3099.76]  the term gamer
[3099.76 --> 3102.34]  if not someone who plays games?
[3102.56 --> 3103.60]  And then that leads into
[3103.60 --> 3104.52]  that whole other debate.
[3104.64 --> 3104.94]  So I mean
[3104.94 --> 3106.32]  you're an old school gamer guy.
[3106.76 --> 3108.26]  Is someone who plays
[3108.26 --> 3109.84]  like I've been playing this game
[3109.84 --> 3111.66]  on my Nvidia Shield.
[3112.12 --> 3112.74]  It's called
[3112.74 --> 3113.20]  I don't know
[3113.20 --> 3114.48]  it's some stupid game
[3114.48 --> 3115.30]  on the Shield store
[3115.30 --> 3116.56]  where you're like this swordsman
[3116.56 --> 3117.36]  and you jump around
[3117.36 --> 3118.82]  and like hack at stuff
[3118.82 --> 3120.30]  and it's a super casual game.
[3120.70 --> 3121.78]  Am I still a gamer
[3121.78 --> 3122.68]  if I don't play any
[3122.68 --> 3123.10]  you know
[3123.10 --> 3124.38]  real hardcore games anymore?
[3126.02 --> 3126.38]  Yeah.
[3126.62 --> 3127.00]  I think
[3127.00 --> 3128.18]  so I think that that's like
[3128.18 --> 3128.44]  okay
[3128.44 --> 3129.68]  my wife plays Candy Crush
[3129.68 --> 3130.38]  on her phone right
[3130.38 --> 3131.54]  does that make her a gamer?
[3131.94 --> 3132.28]  I mean
[3132.28 --> 3133.56]  you and I might say
[3133.56 --> 3134.38]  no that's ridiculous
[3134.38 --> 3135.44]  that's just a phone game
[3135.44 --> 3136.06]  but I mean
[3136.06 --> 3137.00]  if you look at it
[3137.00 --> 3137.30]  from
[3137.30 --> 3138.50]  with the way that these guys
[3138.50 --> 3138.76]  are saying
[3138.76 --> 3139.90]  hey the gaming market is growing
[3139.90 --> 3140.98]  that's where the gaming market
[3140.98 --> 3141.92]  is really growing quickly
[3141.92 --> 3142.96]  is like Facebook games
[3142.96 --> 3144.24]  and mobile app games
[3144.24 --> 3145.42]  I would say that
[3145.42 --> 3146.04]  if you don't have
[3146.04 --> 3147.32]  like a dedicated graphics card
[3147.32 --> 3147.90]  in your system
[3147.90 --> 3148.78]  you're not a gamer.
[3149.02 --> 3149.96]  Like if you don't
[3149.96 --> 3150.50]  if you've never
[3150.50 --> 3150.96]  you know
[3150.96 --> 3151.50]  if you don't understand
[3151.50 --> 3152.98]  what the WASD cluster is
[3152.98 --> 3153.72]  you're not a gamer.
[3153.82 --> 3154.38]  Like that's my
[3154.38 --> 3155.28]  like snobbish
[3155.28 --> 3156.46]  kind of arrogant attitude
[3156.46 --> 3156.98]  towards it.
[3157.08 --> 3157.26]  Yeah.
[3157.48 --> 3157.70]  But
[3157.70 --> 3158.20]  Yeah.
[3159.32 --> 3160.08]  Sorry keep going.
[3163.74 --> 3164.40]  Yeah that's
[3164.40 --> 3164.86]  I mean
[3164.86 --> 3165.78]  but then being that
[3165.78 --> 3166.26]  to be fair
[3166.26 --> 3166.56]  like
[3166.56 --> 3167.70]  I don't want to scare
[3167.70 --> 3168.80]  new gamers off either.
[3168.92 --> 3169.64]  I don't want to be like
[3169.64 --> 3170.22]  hey you know
[3170.22 --> 3171.20]  we're the cool kids
[3171.20 --> 3172.42]  and you're just a new guy
[3172.42 --> 3173.04]  and get the hell out
[3173.04 --> 3173.94]  of our cool club.
[3174.34 --> 3175.10]  I want people that like
[3175.10 --> 3176.02]  hey maybe if you started
[3176.02 --> 3176.90]  playing Candy Crush Saga
[3176.90 --> 3177.64]  you'd realize like
[3177.64 --> 3178.84]  how cool games can be
[3178.84 --> 3180.40]  and then maybe you'd move up
[3180.40 --> 3181.26]  and play other games
[3181.26 --> 3182.08]  and that's like
[3182.08 --> 3182.90]  what I want people
[3182.90 --> 3183.46]  to feel like
[3183.46 --> 3183.90]  is like hey
[3183.90 --> 3184.74]  let's welcome
[3184.74 --> 3185.50]  the more gamers
[3185.50 --> 3186.40]  that get into this business
[3186.40 --> 3186.90]  and industry
[3186.90 --> 3188.38]  again the more games
[3188.38 --> 3188.92]  that get sold
[3188.92 --> 3190.08]  that's better for everybody
[3190.08 --> 3191.30]  like it's better
[3191.30 --> 3192.66]  because then more gamers
[3192.66 --> 3193.60]  get moved into
[3193.60 --> 3194.44]  buying new stuff
[3194.44 --> 3195.10]  and you guys get
[3195.10 --> 3195.74]  cooler hardware
[3195.74 --> 3196.54]  and cooler mice
[3196.54 --> 3196.94]  and keyboards
[3196.94 --> 3198.14]  and you know
[3198.14 --> 3198.94]  gaming monitors
[3198.94 --> 3200.32]  everything gets better
[3200.32 --> 3201.64]  if there's more people here.
[3203.70 --> 3204.62]  Yeah it's very true
[3204.62 --> 3205.70]  and I think a lot of it
[3205.70 --> 3206.96]  is your personal mindset too
[3206.96 --> 3207.80]  because like
[3207.80 --> 3208.48]  I know friends
[3208.48 --> 3209.58]  that play hockey
[3209.58 --> 3210.78]  that would consider
[3210.78 --> 3211.50]  themselves athletes
[3211.50 --> 3212.22]  and I know friends
[3212.22 --> 3212.80]  that play hockey
[3212.80 --> 3213.54]  that would not
[3213.54 --> 3214.90]  consider themselves athletes
[3214.90 --> 3216.50]  so I think it also depends
[3216.50 --> 3217.38]  like where you're at
[3217.38 --> 3218.22]  like there might be a dude
[3218.22 --> 3219.32]  that plays COD every night
[3219.32 --> 3220.38]  but he only plays it
[3220.38 --> 3222.30]  for 20 minutes before bed
[3222.30 --> 3223.06]  and he doesn't really feel
[3223.06 --> 3223.58]  like a gamer
[3223.58 --> 3224.54]  then there might be someone
[3224.54 --> 3225.56]  who plays COD every night
[3225.56 --> 3226.36]  and only plays it
[3226.36 --> 3227.54]  20 minutes before bed
[3227.54 --> 3229.10]  but is really excited
[3229.10 --> 3230.00]  for that every time
[3230.00 --> 3230.80]  and reads up on all
[3230.80 --> 3231.38]  the new articles
[3231.38 --> 3232.08]  on new games
[3232.08 --> 3233.00]  and is really into it
[3233.00 --> 3233.70]  and considers himself
[3233.70 --> 3234.06]  a gamer.
[3234.22 --> 3234.98]  That's a great point
[3234.98 --> 3237.46]  because I play one sport
[3237.46 --> 3238.70]  I play badminton
[3238.70 --> 3239.44]  that's it
[3239.44 --> 3241.00]  I only play once a week
[3241.00 --> 3242.76]  I would call myself
[3242.76 --> 3243.72]  a badminton player
[3243.72 --> 3244.64]  I wouldn't call myself
[3244.64 --> 3245.08]  an athlete.
[3245.76 --> 3245.96]  Yeah
[3245.96 --> 3247.74]  that's interesting.
[3248.44 --> 3249.18]  Would you call me
[3249.18 --> 3249.54]  an athlete?
[3250.22 --> 3250.54]  No.
[3250.98 --> 3251.16]  Right
[3251.16 --> 3252.94]  but I play competitive
[3252.94 --> 3254.32]  badminton
[3254.32 --> 3255.30]  in a ladder
[3255.30 --> 3256.34]  I play in a competitive
[3256.34 --> 3257.58]  ladder every Sunday night
[3257.58 --> 3260.04]  and I'm pretty decent
[3260.04 --> 3261.10]  but then there's also
[3261.10 --> 3261.98]  some other people
[3261.98 --> 3263.10]  that are probably
[3263.10 --> 3263.74]  a little bit more
[3263.74 --> 3264.56]  hardcore into it
[3264.56 --> 3265.72]  that only play badminton
[3265.72 --> 3266.58]  that would call themselves
[3266.58 --> 3266.84]  an athlete.
[3266.86 --> 3267.12]  Yes.
[3267.84 --> 3269.08]  So I think it depends
[3269.08 --> 3270.40]  a lot on the individual person.
[3271.12 --> 3272.46]  So the question is
[3272.46 --> 3273.28]  I mean really
[3273.28 --> 3273.68]  the guy
[3273.68 --> 3274.86]  the Call of Duty guy
[3274.86 --> 3275.56]  from Infinity Ward
[3275.56 --> 3275.96]  or whatever
[3275.96 --> 3276.86]  that said that
[3276.86 --> 3278.02]  he's just trying to say
[3278.02 --> 3278.32]  that
[3278.32 --> 3279.14]  and what he's trying to say
[3279.14 --> 3280.00]  is Call of Duty players
[3280.00 --> 3280.76]  are Call of Duty players
[3280.76 --> 3281.44]  they're not gamers
[3281.44 --> 3282.42]  and he's trying to brand
[3282.42 --> 3283.58]  them specifically as
[3283.58 --> 3284.96]  guys who love Call of Duty
[3284.96 --> 3286.52]  not guys who love all games
[3286.52 --> 3288.42]  and that's a solid point
[3288.42 --> 3289.14]  there's a lot of dudes
[3289.14 --> 3289.94]  who don't play anything
[3289.94 --> 3290.60]  but Call of Duty.
[3291.34 --> 3292.28]  This is a good perspective
[3292.28 --> 3292.90]  because I think
[3292.90 --> 3294.16]  most of the replies
[3294.16 --> 3294.88]  on our forum
[3294.88 --> 3296.30]  were just very angry
[3296.30 --> 3298.52]  about the implication
[3298.52 --> 3299.40]  that someone who
[3299.40 --> 3300.52]  plays only one game
[3300.52 --> 3301.08]  isn't a gamer
[3301.08 --> 3302.34]  but this is a much more
[3302.34 --> 3304.06]  balanced approach to it
[3304.06 --> 3304.40]  I think.
[3304.94 --> 3306.30]  I do want to move on
[3306.30 --> 3308.02]  because I've got a topic
[3308.02 --> 3308.86]  that I'm sure
[3308.86 --> 3310.18]  you are going to
[3310.18 --> 3311.96]  love to talk about
[3311.96 --> 3313.20]  I don't know
[3313.20 --> 3314.02]  if you saw this one
[3314.02 --> 3315.38]  I added it at the last minute
[3315.38 --> 3316.92]  but this is a blog
[3316.92 --> 3318.58]  on the post
[3318.58 --> 3319.10]  on the one
[3319.10 --> 3319.46]  and only
[3319.46 --> 3320.88]  Corsair.com
[3320.88 --> 3322.56]  Battlefield 4
[3322.56 --> 3324.44]  loves high speed memory
[3324.44 --> 3325.06]  and was this
[3325.06 --> 3326.14]  was this a guest article
[3326.14 --> 3326.92]  that you guys had
[3326.92 --> 3327.64]  Dustin write
[3327.64 --> 3328.84]  is he still at a non-tech
[3328.84 --> 3329.74]  or what's the deal?
[3330.20 --> 3330.76]  No Dustin
[3330.76 --> 3332.36]  Dustin works for us now
[3332.36 --> 3333.76]  When did that happen?
[3334.92 --> 3336.58]  He started on October 1st
[3336.58 --> 3337.96]  so he started this month
[3337.96 --> 3339.46]  so yeah
[3339.46 --> 3340.46]  we hired Dustin
[3340.46 --> 3341.02]  he's local
[3341.02 --> 3341.68]  so we said
[3341.68 --> 3341.92]  hey
[3341.92 --> 3343.08]  the more guys
[3343.08 --> 3343.80]  who know the industry
[3343.80 --> 3344.46]  and know hardware
[3344.46 --> 3345.18]  the better
[3345.18 --> 3346.08]  that work at Corsair
[3346.08 --> 3348.14]  so we offered you
[3348.14 --> 3348.82]  a job too Linus
[3348.82 --> 3350.04]  but you live in Canada
[3350.04 --> 3351.74]  I know right?
[3352.62 --> 3354.30]  my dog sleds
[3354.30 --> 3355.14]  couldn't actually
[3355.14 --> 3355.76]  carry me
[3355.76 --> 3356.64]  all the way down there
[3356.64 --> 3357.66]  I would run out of snow
[3357.66 --> 3358.64]  so I couldn't figure out
[3358.64 --> 3359.28]  how I would actually
[3359.28 --> 3360.16]  move to California
[3360.16 --> 3362.10]  and we already have
[3362.10 --> 3362.50]  our quota
[3362.50 --> 3363.40]  of one Canadian guy
[3363.40 --> 3363.88]  with Terran
[3363.88 --> 3364.90]  so we can't really
[3364.90 --> 3365.68]  hire another one
[3365.68 --> 3368.46]  but yeah
[3368.46 --> 3369.04]  so like we're
[3369.04 --> 3369.70]  looking at
[3369.70 --> 3371.66]  hiring more
[3371.66 --> 3372.48]  what we call people
[3372.48 --> 3373.50]  with enthusiast DNA
[3373.50 --> 3374.84]  so Dustin definitely
[3374.84 --> 3375.18]  has it
[3375.18 --> 3375.86]  he knows the industry
[3375.86 --> 3376.72]  he knows that stuff
[3376.72 --> 3377.94]  so we want that
[3377.94 --> 3379.18]  that kind of person
[3379.18 --> 3379.86]  here at Corsair
[3379.86 --> 3381.16]  so with Dustin
[3381.16 --> 3381.96]  actually we asked him
[3381.96 --> 3382.42]  to look at this
[3382.42 --> 3382.94]  just to see
[3382.94 --> 3383.64]  hey you know
[3383.64 --> 3384.70]  play with the Battlefield 4 beta
[3384.70 --> 3385.60]  and see what you find out
[3385.60 --> 3386.12]  and one of the things
[3386.12 --> 3386.74]  he found was this
[3386.74 --> 3387.92]  which to be quite honest
[3387.92 --> 3388.88]  I could not believe it
[3388.88 --> 3389.50]  when I saw this
[3389.50 --> 3390.50]  I couldn't believe it
[3390.50 --> 3392.10]  because I was like
[3392.10 --> 3393.62]  it doesn't make any sense
[3393.62 --> 3394.48]  yeah consciously
[3394.48 --> 3395.62]  it doesn't make any damn sense
[3395.62 --> 3396.32]  you're looking at it
[3396.32 --> 3396.68]  and you're like
[3396.68 --> 3396.96]  what?
[3397.12 --> 3398.10]  that doesn't make sense
[3398.10 --> 3399.38]  and then obviously
[3399.38 --> 3400.38]  internally we're like
[3400.38 --> 3400.88]  well of course
[3400.88 --> 3401.44]  people are going to say
[3401.44 --> 3402.14]  Corsair says
[3402.14 --> 3403.50]  fast memory makes a difference
[3403.50 --> 3404.46]  because they sell fast memory
[3404.46 --> 3405.58]  and we're totally biased
[3405.58 --> 3406.00]  and everything
[3406.00 --> 3407.70]  but I've seen the benchmarks
[3407.70 --> 3408.34]  it makes a difference
[3408.34 --> 3409.02]  so next week
[3409.02 --> 3409.80]  when the game
[3409.80 --> 3410.84]  hits live
[3410.84 --> 3412.04]  and you guys can test it yourselves
[3412.04 --> 3413.22]  I highly recommend
[3413.22 --> 3413.74]  checking it out
[3413.74 --> 3414.34]  because it's weird
[3414.34 --> 3415.80]  we will validate this
[3415.80 --> 3417.16]  sorry go ahead
[3417.16 --> 3417.88]  I had actually already
[3417.88 --> 3418.54]  talked to Linus
[3418.54 --> 3418.86]  about this
[3418.86 --> 3420.02]  before I had seen this article
[3420.02 --> 3420.80]  and I had already
[3420.80 --> 3421.26]  talked to him
[3421.26 --> 3422.38]  about how our benchmarks
[3422.38 --> 3423.02]  for Battlefield 4
[3423.02 --> 3423.96]  are going to be interesting
[3423.96 --> 3425.42]  and I might want to do
[3425.42 --> 3426.72]  a whole bunch of extra stuff
[3426.72 --> 3427.74]  because we found
[3427.74 --> 3428.52]  a lot more usage
[3428.52 --> 3429.84]  on CPU than normal
[3429.84 --> 3430.88]  on a lot more cores
[3430.88 --> 3431.82]  and we found
[3431.82 --> 3433.10]  well I found
[3433.10 --> 3433.78]  and some other people
[3433.78 --> 3435.10]  that the memory
[3435.10 --> 3436.14]  was being used a lot more
[3436.14 --> 3436.78]  and people that had
[3436.78 --> 3438.44]  really high speed memory
[3438.44 --> 3439.26]  were actually getting
[3439.26 --> 3439.84]  more performance
[3439.84 --> 3440.80]  which is weird
[3440.80 --> 3441.12]  I know
[3441.12 --> 3442.22]  we just recently did a video
[3442.22 --> 3443.00]  about how it doesn't do that
[3443.00 --> 3443.82]  we just did a video
[3443.82 --> 3444.98]  where we took some games
[3444.98 --> 3445.94]  and we basically went
[3445.94 --> 3446.96]  look memory speed
[3446.96 --> 3447.96]  doesn't matter for gaming
[3447.96 --> 3449.82]  well I guess it's time
[3449.82 --> 3450.50]  to throw all that
[3450.50 --> 3450.94]  out the window
[3450.94 --> 3452.22]  because for one thing
[3452.22 --> 3453.42]  BF4 has
[3453.42 --> 3453.96]  I think
[3453.96 --> 3454.46]  what is it
[3454.46 --> 3456.20]  6 gigs is the requirement
[3456.20 --> 3457.82]  and then 8 gigs is recommended
[3457.82 --> 3459.06]  and then number 2
[3459.06 --> 3460.12]  if we're going to see
[3460.12 --> 3461.58]  at 1920x1080
[3461.58 --> 3463.64]  10% performance improvements
[3463.64 --> 3464.78]  in minimum FPS
[3464.78 --> 3465.98]  which is the one that matters
[3465.98 --> 3466.88]  we all know this
[3466.88 --> 3468.12]  and at
[3468.12 --> 3469.76]  Ifinity settings
[3469.76 --> 3471.14]  so 5760x1200
[3471.14 --> 3473.08]  over 20% performance improvements
[3473.08 --> 3474.84]  just from going from 1600
[3474.84 --> 3476.40]  to DDR3 2400
[3476.40 --> 3477.72]  this is a game changer
[3477.72 --> 3478.38]  for you guys
[3478.38 --> 3478.88]  all of a sudden
[3478.88 --> 3479.28]  you have something
[3479.28 --> 3480.16]  to talk about again
[3480.16 --> 3481.04]  on the memory side
[3481.04 --> 3482.12]  yeah
[3482.12 --> 3483.34]  we're really excited
[3483.34 --> 3483.78]  internally
[3483.78 --> 3484.34]  we finally
[3484.34 --> 3484.72]  you know
[3484.72 --> 3486.14]  we kiss the heat spreaders
[3486.14 --> 3487.00]  and send them out the door
[3487.00 --> 3487.72]  and we're ready to go
[3487.72 --> 3487.94]  but
[3487.94 --> 3488.72]  no the
[3488.72 --> 3490.68]  the difference is
[3490.68 --> 3491.52]  actually
[3491.52 --> 3492.60]  we're stoked about it
[3492.60 --> 3492.86]  because
[3492.86 --> 3493.96]  a couple years ago
[3493.96 --> 3494.24]  like
[3494.24 --> 3495.46]  well now like 5 years ago
[3495.46 --> 3496.52]  when Battlefield 2 came out
[3496.52 --> 3497.48]  we did a
[3497.48 --> 3498.10]  I did a blog
[3498.10 --> 3498.92]  because I found out
[3498.92 --> 3500.16]  that actually having like
[3500.16 --> 3500.68]  I think it was
[3500.68 --> 3502.22]  2 gig versus 4 gig
[3502.22 --> 3503.28]  or 4 gig versus 8 gig
[3503.28 --> 3503.58]  or something
[3503.58 --> 3504.20]  made a difference
[3504.20 --> 3505.26]  on big maps
[3505.26 --> 3505.68]  when you were
[3505.68 --> 3506.44]  on an airplane
[3506.44 --> 3507.52]  or in a helicopter
[3507.52 --> 3508.48]  when the map
[3508.48 --> 3509.14]  had to load
[3509.14 --> 3510.52]  a bunch of textures
[3510.52 --> 3511.04]  at once
[3511.04 --> 3512.52]  if you had 4 gigs of RAM
[3512.52 --> 3513.30]  or 8 gigs of RAM
[3513.30 --> 3513.72]  whatever it was
[3513.72 --> 3514.92]  it made a performance difference
[3514.92 --> 3515.76]  and so
[3515.76 --> 3516.76]  like we were stoked about it
[3516.76 --> 3517.22]  because Battlefield
[3517.22 --> 3518.52]  has always pushed hardware
[3518.52 --> 3519.78]  kind of in a special way
[3519.78 --> 3520.70]  like not quite
[3520.70 --> 3521.72]  like crisis level
[3521.72 --> 3522.76]  but it's always pushed hardware
[3522.76 --> 3523.78]  kind of interestingly
[3523.78 --> 3525.10]  so these guys are
[3525.10 --> 3526.12]  definitely putting
[3526.12 --> 3527.12]  a lot more effort
[3527.12 --> 3528.34]  into the CPU
[3528.34 --> 3528.88]  and memory
[3528.88 --> 3530.08]  than most guys are
[3530.08 --> 3532.32]  and I like the fact
[3532.32 --> 3533.16]  as a PC gamer
[3533.16 --> 3533.72]  I like the fact
[3533.72 --> 3534.16]  that they said
[3534.16 --> 3534.82]  they don't care
[3534.82 --> 3535.46]  what it looks like
[3535.46 --> 3536.02]  on consoles
[3536.02 --> 3537.12]  they want it to be fast
[3537.12 --> 3538.24]  and look good
[3538.24 --> 3539.14]  on PC first
[3539.14 --> 3540.70]  and that's their target
[3540.70 --> 3541.66]  and if it has to be
[3541.66 --> 3542.60]  dumbed down for consoles
[3542.60 --> 3543.34]  then so be it
[3543.34 --> 3544.38]  I like that approach
[3544.38 --> 3544.80]  better than
[3544.80 --> 3545.66]  well the console guys
[3545.66 --> 3546.08]  are complaining
[3546.08 --> 3547.06]  if it looks better on PC
[3547.06 --> 3548.90]  like screw that
[3548.90 --> 3549.60]  no actually
[3549.60 --> 3550.24]  console guys
[3550.24 --> 3551.68]  should suffer
[3551.68 --> 3552.74]  this was great
[3552.74 --> 3553.58]  I had a chance
[3553.58 --> 3554.30]  to have some
[3554.30 --> 3555.12]  one on one time
[3555.12 --> 3556.26]  with Johan Andersen
[3556.26 --> 3557.40]  who's their lead
[3557.40 --> 3558.46]  technical director
[3558.46 --> 3559.60]  for Frostbite
[3559.60 --> 3562.06]  and he basically
[3562.06 --> 3563.38]  was talking about
[3563.38 --> 3564.46]  how they're building
[3564.46 --> 3565.42]  Frostbite 3
[3565.42 --> 3567.08]  for the future
[3567.08 --> 3568.98]  like that's the idea
[3568.98 --> 3569.66]  what they're building
[3569.66 --> 3570.12]  right now
[3570.12 --> 3570.96]  this is a heavy
[3570.96 --> 3571.78]  heavy investment
[3571.78 --> 3573.30]  and they want this thing
[3573.30 --> 3574.52]  to scale
[3574.52 --> 3576.32]  to continue to scale
[3576.32 --> 3577.22]  with future hardware
[3577.22 --> 3578.10]  and I find that
[3578.10 --> 3579.22]  incredibly exciting
[3579.22 --> 3580.24]  and the fact that
[3580.24 --> 3580.98]  they've done such a
[3580.98 --> 3581.74]  great job
[3581.74 --> 3583.50]  for the first time
[3583.50 --> 3585.54]  in many hardware
[3585.54 --> 3586.16]  generations
[3586.16 --> 3587.26]  giving us a reason
[3587.26 --> 3588.02]  to have anything
[3588.02 --> 3589.28]  other than dual channel
[3589.28 --> 3590.34]  DDR2
[3590.34 --> 3591.84]  800 megahertz
[3591.84 --> 3593.34]  is fantastic
[3593.34 --> 3594.32]  I mean remember
[3594.32 --> 3595.44]  when DDR3
[3595.44 --> 3596.74]  first came into
[3596.74 --> 3597.42]  the limelight
[3597.42 --> 3598.78]  and it was like
[3598.78 --> 3600.06]  yeah there's
[3600.06 --> 3601.18]  no performance
[3601.18 --> 3601.62]  delta
[3601.62 --> 3602.22]  whatsoever
[3602.22 --> 3603.74]  and it's been
[3603.74 --> 3604.30]  that story
[3604.30 --> 3605.46]  for so long now
[3605.46 --> 3606.52]  this is great
[3606.52 --> 3607.40]  yeah it's been
[3607.40 --> 3608.24]  it's been tough
[3608.24 --> 3608.60]  to say
[3608.60 --> 3608.92]  I mean
[3608.92 --> 3610.26]  it's not a surprise
[3610.26 --> 3610.60]  to anybody
[3610.60 --> 3611.28]  we've never even
[3611.28 --> 3612.20]  claimed recently
[3612.20 --> 3613.14]  that there's been
[3613.14 --> 3613.98]  a gaming performance
[3613.98 --> 3614.90]  benefit from high end RAM
[3614.90 --> 3615.52]  it's always been
[3615.52 --> 3616.10]  like encoding
[3616.10 --> 3616.96]  or something like that
[3616.96 --> 3617.40]  because gaming
[3617.40 --> 3618.26]  is almost all
[3618.26 --> 3618.88]  GPU limited
[3618.88 --> 3619.70]  but now
[3619.70 --> 3620.40]  we're actually
[3620.40 --> 3621.02]  seeing some games
[3621.02 --> 3621.60]  take a difference
[3621.60 --> 3621.90]  again
[3621.90 --> 3622.56]  make a difference
[3622.56 --> 3622.78]  again
[3622.78 --> 3624.00]  so we're pretty
[3624.00 --> 3624.66]  excited about it
[3624.66 --> 3625.16]  I think that
[3625.16 --> 3625.54]  I mean
[3625.54 --> 3626.30]  I don't expect
[3626.30 --> 3626.90]  everyone to go out
[3626.90 --> 3627.42]  and buy like
[3627.42 --> 3627.60]  you know
[3627.60 --> 3629.06]  2933 megahertz
[3629.06 --> 3630.12]  dominator platinums
[3630.12 --> 3631.20]  and whatever else
[3631.20 --> 3631.42]  but
[3631.42 --> 3632.66]  a girl can dream
[3632.66 --> 3632.90]  right
[3632.90 --> 3633.78]  we could
[3633.78 --> 3635.56]  dream all you want
[3635.56 --> 3636.20]  yeah
[3636.20 --> 3638.62]  hint hint
[3638.62 --> 3640.02]  yeah yeah
[3640.02 --> 3640.52]  we could use
[3640.52 --> 3640.96]  some of those
[3640.96 --> 3641.54]  just throwing that
[3641.54 --> 3641.90]  out there
[3641.90 --> 3643.48]  yeah
[3643.48 --> 3644.90]  yeah
[3644.90 --> 3647.02]  that's
[3647.02 --> 3647.86]  that's gonna happen
[3647.86 --> 3648.52]  I can't even get
[3648.52 --> 3649.06]  those right now
[3649.06 --> 3649.36]  so
[3649.36 --> 3649.98]  yeah
[3649.98 --> 3651.34]  you know what's funny
[3651.34 --> 3652.20]  is I even had
[3652.20 --> 3652.80]  an opportunity
[3652.80 --> 3653.78]  to ask for some
[3653.78 --> 3654.38]  of the 3000
[3654.38 --> 3655.14]  megahertz ones
[3655.14 --> 3655.76]  back when those
[3655.76 --> 3656.20]  launched
[3656.20 --> 3657.66]  and I was just
[3657.66 --> 3658.24]  like you know
[3658.24 --> 3658.62]  what
[3658.62 --> 3660.12]  we won't really
[3660.12 --> 3660.86]  be able to do
[3660.86 --> 3661.64]  anything with them
[3661.64 --> 3662.00]  because
[3662.00 --> 3663.02]  what am I gonna
[3663.02 --> 3663.64]  say about these
[3663.64 --> 3664.40]  things other than
[3664.40 --> 3665.42]  like hey
[3665.42 --> 3666.28]  Corsair made this
[3666.28 --> 3667.18]  RAM it's totally
[3667.18 --> 3667.62]  unnecessary
[3667.62 --> 3668.36]  who cares
[3668.36 --> 3669.90]  yeah exactly
[3669.90 --> 3670.58]  I was like I don't
[3670.58 --> 3671.24]  want you guys to
[3671.24 --> 3671.92]  give me something
[3671.92 --> 3672.58]  that there's
[3672.58 --> 3673.34]  nothing for me to
[3673.34 --> 3674.06]  say about other
[3674.06 --> 3674.72]  than that
[3674.72 --> 3675.56]  so
[3675.56 --> 3676.38]  no there's
[3676.38 --> 3677.40]  you know it's
[3677.40 --> 3677.96]  it's kind of like
[3677.96 --> 3678.74]  once something has
[3678.74 --> 3679.26]  reached that kind
[3679.26 --> 3680.08]  of commodity scale
[3680.08 --> 3680.74]  like you know
[3680.74 --> 3681.14]  what do you want
[3681.14 --> 3681.74]  to review toothpaste
[3681.74 --> 3682.60]  next where you
[3682.60 --> 3683.40]  say like my teeth
[3683.40 --> 3684.16]  still feel clean
[3684.16 --> 3685.04]  so good luck
[3685.04 --> 3685.84]  Colgate you know
[3685.84 --> 3686.88]  my mouth tastes
[3686.88 --> 3687.34]  great
[3687.34 --> 3689.00]  we should totally
[3689.00 --> 3689.78]  do a toothpaste
[3689.78 --> 3690.40]  unboxing
[3690.40 --> 3690.88]  you should have
[3690.88 --> 3691.38]  just take the
[3691.38 --> 3691.72]  toothpaste
[3691.72 --> 3692.70]  and be like
[3692.70 --> 3693.24]  ah
[3693.24 --> 3695.30]  you have to try
[3695.30 --> 3696.04]  and talk about it
[3696.04 --> 3696.62]  while you're brushing
[3696.62 --> 3698.14]  like yards of
[3698.14 --> 3698.68]  toothpaste
[3698.68 --> 3699.20]  perfume
[3699.20 --> 3699.90]  and just like
[3699.90 --> 3700.66]  strip it down the
[3700.66 --> 3700.96]  street
[3700.96 --> 3702.28]  we could do
[3702.28 --> 3703.06]  speed tests
[3703.06 --> 3703.76]  so like if you
[3703.76 --> 3705.58]  if you squeeze it
[3705.58 --> 3706.16]  how fast it's
[3706.16 --> 3706.68]  actually come out
[3706.68 --> 3707.38]  or like if you
[3707.38 --> 3707.90]  slam it
[3707.90 --> 3709.00]  durability of the
[3709.00 --> 3709.36]  tube
[3709.36 --> 3710.48]  we could pack it
[3710.48 --> 3711.22]  into your backpack
[3711.22 --> 3712.44]  and like
[3712.44 --> 3713.60]  slam an entire
[3713.60 --> 3714.04]  tube
[3714.04 --> 3715.86]  if you have it
[3715.86 --> 3716.38]  in your luggage
[3716.38 --> 3716.84]  just eat an entire
[3716.84 --> 3717.64]  tube of aqua fresh
[3717.64 --> 3718.52]  how many sharp
[3718.52 --> 3719.22]  things can be in
[3719.22 --> 3719.66]  your luggage
[3719.66 --> 3720.44]  before the tube
[3720.44 --> 3721.12]  gets punctured
[3721.12 --> 3721.86]  and spills all
[3721.86 --> 3722.48]  over everything
[3722.48 --> 3724.08]  yeah and then
[3724.08 --> 3724.72]  how quickly do you
[3724.72 --> 3725.30]  get put in the
[3725.30 --> 3726.06]  TSA prison
[3726.06 --> 3727.64]  we need it
[3727.64 --> 3728.64]  yeah because
[3728.64 --> 3729.04]  there would be
[3729.04 --> 3729.62]  this gel
[3729.62 --> 3730.08]  all over
[3730.08 --> 3730.42]  everything
[3730.42 --> 3731.04]  in your bag
[3731.04 --> 3731.92]  it would smell
[3731.92 --> 3732.50]  minty fresh
[3732.50 --> 3732.76]  though
[3732.76 --> 3734.56]  that's a terrible
[3734.56 --> 3734.88]  job
[3734.88 --> 3735.54]  someone's job
[3735.54 --> 3736.10]  is to test
[3736.10 --> 3736.66]  the viscosity
[3736.66 --> 3737.22]  of toothpaste
[3737.22 --> 3737.86]  that's like
[3737.86 --> 3738.52]  someone has to
[3738.52 --> 3738.88]  do that
[3738.88 --> 3739.50]  someone has to
[3739.50 --> 3739.76]  sit there
[3739.76 --> 3740.12]  and make sure
[3740.12 --> 3740.60]  that every
[3740.60 --> 3741.60]  like batch
[3741.60 --> 3742.20]  of aqua fresh
[3742.20 --> 3742.72]  has the same
[3742.72 --> 3743.20]  viscosity
[3743.20 --> 3744.16]  and it's not
[3744.16 --> 3744.58]  too runny
[3744.58 --> 3745.78]  or too pasty
[3745.78 --> 3746.26]  because they're
[3746.26 --> 3746.72]  like this is
[3746.72 --> 3747.32]  the sweet spot
[3747.32 --> 3747.80]  this is what
[3747.80 --> 3748.34]  we've determined
[3748.34 --> 3748.94]  through market
[3748.94 --> 3749.50]  research
[3749.50 --> 3750.16]  this is what
[3750.16 --> 3750.70]  people like
[3750.70 --> 3751.86]  you know what
[3751.86 --> 3752.60]  sometimes my
[3752.60 --> 3753.26]  job's kind of
[3753.26 --> 3753.94]  hard but then
[3753.94 --> 3755.02]  I tell myself
[3755.02 --> 3756.20]  like yeah at
[3756.20 --> 3756.66]  least I don't
[3756.66 --> 3757.24]  have to do
[3757.24 --> 3757.68]  that
[3757.68 --> 3758.10]  at least you
[3758.10 --> 3758.40]  don't have to
[3758.40 --> 3758.76]  test the
[3758.76 --> 3759.40]  viscosity of
[3759.40 --> 3759.82]  toothpaste
[3759.82 --> 3761.76]  exactly
[3761.76 --> 3762.68]  it could be
[3762.68 --> 3762.98]  worse
[3762.98 --> 3763.52]  I could be
[3763.52 --> 3763.90]  the toothpaste
[3763.90 --> 3764.32]  guy
[3764.32 --> 3764.66]  but the
[3764.66 --> 3764.92]  toothpaste
[3764.92 --> 3765.46]  guy is like
[3765.46 --> 3765.82]  at least I
[3765.82 --> 3766.08]  don't do
[3766.08 --> 3766.46]  mayonnaise
[3766.46 --> 3767.00]  you know
[3767.00 --> 3770.04]  alright so
[3770.04 --> 3770.80]  the last thing
[3770.80 --> 3771.54]  for you George
[3771.54 --> 3772.06]  is we've got
[3772.06 --> 3772.92]  a twitter blitz
[3772.92 --> 3773.56]  so we've asked
[3773.56 --> 3774.18]  our guys to
[3774.18 --> 3775.52]  ask you some
[3775.52 --> 3776.08]  you know quick
[3776.08 --> 3776.70]  questions and
[3776.70 --> 3777.78]  the idea is
[3777.78 --> 3778.88]  as soon as you
[3778.88 --> 3779.54]  hear the question
[3779.54 --> 3780.12]  you answer it
[3780.12 --> 3780.68]  as quickly as
[3780.68 --> 3781.62]  you can and
[3781.62 --> 3782.34]  we move on
[3782.34 --> 3783.50]  to the next
[3783.50 --> 3784.50]  one so
[3784.50 --> 3786.04]  here we go
[3786.04 --> 3786.62]  so I asked
[3786.62 --> 3787.14]  them to send
[3787.14 --> 3787.80]  in some questions
[3787.80 --> 3788.46]  for George
[3788.46 --> 3789.68]  and for whatever
[3789.68 --> 3791.16]  reason Chrome
[3791.16 --> 3791.86]  is being
[3791.86 --> 3793.62]  a turd for me
[3793.62 --> 3794.24]  here so
[3794.24 --> 3795.40]  yeah it's doing
[3795.40 --> 3795.92]  that thing where
[3795.92 --> 3796.80]  I try to scroll
[3796.80 --> 3797.58]  it and it's just
[3797.58 --> 3798.70]  not being very
[3798.70 --> 3799.70]  cooperative so
[3799.70 --> 3802.18]  here we go
[3802.18 --> 3802.76]  I remember
[3802.76 --> 3803.40]  so here it
[3803.40 --> 3804.24]  goes it's back
[3804.24 --> 3805.88]  when is
[3805.88 --> 3806.78]  what is
[3806.78 --> 3807.48]  Corsair going
[3807.48 --> 3808.22]  to do to
[3808.22 --> 3809.10]  make Hydro
[3809.10 --> 3810.10]  series better
[3810.10 --> 3812.32]  we're always
[3812.32 --> 3812.84]  pushing the
[3812.84 --> 3813.16]  level of
[3813.16 --> 3813.54]  performance
[3813.54 --> 3814.32]  quickly so
[3814.32 --> 3815.14]  better performance
[3815.14 --> 3816.16]  stuff easier
[3816.16 --> 3817.04]  to install and
[3817.04 --> 3817.96]  working on better
[3817.96 --> 3819.14]  noise control
[3819.14 --> 3819.86]  stuff so that
[3819.86 --> 3820.70]  you guys that
[3820.70 --> 3821.18]  want to make it
[3821.18 --> 3821.76]  quieter can make
[3821.76 --> 3822.26]  it quieter and
[3822.26 --> 3822.64]  those you guys
[3822.64 --> 3823.10]  who want to go
[3823.10 --> 3823.76]  for the performance
[3823.76 --> 3824.20]  can make it
[3824.20 --> 3825.34]  faster that's
[3825.34 --> 3825.98]  that's the end
[3825.98 --> 3826.48]  goal cooler
[3826.48 --> 3827.24]  quieter easier
[3827.24 --> 3827.96]  to install every
[3827.96 --> 3828.64]  generation gets
[3828.64 --> 3828.92]  better
[3828.92 --> 3830.42]  speaking of which
[3830.42 --> 3830.94]  this is another
[3830.94 --> 3831.66]  great follow-up
[3831.66 --> 3832.48]  question question
[3832.48 --> 3833.30]  for George is
[3833.30 --> 3834.20]  Corsair planning an
[3834.20 --> 3835.90]  H110i so
[3835.90 --> 3836.40]  something with
[3836.40 --> 3837.08]  Corsair link
[3837.08 --> 3838.28]  speaking of
[3838.28 --> 3839.06]  better control
[3839.06 --> 3839.42]  and fan
[3839.42 --> 3840.10]  profiles and
[3840.10 --> 3840.74]  pump profiles
[3840.74 --> 3842.86]  so two things
[3842.86 --> 3844.16]  yeah we will
[3844.16 --> 3844.86]  eventually I'm
[3844.86 --> 3845.82]  sure have a
[3845.82 --> 3846.36]  Corsair link
[3846.36 --> 3846.94]  version of the
[3846.94 --> 3847.20]  high-end
[3847.20 --> 3847.78]  coolers like
[3847.78 --> 3849.16]  the 110i and
[3849.16 --> 3849.54]  then the other
[3849.54 --> 3850.04]  side of it is
[3850.04 --> 3850.92]  Corsair link is
[3850.92 --> 3851.94]  being significantly
[3851.94 --> 3852.64]  revamped as
[3852.64 --> 3853.08]  well so we're
[3853.08 --> 3853.74]  having we're
[3853.74 --> 3854.28]  doing much much
[3854.28 --> 3854.98]  better versions of
[3854.98 --> 3856.10]  Corsair link and
[3856.10 --> 3856.44]  they're in
[3856.44 --> 3857.18]  development now too
[3857.18 --> 3857.88]  so we've actually
[3857.88 --> 3859.28]  the 2.5 software
[3859.28 --> 3860.02]  is going to be
[3860.02 --> 3860.58]  launched in beta
[3860.58 --> 3861.22]  pretty quick and
[3861.22 --> 3862.10]  that has a lot of
[3862.10 --> 3863.04]  bug fixes and
[3863.04 --> 3864.10]  Windows 8.1
[3864.10 --> 3865.02]  compatibility and all
[3865.02 --> 3866.02]  that stuff so
[3866.02 --> 3866.44]  we're gonna have
[3866.44 --> 3867.42]  some stuff ready to
[3867.42 --> 3867.94]  go on our forums
[3867.94 --> 3868.64]  pretty quickly for
[3868.64 --> 3869.78]  that George will
[3869.78 --> 3870.96]  there ever be SP
[3870.96 --> 3873.06]  140s and will we
[3873.06 --> 3873.94]  ever see LED
[3873.94 --> 3874.98]  versions of SP
[3874.98 --> 3877.20]  series fans yes
[3877.20 --> 3877.56]  there will
[3877.56 --> 3878.36]  eventually be SP
[3878.36 --> 3879.80]  140s I can't
[3879.80 --> 3880.24]  give you a better
[3880.24 --> 3881.00]  date on that but
[3881.00 --> 3881.70]  there will be SP
[3881.70 --> 3883.30]  140s the LED
[3883.30 --> 3884.02]  versions of the SP
[3884.02 --> 3884.78]  series fans if
[3884.78 --> 3885.56]  enough people ask
[3885.56 --> 3886.40]  us for them then
[3886.40 --> 3887.18]  yeah we can do
[3887.18 --> 3887.80]  that pretty quickly
[3887.80 --> 3888.94]  but I just you
[3888.94 --> 3889.44]  know I don't know
[3889.44 --> 3890.00]  that there's a lot
[3890.00 --> 3890.56]  of guys putting
[3890.56 --> 3891.94]  LED fans on their
[3891.94 --> 3892.56]  radiators or
[3892.56 --> 3893.20]  heat sinks most
[3893.20 --> 3893.68]  people put them in
[3893.68 --> 3894.54]  their cases and
[3894.54 --> 3895.12]  the side panels
[3895.12 --> 3895.70]  and front panels
[3895.70 --> 3896.94]  but if they really
[3896.94 --> 3898.32]  want LED SP fans
[3898.32 --> 3899.36]  and they bug us
[3899.36 --> 3900.06]  on Facebook about
[3900.06 --> 3900.60]  it enough then
[3900.60 --> 3901.30]  yeah we'll do it
[3901.30 --> 3901.96]  I'm gonna throw
[3901.96 --> 3902.82]  this at you George
[3902.82 --> 3904.12]  some people are
[3904.12 --> 3905.28]  obsessive compulsive
[3905.28 --> 3906.30]  enough that they're
[3906.30 --> 3907.50]  just not willing to
[3907.50 --> 3908.76]  buy different fans to
[3908.76 --> 3909.52]  put in different parts
[3909.52 --> 3910.52]  of their system and
[3910.52 --> 3911.22]  they want all the
[3911.22 --> 3912.82]  same fans and
[3912.82 --> 3913.80]  someone's pointing at
[3913.80 --> 3914.42]  me I have no idea
[3914.42 --> 3915.16]  what his problem is
[3915.16 --> 3917.02]  so for me because
[3917.02 --> 3918.58]  AF series fans for
[3918.58 --> 3920.26]  me are much worse on
[3920.26 --> 3920.84]  heat sinks and
[3920.84 --> 3921.92]  radiators compared to
[3921.92 --> 3923.56]  SP and SP isn't
[3923.56 --> 3924.22]  really that much
[3924.22 --> 3925.00]  worse in an open
[3925.00 --> 3925.78]  airflow environment
[3925.78 --> 3926.72]  compared to AF
[3926.72 --> 3927.78]  series if I was
[3927.78 --> 3929.18]  gonna pick one I
[3929.18 --> 3930.76]  would pick SP and
[3930.76 --> 3931.72]  so that is my
[3931.72 --> 3932.94]  justification for
[3932.94 --> 3934.56]  LED SP fans needing
[3934.56 --> 3935.84]  to exist just
[3935.84 --> 3936.56]  throwing all right
[3936.56 --> 3938.22]  so we'll do we'll
[3938.22 --> 3939.72]  do a Linus edition
[3939.72 --> 3941.70]  LED with like your
[3941.70 --> 3942.86]  face on the low the
[3942.86 --> 3943.76]  hub label so that it
[3943.76 --> 3944.42]  spins around really
[3944.42 --> 3945.14]  quickly but then when
[3945.14 --> 3945.94]  it's off you can tell
[3945.94 --> 3946.76]  it's a Linus fan
[3946.76 --> 3947.96]  can I be giving like a
[3947.96 --> 3948.64]  thumbs up and be
[3948.64 --> 3949.42]  wearing like like
[3949.42 --> 3950.30]  awesome corsair
[3950.30 --> 3951.16]  sunglasses that are
[3951.16 --> 3952.88]  like this big yeah
[3952.88 --> 3953.52]  we can have giant
[3953.52 --> 3954.64]  sunglasses and like a
[3954.64 --> 3955.58]  little like caricature
[3955.58 --> 3956.52]  of you on the box
[3956.52 --> 3957.70]  that'd be awesome if
[3957.70 --> 3959.04]  you guys do a Linus
[3959.04 --> 3961.06]  edition product then I
[3961.06 --> 3962.28]  will give you guys
[3962.28 --> 3963.98]  three thousand dollars
[3963.98 --> 3965.46]  of free advertising on
[3965.46 --> 3966.08]  Linus Tech Tips
[3966.08 --> 3968.10]  YouTube channel there
[3968.10 --> 3969.62]  that's my that's my
[3969.62 --> 3970.42]  careful what you wish
[3970.42 --> 3971.02]  for small
[3971.02 --> 3972.82]  which product all
[3972.82 --> 3973.52]  right well that's by
[3973.52 --> 3974.38]  which product okay no
[3974.38 --> 3975.14]  hold on a second I
[3975.14 --> 3975.86]  don't want a Linus
[3975.86 --> 3977.02]  edition USB butt plug
[3977.02 --> 3977.86]  because that would be
[3977.86 --> 3978.94]  too predictable we
[3978.94 --> 3979.88]  almost made it through
[3979.88 --> 3981.38]  a stream well I
[3981.38 --> 3981.86]  have to take
[3981.86 --> 3982.44]  something off the
[3982.44 --> 3986.02]  roadmap now I have
[3986.02 --> 3986.56]  to go I have to go
[3986.56 --> 3987.12]  talk to our USB
[3987.12 --> 3987.88]  person and say hey
[3987.88 --> 3991.20]  kill that all right
[3991.20 --> 3992.46]  why doesn't Corsair
[3992.46 --> 3993.40]  become a system
[3993.40 --> 3996.08]  builder because all
[3996.08 --> 3996.84]  our competitors do
[3996.84 --> 3999.22]  that that's what our
[3999.22 --> 4000.02]  competitors are doing
[4000.02 --> 4001.78]  that's uh I mean
[4001.78 --> 4002.84]  not our competitors I'm
[4002.84 --> 4003.52]  sorry that's what
[4003.52 --> 4004.18]  most of our customers
[4004.18 --> 4004.76]  are doing so if you
[4004.76 --> 4005.52]  go to like cyber
[4005.52 --> 4006.62]  power and and
[4006.62 --> 4007.42]  digital storm and
[4007.42 --> 4008.04]  those guys oh
[4008.04 --> 4008.52]  because I thought you
[4008.52 --> 4009.38]  were taking a shot at
[4009.38 --> 4010.72]  those one guys that
[4010.72 --> 4011.86]  uh sort of no no no
[4011.86 --> 4013.10]  exists and sort of a
[4013.10 --> 4013.84]  thing okay actually
[4013.84 --> 4014.74]  carry on I just kind
[4014.74 --> 4015.36]  of forgot how to
[4015.36 --> 4016.58]  speak English uh for a
[4016.58 --> 4017.24]  second and I forgot
[4017.24 --> 4018.52]  what words mean no
[4018.52 --> 4020.30]  um realistically the
[4020.30 --> 4022.00]  uh the trick is that
[4022.00 --> 4022.92]  uh we wanted to make
[4022.92 --> 4025.12]  sure that um that we
[4025.12 --> 4026.02]  got the best product
[4026.02 --> 4027.30]  for our suppliers and
[4027.30 --> 4027.98]  stuff like that and
[4027.98 --> 4028.74]  actually that's a
[4028.74 --> 4029.22]  completely different
[4029.22 --> 4030.20]  skill set you know
[4030.20 --> 4030.90]  building up a system
[4030.90 --> 4031.70]  and then selling it to
[4031.70 --> 4032.36]  people that's different
[4032.36 --> 4033.40]  than selling hobby parts
[4033.40 --> 4035.18]  fair enough what the
[4035.18 --> 4037.38]  hell was that he's
[4037.38 --> 4038.08]  pulling something out of
[4038.08 --> 4038.86]  his bag yeah my
[4038.86 --> 4039.62]  battery's about to
[4039.62 --> 4040.60]  die on my laptop which
[4040.60 --> 4041.14]  is going to be a real
[4041.14 --> 4042.66]  problem for me so uh
[4042.66 --> 4043.80]  here do you have a do
[4043.80 --> 4044.32]  you have a plug that
[4044.32 --> 4045.98]  you can yeah get that
[4045.98 --> 4047.40]  into all right all right
[4047.40 --> 4048.02]  I think we're going to
[4048.02 --> 4048.88]  take two more twitter
[4048.88 --> 4051.02]  blitz questions um okay
[4051.02 --> 4052.92]  george we all know
[4052.92 --> 4054.04]  corsair makes some sweet
[4054.04 --> 4055.02]  premium stuff so would
[4055.02 --> 4055.80]  you consider doing
[4055.80 --> 4056.78]  graphics cards
[4056.78 --> 4060.86]  oof um a couple years
[4060.86 --> 4061.96]  ago I think it was uh
[4061.96 --> 4062.68]  donald trump said
[4062.68 --> 4063.18]  something about the
[4063.18 --> 4064.08]  airline industry like
[4064.08 --> 4064.92]  it's a lot of it's a
[4064.92 --> 4065.74]  good way to lose a lot of
[4065.74 --> 4066.84]  money really really fast
[4066.84 --> 4068.30]  and I feel the same way
[4068.30 --> 4069.10]  about the graphics card
[4069.10 --> 4070.74]  business like you have
[4070.74 --> 4071.72]  to be really really quick
[4071.72 --> 4072.66]  to be on the ball and
[4072.66 --> 4073.60]  it's all controlled kind
[4073.60 --> 4074.74]  of by amd and nvidia and
[4074.74 --> 4075.60]  what their chip allocation
[4075.60 --> 4076.88]  is so whoever they decide
[4076.88 --> 4078.42]  to give the chips to is
[4078.42 --> 4079.50]  who gets the the best
[4079.50 --> 4080.86]  cards and I don't really
[4080.86 --> 4081.68]  want to play that game
[4081.68 --> 4082.68]  we do it we do it enough
[4082.68 --> 4083.98]  with uh kind of really
[4083.98 --> 4085.02]  tight stuff with the
[4085.02 --> 4086.28]  memory I'd rather work on
[4086.28 --> 4087.62]  the the other stuff
[4087.62 --> 4088.90]  especially because evga
[4088.90 --> 4089.98]  and asus and those guys
[4089.98 --> 4090.70]  are doing a really good
[4090.70 --> 4091.58]  job on the graphics card
[4091.58 --> 4092.66]  front I'll just kind of
[4092.66 --> 4094.52]  let them have that um I
[4094.52 --> 4095.36]  don't really want to
[4095.36 --> 4096.08]  fight them on that one
[4096.08 --> 4096.86]  I mean I'm not saying
[4096.86 --> 4097.64]  never but I'm saying
[4097.64 --> 4098.58]  right now I wouldn't do
[4098.58 --> 4100.60]  it I have this is not a
[4100.60 --> 4101.74]  twitter blitz question but
[4101.74 --> 4103.56]  I would love to see
[4103.56 --> 4104.38]  there's a particular
[4104.38 --> 4105.42]  market that I want
[4105.42 --> 4106.58]  corsair in that maybe
[4106.58 --> 4107.50]  I'll I don't want to
[4107.50 --> 4108.64]  give away anything but
[4108.64 --> 4109.96]  uh ping me or something
[4109.96 --> 4110.92]  I'll I'll reach out to
[4110.92 --> 4111.80]  you separately because I
[4111.80 --> 4112.60]  think it would be uh it
[4112.60 --> 4113.36]  would be awesome because
[4113.36 --> 4114.90]  I think there's still at
[4114.90 --> 4116.40]  least one category within
[4116.40 --> 4118.46]  the sort of the finished
[4118.46 --> 4120.50]  pc ecosystem corsair's not
[4120.50 --> 4121.26]  in yet that you could
[4121.26 --> 4122.70]  really contribute to and
[4122.70 --> 4123.66]  guys I'd love you know
[4123.66 --> 4124.32]  what I'd love to see
[4124.32 --> 4125.36]  your twitter comments or
[4125.36 --> 4126.36]  I'd love to see your uh
[4126.36 --> 4126.98]  your thoughts in the
[4126.98 --> 4127.86]  twitch chat figure out
[4127.86 --> 4128.44]  what you think I'm
[4128.44 --> 4129.76]  talking about all right
[4129.76 --> 4131.12]  so last one for george
[4131.12 --> 4133.12]  this is for george I have
[4133.12 --> 4134.88]  a 350d and I wanted to
[4134.88 --> 4135.80]  know what's better
[4135.80 --> 4137.82]  positive or negative air
[4137.82 --> 4139.44]  pressure with an h100i at
[4139.44 --> 4142.52]  the top you're not going
[4142.52 --> 4144.02]  to see a huge difference to
[4144.02 --> 4144.94]  be quite honestly with
[4144.94 --> 4145.82]  positive and negative what
[4145.82 --> 4147.26]  we found in our testing in
[4147.26 --> 4148.40]  the lab in the controlled
[4148.40 --> 4149.94]  environment in our ovens is
[4149.94 --> 4152.00]  that matching in intake and
[4152.00 --> 4154.16]  out uh exhaust rather out
[4154.16 --> 4155.62]  take what's that intake and
[4155.62 --> 4157.90]  exhaust matching is the is
[4157.90 --> 4158.94]  the key so if you get a
[4158.94 --> 4160.08]  really close match you're
[4160.08 --> 4160.96]  better off there's all
[4160.96 --> 4162.48]  kinds of stuff online about
[4162.48 --> 4163.32]  no you know positive
[4163.32 --> 4164.34]  pressure is better but
[4164.34 --> 4165.28]  negative pressure is better
[4165.28 --> 4166.64]  and and then you know one
[4166.64 --> 4167.36]  of them will provide more
[4167.36 --> 4168.72]  dust we've tested it a
[4168.72 --> 4169.64]  bunch of different times
[4169.64 --> 4170.36]  and what we've seen
[4170.36 --> 4172.10]  constantly is that if you
[4172.10 --> 4173.28]  get them close to match
[4173.28 --> 4174.62]  and your cfm is about the
[4174.62 --> 4176.34]  same intake and exhaust you
[4176.34 --> 4177.64]  get the best performance the
[4177.64 --> 4179.34]  the problem is if you put too
[4179.34 --> 4180.60]  much exhaust the hot air
[4180.60 --> 4181.46]  doesn't you don't have
[4181.46 --> 4182.42]  enough air inside to heat
[4182.42 --> 4183.38]  up if you get too much
[4183.38 --> 4184.22]  intake you don't have
[4184.22 --> 4185.28]  enough exhausting the hot
[4185.28 --> 4186.38]  air so you have to get
[4186.38 --> 4187.86]  close to match so the goal
[4187.86 --> 4189.40]  is measure your cfm and
[4189.40 --> 4191.72]  balance it all right well
[4191.72 --> 4192.68]  you know what i think
[4192.68 --> 4194.72]  that's uh i think that's
[4194.72 --> 4195.68]  pretty much it from our
[4195.68 --> 4197.80]  side uh thank you very much
[4197.80 --> 4199.10]  for joining us this was
[4199.10 --> 4200.84]  awesome and very educational
[4200.84 --> 4204.36]  and uh guys please tweet at
[4204.36 --> 4206.82]  corsair memory on twitter or
[4206.82 --> 4207.72]  you know hit them up on
[4207.72 --> 4209.24]  facebook give them a big
[4209.24 --> 4210.50]  thanks for allocating some
[4210.50 --> 4211.82]  of george's valuable time
[4211.82 --> 4212.84]  for us here on the show
[4212.84 --> 4213.84]  today and george again
[4213.84 --> 4215.04]  thank you personally for
[4215.04 --> 4216.80]  taking the time and uh if

[4230.98 --> 4232.82]  forums uh i occasionally on
[4232.82 --> 4234.34]  your forums linus uh and
[4234.34 --> 4235.90]  linus and a couple other
[4235.90 --> 4237.40]  people's forums sorry i almost
[4237.40 --> 4238.56]  called you an operating system
[4238.56 --> 4240.50]  um and then first time a

[4250.68 --> 4251.96]  guys like george that are
[4251.96 --> 4253.62]  accessible to the community i
[4253.62 --> 4254.66]  think the uh the pc
[4254.66 --> 4255.72]  enthusiast market would be a
[4255.72 --> 4257.10]  better place thanks again man
[4257.10 --> 4258.66]  take care see you later all
[4258.66 --> 4259.60]  right talk to you guys later bye
[4259.60 --> 4262.86]  bye all right so guys that
[4262.86 --> 4264.50]  was george from corsair so
[4264.50 --> 4266.26]  let's just completely overtake
[4266.26 --> 4268.74]  their facebook page and uh
[4268.74 --> 4271.14]  just destroy it with requests
[4271.14 --> 4274.32]  for sp series led fans as well
[4274.32 --> 4276.72]  as 140 millimeter sp fans let's
[4276.72 --> 4278.10]  see if we can make some magic
[4278.10 --> 4280.98]  happen here guys i couldn't hear
[4280.98 --> 4283.46]  bloody anything i know i'm
[4283.46 --> 4285.60]  sorry no it's i i think i don't
[4285.60 --> 4286.68]  know what's going on i think the
[4286.68 --> 4288.02]  port on the amp must be pretty
[4288.02 --> 4289.30]  much dead or something because it
[4289.30 --> 4290.66]  was also crackling the whole way
[4290.66 --> 4291.92]  through that's in the land you
[4291.92 --> 4292.88]  can hear him though so that was
[4292.88 --> 4293.94]  good that's one of the reasons why
[4293.94 --> 4295.84]  didn't chime in too much i'm like
[4295.84 --> 4298.68]  i think i heard something i know
[4298.68 --> 4300.54]  i know anyway thank you for
[4300.54 --> 4302.02]  taking one for the team there but
[4302.02 --> 4304.52]  uh let's uh let's move on into our
[4304.52 --> 4306.16]  next topic here i think that's
[4306.16 --> 4308.56]  man oh oh should we should we
[4308.56 --> 4309.98]  wait one or should we just go for
[4309.98 --> 4311.94]  it right now let's let's you know
[4311.94 --> 4313.60]  what let's do google's iron grip on
[4313.60 --> 4315.20]  android titans first so this is an
[4315.20 --> 4317.58]  ars technica article and let's go
[4317.58 --> 4318.86]  ahead and fire this up so i'm gonna
[4318.86 --> 4320.26]  let you handle most of this one
[4320.26 --> 4321.46]  because this is something you feel
[4321.46 --> 4323.22]  pretty strongly about is and you're
[4323.22 --> 4324.38]  gonna need a little bit of a cooler
[4324.38 --> 4326.22]  before i'm gonna i gotta i gotta
[4326.22 --> 4328.28]  prepare myself for the mantle versus
[4328.28 --> 4330.48]  g-sync rant that's about to happen
[4330.48 --> 4333.18]  here okay so quite a few times in the
[4333.18 --> 4334.32]  last few live streams people have
[4334.32 --> 4335.88]  heard me say that i've noticed that
[4335.88 --> 4337.38]  google seems to be tightening down and
[4337.38 --> 4339.36]  changing who they are there seems to
[4339.36 --> 4340.84]  be changing their face they're not the
[4340.84 --> 4342.18]  google that we've dealt with in the
[4342.18 --> 4344.76]  past and there's a few things that's
[4344.76 --> 4346.20]  been changing especially focused on the
[4346.20 --> 4348.72]  android operating system so the aosp the
[4348.72 --> 4351.34]  android open source project is kind of
[4351.34 --> 4353.98]  being abandoned in certain ways so how
[4353.98 --> 4355.96]  that's happening is we've seen stuff
[4355.96 --> 4359.26]  like messaging i'm going to forget some
[4359.26 --> 4360.60]  of them now but like messaging and
[4360.60 --> 4362.10]  music and all these different apps that
[4362.10 --> 4364.18]  they used to have and are still there get
[4364.18 --> 4366.18]  basically abandoned they're not
[4366.18 --> 4367.50]  developing for them anymore and what
[4367.50 --> 4369.08]  they've done is they've done is another
[4369.08 --> 4371.48]  one search yeah aosp search so these
[4371.48 --> 4372.86]  things are still around but they're
[4372.86 --> 4375.20]  archaic at this point and no one is
[4375.20 --> 4376.28]  really using them because they have
[4376.28 --> 4377.42]  released new versions that they're
[4377.42 --> 4378.68]  actually developing for
[4378.68 --> 4380.68]  music new versions calendar
[4380.68 --> 4383.42]  keyboard if you just keep going through
[4383.42 --> 4384.68]  there's even more i believe yep
[4384.68 --> 4387.92]  camera messaging i brought that one up
[4387.92 --> 4390.20]  yep and then the next one that's coming
[4390.20 --> 4392.96]  up is is photos or i think it's like
[4392.96 --> 4394.46]  google yeah google pictures or something
[4394.46 --> 4395.60]  like that so they're gonna be really
[4395.60 --> 4397.40]  they're gonna be removing that well not
[4397.40 --> 4399.26]  really removing it's still there the aosp
[4399.26 --> 4400.94]  version is still there but the release
[4400.94 --> 4402.44]  enclosed versions so what they've
[4402.44 --> 4404.84]  trying to do is force everyone to use
[4404.84 --> 4406.16]  their own apps because if you want to
[4406.16 --> 4408.50]  use any of these apps you have to join
[4408.50 --> 4410.36]  the i don't remember exactly what's
[4410.36 --> 4411.44]  called but it's like the android
[4411.44 --> 4413.18]  alliance or something like that and if
[4413.18 --> 4414.98]  you're within the android alliance you
[4414.98 --> 4416.30]  can't really leave or else it gets
[4416.30 --> 4417.74]  messy and when you're inside of it you
[4417.74 --> 4421.46]  can only manufacture approved devices the
[4421.46 --> 4423.62]  open handset alliance there we go it's
[4423.62 --> 4427.22]  called so a sir tried to leave and they
[4427.22 --> 4429.80]  tried to do something else and that was
[4429.80 --> 4431.12]  a big problem that was a really
[4431.12 --> 4432.80]  really well and they would they google
[4432.80 --> 4434.60]  basically threatened to not allow them
[4434.60 --> 4437.22]  to produce any any android devices if
[4437.22 --> 4439.44]  they didn't stop doing their own their
[4439.44 --> 4441.14]  own branched version of android i mean
[4441.14 --> 4442.88]  even for someone the size of amazon
[4442.88 --> 4445.40]  maintaining kindle is really really
[4445.40 --> 4446.66]  difficult becoming more and more
[4446.66 --> 4448.88]  difficult and so you run into problems
[4448.88 --> 4451.16]  like with sanogen mod where they can't
[4451.16 --> 4453.56]  actually include g apps the google apps
[4453.56 --> 4455.76]  you have to install sanogen and then go
[4455.76 --> 4457.52]  install gs because they won't allow
[4457.52 --> 4459.28]  them to bundle them luckily it's fairly
[4459.28 --> 4462.20]  easy in that case but companies are
[4462.20 --> 4463.62]  getting kind of scared because this is
[4463.62 --> 4465.06]  really aggressive there's a serious
[4465.06 --> 4467.10]  walled garden going off with google oh
[4467.10 --> 4468.14]  yeah this is something we haven't
[4468.14 --> 4469.62]  mentioned yet so you guys should read
[4469.62 --> 4471.38]  this article it's fantastic it's on
[4471.38 --> 4472.92]  ars technica it'll be linked in the in
[4472.92 --> 4476.06]  the doc but okay not only can you not
[4476.06 --> 4479.74]  produce for yourself but if you um so
[4479.74 --> 4481.90]  someone like someone like amazon they
[4481.90 --> 4484.66]  can't even get an android
[4484.66 --> 4489.40]  an open handset alliance member to
[4489.40 --> 4491.80]  manufacture kindle fire for them they
[4491.80 --> 4493.60]  have to get someone who's not a member
[4493.60 --> 4494.68]  of the alliance to do it so
[4494.68 --> 4497.68]  automatically most of the major oem so
[4497.68 --> 4503.08]  that's foxconn asus acer htc lenovo
[4503.08 --> 4505.24]  all these guys are completely off the
[4505.24 --> 4506.80]  list and they have to use much smaller
[4506.80 --> 4508.30]  manufacturers who are not members of
[4508.30 --> 4511.54]  this of this secret handshake club that
[4511.54 --> 4513.70]  google is locking into their way of
[4513.70 --> 4516.10]  doing things and then not allowing them
[4516.10 --> 4518.56]  to even facilitate anyone else to have
[4518.56 --> 4521.80]  a different branching version of android
[4521.80 --> 4523.84]  so getting into the club as he was just
[4523.84 --> 4525.76]  saying is difficult and shady and a lot
[4525.76 --> 4526.96]  of its behind doors and it's not
[4526.96 --> 4528.70]  entirely known how it happens and then
[4528.70 --> 4530.80]  getting out is kind of the same way and
[4530.80 --> 4532.90]  when you're in there it's nice because
[4532.90 --> 4534.34]  you get access to all the google apps
[4534.34 --> 4536.38]  and everything but then it's also kind
[4536.38 --> 4538.78]  of scary because you don't know what can
[4538.78 --> 4540.98]  happen next so a few people within the
[4540.98 --> 4544.18]  closed garden like samsung are trying to
[4544.18 --> 4546.04]  develop their own alternate apps and you
[4546.04 --> 4547.48]  might be wondering why is there all this
[4547.48 --> 4549.88]  bloatware on certain say sams as much as we
[4549.88 --> 4553.78]  complain about samsung's equivalents so here here we go there's actually a great graphic showing all the equivalents chrome and internet play store and samsung apps calendar and calendar and calendar play games and games are we seeing a pattern here is samsung hedging their bets
[4553.78 --> 4581.18]  basically samsung is developing all this stuff that people might not even be using so they can get user feedback and make sure that it works on all their devices so that if something drastic goes wrong they can bail and still be okay and still have all these applications because aosp
[4581.18 --> 4611.16]  because aosp kind of styled applications have been basically abandoned in terms of development if they didn't have this stuff ready if they lost the ability to use google apps they would be losing everything that makes the device awesome because well okay and the user usability side not necessarily performance but that's brutal and this is not something that we're used to from well it's been going on for a little while now but it's still not something that you would have as a characteristic for google in the past because how they got to the
[4611.18 --> 4634.18]  top was embracing change and embracing user feedback and user contribution and now that they're up there they have like 80% market share or something they're like nope walls up no one can touch our stuff it's all closed back off and it's interesting because we've seen other companies kind of do this and it doesn't even actually always turn out that great but if anyone can do it it's probably going to be google
[4634.18 --> 4656.58]  so i don't know i mean um it's funny because google built this os on the openness of it and the crusaders that crusaded for well hey you know we want to support this initiative versus apple's approach which is completely walled garden are they really that different anymore
[4656.58 --> 4667.02]  no not really to be honest um it's it's it's gonna be interesting leading into stuff like cyanogen mod where they're gonna become their own full company now they're gonna rename they're gonna be their own os
[4667.02 --> 4680.52]  or is is this type of people gonna take the core of android and just abandon and then just have have all their own new apps like samsung is preparing to do but not actually doing like i don't i don't know it's interesting i google
[4680.52 --> 4708.74]  i used to love you man like what's going on yeah i mean even things like like the the whole thing that's been going on with google and microsoft over the youtube app that is another great example of how google's going beyond not you know building an app for a competing platform but hindering microsoft from creating a youtube player for their platform at every turn and just generally being buttheads about it
[4708.74 --> 4714.32]  um to the point where even the google fans are for the most part kind of looking at this going
[4714.32 --> 4720.16]  i'm a google fan i'm still going for android my next phone will probably still be android like 99 sure
[4720.16 --> 4727.92]  i'm still not happy that's crazy i'm not not so into it i'm totally into open source i'm totally into
[4727.92 --> 4737.64]  freeing up development and that's you know what if they started off this way that would be cool but they kind of got everyone onto the boat and then once everyone was on the boat they locked all the doors and they're like nope
[4737.64 --> 4745.56]  nope nope nope can't do anything you're screwed you're stuck which is which is not cool and and it makes so much more sense now
[4745.56 --> 4752.68]  yeah because like you and i i remember talking i don't remember what phone we saw but someone at the at the uh
[4752.68 --> 4760.24]  tech fair showed us a phone i don't remember what phone that was but we were kind of laughing because that was the first time we had played with a few of the new samsung apps
[4760.24 --> 4765.62]  yeah we're like why the heck does this crap exist like this is so stupid like there's so much better
[4765.62 --> 4770.64]  stuff and then it makes so much more sense now samsung probably knew they're in this walled garden
[4770.64 --> 4774.34]  they know the stuff that's going on yeah they're smart they're a smart company they probably saw this
[4774.34 --> 4780.56]  coming and they're preparing um and they're probably one of the few fish that google might have trouble
[4780.56 --> 4786.24]  pushing around yeah i would i would certainly think so i mean if samsung all of a sudden decided okay well
[4786.24 --> 4791.12]  no we're gonna go we're gonna go windows phone and we're gonna put the same kind of i mean samsung
[4791.12 --> 4795.78]  does a lot of r d yep not only on the hardware side but also on the software side they went if they
[4795.78 --> 4800.28]  suddenly went look we're gonna cooperate with microsoft to the same extent that we've cooperated
[4800.28 --> 4806.98]  with you and we've helped build android android was a a tiny blip on the radar until samsung really
[4806.98 --> 4812.54]  threw their hat into the ring and that was when android took off there's no denying it you can't just
[4812.54 --> 4818.90]  well htc was doing great yeah in in the context of how large the android market was at the time
[4818.90 --> 4828.14]  htc was doing great yeah in the context of what android is now htc is a drop in in a you know an
[4828.14 --> 4835.86]  ocean um speaking of which lumia sales so uh so okay so speaking of which htc in spite of the one being
[4835.86 --> 4845.10]  fantastic is uh seeing a little bit of a decline in market share so the ray william rd robert downey
[4845.10 --> 4851.32]  jr campaign uh doesn't seem to be doing that much um have we reached the point where from a hardware
[4851.32 --> 4858.88]  perspective phones have become so commodity that you have to approach them a completely different way
[4858.88 --> 4864.48]  samsung has just a billion and one different models so there's something to buy for every price point and
[4864.48 --> 4869.82]  they have that trusted name apple's resorted to like colors again they've never done that with
[4869.82 --> 4873.98]  iphone yeah but then there's also other problems that are going to be further on in this document
[4873.98 --> 4877.90]  with like their screen having issues and stuff just yeah we're moving on to that next we're moving on
[4877.90 --> 4881.54]  to that next nokia is doing the same thing it's like look we're going to have colors we're going to
[4881.54 --> 4889.06]  have 43 megapixels have have we just gotten to the point where it's it's just getting impossible
[4889.06 --> 4893.22]  to differentiate in the phone market anymore they all run basically the same hardware now yeah the
[4893.22 --> 4897.74]  internal hardware is so freaking similar that's that's my biggest problem with the phone market
[4897.74 --> 4903.00]  is people will debate different things so much and argue so much and i'm like well these four
[4903.00 --> 4908.54]  phones are identical so and it's not changing that fast anymore no i mean it's not like there's
[4908.54 --> 4914.22]  something that has dramatically leapfrogged htc1 in terms of performance it's still a top tier phone
[4914.22 --> 4919.02]  but for whatever reason no one's really talking about it i still like it actually i'm finally getting
[4919.02 --> 4923.72]  an lte compatible version i don't know if i told you that yep so i'm super super stoked on that one
[4923.72 --> 4928.34]  thing that i've noticed with the phone market is they basically did what like mainly graphics cards
[4928.34 --> 4934.50]  and cpus but what the computer market did but instead the computer market did it kind of slowly
[4934.50 --> 4940.68]  right we're kind of coming on the downturn now the phone market was like boop yeah like they're
[4940.68 --> 4946.28]  already done the huge hill that was there so so strongly for a few years and now it's just like oh yeah
[4946.28 --> 4951.90]  we're just releasing derivatives of the same products basically it's interesting um okay so
[4951.90 --> 4958.20]  before we move into our next topic which is going to be g-sync and mantle so so my main thoughts on
[4958.20 --> 4964.78]  these two technologies i would like to give you guys a word from our sponsors so our first sponsor
[4964.78 --> 4971.22]  is squarespace.com so squarespace is the easy way to create a beautiful functional website for your blog
[4971.22 --> 4977.56]  organization or just for a web store or whatever else they have a ton of different tools and they're
[4977.56 --> 4983.56]  phenomenally easy to use compared to a lot of other things in fact we went from a wordpress site for
[4983.56 --> 4990.78]  linusmediagroup.com to a squarespace site and it has proven itself to be robust easy to maintain
[4990.78 --> 4997.30]  easy to use and very very inexpensive so it only costs i think i can't even remember i feel bad now but
[4997.30 --> 5002.94]  i think it's like 13 a month or something like that for a basic squarespace subscription and if
[5002.94 --> 5007.44]  you buy a whole year at a time they will actually throw in a domain name for you for the first year
[5007.44 --> 5013.88]  for free you can also visit squarespace.com slash linus for a free trial and you can get 10 off if you
[5013.88 --> 5020.42]  use offer code linus10 so that's for october for this month although i'm sure if you next month flipped
[5020.42 --> 5025.66]  it over and used linus11 or whatever i'm pretty sure that would work too because we've got an ongoing
[5025.66 --> 5030.50]  thing with squarespace we're really happy with the way that they support the customers that we've
[5030.50 --> 5034.62]  directed to them we haven't had any complaints about them which is a solid indicator for us and
[5034.62 --> 5038.96]  we use the service ourselves we've even tried stress testing it like sending everyone watching
[5038.96 --> 5044.16]  the live stream to linusmediagroup.com to see if that takes it down and while we've taken down
[5044.16 --> 5050.84]  manufacturer websites and blogs and stuff like that many times many times our own site doesn't go down
[5050.84 --> 5055.48]  even if we hit it really really hard so it's not perfect for everyone like it's not really great
[5055.48 --> 5061.70]  for running a forum so linus tech tips.com is still our own creation it does have 24 7 tech support and
[5061.70 --> 5067.68]  you can tinker around a fair bit with the css and html if you do want to customize things so there you go
[5067.68 --> 5073.26]  sponsor number one thank you squarespace for sponsoring the wan show and our second sponsor
[5073.26 --> 5080.40]  hotspot shield so bit.ly slash hs share these guys we actually did have one complaint on the forum
[5080.40 --> 5086.08]  but i was super impressed because what they did is they actually sent a representative over they had
[5086.08 --> 5090.66]  a post on that thread within i think it was about a day it was pretty quick it was pretty quick with
[5090.66 --> 5096.76]  a phone number and an email address and okay i think i got the phone number to give to the guy in case he
[5096.76 --> 5100.64]  needed it and then he didn't end up needing it but they got an email address to someone they could email
[5100.64 --> 5107.02]  directly a person not like customer service at hotspot shield.com and the thing got taken care of and i was
[5107.02 --> 5111.98]  really impressed by that and they've committed to me that they're going to make sure that our our peeps
[5111.98 --> 5116.66]  get supported so that's really cool so hotspot shield is a vpn solution it works on your desktop
[5116.66 --> 5121.86]  your laptop your phone whatever platform you might want to use and what vpns do is a number of things
[5121.86 --> 5127.06]  so number one is they make your privacy a little bit easier to maintain online by obscuring your ip address
[5127.06 --> 5131.72]  your ip address can be used to find out all kinds of cool stuff about you including your location to
[5131.72 --> 5136.64]  within about a city block in many cases so that's one thing it does number two is it allows you to
[5136.64 --> 5141.24]  circumvent geographical restrictions so if you want american netflix and you happen to live in india
[5141.24 --> 5148.22]  then a vpn is a fantastic way to do that because it will show netflix a us ip but you will actually
[5148.22 --> 5153.16]  be behind that ip getting the data just passed through to you it does slow down your connection
[5153.16 --> 5158.34]  because there is a pass through but between those two features if you're not already sold the last one
[5158.34 --> 5166.08]  is of course the ability to um get past things like firewalls or or blackouts in particular regions so
[5166.08 --> 5172.18]  you can access content and sites that are otherwise not available in your area so that's uh that's
[5172.18 --> 5177.06]  another really good thing about it as well so again bit.ly slash hs share and you can get 20%
[5177.06 --> 5183.04]  off elite prices using the code linus so and there's a there's a free trial of elite as well i should
[5183.04 --> 5188.64]  have mentioned that too all right just before we jump into the new topic oh okay all right so you're not
[5188.64 --> 5193.04]  ready for me to just basically go off the wall about this for a while very soon this will not take
[5193.04 --> 5199.22]  that long um one thing that i want to tell everyone about oh yeah right is actually it's kind of in a
[5199.22 --> 5203.18]  beta right now we actually already have changes that we're going to be pushing to it just we're
[5203.18 --> 5208.88]  going to try and do large incremental changes instead of changing it every single day um but
[5208.88 --> 5213.08]  what you can do now is if you go on the forum scroll all the way down to the bottom and click
[5213.08 --> 5218.26]  the change theme button there's now a date a day theme selection so what we're going to try and do
[5218.26 --> 5221.94]  right now is just kind of touch up the day theme we have a few different things we want to fix on it
[5221.94 --> 5226.82]  and it re-skins the forum to actually look more like a linus tech tips thing than a default thing
[5226.82 --> 5232.32]  we will always have the default theme available so don't worry about it if you don't ask an asterisk
[5232.32 --> 5237.44]  i mean always is a strong word but yeah unless like we don't plan to remove it we're not going
[5237.44 --> 5240.48]  to go out of our way to remove it if something happens and we have to remove it or something like
[5240.48 --> 5245.10]  that sure but we're not going to go out of our way to remove it um so for now if you want to try
[5245.10 --> 5250.00]  the more like black gray and orange styled theme which honestly looks a lot more linus tech tipsy
[5250.00 --> 5254.38]  to me uh you can go ahead and try that out like i said there's going to be patches so a few minor
[5254.38 --> 5258.44]  things will change not really the color schemes or anything like that but certain icons like the
[5258.44 --> 5263.56]  forum red icons which are still default and stuff like that that'll that'll change so yeah all right
[5263.56 --> 5270.52]  guys so here we go this link is actually from linus tech tips.com and there's a thread on the forum
[5270.52 --> 5278.40]  called amd's mantle versus g-sync i typed up a wall of text which you can see over there about the
[5278.40 --> 5284.58]  pros and cons that i feel exist for both of them so let's start with project mantle i think i don't
[5284.58 --> 5289.22]  think they actually call it project mantle i don't care i'm calling it project mantle because in my
[5289.22 --> 5296.36]  mind mantle is a project it's not done we haven't seen it yet that's the issue with mantle there's a
[5296.36 --> 5301.92]  whole lot of fanboy jibber jabber going back and forth about how great mantle is going to be how
[5301.92 --> 5309.08]  irrelevant it's going to be and the truth of the matter is nobody knows i talked again so i was
[5309.08 --> 5316.38]  talking to dice's uh technical development whatever his title is big deal big deal okay big deal on
[5316.38 --> 5322.08]  frostbite engine i said what's performance going to be like with mantle versus not mantle and he says
[5322.08 --> 5331.12]  we're not sure yet doesn't know i mean it's it's october the patch is coming in december that should
[5331.12 --> 5338.24]  give you guys some idea how not not we don't know yet now the theory is it's going to be awesome
[5338.24 --> 5343.82]  i personally think we're going to see dramatic huge performance improvements i would be very surprised
[5343.82 --> 5348.72]  if we don't see performance improvements deep into the double digits just from looking at some of the
[5348.72 --> 5354.74]  ways that it is going to remove existing bottlenecks but a really good point again that was made to me
[5354.74 --> 5358.46]  was well a lot of the time you remove one bottleneck and find another one
[5358.46 --> 5364.84]  yeah you remove this bottleneck only to discover that there was another slightly bigger bottleneck
[5364.84 --> 5369.66]  like just just somewhere else and then there's you go and you got to go and fix that too so we
[5369.66 --> 5374.44]  might not even see even if we see small improvements with mantle we might not even see huge improvements
[5374.44 --> 5382.46]  until other tweaks are made the other thing is support until amd does their developer conference which
[5382.46 --> 5387.98]  is coming in november we know nothing about what's even going to support mantle i don't think even
[5387.98 --> 5392.88]  nvidia knows much about which projects are gonna which which upcoming games are going to support mantle
[5392.88 --> 5398.06]  amd kept this thing pretty well under wraps we know like we know like battlefield 4 and a lot of people
[5398.06 --> 5403.32]  can make assumptions that probably star citizen will and if star citizen does then maybe cry engine
[5403.32 --> 5409.60]  like like there's a few things but this is all speculation at this point we don't know so that's
[5409.60 --> 5416.40]  what i have to say about mantle would i be making a buying decision would i be dropping money on something
[5416.40 --> 5420.62]  on the basis of mantle the answer is no i think a good point you made was about indie devs
[5420.62 --> 5426.08]  indie's huge right now yeah massive like absolutely like temple of doom huge
[5426.08 --> 5435.82]  and so if it does i mean it does add a significant amount of development time to your game
[5435.82 --> 5441.44]  to implement something like mantle so unless we see something like uh what was your scenario i i did a
[5441.44 --> 5445.30]  little bit more research on i don't think it's gonna be possible okay i don't know but if they have
[5445.30 --> 5451.04]  some way that can help people translate code into mantle or something like that that would make a lot of
[5451.04 --> 5457.50]  sense but it's it's not easy that was for which engine was it uh my theory which is not gonna work
[5457.50 --> 5464.42]  was based on the unity engine um but so for an indie dev think about this an indie dev goes in
[5464.42 --> 5469.44]  they have no real backing it's a bunch of dudes living in the one guy's basement whose mom doesn't
[5469.44 --> 5473.66]  mind them staying there while all the other ones want them to get out of their house and decide to
[5473.66 --> 5477.54]  make this awesome game which ends up making them a ton of money but they don't have a ton of money at
[5477.54 --> 5482.18]  the time and they need to push it out on some platform they're picking phone they're trying to
[5482.18 --> 5487.14]  pick windows they're trying to pick console they're picking one yeah they're they're probably not going
[5487.14 --> 5493.26]  to go with mantle because that's slightly less than half of one platform and there's a lot of
[5493.26 --> 5499.98]  misunderstandings about mantle coding for mantle is not the same as xbox one no there are going to be
[5499.98 --> 5507.44]  some similarities there will be some principles that developers when they are learning how to code for ps4 and
[5507.44 --> 5512.26]  xbox one and even wii u to a certain extent that they will then be able to apply to a mantle
[5512.26 --> 5518.04]  implementation on the pc but it's not the same thing it's not like oh every platform uses mantle no no
[5518.04 --> 5524.92]  no that's not how it works every platform um from the from the next gen consoles and upcoming pcs and
[5524.92 --> 5531.74]  then the last gen of amd graphics cards uses gcn which is a particular architecture for amd's
[5531.74 --> 5538.70]  microprocessor it is not it is not a software way of that hardware interacting with a game engine
[5538.70 --> 5546.02]  so mantle is pc but the principles may be applicable from other platforms that's all they're really saying
[5546.02 --> 5551.96]  and translating from a system that has mantle on it to a system that has mantle on it is supposed to be
[5551.96 --> 5560.46]  really easy but translating from non-mantle to mantle is not going to be easy all right so that's what we
[5560.46 --> 5566.20]  have to say about that i am i'm sitting here bated breath waiting for the november developer conference
[5566.20 --> 5572.86]  and we are going to be running battlefield 4 through its paces as soon as that mantle patch drops
[5572.86 --> 5578.20]  trust me that will happen we're extremely excited i mean one of the things that i have heard already
[5578.20 --> 5584.10]  is that even though uh battlefield 4 already makes excellent use of multiple cpu cores we may see even
[5584.10 --> 5590.26]  dramatic improvements again for those as well with mantle so so we'll have the launch benchmarks for
[5590.26 --> 5594.72]  battlefield 4 because everyone's going to want that and then well all the battlefield games we go
[5594.72 --> 5598.80]  pretty over the top so we'll have the launch one and we'll have a future one as well but i but but
[5598.80 --> 5605.36]  it's all uncertain now okay so moving on to g-sync everyone's okay not everyone some people seem to get it
[5605.36 --> 5611.56]  but a lot of people's perception of g-sync is wrong i saw a lot of posts in that thread that made me feel
[5611.56 --> 5618.12]  like i needed to write this wall of text this one right here because the perception of g-sync is wrong for
[5618.12 --> 5624.86]  the most part out there g-sync is amazing it is a game changer it is not open for debate allowing the
[5624.86 --> 5633.26]  graphics card to push instructions to the monitor to refresh does not increase latency it does not work
[5633.26 --> 5641.34]  that way it improves latency so people saying oh well then my monitor refresh rate will be less
[5641.34 --> 5648.08]  because my graph because it will run at 50 hertz instead of 60 hertz which it would if my graphics
[5648.08 --> 5655.90]  card dips to 50 fps right but your graphics card was only outputting 50 fps so instead of a of a crappy
[5655.90 --> 5662.44]  tearing leggy mess or or implementing g-sync which is going to take your frame rate all the way from 60
[5662.44 --> 5667.98]  to 50 or if you're running a 120 hertz panel it'll take it from 120 down to 60 down to 30 depending on how
[5667.98 --> 5675.12]  performance takes a dive um we will be getting a frame update to the screen in as timely a manner as
[5675.12 --> 5679.72]  possible as opposed to getting some of one frame and some of the next one and having tearing and it
[5679.72 --> 5688.44]  basically looking horrible this is huge it is awesome and it is it is it is not it is not something that
[5688.44 --> 5694.88]  there is any conversation to be had about now there are some issues number one hardware support kepler
[5694.88 --> 5700.04]  only i recently had to upgrade my graphics card in fact my computer sitting downstairs in the middle
[5700.04 --> 5705.08]  of a graphics card upgrade much to my dismay because i was running a gtx 590 thinking that was
[5705.08 --> 5709.50]  going to last me for an awful long time given i'm not that demanding anymore i thought at least until
[5709.50 --> 5716.20]  star citizen anyway um it only so it's only supported by kepler so you will need a graphics card upgrade if
[5716.20 --> 5721.68]  you're not running gtx 600 series and higher number two is monitors now we've already started to see some
[5721.68 --> 5727.40]  pricing come through it looks like asus's monitor was projected to be around 399 which for a gaming
[5727.40 --> 5734.90]  grade monitor i guess isn't that bad although i still don't know how i feel about gaming grade
[5734.90 --> 5740.42]  monitors for the most part because high refresh rate monitors t with tn panels we have an exception
[5740.42 --> 5747.76]  i think we both agree the xl2420 te is not a bad one it's not great i would you buy one
[5747.76 --> 5753.18]  personally yeah just say no that's fine i know that i know what you're gonna say no but i have
[5753.18 --> 5757.72]  suggested it to people okay and they are happy with it and i wouldn't buy one but i've suggested
[5757.72 --> 5762.96]  it to people and my recent video about it was a very strong recommendation if you want a high
[5762.96 --> 5768.44]  refresh rate panel this is the one that we've seen so far that that you know thumbs up okay
[5768.44 --> 5775.74]  right now with the way that g-sync is positioned as a gaming technology only i think those are the only
[5775.74 --> 5781.06]  monitors we're going to see it implemented with right off the bat with that said and so that's
[5781.06 --> 5788.44]  at four hundred dollars pricing will come down the g-sync hardware unit is not only just for g-sync
[5788.44 --> 5794.62]  it also replaces the scaler that is built into the monitor so nvidia knows a thing or two about scaling
[5794.62 --> 5799.80]  and a thing or two about processing images so they actually went okay well look we'll give you a piece
[5799.80 --> 5806.32]  of hardware that does something that you already had to buy hardware to support and also is compatible
[5806.32 --> 5810.36]  with g-sync we just want you to pay our licensing fee which they have claimed is pretty reasonable
[5810.36 --> 5817.38]  so if that's the case i believe and i hope that we will see monitors that aren't just tn panels and
[5817.38 --> 5823.30]  aren't necessarily just high refresh rate monitors so maybe we'll see um you know 60 hertz 2560 by 1440
[5823.30 --> 5829.60]  monitors or even 4k monitors or tvs supporting this g-sync standard and it will be a new
[5829.60 --> 5836.04]  golden age for gaming they had a 4k tv it was like an 85 inch tv or something ridiculous like that
[5836.04 --> 5841.50]  running at the nvidia conference and i kind of looked at it and i went you know uh if i were to
[5841.50 --> 5847.90]  take screen grabs of this great i wouldn't play a game on this no it looks terrible it looks terrible
[5847.90 --> 5854.06]  with all the tearing and all the visual artifacts that exist because of that desynchronization between
[5854.06 --> 5861.32]  the output fps and the input and then output refresh rate on the monitor that exists so
[5861.32 --> 5866.96]  will g-sync run on amd is a question i've seen a lot what nvidia said during the conference is we
[5866.96 --> 5873.50]  haven't precluded so that is to say they haven't decided not to allow amd or intel to license the
[5873.50 --> 5879.30]  technology i hope they do and i hope amd swallows whatever pride they may have and whatever issues
[5879.30 --> 5884.60]  they might have about working with nvidia and i hope we see g-sync on both sides because
[5884.60 --> 5892.34]  take take this for what it is i will not consider gaming without g-sync once monitor availability
[5892.34 --> 5899.04]  becomes widespread it's we need like i think this might have even been in the dock like i need like
[5899.04 --> 5904.80]  a pro art level monitor yes i want a proper monitor that would be awesome with like a gorgeous
[5904.80 --> 5909.18]  ips panel you know give me give me a 10-bit panel i mean we're seeing nvidia hardware on the monitor
[5909.18 --> 5914.56]  now we might even be looking at lower response times lower input lag i don't know this is a this
[5914.56 --> 5921.44]  is a guess but nvidia cares about low latency in a way that i really feel like the commodity monitor
[5921.44 --> 5928.12]  makers do not well younger me would have gone for that that benq super fast monitor um but now that
[5928.12 --> 5931.68]  i'm not like trying to play competitively on all that kind of stuff i'm playing more for the experience
[5931.68 --> 5936.02]  of games even if i'm playing multiplayer doesn't color make a difference it does you can totally
[5936.02 --> 5943.24]  tell and like that that pa 279q that monitor oh man we have a we have a video editing build guide
[5943.24 --> 5950.14]  coming out guys that we use the pa 279q monitor this is a 10-bit panel so that's full deep color
[5950.14 --> 5957.08]  support with a 12-bit lookup table and even when you're not running 10-bit it has it comes pre-calibrated
[5957.08 --> 5963.48]  with delta e of less than 0.5 the colors are basically perfect to the eye for people that
[5963.48 --> 5969.60]  don't understand like i i went from my really high-end pa panels yeah to that and they like
[5969.60 --> 5975.36]  if i put that beside my pa panel would put it to shame just makes it look stupid oh like oh speaking
[5975.36 --> 5983.76]  of which edsel says i can have it if hold on if i get him a matching 1920 by 1200 monitor for his
[5983.76 --> 5988.96]  because he'd rather have two monitors that are the same rest than have mismatched ones and i asked
[5988.96 --> 5995.14]  him does it have to be color accurate he says no so the benq on my desk at home is going on edsel's
[5995.14 --> 6000.08]  workstation that's what does he realize what he's doing yeah yeah yeah he was like no it doesn't
[6000.08 --> 6004.46]  have to be cut he would rather have two same resolution editor doesn't care if it's color
[6004.46 --> 6010.14]  accurate and and you heard me talking to brendan he'd rather have the high-end geforce card with more
[6010.14 --> 6014.68]  cuda course than the quadro so he wouldn't be able to use a higher than six-bit panel anyway you
[6014.68 --> 6019.00]  didn't tell him he could use that panel you told me he specifically could not well he already has a
[6019.00 --> 6023.00]  pa and you know he's not he's not getting that one it was between me and edsel which is ridiculous
[6023.00 --> 6028.52]  you should not have that screen if you know it oh i'm so dumb he's gonna open spreadsheets on this
[6028.52 --> 6033.48]  screen and they will look fantastic ridiculous he's gonna put a quadro in his computer and use that
[6033.48 --> 6038.32]  monitor open spreadsheets and it hurts my brain oh it's gonna i told him it shouldn't go to him
[6038.32 --> 6043.72]  should i water cool the quadro i bet i could it's just a 470 it's not gonna overheat it does
[6043.72 --> 6049.68]  nothing but all that's gonna do is run your ui it's loud it's single slot it's loud stupid your
[6049.68 --> 6053.66]  computer turns off when you hit your table anyway and i'm gonna be doing most of my gaming streaming
[6053.66 --> 6059.16]  to shield anyway oh my god oh you're gonna put it in your personal ring yeah so it's not even gonna
[6059.16 --> 6066.10]  be used for work at all no no not at all sweet awesome right now his work computer if he hits the
[6066.10 --> 6071.80]  table just completely shuts off but nope he's gonna take this awesome hardware home
[6071.80 --> 6081.32]  along with your two shields i'm a terrible person i'm sorry jerk jeez anyways um so speaking of shield
[6081.32 --> 6087.78]  i mean fps okay you know what let's talk let's talk 290x i want to hear your thoughts first and i want
[6087.78 --> 6092.78]  to hear overclocked and non-overclocked thoughts let's get while we're talking about this let's get
[6092.78 --> 6098.26]  twitter rolling about 290x yeah we can do a twitter we want to hear you guys okay hit them with
[6098.26 --> 6103.74]  something um and move over the spacing's weird i'll scooch over here what do you want me to what do
[6103.74 --> 6107.62]  you mean hit them with something just get close you said hit them with hit them with a question
[6107.62 --> 6112.66]  okay 290x what are your thoughts of what what questions do you have for me i benched it what
[6112.66 --> 6118.18]  questions do you mark do you have for linus he researched the 80 trillion page document that comes
[6118.18 --> 6122.88]  with it um which i skimmed through but i think he read it and between all the other decks is like
[6122.88 --> 6127.58]  there's a lot of other decks yeah yeah there's a lot of information about it what questions do you
[6127.58 --> 6132.84]  have for us about it because honestly when i was reading the comments below the video of which there
[6132.84 --> 6137.96]  are many they're like people either straight up muted the video once i came on and then just decided
[6137.96 --> 6143.44]  to talk about the charts which is ridiculous or like muted the video while linus was talking because
[6143.44 --> 6148.66]  we both said it like and there's people just saying stuff in the comments that are completely
[6148.66 --> 6155.32]  wrong and clarified in the video by both of us so i don't like i'm sure there's questions out there
[6155.32 --> 6161.46]  so go ahead and ask um all right so i'm going to kick this off i was asked on hardware canucks's
[6161.46 --> 6166.34]  weekly show i don't know if you know i did a guest bot uh we recorded it yesterday to sum up
[6166.34 --> 6173.40]  radeon r9 290x in one word and i used the word competitive um can do you have a better word
[6173.40 --> 6182.34]  no um no that's a pretty good word we've taken some flack for the fact that the 290x loses in
[6182.34 --> 6190.92]  our benchmarks at both 1080p and 1440p now let me let me say this though 290x is competitive the kinds
[6190.92 --> 6196.52]  of margins of of loss and win that we're looking at in our testing are the kinds of things that you
[6196.52 --> 6201.62]  would need to run fraps to notice for the most part there were some exceptions where minimum frame rates
[6201.62 --> 6207.04]  were quite a bit lower on 290x but in one game we might be able to chalk that up to early drivers
[6207.04 --> 6211.60]  because trust me they're early oh yeah they're very early and what we saw with never settle was
[6211.60 --> 6216.56]  amd has been able to do some serious driver tweaking i mean they probably have a significant chunk of
[6216.56 --> 6221.10]  their driver team working just on fixing the frame pacing issue right now oh yeah they're back to
[6221.10 --> 6226.56]  having everybody focused on game tweaks we could be looking at a very different story for 290x
[6226.56 --> 6232.20]  so we aren't down on 290x i want to be clear about that this is a return to competition
[6232.20 --> 6238.68]  and look at that pricing the pricing's amazing and even quoted in the video by me which i don't
[6238.68 --> 6245.20]  understand how people didn't hear i ran it at stock against the 780 in a bunch of the same games
[6245.20 --> 6251.12]  and it won but we don't report those numbers we report overclocked numbers that's why they're
[6251.12 --> 6256.72]  different and for people saying well you guys should report non-overclocked numbers why there's
[6256.72 --> 6262.92]  literally there were 104 journalists at the hawaii event alone and i know most of them probably each
[6262.92 --> 6270.38]  and every one of them got a 290x to do a review of them at least 103 of them ran the cards at stock
[6270.38 --> 6275.52]  okay we run our cards overclocked so we're doing something that's at least a little bit different
[6275.52 --> 6280.88]  so you can see the different perspective and for everyone running around saying oh well they're
[6280.88 --> 6286.76]  clearly paid off by nvidia nvidia doesn't give us any money they give us graphics cards so does amd
[6286.76 --> 6295.38]  so by that logic we're paid off by both of them i guess um what are you even talking about and and i
[6295.38 --> 6301.96]  even posted this in the thread about how i'm biased um i i should see if i can dig that up because it's a
[6301.96 --> 6309.28]  it's a fantastic thread um we were doing game roundups like game showdowns for for months actually
[6309.28 --> 6312.70]  we need to get back to doing those but it's been a bit of a we've got star system coming out we've
[6312.70 --> 6316.94]  got we've got some battlefield 4 coming out it's been a bit of a barren wasteland in terms of games
[6316.94 --> 6323.16]  releases for a while but amd won almost every one of them and we took so much flack for running
[6323.16 --> 6329.56]  overclocked settings because our amd cards overclocked really well and like exceptionally well 7000 series
[6329.56 --> 6333.72]  overclocked incredible you take all the sliders and put them at the end it was a really good overclocker
[6333.72 --> 6337.62]  and now the same guys are pissed that we're running overclocked settings because it doesn't
[6337.62 --> 6344.60]  overclocked that well what do you want we run overclocked settings for better or for worse
[6344.60 --> 6350.82]  our 290x wasn't a great overclocker our 780x is a decent overclocker but it's not a golden sample by
[6350.82 --> 6357.60]  any stretch look in about six weeks there's going to be non-reference cards i am already in the queue
[6357.60 --> 6363.62]  for an asus non-reference card i expect that one with a better power design and a better cooler
[6363.62 --> 6370.24]  to kick some serious ass i have also contacted coolants already about getting a 290x water block
[6370.24 --> 6374.92]  as well as an external water cooling unit and some quick disconnects like we discussed and we are
[6374.92 --> 6380.48]  going to take gtx 780 and radeon 290x we are going to overclock them to the max and we are going to remove
[6380.48 --> 6387.08]  thermals as an obstacle because that is the issue with reference 290x cards the cooler's not great
[6387.08 --> 6392.24]  the chip runs hot fine let's water block them then we'll see who comes out on top and there will
[6392.24 --> 6396.08]  be no questioning the numbers at that point i'm very excited to bring you guys those numbers and
[6396.08 --> 6400.52]  people that were pissed about the current video the problem is it almost maxes out its temps at stock
[6400.52 --> 6405.92]  so when you overclock it there's not much room and the thing that's throttling it is temps you can't
[6405.92 --> 6410.78]  go above 95 degrees and that would be the same way as gpu boost 2.0 where once you reach a threshold
[6410.78 --> 6416.82]  for power temperatures maximum voltage or maximum clocks as you have them set it stops
[6416.82 --> 6424.00]  turning up starts throttling back so i sorry i could clock up and i was clocked up at one point
[6424.00 --> 6428.04]  in time but it wouldn't even run at that speed if i was clocked up above where i ran the current
[6428.04 --> 6432.96]  benchmarks it would throttle down and actually produce worse numbers that's how the new systems
[6432.96 --> 6436.72]  are working so i had to find a happy medium which i did and i reported that in the doc it's not about
[6436.72 --> 6440.50]  turning the dial as high as it goes and you know what it's been like this for a long time even cpu
[6440.50 --> 6445.06]  clocking cpu overclocking memory overclocking when you push it too far you can see performance
[6445.06 --> 6449.50]  degradation it's not just about clock speed and stability test run some benchmarks make sure
[6449.50 --> 6452.40]  you're still getting performance improvements because it doesn't always happen it's about a
[6452.40 --> 6458.88]  balance yes so we just ranted really quickly it might be time for twitter blitz yeah that actually
[6458.88 --> 6464.12]  didn't even take that long um well it's it's not complicated it's a hundred dollars it's a hundred
[6464.12 --> 6469.36]  dollars cheaper and you know what's funny is it's a hundred dollars cheaper because amd knows that's
[6469.36 --> 6475.10]  the right positioning for it whatever amd might say about whatever the press release might say
[6475.10 --> 6480.36]  marketing speak blah blah blah blah with every recent graphics card release probably for the last
[6480.36 --> 6486.80]  couple years the pricing has reflected how the manufacturer knows it is stacked up in the market
[6486.80 --> 6495.36]  780 ti will be positioned such that price performance it'll make sense compared to 290x titan and 780
[6495.36 --> 6501.36]  that is how it will be positioned what i'm interested in is checking out price per performance
[6501.36 --> 6507.44]  ideals with a water block 290x that's gonna be awesome because it's cheaper and water blocks are
[6507.44 --> 6513.32]  expensive yeah and plumbing is expensive but if you add that in it's like you said like a hundred bucks
[6513.32 --> 6519.32]  so if you already have a water loop just adding the block will almost equalize it to a 780 and then
[6519.32 --> 6523.00]  checking out that performance is going to be freaking interesting yeah that's going to be really
[6523.00 --> 6529.64]  interesting so don't worry guys we are not done investigating 290x 780 and for that matter 780 ti
[6529.64 --> 6537.24]  because who knows i have honestly i don't even i don't even know anything yet never mind ndas i haven't
[6537.24 --> 6543.08]  even signed an nda about 780 ti because i don't know anything i don't know it's pink i don't know pricing i
[6543.08 --> 6548.80]  don't know anything for sure so there's rumors but we don't know anything all right and people talking
[6548.80 --> 6557.44]  about the 95 degree thing you know what um it all is it's funny because there's this misconception
[6557.44 --> 6564.72]  i only buy intel cpus because amd runs hot i only run amd cpus because intel runs hot or the same thing
[6564.72 --> 6570.48]  for graphics cards i run nvidia because amd runs hot i run indy because they have all had times in
[6570.48 --> 6580.08]  their history when their chips have run too hot okay so amd um thoroughbred palomino those were hot
[6580.08 --> 6588.08]  running chips okay uh intel prescott man i saw the backs of motherboards that were brown like dark brown
[6588.08 --> 6595.04]  from the power being drawn by the vrms okay prescott run ran hot all right nvidia uh fermi
[6595.04 --> 6600.80]  that wasn't that long ago gtx 480 was a furnace that thing made your room hot it was a space
[6600.80 --> 6606.24]  heater it ran at like 100 degrees seriously i had to have a fan in my window okay amd let's go back we
[6606.24 --> 6611.76]  don't even have to go back very far for them at all 2900 xt comes to mind man did that thing ever run hot
[6611.76 --> 6618.00]  that thing was brutal and that cooler was loud and then now okay r9 290x runs a little bit hot but it's
[6618.00 --> 6623.28]  happened at times and go back and a lot of those products are still working for better or for worse with
[6623.28 --> 6628.80]  the exception of probably prescott man that thing probably burnt out well it was the boards that
[6628.80 --> 6632.56]  were the problem yeah it was drawing too much power and running really hot and the motherboard makers
[6632.56 --> 6637.84]  weren't ready for it whereas the graphics card guys are used to this graphics cards have been running
[6637.84 --> 6643.12]  at 100 degrees for years 8800 gt with that single slot cooler they all ran at 100 degrees there was i
[6643.12 --> 6648.24]  actually got a lot of comments um directly through my live stream last night through my twitter and comments
[6648.24 --> 6652.96]  on that video of people being like slick how scared were you of the 95 degree temperatures because
[6652.96 --> 6657.84]  there's more than one article being like oh my god this thing's 95 degrees i won't even overclock
[6657.84 --> 6663.12]  it at all and it's like dude it it's fine like we've seen this it's designed to run that way it
[6663.12 --> 6670.16]  turns the fan down until it's running at 95 degrees yeah okay that's it's intentional by design if you
[6670.16 --> 6675.52]  don't like it turn it down turn it to 80 80 degrees turn it to 60 degrees and you might because that fan's
[6675.52 --> 6682.00]  insane and you might because okay but turn it down to whatever temperature you want that's the way it works
[6682.00 --> 6686.16]  all right and in saying that i said that before and i got flack for it the like i said the fan
[6686.16 --> 6690.56]  it's really loud it's a really loud everyone says it's loud what do you want us to say because it's
[6690.56 --> 6695.36]  loud just get an aftermarket one like don't worry about it wait for the non-reference card is i think
[6695.36 --> 6700.88]  probably the best advice i can give for 290x right now um unless you really need one immediately
[6700.88 --> 6707.68]  in which case uh we'll sell you ours because we're gonna get some aftermarket ones we're waiting
[6707.68 --> 6712.16]  for dead aftermarket ones yeah unless you want to water cool then you might need a reference card
[6712.16 --> 6717.68]  all right yeah yeah yeah so twitter blitz uh yeah yeah yeah let's do that twitter blitz i had
[6717.68 --> 6722.56]  completely forgotten about that we want to hear your guys's thoughts on 290x now that i've gone on a
[6722.56 --> 6728.24]  tirade for the last however long we might have cleared up everything yeah we might have you know what
[6728.24 --> 6735.92]  feel free to alienware just followed me sweet uh feel free to uh to let us know if what we just
[6735.92 --> 6742.88]  said completely cleared up any of your misconceptions at about 290x all right so do you think personally
[6742.88 --> 6747.20]  that ti will be greater than tightening gaming i think it's possible there's some rumored specs that
[6747.20 --> 6752.64]  it's going to have all of the CUDA cores enabled in which case it might i've had four ssds in six months
[6752.64 --> 6757.12]  as boot drives all die how can that happen heat can be an issue depending on the ssds you're buying
[6757.12 --> 6763.44]  they might not be the highest quality ssds nan flash uh varies dramatically in quality from the best of
[6763.44 --> 6768.00]  the best that guys like intel who actually manufacture the stuff keep for themselves and don't even sell
[6768.00 --> 6773.04]  to anybody samsung does the same bloody thing and all the way down to what you find in commodity flash
[6773.04 --> 6777.36]  drives for three dollars and you can bet that if they put that stuff in an ssd it wouldn't last very
[6777.36 --> 6783.52]  long brands that i'd recommend intel samsung uh crucial people that manufacture their own stuff basically
[6783.52 --> 6788.80]  guys that manufacture their own stuff sand disc is another good one um and oh there's there's one
[6788.80 --> 6793.20]  really important one i know that i'm missing plexster is another really good one all right
[6794.32 --> 6797.52]  what does it feel like to have a boeing for a gpu i don't know i haven't used it yet
[6798.08 --> 6802.48]  unfortunately uh when you test a watercooled 290x will you watercool the 780 we'll try with
[6802.48 --> 6810.56]  them without i think that'll be an interesting scenario 400 for asus g-sync 1080p or 150 1080p and 250
[6810.56 --> 6816.16]  additional gpu budget g-sync seems great but the price premium seems too high good point um
[6816.96 --> 6820.72]  it would be the kind of thing where if you're already buying a decent monitor anyway i would
[6820.72 --> 6827.28]  consider the g-sync option um with that said not having tearing i mean they showed off g-sync not with
[6827.28 --> 6833.20]  titans with 760s that was the point they were trying to make is that look this makes a mid-range
[6833.20 --> 6839.44]  graphics card really able to run higher graphical settings and still feel smooth and still be smooth
[6839.44 --> 6848.24]  all right there you go alienware follows me so we can all see that yay hi alienware if you guys are
[6848.24 --> 6854.24]  watching your computers are kind of plastic i mean i'm not saying they're bad i'm just saying they're
[6854.24 --> 6861.68]  plastic but then but then you always save it i don't say that it's implied no you have okay i said i
[6861.68 --> 6867.04]  don't really like plastic okay alienware if you're listening i'd love to see some more premium like
[6867.04 --> 6871.20]  metal chassis i know it's hard to do with like commodity gaming machines but and they and they
[6871.20 --> 6875.12]  do all their like crazy mechanical movie stuff but yeah they have they do have some cool stuff in their
[6875.12 --> 6878.80]  chassis though have you looked at a recent alienware high-end one like some of the lighting effects
[6878.80 --> 6882.40]  and some of the tool list i know they have in there they've always honestly they've always done pretty
[6882.40 --> 6886.08]  cool things i just haven't really liked the quality of the materials the last time i tried to buy
[6886.08 --> 6890.80]  something from them was when they did the star wars limited edition painted or vinyl wrapped case do you
[6890.80 --> 6897.68]  you remember that yeah i was like i was like please i will pay you double whatever it costs
[6897.68 --> 6904.08]  please they're like nope sorry you gotta buy a system i'm like fine fine seeing how close 780 and titan
[6904.08 --> 6910.48]  are in benchmarks what do you think will happen to titan when 780 comes out good good call um i think
[6910.48 --> 6916.48]  titan was already irrelevant yeah for gaming for gaming because the the driver optimizations for
[6916.48 --> 6921.76]  or 780 have been so much better for gaming um yes and no it's the same gpu i mean i would imagine
[6921.76 --> 6927.04]  they're getting the same performance improvements made differences more on the 780 okay and you're
[6927.04 --> 6931.12]  the one who does the benchmarking so in some interesting situations we haven't been testing titan
[6931.84 --> 6937.20]  that much because we noticed that no one really cared um but i've looked at other people's
[6937.20 --> 6942.24]  benchmarks and i've noticed that in certain weird games 780 will actually come above right which is
[6942.96 --> 6946.16]  weird but i i have to assume it has something to do with driver optimization
[6946.16 --> 6951.12]  titan is what it is it's for cuda programmers um hardcore video editors who want as many cuda cores
[6951.12 --> 6955.04]  as they can possibly stuff in a machine titan has its place but it's for people who don't have a
[6955.04 --> 6961.12]  budget 780 makes a ton more sense unless you're gaming at 4k and you really need that extra frame
[6961.12 --> 6967.44]  buffer all right any interesting android apps you'd recommend also moto x review is happening correct
[6967.44 --> 6972.24]  uh the moto x review is actually mostly shot we're going to finish it up on monday i really liked the moto x
[6972.24 --> 6978.40]  um a lot actually i'm not going to switch to it though so um i guess i i'm still using the
[6978.40 --> 6983.20]  htc one moving forward i actually htc offered to send me finally because they said they were going
[6983.20 --> 6988.88]  to do this right when i got the sample an lte compatible one for for my network and i was like
[6988.88 --> 6993.20]  wait hold on don't send it because i'm using the moto x right now and i really like it and i might
[6993.20 --> 6997.44]  switch so i don't want you guys to like send me some phone that i then don't even use because
[6997.44 --> 7002.72]  part of the advantage for htc is i do genuinely like the phone i can use whatever phone i want
[7002.72 --> 7006.96]  really i can i'm even eligible for an upgrade so if i even wanted an apple phone now i could even go
[7006.96 --> 7012.32]  that route i use it because i love it and i think they've seen sales that have directly come from
[7012.32 --> 7017.12]  me so the last thing i want is for them to invest in sending me a new phone and for me to not even use
[7017.12 --> 7022.00]  it that's just stupid so that was but now i've decided and i definitely am going to stick with the
[7022.00 --> 7026.40]  one good guy linus well i don't want to take stuff from people for no reason that's just stupid
[7026.40 --> 7032.64]  it's definitely cool um there's that question again oh android apps uh check out apollo music
[7032.64 --> 7036.96]  player apollo music player is really good better better quality it's just better it actually works
[7036.96 --> 7041.44]  i like go sms pro a lot that's probably my favorite one um everyone is pissed because they
[7041.44 --> 7046.96]  were expecting it to beat the titan by like 20 fps but it doesn't well you know what how could it
[7046.96 --> 7051.44]  have it has a smaller die area it's built on the same process technology i mean some of the stuff
[7051.44 --> 7057.60]  amd's done here is miraculous they've got a 512 bit memory interface that actually if i recall
[7057.60 --> 7064.64]  correctly takes up um oh crap i can't remember but the the actual die area that they're using for the
[7064.64 --> 7070.48]  memory interface the efficiency of it has been improved by something stupid like 40 percent like
[7070.48 --> 7076.24]  it's amazing how much more memory bandwidth they've got in this card and it really is built for future
[7076.24 --> 7085.20]  gaming at 4k resolutions if you were to buy a future proof card today not a bad bet and like
[7085.20 --> 7090.08]  the idea that you can do sync aside the the singular word competitive idea that you brought up before
[7090.08 --> 7095.60]  actually comes back again because that stock it's ridiculous like if you compare price performance it's
[7095.60 --> 7101.68]  like what price to performance that bar graph looks real good in 290x's favor yeah
[7101.68 --> 7108.00]  all right what is the best 26 inch ips monitor i'm not aware of any 26 inch monitors
[7108.88 --> 7114.08]  that's kind of a weird size um but check out like the cheapo korean ones on ebay when he's going at
[7114.08 --> 7120.24]  that price yeah yeah at that price points um is the 780ti we don't know stop watching your gpu reviews
[7120.24 --> 7126.00]  because of overclocking that should be a side note not the main bench that's fine then don't don't watch
[7126.00 --> 7129.92]  it unless you're interested in overclocking numbers or if you want the technology overview
[7129.92 --> 7133.68]  because we combine them now now we do the introduction for the product talking about
[7133.68 --> 7137.76]  all the technology what's new what's different about it and then performance numbers were only
[7137.76 --> 7145.68]  like one quarter of the video so there and like that's that's cool you can go read or watch the
[7145.68 --> 7152.64]  150 other reviews that are all identical that all have stock numbers so that's that's fine we're doing
[7152.64 --> 7157.68]  things differently because we want to be a destination for people who do overclock their cards and who do want
[7157.68 --> 7162.40]  to know what the overclocking numbers look like and yes there's there's a little bit of silicon
[7162.40 --> 7168.08]  lottery going on we'll run into that and but we've said when that's actually been a big thing we had one
[7168.08 --> 7173.28]  card that did not overclock well and every single time that it was in the results of a video we said
[7173.28 --> 7180.56]  by the way our 7870 is a dog overclocker yeah so we we say it we know these things all right you
[7180.56 --> 7186.16]  should get yeah crushers those are the ones that i'm going to pick up just for lols oh god um mac pro entering
[7186.16 --> 7194.32]  apple into the very high-end sff market go um i think not at all i mean mac pro is is a professional
[7194.32 --> 7202.72]  appliance that's what it is it's not a a general purpose pc they have very they have very clearly
[7202.72 --> 7207.60]  positioned it that way this is a video editing workstation appliance that sits next to a video
[7207.60 --> 7213.60]  editing workstation or 3d rendering workstation it doesn't even come with anything other than fire gl cards
[7213.60 --> 7220.56]  like it's not it's i mean and i don't i don't personally feel like the mac pro is a great
[7220.56 --> 7226.24]  implementation it's only got one expansion slot internally it is pci express and it'll do one
[7226.24 --> 7230.88]  gigabyte per second reads and writes and whatever else these are all good things but it doesn't have
[7230.88 --> 7238.40]  the flexibility that we require as as a video production outfit and um i don't know i just
[7238.40 --> 7247.20]  they've lost so much um sex appeal with final cut over the last few years that i'll be interested to
[7247.20 --> 7252.64]  see if they can gain it back that's true it's really and they talk a lot about how quiet it is
[7252.64 --> 7257.28]  but that thing is going to be a hair dryer when it's actually under any kind of load they're only quoting
[7257.28 --> 7264.80]  idle numbers so let's see really yeah i didn't even look into that that's funny um what do you expect
[7264.80 --> 7268.48]  you know what we're we're kind of getting away from 29 how good will the 290x work as an editor's
[7268.48 --> 7276.72]  card with no idea no idea man amd is not allowing reference coolers till 2014 well i i heard that
[7276.72 --> 7282.32]  we'll at least have cards before then uh any interesting and okay we already saw that um a
[7282.32 --> 7288.08]  direct c2 and winforce 290x would be nice yeah i'll reach out to gigabyte as well 2014 is like really soon
[7288.08 --> 7292.72]  yeah that's like two months from now uh how much do you think drivers will improve over time i don't
[7292.72 --> 7297.04]  know hard to say because we saw a big improvement last time but this is still gcn so it's not a
[7297.04 --> 7302.32]  completely new architecture i i do still actually expect pretty good performance increases though
[7302.32 --> 7308.40]  to be honest i just don't know how much so i i okay i think we might just have to blow through a
[7308.40 --> 7312.88]  few more topics here and it's already 6 30 and we got to pack up for our meetup tomorrow we like
[7312.88 --> 7319.76]  totally expected a super short stream and end up being longer than average yeah so okay there's uh there's
[7319.76 --> 7326.56]  a thing uh speaking of my mobile carrier bell they are now beginning to use account data to um
[7326.56 --> 7333.04]  they're now beginning to store account data such as your name uh websites you browse um all kinds
[7333.04 --> 7338.08]  of stuff and they're going to be using this to target advertising at you as well as using it to sell
[7338.08 --> 7347.84]  hopefully anonymously to other companies um and this this sort of ties in nicely to this right here so
[7347.84 --> 7355.92]  this is the rally.stopwatchingus.us and it's a rally against the nsa and it is you know what i actually
[7355.92 --> 7360.64]  had a better segue that i meant to do for this i was going to say but i don't mind because who cares
[7360.64 --> 7365.04]  and then i was going to wait for twitch chat to explode and say well we care if you care get off your
[7365.04 --> 7366.64]  ass
[7368.64 --> 7373.44]  it's a speaking of getting off your ass they have an indiegogo campaign and this is the first time that
[7373.44 --> 7378.00]  i've seen something like this get backed by so many interesting people if you watch this video
[7378.00 --> 7384.16]  there's like a bunch of big names like it's not just a few people that decided to make a like like
[7386.08 --> 7390.72]  we are change level group like like i'm trying to think of the right name phone blocks or like yeah
[7391.76 --> 7396.40]  there we go it's not just a random group of people trying to rally behind something it's like a bunch
[7396.40 --> 7402.24]  of big names that could have reputations tarnished which you don't see that often it's usually
[7402.24 --> 7407.12]  yeah smaller groups and it's that makes it really interesting so particularly if you're an american
[7408.00 --> 7412.64]  um there's so the rally is going to be uh tomorrow actually in front of union station so if you're in
[7412.64 --> 7418.40]  washington dc uh might not be a bad idea to sign up to attend or you know tell some people who are in
[7418.40 --> 7424.56]  the area to attend if you can't make it there this is an important thing and privacy is eroding at an
[7424.56 --> 7429.76]  unbelievable rate actually pretty insanely fast the bell thing is a change to their terms of service
[7429.76 --> 7435.20]  that i wasn't notified about in any meaningful way it's like hidden away on their website and
[7435.20 --> 7440.24]  there's an opt out but i can only opt out of the targeted advertising i can't even opt out of them
[7440.24 --> 7445.92]  collecting the information all together so not giving me that kind of um that kind of freedom is
[7448.56 --> 7453.76]  very unsettling uh one thing to add before we move on if you want to support that campaign on the indiegogo
[7453.76 --> 7459.44]  side uh you can pick a few different things like you can have your donations go to sending more people
[7459.76 --> 7465.28]  on buses yeah more computer commuter lanes or you can go towards like materials for signs or whatever
[7465.28 --> 7474.24]  yeah all right so the 5s and 5c touch screens are evidently less accurate than the s3 so check this
[7474.24 --> 7480.40]  out guys so there's a study has found that the 5s and 5c are actually moving backwards in terms of
[7480.40 --> 7485.76]  touchscreen accuracy this is something that is very very important to me because i'm one of those people
[7485.76 --> 7491.04]  who actually goes for gold and tries to position the cursor in the middle of a typo and you know
[7491.04 --> 7496.16]  tries to correct stuff like that and i'm on an accurate touchscreen i'm pretty good and having an
[7496.16 --> 7503.20]  inaccuracy sort of ridden touchscreen is is not an appealing thing so check this out here is a heat map
[7503.20 --> 7509.04]  chart of where accuracy is within i believe it's one millimeter yeah yeah so it has to be within one
[7509.04 --> 7515.60]  millimeter yeah so iphone 5s is right here on the left iphone 5c is here on the left so they're clearly
[7515.60 --> 7521.92]  using some similarities uh there are some similarities between them and here's the galaxy s3 and i never
[7521.92 --> 7527.20]  had any kind of issue with this with my iphone 4 so it looks like this is a bit of a new thing yeah
[7527.20 --> 7530.88]  and i read in the comments a lot and a lot of people were talking about how it's it's not really a thing
[7530.88 --> 7535.76]  on the iphone 4 so it's actually gone backwards um reading in the comments people had tried the new
[7535.76 --> 7542.48]  one and had their old one and specifically could tell as you can see on that graphic right there sorry
[7542.48 --> 7549.44]  let me bring this back sorry the the q and the p are actually pretty much covered in red and what
[7549.44 --> 7554.72]  that means is they're not accurate to within one millimeter so which is important if you're touch
[7554.72 --> 7561.04]  typing on your smartphone so so people notice that going from the iphone 4 iphone 4s to this that trying
[7561.04 --> 7566.00]  to type q's and p's they're missing a lot speaking of touch typing on your smartphone did we do that topic
[7566.00 --> 7575.04]  yet what the uh the ruling that's been upheld no oh wow okay we got to do that all right let's launch
[7575.04 --> 7580.88]  right into that this is an article on daily tech that you need to go read go go read it it was about
[7580.88 --> 7588.88]  a week ago actually that this was posted but apple's patent on touch typing multi-touch upheld
[7588.88 --> 7597.84]  will allow a ban on most android devices now what the article goes on to say is that there is a specific
[7598.56 --> 7607.76]  um hold on a second there is a specificity to the apple patent that pertains to capacitive touch screens
[7607.76 --> 7613.60]  so while multi-touch gestures that for example don't require the user to draw an exactly horizontal or
[7613.60 --> 7619.60]  exactly vertical line but can instead uh draw the diagonal and touch typing on a keyboard on a
[7619.60 --> 7627.20]  touchscreen while these things existed they didn't exist on capacitive screens yet which leads us to
[7627.20 --> 7634.48]  this little clip right here hopefully you guys have audio and we have invented a new technology called
[7634.48 --> 7642.56]  multi-touch which is phenomenal it works like magic you don't need a stylus
[7643.60 --> 7649.84]  it's far more accurate than any touch display that's ever been shipped it ignores unintended
[7649.84 --> 7657.52]  touches it's super smart you can do multi-finger gestures on it so that boy have we patented it
[7662.16 --> 7669.84]  built into the original iphone boy did we patent it and they did so we could be looking at a situation
[7669.84 --> 7676.08]  okay so so the article goes on to say in the unlikely event that this could be overturned um
[7677.04 --> 7682.56]  maybe things would be okay but there's a very good chance and you can see there's some graphics here
[7682.56 --> 7690.88]  that android makers might have to look at some other solutions such as hardware keyboards um going back
[7690.88 --> 7698.24]  to that or figuring out some other way to implement uh wow what a disaster this is potentially
[7698.24 --> 7705.44]  kind of ridiculous so there are a couple guys that are safe number one is microsoft and nokia
[7705.44 --> 7711.12]  they're safe because of the way that apple and microsoft have worked together on cross-licensing
[7711.12 --> 7719.12]  patents in the past and so windows phone oh are we looking at a potential uh potentially huge ruling
[7719.12 --> 7723.68]  for windows phone who wasn't even involved in the decision no but they could be one of the biggest
[7723.68 --> 7730.16]  beneficiaries of this oh yeah and then the other one that's safe is htc so htc's whole thing with
[7730.16 --> 7734.72]  their uh here's to change campaign giveaway that we did on the linus tech tips channel it's actually
[7734.72 --> 7740.48]  still running we've had a few good video submissions to win an htc one but i haven't seen it that many
[7740.48 --> 7744.88]  yet so there's still very good chances to win that one give us your video entries the details are
[7744.88 --> 7750.88]  on the linus tech tips youtube channel front page it's the first video that plays but um htc's whole
[7750.88 --> 7755.76]  thing is like we're all about change we're all about innovation they own a lot of patents with
[7755.76 --> 7760.56]  respect to smartphones and the technology inside them and they were one of the ones that was locked
[7760.56 --> 7768.00]  in legal battles constantly with apple until a couple of years ago when both apple and htc basically just
[7768.00 --> 7773.44]  said okay okay fine like we're done i think from apple's perspective they didn't really see htc as much
[7773.44 --> 7778.24]  of a threat and from htc's perspective they could have gone out of business fighting legal wars with apple
[7778.24 --> 7785.12]  at that point and they basically went look let's just call a 10 a 10 year truce no more no more patent
[7785.12 --> 7791.04]  nonsense between our two companies so htc might be one of the only android handset makers not affected
[7791.04 --> 7799.52]  by this ruling so guys go read the article it's fantastic and also terrifying and if you're you know
[7799.52 --> 7804.80]  if a lot of the rulings in the past haven't seemed to affect anything like right here are a few
[7804.80 --> 7812.00]  um samsung devices that have already been banned for sale in the u.s that um they never really
[7812.00 --> 7816.16]  mattered because they were banned for sale at a time when they weren't really relevant anymore and
[7816.16 --> 7821.28]  samsung's been pretty pretty good about refreshing their products quickly enough that bands don't seem
[7821.28 --> 7830.88]  to really affect them too much yeah um so don't think it can happen product bands happen just because
[7830.88 --> 7836.48]  it hasn't affected the u.s much i mean we've even seen it in the it industry swift tech couldn't sell
[7836.48 --> 7842.56]  the h220 due to a patent dispute with asa tech um so still available in canada so this is a very
[7842.56 --> 7848.72]  regional thing but we might see uh some shifts even from guys like samsung to a windows os or
[7851.28 --> 7854.48]  wow anyway big big big news right there
[7854.48 --> 7862.80]  uh elon musk thinks that hydrogen cars are to paraphrase bullshit so this was an article on the
[7862.80 --> 7869.20]  verge i actually found this whole article just absolutely hilarious it was awesome uh so basically
[7869.20 --> 7877.92]  to applause he kind of goes well look the the ideal the ideal fuel cells would have less range and
[7877.92 --> 7883.68]  wouldn't be as optimal from a weight to performance perspective as current lithium-ion technology and
[7883.68 --> 7888.96]  you'd be building an entirely new infrastructure when the electrical grid is already there like
[7888.96 --> 7897.20]  it's there the power lines they're there it's like all of his points are just awesome because it's just
[7897.20 --> 7904.80]  like what are you guys doing it's like yeah tesla's gonna be a thing deal with it he should just put
[7904.80 --> 7909.52]  on sunglasses and just like say that rather than it and i mean i'm it's great that he made it's great
[7909.52 --> 7914.08]  it's great that he had you know a number of reasonable arguments about it but he could have
[7914.08 --> 7923.44]  just as easily gone all meme on us and just been like deal with it um so i guess that's pretty much
[7923.44 --> 7929.76]  it if i was buying a car and tesla was or the model s or some kind of model that they had was a lot
[7929.76 --> 7936.48]  cheaper i really don't think i'd be considering a car that burns hydrocarbons anymore if if teslas were
[7936.48 --> 7943.36]  affordable yeah are you kidding me well i'd be all over that i mean there is the so so-called
[7943.36 --> 7948.48]  convenience of being able to fill up your car once every however long and just drive it for until
[7948.48 --> 7955.28]  it's empty and i think that he can be a little bit idealistic sometimes it's like well you know it
[7955.28 --> 7960.08]  burns hydrocarbons you know what a lot of the world burns hydrocarbons to make electricity man so
[7960.08 --> 7965.44]  calm yourself down for a second here but you know in countries like canada where we're predominantly
[7965.44 --> 7971.36]  hydro-powered yay it's fantastic and you're definitely right about all of that but just
[7971.36 --> 7976.80]  like also just everything else in a tesla that's super good i hope they make like like the safety oh
[7976.80 --> 7982.96]  i hope they make like economy tesla yeah that would actually be really cool like tesla light or like
[7982.96 --> 7990.48]  tesla gt or no that gt would probably be good anyway i think we're pretty much done here guys thank you
[7990.48 --> 7995.92]  very much for tuning into the wan show i know it's an extremely long show and we don't really cover
[7995.92 --> 8002.80]  that much but we we appreciate you guys tuning in do you have any exciting forum news other than the
[8002.80 --> 8008.16]  new theme change um we've got a few things actually one there is a bill blogs of the week this time we're
[8008.16 --> 8013.04]  just having some serious troubles with the doc um so i don't know maybe i'll cover that after party
[8013.04 --> 8017.76]  maybe i'll cover that in the after party so there's an unofficial after party that sometimes i drop in
[8017.76 --> 8025.76]  on and raise my dongers and uh but it's on it's on luke's channel so it's luke underscore lafr which
[8025.76 --> 8030.24]  for whatever reason he thinks it's okay to leverage his position here at linus media group group for
[8030.24 --> 8035.12]  personal gains and to uh to drive viewership over to his personal channel do you know what i'm doing
[8035.12 --> 8040.88]  with the income from that channel personal gain i actually don't know but i heard that it was at least
[8040.88 --> 8050.40]  30 so far once we struggle our way and like climb to the mountain that is a hundred dollars of revenue
[8050.40 --> 8054.64]  on that twitch channel what i'm going to be doing is taking that revenue check and just buying stuff
[8054.64 --> 8059.44]  for the crazy giveaways that we do speaking of which tonight we're doing more giveaways like 15
[8059.44 --> 8063.44]  codes or something like that we usually do an insane amount fridays are our main day so we're going to
[8063.44 --> 8069.44]  give away a crazy amount um one of which i think is going to be hearthstone i've heard rumors from my
[8069.44 --> 8073.92]  guys that there's a hearthstone key in there rumors i know there's a payday 2 key in there i know there's
[8073.92 --> 8080.08]  a bunch of other big keys in there um but my stream aside the folding team is doing pretty ridiculous
[8080.08 --> 8086.00]  actually we're currently in eighth position for active folders and we're currently in 76 position
[8086.00 --> 8094.88]  overall ever world that's unbelievable obscene like that's unbelievable holy crap boink is doing well
[8094.88 --> 8101.36]  as well we are currently 10th in canada and 287th in the world which is actually quite good and yeah
[8101.36 --> 8105.60]  like i said there is going to be a bill logs of the week it'll be in the doc when it's posted on the
[8105.60 --> 8111.28]  forum and it will be in the after party when i so to be clear guys i'm not jelly like everyone's
[8111.28 --> 8117.76]  social media accounts here at linus media group do belong to them so you know ezel's twitter is his
[8117.76 --> 8124.24]  twitter luke's twitter is his twitter if luke gets a job at new egg tv i won't be happy about it in
[8124.24 --> 8128.56]  fact your non-compete says that you won't do that actually it says that i can but i just have to
[8128.56 --> 8133.28]  quit here first which makes sense okay but i won't but i mean i like to think we're a pretty tightly
[8133.28 --> 8139.12]  knit team here i believe that these guys should be able to do their own things i'm not that interested
[8139.12 --> 8143.92]  in we've discussed it i mean he pushed me really hard to do more game streaming to do after party to
[8143.92 --> 8149.12]  do all these things and it's not in the linus media group business model to chase the game streaming
[8149.12 --> 8154.64]  thing so we discussed it he's got his own game streaming channel if you know if he's got a
[8154.64 --> 8158.24]  social media following there and that works out really well for him and he does whatever he wants
[8158.24 --> 8164.96]  to do with that i think that's fantastic and there's no there's i was joking before there's no there's no
[8164.96 --> 8170.80]  weirdness about it so you know if these guys if you want to follow people at linus media group on twitter
[8170.80 --> 8176.48]  know that you're interacting with them personally and that this is not a company initiative that we're uh that
[8176.48 --> 8180.72]  we're doing so people have people have said that my certain tweets have been paid off before
[8180.72 --> 8186.88]  because i seem to recommend the same things a lot i don't pay you because i use the same things a lot
[8186.88 --> 8191.12]  and i like them like someone's like oh you must get paid off by ducky and i'm like i recommend ducky
[8191.12 --> 8195.92]  and filco in the exact same line every single time anyone has ever asked me about a keyboard what are you
[8195.92 --> 8204.00]  saying like what do you want i buy this stuff i recommend it i like these keyboards that's life
[8204.00 --> 8209.52]  it's ridiculous like i'm sorry i'm sorry uh you know what i'm gonna save this for next week because
[8209.52 --> 8214.48]  i haven't tried it yet yeah all right peace out guys thank you for watching the land show and we'll
[8214.48 --> 8219.44]  see you again next week same bat time same bat channel bye bye
