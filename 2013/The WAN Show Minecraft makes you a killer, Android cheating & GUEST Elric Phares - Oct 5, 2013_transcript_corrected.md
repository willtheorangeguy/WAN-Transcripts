[1.00 → 6.00] Welcome to the WAN Show everyone. We've got a fantastic show for you here today. In fact,
[6.00 → 9.96] I was a little bit surprised because when we were going through the topics for this
[9.96 → 13.00] week a couple of days ago, I was like, oh, it's actually...
[13.00 → 14.00] It's not a ton really.
[14.00 → 20.08] Yeah, well compared to last week when we had all the things to discuss, that was just
[20.08 → 25.68] like crazy as all balls. But this week is turning out to look actually pretty darn good.
[25.68 → 31.76] Our special guest today is Eric from Tech of Tomorrow, formerly from Motherboards.org.
[31.76 → 34.44] Maybe we can poke him a little bit and see if we can get him to...
[34.44 → 38.22] Actually, you know what? Let's not dig up the past. Let's not dig up the past.
[38.22 → 42.64] But we've got Eric joining us today for our guest segment, and I'd love to do a preview
[42.64 → 50.02] of the topics we've got today. So number one, guys, is clocked up your daughters and sons and
[50.02 → 58.78] badgers because Minecraft will turn your kids into unslinging, knife-toting, violent,
[58.78 → 59.78] violent people.
[59.78 → 61.78] I can't believe this got out.
[61.78 → 62.78] Minecraft.
[62.78 → 63.78] With GTA 5.
[63.78 → 64.78] I know.
[64.78 → 67.78] Like the timing is hilarious.
[67.78 → 74.32] The timing is fantastic. More on that later, guys. Cheating in Android benchmarks is definitely
[74.32 → 80.96] a thing. So we are going to discuss the state of the Android ecosystem and what cheating means
[80.96 → 88.08] to consumers and manufacturers and why it gets done when they get caught every time.
[88.08 → 91.84] This is the exact same thing we've seen on the PC platform.
[91.84 → 97.08] We've seen it on the PC. We'll see it again on smartwatches. Quote me on that.
[97.08 → 98.08] That's true.
[98.08 → 99.08] What else we got?
[99.08 → 103.98] We've got Control-Delete-Was-A-Mistake-Admitted-By-Bill Gates. Kind of an interesting little conversation
[103.98 → 109.64] that happened there. And Steam Machine specs unveiled by XI3 and Valve. And the Valve Steam
[109.64 → 112.12] Machine specs that were unveiled were the prototype ones that are going in.
[112.12 → 113.32] Kind of all over the place.
[113.32 → 114.68] And yeah, all over the place.
[114.68 → 120.32] All right. So why don't we kick things off with BA-dum-ba, the intro.
[129.08 → 148.12] All right, guys. So this week's episode of the WAN Show is brought to you by Hotspot Shield.
[148.12 → 154.64] You get 20% off elite prices with the offer code Linus. You can sign up at bit.ly or bit.ly
[154.64 → 160.24] slash HS share. And you will be among the... Actually, I talked to them today. You will be
[160.24 → 167.76] among the 430 Linus Tech Tips viewers so far that have already signed up with them, which
[167.76 → 172.60] is pretty cool. There was one post on the forum from someone that had an issue with customer
[172.60 → 177.02] service. And within a matter of, I think it was about a day, Hotspot Shield had posted
[177.02 → 181.76] on our forum, fixed it with them, posted their email address for any other Linus Tech Tips viewers
[181.76 → 185.20] that had any kind of issues with the service. So that's... I thought that was...
[185.20 → 186.20] That's cool.
[186.20 → 187.20] I thought that was pretty cool.
[187.20 → 188.20] I got an industry affiliate then.
[188.20 → 190.20] Yeah. We should probably... I haven't told you about...
[190.20 → 193.20] I was like, I didn't hear about this.
[193.20 → 198.56] Don't worry. Don't worry. We got this. Anyway, guys, 20% off elite prices. So bit.ly
[198.56 → 204.72] slash HS share. So let's move into our first news item of the week, which is actually a pretty
[204.72 → 208.76] minor... a pretty minor item. It's just more of a funny thing.
[208.76 → 215.32] Yeah. So Bill Gates admits... this was posted on the forum by Snow Comet. Bill Gates admits
[215.32 → 224.26] Control-Alt-Delete was a mistake and blames IBM. So first, Control-Alt-Delete, as
[224.26 → 229.10] far as key combinations go, I mean, that's kind of like saying Alt-F4 was a mistake, except
[229.10 → 235.06] that it's not. Because Control-Alt-Delete, in Microsoft's mind, should have been one button.
[235.06 → 240.62] Yeah. And at the time, the functionality was to restart your computer. It's evolved over
[240.62 → 243.62] time, and we still have it today. And then the other functionality, of course, at the
[243.62 → 248.00] time was to prove that you were a human being sitting in front of a computer. Now, from a
[248.00 → 251.62] security standpoint... That's not a very good proof.
[251.62 → 260.18] Was it ever effective, though? I can't see a way that it could have been, but maybe someone
[260.18 → 264.18] better than me knows a way that it could have been. Because from my standpoint, you can just
[264.18 → 269.18] mimic those key presses. It's not a big deal. So Control-Alt-Delete, if they'd had their
[269.18 → 274.98] way, would have been a single button which would have saved us how many billions of keystrokes
[274.98 → 280.58] over the last few years. Basically, the original article was from The Verge, so you can go ahead
[280.58 → 284.54] and check it out over there. But pretty much, he was giving a talk, and everyone kind of
[284.54 → 290.98] had a good laugh about it. The IBM keyboard designer just kind of refused to implement it, which I...
[290.98 → 298.34] Which, honestly, in my opinion, I have no real problem with. Like, it's the least big deal ever.
[298.34 → 304.50] Yeah, we just thought that was kind of funny, so we're not going to spend too much time on it. Let's go ahead and move into our next topic.
[304.50 → 312.78] It's... I don't know. It's just... I think the thing about it that sticks out most to me is how these legacy things just keep carrying forward.
[312.78 → 312.90] Yeah.
[312.90 → 323.90] And carrying forward to the point where Control-Alt-Delete has very different functionality today, and you have to basically be in the BIOS, or in like a pre-Windows environment for it to even reboot your computer.
[323.90 → 329.26] But what you can do is you can bring up the task manager, you can lock the computer, and there's...
[329.26 → 335.30] And some places still use it to authenticate that it is an actual user sitting in front of the PC.
[335.30 → 336.26] Yeah, yeah. Server login.
[336.26 → 336.90] Yeah.
[336.90 → 337.90] So you have to Control-Alt-Delete.
[337.90 → 338.90] Server logins...
[338.90 → 346.90] One thing I think is interesting, though, is like, if that didn't happen, if the mistake, quote-unquote, didn't happen, how many, like, key things...
[346.90 → 352.34] Like, there's so many people I know that can do it without looking. Without having hands on the keyboard and just go, boom.
[352.34 → 359.90] And just hit it. And, like, there was that thing before where someone made a fake little keyboard that was just Control-Alt-Delete, and they were like, this is all you need to use Windows.
[359.90 → 365.34] Like, all that stuff, the cult following that Control-Alt-Delete has, to be completely honest, like...
[365.34 → 368.18] Well, if they had one key, if there was like the...
[368.18 → 369.30] Would it have been the same, though?
[369.32 → 373.26] If there was like the O-Balls key or something like that, that might have been all right.
[373.76 → 374.54] Probably, yeah.
[374.70 → 376.46] But, yeah. Yeah, we love it.
[376.46 → 381.46] Let's go ahead and move into our next topic. This is actually one that is...
[381.46 → 384.46] That hits pretty close to home for me, because...
[384.46 → 388.46] Here in Canada, we have...
[388.46 → 390.46] Oh, no, I actually was going to go...
[390.46 → 394.46] Okay, let's talk about a couple different things that are going on with smartphones in the EU.
[394.46 → 394.96] Okay.
[394.96 → 401.46] So, this isn't exactly new, but I just want to talk about this, because it's something that I personally feel quite strongly about.
[401.46 → 408.46] And that is that the EU, this was on BBC, plans to end mobile phone roaming charges.
[408.46 → 411.46] So, this would be implemented by 2016.
[411.46 → 416.46] And in 2014, it would be eliminating roaming charges for incoming calls.
[416.46 → 422.46] And as someone who lives in Canada, we don't have the greatest mobile phone rates.
[422.46 → 423.46] We also don't have the worst ones.
[423.46 → 424.46] Nope.
[424.46 → 430.46] I mean, I pay about $100 a month for my business plan that includes 5 gigs of data,
[430.46 → 434.46] basically unlimited calling for all intents and purposes.
[434.46 → 443.46] It includes US calling when I'm at home, which is great, because you'd be amazed how many people just don't want to bother with Skype and want to talk on the phone.
[443.46 → 446.46] And most of the people we work with are in the US.
[446.46 → 451.46] So, I would be paying a fortune in long distance if I didn't have that kind of plan.
[451.46 → 453.46] And it's really not that bad.
[453.46 → 455.46] It's all $100 a month.
[455.46 → 456.46] But the thing that kills you...
[456.46 → 459.46] So, I was over in Hawaii for about eight days.
[459.46 → 463.46] $6 a Meg is the roaming charge.
[463.46 → 466.46] I think it's something like $0.75 a text.
[466.46 → 471.46] And to me, this is basically...
[471.46 → 488.46] To me, the only excuse for this kind of behaviour and these kinds of charges is the back room of a lady club where there are fat dudes with cigars sitting around going like...
[488.46 → 494.46] You know, like placing bets on the table for how much they think that people would be willing to pay in roaming charges.
[494.46 → 504.46] And I mean, even roaming plans where it's like, yeah, $50 gets you, you know, a 100th of what you normally have access to with your regular plan while you're on the go.
[504.46 → 507.46] There's no reason that it has to be done.
[507.46 → 518.46] And I really applaud the EU for being progressively thinking when it comes to these infrastructure items that I think unify people.
[518.46 → 526.46] And I think they make travel, and they make the global economy more of a thing where travel can become less expensive.
[526.46 → 531.46] In every way, whether it's planes or trains or Hyperloop or...
[531.46 → 534.46] Okay, so Elon Musk isn't building the Hyperloop, but I...
[534.46 → 538.46] Anyway, I really admire that. I think it's fantastic.
[538.46 → 545.46] There's interesting stuff too because you'd automatically think when you go roaming somewhere that you should pre-purchase the roaming plan because it'll save you all the danger.
[545.46 → 548.46] One of my friends when we went down to PAX pre-purchased the roaming plan. It was $40.
[548.46 → 549.46] Yeah.
[549.46 → 555.46] I didn't. Took all the hits and was still totally fine and under $40. It was still really expensive and stupid.
[555.46 → 560.46] So it's just like, would you like to bend over the couch, or would you like to bend over the bed?
[560.46 → 564.46] It's totally up to you as long as you bend over and take it from your telco.
[564.46 → 565.46] Yeah.
[565.46 → 569.46] Now there are challenges associated with this because you're asking for telcos to cooperate.
[569.46 → 574.46] In the EU, it's going to require wireless providers to have...
[574.46 → 577.46] I think it was, yeah, the proposals must be approved by the 28 EU members.
[577.46 → 582.46] And they also have to have permission to operate and conduct business, so to speak.
[582.46 → 586.46] In all of those countries, I think there's going to be a lot of consolidation in the market where...
[586.46 → 587.46] Yeah.
[587.46 → 599.46] ...the large players in the larger markets, whether it's Germany or the UK, are going to have a huge leg up on the smaller providers in the smaller EU countries.
[599.46 → 604.46] And I think it's going to put a lot of people out of business. And there are problems with all of this.
[604.46 → 613.46] But I think that it has to happen at some point. And I would love it if even Canada and US got together and cooperated.
[613.46 → 615.46] Yeah. I'm surprised it hasn't happened yet.
[615.46 → 622.46] Well, of course it hasn't happened because whether it's Verizon or Bell or Rogers or AT&T, they all love to damn roaming charges.
[622.46 → 623.46] That's true.
[623.46 → 624.46] They all love it.
[624.46 → 629.46] But with everything else that Canada and the US does together, I'm actually going to be surprised that's not one of them.
[629.46 → 634.46] Well, it's one of those things where it takes a government mandate to make telcos cooperate with each other.
[634.46 → 635.46] Have you seen...
[635.46 → 637.46] Well, cooperate with each other above board.
[637.46 → 638.46] Right, right.
[638.46 → 639.46] So...
[639.46 → 643.46] Have you seen all that stuff lately, the Canadian government attacking wireless companies?
[643.46 → 646.46] Their webpage, what not, what not.
[646.46 → 648.46] I didn't bother to put that in the thing because we've talked too much.
[648.46 → 649.46] We've talked enough about that.
[649.46 → 650.46] But like, it's...
[650.46 → 652.46] Yeah, they're kind of mad.
[652.46 → 653.46] Yeah.
[653.46 → 654.46] That's good.
[654.46 → 655.46] That's good.
[655.46 → 656.46] I'm glad.
[656.46 → 661.46] We need more government regulation on the telecommunications guys because it is getting ridiculous.
[661.46 → 668.46] So, speaking of government regulations and sometimes them getting involved in things that they don't fully understand,
[668.46 → 669.46] this one is new.
[669.46 → 673.46] It was posted by BamBamLolly on the forum.
[673.46 → 677.46] The EU wants every smartphone and tablet to charge by micro USB.
[677.46 → 684.46] So, the original article was on the verge as posted by our forum member who is helpfully putting in his sources.
[684.46 → 694.46] And I agree with the idea that every smartphone should use a universal standard.
[694.46 → 701.46] But what I disagree with is that micro USB should be it.
[701.46 → 705.46] So, let's get into it, shall we?
[705.46 → 707.46] I'm just... just go.
[707.46 → 708.46] I'm just off.
[708.46 → 709.46] I'm just off.
[709.46 → 717.46] Okay, I'm going to start this by saying I've been called out a little bit over the last week or so because I did tweet about this a little bit.
[717.46 → 727.46] Where people are saying, okay, well, Linus's quotes about how fragile micro USB is are from some company that didn't have it validated by a third party etc, etc, etc, etc.
[727.46 → 730.46] So, let's set aside the quotes for now.
[730.46 → 732.46] Guys, hit us on Twitter.
[732.46 → 734.46] Simple yes, no.
[734.46 → 738.46] Have you ever had a micro USB connection fail?
[738.46 → 740.46] I want that to be the first answer.
[740.46 → 741.46] And then yes, no.
[741.46 → 748.46] Have you ever had a full-size USB or a mini B connection fail?
[748.46 → 753.46] So, your post should read, no, no, if you've never had anything fail.
[753.46 → 755.46] Yes, no, if you've had this one and not this one.
[755.46 → 758.46] And yes, yes, if you've had both of them fail, guys, hit us on Twitter.
[758.46 → 759.46] We're going to go through your thoughts.
[759.46 → 763.46] But my problem is I have personally had micro USB fail and not...
[763.46 → 764.46] Okay, it's validated...
[764.46 → 765.46] I'll let you talk in a minute.
[765.46 → 769.46] It's validated for a thousand plugs or something like that.
[769.46 → 773.46] The problem I have is how fragile physically the connector is.
[773.46 → 776.46] It can be validated for whatever you want.
[776.46 → 779.46] But in the real world, we don't carefully plug it in and unplug it.
[779.46 → 783.46] We don't even plug it in quickly straight and unplug it straight.
[783.46 → 792.46] We run into situations where our phones are dead, we really need a charge, we're on the go, we take a portable battery bank, we plug it into it, we jam the whole thing in our pocket.
[792.46 → 794.46] That is the real world.
[794.46 → 801.46] Especially in this day and age of cell phones that don't last for a week on battery like they did when I first got a cell phone.
[801.46 → 808.46] We have moved so far backwards to the point where when I'm heavily using my HTC One, I might have to charge it a couple of times in a day.
[808.46 → 810.46] I'm talking really heavy use.
[810.46 → 819.46] I burned through 20% of my battery in about 15 minutes today when I had tethering on, and I was using it for navigation and the screen was on.
[819.46 → 820.46] They go fast.
[820.46 → 828.46] So micro USB is fragile even if it is reliable or whatever other term you want to use for it lasting a long time.
[828.46 → 835.46] So with all of that said, I don't have an alternative connector I like better.
[835.46 → 839.46] I actually, well okay, I don't think mini USB B was that bad.
[839.46 → 845.46] If you actually objectively look at them and compare them, they are not that different.
[845.46 → 856.46] The only real difference on a modern cell phone implementation, even on something like the HTC One, would be that you'd get less of a sort of support around it.
[856.46 → 859.46] Which I find that that connector doesn't need as much with that said.
[859.46 → 861.46] The internals of the connector are bulkier.
[861.46 → 866.46] But they could have moved it closer to the centre and that could have still worked.
[866.46 → 874.46] So okay, maybe mini B isn't the answer, but I would rather they develop a more rugged standard as opposed to just making it a standard.
[874.46 → 877.46] That making it a standard eyes on this fragile connector.
[877.46 → 881.46] To play against your question that you're putting on Twitter.
[881.46 → 886.46] A, USB, like standard USB is obviously a lot better.
[886.46 → 887.46] I know, and it's huge. I know.
[887.46 → 889.46] And could never be put on a phone.
[889.46 → 890.46] Yes.
[890.46 → 891.46] And that's ridiculous.
[891.46 → 892.46] So that doesn't matter.
[892.46 → 895.46] Phone blocks, my magical phone, could have like an interface module.
[895.46 → 903.46] That would be awesome if you could be like, no, this is my power connector.
[903.46 → 904.46] Anyway.
[904.46 → 906.46] I want to use an AC wall outlet.
[906.46 → 908.46] Bulkiness of the phone be damned.
[908.46 → 911.46] It's going to be this thick, and it's going to run on AC power.
[911.46 → 913.46] Like standard computer power.
[913.46 → 914.46] Anyway.
[914.46 → 917.46] And then mini B, like no one ever uses.
[917.46 → 918.46] So your metric there.
[918.46 → 919.46] It used to be the standard.
[919.46 → 922.46] Micro USB is going to have a bunch of people that use it.
[922.46 → 923.46] Every camera.
[923.46 → 925.46] And a bunch of people using it for different devices.
[925.46 → 927.46] Every camera was mini B.
[927.46 → 929.46] And mini B is going to have a tiny, much smaller pool of B.
[929.46 → 932.46] Well it's dead now, but it used to be much more popular than micro cameras.
[932.46 → 933.46] And it was mainly on cameras.
[933.46 → 934.46] Yes.
[934.46 → 937.46] Which were the portable electronics of the time.
[937.46 → 942.46] And not nearly as many people had a freaking camera as they have smartphones.
[942.46 → 944.46] So the metrics do not line up.
[944.46 → 948.46] So your one side has way more population than your other side, and it's not a fair competition.
[948.46 → 949.46] Okay, fine.
[949.46 → 950.46] And you know what?
[950.46 → 955.46] I'm going to devil's advocate myself a little bit here because I did run into a situation
[955.46 → 962.46] this very week twice where I found myself wishing that my Pebble, which is awesome by the way,
[962.46 → 964.46] doesn't have micro USB.
[964.46 → 967.46] I lost the magnetic connector, which is awesome and I love magnetic chargers.
[967.46 → 969.46] I lost it twice.
[969.46 → 974.46] Once when I wanted to shoot the original unboxing, I had left it at home, and I was like, oh balls.
[974.46 → 979.46] Because I could have run around anywhere in the studio here and grabbed a micro USB cable, chucked
[979.46 → 982.46] it in the box and pretended that was the one it came with, and it would have saved me a lot
[982.46 → 983.46] of time.
[983.46 → 985.46] But I couldn't because it uses a proprietary cable.
[985.46 → 989.46] And then again, when Brandon needed to shoot the B roll for it.
[989.46 → 993.46] But then in your defence, you're not against the unification of the cable.
[993.46 → 994.46] No.
[994.46 → 995.46] You're against micro USB.
[995.46 → 996.46] So that's not actually...
[996.46 → 999.46] Oh, if we could have like a magnetic USB standard cable.
[999.46 → 1000.46] Yeah.
[1000.46 → 1002.46] So that's not really like, that's not really a point to gain.
[1002.46 → 1006.46] Bring it on because there will be teething panes in any transition.
[1006.46 → 1007.46] I mean, micro USBs.
[1007.46 → 1009.46] Remember when we never used to have enough of those.
[1009.46 → 1010.46] Yeah.
[1010.46 → 1014.46] There will be teething panes, but if we could have a standard that just falls away when you
[1014.46 → 1018.46] trip on it, like a magnetic connector, that would be amazing.
[1018.46 → 1019.46] I'd be down with that.
[1019.46 → 1020.46] Amazing.
[1020.46 → 1025.46] Alright, so let's go ahead and see what kind of results we got on that there Twitter blitz.
[1025.46 → 1028.46] I don't know how many people have followed the instructions because a lot of people are
[1028.46 → 1029.46] just like, oh, they're doing a Twitter blitz.
[1029.46 → 1032.46] I'll use this as an opportunity to say something completely unrelated.
[1032.46 → 1034.46] Oh, it seems to be working pretty well.
[1034.46 → 1035.46] Alright.
[1035.46 → 1036.46] So there we go.
[1036.46 → 1037.46] Hey, people are doing it.
[1037.46 → 1038.46] So we've got...
[1038.46 → 1043.46] Wow, this browser is being a big giant pile of poo.
[1043.46 → 1045.46] It is lagging out so hard.
[1045.46 → 1046.46] Alright, so yes, no.
[1046.46 → 1047.46] No, no.
[1047.46 → 1048.46] Wow.
[1048.46 → 1050.46] Yeah, I can't even do this.
[1050.46 → 1057.46] So, so far, of the people who haven't had nothing die on them, we have three for micro and
[1057.46 → 1058.46] one for mini.
[1058.46 → 1060.46] We have another no for both.
[1060.46 → 1062.46] We have Twitter being...
[1062.46 → 1064.46] Or not Twitter, but Chrome being a big pile of junk.
[1064.46 → 1067.46] Alright, another one for micro, another one for micro.
[1067.46 → 1068.46] No for both.
[1068.46 → 1069.46] Micro but not mini.
[1069.46 → 1070.46] No for both.
[1070.46 → 1071.46] Yes to both.
[1071.46 → 1073.46] No micro but yes mini.
[1073.46 → 1075.46] Yes to micro, no to mini.
[1075.46 → 1077.46] Yes to micro, no to mini.
[1077.46 → 1078.46] So, okay.
[1078.46 → 1079.46] Let's say...
[1079.46 → 1080.46] Let's say...
[1080.46 → 1082.46] Yeah, and it's lagging out again.
[1082.46 → 1083.46] This is ridiculous.
[1083.46 → 1084.46] We're going to have to switch browsers.
[1084.46 → 1086.46] We'll find some time to do that in a moment.
[1086.46 → 1092.46] But, mostly, you guys are saying that micro USB breaks on you more often, but again, as
[1092.46 → 1093.46] Luke was saying...
[1093.46 → 1094.46] It's skewed metrics.
[1094.46 → 1098.46] Yeah, it's skewed because there's a much larger install base for micro.
[1098.46 → 1103.46] That being said, I've used a lot of both, and I've only had micro USB fail on me.
[1103.46 → 1104.46] Like, I'm just...
[1104.46 → 1107.46] For me, the problem isn't the cable so much as the receptacle.
[1107.46 → 1108.46] Yeah.
[1108.46 → 1114.46] And, on something like a phone where we're talking a $600 plus piece of electronics where
[1114.46 → 1120.46] it has this one failure point where if you bump it once, it's completely dead and there's
[1120.46 → 1121.46] no repairing it.
[1121.46 → 1122.46] Yeah.
[1122.46 → 1125.46] And like, every once in a while you'll find that device that comes with a cable and that
[1125.46 → 1129.46] device and that cable like click together, and it feels perfect, and you're like,
[1129.46 → 1130.46] oh, that's going to be solid forever.
[1130.46 → 1131.46] Yeah.
[1131.46 → 1132.46] And it is.
[1132.46 → 1136.46] And then you go to plug in like a random USB or even the one that comes with your phone
[1136.46 → 1137.46] I found sometimes.
[1137.46 → 1142.46] And you plug it in, and you can like to move the whole phone like oscillating around where the
[1142.46 → 1143.46] actual plug is in.
[1143.46 → 1146.46] It's like, that's not going to work for very long.
[1146.46 → 1148.46] It's like, oh, come on.
[1148.46 → 1149.46] Like, I don't know.
[1149.46 → 1150.46] You can see it coming a lot of the time.
[1150.46 → 1155.46] And then like you said, putting it in your pocket kills it a lot of the time too.
[1155.46 → 1156.46] Alright.
[1156.46 → 1159.46] So let's do one more major topic before we bring our guest on.
[1159.46 → 1162.46] Apparently you didn't even get back to them about having not done the test call.
[1162.46 → 1163.46] Do you have them added on?
[1163.46 → 1165.46] I thought I said that.
[1165.46 → 1166.46] On voice chat.
[1166.46 → 1167.46] Okay.
[1167.46 → 1170.46] If you have to go bail for a couple of minutes, and I'll handle this topic on my own and make
[1170.46 → 1172.46] sure you just kind of get that figured out.
[1172.46 → 1173.46] I just replied to the email.
[1173.46 → 1176.46] So here we go, guys.
[1176.46 → 1177.46] Parents.
[1177.46 → 1178.46] Actually, you know what?
[1178.46 → 1179.46] I'll save that one.
[1179.46 → 1181.46] I'll save that one to talk about with you.
[1181.46 → 1182.46] Alright.
[1182.46 → 1188.46] This was a post on the forum a long time ago and kind of funny story here was Slick's
[1188.46 → 1197.46] been using the priority inbox in Gmail basically since Linus Media Group was formed and only
[1197.46 → 1202.46] realized this week that, I don't know what would you say, about half of the emails you
[1202.46 → 1205.46] get from me have not been being flagged as priority.
[1205.46 → 1207.46] At least 25%.
[1207.46 → 1208.46] Okay.
[1208.46 → 1210.46] So let's say at least a quarter of them.
[1210.46 → 1213.46] So guys, priority inbox, if you don't already know, I really don't recommend using it.
[1213.46 → 1216.46] I found it makes a lot of things escape from you.
[1216.46 → 1217.46] I just...
[1217.46 → 1218.46] So...
[1218.46 → 1219.46] Oh, okay.
[1219.46 → 1221.46] You weren't CC'd I guess so that's a bit of a problem.
[1221.46 → 1226.46] So basically, this article was actually posted on the Linus Tech Tips forum by Queen back
[1226.46 → 1227.46] in June.
[1227.46 → 1229.46] And it was something that I emailed.
[1229.46 → 1232.46] I was like, hey, we should talk about this on the WAN show.
[1232.46 → 1241.46] So, load line calibration or V-droop, a sort of V-droop compensation is something that many
[1241.46 → 1247.46] motherboard manufacturers have implemented in order to potentially stabilize over clocks.
[1247.46 → 1251.46] However, it's one of those things where the motherboard manufacturers put it on there,
[1251.46 → 1255.46] extreme overclockers do tend to use the setting from time to time.
[1255.46 → 1259.46] But if you ask most of the motherboard guys, or you ask Intel, they'll say, well, you know
[1259.46 → 1260.46] what?
[1260.46 → 1263.46] It's part of the Intel spec, so we'd really recommend that you leave it on.
[1263.46 → 1269.46] And what happens is when your CPU goes under load, the motherboard actually drops the amount
[1269.46 → 1271.46] of voltage it's delivering to the CPU.
[1271.46 → 1272.46] This does a couple of things.
[1272.46 → 1279.46] It reduces heat output, and it also improves longevity of the CPU and reduces power consumption.
[1279.46 → 1285.46] The flip side of that is if you set a voltage to your CPU with the objective of making it
[1285.46 → 1291.46] stable at higher clock speeds, like if you're overclocking, you don't necessarily want your
[1291.46 → 1296.46] motherboard dropping the voltage when you're in a load, under a heavy load or intensive
[1296.46 → 1301.46] situation because, well, I told you I wanted the voltage and I wanted the power, and you're
[1301.46 → 1302.46] turning it off on me.
[1302.46 → 1306.46] So, this article was just done by one of our forum members.
[1306.46 → 1311.46] It's not the most scientific thing I've ever seen, but basically he took some time and used
[1311.46 → 1318.46] a Rampage 4 Extreme and a 3930K to test with a digital multimeter what the actual settings
[1318.46 → 1324.46] were, what was actually being delivered to his CPU on that board with different load line
[1324.46 → 1325.46] calibration settings.
[1325.46 → 1331.46] And I thought it was absolutely fascinating just because there's some pretty interesting
[1331.46 → 1332.46] stuff going on.
[1332.46 → 1337.46] It has a huge effect on the voltages that your CPUs are going to be running at, whether
[1337.46 → 1340.46] it's at idle or whether it's at load.
[1340.46 → 1341.46] And it is definitely worth a read.
[1341.46 → 1344.46] It will be posted in the WAN show document after the show.
[1344.46 → 1350.46] But if not, you can always search on the forum for load-line calibration, why overclockers
[1350.46 → 1353.46] should care, and you can check out that article.
[1353.46 → 1358.46] Little tip, if you want to search on the forum, just go to Google and do like, Landis Tech
[1358.46 → 1361.46] Tips and then load-line calibration forum, and it will probably come up better because
[1361.46 → 1362.46] our search sucks.
[1362.46 → 1363.46] I know, the search is terrible.
[1363.46 → 1364.46] It is.
[1364.46 → 1370.46] We're hoping that they fix it in IPS version 4, which is in alpha right now, and we will
[1370.46 → 1371.46] not be beta testing.
[1371.46 → 1372.46] Yeah.
[1372.46 → 1374.46] No more beta testing forum software.
[1374.46 → 1377.46] You know what, we've got a little bit more time.
[1377.46 → 1381.46] So Warcraft the movie is coming out on December 18th.
[1381.46 → 1382.46] Oh.
[1382.46 → 1383.46] Okay.
[1383.46 → 1385.46] There are a couple different ways this can go.
[1385.46 → 1386.46] Yeah.
[1386.46 → 1390.46] People were stoked so hard on, what was it, Advent Children or whatever they called that
[1390.46 → 1392.46] first Final Fantasy movie.
[1392.46 → 1393.46] What was it?
[1393.46 → 1395.46] Yeah, that was at least one of them.
[1395.46 → 1396.46] I can't remember.
[1396.46 → 1397.46] I don't know if that was the first one.
[1397.46 → 1402.46] I watched about 30% of it, and I was like, this is the most boring, stupid thing that
[1402.46 → 1403.46] I've ever seen.
[1403.46 → 1404.46] I kind of expected that.
[1404.46 → 1411.46] The CG, okay, the problem is that, okay, at that time I hadn't played a Final Fantasy
[1411.46 → 1413.46] game since like Final Fantasy 6.
[1413.46 → 1419.46] So I was expecting a story that wasn't just like the stupidest thing ever.
[1419.46 → 1425.46] Like I was expecting it to be more than just a tech demo, and it really wasn't.
[1425.46 → 1426.46] I was incredibly disappointed.
[1426.46 → 1430.46] I was at a friend's house, and we were watching it together, and I was just like, I'm going
[1430.46 → 1431.46] to go play Sims.
[1431.46 → 1437.46] And that was the one time I ever sat down and played The Sims because I was that bored.
[1437.46 → 1441.46] Was that, I can't remember the names because I'm Deeping right now, but was that the Final
[1441.46 → 1444.46] Fantasy movie where she has to go find, she's trying to find plant life?
[1444.46 → 1446.46] I don't even remember man.
[1446.46 → 1447.46] Like it was terrible.
[1447.46 → 1449.46] I didn't find the one where she has to go find plant life.
[1449.46 → 1455.46] So Warcraft movie could end up being like just a tech demo for CGI, and I'm going to
[1455.46 → 1460.46] go for CGI and, um, but it's blizzard, but it's blizzard.
[1460.46 → 1466.46] So it also could end up having like the best story ever and launching an entire series of
[1466.46 → 1470.46] movies and a franchise that could be amazing.
[1470.46 → 1473.46] I'm a huge fan of the Warcraft lore.
[1473.46 → 1478.46] Like I love the Warcraft lore and I linked something in this document so you guys can check it out
[1478.46 → 1484.46] later, which is a compilation of HD remakes of all the cinematic, not like cut scenes,
[1484.46 → 1486.46] but cinematic from Warcraft three.
[1486.46 → 1489.46] And like they're epic.
[1489.46 → 1490.46] Everything's epic.
[1490.46 → 1496.46] Like when, when, when Art has is succeeding you and stabs you the guy's thing and his crown rolls down the stairs.
[1496.46 → 1498.46] Like that's so ridiculously epic.
[1498.46 → 1504.46] And I expect it to be more like fighting and war and epic scenes and stuff like that.
[1504.46 → 1506.46] Then I would expect from the Final Fantasy.
[1506.46 → 1509.46] So if someone could pull this off, would it be blizzard then?
[1509.46 → 1513.46] I think so because we also saw, um, Prince of Persia.
[1513.46 → 1519.46] Cause Square's whole thing was, was cinematic and being awesome at cut scenes and making them epic.
[1519.46 → 1525.46] Even though, you know, the games themselves, particularly these days don't necessarily have a lot of meat to them.
[1525.46 → 1526.46] See, but then they've been moving away from that.
[1526.46 → 1529.46] And they've been moving away from that. So, so, okay.
[1529.46 → 1532.46] And, and like, um, there, there was Prince of Persia.
[1532.46 → 1533.46] Okay.
[1533.46 → 1537.46] But then Prince of Persia, I think, tried to be its own thing too much.
[1537.46 → 1538.46] Okay.
[1538.46 → 1542.46] And this, I think they're just going to embrace it and be like, nope, this is Warcraft.
[1542.46 → 1544.46] Well, Blizzard's good at, Blizzard's good at that.
[1544.46 → 1548.46] I mean, you know what? This was actually, uh, when I, when I was, oh man, it was awesome.
[1548.46 → 1551.46] When I was just kind of hanging out, having drinks with Chris Roberts.
[1551.46 → 1553.46] Yeah, that happened. I don't think I told you that yet.
[1553.46 → 1558.46] We haven't talked much about this. I'm like, I told you in an email, it's probably the most jelly I've ever been.
[1558.46 → 1567.46] So anyway, so he was all like, yeah, you know, I think the thing we did wrong on the Wing Commander movie was that we tried too hard to make it its own thing.
[1567.46 → 1568.46] Yeah.
[1568.46 → 1569.46] Instead of just making it.
[1569.46 → 1570.46] You just need to embrace your community.
[1570.46 → 1571.46] Making it Wing Commander.
[1571.46 → 1578.46] So if, if Blizzard does this, um, starring Colin Farrell, which is going to be, uh, this is going to be awesome.
[1578.46 → 1581.46] I have a feeling it's gonna just be all voice actors though.
[1581.46 → 1582.46] December 18th, 2015.
[1582.46 → 1583.46] I hope so.
[1583.46 → 1584.46] Um, I'll go see it.
[1584.46 → 1585.46] Yeah, me too.
[1585.46 → 1588.46] I don't think I've seen a movie on launch day since Avatar.
[1588.46 → 1594.46] And before that, oh no, I did see, uh, Deathly Hallows on launch day.
[1594.46 → 1595.46] Deathly Hallows part two.
[1595.46 → 1596.46] Return of the King?
[1596.46 → 1597.46] No.
[1597.46 → 1598.46] No, I think that was me.
[1598.46 → 1599.46] Yeah, okay.
[1599.46 → 1600.46] So that was your last one?
[1600.46 → 1601.46] I think so.
[1601.46 → 1602.46] Okay, well here, why don't we make a pact?
[1602.46 → 1603.46] Let's go see this.
[1603.46 → 1604.46] Sure.
[1604.46 → 1605.46] We'll get a big group together.
[1605.46 → 1608.46] We'll go, all the Linus, we'll have a Linus Media group outing.
[1608.46 → 1610.46] And we'll go see the Warcraft movie.
[1610.46 → 1611.46] Sweet.
[1611.46 → 1613.46] Guys, um, are you as stoked as us on this?
[1613.46 → 1619.46] I have to get the Twitch chat going on my laptop here because I am, I am, I am just, I'm sorry guys.
[1619.46 → 1620.46] I've abandoned you here.
[1620.46 → 1622.46] I just, like, yeah, seriously.
[1622.46 → 1629.46] Like, the amount of time that I've spent playing Warcraft 3 and the amount of time that I've spent playing WoW should be like, criminal.
[1629.46 → 1631.46] Are we ready for our special guest?
[1631.46 → 1636.46] I'm, I'm still waiting for the friend request, and then we'll be good to go.
[1636.46 → 1637.46] All right.
[1637.46 → 1640.46] He's jumping on right now so it shouldn't be too long.
[1640.46 → 1641.46] All right, jumping on right now.
[1641.46 → 1644.46] Why don't we go ahead and just go for our one troll news item.
[1644.46 → 1645.46] This probably won't take that long.
[1645.46 → 1648.46] I really don't think this is going to take that long.
[1648.46 → 1650.46] Half-Life 3 confirmed?
[1650.46 → 1651.46] Huh?
[1651.46 → 1652.46] Huh?
[1652.46 → 1660.46] So they registered a trademark for Half-Life 3, but it's just trademarking the name and at an almost exact same time they registered the title.
[1660.46 → 1664.46] They registered the Steam symbol in the EU.
[1664.46 → 1669.46] So, so I personally think it's just trying to drive hype towards Valve.
[1669.46 → 1684.46] I think it has nothing to do with anything and I think anyone who's reading anything into this other than they don't want someone else to make the game Half-Life 3 and be put in a position where they can't really say anything about it.
[1684.46 → 1687.46] I think that's all that's going on right now.
[1687.46 → 1688.46] Um.
[1688.46 → 1689.46] Yeah.
[1689.46 → 1690.46] Yeah.
[1690.46 → 1691.46] Yeah.
[1691.46 → 1694.46] I honestly think it, like, you're definitely right.
[1694.46 → 1699.46] I think it might have had something to do with the timing of the other stuff that's going on.
[1699.46 → 1705.46] Because it's, it drove a huge amount of more interaction to go along with their Steam Box and all this kind of stuff.
[1705.46 → 1714.46] Because even in that thread you can scroll down and see someone that posted a picture of Steam Box with the controller with Half-Life 3 bundle.
[1714.46 → 1715.46] Buy it for whatever.
[1715.46 → 1721.46] Like, like, there's, there's, it drove interaction directly for Steam Box and the other, or Steam Machine, sorry.
[1721.46 → 1723.46] And the other stuff that they're releasing.
[1723.46 → 1729.46] So, the timing may have been interesting, but they also just had to freaking patent the name.
[1729.46 → 1730.46] Because they had to.
[1730.46 → 1731.46] Right.
[1731.46 → 1733.46] Well, trademark is different from patent to be very clear.
[1733.46 → 1741.46] Um, so I, I actually do get a kick out of the fact that it's a Newman avatar on the guy, the guy who posted it on NeoGAF.
[1741.46 → 1745.46] So, yeah, yeah, the ultimate, ultimate troll avatar right there.
[1745.46 → 1746.46] How close are we here?
[1746.46 → 1748.46] I still haven't added me up.
[1748.46 → 1751.46] Um, haven't gotten an email recently.
[1751.46 → 1752.46] Alright, cool, cool, cool.
[1752.46 → 1753.46] It's probably just getting set up.
[1753.46 → 1755.46] Hopefully we'll have this going very, very soon.
[1755.46 → 1756.46] Uh, add me on Skype.
[1756.46 → 1758.46] Yep, now we're hopping on Skype in a second.
[1758.46 → 1759.46] Okay, that's good.
[1759.46 → 1761.46] So let's move along to, you know what, guys?
[1761.46 → 1764.46] Hit us with a Twitter blitz of maybe some questions for Eric.
[1764.46 → 1766.46] I'll take some time and, uh, introduce him.
[1766.46 → 1770.46] If you aren't already familiar with Eric from Tech of Tomorrow.
[1770.46 → 1773.46] He's done a wide variety of different stuff.
[1773.46 → 1776.46] Uh, started up Motherboards.org about one billion years ago.
[1776.46 → 1786.46] Without taking a crack at him for his age, uh, he's been doing the whole tech media thing for longer than I have known what a CPU is.
[1786.46 → 1788.46] So, the guy's got a ton of experience.
[1788.46 → 1794.46] His new YouTube channel, Tech of Tomorrow, is actually growing faster than Motherboards.org ever did.
[1794.46 → 1803.46] And I think it really shows, um, what creators are able to do when they shed the shackles of corporate involvement.
[1803.46 → 1808.46] Or when they aren't forced anymore to focus as much on, uh, the business side of things.
[1808.46 → 1811.46] And are instead allowed to focus on the creation side of things.
[1811.46 → 1819.46] I mean, we've seen similar success with Linus Tech Tips growing at a much faster rate than it used to be back when I had to deal with my full-time job.
[1819.46 → 1822.46] So, Tech of Tomorrow is his show.
[1822.46 → 1825.46] Uh, he's on Twitter at, uh, ooh, oh balls.
[1825.46 → 1826.46] Okay, I can't remember.
[1826.46 → 1831.46] But if you search for Tech of Tomorrow Twitter on Google, which is actually how I usually find people.
[1831.46 → 1834.46] Because Twitter does a terrible job of auto-complete.
[1834.46 → 1836.46] You know what really, really drives me insane?
[1836.46 → 1838.46] This is like, kind of offshoot.
[1838.46 → 1841.46] But when you go on Twitter and type in, there's the search box.
[1841.46 → 1843.46] And I'm like, Linus!
[1843.46 → 1846.46] And then press down once because it's currently searching for you.
[1846.46 → 1848.46] And then press enter.
[1848.46 → 1857.46] And it comes up with, instead of going to you, it just does like a search for, if I just did L-I-N-U, it would do a search for Linux.
[1857.46 → 1864.46] And it's like, no, actually I want the thing that you were showing a millisecond previously, which was Linus.
[1864.46 → 1867.46] It's, oh man, there's some stuff about Twitter that drives me crazy.
[1867.46 → 1870.46] I have recently started using Instagram.
[1870.46 → 1871.46] Really?
[1871.46 → 1873.46] Because Twitter pictures break constantly.
[1873.46 → 1874.46] You know what?
[1874.46 → 1875.46] I've actually found that too.
[1875.46 → 1879.46] There's better support when you click, especially on the mobile app.
[1879.46 → 1880.46] Yeah.
[1880.46 → 1883.46] When you click on a Twitter picture link, it just goes nowhere.
[1883.46 → 1884.46] It doesn't work.
[1884.46 → 1886.46] So now if I use Instagram, it actually loads.
[1886.46 → 1888.46] Like I have no interest in actually using Instagram.
[1888.46 → 1889.46] I used to use it a long time ago.
[1889.46 → 1891.46] I didn't even bother making a new account.
[1891.46 → 1893.46] I was just like, whatever.
[1893.46 → 1894.46] It'll work.
[1894.46 → 1896.46] And like, I don't want to promote it.
[1896.46 → 1897.46] I don't want to do anything.
[1897.46 → 1902.46] I don't care if anyone follows it because everything that I ever post on Instagram will always just push to Twitter.
[1902.46 → 1907.46] I have no interest because it's just the only reason why I'm using it is so actually freaking load.
[1907.46 → 1909.46] Alright, we've got another little bit of troll news here.
[1909.46 → 1910.46] This is pretty funny.
[1910.46 → 1912.46] Well, we stall for time some more.
[1912.46 → 1914.46] So, are we ready to rock?
[1914.46 → 1915.46] Yeah.
[1915.46 → 1916.46] We've got to get things going over there.
[1916.46 → 1917.46] We need our headsets, right?
[1917.46 → 1918.46] Yeah.
[1918.46 → 1930.46] Um, on Indiegogo, the AI smartwatch is a smartwatch that I watched their video about sort of two
[1930.46 → 1932.46] minutes in and I kind of went, yeah, okay.
[1932.46 → 1933.46] And I was like, you know what?
[1933.46 → 1938.46] The real secret to a successful Kickstarter or Indiegogo campaign seems to have less to
[1938.46 → 1942.46] do with the idea and the product and more to do with having a really slick video.
[1942.46 → 1946.46] And I was looking at it going, yeah, really guys, I don't know if, uh, I don't know if
[1946.46 → 1947.46] this is going to work.
[1947.46 → 1951.46] So, what we got a kick out of, and this was pointed out by one of our community members,
[1951.46 → 1954.46] was that it is as featured in, whoa, hold on a second.
[1954.46 → 1956.46] What's that down there?
[1956.46 → 1957.46] What's, what's this right here?
[1957.46 → 1960.46] As featured in Linus Tech Tips.
[1960.46 → 1963.46] So, Luke's looking at this going, what?
[1963.46 → 1964.46] I don't remember this.
[1964.46 → 1966.46] I don't remember making a video about this.
[1966.46 → 1971.46] You know what's funny too is I watched the video and, um, it was just, it was music
[1971.46 → 1972.46] that we paid for off Melody Loops.
[1972.46 → 1973.46] Yeah.
[1973.46 → 1978.46] But they used the same music that we use in one of our Tech Quickie videos in their Indiegogo
[1978.46 → 1979.46] video.
[1979.46 → 1980.46] I recognize that as well.
[1980.46 → 1988.46] Um, so what it turned out to actually be was a, uh, a, a post on the Linus Tech Tips forum
[1988.46 → 1991.46] that like one dude who looks like a legit member of the forum.
[1991.46 → 1992.46] He is.
[1992.46 → 1993.46] Yep.
[1993.46 → 1994.46] He definitely is.
[1994.46 → 1998.46] It's youbetornot who I've seen around like 2,000 posts saying, oh, that's pretty cool,
[1998.46 → 1999.46] but that small interface.
[1999.46 → 2001.46] And then nobody ever replied.
[2001.46 → 2002.46] And, and that-
[2002.46 → 2003.46] It was like, it's not even a bad post.
[2003.46 → 2004.46] Just no one ended up replying.
[2004.46 → 2005.46] No.
[2005.46 → 2006.46] Good post.
[2006.46 → 2012.46] Just, um, it wasn't really featured on Linus Tech Tips in the same way that Indiegogo
[2012.46 → 2016.46] page would imply that it was featured on Linus Tech Tips.
[2016.46 → 2018.46] So we're getting our call with Eric going.
[2018.46 → 2021.46] I've had the pleasure of meeting Eric a couple of times.
[2021.46 → 2025.46] The first time we met in person was at CES this year.
[2025.46 → 2031.46] And I remember us saying, hey, we have to, you know, get together and like do something.
[2031.46 → 2034.46] And then we just never managed to make it happen.
[2034.46 → 2035.46] So is he, is he on?
[2035.46 → 2036.46] Are we good?
[2036.46 → 2037.46] Are we live?
[2037.46 → 2038.46] I'm here.
[2038.46 → 2040.46] Hey, welcome to the show.
[2040.46 → 2041.46] All right.
[2041.46 → 2046.46] So I kind of introduced you a little bit, but why don't you tell the audience what you're
[2046.46 → 2051.46] about as if any of them don't know who you are already, because I'm pretty sure they do.
[2051.46 → 2052.46] I don't know, man.
[2052.46 → 2056.46] I'm like the see if I feel like the old man, the tech business, I've been doing this
[2056.46 → 2058.46] like since the day it started.
[2058.46 → 2062.46] Um, I've been into gaming and computers and electronics ever since I was a little kid.
[2062.46 → 2067.46] So like doing this for me, it just seems to be like the natural way of my life.
[2067.46 → 2071.46] I really love doing what I'm doing, and I don't really see myself doing anything else.
[2071.46 → 2074.46] And it's great to see so many other young people doing it nowadays.
[2074.46 → 2077.46] Like I've been doing it back when I was on like one or two sites.
[2077.46 → 2080.46] Now there's just so many people out there doing their own thing, and it's just awesome.
[2080.46 → 2087.46] You know, a lot of people feel like guys like you and me, or, um, you know, the new egg
[2087.46 → 2089.46] TV guys or whatever are competitors.
[2089.46 → 2092.46] And I'd like you to take a moment and address that in your own words.
[2092.46 → 2094.46] Because I think you put it pretty well.
[2094.46 → 2095.46] Yeah.
[2095.46 → 2100.46] I mean, there really is no competition between anybody.
[2100.46 → 2104.46] I'll admit that like when I first got into it, I used to kind of look around and look at
[2104.46 → 2107.46] everybody's numbers and what are, you know, what I could do to get better and all this.
[2107.46 → 2114.46] But then I just kind of just started like doing my own thing, paying attention to what I was doing and learning really to like more and less buddy up with everybody.
[2114.46 → 2118.46] Um, for a long time, it seems like a lot of the PC people all wanted to be like an island.
[2118.46 → 2122.46] They just, you know, they were afraid to share their ideas, afraid to work together.
[2122.46 → 2125.46] And I've really noticed that over the years, the Mac guys have never done that.
[2125.46 → 2133.46] And so I really myself started adopting more of their kind of outlook on things, work with everybody, work together and just be one big happy family.
[2133.46 → 2136.46] Instead of being an island all by yourself, trying to do this.
[2136.46 → 2137.46] Absolutely.
[2137.46 → 2138.46] I agree a hundred percent.
[2138.46 → 2148.46] I mean, it's, it's still kind of is funny to me when people post on my video that, you know, Eric's the best tech host, or they post on your video that Linus is the best.
[2148.46 → 2151.46] And you know what guys, we really don't see it that way.
[2151.46 → 2169.46] Uh, we see ourselves as, and this is sort of my take on it, is that I see every other YouTuber who is doing tech on YouTube or making videos on YouTube and making a living out of it as a testament to the solidity of the platform and the legitimacy of what we're doing here.
[2169.46 → 2188.46] I think every other tech YouTuber that's approaching sponsors and trying to, you know, get sponsorship or, you know, get access to the samples that we need in order to bring you guys timely content is great because it brings attention to YouTube and to video that we otherwise wouldn't be getting if it was just one dude talking about it to them.
[2188.46 → 2190.46] So I, I think it's fantastic.
[2190.46 → 2195.46] Yeah, I just think it's funny because they leave comments like, oh, hey, he did it before you or so-and-so did it before you.
[2195.46 → 2200.46] And I see those same comments on their channels when I do when they don't realize that we all are just doing our own thing.
[2200.46 → 2202.46] And when it hits, it hits.
[2202.46 → 2208.46] Speaking of things that are hitting, this was an article that is on Tech Power Up.
[2208.46 → 2214.46] Now, I don't know what your NDA obligations are, but I do have some with respect to the upcoming Radeon graphics cards.
[2214.46 → 2221.46] So I want to keep the discussion pretty much narrowed in from my side on what I've already seen posted in other places.
[2221.46 → 2234.46] But Tech Power Up posted some benchmarks of the Radeon R9 290X, which we already know this isn't under NDA, is going to be their new flagship card based on a new GPU.
[2234.46 → 2237.46] And we saw some interesting results here.
[2237.46 → 2241.46] So there's rumoured specs in here as well, but we see a trading blows with the Titan.
[2241.46 → 2245.46] So give me, give me your thoughts on Radeon 290X.
[2245.46 → 2253.46] Well, for me, I'm just really glad to see AMD getting something that's new for the people that are out there that have been supporting them.
[2253.46 → 2256.46] I mean, they've had their cards on the market for a long time.
[2256.46 → 2265.46] We did see the 7990 hit the market, but it doesn't seem like it got very favourable results since the price is like almost next to giving it away now compared to some of the cards that are coming out.
[2265.46 → 2268.46] But I'm really looking forward to it.
[2268.46 → 2281.46] And if these guys can actually get the price point down below the Titan, and even if it doesn't beat the Titan, if it can even come anywhere near the Titan and be hundreds of dollars less, fans are going to be embracing that and enjoying it and being a reviewer myself.
[2281.46 → 2286.46] And you know what it's like when you get new tech stuff, then you have shit to really talk about.
[2286.46 → 2289.46] When you're on your 10th card of your launch, you're like, okay, it's the 10th card.
[2289.46 → 2291.46] But now this is fresh.
[2291.46 → 2292.46] This is exciting.
[2292.46 → 2293.46] And I'm looking forward to it.
[2293.46 → 2296.46] And I know the AMD fans are looking forward to it as well.
[2296.46 → 2297.46] I'm super stoked.
[2297.46 → 2301.46] And to bring in the pricing thing, New egg had their little Shiva going on.
[2301.46 → 2303.46] Yes, there was a little snafu on New egg.
[2303.46 → 2305.46] I don't know if you saw this or not, but go ahead.
[2305.46 → 2307.46] So they had a pre-order listed.
[2307.46 → 2310.46] And whenever this happens, there's always that dude.
[2310.46 → 2311.46] Yeah.
[2311.46 → 2317.46] That decides to go check out the code for the forum or web page or whatever it is.
[2317.46 → 2321.46] There's always that dude that goes and finds whatever that isn't supposed to be there.
[2321.46 → 2322.46] So $700 plus.
[2322.46 → 2326.46] But then they could pull a switcheroo like has happened in the past.
[2326.46 → 2333.46] Nvidia did it with GTX 680 where pricing was going to be $699 and launch day, boom, it was $599.
[2333.46 → 2341.46] So they shocked everyone from AMD to their retailers to their partners with a much more aggressively priced part than we were expecting.
[2341.46 → 2348.46] Based on what we've seen from the leaked benchmarks on Tech Power Up, performance looks very close to the Titan.
[2348.46 → 2353.46] However, I would take these results with a ginormous grain of salt.
[2353.46 → 2354.46] Grain of salt.
[2354.46 → 2355.46] Yes.
[2355.46 → 2357.46] Not only because it's pre-release, but I mean, come on.
[2357.46 → 2358.46] Okay.
[2358.46 → 2366.46] Eric, how many times have you run surround benchmarks only to discover that it is a freaking nightmare?
[2366.46 → 2367.46] Yeah.
[2367.46 → 2369.46] It's most of the time just getting the setup on it to pay in the butt.
[2369.46 → 2370.46] You can get it done.
[2370.46 → 2373.46] But those numbers to me are a little bit questionable right out of the gate.
[2373.46 → 2375.46] I'm waiting until we really see what goes on with it.
[2375.46 → 2380.46] I mean, now, now I really do think though, the card is going to be very, very competitive.
[2380.46 → 2385.46] AMD wouldn't have held their cards so close to their sleeve if they didn't have something that was going to come out to compete.
[2385.46 → 2388.46] And these guys are known to be the price competitors.
[2388.46 → 2394.46] So if they just play their cards right, AMD can do serious damage to the market, especially here around the holiday season.
[2394.46 → 2396.46] Oh, play their cards.
[2396.46 → 2398.46] Oh, hey, oh.
[2398.46 → 2399.46] That's all right, man.
[2399.46 → 2400.46] I love that.
[2400.46 → 2401.46] I didn't catch that one.
[2401.46 → 2402.46] What happened there, guys?
[2402.46 → 2403.46] You sound like you fell off the planet.
[2403.46 → 2404.46] Did you guys fall over?
[2404.46 → 2407.46] No, I was just laughing.
[2407.46 → 2408.46] I love that.
[2408.46 → 2409.46] Play your cards right.
[2409.46 → 2411.46] Ah, that's fantastic.
[2411.46 → 2414.46] So, rumoured specs has the die size...
[2414.46 → 2416.46] It was a double whammy.
[2416.46 → 2423.46] Rumoured specs have the die size of the 290X at higher than the 7970.
[2423.46 → 2442.46] Now, we saw AMD revise their strategy significantly with the release of the 3870, where Nvidia remained committed to the gigantic, monolithic GPU that was extremely expensive to engineer, produced a lot of heat, and was extremely expensive to build and put on cards.
[2442.46 → 2447.46] When AMD said, no, our strategy is going to be multi GPU for the future.
[2447.46 → 2453.46] We're going to build smaller GPUs and our flagship part will always be two of them together.
[2453.46 → 2464.46] Do you see a larger die than what we saw on Cayman XT, which was the 7970, 7950 series, as a departure from that strategy?
[2464.46 → 2465.46] And what does this mean?
[2465.46 → 2470.46] To be honest with you, Linus, during a lot of that last thing, I couldn't hear most of it.
[2470.46 → 2472.46] I'm sorry if I'm trying to apologize, everybody.
[2472.46 → 2473.46] Can you re-say a lot of it?
[2473.46 → 2474.46] Because I couldn't hear you guys.
[2474.46 → 2476.46] It broke up terrible on the Skype connection.
[2476.46 → 2477.46] Oh, shoot.
[2477.46 → 2478.46] Sorry about that.
[2478.46 → 2479.46] Okay.
[2479.46 → 2486.46] So, do you see AMD's new GPU, which is rumoured to be much larger than the 7970 GPU in terms of die area?
[2486.46 → 2501.46] Do you see that as an admission of defeat on their strategy of having two smaller GPUs, so 3870X2, 4870X2, two smaller GPUs together make up their high-end strategy?
[2501.46 → 2511.46] I think that AMD's just trying to stick to what they know best and trying to, like, get the technology to be smaller and smaller and smaller always causes some type of problems.
[2511.46 → 2520.46] These guys right now really just wanted to get a cards and cards out there that could seriously compete with NVIDIA since we guys all know the Titans so far just suck the market up.
[2520.46 → 2524.46] So, I think AMD's just trying to really stick to what they know right now.
[2524.46 → 2528.46] I think in launches that we see next year with new stuff, we'll see them go back to that again.
[2528.46 → 2531.46] But I think right now they're just trying to really stick with what they know.
[2531.46 → 2533.46] Yep.
[2533.46 → 2534.46] I agree.
[2534.46 → 2535.46] I agree 100%.
[2535.46 → 2541.46] Now, I wanted to move on to this as a separate topic, but I guess this segues in really, really well.
[2541.46 → 2546.46] Do you feel like NVIDIA has been holding back for the last two years?
[2547.46 → 2549.46] Yes, for a fact.
[2549.46 → 2552.46] I mean, everybody that I see at NVIDIA is constantly on vacation.
[2552.46 → 2554.46] Like, you guys all know Del Rizzo.
[2554.46 → 2558.46] Every time I see him, he's on vacation with his husband around the world sending me a postcard saying,
[2558.46 → 2559.46] Hey, we love the world.
[2559.46 → 2566.46] If the company really wanted to be that competitive, I think we'd be seeing these guys doing a lot more launching and a lot more talking about their product.
[2566.46 → 2572.46] They seem to be right now in cruise control, just kicking back and waiting to see what AMD's move is.
[2572.46 → 2574.46] Now, of course, sorry, go ahead.
[2574.46 → 2576.46] We called this out like a while ago.
[2576.46 → 2583.46] Actually, we've called this out repeatedly because we just we've we've known they've been sitting on this chip for so long.
[2583.46 → 2586.46] Just going, oh, here's another little bit.
[2586.46 → 2587.46] That's all you need.
[2587.46 → 2588.46] Don't worry about it.
[2588.46 → 2589.46] They're just kind of sitting there.
[2589.46 → 2594.46] So for those of you who aren't familiar with the history, GTX Titan or GK 110 is the code name.
[2594.46 → 2597.46] It's the same GPU that's in GTX 780.
[2597.46 → 2603.46] The rumour was that that was always supposed to be the successor to the GTX 580.
[2603.46 → 2606.46] That was supposed to be the GTX 680.
[2606.46 → 2613.46] But the rumour, the word on the street is that Nvidia saw how poorly 7970 performed.
[2613.46 → 2623.46] And remember, this was AMD strategy of smaller cores and then putting two of them together for the high end, which they didn't even manage to do until a year plus into that product launch.
[2623.46 → 2631.46] So when Nvidia saw how poorly it performed, they basically went, well, we don't even have to release this as a GeForce GPU.
[2631.46 → 2645.46] And they took what would have been GTX 660 Ti, GTX 660 class of product, the GK 104 GPU and turn that into their high-end product and basically sat on GK 110.
[2645.46 → 2652.46] You know, deployed it in super computing applications, Tesla.
[2652.46 → 2669.46] And so basically the rumour is that had AMD managed to release something like R9 290X, you know, a year and a half ago, we wouldn't have seen a thousand dollar GTX Titan.
[2669.46 → 2672.46] Yeah, I agree with you 100%.
[2672.46 → 2677.64] Nvidia's had no reason to come back up and swing, and it really wouldn't make much sense for them either.
[2677.72 → 2683.94] If they came out with some card now that was super, superfast, they would put their competitor almost completely out of business.
[2683.94 → 2685.62] And that really wouldn't make sense for them either.
[2685.70 → 2687.48] They don't really want AMD to go anywhere.
[2687.88 → 2688.78] They just want to beat them.
[2688.88 → 2689.78] And they're doing that.
[2689.88 → 2691.02] And they don't have to do much.
[2691.06 → 2695.84] Like I said before, these guys would not be out on vacation and doing everything if they wanted to compete.
[2695.84 → 2700.58] They'd be in the lab talking to their engineers and talking to all of us about something new.
[2700.70 → 2703.92] I don't know about you folks, but I haven't heard about anything crazily new coming out.
[2704.32 → 2716.80] And the thing about, I mean, the thing that the viewers need to understand, because, you know, viewers, a lot of the time I feel like don't understand the market dynamics as well as they would if they were part of the industry.
[2716.80 → 2727.72] So the things that viewers need to understand is that it costs a certain amount to make a card, whether it's to engineer a new chip or put a complicated VRM design on it or a heat sink.
[2727.82 → 2734.28] I mean, the heat sink on GTX 780, GTX Titan costs, I think, something in the neighbourhood of $70 to $80.
[2734.86 → 2737.26] That's a bomb cost on that heat sink.
[2737.34 → 2740.14] It's extremely expensive to produce something like that.
[2740.32 → 2743.32] So there is an actual cost to producing graphics cards.
[2743.94 → 2745.54] But Linus, it looks good, Ben.
[2745.54 → 2747.18] It does look good, and I love it.
[2747.72 → 2750.06] I mean, everybody likes reference cards from those guys.
[2750.14 → 2755.06] For the first time ever, NVIDIA made reference cards that people actually wanted more than other cards.
[2755.22 → 2757.32] That's a different change for those guys for sure, though.
[2757.50 → 2763.86] So the perception from consumers that more competition just drives pricing down is actually wrong.
[2764.18 → 2775.30] More competition drives a product out of the market, potentially, if it costs too much to continue to make it versus how much they can actually sell it for compared to everything else that's out there.
[2775.30 → 2789.58] So if NVIDIA turned around and released Maxwell Tomorrow, which is their upcoming architecture, and it was twice as fast as the R9 series, it's not like they could charge, you know, $1,500 or $2,000 for the top-end card.
[2789.58 → 2797.22] It might be lucrative in terms of the profit margin on the card, but it wouldn't be lucrative in terms of the volume they could turn.
[2797.22 → 2814.52] So it's a balancing act where AMD and NVIDIA are constantly playing this game where they actually carefully, unless they do something crazy like 8800GT, they actually carefully slot in a new card so that it performs about like the old ones except a slightly better value, and it makes sense.
[2814.52 → 2817.64] We very rarely see the market completely upset these days.
[2817.84 → 2832.26] So from a business standpoint, if you can't get as much for your card because people just don't have that much money as it would be worth compared to everything else that's in the market and what your competitor can deliver, why do you release something new?
[2832.26 → 2837.92] Yeah, for NVIDIA, there's really no reason at all for them to release any new product right now.
[2838.02 → 2849.06] They can kind of cruise even if this card comes out, and it's really close, they can still say in the long run, hey, our card's faster, we're going to charge that money, and they can wait another generation to launch their cards.
[2849.20 → 2855.80] Plus, from what we've heard, they do have two more cards that are possibly going to be coming out, so we may see something new from them very soon.
[2855.94 → 2859.36] Why don't you give the details on those cards because we haven't talked about them at all. Hit us.
[2859.36 → 2866.64] Well, there's supposed to be a single GPU card coming out and another dual GPU card coming out from NVIDIA.
[2867.06 → 2875.26] The rumours are flying. There's nothing concrete that I've actually heard from them directly, but we've seen the leaks around the world, so we know that something's definitely going to be coming.
[2875.62 → 2878.28] All these guys are doing right now is sitting back once again.
[2878.62 → 2882.58] They're going to wait for the launch. They're going to see how it affects them, and then they'll make a decision.
[2882.58 → 2893.10] If there's nothing that they need to do, they're going to even hold back on releasing any new cards until probably we may see something right at the holiday season, but if not, it'll be in Q1 of 2014.
[2893.10 → 2896.74] So, I actually just linked to your article here.
[2896.88 → 2899.82] So, guys, this is on techoftomorrow.com, and the article is,
[2899.92 → 2903.94] NVIDIA cutting video card prices in October to compete with AMD with a question mark on it.
[2904.22 → 2906.54] You know, allegedly, you know, humouredly.
[2907.20 → 2907.68] Rumour.
[2907.90 → 2908.30] Rumour.
[2908.34 → 2909.10] That question mark.
[2909.10 → 2913.20] Where Eric basically says, well, look, we might see a full-fledged Titan.
[2913.50 → 2918.64] Not all the SMX modules and CUBA cores are enabled on the GTX Titan right now.
[2918.86 → 2928.92] We might also see, and this has been rumoured by NVIDIA themselves, a dual GK110 GPU, which would be absolutely benchmark crushing.
[2929.80 → 2930.06] I mean...
[2930.06 → 2930.90] I'd love to see it.
[2931.16 → 2932.22] I'd love to see it.
[2932.22 → 2938.04] With that said, for all the viewers that are kind of about to ask me and about to hit my PM inbox,
[2938.34 → 2939.78] Linus, how do you think it will perform?
[2940.10 → 2941.58] The answer is very simple.
[2942.28 → 2942.88] It'll perform...
[2942.88 → 2942.92] Fast.
[2943.56 → 2944.04] Fast.
[2944.42 → 2948.40] Just like two GK110s in SLI on separate cards.
[2948.56 → 2949.56] Pretty much like that.
[2949.80 → 2953.60] So, there's not a lot of special sauce to go on here.
[2954.34 → 2958.92] Yeah, but NVIDIA has actually contacted me and said, hey, you know, get ready to have these cards.
[2958.92 → 2961.18] So, they might be something that they have on paper.
[2961.18 → 2966.76] They might even have them, but they're not yet really sharing them with the market and saying, hey, these cards are for sure coming.
[2967.00 → 2969.34] Because, believe me, as soon as they do, you know, we'll know.
[2969.56 → 2976.22] Well, NVIDIA used to be pure, you know, consumer graphics cards.
[2976.58 → 2984.82] Whereas, you look at some of their initiatives now, something like Grid already uses dual GK110 GPUs on a single PCB.
[2984.82 → 2996.88] So, NVIDIA has become, and you look at Titan, same thing, become more about delivering an enterprise solution and trickling that technology down to the consumer, which is a reversal from what we saw from them before.
[2996.88 → 3002.66] So, I wouldn't be surprised if they are just sitting there waiting for AMD to do something.
[3003.16 → 3012.58] And they just, you know, get a consumer-friendly looking heat sink and redesign the I.O. to actually have some ports on it and release something along the lines of that card.
[3012.58 → 3019.66] Now, did you guys hear that all the 280X cards that are coming out, they're not any reference models whatsoever?
[3019.98 → 3023.52] I'm hearing that every card is supposed to have its own coolant from the company.
[3023.62 → 3031.02] So, instead of using a card with a sticker on it, I'm hearing that all the new 280X cards will be specifically designed by the company that's making them.
[3031.40 → 3032.28] You guys heard that as well?
[3032.28 → 3042.62] I hadn't heard that, but I do know that our sample 290X is a non-reference card, and I haven't heard of anyone who has gotten a reference card.
[3042.78 → 3052.08] So, while AMD did have reference cards at the event in Hawaii, I haven't seen any yet, so that could very well be true.
[3052.34 → 3059.48] With that said, you know, maybe this is a good opportunity to talk about what do you think of reference cards versus non-reference cards?
[3059.48 → 3062.68] Because this is a question that we get a ton of.
[3063.54 → 3071.70] I think it really matters on, like, who is making the reference card, because a company will take a reference card and...
[3071.70 → 3072.56] Sorry to interject.
[3072.62 → 3078.22] Sorry to interrupt. We're getting some breaking up on the call here. Can we try redialling you here?
[3080.04 → 3081.36] Let's try that one more time here.
[3081.72 → 3086.12] Sorry, guys. Our connection looks good. The stream seems to be running just fine still.
[3086.92 → 3088.12] I was going for a minute.
[3088.12 → 3095.92] Just to be clear, guys, we still have our Razor Lower Third down here, but the Razor comes sponsorship is technically over,
[3096.12 → 3100.90] and Eric had Skype on his machine, so we decided to go that route. So, you're back, right?
[3101.42 → 3101.94] I'm here.
[3103.18 → 3107.12] But you still got that robot sound. I wonder what's going on here.
[3107.20 → 3111.32] It sounds like you might be being DDoSed, actually, would be my suspicion.
[3111.32 → 3117.16] My comes broke. That's actually why I didn't use it.
[3117.38 → 3119.84] But I can try and see if things are actually working.
[3119.84 → 3127.64] Yeah, I think you might be being DDoSed. So, do you happen...
[3127.64 → 3131.72] Hmm. Okay, let's see if we can figure out what we can do here.
[3131.74 → 3133.42] Yeah, comes isn't actually... Oh, there we go.
[3133.92 → 3137.38] Hold on. Have we got... Has the connection dropped completely?
[3138.14 → 3139.08] No, we can hear him.
[3139.08 → 3141.08] Still there. Okay, well...
[3141.08 → 3141.44] I'm here.
[3141.94 → 3146.78] You know what? Why don't you go ahead and sort of...? We'll see if we can power through it and give us a...
[3146.78 → 3150.00] You know what would be... How good of a data plan do you have on your phone?
[3150.20 → 3154.34] Do you want to give us a call from your phone on a mobile network and see if we can avoid this?
[3157.08 → 3161.84] I suppose. I'm in my house. I thought this was a good connection.
[3161.84 → 3165.54] And they say that I'm being DDoSed or something.
[3167.10 → 3171.70] Yeah, it's a Skype bug. There's really not a lot that can be done about it.
[3171.74 → 3177.28] But anyone who knows your Skype ID is able to DDoS you with impunity.
[3177.46 → 3182.30] It was a problem we were running into on the WAN show where our shows were getting shut down
[3182.30 → 3185.96] because someone who knew our Skype ID was shutting us down.
[3186.06 → 3190.40] In fact, that person's probably trying to DDoS us right now.
[3190.40 → 3194.30] But don't worry. We're using a very secret Skype ID that gets used for nothing but this.
[3194.64 → 3196.40] So, you know...
[3196.92 → 3198.24] So I've been hacked.
[3199.96 → 3200.78] Basically, yeah.
[3201.58 → 3203.86] So you guys want me to try to hang up this and then call you back?
[3204.02 → 3204.44] You know what?
[3204.44 → 3205.10] Is that what you're saying?
[3205.62 → 3206.74] It's a little bit better now.
[3206.92 → 3210.28] Why don't you give us the reference versus non-reference card bit and let's...
[3210.28 → 3210.62] All right, let's try it.
[3210.70 → 3212.22] Let's try it. Let's see if you can make it.
[3212.94 → 3214.26] All right. So check it out. Here's my way.
[3214.40 → 3216.40] Now, the past...
[3216.98 → 3217.80] Are you guys still there?
[3218.00 → 3218.34] Oh, yeah.
[3218.34 → 3224.00] Okay. In the past, I thought NVIDIA made some of the worst reference coolers around.
[3224.10 → 3226.66] You guys all know. Everybody called them lawnmowers and everything else.
[3226.76 → 3228.16] They were super, super loud.
[3228.26 → 3230.06] In fact, everybody kind of suffered from it.
[3230.24 → 3232.50] Do you remember the 7950 GX2?
[3234.70 → 3236.54] How could you not?
[3236.54 → 3243.56] But like I was saying, man, NVIDIA now makes a reference card that has a really nice cooler on it.
[3243.74 → 3249.52] And many of the people in my channel will come to me and say, hey, how do you get a hold of that reference design exactly like that?
[3249.66 → 3251.18] And that time, it was really cool.
[3251.18 → 3261.18] But most of the time, when companies just take and put a piece of plastic on it and throw a sticker on it, I mean, I suppose that it's okay if you're just somebody throwing it in a computer and not looking at it.
[3261.36 → 3263.18] But most of the people, I think, nowadays, they're getting...
[3263.18 → 3271.44] Oh, boy. Yeah. No, he's definitely, definitely being DDoSed.
[3271.48 → 3273.42] So maybe try and bring the connection back.
[3273.68 → 3277.20] In the meantime, guys, I would love for you to hit us up on Twitter.
[3277.58 → 3282.74] Give us a Twitter blitz of any questions you have for Eric that you'd like him to address live on the screen.
[3285.12 → 3285.64] All right.
[3285.72 → 3289.76] So let's go ahead and move into one of our other topics while we try and get Eric back.
[3289.76 → 3294.12] I've got someone asking me on Twitter, do you even know what DDoS is?
[3294.22 → 3295.82] It's just Skype being garbage.
[3296.22 → 3300.26] The reality of it is Skype's service really just isn't actually that bad.
[3300.88 → 3303.52] And, yeah, it's probably not that.
[3303.60 → 3304.84] So do we have you back? Are you back?
[3305.30 → 3308.36] I am here. I don't know how much you guys got, but I'm here.
[3309.14 → 3310.02] All right. You're back.
[3310.14 → 3317.90] So we made it to you don't see much of a value to board partners just taking a reference design and slapping a sticker on it
[3317.90 → 3320.16] versus actually designing their own card.
[3321.12 → 3323.66] Most of the time, I don't really think that's good because, I mean,
[3323.94 → 3328.26] unless you're just somebody who doesn't care about your computer, and you just want to throw it in there and play some games,
[3328.52 → 3330.26] you want a card that's going to look good.
[3330.30 → 3332.60] It's going to be cool, going to have overclocking and all that stuff.
[3332.68 → 3337.10] And when these guys go out of their way, and they make Wind force, Twinflower, ASICS,
[3337.50 → 3340.08] when they make this extra coolie and go that extra mile,
[3340.18 → 3343.56] it just seems to make the card be a better card and look better.
[3343.56 → 3349.68] And for the $5 or $10 that should pay a difference, I think the people who take the time to do that are making a better card.
[3349.94 → 3353.08] Now, there are some people, however, who have contacted me, like I said,
[3353.14 → 3358.38] who they really want to get their hands on the reference cards just like they look from NVIDIA.
[3358.62 → 3360.42] You can get those, obviously, from EGA.
[3360.58 → 3361.30] They have those.
[3361.76 → 3366.48] But there are still some people that just made a plastic shroud even for some of these newer cards.
[3366.66 → 3368.14] And I don't really appreciate that.
[3368.20 → 3371.34] I think it's better if you go out of your way and take the time to make a better card.
[3371.48 → 3372.68] You're not the reference guy.
[3372.68 → 3374.20] Take the time to make a good card.
[3374.36 → 3374.78] Yep.
[3374.88 → 3375.32] You know what?
[3375.40 → 3379.02] I agree with you 100% because there was a time a few years ago
[3379.02 → 3383.16] when you were looking at paying a lot of the time for a non-reference card
[3383.16 → 3386.96] as much as you would pay for the next better GPU.
[3387.30 → 3391.94] So we were getting, you know, redesigned cards that are a lower tier of product
[3391.94 → 3395.16] and then we were getting them sold to us at the price of a higher tier of product
[3395.16 → 3398.48] with performance that was about the same, but they'd be overclocked already.
[3398.62 → 3400.30] And yeah, you'd have a little bit more headroom out of them,
[3400.30 → 3403.90] but usually you were better off just buying a better GPU in the first place.
[3403.98 → 3407.50] Whereas now, it's like you said, it usually costs like what?
[3407.52 → 3411.30] An extra 10 bucks, 15 bucks to get something like a Direct CU 2
[3411.30 → 3416.32] or a Wind force or a Twin Frozen card that has better cooling.
[3416.58 → 3418.50] And in the case of Direct CU 2 in particular,
[3418.50 → 3424.48] ASUS has done a great job of having completely non-reference redesigned cards ready
[3424.48 → 3426.80] at launch a lot of the time.
[3426.92 → 3429.92] So I think there's a very compelling value to be had there.
[3430.38 → 3431.90] The only case...
[3431.90 → 3432.44] It takes a lot of time.
[3433.18 → 3435.94] But ASUS will take a lot of time to make your card.
[3436.18 → 3439.08] Sorry, we can't make you out again.
[3439.08 → 3441.42] But you know what?
[3441.48 → 3447.00] I think we're getting some complaints here on the stream
[3447.00 → 3449.04] about just how bad the voice quality is.
[3449.12 → 3449.42] You know what?
[3449.46 → 3449.84] I'm sorry.
[3449.92 → 3451.40] We might have to let you go, Eric.
[3452.56 → 3454.32] Is he still able to hear me?
[3454.50 → 3455.30] Probably not.
[3455.60 → 3456.54] He can hear us fine.
[3457.54 → 3457.84] Yeah.
[3458.02 → 3459.12] I hear you guys fine.
[3459.22 → 3459.46] Sorry.
[3460.10 → 3461.18] You're breaking up too bad.
[3461.30 → 3461.94] So you know what?
[3462.16 → 3465.14] Thank you so much for coming on as a guest.
[3465.14 → 3467.62] Since they can't really hear you,
[3467.80 → 3471.50] I guess what I'll have to do is just kind of do your outro for you.
[3472.32 → 3474.08] Hey, I hope you can hear that.
[3474.84 → 3475.66] See the poll, guys.
[3475.96 → 3477.18] And the game.
[3477.98 → 3478.74] We're showing you.
[3478.88 → 3480.62] We can get the fans in the...
[3480.62 → 3482.72] Sorry, man.
[3482.80 → 3483.52] We got nothing.
[3483.74 → 3485.06] You're going to have to...
[3485.06 → 3485.30] Let's do it.
[3485.34 → 3485.48] Yeah.
[3485.84 → 3487.52] I'll cut it, but do an outro for him.
[3487.52 → 3487.72] Yeah.
[3487.86 → 3488.10] Okay.
[3488.20 → 3490.80] So guys, just so you know, that's Eric.
[3490.90 → 3494.44] He's got over 200,000 subscribers on the YouTube's,
[3494.44 → 3496.12] which is all the more impressive
[3496.12 → 3499.44] because he had to restart his channel.
[3499.54 → 3501.84] He got a lot of support from his viewers,
[3502.06 → 3505.08] formerly on the YouTube.com slash Motherboards.org channel.
[3505.26 → 3506.72] They have flocked over there.
[3506.80 → 3508.02] They have helped spread the word.
[3508.18 → 3511.16] And it is now at the point where Tech of Tomorrow
[3511.16 → 3515.50] has more subscribers than the Motherboards.org channel ever had.
[3515.50 → 3517.72] And he has definitely...
[3517.72 → 3519.62] He's got faster growth than ever before.
[3520.06 → 3522.90] And I think it's a really cool...
[3522.90 → 3524.52] I think it's a really cool example
[3524.52 → 3528.96] of how YouTubers can basically come back
[3528.96 → 3530.74] and with the support of their communities
[3530.74 → 3532.80] can really make a go of it
[3532.80 → 3535.06] in spite of some really challenging stuff
[3535.06 → 3537.38] that happened quite a few months ago.
[3537.46 → 3540.40] It must have been about 10 months ago now to Eric.
[3540.48 → 3541.72] Yeah, it was because it was right around the time
[3541.72 → 3542.52] that we went indie.
[3542.88 → 3546.28] So guys, you can follow him at Tech Tomorrow on YouTube
[3546.28 → 3549.24] or you can go over to TechOfTomorrow.com
[3549.24 → 3551.14] and check him out.
[3551.68 → 3556.34] So parents, Minecraft is apparently a big problem.
[3556.84 → 3558.64] So this was a post on Kodak,
[3559.38 → 3562.70] which I mean, oh, come on.
[3562.80 → 3565.42] Okay, so now we've heard it all.
[3565.66 → 3568.80] Minecraft blamed in school violence case.
[3568.80 → 3574.40] It should be noted that the kid took an unloaded gun to school.
[3574.70 → 3575.82] There was no...
[3575.82 → 3578.96] To give a little bit to the guy who's an idiot,
[3579.18 → 3580.70] there was no firing pin in the gun.
[3580.90 → 3584.50] The kid should not have been able to get a pistol with a...
[3584.50 → 3585.32] Yes.
[3585.32 → 3585.98] ...with ammo,
[3586.20 → 3588.72] but there at least was no firing pin.
[3588.74 → 3590.00] So there was no firing pin.
[3590.08 → 3592.40] However, the kid did have a steak knife
[3592.40 → 3594.68] and a small handled sledgehammer.
[3594.68 → 3599.84] So arguably, as far as things that we'd consider to be weapons go,
[3600.14 → 3601.50] the only one was a gun.
[3602.14 → 3605.76] And then as far as things that we'd consider to be functional weapons go,
[3605.90 → 3607.46] the sledgehammer and the knife
[3607.46 → 3610.32] are probably actually the most potent out of everything.
[3610.44 → 3611.48] With that said,
[3611.82 → 3614.10] threatening with a gun is a very big deal,
[3614.10 → 3619.38] but the kid never actually threatened anyone.
[3619.38 → 3619.80] Yeah.
[3619.96 → 3621.28] So he had them at school,
[3621.38 → 3622.06] which is terrible,
[3622.28 → 3624.30] and the kid basically says...
[3624.30 → 3629.06] Well, they use hammers to dig
[3629.06 → 3632.28] and knives and guns to protect themselves from zombies.
[3632.62 → 3633.88] This was the...
[3633.88 → 3634.80] Not the kid.
[3634.94 → 3635.96] Yeah, this was the...
[3635.96 → 3636.34] Wait, what?
[3636.48 → 3637.94] I'm pretty sure that was the dad, was it not?
[3638.00 → 3638.76] Yeah, that was the dad.
[3638.86 → 3638.98] Yeah.
[3639.16 → 3639.84] So I thought...
[3639.84 → 3641.86] Oh, I thought you were saying that that was the radio station.
[3641.98 → 3643.46] So when the dad was interviewed,
[3643.88 → 3646.76] he clearly didn't have a very clear understanding
[3646.76 → 3648.84] of how Minecraft works,
[3648.90 → 3651.84] because digging is normally done with a shovel,
[3652.50 → 3655.44] and mining is done with a pickaxe.
[3655.50 → 3657.60] Or he doesn't understand how digging and mining work,
[3657.76 → 3659.64] because I don't know anyone who digs or mines with it.
[3659.78 → 3662.42] So, I mean, really what this calls into question
[3662.42 → 3668.72] is the comprehension of situations.
[3668.96 → 3669.96] He's trying...
[3669.96 → 3671.84] He took his situation,
[3671.96 → 3672.64] he sat there and went,
[3672.76 → 3675.70] okay, everything that went wrong was kind of my fault.
[3675.70 → 3679.70] Now, what is applicable that I can throw poo at
[3679.70 → 3681.86] to make this look bad instead of me,
[3682.14 → 3683.30] and just randomly was like,
[3683.36 → 3684.62] he plays Vida games.
[3684.70 → 3686.00] Everyone blames Vida games.
[3686.08 → 3687.20] I'm going to blame Vida games.
[3687.38 → 3689.68] And, I mean, I personally, you know,
[3689.74 → 3690.82] as a parent now,
[3691.02 → 3693.82] do I think that something like Grand Theft Auto V
[3693.82 → 3695.38] is something that I want my kid playing?
[3695.50 → 3696.08] The answer's no.
[3696.20 → 3697.84] I was going to say, hopefully no.
[3697.90 → 3698.56] The answer's no.
[3698.64 → 3699.32] And you know what?
[3699.40 → 3700.20] I don't even...
[3700.20 → 3701.98] I'm not even of the mind that, you know,
[3701.98 → 3704.44] at 16 or 18 necessarily
[3704.44 → 3707.78] that people should be influenced
[3707.78 → 3709.12] by that kind of media.
[3709.48 → 3710.28] With that said,
[3710.56 → 3711.98] there's worse out there
[3711.98 → 3713.56] that isn't in a video game.
[3713.84 → 3714.80] This much is true.
[3715.08 → 3716.10] And with that said,
[3716.16 → 3717.38] I'm a pretty firm believer
[3717.38 → 3719.66] in the whole nurture versus nature,
[3719.98 → 3722.00] and I lean more towards the nature side.
[3722.26 → 3724.94] Do I believe that playing a violent video game
[3724.94 → 3727.46] takes an otherwise fuzzy, warm,
[3727.60 → 3728.84] would-never-hurt-a-fly person
[3728.84 → 3730.22] and turns them into a serial killer?
[3730.40 → 3731.34] The answer is no.
[3731.62 → 3733.86] Do I think that some desensitization goes on?
[3733.94 → 3734.72] The answer's yes,
[3734.86 → 3736.52] and you're basically wrong
[3736.52 → 3739.40] if you don't think that desensitization is a thing.
[3739.50 → 3741.98] But desensitization also doesn't make you do anything.
[3742.24 → 3742.40] Right.
[3742.40 → 3744.64] It just makes you not necessarily react in crazy ways.
[3744.78 → 3747.20] So the one thing that does bother me
[3747.20 → 3750.62] is I do think that there is probably, potentially,
[3750.90 → 3752.94] and I'm putting a lot of stuff in here...
[3752.94 → 3754.30] Probably, maybe, potentially.
[3754.30 → 3757.18] I think that if you lean that way in the first place,
[3757.48 → 3760.38] you might get a few interesting, cool ideas
[3760.38 → 3762.64] that you could go ahead and act on
[3762.64 → 3764.74] that you might not have otherwise thought of.
[3764.78 → 3766.26] But not really from Minecraft.
[3766.62 → 3767.72] No, not from Minecraft.
[3767.98 → 3768.70] That's ridiculous.
[3768.80 → 3770.12] Nothing, like a sword,
[3770.30 → 3772.44] and my thing was like a sword and a bow and arrow,
[3772.44 → 3775.38] if you can translate his whatever the heck that he brought up.
[3775.70 → 3778.74] What kid didn't carve their toast into a sword
[3778.74 → 3780.34] and sword fight with their brother?
[3780.60 → 3781.20] A hundred percent.
[3781.20 → 3784.16] What kid doesn't go to camp and sharpen the end of a stick
[3784.16 → 3785.76] and like poke random things?
[3785.76 → 3786.94] You know, sword fights.
[3786.94 → 3787.56] Or whatever.
[3787.94 → 3789.10] Like, you're a kid.
[3789.18 → 3789.38] Yeah.
[3789.92 → 3791.12] Like, come on.
[3791.46 → 3792.26] So...
[3792.26 → 3796.14] Any media, any book you've like ever read, ever,
[3796.60 → 3797.40] has some sort of...
[3797.40 → 3799.86] There are the mice, whatever that book was called,
[3799.92 → 3801.96] but the mice have little swords and shields and stuff.
[3802.16 → 3803.14] Like, it's just...
[3803.14 → 3804.72] I think it's like Red wall or whatever.
[3804.72 → 3805.02] Yeah.
[3805.10 → 3805.64] That series.
[3805.76 → 3805.96] Yeah.
[3805.96 → 3807.08] Like, it's just...
[3807.08 → 3809.28] Anyway, this doesn't deserve any more of our attention.
[3809.44 → 3810.90] Let's move on to...
[3810.90 → 3812.34] Ah, yeah.
[3813.00 → 3814.40] This surprised the crap out of me.
[3814.44 → 3815.58] I can't believe they're shipping Titans.
[3815.92 → 3820.10] I had no idea that this was the approach Valve was going to take.
[3820.10 → 3825.32] So they're talking about the prototypes that they're going to send out 300 of
[3825.32 → 3828.32] to lucky folks who...
[3828.32 → 3829.56] Potentially very lucky.
[3829.60 → 3834.24] Potentially very lucky folks who apply to participate in the prototype test
[3834.24 → 3839.42] of Steam's Steam Box gaming console that's going to have the Steam OS on it.
[3839.90 → 3840.84] And there are...
[3840.84 → 3841.12] Okay.
[3841.12 → 3844.52] So the 300 prototype units will ship with the following components.
[3846.04 → 3848.34] Some will have NVIDIA Titans.
[3849.48 → 3851.52] Some will have GTX 780s.
[3851.70 → 3853.24] Some 760s.
[3853.32 → 3854.54] And some 660s.
[3854.66 → 3856.68] So we're talking mid-range to high-end GPUs.
[3856.80 → 3860.12] I was really expecting Steam Box to be more of a value-oriented...
[3860.66 → 3864.36] Remember, though, what I brought up last week is that Valve,
[3864.86 → 3866.26] the Steam Box from Valve,
[3866.34 → 3867.84] if you buy a Steam Box from Valve,
[3867.90 → 3869.64] it's going to be heavily customizable.
[3869.64 → 3872.16] So it's going to be a desktop PC.
[3872.84 → 3874.46] And it's going to come with baller hardware.
[3874.62 → 3875.54] That's been the idea.
[3875.90 → 3883.20] Then everyone else will have size or value, like price or aesthetic.
[3883.20 → 3883.90] Low power consumption.
[3884.12 → 3885.02] Or low power consumption.
[3885.18 → 3885.32] Sure.
[3885.42 → 3885.84] That kind of stuff.
[3885.92 → 3887.86] Valve is going for the beast machine PCs,
[3888.06 → 3889.94] which is probably not going to sell as many in my opinion.
[3890.22 → 3891.06] So these are...
[3891.06 → 3893.34] But, I mean, Valve has such brand equity...
[3893.34 → 3893.70] That too.
[3893.70 → 3895.06] ...that they could say,
[3895.06 → 3897.92] Well, look, no, if you want the ultimate Steam Box experience,
[3898.04 → 3899.02] you can get it this way.
[3899.02 → 3900.78] Or you can go work with a third party.
[3900.84 → 3901.64] Or you can build your own.
[3901.70 → 3902.06] Or whatever.
[3902.18 → 3902.74] But we're Valve.
[3902.84 → 3904.92] So if you want one built by us, boom.
[3905.04 → 3905.26] Boom.
[3905.38 → 3905.70] Exactly.
[3905.88 → 3908.26] And something that's been interesting is boutique system builders.
[3908.74 → 3910.10] We kind of rag on it every once in a while
[3910.10 → 3913.92] because it's so hard to effectively be a boutique system builder.
[3914.26 → 3916.26] This might be the only point in time where it makes sense.
[3916.26 → 3919.54] Because if you build Steam machines,
[3919.74 → 3923.06] you're getting into an audience where they don't want to build their own computer,
[3923.22 → 3923.62] potentially.
[3923.88 → 3924.04] Yep.
[3924.18 → 3927.72] And they want something that's not an HP.
[3928.50 → 3928.84] Yeah.
[3929.16 → 3931.00] And they want something that's built for that application.
[3931.10 → 3931.94] So it might make more sense.
[3931.94 → 3933.62] The rest of the specs look great as well.
[3933.70 → 3936.20] Intel 4770s or 4570s.
[3936.26 → 3937.72] There's going to be some i's.
[3937.94 → 3942.08] Storage is going to be a 1TB slash 8GB hybrid SSHD.
[3942.22 → 3944.94] It sounds like Seagate's drive in all likelihood.
[3945.42 → 3947.56] Power supply will be an internal 450W
[3947.56 → 3951.30] because Valve actually understands that you don't need a 1200W power supply
[3951.30 → 3952.74] even to power something like a Titan.
[3952.86 → 3953.32] Gold rated.
[3953.32 → 3957.58] Although 450W is probably borderline for a 4770 in a Titan.
[3958.40 → 3960.74] And then finally 16GB of RAM.
[3960.88 → 3964.62] So they are really going balls to the walls on the hardware here,
[3964.74 → 3966.24] which leads us into,
[3966.34 → 3968.50] unless you had something else to say about Valve's prototype.
[3968.62 → 3971.64] Just the Titan thing is that they're not going to be,
[3972.52 → 3973.66] I don't think any of these,
[3973.88 → 3977.56] I think what they're expecting is that if you're getting a prototype,
[3978.32 → 3978.96] that if you,
[3979.14 → 3980.56] they're saying fully customizable, right?
[3980.72 → 3980.86] Yeah.
[3980.92 → 3982.36] So if you wanted to overclock like crazy
[3982.36 → 3984.66] and do heavier things on it
[3984.66 → 3987.38] that you could put in a bigger power supply, probably.
[3987.68 → 3987.92] Okay.
[3987.98 → 3988.60] Because it's fully customizable.
[3988.96 → 3989.70] Because I think what they're expecting is...
[3989.70 → 3991.54] But the prototype has to work out of the box.
[3991.72 → 3991.86] I mean...
[3991.86 → 3992.72] I think it'll work.
[3992.80 → 3993.04] Okay.
[3993.22 → 3993.76] That'll work.
[3994.52 → 3994.96] All right.
[3995.08 → 3999.80] So XI3 to unveil the piston.
[4000.18 → 4004.52] So this is apparently going to be shipping as soon as,
[4004.58 → 4004.96] what was it?
[4005.08 → 4006.12] Mid-November?
[4006.26 → 4006.58] November, yeah.
[4006.82 → 4009.98] Mid-November for folks who pre-ordered them a while ago.
[4009.98 → 4012.64] And late November, like the end of November,
[4012.74 → 4013.90] I think the 29th,
[4014.16 → 4016.30] for folks who want to order one now.
[4016.48 → 4017.74] So they are saying,
[4017.98 → 4019.66] okay, it's a powerful gaming system.
[4019.74 → 4021.82] However, powerful is very relative.
[4022.36 → 4022.48] Yeah.
[4022.48 → 4024.24] It is not that powerful
[4024.24 → 4027.22] compared to what Valve will be shipping as prototypes.
[4027.22 → 4030.84] Because this is going to be what I'd consider to be more like...
[4030.84 → 4034.58] More like a next-gen console in terms of CPU power.
[4034.68 → 4036.86] But the GPU power will actually be less.
[4036.96 → 4038.96] This is an APU-based machine.
[4039.12 → 4039.24] Yeah.
[4039.50 → 4041.10] So here you can see what it looks like.
[4041.48 → 4042.56] APU-based machine.
[4042.66 → 4044.28] It'll be powerful for its size.
[4045.08 → 4045.24] Yeah.
[4045.30 → 4046.06] It's tiny.
[4046.06 → 4049.44] So it's four inches by four inches by four inches.
[4050.00 → 4053.08] Their website has a bunch of different pictures on it,
[4053.12 → 4055.98] including a dude wearing it as like a backpack.
[4056.50 → 4058.06] So you can see that right here.
[4058.36 → 4060.78] And wearing what looks like a VR device and a...
[4060.78 → 4063.82] Interesting because of certain things that don't make sense,
[4063.94 → 4066.44] but kind of epic if you can make it work.
[4066.62 → 4067.46] It'd be awesome.
[4067.66 → 4068.44] There's no battery.
[4069.18 → 4069.88] Or they haven't...
[4069.88 → 4071.90] I looked like crazy.
[4072.06 → 4073.34] I spent a really long time on this topic
[4073.34 → 4075.26] because I was digging through everything
[4075.26 → 4076.32] trying to find if there's a battery.
[4076.44 → 4076.66] Because I'm like,
[4076.70 → 4078.14] how is this guy wearing it in the back?
[4078.20 → 4078.42] Okay.
[4078.60 → 4080.40] Here's my suggestion.
[4080.68 → 4083.62] I would suggest that it uses DC in
[4083.62 → 4085.60] because it's going to be relatively low power.
[4086.00 → 4087.36] And if that were the case,
[4087.40 → 4090.64] you saw that huge external battery that Easel bought, right?
[4091.02 → 4093.24] A 25,000 William hour battery.
[4093.44 → 4095.56] You could buy a half a dozen of them,
[4095.64 → 4096.22] daisy chain them,
[4096.22 → 4097.28] and you could...
[4097.28 → 4098.72] If you look in my notes,
[4098.72 → 4100.36] I was saying something I would love to do
[4100.36 → 4101.30] is thrown this in a backpack
[4101.30 → 4102.74] with a huge pile of batteries.
[4102.98 → 4103.08] Yes.
[4103.08 → 4104.34] And then go into...
[4104.34 → 4105.12] And something I thought of,
[4105.18 → 4105.70] this is...
[4105.70 → 4107.58] We always have our crazy off-the-wall theories,
[4107.68 → 4108.52] so this is one of mine,
[4108.88 → 4110.96] is you could go into a paintball arena
[4110.96 → 4113.46] or a laser tag arena
[4113.46 → 4116.00] and have that space mapped out
[4116.00 → 4118.24] into the thing.
[4118.40 → 4118.90] That'd be so cool.
[4118.90 → 4119.98] And then go around with a gun
[4119.98 → 4120.94] wearing an Oculus Rift
[4120.94 → 4122.60] and have fake enemies all over the place.
[4122.68 → 4123.86] That would be so cool.
[4123.88 → 4124.26] Like, how epic.
[4124.40 → 4126.12] Or even better yet, real enemies?
[4126.92 → 4128.00] Real enemies, but then you'd have to have...
[4128.00 → 4128.80] Real enemies and bots?
[4128.80 → 4131.00] You would just have to have some sort of
[4131.00 → 4134.16] positional tracking on the backpacks
[4134.16 → 4135.52] so they could say where they were.
[4135.60 → 4137.00] Oculus in its current form
[4137.00 → 4138.60] where you connect it to a desktop PC
[4138.60 → 4139.48] is fascinating,
[4140.08 → 4140.36] but this...
[4140.36 → 4141.48] It's everything else
[4141.48 → 4142.40] that's going to be super cool.
[4142.40 → 4145.56] This is going to be just freaking insane.
[4145.98 → 4146.58] So, okay,
[4146.72 → 4148.42] so the piston can power up to three displays.
[4148.96 → 4149.64] Who cares?
[4149.72 → 4151.98] Because the GPU is just plain not that powerful.
[4152.06 → 4152.84] It's going to have, I think,
[4152.84 → 4153.60] eight gigs of RAM
[4153.60 → 4154.76] in its stock configuration.
[4155.66 → 4156.86] It's an APU.
[4157.14 → 4157.40] Blah, blah, blah.
[4157.40 → 4159.50] It'll start with a 128 gigabyte SSD,
[4159.64 → 4161.32] but you can upgrade to two 512s.
[4161.32 → 4161.46] Yep.
[4161.50 → 4163.44] So those are just standard M-SATA drives.
[4163.86 → 4164.52] Tiny.
[4164.66 → 4165.56] Tons of I.O.
[4165.56 → 4167.86] So 12 USB 2 ports.
[4168.00 → 4168.68] Display port.
[4168.80 → 4169.82] Mini display port.
[4170.10 → 4171.00] All kinds of great stuff
[4171.00 → 4172.42] so you can see what they've got planned there.
[4172.60 → 4174.90] Sorry, four of them were USB 3.0 ports.
[4175.54 → 4178.38] And so this is, I think,
[4178.68 → 4180.70] I think this ties in really well
[4180.70 → 4183.48] to a topic that I was talking to Chris Peril lo about
[4183.48 → 4185.30] at the airport when we were in Hawaii.
[4185.64 → 4188.00] And I got a lot of flack
[4188.00 → 4189.60] in the comments under his video,
[4189.82 → 4191.36] which I basically said,
[4191.44 → 4194.30] PS4, Xbox One is the last generation
[4194.30 → 4196.02] of dedicated gaming consoles.
[4196.04 → 4198.80] There's people in dedicated gaming media
[4198.80 → 4199.82] that have said that.
[4199.94 → 4200.80] I don't know if you've heard this.
[4200.80 → 4201.50] So hold on.
[4202.28 → 4204.20] The people that were arguing with me
[4204.20 → 4206.40] seem to have largely not watched the video
[4206.40 → 4208.98] because what they're saying is,
[4208.98 → 4211.06] mobile will never replace
[4211.06 → 4213.48] the big screen experience with a controller.
[4213.64 → 4214.66] Didn't say that.
[4215.16 → 4216.14] I didn't say that.
[4216.20 → 4217.28] He's a dedicated console.
[4217.32 → 4217.98] At all.
[4218.36 → 4219.92] I said a dedicated box for...
[4219.92 → 4220.86] I had one guy say,
[4221.12 → 4222.14] well, this guy's an idiot
[4222.14 → 4223.70] because it might be something
[4223.70 → 4225.02] integrated into your TV.
[4225.38 → 4227.36] Yeah, I said that in the video.
[4228.36 → 4231.08] Cons that the couch gaming experience
[4231.08 → 4232.34] isn't going away.
[4232.60 → 4232.82] No.
[4232.94 → 4234.70] That would be a stupid thing to say.
[4234.76 → 4235.24] That would be ridiculous.
[4235.24 → 4237.06] What I said is that
[4237.06 → 4239.26] if this generation of consoles
[4239.26 → 4240.50] has a life cycle
[4240.50 → 4241.96] that's as long as the last one
[4241.96 → 4243.30] of about eight years,
[4243.46 → 4244.92] we will have outgrown it
[4244.92 → 4246.10] by eight years from now.
[4246.14 → 4247.68] There's people speculating 10 years
[4247.68 → 4248.62] and in 10 years,
[4248.78 → 4250.58] if your phone can't plug in
[4250.58 → 4251.74] to your TV
[4251.74 → 4253.32] and power the whole thing,
[4253.70 → 4255.30] what were we doing for 10 years?
[4255.60 → 4256.06] Yes.
[4256.18 → 4257.38] You look at how quickly
[4257.38 → 4258.60] it's moving right now
[4258.60 → 4261.60] compared to the speed
[4261.60 → 4263.98] at which larger devices are moving,
[4263.98 → 4266.92] we're moving towards smaller cores
[4266.92 → 4268.00] that are very powerful
[4268.00 → 4269.22] but also very power efficient
[4269.22 → 4269.70] and that's where
[4269.70 → 4270.96] all the development's going.
[4271.34 → 4272.88] Nobody gives any cares
[4272.88 → 4274.84] about building a new cell processor.
[4275.06 → 4275.28] Yeah.
[4275.78 → 4276.10] Okay?
[4276.66 → 4277.92] So, no.
[4278.08 → 4278.98] I'm not saying
[4278.98 → 4280.16] you're not going to sit on your couch
[4280.16 → 4280.78] with a controller
[4280.78 → 4281.56] and play games.
[4281.76 → 4282.90] People will still do that.
[4282.94 → 4283.94] That will pretty much
[4283.94 → 4284.58] always be a thing.
[4284.90 → 4286.52] But to imagine
[4286.52 → 4288.56] that you need a dedicated device
[4288.56 → 4290.38] that exists just for playing games
[4290.38 → 4290.98] on your TV
[4290.98 → 4291.88] in eight years
[4291.88 → 4292.64] is ridiculous.
[4292.64 → 4294.44] So, I really think
[4294.44 → 4295.20] that platforms,
[4295.62 → 4296.98] like I suggested in the video
[4296.98 → 4298.38] that Android or iOS
[4298.38 → 4300.28] could potentially take a chunk of this
[4300.28 → 4301.04] and people are like,
[4301.24 → 4302.48] oh, the game devs
[4302.48 → 4303.50] will continue to develop
[4303.50 → 4303.86] for Vita.
[4304.48 → 4305.28] Come on!
[4305.82 → 4305.96] What?
[4307.24 → 4308.56] Nintendo is still going to exist
[4308.56 → 4309.76] as a hardware manufacturer
[4309.76 → 4310.30] in eight years?
[4310.34 → 4310.96] Are you kidding me?
[4311.52 → 4312.30] Good luck.
[4312.60 → 4313.64] I challenge you, Nintendo
[4313.64 → 4315.66] because platforms like,
[4315.74 → 4317.08] open platforms like Android
[4317.08 → 4318.64] will attract game developers.
[4318.78 → 4319.70] We have seen.
[4320.10 → 4320.84] Who was it?
[4321.16 → 4321.78] Someone's charging.
[4321.78 → 4322.64] I could see devices
[4322.64 → 4324.12] from Nintendo running Android.
[4324.42 → 4324.62] Sure.
[4325.32 → 4326.04] That's actually,
[4326.12 → 4327.04] I had a talk with a friend
[4327.04 → 4327.82] about this not long ago.
[4327.82 → 4328.38] That would be like,
[4328.50 → 4329.96] that would be a rebranding exercise
[4329.96 → 4330.98] more than anything else.
[4331.08 → 4332.10] Okay, fine, fine,
[4332.14 → 4332.94] okay, fine, fine, fine.
[4333.18 → 4334.48] But to suggest
[4334.48 → 4336.02] that closed platforms
[4336.02 → 4337.68] will continue to be a thing
[4337.68 → 4338.66] I think is ridiculous.
[4339.10 → 4340.50] We've seen already,
[4340.62 → 4341.62] I think it was $15
[4341.62 → 4343.44] was the most expensive game
[4343.44 → 4344.46] on the App Store.
[4344.46 → 4346.38] and it's selling.
[4347.14 → 4348.22] So, no,
[4348.62 → 4350.38] you don't have to develop for,
[4350.56 → 4351.66] and we can prove
[4351.66 → 4352.66] that you don't have to develop
[4352.66 → 4353.72] for a closed platform
[4353.72 → 4354.78] and all of a sudden
[4354.78 → 4356.04] anyone on their phone
[4356.04 → 4356.68] or TV
[4356.68 → 4357.48] or Shield
[4357.48 → 4358.26] or whatever else
[4358.26 → 4359.32] can consume your game,
[4359.52 → 4360.28] you're going to be hitting
[4360.28 → 4361.68] so much larger of an audience.
[4361.76 → 4362.98] What do game devs look for?
[4363.18 → 4363.66] They look for
[4363.66 → 4364.44] where are people willing
[4364.44 → 4365.06] to spend money?
[4365.16 → 4366.36] People love buying apps.
[4366.56 → 4367.24] And they look for
[4367.24 → 4369.28] where is a large installation base?
[4369.28 → 4370.58] Why do you develop
[4370.58 → 4371.82] for Xbox 360?
[4372.16 → 4373.64] Because there are millions
[4373.64 → 4374.46] of them out there.
[4374.98 → 4375.64] Why do you develop
[4375.64 → 4376.64] for Android
[4376.64 → 4378.46] versus Windows Phone?
[4378.68 → 4380.18] Because there are millions
[4380.18 → 4380.96] of them out there.
[4381.22 → 4382.12] The installation base
[4382.12 → 4383.00] for Android
[4383.00 → 4385.06] will completely eclipse
[4385.06 → 4386.62] anything that PS4
[4386.62 → 4388.26] or Xbox One combined
[4388.26 → 4389.74] could hope to accomplish
[4389.74 → 4390.80] eight years from now.
[4390.88 → 4391.70] In fact, probably already.
[4391.92 → 4392.60] And we're going to look
[4392.60 → 4393.26] at cell phones
[4393.26 → 4394.44] that you will own
[4394.44 → 4396.14] in not that long
[4396.14 → 4397.30] that will be more powerful
[4397.30 → 4398.20] than that console
[4398.20 → 4398.90] that you own.
[4398.90 → 4399.48] Yes.
[4399.64 → 4400.72] That is going to happen.
[4400.84 → 4401.64] So when I brought up
[4401.64 → 4402.86] plugging your phone
[4402.86 → 4403.52] into the TV,
[4403.84 → 4404.50] that's because your phone
[4404.50 → 4405.10] will be better
[4405.10 → 4406.30] than the console
[4406.30 → 4407.18] that you also have
[4407.18 → 4407.88] plugged into the TV.
[4408.06 → 4409.20] So there you go, guys.
[4409.38 → 4410.56] Yes, it'll hold on
[4410.56 → 4411.72] and yes, this generation
[4411.72 → 4412.30] of consoles
[4412.30 → 4413.60] will continue to exist.
[4414.18 → 4414.70] But...
[4414.70 → 4415.74] And you know what?
[4415.82 → 4416.84] Okay, maybe we'll see
[4416.84 → 4417.28] one more,
[4417.58 → 4418.60] but I don't think
[4418.60 → 4419.44] it'll be that successful.
[4419.80 → 4420.48] I don't think it'll be
[4420.48 → 4421.26] that big of a deal.
[4421.40 → 4422.18] That's another thing.
[4422.26 → 4422.74] Like, Nintendo
[4422.74 → 4424.26] not making their own device.
[4424.34 → 4424.98] Like, they might still
[4424.98 → 4425.80] be making their own device.
[4426.16 → 4427.84] It might be side by side.
[4428.08 → 4428.50] Like, there might be
[4428.50 → 4429.18] a dedicated Nintendo
[4429.18 → 4430.18] one and an Android one
[4430.18 → 4430.92] or they might just
[4430.92 → 4431.68] be struggling along.
[4431.76 → 4432.28] It just won't be
[4432.28 → 4432.76] on the scale
[4432.76 → 4433.24] it currently is.
[4433.24 → 4434.24] Or we might see
[4434.24 → 4435.86] some kind of evolution
[4435.86 → 4438.04] where games could be
[4438.04 → 4439.06] platform specific.
[4439.44 → 4439.84] Like, Nintendo
[4439.84 → 4440.58] could lock down
[4440.58 → 4441.28] Nintendo games
[4441.28 → 4441.72] to only run
[4441.72 → 4442.38] on their Android thing.
[4442.60 → 4443.34] I don't see
[4443.34 → 4444.56] that happening, though.
[4444.74 → 4446.08] I could see it happening.
[4446.16 → 4446.58] I don't know
[4446.58 → 4447.12] why they would.
[4447.18 → 4447.84] It'll all come down
[4447.84 → 4448.72] to game devs, though.
[4448.84 → 4449.40] And I mean,
[4449.46 → 4450.42] people making the argument
[4450.42 → 4451.58] in the comments as well
[4451.58 → 4452.88] that, oh, yeah,
[4453.14 → 4454.40] I'm going to replace
[4454.40 → 4456.22] my GTA 5 gaming experience
[4456.22 → 4457.02] with Angry Birds.
[4457.44 → 4458.86] Angry Birds isn't the only game
[4458.86 → 4459.88] that runs on Android.
[4460.32 → 4461.44] Like, let's get over that.
[4461.52 → 4462.46] Let's just move past that.
[4462.56 → 4463.74] We don't have GTA 5
[4463.74 → 4464.30] running on Android,
[4464.40 → 4465.34] but at some point
[4465.34 → 4466.26] it will be able to.
[4466.26 → 4467.50] be capable of doing it.
[4467.54 → 4467.74] Yeah.
[4467.86 → 4468.78] And if there's money
[4468.78 → 4469.40] to be made
[4469.40 → 4470.30] by doing that,
[4470.74 → 4471.08] pfft.
[4471.68 → 4472.02] I mean,
[4472.12 → 4472.78] you'd be crazy
[4472.78 → 4473.52] as a game dev
[4473.52 → 4474.38] to not develop
[4474.38 → 4475.06] for a platform
[4475.06 → 4475.98] where people will
[4475.98 → 4476.70] throw buckets of money
[4476.70 → 4477.02] at you.
[4477.14 → 4477.92] One of the main reasons
[4477.92 → 4478.52] why I was interested
[4478.52 → 4479.46] in Ubuntu Edge
[4479.46 → 4480.64] back to throwing
[4480.64 → 4481.44] way back to this
[4481.44 → 4482.14] was because once
[4482.14 → 4482.64] you plugged it
[4482.64 → 4483.54] into a computer
[4483.54 → 4484.92] or a monitor
[4484.92 → 4485.56] and it detected
[4485.56 → 4486.80] that setup was going on,
[4487.26 → 4488.58] it would completely change.
[4488.64 → 4489.04] It would boot
[4489.04 → 4490.90] into Ubuntu Desktop OS
[4490.90 → 4492.26] instead of Ubuntu Mobile OS.
[4492.58 → 4493.22] And I found that
[4493.22 → 4494.04] fascinating
[4494.04 → 4494.84] because you can plug
[4494.84 → 4495.86] your phone into a screen
[4495.86 → 4496.90] that's bigger than it
[4496.90 → 4498.00] and it still sucks
[4498.00 → 4499.52] because it's a mobile OS
[4499.52 → 4500.32] and it's all weird
[4500.32 → 4500.72] and whatever.
[4501.34 → 4502.32] But if it boots
[4502.32 → 4503.46] into a desktop OS,
[4503.82 → 4504.36] how about you
[4504.36 → 4504.76] plug your phone
[4504.76 → 4505.44] into your TV,
[4505.62 → 4507.72] it boots into a console OS.
[4507.84 → 4508.04] Sure.
[4508.30 → 4509.26] And we've seen glimmers
[4509.26 → 4510.68] of that with Android already
[4510.68 → 4511.48] and things like
[4511.48 → 4512.76] the Asus Transformer.
[4512.86 → 4513.04] Yeah.
[4513.36 → 4513.92] Where, okay,
[4514.02 → 4514.38] yeah, yeah,
[4514.42 → 4515.44] mouse keyboard support,
[4515.58 → 4516.02] sure, yeah,
[4516.10 → 4517.04] have a more desktop-like
[4517.04 → 4517.48] experience.
[4517.68 → 4518.42] There's no reason,
[4518.48 → 4518.66] I mean,
[4518.78 → 4520.00] eight years.
[4520.70 → 4521.70] It's a really long time.
[4521.70 → 4523.02] It's a really long time.
[4523.02 → 4523.96] In eight years,
[4524.12 → 4524.94] we've seen
[4524.94 → 4526.98] smartphones come into existence
[4526.98 → 4528.84] to where we are today.
[4528.98 → 4529.14] Like,
[4529.18 → 4530.08] when you just think
[4530.08 → 4530.50] eight years,
[4530.56 → 4531.38] it doesn't seem like that long,
[4531.44 → 4532.46] but actually go back
[4532.46 → 4533.04] and look,
[4533.24 → 4533.86] try and figure out
[4533.86 → 4534.98] what tech you owned
[4534.98 → 4535.66] eight years ago.
[4535.98 → 4536.62] And then just be like,
[4536.66 → 4537.46] it's laughable.
[4538.04 → 4538.56] So, okay,
[4538.72 → 4540.04] let's move into our next topic
[4540.04 → 4540.92] because I think I've ranted
[4540.92 → 4541.68] about that enough.
[4542.02 → 4543.56] The Silk Road
[4543.56 → 4546.52] has been busted open.
[4547.20 → 4547.60] So,
[4547.88 → 4548.48] you know what,
[4548.54 → 4549.40] you're more into
[4549.40 → 4550.90] this whole stuff than me,
[4550.90 → 4551.78] so go ahead.
[4552.14 → 4553.36] To first explain
[4553.36 → 4554.20] what it is,
[4554.28 → 4555.54] it's a website
[4555.54 → 4556.82] on the quote-unquote,
[4557.02 → 4557.56] people hate it
[4557.56 → 4558.18] when I say quote-unquote,
[4558.46 → 4558.80] quote,
[4559.18 → 4559.70] dark net,
[4559.86 → 4560.24] unquote,
[4560.42 → 4560.88] there we go.
[4562.86 → 4564.08] I called it for that
[4564.08 → 4565.26] a ton one live stream.
[4566.04 → 4567.88] That uses bitcoins
[4567.88 → 4569.22] and a weird way
[4569.22 → 4570.42] of transferring bitcoins
[4570.42 → 4571.34] to sell drugs
[4571.34 → 4572.10] or narcotics.
[4572.36 → 4573.32] Or fake IDs.
[4573.44 → 4574.02] Or fake IDs.
[4574.02 → 4575.58] Anything that you would sell
[4575.58 → 4576.54] on the black market,
[4577.48 → 4577.98] quote-unquote,
[4578.44 → 4580.96] would go on this website.
[4581.14 → 4582.12] So the idea of it
[4582.12 → 4583.14] was that you could only
[4583.14 → 4583.90] access it
[4583.90 → 4585.28] through a Tor network.
[4585.56 → 4587.12] It was a.onion website,
[4587.48 → 4588.58] so it wasn't .com.
[4588.76 → 4589.72] They have a weird,
[4589.86 → 4590.68] crazy URL,
[4591.16 → 4593.04] which is in the doc
[4593.04 → 4593.94] for people that are interested,
[4594.22 → 4595.44] but wouldn't exactly
[4595.44 → 4597.00] suggest going right now.
[4598.14 → 4598.60] And, like,
[4598.82 → 4600.64] users would connect to it
[4600.64 → 4601.66] by going behind a proxy,
[4601.84 → 4603.18] so like Hotspot Shield
[4603.18 → 4604.14] or something,
[4604.70 → 4606.06] and then tore up
[4606.06 → 4606.90] behind that,
[4607.12 → 4607.98] and then they'd be able
[4607.98 → 4608.68] to access the website.
[4608.80 → 4610.10] So it was below
[4610.10 → 4611.30] layers of security.
[4612.00 → 4613.44] And the idea was that
[4613.44 → 4614.28] everyone,
[4614.74 → 4615.12] sellers,
[4615.36 → 4615.74] buyers,
[4616.00 → 4616.34] owners,
[4616.60 → 4617.68] was completely anonymous.
[4618.00 → 4618.18] Yeah.
[4618.50 → 4619.56] And that helps,
[4619.64 → 4621.08] and these.onion websites,
[4621.22 → 4621.94] how all they work
[4621.94 → 4622.50] and all that kind of stuff,
[4622.60 → 4623.62] tons of anonymity.
[4623.96 → 4624.94] And then even the way
[4624.94 → 4625.62] that the bitcoins
[4625.62 → 4626.12] are transferred
[4626.12 → 4626.98] in between people
[4626.98 → 4628.08] helped because,
[4628.18 → 4628.34] you know,
[4628.40 → 4629.12] bitcoin transactions
[4629.12 → 4629.90] are traceable.
[4629.92 → 4630.40] They're traceable.
[4630.40 → 4631.22] So the way
[4631.22 → 4632.16] that they went around
[4632.16 → 4633.18] was in this weird,
[4633.28 → 4633.44] loopy way.
[4633.44 → 4634.08] It was like scrambled
[4634.08 → 4634.68] or something.
[4635.08 → 4635.14] Yeah.
[4635.34 → 4637.08] So you could follow it,
[4637.14 → 4638.08] but it was really confusing
[4638.08 → 4638.86] and it was pretty much
[4638.86 → 4639.60] impossible to find
[4639.60 → 4640.70] who it actually ended up with.
[4641.14 → 4641.84] Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[4641.94 → 4643.00] All that kind of stuff.
[4643.10 → 4644.28] So what happened was
[4644.28 → 4645.00] the
[4645.22 → 4646.50] not the original creator,
[4646.78 → 4647.24] but the guy
[4647.24 → 4648.20] that took it over.
[4648.20 → 4651.38] So that's Ross Ulbricht.
[4651.82 → 4652.18] Or,
[4652.30 → 4653.24] or what was his,
[4653.32 → 4654.18] what was his tag?
[4654.20 → 4655.44] Dread Pirate Roberts.
[4655.64 → 4656.04] There we go,
[4656.12 → 4656.28] yeah,
[4656.38 → 4657.36] as a throwback
[4657.36 → 4659.00] to an old movie.
[4659.56 → 4660.36] I love that movie.
[4660.42 → 4660.86] It's awesome.
[4661.06 → 4661.30] Yeah,
[4661.46 → 4662.22] it's one of your favourites.
[4662.34 → 4662.56] Yes.
[4662.66 → 4663.00] I think.
[4663.30 → 4664.20] Some people will know
[4664.20 → 4664.86] what we're talking about.
[4664.88 → 4665.40] Princess Bride.
[4665.54 → 4665.70] Yeah.
[4665.80 → 4665.94] There.
[4667.06 → 4667.44] Sorry,
[4667.52 → 4667.88] what was I going to say?
[4667.92 → 4668.06] Yeah,
[4668.16 → 4669.32] so he has posts
[4669.32 → 4670.50] on like Stack Overflow,
[4670.74 → 4671.40] which I linked
[4671.40 → 4672.96] in the document,
[4673.08 → 4673.42] which you guys
[4673.42 → 4674.04] can check out,
[4674.28 → 4675.22] which is just like,
[4675.70 → 4675.84] K,
[4675.84 → 4676.72] and like people
[4676.72 → 4677.46] knew it was him
[4677.46 → 4678.48] and he's talking about
[4678.48 → 4679.98] like securing Onion websites
[4679.98 → 4680.98] and it's just like,
[4681.88 → 4682.04] K.
[4682.42 → 4683.76] And then in PMs
[4683.76 → 4684.50] to a few users,
[4684.64 → 4685.30] he put his,
[4685.36 → 4686.58] his personal email address,
[4686.66 → 4687.64] which had his name on it.
[4688.32 → 4688.76] So it's like,
[4689.04 → 4689.24] K.
[4689.56 → 4690.14] And then the FBI
[4690.14 → 4691.40] has been on him forever.
[4691.94 → 4692.18] He,
[4692.18 → 4693.06] he tried to place
[4693.06 → 4694.26] two hitman contracts
[4694.26 → 4695.54] through FBI agents,
[4695.64 → 4696.26] not knowing that
[4696.26 → 4697.04] they're FBI agents.
[4697.22 → 4697.90] He tried to buy
[4697.90 → 4699.00] a kilogram of coke
[4699.00 → 4700.60] through FBI agents.
[4700.92 → 4701.18] Like,
[4701.36 → 4701.50] he,
[4701.72 → 4702.22] for,
[4702.28 → 4702.50] for,
[4702.50 → 4703.38] for running
[4703.38 → 4704.84] this like super secret
[4704.84 → 4705.72] crazy thing
[4705.72 → 4706.54] that tons of people
[4706.54 → 4706.98] were on,
[4707.08 → 4708.46] where's my metrics?
[4708.56 → 4710.30] There's 146,000
[4710.30 → 4711.76] unique buyer accounts.
[4712.08 → 4712.80] Now in saying that,
[4712.84 → 4713.30] there was almost
[4713.30 → 4714.38] a million accounts.
[4714.84 → 4716.04] It's just 146,000
[4716.04 → 4717.44] unique buyer accounts.
[4717.68 → 4718.26] These people that
[4718.26 → 4719.04] actually put through
[4719.04 → 4719.62] transactions
[4719.62 → 4720.76] and there was
[4720.76 → 4722.44] 9 million Bitcoins
[4722.44 → 4723.18] transferred through
[4723.18 → 4723.58] this thing.
[4723.84 → 4724.80] If you break that down,
[4724.88 → 4725.12] that's,
[4725.32 → 4725.84] as far as I know,
[4725.88 → 4726.76] like billions of dollars.
[4727.00 → 4728.74] A 1.2 billion today
[4728.74 → 4729.96] would be the
[4729.96 → 4730.36] yeah,
[4730.44 → 4731.30] so the sales revenue
[4731.30 → 4731.66] of more than
[4731.66 → 4733.26] 9.5 million Bitcoins
[4733.26 → 4734.48] valued at 1.2 billion.
[4734.48 → 4734.92] And,
[4734.92 → 4735.70] and people figured out
[4735.70 → 4736.30] that was like
[4736.30 → 4738.22] a huge percentage
[4738.22 → 4739.34] of all Bitcoin
[4739.34 → 4740.54] transactions going on
[4740.54 → 4740.56] at all.
[4740.56 → 4740.58] Yeah,
[4740.58 → 4740.74] I think it was something
[4740.74 → 4741.36] like half.
[4741.54 → 4741.82] Yeah.
[4742.20 → 4742.40] So,
[4742.40 → 4743.08] we're,
[4743.20 → 4744.18] we're through this website.
[4744.18 → 4744.22] So,
[4744.22 → 4744.80] when this got,
[4744.88 → 4745.46] when this got,
[4745.60 → 4746.84] when he got busted,
[4747.14 → 4749.68] Bitcoin fell by 29%
[4749.68 → 4751.58] immediately.
[4752.52 → 4753.08] Which is like,
[4753.44 → 4754.12] wow.
[4754.60 → 4755.42] For people that were
[4755.42 → 4756.40] trying to keep Bitcoin
[4756.40 → 4757.06] up on the
[4757.26 → 4757.78] up and up
[4757.78 → 4758.70] and like the good
[4758.70 → 4759.50] kind of situation,
[4759.70 → 4760.62] you just lost a lot of money.
[4760.62 → 4761.42] And it's one of those things
[4761.42 → 4761.78] where we,
[4761.92 → 4762.14] you know,
[4762.20 → 4762.92] we look at Bitcoin
[4762.92 → 4763.60] and we kind of go,
[4763.68 → 4763.84] yeah,
[4763.96 → 4764.70] great idea.
[4764.78 → 4765.00] But,
[4765.24 → 4766.00] if you're ever
[4766.00 → 4767.04] going to be legit,
[4767.58 → 4768.90] this kind of crap
[4768.90 → 4770.10] isn't going to help.
[4770.54 → 4770.82] Because,
[4770.96 → 4772.00] because all people
[4772.00 → 4772.50] are going to see it for,
[4772.56 → 4773.62] because they had this whole,
[4773.94 → 4775.34] the mentality behind the site
[4775.34 → 4776.32] was that
[4776.32 → 4777.28] they thought that
[4777.28 → 4778.34] all of this should be okay
[4778.34 → 4779.18] and should be legal
[4779.18 → 4779.88] and they were trying
[4779.88 → 4780.68] to make their own way
[4780.68 → 4781.08] of doing it.
[4781.14 → 4781.28] Like,
[4781.34 → 4782.32] it had a
[4782.32 → 4784.10] underlying philosophy.
[4784.34 → 4784.50] Yeah.
[4784.50 → 4785.52] And that's going to be
[4785.52 → 4786.60] completely ignored now
[4786.60 → 4787.72] that it's been busted open
[4787.72 → 4788.32] and the runner
[4788.32 → 4789.42] was trying to get people killed
[4789.42 → 4790.28] because that's what
[4790.28 → 4791.24] people are going to focus on.
[4791.40 → 4791.52] Yeah.
[4791.72 → 4792.16] So,
[4792.28 → 4793.32] your whole underlying philosophy
[4793.32 → 4795.02] just got blown the crap up
[4795.02 → 4796.18] and it's,
[4796.22 → 4796.46] it's,
[4796.52 → 4796.98] it's now,
[4797.14 → 4798.68] everyone is going to hear about this.
[4798.76 → 4800.04] It's huge on the news
[4800.04 → 4801.08] and all it says
[4801.08 → 4801.90] is Bitcoin is bad.
[4802.60 → 4802.84] So,
[4802.94 → 4804.14] that's a problem.
[4804.14 → 4804.70] A real shame.
[4804.88 → 4805.24] It is.
[4805.32 → 4805.82] It's actually,
[4806.00 → 4806.34] I mean,
[4806.34 → 4807.58] I think we should look at this
[4807.58 → 4809.48] as just from sort of
[4809.48 → 4810.46] a thousand-foot view.
[4810.60 → 4811.10] What a shame.
[4811.58 → 4812.80] What a shame for Bitcoin.
[4812.96 → 4814.48] What a shame for alternative currency.
[4814.50 → 4814.96] In general,
[4815.06 → 4815.40] because,
[4815.92 → 4816.34] you know,
[4816.44 → 4816.74] even,
[4816.88 → 4818.20] even other currencies
[4818.20 → 4819.12] like Litecoin
[4819.12 → 4820.32] are going to suffer
[4820.32 → 4821.38] as a result
[4821.38 → 4822.48] of the negative image
[4822.48 → 4823.04] of Bitcoin.
[4823.22 → 4823.50] And I mean,
[4823.52 → 4824.10] it's one of those things
[4824.10 → 4824.80] where we look at it
[4824.80 → 4825.02] and we go,
[4825.08 → 4825.22] well,
[4825.26 → 4825.90] the whole point is
[4825.90 → 4826.58] we want to get away
[4826.58 → 4828.32] from governments dictating
[4828.32 → 4829.56] what we can or cannot buy,
[4829.66 → 4830.38] where we can and cannot
[4830.38 → 4831.02] spend our money,
[4831.14 → 4831.40] et cetera,
[4831.48 → 4831.80] et cetera,
[4831.86 → 4832.30] et cetera.
[4832.50 → 4833.48] But the problem is
[4833.48 → 4834.58] that it seems,
[4834.78 → 4834.98] you know,
[4835.06 → 4836.24] like if I say this,
[4836.28 → 4837.38] I think it will be true.
[4837.80 → 4838.68] It seems like
[4838.68 → 4841.20] if people want to avoid
[4841.20 → 4842.02] having the government
[4842.02 → 4843.02] snooping in their affairs,
[4843.12 → 4843.20] well,
[4843.24 → 4844.30] this is what they're doing.
[4844.50 → 4844.82] Well,
[4844.94 → 4845.26] okay.
[4845.38 → 4846.18] And that for half
[4846.18 → 4846.74] of the people
[4846.74 → 4847.82] using Bitcoins,
[4848.00 → 4848.58] it was true,
[4848.64 → 4849.04] at least.
[4849.28 → 4851.04] The drug thing aside,
[4851.14 → 4852.24] because there are so many laws
[4852.24 → 4852.94] changing in that field
[4852.94 → 4853.30] right now.
[4853.54 → 4853.74] That's true.
[4853.96 → 4854.66] Whether you think
[4854.66 → 4855.52] it's bad or not,
[4855.60 → 4856.86] completely ignoring that,
[4857.12 → 4857.92] I think the part
[4857.92 → 4858.82] where it really stepped
[4858.82 → 4859.40] over the line
[4859.40 → 4860.26] was where he's trying
[4860.26 → 4860.90] to get people killed.
[4861.28 → 4861.40] Well,
[4861.44 → 4861.64] yeah,
[4861.72 → 4862.18] of course.
[4862.38 → 4862.50] Yeah.
[4862.50 → 4863.04] So it just,
[4863.32 → 4865.76] so that's the perception
[4865.76 → 4866.50] that will be,
[4866.64 → 4867.36] that will exist
[4867.36 → 4868.66] for half of all
[4868.66 → 4869.38] the transactions
[4869.38 → 4870.28] that were occurring
[4870.28 → 4871.22] using Bitcoin.
[4871.36 → 4871.50] Yeah.
[4871.96 → 4873.30] And that's all allegedly,
[4873.60 → 4874.36] we haven't confirmed
[4874.36 → 4874.94] that number
[4874.94 → 4876.12] through investigative journalism
[4876.12 → 4877.08] that half of the transactions
[4877.08 → 4877.26] were,
[4877.38 → 4877.50] but,
[4878.00 → 4878.26] but,
[4878.26 → 4879.76] I think part of that too
[4879.76 → 4881.14] is because of the
[4881.14 → 4882.94] kind of back loopy way
[4882.94 → 4883.90] that they're doing transactions,
[4884.04 → 4884.94] they bounced around a lot.
[4885.04 → 4885.26] Right.
[4885.38 → 4886.54] So that inflated the number
[4886.54 → 4887.02] like crazy,
[4887.12 → 4887.76] but still,
[4887.90 → 4889.28] nine million Bitcoins,
[4889.42 → 4890.52] it wasn't a small amount.
[4891.26 → 4891.40] Yeah.
[4891.40 → 4891.48] So,
[4891.58 → 4891.82] yeah.
[4892.04 → 4892.90] So one of the
[4892.90 → 4894.28] so he actually ended up
[4894.28 → 4894.82] getting busted
[4894.82 → 4896.58] due to a random,
[4896.98 → 4898.72] routine package inspection
[4898.72 → 4899.68] where he was having
[4899.68 → 4900.84] some fake documents
[4900.84 → 4901.66] shipped over the border.
[4902.58 → 4902.60] And,
[4902.64 → 4903.78] so there was,
[4903.84 → 4904.26] one of them was
[4904.26 → 4905.52] a California driver's license
[4905.52 → 4906.44] with his photograph
[4906.44 → 4907.66] and birthdate,
[4907.66 → 4908.78] but a different name.
[4909.10 → 4909.50] So,
[4909.92 → 4911.14] they ended up being able
[4911.14 → 4912.18] to put enough of it together
[4912.18 → 4912.98] that they were able
[4912.98 → 4913.24] to,
[4913.24 → 4913.88] to bust him.
[4914.22 → 4915.66] Canadians ended up catching him.
[4915.68 → 4917.10] And one thing that is kind of
[4917.10 → 4917.70] Go Canada!
[4918.18 → 4919.18] sucky in this is
[4919.18 → 4919.76] Go Canada!
[4919.94 → 4920.92] But a huge amount
[4920.92 → 4921.78] of the transactions
[4921.78 → 4922.90] and a huge amount of people
[4922.90 → 4923.28] on the website
[4923.28 → 4923.74] were Canadian.
[4924.30 → 4924.54] Yeah.
[4925.64 → 4926.08] Okay,
[4926.22 → 4927.30] so let's go Canada!
[4928.68 → 4929.36] Kind of.
[4930.74 → 4931.04] Uh,
[4931.04 → 4931.30] yeah.
[4931.54 → 4932.18] Alrighty then,
[4932.22 → 4933.88] we have a fantastic,
[4934.34 → 4934.72] uh,
[4934.82 → 4935.10] well,
[4935.20 → 4936.16] we have a fantastic
[4936.16 → 4937.30] sponsorship message
[4937.30 → 4937.72] for you
[4937.72 → 4938.86] before we start talking
[4938.86 → 4940.04] about cheating
[4940.04 → 4941.14] in Android benchmarks.
[4941.44 → 4942.40] And I almost feel
[4942.40 → 4943.04] a little bit
[4943.04 → 4943.58] sort of weird
[4943.58 → 4944.30] talking about this
[4944.30 → 4944.78] right now,
[4944.88 → 4945.10] but,
[4945.18 → 4945.52] um,
[4946.02 → 4947.60] whatever your reasons
[4947.60 → 4948.26] might be,
[4948.56 → 4949.12] and there are
[4949.12 → 4950.18] legitimate reasons
[4950.18 → 4951.36] to value your privacy
[4951.36 → 4952.02] on the internet.
[4952.70 → 4953.18] Seriously,
[4953.36 → 4954.10] with all the NSA
[4954.10 → 4955.18] crap going on
[4955.18 → 4955.62] right now,
[4955.90 → 4956.78] just because
[4956.78 → 4957.92] you're not buying
[4957.92 → 4958.88] drugs online
[4958.88 → 4959.84] doesn't mean
[4959.84 → 4960.50] that you shouldn't
[4960.50 → 4961.44] value your privacy.
[4962.04 → 4962.34] Um,
[4962.42 → 4964.32] VPNs are a great solution
[4964.32 → 4965.56] and Hotspot Shield
[4965.56 → 4966.70] is the proud sponsor
[4966.70 → 4967.38] of the WAN show
[4967.38 → 4968.08] for this week.
[4968.46 → 4968.90] So basically,
[4969.04 → 4969.26] guys,
[4969.36 → 4969.90] you can visit
[4969.90 → 4970.52] bit.ly
[4970.52 → 4971.62] slash HS share
[4971.62 → 4973.10] for 20% off
[4973.10 → 4973.64] your,
[4973.84 → 4974.90] any elite prices
[4974.90 → 4975.72] on new accounts.
[4975.84 → 4976.72] You can get a trial
[4976.72 → 4977.34] of the software,
[4977.52 → 4977.76] of course,
[4977.82 → 4978.36] and try it out
[4978.36 → 4979.10] before you buy.
[4979.66 → 4980.94] And what's the value
[4980.94 → 4981.54] of a VPN?
[4982.00 → 4982.14] You,
[4982.20 → 4982.98] you can do things
[4982.98 → 4984.10] like we just
[4984.10 → 4984.72] talked about
[4984.72 → 4985.46] where you can...
[4985.46 → 4985.60] No,
[4985.70 → 4986.58] not the buying drugs
[4986.58 → 4986.88] part.
[4986.94 → 4987.14] No,
[4987.24 → 4987.60] I didn't,
[4987.74 → 4987.88] I,
[4988.00 → 4989.78] I meant at the beginning
[4989.78 → 4990.62] where I was like
[4990.62 → 4991.58] to hide your footsteps
[4991.58 → 4992.24] and all that kind of stuff
[4992.24 → 4993.10] and maybe you're not
[4993.10 → 4993.82] buying drugs.
[4993.96 → 4994.54] Maybe you're trying
[4994.54 → 4995.44] to talk about something
[4995.44 → 4996.56] that you don't want
[4996.56 → 4997.70] other people to know about
[4997.70 → 4999.24] and that might not
[4999.24 → 5000.30] actually be an inherently
[5000.30 → 5000.90] bad thing.
[5000.98 → 5001.48] So you want to trace
[5001.48 → 5001.90] your steps.
[5002.48 → 5003.48] Not everything that's
[5003.48 → 5005.24] illegal is necessarily
[5005.24 → 5006.40] bad.
[5006.74 → 5006.92] I mean,
[5006.96 → 5007.68] we've seen this
[5007.68 → 5008.62] time and time again
[5008.62 → 5009.46] throughout history
[5009.46 → 5010.30] where not everything
[5010.30 → 5010.56] that,
[5010.90 → 5011.08] I mean,
[5011.12 → 5012.24] at times you couldn't
[5012.24 → 5013.18] talk about being a
[5013.18 → 5014.98] Christian for fear
[5014.98 → 5015.94] of execution.
[5016.38 → 5016.46] Yeah.
[5016.58 → 5016.60] Like,
[5016.60 → 5018.04] talking about things
[5018.04 → 5019.72] is not necessarily bad.
[5019.86 → 5021.28] So VPNs can help
[5021.28 → 5022.04] protect your privacy.
[5022.20 → 5023.14] Underground Railroad,
[5023.60 → 5023.96] it's all,
[5024.10 → 5024.28] like,
[5024.36 → 5025.50] there are tons of stuff
[5025.50 → 5025.66] that would have been...
[5025.66 → 5026.30] Being black
[5026.30 → 5027.60] is not inherently bad.
[5027.70 → 5027.88] No.
[5028.04 → 5028.84] I think we can all
[5028.84 → 5029.94] agree on this now
[5029.94 → 5030.86] but even,
[5030.98 → 5031.16] you know,
[5031.20 → 5032.18] a hundred years ago
[5032.18 → 5033.14] that wasn't a thing.
[5033.36 → 5033.64] So,
[5033.80 → 5034.10] anyway.
[5034.88 → 5035.02] So,
[5035.06 → 5036.00] so whatever your reasons be
[5036.00 → 5036.28] you can,
[5036.32 → 5037.24] you can hide your footsteps,
[5037.44 → 5037.66] you can,
[5037.92 → 5038.78] there are some things,
[5038.86 → 5039.96] I think it's just with iOS
[5039.96 → 5041.04] where it will actually
[5041.04 → 5042.22] kind of...
[5042.22 → 5042.88] Help save money
[5042.88 → 5043.70] on your data plan
[5043.70 → 5044.36] because it does
[5044.36 → 5045.38] compression on their side.
[5045.70 → 5046.30] So another thing
[5046.30 → 5046.92] you can do with it
[5046.92 → 5047.94] because all your traffic
[5047.94 → 5048.90] is being rerouted
[5048.90 → 5049.66] through their server
[5049.66 → 5050.66] is you can circumvent
[5050.66 → 5051.24] things like
[5051.28 → 5052.06] region restrictions
[5052.06 → 5053.32] for services like Netflix.
[5053.80 → 5054.44] It will slow down
[5054.44 → 5055.00] your connection
[5055.00 → 5056.14] but the only way
[5056.14 → 5056.76] to know for sure
[5056.76 → 5057.28] if you like it
[5057.28 → 5058.02] is gone try it.
[5058.06 → 5058.64] So check it out,
[5058.70 → 5059.56] bit.ly splash,
[5059.66 → 5060.40] HS share
[5060.40 → 5062.08] and if you do decide
[5062.08 → 5062.78] to buy anything,
[5062.90 → 5063.68] make sure that you
[5063.68 → 5065.02] use code Linus
[5065.02 → 5065.64] in order to get
[5065.64 → 5066.98] that 20% discount.
[5067.22 → 5068.04] So thanks again
[5068.04 → 5069.02] to Hotspot Shield
[5069.02 → 5069.66] for sponsoring
[5069.66 → 5070.28] The WAN Show
[5070.28 → 5071.74] and without further ado,
[5072.12 → 5072.78] boom!
[5073.20 → 5074.06] They are
[5074.06 → 5075.86] almost all dirty
[5075.86 → 5077.72] by Anand Lalshimpy
[5077.72 → 5079.20] and Brian Plug.
[5079.52 → 5080.10] So the state
[5080.10 → 5080.48] of cheating
[5080.48 → 5081.36] on Android benchmarks.
[5081.50 → 5082.24] So I want to preface
[5082.24 → 5082.96] this by saying
[5082.96 → 5084.00] cheating on benchmarks
[5084.00 → 5085.88] is not a new concept.
[5086.14 → 5086.22] No.
[5086.48 → 5087.54] Especially on the
[5087.54 → 5088.80] PC side,
[5088.90 → 5090.36] we have seen this
[5090.36 → 5092.32] over and over
[5092.32 → 5093.34] and over again
[5093.34 → 5093.92] whether it was
[5093.92 → 5095.50] 3DMark 2001,
[5095.82 → 5096.86] 3DMark 2003,
[5097.32 → 5099.96] every graphics company
[5099.96 → 5101.44] was doing everything
[5101.44 → 5101.86] they could
[5101.86 → 5102.90] to have the highest score
[5102.90 → 5103.66] whether it meant
[5103.66 → 5104.58] oh well if we just
[5104.58 → 5105.40] like render that
[5105.40 → 5106.02] with a little bit
[5106.02 → 5106.70] less fidelity
[5106.70 → 5107.78] nobody will notice
[5107.78 → 5108.62] and so they were
[5108.62 → 5109.52] making specific
[5109.52 → 5110.64] optimizations
[5110.64 → 5111.46] that they were
[5111.46 → 5112.30] releasing with
[5112.30 → 5113.22] driver updates
[5113.22 → 5115.04] to 3DMark,
[5115.20 → 5116.14] a synthetic benchmark.
[5116.50 → 5117.20] A new driver
[5117.20 → 5117.84] would drop
[5117.84 → 5118.72] and it would say
[5118.72 → 5120.06] 10% improvement
[5120.06 → 5121.16] in Far Cry,
[5121.60 → 5122.94] 15% improvement
[5122.94 → 5123.96] in 3DMark
[5123.96 → 5125.34] and you'd just be like
[5125.34 → 5125.94] come on,
[5126.60 → 5127.36] you guys are really
[5127.36 → 5128.26] investing in this
[5128.26 → 5128.86] but the reality
[5128.86 → 5129.24] of it was
[5129.24 → 5129.90] especially then
[5129.90 → 5130.58] a lot of people
[5130.58 → 5131.46] were making purchasing
[5131.46 → 5132.38] decisions based on
[5132.38 → 5132.86] synthetics.
[5133.08 → 5133.20] Yeah,
[5133.74 → 5134.74] I think more than
[5134.74 → 5135.14] actually.
[5135.46 → 5135.98] More than,
[5136.14 → 5137.26] so leading us to
[5137.26 → 5138.30] well on the Android
[5138.30 → 5139.06] side I would say
[5139.06 → 5139.60] a lot of people
[5139.60 → 5140.38] are making purchasing
[5140.38 → 5141.30] decisions based on
[5141.30 → 5141.80] synthetics.
[5141.80 → 5142.66] I meant for PCs.
[5142.84 → 5142.98] Oh,
[5143.06 → 5143.98] more than now
[5143.98 → 5144.86] yeah for PCs sure
[5144.86 → 5145.54] because most people
[5145.54 → 5146.38] just don't care anymore.
[5146.56 → 5146.68] Yeah.
[5147.34 → 5148.44] So they tested
[5148.44 → 5149.54] a bunch of stuff
[5149.54 → 5150.48] so the Payphone
[5150.48 → 5151.10] from Asus,
[5151.30 → 5152.24] the HTC One,
[5152.36 → 5152.84] the One Mini,
[5152.98 → 5154.12] the G2 from LG,
[5154.72 → 5155.50] the Moto Razr
[5155.50 → 5156.46] and the basic
[5156.46 → 5157.78] conclusion guys
[5157.78 → 5159.12] is that if you're
[5159.12 → 5160.54] buying a Nexus device
[5160.54 → 5161.78] there is no cheating
[5161.78 → 5162.38] going on.
[5162.38 → 5163.18] If you're buying
[5163.18 → 5164.22] a Motorola device
[5164.22 → 5164.90] it looks like
[5164.90 → 5165.48] at least the ones
[5165.48 → 5165.98] they tested
[5165.98 → 5166.64] no guarantees
[5166.64 → 5167.30] about the other ones
[5167.30 → 5168.04] there is no cheating
[5168.04 → 5168.46] going on.
[5168.52 → 5169.06] If you were buying
[5169.06 → 5170.14] a Samsung device
[5170.14 → 5172.20] look at that Note 3.
[5172.72 → 5173.82] There is more cheating
[5173.82 → 5175.58] going on with the Note 3
[5175.58 → 5177.00] and the Note 10.1
[5177.00 → 5178.12] 2014 edition
[5178.12 → 5179.54] than any other device
[5179.54 → 5180.24] that was tested.
[5180.60 → 5181.34] Nvidia Shield
[5181.34 → 5182.86] is not doing any cheating
[5182.86 → 5184.28] but let's get into
[5184.28 → 5185.22] the technical
[5185.22 → 5187.74] sort of what is cheating
[5187.74 → 5188.62] exactly
[5188.62 → 5190.06] because this is a bit
[5190.06 → 5190.46] different.
[5190.84 → 5192.12] This isn't driver tweaks
[5192.12 → 5192.70] where you're actually
[5192.70 → 5194.02] rendering less of the image
[5194.02 → 5195.06] or doing whatever else.
[5196.36 → 5198.60] So on the Enos 5410
[5198.60 → 5200.42] Samsung was detecting
[5200.42 → 5200.98] the presence
[5200.98 → 5201.88] of certain benchmarks
[5201.88 → 5203.84] and raising thermal limits
[5203.84 → 5205.00] and thus the max GPU
[5205.00 → 5205.76] frequency in order
[5205.76 → 5206.34] to gain an edge
[5206.34 → 5207.02] on those benchmarks.
[5207.02 → 5209.22] On both the Snapdragon 600
[5209.22 → 5210.86] and the 5410
[5210.86 → 5212.50] on the Samsung Galaxy S4
[5212.50 → 5213.48] so both of those
[5213.48 → 5215.06] both Samsung Galaxy S4 platforms
[5215.06 → 5216.14] Samsung was detecting
[5216.14 → 5216.58] the presence
[5216.58 → 5217.42] of certain benchmarks
[5217.42 → 5218.62] and automatically
[5218.62 → 5219.86] driving CPU voltage
[5219.86 → 5220.46] and frequency
[5220.46 → 5221.94] to their highest state
[5221.94 → 5222.88] right away
[5222.88 → 5223.84] as opposed to
[5223.84 → 5224.92] a gradual ramp up
[5224.92 → 5225.88] and ramp down.
[5226.00 → 5226.82] And how these benchmarks
[5226.82 → 5227.82] work is they'll go
[5227.82 → 5229.10] through multiple times
[5229.10 → 5230.02] and then give you
[5230.02 → 5231.02] an overall score
[5231.02 → 5232.18] so it's going to change it
[5232.18 → 5233.14] the scale at which
[5233.14 → 5233.78] it changes it
[5233.78 → 5234.56] if you look at it
[5234.56 → 5235.22] for one run
[5235.22 → 5236.04] is a little bit
[5236.04 → 5237.24] but then over time
[5237.24 → 5238.22] it actually increases.
[5239.12 → 5239.32] Yeah.
[5240.00 → 5241.10] So basically
[5241.10 → 5241.88] they're not
[5241.88 → 5243.78] they're not lying to you
[5243.78 → 5245.00] about what your hardware
[5245.00 → 5246.10] is capable of doing.
[5246.40 → 5247.32] They're not just
[5247.32 → 5248.24] you know creating
[5248.24 → 5249.14] you know
[5249.14 → 5249.80] they're not putting
[5249.80 → 5251.10] like a piece of software
[5251.10 → 5251.82] on the phone
[5251.82 → 5253.02] that detects the benchmark
[5253.02 → 5254.76] closes it automatically
[5254.76 → 5256.22] puts up a static image
[5256.22 → 5257.14] that makes it look like
[5257.14 → 5257.72] it's running it
[5257.72 → 5258.42] and then just spits out
[5258.42 → 5258.92] a fake score.
[5259.06 → 5259.58] We're not talking
[5259.58 → 5260.64] something that blatant
[5260.64 → 5261.76] but what they're doing
[5261.76 → 5262.76] is they are manipulating
[5262.76 → 5263.42] the numbers
[5263.42 → 5264.64] to achieve
[5264.64 → 5265.68] unrealistic levels
[5265.68 → 5266.78] unrealistic levels
[5266.78 → 5267.32] of performance
[5267.32 → 5269.06] and maybe it's
[5269.06 → 5270.48] 3% here
[5270.48 → 5271.84] or 8% there
[5271.84 → 5273.26] It's not like
[5273.26 → 5274.20] doubling it
[5274.20 → 5275.46] just fabricating
[5275.46 → 5276.32] the numbers completely
[5276.32 → 5278.02] but it really feels
[5278.02 → 5278.74] unnecessary
[5278.74 → 5279.96] and I wish
[5279.96 → 5280.54] that
[5280.54 → 5281.88] that this wasn't
[5281.88 → 5282.36] the case
[5282.36 → 5283.80] but it's going to happen
[5283.80 → 5284.80] it'll keep happening
[5284.80 → 5285.58] and you know why
[5285.58 → 5286.26] it'll keep happening
[5286.26 → 5287.18] because most people
[5287.18 → 5287.72] don't care.
[5288.10 → 5288.86] You folks watching
[5288.86 → 5289.40] this show
[5289.40 → 5290.88] you probably already
[5290.88 → 5291.40] were at least
[5291.40 → 5292.48] vaguely aware of this.
[5292.48 → 5293.34] the people
[5293.34 → 5294.38] who we would be
[5294.38 → 5295.54] breaking this news to
[5295.54 → 5296.96] are not watching
[5296.96 → 5297.46] this show
[5297.46 → 5299.48] and the people
[5299.48 → 5300.72] who might be
[5300.72 → 5301.58] shopping for
[5301.58 → 5302.76] a cell phone
[5302.76 → 5304.18] probably aren't
[5304.18 → 5304.66] going to listen
[5304.66 → 5305.12] to you
[5305.12 → 5305.78] when you start
[5305.78 → 5306.44] talking about
[5306.44 → 5307.42] what benchmark
[5307.42 → 5308.68] the HTC One
[5308.68 → 5309.10] wins
[5309.10 → 5310.24] and which one
[5310.24 → 5311.28] the Galaxy S4
[5311.28 → 5311.62] wins
[5311.62 → 5312.24] because they don't
[5312.24 → 5312.72] care.
[5313.14 → 5313.60] They look at it
[5313.60 → 5313.84] and they go
[5313.84 → 5314.18] well yeah
[5314.18 → 5314.82] this one's really
[5314.82 → 5315.22] nice
[5315.22 → 5315.82] and it has a good
[5315.82 → 5316.56] battery life
[5316.56 → 5317.46] but what they
[5317.46 → 5318.62] will read into
[5318.62 → 5320.30] is the newscaster
[5320.30 → 5321.38] who quickly goes
[5321.38 → 5322.12] to some website
[5322.12 → 5323.00] finds benchmarks
[5323.00 → 5323.50] and then goes
[5323.50 → 5324.48] this is the fastest
[5324.48 → 5325.38] phone there is
[5325.38 → 5326.00] or this phone
[5326.00 → 5326.48] is faster
[5326.48 → 5327.22] than this phone
[5327.22 → 5328.22] without saying
[5328.22 → 5328.64] benchmark
[5328.64 → 5329.16] without saying
[5329.16 → 5329.92] any of the big words.
[5330.06 → 5330.50] And up till now
[5330.50 → 5331.16] my understanding
[5331.16 → 5331.98] is that Samsung
[5331.98 → 5332.90] has mostly just
[5332.90 → 5334.24] denied any optimizations
[5334.24 → 5335.94] so unless they're
[5335.94 → 5337.24] reading The Verge
[5337.24 → 5338.28] or Nantes
[5338.28 → 5339.60] versus if they're
[5339.60 → 5340.86] watching Fox News
[5340.86 → 5343.44] that tells you
[5343.44 → 5343.78] what kind of
[5343.78 → 5344.26] information they're
[5344.26 → 5344.46] going to get
[5344.46 → 5345.24] and most sites
[5345.24 → 5345.72] are just going to
[5345.72 → 5346.10] keep running
[5346.10 → 5346.52] benchmarks
[5346.52 → 5347.28] and that's all
[5347.28 → 5347.86] you can do.
[5348.12 → 5348.54] I mean this is
[5348.54 → 5349.42] very low level
[5349.42 → 5350.38] firmware programming
[5350.38 → 5351.02] that's going on
[5351.02 → 5351.64] here to change
[5351.64 → 5352.36] things like power
[5352.36 → 5353.18] states on the fly
[5353.18 → 5353.72] like this
[5353.72 → 5355.00] so you can't
[5355.00 → 5355.80] just turn that
[5355.80 → 5356.62] off and run
[5356.62 → 5357.10] the benchmark
[5357.10 → 5357.78] to get more
[5357.78 → 5358.56] legit benchmarks
[5358.56 → 5358.90] so.
[5359.30 → 5360.14] One thing they did
[5360.14 → 5360.84] was they renamed
[5360.84 → 5361.68] the executables
[5361.68 → 5362.78] oh okay
[5362.78 → 5363.68] not I guess
[5363.68 → 5365.14] the packages
[5365.14 → 5366.08] they would rename
[5366.08 → 5366.68] the benchmark
[5366.68 → 5367.34] and then it
[5367.34 → 5368.08] wouldn't detect it
[5368.08 → 5369.26] in some situations
[5369.26 → 5369.90] and then it's
[5369.90 → 5370.50] going to become
[5370.50 → 5372.00] another arms race
[5372.00 → 5373.74] where the phone
[5373.74 → 5374.34] manufacturers
[5374.34 → 5375.54] find some way
[5375.54 → 5378.58] so there you go
[5378.58 → 5379.26] and if you want
[5379.26 → 5379.96] to keep your phone
[5379.96 → 5380.42] up to date
[5380.42 → 5380.76] you're going to
[5380.76 → 5381.26] have to keep
[5381.26 → 5382.58] installing new
[5382.58 → 5383.50] ROMs and new
[5383.50 → 5384.04] updates
[5384.04 → 5385.08] and for everyone
[5385.08 → 5385.52] who's saying
[5385.52 → 5386.44] oh well I just
[5386.44 → 5386.96] you know
[5386.96 → 5388.64] I rooted my phone
[5388.64 → 5389.00] I installed
[5389.00 → 5389.24] Cassie
[5389.24 → 5389.92] good for you
[5389.92 → 5392.66] most people
[5392.66 → 5393.28] aren't going to do
[5393.28 → 5393.62] that
[5393.62 → 5395.46] my mom is not
[5395.46 → 5395.86] going to do
[5395.86 → 5396.16] that
[5396.16 → 5396.50] no
[5396.50 → 5397.80] his mom is not
[5397.80 → 5398.18] going to do
[5398.18 → 5398.42] that
[5398.42 → 5399.48] I didn't even
[5399.48 → 5400.06] bother on my
[5400.06 → 5400.46] own phone
[5400.46 → 5401.04] not because I
[5401.04 → 5401.40] don't know how
[5401.40 → 5401.72] to do it
[5401.72 → 5402.46] because I just
[5402.46 → 5403.46] don't care
[5403.46 → 5404.72] we jailbroke my
[5404.72 → 5405.30] mom's phone
[5405.30 → 5405.70] but that was
[5405.70 → 5406.44] just because she
[5406.44 → 5407.38] needed a few
[5407.38 → 5407.94] more things
[5407.94 → 5409.50] that's one way
[5409.50 → 5409.72] of putting it
[5409.72 → 5410.26] it was like a
[5410.26 → 5411.06] ancient phone
[5411.06 → 5411.88] she needed a few
[5411.88 → 5412.62] more things
[5412.62 → 5413.26] it was additional
[5413.26 → 5413.90] functionality
[5413.90 → 5415.00] ah okay
[5415.00 → 5416.12] we didn't actually
[5416.12 → 5416.82] pirate any apps
[5416.82 → 5417.06] or anything
[5417.06 → 5417.36] it was just
[5417.36 → 5418.02] additional functionality
[5418.02 → 5419.54] so Qualcomm
[5419.54 → 5420.32] claims that
[5420.32 → 5421.82] Apple's 64-bit CPU
[5421.82 → 5423.46] is a marketing gimmick
[5423.46 → 5424.16] so this was posted
[5424.16 → 5424.92] by E. Condo
[5424.92 → 5425.70] on the forum
[5425.70 → 5426.94] the original article
[5426.94 → 5427.58] is from
[5427.58 → 5430.88] news.techworld.com
[5430.88 → 5432.18] and basically
[5432.18 → 5432.86] they've come out
[5432.86 → 5433.18] and said
[5433.18 → 5433.44] look
[5433.44 → 5434.16] I think
[5434.16 → 5434.86] they're doing it
[5434.86 → 5435.82] as a marketing gimmick
[5435.82 → 5437.34] there's zero benefit
[5437.34 → 5438.14] that the consumer
[5438.14 → 5439.06] gets from that
[5439.06 → 5440.58] the benefit
[5440.58 → 5441.44] the main benefit
[5441.44 → 5442.56] of 64-bit
[5442.56 → 5443.38] is being able
[5443.38 → 5443.92] to address
[5443.92 → 5444.36] more than
[5444.36 → 5445.38] 4 gigs of memory
[5445.38 → 5446.74] and Apple
[5446.74 → 5447.54] has only equipped
[5447.54 → 5448.24] the 5S
[5448.24 → 5449.32] with one gig
[5449.32 → 5450.26] of RAM
[5450.26 → 5451.20] which means that
[5451.20 → 5452.52] on the 5S
[5452.52 → 5453.40] there is no benefit
[5453.40 → 5454.26] but this comes down
[5454.26 → 5455.02] to what we were
[5455.02 → 5455.54] talking about
[5455.54 → 5455.92] before
[5455.92 → 5456.52] which was
[5456.52 → 5457.60] what Apple's doing
[5457.60 → 5458.28] in my mind
[5458.28 → 5459.06] is preparing
[5459.06 → 5459.80] the ecosystem
[5459.80 → 5461.22] for the eventual
[5461.22 → 5461.76] move
[5461.76 → 5462.90] and paving the road
[5462.90 → 5463.54] for a smoother
[5463.54 → 5464.06] transition
[5464.06 → 5464.76] so I think
[5464.76 → 5466.78] the 64-bit chip
[5466.78 → 5467.38] may have been
[5467.38 → 5468.50] interpreted incorrectly
[5468.50 → 5469.84] but I don't think
[5469.84 → 5470.90] it was complete
[5470.90 → 5471.46] hogwash
[5471.46 → 5472.46] and had no
[5472.46 → 5473.70] no it didn't
[5473.70 → 5474.34] help consumers
[5474.34 → 5474.82] at all
[5474.82 → 5475.60] I think that's
[5475.60 → 5476.40] complete crap
[5476.40 → 5477.36] because it's
[5477.36 → 5477.76] preparing
[5477.76 → 5478.90] the whole
[5478.90 → 5479.48] ecosystem
[5479.48 → 5480.08] for later
[5480.08 → 5480.94] so when they
[5480.94 → 5481.58] will utilize
[5481.58 → 5481.98] this
[5481.98 → 5482.52] which will be
[5482.52 → 5483.22] probably pretty
[5483.22 → 5483.80] freaking soon
[5483.80 → 5484.48] to be completely
[5484.48 → 5484.92] honest
[5484.92 → 5485.86] maybe another year
[5485.86 → 5486.42] or two
[5486.42 → 5487.14] kind of thing
[5487.14 → 5487.42] yeah
[5487.42 → 5488.54] it will be ready
[5488.54 → 5489.52] and it won't be a big deal
[5489.52 → 5490.74] we saw this on the PC side
[5490.74 → 5491.88] where it was kind of terrible
[5491.88 → 5493.32] and the difference between
[5493.32 → 5494.36] Apple and Android
[5494.36 → 5495.56] at that point then
[5495.56 → 5496.60] will be that Apple
[5496.60 → 5497.68] will be able to launch
[5497.68 → 5499.68] iOS 7.5
[5499.68 → 5500.12] or 8
[5500.12 → 5500.88] or whatever they want
[5500.88 → 5501.38] call it
[5501.38 → 5502.18] and say
[5502.18 → 5503.28] backwards compatibility
[5503.28 → 5504.28] all the way back
[5504.28 → 5505.46] to 5S
[5505.46 → 5506.36] whereas
[5506.36 → 5507.94] the compatibility
[5507.94 → 5509.34] of 64-bit
[5509.34 → 5510.20] Android operating
[5510.20 → 5511.12] systems and apps
[5511.12 → 5512.42] will be so broken
[5512.42 → 5513.86] and so fragmented
[5513.86 → 5514.64] that no one will know
[5514.64 → 5515.52] what's going on
[5515.52 → 5516.88] unless you're one of that
[5516.88 → 5518.06] 0.1%
[5518.06 → 5518.98] that actually gives
[5518.98 → 5519.84] two cares about it
[5519.84 → 5520.98] and follows all this stuff
[5520.98 → 5521.34] daily
[5521.34 → 5522.24] you'll know
[5522.24 → 5523.30] but good for you
[5523.30 → 5524.92] because most people won't
[5524.92 → 5526.34] and when it comes to
[5526.34 → 5528.44] selling to the general consumer
[5528.44 → 5529.54] you have to do things
[5529.54 → 5530.74] that appeal to the general consumer
[5530.74 → 5531.36] and compatibility
[5531.36 → 5532.42] is a big one
[5532.42 → 5533.70] so I still say
[5533.70 → 5534.54] like huge thumbs up
[5534.54 → 5534.94] to Apple
[5534.94 → 5536.44] 64-bit does not inherently
[5536.44 → 5537.34] improve the performance
[5537.34 → 5538.24] the A7 chip
[5538.24 → 5539.60] the A7 chip is fast
[5539.60 → 5541.50] because the A7 chip is fast
[5541.50 → 5543.54] not because it's 64-bit
[5543.54 → 5544.38] it just happens
[5544.38 → 5545.76] to be 64-bit compatible
[5545.76 → 5547.32] and I think it's fantastic
[5547.32 → 5548.30] that moving forward
[5548.30 → 5549.38] we're going to have
[5549.38 → 5550.02] the market move
[5550.02 → 5550.52] in that direction
[5550.52 → 5551.34] yeah
[5551.34 → 5552.74] I found one of the things
[5552.74 → 5553.08] that you said
[5553.08 → 5553.68] actually interesting
[5553.68 → 5554.84] really?
[5555.24 → 5556.46] how was that for you?
[5556.78 → 5557.70] you have to let me
[5557.70 → 5558.66] finding one of the things
[5558.66 → 5559.54] that I said interesting
[5559.54 → 5559.88] I mean
[5559.88 → 5560.08] not you
[5560.08 → 5561.08] oh okay
[5561.08 → 5562.36] I generally find
[5562.36 → 5563.18] things you say interesting
[5563.18 → 5563.84] I was talking about
[5563.84 → 5565.16] the guy in the thing
[5565.16 → 5565.76] anyway
[5565.76 → 5566.84] he says
[5566.84 → 5567.80] it will have
[5567.80 → 5569.00] no real benefit
[5569.00 → 5569.70] other than
[5569.70 → 5570.30] engineering
[5570.30 → 5571.04] chip design
[5571.04 → 5572.06] and operating systems
[5572.06 → 5572.72] well wow
[5572.72 → 5573.46] that sounds like
[5573.46 → 5574.32] a pretty compelling
[5574.32 → 5575.88] list of benefits
[5575.88 → 5576.18] what?
[5576.68 → 5577.40] those things
[5577.40 → 5578.46] are really important
[5578.46 → 5579.10] like
[5579.10 → 5580.44] what are you talking about?
[5580.44 → 5581.10] I can't find
[5581.10 → 5581.66] any of those
[5581.66 → 5582.16] three things
[5582.16 → 5583.16] that is not important
[5583.16 → 5583.52] yeah
[5583.52 → 5584.24] like
[5584.24 → 5584.88] what?
[5584.88 → 5586.90] like that quote
[5586.90 → 5587.60] was just like
[5587.60 → 5588.10] okay
[5588.10 → 5588.94] really
[5588.94 → 5589.68] like
[5589.68 → 5590.84] oh man
[5590.84 → 5591.48] sorry dude
[5591.48 → 5592.30] but that's brutal
[5592.30 → 5594.14] so let's go ahead
[5594.14 → 5594.94] and move into our
[5594.94 → 5596.32] next iPhone piece of news
[5596.32 → 5597.54] so Logitech's iPhone
[5597.54 → 5598.56] game controller
[5598.56 → 5599.38] pictured again
[5599.38 → 5600.20] in a new leak
[5600.20 → 5601.48] this is all rumoured
[5601.48 → 5602.92] this isn't by any means
[5602.92 → 5603.60] release hardware
[5603.60 → 5604.64] or anything over here
[5604.64 → 5605.76] but that looks
[5605.76 → 5606.68] pretty darn cool
[5606.68 → 5607.50] it looks good
[5607.50 → 5608.42] and this plays into
[5608.42 → 5609.32] exactly what you
[5609.32 → 5610.28] just brought up
[5610.28 → 5610.86] which is where
[5610.86 → 5611.82] Nintendo might not be
[5611.82 → 5613.52] handheld manufacturer
[5613.52 → 5614.42] hardware manufacturer
[5614.42 → 5615.00] because why would they
[5615.00 → 5615.40] need to be?
[5615.52 → 5616.50] because stuff like this
[5616.50 → 5617.00] is going to start
[5617.00 → 5617.40] coming out
[5617.40 → 5618.16] and I think stuff
[5618.16 → 5619.04] even though this is
[5619.04 → 5619.62] awesome
[5619.62 → 5620.52] I think stuff
[5620.52 → 5621.28] a lot better
[5621.28 → 5622.04] than this is going
[5622.04 → 5622.42] to start coming out
[5622.42 → 5623.14] and that's the other
[5623.14 → 5623.68] thing too
[5623.68 → 5625.68] is the ridiculous
[5625.68 → 5627.18] people posting
[5627.18 → 5627.90] on that video
[5627.90 → 5628.60] saying oh well
[5628.60 → 5629.06] the touchscreen
[5629.06 → 5629.82] experience isn't
[5629.82 → 5630.10] very good
[5630.10 → 5630.72] good for you
[5630.72 → 5631.20] the touchscreen
[5631.20 → 5632.00] experience isn't
[5632.00 → 5632.36] very good
[5632.36 → 5632.76] it's not
[5632.76 → 5633.20] it's not
[5633.20 → 5633.74] not what we're
[5633.74 → 5634.24] talking about
[5634.24 → 5634.98] touchscreen experience
[5634.98 → 5635.66] like always sucks
[5635.66 → 5636.46] unless you might be
[5636.46 → 5637.18] a valve and you
[5637.18 → 5637.90] might be changing it
[5637.90 → 5638.36] and you might be
[5638.36 → 5639.08] made of magic
[5639.08 → 5640.08] yeah but that
[5640.08 → 5641.00] touchscreen experience
[5641.00 → 5641.50] that valve is
[5641.50 → 5641.86] going to have
[5641.86 → 5642.82] that's touchpad
[5642.82 → 5643.56] yeah that's not
[5643.56 → 5644.30] going to come to
[5644.30 → 5646.06] phones for at least
[5646.06 → 5647.06] a long ass time
[5647.06 → 5647.88] so you know
[5647.88 → 5648.38] you look at the
[5648.38 → 5649.08] direction things are
[5649.08 → 5649.68] moving where it
[5649.68 → 5650.24] comes to where
[5650.24 → 5651.12] we've got accessories
[5651.12 → 5651.94] that turn our
[5651.94 → 5652.84] phones into consoles
[5652.84 → 5653.66] we've got dedicated
[5653.66 → 5654.74] devices like shield
[5654.74 → 5655.90] that turn that
[5655.90 → 5657.22] ecosystem into a
[5657.22 → 5657.64] console
[5657.64 → 5658.96] oh sorry to throw
[5658.96 → 5659.88] back another thing
[5659.88 → 5660.84] shield didn't cheat
[5660.84 → 5661.14] either
[5661.14 → 5662.08] yeah shield didn't
[5662.08 → 5662.96] I did mention that
[5662.96 → 5663.46] okay, okay
[5663.46 → 5664.70] yeah Nvidia did not
[5664.70 → 5665.44] cheat with the
[5665.44 → 5666.62] Tagger 4 and I
[5666.62 → 5667.34] think that really
[5667.34 → 5668.52] speaks to how much
[5668.52 → 5669.24] they've grown up
[5669.24 → 5669.70] yeah
[5669.70 → 5671.28] in the last five
[5671.28 → 5672.02] to eight years
[5672.02 → 5673.36] where they were
[5673.36 → 5674.04] as guilty as
[5674.04 → 5674.96] AMD at times
[5674.96 → 5676.44] like real guilty
[5676.44 → 5677.02] yeah
[5677.02 → 5678.66] and now here
[5678.66 → 5679.38] you know no one
[5679.38 → 5679.70] was really
[5679.70 → 5680.48] investigating this
[5680.48 → 5680.96] at the time
[5680.96 → 5681.56] but they basically
[5681.56 → 5682.64] said look Tagger 4
[5682.64 → 5683.36] kicks ass
[5683.36 → 5684.16] and it's going to
[5684.16 → 5684.86] kick ass without
[5684.86 → 5685.74] us making any
[5685.74 → 5687.04] optimizations for
[5687.04 → 5688.04] particular applications
[5688.04 → 5688.66] which is really cool
[5688.66 → 5689.82] kudos to you Nvidia
[5689.82 → 5690.94] love to see that
[5690.94 → 5692.74] all right so
[5692.74 → 5693.70] here's a quick
[5693.70 → 5694.60] discussion topic
[5694.60 → 5695.90] and that is
[5695.90 → 5698.98] the Leon
[5698.98 → 5699.62] versus
[5699.62 → 5700.54] core series
[5700.54 → 5701.12] processors
[5701.12 → 5702.10] so there's a lot
[5702.10 → 5702.66] of confusion
[5702.66 → 5703.18] about this
[5703.18 → 5703.88] so the Leon
[5703.88 → 5704.54] e3
[5704.54 → 5705.30] yeah I know
[5705.30 → 5705.90] I'm in Canada
[5705.90 → 5706.44] I don't care
[5706.44 → 5707.60] the Leon
[5707.60 → 5708.12] e3
[5708.12 → 5710.60] oh I hate it
[5710.60 → 5711.60] when it does
[5711.60 → 5712.54] that to me
[5712.54 → 5713.56] stop it
[5713.56 → 5714.84] I know I'm in
[5714.84 → 5715.14] Canada
[5715.14 → 5716.34] don't redirect me
[5716.34 → 5717.10] to the home page
[5717.10 → 5718.26] I want to actually
[5718.26 → 5719.10] look at this page
[5719.10 → 5720.44] so what is the
[5720.44 → 5721.10] difference between
[5721.10 → 5721.86] a Leon and a
[5721.86 → 5722.88] core series processor
[5722.88 → 5723.86] so there's a couple
[5723.86 → 5724.70] of different things
[5724.70 → 5725.74] first
[5725.74 → 5726.58] right now there
[5726.58 → 5727.64] happens to be a
[5727.64 → 5728.82] particularly interesting
[5728.82 → 5729.70] Leon which I can't
[5729.70 → 5730.42] remember the model
[5730.42 → 5730.90] number of
[5730.90 → 5731.50] because it's crazy
[5731.50 → 5732.04] right now
[5732.04 → 5733.66] and of course
[5733.66 → 5734.82] this isn't working
[5734.82 → 5736.36] because I bet my
[5736.36 → 5737.12] phone battery
[5737.12 → 5738.08] just died
[5738.08 → 5740.04] oh it's one thing
[5740.04 → 5740.90] after another today
[5740.90 → 5741.96] so it's the e3
[5741.96 → 5742.80] something or other
[5742.80 → 5743.78] it's clocked 100
[5743.78 → 5744.60] megahertz slower
[5744.60 → 5745.62] than the core series
[5745.62 → 5746.14] equivalent
[5746.14 → 5748.06] and what's the
[5748.06 → 5748.40] difference
[5748.40 → 5749.42] so number one
[5749.42 → 5750.30] is that Leon's
[5750.30 → 5751.04] aren't officially
[5751.04 → 5751.94] supported by some
[5751.94 → 5752.28] boards
[5752.28 → 5753.38] with that said
[5753.38 → 5754.46] I've yet to see
[5754.46 → 5756.04] an electrically
[5756.04 → 5756.68] compatible board
[5756.68 → 5757.04] that doesn't
[5757.04 → 5757.40] support it
[5757.40 → 5758.60] they always work
[5758.60 → 5759.20] they're just not
[5759.20 → 5760.26] like officially
[5760.26 → 5760.84] supported
[5760.84 → 5761.36] but they always
[5761.36 → 5761.62] work
[5761.62 → 5761.82] yeah
[5761.82 → 5762.96] number two
[5762.96 → 5763.42] is there's no
[5763.42 → 5764.24] integrated GPU
[5764.24 → 5765.40] so Intel has
[5765.40 → 5766.14] fused it off
[5766.14 → 5766.80] because they
[5766.80 → 5767.20] I guess they
[5767.20 → 5767.80] figure people
[5767.80 → 5768.64] who want those
[5768.64 → 5769.42] Eons don't need
[5769.42 → 5770.40] integrated graphics
[5770.40 → 5770.98] which I think is
[5770.98 → 5771.36] crazy
[5771.36 → 5772.38] because that's
[5772.38 → 5773.04] one of the reasons
[5773.04 → 5773.68] I have against
[5773.68 → 5774.12] getting one
[5774.12 → 5774.68] is if I wanted
[5774.68 → 5775.44] to use it for a
[5775.44 → 5776.14] server later on
[5776.14 → 5776.76] I'd want it to
[5776.76 → 5777.70] have integrated graphics
[5777.70 → 5778.46] okay
[5778.46 → 5779.48] base clock
[5779.48 → 5780.78] overclocking only
[5780.78 → 5782.20] which is fairly
[5782.20 → 5783.66] limited compared
[5783.66 → 5784.42] to being able
[5784.42 → 5784.98] to overclock
[5784.98 → 5785.46] the multiplier
[5785.46 → 5786.28] even on non
[5786.28 → 5786.98] unlocked skews
[5786.98 → 5787.66] you can overclock
[5787.66 → 5788.18] the multiplier
[5788.18 → 5788.84] a fair bit
[5788.84 → 5790.56] on modern CPUs
[5790.56 → 5791.46] and on Haswell
[5791.46 → 5791.92] since they don't
[5791.92 → 5792.90] overclock that high
[5792.90 → 5794.38] you might be
[5794.38 → 5795.02] getting pretty close
[5795.02 → 5795.56] to the maximum
[5795.56 → 5796.30] without even getting
[5796.30 → 5797.12] an unlocked CPU
[5797.12 → 5798.60] it doesn't need
[5798.60 → 5799.50] ECC memory
[5799.50 → 5800.64] but it can use
[5800.64 → 5801.32] ECC memory
[5801.32 → 5801.98] unlike the core
[5801.98 → 5802.84] series processors
[5802.84 → 5804.34] so someone was
[5804.34 → 5804.94] basically just
[5804.94 → 5805.64] asking me
[5805.64 → 5806.62] well is there
[5806.62 → 5807.22] any compelling
[5807.22 → 5807.98] reason why I
[5807.98 → 5808.72] should get a
[5808.72 → 5809.60] core series processor
[5809.60 → 5810.26] versus a Leon
[5810.26 → 5810.72] if it's like
[5810.72 → 5811.42] 50 bucks cheaper
[5811.42 → 5811.96] and I was kind of
[5811.96 → 5813.32] like let me look
[5813.32 → 5813.88] into this
[5813.88 → 5815.54] the answer seems
[5815.54 → 5816.00] to be if you
[5816.00 → 5816.48] don't need the
[5816.48 → 5817.26] onboard graphics
[5817.26 → 5818.10] and you don't
[5818.10 → 5818.68] want to overclock
[5818.68 → 5819.18] not really
[5819.18 → 5820.22] yeah
[5820.22 → 5821.08] make sure your
[5821.08 → 5821.86] board supports it
[5821.86 → 5822.42] in fact many
[5822.42 → 5822.88] boards even
[5822.88 → 5823.46] consumer ones
[5823.46 → 5824.08] do officially
[5824.08 → 5824.92] support Leon's
[5824.92 → 5825.88] yeah yeah
[5825.88 → 5826.84] just not
[5826.84 → 5828.68] everyone officially
[5828.68 → 5829.36] supports Leon's
[5829.36 → 5829.74] that's all
[5829.74 → 5831.14] but like
[5831.14 → 5831.80] this has actually
[5831.80 → 5832.54] been pretty crazy
[5832.54 → 5833.04] on the forums
[5833.04 → 5833.32] lately
[5833.32 → 5833.76] I don't know
[5833.76 → 5834.18] if you've noticed
[5834.18 → 5834.72] that but people
[5834.72 → 5835.06] have been going
[5835.06 → 5835.74] nuts over these
[5835.74 → 5836.28] two processors
[5836.28 → 5837.02] and like yeah
[5837.02 → 5838.48] if you have no
[5838.48 → 5839.44] plan on overclocking
[5839.44 → 5840.38] and you have
[5840.38 → 5841.50] 100% of a plan
[5841.50 → 5842.26] to always have
[5842.26 → 5842.86] a video card
[5842.86 → 5843.78] with that processor
[5843.78 → 5844.54] all the time
[5844.54 → 5844.92] like you're going
[5844.92 → 5845.34] to pair them
[5845.34 → 5845.72] together
[5845.72 → 5847.56] then yeah
[5847.56 → 5847.98] it's fine
[5847.98 → 5849.92] personally I like
[5849.92 → 5850.86] getting processors
[5850.86 → 5851.36] that have
[5851.36 → 5852.14] integrated graphics
[5852.14 → 5852.82] if I'm going to
[5852.82 → 5853.40] get it on a
[5853.40 → 5854.38] non-like crazy
[5854.38 → 5855.20] enthusiast platform
[5855.20 → 5855.74] so if I'm not
[5855.74 → 5856.38] going to get 2011
[5856.38 → 5858.48] I'm probably going
[5858.48 → 5859.04] to want the option
[5859.04 → 5859.86] for integrated graphics
[5859.86 → 5861.06] because at some
[5861.06 → 5861.56] point in time
[5861.56 → 5862.28] I might take that
[5862.28 → 5862.98] system and throw it
[5862.98 → 5863.80] in a server environment
[5863.80 → 5864.34] who knows
[5864.34 → 5865.28] there's other
[5865.28 → 5866.34] stuff that uses it
[5866.34 → 5867.28] I mean things like
[5867.28 → 5868.86] things like video
[5868.86 → 5869.28] encoding
[5869.28 → 5870.00] quick sync
[5870.00 → 5871.60] anything that's
[5871.60 → 5871.94] going to take
[5871.94 → 5872.42] advantage of
[5872.42 → 5872.92] OpenCL
[5872.92 → 5873.44] is going to
[5873.44 → 5874.00] benefit from
[5874.00 → 5874.40] the onboard
[5874.40 → 5874.86] graphics
[5874.86 → 5875.42] whether it's
[5875.42 → 5876.50] Intel or AMD
[5876.50 → 5877.28] although AMD's
[5877.28 → 5877.86] onboard graphics
[5877.86 → 5878.28] are quite a bit
[5878.28 → 5878.84] more powerful
[5878.84 → 5880.34] and I can't
[5880.34 → 5881.24] find a micro USB
[5881.24 → 5882.02] charging cable
[5882.02 → 5882.70] which means
[5882.70 → 5884.00] that our
[5884.00 → 5886.08] PowerPoint for
[5886.08 → 5886.64] build of the
[5886.64 → 5887.54] week is going
[5887.54 → 5887.80] to be a bit
[5887.80 → 5888.20] of a challenge
[5888.20 → 5888.74] so we'll be back
[5888.74 → 5889.22] in just a moment
[5889.22 → 5890.96] oh we can do
[5890.96 → 5891.26] that
[5891.26 → 5892.64] wait where are
[5892.64 → 5894.90] we
[5894.90 → 5896.96] our builds
[5896.96 → 5897.38] of the week
[5897.38 → 5897.86] this week
[5897.86 → 5898.94] are freaking
[5898.94 → 5899.74] awesome
[5899.74 → 5900.40] so the first
[5900.40 → 5901.20] one is Arctic
[5901.20 → 5902.12] water from B
[5902.12 → 5902.76] negative and
[5902.76 → 5903.28] there's nothing
[5903.28 → 5904.12] negative about it
[5904.12 → 5905.00] holy balls
[5905.00 → 5906.70] so this was
[5906.70 → 5907.38] built for
[5907.38 → 5908.10] someone else
[5908.10 → 5909.04] I think it was
[5909.04 → 5909.84] on the OC3D
[5909.84 → 5910.62] forums but like
[5910.62 → 5910.98] when you're
[5910.98 → 5911.74] building something
[5911.74 → 5912.84] for someone else
[5912.84 → 5913.54] that is already
[5913.54 → 5914.44] on a tech forum
[5914.44 → 5915.84] like your kind of
[5915.84 → 5916.26] know it's going
[5916.26 → 5916.64] to be pretty
[5916.64 → 5917.08] awesome
[5917.08 → 5918.10] unbelievable
[5918.10 → 5919.00] I mean even
[5919.00 → 5920.26] replacing all of
[5920.26 → 5921.02] the connectors
[5921.02 → 5922.70] on the PCI
[5922.70 → 5923.68] express slots
[5923.68 → 5924.82] painting the
[5924.82 → 5925.80] shroud on the
[5925.80 → 5926.42] safer tooth
[5926.42 → 5926.80] board
[5926.80 → 5928.12] painting that
[5928.12 → 5928.84] memory
[5928.84 → 5930.62] that hard piped
[5930.62 → 5931.66] copper tubing
[5931.66 → 5932.64] I mean oh
[5932.64 → 5933.92] it's its
[5933.92 → 5934.50] orgasmic
[5934.50 → 5935.34] and then once you
[5935.34 → 5935.98] go to the next
[5935.98 → 5937.04] photo you can
[5937.04 → 5937.92] actually see even
[5937.92 → 5938.84] the ring on the
[5938.84 → 5939.64] Corsair fans
[5939.64 → 5940.82] different accent
[5940.82 → 5942.02] points on the
[5942.02 → 5942.50] safer tooth
[5942.50 → 5942.86] motherboard
[5942.86 → 5944.40] like what a
[5944.40 → 5945.28] beautiful machine
[5945.28 → 5946.08] attention to
[5946.08 → 5946.96] freaking detail
[5946.96 → 5948.22] what an absolutely
[5948.22 → 5949.12] beautiful machine
[5949.12 → 5949.90] grill here
[5949.90 → 5951.40] wow
[5951.40 → 5953.34] and it's the one
[5953.34 → 5953.96] system I've ever
[5953.96 → 5954.52] seen where the
[5954.52 → 5955.26] stock crossfire
[5955.26 → 5955.98] bridge looks like
[5955.98 → 5956.76] it's not completely
[5956.76 → 5957.42] out of place
[5957.42 → 5959.56] it's pretty awesome
[5959.56 → 5960.56] next up this one's
[5960.56 → 5961.06] been in the works
[5961.06 → 5961.94] for a long time
[5961.94 → 5962.80] from P Banes
[5962.80 → 5963.90] the custom water
[5963.90 → 5965.18] cooled desk
[5965.18 → 5967.14] boom
[5967.14 → 5968.30] so cool
[5968.30 → 5969.02] and then one
[5969.02 → 5969.46] thing that I
[5969.46 → 5970.68] always worry about
[5970.68 → 5971.16] with these desks
[5971.16 → 5972.94] and actually we
[5972.94 → 5973.64] talked about this
[5973.64 → 5974.32] in one of my
[5974.32 → 5975.22] private little
[5975.22 → 5976.40] not private but
[5976.40 → 5977.40] my solo live
[5977.40 → 5978.54] streams a while
[5978.54 → 5979.22] ago when this
[5979.22 → 5979.94] was in production
[5979.94 → 5980.62] which we brought
[5980.62 → 5981.02] this up and
[5981.02 → 5981.48] everyone instead
[5981.48 → 5981.90] of me playing
[5981.90 → 5982.40] a game was just
[5982.40 → 5983.00] looking at this
[5983.00 → 5983.96] build which is
[5983.96 → 5985.16] ridiculous but I
[5985.16 → 5985.64] brought up something
[5985.64 → 5986.22] that always worries
[5986.22 → 5986.76] me about these
[5986.76 → 5987.76] taller desk builds
[5987.76 → 5988.54] which is like
[5988.54 → 5989.06] where do you put
[5989.06 → 5989.44] your legs
[5989.44 → 5989.90] what it means is
[5989.90 → 5991.46] like the tallness
[5991.46 → 5992.04] of the height
[5992.04 → 5992.50] here
[5992.50 → 5992.90] yeah
[5992.90 → 5994.08] so it's like
[5994.08 → 5994.54] where do you put
[5994.54 → 5995.14] your legs and
[5995.14 → 5995.70] then how do your
[5995.70 → 5996.94] arms like if it's
[5996.94 → 5997.56] tall enough your legs
[5997.56 → 5998.22] are your arms up
[5998.22 → 5999.68] here, and he has a
[5999.68 → 6000.20] photo of it and
[6000.20 → 6000.98] he actually kind of
[6000.98 → 6002.06] slots in fairly well
[6002.06 → 6002.88] okay and then he
[6002.88 → 6003.72] also brought up that
[6003.72 → 6004.24] he's going to be
[6004.24 → 6004.98] putting his keyboard
[6004.98 → 6005.86] and mouse probably on
[6005.86 → 6006.64] the tray anyway
[6006.64 → 6007.86] right so that
[6007.86 → 6008.96] totally makes sense
[6008.96 → 6011.18] that's just a wicked
[6011.18 → 6012.18] build look at that
[6012.18 → 6012.66] it's amazing
[6012.66 → 6013.90] sleeving and these
[6013.90 → 6015.64] I love that nice
[6015.64 → 6017.68] straight runs of
[6017.68 → 6020.00] of um a vinyl tubing
[6020.00 → 6021.52] or a flexible tubing
[6021.52 → 6023.64] look outstanding it
[6023.64 → 6024.82] looks so good
[6024.82 → 6026.84] oh all them right
[6026.84 → 6028.08] angles and man
[6028.08 → 6028.84] and he was even
[6028.84 → 6030.20] super super super
[6030.20 → 6030.94] careful about the
[6030.94 → 6031.88] colour of his coolant
[6031.88 → 6032.56] too it's great that's
[6032.56 → 6033.36] not the last picture
[6033.36 → 6034.68] oh, oh okay
[6034.68 → 6035.40] there's one more
[6035.40 → 6036.54] it's not like a
[6036.54 → 6037.78] super crazy picture
[6037.78 → 6038.76] of the insides but
[6038.76 → 6039.22] I just wanted to
[6039.22 → 6040.28] show how like he
[6040.28 → 6041.22] actually does kind of
[6041.22 → 6041.90] fit now it's pretty
[6041.90 → 6043.10] tight, but he did say
[6043.10 → 6043.56] that he's going to
