[0.00 --> 3.00]  Alright, welcome to the after party. We have acquired...
[3.00 --> 4.00]  Uh...
[4.00 --> 5.00]  Eating a lot, guys.
[5.00 --> 6.00]  And about...
[7.00 --> 10.00]  14 pounds of blueberries.
[10.00 --> 12.00]  Which I don't know if you guys can see this.
[12.00 --> 14.00]  But it's friggin' awesome.
[14.00 --> 18.00]  And Slick brought crackers, which I really hope he's gonna share with me.
[18.00 --> 19.00]  Crackers and hummus.
[19.00 --> 21.00]  Crackers and hummus is good.
[21.00 --> 22.00]  Okay.
[22.00 --> 23.00]  And it's like fairly filling.
[23.00 --> 24.00]  I'm down for some crackers and hummus.
[24.00 --> 25.00]  And yes, you can have some.
[25.00 --> 27.00]  Is hummus anything like Hummers?
[27.00 --> 28.00]  No.
[28.00 --> 29.00]  It's crushed chickpeas, isn't it?
[29.00 --> 31.00]  Because I wouldn't want you to give me a Hummer.
[31.00 --> 33.00]  They're not very good on gas.
[33.00 --> 34.00]  Wow.
[34.00 --> 36.00]  I think it's crushed chickpeas.
[36.00 --> 37.00]  Yeah.
[37.00 --> 39.00]  I wish I had a garbage can.
[39.00 --> 40.00]  Oh, there's one.
[40.00 --> 41.00]  There we go.
[41.00 --> 42.00]  Alright.
[42.00 --> 45.00]  Someone asks why we don't stream in 1080p.
[45.00 --> 47.00]  Uh, it's because our computer sucks.
[47.00 --> 48.00]  No.
[48.00 --> 49.00]  I thought it was the...
[49.00 --> 51.00]  Well, that's the other reason.
[51.00 --> 55.00]  But remember, ever since we switched to the LGA 1156 platform, it also tells us we can't stream in 1080p.
[55.00 --> 56.00]  Yeah.
[56.00 --> 58.00]  Which is like, genius.
[58.00 --> 65.00]  So we're gonna open up with some wicked awesome NHL PA 93.
[65.00 --> 69.00]  Speaking of which, did you hear the news that, what is it?
[69.00 --> 78.00]  NHL 2014 is gonna have a retro mode that allows you to play basically like no strategy, old school style, like NHL 94.
[78.00 --> 80.00]  Like it's anniversary mode is what they're calling it.
[80.00 --> 83.00]  So it's gonna be, um, in person only.
[83.00 --> 85.00]  No online play.
[85.00 --> 86.00]  But like, yeah.
[86.00 --> 90.00]  No strategy, no like, um...
[90.00 --> 91.00]  That's awesome.
[91.00 --> 92.00]  Whatever.
[92.00 --> 93.00]  Yeah.
[93.00 --> 94.00]  It's awesome.
[94.00 --> 96.00]  Like, uh, fighting...
[96.00 --> 98.00]  More options is like pretty much never better.
[98.00 --> 99.00]  Sometimes it is.
[99.00 --> 100.00]  I mean, never worse.
[100.00 --> 106.00]  So you can just turn off offsides, turn off icing, just kinda go at it and just play.
[106.00 --> 107.00]  Cool.
[107.00 --> 108.00]  Cause why not, right?
[108.00 --> 110.00]  I think that's outstanding.
[110.00 --> 111.00]  I love it.
[111.00 --> 114.00]  My laptop battery died during the stream there.
[114.00 --> 117.00]  So I'm just gonna fire it up and get, uh, get Twitch chat going.
[117.00 --> 118.00]  Let's see it.
[118.00 --> 119.00]  Okay.
[119.00 --> 124.00]  This on-screen keyboard needs to die in a fire.
[124.00 --> 132.00]  Let's just see if, uh, Twitch chat can, can detect my presence.
[132.00 --> 135.00]  I was all like, hey y'all!
[135.00 --> 138.00]  Quick second, because I think the Steam sales might have rolled over.
[138.00 --> 139.00]  Oh really?
[139.00 --> 140.00]  The Flash ones.
[140.00 --> 142.00]  Not the daily ones, but the Flash sales.
[142.00 --> 143.00]  Ooh.
[143.00 --> 147.00]  Okay, I'm gonna have to reload this page anyway, cause this isn't working.
[147.00 --> 149.00]  So welcome to the after party.
[149.00 --> 151.00]  You can see we have like a fancy graphic now.
[151.00 --> 154.00]  So there's one down here with some paint splatters on it.
[154.00 --> 158.00]  And then there's like a WAN show after party thing way over there on the other side.
[158.00 --> 163.00]  We're also done with like being incredibly slow.
[163.00 --> 164.00]  Um.
[164.00 --> 166.00]  About turning the after party on.
[166.00 --> 167.00]  About turning the after party on.
[167.00 --> 169.00]  It's taken half an hour to an hour in the past.
[169.00 --> 170.00]  Yeah, I know.
[170.00 --> 171.00]  This one took-
[171.00 --> 172.00]  It's ridiculous.
[172.00 --> 173.00]  The last time it took us to grab food.
[173.00 --> 174.00]  Yeah.
[174.00 --> 175.00]  So we just needed food.
[175.00 --> 178.00]  And so from now on that laptop lives there.
[178.00 --> 180.00]  So that's the laptop we're gonna use for gaming.
[180.00 --> 183.00]  And for all of your bashing gaming laptops.
[183.00 --> 185.00]  That has a 5870M in it.
[185.00 --> 187.00]  Can play games.
[187.00 --> 189.00]  It's like a two year old gaming laptop.
[189.00 --> 194.00]  And I think it's less true that they suck now than it was maybe three years ago.
[194.00 --> 195.00]  Yes, for sure.
[195.00 --> 196.00]  And one thing.
[196.00 --> 198.00]  You've complained about this in the past.
[198.00 --> 199.00]  It's super heavy to lug around.
[199.00 --> 200.00]  Okay, yes.
[200.00 --> 203.00]  For me, I don't necessarily want a gaming laptop because if I'm on the road.
[203.00 --> 204.00]  You're not gaming.
[204.00 --> 205.00]  I'm not gaming.
[205.00 --> 207.00]  And if I am gaming, I'll just bring along-
[207.00 --> 208.00]  You're just not hardcore enough.
[208.00 --> 215.00]  If I am gaming, I'll just bring along a mobile DS or something.
[215.00 --> 217.00]  And that's fine.
[217.00 --> 219.00]  So I understand gaming laptops.
[219.00 --> 223.00]  I've recommended gaming laptops to people before as people who want desktop replacements.
[223.00 --> 224.00]  Right.
[224.00 --> 226.00]  Because they're way too mobile.
[226.00 --> 229.00]  And they don't care about having something that they just have to lug around.
[229.00 --> 230.00]  Although you don't need to do that anymore.
[230.00 --> 232.00]  That Bizio notebook is awesome.
[232.00 --> 233.00]  Yeah.
[233.00 --> 235.00]  Thin and light, quad core.
[235.00 --> 242.00]  Something I'd consider, like in terms of the actual sheer power of it, something that's more like a desktop replacement than...
[242.00 --> 243.00]  Yep.
[244.00 --> 245.00]  Definitely.
[246.00 --> 247.00]  Ooh.
[247.00 --> 248.00]  Then like a thin light.
[248.00 --> 249.00]  What kind of games you got on there?
[249.00 --> 255.00]  So far I have a few, but the flash sales, Bully Scholarship Edition just went up on a flash sale.
[255.00 --> 256.00]  I had just bought it.
[256.00 --> 257.00]  Oh really?
[257.00 --> 258.00]  Yeah.
[258.00 --> 259.00]  How much did you pay?
[259.00 --> 260.00]  I think it was $4.50.
[260.00 --> 261.00]  It's not a big deal.
[261.00 --> 262.00]  Oh, so you...
[262.00 --> 264.00]  Okay, so it's a difference of like a dollar.
[264.00 --> 265.00]  Still.
[265.00 --> 266.00]  I knew I should have waited.
[266.00 --> 267.00]  You are the cheapest person I know.
[267.00 --> 268.00]  I've been waiting.
[268.00 --> 269.00]  Actually, you're the second cheapest person I know.
[269.00 --> 275.00]  I've been adding games that I find interesting to a notepad for six months waiting for the summer sale.
[275.00 --> 278.00]  So I'm like, nah, I'm just gonna wanna buy it later.
[278.00 --> 280.00]  I have games I can play right now.
[280.00 --> 282.00]  You are absolutely ridiculous.
[282.00 --> 284.00]  So like I know I'm gonna spend money on the summer sale.
[284.00 --> 286.00]  But, and like a lot.
[286.00 --> 289.00]  But, I haven't spent money on games in so long.
[289.00 --> 292.00]  Because I have a notepad on my computer that's super long.
[292.00 --> 295.00]  Because it's just all the games I've been interested in.
[295.00 --> 296.00]  You know what is funny?
[296.00 --> 303.00]  That system is exactly the same one that my wife uses for like tracking things and then getting them when they're cheap.
[303.00 --> 310.00]  You two are the cheapest people I know.
[310.00 --> 318.00]  Although, my ultimate cheapness story is not actually about either you or my wife.
[318.00 --> 319.00]  Have you heard this one before?
[319.00 --> 320.00]  The tuna one?
[320.00 --> 321.00]  Yes.
[321.00 --> 322.00]  Yeah.
[322.00 --> 326.00]  So the tuna story is NCIX Esther.
[326.00 --> 327.00]  Get this.
[327.00 --> 333.00]  I'm at Subway with my wife who is Esther's sister for those of you who don't know.
[333.00 --> 335.00]  We should actually play a game at some point here.
[335.00 --> 337.00]  I think this is supposed to be a gaming stream.
[337.00 --> 339.00]  So I'm pretty sure I'm player one.
[339.00 --> 340.00]  But I'm gonna be Vancouver.
[340.00 --> 341.00]  You pick whatever you want.
[341.00 --> 343.00]  Do you wanna play an all star game?
[343.00 --> 344.00]  Sure.
[344.00 --> 346.00]  Okay, I'll take all star west.
[346.00 --> 349.00]  All star east.
[349.00 --> 352.00]  Period length, five minutes, only fighting, line changes off.
[352.00 --> 354.00]  So I'm at Subway.
[354.00 --> 358.00]  And my wife's like, oh, should we get something for Esther?
[358.00 --> 360.00]  And I'm like, yeah, sure, whatever, that's cool.
[360.00 --> 364.00]  Oh, I'm on top this time.
[364.00 --> 367.00]  And I'm like, yeah, sure, whatever.
[367.00 --> 369.00]  So she calls Esther.
[369.00 --> 370.00]  She's like, what kind of sandwich do you want?
[370.00 --> 373.00]  Esther's like, get this, veggie sub.
[373.00 --> 377.00]  And I was like, oh, the veggie sub actually isn't that great of a value.
[377.00 --> 379.00]  Why are you getting that?
[379.00 --> 382.00]  And she's like, I was like, yeah, it's not filling at all.
[382.00 --> 383.00]  And she's like, no, no, it's okay.
[383.00 --> 385.00]  I have my own tuna in my office.
[385.00 --> 389.00]  Just like, oh, oh, Stephen scores.
[389.00 --> 390.00]  Oh, Stephen scores.
[390.00 --> 397.00]  Add your own tuna to a veggie sub so that you can save like the 40 cents or whatever.
[397.00 --> 404.00]  That is the difference between buying a can of tuna and buying a sub at Subway with tuna on it in the first place.
[404.00 --> 410.00]  It's like the most ludicrous thing that I heard like in that calendar year for sure.
[410.00 --> 413.00]  Possibly longer than that calendar year.
[413.00 --> 420.00]  Speaking of ludicrous things, I was making some canned juice the other night.
[420.00 --> 427.00]  And I discovered that Minute Maid has a product that they actually don't call juice.
[427.00 --> 429.00]  They don't call it punch.
[429.00 --> 431.00]  They don't call it drink.
[431.00 --> 432.00]  That's what that is.
[432.00 --> 433.00]  It's just called fruit.
[433.00 --> 434.00]  That's Minute Maid fruit.
[434.00 --> 435.00]  That's the same thing.
[435.00 --> 436.00]  I knew it.
[436.00 --> 439.00]  And what it, I can't put my finger on what exactly it tastes like.
[439.00 --> 440.00]  Other than fruit.
[440.00 --> 444.00]  They say, they have the, like, they have what it's supposed to taste like on it.
[444.00 --> 445.00]  Well, I know what's in it.
[445.00 --> 447.00]  My own guy just tripped me.
[447.00 --> 449.00]  I know, that was awesome.
[449.00 --> 454.00]  This is why, this is why All Stars West is like so legit compared to All Stars East.
[454.00 --> 461.00]  I should check and see if we have any of our interesting after party topics of discussion.
[461.00 --> 471.00]  So you actually recently turned me on to Game Grumps, which I had never watched before because I apparently live in a shack with no internet in the middle of nowhere.
[471.00 --> 478.00]  Honestly though, it's kind of hard for me to find time to like, go look for streams to watch.
[478.00 --> 484.00]  But, one of the things that I think you're probably not going to agree with me about is, I don't think Danny's that bad.
[484.00 --> 487.00]  No, wait, I sent you a message about this.
[487.00 --> 489.00]  I don't think you got it on Skype.
[489.00 --> 492.00]  Um, oh, was that a crossbar?
[492.00 --> 494.00]  I have no idea what that was.
[494.00 --> 497.00]  I didn't even know that was possible in this game.
[497.00 --> 498.00]  What?
[498.00 --> 499.00]  Oh yeah, they have posts.
[499.00 --> 502.00]  I didn't know you could crossbar though, that's ridiculous.
[502.00 --> 504.00]  Anyways, he's not as good right now.
[504.00 --> 508.00]  And one of the things was, the only episode I had seen with him was his first one.
[508.00 --> 509.00]  So you didn't even give a chance.
[509.00 --> 511.00]  That's not fair, yeah.
[511.00 --> 515.00]  Um, I eventually watched episodes after that.
[515.00 --> 517.00]  He had already improved a ton.
[517.00 --> 525.00]  And I think the main differences between him and JonTron right now is that JonTron and Egoraptor have been working together for so long that they meshed really well.
[525.00 --> 526.00]  Right.
[526.00 --> 529.00]  And I don't think they meshed super well yet.
[529.00 --> 535.00]  So it's basically like that guy who keeps telling me to take you off the show, not giving you a chance.
[535.00 --> 539.00]  Except that he's already given you like a year, so actually it's not the same thing at all.
[539.00 --> 540.00]  He's probably right.
[540.00 --> 542.00]  First of all, it hasn't been a year.
[542.00 --> 543.00]  Hasn't it?
[543.00 --> 544.00]  That's pretty much it, no.
[544.00 --> 546.00]  Oh no, I guess it hasn't.
[546.00 --> 548.00]  Because it'll be a year in wintertime.
[548.00 --> 551.00]  I don't know exactly in wintertime when...
[551.00 --> 554.00]  Sometime in October, November.
[554.00 --> 560.00]  I was actually marveling the other day that the WAN show, or the livestream, whichever you prefer to call it...
[560.00 --> 564.00]  Actually, everyone prefers to call it WAN show from now on, by law.
[564.00 --> 565.00]  Um...
[565.00 --> 566.00]  What?
[566.00 --> 569.00]  The WAN show has been running for almost a year now.
[569.00 --> 572.00]  I started it in, I think, July last year.
[572.00 --> 573.00]  Isn't that crazy?
[573.00 --> 575.00]  That is actually pretty crazy.
[575.00 --> 576.00]  How are you not?
[576.00 --> 577.00]  This door...
[577.00 --> 578.00]  Pshhh!
[578.00 --> 580.00]  Aw, come on, come on, come on, come on!
[580.00 --> 581.00]  Rebound!
[581.00 --> 582.00]  Aw!
[582.00 --> 585.00]  Did you hear about the flooding in Toronto?
[585.00 --> 587.00]  Yep, um, one thing.
[587.00 --> 588.00]  I know a guy that lives there.
[588.00 --> 590.00]  Um, he said a lot of the pictures...
[590.00 --> 591.00]  Is that the one that's moving here?
[591.00 --> 592.00]  Yeah.
[592.00 --> 593.00]  Okay.
[593.00 --> 596.00]  A lot of the pictures are not as bad as it actually is.
[596.00 --> 601.00]  Because a lot of the pictures that are getting out are pictures of roads that are right beside rivers.
[601.00 --> 602.00]  Oh, okay.
[602.00 --> 605.00]  So it's specifically those roads that are bad.
[605.00 --> 609.00]  But people that live there know that those roads are bad and are avoiding them generally.
[609.00 --> 610.00]  Oh, okay.
[610.00 --> 612.00]  So there's a little bit of sensationalist reporting going on here.
[612.00 --> 615.00]  Like, there is flooding in Toronto, and it is bad.
[615.00 --> 622.00]  But it's not necessarily as bad as most people are taking it because they're just looking at the picture, going, oh, that's horrible.
[622.00 --> 623.00]  I don't know.
[623.00 --> 628.00]  I mean, is this that typical sort of North American thing where we treat our own natural disasters like they're...
[628.00 --> 629.00]  That's the worst thing ever.
[629.00 --> 632.00]  ...like they're just devastating and then...
[632.00 --> 636.00]  Compared to stuff that's like happening in other parts of the world, it's like, uh, guys, really?
[636.00 --> 639.00]  Like all those sinkholes in South American.
[639.00 --> 640.00]  Yeah!
[640.00 --> 641.00]  Like that was a huge deal.
[641.00 --> 642.00]  That was bad.
[642.00 --> 643.00]  That's crazy!
[643.00 --> 645.00]  But it didn't get that much publicity ever.
[645.00 --> 646.00]  No!
[646.00 --> 647.00]  I barely even heard about it.
[647.00 --> 650.00]  I don't think I even heard about it, like, in the paper or anything.
[650.00 --> 651.00]  Honestly, nowadays...
[651.00 --> 652.00]  It's all internet.
[652.00 --> 655.00]  I get all my news from Reddit.
[655.00 --> 661.00]  Because if I don't get all my news from Reddit, if it's a local channel, I only hear about, like, oh, someone's dog ran away.
[661.00 --> 663.00]  I know!
[663.00 --> 666.00]  You know what was in the, uh, oh, this was the stupidest thing ever.
[666.00 --> 667.00]  You know what was in the local paper?
[667.00 --> 668.00]  In, uh, Suri?
[668.00 --> 669.00]  What?
[669.00 --> 670.00]  I don't...
[670.00 --> 671.00]  Did I show you this?
[671.00 --> 676.00]  They had, like, a send us your Minecraft essay thing.
[676.00 --> 683.00]  It was like this desperate attempt at, like, outreach to a younger audience.
[683.00 --> 685.00]  Where you're just like, wow!
[685.00 --> 689.00]  You guys are the biggest tryhards on the face of the earth.
[689.00 --> 695.00]  Getting Minecraft players to send in an essay, you're not... you got your target audience wrong, bro.
[695.00 --> 697.00]  To a newspaper!
[698.00 --> 703.00]  You've got the wrong audience, you've got the wrong decade, you've got the wrong...
[703.00 --> 704.00]  Everything.
[704.00 --> 705.00]  Everything.
[705.00 --> 706.00]  You got it wrong.
[706.00 --> 708.00]  And this is the problem with the newspaper.
[708.00 --> 711.00]  I attended a social media conference, uh, not that long ago.
[711.00 --> 713.00]  Uh, must have been...
[713.00 --> 718.00]  Well, okay, it was pre-Linus Media Group, so I guess it wasn't that not long ago.
[718.00 --> 719.00]  It's hard to keep track.
[719.00 --> 720.00]  Was that the one I was at?
[720.00 --> 721.00]  No.
[721.00 --> 722.00]  The YouTube conference?
[722.00 --> 723.00]  No.
[723.00 --> 724.00]  No, that one was stupid.
[724.00 --> 725.00]  That one was horrible.
[725.00 --> 726.00]  That one was stupid.
[726.00 --> 727.00]  No, this one was good.
[727.00 --> 728.00]  I was like, by Gary Vaynerchuk.
[728.00 --> 729.00]  Okay.
[729.00 --> 732.00]  So, there was, like, one of the few people left...
[732.00 --> 740.00]  I mean, the funny thing about newspaper is it's like, you kind of go, if only someone there knew what they were doing so they could save these traditional mediums, right?
[740.00 --> 744.00]  But then you kind of look at it and go, what competent person would still be there?
[744.00 --> 748.00]  Um, that's not fair.
[748.00 --> 750.00]  Anyone working in newspaper, I know there are still good people there.
[750.00 --> 752.00]  But this guy was really good.
[752.00 --> 759.00]  So, he was talking about how they have a club that ties social media together with the paper.
[759.00 --> 764.00]  So, you know how, you know, people love shoutouts on the stream, right?
[764.00 --> 765.00]  People...
[765.00 --> 772.00]  And even today, like, even with print being as irrelevant as it is, people love seeing their name or their article in print.
[772.00 --> 779.00]  So, what they did was they made, like, a Twitter group, like a club, that, um, shares, like, food experiences.
[779.00 --> 787.00]  And then what you could do is you could submit it to the paper and instead of trying to leverage the...
[787.00 --> 788.00]  Oh, wow.
[788.00 --> 789.00]  Nice check.
[789.00 --> 790.00]  You just flattened my guy.
[790.00 --> 791.00]  You flattened my guy right before that.
[791.00 --> 792.00]  Oh, I didn't do that on purpose.
[792.00 --> 793.00]  Oh.
[793.00 --> 802.00]  So, instead of using social media to try to drive the paper, they used the paper to drive their social media.
[802.00 --> 803.00]  That's smart.
[803.00 --> 804.00]  Which is where they're actually going to have the growth.
[804.00 --> 805.00]  Yeah.
[805.00 --> 808.00]  And I was like, oh, someone who actually gets it.
[808.00 --> 813.00]  Someone who isn't just going to let their entire business die.
[813.00 --> 814.00]  Uh-oh.
[814.00 --> 815.00]  How clever.
[815.00 --> 817.00]  And, uh, they need more of that.
[817.00 --> 818.00]  Boom!
[818.00 --> 819.00]  Security goal!
[819.00 --> 820.00]  Yarmu Jaeger!
[820.00 --> 822.00]  Assisted by Patrick Waugh!
[822.00 --> 825.00]  That was a sick runaway there.
[825.00 --> 831.00]  Uh, your guys were, you know, they were pinching kind of aggressively, trying to, you know, whatever strategy,
[831.00 --> 834.00]  semblance of strategy we can pretend exists in this particular game.
[834.00 --> 835.00]  What?!
[835.00 --> 837.00]  You just spit on me!
[837.00 --> 838.00]  Good!
[838.00 --> 839.00]  That's disgusting!
[839.00 --> 840.00]  Woo!
[840.00 --> 841.00]  Three times now!
[841.00 --> 842.00]  Three times!
[842.00 --> 846.00]  Okay, why don't we do one more of these before we switch to something else.
[846.00 --> 852.00]  By the way, I think the problem with Beavis and Butthead is there are a lot of game mechanics that we were not using.
[852.00 --> 855.00]  Oh, is it one of those games where you need to RTFM?
[855.00 --> 856.00]  Yeah.
[856.00 --> 858.00]  Uh, I think you're player one.
[858.00 --> 861.00]  I'm never player one.
[861.00 --> 862.00]  Here.
[862.00 --> 863.00]  I'm going to address that.
[863.00 --> 864.00]  Cool.
[864.00 --> 865.00]  There you go.
[865.00 --> 866.00]  Because it's weird looking at the jerseys too.
[866.00 --> 872.00]  Yeah, but I was watching, like I was using it to configure all this so that everything was running correctly,
[872.00 --> 874.00]  and so the demo loop started running.
[874.00 --> 879.00]  And like, they can like throw each other, and one can go on the other one's shoulders,
[879.00 --> 880.00]  and we can like hit stuff.
[880.00 --> 881.00]  Remember, because we did the throw each other thing.
[881.00 --> 882.00]  Yeah.
[882.00 --> 888.00]  So there's like all kinds of like crazy shaz that they can do that we were not doing.
[888.00 --> 890.00]  We were just trying to like walk and like hunt.
[890.00 --> 893.00]  And like, you know how the buttons just didn't even seem to really do anything?
[893.00 --> 895.00]  Like the one was like licking.
[895.00 --> 896.00]  I was like, what?
[896.00 --> 898.00]  You want some blueberries?
[898.00 --> 899.00]  Sure.
[899.00 --> 900.00]  Okay.
[900.00 --> 902.00]  Um, so I should pick my team.
[902.00 --> 903.00]  I'm team one now, right?
[903.00 --> 904.00]  Yeah.
[904.00 --> 905.00]  I'm going to be Vancouver.
[905.00 --> 906.00]  You can be an all-star team if you want.
[906.00 --> 907.00]  I don't care.
[907.00 --> 908.00]  No, that's cool.
[908.00 --> 909.00]  I'm going to steal some crackers though.
[909.00 --> 910.00]  Yep.
[910.00 --> 911.00]  I don't remember what you said about blueberries.
[911.00 --> 912.00]  It's good with hummus.
[912.00 --> 913.00]  Is Ottawa okay?
[913.00 --> 914.00]  No, Ottawa sucks balls.
[914.00 --> 915.00]  New York?
[915.00 --> 916.00]  New York, good.
[916.00 --> 917.00]  I don't know.
[917.00 --> 918.00]  I don't know.
[918.00 --> 919.00]  I don't know.
[919.00 --> 920.00]  I don't know.
[920.00 --> 921.00]  I don't know.
[921.00 --> 922.00]  I don't know.
[922.00 --> 923.00]  New York's good.
[923.00 --> 925.00]  Sure, let's do that.
[925.00 --> 927.00]  Okay, press start.
[927.00 --> 928.00]  I'm not...
[928.00 --> 929.00]  Oh, it works anyways?
[929.00 --> 931.00]  Oh yeah, New York's better than me.
[931.00 --> 932.00]  Lol.
[932.00 --> 937.00]  I'm not super convinced those metrics mean that much.
[937.00 --> 938.00]  Oh no, they do.
[938.00 --> 939.00]  They do?
[939.00 --> 940.00]  Okay.
[940.00 --> 942.00]  If you play it, but maybe not when it's like...
[942.00 --> 944.00]  Are those like direct variables?
[944.00 --> 945.00]  Hmm.
[945.00 --> 946.00]  Well, they're averages.
[946.00 --> 950.00]  And remember that the fact that we're playing line one against line one for the entire game
[950.00 --> 951.00]  skews it.
[951.00 --> 952.00]  Right.
[952.00 --> 958.00]  So a team like Pittsburgh that I don't think registers very well, their top line has like
[958.00 --> 961.00]  Yager and Lemieux at this point in time.
[961.00 --> 966.00]  So even if the rest of their team is total shite, they can still score a goal or two.
[966.00 --> 967.00]  Oh.
[967.00 --> 972.00]  This is because like these guys feel a lot faster than that all-star team I just think.
[972.00 --> 974.00]  Hmm, okay.
[974.00 --> 975.00]  Oh, oops.
[975.00 --> 976.00]  You know what we should do?
[976.00 --> 982.00]  Is we should actually fine tune the CRT to stretch the image like too much.
[982.00 --> 983.00]  Oh no!
[983.00 --> 985.00]  That was a good goal.
[985.00 --> 986.00]  Stretch the image...
[986.00 --> 987.00]  Oh, to like just...
[987.00 --> 988.00]  Yeah.
[988.00 --> 989.00]  That's not a bad idea.
[989.00 --> 990.00]  So we can actually play them full size.
[990.00 --> 993.00]  Guys, our gaming setup isn't really optimal this week.
[993.00 --> 995.00]  It's like way over there.
[995.00 --> 998.00]  And I think there's some more room for improvement there.
[998.00 --> 999.00]  Yeah.
[999.00 --> 1003.00]  Overall though, I think today was one of the smoothest streams we've had.
[1003.00 --> 1004.00]  Yep.
[1004.00 --> 1006.00]  I'm really happy.
[1006.00 --> 1010.00]  The start of comps was my fault and really bad.
[1010.00 --> 1012.00]  Oh yeah, what did you do?
[1012.00 --> 1013.00]  You broke the entire channel?
[1013.00 --> 1018.00]  I broke the entire channel because I forget that when you're an admin...
[1018.00 --> 1020.00]  Like to leave it...
[1020.00 --> 1022.00]  Okay, because you and me were getting spanned with notifications.
[1022.00 --> 1023.00]  Right.
[1023.00 --> 1024.00]  That was a problem.
[1024.00 --> 1027.00]  So I jumped on your laptop because yours was most important.
[1027.00 --> 1030.00]  Oh, wow!
[1030.00 --> 1031.00]  That was a pact!
[1031.00 --> 1033.00]  How did that not go in?
[1033.00 --> 1034.00]  A, I don't know.
[1034.00 --> 1036.00]  B, I passed and it went directly at my goalie.
[1036.00 --> 1038.00]  That totally looked like an own goal.
[1038.00 --> 1040.00]  Oh my goodness, that was sketchy.
[1042.00 --> 1043.00]  That was awesome.
[1043.00 --> 1046.00]  You should do more passes like that.
[1046.00 --> 1047.00]  Pass to your goalie.
[1047.00 --> 1048.00]  I know, right?
[1048.00 --> 1050.00]  Because that's a good strategy for gaming.
[1050.00 --> 1051.00]  Or like hockey gaming.
[1051.00 --> 1052.00]  That's a thing.
[1052.00 --> 1053.00]  This is hockey gaming.
[1053.00 --> 1054.00]  Boom!
[1054.00 --> 1055.00]  Aw.
[1055.00 --> 1056.00]  Yes!
[1056.00 --> 1057.00]  What a move!
[1057.00 --> 1058.00]  Trevor Linden!
[1058.00 --> 1059.00]  Aw.
[1059.00 --> 1060.00]  I think that's the clearest one ever.
[1060.00 --> 1062.00]  Assisted by Jeff Cortnall and Cliff Ronning.
[1062.00 --> 1064.00]  Have I ever told you Cliff Ronning is kind of a hero for me?
[1064.00 --> 1066.00]  Oh my God.
[1066.00 --> 1069.00]  Well, he's one of the only people my...
[1069.00 --> 1070.00]  Okay, I get it!
[1073.00 --> 1074.00]  Jeez.
[1075.00 --> 1076.00]  Whatever, man.
[1076.00 --> 1077.00]  Cliff Ronning's awesome.
[1077.00 --> 1080.00]  So is Theo Fleury, even though he's like a drug addict.
[1080.00 --> 1081.00]  Or was.
[1081.00 --> 1083.00]  So as long as they're short, they're okay in your books.
[1083.00 --> 1085.00]  As long as they're short and successful.
[1085.00 --> 1088.00]  You can find lots of short, unsuccessful people.
[1088.00 --> 1089.00]  Aw.
[1089.00 --> 1090.00]  Juicy rebound.
[1090.00 --> 1091.00]  Could not capitalize.
[1091.00 --> 1092.00]  Um.
[1092.00 --> 1093.00]  Want some blueberries?
[1093.00 --> 1094.00]  Yeah.
[1094.00 --> 1095.00]  Go for it.
[1095.00 --> 1096.00]  Just...
[1096.00 --> 1097.00]  You want me to just dump them on the couch?
[1097.00 --> 1098.00]  Some of them are mushy.
[1098.00 --> 1099.00]  I meant like...
[1099.00 --> 1100.00]  You want me to put them over there?
[1100.00 --> 1102.00]  Well then I'm gonna have to like touch you when I want them.
[1102.00 --> 1103.00]  Ew, I touched your leg.
[1103.00 --> 1104.00]  What?
[1104.00 --> 1105.00]  It was actually not that bad.
[1105.00 --> 1106.00]  And that was my wallet, or my phone.
[1106.00 --> 1107.00]  That was your phone?
[1107.00 --> 1108.00]  Oh, okay.
[1108.00 --> 1109.00]  That was my phone.
[1109.00 --> 1110.00]  That was my phone.
[1110.00 --> 1111.00]  That was my phone.
[1111.00 --> 1112.00]  That was my phone.
[1112.00 --> 1113.00]  That was my phone.
[1113.00 --> 1114.00]  That was my phone.
[1114.00 --> 1115.00]  That was my wallet.
[1115.00 --> 1116.00]  Here, let me try again.
[1116.00 --> 1117.00]  Oh, god.
[1117.00 --> 1119.00]  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.
[1119.00 --> 1126.00]  So, I promised we'd discuss this on the after party.
[1126.00 --> 1128.00]  Microsoft, killing Skype.
[1128.00 --> 1129.00]  Ugh.
[1129.00 --> 1130.00]  What are they doing?
[1130.00 --> 1131.00]  Everything wrong.
[1131.00 --> 1133.00]  Like, what are they doing?
[1133.00 --> 1137.00]  The crazy thing about it is like, Microsoft...
[1137.00 --> 1138.00]  Ugh.
[1138.00 --> 1140.00]  You know, MSN wasn't that...
[1140.00 --> 1142.00]  No one was using it, but I really think it was a good product.
[1142.00 --> 1143.00]  Oh, that was a good product.
[1143.00 --> 1144.00]  That was a good product.
[1144.00 --> 1148.00]  I don't understand why MSN has just been abandoned by the internet collectively.
[1148.00 --> 1149.00]  I mean...
[1149.00 --> 1153.00]  Is the problem that it's not integrated with Facebook?
[1153.00 --> 1154.00]  Is the problem that it's...
[1154.00 --> 1155.00]  It was...
[1155.00 --> 1157.00]  What really took it over was everyone was talking on Facebook now.
[1157.00 --> 1158.00]  Well, how did that go in?
[1158.00 --> 1159.00]  Bam, back-ender.
[1159.00 --> 1160.00]  Crap.
[1160.00 --> 1161.00]  Um...
[1161.00 --> 1162.00]  Everyone was talking on Facebook.
[1162.00 --> 1163.00]  Um...
[1163.00 --> 1164.00]  Mm...
[1164.00 --> 1165.00]  Um...
[1165.00 --> 1167.00]  It's like...
[1167.00 --> 1168.00]  Cause like...
[1168.00 --> 1170.00]  So is Skype gonna fix that?
[1170.00 --> 1172.00]  By killing MSN and moving to Skype?
[1172.00 --> 1173.00]  Like...
[1173.00 --> 1175.00]  How does that address anything?
[1175.00 --> 1177.00]  I... honestly, I don't think it does.
[1177.00 --> 1182.12]  given how terrible the text chat experience on Skype is compared to MSN.
[1182.12 --> 1192.00]  Like, great example, someone messages you on Skype. Oh no! Okay, I got this. Great
[1192.00 --> 1195.60]  example, someone messages you on Skype, you click on the notification in the
[1195.60 --> 1201.36]  bottom right, and then for whatever reason, instead of going straight to that
[1201.36 --> 1205.66]  person's chat window and letting you type immediately, you then have to click the
[1205.66 --> 1209.86]  notification, then click on the text box, then you get to type to them? That's
[1209.86 --> 1216.76]  ridiculous. That's like UI, like, like high school level crap there. That is a big
[1216.76 --> 1220.06]  problem. I was backtracking your guy completely around that corner slowing you
[1220.06 --> 1227.02]  down, the goalie still didn't come around. Wraparounds are nuts! Yeah, like, that's,
[1227.02 --> 1234.82]  yeah, like, first class of HCI ever. Exactly! And that's the kind of thing that kills me
[1234.82 --> 1238.72]  about this thing. It's like, the stuff that they're not doing is obvious. Speaking of
[1238.72 --> 1245.92]  things that are, okay, okay, never mind. No, I'm gonna talk about this later. Um, and I
[1245.92 --> 1251.92]  mean, the whole people being upset about, you know, Microsoft's private servers doing
[1251.92 --> 1263.02]  whatever, I mean. Whoa. That I don't feel like is that big of a deal right now. Like, or in general. Like, I actually don't care about that as much.
[1263.02 --> 1271.92]  The privacy thing? Yeah. Because there were some compelling reasons they did it, if I recall correctly. I read a list. I just, I don't really remember anymore. Um...
[1271.92 --> 1280.92]  I don't remember where I was going with that. Does that bother you? What? The fact that they changed it from...
[1280.92 --> 1289.92]  Yeah, I kind of expected that by now. Whatever, we'll change games soon. I like this game. Boom!
[1289.92 --> 1296.92]  Did you? They were wet when I pulled them.
[1296.92 --> 1302.92]  Sure, yeah, they're washed then. We both grew up in the country.
[1302.92 --> 1310.92]  Yeah, he, no, he asked me that the other day. I was like, does your, does your family's farm use pesticides? He's like, no. I'm like, he's like, well, would you eat blueberries?
[1310.92 --> 1320.92]  That was so open. If you picked them right off the bush? I'm like, I grew up on a farm, dude. Yeah, I've done that before. That's a lot. That's the way to eat blueberries. I used to do that like every day.
[1320.92 --> 1327.92]  Yeah, we had blueberry bushes in the backyard. I didn't have blueberry bushes, but I'd rollerblade down to where there was blackberry bushes and eat those.
[1327.92 --> 1336.92]  Covered in dust? Atmosphere and bugs? You know what? Oh, how did that go in? That was ridiculous. That was amazing! That was amazing!
[1336.92 --> 1349.92]  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on. Okay, I have to know. Okay, okay, what is this? Slow-mo replay? Don't you love the rudimentary controls back there?
[1349.92 --> 1355.92]  Okay, so there's an attempted check. First of all, how did Babich not have this? Second of all, what is this?
[1355.92 --> 1364.92]  Okay, so you were standing there. You were re- you- okay. You were ready. Here. That's how close the po- boom!
[1364.92 --> 1371.92]  Okay, hold on. You got a piece of it. Yeah, that's fine. Dive backwards after the puck's in the net. That makes perfect sense.
[1371.92 --> 1376.92]  At the same time, you scored one from behind your own blue line before. Okay, that's true.
[1376.92 --> 1380.92]  So... But I have higher expectations for McClane.
[1380.92 --> 1393.92]  I mean, do you care that everything's going through a Microsoft server now? Will you stop using Skype because of that? Or will you stop using Skype for, like, the UI terribleness?
[1393.92 --> 1403.92]  Ugh. I've started to move away because of that. Are you gonna keep using Skype? I don't want to.
[1403.92 --> 1412.92]  Oh, come on! Boom! That was sweet. That was sweet. That one was pretty sweet. Dang it. Um...
[1412.92 --> 1418.92]  Wow, high-scoring game. Yeah, seriously. I'm- I'm- I'm currently moving to stop using it.
[1418.92 --> 1426.92]  One of the reasons why, uh, that one article on whatever the heck it's called, Swedish Word Program, is in there is because I was interested in it.
[1426.92 --> 1430.92]  Now, I was going to back it. I didn't realize that they were gonna close- Yeah, they closed it.
[1430.92 --> 1438.92]  Like, what? I was gonna do it this weekend. I- Why? I thought there would be, like, a long time left to back it. Um...
[1439.92 --> 1444.92]  And I don't think I'm the only one that thought that. Maybe I didn't read it enough. I thought that was enough.
[1444.92 --> 1447.92]  Maybe I didn't read it enough or something. Whoa! No!
[1447.92 --> 1452.92]  That time Babich gets it. Oh my- Did you see that shot? Where was that going?
[1453.92 --> 1458.92]  But... I just... Now, back to the whole idea.
[1458.92 --> 1466.92]  I don't think I have anything to hide. Okay. But I might. I don't know all the laws. And... Right.
[1466.92 --> 1469.92]  Considering they can't count them all, no one does. Right.
[1469.92 --> 1473.92]  I might be doing something wrong that I have no idea is wrong. Yep.
[1474.92 --> 1480.92]  Like... I don't... I don't know. Okay, so... Um...
[1481.92 --> 1486.92]  Were you- I just- I just- I don't like people sniffing on all my stuff. It's my conversation.
[1486.92 --> 1490.92]  I had a private conversation with this person. It should be a private conversation with this person.
[1490.92 --> 1494.92]  Okay, what about Razer Comms? Because I don't think anyone even knows what the privacy...
[1494.92 --> 1498.92]  Sort of- Because it's all running through Razer servers. Is it any different?
[1498.92 --> 1500.92]  What voice chat client would you use then?
[1500.92 --> 1506.92]  I... Honestly, right now, the way I'm treating it, every single voice chat client is being listened in on.
[1506.92 --> 1508.92]  Because Razer Comms servers are in the States, are they not?
[1508.92 --> 1510.92]  I believe so. So Razer Comms doesn't have a choice.
[1510.92 --> 1514.92]  So, basically...
[1514.92 --> 1522.92]  If you're running a voice chat service, if you're talking to someone through voice, it's being listened to in some way.
[1522.92 --> 1524.92]  And just treat it that way. Yeah.
[1524.92 --> 1528.92]  So anything other than a letter...
[1528.92 --> 1530.92]  Is potentially not secure?
[1530.92 --> 1535.92]  Pretty much. As far as I've seen. Because NSA's tapped into lines. So it doesn't matter.
[1535.92 --> 1540.92]  And they've released a statement that says, go ahead, encrypt your data. We'll just save your encrypted data.
[1540.92 --> 1545.92]  And if we think you're- if we need to see it, we'll just break it when we need to see it.
[1545.92 --> 1549.92]  And by then, the encryption will probably be worse anyways.
[1549.92 --> 1556.92]  So like... I don't know. Even this new Heimelus or whatever it's called program, it's encrypted end to end.
[1556.92 --> 1558.92]  It's probably still gonna be locked.
[1558.92 --> 1563.92]  Right. By someone somewhere... and...
[1563.92 --> 1565.92]  Hmm.
[1567.92 --> 1569.92]  So like... So what? Do you give up on voice chat?
[1569.92 --> 1572.92]  Do you give up on communicating to people?
[1572.92 --> 1577.92]  And stuff like... Okay, that kid. We didn't get to get to this news article, but...
[1577.92 --> 1579.92]  The kid that got put in jail.
[1579.92 --> 1580.92]  Yeah.
[1580.92 --> 1582.92]  There's more than one, by the way.
[1582.92 --> 1583.92]  Yeah, I know. He's not the only one.
[1583.92 --> 1584.92]  He's not the only one.
[1584.92 --> 1589.92]  That's like a thing now, is like putting kids in jail for saying stuff that they never actually acted on.
[1589.92 --> 1592.92]  I mean, to me, that almost is starting to feel like Minority Report.
[1592.92 --> 1594.92]  Yep. And...
[1594.92 --> 1595.92]  Like pre-crime division.
[1595.92 --> 1600.92]  And like, dude, I've said stuff like that. Not as bad as he did. His was pretty bad.
[1600.92 --> 1606.92]  I know, and you gotta... I mean, you gotta... Okay, there's something to be said for having an ounce of friggin' common sense.
[1606.92 --> 1610.92]  And like, you know, treating the things you say to people like people are listening to them.
[1610.92 --> 1614.92]  At the same time though, I've been like, dude, I'm gonna kill you.
[1615.92 --> 1618.92]  I've probably told you... No, I don't think I've ever threatened to kill you.
[1618.92 --> 1619.92]  Yes, you have.
[1619.92 --> 1620.92]  Have I?
[1620.92 --> 1621.92]  I've never thought it was serious.
[1621.92 --> 1622.92]  Right.
[1622.92 --> 1623.92]  But you have.
[1623.92 --> 1624.92]  Oh.
[1624.92 --> 1626.92]  Like, I never at once thought it was serious.
[1626.92 --> 1627.92]  Well, I threatened to fire you a lot.
[1627.92 --> 1628.92]  Yeah.
[1628.92 --> 1631.92]  But like, I don't know. Everyone screws around.
[1631.92 --> 1632.92]  Like...
[1632.92 --> 1635.92]  Yeah, everyone says, I could've killed that guy for... whatever.
[1635.92 --> 1639.92]  Yeah, I'm like, man, I could kill that guy. No, you're not actually gonna kill that person.
[1639.92 --> 1641.92]  Yeah, killing people is like that.
[1641.92 --> 1642.92]  Kind of a big deal.
[1642.92 --> 1643.92]  Not supported by the WAN show.
[1643.92 --> 1644.92]  No.
[1644.92 --> 1645.92]  But like...
[1645.92 --> 1646.92]  No!
[1646.92 --> 1647.92]  Oh!
[1647.92 --> 1648.92]  I don't know.
[1648.92 --> 1654.92]  I'm sure the audience wanted that to go in because they're apparently sick of hockey.
[1654.92 --> 1656.92]  Whatever, hockey's awesome.
[1656.92 --> 1657.92]  Oh my god.
[1657.92 --> 1658.92]  Welcome to Canada.
[1658.92 --> 1660.92]  This is what we stream in Canada.
[1660.92 --> 1663.92]  Old, crappy hockey games.
[1663.92 --> 1665.92]  No, this is it, this is it, this is it.
[1665.92 --> 1666.92]  No, no, no.
[1666.92 --> 1667.92]  Boom!
[1667.92 --> 1668.92]  Yes!
[1668.92 --> 1670.92]  See, that's the problem with hockey.
[1670.92 --> 1671.92]  Oh, my God.
[1671.92 --> 1675.92]  See, that's the problem with Cliff Ronning is he can't body check for crap.
[1675.92 --> 1676.92]  Because he's only 5'6".
[1676.92 --> 1679.92]  Have I ever told you that Cliff Ronning is kind of a personal hero for me?
[1679.92 --> 1681.92]  There he goes, there he goes!
[1681.92 --> 1682.92]  Go Cliff, go Cliff!
[1682.92 --> 1683.92]  Shoot, shoot Cliff!
[1683.92 --> 1685.92]  No, he hit the post!
[1685.92 --> 1689.92]  Cliff, you are losing hero status here!
[1689.92 --> 1691.92]  Boom, boom, no!
[1691.92 --> 1693.92]  Go, go, go, go!
[1693.92 --> 1694.92]  Oh!
[1694.92 --> 1695.92]  Got icing.
[1695.92 --> 1696.92]  Bam!
[1696.92 --> 1698.92]  Needs more hummus.
[1698.92 --> 1699.92]  Good, eh?
[1699.92 --> 1700.92]  Mm-hmm.
[1700.92 --> 1701.92]  Cliff, go!
[1701.92 --> 1702.92]  Ah!
[1702.92 --> 1703.92]  How's it back?
[1703.92 --> 1704.92]  Oh!
[1704.92 --> 1709.92]  How did we have 8 goals in 15 minutes of play and now...
[1709.92 --> 1710.92]  Oh!
[1710.92 --> 1711.92]  That would have been awesome.
[1711.92 --> 1713.92]  We're 8 minutes into overtime, we can't score a single goal.
[1713.92 --> 1714.92]  Like, this is, like, ridiculous.
[1714.92 --> 1715.92]  Alright, Gortnal!
[1715.92 --> 1716.92]  Do it!
[1716.92 --> 1717.92]  Do it!
[1717.92 --> 1718.92]  Oh, come on.
[1718.92 --> 1731.92]  I don't remember any of our other topics and I can't look away from the game for long enough to, uh...
[1731.92 --> 1732.92]  Um...
[1732.92 --> 1733.92]  What were we talking about?
[1733.92 --> 1735.92]  Right, so, like...
[1735.92 --> 1736.92]  Uh...
[1736.92 --> 1738.92]  I'm not gonna stop using voice chat.
[1738.92 --> 1741.92]  You have to use voice chat to be able to play modern games.
[1741.92 --> 1744.92]  But, it does worry me.
[1744.92 --> 1756.92]  Because, if someone in government gets pissed off and goes, target this guy, they can look back through hundreds of days of voice chat data from me.
[1756.92 --> 1758.92]  I guess that's another thing.
[1758.92 --> 1760.92]  Is, like, the...
[1760.92 --> 1761.92]  How...
[1761.92 --> 1763.92]  The longevity of these logs.
[1763.92 --> 1764.92]  I mean, this is unprecedented.
[1764.92 --> 1767.92]  They're making massive zettabyte servers.
[1767.92 --> 1770.92]  This is, like, not, like, weird conspiracy theory stuff.
[1770.92 --> 1772.92]  They publicly said this.
[1772.92 --> 1773.92]  So, like...
[1773.92 --> 1774.92]  So, I mean...
[1774.92 --> 1775.92]  They're gonna have it.
[1775.92 --> 1777.92]  And they're gonna have it for a long time.
[1777.92 --> 1779.92]  I mean, at some point in time...
[1779.92 --> 1783.92]  You know, like, the only archive of a communication...
[1783.92 --> 1784.92]  Was...
[1784.92 --> 1789.92]  You know, some physical copy of it that could actually be destroyed.
[1789.92 --> 1791.92]  Not so anymore.
[1791.92 --> 1792.92]  Yep.
[1794.92 --> 1795.92]  Interesting.
[1795.92 --> 1798.92]  It's kind of insane.
[1800.92 --> 1801.92]  High game.
[1802.92 --> 1804.92]  How unsatisfying is that?
[1804.92 --> 1807.92]  This is weird.
[1807.92 --> 1810.92]  Twitch TV, just like, the page will not load for me.
[1810.92 --> 1812.92]  I can't get the Twitch chat going.
[1812.92 --> 1814.92]  You wanna, uh...
[1814.92 --> 1816.92]  Do you wanna dust off a new game for us?
[1816.92 --> 1817.92]  Uh...
[1817.92 --> 1819.92]  I've never done it.
[1819.92 --> 1820.92]  Let's see.
[1820.92 --> 1821.92]  Here.
[1821.92 --> 1822.92]  I'll just, uh...
[1822.92 --> 1824.92]  I'll go here for now.
[1824.92 --> 1825.92]  Hello, everyone!
[1825.92 --> 1826.92]  Okay, cool.
[1826.92 --> 1827.92]  We have to dust off the game.
[1827.92 --> 1828.92]  I mean, that's what...
[1828.92 --> 1829.92]  Oh, it's up there.
[1829.92 --> 1831.92]  There we go.
[1831.92 --> 1832.92]  And then alt-tab.
[1832.92 --> 1834.92]  And then...
[1834.92 --> 1835.92]  You can see folders.
[1835.92 --> 1837.92]  I mean, uh, you can see the...
[1837.92 --> 1839.92]  This is just our database list of the games we have.
[1839.92 --> 1840.92]  Yeah.
[1840.92 --> 1841.92]  And it tells us what shelf it's on.
[1841.92 --> 1843.92]  It tells us where to go and find the game.
[1843.92 --> 1844.92]  Yeah.
[1846.92 --> 1848.92]  It's important for us to say that.
[1848.92 --> 1855.92]  Because we're communicating on Twitch.tv, and we have no idea if Twitch.tv is like...
[1855.92 --> 1856.92]  You know...
[1856.92 --> 1858.92]  Whatever they're doing.
[1858.92 --> 1862.92]  They have to, like, talk about what we're talking about.
[1862.92 --> 1864.92]  I still can't.
[1864.92 --> 1865.92]  Hm?
[1865.92 --> 1866.92]  Oh, that's weird.
[1866.92 --> 1868.92]  Let me see.
[1868.92 --> 1869.92]  Oh.
[1869.92 --> 1870.92]  No mouse.
[1870.92 --> 1872.92]  Is it, like, turned off or something?
[1872.92 --> 1873.92]  I know there's a hotkey for it.
[1873.92 --> 1874.92]  Hm.
[1874.92 --> 1875.92]  My documents.
[1875.92 --> 1876.92]  Okay.
[1876.92 --> 1877.92]  Well, um...
[1877.92 --> 1878.92]  That's...
[1878.92 --> 1879.92]  That's interesting.
[1879.92 --> 1880.92]  Is this...
[1880.92 --> 1881.92]  No?
[1881.92 --> 1882.92]  What is this?
[1882.92 --> 1883.92]  Hm.
[1883.92 --> 1884.92]  Hm.
[1884.92 --> 1885.92]  Hey seben.
[1885.92 --> 1889.92]  Dr Whether is, will that help us in a 행복ite window?
[1889.92 --> 1890.92]  Yeah whore.
[1890.92 --> 1891.92]  That's, is it also useful.
[1891.92 --> 1892.92]  People who have done mort Barbie maps.
[1892.92 --> 1893.92]  Mm hmm.
[1893.92 --> 1894.92]  So you know, yes.
[1894.92 --> 1895.92]  Maybe, just manage with Ikoлад.
[1895.92 --> 1896.92]  You c pourtant.
[1896.92 --> 1897.92]  Meaning you canнул it out.
[1897.92 --> 1898.92]  That's if there is no idea what to do.
[1898.92 --> 1899.92]  I will tell you right.
[1899.92 --> 1900.92]  No.
[1900.92 --> 1901.92]  What?
[1901.92 --> 1902.92]  Let me know.
[1902.92 --> 1903.92]  This has been interesting over the years.
[1903.92 --> 1904.92]  What if I recall?
[1904.92 --> 1905.92]  Father Only has a location where there's notif ?
[1905.92 --> 1906.92]  That's interesting.
[1906.92 --> 1907.92]  Is this?
[1907.92 --> 1908.92]  No?
[1908.92 --> 1909.92]  What the hell?
[1909.92 --> 1911.92]  It actually feels cold there.
[1911.92 --> 1912.92]  The hell?
[1912.92 --> 1913.92]  Did I get what go again?
[1913.92 --> 1916.24]  No, it was just...
[1916.24 --> 1917.42]  Xplit was lagging out.
[1917.80 --> 1919.28]  Yeah, Xplit was lagging out.
[1919.56 --> 1920.76]  Well, no, Xplit's still working.
[1920.84 --> 1921.88]  They can see Xplit's working.
[1922.14 --> 1923.80]  How are we going to cover for this?
[1923.92 --> 1924.10]  Quick!
[1924.18 --> 1925.84]  We had Xplit running on this computer,
[1925.92 --> 1926.74]  which is a different computer,
[1926.80 --> 1927.42]  earlier in the day,
[1927.46 --> 1928.32]  and Xplit's lagging out.
[1929.52 --> 1929.90]  Yes.
[1931.82 --> 1932.90]  Alright, what games should we play?
[1935.52 --> 1937.54]  So many of these I don't recognize.
[1938.66 --> 1940.28]  100 billion games.
[1940.28 --> 1944.44]  There was civilization for SNES, you know.
[1945.10 --> 1945.68]  That's epic.
[1945.90 --> 1946.50]  Isn't that crazy?
[1946.96 --> 1947.72]  There's Clue.
[1948.66 --> 1951.10]  I don't even know if that would support two-player, though.
[1951.34 --> 1952.12]  Hey, Twitch chat,
[1952.50 --> 1954.74]  what game, if we have it, should we play?
[1954.90 --> 1955.86]  Yeah, if we have it.
[1955.92 --> 1957.30]  There's no guarantees that we have it.
[1957.88 --> 1958.88]  And this is driving me crazy.
[1958.96 --> 1959.58]  I'm going to have to, like,
[1959.62 --> 1960.80]  reboot my computer or something,
[1960.90 --> 1963.40]  because Twitch chat is not working for me.
[1963.88 --> 1965.28]  I'm watching the stream.
[1966.36 --> 1967.28]  Earthbound's an RPG.
[1967.56 --> 1968.66]  We're not playing Earthbound.
[1968.68 --> 1969.46]  I love Earthbound.
[1969.46 --> 1970.96]  I'm not playing Earthbound.
[1971.88 --> 1973.36]  Right, but I do love Earthbound.
[1974.20 --> 1975.26]  You can love it all you want,
[1975.32 --> 1976.18]  as long as I can watch.
[1979.02 --> 1979.96]  I mean, wait.
[1980.64 --> 1981.48]  What are we talking about?
[1984.34 --> 1985.54]  Someone asks for Bomberman?
[1986.04 --> 1987.70]  Goof Troop is actually kind of an awesome game.
[1988.20 --> 1989.02]  Never played it, let's do it.
[1989.16 --> 1990.04]  Alright, let's do Goof Troop.
[1991.26 --> 1992.18]  I'll go get it.
[1992.86 --> 1993.22]  Okay.
[1993.82 --> 1994.14]  Okay.
[1994.14 --> 1994.24]  Okay.
[1996.74 --> 1998.14]  Goof, goof, goof, goof, goof, goof, goof.
[1998.14 --> 1998.60]  Goof, goof, goof.
[1998.60 --> 1998.64]  Goof, goof, goof, goof.
[1999.46 --> 2002.62]  I think my back's still visible.
[2004.84 --> 2005.94]  It's kind of more my butt.
[2009.00 --> 2009.40]  Okay.
[2009.96 --> 2013.62]  Uh, uh, you have to blow it off.
[2014.30 --> 2014.60]  Okay.
[2014.60 --> 2014.68]  Okay.
[2014.68 --> 2021.52]  Oh, that would have been bad.
[2021.66 --> 2022.88]  Please don't drop the hummus.
[2028.62 --> 2029.60]  Okay, so hold on.
[2031.66 --> 2032.30]  There it is.
[2032.68 --> 2033.62]  Donkey Kong Co-op.
[2033.80 --> 2034.48]  It had Co-op.
[2034.48 --> 2037.20]  Oh, Donkey Kong Co-op was kind of awesome, actually.
[2037.54 --> 2038.88]  We will have to do that at some point.
[2038.92 --> 2039.68]  Was that for SNES?
[2039.90 --> 2040.34]  You bet.
[2041.16 --> 2042.34]  I didn't think it was for SNES.
[2042.40 --> 2043.06]  You betcha.
[2043.94 --> 2044.60]  Awesome game.
[2044.82 --> 2045.60]  Love that game.
[2045.60 --> 2048.66]  All right, Goof Troop time.
[2048.66 --> 2048.70]  All right.
[2048.76 --> 2048.78]  Goof Troop time.
[2050.48 --> 2055.14]  I haven't played this game in years, so I actually have no idea how it works anymore.
[2055.24 --> 2056.46]  I just totally don't remember it all.
[2059.32 --> 2059.88]  Capcom, though.
[2060.14 --> 2061.02]  So it couldn't be that bad.
[2062.92 --> 2063.62]  Here we go.
[2064.08 --> 2065.14]  Password for stages, probably.
[2066.10 --> 2068.16]  Yeah, we were meaning to talk about this for a while.
[2068.22 --> 2068.94]  Remember that?
[2069.18 --> 2069.36]  Yeah.
[2069.92 --> 2070.82]  That was awesome.
[2071.08 --> 2071.52]  It was epic.
[2071.64 --> 2072.34]  I actually liked it.
[2072.56 --> 2073.28]  It makes sense.
[2073.42 --> 2074.56]  It makes a ton of sense, actually.
[2075.16 --> 2076.34]  Well, no.
[2076.90 --> 2077.60]  No, it does.
[2077.94 --> 2079.18]  Because it doesn't take that much.
[2079.30 --> 2079.58]  See it?
[2079.70 --> 2080.04]  Night Diesel.
[2080.16 --> 2081.76]  It doesn't take that much to put that in the game.
[2082.32 --> 2084.30]  And instead of having save files and crap.
[2085.34 --> 2089.54]  Yeah, but save files can actually contain, like, information.
[2090.14 --> 2093.14]  Like, items that you have, or...
[2093.14 --> 2094.70]  What if there wasn't items and stuff in the game?
[2096.10 --> 2096.54]  Okay.
[2097.22 --> 2097.82]  How about this?
[2099.88 --> 2103.10]  Name, like, a legendary awesome game that has no items.
[2111.34 --> 2112.14]  And yes...
[2112.14 --> 2113.54]  Most of them have some form of item.
[2113.66 --> 2115.00]  There are some out there.
[2115.32 --> 2115.54]  Yeah.
[2115.98 --> 2116.94]  But, I mean...
[2116.94 --> 2121.94]  Even if you were to say, okay, um...
[2121.94 --> 2123.46]  Super Mario World doesn't have items.
[2124.32 --> 2127.14]  I would counter and I would say, but Super Mario World 3 does.
[2127.36 --> 2128.40]  Or Super Mario 3 does.
[2130.42 --> 2134.78]  And they can make a big difference later in the game in terms of moving through the game more quickly.
[2136.98 --> 2137.42]  So...
[2137.42 --> 2145.76]  But having one file sit there containing your items and then passwords still saves away more space.
[2146.18 --> 2147.22]  Even if they did it that way.
[2147.26 --> 2147.96]  I don't think anyone ever...
[2147.96 --> 2149.80]  I should probably be the young kid.
[2149.98 --> 2150.34]  What's his name?
[2150.40 --> 2150.98]  Max or something?
[2150.98 --> 2153.32]  I don't remember his name.
[2156.40 --> 2157.10]  But I'm short.
[2158.30 --> 2161.54]  I mean, it's certainly a better system than, uh...
[2161.54 --> 2164.94]  Mild Copy of TIE Fighter was awesome because I didn't know the...
[2164.94 --> 2167.94]  I didn't know the actual...
[2167.94 --> 2168.40]  Like, okay.
[2169.12 --> 2171.82]  I don't know if you guys watching are gonna remember this, but...
[2171.82 --> 2176.48]  Games used to have, like, manuals that had codes on each page.
[2177.10 --> 2180.54]  And the only way to launch the game was to prove you had the manual.
[2180.54 --> 2186.24]  By writing in the code that, uh...
[2186.24 --> 2189.50]  That corresponded to the page that it asked you to give a code for.
[2190.16 --> 2195.32]  So, my computer is playing back something about Lumosity, which is annoying.
[2195.52 --> 2196.76]  Did you start Lumosity for you?
[2197.10 --> 2198.94]  I started Lumosity for me, for sure.
[2199.70 --> 2201.20]  Twitch chat's just, like, broken for me.
[2201.24 --> 2201.82]  This is ridiculous.
[2202.44 --> 2202.84]  Anyway.
[2203.42 --> 2204.54]  Um...
[2204.54 --> 2206.54]  So, my copy of TIE Fighter...
[2207.14 --> 2209.96]  I only knew one of the codes and I lost my manual.
[2210.54 --> 2214.54]  So, I had no way to launch the game other than to just...
[2215.32 --> 2220.32]  Close and open the game enough times that eventually it would be right.
[2222.00 --> 2222.20]  Alright.
[2222.34 --> 2225.66]  Keelhaul Pete, de dreaded Pirate King, has returned.
[2226.14 --> 2227.46]  What am I doing here?
[2228.10 --> 2229.18]  You're picking things up.
[2229.26 --> 2229.54]  I can...
[2230.14 --> 2230.54]  But there's nothing...
[2231.26 --> 2232.48]  We're raising the roof.
[2232.80 --> 2233.26]  Hey-o!
[2234.84 --> 2235.66]  Okay, let's go.
[2236.72 --> 2237.80]  Okay, we can't go in the water.
[2238.84 --> 2239.98]  I'm gonna just walk around with this.
[2239.98 --> 2240.00]  Let's go this way.
[2240.00 --> 2240.70]  Because it's awesome.
[2241.02 --> 2241.20]  Oh.
[2241.34 --> 2242.06]  I'm getting cherries.
[2242.44 --> 2243.30]  I don't know what they do.
[2243.62 --> 2244.18]  Oh, they're life.
[2244.28 --> 2244.52]  Ha-ha.
[2245.44 --> 2246.18]  Do you want me to get this one?
[2246.18 --> 2246.82]  No, no, no, no!
[2246.88 --> 2247.40]  I want the hookshot!
[2247.78 --> 2248.28]  How do we...
[2248.28 --> 2248.78]  Oh!
[2250.28 --> 2250.90]  Okay, good work.
[2252.06 --> 2253.10]  You know...
[2253.10 --> 2253.86]  Spoonerville?
[2254.10 --> 2254.38]  Really?
[2255.88 --> 2256.56]  Spoonerville Island.
[2257.28 --> 2257.50]  Woo!
[2258.16 --> 2259.64]  So, is it a vill or an island?
[2260.00 --> 2260.90]  Or is it a spoon?
[2261.82 --> 2262.00]  Er.
[2262.00 --> 2263.66]  Used to be a safe place before.
[2263.74 --> 2266.54]  Old Keel Hall Pete got out of dat whale.
[2267.54 --> 2268.84]  I mean, he doesn't...
[2269.78 --> 2271.06]  What ethnicity are these people?
[2272.32 --> 2273.42]  How do I shoot my thing?
[2274.56 --> 2275.56]  I don't know, but I'll get the bell.
[2276.56 --> 2277.82]  The bell's probably pretty good.
[2279.08 --> 2279.68]  Um...
[2279.68 --> 2279.88]  Oh!
[2280.02 --> 2280.50]  There you go.
[2280.64 --> 2280.78]  Oh!
[2280.78 --> 2282.72]  I got a nut.
[2283.92 --> 2284.12]  Oh!
[2284.18 --> 2284.38]  Pfft!
[2285.34 --> 2285.66]  Sorry!
[2286.04 --> 2287.72]  I didn't even know I could hit you!
[2288.32 --> 2289.34]  And then he hit me.
[2290.04 --> 2290.70]  I'm sorry.
[2290.84 --> 2291.22]  That was...
[2291.22 --> 2292.20]  That was totally...
[2292.20 --> 2293.80]  That's kind of crazy that you can hit me, actually.
[2294.08 --> 2295.36]  That was totally my bad.
[2295.66 --> 2296.66]  Oh, these are way better.
[2296.78 --> 2298.24]  Oh, I think that's just a stun lock.
[2298.64 --> 2298.86]  Yeah.
[2299.04 --> 2299.72]  Yeah, you have to...
[2299.72 --> 2300.74]  You have to pop them one with this.
[2300.78 --> 2301.26]  Hold on, hold on.
[2301.28 --> 2301.86]  Can we move this thing?
[2303.28 --> 2304.24]  Oh, we can kick them.
[2305.34 --> 2306.26]  Probably not both together.
[2306.40 --> 2306.66]  Oh, okay.
[2306.78 --> 2307.36]  Yeah, that hurt.
[2307.72 --> 2308.00]  Apparently.
[2308.22 --> 2308.94]  It's broken now.
[2309.74 --> 2310.04]  Okay.
[2310.04 --> 2311.16]  I wonder what we're supposed to do with those.
[2311.28 --> 2312.02]  Can you pick up a snake?
[2312.68 --> 2313.00]  Whoa!
[2313.46 --> 2313.78]  Nope.
[2313.98 --> 2314.28]  Okay.
[2314.52 --> 2315.10]  Did I just die?
[2315.12 --> 2316.16]  I get my own hookshot now, though.
[2317.36 --> 2318.36]  And another bell.
[2318.60 --> 2321.14]  Oh, you can only carry one item at a time.
[2321.92 --> 2322.82]  So what does the bell do?
[2323.04 --> 2323.50]  Oh, wow.
[2324.52 --> 2325.62]  Oh, hookshot kills.
[2325.84 --> 2327.98]  Oh, I think the bell calls them over to me.
[2328.76 --> 2329.12]  Here.
[2329.36 --> 2330.16]  Can I attract them?
[2331.08 --> 2332.62]  That is the stupidest thing ever.
[2332.74 --> 2333.36]  I'm gonna go...
[2333.36 --> 2333.86]  Yeah, go hookshot.
[2334.52 --> 2336.46]  But I don't think we can kill them with the hookshot.
[2337.20 --> 2337.56]  Maybe.
[2337.74 --> 2338.38]  Do you have to kill...
[2338.38 --> 2338.54]  Oh.
[2338.90 --> 2339.16]  Yep.
[2339.16 --> 2340.70]  Oh, did that get you too?
[2340.98 --> 2341.92]  Yep, that's...
[2341.92 --> 2343.18]  Did I just die?
[2344.22 --> 2345.02]  No way.
[2345.58 --> 2346.36]  Okay, bring him over here.
[2346.42 --> 2346.86]  Bring him over here.
[2346.88 --> 2347.18]  I got him.
[2347.20 --> 2347.50]  I got him.
[2348.46 --> 2349.32]  Okay, don't stand there.
[2349.46 --> 2349.96]  There we go.
[2350.26 --> 2350.58]  Boom.
[2350.92 --> 2352.26]  All right, let's go to the right or up?
[2353.26 --> 2353.82]  Let's go right.
[2353.98 --> 2354.40]  We're right here.
[2354.52 --> 2354.68]  Bye.
[2357.48 --> 2358.38]  Okay, so...
[2358.38 --> 2358.90]  Okay.
[2358.90 --> 2359.12]  Okay.
[2360.58 --> 2361.40]  Oh, wow.
[2361.54 --> 2363.26]  I'm almost completely dead already.
[2363.26 --> 2366.52]  The saddest part is I've played this game before.
[2366.64 --> 2367.76]  Like, what's the excuse?
[2370.76 --> 2372.26]  Okay, there's pots over there.
[2372.32 --> 2372.90]  Can we get up here?
[2373.08 --> 2373.88]  Oh, there's ladder.
[2373.96 --> 2374.52]  Yeah, we can get up.
[2374.60 --> 2375.48]  There's steps or something.
[2375.62 --> 2376.14]  Get it up.
[2376.30 --> 2377.90]  Oh, you can push them into the water.
[2379.02 --> 2379.96]  Let's go see Pirate Pete.
[2379.96 --> 2380.54]  Oh, cool.
[2382.80 --> 2383.48]  Pirate Pete.
[2383.72 --> 2384.38]  What's this guy?
[2384.38 --> 2386.26]  Oh, can you take care of him?
[2386.44 --> 2387.82]  No, I think you're supposed to talk to him.
[2387.90 --> 2388.00]  Hey.
[2390.20 --> 2392.12]  Oh, I had to be slightly closer.
[2393.02 --> 2394.76]  You need a bridge to make it across here.
[2395.74 --> 2396.28]  Thank you.
[2396.94 --> 2398.82]  There looks like there's a bridge on the other side,
[2398.92 --> 2400.28]  so I guess...
[2400.28 --> 2400.98]  Go up.
[2402.16 --> 2402.30]  Yeah.
[2402.50 --> 2402.80]  Oh, I...
[2402.80 --> 2404.30]  Oh, really?
[2404.44 --> 2405.12]  Oh, I got a cherry.
[2407.26 --> 2407.98]  There's another one.
[2408.10 --> 2410.12]  We can't go...
[2410.12 --> 2411.70]  Oh, a banana is full life.
[2412.60 --> 2413.62]  Because that makes sense.
[2414.38 --> 2415.66]  I don't think we can go back.
[2415.76 --> 2417.06]  No, we have to kill them first, see?
[2417.96 --> 2418.58]  They actually...
[2418.58 --> 2419.28]  Oh, wow.
[2419.38 --> 2421.88]  They're going to make you clear every area every time.
[2422.04 --> 2422.66]  Throw one in there.
[2423.36 --> 2423.90]  Get both of them.
[2424.28 --> 2424.58]  Boom, boom.
[2424.60 --> 2425.06]  There we go.
[2425.94 --> 2427.34]  All right, then we can take out the...
[2427.34 --> 2428.50]  Oh, we don't have to take out the snake.
[2428.56 --> 2428.94]  We can go.
[2430.80 --> 2431.16]  Julio.
[2431.64 --> 2432.50]  Are you faster than me?
[2432.84 --> 2433.32]  I don't know.
[2436.58 --> 2436.90]  Okay.
[2437.20 --> 2437.94]  We suck.
[2438.12 --> 2438.78]  Does this hit him?
[2439.22 --> 2440.00]  No, okay.
[2440.26 --> 2442.30]  I think we have to get those things onto all the stars.
[2443.08 --> 2443.46]  You see that?
[2443.46 --> 2443.78]  Oh.
[2444.38 --> 2445.32]  I think I screwed it up.
[2445.76 --> 2446.66]  Unless I hit a star.
[2446.86 --> 2447.32]  I did not.
[2447.82 --> 2447.98]  No.
[2448.26 --> 2449.10]  Okay, better go back.
[2450.06 --> 2451.84]  Or do we only have to do one for each gate?
[2453.28 --> 2453.56]  Yep.
[2453.70 --> 2453.98]  Sweet.
[2454.24 --> 2456.26]  I think it's to the right that we have to go, but...
[2456.26 --> 2456.56]  What else?
[2456.74 --> 2459.72]  I think your face is to the right of where we have to go.
[2461.68 --> 2462.46]  I got this.
[2463.28 --> 2463.52]  Boom.
[2463.66 --> 2464.74]  I'm just throwing him over the fence.
[2466.18 --> 2467.52]  Oh, can you just hit him with the thing?
[2467.60 --> 2468.22]  I want the jewel.
[2470.16 --> 2470.88]  Do you need a cherry?
[2471.00 --> 2471.46]  Go get a cherry.
[2471.46 --> 2471.96]  Okay.
[2474.06 --> 2475.10]  How does this even work?
[2475.14 --> 2475.34]  Hold on.
[2475.40 --> 2475.64]  Hold on.
[2475.64 --> 2475.82]  Hold on.
[2476.22 --> 2476.70]  Don't do it.
[2476.74 --> 2477.44]  Don't do it.
[2477.82 --> 2478.38]  Okay, now.
[2480.38 --> 2481.06]  Get the jewel.
[2482.50 --> 2482.90]  Whoa.
[2483.04 --> 2483.96]  That's a free life.
[2484.68 --> 2485.38]  Oh, that's cool.
[2486.04 --> 2487.04]  I should not have taken that.
[2487.04 --> 2489.54]  Don't understand how to go through the lock thing.
[2490.58 --> 2491.56]  What's under this?
[2493.40 --> 2494.52]  Oh, I kicked the thing.
[2496.14 --> 2496.62]  Kick it.
[2496.90 --> 2497.36]  There you go.
[2497.68 --> 2498.00]  Nothing.
[2499.52 --> 2500.38]  I don't get this.
[2500.60 --> 2501.98]  Maybe we unlock it somewhere else.
[2502.08 --> 2502.38]  Let's go.
[2502.84 --> 2503.38]  Oh, okay.
[2503.44 --> 2504.26]  Yeah, there's probably a key.
[2505.26 --> 2506.76]  So I didn't unlock it.
[2506.84 --> 2507.56]  Yeah, we need more blueberries.
[2509.22 --> 2510.68]  So it's been kind of a long week, eh?
[2511.90 --> 2512.30]  Yeah.
[2513.60 --> 2514.68]  What even all happened?
[2515.06 --> 2516.34]  I just knew it was crazy.
[2517.62 --> 2519.26]  I was really busy, but I'm like...
[2519.80 --> 2524.38]  Whenever it's insanely busy, I have a hard time remembering everything that we had to do.
[2525.66 --> 2526.06]  Yeah.
[2526.20 --> 2528.22]  Because I just switched things so fast.
[2529.74 --> 2530.92]  There's a shovel over here.
[2530.92 --> 2532.06]  Can you use a shovel over there?
[2532.06 --> 2533.34]  Hmm.
[2534.12 --> 2534.48]  Treasure.
[2534.84 --> 2535.38]  Go for it.
[2537.94 --> 2538.64]  Okay, now what?
[2538.76 --> 2539.08]  Oh, here.
[2544.72 --> 2548.80]  Did I just throw that at you and you already had your arms up so you could carry it?
[2549.88 --> 2550.74]  Dig, dig, dig.
[2551.10 --> 2551.74]  I don't know.
[2553.32 --> 2554.40]  I've pressed everything.
[2555.32 --> 2555.56]  Really?
[2559.56 --> 2560.12]  Um...
[2560.12 --> 2561.52]  Do I have to talk to him?
[2562.92 --> 2563.36]  Nope.
[2564.68 --> 2565.64]  I don't think that's it.
[2568.46 --> 2570.28]  I can't wait to release our Intel video.
[2571.18 --> 2574.34]  Guys, for those of you watching who don't know about this already...
[2574.34 --> 2575.34]  Um...
[2575.34 --> 2575.84]  Pfff.
[2576.56 --> 2577.82]  Okay, sorry about that.
[2579.06 --> 2581.28]  I think you still have the shovel, but we have to clear this here.
[2581.28 --> 2581.74]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[2582.18 --> 2582.90]  Let me do it for you.
[2583.90 --> 2585.00]  Yeah, it works.
[2585.00 --> 2585.08]  Pff.
[2585.08 --> 2591.50]  Boom.
[2592.20 --> 2592.56]  Okay.
[2593.34 --> 2594.28]  Okay, can you dig now?
[2595.56 --> 2597.36]  I think I've been able to the whole time.
[2597.44 --> 2599.78]  It's just very specific where you have to stand.
[2600.78 --> 2602.72]  Oh, it's probably like nine of them.
[2603.22 --> 2603.92]  Maybe I have to move.
[2604.82 --> 2605.16]  Okay.
[2605.74 --> 2610.92]  Let me see if Twitch chat's working for me now, because I would love to do some Q&A or whatever
[2610.92 --> 2611.62]  on Twitch chat.
[2611.90 --> 2612.64]  I'm going to try a different browser.
[2612.74 --> 2613.22]  I'll try Firefox.
[2614.80 --> 2615.92]  Firefox never fail.
[2616.70 --> 2617.04]  Yeah.
[2617.04 --> 2618.20]  Except when it does fail.
[2618.26 --> 2618.78]  Except when it does.
[2620.18 --> 2621.80]  I still like it better than Chrome, though.
[2622.56 --> 2623.22]  I love Firefox.
[2624.28 --> 2628.38]  And Firefox is one of the few companies that's, like, actually rallying and actually, like,
[2628.52 --> 2631.88]  trying to get the whole net privacy thing going.
[2632.56 --> 2632.98]  Which is cool.
[2633.18 --> 2633.58]  I like that.
[2635.26 --> 2636.66]  Are they still a not-for-profit?
[2637.56 --> 2637.90]  Mm-hmm.
[2638.40 --> 2639.24]  We can go now.
[2640.18 --> 2640.54]  Seriously.
[2640.72 --> 2641.46]  I think we're done with that.
[2641.48 --> 2642.74]  Oh, I want my Slingshot thing.
[2643.20 --> 2643.84]  Oh, yeah, go.
[2643.84 --> 2643.90]  Go.
[2647.04 --> 2648.72]  Yeah, Mozilla Foundation's kind of cool.
[2649.44 --> 2649.98]  They're awesome.
[2651.20 --> 2651.94]  That's one of the reasons-
[2651.94 --> 2652.94]  Oh, do you want to try that?
[2653.30 --> 2653.80]  Oh, never mind.
[2654.24 --> 2654.70]  There it is.
[2654.78 --> 2655.26]  We need that.
[2656.68 --> 2657.40]  Oh, great.
[2657.48 --> 2661.24]  So I have to carry that instead of a hookshot all the way back.
[2661.86 --> 2662.78]  That makes sense.
[2666.86 --> 2667.80]  Well, this is fine.
[2671.74 --> 2672.56]  That works.
[2675.66 --> 2676.14]  All right.
[2677.04 --> 2680.72]  Oh, can you take care of these guys while I, like, go do other things?
[2682.38 --> 2683.10]  Oh, bananas.
[2683.22 --> 2683.54]  Who's low?
[2683.64 --> 2683.96]  I'm low.
[2686.28 --> 2687.92]  I thought three was our max.
[2688.78 --> 2690.40]  I think you can get more.
[2690.48 --> 2693.82]  Maybe the gem made it so we could have more.
[2695.14 --> 2695.50]  Okay.
[2695.68 --> 2696.38]  Logging in.
[2696.48 --> 2697.48]  Linus tech.
[2701.48 --> 2701.88]  Password.
[2701.88 --> 2706.74]  And go to the channel.
[2710.06 --> 2713.50]  Do you think Goof Troop is one of the options in the dashboard for, like, what we're streaming
[2713.50 --> 2713.86]  right now?
[2713.86 --> 2720.16]  Pop out.
[2720.16 --> 2720.20]  Pop out.
[2721.20 --> 2722.50]  Hey, there we go.
[2723.44 --> 2724.78]  Now I'm in the Twitch chat.
[2724.78 --> 2728.46]  Okay, I'm going to go half screen Twitch chat.
[2729.34 --> 2730.58]  Half screen Twitter.
[2730.58 --> 2739.26]  And I can use Chrome for Twitter because Chrome hasn't broken my tweeting-ness.
[2742.80 --> 2744.22]  That was cool having Paul on.
[2744.86 --> 2745.14]  Yeah.
[2745.30 --> 2746.14]  Paul's an awesome guy.
[2746.48 --> 2747.00]  I like Paul.
[2747.54 --> 2747.92]  Me too.
[2747.92 --> 2753.06]  I'm pretty excited to have, uh, to have Logan on next week, though.
[2753.58 --> 2754.52]  Yeah, that'll be cool.
[2754.80 --> 2757.18]  I told you that's, like, pretty much a done deal, right?
[2757.30 --> 2757.46]  Yeah.
[2759.62 --> 2760.38]  Hey, hey!
[2760.78 --> 2761.40]  I made a bridge.
[2761.96 --> 2764.28]  Do you know, like, what buttons do anything at this point?
[2764.56 --> 2765.04]  Not really.
[2765.42 --> 2766.16]  Oh, I made a bird.
[2767.16 --> 2768.04]  So French.
[2768.76 --> 2769.40]  Oh, bananas.
[2770.08 --> 2770.72]  All right, go for it.
[2770.82 --> 2771.10]  Okay.
[2772.18 --> 2774.90]  This thing is bananas.
[2774.90 --> 2775.78]  I love how bad.
[2775.78 --> 2777.06]  Hey, hey, hey, hey, yes.
[2777.06 --> 2779.58]  Like, potted plant just through the person.
[2780.00 --> 2781.16]  Oh, yeah, we can hit them into the water.
[2782.08 --> 2782.44]  Boom!
[2783.42 --> 2784.58]  Whoa, it takes two.
[2785.60 --> 2786.76]  There you go.
[2787.86 --> 2788.52]  There's fish.
[2788.62 --> 2789.26]  Can I hit the fish?
[2789.46 --> 2790.42]  I have no idea.
[2791.18 --> 2793.86]  I think you can hookshot these bananas and that thing, though.
[2794.38 --> 2794.86]  Go get them.
[2795.56 --> 2795.84]  What?
[2796.04 --> 2796.44]  Go get...
[2796.44 --> 2796.82]  Oh.
[2797.72 --> 2799.36]  I think only you can eat it, though.
[2800.18 --> 2801.50]  If you're the one who gets it.
[2804.30 --> 2805.50]  Games are so destructive.
[2805.50 --> 2807.78]  Why is everyone throwing plants all over the...
[2807.78 --> 2808.84]  Oh, it's a puzzle.
[2810.58 --> 2811.86]  All right.
[2814.62 --> 2815.52]  I don't get it.
[2816.08 --> 2818.02]  Okay, so this one...
[2820.02 --> 2820.80]  Yeah, okay.
[2820.98 --> 2821.38]  Then down.
[2824.44 --> 2824.88]  Okay.
[2824.88 --> 2827.66]  That one probably goes...
[2827.66 --> 2830.66]  Straight up...
[2830.66 --> 2831.28]  No.
[2831.44 --> 2831.92]  Okay, okay.
[2832.10 --> 2832.60]  I think I...
[2832.60 --> 2834.86]  This one goes over.
[2835.02 --> 2835.18]  Yep.
[2835.74 --> 2836.06]  Oh.
[2836.18 --> 2837.16]  No, I don't think so.
[2837.30 --> 2837.76]  No, it doesn't.
[2840.16 --> 2841.44]  No, I think we screwed up.
[2843.10 --> 2843.60]  Did we?
[2843.60 --> 2845.60]  Yeah, because there's only...
[2846.72 --> 2847.86]  X number of...
[2847.86 --> 2848.14]  Hold on.
[2848.18 --> 2848.92]  Yeah, I think we screwed up.
[2849.04 --> 2849.58]  I think we screwed up.
[2849.72 --> 2850.02]  Hold on.
[2850.18 --> 2850.80]  Yeah, let's try again.
[2851.46 --> 2852.88]  Okay, which one was that that you took?
[2854.22 --> 2855.64]  This one over here on the right, right?
[2855.72 --> 2856.18]  This one, yeah.
[2857.56 --> 2859.26]  I'm very sure that one went to the right spot.
[2861.44 --> 2862.82]  Because it went all the way over.
[2862.82 --> 2865.46]  I kicked it over here.
[2865.88 --> 2866.20]  Yeah.
[2867.00 --> 2867.52]  Up here.
[2867.72 --> 2868.90]  And then all the way over.
[2869.56 --> 2870.12]  Yeah, that...
[2870.12 --> 2871.38]  So I'm pretty sure that one went to the right spot.
[2871.46 --> 2872.30]  Must be it.
[2872.56 --> 2872.80]  Yeah.
[2874.26 --> 2875.82]  Is there a way to put...
[2875.82 --> 2876.48]  Oh, I...
[2876.48 --> 2877.06]  Oh, no.
[2880.68 --> 2883.74]  I feel dumb for not being able to solve this.
[2883.84 --> 2884.82]  If we kick this one...
[2886.26 --> 2891.34]  If we kick this one over, and then that one over, the second one will stack here.
[2891.34 --> 2894.18]  And then we can kick this one up this way.
[2894.34 --> 2894.84]  Yeah, that's it.
[2894.86 --> 2895.48]  And then back over.
[2895.88 --> 2896.12]  Yeah.
[2896.36 --> 2896.66]  Okay.
[2897.74 --> 2898.18]  Go.
[2900.04 --> 2900.56]  Boom.
[2902.60 --> 2903.50]  Then this.
[2907.52 --> 2908.00]  Then...
[2908.00 --> 2909.44]  Wait.
[2909.68 --> 2909.84]  Yeah.
[2911.84 --> 2912.28]  Yeah.
[2912.98 --> 2916.34]  Then I'm not actually sure what direction that goes yet.
[2916.64 --> 2918.34]  And it...
[2918.34 --> 2919.46]  Deleted the block.
[2919.76 --> 2920.68]  Deleted the block.
[2920.68 --> 2922.40]  But I don't know what way that one goes.
[2922.40 --> 2922.66]  Oh, no, no.
[2922.68 --> 2923.12]  That's easy.
[2924.46 --> 2924.64]  Yeah.
[2924.72 --> 2925.16]  Now...
[2925.16 --> 2925.30]  Yeah.
[2925.38 --> 2926.12]  It's done now.
[2927.34 --> 2927.74]  Okay.
[2928.22 --> 2929.64]  So this goes here.
[2929.80 --> 2930.94]  This goes here.
[2931.14 --> 2932.34]  This goes here.
[2933.20 --> 2934.68]  This goes...
[2934.68 --> 2935.00]  Yeah.
[2936.36 --> 2936.76]  Okay.
[2937.64 --> 2938.04]  Move.
[2939.00 --> 2940.02]  I guess I wasn't close enough.
[2940.40 --> 2942.18]  This one has to go this way.
[2942.42 --> 2942.62]  Yeah.
[2942.62 --> 2943.10]  That makes sense.
[2943.66 --> 2944.04]  Go ahead.
[2944.04 --> 2946.16]  Okay.
[2946.24 --> 2946.82]  Go finish that one.
[2946.86 --> 2947.30]  I'll do this one.
[2949.22 --> 2950.08]  We got this.
[2950.26 --> 2952.62]  We can solve puzzles that are designed for 10-year-olds.
[2953.56 --> 2954.54]  Like bosses.
[2956.80 --> 2957.72]  Go Goof Troop.
[2959.32 --> 2960.64]  This was actually a good show.
[2960.64 --> 2962.48]  I had to replace my slingshot with this.
[2962.62 --> 2963.12]  Pick it up.
[2963.64 --> 2964.08]  Mm-hmm.
[2969.46 --> 2970.44]  This is a pretty good game.
[2971.32 --> 2971.54]  Yeah.
[2971.58 --> 2972.18]  I'm enjoying it.
[2972.90 --> 2973.78]  Pwn all these noobs.
[2973.78 --> 2973.90]  Again.
[2976.24 --> 2976.80]  Sorry, noobs.
[2978.08 --> 2978.44]  Whoa.
[2978.98 --> 2980.58]  Well, I almost got...
[2980.58 --> 2981.82]  I got pwned there.
[2981.82 --> 2987.56]  Pwn this bridge, noob.
[2987.58 --> 2987.86]  Ugh!
[2988.48 --> 2989.60]  What the heck is this?
[2990.16 --> 2990.78]  Is that a bad guy?
[2992.26 --> 2992.66]  Yep.
[2996.24 --> 2997.12]  So random.
[2997.22 --> 2998.08]  That's one way to find out.
[3000.40 --> 3001.74]  What are goofs?
[3002.94 --> 3003.78]  Are they dogs?
[3004.52 --> 3005.28]  I don't know, man.
[3009.68 --> 3010.04]  Um.
[3011.82 --> 3014.52]  Hey, Twitch chat.
[3014.96 --> 3018.70]  One of the Flash sales games is God Mode.
[3019.36 --> 3021.56]  What is your guys' opinion on God Mode?
[3021.94 --> 3022.72]  Are you thinking of buying it?
[3023.08 --> 3023.72]  Never heard of it.
[3025.06 --> 3027.50]  I think I've heard of it, but I've never, like, seen it played.
[3027.80 --> 3028.40]  Sounds OP.
[3029.62 --> 3030.22]  Uh...
[3030.22 --> 3030.74]  Hey-oh!
[3032.26 --> 3032.66]  What?
[3033.02 --> 3033.74]  Left, remember?
[3033.86 --> 3034.40]  Because you got the key.
[3037.50 --> 3039.24]  I think my guy is faster than yours.
[3039.74 --> 3040.86]  Bad Game never played.
[3041.00 --> 3041.64]  Super boring.
[3041.82 --> 3043.24]  These are not...
[3043.24 --> 3044.84]  Not good reviews so far.
[3045.16 --> 3045.98]  Not that good.
[3046.38 --> 3046.80]  Oh, dear.
[3047.00 --> 3047.24]  Okay.
[3048.20 --> 3049.38]  Well, never mind, then.
[3050.56 --> 3050.98]  Oops.
[3052.22 --> 3053.62]  Everyone's asking about the Intel video.
[3053.98 --> 3054.54]  Oh, crap.
[3054.94 --> 3055.44]  Oh, yeah.
[3055.52 --> 3056.16]  Intel video.
[3056.70 --> 3059.02]  So, did we ever give, like, a teaser of that?
[3059.72 --> 3060.18]  I don't know.
[3061.02 --> 3061.76]  Should I do a teaser?
[3063.10 --> 3063.78]  Uh, sure.
[3063.98 --> 3065.38]  Seems like a legit thing to do, right?
[3065.38 --> 3065.46]  Okay.
[3065.46 --> 3065.94]  Okay.
[3068.52 --> 3068.92]  Okay.
[3068.98 --> 3069.46]  Maybe in a bit.
[3070.40 --> 3073.78]  Let's see if we can, like, uh, kill Pirate Pete first.
[3074.56 --> 3075.00]  I don't know.
[3075.04 --> 3076.32]  Games like this, do they have killing?
[3076.32 --> 3077.32]  No.
[3079.32 --> 3079.52]  No.
[3080.04 --> 3081.76]  They just have throwing out of the atmosphere.
[3082.90 --> 3083.26]  Yeah.
[3083.58 --> 3085.70]  Which is funny, because that'll definitely kill him.
[3089.16 --> 3089.78]  Left or up?
[3089.98 --> 3090.16]  Up.
[3090.34 --> 3090.82]  Let's go up.
[3090.88 --> 3091.62]  That was the locked one.
[3092.38 --> 3092.64]  Oh.
[3093.00 --> 3095.18]  Uh, do you need my purple peepin?
[3095.28 --> 3096.06]  Grab some of that stuff.
[3099.14 --> 3099.50]  Okay.
[3099.50 --> 3099.78]  Okay.
[3100.56 --> 3101.56]  Maybe we'll grab this.
[3101.74 --> 3102.12]  We'll have it.
[3102.44 --> 3103.06]  Boop, boop.
[3103.56 --> 3103.96]  Boop.
[3104.26 --> 3104.52]  Boop.
[3104.52 --> 3106.18]  Can you hit him enough times that he dies?
[3106.36 --> 3107.78]  Or gets knocked into the, wherever?
[3108.74 --> 3109.06]  Um.
[3109.08 --> 3110.44]  I don't have, here, give me.
[3111.12 --> 3112.58]  Okay, well, I can contain them here.
[3113.02 --> 3115.08]  Uh, but I can't get this block over there.
[3115.70 --> 3116.74]  Oh, what do you have to do?
[3116.88 --> 3120.98]  I think we have to call them until we can hit them with the block.
[3122.14 --> 3122.54]  Oh.
[3123.74 --> 3125.60]  So that's what the bells, okay, okay.
[3125.82 --> 3126.04]  Sure.
[3128.14 --> 3130.86]  I don't think we want to use this one, necessarily.
[3131.56 --> 3133.12]  I think we want to use this one.
[3133.72 --> 3134.16]  One of them.
[3134.16 --> 3136.10]  We can move that one that's in there.
[3136.16 --> 3137.44]  We can move it around quite a bit, actually.
[3138.22 --> 3138.90]  I see.
[3138.90 --> 3139.04]  Oh, crap.
[3140.10 --> 3141.26]  What have you done?
[3144.22 --> 3144.76]  Just that.
[3145.64 --> 3146.08]  Okay.
[3146.70 --> 3147.80]  I was trying to use the bell.
[3150.22 --> 3151.24]  Okay, so now what?
[3151.34 --> 3153.98]  I gotta get, well, get them below this and then kick it.
[3154.06 --> 3154.30]  Okay.
[3154.98 --> 3156.04]  Well, I can't stand there.
[3156.08 --> 3156.56]  Hold on, hold on.
[3157.06 --> 3158.26]  I think they're all coming for you.
[3158.26 --> 3159.30]  I know.
[3159.30 --> 3159.84]  I'm ringing the bell.
[3160.22 --> 3161.38]  I gotta get this guy.
[3163.32 --> 3164.40]  I can, I...
[3164.40 --> 3164.74]  Oh, dear.
[3165.48 --> 3165.62]  Here.
[3165.92 --> 3167.12]  Oh, what did...
[3167.12 --> 3168.32]  Oh, they...
[3168.32 --> 3169.96]  Okay, they smoke you pretty good.
[3170.06 --> 3170.30]  Yeah.
[3170.68 --> 3171.72]  They chase the bell.
[3172.28 --> 3172.98]  Okay, hit the bell.
[3173.54 --> 3173.88]  I...
[3173.88 --> 3178.16]  But I can't, like...
[3178.16 --> 3178.88]  You...
[3178.88 --> 3179.38]  No!
[3180.70 --> 3181.76]  What am I supposed to do?
[3182.64 --> 3185.40]  You have to come, like, keep them from actually hitting me.
[3185.66 --> 3186.98]  And I have to call them up here.
[3187.14 --> 3189.58]  Oh, because I was trying to, like, bop them over to you.
[3190.16 --> 3190.78]  Yeah, no.
[3191.82 --> 3192.58]  Okay, well, here.
[3195.44 --> 3195.76]  Okay.
[3196.32 --> 3197.56]  So, wait.
[3197.72 --> 3199.00]  You have the bell or you don't have the bell.
[3199.00 --> 3199.40]  I need you...
[3199.40 --> 3201.08]  Where do you want me to go?
[3204.02 --> 3204.72]  Go up there.
[3204.82 --> 3205.46]  Keep them up there.
[3205.56 --> 3205.72]  Okay.
[3205.96 --> 3206.34]  Now I'll get...
[3206.34 --> 3206.84]  No, I can't.
[3206.84 --> 3207.26]  I can't.
[3207.42 --> 3209.26]  No, I wasn't ready yet.
[3211.34 --> 3211.70]  Okay.
[3211.82 --> 3213.16]  I got this guy frozen.
[3213.74 --> 3214.74]  I got him this time.
[3215.12 --> 3215.44]  Okay.
[3215.62 --> 3215.98]  Don't worry.
[3216.04 --> 3216.44]  I got this.
[3216.44 --> 3218.12]  Actually, I'll get this guy to come down here.
[3218.22 --> 3218.46]  Yeah.
[3222.60 --> 3224.08]  Okay, go get in position on the block.
[3224.22 --> 3225.16]  Go get in position on the block.
[3225.16 --> 3225.88]  Up, up, up, up.
[3226.54 --> 3227.10]  There we go.
[3227.20 --> 3227.52]  There we go.
[3227.56 --> 3227.84]  There we go.
[3227.88 --> 3228.16]  There we go.
[3228.22 --> 3228.74]  Okay, I got them.
[3229.06 --> 3230.34]  So, you're on the block, right?
[3231.04 --> 3231.62]  Now I am.
[3232.94 --> 3234.08]  Go, go, go, go.
[3234.30 --> 3235.24]  Go, go, go.
[3235.40 --> 3235.96]  Go, go.
[3236.02 --> 3237.24]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[3237.48 --> 3238.24]  Okay, we got him.
[3239.56 --> 3240.32]  That didn't open.
[3240.48 --> 3241.94]  It didn't even unlock it.
[3244.60 --> 3245.44]  That's awesome.
[3245.84 --> 3249.12]  I love doing boss fights only to find out you don't have a key.
[3251.26 --> 3252.14]  That's ridiculous.
[3255.16 --> 3255.72]  Okay.
[3256.80 --> 3258.70]  Oh, oh, oh, I just died.
[3259.10 --> 3259.86]  All right, I got hit.
[3261.58 --> 3261.98]  Okay.
[3265.90 --> 3266.30]  What?
[3267.26 --> 3268.68]  We can't get on the other side.
[3269.00 --> 3269.22]  Banana.
[3274.56 --> 3277.80]  If someone made, like, a fruit snack called Banana Hammock, would you eat it?
[3277.80 --> 3282.54]  I don't know.
[3284.06 --> 3284.42]  It would have to be...
[3284.42 --> 3285.48]  Or would that just make you uncomfortable?
[3285.66 --> 3288.16]  Well, it would have to be medically approved, so I'm not too worried about it, I guess.
[3288.58 --> 3289.32]  Medically approved?
[3289.54 --> 3289.78]  Oh.
[3290.32 --> 3290.80]  Wait, one second.
[3291.50 --> 3293.72]  Okay, well, this one can only go this way.
[3295.58 --> 3297.14]  So, that must be a thing.
[3297.58 --> 3298.10]  And then, wait.
[3298.44 --> 3298.70]  Okay.
[3299.26 --> 3299.90]  Oh, no.
[3300.00 --> 3300.32]  Hold on.
[3301.02 --> 3301.78]  That side's easy.
[3302.58 --> 3302.88]  Oh, yeah.
[3302.92 --> 3303.50]  That side's easy.
[3303.64 --> 3304.72]  Where did they all go?
[3305.50 --> 3306.36]  Oh, I get it.
[3306.68 --> 3308.82]  Oh, this one's way easier than the other one.
[3308.88 --> 3309.56]  This one's stupid.
[3310.64 --> 3314.94]  I was, like, trying to figure things out, and it was, like, freaking simple.
[3317.30 --> 3319.64]  We now have the key for that place, by the way.
[3320.00 --> 3323.78]  Okay, so now we get to go fight those guys again.
[3325.30 --> 3326.60]  Hotline Miami is incredible.
[3326.60 --> 3329.22]  And the soundtrack is amazing.
[3330.58 --> 3331.42]  Really good game.
[3334.64 --> 3335.88]  If you're too young or you don't...
[3335.88 --> 3336.24]  Oh, God.
[3336.60 --> 3339.00]  If you're too young or you don't like gore, don't play it.
[3339.90 --> 3340.92]  But it's a really good game.
[3341.24 --> 3342.38]  Too young to like gore, you mean?
[3342.68 --> 3344.38]  Too young or you don't like gore.
[3344.52 --> 3344.78]  Mm.
[3346.06 --> 3346.46]  Okay.
[3346.96 --> 3347.72]  Tell me something.
[3348.64 --> 3351.96]  Did you or your parents ever give any cares about the ratings on games?
[3353.88 --> 3354.80]  Is this not illegal?
[3355.52 --> 3355.80]  What?
[3355.80 --> 3356.76]  This is one of those things.
[3357.36 --> 3358.12]  Is what illegal?
[3358.34 --> 3360.68]  Isn't it not illegal to go against ESRB?
[3363.64 --> 3364.00]  Um.
[3365.40 --> 3366.48]  I don't think so.
[3370.18 --> 3372.02]  This is exactly what I was talking about before, though.
[3372.48 --> 3373.80]  Do we really know?
[3373.88 --> 3374.62]  Here, watch out.
[3375.74 --> 3377.06]  I don't have a bell this time.
[3378.12 --> 3379.26]  Oh, my goodness.
[3379.34 --> 3380.74]  You can't take items around with you?
[3381.58 --> 3382.34]  I have a key.
[3383.42 --> 3385.40]  Right, but see how the bell's not here anymore?
[3385.80 --> 3388.94]  Okay, so here.
[3389.02 --> 3389.30]  Hold on.
[3389.42 --> 3390.44]  Let's bop him when he comes up.
[3392.94 --> 3394.26]  Okay, he's coming this way, so be ready.
[3394.40 --> 3394.66]  Get him.
[3396.22 --> 3397.08]  Okay, that was close.
[3397.14 --> 3397.72]  Thank you for that.
[3398.38 --> 3400.70]  All right, then we'll get one more of them when they go through the gate, and then we'll
[3400.70 --> 3401.98]  get one more over on the very first side.
[3401.98 --> 3403.56]  It's illegal to sell them to someone underage.
[3404.30 --> 3406.78]  Is it illegal to buy one if you're underage?
[3407.02 --> 3409.44]  How can you have, like...
[3409.44 --> 3412.44]  I don't think you can have...
[3412.44 --> 3413.68]  You can.
[3414.18 --> 3416.24]  There are laws where it is illegal to buy something.
[3417.62 --> 3417.90]  Yes.
[3420.70 --> 3421.26]  But...
[3421.26 --> 3423.00]  Okay.
[3423.30 --> 3423.78]  Hold on.
[3423.78 --> 3427.72]  We won't be able to get this block out of here.
[3428.04 --> 3429.04]  I'll go try and get the other guy.
[3429.12 --> 3429.52]  Keep him there.
[3431.62 --> 3432.92]  Or we can use this one, actually.
[3432.96 --> 3434.62]  Yeah, we can use that one to kill the other guy.
[3434.68 --> 3434.84]  Okay, cool.
[3434.84 --> 3434.92]  Yeah.
[3437.62 --> 3438.00]  Okay, but...
[3438.00 --> 3440.56]  ESRB is not legally binding anywhere outside of California.
[3440.70 --> 3440.88]  Okay.
[3442.20 --> 3443.06]  But this is, like...
[3443.06 --> 3444.00]  We didn't know right away.
[3444.10 --> 3445.20]  This is what I was talking about earlier.
[3445.54 --> 3447.50]  How do you really know when there's laws sometimes?
[3447.50 --> 3452.16]  Without spending, like, your entire life reading legal documents.
[3453.02 --> 3454.36]  And even then...
[3454.36 --> 3455.84]  Then you'd be a very boring person.
[3456.06 --> 3457.56]  And even then...
[3457.56 --> 3462.30]  They don't necessarily know, because there's so many laws that cross each other and intertwine
[3462.30 --> 3463.02]  and all this kind of stuff.
[3463.38 --> 3464.16]  It's really interesting.
[3464.96 --> 3466.92]  But, no, my parents didn't really care.
[3467.74 --> 3471.88]  Although, with certain games, like, I think my dad would, like, sit with me for a long enough
[3471.88 --> 3474.48]  time until he could be like, yeah, okay, this is good.
[3474.78 --> 3476.20]  To make sure that you weren't insane.
[3476.88 --> 3477.16]  No.
[3477.50 --> 3479.56]  To make sure that the game wasn't too crazy.
[3481.00 --> 3483.30]  Like, while I was playing the game, he'd, like, hang out for a while.
[3483.30 --> 3485.54]  Okay, so he wasn't gonna let you play, like, Manhunt then.
[3485.92 --> 3486.16]  No.
[3488.52 --> 3490.28]  But, I mean...
[3491.60 --> 3495.26]  Frankly, a lot of the time, the ratings are just kind of stupid.
[3495.90 --> 3496.16]  Oh, yeah.
[3496.34 --> 3496.82]  Ratings are dumb.
[3498.18 --> 3499.74]  Especially on movies, in my opinion.
[3501.86 --> 3502.18]  Yeah.
[3504.82 --> 3507.10]  There are movies that are just not that bad.
[3507.10 --> 3511.96]  That have ratings that would indicate that they're much worse than they are.
[3512.02 --> 3513.62]  Which is sort of the point of the conversation we're having.
[3513.82 --> 3514.74]  Are you gonna hit anything?
[3515.20 --> 3517.06]  I don't have anything left.
[3517.82 --> 3519.00]  Oh, that sucked.
[3519.80 --> 3520.72]  I have to wait.
[3520.94 --> 3522.80]  You hold your arms up and then you can catch the barrels.
[3522.80 --> 3524.92]  Can I catch the bombs, too?
[3524.96 --> 3526.64]  I don't know if I'd recommend it.
[3527.06 --> 3527.42]  Maybe.
[3529.76 --> 3530.60]  But I failed.
[3531.40 --> 3533.80]  I wonder if the barrels even, like, do anything, though.
[3533.84 --> 3535.34]  Because I killed, like, five of them.
[3535.58 --> 3536.14]  Four of them, maybe?
[3536.50 --> 3537.70]  I killed two.
[3537.90 --> 3540.44]  And then I ran out of stuff and didn't realize that I should be holding my hand.
[3540.44 --> 3546.22]  I'm gonna go inside.
[3546.96 --> 3548.06]  Yeah, I think there's only two left.
[3550.12 --> 3551.14]  Oh, that's a shame.
[3552.60 --> 3553.68]  Wow, where do we go?
[3554.00 --> 3555.06]  We have one continue?
[3558.30 --> 3558.88]  That's brutal.
[3558.88 --> 3560.72]  I mean, even, like, a Goofy game.
[3560.82 --> 3561.10]  Press start.
[3562.66 --> 3564.58]  It's, like, unforgivingly hard now.
[3565.36 --> 3566.16]  Or back then.
[3570.60 --> 3571.04]  Ah.
[3572.56 --> 3574.36]  So, diamond is another life.
[3575.18 --> 3576.44]  Ah, yes, you can take bombs.
[3577.20 --> 3578.72]  But maybe you don't hold them for too long.
[3578.72 --> 3580.22]  Yeah, I was just gonna say you should probably get rid of it.
[3580.66 --> 3580.94]  What?
[3581.36 --> 3582.98]  Those ones, I'm assuming, you can't catch, right?
[3582.98 --> 3583.88]  Yeah, I don't think...
[3585.16 --> 3586.86]  Otherwise, there'd be no way for them to kill you.
[3587.18 --> 3588.02]  Oh, my goodness.
[3588.88 --> 3592.56]  Okay.
[3592.74 --> 3593.58]  I got one with the bomb.
[3594.20 --> 3595.36]  It doesn't even explode.
[3595.48 --> 3596.74]  It just, like...
[3596.74 --> 3599.14]  You just get them with the bomb.
[3600.40 --> 3601.24]  That's stupid.
[3601.44 --> 3601.76]  So, what?
[3601.82 --> 3605.02]  Their bombs are, like, OP, ridiculous bombs that explode.
[3605.10 --> 3608.04]  And our bombs, we just have to throw the bomb at them hard enough
[3608.04 --> 3610.46]  that it hurts them enough that they die.
[3611.60 --> 3611.90]  Woo!
[3612.22 --> 3612.62]  Woo!
[3613.88 --> 3614.28]  Okay.
[3614.28 --> 3614.48]  Okay.
[3618.88 --> 3620.48]  MySteamGage?
[3620.52 --> 3621.90]  Is this a new Steam Calculator thing?
[3621.90 --> 3626.66]  Oh, cool!
[3626.78 --> 3628.00]  I wish I knew about that before the stream.
[3628.08 --> 3629.00]  That could have been tip number four.
[3629.16 --> 3629.62]  What's that?
[3630.74 --> 3631.14]  MySteamGage.
[3632.08 --> 3632.92]  MySteamGage.com.
[3633.00 --> 3635.28]  So, you type in your public Steam ID,
[3635.54 --> 3637.32]  and it'll calculate how much your Steam account's worth.
[3637.54 --> 3637.78]  Really?
[3638.04 --> 3638.24]  Yeah.
[3638.50 --> 3639.10]  Oh, I should get...
[3639.10 --> 3640.62]  There used to be Steam Calculator.
[3642.00 --> 3643.64]  And then Steam Calculator went down,
[3643.74 --> 3645.36]  and then they made a Twitter bot that did it,
[3645.42 --> 3646.76]  and then that Twitter bot went down,
[3646.88 --> 3649.36]  and now I guess there's MySteamGage.com.
[3650.18 --> 3650.84]  That's pretty cool.
[3650.92 --> 3651.54]  I'm going to try it.
[3652.36 --> 3652.92]  That's awesome.
[3653.92 --> 3654.80]  Are you not doing it?
[3655.22 --> 3656.36]  I guess I can.
[3656.68 --> 3657.36]  Let's see who wins.
[3658.28 --> 3658.64]  Wins?
[3658.70 --> 3660.10]  What is winning in this, exactly?
[3660.78 --> 3661.14]  More?
[3661.52 --> 3662.28]  More is always better.
[3663.38 --> 3664.22]  Especially in golf.
[3665.18 --> 3666.44]  That's my understanding, anyway.
[3666.44 --> 3669.58]  We should go play golf under that pretense.
[3670.46 --> 3671.86]  We totally should play golf.
[3672.98 --> 3676.26]  Under the rules of whoever has more points?
[3676.50 --> 3679.10]  Whoever is still out there,
[3679.26 --> 3682.30]  and the most points,
[3683.20 --> 3683.62]  wins.
[3688.10 --> 3689.40]  It's taken a little while.
[3689.54 --> 3691.12]  Steam Calculator was pretty much instant.
[3693.08 --> 3695.26]  I can't even find the site, so whatever.
[3695.26 --> 3696.10]  Google...
[3696.10 --> 3697.24]  Oh, Geet Gage.
[3698.06 --> 3699.10]  My Steam Gage.
[3699.50 --> 3700.84]  Steam Calculator is the old one.
[3701.32 --> 3702.08]  It crashed.
[3704.38 --> 3707.52]  I think my Chrome is just, like, broken.
[3707.80 --> 3709.82]  No, I mean, like, people are saying it crashed.
[3710.56 --> 3712.00]  Oh, did we break it?
[3712.64 --> 3713.00]  Maybe.
[3713.28 --> 3713.80]  Dang it.
[3713.84 --> 3714.62]  We crashed it.
[3715.00 --> 3715.24]  No!
[3716.42 --> 3718.32]  Guys, we're trying to do things here.
[3718.32 --> 3719.28]  Okay.
[3719.28 --> 3719.32]  Okay.
[3719.56 --> 3719.82]  Okay.
[3719.90 --> 3724.92]  People have been demanding we dust off Mario Kart since, like, the first after party.
[3724.92 --> 3726.78]  Okay, I'm just going to get schooled.
[3726.84 --> 3729.92]  I haven't played Mario Kart NES or SNES much.
[3730.08 --> 3731.08]  They're not that much different.
[3731.50 --> 3731.86]  Are they?
[3732.28 --> 3732.94]  It's pretty...
[3732.94 --> 3734.84]  Have you ever played the Super Nintendo Mario Kart?
[3734.84 --> 3735.88]  I've never had it.
[3736.10 --> 3737.56]  Oh, it's pretty different.
[3737.86 --> 3738.14]  Okay.
[3738.26 --> 3738.48]  Yeah.
[3738.62 --> 3739.12]  It's 2D.
[3740.12 --> 3740.78]  Oh, wow.
[3741.22 --> 3742.12]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3742.18 --> 3743.20]  I know what I'm going to say.
[3743.34 --> 3743.58]  Yeah.
[3743.66 --> 3744.24]  Okay, so hold on.
[3744.24 --> 3745.14]  I've played it before, yeah.
[3745.30 --> 3746.40]  Just a really long time ago.
[3746.40 --> 3747.30]  Well, yeah, me too.
[3747.48 --> 3748.48]  Like, I've played a couple...
[3748.48 --> 3749.20]  Everyone's played this.
[3749.22 --> 3750.12]  Couple times.
[3750.16 --> 3750.60]  Yeah, exactly.
[3751.00 --> 3751.72]  I never owned it.
[3751.80 --> 3753.12]  Like, one of my buddies had it or something.
[3753.54 --> 3754.90]  Oh, what do you mean you didn't own it?
[3754.92 --> 3756.94]  I thought it was your copy that we were dusting off right now.
[3757.74 --> 3759.62]  Well, I didn't own it.
[3759.76 --> 3763.68]  I have started to collect a retro game library, but I haven't played everything in my retro
[3763.68 --> 3765.62]  game library, because it's quite extensive, apparently.
[3765.72 --> 3766.38]  Quite extensive.
[3766.84 --> 3768.86]  I mean, you have games that you've never played.
[3769.14 --> 3769.36]  Yep.
[3769.44 --> 3770.32]  That is amazing.
[3770.68 --> 3770.86]  Yep.
[3776.44 --> 3776.76]  Hmm.
[3778.48 --> 3779.66]  Oops, this is interesting.
[3779.82 --> 3780.88]  This is not what I meant to do.
[3781.96 --> 3782.64]  All right.
[3783.10 --> 3784.28]  Magical Drop.
[3784.96 --> 3785.36]  Something.
[3787.90 --> 3788.30]  Something.
[3789.54 --> 3790.72]  Mario Paint.
[3791.06 --> 3792.56]  Mario's early years.
[3792.84 --> 3794.58]  I can't believe we crashed Steam Gauge.
[3794.88 --> 3795.30]  I know.
[3795.72 --> 3797.00]  I wanted to try it.
[3797.14 --> 3797.46]  No.
[3798.90 --> 3799.84]  Oh, wait, what?
[3801.94 --> 3802.64]  Did this work?
[3803.86 --> 3804.56]  Oh, right.
[3804.60 --> 3805.58]  I'm looking in the wrong place.
[3805.64 --> 3808.40]  I'm looking under Mario, but it's probably Super Mario Kart.
[3809.24 --> 3814.76]  Oh, the default thing for my Steam Gauge shows you how much drive space it uses.
[3814.98 --> 3817.98]  How many games do you think start with Super for the Super Nintendo?
[3817.98 --> 3820.88]  Super Bomber Man.
[3821.06 --> 3823.50]  Super Chinese language teacher.
[3825.96 --> 3828.28]  Super formatting magazines.
[3829.10 --> 3830.12]  Super Mahjong.
[3830.12 --> 3833.62]  Super Mario Kart.
[3835.62 --> 3836.40]  All right.
[3838.30 --> 3840.24]  You gotta help me or it won't dust off enough.
[3844.74 --> 3845.46]  Mario Kart.
[3846.18 --> 3848.34]  You know, I don't think that's ever going to get old to me anyway.
[3849.94 --> 3850.66]  All right.
[3850.66 --> 3852.44]  1992 Nintendo.
[3857.00 --> 3857.86]  Here we go.
[3859.40 --> 3862.16]  Yeah, this looks like it's going to be kind of ridiculous.
[3863.36 --> 3866.10]  We should play some Mario Kart 64.
[3866.42 --> 3867.44]  That I will school you at.
[3867.58 --> 3867.72]  Yeah.
[3867.72 --> 3868.54]  That I'm good at.
[3868.78 --> 3868.92]  Yeah.
[3869.62 --> 3870.20]  Match race?
[3871.00 --> 3872.32]  I couldn't care.
[3873.12 --> 3874.74]  There was a battle mode for this?
[3875.64 --> 3877.08]  I didn't even know that.
[3877.08 --> 3884.38]  Wow, there was a Koopa?
[3885.16 --> 3885.48]  Yoshi!
[3890.00 --> 3890.94]  All right, we got this.
[3892.94 --> 3893.34]  Epic.
[3893.58 --> 3895.10]  Yeah, I totally remember this.
[3895.44 --> 3896.56]  It's been a really long time.
[3896.90 --> 3898.08]  Should we start off with Mushroom Cup?
[3898.42 --> 3898.74]  Sure.
[3899.06 --> 3900.20]  Should we go straight to Star Cup?
[3900.50 --> 3901.28]  Let's do it.
[3901.90 --> 3902.64]  Just do it?
[3902.90 --> 3903.18]  Sure.
[3903.40 --> 3904.44]  Actually, let's go Flower Cup.
[3904.50 --> 3905.16]  We'll go, we'll go.
[3905.66 --> 3906.00]  Sure.
[3906.36 --> 3906.96]  Donut Plains.
[3907.22 --> 3907.50]  Sure.
[3907.62 --> 3907.88]  We good?
[3908.16 --> 3908.38]  Yep.
[3909.02 --> 3909.72]  Is this okay?
[3910.08 --> 3910.38]  Yes.
[3910.56 --> 3911.30]  All right, we got this.
[3911.80 --> 3913.26]  I have no idea what the controls are.
[3913.46 --> 3913.78]  Me neither.
[3914.46 --> 3915.98]  I'm going to guess B is go.
[3916.12 --> 3916.32]  Yep.
[3919.68 --> 3920.00]  Yep.
[3920.00 --> 3920.32]  Sweet.
[3920.52 --> 3920.94]  How was it?
[3922.62 --> 3922.92]  Okay.
[3923.00 --> 3923.44]  Oh, wow.
[3923.58 --> 3924.08]  Oh, wow.
[3924.32 --> 3924.88]  Oh, wow.
[3925.12 --> 3925.32]  Okay.
[3925.98 --> 3926.46]  I don't know how to...
[3926.46 --> 3927.12]  Are you Yoshi?
[3927.40 --> 3927.68]  Yeah.
[3929.20 --> 3930.10]  Oh, man.
[3930.54 --> 3931.00]  Holy cow.
[3931.28 --> 3932.50]  Okay, I figured out how to use items.
[3933.18 --> 3938.94]  Wow, you stop moving, like, instantly when you let go of the gas.
[3939.34 --> 3940.36]  How do you use items?
[3941.16 --> 3941.60]  Uh, A.
[3943.20 --> 3944.96]  Okay, why do you collect coins?
[3945.60 --> 3946.52]  What is the point of the...
[3946.52 --> 3947.76]  Wow.
[3949.54 --> 3950.94]  Get one of those molds.
[3951.36 --> 3955.28]  This game is confusing as balls compared to 64.
[3957.20 --> 3957.60]  Whoa.
[3957.94 --> 3958.38]  Here we go.
[3958.46 --> 3959.00]  Red shell.
[3959.46 --> 3959.84]  Can you drive...
[3959.84 --> 3961.24]  Oh, you can't drive through the water.
[3961.24 --> 3964.46]  You just plunk in?
[3965.14 --> 3965.50]  Yep.
[3965.78 --> 3968.08]  You just go right in there, just like that.
[3968.08 --> 3968.42]  Oh, wow.
[3968.48 --> 3970.50]  He put me on top of a mole hole.
[3971.98 --> 3972.36]  Okay.
[3972.66 --> 3973.00]  Okay.
[3973.04 --> 3974.78]  Time to start making good time here.
[3975.10 --> 3977.78]  I don't even know if this game has rubber band effect.
[3979.14 --> 3979.94]  Rubber band effect?
[3979.94 --> 3980.86]  Yeah.
[3980.86 --> 3980.90]  Yeah.
[3981.44 --> 3986.08]  Where, uh, the slower racers are automatically sped up to the faster racers.
[3986.72 --> 3989.14]  Because I know, I know modern Mario Kart games do.
[3989.50 --> 3990.78]  They rubber band hardcore.
[3990.96 --> 3992.68]  Not only in the items, but just in general.
[3993.00 --> 3995.52]  Best racing game I've ever played, in my opinion.
[3996.34 --> 3998.28]  Uh, like, racing, not kart racing.
[3998.78 --> 4000.00]  Uh, Need for Speed Underground 2.
[4000.50 --> 4001.06]  Love that game.
[4001.06 --> 4004.72]  I actually played a fair bit of Need for Speed Underground 1, not 2, because I'm old.
[4005.72 --> 4006.98]  One was also really, really good.
[4007.28 --> 4008.22]  Yeah, I quite enjoyed it.
[4008.34 --> 4012.50]  The older Need for Speed games kick the absolute butt out of the new ones.
[4012.86 --> 4014.92]  I haven't even played a newer one at all.
[4014.98 --> 4015.84]  I just heard they're terrible.
[4015.84 --> 4016.22]  They're horrible.
[4016.60 --> 4017.66]  They grabbed the crew.
[4017.66 --> 4018.98]  The mole is on me.
[4019.22 --> 4021.38]  Look, he's, like, rubbing himself in my face.
[4021.66 --> 4023.08]  I'm getting a pole dance.
[4023.34 --> 4024.34]  You have to, like, shake him off or something?
[4024.46 --> 4024.94]  I don't know.
[4025.02 --> 4026.12]  Can I fire up Chell?
[4026.26 --> 4026.52]  No.
[4026.90 --> 4030.36]  What is this?
[4031.80 --> 4032.84]  Why is he on me?
[4032.94 --> 4033.64]  Do I have to go backwards?
[4037.04 --> 4038.62]  I don't even think you can go backwards.
[4039.32 --> 4041.00]  Oh, oh, Steam Gauge just loaded.
[4041.74 --> 4042.84]  You're lapping me.
[4045.84 --> 4047.26]  Weren't you worried you were going to get...
[4047.26 --> 4047.66]  Okay.
[4048.28 --> 4049.50]  This must be a glitch.
[4049.56 --> 4049.70]  Here.
[4050.52 --> 4051.50]  How do you get it off?
[4051.56 --> 4053.14]  I'm not quitting until the race is done.
[4053.20 --> 4055.64]  This is the only time I'm ever going to beat you at a Mario Kart game.
[4056.26 --> 4056.60]  Okay.
[4056.96 --> 4057.82]  Oh, it just ends.
[4059.06 --> 4060.04]  What is that?
[4060.08 --> 4060.94]  I have no idea.
[4061.62 --> 4062.66]  Apparently I got a jump.
[4062.76 --> 4063.84]  I can't find a jump.
[4064.32 --> 4065.18]  I tried all the buttons.
[4065.30 --> 4066.50]  I never jumped.
[4067.14 --> 4068.26]  I tried shoulder buttons.
[4068.34 --> 4069.02]  Didn't do anything.
[4071.74 --> 4072.14]  Alright.
[4072.70 --> 4073.54]  Screw you, hippie.
[4074.36 --> 4075.12]  Oh, pfft.
[4075.12 --> 4076.88]  I didn't know the race even started.
[4077.24 --> 4078.94]  That's why I said screw you, hippie, to help you.
[4080.94 --> 4083.98]  If I didn't want you to notice the race started, I wouldn't have said screw you, hippie.
[4083.98 --> 4084.44]  Oh, no.
[4084.44 --> 4084.58]  Oh.
[4085.64 --> 4086.60]  That's a good sign.
[4087.88 --> 4092.08]  Oh, the graphics are so terrible and the screen is so small.
[4092.30 --> 4092.56]  Okay.
[4092.68 --> 4094.50]  So I have now pressed every single button.
[4095.18 --> 4095.52]  Ha.
[4096.56 --> 4097.84]  You got the mole.
[4098.18 --> 4098.38]  Yeah.
[4098.48 --> 4099.32]  That's why I said, oh, no.
[4099.32 --> 4103.90]  Oh, you got like the sex mole that just wants you for your body.
[4104.42 --> 4106.74]  I remember there being, oh, I am jumping.
[4107.60 --> 4110.24]  Oh, you have to spam the crap out of jump.
[4110.64 --> 4111.90]  It's not just one jump.
[4111.90 --> 4114.02]  Yeah, because that makes perfect sense.
[4114.32 --> 4119.18]  I love it back when game mechanics were just like one of the devs being like, I don't know.
[4119.24 --> 4120.08]  I guess we could do this.
[4121.62 --> 4123.86]  We might as well, I guess this will work.
[4124.22 --> 4126.16]  We haven't used this button yet, so let's prove it.
[4128.00 --> 4128.70]  That's a thing.
[4130.44 --> 4132.00]  There's like no lap counter.
[4132.34 --> 4133.02]  There's no...
[4133.02 --> 4134.04]  There's a lap counter bottom right.
[4135.02 --> 4135.74]  That's not lap.
[4135.74 --> 4136.04]  Or no, it's position.
[4136.16 --> 4137.02]  Yeah, that's position.
[4137.26 --> 4137.62]  Crikey.
[4137.90 --> 4138.80]  Oh, come on.
[4138.80 --> 4143.54]  Okay, thank you for telling me the spam jump thing, because otherwise I would have had
[4143.54 --> 4144.18]  the mole on me.
[4144.20 --> 4145.00]  Yeah, no, stuff like that's lame.
[4145.32 --> 4146.84]  Would have not known what to do at all.
[4147.06 --> 4147.38]  No!
[4148.16 --> 4150.64]  If someone doesn't know a game mechanic, the other person does.
[4150.94 --> 4152.24]  It's usually just boring.
[4152.38 --> 4156.20]  Or if it's a fighting game and neither person knows any game mechanics.
[4156.26 --> 4157.40]  That's the best way to play.
[4157.70 --> 4159.84]  No, apparently that was boring on the stream.
[4160.06 --> 4160.40]  Was it?
[4160.62 --> 4161.78]  I don't think it was boring.
[4161.86 --> 4162.68]  I thought it was awesome.
[4163.24 --> 4166.42]  Should we like both learn fighting game mechanics?
[4166.42 --> 4168.42]  We should totally both learn like...
[4168.98 --> 4170.40]  But like only like Mortal Kombat.
[4171.08 --> 4171.36]  Sure.
[4171.50 --> 4172.98]  And honestly, we don't need to know a ton.
[4173.08 --> 4176.24]  We just need to have like one character that we kind of know the moves for and then it should
[4176.24 --> 4176.56]  be okay.
[4176.74 --> 4176.96]  Cool.
[4177.20 --> 4177.62]  I'm done with that.
[4177.62 --> 4179.94]  Like that one move I know for Raiden helps a lot.
[4180.46 --> 4181.28]  You play Raiden.
[4181.92 --> 4182.08]  Yeah.
[4182.08 --> 4183.14]  I don't know who I'll play.
[4183.16 --> 4185.04]  I'll learn like one other move for him.
[4185.16 --> 4186.90]  Apparently he's like a god or something.
[4187.50 --> 4187.98]  Like if...
[4187.98 --> 4191.90]  I looked him up on Wikipedia because I was just kind of curious about the spelling of the name
[4191.90 --> 4193.78]  because I always thought it was R-A-I-D-N.
[4193.82 --> 4196.02]  Oh, so there's two different spellings of the name.
[4196.02 --> 4197.22]  Two different spellings of the name.
[4198.44 --> 4198.84]  No, no, no.
[4198.90 --> 4200.10]  They're both...
[4200.10 --> 4201.78]  They're both the same guy.
[4201.88 --> 4203.88]  I think it was just randomly spelled differently.
[4203.98 --> 4206.60]  Like you know how older games, they couldn't release a patch.
[4206.84 --> 4207.90]  And they're like, oh crap.
[4208.14 --> 4208.30]  Yeah.
[4208.50 --> 4208.74]  Whoa.
[4210.02 --> 4212.42]  Whoa, we spelled like one of our main character's themes wrong.
[4212.64 --> 4213.04]  Oh well.
[4213.42 --> 4213.66]  Yeah.
[4213.76 --> 4217.44]  We have like six characters in this game and we like typoed one of them.
[4218.02 --> 4218.60]  So like...
[4218.60 --> 4219.08]  I'm sorry.
[4219.08 --> 4222.04]  I was kind of catching up near the end but still not so much.
[4222.46 --> 4222.74]  No.
[4222.90 --> 4223.06]  No.
[4223.14 --> 4224.06]  You got nothing.
[4224.56 --> 4226.28]  You got nothing on my Mario Kart skills.
[4227.80 --> 4228.00]  Hmm.
[4230.18 --> 4230.54]  Hmm.
[4233.38 --> 4234.96]  Do you have to put your numerical ID?
[4236.24 --> 4236.60]  No.
[4236.72 --> 4237.82]  I don't know how this works.
[4237.82 --> 4241.96]  I think you need your numerical ID.
[4242.74 --> 4243.70]  You shouldn't have to.
[4244.84 --> 4246.86]  I'm signing into Steam right now so I can check mine.
[4248.98 --> 4251.34]  You're not signed into mine on something else, are you?
[4252.72 --> 4253.50]  I don't think so.
[4254.10 --> 4255.42]  Even if I am, it shouldn't really matter.
[4255.88 --> 4257.16]  I was trying to start without you there.
[4257.34 --> 4257.70]  I know.
[4257.84 --> 4258.96]  That's why I grabbed my controller.
[4259.50 --> 4260.16]  I was like, jerk.
[4260.16 --> 4263.82]  What do you want to do?
[4264.22 --> 4264.40]  Hmm?
[4264.50 --> 4264.80]  Let's go.
[4264.80 --> 4265.14]  Change course.
[4265.64 --> 4266.24]  Oh, we can try.
[4266.52 --> 4267.36]  Or we can change the course.
[4267.44 --> 4267.92]  Yeah, change course.
[4271.18 --> 4272.06]  Okay, I'm on Steam now.
[4273.64 --> 4274.74]  We could do...
[4274.74 --> 4275.98]  Mario Circuit 3.
[4276.12 --> 4277.16]  Mario Circuit 3.
[4277.46 --> 4278.54]  That sounds outstanding.
[4278.54 --> 4278.68]  It looks the same.
[4279.10 --> 4280.70]  Yeah, it looks like the same bloody thing.
[4282.00 --> 4285.52]  I think they all kind of look the same at that point.
[4286.50 --> 4287.46]  Oh, whoa, are we going?
[4287.46 --> 4290.94]  Okay, I want to find out how much my Steam account's worth after that.
[4291.98 --> 4293.32]  Mine doesn't seem to be working.
[4293.98 --> 4296.60]  Oh, you should totally hit tubes and then they should do stuff.
[4297.34 --> 4298.24]  By the way, here you go.
[4300.76 --> 4302.22]  Did that even do much to you?
[4302.66 --> 4302.90]  Yeah.
[4303.48 --> 4304.86]  Stop me from moving completely.
[4305.00 --> 4306.44]  Spun me around in a circle and you passed me.
[4307.42 --> 4307.66]  Oh.
[4307.96 --> 4309.96]  I guess I didn't notice because it looked like your regular driving.
[4310.68 --> 4310.96]  Wow.
[4310.96 --> 4311.52]  Hey-oh!
[4313.62 --> 4315.76]  Is that not the most annoying noise in the world?
[4316.56 --> 4316.96]  I know.
[4318.28 --> 4320.04]  Whoa, they have like speed lines.
[4321.00 --> 4323.56]  Wow, you only get items once per lap.
[4324.34 --> 4325.40]  That's kind of interesting.
[4326.04 --> 4327.36]  What does a coin do?
[4327.52 --> 4329.40]  Whoa, what's the...
[4329.40 --> 4331.28]  What do coins even do in this game?
[4331.34 --> 4332.84]  I don't understand the coin mechanic.
[4333.76 --> 4335.56]  You can like throw them up to yourself.
[4335.72 --> 4336.98]  You can capture them.
[4337.30 --> 4339.66]  You can hit stuff and then all the coins pop out.
[4340.94 --> 4342.56]  Maybe it's bonus score at the other end?
[4343.02 --> 4344.34]  Maybe it's like Sonic style.
[4344.34 --> 4347.98]  Well, no, because if it was Sonic style, then the coin would do something to help you in
[4347.98 --> 4348.36]  some way.
[4350.62 --> 4350.94]  Oh!
[4350.94 --> 4351.30]  Oh!
[4351.84 --> 4352.20]  Wow.
[4352.32 --> 4355.32]  So when you miss the item, you have no item for an entire lap.
[4356.28 --> 4357.12]  Can you cut corners?
[4357.24 --> 4357.76]  Like, does that work?
[4358.16 --> 4358.62]  Whoa, hey.
[4359.04 --> 4359.56]  Yeah, that worked.
[4360.74 --> 4361.84]  I should just cut all the corners.
[4362.16 --> 4362.48]  Ugh.
[4362.76 --> 4363.42]  Oh, okay.
[4363.66 --> 4364.98]  Well, not quite all the corners.
[4365.20 --> 4366.14]  Just some of the corners.
[4366.76 --> 4367.74]  Just like the good corners.
[4367.74 --> 4368.88]  Oh, okay.
[4369.08 --> 4372.72]  So when you don't have a coin, I think hitting obstacles spins you out a lot worse.
[4372.88 --> 4373.80]  Oh, my God.
[4373.94 --> 4374.76]  That was really bad.
[4375.30 --> 4376.32]  Oh, and I hit the wall, Slick.
[4379.64 --> 4380.84]  Go, go, go, go.
[4380.92 --> 4381.52]  Get him, get him.
[4381.82 --> 4382.80]  Okay, I need an item this time.
[4382.86 --> 4383.04]  Okay.
[4383.20 --> 4384.50]  All I need is one red shell.
[4385.72 --> 4386.72]  Red shell for victory.
[4387.48 --> 4388.72]  And I got a mushroom.
[4390.20 --> 4392.04]  That should still probably help a lot.
[4392.04 --> 4396.40]  And I used that mushroom to go smacking into a wall.
[4397.56 --> 4399.42]  Which did not help, by the way.
[4399.92 --> 4400.64]  Just saying.
[4401.22 --> 4402.86]  Well, if you didn't fail at it.
[4403.48 --> 4405.94]  Well, sometimes failure is unavoidable.
[4406.78 --> 4407.72]  Not that time.
[4408.54 --> 4409.90]  Oh, my gosh.
[4410.00 --> 4412.20]  Speaking of failure, I didn't get an item again.
[4413.94 --> 4416.64]  I assumed that was going somewhere more interesting.
[4419.66 --> 4420.10]  Wow.
[4420.10 --> 4423.30]  Why do you ever assume anything I'm going to say is going to be interesting?
[4424.18 --> 4426.36]  Because we have a show.
[4426.76 --> 4428.42]  We try and say things that are interesting.
[4428.56 --> 4429.12]  Okay, here we go.
[4429.14 --> 4429.44]  Here we go.
[4429.46 --> 4429.82]  Here we go.
[4430.26 --> 4430.72]  Come on.
[4431.98 --> 4433.22]  No, I missed it.
[4433.40 --> 4434.18]  Next talk.
[4434.38 --> 4434.78]  No.
[4436.10 --> 4437.10]  I hate this game.
[4437.16 --> 4437.82]  This game is stupid.
[4438.02 --> 4438.30]  Wow.
[4442.40 --> 4443.30]  I don't really...
[4446.18 --> 4446.58]  Okay.
[4446.96 --> 4448.70]  So where do you find your ID?
[4450.10 --> 4451.90]  Help.
[4453.82 --> 4454.14]  Mmm.
[4454.94 --> 4455.42]  Steam.
[4457.92 --> 4458.48]  Change...
[4458.48 --> 4459.24]  Oh, no, no.
[4460.72 --> 4461.04]  Settings.
[4463.52 --> 4466.30]  It used to be so easy to find your...
[4466.30 --> 4470.30]  Your...
[4470.30 --> 4472.74]  Your number.
[4472.74 --> 4476.22]  I don't think you need your number, dude.
[4478.10 --> 4479.80]  But how could it be your...
[4479.80 --> 4480.88]  Just your public thing?
[4480.92 --> 4482.38]  I think you have to go...
[4482.38 --> 4484.00]  That used to work on Steam Calculator.
[4484.28 --> 4486.74]  I think now you have to go to...
[4487.62 --> 4488.92]  Like your profile page?
[4489.68 --> 4490.08]  Yeah.
[4491.98 --> 4492.38]  Community.
[4492.88 --> 4493.36]  Okay.
[4493.64 --> 4495.08]  So I'm in the community page.
[4495.08 --> 4498.06]  And now what?
[4498.96 --> 4499.80]  It's just your profile.
[4499.96 --> 4500.64]  Go to your...
[4500.64 --> 4501.14]  There we go.
[4501.30 --> 4502.10]  So it's...
[4502.10 --> 4502.96]  This number then.
[4504.28 --> 4504.68]  Yeah.
[4504.74 --> 4505.94]  Oh, so you never set one.
[4506.94 --> 4507.34]  Oh.
[4507.52 --> 4508.10]  You have to do that?
[4508.78 --> 4509.36]  Uh, yeah.
[4509.46 --> 4510.82]  I don't remember how or where it is.
[4510.88 --> 4513.68]  I think they're automatically set now, but for people with legacy accounts?
[4514.54 --> 4515.82]  I'm legacy like that.
[4516.04 --> 4516.24]  Yeah.
[4516.76 --> 4517.82]  I'm like Manny Legacy.
[4517.82 --> 4520.68]  I set mine because it was too annoying to deal with.
[4522.62 --> 4523.02]  No.
[4523.18 --> 4523.36]  Yeah.
[4523.42 --> 4524.62]  It's trying to do something here.
[4531.36 --> 4531.76]  Alright.
[4531.90 --> 4532.16]  Let's...
[4532.16 --> 4535.00]  Let's dust off another game because that was actually super boring.
[4536.22 --> 4536.78]  Get it?
[4536.88 --> 4539.92]  Super boring because it's a Nintendo game for Super Nintendo.
[4541.10 --> 4542.26]  Super boring.
[4542.26 --> 4547.00]  You should see if there's a game in our collection called Super Boring Simulator.
[4547.82 --> 4549.10]  I'm pretty sure there isn't.
[4549.18 --> 4550.58]  I don't think I've ever bought that game.
[4551.48 --> 4551.72]  No.
[4552.30 --> 4553.08]  No, I don't think so.
[4553.26 --> 4555.24]  Super Magikom...
[4555.24 --> 4556.08]  Something...
[4556.08 --> 4557.00]  Super...
[4557.00 --> 4557.98]  Super Loop?
[4560.10 --> 4561.12]  Super Mahjong?
[4561.26 --> 4563.36]  Man, there's a lot of Mahjong games for Super Nintendo.
[4563.80 --> 4564.02]  Yep.
[4568.84 --> 4570.78]  Super Mario RPG is such a good game.
[4572.22 --> 4573.38]  Man, I love that game.
[4574.28 --> 4575.24]  Never really played it.
[4575.30 --> 4575.76]  Never had it.
[4576.14 --> 4577.44]  Super Nazi Rush?
[4578.82 --> 4579.66]  No, I'm just kidding.
[4580.76 --> 4582.52]  I was like, what?
[4585.20 --> 4586.84]  Holy cow, that was really difficult.
[4587.90 --> 4589.06]  Super Pro Fighter.
[4590.16 --> 4592.32]  Steam's Captcha is brutal.
[4593.18 --> 4594.48]  I took a lot of attempts.
[4594.84 --> 4595.04]  Really?
[4595.34 --> 4595.66]  Yeah.
[4596.06 --> 4599.28]  And there's like percentages and and signs and like...
[4599.28 --> 4599.96]  It's crazy.
[4600.24 --> 4601.66]  Holy crap, Super Star Wars.
[4602.94 --> 4603.50]  You want to play?
[4603.50 --> 4604.06]  Sure.
[4605.20 --> 4606.66]  I'm pretty much down for whatever.
[4608.22 --> 4609.78]  Super Star Wars sounds awesome.
[4610.52 --> 4612.22]  It's Super and it's Star Wars.
[4612.36 --> 4612.84]  And it's Star Wars.
[4613.02 --> 4614.90]  And old Star Wars games are so legit.
[4615.64 --> 4616.36]  It's so true.
[4617.36 --> 4618.82]  Alright, Super Star Wars.
[4618.96 --> 4619.60]  Here we go.
[4620.46 --> 4622.08]  I think we'll have to take turns on this one.
[4622.46 --> 4622.98]  That's fine.
[4622.98 --> 4625.70]  Are you player one again?
[4626.28 --> 4628.98]  Oh no, it's just LucasArts makes you watch their stupid...
[4629.92 --> 4630.90]  In stereo!
[4632.98 --> 4633.26]  Dun!
[4633.90 --> 4634.62]  Dun-da-da!
[4635.04 --> 4636.76]  Dun-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da!
[4637.60 --> 4638.82]  Dun-da-da-da-da!
[4638.92 --> 4639.42]  Dun-da-da-da!
[4639.42 --> 4639.50]  Dun-da-da-da!
[4639.50 --> 4641.62]  Difficulty is easy, brave, or Jedi.
[4642.38 --> 4643.58]  I guess we'll go with brave.
[4644.24 --> 4644.44]  Sure.
[4644.44 --> 4646.46]  And the control pad is whatever it is.
[4646.52 --> 4647.86]  I guess we'll figure that out as we go.
[4649.74 --> 4652.30]  Okay, I think I crashed Steam Gage again.
[4655.12 --> 4655.96]  Here we go.
[4657.06 --> 4659.16]  A long time ago in a galaxy far away.
[4659.22 --> 4661.36]  I guess we'll skip the intro because it seems kind of irrelevant.
[4663.14 --> 4664.74]  This is ridiculous.
[4665.80 --> 4667.04]  Dune Sea, Luke Ready.
[4667.04 --> 4668.28]  Choo-choo!
[4668.78 --> 4669.34]  Choo-choo!
[4669.70 --> 4670.54]  Choo-choo!
[4671.02 --> 4671.50]  Choo-choo!
[4671.50 --> 4671.64]  Choo-choo!
[4671.92 --> 4673.52]  Oh yeah, you get like hearts and stuff.
[4673.58 --> 4674.30]  I've played this game.
[4674.44 --> 4675.26]  This game's awesome.
[4676.06 --> 4676.42]  Whoa.
[4677.10 --> 4677.46]  Whoa!
[4678.46 --> 4679.96]  I don't remember if you can like duck.
[4680.10 --> 4682.18]  But like your health's like a lightsaber and stuff.
[4684.66 --> 4686.24]  Oh, I know this game!
[4686.32 --> 4687.56]  One of my friends owned this.
[4688.70 --> 4691.60]  One of your friends owned, period, if you had this game.
[4691.80 --> 4692.56]  So, yeah.
[4694.24 --> 4695.16]  This game's awesome.
[4695.74 --> 4696.74]  Yeah, this game's awesome.
[4696.74 --> 4700.48]  I don't think I ever played Star Wars, but I played Empire and I played Jedi.
[4701.18 --> 4702.56]  I rented them, actually.
[4702.98 --> 4704.24]  Back when game rentals mattered.
[4704.44 --> 4705.18]  Right.
[4705.18 --> 4705.86]  Look at him.
[4705.86 --> 4707.36]  He's all like, whoa, look at me.
[4707.42 --> 4708.50]  I'm a friggin' Jedi.
[4708.74 --> 4712.38]  I'm just gonna like flip all over the place because that's not a total waste of energy.
[4714.26 --> 4714.70]  Okay.
[4714.86 --> 4715.18]  Hold on.
[4715.22 --> 4715.74]  There's a slide.
[4717.28 --> 4717.72]  Okay.
[4718.54 --> 4720.58]  What is that thing extending at me?
[4721.26 --> 4724.82]  It's made of two smaller scorpions because that makes perfect sense.
[4725.20 --> 4727.32]  Remember when games didn't have to make any sense?
[4727.32 --> 4728.52]  I love this.
[4728.52 --> 4728.54]  I love that.
[4728.54 --> 4728.90]  Yeah.
[4731.48 --> 4732.86]  Oh, there was a big heart.
[4732.92 --> 4733.48]  I didn't get it.
[4735.00 --> 4737.50]  Oh, I think big hearts give you more health overall.
[4738.86 --> 4741.50]  What mattered more was like the actual game mechanic.
[4741.88 --> 4744.12]  Like, is the game mechanic splitting into two?
[4744.24 --> 4744.46]  Interesting.
[4744.80 --> 4745.02]  Yes.
[4745.02 --> 4745.84]  Okay, do it.
[4745.84 --> 4749.36]  Bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop.
[4749.36 --> 4750.36]  Yes.
[4750.36 --> 4750.66]  All right.
[4750.66 --> 4750.94]  Following.
[4750.94 --> 4755.00]  I love how hearts fill up your lightsaber because whatever, man.
[4755.36 --> 4756.26]  Yeah, exactly.
[4756.58 --> 4760.82]  It's like, well, we saw, like, Zelda once, so we were like, okay.
[4760.82 --> 4764.40]  Oh, my blaster's twice as powerful now.
[4766.62 --> 4767.30]  That's epic.
[4769.22 --> 4770.36]  Wow, that makes a big difference.
[4770.66 --> 4772.00]  I love how big the scorpions are.
[4772.72 --> 4773.76]  Just like, because whatever.
[4774.22 --> 4776.18]  We're just big scorpions all up in your biz.
[4777.06 --> 4780.80]  We're just, like, random free, like, not in the movies at all.
[4781.28 --> 4784.44]  Like, random ass, like, aliens aliens.
[4785.18 --> 4786.64]  And, like, what is that thing?
[4787.62 --> 4788.68]  Where are the sand people?
[4789.02 --> 4790.18]  Where are the Jawas?
[4790.18 --> 4791.42]  Because no one cares.
[4791.86 --> 4792.96]  Because whatever.
[4795.46 --> 4796.80]  This level's kind of long.
[4798.10 --> 4798.86]  It's kind of easy.
[4801.44 --> 4803.84]  And, like, birds just explode when you hit them.
[4805.12 --> 4807.86]  And, like, a really big explosion.
[4808.08 --> 4810.36]  And then their, like, heart pops out and you, like, eat it.
[4810.50 --> 4811.56]  And then you take their strength.
[4811.82 --> 4813.08]  And your lightsaber gets bigger.
[4813.28 --> 4813.56]  Yeah.
[4814.68 --> 4816.34]  Yeah, when I, you know what?
[4818.18 --> 4819.78]  My lightsaber always gets bigger.
[4820.18 --> 4820.98]  Oh, come on.
[4822.50 --> 4823.42]  So, Steam Guard.
[4823.56 --> 4825.64]  It took me, like, six times to get through their capture.
[4826.20 --> 4830.40]  And then they sent me the email for, uh, two-step.
[4830.86 --> 4833.90]  And they're like, yeah, make sure it's at least six characters long.
[4833.90 --> 4834.70]  We just sent you an email.
[4834.70 --> 4834.72]  And we just sent you an email.
[4834.72 --> 4835.74]  And it's five characters long.
[4837.38 --> 4837.82]  Okay.
[4838.08 --> 4838.48]  Look.
[4838.88 --> 4840.28]  Or, when you can.
[4840.96 --> 4841.72]  Five characters long.
[4841.72 --> 4846.14]  I am busy kicking so much scorpion butt that you wouldn't even believe it.
[4846.76 --> 4847.96]  Where's my lightsaber?
[4848.46 --> 4849.60]  Where's, like, Obi-Wan?
[4849.72 --> 4850.74]  You probably get it later.
[4850.90 --> 4852.08]  When's he gonna dig out that old relic?
[4852.88 --> 4853.28]  Whoa.
[4853.28 --> 4853.40]  Whoa.
[4853.40 --> 4855.12]  I almost did a Sarlacc.
[4855.50 --> 4855.80]  Whoa.
[4856.04 --> 4856.42]  Oh, yeah.
[4856.60 --> 4858.76]  Because that makes all the sense in the world.
[4858.84 --> 4861.42]  You fight the Sarlacc in A New Hope.
[4861.54 --> 4862.42]  Because whatever.
[4863.12 --> 4864.76]  Because we're, like, LucasArts.
[4864.76 --> 4866.98]  You can shoot his, uh, the things he spits in.
[4867.66 --> 4868.56]  Yeah, I saw that.
[4868.66 --> 4869.52]  I was just missing them.
[4872.56 --> 4873.78]  See, I can't hit them.
[4873.78 --> 4874.72]  Yeah, it's at a bad angle.
[4876.12 --> 4876.44]  What?
[4877.26 --> 4879.42]  I love games that have no difficulty.
[4879.54 --> 4880.44]  And then you get to a boss.
[4880.54 --> 4881.86]  And it's like, you're dead.
[4882.10 --> 4882.52]  Boom.
[4882.70 --> 4883.48]  And you start over.
[4883.60 --> 4884.06]  You're up.
[4884.64 --> 4885.40]  Blaster's Y.
[4885.98 --> 4886.34]  I don't know.
[4886.36 --> 4889.06]  There might be other buttons that do useful things that, like, would help.
[4889.06 --> 4889.30]  Boom.
[4891.06 --> 4893.20]  Okay, I'm trying to spice the engage thing now.
[4893.78 --> 4894.76]  And I'm eating blueberries.
[4894.76 --> 4898.04]  And there's, like, no checkpoint.
[4898.36 --> 4901.92]  It's just, like, oh, and you don't get to keep the upgraded blaster.
[4902.04 --> 4903.04]  No, I noticed that.
[4908.28 --> 4908.76]  Whoa.
[4911.32 --> 4911.84]  It's...
[4911.84 --> 4912.28]  It's...
[4912.28 --> 4917.38]  Shooting on angles is so sketchy in, like, platform-y kind of games.
[4917.66 --> 4918.04]  Oh, I know.
[4918.08 --> 4918.42]  It's ridiculous.
[4918.92 --> 4920.14]  Because it's like, what the hell?
[4921.26 --> 4923.98]  You're at a slightly different angle than the currently supported angle.
[4923.98 --> 4925.10]  I just got phoned.
[4925.64 --> 4926.50]  You're dead?
[4926.58 --> 4926.78]  Yep.
[4927.36 --> 4928.38]  How did you die?
[4928.42 --> 4929.28]  It was so easy.
[4929.46 --> 4933.48]  I jumped up, hit a bird, landed on a scorpion, jumped up to try and get away from him, hit
[4933.48 --> 4935.32]  the bird again, fell back down, hit the scorpion.
[4936.14 --> 4939.14]  But, like, everything dispenses nourishing hearts.
[4939.92 --> 4941.14]  I was trying to run through it quickly.
[4941.38 --> 4942.44]  Because I thought people would get bored.
[4943.04 --> 4943.58]  I'm bored.
[4944.12 --> 4944.40]  Yeah.
[4944.40 --> 4945.40]  I don't know.
[4946.06 --> 4949.92]  We should find some games that are, like, have more of a competitive element to them.
[4951.00 --> 4952.10]  You know what's a really good one?
[4952.52 --> 4953.50]  NHL PA 93.
[4958.00 --> 4960.78]  What are some of our other after-party discussion topics?
[4960.86 --> 4961.24]  Do you have any?
[4962.54 --> 4965.60]  I can't figure out how to get my Google Docs working, so I don't know.
[4965.76 --> 4966.14]  I give up.
[4967.28 --> 4967.98]  Your sandals.
[4967.98 --> 4970.94]  Ah, my sandals broke.
[4971.36 --> 4971.72]  Yes.
[4972.28 --> 4973.34]  So, funny story.
[4973.96 --> 4978.74]  My aunt actually bought me new sandals when I showed her the deplorable state of mind.
[4978.82 --> 4980.82]  Because they're completely broken.
[4981.62 --> 4984.10]  And, like, you've seen my sandals, right?
[4984.10 --> 4984.20]  Yeah.
[4984.38 --> 4987.34]  Like, they're just completely broken.
[4987.56 --> 4987.86]  Oh, yeah.
[4988.62 --> 4990.94]  Like, the straps are coming off.
[4991.06 --> 4995.54]  The bottoms are, like, not attached anymore.
[4995.78 --> 4997.28]  And, like, just, they're terrible.
[4997.28 --> 4999.00]  And I was like, no, I love these sandals.
[4999.04 --> 4999.64]  Don't worry about it.
[4999.84 --> 5005.66]  So, she got me new sandals because she's a good aunt and, you know, she thinks that my feet shouldn't die or something.
[5006.00 --> 5007.82]  And I was like, no, I don't even want new sandals.
[5007.92 --> 5008.64]  I love these sandals.
[5008.68 --> 5010.10]  Because I've been wearing them for, like, three years.
[5010.74 --> 5011.04]  I don't know.
[5011.24 --> 5015.20]  Like, have I, have you seen me wear anything but those sandals or my riding boots since you met me?
[5015.58 --> 5016.34]  Technically, yes.
[5017.38 --> 5017.92]  Ah, okay.
[5018.00 --> 5019.12]  Other than, like, CES.
[5019.32 --> 5019.54]  No.
[5020.26 --> 5020.48]  Yeah.
[5020.94 --> 5022.08]  So, I love those sandals.
[5022.08 --> 5027.66]  So, it was, you know, it was hard for me to accept that I had to replace them with something else.
[5027.68 --> 5031.40]  So, anyway, I even went as far as I was kind of trolling her.
[5031.62 --> 5036.30]  And I left the new sandals at her house and tried to get out the door without taking them with me.
[5036.62 --> 5040.42]  And she was just, like, she, like, ran to my car.
[5040.56 --> 5042.98]  Meanwhile, I'm, like, trying to get into my car as quickly as I can.
[5042.98 --> 5045.74]  I mean, I have, like, a pretty good relationship with my aunt.
[5045.80 --> 5046.56]  I was just teasing her.
[5046.80 --> 5046.90]  Yeah.
[5046.98 --> 5050.26]  But she was like, you are taking these with you, mister.
[5050.80 --> 5053.02]  And I was like, okay, fine.
[5054.04 --> 5054.48]  Fine.
[5054.84 --> 5055.54]  So, get this.
[5055.90 --> 5057.86]  Next day, boom, sandals dead.
[5058.68 --> 5061.30]  I was accidentally stepping on one of the, uh.
[5061.30 --> 5062.28]  She probably sabotaged them.
[5062.50 --> 5064.38]  No, no, I actually don't think so.
[5064.46 --> 5065.64]  That's, that's not in her nature.
[5066.20 --> 5067.38]  She wouldn't sabotage them.
[5067.50 --> 5069.36]  Because she would tell me outright that I'm an idiot.
[5069.36 --> 5074.42]  And, uh, yeah, so next day, boom, sandals dead.
[5074.68 --> 5076.72]  I was, uh, stepping on them by accident.
[5076.86 --> 5077.72]  And I went to pick them up.
[5077.94 --> 5079.06]  And the strap broke.
[5080.20 --> 5081.74]  Okay, I'm at the Sarlacc monster.
[5082.64 --> 5083.32]  Okay, Sarlacc.
[5083.32 --> 5083.76]  Good luck, sir.
[5086.82 --> 5087.78]  Okay, I got this.
[5089.16 --> 5090.36]  Ah, so that's the trick.
[5090.44 --> 5091.32]  You don't shoot up at an angle.
[5091.46 --> 5091.88]  You just jump.
[5092.20 --> 5092.46]  Yep.
[5092.86 --> 5093.42]  Jump and shoot.
[5093.72 --> 5094.68]  Oh, come on.
[5095.12 --> 5095.56]  No!
[5095.90 --> 5097.10]  Go away, Sarlacc!
[5097.20 --> 5097.92]  Go away!
[5098.02 --> 5098.28]  Ah!
[5099.36 --> 5102.32]  I heard that's what, like, the good game streamers do, is they, like, yell.
[5102.42 --> 5103.16]  Just scream?
[5103.32 --> 5103.78]  Yeah, just scream.
[5103.86 --> 5105.02]  Ah, Sarlacc!
[5105.10 --> 5105.38]  Ah!
[5106.32 --> 5107.46]  It's actually really annoying.
[5107.66 --> 5107.88]  Yeah.
[5108.34 --> 5109.84]  Wow, he moves really fast now.
[5110.02 --> 5111.48]  And I think he, like, chases you.
[5111.86 --> 5112.46]  Pretty good.
[5113.10 --> 5114.38]  Ah, Sarlacc!
[5114.66 --> 5115.72]  No, we're all helping!
[5116.64 --> 5119.42]  This isn't even what the Sarlacc looks like in the game.
[5119.52 --> 5120.40]  This is stupid.
[5120.40 --> 5121.80]  I'm in the show of the movie.
[5123.06 --> 5124.14]  Yeah, I'm in the movie.
[5124.14 --> 5127.36]  I know that Star Wars is more than just a game.
[5127.72 --> 5129.92]  In fact, there's nothing game about Star Wars.
[5130.66 --> 5131.90]  Except that it's got game.
[5132.56 --> 5132.72]  Oh.
[5133.18 --> 5133.68]  Hey-oh!
[5134.18 --> 5135.82]  So Steam's just broken right now.
[5136.58 --> 5139.10]  First of all, they sent me a five-character one instead of a six-character one.
[5139.18 --> 5141.60]  And then I did it again, and they sent me an email, but it's empty.
[5143.04 --> 5143.44]  Um.
[5143.56 --> 5144.24]  There's no content.
[5144.24 --> 5147.00]  Oh, they're probably getting hit really hard for Summer Sale.
[5147.14 --> 5147.24]  Yeah.
[5147.24 --> 5151.12]  It's probably, yeah, just a bad time in general to be trying to do anything with Steam.
[5151.44 --> 5151.74]  Yeah.
[5151.94 --> 5153.18]  All right, I got this, Sarlacc.
[5153.64 --> 5155.20]  I just tamed the Sarlacc.
[5157.10 --> 5158.70]  Bring it on, Sarlacc.
[5159.98 --> 5160.42]  Okay.
[5160.98 --> 5162.14]  Got the rhythm down now.
[5162.34 --> 5162.86]  There we go.
[5163.06 --> 5163.38]  Got him.
[5163.88 --> 5164.38]  Okay, you're up.
[5165.60 --> 5168.70]  I am officially a better Luke Skywalker than you.
[5169.30 --> 5169.60]  Cool.
[5169.60 --> 5175.12]  I don't know if you get to play as any other characters.
[5178.48 --> 5179.06]  What's it called?
[5179.16 --> 5179.70]  Steam a what now?
[5183.60 --> 5184.04]  Steam...
[5184.04 --> 5184.60]  Steam Cage.
[5188.36 --> 5189.46]  All right, let's try this.
[5191.58 --> 5192.02]  What?
[5193.30 --> 5194.70]  Oh, these are awesome!
[5195.40 --> 5197.14]  Shoot the Jawas, or the Sand People.
[5197.36 --> 5197.96]  Yeah, Jawas.
[5198.06 --> 5198.46]  Jawas.
[5198.46 --> 5199.26]  Get the Jawas.
[5200.26 --> 5201.22]  Boom, boom, boom.
[5201.28 --> 5201.78]  Get the hearts.
[5201.84 --> 5202.42]  We got the hearts.
[5202.54 --> 5203.04]  Jawas.
[5204.22 --> 5205.36]  Boom, boom, boom, boom.
[5205.74 --> 5207.74]  Oh, no, you just killed your own, uh...
[5207.74 --> 5209.08]  Oh, those are what I'm trying to protect?
[5209.26 --> 5210.08]  I have no idea, man.
[5210.74 --> 5212.46]  I have no idea.
[5212.86 --> 5214.48]  This is ridiculous.
[5214.82 --> 5217.70]  But C-3PO's in there, so, like, he's a boss.
[5218.74 --> 5219.94]  I got a health power up.
[5222.52 --> 5222.92]  Whoa.
[5222.92 --> 5232.90]  The great thing about this is, like, this proves that George Lucas didn't have a single unique
[5232.90 --> 5236.40]  idea for The Phantom Menace, because this is basically the climax of that movie.
[5236.40 --> 5239.68]  Oh, no.
[5239.68 --> 5241.00]  That was bad.
[5241.06 --> 5241.86]  Whoa, you can go up?
[5242.22 --> 5244.32]  No, I hit a rock, so it, like, bounced me.
[5244.32 --> 5244.94]  Oh, no, no.
[5246.94 --> 5247.30]  Ah.
[5248.18 --> 5249.94]  You, like, just have to keep spinning.
[5252.44 --> 5254.92]  Like, I've almost never stopped spinning.
[5254.92 --> 5261.14]  And even though you're hovering, you can't go over mud, because that makes sense.
[5261.28 --> 5261.82]  What's happening?
[5262.00 --> 5262.48]  There we go.
[5262.70 --> 5262.96]  Oh.
[5263.56 --> 5263.96]  Oh.
[5265.04 --> 5266.20]  Oh, okay.
[5266.74 --> 5267.60]  You got this now?
[5268.60 --> 5271.54]  There's some additional controls that I didn't understand.
[5272.58 --> 5274.22]  Why can't I turn now?
[5276.98 --> 5279.52]  I no longer have the ability to turn.
[5280.98 --> 5281.50]  Um.
[5281.68 --> 5283.02]  I can strafe.
[5283.02 --> 5285.22]  Just strafe everything.
[5286.84 --> 5287.88]  Don't worry, you'll be fine.
[5287.96 --> 5288.44]  It's all good.
[5291.38 --> 5292.62]  Head towards the Sandcrawler.
[5292.72 --> 5293.60]  Go, go, go, go, go.
[5293.68 --> 5294.58]  Where's the Sandcrawler?
[5294.60 --> 5294.80]  Left.
[5294.98 --> 5295.26]  Horizon.
[5296.48 --> 5297.40]  Oh, yeah, okay.
[5297.52 --> 5297.74]  I see it.
[5298.10 --> 5299.48]  Thank goodness it's in front of you, hey?
[5299.54 --> 5301.20]  Because if you couldn't turn, and...
[5301.20 --> 5302.74]  I'm just strafing right now.
[5302.98 --> 5304.16]  Yeah, I can't turn at all.
[5306.30 --> 5309.08]  Everyone keeps going to my steam gauge, making it so that I can't use it.
[5309.08 --> 5313.04]  And it just, like, randomly zones out.
[5313.26 --> 5314.92]  We should find another website to take down.
[5316.34 --> 5316.66]  Hmm.
[5317.96 --> 5318.40]  Hmm.
[5320.48 --> 5322.22]  Like Linus Tech Tips Forum.
[5322.74 --> 5324.38]  Yeah, everyone go to Linus Tech Tips Forum.
[5324.60 --> 5325.78]  Those guys.
[5325.78 --> 5327.50]  I hate those guys.
[5327.70 --> 5329.64]  Those freaking jerks.
[5330.32 --> 5333.84]  I love how in the movie it's like, you know, Luke's a good guy.
[5334.36 --> 5341.84]  And here, he's just, like, blowing away harmless Jawas for no reason at all.
[5341.84 --> 5345.30]  It's just, like, merciless.
[5345.36 --> 5347.28]  It's like the whole Han shot first argument.
[5348.16 --> 5348.36]  Right.
[5348.56 --> 5350.84]  Which, by the way, he did, but...
[5351.60 --> 5353.66]  Like, it's just like, yeah, I'm Luke Skywalker.
[5353.84 --> 5355.62]  I'm, like, the savior of the galaxy.
[5356.20 --> 5360.06]  By the way, innocent creatures that really never did anything to hurt anybody.
[5360.76 --> 5361.24]  Boom!
[5362.12 --> 5363.84]  Like, like, not even...
[5363.84 --> 5368.18]  It's, like, not even, like, you know, hitting them nicely.
[5368.52 --> 5370.34]  It's, like, blowing them away.
[5371.84 --> 5372.70]  Which one do you do?
[5372.88 --> 5374.32]  You're supposed to go this way, I think.
[5375.56 --> 5376.30]  Oh, right.
[5376.30 --> 5378.84]  Yeah, I was just trying to make the jump, because old platformers suck.
[5380.20 --> 5381.04]  Blaster power-up!
[5381.44 --> 5381.88]  Oh, wow.
[5382.00 --> 5382.18]  Another?
[5382.46 --> 5382.66]  What?
[5383.70 --> 5385.52]  Yeah, because I need a homing blaster.
[5385.52 --> 5386.42]  Homing rockets.
[5387.54 --> 5387.94]  Okay.
[5388.86 --> 5390.98]  So, I guess it's, like, the game over.
[5391.12 --> 5393.04]  I was just going to say, you win now.
[5394.24 --> 5395.34]  That's cool, I guess.
[5395.72 --> 5397.78]  I don't have to hit anything from now on.
[5398.80 --> 5400.48]  Can you hold it, or do you have to keep that?
[5400.48 --> 5401.44]  Yeah, you can hold it.
[5401.56 --> 5402.00]  Wow.
[5405.84 --> 5406.64]  Oh, man.
[5410.84 --> 5413.04]  This is, like, aim- this is early aimbot.
[5416.40 --> 5418.24]  But actually, like, better than aimbot.
[5418.32 --> 5418.48]  Wow.
[5421.90 --> 5423.00]  That's awesome.
[5425.14 --> 5426.92]  Darth Vader, two times the point bonus.
[5428.18 --> 5429.20]  Because that makes sense.
[5429.46 --> 5430.74]  All these things make sense.
[5431.40 --> 5431.80]  Look at this.
[5431.92 --> 5434.50]  I can- I'm, like, destroying stuff I can't even see.
[5435.30 --> 5435.74]  No!
[5436.40 --> 5436.80]  Oh!
[5436.82 --> 5438.02]  All that progress.
[5438.22 --> 5438.34]  God.
[5438.64 --> 5438.88]  See?
[5439.18 --> 5439.60]  This.
[5439.88 --> 5440.22]  This.
[5440.44 --> 5441.42]  This is the problem.
[5443.64 --> 5444.66]  What the heck was that?
[5445.04 --> 5446.14]  I have no idea.
[5446.30 --> 5447.34]  Oh, wow.
[5447.44 --> 5449.52]  I have to go all the way back over here.
[5450.48 --> 5453.62]  Oh, that and the enemies just, like, infinitely respawn, apparently.
[5454.22 --> 5456.34]  So that's why they give you a home and pistol here.
[5457.12 --> 5457.52]  That's okay.
[5457.56 --> 5458.80]  I'll just hold it down from now on.
[5462.04 --> 5462.90]  I got this.
[5465.84 --> 5466.16]  Bladesaber!
[5466.74 --> 5467.40]  What happens?
[5468.14 --> 5468.82]  Health sword.
[5468.82 --> 5472.20]  Yeah, because that's what they're called.
[5473.02 --> 5474.02]  Oh, did it extend it?
[5474.98 --> 5478.62]  Yeah, it was a, uh, sword extension item.
[5479.46 --> 5482.44]  You know, I saw an ad for one of those in my email inbox once.
[5484.92 --> 5486.06]  A sword extension item?
[5486.38 --> 5487.44]  Did you?
[5488.30 --> 5488.82]  It's the...
[5489.82 --> 5492.00]  Oh, you can jump higher, like this.
[5492.00 --> 5496.16]  I just have to time this perfectly and then I think I can land on this thing.
[5496.96 --> 5498.08]  It doesn't come all the way down.
[5498.18 --> 5498.46]  I know.
[5499.14 --> 5500.10]  I saw him do it.
[5500.96 --> 5501.66]  Come on, Luke.
[5501.78 --> 5502.28]  Let's go.
[5502.66 --> 5503.04]  Other Luke.
[5503.18 --> 5503.44]  Not you.
[5504.96 --> 5506.24]  No, don't everyone go to EA.
[5506.36 --> 5509.24]  You won't pull it down because there won't be enough people because they actually have
[5509.24 --> 5511.88]  a pretty strong server hosting their website, not their games.
[5512.56 --> 5515.58]  Um, and you're just going to increase traffic to their website.
[5515.90 --> 5516.18]  Yeah.
[5516.34 --> 5516.82]  Don't do it.
[5517.14 --> 5517.60]  Don't do it.
[5517.60 --> 5517.84]  Don't go there.
[5518.42 --> 5519.16]  Don't go to EA.
[5519.42 --> 5519.74]  No.
[5519.74 --> 5524.96]  You're just making them, like, feel better about themselves, which they don't need.
[5525.10 --> 5526.06]  You shouldn't be doing that.
[5526.80 --> 5527.98]  Yeah, that's just wrong, actually.
[5527.98 --> 5528.52]  Twitch chat.
[5528.70 --> 5530.00]  Sniper 2 Ghost Warrior.
[5530.14 --> 5530.62]  What do you think?
[5531.30 --> 5532.22]  Sounds kind of cool.
[5532.54 --> 5533.34]  It sounds awesome.
[5533.44 --> 5537.48]  That's like they took every awesome, like, keyword and just put it in the title.
[5539.90 --> 5543.58]  Sniper, Ghost Warrior, and 2, which means there was, like, another one.
[5543.86 --> 5546.42]  So it justified making a sequel, so it must be good.
[5546.66 --> 5547.06]  Wow.
[5547.34 --> 5549.42]  No one has said it's good so far.
[5550.14 --> 5551.88]  There's a time limit for this game.
[5552.98 --> 5553.38]  Wow.
[5554.22 --> 5555.66]  Okay, I won't buy that game.
[5555.78 --> 5556.52]  Okay, thank you.
[5557.38 --> 5558.16]  What, is it terrible?
[5558.84 --> 5560.30]  Everyone has said it's bad.
[5560.68 --> 5562.88]  There wasn't a single person that said it's good yet.
[5564.32 --> 5564.72]  Ouch.
[5565.48 --> 5567.04]  Wow, apparently the first one was good.
[5567.52 --> 5568.70]  And this one's just horrible.
[5568.96 --> 5570.50]  So I was 100% right.
[5570.70 --> 5570.94]  Yeah.
[5571.18 --> 5572.52]  It's all about the keywords.
[5572.88 --> 5573.34]  Good call.
[5573.68 --> 5575.02]  I'm definitely getting Fez.
[5575.02 --> 5575.58]  Okay.
[5577.86 --> 5579.46]  So what, do I just have to guess here?
[5579.66 --> 5580.20]  Oh, no!
[5581.90 --> 5582.22]  Oh.
[5584.22 --> 5584.46]  Oh.
[5584.84 --> 5586.10]  I'm going to run out of time.
[5587.10 --> 5589.30]  This is, like, not an easy platformer.
[5589.54 --> 5590.48]  It's, like, the third level.
[5591.16 --> 5593.46]  And it's just completely unforgiving.
[5594.18 --> 5597.22]  It's like, yeah, if you can do it once, then you can do it four times.
[5597.44 --> 5598.16]  Don't worry about it.
[5598.30 --> 5598.44]  Yeah.
[5598.44 --> 5601.64]  So what do you have to guess?
[5602.56 --> 5603.98]  I can't see that platform.
[5605.12 --> 5605.84]  What platform?
[5606.02 --> 5607.54]  The one that I have to jump on after.
[5608.30 --> 5609.30]  I was looking away.
[5610.14 --> 5613.54]  No, no, it's, like, a while from now.
[5613.64 --> 5614.80]  I fell down pretty far.
[5615.32 --> 5616.46]  I knew I'd been going for a bit.
[5618.28 --> 5619.34]  Come on!
[5620.16 --> 5621.28]  Let's go, Luke.
[5621.70 --> 5622.50]  Not you.
[5622.68 --> 5623.00]  Him.
[5625.18 --> 5626.70]  Extend your health sword now!
[5628.44 --> 5629.48]  Health sword.
[5629.60 --> 5630.88]  What did you think I was talking about?
[5631.62 --> 5632.80]  Why are you gross?
[5634.30 --> 5635.32]  Okay, here we go.
[5635.68 --> 5637.32]  So I have to make this jump.
[5639.28 --> 5641.46]  Then I have to know where this thing is.
[5641.86 --> 5644.14]  Oh, I can look down with left.
[5645.52 --> 5647.10]  Because that makes sense.
[5648.20 --> 5655.90]  I, you know, would have guessed that as opposed to look left with left, which makes no sense.
[5655.90 --> 5656.98]  Oh, my goodness.
[5657.16 --> 5657.80]  That was close.
[5658.44 --> 5658.62]  Yeah.
[5659.10 --> 5659.88]  That was so close.
[5659.88 --> 5662.56]  And, like, my homing rockets are not really homing that long.
[5662.56 --> 5662.86]  Oh, no!
[5663.80 --> 5664.88]  Oh, you didn't go the whole...
[5664.88 --> 5665.68]  Oh, no!
[5665.80 --> 5666.32]  Oh, no!
[5669.06 --> 5670.24]  This game sucks.
[5672.88 --> 5674.48]  I still have 130...
[5674.48 --> 5675.92]  Wow, they're real seconds, too.
[5676.00 --> 5681.22]  It's not just, like, sort of video game seconds, where it's just, like, arbitrary random countdown timer seconds.
[5681.22 --> 5687.84]  They actually give you enough time in this level to fall down, like, four times.
[5688.38 --> 5690.96]  Because they hardcore expect you to do it, I guess.
[5691.66 --> 5692.24]  Oh, man.
[5692.32 --> 5699.90]  And the one dude that put that guy up there with the grenade or whatever he threw at you, you know that guy that put that character over there was just like, heh heh.
[5699.90 --> 5702.90]  I'm gonna ruin so many people's days.
[5704.82 --> 5705.78]  And he did.
[5705.78 --> 5719.78]  You know, if there's one thing about Xbox One that I really think, like, wasn't a big deal in terms of all the DRM and all the nonsense, it's game rentals.
[5719.78 --> 5723.20]  Why do game rentals still need to exist?
[5723.80 --> 5730.80]  Like, why are companies allowed to just, like, make money for, like, buying something and loaning it to people?
[5732.24 --> 5733.32]  I just think they're dumb.
[5733.64 --> 5735.16]  No one does it anymore anyways.
[5735.54 --> 5735.94]  Exactly!
[5736.12 --> 5736.78]  Like, who actually...
[5738.30 --> 5739.46]  Wow, that was close.
[5739.62 --> 5740.36]  Game fight, I guess.
[5743.06 --> 5744.56]  I am running out of time.
[5744.56 --> 5750.34]  I'm gonna be so disappointed if I reach the end and it's just like, no, sorry, you ran out of time.
[5750.58 --> 5750.86]  Oh!
[5751.18 --> 5751.66]  Oh!
[5751.80 --> 5752.20]  No!
[5752.88 --> 5753.04]  No!
[5754.72 --> 5755.16]  No!
[5755.62 --> 5756.28]  No, that's it.
[5756.32 --> 5757.74]  The only solution now is suicide.
[5759.94 --> 5760.38]  No!
[5761.56 --> 5762.22]  Kill me.
[5763.00 --> 5763.52]  Kill me now.
[5767.78 --> 5768.24]  Wow.
[5769.06 --> 5770.58]  Um, what did that guy do?
[5770.60 --> 5770.82]  Oh.
[5771.44 --> 5772.00]  Um.
[5772.18 --> 5772.62]  Okay.
[5773.82 --> 5774.26]  Okay.
[5774.56 --> 5775.56]  Man.
[5779.56 --> 5779.92]  Man.
[5780.62 --> 5782.24]  What if I stand right under the fire?
[5782.70 --> 5783.86]  What if I, like, jump at him?
[5785.12 --> 5785.52]  Really?
[5786.56 --> 5787.90]  Can he not hit you?
[5788.42 --> 5789.74]  I'm trying to help him.
[5789.80 --> 5791.16]  I'm trying to move up into his sight.
[5791.28 --> 5792.54]  Oh, there we go, there we go, there we go.
[5792.92 --> 5794.30]  It doesn't even do much damage.
[5799.80 --> 5801.18]  See, but if you die now...
[5801.18 --> 5802.08]  Aw, you're right.
[5803.34 --> 5803.74]  Aw.
[5803.74 --> 5805.24]  You're gonna lose your homing pistol.
[5806.52 --> 5808.16]  I know, but there'll be another one.
[5809.28 --> 5810.34]  This is so awesome.
[5811.62 --> 5813.68]  I'll just get, like, a pistol extension item.
[5813.84 --> 5815.48]  Okay, all the daily deals on Steam.
[5815.48 --> 5819.14]  Uh, chivalry is insane.
[5819.30 --> 5819.86]  I recommend...
[5819.86 --> 5822.40]  There's a lot of YouTube videos about chivalry.
[5823.04 --> 5823.58]  Um.
[5825.76 --> 5826.32]  It's...
[5826.32 --> 5826.86]  It's...
[5826.86 --> 5828.66]  It's pretty grotesque.
[5829.32 --> 5833.48]  If you run up to someone and chop them in half, like, you'll hear them very...
[5833.48 --> 5835.54]  You'll definitely hear them dying.
[5836.40 --> 5836.88]  And...
[5836.88 --> 5838.52]  You'll see all their guts fall out.
[5838.64 --> 5839.70]  And, like, it's quite graphical.
[5840.44 --> 5843.74]  Uh, Surgeon Simulator is more hilarious than anything as far as I can tell.
[5843.74 --> 5844.60]  Surgeon Simulator?
[5844.78 --> 5845.42]  Have you heard of it?
[5845.50 --> 5845.80]  No.
[5845.80 --> 5848.26]  It's super impossible to control your hands.
[5848.68 --> 5852.52]  So half the time you pick up, like, a scalpel and end up just, like, cutting someone completely open.
[5852.94 --> 5854.90]  But, like, not the way you're hoping to.
[5854.96 --> 5856.82]  Because you have to control each one of the person's hands.
[5857.32 --> 5860.54]  And, like, rotate them and make them grab and do everything.
[5861.24 --> 5863.66]  So, like, there's the world's fastest...
[5863.66 --> 5865.96]  I think it's brain transplant or something.
[5866.42 --> 5869.02]  And the guy starts it by grabbing a hammer.
[5869.66 --> 5873.08]  Like, whipping it across the screen and smashing the guy's head open.
[5873.32 --> 5874.16]  Grabbing the brain.
[5874.30 --> 5874.90]  Flipping it out.
[5875.08 --> 5877.42]  Grabbing a new one and shoving it and, like, tossing it in.
[5877.76 --> 5878.66]  And it's, like, complete.
[5880.94 --> 5881.76]  That's horrible.
[5882.06 --> 5883.38]  You know how there's all the, like, the...
[5883.38 --> 5885.36]  The, uh, Euro Truck Simulator and stuff?
[5885.48 --> 5887.66]  I think it's more of, like, making fun of that stuff.
[5887.66 --> 5893.46]  And there's funny ones where there's, like, a TF2 Heavy and you're the doctor from TF2.
[5894.28 --> 5894.54]  Okay.
[5894.92 --> 5896.02]  Like, it's...
[5896.02 --> 5896.62]  Yeah, I don't know.
[5896.88 --> 5898.78]  Surgeon Simulator, I think, would probably be pretty hilarious.
[5898.84 --> 5900.80]  Why do all those Sims get to exist?
[5901.30 --> 5902.82]  This one's, I think, more of a joke.
[5902.90 --> 5903.94]  Yeah, no, not this one.
[5904.00 --> 5904.94]  But, like, the other ones.
[5905.28 --> 5907.62]  The, like, the unironic Farm Simulator.
[5907.98 --> 5909.34]  The unironic Farm Simulator.
[5909.46 --> 5913.42]  And, you know, Euro Truck was on the Steam sale yesterday.
[5913.56 --> 5914.46]  I think it was the Daily Sale.
[5914.52 --> 5915.08]  I don't remember.
[5915.58 --> 5916.74]  And it was...
[5916.74 --> 5918.28]  Like, its sales were trending.
[5918.52 --> 5920.20]  It was in, like, the top ten or something.
[5921.12 --> 5921.82]  Like, do people just...
[5921.82 --> 5922.14]  Why?
[5923.10 --> 5925.38]  You drive a truck around Europe.
[5925.70 --> 5927.34]  And, like, not a sweet truck.
[5928.48 --> 5931.74]  Like, it's not a souped up awesome one and you're not racing people.
[5932.36 --> 5933.10]  Like, it's a semi.
[5934.40 --> 5934.66]  Oh.
[5934.66 --> 5941.72]  Like, is the entire target market for these games, like, people who, you know, don't want
[5941.72 --> 5944.98]  to encourage young people to, you know, street race?
[5946.12 --> 5948.06]  Like, is that what we're going for here?
[5948.16 --> 5949.80]  Because I don't get it at all.
[5950.26 --> 5950.78]  It's ridiculous.
[5951.22 --> 5952.54]  So we're going to say Euro Truck is fun.
[5952.54 --> 5953.58]  Why is it fun?
[5954.96 --> 5955.38]  Another guy.
[5955.46 --> 5956.20]  Euro Truck is awesome.
[5956.60 --> 5958.06]  Hey, I'm playing Euro Truck as we speak.
[5958.38 --> 5959.56]  Why are you all playing Euro Truck?
[5959.62 --> 5960.92]  Oh, my gosh.
[5961.78 --> 5964.86]  Apparently, when you run out of time, you don't run out of time.
[5964.86 --> 5968.20]  And I can't die on this level.
[5968.54 --> 5969.22]  Time Seeker.
[5969.60 --> 5970.24]  Is that...
[5970.24 --> 5970.52]  Oh, no.
[5970.58 --> 5971.98]  Seeker's your weapon, so time's your, your, your.
[5972.56 --> 5972.92]  Yeah.
[5973.94 --> 5974.62]  So I'm...
[5974.62 --> 5977.94]  Like, when I get to the end of the level, does it just tell me, no, you ran out of time.
[5978.00 --> 5978.60]  Don't worry about it, dude.
[5979.32 --> 5981.00]  Like, I don't get this at all.
[5982.84 --> 5984.12]  We should play some newer games.
[5984.64 --> 5984.96]  Yeah.
[5986.52 --> 5988.06]  Because old games are cool and all that.
[5990.62 --> 5991.88]  What newer game should we play?
[5992.76 --> 5993.36]  I don't know.
[5993.36 --> 5994.80]  We were talking about one today.
[5994.88 --> 5995.62]  I don't remember what...
[5995.62 --> 5995.90]  Trine.
[5996.50 --> 5996.82]  Oh, yeah.
[5996.86 --> 5997.66]  We should play some Trine.
[5998.08 --> 5999.74]  I'm actually, like, okay at Trine.
[5999.96 --> 6001.10]  Like, I know how to play it, so...
[6001.10 --> 6002.48]  I've never played, but...
[6002.48 --> 6003.10]  That's okay.
[6003.14 --> 6004.36]  You'll probably pick it up pretty quickly.
[6004.46 --> 6005.70]  I can play it, so...
[6005.70 --> 6006.18]  I'm...
[6006.18 --> 6009.86]  You've seen me try to play League of Legends, so that should tell you all you need to know.
[6012.38 --> 6013.22]  I mean, come on.
[6013.30 --> 6015.20]  For the audience's sake, it wasn't that bad, right?
[6019.66 --> 6021.04]  I wasn't that bad.
[6021.04 --> 6023.32]  Your problem in League was that you wouldn't listen.
[6024.02 --> 6026.12]  It wasn't that you were necessarily playing for League of Legends.
[6026.82 --> 6027.62]  I listened.
[6027.86 --> 6030.18]  I listened to my instincts.
[6030.52 --> 6031.26]  Yes, you did.
[6032.44 --> 6033.50]  Sometimes they were right.
[6033.62 --> 6035.90]  I was like, hey, we're fighting, and we'd be like...
[6035.90 --> 6037.18]  We'd be farming minions in lane.
[6037.56 --> 6038.96]  I'd be like, oh, hey, like...
[6038.96 --> 6042.14]  Multiple people on our team just came to gank our lane.
[6042.30 --> 6045.10]  And he'd be like, oh, and go stand by the tower.
[6045.10 --> 6045.60]  Sorry.
[6047.60 --> 6048.10]  Well...
[6048.10 --> 6048.98]  You just killed that thing.
[6049.36 --> 6049.70]  I don't know.
[6049.76 --> 6051.80]  The tower seemed helpful.
[6052.80 --> 6054.06]  But you were...
[6054.06 --> 6055.92]  The enemies weren't even on your screen.
[6059.04 --> 6061.08]  How do you know what was on my screen?
[6061.58 --> 6063.06]  Were you spying on me?
[6063.30 --> 6064.06]  Are you the NSA?
[6064.06 --> 6069.44]  Because if you were looking at your own character, which you should have been, then they weren't
[6069.44 --> 6070.36]  possibly a description.
[6072.58 --> 6075.54]  That might not necessarily be how my copy of League works.
[6075.54 --> 6079.10]  Wow.
[6080.10 --> 6080.98]  That's stage.
[6081.28 --> 6083.10]  So time is just for a bonus.
[6083.10 --> 6083.28]  It's a score bonus.
[6083.96 --> 6084.98]  Why would you...
[6084.98 --> 6087.62]  See, this drives me crazy.
[6087.76 --> 6088.18]  Here you go.
[6089.56 --> 6093.18]  Why do these kinds of games, where it's an objective-based game...
[6094.30 --> 6095.42]  Why do they need a score?
[6097.34 --> 6099.24]  Like, is this just to inflate my ego?
[6099.70 --> 6100.40]  If I can...
[6100.40 --> 6103.66]  Like, who actually plays a game like this over and over again to get a higher score?
[6103.66 --> 6105.96]  Even games like Angry Birds.
[6106.08 --> 6108.58]  Like, does someone actually care about three-starring everything?
[6108.72 --> 6109.22]  People do it.
[6109.26 --> 6109.80]  What is this?
[6110.40 --> 6110.80]  I don't know.
[6111.26 --> 6111.94]  How do I get it?
[6112.52 --> 6113.36]  Shills.
[6116.18 --> 6116.52]  Whoa.
[6118.02 --> 6119.76]  So now you have shields and a rocket pistol.
[6119.90 --> 6121.76]  Two things that don't exist in the movie.
[6123.56 --> 6125.24]  And a homing rocket pistol.
[6125.46 --> 6126.62]  A homing rocket pistol.
[6128.66 --> 6129.58]  Which arguably...
[6129.58 --> 6130.14]  What is this?
[6130.34 --> 6130.90]  Is this a weapon?
[6131.54 --> 6131.92]  Yeah.
[6132.22 --> 6132.88]  A blast drop grade.
[6133.66 --> 6134.40]  Let's find out what we have now.
[6134.70 --> 6135.66]  Oh, that's not even better, is it?
[6135.66 --> 6136.36]  Not homing.
[6136.90 --> 6137.30]  Whoa!
[6137.60 --> 6137.96]  Okay.
[6138.54 --> 6139.12]  Might be alright.
[6139.66 --> 6140.94]  No, it's ricochet?
[6143.84 --> 6144.88]  It's the rapid...
[6144.88 --> 6145.22]  Rapid ion.
[6145.78 --> 6146.58]  Rapid ion.
[6148.42 --> 6150.28]  Yeah, because that's how ion cannons work.
[6150.64 --> 6151.78]  They kill Jawas.
[6151.78 --> 6152.98]  Like, it just...
[6152.98 --> 6154.70]  It really seems like...
[6154.70 --> 6159.78]  You know, the guys in charge of Star Wars Universe stuff at times are just not in tune at all with...
[6160.86 --> 6161.72]  Star Wars Universe.
[6161.72 --> 6162.72]  Star Wars.
[6164.56 --> 6165.72]  This thing is nuts.
[6166.76 --> 6168.04]  I want the homing crystal, right?
[6168.22 --> 6169.14]  But this thing is nuts.
[6169.64 --> 6170.86]  I don't think you can downgrade.
[6171.48 --> 6173.20]  I remember that about this game, actually.
[6173.24 --> 6174.54]  I think I did play the Star Wars one.
[6175.38 --> 6178.90]  Maybe it was Star Wars and Jedi that I played and not Empire or something like that.
[6181.10 --> 6182.74]  It's a good thing you can't hit yourself, hey?
[6182.74 --> 6186.46]  This thing's ridiculous.
[6188.78 --> 6189.42]  It's okay.
[6189.56 --> 6189.92]  It's not holding.
[6189.92 --> 6190.82]  Oh, it's getting away from you.
[6191.32 --> 6192.04]  Yeah, you're done.
[6192.52 --> 6193.40]  Oh, okay.
[6193.76 --> 6194.72]  Good thing that was near the top.
[6195.84 --> 6196.36]  Get the heart.
[6196.52 --> 6196.86]  Get the heart.
[6197.10 --> 6198.08]  What was getting away from me?
[6198.16 --> 6198.72]  The platform.
[6199.84 --> 6200.08]  Oh.
[6200.34 --> 6200.54]  Oh.
[6200.78 --> 6201.08]  Oh.
[6201.28 --> 6201.52]  Oh.
[6201.68 --> 6201.88]  Oh.
[6202.06 --> 6202.46]  Oh.
[6202.66 --> 6202.82]  Oh.
[6202.82 --> 6203.14]  Okay.
[6203.14 --> 6205.72]  Hey, all right.
[6205.86 --> 6207.48]  My, uh...
[6207.48 --> 6208.42]  My Steam account.
[6208.74 --> 6210.06]  Did you manage to get yours or no?
[6210.12 --> 6211.30]  Oh, I can flippy jump.
[6212.10 --> 6213.14]  Okay, so I have...
[6213.14 --> 6213.92]  That jump is insane!
[6214.70 --> 6215.14]  Yeah, I know.
[6215.20 --> 6215.62]  It's way better.
[6216.78 --> 6217.28]  Oh, yeah.
[6217.30 --> 6218.24]  I forgot to tell you about that.
[6219.70 --> 6220.16]  Okay, whatever.
[6220.22 --> 6220.80]  Don't worry about the heart.
[6220.92 --> 6221.08]  Just...
[6221.08 --> 6221.50]  Oh.
[6221.78 --> 6222.14]  Oh.
[6222.14 --> 6222.34]  Oh.
[6222.34 --> 6226.92]  I think you can tell from the spinning spikes that down there is bad.
[6227.68 --> 6229.12]  I didn't mean to fall down there.
[6229.46 --> 6230.40]  That was not intentional.
[6230.62 --> 6231.36]  That looked intentional.
[6231.94 --> 6232.30]  Ah!
[6233.84 --> 6236.14]  This is a really hard platformer, actually.
[6236.46 --> 6236.68]  Wow.
[6236.98 --> 6238.36]  I don't like the jump arc.
[6239.80 --> 6240.88]  What the hell?
[6242.56 --> 6243.66]  May I ask what you're doing?
[6244.14 --> 6246.44]  I keep on thinking that it's going to go further.
[6246.82 --> 6248.02]  Because it looks...
[6248.02 --> 6248.34]  Oh.
[6249.38 --> 6252.32]  It looks like it's going to go further, but then it just totally doesn't.
[6253.34 --> 6254.10]  You have a shield.
[6254.20 --> 6255.18]  It takes forever to kill these things.
[6255.18 --> 6255.82]  How do you use your shield?
[6256.06 --> 6257.06]  I have no idea.
[6259.18 --> 6259.54]  Okay.
[6260.18 --> 6265.62]  So, I have spent 1,276.6 hours playing my games.
[6266.42 --> 6274.10]  I have 123 items valued at $1,929.94, and it requires 660 gigabytes.
[6274.82 --> 6276.96]  The problem with this calculation is that...
[6276.96 --> 6277.12]  What?
[6278.42 --> 6281.48]  I was standing there shooting the thing in a random jet of fire.
[6281.48 --> 6286.98]  I had been there for a really long time, and this random jet of fire just comes out and
[6286.98 --> 6287.40]  kills me.
[6287.64 --> 6288.54]  And you're back on blast.
[6289.22 --> 6289.66]  No!
[6291.04 --> 6291.84]  That's brutal.
[6293.92 --> 6295.04]  Oh, wow.
[6295.56 --> 6297.12]  Way to go, Slick.
[6297.12 --> 6301.44]  Well, at least I got a health sword.
[6304.00 --> 6305.20]  Since when do they lay down?
[6306.40 --> 6309.02]  When you let them stay around long enough, then they'll do it.
[6311.22 --> 6311.58]  Wow.
[6311.78 --> 6313.52]  I am so disappointed.
[6313.52 --> 6318.22]  I love how blasters open doors, because...
[6318.22 --> 6318.42]  Yeah.
[6319.60 --> 6319.96]  Oh!
[6320.08 --> 6321.38]  Now I have to have this one.
[6321.60 --> 6322.46]  That one's pretty...
[6322.46 --> 6323.72]  I want my rocket pistol!
[6324.00 --> 6325.38]  Wait, does that mean rocket pistol's next?
[6325.42 --> 6325.74]  Yes.
[6326.10 --> 6326.34]  Okay.
[6326.74 --> 6329.28]  But we didn't find another blaster power-up.
[6329.40 --> 6329.52]  Nope.
[6329.68 --> 6330.02]  So...
[6330.02 --> 6331.02]  Nope.
[6331.02 --> 6331.52]  So...
[6331.52 --> 6333.10]  Okay.
[6334.32 --> 6336.52]  It's like endless battle of ultimate...
[6337.32 --> 6337.78]  Dirt.
[6337.78 --> 6338.34]  Yeah.
[6339.68 --> 6340.64]  Health sword.
[6344.38 --> 6345.64]  Guess who shot first?
[6345.92 --> 6346.76]  Me, suckas.
[6349.02 --> 6350.58]  Han totally shot first.
[6351.74 --> 6353.48]  We've had this conversation, right?
[6353.96 --> 6354.20]  Nope.
[6354.92 --> 6355.30]  What?
[6355.68 --> 6355.94]  Nope.
[6356.58 --> 6357.14]  Oh.
[6357.70 --> 6358.46]  I don't know.
[6358.46 --> 6363.32]  I just think it's stupid that they remastered it to make Han seem like a nicer dude.
[6363.90 --> 6365.60]  Han is a space badass.
[6365.60 --> 6368.98]  And he shot first, because Greedo is a sucker.
[6371.50 --> 6373.36]  Because that is how Han rolls.
[6373.46 --> 6373.62]  See?
[6374.26 --> 6376.62]  Same as that, but that one never shot at me.
[6379.80 --> 6382.54]  Well, at least I can handle going on the platform, so that's good.
[6382.66 --> 6383.88]  I handled it the second time.
[6384.18 --> 6384.22]  Hmm.
[6384.48 --> 6385.70]  For this one, I never missed.
[6388.04 --> 6389.00]  Okay, that was close.
[6389.24 --> 6389.62]  Yeah.
[6390.96 --> 6391.68]  Whatever, man.
[6393.42 --> 6393.86]  Wow!
[6394.14 --> 6394.50]  Yeah!
[6394.74 --> 6395.54]  That's right!
[6395.90 --> 6396.46]  That's right!
[6401.10 --> 6402.32]  I got these platforms.
[6402.48 --> 6403.04]  They got nothing.
[6403.18 --> 6404.10]  Oh, wow!
[6404.20 --> 6405.36]  How many of these are there?
[6405.78 --> 6407.88]  At what point in the movie do these show up?
[6408.50 --> 6409.94]  I went through quite a few.
[6410.62 --> 6410.96]  Oh!
[6411.38 --> 6413.36]  You've had so many close jumps.
[6414.02 --> 6414.28]  Whoa!
[6414.44 --> 6415.56]  That is the mark of it.
[6415.64 --> 6416.04]  Oh!
[6417.04 --> 6417.36]  Oh!
[6417.42 --> 6417.64]  Oh!
[6417.64 --> 6417.96]  Oh!
[6418.04 --> 6418.82]  Right at the end.
[6419.34 --> 6419.74]  Whoa, what?
[6420.26 --> 6420.68]  Secretariat?
[6420.98 --> 6421.34]  Oh!
[6421.58 --> 6422.42]  Oh, too late.
[6422.42 --> 6422.92]  Okay.
[6424.18 --> 6428.12]  Okay, and since when are these robots, like, supreme badasses?
[6429.44 --> 6429.80]  Okay.
[6433.80 --> 6434.12]  Okay.
[6434.12 --> 6438.18]  The details are so not well defined that you can't tell where all this stuff is.
[6439.90 --> 6442.00]  Probably doesn't help that it's really far away either.
[6442.10 --> 6442.96]  Okay, so how do I get past...
[6442.96 --> 6443.54]  Oh, I get it.
[6444.24 --> 6444.86]  Oh, come on.
[6447.12 --> 6447.48]  Really?
[6447.48 --> 6450.40]  Okay, so when does it turn on?
[6452.38 --> 6453.12]  Oh, come on.
[6454.44 --> 6457.16]  You probably have to, like, take out the power source or something.
[6458.00 --> 6459.48]  Or, like, some stupid, like...
[6461.32 --> 6464.88]  Come on!
[6466.42 --> 6468.12]  I'm not gonna get my time bonus.
[6468.12 --> 6471.84]  How do you use your shields?
[6473.56 --> 6474.16]  I don't know.
[6484.56 --> 6485.94]  Where's my blaster power-up?
[6487.00 --> 6488.16]  I want my rocket pistol.
[6491.76 --> 6492.98]  That's actually a pretty good game.
[6493.34 --> 6494.84]  Faster Than Light is an awesome game.
[6495.08 --> 6495.62]  Oh, man.
[6495.66 --> 6496.98]  We should definitely do Faster Than Light.
[6496.98 --> 6498.34]  Sure.
[6500.34 --> 6501.18]  Shouldn't take very long.
[6501.18 --> 6502.74]  You saw me playing that before, haven't you?
[6503.36 --> 6504.04]  I don't know.
[6504.32 --> 6504.68]  I don't remember.
[6505.02 --> 6508.30]  Between runs for Titan.
[6508.54 --> 6509.32]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[6509.34 --> 6509.64]  That one.
[6509.76 --> 6509.96]  Yeah.
[6510.18 --> 6511.52]  It's, like, space and stuff, right?
[6511.64 --> 6511.78]  Yeah.
[6518.24 --> 6519.82]  Where does the platform go?
[6521.82 --> 6524.00]  In that situation, where does the platform go?
[6524.02 --> 6525.14]  I don't know where it went.
[6526.04 --> 6526.44]  Oh!
[6526.98 --> 6527.48]  Oh, no.
[6527.48 --> 6527.60]  All right.
[6527.74 --> 6530.62]  Well, it's 8.30, so we should probably call it quits for today anyway.
[6530.72 --> 6531.36]  I'm cool with that.
[6533.94 --> 6536.94]  Thank you, everyone, for tuning in to the livestream after party.
[6537.40 --> 6540.60]  Thanks for watching the first episode of the WAN show?
[6540.76 --> 6542.24]  The first episode of the WAN show?
[6542.34 --> 6543.78]  Well, right, the WAN show after party.
[6544.36 --> 6545.58]  Not livestream after party.
[6546.18 --> 6547.34]  We'll get this right at some point.
[6548.02 --> 6548.54]  Good night, everyone.
[6548.94 --> 6549.58]  Good night, everyone.
[6550.20 --> 6550.28]  Good night.
[6550.64 --> 6551.54]  Good night.
[6551.54 --> 6551.96]  Good day.
[6552.08 --> 6568.42]  Good night.
[6568.46 --> 6573.08]  Good night.
[6573.08 --> 6575.18]  Good night.
