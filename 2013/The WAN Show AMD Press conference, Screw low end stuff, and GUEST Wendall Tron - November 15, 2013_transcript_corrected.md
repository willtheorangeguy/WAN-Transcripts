[0.00 → 7.00] Welcome to the WAN show guys! We would like to apologize for the incredible slowness with which we got the show going today.
[7.00 → 12.00] We had a number of issues. First and foremost was the fact that our... where is that thing?
[12.00 → 14.00] Because I think we should just destroy it on camera.
[14.00 → 24.00] Okay, so our Behringer headphones, splitter and amplifier has gone further than having one dead port and has now failed outright and is causing all kinds of random interference.
[24.00 → 27.00] So this thing can die in a fire.
[27.00 → 42.00] Then my display port output on my other notebook, you can see I'm not using my notebook this week, decided that it did not want to be imported by the Aver Media capture card nor the Black magic extra backup capture card that we have on our stream PC.
[42.00 → 46.00] So I had to run and find another notebook to use.
[46.00 → 54.00] So between those two issues we've had to redo our audio setup, we've had to change over my notebook and I believe we actually redid the networking in this room while we were at it.
[54.00 → 59.00] And we did all that in half an hour. So as much as we're very sorry for being late, we do sincerely apologize.
[59.00 → 63.00] We hope that you're at least a little bit impressed that we managed to bring the show to you at all today.
[63.00 → 68.00] So guys, without further ado, welcome to the WAN show.
[68.00 → 73.00] Our topics today... oh, first, our special guest is Wendell from Tech Syndicate by popular demand.
[73.00 → 83.00] We're actually going to be bringing him on pretty much right away because we're starting late, and we're going to have a ton of discussion about AMD's event that just ran this week.
[83.00 → 100.00] There's lots of new stuff about Mantle, AMD's upcoming Kaveri Apus in January, as well as, I mean, just cool software stuff like Tress FX 2.0, which is apparently going to do more than make a ponytail waggle back and forth realistically most of the time.
[100.00 → 103.00] We've also got lots of console stuff to talk about.
[103.00 → 115.00] So one of them of the many console topics is the PS4 streaming to Vita compared to Nvidia streaming from a PC to Nvidia Shield, which I think is actually pretty interesting.
[115.00 → 123.00] Yeah, we actually got a PS4 today, so we are definitely going to be doing some high speed footage comparing the latency of Shield to the latency of PS4's Vita.
[123.00 → 124.00] I guess we'll have to get a Vita.
[124.00 → 125.00] We'll have to get a Vita.
[125.00 → 126.00] Oh, balls.
[126.00 → 127.00] Okay, well, we'll have to do that.
[127.00 → 128.00] Okay, anyway.
[128.00 → 129.00] You can probably get a used Vita.
[129.00 → 131.00] Without further ado, here's the intro.
[131.00 → 132.00] ok.
[132.00 → 156.00] It's so exciting, let's do we have to get started?
[156.00 → 177.58] So guys, our sponsor for the WAN show this week is Hotspot Shield. Hotspot Shield is an easy VPN solution and there are actually a couple misconceptions about it. So people think that it is ad supported. No, if you buy the Elite version, and you use offer code Linus, you save 20%, and it is not ad supported if you're using Elite.
[177.58 → 199.22] So VPNs allow you to mask your location and identity from casual browsers. I mean, if the NSA is real determined to figure out who you are, they probably can. But it also allows you to circumvent geographical restrictions on services such as Netflix or even Google services in countries where they're not allowed to be used. So it's, uh, yeah, I mean, I just said everything it does, right?
[199.22 → 221.42] Essentially. All right. So without further ado, guys, let's launch into our first topic before we have Wendell join us. So Kaveri is AMD's upcoming APU architecture. So it's going to be changing over from the previous generation cores to, I believe, oh, bollocks. What's the new one called? Is it steamroller or?
[221.42 → 249.88] No, I think it's steamroller. So they're going to be changing over to steamroller cores, which is going to amount to essentially improved performance in single threaded applications, which lets face it, guys, AMD has been due to deliver us for a while here. We've been looking at pretty much for a from a per-clock basis. Um, not a lot of improvement in the last few generations of AMD processors.
[249.88 → 264.14] They've done things like adding more cores, and they've done things like increasing clock speeds, but the actual IPC hasn't changed a lot. So we're going to see a dramatic improvement there. The other thing that we're going to see improved is multithreaded performance.
[264.46 → 279.04] So this is going to be augmented by certain software things that are going to be changing over the next little while, particularly for gamers with Mantle. But Kaveri is going to improve single threaded performance, multithreaded performance, and dramatically improve GPU performance.
[279.04 → 284.08] So this was a tweet from Ryan Shout, who I've actually arranged to join us next week. I don't know if you knew this yet.
[284.20 → 284.30] Cool.
[284.50 → 290.48] So Ryan's going to be joining us next week. He was at the event. We unfortunately weren't able to attend, but this tweet, he says,
[290.58 → 302.38] just saw AMD Kaveri running Battlefield 4 at 1080p medium settings, beating the Intel 4770K and GeForce GT 630 GPU. Impressive.
[302.38 → 312.02] Especially impressive when you consider that Kaveri CPU, APU, GPU, whatever you want to call it, that Kaveri APU is probably going to be significantly less expensive than that other solution.
[312.12 → 323.62] Now, I suspect that AMD was picking and choosing the comparison a little carefully there, because the 4770K costs $100 more than a 4670K and doesn't tangibly improve the gaming performance in most games.
[323.62 → 327.70] Whereas spending that extra $100 on a GPU is kind of a thing.
[327.90 → 328.44] But in Battlefield 4, maybe.
[328.84 → 333.76] But in Battlefield 4, maybe. But I think we can still agree that spending another $100 on a GPU is going to be a bigger difference.
[333.98 → 334.92] A bigger difference.
[335.16 → 340.22] We actually just did some testing recently that maybe you'd like to talk about a little bit.
[340.22 → 342.82] So, we normally don't review low-end stuff.
[343.24 → 347.06] And we normally don't review stuff that we think is stupid.
[347.30 → 351.12] Because what's the point of us giving exposure to products that we think are stupid?
[351.48 → 358.78] But recently, just to kind of, you know, fly in the face of everyone saying how we're this, and we're that, and we don't do these things, I decided to do it.
[358.82 → 362.86] We grabbed an R7 240 graphics cards, which is an $80 card.
[362.94 → 364.68] Very value-oriented. Or is it?
[364.98 → 365.30] No.
[366.58 → 366.86] No.
[367.00 → 368.18] Really? That's all you're going to say about it?
[368.18 → 377.72] If you put down the rebate and actually do it, unlike many people happen to do, and decide to get a 7770.
[377.78 → 378.16] Yeah, stop.
[379.08 → 380.20] So many sevens.
[380.50 → 384.92] A 7770, you pay the rebate, it's basically the same price and is incredibly better.
[385.32 → 393.62] And if you decide to get a you want a new generation one, if you shelve out a little bit more and get a 260X, it's way, way, way, way, way better.
[393.62 → 400.60] Right. So, basically, Linus wanted to torture me and have me test a R7 240, which was torture.
[400.74 → 403.92] Yeah, what was benchmarking like at nine frames per second? I'm just curious.
[403.92 → 419.74] I had to run the Far Cry benchmark way more than I normally run it, because if you guys have seen the Far Cry benchmarking video, you know I go around that loop and I kind of bend around the corners and try to get up and hit those barrels and whatever, and I have to be hitting the barrels and I try to dodge guys.
[419.98 → 421.78] And rockets. I have to dodge rockets.
[421.84 → 422.56] Dodge all the rockets.
[422.56 → 425.66] If I get hit by a rocket, I have to restart because it changes the frame rate too much.
[426.46 → 430.72] So, I was constantly getting hit by rockets because I couldn't dodge them because I can't move properly.
[431.04 → 438.20] And I was constantly like just skimming barrels, not hitting them and just being like, ah, well, I need that time increase, so I kind of need to restart.
[438.92 → 440.44] It's just like, come on.
[440.44 → 446.58] Or I'd hit an angle around a corner, just kind of weird and hit something, and it would stop the car, and I'd just be like, okay.
[447.60 → 448.62] I'd have to start again.
[448.70 → 457.06] So, basically, guys, what we're trying to say here is if you really want a value-optimized graphics solution, check out Apus.
[457.14 → 460.08] We actually have a build guide that we're going to be working on very, very soon.
[460.16 → 465.46] We're going to be bringing that to you guys where we're going to do kind of like a $500 to $600 APU system.
[465.46 → 474.40] So, it's going to be optimized for using OpenCL to accelerate certain workloads such as Adobe Photoshop, some of the filters you can apply are OpenCL accelerated.
[474.82 → 477.90] It'll also be focused on the degradability of an APU.
[477.98 → 492.66] So, you can have entry-level gaming today, then you can pop a $150, $100 graphics card in it, and you can have a truly excellent gaming experience that's as good or better than what you can get with a game console for really not that much more expensive, especially when you consider the additional functionality.
[492.66 → 495.46] So, I am an advocate of APU.
[495.62 → 504.72] I'm an advocate of graphics cards that are about $100 and up, but that low-end graphics card market, whether it's AMD or NVIDIA, we're not meaning to pick on AMD with the R7 240.
[505.66 → 507.10] They just, they came up.
[507.66 → 507.84] Yeah.
[507.98 → 508.72] Their number was up.
[508.82 → 511.40] So, I mean, there are other AMD solutions that we like.
[511.94 → 513.06] So, I would say...
[513.06 → 516.66] Yeah, and like you just said, something like a 630 probably...
[517.14 → 517.86] Equally stupid.
[518.04 → 518.20] Yeah.
[518.20 → 518.46] Yeah.
[518.56 → 522.70] So, the thing is, upgrade your entire system if you have $80 to spend.
[522.80 → 524.66] Grab a cheap APU and a motherboard.
[525.66 → 527.38] And that's, and sell your old stuff.
[527.46 → 528.34] Get a couple bucks there.
[528.40 → 530.36] Maybe you can get 20 bucks for it if it's ancient.
[530.48 → 534.02] That gives you an extra little bit to maybe grab, you know, a little bit of RAM.
[534.20 → 537.26] Or you can get 4GB RAM kits, I think, for like 25 bucks these days.
[537.64 → 539.98] I was looking at them online the other day.
[540.24 → 540.60] Oh, okay.
[540.64 → 542.48] Because I was going to say with the RAM shortage, I wasn't sure.
[542.60 → 542.70] Yeah.
[542.70 → 543.92] So, I mean, yeah.
[544.06 → 547.76] Upgrade your system, get reasonable performance, and then upgrade a little bit again later.
[548.08 → 548.44] All right.
[548.48 → 554.12] So, without further ado, let's invite our special guest, Wendell from Tech Syndicate by popular demand.
[555.24 → 556.44] Why, hello there, sir.
[556.54 → 561.10] You might not be able to hear me yet, but you might be able to hear me now because he was just doing the things.
[564.10 → 565.18] Hopefully, he's there.
[565.84 → 565.98] Yep.
[565.98 → 566.42] Yes.
[567.60 → 569.22] You left us in suspense there.
[569.34 → 574.60] We've redone the audio setup, which means that we really just don't know what's going to work and what's not.
[575.14 → 575.78] Hey, man.
[575.82 → 576.28] How are you?
[578.20 → 579.90] Yeah, I've had better days.
[579.98 → 580.78] Thank you for asking.
[586.34 → 586.70] Yeah.
[588.08 → 590.14] So, oh, oh, what?
[590.38 → 592.06] Whoa, people are saying they can't hear Wendell.
[592.14 → 592.60] Okay, okay.
[592.66 → 593.72] Give us just a moment here.
[594.32 → 595.44] We got to...
[595.44 → 595.62] Hmm?
[595.98 → 597.82] Why?
[599.22 → 600.10] Uh...
[600.10 → 602.16] Hold on.
[603.18 → 605.48] It's on this one, isn't it?
[605.80 → 606.50] I have no idea.
[606.64 → 606.86] Yeah.
[607.46 → 609.22] Oh, I don't remember how to fix that.
[609.92 → 610.30] Okay.
[611.40 → 612.66] Wendell, give us a moment.
[613.22 → 616.22] We might have a bit of a TeamSpeak configuration thing going on here.
[616.22 → 626.46] Oh, it's like, you know, the NSA, who, of course, is probably a big fan of you, just doesn't want this show to happen.
[626.46 → 630.92] So they, like, you know, hacked our stream PC or something.
[630.92 → 631.56] Oh, my God.
[631.56 → 631.78] Something.
[632.58 → 632.86] Stop.
[633.42 → 635.86] Conspiracy theories abound here.
[635.86 → 638.04] So they don't want this stream to happen.
[638.04 → 641.40] So they came into our house with, you know...
[641.40 → 642.76] Oh, actually, Wendell, can you talk for a minute?
[642.86 → 643.82] Let's see if they can hear you now.
[644.70 → 645.42] Ode to spot.
[645.62 → 646.26] They can hear.
[646.26 → 647.82] Feels canis is your taxonomic nomenclature.
[647.82 → 648.30] Okay.
[649.88 → 650.84] All right.
[650.96 → 652.48] Welcome to the show, man.
[652.58 → 660.26] Now, we've only met in person once before, but I think we had a fair bit of fun going to that restaurant that Logan couldn't eat anything at.
[662.94 → 663.34] And...
[663.34 → 664.58] That was kind of fun.
[664.88 → 666.18] That was kind of fun.
[666.26 → 672.42] So why don't you just take a brief moment and introduce yourself to those few of our viewers who don't already know who you are.
[674.10 → 674.54] I'm...
[674.54 → 675.10] Hey, guys.
[675.16 → 675.62] I'm Wendell.
[675.62 → 683.96] I'm on loan from Tech Syndicate, and I sort of take care of the forum a little bit over there and some of the technical things, and I do a little bit of everything.
[684.26 → 686.64] So I sort of...
[686.64 → 689.52] I'm sort of the nerd that nerds out with Logan, I guess.
[690.88 → 691.40] All right.
[691.44 → 698.96] So speaking of needing out, why don't we just go ahead and jump right into our first guest topic here, which is a little bit out of order.
[699.14 → 703.90] But this was a post on Intel's Facebook not that long ago.
[703.90 → 707.12] I'm sort of the nerd that nerds out with Logan, I guess.
[707.12 → 708.46] So Intel says...
[708.46 → 709.04] All right.
[709.08 → 715.46] So speaking of needing out, why don't we just go ahead and jump right into our first guest topic here, which is a little bit out of order.
[715.46 → 721.52] Which is a little bit out of order, but this was a post on Intel's Facebook not that long ago.
[721.52 → 723.52] So they've got crap on here that's like, look at this.
[723.52 → 724.58] It's a recipe match.
[724.74 → 726.92] It's like pointing at stuff and giving you a little recipe.
[727.06 → 735.30] I mean, this is a very first world problem, having so much variety in the food that we can choose to eat that we need a computer to tell us what to eat and when and how.
[735.76 → 740.12] But tell me about this concept and how Intel might not have been the first one to think of this.
[740.12 → 750.72] Oh, well, I think what you're talking about is in college, I built something similar, but it was a little different.
[751.26 → 751.44] Okay.
[751.52 → 756.02] So the Intel thing is they've got the fridge and, you know, the fridge knows what's inside it and blah, blah, blah.
[756.04 → 756.82] I didn't really do that.
[758.40 → 760.76] Well, why don't you tell us what you did have running?
[760.84 → 762.70] Because it sounded pretty cool when you were telling me about it.
[762.70 → 770.62] I've got – so what I did was, you know, it's very much foul bachelor frog, if you can imagine foul bachelor frog.
[770.72 → 773.64] So a lot of frozen dinners were sort of, you know, in my future.
[773.78 → 777.00] But I had a barcode scanner hooked up to a microwave oven.
[777.56 → 782.36] And so I could take something out of the freezer and scan it with the barcode scanner and put it in the oven.
[782.36 → 785.64] But, you know, a frozen dinner in a microwave oven, that never comes out well.
[785.72 → 787.62] So I got one of the fancy ovens with the turntable.
[787.74 → 792.62] And so it's like, you know, running high for five minutes and then sleep for two minutes and then spin it the other way for a minute and a half.
[793.00 → 795.88] I got kind of fancy with the programs for the programmable microwave.
[796.30 → 797.20] So that was kind of fun.
[797.50 → 800.48] But, you know, fresh vegetables, there's no barcode, so it didn't work.
[802.92 → 812.90] So basically what you had managed to build was something that would have terrible implications for the health of anyone that used it.
[812.90 → 815.16] Because no one would ever eat vegetables anymore.
[815.84 → 817.14] Only things with barcodes.
[817.14 → 824.00] Yeah, you would have to prepare your meals ahead of time, I guess, for like the way that...
[824.00 → 825.38] But it was, you know, a minimum of effort.
[825.48 → 826.18] I mean, how cool is that?
[826.22 → 830.38] You can just pop open the fridge, scan it, put it in the thing, and then when it beeps, it's done.
[831.44 → 832.94] It's actually pretty freaking cool.
[833.74 → 839.50] And like, yeah, it would be pretty funny if you got like a homemade barcode creator thing.
[839.50 → 842.56] Just like individually barcoded all of your different vegetables.
[842.78 → 848.24] Well, I even actually, like I thought of that because one of the things that I wanted to do as an inventory system here,
[848.30 → 854.00] I talked to you about this very briefly, because we get a lot of like random graphics cards and stuff arriving.
[854.16 → 856.46] Some of it has to go back, some of it doesn't have to go back.
[856.46 → 861.26] It's hard to keep track of what anything is or how much it's worth or what we're supposed to do with it.
[861.60 → 866.28] So I was like, okay, well, we should just have like a tablet with a barcode scanner like at the door.
[866.38 → 871.26] And then when stuff arrives, we could just scan it into inventory, put in an approximate value from the invoice,
[871.32 → 873.30] and then at least we can track things.
[873.80 → 877.40] But this Intel thing looks much more sophisticated.
[877.72 → 881.76] And I think there are a few different ways that this could improve our lives.
[881.82 → 885.28] So number one that comes to mind immediately, of course, is the recipe match.
[885.28 → 887.64] Number two is replenishment.
[888.20 → 895.16] So with Amazon rolling out things like grocery delivery, you could just basically have, you know,
[895.22 → 901.56] it could be like Google now, not only tracks when you need to go to work and how to get there and how long it's going to take,
[901.68 → 908.14] but tracks what you might be in the mood to eat based on your, you know, circadian rhythms or whatever, the season.
[908.52 → 910.02] And, you know, hey, it's October.
[910.24 → 911.66] Would you like some pumpkin pie?
[911.66 → 911.78] Okay.
[912.16 → 915.78] And, you know, it'll just order from Amazon what you might like to eat.
[915.90 → 918.14] You can obviously manually override it if you want.
[918.36 → 919.54] And then it just shows up.
[919.60 → 920.26] You put it in your fridge.
[920.30 → 921.28] Your fridge tells you what to cook.
[921.34 → 923.76] I mean, are we going to get to the point where we don't even have to think anymore?
[923.76 → 934.24] It would probably work pretty well from a nutrition and diet management standpoint because I knew somebody that lived in Seattle when they had the home grocery delivery service.
[934.46 → 935.22] And that was amazing.
[935.34 → 938.66] Like that was like I stayed with them for a month or so while I was out there.
[939.18 → 941.96] And it was the most incredible thing ever.
[942.04 → 945.90] I mean, you get weekly fresh groceries, fresh vegetables all delivered right to your door.
[945.90 → 951.90] And it's like, wow, if you combine that with, you know, nutrition management and something else, and it's all handled by an application, you don't have to think anymore.
[952.90 → 953.86] Which, you know what?
[953.96 → 957.18] I mean, when we say that, it sounds like kind of a dirty word.
[957.28 → 958.48] You know, you don't have to think anymore.
[958.52 → 966.22] Like I've criticized Luke here for not being able to find his way to work after working there for well over six months.
[967.08 → 969.30] But I bussed there the whole time.
[969.38 → 969.68] Sometimes.
[970.16 → 970.42] Because.
[970.76 → 971.76] I barely ever drove there.
[971.76 → 974.50] You were driving for a while, and you still didn't know how to get there.
[974.56 → 974.76] A month.
[974.96 → 976.44] Which was like four times.
[976.60 → 976.90] Whatever.
[977.34 → 979.10] So what do you, there's like four turns, okay?
[979.32 → 983.48] So what he would do is he would just key it into Google Maps, and then he would follow it.
[983.72 → 984.80] And then he wouldn't think.
[985.16 → 987.06] And in this, like I kind of would tease him.
[987.16 → 987.74] I'd go, well, you know.
[987.74 → 988.74] He did traffic routing.
[988.90 → 990.50] It would give me a different route every time based on traffic.
[990.50 → 995.02] So old guys like me had to listen to the radio and had to actually know how to get places.
[995.02 → 1004.50] Whereas I had a conversation with someone who disagreed with me very strongly that at some point kids aren't even going to know how to drive or how to get anywhere because it'll always be done for them.
[1004.78 → 1008.62] But nutrition is something where I really don't think there's anything wrong.
[1008.80 → 1009.74] It's like phone numbers.
[1009.84 → 1012.32] It's like what is the benefit of storing phone numbers in your head?
[1012.88 → 1016.30] Other than 911, I don't think we really need phone numbers in our heads.
[1016.30 → 1016.82] Well, if your phone dies or something.
[1017.02 → 1018.38] Yeah, or if your phone dies or something.
[1018.52 → 1018.96] But even then.
[1018.96 → 1022.26] But I have like two or three that if I'm ever in trouble, it would be fine.
[1022.38 → 1023.40] I don't need to know all of them.
[1023.40 → 1028.20] But nutrition is something that is so essential and is so complicated that people and people don't really understand.
[1028.48 → 1033.58] Like you'd be able to do things like your smart fridge could detect on Facebook that you said you're going to have a baby.
[1033.80 → 1040.02] And all of a sudden it could take papaya out of your regular shipments because pregnant women shouldn't eat papaya, which is a totally unintuitive thing.
[1040.60 → 1041.32] How cool is that?
[1043.52 → 1044.56] I like that a lot.
[1044.56 → 1046.16] I mean, smart applications.
[1046.30 → 1047.96] I think there's a lot to the future in that.
[1048.34 → 1052.18] I knew one of the guys that worked on the residential version of the Turbo Chef.
[1052.18 → 1056.62] And that it's been out for many years now, probably four or five years.
[1056.78 → 1059.30] But there's an app that's built into the home Turbo Chef.
[1059.38 → 1061.20] This is like a $5,000 home oven.
[1061.62 → 1063.34] But it can cook things immediately.
[1063.54 → 1070.24] And it makes it really easy to cook things like chicken and duck and lamb and things like that without having to do a lot of preparation with fresh ingredients.
[1070.24 → 1075.30] And I could see sort of the technology there with this oven combined with something like this fridge.
[1075.40 → 1078.08] I mean, it's a fascinating technology.
[1078.08 → 1083.04] And you end up, you know, sort of having a better life experience because, you know, you're doing good home cooking and things like that.
[1083.08 → 1084.52] It will improve the quality of life.
[1084.88 → 1085.56] And you know what?
[1085.58 → 1086.54] I don't mind cooking.
[1086.54 → 1092.96] I find one of the most crappy things about home cooked meals is coming up with what you want to eat.
[1093.40 → 1094.92] And then shopping for it.
[1095.00 → 1101.26] And then all of a sudden we've taken the tediousness, tedium I guess would be the correct word, out of that.
[1101.38 → 1104.82] And all you have to do is prepare food, which really isn't even that time-consuming.
[1105.00 → 1108.14] And it's so much less expensive and so much better for you.
[1108.14 → 1111.24] It would just be an automatic improvement for me because I just go to Costco.
[1111.72 → 1112.98] I'm going to live by myself.
[1113.10 → 1120.54] I just go to Costco and buy like little troughs of chicken breast and then just like something like a huge thing of romaine lettuce.
[1120.62 → 1126.08] And I'm like, okay, I'm eating chicken and lettuce, chicken and salad for like a week and a half at least.
[1126.22 → 1128.06] You could even mix it up and have a chicken salad.
[1128.24 → 1128.86] Oh, exactly.
[1129.04 → 1132.42] That's basically where the end of my creativity is because I'm like, I'm going to save money.
[1132.58 → 1134.20] And that's the only thing that I really end at.
[1134.20 → 1140.76] I mean, the other thing many people don't understand very well, and it's not a criticism of them.
[1140.80 → 1145.50] It's just, it's kind of complicated, is how long food is good for.
[1145.88 → 1153.56] So when you add the food, when you start having, you know, codes or chips inside the packaging or whatever else the case may be that the smart fridge can be aware of,
[1153.74 → 1159.20] you put some beef in there and your smart fridge can send you a text message to be like, yo, you haven't cooked this yet.
[1159.20 → 1164.00] You've got probably about six hours to pop it in the freezer before that's just not going to be good for anything anymore.
[1164.20 → 1170.10] We could be looking at a lot of health benefits from a food spoiling perspective as well, which I think is as cool.
[1170.78 → 1180.36] You know, I think when the iPad first came out about six months or a year after, apps Epicurus, and I think apps like Epicurus, which is like sort of interactive recipe program.
[1180.58 → 1184.32] I think those were some of the top sellers in the app store because people were using them in the kitchen.
[1184.32 → 1189.86] So it was a sort of totally unexpected serendipity from sort of having ubiquitous, easy tablet computing.
[1189.86 → 1196.90] It's actually one of the first apps I got for my smartphone when I got it was, I don't remember if it was actually Epicurus,
[1197.08 → 1200.46] but it was one of the ones that is like, oh, I have all of these different things.
[1200.54 → 1201.72] What can I have for dinner tonight?
[1202.12 → 1202.30] Yeah.
[1202.40 → 1203.36] Because it actually helped.
[1203.44 → 1210.26] Like I knew what I could make with that, but I would take this app, and it would spit out something that I wouldn't have thought of or that.
[1210.30 → 1211.20] I didn't even know what it was.
[1211.20 → 1213.00] And it was just a different way of making it.
[1213.08 → 1215.66] It was fascinating to discover a few recipes that way.
[1216.18 → 1226.10] So let's have some discussion about AMD, which is going to be, you know, an uncommon theme on today's show, which is, of course, total BS.
[1226.32 → 1228.16] So let's talk mantle here.
[1228.24 → 1232.08] I just want to go through some tweets for the audience real quick here so that they're kind of up to speed.
[1232.16 → 1235.54] So these are some tweets from James Pryor, who I actually know.
[1235.72 → 1239.20] He's in charge of APU marketing right now.
[1239.20 → 1240.66] He seems like a pretty good guy.
[1240.74 → 1241.88] I've had a couple of calls with him.
[1242.24 → 1245.78] So here are some tweets from Ryan Shroud, again, who will be our guest next week, and James Pryor.
[1245.86 → 1258.04] So Ryan says, you know, this could completely change the landscape for multicore, which has been a sore spot for gamers, game developers, CPU makers who can't scale frequency anymore.
[1258.04 → 1263.86] They need to scale cores to keep the actual power consumption and heat output of these chips down.
[1263.86 → 1274.76] And yet gaming, which really has driven performance in some ways, particularly on the consumer desktop, for a long time, it's just not able to leverage this stuff.
[1275.04 → 1283.56] So Ryan basically goes, okay, yeah, this is going to completely change the game because all of a sudden an FX8350 is just as fast as a Core i7 4770K.
[1283.56 → 1289.92] That is a head explosion moment because a 4770K is a lot faster than an FX8350 in gaming right now.
[1290.34 → 1297.48] James also says with Mantle, they underclocked an FX8350 to 2 gigahertz.
[1297.48 → 1302.46] So we're talking about a frequency that is about 60% of what that can actually run at.
[1302.80 → 1307.50] And the game was still GPU bound on an R9 290X.
[1307.58 → 1309.02] There was no loss in frame rate.
[1309.26 → 1317.42] So CPU performance, and the funny thing about this is AMD is also sort of a CPU company, is moving towards irrelevance.
[1317.82 → 1320.02] I mean, I guess it's great because AMD is also a GPU company.
[1320.12 → 1323.58] And it's funny how many people talked about how the ATI acquisition was going to sync AMD.
[1323.58 → 1327.02] And AMD was like, no, no, it's our future. Trust us.
[1327.34 → 1331.12] Well, I'm just glad they lasted long enough to show us what's going on now.
[1331.36 → 1332.88] So there are a couple other things.
[1333.54 → 1335.74] A frame with Mantle has a lot of unused CPU time.
[1335.84 → 1337.66] There's not a driver hole at all. That's awesome.
[1338.08 → 1346.48] And then this is a comment from Oxide, who's developing an engine that is going to be more geared towards RTS,
[1346.64 → 1351.12] where they're saying they can make RTS games GPU bound for the first time in pretty much forever.
[1351.12 → 1355.56] And they've only had a few months, so they basically haven't had time to optimize it.
[1355.72 → 1361.56] But they figure it's about two man months worth of development time to get Mantle into games.
[1361.72 → 1369.26] So why don't we let, Wendell, why don't you give us your thoughts on this whole Mantle and multithreaded computing optimization thing that's finally happening?
[1369.26 → 1372.32] Okay, so I looked at the presentation.
[1372.60 → 1378.48] I haven't had time to go through it really in depth, because, you know, at the outset, it seems like they're trying to get blood from a turnip,
[1378.56 → 1382.72] because things have really been well optimized in these games for a long time.
[1382.78 → 1385.16] And so it's like, architecturally, what are they doing different? I don't understand.
[1385.62 → 1391.10] Well, in the AMD Mantle video, at 1639, they explain it, and it starts to make sense.
[1391.10 → 1397.94] One of the major things that they do is sort of take out, well, DirectX isn't part of the equation, but, you know, is DirectX really that terrible?
[1398.50 → 1402.14] Well, part of the problem is that DirectX is a little bit monolithic.
[1402.84 → 1409.26] And, you know, when you're adding shaders and things like that, it goes through a bottleneck where all those things that are happening in parallel have to be synchronized.
[1409.26 → 1421.14] But with the Mantle architecture at 1639 in that video, it's showing that they're sort of developing independent queues that can live and exist in different memory space and on different cores on the GPU.
[1421.58 → 1425.52] And so it becomes much less CPU bound at that point, and everything can run in parallel.
[1425.94 → 1428.20] And that sounds really promising.
[1428.20 → 1443.26] So instead of, I mean, so to give the viewers some context, in the early days when we were first getting dual-core processors, and we were all really excited about it, it was kind of like, oh, well, now we can run, like, the in-game AI on one processor.
[1443.56 → 1446.64] And then we can use the other one just to power the graphic experience.
[1446.64 → 1460.10] And then what we realized when we started getting 3 core and 4 core and 6 core processors is that, okay, so now we've got, like, AI here and physics here or on the GPU, depending on if you ask AMD or NVIDIA about that.
[1460.32 → 1463.16] And then we've also got the actual gaming experience here.
[1463.16 → 1472.76] So without the ability to parallelize the actual GPU rendering, the actual rendering of the scene, we were stuck for a really long time.
[1472.84 → 1477.64] And it looks like Mantle is just, according to AMD's claims, going to just flat out fix that.
[1477.72 → 1491.38] Now, they're finally talking numbers, although we had heard rumours earlier of around these numbers, but they're talking about 20 to 50% performance improvements on cards that are a couple of years old with AMD Mantle-enabled games.
[1491.38 → 1493.20] How exciting is that from a consumer standpoint?
[1494.18 → 1496.90] I think that it's going to sort of open up a whole new world.
[1497.08 → 1505.20] It makes sense with their strategy because, you know, the APU has clearly gotten a lot more attention from AMD, you know, R&D and stuff like that.
[1505.76 → 1511.94] And it's really kind of disappointing on the desktop processor side of the world because it's like, hey, you know, there's still room to innovate on the desktop side.
[1512.00 → 1513.84] I mean, let's work on power consumption or something.
[1514.28 → 1521.32] But when you look at it this way, it's like, oh, architecturally, you know, they may be onto something here because this means they're going to be able to do more with
[1521.32 → 1525.18] less and that's where they're going to cut their power and that's where they're going to get their efficiency.
[1526.32 → 1526.68] Absolutely.
[1526.94 → 1531.36] I mean, one thing, there were rumours circulating for a while about a six core.
[1531.80 → 1532.00] Yeah.
[1532.06 → 1540.22] And that's exactly that tweet about down clocking the chip to two gigahertz is like, OK, how much power consumption does an 8350 at two gigahertz have?
[1540.22 → 1541.26] I mean, we don't know.
[1541.36 → 1547.70] I don't think anyone ever tried it because it just didn't perform well enough to try to run it at such a low frequency and do anything with it.
[1547.70 → 1550.98] But that's that that's absolutely game changing.
[1551.10 → 1563.16] I mean, to put this in perspective for the viewers, again, we're talking 20 to 50 percent performance improvement puts a R9 270, which is about a 179.99 graphics card.
[1563.16 → 1573.82] So mainstream performance puts that in the same performance weight class as an R9 280 X, which is a 300 plus dollar graphics card.
[1573.94 → 1578.10] And not that long ago was a 400, 500 dollar graphics card last gen.
[1578.48 → 1580.70] That is absolutely game changing.
[1580.80 → 1583.46] And what can NVIDIA do to address this?
[1583.46 → 1587.10] Well, you know, this is an open platform.
[1587.28 → 1589.46] And so NVIDIA can sort of adopt the model here.
[1589.74 → 1595.90] I think, you know, I don't have any real I don't have any friends that are like really, really inside the game sector.
[1596.02 → 1600.20] I know some people that develop indie games, and they always complain about how terrible DirectX is.
[1600.20 → 1607.50] But how the problem with OpenGL is that it's not like it's standardized across platforms, but it's not the same across platforms.
[1607.50 → 1611.38] And so something that might work great in one situation doesn't work at all in another situation.
[1611.38 → 1613.64] At least you don't have that with DirectX.
[1614.30 → 1620.96] Mantle is an opportunity for AMD to bring that to not just the Windows platform, but probably also Mac and Linux.
[1621.10 → 1623.36] And I'm really hoping that the Linux thing takes off.
[1624.28 → 1624.84] Me too.
[1624.98 → 1634.86] I mean, I don't know if you saw this, but did you see Microsoft sort of, hey, we're we're sorry about the whole PC gaming thing and how we completely crap the bed on that.
[1635.14 → 1637.20] We're going to we're going to we're going to support it better.
[1637.20 → 1645.04] We're going to start by eliminating games for Windows Live, which I think was met by uproarious, you know, hoorays and all of that kind of stuff.
[1645.12 → 1647.34] But is it just too little too late?
[1647.42 → 1653.88] I mean, they had an opportunity really for the last five years to get their crap together.
[1654.28 → 1654.82] You know what?
[1655.00 → 1656.76] Give the PC your Halo game.
[1656.88 → 1657.80] Come on, you guys.
[1658.68 → 1659.84] Is it too late?
[1659.84 → 1665.30] Yeah, I mean, I think the biggest problem with DirectX is the way that the shaders are handled.
[1665.42 → 1666.98] That's apparently one of the big bottlenecks.
[1667.10 → 1675.14] And one of the things about the sort of cues implementation, I guess is what they call it in the video, is that it lets those things sort of live on their own.
[1675.22 → 1680.40] So right now, if you think of it, the GPU, you're giving a bunch of tasks to the GPU that are well suited for the GPU.
[1680.80 → 1684.22] And you have, you know, like Soldier AI and things like that running on the CPU.
[1684.22 → 1689.22] And then at the middle of this mess is DirectX, and DirectX is trying to synchronize all those things.
[1689.60 → 1693.26] And, you know, with Mantle, it's like, hey, we can do this way and this that way.
[1693.36 → 1696.68] And you can, yeah, it makes a lot of sense.
[1696.98 → 1699.70] And it puts stuff in the hands of the developers.
[1700.20 → 1703.12] But it makes sense that the hardware people are providing it.
[1703.20 → 1709.88] And so if Microsoft plays nice and provides a low enough level hardware interface that they don't have to, like, hack the Windows kernel,
[1710.28 → 1713.14] that's what Microsoft needs to do because their expertise is not here.
[1713.14 → 1718.52] They need to step aside and let the experts do what they need to do and give them what they need at an operating system level.
[1718.60 → 1720.12] And that's the best thing they can do for this.
[1720.48 → 1725.56] And at the same time, I actually don't necessarily think it's too little too late because of what Wendell just said.
[1725.88 → 1730.70] And because even though Linux is being much more openly adopted now, it's still that scary word.
[1731.14 → 1735.04] I love Linux, but a lot of people are just scared of it, don't want to try it.
[1735.08 → 1739.66] And the second they sit down in front of them, even though it's not sitting in command console at first or terminal,
[1739.66 → 1742.08] I'm still worried.
[1742.08 → 1744.70] Yeah, I totally don't see this going to desktop Linux right away.
[1744.82 → 1747.70] I think it'll be on the Steam box or something like that.
[1747.78 → 1751.30] And then it'll sort of leak from the Steam box onto Linux desktop.
[1751.50 → 1752.68] I don't think it'll be there overnight.
[1753.00 → 1754.10] But that's exactly it.
[1754.14 → 1755.54] I don't think it'll be overnight either.
[1755.68 → 1757.70] But this is, I mean, this is what I see happening.
[1758.18 → 1760.58] What I see happening is this opening the door.
[1760.58 → 1766.38] Now, okay, to be clear, when Mantle was first talked about, this is, again, this is more for the viewer's benefit.
[1766.88 → 1770.70] It wasn't very clear what exactly it was.
[1770.82 → 1775.10] AMD gave some details, but they were, I think they were waiting for this event to really talk about it.
[1775.48 → 1777.28] And so there were a lot of rumours.
[1777.42 → 1778.78] It was open to NVIDIA.
[1778.90 → 1780.16] It wasn't open to NVIDIA.
[1780.60 → 1782.70] It was running on the PlayStation 4.
[1782.82 → 1783.64] It was running on Xbox.
[1783.84 → 1784.38] Oh, no, it was.
[1784.42 → 1785.42] It's not running on those.
[1785.68 → 1787.32] And it really wasn't clear.
[1787.32 → 1790.34] It'll work on Linux or, you know, I think that one's been pretty clear from the start.
[1790.58 → 1803.24] But what we're finding out now, and this was, again, revealed at the event where Johan Andersen, who is Dice's lead, Dice's lead technical, I think it was a future whatever something.
[1803.32 → 1818.52] He has a complicated title, but basically he's leading future development for the Frostbite Engine series, where he basically said, okay, yeah, it's not the same, but the mantle code for Battlefield 4 looks a lot closer to the PS4 code than it looks to the DirectX code.
[1818.52 → 1818.70] Yeah.
[1819.08 → 1829.60] So if a game developer, I mean, one of the things we've talked about on the show before is that guys like indie game devs, if they were going to pick one, then they might pick DirectX.
[1830.18 → 1832.24] But all of a sudden, that could change.
[1832.48 → 1835.42] Because a lot of indie game devs are developing for console first.
[1835.64 → 1836.00] Right.
[1836.00 → 1840.82] So if they could do it relatively easily, this could be a total game changer.
[1840.94 → 1846.08] And then they could add support for Linux, they could add support for Windows, and all of a sudden, I mean, indie guys love Linux.
[1846.86 → 1847.12] Yeah.
[1847.50 → 1851.68] Well, they love adopting it because then you get that huge horde of people that will support you.
[1851.82 → 1852.04] Yes.
[1852.04 → 1855.80] And they're very outspoken, and we'll talk about it a lot, and your game gets a lot of traction.
[1856.14 → 1860.66] Another thing that I noticed, though, was the I don't remember their name, but those guys making the engine.
[1861.66 → 1862.00] Oxide.
[1862.14 → 1862.50] Oxide.
[1862.60 → 1868.26] We're saying that it takes about, they said it takes almost, not a lot of work, two months of man-hours.
[1868.46 → 1868.66] Yeah.
[1869.24 → 1872.08] So if you have even two devs, you could do it in a month.
[1872.62 → 1875.08] And you can do it like how DICE is doing it.
[1875.08 → 1876.16] I have no problem with that.
[1876.60 → 1879.42] Release the game, and then follow up with mantle support.
[1879.42 → 1879.54] Right.
[1880.10 → 1880.38] Sure.
[1881.32 → 1887.90] Especially for a game that's a multiplayer-oriented game, where we're not talking a single-player campaign that you're going to play through in a week, and then you're going to put the game on the shelf.
[1888.62 → 1890.78] I mean, do people still buy physical games?
[1890.84 → 1892.46] I mean, put it away in your Steam library.
[1894.82 → 1897.78] As long as it's not something like that, then yeah, I have no problem with that.
[1899.06 → 1906.18] As long as mantle is well-supported, not only cross-platform, but also cross-device.
[1906.18 → 1912.86] And that's where, you know, NVIDIA is going to be at a disadvantage implementing this, and I hope that that doesn't impede its adoption.
[1913.22 → 1914.86] But at the same time, you know, you've got to look at Microsoft.
[1915.04 → 1917.54] Microsoft does have a console, and they do have a desktop.
[1918.18 → 1921.02] And, you know, if you think back to the Xbox One, that was just a PC.
[1921.78 → 1927.88] It seems like they could have learned these lessons like 10 years ago and incorporated it into the Windows OS, and one wonders why they didn't.
[1927.88 → 1935.80] I mean, this is a very confusing thing to me.
[1935.90 → 1947.38] And I mean, my outburst about Halo is sort of a microcosm of that, I think, where Microsoft had this opportunity to be everything to everyone for gaming.
[1947.38 → 1949.88] They really did.
[1950.00 → 1960.12] I mean, when PCs got more powerful, why didn't Microsoft just give us an Xbox first-gen emulator and let us buy Xbox games and run them on our PCs?
[1961.22 → 1962.66] Really, guys, why not?
[1963.40 → 1964.28] You could have done it.
[1965.28 → 1969.88] I thought that's where they were headed with the Xbox 360, and then all of a sudden they put, you know, PowerPC.
[1970.08 → 1972.12] They put a Mac processor in the Xbox 360.
[1972.24 → 1972.76] Isn't that right?
[1972.86 → 1974.08] Isn't it a PowerPC?
[1974.08 → 1975.88] Yeah, it's an IBM PowerPC.
[1976.06 → 1978.10] I think it's like a three-core, some weird thing.
[1978.32 → 1979.82] And I saw that, and I went, what?
[1980.30 → 1983.62] You guys were so close to just being dominant here.
[1983.84 → 1985.74] Who could have stopped you at that point?
[1986.16 → 1992.66] And then, and then, if they owned the desktop, and they owned the notebook, and they owned the game console,
[1993.12 → 1998.02] then how much more compelling is something like their mobile platform?
[1998.02 → 2005.62] If all of a sudden I can get this back library, and the Winter alliance can continue, and Intel can get into mobile,
[2005.76 → 2011.04] because all of a sudden they're the ones powering the platform that gamers and enthusiasts want to use.
[2011.42 → 2013.22] How close were they to having that happen?
[2013.32 → 2016.32] How myopic was their view that allowed this to occur?
[2016.58 → 2017.14] What happened here?
[2017.14 → 2020.72] Well, they are back to PC, I guess, now, again, with the x86 architecture.
[2020.92 → 2025.38] One wonders what that has, like, what they've got up their sleeve for the DirectX infrastructure,
[2025.60 → 2029.10] or what the developer kits look like on Xbox One.
[2030.32 → 2033.06] Yeah, yeah, I mean, it's not like they're down for the count.
[2033.14 → 2034.36] It's not like they're out of money.
[2034.44 → 2040.78] I think I saw something not that long ago that says their revenue from Android alone is something like $2 billion a year.
[2040.78 → 2043.98] So they got plenty of money to fix this.
[2046.94 → 2053.64] Alright, so speaking of cross-platform, this is something that, for me personally, is really exciting,
[2053.80 → 2058.94] and that is streaming from larger devices to smaller devices in the home.
[2059.08 → 2064.34] Now, NVIDIA Shield is something that was met with, I think, a very mixed reaction,
[2064.48 → 2065.74] and I think that's being very generous.
[2065.74 → 2067.00] People, for the most part, said,
[2067.00 → 2069.04] Oh, it's too expensive, and it's stupid.
[2069.16 → 2073.72] Why would I even want to play my games on this handheld thing when I could be sitting at my PC?
[2074.08 → 2079.76] And I think the problem is that NVIDIA is trying to approach the traditional PC gamer with this,
[2079.80 → 2083.08] and I think they haven't had much luck communicating to console gamers,
[2083.18 → 2087.94] because there's, for whatever reason, that weird divide between glorious PC gaming master race
[2087.94 → 2091.68] and the console peasants, as the PC guys like to refer to them.
[2092.34 → 2094.94] You know, we can all blame zero punctuation for this.
[2094.94 → 2101.68] But PlayStation 4 is adding a feature that Shield was first to market with,
[2102.02 → 2103.28] and NVIDIA calls it Game Stream,
[2103.46 → 2106.78] where you can stream from your PS4 to a PS Vita
[2106.78 → 2111.34] and play PS4 games on the Vita with, of course, PlayStation 4 graphical fidelity.
[2111.52 → 2112.50] What are your thoughts on this?
[2112.54 → 2113.74] We actually saw it demoed.
[2113.74 → 2115.98] There was a video that came out, I think it was today or yesterday,
[2116.22 → 2118.92] that was showing that the latency is actually very low.
[2118.92 → 2123.10] It's fascinating, this sort of technology.
[2123.26 → 2127.74] I mean, you look at the latency of the transport mechanism, you know, wired versus wireless,
[2128.24 → 2133.36] and I think with the PS4, didn't they mention that the 1080p streams have to be wired?
[2134.38 → 2135.52] Oh, you mean with the Shield?
[2136.26 → 2136.74] Yeah, yeah.
[2136.74 → 2142.52] Yes. Shield has to use a wired USB 2 to gigabit Ethernet adapter,
[2142.76 → 2146.14] so you can tell they need more than 100 megabits sustained,
[2146.46 → 2149.78] but less than a full gigabit, because obviously it's going over USB 2,
[2150.18 → 2152.72] in order to achieve 1080p streaming.
[2153.76 → 2155.92] Okay, so the way to think about this,
[2156.04 → 2157.72] and this is just sort of back of the envelope,
[2157.84 → 2159.12] there are some different approaches here.
[2159.12 → 2162.50] If you're going to stream, you can do it progressive,
[2162.80 → 2164.76] or you can do it block-based.
[2164.80 → 2166.54] If you're doing sort of a progressive stream,
[2166.84 → 2169.10] as soon as the data comes in, you send it out again.
[2169.42 → 2171.76] When you do that, you can't really do any compression.
[2172.32 → 2174.38] You can't compress, that means you're going to have a lot of data,
[2174.46 → 2175.78] you're going to need a really high-speed connection.
[2176.12 → 2178.34] That's not good news for a wireless connection,
[2178.44 → 2181.26] because wireless connections can't handle as much data as a wired connection.
[2181.92 → 2183.22] If you're going to send it in chunks,
[2183.76 → 2186.84] it becomes how fast you can encode each chunk of data.
[2186.84 → 2190.96] So let's say, hypothetically, you've got something running at 10 frames per second.
[2191.10 → 2192.12] Well, why 10 frames per second?
[2192.16 → 2193.22] Because it makes the math easy.
[2193.60 → 2197.52] So 10 frames per second is about 100 milliseconds per frame,
[2197.74 → 2201.10] and if your chunk size is one frame, it gets a frame in,
[2201.16 → 2203.14] it has to convert it, that takes 100 milliseconds.
[2203.60 → 2205.48] You've added 100 milliseconds of latency.
[2205.96 → 2208.58] So even if you have something that runs at 60 frames per second,
[2208.82 → 2213.54] you're adding 1 60th of second of latency to encode that
[2213.54 → 2215.16] and send it down the wire,
[2215.16 → 2217.20] even if it can run at 60 frames per second.
[2217.64 → 2220.12] So you need something absurdly fast
[2220.12 → 2221.88] if you're going to compress it and do something with it.
[2222.00 → 2224.46] If you only want to add one millisecond of latency,
[2224.74 → 2226.90] it has to run at 1,000 frames per second.
[2226.98 → 2229.22] It has to be able to process a frame in a millisecond,
[2229.44 → 2230.70] because that's the delay that it adds.
[2230.76 → 2232.12] Now, to be clear for the viewers,
[2232.34 → 2234.64] Wendell is not talking about FPS,
[2234.94 → 2237.60] like frames per second, in terms of GPU processing.
[2237.60 → 2240.78] He's talking about it in terms of encoding performance.
[2240.88 → 2243.94] So that is taking the larger image and compressing it
[2243.94 → 2246.52] and packing it into something that is much less data intensive.
[2246.84 → 2250.30] So the way that we measure that is also in frames per second.
[2250.42 → 2251.96] So just so that's clear for everyone.
[2252.04 → 2252.96] So sorry, Wendell, keep going.
[2253.76 → 2255.50] No, yeah, no, that's exactly right,
[2255.56 → 2259.78] because you get into a situation where you just physically,
[2260.26 → 2261.84] the thing physically can't keep up.
[2261.84 → 2264.64] And, you know, people, you know, pro gamers say that they can feel,
[2264.76 → 2266.06] you know, 5, 10 milliseconds.
[2266.70 → 2269.60] I don't think any human being can really feel the difference
[2269.60 → 2272.32] much less than about 20 or 25 milliseconds.
[2272.54 → 2274.02] But 20 or 25 milliseconds, I mean,
[2274.32 → 2277.64] you can get a lot of those time slots in a one-second period.
[2277.82 → 2281.14] And so it sounds like that the Shield and the PS4
[2281.14 → 2283.28] maybe are using different kinds of technology.
[2283.44 → 2286.04] And so I think it's going to yield a different consumer experience.
[2286.56 → 2287.36] Very interesting.
[2287.50 → 2289.64] I mean, we know that the reason NVIDIA
[2289.64 → 2292.60] is only allowing Game Stream on Kepler GPUs
[2292.60 → 2294.24] with their hardware-based encoder
[2294.24 → 2298.54] is that they have dedicated hardware on the graphics card
[2298.54 → 2301.56] that is handling this in order to keep the latencies low enough.
[2301.96 → 2307.06] So whatever Sony has done probably isn't that.
[2307.14 → 2307.86] So I think you're right.
[2307.92 → 2309.72] It's very fair to say that they're using
[2309.72 → 2311.32] a completely different implementation.
[2311.90 → 2313.68] One other thing, one other real problem
[2313.68 → 2315.34] I have with Sony's implementation,
[2315.52 → 2317.08] regardless of how they're doing the encoding,
[2317.08 → 2321.12] is that the PS4 only uses 2.4 gigahertz.
[2321.12 → 2323.20] That is single band wireless N,
[2323.70 → 2327.20] which means that as much as this demo might work on,
[2327.38 → 2328.34] you know, in a keynote,
[2328.58 → 2331.68] or the demo might work in a reviewer's office
[2331.68 → 2333.80] where there's one other Wi-Fi network.
[2333.98 → 2335.26] Wait till someone turns a microwave on.
[2335.36 → 2337.18] Wait till someone turns a microwave on.
[2337.30 → 2338.10] Wait till someone...
[2338.10 → 2338.58] Yeah, exactly.
[2338.68 → 2340.58] You bring your Vita into the kitchen
[2340.58 → 2342.56] to like, you know, microwave your pizza pop
[2342.56 → 2343.92] and you want to play a game while you wait.
[2343.92 → 2344.80] Yeah, good luck with that.
[2345.02 → 2346.40] And then wait till someone in an apartment
[2346.40 → 2347.68] buys a PS4 and a Vita
[2347.68 → 2350.62] and there are 100 wireless hotspots within range.
[2350.72 → 2352.14] This is just plain old, not going to work.
[2353.16 → 2354.58] Yeah, it's the wireless situation
[2354.58 → 2355.64] is going to be really bad.
[2355.74 → 2357.92] Even if you, even if everything is ideal,
[2357.92 → 2360.40] if you have two devices going at the same time,
[2360.96 → 2364.20] all of, unless your wireless access point
[2364.20 → 2365.92] is really high-end commercial access point
[2365.92 → 2367.18] that has multiple radios,
[2367.68 → 2369.80] almost all the access points out there
[2369.80 → 2371.94] have trouble sending and receiving multiple streams.
[2371.94 → 2374.56] That's why I like the, you know, triple antenna receiver,
[2374.92 → 2377.18] blah, blah, blah, was sort of in vogue a couple of years ago
[2377.18 → 2380.08] and it's still around with like the dual-band 2.4 and 5 gigahertz.
[2380.58 → 2381.88] That kind of thing mitigates the problem.
[2381.96 → 2384.90] But the 2.4 only, even if you get two devices,
[2385.16 → 2386.76] they're going to be competing with one another.
[2386.94 → 2389.16] And it's like the hardware implementations
[2389.16 → 2390.40] of dealing with that competition
[2390.40 → 2392.46] is only just dirty, dirty hacks
[2392.46 → 2393.48] and it doesn't really work.
[2393.54 → 2394.56] And for something like streaming,
[2394.84 → 2396.22] it's, you can't even watch Netflix.
[2397.12 → 2397.42] Yep.
[2397.78 → 2400.44] No, you're absolutely, absolutely right.
[2400.44 → 2403.28] I mean, NVIDIA just plain old says,
[2403.46 → 2405.12] nope, you don't have,
[2405.24 → 2407.16] you don't have a five gigahertz wireless connection.
[2407.16 → 2408.52] So we're just not even,
[2408.68 → 2410.46] you press it, and it just says, nope.
[2411.36 → 2413.64] They just say, look, you need this router.
[2414.00 → 2414.84] Deal with it.
[2414.94 → 2417.34] Whereas Sony, I think by allowing,
[2417.78 → 2419.26] quote unquote, better compatibility
[2419.26 → 2422.44] is actually going to be hurting the end user experience.
[2422.44 → 2425.20] Yeah, they would have to have a
[2425.40 → 2429.26] like a hardware H.264 encoder or something in hardware
[2429.26 → 2432.24] that can run at like 100, 150 frames per second
[2432.24 → 2433.46] just to make that come out.
[2433.58 → 2436.06] And that's probably not an inexpensive piece of hardware.
[2437.52 → 2437.92] Yeah.
[2438.48 → 2441.58] So, I mean, you know, some thoughts there.
[2441.86 → 2444.98] Now, okay, what we also did just for fun
[2444.98 → 2446.78] is we did a bit of a cost showdown here.
[2446.84 → 2448.30] So maybe I'll let you talk about this, Luke,
[2448.34 → 2449.08] because you worked on it.
[2449.20 → 2450.56] Okay, so we compared a few things.
[2450.56 → 2452.92] So a PS Vita, I looked on New egg,
[2453.00 → 2454.58] so we had more rounded out numbers.
[2454.68 → 2456.14] So this assumes you don't own a Vita,
[2456.24 → 2456.76] because as far as,
[2456.80 → 2458.94] I've never actually seen one in someone's hands.
[2459.12 → 2460.32] So there.
[2461.60 → 2463.36] A PS Vita is about 200 bucks
[2463.36 → 2466.02] and a Shield is about 300 bucks on their own.
[2466.12 → 2466.76] So if you got that,
[2466.84 → 2468.36] but then you need the other hardware to run them.
[2468.44 → 2469.54] So I looked into it and said,
[2469.84 → 2472.36] okay, a PS4 is about 399.
[2472.66 → 2475.92] So with a PS Vita, it's about 599 as a combo
[2475.92 → 2478.64] because I looked around and didn't see any combos for that.
[2478.86 → 2479.86] And we may see bundles.
[2479.86 → 2480.78] We may see bundles.
[2480.88 → 2482.80] So bundles will change the landscape somewhat.
[2483.02 → 2484.22] So, okay, go ahead.
[2484.90 → 2488.20] And then Shield is about 299 as we know,
[2488.40 → 2490.18] but if you buy it with a graphics card,
[2490.26 → 2491.36] so let's say a 770,
[2491.56 → 2493.60] you can get a GTX 770,
[2493.96 → 2494.50] a Shield,
[2494.86 → 2498.30] Batman Arkham Origins.
[2499.40 → 2500.36] Why am I forgetting the name of this?
[2500.36 → 2501.02] Splinter Cell Blacklist
[2501.02 → 2503.06] and Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag.
[2503.18 → 2504.64] So you're getting three games.
[2504.80 → 2506.28] All for 549.
[2506.28 → 2508.12] And if you wanted to buy,
[2508.22 → 2510.80] so that's 599 for a PS4 and a Vita
[2510.80 → 2513.00] or 549 for a 770,
[2513.12 → 2513.46] a Shield,
[2513.66 → 2514.46] three games.
[2514.96 → 2516.88] And if you wanted those three games with the PlayStation,
[2517.18 → 2518.58] it would be around $750.
[2518.58 → 2521.58] So that's pretty compelling looking.
[2521.94 → 2525.14] Expensive PC gaming is starting to look like it makes a lot of sense.
[2525.36 → 2529.52] And if we see NVIDIA support something like Mantle,
[2529.62 → 2529.88] I mean,
[2529.96 → 2530.88] NVIDIA's future,
[2531.04 → 2532.92] even more than we saw already,
[2533.10 → 2536.46] may be in solutions and their mobile processors,
[2537.00 → 2538.62] even more than we already knew.
[2538.62 → 2540.86] Because if they go and support Mantle with this,
[2541.16 → 2543.16] we could be looking at a situation where
[2543.16 → 2545.22] you can take a crap CPU,
[2545.46 → 2546.38] your old machine,
[2546.72 → 2548.56] you can buy a graphics card,
[2548.74 → 2550.08] you can get a Shield
[2550.08 → 2552.16] or some other mobile platform from NVIDIA
[2552.16 → 2553.42] that supports this technology
[2553.42 → 2556.82] and have a great gaming experience
[2556.82 → 2558.22] that's really competitive
[2558.22 → 2560.56] with the price and performance of a console
[2560.56 → 2561.14] and just makes,
[2561.20 → 2561.32] well,
[2561.36 → 2563.16] actually makes console's performance just look stupid.
[2564.74 → 2567.34] Can I get a shout-out to the PC master race?
[2568.62 → 2569.26] I know,
[2569.38 → 2569.48] right?
[2569.54 → 2569.64] Well,
[2569.72 → 2570.88] just the thing of it is,
[2570.96 → 2573.30] I've been using Shield pretty extensively lately.
[2573.38 → 2574.66] I don't find much time to game.
[2574.74 → 2576.54] I don't find much time when I'm sitting at my computer,
[2576.64 → 2578.54] I'm usually uploading videos or something
[2578.54 → 2580.96] or like researching topics for the LAN show.
[2581.02 → 2582.56] It's hard for me to be at my computer
[2582.56 → 2584.14] and just play a game.
[2584.28 → 2585.78] Whereas I got an NVIDIA Shield
[2585.78 → 2588.50] and I've actually almost finished Batman Arkham City
[2588.50 → 2589.52] in the last couple of weeks.
[2589.62 → 2592.00] I'm actually fine because I can play with it in bed.
[2592.28 → 2594.26] It works amazingly well.
[2594.98 → 2596.14] You need a beast router,
[2596.26 → 2597.04] you really do.
[2597.04 → 2599.80] Even my EA 4200 just choked on it.
[2599.86 → 2602.88] I needed to get an Asus RTN66U,
[2603.02 → 2605.72] which is like super two thumbs up for that router.
[2606.30 → 2608.22] But it is an amazing experience
[2608.22 → 2610.30] and people need to get it.
[2610.58 → 2613.18] Like we have a new camera guy that just started.
[2613.32 → 2613.84] He's an intern.
[2614.44 → 2616.06] And he was filming,
[2616.54 → 2619.04] I was talking about these Bluetooth YOGA power controllers
[2619.58 → 2624.08] that give your battery life a bit of a boost on your phone
[2624.08 → 2626.20] and they clip to your phone so you can play Android games.
[2626.44 → 2628.76] And it's like $80 for the high-end one.
[2629.20 → 2630.54] And I showed him a shield.
[2630.62 → 2631.50] He's like, what's that thing?
[2631.54 → 2634.44] I'm like, oh, well, its like got a genuinely console-grade controller.
[2634.60 → 2635.76] It plays your Android games
[2635.76 → 2638.04] and you can stream games from your computer and play them on here.
[2638.06 → 2640.24] And he's like, whoa, really?
[2641.24 → 2643.44] NVIDIA is just so terrible at marketing to mainstream.
[2643.60 → 2645.24] They just have no idea that this exists.
[2645.24 → 2651.04] I think that when the Steam box takes off,
[2651.48 → 2653.70] you're going to see a lot more peripherals like that.
[2653.76 → 2657.12] And I think that it's going to get a lot more visibility.
[2657.78 → 2660.88] But the problem, I guess, that probably Steam has right now
[2660.88 → 2662.96] is that you've got NVIDIA
[2662.96 → 2665.10] that has a lot of these really cool innovative things,
[2665.10 → 2666.16] but they're kind of expensive,
[2666.40 → 2669.02] which is not good from an appliance standpoint.
[2669.18 → 2669.88] And then you have AMD,
[2670.36 → 2671.96] who's sort of bringing the rain
[2671.96 → 2675.66] with very inexpensive hardware on both the CPU and GPU side
[2675.66 → 2676.96] that can really bring it home,
[2677.12 → 2678.60] which is going to be much better suited
[2678.60 → 2680.78] for a console-like PC appliance.
[2681.70 → 2683.50] Yep, that's very, very true.
[2684.08 → 2685.50] So, you know, whether...
[2685.50 → 2687.02] I mean, okay, so NVIDIA's benefit...
[2687.02 → 2688.76] So if we're going to go pros and cons list,
[2689.20 → 2690.68] NVIDIA is going to have Game Stream
[2690.68 → 2692.50] and then AMD by proxy,
[2692.50 → 2693.74] so through SteamOS,
[2693.92 → 2696.62] is going to have the console mode of Game Stream,
[2696.76 → 2697.92] which Shield also supports
[2697.92 → 2700.62] if you get a weird adapter and whatever, whatever, whatever.
[2700.62 → 2702.02] So it's going to be basically,
[2702.32 → 2703.30] do I want to pay more
[2703.30 → 2704.80] to have the mobile experience
[2704.80 → 2706.36] on top of the couch experience,
[2706.36 → 2708.76] or do I want the value-optimized solution
[2708.76 → 2710.46] that spanks the consoles
[2710.46 → 2711.56] in terms of performance
[2711.56 → 2714.46] and, you know, in terms of having all these indie games
[2714.46 → 2715.80] and this huge game library,
[2716.28 → 2718.34] but doesn't support mobile?
[2718.60 → 2719.28] At the same time,
[2719.28 → 2722.76] someone could make an open-platform style of a Shield.
[2723.12 → 2724.60] So a really, really similar product
[2724.60 → 2726.02] that's still running Android,
[2726.20 → 2727.80] but then isn't tied down to a GPU.
[2728.42 → 2730.48] But then NVIDIA's strength a lot of the time
[2730.48 → 2732.20] is in their proprietaries.
[2732.22 → 2732.36] Yeah.
[2732.46 → 2733.40] For better or for worse.
[2733.50 → 2734.38] It's the fact that,
[2734.64 → 2736.28] I mean, we were joking about this earlier,
[2736.38 → 2738.02] as much as this stream is going to be,
[2738.22 → 2739.14] once Wendell leaves,
[2739.18 → 2740.40] we have a bunch more AMD stuff
[2740.40 → 2741.06] where we're going to be like,
[2741.12 → 2742.02] rah, rah, rah, AMD.
[2742.76 → 2745.00] Stuff like Raptor is not competitive
[2745.00 → 2746.54] with stuff like GeForce Experience.
[2746.94 → 2748.36] Stuff like AMD's implementation
[2748.36 → 2749.48] of stereoscopic 3D,
[2749.56 → 2750.42] and we can talk all day
[2750.42 → 2752.38] about whether stereoscopic 3D matters or not,
[2752.40 → 2753.30] and I think we're going to all come
[2753.30 → 2754.10] to the same conclusion
[2754.10 → 2755.08] that no one cares.
[2755.90 → 2758.14] But it wasn't competitive with 3D Vision.
[2758.46 → 2759.60] NVIDIA's great at delivering
[2759.60 → 2760.70] a great experience
[2760.70 → 2762.24] within their closed ecosystem.
[2762.48 → 2763.50] But then open platforms
[2763.50 → 2764.88] can sometimes have that
[2764.88 → 2765.86] shining jewel in the dust.
[2766.02 → 2766.56] There can usually,
[2766.82 → 2767.52] not usually,
[2767.62 → 2769.08] there can sometimes be the open platform
[2769.08 → 2770.78] that is better than the proprietary platform.
[2770.96 → 2771.10] Yep.
[2771.18 → 2772.20] And if you make something like that,
[2772.22 → 2772.88] it is possible
[2772.88 → 2773.90] that some big group
[2773.90 → 2774.78] will step behind it,
[2774.98 → 2776.40] like maybe Splash top.
[2776.42 → 2777.58] They could maybe be the back end,
[2777.64 → 2778.80] so there's a company behind it
[2778.80 → 2779.64] that could push it forward,
[2779.82 → 2780.96] and it could still make it.
[2781.02 → 2781.84] Some of AMD stuff
[2781.84 → 2782.50] that's open platform
[2782.50 → 2783.42] is still very strong.
[2783.42 → 2784.12] You know,
[2784.14 → 2784.64] it's interesting
[2784.64 → 2785.76] you mentioned Splash top
[2785.76 → 2788.64] because I have an iPad,
[2789.14 → 2790.22] and on the iPad,
[2790.34 → 2791.30] I have Splash top,
[2791.48 → 2792.64] and I've experimented with it,
[2792.86 → 2794.16] and on newer iPads,
[2794.24 → 2796.86] it is actually disturbingly fast.
[2797.28 → 2799.44] But when I'm on an access point
[2799.44 → 2800.70] that's only 2.4 gigahertz,
[2800.82 → 2802.74] it is a completely different experience
[2802.74 → 2803.98] than when it's on 5 gigahertz.
[2804.24 → 2804.32] Yeah.
[2805.40 → 2805.68] I mean,
[2805.74 → 2806.36] I think we can,
[2806.50 → 2806.86] sorry, go ahead.
[2806.94 → 2807.64] People would have to have
[2807.64 → 2809.04] the right hardware implementations
[2809.04 → 2810.56] all around to make it work,
[2810.62 → 2811.50] and if Splash top made
[2811.50 → 2813.36] some very optimized
[2813.36 → 2815.66] application sources
[2815.66 → 2816.82] for running games,
[2817.18 → 2818.10] it could maybe be better,
[2818.46 → 2819.34] and they could have it
[2819.34 → 2820.70] in gaming mode or something,
[2820.80 → 2821.94] so it works that way better.
[2822.18 → 2823.12] Something in the future,
[2823.28 → 2825.36] but for an open platform
[2825.36 → 2825.92] to work like that,
[2825.98 → 2826.68] there would need to be
[2826.68 → 2827.38] some big factor.
[2827.54 → 2827.76] I mean,
[2827.78 → 2828.80] I think the networking guys
[2828.80 → 2829.48] have to be licking
[2829.48 → 2830.48] their chops right now.
[2830.62 → 2830.88] Yeah.
[2831.00 → 2832.28] Because all this technology
[2832.28 → 2833.38] is going to rely on people
[2833.38 → 2835.60] to finally go and upgrade
[2835.60 → 2837.14] their wireless G routers.
[2837.78 → 2838.70] Because up until now,
[2838.76 → 2839.20] web browsing?
[2839.46 → 2839.66] Why?
[2839.66 → 2840.98] You know,
[2841.40 → 2843.40] there is a piece
[2843.40 → 2844.28] of wireless technology
[2844.28 → 2845.30] that I have actually
[2845.30 → 2846.10] been impressed with,
[2846.30 → 2847.22] and it's mundane,
[2847.74 → 2849.02] and I think you'll be surprised,
[2849.24 → 2852.02] but it's the Dell wireless dock
[2852.02 → 2853.50] for their latitudes.
[2853.98 → 2854.82] It's like some sort
[2854.82 → 2855.78] of high frequency.
[2855.94 → 2856.78] It's like 8 gigahertz
[2856.78 → 2857.72] or something special,
[2858.16 → 2858.98] and I'm used to,
[2859.00 → 2859.14] you know,
[2859.18 → 2860.26] a good docking solution,
[2860.36 → 2861.18] but it's got a range
[2861.18 → 2862.42] of like 6 feet.
[2862.60 → 2863.08] It literally,
[2863.28 → 2864.06] if it's more than 6 feet
[2864.06 → 2864.62] away from the dock,
[2864.64 → 2865.24] it doesn't work.
[2865.56 → 2866.54] But it can deliver,
[2866.96 → 2867.26] you know,
[2867.36 → 2868.34] on the docking station,
[2868.34 → 2869.24] I've got three,
[2869.36 → 2869.74] you know,
[2869.90 → 2872.34] 1920 by 1200 monitor outputs
[2872.34 → 2873.62] and the USB 3
[2873.62 → 2875.00] and all these really
[2875.00 → 2875.92] high-speed peripherals,
[2876.04 → 2877.22] and it sort of freaks me out
[2877.22 → 2878.04] that I don't have to plug
[2878.04 → 2879.38] the laptop into anything,
[2879.86 → 2881.02] and that's a nice technology.
[2881.50 → 2882.32] That's pretty awesome,
[2882.42 → 2882.72] actually.
[2883.16 → 2884.24] But the range is terrible.
[2884.90 → 2885.76] But the range is terrible.
[2885.86 → 2886.26] You know what?
[2886.34 → 2887.82] Samsung had something similar
[2887.82 → 2889.12] with their central station.
[2889.64 → 2890.36] I don't think
[2890.36 → 2891.16] they were using
[2891.16 → 2891.92] high frequency.
[2892.08 → 2892.62] They were using
[2892.62 → 2894.48] a proprietary USB 3
[2894.48 → 2895.22] of some sort.
[2895.22 → 2897.02] I did a video about it
[2897.02 → 2897.66] a long time ago.
[2897.74 → 2898.58] I can't remember how it worked
[2898.58 → 2899.00] because it was
[2899.00 → 2900.02] prohibitively expensive,
[2900.60 → 2901.84] but it was a very,
[2901.98 → 2903.04] very similar concept
[2903.04 → 2904.06] where the idea
[2904.06 → 2905.00] was that you just
[2905.00 → 2905.68] brought your PC
[2905.68 → 2906.52] within range
[2906.52 → 2907.70] and then it had a dongle
[2907.70 → 2908.48] that you had to
[2908.48 → 2909.82] plug into the PC.
[2910.00 → 2910.92] It was USB-based
[2910.92 → 2911.22] because...
[2912.22 → 2913.20] Whereas Dell,
[2913.34 → 2913.50] I guess,
[2913.56 → 2914.54] can just build this functionality
[2914.54 → 2915.64] into their laptops,
[2915.84 → 2916.92] but when you brought it
[2916.92 → 2917.34] in range,
[2917.40 → 2918.34] you were able to
[2918.34 → 2919.56] wirelessly transmit,
[2919.90 → 2920.22] you know,
[2920.28 → 2920.90] all the signalling
[2920.90 → 2922.26] for your peripherals
[2922.26 → 2923.60] and Ethernet
[2923.60 → 2924.94] and display
[2924.94 → 2926.70] from the laptop
[2926.70 → 2927.44] to the display
[2927.44 → 2928.04] where it would act
[2928.04 → 2928.66] as a hub
[2928.66 → 2929.00] that you could
[2929.00 → 2929.70] plug everything into.
[2929.88 → 2931.54] So this kind of stuff
[2931.54 → 2932.64] is very,
[2932.80 → 2933.74] very much the future.
[2933.88 → 2935.08] I'm excited about wireless.
[2935.20 → 2935.96] I've hated wireless
[2935.96 → 2936.78] for a long time,
[2936.86 → 2937.52] but wireless AC
[2937.52 → 2938.80] even actually addresses
[2938.80 → 2939.90] a lot of my issues with it.
[2939.92 → 2940.78] Have you played around
[2940.78 → 2941.40] with AC much?
[2942.38 → 2942.58] Yeah.
[2942.66 → 2943.20] At home,
[2943.32 → 2944.84] I've got a Cisco
[2944.84 → 2945.90] commercial-grade
[2945.90 → 2947.32] wireless AC
[2947.32 → 2948.30] access point.
[2948.44 → 2948.86] Of course you do.
[2949.18 → 2949.62] Yeah,
[2949.66 → 2950.78] I don't want to fool around.
[2950.78 → 2952.34] Wow,
[2952.44 → 2952.84] that's awesome.
[2952.86 → 2953.40] What will one of those
[2953.40 → 2953.68] run you?
[2955.08 → 2955.40] Well,
[2955.46 → 2956.12] if you get them retail,
[2956.22 → 2956.78] they're about $1,000,
[2957.04 → 2958.02] but if you know a guy,
[2958.10 → 2958.46] you can get them
[2958.46 → 2959.00] for about $300.
[2959.40 → 2959.68] All right.
[2961.20 → 2961.84] You've actually
[2961.84 → 2962.72] piqued my interest
[2962.72 → 2964.60] with that $300 price point.
[2964.94 → 2965.30] Yeah.
[2966.52 → 2966.88] Yeah.
[2967.08 → 2967.22] Well,
[2967.24 → 2967.66] it turns out
[2967.66 → 2968.32] if you want to paint
[2968.32 → 2968.88] the neighbourhood
[2968.88 → 2969.60] with the signal,
[2969.68 → 2970.32] that's what you need.
[2971.70 → 2972.26] All righty then.
[2973.16 → 2973.48] Fascinating.
[2973.84 → 2974.10] Okay,
[2974.22 → 2974.44] well,
[2974.58 → 2975.08] you know what?
[2975.08 → 2975.90] I think that was
[2975.90 → 2976.50] pretty much it
[2976.50 → 2977.04] for the topics
[2977.04 → 2978.20] that we had lined up.
[2978.48 → 2979.50] I would love for,
[2979.66 → 2979.96] guys,
[2979.96 → 2981.50] let Logan,
[2981.78 → 2983.60] give Logan a big thank-you.
[2983.76 → 2983.94] So,
[2984.14 → 2985.16] I think it's
[2985.16 → 2985.88] at Tech Syndicate
[2985.88 → 2986.56] on Twitter
[2986.56 → 2988.20] for allowing us
[2988.20 → 2989.02] to have some
[2989.02 → 2989.98] of Wendell's time.
[2990.12 → 2990.28] You know,
[2990.34 → 2991.02] I know that
[2991.02 → 2992.08] you guys are
[2992.08 → 2993.02] an awesome tag team
[2993.02 → 2993.50] over there
[2993.50 → 2994.72] and we've had Logan
[2994.72 → 2995.62] on the show before.
[2995.80 → 2996.70] It's been a total pleasure
[2996.70 → 2997.22] to have you.
[2997.30 → 2998.24] You've been requested
[2998.24 → 3000.06] so much.
[3000.14 → 3000.22] So,
[3000.30 → 3000.64] I want to,
[3000.70 → 3000.88] you know,
[3000.94 → 3001.42] thank you,
[3001.62 → 3002.54] your team collectively,
[3002.70 → 3003.52] both Logan and you,
[3003.62 → 3004.58] for being generous enough
[3004.58 → 3005.66] to lend us some of your time
[3005.66 → 3006.48] and some of your expertise.
[3006.68 → 3006.98] This has been
[3006.98 → 3007.88] absolutely fantastic.
[3007.88 → 3009.04] Oh,
[3009.08 → 3009.50] no problem.
[3009.60 → 3010.00] Anytime,
[3010.12 → 3010.34] anytime.
[3011.16 → 3011.96] It's all good.
[3012.10 → 3012.80] I'll let him know
[3012.80 → 3013.40] that I'm being returned
[3013.40 → 3014.84] in slightly used condition,
[3014.94 → 3015.42] but it's okay.
[3016.40 → 3017.40] We haven't abused you
[3017.40 → 3017.96] too much here,
[3017.98 → 3018.30] have we?
[3019.70 → 3020.06] No,
[3020.12 → 3020.28] no,
[3020.32 → 3020.86] it's all good.
[3021.12 → 3021.72] Twitch chat,
[3021.80 → 3022.78] tell Wendell he's great,
[3022.84 → 3023.10] okay?
[3023.36 → 3023.68] You know,
[3023.76 → 3025.24] we don't want to beat him up
[3025.24 → 3025.66] over here.
[3025.74 → 3025.96] Yeah,
[3026.02 → 3026.58] everyone says,
[3026.66 → 3026.96] come back,
[3027.02 → 3027.32] come back,
[3027.32 → 3028.16] we can't live without you.
[3028.22 → 3028.34] Yeah,
[3028.40 → 3029.08] they love you.
[3029.12 → 3029.22] So,
[3029.28 → 3029.96] thank you very much,
[3030.04 → 3030.22] man.
[3030.54 → 3030.84] Remember,
[3030.94 → 3031.16] guys,
[3031.20 → 3032.38] you can watch Wendell
[3032.38 → 3034.30] over on the Tech Syndicate
[3034.30 → 3035.04] YouTube channel,
[3035.14 → 3035.46] which is
[3035.46 → 3036.30] YouTube.com
[3036.30 → 3036.90] slash
[3036.90 → 3038.08] raised the world
[3038.08 → 3039.60] with that O being a zero,
[3039.74 → 3040.56] which I've teased him
[3040.56 → 3041.32] about endlessly.
[3041.32 → 3041.78] I was like,
[3041.84 → 3042.02] dude,
[3042.10 → 3043.26] what were you thinking?
[3043.58 → 3044.52] But now it's too late.
[3044.64 → 3044.98] So,
[3045.20 → 3045.60] there you go,
[3045.64 → 3046.28] he's stuck with it.
[3046.36 → 3046.52] So,
[3046.58 → 3047.26] I'll talk to you soon,
[3047.32 → 3047.46] man.
[3048.02 → 3048.40] Take care,
[3048.52 → 3048.80] thanks.
[3049.16 → 3049.50] All right,
[3049.50 → 3049.90] take care.
[3051.36 → 3051.98] All right,
[3052.08 → 3052.46] so,
[3052.66 → 3053.88] let's move,
[3053.98 → 3054.20] oh,
[3054.30 → 3055.74] our sponsor break.
[3055.92 → 3056.04] Dun,
[3056.10 → 3056.24] dun,
[3056.30 → 3057.92] I remembered for a change.
[3058.06 → 3058.20] Oh,
[3058.26 → 3058.70] what do I do?
[3058.88 → 3059.34] Just close it?
[3059.84 → 3060.20] Close it.
[3060.30 → 3060.66] Got it.
[3060.66 → 3061.34] All right,
[3061.42 → 3062.24] sponsor breaks time.
[3062.38 → 3062.58] So,
[3062.72 → 3063.10] guys,
[3063.32 → 3064.78] our sponsor for this show
[3064.78 → 3066.12] is generously,
[3066.54 → 3067.20] Hotspot Shield,
[3067.30 → 3068.62] the easy VPN solution
[3068.62 → 3069.90] that you can get 20%
[3069.90 → 3071.38] off of their elite prices
[3071.38 → 3072.80] by using offer code Linus.
[3072.96 → 3074.86] It apparently is a little bit complicated
[3074.86 → 3076.38] to use offer code Linus,
[3076.48 → 3076.68] so,
[3077.06 → 3078.22] guys,
[3078.44 → 3079.42] in the video description,
[3079.56 → 3080.94] I will post a link to the forum thread
[3080.94 → 3082.30] where I will post instructions
[3082.30 → 3084.40] for how to take advantage of it.
[3084.44 → 3086.20] I've actually been using Hotspot Shield.
[3086.56 → 3088.76] I had to use it to order Google Glass,
[3089.12 → 3090.02] in fact.
[3090.02 → 3091.62] No,
[3091.68 → 3091.76] no,
[3091.76 → 3092.08] don't worry,
[3092.14 → 3092.50] it's shipped.
[3092.74 → 3093.04] Okay,
[3093.18 → 3093.54] yeah.
[3094.96 → 3095.54] I was like,
[3095.62 → 3096.46] wait until it's,
[3096.54 → 3096.68] yeah,
[3096.76 → 3096.88] no,
[3096.92 → 3097.02] no,
[3097.04 → 3097.40] don't worry,
[3097.52 → 3098.70] it's a done deal.
[3098.84 → 3098.98] So,
[3099.06 → 3100.66] because Google Glass Explorer Edition
[3100.66 → 3102.34] is only available to U.S. residents,
[3103.00 → 3105.46] what happens is I had to get an invitation,
[3105.62 → 3107.52] which Marcus Brownlee was generous enough
[3107.52 → 3108.62] to get over to me,
[3108.98 → 3111.08] then I had to use a VPN
[3111.08 → 3112.98] to even go to the link
[3112.98 → 3114.00] that was in my invite,
[3114.32 → 3116.62] then I had to get Austin Evans,
[3117.26 → 3117.76] Austin,
[3117.84 → 3118.28] not Duncan,
[3118.28 → 3119.50] on Twitter,
[3119.50 → 3119.94] okay,
[3119.98 → 3121.12] I had to get Austin Evans
[3121.12 → 3124.80] to generously let me use his credit card,
[3125.06 → 3126.26] okay,
[3126.52 → 3129.66] because I had to have a U.S.-based credit card,
[3130.00 → 3130.56] then,
[3130.70 → 3131.34] didn't know that part.
[3131.38 → 3131.48] Okay,
[3131.54 → 3131.92] get this,
[3131.98 → 3132.32] get this,
[3132.38 → 3132.54] okay,
[3132.54 → 3134.38] I had to have it shipped
[3134.38 → 3137.58] to my old OCT sales rep,
[3138.10 → 3138.62] okay,
[3138.76 → 3141.36] back from when I worked at NCI,
[3141.78 → 3142.34] okay,
[3142.34 → 3143.70] because I'm going to her wedding,
[3143.70 → 3144.74] okay,
[3144.74 → 3147.04] so I had to get it shipped there,
[3147.36 → 3149.44] and then I'm going to go pick it up next week.
[3149.80 → 3150.12] Oh,
[3150.12 → 3150.30] no.
[3150.30 → 3151.20] Oh,
[3151.20 → 3151.82] so anyway,
[3151.96 → 3155.54] Hotspot Shield allowed me to coordinate all of this
[3155.54 → 3157.32] by actually confirming the link
[3157.32 → 3159.00] and being logged into my account
[3159.00 → 3161.74] and spoofing that I was based out of the U.S.
[3161.74 → 3164.94] by using a U.S.-based Hotspot Shield address.
[3164.94 → 3167.96] So Hotspot Shield allows you to,
[3167.96 → 3169.76] to fake where you're from,
[3170.04 → 3171.92] get around geographical restrictions,
[3172.76 → 3173.12] and,
[3173.12 → 3174.06] and basically,
[3174.06 → 3176.42] not that we necessarily recommend doing those things
[3176.42 → 3177.74] in most situations.
[3177.76 → 3179.34] And protect your privacy online,
[3179.44 → 3181.26] making it much more difficult for anyone
[3181.26 → 3182.40] who is trying to,
[3182.44 → 3183.74] to find out who you are
[3183.74 → 3184.90] and where you're from.
[3184.98 → 3186.42] And so there are all kinds of crazy stuff
[3186.42 → 3187.70] you can do with VPNs,
[3187.70 → 3189.70] or you can just use it to get U.S. Netflix,
[3189.86 → 3190.08] which is,
[3190.18 → 3190.30] I think,
[3190.34 → 3191.16] what a lot of people do.
[3191.20 → 3191.54] So guys,
[3191.86 → 3192.50] one more time,
[3192.58 → 3193.84] thanks to Hotspot Shield
[3193.84 → 3196.26] for providing our VPN solution here,
[3196.38 → 3198.98] as well as for sponsoring the show
[3198.98 → 3201.42] and giving us 20% off to offer to you guys
[3201.42 → 3203.04] when you're using offer code Linus.
[3203.46 → 3203.68] And,
[3203.80 → 3205.28] Not that we necessarily recommend
[3205.28 → 3207.32] cheating the system to get U.S. Netflix either.
[3208.12 → 3210.42] We're just observing that many of you
[3210.42 → 3210.50] might do that.
[3210.50 → 3211.56] Many of you would do that.
[3211.66 → 3213.10] I saw it posted about on the forum or something.
[3213.52 → 3215.52] So Squarespace isn't a sponsor today,
[3215.58 → 3217.72] but I do actually want to point out something.
[3217.84 → 3218.26] So guys,
[3218.36 → 3219.54] last week we announced
[3219.54 → 3221.64] that Squarespace was doing a
[3221.64 → 3222.30] design your own,
[3222.42 → 3223.78] win your own website thing.
[3224.04 → 3225.68] So all you got to do is sign up for the trial
[3225.68 → 3227.14] at Sparitsquarespace.com
[3227.14 → 3228.78] and then submit it to me
[3228.78 → 3229.80] with hashtag,
[3229.94 → 3230.46] oh crap.
[3230.54 → 3231.20] What was the hashtag?
[3231.32 → 3231.46] Okay,
[3231.52 → 3232.62] go back to last week's WAN show
[3232.62 → 3233.44] and check out the hashtag.
[3233.72 → 3235.34] If you tweet it with that hashtag,
[3235.56 → 3236.62] then you will have a chance.
[3236.66 → 3238.34] I'm going to announce sometime this week,
[3238.38 → 3239.04] the winner.
[3239.18 → 3241.36] So you will win your website for a year.
[3241.44 → 3242.82] They handle all the hosting and all that.
[3242.92 → 3244.86] So I just wanted to remind you guys about that.
[3245.30 → 3245.54] So,
[3245.54 → 3247.14] one thing before you start going,
[3247.40 → 3248.62] when I was reading off the games,
[3248.84 → 3250.46] whenever I read SC,
[3250.80 → 3251.28] I had Star Craft.
[3251.28 → 3252.28] my brain stops.
[3252.98 → 3253.28] I know.
[3253.76 → 3254.04] I know.
[3254.08 → 3255.24] And will not go past Star Craft.
[3255.24 → 3256.76] I was even thinking it when I typed it.
[3256.84 → 3258.18] I was thinking it when I typed it.
[3258.22 → 3258.58] I was like,
[3258.64 → 3259.40] I'm going to think of Star Craft.
[3259.44 → 3260.66] And it's SCB.
[3261.12 → 3262.08] So it's like Star Craft Ruble.
[3262.28 → 3262.56] Yeah.
[3262.80 → 3263.66] And then there's,
[3263.66 → 3264.90] then there's BAO.
[3265.04 → 3265.48] And I'm like,
[3265.70 → 3266.22] black,
[3266.88 → 3267.28] something.
[3267.62 → 3267.76] Yeah.
[3268.00 → 3268.14] What?
[3269.20 → 3269.52] No.
[3269.62 → 3269.82] Okay.
[3269.92 → 3270.30] So yeah.
[3270.98 → 3271.78] So long.
[3272.32 → 3273.50] I knew what they were too,
[3273.60 → 3275.22] but I was just reading those acronyms.
[3275.32 → 3277.18] My head just completely froze.
[3277.30 → 3277.40] Yeah.
[3277.44 → 3277.96] SC too.
[3278.04 → 3279.36] Also Supreme Commander too.
[3279.60 → 3279.80] Yeah.
[3279.80 → 3282.58] Which I never got because I was always thinking Star Craft.
[3282.90 → 3283.22] Yeah.
[3283.74 → 3284.14] Man.
[3284.22 → 3284.40] Okay.
[3284.52 → 3284.76] Anyway.
[3285.02 → 3285.62] So yeah.
[3285.74 → 3286.14] So anyway,
[3286.28 → 3287.48] we're going to have Google Glass.
[3287.58 → 3288.16] So that's the thing.
[3288.20 → 3289.10] That's going to be really cool.
[3289.10 → 3289.80] I can't believe.
[3289.80 → 3292.40] My new gen Kindle paperweight arrived today.
[3293.10 → 3295.12] Do you remember how long ago I ordered that stupid thing?
[3295.24 → 3295.58] A month?
[3295.64 → 3295.66] At least?
[3295.66 → 3296.04] And I was like,
[3296.04 → 3296.26] yeah,
[3296.36 → 3298.14] I want to do an unboxing while it's still relevant.
[3300.18 → 3300.54] Yeah.
[3300.54 → 3301.38] It was like six weeks.
[3301.54 → 3302.26] It's like ridiculous.
[3302.50 → 3302.68] It's like,
[3302.76 → 3303.70] thanks for that Amazon.
[3303.92 → 3304.56] They shipped the
[3304.58 → 3305.78] they shipped the cover for it.
[3305.80 → 3306.00] The cover,
[3306.10 → 3306.18] yeah.
[3306.18 → 3306.80] Back when I ordered,
[3306.90 → 3307.94] I don't even know where it is anymore.
[3308.68 → 3310.10] I haven't seen it in a long time.
[3310.12 → 3310.48] Me neither.
[3310.62 → 3312.00] It's probably under a pile of things.
[3312.32 → 3312.68] Ridiculous.
[3312.88 → 3313.20] Anyway,
[3313.20 → 3314.64] I love Amazon a lot,
[3314.76 → 3315.88] but some things I don't love.
[3316.20 → 3319.28] So let's just move on to our next topic here,
[3319.28 → 3320.16] which is,
[3320.56 → 3320.80] ah,
[3320.88 → 3321.22] yes,
[3321.34 → 3322.60] more AMD news.
[3322.74 → 3323.24] Of course.
[3323.40 → 3326.84] AMD has updated the Never Settle Forever program.
[3327.16 → 3328.00] In a super confusing way.
[3328.00 → 3329.54] In a super confusing way.
[3329.60 → 3331.34] Because back when Never Settle came out,
[3331.40 → 3331.98] it was like,
[3332.44 → 3332.76] look,
[3332.96 → 3333.88] this is great.
[3334.22 → 3335.42] Buy all the graphics cards,
[3335.54 → 3336.38] get all the games.
[3336.58 → 3337.20] You love it.
[3337.20 → 3338.16] And we did.
[3338.42 → 3338.86] We did.
[3338.98 → 3339.14] Boy,
[3339.20 → 3339.92] did we ever love it.
[3339.94 → 3339.98] Oh,
[3340.00 → 3340.34] definitely.
[3340.48 → 3340.66] Oh,
[3340.74 → 3341.24] we loved it.
[3342.74 → 3343.06] Okay,
[3343.20 → 3343.86] so now,
[3344.08 → 3346.26] it is about the most confusing chart
[3346.26 → 3347.50] that I've ever seen in my life,
[3347.56 → 3347.80] which,
[3348.28 → 3348.56] you know,
[3348.64 → 3350.66] I've seen a lot of confusing charts in my life.
[3350.66 → 3350.68] Oh,
[3350.70 → 3350.88] wait,
[3350.94 → 3351.56] before we keep going,
[3351.64 → 3353.10] we should do a Twitter Blitz after this or something.
[3353.20 → 3353.40] Yeah,
[3353.48 → 3353.72] okay.
[3353.98 → 3354.56] So guys,
[3354.78 → 3356.00] Twitter Blitz something.
[3356.16 → 3357.12] We didn't end up having time
[3357.12 → 3358.82] because Wendell was an amazing guest
[3358.82 → 3360.54] and we wanted to talk to him about all the things,
[3360.62 → 3362.54] so we didn't end up getting to do a Twitter Blitz with him.
[3362.62 → 3364.98] But let's just do like random Q&A.
[3365.24 → 3365.72] Hit us.
[3366.30 → 3366.76] All right.
[3368.08 → 3368.52] So,
[3368.70 → 3369.14] first,
[3369.18 → 3370.04] there's this graphic,
[3370.26 → 3370.84] which is like,
[3371.02 → 3371.34] okay,
[3371.44 → 3371.64] what?
[3372.58 → 3373.02] So,
[3373.26 → 3377.24] R9 270 and up to R9 290X
[3377.24 → 3379.24] has Battlefield 4 with a checkbox.
[3379.34 → 3379.54] Maybe.
[3379.88 → 3380.20] Maybe.
[3380.20 → 3380.26] Maybe.
[3380.38 → 3381.26] Which is confusing
[3381.26 → 3384.58] because AMD is providing codes to retailers.
[3385.34 → 3385.60] Maybe.
[3386.00 → 3386.30] Maybe.
[3386.74 → 3387.52] Depending on the quality,
[3387.58 → 3388.78] to qualifying retailers.
[3389.10 → 3390.54] And the retailers will,
[3390.70 → 3391.64] at their discretion,
[3391.64 → 3395.70] bundle this game with their cards.
[3395.98 → 3396.26] Maybe.
[3396.48 → 3396.74] Maybe.
[3396.88 → 3397.80] While supplies last.
[3397.92 → 3398.18] Maybe.
[3398.60 → 3398.86] Maybe.
[3399.34 → 3399.98] So,
[3400.24 → 3400.74] basically,
[3400.98 → 3402.96] unless you have verified
[3402.96 → 3404.76] that the retail you're buying from
[3404.76 → 3406.28] is providing that game
[3406.28 → 3407.62] with that card,
[3408.14 → 3408.92] nothing is guaranteed.
[3409.34 → 3409.50] Okay.
[3409.92 → 3410.42] Then,
[3410.56 → 3411.72] R7 260X,
[3411.84 → 3412.86] so the only one
[3412.86 → 3414.52] out of the new generation cards
[3414.52 → 3416.82] to be added to Never Settle Forever,
[3417.02 → 3417.40] officially,
[3417.76 → 3418.74] even though some retailers
[3418.74 → 3420.02] have Never been doing Settle Forever
[3420.02 → 3421.02] on new gen cards,
[3421.08 → 3421.82] such as NCI,
[3422.42 → 3424.52] which is why I got confused
[3424.52 → 3425.62] and was saying that it was on it
[3425.62 → 3426.98] because NCI was shipping them.
[3427.18 → 3427.38] Anyway,
[3427.74 → 3428.68] so that has been added
[3428.68 → 3431.22] to the silver Never Settle Forever,
[3431.44 → 3432.72] which means you get two games.
[3433.10 → 3433.28] Okay.
[3433.90 → 3434.12] So,
[3434.18 → 3434.68] hold on a second.
[3434.94 → 3436.08] It's not over yet, folks.
[3436.76 → 3436.94] So,
[3437.02 → 3438.16] I don't even know what this is.
[3438.16 → 3441.82] I'm using this stupid Metro Internet Explorer,
[3441.98 → 3442.52] so I don't even,
[3442.66 → 3443.92] I don't know what I'm doing right now.
[3444.08 → 3444.48] So,
[3444.54 → 3446.68] let's go ahead and open this again.
[3446.94 → 3447.08] Oh,
[3447.08 → 3447.60] this is a
[3448.30 → 3448.68] yeah.
[3448.68 → 3449.96] It looks so Chrome-like now.
[3450.02 → 3450.64] Really annoying.
[3452.06 → 3452.46] Yeah,
[3452.68 → 3452.84] I'm,
[3452.84 → 3453.16] I'm,
[3453.40 → 3454.44] I'm not happy.
[3454.60 → 3454.76] Okay,
[3454.84 → 3455.14] so there,
[3455.22 → 3455.40] okay,
[3455.46 → 3456.08] so there's that.
[3456.50 → 3456.72] So,
[3456.78 → 3457.96] then Never Settle Forever
[3457.96 → 3459.64] has also been altered.
[3460.18 → 3460.58] Okay,
[3460.66 → 3461.70] so let's scroll down
[3461.70 → 3463.32] and let's open up this graph.
[3463.38 → 3463.48] So,
[3463.48 → 3464.86] this is from videocards.com
[3464.86 → 3465.66] just so that we make sure
[3465.66 → 3465.88] we're,
[3465.88 → 3466.86] we're crediting the source
[3466.86 → 3469.00] because I didn't make these graphs.
[3469.10 → 3469.42] Mind you,
[3469.48 → 3470.62] I don't think they necessarily
[3470.62 → 3471.30] made all of them either.
[3471.36 → 3471.64] All right.
[3471.80 → 3472.18] So,
[3472.22 → 3473.34] they have added Thief
[3473.34 → 3474.92] to Never Settle Forever,
[3475.18 → 3477.82] but only in the silver and gold tiers.
[3478.98 → 3479.28] I mean,
[3479.32 → 3480.24] talk about tearful.
[3480.38 → 3481.80] Not the 200 tier.
[3481.96 → 3482.38] Not the
[3482.38 → 3483.22] or whatever.
[3483.36 → 3484.06] Not the bronze tier.
[3484.22 → 3484.40] So,
[3484.46 → 3485.06] you can pick,
[3485.32 → 3486.20] in the bronze tier,
[3486.46 → 3487.96] one game out of the list
[3487.96 → 3488.96] of qualifying games,
[3489.06 → 3489.86] which is not BF,
[3489.86 → 3492.06] so BF4 is only on R9 200 series,
[3492.18 → 3493.56] not available in Never Settle Forever,
[3493.82 → 3494.80] doesn't include Tomb Raider,
[3494.96 → 3495.86] doesn't include Thief,
[3495.94 → 3496.12] okay,
[3496.18 → 3497.38] but you can pick one of these.
[3497.56 → 3497.86] Then,
[3497.92 → 3498.56] in the silver tier,
[3498.64 → 3499.76] you can pick two of these,
[3499.82 → 3500.42] but not Tomb Raider,
[3500.56 → 3500.72] okay,
[3500.78 → 3501.30] not Tomb Raider,
[3501.38 → 3501.84] not BF4.
[3502.02 → 3502.86] And in the gold tier,
[3503.02 → 3504.58] you can pick three of them,
[3504.70 → 3505.62] except not BF4.
[3506.28 → 3506.64] So,
[3507.64 → 3508.00] AMD,
[3508.34 → 3509.02] we love you.
[3509.20 → 3509.82] Thank you
[3509.82 → 3511.48] for giving us all the games.
[3512.12 → 3513.26] But your naming conventions
[3513.26 → 3515.84] and your little weird naming schemes
[3515.84 → 3517.48] and category things
[3517.48 → 3519.32] is not really working out.
[3520.96 → 3522.08] They asked me to settle.
[3522.08 → 3524.66] They asked me to settle
[3524.66 → 3525.68] for one game or two games.
[3525.68 → 3526.44] You know what got me too?
[3526.54 → 3527.30] Is we were talking about
[3527.30 → 3527.90] like the R9,
[3527.96 → 3528.84] R7 thing a bunch
[3528.84 → 3530.10] and how like certain ones
[3530.10 → 3530.88] should probably be moved
[3530.88 → 3531.78] into categories and stuff.
[3532.08 → 3533.88] Why isn't an R7 260X
[3533.88 → 3534.58] in the same category
[3534.58 → 3535.52] as an R7 240?
[3536.52 → 3536.96] Exactly.
[3537.78 → 3539.12] I agree with you 100%.
[3539.12 → 3539.88] What the hell?
[3540.38 → 3540.64] I mean,
[3540.68 → 3541.22] we love you, AMD.
[3541.30 → 3542.18] The graphics cards are great.
[3542.24 → 3542.74] We just wish you'd
[3542.74 → 3543.46] called them something else.
[3543.60 → 3544.44] And the other thing too
[3544.44 → 3545.34] is the whole never settle
[3545.34 → 3547.02] and we're better at game bundles' thing
[3547.02 → 3549.30] feels a little bit hollow
[3549.30 → 3550.68] when NVIDIA is doing
[3550.68 → 3551.80] their holiday promotion,
[3552.36 → 3553.34] which is...
[3553.34 → 3553.94] Beast is all hell.
[3554.16 → 3554.44] Yeah.
[3555.08 → 3556.38] Assassin's Creed Black Flag,
[3556.74 → 3558.04] Splinter Cell Blacklist,
[3558.16 → 3558.64] Black Light,
[3558.78 → 3559.28] Blacklist.
[3559.40 → 3559.60] List.
[3560.02 → 3560.42] Blacklist.
[3560.68 → 3561.96] And then Batman Arkham Origins
[3561.96 → 3562.74] on the higher tier card.
[3562.74 → 3563.14] So you're getting
[3563.14 → 3564.02] two to three games.
[3564.18 → 3566.86] So for 290X versus 780,
[3567.16 → 3567.92] hold on a minute.
[3568.34 → 3569.84] You might get Battlefield 4
[3569.84 → 3571.58] or you will get
[3571.58 → 3572.40] these three games
[3572.40 → 3573.38] that are also compelling
[3573.38 → 3574.16] and you will get
[3574.16 → 3576.72] $100 off of a shield,
[3576.86 → 3577.32] which is also
[3577.32 → 3578.48] a compelling experience.
[3579.02 → 3579.54] So it's like,
[3579.72 → 3580.74] mere, now we're settling.
[3580.74 → 3581.52] But then Mantle.
[3582.00 → 3582.86] But then Mantle, so...
[3582.86 → 3584.62] 20 to 50% more performance,
[3584.72 → 3584.92] potentially.
[3584.92 → 3585.84] But then maybe Mantle's
[3585.84 → 3586.36] on NVIDIA.
[3586.50 → 3587.54] But then power consumption
[3587.54 → 3588.22] and noise.
[3588.96 → 3590.48] But then maybe NVIDIA's gonna...
[3590.48 → 3591.60] And then what if you want G-Sync?
[3591.60 → 3592.38] It's a great time
[3592.38 → 3593.34] to buy a graphics card.
[3593.68 → 3594.28] Because it's hard
[3594.28 → 3595.26] to make a wrong decision
[3595.26 → 3596.56] because they're just
[3596.56 → 3597.32] all going to be awesome.
[3597.68 → 3598.64] Yeah, pretty much.
[3599.38 → 3600.68] Alright, so this is
[3600.68 → 3601.88] something that's actually
[3601.88 → 3602.64] going to be a bit of
[3602.64 → 3603.54] a quick topic here.
[3603.62 → 3605.08] But speaking of Microsoft,
[3605.82 → 3607.32] we actually talked about
[3607.32 → 3608.62] their stupid publicity stunt
[3608.62 → 3609.96] where they put a giant Xbox One
[3609.96 → 3611.20] in a parking lot in Vancouver.
[3611.56 → 3612.28] Here's another one.
[3612.48 → 3613.00] Oh my...
[3613.00 → 3614.34] You piece of garbage.
[3614.74 → 3615.94] Okay, so...
[3615.94 → 3617.50] They're putting an Xbox One
[3617.50 → 3618.18] in New Zealand.
[3618.18 → 3621.68] So whoever gets this Xbox One,
[3621.76 → 3622.40] the lucky winner,
[3622.80 → 3623.52] will get to be...
[3623.52 → 3624.58] I'm just going to turn the volume off
[3624.58 → 3625.54] because I have no idea
[3625.54 → 3626.62] how loud it is.
[3626.74 → 3627.68] I'm sorry in advance.
[3628.22 → 3629.54] How is this not working?
[3630.56 → 3631.20] How is it not working?
[3631.46 → 3631.84] There you go.
[3632.64 → 3633.00] Anyway...
[3633.00 → 3633.64] While we're here,
[3633.82 → 3635.10] I'm a kite-Calvinist.
[3635.24 → 3635.50] Let's find a shark.
[3636.14 → 3637.12] Because I want sharks
[3637.12 → 3638.26] with frickin' laser beams
[3638.26 → 3639.22] attached to their heads.
[3639.40 → 3640.52] How complicated is this?
[3640.52 → 3642.46] So the first person in the world
[3642.46 → 3643.84] to get an Xbox One
[3643.84 → 3645.20] will be someone in New Zealand
[3645.20 → 3646.28] who wins this one
[3646.28 → 3647.36] that they're actually putting
[3647.36 → 3648.42] into a shark tank
[3648.42 → 3649.06] that has something like
[3649.06 → 3649.96] 20 sharks in it.
[3650.00 → 3650.78] So it's like...
[3650.78 → 3652.28] Not a trivial number of sharks.
[3654.14 → 3654.98] I think that's really
[3654.98 → 3656.14] all there is to say about it.
[3656.24 → 3657.66] Yeah, it's...
[3657.66 → 3658.68] I mean, other than all the press
[3658.68 → 3659.14] who have them.
[3659.32 → 3659.54] Yeah.
[3659.80 → 3660.06] Even...
[3660.06 → 3660.48] Well...
[3660.48 → 3660.64] Yeah.
[3660.64 → 3660.80] Yeah.
[3660.98 → 3661.86] Even in the video,
[3661.98 → 3662.36] they're like,
[3662.44 → 3663.02] oh, well,
[3663.12 → 3663.56] we don't know
[3663.56 → 3664.50] who's going to go get it.
[3666.78 → 3667.76] I'm assuming it's going to be
[3667.76 → 3668.34] the same divers
[3668.34 → 3669.26] that went down to put it in,
[3669.32 → 3670.22] but it was just kind of funny.
[3670.22 → 3670.92] Yeah, I mean,
[3671.02 → 3671.80] it'd be...
[3671.80 → 3672.14] You know,
[3672.24 → 3673.44] what a liability problem
[3673.44 → 3674.08] that would be
[3674.08 → 3675.26] if someone actually, like,
[3675.30 → 3675.74] went in there
[3675.74 → 3676.38] and tried to get it
[3676.38 → 3676.84] and died.
[3677.78 → 3678.64] It'd be pretty epic, though.
[3678.64 → 3679.36] And if there was anywhere
[3679.36 → 3680.14] where that would happen,
[3680.20 → 3680.94] it would be down under.
[3682.82 → 3684.12] I mean,
[3684.16 → 3685.34] I think Australians
[3685.34 → 3686.28] and New Zealanders
[3686.28 → 3686.78] would be the first
[3686.78 → 3688.32] to admit that.
[3688.42 → 3688.70] I know,
[3688.78 → 3689.66] but just last week
[3689.66 → 3690.54] attacking the sheep
[3690.54 → 3691.74] and then now
[3691.74 → 3692.86] calling them crazy.
[3692.98 → 3694.06] Well, I love those guys.
[3695.00 → 3695.80] Okay, think about it
[3695.80 → 3696.52] this way, you guys.
[3696.52 → 3697.24] The time slot
[3697.24 → 3697.68] that we have
[3697.68 → 3698.38] for the WAN show,
[3698.50 → 3699.36] have we not demonstrated
[3699.36 → 3699.90] we love you?
[3699.90 → 3700.86] I think Australia
[3700.86 → 3701.60] and New Zealand
[3701.60 → 3702.42] actually have the best
[3702.42 → 3702.94] time slot
[3702.94 → 3703.60] for the WAN show.
[3703.60 → 3703.86] Yeah.
[3704.16 → 3705.14] Our own time zone
[3705.14 → 3708.32] gets the bone.
[3708.32 → 3708.62] It's terrible
[3708.62 → 3709.68] because it's like
[3709.68 → 3711.02] starts at 4.30
[3711.02 → 3711.66] when everyone's
[3711.66 → 3712.24] still at work.
[3712.48 → 3713.10] Yeah, I know, right?
[3713.50 → 3713.88] It's like
[3713.88 → 3715.14] Timmy Tech TV
[3715.14 → 3715.70] was like,
[3716.14 → 3716.84] hey Linus,
[3716.92 → 3717.70] I can never
[3717.70 → 3718.78] watch your show anymore.
[3719.28 → 3719.74] It's like,
[3719.82 → 3720.28] I thought we were
[3720.28 → 3720.96] friends, Ben.
[3721.90 → 3722.30] Just like,
[3722.36 → 3722.96] sorry, dude.
[3723.56 → 3723.98] All right,
[3723.98 → 3725.18] so this last topic
[3725.18 → 3726.14] before the Twitter blitz.
[3726.44 → 3727.68] What is it doing?
[3727.94 → 3728.62] I don't know.
[3729.16 → 3730.04] Look at what I'm doing.
[3730.16 → 3730.98] I like touch here
[3730.98 → 3731.70] and I try to scroll
[3731.70 → 3732.68] and just like change
[3732.68 → 3732.76] to tabs.
[3732.76 → 3734.36] Are you swiping left
[3734.36 → 3735.22] maybe if it goes?
[3736.48 → 3737.48] No, no, no.
[3737.68 → 3738.18] I thought that might
[3738.18 → 3738.64] have been a thing.
[3738.82 → 3739.22] Unbelievable.
[3739.22 → 3740.36] Okay, so Samsung
[3740.36 → 3740.90] and Intel
[3740.90 → 3742.44] find 36 more companies
[3742.44 → 3743.60] to back Wizen.
[3743.60 → 3745.14] You selected all of this
[3745.14 → 3746.56] by swiping left and forward.
[3746.64 → 3747.36] Well, that's ridiculous.
[3747.58 → 3748.46] Left and right there.
[3748.56 → 3749.06] Oh, I hate it.
[3749.32 → 3749.56] All right,
[3749.68 → 3750.60] so Samsung and Intel
[3750.60 → 3752.02] find 36 more companies
[3752.02 → 3752.78] to back Wizen,
[3752.90 → 3754.18] their Android competitor.
[3755.26 → 3756.40] So it's an open-based,
[3756.58 → 3757.22] Linux-based,
[3757.40 → 3758.10] open-based,
[3758.22 → 3758.82] open-source,
[3758.96 → 3759.50] Linux-based,
[3759.50 → 3760.44] you know what,
[3760.44 → 3761.34] I should just leave.
[3761.52 → 3762.00] Open-source,
[3762.10 → 3763.48] Linux-based operating system.
[3763.66 → 3764.24] It's got some
[3764.24 → 3765.08] interesting backers,
[3765.16 → 3766.02] so the new companies
[3766.02 → 3766.88] backing it includes
[3766.88 → 3767.28] eBay,
[3767.80 → 3768.32] Donati,
[3768.32 → 3769.50] McAfee,
[3769.66 → 3770.22] Panasonic,
[3770.40 → 3771.26] and the Weather Channel.
[3771.38 → 3772.24] So if I've ever seen
[3772.24 → 3773.88] a ragtag group of companies
[3773.88 → 3775.40] to band together
[3775.40 → 3776.68] and support something,
[3776.82 → 3777.18] that, yeah.
[3777.40 → 3778.26] Which is confusing.
[3778.50 → 3779.70] Which is like Intel again
[3779.70 → 3781.56] because McAfee is owned by Intel.
[3783.68 → 3784.16] Okay,
[3784.48 → 3785.44] so some of the cool things
[3785.44 → 3785.74] about it.
[3785.76 → 3786.66] It'll allow developers
[3786.66 → 3787.62] to work in CSS,
[3787.96 → 3788.92] HTML5,
[3788.92 → 3789.66] and JavaScript,
[3789.96 → 3791.00] which is interesting,
[3791.14 → 3792.98] but it's not a security issue.
[3793.42 → 3793.94] Kind of weird, yeah.
[3794.06 → 3795.68] Yeah, it's like kind of random
[3795.68 → 3796.90] and seems to open up a lot,
[3796.90 → 3798.02] open up more doors
[3798.02 → 3798.62] than it closes,
[3798.86 → 3799.54] so to speak.
[3800.14 → 3801.16] Performance has been
[3801.16 → 3802.02] shown off before,
[3802.30 → 3803.50] and if I had my other laptop,
[3803.66 → 3804.90] I would play this YouTube video
[3804.90 → 3805.48] for you,
[3805.56 → 3806.18] but, uh...
[3806.18 → 3806.56] They just,
[3806.84 → 3807.40] they, like,
[3807.62 → 3808.48] look at a gallery
[3808.48 → 3809.94] which uses all the
[3809.94 → 3811.30] most useless possible things,
[3811.36 → 3811.96] like putting pictures
[3811.96 → 3812.50] on a cube,
[3812.88 → 3813.92] and then they call someone.
[3814.78 → 3815.82] Okay, yes.
[3815.88 → 3816.60] And I know it's like,
[3816.64 → 3817.56] how do you show it off,
[3817.62 → 3818.44] but like, dude...
[3818.44 → 3819.68] It's on crappy hardware,
[3819.82 → 3819.98] though.
[3820.08 → 3821.40] So Samsung showed it off
[3821.40 → 3822.00] on something like
[3822.00 → 3823.16] a Galaxy S2,
[3823.16 → 3824.38] and they were doing
[3824.38 → 3825.38] some cool...
[3825.38 → 3825.68] I mean,
[3825.74 → 3826.42] the cool thing about it
[3826.42 → 3826.80] was that it was
[3826.80 → 3828.30] an HTML5-based app
[3828.30 → 3829.78] as opposed to being...
[3829.78 → 3830.36] I think they both were.
[3830.42 → 3831.60] I think even the calling was.
[3832.10 → 3832.40] So,
[3832.50 → 3833.52] so that's really neat.
[3833.76 → 3834.02] Um,
[3834.58 → 3836.30] is this going to
[3836.30 → 3837.50] topple the mighty
[3837.50 → 3838.18] Google empire?
[3838.44 → 3838.70] No.
[3841.38 → 3842.40] One thing that I noticed
[3842.40 → 3843.24] was with the companies
[3843.24 → 3843.90] that backed it.
[3844.00 → 3844.98] Sorry to cut you off there.
[3845.04 → 3845.18] No,
[3845.28 → 3846.18] I wasn't talking anymore.
[3846.26 → 3846.80] I just said no.
[3847.00 → 3847.14] Yeah.
[3847.34 → 3847.66] That was it.
[3847.70 → 3848.02] I was done.
[3848.18 → 3848.74] One thing I noticed
[3848.74 → 3849.40] about the companies
[3849.40 → 3850.44] that are backing it
[3850.44 → 3850.78] are...
[3850.78 → 3851.60] They're all companies
[3851.60 → 3853.34] that Google is basically
[3853.34 → 3855.22] trying to just circumvent
[3855.22 → 3855.76] and being like,
[3855.84 → 3856.02] nope,
[3856.12 → 3857.02] this is our own thing.
[3857.28 → 3857.54] Like,
[3857.60 → 3858.20] the Weather Channel.
[3858.56 → 3859.44] Google's kind of
[3859.44 → 3860.26] doing their own thing.
[3860.38 → 3860.54] Yep.
[3860.82 → 3861.22] McAfee,
[3861.32 → 3861.88] they're kind of
[3861.88 → 3862.54] starting to bundle
[3862.54 → 3863.24] their own thing.
[3863.76 → 3864.00] Like,
[3864.10 → 3865.66] it's all stuff
[3865.66 → 3866.76] that Google is
[3866.76 → 3867.64] trying to get rid of,
[3867.70 → 3868.22] so they're all like,
[3868.32 → 3868.50] oh,
[3868.58 → 3869.08] maybe we should
[3869.08 → 3870.24] back this thing over here.
[3870.48 → 3871.48] It is kind of like...
[3871.48 → 3872.58] But it isn't going to work.
[3873.16 → 3874.26] I'm a lot more interested
[3874.26 → 3875.58] in something like Ubuntu Phone.
[3876.12 → 3876.92] I actually...
[3876.92 → 3877.32] You know what?
[3877.38 → 3878.50] I actually just cleared this
[3878.50 → 3879.68] with Brandon
[3879.68 → 3880.76] and I'm going to borrow
[3880.76 → 3881.72] his Galaxy Nexus
[3881.72 → 3883.00] because that happens
[3883.00 → 3884.26] to be one of the two phones.
[3884.60 → 3884.82] No, no,
[3884.86 → 3885.80] I'm going to finish...
[3885.80 → 3886.36] Oh, his last one.
[3886.40 → 3886.92] Yeah, his old.
[3886.96 → 3887.98] Yeah, his Galaxy Nexus.
[3888.10 → 3888.74] So I'm going to finish
[3888.74 → 3889.84] my Nexus 5 review
[3889.84 → 3891.02] and then as long as
[3891.02 → 3891.86] nothing else arrives,
[3891.96 → 3892.64] I'm going to...
[3892.64 → 3893.36] Man, guys,
[3894.12 → 3895.56] Peria Z1 and Nexus 5
[3895.56 → 3896.48] are really making me
[3896.48 → 3897.44] miss my HTC One.
[3897.54 → 3898.54] I can't wait to get it back.
[3898.62 → 3899.30] I'm actually going to throw
[3899.30 → 3900.30] a Cyanogen mod on it,
[3900.38 → 3900.68] hopefully,
[3901.20 → 3902.16] as long as I can get
[3902.16 → 3903.38] everything sufficiently unlocked
[3903.38 → 3903.94] because I don't have
[3903.94 → 3904.84] a Play Store Edition one.
[3905.82 → 3906.08] Oh.
[3906.34 → 3906.62] So,
[3906.80 → 3907.08] but,
[3907.30 → 3908.48] I have an early...
[3908.50 → 3909.30] early developer one,
[3909.46 → 3910.44] my original one.
[3911.30 → 3911.54] Oh.
[3911.88 → 3912.74] So that might be...
[3912.74 → 3913.26] I don't know.
[3913.48 → 3913.80] Anyway,
[3914.00 → 3915.64] so I'm going to ask
[3915.64 → 3916.40] Brandon to let me
[3916.40 → 3917.30] borrow his Galaxy Nexus
[3917.30 → 3917.80] and I'm going to try
[3917.80 → 3918.28] Ubuntu phone.
[3918.96 → 3920.78] I'll do like a 30-day book.
[3920.88 → 3921.74] I'll give this a shot.
[3921.76 → 3922.74] You have to remember
[3922.74 → 3924.16] that it's going to be slow
[3924.16 → 3924.88] and the battery life's
[3924.88 → 3925.58] not going to be like it
[3925.58 → 3926.20] and it's not going to be
[3926.20 → 3926.70] Ubuntu's fault.
[3926.74 → 3926.94] I know,
[3927.12 → 3928.50] but I just want to try it.
[3928.56 → 3929.04] I want to be like,
[3929.10 → 3929.60] okay, well, look,
[3929.70 → 3930.76] if I want to play Pac-Man,
[3930.86 → 3931.16] can I?
[3931.74 → 3932.68] Those kinds of things.
[3932.72 → 3934.02] If I want to check the weather,
[3934.14 → 3934.46] can I?
[3934.78 → 3936.06] So I find that very exciting.
[3936.42 → 3936.64] I mean,
[3936.64 → 3939.26] Ubuntu has the resources
[3939.26 → 3940.98] and they have the track record
[3940.98 → 3943.62] of delivering free operating systems
[3943.62 → 3944.70] for better or for worse
[3944.70 → 3945.86] and getting support
[3945.86 → 3947.38] and building a business.
[3947.38 → 3948.02] And the improvements
[3948.02 → 3948.82] that they've been doing
[3948.82 → 3952.28] and like the mass consumer usability
[3952.28 → 3952.80] of Linux
[3952.80 → 3955.00] that Ubuntu has been spearheading
[3955.00 → 3955.50] for a while
[3955.50 → 3956.20] has been perfect.
[3956.20 → 3958.06] They claim to be the OS
[3958.06 → 3959.66] on 10% of new PCs
[3959.66 → 3960.50] shipping today.
[3961.68 → 3962.30] That's unbelievable.
[3962.44 → 3963.26] Well, it's not North America.
[3963.66 → 3964.46] But overall,
[3964.58 → 3964.92] I don't care.
[3964.92 → 3966.24] North America, whatever.
[3966.90 → 3967.92] I'm just saying
[3967.92 → 3969.10] that's why it's probably
[3969.10 → 3969.74] so unbelievable.
[3969.86 → 3970.96] Yeah, that's extremely exciting.
[3971.22 → 3972.30] That's extremely exciting.
[3972.48 → 3972.64] Yeah.
[3972.94 → 3973.88] So let's go ahead
[3973.88 → 3974.50] and head over
[3974.50 → 3976.04] to the Twitter boards.
[3976.60 → 3977.20] Someone says,
[3977.36 → 3977.78] get Mood bot
[3977.78 → 3978.48] or any bot in chat.
[3978.52 → 3979.08] We had Mood bot.
[3979.14 → 3979.70] It was a big problem.
[3979.90 → 3981.74] It's a huge problem.
[3981.80 → 3981.94] Yeah.
[3982.02 → 3982.84] About the smart fridge,
[3982.90 → 3983.54] how about implementing
[3983.54 → 3984.96] RFID tags on products
[3984.96 → 3985.56] which will hold data
[3985.56 → 3986.16] like expired data
[3986.16 → 3986.50] and ingredients?
[3986.76 → 3987.12] Absolutely.
[3987.30 → 3988.60] That would be amazing.
[3989.68 → 3990.38] Huge deal.
[3990.48 → 3991.46] Or even like if you,
[3991.56 → 3992.52] okay, think about this.
[3992.52 → 3994.62] If you could like to grab apples
[3994.62 → 3995.24] or something
[3995.24 → 3996.36] and instead of
[3996.36 → 3997.48] the traditional twist tie,
[3997.68 → 3999.30] you can bring your own thing
[3999.30 → 4001.10] of RFID twist ties.
[4001.28 → 4002.16] You tie it up
[4002.16 → 4002.74] and they have a little
[4002.74 → 4003.42] programmer there.
[4003.68 → 4004.64] Or you use your phone
[4004.64 → 4005.20] or something
[4005.20 → 4005.84] and you just go
[4005.84 → 4006.78] buying apples today.
[4006.86 → 4007.12] Book.
[4007.26 → 4007.48] Yeah.
[4007.62 → 4008.82] And like anything
[4008.82 → 4009.78] that's like that
[4009.78 → 4010.62] you could do with your phone
[4010.62 → 4011.60] or your own little twist tie
[4011.60 → 4012.58] or whatever you just brought up.
[4012.84 → 4013.70] And then like milk,
[4013.82 → 4014.58] it could just be programmed
[4014.58 → 4015.42] into the barcode
[4015.42 → 4016.16] on the milk.
[4016.52 → 4016.80] Like it's,
[4017.28 → 4017.60] and then,
[4017.60 → 4018.40] and then with
[4018.40 → 4019.94] coupled with the Amazon thing,
[4020.10 → 4021.34] the day your milk expires,
[4021.34 → 4022.24] some dude could show up
[4022.24 → 4022.86] with milk and be like,
[4022.88 → 4024.20] yep, throw your old milk away.
[4024.34 → 4024.78] Here's new milk.
[4024.80 → 4025.52] Wouldn't that be amazing?
[4025.68 → 4026.02] It'd be awesome.
[4026.86 → 4027.80] Zodiac Soulmates
[4027.80 → 4029.42] has ASUS just teased
[4029.42 → 4030.60] the Mars 760.
[4031.06 → 4031.32] Yeah.
[4031.74 → 4032.48] Could it be something
[4032.48 → 4033.02] about any of these
[4033.02 → 4033.54] Kepler licensed
[4033.54 → 4034.36] to other manufacturers?
[4034.54 → 4035.32] No, no, I don't think so.
[4035.34 → 4036.06] I think it's just
[4036.06 → 4036.62] one of those things
[4036.62 → 4037.66] where these dual GPU cards
[4037.66 → 4038.94] don't sell particularly well
[4038.94 → 4039.56] and the engineering
[4039.56 → 4040.28] that goes into them
[4040.28 → 4041.52] is unbelievable.
[4042.38 → 4043.20] The cost of it,
[4043.32 → 4044.58] like ASUS loses money
[4044.58 → 4045.92] on every Mars card,
[4046.04 → 4046.58] 100%.
[4046.58 → 4047.30] Trust me,
[4047.52 → 4047.82] they do.
[4048.00 → 4048.96] Wouldn't be surprised at all.
[4049.04 → 4049.34] They do.
[4049.50 → 4049.66] I mean,
[4049.70 → 4050.32] the amount of money
[4050.32 → 4051.68] that it took to even build
[4051.68 → 4053.12] the stupid heat sink
[4053.12 → 4053.90] on Ares 2.
[4054.28 → 4055.20] The amount of revisions
[4055.20 → 4055.70] they did
[4055.70 → 4056.96] to even tool that thing.
[4057.08 → 4057.94] Like, they lost money.
[4058.02 → 4058.38] It was a totally
[4058.38 → 4059.30] money-losing proposition.
[4059.78 → 4060.60] Mars 760
[4060.60 → 4062.06] is a similar.
[4062.22 → 4062.60] So that's why
[4062.60 → 4063.24] no one does it.
[4063.42 → 4064.32] We actually have one coming.
[4064.72 → 4064.96] Cool.
[4065.18 → 4065.38] Yeah.
[4065.76 → 4066.42] It's interesting.
[4066.94 → 4067.68] Good work, Linus.
[4067.68 → 4068.06] It's interesting.
[4068.32 → 4068.90] Have you seen, like,
[4068.94 → 4069.94] the concept photos
[4069.94 → 4070.46] for the...
[4070.46 → 4071.02] No, I haven't even seen it.
[4071.12 → 4071.98] No, not for this.
[4072.06 → 4073.40] For, uh...
[4073.40 → 4075.08] It's fake.
[4075.42 → 4075.94] I'm, like,
[4076.00 → 4076.60] 99% sure.
[4076.60 → 4076.62] Oh, we have an image
[4076.62 → 4077.48] for black coming, too.
[4077.96 → 4078.36] Oh, cool.
[4078.46 → 4079.28] That's actually pretty cool.
[4079.28 → 4080.60] Um, but yeah,
[4080.72 → 4081.90] someone leaked
[4081.90 → 4083.20] concept photos
[4083.20 → 4083.98] for a dual
[4083.98 → 4085.64] 290X GPU card.
[4085.82 → 4086.12] Oh, yeah.
[4086.42 → 4086.98] And they just, like,
[4087.04 → 4087.80] added a fan
[4087.80 → 4088.72] to a 7990.
[4089.12 → 4089.66] And it's, like,
[4089.74 → 4090.60] super long.
[4090.96 → 4091.50] Ha ha ha.
[4092.18 → 4092.86] I was like,
[4092.90 → 4093.60] there's no way.
[4093.70 → 4094.14] There's, like,
[4094.18 → 4095.36] one case that they can fit in.
[4095.36 → 4096.22] That card would have
[4096.22 → 4096.98] to be liquid cool.
[4097.14 → 4098.56] Like, dual rad liquid cool.
[4098.70 → 4099.30] Yeah, they have
[4099.30 → 4100.36] four fans on it.
[4100.50 → 4101.64] I'm like, okay.
[4102.36 → 4103.08] Just upgraded
[4103.08 → 4104.18] to a 4770K
[4104.18 → 4105.10] from a Pentium 4.
[4105.10 → 4106.16] Good work, Andrew.
[4106.36 → 4106.64] Nice.
[4106.76 → 4107.36] Enjoy that.
[4107.36 → 4108.26] Do you think that
[4108.26 → 4109.24] smartphones would become
[4109.24 → 4109.88] the new laptop?
[4110.30 → 4110.58] Um,
[4111.18 → 4112.46] if wireless standards,
[4112.58 → 4113.26] like what Wendell's
[4113.26 → 4113.86] talking about,
[4113.92 → 4114.76] with docking stations
[4114.76 → 4115.48] become a thing,
[4115.56 → 4116.22] and something like
[4116.22 → 4117.08] Ubuntu phone?
[4118.36 → 4118.80] Maybe.
[4119.22 → 4120.02] Yeah, because with
[4120.02 → 4120.60] Ubuntu phone,
[4120.68 → 4121.14] you dock and it
[4121.14 → 4122.20] turns into a full OS.
[4122.26 → 4122.88] And if we can have
[4122.88 → 4124.28] Steam running on it,
[4124.34 → 4124.82] all of a sudden
[4124.82 → 4126.10] we can game on it,
[4126.14 → 4126.58] and more like
[4126.58 → 4127.52] a desktop experience,
[4127.70 → 4128.30] I think the future
[4128.30 → 4129.00] is very exciting.
[4129.32 → 4129.48] Yeah.
[4129.48 → 4130.52] What do you think
[4130.52 → 4131.48] about famous YouTubers
[4131.48 → 4132.40] like Total Biscuit
[4132.40 → 4133.54] disabling YouTube comments?
[4133.70 → 4134.82] I think that it's great
[4134.82 → 4135.36] that they're trying
[4135.36 → 4136.02] to send a message
[4136.02 → 4137.14] to Google and YouTube.
[4137.46 → 4138.48] I think that Google
[4138.48 → 4138.92] and YouTube
[4138.92 → 4141.08] probably have some idea
[4141.08 → 4142.42] that it's a problem
[4142.42 → 4143.16] at this point.
[4143.70 → 4144.62] One thing that's interesting
[4144.62 → 4145.64] is Unbox Therapy
[4145.64 → 4146.48] somehow has the old
[4146.48 → 4147.04] comment system
[4147.04 → 4147.66] on his channel.
[4148.22 → 4149.48] And he has a Facebook post.
[4149.56 → 4150.64] The only YouTube channel
[4150.64 → 4151.56] that still has
[4151.56 → 4152.34] the old comment system.
[4152.48 → 4153.38] I don't know how he did it,
[4153.52 → 4153.84] but...
[4153.84 → 4154.36] That's awesome.
[4154.48 → 4155.78] I suspect he won't even tell me
[4155.78 → 4156.96] because it's just like
[4156.96 → 4158.02] a trade secret or something.
[4158.02 → 4158.90] Or maybe he just like
[4158.90 → 4160.34] luckily didn't get bumped.
[4160.64 → 4162.12] I don't even know what it is.
[4162.16 → 4162.52] But anyway,
[4162.96 → 4164.00] I think it's important
[4164.00 → 4164.92] that they're sending a message
[4164.92 → 4165.52] and that's cool.
[4165.64 → 4167.16] I think YouTube and Google know
[4167.16 → 4168.36] and they'll do something.
[4168.82 → 4170.02] And for me personally,
[4170.24 → 4171.44] I don't see the difference
[4171.44 → 4173.14] between disabled comments
[4173.14 → 4174.76] and spam comments
[4174.76 → 4175.52] that we can just all
[4175.52 → 4176.06] not look at.
[4176.92 → 4177.24] I...
[4177.24 → 4177.66] Ugh.
[4177.82 → 4178.92] I hate the new comment system.
[4179.14 → 4179.70] But the main reason
[4179.70 → 4180.72] why I hate the new comment system
[4180.72 → 4181.86] is when you see the top dude,
[4181.94 → 4183.68] it's like 300 comments
[4183.68 → 4184.32] on his post.
[4184.32 → 4185.38] They can fix it
[4185.38 → 4186.58] so easily though.
[4186.72 → 4188.14] There are things that they can do.
[4188.80 → 4189.94] And it can be better.
[4190.92 → 4192.16] So let's just...
[4192.16 → 4193.74] Let's just give them a chance.
[4194.38 → 4195.60] And I'm not going to hurt
[4195.60 → 4196.70] my own search rankings
[4196.70 → 4197.54] to send a message
[4197.54 → 4198.40] to Google and YouTube
[4198.40 → 4199.22] that they already know.
[4199.24 → 4199.78] It's not going to change anything.
[4199.92 → 4200.52] Like people...
[4200.52 → 4201.22] Someone said,
[4201.36 → 4202.50] you should disable it
[4202.50 → 4203.18] and let people talk about it
[4203.18 → 4203.54] on the forum.
[4203.82 → 4204.88] Okay, go talk about it
[4204.88 → 4205.22] on the forum.
[4205.54 → 4206.20] I would love for you
[4206.20 → 4206.88] to go talk about it on the forum.
[4206.90 → 4207.56] Yeah, we'd love to drive
[4207.56 → 4208.14] more people to the forum.
[4208.14 → 4208.42] More interactions on the forum is awesome.
[4208.42 → 4209.40] But the reality of it is
[4209.40 → 4210.48] is that YouTube comments
[4210.48 → 4212.62] are and I believe always will be
[4212.62 → 4213.92] the lowest common denominator
[4213.92 → 4215.44] people who aren't willing
[4215.44 → 4216.50] to go and talk about it
[4216.50 → 4216.88] on the forum.
[4217.04 → 4217.90] You can have a way more
[4217.90 → 4218.88] intelligent conversation
[4218.88 → 4219.90] about any of the videos
[4219.90 → 4220.96] we make on our forum.
[4221.36 → 4221.80] 100%.
[4221.80 → 4222.14] Okay?
[4222.28 → 4222.36] Period.
[4222.36 → 4222.96] And if you post...
[4222.96 → 4223.18] Period.
[4223.36 → 4224.00] If there's a problem
[4224.00 → 4224.50] with the video,
[4224.62 → 4225.84] like in a very recent video,
[4226.00 → 4226.78] if you post something
[4226.78 → 4227.56] like that on the forum,
[4227.64 → 4228.74] like I reply to those
[4228.74 → 4229.34] all the time.
[4229.52 → 4230.84] There's a reply under that one
[4230.84 → 4231.58] saying like,
[4231.68 → 4232.54] oh, this is what's wrong.
[4232.82 → 4233.84] This is what the change should be.
[4234.08 → 4234.84] No one saw it.
[4234.90 → 4235.62] No one liked it.
[4235.74 → 4236.60] The forum is the way
[4236.60 → 4237.66] to interact with us.
[4237.76 → 4238.32] People send me
[4238.32 → 4239.36] YouTube private messages.
[4239.52 → 4239.72] I'm like,
[4239.76 → 4240.58] what are you high?
[4240.90 → 4241.96] I get hundreds of them.
[4242.06 → 4243.06] I can't look at all of these.
[4243.14 → 4243.74] Whereas when I get
[4243.74 → 4244.88] private messages on the forum,
[4244.96 → 4245.98] I try to respond to them
[4245.98 → 4246.52] if there's something
[4246.52 → 4247.72] to be responded to.
[4247.80 → 4248.50] If it's just like,
[4248.84 → 4250.32] YOLO swag 420 Linus,
[4250.36 → 4251.04] I think you're awesome.
[4251.16 → 4251.52] I'll be like,
[4251.56 → 4252.02] yeah, okay, cool.
[4252.04 → 4252.22] If you have a user
[4252.22 → 4252.68] on the forum,
[4252.90 → 4255.00] YOLO swag 420 smoke it,
[4255.06 → 4255.24] I think.
[4255.64 → 4256.36] Every single time
[4256.36 → 4257.06] I see him post on anything,
[4257.10 → 4257.42] I'm just like,
[4257.56 → 4258.90] oh, my brain.
[4260.12 → 4260.82] Should I expect
[4260.82 → 4261.62] some sweet deals
[4261.62 → 4262.48] on new gen cards
[4262.48 → 4263.50] around Christmas this year?
[4263.60 → 4264.32] I would stay tuned
[4264.32 → 4265.14] for Black Friday.
[4265.68 → 4266.28] That's where you'll
[4266.28 → 4267.36] actually get the sweet deals.
[4267.36 → 4268.86] I've heard tons of rumours.
[4268.94 → 4269.14] I don't know
[4269.14 → 4269.80] if you've heard about this.
[4270.00 → 4271.20] Note 3 on Black Friday
[4271.20 → 4272.46] is supposed to like
[4272.46 → 4273.86] be super cheap.
[4274.08 → 4274.82] Huh, that's cool.
[4274.82 → 4274.90] Like,
[4275.38 → 4276.30] actually sensibly
[4276.30 → 4277.22] purchasable cheap.
[4277.68 → 4278.28] Which heat sink
[4278.28 → 4278.68] should I get
[4278.68 → 4279.90] with a Note 605?
[4280.30 → 4281.12] Noctua has a really
[4281.12 → 4282.16] nice low profile one
[4282.16 → 4282.80] that we will be
[4282.80 → 4283.58] unboxing soon
[4283.58 → 4284.24] and then installing
[4284.24 → 4285.12] in Easel's
[4285.12 → 4285.80] video editing rig.
[4286.52 → 4286.96] I forget what
[4286.96 → 4287.46] it's called though.
[4287.56 → 4287.96] L something.
[4288.84 → 4289.20] Basically,
[4289.34 → 4289.92] find the Noctua
[4289.92 → 4290.76] low profile one.
[4291.00 → 4291.12] Alright,
[4291.20 → 4292.18] this is my answer.
[4292.36 → 4293.22] What cooler should I get?
[4294.24 → 4295.14] Find the Noctua
[4295.14 → 4295.88] one that fits.
[4295.88 → 4297.62] Noctua did not
[4297.62 → 4298.66] pay me to say this.
[4299.12 → 4299.38] Although,
[4299.84 → 4300.46] I, uh,
[4300.50 → 4301.04] no, I'm not going
[4301.04 → 4301.54] to talk about that.
[4301.90 → 4302.22] Linus,
[4302.30 → 4302.78] what do you think
[4302.78 → 4303.50] of the PS4
[4303.50 → 4304.38] red line of death?
[4304.44 → 4305.22] I think that the
[4305.22 → 4306.32] rumours of its death
[4306.32 → 4306.94] have been greatly
[4306.94 → 4307.54] exaggerated.
[4308.58 → 4309.46] The number
[4309.46 → 4310.08] that's being thrown
[4310.08 → 4310.60] around right now
[4310.60 → 4311.60] is 0.4%,
[4311.60 → 4312.76] which is within
[4312.76 → 4313.32] reason.
[4313.32 → 4314.80] Not a huge deal.
[4314.98 → 4315.68] Any confirmation
[4315.68 → 4316.58] on Linus Edition
[4316.58 → 4317.46] Corsair fans?
[4317.56 → 4318.46] I have no plans
[4318.46 → 4319.48] for Corsair fans,
[4319.72 → 4320.56] Linus Edition fans.
[4321.02 → 4321.66] Would you rather
[4321.66 → 4322.22] eat a piece
[4322.22 → 4323.34] of year-old garlic bread
[4323.34 → 4324.94] or rub sriracha
[4324.94 → 4325.96] on your face
[4325.96 → 4326.84] and kiss slick?
[4327.32 → 4327.88] I've probably
[4327.88 → 4328.88] eaten year old
[4328.88 → 4329.74] garlic bread before,
[4329.84 → 4330.06] so I'm going
[4330.06 → 4330.56] to go with that.
[4332.66 → 4333.12] Hook up the
[4333.12 → 4333.78] graphics card
[4333.78 → 4334.32] cooling loop
[4334.32 → 4335.76] to an AC
[4335.76 → 4336.48] during winter
[4336.48 → 4337.32] equals winning.
[4338.00 → 4338.18] Um,
[4338.18 → 4338.54] you know what?
[4338.58 → 4339.24] I actually brought
[4339.24 → 4339.60] the chiller
[4339.60 → 4340.30] the other day.
[4340.58 → 4341.10] It's here now.
[4341.88 → 4342.34] You know,
[4342.40 → 4342.86] do you know anyone
[4342.86 → 4343.28] who can do
[4343.28 → 4343.86] metal fabrication?
[4344.50 → 4344.74] Yes.
[4345.24 → 4345.94] Let's get it done.
[4346.16 → 4347.42] It won't be cheap.
[4347.66 → 4347.80] Ah,
[4347.80 → 4348.12] that's fine.
[4348.20 → 4348.72] Let's get it done.
[4348.94 → 4349.92] Let's make an enclosure
[4349.92 → 4350.74] so that we can...
[4350.74 → 4350.94] I know someone
[4350.94 → 4351.48] who can make
[4351.48 → 4352.94] custom cases for us.
[4353.14 → 4353.28] Yes.
[4353.36 → 4354.16] Entire computer cases.
[4354.30 → 4354.52] Okay,
[4354.60 → 4355.56] let's get a case
[4355.56 → 4356.10] for the chiller.
[4356.36 → 4356.90] The challenge
[4356.90 → 4357.56] I had before
[4357.56 → 4358.50] was that I needed
[4358.50 → 4359.60] appropriate insulation
[4359.60 → 4360.62] on the tank
[4360.62 → 4361.96] for the cold side.
[4362.40 → 4363.28] That was the issue
[4363.28 → 4363.98] I had before,
[4364.12 → 4364.64] but if we could
[4364.64 → 4365.52] make a case for it,
[4365.54 → 4366.10] it would be heavy.
[4366.18 → 4366.70] We could put it
[4366.70 → 4367.30] on wheels though,
[4367.40 → 4368.48] but we need to get
[4368.48 → 4369.18] it self-contained
[4369.18 → 4369.76] because that's the only
[4369.76 → 4370.54] reason I don't use it.
[4370.54 → 4371.72] They can cat it for us
[4371.72 → 4372.06] and everything.
[4372.18 → 4372.36] Okay,
[4372.54 → 4372.94] let's do it.
[4373.02 → 4373.72] It won't be cheap.
[4374.48 → 4374.84] Okay,
[4374.90 → 4375.28] are we talking
[4375.28 → 4376.68] $10,000 not cheap
[4376.68 → 4377.18] or are we talking
[4377.18 → 4378.24] $1,000 not cheap?
[4378.32 → 4379.04] Probably like
[4379.04 → 4380.12] the lower one.
[4380.18 → 4380.38] Okay.
[4380.56 → 4381.64] I have no idea though.
[4382.32 → 4382.56] Um,
[4382.64 → 4382.90] hookah,
[4382.94 → 4383.18] okay,
[4383.30 → 4383.90] have you heard
[4383.90 → 4384.64] the alarm clock
[4384.64 → 4385.16] that tells you
[4385.16 → 4385.80] how long you've got
[4385.80 → 4386.48] left to live?
[4386.64 → 4386.92] No.
[4388.08 → 4388.76] That's awesome.
[4389.62 → 4390.28] Squarespace win
[4390.28 → 4391.16] a website event.
[4391.44 → 4392.22] Hashtag oh crap.
[4392.32 → 4392.42] Yeah,
[4392.44 → 4392.66] I know.
[4393.10 → 4393.70] What are your thoughts
[4393.70 → 4394.26] of the wallet
[4394.26 → 4395.48] replacement coin card?
[4395.56 → 4396.76] Haven't actually seen that.
[4397.62 → 4398.00] Interesting.
[4400.00 → 4400.90] I'm from New Zealand.
[4401.14 → 4401.78] I bet they hid
[4401.78 → 4403.04] the Xbox in Auckland.
[4403.62 → 4404.74] It's in the...
[4404.74 → 4404.92] Yeah,
[4404.96 → 4405.52] it's not hidden.
[4406.48 → 4406.92] Alright,
[4406.92 → 4408.66] so back to the show.
[4409.36 → 4410.64] The Humble store is up.
[4411.10 → 4412.10] This is pretty cool.
[4412.52 → 4413.48] This is both cool
[4413.48 → 4414.72] and it seems like
[4414.72 → 4415.44] sort of step
[4415.44 → 4416.08] in a direction
[4416.08 → 4417.04] that I don't want
[4417.04 → 4417.40] them to go.
[4417.64 → 4418.00] Yeah.
[4418.24 → 4418.64] Oh yeah.
[4418.74 → 4419.30] Like what the devil
[4419.30 → 4420.08] is this exactly?
[4420.40 → 4420.74] Um,
[4420.88 → 4421.66] fixed percentage
[4421.66 → 4423.48] of sales sharing
[4423.48 → 4424.04] at 10
[4424.04 → 4424.74] which is like
[4424.74 → 4426.06] whatever high.
[4426.46 → 4427.62] What just happened?
[4428.54 → 4430.02] What is this thing doing?
[4432.22 → 4433.20] It's taking inputs
[4433.20 → 4433.82] and it's not putting
[4433.82 → 4434.64] them to the right place.
[4435.14 → 4435.44] Well,
[4435.56 → 4436.82] it should stop that.
[4437.34 → 4437.94] Like...
[4437.94 → 4440.32] Okay.
[4440.60 → 4441.14] Why don't you just
[4441.14 → 4442.28] use a real browser?
[4442.90 → 4444.50] Why am I in that browser now?
[4444.74 → 4445.64] Where's the other one?
[4445.92 → 4446.50] I hate this.
[4446.52 → 4447.04] I saw you just
[4447.04 → 4447.56] open that one.
[4447.56 → 4448.48] I hate my life.
[4448.76 → 4449.10] Well,
[4449.10 → 4449.86] I don't hate my life.
[4449.94 → 4450.76] I just hate this.
[4451.92 → 4452.86] Just use a real...
[4452.86 → 4453.30] You've got it.
[4453.30 → 4453.54] Look,
[4453.66 → 4454.14] real browser.
[4454.14 → 4455.26] I know,
[4455.34 → 4456.44] but I have it open here
[4456.44 → 4457.68] and I'm logged in here.
[4457.70 → 4457.94] Okay,
[4458.00 → 4458.44] there we go.
[4458.58 → 4459.36] I don't even know
[4459.36 → 4459.82] what I did.
[4460.06 → 4460.18] Well,
[4460.22 → 4460.62] you dragged down
[4460.62 → 4460.96] from the top.
[4461.02 → 4461.84] Back to Humble Bundle.
[4461.92 → 4462.90] I'm trying to click on the...
[4462.90 → 4463.12] Okay.
[4463.30 → 4464.02] So the original
[4464.02 → 4465.06] Humble Bundle concept.
[4465.26 → 4465.42] Okay.
[4465.54 → 4466.24] Indie games.
[4466.90 → 4467.82] We want to support
[4467.82 → 4468.58] indie developers.
[4469.24 → 4470.22] You choose
[4470.22 → 4471.56] a charitable donation,
[4472.02 → 4472.98] money to give to the
[4472.98 → 4473.64] indie game dev,
[4473.72 → 4474.48] or money to give to
[4474.48 → 4475.42] the Humble Bundle organization.
[4475.42 → 4476.66] That was the original concept.
[4476.84 → 4476.98] Okay.
[4477.34 → 4477.74] Then,
[4477.82 → 4479.06] we got the Humble Weekly Sale,
[4479.32 → 4480.54] which is...
[4480.54 → 4481.56] whatever it is.
[4481.56 → 4482.60] It's basically an excuse
[4482.60 → 4483.48] to run two bundles
[4483.48 → 4484.08] at the same time,
[4484.12 → 4484.88] as far as I can tell.
[4484.88 → 4486.00] And then,
[4486.18 → 4486.90] the Humble Store,
[4487.20 → 4488.20] which is not bundles.
[4488.38 → 4489.30] It is games
[4489.30 → 4490.18] that you buy.
[4490.38 → 4491.44] And instead of choosing
[4491.44 → 4492.26] where the money goes,
[4492.42 → 4494.12] now it is 10% of the proceeds
[4494.12 → 4494.76] go to charity,
[4495.00 → 4495.18] period.
[4495.82 → 4497.20] Have we lost our way
[4497.20 → 4497.78] a little bit here?
[4498.68 → 4499.92] One thing about this
[4499.92 → 4500.92] is we never see
[4500.92 → 4502.80] big AAA new titles
[4502.80 → 4504.32] on the Humble Bundle.
[4504.34 → 4504.64] Okay.
[4504.82 → 4505.34] And this has
[4505.34 → 4506.46] Splinter Cell Blacklist.
[4506.48 → 4507.10] And this has
[4507.10 → 4508.20] some bigger games in it.
[4508.20 → 4508.50] A Red Faction Collection.
[4508.70 → 4510.06] Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon
[4510.06 → 4511.06] for like 10 bucks.
[4511.40 → 4512.58] It's like $5 off,
[4512.66 → 4513.80] which is like...
[4513.80 → 4514.38] It's a deal,
[4514.38 → 4515.70] but it's not that compelling.
[4515.94 → 4516.82] And why am I giving you
[4516.82 → 4517.70] 10% for this?
[4517.74 → 4518.26] I mean, basically,
[4518.32 → 4519.04] they're just leveraging
[4519.04 → 4520.22] the traffic that they got
[4520.22 → 4521.20] by being good guys
[4521.20 → 4522.02] and becoming
[4522.02 → 4522.96] a Steam competitor.
[4523.18 → 4524.82] They're still being good guys
[4524.82 → 4525.88] because there's 10% going
[4525.88 → 4526.74] and I think it would
[4526.74 → 4527.56] probably be harder
[4527.56 → 4528.58] to get developers
[4528.58 → 4530.36] to jump on the store idea.
[4530.78 → 4531.66] So that's probably
[4531.66 → 4532.64] where it has to go.
[4532.68 → 4533.36] They probably have to have
[4533.36 → 4534.28] slightly bigger margins
[4534.28 → 4535.48] because they probably have
[4535.48 → 4536.34] the people in the store
[4536.34 → 4537.04] taking more.
[4537.04 → 4538.04] They can probably promise
[4538.60 → 4539.18] the developer
[4539.18 → 4539.88] higher margin
[4539.88 → 4540.74] this way as well.
[4541.16 → 4542.38] Whereas Humble Bundle
[4542.38 → 4543.20] is just like,
[4543.28 → 4544.18] okay, free for all.
[4544.38 → 4545.36] But Humble Bundle
[4545.36 → 4546.20] has traditionally been
[4546.20 → 4547.06] either indie
[4547.06 → 4548.30] or if it's AAA,
[4548.50 → 4548.92] it's old.
[4549.02 → 4549.82] Like, my understanding
[4549.82 → 4550.54] is that EA
[4550.54 → 4552.80] had a lot of the contributions
[4552.80 → 4553.90] not go to EA
[4553.90 → 4555.34] as compared to other
[4555.34 → 4555.86] Humble Bundles.
[4555.94 → 4556.56] This is...
[4556.56 → 4557.24] I'm not going to say
[4557.24 → 4558.06] who I heard this from,
[4558.16 → 4558.90] but I heard it.
[4559.56 → 4561.54] So people were less inclined
[4561.54 → 4562.82] to give someone like EA money.
[4562.82 → 4563.96] What the stuff was in the EA bundle?
[4564.10 → 4565.50] The only really compelling thing
[4565.50 → 4566.28] was Battlefield 3
[4566.28 → 4567.30] and they were replacing it
[4567.30 → 4568.90] in like a month or two.
[4569.08 → 4570.16] But that's not the point.
[4570.16 → 4570.82] And they basically gave it away
[4570.82 → 4571.28] for free now.
[4571.30 → 4572.74] That's not even the point necessarily.
[4572.92 → 4574.30] I mean, the point is that
[4574.30 → 4576.06] people were willing
[4576.06 → 4577.40] to pay money for the game,
[4577.50 → 4578.14] they just weren't willing
[4578.14 → 4578.88] to give it to EA.
[4579.52 → 4581.00] Whereas if EA sells games
[4581.00 → 4581.92] through Humble Store,
[4582.02 → 4582.94] then at least they're guaranteed
[4582.94 → 4583.70] some kind of cut.
[4583.86 → 4584.06] Yeah.
[4584.54 → 4586.26] So I understand the business here.
[4586.32 → 4587.50] It just seems like...
[4587.50 → 4589.74] It just seems like
[4589.74 → 4591.00] they aren't what they used to be.
[4591.08 → 4592.32] So let's just be aware of that,
[4592.64 → 4593.36] which doesn't make
[4593.36 → 4594.92] Humble Bundles not a great deal.
[4595.26 → 4596.06] It just makes them
[4596.06 → 4596.88] not what they used to be.
[4596.94 → 4597.26] That's all.
[4597.50 → 4599.70] We have 5,000 live viewers right now.
[4599.82 → 4602.16] Guys, thank you for watching.
[4602.32 → 4603.02] That is amazing.
[4603.22 → 4603.82] You guys are awesome.
[4604.26 → 4604.56] That's all.
[4605.10 → 4605.48] All right.
[4605.88 → 4606.48] Let's...
[4608.04 → 4610.28] I want my laptop back.
[4610.48 → 4611.12] I don't know why
[4611.12 → 4612.56] my DisplayPort output isn't working.
[4614.06 → 4615.28] Okay.
[4615.68 → 4616.04] Anyway,
[4616.12 → 4617.18] do you want to go on another rant?
[4617.40 → 4618.28] You're talking about KitKat.
[4619.70 → 4620.42] No, no, no.
[4620.58 → 4621.44] No, you know what?
[4621.58 → 4621.94] Actually,
[4622.06 → 4623.68] my problems with Nexus 5 so far
[4623.68 → 4624.66] have nothing to do with KitKat.
[4625.10 → 4625.38] Oh.
[4625.46 → 4626.06] I like KitKat.
[4626.08 → 4626.46] Oh, okay.
[4626.64 → 4627.20] No, actually,
[4627.26 → 4628.36] all the things I'm going to bitch about
[4628.36 → 4629.40] are more to do with other stuff.
[4629.70 → 4629.90] Oh.
[4630.06 → 4631.48] So I have a review coming
[4631.48 → 4632.16] at the Nexus 5
[4632.16 → 4632.70] for those of you
[4632.70 → 4633.88] who don't follow me on Instagram,
[4634.06 → 4635.00] which I think is most of you.
[4635.86 → 4637.52] KitKat Android 4.4
[4637.52 → 4638.52] has a feature
[4638.52 → 4639.74] that will allow rooting
[4639.74 → 4641.34] to basically be disabled,
[4641.82 → 4643.06] which we've heard before.
[4643.06 → 4644.56] Yeah, rooting this is...
[4644.56 → 4645.44] Rooting's going away.
[4645.56 → 4646.12] Rooting...
[4646.12 → 4647.96] But it may actually be true this time.
[4648.16 → 4649.86] I wanted to talk with Wendell about this.
[4649.92 → 4650.90] Shoot, I meant to move this up
[4650.90 → 4651.54] to our guest segment.
[4651.64 → 4652.02] Yeah, I could see
[4652.02 → 4652.98] it's some fascinating input.
[4653.12 → 4654.26] I have read already
[4654.26 → 4655.16] that the Nexus 5
[4655.16 → 4655.72] is already rooted.
[4655.92 → 4656.16] Right.
[4656.40 → 4658.10] But this article,
[4658.26 → 4660.28] so the article on PC...
[4660.28 → 4661.70] PCMag.com...
[4661.70 → 4661.84] Okay.
[4662.12 → 4662.46] No.
[4662.62 → 4663.58] I don't want to sign up
[4663.58 → 4664.20] for your offers.
[4664.36 → 4664.68] Go away.
[4664.92 → 4665.20] All right.
[4665.20 → 4666.40] So there's a picture
[4666.40 → 4667.34] of an Android
[4667.34 → 4668.38] made of KitKat bars.
[4668.48 → 4669.12] I need food.
[4669.24 → 4670.20] I am so hungry.
[4670.38 → 4672.02] Like, my blood sugar is low
[4672.02 → 4672.78] and I shouldn't even
[4672.78 → 4673.66] be on the air right now.
[4674.76 → 4676.58] So what has been built
[4676.58 → 4678.78] into Android 4.4 KitKat
[4678.78 → 4679.34] essentially
[4679.34 → 4681.54] is the ability
[4681.54 → 4683.54] for a handset maker
[4683.54 → 4684.52] to block rooting.
[4684.70 → 4686.84] Now, there are security implications here.
[4686.92 → 4687.92] There are reasons
[4687.92 → 4689.48] why you wouldn't want
[4689.48 → 4690.72] root access to be available
[4690.72 → 4691.50] to just about anyone
[4691.50 → 4693.94] because rooting has become so easy
[4693.94 → 4695.62] that it's not even just
[4695.62 → 4696.76] for power users anymore
[4696.76 → 4697.64] that really understand
[4697.64 → 4698.66] the implications of it.
[4698.72 → 4700.12] Like, I'm not a power user
[4700.12 → 4701.08] when it comes to phones
[4701.08 → 4702.54] and when it comes to digital security,
[4702.90 → 4703.42] not really.
[4703.54 → 4705.32] I actually rely on him
[4705.32 → 4706.24] in a big way
[4706.24 → 4707.44] to support me
[4707.44 → 4707.82] and help me
[4707.82 → 4708.80] with these kinds of things
[4708.80 → 4710.80] because I know just enough
[4710.80 → 4711.36] to be dangerous
[4711.36 → 4713.12] and that is exactly
[4713.12 → 4714.38] what phone rooting can be.
[4714.66 → 4715.72] It can be just people
[4715.72 → 4716.64] who know just enough
[4716.64 → 4717.30] to be dangerous
[4717.30 → 4718.40] but don't know enough
[4718.40 → 4719.60] to know how to protect themselves
[4719.60 → 4720.64] and I'm not saying
[4720.64 → 4721.86] rooting should be taken away
[4721.86 → 4722.68] from the power users.
[4722.82 → 4723.36] I'm just saying
[4723.36 → 4724.58] that it's a can of worms.
[4725.00 → 4726.64] So, what they're going to allow
[4726.64 → 4727.70] is someone like Samsung
[4727.70 → 4729.20] who has been locking down
[4729.20 → 4730.52] functionality on their phones
[4730.52 → 4732.00] left and right
[4732.00 → 4733.26] to basically go,
[4733.38 → 4734.50] look, this phone is not bootable.
[4735.22 → 4735.44] Okay?
[4736.42 → 4738.56] Now, Google has not opted
[4738.56 → 4740.40] to make the Nexus 5 unbootable.
[4740.50 → 4741.62] In fact, there was a root for it
[4741.62 → 4742.42] before it was released
[4742.42 → 4743.20] and it's apparently
[4743.20 → 4744.20] phenomenally easy.
[4744.60 → 4745.74] So, I think they're doing
[4745.74 → 4746.58] a couple of things here.
[4746.66 → 4747.26] So, number one
[4747.26 → 4748.16] is they're positioning
[4748.16 → 4749.04] Nexus devices
[4749.04 → 4750.86] as the clear power user choice
[4750.86 → 4752.48] because I think they know
[4752.48 → 4753.66] that whatever they think
[4753.66 → 4754.12] about it,
[4754.22 → 4754.70] there's going to be
[4754.70 → 4755.50] certain handset makers
[4755.50 → 4756.00] that are going to want
[4756.00 → 4756.70] to lock this down.
[4757.14 → 4757.72] Number two
[4757.72 → 4760.30] is they are allowing Android
[4760.30 → 4761.38] to be potentially
[4761.38 → 4762.02] more secure
[4762.02 → 4763.58] on platforms
[4763.58 → 4765.88] where handset makers
[4765.88 → 4766.46] feel like they can
[4766.46 → 4767.04] get away with it.
[4767.50 → 4768.78] And so, Samsung.
[4769.32 → 4770.32] So, like Samsung.
[4770.52 → 4771.56] I think this is interesting
[4771.56 → 4772.74] for Cine gen Mod.
[4773.68 → 4773.86] Yeah.
[4773.86 → 4774.88] Because they just tried
[4774.88 → 4775.70] to be like,
[4775.82 → 4776.54] oh, hey, everyone,
[4776.54 → 4777.08] we're going to make
[4777.08 → 4777.76] that way easier
[4777.76 → 4778.30] implementation.
[4779.74 → 4780.34] We're going to make
[4780.34 → 4781.28] one click a thing.
[4781.42 → 4781.92] We're going to make
[4781.92 → 4782.86] all this other kind of stuff
[4782.86 → 4783.62] and then now
[4783.62 → 4784.62] Google's like,
[4784.72 → 4786.08] lol, here's this thing.
[4786.14 → 4786.54] Although they're not
[4786.54 → 4787.44] putting on Nexus devices
[4787.44 → 4788.40] which is kind of cool.
[4788.54 → 4789.26] I'm stoked to try it.
[4789.30 → 4790.16] I'm becoming more and more
[4790.16 → 4791.26] of a phone guy all the time.
[4791.34 → 4792.74] So, this is my first experience
[4792.74 → 4794.14] with vanilla Android.
[4794.66 → 4795.72] Pure Android experience.
[4796.92 → 4798.94] I'm going to be trying out
[4798.94 → 4800.38] Ubuntu phone at some point.
[4800.50 → 4801.18] I'm going to try out
[4801.18 → 4801.84] Cyanogen Mod
[4801.84 → 4802.46] as soon as I get
[4802.46 → 4803.56] my HTC One back.
[4804.36 → 4805.54] But I'm excited.
[4805.54 → 4807.16] I'm getting to the point
[4807.16 → 4808.22] where I can make observations
[4808.22 → 4808.86] about phones
[4808.86 → 4809.60] that aren't just stupid.
[4810.16 → 4810.84] Are you leaving?
[4811.26 → 4812.04] How are we getting
[4812.04 → 4812.66] all the gear there
[4812.66 → 4813.08] on Monday?
[4815.36 → 4816.52] Okay, we'll figure it out.
[4817.02 → 4818.14] We have a shoot on Monday.
[4819.56 → 4820.76] I don't.
[4820.86 → 4821.14] Aha!
[4821.84 → 4823.28] I will be benchmarking games.
[4823.44 → 4825.54] Our next topic is...
[4826.16 → 4829.54] AMD to bring...
[4829.54 → 4833.54] Wow.
[4833.54 → 4833.64] Wow.
[4835.54 → 4837.42] Just...
[4837.42 → 4838.70] So, this was posted
[4838.70 → 4839.24] on the forum
[4839.24 → 4840.26] by Top War Gamer
[4840.26 → 4841.90] and the original articles
[4841.90 → 4843.48] from Polygon.com.
[4843.58 → 4844.52] So, AMD to release
[4844.52 → 4845.78] Tress FX 2.0
[4845.78 → 4847.54] animates grass and fur.
[4848.66 → 4850.04] So, now we can have
[4850.04 → 4850.94] Lara Croft's hair
[4850.94 → 4852.48] and grass
[4852.48 → 4854.06] animated by Tress FX.
[4854.84 → 4855.28] Wow.
[4855.44 → 4856.60] You just made that joke.
[4857.18 → 4858.06] Well, I kind of had to.
[4858.10 → 4858.48] Wow.
[4858.48 → 4858.84] All right.
[4859.32 → 4860.16] So, Tress FX.
[4860.52 → 4861.40] Oh, God.
[4863.64 → 4864.86] I mean, there are good things
[4864.86 → 4865.22] about it.
[4865.28 → 4865.76] So, it's supported
[4865.76 → 4867.20] on both AMD and NVIDIA.
[4867.38 → 4868.06] So, that's a thing.
[4868.78 → 4869.96] It's phenomenally
[4869.96 → 4870.96] performance intensive.
[4871.50 → 4871.94] Oh, yeah.
[4872.10 → 4872.42] Huge.
[4872.42 → 4872.96] On low-end cars,
[4873.04 → 4873.78] what kind of performance
[4873.78 → 4874.52] deltas were you seeing?
[4874.52 → 4875.50] It almost halved it.
[4875.88 → 4876.10] Yeah.
[4876.20 → 4877.00] Like, whoa.
[4877.18 → 4877.72] Not quite,
[4877.80 → 4878.78] but like, close.
[4879.16 → 4879.74] On something like
[4879.74 → 4880.62] a 260X.
[4880.84 → 4882.72] On the R7 240 video,
[4882.80 → 4883.50] you'll notice that
[4883.50 → 4884.68] it's pretty high settings,
[4884.80 → 4885.84] but with Tress FX off.
[4885.92 → 4886.90] So, that's a real barrier.
[4887.44 → 4888.54] I mean, Mantle.me
[4888.54 → 4889.44] may alleviate
[4889.44 → 4890.54] these issues somewhat
[4890.54 → 4892.28] and improve the performance of it.
[4892.32 → 4892.56] It's like,
[4892.70 → 4893.42] I thanked everyone
[4893.42 → 4894.06] for being here
[4894.06 → 4895.18] and that we had 5,000 viewers
[4895.18 → 4895.74] and it went like
[4895.74 → 4896.10] all the way down
[4896.10 → 4896.76] to like 4,700
[4896.76 → 4897.46] for a bit there.
[4898.58 → 4899.12] It's like,
[4899.24 → 4899.70] yeah, well,
[4899.80 → 4899.98] you know,
[4900.02 → 4900.66] whatever, Linus.
[4901.36 → 4902.22] Screw you, man.
[4902.32 → 4902.82] Well, actually,
[4902.92 → 4903.40] I think it's just
[4903.40 → 4904.52] that the stream started late
[4904.52 → 4905.30] so people are...
[4905.30 → 4906.36] And we're currently at...
[4906.36 → 4906.54] Yeah.
[4906.98 → 4908.12] We're near 5,000.
[4908.38 → 4909.66] I'm using the XSplit number
[4909.66 → 4911.62] which isn't always up to date.
[4911.74 → 4912.52] Sometimes it's zero.
[4912.84 → 4912.96] I mean,
[4913.02 → 4913.70] the other problem
[4913.70 → 4914.10] that I have
[4914.10 → 4914.70] with Tress FX
[4914.70 → 4916.32] so besides the performance hit
[4916.32 → 4916.86] and maybe Mantle
[4916.86 → 4917.58] can alleviate this
[4917.58 → 4918.32] but it probably won't
[4918.32 → 4918.84] on NVIDIA
[4918.84 → 4919.68] because even though
[4919.68 → 4920.80] Tress FX works on NVIDIA
[4920.80 → 4921.28] blah, blah, blah
[4921.28 → 4921.88] they won't have Mantle
[4921.88 → 4922.80] unless they implement Mantle
[4922.80 → 4923.82] so it's all up in the air right now.
[4923.82 → 4923.98] Which they can.
[4924.66 → 4926.16] Is that the game list
[4926.16 → 4927.16] is a little bit
[4927.16 → 4928.30] ghost town.
[4928.56 → 4928.78] I mean,
[4928.86 → 4930.06] I criticize Phys.
[4930.12 → 4930.54] I do.
[4930.82 → 4932.16] I have criticized Phys
[4932.16 → 4933.10] many times in the past
[4933.10 → 4933.86] not because it isn't
[4933.86 → 4934.86] great technology.
[4935.02 → 4935.56] It is.
[4935.62 → 4936.26] It's cool.
[4936.60 → 4937.50] It could have ushered in
[4937.50 → 4938.96] a new era
[4938.96 → 4939.88] of gameplay
[4939.88 → 4941.12] if it hadn't been tied
[4941.12 → 4942.18] first to a proprietary
[4942.18 → 4943.62] PCI add-in card
[4943.62 → 4944.50] and then
[4944.50 → 4945.76] to one GPU maker.
[4945.98 → 4946.52] But I'm going to
[4946.52 → 4947.32] criticize Tress FX
[4947.32 → 4948.08] for the same thing
[4948.08 → 4948.56] right now.
[4948.90 → 4949.98] The game list
[4949.98 → 4951.24] is Tomb Raider.
[4952.62 → 4953.78] And Tomb Raider.
[4954.22 → 4954.54] Yeah.
[4954.76 → 4955.48] And I don't even mean
[4955.48 → 4956.04] Tomb Raider
[4956.04 → 4957.22] and the old Tomb Raider.
[4957.44 → 4959.20] I mean Tomb Raider 2013 edition
[4959.20 → 4960.60] and Tomb Raider 2013 edition.
[4960.72 → 4961.44] That's the problem.
[4961.44 → 4963.44] I will be so...
[4963.44 → 4966.68] I will pray to the gods of gaming
[4966.68 → 4969.04] if freaking Elder Scrolls 6
[4969.04 → 4970.86] comes with Tress FX 2.0
[4970.86 → 4973.44] because grass and fur...
[4974.44 → 4975.52] Random.
[4975.78 → 4976.90] In an Elder Scrolls game,
[4977.26 → 4978.78] Tress FX style would be amazing.
[4979.22 → 4980.98] Mods can already make it really cool
[4980.98 → 4982.26] but adding Tress FX to that
[4982.26 → 4983.44] and then allowing people to mod it...
[4984.20 → 4985.78] Like, holy crap.
[4986.12 → 4987.88] Imagine the grass mods
[4987.88 → 4988.76] that some people have been doing
[4988.76 → 4989.50] to Skyrim
[4989.50 → 4990.60] but with Tress FX.
[4991.14 → 4992.20] That would kill
[4992.20 → 4993.26] any system you have
[4993.26 → 4993.68] for one.
[4995.26 → 4996.20] But for two
[4996.20 → 4997.56] would look amazing.
[4997.78 → 4998.98] Melt all the GPUs.
[4999.02 → 5000.54] What's cool about Mantle 2 though
[5000.54 → 5001.58] is we could be looking
[5001.58 → 5002.88] at a completely different way
[5002.88 → 5003.34] of interacting
[5003.34 → 5004.68] with multi-GPU systems.
[5005.04 → 5005.84] So you could kind of go,
[5005.94 → 5006.46] yeah, no,
[5006.58 → 5007.90] this is my Tress FX card
[5007.90 → 5009.26] and this is my this
[5009.26 → 5010.04] and this is my that
[5010.04 → 5010.64] and you throw like
[5010.64 → 5011.66] three different GPUs
[5011.66 → 5012.14] in your system
[5012.14 → 5012.66] and I mean,
[5012.74 → 5013.66] we're talking later on
[5013.66 → 5014.16] down the future
[5014.16 → 5015.44] but we're just talking about
[5015.44 → 5016.24] the way that AMD
[5016.24 → 5016.94] is approaching
[5016.94 → 5018.32] allowing game developers
[5018.32 → 5020.36] to spread out resources
[5020.36 → 5021.12] and leverage them
[5021.12 → 5022.28] the way that they want to.
[5022.42 → 5023.46] Oh, it's an exciting world.
[5023.52 → 5024.60] We haven't even talked enough
[5024.60 → 5025.40] about Kaveri.
[5025.78 → 5026.18] We're going to have to
[5026.18 → 5027.08] talk about it next week.
[5027.18 → 5027.36] I mean,
[5027.44 → 5028.84] heterogeneous system architecture
[5028.84 → 5029.36] is going to be
[5029.36 → 5030.22] such a big deal
[5030.22 → 5031.48] allowing the CPU
[5031.48 → 5032.00] and the GPU
[5032.00 → 5033.52] to access the memory resources
[5033.52 → 5034.00] they need
[5034.00 → 5034.76] and share them.
[5035.18 → 5036.30] One thing that I'm super,
[5036.42 → 5037.08] sorry to cut you off
[5037.08 → 5037.46] a little bit,
[5037.56 → 5038.66] one thing I'm super stoked
[5038.66 → 5039.76] with AMD about lately
[5039.76 → 5040.86] is how they develop
[5040.86 → 5041.92] this awesome thing.
[5042.02 → 5042.68] Yeah, like Tress FX.
[5042.68 → 5042.88] Tress FX.
[5043.16 → 5044.52] And like HSA
[5044.52 → 5045.90] and just go like,
[5045.98 → 5046.58] yeah, sure.
[5047.36 → 5047.76] Open.
[5048.18 → 5048.78] Or they just say,
[5048.94 → 5049.82] someone else deal with it.
[5049.88 → 5050.54] We'll just develop it.
[5050.54 → 5051.30] And it's just like,
[5051.44 → 5051.76] I mean,
[5051.82 → 5052.74] is this a return
[5052.74 → 5054.28] to the Athlon 64 days
[5054.28 → 5054.88] where they said,
[5054.94 → 5055.10] look,
[5055.34 → 5057.62] here's our 64-bit extension
[5057.62 → 5058.72] and Intel,
[5058.84 → 5059.08] go ahead.
[5060.18 → 5060.42] Well,
[5060.46 → 5061.24] we'll license it to you,
[5061.32 → 5061.52] obviously.
[5061.56 → 5061.78] Yeah.
[5061.94 → 5062.26] Intel,
[5062.42 → 5063.16] but basically,
[5063.16 → 5064.50] we want this to be
[5064.50 → 5065.08] a standard.
[5065.18 → 5066.30] We worked really hard on this.
[5066.56 → 5067.46] We'd like for people
[5067.46 → 5068.06] to use it.
[5068.06 → 5071.34] I hope they do
[5071.34 → 5072.10] because it could be awesome.
[5072.18 → 5073.10] Someone just said in the chat,
[5073.38 → 5073.76] there's already
[5073.76 → 5075.26] Tress FX style mods
[5075.26 → 5075.84] for Skyrim,
[5075.96 → 5076.96] but one thing that he also
[5076.96 → 5077.36] brought up,
[5077.44 → 5078.26] which is very important,
[5078.38 → 5079.22] is it doesn't support
[5079.22 → 5080.26] like collision detection
[5080.26 → 5080.64] and stuff.
[5080.72 → 5080.96] Right.
[5081.12 → 5082.52] Which is like a huge deal.
[5082.70 → 5082.90] Yeah.
[5083.14 → 5083.38] So,
[5083.38 → 5084.50] you know what?
[5084.60 → 5085.46] I think we have to
[5085.46 → 5086.50] cut off the show now,
[5086.56 → 5087.46] even though we honestly
[5087.46 → 5088.80] had probably a dozen more
[5088.80 → 5089.58] topics that we would have
[5089.58 → 5090.66] loved to talk to you guys about.
[5090.80 → 5091.34] As always,
[5091.72 → 5092.68] you can check out
[5092.68 → 5094.00] the document
[5094.00 → 5095.80] in the description
[5095.80 → 5097.12] of the YouTube archive.
[5097.12 → 5097.60] So,
[5097.68 → 5098.64] if you just wanted to see
[5098.64 → 5099.18] what we thought
[5099.18 → 5100.16] was interesting this week,
[5100.18 → 5101.22] even if we didn't get a chance
[5101.22 → 5101.94] to talk about it,
[5101.98 → 5102.66] please go ahead
[5102.66 → 5103.28] and do that.
[5104.10 → 5105.28] Thank you so much
[5105.28 → 5106.02] for watching, guys.
[5106.12 → 5107.32] Huge thanks again
[5107.32 → 5108.52] to Hotspot Shield
[5108.52 → 5109.80] for sponsoring the show today.
[5110.12 → 5111.30] It's so hard for us
[5111.30 → 5112.08] to bring a show
[5112.08 → 5113.00] like this to you guys
[5113.00 → 5113.88] with all the work
[5113.88 → 5114.78] that goes into it
[5114.78 → 5115.74] without sponsors
[5115.74 → 5116.60] to make it possible.
[5116.76 → 5117.18] So, guys,
[5117.30 → 5118.56] if you haven't checked out
[5118.56 → 5119.78] Hotspot Shield before,
[5120.16 → 5120.68] check it out.
[5120.74 → 5121.24] bit.ly
[5121.24 → 5122.38] slash share
[5122.38 → 5123.02] and if you wanted
[5123.02 → 5124.08] to use a VPN solution
[5124.08 → 5125.38] that's particularly applicable
[5125.38 → 5126.86] to our outside the U.S.
[5126.86 → 5128.32] viewers.
[5129.08 → 5129.18] Guys,
[5129.18 → 5129.90] for whatever reason.
[5130.00 → 5130.66] Try it out.
[5130.78 → 5131.94] Give Hotspot Shield a chance.
[5132.06 → 5132.96] The trial is free
[5132.96 → 5134.32] and if you have any problems
[5134.32 → 5134.94] and you post them
[5134.94 → 5135.40] on the forum,
[5135.50 → 5136.02] Hotspot Shield
[5136.02 → 5136.98] has been pretty proactive
[5136.98 → 5137.56] about helping
[5137.56 → 5138.56] linustechtips.com
[5138.56 → 5139.20] forum members.
[5139.36 → 5139.72] It's really cool.
[5139.74 → 5140.28] Which, again,
[5140.58 → 5141.62] we appreciate the support,
[5141.70 → 5142.08] you guys.
[5142.20 → 5143.54] That sets you apart
[5143.54 → 5145.06] from...
[5145.06 → 5145.46] Again,
[5145.60 → 5146.52] we need to make them
[5146.52 → 5147.22] an industry affiliate.
[5147.34 → 5147.46] Yeah,
[5147.50 → 5148.22] we should probably do that.
[5148.82 → 5149.06] Alright,
[5149.44 → 5150.12] peace out, guys.
[5150.22 → 5150.82] Thanks for watching.
[5150.88 → 5151.70] Are you doing an after-party?
[5151.70 → 5152.66] I am doing an after-party.
[5152.78 → 5154.32] I'll cover Bill Logs of the Week there.
[5154.60 → 5154.86] Sorry,
[5155.02 → 5155.78] we didn't have time.
[5155.78 → 5156.62] Um,
[5156.66 → 5158.12] and I will try and cover
[5158.12 → 5159.00] some of the other
[5159.00 → 5159.64] random topics
[5159.64 → 5160.22] that we didn't cover.
[5160.24 → 5160.34] So,
[5160.44 → 5161.44] unofficial after-party
[5161.44 → 5162.04] on the
[5162.04 → 5163.06] twitch.tv
[5163.06 → 5163.58] slash
[5163.58 → 5164.54] Luke underscore
[5164.54 → 5165.44] LAIR
[5165.44 → 5166.70] channel.
[5167.08 → 5167.52] So,
[5167.68 → 5168.02] um,
[5168.08 → 5168.36] guys,
[5168.58 → 5169.54] we've noticed
[5169.54 → 5170.50] quite a few people
[5170.50 → 5171.48] are subscribing
[5171.48 → 5172.40] to that channel.
[5172.76 → 5173.88] It should be noted
[5173.88 → 5174.48] that,
[5174.58 → 5175.02] um,
[5175.08 → 5176.36] we're going to have some...
[5176.36 → 5177.34] If you wanna support
[5177.34 → 5179.10] us and what we do here,
[5179.24 → 5180.04] there will be some
[5180.04 → 5180.94] better options
[5180.94 → 5182.18] where more of the revenue
[5182.18 → 5182.72] actually
[5182.72 → 5184.60] goes to us.
[5184.76 → 5185.62] It's public dollars.
[5185.70 → 5186.66] Twitch takes 50%.
[5186.66 → 5186.96] Yeah,
[5187.16 → 5187.58] soon.
[5187.92 → 5188.16] So,
[5188.28 → 5188.82] if you kind of
[5188.82 → 5189.84] stay tuned for that,
[5190.18 → 5190.72] there's going to be,
[5190.80 → 5190.92] like,
[5190.96 → 5191.86] some perfect stuff.
[5192.22 → 5192.64] Everyone says,
[5192.72 → 5192.86] alright,
[5192.98 → 5193.58] screw Linus.
[5193.62 → 5194.26] Everyone over to
[5194.26 → 5194.94] Pistol's channel.
[5196.38 → 5196.82] Alright,
[5196.98 → 5197.22] guys,
[5197.34 → 5198.18] why don't we do
[5198.18 → 5198.88] that whole thing
[5198.88 → 5199.72] where we stop streaming
[5199.72 → 5200.36] and then we dump
[5200.36 → 5200.60] everyone?
[5200.72 → 5200.82] Okay,
[5200.86 → 5201.54] everyone go over
[5201.54 → 5202.42] to Pistol's channel.
[5202.60 → 5202.78] So,

[5204.12 → 5204.38] uh,
[5204.42 → 5205.26] is also a member
[5205.26 → 5206.30] of the Tech Syndicate team.
[5206.38 → 5206.44] So,
[5206.50 → 5207.30] that's Logan and Wendell,
[5207.34 → 5207.96] our guest today.
[5207.96 → 5209.24] everyone go over there

[5212.08 → 5212.30] Yeah,
[5212.42 → 5212.96] YOLO.
[5213.72 → 5213.90] Well,
[5213.94 → 5214.66] you do only live once.
[5214.68 → 5215.80] Are you becoming Easel now?
[5216.50 → 5216.86] Well,
[5217.32 → 5217.86] I don't know.
[5217.98 → 5218.22] I've been,
[5218.22 → 5219.64] I've been working with you guys
[5219.64 → 5220.58] for a long time.
[5220.70 → 5221.34] I know.
[5221.54 → 5221.76] Like,
[5221.82 → 5222.84] I've been working with him
[5222.84 → 5223.76] over a year now.
[5223.88 → 5224.56] Isn't that crazy?
[5224.80 → 5225.36] Over two years.
[5225.36 → 5225.74] I've been working with you
[5225.74 → 5226.68] over two years.
[5227.36 → 5227.74] Like,
[5228.04 → 5230.30] are we friends?
[5230.88 → 5231.42] Ha ha ha!
[5231.88 → 5233.30] Is the name of our company
[5233.30 → 5233.76] bad?
[5234.54 → 5234.78] Yeah,
[5234.78 → 5235.50] Linus Media Group's
[5235.50 → 5236.12] a stupid name
[5236.12 → 5236.50] for our company.
[5236.78 → 5237.94] Ha ha ha ha ha!
[5238.62 → 5239.10] And they take us
[5239.10 → 5239.30] over two years.
[5240.48 → 5242.60] That was a great day.
[5243.60 → 5244.20] They're on top of these.
[5244.40 → 5244.86] Okay,
[5244.96 → 5245.60] and I will be one of the curation
[5245.60 → 5245.78] of our company.
[5245.80 → 5246.74] I sing.
[5247.26 → 5248.10] If you've been doing live once,
[5248.10 → 5249.58] I don't know how many Sind
[5249.58 → 5250.70] watching,
[5250.70 → 5250.94] because you're going to see
[5250.94 → 5252.00] whether now they're going to
[5252.00 → 5252.38] they have a Sara.
[5252.38 → 5253.42] Even if not,
[5253.52 → 5254.82] you probably don't know how many
[5254.82 → 5254.90] do you want to do.
[5254.98 → 5256.16] Unless they look at where
[5256.16 → 5256.98] you're going to see
[5256.98 → 5258.64] that there's going to be
[5258.64 → 5259.46] to play.
[5260.50 → 5260.58] or will have an issue
[5260.90 → 5261.66] be a douche
[5261.98 → 5263.10] DAR
[5263.46 → 5264.74] in the house.
[5264.74 → 5267.18] And the
