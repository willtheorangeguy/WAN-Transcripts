# WAN Transcripts — Documentation

This archive holds machine-generated transcripts and summaries for LTT Live Show and WAN Show episodes, together with the pipeline that produces them. The pipeline runs as 7 numbered stages; `main.py` executes them in order.

- [Architecture](./architecture.md) — data flow, on-disk layout, how resumability works
- [External services](./api.md) — what this depends on that it does not control
- [Usage](./usage.md) — running the pipeline and the helper scripts
- [Pipeline](./pipeline.md) — what each stage does and what it writes
- [FAQ](./faq.md) — licensing, accuracy, speed, regenerating output
