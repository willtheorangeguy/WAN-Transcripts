# WAN Transcripts — Pipeline

The archive is built by 7 scripts run in numeric order. `main.py` is a thin runner that calls each one in turn with the arguments you gave it, so running a stage by hand and letting `main.py` do it are equivalent.

| Stage | Script | What it does | Resume log |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `1_download.py` | This script uses yt-dlp to download videos, by year, from the LTT Archive YouTube Channel playlists of WAN Show episodes. | — |
| 2 | `2_converter.py` | This script converts all video files in a specified folder to audio files using ffmpeg. | `converted.log` |
| 3 | `3_tagger.py` | Writes ID3 tags (title, date, track number) onto the downloaded audio using metadata pulled from the show's RSS feed. | `tagged.log` |
| 4 | `4_transcriber.py` | This script transcribes audio files from WAN Show episodes using OpenAI's Whisper model. | `transcribed.log` |
| 5 | `5_summarizer.py` | This script summarizes a transcript file by splitting it into manageable chunks, summarizing each chunk using the Ollama API, and then combining the summaries into a final summary. | `summarized.log` |
| 6 | `6_comments.py` | This script fetches all comments made by a specific user on all videos in a given YouTube playlist. It uses the YouTube Data API v3 to retrieve video IDs from the playlist and then fetch the related comments. | `comments.log` |
| 7 | `7_cleanup.py` | This script processes all .txt and .md files in the current directory, correcting their grammar and spelling using LanguageTool. | `cleaned.log` |

## Running a single stage

Every stage takes the same arguments as `main.py`, so any one of them can be re-run on its own without repeating the stages before it:

```bash
python 1_download.py <year>
```

## Re-running and resume logs

The expensive stages append to a log file as they finish each item, and skip anything already listed there on a later run. That is what makes the pipeline resumable after an interruption.

| Log | Written by |
|---|---|
| `converted.log` | `2_converter.py` |
| `tagged.log` | `3_tagger.py` |
| `transcribed.log` | `4_transcriber.py` |
| `summarized.log` | `5_summarizer.py` |
| `comments.log` | `6_comments.py` |
| `cleaned.log` | `7_cleanup.py` |

Delete a log to force its stage to redo everything.

## A note on accuracy

Transcription and summarisation are both lossy. Neither the transcripts nor the summaries in this repository are an authoritative record — check the original recording where it matters. See [`CONTENT_LICENSE.md`](../CONTENT_LICENSE.md).
