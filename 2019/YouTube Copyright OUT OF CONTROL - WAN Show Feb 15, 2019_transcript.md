[0.00 --> 2.00]  Oh
[5.32 --> 9.52]  Ladies and gentlemen boys and girls welcome back to the WAN show it's been another week
[9.52 --> 14.90]  Which means you have to sit through another WAN show that is to say you want to sit through another WAN show because no one is actually
[14.90 --> 21.24]  Forced to sit through the WAN show except Luke yeah, and you and me yeah, yeah, have you heard the song?
[21.76 --> 27.86]  There's a song didn't think about it until you just did that intro there's a someone made an electronic song recently
[27.86 --> 35.70]  Using like our voices as some of the lines in the song and he intros the song with you introing the WAN show
[36.54 --> 41.90]  No, I have not heard the song he tweeted at your personal account. You should oh, okay?
[41.90 --> 46.86]  I haven't actually looked at my personal Twitter and like I I suspected kind of as much
[47.58 --> 51.96]  Probably a couple of weeks. Oh, so we're just linked it in chat apparently people nice
[52.20 --> 57.54]  Okay, give me just just a minute here. I gotta get logged into a float plane
[57.54 --> 63.48]  So I can see our float plane peeps one of the things one of the things we're gonna talk about this week is YouTube copyright being
[63.52 --> 68.92]  Kind of kind of craziness. Yeah, but actually a fairly positive story from it
[69.70 --> 75.26]  Turn around so there's a there's a couple of actual so so I was really what I was wanted to do
[75.48 --> 82.10]  Was explain the difference between a content ID match and a copyright strike?
[82.10 --> 88.40]  Okay, because there seems to be a lot of confusion and there was that a content ID match there was a significant
[88.40 --> 94.86]  Well, it depends which controversy you're talking about because there was a controversy we were wrapped up in oh
[95.38 --> 99.60]  Yeah, I didn't know this. Yeah, so we'll we'll get into that a little bit later. Exciting!
[99.60 --> 101.54]  And then in terms of other topics
[101.54 --> 104.58]  I see. James has been busy shooting the mono price
[104.58 --> 113.76]  Gaming battle station video with me for the last couple of hours. So he's done very little actual preparation of the WAN show document today
[113.76 --> 116.74]  There's some stuff. But there is some stuff. Activision Blizzard laid off
[117.98 --> 119.98]  800 people
[119.98 --> 123.88]  Just like what 10% of their staff 8% excuse me pardon me. So we'll talk about that.
[123.88 --> 128.06]  Despite making as far as I know very good profits. Yep, so we'll talk talk more about that later
[128.06 --> 136.36]  And what else we got a European link tax language has been finalized link taxes so YouTube's copyright
[137.44 --> 144.40]  Enforcement is probably gonna get more complicated as opposed to less complicated if all of that stuff goes through
[144.40 --> 149.44]  So this is closely related to the article 13 controversy that was going on a couple of months back
[150.02 --> 155.30]  Article 13 stuff is still going on. Oh, yeah. Yeah, very much very much still a thing. This is just sorry
[155.30 --> 161.62]  I mean it was it kind of reached a fever pitch those couple of my article 13 pitchforks are pretty important for me
[161.62 --> 167.12]  So keep keep them up if you wouldn't mind. Yeah, if you want to make Luke's job not like
[168.62 --> 169.62]  phenomenally
[169.62 --> 171.62]  way more difficult
[171.92 --> 176.98]  It's gonna the the biggest problem in my opinion even though I'm trying to become a platform
[176.98 --> 180.36]  I still think the biggest problem in my opinion is for creators
[180.92 --> 182.92]  because it's going to
[182.92 --> 186.08]  Increase the wall for creators coming into the market
[186.08 --> 190.24]  It's going to make creators lose their jobs because it's going to be harder for the platform
[190.24 --> 194.84]  It's gonna cost more for the platforms to support themselves. I think it's gonna be harder for the creators
[194.84 --> 198.48]  So we'll talk about it in more detail later first the intro I
[200.68 --> 205.28]  Saw this coming and I don't know why the way you said the intro is like he's not gonna click it right away
[207.84 --> 210.74]  Don't know why I have no idea
[212.92 --> 214.92]  I
[214.92 --> 216.92]  I
[216.92 --> 218.92]  I
[218.92 --> 220.92]  I
[220.92 --> 222.92]  I
[222.92 --> 224.92]  I
[224.92 --> 226.92]  I
[226.92 --> 228.92]  I
[228.92 --> 230.92]  I
[230.92 --> 232.92]  I
[232.92 --> 234.92]  I
[234.92 --> 236.92]  I
[236.92 --> 238.92]  I
[238.92 --> 240.92]  I
[240.92 --> 242.92]  I
[242.92 --> 244.92]  I
[244.92 --> 246.92]  I
[246.92 --> 248.92]  I
[248.92 --> 250.92]  I
[250.92 --> 252.92]  I
[252.92 --> 254.92]  I
[254.92 --> 256.92]  I
[256.92 --> 258.92]  I
[258.92 --> 260.92]  I
[260.92 --> 262.92]  I
[262.92 --> 264.92]  I
[264.92 --> 266.92]  I
[266.92 --> 268.92]  I
[268.92 --> 270.92]  I
[270.92 --> 272.92]  I
[272.92 --> 274.92]  I
[274.92 --> 276.92]  I
[276.92 --> 278.92]  I
[278.92 --> 280.92]  I
[280.92 --> 282.92]  I
[282.92 --> 284.92]  I
[284.92 --> 298.92]  I
[298.92 --> 300.92]  I
[300.92 --> 302.92]  I
[302.92 --> 304.92]  I
[304.92 --> 306.92]  I
[306.92 --> 308.92]  I
[308.92 --> 310.92]  I
[310.92 --> 312.92]  I
[312.92 --> 314.92]  I
[314.92 --> 316.92]  I
[316.92 --> 318.92]  I
[318.92 --> 320.92]  I
[320.92 --> 322.92]  I
[322.92 --> 324.92]  I
[324.92 --> 326.92]  I
[326.92 --> 328.92]  I
[328.92 --> 330.92]  I
[330.92 --> 332.92]  I
[332.92 --> 334.92]  I
[334.92 --> 336.92]  I
[336.92 --> 338.92]  I
[338.92 --> 340.92]  I
[340.92 --> 342.92]  I
[342.92 --> 344.92]  I
[344.92 --> 346.92]  I
[346.92 --> 348.92]  I
[348.92 --> 350.92]  I
[350.92 --> 352.92]  I
[352.92 --> 354.92]  I
[354.92 --> 356.92]  I
[356.92 --> 358.92]  I
[358.92 --> 360.92]  I
[360.92 --> 362.92]  I
[362.92 --> 364.92]  I
[364.92 --> 366.92]  I
[366.92 --> 368.92]  I
[368.92 --> 370.92]  I
[370.92 --> 372.92]  I
[372.92 --> 374.92]  I
[374.92 --> 376.92]  I
[376.92 --> 378.92]  I
[378.92 --> 380.92]  I
[380.92 --> 382.92]  I
[382.92 --> 384.92]  I
[384.92 --> 386.92]  I
[386.92 --> 388.92]  I
[388.92 --> 390.92]  I
[390.92 --> 392.92]  I
[392.92 --> 394.92]  I
[394.92 --> 396.92]  I
[396.92 --> 398.92]  I
[398.92 --> 400.92]  I
[400.92 --> 402.92]  I
[402.92 --> 404.92]  I
[404.92 --> 406.92]  I
[406.92 --> 408.86]  Well, at one point, I'm super tactful.
[408.92 --> 409.60]  We're like at dinner.
[409.68 --> 412.30]  I'm like, so what ethnicity are you?
[412.74 --> 414.40]  Because I just couldn't tell.
[415.36 --> 417.10]  In fairness to me, he's mixed.
[417.38 --> 421.76]  So it's not like I was, you know, if I was going to guess, you know, pure blood anything,
[422.08 --> 424.44]  then I was going to be wrong regardless.
[424.98 --> 425.12]  Okay.
[425.56 --> 425.78]  Yeah.
[426.18 --> 430.46]  Anyway, he's like, yo, I'm half Asian.
[430.58 --> 431.78]  I'm like, oh, okay, cool.
[431.78 --> 435.00]  Anyway, so that's why he's allowed to do this character,
[435.00 --> 437.70]  which for anyone else to do would be incredibly racist.
[437.96 --> 444.68]  So he's this sort of, he has this kind of heavily Chinese-accented Lyle character
[444.68 --> 451.82]  that he uses to kind of provide broken English feedback on various things.
[451.90 --> 455.86]  In this case, he did a reaction to The Verge's PC building guide.
[455.92 --> 457.20]  It's actually very funny.
[457.66 --> 459.60]  No offense to anything else Kyle's ever done,
[459.60 --> 462.96]  but it was by far the best video he's ever created, bar none.
[462.96 --> 467.02]  I mean, it helps that the source material that he was working with was comedy gold.
[467.34 --> 468.00]  Absolute gold.
[468.08 --> 473.62]  And all he had to do was platinum plate it, and it was just like, wow, this is quality right now.
[475.22 --> 478.16]  And if you're interested, it is back up on his YouTube channel,
[478.28 --> 480.36]  or it never went off of his flow plane channel.
[480.36 --> 483.60]  Yes, thank you for bringing that up for the second time, whatever your name is.
[483.66 --> 483.84]  Luke.
[483.90 --> 484.40]  I got you.
[484.96 --> 487.18]  Yeah, that should be your alternate character, kook.
[488.96 --> 490.60]  I don't know what accent you can do, though.
[491.32 --> 492.14]  I had no kook.
[492.14 --> 493.82]  Nothing politically correct, that's for sure.
[493.96 --> 494.16]  No, yeah.
[494.82 --> 499.00]  Okay, so in the days, so let's go back in time again.
[499.00 --> 501.52]  In the days following The Verge's original upload,
[501.64 --> 505.46]  there was just massive backlash throughout the PC building community.
[505.96 --> 508.04]  We mostly, I think, stayed out of it.
[508.04 --> 510.62]  I think we posted a couple tweets, just kind of tongue-in-cheek.
[511.30 --> 517.00]  But lots of people, not just Kyle, quite a few people posted video responses.
[517.78 --> 521.04]  There was some pretty in-depth discussion on our forum about it,
[521.08 --> 523.62]  just because it was so bad.
[524.90 --> 528.30]  Anyway, The Verge stood by it for a while.
[528.38 --> 529.00]  That was weird.
[529.24 --> 531.26]  Which was what made it far worse.
[531.50 --> 534.14]  If they had just said, hey, we were wrong.
[534.14 --> 538.22]  Because honestly, rather than make fun of them, my first outreach to them was,
[538.62 --> 542.86]  Hey, do you guys want to collaborate to take another shot at this?
[543.40 --> 546.02]  And they just never replied.
[546.34 --> 551.04]  So they never replied to just an earnest offer of help.
[551.28 --> 553.64]  And then they doubled down.
[554.88 --> 560.62]  And the creator of the video in particular said some pretty stupid stuff on Twitter.
[560.92 --> 563.80]  I don't remember any of the particulars because it was a while ago.
[563.80 --> 566.52]  But just basically defending it.
[566.66 --> 569.56]  Like, oh, yeah, well, well, well, you know, we fixed those things after the video.
[570.14 --> 572.00]  Then, like, don't call it a guide, then.
[572.12 --> 572.38]  Guide, yeah.
[573.00 --> 575.54]  It's not a guide if it's broken at the end.
[575.56 --> 577.06]  It was, like, actually problematic.
[577.66 --> 578.02]  Yes.
[578.14 --> 579.12]  Because it was a guide.
[579.54 --> 579.90]  Yeah.
[580.26 --> 581.76]  Which added a lot of problems.
[581.82 --> 583.58]  It wasn't like, hey, I'm building a computer.
[583.68 --> 584.30]  You want to watch?
[584.72 --> 585.88]  It was, this is how.
[585.98 --> 590.88]  If they had made mistakes in the context of doing, like, an IRL Twitch stream.
[590.88 --> 591.36]  Yeah.
[592.14 --> 593.96]  Which we saw very recently.
[594.50 --> 599.76]  Everybody has, everybody does something for the first time and doesn't do it perfectly at some point.
[600.00 --> 600.78]  Believe it or not.
[600.86 --> 603.72]  Like, if you've ever watched me do anything related to my car, you'll know.
[604.02 --> 604.94]  You'll know what's up.
[605.04 --> 605.78]  I don't think you have.
[605.88 --> 606.38]  But it's bad.
[606.44 --> 607.06]  It's a bad scene.
[607.22 --> 608.30]  I'm bad with that kind of stuff, too.
[608.30 --> 610.44]  Or, like, watching me use tools.
[611.34 --> 612.10]  I mean, you wouldn't know.
[612.18 --> 613.08]  You're just as bad as me.
[613.34 --> 615.00]  But, you know, our audience.
[615.00 --> 616.36]  Our audience knows what's up.
[616.40 --> 618.26]  I use a lot of them for the first time with you.
[618.38 --> 618.52]  Yeah.
[618.90 --> 619.60]  Do you remember this?
[619.72 --> 620.70]  Do you remember the tape?
[622.30 --> 623.40]  The tape protection?
[623.74 --> 624.28]  Oh, Lord.
[627.24 --> 629.82]  It's a good thing we both still have both of our eyes.
[629.84 --> 630.16]  Yeah.
[630.16 --> 636.24]  So what made it worse was just not acknowledging the problems and doubling down.
[636.58 --> 640.34]  And then making it even worse than that.
[640.76 --> 642.42]  Here we are these months later.
[642.60 --> 643.80]  Everyone has kind of forgotten about it.
[643.80 --> 643.92]  Yeah.
[643.98 --> 645.80]  The Verge did eventually pull their video.
[645.96 --> 646.16]  Yeah.
[646.78 --> 651.82]  Not before they, like, hid the like-dislike bar, hid comments.
[651.96 --> 653.74]  Like, they tried everything to keep it up.
[653.98 --> 658.48]  But eventually they were just like, yeah, this is probably a problem.
[658.60 --> 659.20]  And pulled it down.
[660.16 --> 664.36]  Then what happened is earlier, was it earlier this week?
[664.42 --> 665.46]  What's the actual date on this?
[666.82 --> 668.16]  February 12th.
[669.18 --> 673.30]  February 12th, they issued a copyright strike.
[673.30 --> 677.78]  So they issued a DMCA takedown request for Kyle's video.
[677.96 --> 685.84]  So not only did Vox Media, the owner of The Verge, go and have the video removed from their own channel,
[685.92 --> 689.28]  which is well within their right to do and probably for the best.
[689.28 --> 695.38]  They went out and they submitted a takedown request for Kyle's video.
[695.62 --> 697.28]  Now, here's the problem with that.
[697.72 --> 705.30]  Were you keeping track of what was going on with Ethan Klein and that reaction video that he posted that he ended up taking all the way to court?
[705.38 --> 706.10]  It's been a bit.
[706.10 --> 709.88]  But I watched all of the lawyers' videos on it.
[709.88 --> 710.92]  And I watched their videos on it.
[710.92 --> 711.10]  Sorry.
[711.70 --> 714.28]  For those who, I don't know, some people just go by H3.
[714.28 --> 714.30]  H3.
[714.30 --> 714.52]  Yeah.
[714.74 --> 715.22]  Oh.
[715.46 --> 716.18]  Oh, yeah.
[716.30 --> 716.60]  Yeah, yeah.
[716.70 --> 717.44]  There's a podcast and stuff.
[717.54 --> 717.68]  Yeah.
[717.90 --> 718.04]  Yeah.
[718.04 --> 718.24]  Okay.
[718.24 --> 720.30]  So anyway, Ethan Klein, H3H3.
[721.04 --> 721.22]  Yeah.
[722.00 --> 722.28]  Anyway.
[722.50 --> 722.66]  Yeah.
[722.66 --> 736.32]  So what happened there, and I'm a little rusty on the details, but basically what happened was H3H3 used to upload a lot more just kind of, what do I call them?
[736.48 --> 739.58]  They'd like watch a video and like cringe at it, basically.
[739.58 --> 746.82]  Yeah, reaction, like, takedowns, like, just like, where they just kind of crap on the original video creator.
[747.36 --> 757.42]  And so what happened in that case, and I forget what the name of the person who issued the takedown was, and it doesn't matter because screw that guy.
[757.56 --> 758.74]  We're not going to talk about that guy.
[758.76 --> 759.10]  Good call.
[759.28 --> 763.94]  But he got upset because Ethan was mean to him.
[764.32 --> 766.72]  And in his defense, Ethan was pretty mean.
[767.38 --> 767.58]  Yeah.
[767.58 --> 768.92]  And it was kind of unnecessary.
[768.92 --> 770.42]  This one back then used to be pretty brutal.
[770.62 --> 770.82]  Yeah.
[771.02 --> 772.72]  Like, just kind of unnecessary.
[773.36 --> 775.96]  But I guess it gets views, so cool.
[776.28 --> 776.40]  Yeah.
[777.26 --> 778.60]  Anyway, he got mad.
[778.84 --> 780.10]  And he was like, well, hold on a second.
[780.66 --> 785.18]  Ethan's video contains a ton of my copyrighted material.
[785.56 --> 790.34]  I should be able to DMCA takedown that because it's got my content in it.
[790.66 --> 794.30]  The issue is that there's a little thing called fair use.
[794.30 --> 802.24]  So Ethan's defense was, well, look, this is fair use because I am critiquing it.
[802.84 --> 803.66]  I am.
[804.30 --> 805.10]  So there's four.
[805.18 --> 807.38]  There's basically four fair use factors.
[807.38 --> 816.44]  So you can use someone else's copyrighted material as long as you can defend your sort of fair use use of it.
[816.50 --> 823.96]  Now, the problem is that fair use is a really gray and nebulous part of copyright law.
[823.96 --> 832.80]  It's not as simple as, like, if you meet criterias X, Y, Z, and omega, you qualify as fair use.
[832.88 --> 833.84]  And there are some guidelines.
[834.16 --> 837.60]  So you'll notice, for example, I forget what the actual number of seconds is,
[837.82 --> 845.98]  but news shows will often limit the amount of source material that they use to, like, 10 seconds or something along those lines.
[845.98 --> 848.44]  But that's not the law.
[848.80 --> 853.72]  Because, like, consider if you just posted, like, a half-hour video that someone else made,
[853.98 --> 856.38]  and every 45 seconds you went, good.
[857.52 --> 858.80]  That's not really transformative.
[859.14 --> 861.32]  That's not really, like, it's not really a review.
[861.72 --> 863.20]  So, like, where is the hard line?
[863.26 --> 864.40]  It's a very hard line to actually post.
[864.40 --> 864.52]  Yeah.
[864.90 --> 866.94]  So there's a number of things.
[867.30 --> 873.00]  There's the amount and the substantiality of the content that has been reused.
[873.00 --> 876.58]  So that's why news programs will take, like, 10 seconds.
[876.80 --> 879.04]  Because then it's not the whole thing.
[879.12 --> 879.84]  It's pretty easy to argue.
[880.06 --> 882.60]  There's the purpose and character of the use.
[883.04 --> 886.28]  Does it have its own purpose for existing?
[886.66 --> 889.06]  There's the nature of the copyrighted work.
[889.16 --> 895.02]  So if it was something along the lines of a, let's say, an instructional video,
[895.26 --> 898.76]  and you were to go ahead and take each step of the instructions,
[899.60 --> 901.64]  have it be up on screen, running in its entirety,
[901.64 --> 904.12]  and go, that seems like a good idea.
[904.30 --> 905.56]  Like, kind of like what Luke was saying.
[906.02 --> 911.84]  Then that would sort of affect whether or not that would be considered fair use.
[912.00 --> 915.24]  And then finally, there's the effect upon the works value,
[915.36 --> 920.14]  which is closely related, where if I were to create this, my video,
[920.84 --> 923.94]  commenting, good job, original video creator,
[924.10 --> 925.76]  every once in a while while it plays,
[925.76 --> 929.22]  would that affect their ability to monetize that content?
[929.42 --> 929.88]  Probably.
[930.60 --> 936.02]  So you can end up with a really solid fair use argument
[936.02 --> 939.54]  for utilizing all kinds of content.
[940.02 --> 943.10]  Like, movie review channels rely heavily on fair use.
[943.14 --> 947.60]  Because in a lot of cases, they'll have 5, 10, 15 minutes
[947.60 --> 952.48]  of unedited, like, Hollywood movies playing on the channel.
[952.96 --> 955.20]  But the reason they can get away with that
[955.20 --> 959.08]  is that they are reusing it for the purpose of critique.
[959.22 --> 960.36]  They are commenting on it.
[960.60 --> 964.70]  And it doesn't affect the ability of that Hollywood studio
[964.70 --> 966.26]  to monetize that content.
[966.26 --> 968.60]  Because no one is watching that review and going,
[968.94 --> 972.28]  oh, I have fully enjoyed all the nuances
[972.28 --> 976.78]  of the editing, cinematography, soundtrack, acting, and story.
[977.68 --> 978.52]  It's not like that.
[979.12 --> 980.56]  So it's highly transformative.
[980.92 --> 982.96]  It's for critique or review,
[983.16 --> 986.38]  which is generally pretty well protected by fair use.
[987.12 --> 989.40]  The nature of the copyrighted work here is movie,
[989.50 --> 991.10]  so that's very separate from how it's being used.
[991.18 --> 994.04]  And the effect on the works value is arguably very little.
[994.36 --> 997.38]  Now, the problem with all of that is it's all gray.
[997.96 --> 1001.32]  And fair use, rather than being just a hard and fast law,
[1001.32 --> 1005.16]  is an argument that you have to defend in court.
[1005.42 --> 1008.96]  So if someone issues a DMCA takedown,
[1009.26 --> 1011.60]  the only way to dispute it,
[1012.08 --> 1014.82]  if you say, no, this is fair use,
[1014.96 --> 1016.92]  and they say, um, actually it's not,
[1017.18 --> 1018.84]  is to take them to court
[1018.84 --> 1021.20]  and have the courts agree with you.
[1021.36 --> 1023.28]  So now, this has been a very long story.
[1023.36 --> 1025.08]  We're finally coming back to the issue
[1025.08 --> 1027.70]  with H3H3's critique video
[1027.70 --> 1032.12]  of this weird guy's video that he uploaded that was dumb.
[1032.66 --> 1034.78]  Um, he won, basically.
[1035.20 --> 1036.92]  So even though he had uploaded
[1036.92 --> 1039.54]  almost the entire original video
[1039.54 --> 1042.06]  and was just kind of
[1042.06 --> 1046.12]  interspersing his reactions to it,
[1046.46 --> 1048.38]  that was still considered critique
[1048.38 --> 1050.22]  and it was still considered transformative,
[1050.48 --> 1054.32]  a reaction video was deemed to be original content,
[1054.56 --> 1056.40]  even though it was heavily dependent
[1056.40 --> 1058.76]  on the original copyrighted work.
[1059.76 --> 1060.62]  All right.
[1061.60 --> 1064.60]  So, how does this figure into Kyle's thing?
[1064.60 --> 1070.02]  Basically, Vox Media pulled a full douche move here
[1070.02 --> 1071.98]  and issued a DMCA takedown
[1071.98 --> 1076.36]  for what has been maybe not proven,
[1076.68 --> 1079.36]  but at least preliminarily tested by the courts
[1079.36 --> 1085.48]  to be a fair use rebroadcast of a copyrighted work.
[1085.90 --> 1087.84]  And the only reason I can think of
[1087.84 --> 1088.90]  that they would do that,
[1089.02 --> 1090.90]  aside from just, um,
[1090.90 --> 1094.78]  just being embarrassed and acting out of
[1094.78 --> 1097.12]  sort of, uh, like initial knee-jerk reaction,
[1097.20 --> 1097.88]  which they clearly didn't
[1097.88 --> 1098.78]  because it's been a couple months.
[1098.88 --> 1099.54]  It's been a while, yeah.
[1099.66 --> 1101.58]  Is either because they are ignorant
[1101.58 --> 1104.98]  of this sort of pre-existing case
[1104.98 --> 1108.20]  or because they are just trying to bully
[1108.20 --> 1111.76]  and intimidate a much, much smaller outfit
[1111.76 --> 1114.62]  into just not disputing it
[1114.62 --> 1116.94]  because they're afraid that if they do dispute it,
[1117.04 --> 1119.52]  the next step is court fees.
[1119.52 --> 1122.80]  Neither of those are great.
[1123.68 --> 1126.14]  Um, and honestly, I mean,
[1126.20 --> 1128.24]  I can't, I can't speak to the mindset
[1128.24 --> 1129.78]  of the executives at Vox Media
[1129.78 --> 1132.28]  or whoever it is that ultimately, um,
[1132.36 --> 1133.40]  decided to do this,
[1133.46 --> 1135.44]  but my gut feeling is that
[1135.44 --> 1137.50]  they were just going pure intimidation factor.
[1137.86 --> 1139.72]  Because I can, I can tell you guys,
[1139.80 --> 1143.08]  as someone who was a much smaller,
[1143.18 --> 1144.42]  like, we're at a point now
[1144.42 --> 1146.30]  where if someone came after us,
[1146.32 --> 1148.18]  like an H3, we could say,
[1148.18 --> 1149.86]  okay, see you in court, buddy.
[1150.56 --> 1151.00]  Fine.
[1151.32 --> 1152.20]  If that's how it's going to be,
[1152.30 --> 1153.04]  that's how it's going to be.
[1153.36 --> 1154.22]  Let's do it.
[1154.54 --> 1155.00]  Let's dance.
[1155.40 --> 1158.04]  But there was a time when we weren't.
[1158.12 --> 1160.76]  And I remember getting these kinds of,
[1160.76 --> 1163.26]  uh, you know, strikes or content ID notices
[1163.26 --> 1165.38]  and being like, is this it?
[1166.34 --> 1168.72]  Is this the end of this company?
[1168.94 --> 1169.14]  Yeah.
[1169.18 --> 1170.58]  Because that's what it would have been.
[1170.80 --> 1171.60]  It gets really scary.
[1172.10 --> 1173.30]  It's absolutely scary.
[1173.30 --> 1175.04]  And it's been happening to people
[1175.04 --> 1177.50]  where it has resulted in being the end of them.
[1178.78 --> 1181.26]  In regards to being a content creator.
[1182.18 --> 1183.06]  So, um.
[1183.06 --> 1184.12]  At least on that platform.
[1185.40 --> 1185.80]  Basically.
[1186.26 --> 1188.14]  Apparently The Verge has an official response.
[1188.32 --> 1189.18]  Do they really?
[1189.48 --> 1191.56]  Yo, uh, no YOLO snail.
[1191.90 --> 1193.40]  I do not think we have seen their official response.
[1193.40 --> 1194.40]  Oh, I would love to see.
[1194.46 --> 1195.68]  Do you want to, do you want to fire that up
[1195.68 --> 1196.74]  while, uh, while I go ahead?
[1196.74 --> 1197.48]  I'm going to try to find it, yeah.
[1197.48 --> 1199.24]  Yeah, I was going to finish up a couple thoughts.
[1199.36 --> 1205.34]  So, so basically this leaves the, the, the DMCA takedown system, um,
[1205.72 --> 1209.90]  open to abuse by copyright owners who just want to,
[1210.50 --> 1213.18]  in some cases, just remove something that they don't like.
[1213.56 --> 1215.16]  So, um, here's one.
[1215.40 --> 1217.68]  Uh, PewDiePie got copyright striked by,
[1217.86 --> 1219.28]  because a Twitch streamer took offense.
[1219.82 --> 1223.36]  Um, there was one YouTuber who was extorted for money
[1223.36 --> 1225.92]  through bonus, through bogus copyright strikes.
[1225.92 --> 1227.72]  And I moved, that's funny.
[1227.80 --> 1229.20]  Even not through YouTube system.
[1229.36 --> 1232.34]  We had, um, some copyright holder for some, like,
[1232.48 --> 1235.34]  classical sheet music in Germany come after us demanding,
[1235.46 --> 1237.94]  I think it was like $10,000 or something stupid like that,
[1238.04 --> 1240.94]  for a song that we used in a video
[1240.94 --> 1243.62]  that was actually from YouTube's music library.
[1243.72 --> 1245.34]  This was a couple years back, a few years back.
[1246.00 --> 1249.24]  Um, and I was super upset because I was like,
[1249.30 --> 1250.74]  okay, I don't really understand how this works.
[1251.12 --> 1254.46]  International music copyright law, crazy complicated,
[1254.46 --> 1256.40]  because they're separate copyrights for the performance,
[1256.74 --> 1258.18]  for the original sheet music.
[1258.80 --> 1261.34]  Um, and, uh, and I was like,
[1261.40 --> 1263.28]  I was looking at it going, well, this is, this is ridiculous.
[1263.28 --> 1266.04]  Because I'd be happy to pay some kind of fee
[1266.04 --> 1267.70]  because, yeah, we did use the sheet music,
[1267.86 --> 1271.16]  but $10,000 or whatever it was, like, that's extortionate.
[1271.22 --> 1273.28]  Like, we, we made a fraction of that
[1273.28 --> 1274.52]  off the AdSense of the video
[1274.52 --> 1277.24]  and the sponsors that we inserted into it.
[1277.28 --> 1280.24]  How can you possibly expect me to pay you more than I made?
[1280.56 --> 1282.32]  Well, then you shouldn't have used the song in the first place.
[1282.32 --> 1285.12]  Ultimately, we just didn't pay because we kind of figured
[1285.12 --> 1289.34]  some rando, uh, holding company,
[1289.52 --> 1291.38]  like, copyright holder in Germany,
[1291.38 --> 1292.76]  what are they going to ultimately do to us?
[1292.80 --> 1294.60]  Like, fly their lawyers out here and, like,
[1294.64 --> 1295.48]  come on, you've got to be kidding me.
[1295.88 --> 1297.52]  Um, and they didn't end up following it up,
[1297.64 --> 1301.14]  but, um, we were, again, we were in a position
[1301.14 --> 1303.06]  where we could afford to take that risk.
[1303.12 --> 1304.28]  You want me to go ahead and screen share you?
[1305.28 --> 1305.72]  Sure.
[1305.72 --> 1307.32]  Uh, uh,
[1307.44 --> 1310.02]  All right.
[1310.02 --> 1313.16]  It's basically a big wall of text,
[1313.22 --> 1315.02]  so there isn't a ton for you guys to look at,
[1315.16 --> 1317.14]  but, uh, what they're saying is
[1317.14 --> 1318.82]  the legal team,
[1319.28 --> 1320.58]  Vox Media's legal team,
[1320.72 --> 1323.02]  who was very diligent and protective of their work,
[1323.44 --> 1325.96]  um, was made aware of
[1325.96 --> 1328.84]  some PC video reaction stuff,
[1329.32 --> 1330.24]  um, and filed text-downs.
[1330.24 --> 1332.56]  Did not meet our standards and had,
[1332.66 --> 1334.08]  oh, oh, oh, that, sorry, uh,
[1334.08 --> 1335.10]  so they pulled their stuff.
[1335.22 --> 1335.90]  Okay, cool, cool.
[1336.00 --> 1336.86]  Okay, I misread that.
[1337.04 --> 1337.22]  Cool.
[1337.22 --> 1339.20]  Yeah, yeah, no, that comment was actually totally fine.
[1339.58 --> 1340.78]  Um, apparently it was,
[1340.84 --> 1342.28]  it was two videos, as far as I know,
[1342.72 --> 1344.14]  um, said,
[1344.24 --> 1347.12]  those two videos used 90% of our footage
[1347.12 --> 1348.18]  without any edits,
[1348.72 --> 1351.88]  um, cuts or other transformative use.
[1352.54 --> 1353.74]  One in particular is featured
[1353.74 --> 1355.76]  what our legal team felt was
[1355.76 --> 1357.30]  a pretty racist character.
[1358.58 --> 1359.42]  Um, I, so he-
[1359.42 --> 1361.42]  Okay, I can't necessarily disagree with that,
[1361.46 --> 1362.84]  but it's also, like, none of your business.
[1363.06 --> 1365.30]  He didn't edit their footage,
[1365.30 --> 1367.12]  but I think in reviewing footage,
[1367.22 --> 1369.30]  that's probably the more respectful thing to do,
[1369.44 --> 1371.28]  and he cut himself in,
[1371.44 --> 1373.36]  which is probably exactly what should have been done.
[1373.76 --> 1375.16]  Um, anyways, uh,
[1375.16 --> 1376.26]  there was also a complaint,
[1376.36 --> 1377.82]  I don't remember exactly where they said it,
[1378.10 --> 1380.18]  of where everything could have been avoided
[1380.18 --> 1382.36]  if they just reached out to this person.
[1383.76 --> 1386.22]  How would I know to reach out to Nylee Patel?
[1386.50 --> 1386.72]  Yeah.
[1387.48 --> 1387.84]  Okay.
[1388.32 --> 1389.98]  And besides, here's something.
[1390.10 --> 1390.46]  You know what?
[1390.46 --> 1391.30]  No, hold on a minute.
[1392.24 --> 1393.74]  Okay, Nylee.
[1394.44 --> 1394.80]  Um.
[1394.80 --> 1395.34]  Nylee, Nylee.
[1396.36 --> 1398.96]  Why didn't you reach out to Kyle
[1398.96 --> 1400.44]  if you had a problem?
[1400.70 --> 1402.48]  A lot of times, to be completely honest,
[1402.66 --> 1404.62]  um, and you don't want to use it all that often,
[1404.78 --> 1405.98]  but being a creator,
[1406.18 --> 1407.20]  sometimes Twitter is, like,
[1407.24 --> 1408.70]  one of your most useful things.
[1408.96 --> 1409.16]  Yeah.
[1409.16 --> 1410.64]  Because things don't get done,
[1410.74 --> 1411.58]  and then you tweet about it,
[1411.62 --> 1412.88]  then it gets done very fast.
[1413.02 --> 1415.16]  Or, better yet, you could just-
[1415.16 --> 1417.34]  I guarantee Kyle has an email address
[1417.34 --> 1418.50]  on his YouTube channel
[1418.50 --> 1419.72]  that you can use to email him.
[1420.20 --> 1423.82]  99% of the medium to large creators
[1423.82 --> 1425.52]  that I've been made aware of
[1425.52 --> 1427.00]  do have such a thing.
[1427.14 --> 1427.90]  I'm just-
[1427.90 --> 1428.76]  I'm curious now.
[1429.20 --> 1429.70]  But anyway,
[1429.76 --> 1431.22]  I'm going to throw it back on your screen.
[1433.14 --> 1434.28]  So you're sharing.
[1435.08 --> 1437.64]  Yeah, so the specific quote about that part is,
[1437.68 --> 1438.84]  I want to address a situation
[1438.84 --> 1440.66]  around some YouTube copyright strikes
[1440.66 --> 1442.26]  since retracted,
[1442.32 --> 1443.76]  which is true as far as I know,
[1444.16 --> 1446.10]  issued by The Verge and Vox Media
[1446.10 --> 1447.36]  that have gotten pretty toxic
[1447.36 --> 1448.44]  and could have been avoided
[1448.44 --> 1449.48]  if the parties involved
[1449.48 --> 1451.20]  had simply reached out to me directly.
[1455.80 --> 1457.64]  Again, there was the 90% of our footage
[1457.64 --> 1458.68]  without any edits, cuts,
[1458.74 --> 1460.14]  or otherwise transformative use,
[1460.58 --> 1462.70]  and one of them featured a particular-
[1462.70 --> 1463.60]  that the legal team said
[1463.60 --> 1464.76]  was a particularly racist character.
[1465.08 --> 1467.18]  Again, I don't think anyone
[1467.18 --> 1468.84]  in any form of review
[1468.84 --> 1470.84]  would want to edit the original footage.
[1470.92 --> 1472.18]  I don't think that's the point at all.
[1472.24 --> 1473.46]  Kyle does not have an email
[1473.46 --> 1474.40]  on his YouTube page.
[1474.40 --> 1476.14]  He does have an address, though,
[1476.24 --> 1477.40]  and he does have his Twitter.
[1477.52 --> 1478.26]  So, yep, you're right.
[1478.34 --> 1479.42]  Twitter would have been the way to go here.
[1480.38 --> 1480.70]  All right.
[1481.10 --> 1481.80]  Pretty easy.
[1481.92 --> 1482.28]  Fair point.
[1482.90 --> 1484.78]  I bet you Nyle has a Twitter.
[1487.62 --> 1489.60]  YouTube notified the two channels in question,
[1490.08 --> 1491.64]  said there was a chance
[1491.64 --> 1493.18]  our request wouldn't make it through,
[1493.62 --> 1494.70]  and our legal team-
[1494.70 --> 1496.42]  Asked our legal team for their case.
[1497.18 --> 1498.58]  Our team made the case.
[1498.66 --> 1500.08]  YouTube agreed the videos were not fair use
[1500.08 --> 1500.80]  and issued the strikes.
[1504.20 --> 1505.66]  When this was brought to my attention
[1505.66 --> 1507.02]  a few hours later,
[1507.10 --> 1508.12]  I told them that although
[1508.12 --> 1510.24]  I fully agreed with their legal argument,
[1510.52 --> 1511.66]  I did not think we should use
[1511.66 --> 1513.30]  copyright strikes against legitimate channels,
[1513.46 --> 1515.54]  even if we thought the videos crossed the line.
[1515.88 --> 1517.54]  And again, I fully agree with our legal team
[1517.54 --> 1519.12]  that these videos crossed the line of fair use.
[1519.20 --> 1520.82]  So basically, they-
[1520.82 --> 1521.72]  Wow.
[1522.18 --> 1522.50]  Okay.
[1522.58 --> 1523.08]  So basically,
[1523.08 --> 1524.20]  they haven't learned anything.
[1524.54 --> 1524.80]  Yeah.
[1524.80 --> 1529.68]  So here's the thing.
[1530.24 --> 1531.64]  Whether or whether or not,
[1531.82 --> 1531.84]  like,
[1532.04 --> 1534.88]  does this post
[1534.88 --> 1536.50]  actually say
[1536.50 --> 1538.18]  that their lawyers felt like
[1538.18 --> 1540.06]  the character was racist?
[1540.28 --> 1541.20]  Because that has
[1541.20 --> 1543.92]  nothing to do-
[1543.92 --> 1545.76]  It does,
[1545.86 --> 1547.26]  but I don't think that was a reason
[1547.26 --> 1548.12]  for the action.
[1548.70 --> 1549.08]  Okay.
[1549.30 --> 1550.72]  So I don't think it actually applies.
[1550.80 --> 1551.48]  It does say that.
[1552.22 --> 1553.02]  Our legal team felt
[1553.02 --> 1554.16]  this was not fair use,
[1554.16 --> 1554.82]  and,
[1555.02 --> 1555.68]  oh yeah,
[1557.10 --> 1557.98]  those two reactions?
[1558.18 --> 1558.56]  Oh, okay.
[1558.62 --> 1559.18]  One of them in particular.
[1559.18 --> 1559.74]  Which are legal-
[1559.74 --> 1560.84]  What our legal team felt
[1560.84 --> 1561.94]  was a pretty racist character.
[1562.08 --> 1562.96]  Yeah, but you don't get to-
[1562.96 --> 1563.90]  You don't get to just let
[1563.90 --> 1565.00]  your personal sensitivities
[1565.00 --> 1567.24]  get involved in a legal issue.
[1567.70 --> 1567.92]  Yeah.
[1567.98 --> 1569.06]  So whether or not it's fair use
[1569.06 --> 1570.20]  actually doesn't really have anything
[1570.20 --> 1571.02]  to do with
[1571.02 --> 1572.24]  whether you like the character
[1572.24 --> 1573.28]  being portrayed or not.
[1573.50 --> 1573.66]  Yeah.
[1573.82 --> 1574.44]  Also, I mean,
[1574.48 --> 1575.42]  there's a whole-
[1575.42 --> 1575.84]  I mean,
[1575.88 --> 1577.88]  we could have a whole conversation
[1577.88 --> 1579.68]  that I'm-
[1579.68 --> 1580.70]  It's probably best
[1580.70 --> 1582.38]  that I personally stay out of
[1582.38 --> 1583.80]  about whether or not
[1583.80 --> 1585.28]  it's a racist character
[1585.28 --> 1587.40]  if the person
[1587.40 --> 1588.70]  happens to be
[1588.70 --> 1590.30]  of at least
[1590.30 --> 1591.62]  partially the race
[1591.62 --> 1593.04]  that they are making fun of.
[1593.46 --> 1593.78]  I mean,
[1593.80 --> 1594.98]  are you gonna tell me that,
[1595.04 --> 1595.32]  like,
[1595.82 --> 1596.70]  a Jewish comedian
[1596.70 --> 1597.78]  is not allowed to make
[1597.78 --> 1598.84]  Jewish mother jokes,
[1598.92 --> 1599.44]  for example?
[1599.74 --> 1600.46]  Are you gonna-
[1600.46 --> 1601.56]  are you gonna say that?
[1602.34 --> 1603.86]  It seems pretty-
[1603.86 --> 1604.82]  it seems like
[1604.82 --> 1607.04]  kind of a dumb thing to say.
[1609.12 --> 1610.22]  What does have
[1610.22 --> 1611.54]  strong evidence in here
[1611.54 --> 1612.62]  of straight up
[1612.62 --> 1614.40]  screenshot emails
[1614.40 --> 1615.54]  is
[1615.54 --> 1619.02]  technically in here
[1619.02 --> 1619.90]  it doesn't say-
[1619.90 --> 1620.96]  because he blurred out his email
[1620.96 --> 1621.66]  which is-
[1621.66 --> 1622.16]  or her,
[1622.28 --> 1622.44]  sorry,
[1622.50 --> 1622.98]  I don't actually know
[1622.98 --> 1623.50]  who this is.
[1623.50 --> 1624.74]  but it blurred out
[1624.74 --> 1626.50]  their email
[1626.50 --> 1627.36]  so I'm not 100% sure
[1627.36 --> 1627.76]  it was them
[1627.76 --> 1628.58]  but that doesn't matter.
[1628.86 --> 1629.44]  It looks like someone
[1629.44 --> 1630.10]  from a
[1630.10 --> 1631.38]  at voxmedia.com
[1631.38 --> 1632.14]  email account
[1632.14 --> 1634.22]  retracted
[1634.22 --> 1635.08]  the copyright infringement.
[1635.20 --> 1635.96]  So it wasn't YouTube
[1635.96 --> 1637.70]  that agreed with Kyle.
[1638.12 --> 1638.96]  It was clearly
[1638.96 --> 1640.10]  someone from Vox
[1640.10 --> 1641.00]  retracting
[1641.00 --> 1641.98]  the claim.
[1642.12 --> 1642.38]  Okay,
[1642.54 --> 1643.10]  hold on a second.
[1643.20 --> 1644.80]  Meridian in the chat,
[1644.92 --> 1645.96]  I gotta disagree with you.
[1646.10 --> 1647.40]  An Asian faking an accent
[1647.40 --> 1648.20]  of another Asian
[1648.20 --> 1649.30]  that can't speak English
[1649.30 --> 1650.68]  in the normal way
[1650.68 --> 1651.70]  is just as racist
[1651.70 --> 1652.88]  as if a white guy did it.
[1652.88 --> 1653.28]  LULZ
[1653.28 --> 1653.84]  but that has nothing
[1653.84 --> 1654.84]  to do with legality here.
[1655.36 --> 1656.46]  It's actually not.
[1656.86 --> 1657.34]  Racist
[1657.34 --> 1658.36]  is to do with
[1658.36 --> 1659.38]  race.
[1660.54 --> 1661.90]  Making fun of someone's accent,
[1662.02 --> 1662.14]  yeah,
[1662.20 --> 1663.10]  it's rude.
[1663.56 --> 1664.66]  It's really rude.
[1666.54 --> 1667.02]  Yeah,
[1667.08 --> 1667.58]  but there's-
[1667.58 --> 1668.50]  But it's not race.
[1668.54 --> 1669.04]  I guess with-
[1669.04 --> 1669.16]  yeah,
[1669.22 --> 1669.68]  with that-
[1669.68 --> 1669.90]  yeah.
[1669.96 --> 1670.52]  So let's just-
[1670.52 --> 1671.40]  let's just make sure
[1671.40 --> 1672.14]  that we're not getting
[1672.14 --> 1673.18]  our terminology wires
[1673.18 --> 1673.88]  crossed here.
[1674.68 --> 1675.40]  It's not race.
[1675.40 --> 1676.72]  Accent is where you're from.
[1677.30 --> 1677.58]  Yes.
[1678.14 --> 1679.22]  Or in some cases,
[1679.74 --> 1680.42]  not even.
[1681.00 --> 1681.28]  Yeah,
[1681.38 --> 1682.14]  because you could make-
[1682.14 --> 1682.88]  my wife is
[1682.88 --> 1684.18]  not from Canada,
[1684.56 --> 1685.72]  most assuredly speaks
[1685.72 --> 1687.00]  with a West Coast
[1687.00 --> 1687.66]  Canadian accent.
[1687.74 --> 1688.80]  Like where you spent
[1688.80 --> 1690.06]  your formative years,
[1690.20 --> 1691.12]  most of your formative years?
[1691.12 --> 1692.12]  But to say that
[1692.12 --> 1692.84]  it would be-
[1692.84 --> 1693.22]  I don't know.
[1693.70 --> 1694.06]  Like,
[1694.74 --> 1695.30]  um,
[1695.82 --> 1696.10]  yeah.
[1698.42 --> 1698.94]  Anyways.
[1698.94 --> 1699.40]  Okay, anyway.
[1700.18 --> 1700.66]  Again,
[1700.76 --> 1702.06]  the strikes were retracted
[1702.06 --> 1703.46]  at my specific instruction.
[1703.46 --> 1704.46]  That seems to be true.
[1704.96 --> 1705.94]  Not through any
[1705.94 --> 1707.26]  YouTube dispute process
[1707.26 --> 1708.34]  also seems to be true.
[1708.94 --> 1709.60]  The Verge has written
[1709.60 --> 1710.26]  many times
[1710.26 --> 1710.88]  about the problems
[1710.88 --> 1711.40]  with YouTube's
[1711.40 --> 1712.48]  copyright enforcement mechanism
[1712.48 --> 1713.90]  and I do not think
[1713.90 --> 1714.96]  it works well enough
[1714.96 --> 1715.70]  for us to use it
[1715.70 --> 1716.62]  in cases like this.
[1717.60 --> 1717.92]  Okay.
[1718.42 --> 1719.92]  One thing I did not do
[1719.92 --> 1720.80]  was tweet about it
[1720.80 --> 1721.94]  because I didn't think
[1721.94 --> 1723.40]  the nuance of the situation
[1723.40 --> 1724.52]  would lend itself to tweets
[1724.52 --> 1725.34]  and also-
[1725.34 --> 1726.06]  Are we still reading
[1726.06 --> 1726.62]  this garbage?
[1726.80 --> 1727.20]  Sure.
[1727.48 --> 1727.82]  Oh, man.
[1727.82 --> 1728.30]  And also,
[1728.40 --> 1728.96]  quite honestly,
[1729.14 --> 1730.58]  because I didn't think
[1730.58 --> 1731.78]  it was a big deal.
[1732.50 --> 1733.32]  There were strikes
[1733.32 --> 1734.30]  and the strikes were retracted.
[1734.34 --> 1734.88]  I assumed everyone
[1734.88 --> 1735.52]  would move on.
[1735.52 --> 1737.22]  Well, this article
[1737.22 --> 1738.36]  is not making it better.
[1738.78 --> 1741.30]  Just if you want my two cents.
[1741.36 --> 1742.00]  And just to be clear-
[1742.00 --> 1742.64]  Which you probably don't.
[1743.26 --> 1744.04]  Sending a strike-
[1744.04 --> 1744.24]  Wait, wait, wait.
[1744.26 --> 1744.54]  Hold on.
[1744.62 --> 1745.38]  If we have these words
[1745.38 --> 1745.82]  on screen,
[1746.42 --> 1747.38]  is this fair use?
[1748.04 --> 1748.70]  Get the words
[1748.70 --> 1749.32]  off the screen.
[1749.88 --> 1750.14]  Ah!
[1750.70 --> 1750.98]  Ah!
[1750.98 --> 1752.46]  We used 90% of the words!
[1752.94 --> 1754.08]  Is my character racist?
[1754.54 --> 1755.86]  I don't know about that there, bud.
[1756.20 --> 1757.68]  Is that a racist character there, bud?
[1758.24 --> 1760.06]  Oh, we got a big problem there, bud.
[1760.26 --> 1760.94]  I think the problem
[1760.94 --> 1762.00]  is you're just 10-ply, bud.
[1762.32 --> 1763.12]  Oh, no, bud.
[1763.46 --> 1764.80]  You want to go for a rip there, bud?
[1765.52 --> 1768.08]  Oh, jeez.
[1768.20 --> 1768.42]  Yeah.
[1768.54 --> 1769.10]  Oh, man.
[1770.18 --> 1770.52]  I guess...
[1772.20 --> 1773.36]  Okay.
[1773.68 --> 1774.34]  Are we done here?
[1774.74 --> 1776.30]  I mean, we can be.
[1779.58 --> 1780.56]  Reading it out directly
[1780.56 --> 1782.64]  is probably going to be...
[1782.64 --> 1783.34]  I don't know.
[1783.44 --> 1783.78]  Who knows?
[1784.96 --> 1785.32]  Yeah.
[1785.66 --> 1786.32]  That whole thing's too big.
[1786.32 --> 1786.58]  Okay.
[1786.70 --> 1787.66]  So what I was going to say
[1787.66 --> 1789.42]  is that there were strikes,
[1789.52 --> 1790.60]  the strikes were retracted thing.
[1790.64 --> 1790.76]  Yeah.
[1790.84 --> 1791.56]  Yeah, but they weren't
[1791.56 --> 1792.74]  retracted immediately.
[1792.86 --> 1793.36]  And they were...
[1793.36 --> 1794.20]  Retracted very quickly.
[1794.32 --> 1795.92]  I will 100% give you that
[1795.92 --> 1796.38]  if you're watching,
[1796.46 --> 1797.00]  which you're probably not.
[1797.38 --> 1799.04]  But they weren't retracted immediately.
[1799.24 --> 1802.00]  And strikes are a direct attack
[1802.00 --> 1802.54]  Yes.
[1802.66 --> 1804.56]  on someone's income and stability.
[1804.94 --> 1806.16]  Three strikes and you are out.
[1806.38 --> 1807.66]  Kyle just bought a house.
[1807.92 --> 1809.40]  Yo, he certainly did.
[1810.04 --> 1810.88]  This is scary.
[1810.88 --> 1814.24]  And strikes also immediately affect your channel.
[1814.40 --> 1815.78]  One strike and you can't live stream.
[1816.10 --> 1816.36]  Yeah.
[1816.98 --> 1817.92]  Just like that.
[1818.02 --> 1819.94]  Like it's a big problem.
[1820.06 --> 1820.84]  It's not okay.
[1821.12 --> 1821.28]  Yeah.
[1821.50 --> 1822.10]  That's a...
[1822.10 --> 1823.34]  It's an attack.
[1823.48 --> 1824.64]  It is straight up an attack.
[1824.72 --> 1825.64]  And the other thing too
[1825.64 --> 1827.40]  is that there are alternatives
[1827.40 --> 1828.94]  to copyright...
[1828.94 --> 1830.72]  to DMCA taking down something
[1830.72 --> 1832.54]  that don't result in a strike.
[1832.66 --> 1833.78]  Like doing the thing that you said
[1833.78 --> 1834.72]  at the beginning of your article
[1834.72 --> 1836.44]  of reaching out directly to Kyle.
[1836.64 --> 1837.78]  Yeah, that's an option.
[1837.78 --> 1839.50]  But I don't know.
[1839.54 --> 1840.50]  He's a pretty racist guy.
[1840.56 --> 1841.62]  They probably don't want to talk to him.
[1842.88 --> 1843.14]  Lyle.
[1843.26 --> 1844.08]  Lyle can be mean.
[1844.22 --> 1844.80]  Yeah, Lyle.
[1844.94 --> 1846.14]  Lyle's a rude dude.
[1847.52 --> 1848.80]  The Virges YouTube channel
[1848.80 --> 1850.14]  has since been brigaded
[1850.14 --> 1851.86]  with dislikes and nasty comments.
[1852.08 --> 1853.80]  And there are now death threats
[1853.80 --> 1854.90]  we have to think about.
[1855.00 --> 1855.54]  Here's one.
[1855.78 --> 1856.98]  Good luck staying alive.
[1857.08 --> 1858.00]  The internet doesn't forget.
[1858.00 --> 1859.68]  Just to be super clear about that one.
[1859.88 --> 1860.44]  How is that?
[1860.58 --> 1861.34]  99% sure.
[1861.64 --> 1862.72]  That means the site.
[1862.82 --> 1864.88]  The site and the YouTube channel.
[1865.14 --> 1865.94]  Not you.
[1866.62 --> 1867.42]  Think you're okay.
[1867.80 --> 1868.92]  At least with that one.
[1869.84 --> 1871.22]  That's the only one shown here.
[1871.32 --> 1872.66]  So at least with that one.
[1874.98 --> 1875.72]  Oh, man.
[1875.74 --> 1876.00]  Yeah.
[1876.26 --> 1877.36]  It was all pretty disappointing.
[1877.64 --> 1878.34]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[1879.36 --> 1880.94]  Simply ask me about it.
[1880.96 --> 1882.26]  You should have asked him about it
[1882.26 --> 1883.54]  before attacking.
[1884.70 --> 1885.92]  I hope everyone involved
[1885.92 --> 1886.76]  can take a moment
[1886.76 --> 1888.60]  and think about making sure
[1888.60 --> 1889.92]  they actually know
[1889.92 --> 1891.54]  what they think they know
[1891.54 --> 1893.88]  and the value of communicating directly
[1893.88 --> 1895.60]  instead of just simply reacting.
[1895.60 --> 1900.36]  It's just...
[1900.36 --> 1901.64]  That was gold.
[1901.78 --> 1903.30]  The end of that was just gold.
[1903.60 --> 1904.16]  I just...
[1904.16 --> 1905.70]  I don't even think I need to
[1905.70 --> 1907.10]  talk about that part.
[1907.40 --> 1908.40]  That's just...
[1908.40 --> 1909.56]  That's...
[1909.56 --> 1910.56]  That whole...
[1910.56 --> 1911.14]  Oh, man.
[1911.36 --> 1912.98]  Ending it with that was great.
[1912.98 --> 1914.48]  Thank you.
[1915.02 --> 1916.40]  That was fantastic.
[1918.64 --> 1919.50]  Oh, man.
[1919.66 --> 1921.04]  I couldn't have...
[1921.04 --> 1922.98]  I don't even know.
[1922.98 --> 1924.32]  I couldn't have requested
[1924.32 --> 1926.32]  a better last paragraph.
[1926.32 --> 1927.26]  All right.
[1927.44 --> 1929.38]  So now, let's move on
[1929.38 --> 1930.46]  to a controversy
[1930.46 --> 1932.64]  that I woke up to
[1932.64 --> 1934.20]  on the forum this morning.
[1934.44 --> 1934.82]  This is...
[1934.82 --> 1935.96]  I'm very interested in this
[1935.96 --> 1936.96]  because I have not heard of this.
[1936.96 --> 1937.74]  So this was posted
[1937.74 --> 1939.26]  by Firelighter487
[1939.26 --> 1940.02]  on the forum.
[1940.58 --> 1941.86]  The Linux Gamer
[1941.86 --> 1944.92]  did a response video to...
[1944.92 --> 1945.84]  I actually didn't even know
[1945.84 --> 1946.56]  about this video
[1946.56 --> 1948.22]  until I found out about it
[1948.22 --> 1949.88]  reading about this...
[1949.88 --> 1952.16]  This drama that I was embroiled in
[1952.16 --> 1953.44]  on the forum this morning.
[1954.62 --> 1955.16]  Anyway,
[1955.48 --> 1956.42]  did a response video
[1956.42 --> 1957.58]  to our Linux Gaming
[1957.58 --> 1959.12]  Finally Doesn't Suck video.
[1961.50 --> 1962.38]  And then...
[1962.38 --> 1962.52]  Oh, okay.
[1962.82 --> 1963.04]  Sorry.
[1963.24 --> 1963.76]  Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[1963.82 --> 1964.36]  Can we jump back
[1964.36 --> 1964.84]  for a split second?
[1964.84 --> 1965.08]  Yes.
[1965.16 --> 1965.94]  Can you jump to my screen?
[1966.10 --> 1966.58]  I can.
[1967.82 --> 1969.20]  Apparently, this is Nyle.
[1969.60 --> 1970.34]  Yeah, okay, cool.
[1970.36 --> 1970.92]  It's reckless.
[1971.98 --> 1973.36]  I knew his Twitter handle.
[1973.64 --> 1974.10]  I didn't actually...
[1974.10 --> 1974.42]  What do you mean
[1974.42 --> 1975.98]  before any of it went sideways?
[1976.18 --> 1977.68]  Oh, it was pretty sideways by then.
[1977.92 --> 1979.10]  We were to strike on Wednesday.
[1979.58 --> 1981.10]  When was Kyle's original...
[1982.82 --> 1983.66]  tweet?
[1984.00 --> 1985.82]  Did Paul basically post on Twitter
[1985.82 --> 1987.00]  exactly what we just said?
[1987.20 --> 1987.82]  You could have also
[1987.82 --> 1988.84]  just reached out to Kyle.
[1988.94 --> 1989.86]  Is that what I saw just there?
[1989.90 --> 1991.02]  Give me one second.
[1991.10 --> 1991.44]  Oh, boy.
[1991.56 --> 1992.62]  Yeah, you're still screen sharing.
[1992.70 --> 1993.00]  Is that cool?
[1993.06 --> 1993.78]  Yeah, I think we're fine.
[1993.88 --> 1994.44]  Okay, cool.
[1995.02 --> 1996.68]  That's the floatplane stream,
[1996.76 --> 1997.04]  by the way.
[1997.18 --> 1997.38]  Yeah.
[1997.48 --> 1997.68]  Hold on.
[1997.70 --> 1998.58]  I want to see what Paul said
[1998.58 --> 1999.26]  at the beginning here.
[2001.52 --> 2003.10]  This all could have been avoided
[2003.10 --> 2004.08]  if the party's involved.
[2004.34 --> 2005.12]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2005.16 --> 2005.54]  Love it.
[2005.58 --> 2006.36]  I love you, Paul.
[2006.42 --> 2006.88]  You're awesome.
[2007.14 --> 2007.88]  You're awesome, dude.
[2008.10 --> 2008.96]  Good job, Paul.
[2009.32 --> 2010.44]  But yeah, so apparently,
[2010.56 --> 2011.80]  the strike was pulled back
[2011.80 --> 2013.52]  on Wednesday by Nyle.
[2013.90 --> 2014.26]  Yeah.
[2014.26 --> 2017.98]  But it happened on Tuesday.
[2018.10 --> 2019.44]  That is really fast turnaround,
[2019.56 --> 2020.32]  to be completely honest.
[2020.52 --> 2021.34]  That might have been like
[2021.34 --> 2022.70]  right when he was made aware of it,
[2022.82 --> 2023.28]  to be clear.
[2023.78 --> 2024.38]  It might have been.
[2024.66 --> 2025.00]  Might have been.
[2025.02 --> 2026.16]  That is quite fast turnaround.
[2026.64 --> 2027.68]  But it still happened.
[2028.70 --> 2030.98]  And yeah, I don't know.
[2031.22 --> 2032.16]  Dude doesn't own Vox.
[2032.30 --> 2033.92]  He's editor-in-chief of The Verge.
[2034.18 --> 2035.34]  And that was Vox Lawyers.
[2035.70 --> 2037.04]  So it might have happened
[2037.04 --> 2038.30]  completely unbeknownst to him.
[2038.40 --> 2039.16]  I don't remember exactly
[2039.16 --> 2039.82]  what he said about that
[2039.82 --> 2040.28]  in the article,
[2040.40 --> 2041.64]  but he might have literally said that.
[2041.64 --> 2044.30]  I don't know.
[2044.56 --> 2046.20]  But yeah, we can move on.
[2046.28 --> 2047.36]  Now we can talk about...
[2047.36 --> 2048.12]  Important context.
[2048.68 --> 2049.92]  Now we can talk about this video,
[2050.06 --> 2050.94]  where the Linux gamer
[2050.94 --> 2051.80]  uploaded this thing.
[2051.88 --> 2052.78]  Full screen claimed
[2052.78 --> 2055.14]  my Linus Tech Tips response video.
[2057.30 --> 2060.24]  So basically,
[2060.54 --> 2062.34]  some people were pretty upset.
[2062.56 --> 2064.48]  Some people kind of understood it,
[2064.54 --> 2065.60]  but a lot of people
[2065.60 --> 2066.92]  were drawing parallels
[2066.92 --> 2069.48]  to the situation
[2069.48 --> 2070.70]  between Vox Media
[2070.70 --> 2071.72]  and Kyle.
[2074.26 --> 2075.96]  Let's just have a look here.
[2076.88 --> 2078.06]  Some people were like
[2078.06 --> 2079.78]  particularly mad.
[2080.34 --> 2082.26]  Let's see if I can find any of that.
[2083.12 --> 2084.68]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[2084.68 --> 2085.58]  So sorry, wait, what happened?
[2085.68 --> 2087.08]  So far, this is mostly discussion
[2087.08 --> 2088.78]  of like the content
[2088.78 --> 2090.28]  of his response video
[2090.28 --> 2093.04]  and like whether our video was okay
[2093.04 --> 2095.30]  and whether, you know, whatever.
[2095.30 --> 2098.88]  Here's discussion of whether or not
[2098.88 --> 2099.88]  we have any kind of partnership
[2099.88 --> 2100.42]  with Fullscreen.
[2100.52 --> 2102.76]  Yes, we joined the Fullscreen
[2102.76 --> 2103.72]  multi-channel network
[2103.72 --> 2105.16]  like four years ago.
[2106.72 --> 2109.12]  I forget what the point of it was.
[2109.12 --> 2110.44]  I think,
[2110.68 --> 2115.42]  oh, no, I think I do remember.
[2115.64 --> 2116.34]  So we were actually,
[2116.74 --> 2118.56]  Twitch for a very short period of time
[2118.56 --> 2120.56]  actually had a YouTube MCN.
[2120.94 --> 2122.42]  So we were partnered with them
[2122.42 --> 2127.36]  and then they like dissolved that.
[2127.62 --> 2129.60]  The girl who was in charge of it
[2129.60 --> 2131.94]  was there for like six months
[2131.94 --> 2135.40]  and then just like disappeared one day.
[2135.52 --> 2136.04]  And I was like,
[2136.22 --> 2136.80]  oh, okay.
[2138.12 --> 2138.88]  Bye, I guess.
[2140.04 --> 2141.66]  Anyway, so we joined Fullscreen
[2141.66 --> 2143.14]  because some of our buddies,
[2143.36 --> 2144.56]  including Austin,
[2144.74 --> 2145.84]  were with Fullscreen at the time.
[2145.92 --> 2146.46]  They had a rep
[2146.46 --> 2147.84]  that was bringing them lots of deals
[2147.84 --> 2148.36]  and we're like,
[2148.42 --> 2149.10]  oh yeah, sure, yeah,
[2149.12 --> 2150.24]  I guess we'll be on Fullscreen too.
[2150.62 --> 2153.54]  And Fullscreen had like
[2153.54 --> 2154.62]  kind of a smooth talking,
[2155.52 --> 2157.64]  blowhard guy that was like,
[2157.68 --> 2159.16]  yeah, we're gonna have like all the tech.
[2159.28 --> 2160.28]  And I'm like, yeah, yeah, cool.
[2160.34 --> 2160.80]  You're an idiot.
[2160.80 --> 2162.80]  But like, you know, whatever.
[2163.02 --> 2164.86]  My buds are on there.
[2164.98 --> 2166.16]  So sure, why not?
[2166.64 --> 2168.34]  Anyway, shortly after we joined Fullscreen,
[2168.52 --> 2170.58]  this rep who had been doing such a great job
[2170.58 --> 2171.52]  of bringing tech deals
[2171.52 --> 2174.68]  to other tech influencers left
[2174.68 --> 2177.18]  and like kind of went direct with those guys.
[2177.36 --> 2182.74]  And then we just like never got off it.
[2182.82 --> 2183.68]  Cause it didn't really matter.
[2183.84 --> 2185.98]  So here's something that you guys might not know.
[2186.44 --> 2188.72]  Once you decouple your account from,
[2188.86 --> 2190.58]  so, okay, just to clarify,
[2190.80 --> 2194.42]  wait, I'm not sure if I can say the terms of the deal.
[2194.48 --> 2195.84]  So I won't say what the terms of our deal
[2195.84 --> 2196.54]  with Fullscreen are,
[2196.82 --> 2198.86]  but I will say that we signed our deal
[2198.86 --> 2202.60]  at a time when MCMs were much more hungrily
[2202.60 --> 2204.36]  trying to hoover up creators.
[2205.44 --> 2207.96]  And it was at a time when it was possible
[2207.96 --> 2210.30]  to get what's known as a 100% deal.
[2210.30 --> 2215.38]  So nowadays, my understanding is that the MCN takes
[2215.38 --> 2219.48]  anywhere from five or 10 or even more percent
[2219.48 --> 2220.60]  of your AdSense views.
[2220.70 --> 2222.06]  And in exchange, they're supposed to provide
[2222.06 --> 2222.92]  a bunch of services,
[2223.44 --> 2225.20]  including the one we're about to talk about,
[2225.58 --> 2228.98]  as well as bring you like larger brand deals
[2228.98 --> 2231.14]  to more than make up for that gleaning
[2231.14 --> 2232.18]  that they do off the top.
[2232.18 --> 2235.20]  But we signed on at a time when it was possible
[2235.20 --> 2237.54]  that MCMs, just to have headline creators
[2237.54 --> 2238.82]  on their networks,
[2239.16 --> 2240.80]  were signing people to crazy deals
[2240.80 --> 2242.36]  where they didn't take any share whatsoever.
[2242.92 --> 2244.02]  So our deal,
[2244.42 --> 2246.16]  I can't tell you what the terms of it are,
[2246.22 --> 2247.90]  but I can say that it is such that
[2247.90 --> 2250.22]  it doesn't bother us in any meaningful way.
[2251.16 --> 2252.72]  And something that I didn't know
[2252.72 --> 2255.26]  until I switched MCMs a couple times
[2255.26 --> 2256.74]  was that you actually lose
[2256.74 --> 2259.32]  all of your historical revenue data
[2259.32 --> 2260.78]  from your YouTube dashboard
[2260.78 --> 2262.82]  if you change your MCN,
[2263.00 --> 2264.68]  or if you get rid of your MCN
[2264.68 --> 2265.88]  and you go vanilla YouTube.
[2266.40 --> 2268.06]  So TechQuickie and Channel Super Fun
[2268.06 --> 2270.38]  are, and actually TechLinked for that matter,
[2270.58 --> 2271.38]  and LinusCatTips,
[2271.58 --> 2273.76]  are all just directly YouTube partnered
[2273.76 --> 2274.90]  with no MCN.
[2275.26 --> 2276.52]  And then LinusTechTips
[2276.52 --> 2278.52]  is on the full screen network,
[2279.06 --> 2283.40]  but we do very little with full screen.
[2283.40 --> 2286.90]  They bring us very little
[2286.90 --> 2288.64]  in terms of deals or anything.
[2288.82 --> 2289.96]  It's almost an understatement.
[2291.22 --> 2291.78]  Okay.
[2292.50 --> 2294.74]  So anyway, there's some speculation in here
[2294.74 --> 2297.08]  that we aren't on the full screen network.
[2297.30 --> 2298.02]  We are.
[2298.36 --> 2300.44]  And there's also some speculation in here
[2300.44 --> 2304.08]  that they own us,
[2304.08 --> 2307.50]  which they most certainly do not.
[2309.04 --> 2310.90]  Yeah, that's not a thing.
[2310.98 --> 2312.36]  Linus Media Group Incorporated
[2312.36 --> 2314.18]  is entirely independent
[2314.18 --> 2317.24]  and has no third-party ownership stakes
[2317.24 --> 2317.98]  in it whatsoever.
[2319.80 --> 2320.20]  Okay.
[2320.52 --> 2322.16]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[2322.32 --> 2323.16]  It's a multi-channel network.
[2323.46 --> 2324.80]  Here's a video from Game Theorists.
[2325.16 --> 2325.96]  Good old Game Theorists.
[2326.04 --> 2326.38]  Good stuff.
[2327.98 --> 2328.20]  Okay.
[2328.58 --> 2330.00]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[2330.24 --> 2331.36]  MCN handle copyright.
[2331.48 --> 2331.64]  Okay.
[2331.78 --> 2333.64]  Where are the people that are mad?
[2333.72 --> 2335.26]  I think it didn't happen until later.
[2336.34 --> 2336.90]  Here we go.
[2336.90 --> 2339.26]  Oh, no.
[2339.26 --> 2339.50]  What?
[2340.42 --> 2341.60]  Oh, misanthrope.
[2341.82 --> 2342.68]  Just so mad.
[2342.94 --> 2343.86]  So mad about everything.
[2345.38 --> 2345.82]  Okay.
[2346.46 --> 2347.24]  Okay, whatever.
[2347.36 --> 2347.66]  You know what?
[2347.68 --> 2348.92]  I can't find it right now.
[2349.22 --> 2351.40]  Basically, people were upset
[2351.40 --> 2353.72]  because they really just didn't see it.
[2353.76 --> 2354.40]  Oh, that's great.
[2354.54 --> 2354.80]  Okay.
[2354.98 --> 2355.36]  Yeah, fine.
[2355.40 --> 2355.86]  There we go.
[2356.02 --> 2356.66]  Right there.
[2356.66 --> 2362.26]  Still not a crime like perjury,
[2362.44 --> 2364.18]  which is potentially what Linus did
[2364.18 --> 2365.96]  by bringing down this,
[2366.18 --> 2369.82]  by having a content ID claim against this video.
[2370.58 --> 2371.00]  What?
[2373.36 --> 2376.54]  When did Linus lie under oath during a court hearing?
[2378.94 --> 2381.96]  For legal purposes, that's what a DMCA claim is.
[2382.16 --> 2383.22]  Lying under oath.
[2383.64 --> 2384.58]  A, no, it isn't.
[2384.58 --> 2389.10]  But B, falsely reporting a crime
[2389.10 --> 2391.38]  is basically what he's saying.
[2391.62 --> 2393.34]  But it was an automatic claim
[2393.34 --> 2395.94]  that was actually generated
[2395.94 --> 2398.32]  by YouTube's own content ID system.
[2401.02 --> 2404.32]  And yeah, so someone got it pretty right.
[2404.96 --> 2405.72]  Here we go.
[2406.18 --> 2406.62]  Spotty.
[2406.88 --> 2407.74]  Thank you, Spotty,
[2407.78 --> 2409.36]  for this excellent post here.
[2410.12 --> 2411.50]  You seem to be misinformed.
[2411.50 --> 2413.52]  There is a huge difference
[2413.52 --> 2416.22]  between a copyright strike,
[2416.52 --> 2417.90]  a DMCA takedown,
[2418.22 --> 2421.04]  and a content ID claim.
[2421.76 --> 2426.22]  So copyright strikes come from DMCA takedowns
[2426.22 --> 2429.70]  like what Vox Media did with Kyle's video,
[2429.90 --> 2432.34]  where their lawyers get together,
[2432.82 --> 2436.30]  decide it's racist and not fair use,
[2436.30 --> 2438.02]  and contact YouTube,
[2438.70 --> 2440.98]  and have that thing pulled.
[2441.70 --> 2445.04]  Content ID is an automated system
[2445.04 --> 2447.02]  based on machine learning
[2447.02 --> 2451.44]  and being fed a bunch of known content.
[2451.62 --> 2453.14]  Which is mostly designed
[2453.14 --> 2454.64]  so that if you have a bot
[2454.64 --> 2456.68]  that automatically downloads someone's videos
[2456.68 --> 2458.22]  and re-uploads them on your own channel,
[2458.30 --> 2459.14]  it's just gonna find that
[2459.14 --> 2459.48]  and be like,
[2459.56 --> 2460.32]  that's garbage,
[2460.40 --> 2461.40]  and just clean that up.
[2461.40 --> 2461.62]  Yes.
[2462.06 --> 2464.52]  And there's a big difference
[2464.52 --> 2467.42]  in what effect it actually has on the channel.
[2467.74 --> 2470.68]  So a copyright strike results in your channel
[2470.68 --> 2473.90]  actually getting features pulled from it
[2473.90 --> 2475.10]  and potentially removed
[2475.10 --> 2476.02]  if you get enough of them.
[2476.08 --> 2476.58]  Like live streaming.
[2476.70 --> 2478.38]  A content ID claim,
[2478.74 --> 2480.92]  what happens is you get a notification.
[2481.34 --> 2482.14]  You get an email
[2482.14 --> 2484.80]  that you've received a content ID claim,
[2485.30 --> 2486.72]  and then you get the timestamp,
[2486.80 --> 2487.16]  sometimes,
[2487.16 --> 2489.48]  you get the timestamps within the video
[2489.48 --> 2494.02]  that the content ID system
[2494.02 --> 2495.58]  has determined are a match
[2495.58 --> 2497.22]  for someone else's copyrighted works.
[2497.74 --> 2500.04]  Then you get a chance to file a dispute.
[2500.22 --> 2501.06]  And I actually didn't know
[2501.06 --> 2502.84]  this particular aspect of it
[2502.84 --> 2503.78]  until last week,
[2503.94 --> 2505.32]  but this is cool.
[2506.32 --> 2507.40]  In the event that,
[2507.44 --> 2507.78]  oh, right,
[2507.94 --> 2508.82]  and what happens is
[2508.82 --> 2510.10]  the video actually stays up.
[2510.30 --> 2511.24]  You keep all your views,
[2511.36 --> 2512.32]  you keep your like, dislikes,
[2512.42 --> 2513.08]  your subscribers,
[2513.32 --> 2513.90]  or whatever.
[2513.90 --> 2517.50]  But the monetization of that video
[2517.50 --> 2519.74]  goes to the original copyright holder.
[2520.32 --> 2521.72]  But this is something interesting.
[2522.16 --> 2523.68]  If you dispute that claim
[2523.68 --> 2525.34]  within a pretty short period of time,
[2525.54 --> 2527.48]  and I don't know if this is actually
[2527.48 --> 2528.82]  in YouTube's terms of service,
[2528.92 --> 2529.88]  so I don't want to like,
[2530.44 --> 2531.34]  someone told me.
[2531.60 --> 2532.94]  So I don't want to nail them down
[2532.94 --> 2534.20]  on exactly what that is.
[2534.24 --> 2535.28]  I don't know if they're going to change it
[2535.28 --> 2535.90]  or whatever else.
[2535.94 --> 2537.82]  But if you dispute it fairly promptly,
[2537.92 --> 2538.68]  and it doesn't have to be like
[2538.68 --> 2539.44]  within the first hour
[2539.44 --> 2540.24]  or anything like that,
[2540.44 --> 2541.40]  but pretty promptly,
[2541.40 --> 2543.64]  what happens is that
[2543.64 --> 2544.90]  not only does the video
[2544.90 --> 2545.68]  not go away,
[2546.18 --> 2548.06]  but you actually get
[2548.06 --> 2550.08]  to take that money back
[2550.08 --> 2550.98]  that was claimed
[2550.98 --> 2552.08]  by the copyright holder
[2552.08 --> 2552.82]  in the meantime.
[2553.12 --> 2554.32]  You don't actually lose
[2554.32 --> 2555.50]  any of your revenue.
[2555.94 --> 2557.30]  So content ID...
[2557.30 --> 2558.04]  You do have to be pretty quick
[2558.04 --> 2558.40]  on that one.
[2559.44 --> 2560.68]  It's like days.
[2561.14 --> 2561.38]  Yeah.
[2561.56 --> 2561.92]  But like,
[2561.98 --> 2562.60]  don't waste time,
[2562.76 --> 2563.26]  basically.
[2563.46 --> 2563.58]  Yeah.
[2564.38 --> 2566.02]  So content ID
[2566.02 --> 2566.92]  is actually
[2566.92 --> 2569.20]  a much more benign
[2569.20 --> 2571.02]  and less harmful way
[2571.02 --> 2571.94]  of dealing with this
[2571.94 --> 2572.76]  than I think
[2572.76 --> 2573.76]  a lot of people
[2573.76 --> 2576.96]  necessarily understand
[2576.96 --> 2577.94]  as evidenced
[2577.94 --> 2579.64]  by some of the reactions
[2579.64 --> 2581.36]  in the video here.
[2581.96 --> 2582.60]  Or excuse me,
[2582.66 --> 2583.72]  in the forum thread here.
[2583.90 --> 2585.30]  Because all you have to do
[2585.30 --> 2585.78]  is say,
[2585.96 --> 2586.66]  no, actually,
[2586.74 --> 2587.78]  I own the copyright to this.
[2587.82 --> 2588.76]  Or no,
[2588.82 --> 2589.66]  this is fair use.
[2590.44 --> 2590.88]  Again,
[2591.00 --> 2591.54]  knowing though
[2591.54 --> 2592.24]  that they could come back
[2592.24 --> 2592.50]  and say,
[2592.56 --> 2592.98]  actually,
[2593.08 --> 2593.70]  it's not fair use.
[2593.70 --> 2595.74]  And it's one clarification there
[2595.74 --> 2596.88]  is it's not YouTube
[2596.88 --> 2597.66]  coming back.
[2598.30 --> 2599.26]  It's them.
[2599.52 --> 2600.46]  The original copyright holder.
[2600.54 --> 2601.40]  The person who filed it originally.
[2601.86 --> 2602.50]  So if you're like,
[2602.96 --> 2603.42]  hey,
[2603.54 --> 2604.72]  this is actually fine,
[2604.84 --> 2605.40]  they could just be like,
[2605.50 --> 2605.66]  no.
[2606.90 --> 2608.14]  So there is that
[2608.14 --> 2609.58]  power imbalance there.
[2609.72 --> 2609.90]  Yes.
[2610.14 --> 2611.34]  But at the very least,
[2611.42 --> 2612.46]  they aren't striking you.
[2612.66 --> 2614.08]  And that's a really big difference
[2614.08 --> 2615.74]  because they're not damaging.
[2615.90 --> 2616.06]  Okay,
[2616.14 --> 2617.12]  you might lose the money
[2617.12 --> 2617.80]  that you might have made
[2617.80 --> 2618.38]  on that video.
[2618.94 --> 2620.38]  But what you don't lose
[2620.38 --> 2621.30]  is the ability
[2621.30 --> 2622.64]  to continue to run your channel.
[2623.20 --> 2623.36]  Yeah.
[2623.36 --> 2625.96]  So I think
[2625.96 --> 2626.66]  one of the reasons
[2626.66 --> 2627.62]  and the reason
[2627.62 --> 2628.70]  for the title of this stream,
[2628.78 --> 2629.76]  which actually ended up being
[2629.76 --> 2631.62]  almost entirely about this.
[2631.88 --> 2631.98]  Yeah.
[2632.54 --> 2633.58]  One of the reasons
[2633.58 --> 2634.52]  that this is coming up
[2634.52 --> 2635.30]  so much right now
[2635.30 --> 2636.18]  is that
[2636.18 --> 2637.58]  it is my belief
[2637.58 --> 2638.80]  and again,
[2638.88 --> 2639.60]  I can't say
[2639.60 --> 2640.80]  who or where
[2640.80 --> 2641.32]  I might have
[2641.32 --> 2642.68]  gotten this idea from
[2642.68 --> 2643.42]  because I don't know
[2643.42 --> 2646.04]  if that hypothetical person
[2646.04 --> 2647.20]  is allowed to
[2647.20 --> 2648.48]  hypothetically tell me
[2648.48 --> 2649.32]  what I'm hypothetically
[2649.32 --> 2650.12]  about to repeat.
[2650.94 --> 2651.14]  Okay.
[2651.42 --> 2652.86]  But it is my understanding
[2652.86 --> 2653.38]  that YouTube
[2653.38 --> 2654.08]  has recently
[2654.08 --> 2655.12]  made some changes
[2655.12 --> 2657.10]  to the Content ID system,
[2657.22 --> 2658.22]  making it more sensitive.
[2659.18 --> 2660.58]  This is purely speculation
[2660.58 --> 2661.34]  on my part.
[2661.46 --> 2662.26]  I have no evidence
[2662.26 --> 2662.86]  for this whatsoever,
[2662.96 --> 2663.74]  but I would guess
[2663.74 --> 2664.96]  that part of this
[2664.96 --> 2665.60]  is in preparation
[2665.60 --> 2666.58]  for the changes
[2666.58 --> 2667.34]  that are being made
[2667.34 --> 2668.78]  to the Article 13 thing
[2668.78 --> 2669.26]  that's happening
[2669.26 --> 2669.96]  over in Europe.
[2669.96 --> 2670.58]  Oh.
[2671.40 --> 2672.48]  So they are making
[2672.48 --> 2674.36]  Content ID more sensitive
[2674.36 --> 2675.52]  is my understanding
[2675.52 --> 2676.38]  of what's going on
[2676.38 --> 2677.26]  and this is
[2677.26 --> 2678.18]  the evidence
[2678.18 --> 2679.32]  that I have for that
[2679.32 --> 2680.16]  is that
[2680.16 --> 2681.88]  I am actually getting
[2681.88 --> 2684.60]  a ton of Content ID claims
[2684.60 --> 2685.50]  both ways.
[2685.66 --> 2686.54]  So I'm in sort of
[2686.54 --> 2687.70]  an unusual situation
[2687.70 --> 2689.36]  where I own
[2689.36 --> 2690.12]  two,
[2690.32 --> 2690.76]  well more,
[2690.94 --> 2692.10]  but two in particular,
[2692.62 --> 2693.64]  two YouTube channels
[2693.64 --> 2694.70]  that periodically
[2694.70 --> 2696.10]  borrow footage
[2696.10 --> 2696.94]  that was originally
[2696.94 --> 2698.14]  uploaded on the other.
[2698.40 --> 2699.78]  So I actually woke up
[2699.78 --> 2700.50]  the other day
[2700.50 --> 2708.60]  with the Tech Quickie inbox
[2708.60 --> 2711.34]  full of Content ID claims
[2711.34 --> 2712.94]  from Linus Media Group Incorporated
[2713.50 --> 2715.78]  on the Linus Tech Tips channel.
[2717.10 --> 2718.14]  No, son.
[2718.38 --> 2719.52]  Don't do that.
[2719.52 --> 2724.84]  That's actually hilarious.
[2725.22 --> 2726.12]  Oh my God.
[2726.32 --> 2727.60]  So anyway,
[2727.90 --> 2728.98]  back to the whole
[2728.98 --> 2730.04]  the Linux gamer thing.
[2730.66 --> 2731.64]  I didn't know
[2731.64 --> 2733.04]  about the Content ID claim.
[2733.32 --> 2734.22]  I wouldn't have given
[2734.22 --> 2735.02]  two hoots
[2735.02 --> 2736.56]  if the video did exist.
[2736.92 --> 2737.90]  I didn't even know
[2737.90 --> 2739.58]  about the video
[2739.58 --> 2740.58]  until I woke up
[2740.58 --> 2741.08]  this morning
[2741.08 --> 2743.00]  and the Content ID claim
[2743.00 --> 2744.24]  not only had already
[2744.24 --> 2744.74]  been issued
[2744.74 --> 2745.36]  but had already
[2745.36 --> 2746.36]  been retracted
[2746.36 --> 2748.64]  by the automated system.
[2749.52 --> 2751.98]  I don't remember
[2751.98 --> 2752.74]  where I was going with this.
[2752.90 --> 2753.28]  Basically,
[2753.54 --> 2754.42]  I gave no cares,
[2754.60 --> 2755.50]  didn't even know about it
[2755.50 --> 2756.50]  and it was already resolved
[2756.50 --> 2757.80]  before I was even aware
[2757.80 --> 2759.98]  that there was an issue.
[2760.84 --> 2762.04]  So sorry,
[2762.20 --> 2764.12]  tinfoil hat folks out there.
[2765.54 --> 2766.24]  Linus Media Group
[2766.24 --> 2767.30]  is not in the business
[2767.30 --> 2769.00]  of running around
[2769.00 --> 2772.34]  and issuing DMCA takedowns
[2772.34 --> 2773.96]  to people who criticize our work
[2773.96 --> 2775.56]  or create memes
[2775.56 --> 2776.76]  based on our content
[2776.76 --> 2778.76]  or otherwise transform
[2778.76 --> 2779.56]  what we do.
[2780.22 --> 2782.38]  We believe very,
[2782.68 --> 2784.00]  very strongly
[2784.00 --> 2785.52]  in the power of community.
[2786.12 --> 2787.58]  We have turned criticism
[2787.58 --> 2788.96]  of our content
[2788.96 --> 2790.28]  into new content
[2790.28 --> 2791.26]  like what we did
[2791.26 --> 2792.08]  with Louis Rossman
[2792.08 --> 2793.32]  and his reaction video
[2793.32 --> 2796.02]  to our video card baking piece.
[2796.14 --> 2797.12]  One of my favorite videos
[2797.12 --> 2798.14]  on the internet
[2798.14 --> 2800.42]  is a guy named Nitro Blast.
[2800.48 --> 2801.26]  You can find it on YouTube.
[2801.72 --> 2802.64]  Took a video of me...
[2802.64 --> 2803.10]  Nice douche.
[2803.52 --> 2804.22]  Just kidding.
[2804.22 --> 2805.36]  Took a video of me
[2805.36 --> 2807.22]  whipping a pair of headphones around
[2807.22 --> 2807.76]  and smacking them
[2807.76 --> 2808.16]  into the ground
[2808.16 --> 2809.16]  and then stomping on them
[2809.16 --> 2810.00]  and then throwing them
[2810.00 --> 2810.58]  against the wall.
[2810.78 --> 2811.64]  I don't know if you remember that.
[2811.78 --> 2811.90]  I don't remember that.
[2811.90 --> 2812.74]  But it was for these
[2812.74 --> 2814.66]  like active wear earbud review
[2814.66 --> 2815.96]  that I did back in like 2013.
[2816.20 --> 2816.48]  Sure.
[2816.68 --> 2818.26]  And he put the stomping
[2818.26 --> 2818.92]  and the throwing
[2818.92 --> 2820.06]  against the garage door
[2820.06 --> 2824.82]  to the Wii U...
[2824.82 --> 2826.38]  the original Wii soundtrack.
[2826.70 --> 2827.38]  It's hilarious.
[2828.88 --> 2830.44]  Just go to his channel, probably.
[2834.22 --> 2836.94]  This seems like more work
[2836.94 --> 2837.88]  than it's probably worth.
[2838.08 --> 2838.78]  There's like a hundred.
[2839.02 --> 2839.40]  Oh, no.
[2839.74 --> 2840.52]  A hundred subscribers.
[2840.52 --> 2841.28]  That's it right there.
[2841.36 --> 2841.76]  This is it.
[2841.82 --> 2842.60]  Luke Sports Tips.
[2842.68 --> 2843.26]  All right, here we go.
[2843.32 --> 2844.14]  It's hilarious.
[2844.48 --> 2844.76]  Nitro Blast.
[2844.76 --> 2845.84]  I love this video.
[2846.12 --> 2847.16]  You DMC-ass.
[2847.30 --> 2848.12]  You're done, son.
[2848.38 --> 2848.94]  All right?
[2849.24 --> 2850.60]  We're playing this video
[2850.60 --> 2852.00]  and you'll like it.
[2854.58 --> 2855.90]  So the headphones fall out.
[2856.08 --> 2857.50]  It's the spring clip review.
[2857.50 --> 2861.80]  So each one,
[2861.90 --> 2863.30]  like the throw and the stomp,
[2863.42 --> 2863.86]  which is behind
[2863.86 --> 2864.92]  your freaking notification,
[2865.28 --> 2866.82]  both have a sound effect.
[2868.68 --> 2869.86]  It's so funny.
[2870.98 --> 2871.94]  I love this thing.
[2872.10 --> 2873.18]  It's probably more funny to me
[2873.18 --> 2874.20]  because it's me.
[2874.54 --> 2875.88]  Also, we don't have sound right now.
[2876.02 --> 2877.06]  But I think it's hilarious.
[2877.50 --> 2879.52]  And then at the beginning of this show,
[2879.58 --> 2880.62]  I talked about some guy
[2880.62 --> 2881.68]  who made a song.
[2881.92 --> 2882.16]  Yeah.
[2882.22 --> 2882.92]  And in the song,
[2882.98 --> 2883.68]  he used our voices
[2883.68 --> 2884.54]  and I think it's great.
[2884.78 --> 2885.52]  We're not going to go after
[2885.52 --> 2886.38]  any of that kind of stuff.
[2886.38 --> 2887.56]  Using our content
[2887.56 --> 2888.94]  in tasteful ways is cool.
[2889.26 --> 2889.44]  Yep.
[2889.68 --> 2891.00]  And even in not tasteful ways,
[2891.08 --> 2891.86]  as long as you're well
[2891.86 --> 2893.06]  within your fair use, right?
[2893.06 --> 2893.46]  By taste,
[2893.56 --> 2895.08]  I meant ripping it off completely
[2895.08 --> 2896.38]  and just posting it raw.
[2896.56 --> 2896.88]  Yes.
[2899.88 --> 2901.78]  We should really do our sponsor.
[2901.78 --> 2903.78]  Oh, it was muted for them too.
[2904.72 --> 2905.66]  Oh, was it like,
[2905.94 --> 2907.36]  is YouTube actually muted?
[2908.02 --> 2909.00]  Oh, I don't know.
[2909.16 --> 2909.66]  Sorry, guys.
[2909.70 --> 2910.18]  There's nothing,
[2910.52 --> 2912.10]  nothing I can do about that right now.
[2912.22 --> 2913.52]  We really need to do our sponsor.
[2913.70 --> 2914.10]  Squarespace!

[2968.36 --> 2969.42]  And whatever,
[2969.54 --> 2969.92]  it's awesome.
[2970.04 --> 2970.82]  It's inexpensive.

[2976.86 --> 2977.80]  Also, maybe even if you do,
[2977.88 --> 2978.98]  you can get rid of your other VPN
[2978.98 --> 2980.12]  and use PIA instead.
[2982.30 --> 2983.10]  Sorry about that.
[2983.48 --> 2984.72]  That was a little
[2984.72 --> 2985.86]  on the nose.
[2985.96 --> 2986.80]  Look, everyone was having
[2986.80 --> 2987.22]  a good time
[2987.22 --> 2987.48]  and no,
[2987.54 --> 2988.26]  that's not a nose.
[2988.26 --> 2992.90]  Oh my goodness.
[2993.14 --> 2993.76]  It's, yeah,
[2993.88 --> 2995.00]  so just so people know,
[2995.10 --> 2995.90]  a lot of the kickback
[2995.90 --> 2996.42]  that happens
[2996.42 --> 2998.70]  will be offer codes.
[2998.82 --> 2999.68]  So Honey will have
[2999.68 --> 3001.02]  Honey-specific offer codes.
[3001.16 --> 3001.56]  Oh, that's cool.
[3001.78 --> 3001.98]  Yeah.
[3002.44 --> 3003.52]  That's commonly
[3003.52 --> 3004.66]  how I believe it's done.
[3005.44 --> 3007.32]  You have flow plane news!
[3007.84 --> 3008.12]  I do.
[3008.12 --> 3008.52]  Which is fine
[3008.52 --> 3009.42]  because we're basically
[3009.42 --> 3010.62]  like done the show
[3010.62 --> 3011.18]  at this point.
[3011.36 --> 3011.54]  Yeah.
[3011.64 --> 3013.86]  So let's talk about it.
[3013.98 --> 3014.98]  I want to talk about it.
[3015.14 --> 3015.58]  Do you want to?
[3015.58 --> 3016.24]  I want to talk about it.
[3016.26 --> 3017.02]  Do you want to do it?
[3017.08 --> 3017.68]  I want to talk about it.
[3017.68 --> 3018.42]  You can cruise around
[3018.42 --> 3019.06]  and ask questions
[3019.06 --> 3019.80]  and I can talk about it?
[3019.80 --> 3020.08]  Yeah, yeah.
[3020.14 --> 3020.74]  I'm going to do it.
[3020.76 --> 3021.12]  I'm going to do it.
[3021.12 --> 3021.80]  I'm doing it.
[3021.84 --> 3023.04]  But I don't want you to do it.
[3023.04 --> 3023.06]  Don't worry.
[3023.16 --> 3024.28]  I'm not going to show it.
[3024.32 --> 3024.98]  I'm not going to show it.
[3025.06 --> 3025.40]  Yeah, yeah.
[3025.60 --> 3025.84]  Okay.
[3025.90 --> 3027.68]  I'm just going to sign in as
[3027.68 --> 3029.40]  whatever one of those.
[3029.40 --> 3029.50]  Oh, man.
[3029.50 --> 3030.76]  We were having a long conversation
[3030.76 --> 3031.82]  because guys,
[3031.90 --> 3033.90]  we are feeling pretty good
[3033.90 --> 3035.72]  about low float plane right now.
[3035.82 --> 3035.94]  Yeah.
[3036.36 --> 3037.52]  Everyone in the float plane chat
[3037.52 --> 3039.66]  is spamming their early adopter emojis.
[3040.58 --> 3040.98]  Nice.
[3040.98 --> 3043.02]  10 million pew pew planes in chat.
[3043.02 --> 3046.18]  Oh, my God.
[3046.38 --> 3047.48]  There's also no rate limiting
[3047.48 --> 3047.92]  on the chat.
[3047.98 --> 3048.82]  So let's go fast.
[3049.68 --> 3051.12]  Yeah, we'll get that addressed.
[3051.14 --> 3052.26]  That'll happen at some point.
[3052.36 --> 3053.58]  We'll get in touch with Knight.
[3053.82 --> 3054.14]  Okay?
[3054.28 --> 3055.76]  We'll get some Knight Bot support
[3055.76 --> 3056.40]  going on here.
[3056.40 --> 3056.74]  Oh, geez.
[3057.04 --> 3057.96]  It's going to take some time, though.
[3058.06 --> 3058.72]  It's going to take some time.
[3060.30 --> 3060.88]  Oh, shoot.
[3061.06 --> 3061.72]  Did this not work?
[3061.86 --> 3062.46]  What's going on here?
[3063.60 --> 3064.14]  I thought I'd...
[3064.14 --> 3065.50]  The emoji's called pew pew.
[3065.84 --> 3066.14]  So...
[3067.26 --> 3068.00]  Are you on the...
[3068.00 --> 3068.84]  No, you're on the wrong thing.
[3069.20 --> 3069.78]  Oh, right.
[3069.90 --> 3070.02]  Sorry.
[3070.06 --> 3070.64]  I'm on the wrong thing.
[3070.74 --> 3071.10]  It's all good.
[3073.70 --> 3074.38]  Oh, man.
[3074.68 --> 3074.98]  Whoa.
[3075.26 --> 3075.64]  All right.
[3075.74 --> 3077.14]  I told chat there's no rate limiting
[3077.14 --> 3078.58]  and then they took that to heart
[3078.58 --> 3079.08]  a little bit.
[3079.24 --> 3079.74]  Yeah, guys.
[3079.82 --> 3080.10]  Come on.
[3080.12 --> 3080.30]  Chill.
[3080.48 --> 3080.68]  Chill.
[3081.04 --> 3081.38]  Chill.
[3081.48 --> 3083.04]  We're trying to have a stream here, okay?
[3083.62 --> 3083.96]  What?
[3084.10 --> 3085.00]  Nick, what can I do for you?
[3085.28 --> 3085.72]  Nothing.
[3085.94 --> 3086.18]  Nothing?
[3086.30 --> 3086.78]  Okay, cool.
[3087.14 --> 3087.72]  How's it going, mate?
[3088.18 --> 3089.86]  Can we copystrike Linux gamer?
[3092.44 --> 3092.84]  No.
[3092.84 --> 3096.50]  Good money.
[3096.66 --> 3097.70]  Good money.
[3097.84 --> 3099.44]  Do we have any cool merch updates or anything?
[3101.26 --> 3101.82]  Next week.
[3101.86 --> 3102.04]  Oh.
[3102.38 --> 3103.28]  LTX update.
[3103.84 --> 3105.08]  Oh, LTX updates.
[3105.22 --> 3106.30]  Merch update next week.
[3106.38 --> 3106.56]  Woo!
[3107.22 --> 3108.00]  Holy crap.
[3108.22 --> 3108.98]  Do we have an update?
[3109.12 --> 3109.70]  Did they do one?
[3110.40 --> 3110.80]  No.
[3110.92 --> 3112.70]  There's no LTX update this week.
[3112.94 --> 3113.26]  Wow.
[3113.40 --> 3115.28]  But I have an update for LTX.
[3115.86 --> 3118.38]  So my update is that we are going to be filming
[3118.38 --> 3120.54]  the LTX announcement video
[3120.54 --> 3121.88]  that's going to go on the LTT channel.
[3121.88 --> 3122.94]  We're going to film it next week.
[3123.66 --> 3124.74]  That'll be coming soon,
[3124.84 --> 3126.46]  and it will include details
[3126.46 --> 3128.84]  like when you can buy tickets.
[3129.02 --> 3130.98]  It's coming pretty quick, fast,
[3131.10 --> 3132.56]  and I'm very, very excited.
[3133.02 --> 3133.90]  This is not working.
[3133.98 --> 3134.80]  Do you know why this isn't working?
[3136.72 --> 3137.96]  It worked on mine.
[3138.30 --> 3138.62]  It's just...
[3138.62 --> 3139.70]  Oh, it's working now.
[3139.70 --> 3140.76]  ...going really slow
[3140.76 --> 3142.32]  because this isn't on our, like,
[3142.40 --> 3144.62]  actual good stuff, basically.
[3145.12 --> 3145.50]  Okay.
[3145.60 --> 3147.20]  So this is, like, our Pinner server.
[3147.50 --> 3147.68]  Yeah.
[3147.86 --> 3149.48]  You don't want to show the front?
[3150.56 --> 3150.96]  Um...
[3150.96 --> 3152.04]  I could...
[3152.04 --> 3152.38]  You know what?
[3152.40 --> 3152.52]  Yeah.
[3152.56 --> 3154.00]  As long as I don't show this password,
[3154.10 --> 3154.76]  then I'm good, right?
[3155.74 --> 3156.14]  Yeah.
[3156.22 --> 3158.12]  So I could show me copy-pasting this password.
[3158.18 --> 3159.60]  Well, just show the front
[3159.60 --> 3160.50]  and look around,
[3160.50 --> 3161.58]  and then...
[3161.58 --> 3162.12]  This is the front?
[3162.82 --> 3163.68]  No, this is.
[3164.62 --> 3165.98]  Oh, is that before I sign in?
[3165.98 --> 3166.56]  How do you get to that?
[3166.64 --> 3167.80]  Oh, it's before the login page.
[3168.02 --> 3168.20]  Yeah.
[3168.26 --> 3169.36]  Okay, so just take this away.
[3169.86 --> 3170.66]  Okay, so guys,
[3170.82 --> 3172.26]  don't judge the responsiveness
[3172.26 --> 3173.24]  of the site right now.
[3173.32 --> 3174.52]  This is running on, like,
[3175.18 --> 3175.90]  some pretty...
[3175.90 --> 3176.36]  It's on its own.
[3176.40 --> 3176.80]  It's on...
[3176.80 --> 3177.72]  It's on a...
[3177.72 --> 3179.18]  Garbage town stuff.
[3179.36 --> 3180.16]  Like, don't worry about it.
[3180.28 --> 3181.48]  It is before the production.
[3181.62 --> 3181.94]  Okay.
[3182.18 --> 3183.34]  So there's sign in.
[3183.42 --> 3184.00]  There's join.
[3184.28 --> 3184.50]  Scroll.
[3184.82 --> 3185.02]  Scroll.
[3185.14 --> 3185.46]  You're not...
[3185.46 --> 3186.10]  No, I'm going to scroll.
[3186.20 --> 3186.46]  I'm just...
[3186.46 --> 3188.48]  You're not even at the top of the page.
[3188.76 --> 3189.58]  They can't see the...
[3189.58 --> 3189.90]  There.
[3190.30 --> 3190.68]  There you go.
[3190.72 --> 3191.06]  Oh, okay.
[3191.14 --> 3191.32]  Sorry.
[3191.62 --> 3191.88]  All right.
[3191.94 --> 3192.92]  Say hello to float plane.
[3193.38 --> 3194.20]  Learn more or join.
[3194.20 --> 3195.20]  So learn more right now.
[3195.24 --> 3196.06]  Yeah, it doesn't do anything.
[3196.20 --> 3196.40]  Yeah.
[3196.56 --> 3197.78]  It will scroll you down.
[3197.96 --> 3198.10]  Yeah.
[3198.58 --> 3200.90]  This search actually works,
[3201.02 --> 3202.22]  but it's a search for channels,
[3202.66 --> 3205.68]  and there's no channels in this environment,
[3205.90 --> 3207.22]  so it's not going to find anything.
[3207.22 --> 3207.48]  It doesn't do anything.
[3207.86 --> 3210.16]  Also, this is supposed to be, like...
[3210.16 --> 3210.84]  You explain.
[3210.90 --> 3211.20]  You explain.
[3211.28 --> 3211.54]  You go.
[3211.58 --> 3211.84]  You go.
[3211.84 --> 3212.56]  Right here, there's, like,
[3212.56 --> 3213.74]  a spindle of tiles
[3213.74 --> 3215.82]  that show what creators are on the site,
[3216.24 --> 3219.96]  but as there aren't any on this,
[3220.18 --> 3221.38]  like, pre-production version,
[3221.54 --> 3222.28]  it's just empty.
[3222.66 --> 3222.88]  Yeah.
[3222.88 --> 3223.42]  So there's tiles.
[3223.42 --> 3224.14]  There will be a thing,
[3224.46 --> 3225.14]  and then down here,
[3225.22 --> 3226.32]  there's just some stuff.
[3226.50 --> 3228.12]  Yeah, just explaining why we exist.
[3228.18 --> 3228.74]  These pictures,
[3229.22 --> 3230.30]  the bottom one
[3230.30 --> 3231.56]  and the top one of those three
[3231.56 --> 3233.06]  are just photos that Brandon took,
[3233.56 --> 3234.58]  and then the middle one
[3234.58 --> 3235.78]  is a photo of Brandon.
[3236.56 --> 3237.22]  Hey, it's Brandon!
[3238.84 --> 3239.28]  Nice!
[3241.96 --> 3242.44]  Yeah.
[3243.58 --> 3244.30]  It's just...
[3244.30 --> 3245.58]  It's just stylish.
[3245.80 --> 3246.26]  Oh, okay.
[3246.38 --> 3246.68]  Got it.
[3246.68 --> 3246.92]  Got it.
[3246.92 --> 3247.10]  Cool.
[3247.30 --> 3247.48]  Okay.
[3248.68 --> 3249.22]  All right.
[3249.52 --> 3250.22]  So now we can...
[3250.22 --> 3251.14]  Then unshare...
[3251.14 --> 3252.38]  Can you actually read the legal stuff?
[3252.38 --> 3253.50]  Is that a real link?
[3253.90 --> 3254.40]  It is.
[3255.04 --> 3255.54]  Hey!
[3255.80 --> 3257.38]  We have terms of service and stuff now.
[3257.42 --> 3257.92]  That's awesome.
[3258.76 --> 3259.20]  Yeah.
[3259.32 --> 3259.90]  Look at that.
[3259.96 --> 3261.28]  It's been on the site the whole time.
[3261.44 --> 3261.94]  It's just...
[3261.94 --> 3262.94]  It wasn't as easy to find.
[3263.20 --> 3264.62]  You should probably unshare now.
[3265.14 --> 3265.58]  Right.
[3265.76 --> 3265.90]  Yeah.
[3266.02 --> 3266.56]  I'll unshare.
[3266.64 --> 3267.04]  Give me a sec.
[3267.04 --> 3268.04]  Okay.
[3269.66 --> 3270.10]  Okay.
[3274.42 --> 3275.28]  And we're back.
[3276.34 --> 3276.48]  Oh.
[3277.12 --> 3277.94]  Go away.
[3278.06 --> 3279.24]  No, I don't want to save a password.
[3279.36 --> 3280.26]  I love how when you press never,
[3280.40 --> 3281.08]  it still prompts you
[3281.08 --> 3282.40]  the next time you do a thing.
[3283.14 --> 3283.54]  Okay.
[3284.04 --> 3285.58]  So, if I go to...
[3286.58 --> 3287.52]  Here we go.
[3288.58 --> 3289.74]  My home...
[3289.74 --> 3290.14]  Hold on a second.
[3290.22 --> 3290.76]  Browse Creators.
[3291.62 --> 3291.86]  Wait.
[3292.16 --> 3292.80]  Where do I go?
[3292.92 --> 3293.66]  What are you doing?
[3293.66 --> 3294.62]  I want to browse Creators.
[3294.68 --> 3295.68]  I want to go to Channel Super Fun.
[3296.58 --> 3296.86]  Okay.
[3297.64 --> 3298.04]  Yay!
[3298.96 --> 3300.22]  Actually, this one isn't as set up
[3300.22 --> 3300.86]  as some of the other ones.
[3300.92 --> 3301.82]  Because there are a lot...
[3301.82 --> 3302.60]  You're also not...
[3302.60 --> 3304.00]  Well, you're not subscribed to that one.
[3304.16 --> 3304.44]  Right?
[3304.80 --> 3306.28]  You signed into TechWiki,
[3306.40 --> 3307.78]  so you're probably only subscribed to TechWiki.
[3307.90 --> 3309.00]  So, the other ones were locked
[3309.00 --> 3310.42]  because you don't have information to see it.
[3310.44 --> 3310.60]  Cool.
[3311.24 --> 3312.34]  So, here's my home.
[3313.60 --> 3314.64]  Here's some videos.
[3314.98 --> 3315.66]  So, basically,
[3315.84 --> 3317.02]  the main new thing
[3317.02 --> 3319.04]  that happened on these pages
[3319.04 --> 3320.48]  and this TechWiki page
[3320.48 --> 3322.48]  doesn't have a banner at the top.
[3322.56 --> 3323.26]  There's a better one.
[3323.26 --> 3323.94]  Hold on a second.
[3324.04 --> 3325.30]  Because you logged into a different account.
[3325.40 --> 3325.78]  Did you log into TechWiki?
[3325.78 --> 3326.00]  No, no.
[3326.00 --> 3326.68]  This one's fine.
[3327.20 --> 3327.42]  Okay.
[3327.54 --> 3328.40]  Yeah, it just shows locks.
[3328.50 --> 3328.74]  Yeah, it just shows locks.
[3328.74 --> 3329.44]  So, you don't have permission
[3329.44 --> 3330.26]  to see that content.
[3330.42 --> 3330.86]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3331.50 --> 3332.72]  The main thing that we changed
[3332.72 --> 3334.46]  is we added a support column
[3334.46 --> 3335.38]  to the far right-hand side
[3335.38 --> 3336.30]  so Creators are going to be able
[3336.30 --> 3338.32]  to start setting up multiple plans
[3338.32 --> 3340.42]  if they would so choose.
[3340.52 --> 3341.14]  They don't have to.
[3341.28 --> 3341.42]  Yep.
[3342.44 --> 3345.78]  And something we're working on...
[3345.78 --> 3346.98]  This is a placeholder, I guess, eh?
[3347.22 --> 3347.66]  Yeah.
[3347.66 --> 3353.28]  This is not the production environment.
[3355.80 --> 3356.74]  Put that there.
[3359.32 --> 3359.72]  Guess.
[3360.40 --> 3360.76]  AJ.
[3361.50 --> 3362.02]  I just...
[3362.02 --> 3362.88]  I don't actually even know.
[3363.02 --> 3364.28]  I just wanted to see what you'd say.
[3364.28 --> 3366.04]  It could be any one of them.
[3366.04 --> 3366.84]  Yeah, it really could.
[3367.22 --> 3367.54]  All right.
[3367.54 --> 3368.38]  I think I know who it was,
[3368.38 --> 3372.50]  but basically, one other thing...
[3372.50 --> 3373.54]  I don't know why I said basically.
[3373.80 --> 3375.28]  Another thing that we're working on,
[3375.28 --> 3377.32]  as you can see, there's a TechCookie account.
[3377.68 --> 3377.92]  Yes.
[3378.08 --> 3379.62]  I don't know when this is going to be done.
[3379.68 --> 3380.94]  I don't know how feasible this is going to be,
[3381.18 --> 3382.74]  but we want you guys to be able
[3382.74 --> 3384.44]  to split your accounts up.
[3384.90 --> 3385.16]  Cool.
[3385.42 --> 3386.88]  And then there would be...
[3386.88 --> 3388.14]  Now that we have multiple tiers,
[3388.38 --> 3389.92]  you'd be able to subscribe to the tier
[3389.92 --> 3392.56]  that has all of the basic access
[3392.56 --> 3393.96]  to all of the different accounts.
[3394.04 --> 3394.22]  Sure.
[3394.42 --> 3395.74]  Can I poke around in the CMS too?
[3396.18 --> 3396.56]  Yeah.
[3396.96 --> 3398.54]  So uploading videos,
[3398.62 --> 3401.28]  like, works pretty low well these days.
[3401.36 --> 3402.16]  Do I have any videos in here?
[3402.26 --> 3403.74]  No, this is a demo laptop.
[3403.74 --> 3403.96]  Yeah.
[3403.96 --> 3405.44]  Video library.
[3405.86 --> 3407.30]  One cool thing is you can go into edit,
[3407.50 --> 3409.12]  and now you can select what tier.
[3409.22 --> 3410.42]  So this one only has one tier.
[3410.64 --> 3410.96]  Cool.
[3411.02 --> 3411.98]  But you can select what tiers
[3411.98 --> 3413.26]  are able to see the thing.
[3413.48 --> 3414.80]  You've got your live settings.
[3414.94 --> 3415.72]  Yeah, I want to leave.
[3416.16 --> 3418.30]  Don't go to the other button in there.
[3418.34 --> 3418.98]  Don't go to settings?
[3419.58 --> 3420.78]  Oh, I'm not going to streaming keys.
[3420.88 --> 3421.12]  Don't worry.
[3421.18 --> 3421.46]  Don't worry.
[3421.88 --> 3422.74]  You've got your settings
[3422.74 --> 3424.78]  where you can make your...
[3424.78 --> 3425.20]  Wow.
[3426.46 --> 3428.32]  010110010.
[3429.02 --> 3429.76]  We're robots.
[3429.90 --> 3430.80]  Lorem Ipsum, whatever.
[3430.80 --> 3431.52]  Perfect.
[3431.72 --> 3432.04]  Thank you.
[3432.04 --> 3434.86]  Show monthly income.
[3434.98 --> 3436.20]  You can turn that on or off.
[3436.26 --> 3436.94]  That's pretty cool.
[3437.06 --> 3437.36]  So, yeah.
[3437.52 --> 3440.66]  So just above where the support button is,
[3440.78 --> 3442.10]  it shows, like,
[3442.14 --> 3443.88]  you can have how many subscribers you have
[3443.88 --> 3444.56]  and how much you make.
[3444.94 --> 3447.30]  But Flowplane isn't really designed
[3447.30 --> 3448.80]  around being a donations platform.
[3448.80 --> 3451.42]  it's more of a subscription to a service.
[3451.74 --> 3454.56]  So it doesn't fully fall in line with that.
[3454.62 --> 3456.20]  So if you want to set up your account that way,
[3456.26 --> 3456.74]  you can.
[3456.98 --> 3458.50]  But by default, we have it off.
[3460.20 --> 3460.68]  Price.
[3460.86 --> 3461.70]  $2,000.
[3462.38 --> 3462.76]  Nice.
[3462.82 --> 3463.68]  You get nothing.
[3463.98 --> 3464.36]  Nice.
[3464.42 --> 3464.86]  There we go.
[3464.96 --> 3465.18]  All right.
[3465.18 --> 3465.80]  This is the best tier.
[3465.80 --> 3467.30]  This is going to be the starred tier.
[3467.44 --> 3467.84]  Awesome.
[3467.84 --> 3469.76]  The get-wrecked tier.
[3470.56 --> 3471.52]  Now this...
[3471.52 --> 3472.22]  The tiers tier.
[3473.84 --> 3474.66]  I like it.
[3474.92 --> 3476.94]  Now this plan will not be seen publicly
[3476.94 --> 3478.32]  because it's not published yet.
[3478.36 --> 3478.68]  Okay.
[3478.80 --> 3480.18]  Because we want people to be very careful.
[3480.68 --> 3482.10]  Publishing a plan is permanent.
[3482.38 --> 3482.54]  Yeah.
[3482.60 --> 3483.56]  You will have to contact
[3483.56 --> 3484.44]  floatplane administrators
[3484.44 --> 3485.52]  to make certain changes.
[3485.78 --> 3485.92]  Okay.
[3485.92 --> 3487.32]  And that's because they would be...
[3487.32 --> 3487.92]  I published it.
[3487.92 --> 3488.16]  You're done.
[3488.16 --> 3488.52]  If they...
[3488.52 --> 3489.02]  Well, that's fine.
[3489.02 --> 3490.18]  I'm contacting the float...
[3490.18 --> 3491.42]  Can I make some changes, please, sir?
[3493.12 --> 3493.72]  Damn it!
[3493.72 --> 3496.02]  And the reason for that
[3496.02 --> 3496.86]  is to try to protect
[3496.86 --> 3498.04]  the people subscribing
[3498.04 --> 3498.84]  to the creator
[3498.84 --> 3500.02]  so the creator understands
[3500.02 --> 3500.58]  the implications
[3500.58 --> 3501.98]  of just ripping a plan
[3501.98 --> 3503.08]  out of people
[3503.08 --> 3504.16]  who are currently paying
[3504.16 --> 3504.56]  for something.
[3504.68 --> 3506.30]  So if we go out
[3506.30 --> 3507.50]  of the creator CMS,
[3507.74 --> 3509.36]  we go to the TechWiki channel...
[3510.56 --> 3511.44]  Oh, there you go.
[3511.48 --> 3513.04]  Then we have the get-wrecked tier!
[3513.22 --> 3513.46]  Yeah!
[3513.98 --> 3514.90]  And I believe
[3514.90 --> 3517.86]  that all I have to do
[3517.86 --> 3519.56]  is I can, like,
[3519.74 --> 3520.40]  add a card
[3520.40 --> 3521.60]  and, like, this stuff
[3521.60 --> 3522.40]  actually...
[3522.40 --> 3524.44]  I think the question
[3524.44 --> 3525.68]  burning in everyone's minds
[3525.68 --> 3526.22]  now, then,
[3526.70 --> 3529.10]  is when do we go into beta?
[3529.82 --> 3531.30]  I need this stuff in.
[3531.62 --> 3532.60]  I need the new
[3532.60 --> 3533.96]  upload and transcode systems.
[3534.20 --> 3535.46]  I need the support page.
[3535.70 --> 3537.02]  I need the FAQ page.
[3538.36 --> 3539.24]  Streaming's gonna get
[3539.24 --> 3539.92]  a little bit better.
[3540.72 --> 3542.00]  We're working on this
[3542.00 --> 3543.32]  multi-CDN thing
[3543.32 --> 3544.00]  that's going on.
[3544.10 --> 3544.78]  It's coming.
[3544.92 --> 3545.72]  We'll be there soon.
[3546.08 --> 3547.70]  The main benchmark for me
[3547.70 --> 3548.20]  for beta
[3548.20 --> 3550.78]  is that a few major pain points
[3550.78 --> 3551.48]  need to be solved.
[3551.48 --> 3552.54]  Every video
[3552.54 --> 3554.74]  can't have this new bubble on it.
[3554.88 --> 3555.70]  The search thing
[3555.70 --> 3557.24]  should probably work.
[3557.96 --> 3559.66]  Like, extremely basic functionality
[3559.66 --> 3560.50]  needs to be in place
[3560.50 --> 3561.38]  and we still have
[3561.38 --> 3562.10]  a bit of that.
[3562.18 --> 3562.60]  I didn't even know
[3562.60 --> 3563.60]  there was a search bar here.
[3564.14 --> 3564.88]  Oh, yeah, there isn't.
[3564.88 --> 3566.18]  Yeah, it doesn't do anything!
[3566.94 --> 3567.88]  Yeah, got it.
[3568.12 --> 3568.92]  It's actually been there,
[3569.04 --> 3569.86]  like, the whole time.
[3569.98 --> 3570.34]  Got it.
[3570.40 --> 3571.00]  Never noticed.
[3571.10 --> 3571.32]  Yeah.
[3571.32 --> 3571.88]  Never noticed.
[3571.88 --> 3572.22]  Yeah.
[3572.22 --> 3572.48]  Yeah.
[3572.82 --> 3573.10]  Yeah.
[3573.16 --> 3573.34]  Yeah.
[3573.34 --> 3576.10]  Yeah, so we're actually
[3576.10 --> 3577.58]  getting pretty close.
[3577.68 --> 3578.94]  And I think the new
[3578.94 --> 3579.92]  multi-column layout
[3579.92 --> 3580.96]  and the front page
[3580.96 --> 3582.30]  should add a little bit
[3582.30 --> 3584.64]  of good feeling
[3584.64 --> 3585.12]  to the site
[3585.12 --> 3586.20]  not being quite as alpha
[3586.20 --> 3586.70]  as it was.
[3586.70 --> 3588.26]  Yeah, it's pretty helpful right now.
[3588.26 --> 3589.56]  And we have some more
[3589.56 --> 3591.08]  of those types of things,
[3591.24 --> 3592.48]  some more on the creator side,
[3592.56 --> 3593.02]  like the upload
[3593.02 --> 3593.88]  and transcode stuff,
[3593.96 --> 3594.92]  which is going to be awesome.
[3595.92 --> 3597.18]  Like, here, real talk.
[3597.26 --> 3597.86]  Let's be honest.
[3599.92 --> 3601.56]  The way our transcode
[3601.56 --> 3603.42]  works right now
[3603.42 --> 3605.14]  is if TechDeals
[3605.14 --> 3606.54]  uploads one of his
[3606.54 --> 3608.38]  epic four-hour
[3608.38 --> 3609.56]  4K
[3609.56 --> 3611.90]  World of Warships streams
[3611.90 --> 3613.44]  to Floatplane.
[3614.04 --> 3615.54]  It's like 75 gigs.
[3615.72 --> 3616.72]  Linus Tech Tips
[3616.72 --> 3617.74]  has to wait
[3617.74 --> 3619.20]  like three hours
[3619.20 --> 3620.48]  to transcode a beat.
[3620.58 --> 3621.46]  Sometimes more.
[3622.60 --> 3623.58]  Because everything
[3623.58 --> 3624.56]  is done in series.
[3625.32 --> 3627.70]  So that won't happen anymore.
[3627.90 --> 3629.10]  So, like, there's reasons
[3629.10 --> 3630.42]  that we haven't
[3630.42 --> 3631.58]  just brought on
[3631.58 --> 3632.24]  a bunch of creators.
[3632.44 --> 3633.30]  Because there's honestly
[3633.30 --> 3634.58]  stuff that's really ready
[3634.58 --> 3635.82]  and then there's stuff
[3635.82 --> 3637.80]  that's not as ready.
[3637.92 --> 3638.86]  It's one thing
[3638.86 --> 3640.22]  to have
[3640.22 --> 3642.00]  a video playback site.
[3642.44 --> 3642.58]  Yeah.
[3642.62 --> 3643.00]  Honestly,
[3643.64 --> 3644.64]  Luke could have set that up
[3644.64 --> 3645.50]  in 48 hours.
[3645.86 --> 3646.34]  In fact,
[3646.56 --> 3647.28]  three years ago,
[3647.28 --> 3648.08]  he did.
[3648.24 --> 3648.48]  Yay!
[3649.24 --> 3650.26]  It just sucked.
[3650.64 --> 3651.28]  Thanks, man.
[3651.74 --> 3652.82]  The hard thing
[3652.82 --> 3654.10]  is scaling.
[3654.42 --> 3655.70]  And the really cool thing
[3655.70 --> 3656.10]  about this, though...
[3656.10 --> 3656.98]  If you want to play a video
[3656.98 --> 3657.78]  to one person,
[3658.24 --> 3658.82]  pretty easy.
[3658.96 --> 3659.16]  Yeah.
[3659.62 --> 3661.08]  The really cool thing,
[3661.12 --> 3661.26]  though,
[3661.32 --> 3662.26]  is that Luke
[3662.26 --> 3662.92]  has had both
[3662.92 --> 3664.20]  the blessing and curse
[3664.20 --> 3665.62]  of having one
[3665.62 --> 3668.40]  medium to large-scale creator
[3668.40 --> 3669.74]  to use as...
[3669.74 --> 3671.46]  and really, like,
[3671.54 --> 3672.90]  mad props
[3672.90 --> 3674.16]  to all of our viewers
[3674.16 --> 3676.18]  who have been with us
[3676.18 --> 3676.44]  through...
[3676.44 --> 3677.48]  Genuinely really appreciate it.
[3677.48 --> 3678.52]  Through Floatplanes Growing Pains,
[3678.56 --> 3679.98]  because you guys have been
[3679.98 --> 3681.30]  the testers for this.
[3681.54 --> 3682.20]  Not only that,
[3682.26 --> 3683.14]  you have funded
[3683.14 --> 3684.20]  a significant amount
[3684.20 --> 3684.86]  of the development
[3684.86 --> 3685.86]  of this platform
[3685.86 --> 3686.68]  indirectly.
[3687.08 --> 3687.80]  Like, we're still...
[3687.80 --> 3689.12]  We're still burning money.
[3689.28 --> 3690.56]  Like, we're still...
[3690.56 --> 3692.38]  It's still a startup.
[3692.54 --> 3693.20]  Whoop-a-doop-a-doop.
[3693.28 --> 3693.64]  Oh, yeah.
[3693.72 --> 3695.58]  But it has some revenue,
[3695.94 --> 3697.90]  and it has this proof of concept
[3697.90 --> 3698.64]  that we know
[3698.64 --> 3699.78]  that the model can work.
[3700.04 --> 3700.92]  And you guys have been
[3700.92 --> 3703.66]  just an incredible part of that
[3703.66 --> 3704.64]  in making it happen.
[3705.20 --> 3706.18]  So, anyway,
[3706.34 --> 3707.54]  we've had both the benefit
[3707.54 --> 3708.48]  and the drawback
[3708.48 --> 3710.12]  of having this scale
[3710.12 --> 3712.62]  that we have to live up to
[3712.62 --> 3714.66]  and that has taught us a lot
[3714.66 --> 3716.60]  about how to get ourselves ready
[3716.60 --> 3717.82]  to bring on other creators.
[3718.06 --> 3719.54]  There's been some buzz
[3719.54 --> 3721.54]  from some pretty big names.
[3721.54 --> 3725.32]  around creating alternatives
[3725.32 --> 3725.96]  to YouTube.
[3726.88 --> 3728.42]  And there was even one
[3728.42 --> 3730.02]  that was supposed to be,
[3730.08 --> 3731.00]  as far as I know,
[3731.18 --> 3732.00]  launched by now.
[3732.28 --> 3732.74]  A month ago.
[3732.76 --> 3733.48]  Yeah, like a month ago.
[3734.12 --> 3736.26]  And it's not.
[3736.52 --> 3737.48]  If we've learned anything
[3737.48 --> 3738.84]  about making this platform
[3738.84 --> 3740.40]  is setting launch dates
[3740.40 --> 3741.84]  is real scary
[3741.84 --> 3743.28]  and usually doesn't work out.
[3744.12 --> 3745.80]  And also that, like,
[3745.88 --> 3746.62]  what we're doing
[3746.62 --> 3748.34]  is not easy.
[3748.76 --> 3749.34]  And so, again,
[3749.44 --> 3750.52]  like, mad props this time
[3750.52 --> 3751.52]  to the Floatplane dev team.
[3751.54 --> 3752.78]  Because what you guys are doing
[3752.78 --> 3754.60]  would normally be done
[3754.60 --> 3756.44]  by a team of 30, 40 people
[3756.44 --> 3759.46]  with $50 million of VC backing.
[3759.98 --> 3761.86]  Like, that's the kind of project
[3761.86 --> 3762.50]  we're working on.
[3762.56 --> 3762.92]  And so, yeah,
[3762.96 --> 3764.00]  it's taken some time.
[3764.40 --> 3766.50]  But because of our amazing community,
[3766.98 --> 3768.10]  because of the tenacity
[3768.10 --> 3768.80]  of our devs,
[3768.80 --> 3769.68]  we are actually
[3769.68 --> 3773.12]  finally getting close
[3773.12 --> 3774.36]  to being able
[3774.36 --> 3775.70]  to bring on other creators
[3775.70 --> 3776.90]  and start to scale the thing out.
[3776.90 --> 3777.90]  because Luke,
[3777.90 --> 3779.68]  Luke, whose strength
[3779.68 --> 3781.66]  really wasn't organization
[3781.66 --> 3782.32]  when I met him.
[3786.12 --> 3787.42]  But he's learned a lot.
[3787.64 --> 3788.52]  Speaking of understanding.
[3789.08 --> 3790.92]  And we've taken
[3790.92 --> 3792.62]  a really building block
[3792.62 --> 3793.66]  style approach.
[3794.46 --> 3795.48]  In the early days,
[3795.54 --> 3796.18]  not so much,
[3796.30 --> 3796.98]  but we learned.
[3796.98 --> 3798.72]  And we've taken a really
[3798.72 --> 3800.34]  modular building block
[3800.34 --> 3801.02]  style approach
[3801.02 --> 3802.08]  to building the platform
[3802.08 --> 3803.16]  that makes it
[3803.16 --> 3804.58]  so that we will be able
[3804.58 --> 3805.22]  to scale it
[3805.22 --> 3806.14]  when the time comes.
[3806.30 --> 3807.38]  And add functionality
[3807.38 --> 3808.26]  much more easily
[3808.26 --> 3809.80]  than if you just
[3809.80 --> 3810.48]  kind of throw something
[3810.48 --> 3811.52]  together in 48 hours.
[3811.72 --> 3812.42]  Someone in chat was like,
[3812.48 --> 3812.92]  Luke's strength
[3812.92 --> 3814.42]  was grossly misrepresenting
[3814.42 --> 3815.08]  his experience.
[3817.32 --> 3818.46]  Yeah, pretty much.
[3818.62 --> 3819.00]  Yeah.
[3819.34 --> 3819.60]  Yeah.
[3819.60 --> 3821.18]  No, the funny thing
[3821.18 --> 3822.32]  is that Luke,
[3822.42 --> 3823.40]  oh, we had a freeze
[3823.40 --> 3823.80]  on OBS.
[3823.96 --> 3824.48]  So if people are
[3824.48 --> 3825.00]  complaining about
[3825.00 --> 3825.74]  a freeze in the stream,
[3825.86 --> 3826.40]  that was OBS.
[3826.58 --> 3827.20]  Okay, good to know.
[3827.58 --> 3828.58]  Someone in floatplane
[3828.58 --> 3829.16]  is spamming,
[3829.24 --> 3830.18]  I need notification.
[3830.36 --> 3831.18]  All right, sounds good, dude.
[3831.22 --> 3831.74]  Go turn it on
[3831.74 --> 3832.22]  in your settings.
[3832.72 --> 3833.08]  Oh, yeah,
[3833.14 --> 3834.16]  notifications are working.
[3834.30 --> 3835.44]  They technically exist.
[3835.56 --> 3836.10]  There's improvements
[3836.10 --> 3836.92]  that need to happen
[3836.92 --> 3837.24]  to those,
[3837.30 --> 3838.40]  just like almost everything else.
[3839.04 --> 3840.78]  But they technically exist.
[3840.86 --> 3841.50]  If you go into your settings,
[3841.60 --> 3842.16]  you can set on
[3842.16 --> 3843.10]  push notifications
[3843.10 --> 3844.14]  or email notifications
[3844.14 --> 3844.94]  per creator.
[3846.00 --> 3846.44]  Woo!
[3846.62 --> 3846.90]  Yeah!
[3847.40 --> 3848.56]  Oh, should we talk
[3848.56 --> 3849.26]  about the,
[3849.26 --> 3852.36]  our community
[3852.36 --> 3853.06]  is going to freak out
[3853.06 --> 3853.44]  about this.
[3853.66 --> 3854.74]  Paul just messaged me
[3854.74 --> 3855.74]  and said we should
[3855.74 --> 3857.14]  look into his conversation
[3857.14 --> 3857.68]  with Nyle.
[3858.24 --> 3858.94]  So I think we should
[3858.94 --> 3859.78]  almost dive into that
[3859.78 --> 3860.80]  a little bit more almost.
[3861.54 --> 3861.86]  Okay.
[3862.24 --> 3863.10]  Do you want to talk about this?
[3863.12 --> 3863.68]  We can talk about,
[3863.74 --> 3864.56]  it's not ready yet.
[3864.70 --> 3865.60]  Okay, that's fine.
[3865.70 --> 3865.98]  That's fine.
[3866.00 --> 3866.70]  So there's been
[3866.70 --> 3867.52]  some requests
[3867.52 --> 3868.52]  for floatplane to do.
[3868.52 --> 3868.56]  Some?
[3869.06 --> 3869.70]  There's been a lot
[3869.70 --> 3870.26]  of requests
[3870.26 --> 3871.54]  for floatplane to do
[3871.54 --> 3873.80]  more open source stuff.
[3873.90 --> 3874.50]  There's also been
[3874.50 --> 3875.22]  a lot of requests
[3875.22 --> 3877.72]  for apps to exist
[3877.72 --> 3879.80]  and other things.
[3879.94 --> 3880.62]  And one of the members
[3880.62 --> 3881.16]  on the team
[3881.16 --> 3882.26]  that I don't know
[3882.26 --> 3882.78]  if I'm,
[3883.76 --> 3884.40]  he's been on the team
[3884.40 --> 3885.12]  definitely long enough
[3885.12 --> 3886.32]  for me to say his name,
[3886.40 --> 3886.70]  but I don't know
[3886.70 --> 3887.66]  if he wants his name
[3887.66 --> 3888.20]  to be public.
[3888.32 --> 3889.66]  So I won't say it yet.
[3889.78 --> 3890.44]  I will figure that out
[3890.44 --> 3891.36]  later and then know later.
[3891.74 --> 3892.70]  But has been working
[3892.70 --> 3894.12]  on setting up
[3894.12 --> 3894.84]  the base
[3894.84 --> 3897.06]  of our mobile apps
[3897.06 --> 3897.96]  and then we're going
[3897.96 --> 3898.78]  to be working
[3898.78 --> 3901.26]  on making it open source
[3901.26 --> 3902.46]  so people can contribute
[3902.46 --> 3903.54]  to them if they would like.
[3903.84 --> 3904.52]  But we're trying
[3904.52 --> 3905.26]  to get the base
[3905.26 --> 3906.60]  really solid first
[3906.60 --> 3910.40]  and then open the API
[3910.40 --> 3911.20]  and do some other things
[3911.20 --> 3911.52]  like that
[3911.52 --> 3912.94]  so people can work
[3912.94 --> 3913.24]  with that
[3913.24 --> 3913.84]  if they would like.
[3913.90 --> 3914.74]  It's not necessarily
[3914.74 --> 3916.30]  about trying to save work
[3916.30 --> 3917.78]  or trying to save money.
[3917.96 --> 3918.58]  We were definitely
[3918.58 --> 3919.76]  willing to do it ourselves.
[3919.98 --> 3920.78]  It just was going
[3920.78 --> 3921.40]  to take longer
[3921.40 --> 3922.48]  and we've had a lot
[3922.48 --> 3923.40]  of members of our community
[3923.40 --> 3925.10]  to go like hey, honestly,
[3925.28 --> 3926.40]  I'd just love to help
[3926.40 --> 3926.80]  with this
[3926.80 --> 3927.58]  so that I could just
[3927.58 --> 3928.62]  have an app.
[3928.70 --> 3929.28]  There's people that have
[3929.28 --> 3930.62]  just made ones
[3930.62 --> 3931.54]  and I'm like okay,
[3931.64 --> 3932.48]  that's actually
[3932.48 --> 3933.04]  like really cool
[3933.04 --> 3933.70]  and impressive stuff
[3933.70 --> 3934.46]  but no.
[3934.58 --> 3935.74]  You can't do that.
[3936.66 --> 3938.58]  So yeah,
[3938.68 --> 3940.06]  we're running down
[3940.06 --> 3940.72]  that path.
[3940.96 --> 3941.38]  Like if there's
[3941.38 --> 3942.08]  going to be third party
[3942.08 --> 3942.78]  support for this
[3942.78 --> 3943.38]  initiative anyway,
[3943.50 --> 3944.16]  we just want to make sure
[3944.16 --> 3944.74]  that we're doing it
[3944.74 --> 3945.16]  properly.
[3945.58 --> 3945.72]  Yeah.
[3946.48 --> 3947.92]  And so this is
[3947.92 --> 3948.98]  a way for us
[3948.98 --> 3949.56]  to get something
[3949.56 --> 3950.32]  done faster
[3950.32 --> 3954.42]  and it's the weirdest
[3954.42 --> 3954.78]  thing.
[3954.88 --> 3955.44]  Give the community
[3955.44 --> 3956.14]  what they want
[3956.14 --> 3957.22]  which seems to be
[3957.22 --> 3958.30]  to help us out.
[3958.54 --> 3958.94]  Which is weird
[3958.94 --> 3959.84]  but like sure.
[3960.18 --> 3960.88]  But you guys are cool.
[3961.04 --> 3961.62]  You guys are awesome.
[3963.88 --> 3964.62]  So really,
[3964.86 --> 3965.84]  really excited about that.
[3966.06 --> 3967.00]  Do you want to pull up
[3967.00 --> 3968.62]  Paul's Twitter conversation
[3968.62 --> 3968.84]  there?
[3969.10 --> 3969.50]  Sure.
[3969.68 --> 3970.34]  Give me one second.
[3970.60 --> 3971.38]  When is Paul joining
[3971.38 --> 3971.78]  Floatplane?
[3972.60 --> 3973.98]  Well, he wants to.
[3974.50 --> 3975.58]  We just need to be ready.
[3975.76 --> 3976.40]  Oh, okay.
[3976.40 --> 3976.96]  So it's us.
[3977.06 --> 3977.26]  Yeah.
[3977.36 --> 3977.62]  Dang it.
[3977.62 --> 3977.98]  Yeah.
[3980.06 --> 3980.46]  Whoopsie.
[3980.68 --> 3981.44]  While you're looking
[3981.44 --> 3981.80]  that up,
[3981.84 --> 3982.16]  why don't I do
[3982.16 --> 3982.90]  a couple super chats
[3982.90 --> 3984.20]  because I saw a couple
[3984.20 --> 3985.86]  ridiculous ones come in.
[3986.86 --> 3988.12]  Biking with Panda.
[3988.34 --> 3989.24]  What kind of name is that?
[3989.64 --> 3991.48]  Love from the OpenZFS team.
[3991.58 --> 3992.56]  I hope Luke becomes
[3992.56 --> 3994.10]  a platform someday.
[3994.28 --> 3994.92]  Can you send me
[3994.92 --> 3995.96]  some jerky and coffee?
[3996.26 --> 3996.70]  Thanks, guys.
[3997.42 --> 3999.52]  That was a disjointed message.
[3999.68 --> 4000.68]  Thank you for that.
[4003.28 --> 4003.68]  Wow.
[4005.06 --> 4006.74]  iKatan11 says,
[4006.74 --> 4007.72]  love you guys' content.
[4007.78 --> 4008.22]  I've been watching you
[4008.22 --> 4008.80]  for years.
[4009.16 --> 4009.86]  Thank you.
[4009.96 --> 4010.48]  You rock.
[4011.48 --> 4012.24]  Jonas has got
[4012.24 --> 4013.22]  Floatplane last weekend.
[4013.36 --> 4013.90]  First time watching
[4013.90 --> 4014.38]  on Floatplane.
[4014.48 --> 4015.20]  It's so good.
[4015.96 --> 4016.42]  Good work.
[4017.04 --> 4017.26]  Thanks.
[4019.98 --> 4020.38]  Flagboy.
[4020.56 --> 4021.26]  Copyright in America
[4021.26 --> 4021.80]  is nuts.
[4021.90 --> 4022.38]  Big companies
[4022.38 --> 4023.28]  suing youth groups.
[4024.42 --> 4024.86]  Wow.
[4025.10 --> 4025.40]  Really?
[4026.28 --> 4027.32]  Like cheerleaders,
[4027.80 --> 4028.24]  dancing,
[4028.36 --> 4028.84]  Winter Guard,
[4028.96 --> 4029.30]  et cetera,
[4029.48 --> 4030.26]  for hundreds of thousands
[4030.26 --> 4030.62]  of dollars
[4030.62 --> 4031.12]  because they use
[4031.12 --> 4031.68]  their music.
[4032.44 --> 4033.08]  Oh, really?
[4033.92 --> 4034.16]  Yeah.
[4034.16 --> 4035.10]  Wow, that's rough.
[4035.22 --> 4035.48]  Oh, yeah.
[4036.66 --> 4037.60]  I don't know about
[4037.60 --> 4038.32]  the hundreds of thousands
[4038.32 --> 4039.38]  of dollars thing.
[4040.08 --> 4040.86]  I don't know about
[4040.86 --> 4041.46]  any of the values,
[4041.64 --> 4042.96]  but there's been
[4042.96 --> 4044.78]  tons of stuff.
[4045.04 --> 4045.12]  Yeah.
[4045.26 --> 4046.38]  The insider says
[4046.38 --> 4047.54]  they got banned
[4047.54 --> 4048.94]  by the Verge
[4048.94 --> 4051.78]  PC build guide
[4051.78 --> 4052.68]  creator guy,
[4052.94 --> 4053.28]  Stefan.
[4053.90 --> 4054.38]  So, yeah.
[4054.46 --> 4054.94]  No, I believe
[4054.94 --> 4055.54]  they were just like
[4055.54 --> 4056.14]  blocking people
[4056.14 --> 4056.54]  on Twitter
[4056.54 --> 4057.32]  and stuff like that.
[4057.32 --> 4058.76]  So, I've even heard
[4058.76 --> 4059.48]  of cases where
[4059.48 --> 4060.32]  like a dude
[4060.32 --> 4061.10]  was playing a radio
[4061.10 --> 4061.62]  in the back
[4061.62 --> 4062.22]  of his shop
[4062.22 --> 4063.08]  to literally
[4063.08 --> 4063.84]  just himself,
[4064.06 --> 4064.58]  but because it was
[4064.58 --> 4065.08]  on a commercial
[4065.08 --> 4065.54]  premises,
[4065.96 --> 4067.08]  they like tried
[4067.08 --> 4067.48]  to hit him
[4067.48 --> 4068.00]  with some
[4068.00 --> 4068.88]  something
[4068.88 --> 4069.82]  because a song
[4069.82 --> 4070.34]  was played.
[4071.28 --> 4071.78]  I don't remember.
[4071.88 --> 4072.54]  There's been some
[4072.54 --> 4073.14]  like absolutely
[4073.14 --> 4073.86]  crazy stuff.
[4074.00 --> 4074.56]  I have no idea.
[4075.24 --> 4076.04]  Wow, that's
[4076.04 --> 4076.70]  kind of nuts.
[4078.20 --> 4078.92]  Sam the Bird
[4078.92 --> 4079.16]  says,
[4079.24 --> 4079.54]  hey Luke,
[4079.64 --> 4080.14]  go on a date
[4080.14 --> 4081.04]  with me.
[4081.74 --> 4082.14]  Sorry.
[4082.28 --> 4082.94]  Gunner does games.
[4083.02 --> 4083.82]  Want to go to LTX
[4083.82 --> 4084.86]  but can't get off work.
[4085.00 --> 4085.78]  Oh, that's a bummer.
[4085.78 --> 4086.96]  Well, thanks for your
[4086.96 --> 4087.56]  support anyway
[4087.56 --> 4088.74]  and we will have
[4088.74 --> 4090.86]  like a virtual ticket
[4090.86 --> 4092.64]  so stay tuned for that.
[4093.32 --> 4094.46]  Luke's Alter Ego
[4094.46 --> 4095.34]  says ZTO.
[4096.42 --> 4097.44]  Cuke the Canuck,
[4097.66 --> 4098.32]  the world's most
[4098.32 --> 4099.40]  stereotypical Canadian.
[4099.64 --> 4100.20]  I like it.
[4100.38 --> 4101.08]  I like it.
[4101.44 --> 4102.00]  Great.
[4102.78 --> 4103.16]  I'm down.
[4104.12 --> 4105.06]  SPM says
[4105.06 --> 4106.06]  Riv Strong, Lyle.
[4107.10 --> 4108.28]  Riv Strong indeed.
[4108.52 --> 4109.10]  Oh, jeez.
[4109.26 --> 4109.66]  Oh, boy.
[4112.08 --> 4113.02]  PC Genius says
[4113.02 --> 4113.60]  love you, Luke.
[4113.66 --> 4114.42]  When is J's Two Cents
[4114.42 --> 4115.16]  coming to float plane?
[4115.66 --> 4116.20]  He's been,
[4116.60 --> 4117.36]  that's another one.
[4117.42 --> 4117.98]  Jay's wanted to join
[4117.98 --> 4118.64]  for a long time.
[4118.72 --> 4118.98]  It's just,
[4119.20 --> 4120.26]  I don't want their
[4120.26 --> 4121.38]  entrances to the platform
[4121.38 --> 4122.70]  to be really bad.
[4123.04 --> 4123.86]  I want it to be
[4123.86 --> 4124.50]  a good experience
[4124.50 --> 4125.00]  for the users
[4125.00 --> 4126.00]  and for them
[4126.00 --> 4127.52]  and float plane
[4127.52 --> 4128.40]  isn't quite there yet.
[4128.48 --> 4129.62]  We're getting really close.
[4129.92 --> 4130.80]  We're starting to feel it.
[4130.98 --> 4131.48]  The front page
[4131.48 --> 4132.24]  is coming on the website.
[4132.40 --> 4133.46]  We've got the
[4133.46 --> 4134.70]  multi-tiers thing
[4134.70 --> 4135.42]  coming along.
[4135.42 --> 4135.72]  Having a front page.
[4135.88 --> 4136.56]  Having a front page.
[4136.70 --> 4137.22]  Well, we could have
[4137.22 --> 4138.32]  literally done with Squarespace
[4138.32 --> 4139.32]  in 20 minutes.
[4139.40 --> 4141.18]  Yes, but we wanted to do it
[4141.18 --> 4142.12]  on our own site
[4142.12 --> 4143.36]  and all that kind of stuff.
[4143.36 --> 4146.02]  It's coming along.
[4146.18 --> 4146.76]  It's coming along.
[4146.76 --> 4148.30]  With the cover pages feature.
[4149.34 --> 4150.58]  It basically is
[4150.58 --> 4151.54]  the cover pages feature.
[4152.48 --> 4152.92]  Anyways.
[4153.18 --> 4153.82]  David says,
[4153.92 --> 4154.40]  I sent an email
[4154.40 --> 4155.62]  asking about the VIP ticket
[4155.62 --> 4156.22]  for LTX.
[4156.30 --> 4156.66]  Wanted to know
[4156.66 --> 4157.22]  if it included
[4157.22 --> 4157.96]  a two-day pass
[4157.96 --> 4159.28]  and DreamHack BYOC
[4159.28 --> 4159.74]  at night.
[4160.02 --> 4161.08]  I believe so.
[4162.64 --> 4163.66]  Yeah, I believe so.
[4163.82 --> 4164.28]  Stay tuned.
[4164.42 --> 4165.50]  I think the VIP tickets
[4165.50 --> 4166.66]  are going to go really fast.
[4167.06 --> 4167.46]  They're like,
[4167.96 --> 4169.04]  not going to be cheap.
[4169.04 --> 4170.16]  They are hundreds of dollars
[4170.16 --> 4170.90]  and I'm sorry,
[4171.38 --> 4173.10]  but that's already like,
[4173.88 --> 4174.82]  they'll already sell
[4174.82 --> 4175.42]  them like an hour.
[4175.64 --> 4175.82]  Yeah.
[4176.70 --> 4177.88]  They're almost under,
[4178.40 --> 4179.34]  they're expensive,
[4179.60 --> 4180.88]  but they're almost under,
[4181.96 --> 4182.66]  I don't even know
[4182.66 --> 4183.52]  how to word it.
[4183.52 --> 4184.22]  We talked about
[4184.22 --> 4185.76]  doubling the price this year.
[4186.32 --> 4187.20]  Just to,
[4187.34 --> 4188.02]  You're probably going to have to
[4188.02 --> 4188.38]  next year.
[4188.38 --> 4189.58]  Just to give people
[4189.58 --> 4192.16]  who aren't sitting there
[4192.16 --> 4193.32]  with their finger
[4193.32 --> 4193.82]  on the trigger
[4193.82 --> 4194.48]  ready to go
[4194.48 --> 4196.12]  a chance to get one.
[4196.12 --> 4198.34]  But then we were like,
[4198.64 --> 4199.24]  no.
[4200.06 --> 4200.86]  So it's actually,
[4200.98 --> 4201.24]  I believe,
[4201.30 --> 4201.94]  going to be the same
[4201.94 --> 4202.86]  prices last year.
[4202.96 --> 4203.68]  It's a hard case
[4203.68 --> 4204.34]  because if you,
[4204.42 --> 4205.40]  if you don't price it
[4205.40 --> 4206.00]  high enough,
[4206.32 --> 4207.28]  people are just going to
[4207.28 --> 4208.64]  buy them way too fast.
[4208.84 --> 4209.92]  And then there's just
[4209.92 --> 4210.44]  a ton of people
[4210.44 --> 4210.82]  that are mad.
[4210.92 --> 4211.42]  The only people
[4211.42 --> 4212.68]  with like watching bots
[4212.68 --> 4213.92]  are going to be the ones
[4213.92 --> 4214.62]  that notice it
[4214.62 --> 4215.60]  or scalpers
[4215.60 --> 4216.40]  are just going to buy it.
[4216.52 --> 4217.64]  If you price it way too high,
[4217.70 --> 4218.42]  then you look like a jerk.
[4218.50 --> 4219.36]  People will not be able
[4219.36 --> 4219.94]  to scalp them.
[4220.92 --> 4221.12]  Oh.
[4221.36 --> 4221.52]  Yeah,
[4221.66 --> 4222.76]  because the VIP ticket
[4222.76 --> 4224.54]  is personalized to you,
[4224.76 --> 4225.60]  the person who bought it.
[4225.72 --> 4225.84]  Cool.
[4226.12 --> 4227.26]  Um,
[4228.26 --> 4231.70]  okay.
[4232.74 --> 4233.10]  Yeah,
[4233.12 --> 4233.96]  I think I'm good for now.
[4234.76 --> 4236.12]  There's actually a bunch more.
[4236.50 --> 4236.88]  Um,
[4237.06 --> 4237.34]  yeah.
[4237.52 --> 4237.74]  Sorry,
[4237.80 --> 4238.10]  guys.
[4238.30 --> 4239.14]  There's like actually
[4239.14 --> 4239.62]  a lot more,
[4239.72 --> 4240.04]  but we're,
[4240.32 --> 4241.94]  we actually need to go home
[4241.94 --> 4242.46]  at some point.
[4242.54 --> 4243.38]  We went way over time.
[4243.44 --> 4243.68]  Do you have any?
[4243.68 --> 4244.12]  Let me still do this,
[4244.20 --> 4244.44]  Paul saying,
[4244.50 --> 4245.32]  there's one person
[4245.32 --> 4245.98]  in Flowplane chat
[4245.98 --> 4246.70]  who said they don't have
[4246.70 --> 4247.06]  the emote
[4247.06 --> 4247.64]  even though they've been
[4247.64 --> 4248.60]  subbed since the forum
[4248.60 --> 4249.62]  and I recognize your name
[4249.62 --> 4250.54]  and I know that's true.
[4250.88 --> 4251.54]  Contact support
[4251.54 --> 4252.32]  at flowplane.com.
[4252.80 --> 4253.54]  We'll get that taken care of.
[4253.70 --> 4253.82]  Okay.
[4253.82 --> 4255.24]  I even have a domain now
[4255.24 --> 4256.68]  with a support you can.
[4256.68 --> 4256.86]  See,
[4257.00 --> 4257.74]  things are coming along.
[4258.04 --> 4258.72]  Things are coming along.
[4258.82 --> 4258.98]  Okay,
[4259.12 --> 4260.00]  let's jump to here really quick.
[4260.66 --> 4260.90]  Uh,
[4260.96 --> 4261.14]  yeah,
[4261.18 --> 4261.34]  sure,
[4261.42 --> 4262.06]  I'm on your screen.
[4262.42 --> 4262.74]  Okay,
[4262.80 --> 4263.78]  so we've already read
[4263.78 --> 4264.58]  this first tweet.
[4264.58 --> 4265.30]  this is hilarious.
[4265.72 --> 4265.88]  This,
[4265.96 --> 4266.90]  this was great.
[4266.90 --> 4267.56]  I love how,
[4267.68 --> 4268.66]  how well it lined up
[4268.66 --> 4269.52]  with what we were saying.
[4269.82 --> 4270.58]  So Paul said,
[4270.66 --> 4271.00]  uh,
[4271.00 --> 4272.06]  this all could have been avoided
[4272.06 --> 4272.66]  if,
[4272.78 --> 4272.94]  well,
[4273.02 --> 4273.64]  he's quoting,
[4273.98 --> 4274.16]  uh,
[4274.16 --> 4275.16]  this all could have been avoided
[4275.16 --> 4275.52]  if,
[4275.68 --> 4276.18]  uh,
[4276.18 --> 4277.26]  they simply reached out
[4277.26 --> 4277.76]  to me directly,
[4277.76 --> 4278.18]  says,
[4278.50 --> 4278.74]  Nyle,
[4278.98 --> 4279.82]  hypocrisy,
[4280.00 --> 4281.18]  basically because the same thing
[4281.18 --> 4282.06]  could happen the other way around.
[4282.48 --> 4283.00]  Um,
[4283.72 --> 4285.00]  then he just did a screenshot
[4285.00 --> 4286.02]  of the article.
[4286.24 --> 4286.84]  Um,
[4287.18 --> 4288.00]  moving on.
[4288.80 --> 4289.00]  Do,
[4289.46 --> 4289.78]  Nyle,
[4289.84 --> 4290.12]  there's,
[4290.16 --> 4291.22]  there's a few other responses.
[4291.82 --> 4292.84]  Nyle responds directly.
[4292.94 --> 4293.64]  Hopefully I'm saying
[4293.64 --> 4294.48]  your name right.
[4294.54 --> 4295.14]  Sorry if I'm not.
[4295.14 --> 4295.94]  Um,
[4296.22 --> 4297.54]  it's not a reality show.
[4297.64 --> 4298.34]  None of the stakeholders
[4298.34 --> 4299.36]  actually reached out.
[4299.48 --> 4299.86]  And again,
[4299.96 --> 4301.66]  it's reversed the,
[4301.86 --> 4303.30]  I reversed the strike on Wednesday.
[4303.84 --> 4304.04]  Uh,
[4304.04 --> 4304.64]  Paul said,
[4304.72 --> 4305.36]  did you make any attempt
[4305.36 --> 4305.94]  to reach out to them
[4305.94 --> 4306.88]  before having your legal team
[4306.88 --> 4307.86]  take action that affected
[4307.86 --> 4309.10]  their ability to make a living?
[4309.22 --> 4309.88]  If not,
[4310.00 --> 4310.60]  saying they should have
[4310.60 --> 4311.30]  reached out to us first
[4311.30 --> 4312.20]  carries zero weight.
[4312.88 --> 4313.58]  Nyle says,
[4313.78 --> 4315.08]  I do not think our team
[4315.08 --> 4316.28]  should use the strike system.
[4316.42 --> 4316.76]  No,
[4316.94 --> 4318.04]  which is why I reversed it.
[4319.26 --> 4319.62]  What?
[4319.96 --> 4320.24]  Okay.
[4320.34 --> 4321.42]  That didn't answer Paul's question.
[4321.72 --> 4321.92]  All right.
[4322.00 --> 4322.18]  No,
[4322.18 --> 4323.14]  that's what he says.
[4323.18 --> 4323.42]  He's like,
[4323.44 --> 4324.34]  you didn't answer my question.
[4324.72 --> 4324.78]  Hey,
[4324.78 --> 4325.46]  Paul.
[4325.66 --> 4325.98]  Hey,
[4325.98 --> 4328.70]  you didn't answer my question.
[4328.82 --> 4329.70]  This is a mind meld
[4329.70 --> 4331.26]  we've got going on here right now.
[4331.90 --> 4332.98]  You seem to not want
[4332.98 --> 4334.08]  to admit any fault
[4334.08 --> 4335.16]  or accept responsibility
[4335.16 --> 4336.46]  for anything in this situation.
[4336.66 --> 4337.88]  So you're blaming your team
[4337.88 --> 4338.80]  for issuing the strike,
[4338.92 --> 4339.58]  but you're the one
[4339.58 --> 4340.70]  who took action to remove it.
[4340.94 --> 4341.78]  I removed the strike.
[4342.02 --> 4343.54]  I did not make a series of videos
[4343.54 --> 4344.62]  that led to an obvious
[4344.62 --> 4346.02]  coordinated harassment campaign.
[4346.06 --> 4347.92]  What are you even talking about?
[4348.44 --> 4349.78]  What led to the coordinated
[4349.78 --> 4350.80]  harassment campaign
[4350.80 --> 4352.20]  was you didn't pull your video
[4352.20 --> 4353.38]  immediately when it was
[4353.38 --> 4354.44]  obviously horrible?
[4355.88 --> 4356.62]  And yeah,
[4356.68 --> 4357.68]  it was like problematic
[4357.68 --> 4359.06]  as it was a guide.
[4360.92 --> 4361.86]  Paul said,
[4362.08 --> 4362.32]  well,
[4362.40 --> 4363.16]  then you're obviously
[4363.16 --> 4364.06]  the victim here
[4364.06 --> 4365.24]  at the mercy of
[4365.24 --> 4365.48]  Okay,
[4365.52 --> 4366.42]  basically what I just said.
[4366.42 --> 4367.22]  YouTuber coordinator
[4367.22 --> 4367.86]  asked for grid,
[4367.98 --> 4368.90]  which we activated
[4368.90 --> 4369.86]  because we are evil.
[4370.06 --> 4371.08]  Couldn't possibly be
[4371.08 --> 4371.98]  that you're in the wrong
[4371.98 --> 4373.00]  and a bunch of people agree
[4373.00 --> 4373.76]  that based on
[4373.76 --> 4375.32]  preponderance of evidence.
[4376.06 --> 4376.46]  Again,
[4376.58 --> 4377.32]  I reversed the strike
[4377.32 --> 4377.76]  on Wednesday.
[4377.96 --> 4379.80]  No one's saying you didn't.
[4379.86 --> 4380.56]  I appreciate that
[4380.56 --> 4381.18]  you did that quickly,
[4381.28 --> 4382.86]  but no one's saying you didn't.
[4383.14 --> 4384.04]  Before any of this
[4384.04 --> 4384.76]  went sideways,
[4385.22 --> 4386.92]  the criticism,
[4387.22 --> 4387.96]  whatever it is,
[4388.30 --> 4390.04]  of a thing that I undid.
[4390.14 --> 4391.38]  Is of a thing that I undid.
[4391.40 --> 4392.24]  Is of a thing that I undid.
[4392.48 --> 4393.40]  And the nature of that
[4393.40 --> 4394.28]  criticism is
[4394.28 --> 4395.86]  coordinated and toxic.
[4395.86 --> 4396.76]  What do you mean coordinated?
[4396.90 --> 4398.02]  No one's coordinating this.
[4398.02 --> 4399.42]  I'm the like,
[4399.72 --> 4401.12]  what's that app
[4401.12 --> 4401.82]  where all the chat,
[4402.10 --> 4403.80]  where all the tech YouTubers
[4403.80 --> 4404.94]  have this signal account
[4404.94 --> 4406.14]  that we all message?
[4406.26 --> 4406.38]  Yeah,
[4406.48 --> 4406.58]  well,
[4406.66 --> 4406.80]  no,
[4406.86 --> 4407.78]  it's not an app.
[4408.32 --> 4408.80]  Like it's way,
[4409.04 --> 4409.30]  no,
[4409.44 --> 4410.32]  it's a big,
[4410.48 --> 4410.90]  it's okay.
[4411.14 --> 4412.36]  Assassin's Creed carrier pigeons.
[4412.58 --> 4413.26]  It's got a cylinder.
[4413.64 --> 4413.90]  Okay.
[4414.20 --> 4414.34]  Yeah,
[4414.34 --> 4414.50]  yeah.
[4414.52 --> 4415.26]  It's got a cylinder
[4415.26 --> 4416.62]  and then there's like,
[4416.68 --> 4417.92]  there's like this,
[4417.98 --> 4420.48]  like this metal kind of frame piece
[4420.48 --> 4421.56]  that goes across the front.
[4421.66 --> 4421.86]  Sure.
[4421.94 --> 4422.10]  Okay.
[4422.18 --> 4422.38]  Yeah.
[4422.52 --> 4424.16]  And it stands about this high.
[4424.42 --> 4425.18]  So you got the cylinder
[4425.18 --> 4426.14]  with this frame piece
[4426.14 --> 4426.86]  on the front here
[4426.86 --> 4428.42]  and then it's got a big light
[4428.42 --> 4429.02]  in the back
[4429.02 --> 4431.04]  and you aim it at the sky.
[4431.40 --> 4431.56]  Oh,
[4431.66 --> 4431.84]  yeah.
[4431.98 --> 4432.18]  Yeah.
[4432.70 --> 4433.04]  Okay.
[4433.14 --> 4433.86]  It's got a bat.
[4438.52 --> 4439.42]  Tech YouTuber,
[4439.60 --> 4440.34]  under attack.
[4441.78 --> 4443.28]  Come support immediately.
[4444.62 --> 4445.68]  Frickin' ridiculous.
[4445.68 --> 4450.66]  The coordinated and toxic attack.
[4451.30 --> 4452.74]  I am firm in saying
[4452.74 --> 4453.92]  that is unacceptable.
[4454.84 --> 4454.94]  Well,
[4455.00 --> 4455.34]  I completely,
[4455.50 --> 4456.44]  Paul now says,
[4456.54 --> 4456.62]  well,
[4456.64 --> 4457.40]  I completely disagree,
[4457.54 --> 4458.44]  but thanks for replying here
[4458.44 --> 4458.78]  at least.
[4459.06 --> 4459.82]  I think everyone now
[4459.82 --> 4460.84]  has a much clearer idea
[4460.84 --> 4461.94]  of what your official stance
[4461.94 --> 4462.44]  is on the matter.
[4462.64 --> 4463.50]  I think his official stance
[4463.50 --> 4464.46]  is that he took it
[4464.46 --> 4465.74]  back on Wednesday.
[4466.24 --> 4467.68]  He took it back on Wednesday.
[4468.08 --> 4469.54]  I reversed it on Wednesday.
[4469.62 --> 4471.28]  And we took the original video down.
[4471.28 --> 4475.56]  All right.
[4475.90 --> 4476.84]  So on that note,
[4476.94 --> 4477.86]  the man show is over.
[4478.00 --> 4479.20]  We'll see you guys again next week.
[4479.28 --> 4480.10]  Same bat time,
[4480.22 --> 4481.02]  same bat channel.
[4481.28 --> 4482.00]  Maybe that's why
[4482.00 --> 4482.88]  I always say that.
[4483.00 --> 4484.36]  Maybe if I don't say that,
[4484.76 --> 4486.24]  everyone coordinates.
[4487.04 --> 4487.44]  And they go,
[4487.64 --> 4488.38]  something's happening.
[4488.48 --> 4489.04]  Something's happening.
[4489.10 --> 4490.32]  He didn't say the Batman outro.
[4490.34 --> 4490.58]  Yeah.
[4491.78 --> 4492.18]  Well,
[4492.22 --> 4492.86]  I did today.
[4493.12 --> 4493.48]  Yes.
[4493.76 --> 4494.14]  We're good.
[4494.54 --> 4494.74]  Bye,
[4494.82 --> 4495.02]  everyone.
[4495.26 --> 4495.60]  Bye.
[4496.16 --> 4497.34]  That was a long show.
[4497.54 --> 4497.76]  Yeah.
[4498.32 --> 4499.60]  We had something to talk about.
[4500.02 --> 4500.40]  I know,
[4500.46 --> 4500.62]  right?
[4501.28 --> 4512.90]  I totally forgot about that.
[4512.96 --> 4513.40]  Me too.
[4513.72 --> 4514.36]  See,
[4514.40 --> 4515.40]  but they did the right thing.
[4515.56 --> 4517.28]  They didn't start coffee striking people
[4517.28 --> 4518.88]  months after the event
[4518.88 --> 4520.30]  to remind everyone about
