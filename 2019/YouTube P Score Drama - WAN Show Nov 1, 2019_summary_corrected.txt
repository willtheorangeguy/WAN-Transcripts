• YouTube exposed new HTML code showing P-scores of videos and channels
• P-scores are used to quantify a channel's performance, with high scores indicating better quality content
• The granularity of P-scores allows for small differences in score to significantly impact ranking
• A data set of top YouTubers' P-scores revealed that the host's score is among the top 10, beating other popular channels such as BBC News and Will Smith
• P-scores are not new, but their exact values were previously unknown to the public
• The Google Preferred lineup is a select set of YouTubers vetted for high-quality content and advertiser-friendliness.
• This lineup was created after the Apocalypse in 2018, where big brands stopped advertising on YouTube due to associations with low-quality or objectionable content.
• Creators are added to the Google Preferred list through an automated system, which now uses a P score to determine their safety and advertiser-friendliness based on five dimensions: popularity, passion, protection, platform, and production values.
• The P score is a more granular way of measuring a channel's quality compared to previous methods of dividing creators into top 1% or top 5% categories.

• Use of machine learning to detect distracting background noise

• Impact of trending on video performance: lower CPMs and higher bounce rates
• P score does not appear to generate more revenue for creators in a meaningful way
• Creators are sensitive about sharing ad fill rates, CPMs, RPMs, and effective rates per view or per million views
• Comparison between high-P-score channels and gaming channels shows lower RPMs for the former
• YouTube Premium viewers are worth 6-10x more than ad-supported viewers
• Mid-roll ads can be intrusive and less effective
• Creators would prefer to work with brands directly for sponsorships
• Integrations that are built into videos with the host's voice can command higher CPMs
