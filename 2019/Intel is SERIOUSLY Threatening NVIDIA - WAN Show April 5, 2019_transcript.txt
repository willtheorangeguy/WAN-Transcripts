[0.88 --> 7.12]  It's weird. Everything's different and it makes me uncomfortable. I can't handle it.
[7.76 --> 12.38]  Welcome to the WAN show, guys. I'm afraid it's going to be a little bit late. Normally when we start
[12.38 --> 16.24]  10 minutes late, we try to also run 10 minutes late, but today we simply
[16.24 --> 25.10]  do not have that option because it's time. It's the night. I am so freaking nervous. Me too.
[25.10 --> 32.18]  For lots of reasons. That's my smartwatch. I actually talked about this extensively on the WAN show
[32.18 --> 37.16]  yesterday. Oh, last week. Number of steps reached. I just hit my target.
[37.42 --> 42.70]  There you go. Sitting here. Good job. Oh, this thing's terrible. It's terrible.
[43.24 --> 51.86]  So I'm actually writing my review of it from the perspective of everything that I love about it
[51.86 --> 59.64]  or everything that I love about what it could be. The ideas that I love. Except it's awful.
[60.56 --> 62.84]  Yeah. So it's going to, I think the title is probably going to be
[62.84 --> 63.68]  Who makes it?
[63.82 --> 68.24]  The worst thing I've, I've ever loved or something like that.
[68.26 --> 69.40]  Okay. You love it though.
[69.76 --> 72.42]  I love where we're going.
[72.58 --> 73.58]  Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[73.94 --> 76.26]  Smartwatch isn't responding. Close app or wait. What do you mean?
[77.54 --> 78.98]  The entire smartwatch.
[78.98 --> 82.64]  And we're back.
[84.70 --> 85.68]  That's funky.
[86.36 --> 91.48]  Anyway. Yeah. So I actually, I wrote about half of it before the WAN show today. I had
[91.48 --> 97.04]  wanted to get that shot this week, but it didn't happen. Sorry. Soon though. Soon though.
[97.12 --> 98.06]  I'm excited. I'm excited.
[98.06 --> 101.18]  It looks to me. The reason why I asked it, it looks to me like a Kickstarter product.
[101.82 --> 106.14]  No, no. This is made by Nubia. They like have real like phones and stuff.
[106.14 --> 113.96]  Yeah. Yeah. Okay. What just happened? Oh, I have alpha gesture on, which is like their air wavy thing.
[113.96 --> 118.28]  Okay. So when you go to use the screen, it's like double register.
[118.92 --> 120.40]  Great. Really, really good design.
[120.46 --> 120.66]  Brilliant.
[120.96 --> 121.38]  10 out of 10.
[122.36 --> 125.00]  So I, uh, tonight.
[125.00 --> 129.28]  To bring it back to the roast, someone in Flowplane chat said, will Luke roast Linus?
[130.16 --> 130.56]  Kappa.
[130.84 --> 136.70]  Uh, well, I don't know. Are you planning to just go up and say really nice things about me? Cause that would be pretty cool.
[137.50 --> 144.22]  I was, I was informed that that's against the rules. I actually thought about at one point in time, just going up and complimenting everyone.
[144.22 --> 151.32]  But like in really weird ways. Uh, and then that was, that was a no.
[151.78 --> 155.48]  Yeah, no, that would be a hard no because then everyone else has to feel bad.
[155.96 --> 157.54]  That's why I wanted to do it.
[159.22 --> 160.56]  Just to be a jerk.
[160.90 --> 161.30]  Yeah.
[161.58 --> 163.70]  To actually be the worst kind of jerk.
[163.70 --> 168.94]  Cause everyone just feels like, yeah, it's really awkward when they go up and try to make fun of me.
[169.18 --> 179.14]  Um, so people are asking about, uh, so we'll talk more about why we are respectively worried about the roast cause I've got my own whole set of reasons and I'm sure so do you.
[179.14 --> 179.46]  Yeah.
[179.62 --> 186.80]  But, uh, people on Flowplane are asking, um, what's going on with our streaming on Flowplane right now?
[186.84 --> 190.08]  So last night I did a test and it was pretty bad.
[190.76 --> 191.04]  Yeah.
[191.04 --> 196.60]  Um, and we're expecting for the roast, which I believe the live stream starts in three hours.
[196.70 --> 197.56]  Does that sound right to you?
[198.78 --> 199.22]  Yeah.
[199.40 --> 201.10]  Three hours and 29 minutes.
[201.42 --> 202.70]  At 8.30 is when it starts.
[202.74 --> 203.02]  Is that right?
[203.06 --> 203.56]  I believe so.
[204.52 --> 204.82]  Okay.
[205.16 --> 205.56]  Uh.
[205.58 --> 207.54]  I don't entirely know, but I think so.
[208.18 --> 208.98]  Hopefully soon.
[209.52 --> 210.28]  Um, okay.
[210.40 --> 211.16]  At any rate.
[211.48 --> 212.70]  Oh, that's a really good idea.
[212.82 --> 215.08]  Dominic says TechLinked Classic T is amazing.
[215.28 --> 216.68]  They should do a WAN Classic T.
[217.00 --> 218.42]  Have you seen the TechLinked Classic T?
[218.44 --> 218.66]  Yeah.
[219.04 --> 219.24]  Yeah.
[219.24 --> 220.00]  Just like clean.
[220.08 --> 220.90]  Just the logo, right?
[220.90 --> 221.08]  Yeah.
[221.08 --> 222.04]  It's in your, it's in your merch bin.
[222.82 --> 224.70]  Uh, I think Lloyd just brought one down.
[224.96 --> 226.38]  He brought it at the last second, I think.
[226.80 --> 226.92]  No.
[226.92 --> 227.18]  Are you sure?
[227.48 --> 227.66]  Yeah.
[227.92 --> 228.16]  Oh.
[228.28 --> 228.56]  All right.
[228.82 --> 228.86]  Maybe.
[229.06 --> 229.44]  Oh, wait.
[229.50 --> 230.48]  Did he add this one in?
[230.56 --> 230.78]  Yes.
[230.88 --> 231.84]  He added it at the very end.
[231.84 --> 232.56]  Ah, there we go.
[232.60 --> 233.76]  Yeah, no, that's super sharp.
[233.84 --> 234.66]  Yeah, it's like really clean.
[234.66 --> 234.92]  This guy.
[235.00 --> 237.34]  I think a WAN Classic would actually look really good.
[237.48 --> 238.08]  That would be pretty cool.
[238.08 --> 238.36]  Anyway.
[238.36 --> 238.44]  Anyway.
[238.68 --> 245.22]  Um, so we did a test last night because, how much are you guys talking about the architecture
[245.22 --> 245.56]  of it?
[245.56 --> 246.38]  We can talk about it.
[246.48 --> 252.62]  So, um, when we first started streaming on Floatplane, it was through Floatplane CDN,
[252.68 --> 254.48]  except it didn't work with the Edge servers.
[254.48 --> 259.36]  So, basically, what that means is there was the uploader that was sending their stream
[259.36 --> 264.66]  to the origin server, and that server was sending the stream to everyone, that one server,
[264.84 --> 265.66]  in that one location.
[265.92 --> 267.12]  And it was really bad.
[267.50 --> 272.80]  And we've improved it a little bit over time on our own, and we've integrated a few other
[272.80 --> 273.90]  CDNs that we've tried.
[274.48 --> 279.22]  But very recently, we started working with Cloudflare, very recently as in yesterday.
[280.54 --> 282.28]  And Linus and I did a couple test streams.
[282.28 --> 287.80]  And I did one, and everything wasn't cached, and there was some other various problems.
[288.02 --> 289.38]  And then Linus did one, and it was terrible.
[289.42 --> 290.00]  It was hot garbage.
[290.12 --> 294.10]  Because of DNS problems and cache problems.
[294.18 --> 298.06]  So people needed to control F5 their page, and there was a few other problems as well.
[298.54 --> 304.00]  Now, we're doing a combo attack because of a problem that we had with our Edge server,
[304.30 --> 309.58]  where we're taking the stream from the creator, bringing it to our origin server, streaming
[309.58 --> 315.30]  it right now, at least with this stream, to Twitch and to YouTube, and streaming it to
[315.30 --> 321.78]  another CDN, which is then streaming from that CDN to Cloudflare, which is then streaming
[321.78 --> 322.78]  to you guys.
[323.04 --> 325.62]  And somehow, the latency is still super fast.
[326.96 --> 327.48]  Okay.
[327.56 --> 328.62]  And it seems to be pretty good.
[328.86 --> 329.12]  Okay.
[329.12 --> 333.00]  I've had a couple people complaining that they're switching between 480 and 1080.
[334.26 --> 338.28]  Unfortunately, that's not a Cloudflare or anyone else problem.
[338.28 --> 338.48]  Right.
[338.76 --> 345.52]  And an experience that we've noticed is that over time, it should get a little bit better,
[345.72 --> 351.22]  because the weird auto-detection logic that we have on our side is assuming it's bad, and
[351.22 --> 354.00]  then going like, oh, it's actually pretty good, and then giving them more.
[354.54 --> 355.26]  Got it.
[355.50 --> 355.94]  Okay.
[356.04 --> 356.22]  Yeah.
[356.22 --> 356.78]  Got it.
[356.82 --> 359.06]  We've actually got a lot of really good feedback, though.
[359.66 --> 360.22]  So, uh...
[360.22 --> 360.38]  Yeah.
[360.92 --> 363.10]  It's obviously not perfect yet.
[363.34 --> 365.44]  Is it just me, or is the audio much better on Floatplane?
[365.54 --> 370.00]  Believe it or not, that is actually one of the things that we identified early on with
[370.00 --> 373.76]  Floatplane as an easy way to differentiate ourselves from YouTube.
[373.90 --> 377.54]  YouTube compresses the audio so much, and it's so unnecessary.
[377.80 --> 379.04]  It's actually a pretty small day.
[379.04 --> 384.64]  High-quality audio versus low-quality audio is such a small difference in the bitrate
[384.64 --> 390.00]  when you're serving video that we were just looking at it going, what are they doing?
[390.10 --> 391.36]  Might as well just not touch it.
[391.48 --> 392.66]  Just kind of let it go.
[393.10 --> 399.74]  It makes such a big difference compared to the gain that you get back from it.
[400.16 --> 402.84]  Max 2387 says, so glad I subscribed on Floatplane.
[402.92 --> 403.90]  This is so much better.
[404.64 --> 404.82]  Yeah.
[404.82 --> 408.40]  So, like, we have a lot of people right now that have a notably better experience.
[408.42 --> 409.10]  Silver side up.
[409.24 --> 411.18]  Holy hell, the difference in quality is amazing.
[411.56 --> 411.74]  Yeah.
[412.14 --> 414.66]  There are some people that it's still going to be not great for.
[414.74 --> 418.94]  There are some people that are still going to have some quality auto-detection problems.
[419.72 --> 422.16]  There's obviously going to be some other problems as well.
[422.16 --> 426.64]  But we think the solution that we have now is better than the solution that we had a week ago.
[426.72 --> 429.48]  And the solution that we had a week ago is better than the solution that we had four months ago.
[429.58 --> 430.72]  So it's improving.
[430.86 --> 432.34]  Someone says they hear a fan in the background.
[432.50 --> 438.00]  That's actually the mini-fridge for our sponsor for the roast, Madrinas, that is running in the background.
[438.00 --> 438.20]  Get it.
[438.24 --> 438.44]  Sorry.
[439.20 --> 439.94]  Next week.
[442.02 --> 444.22]  Next week, we won't have that.
[444.50 --> 444.68]  Yeah.
[444.82 --> 446.56]  The fan noise is just a little...
[446.56 --> 446.80]  Yeah.
[447.10 --> 447.62]  It's okay, though.
[447.62 --> 448.22]  Okay.
[448.42 --> 453.12]  Got people asking, are you going to archive the roast in full on Floatplane?
[454.04 --> 455.68]  I can't promise that.
[456.00 --> 456.54]  Solid maybe.
[456.98 --> 457.18]  Yeah.
[457.48 --> 459.82]  If we can, we will.
[460.30 --> 465.62]  But it's possible that someone will say something that is just...
[466.38 --> 467.10]  Deplorable.
[467.46 --> 473.34]  Not acceptable to me on the Linus Tech Tips channel.
[473.44 --> 473.76]  Period.
[473.76 --> 476.80]  There's some alcohol involved.
[477.62 --> 479.58]  And there's going to be heightened emotions.
[481.24 --> 482.62]  So I think we're just...
[482.62 --> 483.38]  We're going to play it safe.
[484.36 --> 485.12]  So...
[485.12 --> 486.08]  Probably.
[486.74 --> 487.10]  Yeah, I think it'll be okay.
[487.10 --> 488.34]  I mean, the people that we've got...
[488.34 --> 489.42]  So the people on the dais...
[489.42 --> 489.82]  Dais?
[489.98 --> 490.32]  Dais.
[490.92 --> 491.32]  Dais?
[491.48 --> 491.86]  Dais?
[492.00 --> 493.02]  I think it's dais.
[493.14 --> 493.32]  Sure.
[493.46 --> 494.14]  But I don't really know.
[494.20 --> 495.26]  So the people on the dais...
[495.26 --> 495.64]  Dais?
[495.98 --> 496.72]  It doesn't matter.
[497.06 --> 497.30]  Okay.
[498.08 --> 503.02]  Are going to be Luke, Nick, Yvonne, James.
[503.30 --> 504.92]  He's actually, like, kind of the MC.
[505.20 --> 506.70]  So he's only sort of on the dais.
[506.70 --> 506.90]  Yeah.
[509.02 --> 510.10]  Who else is internal?
[510.22 --> 512.12]  Dennis is going to be on it.
[513.38 --> 513.78]  Luke.
[514.24 --> 514.34]  Nick.
[514.34 --> 514.52]  Riley.
[515.44 --> 515.84]  Riley.
[516.50 --> 517.42]  And then we've got...
[517.42 --> 517.88]  I've got Nick.
[518.08 --> 518.30]  Okay.
[518.32 --> 521.46]  And then we've got three celebrity guests, which I am so excited.
[521.66 --> 524.26]  Like, these guys really went out of their way.
[524.34 --> 527.02]  It is a lot of work to prepare for something like this.
[527.38 --> 528.46]  They're not being paid.
[528.46 --> 532.70]  All we compensated them for was just their travel and their accommodations.
[533.02 --> 538.52]  So this is really genuinely out of the goodness of their hearts and because they just wanted to contribute.
[538.66 --> 539.20]  Goodness of their hearts.
[539.32 --> 541.66]  I've already been told by one of them that they're just laying into me.
[541.66 --> 546.98]  So Steve from Gamers Nexus is going to be there tonight.
[547.10 --> 548.62]  He was actually here in the studio today.
[548.70 --> 550.16]  We were shooting a really fun video.
[550.40 --> 552.82]  Water cooling and overclocking a laptop.
[553.34 --> 553.52]  Nice.
[553.52 --> 556.84]  Jay's Two Cents is going to be there.
[557.78 --> 560.66]  And why am I trying to blame Kyle?
[561.16 --> 562.20]  Kyle from Bitwit.
[562.40 --> 563.10]  I know, right?
[563.68 --> 572.06]  So not only is Kyle going to be there, but if you're subscribed to him on Floatplane as well, you will get access to the roast.
[572.40 --> 573.54]  Exact same quality.
[573.80 --> 574.88]  The chats will be split.
[575.04 --> 575.94]  The chats will be split.
[575.94 --> 585.20]  So anyone who follows either Linus Tech Tips or Bitwit on Floatplane is going to have access to the stream when it starts in a couple of hours.
[586.32 --> 588.44]  So get hyped.
[588.58 --> 589.00]  Get hyped.
[590.28 --> 591.06]  Oh, man.
[592.46 --> 593.50]  I'm really nervous.
[593.70 --> 598.34]  One little deficiency on Floatplane that I'm just going to announce right now is we have notifications for videos.
[598.46 --> 599.90]  We don't have notifications for live streams.
[600.30 --> 603.52]  So maybe hang out on the page and you should be good to go.
[603.96 --> 604.36]  Yeah.
[604.80 --> 605.12]  Sorry.
[605.12 --> 606.72]  We could do what I did last night.
[606.86 --> 607.12]  We could.
[607.12 --> 609.26]  We could upload a short video saying, hey.
[610.08 --> 610.78]  Come check out the stream.
[611.02 --> 611.62]  Go check out the stream live.
[611.62 --> 613.66]  That's what we used to do back in the day for WAN shows.
[613.76 --> 614.24]  Yeah, I know, right?
[614.62 --> 615.80]  So, like, it's not that weird.
[616.22 --> 618.54]  That might be a decent idea, actually.
[618.92 --> 619.20]  So, yeah.
[619.32 --> 625.24]  If you guys are more into Kyle than you are into us, then just go to Floatplane.com, sign up, and then subscribe to Kyle.
[625.70 --> 629.96]  And if you're more into Linus Tech Tips, then go to Floatplane.com, sign up, subscribe to us.
[629.96 --> 638.48]  If you're more into both of them, right now, each of us is only $3 a month for early access and behind the scenes and whatever it is that we upload there.
[638.48 --> 640.56]  So that's probably going up.
[640.62 --> 641.46]  I wouldn't be surprised.
[641.70 --> 646.10]  Linus Media Group is definitely raising pricing once the tiered thing rolls out properly.
[646.10 --> 657.64]  And I wouldn't be surprised if other guys do, too, because the reality of it is with payment processors taking as much as they do, there's just not that much left in very small transaction amounts.
[660.22 --> 668.56]  So it's, like, it's one of those really frustrating things because, on the one hand, we understand that a lot of people can only give a little bit, and we absolutely appreciate that.
[668.80 --> 674.00]  But on the other hand, quite frankly, Visa and MasterCard and PayPal don't need to get that much richer.
[674.00 --> 680.30]  And they are taking such a significant portion of very small payments that it's ridiculous.
[680.68 --> 682.82]  Yeah, because there's a flat fee from the processor.
[682.82 --> 683.14]  That's right.
[683.30 --> 685.40]  Then there's the percentage fee from the credit card.
[685.50 --> 687.02]  Then we've got to pay for our infrastructure.
[687.26 --> 688.36]  Then we've got to pay for our people.
[688.94 --> 691.58]  Then we've got to give money to the creators.
[691.92 --> 694.02]  So it starts to dwindle down really fast.
[694.36 --> 697.14]  People are asking if people from now will be grandfathered in.
[697.20 --> 698.16]  Yes, that's the intention.
[698.16 --> 708.16]  However, that doesn't mean that there won't be new tiers with, like, higher quality or, you know, blog posts or, you know, early access to the scripts before we shoot them.
[708.18 --> 708.78]  Or, like, I don't know.
[708.84 --> 712.64]  We could come up with cool stuff that we could do, and that would be at new pricing in all likelihood.
[713.38 --> 719.02]  It's also likely that we would recognize our OG subscribers with some kind of special emote.
[720.14 --> 722.14]  Even site-wide, actually, might be kind of cool.
[722.82 --> 724.04]  Could we do a site-wide emote?
[724.04 --> 725.64]  Like, we launched now?
[725.72 --> 728.72]  Because we did a pre-full platform emote.
[728.82 --> 731.04]  We could do a pre-launch emote.
[731.10 --> 733.48]  Like a launch pad emote or something like that.
[733.48 --> 733.50]  That would be kind of cool.
[733.96 --> 734.44]  Runway?
[734.54 --> 735.10]  That would be kind of neat.
[735.18 --> 735.42]  Yeah.
[736.16 --> 736.42]  Ooh.
[736.88 --> 737.58]  Except no.
[737.58 --> 737.92]  It's a flow plane.
[737.94 --> 738.52]  Because it's water.
[738.58 --> 738.74]  Yeah.
[738.98 --> 741.10]  So back to the drawing board on that one.
[741.26 --> 741.88]  Some water.
[742.10 --> 742.66]  Some water.
[743.60 --> 744.78]  That's actually not bad.
[745.62 --> 747.68]  You get the three little squirting water things, right?
[747.68 --> 747.82]  Yeah.
[747.92 --> 748.10]  Yeah.
[748.30 --> 748.94]  Oh, boy.
[749.02 --> 749.16]  Ooh.
[749.34 --> 749.54]  Oh, my.
[749.54 --> 750.32]  Oh, my.
[750.32 --> 750.60]  Ahem.
[751.72 --> 752.08]  Okay.
[752.26 --> 753.04]  But nervousness.
[753.10 --> 753.30]  Yeah.
[753.52 --> 753.84]  Yeah.
[754.04 --> 754.38]  Me too.
[754.60 --> 754.92]  Okay.
[755.08 --> 755.80]  Why are you nervous?
[756.12 --> 757.04]  I've got a few different things.
[757.12 --> 762.76]  One of them, hey, all that stuff we just talked about was set up last night and this morning.
[762.98 --> 763.86]  AJ went super ham.
[763.94 --> 764.68]  Thank you very much, AJ.
[765.16 --> 770.12]  But I'm going to be up on stage the entire time freaking out, hoping that everything isn't
[770.12 --> 770.62]  on fire.
[771.48 --> 774.00]  So that's going to be really great for the nerves.
[774.00 --> 782.48]  Number two is I've been off camera except for this and my own stream for a long time.
[782.64 --> 784.82]  And let alone presenting in front of people.
[784.82 --> 786.44]  There's going to be about 160 people there.
[786.78 --> 792.04]  And content that I've never even thought of doing before.
[792.04 --> 793.64]  I haven't done a full rehearsal of mine.
[793.64 --> 797.52]  I've said mine to...
[797.52 --> 800.20]  The bathroom mirror.
[800.40 --> 802.80]  Please tell me it was the bathroom mirror because that would be amazing.
[803.02 --> 804.10]  Two different people over Discord.
[804.36 --> 804.62]  Okay.
[804.78 --> 805.02]  All right.
[805.16 --> 805.36]  Yeah.
[805.36 --> 806.56]  That's it.
[806.82 --> 808.90]  But like, it's weird.
[809.22 --> 810.74]  I have not had time.
[811.54 --> 812.66]  I only...
[812.66 --> 816.52]  I mostly finished my material on, I think it was Tuesday night.
[816.94 --> 818.60]  It was either Tuesday or Wednesday night.
[818.78 --> 823.18]  And then I put the finishing touches on it this morning.
[823.54 --> 823.80]  Yeah.
[823.84 --> 826.00]  Which means doing a full read through.
[827.04 --> 828.54]  Not really even fully possible.
[828.56 --> 830.22]  I have not done.
[830.34 --> 831.52]  I've been shooting all day.
[831.64 --> 833.86]  That's the other weird part is this type of presenting.
[834.12 --> 835.02]  Oh, it's totally different.
[835.02 --> 837.52]  We've both done presenting, but we've never done presenting where people are going to
[837.52 --> 839.46]  like interrupt us by laughing or something.
[839.60 --> 839.74]  Yeah.
[839.84 --> 840.78]  I hope they laugh.
[840.78 --> 841.46]  If it's any good.
[841.66 --> 842.58]  I hope they laugh.
[842.60 --> 843.60]  That's been my biggest concern.
[843.70 --> 845.44]  It's like, I have no idea if this is even funny.
[845.58 --> 845.80]  It's funny.
[845.88 --> 847.54]  I was giving Yvonne a pep talk, right?
[847.58 --> 852.30]  So I was like, look, even if the people in the audience don't laugh, don't worry about
[852.30 --> 856.08]  it too much because you got to understand that only about half of the audience is actual
[856.08 --> 856.50]  fans.
[857.18 --> 857.42]  Okay.
[857.44 --> 860.34]  So I don't know if you know that, but Madrinas has a bunch of staff here.
[860.40 --> 860.76]  Okay.
[860.76 --> 864.50]  There's a bunch of our staff, friends and family of staff.
[864.50 --> 867.04]  Some people brought, like, I think James brought like six people.
[867.08 --> 868.50]  I'm trying to drag in a couple of friends.
[868.94 --> 873.52]  So like a lot of the people might not have all the context that they need to understand
[873.52 --> 874.74]  the joke, the ones there in person.
[875.06 --> 879.50]  And I was like, look, if, if we're going through the edit for YouTube and we think objectively
[879.50 --> 885.86]  that joke is very funny for our audience, we can, we might be able to play around with
[885.86 --> 887.88]  the laughter a little bit.
[887.96 --> 889.56]  Look, look, movie magic.
[889.72 --> 889.86]  Okay.
[890.20 --> 890.70]  Chill out.
[890.70 --> 896.22]  I was just, I was just saying, understand that there could be people out on the internet
[896.22 --> 900.56]  who think it's hilarious, but they're not there to laugh and feed you their energy.
[900.68 --> 901.60]  So just like, do your best.
[901.72 --> 902.80]  Is anyone going to be like watching the chat?
[902.92 --> 904.24]  Like you might be able to measure it that way.
[904.24 --> 905.26]  I have no idea.
[905.26 --> 905.78]  Okay.
[906.20 --> 911.28]  But like, even though I was like telling her that I'm sitting here with like knots in my
[911.28 --> 913.32]  stomach, unable to heed my own advice.
[913.32 --> 918.44]  And I'm like, I'm worried about bombing up there because I have never done anything like
[918.44 --> 918.80]  this.
[919.04 --> 920.14]  We're not comedy writers.
[920.38 --> 920.74]  No.
[921.44 --> 923.68]  I was never even a writer.
[924.56 --> 924.80]  No.
[926.52 --> 928.18]  You had to drag that out of me.
[928.24 --> 929.30]  Now I'm writing comedy.
[929.30 --> 930.48]  Like, I don't.
[931.50 --> 937.30]  And like, the thing is, I think of myself as kind of like a funny guy, you know, in a
[937.30 --> 937.74]  group of friends.
[937.74 --> 939.22]  But it's totally different humor.
[939.34 --> 940.96]  No, it's completely different.
[941.54 --> 947.32]  And the kind of like the punchiness and the cadence that you need to it is so different
[947.32 --> 949.96]  because I'm not trying to get any information across.
[950.56 --> 954.82]  I have no point other than like, you're mom dumb.
[954.82 --> 955.30]  Yeah.
[957.30 --> 958.68]  Apparently my material's great.
[959.30 --> 960.70]  I just need you.
[961.22 --> 962.16]  Yeah, I'll be open.
[962.16 --> 963.78]  You can laugh as loud as I'll need.
[963.86 --> 964.36]  I got you.
[964.52 --> 965.04]  No problem.
[965.18 --> 966.02]  I'll loudspeaker it.
[966.66 --> 969.86]  I, when I first heard about it, I was like, oh, I'm absolutely in.
[970.04 --> 970.60]  Of course.
[970.68 --> 971.44]  I need to be in on this.
[971.76 --> 974.20]  Then I heard, because I haven't really watched roast.
[974.40 --> 975.82]  Then I heard you get to roast us back.
[976.10 --> 976.72]  That sucks.
[977.16 --> 982.56]  And then I would like, had a whole bunch of like ideas in my head early on.
[982.56 --> 983.28]  I was like, oh, I'm fine.
[983.28 --> 984.98]  And then I wrote them all down and read them out loud.
[985.02 --> 987.18]  And I was like, this is garbage.
[987.80 --> 988.28]  I know.
[988.38 --> 989.12]  Holy crap.
[989.12 --> 991.04]  I had like, like my wife.
[991.04 --> 992.80]  I know her really, really well.
[992.92 --> 995.08]  I had like this much material for her.
[995.24 --> 997.22]  Just, just notes, bullet, bullet form.
[997.30 --> 1000.08]  I felt like I could have done a five minute set just on her.
[1000.78 --> 1005.68]  And then I started like fleshing it out into like, you know, like punch lines.
[1005.98 --> 1008.16]  And I was like, this isn't funny.
[1008.42 --> 1008.68]  No.
[1008.88 --> 1009.84]  It's just stupid.
[1009.84 --> 1010.88]  Yeah.
[1010.88 --> 1010.96]  Yeah.
[1010.96 --> 1011.48]  And so.
[1011.48 --> 1011.76]  And so.
[1011.76 --> 1016.82]  So this is where I'm worried where like, I don't necessarily know if I've gotten far enough
[1016.82 --> 1018.92]  away from the, this isn't funny.
[1019.02 --> 1019.90]  This is just stupid.
[1019.90 --> 1023.58]  I hope I made it.
[1023.58 --> 1024.54]  I have no idea.
[1024.54 --> 1031.44]  The thing too is like much, much, just like my career is making YouTube videos, which I
[1031.44 --> 1032.36]  don't really consume.
[1034.28 --> 1043.50]  Tonight I'm making roasts, like standup comedy content, which I actually don't find roasts
[1043.50 --> 1043.76]  funny.
[1043.76 --> 1048.56]  I watched some of like very famous roasts.
[1048.56 --> 1053.46]  Um, I watched some in preparation for this and the ones that I have watched so far, it
[1053.46 --> 1057.66]  seems to be people who like genuinely dislike each other for the most part.
[1058.02 --> 1059.88]  Or like I watched the Trump one.
[1059.90 --> 1061.46]  People who really, really deserve it.
[1061.90 --> 1063.44]  Like the Charlie Sheen one.
[1063.74 --> 1064.12]  Sure.
[1064.38 --> 1064.56]  Yeah.
[1064.76 --> 1069.70]  And it's like, and so I'm like, I'm watching, I'm watching this.
[1069.78 --> 1071.70]  I'm just going like, okay.
[1071.70 --> 1077.30]  Um, I mean, to be clear, I don't necessarily think it's people who genuinely dislike each
[1077.30 --> 1077.54]  other.
[1077.64 --> 1078.72]  I think maybe you're.
[1078.90 --> 1079.64]  No, the Trump one.
[1079.96 --> 1081.32]  Oh, I haven't watched the Trump one.
[1081.40 --> 1084.00]  The Trump one, as far as I can tell, is just a whole bunch of people who just viciously
[1084.00 --> 1084.50]  hate Trump.
[1084.60 --> 1087.86]  And I'm like, okay, I'm surprised he said okay to this.
[1088.40 --> 1092.26]  But like when you get like Seth MacFarlane up on stage, like doesn't like Trump.
[1092.28 --> 1093.06]  He's not a fan of.
[1093.12 --> 1093.38]  No.
[1093.54 --> 1094.42]  The Donald for sure.
[1094.48 --> 1098.18]  So, and then like I watched another one and I don't necessarily even know these people.
[1098.28 --> 1100.32]  I don't know famous people very well, as you know.
[1100.32 --> 1105.18]  So, there's a person who I forgot her name, Amy Schumer.
[1105.74 --> 1105.84]  Yeah.
[1105.94 --> 1106.00]  Yeah.
[1106.00 --> 1107.14]  And she's making fun of.
[1110.44 --> 1111.98]  I should really know this one.
[1112.18 --> 1112.68]  Mike Tyson.
[1113.26 --> 1114.02]  Oh, I see.
[1114.14 --> 1114.34]  Okay.
[1115.50 --> 1117.76]  And those are, those were brutal.
[1118.10 --> 1118.34]  Right.
[1118.36 --> 1120.58]  And they really don't seem to like each other at all.
[1120.62 --> 1120.64]  Yeah.
[1120.64 --> 1124.18]  I mean, Ann Coulter didn't think any of the stuff that got said about her was very funny.
[1124.66 --> 1125.00]  Yeah.
[1125.00 --> 1125.54]  Um.
[1125.78 --> 1129.36]  Like a fair amount of, I did watch, there was one with Jonah Hill in it.
[1129.46 --> 1131.94]  And it was like him and a few of his friends.
[1131.94 --> 1134.76]  And that one seemed like genuinely like they were just messing around.
[1134.80 --> 1135.50]  I was like, okay, that's cool.
[1135.62 --> 1136.88]  But that was the only example I found.
[1136.90 --> 1137.14]  Yeah.
[1137.20 --> 1137.64]  I don't know.
[1137.72 --> 1142.82]  It's just, but anyway, so I'm up there sort of, I have to sit there and try to appreciate
[1142.82 --> 1144.20]  this art form.
[1144.34 --> 1144.66]  Yeah.
[1144.66 --> 1149.62]  As the subject of it, when it's one that I don't really fully understand, like I don't
[1149.62 --> 1150.18]  really get.
[1150.90 --> 1152.90]  Um, and then I also have to do it.
[1153.60 --> 1161.32]  And, uh, I think both of us are going to have, um, challenges, but from opposite ends
[1161.32 --> 1163.62]  here in terms of like the creation of the material.
[1163.78 --> 1164.92]  So for, okay.
[1164.98 --> 1170.48]  So for those who don't know, members of the dais, um, are not just tasked with roasting
[1170.48 --> 1171.12]  me.
[1171.12 --> 1171.54]  Yeah.
[1171.54 --> 1177.76]  Um, anyone else up there is also fair game, but they still.
[1177.76 --> 1179.08]  I picked someone who's not even up there.
[1179.26 --> 1179.40]  Yeah.
[1179.40 --> 1183.84]  They still have to have a fair bit of material on me.
[1183.92 --> 1188.00]  And that's like, I'm not saying because I'm perfect or something.
[1188.00 --> 1192.74]  I'm just saying it's, it's hard to come up with really, really funny stuff.
[1192.74 --> 1194.96]  Like a lot of it for just one person.
[1194.96 --> 1197.32]  And I was told the vast majority is for you.
[1197.72 --> 1198.20]  Yes.
[1198.20 --> 1201.46]  And it's actually quite a while you have to talk for.
[1201.92 --> 1204.14]  So like, it's a lot of writing.
[1204.32 --> 1204.54]  Okay.
[1204.66 --> 1210.24]  So from the other side, I'm supposed to zing you all back, but I only get like five minutes,
[1210.32 --> 1210.80]  six minutes.
[1210.92 --> 1211.72]  Same as you guys.
[1211.92 --> 1212.06]  Yeah.
[1212.84 --> 1215.32]  So, so stringing it all together.
[1215.50 --> 1216.64]  I didn't even think about that.
[1216.64 --> 1218.74]  That was a huge challenge.
[1218.74 --> 1220.60]  I just expected you would murder me for like most of it.
[1221.10 --> 1222.08]  I was like, yeah, sure.
[1222.16 --> 1222.22]  Whatever.
[1222.22 --> 1223.42]  I'm supposed to hit everyone.
[1223.54 --> 1223.90]  And you know what?
[1223.92 --> 1224.52]  The funny thing is.
[1224.58 --> 1225.02]  That's kind of nuts.
[1225.02 --> 1229.10]  I accidentally wrote it with one person missing because there was actually a change.
[1229.32 --> 1229.54]  Yeah.
[1229.84 --> 1233.66]  Um, and what I realized was like, no, I can't leave it that way.
[1233.72 --> 1238.62]  You can't not zing one person because then that's weird.
[1238.86 --> 1239.10]  Yeah.
[1239.26 --> 1239.52]  Right.
[1239.82 --> 1240.08]  Yeah.
[1240.16 --> 1241.90]  And then people are like, why didn't you go after that guy?
[1242.00 --> 1242.30]  Yeah.
[1242.40 --> 1247.02]  Or they might feel like, does he think I'm such a snowflake that like, I can't take a joke
[1247.02 --> 1248.54]  or something like what's going on here?
[1248.54 --> 1253.20]  Like, like, it's almost like in order to prove that we are friends, you have to go.
[1253.22 --> 1255.78]  You have to rip on each other for something like this.
[1255.90 --> 1256.68]  I'm like, yeah.
[1257.82 --> 1259.96]  And it's like, how savage do I get?
[1260.02 --> 1264.30]  Because I'm in a, I'm in kind of a weird position too, where unlike most roasts, I'm in
[1264.30 --> 1269.88]  a position of power and or authority over at least half of the people up there.
[1270.12 --> 1270.34]  Yeah.
[1270.64 --> 1275.98]  Um, that's another weird spot is I've never seen one where it's like their boss.
[1276.12 --> 1276.42]  Yeah.
[1278.20 --> 1281.14]  I'm really looking forward to it and I want them to not hold back.
[1281.24 --> 1285.22]  I've had people approach me and be like, look, I've got something really, really mean.
[1285.34 --> 1286.36]  I think you'll cry.
[1287.14 --> 1288.78]  And I'm like, do it.
[1289.20 --> 1290.24]  Like, do it, do it.
[1290.28 --> 1291.02]  Don't hold back.
[1291.02 --> 1296.32]  But the thing is like, I couldn't make like the kinds of mean jokes that I could make about
[1296.32 --> 1300.14]  people like, yeah, you know, your job performance last year was pretty crap.
[1300.24 --> 1301.42]  That's why you didn't get a raise.
[1302.50 --> 1303.90]  Like, that's not funny.
[1304.10 --> 1304.32]  Yeah.
[1304.52 --> 1305.32]  That's not appropriate.
[1305.52 --> 1311.22]  So I had to figure out like what, like, it's almost like it puts more restrictions on me
[1311.22 --> 1316.78]  than it does on them because I need to make sure that I'm, I need to dish it back because
[1316.78 --> 1321.16]  otherwise I'm not playing the game properly, but with restrictions.
[1321.34 --> 1324.60]  Whereas with them, I, I, it's full, full open fire.
[1324.74 --> 1327.14]  You know, there were things that I took out of your section.
[1328.26 --> 1332.82]  Um, there's also things that I took out of other people's sections just because honestly,
[1332.94 --> 1338.46]  it, a lot of it came down to like, not only do I think that thing wasn't necessarily as
[1338.46 --> 1341.96]  funny because almost every time it wasn't as funny, which is one of the reasons why I got cut,
[1341.96 --> 1347.62]  but like, it's either not applicable as much as the other things, or it's like probably
[1347.62 --> 1348.78]  a little too private.
[1349.76 --> 1353.00]  I went for much more public things on everything.
[1353.66 --> 1355.44]  Um, and tried to focus on that kind of stuff.
[1355.44 --> 1356.40]  Some people were really tough.
[1356.58 --> 1360.64]  Um, actually I forgot one of the Deus members is going to be my old boss.
[1360.64 --> 1361.10]  Oh yeah.
[1361.52 --> 1364.00]  And so he doesn't have much of a public profile.
[1364.20 --> 1365.94]  So it's not like I can make jokes.
[1366.04 --> 1370.08]  Like, remember the time he, no, not, no, we don't.
[1370.08 --> 1370.56]  Uh-huh.
[1371.70 --> 1372.10]  Hooray.
[1373.02 --> 1378.76]  Um, so, so even though I have to do eight or nine people or whatever it is in five or
[1378.76 --> 1384.66]  six minutes, I also have to kind of like put some context behind what I'm saying or
[1384.66 --> 1385.82]  like come up with stuff.
[1385.84 --> 1388.56]  I actually have a really good, I have a really good set for him though.
[1389.16 --> 1389.56]  Yeah.
[1389.56 --> 1390.40]  I'm actually really happy.
[1390.40 --> 1393.36]  I was, when I saw his name, I was like, Linus needs to go hard.
[1393.52 --> 1397.86]  Cause like, I don't have that much time for it, but like, yeah.
[1397.86 --> 1398.14]  Yeah.
[1399.26 --> 1400.84]  It's going to be, it's going to be really interesting.
[1401.36 --> 1405.22]  Uh, seven says, is there a float plane blog?
[1405.42 --> 1407.72]  Because it's hard to keep track of what's going on.
[1408.12 --> 1414.14]  I've, I've wanted to start one a number of times, but what's happened every time and
[1414.14 --> 1415.90]  it's, it's starting to change now, especially.
[1415.90 --> 1417.66]  So maybe I will start one soon.
[1417.78 --> 1418.28]  I'm not sure.
[1418.28 --> 1419.66]  I've asked him to do this a lot of times.
[1419.66 --> 1420.10]  It has.
[1420.20 --> 1422.30]  I even said on Wancho once I was going to do one soon.
[1422.38 --> 1423.22]  That was a long time ago.
[1423.22 --> 1427.50]  The problem is we'll start working and we're growing in employees.
[1427.50 --> 1430.70]  So it's starting to become less of a problem as people are starting to work on things more
[1430.70 --> 1431.30]  parallelized.
[1431.42 --> 1435.98]  But like, I think I said I was going to do one of those blogs right before we went into,
[1436.68 --> 1437.86]  that's a lot of rain.
[1438.04 --> 1442.56]  Right before we went into something that, uh, we just refer to as like the V1 push, which
[1442.56 --> 1445.06]  is our, our framework went from beta to version one.
[1445.06 --> 1450.76]  So we had to spend months just updating everything to work with version one.
[1450.76 --> 1452.82]  Is that interesting in a blog?
[1453.70 --> 1454.12]  Nope.
[1454.80 --> 1455.54]  Not at all.
[1455.86 --> 1456.34]  I don't know.
[1456.46 --> 1458.92]  I think for some of our audience members, it actually would be.
[1459.24 --> 1463.46]  I, oh, I don't, I don't think that section, I don't, that section wasn't even interesting
[1463.46 --> 1465.68]  for our own team, let alone other people.
[1465.88 --> 1467.50]  That just, that time just sucked.
[1467.98 --> 1471.66]  Uh, we're in, we're in good time now, which is cool.
[1471.88 --> 1473.88]  Uh, so a bunch of things are, are happening.
[1474.40 --> 1478.80]  Um, it's Tyler just like teleported from over there to over there, as far as I can tell.
[1478.80 --> 1482.04]  Um, so it'd probably be more interesting now.
[1482.16 --> 1485.74]  And now I'm, I have like a little bit more incentive to do it, but now that things are
[1485.74 --> 1491.38]  more interesting, I also have less time because now I'm trying to hire more people and stuff.
[1491.98 --> 1492.72]  I don't know.
[1493.12 --> 1498.08]  But yeah, maybe, maybe after I'm done hiring people, I'll, I'll make another attempt at
[1498.08 --> 1498.82]  making the blog.
[1498.96 --> 1504.46]  I also want it to like, I think it would make more sense to, for it to be on the website.
[1504.46 --> 1504.50]  Right.
[1505.06 --> 1508.48]  And then that would require time from the dev team to go do that.
[1508.54 --> 1510.66]  And there's other like hyper high priority things.
[1510.78 --> 1512.28]  I think on Facebook would be fine, honestly.
[1513.22 --> 1514.38]  Yeah, I could probably just do that.
[1514.38 --> 1514.54]  Yeah.
[1515.26 --> 1516.00]  We have a Facebook.
[1516.58 --> 1518.02]  Every once in a while, I'll get an email.
[1518.76 --> 1519.86]  Hey, why don't you do anything?
[1519.86 --> 1521.64]  Hey, you should interact with people.
[1523.78 --> 1524.58]  Uh, maybe.
[1524.82 --> 1525.72]  Yeah, probably should.
[1526.50 --> 1531.24]  I just, we, we've been in, in such a pre-release state, um, that it's felt.
[1531.24 --> 1536.22]  You know what, I, what, you know what, honestly, the thing that I don't like about it is that
[1536.22 --> 1538.12]  we're losing so much of our like history.
[1538.70 --> 1540.52]  One of the really cool things about-
[1540.52 --> 1541.82]  No, I've got, I've got it all.
[1541.98 --> 1542.34]  You do?
[1542.54 --> 1542.74]  Yeah.
[1542.82 --> 1543.10]  Okay.
[1543.42 --> 1543.80]  Well, I don't get to see it.
[1543.80 --> 1547.00]  Just like I still have screenshots from the original version of the forum.
[1547.38 --> 1547.74]  Okay.
[1547.82 --> 1550.34]  I've got screenshots and videos all the way through.
[1550.50 --> 1550.80]  Okay.
[1550.98 --> 1554.66]  And I can maybe even do like, look where we came from posts.
[1554.66 --> 1557.72]  Yeah, but the feeling will be like missing a little bit, I think.
[1557.72 --> 1564.30]  Like it won't be, you won't be like, everything is retrospective instead of like, yeah, that
[1564.30 --> 1567.10]  was where my head was at, at that point in the journey.
[1567.32 --> 1571.56]  Whereas what's really cool about Linus Media Group is that because we create videos every
[1571.56 --> 1571.90]  day.
[1572.00 --> 1572.20]  Yeah.
[1573.18 --> 1574.92]  It's like, it's like a memory trigger.
[1575.08 --> 1578.58]  I just, I think part of the problem is like, I don't want to star citizen ourselves.
[1579.04 --> 1579.44]  Yeah.
[1580.08 --> 1581.10]  Cause like I-
[1581.10 --> 1582.48]  And become a blog company, basically.
[1583.30 --> 1583.62]  Partially.
[1583.62 --> 1583.70]  Partially.
[1583.76 --> 1588.52]  And I don't want to, I don't want to pay for the fact that like I said, hey, the app's
[1588.52 --> 1588.90]  almost ready.
[1589.00 --> 1590.04]  We're going to open source it soon.
[1590.20 --> 1593.74]  And then like our path changed a little bit internally.
[1594.00 --> 1594.18]  Yeah.
[1594.28 --> 1595.48]  And like, hey, I'm going to do a blog.
[1595.52 --> 1596.50]  And then we start doing V1.
[1596.54 --> 1598.02]  And I'm like, that doesn't really make sense anymore.
[1598.26 --> 1600.46]  But now I'm accountable for those things.
[1600.70 --> 1603.78]  Everything we put up in a dev blog, we're accountable for.
[1604.10 --> 1604.34]  Right.
[1604.34 --> 1608.00]  So if I'm like, hey, we're starting work on X project.
[1608.82 --> 1610.52]  And then X project gets partway through.
[1611.46 --> 1617.04]  And then the person working on it is like, hey, this other thing should probably be done
[1617.04 --> 1617.50]  immediately.
[1617.50 --> 1618.92]  I'm going to shift priority to that.
[1618.92 --> 1624.78]  And we drop X project for, I don't know, six months, most of a year, forever.
[1625.90 --> 1626.72]  Who knows?
[1626.98 --> 1627.70]  Things change.
[1628.40 --> 1630.48]  I do think that's pretty typical of a dev blog though.
[1631.12 --> 1631.60]  Yeah.
[1631.60 --> 1632.98]  But people get angry about it.
[1633.38 --> 1634.58]  That's very true.
[1634.66 --> 1637.10]  And I just, I don't know if I want to deal with that.
[1641.02 --> 1642.68]  Give in to your anger.
[1643.84 --> 1644.08]  Yeah.
[1644.98 --> 1645.74]  Oh, that's weird.
[1646.62 --> 1648.14]  Shouldn't there be an admin CP there?
[1650.40 --> 1651.84]  You might not be a thingy.
[1651.98 --> 1652.88]  What did I do?
[1653.00 --> 1654.04]  You're in the wrong account, bro.
[1655.06 --> 1655.46]  Okay.
[1656.20 --> 1658.40]  Well, I will deal with it another time.
[1658.58 --> 1659.46]  Because that's the other account.
[1659.62 --> 1659.76]  Yeah.
[1659.86 --> 1660.06]  No.
[1660.16 --> 1661.42]  Do you want that other account?
[1661.42 --> 1667.12]  Oh, I was just, there's so many people in the float plane chat saying that there are like brand new subscribers and they're here for the roast.
[1667.28 --> 1670.86]  And I just, I was just curious to see how many people were joining.
[1671.60 --> 1674.98]  You know what we should really do is go through our sponsors for the show today.
[1675.16 --> 1677.64]  So first up, we've got.
[1677.86 --> 1678.14]  Oh, wow.
[1678.20 --> 1678.60]  Yeah, they should.
[1678.70 --> 1679.02]  That's weird.
[1679.20 --> 1679.66]  You know what?
[1679.70 --> 1681.40]  No, let's do our first tech topic first.
[1681.80 --> 1682.08]  Okay.
[1682.08 --> 1683.10]  And then we will do that.
[1683.10 --> 1688.12]  So Intel, getting real serious about consumer graphics.
[1688.12 --> 1688.36]  Very.
[1688.36 --> 1688.80]  Looks like.
[1688.80 --> 1692.40]  So they recently, this was posted by Deus Voltage on the forum.
[1692.96 --> 1696.12]  And the article that we found it on.
[1696.12 --> 1696.72]  I like that name.
[1698.22 --> 1698.98]  Was Kit Guru.
[1699.22 --> 1701.68]  NVIDIA's Tom Peterson reportedly joins Intel.
[1701.80 --> 1703.06]  Well, since five days ago.
[1703.32 --> 1703.74]  Inside.
[1703.74 --> 1708.16]  That rumor or report has been very much confirmed.
[1708.66 --> 1715.38]  Tom Tap Peterson is officially at Intel, which for me was like.
[1717.52 --> 1718.12]  What?
[1718.84 --> 1721.80]  You can ask Jaden and everyone around me upstairs.
[1721.80 --> 1723.78]  When I read this news, I did the same thing.
[1723.78 --> 1731.42]  Like, I thought if you cut the guy open, his blood was like bright green.
[1731.42 --> 1733.68]  Like, I was saving this.
[1734.02 --> 1737.54]  It was so hard for me to not go off about this because I wanted to save it for WAN show.
[1737.70 --> 1740.62]  And then I forgot about it when we were sitting here before the show.
[1740.66 --> 1742.46]  And I'm so happy because I wouldn't have been able to contain myself.
[1742.88 --> 1751.08]  Do you think it might be somewhat, maybe marginally related to the hashtag save Tom situation?
[1753.10 --> 1754.60]  I think that couldn't help.
[1754.60 --> 1765.74]  So, for those of you who don't know, during a keynote, Jensen basically publicly humiliated Tom when a demo wasn't going according to plan.
[1766.40 --> 1775.52]  And the sort of word on the street is that Jensen is an extremely difficult boss to work for.
[1775.52 --> 1785.00]  Not in the way that some bosses might be hard to work for, where they come in and like berate you for being stupid because you suck at your job, but they're like an idiot.
[1785.38 --> 1793.26]  Where he'll come in and berate you for being stupid and sucking at your job, leaning over, spending three minutes and doing it better than you did.
[1793.90 --> 1795.42]  I mean, like, that's how it's done.
[1795.56 --> 1798.88]  Because the guy is apparently just an absolute genius.
[1798.88 --> 1807.94]  It's just that it doesn't make it easier to deal with them, necessarily.
[1808.22 --> 1814.04]  And this is all, I'm not, I can't, I could never name, I couldn't even name a source because I don't remember where I've heard it from.
[1814.16 --> 1817.82]  But multiple people have expressed this sentiment to me over time.
[1817.90 --> 1818.96]  Yes, we know we have to leave at six.
[1819.02 --> 1820.06]  Oh, no, I was just going to run through.
[1820.40 --> 1821.58]  Oh, thanks, Ed.
[1821.58 --> 1831.10]  Anyway, so I think what we were seeing there might have just been a more public example of something that just exists.
[1831.46 --> 1831.58]  Yeah.
[1832.56 --> 1834.58]  With that said, I mean, Tom...
[1835.12 --> 1841.14]  But like, my experience with that was that Tom effectively disappeared after that for like a while.
[1841.30 --> 1841.98]  I tried to...
[1841.98 --> 1842.62]  Stuff like social media.
[1842.74 --> 1846.70]  No, I tried to get on a call with him at one point and didn't.
[1846.84 --> 1847.80]  He was like gone.
[1847.98 --> 1848.14]  Yeah.
[1848.54 --> 1848.68]  Yeah.
[1848.68 --> 1853.44]  Well, he wasn't gone, but like, there had to be a very good reason to talk to him or something.
[1853.64 --> 1856.64]  And I was like, can I just talk to Tom about this?
[1856.66 --> 1858.04]  Because I wanted something explained to me.
[1858.12 --> 1863.64]  And quite frankly, nobody explains really complex technology like Tom Peterson.
[1863.66 --> 1864.12]  He's amazing.
[1864.34 --> 1864.48]  Yeah.
[1864.62 --> 1873.18]  The thing is that aside from having a great personality and having a talent for dumbing things down, he really, really understands it.
[1873.18 --> 1889.70]  And by really understands it, I mean, again, can't tell you where I heard this, but word on the street is the guy basically invented G-Sync and pretty much created the API that we use for NVIDIA overclocking that utilities like MSI Afterburner and EVGA Precision hook into.
[1889.70 --> 1891.68]  Like the guy's important.
[1891.86 --> 1892.50]  He knows gaming.
[1892.50 --> 1893.16]  Really big deal.
[1893.18 --> 1894.36]  He knows graphics cards.
[1895.92 --> 1898.12]  And he's on Team Blue.
[1898.62 --> 1899.02]  Wow.
[1899.02 --> 1905.58]  Now, to be clear, a GPU like Turing, for example, is not the brainchild of one person.
[1905.68 --> 1906.52]  It doesn't work that way.
[1906.56 --> 1907.16]  Not even close.
[1907.16 --> 1910.50]  And it's not like NVIDIA is going to be like, oh, no.
[1910.98 --> 1914.32]  However, will we make another graphics card without Tom?
[1915.34 --> 1916.78]  There's a lot of smart people there.
[1917.28 --> 1924.44]  It's just that this one is one that I would have thought they would have worked pretty hard to hold on to.
[1924.50 --> 1929.00]  Then again, I might have said the same thing about Roger Kuduri, who defected from AMD over to Intel.
[1929.54 --> 1931.34]  I think it was last year.
[1931.34 --> 1944.92]  I was joking around with some guys upstairs about how we should start doing fantasy team stuff for GPU companies just to try to guesstimate who Intel is going to hire next.
[1945.98 --> 1947.60]  Because apparently that's what they're doing.
[1947.76 --> 1949.84]  They're just taking everyone that's like...
[1949.84 --> 1950.66]  Well, they hired Kyle Bennett.
[1950.66 --> 1951.28]  Yeah.
[1956.74 --> 1957.26]  Anyways.
[1961.34 --> 1967.54]  He'll be in charge of outreach to gamers and enthusiasts.
[1970.94 --> 1975.46]  I just don't know about if that's a good idea or not.
[1976.12 --> 1977.34]  I looked into...
[1978.00 --> 1982.16]  I was trying to talk to someone that I'm not going to name about that one.
[1982.50 --> 1989.64]  And I was like, I'm just surprised because of some of the stuff that he says and they want him for outreach.
[1989.64 --> 1992.22]  And then I googled some threads with him included.
[1992.36 --> 1994.66]  And I was like, wow, yep, I'm really surprised.
[1995.26 --> 1997.70]  That was an interesting move.
[1998.38 --> 1999.14]  I don't know.
[2000.70 --> 2001.14]  Anyways.
[2001.34 --> 2008.96]  One thing that I think is going to be pretty interesting is a lot of the communication from Intel has been extremely gamer focused.
[2008.96 --> 2014.96]  And it feels like that's their focus for their GPUs.
[2015.12 --> 2019.62]  And over the last little while, it feels like NVIDIA's focus for the GPUs is not gaming.
[2020.06 --> 2021.02]  It's data center.
[2021.30 --> 2023.08]  It's AI and stuff like that.
[2023.24 --> 2023.82]  Deep learning.
[2024.12 --> 2024.46]  Deep learning.
[2024.76 --> 2024.82]  Cars.
[2025.20 --> 2025.78]  All that kind of thing.
[2025.96 --> 2026.10]  Yeah.
[2026.38 --> 2026.58]  Yeah.
[2027.70 --> 2028.18]  Yeah.
[2028.52 --> 2032.48]  I'm absolutely fascinated to see how this plays out.
[2032.48 --> 2039.92]  And I wonder what AMD's place in the world is going to be when it's Intel going head to head with NVIDIA on graphics.
[2040.52 --> 2042.76]  On the graphics side of things, I don't know, man.
[2043.42 --> 2046.16]  But on the CPU side of things, they still seem to be doing pretty good.
[2046.26 --> 2053.20]  Speaking of things I don't know, I don't know how I haven't managed to tell you guys about our sponsors for the WAN show yet.
[2053.36 --> 2053.72]  There you go.
[2053.84 --> 2057.72]  Our first sponsor is Savage Jerky.
[2058.38 --> 2059.60]  Is there jerky to eat?
[2060.94 --> 2061.94]  Savage Jerky.
[2061.94 --> 2065.36]  I'm not even hungry today, but I want my maple buffalo bacon.
[2065.50 --> 2066.24]  I am so hungry.
[2066.36 --> 2067.52]  I've had basically no food.
[2067.92 --> 2068.16]  Okay.
[2068.22 --> 2069.62]  Well, you can pick what you want of that.
[2070.00 --> 2071.26]  I'm having maple buffalo bacon.
[2071.80 --> 2072.92]  I'm just going to have some original.
[2073.46 --> 2073.88]  Nice.
[2074.72 --> 2075.60]  Savage Jerky.
[2075.80 --> 2080.86]  Their goal is to create a snack that's full of flavor and spice, but that isn't bad for you.
[2081.18 --> 2086.20]  Their jerky is made without nitrates or preservatives, and they've got 13 different flavors of jerky to choose from,
[2086.52 --> 2088.70]  like sriracha bacon and maple buffalo bacon.
[2088.70 --> 2093.04]  They also make barbecue sauce, hot sauce, and a spice rub.
[2093.38 --> 2097.38]  And their Carolina Reaper hot sauce uses one of the hottest peppers in the world.
[2098.68 --> 2099.80]  The Carolina Reaper.
[2099.80 --> 2105.54]  So use offer code LTT to save 15% on all of their products at the link below.
[2106.96 --> 2109.48]  Also sponsoring the show today, Displate is back.
[2109.54 --> 2110.66]  Hey, cool.
[2111.52 --> 2116.24]  Apparently, people on WAN show were pretty into these.
[2116.24 --> 2122.06]  So they've got over 26, 200, excuse me, 260.
[2122.56 --> 2123.70]  Wait, you weren't here for this.
[2123.82 --> 2123.94]  No.
[2124.08 --> 2124.74]  Oh, these are cool.
[2124.92 --> 2125.52]  I've never seen this.
[2125.54 --> 2127.96]  They've got over 260,000 designs.
[2128.12 --> 2130.84]  They do prints on a magnet-mounted metal sheet.
[2131.84 --> 2133.04]  So you can, like, swap them out.
[2133.60 --> 2133.96]  Exactly.
[2134.16 --> 2134.76]  That's really cool.
[2134.86 --> 2136.90]  So you can't have something, like, crooked on your wall.
[2136.90 --> 2137.06]  Yeah.
[2137.10 --> 2139.18]  You just, yeah, and it sticks there.
[2139.82 --> 2141.42]  And so they're durable.
[2141.54 --> 2143.04]  You don't need any power tools to hang it.
[2143.22 --> 2147.58]  You can just easily and quickly swap them out if you're into something else or whatever.
[2147.82 --> 2148.48]  And this is cool.
[2148.54 --> 2151.54]  They plant 10 trees for every Displate that gets purchased.
[2151.54 --> 2157.94]  So use code LTT to save 15% at lmd.gg slash Displate WAN.
[2158.44 --> 2163.40]  Apparently, after the last WAN show spot we did, our audience was pretty into these.
[2164.14 --> 2167.24]  Like, I'm talking a lot of Displates.
[2167.92 --> 2169.84]  So I was like, oh, yeah, neat.
[2170.18 --> 2172.08]  And we were using them in the sets already.
[2172.58 --> 2172.80]  Yeah.
[2172.90 --> 2174.46]  Because if we want to change up the look really quickly.
[2174.46 --> 2175.06]  It's really easy.
[2175.30 --> 2176.38]  Clang, clang, done.
[2176.50 --> 2177.14]  That's super cool.
[2177.20 --> 2177.88]  Yeah, really cool.
[2178.96 --> 2179.94]  Yeah, I've genuinely never seen that.
[2179.94 --> 2180.66]  Oh, yeah, check this one out.
[2180.66 --> 2181.14]  Ah!
[2182.44 --> 2182.80]  Ah!
[2184.46 --> 2186.64]  Here's another really neat, like, kind of techy-looking design.
[2186.90 --> 2187.46]  I like that.
[2187.74 --> 2187.86]  Yeah.
[2187.86 --> 2189.82]  I like both of them so far, but I think I like this one more.
[2190.82 --> 2192.06]  I just like the art style.
[2193.28 --> 2197.96]  And finally, the WAN show is brought to you by Madrinas.
[2200.16 --> 2201.26]  Oh, are these them?
[2201.38 --> 2202.10]  Yeah, these are them!
[2203.38 --> 2204.26]  Don't take them out.
[2204.36 --> 2204.96]  Don't take them out?
[2205.00 --> 2205.28]  Why not?
[2205.30 --> 2205.72]  Okay, fine.
[2206.04 --> 2207.40]  There's none behind them.
[2207.40 --> 2208.62]  I know there's none behind them.
[2208.64 --> 2209.02]  It's fine.
[2209.02 --> 2212.72]  So we do have more, but we kind of took them all because we're bringing them to the roast.
[2212.72 --> 2212.94]  Yep.
[2213.54 --> 2221.02]  So these are the exclusive Linus Tech Tips vanilla cold brew cans, and they are coming
[2221.02 --> 2221.30]  soon.
[2221.36 --> 2222.56]  These are prototypes, by the way.
[2222.86 --> 2224.68]  And by prototypes, they mean stickers.
[2225.36 --> 2225.74]  Yeah.
[2225.74 --> 2226.88]  They're just stickers.
[2227.00 --> 2228.06]  It looks pretty good for a sticker.
[2228.12 --> 2229.30]  I had no idea until you pulled it out.
[2229.74 --> 2231.64]  Madrinas Coffee is coffee for fuel.
[2231.78 --> 2236.02]  Organic cold brew coffee in a convenient 15-ounce can with a flavor for everyone.
[2236.16 --> 2240.68]  Madrinas Coffee offers sweet and creamy flavors like mocha or caramel, or bold flavors
[2240.68 --> 2242.12]  like their cold brew black.
[2242.62 --> 2246.10]  LTT has a permanent item on their e-store, the Lambo Roast.
[2246.16 --> 2247.18]  You guys should check that out.
[2247.18 --> 2251.70]  And if you head over to madrinascoffee.com slash Linus, you can get 40% off your entire
[2251.70 --> 2253.76]  order with offer code Linus.
[2253.92 --> 2257.88]  If you have any questions about Madrinas or cold brew coffee or micro roast or anything,
[2258.24 --> 2261.62]  Shlomo from the Madrinas Coffee Head team is in the chat ready to answer your questions
[2261.62 --> 2262.90]  through direct messages.
[2264.44 --> 2265.68]  I have a note in here.
[2265.80 --> 2270.32]  Don't forget to tease slash mention the roast of Linus Sebastian tonight.
[2270.48 --> 2271.38]  I think we spent...
[2271.38 --> 2273.16]  I think we got that covered.
[2273.48 --> 2274.54]  I think we did that for a while.
[2275.28 --> 2276.00]  I think we're good.
[2276.00 --> 2276.82]  I think that's no problem.
[2278.74 --> 2280.38]  I'm so freaking nervous.
[2280.74 --> 2281.22]  Yeah, me too.
[2281.26 --> 2284.94]  The closer I get to it, the more I'm just like seizing out.
[2284.94 --> 2285.94]  I'm trying to not...
[2286.94 --> 2287.66]  I don't know.
[2287.78 --> 2290.38]  I go through sections where I'm like, I'm just going to try to not think about it.
[2290.40 --> 2292.50]  I'm going to do some other stuff to take my mind off it.
[2292.64 --> 2297.16]  But then I'm like, I should be practicing or reading or like doing something.
[2297.54 --> 2299.80]  I know so little about what's going to happen.
[2300.12 --> 2300.30]  Yeah.
[2300.60 --> 2302.24]  All I know is little bits and pieces.
[2302.24 --> 2308.80]  I know that apparently half-naked butlers are going to carry me in on a litter.
[2311.50 --> 2311.82]  What?
[2312.18 --> 2312.44]  Yeah.
[2312.50 --> 2315.44]  That's how I make my approach to the stage apparently.
[2315.54 --> 2315.80]  What?
[2315.96 --> 2316.38]  I know.
[2316.50 --> 2317.32]  Who are these people?
[2317.42 --> 2317.84]  This is like...
[2317.84 --> 2318.64]  No, it's like a thing.
[2319.22 --> 2319.66]  What?
[2319.74 --> 2319.86]  Yeah.
[2319.90 --> 2322.08]  There's like a service that has like...
[2322.08 --> 2322.46]  What?
[2323.46 --> 2324.58]  You can hire butlers.
[2326.02 --> 2328.06]  That 100% must have been James.
[2328.20 --> 2328.70]  Oh yeah, of course.
[2328.78 --> 2330.08]  I'm sure no one else was...
[2330.08 --> 2330.78]  No, of course not.
[2331.16 --> 2331.34]  Yeah.
[2331.88 --> 2334.84]  So anyway, so like I've heard these little...
[2334.84 --> 2335.24]  Boy!
[2335.88 --> 2338.48]  Bits and pieces of what's going to happen tonight.
[2338.68 --> 2343.90]  But this is probably the least involved that I have ever been in a major project at this company.
[2344.14 --> 2344.42]  Yeah.
[2344.42 --> 2349.68]  Because out of necessity, I cannot know exactly what's going on.
[2349.92 --> 2351.42]  Are you worried about...
[2352.02 --> 2357.80]  Because we talked about your worries and one of them was a complication of you don't have really enough time per person.
[2358.48 --> 2360.66]  Are you worried about how...
[2360.66 --> 2365.24]  I'm not going to ask for specific names or anything, but are you worried about how people will take your roasts at all?
[2366.10 --> 2369.42]  Or are you worried about the presentation and...
[2369.42 --> 2371.78]  Because I know you're worried about the writing because it's something you haven't really done.
[2371.78 --> 2373.68]  I'm not worried about people taking it badly.
[2373.90 --> 2374.10]  Okay.
[2374.10 --> 2376.10]  I'm mostly worried about...
[2376.82 --> 2378.36]  I just don't want to be in the bottom half.
[2379.22 --> 2380.14]  The bottom half?
[2380.22 --> 2380.36]  Yeah.
[2381.32 --> 2384.12]  Of everyone's sets, I don't want to be the best.
[2384.32 --> 2386.16]  I don't expect to be the star of the show or whatever.
[2386.64 --> 2388.24]  I just don't want to be the worst.
[2388.50 --> 2389.02]  Me too.
[2389.40 --> 2389.52]  Yeah.
[2389.58 --> 2390.10]  That's like...
[2391.20 --> 2396.70]  You don't want to be that one person at the roast that sucked.
[2396.92 --> 2397.16]  Yeah.
[2398.58 --> 2400.48]  I'm genuinely worried about mine in that regard.
[2400.48 --> 2401.82]  I think I'll do okay.
[2401.82 --> 2408.32]  My problem is I've tested on people so far and they've all been like, yeah, that's super great.
[2408.54 --> 2408.58]  Funny.
[2408.70 --> 2410.04]  But it's like, my friends?
[2413.04 --> 2413.52]  So...
[2413.52 --> 2415.92]  And the other thing you can't control too...
[2415.92 --> 2417.74]  I think like, no, I don't have time to edit it.
[2417.74 --> 2418.74]  It's like, what you...
[2418.74 --> 2430.70]  The other thing that's like, really scary too is that like, what if you come on after someone that bombed?
[2431.24 --> 2434.52]  What if it's not your fault that the audience is half asleep?
[2435.10 --> 2435.34]  Yeah.
[2435.34 --> 2437.62]  Like, what if, what if, what if, what if?
[2438.04 --> 2450.80]  What if by the time I get up, because I go last, what if by the time I get up there, the whole show is such a complete snore fest that like only the friends and family are left?
[2452.02 --> 2452.76]  What if?
[2453.12 --> 2453.82]  I don't know.
[2453.82 --> 2459.68]  And like, actually a pretty significant amount of people that I've talked to don't enjoy roasts.
[2460.16 --> 2461.78]  I didn't know you didn't either.
[2462.32 --> 2465.66]  But like, what if the audience just isn't into it?
[2468.16 --> 2469.00]  It's interesting.
[2469.44 --> 2472.32]  It's something, it's aggressively something we've never done before.
[2472.32 --> 2472.82]  Mm-hmm.
[2474.94 --> 2477.10]  Patchou actually gave a review of the Lambo roast.
[2478.50 --> 2480.78]  Good quality, non-exciting blend.
[2481.32 --> 2485.02]  Happy for the quality, but I've had a Phil's kick and that's miles more interesting.
[2485.18 --> 2492.44]  Wish they did something more dramatic to turn heads and anger certain people with the Lambo roast than hit something that's kind of for everyone and that's boring.
[2493.90 --> 2496.30]  Honestly, I will tell you that was my directive.
[2496.44 --> 2500.16]  I was going to say, I think they let you guys kind of design it.
[2500.16 --> 2502.30]  We designed it by consensus internally.
[2502.54 --> 2502.64]  Yeah.
[2502.82 --> 2510.24]  So we went with what everyone, every coffee drinker in the building liked rather than something that was very polarizing.
[2510.68 --> 2511.70]  That makes sense.
[2511.94 --> 2515.50]  So heck yeah, I guess, because it went pretty much right with what he said.
[2515.60 --> 2518.82]  So Linus Tech Tips merch has kind of a new directive now.
[2519.48 --> 2530.92]  It honestly doesn't matter, like kind of how much margin we make on it or if it's necessarily the most sensible thing to bring down the roadmap at this time or whatever.
[2530.92 --> 2538.78]  The thing is, any LTT merch moving forward because I was really unhappy with some of the old stuff just needs to be good.
[2538.84 --> 2542.76]  You need to get it and you need to feel like, oh, they cared.
[2543.44 --> 2543.52]  Yeah.
[2543.52 --> 2545.08]  They cared enough that this is good.
[2545.74 --> 2553.86]  So I'm fine if it's a little bland, but I would be really upset if the quality of it was not acceptable.
[2554.08 --> 2554.24]  Yeah.
[2554.24 --> 2556.54]  So that was basically that.
[2556.72 --> 2557.02]  I'm just.
[2558.08 --> 2562.38]  Before getting on the show, I had this bin delivered to me with my name on it with shirts.
[2562.46 --> 2567.60]  So I can't possibly forget things because everyone knows I'm pretty bad at remembering that kind of stuff, which is great.
[2567.68 --> 2568.38]  Thank you, Lloyd.
[2568.38 --> 2574.58]  But I put the shirt on and immediately before the show, even I was like, wow, it feels really nice.
[2574.70 --> 2574.88]  Yes.
[2575.08 --> 2576.64]  Like the shirts are just better.
[2576.76 --> 2578.84]  The design's not out there or anything.
[2579.16 --> 2579.38]  Not necessarily.
[2579.38 --> 2579.92]  This is a really.
[2580.06 --> 2580.32]  The logo.
[2580.48 --> 2581.64]  This is a really simple dessert.
[2581.86 --> 2582.26]  Dessert.
[2582.38 --> 2585.08]  This is a really simple shirt that we'd like anyone to kind of.
[2585.14 --> 2585.70]  Quite complicated.
[2585.70 --> 2591.82]  Feel like they're not, you know, shilling for Linus Media Group by wearing it.
[2591.82 --> 2597.66]  They just it's just I just want to see like a nice shirt that's comfortable and that they they like to wear.
[2598.96 --> 2603.22]  And once we get that down, once we feel like, no, you know what?
[2603.88 --> 2607.78]  Every item that ships from our warehouse is just nice.
[2608.08 --> 2610.14]  Then we can start to do some more out there stuff.
[2610.28 --> 2610.40]  Yeah.
[2610.40 --> 2613.74]  I got to tell you, the store has been doing amazing.
[2614.50 --> 2619.38]  We did a coupon last week and we did the most orders that we've ever done in a week by a country mile.
[2619.38 --> 2625.98]  And we the thing is, we still only got like four or five shirt designs and like cable ties.
[2626.88 --> 2631.26]  And I think there's like one other thing, like some of the really cool stuff that I think is going to I made.
[2631.40 --> 2632.26]  I bet Nick.
[2633.10 --> 2634.56]  Have you seen the water bottle prototype?
[2635.20 --> 2635.76]  I think so.
[2635.90 --> 2636.26]  Oh, OK.
[2636.28 --> 2637.06]  I gave it to Steve.
[2637.18 --> 2637.68]  So I can't.
[2637.78 --> 2638.56]  You won't have another chance.
[2638.56 --> 2639.36]  I'm pretty sure I saw it.
[2639.42 --> 2639.54]  Yeah.
[2639.56 --> 2642.10]  I gave him our first prototype, the one with the circuit board on it.
[2642.12 --> 2642.28]  Right.
[2643.16 --> 2643.44]  Yes.
[2643.44 --> 2647.44]  So matte black with a glossy black circuit board and Linus tech tips up the side in orange.
[2647.44 --> 2649.48]  It looks incredible.
[2649.60 --> 2650.18]  I bet Nick.
[2650.26 --> 2658.32]  I told him if we don't sell a thousand of them in the first like three days, I think I said, I will be floored because it is so cool.
[2659.40 --> 2660.18]  It's so cool.
[2660.40 --> 2663.24]  LTX is probably going to have full plane charts.
[2665.04 --> 2665.80]  Oh, yeah, that's right.
[2665.96 --> 2666.80]  Not that many of them.
[2666.94 --> 2667.76]  Yeah, I don't.
[2667.96 --> 2669.10]  Yeah, we won't be printing that many.
[2669.10 --> 2674.60]  They're quite limited because I don't know how much interest there's going to be, but there's going to be some there.
[2674.60 --> 2686.62]  Basically, if you want to support Luke and rep Luke, you can buy a float plane shirt.
[2687.04 --> 2690.06]  Yeah, I think like I'm going to be buying some.
[2690.34 --> 2690.80]  Well, I guess.
[2691.40 --> 2697.20]  Yeah, I'm going to be taking some or buying some or whatever, giving them to float plane staff, giving them some friends and family.
[2697.20 --> 2703.32]  I'm going to be giving some to Kyle and to tech deals so they can have some of their own and whatnot.
[2703.56 --> 2706.96]  And then there will be like some left that will be at the event.
[2708.26 --> 2711.14]  So Derek Carpenter asked if I, Justine, is going to be there.
[2711.20 --> 2715.30]  If the question is about the roast tonight, the answer is unfortunately no.
[2715.38 --> 2718.34]  I totally invited her and I would have loved to have her there.
[2718.34 --> 2724.76]  And she was like, OMG, totally want to, cannot make it work with my schedule.
[2724.86 --> 2725.84]  And I was like, that's OK, dude.
[2725.92 --> 2727.00]  I totally get it.
[2727.56 --> 2729.42]  But she's not confirmed.
[2729.56 --> 2731.02]  So don't take this as gospel truth.
[2731.14 --> 2735.32]  My understanding is she is going to be making her absolute best effort to be at LTX this year, though.
[2736.00 --> 2741.44]  So our roster of pretty much confirmed creators is now about 15.
[2742.32 --> 2743.30]  Did you know that?
[2745.42 --> 2746.22]  Wait, for what?
[2746.42 --> 2747.04]  For LTX.
[2747.04 --> 2747.96]  Oh, OK, OK.
[2748.02 --> 2750.66]  Yeah, LTX is going to be nuts this year.
[2750.84 --> 2751.68]  That's actually really cool.
[2751.72 --> 2752.70]  I'm so excited.
[2752.80 --> 2753.98]  I'm crazy excited for LTX.
[2754.04 --> 2755.04]  A lot of them are pretty small.
[2755.62 --> 2765.84]  Like our cutoff for like kind of how big you had to be in tech in order to get free accommodation and travel was fairly reasonable, I think.
[2766.16 --> 2767.92]  So, yeah, should be pretty good.
[2768.06 --> 2768.22]  Yeah.
[2769.16 --> 2769.66]  All right.
[2769.68 --> 2770.66]  What else do we have to talk about?
[2770.72 --> 2771.72]  There is some more tech news, right?
[2771.88 --> 2773.42]  Oh, we got to be out of here in like six minutes.
[2773.42 --> 2776.14]  Uh, uh, uh, um.
[2777.90 --> 2779.04]  Uh, uh.
[2779.38 --> 2781.06]  I think we're dropping frames like crazy.
[2781.68 --> 2782.38]  Oh, really?
[2782.52 --> 2783.28]  Like on this?
[2783.40 --> 2784.00]  I think so.
[2784.08 --> 2784.94]  There's a whole bunch.
[2785.26 --> 2786.16]  400 and something.
[2787.30 --> 2787.68]  Why?
[2790.80 --> 2793.88]  Did Jake change it to GPU encoding or something?
[2794.62 --> 2796.38]  No, this still has like a 960 in it.
[2796.40 --> 2797.40]  I don't think it's, uh.
[2798.36 --> 2799.18]  Nope, it's not.
[2800.22 --> 2800.50]  Hmm.
[2800.90 --> 2802.32]  I don't know what's wrong with this machine.
[2802.60 --> 2803.90]  Maybe we should just like upgrade it.
[2803.92 --> 2804.70]  It's only a six core.
[2805.72 --> 2809.96]  You know what I noticed too is our, our, um, our capture laptop, the capture blade.
[2810.22 --> 2811.68]  I was trying to record on it today.
[2811.74 --> 2813.04]  Just 1080p 30.
[2813.04 --> 2817.58]  And it was at like 90% usage and it was dropping frames.
[2817.74 --> 2819.28]  I wonder if OBS just got a little heavier.
[2820.20 --> 2820.70]  I don't know.
[2821.24 --> 2826.22]  Anyway, we'll need to, uh, maybe we should just upgrade this machine and throw more horses at it.
[2826.86 --> 2827.40]  Call it good.
[2828.12 --> 2829.50]  Um, yeah, guys.
[2829.50 --> 2830.70]  Uh, yeah.
[2830.80 --> 2834.92]  I don't think the problem's on float plane because we're actually seeing OBS drop the frames here.
[2834.92 --> 2839.52]  So, uh, the machine that we're using to stream the show tonight is not this one.
[2839.56 --> 2843.18]  It's our streaming cart, which we use for like our Friday live streams and stuff like that.
[2843.18 --> 2844.68]  So I would expect that to be fine.
[2846.04 --> 2850.08]  Uh, Intel announces their broadest product portfolio for moving, storing, and processing data.
[2850.16 --> 2856.00]  They've got a whole bunch of stuff, including their 56 core, 12 memory channels, Xeon Platinum 9200 processor.
[2856.30 --> 2857.96]  They've got their second generation.
[2858.42 --> 2859.74]  Uh, oh, this is cool.
[2859.96 --> 2862.56]  So Optane DC persistent memory is finally here.
[2862.56 --> 2868.60]  So you can plunk an Optane module into a DIMM slot and you can have, I forget what it is.
[2868.62 --> 2872.74]  Is it up to a, uh, 512 gigs or something?
[2873.00 --> 2881.56]  Can't remember exactly how much, but you can have a ton of capacity in memory as long as whatever you're doing is not particularly latency sensitive.
[2881.86 --> 2886.70]  And it'll allow you to work on much larger data sets for things like AI and deep learning and all that kind of thing.
[2886.98 --> 2887.52]  That's cool.
[2887.52 --> 2891.52]  Their new Agilex FPGAs are built on 10 nanometer tech.
[2891.52 --> 2897.62]  So there's going to be FPGAs out there that are built on really like the latest cutting edge process node.
[2898.16 --> 2904.58]  Um, so we could expect to see better performance in things like, uh, for example, uh, high-end video cameras.
[2904.72 --> 2911.06]  So there's lots of products that you might kind of not think about, like, what kind of processor do they use?
[2911.06 --> 2921.16]  So an FPGA is, uh, a fully programmable chip that can kind of pretend to be a purpose-built integrated circuit.
[2921.40 --> 2930.02]  So instead of using a general purpose processor that can come with all kinds of overhead, um, that causes it to consume more power or not be as efficient for a task,
[2930.02 --> 2934.02]  an FPGA can be programmed specifically to do just one thing really well.
[2934.02 --> 2939.62]  And it's great for applications like, uh, video encoding and something like, uh, a RED camera.
[2939.62 --> 2952.86]  The problem is that while an FPGA is much more expensive than an actual, like, custom fabbed chip, um, you don't have to have nearly the same volume in order to make your business model work.
[2952.86 --> 2960.26]  So as long as you can build enough margin into your product that you can use FPGAs, which can be hundreds and hundreds of dollars each just for your CPU,
[2960.58 --> 2964.80]  then, uh, it's a great way to get performance that otherwise just wouldn't be possible.
[2964.80 --> 2968.52]  So higher performance FPGAs, great thing all around.
[2968.64 --> 2972.24]  With that said, I don't know anything about what the real world performance of these looks like.
[2972.50 --> 2974.34]  Just sounds pretty good.
[2974.38 --> 2976.02]  This is all just announcements right now.
[2976.12 --> 2978.24]  So just talking about the news.
[2978.84 --> 2979.54]  All right, other news.
[2979.54 --> 2983.22]  This was posted by RC Mail on the forum, Amazon, to offer broadband.
[2984.92 --> 2985.14]  Wow.
[2985.68 --> 2987.80]  I can't think of anything that could go wrong with that.
[2988.38 --> 2990.92]  Should I sign up for Facebook's phone line while I'm at it?
[2992.72 --> 2998.02]  Yeah, that's a, that's a little brutal in terms of the, like, literally owning your entire life thing.
[2998.12 --> 3003.28]  But it's going to be another one of those, like, we're putting satellites in space kind of situations.
[3003.56 --> 3006.34]  I don't think they're doing landlines or anything like that.
[3006.34 --> 3006.64]  Mm-hmm.
[3006.76 --> 3012.76]  But they, they're trying to increase the amount of people that can have access to the internet and have their homepage forced to Amazon.com.
[3012.80 --> 3012.96]  Yep.
[3013.02 --> 3015.50]  So they're, the project is codenamed Project Kuiper.
[3016.06 --> 3016.28]  Yep.
[3016.96 --> 3017.28]  Um.
[3017.40 --> 3017.94]  Something like that.
[3018.44 --> 3019.36]  Is that how you pronounce that?
[3019.94 --> 3020.58]  I think so.
[3020.86 --> 3022.72]  It's like K-U-I-P-E-R or something?
[3023.16 --> 3024.62]  Yeah, I think it's named after the Kuiper Belt.
[3024.62 --> 3025.80]  Which is, uh.
[3025.80 --> 3026.94]  That makes sense.
[3027.08 --> 3027.78]  Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3027.78 --> 3028.20]  Um.
[3029.52 --> 3039.68]  Anyway, their first public step took the form of three sets of filings made with the International Telecommunications Union last month by the Federal Communications Commission on behalf of Washington, D.C.-based Kuiper Systems, LLC.
[3039.68 --> 3045.92]  And the filings lay out a plan to put 3,236 satellites in low Earth orbit.
[3046.04 --> 3046.96]  Holy crap.
[3048.70 --> 3048.98]  Uh.
[3048.98 --> 3057.96]  So it'll be a constellation of satellites that will provide low latency, high speed broadband connectivity to unserved and underserved communities around the world.
[3057.96 --> 3064.16]  This is a long term project that envisions serving tens of millions of people who lack basic access to broadband internet.
[3064.52 --> 3068.14]  We look forward to partnering on its initiative with companies that share this common vision.
[3068.14 --> 3070.14]  Fantastic.
[3071.82 --> 3072.14]  Um.
[3072.38 --> 3077.24]  The United Nations estimates that almost 4 billion people around the globe are underserved when it comes to internet access.
[3078.16 --> 3079.94]  They didn't provide a timeline for deployment.
[3081.02 --> 3081.86]  Don't blame them.
[3081.94 --> 3082.82]  I suspect it'll be a while.
[3082.88 --> 3086.18]  And I guess that's honestly all that I have because we need to go.
[3086.26 --> 3087.08]  It is 5.59.
[3087.26 --> 3087.40]  Yeah.
[3087.42 --> 3088.36]  And we need to drive.
[3088.56 --> 3089.08]  We gotta roll.
[3089.44 --> 3090.14]  So, uh.
[3090.92 --> 3094.22]  For those of you on Floatplane, we will see you there.
[3094.40 --> 3095.94]  Floatplane is $3 a month.
[3096.04 --> 3097.00]  Go to floatplane.com.
[3097.10 --> 3097.46]  Sign up.
[3097.46 --> 3100.04]  The live stream will be in a couple hours, like two, two and a half hours.
[3100.80 --> 3101.42]  And, uh.
[3102.26 --> 3103.16]  Hopefully this goes okay.
[3103.22 --> 3104.30]  Oh, I should do super chat.
[3104.38 --> 3104.86]  Super chats.
[3106.12 --> 3106.52]  Um.
[3106.56 --> 3107.68]  We legit don't have a ton of time.
[3107.94 --> 3108.44]  Okay, okay.
[3108.44 --> 3108.90]  Try to fly through.
[3109.14 --> 3109.76]  I'll go fast.
[3110.00 --> 3110.34]  Uh.
[3110.56 --> 3110.82]  Damon.
[3111.32 --> 3113.44]  AMD Navi GPUs are gaining traction again in news media.
[3113.58 --> 3114.72]  What are your predictions and thoughts?
[3116.20 --> 3117.40]  Man, it's AMD rumors.
[3117.48 --> 3118.44]  What am I supposed to tell you?
[3119.02 --> 3121.22]  I predict that it'll be whatever it is.
[3121.26 --> 3123.68]  And the rumors will have no impact on that.
[3123.74 --> 3124.38]  We'll do the intro.
[3124.50 --> 3124.90]  Calm down.
[3124.90 --> 3125.34]  Um.
[3125.34 --> 3127.78]  Brent says, update for BYOC tickets at LTX.
[3127.88 --> 3128.22]  Uh.
[3128.28 --> 3129.26]  Coming later.
[3129.58 --> 3131.20]  Follow LTX Expo on Twitter.
[3131.76 --> 3132.08]  Uh.
[3132.12 --> 3134.68]  Paul says, I just want to say, keep kicking ass, guys.
[3135.04 --> 3135.46]  Thanks, Paul.
[3136.22 --> 3136.56]  Ryan.
[3136.74 --> 3137.34]  You guys are great.
[3137.42 --> 3137.80]  Keep it up.
[3137.92 --> 3138.38]  Thanks, Ryan.
[3138.86 --> 3139.18]  Uh.
[3139.24 --> 3139.80]  Captain Zero.
[3139.96 --> 3141.66]  Does the live stream on Floatplane work on mobile?
[3141.66 --> 3143.08]  Yes.
[3143.26 --> 3143.54]  Yeah.
[3143.88 --> 3144.20]  Yes.
[3145.20 --> 3145.40]  Yeah.
[3145.48 --> 3145.96]  I don't see why not.
[3146.14 --> 3146.80]  It's through the browser.
[3147.04 --> 3147.66]  It's not through the app.
[3147.80 --> 3147.94]  Yeah.
[3148.12 --> 3149.56]  Although we do have an app update.
[3149.78 --> 3151.12]  And live stream works on it.
[3151.72 --> 3152.04]  Uh.
[3152.04 --> 3152.34]  Revenant.
[3152.62 --> 3154.30]  What old school forums did you use to post in?
[3154.42 --> 3155.30]  Extreme Systems.org.
[3155.30 --> 3156.42]  Extreme Overclocking.com.
[3156.50 --> 3157.44]  Red Flag Deals.com.
[3157.50 --> 3158.28]  And MCIX forums.
[3158.44 --> 3159.24]  Mostly OCN.
[3159.38 --> 3160.26]  But other stuff included.
[3160.68 --> 3160.86]  Uh.
[3160.86 --> 3164.06]  Someone with a Russian name sent us some rubles.
[3164.20 --> 3164.74]  You guys rock.
[3164.92 --> 3165.26]  Thanks.
[3165.36 --> 3166.64]  Russian guy or gal.
[3167.28 --> 3167.52]  Ryan.
[3167.64 --> 3168.70]  I may need to get Floatplane now.
[3168.90 --> 3169.12]  Yes.
[3169.16 --> 3169.72]  You may need to.
[3169.80 --> 3172.28]  You probably shouldn't have spent that $2 on that Super Chat.
[3172.48 --> 3174.10]  You probably should have just spent it on Floatplane.
[3174.34 --> 3175.40]  But that's okay.
[3176.88 --> 3177.48]  Good job.
[3177.80 --> 3178.50]  Thanos Gaming.
[3178.60 --> 3179.80]  Will you be doing more RG Rig reboot?
[3179.98 --> 3180.20]  Yes.
[3180.24 --> 3181.52]  If it's within our power, we will.
[3181.60 --> 3183.02]  But it's on ASUS whether it happens or not.
[3183.44 --> 3183.68]  George.
[3183.74 --> 3186.28]  Why does Luke's beard connect to the right side but not the left?
[3186.70 --> 3186.92]  What?
[3187.12 --> 3187.74]  Must be a bug.
[3188.18 --> 3188.36]  Yeah.
[3188.40 --> 3188.80]  It probably is.
[3189.54 --> 3189.72]  Uh.
[3189.72 --> 3189.94]  Matt.
[3189.94 --> 3191.46]  Get Floatplane for the live stream of the roast.
[3191.60 --> 3192.10]  Thank you, Matt.
[3192.66 --> 3192.80]  Uh.
[3193.52 --> 3194.70]  I'm just reading everything.
[3195.06 --> 3195.30]  Zion.
[3195.44 --> 3197.84]  Can you not get interchange rate for credit card processing?
[3198.54 --> 3199.38]  What does that even mean?
[3202.02 --> 3202.58]  Tristan Adam.
[3202.76 --> 3203.90]  Says just subscribed on Floatplane.
[3204.06 --> 3205.56]  Interchange rate for card processing.
[3205.98 --> 3206.22]  Huh?
[3206.96 --> 3207.22]  Yeah.
[3207.30 --> 3208.58]  We'll have to figure that out.
[3208.58 --> 3208.80]  Oh.
[3208.88 --> 3210.26]  I think I know what he's talking about and.
[3211.14 --> 3211.66]  Nah, dude.
[3211.92 --> 3212.14]  Eric.
[3212.30 --> 3214.06]  You don't find it funny because you always roasted.
[3214.46 --> 3214.76]  Well, no, no.
[3214.78 --> 3216.44]  I mean when I'm watching other people's roasts.
[3216.54 --> 3216.88]  T-Bone.
[3216.96 --> 3218.14]  Says I'd love to subscribe to Floatplane.
[3218.22 --> 3219.08]  Is there going to be an Android app?
[3219.14 --> 3219.36]  Yes.
[3219.36 --> 3220.36]  Um.
[3221.48 --> 3223.18]  It's not going to be open source anymore, though.
[3223.24 --> 3224.26]  We changed our minds.
[3224.68 --> 3225.54]  More on this at 11.
[3225.68 --> 3225.96]  Joshua.
[3226.16 --> 3227.04]  Steve equals tech Jesus.
[3227.20 --> 3228.34]  Jay equals tech Judas.
[3228.56 --> 3229.74]  Linus equals tech Moses.
[3230.38 --> 3231.14]  Because sandals.
[3231.54 --> 3232.16]  Thank you for that.
[3233.16 --> 3233.60]  Um.
[3234.88 --> 3235.28]  Wow.
[3236.28 --> 3236.72]  Uh.
[3236.72 --> 3237.16]  Uh.
[3237.16 --> 3237.20]  Okay.
[3237.20 --> 3237.22]  Uh.
[3237.22 --> 3237.86]  Bye.
[3237.86 --> 3238.36]  Uh.
[3238.36 --> 3238.40]  Uh.
[3238.40 --> 3238.84]  Bye.
[3238.84 --> 3239.68]  Wait.
[3239.68 --> 3240.14]  Uh.
[3240.14 --> 3240.76]  The intro.
[3240.76 --> 3242.46]  They're going to freak out.
[3242.46 --> 3242.94]  Hey.
[3242.94 --> 3242.96]  Hey.
[3242.96 --> 3245.04]  I'm a graphic designer, gamer, artist, writer, and photography.
[3245.18 --> 3246.50]  Obviously, I spend a lot of time on my computer.
[3246.60 --> 3248.26]  Can you recommend a good budget chair?
[3249.26 --> 3250.94]  Preferably racing as I find them most comfortable.
[3251.04 --> 3251.78]  250 bucks.
[3251.92 --> 3252.14]  Oh.
[3252.22 --> 3253.60]  Honestly, I hate to be this guy.
[3253.96 --> 3257.62]  But 250 bucks, for whatever reason, is not a lot of chair.
[3258.62 --> 3258.98]  Um.
[3259.56 --> 3260.80]  That's the cold, hard truth.
[3261.00 --> 3261.28]  Yeah.
[3261.44 --> 3261.98]  I'm so sorry.
[3262.06 --> 3262.54]  Chairs are.
[3262.54 --> 3263.58]  To be the one to break it to you.
[3263.60 --> 3264.20]  Obscenely expensive.
[3264.96 --> 3265.24]  Um.
[3265.32 --> 3265.82]  You're probably.
[3265.98 --> 3268.56]  Like a really good chair, you're probably looking at six or seven hundred.
[3269.24 --> 3269.56]  I'm.
[3269.72 --> 3270.62]  I hate that.
[3270.78 --> 3271.86]  There's no reason they should be.
[3271.94 --> 3272.78]  It makes no sense to me.
[3272.84 --> 3273.34]  But they are.
[3274.14 --> 3274.54]  Um.
[3274.72 --> 3279.10]  Connor says, can I come work for y'all so I can quit my semi-crappy job at the university
[3279.10 --> 3280.20]  working in their IT department?
[3281.38 --> 3281.78]  Um.
[3282.98 --> 3286.46]  Not unless you applied recently when we posted job postings.
[3286.54 --> 3286.74]  Okay.
[3286.74 --> 3287.28]  Bye, everyone.
[3287.94 --> 3288.22]  Intro.
[3288.64 --> 3289.04]  I got it.
[3289.06 --> 3289.26]  I got it.
[3289.26 --> 3289.60]  There we go.
[3290.64 --> 3294.32]  They would actually hunt me down and murder me, as far as I can tell, if we didn't run that.
[3310.74 --> 3311.74]  Bye.
