How about you fix your steam, use the 8K cameras to upload to AT LEAST 1080p 60 fps. Can you do that, are you that behind Gamers Nexus? What about timestamps in the description? Too complicated for you? Seriously? WTF???

YouTube rounding subscriber count is not the biggest problem with this rounding fever.  It's their relative timestamps.  Something released 17 months ago is shown as "1 year ago".  It's impossible to find a video by date in a channel's video list.  You literally cannot see the date without actually opening the video.  Relative timestamps are always, always atrocious.

That said, rounding subscriber numbers is also daft.  Anyone who cares about the number wants to know the number, not an approximation of the number.

And no, it's not a hard 'g' in GIF.  It's a soft 'g'.  That's an objective fact, which is not a matter of opinion.  Everyone pronouncing GIF with a hard 'g' is simply wrong.

fuck this channel...it takes so long for anyone to timestamp topics. i'm not watching all these 1 hour 15 minute things just to guess where all of their stories are in the timeline. most of it isn't even relevant stuff to what i normally like to know. takes so long for them to figure it out man...jeez...
