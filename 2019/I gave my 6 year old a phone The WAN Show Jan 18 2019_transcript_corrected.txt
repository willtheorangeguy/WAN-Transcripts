[0.44 → 7.28] Hey, um I can hear myself through there which is super, super weird and I hope that's not echoing
[8.38 → 13.82] There's a problem. There's one minor problem. There's a minor problem those headphones. I don't know where to unplug them
[16.94 → 22.80] They're like pretty loud ah you hear that yeah, I hear it. Hopefully the audience can't are we live, is it?
[23.44 → 27.38] Are we live right now? Yeah. Hey, hey, it's when showtime
[27.38 → 32.92] Hey, actually the video I was working on just now sounded super cool really cool
[32.92 → 39.52] So have you seen that that like what is it like 10 year challenge hashtag or something?
[39.52 → 43.90] Oh, yeah, I got a photo for that. That's hilarious. I haven't posted 2009 2019
[45.06 → 50.98] So we did one but like not my old Facebook pictures or anything because I don't post on Facebook
[52.14 → 53.28] but
[53.28 → 54.66] LTT
[54.66 → 61.88] Okay, because I was a nine versus 2019. Yeah, so LTT actually just celebrated its 10-year anniversary
[61.88 → 62.66] Yeah
[62.66 → 65.92] And then the funny thing about that you're right that is really loud. Yeah
[66.54 → 68.90] Okay, like we got unplug them
[73.42 → 75.42] Okay, yeah
[75.42 → 80.64] So LTT actually celebrated its 10-year anniversary not that long ago
[80.64 → 87.42] So it's effectively a look at the entire history of the channel. Yeah, because the only things that were posted in 2008
[88.62 → 94.18] Honestly, we're not what LTT would be over the next three years
[94.18 → 96.64] Okay, so I don't know if you know this but at the time
[96.64 → 102.86] I was working with Keaton who was a writer slash the video guy for Hardware Canucks
[102.86 → 103.86] Okay
[103.86 → 108.08] So a lot of Hardware Canucks viewers probably won't remember this but
[108.08 → 109.08] but
[109.08 → 110.08] fixed or fixed
[110.08 → 120.08] was the both the video personality and the shooter and editor for Hardware Canucks videos for some time before Dimitri came onto the scene
[120.08 → 120.58] Yeah
[120.58 → 122.58] So he was shooting for you?
[122.58 → 128.48] So the original idea with Linus Tech Tips was that it was going to be like a lower production value thing
[128.66 → 129.50] but
[129.50 → 133.62] Keaton who I am quite certain is not watching this so
[133.94 → 135.94] I don't have to worry about
[135.94 → 138.70] I don't have to worry about getting into any trouble here
[138.96 → 139.90] but
[139.90 → 141.90] Keaton had sort of a
[142.38 → 146.14] Don't know if you'd call it a disorder or a compulsion or
[146.14 → 153.62] Thank you. I don't know what you'd call it, but he just couldn't let anything be sort of just good enough
[154.64 → 160.46] So the original idea behind Linus Tech Tips was that it was supposed to be like the cheapo
[160.46 → 164.08] Run and gun as fast as you can get it out as fast as you can pump them out thing
[164.08 → 171.04] Like my quota was 45 videos a month on top of like I had a real job on top of the four to six MIX Tech Tips
[171.04 → 173.76] I remember one of my favourite things was it was super important when I
[173.76 → 178.76] I pressed record and when I press stop record because we were not going to edit it
[179.38 → 185.96] so like if I didn't if I is there was a huge delay between me pressing recording you starting to talk
[185.96 → 190.82] It was awkward and if I let it run for too long after you stop talking. It was awkward. So that was like
[193.82 → 199.54] We run into trouble sometimes where like Luke would think I was done, and I would think I was done, but then I'd be like
[199.54 → 204.54] Oh except for what and like oh, sorry. I already pressed record, and you'd be like, okay
[204.54 → 206.54] I guess that's it
[206.54 → 213.18] I guess the video is over so Keaton couldn't do that so the first couple of Linus Tech Tips videos
[213.18 → 220.68] Actually from like an effort standpoint anyway were quite a bit higher production values
[220.68 → 223.68] Oh, okay like the first one has a laugh track
[224.68 → 229.18] So like there's actual editing in it. I don't know if I've seen the first
[229.68 → 234.68] Linus Tech Tips video. I know I've seen the first NCX Tech Tips video. Oh, yeah
[234.68 → 235.68] No, the first
[235.68 → 236.68] I don't know if I ever
[236.68 → 239.68] The first line of the video. I talked our AMD rep into
[240.68 → 245.68] Allowing us to do a pre-release video. I've seen that of an undisclosed processor
[245.68 → 252.68] And he was like well, you can't leak any useful information about it. So the only thing I was essentially able to say was I have it
[252.68 → 253.68] I remember this
[253.68 → 258.68] But there's actual electrical tape on the screen to ensure that no
[258.68 → 265.68] You know, you know, you know how okay, you know how if you have like an image, and you like scribble over it, you know
[265.68 → 267.68] You can kind of unscribbled it
[267.68 → 268.68] Unscribbled it
[268.68 → 273.68] The guy who swirled his face and the FBI unfurled it. Yeah, like yeah zero Jeffery. Okay
[274.68 → 275.68] Electrical tape
[275.68 → 282.68] Stuck to the screen. I could not see what was under it. Yeah, but it was just like oh, there's a there's a processor
[282.68 → 284.68] and then the second one was like
[284.68 → 290.68] The idea was there of it being like cheapo unboxing that were just these very brief looks at a product
[290.68 → 295.68] Where it was an unboxing of a rampage 3 extreme or rampage like really hold port at this point
[295.68 → 303.68] Rampage 2 extreme. I don't know. It doesn't matter the point is it was a rampage board, and it had this goofy little like knob on it
[303.68 → 305.68] Um
[305.68 → 312.68] That was supposed to be like an OC knob to OC up or down. So like a shifter. It had a shifter
[312.68 → 316.68] So the beginning of the video starts with me holding the driver disc like this
[317.68 → 319.68] I'm like pretending to drive it
[320.68 → 324.68] I liked that kitschiness. I know it wasn't good, but like it was bad
[324.68 → 329.68] I found it entertaining the best part of like people complaining about I would know
[329.68 → 334.68] Yeah, the sex jokes or the dad humour or the cringe or whatever else
[334.68 → 339.68] I remember when Linus Tech Tips didn't have any of this stuff like oh, oh, do you know?
[339.68 → 341.68] What were you watching?
[341.68 → 350.18] Because clearly not Linus Tech Tips. It was terrible from day one literally in the first 10 seconds of the first video ever uploaded to the channel
[350.18 → 358.68] There's a laugh track. Okay, that's brutal. I turn around in my chair basically like an oh didn't see you there a moment and I bumped the table
[358.68 → 361.68] And a laugh track goes off, and I'm like oh
[361.68 → 368.58] In the first 10 seconds. Okay, so I 100% have seen this video, but I just don't remember that I
[368.58 → 373.58] I remember you hitting the table, but I don't remember the laugh track my brain just like edited that out
[373.58 → 380.28] It's like no, you're not allowed to know that can't happen. You know what? There's no left. We don't really have any good topics today
[380.28 → 384.86] No, as Colton did the WAN show doc. Let's just watch so we're just gonna we're going to watch this video
[384.86 → 386.86] I mean, I mean that's what twitch streamers do these days
[387.42 → 393.26] Anyway, there's there's going to be a lot more insight in the like 2009 to 2019 video
[393.26 → 398.26] You know, what's really what was a really cool thing about that video? I'm pretty sure I can talk about this now
[398.26 → 405.46] Like I don't think there's an NDA or anything, but it's sponsored by B&H. Oh, cool. Yeah. Yeah, so like
[406.26 → 409.62] honestly boy, so like half the content in that video is going to be like
[411.76 → 416.56] No, no because that's the point that's the point they knew what they were sponsored. Okay. Yeah, it's all good
[416.56 → 422.92] We used to have a point shoot with scratch lens. Okay, like it was, and I was doing it
[423.46 → 425.46] That combination is bad
[426.40 → 433.42] So, um, no, no they know it's all good. So like part of the cool thing about going through this progression is that
[434.32 → 438.68] Where we started out compared to like B&H wanting to work with us
[438.68 → 446.68] Oh, it's like a 10-year change in terms of like the both the business side and the production values the fact that
[447.24 → 450.18] B&H will even pick up the phone to talk to us
[450.18 → 452.18] They wouldn't have any
[452.74 → 458.58] We're still trying to just like, you know run around with a cell phone. Hey, what's this fire engine?
[459.42 → 461.42] Oh, I
[461.78 → 468.18] Hate that that video is still the top viewed video on the channel. What's it at now? It's over 10 million. Oh, I don't know
[468.68 → 471.28] All right. Um, so this is it
[471.28 → 476.54] I don't actually know if you guys are going to have audio capture from my computer. So
[477.20 → 484.06] Good luck everybody else. I also don't even know if this is going to work. Yeah, I didn't test it. Yeah, that's that's the intro
[485.18 → 487.18] Yeah, how do you like that?
[487.18 → 489.28] 4 by 3 aspect ratio there, baby
[490.22 → 492.14] Also, it was only a minute 20
[492.14 → 499.72] See I remember that I very clearly remember that, but I still don't remember the laugh track
[499.72 → 503.86] I'm actually kind of happy I can't hear is this what YouTube does to 4 by 3 videos now?
[503.86 → 509.22] Just make it like weird and squish letter and pillar boxed. That's pretty weird
[509.78 → 512.22] Okay, so we showed it running at 3.6 gigahertz
[512.78 → 516.56] Um, honestly though this one's not as cringy. I don't know if they have audio
[517.18 → 518.18] uh
[518.18 → 520.18] Mike clipping something
[521.26 → 526.48] Where's the sound is there no sound? Oh, apparently the sound is too low Luke's ducky vid was great
[526.48 → 532.86] It is, but it's not going to be in that 2009 2019 thing because that was not technically a Linus tech tips video
[532.94 → 535.88] That was when I was like still planning on do my own thing
[536.84 → 538.84] Thanks happy. I didn't do that
[539.36 → 543.66] That would have been a disaster. I don't know that that video seemed pretty good. Oh, yeah. Yeah
[543.66 → 551.68] I mean for the time it seemed pretty legit probably about par. I mean considering how bad like my stuff was at that time like
[552.76 → 555.50] Everything was kind of bad back then. Yeah, everything was terrible
[555.50 → 562.58] Um, sorry, I'm just loading up the float plane stream so I can see comments from these guys title on here is wrong because you weren't logged in
[562.58 → 566.20] Oh, yeah, dang it. Yeah, sorry everyone
[566.94 → 573.58] All right, apparently you're too close to the mic. Yeah, but I can't really like did someone come in here and like to make changes to this or something?
[574.50 → 575.00] Okay
[576.24 → 581.40] Apparently the audio is why do people make changes I specifically said on my way out from lunch? Yes
[581.40 → 584.12] I know it's kind of too quiet. Don't make any changes
[584.12 → 587.20] Um, well that's not what happened
[589.76 → 591.76] Ah
[591.76 → 602.82] Are you just moving it away? Yeah, slightly okay, uh, I'm probably going to be too loud regardless, but you know apparently I'm too loud you're too
[603.78 → 605.28] What yeah?
[605.28 → 610.92] No, I've got people saying audio is clipping like just audio is clipping so
[610.92 → 616.36] um, that's a big actual problem and that's very frustrating because
[617.36 → 622.16] This is why this is why I say these things. There are too many dials. I don't know all the dials
[622.80 → 627.96] We just have way too much like the fact that we're running a singular mic, and we have all this junk is ridiculous
[627.96 → 632.56] My streams' audio always sounds significantly better and I just have one mixer
[633.68 → 637.16] Yeah, like I don't I don't it shouldn't be this hard
[637.16 → 643.10] I don't know the frustrating thing is everyone in chat in flow plane though is saying that the stream looks amazing
[643.10 → 645.04] So heck yeah
[645.04 → 648.40] There we go. Oh, good. Yeah, we have that. Yeah
[648.40 → 652.80] Um, so what just said turn all the dials if we just randomize everything
[653.60 → 659.16] It might end up better. All right. Well, I'm just I'm just going to be relatively quiet, and I'm gonna hope for the best
[659.16 → 665.84] Okay, um, we do have technically a Sancho document this week. Do we not there are there?
[665.84 → 672.04] There are news. There are notes. I just got signed out, but Intel discontinues core plus octane processors Wow
[672.04 → 675.46] That was not gonna eventually happen for sure
[675.46 → 678.98] Um, the mother of all breaches exposes
[678.98 → 684.88] 773 million emails and 21 million passwords
[684.88 → 686.42] Oh boy
[686.42 → 689.48] Facebook is apparently secretly building lol
[689.48 → 691.36] a meme hub
[691.36 → 697.80] Isn't Facebook already a meme hub like this is the thing that kind of blows my mind. It's like
[697.80 → 701.92] Facebook's like yeah, we need to purchase WhatsApp to get into the like
[701.92 → 705.06] like messaging private messaging game
[705.06 → 707.22] But then Facebook Messenger is a thing
[708.18 → 713.06] And like apparently people use like Instagram as their social network now. Yep. Can I help you?
[713.78 → 719.06] Oh, I just want to play with the dials. You want to terrible. Are you the one who adjusted this? No. Who touched it?
[719.70 → 724.90] I'm trying to not throw people under buses. Can you find who touched it? Maybe that would probably be perfect
[725.14 → 729.14] I just I was just gonna look for the thing that's red. Just keep talking. Uh, okay
[729.14 → 735.30] Don't bother with me. Yeah, the problem is that then you're going to end up adjusting the compressor, and it's really better not to touch the compressor
[737.38 → 739.30] Okay, fine then do whatever you want
[740.10 → 744.02] I know how they work too, but that doesn't change the honestly I don't even think that one works properly
[744.02 → 747.06] Like I think all of that just needs to go in the garbage
[747.94 → 750.98] And you just need one good. Yeah, well the issue is that
[751.70 → 752.74] two weeks ago
[752.74 → 755.86] Jake added a preamp with the goal of making the audio quality better and
[756.18 → 758.18] Then that was when people started complaining
[758.18 → 762.90] The show was too quiet, and then he went on vacation and then called in sick today
[763.54 → 767.06] So he's not here to fix his stupid preamp, and he's the one who put it in
[767.06 → 773.86] And the way it's hooked up is complicated and so someone else came in and tried to fix it, and they didn't have this is the best
[773.86 → 777.46] Sancho, I mean, there's also just doing this is that better. Hold on stop, Alex
[778.34 → 784.82] I'm just going to turn it down in OBS. No, no stop stops stop don't move anything. Everything's clipping on here. You can turn down as much as
[784.82 → 786.82] You want there with something on here still
[787.14 → 793.22] Yeah, but it seems to be getting better. So just keep talking. Okay. All right. Well, hopefully it's getting better. You guys are witnessing real-time
[794.18 → 795.62] real-time
[795.62 → 797.62] Editing of things
[797.62 → 804.88] Now we're a bit too quiet. Oh, wow. You know what? I just I give up. I give up no Sancho today
[805.38 → 807.38] I'm done. I'm done
[808.50 → 811.48] People say it's fine now. So just don't touch it
[812.48 → 817.96] You're still touching it. You're still touching it. We're just we're just going to go with what we have. I don't even I don't even care
[817.96 → 824.56] I don't even care. It's its Trevor s says at least it's not your rape leave it for now. Oh boy
[825.62 → 829.06] Okay, all right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Don't spam, please
[829.70 → 830.90] All right
[830.90 → 834.88] So why don't we jump into our core plus octane processor?
[834.88 → 841.36] So you guys the original article here is from kit guru and I don't know where Colton got all these news items
[841.36 → 848.96] But it's obviously not the forum because he's not crediting people on the forum, and it doesn't look like he's looking at
[850.00 → 850.62] the
[850.62 → 852.62] the tech linked
[852.62 → 854.62] items for this week
[854.62 → 860.52] So there 's's a spot actually on the Sancho doc for both items that make it into tech linked and ones that are sort of notable
[860.52 → 862.14] But don't make it into tech linked. Okay
[863.20 → 870.06] So I just like I just don't even know what he was doing. But anyway, this is over on kit guru and
[871.10 → 873.10] Do you remember core plus?
[875.18 → 877.18] Vaguely
[877.18 → 879.18] Do you know what it is? No
[879.18 → 880.54] I
[880.54 → 885.90] Remember the branding I don't really remember care. So core plus was a brand that from my understanding
[886.64 → 890.88] Was mostly intended to only really exist on
[892.34 → 894.34] Mobile, but then
[894.58 → 901.08] What's interesting here is that it appears as though there were actual desktop processors including an 8700
[901.74 → 906.14] 8400 and a core i5 8500 that also had it and the idea was that
[906.14 → 909.78] The processor was bundled with octane memory
[911.02 → 918.70] So it's core in that the processor is just a regular old core processor. Okay. I7 I5 or whatever
[918.70 → 922.56] Yeah, and then it was plus because it came with octane
[924.42 → 928.18] Now to be clear I'm not I'm not down on octane
[929.08 → 933.94] Very cool technology. I've been a proponent of SSD caching since it first showed up
[933.94 → 940.38] Um in Intel's product stack with what RST. I believe there were solutions before that in fact
[941.02 → 944.40] Wow thinking back it really has been a very long time
[944.96 → 949.20] um OCT had a drive that I think they called the synapse
[950.24 → 952.24] uh
[952.24 → 954.24] Synapse drives that sound right
[955.10 → 957.96] OCT synapse yeah, is that right? Yeah, okay
[957.96 → 964.60] So they had a caching drive that came with like this weird third-party software, and it was designed with twice the spare area
[964.60 → 968.72] So it was like it had half the accessible capacity
[969.56 → 976.28] That was actually on the drive and then the idea was that it could easily sustain high performance over time because this was back before
[976.28 → 979.04] I think this is before trim even existed
[979.04 → 985.28] Uh, so it could run garbage collection because it had so much spare area, and it would last for longer because it had more spare area
[985.68 → 990.24] And you had to install this software and I don't even remember if it worked on a boot volume
[990.24 → 995.04] Like it might have just been something that you can do on like a storage volume. I don't even remember the details
[995.04 → 997.28] It didn't it didn't sell well because it's like super expensive
[997.68 → 1002.88] Anyway, Intel moved it more mainstream with RST or rapid storage technology
[1002.88 → 1008.48] And I've been a proponent of it ever since because I think it's a great way to get better performance out of magnetic storage
[1008.48 → 1013.28] Whether it's for your boot drive or whether it's just for your game drive like we actually did one recently
[1013.76 → 1016.56] Um, where we compared we ran octane on AMD
[1016.96 → 1018.56] Which was kind of cool
[1018.56 → 1025.68] But using third-party software that has come a long way in the last 10 years and actually worked really, really well
[1025.68 → 1028.88] Like better than AMD's first-party solution store am I?
[1029.52 → 1030.56] um
[1030.56 → 1037.76] Sorry one quick thing. Yeah, can I do that thing again because there are a lot of questions in here which thing the stream thing
[1037.76 → 1039.04] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[1039.04 → 1044.16] Okay, so I'm getting a redone amount of quite probably more than I have any other week, which is kind of surprising
[1044.32 → 1052.08] Um, but if there's people that have questions about full plane that are full plane members or not come to my stream after the stream and ask me then because I have to
[1052.48 → 1057.20] Partake in the wan show. Yeah, and that is important. Yeah, so talk about core plus
[1057.44 → 1062.40] Yeah, core plus. Yeah, so you know, it's one random little thing. I want to add. I still have that synapse drive
[1062.40 → 1068.48] Do you really yeah the 30 gig one wow yeah, why I just I don't know you should use it as a cache
[1069.20 → 1071.20] I mean, it'd be slow as hell
[1072.00 → 1074.56] Isn't it yeah? Yeah, I think so. It's ancient
[1074.80 → 1080.56] Yeah, because that isn't that like pre sand force that's got my parents house because I remember you gave it to me when I used to live there
[1080.88 → 1081.36] Oh
[1081.36 → 1084.40] And then I guess I stopped using it. So it's like still there
[1084.56 → 1089.12] Was it one of those like I never want to see this again things, or you know I do something to deserve it
[1089.12 → 1090.64] I
[1090.64 → 1095.44] Think it was I don't want to deal with this. Okay, cool. Yeah, I think that was it
[1095.92 → 1099.44] So anyway long story short, I'm cool with caching. I think it's great
[1100.16 → 1103.36] However, yeah, the branding behind
[1104.08 → 1112.32] Like that core plus branding is terrible. I honestly the branding and the marketing around almost everything that touches octane has been really rough
[1112.32 → 1117.68] There were a lot of things that they could have done to just make it
[1118.96 → 1124.40] Yeah, just make it better and easier to understand like locking it down less and like
[1125.52 → 1128.40] I don't know anyway, really funky octanes cool
[1129.12 → 1135.52] Um, this solution selling it bundled with a processor is super dumb. They should just sell it as a processor
[1135.52 → 1140.48] And an octane module. Yeah, um, you can even sell it as like a bundle
[1140.72 → 1145.60] Just say that not core plus. Yeah, because core plus sounds like
[1147.52 → 1153.76] Like a k-skew style thing. Yeah, you know what I mean, or it sounds like it has more course. Yeah, sure
[1154.00 → 1155.68] Yeah, you know again
[1156.32 → 1163.20] Everything's got like a 10-year theme. I think it was like 11 12 years ago that intel released their core series processors. I'm still mad
[1164.16 → 1166.32] It's so stupid. Why do I have to say
[1167.20 → 1169.60] Core i7 quad-core processor?
[1170.64 → 1172.64] Why do I have to say core twice?
[1173.76 → 1174.72] It's so dumb
[1176.00 → 1181.68] I actually liked the i7 i5 i3 thing when it first came out really when it first came out
[1183.52 → 1185.52] I don't justify it. I know I'm listening
[1185.68 → 1192.16] It is helped categorize things for me when I was trying to do explain things to other people and I know
[1192.16 → 1197.76] Actually proper defining lines between the categories have always been really weird
[1199.84 → 1202.80] But in general most things kind of line up pretty well
[1204.80 → 1206.80] Do they
[1209.44 → 1213.20] I don't necessarily want to fall on this story, but like if I was is someone was like
[1214.24 → 1218.32] What's the difference if someone who knew basically nothing was like what's the difference between
[1219.12 → 1221.12] i's and i's?
[1221.12 → 1223.12] With sandy bridge, what would you say?
[1226.00 → 1226.72] I would say
[1227.68 → 1231.28] Go watch this excellent video over on the channel tech
[1231.28 → 1233.28] But sandy bridge so pre-tech quickie
[1233.28 → 1234.24] Okay, pre-tech quickie
[1234.24 → 1235.76] Can't talk today
[1235.76 → 1238.48] I would say a core i7
[1239.44 → 1239.76] Is
[1241.28 → 1244.32] Maybe going to have more memory channels
[1244.88 → 1249.28] Okay, but also they don't know anything they don't know what memory channel I'm talking total layman
[1249.92 → 1252.80] I worked at Best Buy at this time. I'm selling laptops
[1253.04 → 1257.52] Okay, I would say and like a core i7 might have onboard video
[1257.52 → 1264.32] But might not it's a laptop well there were desktop ones
[1264.32 → 1266.32] Yes, there were sandy bridge desktop ones
[1266.80 → 1271.04] Some of them were triple channel memory some of them were dual some of them were architecturally
[1271.28 → 1275.04] A generation ahead of the other ones that were on the high-end platform
[1275.76 → 1277.84] We sold like a desktop a week
[1278.64 → 1280.64] Laptops were selling like this
[1280.64 → 1287.92] So what your experience inside Best Buy is all that matters and no I was saying it was useful to me at that time
[1288.64 → 1292.48] Okay, but couldn't they just as easily I didn't say it was good. Okay, I didn't say it was good
[1292.48 → 1298.88] Couldn't they have just as easily gone? Okay, gold silver bronze. Yep, the gold one the gold two. Yep
[1300.64 → 1302.64] The gold
[1302.64 → 1306.96] Quebec market they could have I'm not saying I don't I'm not saying it was good not that I'm saying that's good either
[1306.96 → 1311.84] What they've done with the Leon gold silver bronze it's terrible. It's terrible. It's an atrocity also terrible
[1312.40 → 1313.20] um
[1313.20 → 1315.20] I just in general
[1316.56 → 1322.16] It was helpful to be like that one has this stuff extra there you go it has hyper threading
[1322.16 → 1324.48] That's what that's the answer you were you wanted from me, isn't it?
[1324.48 → 1325.84] Yes, it has hyper threading
[1325.84 → 1328.56] It's better for multitasking, and you avoided it the whole time
[1328.56 → 1336.32] But that's that's all I needed to say to most people and okay, what's hyper threading? Wow
[1339.60 → 1343.76] But it was still sort of helpful
[1346.16 → 1348.96] But the core part actually frustrated me more
[1349.68 → 1355.04] Yeah, they're stupid. Yeah, the eye series has its own huge swath of problems. You know, it's
[1355.04 → 1358.24] really you know, it's the really dumb thing too is like
[1359.44 → 1359.76] I
[1359.76 → 1365.36] Actually because I'm not really an auto person. I actually blamed intel for this crap
[1366.24 → 1368.24] It's BMW
[1370.24 → 1377.76] Three five and seven series. Oh my god. It's all BMW's fault. See I'm a computer person. I thought it was the other way around
[1377.76 → 1379.20] No
[1379.20 → 1382.80] That makes as if BMW would copy intel
[1383.52 → 1387.84] You know the crazy thing is intel used to have like respectable branding
[1389.20 → 1395.68] Yeah, like intel inside yeah people used to like there were kids at my school who were not into computers who had intel inside shirts
[1396.40 → 1400.96] Because like it was a thing and the old intel inside commercials were like very memorable
[1401.68 → 1407.12] Intel inside was huge. Yep, and you still remember the jingle and like there 's
[1407.92 → 1411.20] Even other stuff that I thought they did really well centring
[1411.76 → 1414.32] I thought was a stroke of marketing
[1414.88 → 1420.88] Excellence, maybe not genius, but definitely excellence because what it did was it achieved a sales goal
[1421.28 → 1430.32] So it incentivized laptop manufacturers to buy not just the CPU and chipset, but also the Wi-Fi module from intel
[1430.32 → 1434.00] It improved the state of wireless
[1434.64 → 1441.84] Technology for consumers in general because all of a sudden it made it easy to buy decent Wi-Fi over
[1442.16 → 1444.16] fantastic Wi-Fi that just like
[1444.64 → 1453.84] Basically wasn't going to work it had networking it had a battery life message behind it because it had to include their Bantus core m processor
[1453.84 → 1456.56] Okay
[1456.56 → 1458.56] Yeah, that's fine
[1459.04 → 1463.12] And so it had liked it had this strong technology and
[1463.76 → 1469.28] Sort of quality of life and also sales kind of message. So I like I had to respect it as
[1470.00 → 1474.00] As sort of excellent marketing. Yes, a well-crafted message. Yeah
[1474.72 → 1476.72] But it just it feels like
[1476.80 → 1481.52] They're just struggling, and I have to wonder if maybe part of the problem is that they just don't really have anything new to sell
[1481.52 → 1487.04] More course doesn't okay, so like AMD is like
[1488.16 → 1490.48] Yeah, you what you love so many cores
[1491.84 → 1498.16] We actually don't know what to do with all these cores until inside well AMD outside. It's got too many cores to fit inside
[1501.76 → 1503.76] They should just do that should be their branding
[1503.76 → 1505.76] I actually would love that
[1506.40 → 1508.40] It's like you're going to have cores
[1508.40 → 1509.76] outside the bucket
[1509.76 → 1515.60] I'm in your back pocket. Yeah, too many cores a handle. You're going to need a pickup truck. I can't, I can't carry all these cores
[1515.60 → 1520.08] Yeah, but the CPU is so efficient you can go buy a pickup truck and kill the environment with it
[1520.08 → 1521.76] Keep all your cores in the bed
[1521.76 → 1526.16] Drive around just drive around to work commuting in that pickup truck. You got all your cores in it
[1526.16 → 1532.64] I just want the most Texan person of all time
[1533.36 → 1539.92] To do this video like specifically make sure that they have no idea what a core is and just have them be like super into it
[1540.40 → 1543.36] Cores everywhere you're going to lend all your cores to your friends
[1543.36 → 1546.40] They're never going to give them back. You're not even gonna notice
[1546.40 → 1550.64] You got too many cores it won't even be helpful
[1552.24 → 1553.60] Anyway, the outside
[1553.60 → 1558.08] I don't think them not having something new to sell justifies butchering all their branding
[1558.08 → 1566.96] Yeah, because they if they kept up prop and I know I was crushed when Squarespace changed their branding back in the day from build it beautiful
[1567.52 → 1571.52] Um, or whatever the other one was because there was two that I really liked oh, man
[1572.08 → 1578.80] You and I played off this make it crazy make it something I think, and I would always jump in and say the word. Oh, ah what it was
[1580.80 → 1584.40] I don't remember wow. I don't remember. Yeah, maybe it wasn't that good
[1585.84 → 1590.96] Well, okay, they dropped it pretty quick because they used to switch branding superfast you should
[1590.96 → 1592.96] Yeah
[1596.72 → 1602.88] You should build that was amazing so like thank you, but they change the branding way too fast, and I don't know
[1602.88 → 1605.28] I've never actually thought that was that great of an idea
[1605.52 → 1611.28] Especially if you find one that gloms on really well. Yeah, and like maybe you should only glom on with our audience
[1611.28 → 1616.88] Maybe we were just like yeah, maybe but yeah intel inside was very universal
[1616.88 → 1623.68] I mean that was all over you have to update stuff and I have to confess I didn't like their newer logo
[1624.72 → 1630.88] Until I like went back the other day. I could see them updating the logo though, but I would keep right intel inside
[1631.68 → 1634.56] Intel inside was huge. Do they still use it at all?
[1635.68 → 1636.40] Uh
[1636.56 → 1640.32] Like I think they definitely still protect the trademark. I'm sure
[1641.36 → 1642.80] but like
[1642.80 → 1644.80] Yeah trademarks intel inside
[1644.80 → 1650.32] It's inside. Brand logo mark name online network. This is relatively new branding is
[1650.88 → 1656.48] Yeah, okay, so they still put inside on stuff, but it not doesn't have the same kind of punch
[1657.04 → 1662.40] Here's a sample usage chart. I mean, maybe they just don't emphasize it the way that they used to yeah
[1664.16 → 1666.16] Amazing I
[1666.24 → 1670.16] Always get such a kick out of this. I remember we worked with um
[1670.16 → 1672.16] Um
[1672.16 → 1677.12] Well, I guess it'll never happen again because I'm talking about this now, but we worked with the IOC at one point
[1677.76 → 1678.32] oh
[1678.32 → 1679.52] um
[1679.52 → 1684.88] And the guidelines they have for this kind of stuff are just like they're actually crazy
[1685.52 → 1690.00] Yeah, look at this amazing things start with intel inside is
[1690.64 → 1691.92] correct
[1691.92 → 1694.48] amazing things start with intel inside your pc
[1695.44 → 1695.68] like
[1697.36 → 1699.92] Look for intel inside. Okay. Oh, it's got this
[1700.64 → 1705.04] I was going to say I think that's the problem with that one too. I don't think it's the pc. I think it's
[1706.08 → 1709.36] That intel's the trademark is on intel. I don't know whatever
[1710.16 → 1714.48] They're they're they're not they're not oh shoot. Did we have an echo in the back while I was doing that?
[1714.48 → 1718.80] Oh, my bad. I'm sorry you guys they probably did. Oh, crap. Oh, well
[1720.08 → 1720.88] um
[1720.88 → 1722.88] Welcome to flow plane Unix night
[1722.88 → 1723.60] Yeah
[1723.60 → 1728.32] Well, welcome to the land show everyone where we just complain about intel wrathful. Yeah, every week
[1728.32 → 1732.64] Like do we even have a show today? Is this even a show is anyone gonna watch this? Yep? Yep
[1732.96 → 1736.80] 7500 people watching on YouTube. Yeah, it officially doesn't matter anymore
[1737.36 → 1743.36] Um, lets uh, actually we should probably do our sponsor spots. Holy crap. We started so late today. Oh, yeah
[1743.36 → 1745.36] Uh, spectrum
[1746.80 → 1749.68] Oh, hey, they've got new packaging. I want the vector
[1750.56 → 1755.36] Is this the oh, there's a dry there's a clip on you don't have glasses though, so you don't get the clip on oh
[1756.00 → 1760.96] This is the uh, the blue light blocking. Oh, these look nice our glasses. Yeah, these look actually quite a bit better
[1762.48 → 1769.12] Almost all your driving decisions are based on what you see spectrum's new lumen driving glasses with the l um
[1769.12 → 1775.20] 210 lens claim to make it easier to see road marks stop signs street lights and more to help reduce your risks on the road
[1775.20 → 1778.40] This is actually something that is pretty like well known
[1779.12 → 1784.64] Using a like a yellow tinted lens while you're driving is supposed to increase visibility
[1784.88 → 1787.60] They also block a hundred percent of UVA and UVB rays
[1787.92 → 1791.68] And if you're unsatisfied with your lumen glasses within 30 days, they'll give you a full refund
[1791.68 → 1793.68] No questions asked so go to wanshow10
[1795.84 → 1800.56] Use wanshow10 on their Amazon listing. Oh, we have a coupon to just buy the one Amazon
[1801.28 → 1809.92] That's kind of crazy. And get 10% off your order at leg.GG slash lumen lmg.GG slash lumen
[1810.88 → 1812.88] How do these look?
[1813.44 → 1815.44] Are they a little wide for my face?
[1815.44 → 1818.08] Uh, I'm terrible at that. I think
[1819.12 → 1820.16] barely
[1820.96 → 1822.48] But like maybe not
[1823.20 → 1824.96] I feel like if I had trendier hair
[1825.52 → 1826.72] I could actually rock these
[1827.52 → 1831.36] But my hair is so bad. That was actually another thing that was kind of fun for the 10-year thing
[1831.92 → 1838.48] Like looking at your hair through the ages and the great thing about it is that there was just like not really a clear improvement
[1839.04 → 1841.04] It's just kind of the same
[1841.04 → 1846.72] No, oh, no, there are periods of like truly spectacularly awful like there are dips, but there's not really anything better
[1846.96 → 1850.40] There's just like I have such unpopular opinions about
[1851.36 → 1858.32] Certain things about you. I don't find your voice annoying. I've never seen your hair is a notable problem. Oh, it's a problem. I know apparently
[1858.32 → 1864.24] Yeah, oh, it's like I'm just bad at this objectively a big problem. I don't see it as an issue. You know who else is a sponsor today?
[1864.24 → 1866.24] Humble bundle
[1866.24 → 1871.60] Heck yeah find great deals on amazing games books comics and more at humble bundle
[1871.60 → 1875.84] They believe you should pay for what you want, and they even give you the ability to decide
[1876.40 → 1881.52] How you want to divide your payment between the creators charity and even to humble bundle themselves
[1881.84 → 1889.12] You can either purchase specific titles at their store or through their bundle sets, and they have monthly bundles as a subscription service
[1889.12 → 1893.76] So find out what you could get this month through our partner link leg.GG
[1894.24 → 1897.20] Humble bundle that's pretty cool. I've used humble bundle lots of times me, too
[1897.28 → 1901.36] I've bought a lot of games. I never played. Yeah, but I've also bought some games that I did play
[1901.44 → 1905.68] Yeah, and I didn't pay very much, and it was probably like cheaper as a whole anyway. Yes
[1907.20 → 1911.68] Kind of is the beauty of humble bundle, but they have this like a normal store now, too, which is pretty cool
[1912.08 → 1915.04] Yeah, technically there's a private internet access spot in here
[1915.04 → 1920.48] Heck yeah get private internet access. Yeah, don't have a lot of time. Do it up. Today's show is going to be a little short. We've got a better link than that
[1921.12 → 1923.12] What is it? Leg.GG slash?
[1923.84 → 1925.20] Uh, PIA when
[1925.20 → 1925.68] PIA when
[1925.68 → 1929.84] leg.GG slash PIA when we have to get those things updated. Yeah. Oh, you know what else?
[1929.92 → 1932.08] I really have to update you guys on
[1932.88 → 1934.88] LTX expo
[1934.96 → 1940.40] So we've got a couple of updates. We actually forgot last week to look at the blog. Oh, so there are a couple updates
[1940.40 → 1945.12] Posted by Stephanie Potter ways to get to LTX 2019 extreme hack
[1945.84 → 1950.56] Lots of options if you're flying into Vancouver the closest airport is Vancouver International Airport YVR
[1950.56 → 1957.60] It's in Richmond. Don't worry. It doesn't matter if you plan on staying in Richmond or downtown Vancouver. There's a great there are great public transit options
[1957.92 → 1959.20] It's called the Sky Train
[1959.36 → 1963.28] So there are three lines that branch out from actually very close to where LTX is
[1963.76 → 1968.72] If you are anywhere not on the Sky Train our public transit sucks, and we don't have Uber
[1968.72 → 1972.80] So I would strongly recommend finding a hotel that is near a Sky Train station
[1973.12 → 1980.40] So the waterfront station is about five minutes from the Vancouver Convention Centre walking and pretty much everything can get to waterfront
[1980.96 → 1983.04] If you live locally or plan on renting a car
[1983.04 → 1987.12] There's ample parking located under the east building of the Vancouver Convention Centre
[1987.68 → 1991.84] Uh road tripping to the great white north if you're taking I-5 up from sea from Seattle
[1991.84 → 1995.20] You'll cross into Canada at the Peace Arch border crossing, which is open 24 hours
[1995.20 → 1999.60] These are actually really great tips. You guys are going to want to go check these out over at ltxexpo.com
[1999.60 → 2003.52] And we've got some information about hotel accommodation and options
[2004.64 → 2008.64] Um, yeah, we don't have Lyft or Uber. We cannot make that clear enough
[2008.64 → 2014.48] We do not have ride-share here because the taxicab mafia is still somehow winning. It's its unbelievable
[2015.04 → 2021.36] Taxi will and taxicabs are kind of garbage here, too. Yeah, if you stay in downtown Vancouver
[2021.36 → 2024.88] It's roughly a 20 to 30-minute walk max
[2025.52 → 2029.92] And then there's always taxis or public transit as options. It's a decent city to walk through though
[2030.56 → 2030.96] um
[2032.08 → 2036.32] So there's some four and a half five star for 600 to 800 a night. That's pretty expensive
[2036.88 → 2042.88] If you have the rest of downtown is a bit of a mixed bag ranging from 80 bucks a night for hostels to hotels in the 300 range
[2043.20 → 2044.56] And if you're looking at Airbnb
[2044.56 → 2048.72] There are options from single rooms to full apartments in the 125 to 350 range
[2048.72 → 2052.72] If you don't mind travelling more, or you want to rent a car because you're going to run around and see the city
[2052.72 → 2058.16] Like I know Steve from gamers nexus ended up going to whistler and doing some biking and stuff since he was in town
[2058.16 → 2064.32] Anyway, yeah, you can stay outside the downtown core, and it's quite a bit less expensive
[2064.32 → 2069.28] So like hostels as low as like 50 bucks a night. So, uh, yeah, that's pretty cool
[2069.76 → 2071.76] uh, what Colton?
[2072.24 → 2074.24] It's going to be sick. It's going to be sick
[2074.24 → 2075.60] What are those glasses?
[2075.60 → 2078.64] These are from spectrum. They're they're driving glasses. Oh, they're actually
[2079.44 → 2086.16] You can see so much better on them. I like them. They're actually like tinted kind of like differently than their regular just like blue light filter
[2086.64 → 2089.52] This isn't during the sponsor spot anymore. So I'm gonna I'm going to go into it
[2090.32 → 2093.68] The style of them reminds me very strongly of destiny skins
[2094.32 → 2096.32] Really? Yeah
[2096.32 → 2102.40] They're like gold with the carbon fibre and then other matte black. This is a really sporty very destiny skin style
[2102.40 → 2106.32] This almost looks like an impact resistant like sports goggles to me
[2106.32 → 2110.00] Yeah, this one doesn't this one's more like stylish like I could actually
[2110.56 → 2113.84] Like I could actually see myself like just wearing this when I'm
[2115.60 → 2117.60] I could see you doing something active
[2118.08 → 2123.36] You could see me wearing them. Yeah, you mean literally. Yeah, thanks. Luke. No worries. I got you helpful. Yeah, no problem
[2123.84 → 2125.84] Yeah
[2125.84 → 2127.84] Okay, I like you so much
[2130.80 → 2132.80] Oh, man
[2132.96 → 2134.96] Do we have news?
[2135.12 → 2143.76] Are we gonna talk about any news in other news the oh really was there news in the first place Lenovo might be releasing their folding phone?
[2144.08 → 2148.40] Yeah, the razor name. Oh, that's great
[2149.28 → 2152.96] Seriously, they have to have like all the colours again like chocolate
[2152.96 → 2157.12] So it might be making a comeback as a fifteen hundred dollar foldable phone
[2157.68 → 2160.80] According to the verge well remember the razor wasn't cheap. That's true
[2161.44 → 2163.92] But like wow there was nothing amazing about it
[2164.80 → 2169.36] Though like calm down, you know, I don't think it's going to get any better
[2169.68 → 2175.20] So here's the thing. I think it was for the first time last year global phone unit sales dipped
[2177.04 → 2179.60] Well like they still have executives to pay
[2179.60 → 2181.60] You know
[2184.32 → 2186.32] Yeah, no
[2186.32 → 2187.28] I mean, it's got to go up
[2187.28 → 2188.00] Technically they do
[2188.00 → 2193.84] So we don't know anything about this thing. No screen size. No specs. No. Yeah, really anything
[2193.84 → 2200.16] We just know that it's not the phone in the picture. That's yeah. No, that's the original Motorola razor. Yeah
[2202.00 → 2204.00] So I was hands-on with a foldable phone
[2204.56 → 2210.64] Down at CES. Did you happen to see that video? No, but I've seen many photos of that phone. It was terrible
[2210.72 → 2215.44] Yeah, I kind of assumed. Yeah, I was like it was one of those things where it was kind of like the um
[2216.08 → 2221.68] Yeah, go ahead. No, okay. So question. Is it terrible as in this will always suck?
[2221.92 → 2226.08] Or is it terrible as in like wow, this is a really, really rough year zero
[2226.08 → 2228.08] But I see the future
[2228.08 → 2230.80] It was terrible in that it was
[2231.60 → 2236.40] It's a really rough year zero, but I see the future, but they are going to suck for a while
[2236.40 → 2239.12] Yeah, okay, because here's that's kind of what I was thinking
[2240.08 → 2242.88] You think back to how long it took
[2244.48 → 2251.52] Laptop manufacturers to figure out palm rejection on the touchpad and like not having a VCR inside
[2251.52 → 2256.08] Which is a relatively simple problem
[2256.08 → 2257.92] Yeah, it used to be horrible
[2257.92 → 2261.60] Compared to like a dual-sided
[2262.32 → 2264.16] foldable device where
[2264.80 → 2272.56] You are at times going to be touching the other folded side of the display in the course of your regular operation of it
[2273.20 → 2277.36] Like this is not simple, and it's going to look stupid
[2277.36 → 2283.76] It's stupid if it's not if it doesn't you know have stuff on the back like it's not going to look cool in space age
[2283.76 → 2288.08] It's not gonna work for marketing purposes unless they try to keep the whole display on the whole time
[2289.12 → 2291.12] um
[2291.28 → 2294.88] So there 's's the whole touch rejection thing to get over
[2295.52 → 2296.96] um, there's the fact that
[2297.60 → 2303.76] If that display is anything to go by the quality of the OLED panels themselves
[2303.76 → 2306.00] Might be trash now
[2306.48 → 2310.96] It was bad like I honestly that booth was one of those where
[2311.92 → 2312.56] I
[2312.56 → 2319.04] Wanted to be as nice to them as I could because I was right up in their grills while I'm talking about this product
[2319.04 → 2322.56] Yeah, but I also tried to get my point across that like
[2323.20 → 2324.88] Even though this product is for sale
[2325.52 → 2329.60] Like don't buy it. It's got some issues
[2329.60 → 2335.92] Yeah, as they say the other one that was like that was the VR shoes that I saw while I was down there. Do you see that video?
[2336.64 → 2337.68] Yes, oh man
[2338.56 → 2345.04] Ed liked them. I know but ed's like the more ed likes them until I told him how much they cost how much they cost
[2346.40 → 2348.40] Yes
[2349.52 → 2351.52] Okay, so just for those of you haven't seen the video
[2351.52 → 2356.72] They're VR shoes where you like go like this on the floor or like backwards, and you spin in your chair
[2356.72 → 2360.88] And like you walk in this direction, and then you like to spin in your chair, and you walk in this direction
[2360.88 → 2364.72] But you stay seated the whole time, so my brain like roller balls on the bottom
[2364.96 → 2366.96] It's its effectively
[2367.04 → 2369.04] Ball mouse technology in
[2369.92 → 2374.88] 2019 on your feet. It's not quite ball mouse technology because it's only 2d
[2375.60 → 2377.60] So it's more like scroll wheel technology
[2378.40 → 2379.60] Carry on
[2379.60 → 2385.36] So it's even not as advanced as uh as ball mouse technology in 2019. So it should cost like
[2385.92 → 2388.40] Like 50 bucks a foot, but I'm going to guess
[2389.20 → 2392.08] It's like 300 350 bucks for the set
[2394.00 → 2399.44] And at that price would you consider it to be something worth buying even if you liked it? No, it's 400
[2402.32 → 2403.44] Okay
[2403.44 → 2407.76] Oh the main reason why I would say no, I wouldn't find it because it's going to be
[2407.76 → 2410.08] Good in such a select
[2410.56 → 2414.48] Amount of games because so many games are not going to expect you to have that type of movement
[2415.60 → 2421.36] Doom like they had there I'm very not surprised they picked doom yeah, because it's probably pretty good in doom
[2422.96 → 2426.72] But like I can't imagine if you need to travel for very long distances
[2427.44 → 2430.16] Like if you're in like, uh, oh, yeah, what a pain
[2431.44 → 2435.92] I have to run across this whole freaking map just trying to like to run in my chair the whole damn time
[2435.92 → 2438.16] Like that's I can't imagine that would be good
[2438.64 → 2444.00] Like it's one of those it's one of those things where it's like did joystick waggling with the Wii ever displace
[2444.56 → 2446.24] traditional controllers
[2446.24 → 2448.88] No, because no one actually wants to do that
[2448.88 → 2453.52] And if you're gonna if we're going to play an exercise game then I'm going to play an exercise game not a
[2454.88 → 2458.80] Like shuffling my feet back and forth yeah game like that's not an extra
[2458.80 → 2460.32] There's more entertaining ways to do that
[2460.32 → 2467.04] I finally tried beat safer. Oh, sorry. Go ahead. I I I also partially understand the cost because
[2467.68 → 2469.68] They're going to sell like four of them
[2470.80 → 2475.76] More than that obviously I'm exaggerating by a lot but like they had like eight people on staff in their booth
[2479.76 → 2483.84] Yeah, if it was just like two dudes or something I'd be like yeah you guys can make a go of this
[2483.84 → 2487.60] Hey, you took a trackball and almost, and you put it on people's feet
[2488.64 → 2490.64] How do they're the software work?
[2490.64 → 2492.64] Yeah, yeah, yeah
[2493.28 → 2494.80] Yeah
[2494.80 → 2496.32] Yeah
[2496.32 → 2499.84] In other news, yeah in other news the pi max isn't bad anymore
[2500.72 → 2502.40] Oh, really? Yes
[2502.40 → 2508.56] That's actually surprising. It's very surprising because did you never tried it? No, but I listened to you
[2508.56 → 2515.36] I was really frustrated because there were others like I'm not going to name any names partly because I don't remember what they are
[2515.76 → 2520.48] But I was getting thrown under the bus because there were others like much more credible
[2520.48 → 2524.72] VR enthusiast YouTubers who are focused on VR that were saying that it was amazing
[2525.12 → 2525.76] sure and
[2525.76 → 2533.76] I was sort of the dissenting voice being like no actually this is garbage like they cannot ship this something
[2533.76 → 2536.88] I've been sorry I'm going to cut you off again something I've been thinking about over the last little bit
[2536.88 → 2539.04] It's like a lot of the VR community you think you are Linus
[2541.36 → 2549.12] Cutting people off mid-story so you can interject your own point a lot of the VR community a lot of the hardcore VR community kind of hates us because we're
[2549.92 → 2555.76] Dissenters to a certain degree right um I think the problem is we can't be their champion
[2556.64 → 2556.88] right
[2557.84 → 2561.60] Well, I guess i sort of could now but that's also not my space anymore
[2561.60 → 2566.16] But like Linus tech tips can't be their champion because lion's tech tips is technology review
[2566.88 → 2572.32] Yes, and it's like early on and really rough and like people that are buying them are not using them and like
[2572.96 → 2574.56] Etc, etc, etc. So like
[2575.28 → 2581.84] Gotta keep credibility and be a proper reviewer. It's we can't yeah champion VR. I think we both would like to
[2582.16 → 2587.36] I want it to be better than it is. I want it to do better than it has yeah, and we both wish it the best
[2587.84 → 2589.76] Yes, and are both highly interested in it
[2589.76 → 2593.60] But the thing too is even in the time since VR became a consumer product
[2593.92 → 2594.96] um
[2594.96 → 2599.76] Like with the vibe. I don't mean like there's been VR consumer products before but come on
[2600.64 → 2601.60] virtual boy
[2601.60 → 2602.64] Yeah, um
[2602.72 → 2605.84] Even in that time Linus tech tips has also gotten a lot more mainstream
[2606.40 → 2610.24] In terms of the technology that it covers, but also the perspective
[2610.88 → 2617.28] That I am trying to provide because like I've been I've had my eyes have to be impartial
[2617.28 → 2620.80] It's not it can't just be your view. I've had my eyes kind of opened
[2621.36 → 2624.32] To that there's so much more to the world
[2624.88 → 2626.00] than technology
[2626.64 → 2629.36] Enthusiasts even within people who
[2629.92 → 2632.48] Who love and live and breathe technology?
[2632.96 → 2635.92] Like you know the top interest of my twitter followers is dogs
[2636.48 → 2638.08] Not tech. There you go
[2638.88 → 2640.48] Tech is a very close second
[2641.20 → 2646.80] But dogs is first, but dogs is first um, I mean and here's the thing like even I was uh watching the MHD
[2646.80 → 2653.12] Live stream today, and he said he got rid of the Nazi that I hooked up for him in favour of this jellyfish one
[2653.12 → 2655.04] Because it was like simpler
[2655.92 → 2657.60] and I was like
[2657.60 → 2659.68] Okay, like this is just something that
[2660.48 → 2662.32] You know was hard for me to imagine
[2662.88 → 2663.92] 10 years ago
[2663.92 → 2667.76] Yeah, the theme of today's stream. Yeah, yeah was hard for me to imagine 10 years ago
[2668.48 → 2671.20] but like that even among people who
[2671.20 → 2674.48] Are technology lovers?
[2674.96 → 2676.56] There's sort of this um
[2677.28 → 2681.92] There's this friction when it comes to like working on technology
[2682.40 → 2684.56] It's like noticing why the sensors don't work
[2684.56 → 2690.32] Yeah, you know, etc. Just like there's there's people who would consider themselves into cars
[2691.12 → 2693.04] But who don't change their own oil?
[2693.04 → 2695.36] Yeah, they just like driving them
[2696.00 → 2696.24] um
[2696.96 → 2702.40] So, so anyway like we've we've tried to take on, and it's not it's not always easy for me like sometimes I'll end up
[2702.96 → 2705.20] Needing out over like a header on a motherboard
[2705.92 → 2711.44] And like I I can feel the hundreds of thousands or millions of eyeballs
[2712.00 → 2714.72] Or maybe not eyeballs, but certainly eyebrows just kind of going right
[2715.44 → 2716.56] What um
[2717.44 → 2722.24] But it's something that I've actively tried to do and from a more mainstream perspective
[2724.00 → 2728.80] VR is not very interesting like I got I had um Yvonne try beat safer last night
[2729.20 → 2731.68] Because I've been I've been having a blast in it. This is really cool
[2732.40 → 2736.64] I had her try it last night, and she played for seven minutes and was like
[2738.16 → 2739.28] Yeah, I'm feeling a little sick
[2739.28 → 2743.60] I'm tired of having something on my face and went back to like browsing Facebook on her phone and
[2744.88 → 2748.88] That's not because she like the elvish wasn't good at it or something. It's because
[2749.52 → 2756.48] VR just has like a really long way to go and has some real actual obstacles that I'm sorry
[2757.12 → 2759.44] Will make it not mainstream
[2760.08 → 2765.04] Period like the fact that you need all this space lots of people don't have space
[2765.04 → 2765.52] Yeah
[2765.52 → 2772.16] Like even if they did have the money and so people will get mad people will not like it, but we got to stand by
[2773.12 → 2776.08] The stuff my man we can't be the champions for that
[2776.08 → 2782.72] I don't I don't agree with a lot of the VR community's defences of VR. I love it
[2783.12 → 2786.16] I've actually I've been using I've been using my vibe more than
[2787.36 → 2790.00] For the last little I've been using actually quite a lot lately
[2790.00 → 2792.08] I've been using it like at least every other night for the past week
[2792.08 → 2796.56] I wouldn't punch my ceiling and beat safer. I would probably be using it all the time as well
[2797.04 → 2797.92] um
[2797.92 → 2803.84] It's its very cool, but we can't put our own opinions too heavily into the wall
[2803.84 → 2805.20] Okay, again, I don't do this anymore
[2805.20 → 2808.96] But line of psych tips can't put their own opinions too heavily into this kind of stuff
[2808.96 → 2812.64] I mean, I can include it. I just can't like that can't be the conclusion of the review
[2812.64 → 2815.20] I can't just be a champion for it. Yeah, just in spite of
[2815.84 → 2821.76] Whatever's in front of my face. Yeah, um speaking of champion beat safer not saver
[2821.76 → 2823.76] Facebook
[2825.76 → 2827.12] Full champion wait, what is this?
[2828.32 → 2834.88] Is that this is not the right? This is not the right thing. Oh, interesting apparently Facebook is investing into news partnerships over the next three years
[2835.76 → 2837.84] I guess they don't want to elect trump again, huh?
[2839.28 → 2844.08] That's fascinating. Oh, oh speak. Oh, there was like uh, there was like some like
[2844.88 → 2849.52] Meme thing that I had wanted to lol. It's a tech crunch article down. Yeah, no, no
[2849.52 → 2852.24] I was looking for a different thing now. I'm over that one. Okay, uh
[2852.96 → 2853.52] um
[2853.52 → 2854.96] Oh
[2854.96 → 2859.68] You know what? I really want to talk about sure forget it. I don't feel like talking about that. Okay, um
[2860.72 → 2862.40] so I
[2862.40 → 2867.44] Hooked my oh, yeah phone the title of the stream. Yeah, yeah, um
[2867.44 → 2871.36] Um, I'd like to know before I sort of explain why
[2872.48 → 2873.52] What's your gut reaction?
[2874.56 → 2877.76] He's six. He's six. He's six. Um
[2880.80 → 2881.44] I'm not
[2882.48 → 2885.44] I'm not a father. I don't intend in being a father. That's fine. It doesn't matter
[2885.44 → 2888.88] But you can still judge everyone judges internet scares the heck out of me
[2889.60 → 2890.80] To be completely honest
[2890.80 → 2892.96] So part of the big part of the problem too is
[2893.52 → 2897.52] I feel like when I was growing up the internet was a little bit more
[2898.48 → 2900.16] Divided there was like
[2900.80 → 2905.84] Porn sites and then there was the rest of the internet it was a little harder to find the porn sites
[2905.84 → 2907.84] It was a little harder to find them
[2907.92 → 2912.64] And like mainstream websites didn't effectively have it all over the place
[2912.64 → 2916.24] Yeah, or at least at the very least extremely sexualized content
[2916.24 → 2920.48] Where it's like maybe there isn't nudity, but we all know why you're here
[2921.36 → 2927.20] That's everywhere now. Yep, and the rest there are tons of other stuff on the internet that scares the hell out of me, too
[2927.20 → 2930.08] In terms of a very impressionable small child
[2930.96 → 2932.40] That scares me. Yeah
[2933.12 → 2937.20] If it was just a call and texting plan situation
[2938.64 → 2939.12] Uh
[2941.12 → 2942.64] Sounds like maybe a good idea
[2943.68 → 2945.20] But the internet scares me
[2946.56 → 2948.48] That is a very interesting perspective
[2949.36 → 2950.72] Here's an alternate look
[2950.72 → 2950.96] So
[2951.84 → 2954.08] My wife and I are Yvonne I guess most of you know her name
[2954.08 → 2955.84] So we actually talked about it a fair bit
[2955.84 → 2957.20] So one of the reasons that
[2957.20 → 2958.56] Okay, sorry, I want to throw another
[2958.56 → 2959.36] Yeah, sure
[2960.08 → 2963.20] But there's other obviously positive parts of the internet as well
[2963.20 → 2964.32] He could share location
[2966.00 → 2967.52] If for some reason he's ever lost
[2967.52 → 2968.16] Automatically
[2968.16 → 2968.88] Automatically
[2968.88 → 2970.80] Believe it or not, I can just check his location right now
[2970.80 → 2972.24] Yeah, oh see like that's cool
[2972.24 → 2972.64] Yep
[2972.64 → 2973.52] Um and like
[2973.52 → 2973.84] Where he is
[2973.84 → 2976.00] Like that kind of stuff is oh yeah, let's not
[2976.64 → 2977.68] No, I'm not going to show it
[2977.68 → 2977.84] Yeah
[2977.84 → 2979.68] I was just making sure sometimes
[2979.68 → 2980.08] There you go
[2980.08 → 2980.88] It's leaked on stream
[2980.88 → 2982.16] Updated 11 minutes ago
[2982.16 → 2983.12] That's super cool
[2983.12 → 2984.40] That's exactly where he's supposed to be right now
[2984.40 → 2985.76] Yeah, and like that's awesome
[2985.76 → 2987.52] Huge amount of peace of mind
[2987.52 → 2987.68] Yep
[2987.68 → 2988.16] Like it's just
[2988.16 → 2990.08] So there's the great part
[2990.08 → 2992.72] And there's the that's scary kind of part
[2992.72 → 2996.96] But overall I don't think it's a negative thing that you give him a phone
[2996.96 → 2997.60] So
[2997.60 → 2999.52] I would not judge it that way
[2999.52 → 3005.76] I was convinced that my kids probably weren't going to get a phone until around the time that I did
[3005.76 → 3008.32] Which was when I turned 16 if I recall correctly
[3008.32 → 3009.04] Okay
[3009.04 → 3015.36] Which admittedly was probably pretty old-fashioned
[3015.36 → 3022.88] Like yeah when the newsletter came home when he started school like real school not preschool when he started school and the newsletter came home with like a cell phones policy
[3023.28 → 3025.12] I was like what this elementary school
[3025.60 → 3027.36] What do any of these kids have cell phones for?
[3029.52 → 3036.48] So the thing that made me come around to just approaching the idea and that sort of opened up the discussion with the wife
[3037.04 → 3040.72] Was that I'm gonna start taking him with me when I sometimes travel
[3041.28 → 3041.36] Okay
[3041.36 → 3045.76] Just so that we get to spend a little bit more time together when daddy's travelling
[3045.76 → 3047.84] That's cool because you travel a lot
[3047.84 → 3048.88] Um, that's cool
[3048.88 → 3052.00] Yeah, so I want to start taking him with me and if for whatever reason
[3052.80 → 3055.68] We got split up in an airport or whatever
[3056.64 → 3057.44] I just
[3057.60 → 3059.28] I want him to have a phone like period
[3060.08 → 3064.00] Because there's like it's hilarious like if my phone battery is dead or whatever else
[3064.00 → 3069.76] Um, I this must have been a couple of months ago. I was running around the superstore trying to find
[3070.40 → 3070.64] um
[3071.60 → 3073.68] Yvonne and the kids because they were shopping
[3074.32 → 3079.60] And I was doing a thing that I used to do where I would walk down the entire thing
[3080.32 → 3086.16] Looking down every aisle to figure out where they are, and you can still miss people because they could be like in between aisles
[3086.16 → 3088.88] As you or as you pass through or whatever else, and I was like
[3088.88 → 3093.52] It has been so long since I've done this because if I ever don't know where Yvonne is
[3095.20 → 3098.40] And then I find out yeah, and so I was like okay just for the sake of
[3099.36 → 3102.64] Location I'd like to know where he is sure
[3104.08 → 3104.48] Also
[3105.12 → 3110.56] A really cool and interesting side effect has been that I have ended up talking to him more
[3111.52 → 3114.80] Something about text communication especially while I've been travelling
[3114.80 → 3118.00] So he actually texts me all the time
[3118.56 → 3123.12] Okay, that's cool and without his own means of communicating with me
[3124.32 → 3125.76] How was he supposed to do that?
[3127.12 → 3130.88] Yeah, and it's not like I don't still talk to him in person when we're in the same room
[3131.60 → 3132.32] but
[3132.32 → 3133.28] you know if he's
[3134.16 → 3139.92] On his way to skating lessons or something he'll just text me and be like on my way to skating lessons going to have fun
[3139.92 → 3143.60] Hope your day is okay. That's pretty freaking cute. Oh
[3144.16 → 3148.16] Oh Geez all right, and it's pretty it's pretty neat because you know, I can
[3149.12 → 3153.04] You know text back be safe and all that stuff let me know how it went
[3153.52 → 3158.56] Uh, you know send me a picture of they were working on this homegrown crystal kit thing while I was at CES
[3159.20 → 3165.04] Like hey send me a picture of the crystals and like it's really fun. It's interactive. It's all the reasons that we like
[3165.68 → 3169.44] Text communication why it's completely taken over the world super wholesome
[3169.44 → 3173.36] Um, another thing is we have put all of his relatives in his phone book
[3173.84 → 3179.60] So he's just like staying in touch with his family in a way that I just didn't do when I
[3180.24 → 3184.72] Didn't have my own you couldn't way of communicating because all that you had was the landline
[3184.72 → 3187.52] Which when I was a kid you shared with your internet connection, too
[3188.80 → 3195.52] We'd be playing games dude, which was lame. Yeah, um, no games were cool, but having them shared
[3195.52 → 3197.20] Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, I agree. Um
[3197.84 → 3199.76] Now in response to the internet
[3200.56 → 3204.80] I will say this because of who he is specifically
[3205.84 → 3207.84] I'm not that worried about it
[3207.84 → 3214.64] If I say don't go to any website other than the websites that I say hey, I can whitelist sites like I can actually go that Draconian if I need to
[3215.44 → 3217.44] Um, but if I say
[3217.60 → 3222.56] Don't go to any websites other than these. He actually wouldn't now that might change as he gets older
[3223.20 → 3224.56] He might get a little more defiant
[3224.56 → 3229.92] A little devious. Um, but I mean there's other stuff too. There's actually no way I tried to override it
[3229.92 → 3234.24] I cannot there's no way to install a full YouTube app on a Google kids account
[3235.12 → 3237.12] Oh, so he cannot watch my videos
[3241.12 → 3242.96] This is what I was going to say though is like even
[3243.76 → 3246.64] Really mainstream sites like YouTube
[3246.64 → 3252.32] There's stuff on it. That's like, your know can't get to YouTube
[3252.72 → 3253.84] Okay, yeah, like
[3254.72 → 3256.64] I'm assuming twitch is bundled in with that
[3256.64 → 3261.28] Uh, well, he can't install an app without it pinging me to approve it
[3261.28 → 3264.72] But it couldn't, you just go to the website like YouTube's uh, no, I doubt it
[3265.28 → 3268.88] Okay, I can I don't know anything about the kids. I can double-check that
[3269.36 → 3272.96] But I'm I'm not that worried about that. I think it's very unlikely
[3273.60 → 3280.24] Um, the other thing too is I get a report of what apps he's in what his web browsing history is how long he's been in the apps
[3280.24 → 3282.16] Yeah, screen time I can do it day by day
[3282.72 → 3287.44] So he's spending some time in WhatsApp and apparently someone let him watch Netflix today for half an hour
[3288.08 → 3290.08] um
[3290.72 → 3292.56] I can just like lock it
[3292.56 → 3294.00] I can just lock him out of it
[3294.00 → 3296.88] I can set the hours of day that he's allowed to access it and
[3297.76 → 3301.52] I don't know it's uh, it's one of those things where it's actually been really cool to see him
[3302.16 → 3304.16] Learning how to communicate
[3304.48 → 3309.04] Digitally because there's stuff that there's like texting etiquette things that I kind of take for granted
[3309.04 → 3313.68] Like it's adorable. He feels like he has to reply to every message
[3314.80 → 3316.00] Do you remember that?
[3316.00 → 3317.44] Yeah, it's just like okay
[3318.24 → 3319.84] Cool, I was
[3320.48 → 3322.64] Someone brought up a RuneScape the other day and I brought up that
[3323.20 → 3326.40] I used to have such a hard time playing that game because it was the first MMO style game
[3326.40 → 3330.72] I played and every single time I'd walk past anyone all communication then was speech bubble above your head
[3330.72 → 3334.16] Yes, so every single speech bubble I saw I thought they're talking to me
[3334.16 → 3341.12] So I would like walk up to two random people having conversation to start replying out of nowhere. I was like that was that person
[3344.80 → 3347.84] If only we remembered how insufferable we were
[3348.80 → 3351.76] We'd understand why gamers hate kids so much. Yeah, pretty much
[3352.48 → 3354.56] For me, I'm like, yeah, yeah, I think we might get to give a deal
[3354.96 → 3358.72] But then like I remember what a little like okay, so uh, Diablo one
[3359.36 → 3360.32] um
[3360.32 → 3367.12] Not realizing that there was no godly plate of the whale that was purely a trainered item
[3368.08 → 3372.80] I tried to convince someone that mine was legit at some point, and they're just like
[3374.16 → 3380.64] Look, the server says no trainers no hackers get out of here. I'm like no, no no this is real. It's mine. It's mine
[3381.76 → 3384.16] There was that was not a real item like
[3387.04 → 3389.04] So dumb
[3389.04 → 3396.56] Anyway, oh, so I did it I'm really happy that it's been a positive experience because to me that would be a pretty scary thing
[3397.04 → 3397.28] Yeah
[3398.80 → 3403.12] That's cool. I intend to keep an eye on it. I don't think he's even opened a web browser yet
[3403.28 → 3407.52] It hasn't even occurred to him. Uh, he mostly just uses it to oh, no
[3407.52 → 3411.52] I know when he watched Netflix he watched it this morning before school because I didn't feel like getting up yet
[3411.52 → 3413.52] Yeah, that was my bad
[3413.92 → 3420.80] Um, he mostly uses it to WhatsApp his relatives, which I think is pretty good. That seems pretty wholesome. Yeah. Yeah
[3421.76 → 3427.20] Um, so I think that's pretty much it for wan show. We'll see you guys again next week same bat time same bat channel
[3427.68 → 3432.88] That was a wild show and yeah, like we didn't even play the intro. Oh wow, we didn't you know what?
[3433.20 → 3438.48] Let's do it now outro. Oh, wait. Oh, we should really do some super chats. Hey, not a bad idea
[3438.80 → 3443.12] Uh, also, yeah, there are still tons of questions coming through holy crap
[3443.68 → 3445.04] Go to my twitch after this
[3445.92 → 3449.76] I don't know how to pronounce this name or what 300 rubles is
[3450.72 → 3454.24] And the message is hey there Linus and Luke. I bet you can't read my name
[3454.24 → 3456.24] Without asking Ivan to help
[3456.24 → 3456.88] Holy crap
[3456.88 → 3458.88] Uh, go to my twitch after this
[3460.08 → 3460.88] Why did that happen?
[3462.80 → 3463.92] What even just
[3464.80 → 3465.76] Even what?
[3466.48 → 3468.88] Okay, uh, yeah
[3469.60 → 3471.12] Uh cheapo, hi
[3471.84 → 3473.36] Hey, Aaron, hi
[3474.00 → 3475.44] Kazan, hi
[3475.44 → 3476.08] Coffeyville
[3476.96 → 3480.80] Cheese monkey got it. Uh max Ltd VIP tickets
[3480.80 → 3485.44] I want to book hotel and flight in advance, but when will the VIP meetup take place last year?
[3485.44 → 3487.84] It was a day before we'll be at this be it will be at the same this year
[3488.48 → 3492.96] Not sure uh stay tuned. Oh, crap. That might be a bit of a problem
[3493.60 → 3498.00] Um, because VIP tickets there's not going to be a ton of them. We really like we don't
[3498.72 → 3501.12] We don't want there to be a ton of them
[3501.92 → 3502.48] uh
[3503.68 → 3506.40] Oh, man, you're probably going to have to fade those phase those out eventually
[3506.72 → 3509.28] Yeah, I don't know what to do because I hate how expensive they are
[3509.28 → 3512.32] But if we don't make them expensive they sell out in like 30 seconds. Yeah
[3513.12 → 3516.48] Uh, yeah max I'm sorry. I don't have a
[3516.96 → 3520.00] A solid I don't have a solid answer for you yet
[3520.88 → 3522.88] um
[3523.04 → 3525.92] Red slash ace how much is a booth at Ltd?
[3526.96 → 3529.84] Interested in showing off a smell device for gaming
[3530.48 → 3534.16] Uh, I have no idea. Uh, you'd have to reach out to Colton
[3535.12 → 3539.20] Linus tech tips at gmail.com. That sounds like a fun interactive. That actually does sound pretty fun
[3539.28 → 3544.16] Yeah, David. Uh, hey, there's something I really want to say to you how you literally saved my life
[3544.64 → 3550.24] But I don't have enough money to fit in a super chat. So I'm putting it as a two-part message in float plane chat
[3551.52 → 3555.20] My float plane username is David. Okay. Do you want to find that?
[3555.92 → 3559.28] Uh, uh, thanks, dude. I don't know when he sent it though
[3560.32 → 3565.68] Uh, Jake says why is every aspect of a computer in metric, but storage is imperial two and a half inch drives?
[3565.68 → 3572.48] You know what? I wish I could answer that question. Uh screen sizes also for the most part in uh
[3573.12 → 3578.32] In imperial I know some places do them in centimetres, but uh imperial is a little bit more common
[3579.20 → 3584.32] Uh, Aaron I've been watching since you unbox those enelute batteries. Yeah. Oh boy
[3585.84 → 3587.84] Yeah, that video is fantastic
[3588.48 → 3595.20] Uh Adam says I can't access float plane so jokes on me Luke. Wait what uh you should email. Oh, float plane has a new support email
[3595.20 → 3600.80] Yeah, it's support at float plane.com. Yeah, you should way more simple. Yeah, it's like not stupid now
[3601.20 → 3603.20] Yeah, EPOS Vox sends a heart
[3604.16 → 3609.92] Yeah, hey, uh, yeah, I still need to call you. Sorry, uh, lactose says
[3610.48 → 3612.48] uh, I'm not reading that
[3613.92 → 3623.84] That's very inappropriate. Um, we don't we don't talk about p on this show. Yeah, uh, lewis says please cheer for an person burning the midnight oil migrating an oracle database
[3624.48 → 3627.60] Heck yeah cheers to you brother. Uh, good luck
[3629.52 → 3635.92] How much to get you two to floss asks lactose Larry. I can't, I can't floss. I actually tried. You don't know how to do it?
[3636.00 → 3637.84] Wait, is this dead? It's not hard
[3638.96 → 3643.20] Uh, no, it seems to be working. Mine's not. I don't know what's going on with your laptop. Well, I just like don't really get it
[3643.20 → 3647.44] I think it's supposed to be like well, you don't really do it while you're sitting. Yeah, I know, but I just
[3648.16 → 3650.16] Okay, you know what will you do it?
[3652.00 → 3653.20] He sent a hundred dollars
[3653.76 → 3657.04] U.S. dollars? Yeah, but he asked how much
[3657.92 → 3661.92] So that was technically just for the question. All you're going to answer for a hundred dollars is how much?
[3661.92 → 3666.16] Just for the question. You wouldn't dance monkey dance for a hundred dollars. And it's not your hundred dollars mind you
[3666.16 → 3671.12] So I can understand this. Yeah, tell you what I'll try, but I'm I'll go along with you
[3671.12 → 3675.84] I don't know if I remember anymore. Okay, so where do they start here?
[3675.84 → 3682.24] Your hips have to go your hips have to go opposite though. Okay, and then and then this arm goes behind you
[3683.28 → 3688.16] And then back out and then out and then this way and this way this
[3689.52 → 3691.20] I'm sorry. I did that. Okay. Yeah
[3693.92 → 3696.00] I think that's how you do it honestly
[3696.00 → 3701.60] I've never seen a tutorial video, and I've never actually watched the dance. I just assume that's how it goes
[3702.16 → 3709.74] Lactose Larry actually continued to send money. Was I wrong? Lactose Larry spent four hundred dollars getting us to floss
[3710.18 → 3712.18] We would have done it for the first hundred
[3715.02 → 3716.18] Hey
[3716.18 → 3720.70] It worked. All right. Well, thank you guys for tuning in. We'll see you again next week
[3720.70 → 3724.08] I think we're really done now. I don't even know if we did it right or not. It's over. Okay
[3726.00 → 3728.00] I don't know if we did it right or not
[3729.20 → 3731.20] Report it
[3734.96 → 3740.16] Daniel says this is the single most epic land show I have ever watched. It was such a train wreck
[3742.32 → 3745.52] Oh apparently there's no audio in to inter- I don't even know what's going on
[3748.24 → 3750.24] Terrible Friday
