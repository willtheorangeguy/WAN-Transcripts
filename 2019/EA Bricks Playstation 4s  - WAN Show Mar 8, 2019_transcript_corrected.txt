[0.00 → 2.00] We're live again!
[2.00 → 4.00] There we go! That took a while!
[4.00 → 9.00] Yeah, I only went offline like 10–15 minutes ago.
[9.00 → 16.00] I showed up at the office and checked my phone and saw that you just went live and was like,
[16.00 → 20.00] What? When is Sancho gonna start?
[20.00 → 22.00] Am I really late?
[22.00 → 29.00] Either I'm really late or the Sancho's going to be starting at like 8 or something.
[29.00 → 31.00] No, so I just, you know, I made it.
[31.00 → 33.00] What did you even do?
[33.00 → 35.00] So, okay.
[35.00 → 36.00] You didn't stream for very long.
[36.00 → 40.00] You know what? Actually, I should, hey Alex, are you still over there?
[41.00 → 47.00] No? Is anyone over there? Jake? Who? Jake?
[47.00 → 52.00] Hey Jake, can you actually grab the network switch from the camera den?
[52.00 → 56.00] I've seen this! That's really cool!
[56.00 → 59.00] That's got to be extremely unnecessary.
[60.00 → 62.00] Is that right?
[62.00 → 63.00] Is that right?
[63.00 → 64.00] Oh yeah.
[64.00 → 65.00] It was just for fun? Yeah, okay.
[65.00 → 67.00] I was like, how did you possibly have that as a...
[67.00 → 73.00] So, okay. So we were working on one of the coolest projects that we've done in a really, really long time.
[73.00 → 74.00] It looks beautiful.
[74.00 → 77.00] It went way over time and way over budget.
[77.00 → 84.00] And basically, it cost us, our goal this week was seven LTT videos, because we're trying to queue up some extra for me to go on vacation.
[84.00 → 85.00] Okay.
[85.00 → 93.00] So our goal was seven LTT videos. We ended up with four, because we were very busy doing this project.
[93.00 → 104.00] And it was more complicated than we hoped and or expected. But the end result is so cool. And the reason that we did it was ultimately...
[104.00 → 107.00] Wow, my hair is spectacularly bad today. Whatever.
[107.00 → 111.00] The reason that we did it is not because we had to...
[111.00 → 113.00] Oh my god!
[113.00 → 114.00] Oh my god!
[114.00 → 117.00] Is not because we had to, but rather...
[117.00 → 118.00] I know, I'm doing it on purpose.
[118.00 → 119.00] Okay, okay.
[119.00 → 121.00] I'm kind of... I'm concealing it a little bit.
[121.00 → 122.00] Yeah.
[122.00 → 134.00] But because we wanted to get some practice creating custom water cooling solutions, because we want to ultimately water cool a RED 8K camera.
[134.00 → 135.00] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[135.00 → 142.00] And we figured, let's start on something a little bit smaller. And the purpose of starting on this, a network switch is a single board.
[142.00 → 145.00] I thought you made it so much taller.
[145.00 → 150.00] Yeah. Okay, so a network switch is a single board.
[150.00 → 155.00] So it was a matter of just working on like one flat surface. So taking the measurements was quite a bit easier.
[155.00 → 156.00] Yeah.
[156.00 → 164.00] It actually does have a function. Like the reason that we did it this way was because we wanted to quiet it down.
[164.00 → 165.00] Okay.
[165.00 → 166.00] Because it's in the camera den.
[166.00 → 167.00] Ohhhh!
[167.00 → 168.00] And this is a 10 gig switch.
[168.00 → 173.00] Because for all their ingest stations and card wiping stations and all that stuff.
[173.00 → 174.00] Okay.
[174.00 → 176.00] They actually need high-speed networking.
[176.00 → 179.00] I thought this was going into the rack. So when I saw the increased height, I was like, what?
[179.00 → 180.00] No.
[180.00 → 184.00] No, this got pulled from the rack when we got our new Dell 48 port switches.
[184.00 → 185.00] Oh, okay. Sweet.
[185.00 → 186.00] Yes.
[186.00 → 187.00] Yeah.
[187.00 → 196.00] So, by the way, if anyone from float plane is going to come and fix our networking, we know that we don't have a proper router right now and all that kind of stuff for our new 10 gig connection.
[196.00 → 197.00] I know AJ's watching.
[197.00 → 209.00] They need to know that we have two Dell 48 port managed switches. Like really nice switches. And we were told that we could probably use those switches for a lot of router functionality.
[209.00 → 210.00] Okay.
[210.00 → 216.00] Um, this is interesting. The water is warm. Ooh, I wonder if we need a beefier fan on here.
[216.00 → 217.00] Oh, wow.
[217.00 → 218.00] Look at those tubes.
[218.00 → 220.00] And that's like, it's still warm.
[220.00 → 236.00] Um, this thing kicks off more heat than we probably expected. You know, the funny thing is we actually swapped this radiator out for, uh, or we swapped a thicker one out for this one thinking that we wouldn't really need that much rad, but, uh, we might need more radiator.
[236.00 → 237.00] Interesting.
[237.00 → 238.00] Pretty warm.
[238.00 → 241.00] Yeah, that's, that's, that's toasty. That's fine. We can, we can solve that.
[241.00 → 242.00] Toasty.
[242.00 → 243.00] Um, anyway.
[243.00 → 245.00] Why, okay, if I can interject for a second. Why America?
[245.00 → 246.00] Yeah.
[246.00 → 252.00] Uh, so this was the tubing scraps that we had on hand that happened to be the length that, um, those runs were.
[252.00 → 253.00] Okay.
[253.00 → 256.00] So no, there was no, uh, there was no, like, America router.
[256.00 → 260.00] So this one, this one's a little hard to see on camera, but there's a blue one right there.
[260.00 → 261.00] There's also the radiator's blue too.
[261.00 → 262.00] Yeah.
[262.00 → 263.00] Yeah.
[263.00 → 265.00] You know, yeah, no, that wasn't, that wasn't intentional.
[265.00 → 266.00] Okay.
[266.00 → 272.00] Um, but yeah, so anyway, if someone from float plane is planning to come over, just let them know, uh, we have new switches.
[272.00 → 275.00] I know AJ has wanted to help you with networking stuff for a long time.
[275.00 → 283.00] And if, and I know that, um, you know, sometimes like, uh, VLAN tagging and stuff doesn't necessarily cooperate properly between different vendors.
[283.00 → 284.00] Okay.
[284.00 → 290.00] So we would want us, we would want, if we're going to get a new router, we would want a router that will cooperate with our Dell switches.
[290.00 → 291.00] Those Dell man switches.
[291.00 → 293.00] Because those we are, we are sticking with.
[293.00 → 294.00] Okay.
[294.00 → 297.00] They were like a total of eight grand or something like that for the two of them.
[297.00 → 298.00] Okay.
[298.00 → 301.00] But like, that's fine because we're talking 96 ports of 10 gig networking.
[301.00 → 302.00] Yeah.
[302.00 → 305.00] Six, uh, excuse me, 12 ports of 40 gig networking.
[305.00 → 306.00] Jeez.
[306.00 → 308.00] Like that's more than we could need for quite some time.
[308.00 → 310.00] Um, so we're, we're sticking with that anyway.
[310.00 → 314.00] So the purpose of this was to quiet it down because it's in a place where people have to work.
[314.00 → 318.00] And this is like a server rack style switch.
[318.00 → 319.00] Yeah.
[319.00 → 320.00] This is not a this is not a desktop switch.
[320.00 → 321.00] It was quite loud.
[321.00 → 327.00] Um, also, you know, to practice, you know, practice makes perfect.
[327.00 → 330.00] And, um, also just cause like, it was fun.
[330.00 → 332.00] Like I don't, not that I'm aware of.
[332.00 → 335.00] I don't think anybody has ever done this before.
[335.00 → 337.00] Maybe for a good reason.
[337.00 → 341.00] Maybe not because the project overall was a smash success.
[341.00 → 343.00] Like it was a huge success.
[343.00 → 345.00] So we filtered the intakes.
[345.00 → 348.00] You can actually see that you can't really see through them anymore.
[348.00 → 349.00] Yeah.
[349.00 → 354.00] So I put, um, like dust filters on all the intakes, and then we're using our fan here as an exhaust.
[354.00 → 358.00] So we're pulling fresh air in through the sides and exhausting it out the top.
[358.00 → 359.00] Cool.
[359.00 → 360.00] Yeah.
[360.00 → 363.00] So all we might have to do is tune the fan RPM a little bit.
[363.00 → 365.00] I was going to say you might, might be interesting.
[365.00 → 366.00] You know what?
[366.00 → 367.00] I bet it's on purpose.
[367.00 → 368.00] Yes.
[368.00 → 374.00] So the stock fans are PWM controlled and probably temperature sensing.
[374.00 → 380.00] And we're probably so far below the temperature threshold that it's barely turning the bloody thing.
[381.00 → 382.00] Okay.
[383.00 → 389.00] Cause yeah, when we first fired it up, we were seeing anywhere from a 10 to 25 degree reduction in temperature.
[389.00 → 390.00] Wow.
[390.00 → 391.00] Depending on the sensor location.
[391.00 → 392.00] Yeah.
[392.00 → 394.00] So, um, you know what?
[394.00 → 395.00] I bet that's it.
[395.00 → 396.00] Boy, it's heavy now.
[396.00 → 397.00] Here, actually feel this.
[397.00 → 398.00] Holy crap.
[398.00 → 399.00] There's a bit of water in it.
[399.00 → 402.00] That's a little bit heavier than you'd expect a switch to be.
[402.00 → 403.00] No, I don't.
[403.00 → 406.00] Oh, like, uh, oh, I don't know.
[406.00 → 407.00] Maybe.
[407.00 → 408.00] No, no, I don't.
[408.00 → 409.00] Sorry.
[409.00 → 410.00] Um, it was a John.
[410.00 → 412.00] I fix the kit here, but it's gone.
[412.00 → 413.00] Yeah.
[413.00 → 414.00] It seems to have been moved.
[414.00 → 418.00] Um, anyway, so that, that project pushed us a little bit behind schedule this week, but
[418.00 → 424.00] like, honestly, you know, those are the kinds of things that are so much fun for us to do
[424.00 → 425.00] that.
[425.00 → 429.00] It's just like, if we can't, if we can't do those kinds of things, then why even, why even
[429.00 → 431.00] bother anymore?
[431.00 → 435.00] Like, honestly, honestly, like, it's not like.
[435.00 → 436.00] Uh, so, technotainment.
[436.00 → 446.00] So, it's a hilarious thing because people often refer to me as a sellout, but I started
[446.00 → 449.00] out making videos for the money.
[449.00 → 450.00] Yeah.
[450.00 → 455.00] And then over time, it's actually like, I had no experience either behind.
[455.00 → 457.00] Most people do these days.
[457.00 → 462.00] I, anyway, look, I'm not talking about anyone else other than myself.
[462.00 → 469.00] So, over time, so I had no experience in front of or behind a camera, no experience video
[469.00 → 470.00] editing, Nada.
[470.00 → 476.00] And my boss told me to start a YouTube channel and then paid me to run it.
[476.00 → 483.00] And over time, I've actually grown into enjoying the creative aspects of it.
[483.00 → 486.00] So, I'm actually on sort of this reverse journey.
[486.00 → 487.00] Yeah.
[487.00 → 491.00] Um, and it's, I just, I always kind of get a kick out of it because like on the one hand,
[491.00 → 496.00] yes, just like I always have been, I am running a business here.
[496.00 → 498.00] Of course.
[498.00 → 502.00] But, one of the things, I had a really great conversation.
[502.00 → 507.00] I'm not going to name their names just cause like I don't know sort of how, how they would
[507.00 → 508.00] feel about it.
[508.00 → 509.00] It's always better to know.
[509.00 → 511.00] It was a one-on-one conversation with someone.
[511.00 → 515.00] And, um, you know, they basically said that they get asked a lot, why do you still work
[515.00 → 516.00] there?
[516.00 → 523.00] Like, you know, compared to sort of, you know, anything else you could do, you know, you could,
[523.00 → 524.00] like you could work anywhere.
[524.00 → 526.00] Like, why do you still work there exactly?
[526.00 → 531.00] And they basically said, well, you know, I trust the vision.
[531.00 → 538.00] And the vision might not be as artistic as, you know, I might desire, you know, for myself.
[538.00 → 554.00] But, the path that I've seen us follow is build a solid foundation for the business first, which gives you the time and resources and the team and the equipment and the facilities that you need to be an artist.
[554.00 → 561.00] And it's like, totally the opposite way that I think most people go about like a film career.
[561.00 → 568.00] It's not a very common, uh, it's not a very common direction in modern times, I guess.
[568.00 → 571.00] It's really popular for people to job hop like crazy.
[571.00 → 572.00] Right.
[572.00 → 576.00] Not, not as popular for people to try to grow things.
[576.00 → 578.00] I think I 100% know who you're talking about.
[578.00 → 579.00] And that's actually really cool.
[579.00 → 583.00] Um, what was I going to say?
[583.00 → 584.00] Yeah, I know.
[584.00 → 586.00] And it, it, it, it makes sense.
[586.00 → 589.00] I, there's a certain line too, right?
[589.00 → 591.00] Like there are certain things that you don't do.
[591.00 → 597.00] Um, there are certain offers that, that line of shoots down or Nick shoots down or Colton shoots down.
[597.00 → 598.00] Most of them don't even make it to me anymore.
[598.00 → 600.00] They get shot down before.
[600.00 → 601.00] Yeah, they actually.
[601.00 → 602.00] Like I'll.
[602.00 → 605.00] Just why waste their time bringing it to you.
[605.00 → 607.00] I'll, I'll overhear something being talked about.
[607.00 → 609.00] I'm like, nah, it's ridiculous.
[609.00 → 610.00] Yeah.
[610.00 → 611.00] Uh, and they'll be like, yeah, yeah, we know.
[611.00 → 612.00] We're just laughing about it.
[612.00 → 615.00] Or like, no, we're not doing that.
[615.00 → 616.00] They're like, yeah, yeah.
[616.00 → 617.00] Yeah, it's fine.
[617.00 → 618.00] Yeah.
[618.00 → 619.00] That's cool.
[619.00 → 620.00] We know.
[620.00 → 621.00] Yeah.
[621.00 → 622.00] So like, and, and.
[622.00 → 623.00] It's always, it's always a fine line.
[623.00 → 624.00] Yeah.
[624.00 → 630.00] And there's like, I, I think one thing that I, I respect a fair amount is I think how you view
[630.00 → 631.00] usually taking a stance at it.
[631.00 → 636.00] I'm just shooting in the dark here right now is if you would hate it as a viewer.
[636.00 → 637.00] Yeah.
[637.00 → 638.00] You don't do it.
[638.00 → 639.00] I've tried not to do it.
[639.00 → 644.00] There are some things honestly that I've done, even though I hate them as a viewer.
[644.00 → 650.00] So something that I haven't done because I hate them as a viewer is, um, mid-roll ads in
[650.00 → 651.00] the videos.
[651.00 → 652.00] Yeah.
[652.00 → 654.00] So we do our sponsor spots at the beginning.
[654.00 → 655.00] So we do our hook.
[655.00 → 660.00] Then we do a 10 to 15 second spot, which the clever among you have probably noticed that
[660.00 → 664.00] you can double-click in the YouTube window, and it will skip that almost perfectly every
[664.00 → 665.00] time.
[665.00 → 666.00] Just saying.
[666.00 → 673.00] Um, then we do the bulk of our video and there will be no YouTube true view ad baked
[673.00 → 674.00] in.
[674.00 → 679.00] We get a lot of people criticizing us for, Oh, you guys made it 10 minutes and three seconds
[679.00 → 680.00] for the money.
[680.00 → 684.00] Except that if we don't put a mid-roll ad in it, it doesn't do it.
[684.00 → 685.00] There isn't more money.
[685.00 → 686.00] Yeah.
[686.00 → 687.00] So.
[687.00 → 691.00] A lot of people don't actually understand that.
[691.00 → 694.00] They just, they just know the like, make it 10 minutes for more money thing.
[694.00 → 699.00] So we're not afraid to make money, and I'm not ashamed to say that this is a business
[699.00 → 700.00] and that I have mouth to feed.
[700.00 → 704.00] I have literally over two dozen mouths to feed now.
[704.00 → 705.00] That's, that's the way it is.
[705.00 → 708.00] But everything that we do is skippable.
[708.00 → 710.00] Are you getting close to three?
[710.00 → 712.00] With the next hiring wave?
[712.00 → 713.00] Yeah.
[713.00 → 714.00] We're going to be close to including float plane.
[714.00 → 715.00] Yeah.
[715.00 → 718.00] Including float plane, including the nanny, including my children.
[718.00 → 721.00] We are well over three dozen by that point.
[721.00 → 722.00] Yeah.
[722.00 → 723.00] Nice.
[723.00 → 728.00] Sorry, buddy.
[728.00 → 729.00] Yeah.
[729.00 → 730.00] No, I've been, it's funny.
[730.00 → 732.00] Like I've been, we've talked about this offline.
[732.00 → 733.00] Yeah.
[733.00 → 735.00] Like I've been doing a lot of soul-searching lately.
[735.00 → 736.00] Yeah.
[736.00 → 737.00] Because I never wanted this.
[737.00 → 738.00] No.
[738.00 → 739.00] This was never my intention.
[739.00 → 740.00] You were there.
[740.00 → 741.00] Yeah.
[741.00 → 742.00] We had conversations early on.
[742.00 → 744.00] Like this was not the goal.
[744.00 → 748.00] I didn't want to, I didn't want to turn into like an enterprise.
[748.00 → 749.00] Corporatize.
[749.00 → 756.00] Um, but like we're, we're getting to the point where it's kind of taking on a life of its own
[756.00 → 757.00] right now.
[757.00 → 769.00] Like there are projects that are underway under this roof that I have almost or literally nothing to do with that could fundamentally change the way that we do business.
[769.00 → 778.00] Because as it turns out, if you hire good people, they're going to have their own ambitions, and they're going to have their own ideas and their own goals.
[778.00 → 786.00] And I'm going to be looking at it going, well, I mean, I don't know if that's exactly what I would have done, but I can't exactly stop you.
[786.00 → 793.00] Because ultimately you have to grow, and you have to learn as both personally and professionally.
[793.00 → 797.00] And if I get in your way, you're going to leave and you're perfect.
[797.00 → 799.00] And I'd really like you to stay on my team.
[799.00 → 803.00] So I guess I need to find the best way that I can support this.
[803.00 → 806.00] And, um, sure.
[806.00 → 809.00] Guess we're hiring another bunch of people.
[809.00 → 813.00] And like, it's a good thing.
[813.00 → 816.00] Obviously this is a very first world problem, and I'm not complaining.
[816.00 → 822.00] Linus Media Group as a business is doing phenomenally well for those of you concerned for our wellbeing, you know?
[822.00 → 829.00] Um, I actually, I actually recently achieved something that's been a goal of mine for quite some time now.
[829.00 → 836.00] Um, and I feel like I'm kind of spilling some of your beans here, and I apologize in advance because I'm not going to stop.
[836.00 → 842.00] We just can't say, we can't add details on the no, no, no, we can't add details on the previous part yet.
[842.00 → 845.00] Uh, the previous part.
[845.00 → 850.00] Uh, what's it off-screen?
[850.00 → 852.00] What should type in?
[852.00 → 853.00] Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[853.00 → 854.00] No, no, no.
[854.00 → 855.00] I know.
[855.00 → 856.00] No, no, no details about any of them.
[856.00 → 857.00] No.
[857.00 → 858.00] Okay.
[858.00 → 870.00] But the goal that I achieved is back when we were working out of the Langley house, um, we at our peak there had a team of eight or nine people or something like that.
[870.00 → 871.00] Anyway.
[871.00 → 876.00] So, everyone who joined pretty close to the beginning within the first couple of years worked out of that house.
[876.00 → 877.00] Mm-hmm.
[877.00 → 892.00] And as of, um, like two weeks ago, I have officially achieved a goal that I set for myself when Linus Media Group purchased that property to run out of.
[892.00 → 895.00] And the goal was actually to be there forever, by the way.
[895.00 → 896.00] Yeah.
[896.00 → 902.00] I thought five years in, we'd have five or six people and that would, that I'd be really happy with that.
[902.00 → 903.00] We'd all make like.
[903.00 → 904.00] So did I.
[904.00 → 906.00] We'd all make a living, we'd all make a living wage doing what we loved.
[906.00 → 908.00] And wouldn't that be cool, right?
[908.00 → 909.00] Yeah.
[909.00 → 910.00] Anyway.
[910.00 → 913.00] We're six years in now, we're coming close to 30.
[913.00 → 914.00] Anywho.
[914.00 → 921.00] Um, so when Linus Media Group bought that property because it needed it, we couldn't keep working out of my garage.
[921.00 → 922.00] Yeah.
[922.00 → 923.00] That was not sustainable for me.
[923.00 → 925.00] It was not sustainable for the staff.
[925.00 → 926.00] It was ridiculous.
[926.00 → 927.00] It was stupid.
[927.00 → 928.00] We should never should have done it.
[928.00 → 930.00] We didn't have the money that we had to.
[930.00 → 931.00] Yeah, I was like, we, yeah.
[931.00 → 932.00] It was not optional.
[932.00 → 933.00] It just sucked.
[933.00 → 934.00] Yeah.
[934.00 → 937.00] Um, so I went, well, Linus Media Group bought a house.
[937.00 → 947.00] So my goal is for everyone who works for Linus Media Group to own a house or if not a detached home to be in the real estate market.
[947.00 → 952.00] And everyone has sort of different preferences and different sort of goals.
[952.00 → 959.00] Like, um, one of the people who worked out of that house, um, has a detached home, like way in the middle of nowhere.
[959.00 → 966.00] And then, uh, at least a couple of them have like really decent sized town homes, but that are much closer to the city.
[966.00 → 970.00] So it's like sort of, it's, everyone's taken a different approach to it.
[970.00 → 973.00] But as of a couple of weeks ago, I achieved that goal.
[973.00 → 981.00] Every single person except Nick Van Burke, who I love dearly, but is no longer my problem, um, is now a homeowner.
[981.00 → 984.00] And so I thought that was really cool.
[984.00 → 987.00] That was, um, that was a huge personal goal for me.
[987.00 → 989.00] And so I'm feeling perfect about myself.
[989.00 → 991.00] So I'm talking about it on my own show.
[991.00 → 992.00] Cool.
[994.00 → 995.00] It's been scary.
[995.00 → 997.00] I'm the last variable.
[997.00 → 998.00] He's the last one.
[998.00 → 1000.00] And you totally could have done it earlier.
[1000.00 → 1001.00] Yeah.
[1002.00 → 1003.00] Ugh.
[1003.00 → 1007.00] I was like, is he ever going to like, is he ever going to do this?
[1007.00 → 1008.00] Like I'm...
[1008.00 → 1009.00] There's a yeah.
[1009.00 → 1010.00] There's a yeah.
[1010.00 → 1011.00] There are a few reasons why I did it.
[1011.00 → 1015.00] I know, I know there are a lot of reasons, but like...
[1015.00 → 1016.00] But yeah, no, I know.
[1016.00 → 1018.00] It was a long time coming for sure.
[1018.00 → 1020.00] I wish you had done it earlier.
[1020.00 → 1025.00] Cause like Langley, Langley real estate has been a thing.
[1025.00 → 1027.00] I bought it at its lowest point.
[1027.00 → 1031.00] And like a week after I bought it, the market in that area went up by 1.6%.
[1031.00 → 1032.00] Really?
[1032.00 → 1033.00] Yeah.
[1033.00 → 1034.00] Boom.
[1034.00 → 1035.00] Nice.
[1035.00 → 1036.00] So you're already profitable.
[1036.00 → 1037.00] Yeah.
[1037.00 → 1038.00] Nice.
[1038.00 → 1039.00] Okay.
[1039.00 → 1043.00] I'm not going to give any details about sort of what the status is, but yeah, the deal closed
[1043.00 → 1044.00] like a couple of weeks back, I think.
[1044.00 → 1045.00] Is that right?
[1045.00 → 1048.00] Uh, I like got the keys.
[1050.00 → 1051.00] He's thinking.
[1051.00 → 1052.00] Wednesday.
[1052.00 → 1053.00] Nice.
[1053.00 → 1054.00] Yeah.
[1054.00 → 1055.00] So I've been there for two days, I guess.
[1055.00 → 1056.00] Oh, you're there?
[1056.00 → 1058.00] No, well, not really.
[1058.00 → 1059.00] Oh, technically.
[1059.00 → 1060.00] Yeah.
[1060.00 → 1061.00] Okay.
[1061.00 → 1063.00] Except I sort of am because it was an estate sale.
[1063.00 → 1064.00] Right.
[1064.00 → 1065.00] So it's 100% liable already.
[1065.00 → 1066.00] So it's empty.
[1066.00 → 1069.00] Well, no, it's not empty.
[1069.00 → 1070.00] There are furnishings there.
[1070.00 → 1071.00] I mean in terms of people.
[1071.00 → 1074.00] Oh, yeah.
[1074.00 → 1075.00] Awkward.
[1075.00 → 1079.00] Basically I got the keys two days after it closed cause there was no one there.
[1079.00 → 1084.00] But that also means there was like a couch and other stuff.
[1084.00 → 1085.00] Cool.
[1085.00 → 1087.00] Beds and chairs and desks and everything.
[1087.00 → 1088.00] That got really awkward.
[1088.00 → 1089.00] Yup.
[1089.00 → 1090.00] Anyway, moving on.
[1090.00 → 1091.00] Tech topics.
[1091.00 → 1092.00] Yeah.
[1092.00 → 1093.00] What was our headline topic?
[1093.00 → 1094.00] Let's do that.
[1094.00 → 1096.00] Let's try and do, let's do that first.
[1096.00 → 1097.00] EA Anthem.
[1097.00 → 1098.00] Yes.
[1098.00 → 1099.00] Anthem bug breaking PS4s.
[1099.00 → 1101.00] This was posted by Over on the forum.
[1101.00 → 1105.00] I've already kind of talked about this on Tech Linked, but we've got a little bit more details.
[1105.00 → 1106.00] The original article.
[1106.00 → 1107.00] Yeah, I know, right?
[1110.00 → 1111.00] You know what?
[1111.00 → 1112.00] Okay.
[1112.00 → 1113.00] No, we're going to talk about this in a bit.
[1113.00 → 1115.00] I'm going to derail us again.
[1115.00 → 1119.00] We've actually got a really cool concept in the works for Tech Linked.
[1119.00 → 1120.00] Okay.
[1120.00 → 1131.00] We're thinking of filling in the Tuesday and Thursday slots with a more detailed, like deeper dive into one topic each day.
[1131.00 → 1132.00] Okay.
[1132.00 → 1134.00] So tell me what you think of, tell me what you think of the idea.
[1134.00 → 1146.00] I kind of pitched a name that I liked the name R8Bits because it's like eight bits, and it's also deeper than two bits, you know?
[1146.00 → 1151.00] So it's deeper than true or false.
[1151.00 → 1152.00] Yeah.
[1152.00 → 1155.00] No, I meant like two bits, like here's my two bits.
[1155.00 → 1156.00] Yeah.
[1156.00 → 1157.00] Like the yeah.
[1157.00 → 1160.00] And it's, you know, eight bites because it's like, haha, it's nerdy.
[1160.00 → 1161.00] Yeah.
[1161.00 → 1162.00] I got it.
[1162.00 → 1164.00] And then, and then, and then what I-
[1164.00 → 1166.00] I think most people are going to think it's a reference to graphics.
[1166.00 → 1168.00] Yeah, exactly.
[1168.00 → 1172.00] And so it's like, it's got, you know how much I love the double entendre, right?
[1172.00 → 1173.00] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1173.00 → 1177.00] So, but then what I thought was we could actually tie that into the format.
[1177.00 → 1185.00] So it's something that Riley and James have been workshopping, and I'm not going to take credit for sort of the idea of us expanding the tech linked lineup or like any of this.
[1185.00 → 1192.00] And like, mostly this is me kind of trying to figure out like branding and presentation of it and like how to, how to streamline it a little bit.
[1192.00 → 1207.00] But I thought, what if we sent a requirement for ourselves where our eight bits has to take eight different pieces, eight different opinions from a minimum of four different sources.
[1207.00 → 1222.00] And then we've got our two hosts and we each are in charge of presenting one side of it with then a discussion and a wrap up at the end as sort of like a way to cover deeper topics that are more opinion driven.
[1222.00 → 1223.00] Okay.
[1223.00 → 1224.00] Fairly.
[1224.00 → 1225.00] Fairly.
[1225.00 → 1228.00] Are you guys going to consider doing topics that you've done earlier that week?
[1228.00 → 1229.00] I think we would.
[1229.00 → 1230.00] Yeah.
[1230.00 → 1231.00] Yeah.
[1231.00 → 1232.00] Yeah.
[1232.00 → 1233.00] Especially because tech linked is so timely.
[1233.00 → 1237.00] Like it's whatever happened that day at like six o'clock.
[1237.00 → 1238.00] Yeah.
[1238.00 → 1239.00] Yeah.
[1239.00 → 1240.00] So you might not have the whole story because the whole story might not exist yet.
[1240.00 → 1241.00] Exactly.
[1241.00 → 1251.00] So if something turns out to be like something has further developments in the, in the days that follow, I think it would be a great opportunity to really revisit in greater depth.
[1251.00 → 1258.00] I don't think it's going to do as many views as a standard tech linked episode because the great thing about tech linked is it's, it's rapid fire.
[1258.00 → 1259.00] It's funny TM.
[1259.00 → 1260.00] I think it's funny.
[1260.00 → 1261.00] Whatever you guys are.
[1261.00 → 1262.00] I think it's funny too.
[1262.00 → 1263.00] You guys are welcome to your own opinions.
[1263.00 → 1264.00] Tech linked is great.
[1264.00 → 1265.00] I actually love tech linked.
[1265.00 → 1266.00] It's yeah.
[1266.00 → 1271.00] It may be my favourite thing that we do right now, other than certain LTT things like the liquid cooled switch.
[1271.00 → 1272.00] Actually, some of the tech cookie stuff we've done recently is pretty good too.
[1272.00 → 1273.00] Everything's doing perfect.
[1273.00 → 1274.00] John's been, John's been doing some really cool topics.
[1274.00 → 1275.00] Like, the liquid cooled switch.
[1275.00 → 1276.00] Actually, some of the tech cookie stuff we've done recently is pretty good too.
[1276.00 → 1277.00] Everything's doing perfect.
[1277.00 → 1280.00] John's been, John's been doing some really cool topics.
[1280.00 → 1284.00] Like, I thought the recent ones on why are headphone jacks going away?
[1284.00 → 1286.00] Why removable batteries are never coming back?
[1286.00 → 1295.00] Just, it's, it's such a sort of on the surface obvious thing, but then there's other, there are other factors at play, and he's done a good job of summarizing it.
[1295.00 → 1297.00] It's like the acceptance level of grievance.
[1297.00 → 1298.00] But in general.
[1298.00 → 1300.00] Watching the tech cookie video on why it's not.
[1300.00 → 1309.00] John is just helping everyone move on from these like hurtful moments.
[1309.00 → 1312.00] Sorry, keep going.
[1312.00 → 1316.00] Maybe it's just cause like tech links is the hot new chick or something, but because it's the newest thing we're doing.
[1316.00 → 1317.00] Yeah.
[1317.00 → 1318.00] But like, I really, really like it.
[1318.00 → 1327.00] Anyway, I don't think because it's so rapid fire, and it covers such a broad variety of things, people can click on it even if they're not necessarily interested in the headline topic.
[1327.00 → 1330.00] And there's probably going to be something in there for them.
[1330.00 → 1331.00] Yeah.
[1331.00 → 1335.00] Whereas this is really going to stick to whatever it is we're talking about.
[1335.00 → 1342.00] So I don't think it's going to do the same kind of view numbers, but I think it's kind of important for us to just try something different.
[1342.00 → 1348.00] Have you guys looked into how often you would have two major things per week that you want to dive into?
[1348.00 → 1361.00] No, but I suspect we wouldn't find any shortage of them because I think the Tuesday, Thursday sessions or the Tuesday, Thursday uploads wouldn't necessarily have to be so timely.
[1361.00 → 1366.00] Like we could go back, and we could look at something that has been developing for a long time, like article 13.
[1366.00 → 1370.00] Or even be over for a few months and doing a retrospective on it.
[1370.00 → 1371.00] Exactly.
[1371.00 → 1373.00] Like, Hey, what the heck happened with that?
[1373.00 → 1375.00] Here's the postmortem.
[1375.00 → 1380.00] Or like what has happened as a result of that in the last six months or whatever.
[1380.00 → 1381.00] Yeah.
[1381.00 → 1387.00] And like the thing is with, with Sancho, with, with the regular tech link format, I feel like it's really hard for us to go back and rehash things.
[1387.00 → 1391.00] It feels unnecessary because we're supposed to be more news oriented.
[1391.00 → 1392.00] Yeah.
[1392.00 → 1396.00] So article 13 is a great example of that, where that is still very much going on behind the scenes.
[1396.00 → 1398.00] It is still very much a problem.
[1399.00 → 1401.00] Um, and it's like hard to keep track.
[1401.00 → 1402.00] That's coming very soon.
[1402.00 → 1403.00] Yeah.
[1403.00 → 1414.00] Um, but like, we can't just be talking about it every week, or we become some of the other tech podcasts that I've watched fail over the years when they're just constantly harping on the same things and people tune out because it's boring.
[1414.00 → 1417.00] But the thing is that news isn't always entertaining.
[1417.00 → 1418.00] I'm sorry.
[1418.00 → 1423.00] And so maybe that's what the eight bits is, is it's the not entertaining.
[1423.00 → 1427.00] And we're still going to try and be entertaining because we're just funny people.
[1427.00 → 1428.00] TM.
[1428.00 → 1435.00] But, but yeah, we'd want it to be a little bit more serious.
[1435.00 → 1436.00] Yeah.
[1436.00 → 1438.00] I, are you married to eight bits?
[1438.00 → 1439.00] No.
[1439.00 → 1441.00] Should we like workshop a name?
[1441.00 → 1443.00] I mean with the WAN show somehow?
[1443.00 → 1445.00] Get them to tweet you or something?
[1445.00 → 1446.00] Um, yeah, we could try.
[1446.00 → 1452.00] Maybe you could set up a tweet of like, try to name the new tech linked segment and get everyone to respond to it.
[1452.00 → 1454.00] Check like float plane chat.
[1454.00 → 1455.00] Yeah.
[1455.00 → 1456.00] I always trust the float plane peeps.
[1456.00 → 1457.00] They're my peeps, yo.
[1457.00 → 1458.00] Yo.
[1458.00 → 1459.00] Um, okay.
[1459.00 → 1460.00] I should really actually do a topic.
[1460.00 → 1461.00] Oh, we haven't rolled the intro yet.
[1461.00 → 1462.00] We haven't rolled the intro?
[1462.00 → 1463.00] That's what float plane chat is telling us.
[1463.00 → 1464.00] Sorry, sorry, float plane chat.
[1464.00 → 1465.00] We got this.
[1465.00 → 1466.00] Got you family.
[1466.00 → 1467.00] Nine bits.
[1467.00 → 1468.00] Wow.
[1468.00 → 1469.00] Nine thousand one bits.
[1469.00 → 1470.00] Don't worry about that.
[1470.00 → 1471.00] Oh.
[1471.00 → 1472.00] Oh.
[1472.00 → 1473.00] Oh.
[1473.00 → 1474.00] Oh.
[1474.00 → 1475.00] Oh.
[1475.00 → 1476.00] Oh.
[1476.00 → 1477.00] Oh.
[1477.00 → 1478.00] Oh.
[1478.00 → 1479.00] Oh.
[1479.00 → 1480.00] Oh.
[1480.00 → 1481.00] Oh.
[1481.00 → 1482.00] Oh.
[1482.00 → 1483.00] Oh.
[1483.00 → 1484.00] Oh.
[1484.00 → 1485.00] Oh.
[1485.00 → 1486.00] Oh.
[1486.00 → 1487.00] Oh.
[1487.00 → 1488.00] Oh.
[1488.00 → 1489.00] Oh.
[1489.00 → 1490.00] Oh.
[1490.00 → 1491.00] No.
[1491.00 → 1491.50] Someone said intro is never going to happen.
[1491.50 → 1493.00] It's time for sponsor spots now.
[1493.00 → 1494.00] Yeah?
[1494.00 → 1495.00] What now?
[1495.00 → 1496.00] Yeah.
[1496.00 → 1497.00] What's up?
[1497.00 → 1498.00] What's up?
[1498.00 → 1499.00] How's some sponsor spots.
[1499.00 → 1500.00] You're right there.
[1500.00 → 1501.00] The ones in the intro.
[1501.00 → 1502.00] Yeah.
[1502.00 → 1503.00] You just got your intro and your sponsors.
[1503.00 → 1504.00] Same time.
[1504.00 → 1505.00] What up now?
[1505.00 → 1506.00] Heck yeah.
[1506.00 → 1507.00] You know what's up.
[1507.00 → 1508.00] That's up.
[1508.00 → 1511.00] Man I'm obnoxious.
[1511.00 → 1514.00] I'm sorry you guys.
[1514.00 → 1514.96] So good.
[1514.96 → 1519.22] I hate Two Factor, but I also love Two Factor
[1519.22 → 1522.68] because I have like definitely been saved by it
[1522.68 → 1524.16] on multiple occasions.
[1524.16 → 1526.90] It's great, but it's really inconvenient.
[1528.38 → 1529.58] All right.
[1529.58 → 1532.90] Do you want to be the first external person
[1532.90 → 1536.72] to see the place as in going there on your way home?
[1536.72 → 1538.64] Or do you want to wait until it's set up?
[1540.02 → 1540.86] You know what?
[1540.86 → 1541.70] Which one do you prefer?
[1541.70 → 1543.06] Are you talking about your new place?
[1543.06 → 1543.90] Yes.
[1543.90 → 1545.54] Huh.
[1545.54 → 1546.96] I don't know why I decided to drop this now.
[1546.96 → 1547.80] You know what?
[1547.80 → 1549.22] I'm totally down to come see it.
[1549.22 → 1554.22] But then also like, am I missing out on the big reveal
[1554.22 → 1555.06] of the housewarming?
[1555.06 → 1555.90] That's what I'm wondering.
[1555.90 → 1557.24] Yeah, because it's like really not set up
[1557.24 → 1558.68] and there's just like stuff everywhere.
[1558.68 → 1561.56] Because I've been taking stuff home like once a day
[1561.56 → 1562.40] kind of situation.
[1562.40 → 1563.74] Are you going to stream from there?
[1563.74 → 1565.24] Yeah.
[1565.24 → 1566.24] When?
[1566.24 → 1568.64] When's your first stream from there?
[1568.64 → 1570.10] Maybe next week.
[1570.10 → 1571.66] Definitely not today.
[1571.66 → 1572.74] Okay.
[1572.74 → 1573.74] You know what?
[1573.74 → 1577.14] I would be down to come be on the first stream there.
[1577.14 → 1577.64] Cool.
[1577.64 → 1579.06] Because then it'll be a little bit set up
[1579.06 → 1582.56] and we should totally play some like ridiculously stupid games.
[1582.56 → 1583.06] Yeah, yeah.
[1583.06 → 1585.06] Are you familiar with the game Libero?
[1585.06 → 1586.06] No.
[1586.06 → 1587.06] Okay.
[1587.06 → 1588.06] Let's play some Libero.
[1588.06 → 1589.06] Heck yeah.
[1589.06 → 1590.06] Okay.
[1590.06 → 1591.06] I'm super down.
[1591.06 → 1594.46] We've been playing Bro force, and I've actually been missing Bro force.
[1594.46 → 1595.88] Bro force is so good.
[1595.88 → 1597.38] We could finish Bro force.
[1597.38 → 1598.38] I'm also down with that.
[1598.38 → 1599.38] We could totally finish Bro force.
[1599.38 → 1600.38] Or we could just do both or something.
[1600.38 → 1602.10] I think we're pretty close on Bro force.
[1602.10 → 1602.78] I think we are too.
[1602.78 → 1603.78] So like we could totally do both.
[1603.78 → 1606.98] I think we're on like the last section other than playing Workshop Maps.
[1606.98 → 1607.98] Yeah.
[1607.98 → 1608.98] Which who knows if they're even there.
[1608.98 → 1609.98] Because like...
[1609.98 → 1611.78] Are there spoilers in a game like that?
[1611.78 → 1612.78] Right.
[1612.78 → 1613.78] Like...
[1613.78 → 1614.78] Like...
[1614.78 → 1615.78] Like...
[1615.78 → 1616.78] Um...
[1616.78 → 1617.78] They have oil.
[1617.78 → 1618.78] Yeah.
[1618.78 → 1619.84] I think differently than us.
[1619.84 → 1620.78] Go, go, go.
[1620.78 → 1621.78] Okay.
[1621.78 → 1623.78] Spoiler alert for Bro force.
[1623.78 → 1627.78] We're past the point where the alien invasion happens.
[1627.78 → 1628.78] Yeah.
[1628.78 → 1629.78] So like...
[1629.78 → 1630.78] I think we're...
[1630.78 → 1632.78] That's clearly the 75, 80% mark.
[1632.78 → 1633.78] Yeah.
[1633.78 → 1636.78] If every game ever is to be...
[1636.78 → 1637.78] Yeah.
[1637.78 → 1639.78] Is it...
[1639.78 → 1642.78] Crisis 1 has aliens, right?
[1642.78 → 1644.78] Or is it Crisis 2 that has aliens?
[1644.78 → 1645.78] I can't remember.
[1645.78 → 1647.78] I know Crisis 2 does.
[1647.78 → 1648.78] I can't remember.
[1648.78 → 1649.78] Does...
[1649.78 → 1652.78] Does Crisis 1 have aliens?
[1652.78 → 1654.78] I think so.
[1654.78 → 1655.78] Later on.
[1655.78 → 1656.78] Did Crisis and Warhead have aliens?
[1656.78 → 1658.78] There's an actual discussion for me.
[1658.78 → 1659.78] Of course.
[1659.78 → 1661.78] Of course there is on Game FAQs.
[1661.78 → 1664.78] I played Warhead on my Dell, blah, blah, blah.
[1664.78 → 1665.78] Don't remember any mention...
[1665.78 → 1666.78] Yeah, they had aliens.
[1666.78 → 1667.78] In Warhead they show...
[1667.78 → 1668.78] They first show up in the third mission.
[1668.78 → 1670.78] In Crisis 1 an alien shows up right at the start.
[1670.78 → 1671.78] You don't find out until later.
[1671.78 → 1673.78] They actually have a whole mission involving exploring the alien ship.
[1673.78 → 1674.78] Yeah.
[1674.78 → 1675.78] Okay.
[1675.78 → 1676.78] It was Crisis 1 I was thinking of.
[1676.78 → 1677.78] And it's always like...
[1677.78 → 1680.78] You're getting pretty close to the end of the game when they're like...
[1680.78 → 1681.78] Yeah.
[1681.78 → 1683.78] How do we raise the stakes?
[1683.78 → 1684.78] Aliens.
[1684.78 → 1685.78] Do it.
[1685.78 → 1686.78] Even Halo's like...
[1686.78 → 1687.78] Uh...
[1687.78 → 1688.78] The Flood.
[1688.78 → 1690.78] There's just like something that gets thrown in.
[1690.78 → 1691.78] Different aliens.
[1691.78 → 1692.78] Yeah.
[1692.78 → 1694.78] These are grosser looking aliens.
[1694.78 → 1695.78] Zach!
[1695.78 → 1696.78] Um...
[1696.78 → 1697.78] Right.
[1697.78 → 1698.78] Okay.
[1698.78 → 1699.78] Are we gonna ever do an actual topic?
[1699.78 → 1700.78] Okay.
[1700.78 → 1701.78] We'll do one topic before the sponsors.
[1701.78 → 1702.78] We have to do the one.
[1702.78 → 1703.78] Yeah.
[1703.78 → 1704.78] We do have to do our sponsors.
[1704.78 → 1705.78] Okay.
[1705.78 → 1706.78] So Anthem, Bug, Bricks, PS4.
[1706.78 → 1707.78] Yeah.
[1707.78 → 1711.78] So some PlayStation 4 players of BioWare's new loot shooter Anthem are finding that they
[1711.78 → 1712.78] actually aren't enjoying it that much.
[1712.78 → 1716.78] And the ones that are enjoying it that much, well, some of them are finding that the game
[1716.78 → 1718.78] occasionally completely powers down their console.
[1718.78 → 1722.78] So when encountering a crash or game error, it'll just get booted to the main menu or
[1722.78 → 1724.78] out of the game completely to the PS4 dashboard.
[1724.78 → 1729.78] But then someone else said twice now, when trying to matchmaker my PlayStation 4 has completely
[1729.78 → 1730.78] turned off.
[1730.78 → 1734.78] After powering down, the PS4 treats it as an improper shutdown as if the power cord has
[1734.78 → 1735.78] been pulled.
[1735.78 → 1736.78] That's bizarre.
[1736.78 → 1739.78] And then on startup, it goes through a short process of checking the internal database
[1739.78 → 1743.78] for any issues before turning back off again and then restarting as normal.
[1743.78 → 1745.78] That doesn't sound like a brick.
[1745.78 → 1749.78] At least two players though have claimed that the game bricked their console, although one
[1749.78 → 1752.78] was able to turn their machine back on again after starting in safe mode.
[1752.78 → 1758.78] So by bricking, maybe what we mean is shutdown unexpectedly, which yes, can corrupt data.
[1758.78 → 1759.78] Cause problems.
[1759.78 → 1761.78] And can brick a device.
[1761.78 → 1762.78] Okay.
[1762.78 → 1763.78] Yeah, yeah.
[1763.78 → 1768.78] However, on Wednesday, BioWare tweeted after thorough review, we have not encountered an instance
[1768.78 → 1771.78] where Anthem has bricked a PlayStation 4 console.
[1771.78 → 1774.78] I would hate to be the PR person who had to write that tweet.
[1774.78 → 1775.78] Yeah.
[1775.78 → 1779.78] In other great news, we haven't actually killed anything.
[1783.78 → 1785.78] We're not going to address any of the other problems.
[1785.78 → 1789.78] So it's unclear if the shutdowns are heat related or caused by something else.
[1789.78 → 1793.78] And BioWare says they will be publishing an update next week to address the major causes
[1793.78 → 1794.78] of these problems.
[1794.78 → 1797.78] Wasn't BioWare like the chosen one at some point?
[1797.78 → 1798.78] Yeah, for a while.
[1798.78 → 1804.78] Mass Effect 1, 2, and 3 were all monumentally, fundamentally amazing games that like changed
[1804.78 → 1805.78] gaming forever.
[1805.78 → 1808.78] And then everything since then has just been garbage.
[1808.78 → 1810.78] You know, I still haven't played a Mass Effect game.
[1810.78 → 1811.78] They're good.
[1811.78 → 1812.78] They're actually really, perfect.
[1812.78 → 1813.78] I should.
[1813.78 → 1816.78] They feel slightly more console as you go through them.
[1816.78 → 1820.78] Mass Effect 1 feels like a definitely feels like a PC game.
[1820.78 → 1823.78] Mouse based inventory system, like that sort of thing.
[1823.78 → 1826.78] And then Mass Effect 2, you start getting combined controls per button.
[1826.78 → 1830.78] So like one button does like multiple things, and it gets kind of weird.
[1830.78 → 1831.78] It's still a great game.
[1831.78 → 1836.78] The first like half hour to an hour of playing it is like, what are these controls?
[1836.78 → 1839.78] And 3 is kind of the same thing, but they are great games.
[1839.78 → 1840.78] Okay.
[1840.78 → 1841.78] Yeah.
[1841.78 → 1842.78] You know what I've been really enjoying lately?
[1842.78 → 1843.78] Our sponsors.
[1843.78 → 1846.78] I will tell you which game I've been enjoying lately after, but we should really do our
[1846.78 → 1847.78] sponsors.
[1847.78 → 1848.78] Yes.
[1848.78 → 1850.78] Our first sponsor is, oh, is LTX not a sponsor?
[1850.78 → 1851.78] Oh no, it's a topic.
[1851.78 → 1853.78] Well, we'll talk about LTX later.
[1853.78 → 1854.78] Yeah, yeah.
[1854.78 → 1855.78] That's cool.
[1855.78 → 1857.78] Our first sponsor is Private Internet Access.
[1857.78 → 1861.78] Private Internet Access supports a variety of VPN protocols and types of encryption and
[1861.78 → 1862.78] authentication.
[1862.78 → 1866.78] They've got apps for Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Linux, and Google Chrome.
[1866.78 → 1869.78] They can, you can connect up to five devices at the same time.
[1869.78 → 1871.78] Their speeds are fantastic.
[1871.78 → 1877.78] As long as you've got the CPU for it, like I've seen, I've seen like 30 megabytes a second,
[1877.78 → 1880.78] just like crush my 9900K.
[1880.78 → 1882.78] It's actually in a VM.
[1882.78 → 1885.78] So it's only, is it two cores or four cores?
[1885.78 → 1886.78] Oh, okay.
[1886.78 → 1887.78] Three cores.
[1887.78 → 1889.78] I don't know, but it's at like 70% usage.
[1889.78 → 1891.78] Like killing it.
[1891.78 → 1894.78] Anyway, it's PIA.
[1894.78 → 1896.78] I can't say enough good things about it.
[1896.78 → 1900.78] Check it out today at leg.GG slash PIA when.
[1900.78 → 1902.78] We've got that linked right there.
[1902.78 → 1904.78] And a VPN is good for all kinds of things.
[1904.78 → 1905.78] It's super affordable.
[1905.78 → 1906.78] Just do it.
[1906.78 → 1909.78] You wonder something, a weird, interesting fact that I just remembered about PIA?
[1909.78 → 1913.78] PIA was the first VPN that we used when we were trying to work on and diagnose things
[1913.78 → 1914.78] with the forum.
[1914.78 → 1915.78] If you remember-
[1915.78 → 1916.78] Like way back in the day.
[1916.78 → 1917.78] Way the heck back in the day.
[1917.78 → 1918.78] Right.
[1918.78 → 1922.78] The first VPN I ever had you pay for, for working on forum stuff was PIA.
[1922.78 → 1925.78] So technically we've gone way the heck back with them.
[1925.78 → 1927.78] I also have a confession to make.
[1927.78 → 1935.78] While we were still working with Tunnel Bear, I had a paid PIA account.
[1935.78 → 1940.78] I have a free one now because we're working with them.
[1940.78 → 1941.78] I did-
[1941.78 → 1942.78] Actually, do I still pay for it?
[1942.78 → 1943.78] I don't think so.
[1943.78 → 1944.78] I did too.
[1944.78 → 1946.78] I did use Tunnel Bear.
[1946.78 → 1947.78] Me too.
[1947.78 → 1950.78] And I actually have a really hilarious Tunnel Bear story.
[1950.78 → 1954.78] Did I ever tell you about how I saved Intel at PAX?
[1954.78 → 1955.78] Yes, you did, actually.
[1955.78 → 1956.78] PAX East, yeah.
[1956.78 → 1957.78] With Tunnel Bear.
[1957.78 → 1964.78] So for some reason, Battle.net blacklisted all of Intel's IPs for some reason to log in
[1964.78 → 1965.78] to Battle.net.
[1965.78 → 1967.78] I love that you call it Battle.net, but carry on.
[1967.78 → 1971.78] Because that's what it used to be called back in like the Warcraft 2 Star craft days.
[1971.78 → 1972.78] It's Battle.net now.
[1972.78 → 1973.78] No one's called Battle.net.
[1973.78 → 1974.78] Aw!
[1974.78 → 1975.78] Okay.
[1975.78 → 1978.78] Anyway, Battle.net, Battle.net.
[1978.78 → 1979.78] They couldn't log in.
[1979.78 → 1984.78] None of the streamers or competitors there could log in to their Battle.net accounts,
[1984.78 → 1986.78] Battle.net accounts, whatever, to play Overwatch.
[1986.78 → 1990.78] So what I did was I teamed up with some Intel employees and I got everyone to run around
[1990.78 → 1992.78] and install Tunnel Bear on all the computers.
[1992.78 → 1997.78] And then they would just turn Tunnel Bear on, log in, turn Tunnel Bear off, play the game.
[1997.78 → 1999.78] It was great.
[1999.78 → 2000.78] And it worked, the whole event.
[2000.78 → 2003.78] They would just turn Tunnel Bear on and off to log in every time.
[2003.78 → 2004.78] It was awesome.
[2004.78 → 2006.78] The thing about Tunnel Bear was ease of use.
[2006.78 → 2007.78] Yeah, exactly.
[2007.78 → 2011.78] I could sell that all day based on the ease of use because like my mom could do it.
[2011.78 → 2016.78] And it was so, and it's not just, remember, ease of use is more than just how much
[2016.78 → 2017.78] buttons you have to press.
[2017.78 → 2020.78] It's like how friendly the buttons look.
[2020.78 → 2022.78] Honestly, it does matter.
[2022.78 → 2026.78] I recommended Tunnel Bear to certain people and I recommended PIA to certain people.
[2026.78 → 2027.78] Yeah.
[2027.78 → 2031.78] And I used Tunnel Bear in situations where I just needed something really quick and just
[2031.78 → 2034.78] for like a couple of minutes, and it wasn't even necessarily my computer or whatever.
[2034.78 → 2037.78] just blip, get it going, free account, blah, blah, blah.
[2037.78 → 2038.78] But PIA is in all my permanent installations.
[2038.78 → 2039.78] Oh, now hold on a second.
[2039.78 → 2041.78] Flow play and chat is mad.
[2041.78 → 2047.78] They're like, they literally changed it back to Battle.net because no one said whatever they
[2047.78 → 2048.78] renamed it to.
[2048.78 → 2051.78] So I don't know what you're talking about.
[2051.78 → 2052.78] What?
[2052.78 → 2053.78] I don't know if that sounds right.
[2053.78 → 2058.78] John says everyone I know calls it Battle.net for sure.
[2058.78 → 2064.78] Battle.net now redirects to just blizzard.com.
[2064.78 → 2065.78] Yeah.
[2065.78 → 2066.78] So I don't know you guys.
[2066.78 → 2071.78] I think you guys are all just a little bit on the OG side here.
[2071.78 → 2073.78] Pretty cool.
[2073.78 → 2074.78] Whoa.
[2074.78 → 2077.78] Blizzard Battle.net desktop app.
[2077.78 → 2078.78] Yes.
[2078.78 → 2082.78] I don't think they ever changed the actual terminology, but what do they call it?
[2082.78 → 2083.78] Like in a keynote.
[2083.78 → 2085.78] I think they call it Battle.net.
[2085.78 → 2087.78] Also, we have another.
[2087.78 → 2088.78] It's your favourite.
[2088.78 → 2089.78] Yeah, I know.
[2089.78 → 2090.78] It's my favourite.
[2090.78 → 2097.78] I plan to eat this entire pack of maple buffalo bacon and I plan to start before I even do the
[2097.78 → 2098.78] talking points.
[2098.78 → 2100.78] Shower's jerky.
[2100.78 → 2104.78] Made with high quality ingredients without nitrates or preservatives with the goal of creating
[2104.78 → 2107.78] a snack that's full of flavour and spice, but that isn't bad for you.
[2107.78 → 2110.78] Also, it's handmade.
[2110.78 → 2116.78] One of their flavours, the Moho premium jerky is the tamest of their lineup for heat, but
[2116.78 → 2117.78] it's really tasty.
[2117.78 → 2118.78] It is.
[2118.78 → 2119.78] It's perfect.
[2119.78 → 2123.78] Hints of lime, cilantro, garlic, and cumin helps bring out the fantastic beef flavour.
[2123.78 → 2128.78] And you guys can use offer code LTT to save 10% on all their products at leg.GG slash savage
[2128.78 → 2129.78] Moho.
[2129.78 → 2131.78] You've been enjoying that hot sauce?
[2131.78 → 2132.78] Yeah.
[2132.78 → 2135.78] Have you tried the spice rub?
[2135.78 → 2136.78] I haven't.
[2136.78 → 2137.78] Yeah.
[2137.78 → 2138.78] I haven't tried the spice rub.
[2138.78 → 2139.78] I'm actually pretty excited.
[2139.78 → 2141.78] I haven't tried it yet either.
[2141.78 → 2142.78] All right.
[2142.78 → 2143.78] Oh, yeah.
[2143.78 → 2144.78] Did I say that?
[2144.78 → 2145.78] Wait.
[2145.78 → 2146.78] I did do the thing.
[2146.78 → 2147.78] Okay.
[2147.78 → 2149.78] So what else do we have for topics today?
[2149.78 → 2153.78] Did you get it's leg.GG slash savage Moho.
[2153.78 → 2155.78] And Moho is M-O-J-O.
[2155.78 → 2156.78] Oh, really?
[2156.78 → 2157.78] Yeah.
[2157.78 → 2158.78] Oh.
[2158.78 → 2159.78] Are we using a different code?
[2159.78 → 2160.78] Apparently.
[2160.78 → 2161.78] Oh, are they like specifically featuring this one?
[2161.78 → 2162.78] I think so.
[2162.78 → 2163.78] Yeah.
[2163.78 → 2164.78] You know what?
[2164.78 → 2165.78] I'll eat some of this one too then.
[2165.78 → 2170.78] Use offer code LTT to save 10% on all their products if you go to leg.GG slash savage
[2170.78 → 2171.78] Moho.
[2171.78 → 2173.78] So put savage Moho in even if you plan on getting saved.
[2173.78 → 2175.78] We've got it linked below if you can't remember that.
[2175.78 → 2176.78] Yeah.
[2176.78 → 2177.78] And Moho is great.
[2177.78 → 2179.78] It is definitely one of my favourite ones.
[2179.78 → 2181.78] My favourite two are Moho and Moho jalapeño.
[2181.78 → 2183.78] So I think I kind of have a trend going on.
[2183.78 → 2187.78] But like if you want to mix and match, you can still do that.
[2187.78 → 2188.78] You save 10% on the whole thing.
[2188.78 → 2189.78] Do you want to talk about this?
[2189.78 → 2190.78] Not really, actually.
[2190.78 → 2193.78] I don't even care about the monetization aspect of it.
[2193.78 → 2196.78] Like we're probably going to lose monetization on the land show if we do.
[2196.78 → 2198.78] But like who cares, I guess.
[2198.78 → 2203.78] I also personally don't find it like, I mean, I'm down.
[2203.78 → 2204.78] I'm down.
[2204.78 → 2205.78] I'm not against it.
[2205.78 → 2207.78] I just don't find it very interesting.
[2207.78 → 2211.78] So the original sources from the Steam community actually, it's an announcement.
[2211.78 → 2218.78] So Steam will not be distributing a game called Rape Day, mounting, following mounting outrage,
[2218.78 → 2220.78] calling on Valve to ban it.
[2220.78 → 2223.78] So this was, it came about because of a change.org petition.
[2223.78 → 2225.78] And, um...
[2225.78 → 2232.78] Apparently it's a visual novel where you control the choices of a sociopath during a zombie apocalypse.
[2232.78 → 2234.78] According to the developer's website, you can virtually harass...
[2234.78 → 2235.78] Verbally harass.
[2235.78 → 2236.78] Verb...
[2236.78 → 2237.78] Yeah.
[2237.78 → 2238.78] Verbally harass.
[2238.78 → 2243.78] Kill people and rape women.
[2243.78 → 2244.78] Only women.
[2244.78 → 2246.78] Now I wonder if you can rape men.
[2246.78 → 2247.78] It says specifically women.
[2247.78 → 2248.78] And it's a quote.
[2248.78 → 2249.78] Okay.
[2249.78 → 2252.78] So I guess, I guess no dudes.
[2252.78 → 2253.78] Um...
[2253.78 → 2257.78] So as you progress through the story, you can do these things.
[2257.78 → 2258.78] Yeah.
[2258.78 → 2260.78] And it's a visual novel, which...
[2260.78 → 2261.78] Okay.
[2261.78 → 2264.78] That's a completely different conversation, but like, is that even a game?
[2264.78 → 2265.78] Who knows?
[2265.78 → 2266.78] But whatever.
[2266.78 → 2269.78] I guess you have choices, but choose your own adventure books.
[2269.78 → 2270.78] Are those a game?
[2270.78 → 2276.78] So after a game called Active Shooter debuted on Steam last year, the company posted an explanation
[2276.78 → 2281.78] of their decision to allow any games to be put on the platform as long as they were legal.
[2281.78 → 2282.78] Yeah.
[2282.78 → 2287.78] They described a new system of tags and filters to either hide or put speed bumps between users
[2287.78 → 2292.78] and content they considered too gory, too violent, too sexual, or generally too mature.
[2292.78 → 2298.78] However, they decided not to distribute Rape Day, saying the move comes after significant
[2298.78 → 2301.78] fact-finding and discussion.
[2301.78 → 2308.78] We think Rape Day poses unknown costs and risks, and therefore won't be on Steam.
[2308.78 → 2312.78] We respect developers' desires to express themselves, and the purpose of Steam is to
[2312.78 → 2316.78] help developers find an audience, but this developer has chosen content matter and a
[2316.78 → 2320.78] way of representing it that makes it very difficult for us to help them do that.
[2320.78 → 2327.78] So, in an email Wednesday night, the developer of the game acknowledged Steam might not be
[2327.78 → 2329.78] the best platform for the game.
[2329.78 → 2334.78] I think I might agree with Steam that my game is not the right fit for a distribution site
[2334.78 → 2337.78] that is marketed at the general masses and children.
[2337.78 → 2340.78] My next move is to sell the game on my own site.
[2340.78 → 2344.78] Maybe that would have been a better move for me from the start.
[2344.78 → 2346.78] So, I guess he gets it.
[2346.78 → 2348.78] Or she.
[2348.78 → 2357.78] I don't know if what I'm about to say is unpopular.
[2357.78 → 2363.78] I don't personally think Rape is any worse than murder.
[2363.78 → 2369.78] In that, okay, I mean we could argue, you know, levels of inexcusable, I suppose.
[2369.78 → 2373.78] But they're both well over the threshold of things that you actually can't do.
[2373.78 → 2378.78] Right, so they're both into extreme forbidden.
[2378.78 → 2379.78] Yes.
[2379.78 → 2387.78] And so, I guess I am sort of wondering what the difference is between a game where you
[2387.78 → 2395.78] can joyfully kill people versus a game where you can joyfully, I mean maybe it's the fact
[2395.78 → 2397.78] that you can kill people so fast.
[2397.78 → 2402.78] Like if there was a torture game, torture simulator, are we having a similar conversation?
[2402.78 → 2404.78] Oh wow, someone's going to make it now.
[2404.78 → 2407.78] There are also lots of games that include torture.
[2407.78 → 2411.78] Whether, I mean it's not necessarily the main focus of the game, but technically in this
[2411.78 → 2416.78] one, it seems like you could go along without ever actually raping anyone.
[2416.78 → 2418.78] You could verbally harass everyone maybe?
[2418.78 → 2419.78] Is that an option?
[2419.78 → 2420.78] I don't know.
[2420.78 → 2423.78] Could you be just a minor jerk in this game?
[2423.78 → 2425.78] I haven't, and I don't intend to play the game.
[2425.78 → 2427.78] I'm not going to find out.
[2427.78 → 2428.78] Because I don't care.
[2428.78 → 2429.78] I don't know.
[2429.78 → 2432.78] I hear what you're saying.
[2432.78 → 2434.78] I'm going to come from the angle of, it's Steam.
[2434.78 → 2435.78] They can do whatever they want.
[2435.78 → 2436.78] It's a private company.
[2436.78 → 2437.78] Private platform, yes.
[2437.78 → 2438.78] Private platform.
[2438.78 → 2442.78] If they decide they don't want to do it, then they're deciding they don't want to do it.
[2442.78 → 2447.78] I think a lot of people seem to forget that in a lot of different situations where they are
[2447.78 → 2454.78] putting, where they are saying like, hey platform, you cannot do this because of.
[2454.78 → 2456.78] Because of my whatever amendment rights or whatever.
[2456.78 → 2457.78] No.
[2457.78 → 2458.78] It's a private company.
[2458.78 → 2465.78] Now, if you want to talk to them, and you're like, you shouldn't do this because me and all my people are going to leave your platform because we want to be able to say or do whatever.
[2465.78 → 2468.78] That's a different stance.
[2468.78 → 2472.78] But saying you can't do this because of whatever rights, that's not how that works.
[2472.78 → 2476.78] Unless what they are doing is illegal.
[2476.78 → 2477.78] Yes.
[2477.78 → 2479.78] But they are allowed to not allow certain things on their platform.
[2479.78 → 2480.78] Absolutely.
[2480.78 → 2482.78] So I'm completely okay with Steam doing this.
[2482.78 → 2493.78] If Steam decided to take FTL, one of my favourite games ever, off the platform, I'd be like, wow, that's really annoying.
[2493.78 → 2495.78] Maybe I'll go get my money somewhere else.
[2495.78 → 2497.78] But I'm not going to be like that's a you can't.
[2497.78 → 2498.78] Go to Humble Bundle or something.
[2498.78 → 2499.78] Exactly.
[2499.78 → 2500.78] Yeah.
[2500.78 → 2501.78] I'll find a different way to do it.
[2501.78 → 2502.78] Or Epic Game Store.
[2502.78 → 2508.78] So I completely defend their ability to not have it on the platform.
[2508.78 → 2513.78] I also would never have this show up because of the tagging system.
[2513.78 → 2518.78] So I don't really care because I would never see it.
[2518.78 → 2524.78] So it doesn't necessarily matter to me because I'm not going to enable the tag that shows that.
[2524.78 → 2525.78] So.
[2525.78 → 2526.78] Yeah.
[2526.78 → 2527.78] Okay.
[2527.78 → 2530.78] I guess that's all I really have to say on the subject.
[2530.78 → 2533.78] I'm not, I can check if the float plane peeps have anything to contribute here.
[2533.78 → 2550.78] I mean, the thing is that I guess the distinction Steam is making here is not between the severity of the crime being committed by the character in the game, but rather the cultural climate and the potential results of them being seen as endorsing.
[2550.78 → 2560.78] For whatever reason, killing for fun and, you know, brutally in video games is just culturally fine.
[2560.78 → 2561.78] Yeah.
[2561.78 → 2562.78] Um.
[2562.78 → 2573.78] Even like really, really, really brutal stuff, um, is, is culturally fine, but that's because we're more okay with, uh, physical violence, I guess.
[2573.78 → 2574.78] I guess so.
[2574.78 → 2575.78] Yeah.
[2575.78 → 2578.78] Or at least depictions of physical violence.
[2578.78 → 2579.78] Um.
[2579.78 → 2580.78] All right.
[2580.78 → 2583.78] Well, um, that's a thing that happened.
[2583.78 → 2584.78] Yeah.
[2584.78 → 2585.78] Yeah.
[2585.78 → 2586.78] In other news.
[2586.78 → 2587.78] Uh, oh shoot.
[2587.78 → 2589.78] No, there was something else I was going to talk about.
[2589.78 → 2590.78] Oh man.
[2590.78 → 2592.78] Now I totally forget.
[2592.78 → 2594.78] This sucks.
[2594.78 → 2596.78] Before the sponsor spots.
[2596.78 → 2597.78] Yeah.
[2597.78 → 2598.78] I don't remember what we were talking about.
[2598.78 → 2599.78] Uh.
[2599.78 → 2600.78] Dang it.
[2600.78 → 2604.78] Uh, oh, oh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.
[2604.78 → 2606.78] It's not the thing, but LTX.
[2606.78 → 2607.78] Guys.
[2607.78 → 2608.78] Yeah.
[2608.78 → 2609.78] Guys.
[2609.78 → 2614.78] If you want tickets for LTX, um, move fast.
[2614.78 → 2617.78] So this is the blog post from today.
[2617.78 → 2622.78] Two weeks ago, we opened sales for an event that is happening in July.
[2622.78 → 2625.78] So it's like, not for a while.
[2625.78 → 2631.78] Um, since then, we completely sold out of the 250 guided office tours.
[2631.78 → 2634.78] We completely sold out of the VIP tickets.
[2634.78 → 2635.78] Actually, that was in about the first minute.
[2635.78 → 2636.78] We're fine, Peter.
[2636.78 → 2637.78] Um.
[2637.78 → 2641.78] We sold all 500 BYOC seats.
[2641.78 → 2642.78] So.
[2642.78 → 2646.78] I still need, considering Peter's reminding me right now in chat.
[2646.78 → 2647.78] Um.
[2647.78 → 2648.78] Peter Flow plane.
[2648.78 → 2651.78] We, the Flow plane people need computer seat area.
[2651.78 → 2652.78] Don't worry.
[2652.78 → 2653.78] We got you.
[2653.78 → 2654.78] Okay, cool.
[2654.78 → 2655.78] Yeah.
[2655.78 → 2656.78] I just keep reminding every once in a while.
[2656.78 → 2658.78] So the 500 BYOC seats are the ones that are for sale.
[2658.78 → 2659.78] Yeah.
[2659.78 → 2661.78] And I'm assuming there's like, other ones.
[2661.78 → 2662.78] I'm just.
[2662.78 → 2665.78] Any influencers that show up are going to have a seat.
[2665.78 → 2666.78] Oh, cool.
[2666.78 → 2667.78] In case they want to play.
[2667.78 → 2668.78] That's actually pretty sweet.
[2668.78 → 2671.78] So if Jay shows up, and he's like, yeah, I'm a guys, I'm not doing meet and greet right now.
[2671.78 → 2674.78] I can actually, I can imagine him saying it exactly like that.
[2674.78 → 2675.78] 100%.
[2675.78 → 2676.78] Guys, I'm not doing meet and greet right now.
[2676.78 → 2677.78] I have to go play some games.
[2677.78 → 2678.78] Heck yeah.
[2678.78 → 2679.78] You don't have a BYOC ticket?
[2679.78 → 2680.78] I'm sorry.
[2680.78 → 2681.78] I, I have to go play video games now.
[2681.78 → 2682.78] We're still relevant.
[2682.78 → 2684.78] I could totally picture him just saying that.
[2684.78 → 2685.78] Yeah.
[2685.78 → 2691.78] Um, and we've sold around 1800 two-day event passes.
[2691.78 → 2695.78] That is over half of the tickets that are available for the convention.
[2695.78 → 2700.78] And we've like barely been selling them, and it's a while until the convention.
[2700.78 → 2702.78] So you should probably pre-buy your ticket.
[2702.78 → 2707.78] Also, we haven't yet confirmed any of the other influencers that are coming.
[2707.78 → 2709.78] That isn't to say that we don't know they're coming.
[2709.78 → 2716.78] I mean, we haven't come out and said, if you want to meet so-and-so, be there.
[2720.78 → 2725.78] And we have reason to believe there will be tech influencers there other than just me.
[2725.78 → 2726.78] Yeah.
[2726.78 → 2731.78] If you don't give two hoots about Linus Sebastian from Linus Tech Tips, I don't know why you're
[2731.78 → 2732.78] watching this right now.
[2732.78 → 2733.78] I do.
[2733.78 → 2735.78] Um, but that's fine.
[2735.78 → 2736.78] That's cool.
[2736.78 → 2737.78] You know, we're good.
[2737.78 → 2743.78] Um, but if you do care about other people, there is a chance we're even bringing in some,
[2743.78 → 2747.78] like sub one million subscriber creators.
[2747.78 → 2750.78] Just like, come on, come on down, come be here.
[2750.78 → 2751.78] It's a big party.
[2751.78 → 2752.78] Let's have fun.
[2752.78 → 2754.78] Um, so yeah.
[2754.78 → 2760.78] Uh, many of you expressed frustration that you weren't able to pick up a BYOC pass in
[2760.78 → 2761.78] time.
[2761.78 → 2765.78] We are actually trying to arrange more seating, but to do so, we have to revamp our layout
[2765.78 → 2767.78] and make sure we still meet our safety requirements.
[2767.78 → 2770.78] So the fire marshal has some say in terms of how we lay out the venue.
[2770.78 → 2771.78] Yeah.
[2771.78 → 2772.78] But we'll let you know through social media.
[2772.78 → 2775.78] So make sure you're following LTX Expo on Twitter.
[2775.78 → 2781.78] Um, and if you're waiting to purchase a ticket, which we would not recommend over half of the
[2781.78 → 2788.78] available tickets are already spoken for, please note that prices will increase by about 20% with each wave of ticket releases.
[2788.78 → 2791.78] So the dates for the next waves are April 20th and July 1st.
[2791.78 → 2792.78] Yeah.
[2792.78 → 2793.78] So don't screw around.
[2793.78 → 2795.78] Just get your tickets ordered.
[2795.78 → 2798.78] So they're at DH.JE slash LTX 19.
[2798.78 → 2800.78] We're going to have that linked below.
[2800.78 → 2802.78] Someone asked, will you come to dream hack?
[2802.78 → 2803.78] Will you come to dream hack?
[2803.78 → 2804.78] Will you, which one?
[2804.78 → 2806.78] What, what are you talking about?
[2806.78 → 2807.78] Exactly.
[2807.78 → 2808.78] Cause dream hacks going to be here.
[2808.78 → 2809.78] Yeah.
[2809.78 → 2810.78] Well, okay.
[2810.78 → 2812.78] Now to be clear, this is not a dream hack.
[2812.78 → 2813.78] It's not a B-O-G.
[2813.78 → 2814.78] Yeah.
[2814.78 → 2815.78] It's not dream hack.
[2815.78 → 2816.78] Yeah.
[2816.78 → 2817.78] It's a BYOC land powered by dream hack.
[2817.78 → 2818.78] We're collaborating with dream hack.
[2818.78 → 2819.78] Yeah.
[2819.78 → 2824.78] Um, now it's possible that if this goes really, really well, dream hack would be like, this
[2824.78 → 2825.78] was great.
[2825.78 → 2828.78] We're going to bring a full fat dream hack event to Vancouver.
[2828.78 → 2832.78] Well, they, they like immediately sold all the BYOC tickets.
[2832.78 → 2835.78] So might be in your best interest.
[2835.78 → 2841.78] And it's also possible because dream hack and Linus media group each have no way of knowing
[2841.78 → 2847.78] how much the, the other affected the sales of these tickets.
[2847.78 → 2851.78] But what we do know is that together we're fire.
[2851.78 → 2852.78] Yeah.
[2852.78 → 2858.78] So there's a chance that we could turn that fire into a fire festival of sorts.
[2858.78 → 2859.78] Oh no.
[2859.78 → 2860.78] Sorry.
[2860.78 → 2864.78] I knew something was coming because I could tell by your facial expression, but I didn't
[2864.78 → 2865.78] figure it out.
[2865.78 → 2870.78] And it's possible that even if they brought a full dream hack event to Vancouver, the
[2870.78 → 2873.78] Vancouver convention centre has lots more space.
[2873.78 → 2876.78] There's a good chance that we could just have a full fat LTX.
[2876.78 → 2877.78] Yeah.
[2877.78 → 2878.78] A full fat dream hack.
[2878.78 → 2879.78] And we could just like to continue to collaborate.
[2879.78 → 2883.78] So yeah, we've been having a lot of fun working with those guys so far, and we're really excited.
[2883.78 → 2884.78] Super cool.
[2884.78 → 2886.78] All right.
[2886.78 → 2889.78] So it's sort of float plane chat.
[2889.78 → 2890.78] Grown.
[2890.78 → 2892.78] What can possibly go wrong?
[2892.78 → 2893.78] It's going to be fire.
[2893.78 → 2894.78] Yo.
[2894.78 → 2895.78] Oh man.
[2895.78 → 2898.78] Um, wow.
[2898.78 → 2899.78] I guess I was like, this was the topic.
[2899.78 → 2900.78] The game you've been enjoying lately.
[2900.78 → 2901.78] Right.
[2901.78 → 2902.78] Full plane chat figured it out.
[2902.78 → 2903.78] Thank you very much.
[2903.78 → 2904.78] Thank you.
[2904.78 → 2905.78] Flow plane chat.
[2905.78 → 2906.78] I've been playing cross code.
[2906.78 → 2907.78] Cross code.
[2907.78 → 2908.78] Right.
[2908.78 → 2913.78] I know how I've been telling you that one of the things that I'd love to do as just like a totally
[2913.78 → 2919.78] stupid, maybe I would never get there, but you know, I have, I have more money than I know what to do with.
[2919.78 → 2925.78] I'm going to, I'm going to put it all in a, in a dumpster, light it on fire and hope that something good comes out of it.
[2925.78 → 2927.78] Well, it would be, it would be dubbing a game.
[2927.78 → 2928.78] Yeah.
[2928.78 → 2930.78] This is basically like what I would have wanted to make.
[2930.78 → 2935.78] Um, it's, it's a really, uh, retro styled 2D RPG.
[2935.78 → 2937.78] They have a steam demo?
[2937.78 → 2938.78] Apparently.
[2938.78 → 2939.78] Maybe I should try it out.
[2939.78 → 2941.78] And apparently they still have a they have a web demo.
[2941.78 → 2945.78] Anyway, it's, it's difficult.
[2945.78 → 2947.78] It's got a really creative story.
[2947.78 → 2956.78] Um, I'm not that far into the actual main storyline just because I've been spending so much time just like grinding for XP and doing side missions and like, and stuff like that.
[2956.78 → 2959.78] When a game's perfect, that can be awesome.
[2959.78 → 2960.78] So like, whatever.
[2960.78 → 2961.78] So like, whatever.
[2961.78 → 2965.78] So I don't know how deep the story goes, but it's a perfect concept so far.
[2965.78 → 2966.78] I'm really enjoying it.
[2966.78 → 2968.78] It's legitimately difficult.
[2968.78 → 2977.78] Although I think part of the problem might be that I'm playing with a controller and I just assumed because it's a top-down RPG that like controller was the way to go.
[2977.78 → 2983.78] But then even with my trackpad for a second, I was like, oh, these keyboard mouse controls actually seem pretty mature.
[2983.78 → 2991.78] And there's like a lot of, um, weird bindings on the controller where like, if you press this one, it does this.
[2991.78 → 2993.78] But if you press this one and this one, it does another thing.
[2993.78 → 2998.78] And if you press this one while pointing in a direction, like at exactly the right moment, it does another thing.
[2998.78 → 3000.78] And I'm like, maybe this was a keyboard mouse game.
[3000.78 → 3001.78] So I'm like, I'm going to try soon.
[3001.78 → 3004.78] But now I know all the controls with the controller, and I'm getting good with it.
[3004.78 → 3005.78] So I'm like, ah, forget it.
[3005.78 → 3010.78] Um, but, uh, yeah, it's like legitimately quite difficult.
[3010.78 → 3012.78] I'm really, really, really enjoying it.
[3012.78 → 3021.78] It doesn't, you can, you can turn it into a modern game because you can change everything from the enemy's attack rate to the amount of damage they do to the amount of damage you do.
[3021.78 → 3022.78] Yeah.
[3022.78 → 3025.78] You told me about that, but you're too, you, you're not going to turn anything down.
[3025.78 → 3026.78] It's never going to happen.
[3026.78 → 3027.78] No, no beating game.
[3027.78 → 3036.78] Like I almost lectured my son because he was playing great lecture.
[3036.78 → 3037.78] I know, right?
[3037.78 → 3038.78] He was playing Super Mario 3d world.
[3038.78 → 3039.78] Is that the one for the Wii U?
[3039.78 → 3040.78] Does that sound right?
[3040.78 → 3041.78] I, yeah, I think so.
[3041.78 → 3042.78] The one with the catsuit?
[3042.78 → 3043.78] Yeah.
[3043.78 → 3044.78] Yeah.
[3044.78 → 3045.78] Yeah.
[3045.78 → 3046.78] Yeah.
[3046.78 → 3049.78] He was playing Super Mario 3d world or has been playing Super Mario 3d world over the last little while.
[3049.78 → 3060.78] And he, I walked in once, and he was in like a white catsuit, just like walking through all the enemies.
[3060.78 → 3065.78] And he was like, yeah, you have to like to die a lot of times.
[3065.78 → 3070.78] And then at the beginning of the level, there's like the white catsuit.
[3070.78 → 3072.78] And this is like the best way to beat all the levels.
[3072.78 → 3077.78] And I was like, I'm going to let you finish.
[3077.78 → 3085.78] I'm going to let you finish, but that is actually not the best way to beat the game because that is not beating the game.
[3085.78 → 3088.78] That is staring at the game.
[3088.78 → 3092.78] I mean, you still have to like not fall off platforms and stuff, but it's not exactly hard in that game.
[3092.78 → 3093.78] It's a really easy game.
[3093.78 → 3094.78] Yeah.
[3094.78 → 3099.78] Um, so I was very disappointed in him, and we're going to need to work together.
[3099.78 → 3101.78] Fortunately, he's already better at smash than me.
[3101.78 → 3102.78] So there's that.
[3102.78 → 3104.78] He's actually pretty decent at smash.
[3104.78 → 3106.78] He hasn't even played that much.
[3106.78 → 3111.78] Like I, I had never played the smash on braille before.
[3111.78 → 3112.78] Yeah.
[3112.78 → 3113.78] All right.
[3113.78 → 3114.78] I'd never played that one.
[3114.78 → 3118.78] Um, and I just with a nun chuck, a nun chuck turned to the side.
[3118.78 → 3120.78] It's a little wonky.
[3120.78 → 3122.78] It's actually oddly, like nun chuck turned, you mean cloud.
[3122.78 → 3124.78] Nun chuck turned, you mean classic controller?
[3124.78 → 3125.78] I thought that was super weird.
[3125.78 → 3126.78] So I switched to just the nun chuck.
[3126.78 → 3127.78] You mean the Wii mode?
[3127.78 → 3128.78] Yeah.
[3128.78 → 3129.78] You can't play with just the nun chuck.
[3129.78 → 3130.78] Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[3130.78 → 3131.78] The nun chuck's the extra part.
[3131.78 → 3132.78] Yeah.
[3132.78 → 3139.78] Um, so I was playing with a Wii mode turned to the side and that was, that was, the whole thing was very weird, but I, it was a bit of a struggle fest to try to beat him.
[3139.78 → 3140.78] And I was like, that's weird.
[3140.78 → 3145.78] Because I'm actually, I'm not great at smash, but I'm like pretty decent.
[3145.78 → 3146.78] Yeah.
[3146.78 → 3147.78] I don't know.
[3147.78 → 3151.78] So maybe he just needs to play against other people because he's definitely a hyper-competitive kid.
[3151.78 → 3152.78] Yeah.
[3152.78 → 3153.78] Like definitely.
[3153.78 → 3158.78] Um, anything new in terms of like float plane?
[3158.78 → 3161.78] Uh, I mean, Peter's in the chat.
[3161.78 → 3170.78] So the transcode upload system, mainly the transcode system that's been under work since basically Peter joined the company.
[3170.78 → 3178.78] Um, other than him fixing the, uh, the live chat that everyone's talking on right now, just in case you like the live chat.
[3178.78 → 3179.78] Good work, Peter.
[3179.78 → 3180.78] Yeah.
[3180.78 → 3186.78] Um, that upload transcodes system is in pre prod right now and is performing quite admirably.
[3186.78 → 3191.78] We need to, we need to be a little bit more aggressive about thrashing it and trying to kill it.
[3191.78 → 3193.78] Um, but so far it's, it's doing quite well.
[3193.78 → 3206.78] And the it's funny cause you, you fix all these problems, and you come up with new systems, and then you're like, Oh yeah, that problem that we've totally known about that didn't really matter is now like super important because all the other ones have been solved.
[3206.78 → 3216.78] But uploads to float plane have been kind of slow for a long time and like from certain areas globally, they're really not great.
[3216.78 → 3217.78] Like maybe don't work.
[3217.78 → 3223.78] Well, that didn't matter as much when to transcode has barely worked, but now the transcodes are doing great.
[3223.78 → 3227.78] We need to try to figure out, uh, the upload thing as well.
[3227.78 → 3234.78] So now that's being worked on and Peter already has some, some great ideas, and we've already been looking into stuff, which is cool.
[3234.78 → 3236.78] Mainly Peter and AJ.
[3236.78 → 3238.78] I said we, but I haven't done a lot of that part.
[3238.78 → 3239.78] So thanks guys.
[3239.78 → 3240.78] People.
[3240.78 → 3241.78] Oh yeah.
[3241.78 → 3244.78] Speaking of, uh, speaking of float plane, actually, I wanted to, uh,
[3244.78 → 3249.78] Also the app is almost ready for, uh, open source.
[3249.78 → 3251.78] It's almost ready.
[3251.78 → 3254.78] Did we even say on when show we were open sourcing the app yet?
[3254.78 → 3255.78] I don't know.
[3255.78 → 3256.78] There you go.
[3256.78 → 3258.78] We're going to be open sourcing the app.
[3258.78 → 3261.78] Uh, it's, it's coming along.
[3261.78 → 3263.78] Uh, Jaden's working on that, and it's, it's getting very close.
[3263.78 → 3268.78] It's getting very close to being ready for open source developers to jump in and have fun with it.
[3268.78 → 3269.78] Sick.
[3269.78 → 3270.78] All right.
[3270.78 → 3272.78] Um, and I'm trying to think of, of what else.
[3272.78 → 3279.78] There's some, the like FAQ support, the search, search, channel wide search is coming in hot.
[3279.78 → 3281.78] That shouldn't be too long from now.
[3281.78 → 3284.78] Um, I'm trying to think of, of what else.
[3284.78 → 3285.78] Yeah.
[3285.78 → 3286.78] Yeah.
[3286.78 → 3288.78] We are actually getting shockingly close to...
[3288.78 → 3291.78] Also, there's a ton of like general front end updates and improvements that are happening.
[3291.78 → 3294.78] We are getting shockingly close to being able to bring other people on, aren't we?
[3294.78 → 3295.78] Yeah.
[3295.78 → 3297.78] Speaking of other people that are already on.
[3297.78 → 3300.78] So tech deals, um, is doing a giveaway right now.
[3300.78 → 3303.78] I just posted it in the float plane and YouTube chats.
[3303.78 → 3306.78] He's giving away four RTX 2060s.
[3306.78 → 3307.78] Ooh.
[3307.78 → 3310.78] Um, so he's got six videos up in early access on float plane.
[3310.78 → 3313.78] Wants people to go subscribe on him, subscribe over there, of course.
[3313.78 → 3318.78] Uh, but yeah, I just posted his tweet giving all the details, uh, in both the float plane and the YouTube chat.
[3318.78 → 3321.78] So I said I would, I said I'd give him a shout out there for that.
[3321.78 → 3323.78] Oh, he's giving them away just to float plane subs.
[3323.78 → 3324.78] Oh, is he really?
[3324.78 → 3328.78] Early giving away four RTX 2060 GPUs, early access for float plane subs.
[3328.78 → 3330.78] I don't know what he means.
[3330.78 → 3331.78] I don't know either.
[3331.78 → 3332.78] So maybe not.
[3332.78 → 3333.78] Whatever.
[3333.78 → 3334.78] Full details in his tweet.
[3334.78 → 3335.78] You guys can figure it out with him.
[3335.78 → 3336.78] Yeah.
[3336.78 → 3337.78] Oh yeah.
[3337.78 → 3338.78] There we go.
[3338.78 → 3339.78] Okay.
[3339.78 → 3340.78] Okay.
[3340.78 → 3343.78] All that's left then is some super chats.
[3343.78 → 3348.78] Would you guys, uh, theoretical enigma says, would you guys ever consider taking LMG public?
[3348.78 → 3350.78] I'd love to invest in the company.
[3350.78 → 3351.78] It has a bright future in my opinion.
[3351.78 → 3353.78] It has a really bright future in my opinion too.
[3353.78 → 3357.78] And that's exactly why I will not be taking any outside investment.
[3357.78 → 3362.76] Um, a big part of why I believe we've, and this is, I'm going to be a little bit of a
[3362.76 → 3363.76] thought of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit.
[3363.76 → 3366.76] I hope not just my ego, you know, getting, carrying me away.
[3366.76 → 3367.76] No, I don't think it is.
[3367.76 → 3373.76] But a big part of why we've been successful is that I have had the luxury of being able
[3373.76 → 3380.76] to stay 100% true to my, and by my, I mean me and Yvonne because she is a critical part
[3380.76 → 3382.76] of everything that happens here.
[3382.76 → 3389.76] Um, staying true to my vision, um, that we were so close to having, not because I wanted
[3389.76 → 3393.76] one, but being forced to have an outside stakeholder.
[3393.76 → 3402.76] And there have been so many times over the last six years that I have been so grateful
[3402.76 → 3404.76] that we don't.
[3404.76 → 3408.76] Because there might have been some kind of crazy decision.
[3408.76 → 3415.76] Like, okay, at the time we made it, the decision to move into this gigantic studio space was nuts.
[3415.76 → 3418.76] It was going to put us in debt for a very long time.
[3418.76 → 3425.76] It was totally unnecessary because we, we were still capable of utilizing the space that we had.
[3425.76 → 3434.76] But if I, if I hadn't made that decision when I did, we wouldn't have gotten to the point where we could be sustainable in this space.
[3434.76 → 3438.76] Because we would never would have been able to hire those people and the company never would have grown.
[3438.76 → 3444.76] And that's something that I don't want to have a stupid, like shareholders meeting and explain my rationale.
[3444.76 → 3451.76] We're doing it this way because it's Linus Media Group and because I believe I know what's best for it.
[3451.76 → 3460.76] And I mean, there are other things too, like, you know, we've, you know, I don't want to, I actually don't want to give too much detail.
[3460.76 → 3465.76] The way we run this thing though is, I like to run it as close to a family business as we can.
[3465.76 → 3467.76] And it's gotten more difficult over the years.
[3467.76 → 3469.76] This is actually something again, I think I was talking about.
[3469.76 → 3471.76] Well, because your family's huge, dude.
[3471.76 → 3476.76] Earlier in the show, about having kind of been doing a lot of soul-searching lately.
[3476.76 → 3482.76] And it's gotten harder because we have so many people here now that it's like, it's harder for me to just get to know.
[3482.76 → 3484.76] I have never met everyone Riley's brother.
[3484.76 → 3485.76] Barrett.
[3485.76 → 3486.76] I have never met him.
[3487.76 → 3491.76] And he's done a fair bit of contract work for us, actually.
[3493.76 → 3495.76] I will see him walk past every once in a while.
[3495.76 → 3501.76] I'm like, oh yeah, it's that dude that I don't know and have never met that works in the same building.
[3501.76 → 3502.76] What?
[3502.76 → 3503.76] I know.
[3503.76 → 3504.76] It's weird, man.
[3504.76 → 3508.76] Like there's, and like, Jaden had never met Riley.
[3508.76 → 3512.76] And then Riley sat next to Jaden, and they met for the first time ever.
[3512.76 → 3514.76] And working in the same building for a while.
[3514.76 → 3515.76] Like months.
[3515.76 → 3516.76] Yeah.
[3516.76 → 3527.76] And so, because, because I'm in control, and by I mean, me and Yvonne, whether it's because we want to expand.
[3527.76 → 3533.76] Or whether it's because maybe at some point we might make the decision that we don't want to get any bigger.
[3533.76 → 3537.76] But whatever it is, we can do that.
[3537.76 → 3543.76] And we can do that as a team with the kind of transparency that I feel like I've given my staff over the years.
[3544.76 → 3549.76] That way we can make these decisions together and there's no pressure to outside investors to give them a return on their investment.
[3549.76 → 3554.76] Because that's not what this business anyway is about for me.
[3554.76 → 3559.76] There's even, there's even smaller stuff. Like buying the two reds.
[3559.76 → 3561.76] Yeah. I don't want to explain that to anyone.
[3561.76 → 3562.76] No.
[3562.76 → 3564.76] And there was no business case for it.
[3564.76 → 3571.76] I mean, honestly, the biggest reason that we did that was because it was like an optics thing.
[3571.76 → 3574.76] We were a tech channel using outdated tech for our production.
[3574.76 → 3584.76] And I was like, well, I guess we need to, I guess we need to like, like if we're going to be on the cutting edge, I was like, okay.
[3584.76 → 3587.76] Well, I guess we'll try and get a bunch of content out of it.
[3587.76 → 3593.76] Like we'll do videos about workstations that can handle 8K, and we'll like, we'll experiment with the footage.
[3593.76 → 3597.76] We'll do videos about sort of the workflow changes that we have to make.
[3597.76 → 3599.76] And we'll like, we'll try and get some content out of it.
[3599.76 → 3608.76] But ultimately it was about making sure that if we're supposed to be cutting edge content creators, that we're using cutting edge tools in order to do it.
[3608.76 → 3616.76] And then the other reason that was sort of a close runner-up, I guess, was that Brandon is probably my most expensive employee.
[3616.76 → 3631.76] Not because he necessarily has the highest salary or takes up the most space in the building, but because in order to keep his creative juices flowing,
[3631.76 → 3641.76] it requires a constant outpouring of resources into new gear so that we can continue to try to push boundaries.
[3641.76 → 3650.76] Not necessarily on every video. We upload plenty of like vlogs that are just shot shoulder held that could have just as easily been shot on a Panasonic GH4.
[3650.76 → 3658.76] But there's one coming, a review of the Corsair, the new Corsair One on Saturday. That's just, it's just gorgeous.
[3658.76 → 3662.76] Um, and so there's stuff that we've done that's different.
[3662.76 → 3670.76] There's weird bits to it too. Like one of it is, I didn't understand a lot of stuff before I became a boss of people.
[3670.76 → 3679.76] One of them was, uh, one of your expenditures as a company is like doing things that your employee wants to do.
[3679.76 → 3687.76] If that makes sense. And like increasing someone's job satisfaction was part of the expenditure of buying something.
[3687.76 → 3690.76] Yeah. You wanted that thing and yeah, it made things better, but you also bought it.
[3690.76 → 3694.76] Because you're like, okay, well, I like this person. I want them to stay around.
[3694.76 → 3704.76] So I'm going to kind of throw them a bone here. And there's also other parts of it where like, I still love that the intro to my Amethyst PC build is freaking beautiful.
[3704.76 → 3705.76] Mm-hmm.
[3705.76 → 3713.76] Cause whenever I want to show someone, I'm like, look at this incredibly well filmed, incredibly beautiful intro. That's all you need to see. There you go.
[3713.76 → 3727.76] And like it, so it, it adds things in other ways as well. And those, those types of concepts are really not necessarily even difficult to explain, but difficult to show the value to an investor who probably doesn't care.
[3727.76 → 3734.76] Exactly. So you just don't. And like part of it is cause like, we're just enthusiasts.
[3734.76 → 3744.76] We don't need 10 gig networking on every port in the office. But earlier on the stream, I was saying that we blew like seven grand on switches so that we can have that.
[3744.76 → 3749.76] So if we were to plug literally anything into any port in our office, it's going to be 10 gig, baby.
[3749.76 → 3751.76] Why?
[3751.76 → 3756.76] Why not?
[3756.76 → 3764.76] I mean, even the new internet. I was like, oh, oh, dedicated wavelength is available now. How much is that?
[3764.76 → 3766.76] I could probably squeeze that.
[3766.76 → 3778.76] Um, we'll figure out what to do with it. Yeah. Let's get, let's get it scheduled. You know, like, I don't know. We, because the thing is like, we're not like, we're not really a traditional kind of company.
[3778.76 → 3785.76] I don't think what we're doing has ever been done before. And I don't mean that there aren't other companies like, I don't know, mythical, what do they call it?
[3785.76 → 3786.76] Mythical Entertainment.
[3786.76 → 3792.76] Yeah. Like mythical entertainment or, um, ah, the ones with the trick shots. Um, Dude Perfect.
[3792.76 → 3793.76] Yeah.
[3793.76 → 3803.76] Like those are probably perfect examples of other teams that are doing something quite similar. But I mean, collectively, the teams that are doing this, this whole group of, has never been done before.
[3803.76 → 3811.76] And so the thing is that I think a lot of traditional business people probably wouldn't understand that we have to do things just because they're fun.
[3812.76 → 3818.76] Because if we don't have fun, you guys aren't going to have fun. And then nobody's having fun. And what's the point?
[3818.76 → 3820.76] It bleeds through the camera way more than you'd realize.
[3823.76 → 3824.76] It's pretty crazy.
[3824.76 → 3830.76] Um, wow, that was a really long answer to that question. I'm very sorry. Andre Luke.
[3830.76 → 3832.76] That was one of those questions.
[3833.76 → 3837.76] Hun yo asks, uh, have you ever eaten routine? Just curious. Yes, I love routine. But only good routine.
[3837.76 → 3838.76] Yes.
[3838.76 → 3840.76] And a shocking amount of routine sucks.
[3840.76 → 3841.76] Yes.
[3841.76 → 3842.76] It's very basic. Okay.
[3842.76 → 3853.76] The cheese is supposed to be melted. So if the gravy isn't hot, it's not good. How, is that complicated, Colton?
[3853.76 → 3855.76] Uh, you're talking about, uh, routine?
[3855.76 → 3856.76] Yeah, routine.
[3856.76 → 3857.76] Routine.
[3857.76 → 3859.76] Yeah, yeah. But then there's also like...
[3859.76 → 3860.76] Like it's ridiculous.
[3860.76 → 3861.76] Routine.
[3861.76 → 3865.76] Routine can be terrible though because you, some people that are slow eaters, you wait too long to eat that stuff, you're done.
[3865.76 → 3869.76] Okay, I'm a slow eater, but you can make the fries properly for that. They just have to be a little bit crispier.
[3869.76 → 3870.76] Yeah.
[3870.76 → 3871.76] Uh, they're going to get soggy. You leave a little bit.
[3871.76 → 3874.76] Oh, they will, for sure. But you should make crispier fries with it.
[3874.76 → 3880.76] Yeah, besides, you can always like fork and knife it. You can fork and knife it when it gets like, you know, a little soggier.
[3880.76 → 3888.76] But the point is, if you start out with cheese that is not sufficiently melted because you got lukewarm friggin' gravy on it.
[3888.76 → 3889.76] Yeah, that's the worst.
[3889.76 → 3890.76] That's stupid.
[3890.76 → 3891.76] Yeah.
[3891.76 → 3895.76] And like, 80% of the routine I've ever had has not been sufficiently melted.
[3895.76 → 3896.76] Yeah.
[3896.76 → 3897.76] You had one job.
[3897.76 → 3898.76] You had one job.
[3898.76 → 3899.76] Let's melt the cheese.
[3899.76 → 3900.76] Yeah.
[3900.76 → 3914.76] Because how do you make cheese and gravy and french fries gross? It's like, that's hard. All you have to, it has to be hot. Food is supposed to be hot. Unless it's ice cream, in which case it's supposed to be cold.
[3914.76 → 3919.76] Look, the thing is, it sounds stupid coming out of my mouth because it's so obvious.
[3919.76 → 3923.76] But people can't do it. So I have to explain it to them.
[3923.76 → 3927.76] Ladies and gentlemen, dealing with the real problems.
[3927.76 → 3932.76] It's not like, I want to explain this to people. I have better things to do.
[3932.76 → 3936.76] Oh my goodness. Like explain other things like tech stuff.
[3936.76 → 3946.76] Gamer off-topic says, how's the hiring process going? Hope it's not super stressful. I actually haven't been involved in most of it.
[3946.76 → 3956.76] Like that's one of the behind the scenes' thing that Yvonne does. She's been training Ed and Nick and Colton. And I think there's, I think even Tyler's been involved in some of the hiring lately.
[3956.76 → 3962.76] So there's been a lot of it. I'm actually, some, some applications and some positions are getting to me now.
[3962.76 → 3967.76] So the warehouse assistant position, I have three resumes on my desk to call.
[3967.76 → 3971.76] And then the writers are going to take me a long time. We're hiring a couple of writers.
[3971.76 → 3988.76] That's a very, yeah. That's a tough one. I make the wrong call with a writer and like the content sucks. It is like that. There's nothing more foundational to our business than like the content idea and the writing.
[3988.76 → 3996.76] And it's going to take a while to get a writer up to speed and all that kind of stuff. So it's going to be hard to tell for quite a while. You can see in his eyes.
[3996.76 → 3999.76] Yeah. Brutal.
[3999.76 → 4000.76] Hey, Colton.
[4000.76 → 4001.76] Oh, he's gone.
[4001.76 → 4003.76] Oh, is he gone? Uh, Jon.
[4003.76 → 4004.76] Yeah?
[4004.76 → 4009.76] Are we allowed to talk about the, um, the, uh, the, the Marinas thing?
[4009.76 → 4012.76] Like how much detail can we give about that?
[4012.76 → 4013.76] I don't think that much, no.
[4013.76 → 4014.76] Not much?
[4014.76 → 4015.76] Not much.
[4015.76 → 4016.76] Okay.
[4016.76 → 4018.76] A lot of stuff's kind of.
[4018.76 → 4021.76] Yeah, we do so much like secret stuff now.
[4021.76 → 4022.76] Yeah.
[4022.76 → 4028.76] Uh, King CCG says, I work in tech for a high value mortgage company. I'm allowed to go to one event a year.
[4028.76 → 4032.76] Do you do business packages for your media conference? No, it's not really a media conference.
[4032.76 → 4035.76] I don't think you're going to justify getting this one comped, man.
[4035.76 → 4036.76] Um.
[4036.76 → 4037.76] What would a business package be?
[4037.76 → 4040.76] I have no idea. I'm sure they have them.
[4040.76 → 4046.76] Cause like there's lots of conferences that not just are more business oriented, but are like super expensive to attend.
[4046.76 → 4051.76] And apparently IBM Think tickets are like hundreds or thousands of dollars or something like that. Yeah.
[4051.76 → 4054.76] And I'm just like, do, do, do, do, do. This is cool.
[4054.76 → 4057.76] Uh, we have a video coming from IBM Think, uh, pretty soon.
[4057.76 → 4058.76] Um.
[4058.76 → 4063.76] Peter's speaking at a conference about some of the work he's done on Flip plane.
[4063.76 → 4064.76] Oh, that's cool.
[4064.76 → 4065.76] Yeah.
[4065.76 → 4073.76] I don't know how big, uh, I didn't look too far into it. He was like, can I do this? I didn't even click on it. I was like, yeah, that's sweet.
[4073.76 → 4075.76] Awesome. I just think that's really cool.
[4076.76 → 4077.76] Dork.
[4077.76 → 4078.76] Dork.
[4078.76 → 4084.76] I think it's cool that someone's going to go talk about the stuff they've worked on at Flip plane at a conference.
[4084.76 → 4088.76] And it's, it's about, I believe it's Docker, 40 peeps or so. That's still cool, Peter.
[4088.76 → 4091.76] It is amazing how high profile Flip plane is.
[4091.76 → 4092.76] Yeah.
[4092.76 → 4094.76] Like people have heard of it.
[4094.76 → 4095.76] Yeah.
[4095.76 → 4106.76] Uh, one of the, um, like, uh, one of the friends of the, the main, uh, the main guy behind Vessel, uh, showed up at a wedding that I was at recently and was like, hey, how's Float plane going?
[4106.76 → 4108.76] I was like, good.
[4108.76 → 4109.76] Good.
[4109.76 → 4113.76] That's funny.
[4113.76 → 4115.76] Thank you for asking.
[4115.76 → 4118.76] Uh, Jason says, just switched over from, uh, to Float plane.
[4118.76 → 4119.76] Nerd café.
[4119.76 → 4121.76] Will Float plane have chat on mobile in the app?
[4121.76 → 4122.76] That's super cool.
[4122.76 → 4124.76] I mean, I guess it depends. It's going to be an open source app, so.
[4124.76 → 4126.76] No, if someone makes it.
[4126.76 → 4133.76] Uh, Cool Shows says, uh, Luke, what are you doing to crash Firefox? Also, try survive.io.
[4133.76 → 4135.76] I don't know what they're talking about.
[4135.76 → 4137.76] What are you doing for crash Firefox? I'm sure that's.
[4137.76 → 4140.76] Duct Tape Wallet says, can we please get more camera reviews by Brandon, the new pocket camera?
[4140.76 → 4141.76] Yes.
[4141.76 → 4145.76] So our first one of the new pocket camera, which isn't that small, by the way, it's hard to pocket.
[4145.76 → 4148.76] Anyway, um, our first one was broken.
[4148.76 → 4153.76] So it's taken us a long time to get a fixed one because they're, they have no supply because they're black magic.
[4153.76 → 4157.76] So, um, yeah, we'll get back to you on that.
[4157.76 → 4158.76] Someone in chat. Sorry.
[4158.76 → 4164.76] Someone in Float plane chat said, does Float plane plan to be a tech-oriented platform or do you guys have planned on having multiple different types of creators?
[4164.76 → 4176.76] Um, we actually have a different type creator that isn't tech person who's extremely interested in joining and will hopefully be on the platform in not way too long that I am like extremely excited about.
[4176.76 → 4181.76] And you probably even remember within like weeks of making the platform. I was like, it would be really cool if we had this guy on.
[4181.76 → 4182.76] Yep.
[4182.76 → 4187.76] Um, but I can't say who, um, but we don't want to count any chickens before they're hatched.
[4187.76 → 4189.76] Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[4189.76 → 4192.76] But we're, we're bullish. Yep.
[4192.76 → 4199.76] It's actually kind of crazy. There's been so many times over the last two and a half years, it's almost been, there's been so many times.
[4199.76 → 4212.76] Uh, has almost died. Yeah. Like, or almost looked like it's not going to work. And then every time it kind of doesn't matter because we go and talk to creators, and they're interested.
[4212.76 → 4217.76] Yeah. They're just like, it's like, what do you like about us? Well, you're not Google and you're not Amazon.
[4218.76 → 4222.76] You're not any of those guys. Oh, okay. That's a pretty low-hanging fruit, I guess. Yeah.
[4222.76 → 4230.76] But like, that's how important trust is in, in business. And that's something that I actually didn't necessarily fully understand about this product.
[4230.76 → 4231.76] Seriously.
[4231.76 → 4239.76] Before we started creating it was that even though that was in a lot of the write-ups was like, Hey, you can trust us.
[4240.76 → 4249.76] Um, I didn't necessarily think that people would trust us, but what's kind of cool is that our reputation among the creator community actually seems to be pretty good.
[4249.76 → 4250.76] Pretty strong.
[4250.76 → 4255.76] Even though we don't really talk to anybody. Like you were saying, uh, you were at, um,
[4255.76 → 4256.76] Twitch Con?
[4256.76 → 4257.76] Twitch Con.
[4257.76 → 4264.76] Twitch Con is a wild experience. Like it would be, it would be, uh, honestly for you, you'd probably get recognized by a lot more of the fans as well.
[4265.76 → 4270.76] But at Twitch Con, there is actually much less of a crossover than you would expect of the fans.
[4270.76 → 4274.76] I think there's a lot of people that are either Twitch people or YouTube people in terms of viewership.
[4274.76 → 4275.76] Yeah.
[4275.76 → 4279.76] So when I walk around Twitch Con, there are some fans that will come up to me, but way, way less than somewhere else.
[4279.76 → 4282.76] Way less than somewhere like PAX or a more tech oriented convention.
[4282.76 → 4291.76] But what will happen is there will be like a group of fans around a creator and the creator will like pause things for a second and push through the group of fans to come say hi to me.
[4291.76 → 4298.76] Because he's seen our content, or she's seen our content because they need to build a computer for streaming or whatever else.
[4298.76 → 4301.76] Apparently I helped and munition build her first computer.
[4301.76 → 4302.76] Sweet.
[4302.76 → 4309.76] And I, so I didn't meet her until obviously years later when we were like on a panel together.
[4309.76 → 4310.76] Yeah.
[4310.76 → 4324.76] And she is like, didn't even tell me. She just like said it. And I was like, ah, I don't think that video ever got released, which is really frustrating. It was only like little snippets that were part of like, like a keynote or something.
[4324.76 → 4333.76] So unfortunately it was actually a really great conversation. Um, it was me, Saavedra and munition. Oh, shoot. What was his name? Now I feel really, terrible.
[4333.76 → 4335.76] That already sounds like a wicked panel.
[4335.76 → 4344.76] Um, anyway, yeah, it was, it was really fun. And, uh, the moderator for it was like perfect. I forget her name too. Unfortunately, I'm so rude sometimes. I'm just so bad with names.
[4344.76 → 4347.76] I'm bad with names too, but that sounds like an awesome panel.
[4347.76 → 4353.76] Anyway. Yeah, it was, it was great. And just like the vast majority of it will never see the light of day, which sucks.
[4353.76 → 4359.76] But, um, I, uh, the one interesting one you, you've known, I was, I was a fan of day nine for Everdeen.
[4359.76 → 4364.76] Uh, I met him at a Twitch con like a year or two ago. Have I even told you this story?
[4364.76 → 4371.76] I don't think so. Um, I w I was, I was hanging out, met him, and he didn't know who I was.
[4371.76 → 4373.76] I was just with a friend of mine who knows him very well.
[4373.76 → 4376.76] Right. Um, and he was like, do you want to go hang out with day nine?
[4376.76 → 4378.76] After I was talking about how much I liked day nine, I was like, what?
[4378.76 → 4380.76] And then he brought me to go hang out with him.
[4380.76 → 4385.76] Um, and we're just like sitting around at some, at some like hotel lobby thing for a while.
[4385.76 → 4389.76] It's, it's after the show day nine was on stage like all day with Conan O'Brien.
[4389.76 → 4393.76] He's like tired and just kind of relaxing and everyone's just kind of hanging out.
[4393.76 → 4399.76] But I start talking to him. Um, and I'm like, I don't want to fangirl for too long, but like, I, I appreciate everything you've done.
[4399.76 → 4402.76] And you like helped me find my voice. I started being a creator and all this kind of stuff.
[4402.76 → 4406.76] And he's like, Oh, that's cool. What's your channel? And I was like, Oh, I've been working on Linus Tech Tips.
[4406.76 → 4408.76] And he's like, you're from Linus Tech Tips?
[4408.76 → 4412.76] I was like, what? Uh, he's like, you guys are huge.
[4412.76 → 4414.76] I was like, uh, uh, uh, uh.
[4414.76 → 4417.76] Cool.
[4417.76 → 4420.76] That's pretty sweet.
[4420.76 → 4424.76] That was when I did more like stuff with the channel, but like, yeah. Yeah.
[4424.76 → 4426.76] Hey, you're still on WAN Show.
[4426.76 → 4427.76] It's true.
[4427.76 → 4428.76] Yeah.
[4428.76 → 4430.76] But yeah, that was like, that was kind of a wild moment.
[4430.76 → 4434.76] Oh, speaking of still on WAN Show, I'm probably going to get in trouble for talking about this.
[4434.76 → 4435.76] Uh oh.
[4435.76 → 4454.76] But we do have a little, a little video series that you might've heard of before that, that we weren't really, um, sure about doing another season of because it seemed like maybe it had kind of run its course.
[4454.76 → 4459.76] Um, it doesn't get, it's not about the views.
[4459.76 → 4460.76] Yeah.
[4460.76 → 4461.76] But the community sentiment wasn't great.
[4461.76 → 4462.76] Really?
[4462.76 → 4463.76] Yeah.
[4463.76 → 4464.76] Uh huh.
[4464.76 → 4465.76] For the earlier part of the season.
[4465.76 → 4466.76] Okay.
[4466.76 → 4467.76] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4467.76 → 4468.76] Picked up near the end.
[4468.76 → 4469.76] Anyway.
[4469.76 → 4472.76] Anyway, a little series that you might've heard of called Scrapyard Wars.
[4472.76 → 4473.76] Uh huh.
[4473.76 → 4480.76] And we are still working on a sponsor for season eight or nine or whatever it's going to be at this point.
[4480.76 → 4490.76] But I think I have, like Luke and I have a doc of like ideas for Scrapyard Wars and I kind of threw it all out.
[4490.76 → 4497.76] Well, part of the problem was we kind of ran out of, well, mostly the ideas on the doc that were local, we've kind of used.
[4497.76 → 4498.76] Yes.
[4498.76 → 4500.76] And travelling for Scrapyard Wars is obscenely expensive.
[4500.76 → 4503.76] Or we've come up with other problems that interfere with them.
[4503.76 → 4504.76] Yes.
[4504.76 → 4507.76] Like the fact that everyone like recognizes us locally, which is a pain in the butt.
[4507.76 → 4508.76] Yeah.
[4508.76 → 4518.76] But I came up with a new concept while I was just sitting thinking about something totally unrelated that I think is going to make for the best season yet.
[4518.76 → 4525.76] So instead of being 1v1 or 2v2, it's actually going to be 3v3.
[4525.76 → 4526.76] Okay.
[4526.76 → 4528.76] So the stakes are already higher.
[4528.76 → 4539.76] Instead of just building a tower, you are now responsible for a tower, monitor, keyboard, mouse, audio solution, desk, and chair.
[4539.76 → 4541.76] An entire gaming setup.
[4541.76 → 4542.76] So there are six players.
[4542.76 → 4544.76] So there are six players.
[4544.76 → 4550.76] And each individual is responsible for an entire setup.
[4550.76 → 4554.76] Then, where the teamwork element comes in.
[4554.76 → 4561.76] At the beginning of the season, we're going to go head-to-head in our LAN centre that we're working on.
[4561.76 → 4563.76] So with everybody on an even playing field.
[4563.76 → 4564.76] Good computers.
[4564.76 → 4572.76] We're going to go head-to-head and figure out what the fairest teams would be.
[4572.76 → 4574.76] Then we're going to split along those lines.
[4574.76 → 4583.76] And instead of having a benchmark off at the end of the season, we are going to game for the trophy.
[4583.76 → 4585.76] Now here's the catch.
[4585.76 → 4587.76] There's always a catch.
[4587.76 → 4596.76] Each player is only going to get, and I haven't 100% decided on it, but I think it's probably going to be in the neighbourhood of about 500 Canadian dollars.
[4596.76 → 4599.76] For everything.
[4599.76 → 4603.76] And like, okay, you had a perfect one with sound.
[4603.76 → 4605.76] You want sound?
[4605.76 → 4607.76] You got to buy it.
[4607.76 → 4609.76] You want a good keyboard or mouse?
[4609.76 → 4610.76] You got to buy it.
[4610.76 → 4612.76] That could be almost that whole budget for some people.
[4612.76 → 4613.76] Legitimately.
[4613.76 → 4614.76] Right?
[4614.76 → 4618.76] So you will have, your team will have to make decisions.
[4618.76 → 4621.76] Like, are we going to have headphones?
[4621.76 → 4627.76] Or does like, does one person have to listen for everyone and shout out instructions for everyone else?
[4627.76 → 4630.76] Do we go for better mice?
[4630.76 → 4633.76] Or do we go for sound?
[4633.76 → 4640.76] Do we spend more on the hardware so we have a good frame rate, but are we literally running on ball mice?
[4644.76 → 4648.76] Do we pool resources and try to have one player carry?
[4648.76 → 4649.76] One really wicked setup.
[4649.76 → 4651.76] And everyone else's meat shield.
[4655.76 → 4656.76] I think it's going to be hilarious.
[4656.76 → 4658.76] So I'm really excited.
[4658.76 → 4672.76] So it's going to come down to which team can perform best on the battlefield so we don't run into another situation where a .1 FPS difference ultimately results in the trophy being handed out to the wrong person.
[4672.76 → 4673.76] Wow.
[4673.76 → 4674.76] Wow.
[4674.76 → 4675.76] Shots freaking fired.
[4675.76 → 4676.76] Oh man.
[4676.76 → 4677.76] So I'm really excited.
[4677.76 → 4696.76] The one rule in terms of teams, and I don't know who's going to be involved yet as talents, but the one rule in terms of teams is that Luke and I will definitely not be on the same team because each team is going to need an experienced Scrapyard Warner.
[4696.76 → 4703.76] It's probably going to cost us an absolute fortune to do because not only is the shooting going to be more complicated.
[4703.76 → 4709.76] Like previously we've had the rule that the team has to stay together so that their shooter can capture everything.
[4709.76 → 4710.76] Yeah.
[4710.76 → 4711.76] We're not going to be able to do that.
[4711.76 → 4712.76] You have to build three setups.
[4712.76 → 4713.76] You have to build three setups.
[4713.76 → 4717.76] So we're going to need somewhere between four and six shooters.
[4717.76 → 4719.76] So that's going to be expensive.
[4719.76 → 4721.76] I have some ideas for that.
[4721.76 → 4722.76] Okay.
[4722.76 → 4723.76] I will.
[4723.76 → 4724.76] That might actually save you a ton of money.
[4724.76 → 4725.76] We will brainstorm those.
[4725.76 → 4726.76] Okay.
[4726.76 → 4731.76] Also, the edit is going to be much more complicated because you're going to have all these storylines.
[4731.76 → 4732.76] Oh yeah.
[4732.76 → 4733.76] And all these video sources.
[4733.76 → 4737.76] Like this is going to cost a fortune for us to do.
[4737.76 → 4745.76] But I got, and so I had kind of given up because in order for us to keep raising the stakes, I mean that's why TV shows get cancelled.
[4745.76 → 4750.76] Because all of a sudden you've got all these additional actors for all the new characters you've introduced over the years.
[4750.76 → 4754.76] You've got all these new sets and locations that it just becomes unsustainable.
[4754.76 → 4756.76] And everyone wants to raise every season.
[4756.76 → 4757.76] Like it's like, okay, well.
[4757.76 → 4759.76] And you have to, everything has to get crazier every time.
[4759.76 → 4760.76] That's right.
[4760.76 → 4762.76] The big bad has to be bigger and badder every time.
[4762.76 → 4763.76] You jump the shark, you know?
[4763.76 → 4764.76] Yeah.
[4764.76 → 4765.76] And then you're like, okay, forget it.
[4765.76 → 4766.76] We're done.
[4766.76 → 4768.76] We don't want to jump the shark.
[4768.76 → 4771.76] But this was an idea that I went, no.
[4771.76 → 4778.76] This is good enough that it's different, and it's going to be fun, and it's going to be exciting.
[4778.76 → 4780.76] And the showdown at the end.
[4780.76 → 4787.76] Like I want it to be the best two out of three and the best two out of three of those.
[4787.76 → 4792.76] So three games with each game being the best two out of three training.
[4792.76 → 4798.76] It could be like, we couldn't live stream it unfortunately because then we'd give it away two months before the season actually starts airing.
[4798.76 → 4799.76] But anyway, okay, whatever.
[4799.76 → 4800.76] We'll, we will.
[4800.76 → 4802.76] You could live stream like everything except for the finals.
[4802.76 → 4805.76] And we could capture the entire thing, actually.
[4805.76 → 4807.76] And we could just have that as like a float plane exclusive.
[4807.76 → 4808.76] Yeah.
[4808.76 → 4810.76] If you guys want to watch the entire tournament.
[4810.76 → 4811.76] Yeah.
[4811.76 → 4812.76] Because otherwise it's only going to be able to be highlights.
[4812.76 → 4813.76] Yeah.
[4813.76 → 4818.76] But, but anyway, that, that final showdown, because there could be like back and forth.
[4818.76 → 4824.76] Like maybe in FPS, the people who spent more on their mouse and their tower have an advantage.
[4824.76 → 4833.76] But maybe in a MOB game where it's not quite as, as sensitive, maybe there's an advantage to the people with, you know, a bigger monitor.
[4833.76 → 4834.76] I don't know.
[4834.76 → 4836.76] There's, there's also going to have to be a little bit of like.
[4836.76 → 4838.76] Maybe FPS isn't quite so important, you know, like.
[4838.76 → 4839.76] Yeah.
[4839.76 → 4840.76] Hard to say.
[4840.76 → 4842.76] There's going to be a little bit of like trust and sportsmanship as well.
[4842.76 → 4843.76] But I think.
[4843.76 → 4844.76] Of course.
[4844.76 → 4845.76] I think everyone will be cool.
[4845.76 → 4849.76] We're going to have to balance the teams a little bit based on like how good people are at different games.
[4849.76 → 4850.76] Yes.
[4850.76 → 4853.76] And like, I don't think anyone here is going to throw.
[4853.76 → 4854.76] No.
[4854.76 → 4860.76] Like, but, but like, and I'm saying that now because I know there's going to be comments about that if it ever comes up.
[4860.76 → 4865.76] But I genuinely don't think anyone that would partake in this competition would throw or do anything ridiculous like that.
[4865.76 → 4866.76] No sandbagging.
[4866.76 → 4867.76] Yeah.
[4867.76 → 4869.76] We have been live for almost an hour and a half.
[4869.76 → 4871.76] We should probably go home.
[4871.76 → 4872.76] Okay.
[4872.76 → 4873.76] It's like 640 almost.
[4873.76 → 4874.76] Okay.
[4874.76 → 4877.76] So sorry bye guys.
[4877.76 → 4879.76] Sorry bye guys.
[4879.76 → 4880.76] Next week.
[4880.76 → 4881.76] Same bad time.
[4881.76 → 4882.76] Same bad channel.
[4882.76 → 4883.76] See ya.
[4883.76 → 4891.76] Is there an ETHN1 LTV shipping to Europe with your chief?
[4891.76 → 4892.76] Oh.
[4892.76 → 4896.76] Bye Peter.
[4896.76 → 4897.76] Bye Peter.
[4897.76 → 4898.76] Bye Peter.
[4898.76 → 4899.76] Bye Peter.
[4899.76 → 4900.76] Bye Peter.
[4900.76 → 4901.76] Bye Peter.
[4901.76 → 4902.76] Bye Peter.
[4902.76 → 4903.76] Bye Peter.
[4903.76 → 4904.76] Bye Peter.
[4904.76 → 4905.76] Bye Peter.
[4905.76 → 4906.76] Bye Peter.
[4906.76 → 4907.76] Bunche.
[4907.76 → 4908.76] Bye Peter.
[4908.76 → 4909.76] Bunche.
[4909.76 → 4910.76] Sponsor.
[4910.76 → 4911.76] Bunche gone.
[4911.76 → 4912.76] Stream over.
[4912.76 → 4913.76] Peter's telling everyone to spam and flow plane chat.
[4913.76 → 4914.76] Go, go, go.
[4914.76 → 4915.76] Why?
[4915.76 → 4916.76] He wants to see if it's going to crash.
[4916.76 → 4917.76] Okay.
[4917.76 → 4919.76] .
