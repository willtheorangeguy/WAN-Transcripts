• They mention that current folding phones are either too thick when folded or too large when unfolded.
• They reference the Galaxy Fold as being too big and compare it to holding a Sega Game Gear.
• They think Huawei had a better design for their folding phone, which was thinner and more compact when folded.
• They also discuss their dislike of gradual curves on folding phones, preferring a clean fold with adjacent sides.
• Concerns about screens on the outside of foldable devices

• Machine learning advancements through gaming
• Alfaro beating Go world champions
• Progress in Star craft and first-person shooter games
• Potential AI applications in 3D environments
• The discussion centres around a DeepMind AI system that can play 3D games, specifically Quake.
• The AI was trained to learn the rules of the game by playing against itself 200,000 times.
• The AI's ability to learn from self-play is compared to traditional training methods where human players teach the AI.
• The AI was able to beat humans in a 2v2 match format, with an average score of 16 fewer flags per game for the human team.
• The AI's training method is based on an evolutionary or genetic approach, where multiple iterations of the machine are created and those that perform better are kept, while others are discarded.
• The discussion also touches on the concept of "eviscerating" in a horror movie context, but eventually returns to the topic of AI game-playing abilities.
• Concerns about AI and professional games: potential for convergence on a single optimal strategy, limiting game interest
• Meta strategies in games with limited possibilities (e.g., Star craft)
• Impact of AI on game design: need to balance gameplay and prevent meta strategies from dominating
• Size of the book in games like chess vs. checkers
• Potential future where humans don't find watching human vs. human play interesting due to AI advancements
• AI's potential advantages over humans (e.g., reaction time, accuracy) that can be tweaked or adjusted
• Concerns about AI having unfair advantages or being too powerful in comparison to humans
