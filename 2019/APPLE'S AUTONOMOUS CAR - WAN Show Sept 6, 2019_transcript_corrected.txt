[0.00 → 7.92] we're live welcome to the wan show ladies and gentlemen the show that didn't start on time
[7.92 → 15.48] because I was busy starting my other thing late but I'm also quite impressed at how not late it
[15.48 → 22.40] is I was expecting starting at like 5 45. I went upstairs and started to work I'm not really I was
[22.40 → 30.60] like all right let's settle in for the winter oh man what video sounded good stream sounded good
[30.60 → 35.54] yeah no I think I thought it was a good stream so we were um so Asus made an overclocked well
[35.54 → 40.94] not overclocked, but it has like a binned version of the snapdragon 855 phone and
[40.94 → 51.34] postpone uh check this thing out okay this is like a phone big a thick boy phone for thick boys
[51.34 → 57.62] yeah that's like that takes a bit to reach to the top 6 000 William hour battery wow check out the
[57.62 → 62.32] smoothness of the screen though it's heavy oh it's nice I noticed that right away what refresh rate
[62.32 → 72.36] do you think it's running oh boy he doesn't follow this stuff so no like i can actually like
[72.36 → 80.78] quiz him on 120 yeah oh 120 OLED I genuinely didn't know at all just because yeah I don't follow it
[80.78 → 85.96] it's pretty like oh man look at that the low persistence to that is really nice like
[85.96 → 92.22] so cool I just have a hard time getting excited about phones speaking of things to be excited about
[92.22 → 98.92] I'm kind of back into VR yeah okay sorry hold on give me we'll talk about that later first I should
[98.92 → 102.62] probably go through what our topics are for today so I'm going to talk about being back into VR
[102.62 → 107.46] apple's autonomous car was spotted a lot of uh speculation as to what exactly is going on with
[107.46 → 111.84] the sensor arrays and all that kind of cool stuff on it there are a couple of folding phones launching
[111.84 → 118.96] in September apple and Google are gonna potentially hand over gun scope app user data including like
[118.96 → 125.84] IP address and full names and lots of other stuff, and you can pay with your whole hand at whole foods
[125.84 → 131.18] see what I did there your whole get it because it takes it's not just a fingerprint it's like
[131.18 → 138.18] the whole thing
[138.18 → 153.18] agent 3105 says I just realized I haven't seen Luke on the main YouTube channel in a while
[153.18 → 163.56] all right agent um I think you better find a new career is that like a slow poke meme is that slow
[163.56 → 171.70] poke meme worthy because an agent uh it's been like three years I think agent is probably the wrong path
[171.70 → 180.56] no investigation in your future with that said actually uh oh man see I've got so much stuff to
[180.56 → 185.50] talk about this week that isn't like the no we're doing a thing yeah well okay we'll talk about it
[185.50 → 189.84] later let's get through this apple thing because that's in the title topic yes title topic we'll give
[189.84 → 193.76] the people what they want I'm not eating today actually wait is savage jerky sponsor today
[193.76 → 199.22] uh people not like that or something they get mad when I eat on stream because some people
[199.22 → 204.70] apparently it's like something phobia like they like it actually causes them physical
[204.70 → 209.24] pain to hear other people eating I'm just glad they never have okay well because this mic picks up
[209.24 → 212.56] everything I'm just glad they never had to sit at a breakfast table with my dad
[212.56 → 220.26] oh because I should clarify my stepdad so that you know okay yeah, yeah so the way that that man eats
[220.26 → 227.46] cereal it's disgusting like it's on its unwatchable it's listened to a bull he's like he's one
[227.46 → 233.22] he can't, he actually can't close his mouth to chew because he needs it open to shovel
[233.22 → 241.90] oh god you probably just you probably just did it right it's basically a food mashing machine
[241.90 → 247.28] that just kind of as far I don't even know if he swallows like i think he just drizzles the
[247.28 → 253.02] the cereal scum back, back down his throat and then processes it in his innards
[253.02 → 257.98] auto matcher yeah nick walks up scratches his head and just leaves
[257.98 → 265.12] it's an it's a bad time um anyway so I'm trying I'm going to try not to eat honestly guys I was just
[265.12 → 269.84] starving last week I'm so sorry I didn't have time to eat I actually didn't have time to eat today
[269.84 → 276.28] because Fridays have been stupid over the last little bit um but uh yeah I will try and do better
[276.28 → 284.96] so apple's autonomous car spotted the original article here is from 925 mac.com and this is a
[284.96 → 294.40] pretty interesting car because there is a possibility based on you know the pixels or whatever um that we
[294.40 → 301.34] are looking at an all camera setup with no lidar whatsoever so for those not familiar with the term
[301.34 → 309.74] lidar is a technology that uses lasers to create what is essentially like an uh a point map of the
[309.74 → 316.94] entire environment around the vehicle um that tells it really everything about the 3d space around it and
[316.94 → 325.12] can even allow in Google's technology um the reading of things like um cyclists hand signals um I forget
[325.12 → 330.42] whether it was googled or someone else's lidar tech, but they were able to tell the actual orientation
[330.42 → 336.28] of people standing on the side of the street so not like which way they swing but more which way
[336.28 → 340.98] their body is likely to drift because you can tell which way they're facing that's probably a lot easier
[340.98 → 346.60] to do yeah yeah with that said I think with some people it's fairly obvious that's fair because they
[346.60 → 351.22] like want you to know right you know, but the accuracy percentage still wouldn't be that high yeah
[351.22 → 356.78] and well I mean there was that friend that I had in high school that was uh basically I didn't realize
[356.78 → 361.20] I had been invited out to a date uh I thought we were just like hanging out and going to a movie
[361.20 → 368.20] and then his mom was there and I was like oh okay that makes more sense now and um afterward
[368.20 → 373.58] I like how the realization is just oh okay yeah well it was fine like we were still friends
[373.58 → 379.72] after and stuff like it doesn't matter it's just like afterward um we had this conversation like
[379.72 → 386.66] this is like months later um that went something along the lines of like sorry yeah but I'm
[386.66 → 392.14] I'm like not um, and he's like well when you're ready to admit it to yourself let me know
[392.14 → 393.24] oh
[393.24 → 394.72] oh
[394.72 → 396.60] oh
[396.60 → 397.64] oh okay
[397.64 → 404.40] that's that's like what does that even mean I don't know that's a little aggro
[404.40 → 405.74] that's like
[405.74 → 413.66] like he's attacking you in but like not even he's attacking you in a like you don't know yourself
[413.66 → 417.76] I think it's not that you don't know yourself I think it's like you know at that because remember
[417.76 → 422.06] we're like I don't know 17 is 16 or whatever at this point probably not even any probably not 17
[422.06 → 427.26] because like neither of us would have had our m licenses yeah yeah it wouldn't have been that old
[427.26 → 431.50] probably that's pretty cute this must be like middle school just don't we needed to be driven
[431.50 → 435.28] okay you need to be driven but then I realized that she was there not just as a driver but more
[435.28 → 440.22] a chaperone that was right that was the difference okay um so, so anyway you know like at that age a
[440.22 → 445.50] lot of people you know aren't ready to admit to themselves like they yeah they're they're sort
[445.50 → 449.18] of they're locked into sort of well this is how it's supposed to be and therefore I must probably
[449.18 → 454.14] fit this mould like that I don't know maybe in 2019 this is all sounding very quaint
[454.14 → 459.66] but back in 2002 that was a thing you know that was a thing here and I'm sure in a lot of places
[459.66 → 465.54] it's still very much like that but I don't know that it's necessarily um quite as big of an issue
[465.54 → 472.32] here anyway these days I don't think so um so yeah anyway I don't remember how I got on this
[472.32 → 479.68] I have no right the lidar lidar lidar uh lidar right detecting orientation okay so lets why don't
[479.68 → 485.76] we consult the notes so that we maybe stay out somewhat on topic here, so apple has actually had
[485.76 → 491.54] self-driving car prototypes on the road before now we're not talking apple cars like apple didn't
[491.54 → 497.74] actually build the drivetrain but project titan modified cars exactly where they are where they're
[497.74 → 503.74] clearly very interested in the technology I mean this isn't their first foray into transportation
[503.74 → 509.32] um you know Apple Maps as bad as it was when it first launched has come a long way they're clearly
[509.32 → 515.26] committed to helping people get around being one of the most important things that our mobile devices can
[515.26 → 520.26] do and as far as I can tell apple transitioned from being a computer company Apple computer ink to
[520.26 → 526.52] being an Apple iPhone accessory company so if the latest iPhone accessory happens to be a car that
[526.52 → 531.96] you plug it into I think that apple can get on board with that the iPhone is the beating
[531.96 → 539.52] heart of that company right now so um anyway the new setup has no obvious lidar devices could be an
[539.52 → 546.52] all camera setup uh they recently poached tesla engineering VP Steve McManus and increased the size of the test team so um
[546.52 → 552.52] it seems they are still actively pursuing the project in one form or another, although they did fire 200 employees
[552.52 → 559.52] assigned to project titan back in January so who really even knows who really knows what's going on over at apple until
[559.52 → 565.52] until they tell us because they have some pretty good non-disclosure agreements as far as I can tell
[565.52 → 569.52] with that said I have never had the privilege of reading one because apple still doesn't reply to my
[569.52 → 575.52] messages actually oh this is great let me see if i I don't know if I have uh I don't know if I have
[575.52 → 579.52] I don't know if I have the software that I would need to pull this up nope I don't have that installed on this
[579.52 → 585.52] computer you know what I'm going to pull an um a faux pas ever since we leaked a bunch of financial data
[585.52 → 591.52] I was just going to say it might not be the best software to use at all worry about it while screen sharing
[591.52 → 596.52] yeah yeah no, no I got back to your personal laptop no you're going to use it anyway no I got this um
[596.52 → 604.52] everything's fine so I actually want to share with you um my chat log with Apple support when I reached out
[604.52 → 612.52] complaining that they actually don't have a press contact email on their website any more uh there's just
[612.52 → 617.52] you can view the newsroom which is just articles that apple publishes about itself
[617.52 → 623.52] um, but that's it there's no actual hey I'm a member of the media and I would like to speak to a
[623.52 → 630.52] human being at Apple iPhone accessory inc um and uh maybe it's because you call them Apple iPhone
[630.52 → 637.52] accessory well I had never done that before today so that's obviously um nonsense maybe it's because you
[637.52 → 641.52] spent seven years talking trash about them, I have not spent seven years talking trash about them, I gave the
[641.52 → 649.52] iPhone 6s my phone of the year award it was a great phone, and then they ruined it um
[650.52 → 658.52] case in point well no I'm just being honest I'm allowed to have an opinion so anyway um so I reached
[658.52 → 663.52] out to their live chat because shrink that please I don't even know what's on there just there we go
[663.52 → 668.52] yeah so we good yeah okay oh I need a dongle because you know I'm switching I'm not going to keep using the
[668.52 → 673.52] blade stealth 20 whatever year this came out I don't care it doesn't matter um too many dongles
[673.52 → 677.52] required so it doesn't have a native HDMI which I didn't consider while I was doing that video and
[677.52 → 684.52] more importantly I didn't notice the short shift it has an arrow key where the shift is which is
[684.52 → 690.52] basically the worst sin because I am constantly hitting both of them at the same time while I am
[690.52 → 696.52] typing which causes me to go up with shift which highlights everything which I then overwrite
[696.52 → 704.52] ah also my trackpad seems to be defective that well that's not surprising so I'm I'm done I'm done with
[704.52 → 711.52] this um I think uh dell actually sponsored a video, but they have a fascinating looking laptop in
[711.52 → 716.52] the mail to me right now what was the failure rate of our internal blades I don't know 40 percent
[716.52 → 723.52] something like that yeah not the point not solid oh um one moment please sweet then it doesn't work
[723.52 → 729.52] that well give it give it a sec okay give it a sec I mean we're we're in a remote we're in a
[729.52 → 737.52] remote desktop connection halation mode right now here um yeah why is that not working that shouldn't
[737.52 → 745.52] matter yeah that shouldn't matter at all okay hold on let's just try that again did it we can't
[745.52 → 751.52] hear it so lands just emulated the sounds it didn't actually detect anything I think okay would have
[751.52 → 758.52] been great though yeah well you know i do aim to please there's so star craft 2 has these packs that
[758.52 → 766.52] you can get that are like different people's voices and stuff so like you can have like a commentator
[766.52 → 772.52] cast your game for you or like someone else I would actually run with like a Linus pack in windows
[772.52 → 776.52] so like whenever you unplug and plug things you just go yeah
[776.52 → 782.52] every time an error message comes up it's
[782.52 → 784.52] you can't do that stupid
[784.52 → 790.52] um well I'm going to restart your computer for totally no reason huh
[790.52 → 796.52] this is okay I would be much nicer about it
[796.52 → 802.52] okay it's working now I couldn't careful to you why yeah yeah I got this I got this a blue screen is
[802.52 → 808.52] just accompanied by a laugh track okay so anyway I wanted to go to the September 10th iPhone event
[808.52 → 814.52] because I'm going to have to cover it anyway so I might as well just watch it from the audience
[814.52 → 820.52] instead of here in the comfort of my own home because I hate myself so I reached out to them
[820.52 → 826.52] and I had to I just had to reach out to like genius support for like the iPhone I was like
[826.52 → 832.52] I don't know my iPhone won't update or something anyway so i um right because you have to give them a reason
[832.52 → 837.52] yeah you have to give a reason and the reason can't be I just want to talk to a human being at apple
[837.52 → 843.52] that is not the reason yeah that you're that you may not provide that that reason uh so hold on a second
[843.52 → 849.52] I'm just gonna actually blank this out um I think this is leaked like a hundred times anyway so
[849.52 → 853.52] yeah probably oh wait that's really guessable yeah that's really guessable
[853.52 → 855.52] uh
[855.52 → 861.52] sure you know what why don't we just take all the fun out of it there you go
[861.52 → 868.52] um confirm your Apple ID blah blah blah is this like are you allowed to share private communications
[868.52 → 874.52] they recorded it and in Canada uh it's single party consent so yes I may
[874.52 → 880.52] in California it's not right, but they consented to it and so did I because they said they are recording it
[880.52 → 888.52] but I don't think they consented to you recording it I don't I don't care um all right so I mean if they reach out
[888.52 → 895.52] that would probably be a good yeah maybe we could start a conversation right all right so anyway so you've got to be kidding me
[895.52 → 902.52] oh my goodness
[902.52 → 908.52] okay this is great oh my goodness well I'm glad you're having fun now obs is broken

[985.52 → 987.52] yeah
[987.52 → 991.52] thanks for contacting Apple support my name is whatever my name is
[991.52 → 992.52] uh
[992.52 → 993.52] how can I help you
[993.52 → 994.52] hey
[994.52 → 995.52] Linus
[995.52 → 996.52] how's it going today
[996.52 → 997.52] oh wait is that them two
[997.52 → 998.52] oh it was
[998.52 → 1002.52] great I'm in the media and wanted to know how does one go about getting an invitation to the September event
[1002.52 → 1003.52] I like my YouTube channel
[1003.52 → 1005.52] just to ensure we're on the same page
[1005.52 → 1009.52] you would like to receive an invitation to go to the event in September however you're not sure what the process is and would like to find out
[1009.52 → 1012.52] yeah that's pretty much what I said thank you
[1012.52 → 1015.52] there's no obvious media contact on the site so I ended up coming through here
[1015.52 → 1021.52] I'd be more than happy to assist you to see how best we can work together in hopes of guiding you on a path to resolution
[1021.52 → 1024.52] where this issue you're having is concerned
[1024.52 → 1025.52] what even is that sentence
[1025.52 → 1026.52] that's amazing
[1026.52 → 1027.52] is it okay
[1027.52 → 1028.52] you're talking to a knight
[1028.52 → 1030.52] I know right
[1030.52 → 1032.52] is it okay if I ask a few questions
[1032.52 → 1033.52] sure
[1033.52 → 1034.52] please confirm your Apple ID
[1034.52 → 1035.52] yep
[1035.52 → 1040.52] um I just clarified that I have no idea what Apple ID the phone that I used
[1040.52 → 1043.52] because I had to provide a serial number for a phone in order to talk to apple
[1043.52 → 1044.52] so I just grabbed one from my desk
[1044.52 → 1045.52] like i
[1045.52 → 1048.52] it's not in my daily driver phone I don't even think anything's logged into it
[1048.52 → 1049.52] that's okay
[1049.52 → 1054.52] is it okay if I place you on hold while I consult with my resources to provide you with this information
[1054.52 → 1057.52] so about 10 minutes on hold it's not totally unreasonable
[1057.52 → 1058.52] I'm back
[1058.52 → 1060.52] I have consulted with my resources
[1060.52 → 1062.52] okay
[1062.52 → 1063.52] so you asked someone
[1063.52 → 1067.52] here's a link with the details to attend the function here's a big Apple logo
[1067.52 → 1069.52] don't worry about that
[1069.52 → 1072.52] developer.apple.com slash wwdc19
[1072.52 → 1075.52] which not only is not apple's September event
[1075.52 → 1076.52] policy
[1076.52 → 1080.52] um so it does have the policy for how you attend because you can pay to attend to WWDC
[1080.52 → 1081.52] ah
[1081.52 → 1082.52] but it's WWDC
[1082.52 → 1084.52] not the September launch event
[1084.52 → 1085.52] yeah
[1085.52 → 1086.52] completely different event
[1086.52 → 1087.52] good call
[1087.52 → 1091.52] I go okay that's WWDC is that the wrong link also I am press I am not a developer
[1091.52 → 1094.52] regarding the invite the seats are reserved for the press by invite only
[1094.52 → 1095.52] right
[1095.52 → 1098.52] that is the point of this conversation
[1098.52 → 1100.52] I am the press
[1100.52 → 1102.52] I need a contact at apple
[1102.52 → 1106.52] I don't want to be pushy, but it shouldn't be complicated for me to get a media contact
[1106.52 → 1108.52] we have more views on our mac pro announcement video than you do
[1108.52 → 1111.52] that's
[1111.52 → 1114.52] that's pretty cool that's a good flex
[1114.52 → 1119.52] apple would be the one to reach out to members of the press with an invitation as the function would be for selected members only
[1119.52 → 1122.52] well it would be hard for them to do that if they don't have my contact information
[1122.52 → 1124.52] and I don't have a press relations contact there
[1124.52 → 1126.52] tell you what i have to run to a meeting
[1126.52 → 1129.52] oh bloody hell that's my email it's fine it's leaked a thousand times
[1129.52 → 1131.52] are we all set from here
[1131.52 → 1132.52] oh yeah this is great
[1132.52 → 1134.52] uh if they want to get in touch here's my email
[1134.52 → 1138.52] they go is are we all set from here I just want to know that you're comfortable with the steps I provided
[1138.52 → 1144.52] what steps I wasn't given any steps I need a media contact
[1144.52 → 1148.52] and that was in fact the end of that interaction
[1148.52 → 1150.52] um
[1150.52 → 1154.52] she did arrange to have a supervisor call me
[1154.52 → 1155.52] after
[1155.52 → 1160.52] um, and they informed me actually I don't even remember how that conversation ended
[1160.52 → 1164.52] but basically no there was not in fact anything that they
[1164.52 → 1166.52] uh could or would do about it
[1166.52 → 1168.52] um they said oh right I do remember how it ended
[1168.52 → 1171.52] um it kind of went around in circles like that
[1171.52 → 1173.52] and then I said tell you what
[1173.52 → 1175.52] um
[1175.52 → 1178.52] oh I got an email right I emailed the email nope right okay
[1178.52 → 1182.52] so they said they would see if anyone said cool
[1182.52 → 1184.52] and then they gave me an email that I could contact
[1184.52 → 1187.52] um and then I emailed that email and I never heard back
[1187.52 → 1190.52] right I do remember now good
[1190.52 → 1192.52] so i I'm hopefully not misrepresenting
[1192.52 → 1193.52] that's uh
[1193.52 → 1195.52] how the way in which I was ignored
[1195.52 → 1196.52] that's a beautiful story
[1196.52 → 1200.52] um yeah I thought that was a pretty I thought that was a pretty heartwarming story too
[1200.52 → 1201.52] this bothers me
[1201.52 → 1202.52] um
[1202.52 → 1204.52] oh the fact that this is like a hard edge
[1204.52 → 1205.52] and it's brushed
[1205.52 → 1206.52] yeah
[1206.52 → 1208.52] it's I realize it's I realize it's plastic
[1208.52 → 1210.52] it's not going to stain at least I don't know
[1210.52 → 1213.52] um anyway so I'm not going to the September event
[1213.52 → 1214.52] and uh
[1214.52 → 1217.52] I don't remember how I got on that subject
[1217.52 → 1218.52] um
[1218.52 → 1220.52] we're talking about apple autonomous vehicles
[1220.52 → 1223.52] it doesn't matter you know what Nick's been waiting very patiently
[1223.52 → 1224.52] what can I do for you nick
[1224.52 → 1227.52] um it's actually nothing to do with the show and I just need to ask you something off camera
[1227.52 → 1228.52] oh uh okay
[1228.52 → 1230.52] this mic is aggressively sensitive
[1230.52 → 1231.52] yeah BRB
[1231.52 → 1232.52] just like yeah
[1232.52 → 1233.52] just like yeah
[1233.52 → 1236.52] I've noticed it pickup trucks outside
[1236.52 → 1237.52] be very careful
[1237.52 → 1241.52] I don't know what to talk about while they're gone
[1241.52 → 1242.52] because I don't know how long they're going to be gone
[1242.52 → 1248.52] but probably the next thing we're going to talk about is that there are two folding phones coming in September
[1248.52 → 1252.52] uh that's probably going to be the next topic
[1252.52 → 1254.52] the fold launched in Korea today
[1254.52 → 1259.52] but I believe the're launching in September thing is more talking about the North American market
[1259.52 → 1261.52] or else we would have said that it came out now
[1261.52 → 1265.52] Huawei has confirmed the launch date for its next flagship phone line
[1265.52 → 1270.52] the mate 30 series will be unveiled in Munich, Germany on September 19th
[1270.52 → 1271.52] so we'll figure that out soon
[1271.52 → 1274.52] maybe it won't be September, but we'll figure it out soon
[1274.52 → 1276.52] oftentimes these events have been like
[1276.52 → 1279.52] and it's coming now or something
[1279.52 → 1281.52] so it'll probably be fairly soon
[1281.52 → 1286.52] Samsung is finally ready to unveil their refined Galaxy Fold
[1286.52 → 1291.52] after an embarrassing initial rollout earlier this year that was plagued with multiple damage review units
[1291.52 → 1294.52] they said in July that the fold would be available in September
[1294.52 → 1298.52] so theoretically that's nourish which would be cool
[1298.52 → 1299.52] is everything all good?
[1299.52 → 1300.52] uh yeah
[1300.52 → 1301.52] cool
[1301.52 → 1303.52] we're talking about two folding phones launching in September
[1303.52 → 1306.52] um yeah both of which were supposed to launch ages ago
[1306.52 → 1307.52] yeah
[1307.52 → 1308.52] um yeah
[1308.52 → 1310.52] so who knows if they'll even launch now
[1310.52 → 1312.52] well the fold launched in Korea already
[1312.52 → 1314.52] but then like it might launch
[1314.52 → 1319.52] like the curious thing about all of this is that I haven't seen like
[1319.52 → 1322.52] they were treating the fold as this global launch event
[1322.52 → 1328.52] and press all over the world had review units ahead of time so that there would be coverage
[1328.52 → 1331.52] so that people would get hyped about it so that they would um
[1331.52 → 1333.52] which was so suicidal
[1333.52 → 1336.52] so that they would be incentivized to go and buy it on launch day and all this kind of stuff
[1336.52 → 1337.52] they must have known how volatile they were
[1337.52 → 1340.52] and now they've just-no I think they just didn't
[1340.52 → 1343.52] well I think the people making the decision just didn't
[1343.52 → 1344.52] right
[1344.52 → 1345.52] accept it
[1345.52 → 1346.52] we've seen that a few times
[1346.52 → 1347.52] yeah we've seen that before
[1347.52 → 1348.52] yeah yeah yeah
[1348.52 → 1350.52] so this time it seems like they're doing a quiet launch
[1350.52 → 1353.52] and it is pretty common for um
[1353.52 → 1354.52] not just Samsung
[1354.52 → 1357.52] I'm trying to think like other Korean companies have done this before too
[1357.52 → 1359.52] to just quietly launch something in Korea
[1359.52 → 1360.52] yeah
[1360.52 → 1364.52] um where I don't know I guess their customers are a little more forgiving if something sucks
[1364.52 → 1369.52] or the volumes are lower so they can control the damage if it turns out
[1369.52 → 1370.52] home turf is definitely a thing
[1370.52 → 1371.52] disaster yeah yeah
[1371.52 → 1374.52] so it seems like they've just done a quiet launch in Korea
[1374.52 → 1376.52] did you already cover the updates to this one?
[1376.52 → 1377.52] uh no that's where I am
[1377.52 → 1380.52] okay cool so they did a quiet launch in Korea and um
[1380.52 → 1381.52] seems like they've made a few changes
[1381.52 → 1385.52] so caps were added to the top and bottom edges of the hinge to seal off the gaps that
[1385.52 → 1387.52] previously might have allowed dust into the mechanism
[1387.52 → 1390.52] the layer that people mistook for a screen protector and peeled off
[1390.52 → 1394.52] now extends beyond the edges of the screen and tucks under the bezel
[1394.52 → 1396.52] so there aren't any bits exposed
[1396.52 → 1399.52] and they added layers of metal under the display to strengthen its protection
[1399.52 → 1404.52] and hopefully make it so you won't be able to feel the machinery beneath the screen when you poke at it
[1404.52 → 1405.52] yeah
[1405.52 → 1409.52] uh with the updates the fold also locks into place more rigidly than before
[1409.52 → 1412.52] and it's almost completely 180 degrees flat when it's open
[1412.52 → 1416.52] uh the stronger lock also makes the device less floppy when you're holding the open phone with one hand
[1416.52 → 1423.52] I love that they said that because this whole time I've been hoping that a derogatory term for these phones ends up being floppy phones
[1423.52 → 1424.52] floppy phones
[1424.52 → 1426.52] because it's just great
[1426.52 → 1427.52] flop phone
[1427.52 → 1428.52] that's not bad
[1428.52 → 1429.52] a flop phone
[1429.52 → 1430.52] yeah
[1430.52 → 1431.52] flip phone flop phone
[1431.52 → 1432.52] yeah
[1432.52 → 1433.52] flip-flop
[1433.52 → 1434.52] I like it
[1434.52 → 1435.52] and it's not bad
[1435.52 → 1438.52] to reduce the gap between the folds hinge and body so it isn't as thick when it's closed as it was before
[1438.52 → 1442.52] no word on when the rollout will be expanded to the U.S. and internationally
[1442.52 → 1443.52] um
[1443.52 → 1446.52] now we should go through our sponsor bits, and then what were those topics that I wanted to talk about
[1446.52 → 1449.52] I want to talk about how I'm like into VR again and then there's another thing
[1449.52 → 1450.52] yeah
[1450.52 → 1451.52] I know the VR thing
[1451.52 → 1452.52] what was the other one
[1452.52 → 1454.52] ah maybe someone in chat remembered
[1454.52 → 1455.52] oh uh we're doing a video soon
[1455.52 → 1456.52] oh yeah
[1456.52 → 1459.52] okay so we'll talk about that after we go through our sponsors
[1459.52 → 1462.52] uh the show today is brought to you by Back blaze

[1504.52 → 1511.52] we're not yet, but we've been considering potentially maybe possibly working with Back blaze as float plane
[1511.52 → 1512.52] oh really
[1512.52 → 1513.52] yeah
[1513.52 → 1514.52] oh that's pretty cool
[1514.52 → 1515.52] it's just been considered
[1515.52 → 1516.52] that would be great
[1516.52 → 1517.52] it's been tabled
[1517.52 → 1520.52] I haven't like gone anywhere, but I found it interesting that they're a sponsor
[1520.52 → 1521.52] yeah
[1521.52 → 1522.52] FreshBooks

[1559.52 → 1561.52] it's also brought to you by Pulse way

[1567.52 → 1569.52] it's compatible with Windows, Mac and Linux

[1594.52 → 1596.52] in the defence of the writing of that
[1596.52 → 1602.52] I think if someone's going to use Pulse way they can probably assume what remote desktop functionality could benefit them
[1602.52 → 1604.52] okay I got a super chat here that I actually want to talk about
[1604.52 → 1605.52] this is Quintuple A
[1605.52 → 1610.52] back at CES you were super hyped about Hi sense's double LCD USED technology
[1610.52 → 1612.52] will you ever review one of their TVs?
[1612.52 → 1616.52] I don't know how much I can say
[1616.52 → 1621.52] because I signed an NDA
[1621.52 → 1626.52] but I am still
[1626.52 → 1630.52] I feel exactly the same way about USED technology as I did
[1630.52 → 1637.52] and when and if Hi sense were to ever release any kind of product based around that technological concept
[1637.52 → 1641.52] I would be super amped to check it out
[1641.52 → 1648.52] especially if they had some like perfect ideas for how they could make it better
[1648.52 → 1653.52] next topic
[1653.52 → 1654.52] yeah let's move on
[1654.52 → 1656.52] Apple and Google to hand over guns
[1656.52 → 1657.52] no I want to talk about VR
[1657.52 → 1658.52] okay
[1658.52 → 1660.52] we did the title topic I don't care anymore
[1660.52 → 1661.52] yeah we did the title topic
[1661.52 → 1662.52] yeah so like
[1662.52 → 1664.52] it's cool again
[1664.52 → 1665.52] it's kind of cool again
[1665.52 → 1666.52] yeah
[1666.52 → 1667.52] um
[1667.52 → 1669.52] I'm getting back into it too
[1669.52 → 1672.52] I think taking a break was the right idea
[1672.52 → 1674.52] and then now I'm genuinely re-excited about things
[1674.52 → 1678.52] because a bunch of fascinating stuff has happened
[1678.52 → 1682.52] so INDEX is a legit second-gen experience
[1682.52 → 1683.52] Five Pro was not
[1683.52 → 1684.52] yes
[1684.52 → 1685.52] no
[1685.52 → 1686.52] I was really upset about Five Pro
[1686.52 → 1688.52] because it was
[1688.52 → 1689.52] like
[1689.52 → 1690.52] Five Pro is lame
[1690.52 → 1692.52] everything I didn't ask for
[1692.52 → 1694.52] and nothing that I did ask for
[1694.52 → 1695.52] okay one thing I asked for
[1695.52 → 1697.52] okay the screen resolution was better
[1697.52 → 1702.52] but Five Pro by HTC's own admission was
[1702.52 → 1704.52] Five but professional
[1704.52 → 1706.52] it was not Five 2
[1706.52 → 1708.52] and I wanted an upgrade
[1708.52 → 1711.52] like when did the HTC Five come out?
[1711.52 → 1713.52] let's just check this
[1713.52 → 1714.52] uh
[1714.52 → 1715.52] 2014?
[1715.52 → 1717.52] HTC Five
[1717.52 → 1719.52] release date
[1719.52 → 1722.52] like it was a long frigging time ago
[1722.52 → 1723.52] I don't think it was 2014
[1723.52 → 1725.52] it was like 2016
[1725.52 → 1727.52] 2016?
[1727.52 → 1729.52] why is my internet taking so long?
[1729.52 → 1731.52] oh yeah no
[1731.52 → 1732.52] dang it
[1732.52 → 1734.52] I'm gonna re-guess at 2015
[1734.52 → 1735.52] what?
[1735.52 → 1738.52] you don't just get to re-guess
[1738.52 → 1739.52] okay, okay okay, okay
[1739.52 → 1741.52] I was thinking of
[1741.52 → 1743.52] besides you're going to be right if I went over anyway
[1743.52 → 1744.52] because price is right
[1744.52 → 1745.52] rules
[1745.52 → 1746.52] oh apparently
[1746.52 → 1747.52] alright that's fine
[1747.52 → 1748.52] I can oh wait are we still
[1748.52 → 1750.52] we are still transitioning from the desktop
[1750.52 → 1751.52] cool okay
[1751.52 → 1752.52] well I don't know how that works
[1752.52 → 1753.52] oh maybe the Wi-Fi went down again
[1753.52 → 1754.52] fantastic
[1754.52 → 1755.52] that's fine
[1755.52 → 1756.52] uh HTC
[1756.52 → 1757.52] I'm on my mobile date that's fine
[1757.52 → 1758.52] I got this
[1758.52 → 1759.52] mobile HTC Five release date
[1759.52 → 1760.52] um
[1760.52 → 1761.52] oh man
[1762.52 → 1763.52] 2016
[1763.52 → 1764.52] you're right
[1764.52 → 1765.52] heck yeah
[1765.52 → 1766.52] wow I'm awesome
[1766.52 → 1767.52] I thought it was so long ago
[1767.52 → 1769.52] but I'm thinking I think Crystal Cove
[1769.52 → 1772.52] Dev Kits went out in August and September 2015
[1772.52 → 1773.52] um
[1773.52 → 1774.52] mmm
[1774.52 → 1775.52] but like
[1775.52 → 1778.52] that's still a long time ago
[1778.52 → 1779.52] yeah
[1779.52 → 1780.52] that's like three years ago
[1780.52 → 1781.52] so when the Five Pro came out
[1781.52 → 1782.52] like I was
[1782.52 → 1783.52] I was expecting
[1783.52 → 1785.52] VR to be like this
[1785.52 → 1787.52] rapidly iterating technology
[1787.52 → 1789.52] because around that time
[1789.52 → 1794.52] that was in the midst of the mobile display pixel density race
[1794.52 → 1795.52] right
[1795.52 → 1796.52] like that was when
[1796.52 → 1801.52] you know Sony was shipping a 4k phone
[1801.52 → 1802.52] and I was like
[1802.52 → 1803.52] we're
[1803.52 → 1804.52] screens
[1804.52 → 1806.52] they're going to get super dense
[1806.52 → 1807.52] and OLED technology
[1807.52 → 1809.52] it's going to be super low persistence
[1809.52 → 1810.52] and like
[1810.52 → 1811.52] it's going to be
[1811.52 → 1812.52] it's going to be flipping awesome
[1812.52 → 1813.52] and then it just
[1813.52 → 1814.52] stopped
[1814.52 → 1817.52] in 2017 I guessed five years
[1817.52 → 1819.52] for what?
[1819.52 → 1821.52] for VR to like really be popping
[1821.52 → 1824.52] yeah I could see that
[1824.52 → 1826.52] they crossed the 1% threshold
[1826.52 → 1829.52] for install base in the Steam Hardware Survey
[1829.52 → 1830.52] not bad
[1830.52 → 1831.52] heck yeah
[1831.52 → 1832.52] working on it
[1832.52 → 1834.52] and more importantly
[1834.52 → 1836.52] some of the technologies that
[1836.52 → 1837.52] I did not
[1837.52 → 1839.52] have a lot of faith in
[1839.52 → 1841.52] are starting to show promise
[1841.52 → 1843.52] so have you tried the Oculus Quest?
[1843.52 → 1845.52] no but I've read a lot about it
[1845.52 → 1847.52] I haven't tried it myself
[1847.52 → 1849.52] and I've talked to a guy that uses it
[1849.52 → 1850.52] basically all the time
[1850.52 → 1851.52] okay
[1851.52 → 1852.52] it's only 72 hertz or whatever
[1852.52 → 1854.52] do you know the picture of the guy and his son
[1854.52 → 1855.52] standing by their Tesla
[1855.52 → 1856.52] at a Tesla charging station
[1856.52 → 1858.52] and they're both playing the Quest
[1858.52 → 1859.52] it went trending not that long ago
[1859.52 → 1860.52] no I didn't see that
[1860.52 → 1862.52] oh I like hung out with him for a while
[1862.52 → 1863.52] okay
[1863.52 → 1864.52] he's actually really cool
[1864.52 → 1865.52] he actually lives locally
[1865.52 → 1866.52] alright
[1866.52 → 1867.52] but the yeah anyway
[1867.52 → 1869.52] so the Quest
[1869.52 → 1871.52] it's only 72 hertz
[1871.52 → 1873.52] it's running on like
[1873.52 → 1875.52] Snapdragon 835 or whatever
[1875.52 → 1876.52] like it's not even
[1876.52 → 1878.52] is it 835?
[1878.52 → 1880.52] Oculus Quest
[1880.52 → 1881.52] Snap
[1881.52 → 1882.52] Dragon
[1884.52 → 1885.52] is it 845?
[1885.52 → 1886.52] it's not 855
[1886.52 → 1887.52] that's for sure
[1887.52 → 1888.52] uh
[1888.52 → 1890.52] oh no 835
[1890.52 → 1891.52] yeah 835
[1891.52 → 1892.52] um
[1892.52 → 1893.52] so it's like
[1893.52 → 1894.52] ancient technology
[1894.52 → 1895.52] and mobile
[1895.52 → 1896.52] ugh
[1896.52 → 1897.52] ugh
[1897.52 → 1898.52] um
[1898.52 → 1899.52] but
[1899.52 → 1902.52] depending on the type of game
[1902.52 → 1904.52] not everything is a great experience
[1904.52 → 1906.52] but depending on the type of game
[1906.52 → 1907.52] it is
[1907.52 → 1908.52] shockingly good
[1908.52 → 1910.52] and not having the
[1910.52 → 1911.52] the weight of the
[1911.52 → 1913.52] and the inconvenience of the tether
[1913.52 → 1914.52] the tether yeah
[1914.52 → 1916.52] like it is so much better
[1916.52 → 1919.52] than the mobile based VR experiences
[1919.52 → 1920.52] that I had had in the past
[1920.52 → 1921.52] which is just garbage
[1921.52 → 1923.52] that I was blown away
[1923.52 → 1924.52] like the tracking
[1924.52 → 1926.52] is so good
[1926.52 → 1927.52] and
[1927.52 → 1929.52] after my experience with
[1929.52 → 1930.52] I'm saying a lot of the things
[1930.52 → 1931.52] that I'm going to repeat
[1931.52 → 1932.52] in my upcoming review
[1932.52 → 1933.52] of the Rift S
[1933.52 → 1934.52] as well as the upcoming
[1934.52 → 1935.52] uh
[1935.52 → 1936.52] video about the Quest
[1936.52 → 1937.52] I believe it's on Float plane
[1937.52 → 1938.52] I'm sorry?
[1938.52 → 1939.52] I think it's on Float plane right?
[1939.52 → 1940.52] uh
[1940.52 → 1941.52] Quest yes
[1941.52 → 1942.52] Quest? Okay
[1942.52 → 1943.52] Rift S I have not actually shot
[1943.52 → 1944.52] but I have fully written
[1944.52 → 1945.52] I finished writing it last night
[1945.52 → 1946.52] um
[1946.52 → 1947.52] so
[1947.52 → 1948.52] yeah there's a plug for Float plane
[1948.52 → 1949.52] if you subscribe on Float plane
[1949.52 → 1950.52] it's like weakfish
[1950.52 → 1951.52] early access
[1951.52 → 1952.52] and occasional
[1952.52 → 1953.52] uh
[1953.52 → 1954.52] exclusive content
[1954.52 → 1955.52] we're not trying to oversell it
[1955.52 → 1956.52] it's a way to support
[1956.52 → 1957.52] Minus Tech Tips
[1957.52 → 1958.52] the meet the team videos
[1958.52 → 1959.52] are pretty cool
[1959.52 → 1960.52] um
[1960.52 → 1961.52] so
[1961.52 → 1962.52] the tracking on it
[1962.52 → 1963.52] the
[1963.52 → 1964.52] the
[1964.52 → 1965.52] the freedom of being able
[1965.52 → 1966.52] to like to wander around
[1966.52 → 1967.52] in a gigantic
[1967.52 → 1969.52] play space
[1969.52 → 1970.52] uh
[1970.52 → 1971.52] compared to what I'm used to
[1971.52 → 1972.52] because I mean theoretically
[1972.52 → 1973.52] on my index
[1973.52 → 1974.52] yeah
[1974.52 → 1976.52] I could have like a 15 by 15
[1976.52 → 1977.52] play space or whatever
[1977.52 → 1978.52] the stupid like maximum size
[1978.52 → 1979.52] is ridiculous
[1979.52 → 1981.52] with what tether
[1981.52 → 1982.52] yeah
[1982.52 → 1983.52] what like powered active
[1983.52 → 1984.52] display port repeaters
[1984.52 → 1985.52] every five meter
[1985.52 → 1986.52] like what
[1986.52 → 1987.52] it's not even
[1987.52 → 1989.52] like it's not even a real conversation
[1989.52 → 1990.52] you know what I mean
[1990.52 → 1991.52] yeah yeah yeah
[1991.52 → 1992.52] um
[1992.52 → 1993.52] because wireless isn't feasible for it yet
[1993.52 → 1994.52] the
[1994.52 → 1995.52] the resolution and refresh rate
[1995.52 → 1996.52] are just too high
[1996.52 → 1997.52] it's too much bandwidth
[1997.52 → 1998.52] until we get another revision
[1998.52 → 1999.52] of 60
[1999.52 → 2001.52] 60 gigahertz Wi-Fi
[2001.52 → 2002.52] um
[2002.52 → 2005.52] so it was just kind of surreal
[2005.52 → 2006.52] and playing something like
[2006.52 → 2007.52] Beat Safer
[2007.52 → 2008.52] which I always come back to
[2008.52 → 2009.52] because it's
[2009.52 → 2010.52] casual enough
[2010.52 → 2011.52] that it runs on mobile hardware
[2011.52 → 2012.52] but it's hardcore enough
[2012.52 → 2013.52] in that
[2013.52 → 2014.52] it is like a
[2014.52 → 2015.52] genuinely
[2015.52 → 2016.52] skill requiring game
[2016.52 → 2017.52] yeah yeah yeah
[2017.52 → 2018.52] um
[2018.52 → 2019.52] solo competitive
[2019.52 → 2020.52] it's, and it's very sensitive
[2020.52 → 2021.52] to
[2021.52 → 2022.52] uh
[2022.52 → 2023.52] uh
[2023.52 → 2026.52] to errors in tracking for the controllers
[2026.52 → 2027.52] or for latency issues
[2027.52 → 2028.52] I'm like playing
[2028.52 → 2030.52] it's great
[2030.52 → 2031.52] it's great
[2031.52 → 2032.52] for certain experiences
[2032.52 → 2033.52] that's cool
[2033.52 → 2035.52] and after my experience with Windows Mixed Reality
[2035.52 → 2036.52] right
[2036.52 → 2037.52] that's where I was going with that
[2037.52 → 2039.52] I had no faith in inside out tracking
[2039.52 → 2040.52] mmm
[2040.52 → 2041.52] I thought it was dead on arrival
[2041.52 → 2042.52] I was like
[2042.52 → 2044.52] they will not fix the occlusion issues
[2044.52 → 2045.52] uh
[2045.52 → 2046.52] they will not fix the drift
[2046.52 → 2047.52] really
[2047.52 → 2048.52] we're done here
[2048.52 → 2049.52] I'm so okay
[2049.52 → 2050.52] I was very pessimistic
[2050.52 → 2051.52] I wasn't
[2051.52 → 2052.52] okay
[2052.52 → 2053.52] well then
[2053.52 → 2054.52] you were smarter than me
[2054.52 → 2055.52] good for you
[2055.52 → 2056.52] hooray
[2056.52 → 2057.52] I'm just
[2057.52 → 2058.52] I didn't
[2058.52 → 2059.52] I haven't heard you say that before
[2059.52 → 2060.52] that's why I'm surprised
[2060.52 → 2061.52] I thought outside in
[2061.52 → 2062.52] was always going to be
[2062.52 → 2063.52] the premium experience
[2065.52 → 2066.52] it is though still
[2066.52 → 2067.52] but
[2067.52 → 2069.52] Rift S
[2069.52 → 2070.52] have you tried it
[2070.52 → 2071.52] uh
[2071.52 → 2072.52] okay
[2072.52 → 2073.52] okay
[2073.52 → 2074.52] still no
[2074.52 → 2075.52] but there was one at PAX
[2075.52 → 2076.52] that my brother tried
[2076.52 → 2077.52] and there was clear and obvious issues with it
[2077.52 → 2078.52] okay
[2078.52 → 2079.52] but was that at PAX
[2079.52 → 2082.52] no it was because of the headset
[2082.52 → 2084.52] because there are areas where it doesn't track well
[2084.52 → 2085.52] okay
[2085.52 → 2086.52] you should come over
[2086.52 → 2087.52] and try it
[2087.52 → 2088.52] sure
[2088.52 → 2089.52] or just take it home
[2089.52 → 2090.52] it's in my office
[2090.52 → 2091.52] it has to come back on Monday
[2091.52 → 2092.52] because I'm shooting that video on Monday
[2092.52 → 2093.52] there's like no room in my house
[2093.52 → 2094.52] there's like no point
[2094.52 → 2095.52] okay
[2095.52 → 2096.52] well the thing about the Rift S though
[2096.52 → 2098.52] is that it doesn't need room
[2099.52 → 2100.52] you just
[2100.52 → 2101.52] put it on
[2101.52 → 2102.52] yeah okay
[2102.52 → 2103.52] I could
[2103.52 → 2104.52] there are no lighthouses
[2104.52 → 2105.52] there's no setup
[2105.52 → 2107.52] I wonder if I could get them to send me the build of the game
[2107.52 → 2108.52] but there's there's a football game
[2108.52 → 2109.52] okay
[2109.52 → 2110.52] and the whole idea
[2110.52 → 2111.52] it was sevens football
[2111.52 → 2112.52] so it's passing only
[2112.52 → 2113.52] and all this kind of stuff
[2113.52 → 2114.52] I don't remember the name of it
[2114.52 → 2115.52] I'm sorry if you're watching this
[2115.52 → 2116.52] um
[2116.52 → 2117.52] but they were at PAX
[2117.52 → 2118.52] they're releasing the game relatively soon I think
[2118.52 → 2119.52] but so you're the quarterback
[2119.52 → 2120.52] you have to throw the ball
[2120.52 → 2121.52] okay
[2121.52 → 2123.52] and the only way they're able to run it
[2123.52 → 2124.52] oh yeah okay
[2124.52 → 2125.52] it's cause you go here
[2125.52 → 2126.52] and you couldn't throw it
[2126.52 → 2127.52] so the whole time I was like
[2127.52 → 2129.52] why did you guys bring this headset
[2129.52 → 2130.52] like what
[2130.52 → 2131.52] this is so dumb
[2131.52 → 2132.52] cause you watch everyone play this football game
[2132.52 → 2133.52] and they're like yeah
[2133.52 → 2134.52] it tracks properly if you throw the ball properly
[2134.52 → 2137.52] we have it modded right now so you can go beep
[2137.52 → 2139.52] and I'm like that's so dumb
[2139.52 → 2140.52] okay
[2140.52 → 2143.52] there are games
[2143.52 → 2144.52] that have issues
[2144.52 → 2145.52] I will give you that
[2145.52 → 2146.52] yeah
[2146.52 → 2148.52] none of the things I play regularly
[2148.52 → 2149.52] require me to put my hand behind my head
[2149.52 → 2151.52] the only thing I'm saying is you said
[2151.52 → 2152.52] okay
[2152.52 → 2153.52] I thought
[2153.52 → 2155.52] the other version of tracking would always be better
[2155.52 → 2156.52] I'm like well yeah
[2156.52 → 2158.52] I think that's probably solvable
[2158.52 → 2159.52] because the thing too
[2159.52 → 2162.52] is that the Rift S and the Quest
[2162.52 → 2164.52] get a lot of their location data
[2164.52 → 2166.52] from the accelerometer and gyroscope
[2166.52 → 2168.52] in the controller
[2168.52 → 2169.52] I don't think it's unsolvable
[2169.52 → 2170.52] so it's solvable
[2170.52 → 2173.52] and then what it's doing is it's using the constellation map
[2173.52 → 2176.52] from the headset to the controllers
[2176.52 → 2177.52] yeah
[2177.52 → 2178.52] to correct
[2178.52 → 2179.52] yeah
[2179.52 → 2182.52] so as long as you are only occluded for a short period of time
[2182.52 → 2184.52] theoretically it should be fine
[2184.52 → 2186.52] and in my experience using it in my living room
[2186.52 → 2188.52] it was very good
[2188.52 → 2191.52] I did get some itchiness like when I first put it on
[2191.52 → 2193.52] but then
[2193.52 → 2195.52] it would kind of settle in
[2195.52 → 2197.52] and I couldn't tell
[2197.52 → 2198.52] in fact
[2198.52 → 2199.52] Hollow Ball
[2199.52 → 2202.52] is a game that I have kind of used as my benchmark
[2202.52 → 2203.52] for
[2203.52 → 2205.52] controller tracking
[2205.52 → 2206.52] because I
[2206.52 → 2208.52] as a badminton player
[2208.52 → 2210.52] I tend to flick my wrist
[2210.52 → 2212.52] rather than swing my arm
[2212.52 → 2213.52] when I'm trying to hit a ball
[2213.52 → 2214.52] yeah
[2214.52 → 2218.52] and that game is obviously designed around a tennis swing
[2218.52 → 2219.52] an arm swing
[2219.52 → 2220.52] because otherwise
[2220.52 → 2222.52] it is utterly hopeless
[2222.52 → 2223.52] at tracking where your hand is
[2223.52 → 2224.52] it's too fast
[2224.52 → 2225.52] right
[2225.52 → 2227.52] and so like I can swing right through the ball
[2227.52 → 2228.52] I can watch the paddle go through
[2228.52 → 2229.52] like it just doesn't work
[2229.52 → 2230.52] yeah yeah
[2230.52 → 2233.52] and what I found was on the Rift S
[2233.52 → 2236.52] I was way more likely to hit the ball
[2236.52 → 2238.52] like worlds more likely
[2238.52 → 2239.52] and Oculus claims
[2239.52 → 2241.52] or I should say Facebook at this point
[2241.52 → 2243.52] their last founding member was out as of I think like a couple of weeks ago
[2243.52 → 2244.52] Oh really?
[2244.52 → 2245.52] Yeah
[2245.52 → 2246.52] so Facebook claims
[2246.52 → 2248.52] that they are updating their location
[2248.52 → 2250.52] with one millisecond granularity
[2250.52 → 2252.52] now it's not a perfect update
[2252.52 → 2253.52] because the cameras
[2253.52 → 2254.52] If you can see the racket go through the ball
[2254.52 → 2256.52] I'm suspecting this is a collision issue
[2256.52 → 2257.52] and not a tracking issue
[2257.52 → 2258.52] could be
[2258.52 → 2260.52] if you see the racket go through the ball
[2260.52 → 2261.52] okay I should clarify
[2261.52 → 2263.52] I see where the racket is
[2263.52 → 2264.52] okay
[2264.52 → 2266.52] I see that I followed through
[2266.52 → 2268.52] and I see that the ball went through where I was going
[2268.52 → 2269.52] okay
[2269.52 → 2270.52] so no
[2270.52 → 2271.52] it's not like I see the models
[2271.52 → 2272.52] yeah yeah
[2272.52 → 2273.52] okay
[2273.52 → 2274.52] but so on the
[2274.52 → 2275.52] so anyway
[2275.52 → 2276.52] so it's every
[2276.52 → 2277.52] it's 30 times a second with the camera
[2277.52 → 2279.52] so that's where it's checking for drift
[2279.52 → 2280.52] yeah
[2280.52 → 2281.52] and then it's apparently
[2281.52 → 2282.52] I have no way of validating it
[2282.52 → 2284.52] but apparently millisecond granularity
[2284.52 → 2285.52] from the gyroscope
[2285.52 → 2286.52] yeah
[2286.52 → 2287.52] and accelerometer
[2287.52 → 2288.52] it seems reasonable
[2288.52 → 2291.52] and I did find that it was better
[2291.52 → 2292.52] that's cool
[2292.52 → 2293.52] that's cool
[2293.52 → 2294.52] but they dropped it to 80 hertz
[2294.52 → 2295.52] hmm
[2295.52 → 2296.52] yeah
[2296.52 → 2297.52] and like I
[2297.52 → 2298.52] you were there
[2298.52 → 2299.52] the second I put the index on
[2299.52 → 2301.52] holy crap
[2301.52 → 2302.52] it's so
[2302.52 → 2303.52] it's so much better
[2303.52 → 2304.52] intensely noticeable
[2304.52 → 2305.52] the resolution
[2305.52 → 2306.52] the refresh rate
[2306.52 → 2307.52] everything
[2307.52 → 2308.52] it's amazing
[2308.52 → 2309.52] even the
[2309.52 → 2310.52] the like safe zones
[2310.52 → 2312.52] I have a really hard problem with headsets
[2312.52 → 2313.52] where if they're not tilted
[2313.52 → 2314.52] and
[2314.52 → 2317.52] not tilted to the exact specification
[2317.52 → 2318.52] and exactly far enough away
[2318.52 → 2319.52] then they look like
[2319.52 → 2320.52] they look terrible to me
[2320.52 → 2321.52] right
[2321.52 → 2322.52] it's probably because my eyes suck
[2322.52 → 2323.52] but whatever
[2323.52 → 2324.52] and then the index
[2324.52 → 2325.52] it didn't really matter
[2325.52 → 2326.52] I threw it on
[2326.52 → 2327.52] and while it was coming on
[2327.52 → 2328.52] I was like
[2328.52 → 2329.52] everything's perfect
[2329.52 → 2330.52] and then I sit it down
[2330.52 → 2331.52] I'm like
[2331.52 → 2332.52] everything's still perfect
[2332.52 → 2333.52] but it's a thousand dollars
[2333.52 → 2334.52] but yeah
[2334.52 → 2335.52] it's a thousand dollars
[2335.52 → 2336.52] anyway
[2336.52 → 2338.52] all of this is why I'm really excited about
[2338.52 → 2339.52] what's happening right now
[2339.52 → 2341.52] because we finally have
[2341.52 → 2342.52] a real upgrade at the high end
[2342.52 → 2343.52] yeah
[2343.52 → 2344.52] with the index
[2344.52 → 2345.52] yeah
[2345.52 → 2347.52] and a good solid solution
[2347.52 → 2348.52] that isn't there
[2348.52 → 2349.52] yes
[2349.52 → 2351.52] because I've always
[2351.52 → 2352.52] kind of detested
[2352.52 → 2354.52] I remember I made a big part
[2354.52 → 2356.52] in a video about this a long time ago
[2356.52 → 2358.52] about how I was kind of annoyed
[2358.52 → 2359.52] with all these different phone companies
[2359.52 → 2360.52] and stuff
[2360.52 → 2361.52] advertising
[2361.52 → 2362.52] mobile VR
[2362.52 → 2363.52] so I was like
[2363.52 → 2364.52] now everyone's going to think
[2364.52 → 2365.52] this is what VR is
[2365.52 → 2366.52] yeah
[2366.52 → 2368.52] and that was really frustrating
[2368.52 → 2370.52] but hopefully we're leaving that era
[2370.52 → 2372.52] where VR is just good
[2372.52 → 2373.52] good
[2375.52 → 2376.52] okay
[2376.52 → 2379.52] hey someone pointed out in the super chats
[2379.52 → 2382.52] that the Apple Media helpline is apparently listed on
[2382.52 → 2384.52] apple.com slash leadership
[2384.52 → 2386.52] which has all their executives
[2386.52 → 2389.52] and their board of directors
[2389.52 → 2390.52] yes
[2390.52 → 2391.52] that's just help
[2391.52 → 2392.52] that's not
[2392.52 → 2393.52] it is indeed there
[2393.52 → 2394.52] like it's a generic thing
[2394.52 → 2395.52] yeah yeah yeah
[2395.52 → 2397.52] but I believe that is actually the email address
[2397.52 → 2399.52] that I was eventually provided
[2399.52 → 2400.52] so
[2400.52 → 2401.52] thank you
[2401.52 → 2403.52] that is legitimately quite helpful
[2403.52 → 2404.52] I appreciate it
[2405.52 → 2406.52] thank you for the super chat
[2406.52 → 2407.52] unfortunately
[2407.52 → 2408.52] I doubt
[2408.52 → 2409.52] I mean
[2409.52 → 2411.52] I will call it
[2411.52 → 2412.52] I'll call it
[2412.52 → 2413.52] oh yeah yeah
[2413.52 → 2414.52] I'll see
[2414.52 → 2415.52] you should call it now
[2415.52 → 2416.52] should I?
[2416.52 → 2417.52] I think that would be great
[2417.52 → 2418.52] I think that would be awesome
[2418.52 → 2419.52] alright
[2419.52 → 2420.52] probably close
[2420.52 → 2421.52] but like
[2421.52 → 2422.52] I don't know
[2422.52 → 2423.52] I don't know
[2423.52 → 2424.52] I mean
[2424.52 → 2425.52] give it a shot
[2425.52 → 2426.52] like 47 billion dollars
[2426.52 → 2427.52] in the bank
[2427.52 → 2428.52] actually I think it's a lot more than that
[2428.52 → 2429.52] I think that's Facebook
[2429.52 → 2431.52] that has about 45 billion in the bank right now
[2431.52 → 2433.52] I don't remember how much Apple has
[2433.52 → 2438.52] I'm sure they can afford to pay someone to answer important media inquiries late at night
[2438.52 → 2441.52] 285.1 billion dollars
[2441.52 → 2444.52] alright
[2444.52 → 2448.52] so I'm not going to put them on speaker until I get consent here
[2448.52 → 2450.52] do you want to cover the next news topic?
[2450.52 → 2451.52] sure
[2451.52 → 2452.52] yeah yeah yeah
[2452.52 → 2453.52] okay
[2453.52 → 2455.52] we can do an Apple topic
[2455.52 → 2458.52] Apple and Google to hand over gun scope app user data
[2458.52 → 2460.52] so these gun scopes they could like
[2460.52 → 2463.52] I believe they could be remotely viewed
[2463.52 → 2467.52] so you could like to see through the gun scope on your phone or something like that
[2467.52 → 2470.52] and they have some other kind of neat information
[2470.52 → 2473.52] the information that they're potentially passing forward
[2473.52 → 2477.52] the US government has ordered them to hand over
[2477.52 → 2480.52] names phone numbers and IP addresses
[2480.52 → 2483.52] of at least 10,000 users of a single gun scope app
[2483.52 → 2487.52] made by night vision specialist American Technologies Network Corp.
[2487.52 → 2488.52] I'm assuming they weren't there
[2488.52 → 2494.52] it's just a voicemail where you leave your email address your message your name and your media outlet number
[2494.52 → 2496.52] which I clearly don't have
[2496.52 → 2497.52] nice
[2497.52 → 2499.52] and they will get back to you
[2499.52 → 2502.52] ultimately you can email media. Help at apple.com
[2502.52 → 2503.52] awesome
[2503.52 → 2505.52] so basically it's effectively emailing them
[2505.52 → 2506.52] yes
[2506.52 → 2510.52] so the app specifically allowed them to get a live stream of the scope
[2510.52 → 2513.52] take video like so record the scope I guess
[2513.52 → 2517.52] and calibrate their scope from an Android or iPhone device
[2517.52 → 2520.52] it's been downloaded more than 10,000 times on Android
[2520.52 → 2523.52] Apple doesn't provide the numbers
[2523.52 → 2533.52] ICE or Immigration and Customs Enforcement is seeking information as part of a broad investigation into possible breaches of weapons export regulations
[2533.52 → 2542.52] so I think the idea is they're trying to figure out where these things are getting registered so they can figure out if they're getting sold somewhere that they shouldn't be being sold
[2542.52 → 2543.52] interesting
[2543.52 → 2544.52] if that makes sense
[2544.52 → 2546.52] I believe that is the goal
[2546.52 → 2554.52] if Apple and Google decide to hand over the information it could include data on thousands of people who have nothing to do with the crimes being investigated
[2554.52 → 2559.52] which could it say in here set a dangerous precedent
[2559.52 → 2561.52] yeah it's pretty interesting
[2562.52 → 2565.52] unless there's like some form of disco- I don't know
[2565.52 → 2566.52] this is getting into weird law stuff
[2566.52 → 2568.52] but they should, I guess tell you
[2569.52 → 2571.52] maybe you have to- I don't know that's really weird
[2571.52 → 2572.52] I have no idea
[2572.52 → 2574.52] I don't know how American laws work I'm not going to say anything
[2575.52 → 2583.52] so there are reports online that have claimed that ATN scopes were being used by the Taliban which would obviously be a bit of a problem
[2583.52 → 2588.52] but how could you prove- because couldn't someone just buy it in America and just ship it somewhere?
[2588.52 → 2591.52] it's a scope is it illegal to ship that somewhere? I have no idea maybe it is
[2591.52 → 2600.52] well there are lots of things that are illegal to ship to like it's actually in the end user license agreement that you can't- okay so for example we have a thermal camera
[2600.52 → 2601.52] yeah
[2601.52 → 2608.52] that we had to sign a very long and detailed document saying that it will be in our possession only
[2608.52 → 2612.52] and if it is ever not in our position we need to- in our possession we need to return it
[2613.52 → 2621.52] and that we will not use it in any way to aid, help, abet or whatever terrorist activity or any of these industries or whatever else like-
[2621.52 → 2622.52] Wow
[2622.52 → 2625.52] there is equipment that is tightly regulated like that
[2625.52 → 2628.52] I could see something like weapons scopes
[2628.52 → 2629.52] a scope be part of it? Yeah, that makes sense
[2629.52 → 2635.52] being the kind of thing that comes with a user agreement that says I will not give it to a terrorist to shoot people
[2635.52 → 2641.52] if something is being used somewhere it's hard to say that the company that sells it is at fault
[2641.52 → 2646.52] like what wasn't the-wasn't ISIS driving a whole fleet of Toyota trucks?
[2646.52 → 2648.52] I don't- I don't remember
[2648.52 → 2650.52] like is that Toyota's fault? I don't think so
[2650.52 → 2655.52] I don't know it depends if Toyota set a sales rep over there it would be like hey want a deal?
[2655.52 → 2661.52] want a bunch of trucks? I just- I don't know I- this is way beyond me, but I think it's a little funky
[2661.52 → 2666.52] I'd be like hey some people are using it that means you did illegal things
[2667.52 → 2668.52] oh well
[2669.52 → 2670.52] paying with your hand?
[2670.52 → 2672.52] yeah paying with your hand at Whole Foods
[2672.52 → 2675.52] so Amazon is testing a payment system codename Orville
[2678.52 → 2682.52] that scans- I mean- I mean isn't that just spookily close to Orwell?
[2682.52 → 2683.52] yeah
[2683.52 → 2684.52] like I- is that where you are with it?
[2684.52 → 2686.52] that was a bad idea I did too
[2686.52 → 2689.52] it scans human hands to ring up their purchases
[2689.52 → 2700.52] they're reportedly using their New York employees as guinea pigs by installing the system on a handful of- that's a joke-handful- of vending machines selling chip sodas and phone chargers in their offices
[2700.52 → 2704.52] unlike most biometric systems that require you to touch the surface of a scanner
[2704.52 → 2707.52] Amazon's take on the technology doesn't need you to physically touch anything
[2707.52 → 2714.52] they use computer vision and depth geometry to identify the size and shape of your hand before charging the credit card you have on file
[2714.52 → 2715.52] wow
[2715.52 → 2718.52] furthermore you don't even need to have your phone with you when you shop
[2718.52 → 2723.52] so this could make shopping at Whole Foods even more seamless than at Amazon Go stores
[2723.52 → 2725.52] you need to be a Prime member for hand-based payments to work
[2726.52 → 2727.52] um
[2728.52 → 2734.52] it's possible they decided to give customers the option to pay with their hands instead of their face because it would feel less like a mugshot
[2734.52 → 2737.52] and now they can recommend you the perfect size gloves
[2738.52 → 2745.52] possibly even figure out basic nutritional and health data so they can recommend you different drugs and nutritional supplements
[2745.52 → 2747.52] and what kind of condoms you need
[2747.52 → 2749.52] not that it's proportional
[2751.52 → 2758.52] Amazon is reportedly hoping to roll the technology up to a handful of Whole Foods stores by the beginning of next year with no specific locations in mind
[2758.52 → 2765.52] and they're refining it so they can bump the accuracy up from within one ten thousandth of an inch
[2765.52 → 2770.52] or sorry one ten thousandth of one percent to a millionth of one percent before launch that is incredible
[2770.52 → 2771.52] that's pretty nuts
[2771.52 → 2774.52] alright then that's pretty much it for the WAN show
[2774.52 → 2775.52] yeah
[2775.52 → 2777.52] appreciate you guys tuning in we'll see you again next week
[2777.52 → 2779.52] same bat time same bat channel
[2779.52 → 2780.52] bye
[2780.52 → 2783.52] dang
[2783.52 → 2785.52] oh wait
[2785.52 → 2786.52] super chats
[2786.52 → 2794.52] can James do another laptop replacement style video of the Samsung Tab S6 like he did for the iPad Pro
[2795.52 → 2798.52] did James do that? I thought Riley wrote our iPad Pro video
[2798.52 → 2799.52] either way
[2799.52 → 2801.52] uh we thought about it, we just
[2802.52 → 2804.52] really didn't care
[2805.52 → 2806.52] um
[2806.52 → 2808.52] I don't know how to I don't know how to say that more kindly
[2808.52 → 2810.52] um
[2810.52 → 2812.52] 3-9 says what does this button do?
[2812.52 → 2813.52] it gives us money
[2813.52 → 2814.52] thanks
[2814.52 → 2815.52] uh
[2815.52 → 2816.52] Blaine
[2816.52 → 2820.52] I'll give you twenty dollars more to eat an entire bag of jerky on air
[2820.52 → 2821.52] hold on a second
[2821.52 → 2822.52] you're going to do it?
[2822.52 → 2823.52] well only if there's uh
[2823.52 → 2825.52] that's a lot of jerky dude
[2825.52 → 2827.52] only if there are flavors I really like
[2827.52 → 2828.52] okay
[2828.52 → 2829.52] oh
[2829.52 → 2831.52] there's no jerky on hand
[2831.52 → 2833.52] oh wait is there jerky over there? One moment please
[2833.52 → 2834.52] they didn't sponsor this show
[2834.52 → 2835.52] I know that's fine I don't care
[2835.52 → 2836.52] I know that's fine I don't care
[2838.52 → 2840.52] oh wow there's a lot of jerky here
[2840.52 → 2845.52] if there's maple buffalo bacon I will eat the whole thing in one handful
[2845.52 → 2847.52] have you seen the mu- wow
[2847.52 → 2848.52] yeah I'm doing it
[2848.52 → 2849.52] is that maple-okay
[2849.52 → 2850.52] oh yeah
[2850.52 → 2851.52] oh I'm so excited
[2851.52 → 2852.52] okay so what's up?
[2852.52 → 2853.52] how many-how many-yeah
[2854.52 → 2858.52] how-how- how like what's the nutritional information on an entire bag of jerky?
[2858.52 → 2859.52] um
[2859.52 → 2860.52] here we go
[2860.52 → 2863.52] per serving size-okay servings per container two
[2863.52 → 2867.52] so this will be 16% of my daily total fat
[2867.52 → 2868.52] um
[2868.52 → 2869.52] ten grams
[2869.52 → 2870.52] not as bad as I thought
[2870.52 → 2871.52] uh
[2871.52 → 2873.52] three percent of my daily- or six percent of my cholesterol
[2873.52 → 2876.52] a whopping 70% of my daily sodium intake
[2876.52 → 2877.52] there we go
[2877.52 → 2880.52] ten grams of carbohydrate including uh
[2880.52 → 2883.52] oh that's ten grams of sugars and five grams of protein
[2883.52 → 2884.52] that could be a lot worse
[2884.52 → 2885.52] yeah
[2885.52 → 2887.52] I mean that's sort of the idea behind savage jerky
[2887.52 → 2890.52] not that I have to do their talking points because they didn't sponsor the show today but like
[2890.52 → 2891.52] yep that's true
[2891.52 → 2892.52] yep that's true
[2892.52 → 2893.52] it's not that bad
[2893.52 → 2894.52] yeah
[2894.52 → 2895.52] um
[2895.52 → 2897.52] alright this is going to be a little messy because this one's kinda like oily
[2897.52 → 2899.52] a broken TV
[2899.52 → 2900.52] oh wow
[2900.52 → 2901.52] you're going to do that in one-in one shot
[2901.52 → 2904.52] I am not sure if I had completely thought this through
[2904.52 → 2906.52] that is a lot of bacon
[2906.52 → 2907.52] um
[2907.52 → 2908.52] oh man
[2908.52 → 2909.52] a broken TV says
[2909.52 → 2910.52] can I do one serving?
[2910.52 → 2911.52] there are two servings per bag
[2911.52 → 2913.52] can I just do half of it?
[2913.52 → 2919.52] I think- I think there's like a level of challenge or disgusting and you have to figure out where on that makes the most sense
[2919.52 → 2920.52] he's doing the whole thing
[2920.52 → 2922.52] nope he's doing one serving
[2922.52 → 2924.52] he did
[2924.52 → 2927.52] two thirds of the package I would say
[2927.52 → 2928.52] okay
[2928.52 → 2929.52] that was-
[2929.52 → 2931.52] that was a huge amount
[2931.52 → 2935.52] that was the lion's share of the-of the bacon all at once
[2935.52 → 2937.52] I'm still happy right now
[2937.52 → 2943.52] I'm going to keep doing super chats
[2943.52 → 2947.52] uh a broken TV have you seen the Microsoft musical their interns made?
[2947.52 → 2948.52] no
[2948.52 → 2950.52] that sounds interesting
[2950.52 → 2952.52] uh the usual gaming pc
[2952.52 → 2954.52] uh the one piece-uh the-
[2954.52 → 2956.52] why are large ATX cases still the standard?
[2956.52 → 2961.52] I think in my opinion being able to mess around with things is cool and nice
[2961.52 → 2966.52] and people don't want to have to limit themselves and if they have the space for that tower
[2966.52 → 2970.52] then whatever because the cases don't really cost much more
[2970.52 → 2974.52] the hardware doesn't really cost much more
[2974.52 → 2975.52] if anything
[2975.52 → 2978.52] in a lot of cases possibly cheaper because they're more common
[2978.52 → 2982.52] um also using your old case is a thing that I suspect
[2982.52 → 2984.52] quite a few people actually do
[2984.52 → 2988.52] um especially having gone to quite a few lands now
[2988.52 → 2991.52] it's like wow yeah that's from uh
[2991.52 → 2992.52] that's from the early 2000s
[2992.52 → 2993.52] 2002
[2993.52 → 2994.52] yeah exactly
[2994.52 → 2995.52] and it has modern hardware in it cool
[2995.52 → 2997.52] I am still planning to review the Chevy volt
[2997.52 → 3001.52] um as for the regular like trade-ins and doing car review videos
[3001.52 → 3003.52] obviously I like didn't get around to that
[3003.52 → 3004.52] um
[3004.52 → 3006.52] I still kind of want to do it
[3006.52 → 3008.52] you still do you could do like a car review every year
[3008.52 → 3010.52] that's not a bad approach
[3010.52 → 3013.52] I spent a year with the Chevy volt
[3013.52 → 3014.52] yeah
[3014.52 → 3015.52] these are my thoughts
[3015.52 → 3016.52] I mean I have a lot of thoughts about the volt
[3016.52 → 3019.52] I have basically written out everything I have to say
[3019.52 → 3020.52] and then I was putting it off until the summer
[3020.52 → 3022.52] because I wanted the weather to be good while we shot
[3022.52 → 3024.52] and now the summer's gone
[3025.52 → 3027.52] um so maybe I'll do it next year
[3028.52 → 3030.52] I mean I have such a great title for the video
[3030.52 → 3032.52] that it's going to perform super well regardless of how
[3032.52 → 3035.52] like outdated the volt, and how discontinued it is at that point
[3035.52 → 3036.52] so
[3036.52 → 3037.52] right
[3038.52 → 3040.52] uh why did we start uploading complete videos on Facebook
[3040.52 → 3042.52] um Facebook turned on monetization for us
[3042.52 → 3044.52] so we stopped ignoring them
[3044.52 → 3045.52] cool
[3045.52 → 3046.52] um
[3046.52 → 3048.52] video suggestion
[3048.52 → 3050.52] make a skull trail follow up with the VGA SR2
[3050.52 → 3052.52] I would love to do that
[3052.52 → 3053.52] um
[3053.52 → 3055.52] you know
[3055.52 → 3056.52] isn't that
[3056.52 → 3057.52] kind of old now
[3057.52 → 3059.52] the dual socket board for gamers
[3059.52 → 3060.52] um
[3060.52 → 3061.52] I forget
[3061.52 → 3065.52] I thought the SRX was after the SR2 though
[3067.52 → 3068.52] Cody says I work in Labrador
[3068.52 → 3069.52] Wow
[3069.52 → 3070.52] we have 24 megabytes in town
[3070.52 → 3071.52] and one Meg in the country
[3071.52 → 3072.52] oh, oh megabit I guess
[3073.52 → 3074.52] um no cell service
[3074.52 → 3076.52] hard to watch your videos at 2am when no one's online
[3077.52 → 3078.52] oh had to
[3078.52 → 3079.52] had to
[3079.52 → 3080.52] lol

[3085.52 → 3086.52] because it has everything I need
[3086.52 → 3087.52] we don't have a backpack yet
[3087.52 → 3088.52] yeah what
[3088.52 → 3089.52] speaking of um

[3106.52 → 3107.52] um
[3107.52 → 3111.52] and then the Ram shirt has actually been super popular
[3111.52 → 3112.52] um

[3141.52 → 3143.52] uh we have new colours of water bottles coming

[3145.52 → 3146.52] yeah
[3146.52 → 3147.52] Constellation's still doing really well
[3148.52 → 3149.52] Elemental
[3149.52 → 3150.52] I don't wanna talk about Elemental
[3150.52 → 3152.52] Constellation and CPU are going to be hard to dethrone for me
[3152.52 → 3153.52] you think so?
[3153.52 → 3154.52] yeah
[3154.52 → 3155.52] I really like those
[3155.52 → 3156.52] I actually am partial to hard drive
[3156.52 → 3157.52] hard drive's perfect
[3157.52 → 3158.52] hard drive's really, really good
[3158.52 → 3160.52] I like that for people who aren't into computers
[3160.52 → 3162.52] they're like oh yeah it's like a record
[3162.52 → 3163.52] oh
[3163.52 → 3165.52] and I'm like sure
[3165.52 → 3166.52] yeah why not
[3166.52 → 3167.52] yeah
[3167.52 → 3168.52] it's whatever you want it to be
[3168.52 → 3169.52] yeah
[3169.52 → 3170.52] whatever makes you happy
[3170.52 → 3172.52] that's funny
[3172.52 → 3173.52] um
[3173.52 → 3174.52] hmm
[3174.52 → 3176.52] apple no answer Linus
[3176.52 → 3177.52] karma's a bitch
[3177.52 → 3179.52] alright fair enough
[3179.52 → 3180.52] Tommy again
[3180.52 → 3181.52] me again
[3181.52 → 3183.52] my reminder to you that you promised to bring back Channel Superfine
[3183.52 → 3184.52] okay we're working on it
[3184.52 → 3185.52] yeah
[3185.52 → 3186.52] you didn't say when
[3186.52 → 3187.52] it could be like 2030
[3187.52 → 3188.52] I did say when
[3188.52 → 3189.52] did you?
[3189.52 → 3190.52] yeah I said sometime in the next couple of months
[3190.52 → 3191.52] oh
[3191.52 → 3192.52] so we booked a shoot date
[3192.52 → 3193.52] today
[3193.52 → 3195.52] no we didn't book it like for today
[3195.52 → 3197.52] but we booked it today for later
[3197.52 → 3198.52] hmm
[3200.52 → 3201.52] we're both beautiful
[3203.52 → 3205.52] uh plantation says read his emails
[3205.52 → 3206.52] no, no he didn't read my emails
[3206.52 → 3207.52] because he's a good person
[3207.52 → 3208.52] oh get rest
[3208.52 → 3209.52] um
[3209.52 → 3212.52] Christian says Luke I expect my purple Sharpe back next year at LTX 2020
[3212.52 → 3213.52] I think I have it
[3214.52 → 3215.52] so maybe
[3216.52 → 3222.52] Yuma says something ninja says here's my Google opinion rewards money
[3222.52 → 3223.52] maybe this helps
[3223.52 → 3225.52] what is Google opinion rewards?
[3225.52 → 3226.52] I think it's like um
[3226.52 → 3229.52] when you like rate stores and stuff
[3229.52 → 3230.52] really?
[3230.52 → 3231.52] yeah
[3231.52 → 3232.52] do you get money for that?
[3232.52 → 3234.52] I think you have to sign up for the program
[3234.52 → 3236.52] and then I think if you do enough of it
[3236.52 → 3237.52] you probably get something
[3237.52 → 3239.52] so that's probably like all he's ever made on it
[3239.52 → 3240.52] huh
[3240.52 → 3241.52] that's my assumption
[3241.52 → 3242.52] I really don't know
[3242.52 → 3243.52] and it probably
[3243.52 → 3245.52] it probably only gives you money within the Google ecosystem
[3245.52 → 3248.52] Jerry says YouTube bad float plane good
[3248.52 → 3249.52] yeah
[3249.52 → 3251.52] still using my PC
[3251.52 → 3253.52] you helped me build in 2015
[3253.52 → 3255.52] with a 6600K and 964 gig
[3255.52 → 3256.52] keep doing what you do
[3256.52 → 3257.52] nice
[3257.52 → 3258.52] sweet
[3260.52 → 3261.52] I would call Carly
[3261.52 → 3262.52] you guys are friends with her
[3262.52 → 3263.52] it might be your best bet
[3263.52 → 3264.52] I think you mean Justine
[3264.52 → 3265.52] yeah
[3265.52 → 3266.52] Carly
[3266.52 → 3267.52] that's a good one
[3267.52 → 3269.52] I think Carly's like a Disney Channel thing
[3270.52 → 3271.52] I could
[3271.52 → 3272.52] um
[3272.52 → 3273.52] so a little bit of inside baseball for you guys
[3274.52 → 3277.52] it's actually considered
[3277.52 → 3278.52] and this is like
[3278.52 → 3279.52] unspoken
[3279.52 → 3281.52] but it's considered
[3281.52 → 3282.52] um
[3282.52 → 3283.52] bad manners
[3283.52 → 3288.52] to reach out to other members of the media
[3288.52 → 3290.52] and ask for hookups
[3290.52 → 3293.52] unless you have exhausted all other options
[3293.52 → 3295.52] and as far as I'm concerned
[3295.52 → 3297.52] by the time I have reached out to Apple media support
[3297.52 → 3300.52] and said hey I'd love to start a conversation
[3300.52 → 3302.52] and they have
[3302.52 → 3303.52] clearly opted
[3303.52 → 3305.52] not to follow that up with me
[3305.52 → 3307.52] I have basically
[3307.52 → 3308.52] um
[3308.52 → 3309.52] I have got an answer
[3309.52 → 3310.52] even if it was an answer
[3310.52 → 3311.52] that I didn't like
[3311.52 → 3312.52] yeah
[3312.52 → 3313.52] and so to put someone else
[3313.52 → 3314.52] like Justine
[3314.52 → 3315.52] um
[3315.52 → 3316.52] or you know
[3316.52 → 3318.52] Jonathan Morrison or Austin or whoever
[3318.52 → 3319.52] into a potentially bad situation
[3319.52 → 3321.52] yeah to put one of them in a position
[3321.52 → 3322.52] where
[3322.52 → 3325.52] they have to put their neck on the line
[3325.52 → 3327.52] for
[3327.52 → 3328.52] to ask someone else
[3328.52 → 3329.52] to put their neck on the line
[3329.52 → 3332.52] to overturn a decision that has clearly already been made
[3333.52 → 3334.52] it's like
[3334.52 → 3335.52] it's not unheard of
[3335.52 → 3337.52] it's something I have done
[3337.52 → 3338.52] but it's like
[3338.52 → 3339.52] a pretty
[3339.52 → 3342.52] it's a bigger favour than you guys might necessarily think
[3342.52 → 3343.52] Yeah
[3343.52 → 3346.52] because there's a finite number of seats at these events
[3346.52 → 3348.52] there's a finite number of review samples
[3348.52 → 3350.52] and there's a finite amount of time
[3350.52 → 3352.52] and company reps
[3352.52 → 3353.52] they have to manage
[3353.52 → 3354.52] all of those things
[3354.52 → 3356.52] and so for every
[3356.52 → 3358.52] for every exception
[3358.52 → 3359.52] that gets made
[3359.52 → 3361.52] someone gets kicked out of a seat
[3361.52 → 3363.52] off a review sample list
[3363.52 → 3364.52] or
[3364.52 → 3366.52] out of getting a reply in the inbox
[3366.52 → 3368.52] if that kind of makes sense to you guys
[3368.52 → 3370.52] so we try to be
[3370.52 → 3372.52] we try to be diplomatic
[3372.52 → 3374.52] about the way that we engage with companies
[3374.52 → 3376.52] if they want to engage with us that's great
[3376.52 → 3377.52] and if they don't then
[3377.52 → 3379.52] as far as we're concerned
[3379.52 → 3381.52] you know I'll reach out once every three years or so
[3381.52 → 3382.52] and be like
[3382.52 → 3383.52] hey
[3383.52 → 3384.52] has the Yahoo
[3384.52 → 3387.52] who decided they think we're not worth talking to
[3387.52 → 3388.52] quit
[3388.52 → 3389.52] or been fired yet?
[3389.52 → 3390.52] no? Okay
[3390.52 → 3391.52] then I guess we'll wait
[3391.52 → 3393.52] That's a good way of putting it
[3393.52 → 3394.52] I like that
[3394.52 → 3395.52] Aertex says
[3395.52 → 3398.52] have you guys ever considered an unread build config guide?
[3398.52 → 3401.52] I think you guys could do better than the other guys on YouTube
[3401.52 → 3404.52] no actually I hadn't thought of doing that lately
[3404.52 → 3405.52] it's just it's kind of dry
[3405.52 → 3407.52] yeah
[3411.52 → 3412.52] Trent says
[3412.52 → 3413.52] school
[3413.52 → 3414.52] Apple sucks
[3414.52 → 3415.52] I tried to purchase iPads for a school I work for
[3415.52 → 3417.52] and couldn't get anyone at Apple to give me a quote
[3417.52 → 3420.52] but this says schools only can buy from Apple
[3420.52 → 3421.52] I don't really understand
[3421.52 → 3422.52] what?
[3422.52 → 3423.52] that message
[3423.52 → 3424.52] thanks Everett
[3424.52 → 3426.52] thanks Kyle
[3426.52 → 3427.52] yes we're hiring
[3427.52 → 3428.52] just go to our website
[3428.52 → 3429.52] if you can't figure out
[3429.52 → 3431.52] where the positions are listed on our website
[3431.52 → 3433.52] then you're probably not the right candidate
[3436.52 → 3437.52] alright
[3437.52 → 3438.52] milk your fish
[3438.52 → 3439.52] last question
[3439.52 → 3442.52] why does LTT store charge in USD instead of CAD?
[3442.52 → 3444.52] because most of our viewers are US
[3444.52 → 3446.52] and also the USD is worth more
[3446.52 → 3449.52] I think it's more consistent and just
[3449.52 → 3450.52] people internationally understand it better
[3450.52 → 3452.52] it's a standard internationally
[3452.52 → 3453.52] it makes a lot more sense
[3453.52 → 3456.52] everyone knows their own currency in USD
[3456.52 → 3459.52] because so much of product pricing
[3459.52 → 3461.52] be it games or computer hardware or whatever
[3461.52 → 3463.52] is at least initially based on that
[3463.52 → 3464.52] is based on USD and then converted
[3464.52 → 3466.52] although that's become less true over the last like
[3466.52 → 3467.52] five to ten years
[3467.52 → 3472.52] like it used to be that European pricing was sort of based on USD pricing
[3472.52 → 3474.52] now it's based on it, but it's just like one to one
[3474.52 → 3476.52] because I don't know
[3476.52 → 3479.52] F anyone who pays in pounds or the euro
[3479.52 → 3480.52] yeah
[3480.52 → 3481.52] alright guff
[3481.52 → 3482.52] kinda brutal
[3486.52 → 3487.52] alright
[3487.52 → 3488.52] oh 32 bytes says you get money
[3488.52 → 3491.52] to use on the Google Play Store for taking surveys
[3493.52 → 3494.52] mostly if you've been to a local store
[3494.52 → 3495.52] you get about 10 to 20 cents each
[3495.52 → 3496.52] that's not bad
[3496.52 → 3498.52] that's surprisingly not bad
[3498.52 → 3499.52] I've got a hundred bucks
[3499.52 → 3500.52] wow
[3500.52 → 3502.52] if you're playing classic WoW
[3502.52 → 3504.52] join Fairbanks Horde
[3504.52 → 3505.52] join the guild
[3505.52 → 3506.52] come hang out
[3506.52 → 3507.52] alright
