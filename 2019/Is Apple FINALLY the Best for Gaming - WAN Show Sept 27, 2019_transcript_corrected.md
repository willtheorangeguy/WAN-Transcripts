[0.00 → 3.06] I think you're supposed to tweet, too.
[3.46 → 4.56] Oh, really?
[6.28 → 9.46] Jake, why would you tell me to go live if you knew that we needed to tweet?
[9.46 → 9.70] Oh, you went live.
[10.06 → 11.16] Welcome to the WAN Show, guys.
[11.20 → 16.06] You get to hang out for an hour with James and Anthony, also known as Antonyms.
[17.06 → 17.76] I can tweet for you.
[17.86 → 18.18] Anthony?
[18.70 → 19.36] I'll tweet for you.
[19.92 → 20.28] Antonyms.
[20.84 → 21.20] Antonyms?
[21.48 → 23.00] I mean, that is a name, I guess.
[23.28 → 25.44] It's the first time this combination has happened.
[25.56 → 29.38] I feel like it's a no compromises solution here.
[29.38 → 30.44] No compromises.
[30.62 → 33.64] If you love Anthony but hate James, you still get Anthony.
[34.04 → 36.38] If you like James for some reason, he's here, too.
[37.38 → 38.50] We've got a great show for you guys tonight.
[38.58 → 46.16] We're going to cover all sorts of crazy stuff, including a comparison of the Google Play Pass and Apple Arcade.
[46.72 → 48.00] Yeah, and that should be pretty good.
[48.10 → 52.96] We've also got the Amazon Hardware event and the Checkmate iPhone exploit.
[53.78 → 55.84] This Apple Arcade thing is actually more interesting than I thought.
[55.92 → 56.38] Roll the intro.
[56.84 → 57.58] Let's get into it.
[59.38 → 61.22] Win, win, winning, win, win, win, win.
[61.76 → 62.30] Better, win, win, win, win, win.
[62.30 → 63.34] Nuthatch.
[70.36 → 74.68] Ready, ready, ready.
[80.72 → 82.76] Almost done.
[82.76 → 86.92] that Vertigoes I'm in your chair
[86.92 → 90.34] it's a turkey
[90.34 → 97.98] display cool oh my god we're terrible I
[97.98 → 100.20] think this is going to be a good day it's
[100.20 → 102.38] going to be a good weekend it's a Friday
[102.38 → 105.26] aren't we doing an actual video on this
[105.26 → 109.12] Google Pay plot hey play pass versus
[109.12 → 110.84] Apple Arcade yeah I think, so I think
[110.84 → 115.02] isn't Nicholas on that or was it Jake not
[115.02 → 116.42] sure if it was Jake or Nicholas I don't
[116.42 → 118.76] know, but I'm actually surprised at how
[118.76 → 122.08] cool this topic is, so I believe that the
[122.08 → 124.32] Apple Arcade subscription came out first
[124.32 → 125.54] and that's something that was announced
[125.54 → 129.10] hey you guys be quiet over there it's
[129.10 → 130.52] something that was announced at the Apple
[130.52 → 133.22] keynote along with the iPhone 11 yep and
[133.22 → 135.90] that one seems simpler it's basically
[135.90 → 137.78] just you pay five bucks a month and you
[137.78 → 141.28] get games basically yeah but Google's
[141.28 → 143.00] answer to that which they must have had
[143.00 → 145.54] in development way before it do I don't
[145.54 → 147.32] think it's like oh yeah Apple hold my
[147.32 → 148.84] beer it's like they obviously something
[148.84 → 150.00] like this they've had in the works for a
[150.00 → 152.12] while anyway their answer isn't just
[152.12 → 154.46] games it's a lot of games, but it's also
[154.46 → 158.42] apps okay like I hadn't been keeping up on
[158.42 → 160.46] this because I'm a filthy iOS user for
[160.46 → 162.74] some reason that's so weird to me yeah
[162.74 → 165.54] it's weird to a lot of people but like I've
[165.54 → 167.88] got this MacBook Pro I hacked it to have
[167.88 → 170.34] like continuity and yeah it just works
[170.34 → 175.62] Google Play Pass is a paid subscription
[175.62 → 177.04] service for Google Play that allows
[177.04 → 179.64] access to around 350 apps and games
[179.64 → 183.24] removing ads as well as the upfront and
[183.24 → 186.30] in-app price of the game so if an app is
[186.30 → 188.08] normally two dollars to buy it that
[188.08 → 190.50] price will be gone or if there's freemium
[190.50 → 193.56] stuff inside that would be included as
[193.56 → 195.90] well so how do they handle stuff like oh
[195.90 → 198.66] you need this much this many gems to
[198.66 → 200.88] continue I don't just like I don't know I
[200.88 → 202.80] think it just it's like you're out of
[202.80 → 205.38] energy do you just like charge
[205.38 → 207.90] it to your Google Play what was the uh
[207.90 → 210.18] what was the code that you typed in
[210.18 → 213.66] Star craft for more money oh not black
[213.66 → 218.76] sheet wall not power overwhelming someone
[218.76 → 223.50] knows this chat it's going to be so obvious
[223.50 → 226.08] anyway they have cut up, yet I don't think
[226.08 → 228.90] so it's gonna start with about 350 apps
[228.90 → 230.76] and games, but they say they're going to add
[230.76 → 234.36] more stuff every month with titles
[234.36 → 236.94] like this war of mine and sites coming
[236.94 → 239.70] soon, and I think when you're going
[239.70 → 241.14] through the Play Store if one of the
[241.14 → 243.54] apps or games that you see on the Play Store
[243.54 → 246.90] is within the purview of the subscription
[246.90 → 248.52] it's going to have a special logo on it they
[248.52 → 251.16] made like a Google material design
[251.16 → 253.26] stylized ticket logo looks like an
[253.26 → 255.38] admin one kind of ticket this maybe this
[255.38 → 260.64] Android police link let's see here they
[260.64 → 263.52] have any yeah there it is I think that's a
[263.52 → 268.32] nice little logo yeah yeah it's
[268.32 → 271.50] kind of cute play class is pick play pass
[271.50 → 274.20] it's so hard to say play pass because I
[274.20 → 276.12] want to say Google Pay pay yeah yeah
[276.12 → 278.46] pay class is coming to the US this week
[278.46 → 280.74] at a price of $4.99 a month with
[280.74 → 282.72] available availability extending to more
[282.72 → 284.40] countries soon, and you can do a 10-day
[284.40 → 286.08] trial of course and what's cool is it
[286.08 → 288.00] works kind of like the family plan on
[288.00 → 290.64] Google Play Music where it's a family
[290.64 → 292.38] pass so if you pay the five bucks a month
[292.38 → 295.32] for the Play Pass ticket you get
[295.32 → 297.18] you can give that up to five different
[297.18 → 299.52] family members, and it's its totally
[299.52 → 301.08] exclusive or like they're mutually
[301.08 → 303.12] exclusive so if you download a certain
[303.12 → 305.70] game it doesn't affect me everyone's
[305.70 → 308.34] kind of like segregated in that way okay
[308.34 → 311.30] so is it unlimited like the Apple games
[311.30 → 313.44] passes Apple Arcade what do you mean
[313.44 → 316.56] like I think actually let me just
[316.56 → 318.78] quickly pull this up because it's here in
[318.78 → 323.16] my App Store Arcade yeah so all you can
[323.16 → 325.44] play free for one month oh so they give
[325.44 → 327.78] you a one-month retrial on iOS yeah
[327.78 → 329.94] whereas they give you 10 days on Android
[329.94 → 333.24] mm-hmm but iOS looks like it's just
[333.24 → 335.22] games whereas again you said Android was
[335.22 → 338.52] games and apps that's right hmm but
[338.52 → 340.78] there's something that's actually super
[340.78 → 345.12] interesting though the thing with the
[345.12 → 346.38] Apple Arcade it has all these
[346.38 → 348.18] constraints that kind of change the
[348.18 → 350.58] whole nature of the thing so on Apple
[350.58 → 352.78] Arcade it's all games no apps the games
[352.78 → 355.12] the games are exclusive to Apple's mobile
[355.12 → 357.58] platform, so there can be games on there
[357.58 → 360.16] that maybe also are on switch or on Xbox
[360.16 → 362.68] but none of the games on Apple Arcade will
[362.68 → 366.04] be on Android okay, okay in addition to that
[366.04 → 369.70] once the games are available if the
[369.70 → 372.58] games in arcade it's not available on it
[372.58 → 375.88] iOS not an arcade oh you can't just go to
[375.88 → 378.28] the App Store and get these games and play like
[378.28 → 380.12] the paid version which is how it works on
[380.12 → 382.52] Android if I don't have the play pass I can
[382.52 → 384.92] still pay two bucks for the game or play
[384.92 → 386.90] the free version of the game and then buy
[386.90 → 389.96] all the free-to-play or pay-to-win stuff
[389.96 → 392.12] that's in the game right and so this kind
[392.12 → 394.18] of changes everything because when you're
[394.18 → 397.40] using Apple Arcade you're playing games that
[397.40 → 399.02] have a completely different design
[399.02 → 401.48] structure to them yeah so like when you
[401.48 → 403.70] consider most mobile games like they have
[403.70 → 408.56] like gems or some kind of premium currency how
[408.56 → 410.90] do you convert that to like a
[410.90 → 413.36] freemium like a play out like an all-you-can-eat
[413.36 → 416.36] pass like I don't exactly know how Google is
[416.36 → 419.06] doing that but what I'm saying is like they
[419.06 → 421.40] don't have to even cross that bridge on the
[421.40 → 423.74] Apple Arcade right the game doesn't have these
[423.74 → 426.26] built-in mechanics to keep you playing and
[426.26 → 428.86] stuff it can be it could be like games used to
[428.86 → 430.94] be when they thought you just paid you paid
[430.94 → 433.22] for the ticket, and now you can take the ride and
[433.22 → 435.56] the ride can be all myriad things the ride
[435.56 → 437.56] doesn't have to be designed to give you these
[437.56 → 441.74] dopamine hooks at like very specific intervals to
[441.74 → 443.06] keep you playing for another five hours and
[443.06 → 446.86] putting more coins in the machine yeah so
[446.86 → 449.80] that's why we made the title of this episode what
[449.80 → 452.64] we did because it's kind of like those are kind
[452.64 → 456.30] of the games I want to play yeah like if they
[456.30 → 458.86] can make like a story-driven RPG or something that
[458.86 → 461.06] you know doesn't require any microtransactions
[461.06 → 463.94] that sounds great to me like that's the kind of
[463.94 → 467.50] thing that's very rare on a mobile device but
[467.50 → 470.98] how like I don't see how that that can translate
[470.98 → 472.80] over to Google Play unless they make like
[472.80 → 476.42] $20 games that you can purchase on the Play Store
[476.42 → 479.38] yeah and the other side of it is that if there's
[479.38 → 483.20] like really, really huge games that are on iOS and
[483.20 → 485.78] Android those games are not going to be on
[485.78 → 488.54] Apple Arcade because they're not going to those
[488.54 → 490.48] games aren't going to the opportunity cost of
[490.48 → 492.26] missing out on all this revenue from the
[492.26 → 493.94] different platforms isn't going to be worth it
[493.94 → 496.56] for those games to just be exclusive to Apple
[496.56 → 499.92] Arcade or well I mean that really depends on
[499.92 → 501.70] what you define as worth it because Apple
[501.70 → 503.54] probably has quite a bit of cash to throw at
[503.54 → 506.26] people to do that yeah that's one thing we
[506.26 → 508.18] don't know is how they're being compensated so
[508.18 → 511.52] we had some there are some notes here about how
[511.52 → 513.80] Google was going to compensate developers
[513.80 → 516.12] initially they plan to pay developers based on a
[516.12 → 519.18] formula that focused on how much time the games
[519.18 → 522.24] were being played, but that's problematic as it
[522.24 → 524.64] encourages the creation of games that require
[524.64 → 526.98] players to grind forever in order to boost
[526.98 → 529.00] developer payouts right like if I'm getting paid
[529.00 → 531.38] per time you spend in my game I'm not going to
[531.38 → 533.44] have I'm going to have a game that is just
[533.44 → 536.82] tedious or like a long bloated game yeah it's
[536.82 → 539.36] like a dark incentive what happens with idle
[539.36 → 542.34] games where like you have a timer going in the
[542.34 → 545.06] game, and then you like come along and get a
[545.06 → 547.96] bunch of stuff later like does that count as
[547.96 → 550.70] playtime if it's idle time what do you mean by
[550.70 → 552.72] idle time like have you ever played okay so
[552.72 → 556.08] there's these games on mobile and also
[556.08 → 559.02] on like web browsers and stuff basically what
[559.02 → 564.26] they do is while idle like a score will start
[564.26 → 566.80] counting up, and then you can come back into the
[566.80 → 568.80] game make some decisions and then leave it for
[568.80 → 571.16] a while, and then you can come back and make some
[571.16 → 573.36] more decisions that kind of thing like time ticks on
[573.36 → 575.32] yeah I don't want time to tick on yeah if I'm
[575.32 → 578.26] playing harvest moon 64, and I want winter
[578.26 → 580.12] to be over or something like that I kind of like that I
[580.12 → 583.02] leave it on I'm not quite the same but yeah yeah
[583.02 → 585.38] sorry it's been a long time it's been a long time for me, I'm
[585.38 → 587.60] going I'm referencing harvest moon 64.
[587.60 → 590.24] well have you ever played the original harvest moon on
[590.24 → 594.36] SNES yeah no I don't think, so I prefer it to be honest really yeah I
[594.36 → 599.24] don't know why, but it's basically the same game so in response to the
[599.24 → 604.36] developer outcry Google's FAQ now reads developers earn a royalty that is
[604.36 → 609.10] based on algorithmic methods that incorporate signals which capture how
[609.10 → 613.84] users value all types of content from weather apps to narrative driven indie
[613.84 → 621.60] games that sound hard to build how are they planning to do that I'll
[621.60 → 626.64] grow the methods Anthony that we're going to incorporate signals like the same way
[626.64 → 632.00] that like did you see the tweet that I made earlier I typed in iPhone 11 Pro on
[632.00 → 636.56] YouTube oh that's what that was yeah, and it was like oh hey you might you
[636.56 → 643.96] must be looking for the related content the last of us 2 like this is the
[643.96 → 648.32] algorithm they're going to come on it did you well it'll be its own algorithm
[648.32 → 652.58] obviously but will I mean the same people well yeah, but it's counterintuitive
[652.58 → 658.44] because no that video does not seem to be like a super related thing but that
[658.44 → 662.90] doesn't mean that it doesn't keep people on the platform which is their main goal
[662.90 → 667.90] right they want to just maximize watch time yeah I guess so like maybe people
[667.90 → 673.98] who like the iPhone 11 Pro are like really big into the last of us but were
[673.98 → 678.32] you in an incognito browser or were you just on like the art it was on my
[678.32 → 682.14] browser so like it might have been, but it's specifically you yeah well do you
[682.14 → 686.92] like the last of us never looked it up at least not on these computers you
[686.92 → 692.74] probably love it probably I just don't know, yet I actually haven't played it I
[692.74 → 697.66] don't know why I think David loves that game should we cover this Amazon hardware
[697.66 → 701.66] now yeah I guess, so I don't know what this is all about this is the first I've
[701.66 → 707.78] heard of it yeah, so Amazon had at their headquarters in Seattle they had a big
[707.78 → 712.88] hardware event where in pure Amazon fashion they announced like 17 new
[712.88 → 717.46] products many of which are just like random, and you'll probably never get so
[717.46 → 721.18] they did that, but there are some interesting things in here they're doing
[721.18 → 728.20] earbuds the echo buds which somehow incorporate Bose actor and active noise
[728.20 → 738.26] cancelling oh god there are so many ads so most of these devices if there's a
[738.26 → 742.82] theme it's well it's more echo devices for the home and like iterating on the
[742.82 → 748.34] devices they already had, but the other theme is taking Alexa I think I guess I
[748.34 → 754.98] shouldn't say that sorry everybody never mind taking the assistant out of the
[754.98 → 759.08] home and on the go with you so that's the idea with the buds, and it's also the
[759.08 → 764.26] idea with two kind of more novel devices which are kind of interesting a pair of
[764.26 → 769.54] glasses which are prescription compatible, and they don't have a camera on them
[769.54 → 773.68] they don't have a screen on them or any AR stuff they just have Alexa built in
[773.68 → 784.06] dang it I did it again what yeah echo frames what so they have Alexa built in
[784.06 → 786.82] like what are you supposed to do with that is it paired to your phone or
[786.82 → 792.22] something I don't think the don't know if the frames are paired to your phone but I
[792.22 → 796.42] know that the loop is paired to your phone the loop is the echo loop is a
[796.42 → 802.78] ring, and admittedly it still looks pretty not normal like if I saw someone
[802.78 → 806.08] pretty chunky if I saw someone wearing that I would know something was going on
[806.08 → 814.12] I can't see that yeah the ring the loop echo loop for a hundred bucks is an Alexa
[814.12 → 818.92] enabled smart ring featuring two tiny microphones and a button for activate
[818.92 → 822.20] activating the device it pairs with your phone, and it will vibrate to let
[822.20 → 826.28] you know when the assistant is listening as well as when you're
[826.28 → 831.08] receiving a notification or a call you can actually program one single contact
[831.08 → 835.88] onto the device and call that one contact, but apparently you have to like talk
[835.88 → 841.76] into it and I put it your ear listen, but that's a little weird but that kind of
[841.76 → 851.60] makes sense like except it's $100 it kind of is $100 but wait well it kind of is well they have this like day one feature
[851.60 → 855.80] on their website it's part of it's part of Amazon where they have this kind of
[855.80 → 862.10] startup the kind of beta devices where they're only making a limited number of
[862.10 → 866.48] these things and you kind of have to get invited like given the option to buy it and
[866.48 → 869.54] then you can give them their hundred dollars you know be its kind of like a big
[869.54 → 872.90] beta program and then if the device is successful, and they take your feedback
[872.90 → 881.30] then they'll double down and make a bunch of these things as they do yeah because
[881.30 → 886.46] like smartwatches exist mm-hmm this seems like a big problem for them because
[886.46 → 891.44] this is big like that ring like that looks like it goes between two
[891.44 → 897.68] knuckles like it is huge yeah you're like your hand would not be flat on a table yeah
[897.68 → 902.96] like that would be very inconvenient to wear in my opinion I don't I don't know why they
[902.96 → 908.40] thought it was a good idea like maybe it'd be good for kids, but then kids would never
[908.40 → 913.82] get it on their fingers so it do I think they do offer a few different sizes of it but
[913.82 → 919.40] uh I don't know like I don't use echo I don't I'm not in that ecosystem I use the Google
[919.40 → 925.30] assistant yeah if there were a Google Assistant ring I don't think I would care to wear it I
[925.30 → 932.26] don't think it does enough for me yet but that said I am super stoked that Amazon does do this
[932.26 → 938.30] I'm stoked that they push out these like semi-useless products I'm stoked that they make these like weird
[938.30 → 942.76] products like a microwave and everything and that they just kind of shard out so many different
[942.76 → 948.04] things that maybe aren't the most polished, but I'm thankful because what it does is force the
[948.04 → 953.86] competition forward because now Google like if this is going to be um getting any traction at all
[953.86 → 958.34] then maybe Google thinks oh dang it's time for us to make our glasses, or it's time for us to make
[958.34 → 961.60] our ring and then Apple thinks it's time for us to make our glasses and it kind of just makes
[961.60 → 968.84] everybody compete a little more and then uh we eventually may get them to the goal where maybe I can
[968.84 → 975.16] get a pair of uh Pixel Buds that don't pair to my phone that have the Google Assistant and the
[975.16 → 980.70] assistant is advanced enough that I don't even need my phone like when smartphones came out and still
[980.70 → 985.48] to this day there are so many things that you can't do with them compared to a PC the screen is super
[985.48 → 993.18] small it's super inconvenient to use my smartphone screen to do a lot of tasks, but it's good enough
[993.18 → 998.60] to do tons of other tasks and if the assistant gets better if the assistant gets to the point where
[998.60 → 1002.84] it can like oh you just got a new email from so-and-so do you want me to read it sure what's it say
[1002.84 → 1007.92] blah blah blah, and then I can reply to it and I can do all sorts of things like that if I can get even
[1007.92 → 1013.10] like 60 percent of the things I could do with my phone just done with the assistant then that's
[1013.10 → 1018.10] that is truly disruptive you can be in a developing country where you don't have a thousand dollars
[1018.10 → 1023.30] for a new smartphone, but you might be able to get together 40 or 60 for these kinds of headphones
[1023.30 → 1029.84] and suddenly that's like a whole new game changer I see Amazon's uh products like this as like
[1029.84 → 1035.44] precursors to this kind of devices okay so like it's kind of like almost like an alpha really or
[1035.44 → 1042.04] pre-alpha because they're they're gauging interest and to me that makes that angle makes sense
[1042.04 → 1048.72] because when I think about it, it wasn't that long ago that smartphones required a tether to your
[1048.72 → 1053.96] computer like you had to like sync your contacts to your computer you had to sync your music your
[1053.96 → 1060.62] photos you couldn't actually like fully use your smartphone without your computer and even iPhones
[1060.62 → 1066.50] when they first launched needed iTunes yeah everything yeah iTunes required iTunes like iPods
[1066.50 → 1076.48] iPods and iPhones required iTunes uh up until I think was it the 4 or 4s maybe it was the 5 was it that long
[1076.48 → 1081.98] well they went I think the first intermediary step was that iTunes came out for Windows
[1081.98 → 1088.88] yeah, and then you could use your iPod with Windows um because previously it was a FireWire Mac device
[1088.88 → 1096.60] uh which I think you can also use on Windows to this day if you have a FireWire card which is actually
[1096.60 → 1102.22] kind of cool but yeah like it used to be that you did not have an independent device other than your
[1102.22 → 1109.08] computer your computer was like the hub that everything plugged into, but the more devices like this become
[1109.08 → 1115.92] independent yeah the broader the accessibility becomes for everybody you know in not even not
[1115.92 → 1120.42] even just in the first world but like the Third World as well, well I think it's weird though is
[1120.42 → 1127.30] it's to me, I don't have a lot of appeal for the Echo devices because and I mean I don't use it, and I'm sure
[1127.30 → 1132.12] this is a narrow view of it but to me, it seems like it's shopping focused yeah like they're like
[1132.12 → 1138.66] Google's goal is to deliver their main product Google to you and that's answering questions like helping you
[1138.66 → 1144.54] query and sort information whereas Amazon's goal is to sell you stuff so like I'm not that interested
[1144.54 → 1150.28] in this ring that helps me order new toilet paper when I'm out and about oh you don't want one of
[1150.28 → 1155.52] this Amazon what were they called the buttons the dash button yeah the dash the Amazon dash
[1155.52 → 1158.66] I don't know it was such a great April Fool's joke
[1158.66 → 1168.58] I don't know I don't know I I know maybe it's just because I came to Canada later I have a couple
[1168.58 → 1177.02] friends that have echoes but yeah the Google ecosystem is more um let's say robust at this point
[1177.02 → 1184.18] IMO Amazon does push it forward in other areas earlier than Google though like they acquired ring
[1184.18 → 1190.66] before was it before that Google got nest it's certainly before I think it was before it may
[1190.66 → 1194.14] not have been before they actually acquired nest, but it was they were doing stuff with the ring
[1194.14 → 1198.60] before Google was doing anything with nest but because it was only in the last hardware event that
[1198.60 → 1203.82] they unveiled all those integrated like nest and assistant in one box kind of things
[1203.82 → 1209.86] and it seems like they're heavily subsidizing that stuff too which is helping I think for adoption
[1209.86 → 1214.92] well there's no way like anyone else would sell these like the ring for a hundred dollars
[1214.92 → 1220.16] oh that's not I wonder how much technology is actually in that little ring I know well
[1220.16 → 1226.48] there's speakers and microphones and haptics and a button and Bluetooth obviously
[1226.48 → 1229.48] haptics is tough to get in that small form factor
[1229.48 → 1240.56] did you hear about this uh checkmate oh yeah it reminds me of uh well actually reminded Jake first
[1240.56 → 1247.08] but it also reminds me of that uh the green poison exploit back uh during the was back in like the
[1247.08 → 1257.62] 2010s sometime like 2010 2011 somewhere around there what was um an unwatchable jailbreak that uh
[1257.62 → 1266.78] yeah took advantage of some flaws and that's exactly what's happening here uh from the iPhone 4s to
[1266.78 → 1272.36] the iPhone 10 all devices are impacted that's everything from the think the a5 processor up
[1272.36 → 1280.42] through the a12 or a11 a11 a11 yeah, so basically that could mean that jailbreaking is back
[1280.42 → 1286.10] but it's a big if right now this isn't this is an exploit right it's an exploit, and we don't know if
[1286.10 → 1293.80] this exploit is going to develop into actual jailbreaks that's true it all depends on what the exploit is
[1293.80 → 1301.74] capable of doing if the exploit can actually enable unsigned code to execute then all bets are off
[1301.74 → 1309.78] that is absolutely 100 the case um that's how the Nintendo Switch got hacked that's how the Sony PSV
[1309.78 → 1316.38] got hacked PSP got hacked they found a way to run unsigned code, and they ran it
[1316.38 → 1324.20] the PS3 got hacked differently, but that's well I mean it kind of both ways so backing up a bit
[1324.20 → 1329.72] here a newly announced iOS exploit could lead to a permanent unlockable jailbreak on hundreds of
[1329.72 → 1335.74] millions of iPhones according to researcher Axiom X who discovered it so most generations of iPhones and
[1335.74 → 1342.18] iPads are vulnerable to the iPhone 4s on an a5 chip to iPhone 8 and iPhone 10 on the a11 chip
[1342.18 → 1349.68] the Apple patched the flaw in last year's a12 processors though meaning that iPhone 10s 10r and
[1349.68 → 1355.12] the 11 and 11 pros from this year will not be affected so this exploit is called checkmate
[1355.12 → 1362.24] with an 8 in the name, and it's its a boot room vulnerability which gives hackers deep access to
[1362.24 → 1369.50] two iOS devices because this is the code that runs when you boot up it's the first code that runs you
[1369.50 → 1378.62] can't you can't change this you can't patch this with a firmware update yeah so if you can gain
[1378.62 → 1385.48] access to the boot room at a low level no matter what that boot room is then yeah you have control of
[1385.48 → 1390.98] the system, but they have to you have to do this with a hard line plug-in right like you have to
[1390.98 → 1398.02] have a USB plug-in yeah probably um there may be an alternative I don't know exactly I don't think
[1398.02 → 1402.54] they say yeah it's a tethered exploit for now meaning that it can only be triggered over USB
[1402.54 → 1408.76] which means that each time you restart your device you'll have to re-trigger the jailbreak
[1408.76 → 1416.64] oh really yeah that's that's what a tethered jailbreak means um it was kind of a bummer back
[1416.64 → 1422.70] when I was like jailbreaking iPhones and uh I think it's a big reason why people stopped doing it
[1422.70 → 1426.90] that and the fact that like Apple has actually been adding more and more of that jailbroken
[1426.90 → 1434.20] um functionality that people have come to expect from well their jailbreaks but
[1434.20 → 1438.44] like I think it got to the point didn't the city of store shut down I thought it did
[1438.44 → 1440.12] so
[1440.12 → 1450.38] okay hold on a second if you have the guy who did this or the group who did this a lot of people would think
[1450.38 → 1455.04] that this part of this is immoral I can imagine Steve Jobs saying you know like this is our property
[1455.04 → 1459.36] and you guys are ruining it, and you're making uh the iOS experience like worse for everybody
[1459.36 → 1466.74] but they actually have their own kind of rationale of why this is better for everybody they said that um
[1466.74 → 1471.98] this will make iOS better for everyone because jail breakers and tweak developers will be able
[1471.98 → 1477.58] to jailbreak their phones on the latest version, and they'll not need to wait around
[1477.58 → 1483.24] um they won't have to stay on older iOS versions waiting for a jailbreak and for that reason they'll
[1483.24 → 1493.24] be safer yeah there are security um implications of using older versions of iOS um the thing for me
[1493.24 → 1502.06] though is that my iPhone 6s plus is not going to get iOS 14 but if I can stay on iOS 13 and this
[1502.06 → 1507.88] processor is vulnerable then what I can do is I can jailbreak this and add features that are later
[1507.88 → 1513.60] added to iOS, so yeah Apple wouldn't like that because then you're removing one incentive for
[1513.60 → 1518.08] you to upgrade to the next device right and right now there are very few watches the review
[1518.08 → 1527.22] Nick's here hey, hey Nick hey scoot scoot scoot scoot scoot you guys have stuff on the other
[1527.22 → 1533.56] side do you guys tell everybody about the good news of lttstore.com lttstore.com what's that wow
[1533.56 → 1538.38] um so we're launching a new shirt today did you talk about the new shirt we're launching? No not yet
[1538.38 → 1544.32] where's your new shirt James? Oh, here it is right here oh I'm supposed to wear this? Oh, I mean
[1544.32 → 1548.66] theoretically yeah that's why it's here oh what size was this one was this a small or this is a medium
[1548.66 → 1555.68] yeah that would not fit on me so uh we're launching new design GPU woo uh we'll have another new design
[1555.68 → 1560.74] theoretically next week as well so just so you guys now and then we're also running I heard there's a
[1560.74 → 1566.74] sale is that we're running the final elemental promo so if you remember the last time we did it four
[1566.74 → 1572.86] for fifty uh we are honouring the same deal four for fifty elemental t-shirts it gets automatically
[1572.86 → 1579.54] applied to your order when you add four elemental t-shirts of any size and slash or colour to your cart
[1579.54 → 1583.80] okay so you don't need a promo code or anything you just automatically select four put them in the
[1583.80 → 1589.06] cart or put it in get them while they're hot um we had a similar number available last time and it
[1589.06 → 1595.06] lasted less than eight hours I think so really get them while they're hot okay bye there he goes
[1595.06 → 1600.58] okay I guess we don't have any photos on the site, yet you can't tell that was a Naruto run you can uh
[1600.58 → 1605.14] now everyone's doing it yeah we're going to get the photos up very soon, but they can see them here yeah
[1605.14 → 1612.82] haha yeah we took photos today I was wearing this I don't get to keep one I'm I'm keeping this one I
[1612.82 → 1617.06] mean what else are they gonna use this size you just wear it home just wear it home that's all I've
[1617.06 → 1620.66] that's what I've been doing that's I mean I haven't had to shop for clothes in a while well I guess
[1620.66 → 1629.78] we're into the sponsors now so we might as well do that starting with Vertical yeah yeah check out
[1629.78 → 1638.34] these RGB chairs these are very visible they're here they're all show long by this point we are sure
[1638.34 → 1642.98] that you know who Vertical is they make super comfortable quality gaming chairs they're taking
[1642.98 → 1649.30] things to the next level with their RGB LED kits they feature wireless connectivity through your PC
[1649.30 → 1655.54] and customizable colour combinations with audio and visual sync they got accents and customized oh
[1655.54 → 1659.70] accents and customization will be available in a few months along with these RGB upgrade kits
[1659.70 → 1662.34] wait these are upgrade kits you don't even have to buy a whole new chair
[1662.98 → 1667.14] does this pop out uh yeah it feels like it pops out actually
[1667.14 → 1672.34] that's like it feels like it's its clipped in like there's a there's a little lip here like
[1672.34 → 1680.26] yeah yeah yeah oh yeah there's like a lock oh, oh my god okay I'm accessing the batteries and stuff
[1680.26 → 1686.10] that's why I went off well yeah oh god help us there we go oh boy yeah there's a power button back here
[1686.10 → 1691.46] oh cool what other mysteries oh wait
[1694.74 → 1699.38] anyway you can learn you can learn more today at the links in the video description or at
[1699.38 → 1707.70] birdgear.com sweet so speaking of sweet our next sponsor is savage jerky
[1708.90 → 1715.86] savage oh you do good voice stuff what makes a great jerky you may think it's
[1715.86 → 1723.06] flavour, but that's only the half of it what's the other half savage jerky is handcrafted in small
[1723.06 → 1730.26] batches to keep quality high while not having to use the can I smell one of those while not having
[1730.26 → 1736.10] to use the need yeah sure you want uh reaper oh god no I don't want to like to burn my nostril hair
[1738.02 → 1744.82] sriracha teriyaki yeah so uh without having to use uh any nitrates or preservatives to create the jerky
[1744.82 → 1752.02] they've got 13 different flavours from their sweet teriyaki to the intense spicy
[1752.02 → 1759.22] Carolina reaper i actually um I've got some of this at home um my partner actually
[1760.26 → 1768.42] straight up 100 loves this stuff but needs to get gloves to handle it like she can handle it in the
[1768.42 → 1775.06] mouth but like doesn't want to touch her eye later oh yeah oh god yeah that's happened and uh yeah
[1775.62 → 1781.38] let's let's also just say that it's its just as spicy on the other side, but yeah yeah don't scratch
[1781.38 → 1789.62] your butt later yeah it is absolutely ridiculous how uh how spicy that is uh so yeah they've got 13
[1789.62 → 1797.70] different flavours they also make hot sauces including this nice reaper sauce which uh yeah she's tried this
[1797.70 → 1805.06] as well, and it's actually perfect you don't do hot when stuff gets too hot I'm like kind of there
[1805.06 → 1810.02] but kind of not what about this one give that a sniff oh yeah that sounds perfect that smells pretty
[1810.02 → 1815.62] it doesn't smell spicy it smells like it smells sweet it smells like uh like buffalo bacon, but it's sriracha
[1815.62 → 1826.82] uh huh put it in their oh yeah maximum heat level holy cow
[1829.14 → 1833.06] have you ever had that I don't think so have you ever had anything with reaper in it
[1834.26 → 1845.06] I think so I had a bite of one of the um wait the reaper jerky uh pieces and uh yeah that was
[1845.06 → 1850.10] enough do you know that is this the hottest flavour they have or is the Carolina reaper one or a don't
[1850.10 → 1854.02] they a ghost pepper don't have a ghost pepper one oh reaper is hotter this is the is the hottest
[1854.02 → 1857.94] one reaper is hotter because I ate their early hot one on like the first time I was ever on a Sancho
[1858.66 → 1862.34] and I tried to be really cool you guys should go check that episode out I think you can see my
[1863.22 → 1868.18] the iris of my eyes turning black like there's liquid floating in them, I'm just like this is nothing
[1868.18 → 1872.74] Linus this is not freezing me at all but yeah it was bad for like the rest of the weekend
[1872.74 → 1879.14] wow really for that long no not really but definitely the next morning
[1880.18 → 1884.50] so you guys you can use offer code LTT to save 10 on all of their products including the
[1885.78 → 1894.58] 13 flavours of jerky and the sauce at leg.GG savage jerky like Linus my favourite is maple buffalo bacon
[1895.62 → 1900.34] you guys have that in common yeah we have that in common I really like it and I looked over there
[1900.34 → 1911.30] I think he's eating them all that's our Linus and our final sponsor lower third place is display
[1912.10 → 1916.66] just play right here I would touch that but I think parts of the wan will fall off
[1917.30 → 1922.98] yeah literally they did just that tile was falling off um I really think this looks like Justin Timberlake
[1922.98 → 1929.86] I might just get the game just for that really no okay I'll get it for because it's going to be a good
[1929.86 → 1936.50] game this plate is a magnet mounted metal print see this boom yeah comes right off
[1937.06 → 1944.74] right back well I meanwhile my hand's in the way there you go there you go they're durable you don't
[1944.74 → 1949.94] need any power tools to hang it there's over 260 000 different arts spanning a bunch of different styles
[1949.94 → 1955.06] and influences and with their easy magnet mounting there are no holes in the wall, and it's replaceable
[1955.06 → 1962.34] so you can just keep buying them and chucking them up how dare you why not oh Swedish colours Swedish
[1962.98 → 1969.78] what is this gonna what's this going to be something else I don't think there's any other
[1969.78 → 1975.22] displays over here right now did you know that they plant 10 trees for each display purchased I did not
[1975.22 → 1979.54] know that neither did I I don't see why they need to because they're not made of wood or anything
[1981.14 → 1989.54] why not sure if they should plant like 10 I don't know plant 10 aluminums 10 yeah 10 aluminums and 10
[1989.54 → 1996.98] magnets 10 magnets they've partnered with CD project red to create cyberpunk 2077 prints as you can see
[1996.98 → 2007.38] here so head to our link below and use code LTT to save 15 today Sunday Sunday Sunday and Monday
[2008.02 → 2014.66] all right that is it for sponsors let's get back to the good stuff boss dynamics is selling their spot
[2014.66 → 2020.82] robot now oh god they're selling something now okay they're they're leasing the spot robot do you know
[2020.82 → 2025.94] which one spot isn't that like the dog one it's the small dog one okay it used to be called spot mini
[2025.94 → 2032.82] now it's just called spot okay so they're leasing them and only to like hand-picked companies because
[2032.82 → 2037.38] I think they have limited quantities you can't just I don't think we could get one if we just wanted one
[2037.38 → 2043.30] that sucks yeah but what possible utility could they have why would they be leasing them yeah I think um
[2043.86 → 2048.74] it's not for everybody like when you watch their robots on YouTube you're like holy cow it's doing
[2048.74 → 2054.74] backflips this thing can do anything but in reality um like you're not seeing all the out takes
[2054.74 → 2060.18] of when it falls over or all the humans that are in the background helping out so there are very
[2060.18 → 2064.98] specific use cases, but those use cases do exist these robots can't do everything for you but they
[2064.98 → 2071.78] can do certain things really well so in the case of spot uh one example I read about was like let's
[2071.78 → 2076.82] say you're a site inspector and once a week you go to like a construction site, and you make sure that
[2076.82 → 2084.42] everything is laid where it's supposed to be with a spot mini that thing could just patrol the site
[2084.42 → 2092.34] every day and once the area is mapped it can actually detect changes so it can just tell you is like
[2092.34 → 2097.62] at a glance this is what's changed, and then you can look at the 360 like the stitched footage that it
[2097.62 → 2104.58] gives you and then just kind of do a visual inspection remotely so you can do a less good inspection more often
[2104.58 → 2114.82] hmm okay that's an interesting use case um I'd heard of lasers being used for that but like
[2115.78 → 2120.98] I think uh there are London metros that use lasers to do that kind of thing for surveying
[2122.02 → 2128.90] but I guess you can't really do that for everything well I guess that would require that's a human has
[2128.90 → 2134.02] to set that up every time then right well they're permanently installed I think oh okay, okay but
[2135.30 → 2141.06] at the same time that is a permanent installation and ends a contained like static environment yeah
[2141.70 → 2147.86] so like if you're looking at things that change over time in an in an environment that is like
[2148.50 → 2154.66] by definition always changing because it's like a build set or something yeah then yeah maybe I mean
[2154.66 → 2160.18] the fact that it can actually navigate as well yeah so it's its like kind of autonomous when you
[2160.18 → 2166.10] first get it you have to control it with a remote control and walk it around the area to map the area
[2166.10 → 2170.98] but then I think once it's mapped and its parameters are laid out, and it's walked around it and gone up
[2170.98 → 2176.42] all the stairs and everything after that then it can walk around autonomously and do the all the remapping
[2176.42 → 2182.58] itself and of course they're famously good at going over uneven terrain and like if the thing gets knocked
[2182.58 → 2188.50] onto like turtled onto its back it can still like wobble its legs and right itself and if it trips on
[2188.50 → 2196.58] stuff so that's pretty BA well apparently cirque de soil is looking at it is might incorporate them
[2196.58 → 2204.26] in some of their shows why like have you been to cirque de soil actually no they usually have like um
[2204.26 → 2210.42] comedians like clowns walking around amongst the audience I could see them doing something like that
[2210.42 → 2218.90] with it obviously it's not going to be doing backflips stereo cameras I think it has five cameras to
[2218.90 → 2225.06] begin with like that all of them get because there are different models they say that the that it costs
[2225.06 → 2231.78] about as much as a car, but cars have a huge range and so do these so it depends on the options you get
[2232.82 → 2238.66] I wouldn't specifically say that the operating environment information here is especially impressive
[2238.66 → 2246.42] ip54 I mean it's less than a phone from five years ago yeah like it seems like then again there's a lot
[2246.42 → 2252.42] more moving parts so I guess that is impressive payload capacity 14 kilograms
[2256.42 → 2261.38] applications okay here we go construction oil and gas for what inspect facilities
[2261.38 → 2271.78] public safety each one comes with five pairs of stereo cameras positioned around the machine okay
[2271.78 → 2277.14] its front cameras scan the ground ahead for obstacles and decide whether to climb over them or to dodge
[2277.14 → 2283.22] them all together so as I understand it if something is 30 centimetres or a foot or less than it'll mount it
[2283.22 → 2290.66] and go over that way but if it's larger than that then it just walks around and there's a pretty kick-ass
[2290.66 → 2295.22] looking controller almost looks like a second game gear like that it's got a big screen
[2295.22 → 2301.54] on it and i you can look through the screen it shows a feed from the robot's forward-facing cameras
[2301.54 → 2305.54] and uh you can send the machine to different wave uh waypoints I guess it's its kind of like looking
[2305.54 → 2312.10] at um google street that would be um I guess that would be here in the video here let's see if that
[2312.10 → 2317.86] shows up here it's two minutes long so yeah the video is mostly just this thing walking through various
[2317.86 → 2324.18] sets it looks like a pretty involved video honestly it looks expensive that's clearly CG though three
[2324.18 → 2331.62] miles an hour 90 minute run time that's pretty good because I thought that there are other robots like
[2331.62 → 2339.38] atlas only were ripping around wirelessly for like 15 minutes, and you can swap the batteries out god I can
[2339.38 → 2344.90] only imagine how much they charge for one of those batteries oh yeah
[2349.46 → 2354.50] uh you can add additional sensors on its back like lidar laser scanner for mapping environment in high
[2354.50 → 2359.62] detail and then that's obviously an add-on that weird dinosaur neck thing yeah
[2360.82 → 2364.98] that'd be can they I don't think they can interact like that though
[2364.98 → 2370.34] I don't know like can one hold the door for another they've done it they've done it in their
[2370.34 → 2376.66] um presentations like in their YouTube videos, but that can be just pre-rendered as it were you know
[2377.22 → 2381.22] they could have just pre-programmed that activity I don't know if they're like aware of each other to
[2381.22 → 2386.98] the extent that they could solve problems like that I imagine they are not but come to think of it is
[2386.98 → 2391.62] wouldn't be that difficult would it well but the refer- like most clients would probably just want one
[2391.62 → 2397.14] so if you have limited ability to uh invest your time on like building out certain features you're
[2397.14 → 2403.14] probably going to focus on the features on making one of them better and like the team-based stuff
[2403.14 → 2412.02] I would think would come like in v2 hmm oh man you see you buy these things to make your business more
[2412.02 → 2418.02] productive, but then everybody wants to look at it yeah, and then they become a pet like look at this
[2418.02 → 2427.78] look at this isn't that adorable it's cute wait can we show that without being like just demonetized
[2427.78 → 2436.82] right away uh I don't know if you can like just watch videos on your stream I know lots of other
[2436.82 → 2444.98] channels don't do that well I mean the damage is done I don't know it's an advertisement guy it's a
[2444.98 → 2449.62] thing we're looking at we were looking at the website first we can, it doesn't matter let us
[2449.62 → 2456.82] help you show your ad to more eyeballs don't content ideas Sony launches online PlayStation
[2456.82 → 2463.86] storefront for hardware and accessories oh yeah you can buy hardware Sony PlayStation hardware directly
[2463.86 → 2469.94] from Sony now on their same store it honestly feels a little bit strange that that hasn't been
[2469.94 → 2473.86] possible yeah so now you would think that they would have done that like as soon as they had the
[2473.86 → 2478.10] internet yeah well I mean you think Sony would have done a lot of things, but they actually were
[2478.10 → 2486.26] kind of behind uh Microsoft on many issues relating to online if you remember correctly if I remember
[2486.26 → 2496.74] correctly um it was PlayStation network was like really kind of bank at first, and they also released
[2496.74 → 2502.18] streaming like streaming media later than Microsoft did and I think Microsoft actually had an exclusive with
[2502.18 → 2508.02] Netflix for a little while so it was really on the back foot for a lot of the PS3 generation
[2509.06 → 2515.46] so just to back up PlayStation fans and gift givers can now visit a single destination to buy PlayStation
[2515.46 → 2520.66] games and hardware directly from PlayStation integrated with the playstation.com website you can
[2520.66 → 2528.50] now navigate from hardware and game product information pages directly to purchasing a PS4 a PS4 pro
[2528.50 → 2535.70] a PSV system and bundles as well as headsets dual shock 4 wireless controllers PSV accessories a selection of
[2535.70 → 2541.54] physical games you can actually buy discs from these guys and voucher codes for PS plus subscriptions
[2542.18 → 2545.38] and the prices on the site are going to be the same kind of thing you're going to find out
[2545.38 → 2551.78] the retailers it's not going to be more expensive but the new online store for now is open exclusively
[2551.78 → 2559.78] uh in the US oh well that's why I can't see it then they have a couple bundles here uh you can you
[2559.78 → 2566.82] tell me do you think this is a good deal a PlayStation 4 plus a 12-month subscription of TS plus for 400
[2566.82 → 2576.58] us dollars which is 20 savings compared to normal how much is a year PS plus is it 60 us or 50 us I don't
[2576.58 → 2583.14] know but i mean 20 bucks it's 20 bucks off like do you feel like that's the best they
[2583.14 → 2587.86] could do for this epic store launch yeah you would think that they would be like throwing in a
[2587.86 → 2593.86] PlayStation now or PlayStation not ps now is a different thing but the PlayStation plus account
[2594.58 → 2600.66] but I guess I mean they are giving away games every month so they also have a PlayStation 4 pro
[2600.66 → 2607.62] and a 12-month subscription of PS plus for 430 which is 30 off for the extra 30 bucks I go with the
[2607.62 → 2614.74] PS4 pro but like I don't know it's actually only it's kind of well I guess it's an extra 30 bucks but
[2614.74 → 2622.02] it's kind of only an extra 20 bucks in a way too because you save more that's that is just gambler logic
[2623.78 → 2629.46] I have a problem I mean either way 30 or 20 bucks like okay you're going out like you order a pizza or
[2629.46 → 2639.30] whatever like you cannot order a pizza and get a PS4 pro instead of a PS4 like i I don't
[2641.46 → 2647.22] I think I'm going to have the PS4 for dinner PlayStation plus members are eligible for free one day express
[2647.22 → 2653.38] shipping do you think a lot of people end up buying from this one day express honest I can't see many
[2653.38 → 2662.26] people doing it Amazon is already so um entrenched I guess in terms of like online sales I don't think
[2662.26 → 2663.54] that Sony is going to have
[2666.50 → 2673.38] the network for like just the logistics of shipping well they might they probably
[2673.38 → 2679.78] outsource that to somebody else well yeah but like unlike Amazon Sony has to keep all of this stuff in a
[2679.78 → 2684.82] warehouse somewhere Amazon has a like a distribution network they could be keeping them in Amazon warehouses
[2684.82 → 2690.10] for all we know well that could be they could, they might be drop-shipping them from Amazon so it's really
[2690.10 → 2698.26] about the portal like do you think there's going to be uh the ability to access this oh god oh what do we do
[2700.50 → 2707.78] um just wait 10 seconds
[2709.78 → 2719.78] so
[2727.70 → 2728.02] yay
[2731.06 → 2733.78] the last minute of wan show well
[2733.78 → 2740.98] is there going to be a link in the store or from the PlayStation from your PlayStation like HUD like
[2740.98 → 2748.66] dashboard on your console if it connects directly to the store, and it's its um displayed in a really
[2748.66 → 2756.10] user-friendly way they could get a lot of direct sales that way I guess like oh hey I've got the I'm
[2756.10 → 2761.22] looking at downloading this game, and it's got VR support oh hey here's the link to the PSP oh hey I can
[2761.22 → 2768.26] just buy that and have it tomorrow like that sounds pretty neat but is your auntie getting
[2768.26 → 2774.82] your Christmas present going to use playstation.com or your partner getting you a gift uh no
[2776.18 → 2782.42] although it's a maybe gift cards could be a good place to get gift cards yeah it would be like hey
[2782.42 → 2788.34] auntie instead of like going to Best Buy or Walmart can you get me a PlayStation store or credit card
[2788.34 → 2793.86] I want the credit on the PlayStation store I don't want I don't want to go to Best Buy maybe
[2793.86 → 2798.34] they'll have uh you know when you're at the drugstore and there's like a wall of gift cards yeah maybe
[2798.34 → 2802.10] they'll just have their own right there well they have like PlayStation store cards like that
[2802.90 → 2806.50] that you can like load I'm pretty sure you can load value on well if it's the same store then you'll
[2806.50 → 2811.30] just be able to use that towards hardware it's just they need larger denominations because you're
[2811.30 → 2815.30] buying hardware four hundred dollar ticket it's like maybe you get like a five hundred dollar
[2815.30 → 2820.82] PlayStation store card, and you can just like to buy a PlayStation which seems to be a little bit
[2820.82 → 2825.70] roundabout but I mean at least then you get to choose your PlayStation I guess yeah I guess so
[2828.42 → 2834.58] well that's it for that one last topic Alibaba unveils its first AI chip
[2836.66 → 2843.62] so the backstory to this is um in the world of cloud computing where Amazon has the most market share
[2843.62 → 2850.98] followed by I believe azure and then like who's after that maybe google fire like google firebase i
[2850.98 → 2859.94] think um Alibaba actually has like five percent market share I think weird no wait they're in
[2859.94 → 2867.46] the top five, and they're I think they're the biggest in China um bigger than Huawei it's all in the notes
[2867.46 → 2873.46] here let's see Alibaba unveiled its first chip to power artificial intelligence processes on Tuesday
[2873.46 → 2877.78] the move could boost its already fast-growing cloud computing business and signals china's
[2877.78 → 2883.78] growing ambitions in developing its own homegrown semiconductor industry the chip called I hate
[2883.78 → 2890.42] when I have to pronounce Chinese things called Han gang 800 can cut down computing tasks that would
[2890.42 → 2897.62] have usually taken an hour down to just five minutes the e-commerce giant claims which tasks
[2897.62 → 2902.50] yeah Alibaba said the chip is currently being used internally within the company's business
[2902.50 → 2908.18] operations especially in product search and automatic translation on e-commerce sites personalized
[2908.18 → 2913.54] recommendations advertising and intelligent customer services they're not going to be selling this as a
[2913.54 → 2918.10] standalone product instead the company is planning to use the chip in its cloud computing products and
[2918.10 → 2930.02] then offered those services um I'm trying to find the I know I have the I thought I had the uh market share things what I do have is that
[2930.02 → 2938.10] Beijing highlighted semiconductors as a key area of the made in China 2025 plan that they rolled out recently or in the last couple of years
[2938.10 → 2943.22] it's a government initiative that aims to boost the production of higher value products instead of
[2943.22 → 2949.94] you know just making plastic toys there they want to make chips stuff they want to eat intel's lunch
[2949.94 → 2960.26] delicious china aims to produce 40 of the summer semiconductors that it uses by 2020 and 70 by 2025.
[2960.26 → 2964.90] that's scary that's a lot 70 so
[2967.30 → 2972.90] are they planning on just using that that deal with AMD for like their desktop market share then
[2972.90 → 2980.82] like how many chips are fabricated in China now versus how many chips would have to be fabricated in China
[2981.70 → 2986.34] well I don't know if they just mean fabricated but they think they mean designed in China
[2986.34 → 2991.30] because when i I've spoken to people who are teachers in China and their students write essays
[2991.30 → 2997.86] for them and this uh common theme of these students essays is that a lot of things are made in China but
[2997.86 → 3002.58] very few things are designed in China and this next generation of kids wants to your know kind of change
[3002.58 → 3007.22] that instead of just following instructions from all the other companies so I would or other countries so
[3007.22 → 3012.98] I would assume that um they mean like actually made from like start to finish in China but when they say
[3012.98 → 3020.74] the 70 or 40 of the semiconductors it uses when they say it does they mean every person in the country
[3020.74 → 3026.34] like my desktop gaming pc at home or do they mean it referring to like the government of China like
[3027.46 → 3034.58] I have to assume that it means the government but that being said from what I understand I don't I don't
[3034.58 → 3042.82] really hmm no that's not how it works in China the government isn't everything it's just it's
[3042.82 → 3049.78] it's state capitalism is what it is um so yeah that seems like everything that the government uses
[3049.78 → 3056.18] is probably going to be what they're talking about here but with that being said in order for that to
[3056.18 → 3061.70] be economical they would need to then be able to sell that to customers in China
[3064.50 → 3069.06] because like yeah if you think about it like how are they going to get software how are they going to get
[3069.06 → 3074.66] like support for that kind of thing they need to have a full ecosystem that they're going to build
[3075.22 → 3082.82] if they're going to build semiconductors like AI chips CPUs GPUs all that kind of stuff like there are
[3082.82 → 3089.86] GPUs that are legitimately being designed and built in China and CPUs as well so like this is already
[3089.86 → 3096.82] happening but in order for that to take off and actually be useful for the Chinese government they
[3096.82 → 3103.70] would have to actually also create an ecosystem that the Chinese consumer would also want well
[3103.70 → 3109.38] unless they just focus on business because as you said there are many I guess they're like privately
[3109.38 → 3114.58] owned businesses but they have a lot of state influence they're kind of appendages of the state in
[3114.58 → 3121.14] some ways and so the state can kind of stipulate onto those companies that they use or do certain
[3121.14 → 3130.74] things so maybe they stipulate that all these companies must use china made semiconductors and that
[3130.74 → 3134.74] kind of that gives you become your own best customer, and it gives you a lot of volume and then you
[3134.74 → 3141.46] have to build out these ecosystems just to serve yourself whether it even goes to the consumer
[3142.98 → 3150.10] it seems like a bit of an uphill battle in that sense though but if the end goal is to create something
[3150.10 → 3158.34] that is all-encompassing then that makes more sense to me um just creating something for yourself
[3158.34 → 3164.98] for the sake of it being something you built I can't see that being really the thing that the Chinese government
[3166.34 → 3172.98] like that the hill they die on your know like it seems like there's something else behind that do you think their
[3172.98 → 3184.02] their technology is far behind no or even ahead I'm not sure if I would say ahead but um just as a result of
[3185.46 → 3190.82] not only corporate espionage that's that's all that's a thing even in the west like I'm not I'm not
[3190.82 → 3198.02] trying to crap on china here uh but as a result of that you know the great leap forward um and just as a
[3198.02 → 3207.94] result of china's uh modernization in terms of um its consumer sector and its electronics sector um
[3208.90 → 3215.86] I think that it will at least reach parity relatively soon like probably in the next I don't know
[3218.18 → 3225.70] I hesitate by 2025 I don't know about 2025 I hesitate to put a time frame on it though because like they
[3225.70 → 3230.10] already have really powerful supercomputers yeah they had the world's most powerful for a time there
[3230.10 → 3235.78] I think they've invested now plus they have more engineers more engineering graduates they have a lot
[3235.78 → 3243.86] of new young talent coming up more flexible slash non-existent patent law yeah that does help actually
[3243.86 → 3249.06] yeah like that's just kind of how America got where it is because patents originally were much looser
[3249.06 → 3255.14] than they are now well they're only they can't differentiate based on IP in that way so they can only just
[3255.14 → 3261.54] beat people by emanating innovating faster cheaper better yeah should we do some super chats
[3261.54 → 3271.86] yeah probably it's been an entire stream I think you just uh yeah give me a good one here
[3274.26 → 3279.94] I think that guy just said shoot me now please no shout me out please oh shout me out please okay hi
[3279.94 → 3287.06] uh Tommy gum 1928 no Luke no Linus still I expect a great wan show I hope we did that for you Tommy
[3287.06 → 3295.54] hopefully probably not though it's harsh uh folding mouth should out please oh folding month sweet oh
[3296.34 → 3301.62] folding month it's the thing quickly it's the time of folding the time if you guys don't know what that is
[3301.62 → 3306.58] you just download this client on your computer it's very easy to do, and basically you can just kind of
[3306.58 → 3314.26] offer the computing capacity of your machine to the greater good which is uh it's a distributing
[3315.22 → 3320.82] distributed computing network of people trying to fold proteins and so basically what defines a
[3320.82 → 3325.86] protein and what it can do is its physical structure and that structure is usually like a linear kind of
[3325.86 → 3332.98] like fold thing and so you use your computer to look at new structures and discover them and
[3332.98 → 3339.14] fight diseases like Alzheimer's and cancer and stuff yeah like especially anything to do with prions have
[3339.14 → 3347.54] you ever what's a prion uh they're terrifying but um mad cow disease is a prion disease okay um they're
[3347.54 → 3354.90] due to a protein folding in an irregular way and as a result it like starts to corrupt other proteins and
[3354.90 → 3360.50] yeah it's its terrifying, so folding is easy though and I did it last year for like a month and a half
[3360.50 → 3365.06] totally heated up my house which was great because it's winter time so I recommended you guys do it
[3365.06 → 3371.54] it's for a good cause and if you go through the forum at lionstechtips.com you can even get some
[3371.54 → 3378.10] cool badges by your name so I have all this forum clout now because I did that all these cool forum badges
[3378.58 → 3383.70] so I don't know the details there's actually like competitions and stuff and there 's's a LTT team
[3383.70 → 3387.78] and you can be ranked, and we're competing against other teams around the world I'm sorry I don't have the
[3387.78 → 3397.70] details about that right now but go to LTT the forum and uh join it do it now uh is this our team
[3397.70 → 3405.06] that looks like our team show everyone show us Anthony Linus tech tips team active CPUs within 50 days
[3405.06 → 3414.50] 4 865. I'm impressed that's a lot of CPUs team ranking 10 of 228 803. We're in 10th we're yeah we're
[3414.50 → 3418.90] only in 10th yeah, but that's that's pretty good that's pretty good we can do better than that
[3418.90 → 3423.78] though let's see oh hey there's Ben quickly he's the guy who actually showed this out yeah, yeah nice
[3423.78 → 3429.54] nice top 10 I think we actually have prizes we're giving out I think they talked with us on the last
[3429.54 → 3435.54] wan show but the community has gotten some prizes together and we ourselves have offered up some prizes
[3435.54 → 3442.82] for I guess the main contributors to this, so everybody go fold at home client is what you
[3442.82 → 3448.10] download, and it's very easy to turn off and on yeah think of it like bitcoin mining except less
[3448.10 → 3454.50] terrible and also well for a perfect because it's medical science super less terrible oh yeah
[3454.50 → 3456.82] what else we got what else we got here uh
[3460.18 → 3465.22] when will the Oculus Quest review be up it has been reported repeatedly referenced on the channel, but it's
[3465.22 → 3471.78] only on flow plane that's Val Jenkins yeah actually I think Monday is if it's uh this week the video did get
[3471.78 → 3477.06] delayed um but actually that turned out to have a silver lining in the delay because since we filmed
[3477.06 → 3482.58] it the um connect six conference happened, and they announced at least three things that were pertinent to
[3482.58 → 3487.78] uh Oculus Quest and our video so now we've been able to incorporate those new developments into the video
[3487.78 → 3492.66] and I believe it's uh it's going to come out next week nice yeah it is scheduled for Monday, but that may change so
[3492.66 → 3495.86] do not take that as verbatim but expect it soon
[3497.86 → 3502.10] uh let's see let's do one more okay let's make it a good one
[3504.02 → 3508.18] off this quest is actually wicked my I brought it home and I was very surprised I wanted to show
[3508.18 → 3512.26] all my friends, but it was my wife who got the most into it, and she is not a gamer at all
[3512.26 → 3518.18] all right lay it on me
[3520.90 → 3527.30] okay tech revamp says if you have the smart home and everything else you can buy into the system now
[3527.30 → 3533.38] and be wait is this like a or would you rather like a hypothetical this I don't I don't even know
[3533.38 → 3538.34] what this is actually I thought this was something different if you have the smart home and everything
[3538.34 → 3544.34] else you can buy into the system now and be possible be better off with later gen
[3546.82 → 3552.10] uh how like is this a question I don't know I don't know
[3554.34 → 3558.50] moving on yeah sorry tech uh
[3560.90 → 3562.50] for some of the new ones showing headphones alarm
[3562.50 → 3568.18] alarm headers my drums ear drums lesson learned that was Stephen Willis
[3568.18 → 3568.74] uh
[3570.82 → 3578.74] if the moon was made out of cheese would you eat the clips I would eat yeah why not
[3579.78 → 3585.06] yeah would you think that it would be a hard cheese or a creamy cheese um it would probably
[3585.06 → 3591.86] be creamier at the centre it seems like a hard cheese it'd be mostly hard cheese but the
[3591.86 → 3596.98] the divots on the moon the craters kind of look like those dimples like Swiss maybe a little bit
[3596.98 → 3600.50] yeah so that's kind of softer it's kind of got that that kind of white gray
[3602.98 → 3609.22] not really that's like more well it is gray it would be weird it looks more Swiss cheesy it'd be so
[3609.22 → 3614.18] weird to walk on something edible like imagine it actually you never stepped on food before
[3614.18 → 3620.02] not like not even accidentally not to the extent that I could like to do a bum drop on food like if
[3620.02 → 3625.78] you were on the actual moon and actually was made up cheese you know when you like to go down and eat
[3625.78 → 3631.70] snow like you go to an area of snow that's fresh snow that's untouched do that but yeah like you've
[3631.70 → 3635.86] never been like thirsty like you go skiing or something you're super thirsty, and then you go to
[3635.86 → 3640.02] an area like no one's there, and you just like to eat a little bit of snow I guess they'd be like the
[3640.02 → 3644.42] same etiquette with the cheese moon probably it would also probably either be really hot or really
[3644.42 → 3651.30] cold so oh true oh can you imagine it was super delicious, and you're starving, but you're in a space
[3651.30 → 3656.90] suit so you actually can't access it you just yeah it's like water everywhere not a drop to drink
[3656.90 → 3664.58] kind of style anyway this is getting weird let's let's sign off come back next week same bat time same
