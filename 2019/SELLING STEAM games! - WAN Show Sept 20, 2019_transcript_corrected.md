[0.96 → 8.56] come one come all to when show I hope this computer is working I haven't actually turned it
[8.56 → 16.64] on yet oh boy, and then you're going to get prompted to bios update did you do it no I haven't I think
[16.64 → 22.80] it might actually just be broken oh wow which would be spectacular we're off to a great start
[22.80 → 28.00] today guys awesome we got some interesting some great and some weird news uh steam users have
[28.00 → 34.40] the right to sell their digital games as far as I know just in France or so says a French court valve
[34.40 → 42.56] has vowed to fight the ruling so let's see how that goes for them interesting in other news um UFD tech
[42.56 → 49.60] is moving out from South Africa back to the United States in order to seek better medical care
[49.60 → 54.88] for his son we'll be able to discuss that a little bit later Facebook plans to create an independent
[54.88 → 62.56] oversight board oh yeah and uh YouTube just dunked a huge amount of creators verification badges
[63.28 → 68.88] thanks guys I happen to know someone who used to be verified who is no longer verified
[68.88 → 74.32] you probably know I will tell you where I will tell you later that's my hook that's my hook intro
[74.32 → 82.00] I think like almost everyone does
[82.00 → 90.64] the one
[95.44 → 108.64] Squarespace and see sonic oh see sonic a sponsor today yeah cool all right let's go ahead and see if my
[108.64 → 114.32] laptop's working and one two oh wow look at that okay cool we're on we're on we got a show
[114.32 → 119.04] today nice background lucky thanks I actually have no idea where that came from I think it's just one
[119.04 → 122.88] of the windows images yeah it's probably a hp thing they probably included that
[122.88 → 130.88] that makes sense so why don't we jump right into the headline topic yes French court has ruled that steam
[133.52 → 137.84] should okay you know what here let's go let's go through let's go through our detailed notes first and
[137.84 → 143.36] then we'll actually then we'll actually discuss, so a new ruling by a French court has the potential to
[143.36 → 148.80] radically alter the way people buy sell and play video games particularly online because the way that
[148.80 → 155.52] we used to buy sell and play video games back in the day of the physical cartridges was already like this
[156.40 → 163.28] I could go to a store where they from a manufacturer presumably receive a shipment of games
[163.28 → 172.48] I could buy it and then once I bought it yes it was still governed by a licensing agreement it was a
[172.48 → 179.52] license for the software I didn't own it the source code wasn't mine but this copy of it was effectively
[180.08 → 186.56] mine to do with as I pleased I could a certain degree I could lend it to you and then I could get it back
[186.56 → 193.44] from you later I could sell it to you and then never get it back from you, I could lend it to you and
[193.44 → 196.40] never get it back from you that's another one that happened a lot that happened a lot
[199.12 → 205.28] okay I think I might still have a couple of games or I could take it back to the store, and you know get
[205.28 → 214.00] a trade-in credit towards another game I could be a store whose entire business r.i.p is to except for
[214.00 → 219.12] willow video games except for willow video games yeah you are such a willow fan I love those guys
[219.12 → 225.60] how do they still exist probably me no I haven't even been in their in months but um they still rent
[225.60 → 232.40] videos I know right like that's a notable amount of their business it's crazy isn't it um I have a
[232.40 → 236.48] copy of fanboys at home that my sister said I should watch she said I'd like it, I've actually never
[236.48 → 240.88] seen the movie, but it has a blockbuster sticker on the top of it so clearly it was one of their
[240.88 → 247.20] rentals at one point anyway the point is it used to be that back when the game license was effectively
[247.20 → 255.68] tied to a physical object um there were rules that sort of intrinsically existed, and they still do
[255.68 → 262.72] for physical copies of games but for years French consumer rights group UFC not that UFC
[264.72 → 269.60] have been embroiled in a legal battle with valve corporation over several clauses in the company's
[269.60 → 275.04] steam user agreement particularly the one that states that you don't actually own games that
[275.04 → 282.72] you purchase on their digital storefront you are merely subscribing for an undetermined period of time
[282.72 → 290.16] to the games in your library so here's the thing though this clause means that steam users don't have
[290.16 → 295.84] certain basic consumer rights like for example the ability to resell the games they buy now yeah valve
[295.84 → 301.76] has gotten quite a bit more flexible over the way that people use their steam games over the years
[301.76 → 309.12] I still remember what a big deal it was when Luke figured out that thanks to a new rule from valve
[309.12 → 317.28] he could mooch off of the Linus tech tips steam account and play all the latest games because i
[317.28 → 322.96] wouldn't care because effectively I was getting uh deeper save games that I could use for benchmarking
[322.96 → 327.68] and he wins because he gets to play single player gaming experiences without buying the game yeah
[328.00 → 332.48] everybody everyone's a winner it was great I was okay with it, I noticed none of your pcs are
[332.48 → 336.80] actually I think you I think your stream just buys you every game now don't they pretty much wow
[337.52 → 340.64] you're such a're still a mooch you know uh you found a better way to move I don't even have to
[340.64 → 347.12] ask anymore I was uh okay what's that huge new game cyberpunk's not even going to be out
[347.12 → 352.48] for a while and I like talked on stream for a little bit about how like I'll probably be playing that game
[352.48 → 357.12] because it seems really cool and then someone just bought it for me and I was like oh great sweet
[360.80 → 364.56] it was awesome first you sleep in the bed of the dead guy
[367.28 → 372.24] I haven't replaced that you take all his cutlery yeah okay then you have people buying
[372.24 → 378.00] you're not ashamed at all still got his couch is wonderful it's great okay, okay for context
[378.00 → 383.52] guys and his computer chair for context guys this was an estate sale for Luke's house it came fully
[383.52 → 389.60] furnished he didn't like to steal it or anything he bought if it's just a little weird that he kept it
[389.60 → 395.76] all I didn't keep all of it I got rid of some of it you sold it didn't you um it the stuff that I got
[395.76 → 398.72] rid of was not really worth like it wouldn't have anybody would have bought it
[398.72 → 407.92] anywho so to valve's credit over the years they've actually gotten a lot more flexible with things like
[407.92 → 413.92] family sharing which they haven't even locked down the same way that Spotify is planning to with their
[413.92 → 419.12] family plan where you're all supposed to be at the same address and stuff so no, but they will invalidate
[419.12 → 424.88] it every once in a while they do, and you have to be like kind of nearby yeah, but it's nothing that
[424.88 → 430.32] can't be solved with a quick team viewer session yeah so it's not really they're not aggressive a
[430.32 → 438.48] big deal yeah exactly they could be locking it down yeah far tighter, and they're not but something
[438.48 → 444.32] that people have been upset with valve about for many years is the fact that you can't return a
[444.32 → 449.60] game basically after you've opened it, although they did loosen that I think you can play it for
[449.60 → 454.56] like 20 minutes or something now I forget two hours but I think it's fairly unofficial
[454.56 → 458.32] but two hours seems to be the like if you ask for a refund within two hours you'll pretty much
[458.32 → 464.32] just get it kind of limit so they've even got more flexible about that, but you cannot resell
[464.32 → 470.48] your games when you are done with them, they just sit in your library forever I have like 240 games in
[470.48 → 476.40] my library I have a kind of fun video that I'm planning coming up um so I might stream maybe on
[476.40 → 480.72] float plane or something that'd be kind of fun but I might stream yeah you love anytime I say
[480.72 → 488.24] the f word you're so happy um but yeah so I might stream it but then also cut it together as a
[488.24 → 494.88] YouTube video okay I'm going to play every unopened game in my steam library every unopened so all zero
[494.88 → 500.96] minute played yeah wow were you on the humble bundle stuff at all oh yeah oh in the early days
[503.52 → 508.64] yeah until I realized that my steam library was just cluttered up with garbage that I've never played
[508.64 → 513.12] and some gems that I've never played so we'll find out which is which yeah I'm very sure I've never
[513.12 → 519.36] played ft for example i I have owned it for like six years I love that game I know you do yeah yeah
[519.36 → 523.44] you had some ship or something you're going to beat some mission I don't know it was in your stream oh i
[523.44 → 529.68] did the no shield I did the no shield challenge yeah who cares sounds lame such a nerd it was
[529.68 → 537.20] really hard I'm pretty yeah I'm proud of that did you do it I did okay good job thanks nerd um okay
[538.24 → 545.76] so the district court of Paris has struck down the notion that steam sells subscriptions according to
[545.76 → 552.72] the court steam sells game licenses much in the same way that you owned a game license back when you bought
[552.72 → 558.80] a disc or that you own a movie license when you buy a Blu-ray or whatever the case may be and that
[558.80 → 564.72] consumers ought to have the right to do what they want with them the court also took valve to task
[564.72 → 569.60] for other practices like holding on to steam wallet funds when players leave the platform
[569.60 → 574.72] their unclear moderation policies not accepting responsibility if users computers are harmed by
[574.72 → 580.72] software even betas sold on their platform now the legal battle isn't over, yet our notes say valve
[580.72 → 585.20] is certain to appeal which is an indication that these notes were done in the morning because valve
[585.20 → 593.44] has already said they are going to appeal um, and it's and like regardless of the outcome of valve's
[593.44 → 599.76] appeal this could set off a series of similar challenges across the EU and therefore potentially
[599.76 → 607.76] elsewhere in the world and this is big too uh UFC Kush was yours has said that they plan to directly
[607.76 → 615.28] challenge other digital products and platforms so I mean another great example of this to my knowledge
[615.28 → 621.04] once you have activated it there's no way to sell a Windows 10 license yeah they could end up going
[621.04 → 629.68] after freaking Microsoft what and that would actually be pretty funky yeah a lot of this would be really
[629.68 → 638.00] funky what do you think um i want like kind of two different answers one gaming platforms
[638.80 → 643.84] steam origin you play all that kind of stuff two software all other software okay
[646.24 → 653.04] gaming platforms i as a consumer did you want me as a consumer me as a business owner which hat should I
[653.04 → 658.48] wear i think it's an overall what do you think's best for like the world you're going to get
[658.48 → 666.00] different hats I like it that works is that your business owner how about me as Santa this gives me
[666.00 → 673.60] less to give away so I'm I'm gonna I'm going to go with um Santa's kind of a business owner right okay, okay
[673.60 → 685.44] so as a business owner it's goods um I see games as um okay I see the inability of people to resell games
[685.44 → 694.08] as necessary to enable the ongoing existence of certain gaming experiences okay and
[694.08 → 702.00] I'm going to explain what I mean by that, so cod is not going to be affected by this because for the entire
[702.00 → 708.24] lifespan that cod is still actively being purchased like a particular cod game right it's all about the
[708.24 → 714.56] multiplayer experience nobody's buying a cod game in order to play through the single player campaign
[714.56 → 719.60] and then like be done the game you pick out you pick it up every once in a while I'm sure
[719.60 → 726.24] there's three of you don't freak out yeah, yeah all dozens of you sorry um so so something like
[726.24 → 733.28] a data 2 where obviously the business model has moved on right yeah from from the single purchase
[733.28 → 741.36] and then um you know people just play against each other like forever paradigm like that that's not
[741.36 → 747.36] sustainable unless you do you know community created servers much like older games used to yeah
[747.36 → 752.64] so it's free data 2 yeah yeah I know okay yeah no that's why I was using data 2 as an example of
[752.64 → 759.04] something has that has moved on from the paradigm of a single purchase and then the developer just kind
[759.04 → 763.92] of going okay the game's done we're going to make our next game we're going to make data 3 right like that
[763.92 → 770.24] that paradigm is sort of a sort of it's not dead, but many genres have moved past it particularly in the
[770.24 → 779.60] multiplayer space yeah but what about single player what do they have to either do I mean you
[779.60 → 783.76] know what I'm not going to call them LCS I'm going to call them expansion packs because for whatever
[783.76 → 789.20] reason expansion pack is still an okay word to say but DLC is a dirty one they're the same damn thing
[789.20 → 796.64] so, so single player could do LCS they could add extra dungeons or campaigns or characters or equipment and
[796.64 → 801.84] and they could expand on the game and get you to keep contributing towards their development efforts
[801.84 → 807.04] that way, or they could move on to the next game and say okay that game is done um
[809.20 → 817.12] and the problem with that is that I think for a lot of consumers they're kind of done with that game
[817.68 → 824.64] once they've played through it because I don't know about you but for me, i I don't find that any
[824.64 → 829.68] single player experience has ever kept me in for very long by just throwing more LCS or more
[829.68 → 837.04] expansion packs at me, it's extremely uncommon that I'll even go back like a new DLC will come
[837.04 → 842.56] out or whatever I'm not going to go back for a DLC if like back in the warcraft days I'd buy an expansion
[842.56 → 849.12] because it's an entirely different freaking game but like warcraft frozen throne was okay warcraft 3 yes
[849.12 → 855.84] warcraft 2 I would make the argument that uh what is it beyond the dark portal is not a different game
[855.84 → 861.44] it's like some maps' oh okay see, but that's something I wouldn't come back for right so in that situation
[861.44 → 868.88] i it's very unlikely and even a game that it is very hard for me to say this because Final Fantasy 6
[868.88 → 873.60] holds a very special place in my heart but even for a game that is arguably my favourite game of all
[873.60 → 878.16] time breath of the wild is a great game I didn't even bother to play the DLC it's like no I beat canon
[878.16 → 884.80] and I'm done yeah um it feels, and it also feels very weird coming back to those games so here's
[884.80 → 892.96] the problem um particularly games that are story like narrative driven games are kind of done once
[892.96 → 900.88] you finish the narrative content um and in the old days a lot of the time games were kind of um
[902.00 → 907.68] simpler like something like a pilot wings uh first nest did you ever play pilot wings yeah I didn't play
[907.68 → 911.28] it back in the day actually but I've played it more recently it was more about like playing fun
[911.28 → 915.76] little mini-games it was a pack of mini-games and so there 's's no story or anything so you know
[915.76 → 920.64] i I don't feel like as a game developer I'm at risk of I feel like this argument has gotten very mean dry
[920.64 → 929.68] and I'm very sorry the point is depending on the gaming experience there is no way for a game developer
[929.68 → 937.52] to incentivize players who have already made their lump sum purchase and own the game to keep playing
[937.52 → 945.68] it and keep wanting to own it there's just no practical way to do it and the unfortunate thing
[945.68 → 952.80] about digital distribution is that digital distribution works not just for a game publisher
[952.80 → 960.72] but also for a user so if there's a way for me to effectively become a digital distributor of my
[960.72 → 968.16] personal game library then the advantage of digital distribution is that you've got this enormous
[968.16 → 975.04] customer base so back in the day it wasn't as much of a concern because the barriers that naturally
[975.04 → 982.64] existed for physical media like finding a buyer and shipping a physical game cartridge to someone
[982.64 → 992.08] or delivering it to their house made it less prevalent um whereas now the ease with which you could
[992.08 → 999.20] resell something and flip it effectively reducing the original seller's ability to sell another copy
[999.20 → 1008.80] to that person is incredible so what happens to the game developers who now really will like I don't
[1008.80 → 1014.24] have to do a study to prove this it's its very obvious the game developers who really will sell
[1015.36 → 1022.40] many fewer copies of their games if they happen to be a style of gameplay that lends itself to
[1022.40 → 1027.04] playing through once being done with it and just wanting to get rid of it like this game I just brought
[1027.04 → 1035.60] up valve it was one of the old school uh humble bundle games yeah there are billions of these out
[1035.60 → 1041.20] here my stream gave away probably potentially in the hundreds because I've had this weird thing that
[1041.20 → 1047.12] we used to do if everyone that had this game suddenly was like I'm just going to sell it you
[1047.12 → 1053.52] right click on you click sell go ah put it 0.1 under current undercut market value whatever let's go
[1053.52 → 1057.84] it's going to be a couple pennies right now it's selling for five dollars and 49 cents that developer
[1058.48 → 1064.00] is just going to get nothing from what they made now so digital is like too easy, so there is an
[1064.00 → 1069.36] argument to be made remember I have my uh my like game developer publisher I have my business hat on
[1069.36 → 1075.28] right now um so from a business person or from a consumer perspective here I think I need a new hat
[1076.56 → 1082.24] one moment please what's the consumer going to be um you could like low-key mock them and wear a clown hat
[1082.24 → 1091.04] i I was thinking about it but I'm going to go with this nice okay so from a consumer perspective
[1092.80 → 1099.20] that's not my problem perfect choice true yeah you developed your game, and you got paid for it
[1099.20 → 1108.24] and what you want to be paid for this game forever get a job make a new game no, no I mean come up with a
[1108.24 → 1115.36] new idea I want more games to play I'm done playing this game I paid my money I should get something
[1115.36 → 1121.92] back for it because I'm done with it, I don't need this anymore I think it would hurt indie games a lot
[1121.92 → 1127.92] which makes me sad that makes me not want to be on board okay so I'll just be me now as consumer hat
[1127.92 → 1134.88] that's me being consumer hat so my favourite game in the last I don't know year whatever I'll pick an
[1134.88 → 1141.04] arbitrary period of time ever since I played breath of the wild um is uh an indie game it's very small
[1141.04 → 1146.48] very small development studio uh that made a game called cross code um did you ever play it I played
[1146.48 → 1153.44] it is a little bit you suck okay so cross code is uh like an old school RPG style game, but it's actually
[1153.44 → 1157.92] I think a mostly western development team I've played it since then I just haven't played a ton because i
[1157.92 → 1160.88] told you i I don't want to play it on stream it doesn't feel like a stream game that's fine you just
[1160.88 → 1165.12] suck that's what's going to take me forever to finish it yeah it's fine that you suck like it's
[1165.12 → 1173.76] cool like that's your life choice what a jerk um anyway sorry, sorry so tiny development studio
[1174.40 → 1179.92] um, and they're actually these guys are so incredible because they're actually still adding content to the
[1179.92 → 1187.28] game even though the know initial rush of people buying it is clearly far from over and
[1187.28 → 1192.64] they're doing free DLC they're not asking for any additional money for it um there's no subscription
[1192.64 → 1197.28] fee to pay it there's nothing like that it's one and done, and they keep adding content super cool
[1197.28 → 1206.32] guys um I don't know how they could possibly survive if people were able to sell this game once they were
[1206.32 → 1212.48] done with it because it's very narrative and character driven and now that I finished I might do a
[1212.48 → 1219.04] couple arena challenges, but that's not gonna that's not going to entertain me I'm I'm sitting here
[1219.04 → 1223.76] bated breath for cross code 2 which will probably take another seven years or however long the first
[1223.76 → 1230.40] one took them um, so the thing is that while they did probably make a bunch of money on this game
[1231.28 → 1233.44] developing it selling it um
[1233.44 → 1244.96] um the feast and famine game development model is not sustainable that has been basically proven where
[1244.96 → 1251.04] you were you invest really heavily in something, and you're you're kind of you're running on fumes
[1251.04 → 1257.44] by the time it's finally time to release it you get this huge influx of money, and then you go
[1257.44 → 1264.32] okay I want to hear everyone's best pitch what's the next gigantic gamble that we take that is either
[1264.32 → 1273.92] going to make us or break us as a company okay go let's do it again that is not sustainable so um
[1275.68 → 1282.80] i actually you know what I'm going to say it I'm going to say that the benefits of digital distribution
[1282.80 → 1287.52] things like uh steam summer sales which maybe haven't been that great in recent years but
[1287.52 → 1291.68] certainly it used to be killer a better deal than it used to be going to the local London
[1291.68 → 1298.40] drugs and buying a game so the fact that discounts are so readily available um the fact that cloud
[1298.40 → 1303.84] auto saves are a thing wow they're amazing I love it um what else can you think of that's great about
[1303.84 → 1308.64] digital distribution the fact that you can buy a game in the middle of the night and then just play
[1308.64 → 1315.20] it immediately it's freaking awesome library sync so like oh you set up a new laptop it doesn't have
[1315.20 → 1319.44] a disk drive you can just download all your things immediately you don't have to worry about it yep
[1319.44 → 1324.56] uh digital rights management and I don't mean that from a restrictive sense I mean that from a management
[1324.56 → 1331.12] sense so having the digital rights to share my game library with Luke so he can play that game if I'm
[1331.12 → 1337.44] not playing it right now I am going to go ahead and say that from my perspective the benefits of digital
[1337.44 → 1345.84] distribution have been so great that I am willing to give up my right to sell games um I can see how
[1345.84 → 1353.60] you could make an argument i kind of wish there was a solid alternative like i I wish that I could go
[1353.60 → 1359.12] out and buy more physical copies of games I've brought that up a lot and I would do that for a lot of games
[1359.12 → 1364.00] there are a lot of games where I'm like I'm fairly certain I'm going to like this a lot, and it's not gonna
[1364.00 → 1369.84] necessarily be super popular with everybody so I want to buy it so I can hand it to my friend so he
[1369.84 → 1375.92] can go play it and then in a lot of cases being adults now if I can tell they're really interested
[1375.92 → 1380.40] I might even be like hey give it back, and then they have to buy it themselves if I want to support the
[1380.40 → 1385.20] company very much or whatever that's another thing that sometimes it's hard for me to keep track of is
[1385.20 → 1391.76] that I am an adult now I have you know a real job sort of um, but the point is I make enough money that
[1391.76 → 1396.48] spending fifty dollars or sixty dollars or twenty dollars or whatever it is on a game periodically
[1396.48 → 1405.28] is not a huge deal for me um and I guess that's where you have to try to like how do you like how
[1405.28 → 1408.88] do you solve I've tried to be somewhat reasonable about certain things like rocket league yeah I've
[1408.88 → 1413.12] played a crazy amount of rocket league yeah so every once in a while I'll be I'll buy one of their like
[1413.12 → 1418.64] past things right but I don't buy them all the time well only if I'm gonna play like a lot for a while
[1418.64 → 1426.08] because I'm like okay well I got way more massively more value out of the original purchase that I like
[1426.08 → 1430.64] probably should have so I'll throw them a few extra bones now they're part of epic so I don't care that
[1430.64 → 1435.52] much but what I'm thinking about is more like back in the day when I was a student and I wasted all my
[1435.52 → 1441.68] money on my computer hardware so I didn't have any money for games you know not having that as an option
[1441.68 → 1447.36] kind of sucks but then again that was right around the time like my like early university days late high
[1447.36 → 1451.44] school days was right around the time steam started to actually gain some traction yeah um
[1452.48 → 1459.92] and I switched over pretty quickly not completely because every once in a while physical copy of
[1459.92 → 1467.04] the game would be cheaper so I own far cry for example on five CDs um don't want to talk about it
[1471.28 → 1476.16] that's amazing yeah it's so stupid anyway um actually I think that was slightly before steam
[1476.16 → 1480.32] took anyway it doesn't matter the point is there's like games from after the steam era that I like
[1480.32 → 1487.84] own on like a bunch of CDs or something stupid I couldn't find the DVD copy um but by and large I did
[1487.84 → 1491.68] switch to buying them digitally even though I didn't have a ton of money at the time but I would just wait
[1491.68 → 1496.24] for them to be on sale it's just that a lot of the time yeah because the physical media business the
[1496.24 → 1502.32] physical games business was struggling so much they were doing deeper discounts than digital which made no
[1502.32 → 1507.76] sense because like a physical item had to be like stamped and boxed and like shipped somewhere yeah
[1508.24 → 1515.04] and warehouse um yeah I think for I think the most frustrating series of time for me was when they
[1515.04 → 1519.36] first started shifting over to like oh you buy the physical copy and there isn't even a disc in it
[1519.36 → 1524.72] there's just a code in the box that was dumb that was pretty I think there's like still doing
[1524.72 → 1530.08] that yeah and that's just stupid I remember working at NCI we'd be doing like a game promo partnered with
[1530.08 → 1535.92] intel or NVIDIA or whatever where your graphics card would come with a free game and like it would
[1535.92 → 1542.48] come with a box that would just have a steam code, and we're like why are we shipping this yeah
[1542.48 → 1548.64] like are you guys idiots yeah can you stop can you just give me a piece of paper yeah coupons later
[1548.64 → 1558.16] yeah great yeah it was a perfect thing um all right so someone in chat Luke I'm suing Bethesda
[1558.16 → 1560.64] over that exact issue you're suing them
[1563.84 → 1572.72] how go ham good luck yeah minimax is a pretty experienced litigator as companies go they're uh
[1572.72 → 1580.08] they're pretty down to fight in courts yeah um so good luck everybody yeah um all right speaking of
[1580.08 → 1587.12] good luck everybody um wishing the best to UFD tech um Brett's going to be moving his family back to
[1587.12 → 1592.64] the United States in order to seek better medical care for his son uh so Brett's son has snap one
[1592.64 → 1598.32] uh basically it's a disorder that causes seizures and is has been very challenging for them to treat
[1599.28 → 1605.04] this situation is developing very quickly um, so the family has been forced to move very abruptly
[1605.04 → 1609.92] he released a video you guys should go check it out uh we've actually got a link down below there's a
[1609.92 → 1615.44] bunch of ways that you can help out Brett one of them is he's got to go fund me um another one is he's on
[1615.44 → 1622.16] Patreon another one is of course you can subscribe on float plane um he also does streams on twitch of
[1622.16 → 1628.48] disciple they have merch over on tee spring uh but basically their plan is to be back in the U.S.
[1628.48 → 1633.52] by the end of the year maybe sooner they're moving to Florida where there are better doctors available for
[1633.52 → 1641.60] his condition um however this is going to be a period like i I don't get the I don't get the impression
[1641.60 → 1648.00] that he's asking for a handout um Brett's one of those guys that uh whatever you might think about
[1648.00 → 1651.84] the content not everybody likes it that's fine that's cool but Brett's one of those guys that
[1651.84 → 1657.76] has clearly reinvested um a lot of his YouTube earnings in his business trying to make UFD tech
[1657.76 → 1664.72] a real business um so I don't think that this is just um a cynical cash grab or anything I think that
[1664.72 → 1670.08] they really do need some funds in order to help them uh get through this transition because it's going to
[1670.08 → 1674.24] be very difficult not just for Brett and his family but for the other members of the UFD team
[1674.24 → 1682.40] at this time um none of the other members of their team have U.S. visas so uh he's basically been
[1682.40 → 1688.40] selling all the camera equipment it looks like he's going to have to disband the team um so his channel
[1688.40 → 1693.60] I'd be surprised if he doesn't come back making videos again at some point I mean you got to have a
[1693.60 → 1699.28] job you got to support your family especially um if you're getting medical care in the U.S. yeah
[1700.24 → 1704.96] um so like I'm sure there's going to be videos, but you know they might take on a bit of a different
[1704.96 → 1711.52] form, and they might need a little bit of help bridging the gap here so um I'm not much of an I'm
[1711.52 → 1717.60] not I'm not Mr beast I'm not going to be like surprising random twitch streamers with donations
[1717.60 → 1722.40] live or anything but I'll be making a personal contribution um and I just thought I'd bring it up on
[1722.40 → 1726.32] the stream so that you guys are aware of the situation I mean the tech whether it's Austin's
[1726.32 → 1732.40] house burning down or what's going on right now with UFD tech I think the tech tuber community has
[1732.40 → 1738.72] sort of I wouldn't call it an obligation but has an um a tendency to kind of stick together and
[1738.72 → 1742.64] support each other, so yeah just want to make sure that you guys know what's going on down there
[1742.64 → 1748.80] they're doing pretty the only numbers i can see or say publicly because I guess we have
[1748.80 → 1753.76] flow planes um but the only numbers I can say publicly as far as I know is the GoFundMe one
[1753.76 → 1759.68] and they're at like almost 53 000 now wow that's awesome of a ten thousand dollar goal that's a big
[1759.68 → 1768.00] deal but again medical stuff in America so yeah that's like uh three hours I think maybe well i
[1768.00 → 1772.48] actually don't know I know that it's ridiculous yeah I have no clue I have I don't know how to scale
[1772.48 → 1777.36] that at all I remember finding out how much it costs to have a baby yeah in America I was like
[1778.32 → 1784.08] what it was free here yeah well I mean nothing's free you probably had to pay for parking yeah like
[1784.08 → 1790.24] i yeah oh yeah and parking at the hospital it's expensive but like in the grand scheme of things
[1790.24 → 1795.60] it was you know over the six-day period or whatever and plus people visits like 70 bucks or really yeah
[1795.60 → 1801.52] yeah grand scheme of things nothing um compared to like tens of thousands of dollars which is
[1801.52 → 1805.36] apparently what it costs down in the states if you are not insured do you even have to pay for food
[1805.36 → 1811.36] because they like feed you in the hospital right they probably feed like the admitted I mean like
[1811.36 → 1816.16] maybe you had to get your own food yeah yeah I mean I had to pay for my own food yeah yeah yeah only
[1816.16 → 1824.16] only the person in the hospital yeah gets food yeah um, but even that like wow okay yeah so pretty uh
[1824.16 → 1830.00] pretty crazy stuff guys best of luck um speaking of best of luck um

[1927.92 → 1938.64] topic yeah YouTube has slashed the verification the verified user roster every once in a while YouTube
[1938.64 → 1943.76] just comes in out of nowhere and is like and gives us a golden gift here's what you needed
[1943.76 → 1950.88] delivered perfectly to your door staff um yeah so I don't know do you want to be okay before we get
[1950.88 → 1956.48] into YouTube canning verification badges for a bunch of users you have some updates on float plane that you
[1956.48 → 1961.60] can share right you guys are on target to hit your we're on target in 10 days we were talking
[1961.60 → 1965.92] about I want to know what's actually going to be live in 10 days you have to commit to the people it's
[1965.92 → 1972.48] less than 10 days it's 10 is oh pretty sure that's how it works that's 10 yeah I don't know why i
[1972.48 → 1978.32] counted through them all I know how many days it is yeah uh so no one on the team has told me there
[1978.32 → 1983.28] would be a problem with anything yet speak now or forever hold this happens he's giving you this
[1983.28 → 1990.32] happens every time we have freaking problems every time but no one has said there's going to be a problem
[1990.32 → 1996.88] this time so we're launching yearly payments which people have been asking for freaking ever yeah
[1996.88 → 2000.48] because we used to have them back when it was running through the forum not that they actually
[2000.48 → 2006.72] worked correctly, but we technically have them so we're launching yearly payments we're uh what
[2006.72 → 2012.48] else is even coming comment moderation which shouldn't matter to any of you guys, but that's coming
[2013.60 → 2016.24] just saying um what's this four
[2018.96 → 2019.36] four
[2021.36 → 2025.60] one four 14 you're tallying things
[2025.60 → 2030.96] angled less than four
[2034.32 → 2034.80] four k
[2037.60 → 2038.16] four k's
[2041.76 → 2044.96] okay sorry I didn't get that the other part was supposed to be a line
[2046.16 → 2051.84] it's a k in American sign language a b c d e I don't know American language yeah don't worry about it
[2051.84 → 2058.00] what it kind of looks like a k, but there's no line yeah whatever it's cool uh
[2059.20 → 2065.28] 4k is coming okay so 4k is coming, but it has to be like turned on by the creators, and they're probably
[2065.28 → 2071.12] going to want to add additional plans that like cost more to turn that on so 4k is going to be ready
[2071.12 → 2075.28] platform wise right away but I don't know how long it's going to take until things actually like
[2075.28 → 2081.52] like come out on the platform at 4k and until you're able to actually like to see it and stuff
[2082.32 → 2090.32] and then some back end stuff is being worked on and I think that's sort of it sweet yeah yeah uh
[2090.32 → 2096.48] apparently they backtracked the verification badge thing while we've been on stream that's amazing hold
[2096.48 → 2102.40] on a second how do you just do that like you already told people like you're not worthy and
[2102.40 → 2108.96] you're like wait no it's cool you totally are don't worry about it uh okay hold on YouTube backtracks
[2108.96 → 2114.56] two hours ago this is great on taking badges away from creators after outcry okay so why don't we start
[2114.56 → 2122.80] at the beginning um YouTube is ticking off creators again um and i I had teased at the beginning of the
[2122.80 → 2130.80] stream no way that I actually know someone who had their um who had their eligibility for
[2130.80 → 2142.24] their verification badge stripped stripped stripped away none other than our very own yeah you're still
[2142.24 → 2150.08] there you go I'm good now I think so none other than our very own and dear Terran van helmet this
[2150.08 → 2161.68] is Tarzan van helmet's badge verification removal notification email notification there you go that
[2161.68 → 2169.12] was sent to him by messenger pigeon don't scroll it by YouTube don't scroll oh yeah no I won't
[2170.80 → 2176.24] informing him that they're updating the eligibility criteria for channel verification on YouTube
[2176.24 → 2182.24] unfortunately with these changes your channel no longer meets the criteria to be verified it used
[2182.24 → 2186.40] to be that anything over I think a hundred thousand subscribers could be verified we realize this
[2186.40 → 2190.72] might be disappointing, but we believe these updates will make channel verification more consistent
[2190.72 → 2195.44] for users and creators across YouTube please keep reading to learn more about the changes and what
[2195.44 → 2201.28] you can do what's changing YouTube will now proactively verify channels instead of accepting requests
[2201.28 → 2205.84] for verification badges we aim to verify channels that represent a well-known or highly searched creator
[2205.84 → 2209.44] artist public figure or company with the clear name to differentiate themselves from other channels
[2209.44 → 2217.20] with a similar name, and you basically are a nobody, so channels are typically verified if they have a large
[2217.20 → 2220.64] audience and community on YouTube are widely recognized outside YouTube or have a strong presence
[2220.64 → 2224.80] online or have a channel name that could be confused with other channels on YouTube the goal is to help
[2224.80 → 2229.68] channels avoid impersonation help viewers understand if the channel or the official presence is the
[2229.68 → 2234.40] official presence of the creator celebrity or brand that it represents it does not represent endorsements
[2234.40 → 2240.48] or awards from YouTube so what this means is you can go f yourself basically you're okay you can't
[2240.48 → 2244.80] appeal if you could appeal it that was a thing they offered I want to re-air some garbage here for a
[2244.80 → 2250.16] second I'm not verified on Twitter which I don't actually really care about I'm not verified that much I know
[2250.16 → 2255.76] yeah the thing that really pisses me off about it yes is there is an account do you know about this
[2255.76 → 2262.40] there's an account that has my exact name just one of the letters is alpha coded yeah and I don't know
[2262.40 → 2270.00] which one it is I don't remember so it looks just like me, it is a bot so it dynamically changes its cover
[2270.00 → 2276.72] photo and avatar photo to whatever I set mine to, and it copies every single tweet I make and then
[2276.72 → 2285.28] randomly inserts racist ones, and it follows everyone that I follow yeah so they get notifications saying this
[2285.28 → 2292.24] person just followed you, and then they check it out, and it's not me yeah luckily a non-insignificant
[2292.24 → 2298.40] amount of them have been like this doesn't seem right and have figured it out which is great but
[2298.40 → 2305.68] like what you're not a white supremacist I mean uh what fired frankly I'm disappointed
[2307.52 → 2311.76] I thought we had this thing you look like a white supremacist i just it's just so but like
[2311.76 → 2317.84] they I told twitter that, and they were like this is the whole reason why verification exists
[2317.84 → 2322.48] yeah, and it's important, and it should be used so we're not saying twitter's system is correct no
[2323.28 → 2328.08] um, but this isn't the right response probably isn't the right way to go about it ant venom lost his he
[2328.08 → 2332.16] has like over three million subscribers so basically they just determined he like
[2332.16 → 2339.76] like doesn't matter well they were like minecraft became less popular so screw you I guess you've
[2339.76 → 2346.80] had like toys in stores but nah I mean isn't minecraft popular again it is it's booming yet again I mean
[2346.80 → 2352.72] here I'm going to creep him just because I'm like curious and stuff this is like this is basically what
[2352.72 → 2359.92] we all do on the content creation side we just like creep each other on social blade so uh subscribers for
[2359.92 → 2367.44] the last 30 days he's growing yeah he's actually he's growing monthly gained video views' oh wow yeah
[2367.44 → 2371.84] he's growing because minecraft is because minecraft's back and I mean he made a video a long time ago
[2371.84 → 2376.00] being like why I'm still going to make minecraft videos, and he's just like i just really like minecraft
[2376.00 → 2380.64] so he's like the minecraft guy because a lot of people bailed on minecraft when it started becoming
[2380.64 → 2387.44] less popular, but he stuck around so yeah he's he like rode that out for like years still
[2387.44 → 2394.56] no I mean rode out that dip oh yeah there were a years long dip in minecraft popularity like he
[2395.20 → 2403.52] struggled yeah, but he's growing good on you, and then they took it away from him anyway um anyway uh
[2403.52 → 2411.12] they took away um lots of people twitter's just covered in it right now so basically okay so EPOS
[2411.12 → 2420.16] yeah basically what I think YouTube kind of missed here is that the verification tick is like um it's
[2420.16 → 2426.40] like a's badge of honour it's kind of like getting a 100 000 subscriber plaque or whatever
[2426.40 → 2435.36] else it's not necessarily from a creator standpoint it's not necessarily about um you know making I mean
[2435.36 → 2440.08] there is a practical component to it like Luke said with that Twitter bot that's yeah that spams like
[2440.08 → 2445.68] racist stuff yeah um, so there's a practical component to it, but there's also just like a
[2445.68 → 2454.24] pride component to it and there's really no reason to not verify someone because I think that the name
[2454.24 → 2462.56] of it is right in there verified that's all it is there's no reason to not verify a creator it doesn't
[2462.56 → 2469.28] say unless they aren't who they say they are it doesn't say endorsed by yeah it just says verified yes
[2469.28 → 2476.00] this is the actual ant venom or yes this is the actual taken van helmet so if you know you
[2476.00 → 2482.32] can be a bad person and have a passport yeah exactly like it's not it's not the country being like this
[2482.32 → 2492.56] person is fantastic I mean taken has 56 000 followers on Twitter which maybe isn't a big deal in 2019 from
[2492.56 → 2496.88] YouTube's perspective with their 2 billion unique users every month or whatever it is now
[2496.88 → 2507.28] um, but that's enough that literally thousands of people could be confused if there was a taken van
[2507.28 → 2514.32] helmet on YouTube, and it was not the same one as the taken van helmet on Twitter yeah and there was
[2514.32 → 2521.76] some kind of strangeness like oh this taken van helmet doesn't like macros what they hate macros it's so
[2521.76 → 2528.24] weird and like it's not it's not that hard either like it's the same it's the same tags and everything
[2528.24 → 2533.28] it says where he works well I'm sure people can spoof things you can buy followers and stuff it could
[2533.28 → 2542.00] be hard if they get it wrong I do see how them saying it's verified is kind of putting their seal of
[2542.00 → 2547.60] yes we verified it on it have you ever heard of that that's the other well I don't know just because i
[2547.60 → 2552.64] haven't heard of it doesn't mean it's not a problem it's true, so there was an unlisted channel that was
[2552.64 → 2560.96] buying um fake ads on YouTube uh promoting like an iPhone giveaway or something using my face in their
[2560.96 → 2566.96] thumbnail but because the channel and the videos were unlisted that the ad campaign was linked to
[2567.76 → 2573.60] it was not immediately obvious to YouTube's team that this was happening so it was only actually thanks
[2573.60 → 2578.80] to one of our very helpful users out there thank you who tweeted me a video ID that I could forward
[2578.80 → 2583.68] to them that I was able to find it and report it to them, they had the channel shut down and now
[2583.68 → 2589.36] they're going to find it well they couldn't find it because I didn't they couldn't use their content ID
[2589.36 → 2596.96] system to find your face on purchased advertisements on a thumbnail like just because they have like
[2596.96 → 2602.64] content ID and then like, but it was purchased ads, and it was just in the thumb and then like content
[2602.64 → 2609.68] analysis for like what type of content it is or like content classification for what type of user
[2609.68 → 2613.68] it might be good for these are all completely disconnected they only use you in the thumbnail
[2613.68 → 2617.92] and it was an app I didn't watch the video I was almost it was only sent to me but yes apparently they
[2617.92 → 2625.28] just used me in the thumbnail they used me holding up an iPhone as the thumbnail for like the uh the
[2625.28 → 2630.32] banner or something anyway the point is it was kind of difficult to track down unless they were actually
[2630.32 → 2635.84] served it and actually clicked it and got a video ID um so thanks to one of our users who brought that
[2635.84 → 2641.76] to my attention, and they're working on improving their systems i I just mean because nobody ever
[2641.76 → 2646.00] heard of something like that happening doesn't mean it wasn't a problem I don't fully see how that's
[2646.00 → 2651.84] related I just mean because you never heard I agree yeah the concept yeah I don't really understand
[2651.84 → 2656.72] how the story works in their oh well the story is just that here's the thing that happened that you
[2656.72 → 2661.52] wouldn't have heard about no one would have heard about so in much the same way there could have
[2661.52 → 2667.04] been a situation where YouTube verified someone by accident because they had a lot of subscribers
[2667.04 → 2673.68] and then that turned out to be spam or fake or like did the unlisted channel have a lot of subscribers
[2673.68 → 2679.52] what no, no that doesn't matter that's not the point is that something yeah I'm sure it could be
[2679.52 → 2683.76] because you could buy followers on like any platform sure yeah so just because you didn't hear about it
[2683.76 → 2688.88] doesn't mean it wasn't a problem and the point of my story was that YouTube will deal with weird edge
[2688.88 → 2694.96] cases that you wouldn't even think on their side the weird edge cases are happening all the time
[2694.96 → 2701.84] because yeah exactly so they might see a lot of weird edge cases around these verified badges that have
[2701.84 → 2708.24] caused enough problems that they went this isn't worth it can't deal with this anymore I think what
[2708.24 → 2715.04] they should maybe do in that case is just maybe increase the barrier to become verified not
[2715.04 → 2718.72] necessarily in terms of you need this many subs or whatever but like make the process just a little
[2718.72 → 2723.36] bit more difficult a little bit more involved but then don't make it impossible don't make it twitter
[2725.04 → 2729.76] or as far as I've heard it's like one person and as far as I can tell they're just super biased
[2731.20 → 2735.52] because they're like the accounts that get verified and the accounts that don't get verified are just
[2735.52 → 2743.20] I've seen verified accounts of just like absolute nobodies on like the local like morning news thing
[2743.20 → 2749.20] with like 3 000 followers I've seen once they're not yeah they're not trying to be a public figure
[2749.20 → 2753.60] at all yeah, and they have a verified badge I've had people send me ones where it's like they have
[2753.60 → 2760.64] like 40 followers which like that's totally fine but the point they're not trying to do anything
[2760.64 → 2770.40] yeah what who cares and if them why not these other people yeah I'm pretty sure I still don't have one
[2770.40 → 2777.92] on my personal twitter I don't think Linus tech does yeah and that took forever yeah that took a really
[2777.92 → 2783.20] long time yeah no yeah my personal one doesn't have it maybe they don't like my profile
[2783.20 → 2795.12] Linus cat tips now features uh editing so I heard i got adobe rush um because I have creative
[2795.12 → 2800.64] cloud anyway I might as well use at least one program in the entire suite so it's actually not
[2800.64 → 2806.32] bad and with the stylus on the note all of a sudden I have a reason to care about my stylus to be
[2806.32 → 2812.80] anything other than a selfie remote shutter um so that's fantastic that's cool it actually was pretty
[2812.80 → 2817.44] easy to do like just, just basic stuff just adding a title here and there and chopping up clips and
[2817.44 → 2822.72] stuff I have the most epic video that I'm going to be uploading on the cat tips channel in the next
[2822.72 → 2828.24] little bit maybe they won't like it because your name is still that very old very dead meme yeah i
[2828.24 → 2836.80] plan to keep it like that for quite some time Ivan's hilarious uh my wife she's so funny because she's
[2836.80 → 2842.48] always like why do you do these things why do you behave in this way because she was like isn't that kind
[2842.48 → 2849.44] of like past now I'm like yeah she's like shouldn't you change it like no, no she's like, but it's not
[2849.44 → 2855.52] funny I'm like yeah that's what's funny about it, she's like can you please just not I thought it's
[2855.52 → 2864.16] funny for a while can you just not like when when when Tim apple is long forgotten when that
[2864.16 → 2870.88] is when you know Trump is no longer president even when it's just completely dead that will still be
[2870.88 → 2876.48] my username and to the vast majority of people who've completely forgotten everything about it
[2877.20 → 2884.48] it'll just make no sense and like probably no one's going to mention it because like they don't want to
[2885.12 → 2890.00] they don't want to seem like maybe this is just something really new and I don't know about it yet
[2890.00 → 2895.76] yeah that's like my favorite my favorite kind of humour all right check this out check
[2895.76 → 2897.60] this out no one else gets to see this no
[2902.88 → 2903.84] what the heck
[2907.52 → 2913.04] that's really cute and i just really don't understand cats are so foreign to me cats are so ridiculous
[2913.04 → 2919.52] they're just like the dumbest animals ever um here's something to enjoy while I introduce our next topic
[2919.52 → 2924.80] um that one's going to go up probably after the other one all right what else we got here
[2927.68 → 2934.72] Facebook to create an independent oversight board uh so Facebook has unveiled its plan to create an
[2934.72 → 2940.40] independent oversight board to make decisions over how the network is moderated uh the panel will have
[2940.40 → 2946.40] the power to override decisions that Facebook makes over contentious material and influence new policy
[2946.40 → 2952.00] the panel will hear its first cases in 2020 and their decisions will be made public the idea dubbed
[2953.92 → 2955.76] the Facebook supreme court
[2958.32 → 2962.72] at this point should they just should, they just say should they just say it out right
[2963.92 → 2969.36] we're basically as influential as a country let's just become a country yeah um
[2970.16 → 2975.44] we'll eventually be composed of 40 people around the world, but we'll launch with 11 members and the names
[2975.44 → 2981.20] of those appointed will be made public uh experts have questioned this is great I love this the board's
[2981.20 → 2988.24] independence as well as the motivation behind this move um this is a great quote the only vote
[2988.24 → 2994.00] that really counts is the majority shareholder Mark Zuckerberg uh the board will be paid via a trust
[2994.00 → 3002.08] setup and funded by Facebook up front so Facebook is basically creating I mean this is government
[3002.08 → 3009.68] level stuff the government appointing its own ethics watchdog is exactly the same as Facebook appointing
[3009.68 → 3017.12] its own ethics watchdog having someone who can veto anyway yeah this is just great well I like it, i kind
[3017.12 → 3022.80] of think there's this whole massive game of chicken going on right now between the like what do you
[3022.80 → 3030.40] call them the fang am companies or something it's like Facebook apple Netflix google Microsoft
[3032.48 → 3039.36] Amazon yeah okay I said it slightly wrong fangum whatever um I think there's a giant game of chicken going on
[3039.84 → 3044.24] for the first one to buy a country for the first one just be like screw it
[3044.24 → 3053.12] this is this is Amazon land yeah this is Amazon the Amazon brought to you by Amazon yeah
[3055.28 → 3062.80] no it's not burning okay which everyone forgot about so here's a fun topic would you move to google's
[3062.80 → 3072.00] country I don't know because it would be interesting because it would be probably the first time when like
[3072.00 → 3079.84] citizenship acquiring citizenship somewhere would probably be a lot easier I actually doubt it
[3081.76 → 3087.60] I think acquiring citizenship would be more difficult because I've okayed you know this I've
[3087.60 → 3093.20] thought about this if I were to create a city yeah I still want you to make your city I've never aspired
[3093.20 → 3099.76] to a country if I were to make you should do it if I were to make a city I would be doing it to keep
[3099.76 → 3103.52] out idiots we've had this conversation where he has to tell me to shut up because I keep telling him
[3103.52 → 3112.00] to make a city I just think it'd be awesome but yeah no okay yeah yeah and I think but like with your
[3112.00 → 3118.16] thing you could probably like go take a test or like do something right there would be like an actionable
[3118.16 → 3127.12] item, and then you could probably get in if you passed yeah I think a lot of the kinds of so okay
[3127.12 → 3138.40] that's okay my point is my point is if I were them I wouldn't be creating a country to like
[3138.40 → 3144.88] make it easier no, no no okay so I might have phrased that incorrectly what I mean is instead of like
[3144.88 → 3150.32] waiting in a queue forever yeah or the current like America to Canada situation which is where like
[3150.32 → 3156.56] in a lot of situations you just can't yeah um there would be probably things that you could do
[3157.12 → 3163.20] or things that you could prove or whatever or what if there wasn't what if it was like verification
[3164.40 → 3171.92] what if there's one person just like they're super biased just like dialling the phone be like
[3171.92 → 3181.36] calling random people do you want a passport or or the Google method what if they were like
[3181.36 → 3189.52] come on in actually you know what piss off you actually get out wait you're mad you can stay
[3190.96 → 3196.72] yeah, yeah so oh you already sold all your stuff yeah yeah too bad
[3196.72 → 3207.52] okay so I want to show you something amazing um let me see if I can find the official form for it
[3207.52 → 3213.92] malta's hilarious if you just pay them like I'm pretty sure they have I think I've heard
[3213.92 → 3219.20] about this officially on their website somewhere like the country of Malta yeah Malta citizenship by
[3219.20 → 3222.48] investment program there it is yeah held on let me bring up your uh let me bring up but this
[3222.48 → 3228.48] isn't the actual this isn't the actual form anyway oh okay, but there's just a form but no it's like
[3228.48 → 3240.16] oh you uh you give us a hundred grand and here are some passports what it's amazing oh but I can't find
[3240.16 → 3248.48] and to be clear the point of this whole thing is it gives you EU citizenship so it has an impact on it's
[3248.48 → 3253.92] far more impactful than just having a Malta passport, so there's a difference between like I want to be
[3253.92 → 3261.20] a resident for a year and like I want to be and I want to be like forever z's so it sounds like one
[3261.20 → 3268.64] year uh 90 day visa free travel to all European countries um one year residency in Malta all that
[3268.64 → 3274.08] kind of stuff that's 24 000 euros but if you want like a passport, and you want to be like there I think
[3274.08 → 3281.20] it's main applicants are required to make a 650 000 euro contribution okay so that's a lot then i
[3281.20 → 3286.08] mean to me, I guess, but it's like there's people that's nothing to some other amount of money for
[3286.08 → 3292.48] all of your dependents or whatever, but you can just be like yeah whatever I'm an EU citizen yeah
[3292.48 → 3300.08] done yeah that's amazing um so like certain kind of versions of that kind of exist, but it's purely
[3300.08 → 3307.44] financial right now okay I'm going to play devil's advocate now with our whole um you know Facebook
[3307.44 → 3314.56] country okay here yeah what's the difference why would they want okay so yes you know the rules might
[3314.56 → 3319.04] be stupid, and you might not have the privacy that you value
[3322.24 → 3330.00] and the rules are already stupid you already don't have oh that's what no I know yeah so I think evil
[3330.00 → 3334.24] online's like vision of the future has been awkwardly accurate for a long time we're just
[3334.24 → 3339.60] everything's corporations, and you just like to apply to a different corporate you are always it is
[3339.60 → 3345.84] impossible to not be in a corporation in that game, and you just like to apply to other corporations to
[3345.84 → 3351.84] transfer over and your employment history is public to everyone for your entire lifespan like I think
[3352.48 → 3355.92] from the minute you are born you are employed by a corporation
[3355.92 → 3362.64] and then you just bounce around from there on okay this leads me to another great topic um on the
[3362.64 → 3371.68] subject of your family being a corporation okay I'm going to pitch you something um uh so you guys use Slack
[3371.68 → 3383.20] yeah you use um shoot JIRA yeah um we use Trello over here um, um we've also played around with uh monday.com
[3383.20 → 3387.92] um okay oh god their advertisements that's probably why I get bombed by them all the time because you
[3387.92 → 3393.84] guys sort of look into it yeah well actually we did a sponsored thing with them oh it's like every
[3393.84 → 3398.80] second ad on YouTube for me is monday.com yeah, so this is sort of uh the kind of thing that hopefully
[3398.80 → 3405.36] nobody ever sees even though it's on wan shows so basically we took everything we vetted it like
[3405.36 → 3410.88] we made sure that feature it was feature complete, and it's like very similar to Trello and then we
[3410.88 → 3415.92] decided okay we can endorse this it seems really great um so we did a piece and then we just
[3415.92 → 3423.36] substituted Monday for Trello in every way that we use Trello already, so the piece was very genuine
[3423.36 → 3427.92] in the sense that like yes that is exactly how we use our productivity enhancement tools as long as you
[3427.92 → 3432.64] guys verify, and we verified that all the same tools are there yeah yeah as long as you verified
[3432.64 → 3438.72] monday.com so we're like yeah okay sure um and that episode that we made the video about the six
[3438.72 → 3443.76] hours to air they did use monday.com so it's like okay everything we said was true which is great
[3443.76 → 3452.40] anyway um, so those tools there is a growing trend towards using those tools at home yes
[3454.16 → 3461.84] is that your answer do you i I want your answer first so is yes your answer like yes I want JIRA for
[3461.84 → 3468.40] my home I want my shopping list in JIRA not JIRA okay but Trello or Monday JIRA's too heavy for that
[3468.40 → 3475.68] but I already do you already do okay I freaking new it so i uh it hadn't even occurred to me until I was
[3475.68 → 3480.72] listening to some random podcast or reading an article I fell down like an internet black hole or
[3480.72 → 3486.56] something and like was clicking through things I was like huh so you create a create a homework
[3486.56 → 3493.28] checklist uh, or you create like a video games checklist of all the things that have to be done
[3493.28 → 3500.40] before you can play video games okay your kid uses their phone they submit I'd like a ticket effectively
[3500.40 → 3505.76] and you go sure you can say no, or you can say yes complete the homework checklist or the video
[3505.76 → 3510.16] game checklist and so is your room clean is your bed made are your teeth brushed you could build
[3510.16 → 3516.00] automation tools that once all the cards are out of the once they're all in the completed
[3516.00 → 3523.28] column it like unlocks the internet or yeah yeah yeah totally you could do that yep um so
[3523.28 → 3527.92] you support this notion because Yvonne is thinking of switching our family over to Trello
[3530.24 → 3537.76] shopping lists okay so I just use it personally no one else is on mine yeah mine is just for me okay
[3537.76 → 3544.24] and it's like kind of mess but I understand the mess sure like it would be unacceptable okay then fine i
[3544.24 → 3548.80] want the more complete answer would you consider moving your girlfriend and your parents onto Trello to
[3548.80 → 3549.52] interact with you
[3552.40 → 3555.36] um it would probably be really helpful
[3558.48 → 3562.64] I don't know I'm not necessarily against it family Trello boards and stuff like that
[3562.64 → 3566.72] i think the thing is you got to stay away from especially if you're bringing it to this
[3566.72 → 3572.64] is getting into my manager head but if you're bringing it to like a family front yeah unless you
[3572.64 → 3578.88] have like a family where every single person in the family is an engineer you should probably use one
[3578.88 → 3584.72] of the lightweight ones sure like the Mondays or the trellis out there I don't think you should use JIRA
[3585.28 → 3590.48] yeah just calm down JIRA's too much there's too much stuff going on it's very nice for what we do
[3591.12 → 3594.88] and like every time I've been like this is so annoying to work with because it is really freaking
[3594.88 → 3598.80] annoying to work with yeah I've been like okay we're going to switch to this other thing so I tried
[3598.80 → 3602.40] out myself for a little while and then I try to like to do the tasks that we're doing and I'm like no
[3603.12 → 3607.44] never mind we'll use JIRA but like yeah there's the right tool for the right job but I can see it
[3607.44 → 3614.16] making sense it's basically the old like what like pin board basically or the front of the fridge
[3614.16 → 3619.12] yep or whatever else yep just modernized and on everyone's phones absolutely yeah and so you just
[3619.12 → 3623.92] like double-sided tape a tablet to the front of your fridge I have an old iPad to that would run
[3623.92 → 3629.20] Trello just actually I don't know if the Trello app requires iOS 13 or 12 or whatever I'd have to
[3629.20 → 3632.88] check, but that would be awesome, so the shopping list is just like always there and everyone can
[3632.88 → 3640.56] update it from anywhere yeah yeah I think there's a value to it speaking of value lttstore.com now has
[3641.12 → 3647.04] a new shipping option oh what yeah, so this is exciting we've actually got uh I'm just going to bring it up i
[3647.04 → 3656.32] want those I know we're working on it um socks so lttstore.com stealth hoodie is in stock yeah
[3656.32 → 3661.92] uh the ram t-shirt has actually been super popular yeah um hard drive shirt and processor I think are
[3661.92 → 3666.16] the most popular items right now we've had perfect feedback about the lanyard do you have one of
[3666.16 → 3672.00] the lanyards they're very nice it's hard for me to give up my valve lanyard oh yeah okay fine you can
[3672.00 → 3678.24] you can wrap valves as long as you want it's very old and gnarly yeah they're kind of butt heads in
[3678.24 → 3684.48] some ways I'm surprised they ever even gave out a lanyard I guess is, but that's why I've kept it
[3684.48 → 3689.68] because like no one has them um but I didn't even think about the're kind of butt heads now you
[3689.68 → 3694.88] guys can't see this, but this is like super rugged they are I have mine on my desk because I'm waiting
[3694.88 → 3700.40] for this to fall in half again and then I'm going to replace it so basically uh we had we can offer FedEx
[3700.40 → 3706.16] shipping now in addition to ups and Canada post and the benefits of FedEx are not necessarily that
[3706.16 → 3711.68] you're going to like immediately get way better pricing across the board I know that some regions
[3711.68 → 3718.24] do not have great pricing where is my freaking teams here in some places there we go some of them are
[3718.24 → 3722.40] better than the other ones too and some people know that, but our rates should be at least marginally
[3722.40 → 3727.68] cheaper for Europe Asia and South America and the big thing is that the service should be much faster
[3727.68 → 3734.32] to those regions uh we have I had someone in Europe contact me earlier this week being like it has
[3734.32 → 3742.00] been six weeks when the hell is my order with Canada post I don't I don't understand what method of
[3742.00 → 3750.64] transportation can take weeks um I actually got some insight oh okay we'll come on around here so they
[3750.64 → 3759.68] can hear you come in the back um well phrasing so what they were telling me today is that oftentimes
[3759.68 → 3766.08] if let's say we're shipping something to Italy for example um it won't go from Richmond to Italy it'll
[3766.08 → 3772.08] go from Richmond to Germany, and then it'll get sorted in Germany and then go to the UK because like they
[3772.08 → 3776.88] ship in these huge bulks when they're going to Europe, and they don't do it like country by country
[3776.88 → 3781.92] necessarily and that's why it takes so long it'll only leave Germany or wherever once they
[3781.92 → 3788.24] have like a full truck or whatever oh that makes and also once it's been sorted and once it's been
[3788.24 → 3792.16] like cleared into the right sorted and processed and in that pile and then in that truck and then
[3792.16 → 3796.48] wait for that truck to be full and then probably not directly to Italy and then another big thing
[3796.48 → 3802.32] is um as far as I understand, and you know we haven't done full testing on this yet um but all FedEx
[3802.32 → 3806.72] shipments should be tracked oh so I know that's been sort of a frustration for some people so I'm
[3806.72 → 3811.44] really sorry, but we're we're working on it hopefully these should be much better especially
[3811.44 → 3817.60] for Europe customers the quoted like shipping times they have been like two to three business days to
[3817.60 → 3823.60] like Germany and I'm like I don't know if that's accurate but um hopefully it's better than five weeks
[3823.60 → 3826.56] so one of my friends just got a 3d printer from Shenzhen in two days
[3827.36 → 3832.08] free shipping that's insane was it like a 20 000 printer or something no
[3832.08 → 3838.08] oh no okay that that china subsidized international shipping man it's incredible
[3838.72 → 3846.80] yeah like you want to move to Hong Kong I'm kidding I mean honestly like not right now yeah
[3846.80 → 3851.28] the amount of stuff wrong place wrong time yeah not right now the amount of stuff that you can ship
[3851.28 → 3858.24] from Hong Kong for like you know 12 cents for like a physical package it's like what kind of nuts
[3858.24 → 3864.72] how does that make any sense you know what I mean uh anyway guys uh lttstore.com yeah helps us out a
[3864.72 → 3872.24] lot yeah and uh it's like good stuff yeah we're working on DHL yeah it's just not done yet yeah that'll
[3872.24 → 3880.88] be a lot of shipping options heck yeah yeah stuff all takes time um, and we're doing our best basically
[3880.88 → 3886.64] we're we're learning a lot uh you know doing this ourselves versus using a service like tee spring or
[3887.44 → 3892.80] district lines, or you know any of the ones that we used in the past has been a huge learning curve
[3892.80 → 3898.32] for us but I think it's I think it's worth it um do we have any other big topics that we wanted to
[3898.32 → 3907.76] talk about today uh oh actually this one's interesting uh so Huawei announced the mate 30 and the mate 30 pro
[3907.76 → 3913.52] in Munich this week and confirmed that the devices will not have any google apps no Google Maps no
[3913.52 → 3919.52] chrome no play store uh so mate 30 users will have to search the web using the Huawei browser and
[3919.52 → 3924.64] download apps using the Huawei app gallery which apparently has around 45 000 apps compared to the
[3924.64 → 3930.48] play store's estimated 2.7 million I mean I'm sure you could just side load things uh the mate 30 pro
[3931.28 → 3936.96] mate 30 phones will be powered by open source android but will run emu 10 Huawei's user interface that
[3936.96 → 3941.60] approximates google's android 10. That means why we will not will only be able to bring security
[3941.60 → 3947.52] updates to the mate 30 phones when those updates hit open source android um I mean they've never
[3947.52 → 3951.52] really been the fastest at security updates anyway so that probably won't be very different
[3951.52 → 3957.76] um yeah there's no way that I would even consider like it would even begin to consider buying an android
[3957.76 → 3964.32] phone that is not mainline android good luck remember that stupid watch how much it took me to
[3964.32 → 3970.08] get the play store on that stupid watch yeah oh yeah the what was it called that stupid kick
[3970.08 → 3975.60] started kick farted thing yeah yeah I don't remember the name of it what was it called
[3977.20 → 3982.80] my brain's telling me it has something to do with a tree on the tip of my tongue why can I not remember
[3982.80 → 3993.68] uh i typed that I like typed both of them kick farted playlist motion activated battery bank no that's
[3993.68 → 4000.64] the one wrist mounted smartphone neptune pine that's why I thought tree Neptune pine and I said
[4000.64 → 4007.36] that before it came up you did I won you did go Linus uh but yeah i I was able to side load the whole
[4007.36 → 4012.88] play store onto that thing I don't know how viable side loading the entire play store is these days
[4012.88 → 4016.80] but you can probably side load the individual it's like a bad experience for anyone other than a great
[4016.80 → 4022.08] big nerd it was terrible yeah um all right we've got a couple other little things rock star has a
[4022.08 → 4027.68] games launcher oh boy and like they already require you to use it if you want to play the game sweet
[4027.68 → 4038.72] um and the core i9 10 900x what a stupid name um appears on geek bench 4 someone has seemingly
[4038.72 → 4047.60] benchmarked it the unreleased processor sports the 10 000 series branding ah um so it's most likely one
[4047.60 → 4053.84] of intel's upcoming heat parts based on their cascade lake micro architecture uh the rumoured base clock and
[4053.84 → 4060.72] boost clock are four gigahertz and 4.6 gigahertz and intel claims that cascade lake x will bring
[4060.72 → 4064.88] double the performance per dollar so we might be getting some price drops scheduled to arrive next
[4064.88 → 4072.56] month and I guess that's pretty much it other than why is it called that some super chats oh one thing
[4072.56 → 4079.68] about the Rockstar Games launcher is in my opinion this is probably yeah okay so it's even in the notes
[4079.68 → 4086.00] this launch could be in preparation for a pc version of Red Dead Redemption 2 and all of its various
[4086.00 → 4092.00] potential microtransactions Bryant lewis says when is scrapyard wars dropping and do any people of colour
[4092.00 → 4098.96] apply and get hired at leg um so your first question I can answer that one pretty easily uh we are shooting
[4098.96 → 4106.32] scrapyard wars in two weeks which means that the episodes will come when they come as for whether any
[4106.32 → 4112.80] people of colour apply and get hired at leg the last time I checked um we have lots of people who are
[4112.80 → 4118.40] not white and as far as I know anything other than white is a colour so I guess half of the founding
[4118.40 → 4127.60] members there's I guess there's that we're not white um also just saying as for more than half if you
[4127.60 → 4133.04] count Yvonne of the family were you counting Brandon I wasn't counting Brandon oh okay, okay Brandon's tech
[4133.04 → 4138.72] okay, okay what was he like week two well no okay so Brandon's complicated because we didn't hire him
[4138.72 → 4146.56] until I think April or may okay, but he actually volunteered for us on our first project which we
[4146.56 → 4152.88] completed it was a sponsored thing for corsair before the company formally started okay so he had
[4152.88 → 4160.08] I didn't know that for us okay before we ever paid him and before the company officially began on January
[4160.08 → 4164.00] first we didn't really have the money we did not have any money yeah yeah we had okay so I will
[4164.00 → 4169.12] count that I didn't know I forgot that part so that's why Brandon is technically OG even though
[4169.12 → 4174.64] he actually that makes sense that makes sense but at the same time yeah, so then yeah majority was not
[4174.64 → 4184.00] white yeah so um as for our hiring practices we hire the most qualified candidate and isn't the majority
[4184.00 → 4192.80] still not white um I'm not sure honestly I don't give a shit it's not the point yeah I don't know
[4192.80 → 4199.84] either because it doesn't matter yeah um when people apply you know depending on what we're trying to do
[4200.40 → 4207.20] we hire whoever the person who seems like they can do it the best is yeah and speaking of which uh I don't
[4207.20 → 4211.60] know if I'm going to be able to find it in time for it to be relevant but uh Brandon appreciation day passed
[4211.60 → 4218.72] and I recognized that I was the only person who engaged in appreciating Brandon on that day and
[4218.72 → 4223.76] I'm disappointed in the community so you guys should step up Lord yeah um
[4227.36 → 4233.20] all right oh wow Steve a say please do a comparison with CRT and fixed pixel displays
[4233.20 → 4237.44] I've heard that the moving resolution and fixed pixel displays falls apart compared to CRT there was a
[4237.44 → 4242.64] there was an article that went up I think i digital foundry did a video digital foundry did a video
[4242.64 → 4250.00] and everyone on the planet is trying to come across like they came up with this out of nowhere
[4250.80 → 4256.96] and it's driving me nuts yeah like okay i I don't I'm not certain that digital foundry was the first
[4256.96 → 4262.24] I am not sure either I don't know where exactly this came from but whatever happened there what's up
[4262.24 → 4269.36] are you guys on you're not oh we're almost done you're still live we're still live yeah
[4269.36 → 4275.76] don't let me interrupt you okay thanks fella yeah but like the amount of tweets has gone I was thinking
[4275.76 → 4282.16] today yeah I think it would be so interesting if you were your now were you no you were not thinking
[4282.16 → 4287.60] about CRT monitors today you just watched a video and are trying to pass the idea on to us so CRTs
[4287.60 → 4293.92] absolutely have a value and there are things that they do better than any modern display technology
[4293.92 → 4299.68] there's a reason that our arcade machine has a CRT there's a reason that we have both a CRT TV and a
[4299.68 → 4304.88] CRT monitor over in the warehouse in case we happen to need one for a project yeah, but there are lots
[4304.88 → 4310.16] of things that they don't do better and while they may have better motion resolution particularly for
[4310.16 → 4317.84] certain types of content they also flicker and I'm talking even at high refresh rates they flicker
[4317.84 → 4325.20] the eye fatigue like I don't miss that um so yeah no way in hell I would replace my daily driver monitors
[4325.20 → 4332.00] with a CRT as not going to happen as like a fun thing to play some Super Mario world yeah you've done it
[4332.00 → 4340.40] yes um yeah it's better yeah but like get real it's also very immersive are not coming back no
[4341.20 → 4348.88] like getting that Sony one and messing around with I said they sell for way too much they sell for
[4348.88 → 4353.12] insane amounts of money but getting one of those and messing around would be fun there's no way I would
[4353.12 → 4358.64] replace my setup with it and I think it weighs like a hundred pounds or something come on Kepler the
[4358.64 → 4362.96] title is real it was just earlier in the stream it was the first topic that we did uh we are almost
[4362.96 → 4367.12] at the end of the stream now yeah all right uh i hope digital foundry keeps making videos
[4367.12 → 4372.16] about it because it's very interesting to watch but I don't Jesse says uh speaking of UFC do either of
[4372.16 → 4381.44] you watch it every once in a while uh nick has events, and he invites me and I go and that's about it and
[4381.44 → 4388.48] I just go to socialize I am super not into it, I've always had far more appreciation for finesse based
[4388.88 → 4394.16] athleticism than I do for brute force based athleticism with that said I was watching a
[4394.16 → 4399.28] trailer for some UFC event that maybe has passed now but was coming up at some point and I don't
[4399.28 → 4404.72] know who it was, but he looked like he's probably like a lightweight or middleweight fighter who is
[4404.72 → 4410.72] phenomenally acrobatic that was pretty cool I guess I used to really like watching GSP I'm really
[4410.72 → 4418.64] really not into watching people get brain-damaged um yeah and i you know UFC has benefits over
[4418.64 → 4423.84] more traditional sports like boxing in that regard because the fact that you don't have gigantic pads
[4423.84 → 4430.00] on your fists means that your brain isn't getting shaken around quite so much, but it's just not
[4430.00 → 4433.68] something that I personally derive pleasure from and I don't really enjoy watching bare knuckle to the
[4433.68 → 4440.32] head is like terrible for brain damage yes but compared to bouncy bounce 40 hits from oh no yeah yeah
[4440.32 → 4446.08] yeah okay, okay I see where you're going with it yeah it's yeah yeah yeah watching GSP was really
[4446.08 → 4450.24] interesting because he was extremely technically good, and he would just like dismantle people that
[4450.24 → 4455.44] was really cool uh johnny winter says Linus last year you talked about some vessel to put between
[4455.44 → 4459.28] monitors so it made the monitors flow together what happened to that Asus actually like tweeted about
[4459.28 → 4464.88] that recently I think that project is not actually dead oh wow Lucas says getting jerked around by racer
[4464.88 → 4470.56] support after two dead new laptops in two years I know you all had a lot of failures to any contacts
[4470.56 → 4476.64] that you can share unfortunately the only contact I have there is my media contact I don't have any
[4476.64 → 4482.88] special sales or support contact um you can link them to me saying I'm very disappointed in them right
[4482.88 → 4488.08] now but that's really the best that I can do for you, I'm not surprised either I can tell you that I do
[4488.08 → 4493.84] have a video coming on probably not switching or not sticking with the razor blade stealth that I selected
[4493.84 → 4501.44] recently, so there's that nice uh Rohit says please do a tech wiki on shunt modding and its benefit
[4503.28 → 4503.92] sorry what
[4506.80 → 4515.12] shunt modding first hit do not shunt mod your graphics card in all capital letters from lewis Roman with
[4515.12 → 4523.28] liquid metal oh well that would be stupid okay uh neat oh this okay
[4524.16 → 4529.28] so okay you're just you're just shorting out connections on the graphics card PCB in order to
[4529.28 → 4535.52] get more voltage out of it um yeah that'd be kind of cool it's pretty niche though yeah
[4537.12 → 4543.36] yeah I'll consider it uh Jesse says is your trademark ratchet driver a snap-on yes it is
[4543.36 → 4551.04] uh I have a pink one for you, I own a pink one already um yeah it's uh it's my wife's actually
[4551.04 → 4560.48] uh Dimitri says flow plane or float plane float like not sink uh Ben says please talk
[4560.48 → 4566.72] about folding month 2019. I think that was even in here oh wait I think we talked about it on a
[4566.72 → 4571.68] previous wine show didn't we I thought that happened a few months back oh here we go uh there are some
[4571.68 → 4575.92] prizes that we're going to be giving away as well as some that the community has donated you can check it
[4575.92 → 4583.12] out on the LTT official folding month 2019 thread over on the forum I will go ahead and drop that in
[4583.12 → 4589.92] the I will not drop that in the chat I don't have the chat open uh that'll take me a minute but yes
[4589.92 → 4595.60] shout out to folding month 2019. yeah, it's very active there are posts in that thread as of like now so
[4596.24 → 4603.60] uh Burnley says I am financially stupid so here's some money nice it's my birthday next month I want some
[4603.60 → 4608.72] LTT merch what would you recommend for my first purchase um if you are looking for
[4610.64 → 4617.12] oh hold on a second I really want to just oh man the sweater is like really nicely durable
[4618.00 → 4621.60] I mean all of it's really nicely durable but I feel like that sweater is going to hold up for a
[4621.60 → 4625.76] really long time stealth hoodie is great water bottle is great um the underwear are awesome but
[4625.76 → 4630.00] they're really expensive so it's kind of it kind of depends on your budget stealth hoodie is a really
[4630.00 → 4634.64] good place to start stealth hoodie and like an elemental shirt or something like that
[4634.64 → 4639.28] I know they're not there now, but they'll be back we're kind of considering bringing back elemental on
[4639.28 → 4644.24] an ongoing basis as something that we can just like to beat the crap out of every once in a while
[4645.76 → 4651.04] it's just like yeah no one likes it, but it's a good deal sure we probably won't do that yeah that's
[4651.04 → 4656.24] probably not the best um Noah says is float plane working on separation of Ltd tech quick and tech
[4656.24 → 4661.44] link but under one subscription um so no they will be separate subscriptions at some point when I'm
[4661.44 → 4669.44] not lazy uh Bubba Bubba Bubba death 812 says hope you don't mind hillbilly humour for the content
[4669.44 → 4674.72] contest you announced yesterday oh we don't mind hillbilly humour uh Robert says can I resell my red hat
[4674.72 → 4680.72] license with these new challenges then no, no they're only they're only challenging steam right now they
[4680.72 → 4685.12] said they have the plan to challenge other things but I doubt they're going to go after that
[4685.76 → 4690.64] uh Tommy gun says hey Linus you should really visit the developer of Anna they're located in my hometown
[4690.64 → 4696.00] uh by the way it's late around here yeah because you're in Germany all right then Robert says when
[4696.00 → 4700.88] is the AMD epic video coming very soon and there will be more than just one uh Robert says remember
[4700.88 → 4706.80] Area 51 you hear about the YouTubers that got arrested no yeah they went in the day before and they
[4706.80 → 4710.48] got all their electronics so their camera equipment lights and a drone confiscated
[4710.48 → 4716.32] like for good they got uh fined 2200 each they actually got sentenced to a year in jail
[4716.32 → 4720.56] but they're foreign nationals so I think they worked at a deal where they could pay 2200 spend
[4720.56 → 4725.36] three days in jail and then I'm guessing they're never getting let into the U.S. again the hell back
[4725.36 → 4730.96] out yeah they're foreign nationals why would you do that because no the memes I guess but like
[4731.52 → 4736.48] something that's always broken like broken my brain do not break the law in a different country
[4736.48 → 4743.20] like the people that go to like uh North Korea and like steal posters but what are you doing
[4744.64 → 4750.72] what are you doing I get it you're an activist that's great find other ways but like there's
[4750.72 → 4754.72] people that like it's a terrible idea I don't know how they get them there, but there's people that
[4754.72 → 4763.28] get uses filled with like North American European stuff into North Korea do that buy a bunch of
[4763.28 → 4768.56] uses donate them to that yeah group that does that I don't know much about it but yeah their
[4768.56 → 4773.44] posters are hilarious they'll go to different events, and they just have like Kim Jong-un faces and you
[4773.44 → 4778.96] plug the USB into his mouth, and then they just like, and it just looks stupid, and then they collect all
[4778.96 → 4782.96] the uses at the end of the day and wipe them all and fill them with information and send them north
[4782.96 → 4791.12] Korea really it's pretty interesting actually they have them at um like different conventions yeah i
[4791.12 → 4798.00] don't know uh okay gaming have you taken a look at Gog we actually did a collab with Gog that we shot
[4798.00 → 4804.24] this week do you know about this uh I've heard vaguely we made the best gaming console as a pc so we
[4804.24 → 4810.24] built like a console sized pretty powerful computer okay um, and we worked with Gog because really the
[4810.24 → 4815.36] the point we're trying to make is that one of the big benefits of the pc is the library yeah and Gog
[4815.36 → 4822.80] is such a great example of how deep and affordable the pc gaming library is and so uh Gog generously
[4822.80 → 4829.76] contributed their 500 top-selling games which was apparently a ton of work for them because they
[4829.76 → 4836.24] actually had to reach out to every developer to get the okay for this they gave them all to us to
[4836.24 → 4842.24] load onto this pc, and we're going to give away the pc uh at the end of the video yeah so uh pretty sweet
[4842.24 → 4847.36] Gog good one thing that I really like about Gog is it's a platform that you can support that's a
[4847.36 → 4853.92] gaming platform that you don't have to feel at least marginally weird about uh so rowan says that
[4853.92 → 4858.24] reselling games could be a positive for valve if they allow the sale through their marketplace allowing
[4858.24 → 4862.72] them to double-dip into the sale of the game they could also give some to the developer yeah that's
[4862.72 → 4867.20] probably where we're going to end up realistically gaming trouble says make sure you look at the cube
[4867.20 → 4876.72] world release for steam it's so big news I don't know what cube world is um
[4878.80 → 4883.84] captain pepper says I love my HDD and ram shirts, but my fave is the tech-linked masking tape shirt such a
[4883.84 → 4887.92] great story behind it any more limited edition products coming I mean those will only happen when they
[4887.92 → 4891.76] like when inspiration strikes we're not going to force it I don't think we should actually do it
[4891.76 → 4896.96] but someone mentioned the other day that we should do the green masking or green painters tape FPM logo
[4897.68 → 4903.76] as a shirt if you guys want to take on the burden of that inventory go for it, we don't have anywhere to
[4903.76 → 4914.16] put it we don't have any inventory space okay let me see yeah uh Steven says first super chat ever
[4914.16 → 4918.32] you guys rock please send support to UFD tech yeah we talked about that oh wow these were a while ago
[4918.96 → 4923.92] uh oh boy hey guys what phone can you recommend to someone who's off contract and paying for their
[4923.92 → 4928.80] device up front would like to shy away from financing uh really wow it really depends on your budget
[4928.80 → 4934.64] I mean Samsung's a series is pretty good, but they're still like pretty expensive um
[4936.88 → 4940.32] anything from OnePlus is good, but they're not that cheap anymore so that's tough
[4940.32 → 4946.80] poco phone f1 you can get your hands on one of those if it's got good band support in your area
[4946.80 → 4952.96] um it's still a very decent phone especially with the Google camera mod uh kyle Andrews hey guys
[4952.96 → 4958.56] what phone can you recommend someone who's off oh whoops Jacob name another product you can buy
[4958.56 → 4966.72] and not resell in the world uh sure uh a thermal camera I'm serious yeah yeah you have to sign a
[4966.72 → 4970.56] whole thing that says you're like not a terrorist, and it needs to stay in your possession and blah
[4970.56 → 4978.16] blah blah blah blah blah because it could be used for military applications uh digital movies um sure
[4978.16 → 4984.16] yeah but no they meant like that's the same thing effectively it's not a game okay that's true
[4984.72 → 4989.36] digital things are in their own category underwear I mean you can resell it but like
[4989.36 → 4996.56] it's like for all intents and purposes it's not it's consumable um living says how often do you
[4996.56 → 5002.88] run on raid parody checks um whenever they automatically run I mean they don't really uh
[5003.44 → 5007.12] just like fall out of parody I think he's wondering if you have like a schedule set up or
[5007.12 → 5010.88] something uh yeah it's included with unpaid I think it's set to run every month by default
[5011.44 → 5013.84] but that I think that's what he oh once a month
[5013.84 → 5020.80] um yes sir how would you feel about having physical games on flash drives too expensive
[5021.36 → 5028.32] can't be done uh Tommy gun to be mean many years we were told that digital distribution is all about
[5028.32 → 5035.52] anti-piracy and not about reselling so what would be the issue nah there's more to it than that uh
[5035.52 → 5038.56] Charlie says please bring back the LAN hoodie not happening
[5038.56 → 5041.52] oh
[5046.64 → 5052.64] interesting uh we actually are planning a video bobby on the lgc9 after the g-sync update
[5052.64 → 5056.96] apparently a pc connected to HDMI only does two channel PCM right now
[5057.60 → 5063.68] uh big deal if you use arc to a receiver why would you use arc to a receiver though why wouldn't you just
[5063.68 → 5069.92] go through your receiver it doesn't do does it do g-sync over HDMI how the hell does that work
[5069.92 → 5073.84] i actually I saw the I saw the headline but I wasn't sure how they were doing it oh interesting
[5073.84 → 5078.56] so it's funny that you bring that up because I have a video coming on Asus's BFD and I'm having
[5078.56 → 5085.52] a similar issue how do I get audio how do I get high resolution audio or excuse me high definition audio
[5085.52 → 5091.44] to uh like a surround or like a multichannel speaker setup because you're going DisplayPort from
[5091.44 → 5098.00] the computer to the display and then what optical audio is dead and buried like it
[5098.00 → 5107.68] doesn't do high definition audio so um all right get this HDMI out separately to the receiver oh god
[5108.48 → 5115.60] shut up and then duplicating my display and then I found this weird app on like
[5115.60 → 5122.16] GitHub or something that uh allows you to lock your mouse to your primary display
[5122.96 → 5129.60] so you're effectively running a phantom cloned display that did seem to be getting multichannel audio
[5130.40 → 5135.68] whoa I didn't fully know how you were going to get there but the second you said the additional
[5135.68 → 5140.40] cable it's just like oh no I know exactly what the destination is I'm not sure how the journey's
[5140.40 → 5145.60] going to come together uh we're not bringing back the wan hoodie anytime soon is it even like feasible
[5145.60 → 5156.64] to do that no yeah I didn't think so I think that's done uh Bruce says uh love you and your

[5257.04 → 5263.92] fee on delivery um yeah probably but I think that might just be taxes and import duty and I'm pretty
[5263.92 → 5269.52] sure you're going to get nailed with that regardless especially if you're in like a vat country um
[5270.24 → 5275.12] oh my goodness there are so many super chats today please guys do not send any more

[5311.52 → 5316.72] a while ago that was ages ago it's like three years ago years many years um it ended up being
[5316.72 → 5321.52] very complicated do you remember why it was complicated uh they didn't want us to do it or
[5321.52 → 5325.52] something didn't they I don't remember no I don't think because we were no, but we were going to be
[5325.52 → 5331.52] uh no it's against their terms though yeah I don't think that was why we didn't do it we were
[5331.52 → 5335.84] concerned for that reason maybe nick was concerned I didn't care I'm pretty sure nick was quite
[5335.84 → 5344.16] concerned all right then yeah um okay Vincent says badminton merch when uh no time soon
