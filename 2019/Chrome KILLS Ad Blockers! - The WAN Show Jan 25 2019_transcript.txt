[0.88 --> 3.26]  I thought we were so on time. We're not.
[3.52 --> 5.32]  Yeah, we're not quite on time.
[5.44 --> 9.10]  We're closer than we have been for the last, like, three weeks.
[9.20 --> 10.72]  Because we've been, like, half an hour off.
[10.98 --> 12.24]  Yes, we have been.
[12.72 --> 15.12]  Okay, in my defense this week...
[15.12 --> 16.26]  You came from a different country.
[16.44 --> 19.02]  I was in France for three days.
[19.20 --> 22.84]  And I am jet-legged as hell.
[23.14 --> 26.14]  So I had a brilliant idea on this trip.
[26.14 --> 27.00]  I was like, hmm.
[27.92 --> 29.86]  I'm flying out for France.
[30.00 --> 33.20]  On Sunday afternoon.
[33.38 --> 35.78]  So, like, a 1 p.m. flight.
[36.36 --> 40.02]  It's about, I don't know, a nine-and-a-half-hour flight or something like that.
[40.06 --> 42.90]  It's like nine-and-a-half hours there, 11 hours back or something like that.
[43.24 --> 44.94]  So I'm flying out for nine hours.
[45.02 --> 49.26]  So that'll make it nighttime home when I get there.
[49.46 --> 52.34]  But it'll be about 8 a.m. France time.
[53.46 --> 59.52]  So I only have one day where I have any kind of work obligation to our sponsor.
[59.52 --> 61.20]  So here's what I'm going to do.
[61.48 --> 63.14]  I'm going to land in the morning.
[63.54 --> 65.16]  See if I can get early check-in.
[65.58 --> 68.60]  I'm going to sleep away the entire day.
[68.60 --> 71.88]  I'm going to stay up all night.
[71.88 --> 84.00]  And then I'm going to pull, effectively, an all-nighter to stay up the day of France time and then go to sleep in, like, the morning of home time.
[84.00 --> 93.28]  And then pull, like, another all-nighter, effectively doing two nights of sleep over three days and stay awake on the whole flight home.
[93.48 --> 97.38]  And then collapse in my bed around four hours after my flight lands.
[97.46 --> 103.08]  So I did manage to get as far as collapsing in my bed when I got home.
[103.08 --> 108.70]  But even the nine and a half hour sleep that I got was not enough to recover.
[109.28 --> 118.98]  And while I was on this trip, don't tell our sponsor, but during the keynote, I passed the crap up.
[120.76 --> 121.56]  Really?
[123.94 --> 127.20]  They fly you across the world.
[128.26 --> 130.30]  You fall asleep.
[130.30 --> 133.60]  Oh, my God.
[133.88 --> 134.14]  Okay.
[134.46 --> 134.80]  Okay.
[135.18 --> 138.46]  I have a few things to say.
[138.46 --> 139.70]  Are you, like, in the front?
[140.86 --> 141.34]  No.
[141.60 --> 142.00]  Okay.
[142.16 --> 144.72]  But I'm in the front of the next section.
[144.88 --> 145.70]  Oh, boy.
[145.72 --> 147.70]  There was a fair bit of foot traffic past me.
[147.78 --> 148.04]  Look.
[148.04 --> 148.48]  Look.
[148.60 --> 149.40]  No one noticed.
[149.54 --> 150.60]  Colton propped me up.
[152.70 --> 153.74]  Oh, my God.
[153.76 --> 154.80]  He had his own problems.
[154.96 --> 156.92]  He, like, threw up so many times.
[157.12 --> 159.64]  He had a bad McBaggle or something.
[159.64 --> 160.10]  I think.
[160.18 --> 163.14]  I'm not sure what it was, so I'm not actually blaming McDonald's.
[163.44 --> 163.80]  Okay.
[164.00 --> 165.58]  But that McBaggle didn't look good.
[165.76 --> 169.68]  Anyway, I'm not actually blaming McDonald's, but the McBaggle over there looks disgusting.
[169.84 --> 169.98]  Sorry.
[170.04 --> 171.50]  I'm not actually blaming McDonald's.
[172.36 --> 173.42]  They have a McBaggle?
[173.54 --> 174.26]  Do we have a McBaggle?
[174.26 --> 174.66]  No, no.
[174.70 --> 178.38]  They actually apparently test a lot of stuff in France because French people apparently
[178.38 --> 179.44]  eat a lot of McDonald's.
[180.08 --> 183.22]  I mean, they're known for, like, their, like, haute cuisine food culture.
[183.40 --> 185.64]  And yet McDonald's, Chez McDo, apparently a big deal.
[186.02 --> 186.28]  Okay.
[186.50 --> 188.68]  Anyway, where was I going with this?
[188.68 --> 188.86]  Okay.
[188.86 --> 189.22]  Okay.
[189.22 --> 189.42]  No.
[189.64 --> 190.02]  Shut up.
[190.18 --> 196.50]  In my defense, okay, the things that I was actually there for was to live stream during
[196.50 --> 198.66]  the event, which we told them wasn't going to work.
[198.86 --> 199.16]  Okay.
[199.22 --> 199.84]  And it didn't.
[200.02 --> 200.16]  Okay.
[200.16 --> 204.64]  They were like, no, we're going to have, like, your own Wi-Fi and it'll be fine.
[204.68 --> 209.04]  And I was like, that's not going to help, but we're going to humor you.
[209.12 --> 211.52]  And it cut out, like, five times in 20 minutes.
[211.56 --> 211.72]  Yeah.
[211.72 --> 213.56]  And we were like, we're done now.
[214.22 --> 219.72]  And then I was also there to participate in, like, a photo challenge slash fan meetup in
[219.72 --> 220.08]  Paris.
[220.58 --> 220.94]  Right.
[220.98 --> 221.66]  And I saw that part.
[221.68 --> 221.82]  Yeah.
[221.96 --> 223.26]  And you stayed awake for that.
[223.30 --> 223.42]  Yeah.
[223.50 --> 223.82]  I was.
[225.60 --> 226.00]  Okay.
[226.00 --> 230.18]  We actually had a wonderful lunch with some of our amazing French fans.
[230.32 --> 230.58]  Okay.
[230.78 --> 232.42]  Actually, it was awesome.
[232.90 --> 236.24]  Because we were supposed to eat at the same restaurant as everyone else, but then there
[236.24 --> 237.64]  weren't enough seats for our fans.
[237.64 --> 242.64]  So we were like, well, I think we're going to have to just peace and we're going to go
[242.64 --> 243.20]  somewhere else.
[243.66 --> 249.00]  And one of the guys who, it's going to be a total inside joke, but I'm going to refer
[249.00 --> 250.68]  to him as French Alex P.
[251.66 --> 252.06]  Okay.
[252.32 --> 252.54]  Yeah.
[253.90 --> 256.04]  He picked this amazing restaurant.
[256.46 --> 258.14]  Like, more French Alex P?
[258.20 --> 258.44]  Yes.
[258.70 --> 258.96]  Okay.
[259.34 --> 259.50]  Okay.
[259.64 --> 260.46]  French or Alex P?
[260.46 --> 260.62]  Yeah.
[260.66 --> 263.32]  Well, no, because he's Canadian French.
[263.48 --> 264.92]  That's different than French French.
[265.02 --> 265.10]  Yeah.
[265.54 --> 265.68]  Yeah.
[265.68 --> 266.60]  Is it not different?
[266.74 --> 267.56]  It's illegitimate French.
[267.64 --> 268.54]  He says it's different.
[268.68 --> 268.82]  See?
[269.28 --> 269.40]  Yeah.
[269.64 --> 272.04]  So I'm going to describe him as French Alex P.
[272.44 --> 273.14]  AJ and Willard.
[273.30 --> 273.96]  What can I help you with that thing?
[274.54 --> 274.84]  What are you?
[274.84 --> 275.48]  I was trying to fix it.
[275.50 --> 276.04]  Oh, okay.
[276.46 --> 279.20]  So anyway, he picks this amazing restaurant.
[279.42 --> 284.58]  I have the most amazing steak, the most amazing dessert, like the most amazing bread.
[284.68 --> 285.74]  Just everything's amazing.
[286.00 --> 287.10]  We had an amazing lunch.
[287.56 --> 288.46]  It was awesome.
[288.80 --> 290.08]  And then our sponsor paid for it.
[290.50 --> 293.22]  Do you have a, for people in France, France.
[293.64 --> 294.08]  France.
[294.20 --> 294.64]  What is it?
[294.68 --> 295.12]  Where was it?
[295.88 --> 296.44]  Oh, I don't remember.
[296.52 --> 296.86]  Oh, okay.
[296.86 --> 297.12]  Yeah.
[297.16 --> 297.36]  Sorry.
[297.46 --> 298.58]  I'm not good at these things.
[298.84 --> 299.72]  But it was awesome.
[300.12 --> 300.28]  Cool.
[300.34 --> 300.66]  It was awesome.
[300.78 --> 303.04]  You can never experience it because I can't tell you how to do that.
[303.14 --> 304.22]  But like, it was awesome.
[304.38 --> 304.80]  But it was great.
[304.94 --> 309.14]  We just like hung out, just like broed out for, I shouldn't say broed out.
[309.22 --> 310.26]  We actually had a mix.
[310.92 --> 311.96]  There was a lady there.
[311.96 --> 312.96]  Heck yeah.
[312.96 --> 316.40]  So we hung out for like 90 minutes or something like that.
[316.46 --> 317.68]  Had a really nice relaxing lunch.
[317.74 --> 318.84]  Then we went over to the keynote.
[319.72 --> 323.58]  And the other thing, okay, so the other thing is the sponsor, the other sponsor obligation
[323.58 --> 327.00]  was that we had a video that went up around the time of the keynote.
[327.16 --> 327.30]  Yeah.
[327.30 --> 331.76]  Except that we had pre-recorded that because they're super smart, like OnePlus, and they
[331.76 --> 333.04]  just sent us, it's honor.
[333.26 --> 337.38]  So they just sent us the thing ahead of time so we could record it before we got there,
[337.46 --> 338.58]  which is like brilliant.
[338.72 --> 340.62]  So while we were over there, it was supposed to be pretty chill.
[341.04 --> 342.46]  Now I chilled out a little hard.
[342.46 --> 348.46]  I don't think they were expecting me to pass out in the audience, but again, in my defense,
[348.54 --> 349.24]  it was pretty long.
[349.62 --> 350.02]  Okay.
[350.42 --> 352.16]  And I was very, very tired.
[354.02 --> 354.90]  So dumb.
[356.10 --> 361.46]  And Colton's just like, he's like, yeah, okay, so here's the things we've like still got to
[361.46 --> 361.64]  do.
[361.72 --> 363.32]  And we got to get, we got to get you out of here, man.
[363.34 --> 364.98]  Cause you were like not looking good.
[365.96 --> 371.88]  Like I get to this point of tired where I actually get kind of giddy and like I start
[371.88 --> 373.80]  to say stuff that's like really kind of stupid.
[373.92 --> 375.50]  You've probably encountered it before.
[375.74 --> 375.90]  Yeah.
[376.04 --> 377.40]  So I actually, you know what?
[377.44 --> 381.60]  I was probably getting to that point when we were talking about our restaurant concept.
[382.44 --> 383.16]  In Vegas.
[383.26 --> 383.40]  Yeah.
[383.40 --> 383.60]  Yeah.
[383.60 --> 383.76]  Yeah.
[383.76 --> 383.88]  Yeah.
[384.00 --> 384.48]  So that's.
[384.50 --> 385.82]  I was too, to a certain degree.
[385.86 --> 386.04]  Okay.
[386.04 --> 387.04]  So that was me.
[387.24 --> 389.74]  Everyone starts laughing at weird stuff when they get super tired.
[389.88 --> 393.30]  So that was my headspace when I was meeting the president of honor.
[394.02 --> 397.60]  Fortunately, it was just a quick photo op and I didn't have to try to say anything intelligent.
[398.32 --> 401.68]  Cause I, I'd have been like, okay, look, I know mobile phones.
[401.88 --> 402.40]  Great business.
[402.78 --> 403.30]  Good idea.
[403.42 --> 404.06]  Keep doing that.
[404.24 --> 406.02]  But do I ever have a pitch for you?
[407.32 --> 407.72]  Okay.
[407.84 --> 411.08]  A restaurant where the menu is loop.
[411.08 --> 411.54]  It's loop.
[412.98 --> 416.40]  I still, I still absolutely love this idea.
[416.88 --> 419.74]  I still, I still think it's a game breaker.
[419.80 --> 421.32]  No, I love the idea too.
[421.40 --> 421.58]  Okay.
[421.58 --> 422.52]  So get this, get this.
[422.58 --> 422.72]  Okay.
[422.76 --> 424.14]  So you go with a group of friends.
[424.14 --> 424.42]  Okay.
[424.78 --> 427.46]  We've actually worked out the concept pretty well now.
[427.46 --> 427.64]  Yeah.
[427.80 --> 428.06]  Yeah.
[428.06 --> 431.12]  So I order like a protein and a salad.
[431.12 --> 431.62]  Okay.
[431.70 --> 432.28]  You order.
[432.64 --> 433.96]  Or protein in like a green.
[434.16 --> 434.34]  Sure.
[434.46 --> 435.52]  A protein and a green.
[435.64 --> 435.90]  Sure.
[436.04 --> 439.54]  I'll go with like a protein and a, and a, a soda.
[440.30 --> 441.16]  Everything's cheap.
[441.50 --> 443.20]  Everything's like five bucks.
[443.32 --> 443.52]  Oh yeah.
[443.72 --> 445.18]  Four dollars or something like that.
[445.22 --> 446.00]  Totally unreasonable.
[446.26 --> 446.38]  Yeah.
[446.42 --> 451.58]  So like, you know, every once in a while your protein, it's going to be a fricking tomahawk steak.
[451.62 --> 451.94]  Oh yeah.
[451.94 --> 452.58]  Yeah.
[452.58 --> 454.88]  And then every once in a while it's going to be a hot rod.
[457.10 --> 460.68]  Like those like 50 cent pepperoni sticks from the, from the gas station.
[460.88 --> 461.28]  Yeah.
[461.28 --> 461.34]  Yeah.
[461.34 --> 462.22]  You might get that.
[462.28 --> 463.16]  You might get that.
[463.46 --> 463.86]  So it'd be great.
[463.86 --> 465.28]  You'll probably usually get that.
[465.32 --> 466.50]  You'll probably usually get that.
[466.50 --> 466.60]  Yeah.
[466.60 --> 468.50]  So you go to the restaurant.
[468.68 --> 471.46]  It's like junk, junk, junk.
[471.84 --> 472.52]  That's okay.
[472.62 --> 473.72]  I only spent 12 dollars.
[474.86 --> 477.66]  So you order like four loot boxes or something.
[477.66 --> 477.88]  Yeah.
[478.12 --> 479.70]  Because maybe you'll get one that's good.
[479.78 --> 479.96]  Yeah.
[479.96 --> 481.50]  You might also get four hot rods.
[481.56 --> 482.92]  You might get four hot rods.
[483.02 --> 484.72]  Or like four hot rods and a pickle.
[484.84 --> 488.76]  But hey, you had an experience.
[489.20 --> 493.36]  The fun was in the excitement of opening up your loot box dinner.
[493.36 --> 493.86]  Yeah.
[494.24 --> 496.92]  You know, I actually like the concept though.
[497.56 --> 498.82]  Oh man, like beverages.
[499.22 --> 500.50]  Beverages would be great.
[501.32 --> 503.90]  The kitchen could have so much fun with that.
[504.52 --> 507.54]  It's like here's tomato, here's tomato paste and apple juice.
[508.68 --> 509.82]  Oh, that's awful.
[510.16 --> 511.72]  Oh, I guess you should get another one then.
[512.08 --> 516.10]  That's a, like an apple juice with Caesar like things inside of it.
[516.10 --> 519.34]  Like bacon and celery and like pepper on the rim.
[519.98 --> 520.34]  How fun.
[520.34 --> 520.66]  Ew.
[523.36 --> 526.28]  It happened.
[526.54 --> 528.92]  Look, that is apparently a sales pitch.
[529.18 --> 531.62]  Hey, hey, it's fun because you don't know what's coming.
[532.34 --> 533.94]  People buy these things.
[534.30 --> 534.48]  Yeah.
[534.72 --> 535.02]  Yeah, yeah.
[535.02 --> 536.80]  I don't make the rules here for people.
[537.90 --> 541.66]  And the best part is you would totally get put out of business.
[542.26 --> 542.54]  Oh, yeah.
[542.62 --> 544.10]  Nobody would stand for that.
[544.18 --> 544.38]  No.
[544.52 --> 547.76]  And then what I love about this is like honestly, I'm kind of.
[547.76 --> 549.96]  You could be wildly successful for like two months.
[549.96 --> 554.10]  I'd be kind of tempted to do it just to make a point.
[554.22 --> 563.30]  If this isn't acceptable in food, if gambling is not okay for a restaurant, then why is it okay in gaming?
[563.56 --> 563.66]  Yeah.
[563.66 --> 567.62]  Just as like a form of protest.
[567.78 --> 569.54]  Like how much would it actually cost us?
[570.16 --> 571.54]  If just a short-term lease.
[571.64 --> 574.64]  There's got to be a place where you can do pop-up restaurants.
[574.96 --> 575.50]  There's got to be.
[575.72 --> 579.66]  I mean, there used to be a Quiznos like in my neighborhood that's just like still set up.
[580.34 --> 581.86]  Loop box freaking sandwich.
[581.86 --> 587.06]  You don't know what combinations of toppings you're going to get.
[587.20 --> 590.42]  This one's six mustards and a pepperoni.
[592.76 --> 594.06]  It's basically liquid.
[594.20 --> 595.26]  Have a good lunch.
[595.32 --> 595.96]  Have a good time.
[598.58 --> 602.02]  Or it's like a build your own sandwich, but you have to loop box all the ingredients.
[602.28 --> 603.26]  I know, right?
[603.54 --> 608.94]  So you like loop boxed your bread and then you loop box all your meats and your greens and your sauces.
[608.94 --> 611.22]  And then you just like figure out what you get at the end.
[612.18 --> 613.28]  Oh my goodness.
[613.58 --> 620.32]  But yeah, there's got to be some form of place where you can do like, oh, your restaurant failed.
[620.44 --> 622.82]  I'll take over your lease for like a few months or something.
[622.82 --> 622.92]  Yeah, right?
[622.94 --> 623.82]  But not permanently.
[623.96 --> 624.76]  Yeah, exactly.
[625.48 --> 627.94]  Honestly, I think it's even a...
[627.94 --> 630.78]  The subway idea.
[632.56 --> 634.72]  Oh, I didn't want to tell people about that.
[634.90 --> 636.32]  But they don't know what that means.
[636.32 --> 636.44]  Oh, okay.
[636.56 --> 637.06]  Sure, sure, sure.
[637.06 --> 637.54]  I don't want...
[637.54 --> 639.48]  That's all I want to go into with that.
[639.62 --> 640.32]  Okay, okay.
[640.44 --> 641.68]  But like...
[641.68 --> 643.98]  Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[644.08 --> 645.92]  No, no, no, no, no.
[645.98 --> 646.22]  Okay.
[646.44 --> 648.16]  It's not like close enough to reality.
[648.22 --> 649.32]  Maybe on Friday.
[650.52 --> 651.54]  Wait, hold on.
[651.58 --> 653.18]  Let me see if I understand you correctly.
[659.34 --> 660.36]  Oh, oh, no, no, no, no.
[660.36 --> 661.46]  No, okay, okay.
[661.46 --> 664.34]  But I mean like using the time of that concept.
[664.94 --> 665.34]  Oh.
[666.54 --> 667.24]  So like...
[667.24 --> 673.32]  The issue is how much work you would have to do to prepare to like open a restaurant.
[673.32 --> 675.84]  Because like you'd have to actually work on the menu.
[676.02 --> 677.82]  You'd have to stock a kitchen of...
[677.82 --> 679.66]  There is unconventional things.
[679.84 --> 680.46]  That, yes.
[680.54 --> 681.82]  You wouldn't have to work on the menu though.
[682.50 --> 682.72]  Oh.
[682.84 --> 683.48]  Because it's just loot boxes.
[683.80 --> 684.36]  Well, okay.
[684.44 --> 686.18]  You'd have to have an internal menu though.
[686.18 --> 688.18]  And then you'd have to have like a dice system.
[690.58 --> 691.02]  There's...
[691.02 --> 692.00]  Well, there's two different ways to do that.
[692.08 --> 693.02]  There's the sandwich.
[693.24 --> 694.66]  You loot box a sandwich.
[694.94 --> 695.34]  Right.
[695.34 --> 697.40]  Or there's loot boxing the ingredients or whatever.
[698.04 --> 698.80]  I don't know.
[698.96 --> 699.48]  Maybe...
[699.48 --> 699.68]  Yeah.
[699.74 --> 700.66]  I'm not sure which one.
[700.68 --> 702.24]  People want it at LTX.
[702.34 --> 703.48]  No, no, no, no.
[703.56 --> 706.94]  We actually want LTX's food options to...
[706.94 --> 707.24]  To be good.
[707.40 --> 709.60]  To be as good as they possibly can be.
[709.80 --> 709.98]  Yeah.
[710.14 --> 711.52]  Are we doing food trucks again?
[712.30 --> 713.18]  So, okay.
[713.24 --> 715.28]  Because we're going to be at the Vancouver Convention Center.
[715.28 --> 717.32]  There's food trucks that are just like always there.
[717.46 --> 718.46]  And it's downtown.
[719.14 --> 719.86]  You have tons of options.
[719.86 --> 720.90]  So, there's tons of places to eat.
[721.00 --> 721.20]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[721.22 --> 723.00]  There is going to be food inside the convention.
[723.26 --> 725.28]  And I think for influencers, for creators...
[725.96 --> 727.28]  Because we have like 10 people...
[727.28 --> 727.92]  A bunch.
[728.16 --> 729.48]  ...that are like interested in coming.
[729.60 --> 730.28]  I'm so excited.
[731.10 --> 731.28]  Yeah.
[731.92 --> 735.06]  But for influencers, we have to have them catered by the venue.
[735.60 --> 739.84]  But then other than that, I don't think there's any obligation for people to buy food at the venue.
[739.84 --> 740.68]  Which is really cool.
[740.78 --> 741.92]  Totally different from last year.
[742.04 --> 742.22]  Yeah.
[742.30 --> 744.22]  Where there just really weren't any options.
[744.40 --> 744.58]  Yeah.
[744.58 --> 747.90]  And I have a really exciting LTX update.
[748.14 --> 749.00]  Believe it or not.
[749.26 --> 750.10]  I have no idea what it is.
[750.16 --> 750.56]  But I'm excited.
[751.20 --> 752.72]  Because I'm just generally excited for LTX.
[752.72 --> 754.84]  So, there's a new update in the blog.
[756.08 --> 758.20]  Oh, that's cool.
[758.40 --> 758.64]  Okay.
[758.74 --> 758.94]  Okay.
[759.02 --> 759.16]  Okay.
[759.16 --> 759.48]  Okay.
[759.48 --> 759.86]  Okay.
[760.00 --> 761.04]  So, just first look.
[761.20 --> 765.02]  First look at some of the booths that we have planned for this year.
[765.82 --> 767.14]  Tech experiences.
[767.62 --> 771.18]  We're going to do a performance versus cost test zone.
[771.18 --> 772.18]  No way.
[772.18 --> 773.50]  So, what we're going to do is ahead of the show.
[773.50 --> 773.78]  No way.
[773.78 --> 782.72]  We're going to do a video on like $500, $1,000, $1,500, $2,500, $5,000 gaming machines.
[782.98 --> 785.68]  And we'll go, we'll spec out the best thing we can.
[786.10 --> 787.80]  Box, peripherals, monitor.
[788.30 --> 788.70]  Boom.
[788.96 --> 790.88]  Here's the gaming experience per dollar.
[791.24 --> 793.26]  Then we're going to load all the same games up on them.
[793.50 --> 795.06]  And you can actually float around.
[795.28 --> 799.92]  So, if you were trying to decide how much money do I want to spend to become a member of the
[799.92 --> 805.40]  PC Master Race, you could just kind of go, oh, well, I want kind of somewhere in between
[805.40 --> 806.06]  here.
[807.02 --> 809.20]  And you can go ahead and you can make a more informed decision.
[809.36 --> 809.52]  Yeah.
[809.64 --> 811.62]  So, are you guys going to have monitor differences there?
[811.68 --> 812.88]  Is that bundled into the thing?
[812.96 --> 813.16]  Yeah.
[813.16 --> 814.74]  Because like $140 versus $60?
[814.74 --> 815.20]  Yes.
[815.98 --> 818.58]  And it will affect the entire gaming experience.
[818.58 --> 818.80]  Yeah.
[818.80 --> 822.20]  But that was sort of the best bet we had for how to do it.
[822.24 --> 828.10]  Because the thing is that even on like a $500 box, if you had a $1,000 monitor with G-Sync
[828.10 --> 833.58]  that has like a really wide variable refresh rate window and stuff, it's going to make it
[833.58 --> 834.58]  seem better than it is.
[834.58 --> 834.76]  Yeah.
[834.96 --> 838.24]  Versus if you were playing on the kind of monitor you would typically have on a rig like
[838.24 --> 838.46]  that.
[838.52 --> 838.68]  Yeah.
[838.80 --> 842.20]  So, we want to make sure that we're representing every price point completely.
[842.56 --> 842.74]  Yeah.
[842.88 --> 843.84]  So, that's the idea.
[843.84 --> 846.62]  The monitor you should probably have at that price point will be with it.
[846.76 --> 847.08]  That's fair.
[848.18 --> 849.24]  Headphone testing zone.
[849.42 --> 853.58]  So, a lot of people ask, well, should I get closed or open backed?
[853.66 --> 857.82]  And that's going to be the main thing here is I think we're trying to get a headphone
[857.82 --> 858.94]  brand to sponsor it.
[858.98 --> 861.34]  So, it would all be like options from the same brand.
[861.94 --> 865.10]  But just to test in a crowded environment.
[865.36 --> 866.96]  You can still get a range of styles.
[867.18 --> 872.02]  Active noise canceling versus just passive noise isolation versus open backed.
[872.02 --> 874.14]  So, that you can really try it out for yourself.
[874.14 --> 874.40]  Yeah.
[874.40 --> 875.80]  And playing games.
[875.80 --> 879.44]  Because like a lot of the time, even if you go to trade shows, if you go to like a headphone
[879.44 --> 882.04]  booth, they don't have any, it's all music.
[882.40 --> 887.14]  Lots of people use like audiophile headphones for gaming because they're smart.
[887.14 --> 891.80]  And so, those smart people can now make a more educated decision.
[891.96 --> 892.12]  Yeah.
[892.38 --> 892.76]  VR.
[893.76 --> 894.52]  Lots of VR.
[895.10 --> 900.10]  So, the VR booth is going to be something like four or five times the size.
[900.26 --> 900.44]  Good.
[900.44 --> 903.16]  And it's going to have between a dozen and 15 headsets.
[903.28 --> 904.28]  That's awesome.
[904.42 --> 905.70]  Last year we had three for reference.
[905.78 --> 906.38]  It was not enough.
[906.46 --> 906.64]  No.
[906.78 --> 906.92]  Yeah.
[906.98 --> 907.98]  So, this is going to be way better.
[908.08 --> 912.40]  I'd also love to have some different experiences lined up.
[912.40 --> 912.52]  Yeah.
[912.60 --> 912.94]  That'd be cool.
[912.96 --> 915.74]  So, that like a couple of the rings are like, it's this game.
[915.94 --> 917.50]  You play head to head with your buddy.
[917.72 --> 918.28]  That'd be awesome.
[918.46 --> 918.64]  Yeah.
[918.86 --> 923.00]  Honestly, I think I always forget the name of it, but it's like Hollow Arena or something.
[923.22 --> 924.18]  I think it's 3v3.
[924.54 --> 926.70]  Having that able to be set up would be really cool.
[926.72 --> 927.48]  I haven't tried that.
[927.64 --> 928.76]  I don't remember the name of it.
[929.00 --> 929.10]  Cool.
[929.24 --> 931.80]  But it's, I always forget the name of it on my show.
[931.82 --> 932.34]  I don't know why.
[932.68 --> 934.58]  But it's a really good game and it'll be a cool experience.
[935.92 --> 936.36]  VR.
[937.36 --> 938.64]  RC Car Race.
[938.82 --> 939.06]  Maybe.
[939.72 --> 940.08]  Okay.
[940.58 --> 942.26]  So, here's what we have planned for this.
[942.26 --> 946.48]  I'm not sure if we're going to end up being able to make it work in VR, actually.
[946.82 --> 949.60]  But you're familiar with like drone racing, right?
[949.78 --> 949.96]  Yeah.
[950.12 --> 955.42]  So, those low latency wireless camera systems that they use for drone racing.
[955.58 --> 955.76]  Yeah.
[955.96 --> 960.44]  There is no real reason why you wouldn't be able to do that on an RC car.
[961.34 --> 967.10]  So, the idea here is that we want to build with like jumps and everything, like a 50 foot
[967.10 --> 968.58]  by 50 foot course.
[971.06 --> 974.10]  That you then get into a virtual cockpit.
[975.46 --> 976.86]  That's so cool.
[977.20 --> 977.86]  Drive on.
[977.98 --> 978.58]  Oh my god.
[978.58 --> 982.96]  So, everyone watching will be just watching these little cars going around on the track.
[983.70 --> 986.68]  But actually, you'll be sitting in the front of the...
[986.68 --> 990.28]  It's going to feel so interesting because are we doing like the actual...
[990.28 --> 991.38]  I'd like to.
[991.80 --> 995.78]  I don't think we're going to go full on like Obaru like racing thing.
[996.18 --> 998.44]  But as long as you've got like kind of a fixed chair...
[998.44 --> 999.90]  One of these kind of chairs would probably feel alright.
[999.90 --> 1002.84]  I'd love to make it work with pedals as well and a wheel.
[1002.98 --> 1003.08]  Yeah.
[1003.08 --> 1006.66]  Like as long as you've got a wheel, pedals and at least a chair that feels kind of like this.
[1006.78 --> 1007.04]  Yes.
[1007.10 --> 1009.82]  Going over one of those jumps and stuff and like ramming someone else.
[1009.90 --> 1010.10]  Yeah.
[1010.18 --> 1010.70]  It's going to be wild.
[1010.74 --> 1011.74]  I think it's going to be pretty cool.
[1011.82 --> 1013.30]  So, that's something that we want to do...
[1013.30 --> 1015.14]  Figure out as a video ahead of time.
[1015.32 --> 1015.56]  Yeah.
[1015.74 --> 1016.62]  And then go from there.
[1016.72 --> 1016.94]  Cool.
[1017.66 --> 1018.94]  An escape room maybe.
[1018.94 --> 1023.78]  I think there's like a local escape room company that wants to set up like a custom escape room experience for us.
[1023.96 --> 1024.08]  Cool.
[1025.16 --> 1027.08]  BS mods, TBD, but they're maniacs.
[1027.60 --> 1030.78]  So, like whatever it is, it's going to be like something modding and cool.
[1030.78 --> 1034.48]  We're going to bring back the workshop concept in full force.
[1034.60 --> 1034.84]  Awesome.
[1034.96 --> 1037.16]  So, not only CPU delidding.
[1037.88 --> 1039.50]  You do need to sign a waiver for that one.
[1039.56 --> 1041.18]  We're not taking responsibility for your dead CPU.
[1041.18 --> 1041.88]  That's a good idea.
[1042.18 --> 1044.64]  But that was a much bigger hit last year than we thought.
[1044.64 --> 1048.80]  So many people showed up with CPUs so that they could delid in a supervised environment.
[1049.00 --> 1054.54]  I had people talking to me about how they wanted to go to the event just because they were too scared of delidding it on their own.
[1054.62 --> 1055.60]  And there's nothing wrong with that.
[1055.66 --> 1056.64]  That totally makes sense.
[1056.78 --> 1057.72]  It's a lot of risk.
[1057.74 --> 1058.74]  Especially if this is the first time you've ever done it.
[1058.80 --> 1059.64]  And check this out.
[1059.64 --> 1071.36]  Steve from Gamers Nexus, who I guess is now outed as someone who is coming, came up with the idea of us doing a GPU disassembly and repasting workshop.
[1071.72 --> 1075.80]  You can actually lower your temperatures on your GPU by a pretty significant margin.
[1076.12 --> 1077.48]  Which he's done a lot of videos on.
[1077.62 --> 1085.70]  And the problem is that pretty much every GPU comes apart and goes back together a little bit differently and has its own intricacies.
[1085.70 --> 1094.06]  So having somewhere where you can do this, because it takes a couple hours if you've never done it before, in a supervised environment with someone that you trust there, you know what?
[1094.10 --> 1097.28]  There's still a chance that something will go wrong, but the odds are much slimmer.
[1097.28 --> 1103.50]  And so, hey, if you want to learn how, if for no reason other than to just learn how and know your hardware better.
[1103.58 --> 1105.20]  Is this another bring your own situation?
[1105.52 --> 1106.32]  Oh, yes.
[1106.42 --> 1110.26]  We should probably do the waiver thing for anything that people bring their own of.
[1110.36 --> 1111.18]  Yes, duly noted.
[1111.40 --> 1111.54]  Yeah.
[1111.86 --> 1112.76]  PC building workshop.
[1113.50 --> 1114.44]  The complete process.
[1114.90 --> 1118.72]  So we want 10 to 15 stations set up with a teacher and a few helpers to guide people through.
[1119.46 --> 1119.66]  Cool.
[1119.66 --> 1121.66]  So we're probably going to lean on our community members.
[1121.84 --> 1123.36]  Actually, link in the Wenshow description.
[1123.48 --> 1123.90]  Volunteers.
[1124.00 --> 1125.56]  We are going to take volunteers.
[1125.72 --> 1128.62]  I'm not sure exactly how we're going to handle the volunteer-ness of it.
[1128.78 --> 1130.78]  That's something that Colton and Steph are figuring out.
[1131.46 --> 1131.86]  Challenges.
[1132.14 --> 1134.04]  There's going to be so much cool stuff at LTX.
[1134.16 --> 1135.10]  I'm like really excited.
[1135.36 --> 1136.42]  I actually went through.
[1136.52 --> 1137.82]  It was on this laptop.
[1138.48 --> 1140.66]  And I did up.
[1140.80 --> 1141.40]  Oh, here it is.
[1141.52 --> 1142.02]  Here's the folder.
[1142.66 --> 1146.28]  I did up concepts for like what I want a bunch of the.
[1146.40 --> 1146.88]  Go away.
[1146.94 --> 1147.22]  Go away.
[1147.48 --> 1147.78]  Hey, Will.
[1148.08 --> 1148.44]  Go away.
[1148.44 --> 1149.20]  Okay.
[1149.38 --> 1152.22]  I did up concepts for what I want a bunch of the booths to look like.
[1152.44 --> 1152.88]  Oh.
[1155.16 --> 1156.08]  You made these?
[1156.56 --> 1156.76]  Well.
[1156.92 --> 1157.10]  Oh.
[1158.26 --> 1159.06]  So like.
[1159.34 --> 1161.64]  They look so much better in tiny thumbnail form.
[1161.92 --> 1162.06]  Yeah.
[1162.14 --> 1164.72]  So this is like a stage.
[1165.26 --> 1166.98]  These are just like tables for the booth.
[1167.06 --> 1169.40]  This is like the cable management challenge.
[1169.58 --> 1169.68]  Yeah.
[1169.78 --> 1169.84]  Yeah.
[1169.86 --> 1171.12]  So it's going to be a timed challenge.
[1171.22 --> 1172.72]  I want it to look kind of crazy.
[1173.26 --> 1174.14]  Kind of like this.
[1175.48 --> 1175.84]  Anyway.
[1175.84 --> 1178.90]  So I did up a bunch of these like sort of mock-ups.
[1178.90 --> 1180.68]  And I'm like really, really excited.
[1180.68 --> 1185.68]  Because we want to get away from the sort of elementary school science fair look.
[1186.16 --> 1186.32]  Yeah.
[1186.32 --> 1189.14]  That we had going on last year with just standard pipe and drape for everything.
[1189.42 --> 1191.42]  Some stuff is still going to be pipe and drape.
[1191.56 --> 1192.50]  Like the VR booth.
[1193.34 --> 1193.74]  Yeah.
[1194.14 --> 1194.84]  You're in VR.
[1194.84 --> 1196.96]  The VR booth didn't even have pipe and drape last time.
[1196.96 --> 1197.28]  I know.
[1198.18 --> 1199.82]  So it's still getting an upgrade.
[1200.26 --> 1200.50]  Yeah.
[1203.06 --> 1203.84]  Don't worry about it.
[1204.06 --> 1204.94]  So here we go.
[1204.98 --> 1205.50]  What else we got?
[1205.58 --> 1205.94]  There we go.
[1206.38 --> 1207.38]  Desk setup challenge.
[1207.50 --> 1211.02]  Whoever can build the sickest desk setup with the parts we provide within the time limit
[1211.02 --> 1211.56]  wins a prize.
[1211.56 --> 1216.22]  So it's going to be like you're going to have desks, chairs, like knickknacks and accessories,
[1216.54 --> 1218.54]  wall hangings, like all kinds of things.
[1218.68 --> 1224.36]  And then you basically have to like do your setup as aesthetic as you can get it.
[1224.70 --> 1225.72]  Snap a selfie with it.
[1225.78 --> 1226.78]  And then you're entered to enterprise.
[1227.34 --> 1227.62]  Cool.
[1227.70 --> 1228.90]  Just like just fun stuff.
[1229.00 --> 1229.34]  Very cool.
[1229.60 --> 1231.82]  Blindfolded cable management is going to be back.
[1232.24 --> 1232.88]  Teams of two.
[1233.02 --> 1235.12]  One person guides the other who is blindfolded.
[1235.12 --> 1236.36]  And we're going to have a ton more stations.
[1236.62 --> 1239.80]  The case toss is going to be back and fairer.
[1239.96 --> 1245.46]  So we are going to palette wrap the cases so they don't get lighter over the course of
[1245.46 --> 1245.76]  the day.
[1246.10 --> 1246.20]  Yeah.
[1246.62 --> 1247.52]  It's a good idea.
[1247.76 --> 1248.32]  It's a good idea.
[1248.68 --> 1249.08]  Sheesh.
[1249.70 --> 1251.04]  The LTT editing den.
[1251.44 --> 1252.76]  Think you can do it better?
[1253.02 --> 1257.42]  We're going to have stations set up with footage on them for people to edit an LTT video within
[1257.42 --> 1258.50]  a specific time frame.
[1258.96 --> 1262.16]  Participants will win a prize and we'll have a grand prize for whoever does it best.
[1262.22 --> 1262.62]  That's cool.
[1262.72 --> 1264.30]  Is it like a short version of a video?
[1264.92 --> 1265.94]  I don't know.
[1265.94 --> 1267.64]  It'll probably be shorter-ish.
[1268.34 --> 1270.52]  House of cards slash motherboards.
[1270.94 --> 1272.52]  How high can you stack motherboards?
[1273.86 --> 1276.38]  The top people for the days will win prizes.
[1276.52 --> 1277.38]  Probably motherboards.
[1277.66 --> 1278.00]  All right.
[1278.06 --> 1278.50]  There you go.
[1279.00 --> 1280.46]  Minesweeper competition will be back.
[1280.54 --> 1283.66]  Props to those who spent almost the entirety of last year trying to beat the records.
[1284.30 --> 1288.74]  We're going to have a much expanded booth for this and even more ridiculous prizes for
[1288.74 --> 1289.94]  those who can top the leaderboards.
[1290.12 --> 1290.32]  Nice.
[1290.58 --> 1291.26]  Guess that motherboard.
[1291.46 --> 1292.92]  We're going to have a wall of painted motherboards.
[1293.06 --> 1294.18]  Guess a certain number of them correctly.
[1294.18 --> 1294.90]  Painted ones.
[1294.92 --> 1295.74]  You can win a prize.
[1295.74 --> 1296.76]  Games.
[1297.30 --> 1298.90]  Retro console gaming area.
[1299.30 --> 1300.42]  Board game lounge area.
[1300.54 --> 1301.20]  So you can just chill.
[1301.32 --> 1302.58]  We'll get a bunch of board games and stuff.
[1303.00 --> 1306.12]  And of course, the DreamHack BYOC and DreamHack Freeplay.
[1306.86 --> 1307.66]  Displays.
[1307.74 --> 1308.92]  System showcases.
[1309.22 --> 1310.70]  SI's, partners, enthusiasts, modders.
[1310.76 --> 1312.60]  We're going to have whatever cool stuff we can get there.
[1312.94 --> 1313.76]  10 years of PCs.
[1314.06 --> 1315.04]  This one is going to be fun.
[1315.04 --> 1321.42]  So we're going to build a state of the art PC for every year from 2009 to 2019 with a flagship
[1321.42 --> 1326.28]  game like kind of the quintessential game from that year running on each one of them.
[1327.28 --> 1327.68]  Nice.
[1327.68 --> 1331.00]  And we're just going to kind of have them there for people to check out and enjoy.
[1331.12 --> 1333.24]  So we're going to have to hit eBay pretty hard for that stuff.
[1333.32 --> 1333.48]  Yeah.
[1333.48 --> 1336.36]  But that's something that we're going to do as a video ahead of time as well.
[1336.36 --> 1336.86]  I was going to say, yeah.
[1337.18 --> 1338.02]  Is that one video?
[1338.12 --> 1339.02]  So we're getting...
[1339.02 --> 1339.90]  It'll have to be.
[1339.90 --> 1341.92]  I mean, look.
[1342.44 --> 1343.26]  So, okay.
[1344.22 --> 1349.74]  The idea with LTX this year is that even if it costs us a whack of money, Linus Media
[1349.74 --> 1351.88]  Group doesn't really do like marketing.
[1352.70 --> 1358.52]  And we don't hit up like the charity streams that hard or any of those kind of typical ways
[1358.52 --> 1359.66]  of giving back to the community.
[1360.24 --> 1367.12]  And so the way that I see it here is that LTX is sort of our chance to just go, you know
[1367.12 --> 1370.78]  what, community, let's just put on like a giant party.
[1371.08 --> 1371.22]  Yeah.
[1371.28 --> 1373.50]  So I'm sort of past making money on it at this point.
[1373.66 --> 1373.86]  Cool.
[1373.98 --> 1376.90]  If we can make money on it in the future, hey, great.
[1377.02 --> 1378.34]  Like obviously this is...
[1378.34 --> 1379.22]  I'm running a business here.
[1379.26 --> 1380.08]  That's not a bad thing.
[1380.12 --> 1380.96]  I'm not going to say no.
[1381.06 --> 1381.62]  No, please.
[1381.70 --> 1382.04]  No money.
[1382.52 --> 1383.48]  No money.
[1383.70 --> 1386.26]  This is like a sort of like a lost leader kind of situation.
[1386.26 --> 1390.86]  This year, the intention is if you show up at LTX, we're going to have done our darndest
[1390.86 --> 1392.04]  to make it just...
[1392.04 --> 1392.82]  To make it freaking awesome.
[1392.92 --> 1394.88]  A crazy fun experience.
[1394.88 --> 1399.08]  You know, I'm not going to say money is no object, but there is...
[1400.04 --> 1403.76]  I'm probably going to end up spending about a quarter million dollars on it.
[1404.16 --> 1405.08]  So like...
[1406.04 --> 1408.82]  This is not going to be cheap.
[1410.82 --> 1412.00]  Let's have a lot of fun.
[1412.30 --> 1414.08]  I don't expect to get that back.
[1414.30 --> 1414.66]  Okay.
[1415.00 --> 1416.52]  I hope to get some of it back.
[1417.04 --> 1417.40]  All right.
[1417.88 --> 1419.02]  But this is like...
[1419.02 --> 1424.74]  In the past years, I think we held back a little bit because we were trying to do our
[1424.74 --> 1425.24]  usual thing.
[1425.36 --> 1426.36]  And make everything sustainable.
[1426.64 --> 1430.26]  If we need to have a breakout year, this is probably the year to do it.
[1430.46 --> 1431.06]  I think so.
[1431.12 --> 1432.16]  Teaming with DreamHack.
[1432.46 --> 1433.48]  Moving to a bigger venue.
[1434.48 --> 1436.76]  A bunch of creators saw it last year and want to come back.
[1436.88 --> 1436.98]  Yeah.
[1437.12 --> 1438.46]  This is probably the time.
[1438.56 --> 1439.32]  And you know what?
[1439.32 --> 1443.74]  If we kind of go, well, that was crazy and like people didn't even care that much.
[1444.08 --> 1444.44]  Oops.
[1444.64 --> 1448.38]  Then we can always dial it back for the next year and do a smaller, more intimate thing
[1448.38 --> 1448.82]  or whatever.
[1448.98 --> 1449.32]  Like LTX...
[1449.96 --> 1452.40]  And you might even see like certain booths.
[1452.52 --> 1456.74]  Like maybe we need to double the VR booth again or maybe it needs to be half the size
[1456.74 --> 1457.38]  or whatever.
[1457.38 --> 1458.66]  But we can like adjust from there.
[1458.66 --> 1464.48]  There isn't that many conventions that I know of at least where the convention hosts are setting
[1464.48 --> 1466.58]  up a whole bunch of the booths.
[1466.88 --> 1467.28]  It's really expensive.
[1467.28 --> 1470.52]  Usually they like get other people to pay them to put booths in.
[1470.54 --> 1471.76]  It's because it's really expensive.
[1471.88 --> 1472.12]  Yeah.
[1472.38 --> 1472.58]  Yeah.
[1472.68 --> 1476.90]  The issue for us though is that we are going to have some partner stuff there.
[1476.98 --> 1480.48]  Like we've already got some PC manufacturers that are going to pay to be there.
[1480.56 --> 1481.80]  But it's not a lot.
[1482.52 --> 1484.26]  Just real talk, guys.
[1484.40 --> 1485.26]  Like it's not a lot.
[1485.34 --> 1486.68]  It doesn't really make a dent.
[1487.38 --> 1490.90]  And we don't want it to be all about that anyway.
[1490.90 --> 1496.22]  We want it to be fun for the community first and then making money second.
[1496.48 --> 1503.06]  And Colton's like, Colton's like, okay, this is a big reversal of direction.
[1503.22 --> 1506.48]  Because the first two years I was like, look, the plan is to make this thing sustainable
[1506.48 --> 1508.66]  and like, you know, build it.
[1508.74 --> 1508.98]  Build it.
[1509.02 --> 1509.52]  Slow roll out.
[1509.62 --> 1510.42]  Colton, do you have something to say?
[1510.54 --> 1513.14]  You can come on here and say it.
[1513.40 --> 1514.58]  The microphone's over here.
[1514.76 --> 1517.76]  So Colton and Steph are on point for LTX this year.
[1518.12 --> 1519.44]  I'm hyping it pretty good here.
[1519.74 --> 1520.10]  Nice.
[1520.22 --> 1520.50]  Awesome.
[1520.50 --> 1521.42]  Yeah, it has to be amazing.
[1521.60 --> 1522.12]  It's going to be sick.
[1522.18 --> 1522.60]  But it will be.
[1522.76 --> 1523.22]  It's going to be sick.
[1523.28 --> 1524.42]  We're like giving it our all.
[1524.56 --> 1525.12]  Like actually.
[1526.24 --> 1527.14]  Maybe not our all.
[1527.56 --> 1528.90]  We're giving it a lot of us.
[1529.18 --> 1529.74]  A lot.
[1529.84 --> 1530.04]  Yeah.
[1530.24 --> 1530.52]  Yeah.
[1530.62 --> 1531.98]  Like, yeah.
[1531.98 --> 1532.94]  Go big or go home.
[1533.08 --> 1533.80]  Like legitimately.
[1534.06 --> 1534.76]  Like actually.
[1534.92 --> 1537.28]  Like the venue is, how big is the venue again?
[1537.44 --> 1539.18]  It's like 80,000 square feet.
[1539.34 --> 1540.46]  Well, that we're taking.
[1540.66 --> 1540.84]  Yeah.
[1541.20 --> 1541.58]  Yeah.
[1541.72 --> 1542.04]  And we're still.
[1542.04 --> 1542.70]  That's not even DreamHex?
[1543.66 --> 1544.46]  Or is you doing that?
[1544.46 --> 1545.28]  No, I think that's the total.
[1545.28 --> 1545.60]  Okay, yeah.
[1545.60 --> 1546.48]  I was like, what the heck.
[1546.60 --> 1546.74]  Okay.
[1546.74 --> 1546.94]  Yeah.
[1547.16 --> 1548.24]  We actually expanded it.
[1548.24 --> 1549.38]  We actually had initially.
[1549.50 --> 1549.82]  We're like, okay.
[1549.96 --> 1552.06]  This is like already like double the size.
[1552.22 --> 1552.88]  Of last year.
[1552.98 --> 1554.12]  And then Linus would tell you.
[1554.18 --> 1554.32]  He's like.
[1555.54 --> 1555.94]  No.
[1556.34 --> 1557.14]  No, we need more.
[1557.48 --> 1558.08]  We need more.
[1559.08 --> 1559.34]  So, yeah.
[1559.50 --> 1559.66]  And these.
[1559.84 --> 1562.50]  The look on his and Yvonne's face when I was in that meeting.
[1562.84 --> 1563.34]  Because we were like.
[1563.34 --> 1563.64]  I was just like.
[1563.70 --> 1564.90]  There's another ballroom, right?
[1565.76 --> 1566.16]  Yeah.
[1566.84 --> 1567.34]  Book it.
[1567.84 --> 1570.52]  Well, I'm not sure if DreamHack is down for that.
[1570.74 --> 1571.10]  Book it.
[1571.22 --> 1571.72]  Just do it.
[1571.72 --> 1572.10]  Book it.
[1572.16 --> 1572.62]  Just do it.
[1572.62 --> 1573.28]  But yeah.
[1573.28 --> 1573.74]  It's going to be good.
[1573.96 --> 1574.72]  I don't.
[1574.78 --> 1575.26]  I don't.
[1575.60 --> 1577.56]  I don't want it to be.
[1578.02 --> 1578.26]  Like.
[1578.30 --> 1580.48]  I don't want people to walk in and feel like.
[1581.00 --> 1582.46]  They didn't try that hard.
[1582.68 --> 1584.96]  You don't want to necessarily have completely blown the bank.
[1585.02 --> 1586.50]  But you don't want there to have been compromises.
[1586.76 --> 1587.06]  Yeah.
[1587.14 --> 1587.36]  I mean.
[1587.36 --> 1588.04]  The thing is like.
[1588.18 --> 1591.08]  I feel like people really enjoyed the last ones.
[1591.08 --> 1594.74]  But it was mostly from just like an engaging with us as a community perspective.
[1595.06 --> 1595.70]  And I just.
[1595.90 --> 1597.26]  I felt like we can do more.
[1597.58 --> 1597.70]  Yeah.
[1598.12 --> 1598.60]  Yeah, exactly.
[1598.70 --> 1599.92]  There should be more elements to it.
[1599.92 --> 1601.94]  Like it's not just like community is really important.
[1601.94 --> 1603.10]  Like the main stage has needed an upgrade.
[1603.20 --> 1605.50]  I want people's one pluses not to be bored.
[1606.08 --> 1606.34]  Yeah.
[1606.66 --> 1610.08]  And that's a tough thing to do when it's just like.
[1610.08 --> 1612.56]  When the main attraction is like hanging out with the LMG crew.
[1613.22 --> 1614.48]  And the float plane crew as it were.
[1615.40 --> 1616.34]  Talking about like a video.
[1616.48 --> 1617.74]  Like oh I would love doing this video.
[1617.86 --> 1618.88]  And their plus ones like what?
[1619.52 --> 1620.16]  Who is this guy?
[1620.20 --> 1622.96]  That annoying voice that's always on in the background when I'm trying to sleep.
[1623.08 --> 1624.02]  This guy wearing sandals.
[1624.12 --> 1624.54]  What is this?
[1625.30 --> 1625.54]  So.
[1625.82 --> 1626.40]  Yeah, it's going to be real good.
[1626.44 --> 1627.54]  Did you go through the whole thing already?
[1627.72 --> 1628.34]  Not yet.
[1628.56 --> 1628.92]  Actually.
[1629.02 --> 1629.38]  Most of it.
[1629.38 --> 1633.08]  I haven't even talked about one of the things that Luke is going to like flip his wig over.
[1634.04 --> 1636.86]  So it looks like there's a chance.
[1636.98 --> 1637.58]  And we basically.
[1638.00 --> 1639.60]  When this guy reached out.
[1640.50 --> 1643.24]  This guy's vintage PC collection is nuts.
[1643.44 --> 1643.66]  Oh dude.
[1643.68 --> 1644.92]  Like go check his channel out.
[1645.10 --> 1646.84]  I was like just moving over.
[1646.84 --> 1647.18]  Act the cuckoo.
[1647.54 --> 1647.96]  Or whatever.
[1648.36 --> 1649.84]  I don't know how to pronounce it honestly.
[1650.04 --> 1650.52]  Yeah, it doesn't matter.
[1650.58 --> 1650.92]  It doesn't matter.
[1651.00 --> 1651.54]  The point is.
[1651.90 --> 1654.46]  His vintage PC collection is insane.
[1654.46 --> 1656.26]  And as soon as this guy reached out.
[1656.34 --> 1657.52]  I was like Colton.
[1657.94 --> 1659.34]  You cover this man's travel.
[1659.68 --> 1662.00]  You cover this man's transportation for his collection.
[1662.00 --> 1662.78]  Props to him.
[1662.84 --> 1663.82]  He's like I'll bring everything.
[1664.16 --> 1665.52]  I'm going to bring all of it.
[1665.62 --> 1665.92]  Everything.
[1666.02 --> 1670.02]  The guy's got like so many different PCs and systems and stuff like that.
[1670.02 --> 1672.68]  So just even just looking at his channel.
[1672.88 --> 1674.06]  Just the thumbnails on his channel.
[1674.16 --> 1675.28]  It's like oh wow.
[1676.14 --> 1676.56]  Yeah.
[1676.86 --> 1677.08]  Yeah.
[1677.08 --> 1677.58]  Jeez.
[1677.82 --> 1680.88]  So basically we've just kind of gone okay.
[1681.00 --> 1683.22]  Here's like thousands of dollars worth of booth space.
[1683.58 --> 1686.38]  Here's thousands of dollars worth of expense transporting all this stuff.
[1686.44 --> 1687.02]  We don't even care.
[1687.18 --> 1688.00]  Just do it.
[1688.06 --> 1688.66]  Come on up here.
[1689.06 --> 1691.30]  Like we want it to be really really community driven.
[1691.46 --> 1692.12]  Really collaborative.
[1692.72 --> 1693.58]  Really excited.
[1694.88 --> 1695.78]  That's really cool.
[1695.82 --> 1698.02]  The CNC demo is not confirmed yet.
[1698.02 --> 1703.56]  But we might have someone with a CNC machine at the venue to actually CNC stuff like for people.
[1703.84 --> 1704.34]  That's cool.
[1704.42 --> 1704.94]  For attendees.
[1705.18 --> 1706.34]  Now that might not be free.
[1706.34 --> 1708.92]  That might be something that you have to pay 10 bucks for or 20 bucks for.
[1708.94 --> 1710.04]  And it'll probably need to be small things.
[1710.04 --> 1710.38]  Or whatever.
[1710.54 --> 1711.66]  It would have to be small things.
[1712.00 --> 1715.02]  But just what kind of what a cool souvenir.
[1715.08 --> 1715.60]  Cool little yeah.
[1715.82 --> 1716.06]  Right?
[1716.22 --> 1716.36]  Yeah.
[1717.78 --> 1722.46]  If you want something cool to get signed because a lot of people are wondering like what should
[1722.46 --> 1724.22]  do I bring a piece of paper that's kind of boring?
[1724.30 --> 1725.52]  Like what do I get to get signed?
[1725.78 --> 1727.64]  Maybe get a little thingy for the CNC machine.
[1727.64 --> 1729.26]  DreamHack Indie Dev Zone.
[1729.42 --> 1730.18]  Size TBD.
[1730.48 --> 1732.98]  But there's lots of Vancouver based indie devs.
[1733.36 --> 1734.50]  Charity Silent Auction.
[1734.88 --> 1739.96]  So we're going to find a bunch of cool stuff from the warehouse and do a like a probably
[1739.96 --> 1742.44]  BC Children's Hospital or Extra Life or something like that.
[1743.20 --> 1744.44]  Where's Luke's scavenger hunt?
[1744.54 --> 1745.88]  It'll be more organized this time.
[1745.96 --> 1746.26]  I promise.
[1746.46 --> 1746.64]  Okay.
[1747.04 --> 1747.96]  Creator meetup area.
[1748.04 --> 1751.92]  So there will be a dedicated space where creators can get into and out of it discreetly.
[1752.42 --> 1755.56]  That was a big problem last year is like when we had a scheduled time for people
[1755.56 --> 1756.18]  to hang out.
[1756.68 --> 1758.32]  That's a problem at like every show.
[1758.32 --> 1760.62]  They like swarmed on the way to, swarmed on the way from.
[1760.72 --> 1762.06]  You can't get through the door too.
[1762.36 --> 1768.22]  Main stage, merch, impromptu events and more to come.
[1768.34 --> 1769.58]  What a blog post.
[1769.58 --> 1774.72]  I can't tell you guys when tickets are going on sale yet.
[1775.16 --> 1779.58]  We're still working out things like the revenue split with DreamHack, which as you can imagine
[1779.58 --> 1784.20]  is a little bit complicated because we have sort of different visions for exactly, you
[1784.20 --> 1786.02]  know, what it is.
[1786.02 --> 1792.12]  Like we're coming together from like the perspective of like, we really want to work together and
[1792.12 --> 1793.38]  we're going to make this work.
[1793.38 --> 1797.72]  But like we are very different organizations with very different goals.
[1798.00 --> 1802.44]  So there's just, there's some, there's some things to figure out, but like both our team
[1802.44 --> 1805.66]  and their team are super dedicated to just making it happen.
[1806.02 --> 1810.14]  And it could be one of those things where after this year we might go, yeah, you know
[1810.14 --> 1810.28]  what?
[1810.30 --> 1813.12]  That didn't really work that great, but that's not what we want.
[1813.36 --> 1817.04]  We're trying to build this as a sustainable thing because I think-
[1817.04 --> 1817.76]  It'd be really cool to keep this going.
[1817.76 --> 1822.92]  I think DreamHack adds a lot of street cred and a lot of value to the event and they feel
[1822.92 --> 1825.70]  like we add a lot of street cred and a lot of value to the event.
[1825.86 --> 1826.54]  So like-
[1826.54 --> 1831.54]  And like it's, it's such a really cool combo in terms of like mixing the pieces because
[1831.54 --> 1831.96]  there's lands-
[1831.96 --> 1832.62]  Oh, they're so different.
[1832.80 --> 1838.06]  There's lands that have like a hardware focus, but it's not really the same and there's,
[1838.46 --> 1842.34]  well, there isn't actually really hardware conventions, but we did that sort of, but it
[1842.34 --> 1843.24]  didn't have the other side.
[1843.24 --> 1845.26]  Like there's creator focused events.
[1845.26 --> 1845.98]  There's also that.
[1845.98 --> 1847.94]  There's hardware focused ones.
[1847.94 --> 1849.48]  There's gaming focused ones.
[1849.48 --> 1855.54]  There's LAN party focused ones, but us plus DreamHack kind of brings it all together.
[1855.54 --> 1856.08]  We hope.
[1856.50 --> 1856.90]  We hope.
[1856.98 --> 1857.90]  That's what we're going to try and do.
[1858.02 --> 1858.20]  Yeah.
[1858.28 --> 1861.68]  And you won't lose that hardware focus because a lot of these events like, like original
[1861.68 --> 1862.32]  PAXs.
[1862.46 --> 1867.50]  I remember one of the first PAXs I went to, one entire wall of the convention was all
[1867.50 --> 1867.92]  NVIDIA.
[1868.72 --> 1870.00]  The whole thing.
[1870.28 --> 1872.00]  They rented out the entire wall.
[1872.20 --> 1873.36]  Now you're lucky if NVIDIA shows up.
[1873.46 --> 1873.72]  Yeah.
[1873.90 --> 1875.46]  The hardware focus is like gone.
[1875.46 --> 1878.14]  So it's cool that we have another one of those too.
[1878.24 --> 1878.58]  I don't know.
[1878.72 --> 1879.36]  I'm super excited.
[1880.14 --> 1881.18]  Super stoked.
[1881.18 --> 1884.52]  Got people asking, will LTX 2019 be live streamed?
[1886.84 --> 1887.28]  Colton!
[1890.56 --> 1891.52]  I think I hear him.
[1891.80 --> 1893.62]  Why don't we, why don't we roll the intro?
[1893.72 --> 1894.48]  Because we never did that.
[1894.84 --> 1895.66]  Buy ourselves some time.
[1896.04 --> 1901.26]  Like over half an hour into the stream.
[1902.62 --> 1903.02]  Whatever.
[1903.18 --> 1903.64]  Minor details.
[1903.84 --> 1904.28]  Minor details.
[1904.28 --> 1904.38]  Minor details.
[1906.58 --> 1906.88]  Oh.
[1915.22 --> 1915.80]  Oh yeah.
[1916.30 --> 1916.54]  Good.
[1916.54 --> 1917.18]  Oh, okay.
[1917.28 --> 1918.22]  Well, I wasn't, I wasn't sure.
[1918.24 --> 1919.06]  Yeah, you're good dude.
[1919.06 --> 1921.94]  I never know which things I'm allowed to talk about and which ones I'm not.
[1925.76 --> 1926.90]  You can talk about it.
[1927.12 --> 1928.96]  Yeah, we can talk about that there will be a thing.
[1929.24 --> 1929.72]  It'll be a thing.
[1929.88 --> 1930.74]  Okay, we'll figure out how.
[1930.88 --> 1932.84]  Is it though? Because the split is like actually super complicated.
[1935.62 --> 1937.00]  It'll be a thing. We'll figure it out.
[1937.14 --> 1937.74]  We'll figure it out.
[1937.74 --> 1937.90]  Okay.
[1938.00 --> 1939.44]  Use your best judgment, boys.
[1939.80 --> 1940.74]  Okay, yes.
[1941.14 --> 1943.58]  There will be some kind of live streaming option.
[1943.58 --> 1950.38]  Now, I can't promise that we're going to have like a live feed following me the whole time
[1950.38 --> 1954.48]  or like a live feed following around every single creator the whole time
[1954.48 --> 1959.84]  with like eight different, you know, LTX1, LTX2, LTX, like be realistic.
[1960.44 --> 1966.62]  So there will be hopefully a live stream of the vast majority of the stage stuff.
[1967.24 --> 1972.04]  And then I believe we are intending to broadcast the WAN show live from LTX.
[1972.36 --> 1972.48]  Yeah.
[1972.48 --> 1974.92]  And that one will be available to everyone.
[1975.10 --> 1982.94]  But it is probable, highly probable, that things like panels will be limited to people with a virtual ticket.
[1983.52 --> 1986.42]  Similar to what's been done at other kinds of events in the past.
[1986.76 --> 1990.80]  Again, we are putting a lot of money into this and we don't expect all of it back.
[1990.90 --> 1994.50]  But we also, we don't like just putting it in a fire for LOLs.
[1995.76 --> 1997.44]  Do you want to explain how the virtual ticket will work?
[1997.80 --> 1999.06]  We don't know that yet.
[1999.22 --> 1999.44]  Okay.
[1999.44 --> 2001.46]  Um, yeah.
[2001.88 --> 2007.02]  It's, I mean, you know, we have a really close partnership with Floatplane Media.
[2007.98 --> 2012.90]  So there's a strong possibility that it'll have something to do with Floatplane.
[2012.90 --> 2013.98]  Um.
[2017.58 --> 2017.98]  Yeah.
[2019.32 --> 2019.68]  Yeah.
[2021.68 --> 2025.16]  I guess, I guess it's, it's not all like in writing yet.
[2025.32 --> 2026.34]  So we can't, we can't go too specific.
[2026.34 --> 2027.82]  So we can't get into too many details.
[2028.22 --> 2032.10]  We're going to work it out with, we're going to work it out with Floatplane Media.
[2032.22 --> 2036.50]  Those guys, I mean, they're not like Dreamhack where like we really want to work with them.
[2037.08 --> 2038.96]  You know, they're just kind of.
[2039.42 --> 2040.20]  They're just there.
[2040.36 --> 2041.08]  They're just there.
[2041.16 --> 2042.70]  They're actually like always there.
[2042.78 --> 2044.48]  They're a pretty adequate video service.
[2044.56 --> 2045.46]  Yeah, pretty adequate video service.
[2046.16 --> 2046.94]  Is that what it's called?
[2046.94 --> 2047.46]  Pretty adequate?
[2047.92 --> 2047.98]  Or.
[2047.98 --> 2049.50]  No, it's just adequate video service.
[2049.52 --> 2050.16]  Adequate video service.
[2050.28 --> 2050.60]  Yeah.
[2050.60 --> 2051.10]  Yeah.
[2051.48 --> 2053.04]  We actually own the domain.
[2054.60 --> 2055.64]  Adequatevideoservice.com.
[2056.00 --> 2061.20]  So I was joking to Luke that we should, for the people who like to, who like to dig around
[2061.20 --> 2066.08]  in the nuts and bolts of like video players, that should be like our backend delivery domain.
[2066.40 --> 2067.86]  So people like, wait, what?
[2068.04 --> 2068.70]  What is this?
[2068.70 --> 2069.96]  What is adequate video service?
[2069.96 --> 2070.48]  Where does it come from?
[2070.74 --> 2074.64]  And then when you go to like adequatevideoservice.com, it should just redirect to something like,
[2075.02 --> 2077.68]  could you set it so it's just like a Russian roulette of redirection?
[2077.98 --> 2079.38]  I just like, it goes.
[2079.66 --> 2080.74]  It's like daily motion.
[2083.12 --> 2083.84]  It's there.
[2083.96 --> 2086.22]  I don't know why, but it's, I mean, it's whatever.
[2087.42 --> 2090.64]  Oh, oh, speaking of that, we still do need to make money.
[2090.66 --> 2094.36]  Someone in the Flowplane chat is like, Flowplane Media, aren't they like an indie upstart or something?
[2095.66 --> 2096.30]  Kind of, yeah.
[2096.54 --> 2097.32]  Yeah, actually.
[2097.50 --> 2097.76]  Honey.
[2098.26 --> 2098.58]  Hey.
[2098.58 --> 2101.94]  Head over to joinhoney.com slash Linus and start saving today.
[2102.02 --> 2105.70]  You've probably heard us talk about Honey, the free browser extension that helps you save money
[2105.70 --> 2108.12]  on popular sites like Amazon.
[2108.26 --> 2109.22]  Have you heard of Amazon before?
[2109.74 --> 2110.66]  Aren't they a small indie company?
[2110.66 --> 2111.28]  You ever heard of Amazon?
[2111.42 --> 2116.46]  Yeah, I think they're, it's kind of like a jungle, like they've got like a jungle theme going on.
[2116.46 --> 2117.10]  They sell books.
[2117.62 --> 2119.40]  Oh, I thought wallpapers.
[2119.76 --> 2120.56]  You know, it's so funny.
[2120.66 --> 2121.90]  I was watching this thing.
[2121.90 --> 2128.08]  It was like a, I forget what the, like 1997, like thing about Jeff Bezos.
[2129.32 --> 2132.48]  And, and it was like, yeah, he sells books online.
[2132.90 --> 2134.14]  And I was like, oh, right.
[2134.52 --> 2135.74]  It used to be a bookstore.
[2137.26 --> 2137.62]  Anyway.
[2137.92 --> 2139.80]  You saw the one where he had like a door as a desk?
[2139.80 --> 2140.10]  Yeah.
[2140.18 --> 2140.78]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2140.82 --> 2141.80]  It's actually really good.
[2141.80 --> 2142.20]  It's really good.
[2142.26 --> 2142.40]  Yeah.
[2142.66 --> 2145.14]  And like the host is like, oh, good luck with that.
[2145.20 --> 2145.42]  Yeah.
[2145.52 --> 2145.72]  Yeah.
[2145.72 --> 2148.40]  That's a bit weird.
[2148.50 --> 2156.02]  Anyway, as you shop on sites like Amazon, Honey automatically compares the prices of millions of sellers that carry the item that you want.
[2156.26 --> 2162.98]  They even factor in shipping costs, sales tax, and Amazon prime status to make sure you always get the lowest total price.
[2163.28 --> 2166.52]  And the coolest thing about Honey is that you don't have to pay for it.
[2166.52 --> 2167.34]  It's for free.
[2167.66 --> 2171.08]  They get their commission from the sellers rather than from you.
[2171.44 --> 2173.48]  So head over to honey.com slash Linus.
[2173.48 --> 2176.88]  We're going to have that linked below and check it out today.
[2178.28 --> 2182.48]  Next up, we've got private internet access.
[2182.94 --> 2191.06]  Private internet access supports a variety of VPN protocols and types of encryption and authentication, allowing you to get the exact level of privacy protection that you need.
[2191.06 --> 2196.80]  They've got apps for Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Linux, and Google Chrome with support for other platforms coming.
[2197.16 --> 2200.50]  You can connect up to five devices at a time with a single account.
[2200.50 --> 2205.90]  And their internet kill switch will block all traffic if the VPN becomes disconnected unexpectedly.
[2206.22 --> 2209.90]  Check it out today at lmg.gg slash PIA Wham.
[2210.92 --> 2211.32]  Bam.
[2211.52 --> 2215.00]  That was the most professional I think you've done at PIA Spot in a while.
[2215.10 --> 2216.26]  I can dial it back a little.
[2220.96 --> 2224.30]  And Savage Jerky brought to you by Moho Flavor.
[2224.50 --> 2225.50]  Oh my god.
[2225.50 --> 2225.74]  Savage Jerky.
[2225.82 --> 2226.50]  Oh my god.
[2226.50 --> 2228.72]  I don't need this jerky.
[2233.52 --> 2234.78]  But I'm going to eat it.
[2235.12 --> 2236.32]  You cleared me out.
[2241.18 --> 2242.58]  I don't know what it's saying.
[2242.70 --> 2244.12]  Chat's like Luke is dead.
[2250.26 --> 2251.02]  Oh man.
[2251.10 --> 2251.68]  You want some Moho?
[2251.90 --> 2252.22]  What?
[2253.22 --> 2254.62]  Got to air it out first.
[2254.62 --> 2255.76]  Oh my goodness.
[2255.76 --> 2258.54]  It's a good thing we're in like an open air warehouse, you know?
[2258.56 --> 2258.80]  Yeah.
[2258.98 --> 2262.72]  We've got like thousands of cubic feet of airspace here.
[2264.30 --> 2265.20]  Oh my goodness.
[2266.04 --> 2266.68]  Oh man.
[2266.76 --> 2275.00]  Savage Jerky is made of high quality ingredients without nitrates or preservatives with the goal of leaving a snack that's full of flavor and spice but that isn't bad for you.
[2275.06 --> 2275.84]  It's also handmade.
[2275.84 --> 2283.40]  One of their flavors, the Moho Premium Jerky is one of the tamest in their lineup in terms of heat but it's just really flavorful.
[2283.48 --> 2288.44]  It's got lime, cilantro, garlic, cumin and it helps bring out that fantastic beef flavor.
[2288.54 --> 2294.58]  You guys can use offer code LTT to save 10% on all their products over at SavageJerky.com.
[2295.58 --> 2297.26]  I still recommend the maple buffalo bacon.
[2297.64 --> 2298.80]  Where's my maple buffalo bacon?
[2298.90 --> 2299.98]  I swear we have some right now.
[2300.38 --> 2301.02]  Moho jalapeno.
[2301.02 --> 2304.26]  I thought they were getting you like a crate or something.
[2304.88 --> 2305.24]  I don't know.
[2306.22 --> 2307.24]  Maybe for like LTX or something.
[2307.32 --> 2310.42]  Someone in Flowplane chat was like most professional CEO 2019.
[2312.62 --> 2313.18]  Heck yeah.
[2313.56 --> 2313.94]  That was good.
[2314.54 --> 2315.54]  Should we talk about a topic?
[2316.12 --> 2317.58]  Um, yeah.
[2317.72 --> 2317.90]  No.
[2318.28 --> 2319.22]  Yeah, let's do that.
[2319.44 --> 2321.20]  Chrome to break ad blockers.
[2321.26 --> 2323.06]  So the original article here is from the register.
[2323.64 --> 2325.76]  Right after Edge decides to switch to Chromium.
[2325.94 --> 2327.96]  You know, isn't that funny timing?
[2328.64 --> 2330.82]  I think that's very funny timing.
[2331.02 --> 2334.32]  What is this?
[2334.62 --> 2337.38]  I'm just finding that timing very unexpected.
[2338.18 --> 2340.06]  So Edge switches to Chrome.
[2341.38 --> 2343.10]  And Google says, you know what?
[2343.26 --> 2345.78]  Chromium, we're just going to block ad blockers.
[2345.98 --> 2351.08]  You know, it's just funny because isn't Google's business serving ads online?
[2352.12 --> 2354.42]  Now look, I don't wear a tinfoil hat.
[2354.42 --> 2358.68]  But I have to say, I think this is a very stunning coincidence.
[2359.32 --> 2361.36]  This should be your version of Lyle.
[2361.36 --> 2364.16]  You should be.
[2364.42 --> 2366.88]  So Kyle goes to the Asianist guy.
[2367.08 --> 2367.26]  Yeah.
[2367.34 --> 2369.02]  And I go to the whitest guy.
[2369.18 --> 2369.54]  Kindness.
[2370.48 --> 2371.00]  Kindness.
[2372.34 --> 2372.82]  Kindness.
[2377.24 --> 2378.28]  Oh my goodness.
[2378.28 --> 2381.50]  So if we're to believe Google about this.
[2382.66 --> 2383.04]  Oh yeah.
[2383.84 --> 2384.70]  Chat's blowing up.
[2384.80 --> 2385.76]  Go go team Firefox.
[2385.98 --> 2388.56]  If only Firefox wasn't trash right now.
[2388.66 --> 2388.98]  Right.
[2389.18 --> 2389.34]  What?
[2389.44 --> 2389.66]  Okay.
[2389.74 --> 2392.40]  I used to, I had a Firefox plushie thing.
[2392.40 --> 2395.80]  You had a Firefox hard-on so big.
[2395.84 --> 2396.02]  Yeah.
[2396.12 --> 2398.38]  That sometimes we couldn't get this table to sit level.
[2398.56 --> 2398.62]  Yeah.
[2399.00 --> 2402.84]  Like if we talked about Firefox, it'd be like, well, from his side though.
[2402.94 --> 2406.00]  I used it, but I wasn't like, oh, Firefox.
[2406.36 --> 2406.80]  Oh yeah.
[2407.00 --> 2408.52]  I did like wild amounts of testing.
[2408.80 --> 2409.70]  I had some like.
[2409.92 --> 2410.60]  You were on nightly.
[2411.14 --> 2414.44]  Really enjoyable nights with Firefox.
[2414.44 --> 2421.74]  But the problem came down to when it would crash so much that it was directly negatively
[2421.74 --> 2422.96]  impacting my work.
[2423.24 --> 2423.50]  Yeah.
[2423.60 --> 2425.24]  That's where the line was kind of drawn.
[2425.32 --> 2429.26]  That's when you switched to Chrome was not until like quite a bit post LMG, like two years
[2429.26 --> 2429.46]  in.
[2429.60 --> 2429.80]  Yeah.
[2429.94 --> 2434.34]  And like I stopped doing the nightly stuff on computers that I did work stuff on, which
[2434.34 --> 2435.64]  was all my computers.
[2435.80 --> 2437.42]  But like I stopped doing the nightly stuff.
[2437.52 --> 2438.30]  I brought it back.
[2438.36 --> 2441.20]  I started doing the consumer builds when I was like, okay, I can't handle this anymore.
[2441.20 --> 2445.52]  But for a long time, even on the nightly builds, it was rock solid.
[2445.52 --> 2445.86]  You mean on the right.
[2445.96 --> 2446.52]  Oh, on the nightly.
[2446.52 --> 2446.70]  Yeah.
[2446.82 --> 2447.40]  No, I know.
[2447.78 --> 2448.64]  It was rock solid.
[2448.64 --> 2450.38]  I wasn't on nightly, but I was usually on beta.
[2451.24 --> 2451.50]  Yeah.
[2451.92 --> 2452.50]  And like.
[2452.50 --> 2453.34]  But it was fine.
[2453.34 --> 2453.42]  It was fine.
[2453.42 --> 2454.22]  For a long time.
[2454.48 --> 2457.92]  And like you'd have your weird crash every once in a blue moon.
[2458.02 --> 2458.32]  Yeah.
[2458.42 --> 2459.94]  And you're like, I'm on the beta one.
[2460.14 --> 2460.78]  That's fine.
[2460.86 --> 2460.98]  Yeah.
[2460.98 --> 2463.98]  Let me send in my crash report and try to be helpful and then I'll bring everything back
[2463.98 --> 2464.16]  up.
[2464.18 --> 2464.52]  It's fine.
[2465.06 --> 2466.62]  And people say quantum came up.
[2466.84 --> 2466.98]  Yeah.
[2467.06 --> 2467.84]  Quantum came out.
[2467.84 --> 2471.24]  And I like on stream was like, let's do it.
[2471.24 --> 2473.86]  And switched to quantum and was like, I'm really excited.
[2473.94 --> 2474.70]  I'm coming back.
[2474.74 --> 2479.20]  And then that same day within a couple hours of using the browser, it just completely locked
[2479.20 --> 2479.44]  up.
[2479.54 --> 2480.90]  And I lost it.
[2480.96 --> 2483.24]  I was like, no, I can't.
[2483.64 --> 2485.96]  I work so much stuff is browser based these days.
[2485.96 --> 2486.42]  Like.
[2487.20 --> 2488.62]  So here's the thing.
[2488.68 --> 2491.08]  According to Google, they're doing this for.
[2491.30 --> 2492.52]  Do I understand this correctly?
[2492.52 --> 2496.64]  Uh, improvements to security, privacy, performance, and.
[2496.86 --> 2497.36]  Yeah, sure.
[2497.48 --> 2498.76]  To enhance user control.
[2499.24 --> 2500.30]  You know what I think?
[2500.38 --> 2500.60]  Improving.
[2500.60 --> 2503.38]  I think this really does help with user control.
[2504.52 --> 2509.46]  Whenever we want to improve user control at my company, we just lock out options.
[2510.12 --> 2512.62]  We just take control away.
[2512.78 --> 2515.28]  So ridiculous that they're saying security and privacy.
[2515.30 --> 2517.48]  We're enhancing our control of the user.
[2517.48 --> 2522.82]  User should have increased control over their extensions?
[2523.10 --> 2526.84]  The design document says, go ahead, please finish that sentence.
[2527.04 --> 2531.36]  A user should be able to determine what information is available to an extension and be able to
[2531.36 --> 2532.48]  control that privilege.
[2533.70 --> 2534.02]  Okay.
[2534.18 --> 2538.50]  So this involves to achieve these goals, they want to replace web request, the web request
[2538.50 --> 2541.12]  API with a new one, declarative net request.
[2541.44 --> 2546.16]  And the web request API is what allows browser extensions to intercept network requests so they
[2546.16 --> 2548.28]  can be blocked, modified, or redirected.
[2548.64 --> 2552.50]  So this can cause delays in web page loading because Chrome has to wait for the extension.
[2552.86 --> 2553.10]  Okay.
[2553.42 --> 2553.68]  Okay.
[2553.80 --> 2554.38]  Fair enough.
[2554.76 --> 2560.06]  So in the future, web request will only be able to read network requests, not modify them.
[2560.52 --> 2564.58]  The declarative net request will allow Chrome, or rather extensions, to decide how to handle
[2564.58 --> 2568.08]  network requests, thereby removing the mechanism used by some ad blockers.
[2568.14 --> 2571.18]  So interestingly, this isn't in my notes, so I might get it wrong.
[2571.18 --> 2573.78]  So please feel free to correct me, Chad, if I'm wrong here.
[2574.40 --> 2580.62]  But interestingly, ad block plus, which is the one that kind of plays ball with the ad
[2580.62 --> 2584.80]  servers, looks to not be affected by this change.
[2584.80 --> 2584.96]  Oh.
[2584.96 --> 2587.90]  How very, you know what's really interesting?
[2592.98 --> 2597.32]  So I love Google as much as anyone whose entire livelihood is dependent on them.
[2600.20 --> 2601.28]  But you know what?
[2601.60 --> 2605.68]  I really don't think they actually have their users' best interests at heart here.
[2605.88 --> 2606.18]  No.
[2608.04 --> 2609.40]  With all of that said.
[2609.40 --> 2609.72]  Okay.
[2609.88 --> 2610.52]  So the, sorry.
[2610.92 --> 2611.58]  Yeah, go ahead.
[2611.90 --> 2616.00]  The biggest problem that I have with it personally is the improved security and privacy thing.
[2616.54 --> 2616.70]  Yeah.
[2616.76 --> 2620.18]  I mean, if you're going to just, if you're going to do it, just be open about it.
[2620.36 --> 2620.56]  Yeah.
[2620.84 --> 2621.66]  That's my issue.
[2621.72 --> 2621.88]  Yeah.
[2622.06 --> 2626.96]  And like my problem is now people are going to think that having an ad blocker reduces
[2626.96 --> 2629.72]  your security and privacy when it's like literally the other way around.
[2629.82 --> 2635.44]  Because the issue here is that it's not like I don't support organizations getting paid
[2635.44 --> 2637.40]  through ads for the work they do online.
[2637.62 --> 2637.86]  Hello.
[2637.86 --> 2643.06]  And like it bugs me slightly internally when people run ad block on the forum.
[2643.18 --> 2647.60]  Because all our ads on the forum are like as clean as you could possibly have them.
[2647.74 --> 2649.98]  And it's like actually a really good experience.
[2650.18 --> 2652.40]  It's like actually not a problem.
[2652.80 --> 2653.90]  There's no video ones.
[2654.10 --> 2655.46]  They're all groomed.
[2655.82 --> 2657.14]  Like everything's fine.
[2657.36 --> 2659.34]  This is a PIA ad that we put up.
[2659.58 --> 2661.34]  There's nothing funky going on with it.
[2661.76 --> 2662.74]  Like everything's okay.
[2662.74 --> 2663.02]  There's like nothing.
[2663.02 --> 2669.94]  There's like promotion for like tech linked videos and like LTT videos and stuff.
[2670.02 --> 2671.36]  Like that's actually it.
[2671.68 --> 2672.16]  Don't click on a thread.
[2672.86 --> 2674.18]  No, I can click on this.
[2674.26 --> 2674.44]  Yes.
[2674.52 --> 2675.14]  But not on a thread.
[2675.26 --> 2675.40]  Yeah.
[2675.56 --> 2676.06]  So we can go.
[2676.10 --> 2677.06]  Just because you're on your admin account.
[2677.10 --> 2677.46]  Yeah, I know.
[2677.52 --> 2678.02]  See what's in.
[2678.14 --> 2680.40]  So we've got like one Newegg banner.
[2680.52 --> 2681.10]  Oh heavens.
[2681.40 --> 2681.80]  And it's.
[2681.90 --> 2683.84]  Oh, and one Amazon banner at the bottom.
[2683.88 --> 2685.14]  And those are all fine.
[2685.24 --> 2688.74]  So like it kind of makes me sad when people turn that off because we do need to.
[2688.74 --> 2690.94]  We don't even do like the top one that everyone does.
[2690.98 --> 2694.06]  No, a lot of people do top ones that are like half your screen these days.
[2694.06 --> 2694.16]  Yeah.
[2694.76 --> 2697.46]  So like I totally understand why you want it on on some websites.
[2697.60 --> 2703.32]  I know Imgur, Imgur, whatever has had a lot of malicious ads on their site.
[2703.38 --> 2705.98]  And there are a lot of malicious ads out there that have like.
[2706.26 --> 2706.54]  Totally.
[2706.68 --> 2708.98]  Injections and like all this other like terrible stuff.
[2709.12 --> 2709.60]  Or that just.
[2709.72 --> 2710.44]  I completely understand why you might have it.
[2710.44 --> 2711.22]  Track who you are.
[2711.48 --> 2711.66]  Yeah.
[2711.66 --> 2718.24]  Like one really good one is logging your IP when you click on an image so that you can be exploited later.
[2718.38 --> 2718.92]  Like it's just.
[2719.14 --> 2719.24]  Yeah.
[2719.32 --> 2721.52]  Like there are terrible things that ads do.
[2721.60 --> 2723.78]  I completely understand why you would want an ad blocker.
[2724.14 --> 2726.86]  I do wish it was certain websites were white listed sometimes.
[2726.86 --> 2732.32]  But like saying that your security is improved by removing ad blockers is asinine.
[2732.56 --> 2738.28]  Because there are tons of security problems that come with malicious ads that are all over the internet.
[2738.28 --> 2743.30]  So like if Google were to just say we're doing this because a big part of our business is serving ads online.
[2743.44 --> 2746.34]  And quite frankly we think people blocking ads sucks.
[2746.96 --> 2748.24]  Then I'd be like okay.
[2749.04 --> 2749.34]  Fine.
[2749.72 --> 2751.14]  Honestly I can kind of get behind that.
[2751.16 --> 2752.66]  This will reopen the browser wars.
[2752.66 --> 2755.48]  But I think that needs to happen anyways.
[2755.72 --> 2755.74]  That's probably a good thing.
[2755.74 --> 2755.78]  Yeah.
[2755.90 --> 2756.62]  That's a good thing.
[2756.72 --> 2756.86]  Yeah.
[2758.42 --> 2759.72]  But they're not doing that.
[2760.20 --> 2760.36]  No.
[2760.54 --> 2762.36]  I hope it reopens the browser wars anyways.
[2762.54 --> 2763.70]  In other fascinating news.
[2763.70 --> 2772.22]  The lawsuit against AMD for allegedly misrepresenting how many cores their processor has has been allowed to continue.
[2772.40 --> 2774.66]  So those of you who remember Bulldozer.
[2774.82 --> 2775.76]  Oh poor Bulldozer.
[2775.76 --> 2783.76]  Will also remember that each module had two integer processors and then one shared floating point scheduler.
[2783.76 --> 2793.38]  So basically in a traditional sense you'd have both an integer unit and a floating point unit per core.
[2793.72 --> 2800.28]  But AMD was sharing their floating point resources between two integer units or whatever the ratio was.
[2800.94 --> 2802.76]  Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
[2802.76 --> 2814.22]  Anyway the point is that a lot of the time the line between what makes an individual core and what makes two cores has been a little bit blurry.
[2814.36 --> 2818.38]  Because in the old days you wouldn't have things like a shared cache between two cores.
[2818.62 --> 2819.88]  But now you do.
[2820.52 --> 2825.44]  So AMD said it was going to share instruction fetch and decode stages.
[2825.66 --> 2827.66]  Floating point units and the level two cache.
[2827.66 --> 2829.64]  Between two cores.
[2830.26 --> 2834.30]  And then blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
[2835.34 --> 2840.40]  So someone pointed out to best account of the company saying its own integer execution pipeline qualifies as a core.
[2840.52 --> 2843.60]  If only because most processor workloads emphasize integer math.
[2843.60 --> 2846.88]  So that's why they figured having two integer units made it two cores.
[2847.04 --> 2855.32]  Even though they were sharing components that would have traditionally and indeed have continued to be seen as necessary for a single processor core.
[2855.32 --> 2859.70]  So there's a class action lawsuit that's probably not going anywhere for being honest.
[2859.86 --> 2863.06]  Where people are saying AMD misled the public.
[2863.20 --> 2867.70]  Calling it at their FX processors eight core CPUs.
[2867.78 --> 2871.40]  Because of the shared resources between cores and bulldozer modules.
[2872.04 --> 2875.00]  The lawsuit alleges the claim was deceptive about real world performance.
[2875.00 --> 2881.48]  The issue here is that saying how many cores a CPU has doesn't say anything about real world performance.
[2881.60 --> 2886.72]  What are you going to go complain that an Atom processor with four cores is deceptive about its real world performance?
[2887.08 --> 2888.52]  No it's still an Atom processor.
[2888.94 --> 2891.74]  And AMD bulldozer cores were still crappy cores.
[2892.22 --> 2895.26]  Like if you looked at any benchmark ever you'd know that.
[2895.52 --> 2899.66]  Although for some reason AMD fanboys were like they had like this amazing blind spot.
[2899.66 --> 2901.76]  It looked a little something like this.
[2901.82 --> 2902.60]  Ugggh.
[2902.72 --> 2903.80]  La la la.
[2904.28 --> 2905.70]  La la la la.
[2905.70 --> 2907.28]  It's still good enough for gaming.
[2907.40 --> 2908.58]  La la la la.
[2908.66 --> 2910.78]  Look at this two workloads that it's really good at.
[2910.86 --> 2911.52]  La la la.
[2912.46 --> 2914.34]  It happens like every time though.
[2914.42 --> 2918.54]  And it's so funny because they come after me they're like oh yeah now that Ryzen's out.
[2918.68 --> 2921.46]  You're like now you're on the AMD because.
[2921.74 --> 2922.00]  No.
[2922.32 --> 2924.58]  And you were you were at Intel fanboy now you're this.
[2924.68 --> 2925.10]  Like no.
[2925.32 --> 2925.72]  64.
[2926.08 --> 2928.16]  It's because the situation changed.
[2928.24 --> 2928.42]  Yeah.
[2928.42 --> 2931.70]  There's no such thing as being on a team or not on a team.
[2931.82 --> 2933.62]  It's a processor.
[2933.88 --> 2934.56]  Get the better one.
[2934.60 --> 2935.26]  Who cares.
[2935.48 --> 2936.62]  Get the better one.
[2937.18 --> 2937.48]  Ugh.
[2937.90 --> 2939.42]  Anyway I'm probably not going anywhere.
[2940.70 --> 2945.40]  The judge did reject AMD's request to dismiss the lawsuit so it'll proceed but it's not going anywhere.
[2947.34 --> 2951.44]  Facebook got caught writing fake Amazon reviews for the portal.
[2952.24 --> 2952.86]  Kind of silly.
[2952.86 --> 2958.12]  Apparently employees were caught leaving five star reviews on Amazon for the portal video chat device.
[2958.42 --> 2963.52]  New York Times reporters noticed reviews were being left by people with the same names as Facebook employees.
[2964.20 --> 2967.30]  And apparently Facebook.
[2967.74 --> 2968.30]  Was it Facebook?
[2970.70 --> 2971.72]  Employees had not been.
[2971.88 --> 2976.56]  Facebook says employees had not been instructed to leave good reviews and they are asking them to take them down.
[2976.56 --> 2977.04]  So.
[2978.04 --> 2978.56]  Sure.
[2983.26 --> 2983.62]  Boy.
[2984.68 --> 2986.34]  Can they do anything right lately?
[2986.66 --> 2987.24]  It's like having a.
[2987.24 --> 2988.18]  You know what else they're doing?
[2988.42 --> 2988.58]  The.
[2989.42 --> 2989.86]  Yeah.
[2990.06 --> 2990.90]  Messaging integration.
[2991.06 --> 2991.90]  Is that where you're going?
[2991.92 --> 2992.20]  No.
[2992.20 --> 2992.90]  Oh.
[2993.24 --> 2997.36]  They're integrating Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger into one messaging service.
[2999.18 --> 3000.96]  They said they were going to leave them alone.
[3001.00 --> 3002.00]  That doesn't seem like a good idea at all.
[3002.14 --> 3004.16]  It seems like a terrible idea.
[3004.38 --> 3004.70]  Yeah.
[3005.24 --> 3008.14]  I don't think WhatsApp users are going to enjoy that remotely.
[3008.98 --> 3014.14]  Half the reason that people are on Instagram is because they don't want to hear from their grandma on Facebook Messenger.
[3014.14 --> 3017.42]  But no, they will be intercompatible according to TechLink.
[3017.44 --> 3019.22]  I think that's going to really hurt Instagram.
[3019.40 --> 3019.62]  Yeah.
[3019.70 --> 3021.08]  I think so too.
[3021.78 --> 3025.40]  Although I guess you could probably have like non-linked accounts, you know.
[3026.10 --> 3026.88]  I guess.
[3027.26 --> 3027.86]  But still.
[3028.06 --> 3028.30]  Oof.
[3029.84 --> 3031.22]  That's not a great idea.
[3031.46 --> 3032.66]  There's some other Facebook news.
[3032.78 --> 3034.40]  Apparently Zuckerberg did something terrible again.
[3034.46 --> 3035.94]  I don't remember what it is though and it's not in here.
[3036.50 --> 3036.90]  Okay.
[3037.04 --> 3038.24]  Well, I've had enough.
[3039.00 --> 3042.64]  Oh, there's a reminder in here for me to read some super chats.
[3042.64 --> 3042.70]  Yes.
[3043.38 --> 3045.96]  Can we please get PewDiePie on Floatplane?
[3046.08 --> 3047.44]  It would be free marketing for you.
[3047.50 --> 3047.90]  Trust me.
[3047.98 --> 3048.94]  We'd love to.
[3049.54 --> 3053.88]  I have never even met Felix, let alone pitched him coming on Floatplane.
[3055.20 --> 3056.34]  So, yeah.
[3056.48 --> 3058.94]  Best of luck to you with that and me.
[3058.96 --> 3059.16]  Thanks, man.
[3059.48 --> 3059.66]  Thanks.
[3059.66 --> 3060.58]  Thank you, Van.
[3061.74 --> 3067.06]  Hunter says, also my profile pic was the first PC I ever built six to seven years ago with your help.
[3067.06 --> 3070.00]  I think I missed your first message, Hunter, but thank you.
[3071.44 --> 3072.30]  What else we got?
[3072.58 --> 3072.94]  Hunter.
[3073.14 --> 3073.30]  Oh.
[3074.24 --> 3074.86]  Hey, Linus.
[3074.90 --> 3081.38]  Just want to let you guys know I'm going after a business information system degree right now because years ago you guys created a passion in tech for me.
[3081.64 --> 3083.24]  So here is 10 bucks for being awesome.
[3083.34 --> 3083.88]  Well, thank you.
[3084.60 --> 3090.96]  Drake says, life and I are thinking of coming up from the States to LTX, but I need a dinner recommendation to make up for dragging her along.
[3091.34 --> 3094.60]  I've seen Stephanie's post about places to visit, but what would Linus do?
[3094.60 --> 3097.88]  Oh, I am the worst person to ask about like where to go.
[3097.94 --> 3098.14]  Sorry?
[3098.36 --> 3098.86]  Banana Leaf.
[3098.86 --> 3099.22]  Oh, yeah.
[3099.24 --> 3099.98]  You can go to Banana Leaf.
[3100.66 --> 3100.86]  Yeah.
[3100.90 --> 3101.76]  Check out that Banana Leaf.
[3101.90 --> 3103.94]  What's that Thai place you really like too?
[3104.00 --> 3104.42]  Thai by Thai?
[3105.54 --> 3106.18]  That's in Surrey.
[3106.28 --> 3106.84]  That's in Surrey?
[3106.94 --> 3107.38]  Oh, forget it.
[3107.40 --> 3107.78]  Don't go to that one.
[3107.78 --> 3108.58]  We're doing Richmond places?
[3108.58 --> 3109.72]  There's a really good place.
[3110.22 --> 3112.04]  There's a really good Thai place downtown.
[3112.20 --> 3112.44]  Salatai.
[3112.44 --> 3113.30]  Salatai is really good too.
[3113.64 --> 3113.88]  There.
[3114.04 --> 3114.28]  Okay.
[3114.74 --> 3115.98]  I'd go to Banana Leaf though.
[3116.22 --> 3116.98]  Go to Banana Leaf.
[3117.12 --> 3121.70]  Get the, if you like seafood, the abundance of seafood and gulai sauce or something like
[3121.70 --> 3121.82]  that.
[3121.86 --> 3122.88]  I don't even like seafood.
[3123.08 --> 3123.56]  If you're in-
[3123.56 --> 3124.26]  That dish is amazing.
[3124.26 --> 3126.64]  If you're in Richmond and you like barbecue, go to Hog Shack.
[3128.12 --> 3129.72]  Race Geek Birch.
[3129.76 --> 3129.90]  Hello.
[3130.02 --> 3132.08]  I have a new PC and I'm struggling with my recordings.
[3132.22 --> 3133.60]  Doesn't matter what I do to bit rate.
[3133.70 --> 3134.74]  It still gets choppy footage.
[3134.82 --> 3136.76]  9,900K with a 1070 Ti?
[3137.82 --> 3138.76]  And coding speed.
[3139.76 --> 3140.12]  Yeah.
[3141.50 --> 3146.44]  Even, even, no matter what your CPU is, you can't go like slowest.
[3146.62 --> 3146.88]  Yeah.
[3147.38 --> 3148.86]  So just try like fast or very fast.
[3148.86 --> 3152.70]  I would, just because it's not working right now, jump to very fast first and then try to
[3152.70 --> 3154.10]  dial it up from there and see how it works.
[3154.88 --> 3158.58]  Fake Dragonite says, you can always count on Linus to class up the show.
[3160.00 --> 3161.36]  You didn't see that part of this.
[3162.04 --> 3163.36]  Sam says, I tried Shadow.
[3163.44 --> 3164.58]  It has a long way to go.
[3164.66 --> 3168.14]  I can see it being useful for cloud computing, but they don't like it for gaming just yet.
[3168.14 --> 3170.66]  So that's a big, your mileage may vary thing.
[3171.32 --> 3175.52]  Down the street, it was great, but I do think, and they acknowledge, they have a lot more
[3175.52 --> 3176.60]  infrastructure to build out.
[3177.92 --> 3180.20]  Jake says, at least it'll be better than Tanacon.
[3181.58 --> 3181.90]  Thanks.
[3181.98 --> 3182.70]  It already has been.
[3183.86 --> 3185.06]  Yeah, that's true, actually.
[3185.20 --> 3188.22]  We did have a, we did follow through on our ball pit commitment the first year.
[3188.56 --> 3190.50]  That was defeating TumblrCon.
[3191.10 --> 3193.04]  David says, hello from Nebraska.
[3193.74 --> 3194.00]  Yeah.
[3194.14 --> 3195.18]  If you have ever heard of it.
[3195.18 --> 3196.38]  I've heard of Nebraska.
[3196.38 --> 3196.50]  Nebraska.
[3197.38 --> 3199.84]  The chick from Big Bang Theory is from Nebraska.
[3200.30 --> 3200.68]  Oh, okay.
[3200.84 --> 3201.00]  Yeah.
[3201.58 --> 3202.96]  It's just in the Americas.
[3203.24 --> 3206.50]  I'll be flying out there with the wife for four days.
[3206.84 --> 3208.94]  First two for her, last two for me.
[3209.18 --> 3210.42]  Brandon's turning our lights off.
[3210.50 --> 3212.58]  Also says, my wife is used to your voice.
[3213.84 --> 3214.28]  Hassan.
[3214.66 --> 3217.00]  Hassan says, can't come to LTX, but want to support.
[3217.16 --> 3217.34]  Wow.
[3217.42 --> 3218.50]  Thank you, Hassan.
[3218.52 --> 3218.92]  Thank you.
[3220.16 --> 3221.86]  Soko says, love the show.
[3221.94 --> 3223.18]  Just turned 18 two hours ago.
[3223.18 --> 3227.18]  Happy birthday and already having all kinds of existential crises.
[3227.44 --> 3228.76]  Is this what adulthood is like?
[3228.82 --> 3229.92]  Oh, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[3229.98 --> 3230.72]  Wait till you turn 30.
[3231.00 --> 3231.14]  Yeah.
[3231.52 --> 3232.68]  And I'm sure it gets worse.
[3233.18 --> 3236.36]  Mikel says, just wanted to say, why did you open the red?
[3236.52 --> 3237.62]  For God's sake.
[3238.06 --> 3240.12]  That camera's like the value of my car.
[3240.48 --> 3241.62]  Please finish that video.
[3241.82 --> 3242.78]  You have a pretty expensive car.
[3242.78 --> 3243.78]  Yeah.
[3246.20 --> 3246.80]  You know what I mean?
[3247.08 --> 3248.42]  Apparently our roast is really good.
[3248.48 --> 3249.56]  I actually haven't tried it yet.
[3250.04 --> 3251.36]  A bunch of people tried it.
[3251.44 --> 3251.70]  Nice.
[3251.80 --> 3254.42]  So there's like an LTT roast that lined this hasn't tried,
[3254.52 --> 3256.10]  but like everyone else here has tried.
[3257.88 --> 3258.28]  Okay.
[3258.46 --> 3261.60]  So I opened the red to see what would happen.
[3267.12 --> 3268.74]  What do you people want from me?
[3268.74 --> 3274.98]  Were you really expecting a different answer?
[3276.36 --> 3279.90]  The best part is because I forgot to do like a before thermals test.
[3280.18 --> 3283.44]  I have to put it back together, do a bunch of testing,
[3283.66 --> 3287.52]  then take it apart again, then work on measuring for blocks,
[3288.06 --> 3292.38]  then put it back together again, probably to like test fit,
[3292.48 --> 3293.22]  then take it apart.
[3293.38 --> 3294.74]  Then like...
[3294.74 --> 3296.72]  What percentage chance do you think it'll work at the end of it?
[3298.58 --> 3298.86]  40?
[3300.60 --> 3302.84]  And I'm happy with that as long as we get content out of it
[3302.84 --> 3303.84]  at each stage along the way.
[3304.24 --> 3306.46]  I think your wife is going to murder you if we don't...
[3306.46 --> 3308.50]  Oh yeah, we have to go to badminton tonight, don't we?
[3308.60 --> 3309.24]  What time does it start?
[3310.70 --> 3311.54]  Oh, but we need dinner.
[3312.68 --> 3313.46]  Okay, we should go.
[3313.90 --> 3314.66]  Okay, bye everyone!
[3314.98 --> 3315.26]  Bye!
[3315.26 --> 3315.54]  Bye!
[3319.22 --> 3319.82]  This? Why?
[3320.58 --> 3321.14]  Oh, you're cheating.
[3321.58 --> 3322.18]  Yeah, no, I'm not.
[3323.16 --> 3323.74]  Oh, I am.
[3324.12 --> 3324.72]  But...
[3324.74 --> 3325.50]  No, I'm not.
[3325.60 --> 3325.80]  Sorry.
[3326.20 --> 3326.52]  Hold on.
[3326.90 --> 3328.44]  It's easier if you tell me now why.
[3330.54 --> 3331.20]  Oh, okay.
