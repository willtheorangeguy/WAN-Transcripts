[0.00 → 5.52] All right, it's WAN Showtime again, ladies and gentlemen.
[6.72 → 9.96] Hope you've all had a fantastic week.
[10.86 → 19.20] Beautiful, gorgeous Halloween full of beautiful, gorgeous, you know, costumes of monsters that are at your house.
[19.36 → 20.04] We're talking about children.
[22.28 → 24.86] We're off to a bad start on the WAN Show today.
[25.00 → 27.90] Fortunately, we weren't planning to talk about Halloween today.
[27.90 → 31.64] We've got a bunch of other great topics for you, including YouTube P-scores.
[32.36 → 36.30] Did you know that my P-score is bigger than most people's P-scores?
[36.30 → 37.64] It's in the top 10 P-scores.
[37.76 → 39.40] Yeah, yeah, top 10 P-scores.
[39.76 → 42.02] I have a bigger P-score than Will Smith.
[42.62 → 46.42] So we'll explain what exactly I'm talking about in a little bit.
[46.52 → 48.50] We're also going to talk about Google buying Fitbit.
[49.16 → 49.82] Very interesting.
[49.98 → 50.62] About time.
[51.64 → 53.84] Would you watch Netflix at 2x?
[53.94 → 56.94] Oh, wow, that's going to be a conversation and a half.
[56.94 → 57.90] I know.
[58.06 → 60.40] We should invite David and Brandon over here.
[61.38 → 62.66] That'd be terrible.
[64.14 → 64.88] Roll the intro.
[65.26 → 66.02] Yeah, let's just.
[66.72 → 67.06] I can't wait.
[67.06 → 67.70] Whoops, wrong one.
[73.58 → 76.08] Sir Chicken says, I thought P-scores were fun.
[76.08 → 77.10] Oh, my.
[77.28 → 78.04] She doesn't see you.
[80.78 → 81.30] What?
[81.40 → 82.22] I was talking about C-score.
[82.22 → 87.74] It's her company.
[88.44 → 89.70] How would she not know it's real?
[89.70 → 95.38] You successfully cleaned the whole bowl.
[95.38 → 98.68] All right.
[99.00 → 104.72] For the last month, a handful of creators have been probing the HTML code of YouTube videos.
[104.84 → 109.72] Like when you right-click in your browser and hit inspect, you can see the HTML from whatever page you're on.
[110.06 → 113.54] And for the last month, around, what was it, October 8th or something?
[113.54 → 117.28] YouTube exposed some new HTML that wasn't there before.
[117.92 → 122.14] And it says all these funky things like what the video's P-score is.
[122.26 → 122.42] Yeah.
[122.42 → 128.08] And then so they went ham with that, and they looked at the P-scores of many different channels and videos.
[128.30 → 128.46] Yeah.
[128.60 → 131.62] And then they made all of this kind of assumptions about what that could mean.
[131.86 → 133.10] And they're freaking out.
[134.38 → 135.98] And I don't know how I feel about it.
[136.38 → 142.00] So basically, there's actually, there are a couple of pretty good articles about it.
[142.00 → 146.18] The one that I've got on my screen here is from medium.com.
[146.92 → 148.84] And I'm just going to see if I, yeah, here we go.
[148.90 → 154.14] So here's an example of what to inspect source code looked like.
[154.18 → 155.40] So channel P-score.
[155.56 → 162.34] And this is like, we're talking pretty granular scoring of an entire channel.
[162.50 → 164.96] Like we're talking, what is this called?
[165.12 → 166.18] You know, five?
[168.20 → 168.98] The precision?
[169.14 → 169.38] I know.
[169.48 → 170.64] You're thinking of sig figs.
[170.64 → 173.92] I'm thinking of like metal, you know, when like a metal is super pure.
[174.00 → 176.04] You talk about how it's like two nines or three nines.
[176.26 → 178.56] But this is like that, but not that at all.
[178.64 → 178.92] You know what?
[178.96 → 179.28] Forget it.
[179.30 → 179.48] Whatever.
[179.58 → 185.26] The point is, they're basically, they've got such a degree of granularity in the way that
[185.26 → 190.70] they are quantifying what a channel's P-score is that out of one, two, three, how many places
[190.70 → 191.10] is this?
[191.22 → 199.50] You know, 86 million channels, you know, a 0.00001 difference between them could give one a higher
[199.50 → 200.86] P-score and one a lower P-score.
[200.86 → 205.84] So clearly that means they're taking a lot of factors into consideration here.
[205.84 → 209.32] And this is another fascinating piece.
[209.32 → 220.02] So this was data gathered by Baobab, Nicol ares Doris, Optimum, and Josh Precatory of 10 top
[220.02 → 225.76] YouTubers P-scores based on a randomly selected data set of large YouTubers.
[225.76 → 231.12] Now, admittedly, this was only out of 200 YouTubers.
[231.76 → 239.22] So when I show up on the top 10 of the top 10 YouTubers P-scores, right there.
[239.54 → 240.30] Yeah, that's right.
[240.58 → 242.20] Where's BBC News at now?
[242.50 → 243.90] Where's Will Smith at now?
[244.54 → 245.16] That's right.
[245.60 → 246.80] Linus Tech Tips, yo.
[247.50 → 252.48] Mind you, I mean, Jimmy Fallon is like, you know, way better than me apparently, which,
[252.48 → 254.70] you know, I guess I'll have to learn to live with.
[255.86 → 260.08] But to be clear, we already knew that P-scores existed.
[260.82 → 262.84] It's not controversial that P-scores existed.
[263.52 → 266.32] We just didn't know what the numbers were.
[266.62 → 268.62] YouTube doesn't tell you what your number is.
[269.62 → 271.94] Which is for obvious, like, defensible reasons.
[272.48 → 277.82] Google never wants to expose, like, how their black magic works because then people can exploit
[277.82 → 278.72] it and game the system.
[278.88 → 279.64] And they don't want to do that.
[279.74 → 280.20] So it's hidden.
[280.20 → 288.22] So basically what we know about the P-score is that it seems to dictate whether
[288.22 → 295.14] content is surfaced in YouTube's Google preferred lineup, which is the advertiser-friendly, vetted,
[295.38 → 297.04] high-quality content.
[297.22 → 302.14] I'm using finger quotes even though I personally think Will Smith is a national treasure and
[302.14 → 304.70] is absolutely vetted in high quality in every way on YouTube.
[304.70 → 308.22] And I definitely support his YouTube career.
[308.22 → 313.80] The point is that there's this thing called the Google preferred lineup, which is a select
[313.80 → 315.78] set of YouTubers.
[315.78 → 323.20] where if you're a big brand, remember, Apocalypse happened in 2018 where a bunch of big brands
[323.20 → 326.74] decided we're not going to advertise on YouTube anymore because our product is being advertised
[326.74 → 327.60] in front of ISIS.
[328.02 → 332.52] Or content, not just ISIS, content that we don't want our brand associated with.
[332.58 → 332.74] Right.
[332.74 → 337.26] That's a better sort of overarching way to put it.
[337.38 → 339.36] So they made this short list of creators who are safe.
[339.50 → 343.28] So if you're a Coca-Cola, and you're like, look, just put me in front of something safe,
[343.98 → 344.94] now they have this list.
[345.16 → 349.74] But naturally, they needed some kind of automated system that would make this list.
[349.82 → 352.78] Well, Google preferred has actually existed for a lot longer than that.
[352.78 → 353.78] So we were added to Google preferred.
[353.78 → 354.22] I believe 2013.
[354.66 → 354.82] Yeah.
[354.98 → 357.44] We were added to Google preferred back when they launched it.
[357.48 → 360.14] And that was early on in the days of Linus Media Group.
[360.64 → 366.82] The thing, though, is that Google preferred and YouTube is always sort of obfuscating things
[366.82 → 367.26] more.
[367.68 → 373.00] In the early days of Google preferred, you could see not just who was in Google preferred,
[373.44 → 376.72] but you could actually see a breakdown of just how preferred you were.
[376.72 → 377.22] Oh, wow.
[377.34 → 382.16] So I was in top 1% Google preferred in the technology category specifically.
[383.48 → 386.88] So Google preferred as a whole is 5% of the creators?
[387.12 → 387.58] It was.
[387.70 → 388.40] Well, they have two.
[388.68 → 389.96] Well, see, this is the thing.
[390.20 → 395.80] This is information that we wouldn't have if they hadn't originally exposed it to us.
[395.80 → 399.70] But at least at one point, though I don't know that it works this way anymore, they had
[399.70 → 401.72] a top 1% and a top 5%.
[402.24 → 406.16] And so, for example, Linus Tech Tips was a top 1% channel.
[406.16 → 408.82] Probably by merit of its size.
[409.34 → 415.08] And Tech Quickie was a top 5% channel, probably by merit of its lesser size.
[416.26 → 422.76] So what it seems like to me is that instead of just having like a 1% preferred and a 5%
[422.76 → 430.54] preferred, now this P score is a much more granular way of determining just how safe and
[430.54 → 437.42] how advertiser friendly and how non-controversial that channel as a whole is likely to be.
[437.42 → 440.22] And it's based on five dimensions, apparently.
[440.46 → 442.90] There's popularity, which is the size that you were talking about.
[443.08 → 444.80] And that's driven by watch time and engagement.
[445.48 → 448.00] There's passion, which is mostly channel engagement.
[448.26 → 451.94] Apparently, there's protection, which ensures the content is appropriate.
[452.32 → 456.82] Platform, which highlights content often watched on TV screens, which is the market that
[456.82 → 459.48] they want to grow into, and production values.
[460.16 → 461.72] How do you quantify something?
[461.86 → 464.72] Sorry, Jack asked me to turn my hat around, so I will oblige.
[465.74 → 467.80] LTTstore.com, we've got a new hat.
[467.86 → 469.74] I was waiting for someone to ask me to turn my hat around.
[469.74 → 470.92] Dot com, com, com.
[471.00 → 471.48] Pow, pow, pow.
[471.64 → 472.64] Tech-linked hat.
[473.66 → 474.40] Get linked.
[474.78 → 475.06] Oh, right.
[475.12 → 476.30] We have a promo today, too.
[476.76 → 479.92] Buy a tech-linked hat and get free cable ties.
[481.14 → 482.64] We've got to get rid of those cable ties somehow.
[483.82 → 484.14] Enjoy.
[484.14 → 485.86] Bundles, bundles, 3,000.
[486.46 → 487.98] Now I'm going to turn it around one more time.
[488.06 → 488.46] Oh, no.
[488.64 → 489.08] Oh, yeah.
[489.44 → 489.80] He did it.
[489.80 → 491.96] How do you do, fellow school children?
[492.14 → 492.64] I'm insane.
[493.72 → 494.26] All right.
[494.38 → 494.82] So, yeah.
[495.76 → 498.42] How do you measure the production values of a video?
[498.60 → 502.86] That is honestly something that I find kind of difficult to quantify.
[503.00 → 506.46] There are certain things you can, like was it uploaded in 4K, for example.
[506.46 → 508.20] Yeah, you just get a score for each one of those.
[508.26 → 510.24] But you can upload anything in 4K.
[510.34 → 513.62] I mean, this is something I get so tired of explaining to people.
[513.62 → 522.60] 4K is not inherently a measure of a video's crispiness or whatever word you want to use
[522.60 → 523.20] to describe it.
[523.20 → 531.58] Because I could take the most crap garbage footage off of a cell phone from eight years
[531.58 → 531.88] ago.
[531.88 → 537.30] I could throw it in Adobe Premiere and I could export it in 4K, upload it to YouTube.
[537.54 → 541.88] It will look like crap garbage cell phone footage from eight years ago.
[541.88 → 548.92] So, it's the kind of thing that is extraordinarily difficult to measure.
[549.04 → 550.34] I mean, there are certain things you could do.
[550.72 → 557.88] Like, you could use machine learning to scan for things like obvious distracting background
[557.88 → 558.40] noise.
[558.86 → 563.24] You know, like wind blowing through a microphone or something like that.
[563.24 → 565.96] You could probably look at it on a pixel by pixel basis because they do that for other
[565.96 → 566.94] systems that they have.
[567.74 → 569.40] Like their content ID system.
[570.80 → 571.52] That's true.
[571.52 → 586.64] I also do know that for top creators and for preferred, it is shocking how many real actual Google
[586.64 → 589.18] employees watch a video.
[589.88 → 597.54] So, it is possible that part of the production value scoring is handled by actual people.
[597.54 → 602.24] But we don't know because Google is intentionally pretty opaque about the whole thing.
[602.78 → 604.70] But I want to get into the controversial part of this topic.
[605.32 → 608.06] And I want to know your opinion on where you stand because those creators...
[608.06 → 609.16] As someone with a high P score?
[609.54 → 609.90] Just saying.
[609.94 → 611.86] Just saying I've got a huge P score.
[611.88 → 612.60] Is it higher than 15?
[613.18 → 614.08] Huge P score.
[614.26 → 614.36] Yeah.
[614.36 → 614.48] Okay.
[615.54 → 619.72] The creators that are looking through this data, they discovered references to throttling.
[619.98 → 623.78] There's all these tags that involve the word throttling in the source code of these
[623.78 → 624.10] pages.
[624.10 → 628.70] And they believe it could indicate that YouTube is doing two things.
[629.12 → 633.84] One thing called brand safety throttling, which is restricting the video's access or
[633.84 → 635.02] eligibility to ads.
[635.20 → 640.36] So, it's not demonetized where it's not getting any ads put on it, but it's getting fewer ads
[640.36 → 641.40] or a certain type of ads.
[643.24 → 648.20] And then the other thing they think could be happening is what they call feature video throttling,
[648.74 → 651.58] which is just like serving your video to fewer people.
[651.58 → 656.98] But do you think their take on that makes sense?
[658.54 → 666.50] I see the problem for me with a topic like this is it's really hard for me to appear unbiased
[666.50 → 672.42] because my understanding is a P score of above 500 is like pretty decent or 700, I think.
[672.42 → 676.18] Yeah, I think they said 700 to 800 is like you're getting into the Google preferred lineup
[676.18 → 676.40] territory.
[676.40 → 676.62] Okay.
[676.88 → 679.28] So, we're obviously well clear of that.
[679.38 → 681.52] Apparently, our P score is over 1,000.
[682.26 → 682.46] Huge.
[683.52 → 684.20] It's huge.
[684.24 → 684.98] The biggest you've ever seen.
[685.14 → 685.96] It's enormous.
[686.44 → 687.68] It's bigger than Will Smith's.
[688.72 → 689.02] That's going to be...
[689.02 → 693.38] Look, I was bound to beat Will Smith at something once in my life.
[694.48 → 696.30] It looks like this is going to be it.
[696.70 → 697.24] Oh, my God.
[697.24 → 697.74] This is it.
[697.92 → 698.56] I've crested.
[699.20 → 703.94] It's all downhill from here because nobody is going to put the time and effort into, you
[703.94 → 706.08] know, bringing me back to my prime once I'm over the hill.
[706.24 → 706.82] So, this is it.
[706.86 → 707.68] It's all downhill from here.
[707.72 → 712.46] Will Smith, if this makes it to you somehow, can we please, please do a challenge video
[712.46 → 716.30] like an Olympics where you guys do various things and compete?
[716.78 → 717.98] That would be so awesome.
[718.02 → 718.66] There's no way.
[718.76 → 719.30] There's no way.
[719.52 → 720.20] Abington basketball.
[720.60 → 721.24] There's no way.
[721.70 → 722.10] Wrapping.
[722.66 → 723.52] Oh, man.
[724.18 → 726.26] Take that sideways hat off right now.
[728.92 → 729.32] Okay.
[729.50 → 736.04] So, it's going to be hard for me to come across genuine when I say no.
[736.22 → 740.08] I, in fact, do not think that this is as big of a deal as people are making it out to
[740.08 → 746.62] be because I realize I'm speaking from a privileged position where we made a conscious decision
[746.62 → 749.70] back when Linus Media Group was founded seven years ago.
[750.04 → 751.30] Yeah, actually, will it be?
[751.38 → 752.18] Oh, my God.
[752.24 → 754.78] Will it be eight years when the calendar rolls over?
[758.58 → 758.98] Seven.
[759.20 → 759.52] Seven.
[759.64 → 759.82] Okay.
[759.94 → 760.94] I thought I lost a year there.
[761.34 → 765.16] Seven years ago when we founded Linus Media Group, we made a conscious decision to stay
[765.16 → 772.20] pretty family friendly and, by extension, brand and advertiser friendly because when I
[772.20 → 777.38] founded the company, I was in a very precarious position.
[777.54 → 782.04] I only had around 200,000 subscribers on the channel and because I didn't know the first
[782.04 → 788.70] thing about operating a camera or video editing, my intention was to go at it hard.
[789.08 → 790.96] Hire two people immediately.
[790.96 → 794.48] Ed and Luke, and then my wife was also doing some work for us on the side, even though she
[794.48 → 795.78] was supposed to be on her mat leave.
[796.84 → 797.62] Hire Ed and Luke.
[797.88 → 798.62] Go, go, go.
[798.86 → 800.42] And we're just, we're going to pump content.
[800.54 → 802.68] So, Luke, you're going to make sure that we're pumping lots of content.
[802.96 → 806.28] We're going to get, you know, a forum started so we have a backup plan.
[806.64 → 808.10] Ed, you're going to do all the shooting and editing.
[808.24 → 809.10] You can do all that, right?
[809.70 → 818.56] And so I already knew that in order to survive, we were going to have to be able to engage with
[818.56 → 820.54] a wide variety of brands.
[821.30 → 825.34] So I was like, okay, let's say here and now, set it out here and now.
[825.52 → 827.06] We're not going to swear on the channel.
[827.48 → 833.72] Like in my daily life, people often either act or are shocked when they meet me in person
[833.72 → 838.64] and I'm like dropping F-bombs all over the place because they're like, wait, what?
[838.78 → 841.50] Like in real life, I don't really care.
[841.50 → 842.24] He's no saint.
[842.48 → 842.96] I don't care.
[843.44 → 845.10] Like I don't care about cussing.
[845.24 → 846.54] It's not a big deal to me.
[847.12 → 853.32] And in my opinion, as a consumer of content, I don't notice it or care about it.
[853.50 → 860.26] But we made a conscious decision to bleep, to, okay, to A, swear infrequently so that
[860.26 → 863.80] it has a greater effect because that really does matter.
[863.80 → 869.66] I remember the first time I dropped a swear word with my friends in high school because
[869.66 → 871.98] they had known me as like the kid who didn't swear.
[872.34 → 873.94] So I've kind of been all over the place on this issue.
[874.90 → 878.40] It was like, this must have been like very, very important.
[878.56 → 880.84] And then over time, the impact gets lower and lower and lower.
[880.94 → 884.78] So we made this decision to only swear when we felt like we really needed to emphasize
[884.78 → 885.24] something.
[885.42 → 887.42] And two, to bleep it whenever we did it.
[887.44 → 888.46] And that was for two reasons.
[888.46 → 893.96] One, to make sure that we aren't, for no reason, like for what good reason, turning
[893.96 → 894.78] off advertisers.
[895.46 → 898.86] It's just entirely unnecessary to close down.
[899.02 → 904.84] Like as a business owner, it would be irresponsible of me to be like, no, but my free speech, I
[904.84 → 908.72] won't put a beep sound in my video, you know, deal with it.
[908.98 → 909.22] What?
[909.34 → 910.64] No, I'm trying to run a business here.
[910.72 → 912.16] We need like over what?
[912.28 → 913.70] There is some editing overhead.
[914.02 → 914.90] Everyone knows.
[915.06 → 915.88] Yeah, it's not much.
[915.88 → 918.10] Everyone knows what word I was saying.
[918.60 → 921.72] And two, personally, this is very, very personal.
[922.12 → 923.56] Most people probably won't agree.
[924.02 → 926.88] I find swearing much funnier if it's bleeped.
[928.32 → 928.76] Bizarre.
[928.94 → 929.46] I know.
[929.62 → 930.22] That's very bizarre.
[930.38 → 931.74] Please turn your hat a different way.
[931.86 → 932.70] I hate it.
[932.74 → 933.36] I will not.
[933.98 → 934.84] I will not.
[935.10 → 935.70] And I don't care.
[935.70 → 946.54] I have always found, so the first time I ever heard the Uncle Bleeper song from South Park
[946.54 → 946.86] the movie.
[947.20 → 947.50] Okay.
[947.70 → 948.82] The first time I ever heard.
[948.82 → 949.06] Uncle Bleeper.
[949.28 → 949.50] Yeah.
[950.10 → 950.50] Whatever.
[951.76 → 953.62] I don't want this video demonetized, okay?
[953.78 → 956.84] Look, the first time I ever heard the song, it was bleeped.
[957.04 → 959.52] And, but it was not bleeped well.
[960.12 → 963.66] So that's something that I've given a lot of guidance to our editors on over the years.
[963.78 → 966.28] Like, sometimes they'll bleep things too much.
[967.18 → 971.18] One of the most egregious examples of this is the Stormtrooper rap.
[971.72 → 974.08] I did actually rap on the channel once, by the way.
[974.10 → 974.64] That's what I'm saying.
[974.64 → 974.92] Okay.
[975.04 → 981.54] The Stormtrooper rap that we did in our review of the what was this?
[981.64 → 984.16] Streets by 50 headphones.
[985.02 → 988.58] The way that it was bleeped was so bad.
[989.08 → 995.64] It was just, the bleep was over not just the spoken, like, rapping audio track, but over
[995.64 → 997.12] the background music as well.
[998.24 → 1004.02] So it just completely disrupted the song.
[1004.02 → 1004.54] Oh no.
[1004.72 → 1010.38] And so I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm all about tactical bleeping.
[1010.84 → 1019.52] So I think bleeping is the correct way to bleep because you obscure absolutely none of the
[1019.52 → 1019.80] meaning.
[1019.98 → 1027.36] But if there does happen to be a four-year-old watching and even if the parents don't care,
[1028.14 → 1030.36] it's, it reflects, people judge you.
[1030.36 → 1035.34] If your kid shows up at preschool and teaches the other kids the F word, like it's just,
[1035.50 → 1036.44] that's a social norm.
[1036.80 → 1037.70] Deal with it.
[1037.70 → 1042.02] So if there happens to be a four-year-old watching, well, they don't know what that
[1042.02 → 1042.48] word is.
[1042.56 → 1042.90] Yeah, sure.
[1042.94 → 1043.04] Great.
[1043.10 → 1044.86] And if they do, well, that's not on me.
[1045.06 → 1045.26] Okay.
[1045.26 → 1046.18] Bring us back to P scores.
[1046.36 → 1047.36] Bring us back to P scores.
[1047.76 → 1049.34] I don't remember what I was talking about.
[1049.50 → 1049.94] P scores.
[1050.36 → 1050.68] Right.
[1050.78 → 1051.88] It's hard for me to.
[1051.88 → 1054.64] We're just talking about the different dimensions that contribute to the P score.
[1054.82 → 1055.02] Right.
[1055.10 → 1055.30] Okay.
[1055.52 → 1055.76] So.
[1056.64 → 1058.90] We're talking about the issues, the throttling.
[1059.12 → 1060.18] I made a conscious, right.
[1060.22 → 1062.28] I made a conscious decision to keep us advertiser friendly.
[1062.68 → 1070.44] But do I actually believe that that is giving us some kind of unfair advantage in any meaningful
[1070.44 → 1071.60] way on the platform?
[1071.74 → 1073.20] And I would say no.
[1073.20 → 1078.40] In fact, over the last year, we have, let me see how much.
[1078.40 → 1081.58] Well, it's going to increase your P score for brand safety.
[1082.36 → 1083.30] You don't think so?
[1083.60 → 1084.42] Hold on a second here.
[1084.50 → 1084.80] I just want to.
[1084.80 → 1085.08] For sure.
[1085.22 → 1085.36] Yeah.
[1085.42 → 1086.60] In brand safety, sure.
[1086.80 → 1088.76] But here, I'm just going to, I'm going to bring up some analytics.
[1088.94 → 1093.30] I don't usually start diving into the inside baseball here because I'm always afraid to
[1093.30 → 1097.74] show something that like, because YouTube, I'm not supposed to show you guys.
[1097.86 → 1101.60] I hate this thing so much.
[1101.60 → 1105.16] What even am I looking at right now?
[1106.24 → 1107.18] Oh, wait.
[1107.18 → 1107.92] You're looking at the year.
[1108.02 → 1108.80] That's why it's 2019.
[1108.80 → 1109.04] Yeah.
[1109.14 → 1109.28] No.
[1109.32 → 1110.16] Like, what is this?
[1112.42 → 1114.76] It must just be, oh, it's, what is channel analytics?
[1116.00 → 1116.32] What even?
[1116.54 → 1119.24] Oh, oh, I'm in the I'm in the wrong channel.
[1119.58 → 1121.02] You released one video that year.
[1121.04 → 1121.54] That's what happened.
[1121.70 → 1121.90] Yeah.
[1121.92 → 1122.06] Yeah.
[1122.10 → 1122.24] Yeah.
[1122.48 → 1123.34] It's just junk.
[1123.44 → 1123.56] Okay.
[1123.58 → 1124.14] Hold on.
[1124.18 → 1124.72] Hold on a second.
[1124.90 → 1125.02] Okay.
[1125.28 → 1125.62] BRB.
[1125.72 → 1126.08] BRB.
[1126.14 → 1126.40] Okay.
[1126.46 → 1126.68] Okay.
[1126.88 → 1127.30] Here we go.
[1127.36 → 1127.64] Okay.
[1127.84 → 1128.24] All right.
[1128.24 → 1131.38] So I'm going to, I'm going to explain why I don't think it's that big of a deal.
[1131.38 → 1135.22] So one is in spite of our amazing P score.
[1136.60 → 1137.00] Sorry.
[1137.06 → 1137.44] I have to.
[1137.44 → 1141.32] This is exactly, this is one of the reasons why I'm skeptical of this whole thing that they're
[1141.32 → 1141.62] saying.
[1141.78 → 1146.30] And it's because they think like, there are so many things that happen to your videos that
[1146.30 → 1149.38] make you feel like you're being unfairly maligned, or your video is not being served.
[1149.66 → 1149.78] Yeah.
[1149.78 → 1154.24] All these things that happen all the time, and we experienced them, but our P score is huge.
[1154.44 → 1154.70] Yes.
[1155.06 → 1156.64] So why would we still experience them?
[1156.64 → 1160.14] This year has been a pretty big struggle at times for us.
[1160.28 → 1168.18] We were steadily in decline all the way from January down until we hit rock bottom somewhere
[1168.18 → 1171.60] in the neighbourhood of early July.
[1172.20 → 1173.30] Since then, all right, you know what?
[1173.34 → 1175.72] No, this was probably rock bottom and end of May.
[1175.92 → 1177.30] End of May was rock bottom.
[1177.30 → 1184.94] That was the first time we had done 1.4 million views in a day since like 18 months prior.
[1185.16 → 1190.24] Like that was, and to be clear, I'm not, I'm not expecting you guys to feel bad for me.
[1190.80 → 1193.46] Linus Tech Tips is an extremely successful YouTube channel.
[1193.56 → 1194.64] My company is great.
[1194.72 → 1195.56] My staff is awesome.
[1195.56 → 1202.26] I don't expect anybody's pity, but what was alarming about all of this was that going
[1202.26 → 1209.12] from two, three, four, five million a day down to one and a half means that all of a
[1209.12 → 1214.34] sudden you might not be sustainable if that trend were to continue.
[1215.00 → 1221.20] You know, another six months of that, and we could be getting 1 million views a day or 500,000
[1221.20 → 1224.94] views a day and all of a sudden I'd be laying people off.
[1224.94 → 1229.86] So that's something that I, that I've told myself, I never want this to come to.
[1229.96 → 1235.04] So we've, we've taken a very sort of responsible approach to growth, but we had also never seen
[1235.04 → 1240.16] sustained view hemorrhaging like that.
[1240.18 → 1243.76] And we got a lot of complaints from our viewers saying like, oh, well, I'm not getting notifications
[1243.76 → 1244.46] for your videos.
[1244.56 → 1246.88] And we kind of went, yeah, well, that's, that's nothing new though.
[1246.94 → 1249.06] So like, like, what is it exactly that's changing?
[1249.14 → 1253.84] And so anyone I think who's looking at this P score thing and going, oh, well, like, that's
[1253.84 → 1254.38] the problem.
[1254.76 → 1259.92] I think you're missing the bigger picture because during some of the most frustrating
[1259.92 → 1267.18] spells of declining viewership, we've actually had a really, really frustrating last probably
[1267.18 → 1270.64] week or so ever since the Facebook portal video went up.
[1270.70 → 1272.66] I think people were really mad about that video.
[1273.32 → 1279.04] And maybe they thought it was sponsored by Facebook, or maybe they just couldn't handle
[1279.04 → 1285.00] that we were looking at the product for what it is rather than the bogeyman that we were,
[1285.22 → 1286.42] we could imagine it to be.
[1286.54 → 1290.52] Like it was just a straight-up video about the Facebook portal, which is in marketing and
[1290.52 → 1291.74] advertising everywhere.
[1291.86 → 1295.32] And we kind of thought people would want to know about, but people are super mad maybe
[1295.32 → 1297.98] because they thought it was sponsored, or we shouldn't cover it, or I don't know.
[1298.36 → 1302.34] Well, it's that plus a lot of our audiences isn't going to be interested in it anyway.
[1303.00 → 1303.04] So.
[1303.16 → 1303.90] So I get that.
[1303.90 → 1309.26] But ever since then, even on videos that we've thought are kind of slam dunks, like
[1309.26 → 1313.08] the tree planting cannon, that took a long time to gain traction.
[1313.24 → 1317.28] That started out as the worst video in the first couple of hours that we had released
[1317.28 → 1318.38] out of the last 10.
[1318.60 → 1320.50] And that included the Facebook portal.
[1321.08 → 1321.30] Thanks.
[1321.48 → 1322.70] And then now it's grown.
[1322.78 → 1325.10] It's got like 1.4 million views or something like that.
[1325.10 → 1332.38] So it's like really made up ground, but it seems like there are things that can happen
[1332.38 → 1334.96] that have much, much more dramatic effects.
[1335.02 → 1339.18] Because I can tell you guys for sure, our P score didn't change that dramatically in those
[1339.18 → 1339.38] days.
[1339.38 → 1344.64] And the really frustrating thing is that during this time, we've had videos that are performing
[1344.64 → 1349.42] like hot garbage, and I'm getting notifications on my phone every day.
[1349.88 → 1350.56] You're on trending.
[1350.56 → 1355.46] Do you want to send a little notification to your, to your little buddies who follow you
[1355.46 → 1358.82] on YouTube and let them know you're trending so they can congratulate you?
[1358.84 → 1363.16] I'm like, no, I don't want to do that because this video there's literally, I clicked through
[1363.16 → 1366.32] the thing, and it's, so I get this notification you're trending.
[1366.52 → 1370.48] I clicked through the thing, and then I've got this helpful little thing here that says,
[1370.54 → 1378.08] uh, eight out of 10, uh, down arrow, down arrow, lower interest from subscribers and non-subscribers.
[1378.08 → 1381.12] What am I expecting you guys to congratulate me for here exactly?
[1381.58 → 1383.08] My, my epic P score?
[1383.74 → 1386.82] So how do you explain the, uh, those tags for throttling?
[1387.54 → 1389.62] Um, I don't know.
[1389.90 → 1391.62] And so, okay, I think it's-
[1391.62 → 1392.24] I have a, I have a theory.
[1392.36 → 1398.82] I think it's possible that they're throttling certain things, but I also think that people
[1398.82 → 1402.92] might be, um, overestimating the importance of these things.
[1402.92 → 1410.76] So I got a trending notification for 4K video editing PC on a budget, which in spite of having
[1410.76 → 1416.46] a great like to dislike ratio, uh, pretty solid engagement in terms of people leaving
[1416.46 → 1423.64] comments on it, um, was a terrible, that was a terrible, terrible performer for us.
[1423.64 → 1428.82] So I got this, uh, trending notification on it, but if we dig into my analytics for this,
[1428.92 → 1432.46] I hate the new Creator Studio so much.
[1433.22 → 1434.48] Oops, something went wrong.
[1434.64 → 1434.96] Retry.
[1435.54 → 1436.30] Well, yeah.
[1438.30 → 1438.78] Seriously?
[1439.14 → 1441.50] Oh, so now it's just not working at all.
[1441.70 → 1442.78] Okay, give me a second.
[1443.02 → 1447.06] I'm just going to go ahead and go back to Creator Studio Classic if I even still can.
[1447.18 → 1447.62] Here it is.
[1448.24 → 1448.72] Just skip.
[1449.02 → 1450.58] Uh, no, no.
[1450.68 → 1451.86] I'm giving them their feedback.
[1452.20 → 1452.64] Other.
[1453.64 → 1456.18] The page wouldn't load.
[1456.58 → 1461.42] I'm sure glad that you guys are going to start sticking people with this with no option
[1461.42 → 1464.00] to opt out when pages literally don't load it.
[1464.08 → 1464.42] Wow.
[1464.54 → 1465.48] I have to re-sign in.
[1466.50 → 1467.56] Yeah, that's happening this month.
[1468.30 → 1469.16] Yeah, I know, right?
[1470.18 → 1472.02] Well, for a select few people anyway.
[1472.22 → 1473.82] Yeah, but you don't get to pick.
[1473.98 → 1474.58] No, you don't.
[1474.92 → 1478.18] And there's also no guarantee that if you're chosen, that you're going to be chosen for
[1478.18 → 1479.68] all of your different channels.
[1479.68 → 1484.54] So you could be only on the beta on Los Tech Tips, but you're still available on Classic
[1484.54 → 1485.34] for Tech Quickie.
[1487.34 → 1487.70] Yeah.
[1487.82 → 1489.12] Not a consistent experience.
[1489.12 → 1493.82] So let's go find that video again now that we're in the new manager.
[1493.94 → 1494.34] Sorry, guys.
[1494.38 → 1498.70] I would just share you on all the navigation, but I've been told that there are certain
[1498.70 → 1504.06] confidential things in here, especially not necessarily with respect to like how much
[1504.06 → 1509.44] money do you make on YouTube, but with respect to what kind of CPMs you're making that you
[1509.44 → 1511.78] are not allowed to share as part of it.
[1511.78 → 1513.26] Holy crap.
[1513.38 → 1514.06] Stay on Classic.
[1514.76 → 1519.04] It started putting up banners every time you try to navigate to a new page, and then there's
[1519.04 → 1523.74] this horrible header at the top of the screen that like you can't get rid of.
[1523.84 → 1524.90] Like you can't close it.
[1525.34 → 1526.00] There's no button.
[1528.16 → 1531.34] Here's my theory about the throttling tags.
[1531.54 → 1532.64] Where is the...
[1532.64 → 1534.66] Is there no way for me to get into this?
[1535.62 → 1537.36] I clicked video manager.
[1538.46 → 1540.42] You have got to be kidding me.
[1541.78 → 1543.44] They definitely didn't change anything in here.
[1544.08 → 1544.50] Okay.
[1544.62 → 1546.26] Because they don't want to spend any resources doing that.
[1546.56 → 1548.18] This is so stupid.
[1549.06 → 1549.36] Wait.
[1550.28 → 1552.50] Yeah, so I want to see the analytics for this video.
[1552.58 → 1553.10] Here's the thing.
[1553.66 → 1556.94] That throttling tag could just mean that your P score is being throttled.
[1557.50 → 1562.60] That there are certain aspects of your video that are contributing to a lower P score.
[1564.18 → 1565.88] That's how I would interpret it.
[1567.12 → 1567.56] Yes.
[1568.00 → 1569.16] That could be...
[1569.16 → 1571.20] I actually doubt that, though.
[1571.78 → 1572.08] Why?
[1574.08 → 1574.36] Okay.
[1574.44 → 1574.58] Here.
[1574.68 → 1574.84] Sorry.
[1574.96 → 1575.74] Give me a sec.
[1575.78 → 1577.84] I'm just trying to find this stupid thing.
[1578.82 → 1579.20] All right.
[1580.32 → 1580.92] You know what?
[1580.94 → 1582.10] I'm just not going to worry about it.
[1582.14 → 1587.10] You guys will just see the revenue numbers for this video because I can't be arsed to hide
[1587.10 → 1587.24] it.
[1588.44 → 1588.80] All right.
[1588.88 → 1589.38] So here we go.
[1589.42 → 1591.56] Let's have a look at the analytics for this video.
[1591.56 → 1595.10] So in the time period we're looking at, which doesn't include today, that's normal.
[1595.48 → 1597.80] It's got 620,000 views.
[1598.44 → 1599.96] Solid like-dislike ratio.
[1600.92 → 1602.46] You know, we generated some new subscribers.
[1602.64 → 1603.32] That's pretty cool.
[1603.72 → 1604.80] Shares is always low.
[1604.80 → 1611.38] I always get a kick out of people thinking that, like, shares is this super crucial metric.
[1611.38 → 1617.06] If something's going to go viral, yeah, a lot of shares is probably great, but it's
[1617.06 → 1619.70] far from the main driving factor.
[1619.70 → 1627.38] What drives a video these days is, let me just see if I can get into, here we go.
[1627.50 → 1628.72] So let's have a look at watch time.
[1628.78 → 1630.32] But yeah, it's all algorithmic.
[1630.70 → 1631.26] So here we go.
[1631.50 → 1634.48] Let's go to views because why would I want watch time to be my default?
[1634.62 → 1637.14] Why do I care about watch time on a video-by-video basis?
[1638.42 → 1640.40] Impression click-through, 4.68%.
[1640.40 → 1645.66] That's, like, kind of decent, actually, for the first couple of days.
[1645.66 → 1649.90] And if YouTube was serving as many impressions on this as they do for some of our videos,
[1650.00 → 1651.50] it probably would have performed better.
[1651.98 → 1654.36] Average view duration at eight minutes is really solid.
[1654.98 → 1655.94] But let's have a look here.
[1656.00 → 1660.30] So one of the things that I think everyone pretty much agrees P-score effects is your
[1660.30 → 1661.08] ability to hit trending.
[1661.62 → 1668.76] That's why it's constantly Stephen Colbert, John Oliver, Jimmy Camel, and us.
[1669.20 → 1671.20] We're on trending, like, every day.
[1671.56 → 1675.14] But a lot of the creators that I talk to, they're like, wow, yeah, you guys are doing so great.
[1675.14 → 1676.26] You're, like, on trending all the time.
[1676.34 → 1677.88] Like, yeah, look at the actual views on the video.
[1678.30 → 1679.36] So let's go back into-
[1679.36 → 1680.78] No, those two are non-correlative.
[1680.92 → 1682.32] Let's go back into the analytics here.
[1682.42 → 1684.66] So where's my sources?
[1686.04 → 1686.80] Traffic sources.
[1686.94 → 1687.36] Here we go.
[1689.54 → 1689.96] All right.
[1689.98 → 1690.86] So browse features.
[1691.46 → 1700.06] This is your homepage home screen, subscription feed, and other browsing features.
[1700.06 → 1704.36] So that's where we're getting 60% of our views from.
[1704.98 → 1705.88] Suggested videos.
[1706.34 → 1710.10] So suggested alongside other videos or after them.
[1710.24 → 1711.38] That's 17%.
[1711.38 → 1712.60] Channel pages.
[1713.16 → 1717.36] Traffic from YouTube channel pages or other people's YouTube channel pages or topic channel
[1717.36 → 1717.66] pages.
[1717.76 → 1718.66] We get another 6% there.
[1718.68 → 1719.40] That's unusually high.
[1720.02 → 1721.10] Direct or unknown.
[1721.42 → 1723.62] So this might be people sharing it off-platform.
[1723.62 → 1724.82] Notifications.
[1726.66 → 1728.68] Where even is trending?
[1729.58 → 1731.38] I can't even find it anymore.
[1732.98 → 1733.76] Here, let's go into it.
[1733.76 → 1735.46] Even in your precious classic view.
[1735.76 → 1736.46] Is it in browse?
[1736.48 → 1736.74] Ha!
[1737.42 → 1737.94] Here we go.
[1738.04 → 1738.36] Okay.
[1738.72 → 1738.90] Woo!
[1739.52 → 1739.98] Great.
[1740.36 → 1742.10] So browse features is perfect.
[1742.56 → 1744.60] So home is 67% of that.
[1745.02 → 1747.02] Subscriptions is 31% of that.
[1747.60 → 1749.62] Watch later is 1.8% of that.
[1749.98 → 1751.84] Watch history is 0.5% of that.
[1751.84 → 1758.02] This video hit trending and got literally 9,000 people saw it.
[1758.56 → 1761.04] And I'm pretty sure this one trended in more than one country.
[1761.32 → 1761.34] That's an impression.
[1761.44 → 1761.86] Saw it.
[1761.96 → 1762.50] Saw it.
[1762.96 → 1767.12] Out of which 117 people watched it.
[1768.14 → 1771.52] 90% of 1% clicked through.
[1771.84 → 1779.10] So if people are imagining that this P score giving you some kind of huge leg up because
[1779.10 → 1783.22] you're trending all the time is a big deal, that's a video that trended.
[1783.64 → 1790.06] I got literally 117 views, which registered as 0%.
[1790.06 → 1793.00] 0.0%.
[1793.00 → 1795.46] Not only that, but this is great.
[1795.46 → 1800.40] Of those people, they had the lowest average view duration.
[1800.94 → 1802.86] So they didn't even watch the video.
[1803.56 → 1807.30] So it's actually detrimental for your video to be on trending because that just lowers
[1807.30 → 1808.04] your CPMs.
[1808.14 → 1809.34] Increasing your bounce rate.
[1809.82 → 1810.70] No, no, no.
[1810.70 → 1811.30] Your CTR.
[1811.46 → 1811.88] Your click-through rate.
[1811.90 → 1812.50] Yeah, your click-through rate.
[1812.58 → 1816.02] So it lowers your click through ratio, but again, not in any appreciable way.
[1816.02 → 1817.88] And it increases your bounce rate.
[1818.06 → 1822.36] So the rate at which people jump into your video, go, ah, these sucks and leave, which
[1822.36 → 1826.72] is bad because that affects how the video gets promoted via the other mechanisms that
[1826.72 → 1828.04] actually matter.
[1829.76 → 1832.06] So have I, yeah, this is great.
[1832.16 → 1836.04] Dead Polymers says, I never even look at trending.
[1836.28 → 1836.48] Right.
[1837.18 → 1837.90] Well, why would you?
[1837.94 → 1839.40] Because it's just going to show you stuff.
[1839.50 → 1843.12] If you're not interested in tech, and it puts it on your trending page, it's like, you're
[1843.12 → 1843.70] not going to watch it anyway.
[1843.86 → 1844.74] Yeah, exactly.
[1844.74 → 1847.86] So what are we talking about again?
[1848.10 → 1848.78] Can we just move on?
[1849.94 → 1851.88] So yeah, we, oh, right.
[1852.02 → 1856.10] So something else that I had wanted to talk about, and I can't give you guys exact numbers
[1856.10 → 1860.72] here, unfortunately, because it is one of the things that YouTube is extremely sensitive
[1860.72 → 1861.20] about.
[1861.46 → 1872.94] Creators sharing their ad fill rates, their CPMs, their C, whatever the RPMs, whatever, yeah,
[1872.94 → 1876.06] whatever, the effective, how much you're getting paid per view.
[1876.06 → 1876.82] That's revenue per minute.
[1876.86 → 1877.40] All that stuff.
[1877.40 → 1877.68] Or per million.
[1877.86 → 1879.50] Yeah, per mid, per thousand.
[1879.82 → 1879.98] Yeah.
[1880.04 → 1880.76] M-I-L-I-E.
[1880.76 → 1881.36] Yeah, yeah, yeah, mid, a million.
[1881.36 → 1887.20] So your CPM, your cost per mid, which doesn't factor in people who use AdBlock or whatever
[1887.20 → 1891.86] else, and then your revenue per mid, which is just your overall, your aggregate score,
[1892.14 → 1893.24] not score, like rate.
[1893.68 → 1896.80] They don't like people disclosing that stuff, so I can't give you guys exact numbers, but
[1896.80 → 1906.62] what I will tell you is as someone with a high P score, it's huge, my RPM, so the actual
[1906.62 → 1916.00] like money that comes into Linus Media Group's coffers on advertising supported content was
[1916.00 → 1925.08] comparable or lower to even gaming channels who have notoriously poor CPMs that I talked
[1925.08 → 1926.18] to at the Top Creator Summit.
[1926.94 → 1931.66] I don't know if that's because of a high percentage of our users engaging AdBlock.
[1932.36 → 1933.40] I don't know.
[1933.76 → 1936.72] I don't really know what it's to do with at all, actually.
[1937.58 → 1940.50] And it's not the kind of thing that Google will talk about.
[1940.60 → 1945.08] They're very cagey anytime you're like, well, hey, how's our CPMs compared to other people
[1945.08 → 1945.80] in the space?
[1945.88 → 1947.84] They're like, fine.
[1949.04 → 1951.28] You know, like they're not really going to talk to you about that.
[1951.28 → 1958.64] So I can say that from my own experience, P score doesn't appear to generate more revenue
[1958.64 → 1960.26] for me in any meaningful way.
[1960.32 → 1967.46] In fact, if I cared about increasing the revenue that we make from YouTube directly, as opposed
[1967.46 → 1971.92] to the sponsorships and partnerships that we work on our own, I would be pushing
[1971.92 → 1973.12] everyone to sign up for Red.
[1973.44 → 1974.84] Or sorry, what would they call it?
[1974.92 → 1975.62] Yeah, YouTube Premium.
[1976.02 → 1976.70] Yeah, YouTube Premium.
[1976.70 → 1981.52] Because a viewer on YouTube Premium is worth, I forget what it is, it's something like 6
[1981.52 → 1986.10] to 10x or something like that compared to a viewer who is ad supported.
[1986.50 → 1991.58] Now, part of the reason for that might be that we do not include mid-roll ads in our videos.
[1991.58 → 1996.32] And that's something that I know YouTube is big on people enabling.
[1996.68 → 2002.88] So creating natural ad breaks within their videos and then plunking down mid-roll ads throughout
[2002.88 → 2003.28] the video.
[2003.42 → 2009.92] But the way that we see it, I kind of actually hope no one from YouTube is really watching
[2009.92 → 2010.44] right now.
[2011.84 → 2017.18] But like, you guys suck at monetizing mid-roll in a video.
[2017.76 → 2022.04] Like there is so much stuff that you guys could do way better.
[2022.44 → 2029.18] And giving top creators anyway, like people who have the resources, access to better tools,
[2029.18 → 2030.66] I think could dramatically improve it.
[2030.66 → 2036.04] So you guys have probably noticed if you watch our channel regularly, there's a spot for Honey,
[2036.14 → 2039.76] the web browser extension that features me explaining what Honey is.
[2039.84 → 2044.24] But then that Honey is actually using as a pre-roll and a mid-roll on YouTube.
[2044.88 → 2051.50] Imagine if YouTubers had the power to work with brands to create their own pre-rolls and
[2051.50 → 2056.60] mid-rolls that instead of just being some random ad that's just plunked into a video,
[2056.60 → 2061.74] it was coming from a voice that the person watching actually wants to hear from.
[2061.86 → 2067.00] Like that's why integrations that are built into the video that are read by the host of
[2067.00 → 2075.38] the video command so much higher CPMs than random algorithm-driven stuff from Google.
[2075.68 → 2081.26] So the reality of it is if we have the resources to manage it, it is actually more cost-effective
[2081.26 → 2088.96] for me to employ not one, not two, but three people who pretty much their entire jobs are
[2088.96 → 2095.38] to go out and make these business deals and then include our own sponsor reads than it
[2095.38 → 2099.62] is for me to just not have them do it and plunk in YouTube's advertising.
[2099.76 → 2100.40] And we've tried it.
[2100.60 → 2101.08] We've tried it.
[2101.10 → 2102.44] But how would YouTube make money off of that?
[2102.44 → 2106.64] I mean, they could create the tools where...
[2107.54 → 2108.56] That costs them money?
[2109.00 → 2109.96] That costs them money.
[2110.04 → 2110.60] Yes, of course.
[2110.68 → 2115.46] So they create these tools, and then I would be willing to give them a cut because obviously
[2115.46 → 2120.38] I have overhead from running my own sales team or in the case of a lot of other YouTubers
[2120.38 → 2121.48] having an agent.
[2121.98 → 2126.42] It's pretty typical for an agent to take 10% right off the top regardless of how much the
[2126.42 → 2127.50] deal is or more.
[2127.82 → 2130.02] And there are a lot of deals out there that are more than 10%.
[2130.02 → 2134.94] I'd say 10% is like when you're someone like me, and you have a pretty strong negotiating
[2134.94 → 2137.34] position, you can demand 10%.
[2137.34 → 2142.82] If you're smaller to the point where the deals coming in are so small that 10% would
[2142.82 → 2146.18] just not even be worth their time, you could expect to be paying quite a bit more.
[2147.20 → 2148.74] I could see why they wouldn't build those tools.
[2149.24 → 2151.48] Their whole ad platform is based on the auctions.
[2151.66 → 2152.06] Automation.
[2152.16 → 2152.80] It's scalable.
[2152.80 → 2153.12] I know.
[2153.54 → 2154.62] There's so few...
[2154.62 → 2154.64] I know.
[2154.74 → 2157.46] In an absolute sense, there's so few...
[2157.46 → 2160.00] Or in a proportion sense, I mean, proportionally, there's so few creative
[2160.02 → 2164.92] creators that would even have this available to them who have those connections and everything.
[2165.10 → 2168.12] Honestly, though, I think that's part of their problem just as a company is trying
[2168.12 → 2170.04] to turn everything into a machine learning problem.
[2170.62 → 2180.06] I mean, we have gotten away with making some pretty egregious mistakes with our sponsors
[2180.06 → 2184.00] and with our brand partners and with all the people in the industry that we work with.
[2184.66 → 2189.98] And through the magic of human contact, we've managed to smooth over the vast majority of
[2189.98 → 2190.50] those things.
[2191.36 → 2194.84] Whereas I think that's how Google ends up with things like Apocalypse on their hands.
[2194.90 → 2198.18] If they were actually talking to their partners all the time, I don't think they get blind sided
[2198.18 → 2199.04] by something like that.
[2199.04 → 2202.16] But this is me probably speaking out of turn.
[2202.60 → 2204.86] You know, I did attend Brand cast.
[2204.94 → 2207.98] That was a pretty cool show that they put on for their advertising partners, I guess.
[2208.06 → 2209.14] There was a cocktail hour after.
[2210.12 → 2210.98] Maybe that's all you need to do.
[2210.98 → 2212.18] Well, you're just butt hurt.
[2212.26 → 2213.36] You weren't invited to team day.
[2215.58 → 2216.62] Two years in a row.
[2216.62 → 2224.18] Speaking of butt hurt, I would be butt hurt if I, whatever, something, something, segue
[2224.18 → 2225.32] the sponsors for the WAN show.
[2225.44 → 2225.58] Right.
[2225.68 → 2232.28] Speaking of it making more sense for us to just get our own sponsors, boss, this is the
[2232.28 → 2233.76] Backpack Grande.
[2234.84 → 2235.68] Aye, aye, aye.
[2236.86 → 2240.48] Basically, it takes the best features from both the Backpack and the Grande.
[2240.78 → 2242.80] So it fits laptops up to 17 inches.
[2242.80 → 2246.58] It's made from 1680D ballistic nylon for abrasion and tear resistance.
[2246.94 → 2251.38] Its orange colour interior makes it easy to find items inside the backpack if they're
[2251.38 → 2251.88] down at the bottom.
[2252.00 → 2252.74] There's nothing in here.
[2252.78 → 2255.68] And it has a built-in rain fly to protect your bag from the element.
[2256.54 → 2257.90] It just says element singular.
[2258.08 → 2258.52] I guess that makes sense.
[2258.52 → 2259.22] Well, it's only rain.
[2259.36 → 2259.86] Just water.
[2260.76 → 2264.18] I mean, if you have like lightning, it's not really going to do anything.
[2264.40 → 2266.64] Will the snow count is the same element?
[2267.34 → 2267.74] Oh, yeah.
[2267.82 → 2268.18] Oh, God.
[2268.22 → 2268.82] I shouldn't have done this.
[2268.92 → 2270.26] The snow is definitely the same element.
[2270.26 → 2273.82] So their Kickstarter for this backpack is coming out soon.
[2274.14 → 2278.24] You can check out the link leg.GG slash moss kickstarter to check it out.
[2278.30 → 2279.66] It's going to be a limited quantity thing.
[2279.86 → 2281.34] So, yeah.
[2282.06 → 2283.26] Available charging station.
[2283.44 → 2284.56] External pouches for water bottle.
[2284.68 → 2286.36] That's actually really, really nice to have.
[2286.70 → 2287.80] Does our water bottle fit?
[2288.08 → 2288.54] You know what?
[2288.78 → 2292.66] I'm not promoting their external water bottle pouch unless our water bottle fits in it.
[2292.74 → 2293.38] I don't know.
[2293.48 → 2294.60] Our P-score is so huge.
[2294.64 → 2295.40] I wouldn't be surprised.
[2296.04 → 2297.06] If it didn't go in there.
[2297.10 → 2297.28] Oh.
[2298.34 → 2298.60] Wow.
[2298.84 → 2299.00] What?
[2299.00 → 2299.32] Does it fit?
[2299.32 → 2300.18] Oh.
[2301.84 → 2302.74] Oh, you know what?
[2302.88 → 2305.96] I think the issue is the lid holder.
[2306.06 → 2308.16] I have another water bottle with me here.
[2309.18 → 2310.30] Don't do that.
[2310.94 → 2312.88] Putting your YouTube water bottle in there.
[2312.88 → 2313.30] Wait a second.
[2313.30 → 2313.82] Is that one that's on the other?
[2313.82 → 2315.22] There's like an HDMI cable in there.
[2315.32 → 2316.52] No, there's a power cable in here.
[2316.60 → 2316.90] Oh, yeah.
[2316.94 → 2319.94] That's for the integrated battery thing.
[2321.00 → 2321.36] Okay.
[2321.44 → 2323.50] Well, at any rate, maybe they could make it.
[2323.64 → 2324.04] You know what?
[2324.10 → 2327.00] Moss, if you guys are watching, love your backpacks.
[2327.00 → 2331.24] But can you make this just a little bit bigger so that my water bottle fits in it?
[2331.82 → 2333.00] That's all I ask.
[2333.14 → 2333.86] That's all I ask.
[2333.92 → 2334.56] So go check it out.
[2334.64 → 2336.18] LNG.GG slash Moss Kickstarter.
[2336.18 → 2339.48] Oh, the show also brought to you by FreshBooks.
[2339.60 → 2341.44] Nervous laughter all throughout the department.
[2342.76 → 2343.12] Oh, right.
[2343.18 → 2343.50] Hold on.
[2343.58 → 2346.78] So again, if you don't have honey already, that was joinhoney.com slash Linus.
[2347.28 → 2347.64] FreshBooks.
[2347.74 → 2347.92] FreshBooks.
[2347.92 → 2348.34] FreshBooks.
[2348.34 → 2352.10] Is the super simple to use invoicing tool that does more than just help you create slick
[2352.10 → 2352.78] looking invoices.
[2353.04 → 2355.04] You can track your time with their timesheet function.
[2355.36 → 2357.84] You can manage your expenses, keeping track of who owes you what.
[2358.10 → 2360.54] The mobile app has all the functionality of their desktop version.
[2360.54 → 2363.00] So you can take FreshBooks with you on the go.
[2363.30 → 2365.26] I really need to get my SIM back in the fold.
[2365.34 → 2366.68] I actually put it in my backpack.
[2366.88 → 2368.02] I'm going to switch back to it this weekend.
[2368.12 → 2370.20] I just logged out of all my accounts because they were shooting B-roll.
[2370.20 → 2375.32] And that seems pretty stupid to have the CEO's email signed in to a phone that someone's just
[2375.32 → 2375.80] using.
[2376.90 → 2381.88] And if you have any trouble, you can contact their support staff and talk to a real human
[2381.88 → 2382.62] being for help.
[2382.70 → 2387.04] So visit FreshBooks.com slash WAN and enter WAN in the How Did You Hear About Us section
[2387.04 → 2388.30] when you sign up for your free trial.
[2388.46 → 2388.66] WAN.
[2388.76 → 2389.50] WAN.
[2389.88 → 2390.14] WAN.
[2390.40 → 2391.48] I can't figure this out.
[2391.54 → 2392.06] WAN.
[2392.90 → 2393.48] Let's go to Netflix.
[2394.54 → 2395.62] You want to go to the Netflix thing?
[2395.72 → 2396.00] Yeah.
[2396.40 → 2397.70] I just want to make sure we have time for it.
[2397.70 → 2398.20] I want to talk.
[2398.34 → 2399.64] We need another hour on this show.
[2399.64 → 2400.74] I want some savage jerky.
[2400.80 → 2401.58] I am so hungry.
[2401.66 → 2402.62] I didn't get a chance to eat today.
[2402.90 → 2403.12] Okay.
[2403.14 → 2403.66] Here's the thing.
[2404.12 → 2410.22] So Netflix is trialling on Android mobile devices the ability to alter your playback speed,
[2410.34 → 2411.28] just like you can on YouTube.
[2411.66 → 2418.48] You can go 0.5 speed, 0.75 speed, normal speed, 1.25 and 1.5.
[2419.16 → 2423.10] Now, interestingly, even though I usually speed stuff up, I have heard from people who slow
[2423.10 → 2423.48] it down.
[2423.70 → 2426.42] People who have English as maybe an additional language.
[2426.42 → 2426.58] Oh, okay.
[2426.58 → 2427.80] They'll watch it more slowly.
[2428.06 → 2428.24] Yeah.
[2428.36 → 2428.70] That makes sense.
[2428.70 → 2433.00] There's a lot of other people who watch certain types of content really fast because they
[2433.00 → 2437.08] like more information density, especially if you're watching a college lecture or something
[2437.08 → 2437.56] like that.
[2438.18 → 2442.36] Or frankly, when I watch our videos, especially if I'm looking for certain information just
[2442.36 → 2446.26] as reference, I just crank it up to 1.75, I feel is a good one.
[2446.32 → 2446.92] Sometimes two.
[2446.92 → 2453.22] I usually have a hard time with two unless the host is kind of one of those slow talkers
[2453.22 → 2455.80] who seems to be kind of thinking while they're presenting.
[2455.80 → 2456.78] You know what's weird, though?
[2456.82 → 2461.08] Is when you crank it up, at first it sounds weird, but then very quickly it sounds like
[2461.08 → 2462.60] that could just be their normal presenting speed.
[2462.78 → 2462.80] Yeah.
[2462.80 → 2468.34] I've had people walk up to me in person and be surprised at how low the pitch of my voice
[2468.34 → 2470.64] is because they always watch it 1.5 or 2x.
[2471.46 → 2472.24] It's kind of funny.
[2472.70 → 2477.20] Sometimes I've thought maybe we should just export our content faster and just save people
[2477.20 → 2478.00] for having to do that.
[2478.00 → 2487.00] I wouldn't do it on the main channel, but if we had a secondary channel, is Linus Tech
[2487.00 → 2487.60] Tips faster?
[2489.54 → 2490.82] Faster than fast as possible?
[2491.00 → 2491.08] Yeah.
[2491.62 → 2492.64] Fastener than possible.
[2492.80 → 2499.62] Okay, so they're trialling this thing and there are some notable members of the Hollywood community,
[2499.62 → 2502.48] I guess, the film community, who spoke out about it.
[2502.72 → 2506.96] Judd Apatow tweeted about it, as did Breaking Bad star Aaron Powell.
[2506.96 → 2507.46] Yeah.
[2507.46 → 2507.56] Pow.
[2508.86 → 2511.44] Apathy said, no, Netflix, no.
[2511.72 → 2515.70] Don't make me have to call every director and show creator on Earth to fight you on this.
[2516.30 → 2519.20] Aaron Powell said, there is no way Netflix will move forward with this.
[2519.44 → 2523.50] That would mean they are completely taking control of everyone else's art and destroying it.
[2523.86 → 2525.16] Netflix is far better than that.
[2525.34 → 2526.12] Am I right, Netflix?
[2526.74 → 2528.12] Can I present...
[2528.78 → 2529.12] Okay, so...
[2529.90 → 2530.68] Oh, this is interesting.
[2530.82 → 2534.16] Vimeo apparently allows creators to decide whether playback controls are exposed.
[2534.30 → 2535.50] That could be an interesting middle ground.
[2535.50 → 2537.92] May I play devil's advocate here for a moment?
[2538.14 → 2538.64] Lay is on us.
[2538.76 → 2545.26] So, Mr. Powell, you're all upset about your art and whatever.
[2547.16 → 2548.22] Are you the customer?
[2551.44 → 2553.10] That's an interesting question.
[2554.46 → 2557.48] Who exactly are you, Aaron Powell?
[2557.62 → 2559.42] I'm sorry, I don't actually know who that is.
[2559.42 → 2562.66] Who are you to tell me how I consume my content?
[2563.46 → 2563.86] Exactly.
[2565.42 → 2566.00] But don't...
[2566.00 → 2567.16] What if I like it better?
[2567.20 → 2568.88] Dude, it's the dude from Breaking Bad, Jesse.
[2569.56 → 2569.84] Sure.
[2570.58 → 2571.66] And that says Paul.
[2572.58 → 2575.04] So, it probably doesn't help that there was a typo in our doc.
[2575.16 → 2575.80] Oh, there you go.
[2576.00 → 2576.78] That's way easier.
[2577.86 → 2579.42] Yeah, I had no idea who Aaron Powell was.
[2579.90 → 2581.28] You knew who Aaron Powell was?
[2581.30 → 2581.88] Didn't know that either.
[2582.64 → 2583.20] Come on.
[2583.20 → 2583.76] Well, no.
[2584.00 → 2585.66] Yeah, I would recognize his face.
[2585.82 → 2586.62] I don't follow...
[2586.62 → 2587.16] I didn't know his name either.
[2587.26 → 2587.84] I saw the new movie.
[2587.92 → 2588.40] I watched the show.
[2588.46 → 2588.82] I'm sorry.
[2589.10 → 2589.30] Okay.
[2589.42 → 2589.74] Anyway.
[2591.34 → 2593.80] But it's not a matter of who are you.
[2593.88 → 2594.02] Okay.
[2594.06 → 2594.68] I know who you are.
[2594.78 → 2595.46] But okay.
[2595.52 → 2596.28] So, you're a famous dude.
[2597.16 → 2600.08] So, famous dude gets to decide how I consume content?
[2600.56 → 2601.10] So, wait.
[2601.26 → 2606.26] Does Kellogg's get to include a manual in the cereal box?
[2606.26 → 2606.32] Okay.
[2606.32 → 2611.04] Well, then why is it when we review monitors, and we go through our colour...
[2611.04 → 2613.44] Like, we always care about having colour accurate settings.
[2614.36 → 2614.58] Yeah.
[2614.58 → 2618.18] We care about how the game is supposed to look, or the movie is supposed to look.
[2618.30 → 2618.56] Yes.
[2618.56 → 2619.58] Especially on our TV settings.
[2620.04 → 2622.48] That's following the intent of the creator.
[2622.56 → 2623.60] And that's our prerogative.
[2624.08 → 2629.94] If I wanted to crank the vivid setting of my monitor up to 100% and crank the sharpness,
[2630.08 → 2638.16] I can call myself a tacky, half-obviously, like, either blind or high idiot.
[2638.42 → 2638.68] Sure.
[2638.92 → 2641.28] But that's my right as a consumer.
[2641.36 → 2641.78] How about this?
[2641.98 → 2642.28] Fine.
[2642.44 → 2642.72] Go ahead.
[2642.82 → 2647.90] Because one argument I think that Apathy was making is, like, you spend so much time over
[2647.90 → 2651.10] the pacing of the video and, like, how long shots are held for and all this stuff.
[2651.44 → 2653.26] And then if you're watching at a different speed, that could be different.
[2653.58 → 2654.18] So, people...
[2654.18 → 2655.20] Let's say this catches on.
[2655.62 → 2655.76] Sure.
[2655.76 → 2660.22] And weirdos, in my opinion, are watching, like, dramatic content.
[2660.38 → 2662.88] Not documentaries or other informational content.
[2663.14 → 2666.90] They're watching, like, dramas at 1.5x speed.
[2667.24 → 2667.44] Yeah.
[2667.54 → 2671.46] And then they're going online, and they're voicing their opinion on these works of art.
[2671.98 → 2673.00] They're giving reviews.
[2673.40 → 2678.36] There's, like, critical consensus based on something you didn't really make.
[2678.36 → 2678.92] Okay.
[2680.26 → 2688.10] So, by that logic, should we ban skimming in books for fear that people will go and leave
[2688.10 → 2692.20] a review of the book having actually skimmed over some paragraphs?
[2693.20 → 2694.88] Well, that's not possible.
[2695.26 → 2696.22] You can't enforce that.
[2696.96 → 2697.26] Right.
[2697.52 → 2699.40] And I'm saying you can't enforce this.
[2699.94 → 2705.00] Once you ship the art, it is up to the user to enjoy it the way that they wish to enjoy it.
[2705.00 → 2708.46] Maybe they feel like this because they...
[2708.46 → 2710.58] Because Netflix is a middleman.
[2711.28 → 2711.78] It's basically...
[2711.78 → 2712.86] It's a broker of the art.
[2713.34 → 2713.74] Correct.
[2714.24 → 2716.12] And so, they're enabling these tools.
[2716.58 → 2717.80] I like the Vimeo approach.
[2718.34 → 2722.16] I like the Vimeo approach of saying, if the creator thinks you should have this tool,
[2722.26 → 2723.82] then the creator can give you the tool.
[2726.98 → 2728.46] Yeah, I guess so.
[2728.46 → 2731.88] The problem, though, is that then you are...
[2731.88 → 2736.34] Because, really, Netflix is only sort of the middleman.
[2736.60 → 2742.46] Because Netflix has worked hard to position themselves as an end-to-end content delivery
[2742.46 → 2743.00] platform.
[2743.52 → 2749.30] So, I think the way that a lot of people view their television or movies is, like, watching
[2749.30 → 2749.80] on Netflix.
[2750.44 → 2751.00] It's on Netflix.
[2751.34 → 2753.00] I'm watching Netflix.
[2753.38 → 2755.44] How many times have you heard someone say, I'm watching Netflix?
[2756.26 → 2757.00] A bazillion times.
[2757.10 → 2757.30] Right.
[2757.30 → 2765.26] They're not saying, I am watching Aaron Paul, star of Breaking Bad, through the intermediary
[2765.26 → 2766.78] platform, Netflix.
[2767.54 → 2768.24] They're watching Netflix.
[2768.84 → 2775.74] And so, from a Netflix standpoint, if they're trying to build a user-centric experience,
[2776.12 → 2780.10] they're going to push features that maybe partners don't like.
[2780.24 → 2783.92] Like the ability to download episodes onto your phone so you can watch them offline.
[2784.00 → 2786.92] Or the ability to watch it at a different speed if you're in a hurry.
[2786.92 → 2787.96] Some of us have a life.
[2788.60 → 2789.24] Mr. Paul?
[2789.62 → 2790.92] They also made a...
[2791.44 → 2795.92] They collaborated with some TV brands to have, like, a Netflix calibrated mode.
[2795.92 → 2801.80] So, and with the express purpose of being able to consume the content as the director wanted
[2801.80 → 2802.08] you to do.
[2802.08 → 2802.24] Right.
[2802.36 → 2803.04] But it is a choice.
[2803.06 → 2804.04] That is the choice.
[2804.04 → 2811.38] And if Netflix was making this the default, if Netflix was sitting there going, okay,
[2811.46 → 2813.22] they got their board, right?
[2813.30 → 2814.66] They're around the boardroom table.
[2815.20 → 2817.60] And they're going, imagine this.
[2817.60 → 2826.04] We speed up every movie by 7%, increasing user watch time by 7% and our revenues by 7%.
[2826.04 → 2827.74] It's good.
[2827.96 → 2828.20] Right.
[2828.56 → 2835.92] If they went and that was their motivation behind making an accelerated view speed the default
[2835.92 → 2839.96] option so they could extract more, actually, no, they'd be paying more royalties.
[2840.14 → 2840.56] Okay, whatever.
[2840.66 → 2841.08] It doesn't matter.
[2841.18 → 2842.78] Okay, they slowed it down by 7%.
[2842.78 → 2843.28] I don't know.
[2843.36 → 2843.82] It doesn't matter.
[2844.46 → 2845.28] That would be egregious.
[2845.28 → 2848.90] If they were doing it, if they were making it the default and if they were doing it for
[2848.90 → 2852.40] some kind of money-grubbing reason, then I would be outraged.
[2852.96 → 2861.22] If the default is a correct colour profile at the correct speed and with a minimal interface
[2861.22 → 2865.86] with no interruptions, that is correct.
[2866.28 → 2871.22] And then if anyone's upset about additional options and features that Netflix wants to
[2871.22 → 2874.34] provide to its users, presumably based on user demand.
[2874.34 → 2876.10] I mean, they're only trialling the feature.
[2876.22 → 2879.02] If people hate it, then they're probably not going to keep it in there.
[2879.08 → 2880.00] No, people will use it.
[2880.44 → 2881.62] Of course people will use it.
[2881.72 → 2882.62] I would use it sometimes.
[2883.30 → 2884.46] I might use it for a documentary.
[2884.48 → 2885.72] I was going to say, a documentary.
[2886.02 → 2886.46] That's great.
[2886.56 → 2888.18] It would totally make sense.
[2888.26 → 2891.78] I mean, David Attenborough, his voice is so deep anyway.
[2891.92 → 2892.78] No, but check this out.
[2892.98 → 2897.92] They put in an auto pitch correction feature so you can speed it up without altering the sound
[2897.92 → 2898.34] too much.
[2898.42 → 2899.20] Okay, that's pretty cool.
[2900.22 → 2901.44] That kind of is weird, though.
[2901.44 → 2906.10] I kind of want the altered sound to remind me that I'm consuming it in not the normal way.
[2906.34 → 2908.04] So, I mean, it's not going to be perfect.
[2908.42 → 2908.96] No, it won't.
[2909.52 → 2910.30] Here's the thing.
[2910.52 → 2912.60] I was playing devil's advocate there.
[2912.60 → 2922.94] I do not think that particularly narrative content should be sped up.
[2923.58 → 2928.66] I believe in using a colour calibrated profile on my display.
[2928.66 → 2936.30] I believe in consuming the content the way that the creator intended.
[2936.44 → 2940.50] And for that reason, I actually end up consuming less content than I otherwise would.
[2940.56 → 2945.80] If I was willing to watch the I can't call it the new Blade Runner, even though it is relatively
[2945.80 → 2946.12] new.
[2946.26 → 2949.26] If I was willing to watch it on my phone or on a plane, I would have seen it already.
[2949.26 → 2954.10] But I'm waiting until I have two and a half hours.
[2954.10 → 2955.02] You should watch it here.
[2955.50 → 2956.42] I'm totally down.
[2956.42 → 2958.18] Oh, that subwoofer would be sick.
[2958.32 → 2959.32] You should totally watch it here.
[2959.80 → 2965.46] I'm down, but I won't consume it until I have two and a half, three hours to sit and watch
[2965.46 → 2966.62] it properly.
[2967.30 → 2970.54] And when I don't have my wife around because she doesn't want to see it.
[2970.94 → 2972.30] So that's why I haven't seen it yet.
[2972.30 → 2973.94] Because I'm waiting for a lot of stars to align.
[2974.02 → 2974.88] Dad will watch it.
[2975.46 → 2975.56] Yeah.
[2975.76 → 2983.94] The reason I put this topic in here was because I believe Yvonne told me that she has watched
[2983.94 → 2985.60] TV shows sped up.
[2986.52 → 2988.88] So Yvonne, this is great.
[2988.88 → 2989.20] Like movies.
[2989.20 → 2993.80] Because philosophically, she and I are so different from each other.
[2994.08 → 3001.00] For her, a lot of the time, a TV show or a movie is keeping your company.
[3001.48 → 3001.74] Okay.
[3001.74 → 3003.80] While she sews or whatever.
[3003.84 → 3005.60] She's not even really paying attention to it.
[3006.04 → 3011.12] And then sometimes she'll get drawn in, and then it's like, sorry, how many seasons of
[3011.12 → 3012.00] this freaking thing are there?
[3012.42 → 3016.24] And she will literally go read the synopsis.
[3016.24 → 3016.60] Yeah.
[3017.44 → 3019.06] She told me she wanted to catch up.
[3019.26 → 3021.66] She wanted to watch the new season when it came out.
[3021.72 → 3025.68] So she just read the Wikipedia page for every episode of the previous season to get caught
[3025.68 → 3025.90] up.
[3026.44 → 3031.64] And I was like, that's like, I guess it's similar to watching it passively when you're also,
[3031.64 → 3033.10] doing another thing.
[3033.10 → 3035.06] Honestly, you probably absorb more of that way.
[3036.54 → 3039.68] You absorb more of a certain aspect of it.
[3039.82 → 3040.02] Yes.
[3040.28 → 3044.14] So she has a very, very different way of consuming content than I do.
[3044.46 → 3050.44] And so who are you, Mr. Paul, to tell my wife that she's not allowed to watch your movie
[3050.44 → 3051.96] the way that she wants to watch it?
[3052.50 → 3053.28] No, go screw yourself.
[3053.28 → 3055.00] Like, no one asked you.
[3055.40 → 3056.28] How dare you?
[3056.70 → 3056.92] What?
[3056.98 → 3057.66] I didn't ask.
[3057.74 → 3058.44] I didn't ask him.
[3058.58 → 3059.20] I don't need his permission.
[3059.22 → 3060.32] He has kind eyes.
[3060.68 → 3062.68] You tell him to screw himself.
[3063.04 → 3065.46] Well, look, I'm not in general.
[3065.62 → 3067.14] Just about this specifically.
[3067.64 → 3069.96] Who are you to tell me how to read my book?
[3070.34 → 3071.96] Who are you to tell me how to watch my movie?
[3072.38 → 3073.24] It's my movie now.
[3073.62 → 3074.64] I paid you for it.
[3075.32 → 3075.54] True.
[3075.54 → 3076.54] And you know what?
[3076.62 → 3081.68] If you were creating your art on your own platform at no cost to the consumer, if you
[3081.68 → 3083.22] were distributing it for free, you know what?
[3083.24 → 3088.00] You could make the argument that you have a lot more say with respect to how it gets consumed.
[3088.16 → 3094.34] But as soon as you were doing it for money, for a paycheck, you kind of lose some of your
[3094.34 → 3096.32] artist rights as far as I'm concerned.
[3098.40 → 3100.14] You were compensated already.
[3100.64 → 3102.14] I don't owe you anything.
[3102.14 → 3107.70] So would you be in favour of a feature that allowed you to click it on to do this movie
[3107.70 → 3108.24] in black and white?
[3110.82 → 3113.04] I mean, there's nothing that would prevent you from doing that already.
[3113.38 → 3116.20] You could probably do that through your NVIDIA control panel, honestly.
[3117.22 → 3118.98] So no, that feature already exists.
[3119.38 → 3121.28] I mean, like if it's just like a Netflix feature, and you're like, punk.
[3123.70 → 3125.54] I doubt people would demand that.
[3125.68 → 3127.48] I personally would never use it.
[3128.02 → 3129.78] But I mean, we could talk about it the other way too.
[3129.78 → 3132.40] Automatically colourizing black and white content.
[3133.08 → 3134.04] That's actually even.
[3134.26 → 3135.00] That's more applicable.
[3135.34 → 3141.00] It's not only more applicable, but it's also kind of more interesting because it would have
[3141.00 → 3141.68] to take liberties.
[3142.00 → 3143.52] Like the machine would have to just guess.
[3144.24 → 3144.58] Absolutely.
[3145.12 → 3146.24] And so, no.
[3146.54 → 3149.82] If there was demand from users, no, I would be supportive of that.
[3149.82 → 3151.12] I would never use it.
[3151.50 → 3156.32] I would, I would, if someone, if I was in a room and someone else was trying to turn
[3156.32 → 3158.50] on any of this crap, I'd be mad.
[3158.66 → 3160.96] And I'd be like, look, can we watch it properly, please?
[3161.06 → 3162.88] But you watch every movie with subtitles on.
[3162.88 → 3172.06] To a lesser degree now, because I switched to a BFGD and the local dimming causes subtitles
[3172.06 → 3174.12] to have a halo around them that I find very distracting.
[3174.28 → 3180.40] So, no, actually, my most recent binge show, which was the puppet one, Dark Crystal.
[3180.86 → 3184.22] My most recent binge show, no, I turned off the subtitles after the finish.
[3184.22 → 3186.68] You know, I kind of, after you told me you did that, I started doing it a little more
[3186.68 → 3186.96] often.
[3187.54 → 3189.06] And I, I like it.
[3189.32 → 3189.74] You, okay.
[3189.92 → 3190.68] You miss differently.
[3191.14 → 3191.50] Yes.
[3191.70 → 3192.76] Because you're looking down here.
[3192.90 → 3193.10] Yeah.
[3193.36 → 3194.98] And you're not taking in the full shot all the time.
[3194.98 → 3197.42] I would never turn on subtitles for a movie I'd already seen.
[3197.80 → 3198.02] Yeah.
[3198.14 → 3202.12] Like if I was re-watching Empire or something, I wouldn't turn on subtitles.
[3202.12 → 3203.80] I think sometimes I would.
[3204.44 → 3207.66] Because I tend to miss the same things again and again on repeat viewings.
[3207.66 → 3210.84] It's like my attention span has ebbs and flows, and they're predictable.
[3211.20 → 3215.36] So, like 25 minutes in, I think about something else, and I miss the same line every time.
[3215.36 → 3220.28] And subtitles actually do tend to have information that is not always easily distinguishable by
[3220.28 → 3220.52] ear.
[3220.68 → 3226.06] Like you'll hear a line in the background that you couldn't understand, or you'll see it
[3226.06 → 3228.52] and like, oh, that's what, oh, that's what they said.
[3228.66 → 3233.76] By that same token, I hate that with subtitles, there are different languages available, German
[3233.76 → 3234.28] and Spanish.
[3234.90 → 3238.16] English, it's not just English subtitles, it's closed captioning.
[3238.28 → 3243.48] So you get Ending whirring, inaudible, door clanks.
[3243.48 → 3244.48] I hate that.
[3244.48 → 3246.44] I wish there were just subtitles.
[3246.56 → 3247.86] Part of it is just getting used to it.
[3248.06 → 3252.24] Like my mom is hard of hearing, so we always had subtitles on in our house.
[3253.46 → 3259.18] So I just accepted subtitles as part of, well, if I want to watch TV at all, then there's
[3259.18 → 3259.74] subtitles on.
[3259.98 → 3261.80] Have you ever seen a movie with subtitles you don't want?
[3261.80 → 3269.68] I saw Force Awakens in, I believe it was Malaysia when it came out, and there were two sets of
[3269.68 → 3270.20] subtitles.
[3270.20 → 3271.02] Yeah, that's pretty distracting.
[3271.04 → 3273.68] Taking up like a third of the screen, both in languages that I couldn't read.
[3273.92 → 3279.88] But, but Disney has no right to tell me that I can't have two sets of subtitles if I see
[3279.88 → 3280.12] fit.
[3280.12 → 3281.64] That's my, that's my point.
[3281.76 → 3286.96] And I just, I know I had an argument with the, with the camera guys today about the
[3286.96 → 3290.28] upcoming resurrection of Channel Super Fun, which we're taking our sweet time with, I'm
[3290.28 → 3291.40] sorry, but it'll happen eventually.
[3291.96 → 3295.70] And we were choosing between a couple of different cameras, because it's time to upgrade our
[3295.70 → 3296.80] gear for like running gun.
[3296.80 → 3299.76] We don't really have any running gun cameras that are not manual focus and stuff.
[3300.40 → 3304.04] And between the two camera option, between the two cameras, one of them is two pounds
[3304.04 → 3306.48] heavier, but has 4K 60 FPS recording.
[3306.88 → 3309.10] And the other one is two pounds lighter, but does not.
[3309.16 → 3310.56] It only does 4K 30 FPS.
[3311.28 → 3314.88] And I said, okay, well, we have to consider the very real possibility that we're going to
[3314.88 → 3316.32] be shooting at 60 FPS.
[3317.08 → 3321.46] And they were both like upset to the point where one of them threatened to refuse to shoot
[3321.46 → 3321.64] it.
[3322.22 → 3324.08] If we, if we shot at 60 FPS.
[3324.08 → 3324.94] I know who did that.
[3324.94 → 3333.94] And my response was, well, it doesn't actually matter what you think because you're not the
[3333.94 → 3334.24] customer.
[3334.76 → 3338.42] You know, you look at the other channels that are like dudes goofing around and like having
[3338.42 → 3343.38] fun or whatever, you know, so I'm Mr. Beast would be obviously the, the archetypal channel
[3343.38 → 3345.88] like that right now, because they are just absolutely killing it.
[3345.92 → 3347.28] And they shoot everything at 60 FPS.
[3347.68 → 3352.16] For some types of content, it's at a level of realism that is kind of nice.
[3352.48 → 3352.84] Yeah.
[3352.84 → 3356.78] I mean, I'm a 24 frames per second kind of person, but for some things, especially if
[3356.78 → 3360.72] it's a first person view kind of how to like, here's my hand grabbing this thing, that wrench.
[3361.20 → 3361.76] That's great.
[3362.00 → 3366.00] And the point that I made to them was like, look, you can have your opinion.
[3366.34 → 3369.06] Personally, I prefer 30 FPS to 60 FPS too.
[3369.14 → 3374.64] And that's why Linus Tech Tips will be 30 FPS for the foreseeable future, except in cases
[3374.64 → 3377.02] where we're doing something more artsy, and it's going to be 24.
[3378.10 → 3387.64] But you make content for the viewer, not for your, your, your own smug, self-satisfied
[3387.64 → 3390.88] patting yourself on the back in a lot of cases.
[3390.88 → 3394.06] And you have to consider what the viewer is going to expect.
[3394.18 → 3395.48] There's a limit to that though.
[3395.98 → 3399.24] Because you can look at the kind of things that are popular on YouTube and you can look at
[3399.24 → 3401.78] some of these creators, and you'll be like, I would never stoop that level.
[3401.86 → 3404.42] I don't even this, I don't see what people see in this video, but it's getting so many
[3404.42 → 3404.64] views.
[3404.76 → 3405.50] How that's true.
[3405.70 → 3406.80] You won't make that content.
[3406.90 → 3409.66] I'm not allowing my judgment to be clouded.
[3409.66 → 3414.10] And quite frankly, that is the way I see it to the point where I'm going to have the frame
[3414.10 → 3416.52] rate of the video be the hill that I'm going to die on.
[3417.10 → 3418.34] That's not the content.
[3418.54 → 3419.84] Content is king.
[3419.96 → 3426.34] The frame rate of the video is nothing more than a viewer comfort element.
[3426.72 → 3432.10] And if people are expecting, if the audience for this type of video is expecting 60 FPS,
[3432.86 → 3434.44] then they should get 60 FPS.
[3434.70 → 3434.96] I don't know.
[3435.04 → 3436.38] I feel like there's going to be jarring.
[3436.58 → 3438.58] There's a medium is the message type of thing there.
[3438.58 → 3445.00] And the other thing too, is that this is the direction things are heading, whether snobby
[3445.00 → 3446.70] movie people like it or not.
[3447.38 → 3454.24] For two generations now, Google's Pixel phones have recorded video at 60 FPS by default, given
[3454.24 → 3455.34] enough ambient light.
[3456.00 → 3458.00] By default, without asking the user.
[3459.38 → 3460.96] So that's something that is happening.
[3461.28 → 3466.10] We already have complaints on our videos about, well, other tech channels record in 60.
[3466.10 → 3470.52] Why are you guys too budget and ghetto to like record at 60 FPS?
[3471.10 → 3473.10] Because we did it for aesthetic reasons.
[3473.22 → 3474.46] I'm sorry you wouldn't understand.
[3475.10 → 3476.44] Recording on the phone is completely different.
[3476.52 → 3477.54] Not necessarily.
[3478.74 → 3479.54] Not necessarily.
[3479.68 → 3484.32] Because how much of the content that we produce and consume is driven by mobile now?
[3484.66 → 3485.06] No, but what?
[3485.06 → 3486.28] And where's that trend line going?
[3486.28 → 3489.36] The things that you're capturing on your own personal device when you're taking a video
[3489.36 → 3491.36] are probably more conducive to being in 60.
[3491.58 → 3493.40] But it's about what people are used to.
[3493.40 → 3493.92] They're not cinematic.
[3494.20 → 3500.54] If people are used to watching a channel super fun style of content at 60 FPS and our channel
[3500.54 → 3502.54] is 30, I have seen it.
[3502.80 → 3505.54] People are like, oh, why is the frame rate so low?
[3505.58 → 3505.94] It sucks.
[3506.48 → 3507.12] Oh, that could be.
[3507.22 → 3507.56] It sucks.
[3507.64 → 3508.06] It's stutter.
[3508.14 → 3508.30] That could be.
[3508.64 → 3508.80] Yeah.
[3508.98 → 3509.34] For sure.
[3509.34 → 3511.12] For that type of video, that could work.
[3511.30 → 3511.48] Exactly.
[3512.14 → 3516.24] So all I was saying was we need to be open-minded here.
[3516.50 → 3522.08] We need to do some market analysis like a real company, see what people are going to expect,
[3522.20 → 3523.82] and we need to adapt to that.
[3524.24 → 3527.86] And I think I made my point, but you never know.
[3527.86 → 3532.02] And the next generation of creators are mobile.
[3534.68 → 3535.04] Yeah.
[3535.66 → 3536.64] Oh, yeah, for sure.
[3536.66 → 3537.28] Nick's over there.
[3537.68 → 3537.86] Yeah.
[3538.12 → 3539.02] What can I do for you, Nick?
[3540.14 → 3543.58] That's why YouTube is like totally redoing all their stuff, to keep up with TikTok.
[3544.04 → 3544.38] Oh, yeah.
[3545.30 → 3546.72] Did you guys talk about the new hat?
[3547.36 → 3547.90] Yeah, we did.
[3548.12 → 3549.54] It was actually the first thing we talked about.
[3549.72 → 3550.16] Oh, heck yeah.
[3550.22 → 3552.94] Did you talk about all the stuff that's been restocked on the store?
[3553.38 → 3554.20] No, actually.
[3554.20 → 3557.84] So LTTstore.com, guys, we've got underwear back in stock.
[3557.86 → 3558.82] In all sizes.
[3559.38 → 3561.82] We've got all the hardware series shirts.
[3562.02 → 3562.74] Except for that one.
[3562.80 → 3563.76] Except for GPU.
[3565.00 → 3565.44] Sorry.
[3565.66 → 3567.62] So CPU, RAM, hard drive.
[3568.24 → 3569.48] We've got all of those.
[3569.62 → 3570.12] Yeah, fan.
[3570.22 → 3570.62] I like that one.
[3570.86 → 3572.26] Those are in stock in all sizes.
[3572.52 → 3577.18] We've got restocks coming for Constellation, as well as Tech Link shirt.
[3578.74 → 3582.74] Water bottles are obviously in stock in all colours, I think.
[3582.74 → 3582.96] That was perfectly synced.
[3583.06 → 3583.70] Did you see that?
[3583.78 → 3584.20] That was great.
[3584.20 → 3584.46] Beautiful.
[3584.96 → 3587.34] Wickets are in stock now in all sizes.
[3587.36 → 3587.58] Dang it.
[3587.86 → 3589.40] My ice broke free.
[3590.18 → 3591.68] Yeah, Wickets in stock in all sizes.
[3591.78 → 3593.14] I wouldn't expect that to last that long.
[3593.22 → 3594.98] We've already sold through over 30% of them.
[3595.04 → 3597.24] We've only had them in stock for a week and a half.
[3597.62 → 3597.66] More than half now.
[3597.66 → 3598.20] More than half?
[3598.34 → 3598.54] Yeah.
[3598.78 → 3599.30] Of Swacked?
[3599.42 → 3599.62] Yeah.
[3599.90 → 3600.52] Oh, all right.
[3600.68 → 3601.08] There you go.
[3601.22 → 3603.22] So move fast if you want to Swacked in your size.
[3603.22 → 3607.20] I recommend Swacked plus Stealth Hoodie.
[3607.20 → 3611.30] With the way the Stealth Hoodie fits a little snug and Swacked fits a little looser.
[3611.52 → 3615.68] So together with a little bit of wind breaking from Swacked, it's actually super warm.
[3616.00 → 3617.44] I was walking my daughter to school.
[3617.54 → 3619.20] It was apparently five degrees out.
[3619.46 → 3624.02] And I had LTT shirt, Stealth Hoodie, and Swacked over top.
[3624.02 → 3625.92] And I was like, this is fine.
[3626.38 → 3627.18] Now we need a beanie.
[3627.40 → 3627.56] Yeah.
[3627.74 → 3628.46] Now we just need a beanie.
[3628.46 → 3629.56] Stack on, Stack off.
[3629.72 → 3630.28] The Swacked.
[3630.48 → 3633.74] Swacked does fit on the tighter side.
[3634.20 → 3635.90] So just be mindful of the sizing.
[3636.08 → 3637.20] You just said the opposite of that.
[3637.26 → 3638.48] No, I said Swacked fits tighter.
[3639.10 → 3640.56] No, you said Stealth fits tighter.
[3640.60 → 3641.38] Oh, Swacked fits tighter.
[3641.90 → 3642.70] Swacked fits tighter?
[3643.04 → 3643.92] Yeah, you're just tiny.
[3643.92 → 3645.46] You should be a small, and you wear medium.
[3645.68 → 3646.06] Oh, whatever.
[3646.64 → 3647.02] All right.
[3647.08 → 3649.86] Well, I'm going to let James go because I think his carpool is like leaving.
[3650.12 → 3650.94] I didn't carpool.
[3651.42 → 3652.08] Oh, you didn't?
[3652.18 → 3652.34] Okay.
[3652.54 → 3653.76] No, I'm house sitting in Maple Ridge.
[3653.90 → 3655.70] I'm finding out what it's like to live in the Burns.
[3655.92 → 3658.76] You know, I grew up in Maple Ridge, right?
[3659.48 → 3660.34] You don't think it's a burn?
[3660.52 → 3661.32] In the ghetto.
[3662.28 → 3663.54] I grew up from Mission, dude.
[3663.70 → 3663.98] Oh, yeah.
[3664.14 → 3664.34] It's even farther.
[3664.52 → 3665.18] Oh, that's right.
[3665.26 → 3666.78] Why did I hire a Mission kid?
[3667.96 → 3669.86] If I'd known you were from Mission, I might not.
[3670.28 → 3670.64] Honestly.
[3671.12 → 3674.68] So my family never watches my videos, so they'll never see this.
[3675.16 → 3682.36] But I thought it was a huge mistake when my mom sent my youngest sibling to high school
[3682.36 → 3682.82] in Mission.
[3683.02 → 3683.58] No offence.
[3683.58 → 3686.50] What year did that person graduate?
[3688.10 → 3688.86] They're way younger.
[3689.00 → 3690.16] They're like nine years younger than me or something.
[3690.16 → 3690.50] Yeah, okay.
[3690.50 → 3691.00] Never mind then.
[3691.00 → 3691.16] Yeah.
[3691.24 → 3691.94] No, no, no, no, no.
[3692.06 → 3693.88] But like, I don't know.
[3693.98 → 3695.92] Maybe it was just his group of friends.
[3696.14 → 3696.36] Nope.
[3696.66 → 3698.14] But they just like...
[3698.14 → 3698.36] Nope.
[3698.36 → 3700.12] I don't know, man.
[3700.18 → 3700.72] They just...
[3700.72 → 3702.68] Just seemed like...
[3702.68 → 3703.62] It was like...
[3703.62 → 3704.78] Like, I don't know.
[3705.24 → 3706.08] They just...
[3706.08 → 3707.96] It's like, hey, what can we light on fire?
[3708.08 → 3709.06] And I'm just like...
[3709.06 → 3710.60] So you hit a bullet on fire.
[3710.64 → 3712.28] I like lighting things on fire, too.
[3712.34 → 3713.94] But it just seemed dumber when they did it.
[3713.96 → 3714.26] I don't know.
[3714.84 → 3715.80] Dumber than a bullet?
[3715.80 → 3719.28] There's a legendary story of someone from my high school where they tried to have like
[3719.28 → 3721.90] a relatively small party, like 30 people or something.
[3722.24 → 3722.40] Yeah.
[3722.52 → 3726.76] One person from Mission found out, and 200 Mission kids showed up and trashed the house.
[3727.22 → 3728.02] I was there.
[3728.42 → 3728.82] You were?
[3728.90 → 3729.20] No.
[3729.60 → 3730.68] But I have trashed the house.
[3730.70 → 3731.58] I've never been that surprised.
[3731.58 → 3733.24] I've been at a house-trashing party.
[3733.34 → 3736.64] I don't know what the context was, but it was like, we're not living here anymore and
[3736.64 → 3739.18] we're allowed to smash it somehow and there are no adults here.
[3741.02 → 3741.74] Oh, wow.
[3741.90 → 3743.10] Screw my security deposit.
[3743.56 → 3747.00] See, I've never been to any party, so that sounds doubly horrifying to me.
[3747.18 → 3747.66] Super chats?
[3747.78 → 3748.92] Yeah, let's do some Super chats.
[3750.38 → 3753.16] Gavin Fair says, please give credit to Optimum.
[3753.22 → 3754.20] He found this data.
[3755.22 → 3755.46] Yep.
[3756.28 → 3758.04] He's talking about the Peace Corps thing.
[3758.22 → 3759.50] There's like four YouTubers there.
[3759.68 → 3759.90] Oh.
[3760.10 → 3761.00] Optimum was the one who made it.
[3761.00 → 3763.78] Did I not list the, uh, did I not list them?
[3763.80 → 3767.26] I think he, maybe you used his real name and not his tag or handle.
[3767.26 → 3767.80] Okay, cool.
[3768.58 → 3769.44] Credit to Optimum.
[3770.04 → 3772.44] Sander says, hey, Linus, are you a weed smoker?
[3772.78 → 3774.56] No, I am not, in fact, a weed smoker.
[3775.22 → 3775.84] Good question.
[3775.96 → 3778.02] Oh, a second Super chat from Sander.
[3778.18 → 3778.64] All caps.
[3779.02 → 3780.50] I'm sure you are a weed smoker.
[3781.08 → 3781.38] Why?
[3781.50 → 3782.28] Why would you think that?
[3782.58 → 3784.04] I've had a lot of people conclude that I...
[3784.04 → 3785.22] It's because you're wearing this hat and hoodie.
[3785.54 → 3786.62] It's because your eyes are red a lot.
[3786.64 → 3787.06] It's not.
[3787.52 → 3789.64] My eyes are red a lot because I'm tired AF.
[3789.64 → 3789.76] Yeah.
[3789.76 → 3790.00] Yeah.
[3791.00 → 3799.96] Um, I've had people assume that I am both, um, high on weed and high on coke.
[3799.96 → 3804.56] And sometimes they draw the same conclusion or those two conclusions from the same video.
[3804.78 → 3807.10] And I think it is...
[3807.10 → 3810.04] People obviously just don't know what people on drugs look like.
[3810.04 → 3814.88] Because if you're going to go those two different directions from one video, you ain't...
[3814.88 → 3816.44] Yeah, you just got no idea what's going on.
[3817.24 → 3820.88] Um, Robert says, hello from Ohio Linux Fest.
[3821.00 → 3822.10] Oh, that's pretty cool.
[3822.10 → 3822.28] Ohio.
[3822.28 → 3824.02] Long live free open source.
[3824.16 → 3825.62] Congrats on the Peace Corps top 10.
[3825.70 → 3826.00] Thank you.
[3826.46 → 3828.60] Uh, Jeremy says, did Luke end up wearing red to Blazon?
[3828.68 → 3830.12] Luke is sick as a dog.
[3830.12 → 3831.60] He's so sick that he didn't go to Blazon.
[3831.62 → 3832.58] Yeah, he's not at Blazon.
[3832.70 → 3833.70] That sucks, man.
[3834.30 → 3838.70] Adam says, uh, is it worth upgrading to a 2080 from a 1080?
[3839.30 → 3839.70] I don't know.
[3839.76 → 3843.72] It depends on if the games that you want to play are not running as fast as you'd like them.
[3843.72 → 3844.88] Because it's definitely faster.
[3845.14 → 3847.62] Did you guys talk about Diablo 4 got announced or something?
[3847.62 → 3848.58] We did not talk about Diablo 4.
[3848.58 → 3848.96] I didn't know that.
[3848.98 → 3849.76] It's on Tech Linked today.
[3849.86 → 3850.64] Go watch Tech Linked.
[3850.74 → 3851.24] Yeah, there you go.
[3851.40 → 3855.32] Um, Gavin says, shout out to Optimum for finding this data.
[3855.42 → 3856.38] It's all in caps this time.
[3856.94 → 3860.62] Uh, Sage says, wanted to let you know I got your mineral oil parts at LTX this year,
[3860.70 → 3862.54] and they are now on my Plex server.
[3862.88 → 3864.64] I thought you'd like to know what happened to them.
[3864.74 → 3865.10] Nice.
[3865.30 → 3865.52] Wow.
[3865.78 → 3866.06] Nice.
[3866.66 → 3868.12] Gavin says, Linus is a boomer.
[3868.16 → 3870.08] Why is Gavin sending all these super chats?
[3870.16 → 3872.48] Hey, Gavin wants us to have his money.
[3872.66 → 3873.00] Thank you.
[3873.00 → 3873.72] I'm not a boomer.
[3873.78 → 3874.44] I'm a millennial.
[3874.50 → 3875.00] He's a millennial.
[3875.04 → 3875.98] He's an elder millennial.
[3876.42 → 3880.52] I have my avocado toast with genuine tuna, okay?
[3880.62 → 3883.08] Not the tuna that's like 60% other fish.
[3883.58 → 3883.88] All right.
[3884.58 → 3885.98] You're not even an elder millennial.
[3886.48 → 3887.94] No, I'm like smack in the middle.
[3888.24 → 3888.68] 86.
[3888.98 → 3889.58] Well, it's not the middle.
[3889.82 → 3891.12] I think it is, isn't it?
[3891.78 → 3892.00] What?
[3892.22 → 3893.14] Yeah, if it's a melt.
[3893.90 → 3894.80] A true millennial.
[3894.82 → 3897.60] Okay, first you get your multi-grain bread, okay?
[3898.02 → 3898.46] All right?
[3898.76 → 3901.86] You butter the one side, you know, free-range butter or whatever.
[3901.86 → 3903.60] Then you throw your tuna on there.
[3903.60 → 3904.54] You're describing a tuna melt.
[3904.70 → 3905.70] You throw your tuna on there.
[3905.94 → 3907.34] You put your cheddar cheese.
[3908.10 → 3910.46] You put that sucker on the frying pan.
[3910.54 → 3911.18] You cover it up top.
[3911.26 → 3912.82] Your cheese melts nice and fast, okay?
[3913.04 → 3914.60] Then you take your fresh sliced avocado.
[3914.74 → 3915.40] You put that on top.
[3915.48 → 3916.64] Get a little bit of salt on there.
[3917.80 → 3919.34] You've never had brunch in Vancouver, have you?
[3919.38 → 3920.44] That's not avocado toast.
[3920.50 → 3921.68] That's just tuna melt with avocado.
[3922.54 → 3923.62] It's toasted, is it not?
[3924.40 → 3925.20] Not technically.
[3925.20 → 3926.30] What do you mean not technically?
[3926.64 → 3928.22] I, do I have to make you one?
[3928.44 → 3928.78] Okay?
[3928.84 → 3929.08] Yeah.
[3929.24 → 3930.84] Because it is brown on the bottom.
[3931.58 → 3932.84] That is, okay.
[3934.00 → 3935.94] It's toasted via frying pan.
[3936.26 → 3937.62] Okay, can we have more Super Chats, please?
[3940.64 → 3943.14] James is like, I have real avocado toast to go find.
[3943.58 → 3944.44] For dinner.
[3944.98 → 3945.70] Thanks, Adam.
[3945.82 → 3947.12] Thanks, PVT Topol.
[3947.12 → 3953.50] Ilya, I'd be extremely grateful if you stopped using brand skins in on-demand sponsored reviews.
[3953.90 → 3959.12] I'd be extremely grateful if you were chill with me wanting my devices to be protected from incidental scuffs and scratches.
[3961.22 → 3965.90] Tommy Gunn says, was watching old vids and noticed that your company grew up and got a bit boring.
[3967.88 → 3968.28] Thanks.
[3968.70 → 3969.12] Okay.
[3969.62 → 3971.32] They have me to thank for that.
[3971.74 → 3973.34] Matthew says, love your channel, guys.
[3973.40 → 3974.24] Keep up the good work.
[3974.24 → 3977.76] Mike, watched over all your videos over the last year.
[3977.86 → 3978.04] Wow.
[3978.42 → 3984.04] I want a 9900K on an RG Hero, 30 gigs of RAM, and an VGA 2080 Ti FTW3 hybrid card.
[3984.56 → 3990.52] Well, it's too bad you didn't show up at the micro centre in California like a couple of weeks ago in Tustin.
[3991.12 → 3993.86] Yeah, because we basically gave away one of those.
[3993.94 → 3994.86] Video coming this weekend.
[3995.10 → 3996.16] Don't miss it.
[3996.30 → 3996.88] Oh, my God.
[3996.88 → 3998.84] I just realized I'm supposed to go to the movies in one hour.
[3999.06 → 4002.70] Captain Pepper says, when can we get that hot LTP desk pad from last video?
[4002.70 → 4004.44] Uh, soon TM.
[4004.56 → 4005.00] Soon TM.
[4005.02 → 4005.52] See you later.
[4005.70 → 4005.96] All right.
[4006.00 → 4006.38] See you, James.
[4006.48 → 4007.02] Bye, James.
[4007.14 → 4011.38] Uh, Born says, long time archive watcher, first time watching live.
[4011.62 → 4011.84] Sweet.
[4012.54 → 4017.86] Austin says, would you consider using a Lightroom export benchmark as a real workload that, uh,
[4018.14 → 4019.82] oh, yeah, that's a pretty good idea.
[4019.90 → 4021.26] Yeah, we would consider using that.
[4021.66 → 4022.44] That's a very good idea.
[4022.54 → 4022.76] Thank you, James.
[4023.48 → 4025.74] I'm going to forget, though, because I'm in the middle of live-streaming.
[4025.74 → 4030.02] Maybe, like, tweet at Anthony or something, because he sort of dictates what our, uh,
[4030.02 → 4032.08] test, um, suite is now.
[4032.54 → 4034.10] Andrew says, finally able to catch live.
[4034.20 → 4035.86] Been wanting to ask for nearly a year now.
[4035.96 → 4038.70] There's a keyboard clicking noise during the intro just after Swamp Butt.
[4039.14 → 4040.50] I need to know what that is.
[4041.28 → 4041.82] Oh, wow.
[4041.88 → 4045.06] We created that intro, like, five years ago or something like that.
[4045.18 → 4046.58] I have no idea.
[4046.78 → 4047.66] I'm so sorry.
[4047.74 → 4049.66] It could very well be a keyboard clicking noise.
[4050.38 → 4052.48] It could very well be you typing in the background.
[4052.48 → 4056.58] It could very well be me typing in the background while it is, like, recording something.
[4057.10 → 4059.08] Uh, Bobby says, leave the hat the way it is.
[4059.16 → 4059.76] Oh, dang it.
[4060.06 → 4060.70] All right, I'll put it back.
[4061.64 → 4063.88] Uh, Adam slashes that Tech Link logo.
[4065.38 → 4066.88] Um, thanks, Blitz Fab.
[4066.94 → 4067.60] Thanks, Thomas.
[4068.74 → 4070.34] Uh, thanks, Little Shadows.
[4071.10 → 4071.94] Thanks, Seth.
[4073.02 → 4077.12] Um, any idea when the DOG Rig Reboot winners are announced?
[4077.12 → 4081.04] We're actually shooting DOG Rig Reboot next week, so if you don't know about it already,
[4081.04 → 4082.98] uh, you probably didn't win.
[4083.06 → 4084.56] I'm so sorry, just a lazy bastard.
[4085.22 → 4086.98] Uh, Cole says, forget interlacing.
[4087.14 → 4090.54] With 2K, 4K high-refresh monitors maxing out video cards, why not make a setup where each
[4090.54 → 4091.72] card handles a separate display?
[4092.36 → 4097.18] So, it's complicated because they still have to share data, um, between their VRAM, so
[4097.18 → 4099.86] you still run into SLI scaling issues, so it's not going to help.
[4100.68 → 4104.88] Um, sup, nerds, take my money, visit LTT Store, says B Wasabi.
[4105.64 → 4106.00] Sup.
[4107.00 → 4107.90] Uh, Little Shadows.
[4108.04 → 4109.08] Thanks for the super chat.
[4109.08 → 4112.48] Uh, Rainbow says, 90s call, they want their bad haircut back.
[4112.76 → 4113.74] Well, yeah, well, you know what?
[4114.06 → 4117.96] Grade 3 called, they want their improper use of the word there back.
[4118.36 → 4121.22] T-H-E-I-R, sucker, not T-H-E-R-E.
[4121.92 → 4122.22] Yeah.
[4123.40 → 4123.76] I don't know.
[4123.84 → 4127.78] I get, I get kind of, I get kind of, uh, confrontational when I wear my hat like this.
[4127.78 → 4129.02] I think it might be time to go home.
[4129.04 → 4129.30] Yeah.
[4129.38 → 4132.68] Uh, Seth says, you can show your analytics on how much you make in each video or anything
[4132.68 → 4133.60] about your income.
[4133.60 → 4136.50] Um, it's complicated, so it's not quite that simple.
[4136.62 → 4138.10] Yes, you can show certain things.
[4138.38 → 4142.00] Like, I believe you can actually show the overall number, but it's as you drill down into
[4142.00 → 4143.74] it that YouTube gets really cagey about it.
[4144.28 → 4145.14] Don't quote me on that.
[4145.22 → 4147.04] I don't actually know that there's anything in the contract.
[4147.16 → 4148.30] I just know that they don't like it.
[4148.76 → 4151.38] Uh, Robert says, was wondering what you think of my gaming PC.
[4151.38 → 4153.28] It's, uh, got a 9500 GT.
[4153.50 → 4156.04] Hey, it's not about the car you drive.
[4156.16 → 4157.20] It's about how you drive it.
[4157.84 → 4163.30] Um, Held says, super chats are basically paid, paid Twitter Q&A.
[4163.92 → 4165.78] Yeah, pretty much, I guess.
[4166.18 → 4167.16] I don't know that I think about it.
[4167.82 → 4171.58] Uh, Martin says, would you mind giving a shout-out to Rockfish Games and supporting their
[4171.58 → 4172.78] Kickstarter of Ever space 2?
[4172.96 → 4176.94] We're not going to run out and support a Kickstarter of a game just because, like, we have no idea
[4176.94 → 4180.32] what the finished game is like, but I guess, effectively, you got it.
[4180.32 → 4184.38] Um, but we do not endorse it, though.
[4184.52 → 4185.30] Thanks, Shalier.
[4185.84 → 4190.16] Phil Wood says, insomnia, ad jingles are the worst thing, and a lot of voiceovers.
[4190.36 → 4192.86] Narrators can also get on the nerves I support via other means.
[4193.32 → 4196.06] I have no idea what you're talking about, Phil, but thanks for the super chat.
[4196.56 → 4199.62] Uh, Andrew says, I want to test my motherboard, but the CPU hasn't arrived yet.
[4199.70 → 4200.62] Can I test it without the CPU?
[4200.94 → 4201.30] No.
[4202.06 → 4206.46] Uh, Eric, should I, as a YouTube Premium member, accept when YouTube doesn't notify me about
[4206.46 → 4209.48] new content when I've hit the bell and subscribed, or should I be raising a stink because
[4209.48 → 4210.38] I'm now a paying customer?
[4210.48 → 4214.58] What a great question that I would love to have had a longer conversation with my co-host
[4214.58 → 4214.84] about.
[4215.38 → 4216.54] Um, I don't know.
[4216.64 → 4220.44] I feel like I'm more entitled to complain when I'm paying for a service versus it being
[4220.44 → 4220.94] ad-supported.
[4221.04 → 4222.12] It's effectively the same thing.
[4222.16 → 4225.20] You're paying with your time, or you're paying with your money, which are effectively the
[4225.20 → 4225.60] same thing.
[4225.66 → 4226.48] Time equals money.
[4226.48 → 4228.62] We all know the famous equation.
[4229.26 → 4234.08] Um, but yeah, no, I would say that you're more entitled to raise a stink.
[4234.18 → 4238.78] I mean, I complain about G Suite because my reminders don't frigging work, and I'm a paying
[4238.78 → 4239.62] customer for that.
[4239.68 → 4242.70] Whereas free users of Google Assistant, they get their reminders working.
[4243.64 → 4246.28] Um, Tommy Gunn says, where'd the Taxonomic chairs go to?
[4246.42 → 4248.96] Vertical sent us over these RGB ones, and they're RGB.
[4249.22 → 4250.12] So like, what's up?
[4250.12 → 4255.06] Um, Drake, for a faster playback channel, uh, Tech Quicker.
[4255.46 → 4256.50] Yeah, I like that.
[4257.42 → 4260.26] Um, Robert says, I, for one, watch Tech Quickie at 2x speed.
[4261.02 → 4261.42] That's good.
[4261.98 → 4265.04] Nico says, love your Southern, love from your Southern neighbour in Seattle.
[4265.62 → 4268.82] Um, any plans to make a long sleeve shirt, preferably in black?
[4269.44 → 4271.40] I think we're still, oh, we're still okay.
[4272.06 → 4273.74] I, I, I think I know the story here.
[4273.84 → 4279.78] So our t-shirts are all American Apparel and American Apparel does not have just like a
[4279.78 → 4283.98] simple long sleeve t-shirt effect, like a long sleeve shirt.
[4284.66 → 4290.32] Um, and so we won't be able to do one until we've found what we consider to be an equivalent
[4290.32 → 4290.88] replacement.
[4291.10 → 4295.84] And that may end up looking like us replacing our t-shirts as well, but we will not settle
[4295.84 → 4298.90] for anything less than what people have come to expect from us.
[4299.04 → 4300.68] So that's why we haven't done one yet.
[4300.80 → 4304.80] Honestly, the long sleeve shirts that we did before in the past where they were printed on
[4304.80 → 4309.66] like Hands or whatever are some of the most disappointing pieces of merch for people to wear up to me.
[4309.66 → 4313.12] Not because I don't appreciate their support, but just because I hate that I took their
[4313.12 → 4313.72] money for it.
[4314.06 → 4316.44] Uh, the printing just doesn't hold up over time.
[4316.78 → 4318.74] The, the cuffs don't hold up over time.
[4318.74 → 4323.94] Like this stealth hoodie has been worn and worn and worn, and it's still got all the elastic
[4323.94 → 4324.20] in it.
[4324.24 → 4325.28] Like that matters.
[4325.58 → 4331.28] Whereas like those Hands long sleeves, they, they get all like kind of sort of, um, uneven
[4331.28 → 4332.84] around the edges of the cuff and stuff.
[4332.88 → 4333.54] I really hate it.
[4333.54 → 4335.70] Um, thanks Liam.
[4336.32 → 4336.68] Thanks.
[4337.18 → 4338.88] Wait, uh, thanks Kato.
[4338.88 → 4345.66] Did you know that watching a video at two times in terms of watch minutes still counts
[4345.66 → 4346.62] as the full watch minutes?
[4346.66 → 4347.26] I did know that.
[4347.58 → 4350.98] So we'd be better off actually uploading everything at half speed and having you guys
[4350.98 → 4351.42] double it.
[4351.42 → 4358.58] Um, Burgle says about the Netflix thing, why is there no outrage about TV channels showing
[4358.58 → 4360.94] movies with commercial cuts interrupting the pace for instance?
[4361.04 → 4361.64] Yeah, exactly.
[4362.12 → 4362.54] Exactly.
[4362.82 → 4368.54] I don't think any of the artists, um, think that that's the best way to consume their movie.
[4369.04 → 4371.98] Uh, I guess they're just, they're over it at this point.
[4372.34 → 4372.76] Um.
[4372.76 → 4373.16] Okay.
[4375.44 → 4376.50] Let me have a look here.
[4377.50 → 4378.14] Oh man.
[4378.28 → 4382.16] The problem with when we start super chats is people start super chatting up a storm
[4382.16 → 4385.54] and like, I can't, uh, I don't know if I can finish them all.
[4385.62 → 4386.12] There's too many.
[4386.80 → 4389.70] Um, Ilya says you enable subtitles for movie in your native language.
[4389.76 → 4389.88] Yeah.
[4389.92 → 4392.18] Sometimes I don't like it to have a movie that loud.
[4392.76 → 4394.04] So I'd like to turn on subtitles.
[4394.80 → 4397.44] Um, Daniel says looking forward to the Netflix feature.
[4397.56 → 4398.10] There you go.
[4398.10 → 4399.54] Uh, NYC.
[4399.54 → 4403.02] I've been waiting for the project author's case to come out for a while.
[4403.70 → 4405.70] Uh, maybe you could use your power to talk to the creator.
[4406.14 → 4406.46] Um.
[4407.60 → 4408.20] Oh man.
[4408.36 → 4410.84] I, I don't, I don't think I ever even talked to the creator.
[4410.96 → 4412.70] I think it was Ivan, and he doesn't work here anymore.
[4413.40 → 4416.98] Uh, QWERTY says you should try uploading a couple of videos at 60 where it's just double
[4416.98 → 4417.48] 30 FPS.
[4417.58 → 4419.46] We actually did that once and nobody noticed.
[4419.88 → 4421.62] They were like, oh wow, this is sick.
[4422.96 → 4426.44] And it was just, we had just, uh, interpolated the extra frames.
[4427.84 → 4428.22] Um.
[4428.22 → 4431.20] Um, I can't, I wish I could find that video because it was hilarious.
[4431.38 → 4434.98] But we did it so stealthily that it's like not in the title of the video or anything.
[4435.12 → 4439.72] We just did it as an internal test to be like, like, can people actually tell the difference?
[4439.90 → 4440.12] No.
[4440.26 → 4441.28] Turns out they actually cannot.
[4442.00 → 4442.38] Um.
[4443.22 → 4443.48] Oh.
[4443.66 → 4447.20] Joey says I emailed the help of the Linus Tech Tips store about a size exchange
[4447.20 → 4448.62] a week ago and haven't gotten a response.
[4448.90 → 4448.92] Uh.
[4448.92 → 4451.00] Well, fortunately Nick is standing right there.
[4451.38 → 4451.62] Yeah.
[4451.70 → 4453.40] I'll have to look back at that.
[4453.58 → 4453.94] Um.
[4454.08 → 4454.34] So.
[4454.34 → 4455.80] If you can tweet at me with your order number.
[4456.08 → 4456.80] It's for Joey.
[4457.24 → 4461.24] Tweet at Nick LMG with your order number, and he will definitely get it sorted out.
[4461.34 → 4461.56] Yeah.
[4461.56 → 4462.30] Um.
[4462.44 → 4463.78] Zach's saying thanks Zach.
[4464.14 → 4464.92] Thanks Joshua.
[4466.02 → 4466.44] Um.
[4466.68 → 4469.62] Stanley says can you do an update video of the PG35VQ?
[4470.14 → 4470.36] Uh.
[4470.36 → 4472.02] Maybe attempt fixes with the flickering or scan.
[4472.06 → 4473.74] I don't have any flickering issues with it.
[4474.42 → 4478.64] Honestly, my only issue with it has been that, um, it doesn't go to sleep sometimes.
[4478.64 → 4483.94] So I have seen people talking about it, but like I don't have the problem.
[4484.26 → 4485.70] So I don't really know how to address it.
[4485.82 → 4486.80] I, I, yeah.
[4488.32 → 4488.68] Uh.
[4488.76 → 4489.44] Plex Addict.
[4489.60 → 4492.74] Plex Addict says unpaid or ZFS for large storage.
[4492.86 → 4494.38] If you don't need speed, unpaid.
[4494.50 → 4498.56] If you do need speed, then you'll probably have to go ZFS and deal with the extra, um,
[4499.00 → 4500.02] hassle that comes with that.
[4500.10 → 4502.42] Like having to upgrade in big chunks of drives at a time and stuff.
[4503.06 → 4504.90] Corey says thoughts on 9900KS.
[4505.04 → 4505.78] Got a video coming.
[4505.78 → 4506.14] Uh.
[4506.14 → 4508.62] Overall, if you already wanted the fastest of the time,
[4508.64 → 4510.22] the fastest, it actually looks like a great deal.
[4510.30 → 4511.38] It's only like 25 bucks more.
[4511.82 → 4516.10] And you're getting what is effectively like a top 30% 9900K.
[4516.50 → 4518.52] So compared to what Silicon Lottery was charging for.
[4518.72 → 4520.58] Hans says get you shots, kid.
[4520.88 → 4522.56] Let's see if I still have the mark from this morning.
[4525.02 → 4525.76] Well, whatever.
[4525.88 → 4528.30] My muscles sore because that's where my flu shot went this morning.
[4528.38 → 4529.18] Why did I do that?
[4529.92 → 4530.32] Um.
[4531.70 → 4532.18] All right.
[4532.76 → 4534.52] That's all, that's all I can do.
[4534.70 → 4535.42] That's all I can do.
[4535.46 → 4536.28] I'm so sorry, guys.
[4536.28 → 4536.80] Uh.
[4536.80 → 4537.42] See you next week.
[4537.50 → 4538.58] Same bad time, same bad channel.
[4538.98 → 4539.48] Thanks for listening.
[4539.48 → 4539.78] Bye-bye.
[4540.22 → 4541.02] See you next week.
[4541.36 → 4541.50] ми Little nasty samples.
[4542.14 → 4542.96] Bye-bye.
[4543.56 → 4547.96] Bye-bye.
[4548.50 → 4550.28] Bye-bye.
[4556.44 → 4556.70] Thanks for listening to you next week.
[4557.22 → 4559.64] Bye-bye.
[4559.72 → 4561.24] Bye-bye.
[4561.28 → 4561.38] Bye-bye.
[4561.44 → 4562.46] Bye-bye.
[4566.54 → 4567.90] Bye-bye.
