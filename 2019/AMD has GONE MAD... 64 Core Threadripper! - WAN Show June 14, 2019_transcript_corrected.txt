[0.00 → 3.40] Peter was researching something the other day,
[3.54 → 9.06] and one of our videos that was me on Tech Wiki teaching something
[9.06 → 13.66] was in the thread of the person teaching something to Peter.
[13.90 → 14.98] And I was like, this is nuts.
[16.00 → 16.32] Ready?
[16.62 → 16.84] Yep.
[20.06 → 22.26] Hey, welcome to the WAN Show, guys.
[22.30 → 25.26] We've got a great show for you today, I hope.
[25.62 → 25.82] Yeah.
[25.82 → 29.14] I actually haven't seen this guy in like three weeks.
[29.14 → 30.08] Something like that.
[30.16 → 32.72] Yeah, he's been like cavorting about in Asia.
[33.02 → 33.24] Yeah.
[33.50 → 34.88] Perfectly innocent, though.
[35.28 → 38.06] No weird kinds of tourism.
[39.52 → 42.66] It was Taiwan, not Thailand.
[44.22 → 44.74] Taiwan.
[46.72 → 47.32] Anyway.
[47.32 → 48.30] Let's roll the intro.
[55.70 → 56.70] Oh, boy.
[59.14 → 64.32] Oh, man.
[65.40 → 67.16] This is not going to be a good show.
[69.80 → 72.92] We are off to a real rough start here.
[73.24 → 73.54] Yeah.
[73.72 → 74.12] Yeah.
[74.64 → 74.96] Yeah.
[75.20 → 78.16] But that's okay, because it's not about how you start.
[78.16 → 79.60] It's about the big finish.
[79.60 → 88.34] Would you believe I'm trying to hire a new writing staff?
[90.54 → 92.04] Would you believe that?
[92.24 → 97.14] Is part of the process how many dick jokes you can come up with during the interview?
[97.42 → 98.20] No, no.
[98.32 → 99.16] Definitely not.
[99.44 → 102.46] There are bonus points for saying that they think I'm funny, though.
[102.58 → 104.08] Only one person did it today.
[104.08 → 104.16] Okay.
[104.56 → 108.90] So, you know, I want to commend that one individual on their honesty.
[109.62 → 110.50] Oh, yes.
[110.58 → 110.78] Yeah.
[110.88 → 115.50] I want to commend them on their honesty because everyone else, they're like closet thinking
[115.50 → 117.54] I'm funny because I know everyone thinks I'm funny.
[117.64 → 118.00] Of course.
[118.08 → 118.24] Yeah.
[118.26 → 118.84] Not so much.
[118.90 → 119.14] All right.
[119.18 → 119.38] Fine.
[119.44 → 119.58] Fair.
[119.90 → 120.34] That's fine.
[120.34 → 120.64] Yeah.
[120.64 → 127.90] No, I'm actually finally finishing up the writer search that I started four months ago
[127.90 → 128.66] or something like that.
[128.72 → 132.38] I've been travelling so much that I just have not had time to do it properly.
[132.70 → 140.10] And I would rather just have it take too long and go through everyone fairly versus, you know,
[140.14 → 144.62] trying to spread it out over, you know, many weeks.
[144.84 → 148.34] And then, like, the people that I evaluated at the beginning, maybe I'm not using the same
[148.34 → 149.54] standards as the one at the end.
[149.54 → 152.06] Like, I wanted to be able to sit down and, like, do it in big chunks.
[154.24 → 156.76] And so we've started our interviews.
[157.00 → 161.14] We're not quite done interviews yet, but we're looking to make a decision pretty soon.
[161.14 → 168.14] So we're going to be increasing the writing team size here by, like, 40%, 60%.
[168.78 → 168.98] I don't know.
[168.98 → 169.80] How many people are you hiring?
[169.84 → 170.88] Math is not a strong point.
[170.98 → 171.54] Two to three.
[171.80 → 172.64] Oh, wow.
[172.94 → 174.14] I thought this was one position.
[174.24 → 174.58] No.
[175.46 → 176.06] Holy cow.
[176.12 → 176.30] Yeah.
[176.36 → 176.96] Two to three.
[177.66 → 179.28] Are you that I've...
[179.28 → 180.84] Are you expanding channels?
[181.70 → 183.42] Because that's a lot of writers to add on.
[184.30 → 186.08] So we haven't talked about anything yet.
[186.34 → 186.70] Okay.
[186.88 → 191.46] But actually, so you don't attend Linus Media Group Monday morning meetings anymore because
[191.46 → 192.82] you are not an employee of Linus Media Group.
[192.82 → 195.96] I still get the emails and I poke through them sometimes just to make sure, like, the power
[195.96 → 197.82] isn't going to go out or something without me knowing.
[197.82 → 201.48] I actually gave, like, a big speech on Monday.
[201.70 → 203.26] So I was talking about...
[204.34 → 206.98] Or wait, should we talk about some of the topics we're going to have today or should I just get
[206.98 → 207.24] right into...
[207.24 → 207.52] You know what?
[207.52 → 208.34] I'll get right into this.
[208.38 → 209.36] We'll talk about topics in a minute.
[209.52 → 209.72] Yeah.
[209.98 → 210.92] This is pretty on point.
[210.92 → 215.20] So I was talking about some of the changes that have been taking place on YouTube lately
[215.20 → 217.68] and how they've affected our channels.
[217.88 → 217.96] Yeah.
[217.96 → 218.14] Yeah, yeah.
[218.18 → 220.16] You know, YouTube won't admit anything.
[220.78 → 221.02] Ever.
[221.20 → 226.04] I've had correspondence with them, not just with my partner manager, who is quite a senior
[226.04 → 231.30] member of the team and who I believe when he tells me, you know, nothing changes or nothing
[231.30 → 235.78] has changed or that it's machine learning and nothing discrete was changed.
[235.78 → 238.98] But that doesn't mean that it isn't always learning and always changing.
[239.46 → 242.86] And I've even gone higher up the food chain than that.
[243.28 → 245.92] And everyone insists we didn't change anything.
[246.06 → 247.16] We tweaked no dials.
[247.24 → 248.36] But I just...
[248.36 → 249.90] I have a hard time...
[249.90 → 254.98] I have a hard time buying it because we know from the other things that YouTube says, like,
[255.04 → 264.42] I went to Brand cast and YouTube's talking about, you know, raising authoritative voices when
[264.42 → 268.90] it comes to trying to make sure that they're a platform that promotes credible information.
[269.48 → 275.28] But can you raise an authoritative voice without suppressing another one?
[275.82 → 276.86] You're saying, yes, you can.
[277.02 → 278.02] No, I'm agreeing with you.
[278.04 → 278.60] Ah, I see.
[278.72 → 278.88] Yeah.
[278.90 → 279.96] Because no, you can't.
[279.98 → 280.18] Yeah.
[280.30 → 284.30] You can't elevate something without pushing something else down.
[284.40 → 286.04] That's just the way it works.
[286.14 → 286.86] Especially when...
[286.86 → 287.88] Sorry to jump in here for a second.
[288.04 → 292.10] But YouTube kind of, at this point, like, has the population.
[292.10 → 297.02] Like, they don't really have a ton of expanding more to do other than people getting internet
[297.02 → 300.70] or people getting to the age where they can watch their own YouTube.
[300.70 → 301.30] Fun fact.
[301.40 → 306.86] They're no longer going to report on unique visitor increases anymore.
[307.34 → 307.74] Interesting.
[307.84 → 308.26] Do you know why?
[308.70 → 312.42] Because they're already over 2 billion a month.
[312.72 → 313.56] Oh, my God.
[313.56 → 314.68] So, like...
[314.68 → 314.90] Yeah.
[314.98 → 316.12] So, like, who do you go for now?
[316.14 → 320.72] Nothing that they can do can sound impressive and sound like growth to their shareholders anymore.
[320.72 → 321.62] So, they're just like...
[321.62 → 322.46] Because they have everyone.
[322.50 → 323.32] We're doing great.
[323.54 → 324.12] We're just, like...
[324.12 → 328.72] We can't talk about it anymore, though, because, like, a 0.1% improvement...
[329.74 → 332.74] In fairness to us, it's still 20 million more people.
[332.74 → 332.76] It's still huge.
[332.90 → 333.68] But it's, like, not impressive.
[333.68 → 335.02] It doesn't sound very marketable.
[335.18 → 335.32] Yeah.
[335.42 → 335.56] Yeah.
[335.56 → 335.60] Right?
[335.76 → 335.88] Yeah.
[336.22 → 339.30] So, like, if you're taking this platform that, like, yes, it's expanding.
[339.46 → 340.40] Don't get me wrong here.
[340.46 → 341.22] I understand that.
[341.44 → 345.78] But if you're taking this platform that has, like, this kind of set amount of users, if you're...
[345.78 → 347.20] I understand it's not how it works.
[347.24 → 347.80] Just hold on.
[347.80 → 353.04] Um, if you start pumping someone, you have to reduce push for other people.
[353.04 → 355.30] There's only so many eyeballs.
[355.52 → 358.16] And, you know, there's been problems on YouTube...
[358.16 → 359.96] We understand there are more eyeballs all the time.
[359.98 → 361.06] ...that have been identified.
[361.64 → 369.12] Like, the black hole thing with conspiracy theories or, you know, flat earth or fake moon landing or anti-vaxxing or whatever else.
[369.46 → 374.80] You know, there are things that are relatively low-hanging fruit that...
[376.14 → 377.20] Hold on a second.
[377.80 → 378.50] One moment, please.
[380.62 → 381.60] Technical difficulties.
[383.60 → 389.94] I'm just checking to see if...
[389.94 → 390.46] Okay, cool.
[390.56 → 393.54] So, in February, YouTube demonetized anti-vax channels.
[394.18 → 396.58] Facebook, YouTube to suppress anti-vaxxer content.
[396.72 → 398.38] This was from PC Mag on March 7th.
[398.38 → 398.52] Good.
[398.60 → 399.90] So, there are other sources.
[400.04 → 401.34] So, I don't have to be the source for this.
[401.38 → 403.20] So, YouTube is suppressing anti-vax content.
[403.20 → 405.50] Now, so there's...
[405.50 → 406.12] Oh, no.
[406.12 → 410.50] So, there are certain things that I completely agree with because that's incredibly dangerous.
[410.92 → 412.04] Anti-vax content.
[412.14 → 415.48] Not suppressing it because anti-vax content is super stupid.
[415.48 → 419.36] So, there are things that I agree with.
[419.36 → 423.06] But there's also potential collateral damage.
[423.06 → 427.66] So, one of the problems that was identified on social media in general, not just on YouTube,
[428.06 → 429.78] is that once you watch...
[429.78 → 430.78] Like, if you go...
[430.78 → 432.00] Okay, for loss.
[432.44 → 432.64] You know?
[432.98 → 438.66] You show a friend some stupid Tai Lopez video because you're like...
[438.66 → 439.70] That guy.
[439.78 → 439.94] You know?
[439.98 → 441.04] The guy with the knowledge.
[441.36 → 441.58] You know?
[441.58 → 441.76] The grudge.
[441.78 → 442.54] Remember that guy?
[442.58 → 443.38] And they're like, no, no.
[443.40 → 444.64] I'm like, this guy.
[445.60 → 448.08] All of a sudden, you're recommended.
[448.48 → 449.34] Your ads.
[449.34 → 455.08] It's just full of all those bloody get-rich-quick YouTube gurus.
[455.28 → 455.38] Yeah.
[455.50 → 456.68] And it's so obnoxious.
[456.68 → 456.88] Okay.
[457.12 → 462.48] So, there's this problem that's been identified online, on social media in general, with echo
[462.48 → 462.92] chambers.
[463.36 → 468.80] And with one search for a given topic, all of a sudden, just putting...
[468.80 → 470.04] You might slightly be interested in this?
[470.70 → 471.14] Yeah.
[471.34 → 472.88] Or not just interested even.
[473.00 → 474.14] Just curious.
[474.48 → 476.58] And all of a sudden, it's put in front of your face.
[476.58 → 483.42] And when you're not as media savvy, you might just see something on Facebook and go, oh,
[483.46 → 484.32] oh, it's credible.
[484.44 → 485.46] It's printed in black and white.
[485.46 → 488.26] Like, it's the craziest thing in the world.
[488.74 → 494.86] But that same, just because something is printed in black and white doesn't mean that
[494.86 → 495.22] it's true.
[495.30 → 501.20] That same education that's been trying, that people have been trying to give to people
[501.20 → 505.70] since the freaking 1800s is still a big deal today.
[505.70 → 513.22] And so, what happens is you end up in this kind of this death spiral of fake moon landing,
[513.70 → 517.12] flat earth, whatever, just from watching one stupid video.
[517.34 → 523.32] And a lot of the people that perpetuate these conspiracy theories speak in a way that may
[523.32 → 529.70] not sound authoritative to you, the educated viewer, but to other people, apparently does.
[529.70 → 529.74] Yes.
[530.22 → 532.50] So, anyway, one of the theories...
[532.50 → 537.42] It might not sound believable, but they're trying to be authoritative almost always.
[537.86 → 540.04] So, like, it makes sense that it might sound that way.
[540.40 → 540.80] Exactly.
[540.80 → 541.26] That's the intent.
[541.26 → 549.22] So, one of the theories we had was that in order to prevent, you know, these kinds of
[549.22 → 556.12] echo Chambéry things from happening, YouTube might have been deemphasizing more niche content
[556.12 → 559.60] and then pumping stuff that's safer.
[560.40 → 562.30] Now, that was the theory.
[562.60 → 564.34] And we were kind of like, oh, well, we're tech.
[564.66 → 565.70] We're kind of niche.
[565.80 → 567.66] We're also a niche within tech.
[567.66 → 574.74] Like, quite frankly, a lot of the content that we upload would have absolutely no place
[574.74 → 580.36] on a more mainstream tech content channel like Marquez's.
[580.60 → 581.80] Like, come on.
[582.06 → 583.96] It wouldn't make sense for him to do.
[584.16 → 585.80] His audience wouldn't like it.
[586.02 → 591.04] And it makes sense that it goes up on our channel, gets fewer views, et cetera, et cetera,
[591.12 → 591.46] et cetera.
[592.02 → 596.70] So, we were looking at it going, okay, well, maybe part of this is we're just more niche.
[596.70 → 601.04] And so, people, because we noticed the biggest dip in viewership was on our back catalogue.
[601.62 → 605.84] So, maybe what's happening is instead of people watching one of our new videos and then getting
[605.84 → 612.24] bombarded with our massive back catalogue of 4,000 videos, something that had a huge benefit
[612.24 → 617.48] for us and generated a lot of subscribers, maybe instead of that, well, they're being
[617.48 → 623.18] fed some Marquez and some Austin and some Gamers Nexus and whatever else.
[623.22 → 625.78] And to be clear, we love all those guys and that's cool.
[625.78 → 626.40] Fine, whatever.
[626.78 → 630.54] But it definitely did have an impact on our viewership over the course of this year.
[631.46 → 635.78] So, from there, I actually had some really great conversations at the YouTuber, YouTube
[635.78 → 636.44] Creator Summit.
[636.92 → 640.36] And Derek from Verulamium posted a great video.
[640.42 → 641.22] Did you watch that, by the way?
[641.24 → 641.52] Yeah, I did.
[641.82 → 646.84] Posted a great video on his theory about why his Shade ball video went viral.
[646.84 → 653.90] And basically, his theory, it's funny because in some ways, I give YouTube so much credit.
[654.68 → 658.36] Like the puppet masters have all these different strings they're pulling on.
[658.60 → 664.24] His theory was so simple that I forget whose razor it is, where the simplest solution is.
[664.38 → 664.46] Occam?
[664.78 → 665.54] Is that Occam's razor?
[665.54 → 666.14] I think so.
[666.26 → 666.54] Anyway.
[666.72 → 667.44] Or Occam, yes.
[667.44 → 669.96] Yeah, the simplest solution is usually the correct one.
[669.96 → 678.62] His theory was as simple as YouTube has taken the click-through ratio that you get with
[678.62 → 681.96] the clickiness of your title and thumbnail.
[682.52 → 690.32] And it has shifted the axis so that a smaller difference in click-through ratio gives it a
[690.32 → 693.46] greater proportion, more promotion on the site.
[693.46 → 697.08] And then a small difference the other way gives you way less.
[697.40 → 701.26] So instead of it being kind of linear, if your click-through ratio is great, you're like
[701.26 → 702.16] way up here.
[702.26 → 705.14] And if your click-through ratio sucks, you're like way down here.
[705.84 → 710.66] So that was another interesting theory because we have also had our click-through ratio decrease
[710.66 → 717.16] this year as we've moved away from more clickbaity titles and clickbaity thumbnails, which
[717.16 → 720.70] sucks, but it's something that we've committed to our audience that we're going to do.
[720.70 → 725.50] It just means that we'd really appreciate it if you guys clicked the bell and then watch the
[725.50 → 726.36] video right away.
[726.60 → 728.46] That actually makes a huge difference.
[728.62 → 732.42] Even if you're not going to actually watch it right now, if you drop what you're doing,
[732.84 → 734.56] start the video, put your phone back in your pocket.
[734.76 → 735.76] I don't care.
[736.20 → 740.82] But if you just click and just go about the rest of your day, go watch it later, doesn't
[740.82 → 741.14] matter.
[741.82 → 748.50] That initial click-through ratio basically determines everything about how that video is going
[748.50 → 748.96] to perform.
[748.96 → 754.44] As far as we can tell, that's Derek's theory, and it's so simple, it might just be right.
[755.00 → 760.30] So anyway, LTT has actually struggled in terms of viewership this year.
[760.40 → 765.44] It's back up in the last four to six weeks or so, and we are tracking a perfect direction
[765.44 → 766.02] right now.
[766.52 → 772.92] But coming back to our all-hands meeting this Monday, this was a very, very long story.
[773.02 → 773.94] Wow, we're 12 minutes in.
[773.94 → 776.54] I'm engaged right now.
[776.62 → 780.14] Coming back to our all-hands meeting this Monday, I actually did stand up in front of
[780.14 → 780.34] everyone.
[780.44 → 783.16] You know when I stand up during the Monday morning meeting, I just usually...
[783.16 → 783.70] It's a little serious.
[783.88 → 784.82] Good news, everyone.
[785.02 → 785.22] Yeah.
[785.22 → 791.52] I basically went, look, this is something that I've really struggled with, not just professionally,
[791.82 → 792.74] but also personally.
[793.00 → 795.66] You know, trying to figure out what am I doing?
[795.72 → 796.64] What am I doing wrong?
[796.72 → 797.84] What can I do to fix it?
[798.34 → 801.24] Does the audience just plain not like me anymore?
[802.08 → 805.18] Is PC hardware losing its sex appeal?
[805.18 → 810.74] Like I was trying to identify what it was because unless I know what the problem is, I cannot
[810.74 → 811.34] fix it.
[811.78 → 819.52] And what I ultimately came to was that there was a combination of audience sentiment things
[819.52 → 820.74] that did need to be addressed.
[820.86 → 825.56] You know, talking to the audience directly about things like doing less offensive thumbnails
[825.56 → 826.74] and titles, that kind of thing.
[826.82 → 831.18] You know, making sure we're appending the brand and the product wherever that makes sense.
[831.22 → 831.90] Things like that.
[832.18 → 833.16] I thought that was part of it.
[833.16 → 837.52] I also thought that some kind of change, whether a manual change or an algorithmic change on
[837.52 → 839.32] YouTube's side, was part of the problem.
[839.70 → 846.42] And then the bigger conclusion that I came to is that maybe if we build our business correctly,
[846.62 → 847.92] it just doesn't matter.
[849.16 → 858.46] Because where LTT has struggled this year, Tech Linked has actually picked up nearly all of
[858.46 → 863.86] the lost watch time, nearly all the lost viewership and lost revenue.
[864.86 → 867.00] And I kind of went, well, Tech Linked was an accident.
[867.72 → 874.22] After the failure of Channel Super fund and a bit of a stagnation period that we went through
[874.22 → 878.44] with Tech Quickie, to be clear, Tech Quickie's going really well right now.
[878.44 → 880.62] So massive shout out to John and Dennis.
[880.98 → 881.00] Yay.
[882.80 → 890.56] So after kind of stagnation period for Tech Quickie, I was full like triple down mode on LTT.
[890.80 → 892.04] I was like, okay, we just throw all the...
[892.04 → 897.42] LTT has literally 10 times as much staff as any other channel, even now.
[897.42 → 905.34] But what I realized is if I can't ultimately control it, well, something that I can control
[905.34 → 907.40] is this diversification strategy.
[907.52 → 908.70] So Tech Link happened by accident.
[909.28 → 912.82] My homeboy, Riley, lost his job because his company went out of business.
[913.18 → 916.58] And I was like, yo, dog, I've been trying to hire you forever, you twit.
[916.66 → 917.48] Get out of the dumpster.
[917.68 → 918.92] Get out of the dumpster.
[919.18 → 919.94] Come on.
[920.06 → 921.28] Get on over here.
[921.28 → 921.32] Come on.
[921.72 → 924.62] And, you know, Riley, he's driven to do the tech news.
[925.20 → 926.20] I think we all know this.
[926.20 → 929.58] He's driven to do the tech news for the people.
[930.20 → 931.66] So we created Tech Linked.
[932.14 → 936.42] And Tech Linked was an accidental, complete success.
[937.16 → 939.16] Like that channel is freaking awesome.
[939.26 → 940.70] I get my tech news from Tech Linked.
[940.94 → 942.32] Like it's awesome.
[942.88 → 943.84] You get your tech news from Tech Linked?
[943.88 → 944.20] Nice.
[944.42 → 946.06] I genuinely watch it all the time.
[946.62 → 948.52] I just like, yeah, it's great.
[948.84 → 950.20] And clearly a lot of people do.
[950.32 → 954.74] Tech Linked regularly gets half a million views a video, even when it only has like 700,
[954.74 → 955.88] 800,000 subscribers.
[956.20 → 957.10] Like it's outstanding.
[957.42 → 957.56] Yeah.
[957.64 → 958.68] It's such a great show.
[959.94 → 965.84] Anyway, so I was looking at it going, well, maybe we're just thinking about this too narrowly.
[966.34 → 970.90] Maybe the answer here is to broaden the net instead.
[970.90 → 979.84] Because that way, every time Tech Linked struggles a little bit and needs a fresh coat of lipstick.
[980.38 → 984.36] Or, you know, every time LTT loses its groove.
[984.46 → 989.60] Or every time Tech Quickie runs out of things people need explained, as if that'll ever happen.
[989.60 → 994.42] Something else can carry some of that weight, and we can spread things out.
[994.76 → 997.80] The other really cool thing about Tech Linked is that it doesn't rely on me.
[998.60 → 998.80] Yeah.
[998.96 → 1005.88] At the beginning of Tech Linked, I was far and away the top performing host on that channel in terms of the views that each video would get.
[1005.88 → 1009.02] Like of the top 10, I was all but one of them.
[1009.10 → 1011.72] And then of the bottom 10, I wasn't in any of them.
[1011.86 → 1014.92] Like I was clearly, my face was driving more clicks.
[1015.32 → 1016.60] Fascinating fact.
[1016.80 → 1019.94] Over the last couple of months, I've actually been on the bottom half.
[1019.94 → 1022.70] Which I think is great.
[1022.80 → 1023.14] It is.
[1023.38 → 1027.52] Because it means that Riley and James, I mean, we've had Dennis host.
[1027.62 → 1029.00] We've had Alex host.
[1029.14 → 1030.04] We've had Yvonne host.
[1030.76 → 1037.64] It means that people are connecting with the team and with the brand.
[1038.02 → 1042.96] Not just Linus Sebastian, the person who quite honestly can't do everything forever.
[1042.96 → 1053.40] And so basically, I had this sort of magic moment where I went, okay, LTT is starting to recover, which is good.
[1053.62 → 1054.60] We can hire.
[1057.14 → 1058.22] Dodged a bullet there.
[1058.82 → 1060.82] But also, maybe it's not the future.
[1061.24 → 1063.38] Maybe it's just one part of the future.
[1063.64 → 1071.74] And we can bring people more types of tech content that bring them happiness in other tech ways.
[1071.74 → 1074.12] And that's been one of the great things about the channels that you guys have expanded.
[1074.30 → 1085.68] Is like, if you liked Linus Tech Tips and you don't want an education channel or a news channel or a channel of us playing with weird toys and being very cringy, you could just keep watching Linus Tech Tips.
[1085.98 → 1086.78] It didn't matter.
[1087.04 → 1091.10] And Linus Tech Tips will, as far as I can tell, carry on just as well as it has.
[1091.38 → 1093.10] And other channels will keep carrying on.
[1093.50 → 1094.62] And you're maybe expanding.
[1094.76 → 1095.58] What are you expanding to?
[1095.80 → 1097.10] Are you saying at this point?
[1097.22 → 1098.14] I don't know.
[1098.14 → 1110.10] So it was fascinating because normally when you enter the hiring process, you might go in and say, I really want someone with JavaScript experience or whatever.
[1110.62 → 1113.54] You set out what your job requirements are.
[1113.62 → 1113.76] Yeah.
[1113.76 → 1122.80] Well, I am just looking at all my applicants, and I'm figuring out who the best applicants are.
[1123.00 → 1126.18] And then I will create programming.
[1126.40 → 1132.20] It's actually, there's some a little bit larger companies than Flow plane that do this in a lot of different spaces.
[1132.20 → 1138.08] You try to find people that are extremely talented and passionate, and you go like, well, I'll make you super valuable.
[1138.26 → 1138.72] Let's go.
[1139.64 → 1144.84] It's actually, if you can manage it, it's a very apparently cool way to do things.
[1144.84 → 1154.98] So not necessarily just the new people, but there's people who are already here that the new people could come and alleviate some of their workload, and maybe they could pursue a passion project.
[1155.42 → 1159.00] James and Riley have been really into Talk Linked.
[1159.56 → 1160.36] Do you know Talk Linked?
[1160.40 → 1160.52] Yeah.
[1160.74 → 1160.98] Okay.
[1161.12 → 1166.10] Totally different from Tech Linked because it's just one topic instead of many topics, and it's long instead of short.
[1166.34 → 1166.48] Yeah.
[1166.48 → 1171.44] And honestly, the last, the first episode, kind of rough.
[1171.86 → 1173.94] The second episode, a lot better.
[1174.32 → 1184.60] And the I happened to eavesdrop on sort of debrief conversation, and they had identified basically everything that they needed to fix.
[1184.60 → 1187.90] And they're like, they're iterating, and they're going through that creative process.
[1188.00 → 1190.48] And I'm looking at it going like, wow, like this is great.
[1190.70 → 1193.60] This is me witnessing the machine working.
[1194.56 → 1194.80] Working, yeah.
[1194.80 → 1196.76] And, but they don't have time.
[1197.78 → 1198.18] Right.
[1198.28 → 1203.40] So James has produced, I think, four LTTs in the last two weeks because Jake's been on vacation.
[1204.60 → 1208.54] Anthony's been tied up preparing some of our really cool boots that we're going to have for LTX.
[1208.64 → 1210.02] He's got 10 years of PC gaming.
[1210.02 → 1215.38] He has 10 gaming rigs to configure, build, and benchmark and set up demos on.
[1216.20 → 1216.98] Like, ugh.
[1217.22 → 1218.48] So he's been super busy.
[1219.02 → 1219.90] Alex has been tied up.
[1219.94 → 1223.52] He's actually putting together our, like, maker space next door right now.
[1223.64 → 1223.66] Yeah.
[1223.66 → 1228.44] Like, so James, we've been leaning on him really heavily, but that means he hasn't had a ton of time for Talk Linked.
[1228.44 → 1231.18] So, you know, we could bring these new people in.
[1231.18 → 1235.22] They could lift some of that load, and then we can kind of spread things out.
[1235.22 → 1236.48] We can figure out what makes sense.
[1236.68 → 1237.04] I mean, as long-
[1237.04 → 1238.32] Make each person a little bit more agile.
[1238.74 → 1246.20] As long as we keep a really great team dynamic here and as long as we stay passionate about tech, whether it's news.
[1246.42 → 1247.38] You know, news is important, Riley.
[1247.82 → 1249.66] Whether it's news or whether it's something else.
[1249.66 → 1250.06] Yeah.
[1250.06 → 1250.26] Yeah.
[1252.26 → 1253.44] I guess, yeah.
[1253.54 → 1255.68] We're going to do more stuff, though.
[1256.00 → 1258.42] You know, I'm not done yet.
[1261.02 → 1261.42] Cool.
[1261.56 → 1262.76] You know, I was thinking about it.
[1262.94 → 1266.88] Not thinking about actually quitting, but thinking about phasing myself out.
[1267.94 → 1268.88] You know, it's...
[1268.88 → 1270.78] You've been sort of talking about it for a while.
[1270.78 → 1271.04] Yep.
[1271.22 → 1272.84] I was really thinking about it.
[1272.84 → 1275.00] I mean, you and I chatted about it back at CES, I think.
[1276.00 → 1279.94] And I've just been kind of considering whether I'm done.
[1281.08 → 1283.66] You know, and when the channel's not performing well.
[1284.12 → 1286.58] Because at the end of the day, it's not up to me.
[1287.10 → 1288.38] It's not up to you.
[1288.48 → 1290.82] It's not up to the rest of my staff.
[1291.06 → 1296.94] Like, you know, everyone here could go, oh, no, Linus, you know, we really want you to keep being the face of the company and the face of the channel.
[1296.94 → 1307.46] And I'd go, well, yeah, that's great, but if the audience doesn't want it, then, like, it's a nice sentiment, but it actually doesn't matter at all.
[1307.46 → 1308.94] You could pivot to...
[1309.64 → 1310.80] Hear me out.
[1311.38 → 1314.38] You could pivot to, like, vlogs of you doing...
[1314.38 → 1316.16] Hey, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[1316.40 → 1318.28] I'm not saying daily vlogs or anything.
[1318.96 → 1319.48] Just...
[1319.48 → 1321.10] What, am I going to be a family vlogger now?
[1321.12 → 1323.36] No, that actually isn't where I was going to go with it.
[1323.80 → 1324.28] Hold on.
[1325.40 → 1326.16] Hold on.
[1326.94 → 1330.64] You really enjoyed your, like, RC car hacking electronic stuff.
[1331.18 → 1331.52] Yeah.
[1332.04 → 1333.50] The gun's going a little bit further away.
[1334.38 → 1346.94] Just, like, you're experimenting with technologies in ways that you actually want to and just, like, fumbling around and trying different things instead of trying to go with this, like, hyper entertainment or hyper...
[1347.70 → 1349.30] So we've done a bit more of that lately.
[1349.52 → 1349.74] ...news or whatever.
[1350.12 → 1350.44] I know.
[1350.72 → 1350.96] Yeah.
[1350.96 → 1355.14] But having a little bit even more free-form and being, like, off the line of executives channel.
[1355.20 → 1358.08] So it could be, like, pretty separated if you wanted to.
[1358.22 → 1359.68] Here's one problem with that.
[1359.68 → 1362.92] At 4,000 videos in.
[1362.92 → 1368.56] I've run most of the experiments that I was kind of, like, wondering about when I was in high school.
[1368.68 → 1369.02] Yeah, yeah.
[1369.10 → 1371.46] I have so much more resources now than I used to.
[1371.86 → 1378.32] You know, one of the things I really struggle with right now is just having too many resources.
[1378.32 → 1382.02] Like, people got mad when I upgraded my gaming rig.
[1382.82 → 1383.82] So there are a couple problems.
[1383.96 → 1386.08] One is that people don't think critically sometimes.
[1386.08 → 1389.70] So they were like, why are you calling a Titan graphics card slow?
[1390.06 → 1396.60] So the thing is, depending on what generation of Titan is, it is, it could be really slow by today's standards.
[1396.88 → 1397.18] It is.
[1397.46 → 1404.80] It could be literally the fastest card on the market all the way down to slower than literally anything that NVIDIA currently sells.
[1404.80 → 1408.20] Like, ugh.
[1408.62 → 1418.44] And then, you know, you've got people that are frustrated because, for me, upgrading my personal rig is as simple as showing up at NVIDIA for a sponsored project, of all things,
[1418.84 → 1426.18] and saying that I've been finally finding time to play games lately, but Anna 1800 is, like, chugging on my system.
[1426.58 → 1428.58] And them just being like, what?
[1429.22 → 1430.68] I'll put a graphics card in the mail.
[1430.82 → 1432.32] People get mad about that.
[1432.32 → 1440.88] And I get it, but the flip side of it is, the alternative, I guess, is for me to just not tell you.
[1441.90 → 1442.38] Yeah.
[1442.46 → 1448.24] Because you could be an influencer 1 20th my size.
[1448.28 → 1452.08] And I use the term influencer as, like, the word.
[1452.08 → 1455.00] So, let's say an online content creator.
[1455.20 → 1456.90] Literally 1 20th my size.
[1457.20 → 1461.72] And getting something like a graphics card sent to you is easy.
[1462.18 → 1467.08] I mean, even when we started Linus Tech Tips, we had 200,000 subscribers.
[1467.64 → 1467.80] Yeah.
[1467.88 → 1473.48] And one of the first videos that Luke worked on when we went indie was our review of the first GTX Titan.
[1474.00 → 1474.14] Yeah.
[1474.14 → 1476.60] Like, it's not like this is new.
[1476.72 → 1478.20] So, the only...
[1478.20 → 1482.02] So, if you're going to get mad at me about it, you're well within your rights.
[1482.20 → 1491.46] But just understand that anyone else out there who is not telling you that they got sampled a card for doing a project or whatever the case may be,
[1491.90 → 1493.38] is probably just not telling you.
[1493.42 → 1494.16] There are exceptions.
[1494.16 → 1497.68] But we believe in transparency, if nothing else.
[1498.12 → 1501.38] Also, it's not for my personal rig.
[1501.90 → 1503.52] It's for a video.
[1504.72 → 1505.62] There you have it.
[1505.94 → 1507.08] So, there's your full disclosure.
[1507.96 → 1508.54] Hey, guys.
[1509.16 → 1510.66] I'm working on my personal rig.
[1511.18 → 1512.62] This video was sent...
[1512.62 → 1514.46] Or, this video card was sent over by NVIDIA.
[1514.68 → 1516.26] This motherboard was sent over by Gigabyte.
[1517.60 → 1518.26] That's it.
[1518.40 → 1520.48] We are fulfilling our obligation.
[1520.48 → 1524.44] And so, if you want me to just say, hey, I'm working on my personal rig.
[1524.52 → 1525.50] Here are the parts I'm using.
[1525.58 → 1526.28] I could do that.
[1526.38 → 1527.48] But I just don't...
[1527.48 → 1529.00] I don't think that's good enough.
[1529.60 → 1530.94] And not just I don't think that's good enough.
[1530.98 → 1532.40] The FCC doesn't think that's good enough.
[1532.54 → 1534.84] So, I mean, they don't have any jurisdiction here.
[1534.86 → 1535.22] Yeah.
[1536.06 → 1536.64] At all.
[1536.96 → 1537.52] And so...
[1537.52 → 1538.98] But it's a good idea to...
[1538.98 → 1540.02] I could just not.
[1540.90 → 1547.34] But for my part, I would rather take a little bit of negativity and just deal with it.
[1547.34 → 1548.82] And there's people that are going to be resentful.
[1548.82 → 1554.30] But I guess my response to them would be, you know, where's your channel?
[1555.12 → 1563.62] Where's your investment in building something so that people want you to show their products on it?
[1563.96 → 1566.84] Like, I'm not saying that anyone can be a YouTuber.
[1567.10 → 1573.62] I'm just saying that you literally won't know unless you're, like, really trying to do it.
[1573.62 → 1575.42] Give it a shot.
[1575.80 → 1577.18] And then should people be...
[1577.18 → 1579.78] Should people resent you if someone sends you a graphics card?
[1580.70 → 1581.28] I don't know.
[1581.92 → 1583.64] Have you heard Taylor Swift's new song?
[1583.78 → 1584.36] I haven't.
[1585.00 → 1585.58] Oh, boy.
[1585.80 → 1586.58] Do I sound like her?
[1586.66 → 1587.52] Please don't tell me I sound like her.
[1587.52 → 1588.14] No, actually.
[1588.26 → 1588.74] No, no, no, no.
[1588.96 → 1590.36] No, no, no, no.
[1590.36 → 1592.68] Stop it.
[1593.26 → 1598.14] That actually ties in really well to what I would say right there is the title of the song is You Need to Calm Down.
[1598.42 → 1599.02] You're being too...
[1599.02 → 1601.62] And then a part of the lyrics is, like, you need to calm down.
[1601.70 → 1602.46] You're being too loud.
[1602.88 → 1604.72] And the whole thing is just, like, leave it alone.
[1604.72 → 1617.88] And this is, I think, one of those kind of situations where, like, he's telling you, I have seen a lot of creators do a lot worse things where they hide it or there's something going on in the background, and they're not communicating that stuff.
[1618.44 → 1622.10] Him saying, like, hey, they sent me this card doesn't mean go buy this card.
[1622.18 → 1622.96] It's the best one.
[1623.06 → 1624.08] No, and I didn't say that.
[1624.18 → 1624.34] No.
[1624.44 → 1626.38] I have never recommended a Titan to anyone.
[1626.56 → 1626.78] No.
[1627.92 → 1628.76] NVIDIA knows that.
[1628.82 → 1629.52] They still sent it.
[1629.66 → 1629.86] Yeah.
[1629.86 → 1632.56] It means, hey, I got this card.
[1632.68 → 1633.66] I might as well use it.
[1633.74 → 1636.52] It's going to fulfill all the things I really care about.
[1637.14 → 1637.52] Sweet.
[1637.84 → 1637.96] Dunk.
[1637.96 → 1640.10] It's literally the fastest card, so.
[1640.52 → 1640.88] Cool.
[1641.46 → 1642.16] Put it in.
[1642.32 → 1642.62] I don't know.
[1642.66 → 1646.58] And people are all over the map because on the one hand, you've got people mad that I'm putting in an RTX Titan.
[1646.94 → 1650.94] And then on the other hand, you've got people mad that, like, what kind of tech influencer are you?
[1650.94 → 1651.96] You're not even running SLI.
[1655.40 → 1655.80] Yeah.
[1656.28 → 1656.68] Yeah.
[1656.78 → 1659.14] You've got too many people in your audience at a certain point.
[1659.14 → 1660.60] You can't please everyone.
[1660.72 → 1660.94] Yeah.
[1661.10 → 1661.66] Yeah, exactly.
[1663.96 → 1665.90] This shirt is kind of pleasing, though.
[1665.96 → 1666.74] We should probably do ad spots.
[1666.96 → 1667.64] Oh, right.
[1667.88 → 1669.94] And surely you mean sponsor spots.
[1670.04 → 1670.50] Oh, right.
[1670.80 → 1671.00] Oh.
[1671.20 → 1679.60] Because our sponsor integrations and placements surely do not compete with YouTube's ad formats.
[1679.74 → 1679.92] Yeah.
[1679.92 → 1682.00] We should do a WAN show on that at some point.
[1682.14 → 1683.80] Why we have to call everything sponsored.
[1683.80 → 1684.82] That would be awesome.
[1685.04 → 1688.08] Just kind of some inside baseball for you, ladies and gentlemen.
[1688.36 → 1689.06] Ridge Wallet.
[1689.46 → 1689.68] Yeah.
[1689.74 → 1690.98] Hey, where's the Ridge Wallet?
[1692.06 → 1694.18] They didn't give us a Ridge Wallet to talk about.
[1697.18 → 1699.88] They might have been hoping mine would be here.
[1700.18 → 1700.80] Oh, shoot.
[1701.02 → 1703.24] But honestly, straight up.
[1703.36 → 1703.98] Hey, Jake.
[1706.10 → 1707.34] Jake Daly drives one.
[1707.82 → 1708.78] Is Brandon getting one?
[1709.64 → 1709.96] Hey!
[1709.96 → 1710.28] Hey!
[1711.28 → 1712.78] Brandon saves the day!
[1713.10 → 1713.28] Yeah.
[1713.28 → 1713.94] Thanks, Brandon.
[1714.14 → 1719.38] So the reason why I don't have mine on me is because I was travelling.
[1719.62 → 1720.76] You didn't lose it, did you?
[1720.76 → 1724.42] And I lose my stuff way too often, and I didn't want to lose it.
[1724.54 → 1725.18] Oh, all right.
[1725.24 → 1725.98] That is why.
[1726.06 → 1727.06] I actually believe...
[1727.06 → 1727.48] See...
[1727.48 → 1729.50] This is why he said that.
[1729.70 → 1731.66] Because it's happened multiple times.
[1731.66 → 1735.90] He lost the first phone that he ever earned as an influencer.
[1736.12 → 1739.44] And I'm going to use the word earned because you don't become an influencer by accident.
[1739.76 → 1740.72] He left it on a plane.
[1742.50 → 1744.66] It was an LG G3?
[1744.78 → 1745.22] G3.
[1745.34 → 1745.80] G3.
[1745.80 → 1747.54] That still haunts me to this day.
[1747.56 → 1747.86] You dork.
[1748.02 → 1753.00] So, stop carrying pointless items around in your pockets, like receipts, old hotel room
[1753.00 → 1754.10] keys, or spent gift cards.
[1754.38 → 1758.00] The Ridge Wallet is designed to help you carry less.
[1758.36 → 1763.68] It uses two metal plates that are bound by a strong elastic band, keeping all your cards
[1763.68 → 1766.02] tightly together, but still easily accessible.
[1766.48 → 1769.42] It's RFID blocking, and it's lifetime guaranteed.
[1769.42 → 1773.60] It comes in different types of metal, like aluminum, titanium, and carbon fibre, which is
[1773.60 → 1774.74] not a type of metal, but chill.
[1774.74 → 1781.56] And you can use offer code LTT to save 10% on a Ridge Wallet at ridgewallet.com slash LTT.
[1781.74 → 1782.96] Oh, you want to hit me with a carbon fibre?
[1783.86 → 1784.08] Woo!
[1784.98 → 1785.68] It's lighter.
[1787.04 → 1788.48] Go freaking figure!
[1788.60 → 1789.84] Who would have thunk such a thing?
[1790.06 → 1790.40] Wow.
[1791.08 → 1794.56] Also up for today's show is Savage Le Jerky.
[1794.68 → 1796.02] Where's my maple buffalo bacon?
[1796.14 → 1799.26] You can pick between these two, and I am salivating already.
[1799.74 → 1799.92] Oh.
[1800.46 → 1804.72] Savage Jerky was made by a group of friends that were tired of the same mediocre...
[1804.72 → 1805.28] Jerky.
[1805.42 → 1805.54] Yeah.
[1805.54 → 1809.42] They wanted a snack that was flavourful, spicy, and something that you wouldn't regret eating
[1809.42 → 1809.70] later.
[1809.80 → 1815.00] They've got 13 different flavours of jerky, like Moho, ghost pepper buffalo, and my favourite,
[1816.18 → 1817.36] maple buffalo bacon.
[1817.36 → 1818.36] You might regret...
[1818.36 → 1819.36] You might regret...
[1819.36 → 1821.36] You might regret...
[1821.36 → 1826.44] You might regret, you know, ghost pepper buffalo a little bit, partially.
[1826.84 → 1827.86] You won't regret the flavour.
[1828.36 → 1829.74] You might regret what it does to you.
[1831.10 → 1832.80] You might regret what it does to your toilet.
[1833.02 → 1833.24] Yeah.
[1833.24 → 1836.46] But hey, it's yummy.
[1836.72 → 1836.92] Uh-huh.
[1838.20 → 1839.60] And they don't just sell jerky.
[1839.86 → 1841.16] You can try out their hot sauces.
[1841.72 → 1845.22] I haven't tried the Moho habanero one that I'm holding up right now, but the ghost pepper
[1845.22 → 1846.02] one is...
[1846.02 → 1847.04] Or the Carolina Reaper one.
[1847.08 → 1847.70] That's the one I have.
[1847.76 → 1848.90] It's so good.
[1849.06 → 1849.54] I really...
[1849.54 → 1853.16] I haven't tried this sauce, but I really like this jerky, so it's probably good.
[1854.02 → 1859.70] They've also got their barbecue sauces, and they've even got a spice rub that goes great
[1859.70 → 1860.24] on anything.
[1861.16 → 1862.42] They've got a promo on right now.
[1862.52 → 1864.40] Buy three bags of jerky and get one free.
[1864.62 → 1865.08] Heck yeah.
[1865.74 → 1869.48] So check it out at leg.GG slash savage jerky.
[1870.22 → 1871.16] Finally, we've got disc plate.
[1872.12 → 1872.48] Boom.
[1872.68 → 1874.38] How do you like that LTX disc plate?
[1874.66 → 1874.88] Yeah.
[1874.98 → 1875.54] Pull it off.
[1875.58 → 1876.02] Pull it off.
[1877.28 → 1879.10] That's how easy it is to mount a disc plate.
[1879.20 → 1880.84] Make your walls look awesome with disc plate.
[1880.92 → 1881.94] The posters are made out of metal.
[1882.04 → 1882.96] They're three millimetres thick.
[1882.96 → 1884.92] They've got bent edges so that you won't cut yourself.
[1885.30 → 1890.38] They use a magnetic wall mounting system, and they've got 15,000 artists who have contributed
[1890.38 → 1893.04] to over 260,000 different designs.
[1893.48 → 1895.64] Each disc plate sold gets 10 trees planted.
[1895.90 → 1897.20] They offer hassle-free returns.
[1897.34 → 1902.16] They're already gift packed, and with the code LTT, you can save 15%.
[1902.16 → 1905.32] So just head to leg.GG slash disc plate when.
[1905.70 → 1907.06] Those are available for sale, too.
[1907.10 → 1908.80] Oh, and apparently these are for sale.
[1909.60 → 1910.84] Honestly, these are really sharp.
[1910.94 → 1911.38] That's cool.
[1911.38 → 1912.38] These are like...
[1912.38 → 1913.38] Yeah.
[1913.38 → 1914.98] These are pretty cool.
[1915.14 → 1917.60] You know how people used to get those metal car signs in their garage?
[1918.64 → 1921.10] Metal tech signs in your computer room.
[1921.74 → 1921.88] Right?
[1921.88 → 1922.90] Or where you have your computer.
[1923.90 → 1924.22] Perfect.
[1924.52 → 1925.02] That's cool.
[1925.32 → 1925.56] Yeah.
[1925.56 → 1928.78] This one made me like a tiny bit sad.
[1929.10 → 1929.98] Because you're not on it.
[1930.06 → 1930.24] Yeah.
[1930.64 → 1930.96] Mm-hmm.
[1931.10 → 1931.64] I checked.
[1932.02 → 1932.26] Yeah.
[1932.38 → 1932.96] I was curious.
[1936.96 → 1937.60] All right.
[1937.66 → 1938.76] Back to the show, ladies and gentlemen.
[1939.46 → 1940.56] Why don't we talk about...
[1940.56 → 1941.22] Do a tech topic?
[1941.64 → 1942.02] Yeah.
[1942.06 → 1943.88] Why don't we talk about the 64 core Thread ripper?
[1944.08 → 1944.38] Yes.
[1944.38 → 1946.40] So this is a rumour right now.
[1946.56 → 1947.26] Rumour status.
[1947.46 → 1949.44] This was posted by Clueless Gamer on the forum.
[1950.96 → 1952.30] It's definitely a rumour.
[1952.66 → 1953.42] WCCF tech.
[1954.20 → 1962.28] They claim AMD is working on a 64 core, 128 thread Thread ripper part for launch in Q4 of
[1962.28 → 1963.10] 2019.
[1964.10 → 1970.04] Now, this was something that was very recently rumoured to be going away altogether.
[1970.22 → 1972.26] Thread ripper was like on AMD's roadmap.
[1973.02 → 1973.40] And then it was like...
[1973.40 → 1974.18] And then kind of off.
[1974.26 → 1974.94] Not on it.
[1974.96 → 1975.14] Yeah.
[1975.72 → 1978.44] And then now there's a rumour that we're still going to have it.
[1979.18 → 1980.56] I'm going to say something unpopular.
[1980.96 → 1981.22] Ooh.
[1981.68 → 1983.44] I don't think this skew makes any sense.
[1984.52 → 1984.72] Hmm.
[1985.18 → 1989.18] I think AMD has such a strong end.
[1989.18 → 1990.72] And I am...
[1990.72 → 1993.48] Take everything I'm saying as a rumour.
[1994.64 → 2000.02] And the reason for that is that we haven't actually seen third gen Ry zen performance yet.
[2000.26 → 2000.48] Yeah.
[2000.84 → 2001.60] So I am...
[2001.60 → 2002.66] Oh, we're coming back to this.
[2002.82 → 2009.50] I am assuming based on AMD's numbers that they have provided that they are not lying.
[2009.82 → 2010.24] Yeah.
[2010.36 → 2013.14] And that third gen Ryder kicks ass.
[2013.28 → 2013.60] Ryder.
[2014.26 → 2015.04] Did I say Ryder?
[2015.12 → 2015.60] Ryder.
[2015.74 → 2016.06] Ry zen.
[2016.22 → 2016.42] Sorry.
[2016.42 → 2017.32] All right.
[2017.32 → 2022.02] So I am assuming that they are not bull crapping around.
[2022.66 → 2023.78] I kind of like Ryder.
[2024.28 → 2024.36] Right.
[2024.66 → 2026.14] Someone should make a Ryder product line.
[2026.94 → 2027.24] All right.
[2027.32 → 2027.62] Enough.
[2028.52 → 2028.96] Sorry.
[2029.76 → 2030.20] Here.
[2030.44 → 2031.50] Just twist a little.
[2031.70 → 2031.98] Go ahead.
[2032.46 → 2032.88] Take it.
[2033.60 → 2033.86] Oh.
[2034.12 → 2034.58] Thanks.
[2034.72 → 2034.88] Yeah.
[2035.18 → 2036.50] Looked like a nipple pinch or something.
[2036.82 → 2037.10] Anyway.
[2037.52 → 2037.96] Maybe it was.
[2038.08 → 2041.00] So I'm going based on that third gen Ry zen is going to be awesome.
[2041.00 → 2045.82] So here's my counter to Thread ripper pitch.
[2045.90 → 2049.72] You already have 32 core Thread ripper.
[2050.32 → 2050.60] Okay.
[2050.64 → 2051.88] That already exists.
[2052.22 → 2063.36] On the Ry zen third gen mainstream platform, you are already going to have a 16 core 32 thread chip.
[2063.36 → 2072.34] I would postulate that for the vast majority of workloads, that is already more than enough.
[2074.96 → 2076.96] And I realize I'm changing my tune a lot.
[2077.18 → 2085.20] Because back when Intel was determined to keep quad-core the maximum for mainstream forever, I was like, yo, where's my cores?
[2085.20 → 2087.92] For mainstream, I absolutely think so.
[2088.04 → 2093.26] For some scenarios where you're trying to build out like serverless clouds and stuff.
[2093.40 → 2093.84] By Epic.
[2095.04 → 2095.48] Yeah.
[2096.92 → 2101.02] I just, it feels completely unnecessary.
[2102.20 → 2106.20] Because Ry zen, whatever it is, 30, 90 something, 30 something 90X.
[2106.20 → 2107.38] What's the future of their Epic?
[2108.22 → 2110.26] What's the future of the Epic processor?
[2111.16 → 2111.68] 30 what?
[2111.68 → 2116.68] No, Epic is, Epic is going to be on their, so Zen 2 Epic is going to be called Brome.
[2117.26 → 2117.72] Oh, okay.
[2117.72 → 2118.06] It's coming.
[2118.28 → 2118.52] Okay.
[2118.60 → 2118.98] Very soon.
[2119.10 → 2119.38] Okay, okay.
[2119.78 → 2132.86] So, I could still see them doing Thread ripper as a 20, 24, 32 lineup or something like that.
[2133.36 → 2134.70] But that's three SKUs.
[2135.42 → 2140.84] It's hard to say if it's worth maintaining a completely separate socket and chipset platform for it.
[2141.68 → 2147.88] Um, because it's already like, it's, like it's, it's so niche.
[2148.18 → 2153.74] The only reason I could think of to do it would be to just put the screws to Intel.
[2154.60 → 2156.92] But even then, it's totally unnecessary.
[2157.14 → 2157.52] Like we already.
[2157.52 → 2158.30] I think they already kind of have.
[2158.76 → 2166.68] Intel isn't going to have anything to compete with even a 32 core Thread ripper within the next 18 months as far as I can tell.
[2166.68 → 2167.04] Yeah.
[2167.40 → 2175.58] So, this is just, when do we get to the point where we're honestly just giving up too much of our single threaded clock speed for the sake of having more cores?
[2175.98 → 2180.40] And if we really need 64 cores, why aren't we just getting an Epic?
[2180.50 → 2184.36] There is very, very little that I can think of.
[2184.36 → 2188.90] Even for a workstation workload that needs 64 CPU cores.
[2189.06 → 2190.38] I hadn't heard the Rome.
[2190.52 → 2191.14] You call that Rome?
[2191.40 → 2191.58] Rome.
[2191.58 → 2192.34] Like R-O-M-E?
[2192.54 → 2192.72] Yeah.
[2192.92 → 2193.12] Yeah.
[2193.12 → 2193.30] Okay.
[2193.32 → 2194.76] I hadn't heard the Rome news.
[2195.14 → 2197.50] So, it sort of made sense to me.
[2197.66 → 2199.44] Is there specs out for what Rome will be?
[2200.18 → 2201.16] Up to 64 cores.
[2201.26 → 2202.90] So, basically, they're just repurposing Rome.
[2202.94 → 2203.20] Yeah.
[2203.36 → 2204.54] As a workstation product.
[2204.72 → 2207.76] Which, I mean, I guess if you're building the damn thing anyway.
[2208.64 → 2208.96] Okay.
[2208.96 → 2210.08] Maybe if it's easy.
[2212.56 → 2213.82] Doesn't make a yeah.
[2213.92 → 2215.74] The thing about Thread ripper, though, is it's overclockable.
[2216.54 → 2219.98] I don't know that I would recommend overclocking a 64 core processor.
[2221.82 → 2224.94] So, it just feels like the product without a customer.
[2227.22 → 2232.76] Because you're either a little bit lower than it, probably, or a little bit higher than it, probably.
[2233.38 → 2235.20] It's fairly unlikely you'll be right on.
[2235.30 → 2238.12] So, if I'm AMD and there's any truth to...
[2238.12 → 2239.06] It would be fun.
[2239.26 → 2239.92] The rumour's here.
[2239.98 → 2240.14] Yeah.
[2240.74 → 2241.38] So, okay.
[2242.24 → 2244.74] If this isn't about building a practical product.
[2244.84 → 2245.06] Yeah.
[2245.14 → 2246.90] And you don't actually care if anybody buys it.
[2247.12 → 2247.26] Yeah.
[2247.26 → 2248.08] Here's what's going to happen.
[2248.68 → 2254.64] Based on what we know what we're taking AMD's word for, so far, with third-gen Ry zen,
[2255.24 → 2257.08] it should have excellent performance per watt.
[2257.54 → 2263.96] The sustained clock speeds that it can hit should be pretty decent, even with high core counts.
[2263.96 → 2269.58] And its IPC improvements over last-gen Zen are looking pretty good.
[2269.68 → 2269.86] Yeah.
[2269.86 → 2277.86] So, with all of that in mind, Intel's highest end, and it's like full desperation move, that
[2277.86 → 2282.94] W-series 28 core Leon, the overclockable one that you can put on.
[2283.02 → 2285.44] There's like three motherboards that exist for it or whatever.
[2285.44 → 2285.80] Sure.
[2286.62 → 2293.86] So, Intel's best possible response, without bringing back like skull trail dual socket
[2293.86 → 2296.54] overclockable systems, is 28 cores.
[2296.54 → 2296.60] Which were cool.
[2296.60 → 2304.74] So, what we know then, is that if AMD goes 32 core, which is what they currently have, and
[2304.74 → 2309.40] what they could easily and comfortably do with a next-gen Thread ripper, they will probably
[2309.40 → 2310.88] beat that processor by a little.
[2311.40 → 2317.76] So, when you're looking at the review, the Halo product versus the Halo product, AMD might
[2317.76 → 2321.32] be on top, but by a bit.
[2321.32 → 2325.72] And it might depend on if it's like an AVX 512 enabled workload or whatever.
[2326.30 → 2334.48] If AMD releases a 64 core processor, they know that for the first time ever.
[2335.22 → 2335.90] No, no.
[2336.26 → 2337.38] They beat Intel to dual-core.
[2337.78 → 2338.60] They beat them to dual-core.
[2338.92 → 2345.36] So, for the first time in over 10 years, they know that they will not just beat Intel at
[2345.36 → 2351.54] the top of the benchmark leaderboards, they will absolutely fucking destroy them.
[2351.84 → 2352.88] Pardon my French.
[2353.24 → 2353.54] Sorry.
[2353.64 → 2354.40] We don't have the button.
[2354.80 → 2355.68] Yeah, I need the button.
[2355.76 → 2356.14] Ugh!
[2356.62 → 2361.96] Like, we're talking, there will be benchmark graphs where people are showing, you know,
[2362.14 → 2369.58] video encoding in FFmpeg or Cine bench where AMD literally is outperforming Intel by a factor
[2369.58 → 2370.40] of two.
[2370.64 → 2370.90] Yeah.
[2370.90 → 2375.34] That's the only reason that I can think of for them to do it.
[2375.48 → 2376.36] It sounds fun.
[2376.56 → 2382.34] And with how, like, successful they've been for the last little while, maybe that type
[2382.34 → 2384.20] of fun is becoming worth it.
[2384.84 → 2390.32] Where, like, the last round of processors from AMD, I would not have necessarily said the
[2390.32 → 2390.66] same thing.
[2390.68 → 2394.02] Well, now that they're selling anything at a profit, they actually have some money to
[2394.02 → 2394.46] play with.
[2394.56 → 2395.08] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2395.08 → 2395.84] So, that helps.
[2395.98 → 2396.16] Yeah.
[2399.40 → 2400.14] It's cool, though.
[2400.24 → 2400.70] I don't know.
[2400.70 → 2402.88] I've been very happy with all this AMD stuff.
[2403.56 → 2410.86] And with constant security vulnerability problems coming from Intel, it's a good time over in
[2410.86 → 2411.28] that camp.
[2411.60 → 2419.48] So, the rumour is that it would be socket compatible with existing TR4 motherboards after a BIOS
[2419.48 → 2419.84] update.
[2421.36 → 2424.70] There's speculation that it's probably a 14 nanometre part.
[2424.70 → 2430.18] We're expecting it to be priced in the $2,500 to $3,000 range.
[2432.84 → 2438.32] And they're aiming for mid-Q4 2019 because they have something planned for CES next year,
[2438.52 → 2440.36] or at the very latest January 2020.
[2440.36 → 2446.02] Actually, I don't even know if these are Zen 2 cores, which is interesting, because if they're
[2446.02 → 2449.06] not 7 nanometers, they wouldn't be, as far as I know.
[2449.66 → 2453.22] Forgive me for not having all the details about this rumoured product.
[2453.22 → 2453.30] Rumoured.
[2453.38 → 2453.54] Yeah.
[2453.54 → 2455.60] But we'll see how it goes.
[2456.12 → 2463.30] Either way, the only way that I could see this making any sense for AMD is just as a gigantic
[2463.30 → 2464.08] F you.
[2465.04 → 2466.04] Which is fun!
[2466.78 → 2467.52] Which is fun.
[2467.66 → 2467.86] Yeah.
[2468.54 → 2468.78] Yeah.
[2468.78 → 2470.52] All right.
[2470.70 → 2473.06] Speaking of fun, Xbox Scarlet announced.
[2473.22 → 2473.96] You want to talk about this one?
[2474.52 → 2474.98] Yeah.
[2475.18 → 2475.46] Sure.
[2475.64 → 2477.28] This is awesome, by the way.
[2477.70 → 2480.22] And if you're in the computer space, you're like, no, consoles suck.
[2480.50 → 2481.70] No, it's awesome.
[2482.02 → 2482.48] Shut up.
[2482.48 → 2487.08] Because every time new, really awesome consoles come out, everything steps up a little bit.
[2487.18 → 2491.04] Because developers are going to be making for compatibility across the platform, and you
[2491.04 → 2491.52] want this.
[2491.58 → 2492.36] This is good for you.
[2492.44 → 2493.46] This is very good for you.
[2493.58 → 2495.76] Also, consoles are basically computers now.
[2495.82 → 2496.20] Yes.
[2496.68 → 2497.62] Extremely much so.
[2497.62 → 2498.96] So ports don't suck so hard.
[2499.08 → 2499.36] Yeah.
[2501.22 → 2501.90] It's great.
[2502.10 → 2503.48] It's actually, it's fantastic.
[2503.62 → 2505.92] Anyway, Microsoft announced it at E3 2019.
[2506.12 → 2508.02] There's a bunch of stuff that got announced at E3 2019.
[2510.36 → 2514.72] Apparently, we'll have a physical disk drive, which is actually important to know, because
[2514.72 → 2517.32] they've been talking about maybe not having that for a little while now.
[2517.50 → 2518.58] Can I interrupt real for a sec here?
[2519.04 → 2520.30] This is a really important comment.
[2520.42 → 2522.88] Clash in Cube India says, Linus got a great body.
[2523.32 → 2523.78] Thank you.
[2524.00 → 2524.28] Damn.
[2524.34 → 2524.60] Go ahead.
[2525.42 → 2526.14] I did.
[2526.40 → 2526.90] I did.
[2527.62 → 2533.24] Auto-completes for you and I on YouTube recently, just out of pure curiosity.
[2533.46 → 2533.60] Yeah.
[2533.68 → 2535.28] And one of your top ones is topless.
[2536.90 → 2537.34] Really?
[2537.48 → 2538.50] Or shirtless or something.
[2538.60 → 2540.14] But effectively, without a shirt on.
[2540.20 → 2540.70] That's uncomfortable.
[2540.80 → 2541.58] So there you go.
[2541.76 → 2541.94] Cool.
[2542.24 → 2544.32] Nobody should want to see my weird chest hair tuft.
[2544.32 → 2551.88] It's a custom designed AMD processor using Zen 2 and Nazi architectures.
[2551.98 → 2552.46] Sexy.
[2552.54 → 2556.02] From a pure processing perspective, it's four times more powerful.
[2556.42 → 2560.84] And while I was reading this, I expected it to say the original Xbox One.
[2561.10 → 2564.60] But it's the Xbox One X, which is, that's actually like, that's cool.
[2564.60 → 2568.12] So capable of running games at 120 hertz frame rates.
[2568.22 → 2573.14] Now, I want to jump in for a second and say that that is a BS way to talk about the power
[2573.14 → 2574.00] of a game console.
[2574.96 → 2575.58] That's true.
[2575.72 → 2575.90] Sure.
[2575.90 → 2576.84] What game are we talking about?
[2577.78 → 2580.16] At what texture resolution?
[2581.02 → 2582.12] At what detail level?
[2582.22 → 2583.28] At what draw distance?
[2583.28 → 2585.52] And this is going to apply to the next note as well.
[2586.10 → 2588.88] Keynote says 8K compatibility for a brief second.
[2589.06 → 2589.70] Like, yeah.
[2590.02 → 2590.68] Is it a picture?
[2591.04 → 2593.38] This stuff makes me so mad.
[2593.98 → 2598.20] So there were people posting, again, on the personal rig update one, that were like,
[2599.42 → 2604.36] PC gaming is a joke because even with the Titan RTX, it was still only running at 70 to 85 frames
[2604.36 → 2604.80] per second.
[2607.32 → 2609.20] As if it's that simple.
[2610.22 → 2612.54] It depends on how much you cranked up the details.
[2612.54 → 2616.28] Do you remember the console comparison video we did?
[2616.66 → 2616.88] Yeah.
[2617.00 → 2618.18] At the last big launch?
[2618.68 → 2620.92] That was technically like the last big console launch.
[2621.44 → 2622.56] It's just been forever.
[2622.80 → 2623.62] You guys should do another one.
[2624.74 → 2625.52] Yeah, we totally should.
[2626.30 → 2627.56] I was also thinking of doing a video.
[2627.56 → 2628.02] A lot better.
[2628.94 → 2632.60] Doing a video called, console marketing is stupid.
[2634.50 → 2636.46] Okay, but PC marketing is really stupid too.
[2636.82 → 2638.02] I know, but console marketing.
[2638.22 → 2638.86] VR ready.
[2640.02 → 2640.82] SLI ready.
[2640.82 → 2643.44] That's really stupid, and I don't have to accept that.
[2644.04 → 2651.68] So the reason that marketing a console as 4K is that everything has trade-offs.
[2652.16 → 2655.84] I could run games at 4K on a six-year-old computer.
[2656.56 → 2657.66] What games?
[2659.02 → 2660.84] At what image quality settings?
[2661.06 → 2661.52] Pong.
[2661.52 → 2662.78] Exactly.
[2662.78 → 2666.86] I could run, I could, I could, whatever, this laptop.
[2667.36 → 2670.54] I could run a game at 4K, 120 frames per second.
[2670.90 → 2676.82] If I don't tell you what game it is and what it freaking looks like, that is not meaningful
[2676.82 → 2677.46] information.
[2677.46 → 2684.84] It's like, it's like having a multi-variable algebra equation, and you've only got one number
[2684.84 → 2686.92] and everything else.
[2687.24 → 2693.40] You've got variables X, Y, Z, A, B, C, gamma, freaking, it's all over the place.
[2693.40 → 2696.66] It would be cool if they tried to maybe use a first-party title.
[2697.76 → 2700.06] Like for Microsoft, pretty easy one to call out, Halo.
[2700.06 → 2704.92] Halo, if they were like, Halo and more, we'll run at 120.
[2705.30 → 2705.56] Sure.
[2705.72 → 2706.18] Or something.
[2707.62 → 2708.64] Anyway, I'll let you finish.
[2708.76 → 2710.66] I'm going to let you finish, but I'm going to let you finish.
[2711.78 → 2715.62] Apparently there's a quote saying, we're seeing over 40 times performance increase over the
[2715.62 → 2716.40] current generation.
[2716.66 → 2717.42] From the SSD.
[2718.20 → 2721.52] And yeah, yeah, yeah, to be, yeah, I probably should have said that.
[2722.06 → 2725.86] Because the SSD is being used as virtual RAM, so it's going to share a little bit.
[2726.22 → 2726.70] That's pretty cool.
[2726.70 → 2732.30] Moving through worlds without waiting for screens to load is going to maybe sometimes happen
[2732.30 → 2733.12] with some games.
[2733.72 → 2738.58] That's so funny too, because it's like, they're like, yeah, what an innovation, an SSD.
[2739.36 → 2739.64] Yeah.
[2739.78 → 2740.64] Meanwhile, we're like.
[2741.12 → 2741.56] Hey.
[2742.02 → 2748.36] Yeah, you mean like when people were upgrading for freaking like, wow, burning crusade.
[2749.96 → 2753.60] And to be clear, people have been manually upgrading consoles with SSDs for a bit too.
[2754.56 → 2756.20] Honestly, like burning crusade days.
[2756.20 → 2760.10] That was kind of when people started upgrading and putting wow on an SSD so that they wouldn't
[2760.10 → 2761.12] load when they went.
[2761.26 → 2762.46] Like, come on.
[2765.30 → 2769.56] Halo Infinite is confirmed as a launch title, but also to be clear, Halo Infinite is coming
[2769.56 → 2772.02] to PC and Xbox One X as well.
[2772.08 → 2772.40] Nice.
[2775.68 → 2779.16] It's possible that a new Elite controller, a Series 2.
[2779.26 → 2780.30] No, that's available for period.
[2780.42 → 2780.84] That's coming.
[2781.64 → 2782.36] I'm excited.
[2782.36 → 2784.08] I love my Elite controller.
[2784.74 → 2785.62] Except when it broke.
[2786.12 → 2789.62] It's actually the only Xbox controller I've ever had break is my Elite controller.
[2789.88 → 2790.76] That's kind of sad.
[2791.20 → 2791.86] How did it break?
[2791.96 → 2792.22] D-pad.
[2793.26 → 2797.14] So I was playing Cross Code and used the D-pad to switch between the different elements.
[2797.26 → 2797.42] Okay.
[2797.46 → 2798.30] I'm starting soon.
[2798.84 → 2799.94] You said something about, sorry.
[2799.94 → 2803.06] You said something about keyboard and mouse versus controller.
[2803.20 → 2803.98] Should I keyboard and mouse it?
[2806.30 → 2807.72] It's, I think it, okay.
[2807.82 → 2809.98] I've never actually played it on keyboard and mouse.
[2809.98 → 2816.28] So the only experience I have with the keyboard and mouse controls, I didn't even realize you
[2816.28 → 2820.68] could play it with keyboard and mouse because it's like a top-down sprite-based RPG and
[2820.68 → 2824.36] I just grabbed a controller the first time I played it because I was like, duh, this is
[2824.36 → 2824.42] a controller game.
[2824.42 → 2825.46] That's usually how you do that.
[2825.58 → 2825.70] Yeah.
[2825.70 → 2830.54] So the only reason I even know you can control it with keyboard and mouse is because I was
[2830.54 → 2835.86] sitting on a plane and I kept like accidentally like aiming and firing at stuff and I didn't
[2835.86 → 2837.90] realize I was touching my touchpad with the back of my hand.
[2838.78 → 2843.54] So I kind of played around with it a little bit, and it seems like particularly for quickly
[2843.54 → 2847.00] aiming, keyboard and mouse would be way better.
[2847.30 → 2847.48] Yeah.
[2847.68 → 2848.26] That makes sense.
[2848.36 → 2849.08] That's kind of a rule.
[2849.08 → 2857.92] I really enjoyed like the laid back console experience of using a controller with it and
[2857.92 → 2861.22] like you're good enough with a controller that it probably shouldn't matter.
[2861.46 → 2861.66] Okay.
[2861.76 → 2861.98] Yeah.
[2862.56 → 2863.48] Like I could do it.
[2863.56 → 2864.08] I beat the game.
[2864.14 → 2864.66] No problem.
[2865.60 → 2871.08] There were challenging parts, but like I could do it, and it wasn't so, did you ever play Psychopath?
[2871.52 → 2873.44] No, I played a demo.
[2874.00 → 2874.16] Okay.
[2874.16 → 2874.44] Okay.
[2874.44 → 2881.16] So Psychopath towards the end is like, it's like kind of unfair.
[2882.12 → 2888.34] Like there's some really frustrating parts that are like, I'd say amazing game design
[2888.34 → 2889.98] for a very skilled player.
[2890.94 → 2897.38] Like you should be able to, you should be able to beat it on the first try if you're really,
[2897.52 → 2899.74] perfect, unless it's Dark Souls or something.
[2899.88 → 2903.78] Like obviously there are games that are designed to just kick your ass over and over and over
[2903.78 → 2904.06] again.
[2904.06 → 2904.34] Yeah.
[2905.40 → 2909.34] But I'd say most games, if they're balanced correctly, if you're really, perfect and
[2909.34 → 2913.42] you are mastering every new skill as it comes at you, you should be able to beat a level
[2913.42 → 2914.12] on the first try.
[2914.26 → 2915.76] Like Psychopath, like really, really tough.
[2915.82 → 2920.14] So I'd say cross code is, is everything is beatable on the first try.
[2920.20 → 2924.62] If you've been paying really close attention with a controller, there's, I never felt like
[2924.62 → 2925.62] it was totally unfair.
[2925.62 → 2925.98] Fair.
[2925.98 → 2926.02] Okay.
[2926.60 → 2926.88] Yeah.
[2927.08 → 2927.40] All right.
[2927.54 → 2927.74] Fair.
[2929.18 → 2932.90] Current Xbox One accessories will work with Scarlet, which is cool.
[2933.04 → 2934.98] And apparently launching holiday 2020.
[2935.52 → 2938.46] So we're still quite a ways out.
[2939.58 → 2940.64] But yeah.
[2940.64 → 2942.58] Yes, Jim, this is bacon turkey.
[2944.14 → 2945.48] It's pretty legit, actually.
[2947.14 → 2947.96] But yeah, that's Scarlet.
[2948.36 → 2951.00] It's not coming for a while, but it's very exciting.
[2951.52 → 2951.96] It's cool.
[2951.96 → 2959.50] We should maybe stay on the Microsoft path and jump down to the Xbox Game Pass for PC.
[2960.94 → 2961.50] Yeah.
[2962.62 → 2969.12] So basically, it's like a Steam-like thingy, but it's subscription-based.
[2969.56 → 2976.30] It's $10 a month or $5 a month if you sign up during the beta or $1 if you sign up now,
[2976.48 → 2977.70] but it's $10 a month.
[2977.70 → 2984.30] So over 100 PC games available at launch, and it's not game streaming, so you still need
[2984.30 → 2986.48] to download the game and play it off your computer and stuff.
[2986.60 → 2987.80] So here are some of the games.
[2988.80 → 2989.08] Here.
[2989.40 → 2990.98] I'll just screen share with you guys.
[2992.34 → 2993.26] Ba-door-doop-doop.
[2994.18 → 2995.12] 333 results.
[2995.90 → 2998.48] Honestly, as with pretty much all of these things.
[2998.86 → 3001.54] So here, let's filter by PC games.
[3001.92 → 3002.36] Sure.
[3004.14 → 3004.58] Hooray.
[3005.94 → 3006.88] 108 results.
[3006.88 → 3007.76] That's more like it.
[3008.58 → 3008.78] Yeah.
[3008.94 → 3009.80] Door-doop-doop-doop.
[3010.24 → 3012.70] A lot of it is stuff I have never heard of.
[3013.50 → 3013.94] Sforza!
[3014.70 → 3015.52] Sea of Thieves.
[3015.56 → 3016.18] Years of War!
[3016.28 → 3016.82] Years of War.
[3017.28 → 3018.44] Bunch of first-party stuff.
[3018.78 → 3022.40] I think the most interesting things in here are going to be the first-party games.
[3022.58 → 3025.98] Other than that, they're going to be mostly things that could have been very cheap if you
[3025.98 → 3030.16] bought them on certain sales, or things that you're probably not going to be super interested
[3030.16 → 3036.38] in just because unless you're equally interested in literally every game genre, because there's
[3036.38 → 3037.54] a bunch of different game genres.
[3038.84 → 3040.24] Maybe this is a perfect game.
[3040.32 → 3043.80] Is it wrong if I'm a little offended by someone trying to capitalize on Mr. Rogers?
[3043.80 → 3046.00] He was so against that kind of stuff.
[3046.50 → 3047.40] Is that supposed to be...
[3047.40 → 3048.02] Hello Neighbour?
[3048.38 → 3048.84] Come on.
[3049.28 → 3051.22] Wearing like a plaid sweater vest.
[3051.32 → 3052.84] Oh, it's a super creepy game though.
[3052.92 → 3054.68] It has nothing to do with...
[3054.68 → 3055.64] I hear ya.
[3056.30 → 3057.34] I see where you're going.
[3057.46 → 3059.34] You can't say Hello Neighbour without it...
[3059.34 → 3059.74] Yeah.
[3059.98 → 3060.96] ...being Fred Rogers.
[3061.00 → 3061.56] I got you.
[3061.72 → 3062.70] But you're trying to like...
[3062.70 → 3065.40] I've never played it, but I think you're trying to like break into that guy's house,
[3065.66 → 3067.20] and he's trying to like to catch you.
[3067.20 → 3068.12] Hmm.
[3068.82 → 3069.20] And then...
[3069.98 → 3070.22] Yeah.
[3070.38 → 3072.68] I think he's holding a shovel because he attacks you or something.
[3072.80 → 3073.18] I don't have to know.
[3073.18 → 3073.84] Highly recommended.
[3074.00 → 3074.76] Bro force is amazing.
[3075.06 → 3077.00] Luke and I played through it a little while ago.
[3077.70 → 3078.56] Slay the Spire is great.
[3080.46 → 3081.10] Very good.
[3081.92 → 3083.94] I actually really enjoyed Lucky's Tale.
[3084.50 → 3084.90] Really?
[3085.12 → 3085.44] Yeah.
[3085.60 → 3086.14] Did you not?
[3086.64 → 3088.50] I don't think I played it very much.
[3088.60 → 3088.84] Oh.
[3089.20 → 3089.42] Yeah.
[3089.42 → 3090.10] It was like...
[3090.10 → 3092.80] It's like the one thing that I ever played on the Oculus.
[3093.02 → 3093.18] Yeah.
[3093.30 → 3093.98] Except I didn't.
[3094.10 → 3095.00] I ran it on the Five.
[3095.00 → 3098.84] But I had bought an Oculus, so I don't even care.
[3099.08 → 3099.34] Yeah.
[3099.78 → 3100.34] So...
[3100.34 → 3102.10] Because I bought one for LMG.
[3102.24 → 3102.46] Yeah.
[3102.72 → 3108.28] So I ran that on an unauthorized system with no qualms.
[3108.28 → 3108.92] It's interesting.
[3109.06 → 3113.60] So we called this so hard, and we got so much crap for it.
[3113.72 → 3114.52] Mostly me, I guess.
[3115.04 → 3116.18] Not the crap.
[3116.26 → 3116.86] I mean the calling.
[3117.16 → 3117.42] Yeah, yeah.
[3117.72 → 3118.68] But VR.
[3118.98 → 3120.34] You guys didn't even cover the new stuff.
[3121.24 → 3122.24] Did anyone complain?
[3122.66 → 3123.62] Yes, actually.
[3123.62 → 3125.02] I need to cover the quest.
[3125.16 → 3125.94] People are mad.
[3126.16 → 3127.08] But not the Rift S.
[3127.66 → 3128.90] Who cares about the Rift S?
[3129.44 → 3129.72] Yeah.
[3130.22 → 3130.70] There you go.
[3130.90 → 3131.24] Oof.
[3131.60 → 3132.82] Yeah, no one cared about the Rift S.
[3132.88 → 3134.42] People do care about the quest.
[3134.72 → 3136.00] The quest seems to be doing pretty well.
[3136.02 → 3140.18] I'm really skeptical about it, but I am trying to maintain an open mind.
[3140.18 → 3141.04] I will...
[3141.04 → 3143.18] I was going to come here and say...
[3143.18 → 3143.76] I will review the quest.
[3143.76 → 3146.54] ...and say, I understand, but I think you should cover it.
[3146.54 → 3151.68] Because I don't think Linus Tech Tips should lose the foothold of covering VR content.
[3151.80 → 3151.90] No.
[3151.96 → 3154.12] Because I think it will be huge at some time.
[3154.46 → 3155.00] At some point.
[3155.28 → 3155.60] Oh, hey.
[3155.60 → 3155.92] In time.
[3156.46 → 3157.52] Cross codes in Game Pass.
[3158.02 → 3158.28] Hey.
[3158.72 → 3159.02] Hey.
[3159.18 → 3160.08] Already bought it, so whatever.
[3160.70 → 3161.26] That's cheap.
[3161.50 → 3161.70] Yeah.
[3162.64 → 3163.84] I love that game so much.
[3164.50 → 3165.10] I wouldn't...
[3165.10 → 3166.84] It's not like...
[3166.84 → 3167.02] Oh, man.
[3167.02 → 3167.62] Are you going to play it again?
[3167.64 → 3168.08] It's hard.
[3168.54 → 3169.68] Not necessarily recommend it?
[3169.74 → 3170.24] It's not...
[3170.24 → 3170.50] Oh, no.
[3170.52 → 3171.18] I'll recommend it.
[3171.34 → 3171.60] Okay.
[3171.70 → 3172.06] No problem.
[3172.26 → 3177.80] It's not my favourite game or anything, but if I'm being really honest, I think it's
[3177.80 → 3183.26] better than a lot of the RPGs that I treasure having played as a kid.
[3183.48 → 3183.78] Oh.
[3183.90 → 3185.24] Like, I think it's objectively better.
[3185.24 → 3186.92] They've got some nostalgia glasses going on?
[3187.04 → 3187.44] Yeah.
[3187.66 → 3190.20] Like, I think if I'm being honest with myself...
[3190.20 → 3190.88] What about Breath of the Wild?
[3191.70 → 3194.04] Oh, Breath of the Wild is the greatest game of all time.
[3194.24 → 3195.18] Did you hear about Breath of the Wild, too?
[3195.64 → 3196.56] I don't think I care.
[3196.94 → 3197.20] Oh.
[3197.72 → 3203.02] What was magic about Breath of the Wild was how utterly different it was.
[3203.18 → 3206.34] I had no temptation whatsoever to download the DLC.
[3207.20 → 3207.54] Okay.
[3208.22 → 3210.02] I was just like...
[3210.02 → 3211.02] I was like...
[3211.02 → 3211.42] You know when you...
[3211.42 → 3213.04] That was a great-contained experience.
[3213.04 → 3213.26] Yeah.
[3213.38 → 3214.16] You know when you finish...
[3214.16 → 3214.76] And I'm very happy with my meal.
[3214.78 → 3216.00] A really great book.
[3216.50 → 3216.76] Yep.
[3217.78 → 3220.68] And you close the last cover and you kind of sit there, and you go,
[3220.88 → 3221.76] Wow.
[3223.76 → 3225.20] They didn't produce Season 8.
[3225.44 → 3225.84] I'm done.
[3225.84 → 3226.00] Awesome.
[3226.70 → 3227.06] Yeah.
[3227.20 → 3227.40] Yeah.
[3227.50 → 3228.06] I'm kind of done.
[3228.18 → 3228.72] But I...
[3228.72 → 3230.68] Man, I put so many hours into Breath of the Wild.
[3230.78 → 3232.20] Like, I just...
[3232.20 → 3232.70] I...
[3232.70 → 3233.80] Yeah.
[3233.80 → 3238.34] I tried to tell myself, no, Final Fantasy VI is still my favourite game.
[3239.06 → 3240.76] But it's just not.
[3240.90 → 3242.10] Like, Breath of the Wild...
[3242.10 → 3243.50] Final Fantasy VI, I still...
[3243.50 → 3245.00] I adore the characters.
[3247.88 → 3248.84] But if I...
[3248.84 → 3252.24] You know if I go back, and I play it as an adult who knows my way through the game,
[3252.36 → 3254.56] there's actually not a lot that happens.
[3256.76 → 3257.52] Whereas...
[3257.52 → 3258.10] And you know what?
[3258.10 → 3259.92] I think the same is probably true for Cross Code.
[3260.00 → 3261.94] Cross Code can get a little grind at times.
[3262.08 → 3263.54] Not that much actually happens.
[3263.66 → 3268.04] But what's great about it is I absolutely adore the characters.
[3268.68 → 3269.48] I still...
[3269.48 → 3270.64] There's a strong connection there.
[3270.72 → 3273.94] I went back and played some of Morning recently.
[3274.10 → 3274.22] Yeah.
[3274.22 → 3276.18] Because Morning's the game that I've always said is my favourite game.
[3276.18 → 3278.08] And I think...
[3278.08 → 3280.18] I think it still is.
[3281.04 → 3281.18] But...
[3281.18 → 3281.74] But...
[3281.74 → 3286.14] I don't think I would have the time or the patience now.
[3286.40 → 3287.82] To play it the way you did.
[3287.96 → 3288.24] Yes.
[3288.26 → 3289.68] And to get out of it what you did.
[3289.76 → 3290.08] Yes.
[3290.14 → 3290.84] That makes sense.
[3290.86 → 3294.84] I don't think I could extract the experience I had with Morning anymore.
[3295.00 → 3296.78] Which makes me really sad.
[3297.54 → 3298.34] But like...
[3298.34 → 3299.12] You're done grew up?
[3299.32 → 3299.68] Yeah.
[3299.80 → 3300.50] To a certain degree.
[3300.50 → 3301.50] Because like...
[3301.50 → 3303.88] The thing with Morning was I...
[3303.88 → 3304.84] The game starts...
[3304.84 → 3306.22] They give you this like package thing.
[3306.32 → 3307.52] And you're supposed to go give it to someone.
[3307.82 → 3309.24] And it was worth something.
[3309.36 → 3310.58] So I just sold it all the time.
[3311.82 → 3314.18] And that was what started the main quest.
[3314.48 → 3318.92] So I actually really thoroughly enjoyed the game for like months.
[3319.50 → 3322.10] Before I realized the game had a main quest.
[3322.26 → 3322.42] Yeah.
[3322.54 → 3323.28] And I was like...
[3323.28 → 3323.60] Oh.
[3324.08 → 3324.52] God.
[3324.86 → 3327.34] And then this unlocked this whole other part of the game.
[3327.34 → 3330.20] And it was very interesting to wander and explore.
[3330.50 → 3332.50] And I don't have the...
[3332.50 → 3333.28] Now I'm like...
[3333.28 → 3334.24] I have time to play a game.
[3334.42 → 3337.30] I must extract enjoyment out of game as much as possible.
[3337.40 → 3338.08] Not just...
[3338.08 → 3339.58] I'm going to go enjoy myself in this space.
[3339.58 → 3341.92] And that's what was so magical about Breath of the Wild to me.
[3342.10 → 3347.66] So most of the games that I've loved a lot have been because I love the characters.
[3347.86 → 3350.14] Like even some of the less popular Final Fantasies.
[3351.52 → 3353.26] I actually...
[3353.26 → 3353.48] No.
[3353.56 → 3354.26] Most of them...
[3354.26 → 3355.34] The characters are kind of cliché.
[3355.34 → 3356.50] I really loved 6.
[3358.28 → 3360.12] So it's because I love the characters.
[3360.50 → 3363.34] And that was something that was a little bit different for Breath of the Wild because
[3363.34 → 3365.86] I loved the exploration.
[3366.92 → 3368.42] Not the...
[3368.42 → 3374.62] Like the Link character is utterly uninteresting to me.
[3375.78 → 3376.26] Okay.
[3376.90 → 3378.14] There's not much to them.
[3378.26 → 3378.46] No.
[3378.84 → 3379.06] No.
[3379.28 → 3382.12] The Zelda character is...
[3382.12 → 3384.46] She might as well be Princess Peach.
[3384.46 → 3387.84] They are completely interchangeable to me.
[3387.92 → 3391.20] They're like a damsel in distress.
[3391.20 → 3397.52] But over the years because, you know, empowerment, they have become strong independent women.
[3398.02 → 3399.84] And that's great.
[3399.84 → 3399.96] Great.
[3400.30 → 3401.66] But that doesn't...
[3401.66 → 3404.22] That's still completely two-dimensional.
[3405.90 → 3407.12] And you know what?
[3407.12 → 3411.58] I'm sure that there's like supplementary manga or something.
[3412.78 → 3412.94] Like...
[3412.94 → 3413.32] Sure.
[3413.90 → 3414.18] Yeah.
[3414.18 → 3414.40] Yeah.
[3414.52 → 3415.54] Some type of additional thing.
[3415.54 → 3417.12] But some people only play the games.
[3417.52 → 3418.74] And you have to...
[3418.74 → 3420.56] Well, if you read the lore...
[3420.56 → 3421.88] You have to give me something to work with here.
[3422.00 → 3423.90] Like Link is literally a silent protagonist.
[3423.90 → 3427.82] And that's a storytelling mechanism.
[3428.06 → 3430.96] But what was magical about Breath of the Wild was definitely the exploration.
[3431.12 → 3433.30] And what I usually love about games is the characters.
[3433.48 → 3434.28] So it's just...
[3434.28 → 3438.02] It's hard for me to admit that my favourite game is not one that's about the characters.
[3438.48 → 3443.24] Especially because I would never go and explore a world that I've already explored.
[3443.50 → 3448.92] But I might go have a story retold to me about characters that I love.
[3449.00 → 3452.20] So for me, Breath of the Wild has no replay value.
[3452.20 → 3458.30] Whereas I have played Final Fantasy VI through to the end at least half a dozen times.
[3458.48 → 3459.06] And like to...
[3459.06 → 3461.08] And almost through probably 20 times.
[3461.20 → 3463.30] To reaffirm all of these points.
[3463.32 → 3463.50] Yeah.
[3463.66 → 3464.78] It's on the same map.
[3465.80 → 3466.20] Oof.
[3467.66 → 3468.10] Yeah.
[3468.70 → 3469.12] Yeah.
[3469.24 → 3469.62] There's no way...
[3469.62 → 3470.72] It's like effectively...
[3470.72 → 3471.80] And you said I wouldn't buy a DLC.
[3472.36 → 3472.66] They were...
[3472.66 → 3473.00] They...
[3473.00 → 3478.74] In one of their interviews, they basically said it would have made sense to be a DLC if
[3478.74 → 3483.26] DLCs were conventionally seen as like multitudes bigger than what they are.
[3483.28 → 3484.64] So it's an expansion pack.
[3484.72 → 3485.56] It's basically...
[3485.56 → 3486.08] So we're back to that.
[3486.28 → 3486.54] Yeah.
[3487.18 → 3487.60] It will...
[3487.60 → 3487.74] Okay.
[3487.78 → 3489.60] They're saying it's like the Major's Mask.
[3490.62 → 3491.94] I never played Major's Mask.
[3492.04 → 3492.70] Me neither actually.
[3493.06 → 3493.28] Okay.
[3493.28 → 3494.60] So I don't know how accurate this is.
[3495.06 → 3497.06] But the Major's Mask to Ocarina of Time.
[3497.34 → 3498.24] Except it's on the same map.
[3498.38 → 3499.26] It's an expansion pack.
[3499.36 → 3500.08] I don't even know if...
[3500.08 → 3500.28] Yeah.
[3500.28 → 3502.36] It's like a huge expansion pack.
[3502.76 → 3502.94] Yeah.
[3502.96 → 3504.42] But the expansion packs are huge.
[3504.52 → 3504.78] Yeah.
[3504.98 → 3505.86] Frozen Throne is huge.
[3505.86 → 3505.96] Whatever.
[3506.86 → 3507.50] Frozen Throne.
[3508.12 → 3508.72] Warcraft 3.
[3509.10 → 3509.72] Oh, no.
[3509.76 → 3510.86] I was going further back than that.
[3510.92 → 3512.26] I was actually going to use Warcraft 2.
[3512.50 → 3513.46] I'm trying to remember...
[3513.46 → 3514.26] Don't tell me.
[3514.30 → 3514.68] Don't tell me.
[3514.72 → 3516.02] It's Warcraft 2 Tides of Darkness.
[3516.30 → 3516.96] Beyond the Dark Portal.
[3517.18 → 3517.32] Yeah.
[3517.92 → 3518.94] It's Beyond the Dark Portal.
[3519.12 → 3523.10] The Beyond the Dark Portal campaign is just as long as the Tides of Darkness campaign.
[3523.10 → 3525.06] If I remember correctly, Frozen Throne campaign is just as long.
[3525.06 → 3525.90] It's just as long.
[3525.94 → 3526.22] You're right.
[3526.24 → 3526.56] It is.
[3526.84 → 3530.02] And it completely overhauls and changes the game.
[3530.02 → 3531.34] But it's the same sort of thing.
[3531.36 → 3534.20] And like Supreme Commander's expansion pack had a campaign that was just as long and added
[3534.20 → 3534.66] a race.
[3535.42 → 3537.28] Like, it's an expansion pack.
[3537.96 → 3538.28] Yeah.
[3538.34 → 3539.72] We just don't call them that anymore, I guess.
[3540.06 → 3540.76] Is someone dying?
[3541.44 → 3542.38] Oh, it's possible.
[3544.68 → 3545.30] All right.
[3545.38 → 3546.12] Time for...
[3546.12 → 3546.32] All right.
[3546.34 → 3548.18] Actually, was there anything else you really wanted to hit today?
[3548.22 → 3549.74] Because otherwise I was going to do some super chats.
[3550.06 → 3554.74] We should maybe talk about LTX because there's a thingy now.
[3554.76 → 3555.40] Oh, right.
[3555.50 → 3557.46] There's like a ton of LTX news.
[3557.60 → 3557.86] Yeah.
[3557.86 → 3560.18] Okay.
[3560.82 → 3564.66] VRRC car is going to include four cars, but isn't a race anymore.
[3564.82 → 3566.64] It's now a first-person view experience.
[3566.92 → 3570.38] So we're designing the tracks, and it'll include some fun little Easter eggs for you guys to
[3570.38 → 3570.66] find.
[3572.76 → 3574.30] That's probably a good idea.
[3574.30 → 3580.02] We'll be playing Robot Recall, Vacation Simulator, and Wind lands 2 at the VR Experience booth
[3580.02 → 3584.70] that will include eight HTC vibes, a big step up from last year's three vibes.
[3584.86 → 3585.00] Yeah.
[3585.10 → 3588.12] And because we couldn't find a sponsor for it, I have to buy them.
[3588.60 → 3589.00] Oof.
[3589.26 → 3589.64] Yeah.
[3590.92 → 3593.34] One of them is going to be my personal vibe because I don't want to like...
[3593.34 → 3594.76] I was going to say, I think you guys have mine still.
[3594.76 → 3595.64] Buy more than I have to.
[3595.92 → 3596.60] I don't think so.
[3596.72 → 3597.58] I don't know where it is.
[3598.10 → 3599.54] Oh, I don't think we have it.
[3599.64 → 3599.92] Sure.
[3600.42 → 3600.80] I don't know.
[3600.92 → 3601.54] I'm not accusing.
[3602.06 → 3602.26] I don't know.
[3602.26 → 3602.48] Okay.
[3602.92 → 3605.24] Either way, if it's there, it'll be there.
[3605.42 → 3606.46] We have new guests.
[3607.18 → 3607.32] Hey.
[3607.46 → 3608.40] Debater's going to be there.
[3608.62 → 3609.24] Oh, sweet.
[3609.28 → 3609.78] Roman's coming.
[3610.04 → 3611.20] Steve from Memory Express.
[3611.74 → 3613.34] And the Hardware Canucks team.
[3613.54 → 3615.12] So Ever and Dimitri are going to be there.
[3615.26 → 3615.60] Nice.
[3615.76 → 3615.94] Yeah.
[3616.04 → 3616.92] So we have...
[3616.92 → 3618.82] We are spending so much money.
[3619.00 → 3619.34] A lot.
[3619.68 → 3620.00] So much money.
[3620.00 → 3621.06] And even more, apparently.
[3622.50 → 3624.22] BYOC seat selection is open.
[3624.34 → 3629.84] If you have a BYOC ticket, head to dream hack forward slash tickets forward slash LTX 19 to
[3629.84 → 3630.30] do that.
[3630.94 → 3633.30] Colton is slowly processing LTX volunteers one by one.
[3633.36 → 3635.60] If you signed up and followed the instructions, please stand by.
[3635.60 → 3640.10] And you can see below our main stage planned events.
[3640.50 → 3640.80] Oh, wow.
[3640.96 → 3641.18] Okay.
[3642.50 → 3642.78] Panel.
[3642.90 → 3643.88] AMD versus Intel.
[3644.26 → 3644.54] Panel.
[3644.54 → 3645.74] PC Dos and Don'ts.
[3645.98 → 3647.52] Industry Insights with MSI.
[3647.58 → 3648.18] That's going to be great.
[3648.24 → 3648.94] We're going to have Cliff out.
[3649.34 → 3649.88] Oh, interesting.
[3649.96 → 3650.14] Yep.
[3650.40 → 3652.56] So, and I already sent him a lot of my questions.
[3652.88 → 3655.58] Like, I'm going to be like, yeah, tell me who's hard to work with.
[3656.04 → 3656.74] Should be good.
[3657.12 → 3658.58] He's pretty sure he's going to get fired.
[3659.34 → 3662.52] We're going to be playing like a family feud sort of funny thing.
[3662.84 → 3665.04] And then we've got a panel running a YouTube business.
[3665.14 → 3665.56] The earlier.
[3665.74 → 3666.78] So that should be an interesting one.
[3667.08 → 3669.14] Now, I'm not the only one on all these panels.
[3669.24 → 3673.30] We're actually going to be leaning on some of our creators to come up and help us with
[3673.30 → 3673.58] these.
[3673.58 → 3680.62] Twitter slash float playing Q&A with LMG part one and two is at 1130 on the second day.
[3681.42 → 3683.04] World of Warships tournament with Linus.
[3683.18 → 3684.12] Never played the game.
[3684.24 → 3685.02] So that'll be interesting.
[3685.42 → 3686.46] Apparently, I get it.
[3686.56 → 3690.92] I get like a stacked like special ship that's like LTT coloured and stuff.
[3691.06 → 3691.40] What?
[3691.40 → 3692.92] So, like people.
[3693.14 → 3697.04] So I, because I don't know how to play the game, I have kind of an advantage.
[3697.34 → 3697.82] So, I don't know.
[3697.86 → 3698.50] It might be interesting.
[3698.56 → 3698.94] Nice, nice, nice.
[3699.34 → 3700.74] PC versus Mac panel.
[3701.16 → 3702.94] Budget versus performance panel.
[3703.06 → 3703.70] Award ceremony.
[3703.86 → 3704.48] And a farewell.
[3705.52 → 3710.94] MSI is apparently sending us 20 little lucky dragons to sell and build on the floor plan.
[3711.04 → 3711.62] Oh my goodness.
[3711.68 → 3712.76] We're showing the floor plan.
[3712.76 → 3715.30] Look at all the updates today.
[3715.80 → 3717.46] Those BYOC seats.
[3717.92 → 3718.56] Oh, dang.
[3718.56 → 3719.82] Yeah, we expanded it.
[3720.42 → 3721.14] Heck yeah.
[3721.58 → 3724.16] Okay, so here's what we're looking.
[3724.28 → 3724.72] Oh my goodness.
[3724.72 → 3725.68] This is a little small.
[3725.72 → 3726.62] I can't read all this stuff.
[3726.70 → 3727.64] It's gigantic though.
[3727.70 → 3730.00] So this is 590 BYOC seats.
[3730.26 → 3733.30] This is PC free play where the systems are already there.
[3733.94 → 3736.32] VIP slash staff slash crew BYOC.
[3736.50 → 3737.40] So that's where you'll be, Luke.
[3737.78 → 3738.06] Okay.
[3738.64 → 3739.82] Here's a stream zone.
[3740.14 → 3742.16] So this is all kind of like dream hacky things.
[3742.32 → 3743.58] Then we've got the stage.
[3743.76 → 3746.06] Then over here, you've got LTX.
[3746.10 → 3747.44] And I'm having a hard time reading.
[3747.44 → 3751.06] So the VIP staff crew BYOC, that's float plane is going to be in there?
[3751.06 → 3752.16] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3752.16 → 3752.54] Yeah, okay.
[3752.68 → 3752.94] Yeah, yeah.
[3753.98 → 3756.14] And then over here is the indie zone.
[3756.32 → 3757.98] I believe this is the case toss.
[3759.40 → 3763.88] I can't read any of this stuff, but maybe it's, I don't know.
[3764.70 → 3765.90] It's super awesome.
[3766.20 → 3768.16] Oh, yes.
[3768.34 → 3769.68] So this is a problem.
[3771.24 → 3775.32] Free geek is actually kind of in trouble.
[3776.30 → 3779.80] So we just wanted to take a moment to shout them out big time
[3779.80 → 3782.08] for being such an amazing supporter of LTX.
[3782.96 → 3786.28] Without them, we wouldn't have been able to get the hundreds of dead motherboards
[3786.28 → 3788.70] to use as the Motherboard House of Cards booth.
[3788.80 → 3791.94] They provided 20 plus cases to throw at the infamous case toss.
[3792.38 → 3795.30] They sourced 20 computers for us to use in the PC build workshop,
[3795.42 → 3797.54] like dead components that people can learn to assemble.
[3797.90 → 3798.00] Yeah.
[3798.10 → 3801.30] Sent us a number of unique motherboards for the Guess That Motherboard booth.
[3801.30 → 3806.08] A lot of this would have been difficult, if not impossible, to do without them.
[3806.24 → 3809.52] So Free geek is a Vancouver-based nonprofit community organization
[3809.52 → 3812.28] that reuses and recycles donated electronics.
[3812.68 → 3817.42] They offer education and job skills training and provide free or low-cost computers to the public.
[3817.58 → 3819.22] They've been an integral part of the event,
[3819.22 → 3822.28] and they're in a bit of a tough spot right now
[3822.28 → 3825.80] because recycling rates are falling.
[3826.40 → 3827.44] And you know what?
[3827.52 → 3828.42] Not too many details,
[3828.62 → 3833.00] but we'd really appreciate your guys' help to help them keep their doors open.
[3833.54 → 3835.14] What they do is kind of important.
[3835.44 → 3837.38] So it's freegeekvancouver.org
[3837.38 → 3839.98] where you can go to learn how you can contribute
[3839.98 → 3848.80] because everything from Scrapyard Wars to Retro Mods to our Sleeper PC series,
[3849.02 → 3854.28] they have hooked us up in ways that are not money,
[3854.48 → 3859.84] but just PC community relationship ways.
[3860.10 → 3863.32] This is the kind of stuff you want in the PC community
[3863.32 → 3867.08] because if you think back to your current or maybe younger self,
[3867.08 → 3868.26] depending on where you're at,
[3868.60 → 3871.14] there's a point in time where if you're really into PCs,
[3871.40 → 3874.30] these types of outlets is what you need to lean on.
[3874.32 → 3876.08] Maybe the only way that you could afford one.
[3876.18 → 3877.92] Yeah, to be completely honest.
[3878.42 → 3885.16] So inspiring new, young, or less financially fortunate minds in our space
[3885.16 → 3887.34] is how it grows.
[3887.90 → 3889.42] All right, so guys, go check it out.
[3889.48 → 3890.78] That's freegeekvancouver.org.
[3891.30 → 3893.76] And we should go ahead and call it some super chats.
[3894.38 → 3895.52] Amari says,
[3895.52 → 3897.30] Finally YouTube Premium got sick of ads.
[3897.52 → 3898.98] Good stuff, and thank you for the $2.
[3900.74 → 3901.70] Jamaican, you too.
[3902.06 → 3904.52] Presumably Logan, Frozen Sniper, you guys too.
[3904.98 → 3905.60] Sup, Spencer.
[3906.26 → 3906.98] Connor says,
[3907.06 → 3908.70] What were you doing with Gavin?
[3909.98 → 3911.32] A couple of really cool things.
[3911.42 → 3913.06] So Gavin from Slo-Mo Guys was here.
[3913.06 → 3913.22] Wait, does Full Plane know?
[3913.22 → 3914.52] I think Full Plane knows what you were doing with Gavin.
[3914.52 → 3915.06] No, they don't.
[3915.26 → 3916.12] That video's not up yet.
[3916.52 → 3916.76] Oh.
[3916.76 → 3918.96] So we did a couple of things.
[3919.28 → 3927.00] We determined once and for all whether 240 hertz monitors have an advantage over 60 hertz for gamers.
[3927.22 → 3927.74] Oh.
[3928.16 → 3928.54] Yeah.
[3929.08 → 3931.18] And in a bunch of fascinating ways.
[3931.18 → 3931.48] Cool.
[3931.48 → 3933.84] So does it affect reaction time?
[3934.48 → 3936.74] Does it affect your kill rate?
[3937.40 → 3939.82] Does it affect the way that you aim?
[3940.74 → 3949.76] So we used slow motion, 1000 frame per second footage to watch how a gamer reacts at 60 hertz versus 240 hertz.
[3949.76 → 3950.44] Did you watch Ed?
[3950.86 → 3951.38] We did.
[3951.54 → 3952.06] Okay, good.
[3952.30 → 3952.54] Wow.
[3952.54 → 3954.44] He's a lot better at 240 hertz.
[3954.74 → 3960.52] But I won't spoil anything else about it because the findings with me and Gavin were also interesting but in completely different ways.
[3960.64 → 3960.84] Yeah.
[3961.14 → 3965.70] I was hoping you were doing a spectrum, but if you weren't doing a spectrum, I was hoping it was Ed.
[3965.92 → 3966.28] We were.
[3966.54 → 3966.68] Yeah.
[3966.74 → 3969.34] So we had Ed at the top, at the top end.
[3969.52 → 3972.26] We had Gavin as more of like a casual.
[3972.70 → 3976.12] And then we had me as sort of like I used to be okay, I guess.
[3978.54 → 3979.58] You're good at games.
[3979.80 → 3981.60] My aim is fantastic, actually.
[3981.60 → 3983.96] My spread was pretty close to Ed's.
[3984.48 → 3984.60] Wow.
[3984.90 → 3985.48] But.
[3986.50 → 3987.38] What game?
[3987.66 → 3992.04] My kill time was much higher.
[3993.02 → 3994.96] We used CSGO with an auto snipe.
[3995.28 → 3995.60] Okay.
[3996.16 → 4001.70] And then we had a target basically at an undetermined time.
[4002.70 → 4008.24] Well, the reason for the auto snipe was we wanted to give the if you got a headshot, you took them down in one.
[4008.32 → 4009.66] We told everyone to go for headshots.
[4009.66 → 4015.74] But if you hit a body shot, we wanted it to be possible to take down the target in the time that you had while they ran across the hallway.
[4016.06 → 4016.16] Okay.
[4016.80 → 4020.40] So you basically had to, you had a pixel that you had to point at.
[4020.40 → 4023.06] And then you didn't know when that was going to come.
[4023.06 → 4026.46] And you had to take them out as fast as you could as you ran across.
[4027.62 → 4027.94] Interesting.
[4028.14 → 4028.56] Very interesting.
[4028.58 → 4029.74] Really, really cool test.
[4030.22 → 4042.70] And then what we did with the knowledge that we gained from working with Gavin was we produced a second video the next day determining once and for all whether wireless mice are slower.
[4042.70 → 4042.88] Ooh.
[4042.88 → 4053.24] So we devised a mechanism to hit a mouse, complete a circuit, light up a light to show us the exact moment that they make contact.
[4053.24 → 4065.92] And then we were able to use one millisecond frames at a thousand frames per second to see how long it takes the crosshair on the monitor behind it to start to move.
[4065.92 → 4074.42] So we weren't able to actually determine down to one millisecond which mouse was faster because we don't have the equipment to measure that.
[4074.48 → 4076.36] We can't intercept the signal from the mouse.
[4076.58 → 4085.48] But we were able to tell if any monitor on the market could possibly give you the feedback fast enough that you could detect a difference.
[4085.74 → 4085.78] Yeah.
[4086.04 → 4089.10] And it's going to be a really, fascinating video.
[4090.22 → 4091.50] So that's what I was doing with Gavin.
[4091.50 → 4098.22] And Commissioner says, if the 64 core Thread ripper was cheap, not sure where you're going with that because it sure as heck won't be.
[4098.98 → 4103.12] Sup, Jason, Will Briggs, Westerly, Derek.
[4103.76 → 4105.40] YouTube Premium gives free super chats.
[4105.50 → 4107.56] I think that's what like most of this is.
[4107.88 → 4110.12] Zach says, put it towards some tooling for the mill.
[4110.70 → 4113.58] Oh, man, that workshop is going to be freaking awesome.
[4114.08 → 4116.78] See Bart, hashtag save channel super fun.
[4116.84 → 4117.46] 20 bucks.
[4117.92 → 4119.24] If only it were that.
[4119.24 → 4120.80] If only it was 20 bucks.
[4120.80 → 4128.20] You know what's hilarious is it is not impossible that channel super fun could end up resurrected as part of this diversification push.
[4128.38 → 4129.10] We'll see.
[4130.10 → 4131.14] It's not dead.
[4131.58 → 4133.04] It's just online support.
[4133.30 → 4136.24] You want to know a fun little fact here?
[4136.40 → 4137.26] Remember the pigeon?
[4137.84 → 4138.76] The pigeon?
[4138.98 → 4140.32] I think it's called a pigeon.
[4142.82 → 4145.38] Apple pigeon console.
[4146.56 → 4146.84] Pippin.
[4146.92 → 4147.62] Oh, the Pippin.
[4147.62 → 4148.52] Yeah, yeah, the At mark.
[4148.52 → 4151.26] It's probably paid for itself by now.
[4151.78 → 4152.28] Has it?
[4152.32 → 4153.64] It's like 3 million views or something.
[4153.66 → 4153.92] Really?
[4154.08 → 4154.28] Yeah.
[4154.48 → 4156.14] How much did we pay for that stupid thing again?
[4156.30 → 4157.16] I think it was 500 bucks.
[4157.20 → 4157.50] Oh!
[4159.58 → 4159.98] Oh!
[4160.18 → 4163.80] Can literally buy like a brand new Xbox One X for what we paid for it.
[4163.94 → 4165.18] The worst console ever.
[4165.18 → 4166.68] And like a game and some controllers.
[4166.98 → 4167.18] Yeah.
[4167.18 → 4170.10] Yeah, 3 million views.
[4170.30 → 4170.78] Hell yeah.
[4171.26 → 4171.74] What's up, Nick?
[4172.14 → 4173.38] You guys talking about the merch store yet?
[4173.40 → 4175.30] Oh, oh, he wants us to talk about the merch.
[4176.04 → 4178.18] So this is our hot item right now.
[4178.50 → 4180.22] This hoodie is finally for sale.
[4180.48 → 4180.74] Yeah.
[4180.86 → 4181.60] Did you get one yet?
[4182.00 → 4182.40] Okay.
[4182.40 → 4184.02] Oh, really?
[4184.74 → 4185.18] Ouch.
[4185.52 → 4188.26] Nick is my saviour because my luggage was lost.
[4188.70 → 4189.72] You lost it?
[4189.88 → 4190.74] No, I did not.
[4190.86 → 4191.12] No.
[4191.78 → 4192.82] An airline did.
[4193.96 → 4196.24] An airline did.
[4196.40 → 4197.28] 100%.
[4197.28 → 4197.70] Okay.
[4197.96 → 4199.36] And my sweater was in there.
[4199.48 → 4201.58] But Nick swooped in and got me another one.
[4201.62 → 4201.86] All right.
[4201.86 → 4203.12] So this is the one.
[4203.34 → 4204.04] He did.
[4204.90 → 4205.88] But either way.
[4205.88 → 4209.06] This is the one that's like the hot seller on the store right now.
[4209.06 → 4210.48] It's LTTstore.com.
[4210.90 → 4214.30] It's got like a little logo here.
[4214.54 → 4217.96] It's got the phone pocket on this side that holds even huge phones.
[4218.04 → 4219.00] This is an early prototype.
[4219.68 → 4225.42] So actually we had enlarged the phone pocket after this one because it didn't really fit very well.
[4225.48 → 4226.66] It was like hard to get it in and out.
[4227.68 → 4230.56] Also, this one, see how yours goes a little bit lower?
[4231.44 → 4235.86] We made it about an inch longer because this is an early one because it was always riding up on me.
[4235.88 → 4241.40] I also have a rather tall torso, and it fits on me perfectly fine.
[4241.48 → 4244.96] I know some people ask about how different fitting things work.
[4245.12 → 4245.36] So yeah.
[4245.56 → 4248.44] We changed the zipper to PKK instead of whatever this is.
[4248.74 → 4249.80] That's good.
[4250.02 → 4250.18] Yeah.
[4250.30 → 4253.90] So we made some quality and some we arability improvements.
[4254.20 → 4259.76] That's why these projects take so long because you're sending feedback.
[4260.14 → 4261.38] You're waiting for new samples.
[4261.72 → 4262.72] You're sending more feedback.
[4262.94 → 4263.84] You're waiting for new samples.
[4263.84 → 4269.30] If it was just as simple as like getting a shirt printed, this merch stuff would have paid for itself ages ago.
[4269.38 → 4277.24] As it is, we're making money on every item we sell, but we're deep in the red in terms of the total investment that we put in.
[4277.42 → 4281.74] But honestly, I'm so much happier wearing our stuff now.
[4281.74 → 4288.50] As an outside party, the stuff I was most upset about losing in that like, okay, one random little tidbit.
[4288.74 → 4294.14] I lost literally every single pair of bottoms that I own except for these shorts that I'm wearing in that luggage.
[4294.62 → 4294.88] Wow.
[4295.02 → 4295.10] Bummer.
[4295.10 → 4296.16] Because I don't have very many bottoms.
[4296.16 → 4299.98] It's going to take you a long time to get free bottoms to replace those bottoms because I know you won't pay for them.
[4299.98 → 4301.64] That's why I only had that many.
[4301.68 → 4302.06] I know.
[4302.14 → 4305.18] It's because those are the same jeans I've had for like seven years.
[4305.18 → 4305.82] I believe you.
[4307.70 → 4311.26] But okay, as an outside source, the shirts are insanely comfortable.
[4311.60 → 4315.42] The Constellation one is actually my like favourite shirt, which is also gone.
[4315.44 → 4316.44] It's out of stock right now.
[4316.56 → 4318.00] We're working on getting more.
[4318.20 → 4320.14] The problem is we can't get that colour of shirt.
[4320.14 → 4323.04] And so we're working on an overseas source.
[4323.74 → 4334.08] But unless it meets the standard of the ones that we are using now, we are just, we'd rather be completely out of stock and not sell anything than compromise anymore.
[4334.14 → 4334.94] I'm just tired of it.
[4335.06 → 4335.62] And it's insane.
[4335.76 → 4336.80] I'm just going to step in again.
[4336.96 → 4337.92] Still outside source.
[4338.62 → 4339.68] Your shirts are 20 bucks.
[4340.30 → 4340.50] Yeah.
[4340.68 → 4343.30] Basically, no influencer shirts are 20 bucks right now.
[4343.54 → 4349.72] $20 a shirt is the like five to 10 years ago pricing for most of this kind of stuff, which is pretty awesome.
[4349.72 → 4351.04] The shirts feel great.
[4351.10 → 4351.76] The printing is great.
[4351.98 → 4356.04] The sweaters are thin, which is usually bad, but it's not.
[4356.36 → 4359.16] No, it's like a French Terry.
[4359.44 → 4359.66] Yeah.
[4359.80 → 4361.14] Like it's not like a cheap thin.
[4361.28 → 4363.20] I haven't had a sweater like this before.
[4363.72 → 4365.38] Every thin sweater that I've had sucked.
[4365.48 → 4366.30] This one's fantastic.
[4366.66 → 4371.54] I slept with it over my face when I didn't have another option while I was in Taiwan.
[4371.70 → 4372.08] It was great.
[4372.18 → 4372.76] And then it's gone.
[4373.04 → 4374.36] And I was really sad, and I got a new one.
[4374.50 → 4376.88] We're trying to keep the pricing reasonable.
[4377.14 → 4378.12] That's like one of the big things.
[4378.12 → 4379.04] $60 for a sweater.
[4379.04 → 4381.54] Again, sweaters are kind of expensive.
[4381.98 → 4384.54] But it takes us a long time to make this stuff.
[4385.06 → 4385.30] Yeah.
[4385.70 → 4386.10] Yeah.
[4386.54 → 4387.14] It is what it is.
[4387.14 → 4388.08] Geez, Luke, go buy some pants.
[4388.22 → 4389.30] Well, I have to now.
[4389.78 → 4390.12] Okay?
[4390.74 → 4391.50] So I will.
[4391.66 → 4391.90] Whatever.
[4392.10 → 4392.32] Maybe we'll start.
[4393.00 → 4394.66] Lloyd really wants to do joggers.
[4395.64 → 4396.46] Joggers would be dope.
[4396.72 → 4398.12] I don't really like them, though.
[4398.22 → 4404.04] So my new thing with the merch, actually, I listened to a talk from Kris Jenner, of all people.
[4404.04 → 4406.00] You know what?
[4406.04 → 4409.54] You can say what you want about the content, but you have to respect the business savvy.
[4410.92 → 4415.30] And she was like, look, focus.
[4416.46 → 4419.08] Focus on what you actually are passionate about.
[4419.08 → 4421.84] And it's a lot harder to screw up.
[4422.54 → 4427.26] And so I'm going, you know, so I got back to the office and I cancelled the joggers project.
[4427.68 → 4428.04] Okay.
[4428.12 → 4429.20] Because I don't care about them.
[4429.28 → 4429.54] Okay.
[4429.84 → 4433.68] And I was like, nope, we're going to do stuff that I care about a lot.
[4433.84 → 4435.26] So the underwear that's coming?
[4435.50 → 4435.76] Yeah.
[4436.30 → 4437.14] It's really nice.
[4437.14 → 4437.94] Okay, good.
[4438.00 → 4441.44] Because I lost also a very high percentage of my underwear.
[4441.78 → 4442.34] The underwear.
[4442.96 → 4443.12] The underwear.
[4443.16 → 4446.26] Fairly soon, literally my entire wardrobe is just going to be LTD stuff.
[4446.28 → 4446.68] The underwear is sweet.
[4446.68 → 4447.62] Which I'm okay with.
[4447.96 → 4449.58] It's like really nice.
[4449.74 → 4449.96] Yeah.
[4450.20 → 4450.64] That's awesome.
[4451.24 → 4451.58] Anyway.
[4452.18 → 4456.00] Connor says, can you recommend a battery pack that can power a USB-C powered laptop?
[4456.20 → 4456.52] I don't know.
[4456.54 → 4459.28] Anything from like, like Anchor stuff is pretty.
[4459.46 → 4459.64] Anchor.
[4459.64 → 4459.94] Anchor.
[4459.96 → 4461.10] Just go Anchor, I guess.
[4464.10 → 4464.98] Weekend Gaming Nerds.
[4464.98 → 4467.32] Wow, we're getting so many free super chats.
[4468.06 → 4469.26] Guys, thank you.
[4469.64 → 4476.28] Twigs, Dark stalker, Amaral, Lee Gamer, Matt, Aaron, Marcos.
[4476.66 → 4479.02] This is the new CPU shirt, and it's super cool.
[4479.38 → 4479.54] Yeah.
[4480.18 → 4482.76] I like that it doesn't really look like tech.
[4483.30 → 4486.20] Yeah, but if you can also identify it.
[4486.20 → 4486.38] Yeah.
[4488.48 → 4489.44] Distro Tube.
[4489.44 → 4490.36] This show is cool.
[4490.46 → 4493.66] Have you guys ever considered switching to new slash Linux?
[4493.66 → 4498.76] Find out more about free software freedom and the new project at new.org.
[4499.44 → 4500.26] Oh, thank you.
[4500.52 → 4501.04] Sweet.
[4501.12 → 4502.48] We had never heard of that.
[4504.60 → 4508.24] Let me get right on that for our Adobe Premiere editing workflow.
[4509.32 → 4512.66] Well, I'm not, I'm not trying to be a hater.
[4512.66 → 4514.44] We use Linux where it makes sense.
[4514.58 → 4516.74] Like our storage servers, for example.
[4517.20 → 4517.62] Float plane.
[4517.64 → 4519.76] All of Luke's float plane crap runs on Linux.
[4519.86 → 4520.02] Yeah.
[4520.24 → 4525.50] But we're not ready to advocate switching to Linux for like a media production environment.
[4525.66 → 4527.12] It's not, it's not a thing yet.
[4527.76 → 4532.84] And before you send another super chat, which I appreciate by the way, about da Vinci Resolve.
[4532.84 → 4534.84] Yes, we're aware of it, but it doesn't do everything.
[4537.76 → 4546.48] Michael, Freddy, Lazar, Lachlan, Danny, Arash, thank you very much.
[4547.02 → 4548.54] Midland says, good evening, guys.
[4548.62 → 4552.60] Wondering if there's a way to clone an internal SSD to an internal software RAID 1 SSD array.
[4552.60 → 4558.04] That is a tremendous question, and I have actually tried to figure out how to do it.
[4558.10 → 4563.32] I don't know why with the Intel RAID, when you create it, you can't just say,
[4563.76 → 4569.36] hey, all of that, that one drive, that one's good.
[4569.82 → 4571.20] All of that to the other one too.
[4571.82 → 4573.46] You have to clear them when you create it.
[4573.48 → 4577.38] And it seems like the kind of thing that I do know that there are,
[4577.38 → 4583.18] like there are values that you write when you create a RAID that kind of tie the two together.
[4583.48 → 4587.42] It just seems like the kind of thing that someone over the last couple of decades
[4587.42 → 4589.28] might have engineered a solution to by now.
[4589.62 → 4595.22] As far as I'm aware, I don't know of a way to do it.
[4595.26 → 4595.62] I'm sorry.
[4596.60 → 4599.96] Rehab says, the search on Flow plane is there, but it doesn't seem to be effective.
[4600.08 → 4601.20] Yeah, I know.
[4601.30 → 4602.06] They're working on it.
[4602.16 → 4602.32] Yep.
[4603.12 → 4605.78] There's actually like a fix for it, but it's just not up yet.
[4605.78 → 4608.68] Lorenz, sorry, don't think about quitting.
[4608.88 → 4610.18] I really miss you lately on the channel.
[4610.26 → 4610.56] Don't worry.
[4610.66 → 4611.72] I'm not going anywhere.
[4612.78 → 4616.20] QWERTY, to be honest, I love all the other staff, but if you're done, I am too.
[4616.42 → 4618.24] I like having the variety, but I'm here for you.
[4618.30 → 4619.70] I appreciate that.
[4619.96 → 4624.56] But also, I appreciate the support for the rest of the staff because they're awesome.
[4626.48 → 4628.64] Niche requests podcasts.
[4628.92 → 4629.28] Interesting.
[4629.98 → 4631.46] Ben Burrell says, water cool the new Mac Pro.
[4631.54 → 4632.40] We're going to create our own new Mac Pro.
[4632.40 → 4633.34] This is a podcast.
[4633.68 → 4634.92] Yeah, this is a podcast, by the way.
[4634.92 → 4635.64] We already have a podcast.
[4636.60 → 4638.64] Jacksonville said story-driven podcasts.
[4638.80 → 4639.04] No.
[4639.28 → 4639.44] What?
[4639.60 → 4640.50] Like Reply All.
[4641.44 → 4642.82] Watching your rig upgrade.
[4642.98 → 4643.74] Thunderbolt config.
[4644.02 → 4644.82] Is it still in the closet?
[4644.94 → 4645.18] Okay.
[4645.44 → 4650.04] So, I had to rip the Gigabyte board back out that night and put my old board back in because
[4650.04 → 4652.84] I don't have a Thunderbolt 3 to Thunderbolt 2 adapter.
[4654.30 → 4657.96] So, really sad story, especially because Brandon and I stayed late to finish that video.
[4658.06 → 4658.64] Oh, no.
[4658.74 → 4663.24] So, I ended up reusing that motherboard in a you know what, I won't spoil it, but there's
[4663.24 → 4664.18] more videos coming up.
[4664.18 → 4665.70] That narrative is far from done.
[4667.84 → 4670.90] Nail says, hey, Linus, you're paying too much attention to the feedback.
[4671.30 → 4673.32] Great to have the feedback, but do what you like, man.
[4673.38 → 4675.24] We enjoy seeing you do the stuff you enjoy.
[4675.48 → 4676.32] So, that's good.
[4676.50 → 4677.18] That's important.
[4677.58 → 4680.96] But also, I do need to take feedback because it does matter, too.
[4681.04 → 4682.32] It's just, like, filtering it.
[4682.40 → 4683.04] That's the key.
[4684.04 → 4686.52] Dave, just because I want to one-up a rash.
[4686.52 → 4687.72] Sends $24.99.
[4688.04 → 4688.82] Oh, thanks, Dave.
[4688.82 → 4691.44] Luke needs a chair that says, at float plane.
[4692.46 → 4693.24] He does.
[4693.38 → 4693.54] Oh.
[4694.34 → 4694.66] Yeah.
[4695.34 → 4696.00] That'd be cool.
[4696.12 → 4697.18] What a terrific point.
[4697.66 → 4698.70] Um, okay.
[4700.42 → 4701.86] And in, like, blue.
[4702.42 → 4705.16] Jesus Franco says, YouTube gave me this, so here you go.
[4705.16 → 4708.84] Game Breaker says, yo, Linus, what did I miss?
[4708.90 → 4710.28] I only joined, like, a minute ago.
[4712.08 → 4713.12] Are you for real, bro?
[4714.78 → 4717.48] We're just going to recap the whole LAN show?
[4720.56 → 4721.26] You know what?
[4721.76 → 4722.98] You can't blame a guy for trying.
[4723.64 → 4724.72] You've got to respect that.
[4724.80 → 4725.82] At least you took a shot.
[4725.86 → 4726.68] You've got to try things.
[4726.68 → 4726.86] Yeah.
[4726.98 → 4727.80] But, yeah, you know what?
[4727.94 → 4728.12] Yeah.
[4728.50 → 4729.58] Shoot for the moon, right?
[4729.58 → 4734.82] Because if you miss, then it might come down on an old lady somewhere.
[4734.96 → 4735.18] Yeah.
[4738.46 → 4740.00] Um, thanks, Lanai.
[4740.36 → 4742.66] Jake says, would love a vlog channel.
[4743.16 → 4743.52] Nope.
[4743.88 → 4744.30] I'm out.
[4744.42 → 4744.78] I'm done.
[4745.06 → 4745.78] I'm telling you, man.
[4746.52 → 4747.48] I'm telling you, man.
[4748.24 → 4750.58] I actually have a pretty good vlog channel idea.
[4750.98 → 4753.56] I don't have time to do it right now, though, but it's, like, it's pretty different.
[4753.90 → 4754.46] It's pretty different.
[4755.42 → 4757.30] Um, oh, wow.
[4757.30 → 4758.96] I don't know if I can get through all these.
[4759.58 → 4763.50] Whenever we do Super Chats, like, earlier in the show, and people are like, oh, wow,
[4763.54 → 4766.56] they're actually going to remember Super Chats today, we get a bunch of them, and then we
[4766.56 → 4767.18] can't finish them.
[4768.40 → 4772.06] I would strongly recommend, if you guys want to, like, do Super Chats, do them earlier
[4772.06 → 4774.40] in the show, because then we'll get to those first.
[4774.84 → 4776.12] If we don't.
[4777.04 → 4779.62] Uh, Iceberg says, what do you think about this setup?
[4780.46 → 4788.76] An Epic 7401P with 64 gigs of DDR4-ECC, five GTX 1080s, and a 4x480 gig SSD on an MZ31 AR0
[4788.76 → 4789.12] motherboard.
[4789.30 → 4792.84] Sounds like a machine learning setup or something.
[4793.42 → 4794.16] You have to be careful.
[4794.42 → 4795.24] Weird config.
[4795.50 → 4798.60] What you're inviting is config feedback from everyone.
[4798.84 → 4799.18] Oh, yeah.
[4799.28 → 4799.40] No.
[4799.46 → 4799.88] Oh, right.
[4800.00 → 4800.40] Yeah, I'm sorry.
[4800.46 → 4800.98] I don't do that.
[4801.20 → 4803.34] Go post on the new builds section of the forum.
[4803.48 → 4803.70] Yes.
[4803.88 → 4804.36] Thank you, Luke.
[4804.40 → 4804.76] Good call.
[4804.86 → 4805.32] No problem.
[4805.76 → 4806.12] Um.
[4806.12 → 4808.14] I do this stuff sometimes.
[4808.76 → 4809.06] Okay.
[4809.30 → 4809.70] All right.
[4811.28 → 4812.56] Ba-DA-ba-da-da-da-da.
[4813.36 → 4814.10] Make sure.
[4814.42 → 4814.66] Okay.
[4814.80 → 4814.94] Yeah.
[4815.02 → 4815.38] And we're done.
[4815.62 → 4816.18] Bye, guys.
[4816.36 → 4816.62] Bye.
[4816.86 → 4817.58] See you again next week.
[4817.64 → 4818.12] Same bad time.
[4818.18 → 4818.80] Same bad channel.
[4819.20 → 4819.72] See ya.
[4820.40 → 4820.68] Whoops.
[4821.28 → 4821.68] There we go.
[4821.68 → 4826.76] I'm so upset that it's still not up.
[4828.32 → 4829.42] I got so hot.
[4830.30 → 4831.30] I blur.
[4831.46 → 4835.38] Says, I have two friends that are 4xL and can't ever find YouTube merch that fits.
[4835.94 → 4838.90] I think right now we only go up to 3xL, guys.
[4838.90 → 4839.62] Um.
[4840.72 → 4842.38] Man, we could try.
[4842.52 → 4852.10] But what I'll say is that even 3xL, a lot of the merch that we source is like, the really
[4852.10 → 4856.02] nice shirts that we're talking about, how great they are, are not available in that size.
[4856.12 → 4858.26] So even our 3xL, I believe, is a different shirt.
[4858.70 → 4859.12] Oh, really?
[4859.26 → 4859.50] Yeah.
[4860.26 → 4860.60] All right.
[4861.06 → 4861.54] Bye for real.
