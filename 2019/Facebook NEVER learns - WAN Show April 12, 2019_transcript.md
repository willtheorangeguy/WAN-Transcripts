[0.00 --> 5.74]  Welcome to the WAN Show. It's on time. Weird, isn't it? It's crazy. It's like someone isn't here.
[6.16 --> 12.62]  We've got some pretty interesting topics this week. Valve to address review bombing in new update to user review systems.
[13.16 --> 21.22]  Interesting. Also, even potentially more interesting, Facebook patent to use user ads, user photos, as ads.
[22.06 --> 27.00]  Also, Amazon workers may be listening to you through your Echo device.
[27.00 --> 27.40]  Done.
[27.52 --> 29.30]  All this and more. Roll the intro.
[29.50 --> 29.84]  Boom.
[30.00 --> 31.46]  Wow.
[33.64 --> 34.06]  Yeah.
[44.56 --> 45.36]  It's Friday.
[51.02 --> 51.50]  Squarespace.
[51.58 --> 51.94]  Squarespace.
[53.32 --> 54.80]  Private Internet Access.
[54.90 --> 55.72]  P.I.A.
[56.72 --> 58.86]  And I'm trying to do this thing over here.
[58.86 --> 60.80]  Displate.
[61.66 --> 62.22]  Displate.
[62.94 --> 63.58]  Displate.
[63.78 --> 64.26]  Displate.
[64.72 --> 65.64]  Displate right here.
[66.94 --> 68.00]  Displate behind me.
[68.60 --> 70.16]  Let me just make sure this thing is going.
[70.32 --> 71.20]  Looks like it is.
[71.30 --> 71.90]  And we're back.
[71.94 --> 72.50]  We're back, baby.
[72.94 --> 73.68]  There we go.
[73.90 --> 74.46]  See displate?
[75.20 --> 75.58]  Yes.
[75.58 --> 75.70]  Yes.
[75.70 --> 79.70]  We'll get to that. But first...
[79.70 --> 85.70]  Valve, addressing review bombing. You see this pretty often, actually.
[85.70 --> 87.70]  Review bombing, that is?
[87.70 --> 88.70]  Yeah.
[88.70 --> 89.70]  Tell us about it.
[89.70 --> 97.70]  So, like, a new game will come out, especially for smaller games, where like, 100, 200 reviews is gonna be a very significant portion of the reviews on the platform.
[97.70 --> 102.70]  You will see Brigading, where like, a group of people decide that they don't like, or that they do like.
[102.70 --> 106.70]  I've actually, I believe review bombing has happened in the other direction as well.
[106.70 --> 109.70]  It's something that's probably more common on Amazon.
[109.70 --> 112.70]  Like, we need to, it's basically upvoting it. Let's get this to the front page.
[112.70 --> 117.70]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just like how on Amazon people can buy positive reviews.
[117.70 --> 122.70]  I don't necessarily know if this stuff is purchased, but you'll get a group of people that, whether they've really played a game or not,
[122.70 --> 127.70]  they have like one minute on record, they're like, this is the greatest thing ever! Very positive review.
[127.70 --> 134.70]  So yeah, I think it goes in both directions. And the ways that Valve wants to address this, I think are pretty interesting.
[134.70 --> 139.70]  This is driving me nuts! There's these headphones that are plugged in right now, and everything we say is coming out of them.
[139.70 --> 142.70]  Oh! I couldn't hear that. And I can just vaguely hear it on the side.
[142.70 --> 149.70]  So when review bombing happens, is that usually when the game comes out, or is it sometimes just randomly like five years later?
[149.70 --> 152.70]  No. Yeah, it can happen way later down the line too.
[152.70 --> 158.70]  One of the interesting ones is like a patch will come out, or an expansion or something, and it'll get tanked at that point in time.
[158.70 --> 161.70]  And on Steam you can see all time and recent.
[161.70 --> 168.70]  So if you're viewing a game and like the all time is very positive, but the recent is like very negative, that's pretty bad as well.
[168.70 --> 179.70]  So it can take a surprisingly low amount of reviews to really sway people's perceptions, because if you have enough people to slam a game that's decently old,
[179.70 --> 188.70]  but you can make the recent go to very positive or very negative, or whatever way you want to push it, you can really affect people's decisions on things.
[188.70 --> 191.70]  So where are those brigades organized?
[191.70 --> 195.70]  Does that usually happen on the subreddit for the game, or Discord, or?
[195.70 --> 198.70]  Gaming subreddits, gaming Discord, there's a bunch of different ways.
[198.70 --> 202.70]  I think there's also a little bit where like, this is almost more of a mentality thing.
[202.70 --> 213.70]  So I think there's two other things going on too, is one, if you're like, eh, I'm not really sure, and then you see the game, and it has mixed reviews, you'll probably go, yeah, and give it a mixed review.
[213.70 --> 219.70]  If you're like, eh, I'm not really sure, but everyone else is rating it very positive, you might go like, eh, it was pretty alright.
[219.70 --> 223.70]  So I think there's some that happens where it's just things are swayed.
[223.70 --> 230.70]  But another problem that they're going after is something that I saw on, and this actually pissed me off.
[230.70 --> 235.70]  I saw this on a local review of Mucho Burrito recently.
[235.70 --> 236.70]  Okay.
[236.70 --> 244.70]  Some guy rated it one star, because he ordered some Mucho Burrito from Skip the Dishes, and the like, delivery was late or something.
[244.70 --> 246.70]  Ah, that's weak.
[246.70 --> 248.70]  That's a completely unrelated thing.
[248.70 --> 252.70]  And one of the ways that Valve wants to address this is to...
[252.70 --> 254.70]  This is actually exactly what they're talking about.
[254.70 --> 255.70]  Yeah.
[255.70 --> 256.70]  With this new announcement.
[256.70 --> 257.70]  They want to deal with off-topic review.
[257.70 --> 261.70]  Right, so let's just like, introduce it in terms of the article.
[261.70 --> 262.70]  Yeah.
[262.70 --> 272.70]  So in an effort to keep games' review scores, which is something we didn't talk about yet, is not only are people leaving reviews, but the reviews they leave are contributing to an overall review score.
[272.70 --> 290.70]  In an effort to keep the game's review score as a meaningful indicator for whether or not someone should buy the game, Valve is now rolling out a new review system for Steam that detects off-topic review bombing and removes the impact of these reviews from the game's review store.
[290.70 --> 291.70]  Important distinction there.
[291.70 --> 292.70]  Yeah.
[292.70 --> 293.70]  Important distinction there.
[293.70 --> 294.70]  They are not removing the reviews.
[294.70 --> 296.70]  The reviews are staying on there.
[296.70 --> 297.70]  You can still read all of them.
[297.70 --> 298.70]  Yeah.
[298.70 --> 302.70]  They're just removing the contribution of those reviews to the overall score.
[302.70 --> 303.70]  It's not fair.
[303.70 --> 309.70]  Let's say there's a lot of the off-topic DRM things are like, or about DRM.
[309.70 --> 310.70]  Yeah.
[310.70 --> 311.70]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[311.70 --> 314.70]  Or it's just, in Steam's estimation here, they have a little criteria that they decided.
[314.70 --> 317.70]  I do kind of think that should affect it personally, but.
[317.70 --> 319.70]  Well, this is the meat of this topic.
[319.70 --> 320.70]  Yeah.
[320.70 --> 321.70]  It's the gray area.
[321.70 --> 325.70]  So we've already defined for you what a review bomb is.
[325.70 --> 328.70]  Now let's talk about what an off-topic review bomb is.
[328.70 --> 338.70]  Steam says, when the focus of those reviews is on a topic that Valve considers unrelated to the likelihood that future purchasers will be happy if they buy the game,
[338.70 --> 342.70]  and hence not something that should be added to the review score.
[342.70 --> 344.70]  Okay.
[344.70 --> 350.70]  Yeah, see, because if we pull this away from gaming temporarily, if you wanted to review something on Rotten Tomatoes,
[350.70 --> 359.70]  and you went to go review Hellboy, which is currently 11 out of 100, and you were like,
[359.70 --> 361.70]  think about it on both sides.
[361.70 --> 369.70]  If you wanted to rate a movie a zero, or just don't do it because it's Rotten Tomatoes, because you went to the theater and the popcorn sucked,
[369.70 --> 370.70]  that would be really stupid.
[370.70 --> 372.70]  Just like the skip the dishes thing.
[372.70 --> 373.70]  Yeah.
[373.70 --> 379.70]  If you wanted to review Hellboy as definitely go watch it because the popcorn was great, that's equally stupid.
[379.70 --> 383.70]  So like, I like the getting rid of off-topic things.
[383.70 --> 391.70]  I am going to be very interested in what they deem as off-topic because the DRM thing is extremely on-topic in my opinion.
[391.70 --> 396.70]  So, on their announcement blog, there's a section at the bottom underneath where they outline what they're doing.
[396.70 --> 402.70]  They have a Q&A section and DRM is actually specifically called out there.
[402.70 --> 409.70]  And the Q part is, I care about some things that I worry other players don't, like DRM or EULA changes.
[409.70 --> 411.70]  Review bombs have been-
[411.70 --> 413.70]  EULA changes are also super important.
[413.70 --> 415.70]  Review bombs have been about them in the past.
[415.70 --> 417.70]  Do you consider them unrelated or off-topic?
[417.70 --> 422.70]  And the answer is, we had long debates about these two and others like them.
[422.70 --> 426.70]  They're technically not part of the game, but they are an issue for some players.
[426.70 --> 435.70]  In the end, we decided to define them as off-topic because the general Steam player doesn't care as much about them.
[435.70 --> 438.70]  So, the review score is more accurate if it doesn't contain them.
[438.70 --> 446.70]  In addition, we believe that players who do care about topics like DRM are often willing to dig a little deeper into games before purchasing,
[446.70 --> 449.70]  which is why we still keep all the reviews within the review bombs.
[449.70 --> 453.70]  It only takes a minute to dig into those reviews to see if the issue is something you care about.
[453.70 --> 454.70]  Which basically no one's going to do.
[454.70 --> 459.70]  Well, they're saying that the people who care about the issues like DRM are the kind who would do that.
[459.70 --> 466.70]  I care about issues like DRM and I don't have the freaking time to read through every damn review on your freaking game.
[466.70 --> 468.70]  Fair enough.
[469.70 --> 470.70]  Sass.
[470.70 --> 471.70]  Sass face.
[471.70 --> 477.70]  I just, that's really annoying to me because games like, I don't even know if this was on Steam to be completely honest,
[477.70 --> 484.70]  but the newer Assassin's Creed games, Origins I believe specifically, had a Denuvo or something.
[484.70 --> 487.70]  I think it had like three different layers of DRM and it was crippling.
[487.70 --> 495.70]  I did a stream of that game when it first came out and ran my CPU usage statistics the entire time I was playing
[495.70 --> 498.70]  and would like go into different areas and look at things as well benchmarking it.
[498.70 --> 502.70]  Because I was like, holy crap, this thing is thrashing me way harder than it should be.
[502.70 --> 504.70]  And it was really interesting to test.
[504.70 --> 508.70]  That doesn't mean it's a good game for people because the system's getting thrashed and I found it interesting.
[508.70 --> 510.70]  It does not mean it's good for the general person.
[510.70 --> 516.70]  But I do think a lot of people should know because it was genuinely really hard for people to run if they didn't have a decent enough CPU.
[516.70 --> 517.70]  So maybe don't buy it.
[517.70 --> 518.70]  Yeah.
[518.70 --> 519.70]  So it should.
[519.70 --> 520.70]  And that's the issue.
[520.70 --> 521.70]  Maybe don't buy a damn game.
[521.70 --> 531.70]  And then there's been, was it Kerbal Space Program or something had a really weird EULA update that made it so that like, yeah, you probably shouldn't buy this game.
[531.70 --> 532.70]  Oh, wow.
[532.70 --> 536.70]  I don't, I don't, I could be super inflammatory saying Kerbal Space Program.
[536.70 --> 538.70]  Now I must know.
[538.70 --> 539.70]  EULA spyware.
[539.70 --> 540.70]  EULA.
[540.70 --> 542.70]  End user license agreement, guys.
[542.70 --> 545.70]  Kerbal Space Program's new EULA makes it spyware.
[545.70 --> 548.70]  Take two is not, da da da da da.
[548.70 --> 549.70]  Quite the headline.
[549.70 --> 550.70]  Yeah.
[550.70 --> 553.70]  I don't know very much about this to be completely clear.
[553.70 --> 564.70]  Um, and I think it's going to take quite a bit to dive into, but my stance is just going to be that EULA updates are very important.
[564.70 --> 565.70]  Okay.
[565.70 --> 569.70]  Um, and, and DRM stuff can be very important.
[569.70 --> 579.70]  I think, I think people review bombing every single, um, every single game that comes out that has DRM on it is like maybe a little excessive.
[579.70 --> 586.70]  But when people are like the DRM implementation in this game is ridiculous and extremely detrimental and we should probably all get very angry about this.
[586.70 --> 588.70]  I think that's very valid.
[588.70 --> 594.70]  Well, luckily for people like you and those who, uh, share your opinion, you can completely opt out of this.
[594.70 --> 595.70]  Oh.
[595.70 --> 596.70]  So, it's entirely opt out.
[596.70 --> 599.70]  Uh, so there's going to be a check box in, or I think it's there now.
[599.70 --> 607.70]  There is now a check box in your Steam store options where you can choose to have off topic review bombs still included in all the review scores you see.
[607.70 --> 608.70]  Sweet.
[608.70 --> 609.70]  Cool.
[609.70 --> 610.70]  Thank you for the option.
[610.70 --> 611.70]  Yeah, sounds good.
[611.70 --> 614.70]  So, we have a little bit more information about how they're doing this, what their process is.
[614.70 --> 621.70]  Basically, they made some kind of, uh, uh, automated tool that looks at the frequency of reviews.
[621.70 --> 627.70]  So, let's say a game came out, it's been out for two years, and suddenly it gets a huge number of reviews.
[627.70 --> 628.70]  Yeah.
[628.70 --> 629.70]  It'll get flagged.
[629.70 --> 630.70]  And that's all the tool does.
[630.70 --> 633.70]  The tool doesn't try to figure out why or at all.
[633.70 --> 636.70]  All it does is say, hey, look at this anonymous activity.
[636.70 --> 638.70]  And then a team of humans will then look at it.
[638.70 --> 639.70]  Okay.
[639.70 --> 640.70]  Okay.
[640.70 --> 643.70]  And then these people have already been trained at looking at, um, review bombs in the past,
[643.70 --> 644.70]  or off topic review bombs in the past.
[644.70 --> 645.70]  Yeah.
[645.70 --> 646.70]  So, they can determine.
[646.70 --> 648.70]  I mean, because there's review bombs that are normal.
[648.70 --> 649.70]  You know?
[649.70 --> 652.70]  Like, a lot of reviews because the game came out today.
[652.70 --> 653.70]  Yeah.
[653.70 --> 654.70]  And we all love it.
[654.70 --> 655.70]  Yeah.
[655.70 --> 656.70]  We all want everyone to buy Red Dead or something.
[656.70 --> 657.70]  Risk of Rain 2.
[660.70 --> 665.70]  Risk of Rain 2 was a game that had like almost no marketing and then got positively review bombed,
[665.70 --> 668.70]  if you want to call it that, because tons of people that played it thought it was amazing.
[668.70 --> 670.70]  And then it sold really well.
[670.70 --> 671.70]  It was great.
[671.70 --> 672.70]  Here's another little wrinkle.
[672.70 --> 677.70]  When they determine that this period of time represents an off topic review bomb,
[677.70 --> 685.70]  they don't have much sensitivity in saying which are going to stay and which are going to be deemed bad.
[685.70 --> 691.70]  So, it's like, okay, this weekend, this two day period, people were getting review bombed.
[691.70 --> 695.70]  We're going to remove all of those reviews from contributing to the review score.
[695.70 --> 696.70]  I made it.
[696.70 --> 700.70]  Well, even if you just legitimately happened to review that day and it was a genuine review,
[700.70 --> 705.70]  that's not about DRM or EULA or something that they think is off topic, your review is going to get discounted too.
[705.70 --> 707.70]  That's super bad in my opinion.
[707.70 --> 708.70]  Yes, it is.
[708.70 --> 712.70]  But I think it's a drop in the bucket for the overall score.
[712.70 --> 713.70]  Probably.
[713.70 --> 727.70]  But that's not, that nullifies major, not really because then if the, so that nullifies major EULA and DRM and whatever else they decide is off topic changes from being noticed by the general public.
[727.70 --> 734.70]  Because most people are not going to, I will, most people are not going to go into their settings and make it so that this thing doesn't apply to them.
[734.70 --> 740.70]  And most people, if, if the, let's assume the Kerbal Space Program thing is real.
[740.70 --> 741.70]  I don't know.
[741.70 --> 742.70]  I'd never looked into it too deeply.
[742.70 --> 744.70]  I just shared it to one of my friends that plays the game.
[744.70 --> 749.70]  Um, and I don't know, but let's assume that it's spyware now.
[749.70 --> 750.70]  I don't know.
[750.70 --> 759.70]  Um, I would, hypothetically, I would want to know that that EULA is technically, um, unrelated or whatever they called it.
[759.70 --> 765.70]  So the recent reviews would still show up as very positive, I believe, because I believe that's what Kerbal Space Program is.
[765.70 --> 768.70]  But the recent reviews when that came out made it very negative.
[768.70 --> 770.70]  The score, so the score would be positive.
[770.70 --> 771.70]  The recent.
[771.70 --> 773.70]  The written reviews would still be negative.
[773.70 --> 774.70]  Yeah.
[774.70 --> 775.70]  Yeah.
[775.70 --> 776.70]  But most people aren't going to scroll through the reviews.
[776.70 --> 778.70]  They're just going to go, oh, all time, very positive.
[778.70 --> 779.70]  Recent, very positive.
[779.70 --> 780.70]  Sounds good.
[780.70 --> 781.70]  Game looks interesting.
[781.70 --> 782.70]  Let's go.
[782.70 --> 783.70]  Oh, I think you misunderstand what I'm saying.
[783.70 --> 784.70]  Mm.
[784.70 --> 787.70]  What I'm saying is, uh, let's say everyone goes and bombs it.
[787.70 --> 788.70]  Yeah.
[788.70 --> 790.70]  And the score is unaltered because they deemed it off topic.
[790.70 --> 791.70]  Yeah.
[791.70 --> 795.70]  What I'm saying is if there happened to be a guy who came in and just gave a review during that same weekend,
[795.70 --> 797.70]  and was like, and doesn't know who the EULA.
[797.70 --> 798.70]  Oh no, I know, I know, I know.
[798.70 --> 804.70]  So what I'm saying with that is like, it will nullify any of this news, basically.
[804.70 --> 812.70]  Because, oh, no, yeah, I guess because that's, yeah, I know, I guess what I'm saying is pretty off.
[813.70 --> 814.70]  All right.
[814.70 --> 815.70]  Sounds good.
[815.70 --> 816.70]  I just, I guess.
[816.70 --> 817.70]  It's still valid.
[817.70 --> 818.70]  Yeah.
[818.70 --> 820.70]  I just, I don't like the idea that you're nullifying everything.
[820.70 --> 826.70]  Because it will make any major change that people like that isn't directly related to gameplay.
[826.70 --> 830.70]  Because I think that's effectively what they're saying is only gameplay things will ever get mentioned.
[830.70 --> 833.70]  Well, I, they're not explicitly saying that.
[833.70 --> 835.70]  That might be like de facto what it means.
[835.70 --> 839.70]  Yeah, it feels, I definitely, but it feels like that's what it's going to end up being.
[839.70 --> 845.70]  Um, any problem that is ever unrelated to gameplay, I'm assuming at this point, is just going to disappear.
[845.70 --> 851.70]  So you're saying, by saying that, I think you're indicating that the score is very important.
[851.70 --> 853.70]  That's the main thing you look at as a Steve user.
[853.70 --> 857.70]  I would assume it's the main thing that a lot of people look at.
[857.70 --> 859.70]  Because it's the main thing that's projected.
[859.70 --> 862.70]  You, when you go to a game on the store, let's, let's try this out.
[862.70 --> 863.70]  Let's look at risk of rain.
[863.70 --> 868.70]  That's actually the forecast for this weekend on Saturday.
[868.70 --> 869.70]  Okay.
[869.70 --> 872.70]  Uh, let's go to my screen.
[873.70 --> 874.70]  Risk of rain two.
[874.70 --> 876.70]  It doesn't have a recent because the game just freaking came out.
[876.70 --> 877.70]  So it makes sense.
[877.70 --> 879.70]  All reviews, overwhelmingly positive 10,000 reviews.
[879.70 --> 881.70]  I don't think most people are going to click on this.
[881.70 --> 884.70]  They're just going to see overwhelmingly positive and go, great.
[884.70 --> 887.70]  This game, this video that's auto-playing looks interesting.
[887.70 --> 888.70]  It's overwhelmingly positive.
[888.70 --> 889.70]  It's not a good one.
[889.70 --> 890.70]  It's not a good one.
[890.70 --> 891.70]  It's not a good one.
[891.70 --> 892.70]  It looks interesting.
[892.70 --> 894.70]  It's overwhelmingly positive.
[894.70 --> 895.70]  Maybe scroll down and see like...
[895.70 --> 896.70]  What do you have to do to get through?
[896.70 --> 897.70]  You just scroll down?
[897.70 --> 899.70]  A couple of my friends, play it, whatever.
[899.70 --> 900.70]  I think you have to go pretty far.
[900.70 --> 902.70]  Recent updates about the game.
[902.70 --> 903.70]  Key features.
[903.70 --> 904.70]  System requirements.
[904.70 --> 905.70]  More like this.
[905.70 --> 906.70]  What Curator Say.
[906.70 --> 907.70]  Reviews down here.
[907.70 --> 910.70]  I don't think most people are reading reviews.
[910.70 --> 911.70]  They're, they're super buried.
[911.70 --> 912.70]  I think you can get there.
[912.70 --> 913.70]  Straw poll?
[913.70 --> 914.70]  Sweet.
[914.70 --> 915.70]  Straw poll.
[915.70 --> 918.70]  This is going to be so, before we do this straw poll,
[918.70 --> 921.70]  I'm going to say this is going to be one of the more skewed straw polls that we have.
[921.70 --> 926.98]  because we're gonna have a whole bunch of power users but if it says a whole
[926.98 --> 930.46]  bunch of power users are not reading reviews I'm pushing back on that because
[930.46 --> 933.32]  I don't think you need to be a power user to read reviews because I think we
[933.32 --> 938.76]  have such an e-commerce culture now I always read the views on Amazon I'm used
[938.76 --> 941.74]  to scrolling all the way to the bottom of an Amazon page to get to the reviews
[941.74 --> 946.54]  that's a good point because usually I read all the negative reviews on Amazon
[946.54 --> 950.26]  or I'll read the run the one stars like you're making a purchasing decision here
[950.26 --> 954.28]  I'm gonna read a couple read the top yeah top positive top negative yeah let's
[954.28 --> 962.50]  see in a straw poll I think you're right on that one okay do you read steam in all
[962.50 --> 968.20]  capitals before when you're when you're interested in buying like before you buy
[968.20 --> 974.38]  do you read a couple reviews or do you just use the overall score yeah I'm doing
[974.38 --> 979.12]  like a little side test thing oh I'm interested so we're doing yes no and no
[979.12 --> 984.76]  but I do on Amazon because that's my that's you and I'm wondering if I'm
[984.76 --> 991.54]  weird or if that's you're definitely weird yeah but like I wonder how much
[991.54 --> 999.22]  because it did do you read reviews for games on Steam ah well like if you've
[999.22 --> 1002.68]  already heard of a game and that's why you're there then you don't really need
[1002.68 --> 1006.30]  to read the reviews but that's that's kind of what I'm talking really depends on
[1006.30 --> 1010.08]  how many people are just browsing when they're like I want to buy a game and I'm
[1010.08 --> 1015.54]  just gonna browse the store and just find something it seems like usually it's
[1015.54 --> 1018.72]  word-of-mouth like people you know who you game with are playing that kind of
[1018.72 --> 1022.38]  game I browse quite a bit sometimes you do word-of-mouth if I get word-of-mouth
[1022.38 --> 1027.54]  about a product that's on Amazon though I still very often read the reviews if I
[1027.54 --> 1032.76]  get word-of-mouth about a game on Steam I'll check the positive negative thing
[1032.76 --> 1037.38]  because I want to know if something recent did something bad to it because
[1037.38 --> 1040.20]  someone might have played a game like Kerbal Space Program for example
[1040.20 --> 1043.62]  hypothetically so I might have played it and enjoyed it for like a year and then
[1043.62 --> 1047.04]  this Eula thing comes out I don't want to spyware game so yeah they don't
[1047.04 --> 1049.44]  necessarily know that because they've just been playing they're not checking the
[1049.44 --> 1053.22]  store page there's one play the game so that I would be nice for me to know and
[1053.22 --> 1056.60]  I just do a little quick check and then move on I wonder I'd like to see the
[1056.60 --> 1062.52]  stats on how many people straight up opt out of this yes that would be really put that in your
[1062.52 --> 1064.90]  next hardware survey even though it's not hardware
[1064.90 --> 1069.84]  chuck it in there how long do we have to wait before we can look at this
[1069.84 --> 1073.82]  poll results I want to post it in the YouTube chat really quick
[1073.82 --> 1080.76]  I'm trying to get there oh there's so many interesting questions
[1080.76 --> 1086.70]  how do people get new games because you're right like a lot there's especially in
[1086.70 --> 1090.78]  the indie space there's so many games that don't have a lot of marketing but then
[1090.78 --> 1094.80]  you get buzz in other ways like Apex Legends obviously they had influencer
[1094.80 --> 1098.10]  marketing but then they do they had millions of dollars in influencer
[1098.10 --> 1102.98]  marketing yeah but a lot of people heard about it from other people getting
[1102.98 --> 1105.70]  it popular like I heard about it like on a Monday when it was like over the
[1105.70 --> 1108.04]  weekend two million people started playing this game
[1108.04 --> 1112.80]  but that I think was a lot of influencer marketing and then people seeing the
[1112.80 --> 1114.56]  influencers and then friends telling each other
[1114.56 --> 1123.28]  it just wasn't spammed in ads here wait let's see the okay results do you read
[1123.28 --> 1127.16]  steam game reviews two-thirds of people say yes buzz in other ways like Apex
[1127.16 --> 1131.06]  almost a quarter of people said no but I do on Amazon marketing and only 12% of
[1131.06 --> 1134.44]  people said millions of dollars in influencer marketing so I guess 35% of people
[1134.44 --> 1139.14]  heard about it from other people I'm surprised I'm getting popular like I heard about it on a
[1139.14 --> 1142.32]  Monday when it was like over the weekend two million people started playing this
[1142.32 --> 1146.46]  game majority of the time I don't but that I think if a game is all the time
[1146.46 --> 1150.30]  and then people seeing the influencers and then friends telling each other I'm not too worried about
[1150.30 --> 1156.78]  it just wasn't spamming ads if a game is like has a weird disparity results overwhelming
[1156.78 --> 1163.74]  do you read steam game reviews two-thirds of people said no but I don't have a
[1163.74 --> 1170.04]  have a trailer do you read I'm from the game other people have surprised not
[1170.04 --> 1176.50]  surprised get again off it in feeling like outstanding old game it's going to be
[1176.50 --> 1182.16]  kingdoms game risk of rain is more even it was a game is is blowing it was like
[1182.16 --> 1186.24]  alright feels like records thing buildonnable just wasn't showing you only
[1186.24 --> 1191.52]  20 bucks in a new game is like I'm on your Dan's beer and all he possibly 요
[1191.52 --> 1192.14]  I don't know.
[1192.14 --> 1193.52]  Do you read Steam game reviews?
[1193.52 --> 1193.98]  It's like any game.
[1193.98 --> 1194.52]  What the hell?
[1194.52 --> 1195.02]  Yeah.
[1195.02 --> 1198.52]  If there's an interest in the story for an opener,
[1198.52 --> 1201.52]  but if it's a game that isn't free, it's $60 or $80.
[1201.52 --> 1203.52]  So I guess we don't share it.
[1203.52 --> 1205.52]  But a lot of people think the price from the game
[1205.52 --> 1207.52]  other people have this, right?
[1207.52 --> 1209.52]  It's like a half-dollar game, you're like,
[1209.52 --> 1210.52]  okay, what's going down?
[1210.52 --> 1212.52]  Too many people started playing this game.
[1212.52 --> 1213.52]  Risk of Rain is more indie.
[1213.52 --> 1214.52]  Oh, no!
[1214.52 --> 1216.52]  I think if a game is all the time,
[1216.52 --> 1219.52]  it's like, oh my god, it's so bad.
[1219.52 --> 1222.52]  Did that fix it?
[1222.52 --> 1225.52]  Hello?
[1225.52 --> 1228.52]  Did that fix it?
[1228.52 --> 1231.52]  We're having a technical difficulty here.
[1231.52 --> 1234.52]  How do you even do this?
[1234.52 --> 1235.52]  Is it this?
[1235.52 --> 1236.52]  It shouldn't be this.
[1236.52 --> 1237.52]  You're good now.
[1237.52 --> 1238.52]  Oh, we're good now.
[1238.52 --> 1239.52]  Okay.
[1239.52 --> 1240.52]  Was it this?
[1240.52 --> 1241.52]  It was Twitch over here.
[1241.52 --> 1242.52]  Apparently we were getting an echo though.
[1242.52 --> 1243.52]  It didn't happen last time, which is weird.
[1243.52 --> 1244.52]  But I'm using my laptop now.
[1244.52 --> 1245.52]  Horrendous.
[1245.52 --> 1246.52]  You should just mute it on this side.
[1246.52 --> 1248.52]  Just mute the Blackmagic device.
[1248.52 --> 1249.52]  It's minimumed.
[1249.52 --> 1250.52]  It is.
[1250.52 --> 1251.52]  Oh, okay, cool.
[1251.52 --> 1252.52]  Minimumed?
[1252.52 --> 1253.52]  Minimum.
[1253.52 --> 1254.52]  Oh, it's not.
[1254.52 --> 1255.52]  Are you sure it's Blackmagic?
[1255.52 --> 1257.52]  Did you take the other cards out?
[1257.52 --> 1260.52]  Well then, I don't know.
[1260.52 --> 1263.52]  I think that's time to move to the next topic here.
[1263.52 --> 1265.52]  But yeah, it shouldn't take audio from there.
[1265.52 --> 1267.52]  Anyways, yeah, let's move on.
[1267.52 --> 1269.52]  Facebook patent.
[1269.52 --> 1272.52]  Thank you, Flowplane Chat, for letting me know that was going on.
[1272.52 --> 1277.52]  A new Facebook patent reveals that Facebook is even more out of touch than you could have ever imagined.
[1277.52 --> 1278.52]  Yeah, oh my god.
[1278.52 --> 1280.52]  Would you like to read us?
[1280.52 --> 1281.52]  Read us in?
[1281.52 --> 1286.52]  So basically, what's going on here is they're going to have an AI thingamajiggy.
[1286.52 --> 1287.52]  Wait, hold on.
[1287.52 --> 1288.52]  It's a patent.
[1288.52 --> 1289.52]  It's a patent.
[1289.52 --> 1290.52]  So first of all...
[1290.52 --> 1291.52]  That's fair.
[1291.52 --> 1292.52]  They're not doing it right now.
[1292.52 --> 1293.52]  They're not doing it right now.
[1293.52 --> 1294.52]  Yeah.
[1294.52 --> 1295.52]  That's a good...
[1295.52 --> 1297.52]  That's a very good point.
[1297.52 --> 1306.52]  But the idea is they could look through profile photos on Facebook and look for photos where
[1306.52 --> 1311.52]  someone is prominently holding a product like a Coke can or a...
[1311.52 --> 1312.52]  Doritos bag.
[1312.52 --> 1313.52]  Doritos bag.
[1313.52 --> 1317.52]  Doritos bag or whatever else where you can clearly see the product.
[1317.52 --> 1319.52]  And then they would be able to use those photos.
[1319.52 --> 1321.52]  They would be able to license those photos.
[1321.52 --> 1323.52]  Not to you, by the way.
[1323.52 --> 1325.52]  But they would be able to license those photos for ads on Facebook.
[1325.52 --> 1330.52]  So they would use machine learning algorithms to identify these photos.
[1330.52 --> 1331.52]  I think they already do have...
[1331.52 --> 1335.52]  Which would probably not be that hard because you just look for a logo.
[1335.52 --> 1338.52]  And they'll train with certain domains first.
[1338.52 --> 1342.52]  Like a can, like snacks and stuff seems pretty easy to start with.
[1342.52 --> 1343.52]  Clothing would be way harder.
[1343.52 --> 1344.52]  A little bit harder.
[1344.52 --> 1345.52]  They'll maybe do that later.
[1345.52 --> 1346.52]  But they'll recognize these photos.
[1346.52 --> 1347.52]  They'll identify them.
[1347.52 --> 1353.52]  And then they'll pitch certain clients like, hey, Coca-Cola, here's a bunch of photos of
[1353.52 --> 1355.52]  people holding your product.
[1355.52 --> 1360.52]  Coca-Cola would then use those photos as ads that...
[1360.52 --> 1362.52]  And here's where I'm not clear.
[1362.52 --> 1366.52]  Would an ad of me holding a Coke can go only to me and my friends?
[1366.52 --> 1368.52]  Or would it go to the whole Facebook network?
[1368.52 --> 1374.52]  What we have written here is from the article.
[1374.52 --> 1380.52]  The patent filing suggests that the adverts would only be targeted to a person's Facebook friends
[1380.52 --> 1384.52]  if the user had limited their privacy settings that way.
[1384.52 --> 1390.52]  That language from that article anyway suggests that the default would be that it goes to everybody.
[1390.52 --> 1394.52]  If your privacy settings are public, I think it would go to everybody.
[1394.52 --> 1396.52]  I don't think... I don't really think that makes any sense.
[1396.52 --> 1397.52]  I don't think they would do that.
[1397.52 --> 1398.52]  It doesn't make sense.
[1398.52 --> 1404.52]  But if they found a particularly good one, like a fairly professional photo, they might decide to do it.
[1404.52 --> 1405.52]  And you're a babe? Yeah, they might.
[1405.52 --> 1406.52]  Yeah.
[1406.52 --> 1407.52]  Yeah.
[1407.52 --> 1408.52]  I don't know.
[1408.52 --> 1409.52]  Seems weird.
[1409.52 --> 1414.52]  I actually do see the business sense as creepy as it is and how we're all mad right now.
[1414.52 --> 1417.52]  I could see why they would pitch this as a product.
[1417.52 --> 1422.52]  Yeah, I mean, cold, completely blind to civilization business man.
[1422.52 --> 1425.52]  I completely get it as well because you're showing someone their friends...
[1425.52 --> 1426.52]  That's cool.
[1426.52 --> 1428.52]  Consuming or using a product.
[1428.52 --> 1432.52]  That's what advertising has always been, like associating the brand with something you like.
[1432.52 --> 1434.52]  You're like forcing word of mouth.
[1434.52 --> 1437.52]  The safe bet was always like, okay, use George Clooney.
[1437.52 --> 1439.52]  Use someone we all like.
[1439.52 --> 1444.52]  But now because it's so personal, we can say, hey, I happen to know your friends with this person.
[1444.52 --> 1447.52]  How about I just show you them or even yourself?
[1447.52 --> 1451.52]  Like, hey, remember a year ago when you had all that fun eating those cheesies?
[1451.52 --> 1452.52]  Get cheesies again, man.
[1452.52 --> 1453.52]  That was a good night.
[1453.52 --> 1454.52]  That was a good night.
[1454.52 --> 1461.52]  I really hope that this goes poorly and there's like someone doing something bad with a product.
[1461.52 --> 1462.52]  This is exactly what I think.
[1462.52 --> 1465.52]  Like, oh, look at someone drinking Grey Goose.
[1465.52 --> 1467.52]  That's my alcoholic friend.
[1467.52 --> 1468.52]  Yeah.
[1468.52 --> 1469.52]  That guy's not okay.
[1469.52 --> 1470.52]  He's in rehab.
[1470.52 --> 1471.52]  Yeah.
[1471.52 --> 1474.52]  Like, totally shoot yourself in the foot.
[1474.52 --> 1475.52]  How are they gonna know?
[1475.52 --> 1476.52]  There's no way for them to know.
[1476.52 --> 1484.52]  I really, yeah, I really, I really hope that if this does get put in place, which I hope
[1484.52 --> 1489.52]  it doesn't, but if it does, I really hope it goes sideways in like glorious ways.
[1489.52 --> 1495.52]  I don't see how they could ever really implement this because the optics are so bad and then
[1495.52 --> 1496.52]  that's obvious.
[1496.52 --> 1498.52]  That's an obvious downside.
[1498.52 --> 1500.52]  It could easily happen.
[1500.52 --> 1501.52]  It could easily happen.
[1501.52 --> 1505.52]  And like you see the amount of times that like, what was that Microsoft AI that people
[1505.52 --> 1506.52]  like made racist?
[1506.52 --> 1507.52]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1507.52 --> 1510.52]  Because it like learned from the people and then they like pushed it.
[1510.52 --> 1511.52]  Yeah, yeah.
[1511.52 --> 1514.52]  So like people are, people love messing with this kind of stuff.
[1514.52 --> 1518.52]  Yeah, I'll just upload pictures of me holding Doritos bag and like holding it by my crotch.
[1518.52 --> 1519.52]  Yeah.
[1519.52 --> 1523.52]  But that won't affect it though because remember Facebook identifies it algorithmically and then
[1523.52 --> 1525.52]  hands it to the brand.
[1525.52 --> 1526.52]  Oh.
[1526.52 --> 1527.52]  So people are gonna see it.
[1527.52 --> 1528.52]  So you can't just troll like that.
[1528.52 --> 1530.52]  Unless it's a brand that likes that.
[1530.52 --> 1533.52]  If it's like a weird brand, like it's D brand or something and I'm wearing only D brand,
[1533.52 --> 1535.52]  they might actually like that.
[1535.52 --> 1537.52]  D brand would be like, heck yeah.
[1537.52 --> 1539.52]  D brand's hilarious.
[1539.52 --> 1540.52]  I don't know.
[1540.52 --> 1541.52]  This is spooky.
[1541.52 --> 1544.52]  So I looked into whether or not, remember a few years ago, this was actually a few years
[1544.52 --> 1547.52]  ago, like back when I was in university, maybe almost a decade ago.
[1547.52 --> 1548.52]  We're so old.
[1548.52 --> 1551.52]  There was a bunch of stuff going around that was like, did you know that you don't own your
[1551.52 --> 1552.52]  photos on Facebook?
[1552.52 --> 1553.52]  Yeah.
[1553.52 --> 1554.52]  Facebook owns your photos.
[1554.52 --> 1558.52]  So I looked into it and at least, I believe this is source two here.
[1558.52 --> 1561.52]  An article from 2017 said, you know, you in fact do own your photos.
[1561.52 --> 1562.52]  You own them.
[1562.52 --> 1565.52]  And if you take them away, Facebook can't use them anymore.
[1565.52 --> 1567.52]  But they can use them while they're on the platform, right?
[1567.52 --> 1568.52]  Correct.
[1568.52 --> 1573.52]  When they're on the platform, Facebook has total license to do stuff with them, including
[1573.52 --> 1577.52]  sub-licensing them to say Pepsi Cola or whatever.
[1577.52 --> 1583.52]  So start deleting the ones you don't, all the times you were photographed holding Doritos
[1583.52 --> 1585.52]  or something, just delete them if you don't want this to happen.
[1585.52 --> 1586.52]  Yeah.
[1586.52 --> 1587.52]  Yeah.
[1587.52 --> 1589.52]  Or just stop really using Facebook.
[1589.52 --> 1591.52]  Delete Facebook.
[1591.52 --> 1592.52]  Nice.
[1592.52 --> 1593.52]  Heck yeah.
[1593.52 --> 1596.52]  It's so useful in other ways.
[1596.52 --> 1600.52]  Basically, the only reason why I have it is getting in contact with people that are
[1600.52 --> 1602.52]  sometimes very hard to get in contact with.
[1602.52 --> 1603.52]  Yeah.
[1603.52 --> 1605.52]  Because phone books aren't like really a thing anymore.
[1605.52 --> 1608.52]  Facebook's the yellow pages.
[1608.52 --> 1609.52]  Yep.
[1609.52 --> 1611.52]  It's really good for those weak ties.
[1611.52 --> 1612.52]  Yeah.
[1612.52 --> 1613.52]  I don't have your number.
[1613.52 --> 1615.52]  Really friends, I've met you.
[1615.52 --> 1616.52]  You're useful now.
[1616.52 --> 1617.52]  Yeah.
[1617.52 --> 1618.52]  I want to get in touch.
[1618.52 --> 1619.52]  Here's a message.
[1619.52 --> 1622.52]  Um, speaking of, uh...
[1622.52 --> 1623.52]  Are we at half time?
[1623.52 --> 1624.52]  Should we, uh...
[1624.52 --> 1625.52]  Are we?
[1625.52 --> 1626.52]  We are, pretty much.
[1626.52 --> 1627.52]  We can do the thing.
[1627.52 --> 1629.52]  Uh, I don't know what I'm leaning back to do.
[1629.52 --> 1630.52]  Squarespace!
[1630.52 --> 1631.52]  Let's do that.
[1631.52 --> 1633.52]  I'll also lean back.
[1633.52 --> 1636.52]  Part way through I was just like, where am I going?
[1636.52 --> 1637.52]  I'd have no idea.
[1637.52 --> 1641.52]  Uh, Squarespace gives you the tools you need to build and grow your online presence.
[1641.52 --> 1646.52]  So you could make a really cool website with all your information on it, instead of a Facebook page.
[1646.52 --> 1649.52]  Uh, they've got tons of templates spanning a large variety of categories.
[1649.52 --> 1651.52]  Do you need a website or a blog?
[1651.52 --> 1653.52]  How about your wedding or a business?
[1653.52 --> 1655.52]  Um, Squarespace has you covered.
[1655.52 --> 1660.52]  There are actually, I know quite a few couples that have spun up Squarespace websites for the wedding.
[1660.52 --> 1661.52]  Super fast.
[1661.52 --> 1662.52]  Yep.
[1662.52 --> 1663.52]  Really easy.
[1663.52 --> 1669.52]  Get started with a free 14 day trial and head to squarespace.com forward slash WAN to get 10% off your first purchase.
[1669.52 --> 1671.52]  You can see it down, down here.
[1671.52 --> 1677.52]  You get a domain quickly through Squarespace if you need one or port over an existing domain that you already own.
[1677.52 --> 1684.52]  Um, and I believe, this isn't in the notes right here, but I do believe if you sign up for a year, that domain gets thrown in.
[1684.52 --> 1686.52]  Yeah, you usually get a free one.
[1686.52 --> 1687.52]  Yeah.
[1687.52 --> 1688.52]  In my experience with them, you would.
[1688.52 --> 1689.52]  Yeah.
[1689.52 --> 1690.52]  Yeah.
[1690.52 --> 1694.52]  I think you have to sign up for a year because buying a domain generally lasts for a minimum of a year at a time, so that makes sense.
[1694.52 --> 1697.52]  Um, but, yeah.
[1697.52 --> 1700.52]  Moving onwards, we have Displate.
[1700.52 --> 1701.52]  Displate?
[1701.52 --> 1702.52]  Displate?
[1702.52 --> 1703.52]  Displate right here.
[1703.52 --> 1704.52]  This one?
[1704.52 --> 1705.52]  This one?
[1705.52 --> 1706.52]  Uh, Displate is a magnet mounted metal print.
[1706.52 --> 1707.52]  Pull it off there.
[1707.52 --> 1708.52]  Woo!
[1708.52 --> 1709.52]  See you later.
[1709.52 --> 1710.52]  Goodbye.
[1710.52 --> 1712.52]  And then you could be like, no.
[1712.52 --> 1714.52]  Vancouver's upside down.
[1714.52 --> 1715.52]  Whoa, the upside down.
[1715.52 --> 1717.52]  What do you think about that?
[1717.52 --> 1718.52]  It's abstract.
[1718.52 --> 1719.52]  Or, utilities.
[1719.52 --> 1720.52]  Need to bludgeon?
[1720.52 --> 1721.52]  Have a fan.
[1721.52 --> 1723.52]  Whatever you need.
[1723.52 --> 1726.52]  Use the corner of it to really cut into something.
[1726.52 --> 1727.52]  Heck yeah.
[1727.52 --> 1730.52]  They're durable, as you probably just saw.
[1730.52 --> 1733.52]  You don't need any power tools to hang it, clearly, which is cool.
[1733.52 --> 1739.52]  There's over 260,000 different arts spanning a bunch of different styles and influences.
[1739.52 --> 1744.52]  With their easy metal, uh, with their easy magnet mounting, there are no holes in the wall, and
[1744.52 --> 1745.52]  it's replaceable.
[1745.52 --> 1747.52]  I'm really trying to serve the OCD people out there.
[1747.52 --> 1748.52]  This is gonna bother people.
[1748.52 --> 1749.52]  Yeah, yeah.
[1749.52 --> 1750.52]  Probably me.
[1750.52 --> 1757.52]  Speaking of that though, if you were going to, if you hung it originally like that, unlike
[1757.52 --> 1760.52]  a lot of things, you can just turn it back.
[1760.52 --> 1762.52]  I'm gonna try to also do a good job.
[1762.52 --> 1763.52]  Good luck, pal.
[1763.52 --> 1767.52]  But like, you can make sure it's correct after the fact, which is pretty cool.
[1767.52 --> 1770.52]  They also plant 10 trees for each display purchased.
[1770.52 --> 1772.52]  Whoa, that's a lot of trees per display.
[1772.52 --> 1773.52]  That's quite a few trees.
[1773.52 --> 1774.52]  Whoa.
[1774.52 --> 1775.52]  Yeah.
[1775.52 --> 1776.52]  Didn't know that one.
[1776.52 --> 1780.52]  Uh, head to our link below and use offer code LTT to save 15% today.
[1780.52 --> 1781.52]  There you go.
[1781.52 --> 1782.52]  Offer code down here.
[1782.52 --> 1783.52]  15.
[1783.52 --> 1784.52]  Not bad.
[1784.52 --> 1787.52]  Plant 10 trees and buy a thing for your wall.
[1787.52 --> 1789.52]  And save 15% while doing it.
[1789.52 --> 1790.52]  Heck yeah.
[1790.52 --> 1793.52]  And, pia.
[1793.52 --> 1796.52]  We got a new domain thing, which is cool.
[1796.52 --> 1798.52]  LMG.DG slash PIAWAN.
[1798.52 --> 1800.52]  Instead of the crazy long thing it was before.
[1800.52 --> 1801.52]  Piawan.
[1801.52 --> 1802.52]  Piawan.
[1802.52 --> 1804.52]  That sounds like an island in the Philippines.
[1804.52 --> 1807.52]  That'd be cool if it was.
[1807.52 --> 1812.52]  Private Internet Access supports a variety of VPN protocols and types of encryption and
[1812.52 --> 1817.52]  authentication, allowing you to dial in the exact level of privacy protection you need, which
[1817.52 --> 1818.52]  is cool.
[1818.52 --> 1824.52]  It has apps for Windows, Mac OS, Android, iOS, it still says Linus, but Linux, Google Chrome,
[1824.52 --> 1826.52]  and support for several other platforms coming soon.
[1826.52 --> 1829.52]  You connect up to five devices at the same time.
[1829.52 --> 1833.52]  Apps include DNS leak protection and IPv6 leak protection.
[1833.52 --> 1835.52]  This one is my favorite part.
[1835.52 --> 1840.52]  Actually, the internet kill switch will block all traffic if the VPN becomes disconnected
[1840.52 --> 1841.52]  unexpectedly.
[1841.52 --> 1849.52]  So you don't have to worry about a security hole if something happens with PIA or something
[1849.52 --> 1854.52]  happens between you and PIA, so your connection to them is faulty for a second.
[1854.52 --> 1856.52]  No data will go through.
[1856.52 --> 1859.52]  So there will be no data that is unencrypted, which is pretty neato.
[1859.52 --> 1864.52]  Check it out today at lmg.com slash PIAwan.
[1864.52 --> 1865.52]  Or Piawan.
[1865.52 --> 1866.52]  Piawan.
[1866.52 --> 1867.52]  Piawan.
[1867.52 --> 1868.52]  Piawan.
[1868.52 --> 1873.52]  The emphasis matters whether you're talking with the island or the people that live there.
[1873.52 --> 1874.52]  Piawan.
[1874.52 --> 1876.52]  This is a very niche Philippines joke here.
[1876.52 --> 1877.52]  Piawan.
[1877.52 --> 1878.52]  Piawan.
[1878.52 --> 1879.52]  Piawan.
[1879.52 --> 1880.52]  Piawan.
[1880.52 --> 1882.52]  Speaking of not niche, I don't know.
[1882.52 --> 1886.52]  Amazon workers are listening in on Echo Audio, report says.
[1886.52 --> 1887.52]  Oh.
[1887.52 --> 1890.52]  People are mad and I don't know why.
[1890.52 --> 1891.52]  It's lmg.gg.
[1891.52 --> 1892.52]  What did I say?
[1892.52 --> 1893.52]  Lmg.gg.com.
[1893.52 --> 1894.52]  Piawan.
[1894.52 --> 1895.52]  Piawan.
[1895.52 --> 1896.52]  Piawan.
[1896.52 --> 1897.52]  Piawan.
[1897.52 --> 1898.52]  Piawan.
[1898.52 --> 1899.52]  Piawan.
[1899.52 --> 1900.52]  Piawan.
[1900.52 --> 1901.52]  Piawan.
[1901.52 --> 1902.52]  Piawan.
[1902.52 --> 1903.52]  Piawan.
[1903.52 --> 1906.52]  Apparently it's lmg.gg and I said com.
[1906.52 --> 1907.52]  Sorry about that.
[1907.52 --> 1909.52]  See my website is cool and has a .com.
[1909.52 --> 1910.52]  Fullplane.com.
[1910.52 --> 1911.52]  Go subscribe.
[1911.52 --> 1912.52]  Heck yeah.
[1912.52 --> 1914.52]  Anyways, Amazon workers are listening to What You Tell Alexa.
[1914.52 --> 1915.52]  What did you say?
[1915.52 --> 1917.52]  You're wondering why people are mad?
[1917.52 --> 1918.52]  Yeah.
[1918.52 --> 1919.52]  Well, let's talk about it.
[1919.52 --> 1920.52]  Yeah.
[1920.52 --> 1921.52]  Bloomberg reports.
[1921.52 --> 1925.52]  Okay, first of all, Bloomberg lately, I think they've eroded their trust.
[1925.52 --> 1928.52]  You know who's been way more off the board than Bloomberg, in my opinion?
[1928.52 --> 1929.52]  Forbes.
[1929.52 --> 1930.52]  Oh.
[1930.52 --> 1931.52]  I don't know.
[1931.52 --> 1932.52]  It's weird stuff.
[1932.52 --> 1933.52]  I'm not talking about weird topics.
[1933.52 --> 1937.52]  I'm talking about trust because it started with that report they made about the-
[1937.52 --> 1938.52]  Sorry, Forbes.
[1938.52 --> 1939.52]  I don't know anything about it.
[1939.52 --> 1940.52]  The Chinese microtrip spying.
[1940.52 --> 1941.52]  Yeah.
[1941.52 --> 1942.52]  That's weird.
[1942.52 --> 1943.52]  A lot of people were like, I don't know.
[1943.52 --> 1944.52]  Doesn't sound credible.
[1944.52 --> 1947.52]  And then from there, oh, they had a recent one.
[1947.52 --> 1948.52]  And now this, anyway.
[1948.52 --> 1949.52]  Bloomberg reports-
[1949.52 --> 1950.52]  Yeah, I don't think Forbes is necessarily non-credible.
[1950.52 --> 1952.52]  They just do weird stuff now.
[1952.52 --> 1959.52]  Bloomberg reports Amazon tasks outside contractors as well as full-time Amazon employees to comb
[1959.52 --> 1967.52]  through snippets of audio from Echo devices to help train A-L-E-X-A, the company's voice-enabled
[1967.52 --> 1968.52]  assistant.
[1968.52 --> 1973.52]  The clips include both explicit commands and background conversations.
[1973.52 --> 1977.52]  Presumably background conversations that are caught happening after you say the hot
[1977.52 --> 1978.52]  word.
[1978.52 --> 1980.52]  Probably kind of whenever.
[1980.52 --> 1981.52]  Just whenever?
[1981.52 --> 1982.52]  Yeah.
[1982.52 --> 1983.52]  What?
[1983.52 --> 1984.52]  Why not?
[1984.52 --> 1985.52]  What do you mean why not?
[1985.52 --> 1987.52]  There's nothing that stops them from doing it whenever.
[1987.52 --> 1991.52]  Well, it's not supposed to connect to the servers until you say the hot word.
[1991.52 --> 1992.52]  Sure.
[1992.52 --> 1995.52]  I'm sure they could do it absolutely whenever.
[1995.52 --> 1997.52]  And they're trying to train it to be better, right?
[1997.52 --> 1999.52]  So they could be trying to train it to pick up the word.
[1999.52 --> 2002.52]  The thing is, I don't think they have to.
[2002.52 --> 2006.52]  I don't think- okay, I hear what you're saying there.
[2006.52 --> 2011.52]  Like, what if someone says the hot word, but then they want to hear 10 seconds before
[2011.52 --> 2014.52]  that to see if it took that person 20 tries?
[2014.52 --> 2017.52]  And then they can learn, oh, okay, you're Scottish and this is how you say it.
[2017.52 --> 2018.52]  You're weirdo.
[2018.52 --> 2021.52]  Or if someone was trying to say it and failed and gave up-
[2021.52 --> 2022.52]  This is what I'm saying.
[2022.52 --> 2026.52]  And then just Googled it or whatever and didn't use the device.
[2026.52 --> 2028.52]  So maybe it never went through.
[2028.52 --> 2030.52]  Maybe they never heard the hot word.
[2030.52 --> 2032.52]  How would they know that someone tried?
[2032.52 --> 2033.52]  By listening to everything.
[2033.52 --> 2034.52]  Oh, okay.
[2034.52 --> 2035.52]  You're a little tinfoil, Hattie.
[2035.52 --> 2036.52]  I think they don't have to-
[2036.52 --> 2037.52]  I think they could-
[2037.52 --> 2039.52]  Because there's so many commands every day.
[2039.52 --> 2044.52]  But you could go with false matches that are fairly high percentage.
[2044.52 --> 2045.52]  Yeah, okay.
[2045.52 --> 2050.52]  So like, they think you might have tried, but it wasn't good enough for them to actually activate.
[2050.52 --> 2053.52]  They could still listen to those periods of time.
[2053.52 --> 2060.52]  They wouldn't be able to identify those because it's only going to connect to the service and it will only record when you actually did make a match.
[2060.52 --> 2063.52]  Is that 100% true?
[2063.52 --> 2066.52]  Are you sure it only records when you fully make a match?
[2066.52 --> 2067.52]  Yeah.
[2067.52 --> 2073.52]  Like if you say, like, hi, Boogle, then it's like, nope.
[2073.52 --> 2077.52]  Like I have my Google Home set to go, ba-dink, after I say it.
[2077.52 --> 2078.52]  Yeah.
[2078.52 --> 2081.52]  And there are times where I'm watching a movie and someone just says something totally un-
[2081.52 --> 2083.52]  They'll say like, yes, please.
[2083.52 --> 2086.52]  But they say it in a way that sounds like the hot word.
[2086.52 --> 2089.52]  And it'll go, ba-dink, when I'm just watching a movie.
[2089.52 --> 2094.52]  Because I know, probably not right now, someone in chat is like, hi, Boogle.
[2094.52 --> 2101.52]  I know probably not right now, but for quite a while there, the biggest concern was it not detecting when people were trying.
[2101.52 --> 2106.52]  So I would expect them to try to find the ways that people were saying it when it wasn't working.
[2106.52 --> 2107.52]  Yeah.
[2107.52 --> 2114.52]  And they could have a thing where maybe it detects that you're trying, but it doesn't think it's close enough.
[2114.52 --> 2117.52]  So it records the audio, but it doesn't do a command.
[2117.52 --> 2118.52]  Yeah.
[2118.52 --> 2119.52]  It could happen.
[2119.52 --> 2124.52]  Like I'm not saying they're gonna, I'm not, they record every single word anyone ever says anywhere near them.
[2124.52 --> 2126.52]  And they might, but I kind of doubt it.
[2126.52 --> 2129.52]  But from an engineer perspective, it's like, hey, these are the weak points.
[2129.52 --> 2130.52]  Yeah.
[2130.52 --> 2132.52]  And you would want to learn how to improve that.
[2132.52 --> 2133.52]  Yeah.
[2133.52 --> 2137.52]  So I could definitely see them passing through recorded audio and being like, what was this?
[2137.52 --> 2139.52]  Was this supposed to be an accurate match?
[2139.52 --> 2143.52]  Was, did our system rate it maybe a little too highly?
[2143.52 --> 2146.52]  Was it someone on a TV show saying something completely unrelated?
[2146.52 --> 2151.52]  Another related issue to that was, I mean, we haven't really even explained the whole story yet.
[2151.52 --> 2153.52]  You get it though.
[2153.52 --> 2158.52]  There's, they want to train this machine to do a better job and surprise, they're using humans to do that.
[2158.52 --> 2165.52]  You thought maybe they were just putting more computers on it, but obviously humans are really good at speaking.
[2165.52 --> 2174.52]  So if you want to train this thing to speak better, you just take the snippets that are, you're giving the machine and let humans annotate to tell the machine how to do it better.
[2174.52 --> 2180.52]  It's pretty obvious they're using humans, but I guess no one, Amazon never explicitly said they're doing that.
[2180.52 --> 2189.52]  On their website, it says that user requests are applied to train our speech recognition and natural language understanding systems.
[2189.52 --> 2192.52]  It doesn't say with humans, but it also doesn't not say that.
[2192.52 --> 2196.52]  So I think if you think about it for a bit, you would assume that they're using humans.
[2196.52 --> 2197.52]  Yeah, no, I'm not surprised at all.
[2197.52 --> 2199.52]  And I always thought they were.
[2199.52 --> 2201.52]  And it's not just Amazon.
[2201.52 --> 2202.52]  They're all doing this.
[2202.52 --> 2203.52]  Yes.
[2203.52 --> 2204.52]  Apple does this.
[2204.52 --> 2205.52]  Google does this as well.
[2205.52 --> 2211.52]  I'm very surprised this was news because how else are you supposed to do it?
[2211.52 --> 2212.52]  Yeah, of course.
[2212.52 --> 2213.52]  That's why I sound like, duh.
[2213.52 --> 2214.52]  Yeah, it's pretty weird.
[2214.52 --> 2219.52]  I think one thing that does concern me is like, do they sell this data?
[2219.52 --> 2222.52]  Because they're super unrelated.
[2222.52 --> 2225.52]  And this might, I don't really use these devices too often.
[2225.52 --> 2226.52]  So I don't know.
[2226.52 --> 2231.52]  But I have one, but I just, it's right by my computer.
[2231.52 --> 2233.52]  So I usually just end up using a browser anyways.
[2233.52 --> 2235.52]  I don't know, whatever.
[2235.52 --> 2239.52]  But like, do outside apps have listened, I guess?
[2239.52 --> 2242.52]  But like read access to these files effectively?
[2242.52 --> 2244.52]  I don't.
[2244.52 --> 2254.52]  Like could an app that ties into your Echo get read access to your voice to try to figure out its side of things better?
[2254.52 --> 2256.52]  I don't think so.
[2256.52 --> 2257.52]  Probably not?
[2257.52 --> 2258.52]  No.
[2258.52 --> 2259.52]  I don't think so.
[2259.52 --> 2260.52]  I think it, um.
[2260.52 --> 2263.52]  But like that, so my reference for this very shot in the dark thing.
[2263.52 --> 2264.52]  Yeah.
[2264.52 --> 2265.52]  I totally, I'm not surprised you say I don't think so.
[2265.52 --> 2271.52]  Um, but my reference for that is the Gmail thing that happened forever ago that I brought up before the show.
[2271.52 --> 2280.52]  Where people didn't realize that a lot of, not a lot actually, but some, very few third party apps have read access to your emails.
[2280.52 --> 2289.52]  And people were personally reading those emails and there was apparently accounts of people like finding funny videos and emails and sharing it to each other for laughs and stuff.
[2289.52 --> 2291.52]  So first of all, it would be.
[2291.52 --> 2292.52]  This is pretty unrelated.
[2292.52 --> 2293.52]  This would be text, right?
[2293.52 --> 2295.52]  Because it's going to go.
[2295.52 --> 2296.52]  Right.
[2296.52 --> 2298.52]  To Google servers and be transcribed as text.
[2298.52 --> 2301.52]  And then they wouldn't even get the raw text, I wouldn't think.
[2301.52 --> 2308.52]  Um, because, or I would think they wouldn't get the raw text because Google would have to say, oh, this is a command for this API and then send that.
[2308.52 --> 2309.52]  No.
[2309.52 --> 2310.52]  Google keeps the audio recording.
[2310.52 --> 2311.52]  Yeah.
[2311.52 --> 2312.52]  Yeah.
[2312.52 --> 2313.52]  I don't know about Amazon, but Google keeps the audio recording.
[2313.52 --> 2315.52]  They do, but what I'm saying is to give it to the third party.
[2315.52 --> 2316.52]  Google would receive the audio.
[2316.52 --> 2317.52]  Oh.
[2317.52 --> 2318.52]  Turn it to text.
[2318.52 --> 2322.52]  And then determine, oh, this text is relevant to that third party and then hand that command over.
[2322.52 --> 2326.52]  So they probably do get the text, but they almost certainly don't get the voice.
[2326.52 --> 2327.52]  I don't think they even get the raw text.
[2327.52 --> 2331.52]  I think they get the determination of what that text was.
[2331.52 --> 2334.52]  Because, and there are some commands you have to issue on random TVs.
[2334.52 --> 2339.52]  I've seen this where you have to be, hi, Google, ask third party to do this.
[2339.52 --> 2342.52]  Like, hi, Google, ask LG to turn off the lights.
[2342.52 --> 2343.52]  Okay.
[2343.52 --> 2349.52]  And then that's just like, maybe in that case, because you're explicitly saying, ask LG, then LG would get the full thing.
[2349.52 --> 2350.52]  I don't know.
[2350.52 --> 2351.52]  Who knows?
[2351.52 --> 2352.52]  How these interactions work.
[2352.52 --> 2362.52]  Well, one point I wanted to make was, you would think intuitively that when they're listening to these voice clips, that they would be a random sample, a big swath from all the users.
[2362.52 --> 2363.52]  But maybe it's not.
[2363.52 --> 2366.52]  Maybe there's some users that they're listening to more.
[2366.52 --> 2372.52]  Like maybe, maybe if you have a Scottish accent or an accent that has conventionally been very difficult for these.
[2372.52 --> 2373.52]  A little bit more difficult.
[2373.52 --> 2375.52]  They're like, oh, that guy's great.
[2375.52 --> 2376.52]  We're going to train on that guy.
[2376.52 --> 2380.52]  I mean, there's overfitting problems in machine learning if you only use a few examples like that.
[2380.52 --> 2384.52]  But they, it might be a subset of the population that's getting listened to more often.
[2384.52 --> 2385.52]  Yeah.
[2385.52 --> 2386.52]  Could happen.
[2386.52 --> 2387.52]  I suspect it would be.
[2387.52 --> 2395.52]  If you have like a super generic voice for an area that has a very high population, it's less likely that, I guess, yours would be used for sampling super often.
[2395.52 --> 2396.52]  Yeah.
[2396.52 --> 2400.52]  Or if you're, if they're trying to break into a new market, or they know that they suck at that market.
[2400.52 --> 2401.52]  And they only have a few users.
[2401.52 --> 2403.52]  And you're like on the forefront of technology in that area.
[2403.52 --> 2404.52]  Yeah.
[2404.52 --> 2406.52]  You're like, well, we only have 10 people from Glasgow.
[2406.52 --> 2407.52]  We're going to use all of them.
[2407.52 --> 2408.52]  Yeah.
[2408.52 --> 2409.52]  A lot.
[2409.52 --> 2410.52]  Yeah.
[2410.52 --> 2411.52]  Okay.
[2411.52 --> 2417.52]  The big question in everyone's mind right now is probably like, hey, when they're listening to this voice clip of me, do they know it's me?
[2417.52 --> 2425.52]  In the case of Amazon, it appears that they know your first name and like there's a product serial number or something, but they don't have your last name or other, any other identifying things.
[2425.52 --> 2427.52]  In the case of Apple, I think they have less than that.
[2427.52 --> 2432.52]  They don't have your first name and they have a randomly generated number to associate to your account.
[2433.52 --> 2434.52]  So it's pretty safe.
[2434.52 --> 2439.52]  That said, the clip can contain sensitive information.
[2439.52 --> 2441.52]  I could be talking about my friend's full name.
[2441.52 --> 2443.52]  I could be talking about my bank stuff.
[2443.52 --> 2444.52]  I could be talking about anything.
[2444.52 --> 2447.52]  Dude, some of my, I looked into my own, this was years ago.
[2447.52 --> 2453.52]  It's probably better at detection now, but I looked into my own like, hey, boogle information.
[2453.52 --> 2455.52]  That probably worked actually.
[2455.52 --> 2456.52]  Yeah.
[2456.52 --> 2457.52]  I say, that's why you say hi.
[2457.52 --> 2458.52]  That's why I said hi.
[2458.52 --> 2459.52]  Yeah.
[2459.52 --> 2460.52]  Anyway.
[2460.52 --> 2461.52]  My bad.
[2461.52 --> 2465.52]  But I looked into like all the different audio snip recording things.
[2465.52 --> 2474.52]  The amount of times that I was in the car and just like an audio book or the radio was on, where definitely no one said that and it just has a recording of that is insane.
[2474.52 --> 2475.52]  Oh, wow.
[2475.52 --> 2479.52]  The amount of recordings there are of me not trying to interact with it is wild.
[2479.52 --> 2480.52]  Wow.
[2480.52 --> 2481.52]  Like many hundreds.
[2481.52 --> 2483.52]  How do you know for sure that definitely no one said that?
[2483.52 --> 2486.52]  Because I believe that after the hot word, then there's a delay and then the recording.
[2486.52 --> 2487.52]  So the audio book.
[2487.52 --> 2489.52]  I would be silent in the car.
[2489.52 --> 2492.52]  Yeah, but the audio book could have said it like a second before.
[2492.52 --> 2494.52]  They're like Star Wars audio books generally.
[2494.52 --> 2495.52]  You would be surprised.
[2495.52 --> 2500.52]  Like I said, mine's beside my couch and I can hear it when it gets activated and you'd be surprised sometimes what activates it.
[2500.52 --> 2501.52]  Like let's go.
[2501.52 --> 2504.52]  They might say let's go and it activates it.
[2504.52 --> 2505.52]  Oh, no, yeah.
[2505.52 --> 2510.52]  But what I'm saying is like it wasn't unintentional activations.
[2510.52 --> 2514.52]  It might be like I'm sure there's a sound that sounded something like whatever.
[2514.52 --> 2518.52]  Maybe some alien has a weird name in Star Wars.
[2518.52 --> 2523.52]  But like the amount of times what all I was saying is unintentional stuff that ends up in there.
[2523.52 --> 2524.52]  Yeah.
[2524.52 --> 2526.52]  And you were saying like personal information.
[2526.52 --> 2527.52]  Obviously Star Wars doesn't count for that.
[2527.52 --> 2529.52]  But there was a lot of other recordings as well.
[2529.52 --> 2530.52]  Where it's just like a random.
[2530.52 --> 2535.52]  I can barely even remember the conversation, but it's clearly a random conversation between me and a friend.
[2535.52 --> 2537.52]  I'm clearly not trying to interact with you.
[2537.52 --> 2538.52]  I see what you're saying.
[2538.52 --> 2542.52]  A lot of what happens to me is I'll have people over like a dinner party or something.
[2542.52 --> 2545.52]  I'll interact with it to change the song.
[2545.52 --> 2548.52]  And then I know I can just kind of turn away and keep talking.
[2548.52 --> 2553.52]  And I know that the machine will know that what I'm talking about now isn't relevant.
[2553.52 --> 2556.52]  So even though the light's still blinking, it'll be like yeah.
[2556.52 --> 2558.52]  And I can just keep having my conversation.
[2558.52 --> 2559.52]  But that's going to be recorded.
[2559.52 --> 2561.52]  There's going to be an extra eight seconds of me talking about tacos.
[2561.52 --> 2562.52]  Yeah.
[2562.52 --> 2565.52]  Yeah, I don't know.
[2565.52 --> 2573.52]  This is the kind of stuff where like a lot of modern technologies in various ways, you give up certain privacies or securities to have those technologies.
[2573.52 --> 2574.52]  And this is one of them.
[2574.52 --> 2579.52]  If you want to have a smart speaker in your home, just understand this stuff and move forward.
[2579.52 --> 2584.52]  You're caring about your security is very important.
[2584.52 --> 2586.52]  It's probably fine though.
[2586.52 --> 2588.52]  Like, what do you think of this question?
[2588.52 --> 2597.52]  Though the job is usually uninteresting, two workers said that they heard what they believe to be an instance of sexual assault.
[2597.52 --> 2602.52]  They were told eventually that it was not Amazon's responsibility to take action.
[2602.52 --> 2604.52]  So, you know, they go to their manager.
[2604.52 --> 2608.52]  You guys, someone at the company has the means to find out who this is.
[2608.52 --> 2615.52]  Like, should we tell the authorities and say, you know, like someone got beaten up here or like they should get a record or something like that?
[2615.52 --> 2625.52]  One of the big problems with this is just like role play BDSM, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[2625.52 --> 2628.52]  Where like it could be totally above board.
[2628.52 --> 2629.52]  Mm.
[2629.52 --> 2633.52]  And now there's the police knocking on your door because you have an AI helper robot thing.
[2633.52 --> 2634.52]  Yeah.
[2634.52 --> 2636.52]  And you never authorized.
[2636.52 --> 2637.52]  Maybe it's a movie.
[2637.52 --> 2638.52]  Yeah.
[2638.52 --> 2642.52]  Maybe it's a weird freaky anime, you crazy people.
[2642.52 --> 2643.52]  Yeah.
[2643.52 --> 2645.52]  Like, I don't know.
[2645.52 --> 2654.52]  That to me is a little bit like I totally appreciate the idea of reducing those types of things.
[2654.52 --> 2657.52]  But the minority report also freaks me the hell out.
[2657.52 --> 2663.52]  And there's a lot of stuff that could make someone think that that are OK.
[2663.52 --> 2664.52]  Yeah.
[2664.52 --> 2665.52]  Yeah.
[2665.52 --> 2666.52]  Yeah.
[2666.52 --> 2667.52]  It's not it is not their responsibility.
[2667.52 --> 2668.52]  That is true.
[2668.52 --> 2669.52]  I agree with Amazon's take there.
[2669.52 --> 2670.52]  It's not.
[2670.52 --> 2674.52]  Although they might have a responsibility if something actually does happen and they get subpoenaed to release.
[2674.52 --> 2677.52]  Recordings, they've had to do that in the past.
[2677.52 --> 2679.52]  You know, if it can be used as evidence.
[2679.52 --> 2686.52]  But I think that's whether you think that's OK or not, that is definitely a totally different thing.
[2686.52 --> 2688.52]  They're not being proactive.
[2688.52 --> 2691.52]  They're reacting to law enforcement like it's whether you think it's OK or not.
[2691.52 --> 2693.52]  I think they're in totally different segments.
[2693.52 --> 2694.52]  I agree with you there.
[2694.52 --> 2695.52]  Yeah.
[2695.52 --> 2696.52]  Super chats.
[2696.52 --> 2697.52]  Super chats.
[2697.52 --> 2698.52]  Let's go.
[2698.52 --> 2700.52]  They're like normal chats, but Uber.
[2700.52 --> 2701.52]  Super.
[2701.52 --> 2702.52]  Super.
[2702.52 --> 2705.52]  Bunch of people sending $1 with no text.
[2705.52 --> 2706.52]  I appreciate it.
[2706.52 --> 2707.52]  Very nice.
[2707.52 --> 2708.52]  Appreciate you.
[2708.52 --> 2712.52]  Someone's asking about some lag on Flowplane.
[2712.52 --> 2718.52]  I think we know what's going on there, but it seems like it did go pretty well today.
[2718.52 --> 2721.52]  Every week it's improving a little bit.
[2721.52 --> 2726.52]  I like the pictures you guys have on the wall.
[2726.52 --> 2727.52]  Cool.
[2727.52 --> 2732.52]  Go to Flowplane and buy Luke a better office.
[2732.52 --> 2733.52]  Heck yeah.
[2733.52 --> 2736.52]  I like my office right now, but we do have to move because LMG is expanding so darn fast.
[2736.52 --> 2737.52]  You guys got to move?
[2737.52 --> 2738.52]  Eventually.
[2738.52 --> 2740.52]  Because you guys are going to be out of space.
[2740.52 --> 2741.52]  Yeah.
[2741.52 --> 2742.52]  Like actually.
[2742.52 --> 2743.52]  Good God.
[2743.52 --> 2746.52]  I think the rate at which LMG is hiring is just wild.
[2746.52 --> 2747.52]  And Flowplane's hiring too.
[2747.52 --> 2749.52]  And I'm trying to bring people in locally.
[2749.52 --> 2753.52]  Like there's one, Will is moving here very soon.
[2753.52 --> 2754.52]  Oh, yeah.
[2754.52 --> 2757.52]  One of the new hires that we have is a Canadian who will be moving here locally.
[2757.52 --> 2761.52]  So like within the next six months, we'll probably have two more people locally.
[2761.52 --> 2762.52]  Yeah.
[2762.52 --> 2763.52]  And there's other people moving in locally for Flowplane.
[2763.52 --> 2764.52]  That's all it takes.
[2764.52 --> 2765.52]  Honestly, like if-
[2765.52 --> 2767.52]  We're already oversized at that point.
[2767.52 --> 2770.52]  Between the two companies, there are six more people, it'll be over.
[2770.52 --> 2771.52]  Done.
[2771.52 --> 2772.52]  Yeah.
[2772.52 --> 2773.52]  And that's going to happen really soon.
[2773.52 --> 2774.52]  Yeah.
[2774.52 --> 2776.52]  So like I'm actively looking for other places.
[2776.52 --> 2779.52]  It's going to be really weird, but oh well.
[2779.52 --> 2782.52]  Are you still going to come over for Friday Wands?
[2782.52 --> 2786.52]  That'd be sweet if you guys were just in this complex or something.
[2786.52 --> 2787.52]  That'd be pretty.
[2787.52 --> 2789.52]  So I wanted that too, but realistically, these are all-
[2789.52 --> 2791.52]  These buildings aren't suited for that really.
[2791.52 --> 2792.52]  Yeah.
[2792.52 --> 2793.52]  We just need office space.
[2793.52 --> 2794.52]  Yeah.
[2794.52 --> 2795.52]  So it's like probably-
[2795.52 --> 2796.52]  You should go downtown.
[2796.52 --> 2798.52]  Be one of those like exposed brick, polished concrete, super hip.
[2798.52 --> 2799.52]  So expensive.
[2799.52 --> 2801.52]  Yeah, you're a startup though, baby.
[2801.52 --> 2802.52]  Yeah.
[2802.52 --> 2804.52]  Get that investor cash.
[2804.52 --> 2805.52]  Ugh.
[2805.52 --> 2806.52]  There's a-
[2806.52 --> 2807.52]  Ugh.
[2807.52 --> 2810.52]  Just reading about people in our space, not even necessarily competitors, but in our
[2810.52 --> 2814.52]  space that are like, oh yeah, they just got like 20 to 40 million dollars in VC funding.
[2814.52 --> 2815.52]  I'm like, ugh.
[2815.52 --> 2816.52]  Oh, jeez.
[2816.52 --> 2817.52]  Um.
[2817.52 --> 2818.52]  Yep.
[2818.52 --> 2820.52]  People talking about the audio.
[2820.52 --> 2822.52]  Apparently the focus was screwed up like the whole show.
[2822.52 --> 2824.52]  The focus is for like the back of our chairs.
[2824.52 --> 2827.52]  So when you and I are leaning forward, we're like super out of focus.
[2827.52 --> 2828.52]  Oh.
[2828.52 --> 2829.52]  Oh, well.
[2829.52 --> 2830.52]  So that sucks.
[2830.52 --> 2831.52]  Did they offline us?
[2831.52 --> 2832.52]  No.
[2832.52 --> 2833.52]  He was away and then his plane came in late, I believe.
[2833.52 --> 2834.52]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[2834.52 --> 2835.52]  Um.
[2835.52 --> 2837.52]  I don't think he was planning to come ever though.
[2837.52 --> 2838.52]  Probably not.
[2838.52 --> 2840.52]  Cause like he was in England today.
[2840.52 --> 2841.52]  Yeah.
[2841.52 --> 2842.52]  Time shift is going to be super weird.
[2842.52 --> 2843.52]  No, thanks.
[2843.52 --> 2844.52]  Yeah.
[2844.52 --> 2845.52]  Um.
[2845.52 --> 2848.52]  I dare you guys to eat the Carolina Reaper savage jerky.
[2848.52 --> 2851.52]  I don't think they were sponsored this week, so we don't have any here, but we've done
[2851.52 --> 2852.52]  it before.
[2852.52 --> 2853.52]  Uh.
[2853.52 --> 2854.52]  On my very first WAN I did that.
[2854.52 --> 2855.52]  Oh, damn.
[2855.52 --> 2860.52]  Alexa and Google Home do save recordings where nothing happens.
[2860.52 --> 2862.52]  I just researched this and tested for a class project.
[2862.52 --> 2863.52]  Send us your paper, bro.
[2863.52 --> 2864.52]  Yeah.
[2864.52 --> 2865.52]  I'm interested.
[2865.52 --> 2866.52]  Do it up.
[2866.52 --> 2867.52]  Email me your thesis.
[2867.52 --> 2870.52]  Luke from one broadcast dye your hair green.
[2870.52 --> 2875.52]  Oh, I think green's the ugliest hair color.
[2875.52 --> 2876.52]  And love from India.
[2876.52 --> 2878.52]  Well, actually depends on the green.
[2878.52 --> 2880.52]  I think it can be definitely.
[2880.52 --> 2881.52]  It can be.
[2881.52 --> 2882.52]  Yeah.
[2882.52 --> 2883.52]  Anyways, that's it for super chats.
[2883.52 --> 2885.52]  I believe we're, wait, are we done?
[2885.52 --> 2886.52]  No.
[2886.52 --> 2887.52]  We have one more topic.
[2887.52 --> 2888.52]  Yeah.
[2888.52 --> 2890.52]  There's one more.
[2890.52 --> 2892.52]  Oh, I see what people are talking about.
[2892.52 --> 2893.52]  Sorry about that.
[2893.52 --> 2894.52]  There you go.
[2894.52 --> 2895.52]  What is the one more?
[2895.52 --> 2897.52]  Walmart adding more robots.
[2897.52 --> 2899.52]  Walmart already employs many robots.
[2899.52 --> 2901.52]  They're getting lots more.
[2901.52 --> 2909.52]  They have announced that they will deploy 1,500 new auto-sea autonomous floor cleaners.
[2909.52 --> 2912.52]  You know, like those floor cleaner things that people ride on like me and that kind of like
[2912.52 --> 2913.52]  little Zambonis.
[2913.52 --> 2916.52]  I think they don't need those anymore.
[2916.52 --> 2917.52]  But 1,500.
[2917.52 --> 2919.52]  How many Wal-Mart locations are there?
[2919.52 --> 2925.52]  Because there's not very many in the grand scheme of Wal-Mart.
[2925.52 --> 2926.52]  Like here, okay.
[2926.52 --> 2927.52]  Wal-Marts are large though.
[2927.52 --> 2929.52]  I'm going to make a guess.
[2929.52 --> 2931.52]  How many Wal-Mart locations are there?
[2931.52 --> 2932.52]  There's 50 states.
[2932.52 --> 2933.52]  They're in multiple countries.
[2933.52 --> 2935.52]  I'm going to say 3,000.
[2935.52 --> 2936.52]  4,700.
[2936.52 --> 2939.52]  That's actually, I guess it's more than you thought.
[2939.52 --> 2940.52]  I was guessing around 6K.
[2940.52 --> 2941.52]  So this is pretty significant.
[2941.52 --> 2946.52]  Do you think that they're going to get one floor cleaner per store?
[2946.52 --> 2950.52]  Like in their test, the subset of stores that are testing this, do you think they're getting
[2950.52 --> 2951.52]  more than one?
[2951.52 --> 2952.52]  Yeah.
[2952.52 --> 2953.52]  No, I think they'd just get one.
[2953.52 --> 2954.52]  Just one.
[2954.52 --> 2955.52]  Okay.
[2955.52 --> 2956.52]  Because if it's automated, it can cruise around and do whatever.
[2956.52 --> 2957.52]  All night.
[2957.52 --> 2958.52]  Yeah.
[2958.52 --> 2959.52]  Yeah.
[2959.52 --> 2960.52]  1,500 Auto-C autonomous floor cleaners.
[2960.52 --> 2965.52]  They're getting only 300 Auto-S shelf scanners.
[2965.52 --> 2967.52]  What does that thing do?
[2967.52 --> 2969.52]  Probably just check inventory.
[2969.52 --> 2970.52]  How?
[2970.52 --> 2974.52]  I'm picturing like those like surveillance drones in Star Wars that are like those balls
[2974.52 --> 2977.52]  with all the antennas, like just hovering down the aisles.
[2977.52 --> 2978.52]  Yeah.
[2978.52 --> 2979.52]  Pop, pop.
[2979.52 --> 2980.52]  That'd be awesome.
[2980.52 --> 2984.52]  I suspect it's just going to ride along the ledge of the shelf.
[2984.52 --> 2986.52]  You think it's, I don't know.
[2986.52 --> 2987.52]  I don't know.
[2987.52 --> 2988.52]  I'm really not sure.
[2988.52 --> 2995.52]  They're getting an additional 1,200 fast unloaders to scan and sort items as they come
[2995.52 --> 2996.52]  off delivery trucks.
[2996.52 --> 2997.52]  This one's interesting.
[2997.52 --> 3004.52]  Plus, to streamline online orders, it'll have 900 pickup towers so customers can order
[3004.52 --> 3009.52]  something on the company's site and pick it up from a vending machine at their nearest
[3009.52 --> 3010.52]  Walmart.
[3010.52 --> 3012.52]  Oh, that's less interesting than what I thought it was.
[3012.52 --> 3013.52]  Because it's out of Walmart.
[3013.52 --> 3015.52]  I thought Walmart was like building towers across the country.
[3015.52 --> 3017.52]  I'm just like, this is getting very medieval corporate.
[3017.52 --> 3018.52]  It's just a big lockbox.
[3018.52 --> 3019.52]  But it's just, yeah.
[3019.52 --> 3020.52]  And it's at a Walmart location.
[3020.52 --> 3023.52]  It's really not that interesting at all.
[3023.52 --> 3024.52]  Just buy from the store.
[3024.52 --> 3026.52]  Yeah, holy cow.
[3026.52 --> 3031.52]  The idea is that by pushing menial tasks to the robots, Walmart's human employees can
[3031.52 --> 3035.52]  spend more time helping customers and preparing online orders for pickup.
[3035.52 --> 3036.52]  That is sweet.
[3036.52 --> 3037.52]  Bull crap.
[3037.52 --> 3038.52]  Yes.
[3038.52 --> 3039.52]  They'll just fire them.
[3039.52 --> 3041.52]  They'll replace them eventually.
[3041.52 --> 3042.52]  Yeah.
[3042.52 --> 3043.52]  But it is, at least for now.
[3043.52 --> 3044.52]  I guess in the meantime, while they're unsure.
[3044.52 --> 3047.52]  In the meantime, it's like, hey, you don't have to do this anymore so you can just help people,
[3047.52 --> 3048.52]  which is cool.
[3048.52 --> 3049.52]  We got a few years of awesome.
[3049.52 --> 3050.52]  Yes.
[3050.52 --> 3051.52]  And then a lot less people have jobs.
[3051.52 --> 3054.52]  It sucks when you're walking around a store and you're like, who works here?
[3054.52 --> 3056.52]  And then you see someone who works there and they're doing something.
[3056.52 --> 3058.52]  And you're like, hey, can I bug you?
[3058.52 --> 3060.52]  And they're like, I guess.
[3060.52 --> 3061.52]  Yes.
[3061.52 --> 3065.52]  One thing I've always wanted, especially at Home Depot, is like, and Home Depot has an
[3065.52 --> 3069.52]  app that I believe is supposed to do this, but last time I tried it, it sucked.
[3069.52 --> 3072.52]  But maybe it's gotten better because I haven't tried it in forever.
[3072.52 --> 3075.52]  But I want to be able to be on my phone in the store and just be like, where the heck
[3075.52 --> 3076.52]  is this thing?
[3076.52 --> 3077.52]  And have it tell me.
[3077.52 --> 3078.52]  Turn left.
[3078.52 --> 3081.52]  Because that's pretty much the only reason why I ever need store employees.
[3081.52 --> 3082.52]  Yeah, for sure.
[3082.52 --> 3086.52]  Where the heck is this, like, the last thing I needed was like a shelf peg.
[3086.52 --> 3089.52]  It's like, where would that be?
[3089.52 --> 3090.52]  Mmm.
[3090.52 --> 3091.52]  A shelf peg.
[3091.52 --> 3092.52]  Yeah.
[3092.52 --> 3093.52]  Like, what's that?
[3093.52 --> 3097.52]  Like, the little, like, clear plastic little L-shaped thing that you put in the hole on
[3097.52 --> 3099.52]  a shelf to hold the individual.
[3099.52 --> 3100.52]  Oh, like a bracket.
[3100.52 --> 3104.52]  Like, like a, that you put shelves on.
[3104.52 --> 3105.52]  No, no, no.
[3105.52 --> 3106.52]  But they're like, super tiny.
[3106.52 --> 3107.52]  Oh.
[3107.52 --> 3108.52]  Like this big.
[3108.52 --> 3111.52]  It has a little metal nubbit and there's a hole drilled in the shelf.
[3111.52 --> 3112.52]  Did you just say nubbit?
[3112.52 --> 3113.52]  Nubbit.
[3113.52 --> 3114.52]  I don't know what to call it.
[3114.52 --> 3115.52]  Okay.
[3115.52 --> 3116.52]  I wouldn't know where to buy that either, dude.
[3116.52 --> 3117.52]  Right.
[3117.52 --> 3118.52]  I mean, Tyra has it.
[3118.52 --> 3119.52]  Isle and shelf.
[3119.52 --> 3120.52]  That's cool.
[3120.52 --> 3121.52]  That's sweet.
[3121.52 --> 3123.52]  But like, do you have to install an app?
[3123.52 --> 3124.52]  I know I just said-
[3124.52 --> 3126.52]  Does nubbit have two Ts?
[3126.52 --> 3127.52]  What even is-
[3127.52 --> 3128.52]  New bits.
[3128.52 --> 3130.52]  World's best stable digital currencies.
[3130.52 --> 3131.52]  Nubbit.
[3131.52 --> 3132.52]  Two Bs maybe?
[3132.52 --> 3133.52]  N-U-B-B-I-T?
[3133.52 --> 3134.52]  What is a nubbit, dude?
[3134.52 --> 3136.52]  Urban dictionary, nubbit.
[3136.52 --> 3137.52]  Oh, jeez.
[3137.52 --> 3138.52]  It's a word now.
[3138.52 --> 3139.52]  Yeah.
[3139.52 --> 3140.52]  Someone make a new entry.
[3140.52 --> 3141.52]  Yeah, sure.
[3141.52 --> 3142.52]  There we go.
[3142.52 --> 3143.52]  A nubbit.
[3143.52 --> 3144.52]  Make it not the one that's on there right now.
[3144.52 --> 3145.52]  It's like a nubbin.
[3145.52 --> 3146.52]  No, just their site.
[3146.52 --> 3147.52]  Okay, that's cool.
[3147.52 --> 3152.52]  Being able to use, apparently, Canadian Tire website to look for an item and let you know
[3152.52 --> 3153.52]  where it is.
[3153.52 --> 3154.52]  But then like-
[3154.52 --> 3155.52]  I wonder-
[3155.52 --> 3156.52]  But then like-
[3156.52 --> 3157.52]  But how do they let you know?
[3157.52 --> 3159.52]  Do they say, like, isle for you?
[3159.52 --> 3160.52]  Isle and shelf.
[3160.52 --> 3161.52]  It's good enough for me.
[3161.52 --> 3162.52]  Oh, that's pretty good.
[3162.52 --> 3163.52]  Yeah.
[3163.52 --> 3164.52]  One thing-
[3164.52 --> 3166.52]  Can I just say I'd like to have a beep?
[3166.52 --> 3168.52]  I'd like to have a warmer, colder-
[3168.52 --> 3169.52]  Beep.
[3169.52 --> 3170.52]  Beep.
[3170.52 --> 3171.52]  Is that an alien?
[3171.52 --> 3172.52]  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep,
[3172.52 --> 3173.52]  ahhh!
[3173.52 --> 3174.52]  They're really close to us.
[3174.52 --> 3175.52]  I think so.
[3175.52 --> 3176.52]  I think that's the original alien stuff.
[3176.52 --> 3177.52]  Yeah.
[3177.52 --> 3179.52]  I don't think that's Predator, so yeah, I think so.
[3179.52 --> 3183.52]  But I, like, one thing that I think is pretty important too, though, is that it needs to be
[3183.52 --> 3186.52]  pretty good at guessing what the heck you're talking about.
[3186.52 --> 3187.52]  Yeah.
[3187.52 --> 3190.52]  Because especially in a place like Home Depot or Lowe's or whatever where it's like hardware,
[3190.52 --> 3194.52]  the amount of people that are gonna go in there and be like, I need a screw.
[3194.52 --> 3196.52]  It's like, what screw?
[3196.52 --> 3198.52]  It's like, uh, this one.
[3198.52 --> 3199.52]  Like, I don't know.
[3199.52 --> 3201.52]  It would be cool if you can take a picture or something.
[3201.52 --> 3205.52]  Well, the one way to do that, like, yeah, you could take a picture when you get it,
[3205.52 --> 3207.52]  but no one's gonna do that.
[3207.52 --> 3210.52]  But another way you could do it is if you had an account and you were signed in.
[3210.52 --> 3213.52]  Then when you go to check out, they have a record of what you bought.
[3213.52 --> 3217.52]  So if what you bought is even remotely close to what you searched, they'd be like, ah,
[3217.52 --> 3218.52]  that's what he meant by nubbit.
[3221.52 --> 3224.52]  So we can learn what the heck nubbit is over time.
[3225.52 --> 3226.52]  Shelf nubbits.
[3226.52 --> 3227.52]  Heck yeah.
[3227.52 --> 3229.52]  I called them.
[3229.52 --> 3234.52]  The reason why I'm, like, particularly triggered about this shelf peg thing is because I, it
[3234.52 --> 3236.52]  took me, I think, four or five employees to find it.
[3236.52 --> 3237.52]  Oh, yeah.
[3237.52 --> 3240.52]  Because I'd ask one and they'd send me somewhere and I'd get in there and I'd be like, this
[3240.52 --> 3241.52]  is planks of wood.
[3241.52 --> 3244.52]  This is not plastic things with little metal things coming out of them.
[3244.52 --> 3246.52]  They just, they didn't accompany you.
[3246.52 --> 3248.52]  They just sent you and see you later.
[3248.52 --> 3251.52]  But, like, honestly, they're so freaking busy.
[3251.52 --> 3253.52]  Each one of them were helping, like, three or four people.
[3253.52 --> 3254.52]  They couldn't move.
[3254.52 --> 3255.52]  I didn't blame them.
[3255.52 --> 3258.52]  They need more A, they need more auto C's and auto S's.
[3258.52 --> 3259.52]  Yeah.
[3259.52 --> 3260.52]  To help them.
[3260.52 --> 3261.52]  Come on, Home Depot.
[3261.52 --> 3262.52]  Figure it out.
[3262.52 --> 3265.52]  Eventually it'll just be no one working the checkout.
[3265.52 --> 3268.52]  It'll be guest service and a couple people walking around.
[3268.52 --> 3269.52]  And then that's it.
[3269.52 --> 3270.52]  Yeah.
[3270.52 --> 3274.52]  And even then that'll probably eventually go away.
[3274.52 --> 3276.52]  They're all just Amazon Go stores?
[3276.52 --> 3277.52]  Pretty much.
[3277.52 --> 3278.52]  Like.
[3278.52 --> 3282.52]  And then there might even be those, like, remote presence style robots, but there's no one actually
[3282.52 --> 3284.52]  there and it's just an AI that just rolls around.
[3284.52 --> 3285.52]  How are you doing today?
[3285.52 --> 3286.52]  Hmm.
[3286.52 --> 3289.52]  And if they have to, you can do a live chat.
[3289.52 --> 3290.52]  You just get someone up on the screen.
[3290.52 --> 3291.52]  Yeah.
[3291.52 --> 3292.52]  Alright dude, what?
[3292.52 --> 3293.52]  What?
[3293.52 --> 3294.52]  What do you need?
[3294.52 --> 3297.52]  How did you get elevated to this?
[3297.52 --> 3298.52]  The nubits are over there.
[3298.52 --> 3300.52]  Why did you press zero five times?
[3300.52 --> 3301.52]  Come on, give me a break.
[3301.52 --> 3303.52]  It's a Friday.
[3303.52 --> 3304.52]  Yeah.
[3304.52 --> 3306.52]  I don't know.
[3306.52 --> 3313.52]  I kind of, is it, I don't know if I'm naive or just a butthole, but I kind of welcome
[3313.52 --> 3315.52]  the disappearance of jobs.
[3315.52 --> 3318.52]  If you go to a grocery store that has automated checkout.
[3318.52 --> 3319.52]  Really?
[3319.52 --> 3321.52]  That's not the direction I thought you were going with.
[3321.52 --> 3322.52]  Yeah.
[3322.52 --> 3325.52]  Like, I've been to a McDonald's once in Australia and these young people, I was using the, it
[3325.52 --> 3326.52]  was empty.
[3326.52 --> 3327.52]  Okay.
[3327.52 --> 3328.52]  There was no line up.
[3328.52 --> 3329.52]  These young people.
[3329.52 --> 3330.52]  There was no line up.
[3330.52 --> 3336.52]  And these young women were like, hey, don't use the self menu thing.
[3336.52 --> 3338.52]  Save someone's job and go up there.
[3338.52 --> 3340.52]  And I was like, nope.
[3340.52 --> 3345.52]  I would like to send the signal that I prefer this.
[3345.52 --> 3348.52]  I don't think you, anyone should work at the front of this.
[3348.52 --> 3349.52]  I don't, I don't know.
[3349.52 --> 3350.52]  I think maybe because.
[3350.52 --> 3351.52]  How do you want to solve that problem?
[3351.52 --> 3352.52]  I'm a techno optimist.
[3352.52 --> 3353.52]  Yeah, yeah.
[3353.52 --> 3359.52]  Because I, I like to believe that in the eventual future where no one's working there, the people
[3359.52 --> 3364.52]  that are working are getting paid a lot and the people aren't working are on a beach playing
[3364.52 --> 3365.52]  guitar.
[3365.52 --> 3369.52]  I love this idea, but how do you like fund those people?
[3369.52 --> 3370.52]  Corporate taxes.
[3370.52 --> 3371.52]  Corporate taxes.
[3371.52 --> 3372.52]  Okay.
[3372.52 --> 3374.52]  I don't have all the answers, man.
[3374.52 --> 3378.52]  I'm not like Noah Yuval Harari or whatever, but I can dream.
[3378.52 --> 3383.52]  See, but I think one of my problems there is like you would need, this is going super
[3383.52 --> 3388.52]  off topic and the show's almost over so we can cut it pretty quick, but like how aggressive
[3388.52 --> 3391.52]  are your allowances for small business then?
[3391.52 --> 3396.52]  Because there's a lot of industries like the one float plane is trying to get into now that
[3396.52 --> 3400.52]  to penetrate properly, you're going to have to get relatively large.
[3400.52 --> 3401.52]  Yeah.
[3401.52 --> 3402.52]  You mean stuff like content.
[3402.52 --> 3407.52]  If we had super aggressive corporate taxes so that people that would be working at McDonald's
[3407.52 --> 3411.52]  and they don't actually need to do that job because that should be automated relatively
[3411.52 --> 3415.52]  quickly because we're wasting human potential can go sit on a beach or make art or whatever.
[3415.52 --> 3420.52]  If our corporate taxes have to pay for that, we're screwed when we have to go up against
[3420.52 --> 3421.52]  these giant companies.
[3421.52 --> 3422.52]  Sure.
[3422.52 --> 3424.52]  There's other proposals.
[3424.52 --> 3429.52]  Someone had a proposal about making robots pay income tax.
[3429.52 --> 3433.52]  I think the Economist magazine was like, that's a bad idea.
[3433.52 --> 3434.52]  I read that article.
[3434.52 --> 3440.52]  I don't remember why it's a bad idea, but I'm not saying that the tools we have now,
[3440.52 --> 3443.52]  are going to be sufficient in that world.
[3443.52 --> 3452.52]  I think I am very strongly in agreeance that like, wow, we're going way off topic here.
[3452.52 --> 3457.52]  But like the, just the, the mass waste of human potential is, is amazing.
[3457.52 --> 3459.52]  Just what the lengths people will go to.
[3459.52 --> 3464.52]  And, and the fact that like someone can be very good at something, but modern hiring processes
[3464.52 --> 3468.52]  have not really gotten much better in like a really long time.
[3468.52 --> 3481.52]  So you have to, even if you're an extremely skilled person at something, you probably have to go through the Walmart or McDonald's or whatever grind so that you can like eventually land a job somewhere good.
[3481.52 --> 3484.52]  Like, like placement of very skilled people is not very good.
[3484.52 --> 3486.52]  Yeah. Especially if you're an immigrant.
[3486.52 --> 3488.52]  Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot of different situations where it's terrible.
[3488.52 --> 3489.52]  I'm an engineer.
[3489.52 --> 3496.52]  I'm a doctor. I'm driving a taxi. I like, and taxis that should probably be automated. Why?
[3496.52 --> 3507.52]  We're so close to that being done. The whole transportation industry is just going to poof. Maybe that's good. Driving a vehicle is not driving a vehicle on most situations.
[3507.52 --> 3513.52]  There are obviously certain situations where it's extremely highly skilled, but in most people's day to day driving vehicles a menial task.
[3513.52 --> 3514.52]  Yeah.
[3514.52 --> 3516.52]  Automate that stuff. Get people doing more and more things.
[3516.52 --> 3517.52]  Get rid of it.
[3517.52 --> 3519.52]  But it's just how do you support those people. Anyways.
[3519.52 --> 3520.52]  It's going to be short term hard.
[3520.52 --> 3523.52]  Yeah. Short term extremely difficult.
[3523.52 --> 3526.52]  Yeah. For individuals whose lives matter.
[3526.52 --> 3527.52]  Yeah.
[3527.52 --> 3528.52]  So let's end the show.
[3528.52 --> 3529.52]  Yeah.
[3529.52 --> 3530.52]  Thanks for tuning in folks.
[3530.52 --> 3531.52]  Outro.
[3531.52 --> 3533.52]  Oh geez. I didn't set it back.
[3533.52 --> 3534.52]  There we go.
[3534.52 --> 3535.52]  One more plug for Dispate right here.
[3535.52 --> 3536.52]  Yeah.
[3536.52 --> 3537.52]  And you're dead.
[3537.52 --> 3538.52]  Whan, whan, whan.
[3538.52 --> 3539.52]  Some guy made an account. Ian Nubbitt.
[3539.52 --> 3540.52]  Subscribe to full of play.
[3540.52 --> 3541.52]  There's another person just made straight up just Nubbitt.
[3541.52 --> 3542.52]  Nubbitts. Ian Nubbitt you're a legend.
[3542.52 --> 3543.52]  Frodo Nubbitts.
[3543.52 --> 3544.52]  Frodo Nubbitts.
[3544.52 --> 3545.52]  There's so many Nubbitts.
[3545.52 --> 3562.52]  What? The Mark Nubbitts? What's happening? I didn't notice this at all.
[3562.52 --> 3563.52]  Welcome to the Nubbitt Show.
[3563.52 --> 3564.52]  Heck yeah.
[3564.52 --> 3569.52]  Everybody make their name something and end with Nubbitt. It will be our inside joke.
[3569.52 --> 3571.52]  Not inside joke anymore.
[3571.52 --> 3573.52]  Very outside.
[3573.52 --> 3577.52]  Displate. PIA. Squarespace.
[3577.52 --> 3578.52]  Squarespace.
[3578.52 --> 3580.52]  Reset. We're out of here.
[3580.52 --> 3581.52]  Later.
[3581.52 --> 3582.52]  Later.
[3582.52 --> 3591.52]  Later.
