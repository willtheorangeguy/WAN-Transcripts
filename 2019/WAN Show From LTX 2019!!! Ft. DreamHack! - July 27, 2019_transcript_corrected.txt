[120.00 → 149.98] Thank you.
[150.00 → 152.00] Thank you.
[152.00 → 157.64] I thought that's my whole shtick, right?
[157.78 → 158.32] The dropping things?
[158.32 → 159.18] I'm trying to become more popular.
[159.34 → 159.80] Yeah, okay.
[160.72 → 163.00] Well, I don't actually think that's the way to do it.
[163.00 → 166.00] Welcome to the...
[166.00 → 167.96] Wow.
[168.64 → 169.80] Is that your stick?
[170.68 → 171.86] Yeah, no, I hope not.
[172.10 → 173.60] Welcome to the Ram Show, guys.
[174.28 → 175.32] Is this all the sponsor stuff?
[175.32 → 177.00] I got sponsor stuff coming out of everywhere.
[177.00 → 178.18] You got sponsors coming out of your butt.
[178.28 → 178.52] Yeah.
[178.52 → 179.52] Yeah.
[179.52 → 179.56] Yeah.
[180.46 → 181.82] Here, do you want to give me your power cord?
[182.20 → 187.42] This is the last minute stuff that you guys don't usually see, but we have to go live now.
[188.34 → 195.74] So we're slightly less late than we otherwise would have been today because we're plugging
[195.74 → 199.64] in Luke's laptop now rather than before the stream.
[200.14 → 202.20] Honestly, compared to normal, this isn't even that late.
[203.46 → 203.86] Okay.
[205.62 → 206.78] Yeah, I know.
[206.78 → 209.44] Oh, boy, my internet died.
[209.56 → 209.92] No, thanks.
[210.02 → 210.12] No.
[210.20 → 210.72] Okay, all good.
[210.72 → 214.14] So we've got a lot of great topics for you guys today.
[214.14 → 219.16] In the news this week, GTA V is a gambling game.
[219.96 → 220.52] What?
[221.54 → 222.92] No, heavens no.
[223.80 → 226.64] Corsair buys Origin PC.
[227.26 → 229.68] What will Corsair not buy next?
[230.36 → 232.82] Apple takes a bite out of Intel.
[233.28 → 235.30] Whatever that means, that's an interesting headline.
[235.46 → 236.62] I wonder who did the doc this week.
[236.62 → 238.10] I legitimately don't know.
[238.50 → 240.52] I'm going to jump down a bunch.
[241.02 → 244.06] It's a user benchmark changes rating system to favour Intel.
[244.20 → 245.02] Oh, my God.
[245.86 → 246.30] Heavens.
[246.42 → 247.66] So go ahead and roll the intro.
[248.60 → 253.44] And hopefully they know what to do because this is sort of.
[253.64 → 254.02] Thank you.
[254.12 → 256.10] Yeah, we have like an actual production crew today.
[256.22 → 259.14] Normally, I would just press it myself, which is why a lot of the time I forget to do it.
[261.14 → 261.46] Are they?
[261.46 → 261.98] Hey!
[262.70 → 263.10] Hey!
[263.10 → 263.46] Hey!

[264.58 → 265.10] Hey!
[265.10 → 265.58] Hey!
[265.58 → 265.62] Hey!
[265.62 → 265.66] Hey!
[265.66 → 265.70] Hey!
[265.70 → 265.74] Hey!
[265.74 → 266.18] Hey!
[266.18 → 266.60] Hey!
[266.60 → 267.14] Medina!
[267.14 → 267.48] Weighed!
[283.80 → 284.40] Thank you.
[284.40 → 285.22] Jehovah's killing.
[285.28 → 285.90] Thank you.
[287.78 → 288.88] One to our locations.
[288.88 → 290.88] Jerky
[295.54 → 297.54] Marinas
[300.48 → 303.66] Wait for it wait for it. It's coming
[312.46 → 314.46] Do we have another one I don't even know
[318.88 → 325.88] All right guys so as most of you have probably figured out from the title of the video
[325.88 → 331.06] We are coming to you live from LTX 2019 featuring Dream hack. This has been absolutely
[332.00 → 338.32] Unbelievable so far at least that's what I'm told all I've really seen is the meet-and-greet area the stage and the bathroom
[338.68 → 343.10] Yeah, and my understanding is I'm actually doing better than you. Have you made it to the bathroom yet? No
[343.10 → 345.10] I
[345.34 → 352.42] Was I was looking for one of my friends in BWC and I made it about a quarter of the way down BWC, and I've been stuck there since 1120 this morning
[352.42 → 356.44] I was like no one's going to care. I don't do videos anymore. Not true
[357.36 → 362.64] Also float plane shirts. We should have probably made about ten times as many as we made really
[366.22 → 372.10] And there's a bunch of people already wearing them. I've had so many people wanting them we have nowhere near enough
[372.10 → 380.24] Oh, that's kind of a shame. Yeah. Meanwhile, we like to cut your t-shirt budget because we kind of figured it would look kind of corporate
[380.24 → 386.48] Yeah, it's kind of corporate does at least we changed the Facebook. Hey, if you're going to shill you might as well look corporate
[387.10 → 389.10] You know great work guys
[392.54 → 398.58] So why don't we jump right into I guess you know what no whole thing with Sancho lately has been that you know
[398.58 → 402.98] We really need to get to the topic that's in the title of the video right away
[403.54 → 407.92] Because you know we got to give the people what they want, but the title of the video is just live from LTX
[407.92 → 412.90] So why don't why don't we do our why don't we do our first super fun thing?
[413.82 → 415.82] right at the beginning and
[416.20 → 418.82] Give away a GeForce RTX 2080
[418.82 → 432.16] So I actually have a really, really tough challenge for you guys
[432.82 → 441.78] I need the first person, and I am relying on you guys to lift your hands real super high and jump and not actually
[441.78 → 447.64] Yeah, but not bull anybody over each other. We've had issues at previous LTX is people bowling each other over okay?
[447.64 → 453.32] I need the first person who has on them now
[454.52 → 459.48] Proof of attendance of LTX 2019 2018 and
[462.02 → 466.84] 2017 all of them all of them you got to have it on you now
[467.32 → 469.96] We have anybody does anybody have it?
[469.96 → 471.96] I see someone pointing
[472.64 → 476.92] But I don't see the actual person with their hands up you got it you got to jump if you're short
[476.92 → 482.76] I see a hand I see a hand okay make your way up here real quick you don't have a lot of time
[482.76 → 485.30] I'm going to put this aside. We're going to go ahead and do wait
[485.30 → 487.34] No, it's got to be on you right now first
[487.34 → 492.42] We called them first, and it's got to be on you right now. All right. Let's go ahead and do our first topic
[492.42 → 495.96] So this is news from BBC. Oh
[496.36 → 499.48] Are you up here you made it okay? All right hit us with it
[499.48 → 502.86] Come on up around okay? You're just you're climbing over the stage
[503.18 → 507.48] You know what? I would do the same thing for an RTX 2080 at this point. You got to show both of us
[507.48 → 511.64] If we don't see it, we need a witness. No, no as long as it's on his phone
[512.30 → 515.24] That's that's it. That's LTX 2017
[515.24 → 517.24] That's 2018
[517.24 → 519.24] Here you are
[519.24 → 521.24] Yay
[521.24 → 523.24] Congrats man
[523.24 → 525.24] Nice to meet you
[525.24 → 529.24] So um
[529.24 → 533.24] Massive shout out to Nvidia for sending over actually a bunch of prizes we're giving away I think it's like I don't know 15 RTX cards or something stupid like that
[533.24 → 539.24] They've got a bunch of monitors guys make sure participation is key and everything here at LTX
[539.24 → 541.24] We're giving away a ton of stuff
[541.24 → 545.24] Speaking of turning LTX tickets into graphics cards
[545.24 → 549.24] GTA 5 is a gambling game. Yeah, so the original article here is from the BBC
[549.24 → 553.24] So basically, we're giving away a ton of stuff
[553.24 → 555.24] So basically, we're giving away a ton of stuff
[555.24 → 557.24] We're giving away a ton of stuff
[557.24 → 559.24] We're giving away a ton of stuff
[559.24 → 561.24] So the original article here is from the BBC
[561.24 → 567.24] So basically in a nutshell if you guys can switch over to my screen for just a second here
[567.24 → 575.24] Grand Theft Auto's Diamond Casino evidently allows cash to be turned into chips
[575.24 → 577.24] Wow
[577.24 → 579.24] So um
[579.24 → 581.24] It used to be gone ahead and switch back to us if you don't mind guys
[581.24 → 585.24] I don't have my own switcher today, so it's going to be a little bank
[585.24 → 587.24] So in other news
[587.24 → 589.24] We've dropped all pretense now
[589.24 → 593.24] So we're not just going to allow people to you know
[593.24 → 599.24] Gamble in the form of loot boxes or other types of microtransactions
[599.24 → 602.24] That you know may or may not have anything worthwhile
[602.24 → 605.24] Or gamble in the form of gun skins or anything like that
[605.24 → 610.24] We're going to let people literally just take their real actual money
[610.24 → 613.24] Convert it to not real, not actual money
[613.24 → 615.24] And then gamble it
[615.24 → 617.24] Use it in a casino that then converts back into cash
[617.24 → 621.24] You know what I've actually experienced this paradigm before
[621.24 → 623.24] It's called Las Vegas
[623.24 → 626.24] I take my I take my Canadian money
[626.24 → 631.24] Okay, I convert it into US dollars which I then convert into chips
[631.24 → 635.24] Okay, then I gamble, and I lose it all
[635.24 → 637.24] I feel like this story's a lie
[637.24 → 639.24] I don't think you actually gamble
[639.24 → 641.24] I gambled one time
[641.24 → 643.24] I've also gambled exactly one time
[643.24 → 645.24] Yeah, and it wasn't actually me
[645.24 → 646.24] It was my wife
[646.24 → 649.24] We were we hadn't we went we actually what you don't know this
[649.24 → 651.24] We went to Vegas for vacation
[651.24 → 653.24] Okay, what?
[653.24 → 655.24] That's actually very surprising
[655.24 → 657.24] I had no idea
[657.24 → 659.24] No offence to anyone from Las Vegas
[659.24 → 661.24] Or who loves Las Vegas
[661.24 → 662.24] I'm not a fan
[662.24 → 663.24] Me neither
[663.24 → 664.24] It doesn't help that every time I go there
[664.24 → 667.24] I'm like run ragged for an entire week
[667.24 → 669.24] I'm always working there
[669.24 → 674.24] But my sister-in-law actually really wanted to take the
[674.24 → 678.24] My niece and nephew and my kids to circus
[678.24 → 681.24] And I was like really?
[681.24 → 682.24] Circus?
[682.24 → 684.24] Would have been my response as well
[684.24 → 686.24] Yeah, you know what? I'm a good sport
[686.24 → 687.24] So I was like
[687.24 → 690.24] Okay, but here's the deal
[690.24 → 692.24] You guys got to watch our kids one night
[692.24 → 693.24] So we can actually go have a night out
[693.24 → 694.24] Sure
[694.24 → 695.24] Because they got a lot of shows there
[695.24 → 696.24] At least they got shows
[696.24 → 698.24] Love musicals, love stage shows
[698.24 → 700.24] So anyway
[700.24 → 702.24] We were out for our night out
[702.24 → 705.24] And we're like well, we're in Las Vegas
[705.24 → 706.24] Let's do something crazy
[706.24 → 709.24] So we converted like a hundred bucks to chips
[709.24 → 710.24] It took us about
[710.24 → 711.24] I'm actually surprised
[711.24 → 713.24] You spent 15 minutes to lose it all
[713.24 → 714.24] On blackjack or something stupid like that
[714.24 → 717.24] Mine was 25 cents, and it took me like 10 seconds
[717.24 → 718.24] Yeah, did you put it in a slot machine?
[718.24 → 719.24] I did
[719.24 → 720.24] Well that's how they get you
[720.24 → 721.24] Yeah
[721.24 → 723.24] That 25 cents is never coming back
[723.24 → 724.24] Yep
[724.24 → 725.24] Gone forever
[725.24 → 727.24] We debriefed after the gambling experience
[727.24 → 730.24] And we were like hey, was that a hundred dollars worth of fun?
[730.24 → 733.24] Well the kids aren't here so that helped a lot
[733.24 → 734.24] So maybe actually
[734.24 → 737.24] But we also could have just done something else
[737.24 → 738.24] Yeah
[738.24 → 739.24] Yeah
[739.24 → 740.24] I think it's kind of weird that
[740.24 → 743.24] In like great game updates of 2019
[743.24 → 745.24] GTA 5 and Poker Stars might be compared
[745.24 → 746.24] I think that's a little odd
[746.24 → 748.24] It's pretty bizarre to me
[748.24 → 749.24] It's very weird
[749.24 → 750.24] I mean I
[750.24 → 753.24] I love how you can't win actual substance
[753.24 → 754.24] Out of gambling your money
[754.24 → 756.24] That's I guess my also favourite part
[756.24 → 757.24] But I
[757.24 → 758.24] That's kind of loot boxes as well
[758.24 → 759.24] But it's just weird that you're like
[759.24 → 761.24] Yeah, I'm going to throw this at a gambling machine
[761.24 → 762.24] And win in-game currency
[762.24 → 764.24] That I could've earned by playing
[764.24 → 765.24] Let me pitch you something
[765.24 → 767.24] Let me pitch you something crazy
[767.24 → 768.24] Okay
[768.24 → 770.24] This is Rockstar
[770.24 → 772.24] Trying to destroy
[772.24 → 774.24] The virtual gambling
[774.24 → 776.24] In-game gambling industry
[776.24 → 778.24] From the inside
[778.24 → 779.24] Interesting
[779.24 → 781.24] They've profited off it like crazy
[781.24 → 782.24] They have profited off
[782.24 → 783.24] But okay
[783.24 → 784.24] Cause that's
[784.24 → 785.24] But this is going to bring more eyes on it
[785.24 → 786.24] Yes
[786.24 → 787.24] 100%
[787.24 → 789.24] That's the only explanation that I can come up with
[789.24 → 792.24] For doing something so spectacularly stupid
[792.24 → 794.24] I hope so
[794.24 → 795.24] I hope so
[795.24 → 796.24] This is the most
[796.24 → 799.24] This is the most egregious flaunting
[799.24 → 800.24] Yeah
[800.24 → 801.24] Of anti, you know
[801.24 → 803.24] Youth gambling laws
[803.24 → 807.24] That anyone has had the balls to take on
[807.24 → 809.24] Then again I guess this is the same company
[809.24 → 811.24] That has made games where you can
[811.24 → 812.24] Have sex with hookers and kill them
[812.24 → 814.24] And you know that kind of stuff
[814.24 → 815.24] It's not like they
[815.24 → 816.24] You know, just everyday things
[816.24 → 817.24] Just everyday things
[817.24 → 818.24] Part of the life
[818.24 → 819.24] You know
[819.24 → 820.24] Yeah
[820.24 → 821.24] Lose all your money
[821.24 → 823.24] And then you have to steal some from the prostitute
[823.24 → 824.24] And then
[824.24 → 825.24] That you just
[825.24 → 826.24] You have to keep your quiet somehow
[826.24 → 828.24] Of course
[829.24 → 830.24] With your car I guess
[830.24 → 831.24] This is just
[831.24 → 832.24] Yeah
[834.24 → 835.24] Okay, now I've thought about this
[835.24 → 838.24] I don't think a car is actually the quietest way to kill someone
[839.24 → 841.24] I'm not exactly great at subtlety
[841.24 → 842.24] So maybe it's
[843.24 → 844.24] Bit of a problem for me
[845.24 → 846.24] Yeah
[846.24 → 847.24] The question in the dock
[847.24 → 848.24] Yeah
[848.24 → 849.24] Is this dangerous?
[849.24 → 850.24] You mentioned the kids' thing
[850.24 → 851.24] The most blatant in the face
[851.24 → 852.24] Of all that kind of stuff
[852.24 → 853.24] Do you think this is dangerous?
[853.24 → 854.24] Bob, what kind of stupid
[854.24 → 855.24] You have to
[855.24 → 856.24] Okay
[856.24 → 857.24] What was driving the conversation forward man?
[857.24 → 860.24] We've actually talked to the people who prepare the WAN show dock
[860.24 → 861.24] We've been like look
[861.24 → 862.24] You guys gotta give us
[862.24 → 865.24] You guys gotta give us topics that there's room for discussion
[865.24 → 867.24] There's like no room for discussion
[867.24 → 869.24] Is shooting someone unhealthy?
[871.24 → 873.24] This is a WAN show topic, let's go
[873.24 → 875.24] Is taking vulnerable people and youth
[876.24 → 886.24] Who already have demonstrated that they don't have the self-control that it takes to not like blow too much money on these online virtual gambling products
[886.24 → 890.24] Is taking those people and making, you know, ramping it up a notch
[891.24 → 892.24] Is that unethical?
[893.24 → 900.24] I can't even devil's advocate this because I don't even know where you would start
[900.24 → 902.24] I just, I just, I'm
[902.24 → 903.24] I'd love to try
[903.24 → 904.24] I just
[904.24 → 906.24] Like for myself, I'll tell you guys right now
[906.24 → 908.24] Like I don't spend money on in-game items
[908.24 → 910.24] I'm trying to think of an example
[910.24 → 911.24] Someone shoot for that
[911.24 → 912.24] Yes
[912.24 → 913.24] No, I did, I did
[913.24 → 915.24] And so much like gambling
[915.24 → 917.24] Disappointed
[917.24 → 918.24] Yeah
[918.24 → 922.24] So, look, guys, everybody makes mistakes once or thrice
[922.24 → 926.24] And I bought a constellation
[926.24 → 928.24] Now that's not, not our shirt
[928.24 → 929.24] Our shirt is awesome
[929.24 → 934.24] I bought that ship from Star Citizen, the constellation
[934.24 → 935.24] Okay, now, now hold on a second
[935.24 → 937.24] I had a business reason for it
[937.24 → 940.24] In fact, I'm fairly certain that I expensed it to Linus Media Group
[940.24 → 950.24] So, I bought, I bought a constellation because our plan was to create like a Star Citizen community
[950.24 → 957.24] Because it looked like it was going to be a sweet game, and I was like, okay, this is going to be like, you know, my way of showing that, you know, I'm in for this
[957.24 → 958.24] And then something, something
[958.24 → 963.24] We were actually, I think the second-largest Star Citizen, like guild or whatever the equivalent
[963.24 → 965.24] I have some fascinating news for you
[965.24 → 968.24] The Star Citizen community is still a thing
[968.24 → 969.24] Wow
[969.24 → 971.24] And you actually owe them a lot more than a constellation
[971.24 → 972.24] Really?
[972.24 → 975.24] Do an agreement that you made on WAN Show in like 2013
[975.24 → 976.24] Oh
[976.24 → 980.24] So, you're going to be spending a lot more on in-game purchases
[980.24 → 985.24] Because what you agreed to was you would spend roughly, I don't think it was roughly
[985.24 → 991.24] I think it was the best ship you could get if it was one dollar per member in the organization
[991.24 → 994.24] And as far as I know, we're currently at over 3,000
[1004.24 → 1007.24] And that is 100% true, I'm gonna, I'm going to try to look this up right now
[1007.24 → 1009.24] Do they have anything stronger than water?
[1011.24 → 1014.24] So yeah, you are totally in on that in-game purchases thing
[1014.24 → 1017.24] You've spent, well, not quite yet, but you're, you will spend
[1017.24 → 1018.24] Thousands of dollars
[1018.24 → 1019.24] Thousands of dollars
[1019.24 → 1023.24] Okay, so naturally, I am very upset about this GTA 5 news
[1026.24 → 1028.24] Look at vulnerable people like me
[1028.24 → 1031.24] And the way that they're wasting money on virtual items
[1033.24 → 1034.24] So I'm looking up right now
[1034.24 → 1037.24] So, okay, it has 2,986 members
[1038.24 → 1039.24] Boom, three grand
[1040.24 → 1044.24] 3,000 cold ones going right to the game that's never going to come out
[1044.24 → 1049.24] Fly now, Alpha 3.6
[1049.24 → 1051.24] Alpha 3.6
[1051.24 → 1052.24] It's like Float plane, wow
[1052.24 → 1054.24] Oh man, you know, it's funny
[1055.24 → 1060.24] We've actually been streaming this whole thing on Float plane, and it's been going great
[1060.24 → 1062.24] And the entire Float plane crew is here, so
[1062.24 → 1063.24] Yeah
[1063.24 → 1064.24] It's cool to hang out with everyone
[1072.24 → 1073.24] Hey!
[1074.24 → 1075.24] Someone just dabbed, seal of approval
[1075.24 → 1080.24] If you guys aren't already on Float plane and you weren't able to make it to LTX
[1080.24 → 1084.24] Guys, make sure you're on Float plane, we're going to have the panels up tomorrow, they're going to be streamed live
[1084.24 → 1088.24] I guess we could also do the Gods from today at some point
[1088.24 → 1091.24] I can't promise when that'll happen, that will not be coming to YouTube though
[1092.24 → 1095.24] Another thing is, if you subscribe to Kyle, BitWitKyle
[1096.24 → 1098.24] You can watch all this content through his live stream as well
[1098.24 → 1101.24] Yeah, you don't have to subscribe to Linus Media Group, somehow Luke negotiated that with me
[1103.24 → 1108.24] So anyone who's here at the show, and who also happens to be on Float plane, you can get hooked up there
[1109.24 → 1110.24] Check it out
[1110.24 → 1115.24] So, you know what, I guess I'm going to throw a wrench at our production crew
[1116.24 → 1119.24] And I would like someone to come up
[1120.24 → 1122.24] Someone, and you have to legitimately believe your position
[1123.24 → 1124.24] Is there anyone in the audience?
[1125.24 → 1127.24] Could we get one of those handheld mics up here at some point?
[1128.24 → 1135.24] Is there anyone out in the audience who legitimately believes that GTA V allowing you to convert real currency to chips
[1135.24 → 1141.24] Gamble with chips in the game where the odds are not properly regulated and cannot be monitored
[1142.24 → 1146.24] And like not satire, not sass, you have to very much personally believe in this
[1147.24 → 1148.24] You have to actually believe that this is okay
[1148.24 → 1150.24] You have to think gambling for kids is wholesome and positive
[1151.24 → 1155.24] And then you have to, and then that you can convert this back into cash and make money
[1155.24 → 1157.24] I really hope no one comes up, but let's see
[1158.24 → 1159.24] Can we get a wide view?
[1159.24 → 1160.24] Oh, we have a hand
[1160.24 → 1161.24] You're smiling too much
[1162.24 → 1163.24] I don't know if I believe you
[1163.24 → 1165.24] He looks like a business guy though, so maybe it's legit
[1166.24 → 1168.24] Alright, get up here loser
[1169.24 → 1170.24] He likes scamming people with money
[1171.24 → 1173.24] You have to come up here, you have to shame for shame
[1174.24 → 1175.24] Come on
[1175.24 → 1176.24] How does it go?
[1178.24 → 1179.24] I'm not shaking his hand
[1180.24 → 1181.24] Yeah
[1181.24 → 1183.24] Nope, alright, defend yourself
[1184.24 → 1185.24] Okay, so
[1186.24 → 1187.24] Mic up, mic up, mic up
[1187.24 → 1188.24] Sorry, just talking to them
[1189.24 → 1192.24] So, kids don't have a lot of money
[1193.24 → 1195.24] But they want to buy a lot of things in GTA
[1196.24 → 1199.24] So they can invest a small amount of money into GTA
[1200.24 → 1202.24] Okay, you're done, you're done, get out of here
[1202.24 → 1203.24] Leave now!
[1207.24 → 1209.24] You have been banished!
[1212.24 → 1214.24] In all seriousness though, you tried real hard
[1215.24 → 1216.24] That was about the best I probably could have come up with too
[1217.24 → 1218.24] Solid attempt
[1219.24 → 1220.24] Alright, so let's move on to our next topic here
[1221.24 → 1222.24] Yeah, we're not even going to address it, everyone knows it's wrong
[1223.24 → 1224.24] Yeah
[1225.24 → 1227.24] So the next big news from this week
[1228.24 → 1230.24] Is Corsair buys Origin PC
[1230.24 → 1231.24] Boom
[1232.24 → 1234.24] And I actually tweeted about this
[1235.24 → 1236.24] When I first heard
[1237.24 → 1241.24] And my...it's one of probably the most honest raw tweets
[1242.24 → 1245.24] That I have ever uploaded on the at Linus Tech handle
[1246.24 → 1248.24] You guys go ahead and switch to my screen if you don't mind, please guys
[1249.24 → 1253.24] So here you go, there's that sick, sick walkway you guys all walked through this morning
[1253.24 → 1254.24] Yeah!
[1255.24 → 1256.24] Except for the BYOC people that have thrown entrance
[1257.24 → 1258.24] Yeah, except for them
[1259.24 → 1260.24] Alright, here we go, where is it, where is it?
[1261.24 → 1263.24] Here's all the shirts people wore to work on Friday
[1264.24 → 1266.24] That was super weird
[1267.24 → 1268.24] What else we got here?
[1269.24 → 1270.24] Come on, the internet's a little slow
[1271.24 → 1272.24] Your Twitter's pretty active, dude
[1272.24 → 1276.24] Yeah, yeah, will I personally handcraft all of these tweets
[1277.24 → 1278.24] Every single...that was weird
[1279.24 → 1280.24] Yeah, that's weird
[1280.24 → 1281.24] That was very weird
[1281.24 → 1282.24] That's super weird
[1282.24 → 1283.24] That threw me off
[1283.24 → 1284.24] Hold on, I'm looking for it, I'm looking for it
[1285.24 → 1286.24] We got this somewhere
[1287.24 → 1288.24] Wow, if you're serious?
[1288.24 → 1289.24] Okay, yeah, here it is
[1289.24 → 1290.24] Right, promoting his own Twitter?
[1290.24 → 1291.24] Here it is, yeah
[1292.24 → 1294.24] So Corsair just bought Origin PC
[1295.24 → 1296.24] Congrats, I guess
[1297.24 → 1299.24] Alright, go ahead and come back to us
[1300.24 → 1302.24] So, um, now, I...
[1303.24 → 1304.24] Okay, I don't...
[1307.24 → 1308.24] I don't know much about the specifics of this deal
[1309.24 → 1310.24] I don't know how much Corsair paid
[1311.24 → 1313.24] I don't know, you know, what Origins books look like
[1314.24 → 1315.24] Some handshakes
[1315.24 → 1318.24] What I will tell you guys is that the system integrator business
[1319.24 → 1321.24] We've had a lot of people ask me over the years
[1322.24 → 1323.24] Hey Linus, you know how to build a computer
[1324.24 → 1325.24] Why don't you build computers for other people?
[1326.24 → 1328.24] You should stop making YouTube videos and just pump them out
[1329.24 → 1332.24] My answer to those people is always
[1333.24 → 1337.24] Because it's a thankless, utterly thankless job
[1338.24 → 1340.24] It's really, really challenging
[1341.24 → 1343.24] Now, if I was going to get into building computers
[1343.24 → 1346.24] I actually met someone from our forum
[1347.24 → 1348.24] Goes by Circle Tech
[1349.24 → 1350.24] And, you know what I'm talking about?
[1351.24 → 1352.24] Yeah, I lurk on the forum a lot, I just don't say anything
[1353.24 → 1356.24] So he actually started a business out of a storage locker of all places
[1357.24 → 1361.24] Buying in bulk, like, throw away slash recycled hardware
[1362.24 → 1363.24] Like a millennial version of a garage
[1364.24 → 1365.24] Yeah, testing it, going through it
[1365.24 → 1366.24] Going through it
[1367.24 → 1369.24] Oh, burn on this generation
[1370.24 → 1372.24] Not being able to afford houses with garages
[1373.24 → 1374.24] Yeah, you have no money, and it's terrible
[1375.24 → 1380.24] Yeah, no cheers
[1381.24 → 1383.24] So he starts this business out of a storage locker
[1384.24 → 1388.24] Buying used hardware, testing it, putting systems together, like validating it
[1388.24 → 1391.24] He's like, yeah, I buy like bags of RAM
[1392.24 → 1394.24] RAM by the bag full
[1395.24 → 1398.24] And the crazy thing about it is it has never been a better time
[1399.24 → 1400.24] To get into a business like that
[1401.24 → 1403.24] Because old hardware actually doesn't suck that much
[1404.24 → 1405.24] Yeah
[1405.24 → 1406.24] It's never time ever
[1406.24 → 1407.24] Yeah
[1407.24 → 1412.24] You can get some, some offices, you know, cast off third gen Core i's
[1413.24 → 1419.24] And you can take those motherboards, clean up those cases, throw some graphics cards in them
[1420.24 → 1426.24] And create a freaking LAN centre for an unprecedentedly, and I have no idea if that's a word, low investment
[1427.24 → 1428.24] It's freaking awesome
[1428.24 → 1429.24] Yeah
[1429.24 → 1430.24] So you turn that stuff around, and you flip it
[1431.24 → 1433.24] Even 5,000 series Intel processors are like, old now
[1433.24 → 1434.24] I know, right?
[1434.24 → 1435.24] And they're sweet
[1435.24 → 1436.24] They're still decent
[1436.24 → 1437.24] I'm running one
[1438.24 → 1439.24] So it's great
[1439.24 → 1443.24] If I was going to get into the system building business, I'd be doing that
[1444.24 → 1446.24] Corsair, on the other hand
[1447.24 → 1450.24] Corsair, on the other hand, they bought Origin
[1452.24 → 1456.24] So now to be clear, we've had some great experiences with Origin
[1457.24 → 1459.24] They were expensive during Secret Shopper
[1459.24 → 1463.24] But their system quality and their customer service were both excellent
[1464.24 → 1469.24] But that kind of ties back to why I was saying it is such a thankless and difficult business
[1470.24 → 1473.24] Because the business of just building PCs is easy
[1474.24 → 1476.24] The business of supporting them after the fact
[1477.24 → 1479.24] That is really, really hard
[1480.24 → 1482.24] And it's often a big part of the sell, so you're expected to do that
[1482.24 → 1485.24] You're expected to maintain this thing for a long time
[1485.24 → 1487.24] And especially if you're someone like Origin
[1487.24 → 1489.24] You're building like, water cooled systems
[1489.24 → 1492.24] Or crazy stuff like the big O tower
[1493.24 → 1495.24] Which has got, what, a PS4, an Xbox One X
[1496.24 → 1498.24] And a gaming PC in it, all water cooled
[1499.24 → 1500.24] And a Switch
[1501.24 → 1502.24] Did they water cool the Switch?
[1502.24 → 1503.24] It's got a little hidden Switch, I don't think so
[1503.24 → 1505.24] Oh, okay, a hidden Switch, I get it, that's funny
[1506.24 → 1507.24] Yeah, it's cute
[1510.24 → 1514.24] So I guess my take on this, my very honest take is
[1514.24 → 1516.24] I don't understand why Corsair wanted them
[1517.24 → 1518.24] Yeah, no, I, yeah
[1519.24 → 1521.24] Origin's cool, I kind of knew they would do well in the contest
[1522.24 → 1523.24] So I've communicated with them a bunch
[1523.24 → 1524.24] And I was like, yeah, they care a lot
[1524.24 → 1525.24] Cool guys
[1525.24 → 1526.24] Probably alright, yeah, exactly
[1527.24 → 1530.24] But, yeah, a little bit of a weird purchase
[1530.24 → 1533.24] But, to be fair, Corsair's been trying to build their own systems for a bit now
[1534.24 → 1535.24] Yeah, so why didn't they just do that?
[1536.24 → 1537.24] Maybe they wanted the people
[1538.24 → 1539.24] Okay, alright
[1540.24 → 1541.24] So, okay, alright, fine
[1542.24 → 1545.24] It might have been like a staffing purchase to a certain degree
[1546.24 → 1548.24] That's a fascinating take on it
[1549.24 → 1550.24] Yeah, I can't, I can't
[1550.24 → 1551.24] I have no idea
[1551.24 → 1552.24] This is like a weird, off, potential
[1553.24 → 1554.24] No, wait, I've got it
[1555.24 → 1556.24] Corsair
[1557.24 → 1558.24] Is evil
[1560.24 → 1561.24] Corsair
[1561.24 → 1562.24] Is driven
[1563.24 → 1564.24] Not by
[1565.24 → 1566.24] Not by motivations that we understand
[1566.24 → 1567.24] By getting kids to gamble
[1567.24 → 1568.24] No, not by that
[1569.24 → 1572.24] So Corsair is driven not by motivations that we understand
[1573.24 → 1574.24] Like, like money
[1575.24 → 1576.24] Or prestige
[1577.24 → 1578.24] Or adoration
[1579.24 → 1580.24] Anything
[1580.24 → 1583.24] Corsair is driven by this deep, baser urge
[1584.24 → 1586.24] To simply conquer everything
[1586.24 → 1588.24] Because if you think about it
[1589.24 → 1591.24] What freaking category are they not in?
[1592.24 → 1595.24] Corsair couldn't stop at allowing you to buy their, your memory
[1596.24 → 1597.24] Your power supply
[1598.24 → 1599.24] Your case, you're cabling
[1600.24 → 1602.24] Your peripherals, your, what else?
[1603.24 → 1605.24] You're cooling, your other more different cooling
[1606.24 → 1607.24] Yeah
[1607.24 → 1608.24] Yeah
[1608.24 → 1609.24] Yeah
[1609.24 → 1614.24] You're lighting, it wasn't enough that you could build an entire system out of Corsair
[1615.24 → 1618.24] No, now Corsair actually has to build the system for you
[1619.24 → 1624.24] That way they can absolutely guarantee that you didn't buy anything from anyone else
[1625.24 → 1626.24] All from that
[1626.24 → 1627.24] Wow
[1628.24 → 1629.24] So yeah, that's pretty much all I can
[1629.24 → 1630.24] It could be like a Google style purchase too
[1630.24 → 1631.24] That's all I can come up with
[1631.24 → 1633.24] They're a custom-building, so I might be buying them to just like, shut them down
[1634.24 → 1636.24] Maybe next time I meet with their CEO
[1636.24 → 1638.24] I should just be like, do you want to buy a Linus Media Group?
[1639.24 → 1641.24] It's the one thing you don't own yet
[1642.24 → 1644.24] A good YouTube channel
[1644.24 → 1645.24] I mean they try
[1646.24 → 1647.24] They try, they try
[1648.24 → 1649.24] No, no, okay
[1650.24 → 1651.24] Applause for their effort
[1652.24 → 1653.24] Good try Corsair
[1653.24 → 1654.24] You want to hear something bad?
[1654.24 → 1655.24] Yeah
[1655.24 → 1656.24] I had no idea they had a YouTube channel
[1657.24 → 1658.24] It's mostly like tutorials and stuff
[1658.24 → 1659.24] They try, you know, they try
[1659.24 → 1661.24] You remember the this is kinda off-topic
[1661.24 → 1662.24] Remember the they're actually here
[1663.24 → 1665.24] Remember the MSI computer building tutorials
[1666.24 → 1667.24] From like, way back?
[1667.24 → 1668.24] You're not talking like the skimpy one, right?
[1669.24 → 1670.24] Yeah
[1671.24 → 1672.24] Quality YouTube tutorials
[1673.24 → 1674.24] Little bit better than The Verge still
[1675.24 → 1678.24] Just saying
[1679.24 → 1680.24] Okay
[1681.24 → 1682.24] Ouch
[1683.24 → 1684.24] Apple Intel?
[1685.24 → 1686.24] Yeah, why don't we talk about that?
[1686.24 → 1693.24] So, you know, one of the one of the things that, you know, everyone loves to speculate about year after year
[1694.24 → 1702.24] Is that, Apple is going to move away from using Intel processors, you know, whatever, whatever type they are
[1703.24 → 1710.24] So, famously, Apple actually didn't use to use x86 processors in their desktop and laptop computers
[1710.24 → 1722.24] And it was kind of a big deal for the industry when Apple decided to make Mac and Windows effectively intercompatible so that you were able to, they introduced boot camps so you could actually run Windows on your Mac and that was all cool
[1723.24 → 1738.24] And pretty much since the moment that happened, since the moment they switched to Intel, speculation has been everywhere that they're going to abandon Intel, whether it was going back to, you know, IBM Power or whether it was the ongoing trend of, you know, the
[1738.24 → 1750.24] the ongoing trend of power efficient architectures like ARM becoming closer and closer and closer to the bottom end of the x86 processor stack from companies like Intel or AMD
[1750.24 → 1755.24] There's always been kind of this, the speculation that Apple's going to, they're going to switch
[1755.24 → 1759.24] And personally, I think we're actually finally getting close to that
[1759.24 → 1767.24] But one of the more novel ways that Apple can stop buying processors from other companies is to just buy their entire division that designs processors
[1767.24 → 1783.24] So Apple famously switched to an Intel modem for, was it iPhone X or iPhone XS? I'm sorry, it's failing me now, but it's either iPhone X or XS. Can anyone help me out?
[1783.24 → 1785.24] Yeah, was it the 7 they switched to Intel?
[1785.24 → 1786.24] Really?
[1786.24 → 1787.24] They had both
[1787.24 → 1796.24] They had, okay, they had both. Okay. So more recently, Intel and Qualcomm have had some, some disagreements over, and they're going to be able to do that.
[1796.24 → 1807.24] They had both of the same problems over, especially 5G modem tech, and Apple is apparently coming in to take that big load of liability off of Intel's hands for the cool price of a billion dollars.
[1807.24 → 1808.24] Solid.
[1808.24 → 1811.24] So it looks like pretty much
[1811.24 → 1812.24] Maybe Apple should buy Lenspegroom?
[1812.24 → 1814.24] Yeah, maybe Apple should buy Lenspegroom?
[1814.24 → 1815.24] I don't think they would.
[1815.24 → 1818.24] I think they'd be super not into our style.
[1818.24 → 1819.24] Yeah, probably.
[1819.24 → 1837.24] So it looks like from Apple's standpoint, Qualcomm is basically the worst. They're not that into a monopoly dictating who can or cannot buy 5G modems for cellular phones and hotspots and all that kind of stuff.
[1837.24 → 1842.24] And they don't want a monopoly dictating how much they're going to have to pay for them.
[1842.24 → 1852.24] So, given that Intel's modem business has been struggling, this looks like it might be a good move, I guess?
[1852.24 → 1858.24] Makes sense to me, to be completely honest. Intel doesn't necessarily want that segment if it's been struggling for a long time.
[1858.24 → 1862.24] And since it's been struggling mightily in the dock, might I add.
[1862.24 → 1863.24] Yeah.
[1863.24 → 1866.24] So if they're struggling that hard selling it for a billion dollars, eh.
[1866.24 → 1868.24] Especially when they've got a lot of other pressure on them right now.
[1868.24 → 1869.24] Intel's a-
[1869.24 → 1870.24] They're trying to dive into GPU.
[1870.24 → 1872.24] AMD's like nom.
[1872.24 → 1876.24] They're a funny company to me because they seem to kind of do this, right?
[1876.24 → 1881.24] Where they'll, you know, their X-Scale processors are another great example of this.
[1881.24 → 1886.24] Where they kind of, in that case, it seems like they were sort of ahead of the curve.
[1886.24 → 1890.24] So there's actually a video coming on the Linus Tech Tips channel.
[1890.24 → 1894.24] We used a chunk of it for our editing den challenge here at LTX.
[1894.24 → 1899.24] So we, that's the only reason it's not released yet because I filmed it like a couple of weeks ago.
[1899.24 → 1903.24] But I actually dug out of my attic my old pack.
[1903.24 → 1906.24] Not to be confused with an iPad.
[1906.24 → 1907.24] Yeah, yeah.
[1907.24 → 1908.24] So do you know what an pack is?
[1908.24 → 1912.24] I heard the name but actually no, not really.
[1912.24 → 1914.24] Alright, let's show everyone.
[1914.24 → 1916.24] I'll try and find the exact one.
[1916.24 → 1917.24] If you guys can fire up my screen here.
[1917.24 → 1918.24] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1918.24 → 1919.24] There we go.
[1919.24 → 1920.24] Awesome.
[1920.24 → 1925.24] So I'm going to try and find the model that I had.
[1925.24 → 1927.24] I think this is actually it.
[1927.24 → 1935.24] So this thing actually had, this is way before, you know, the iPhone completely took mobile computing by storm.
[1935.24 → 1939.24] To a lesser extent the iPad.
[1939.24 → 1945.24] This thing had an arm powered 500 megahertz Intel X scale processor in it.
[1945.24 → 1947.24] And they bailed.
[1947.24 → 1948.24] If you can come back to us.
[1948.24 → 1949.24] Thanks guys.
[1949.24 → 1951.24] And they bailed on this thing.
[1951.24 → 1957.24] And it feels like they, they just kind of can't get the timing right sometimes.
[1957.24 → 1958.24] Yeah.
[1958.24 → 1964.24] They, they, from what I've heard from talking to people.
[1964.24 → 1965.24] Sources.
[1965.24 → 1966.24] Yeah.
[1966.24 → 1967.24] Sources say.
[1967.24 → 1970.24] Some of the higher ups at Intel just really have no idea what they even make.
[1970.24 → 1973.24] So like, I'm not even kidding.
[1973.24 → 1975.24] This is, I've heard this from more than one person.
[1975.24 → 1980.24] And like people have had to go in and explain to them like, this is why people like your things.
[1980.24 → 1981.24] And want to buy them.
[1981.24 → 1985.24] So like maybe that causes some of the timing problems.
[1985.24 → 1986.24] Right.
[1986.24 → 1990.24] So that's where you end up, you know, hearing something like, IOT.
[1990.24 → 1992.24] Or AI.
[1992.24 → 1995.24] And you just like, you just like start furiously building stuff.
[1995.24 → 1996.24] Yeah.
[1996.24 → 2000.24] And then you end up having to sell it for a fraction of what you spent on it.
[2000.24 → 2001.24] You know, 5G.
[2001.24 → 2002.24] Yeah.
[2002.24 → 2003.24] Yeah.
[2003.24 → 2004.24] Yeah.
[2004.24 → 2007.24] It's kind of unfortunate, but you know.
[2007.24 → 2008.24] Yeah.
[2008.24 → 2009.24] I wish them luck with that.
[2009.24 → 2010.24] So.
[2010.24 → 2011.24] I think this could be a good move for Apple though.
[2011.24 → 2012.24] I'm down.
[2012.24 → 2013.24] Speaking of a good move.
[2013.24 → 2014.24] Especially with Apple making.
[2014.24 → 2017.24] It would be a great move for us to talk about our sponsors for the show today.
[2017.24 → 2018.24] Oh my.
[2018.24 → 2020.24] Savage Jerky first.
[2020.24 → 2021.24] Yeah.
[2021.24 → 2023.24] I don't know if I'm going to do.
[2023.24 → 2025.24] Should we get a fan to eat some ghost pepper?
[2025.24 → 2026.24] I think that's a very nice thing to do.
[2026.24 → 2027.24] Alright.
[2027.24 → 2032.24] I'm having some mojo habanero though.
[2032.24 → 2036.24] I'm going for hot instead of like, what is that?
[2036.24 → 2037.24] 4 or 5 alarm?
[2037.24 → 2038.24] Just very hot.
[2038.24 → 2039.24] It's on the back.
[2039.24 → 2040.24] Oh.
[2040.24 → 2041.24] That's a level 4.
[2041.24 → 2042.24] What's higher than this?
[2042.24 → 2044.24] This is level 3, apparently.
[2044.24 → 2045.24] Carolina Reaper.
[2045.24 → 2046.24] Yeah.
[2046.24 → 2047.24] I think the Reaper one is actually hotter than that one.
[2047.24 → 2048.24] I'll do it.
[2048.24 → 2049.24] You're going to do it?
[2049.24 → 2050.24] Yeah.
[2050.24 → 2051.24] Alright.
[2051.24 → 2052.24] Oh.
[2052.24 → 2056.24] It just punched me in the face.
[2056.24 → 2057.24] Even the smell.
[2057.24 → 2059.24] Savage Jerky.
[2059.24 → 2060.24] My dad's here.
[2060.24 → 2061.24] I can't be a wimp.
[2061.24 → 2063.24] He'd eat this whole bag and be like, whatever.
[2063.24 → 2064.24] I don't care.
[2064.24 → 2067.24] I am all that is man.
[2067.24 → 2073.24] Savage Jerky set out to create a snack with the best ingredients without nitrates or preservatives.
[2073.24 → 2078.24] And the goal was to create a snack that's full of flavour and spice and that isn't bad for you.
[2078.24 → 2079.24] They've got...
[2079.24 → 2080.24] Oh no.
[2080.24 → 2081.24] You guys don't have to put that up.
[2081.24 → 2082.24] It's fine.
[2082.24 → 2083.24] There's a lower third.
[2083.24 → 2084.24] Oh.
[2084.24 → 2085.24] Okay.
[2085.24 → 2086.24] You know what?
[2086.24 → 2087.24] Maybe put that up because I don't think we have a lower third.
[2087.24 → 2088.24] Cool.
[2088.24 → 2091.24] They've got 13 different flavours of jerky like sriracha bacon and maple buffalo bacon.
[2091.24 → 2092.24] That...
[2092.24 → 2094.24] The last one is my personal favourite.
[2094.24 → 2096.24] They also make barbecue sauce, hot sauce and a spice rub.
[2096.24 → 2100.24] And their Carolina Reaper hot sauce uses one of the hottest peppers in the world.
[2100.24 → 2102.24] The Carolina Reaper.

[2126.24 → 2127.24] I think they've all seen the offer code.
[2127.24 → 2128.24] Thanks.
[2128.24 → 2134.24] Sweet and creamy flavours like mocha or caramel or bold flavours like their cold brew black.
[2134.24 → 2135.24] Oh, you know what?
[2135.24 → 2136.24] The mojo habanero is pretty hot too.
[2136.24 → 2137.24] That's a three.
[2137.24 → 2138.24] So I will...
[2138.24 → 2139.24] Okay.
[2139.24 → 2140.24] You know what?
[2140.24 → 2141.24] I'm going to have a ghost too.
[2141.24 → 2142.24] Terrifying.
[2142.24 → 2144.24] We actually have a permanent item on their e-store.
[2144.24 → 2147.24] The Lamb coffee beans roast, which is right here.
[2147.24 → 2152.24] And also our limited edition café vanilla cold brew can, which is right here.
[2152.24 → 2153.24] You can actually get...
[2153.24 → 2156.24] I get people tweeting me this all the time because they...
[2156.24 → 2158.24] You can buy it at micro centre, apparently.
[2158.24 → 2159.24] Yeah.
[2159.24 → 2160.24] Yeah.
[2160.24 → 2161.24] Wow.
[2161.24 → 2163.24] We got a lot of love for micro centre here.
[2163.24 → 2164.24] All right.
[2164.24 → 2165.24] Well, that's cool.
[2165.24 → 2168.24] But yeah, the people are always like, LOL.
[2168.24 → 2170.24] I look what I found at micro centre.
[2170.24 → 2171.24] Really?
[2171.24 → 2172.24] Oh, okay.
[2172.24 → 2173.24] Cool.

[2186.24 → 2188.24] You can answer any questions through direct message.
[2188.24 → 2191.24] One thing about what Linus said, the mojo habanero thing is actually pretty hot.
[2191.24 → 2192.24] They're indicators.
[2192.24 → 2196.24] Like when they say this one's very hot, that one's hot, this one's mild.
[2196.24 → 2197.24] Like they're actually pretty accurate.
[2197.24 → 2198.24] Okay.
[2198.24 → 2199.24] You're doing it?
[2199.24 → 2202.24] There's a solid chance that you're going to have to do the FreshBooks spot.
[2202.24 → 2203.24] Oh boy.
[2203.24 → 2204.24] How much did you eat?
[2204.24 → 2205.24] Did you eat an entire strip?
[2205.24 → 2206.24] I did, but it was smaller than that.
[2206.24 → 2209.24] I'm just being honest.
[2217.24 → 2219.24] Sheer determination.
[2219.24 → 2221.24] Wish I had milk.
[2221.24 → 2223.24] Where is the FreshBooks spot?
[2223.24 → 2226.24] You've got water, which won't help at all.
[2226.24 → 2228.24] FreshBooks is a super simple, easy to use invoicing tool.
[2228.24 → 2231.24] It does more than just creating slick looking invoices.
[2231.24 → 2236.24] It helps you track your time with their just staring right at the camera.
[2236.24 → 2238.24] Helps you manage your expenses, keep track of who owes you what.
[2238.24 → 2242.24] It has a mobile app with all the functionality of their desktop app, which is very cool.
[2242.24 → 2245.24] And you can call their support staff to talk to a real human right away.
[2245.24 → 2249.24] No robots, just directly to a person, which is great.
[2249.24 → 2251.24] Especially when you're running a business.
[2251.24 → 2252.24] You might need someone very, very quickly.
[2252.24 → 2257.24] Visit freshbooks.com forward slash wan and enter wan in how did you hear about us section.
[2268.24 → 2270.24] You're doing pretty good, because you're not super into spice.
[2270.24 → 2272.24] You know what I actually, no I love spice.
[2272.24 → 2273.24] Oh okay.
[2273.24 → 2274.24] But to a point.
[2274.24 → 2275.24] Yeah.
[2275.24 → 2277.24] Like the five, the five, whatever they're called.
[2277.24 → 2279.24] The Carolina one is actually terrifying.
[2279.24 → 2281.24] That one is really, really spicy.
[2281.24 → 2283.24] And honestly, I kind of cheated.
[2283.24 → 2287.24] Because eating a mojo habanero before you have the ghost pepper gets you kind of warmed up.
[2287.24 → 2289.24] With that said, I could use a drink.
[2289.24 → 2295.24] Alright, we've got a couple of other topics for today, which maybe we'll get to at some point.
[2295.24 → 2297.24] But like, how was your week?
[2297.24 → 2298.24] I mean, it's been pretty good.
[2298.24 → 2299.24] It's been pretty good.
[2299.24 → 2302.24] It's been fascinating having all the float plane people here.
[2302.24 → 2307.24] There's actually a significant amount of people that came that I've never met before.
[2307.24 → 2308.24] So that was cool.
[2308.24 → 2309.24] Also...
[2309.24 → 2310.24] I mean, I'm not sure how the world.
[2310.24 → 2312.24] The new guy is six foot eight.
[2312.24 → 2315.24] You're not the tallest one on the team?
[2315.24 → 2316.24] Not even close.
[2316.24 → 2318.24] Okay, Jaden's slightly taller than me.
[2318.24 → 2319.24] But like, he's a giant.
[2319.24 → 2321.24] So you're like average.
[2321.24 → 2322.24] Yeah.
[2322.24 → 2323.24] Wow.
[2323.24 → 2324.24] What's that like for you?
[2324.24 → 2325.24] What the heck?
[2325.24 → 2326.24] Terrible.
[2326.24 → 2328.24] He like doesn't fit in my car.
[2328.24 → 2331.24] I was like, okay, this is unfair.
[2331.24 → 2334.24] First, I've only seen you on a webcam, and you were sitting.
[2334.24 → 2336.24] I need you to go back and become shorter.
[2336.24 → 2338.24] Because this is like, this is not great.
[2338.24 → 2340.24] So yeah, I guess that's a thing now.
[2340.24 → 2342.24] I'm not tall at float plane.
[2344.24 → 2345.24] I don't know what the heck happened there.
[2345.24 → 2350.24] And then the live-streaming, I mean live-streaming on float plane, you know, hasn't been that great.
[2350.24 → 2353.24] But this event had a bunch of upgrades.
[2353.24 → 2354.24] AJ's been working on it tirelessly.
[2354.24 → 2357.24] And from what I've heard, people are pretty happy with it so far.
[2357.24 → 2359.24] So that's really exciting.
[2359.24 → 2360.24] That's pretty exciting.
[2360.24 → 2361.24] I thought it was great.
[2361.24 → 2377.24] Float plane is going to be spending the next week hanging out at the Linus Media Group offices and discussing like the future roadmap and like tons of like big, deep meeting stuff that we need to do.
[2377.24 → 2381.24] So hopefully there should be some cool news about what we're going to be working on in the future very soon.
[2381.24 → 2384.24] Yeah, that's basically what you've been telling me for the last two and a half years.
[2384.24 → 2385.24] Yeah, it works pretty well.
[2385.24 → 2387.24] Hey boy, I need some more money.
[2387.24 → 2388.24] Yeah.
[2388.24 → 2391.24] You want to fund my project?
[2391.24 → 2396.24] Oh man, I still can't believe how many people are here this year.
[2396.24 → 2397.24] This is wild.
[2397.24 → 2398.24] Honestly.
[2398.24 → 2400.24] Thank you all for coming!
[2403.24 → 2407.24] Like look, look, they can even pan the camera.
[2411.24 → 2425.24] Like when we were creating promotional imagery for LTX based on past events, we always had to kind of like pick a great angle and like crop it to make it look like the crowd was really dense.
[2425.24 → 2429.92] really dense and like, you know, there were so many people there because it was only about
[2429.92 → 2435.48] a third of the size, and it was only one day. And we were like, yeah, like it was cool.
[2435.48 → 2440.24] It was awesome. It was incredible. It was like nothing we'd ever done before, but we
[2440.24 → 2443.36] were novices, you know, we had never really done anything like that before.
[2443.36 → 2443.86] Yeah.
[2443.86 → 2448.86] So that's why it was like nothing we'd ever done before. You know, this year I actually,
[2448.86 → 2450.74] so you went, you walked the line too.
[2450.74 → 2451.74] Yes.
[2451.74 → 2452.74] Yeah. Did you time it?
[2452.74 → 2453.74] No.
[2453.74 → 2457.30] I also noticed it didn't just go like, okay, so for perspective for you guys, I didn't
[2457.30 → 2461.56] time it, and he's going to tell you a time in a second, and it's wild, but you had to, it
[2461.56 → 2466.24] went all the way down the entire run of the convention centre, out of the convention centre,
[2466.24 → 2470.74] around a corner, back on a different corner, down the street and down another street.
[2470.74 → 2473.80] And like, that's not exaggerating, and it was packed.
[2473.80 → 2476.80] Now I did get slowed down a little bit. Like people wanted to high five and stuff.
[2476.80 → 2478.30] But you were cruising because I lost you.
[2478.30 → 2480.80] But I was moving pretty good. It took me seven minutes.
[2480.80 → 2481.80] Yeah.
[2481.80 → 2486.80] I was walking the entire line, all the like the three different lines. It was absolutely
[2486.80 → 2488.80] nuts. So you guys having a good time so far?
[2488.80 → 2489.62] Yeah.
[2489.62 → 2490.62] All right.
[2490.62 → 2491.62] All right.
[2491.62 → 2492.62] All right.
[2492.62 → 2505.62] So far feedback seems to be amazing. Everyone seems to be super happy. Dream hack has been
[2505.62 → 2506.62] great.
[2506.62 → 2510.62] really nice to work with. They're doing a thing, a new event or something.
[2510.62 → 2515.62] Oh yeah. I heard they, oh shoot, I forget what city it is. Yeah? Anaheim? Oh, yeah.
[2515.62 → 2518.62] Yeah. I think Dream hack's doing Anaheim now. So there you go. If you're a...
[2518.62 → 2521.62] No one knows that except for you. Yeah. Yeah.
[2521.62 → 2523.62] All you people on the internet. Yeah.
[2523.62 → 2528.62] So I have something that's really exciting for me. Okay. So I've had an issue with my
[2528.62 → 2532.62] gaming setup. I don't know if I actually told you this, but you know how I've got my, my
[2532.62 → 2536.62] Thunderbolt cables running through the wall, and then I've got like my rack mount gaming
[2536.62 → 2538.62] system, and then I've got a separate one for my wife. Right?
[2538.62 → 2545.62] Yes. And then the whole idea is that using Thunderbolt 2, I can just go to a single dock
[2545.62 → 2552.62] and then I can get around some of the limitations that USB 3 has with respect to signal integrity
[2552.62 → 2559.62] and cable length because Thunderbolt is taking the signal optically over the long haul distance
[2559.62 → 2563.62] and then I can plug everything else into short distance hubs and everything actually works
[2563.62 → 2568.62] really amazing. So I tried to upgrade my machine a little while ago, and I've done a couple of videos on
[2568.62 → 2574.62] it already. And I went, and I accidentally upgraded myself out of being able to use my computer.
[2574.62 → 2583.62] Bit of a funny story. So in the video, I put in this Horus pre-water cooled 9900K like super ball
[2583.62 → 2589.62] in motherboard combo thing. It comes with like a pre-binned 5.1 gigahertz chip. It's like super sick.
[2589.62 → 2590.62] That's cool.
[2590.62 → 2597.62] And then I realized that it doesn't have Thunderbolt 2, which means that I can't connect to my dock.
[2597.62 → 2603.62] And also I was like, hey, but surely those Thunderbolt 3 optical cables that Corning said they were working on
[2603.62 → 2607.62] a couple of years ago. Surely those have come to market yet.
[2607.62 → 2611.62] Turns out that they haven't.
[2611.62 → 2612.62] Yikes.
[2612.62 → 2618.62] So that wouldn't be that much of a problem because all I did was swap my old motherboard back in except for one thing.
[2618.62 → 2627.62] They're Thunderbolt 2 cables. And I thought for the longest time that it was just me because I've had a few of them die.
[2627.62 → 2639.62] Their Thunderbolt 2 cables had an issue with heat dump from the port heating up the laser diodes and like misaligning them.
[2639.62 → 2640.62] So they break.
[2640.62 → 2641.62] Yeah.
[2641.62 → 2646.62] So out of the like five or six of them that either Corning sent or that I bought.
[2646.62 → 2649.62] So there's a there's a combination there. Only one is actually working.
[2649.62 → 2658.62] So my wife and I can only have either mine or her computer working at a time right now until Corning releases optical Thunderbolt 3 cables.
[2658.62 → 2666.62] So I emailed them and I was like, hey, how's that going? And they couldn't tell me really anything.
[2666.62 → 2671.62] And they said that I really couldn't talk about anything that they couldn't tell me.
[2671.62 → 2677.62] But while I was doing the tours of the office on Friday, I found a box.
[2677.62 → 2681.62] I found a box from Corning on the received items' shelf.
[2681.62 → 2685.62] So I'm like super stoked because I think it's finally time for me to upgrade my rig.
[2685.62 → 2686.62] Nice.
[2686.62 → 2689.62] Because for years you've actually had a way better gaming system than me.
[2689.62 → 2690.62] Yeah.
[2690.62 → 2692.62] Which I guess makes sense because you actually play video games.
[2692.62 → 2693.62] That does help. That does help.
[2693.62 → 2697.62] Although I was going to say I find your computer woes kind of hilarious.
[2697.62 → 2700.62] Because you're like the man computer wise.
[2700.62 → 2703.62] And you go home, and you're like, I can't play Anna.
[2703.62 → 2706.62] I can't play video game.
[2706.62 → 2707.62] Please help.
[2707.62 → 2708.62] Well I need a really...
[2708.62 → 2710.62] Upgrade my computer. Oh, no. It doesn't work.
[2710.62 → 2713.62] Oh no. I need a really special cable because I have a really weird setup.
[2713.62 → 2715.62] Yeah, it's kind of cool. I will give you that.
[2715.62 → 2718.62] Maybe I should just build a normal computer. Is that what I should do?
[2718.62 → 2721.62] No. No. No. No. I completely disagree.
[2721.62 → 2722.62] You should do something crazy.
[2722.62 → 2724.62] Completely disagree with that.
[2724.62 → 2726.62] You know I actually have...
[2726.62 → 2727.62] Of course.
[2727.62 → 2730.62] I have kind of a cool idea for something that I want to do.
[2730.62 → 2733.62] And it makes no sense. And I have no idea where I'd put it.
[2733.62 → 2734.62] Heck yeah.
[2734.62 → 2735.62] So yeah, we're off to a good start, right?
[2735.62 → 2736.62] Yes.
[2736.62 → 2737.62] So you know...
[2737.62 → 2738.62] This is what I want.
[2738.62 → 2739.62] You know how I did...
[2739.62 → 2740.62] Going back...
[2740.62 → 2741.62] Way back...
[2741.62 → 2742.62] Two gamers, one CPU, right?
[2742.62 → 2743.62] Okay, yeah.
[2743.62 → 2744.62] Okay.
[2744.62 → 2745.62] So...
[2745.62 → 2746.62] And remember how I did...
[2746.62 → 2749.62] Two spreadsheet users, one computer in a different room.
[2749.62 → 2751.62] Yeah, really close, but not at all.
[2751.62 → 2752.62] Okay.
[2752.62 → 2753.62] Okay.
[2753.62 → 2757.62] So remember the project where I created a window out of a TV?
[2757.62 → 2758.62] Yeah.
[2758.62 → 2759.62] I mean, really I didn't do anything.
[2759.62 → 2761.62] I mounted a TV to a wall.
[2761.62 → 2762.62] But inside the wall.
[2762.62 → 2763.62] It looked nice.
[2763.62 → 2764.62] It looked different.
[2764.62 → 2765.62] Okay.
[2765.62 → 2766.62] So imagine this.
[2766.62 → 2769.62] And again, I have no idea where I would put it.
[2769.62 → 2770.62] But it's like...
[2770.62 → 2771.62] Hey.
[2771.62 → 2772.62] Oh, hi.
[2772.62 → 2775.62] Intel wants to be part of the fun.
[2775.62 → 2776.62] Intel wants...
[2776.62 → 2777.62] Hello?
[2777.62 → 2778.62] Uh...
[2778.62 → 2779.62] Check.
[2779.62 → 2780.62] Uh...
[2780.62 → 2783.62] Intel wants to be a part of the fun too.
[2783.62 → 2784.62] So...
[2784.62 → 2785.62] Have fun.
[2785.62 → 2790.62] All right.
[2790.62 → 2797.62] This is a really cool package.
[2797.62 → 2802.62] So you guys might not know this, but the main stage here at LTX is sponsored by Intel.
[2802.62 → 2806.62] And apparently that includes throwing processors at us.
[2806.62 → 2807.62] So...
[2807.62 → 2812.62] I hadn't actually premeditated anything to challenge you guys with.
[2812.62 → 2815.62] So I'm going to put this aside very briefly.
[2815.62 → 2816.62] I'm going to finish my story.
[2816.62 → 2817.62] Something that I almost never do.
[2817.62 → 2818.62] This is very unusual.
[2818.62 → 2820.62] I'm going to complete my story.
[2820.62 → 2821.62] And then I'm going to come up with something.
[2821.62 → 2825.62] So this is a Core i9 9900K.
[2825.62 → 2828.62] This is basically as good as it gets for a gaming experience.
[2828.62 → 2830.62] And we are going to be giving it away in a short amount.
[2830.62 → 2832.62] I've never actually seen the retail packaging for this in person.
[2832.62 → 2833.62] Really?
[2833.62 → 2838.62] Yeah, because all the engineering samples and stuff that they send us for review ahead of time,
[2838.62 → 2840.62] they just come in like a little black styrofoam thing.
[2840.62 → 2842.62] I thought they'd send you one of these as like a demo thing or something.
[2842.62 → 2843.62] I don't know.
[2843.62 → 2844.62] It's possible.
[2844.62 → 2847.62] I mean, Anthony does all of our CPU benchmarking now, so maybe I just never got to see it.
[2847.62 → 2850.62] I just reviewed the script with him and all that kind of stuff.
[2850.62 → 2851.62] Makes sense.
[2851.62 → 2853.62] I just built two systems with these in Chicago.
[2853.62 → 2854.62] Oh, really?
[2854.62 → 2856.62] The packaging is actually fantastic.
[2856.62 → 2857.62] Yeah, it's really cool.
[2857.62 → 2858.62] How does it come apart?
[2858.62 → 2862.62] Okay, so there's authentication stickers to show that it's like really actually Intel.
[2862.62 → 2863.62] In multiple places.
[2863.62 → 2864.62] Here's one of them.
[2864.62 → 2866.62] So we need like a knife or something.
[2866.62 → 2867.62] You know what?
[2867.62 → 2868.62] No, no.
[2868.62 → 2869.62] I'll leave it sealed.
[2869.62 → 2870.62] They get to open it?
[2870.62 → 2871.62] Okay.
[2871.62 → 2872.62] Okay, so I want to finish my story.
[2872.62 → 2877.62] So two gamers, one CPU, and then we've got embedding TVs in walls.
[2877.62 → 2879.62] Okay, so maybe you can see where I'm going with this.
[2879.62 → 2880.62] I think I do.
[2880.62 → 2884.62] You know how people do wall PCs that are kind of like an art piece, right?
[2884.62 → 2885.62] Yep.
[2885.62 → 2890.62] So you can see all the water cooling tubing, and you can see all the water blocks and like all that cool stuff.
[2890.62 → 2894.62] I want the two-way wall PC.
[2894.62 → 2895.62] Yeah.
[2895.62 → 2897.62] So we do the PC.
[2897.62 → 2903.62] So we do two screens because LCDs and I mean Olds for that matter, you know, the display technology is so thin now.
[2903.62 → 2905.62] So we take this wall, right?
[2905.62 → 2908.62] And you've got a monitor embedded in one side.
[2908.62 → 2910.62] You've got a monitor embedded in the other side.
[2910.62 → 2915.62] And then you've got the computer in the wall all the surrounding way.
[2915.62 → 2917.62] And then you've just got like extensions for the I.O.
[2917.62 → 2920.62] So you just kind of like plug in under the thing.
[2920.62 → 2923.62] And it's like the ultimate head-to-head LAN station.
[2923.62 → 2928.62] I love how you went from, I'm just going to build a normal computer to a wall.
[2928.62 → 2929.62] Yeah.
[2929.62 → 2930.62] With screens on both sides.
[2930.62 → 2931.62] We're going to build the wall.
[2931.62 → 2932.62] Yeah.
[2932.62 → 2935.62] So we've got like, so it's clear, sort of.
[2935.62 → 2938.62] Like you've got coolant and lighting and all that kind of stuff.
[2938.62 → 2943.62] But like you're sitting head-to-head against someone that you're playing against, and you can like, be like, hey, sup.
[2943.62 → 2944.62] You know?
[2944.62 → 2945.62] That's cool.
[2945.62 → 2946.62] Yeah.
[2946.62 → 2948.62] You just want to be like further from your wife?
[2948.62 → 2949.62] I don't know.
[2949.62 → 2951.62] Well, no, I'm not thinking for us.
[2951.62 → 2955.62] I mean, she doesn't like playing against me anyway because I get mad when I lose.
[2955.62 → 2957.62] Put strain on our relationship.
[2957.62 → 2959.62] She's perfect at Anna, so.
[2959.62 → 2960.62] She's pretty good at Anna.
[2960.62 → 2962.62] She's actually, you know what she's perfect at?
[2962.62 → 2963.62] She's perfect at Left 4 Dead.
[2963.62 → 2964.62] That, yeah.
[2964.62 → 2965.62] Actually, you played with her.
[2965.62 → 2966.62] I did.
[2966.62 → 2967.62] She's perfect at the coordination and stuff.
[2967.62 → 2971.62] She doesn't think she's good, but she was like probably the best player on her team.
[2971.62 → 2972.62] I was on that team.
[2972.62 → 2975.62] I think she's got like 150 hours in the game or something stupid like that.
[2975.62 → 2976.62] Right.
[2976.62 → 2978.62] So she's actually, yeah, she's actually pretty decent.
[2978.62 → 2979.62] You know what?
[2979.62 → 2983.62] A bunch of people in the audience are like, that's average for games I don't even like
[2983.62 → 2984.62] that much.
[2984.62 → 2985.62] Oh, jeez.
[2985.62 → 2988.62] I have 4,000 hours in Rocket League.
[2988.62 → 2989.62] I don't.
[2989.62 → 2990.62] Not personally.
[2990.62 → 2991.62] I'm just saying.
[2991.62 → 2992.62] How many hours do you have in Rocket League?
[2992.62 → 2993.62] I don't know.
[2993.62 → 2994.62] It's a lot.
[2994.62 → 2996.62] I don't want to talk about it.
[2996.62 → 2997.62] I don't know.
[2997.62 → 2999.62] I think it's like 800.
[2999.62 → 3000.62] That's not bad.
[3000.62 → 3001.62] Okay.
[3001.62 → 3004.62] But I've been playing for like many years and I idle it.
[3004.62 → 3007.62] I'm going to play all my games because I tab out and work.
[3007.62 → 3009.62] Oh, yeah.
[3009.62 → 3011.62] Billable hours.
[3011.62 → 3015.62] We should probably do a couple of others.
[3015.62 → 3016.62] Oh, wait.
[3016.62 → 3017.62] No, no, no.
[3017.62 → 3018.62] We should do this.
[3018.62 → 3019.62] Yes.
[3019.62 → 3020.62] Okay.
[3020.62 → 3021.62] What do you want to do?
[3021.62 → 3022.62] I don't know.
[3022.62 → 3023.62] I wasn't actually thinking about it.
[3023.62 → 3024.62] Okay.
[3024.62 → 3029.62] I was like this guy who I thought you had to have all the merch on you, and he showed me his phone.
[3029.62 → 3031.62] I was like, Noddy, do you have to have it all on you?
[3031.62 → 3032.62] Should we give him a chance?
[3032.62 → 3033.62] So I kind of phoned him.
[3033.62 → 3034.62] Okay.
[3034.62 → 3035.62] Where'd he go?
[3035.62 → 3036.62] He's right here.
[3036.62 → 3037.62] Okay.
[3037.62 → 3039.62] You have AMD.
[3039.62 → 3040.62] Oh.
[3040.62 → 3041.62] Well, not any more, apparently.
[3041.62 → 3042.62] Get rest.
[3042.62 → 3043.62] Come on up.
[3043.62 → 3044.62] Come on up.
[3044.62 → 3045.62] Let's see it.
[3045.62 → 3046.62] Let's see it.
[3046.62 → 3049.62] We want to see proof of attendance.
[3049.62 → 3053.62] LTX 2017, 2018 and 2019.
[3053.62 → 3057.62] Let's see if you can pull it off for our Core i9 9900K.
[3057.62 → 3062.62] This is a lot of scrolling.
[3062.62 → 3063.62] It's a lot of scrolling.
[3063.62 → 3067.62] Are you like an Instagram power user or what's going on?
[3067.62 → 3070.62] We are talking with an influencer right now.
[3070.62 → 3071.62] Okay.
[3071.62 → 3072.62] There.
[3072.62 → 3075.62] That's us in that lame ice rink.
[3075.62 → 3076.62] Yep.
[3076.62 → 3077.62] For sure.
[3077.62 → 3079.62] There's your badge from LTX 2018.
[3079.62 → 3080.62] That's 19.
[3080.62 → 3081.62] That's 19.
[3081.62 → 3082.62] Congratulations!
[3082.62 → 3083.62] Upgrade!
[3083.62 → 3094.62] I can pretty much guarantee you that's better than what he's got.
[3094.62 → 3095.62] Yeah.
[3095.62 → 3097.62] It doesn't get much better than that for gaming.
[3097.62 → 3098.62] It's aggressively better than mine.
[3098.62 → 3099.62] So, sick.
[3099.62 → 3104.62] The only thing better is like if you go on, oh shoot, what are they called again?
[3104.62 → 3107.62] Those guys that just hand bin 9900Ks, and then you can...
[3107.62 → 3108.62] Silicon Lottery!
[3108.62 → 3109.62] Sorry, what's that?
[3109.62 → 3110.62] Silicon Lottery.
[3110.62 → 3111.62] Yeah, Silicon Lottery.
[3111.62 → 3112.62] Yeah.
[3112.62 → 3117.62] That's the only thing faster than a 9900K in games is a Silicon Lottery pre-binned 9900K
[3117.62 → 3118.62] in games.
[3118.62 → 3119.62] So, there you go!
[3119.62 → 3120.62] There you go!
[3120.62 → 3121.62] Heck yeah!
[3121.62 → 3124.62] So, one of the other big news items this week, why don't we actually do like one or
[3124.62 → 3128.62] two news items before we wrap the show, was of course the launch of the RTX Super,
[3128.62 → 3132.62] which we thought was so important that we actually didn't make a video about it.
[3134.62 → 3139.62] In all seriousness though, we will never say no to free performance.
[3139.62 → 3144.62] I think it's about what, 7% faster than the RTX 2080.
[3144.62 → 3145.62] Sweet!
[3145.62 → 3148.62] But at the same price, which is pretty sick.
[3148.62 → 3149.62] That's cool.
[3149.62 → 3152.62] It does consume a little bit more power, and therefore it actually gets a little bit louder.
[3152.62 → 3157.62] But, this is not just a matter of Nvidia cranking up the clock speed a little bit.
[3157.62 → 3161.62] They actually did add some more, I'm actually, was it more...
[3161.62 → 3164.62] Probably a while ago and then put it on the shelf until AMD did something, and then they were like...
[3164.62 → 3165.62] Well, that's possible.
[3165.62 → 3170.62] Oh, they did put faster GDDR6 memory on it.
[3170.62 → 3175.62] So, that's kind of a significant upgrade I guess.
[3175.62 → 3180.62] It's apparently the fastest GDDR6 on the planet, it's on the RTX 2080 Super.
[3180.62 → 3182.62] It's actually faster than the 2080 Ti.
[3182.62 → 3183.62] I feel like they've...
[3183.62 → 3188.62] I don't remember a specific situation, but I feel like they've done that before.
[3188.62 → 3190.62] Yeah, so, yeah, it's got more CUBA cores.
[3190.62 → 3195.62] It's got like a hundred and something, 128 more CUBA cores or something along those lines.
[3195.62 → 3201.62] So, it's not one of those upgrades where all they really did was just crank up the clock speed a little bit,
[3201.62 → 3204.62] which was something that you could have done on your own if you had just bought a previous one.
[3204.62 → 3205.62] Yeah, and rematch.
[3205.62 → 3207.62] So, it's a little bit faster.
[3207.62 → 3210.62] It's cool that there is actual hardware differences, I will definitely give them that.
[3210.62 → 3217.62] Yeah, so, this basically completes Nvidia's move to eliminating the RTX 2060, 2070 and 2080.
[3217.62 → 3220.62] So, it's now everything is super, thank you for asking.
[3220.62 → 3221.62] And AMD...
[3221.62 → 3222.62] What?
[3222.62 → 3228.62] I don't know, I made the same joke with them when they came in, and they like...
[3228.62 → 3233.62] They actually flew up to talk about this launch with us, and they were like...
[3233.62 → 3237.62] One of the guys during the presentation was like trying to tell us all about the Super cards.
[3237.62 → 3239.62] And he's like, yeah, so we like did this.
[3239.62 → 3240.62] I'm like, right, so it's a little faster.
[3240.62 → 3242.62] And he's like, yeah, yeah, we did this, we did this.
[3242.62 → 3244.62] I'm like, right, so it's a little bit faster.
[3244.62 → 3250.62] And then, and then they started this like second presentation about their new tool.
[3250.62 → 3252.62] Hold on, what's it called?
[3252.62 → 3254.62] It's their new benchmarking tool.
[3254.62 → 3256.62] Not Perfect.
[3256.62 → 3258.62] What is it?
[3258.62 → 3259.62] Can't find it.
[3259.62 → 3262.62] I actually don't know if they have released it publicly.
[3262.62 → 3267.62] It's a it's a frame rate capture tool called, ah yes, Frame View.
[3267.62 → 3272.62] So this was really exciting because Nvidia was launching new graphics cards, which is usually
[3272.62 → 3275.62] my jam, but I was like, okay, yeah, they're a little bit faster.
[3275.62 → 3277.62] The 2060 Super, that was a heck of an upgrade.
[3277.62 → 3281.62] But the 2070 and 2080 Super were like, okay, you guys needed to react to AMD, I get it.
[3281.62 → 3285.62] But Frame View is a super cool tool.
[3285.62 → 3289.62] So, excuse me, it's cross API.
[3289.62 → 3290.62] Okay.
[3290.62 → 3292.62] So you can actually use it with newer games.
[3292.62 → 3301.62] It, it takes a lot of the FLAT nonsense where in order to get, to get frame time benchmarking,
[3301.62 → 3307.62] where you're, where you're looking not just at the average FPS, but also analyzing those,
[3307.62 → 3314.62] those, those spikes in the time that it takes to draw a frame that result in the like hitchiness
[3314.62 → 3318.62] and the stuttering that you actually feel while you're gaming far more than the actual frame rate.
[3318.62 → 3322.62] It takes that entire process, which has been very manual up until now.
[3322.62 → 3324.62] I don't think we actually covered this on WAN Show.
[3324.62 → 3326.62] It's like super, it's a super huge deal.
[3326.62 → 3331.62] It takes all that, which has been like an Excel nightmare that poor Anthony has been going through.
[3331.62 → 3332.62] Super annoying to work with.
[3332.62 → 3333.62] Yeah.
[3333.62 → 3336.62] For the last couple of years and pretty much automates the whole darn thing.
[3336.62 → 3340.62] And what's crazy is it's also cross-platform.
[3340.62 → 3342.62] So it actually works with AMD cards as well.
[3342.62 → 3345.62] So yeah, it's, it's super awesome.
[3345.62 → 3351.62] I mean, don't applaud Nvidia for it because anytime Nvidia does something, there's a reason.
[3351.62 → 3364.62] And the reason that Nvidia might release a better benchmarking tool that allows people to better measure the performance that matters is they are pretty confident that they're going to come out well.
[3364.62 → 3365.62] Yeah.
[3365.62 → 3366.62] With it.
[3366.62 → 3367.62] Yeah.
[3367.62 → 3368.62] So that's a yeah.
[3368.62 → 3369.62] I wouldn't know.
[3369.62 → 3370.62] Hey guys, look at this thing.
[3370.62 → 3371.62] It's totally impartial.
[3371.62 → 3372.62] Well, no, I don't.
[3372.62 → 3373.62] I believe it's impartial.
[3373.62 → 3375.62] No, I'm sure it is, but it's going to make it look good.
[3375.62 → 3381.62] Because it actually has a ton of parameters that reviewers can dial in to determine exactly what kind of data they want.
[3381.62 → 3386.62] So we can present the data in any game we want now that's running any API we want.
[3386.62 → 3395.62] And we can, we can actually graph it and chart it exactly the way we want to tell the story the best way that we think is, is right.
[3395.62 → 3399.62] Another way that I would say this is actually good for everyone in the audience.
[3399.62 → 3400.62] Yeah.
[3400.62 → 3404.62] I mean, still don't cheer too hard, is that it's going to be easier for people to do this.
[3404.62 → 3406.62] So there will probably be more of it.
[3406.62 → 3407.62] Yeah.
[3407.62 → 3408.62] Which is good.
[3408.62 → 3409.62] Absolutely.
[3409.62 → 3418.62] And being able to cross-reference reviews from different places and see the way that they did it, the part of the game they tested, the parameters they were actually looking at, is a very valuable thing when shopping for a card.
[3418.62 → 3426.62] Absolutely. You should never take just one review as the be all and end all, because that reviewer might not even test the game that matters a lot to you.
[3426.62 → 3427.62] Yeah.
[3427.62 → 3441.62] And you'll, you can run into situations where whether it's one CPU or another one or one GPU or another one, where products that are otherwise quite competitive head to head can have significant swings in performance one way or the other.
[3441.62 → 3443.62] Counter-Strike's a classic one for that.
[3443.62 → 3449.62] There's a there are a bunch of other games that have been around for a long time that will skew in one way or the other, depending on what brand you're using.
[3449.62 → 3450.62] Although I don't know if you watched.
[3450.62 → 3452.62] I know I've, I've heard.
[3452.62 → 3453.62] Yeah.
[3453.62 → 3454.62] Okay. So this is actually great.
[3454.62 → 3464.62] There was a little bit of drama around this whole, the whole RTX super release where AMD actually claimed that they bluffed Nvidia into cutting GPU prices.
[3464.62 → 3465.62] This is on extreme tech.
[3465.62 → 3467.62] If you can go ahead and throw up my laptop for a second here.
[3467.62 → 3486.62] So Scott Perelman came out and said, yeah, we intentionally told Nvidia that our GPU prices were going to be higher so that they would price their graphics cards higher so that then we could respond by making our prices lower.
[3486.62 → 3487.62] They were going to be.
[3487.62 → 3489.62] Go ahead and go ahead and cut back to me.
[3489.62 → 3490.62] You know what?
[3490.62 → 3496.62] I call bull spit on that because I think Luke, you can probably speak to this.
[3496.62 → 3506.62] Pretty much every graphics card launch in the time since Linus Media Group has existed has followed a formula of taking the existing cards on the market.
[3506.62 → 3507.62] Go ahead.
[3507.62 → 3508.62] No, I'll leave you.
[3508.62 → 3510.62] We've been talking about this for so long.
[3510.62 → 3511.62] We, okay.
[3511.62 → 3512.62] We, you have to do that video.
[3512.62 → 3513.62] Okay.
[3513.62 → 3518.62] We've been talking about this video for years when the second a graphics card is even remotely rumoured,
[3518.62 → 3519.62] Yeah.
[3519.62 → 3526.62] You just make a video as a mock review of that graphics card and just put the numbers up that are going to be there in a few months.
[3526.62 → 3528.62] Because it's so methodical.
[3528.62 → 3533.62] Basically, they just increase the numbers by a fixed percentage, and they're like, sweet, hooray, new graphics card.
[3533.62 → 3534.62] Yup.
[3534.62 → 3535.62] And the pricing.
[3535.62 → 3536.62] But it's more about the pricing.
[3536.62 → 3537.62] It's thrilling.
[3537.62 → 3539.62] As soon as we know how much a graphics card costs.
[3539.62 → 3540.62] Yes.
[3540.62 → 3542.62] We can extrapolate what the performance will be.
[3542.62 → 3544.62] Because they're never going to ruin their stack.
[3544.62 → 3545.62] That's right.
[3545.62 → 3547.62] So they'll always let it slide right on in.
[3547.62 → 3548.62] Yup.
[3548.62 → 3554.62] So if they've already got a product for 350 bucks and a product for $700, and it's coming out for 500 bucks, you can bet your butt.
[3554.62 → 3557.62] There's the law of diminishing returns, and we could probably plot that curve.
[3557.62 → 3558.62] Yup.
[3558.62 → 3559.62] Right?
[3559.62 → 3560.62] So there's your diminishing returns.
[3560.62 → 3562.62] Price performance goes a little bit down as you get near the top and a little bit.
[3562.62 → 3563.62] And it's going to sit right there.
[3563.62 → 3564.62] Yeah.
[3564.62 → 3565.62] That's pretty much it.
[3565.62 → 3567.62] So I call nonsense on this.
[3567.62 → 3572.62] I think they priced it according to what they thought they could have gotten away with.
[3572.62 → 3576.62] And then Nvidia released new graphics cards.
[3576.62 → 3580.62] Which AMD surely knew were coming but probably didn't know the pricing.
[3580.62 → 3584.62] And then AMD reacted with pricing, and it's business as usual.
[3584.62 → 3585.62] Yeah.
[3585.62 → 3592.62] I think to claim that you're playing 4D chess over here is disingenuous at best.
[3592.62 → 3593.62] Yeah.
[3593.62 → 3599.62] I really, I understand why you guys don't do that video, but it would just, I would love it.
[3599.62 → 3600.62] Yeah.
[3600.62 → 3601.62] We can't.
[3601.62 → 3604.62] I mean we did that whole thing where we, I forget what CPU it was.
[3604.62 → 3605.62] It would be very confusing for everyone.
[3605.62 → 3611.62] But we did a preview of a CPU that was based on fudging the CPU with another CPU.
[3611.62 → 3612.62] Horizon 5.
[3612.62 → 3613.62] Oh, Horizon 5.
[3613.62 → 3614.62] Okay.
[3614.62 → 3618.62] So we, and in fairness to us, those numbers were damn close.
[3618.62 → 3619.62] It was pretty accurate.
[3619.62 → 3620.62] It was pretty good.
[3620.62 → 3621.62] But people got real mad.
[3621.62 → 3626.62] People were super mad because the way that we did it was we took parameters that you can
[3626.62 → 3628.62] tune on a different CPU.
[3628.62 → 3632.62] Like you can manually enable and disable cores, not cache so much.
[3632.62 → 3633.62] So that's something that.
[3633.62 → 3634.62] There were a few things that weren't perfect.
[3634.62 → 3637.62] There were some things that were imperfect about it, but we acknowledged it.
[3637.62 → 3639.62] So you can, you can tune how many cores you have.
[3639.62 → 3640.62] You can tune the clock speed.
[3640.62 → 3646.62] You can even tune how many cores will boost or turbo up to a given clock speed.
[3646.62 → 3651.62] And we, we created out of a CPU we already had something that we thought was going to be
[3651.62 → 3655.62] very close to the one that AMD was rumoured to be launching based on the best information
[3655.62 → 3656.62] we could find.
[3656.62 → 3661.62] And people were so mad because the cache was a little off, but this is funny.
[3661.62 → 3666.62] I wish I could find this article because I actually wrote an article for Hardware Canucks
[3666.62 → 3668.62] about 10 years ago.
[3668.62 → 3671.62] This is a little known fact, actually.
[3671.62 → 3676.62] Hardware Canucks holds a very special place in my heart because I sort of used to work there.
[3676.62 → 3681.62] You can actually find written reviews from me archived somewhere.
[3681.62 → 3685.62] I reviewed some weird water block, like an Enzo Tech water block or something like that.
[3685.62 → 3690.62] My wife actually did a review of the Irwin Allure.
[3690.62 → 3691.62] This I didn't know.
[3691.62 → 3692.62] I'm going to see if I can find it.
[3692.62 → 3693.62] Now I'm interested.
[3693.62 → 3696.62] I got my hands on this thing.
[3696.62 → 3698.62] Well, Irwin wanted a review of it.
[3698.62 → 3699.62] Here we go.
[3699.62 → 3700.62] You guys can switch to my screen here.
[3700.62 → 3703.62] So I wanted a review of this.
[3703.62 → 3706.62] I wanted to do a review of this thing because I thought it was pretty cool.
[3706.62 → 3713.62] And it was like this kind of white case with like floral decoration and Swarovski crystals on it.
[3713.62 → 3715.62] And I was like, I don't feel qualified to review this.
[3715.62 → 3718.62] So I was like, okay, I'm getting my wife involved in this.
[3718.62 → 3719.62] Okay.
[3719.62 → 3720.62] It feels extremely 2008.
[3720.62 → 3721.62] I love that it's from 2008.
[3721.62 → 3723.62] This is becoming a bit of an aside here.
[3723.62 → 3724.62] What was I talking about again?
[3724.62 → 3725.62] Who cares?
[3725.62 → 3726.62] I don't remember.
[3726.62 → 3727.62] Oh yeah, right.
[3727.62 → 3731.62] Hardware Connects holds a very special place in my heart because I actually, okay, actually,
[3731.62 → 3732.62] cut back to me.
[3732.62 → 3733.62] We'll come back to the Irwin Allure.
[3733.62 → 3734.62] I thought you meant before that.
[3734.62 → 3744.62] So I did a review at a very special time in CPU history when Intel actually had four different
[3744.62 → 3753.62] CPUs that all had the same core count that all ran at the same clock speed, but had different amounts of cache.
[3753.62 → 3754.62] Okay.
[3754.62 → 3756.62] So they had a Pentium something.
[3756.62 → 3763.62] They had a something like, I think it was a core two something, 7300 or something like that.
[3763.62 → 3765.62] They had like a 6600.
[3765.62 → 3778.62] Don't quote me on the exact model numbers, but basically I got to do this fun little investigation where I could take like for like, architecturally the same, core count the same,
[3778.62 → 3788.62] clock speed the same, and I could see how much the on-chip cache actually affected the performance in games, which was the thing that I cared about.
[3788.62 → 3798.62] And I was fascinated to find that down to the fairly low end, it actually, and then remember guys, this was at the time.
[3798.62 → 3800.62] CPUs have gotten quite a bit more sophisticated.
[3800.62 → 3802.62] It was like different time, games have changed, platforms have changed.
[3802.62 → 3817.62] But at the time, they actually weren't that far off until you got down to the very low end, which I thought was really cool because the conventional wisdom, you know, going, going just, I mean, for the computer industry was just like, yeah, get the one with more cache because it matters a lot.
[3817.62 → 3820.62] And generally speaking, that had been true.
[3820.62 → 3824.62] Like an example of that was AMD's Athlon X2 launch.
[3824.62 → 3832.62] I specifically went out and bought a 4400 plus instead of a 4200 plus because it had, I think it was a Meg instead of 512 kilobits of cache or something like that.
[3832.62 → 3833.62] Yeah.
[3833.62 → 3835.62] Whatever those pathetic numbers are now.
[3835.62 → 3836.62] All right.
[3836.62 → 3838.62] So anyway, going back to the Unwind Allure.
[3838.62 → 3839.62] Anyway, I can't find that article anymore.
[3839.62 → 3841.62] It seems to be dead, but this one's not.
[3841.62 → 3847.62] So why don't I read a little bit of it to embarrass my wife who is over there in the merch booth, presumably.
[3847.62 → 3848.62] Can you cut back to my screen?
[3848.62 → 3851.62] So Porgy is her gamer handle.
[3851.62 → 3852.62] Whoops.
[3852.62 → 3853.62] Wow.
[3853.62 → 3854.62] She doesn't have, oh, okay.
[3854.62 → 3855.62] There we go.
[3855.62 → 3859.62] Before we begin this review, I have to thank the guest author of that.
[3859.62 → 3860.62] So I wrote this, apparently.
[3860.62 → 3863.62] Guest author of this review who just happens to be Miss Postal's girlfriend.
[3863.62 → 3866.62] So that was my, that was my username on the forum.
[3866.62 → 3879.62] And I, I remember my, what I had originally wanted was methylphenidate and my boss didn't want me to use that because I forget what it's for, but it was like, what's it for again?
[3879.62 → 3881.62] It's no, no, it's not demonic.
[3881.62 → 3882.62] It's a drug.
[3882.62 → 3884.62] Yeah, it's for ADD.
[3884.62 → 3885.62] Right, right, right.
[3885.62 → 3891.62] So the reason I had wanted to use that was because of, you know, my history with being diagnosed with ADD when I was a kid.
[3891.62 → 3893.62] And I was like, oh yeah, I think that's cool.
[3893.62 → 3900.62] And he didn't want, he didn't want something that was like associated with a disorder to be my, my username or something like that.
[3900.62 → 3905.62] So I don't know how public knowledge this is, but I guess I'm kind of spilling the beans on it.
[3905.62 → 3908.62] Hardware Canucks used to be owned by NCI.
[3908.62 → 3909.62] Not anymore.
[3909.62 → 3912.62] NCI is dead and Hardware Canucks lives on.
[3912.62 → 3913.62] Bravo, Hardware Canucks.
[3913.62 → 3914.62] Good job.
[3914.62 → 3915.62] You guys do a freaking awesome job.
[3915.62 → 3916.62] Yeah.
[3921.62 → 3929.62] So anyway, my, my boss wouldn't let me use methylphenidate, and I was insistent on having a drug as my username for some reason.
[3929.62 → 3930.62] I don't know.
[3930.62 → 3932.62] I was kind of a weird, I was kind of a weird kid.
[3932.62 → 3937.62] Um, so this just happens to be Mr. Postal's girlfriend, no longer girlfriend that worked out really well.
[3937.62 → 3943.62] This is a unique case that's targeted towards a niche market and having a woman review it definitely gives it a different perspective.
[3943.62 → 3944.62] Oh no.
[3944.62 → 3952.62] Apparently it's Sky MTL who actually still works there and is still helping run Hardware Canucks, um, wrote that as like an editor's note.
[3952.62 → 3955.62] Uh, so let's see if we can, uh, what do you think guys?
[3955.62 → 3958.62] Packaging and specifications, accessories, exterior impressions.
[3958.62 → 3960.62] Why don't we go with the exterior impressions.
[3960.62 → 3966.62] The first thing I noticed about the metallic gray case was the fact that it's actually more white than gray.
[3966.62 → 3967.62] Ooh.
[3967.62 → 3970.62] It has a beautiful white matte finish that appears shiny and reflects light from every angle.
[3970.62 → 3975.62] While they don't look like much in the pictures, the Swarovski crystals shine brilliantly and are stunning.
[3975.62 → 3976.62] Ooh.
[3976.62 → 3981.62] They actually add to the classy high-end impression Irwin was going for when designing the case.
[3981.62 → 3986.62] Also, since this is an NATO case, it is quite small when compared to its ATX brethren.
[3986.62 → 3988.62] I helped her with that last part.
[3988.62 → 3996.62] Uh, the photos are long gone because I'm pretty sure the server Hardware Canucks used to run on is like, has been dead for ages.
[3996.62 → 4001.62] But just so you guys can see what she was talking about, this is, this is the case.
[4001.62 → 4002.62] Oh.
[4002.62 → 4004.62] That is extremely 2008 though.
[4004.62 → 4008.62] You have to understand, this was high fashion at that time.
[4008.62 → 4009.62] Oh wow.
[4009.62 → 4014.62] That is just, it's, you know what, I think the only word for it is stunning.
[4014.62 → 4016.62] Where are the crystals?
[4016.62 → 4022.62] Uh, so the crystals, like, like it said in the review, okay, they're, they're kinda, they don't stand out that much.
[4022.62 → 4023.62] But there's one here.
[4023.62 → 4024.62] Oh.
[4024.62 → 4025.62] Okay.
[4025.62 → 4026.62] One here.
[4026.62 → 4027.62] Oh, okay.
[4027.62 → 4028.62] Here.
[4028.62 → 4029.62] Here and here.
[4029.62 → 4030.62] It's kinda not really in the centre of the flower.
[4030.62 → 4032.62] I'm not sure what the strategy was there.
[4032.62 → 4033.62] Which one there?
[4033.62 → 4034.62] One there.
[4034.62 → 4035.62] We missed.
[4035.62 → 4036.62] Don't worry about it.
[4036.62 → 4037.62] Alright, you can cut back to us guys.
[4037.62 → 4040.62] Um, so that was, that was a lot of fun.
[4040.62 → 4044.62] I think our, our last couple of, our last couple of topics here are some pretty short ones.
[4044.62 → 4048.62] Uh, the room, word on the street, the source here is mobile syrup.
[4048.62 → 4055.62] Word on the street is the iPhone 11 is not going to have a, uh, a USB type C port.
[4055.62 → 4058.62] It will apparently, yeah, I know, right?
[4058.62 → 4059.62] What are they doing?
[4059.62 → 4061.62] Like, what year is it?
[4061.62 → 4063.62] USB, USB 2.
[4063.62 → 4064.62] Like, that's what Lightning is.
[4064.62 → 4068.62] Okay, in fairness to Apple, Lightning was a valuable innovation.
[4068.62 → 4073.62] Like, I am as anti, yeah, I'm as anti-proprietary charging connectors as anyone.
[4073.62 → 4078.62] Because I lived through that hell that was cell phones in the early 2000s.
[4078.62 → 4080.62] Every single one having its own.
[4080.62 → 4081.62] Every single one.
[4081.62 → 4085.62] And, and them all being like 30, 40 bucks to get a stupid cable.
[4085.62 → 4092.62] Um, but the Lightning connector was legitimately a way better solution than micro USB.
[4092.62 → 4093.62] It was reversible.
[4093.62 → 4094.62] It was durable.
[4094.62 → 4096.62] It was freaking awesome.
[4096.62 → 4098.62] Was freaking awesome.
[4098.62 → 4101.62] That was a long, long time ago.
[4101.62 → 4107.62] Um, so, word on the street is that the next one is finally going to be USB type C.
[4107.62 → 4113.62] But a lot of people were hoping that it would be this time around, especially after the 2018 iPad Pro.
[4113.62 → 4114.62] Um,
[4114.62 → 4115.62] If you could swap.
[4115.62 → 4116.62] Yeah.
[4116.62 → 4118.62] Lightning's position with USB-C's.
[4118.62 → 4122.62] So, like, Lightning is the thing for everything, not just Apple.
[4122.62 → 4123.62] Would you?
[4123.62 → 4125.62] Ooh, well, I mean.
[4125.62 → 4128.62] Like, do you prefer the connectors ignoring everything else?
[4128.62 → 4129.62] Ignoring it.
[4129.62 → 4132.62] But does it run at USB 3 speeds?
[4132.62 → 4133.62] Sure.
[4133.62 → 4134.62] Yeah.
[4134.62 → 4135.62] So, why, okay.
[4135.62 → 4137.62] So, the iPhone 10 runs at USB 3 speeds?
[4137.62 → 4140.62] I thought it was only the original iPad Pro and then they kind of killed it.
[4140.62 → 4141.62] Yeah.
[4141.62 → 4144.62] Do you, do you just have to go and get a special, special cable?
[4144.62 → 4145.62] Yeah.
[4145.62 → 4146.62] Okay, cool.
[4146.62 → 4148.62] So, there you go guys.
[4148.62 → 4149.62] I'm basically just talking the connector.
[4149.62 → 4150.62] So, just talking the connector.
[4150.62 → 4156.62] So, do you want basically, uh, like an oval, like some kind of shape with pins on the inside?
[4156.62 → 4160.62] Or do you like having the exposed pins on the kind of solid core?
[4160.62 → 4161.62] Wow.
[4161.62 → 4162.62] So, if I could have Lightning.
[4162.62 → 4163.62] Yeah.
[4163.62 → 4164.62] You know what?
[4164.62 → 4166.62] Like Nintendo Switch controllers or Lightning.
[4166.62 → 4169.62] Okay, and it has as many conductors as USB type C.
[4169.62 → 4170.62] So, I can have my display port over it.
[4170.62 → 4171.62] I'm more of a tech.
[4171.62 → 4172.62] I'm just talking.
[4172.62 → 4174.62] If I can just have, yeah, I'd take it.
[4174.62 → 4175.62] Yeah, I thought so.
[4175.62 → 4176.62] Yeah, I would take it.
[4176.62 → 4177.62] I love the Lightning.
[4177.62 → 4178.62] I love the Lightning connector.
[4178.62 → 4180.62] I actually really like Lightning connectors too.
[4180.62 → 4185.62] It just sucks because, especially in this situation, like if you have a Mac laptop, that's all type C.
[4185.62 → 4186.62] Yeah.
[4186.62 → 4192.62] So, you can't even have one, like that's a really weird situation.
[4192.62 → 4197.62] You're, even if you go with all Apple, you still have to have a weird combination of things.
[4197.62 → 4198.62] You still have to have two cables.
[4198.62 → 4202.62] Whereas like, honestly, USB type C life has been amazing to me.
[4202.62 → 4203.62] Yeah.
[4203.62 → 4209.62] So, ever since I got a Nintendo Switch, Racer Blade Stealth, and I'm still rocking the Note 9.
[4209.62 → 4213.62] Looks like I won't be changing that out because apparently the headphone jack is dead on the 10.
[4213.62 → 4215.62] Do you go C to C at all or are you C to A?
[4215.62 → 4220.62] I almost never go C to C because I rarely connect those devices to each other.
[4220.62 → 4224.62] It's more just that when I'm travelling especially, I only have to carry a single charging cable.
[4224.62 → 4225.62] Yeah.
[4225.62 → 4228.62] I just bring my laptop power adapter, and I'm like, I'm done.
[4228.62 → 4229.62] I'm done.
[4229.62 → 4230.62] That's it.
[4230.62 → 4231.62] Charge all my stuff.
[4231.62 → 4234.62] For non-outside of that, I found these cables that are braided.
[4234.62 → 4239.62] They come with Velcro straps on them, and they have reversible A, and they're super cheap on Amazon.
[4239.62 → 4240.62] Is that the Silverstone one?
[4240.62 → 4242.62] Oh no, it's just like some random.
[4242.62 → 4245.62] It's a random Amazon brand I found, and I am completely sold.
[4245.62 → 4247.62] I found the Type A reversible ones.
[4247.62 → 4249.62] They're really convenient, but they do tend to break.
[4249.62 → 4251.62] These, okay, I hear ya.
[4251.62 → 4252.62] They're really thin.
[4252.62 → 4256.62] I haven't had one break yet, and I use them a lot, and they like to live in my pockets.
[4256.62 → 4260.62] But yeah, I suspect one of them will break eventually because they are definitely more fragile.
[4260.62 → 4268.62] Alright, speaking of more fragile, I guess this show had to come to a close at some point.
[4268.62 → 4269.62] It was fragile.
[4269.62 → 4270.62] It's ending now?
[4270.62 → 4271.62] Yeah, it's broken.
[4271.62 → 4272.62] It's done.
[4272.62 → 4274.62] Oh, okay, okay.
[4274.62 → 4275.62] You know what?
[4275.62 → 4276.62] Okay, hold on a second.
[4276.62 → 4277.62] Okay, yeah.
[4277.62 → 4278.62] We do have to do our super chats.
[4278.62 → 4281.62] Another thing I want to say is we're streaming panels tomorrow as well, right?
[4281.62 → 4282.62] Yes.
[4282.62 → 4285.62] So if you want to check out Float plane tomorrow, we'll be streaming channels on-
[4285.62 → 4286.62] You shall.
[4286.62 → 4290.62] With Kyle's channel and our channel, basically the creators that are here at the show.
[4290.62 → 4293.62] So check out the live stream there.
[4293.62 → 4295.62] Alright, let's hit up some super chats here.
[4295.62 → 4304.62] Ride Trace, Mr. Plump Guy, Mike Roof, Val Jenkins, James Rosa's, Trent Murray, Titan33,
[4304.62 → 4308.62] Gelatengude says hi to everyone from LTX.
[4308.62 → 4311.62] Also tell the people that Linus is small.
[4311.62 → 4312.62] Wow.
[4312.62 → 4319.62] Paladin stem, Bearded Dragon, Nival, Robert says Twitch sub giveaway.
[4319.62 → 4321.62] What does that even mean?
[4321.62 → 4322.62] I have no idea.
[4322.62 → 4324.62] He spent five bucks to send that message.
[4324.62 → 4325.62] Yeah.
[4325.62 → 4326.62] Bummer.
[4326.62 → 4329.62] Maximilian sent in a super chat.
[4329.62 → 4330.62] Bates says totally pre-recorded.
[4330.62 → 4333.62] JK, I'm actually at LTX.
[4333.62 → 4335.62] Local donation.
[4335.62 → 4337.62] Conspiracy smashed.
[4337.62 → 4338.62] Yeah.
[4338.62 → 4339.62] Sloth says, love you guys.
[4339.62 → 4341.62] Show more OS 10 x86 stuff.
[4341.62 → 4344.62] We will have some more Hackintosh stuff coming.
[4344.62 → 4348.62] Pippin Boy says, I got a job offer from Partings, but I'm conflicted.
[4348.62 → 4350.62] Because it's a long way from California.
[4350.62 → 4352.62] What's cool about living in Canada?
[4352.62 → 4354.62] Are you guys enjoying Canada so far?
[4356.62 → 4357.62] There you go.
[4357.62 → 4363.62] It's frankly speaking, it's kind of like America except Netflix sucks.
[4363.62 → 4373.62] Oh wow, I think I broke it.
[4373.62 → 4374.62] There we go.
[4374.62 → 4376.62] Robert says underwear.
[4376.62 → 4380.62] Dennis in the back, Linus in the front, party in the back, business in the front.
[4380.62 → 4383.62] Also scream out at Winnipeg underscore 21 on Twitter.
[4383.62 → 4385.62] He tried to get me to sell that to you a while ago.
[4385.62 → 4386.62] Wow.
[4386.62 → 4388.62] Are you wearing your official LTT underwear right now?
[4388.62 → 4389.62] Of course I'm wearing my underwear right now.
[4389.62 → 4390.62] So am I.
[4390.62 → 4391.62] What colour?
[4391.62 → 4392.62] Prove it!
[4392.62 → 4393.62] Alright.
[4393.62 → 4400.62] So, I figured I had to go with the classic orange.
[4400.62 → 4401.62] Yes, so did I.
[4401.62 → 4402.62] Yes!
[4402.62 → 4407.62] I literally saved this one.
[4407.62 → 4409.62] It is not worn.
[4409.62 → 4410.62] I left it in the package.
[4410.62 → 4413.62] So it wouldn't even come out of the package until day one LTX.
[4413.62 → 4415.62] I too am wearing brand-new underwear today.
[4415.62 → 4418.62] You know, there's something about a brand-new undergarment.
[4418.62 → 4422.62] You know, you put on a brand-new pair of socks, brand a new pair of underwear, it's like brand new me.
[4422.62 → 4424.62] You know, it feels good in the morning.
[4424.62 → 4425.62] Just snug and, you know.
[4425.62 → 4427.62] Guys, make sure you check out the underwear if you haven't.
[4427.62 → 4429.62] We have a bunch for sale here.
[4429.62 → 4433.62] The reviews so far from people who are walking around in it are that it is super comfy.
[4433.62 → 4434.62] Awesome!
[4434.62 → 4435.62] There you go.
[4437.62 → 4438.62] It is super great.
[4438.62 → 4439.62] I love it.
[4439.62 → 4443.62] Okay, okay.
[4443.62 → 4444.62] You know what?
[4444.62 → 4450.62] It's become apparent based on the attendance at LTX this year that our Google demographics information is clearly wrong.
[4450.62 → 4454.62] It's got to be more like 3% women.
[4457.62 → 4459.62] Like, forget that 1%.
[4459.62 → 4461.62] This has been really eye-opening.
[4461.62 → 4470.62] You know what's funny is my wife actually asked for some extra scraps from the underwear project of the fabric.
[4470.62 → 4474.62] And she's actually working on sewing herself a pair just as like a total joke.
[4474.62 → 4481.62] But if they're really nice, and she actually likes them, because I don't know how popular boxer briefs are for women.
[4481.62 → 4482.62] I don't think very.
[4482.62 → 4484.62] Okay, well there's, we got one fan.
[4484.62 → 4485.62] We got one fan.
[4485.62 → 4491.62] If we do another run of them, maybe we could do like a very, very short run or something like that.
[4491.62 → 4492.62] We could try it.
[4492.62 → 4493.62] Unless they sell super well.
[4493.62 → 4495.62] Yeah, we could try and make it happen.
[4495.62 → 4496.62] Never know.
[4496.62 → 4501.62] Because we do have a very male audience, but they might buy them for people in their lives.
[4501.62 → 4504.62] Yeah, but I would like to encourage them to not be that guy.
[4505.62 → 4514.62] You know, that moment when you're at, you know, Home Hardware or Home Depot or something, and you realize it's Mother's Day.
[4514.62 → 4517.62] I was thinking about these tech guys on YouTube and I think you should wear them in your pants.
[4517.62 → 4518.62] Yeah, yeah.
[4518.62 → 4519.62] It's great.
[4519.62 → 4529.62] You know, I, I, I, you know, I painstakingly, you know, went out down aisle 13 that I don't normally go down and got you this flashlight.
[4529.62 → 4530.62] Happy Mother's Day.
[4530.62 → 4531.62] You know?
[4531.62 → 4532.62] Yeah, yeah.
[4532.62 → 4533.62] Andrew says, love LTX.
[4533.62 → 4535.62] How much bigger will it be next year?
[4535.62 → 4538.62] No idea.
[4538.62 → 4541.62] We didn't think it was going to be this big this year.
[4541.62 → 4542.62] Yeah.
[4542.62 → 4543.62] Yeah.
[4543.62 → 4544.62] So we wish ourselves luck.
[4544.62 → 4547.62] We're so grateful to you guys for all being here.
[4547.62 → 4559.62] Also, speaking of how big the event is this year, thank you to all the volunteers.
[4559.62 → 4560.62] Yeah.
[4560.62 → 4561.62] Yeah.
[4561.62 → 4562.62] Totally.
[4563.62 → 4564.62] That's been awesome.
[4564.62 → 4566.62] All the volunteers have been great.
[4566.62 → 4568.62] It would have been impossible without them.
[4568.62 → 4569.62] Yeah, actually.
[4569.62 → 4570.62] Yeah.
[4570.62 → 4571.62] Would have been impossible without our volunteers.
[4571.62 → 4572.62] Yeah.
[4572.62 → 4575.62] Garrett says, the WAN show is filmed in front of a live studio audience.
[4576.62 → 4577.62] Help control the pet population.
[4577.62 → 4578.62] Have your pets spayed or neutered.
[4578.62 → 4579.62] Good night.
[4580.62 → 4581.62] Thanks, Garrett.
[4581.62 → 4582.62] Really valuable message there.
[4582.62 → 4584.62] Arlene Etienne, the event looks so good.
[4584.62 → 4586.62] Be there next year for sure.
[4586.62 → 4587.62] Glad to hear that.
[4587.62 → 4588.62] I am amazed.
[4588.62 → 4589.62] Have you seen the map?
[4589.62 → 4590.62] No.
[4590.62 → 4591.62] So we have a map.
[4591.62 → 4592.62] I haven't been able to make it past BYOC.
[4592.62 → 4593.62] Right.
[4593.62 → 4594.62] I've been stuck all day.
[4594.62 → 4601.62] So we have a map where people are putting in pins from where, I swear, everything but
[4601.62 → 4603.62] Antarctica, we've got covered.
[4603.62 → 4604.62] We've got to improve.
[4604.62 → 4605.62] Actually, yeah.
[4605.62 → 4606.62] I was just going to...
[4606.62 → 4607.62] Okay.
[4607.62 → 4608.62] That's got to be a troll.
[4608.62 → 4609.62] That's okay.
[4609.62 → 4610.62] No.
[4610.62 → 4611.62] We have a fan in Antarctica.
[4611.62 → 4613.62] Because we had to work on Flow plane servers for them.
[4613.62 → 4614.62] What?
[4614.62 → 4615.62] I'm literally not kidding.
[4616.62 → 4617.62] At all.
[4617.62 → 4619.62] We added server capacity for someone in Antarctica?
[4619.62 → 4620.62] For one person?
[4620.62 → 4621.62] No, but we were like, all right.
[4621.62 → 4622.62] I mean, which is fine.
[4622.62 → 4624.62] I'm going to make this slightly less terrible.
[4624.62 → 4626.62] Because he knew it was going to be really bad.
[4626.62 → 4629.62] If I remember correctly, he was like, downloading's hard.
[4629.62 → 4631.62] So, you know.
[4631.62 → 4632.62] I don't even think he's...
[4632.62 → 4635.62] But, pretty cool.
[4635.62 → 4636.62] Yeah.
[4636.62 → 4640.62] So far I've had to get Flow plane into military zones and Antarctica.
[4640.62 → 4641.62] So, sweet.
[4642.62 → 4643.62] Great.
[4643.62 → 4644.62] Seems legit.
[4644.62 → 4645.62] You know, it works.
[4645.62 → 4646.62] Willy Lane says, wish I could have made it.
[4646.62 → 4648.62] Will the talks be archived anywhere?
[4648.62 → 4650.62] I believe we're going to archive them on Flow plane.
[4650.62 → 4651.62] Cool.
[4651.62 → 4654.62] Now I can answer the...
[4654.62 → 4655.62] I've been getting that question all day.
[4655.62 → 4658.62] Because people are like, there's so much stuff to do.
[4658.62 → 4661.62] I'm trying to go do stuff instead of necessarily watch all the panels.
[4661.62 → 4663.62] They've watched some panels, but they want to see the other panels.
[4663.62 → 4664.62] So, it's cool that we can watch.
[4664.62 → 4665.62] Are you staying to game tonight?
[4665.62 → 4666.62] Yeah.
[4666.62 → 4667.62] Okay, cool.
[4667.62 → 4668.62] I think...
[4668.62 → 4669.62] Yeah.
[4669.62 → 4670.62] I think I'm going to hang out for a bit.
[4670.62 → 4673.62] I actually bailed on my Backstreet Boys concert, so...
[4673.62 → 4674.62] I was going to ask.
[4674.62 → 4675.62] Yeah.
[4675.62 → 4676.62] No Backstreet Boys.
[4676.62 → 4677.62] That's a big move.
[4677.62 → 4680.62] Well, there's a creator dinner tonight, and I figured I can either hang out with
[4680.62 → 4687.62] internet famous people like face to face, or I can sit in an audience in front of real famous people.
[4687.62 → 4688.62] Right.
[4688.62 → 4689.62] Yeah.
[4689.62 → 4690.62] Or at least they were famous at some point.
[4690.62 → 4691.62] Yeah.
[4691.62 → 4692.62] Yeah.
[4692.62 → 4695.62] We should bore everyone and play Anna up here.
[4695.62 → 4696.62] Yeah.
[4696.62 → 4697.62] I know, right?
[4697.62 → 4699.62] Everyone would be like, oh, I'm falling asleep.
[4699.62 → 4702.62] Midland1072 says, you guys should have a live audience more often.
[4702.62 → 4708.62] You know, we would, but it's so hard to bring people from, you know, Europe, you know, East Coast, United States.
[4708.62 → 4709.62] There's, yeah.
[4709.62 → 4710.62] Australia.
[4710.62 → 4711.62] There's, yeah.
[4711.62 → 4712.62] Exactly.
[4712.62 → 4713.62] Australia.
[4713.62 → 4714.62] There's people here from everywhere.
[4714.62 → 4715.62] New Zealand for sure.
[4715.62 → 4716.62] I know New Zealand is represented.
[4716.62 → 4717.62] Yeah.
[4717.62 → 4718.62] Thanks guys.
[4718.62 → 4719.62] What is Raid 10?
[4719.62 → 4720.62] You know what?
[4720.62 → 4723.62] We have a tech quickie video for you on that topic.
[4723.62 → 4724.62] Go ahead and check it out.
[4724.62 → 4725.62] It's Raid 1 and 0.
[4725.62 → 4726.62] Yes.
[4726.62 → 4727.62] It's them, but together.
[4727.62 → 4728.62] Raid 10.
[4728.62 → 4732.62] Also known as Raid 01, I guess, except no, because that would be confusing.
[4732.62 → 4733.62] All right.
[4733.62 → 4735.62] That's pretty much it.
[4735.62 → 4740.62] We can do, tell you what, we'll do two live extra super chats.
[4740.62 → 4741.62] Oh.
[4741.62 → 4743.62] How are we going to organize that?
[4743.62 → 4744.62] Okay.
[4744.62 → 4745.62] There's one.
[4745.62 → 4746.62] Volunteer.
[4746.62 → 4747.62] All right.
[4747.62 → 4748.62] You know what?
[4748.62 → 4749.62] You two.
[4749.62 → 4750.62] Yeah.
[4750.62 → 4751.62] Come on up guys.
[4751.62 → 4752.62] Live, live super chats.
[4752.62 → 4753.62] All right.
[4753.62 → 4754.62] Make it super.
[4754.62 → 4755.62] Give us money.
[4755.62 → 4756.62] I'm kidding.
[4756.62 → 4757.62] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[4757.62 → 4758.62] You've done enough.
[4758.62 → 4759.62] Okay.
[4759.62 → 4760.62] I've got a lot.
[4760.62 → 4761.62] Is it on?
[4761.62 → 4762.62] I don't know.
[4762.62 → 4763.62] Oh, there we go.
[4763.62 → 4764.62] Aha.
[4764.62 → 4778.62] What interest do you guys have in researching all the increasing technology in the cannabis
[4778.62 → 4779.62] department?
[4779.62 → 4780.62] Wow.
[4780.62 → 4781.62] That's an edgy question.
[4781.62 → 4782.62] Thank you.
[4782.62 → 4789.62] So, yeah, no, yeah, I can actually, I actually can address that.
[4789.62 → 4795.62] So we, we looked at doing a tour of a cannabis growing facility here in Canada.
[4795.62 → 4802.62] And we basically, the reason that we haven't done it yet is that, because there is some really,
[4802.62 → 4804.62] really cool tech in that space.
[4804.62 → 4805.62] There is actually a lot of very interesting tech.
[4805.62 → 4807.62] And there's some surprisingly big companies working on it.
[4807.62 → 4808.62] Yes.
[4808.62 → 4809.62] So there's some really cool tech.
[4809.62 → 4813.62] And the reason that we haven't done it is that with what's going on in the States right
[4813.62 → 4818.62] now and stopping people at the border who have anything to do with the cannabis industry,
[4818.62 → 4828.62] I couldn't afford to have a video out there of me seemingly, even if I'm not promoting it, even if I'm just there to cover the tech, which is what would be, what I would be there for.
[4828.62 → 4837.62] And I can't have there been any mistaking me for being some kind of cannabis promoter because I really need to be able to go down to the States to conduct meetings and things.
[4837.62 → 4838.62] So that's one of the reasons.
[4838.62 → 4853.62] And the other reason is that unless we could find a sponsor for the video, we would have a very difficult time paying for the trip because we're certainly not going to be getting any AdSense from YouTube on a video that has anything to do with cannabis.
[4853.62 → 4859.62] So it's more, it's less of a personal interest issue, and it's more of just a business logistical issue.
[4859.62 → 4863.62] If you ever settle the legal, I represent a cannabis company that would like your attention.
[4863.62 → 4866.62] Okay. All right. Sounds good. All right. You're up.
[4870.62 → 4872.62] You never know what people are going to ask live, right?
[4872.62 → 4874.62] Yeah. Never happening again.
[4874.62 → 4877.62] What do you think of goat sex? I don't know.
[4879.62 → 4881.62] That's right.
[4882.62 → 4886.62] I believe you've talked about Channel Super Fun on a previous ranch show.
[4886.62 → 4890.62] So...
[4890.62 → 4892.62] The man!
[4893.62 → 4894.62] Oh, okay.
[4894.62 → 4897.62] LTTtstore.com. You know, go check out the merch.
[4897.62 → 4899.62] Yeah, thanks. Thanks. You have to pimp it, right?
[4900.62 → 4905.62] So the question is, well, it wasn't really a question. It was more of a statement.
[4905.62 → 4909.62] It was, I believe you've talked about Channel Super Fun.
[4909.62 → 4915.62] And yes, I actually have talked about Channel Super Fun a little bit lately.
[4916.62 → 4924.62] We hired some additional writers who are supposed to take some of the burden off me because the big thing with Channel Super Fun is that we haven't had the resources to really do it properly.
[4924.62 → 4927.62] And if we're not going to resurrect it properly, we aren't going to bother.
[4927.62 → 4938.62] So it looks like there is a solid chance that sometime in the next few weeks to a couple of months, we are going to be resurrecting Channel Super Fun.
[4938.62 → 4950.62] And...
[4950.62 → 4953.62] Sounds like people really like watching us suck at things.
[4953.62 → 4954.62] I know.
[4954.62 → 4965.62] And they're going to get a spectacular opportunity to do so because one of the first videos back, if not the first, is actually inspired by one of our long-time LTX attendees.
[4965.62 → 4966.62] His name's John.
[4966.62 → 4975.62] And he's a member of the Canadian Para badminton team and has invited us to come get in some wheelchairs and try to play against them.
[4975.62 → 4976.62] Yeah.
[4977.62 → 4979.62] So there you have it, guys.
[4979.62 → 4981.62] We've got the invitation.
[4981.62 → 4994.62] We have not quite settled on a date for the shoot, but it would appear as though Channel Super Fun is coming back with kind of bit of a Channel Super Fun slash Nerd Sports kind of vibe for the first episode.
[4994.62 → 4996.62] And then we're going to kind of take it from there.
[4996.62 → 5004.62] And like I will say, not to inflate this man's ego even more than it is, but if you've ever seen him play badminton, it's actually insane.
[5004.62 → 5006.62] He's ridiculously good at badminton, but he'll be in a wheelchair.
[5006.62 → 5008.62] And that is actually something I'm really interested in.
[5008.62 → 5010.62] My upper body strength ain't great.
[5010.62 → 5015.62] I can wave around an 83 gram racket.
[5015.62 → 5020.62] But moving my 160 pound self, that's a little more challenging.
[5020.62 → 5021.62] Yeah, absolutely.
[5021.62 → 5022.62] I have a question.
[5022.62 → 5023.62] Yeah, sure.
[5023.62 → 5025.62] Live super chat from me.
[5025.62 → 5026.62] Five bucks.
[5026.62 → 5028.62] I just, you know what, just...
[5028.62 → 5030.62] Any money you have, I gave to you.
[5030.62 → 5031.62] Yeah, yeah.
[5031.62 → 5032.62] Take the lot.
[5032.62 → 5033.62] You can, whatever.
[5033.62 → 5034.62] Okay, so...
[5035.62 → 5036.62] Question I've had a lot.
[5036.62 → 5037.62] Yeah.
[5037.62 → 5038.62] And I don't actually really know.
[5038.62 → 5039.62] Last question.
[5039.62 → 5040.62] But, yes.
[5040.62 → 5041.62] Yes.
[5041.62 → 5045.62] But I've been saying to everybody, I don't know, let's let them get LTX done.
[5045.62 → 5047.62] Because I'm sure that's taken a lot of LMG work.
[5047.62 → 5048.62] It's been a crazy event.
[5048.62 → 5050.62] Everyone's done a really great job.
[5050.62 → 5051.62] Scrapyard Wars.
[5051.62 → 5053.62] Scrapyard Wars is coming back.
[5053.62 → 5054.62] Yeah!
[5054.62 → 5055.62] Yeah!
[5055.62 → 5056.62] Yeah!
[5056.62 → 5057.62] Yeah!
[5057.62 → 5058.62] Yeah!
[5058.62 → 5059.62] Yeah!
[5059.62 → 5060.62] Yeah!
[5060.62 → 5061.62] Yeah!
[5061.62 → 5065.62] So, I don't know the shoot date, but we do know the challenge.
[5065.62 → 5072.62] It's 3v3, and instead of coming down to benchmarks at the end of the season, it's going to come down to gaming performance.
[5072.62 → 5073.62] Okay.
[5073.62 → 5074.62] Okay.
[5074.62 → 5075.62] So there's going to be...
[5075.62 → 5076.62] Okay.
[5076.62 → 5078.62] You're going to have to build three full of rigs.
[5078.62 → 5079.62] Three?
[5079.62 → 5080.62] Three rigs per team.
[5080.62 → 5081.62] Okay.
[5081.62 → 5082.62] So, six total rigs.
[5082.62 → 5086.62] This is Scrapyard Wars Land Centre Edition, basically.
[5086.62 → 5087.62] Oh!
[5087.62 → 5088.62] Okay?
[5088.62 → 5089.62] Now...
[5089.62 → 5090.62] So, wait.
[5090.62 → 5100.62] The way that it's going to work is you're going to have like a qualification round, where you're going to take all six contestants and have them play against each other on equal footing.
[5100.62 → 5104.62] So we can determine fair teams from a gaming skill level standpoint.
[5104.62 → 5105.62] Okay.
[5105.62 → 5111.62] Then, what we're going to do is we're going to take those equal teams that everyone has to agree is fair.
[5111.62 → 5112.62] Okay.
[5112.62 → 5114.62] And we're going to give them a budget.
[5114.62 → 5116.62] It's going to be a crappy budget.
[5117.62 → 5120.62] We're talking like bank land centre edition.
[5120.62 → 5121.62] Nice.
[5121.62 → 5122.62] Nice.
[5122.62 → 5123.62] Not only will each...
[5123.62 → 5124.62] So every BYOC.
[5124.62 → 5125.62] Yeah.
[5125.62 → 5132.62] So not only will each player on each team have to have a gaming tower, they will need to have a monitor.
[5132.62 → 5134.62] They will need to have a keyboard.
[5134.62 → 5137.62] They will need to have a mouse and a headset and a desk.
[5137.62 → 5138.62] This is not a scrapyard.
[5138.62 → 5139.62] A desk!
[5139.62 → 5140.62] And somewhere to sit.
[5140.62 → 5141.62] Okay.
[5141.62 → 5142.62] Can I be a desk?
[5142.62 → 5144.62] Oh, I guess I have to play as well.
[5144.62 → 5149.62] So at the end, so we're going to basically set out some ground rules.
[5149.62 → 5150.62] Okay.
[5150.62 → 5158.62] And we might not require teams to have a chair for every player, but we will certainly require that your knees are at a 90-degree angle while you compete.
[5159.62 → 5160.62] Okay.
[5160.62 → 5162.62] So you're like shaking, trying to play.
[5162.62 → 5163.62] Okay.
[5163.62 → 5164.62] So you're going to have to...
[5164.62 → 5170.62] So the teams are going to have to decide between things like a decent mouse and a better graphics card.
[5170.62 → 5171.62] Or a mouse at all.
[5171.62 → 5175.62] Having a headset so that they can hear the game or having a chair.
[5175.62 → 5179.62] Or having like one person who can hear, and they just like yell at everyone else.
[5179.62 → 5180.62] Someone's coming!
[5180.62 → 5186.62] Investing heavily in one player to carry the team and having the other two barely able to load the map.
[5186.62 → 5189.62] Or trying to build balanced rigs for everyone.
[5190.62 → 5193.62] It's going to be a real challenge for us to film.
[5193.62 → 5194.62] Okay.

[5196.62 → 5197.62] Yeah, that's a lot.
[5197.62 → 5202.62] We hope that it's going to be entertaining watching us suffer.

[5203.62 → 5205.62] Oh yeah, we've totally got to play some Left 4 Dead.
[5205.62 → 5206.62] That would be so perfect for this.
[5206.62 → 5207.62] I'm super down.
[5207.62 → 5208.62] Alright.
[5208.62 → 5209.62] So that's it for the WAN show today.

[5210.62 → 5211.62] Different bat time.
[5211.62 → 5212.62] Same bat channel.

[5262.64 → 5265.60] And thanks for making this all possible.
[5265.84 → 5267.56] It couldn't possibly happen without you.

[5268.76 → 5269.14] Good night.
[5269.26 → 5270.00] Good night, everyone.
[5270.36 → 5271.88] Except those of you going to the BYOC.
[5272.28 → 5273.36] You guys don't have a night.
