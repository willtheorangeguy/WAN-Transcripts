[0.00 → 6.96] ...for example, where we do not in fact allow political discussion, regardless of which side you personally lean towards.
[7.30 → 7.46] Yeah.
[8.66 → 15.60] And we also said that Blizzard should not have had any consequences for the participants
[15.60 → 21.36] because we didn't feel like anyone had been appropriately warned.
[21.50 → 24.10] Something that I had wanted to discuss afterward.
[24.50 → 26.84] Okay, so they were appropriately warned.
[27.28 → 27.92] How appropriately?
[27.92 → 29.38] They knew something was going to happen.
[29.38 → 30.54] Yeah, but that's different.
[31.20 → 38.38] If I speed against a highway sign, I know that my ticket is going to be 157 Canadian dollars with three points against my license.
[38.58 → 39.50] That's really specific.
[39.74 → 40.70] Did you recently get a ticket?
[41.34 → 43.02] No, I just approximated.
[43.02 → 43.42] Okay, okay.
[43.42 → 44.26] I gave it exactly.
[44.72 → 50.40] The point I was trying to make, giving an exact number, is that if I read the Motor Vehicle Act,
[50.88 → 53.64] I know exactly what the consequences are going to be.
[53.72 → 55.74] Now, obviously, there's some nuance there.
[55.82 → 57.06] There's some interpretation there.
[57.06 → 65.34] If I was speeding against a highway sign while there was literally a school bus full of children trying to cross the road,
[65.34 → 68.60] and I don't, you know, yield to them.
[68.60 → 68.92] For some reason.
[69.22 → 74.92] Well, then I'm also probably going to get hit with reckless driving, endangerment, blah, blah, blah.
[75.00 → 76.18] There's a bunch of other stuff.
[76.26 → 81.16] So, no, it's not as cut and dried as here's the offence and here's the exact consequence.
[81.16 → 89.90] But Blizzard doesn't have a Motor Vehicle Act, and so they clearly didn't lay out, okay, well, if you deviate from the talking points,
[90.38 → 91.50] yes, it was a great match.
[92.08 → 93.30] Yeah, a lot of respect for my opponent.
[93.42 → 94.04] They played hard.
[94.92 → 95.84] This is an honour.
[96.14 → 96.84] Thanks, Mom and Dad.
[96.90 → 97.10] Bye.
[97.10 → 97.14] Bye.
[97.62 → 107.34] You know, like if they don't have a menu of consequences, then you can't run around basically destroying people's livelihoods.
[107.42 → 110.14] That's maybe a part that you guys also missed on the stream.
[110.22 → 112.90] Those of us who are like, yeah, you guys are like super pro-China, pro-Blizzard.
[112.90 → 120.56] We were talking about how destructive this was to not just the streamer, but also the casters that were involved in this heavy-handed punishment.
[120.56 → 127.62] And trying to suggest ways that you can support them in the meantime while they're banned because Blizzard reduced the ban from 12 months to 6 months,
[127.70 → 129.38] but that could potentially ruin someone's career.
[129.48 → 131.54] Okay, Enrico makes a very stupid point.
[131.96 → 139.62] You're treating critics of China like any other much shallower critics of like sports, I don't know, comes off as insensitive and pro-China.
[141.26 → 141.56] No.
[142.10 → 142.76] We're not.
[142.90 → 147.96] Again, we're not necessarily the greatest political commentators out there.
[148.02 → 150.94] I don't know how to explain it to you any more clearly, unfortunately.
[151.72 → 156.08] We said standing on the side of Hong Kong is the right side to stand on.
[156.26 → 157.36] I don't remember exactly how it was worded.
[157.44 → 161.98] Which critics of China did we treat as what?
[161.98 → 164.62] We also actually haven't commented at all about critics of China.
[165.32 → 165.60] Nope.
[165.66 → 165.94] You did.
[166.32 → 166.62] How?
[167.00 → 167.12] When?
[167.16 → 168.32] One of the tweets earlier.
[169.32 → 170.28] One of the tweets earlier?
[170.28 → 170.76] Okay.
[171.30 → 174.04] Oh, but that's because it was an incorrect translation.
[175.54 → 175.94] Yeah.
[175.94 → 181.74] And we showed the correct translation, which is still, as was stated, horrible.
[182.38 → 182.62] Yes.
[182.66 → 183.14] But it's not.
[183.50 → 184.56] It was an incorrect.
[184.66 → 186.04] We should be mad about the right thing.
[186.22 → 187.14] That was what I was saying.
[187.46 → 188.76] Are we sure it was an incorrect translation?
[189.24 → 190.44] We're fairly sure.
[191.00 → 191.28] Okay.
[191.28 → 198.74] I have someone that I know that speaks Chinese that read it and translated it, and their translation
[198.74 → 204.84] was extremely similar to a translation that was posted by a random user in the Twitter thread.
[205.98 → 206.50] Yeah.
[206.70 → 209.52] So we're, like, pretty sure that one was more accurate.
[209.72 → 211.54] It's still, like, bad.
[211.66 → 212.64] And we said that.
[212.72 → 213.00] Yeah.
[213.00 → 218.22] It's just different, and I would rather people were angry about the right thing.
[218.34 → 218.50] Yeah.
[219.16 → 223.14] Because that makes your argument more irrefutable.
[223.26 → 224.00] It makes it stronger.
[224.12 → 224.88] It's a good thing.
[225.10 → 225.46] Yes.
[225.66 → 227.34] You want to be angry about the right thing.
[227.40 → 228.14] This will help you.
[228.64 → 231.26] I'm trying to help you.
[231.44 → 231.96] All right.
[231.96 → 234.64] So there you go, guys.
[236.66 → 238.04] Hope that was fun.
[238.40 → 244.08] In summary, Blizzard did the wrong thing.
[244.38 → 245.92] Lawful evil, like we said.
[246.18 → 248.22] Lawful evil, like we said.
[248.52 → 249.92] Were they within their rights?
[250.94 → 251.32] Yes.
[251.50 → 254.08] Not their social rights.
[254.50 → 255.40] I didn't say responsibilities.
[255.70 → 256.32] I said rights.
[256.50 → 256.64] Yes.
[256.68 → 257.76] They were within their rights.
[257.88 → 259.98] It is within the letter of the law.
[259.98 → 261.98] Did they do the responsible thing?
[262.50 → 262.94] No.
[263.74 → 265.14] Have they backtracked?
[265.40 → 265.76] Yes.
[265.76 → 266.08] Yes.
[266.30 → 267.60] Have they backtracked enough?
[268.06 → 268.68] That was coming.
[268.88 → 269.04] Yeah.
[269.18 → 269.54] No.
[269.76 → 270.02] Yeah.
[270.82 → 271.10] Yeah.
[271.30 → 272.58] Are we pro-China?
[273.34 → 273.82] No?
[274.02 → 274.10] No.
[274.84 → 276.30] I don't know why you thought that.
[276.34 → 277.90] I don't know where that idea comes from.
[277.92 → 281.62] We talked before the stream, like, all right.
[281.72 → 284.66] I don't know if going over there is going to be the wisest thing.
[284.66 → 289.96] Honestly, I haven't considered getting on a plane to China ever since Canada detained.
[290.98 → 291.66] What's her name?
[291.76 → 293.04] Hangmen something, I think.
[293.76 → 294.42] I don't remember her name.
[294.50 → 294.70] Yeah.
[294.82 → 297.22] Huawei's CFO, the daughter of the founder or whatever.
[297.62 → 305.24] I'm sitting here going, like, China's whole reaction to that was completely disproportionate
[305.24 → 310.70] and inappropriate because within the letter of the law, not just, like, within the letter
[310.70 → 315.60] of the law, like, there were some pretty clear and obvious reasons for her to be detained.
[315.60 → 321.96] And she clearly knew it because otherwise, why would she have gone through Vancouver for
[321.96 → 323.32] her connecting flight?
[324.96 → 330.98] Anywho, ever since then, like, it's been, I don't know.
[330.98 → 334.26] I don't know if I've ever said anything particularly defending China.
[334.62 → 335.64] I don't think so.
[336.28 → 341.92] Anyway, people will interpret whatever they want, but, and there's nothing I can really
[341.92 → 342.56] do about that.
[342.66 → 344.14] So then, why don't we move on?
[344.14 → 346.58] 柔ノ
[346.58 → 347.86] Oh, good.
[347.92 → 348.68] Our next topic.
[348.86 → 349.72] What a mess.
[349.88 → 352.98] Apple removes the Hong Kong protest app.
[353.12 → 354.18] Maybe we shouldn't talk about that.
[354.18 → 356.64] Oh, well, we promised we were going to talk about it, so here we are.
[356.64 → 362.56] Just a day after Chinese state media criticized Apple for allowing HK Map in its App Store,
[363.12 → 366.96] and a week after Apple flip-flopped on its initial decision to delist the app,
[367.06 → 369.10] the crowdsourced Map app has been removed,
[369.22 → 373.44] again sparking concerns that Apple is pandering to China's political regime.
[374.06 → 379.88] The app shares information on the location of pro-democracy protests and police activity in Hong Kong.
[380.42 → 383.94] Opponents of the app say that it enables rioters to commit violent acts,
[383.94 → 387.44] while supporters of the app say it helps people avoid police brutality.
[388.16 → 393.28] HK Map's creators say there's no evidence that the app has been used to target police or threaten public safety.
[393.72 → 401.46] They added that apps such as Waze, which use crowdsourced information to help users find where police are hanging around,
[402.14 → 405.28] are also still permitted on the App Store.
[405.78 → 408.14] In an internal letter, Tim Cooked explained, Tim Cooked?
[409.28 → 410.76] Depends on how badly this goes.
[410.76 → 411.76] Tim Cooked.
[413.94 → 415.28] Tim Cooked.
[415.28 → 416.20] I didn't expect that.
[416.32 → 416.72] That was pretty good.
[416.72 → 418.68] Explained Apple's reasons for pulling the app.
[420.00 → 423.30] It is no secret that technology can be used for good or for ill.
[423.48 → 424.48] This case is no different.
[425.04 → 430.36] Apple based its decision on credible information from both Hong Kong police and Apple users in Hong Kong
[430.36 → 434.38] that the app was used maliciously to target individual officers for violence
[434.38 → 437.90] and victimize individuals and property where no police are present.
[438.90 → 441.86] This use put the app in violation of Hong Kong law.
[441.86 → 448.26] Similarly, widespread abuse clearly violates our App Store guidelines barring personal harm.
[448.72 → 454.08] Apple made the decision a day after a Chinese state newspaper wrote a commentary criticizing the company for approving the app.
[454.28 → 459.96] In this case, we thoroughly reviewed them, and we believe this decision best protects our users.
[461.42 → 463.28] HK Map is still available on desktop.
[463.28 → 464.86] Not that it's the same scale.
[465.38 → 465.68] Yes.
[465.94 → 471.02] But there was news that came out around when Pokémon Go first launched.
[471.52 → 476.88] Because people were using the Pokémon Go stops as mugging locations.
[477.14 → 477.40] Yeah.
[477.54 → 481.02] Because they knew people with phones and probably battery banks and potentially other...
[481.02 → 483.44] Hanging around there and probably not paying too close attention.
[483.74 → 484.20] And you could...
[484.20 → 485.44] Busy chasing Pikachu's.
[485.66 → 486.88] Mug them or swipe their phone or whatever.
[487.00 → 487.12] Yeah.
[487.12 → 487.86] And that was like...
[487.86 → 490.92] That was in the news, I believe, a fair number of times.
[491.00 → 491.16] Yeah.
[491.26 → 493.16] So where was the bend for Pokémon Go?
[495.14 → 496.60] It was used for...
[496.60 → 497.60] They say...
[497.60 → 499.24] Where's their official statement on it?
[499.58 → 501.42] If it's used to whatever, whatever.
[501.66 → 501.88] Yeah.
[502.90 → 504.06] Protects our users.
[504.70 → 505.44] Something, something.
[505.58 → 506.68] Barring personal harm.
[506.84 → 507.06] Yeah.
[508.36 → 509.46] So, you know.
[509.80 → 510.12] It's just...
[510.12 → 510.68] There's...
[510.68 → 512.80] So there's a clear double standard here.
[512.84 → 513.02] Yeah.
[513.10 → 514.44] It's basically what's going on.
[514.48 → 519.68] And actually, this is a fair bit more cut and dried than the Blizzard case, quite honestly.
[520.34 → 523.96] Because with Blizzard, they can make the argument...
[523.96 → 527.12] Now, Blizzard did a very poor job.
[527.12 → 537.22] If their actual intent was to keep political discussion out of their sporting event, which, okay, I can at least understand and sympathize with,
[537.22 → 541.44] they did an extremely poor job of seeming unbiased about it.
[542.74 → 543.54] Terrible.
[543.68 → 544.66] Like, the worst.
[544.74 → 547.00] I can't think of a worse way that they could have handled it.
[547.42 → 553.58] But if that was their intent, and they had done something, say, for example, like warning everyone involved,
[553.92 → 559.26] making sure that the entire community knows, look, this isn't going to be tolerated no matter what side of the fence you stand on.
[559.26 → 567.76] If you are a pro-China winner of the next Hearthstone tournament, don't you dare say anything responding to what happened here,
[567.88 → 568.96] because you will be banned.
[569.18 → 573.40] If that had been their stance, I would have said, okay, fair enough.
[573.64 → 574.38] It's your platform.
[575.08 → 580.02] Those people can talk about whatever they want to talk about while they're on some other platform.
[580.16 → 580.26] Yeah.
[580.48 → 581.80] Twitter or Twitch or whatever.
[581.96 → 582.68] Actually, I don't know.
[582.74 → 585.26] Does Twitch have any guidelines with respect to political discussion?
[585.26 → 585.74] I have no idea.
[585.86 → 587.70] But it's not Blizzard's concern.
[587.70 → 590.70] It's not Blizzard's concern because it's someone else's freaking platform.
[590.90 → 590.98] Yeah.
[591.22 → 599.56] Here, this, I don't necessarily agree with Mr. Cook's terminology here.
[599.76 → 600.02] Yeah.
[601.26 → 604.08] Clearly violates our App Store guidelines.
[604.20 → 606.32] Your App Store guidelines, quite honestly, suck.
[606.80 → 609.24] I'm sure, yeah, that's really, it's way too vague.
[609.40 → 611.54] I'm sure, like, Tinder has been used.
[612.46 → 613.26] You think?
[613.38 → 614.58] For horrible things.
[614.90 → 615.62] Of course, obviously.
[615.62 → 617.28] I don't know if they're all the related apps.
[617.38 → 620.00] Sorry, Tinder, but you're the most well-known one that I know of.
[622.34 → 623.02] Similar things.
[623.08 → 623.64] There's plenty of them.
[623.70 → 625.02] I'm sure they've been used maliciously.
[625.22 → 630.72] Lots of apps have been used maliciously to whatever their definition was, was terrible.
[631.20 → 635.20] So, like, they need to be more specific about that if they want to try to enforce this.
[636.38 → 637.68] Oh, our chat wasn't working.
[637.68 → 639.74] To the scale at which they were enforcing it, at least.
[644.36 → 648.16] Blizzard banned someone who was idolized and had reach in China.
[648.38 → 651.54] Others in the tournament in the USA had spoken out with no reaction.
[654.34 → 654.74] Okay.
[655.14 → 655.40] Yeah.
[655.60 → 655.94] All right.
[655.94 → 658.38] I'm just checking to me.
[658.46 → 662.58] The stream health says red, so I was just refreshing the page to get things working.
[663.26 → 664.18] I have to take this with me?
[664.24 → 664.74] Keep it in your bag.
[665.36 → 665.72] Wow.
[665.90 → 667.60] The airport is going to love this.
[667.78 → 668.30] Yeah, really.
[669.54 → 672.00] You should almost attach something random to it.
[672.48 → 672.84] Yeah.
[673.14 → 676.06] I am going to get extra screening because of this.
[676.12 → 676.80] You know this, right?
[677.10 → 677.46] Whatever.
[677.62 → 678.26] I wasn't the one.
[678.46 → 679.48] Yeah, yeah, it's fine.
[679.52 → 680.10] I'll take it.
[680.16 → 680.80] I'll take it.
[680.80 → 682.86] Put it in your carry-on for your check.
[682.86 → 683.34] Yeah.
[684.28 → 686.16] You know they x-ray those too, right?
[686.58 → 686.88] Yeah.
[687.18 → 688.80] I'm totally getting questioned.
[689.46 → 691.10] It's a camera handle, okay?
[691.24 → 691.98] It's a camera handle.
[692.06 → 692.26] Yeah.
[693.02 → 699.30] So, in summary, oh, Google apparently, just in case you were hoping that our other benevolent
[699.30 → 706.10] mobile device overlord was standing up for freedom of speech, Google has also removed
[706.10 → 710.70] a pro-Hong Kong protester app game called The Revolution of Our Times from the Play Store
[710.70 → 715.74] due to a policy that bans capitalizing on sensitive events such as attempting to make money from
[715.74 → 718.04] serious ongoing conflicts or tragedies through a game.
[718.14 → 718.22] Okay.
[718.26 → 719.12] That's pretty specific.
[719.26 → 722.04] Actually, no, that kind of makes sense to me.
[722.22 → 722.58] Never mind.
[724.60 → 730.80] Whereas the one on the App Store is clearly designed for people to coordinate their efforts
[730.80 → 732.84] in order to accomplish something.
[732.84 → 733.84] Yeah.
[735.36 → 735.86] All right.
[736.16 → 737.28] Well, way to go, Apple.
[738.28 → 742.36] But hey, at least your headquarters is 100% renewable energy, right?
[743.16 → 749.10] In lighter news, let's just jump to the Steam one because it's just warmer.
[749.58 → 750.36] It's just better.
[751.36 → 752.72] Things are greater there.
[752.78 → 754.36] I'm just going to talk about it because he's reading chat.
[755.16 → 758.24] Steam to make local multiplayer games work online.
[758.24 → 762.46] Steam has announced a surprise new feature coming as soon as October 21st.
[762.48 → 763.32] That's awesome.
[763.98 → 765.72] Remote play together.
[766.14 → 770.26] This feature will transform any local multiplayer video game into an online one
[770.26 → 775.00] by having the primary player stream their game up to three other friends,
[775.12 → 777.82] meaning that the other players won't have to buy a copy to join in.
[777.82 → 778.02] Okay.
[778.12 → 780.44] Can I explain why I was mad about this when I read the headline?
[780.48 → 781.18] I was wondering.
[781.32 → 781.56] Okay.
[781.66 → 782.46] I was just letting you read.
[782.46 → 788.68] I was mad because I interpreted it transforming any local multiplayer video game
[788.68 → 793.46] into an online one as a way of adding fresh layers of DRM
[793.46 → 799.14] to the local multiplayer features of games that are available on Steam.
[800.00 → 800.82] My bad.
[801.00 → 801.30] Okay.
[801.44 → 802.60] That's not what this is.
[802.66 → 802.86] Yeah.
[802.86 → 803.92] This is super cool.
[803.92 → 807.80] This is basically like Cali, but like 2019 edition.
[807.98 → 809.58] This stream, we have to be super careful.
[809.80 → 809.82] Yeah.
[809.90 → 810.34] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[810.34 → 813.24] The redefining stances over and over again.
[813.62 → 813.98] So...
[813.98 → 816.06] But don't interpret this as being pro-valve.
[816.40 → 816.84] Yes.
[817.02 → 817.16] Yes.
[817.16 → 819.22] Because as far as we can tell, they're kind of buttheads.
[819.22 → 820.70] And we speak out against them all the time.
[821.12 → 821.36] Okay.
[821.76 → 823.10] But this is a cool feature.
[824.10 → 825.74] I don't know what to do anymore.
[825.80 → 826.08] Ah!
[827.08 → 828.80] Go to LTTstore.com.
[828.86 → 829.44] Drink water.
[829.56 → 830.16] It's good for you.
[831.30 → 833.46] We have new water bottle colours.
[833.82 → 835.26] Don't drink so much that you drown.
[835.42 → 836.30] That's not what we're saying.
[836.42 → 838.80] We have white and black, and we have gold and black.
[838.80 → 839.34] Woo!
[839.48 → 844.02] The gold and black has the stealth, the stealth, the lettering and the white one has the black
[844.02 → 844.52] lettering.
[844.52 → 844.90] Yeah.
[845.22 → 845.54] Okay.
[845.64 → 845.84] Yeah.
[846.04 → 846.90] Drinking water is good.
[846.98 → 847.28] All right.
[847.38 → 852.46] So the host computer basically renders the game while also shouldering two other burdens.
[852.46 → 857.52] So it has to stream the game to the other participants, and it has to juggle all the incoming buttons
[857.52 → 858.78] and commands from the other players.
[858.92 → 862.74] So this is going to be a whole new level of host advantage.
[863.12 → 863.22] Yes.
[863.36 → 863.62] Wow.
[864.08 → 869.00] The feature will support a 1080p video signal sent to the other players at 60 frames a second
[869.00 → 875.62] and all players must have at least a 10 megabit per second connection for a successful low
[875.62 → 876.46] latency game.
[876.78 → 880.04] I wonder how many games are going to stop including local multiplayer because of this.
[880.38 → 882.20] What games include local multiplayer anymore?
[882.26 → 882.96] Yeah, it's a good point.
[883.38 → 884.52] Like pretty much nothing.
[884.64 → 885.74] Some random mini-games.
[885.86 → 889.66] So I was firing up the menu in Supreme Commander, which I was playing the other day.
[889.80 → 890.04] Yes.
[890.04 → 892.48] And I was like, oh, right, local multiplayer because I saw it.
[892.70 → 893.76] Oh, yeah, that.
[894.40 → 900.84] So fun fact, we're doing part two of our high refresh rate monitor latency exploration.
[901.26 → 901.42] Yeah.
[901.78 → 903.48] I don't know if I've announced this yet.
[904.18 → 904.98] Featuring Shroud.
[905.34 → 905.56] Ah.
[906.26 → 906.94] I don't know.
[907.28 → 907.44] Yeah.
[907.58 → 907.74] Woo!
[908.14 → 908.38] Yeah.
[908.74 → 909.80] So I'm going down to LA.
[910.02 → 911.92] So many people named him after that video.
[912.00 → 912.22] Yeah, I know.
[912.32 → 912.82] Including myself.
[912.96 → 914.14] So many people.
[914.14 → 915.04] We worked with Nvidia.
[915.46 → 916.28] We made it happen.
[916.58 → 916.66] Nice.
[917.44 → 919.12] So it's going to be pretty freaking cool.
[919.12 → 921.32] We are dramatically expanding the scope of the WhatsApp.
[921.60 → 922.00] The camera.
[922.40 → 922.84] The what?
[925.62 → 926.64] I don't know what you're talking about.
[926.70 → 927.30] Your bag.
[927.44 → 927.86] In my bag.
[928.04 → 928.62] I'm trying to be.
[928.88 → 929.30] The grip.
[930.54 → 931.64] You're going somewhere.
[931.72 → 932.16] Oh, yeah, yeah.
[932.24 → 932.40] Right.
[932.46 → 934.14] That's why I was upset about putting this in my bag.
[934.20 → 934.80] I'm going to be travelling.
[935.56 → 935.58] So.
[935.74 → 937.08] Like related?
[937.36 → 937.82] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[937.84 → 938.12] For that.
[938.14 → 938.72] There we go.
[938.80 → 939.02] Yeah, yeah.
[939.42 → 939.70] Sorry.
[939.70 → 941.02] Oh, I'm doing other stuff down there, too.
[941.04 → 941.78] I'm on for like a week.
[941.78 → 942.08] I just didn't know if you went.
[942.18 → 942.58] Oh, wow.
[942.68 → 942.98] Yeah, yeah.
[942.98 → 944.04] That's only a one-day shoot.
[944.16 → 944.42] Okay.
[944.46 → 945.62] Are you on next week's WAN show?
[946.00 → 946.28] Yeah.
[946.56 → 946.86] Okay.
[946.86 → 947.42] Yeah, I'll be back.
[948.04 → 950.30] So anyway, anyway, so we're working with Shroud.
[950.38 → 951.44] It's going to be freaking awesome.
[951.68 → 953.18] I forget what the point of this was.
[953.22 → 954.14] What was I talking about?
[955.40 → 956.44] Local multiplayer.
[957.66 → 958.42] Supreme commander.
[959.92 → 961.20] Supreme commander made you think of it.
[961.40 → 961.80] I don't know.
[961.96 → 962.98] Why am I talking about Shroud?
[963.90 → 964.54] There's a reason.
[964.60 → 965.02] NVIDIA.
[965.24 → 966.10] Guys, help me out here.
[966.12 → 966.42] Steam.
[966.94 → 967.14] Yeah.
[967.28 → 968.94] No, no, no.
[969.18 → 971.64] Games not including local multiplayer potentially in the future.
[971.96 → 972.60] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[972.60 → 972.84] Right.
[973.04 → 973.30] Okay.
[973.30 → 979.98] So one of the tests uses an Overwatch map that's like a flick shot test.
[980.04 → 980.26] Okay.
[980.62 → 980.88] Okay.
[980.94 → 983.94] So you've got 0.45 seconds to hit a target.
[984.26 → 984.60] What's up?
[986.62 → 987.06] What?
[987.52 → 989.44] Just don't talk about the whole thing.
[989.72 → 990.60] I'm going to talk about this.
[990.62 → 991.72] There's a lot of feedback.
[991.72 → 997.98] So one of the tests is an Overwatch custom map that is like a flick shot test.
[998.08 → 998.26] Okay.
[998.26 → 1004.30] And one of the things that we discovered is that if you're on a Wi-Fi connection, it don't work too well.
[1004.68 → 1004.96] Ah.
[1005.18 → 1013.82] Because you can't just like load up a custom map like locally and just play on a custom map.
[1013.92 → 1015.76] Like you're still connected through a server.
[1016.48 → 1017.96] So there you go.
[1018.12 → 1019.38] I thought that was fascinating.
[1019.64 → 1019.78] Yeah.
[1019.78 → 1020.02] Yeah.
[1020.12 → 1023.82] I know the Star Craft community wanted, was the Star Craft community?
[1023.90 → 1024.32] I think so.
[1024.80 → 1028.00] Wanted LAN support for a long time.
[1028.46 → 1032.94] Because like at tournaments, like they'd lose connection to the Blizzard servers mid-game.
[1033.16 → 1034.42] And it was like, uh.
[1034.90 → 1035.42] Okay.
[1035.56 → 1036.60] What do we do now?
[1036.70 → 1037.18] Thanks.
[1037.32 → 1038.10] Didn't need that.
[1038.32 → 1044.48] Do you feel like LAN parties are ultimately going to have to become retro game fests?
[1045.20 → 1051.22] Because there is literally no point in all being in the same room.
[1051.44 → 1053.72] I mean, other than the, you know, the camaraderie.
[1053.84 → 1055.98] Hey, you gotcha, you loser.
[1056.20 → 1057.06] You know, that kind of stuff.
[1057.70 → 1058.88] You know, other than that.
[1058.94 → 1059.70] So there's some stuff.
[1059.76 → 1060.60] In terms of game quality.
[1060.60 → 1062.18] Like a game called Squad.
[1062.46 → 1062.66] Yeah.
[1063.48 → 1066.80] Was a game that I really wanted to play with a bunch of my friends.
[1066.94 → 1067.86] We never ended up doing it.
[1067.92 → 1069.82] But a bunch of my friends in the LMG lounge.
[1069.82 → 1076.50] Because the communication and stuff that has to go on in that game is really fun to do kind of live and in person.
[1078.36 → 1079.24] But yeah.
[1079.56 → 1083.32] Most LAN's that I'm a part of turn into slug fests of old games.
[1083.88 → 1085.80] Which I'm completely okay with personally.
[1086.00 → 1086.18] Yep.
[1086.38 → 1087.08] I'm down for it.
[1087.36 → 1088.36] Hand Clock says, yep.
[1089.02 → 1090.92] LAN for SC2 still non-existent.
[1091.34 → 1091.58] Yeah.
[1091.72 → 1091.92] Okay.
[1092.02 → 1092.50] So it was that.
[1092.62 → 1092.74] Yeah.
[1092.78 → 1095.90] Well, I mean, the cold hard truth is it's because it's hard to DRM it.
[1095.90 → 1097.42] It's all there is to it.
[1097.42 → 1101.60] Because if you can play on a LAN, then you can get a cracked EXE.
[1101.62 → 1102.06] On.
[1102.38 → 1106.44] Of an older patch version of the game that doesn't have it fixed yet.
[1106.48 → 1107.90] And you can LAN it up.
[1108.48 → 1109.84] I mean, that's how we used to do it.
[1109.90 → 1110.18] No.
[1110.30 → 1110.48] No.
[1110.58 → 1111.26] It's only us.
[1113.60 → 1114.40] Excuse me.
[1115.56 → 1116.04] Wow.
[1116.46 → 1116.66] I.
[1117.60 → 1118.88] Well, this is awkward.
[1120.38 → 1121.22] Unlawful good.
[1121.92 → 1122.56] Unlawful good.
[1123.76 → 1124.56] I don't know.
[1124.56 → 1124.92] No.
[1124.92 → 1125.72] Never mind.
[1125.86 → 1126.60] Let's move on.
[1126.76 → 1127.48] Sponsor time.
[1127.80 → 1128.64] Unlawful neutral.
[1129.20 → 1129.52] Sure.
[1129.64 → 1129.76] Yeah.
[1129.80 → 1130.32] Let's go with that.
[1130.40 → 1130.52] Yeah.
[1130.70 → 1130.84] Yeah.
[1130.84 → 1131.20] All right.
[1131.58 → 1131.96] All right.
[1132.00 → 1138.56] So this video and none of the none of the none of the none of the things you have heard
[1138.56 → 1139.36] in it, but whatever.
[1139.44 → 1140.00] Don't worry about it.
[1140.02 → 1141.44] This video is brought to you by Moss.
[1141.92 → 1147.80] The Moss Black Pack is the organizer to keep you protected and well organized.
[1148.16 → 1148.76] Wait, what?
[1149.10 → 1149.88] Moss organizer.
[1150.00 → 1151.46] What even are these talking points?
[1151.52 → 1151.98] Don't worry about it.
[1151.98 → 1152.62] This is a great backpack.
[1152.84 → 1153.58] I actually use.
[1153.58 → 1155.04] Can I show everyone my favourite part?
[1155.14 → 1155.88] I do this every time.
[1156.30 → 1157.70] I use one of their older ones.
[1157.86 → 1159.16] I absolutely love it.
[1159.38 → 1162.84] Some of the features are sort of irrelevant, like the expanding feature.
[1162.92 → 1165.94] I don't care about that, but they have a great distribution of pockets.
[1166.22 → 1167.78] It's held up extremely well.
[1168.04 → 1168.82] It's comfortable.
[1168.82 → 1171.42] Look how easy it is to see the water bottle.
[1171.54 → 1173.26] The build quality of it is great.
[1173.38 → 1174.58] Because it's salt orange inside.
[1174.62 → 1176.06] Includes a five-year warranty.
[1176.06 → 1179.62] I don't know what else to tell you guys about it.
[1179.62 → 1186.26] Other than that, you can use offer code Linus Tech to get 15% off Moss products at mossorganizer.com.
[1186.34 → 1188.92] Ooh, and big news for Canadian shoppers.
[1189.14 → 1193.66] They just opened up their Amazon store at leg.GG slash Meowscarada.
[1193.78 → 1194.60] M-O-S Canada.
[1195.12 → 1196.66] And the code works there as well.
[1196.78 → 1198.14] So enjoy, guys.
[1198.52 → 1199.26] Freaking awesome bag.
[1199.30 → 1200.70] And they've got a bunch of other cool stuff, too.
[1200.70 → 1202.70] I really like their magnetic cable organizer.
[1202.96 → 1208.26] So it's just a little, like, sticky magnetic thing that if you have a cable that you only sometimes use,
[1208.48 → 1212.80] you throw it on there so that it won't be, like, flying all over the place or fall off your desk.
[1212.84 → 1217.00] And then you can just grab it and use it, like something like a phone charging cable or a mouse charging cable.
[1218.18 → 1218.92] Also, Honey.
[1219.36 → 1225.04] Honey is the free shopping tool that finds the best promo codes wherever you shop online at specific sites.
[1225.12 → 1227.32] They have some really other really cool features, too.
[1227.32 → 1234.70] So we were using Honey just to make a video totally unrelated to a Honey sponsorship the other day when we were...
[1234.70 → 1235.74] So here's one of the challenges.
[1236.34 → 1237.46] When you do a cheap...
[1237.46 → 1237.66] Whoops.
[1238.00 → 1243.76] When you do a cheap product roundup, like you do, you know, keyboards for less than $20,
[1244.32 → 1247.54] it's pretty straightforward to find all the keyboards that cost less than $20.
[1247.96 → 1252.34] But especially as you get up into mid-range where things cost, like, 50, 75 bucks,
[1252.34 → 1259.04] there's this gray area between products that are not discounted right now and cost $50,
[1259.56 → 1261.06] when normally they're, like, $30,
[1261.34 → 1267.64] and products that cost $100 but are on super mega promo down to $69.99 right now.
[1267.70 → 1269.60] And are sometimes permanently on that promo.
[1269.94 → 1270.18] Right?
[1270.38 → 1273.94] So you can end up with a really lopsided comparison...
[1273.94 → 1274.14] Yeah.
[1274.64 → 1276.96] ...by trying to look at a price band like that.
[1276.96 → 1278.96] So we used Honey's price history feature...
[1279.48 → 1279.72] Oh!
[1280.04 → 1285.96] ...and we designed our criteria to be that at some point in the last couple of months...
[1285.96 → 1286.42] It needs to have been...
[1286.42 → 1288.64] ...it had to hit that price at least three times.
[1288.98 → 1289.28] Okay.
[1289.46 → 1289.64] Cool.
[1289.94 → 1292.32] Because Honey also has price watching features.
[1292.60 → 1296.26] So if you were to use Honey, then if you're willing to be a little bit patient,
[1297.10 → 1300.40] and what we say is, okay, it has to hit that price sometimes,
[1300.40 → 1301.92] then you'll get a notification.
[1302.16 → 1302.42] Boom!
[1302.50 → 1303.10] You go ahead and buy it.
[1303.12 → 1303.78] I didn't actually know that.
[1303.80 → 1304.36] That's actually really cool.
[1304.36 → 1305.10] So it was a...
[1305.10 → 1305.62] I use Honey.
[1305.62 → 1310.58] Yeah, it was a great way for us to take some of that guesswork out of like,
[1310.62 → 1315.32] well, is this discounted or is this artificially inflated right now?
[1315.70 → 1321.44] And find a perfect mix of products that was like a fair $50 to $75 keyboard roundup.
[1321.58 → 1321.72] Yeah.
[1322.34 → 1324.04] So I've said a lot about how great Honey is.
[1324.10 → 1328.24] It works at tons of stores, and you can get it for free at joinhoney.com slash Linus.
[1329.44 → 1331.06] Also private internet access.
[1331.32 → 1333.86] PIA supports a variety of VPN protocols,
[1333.86 → 1335.78] actually on the subject of China,
[1335.78 → 1337.52] since we love talking about it so much today.
[1337.52 → 1340.60] I got a really great note from one of our other sponsors,
[1340.92 → 1344.14] who I'm not going to name, but they're over in China for business,
[1344.32 → 1346.66] which is a great reason to not name them right now.
[1346.88 → 1347.04] Yeah.
[1347.60 → 1349.60] They're over in China for business right now.
[1349.60 → 1351.76] And I got a Twitter DM that was like,
[1351.88 → 1354.98] yo, thanks for the tip on PIA.
[1355.46 → 1357.62] They're the only one that's working for me over there right now.
[1358.02 → 1360.52] To be clear, PIA doesn't always work over there.
[1360.90 → 1364.50] I've been over there at times, and it was intermittent or didn't work.
[1364.70 → 1366.16] But right now, they're working.
[1366.30 → 1367.72] I mean, it's always an arms race, right?
[1367.92 → 1369.56] Trying to get past the Great Firewall of China.
[1369.98 → 1372.96] Anyway, they've got a lot of other features that are separate from that,
[1372.96 → 1375.90] but it was just like one of those little moments like,
[1375.98 → 1378.96] hey, thanks for endorsing these guys because this is working out great.
[1379.68 → 1384.10] Their apps are available for Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Linux, and Google Chrome.
[1384.30 → 1388.28] They have over 3,000 bare metal servers in 44 locations across 28 countries.
[1388.52 → 1391.30] You can connect up to five devices at once with a single account.
[1391.84 → 1396.40] And you can check it out today at leg.GG slash PIA WAN.
[1396.58 → 1398.88] If you're into that sort of thing, they don't block tormenting,
[1398.98 → 1399.74] so there you go.
[1399.78 → 1400.20] Now you know.
[1401.52 → 1402.14] All right.
[1402.14 → 1406.10] They would be the one sponsor on today's show that does support the messaging in this episode.
[1406.78 → 1407.36] Yeah, yeah.
[1407.40 → 1407.88] I know, right?
[1409.40 → 1409.76] Yeah.
[1409.86 → 1411.44] PIA is going to be like, oh, yeah.
[1411.58 → 1413.02] No, this show seems fine.
[1413.18 → 1413.82] I'm glad to.
[1414.16 → 1417.04] I'm glad that, you know, we're associated with it.
[1417.58 → 1421.28] I mean, I actually don't know anything about Moss or Honey's standpoints.
[1421.30 → 1421.80] And you know what?
[1421.82 → 1422.42] I shouldn't.
[1422.48 → 1425.04] I think that's the biggest point that Luke was trying to make.
[1425.04 → 1425.34] Yes.
[1425.62 → 1429.14] That really got glossed over in the earlier parts of the show today.
[1429.28 → 1429.44] Yeah.
[1429.44 → 1429.98] All right.
[1430.20 → 1431.84] I want to talk about this Stadia thing.
[1431.84 → 1432.20] Okay.
[1432.50 → 1433.74] Can we do one more topic?
[1433.82 → 1434.12] Yes.
[1434.12 → 1434.64] Stadia thing?
[1434.70 → 1435.14] Okay.
[1436.06 → 1436.64] I know.
[1436.76 → 1437.54] We need to go.
[1437.86 → 1438.04] Okay.
[1438.42 → 1439.16] This is great.
[1439.24 → 1441.34] This is posted by WKD Paul on the forum.
[1441.88 → 1443.70] And if you guys aren't familiar with Stadia.
[1443.84 → 1444.00] I'm out.
[1444.34 → 1446.22] It's basically...
[1446.22 → 1449.38] What was that stupid thing that was the first one that didn't work?
[1449.46 → 1449.96] Now I forget.
[1450.22 → 1450.54] Dang it.
[1450.54 → 1451.34] The...
[1451.34 → 1452.46] The first one.
[1452.66 → 1452.98] The NVIDIA one?
[1453.08 → 1453.54] No, no.
[1453.60 → 1454.12] Before that.
[1454.66 → 1455.66] The first gaming stream...
[1455.66 → 1456.44] Game streaming thing.
[1456.52 → 1459.04] It was that, like, arm-based one.
[1459.20 → 1459.68] Yeah.
[1459.68 → 1460.68] Uh...
[1460.68 → 1461.76] Dang it.
[1462.48 → 1463.14] Cloud gaming.
[1463.24 → 1464.80] I don't think anyone cared, though.
[1464.88 → 1466.90] I know, but I'm trying to...
[1466.90 → 1468.48] Cloud gaming first one.
[1468.92 → 1469.72] First one?
[1470.48 → 1471.22] Shut up.
[1471.28 → 1472.04] This is my...
[1472.04 → 1473.66] Be nice to me.
[1474.66 → 1475.66] Had a rough week.
[1475.72 → 1477.08] I just love that.
[1477.34 → 1478.24] On live!
[1478.64 → 1479.76] Oh, you found it, actually.
[1479.84 → 1480.06] Okay.
[1480.42 → 1482.56] Hey, my Google foo is strong.
[1482.64 → 1483.20] I was...
[1483.20 → 1483.88] I'm impressed.
[1484.20 → 1484.52] I'm impressed.
[1484.68 → 1485.88] To be fair, it just came up with Wikipedia.
[1486.24 → 1487.32] Google was like, I don't know.
[1487.70 → 1488.22] Take this.
[1488.44 → 1488.66] Look.
[1489.30 → 1490.80] Was it the second hit or not?
[1491.02 → 1491.62] It was.
[1491.90 → 1493.74] But that's because of cloud gaming, not first one.
[1494.42 → 1494.86] Whatever.
[1495.52 → 1496.34] You know what?
[1496.80 → 1497.98] Control F first.
[1498.12 → 1498.70] Is it in here?
[1498.84 → 1499.36] There you go.
[1499.44 → 1499.68] Boom.
[1499.78 → 1500.10] First.
[1500.10 → 1501.10] Don't worry about it.
[1502.94 → 1503.46] Okay.
[1503.98 → 1504.90] One didn't help you that much.
[1505.66 → 1506.24] So, on live.
[1506.76 → 1509.10] Basically, the idea is that you've got this...
[1509.10 → 1512.02] this lightweight, inexpensive box,
[1512.18 → 1513.66] and then you've got a server somewhere
[1513.66 → 1515.02] that actually renders the game,
[1515.36 → 1517.58] and your commands are sent over the internet,
[1517.88 → 1520.40] and then the actual rendered game frames
[1520.40 → 1523.08] are sent over the internet to that box that decodes them.
[1523.16 → 1525.76] It's an H.264, or ideally H.265,
[1525.80 → 1527.82] or something more sophisticated video stream
[1527.82 → 1528.68] that goes on your screen.
[1529.12 → 1531.24] So, you don't actually have to buy a console
[1531.24 → 1535.16] or gaming PC in order to have a high-fidelity gaming experience,
[1535.54 → 1537.18] and what you give up for that
[1537.18 → 1539.30] is that you don't actually own your hardware or your games,
[1539.40 → 1540.70] and you have to pay a monthly subscription.
[1540.92 → 1542.02] So, it's gaming as a service.
[1543.06 → 1546.74] In a nutshell, Google Stadia is Google's entrant
[1546.74 → 1550.10] into what is becoming rapidly a very crowded field,
[1550.10 → 1554.58] and in order to make their platform lower latency,
[1554.74 → 1557.28] because the hardcore gamers have said,
[1557.86 → 1560.64] look, this can never be as good as local,
[1560.64 → 1562.60] because laws of physics,
[1563.16 → 1566.50] no matter, even if we're communicating at the speed of light,
[1566.58 → 1569.24] which we literally are if you have fibre optic internet,
[1569.72 → 1572.50] and it goes all the way to the server over fibre optics,
[1572.62 → 1573.42] literally speed of light,
[1573.58 → 1576.60] we're still talking like 50 milliseconds,
[1577.44 → 1579.86] ideally, to a server that's like,
[1580.06 → 1581.52] not down the street from you,
[1581.64 → 1584.70] and that assumes that you're not going unnecessarily
[1584.70 → 1585.92] through a bunch of different hops,
[1585.96 → 1588.28] which can happen depending on congestion or outages
[1588.28 → 1590.54] or DDoS attacks, or whatever the case may be.
[1591.86 → 1593.34] So, this is Google's solution.
[1593.92 → 1594.70] I love this.
[1595.54 → 1598.50] AI that predicts when you're going to do something,
[1600.00 → 1603.94] adding a negative latency offset to your gaming.
[1604.22 → 1604.46] Go.
[1608.46 → 1610.52] There's just so many things that are so deep with this,
[1610.74 → 1612.84] because the amount of time it's going to happen
[1612.84 → 1615.44] where it's going to interpret the wrong thing.
[1615.64 → 1616.70] One of the things I hated the most,
[1616.70 → 1620.60] the reason why I beat the little girl on stage in Mario Kart
[1620.60 → 1622.06] was because...
[1622.06 → 1622.72] You're a monster.
[1622.90 → 1623.92] You're still a monster.
[1623.92 → 1625.54] I didn't know the new Switch version...
[1625.54 → 1626.36] How old was she?
[1626.70 → 1627.30] Like 10?
[1627.30 → 1627.68] Very young.
[1628.22 → 1628.52] Eight?
[1628.70 → 1630.44] I didn't know the new Switch version
[1630.44 → 1632.02] had a training wheels feature
[1632.02 → 1634.92] where it would keep you on the course.
[1635.12 → 1636.40] I knew it felt weird,
[1636.76 → 1637.66] but I was like, whatever.
[1638.64 → 1640.54] But my whole goal,
[1640.66 → 1641.58] it's a long story,
[1641.68 → 1642.86] but my whole goal was I wanted to stop
[1642.86 → 1643.66] before the finish line.
[1643.66 → 1646.78] And then the training wheels drove me over the finish line.
[1646.86 → 1649.46] I was trying to force my car into the wall
[1649.46 → 1650.68] and say, leave me alone!
[1650.84 → 1651.58] I didn't want to!
[1653.36 → 1655.56] But that feature sucks,
[1655.64 → 1657.22] and I know it's not the exact same thing,
[1657.42 → 1658.00] but in this one,
[1658.24 → 1660.70] is it going to learn
[1660.70 → 1663.36] that I'm not very good at shooting people in the head?
[1663.68 → 1665.38] And when I try to shoot them in the head,
[1665.62 → 1668.64] is it going to make me shoot them in the chest?
[1669.10 → 1670.10] Like, what?
[1670.64 → 1671.84] If I go, and I'm like,
[1671.96 → 1672.30] you know what?
[1672.44 → 1673.58] This time I'm going to do it.
[1673.72 → 1674.52] I'm going to aim
[1674.52 → 1676.24] and make sure I actually aim properly.
[1676.24 → 1677.48] This time I'm going to aim!
[1677.50 → 1680.18] And I go, and I sweep up on my mouse pad,
[1680.38 → 1681.22] going for his head,
[1681.28 → 1681.82] and Nadia's like,
[1681.96 → 1685.20] nope, I'm going to keep your cursor here.
[1685.28 → 1686.02] This is a great quote.
[1686.10 → 1686.72] This is a great quote.
[1687.26 → 1687.58] Ultimately,
[1688.22 → 1690.56] we think that in a year or two,
[1690.66 → 1692.60] we'll have games that are running faster
[1692.60 → 1695.04] and feel more responsive in the cloud
[1695.04 → 1696.16] than they do locally,
[1696.16 → 1698.84] regardless of how powerful the local machine is.
[1702.66 → 1703.90] So basically,
[1703.90 → 1706.28] it's like a buffer of predicted latency
[1706.28 → 1708.74] inherent to Stadia player's setup or connection
[1708.74 → 1711.10] in which the Stadia system will run leg mitigation.
[1711.38 → 1712.54] Like, could they maybe
[1712.54 → 1715.80] do computation for like
[1715.80 → 1718.24] a huge variety of possible outcomes
[1718.24 → 1720.16] so that they're ready if you do them?
[1720.34 → 1722.08] But it wouldn't know which ones...
[1722.08 → 1723.06] Oh, I guess it could.
[1724.30 → 1725.26] Okay, that would be pretty cool.
[1725.26 → 1726.78] So maybe it's not just one.
[1727.92 → 1731.50] Because if it sent you like...
[1731.50 → 1732.44] Okay, now hold on.
[1732.50 → 1734.34] This would be like a new codec even.
[1734.68 → 1735.52] This would be nuts.
[1735.66 → 1737.78] What if it sent you like
[1737.78 → 1741.76] 10 or 20 or 50 different outcomes
[1741.76 → 1744.34] and then like assuming that your shot
[1744.34 → 1745.38] was either on target
[1745.38 → 1748.54] or like slightly anywhere around it,
[1748.96 → 1751.74] if it could then like shift
[1751.74 → 1753.74] certain elements of the image,
[1753.74 → 1757.10] use AI to fill in the gaps,
[1757.98 → 1759.92] okay, maybe it's cool.
[1761.38 → 1762.32] Is it that?
[1762.48 → 1763.26] Well, no, I don't...
[1763.26 → 1764.10] They didn't say that.
[1764.16 → 1764.60] Not yet.
[1767.10 → 1768.20] Yeah, I don't know.
[1768.48 → 1770.68] The first interpretation that I have had of it,
[1770.78 → 1771.36] I hate it.
[1771.36 → 1774.60] If they try to like to give you like a...
[1774.60 → 1780.44] Schrödinger's cat of potential future gaming solutions,
[1780.82 → 1782.34] that could be pretty interesting.
[1783.20 → 1783.64] All right.
[1783.82 → 1785.22] Did he kill or did he not kill?
[1785.38 → 1788.44] Well, both options are true until proven false.
[1788.80 → 1790.60] So I don't have...
[1790.60 → 1793.48] I don't desire to continue streaming today.
[1793.48 → 1793.70] No.
[1794.04 → 1794.84] I think we're...
[1794.84 → 1798.24] I want to go home.
[1798.24 → 1799.54] So far today,
[1799.64 → 1800.80] I've been pro-genocide,
[1801.24 → 1801.84] pro-China,
[1802.52 → 1803.56] pro-fascism.
[1806.96 → 1807.44] Yeah.
[1807.56 → 1808.84] Yeah, I don't even know what else.
[1809.38 → 1810.06] You know what?
[1810.30 → 1811.38] You do you, buddy.
[1812.08 → 1813.44] Thanks for watching, guys.
[1813.80 → 1814.84] See you again next week.
[1814.94 → 1815.70] Same bat time,
[1815.82 → 1816.60] same bat channel.
[1816.82 → 1817.10] Bye.
[1819.02 → 1820.12] Oh, crap.
[1820.34 → 1821.10] Super chats.
[1821.14 → 1822.78] I should probably do some super chats.
[1822.86 → 1823.14] Okay.
[1823.50 → 1823.78] Okay.
[1824.30 → 1825.08] 32 bytes says,
[1825.14 → 1826.18] your stream was down for eight minutes.
[1826.22 → 1826.62] What happened?
[1826.68 → 1828.16] We actually have no idea.
[1828.16 → 1828.42] We don't know.
[1828.66 → 1830.96] That'll be some post-mortem diagnosis there.
[1833.02 → 1833.88] You know what?
[1833.96 → 1834.24] Fine.
[1834.42 → 1835.00] Alfie says,
[1835.18 → 1837.42] where do you all stand on pro-China-free Hong Kong?
[1837.42 → 1840.58] We stand pre-Hong Kong.
[1840.80 → 1841.64] Free Hong Kong.
[1841.90 → 1843.54] We noted that at the beginning of the stream.
[1843.66 → 1844.24] Yeah, we did.
[1844.32 → 1844.54] We did.
[1844.58 → 1845.06] That happened.
[1845.16 → 1845.78] Not this stream.
[1845.92 → 1846.32] The other one.
[1846.46 → 1847.02] That's true.
[1847.16 → 1848.18] This is kind of the part two streams.
[1848.22 → 1848.66] That's true.
[1850.26 → 1850.88] Santa says,
[1850.96 → 1851.98] no one wants you to be political,
[1852.16 → 1852.88] just ethical.
[1855.08 → 1855.48] Yeah.
[1855.92 → 1856.68] It's amazing.
[1856.96 → 1858.50] But somehow that has become political,
[1858.62 → 1858.94] hasn't it?
[1858.94 → 1859.12] Yeah.
[1859.94 → 1860.86] It's kind of amazing.
[1861.28 → 1862.56] And that was where the whole
[1862.56 → 1864.56] lawful evil discussion came in.
[1864.64 → 1865.54] That was again on part one.
[1865.54 → 1867.00] We really tried to cover
[1867.00 → 1867.50] basis.
[1867.98 → 1869.40] It just didn't work.
[1871.40 → 1872.54] Gap2Franny says,
[1872.66 → 1874.12] I ordered the LTT edition
[1874.12 → 1875.76] Noctua heat sink.
[1876.20 → 1877.18] One of the decals will go
[1877.18 → 1878.54] on the two and a half inch quad box
[1878.54 → 1879.74] that you signed at LTX 2019,
[1879.90 → 1880.46] which I appreciate.
[1880.58 → 1881.42] Gold looks great on blue.
[1881.52 → 1882.24] Oh, I'm so glad.
[1884.44 → 1885.40] Oh my goodness.
[1885.54 → 1885.74] Wow.
[1885.82 → 1885.96] Yeah.
[1885.96 → 1887.44] This is just all about this.
[1887.82 → 1888.32] Oh man.
[1888.44 → 1889.22] Classed 413.
[1889.38 → 1890.50] It's not fair to a company
[1890.50 → 1891.92] that you're a face for
[1891.92 → 1893.14] to espouse controversial topics
[1893.14 → 1893.84] that could cost people
[1893.84 → 1894.70] their livelihoods.
[1894.70 → 1896.14] I'm actually not sure
[1896.14 → 1897.22] what your position is here.
[1897.26 → 1897.74] And you know what?
[1897.80 → 1898.60] I'm okay with that.
[1898.74 → 1899.80] No, I think he's specifically
[1899.80 → 1901.10] talking about when you
[1901.10 → 1902.00] were talking about
[1902.00 → 1902.82] people's Twitters
[1902.82 → 1903.40] at the company.
[1904.20 → 1904.64] Oh.
[1905.70 → 1906.08] Yeah.
[1906.24 → 1906.62] Okay.
[1906.92 → 1907.22] Sure.
[1908.10 → 1909.02] Blink your eyes 1400.
[1909.30 → 1909.80] I'm putting together
[1909.80 → 1910.44] a gaming PC.
[1910.56 → 1910.80] Want to know
[1910.80 → 1911.28] what is the best
[1911.28 → 1912.52] Wi-Fi card for it?
[1913.88 → 1914.90] Uh, Ethernet connection.
[1914.90 → 1915.30] Power line.
[1915.30 → 1916.12] Yeah.
[1916.20 → 1917.06] And if not that,
[1917.16 → 1917.80] then Power line.
[1917.88 → 1918.66] Power line is better
[1918.66 → 1919.58] than Wi-Fi.
[1920.02 → 1921.62] If you must have Wi-Fi,
[1921.80 → 1923.30] then it really is more
[1923.30 → 1924.16] to do with like
[1924.16 → 1925.12] how close you can get
[1925.12 → 1925.94] the antennas together
[1925.94 → 1926.84] and less to do with
[1926.84 → 1927.44] like how great
[1927.44 → 1928.42] your Wi-Fi card is.
[1929.40 → 1932.42] Um, 225 Perfect says,
[1932.94 → 1933.90] reasoned and balanced
[1933.90 → 1934.84] commentary will never
[1934.84 → 1935.78] appease the zealots.
[1936.18 → 1937.26] I'm pro Hong Kong.
[1937.34 → 1938.30] I get what you're saying
[1938.30 → 1939.16] and I'm sure many others
[1939.16 → 1939.72] do too,
[1939.84 → 1940.96] but the squeakiest wheel
[1940.96 → 1941.60] gets the grease,
[1941.68 → 1942.18] so to speak.
[1942.68 → 1943.14] Thank you.
[1943.22 → 1943.86] That was actually
[1943.86 → 1944.82] really nice to hear.
[1944.98 → 1945.16] Oh.
[1945.84 → 1946.92] Someone gets it.
[1946.92 → 1949.48] Alexis says,
[1949.80 → 1951.20] Alexis sends $5.
[1952.12 → 1952.98] Long time listener,
[1953.12 → 1953.80] first time chatter,
[1953.90 → 1954.52] love the podcast.
[1954.86 → 1957.10] Here's $2.75 of my money.
[1957.60 → 1958.64] Alexis gets it.
[1959.44 → 1960.56] Uh, Ilya says,
[1960.64 → 1961.30] have you seen
[1961.30 → 1962.42] Debater's video series
[1962.42 → 1962.96] where he examines
[1962.96 → 1964.14] 9900K under the
[1964.14 → 1964.86] electron microscope
[1964.86 → 1965.82] to a single transistor
[1965.82 → 1966.14] visible?
[1966.28 → 1966.78] No, I haven't.
[1966.84 → 1967.28] Sounds cool.
[1968.16 → 1970.44] Um, Drunken Gerard says,
[1970.48 → 1970.88] it's going to be
[1970.88 → 1971.98] the best Blazon ever.
[1972.58 → 1973.30] I'm going.
[1973.70 → 1974.48] Are you really?
[1974.50 → 1975.26] I've had a ticket
[1975.26 → 1978.46] for like a really long time.
[1978.94 → 1980.42] It's going to be really weird.
[1980.54 → 1981.02] Oh boy.
[1981.10 → 1982.12] I've been planning so far.
[1982.14 → 1982.42] I'll tell you
[1982.42 → 1983.30] what I've been planning so far.
[1983.50 → 1984.48] Do you know Red Shirt Guy?
[1984.62 → 1985.16] Do you know the history
[1985.16 → 1985.88] of Red Shirt Guy?
[1986.82 → 1987.88] Sounds familiar.
[1988.22 → 1988.52] There is always some,
[1988.98 → 1990.38] somebody goes up to the mic
[1990.38 → 1991.02] at Blazon.
[1991.10 → 1991.28] Yeah.
[1991.44 → 1993.08] And it was the same guy
[1993.08 → 1993.76] for a long time
[1993.76 → 1994.56] and then around Blizzard
[1994.56 → 1995.96] or Diablo Immortals
[1995.96 → 1996.82] it was a new guy.
[1996.96 → 1997.14] Yeah.
[1997.20 → 1998.18] He just also happened
[1998.18 → 1999.18] to be wearing a red shirt.
[1999.52 → 2000.54] But they just say things
[2000.54 → 2001.48] that just dunk Blizzard
[2001.48 → 2001.92] every time.
[2002.18 → 2003.30] So I am packing
[2003.30 → 2007.14] specifically only red shirts
[2007.14 → 2010.40] just as like a joke
[2010.40 → 2011.40] and I was already
[2011.40 → 2012.28] planning on doing that
[2012.28 → 2013.02] and now I'm just like
[2013.02 → 2013.78] whoa.
[2015.78 → 2016.80] That was going to be crazy.
[2016.88 → 2017.92] I'm going to go anyway.
[2018.08 → 2019.12] I mean, do we start
[2019.12 → 2021.40] like the Red Sea movement here?
[2021.58 → 2022.42] And just get everyone
[2022.42 → 2024.08] at Blazon to wear red shirts?
[2024.14 → 2024.82] Sea of red.
[2025.24 → 2026.00] Oh my God.
[2026.00 → 2026.62] I don't think we,
[2026.68 → 2027.40] I don't think we have
[2027.40 → 2028.32] the clout to do it.
[2028.62 → 2028.84] No.
[2028.88 → 2029.38] But like.
[2029.50 → 2030.18] We could try.
[2030.18 → 2031.12] It would be amazing.
[2031.12 → 2032.76] I mean, our audience might.
[2032.94 → 2034.60] There's 10,000 people
[2034.60 → 2035.44] watching right now.
[2035.48 → 2035.66] Yeah.
[2036.18 → 2036.48] Like.
[2036.60 → 2037.48] I will be at Blazon.
[2037.56 → 2038.66] If every one of you
[2038.66 → 2039.72] tells 10 people
[2039.72 → 2041.68] that would be 100,000 people
[2041.68 → 2042.88] who are at least aware
[2042.88 → 2043.54] of this,
[2043.96 → 2045.06] of the idea
[2045.06 → 2046.74] of showing up at Blazon
[2046.74 → 2048.04] wearing a red shirt.
[2048.22 → 2048.54] Do it.
[2048.64 → 2050.32] It would be hilarious.
[2050.58 → 2051.36] If you show up
[2051.36 → 2051.96] to Blazon
[2051.96 → 2052.64] and you see me
[2052.64 → 2053.38] and you're not wearing
[2053.38 → 2053.86] a red shirt,
[2054.14 → 2054.78] no selfie.
[2055.06 → 2055.78] Or if you come up to me
[2055.78 → 2056.36] and you see me
[2056.36 → 2056.76] and you're not wearing
[2056.76 → 2057.08] a red shirt
[2057.08 → 2057.38] and you're like
[2057.38 → 2058.50] I can't afford to buy red shirts.
[2058.50 → 2059.24] If you're going to threaten that,
[2059.24 → 2062.28] you have to hold true to it.
[2062.38 → 2062.54] Okay.
[2062.60 → 2063.16] But what do we do
[2063.16 → 2063.60] for the people
[2063.60 → 2064.04] that are like.
[2064.12 → 2065.40] You carry one extra red shirt
[2065.40 → 2066.54] in like quadruple XL.
[2067.32 → 2068.20] I'll cover it.
[2068.26 → 2069.24] And just put it on
[2069.24 → 2070.30] and then take it off
[2070.30 → 2071.12] when they've done the selfie?
[2071.22 → 2071.80] Expense it to
[2071.80 → 2072.40] Linus Media Group
[2072.40 → 2072.74] or something.
[2072.88 → 2073.82] I will pay for
[2073.82 → 2075.22] a 4XL red shirt.
[2075.36 → 2075.58] Okay.
[2075.84 → 2076.68] I expect to see
[2076.68 → 2077.40] zero selfies
[2077.40 → 2078.54] with Luke from Blazon
[2078.54 → 2079.76] if they are not
[2079.76 → 2080.96] adorned in red.
[2081.08 → 2081.74] Because they might be
[2081.74 → 2082.36] someone who like
[2082.36 → 2083.26] takes it far away.
[2083.60 → 2084.10] But no like.
[2084.10 → 2084.60] You chase them down,
[2084.68 → 2085.34] you take their phone.
[2085.34 → 2089.46] All right.
[2089.58 → 2090.10] Red shirts,
[2090.22 → 2090.58] Blazon,
[2090.70 → 2090.92] do it up.
[2090.92 → 2091.42] Jack Death.
[2092.30 → 2093.46] Exactly how much damage
[2093.46 → 2095.14] does the depth of discharge
[2095.14 → 2096.10] do to a phone battery
[2096.10 → 2097.34] compared to the height of charge?
[2097.44 → 2097.96] The video you made
[2097.96 → 2098.40] wasn't clear.
[2098.48 → 2099.20] They're both bad.
[2099.30 → 2100.18] Depth of discharge
[2100.18 → 2101.12] is going to like
[2101.12 → 2102.02] instantly kill it
[2102.02 → 2103.00] if you go too deep.
[2103.08 → 2103.76] But most phones
[2103.76 → 2104.44] should prevent you
[2104.44 → 2105.16] from doing that.
[2105.82 → 2107.06] Whereas height of charge
[2107.06 → 2107.70] is more like
[2107.70 → 2108.84] a slow burn.
[2110.60 → 2111.70] Lego lad play well.
[2111.70 → 2112.36] It's notable
[2112.36 → 2113.46] that an American team
[2113.46 → 2114.40] did a very similar thing
[2114.40 → 2115.14] as Blitz Chung
[2115.14 → 2115.70] soon after
[2115.70 → 2117.06] and faced no repercussions
[2117.06 → 2117.96] at all.
[2119.34 → 2119.70] No.
[2120.18 → 2120.70] Are you talking
[2120.70 → 2121.24] about the NBA?
[2121.92 → 2122.64] Because that's been
[2122.64 → 2124.06] a huge controversy.
[2124.18 → 2125.08] I forget which team it was.
[2125.20 → 2125.50] I don't follow the NBA.
[2125.50 → 2125.98] I think he's talking
[2125.98 → 2126.42] about Hearthstone
[2126.42 → 2127.10] but I know nothing
[2127.10 → 2127.60] about this.
[2128.14 → 2129.02] Oh, an American
[2129.02 → 2130.08] Hearthstone team
[2130.08 → 2131.64] faced no repercussions
[2131.64 → 2132.12] at all.
[2132.26 → 2132.94] Yeah, that doesn't
[2132.94 → 2133.80] sound that surprising to me.
[2133.80 → 2134.32] This is what
[2134.32 → 2135.22] I said early on.
[2135.30 → 2135.82] I don't know everything
[2135.82 → 2136.30] about the story.
[2136.38 → 2136.98] Once again,
[2137.90 → 2139.24] Blizzard handled it wrong.
[2139.82 → 2141.16] Very, very bad.
[2141.16 → 2142.94] D minus.
[2146.00 → 2146.72] Jason says
[2146.72 → 2147.68] another major issue
[2147.68 → 2148.30] is how Tencent
[2148.30 → 2148.84] is involved
[2148.84 → 2149.38] in all the major
[2149.38 → 2149.96] gaming companies.
[2150.08 → 2150.78] So many.
[2150.84 → 2151.38] So Tim Sweeney
[2151.38 → 2152.28] came out and said
[2152.28 → 2153.14] well as long as
[2153.14 → 2153.68] I'm in charge
[2153.68 → 2154.62] Epic Games blah blah.
[2154.76 → 2155.18] Yeah, how long
[2155.18 → 2155.48] are you going to be
[2155.48 → 2156.08] in charge Tim?
[2156.26 → 2156.88] Like how many more
[2156.88 → 2157.46] hundreds of millions
[2157.46 → 2158.40] of dollars do you need?
[2158.46 → 2158.98] Are you really going
[2158.98 → 2159.44] to stick around
[2159.44 → 2160.04] that much longer?
[2160.24 → 2161.76] Also, furthermore,
[2162.16 → 2162.56] who was it?
[2162.64 → 2163.32] Riot Games
[2163.32 → 2165.20] has made some
[2165.20 → 2166.26] pretty negative headlines
[2166.26 → 2166.90] over this as well.
[2167.12 → 2167.52] Unfortunately,
[2167.72 → 2168.58] I haven't looked into
[2168.58 → 2169.72] what they've said so far
[2169.72 → 2170.72] so I can't really
[2170.72 → 2171.48] comment on it yet.
[2172.56 → 2173.48] Made a statement
[2173.48 → 2174.18] saying that
[2174.18 → 2175.36] their broadcasters
[2175.36 → 2176.10] and their people
[2176.10 → 2176.70] are not to
[2176.70 → 2177.80] they effectively said
[2177.80 → 2178.56] what you guys said
[2178.56 → 2179.32] Blizzard should have said.
[2179.36 → 2180.00] Oh, okay.
[2180.08 → 2180.48] Never mind.
[2180.60 → 2180.90] Okay.
[2181.00 → 2181.74] They basically said
[2181.74 → 2182.74] look, no political stuff
[2182.74 → 2183.62] in our broadcasts.
[2183.62 → 2184.36] Yeah, but they've said
[2184.36 → 2185.02] it ahead of time.
[2185.24 → 2185.38] Okay.
[2185.44 → 2185.58] Yeah.
[2186.86 → 2187.68] There was also
[2187.68 → 2188.16] some issue
[2188.16 → 2189.24] one of the teams
[2189.24 → 2190.16] in that tournament
[2190.16 → 2190.54] is called
[2190.54 → 2191.60] Hong Kong Attitude
[2191.60 → 2192.98] and casters
[2192.98 → 2193.58] were shortening
[2193.58 → 2194.46] it to AKA
[2194.46 → 2196.08] so they thought
[2196.08 → 2196.76] that was a directive
[2196.76 → 2197.36] from Riot
[2197.36 → 2198.04] but apparently
[2198.04 → 2198.56] it was not.
[2198.70 → 2198.88] Right.
[2199.02 → 2199.38] To be fair,
[2199.46 → 2200.20] that's just a really
[2200.20 → 2200.96] long name to say
[2200.96 → 2201.58] a billion times
[2201.58 → 2202.18] during a cast
[2202.18 → 2202.84] so I wouldn't
[2202.84 → 2203.54] be too surprised.
[2204.48 → 2205.58] Arabian says
[2205.58 → 2206.52] is float plane okay?
[2206.64 → 2207.42] Had a minor heart attack
[2207.42 → 2208.14] when the stream went down.
[2208.22 → 2208.94] We'll figure it out.
[2209.84 → 2210.52] Float plane overall
[2210.52 → 2211.14] is fine but
[2211.14 → 2211.62] the streaming...
[2211.62 → 2212.36] The videos were streaming
[2212.36 → 2213.20] people were still watching.
[2214.48 → 2214.96] Zelensky,
[2215.30 → 2216.12] where are all your clothes
[2216.12 → 2216.38] made?
[2216.56 → 2216.80] China.
[2217.10 → 2218.22] Actually, where was this?
[2218.82 → 2219.22] Honduras.
[2219.44 → 2219.88] Honduras.
[2219.88 → 2222.12] And printed in Canada
[2222.12 → 2222.70] by the way.
[2224.90 → 2225.44] Bam, bam, bam!
[2227.72 → 2228.88] Luke, what's your go-to
[2228.88 → 2229.54] from Tim Hortons
[2229.54 → 2230.40] asks Jonah?
[2231.48 → 2231.98] Hot chocolate.
[2232.16 → 2233.10] Tim Hortons kind of sucks.
[2233.20 → 2235.54] Tim Hortons sucks ass now.
[2235.80 → 2236.96] If I do go there
[2236.96 → 2238.22] it's a chili.
[2238.82 → 2239.66] Yeah, it's the only
[2239.66 → 2240.32] edible thing left
[2240.32 → 2240.72] on the menu
[2240.72 → 2241.88] and the bun sucks now.
[2242.02 → 2242.38] And chocolate.
[2242.50 → 2243.36] Yes, it does.
[2243.74 → 2244.76] And you're supposed...
[2244.76 → 2245.88] You take all the bread
[2245.88 → 2246.80] out of the bun
[2246.80 → 2247.64] and you kind of
[2247.64 → 2248.10] squish together
[2248.10 → 2248.92] and use that as a spoon
[2248.92 → 2249.44] and then you use
[2249.44 → 2250.16] the hollowed shell
[2250.16 → 2250.60] of the bun
[2250.60 → 2251.16] as a spoon.
[2251.34 → 2252.20] That's how you eat it.
[2252.20 → 2252.74] The old bun
[2252.74 → 2253.34] was like this
[2253.34 → 2254.90] delightfully chewy bun
[2254.90 → 2255.40] and then they went
[2255.40 → 2255.88] and they put this
[2255.88 → 2256.64] hard crust...
[2256.64 → 2257.48] So dry.
[2257.78 → 2259.54] Dry garbage bun.
[2259.56 → 2260.44] And the chili's worse
[2260.44 → 2261.10] now, I think.
[2261.32 → 2261.86] I don't...
[2261.86 → 2262.54] I don't want this...
[2262.54 → 2263.40] Look, look.
[2263.86 → 2264.50] I don't want this
[2264.50 → 2265.36] to come across
[2265.36 → 2267.18] anti-America
[2267.18 → 2269.04] or pro-fascism
[2269.04 → 2269.98] or whatever.
[2270.20 → 2270.36] Yeah.
[2270.58 → 2271.40] But ever since
[2271.40 → 2272.56] Tim Hortons got bought
[2272.56 → 2273.54] they suck.
[2274.46 → 2274.90] Downhill.
[2275.14 → 2275.74] They used to make
[2275.74 → 2277.04] the donuts fresh in store.
[2277.28 → 2278.10] Tim Hortons donuts
[2278.10 → 2279.32] are inedible now.
[2279.68 → 2280.38] They're disgusting.
[2281.26 → 2282.24] They used to be good.
[2282.44 → 2282.72] But yeah,
[2282.82 → 2283.62] so it would be
[2283.62 → 2286.10] chili and a chocolate milk.
[2286.16 → 2287.06] If I have to eat it
[2287.06 → 2287.58] Tim Hortons,
[2287.68 → 2288.54] I get the chili too.
[2288.92 → 2289.48] They're not owned
[2289.48 → 2290.34] by an American company,
[2290.44 → 2290.72] by the way.
[2290.82 → 2291.40] I thought they were
[2291.40 → 2291.82] owned by an American company.
[2291.82 → 2292.36] Yeah, it's not owned
[2292.36 → 2293.26] by like a Brazilian
[2293.26 → 2293.58] investment.
[2293.58 → 2294.78] Oh, Brazilian investment.
[2294.90 → 2295.50] Well, I don't want this
[2295.50 → 2296.06] to come across
[2296.06 → 2297.20] anti-Brazilian either.
[2297.40 → 2298.30] Whoever, whatever.
[2298.30 → 2298.86] Whoever's mad.
[2298.94 → 2299.74] It just sucks now.
[2299.94 → 2300.64] It sucks now.
[2300.82 → 2302.06] It's been terrible
[2302.06 → 2303.40] ever since they got bought out.
[2303.68 → 2304.20] Good input, Nick.
[2304.60 → 2305.14] Thanks, Nick.
[2305.48 → 2306.20] Glad you helped me out.
[2306.30 → 2307.14] Someone would have screamed
[2307.14 → 2307.74] at us for that.
[2307.74 → 2308.30] Let's piss off the right people.
[2308.30 → 2309.44] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2309.50 → 2310.34] Let's get the right information.
[2310.56 → 2310.96] Exactly.
[2312.08 → 2312.44] Perfect.
[2313.66 → 2314.18] Oh, man.
[2314.30 → 2315.04] Oh, my goodness.
[2315.22 → 2315.96] Ever since we started
[2315.96 → 2316.84] reading Super Chats,
[2316.92 → 2317.46] people have been
[2317.46 → 2318.22] hitting it pretty hard.
[2318.42 → 2318.88] We can't.
[2319.00 → 2319.58] We got to go.
[2319.68 → 2319.92] Yes.
[2319.98 → 2320.38] Bye, guys.
[2320.50 → 2320.76] Bye.
[2321.02 → 2321.82] Thanks for watching.
[2323.16 → 2323.56] Yeah.
[2325.02 → 2326.34] We'll see you next time.
[2326.34 → 2327.34] Bye.
[2327.34 → 2328.34] Bye.
[2328.34 → 2329.34] Bye.
[2329.34 → 2330.34] Bye.
[2330.34 → 2331.34] Bye.
[2331.34 → 2332.34] Bye.
[2332.34 → 2333.34] Bye.
[2333.34 → 2333.40] Bye.
[2333.40 → 2333.46] Bye.
[2333.46 → 2333.52] Bye.
[2333.52 → 2333.54] Bye.
[2333.54 → 2333.60] Bye.
[2333.60 → 2333.64] Bye.
[2333.64 → 2333.66] Bye.
[2333.66 → 2333.76] Bye.
[2333.76 → 2334.18] Bye.
[2334.18 → 2335.18] Bye.
