[0.00 → 1.00] Oh welcome!
[1.00 → 2.00] Hey!
[2.00 → 3.00] Who's that guy?
[3.00 → 4.00] And whose water bottle is this?
[4.00 → 5.00] Oh my gosh!
[5.00 → 6.00] Is this vodka?
[6.00 → 7.00] You should be using this one!
[7.00 → 8.00] Get out of here!
[8.00 → 10.00] Linus isn't here, we have to shill extra hard.
[10.00 → 11.00] We can't shill that fast.
[11.00 → 12.00] Ah, sorry guys.
[12.00 → 14.00] Guys, okay, let's get this.
[14.00 → 15.00] It's the WAN Show!
[15.00 → 16.00] I demand order.
[16.00 → 20.00] It's the WAN Show with only brunettes.
[20.00 → 21.00] This week.
[21.00 → 22.00] Are we?
[22.00 → 23.00] Yeah.
[23.00 → 24.00] So welcome.
[24.00 → 25.00] I'm kind of a sandy brunette.
[25.00 → 27.00] I'm a mousy blonde.
[27.00 → 28.00] Anyway.
[28.00 → 29.00] I don't think that's a thing.
[29.00 → 30.00] What are we gonna talk about, Riley?
[30.00 → 31.00] Let me tell ya.
[31.00 → 32.00] I mean, you did the script.
[32.00 → 34.00] You don't have the points up near the top of it.
[34.00 → 35.00] I don't have anything here.
[35.00 → 37.00] Let me tell ya.
[37.00 → 42.00] We're gonna talk about the Apple, the newest patent for Apple's forthcoming folding phone.
[42.00 → 45.00] Which is not announced, but seems all but assured.
[45.00 → 48.00] We're gonna talk about the Xbox Game Pass for PC.
[48.00 → 53.00] And DeepMind has added again with a new AI that can kick your butt at video games.
[53.00 → 57.00] This time in a first-person shooter that we all love, Quake 3 Arena.
[57.00 → 58.00] Yep.
[58.00 → 59.00] We're doomed.
[59.00 → 60.00] We're...
[60.00 → 61.00] Ah!
[61.00 → 62.00] Good one.
[62.00 → 63.00] Roll the intro.
[63.00 → 64.00] Roll that intro, dudes!
[64.00 → 65.00] It's not getting better than that.
[65.00 → 66.00] Boom!
[66.00 → 72.00] Well, um, you think the folding iPhone is assured?
[72.00 → 73.00] Hold on.
[73.00 → 75.00] The intro's rolling.
[75.00 → 76.00] Sponsors!
[76.00 → 77.00] Sponsors!
[77.00 → 79.00] Hey, Brian, can I close this?
[79.00 → 80.00] Oh.
[80.00 → 81.00] Okay, there it is.
[81.00 → 82.00] Oh.
[82.00 → 83.00] Uh...
[83.00 → 85.00] Save Jerky.
[85.00 → 86.00] Oh!
[86.00 → 87.00] This is...
[87.00 → 88.00] Uh-oh.
[88.00 → 89.00] Uh...
[89.00 → 90.00] Save Jerky....
[90.00 → 91.00] Ah!
[91.00 → 92.00] What?
[92.00 → 93.00] Click on the sponsor.
[93.00 → 94.00] I did it!
[94.00 → 95.00] Guys.
[95.00 → 96.00] Guys, this is not funny.
[96.00 → 97.00] Guys, this is not funny!
[97.00 → 98.00] Guys, yeah...
[98.00 → 99.00] Savage Jerky!
[99.00 → 100.00] Where is it?
[100.00 → 101.00] It's not there.
[101.00 → 103.00] Okay, abort, abort.
[103.00 → 104.50] Oh, I know what to do.
[104.50 → 105.50] Boom.
[105.50 → 107.18] Savage Jerky.
[107.18 → 108.18] Sorry guys.
[109.50 → 113.06] And private internet access.
[113.06 → 114.80] And where's one more?
[114.80 → 116.52] Squarespace.
[116.52 → 118.14] Okay, now get out of there.
[118.14 → 119.06] Get out of there.
[119.06 → 120.10] Get out of there.
[120.10 → 122.58] Ah, guys, I should have known.
[122.58 → 124.42] I should have known not to put me in this chair
[124.42 → 126.26] after what happened when I was with Luke.
[126.26 → 127.80] The most stressful part is over.
[127.80 → 128.78] Now we can just talk.
[128.78 → 130.12] I don't want to go in that order.
[130.12 → 132.00] Do you want to talk with the iPhone first?
[133.00 → 134.86] It's up to you, man.
[134.86 → 136.64] It's at the top.
[136.64 → 137.64] Okay, let's do it.
[137.64 → 141.04] Because I saw this story and I did not include it
[141.04 → 142.04] in Tech Link today.
[142.04 → 142.54] Okay.
[142.54 → 144.58] Because I thought it was like,
[144.58 → 146.72] who knows whether it's real,
[146.72 → 147.94] but you seem pretty confident.
[147.94 → 151.62] Well, only insofar as they have a pretty good pile
[151.62 → 153.62] of patents about foldable phones now.
[153.62 → 154.38] Mm-hmm.
[154.38 → 155.58] There are several patents out.
[155.58 → 158.10] And I'm aware that a lot of patents,
[158.10 → 160.40] and particularly a lot of Apple patents,
[160.40 → 162.16] do not become products.
[162.16 → 162.84] Yes.
[162.84 → 164.10] I'm aware of that.
[164.10 → 165.20] Well, as long as you're aware.
[165.20 → 166.08] I'm aware of that.
[166.08 → 169.78] But they've got a bunch, and it...
[169.78 → 171.92] I don't want to get into these questions quite yet.
[171.92 → 173.88] Let's just talk about the latest patent first, okay?
[173.88 → 175.98] Okay, what does the latest patent describe?
[175.98 → 180.22] It describes a device that has multiple folds.
[180.22 → 181.30] Like a wallet.
[181.30 → 181.86] Mm.
[181.86 → 182.36] Can you...
[182.36 → 183.76] You're going to get that photo up for everybody?
[183.76 → 184.96] I'm getting it up right now.
[184.96 → 186.30] Oh, that sounded weird in retrospect.
[186.30 → 187.24] How you...
[187.24 → 188.24] How you...
[188.24 → 189.74] Are you going to use that Plato thing?
[189.74 → 190.24] Boom!
[190.24 → 190.74] Nice!
[190.74 → 191.24] Look at that!
[191.24 → 192.08] All right.
[192.08 → 192.68] You got to test it.
[192.68 → 193.24] I know how to do things.
[193.24 → 195.24] There's a little diagram here.
[195.24 → 195.98] Keep going.
[195.98 → 197.34] Let's go down to the diagram.
[197.34 → 198.34] Keep going.
[198.34 → 199.34] This is a render.
[199.34 → 200.34] It's going to be slower.
[200.34 → 201.34] Holy crap.
[201.34 → 202.34] Stop.
[202.34 → 203.34] I don't want notifications.
[203.34 → 204.34] There we go.
[204.34 → 205.34] Boom.
[205.34 → 206.34] So the one on the...
[206.34 → 208.34] Well, you can see the bottom, the cross-section kind of thing.
[208.34 → 209.34] A fold that phones...
[209.34 → 211.34] A phone that folds twice.
[211.34 → 216.34] And I guess the point here is you may not want a crease, which seems kind of inevitable.
[216.34 → 217.34] Mm.
[217.34 → 220.34] A perceptible crease in the middle of your OLED screen.
[220.34 → 223.34] You might not want that in the middle of your OLED screen.
[223.34 → 228.34] You might want two that are kind of nearer to the edges.
[228.34 → 232.34] You might want a third away from the edge that is less perceptible, even though there's
[232.34 → 233.34] two of them.
[233.34 → 234.34] What do you think?
[234.34 → 241.34] Well, I don't understand how this is going to be any better than some of the other folding
[241.34 → 243.34] phones we've seen so far.
[243.34 → 248.34] I mean, like, I don't really feel super confident in any folding phone design until we see another
[248.34 → 249.34] one come out.
[249.34 → 254.34] Because the only one that we've seen come out is the Galaxy Fold, and it was a complete
[254.34 → 255.34] disaster.
[255.34 → 256.34] Yeah.
[256.34 → 262.34] Like, it's hard for me to get excited about this because, like, yes, it seems more efficient.
[262.34 → 266.34] Why is it that you can't use your imagination and make a determination?
[266.34 → 268.34] I'm just not very imaginative.
[268.34 → 270.34] No, I don't mean to be like that.
[270.34 → 274.34] What I'm really asking you are, what do you think are the questions that can't be answered?
[274.34 → 280.34] Like, maybe one question is, is it going to get scratched if it folds such that the screen's
[280.34 → 281.34] on the outside?
[281.34 → 283.34] Or, you know?
[283.34 → 284.34] Okay, wait.
[284.34 → 287.34] Let's look at that one more time because I'm kind of confused looking at it.
[287.34 → 288.34] So what's the outside?
[288.34 → 290.34] This is the screen right here?
[290.34 → 291.34] I would think, can you use your mouse?
[291.34 → 292.34] Yep.
[292.34 → 293.34] This?
[293.34 → 294.34] Is that the screen?
[294.34 → 295.34] That would be fully open.
[295.34 → 296.34] And this is the outside?
[296.34 → 297.34] That would be the outside.
[297.34 → 298.34] Wait, but this is different.
[298.34 → 299.34] This is a different design.
[299.34 → 300.34] What's going on here?
[300.34 → 302.34] I don't even know what figure one really is.
[302.34 → 306.34] I'm looking at 4A, figure 4A, I think.
[306.34 → 309.34] It jumps from figure 1A to 1B to 4A.
[309.34 → 313.34] Well, we're looking at an article, not an actual patent document, so.
[313.34 → 319.34] But if we look at the bottom diagram, I think that the screen would be inside there to
[319.34 → 322.34] the top side of my magnifying glass right now.
[322.34 → 323.34] That would be screened.
[323.34 → 326.34] The bottom side of my magnifying glass would be outside.
[326.34 → 329.34] Going on the inside of this curve would be screened.
[329.34 → 330.34] Now that's a huge problem.
[330.34 → 333.34] Like, how are they going to do this?
[333.34 → 337.34] Is there going to be like to felt on this part of the phone so that the screen doesn't get
[337.34 → 338.34] scratched when it comes in contact?
[338.34 → 339.34] Could it be glass?
[339.34 → 340.34] Could it just be glass on glass?
[340.34 → 341.34] Glass on glass?
[341.34 → 343.34] Would that be okay?
[343.34 → 344.34] I don't know.
[344.34 → 346.34] That sounds dangerous.
[346.34 → 350.34] You know what the problem is, is that if you get debris in there, and then you fold the
[350.34 → 352.34] glass onto the glass.
[352.34 → 353.34] That's bad.
[353.34 → 354.34] That's not good.
[354.34 → 355.34] That's bad.
[355.34 → 361.34] The biggest problem I have with these things is, do I necessarily want, like, matter is
[361.34 → 363.34] never created or destroyed, okay?
[363.34 → 364.34] It's just folded in this case.
[364.34 → 369.34] Am I convinced that I want the dimensions to be different from this?
[369.34 → 370.34] This fits into a pocket, okay?
[370.34 → 371.34] This is a Pixel 3.
[371.34 → 372.34] This is a Pixel 3.
[372.34 → 374.34] It's pretty much the smallest phone you can get anymore.
[374.34 → 379.34] And it still fits in most front pockets of most men's pants that I wear.
[379.34 → 382.34] It's actually still a little too tall for jeans that I have.
[382.34 → 384.34] Like, sitting down in jeans with these sucks.
[384.34 → 391.34] So, do I want it to be half as long, but then twice or three times as thick in this case?
[391.34 → 392.34] No, I don't.
[392.34 → 396.34] And this is what's so weird about the whole folding phone trend, is that for years, phones
[396.34 → 400.34] have been getting thinner and thinner and thinner and like, companies are boasting about,
[400.34 → 402.34] we made the thinnest phone.
[402.34 → 405.34] And now, all of a sudden, they want to make folding phones and everyone, like, they assume
[405.34 → 410.34] that people are going to be fine with having like a chunky, chunky boy in their pocket.
[410.34 → 412.34] And I don't want that.
[412.34 → 413.34] Does anyone want that?
[413.34 → 415.34] This is what I'm trying to figure out.
[415.34 → 419.34] Because either, they take a phone that's this size when it's unfolded, and they just
[419.34 → 424.34] make it shorter and fatter when it is folded, or they make a phone that's maybe this big
[424.34 → 428.34] but thicker when folded, but when unfolded is really huge.
[428.34 → 430.34] And I don't want that either.
[430.34 → 434.34] I don't need a phone that, like the Galaxy Fold is probably too big.
[434.34 → 436.34] I don't want to hold a Sega Game Gear.
[436.34 → 442.34] See, the Galaxy Fold I found interesting because it was thick, but it wasn't so thick.
[442.34 → 449.34] I couldn't conceive of having that in my pants pocket or in like, you know, the demo guys
[449.34 → 451.34] kept putting it into their...
[451.34 → 452.34] That's a stretch.
[452.34 → 453.34] Their jacket pockets.
[453.34 → 454.34] I don't know.
[454.34 → 455.34] A jacket pocket?
[455.34 → 456.34] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[456.34 → 457.34] A breast pocket on a button-up shirt?
[457.34 → 458.34] No, no, no, no.
[458.34 → 459.34] I can't even put this in there without it being heavy.
[459.34 → 460.34] You can't put anything in there.
[460.34 → 462.34] Come on, a pencil at best, guys.
[462.34 → 467.34] Um, but this is what's so interesting with the whole Huawei thing because Huawei actually
[467.34 → 469.34] had a perfect design for their phone.
[469.34 → 475.34] Like, I liked their design way better than the Galaxy Fold where it folded, it was almost
[475.34 → 477.34] as thin as, you know, any random smartphone you pick up.
[477.34 → 481.34] Or as thin as a smartphone with a case on it.
[481.34 → 482.34] Yeah.
[482.34 → 484.34] Because it ends up being thicker anyway.
[484.34 → 486.34] So, I don't know.
[486.34 → 487.34] I mean, so what...
[487.34 → 489.34] Has there been any information about this particular pack?
[489.34 → 490.34] Okay, hold on.
[490.34 → 491.34] There's one other thing I want to talk about design-wise.
[491.34 → 492.34] Go for it.
[492.34 → 493.34] Go back to the picture for us.
[493.34 → 494.34] Yes, sir.
[494.34 → 499.34] Another thing that annoys me is these really gradual curves, like on the...
[499.34 → 503.34] I think on the Huawei design as well, on all of them, they're not like hinges that close
[503.34 → 507.34] and seal completely like this, such that the sides are completely adjacent to each other
[507.34 → 508.34] and abutting.
[508.34 → 509.34] They're...
[509.34 → 510.34] They're kind of wedged.
[510.34 → 513.34] Because the screen can't fold at such an extreme angle.
[513.34 → 515.34] It has to gently fold, right?
[515.34 → 516.34] Can't crease.
[516.34 → 517.34] Yeah.
[517.34 → 518.34] So you end up getting this wedge kind of...
[518.34 → 519.34] He...
[519.34 → 520.34] Lloyd, I...
[520.34 → 521.34] He's wearing the shirt.
[521.34 → 522.34] We don't have to both wear the shirt.
[522.34 → 523.34] Lloyd's holding up a shirt.
[523.34 → 524.34] He's disappointed.
[524.34 → 525.34] Lloyd really wants us to wear these shirts.
[525.34 → 527.34] He's like, I gave you this shirt to wear.
[527.34 → 528.34] Why are you wearing it?
[528.34 → 530.34] Lloyd, I'm representing two of your babies here.
[530.34 → 531.34] We're individuals.
[531.34 → 532.34] Okay.
[532.34 → 533.34] We have personalities.
[533.34 → 534.34] I...
[534.34 → 539.34] My concern is, it will feel weird in your pocket, or if I put too much weight on that
[539.34 → 542.34] wider part of the phone, maybe it'll bend it or something.
[542.34 → 543.34] Yeah.
[543.34 → 547.34] It just doesn't feel as clean as something that's just completely folded over.
[547.34 → 548.34] Right.
[548.34 → 549.34] Like the Huawei phone.
[549.34 → 550.34] That one's not completely folded over, is it?
[550.34 → 553.34] Well, but the screen's on the outside, so you don't need to worry about creasing the
[553.34 → 555.34] screen because the inside is completely flat.
[555.34 → 557.34] It's a complete flat crease.
[557.34 → 560.34] And on the outside, it can be curved because it's on the outside.
[560.34 → 561.34] You know what I'm saying?
[561.34 → 562.34] Yeah, I know what you're saying.
[562.34 → 563.34] Should I bring up a picture of it?
[563.34 → 564.34] That's true.
[564.34 → 565.34] You've seen it before.
[565.34 → 567.34] But then obviously there are concerns about now your screens are on the outside.
[567.34 → 568.34] Yes.
[568.34 → 570.34] But I mean, when I put this in my pocket, there's a screen on the outside?
[570.34 → 571.34] But your screen's always on the outside.
[571.34 → 572.34] Yeah, your screen's always on the outside.
[572.34 → 574.34] I don't put this in the same pocket as keys or nothing, right?
[574.34 → 575.34] No.
[575.34 → 576.34] As me?
[576.34 → 577.34] Yeah.
[577.34 → 578.34] Yeah.
[578.34 → 581.34] Although, you know, for some reason on jeans, there's like a little stud kind of...
[581.34 → 583.34] I don't know what that's for.
[583.34 → 584.34] Yeah.
[584.34 → 587.34] It's just like a vestige of like, this is what jeans look like to be cool.
[587.34 → 589.34] That's the main reason I don't wear jeans anymore.
[589.34 → 590.34] But you know what I'm talking about?
[590.34 → 594.34] The little metal kind of nipple that's at the top of a pocket, usually on the right
[594.34 → 595.34] side.
[595.34 → 599.34] Sometimes I slide my phone in my pocket with the back toward that just in case.
[599.34 → 603.34] Or other little considerations like that, other hazards, you're not going to be able
[603.34 → 605.34] to avoid as easily when you have screen on both sides.
[605.34 → 606.34] It'll be two-fold.
[606.34 → 607.34] That's true.
[607.34 → 608.34] But...
[608.34 → 609.34] Ah!
[609.34 → 611.34] We are the best at unintentional...
[611.34 → 613.34] I didn't plan that Doom fun at all.
[613.34 → 614.34] Really?
[614.34 → 615.34] No.
[615.34 → 616.34] Oh, that was good.
[616.34 → 617.34] I'm glad that you had that much confidence.
[617.34 → 621.34] I mean, I figured because like, screen protectors are... they're easy.
[621.34 → 626.34] You know, and if you could figure out a... the screen, the folding screen, you can figure
[626.34 → 628.34] out a folding screen protector.
[628.34 → 629.34] Maybe.
[629.34 → 630.34] I don't...
[630.34 → 631.34] I'm not an engineer.
[631.34 → 632.34] What do I know?
[632.34 → 633.34] Okay.
[633.34 → 634.34] Wait.
[634.34 → 636.34] Heating the display's crease?
[636.34 → 637.34] What's this about?
[637.34 → 638.34] Okay.
[638.34 → 640.34] So that's a list of patents that Apple already made.
[640.34 → 641.34] Oh.
[641.34 → 642.34] And some of them are more ambiguous.
[642.34 → 644.34] Like, hey, we're patenting a folding device.
[644.34 → 648.34] We're patenting a device that has its components in two different housing chambers.
[648.34 → 649.34] Okay.
[649.34 → 650.34] Fair enough.
[650.34 → 651.34] I don't think the folding phone's going to have that.
[651.34 → 653.34] But they had some more specific ones that are interesting.
[653.34 → 654.34] Like...
[654.34 → 655.34] Are they in here?
[655.34 → 659.46] I guess they must have done enough testing to figure out that it doesn't... the folding
[659.46 → 663.74] performance degrades in freezing climates.
[663.74 → 667.74] So I guess it would be, you know, more brittle, less pliable if it's cold.
[667.74 → 668.74] Oh.
[668.74 → 672.92] So what they did was they have a patent for heating up the area of the screen where it
[672.92 → 673.92] folds.
[673.92 → 677.92] And I think they did it just by turning on the pixels and just shining like light at them.
[677.92 → 678.92] What?
[678.92 → 679.92] I don't know.
[679.92 → 680.92] I'm going to read the whole patent myself.
[680.92 → 681.92] Or I haven't even read the whole abstract.
[681.92 → 683.92] Oh, but that's what this says somewhere.
[683.92 → 684.92] Oh, self-heated.
[684.92 → 685.92] Yeah, right there, guys.
[685.92 → 686.92] Yeah, yeah.
[686.92 → 687.92] Can we zoom in?
[687.92 → 688.92] This is pretty cool.
[688.92 → 692.92] The portion of the display that overlaps the bend axis may be self-heated by illuminating
[692.92 → 697.82] pixels in the portion of the display that overlap the bend axis or may be heated using
[697.82 → 700.04] a heating element or other heating structure.
[700.04 → 701.04] That's crazy.
[701.04 → 702.04] That's crazy.
[702.04 → 706.04] I don't, that, that, I don't like it.
[706.04 → 709.04] There's obviously thinking about it to the extent that they, you know.
[709.04 → 710.04] Apple's thinking.
[710.04 → 714.04] Who knows if they'll ever release one, but here's a question for you.
[714.04 → 715.04] Yes.
[715.04 → 717.04] Steve Jobs, okay.
[717.04 → 722.04] So, he seemed to have like vision for each of the products in terms of what would like
[722.04 → 724.04] the 10 out of 10 version of this product look like.
[724.04 → 728.04] Like to him, the 10 out of 10 version of a laptop was like a book.
[728.04 → 731.04] You know, in the early 90s, he always wanted to make a computer that just looked like a book
[731.04 → 732.04] and you can carry it around.
[732.04 → 733.04] Right.
[733.04 → 736.04] And then they eventually got to do that with the iPad, for example.
[736.04 → 737.04] Yeah, iPad sort of.
[737.04 → 742.04] So, what do you think his idea of the optimal folding phone would be?
[742.04 → 746.04] Because I feel like when he's unveiling the iPhone 5, he's like, this is the best phone
[746.04 → 747.04] design there is.
[747.04 → 748.04] It fits in your hand.
[748.04 → 750.04] If we still had iPad Jobs.
[750.04 → 751.04] Steve Jobs?
[751.04 → 752.04] Yeah.
[752.04 → 756.04] Would he like folding phones or not?
[756.04 → 758.04] Probably.
[758.04 → 760.04] I mean, this double.
[760.04 → 764.04] I mean, if the iPad was his idea for like, because, you know, he wanted people to have
[764.04 → 766.04] books, it's a folding phone.
[766.04 → 767.04] I don't know.
[767.04 → 772.04] You know, like, I just, it's hard for me to get excited about folding phones right now.
[772.04 → 773.04] Okay, the wallet.
[773.04 → 774.04] Because we all got excited.
[774.04 → 776.04] We all went there, James.
[776.04 → 777.04] I'm still excited.
[777.04 → 778.04] And we got hurt.
[778.04 → 779.04] It's new.
[779.04 → 781.04] It's a nascent category.
[781.04 → 785.04] Okay, check out that picture of the double folded phone.
[785.04 → 786.04] Kind of looks like a wallet.
[786.04 → 787.04] What, the one that...
[787.04 → 789.04] Oh no, we're going to update now?
[789.04 → 790.04] No.
[790.04 → 791.04] We're going to update tomorrow.
[791.04 → 792.04] Get out of here.
[792.04 → 793.04] No, it kind of looks like a wallet.
[793.04 → 798.04] And I feel like his emphasis on a computer looking like a real world analog object you're
[798.04 → 800.04] already familiar with, like a book.
[800.04 → 801.04] That's cool.
[801.04 → 803.04] He might have thought, hey, looking like a wallet is cool.
[803.04 → 805.04] You can, it's the only thing you need to carry with you.
[805.04 → 806.04] You don't need your wallet anymore.
[806.04 → 807.04] You have Apple Pay.
[807.04 → 812.04] But like, wallets are only okay to be in that kind of fold position because you sit on
[812.04 → 813.04] them.
[813.04 → 815.04] I put my wallet in my front pocket.
[815.04 → 816.04] Do you?
[816.04 → 817.04] Yeah.
[817.04 → 818.04] Do you have liked one of those thin walls?
[818.04 → 819.04] Oh, dude.
[819.04 → 820.04] I'm not going to have a wallet too.
[820.04 → 821.04] Not as thin as mine.
[821.04 → 824.04] But that's why it's double okay for me to put it in my back pocket.
[824.04 → 825.04] Look at that puppy.
[825.04 → 828.04] Why would you want that in your back pocket?
[828.04 → 829.04] Pretty close.
[829.04 → 832.04] Now, if this was a phone, I could be even thinner than you.
[832.04 → 833.04] Oh, wow.
[833.04 → 834.04] Look at that.
[834.04 → 836.04] And with that, it's time to move on.
[836.04 → 837.04] You're done, bud.
[837.04 → 838.04] It's over.
[838.04 → 839.04] Yeah.
[839.04 → 840.04] Okay, what's next?
[840.04 → 842.04] Well, you get to tell me all about Xbox.
[842.04 → 843.04] Or what, you want to talk more?
[843.04 → 844.04] You got more to say about the folding phone?
[844.04 → 845.04] That's good enough.
[845.04 → 846.04] The thing you love so much?
[846.04 → 848.04] I'm willing to try it.
[848.04 → 849.04] I'm not writing it off.
[849.04 → 850.04] I got hurt.
[850.04 → 851.04] I went into, it's like a relationship.
[851.04 → 852.04] I don't want to get hurt again.
[852.04 → 853.04] You know, it's toxic at this point.
[853.04 → 856.04] It's not like you spent three grand on one.
[856.04 → 861.04] Well, I spent a lot of my time talking about it and reading about it.
[861.04 → 862.04] Huh.
[862.04 → 863.04] Let's move on.
[863.04 → 865.04] Okay, guys.
[865.04 → 869.04] You want to hear about Xbox Game Pass for PC?
[869.04 → 870.04] Microsoft, now.
[870.04 → 871.04] Everyone's like, yeah!
[871.04 → 873.04] I can hear them.
[873.04 → 876.04] Microsoft, oh, he would not.
[876.04 → 877.04] Who?
[877.04 → 878.04] Oh, Steve Jobs.
[878.04 → 880.04] They're saying that Steve Jobs wouldn't like folding phones.
[880.04 → 881.04] Who said that?
[881.04 → 882.04] The chat.
[882.04 → 883.04] All the chat?
[883.04 → 884.04] Some of the chat.
[884.04 → 886.04] I want names!
[886.04 → 887.04] Yeah.
[887.04 → 889.04] Well, we got UCM Rich.
[889.04 → 891.04] That's enough names.
[891.04 → 892.04] Sorry.
[892.04 → 893.04] I knew it was Rich.
[893.04 → 894.04] I got Cerebra.
[894.04 → 895.04] I knew it was that guy.
[895.04 → 896.04] With all the fans.
[896.04 → 897.04] All the viewers.
[897.04 → 899.04] Um, okay.
[899.04 → 901.04] Xbox Game Pass for PC.
[901.04 → 903.04] Now, they're doing it.
[903.04 → 905.04] And that's the main thing.
[905.04 → 906.04] That's the big takeaway.
[906.04 → 907.04] Okay, let me get this straight.
[907.04 → 908.04] What do you know about it?
[908.04 → 909.04] Okay, here's what I know.
[909.04 → 914.04] I know that Xbox Game Pass is a subscription service, which I believe is $10 a month on the
[914.04 → 915.04] Xbox One.
[915.04 → 916.04] Mm-hmm.
[916.04 → 918.04] It gives you access to a library of games.
[918.04 → 919.04] That library of games.
[919.04 → 920.04] It's just like Netflix, but games.
[920.04 → 922.04] That library of games gets updated with new games.
[922.04 → 927.04] As I understand it, Microsoft tries to have launches be simultaneous.
[927.04 → 931.04] So, if Sforza 4 comes out independently, it comes out.
[931.04 → 934.04] It should launch the same day on Game Pass.
[934.04 → 935.04] Also, as I understand it...
[935.04 → 937.04] If it's an Xbox Game Studios title.
[937.04 → 939.04] Yeah, they have more control over those.
[939.04 → 940.04] Right.
[940.04 → 944.04] But, um, I also understand that people are pretty stoked on Game Pass.
[944.04 → 946.04] Like, the games on it don't suck.
[946.04 → 948.04] It's not like they're only indie games or something.
[948.04 → 950.04] Have they shown what games are on it?
[950.04 → 952.04] Game Pass has been around for a long time.
[952.04 → 953.04] No, no, I know.
[953.04 → 954.04] But the thing is, the thing that's weird about this...
[954.04 → 955.04] And let me...
[955.04 → 956.04] The PC version.
[956.04 → 957.04] Boom.
[957.04 → 962.04] The thing that's weird about this one is that it's not just literally the exact same
[962.04 → 967.04] program being ported to PC, it's a separate program for PC, like, with PC games.
[967.04 → 968.04] Yeah, of course.
[968.04 → 969.04] It's not like you're getting Xbox games on PC.
[969.04 → 970.04] Right.
[970.04 → 974.04] So, it's kind of like, well, are they going to have good PC titles?
[974.04 → 980.04] Like, they have Bethesda in there, Deep Silver, Revolver Digital, Paradox, Sega, and then
[980.04 → 983.04] Xbox Zone stuff that they are talking about right now.
[983.04 → 984.04] Mm-hmm.
[984.04 → 986.04] But, like, is there an actual list of games that they're going to have?
[986.04 → 989.04] They're going to give us way more details, we think, at E3.
[989.04 → 990.04] Okay.
[990.04 → 991.04] Yeah.
[991.04 → 993.04] The big part of this...
[993.04 → 996.04] Well, okay, so let's continue summarizing Game Pass.
[996.04 → 997.04] Like, that's...
[997.04 → 998.04] So, that's basically what it is.
[998.04 → 999.04] 10 bucks a month, and you don't get to...
[999.04 → 1001.04] It's not streaming, you know?
[1001.04 → 1002.04] No, you can download them.
[1002.04 → 1003.04] You're downloading them...
[1003.04 → 1004.04] You don't own them.
[1004.04 → 1005.04] Right.
[1005.04 → 1008.04] You can play them, and they can get removed from the Game Pass library.
[1008.04 → 1010.04] If a game gets removed...
[1010.04 → 1011.04] Hmm.
[1011.04 → 1012.04] I mean, just like...
[1012.04 → 1013.04] They give you advance warning.
[1013.04 → 1014.04] Yeah.
[1014.04 → 1016.04] It gets removed, your save game remains.
[1016.04 → 1019.04] So, you could, in theory, go and buy the game, and you'll still have your save.
[1019.04 → 1020.04] So, you're not going to lose it.
[1020.04 → 1021.04] Well, that's not so bad.
[1021.04 → 1022.04] It's not so bad.
[1022.04 → 1025.04] But, you know, it's like any subscription service.
[1025.04 → 1031.04] Like, I go on Netflix, and I went to watch one of the Lord of the Rings, like, recently, and it was gone.
[1031.04 → 1032.04] Oh, yeah.
[1032.04 → 1034.04] There's nothing I want on Canadian Netflix.
[1034.04 → 1038.04] But, there's some people, like, Sforza was a big one when it came out.
[1038.04 → 1042.04] For some people, a new game comes out like that, it's going to be 60 bucks.
[1042.04 → 1043.04] Yeah.
[1043.04 → 1044.04] That's six months of the service.
[1044.04 → 1047.04] Like, the service is worth it for one game.
[1047.04 → 1050.04] Like, it pays for itself after one game that you really like.
[1050.04 → 1055.04] Now, if I'm not mistaken, there are services like this on PC already, like EA Access.
[1055.04 → 1056.04] Mm-hmm.
[1056.04 → 1065.04] But, I guess this will, I mean, I wonder if there will be, like, cross, uh, contamination.
[1065.04 → 1068.04] No, you know, like, games on multiple services?
[1068.04 → 1069.04] Yeah.
[1069.04 → 1073.04] So, Microsoft is still going to be putting their games in other places, like Steam and stuff like that.
[1073.04 → 1074.04] Oh, okay.
[1074.04 → 1079.04] Well, and that's the other big thing from this announcement, is that they're going to be putting more games on Steam.
[1079.04 → 1088.04] That's what excites me about this, because, uh, before, I think they have, the Master Chief Collection, they said, was coming to Steam, and I think Halo Wars is on Steam.
[1088.04 → 1089.04] Okay.
[1089.04 → 1104.04] But, they have said, Microsoft, that they're going to be releasing more games in Win32 format, um, so they will be on Steam, they might be on other stores, like the Epic Games Store, or whatever.
[1104.04 → 1115.04] So, that is exciting, to me, because that means that Microsoft is actually starting to walk the walk now, and not just talk the talk about how they wanna care about PC gamers.
[1115.04 → 1116.04] Yeah.
[1116.04 → 1124.04] I think, overall, under Satya Nadella, Microsoft seems to be kind of decoupling, like, they're trying to be less of a platform, more of a service.
[1124.04 → 1130.04] They're trying to be less siloed, and more kind of, um, modular, which is pretty sweet.
[1130.04 → 1131.04] I think it's working out for them.
[1131.04 → 1140.04] What I wonder about this announcement is whether it's ever going to be one kind of harmonious thing with the console.
[1140.04 → 1141.04] You know what I mean?
[1141.04 → 1143.04] I think that's their endgame.
[1143.04 → 1146.04] How far away is that?
[1146.04 → 1156.04] Well, that's, this is the funny thing about it, is because that's what the whole point was of making Universal Windows apps, and putting them on Xbox and the Windows Store.
[1156.04 → 1157.04] Mm-hmm.
[1157.04 → 1169.04] So, but everyone hated that, because you can only go buy these games, like, you can buy the game on PC, but you can only go buy it from the Windows Store, in UWP format, which, you know, you can't, like, you can only launch it through the Windows Store.
[1169.04 → 1172.04] It's not like, there's all these Jacky things about it.
[1172.04 → 1173.04] Yeah.
[1173.04 → 1179.04] So now they've basically, this is them basically saying, yeah, the whole UWP thing, yeah, we're, that's, we're kind of done with that.
[1179.04 → 1180.04] Yeah.
[1180.04 → 1181.04] Yeah.
[1181.04 → 1184.04] And so, yeah, what does that mean for their endgame?
[1184.04 → 1191.04] If they want to make games, basically, just like, you buy the game, you have it on Xbox, you have it on Microsoft on PC.
[1191.04 → 1196.04] Like, eventually the idea is that on Xbox, you have it on Microsoft on PC.
[1196.04 → 1201.04] Like, eventually the idea is that those won't even be separate files.
[1201.04 → 1209.04] Like, an Xbox is just going to be another, I mean, it's going to be interesting when they launch the next Xbox, to see whether it is, like, a console in the same way.
[1209.04 → 1212.04] Or whether it's just, like, a PC.
[1212.04 → 1218.04] Well, here's an extra data point for that theory, which is something called Xbox Game Pass Unlimited.
[1218.04 → 1219.04] Ooh.
[1219.04 → 1220.04] Which is, it's announced, but it's not out yet.
[1220.04 → 1224.04] I keep, I forgot the stream was on the document.
[1224.04 → 1225.04] It was just looking at the document the whole time?
[1225.04 → 1226.04] Yeah, dude.
[1226.04 → 1227.04] No.
[1227.04 → 1228.04] Now they know all of our secrets.
[1228.04 → 1229.04] Oh, no, that's okay.
[1229.04 → 1230.04] Yeah.
[1230.04 → 1231.04] But it's just a little, it's boring.
[1231.04 → 1233.04] If you're gonna talk for a long time, it should be on your face, you know?
[1233.04 → 1234.04] Yeah, well, you should be on your face.
[1234.04 → 1235.04] I am on my face.
[1235.04 → 1236.04] Ugh, damn.
[1236.04 → 1237.04] I'm under my face.
[1237.04 → 1242.04] Okay, so Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is announced, not out yet.
[1242.04 → 1247.04] And what it is, is its essentially just a bundle of Xbox Live Gold and Xbox Game Pass.
[1247.04 → 1248.04] Oh.
[1248.04 → 1249.04] It's not really cheaper.
[1249.04 → 1250.04] Okay.
[1250.04 → 1254.04] So, Game Pass is, what, $10 a month for $120 a year?
[1254.04 → 1261.04] And then Xbox Live is also $10 a month if you pay month by month, but if you buy a year up front, it's $60.
[1261.04 → 1274.04] So, if you take the cost of a year of Xbox Live up front, it's $60, and you add that to $120 of Xbox Game Pass for a year, that equals $180, which is the exact same annual price as Game Pass Ultimate.
[1274.04 → 1275.04] Oh.
[1275.04 → 1283.04] So, there's not really any savings, except for, you know, if you're the type of person who does get month-to-month Xbox Live, it's a saving in that way.
[1283.04 → 1286.04] And you have more freedom, because you can cancel at any time, you're not kind of locked in.
[1286.04 → 1296.04] However, there's now rumours that Ultimate is going to include, with no extra cost, Xbox Game Pass for a PC.
[1296.04 → 1297.04] Oh.
[1297.04 → 1299.04] So, then it is a savings.
[1299.04 → 1300.04] Okay.
[1300.04 → 1301.04] That is a deal.
[1301.04 → 1302.04] Yeah.
[1302.04 → 1305.04] And it's also interesting from a strategic point of view.
[1306.04 → 1307.04] Because I don't get it.
[1307.04 → 1309.04] It's like, why did they do that?
[1309.04 → 1314.04] Did they do it to sell more Xbox Game Pass subscriptions?
[1314.04 → 1316.04] Because it's not helping you sell Boxes.
[1316.04 → 1321.04] Well, the more people that you have using your platform.
[1321.04 → 1332.04] I mean, like, if somebody has an Xbox and a PC, and they sign up for it, and they're, you know, using your Xbox, but then like, oh, their brother's using the Xbox, and then they go to play on the PC, they can technically say that's, you know, too.
[1332.04 → 1335.04] Like, this many people are playing on PC.
[1335.04 → 1336.04] You know?
[1336.04 → 1340.04] When, really, that person mainly got it for Xbox, and they decided to play it on his PC a little bit, too.
[1340.04 → 1351.04] Like, I'm trying to figure out if they're trying to drive more customers on the PC end, or if they're using PC players and driving customers on the console end, or kind of both, or what the big idea is.
[1351.04 → 1352.04] I think it's both.
[1352.04 → 1353.04] I feel like...
[1353.04 → 1356.04] It might be one on the short term, and a different one on the long term.
[1356.04 → 1365.04] I think that this might be just part of Microsoft's push that they're doing right now to, like, make people like them again.
[1365.04 → 1366.04] Please.
[1366.04 → 1373.04] By saying, hey, you want a Game Pass? Well, you can have it on Xbox and PC. Please use our products.
[1373.04 → 1375.04] You can have it on Nintendo Switch.
[1375.04 → 1381.04] Please buy Boxes, because we don't have good exclusives.
[1381.04 → 1382.04] Hey.
[1382.04 → 1383.04] They don't!
[1383.04 → 1384.04] PlayStation got all the good...
[1384.04 → 1387.04] I was an Xbox guy my whole childhood, okay?
[1387.04 → 1390.04] I've never had a PlayStation, but I recognize that they have better exclusives.
[1390.04 → 1391.04] That's just the way it is.
[1391.04 → 1393.04] Yeah, it always has been.
[1393.04 → 1396.04] Okay, moving on.
[1396.04 → 1398.04] We have to keep it moving here, James.
[1398.04 → 1399.04] We have to keep it going here.
[1399.04 → 1402.04] Unless people have something very important to say about...
[1402.04 → 1405.04] Oh, I got stuck in the chat.
[1405.04 → 1406.04] The chat got stuck way up there.
[1406.04 → 1408.04] Is it...
[1408.04 → 1409.04] Halo!
[1409.04 → 1410.04] I know Halo.
[1410.04 → 1411.04] I love Halo, okay?
[1411.04 → 1412.04] Halo's great.
[1412.04 → 1413.04] Obviously Halo.
[1413.04 → 1414.04] But that's like one game series.
[1414.04 → 1415.04] Halo and Sforza are pretty much...
[1415.04 → 1416.04] Sforza.
[1416.04 → 1417.04] That's all anyone talks about.
[1417.04 → 1419.04] I do not play racing games, so that's not interesting to me.
[1419.04 → 1420.04] People...
[1420.04 → 1422.04] I can feel this disturbance.
[1422.04 → 1423.04] Fans everywhere are crying out.
[1423.04 → 1425.04] You don't play racing games?!
[1425.04 → 1427.04] Um, okay.
[1427.04 → 1428.04] Both is good.
[1428.04 → 1429.04] Alright, yes.
[1429.04 → 1430.04] Both is good.
[1430.04 → 1431.04] Sorry, guys.
[1431.04 → 1432.04] Yeah, I always loved that meme from years ago.
[1432.04 → 1433.04] It was like,
[1433.04 → 1434.04] Console Wars.
[1434.04 → 1436.04] When mommy can only afford one.
[1436.04 → 1437.04] Yeah.
[1437.04 → 1439.04] Luckily, I'm a grown-up now.
[1439.04 → 1442.04] Yeah, well, I don't have any consoles.
[1442.04 → 1443.04] You say consoles.
[1443.04 → 1444.04] Okay, how...
[1444.04 → 1445.04] How...
[1445.04 → 1446.04] What did you mean?
[1446.04 → 1447.04] How do you say it?
[1447.04 → 1448.04] Console.
[1448.04 → 1449.04] You say console.
[1449.04 → 1450.04] Console.
[1450.04 → 1452.04] Yeah, you're saying it like the advisor.
[1452.04 → 1453.04] Like a console.
[1453.04 → 1454.04] You're saying it like,
[1454.04 → 1455.04] I console my friend.
[1455.04 → 1457.04] I'm saying consoles.
[1457.04 → 1459.04] It sounds like you're talking about...
[1459.04 → 1462.04] It's the difference between consoles and consoles.
[1462.04 → 1463.04] I console you.
[1463.04 → 1464.04] You say...
[1464.04 → 1465.04] I play a console.
[1465.04 → 1468.04] It sounds like you're saying with shoes in Spanish.
[1468.04 → 1469.04] Console.
[1469.04 → 1471.04] I'm here with...
[1471.04 → 1472.04] No, that's...
[1472.04 → 1473.04] That's...
[1473.04 → 1474.04] That's consoles.
[1474.04 → 1476.04] So ya Que consoles.
[1476.04 → 1480.04] I know that shoes isn't soles in Spanish.
[1480.04 → 1481.04] You're saying...
[1481.04 → 1482.04] You're saying it wrong.
[1482.04 → 1483.04] I'm saying it right.
[1483.04 → 1484.04] How do you say milk?
[1484.04 → 1485.04] I'm dropping a letter.
[1485.04 → 1486.04] How do you say milk?
[1486.04 → 1487.04] Milk.
[1487.04 → 1492.04] I drink a glass of milk, and then I lay my head on my pillow.
[1492.04 → 1493.04] Yeah, pillow.
[1493.04 → 1494.04] See...
[1494.04 → 1495.04] And then I put the milk back in the fridge.
[1495.04 → 1496.04] I say pillow.
[1496.04 → 1497.04] My mom says fridge.
[1497.04 → 1500.04] Hey guys, welcome to the grammar show.
[1500.04 → 1501.04] Pronunciation show.
[1501.04 → 1503.04] Brought to you by...
[1503.04 → 1505.04] Brought to you by Quake 3 Arena.
[1505.04 → 1506.04] No, let's do this part.
[1506.04 → 1507.04] Are we doing it now?
[1507.04 → 1508.04] Yes.
[1508.04 → 1509.04] We've only done two stories.
[1509.04 → 1510.04] Look at the time, my friend.
[1510.04 → 1511.04] You're a time.
[1511.04 → 1512.04] Look at the time.
[1512.04 → 1514.04] Brought to you by...
[1514.04 → 1515.04] Console.
[1515.04 → 1516.04] Savage jerky.
[1516.04 → 1519.04] Hey, there's some savage jerky over there.
[1519.04 → 1520.04] Oh my gosh.
[1520.04 → 1521.04] You better eat some.
[1521.04 → 1522.04] Look at this.
[1522.04 → 1523.04] Sriracha.
[1523.04 → 1524.04] Sriracha bacon.
[1524.04 → 1525.04] Oh, and there's...
[1525.04 → 1527.04] You don't have the stuff up?
[1527.04 → 1528.04] Nope.
[1528.04 → 1530.04] Go back to this.
[1530.04 → 1531.04] Sriracha bacon, I mean...
[1531.04 → 1533.04] It originates in Thailand.
[1533.04 → 1537.04] It's a series of consonants I can't pronounce properly, for sure.
[1537.04 → 1539.04] Their jerky is made with the best ingredients.
[1539.04 → 1541.04] Without nitrates or preservatives.
[1541.04 → 1546.04] With a goal to create a snack that is full of flavour and spice that isn't bad for you.
[1546.04 → 1547.04] Some spices are bad for you.
[1547.04 → 1548.04] Nitrates.
[1548.04 → 1550.04] Oh, I see what you're saying.
[1550.04 → 1555.04] They've got 13 different flavours of jerky like sriracha bacon and maple buffalo bacon.
[1555.04 → 1558.04] They also make barbecue sauce, hot sauce, and...
[1558.04 → 1559.04] Oh no, what are you doing?
[1559.04 → 1560.04] A spice rub.
[1560.04 → 1561.04] I'm opening it.
[1561.04 → 1562.04] He's going for it.
[1562.04 → 1565.04] Their Carolina Reaper hot sauce uses one of the hottest peppers in the world.
[1565.04 → 1566.04] Did you know that?
[1566.04 → 1567.04] That puppy's hot.
[1567.04 → 1568.04] That puppy's hot.
[1568.04 → 1569.04] I can smell that.
[1569.04 → 1572.04] Use offer code LTT to save 10% on all their products.
[1572.04 → 1575.04] I think this is going to be a little hotter than he expects.
[1575.04 → 1578.04] You've got to eat it like a baby bird like that?
[1578.04 → 1580.04] No mouth noises, man.
[1580.04 → 1581.04] Okay, sorry.
[1581.04 → 1582.04] Rip headphone users.
[1582.04 → 1583.04] Well, that means you have to do the next one.
[1583.04 → 1584.04] Okay.
[1584.04 → 1585.04] Thanks, Savage Jerky.
[1585.04 → 1586.04] Love ya.
[1586.04 → 1589.04] Next up, private internet access.
[1589.04 → 1591.04] Do I get to eat the private internet access?
[1591.04 → 1592.04] Nope.
[1592.04 → 1593.04] Okay.
[1593.04 → 1594.04] I did that one.
[1594.04 → 1597.04] Private internet access supports a variety of VPN protocols and types of encryption and
[1597.04 → 1602.04] authentication, allowing you to dial into the exact level of privacy protection that you need.
[1602.04 → 1606.04] There are apps for Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Linus.
[1606.04 → 1607.04] Linus.
[1607.04 → 1610.04] This actually says Linus and not Linux.
[1610.04 → 1612.04] Is this a prank?
[1612.04 → 1617.04] There's an app for Linus, Linux, and Google Chrome with support for several other platforms coming soon.
[1617.04 → 1619.04] These guys are hustling.
[1619.04 → 1622.04] Connect up to five devices at the same time, which is important.
[1622.04 → 1623.04] To be a...
[1623.04 → 1629.04] In the world of ever expanding device ownership, internet of things.
[1629.04 → 1631.04] You know how many devices are in my house?
[1631.04 → 1632.04] Dozens.
[1632.04 → 1633.04] More than five.
[1633.04 → 1635.04] Well, my phone, her phone.
[1635.04 → 1636.04] Well, PC.
[1636.04 → 1639.04] Not more than five that you have to be protected.
[1639.04 → 1640.04] No, I don't need...
[1640.04 → 1642.04] I'm not going to use a VPN on my Google Home.
[1642.04 → 1643.04] That's not going to...
[1643.04 → 1644.04] Yeah.
[1644.04 → 1645.04] Five is a great number.
[1645.04 → 1649.04] And the apps include DNS leak protection and IPv6 leak protection.
[1649.04 → 1654.04] They also have this really neat feature that people love to have, and I like to say it.
[1654.04 → 1656.04] They have an internet kill switch.
[1656.04 → 1657.04] Hit the kill switch.
[1657.04 → 1658.04] The kill switch.
[1658.04 → 1659.04] Block the internet traffic.
[1659.04 → 1663.04] If the VPN becomes disconnected unexpectedly, you just smash it.
[1663.04 → 1667.04] You can check it out today at leg.GG slash Pagan.
[1667.04 → 1668.04] Do it.
[1668.04 → 1673.04] I think I've said this before, that Pagan really looks like a Philippine...
[1673.04 → 1675.04] An island in the Philippines.
[1675.04 → 1676.04] Pia wan.
[1676.04 → 1677.04] Pia wan.
[1677.04 → 1678.04] It looks like that.
[1678.04 → 1679.04] That sounds like a place I want to go to.
[1679.04 → 1680.04] And finally...
[1680.04 → 1684.04] And nowhere else I want to go to, squarespace.com slash WAN, because we use Squarespace, guys.
[1684.04 → 1685.04] No joke.

[1686.04 → 1687.04] We actually use it.
[1687.04 → 1694.04] And both of our LinusMediaGroup.com and LCXExpo.com websites were built quickly using Squarespace.
[1694.04 → 1695.04] They weren't just built.
[1695.04 → 1696.04] They were built quickly.
[1696.04 → 1699.04] And if you know us, you know they were built quickly.
[1699.04 → 1703.04] And by Colton, and with questionable writing on them.
[1703.04 → 1709.04] So if you haven't heard already, Squarespace is an all-in-one platform that makes it easy to get your website up and running quickly.

[1716.04 → 1719.04] The times that I've used Squarespace, it's actually, yeah, very easy to use.
[1719.04 → 1722.04] I like the template that has a macro shot of a burger.
[1722.04 → 1723.04] Yeah?
[1723.04 → 1724.04] You know?
[1724.04 → 1725.04] I haven't seen that one.

[1743.04 → 1747.04] I just saw Matias carrying a pizza box in the garbage.
[1747.04 → 1749.04] I was like, kind of...
[1749.04 → 1750.04] No!
[1750.04 → 1752.04] But also, yeah, that was in the fridge all week.
[1752.04 → 1753.04] All right.
[1753.04 → 1754.04] It's been two weeks, actually.
[1754.04 → 1755.04] Two weeks.
[1755.04 → 1756.04] Oh, wait.
[1756.04 → 1757.04] Hold on.
[1757.04 → 1758.04] He's putting it in his car now.
[1758.04 → 1759.04] Matias!
[1759.04 → 1760.04] Matias, what are you doing over there, buddy?
[1760.04 → 1762.04] Iron stomach Matias, we call him.
[1762.04 → 1765.04] Do we have anything to say about LTX?
[1765.04 → 1766.04] It's going to be lit.
[1766.04 → 1767.04] It's going to be sweet.
[1767.04 → 1768.04] It's going to be lit, dude.
[1768.04 → 1769.04] I get to be the showrunner.
[1769.04 → 1770.04] We're going to have a stage with various panels.
[1770.04 → 1771.04] Wow!
[1771.04 → 1772.04] I get to...
[1772.04 → 1774.04] I don't think I'm allowed to roast people in between shows.
[1774.04 → 1775.04] Am I on a panel?
[1775.04 → 1776.04] I don't know.
[1776.04 → 1777.04] Honestly, I don't know.
[1777.04 → 1778.04] We don't know who's going to be on what panel yet.
[1778.04 → 1779.04] Um...
[1779.04 → 1780.04] I like that you guys agree how to pronounce template.
[1780.04 → 1781.04] What do you say?
[1781.04 → 1782.04] Template.
[1782.04 → 1783.04] Oh, this person likes template.
[1783.04 → 1784.04] Someone says we're saying template wrong.
[1784.04 → 1785.04] Template?
[1785.04 → 1786.04] Uh, a template or a template.
[1786.04 → 1791.04] Sometimes I like to contemplate the different templates we use.
[1791.04 → 1792.04] And, okay, guys.
[1792.04 → 1793.04] Yeah, it's not a problem.
[1793.04 → 1794.04] Robots.
[1794.04 → 1795.04] They're taking over.
[1795.04 → 1796.04] I love...
[1796.04 → 1797.04] This is the next topic.
[1797.04 → 1798.04] I love DeepMind.
[1798.04 → 1799.04] You love him?
[1799.04 → 1800.04] Yeah, it's not a problem.
[1800.04 → 1801.04] Oh, I love DeepMind.
[1801.04 → 1802.04] I'm like, okay.
[1802.04 → 1803.04] Yeah, dad.
[1803.04 → 1804.04] You love him?
[1804.04 → 1805.04] Yeah, dad, you're like, man.
[1805.04 → 1806.04] I'm like, okay.
[1806.04 → 1807.04] You're like, man.
[1807.04 → 1808.04] You're like, man.
[1808.04 → 1809.04] Oh, no.
[1809.04 → 1810.04] You're like, man.
[1810.04 → 1811.04] You're like, man.
[1811.04 → 1812.04] Yeah, you're like, man.
[1812.04 → 1813.04] Yeah.
[1813.04 → 1814.04] I'm like, man.
[1814.04 → 1821.80] you love them I love deep mind they're awesome three arena nothing is safe anymore no okay so
[1821.80 → 1827.88] the context here I'm sure a lot of our viewers know this deep mind is a subsidiary of Google
[1827.88 → 1835.72] they make uh they primarily use machine learning to make AI they are advancing AI via gaming
[1835.72 → 1841.40] because the world of gaming have these really discrete scenarios that you can control you can
[1841.40 → 1846.12] control a number of variables it's a lot simpler than trying to make an AI that can just live in
[1846.12 → 1852.28] the world on planet earth like we can, it's a good place so they started off with chess uh they made
[1852.28 → 1857.24] several AI that just destroyed everything that ever had existed in chess in a short amount of time than
[1857.24 → 1863.56] any other robot unable to do it then they advanced into the world of go a game that was hitherto
[1863.56 → 1869.32] unknown by many westerners, but it is huge in China probably even bigger than chess is in the west
[1869.32 → 1876.36] uh it's a more complex game than chess go our alpha go which is made by deep mind is the best system
[1877.32 → 1883.08] living or silicon in the world yeah that can play go then they moved on to star craft and they
[1883.08 → 1888.12] started smashing some pros at star craft in certain ways it wasn't a completely fair fight, but it was
[1888.12 → 1894.76] still impressive, and now they're approaching the holy grail it's uh it's scary first-person shooters
[1894.76 → 1901.88] because is this the first one that um I don't I don't know if this is scarier or not by virtue of
[1901.88 → 1907.16] it being in 3d but is this the first one that like features an AI like controlling an avatar in 3d
[1907.16 → 1912.52] like kind of moving around like dota and star craft you know you can from these tell units to go places
[1912.52 → 1918.76] from deep mind I believe it is I can't speak to whether or not there are other um 3d game playing AI
[1918.76 → 1923.40] I suspect there probably are um they're probably not as good as this one like the regular AI in every
[1923.96 → 1926.04] shooter game but this is different
[1929.40 → 1933.88] but those aren't those are programmed they're not like yeah those aren't conscious like this one is
[1933.88 → 1938.12] they're running yeah those are running scripts they're not they didn't teach themselves like
[1938.12 → 1942.20] the way that bind trains us is just aren't we just running scripts jams
[1942.20 → 1953.64] oh no I wish we had a like a replica pistol that I could just cock and point at my that would have
[1953.64 → 1959.24] been a great sound yeah for that um but yeah so this machine just was taught the rule it wasn't even
[1959.24 → 1963.80] taught the rules it's put into the game space it has some kind of prime directive like win points
[1963.80 → 1969.00] go back to the main yeah go to us before I start scrolling like crazy sorry if that irritates anybody
[1969.00 → 1973.80] where I'm just like scrolling through the article this machine is playing against itself okay it's
[1973.80 → 1978.20] learning the rules by playing against itself it's learning strategies by playing it against itself
[1978.20 → 1984.92] it's playing against itself 200 000 times yeah yeah that's crazy it I couldn't find something
[1985.56 → 1991.08] saying how long that took it to play 200 000 matches because I know that with the data one like it is'll
[1991.08 → 1996.52] play like a thousand matches in like an afternoon minutes or something yeah yeah yeah like something
[1996.52 → 2003.40] ridiculous like that so like when it uh had played a hundred thousand matches it beat humans
[2003.40 → 2008.44] like okay but then when it would crush me after that by the times it doubled that match count it would
[2008.44 → 2014.44] it was just like destroying everybody yeah so what they say is that it was beating I think they were
[2014.44 → 2023.96] doing 2v2 and two humans yeah 2v2 two bots versus two humans got on average they were playing
[2023.96 → 2031.00] capture the flag they got on average 16 fewer flags per game okay I like I guess they
[2031.00 → 2034.84] didn't have a flags you need to win I guess they didn't have a cap on how many flags you can grab
[2034.84 → 2041.16] I've played quake at land parties here with all of us and I don't think anyone got like 16 or
[2041.16 → 2046.04] 20 points it must have been like a timed game or something it seems like the purpose of this
[2046.04 → 2052.68] whole setup was not to have the bots win but just to humiliate the human players well it's really cool
[2052.68 → 2057.88] how they did it they did something called like a evolutionary or genetic approach to the
[2057.88 → 2064.60] training so they have multiple like iterations of the machine like the game is populated only by
[2064.60 → 2069.40] different iterations of the machine there's no it's not learning against human players it's just all
[2070.28 → 2078.60] deep minds in there and then whichever ones suck just get destroyed their code gets discarded they
[2078.60 → 2085.08] mutate the remaining code uh which makes it kind of like a random new a random mutation just like an
[2085.08 → 2090.92] evolution and then if that is better than it gets to stay so when they when these machines first plop
[2090.92 → 2099.40] into the level uh they first just they first figured out the concept of I have a base this is my base then
[2099.40 → 2105.32] through more playing they figured just figured that out yes this is my base yes and I'm blue it's blue and
[2105.32 → 2110.92] then they figured out there's another base there's an opposing team's base then later they figured out
[2111.64 → 2116.76] it's advantageous to kill the other players like they have to go through the entire thing so they
[2116.76 → 2122.84] didn't tell them any of this no that's and that is what is truly horrifying not horrifying
[2122.84 → 2126.68] like fascinating, but it's like it's kind of like that sick fascination when you're watching a horror
[2126.68 → 2131.88] movie and like the bad guy is like eviscerating somebody in like a really unusual way, and you're
[2131.88 → 2137.08] like what is he doing do you know what eviscerating means taking your organs out doesn't it okay i
[2137.08 → 2143.72] thought you just you do know okay I thought you know interesting way I thought you meant well you
[2143.72 → 2148.36] can just grab the organs, or you can be like you know you can draw yeah you can do it on there
[2149.16 → 2155.16] anyway it's that kind of horrible yeah where I'm just kind of like they taught themselves and then
[2155.16 → 2159.88] they learned Shakespeare or something or they wrote Shakespeare that was the difference between
[2159.88 → 2164.92] alpha go and alpha zero you mean Shakespeare's or yeah is that what you're saying no I mean like
[2164.92 → 2170.36] eventually if you leave them in the quake simulation for long enough there's a whole civilization 100
[2170.36 → 2174.84] monkeys typing on it yeah on typewriters yeah eventually the difference between alpha go which
[2174.84 → 2180.12] was the original chess playing one and alpha zero was with alpha go they taught it the rules of chess
[2180.12 → 2185.40] and they gave it matches historical matches between pros, and they got to observe human players
[2185.40 → 2191.88] and then learn from there with alpha zero they were just like play yourself, and it just figured
[2191.88 → 2196.36] it figured out the game and then at the end they say, and it sounds like these congratulations you played
[2196.36 → 2205.40] yourself we're all losers I've learned how to do puns while working here oh you don't have more things
[2205.40 → 2210.28] no that's all I had time to put in today oh really yeah we can keep talking, but there's you know there's
[2210.28 → 2216.84] more topics at the bottom so I figured we can lean on those which is where we are now no, but there's
[2216.84 → 2221.80] more it's an interesting question than how will this affect game design because well let's not get
[2221.80 → 2226.60] there yet let's go to the previous question which is how I think leads into the second question how will
[2226.60 → 2233.32] human players use AI yeah because think about when there became AI for chess like you can play
[2233.96 → 2237.64] just against the computer when you're playing chess I think a lot of people do that a lot of people
[2237.64 → 2242.44] train that way a lot of beginners do it too you don't have anyone to play with right what's it
[2242.44 → 2247.96] going to be like when let's say it's star craft you're playing star craft and the best star craft player
[2247.96 → 2255.16] is the AI like this machine learned strategies right yeah, and you would think that it would kind
[2255.16 → 2263.16] of converge on an optimal strategy and then so if the pros are training by playing AI and not training
[2263.16 → 2268.92] by playing humans then the pros are going to mimic what the AI does and then all the humans are going
[2268.92 → 2274.52] to be trying to play like the AI and then that kind of makes you think okay does that mean that
[2275.24 → 2280.12] the AI has found the best strategy for that game like for example if you're talking about a game like
[2280.12 → 2284.04] star craft where there are myriad strategies you could go you could go brood lords, or you could
[2284.60 → 2289.32] go hard roaches or whatever if you're a zero player jams used to play star craft
[2293.08 → 2296.84] this one would be like okay every single time you should this is the build you should do
[2297.48 → 2303.00] yeah and if your game is like that where there's only one like the meta is limited there's this is
[2303.00 → 2308.60] the way to play well I feel is that a worse game than a game that where like actually there are multiple
[2308.60 → 2313.72] ways you can go, and it's always interesting and is that going to impact game design going forward well I feel
[2313.72 → 2321.00] like in games already in professional games if there becomes is a situation arises in which a
[2321.00 → 2326.84] certain meta is always being used by everybody all the time then that is an indication to the
[2326.84 → 2334.12] developers that they need to like nerf or buff something it's IMA imbalanced yeah see I'm dropping
[2334.12 → 2341.08] I used a game I know some games all you haters yeah so like I feel like that's that's a problem
[2341.08 → 2346.12] regardless of whether there's AI or not in the system you know like if everyone starts using
[2346.12 → 2353.96] one strategy that means that that game needs to change or um it's not a good game yeah yeah in
[2353.96 → 2359.56] games generally that's called the uh the size of the book so the reason that chess is a more interesting
[2359.56 → 2364.36] game than checkers is because it has a bigger book if you go to a checkers tournament and the two same
[2364.36 → 2373.32] size board though yeah if the pros in a tournament play like 42 games in a row yeah 39 of them will
[2373.32 → 2378.36] be a draw like, and they're playing the exact same game every time because there's no opportunity to
[2378.36 → 2383.56] go out of book because there's just not that many combinations of moves that make sense to make but in
[2383.56 → 2389.16] chess and go as you've heard people like to say these things like there's more chess uh combinations
[2389.16 → 2393.48] than there are atoms in the universe and stuff like that, and it's true and that makes it more
[2393.48 → 2398.36] interesting games because once you get like 100 moves into the game you can be out of book you can
[2398.36 → 2407.16] be into all new territory this is now we've we have AIs now that can go off book you know like
[2407.16 → 2412.60] that was a that was an example in chess where like one of the AI started using strategies that like no
[2412.60 → 2417.80] one had really seen before totally novel yeah so are we going to get to a point where people don't even
[2417.80 → 2425.40] want to see humans play each other in these games because it's not as interesting well because i
[2425.40 → 2429.96] wouldn't want to see like I wouldn't be interested in seeing like well maybe I would actually I was
[2429.96 → 2434.44] going to say I wouldn't be interested in seeing robot like basketball players or something but like
[2436.28 → 2441.48] I disagree that I think I would want to see that I disagree that it's less interesting and here's why
[2441.48 → 2448.20] when this quake machine plays yep okay it may be developed a really great strategy but
[2449.08 → 2455.48] how good is it at aiming it is as good as they program it to be at aiming that's a good you know
[2455.48 → 2460.12] the point of like the beauty of a perfect pro human player is that this person has awesome
[2460.12 → 2465.72] reflexes this person can just click on heads all day whereas with the machine they're just going to say
[2465.72 → 2471.64] hey you're you're like reticle is this big the probability of you getting a headshot is x and
[2471.64 → 2475.64] that's just set and that's going to have to be set between all the different machines that play each
[2475.64 → 2482.36] others see now this, so this is what the study says about the abilities of the AI versus the humans uh at
[2482.36 → 2489.80] close range the AI excelled in combat, but humans were better snipers um, but that's tweakable it is
[2489.80 → 2494.52] tweakable, but that's because its reaction time was half of that of humans and in part because its accuracy
[2494.52 → 2500.36] was 80 compared to the humans 50, but this is only in this iteration of the game they could change its
[2500.36 → 2504.52] accuracy they could change its reaction time and everything right whereas with humans you're just
[2504.52 → 2507.72] you have what you're born with or whatever stimulant you can put in your body that day
[2508.68 → 2514.52] that's what you've got right and that's why it's interesting well and this is the funny thing about
[2514.52 → 2517.32] any of this kind of like AI stuff is that like
[2520.76 → 2526.28] they're beating humans but usually the AI always has some sort of advantage like in that data 2
[2526.28 → 2533.96] when we reported on um or was it data 2 it was star craft yeah um in the star craft story when uh open AI
[2534.76 → 2540.84] uh oh no it wasn't open AI no it's that deep mine so what you're talking about is it had
[2540.84 → 2545.00] full map knowledge initially it had full map knowledge, and then they took it away, and it did
[2545.00 → 2552.12] way worse yeah um but uh okay it didn't have full map knowledge it had fog of war there were areas
[2552.12 → 2556.92] that were unexplored on the map that it could not see however it didn't have a viewport like a human
[2556.92 → 2562.44] does right who has to pan around it had vision of the whole map at once which is yeah totally not fair
[2562.44 → 2571.56] and I don't like that i, so this is why I don't think that human play is going to be less interesting
[2571.56 → 2574.44] and we're just going to watch a tournament of robots that doesn't really make any sense
[2575.48 → 2580.12] oh dude let's talk about the dual screen laptops okay
[2582.36 → 2587.08] bring it on do you have anything else to say I watched Linus's video on it no I think we pretty
[2587.08 → 2592.52] much covered if it's an interesting topic um do you know because I think that's fascinating
[2592.52 → 2597.88] because laptops have been completely stagnant in terms of design for so long intel came out and was
[2597.88 → 2604.20] like project Athena it's gonna it's just as good as Ultrabooks it's another design initiative it's
[2604.20 → 2609.64] going to be perfect, but it's like it didn't really get me excited which one was that project Athena yeah
[2609.64 → 2614.44] that's just like another kind of program that they're doing where they have a certain set of
[2614.44 → 2620.04] requirements for laptops to hit like the Ultrabook program was started by intel they're like hey
[2620.04 → 2623.96] laptops are big and chunky we want to make them thin so they now what you think of as an Ultrabook
[2623.96 → 2628.44] a really thin and light laptop that's because intel kind of made a push in the industry to get
[2628.44 → 2633.88] manufacturers to start doing that so project Athena is kind of like the same thing but in terms of
[2633.88 → 2638.84] like performance, and you know cooling capacity and that kind of stuff power efficiency I don't know
[2638.84 → 2642.52] okay I don't I haven't actually seen the requirements, but that's what I know about it so
[2642.52 → 2647.64] um that was like you know they announced it, and it was all it was almost like they were putting
[2647.64 → 2652.36] that up just to get people excited about it like to just to have something to say because AMD was
[2652.36 → 2656.36] like oh we have all these things going on and intel was like we're cool too still they're like seven
[2656.36 → 2661.72] nanometres they're like we're cool i wish people actually talk like that like you go to the
[2661.72 → 2673.24] AMD keynote they're like hey welcome to AMD keynote thank you all for coming yeah thanks for coming
[2673.24 → 2678.92] we got a lot of cool stuff to say I guess why is he talking like that what's wrong with it okay
[2679.72 → 2685.40] so um there are a few things I don't know maybe not everyone has seen this video but zen book pro duo
[2685.40 → 2690.44] oh are you're going to show us I was just going to hold up this laptop and describe what it looks
[2690.44 → 2695.16] like what's it called it's uh okay it looks like this you got a laptop right okay you keep searching
[2695.16 → 2700.76] rally I don't know what it's called oh uh honeycomb glacier is what it's what the heck that was intel's
[2700.76 → 2705.64] Asus is the screen pad pro duo yeah that just looks like this, but it's got a screen here have you not
[2705.64 → 2709.48] seen it yeah I watched the video I said no I think that's about the other one what are you talking about
[2709.48 → 2714.84] what are you talking about buddy show us here dude get us up to speed put that up put that up
[2714.84 → 2719.40] for there are things in the way oh this one with like it has hinges right yeah yeah yeah
[2719.40 → 2724.68] this is weird line of screen boom okay look at this do not allow get out of here you're not allowed
[2724.68 → 2730.12] make that bigger if you guys haven't seen this you didn't watch you this is what you reported on
[2730.12 → 2734.52] on Wednesday on tech link I know but I can't see the pictures you didn't see the pictures I just read
[2734.52 → 2740.28] the script so like when it's folded and when it's you know just in normal mode like that that's
[2740.28 → 2746.92] basically what the Asus one looks like yeah but see that little hinge there see this little doohickey
[2746.92 → 2750.92] yeah I see you can bend that and have it kind of stand-up oh, and it has like a little Microsoft
[2750.92 → 2757.00] surface type kickstand at the back it's that can support its weight yeah wow see okay if that
[2757.00 → 2761.88] ever wears out and gets loose you're screwed yeah yeah yeah maybe another hand wait another thing
[2761.88 → 2766.52] to break do you think there's a little vertically standing stick behind it like a post that's
[2766.52 → 2771.72] here maybe like I actually haven't seen it all the way around I haven't I haven't like the kickstand
[2771.72 → 2775.72] comes like this and then there's another one you slide up yeah that's a lot of moving parts yeah that
[2775.72 → 2782.92] would be bank but I think seeing this is just like you know as someone you do this too we keep on top
[2782.92 → 2789.08] of all the yeah changes in design and like iterations that people do to normal designs and this is like
[2789.08 → 2793.48] this is one of the things that I have it's one of the first things I've seen in a while that I'm
[2793.48 → 2799.56] kind of like oh that's okay yeah I don't hate it because the dual screen thing without that extra
[2799.56 → 2804.92] hinge I don't really get it because I'm like to show us that one well I guess you can imagine it basically
[2804.92 → 2810.36] doesn't stand up it looks like this it looks like that so Asus has a lap laptop that's like this but
[2810.36 → 2815.00] I mean I guess that makes sense if you're like hunching over your laptop, but that's not very ergonomic jams
[2815.00 → 2820.28] Linus said it was really cool he uh no I know used it I watched that video where he was like
[2820.28 → 2824.20] into it and I think I said on my tech link that I'm like I can't really trust him because it doesn't
[2824.20 → 2828.12] look that cool to me, I don't think it's that ergonomic because if I sit like this like I am
[2828.12 → 2832.60] now sometimes when I'm typing something complex for some reason I have to stare at the keyboard
[2832.60 → 2836.12] not because I'm looking where I'm typing just I don't know I can't look at the screen I have to just
[2836.12 → 2842.52] but what's better if I do that my neck is completely aligned and I'm looking basically at the hinge area of
[2842.52 → 2847.24] the laptop and that's where that screen is going to be unless he was talking about putting your
[2847.24 → 2853.72] document actually at the bottom and having your other tertiary little supporting screens up there
[2853.72 → 2858.84] and I can dig that but I'm just saying that like from an ergonomic perspective
[2860.04 → 2864.36] would I rather have that or would I rather have this well this is more options yeah this is it's
[2864.36 → 2870.76] both it's better the question of how much more is it going to cost probably more how much
[2871.56 → 2874.68] well I don't know they don't they this is just what would you like to pay how much more would
[2874.68 → 2879.40] you pay if they're the same except for they have that has that I don't want to pay anything 200
[2879.40 → 2881.56] I just want to have it appear
[2884.44 → 2889.64] how much would you pay for this I didn't say that I said how much more would you pay well I don't know i
[2889.64 → 2895.24] need to know what the base price point is okay so you're okay presumably these are going to be like
[2895.24 → 2902.28] two grand at least I should hope so I mean there's more screen okay I like one thing I like about
[2902.28 → 2908.12] both of these is because there's a screen above the keyboard it pushes your keyboard down closer to
[2908.12 → 2914.04] the rim of your yeah you like that a lot of people don't like that I guess you don't you lose a wrist
[2914.04 → 2919.32] rest you lose the rest and a bunch of these laptops that are coming out with these this new kind
[2919.32 → 2924.92] of push down keyboard are coming with wrist rests so then you have another thing to bring around in
[2924.92 → 2929.88] your bag you're not going to bring it around with you, you're not I'm not what if they just had a
[2929.88 → 2935.48] little thing that slides out and a very thin slides out tilts down put your wrist on there
[2937.72 → 2944.04] I don't hate the touchpad on the right I don't hate that I like that a lot of people don't like that
[2944.04 → 2949.80] but it doesn't make any sense to me because you're I mean why you want to move your hand
[2949.80 → 2953.88] further to the centre what do you mean which what are you talking about some people don't
[2953.88 → 2959.00] like the touchpad being on the right it's going like that yeah and I don't know why they don't like
[2959.00 → 2968.76] it neither do i what else we got is there anything do you think that the so we're in agreement do you
[2968.76 → 2973.88] know with this one this design that you do like with the hinge do you know if it's binary or if
[2973.88 → 2981.80] it's uh like continuous can I stand it and stop it at any point along that along the way, or it's
[2981.80 → 2989.08] either here or it's here well I haven't seen really any views of the back so they're all stills right
[2989.08 → 2994.36] have you seen a video let's go back let's see I'm going to get away from them yeah he's going to do some
[2994.36 → 3000.92] stuff here I'm going to go some I'm hacking guys and also I wonder the part that stands up that has the
[3000.92 → 3005.96] screen in it what's the internals there is it super light, and it's only screen yeah look at this look
[3005.96 → 3010.92] at it like the back of a laptop look at this one it doesn't look like there's any ram or battery or
[3010.92 → 3017.40] storage really like a kickstand I think because if you look at this one yeah those are different
[3017.40 → 3022.36] configurations yeah but I don't think there's like a like you were saying there's a piece of clear
[3022.36 → 3028.76] acrylic right there what where they're just joking holding it up there's just a square no it looks
[3028.76 → 3033.00] like that's just kind of you can do whatever you want with it this is really cool
[3033.00 → 3037.56] I saw somebody on Twitter I think saying that like eventually laptops will have like just keep
[3037.56 → 3043.32] adding screens just like go around you all the way what is this though is that chin bar or is that
[3043.32 → 3047.80] just because they're watching YouTube or something that is chin bar like that's dead space it's dead
[3047.80 → 3052.60] space because on the Asus one it looks like the screens are almost abutting each other
[3052.60 → 3061.32] there's not abutting is that like IMA is that not a word they're adjacent I'm I'm I'm not challenging
[3061.32 → 3071.72] you I'm asking you what abutting a b u and then but t d abutting no t's abetting what no
[3071.72 → 3076.28] that's a different word eating and abutting this is not the grammar show this is the like third time
[3076.28 → 3086.92] we've gotten into wordy oh man you really boil my gears sometimes jams you really grind my eggs
[3089.32 → 3094.44] what was the boil what is a budding oh my goodness let's look at a butt
[3095.80 → 3100.52] and then hit images it's one word abutting like that abut
[3100.52 → 3108.04] a butt grunt be next to or have a common boundary with well we learned something on the land show
[3108.04 → 3115.24] today don't say we say i we all did I'm saying we are okay the whole the audience except for the people
[3115.24 → 3120.04] in the audience there's no way anyone else knew what that word wasn't it's not that obscure abutting
[3120.04 → 3129.88] is a thing yep is that because the cheeks are next to each other yeah yeah it's like
[3129.88 → 3135.40] like to make it like a butt yeah to make as a butt to be butt like yes it's to be a butt
[3135.40 → 3138.84] that's the that's the etymology French origin
[3141.24 → 3144.04] how much longer do we have to do this Linus will be back next week
[3147.16 → 3151.48] yeah it's been a stressful week he's been in Taiwan doing computer stuff all week
[3151.48 → 3156.20] yeah we barely made it we're down on the wire we made it though we filmed our last video
[3156.20 → 3159.80] yeah we filmed a bunch of videos without him yeah he's going to come back and be like
[3160.76 → 3165.64] what the heck one of those videos got shot moments before this wan show it was stressful you guys
[3166.36 → 3173.16] but we did it we did it we're a group of friends who can band together to accomplish goals yeah
[3174.04 → 3179.80] it sounds like uh this is uh we're ending it sounds like just because we the way we're talking yeah
[3179.80 → 3182.92] we're just not talking about anything important what if we went for another five hours
[3182.92 → 3189.64] we could who would stop us we just kept talking like in these conclusion type tones the whole time
[3189.64 → 3193.16] and so at the end of the day I guess what's the next topic
[3193.16 → 3200.36] do you want to do one more oh super chats let's just do super chats chat fun
[3201.16 → 3205.72] hey there's one how do you get there I never do this at the bottom
[3205.72 → 3215.64] um there's a bunch just do we say the names' lewis Gomez says you love turtles hey me too buddy I like
[3215.64 → 3220.92] turtles thanks for the super chat drake Simmons is missing Ltd this year a mistake can Riley promise
[3220.92 → 3227.00] me a high five next year for missing this one he's gonna drake that's 100 my dude I will high
[3227.00 → 3232.28] five you's at a raptors game he can't come say hi this is going to be a great one you should really
[3232.28 → 3237.96] come to this one but I guess if you can't then you're gonna yeah this year is going to be awesome Ben
[3237.96 → 3243.40] Maitland I've read the original paper the AI learns to aim okay all right oh it learns to aim yeah oh so it
[3243.40 → 3250.36] just didn't get good enough yeah, thanks Ben BM says hi what's up dude love you ah it learns to aim
[3250.36 → 3257.08] but can't it just it'll just be perfect eventually because there's no disconnect like for me the
[3257.08 → 3260.68] difference between I don't want to get into this but the difference in games and sports don't get me
[3260.68 → 3266.12] started the gift difference in games and sports is that in a sport you have something in a game you
[3266.12 → 3270.84] have something you want to do, and you can just do it like in chess I want to move my knight to e4 I can
[3270.84 → 3277.56] just do that right but in football I want to throw the ball that's your hands to a grid space on the
[3277.56 → 3283.08] field and even though I want it to go there my body says nope it's not quite going there yeah and your
[3283.08 → 3287.88] mind says yes, but your body says yeah you can't always execute what you want yeah but the machine
[3287.88 → 3292.20] will always be able to execute what you want so it's its less of a sport uh I'm not
[3292.20 → 3295.88] saying esports or sports I'm not saying they're not, but there's obviously a human element where I try to
[3295.88 → 3300.68] aim somewhere and I don't click on your head even it out we need to make we need to put the AI into a robot
[3300.68 → 3306.12] body and then make it play the computer game with robot fingers yeah not that not even that you
[3306.12 → 3312.52] would need to throw in randomness well you have to be like in physical any anything in a physical
[3312.52 → 3318.04] world there's more randomness than digital I don't know haven't you seen aliens when that android takes
[3318.04 → 3325.08] the knife and goes I actually haven't seen aliens go back to the super chats bar gave choppy Karla I'm

[3430.68 → 3436.60] semi foldable screens are useless with plastic screens that's a bold statement can you back it
[3436.60 → 3438.68] up useless with plastic screens
[3441.00 → 3446.76] why did you put a screen protector on it why are they more useful I think he means they're unappealing
[3447.72 → 3448.92] surely they couldn't be more
[3448.92 → 3456.36] more functional if they were glass instead of plastic yeah I don't know man i I think that they'll
