[0.00 → 2.00] Okay.
[2.00 → 6.00] And welcome to the WAN Show, ladies and gentlemen.
[6.00 → 11.00] We've got a fantastic show for you today with no technical difficulties yet.
[11.00 → 18.00] It was intentional that we sent out a notification several minutes before we actually went live.
[18.00 → 25.00] It turns out that is how the YouTube streaming platform dashboard thing is supposed to work.
[25.00 → 32.00] It's a little ironic. We actually had a call with YouTube today where Twitch just updated their dashboard, what, a couple of weeks ago?
[32.00 → 35.00] Something like that? Yeah. And we were showing them Twitch's new dashboard.
[35.00 → 40.00] We went, wow, their new dashboard is sure a lot more new looking than your new dashboard.
[40.00 → 42.00] YouTube got the dark theme right.
[42.00 → 43.00] They did.
[43.00 → 46.00] They got the dark theme right. It's got a nice dark theme on it.
[46.00 → 53.00] Except usually when you go with like a dark theme, you don't make the white text and like icons like pure white.
[53.00 → 56.00] I don't think those are quite pure white.
[56.00 → 57.00] No? Okay.
[57.00 → 58.00] They're too white.
[58.00 → 59.00] Yes.
[59.00 → 60.00] But they aren't pure white.
[60.00 → 62.00] They look like it from here, but I have bad eyes, and it's decently far away.
[62.00 → 63.00] You do.
[63.00 → 64.00] Yeah.
[64.00 → 67.00] So anyway, guys, we got coached on the tools.
[67.00 → 73.00] Turns out it was user error, but also bad tools.
[73.00 → 88.00] So, you know, it's kind of like when the guy chops his finger off with the hedge trimmer, but the hedge trimmer had no instructions and had like a had like a, you know, the handle had the start button right on it.
[88.00 → 96.00] And there's like a thing from inside the thing that you got to pull out with your fingers and the only place to grab it is there, and you lose your finger, and you're like, well, this wasn't entirely my fault.
[96.00 → 100.00] Considering the state of the dashboard, the start button is just in the spinning part.
[100.00 → 101.00] Yeah.
[101.00 → 102.00] In there.
[102.00 → 106.00] So we've got a great show for you guys today.
[106.00 → 109.00] Microsoft unveiled the new Xbox.
[109.00 → 110.00] Oh my.
[110.00 → 116.00] Part of a proud line of Boxes with names that make absolutely no sense.
[116.00 → 120.00] The Intel Core i9 10, 9, you know what?
[120.00 → 128.00] I think in protest against Intel's naming schemes, I am going to start saying all the numbers individually.
[128.00 → 131.00] The Core i9 10, 9, 0, 0, K.
[131.00 → 133.00] I thought you were going to go with just dropping the 10.
[133.00 → 134.00] No, no, no.
[134.00 → 135.00] 900K.
[135.00 → 136.00] I'll keep the I'll keep.
[136.00 → 137.00] Start it over for them.
[137.00 → 138.00] I'll keep the 10.
[138.00 → 142.00] If they're going to make it terrible, I'm just going to take it one step further.
[142.00 → 143.00] That's all.
[143.00 → 149.00] A 10 core processor and Z490 chipset are rumoured to arrive in April 2020.
[149.00 → 150.00] What else we got?
[150.00 → 151.00] You should do the dashes.
[151.00 → 152.00] i9-10.
[152.00 → 153.00] I know.
[153.00 → 160.00] Mac Pro pricing and Facebook to use Oculus VR data for ad purposes.
[160.00 → 162.00] Because we all knew that was going to go downhill eventually.
[162.00 → 163.00] What?
[163.00 → 164.00] Shut up.
[164.00 → 168.00] Shut the barn door.
[168.00 → 169.00] The front door.
[169.00 → 170.00] That was close.
[170.00 → 172.00] Shut some door.
[172.00 → 174.00] Alright guys, intro time!
[183.00 → 204.00] I thought we were going for the triple M this time.
[204.00 → 205.00] Nope.
[205.00 → 206.00] Nope.
[206.00 → 207.00] It was worth a shot.
[207.00 → 208.00] But we didn't make it.
[208.00 → 210.00] We did not do that thing.
[210.00 → 214.70] Alright, so why don't we jump right into our headline topic?
[214.96 → 218.70] I had, oh, bloody hell, our chat is fast.
[218.80 → 219.98] What was your name again?
[220.74 → 222.12] What was your name there, buddy?
[223.86 → 225.60] Whatever, it doesn't matter.
[225.72 → 226.54] It might just be gone.
[226.80 → 228.30] Yeah, I'm over it.
[228.36 → 230.40] And they're like, is the new, oh, here it is.
[230.84 → 233.72] Alex Herring asks, is the new Xbox good?
[234.82 → 238.94] Well, let's open up that can of worms.
[238.94 → 239.34] Oh.
[239.58 → 239.96] Get it?
[240.20 → 243.12] I don't, because I don't know if what I've seen is real.
[243.48 → 244.96] It's real.
[245.44 → 246.02] It's real.
[246.20 → 250.76] Okay, so I saw a tweet from a friend of mine that works at Microsoft.
[251.08 → 251.58] Yep, yep.
[251.60 → 256.48] And I saw a picture, and he said it was a new Xbox.
[256.76 → 256.98] Yep.
[257.12 → 258.52] And I was like, there's no way.
[258.86 → 262.14] And then I expanded it to look at the comments, and the comments seemed to be shared.
[262.62 → 263.68] It is real.
[263.86 → 264.58] It is real.
[264.62 → 264.98] What?
[264.98 → 268.10] This is news.xbox.com.
[268.10 → 270.28] That is the new Xbox.
[271.32 → 271.60] Okay.
[271.60 → 272.72] Okay.
[272.72 → 272.88] Okay.
[273.38 → 278.86] So both companies just completely abandoned the traditional console design that they had established
[278.86 → 279.52] for years.
[279.66 → 283.58] I mean, in fairness to them, Nintendo's done some pretty weird stuff, too.
[283.82 → 286.72] Oh, but they never had a traditional console design.
[286.72 → 290.36] Well, they defined the traditional console design.
[290.58 → 291.92] And then immediately abandoned it.
[291.92 → 292.42] Well, no.
[292.62 → 292.78] No.
[293.14 → 293.56] NEW.
[294.18 → 294.64] SNES.
[294.74 → 295.54] Yeah, and then...
[295.54 → 296.36] N64.
[296.72 → 297.10] Ugh.
[297.10 → 298.70] Controllers on the front.
[299.20 → 300.26] Cartridge in the top.
[300.56 → 300.82] Eh?
[301.58 → 301.98] Okay.
[302.20 → 302.54] Eh?
[302.78 → 303.14] Okay.
[303.30 → 303.70] Okay.
[303.82 → 305.80] But, like, the shape of it and stuff.
[306.08 → 307.54] The Game Cube was a departure.
[307.82 → 308.82] Controllers on the front.
[310.20 → 311.06] Disc in the top.
[311.12 → 311.86] Disc in the top.
[311.90 → 312.38] Yeah, yeah.
[312.46 → 312.70] Okay.
[312.82 → 314.20] So they shared that design.
[314.20 → 321.18] But, like, they went from, like, box to box with some weird edges to box with round stuff
[321.18 → 324.04] and weird edges to, like, cube to...
[324.04 → 325.80] They just keep changing their form.
[326.16 → 329.26] Xbox and PlayStation have generally been kind of the same deal.
[329.36 → 332.38] So here's the fundamental problem that I have with that.
[332.38 → 333.38] It...
[333.38 → 336.38] Everybody...
[336.38 → 338.08] Not everybody.
[338.70 → 342.40] Most people already own their home media console.
[342.40 → 346.08] And by console, I don't mean game console.
[346.26 → 347.92] I mean, like, the cabinet.
[348.20 → 348.40] Yeah.
[348.50 → 350.78] Or, like, the thing that your TV sits on.
[350.96 → 351.18] Yep.
[351.36 → 356.32] And I've actually run into this because I'm one of the few freaks on this planet that actually
[356.32 → 357.84] has, like, an HTPC.
[358.32 → 358.52] Yeah.
[358.52 → 360.38] Like, a computer hooked up in my living room.
[360.70 → 364.06] Although I mostly use it for VR, actually, as opposed to home heatedness.
[364.98 → 366.40] HDR on Windows.
[366.56 → 367.28] Just terrible.
[367.64 → 367.90] Anyway.
[369.36 → 371.46] So I'm one of the few freaks that has one of those.
[371.46 → 377.16] And one of the biggest problems out there with having a PC hooked up to your TV is that
[377.16 → 382.40] the vast majority of these consoles are not designed to have a computer-shaped thing in
[382.40 → 382.54] them.
[382.68 → 382.74] Yeah.
[383.28 → 386.48] And Microsoft went and created a computer-shaped thing.
[386.54 → 392.30] Now, in fairness to Microsoft, the size actually looks quite deal-affable.
[392.44 → 394.38] So we've got an Xbox controller there.
[394.54 → 394.72] Yeah.
[394.72 → 398.22] And then it looks like it's about an Xbox controller wide.
[398.46 → 399.56] So it's about like that.
[400.08 → 403.02] And then it's about three Xbox controllers high.
[403.18 → 404.66] So it's about like that.
[405.50 → 408.18] That's pretty manageable, I think.
[408.18 → 411.34] But it just looks like a computer.
[411.34 → 419.12] And so naturally, it raises all the same commentary that we've been making about the Xbox and the
[419.12 → 423.56] PlayStation, for that matter, as they've become more and more PC-like.
[423.94 → 425.72] That it's just a PC.
[426.24 → 428.70] Why don't you just call it a PC at this point?
[429.06 → 429.16] Yeah.
[429.16 → 432.58] Anyway, let's go through what else.
[432.66 → 436.40] Oh, as for whether it's good, I'm sure it's fine.
[437.00 → 442.58] I mean, the dev kits that people have right now are likely just based on like multiple
[442.58 → 447.00] GPUs of whatever's current gen, because it's going to be...
[447.00 → 448.20] Oh, man.
[448.34 → 450.92] What's the new AMD?
[451.40 → 451.92] RTG?
[452.40 → 453.86] No, that's Radeon Technologies.
[453.86 → 454.98] Oh, the name.
[455.50 → 457.64] I didn't know the name until I got to the end of the trailer.
[457.94 → 458.22] No.
[459.16 → 462.46] Okay, if you can switch to my screen for a sec, too.
[462.46 → 463.40] I would love to.
[464.36 → 465.54] This part of the video.
[465.78 → 467.76] So they start the trailer video.
[467.84 → 467.98] Sorry.
[468.20 → 469.48] RDNA-based graphics.
[469.62 → 471.92] That's AMD's new architecture.
[472.72 → 473.44] Anyway, sorry, go ahead.
[473.76 → 478.48] They start the video off with like pseudo game trailer style footage, which is probably
[478.48 → 479.20] what they should have done.
[479.26 → 479.74] It makes sense.
[479.86 → 484.00] And then they transition to like, and this is the box that it's all going to be played
[484.00 → 484.66] on, right?
[484.86 → 485.08] Yeah.
[485.08 → 490.78] This part is the most like, this is a computer ad ever.
[491.46 → 493.48] And like the point that it really hits me.
[493.48 → 494.14] It just looks like a computer.
[494.14 → 494.64] Yeah.
[494.76 → 495.28] But not yet.
[495.48 → 497.72] Right here where it glows green at the top.
[497.82 → 497.98] Yeah.
[497.98 → 499.82] I'm like, that's RGB.
[499.82 → 505.28] That Corsair somehow figured out how to shove into some new like cooler.
[505.28 → 505.50] Yeah.
[505.50 → 509.68] And this is an advertisement for a cooler for an AIO for a computer.
[509.84 → 509.98] Yeah.
[510.20 → 510.66] Like this.
[510.98 → 511.66] Power your dreams.
[511.84 → 512.28] I too.
[512.38 → 516.88] I really do dream of a day when the Xbox is just a PC, and we can stop pretending.
[517.36 → 517.78] Yeah.
[517.90 → 520.14] Because honestly, that would be really cool.
[520.28 → 525.42] If an Xbox was just a really affordable PC that you hooked up in your living room that
[525.42 → 536.08] came with a controller and the actual Xbox software layer just ran on top of like a hypervisor
[536.08 → 537.22] or something like that.
[537.22 → 541.58] So that it was the kind of thing that you could actually just run on any PC and cross-platform
[541.58 → 544.22] play becomes just everywhere.
[544.48 → 544.68] Yeah.
[544.98 → 547.68] That'd be freaking sick.
[547.68 → 551.62] Because by the time it's running on, I think, what is it?
[551.66 → 552.84] Is it going to be Zen 2 Cores?
[553.10 → 554.42] You know, I'm going to have to check my notes here.
[554.50 → 556.94] But by the time it's running on, yeah, yeah.
[557.08 → 565.60] By the time it's running on AMD Zen 2 CPU Cores and, you know, DirectX 12 RDNA-based architecture
[565.60 → 572.14] GPU, unless they do another like weird thing where they use the like GDDR memory as the
[572.14 → 576.52] system RAM or something bizarre like that, which we actually did see in that weird Chinese
[576.52 → 577.00] console.
[577.00 → 578.40] And it did run Windows.
[578.60 → 578.76] Yeah.
[579.24 → 579.36] Yeah.
[579.40 → 583.50] So unless they do something weird architecturally, it's just a PC.
[583.72 → 587.36] So it'd be super cool if I could just have my PC be an Xbox.
[588.32 → 592.34] Now, I know for DRM reasons, that's going to be very difficult to do.
[592.40 → 596.74] But I mean, we live in the age of always connected DRM.
[596.80 → 601.02] It seems like the kind of thing that would be manageable through software somehow.
[601.24 → 601.50] Yeah, doable.
[601.76 → 604.44] So it's called the Xbox Series X.
[605.60 → 606.98] So why don't we walk through it?
[607.00 → 607.40] Shall we?
[607.60 → 608.74] We had the Xbox.
[609.40 → 610.40] The Xbox 360.
[611.36 → 613.32] Which was a good enough name.
[614.02 → 615.82] I had no real issue with the 360.
[616.46 → 622.14] I think that's just because you were at an age where the Xbox 360 was like an important
[622.14 → 623.68] console for you growing up.
[623.68 → 624.20] It was.
[624.28 → 625.20] I played a lot of Halo 2.
[625.20 → 627.80] Yeah, I think that's the only reason you forgive it.
[627.80 → 628.10] But at the same time.
[628.10 → 628.80] Rose coloured.
[628.80 → 629.30] Hold on.
[629.38 → 629.88] Hold on.
[629.88 → 636.64] At least there was a clear road ahead in terms of naming.
[636.64 → 640.56] I remember at the time people thought it might be like 720 or whatever.
[640.74 → 641.30] Well, no.
[641.46 → 641.78] I know.
[641.88 → 642.46] It could have.
[642.46 → 643.08] Oh, ahead from 360.
[643.08 → 643.66] From 360.
[643.66 → 646.18] Yeah, that's because they backed themselves into a corner.
[646.72 → 647.12] Ironically.
[647.50 → 650.52] You name it after a circle, you back yourself into a corner.
[650.52 → 656.24] Dude, the amount of jokes about like I'm going to do a 180 when I see the 360 and all this.
[656.52 → 658.02] There was so many.
[658.50 → 660.56] But yeah, I didn't mind it too much.
[661.06 → 664.20] It didn't make a lot of sense in its own right, but there was a clear distinction between
[664.20 → 665.12] it and the previous one.
[665.84 → 667.36] And then it just went sharply downhill.
[667.36 → 668.66] Then we went Xbox One.
[668.66 → 673.44] But like I don't think they had anywhere logical to really go because calling it a 720 would
[673.44 → 674.20] be silly too.
[674.54 → 674.92] I don't know.
[674.94 → 675.92] What do you do after that?
[676.22 → 677.06] The Xbox.
[677.06 → 686.60] Well, if you're Intel, you call it the Xbox 10,900 and 700 K S edition.
[686.60 → 687.12] Well, the.
[687.56 → 687.96] I-9.
[687.96 → 689.44] Remember, you got to do individual digits.
[689.62 → 689.96] Yeah, yeah.
[690.88 → 691.80] Yeah, but so.
[692.02 → 694.68] Yeah, so we went to Xbox One after that.
[694.90 → 698.46] Yeah, and then they were all kind of part of the same generation.
[698.66 → 701.64] One S, one X.
[702.08 → 705.94] Yeah, and then those two were actually more like the same generation, but that was like
[705.94 → 706.36] a gen.
[706.68 → 708.64] That was like a half gen, you know?
[708.68 → 709.94] And like X is a.
[710.84 → 711.90] Yeah, I don't know.
[712.02 → 713.16] They're like surprisingly.
[713.44 → 716.98] The one originally is surprisingly different from the one X.
[717.12 → 718.24] Yeah, and the S is more of just like a.
[718.24 → 719.30] They're actually kind of different beast.
[719.38 → 723.46] Like a die shrunk newish, but then has a Blu-ray drive.
[723.72 → 725.02] So it's like that's pretty sweet.
[725.02 → 726.66] It's like a decent amount of differentiation.
[726.66 → 730.32] More than what I would normally expect from like, oh, you get the PlayStation, then you
[730.32 → 731.18] get the PlayStation Slim.
[731.52 → 732.12] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[732.12 → 733.70] Like it's a little bit different from that.
[735.40 → 738.28] So, and now we have the Series X.
[738.52 → 739.88] Which is like, okay.
[740.10 → 742.20] So here is my thought on that.
[742.20 → 746.30] And I actually don't know.
[746.38 → 747.04] Oh yeah, here we go.
[747.10 → 748.18] So here's my thought on that.
[748.46 → 751.14] Is it comes down to this backwards compatible messaging.
[751.36 → 752.10] So this is a quote.
[752.64 → 756.76] You can expect your gaming legacy, thousands of your favourite games across four generations
[756.76 → 762.28] of gaming, all your Xbox One gaming accessories and services like Xbox Game Pass to be available
[762.28 → 765.76] when you power on your Xbox Series X in holiday 2020.
[765.98 → 766.84] It's cool the controllers work.
[766.84 → 774.66] So that's why they're calling it Xbox Series X because they are acknowledging that architecturally
[774.66 → 776.42] they are the same damn thing.
[776.66 → 783.38] So there is no reason whatsoever to not just run those older games on the new one rather
[783.38 → 785.80] than locking down backwards and forwards compatibility.
[785.98 → 788.54] So this is like Overwatch 2 hardware edition.
[788.54 → 790.54] Yeah.
[790.54 → 793.06] Like you can do kind of the same thing sort of.
[793.18 → 794.02] Left 4 Dead 2.
[794.40 → 794.68] Yeah.
[794.82 → 795.94] New console edition.
[796.32 → 797.12] Don't worry.
[797.26 → 801.10] We got all the same maps, all the same characters, all the same guns.
[801.28 → 803.70] There's just more maps than characters and guns.
[803.84 → 804.06] Yeah.
[804.44 → 806.54] And it runs, well, whatever.
[807.00 → 807.86] Don't worry about it.
[807.86 → 808.42] It runs better.
[809.24 → 814.70] So this has the potential to be incredibly game changing.
[814.70 → 815.52] Oh.
[816.04 → 816.78] Hey-o.
[817.02 → 820.20] In that the game doesn't change because it's the same, you could play the same game.
[820.34 → 820.56] Right.
[820.64 → 820.78] Okay.
[820.86 → 821.22] Doesn't matter.
[821.40 → 821.54] Yeah.
[821.84 → 825.36] So let's talk about the performance that people, oh, actually, hold on.
[825.40 → 826.34] Let's walk through the look first.
[826.42 → 828.70] So it basically looks like a Corsair One.
[828.90 → 832.92] I was going to say, one of the reasons why I called out Corsair was it looks like a Corsair
[832.92 → 833.16] One.
[833.34 → 835.58] Supports vertical and horizontal orientation.
[835.80 → 840.88] But looking at it, I think it's pretty obvious that you, you're an idiot if you put it on the
[840.88 → 841.16] side.
[841.22 → 842.40] Isn't the logo going to be wrong?
[842.44 → 843.94] You have a logo going the wrong way.
[843.94 → 845.04] Unless, okay.
[845.36 → 845.54] Okay.
[846.10 → 847.70] Phil, if you're watching, okay.
[848.04 → 848.66] Here's an idea.
[849.02 → 849.70] Free of charge.
[850.18 → 850.96] Magnetic logo.
[851.46 → 851.68] Okay.
[852.18 → 853.14] It's been done before.
[853.28 → 853.44] Yeah.
[854.32 → 856.82] But PCs have been made before, too.
[857.00 → 857.14] Yeah.
[857.28 → 858.12] I know, right?
[858.48 → 858.92] Okay.
[859.02 → 860.22] So it exhausts heat out the top.
[860.30 → 861.18] There's a green light visible.
[862.04 → 863.20] Would love it if it's RGB.
[863.36 → 863.90] I doubt it.
[864.06 → 864.56] I doubt it.
[864.62 → 865.78] It's almost certainly just green.
[865.92 → 866.08] Yep.
[867.16 → 868.20] About as wide as a controller.
[868.40 → 869.06] Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[869.18 → 869.86] Has a disk drive.
[869.92 → 873.92] Has a disk drive, but is ready for Microsoft's streaming service.
[873.94 → 880.34] And whether you guys like it or not, whether the hardcore like it or not, streaming is
[880.34 → 883.18] absolutely the way forward for gaming.
[883.64 → 888.60] Not the way better, the way forward.
[888.60 → 891.46] Because that's just how it's going to be.
[891.60 → 893.96] And I think we've talked about this on the WAN show before.
[894.16 → 900.82] There are going to be game experiences that would have been impossible if you had to synchronize
[900.82 → 905.18] all the data between the multiple players from remote clients.
[905.18 → 914.22] So game environments that all run within the data centre with only the inputs and the display
[914.22 → 917.30] signalling actually going out to the remote clients.
[917.30 → 923.70] Like the size of, like imagine this from a developer perspective, the size of a giant world that you
[923.70 → 931.22] could build with everything connected via fibre optic from within a data centre running on this
[931.22 → 937.78] gigantic cluster compared to what you can do with sort of discrete servers and people removing
[937.78 → 938.30] into it.
[938.46 → 941.52] To be absolutely clear, this is not me saying that it won't happen.
[941.92 → 945.96] I think it will take an extreme amount of time before we get there.
[946.08 → 946.48] Absolutely.
[947.10 → 947.58] Absolutely.
[947.92 → 952.26] Because it's not only is the entire industry going to have to accept this and that's going
[952.26 → 953.66] to take a while.
[953.78 → 955.86] It's going to change game development fundamentally.
[956.08 → 958.70] And then people are going to have to figure out how to even do that.
[958.84 → 959.18] Absolutely.
[959.18 → 960.40] Because that's going to be a completely different.
[960.40 → 965.24] But you always follow the scent of the money.
[966.14 → 966.40] Oh, yeah.
[966.50 → 967.52] No, it's, yeah.
[967.70 → 972.64] And the money, so much like Netflix, I don't think anybody saw, you know, back when Netflix
[972.64 → 974.66] was just doing like DVD rentals through the mail.
[975.02 → 975.64] Blockbuster sure didn't.
[975.68 → 977.10] I don't think anybody, yeah.
[978.22 → 982.70] It's actually a fascinating story because it's not just that they just buried Blockbuster.
[983.18 → 987.06] It's that they tried to sell themselves to Blockbuster and Blockbuster said no.
[987.06 → 990.34] You should like to look up the whole, the history of Netflix and Blockbuster.
[990.50 → 991.44] It's very interesting.
[991.44 → 998.12] So I don't think anybody saw Netflix coming as a creator of like iconic, like the new
[998.12 → 999.20] Martin Scorsese film.
[999.62 → 1002.90] Like truly flagship grade content.
[1003.46 → 1004.18] Wait, sorry, what?
[1004.48 → 1006.52] Like Netflix is like making this stuff?
[1006.66 → 1007.96] They're backing this stuff?
[1008.18 → 1009.10] They have the money for that?
[1009.70 → 1013.26] Anyone who has the money is going to try to create exclusive experiences.
[1013.38 → 1019.42] So as soon as you've got people subscribing to these streaming services, just playing traditional
[1019.42 → 1025.50] games that could have just as easily been played with a disc and a drive or a file downloaded
[1025.50 → 1027.42] to an SSD or whatever the case may be.
[1027.46 → 1031.70] As soon as that happens, you've got that recurring revenue, and they're going to try and find a
[1031.70 → 1033.40] way to hold on to that recurring revenue.
[1033.52 → 1036.26] And the way to do it is to create unique experiences.
[1036.58 → 1040.02] Speaking of unique experiences, there's a super cool VR thing that's coming to Vancouver.
[1040.14 → 1040.96] We've got to talk about it later.
[1041.02 → 1041.66] We've got to go play.
[1041.80 → 1042.48] Have you heard about it?
[1042.56 → 1042.76] No.
[1042.76 → 1043.16] Okay.
[1043.28 → 1043.84] It's room scale.
[1044.04 → 1044.40] It's dope.
[1044.54 → 1044.72] Oh.
[1044.88 → 1045.62] Looks dope anyway.
[1045.76 → 1046.04] Nice.
[1046.20 → 1047.00] Talk about it later.
[1047.20 → 1047.40] Okay.
[1048.68 → 1053.34] For now though, playing games locally, you'll have four times the processing power of the
[1053.34 → 1056.30] Xbox One X in the most quiet and efficient way.
[1057.28 → 1062.24] They're expecting 4K at 60 FPS with the possibility of up to 120 FPS.
[1062.58 → 1066.70] A lot of people get confused, I think, when they see console specs.
[1066.70 → 1074.20] Like, they'll see them say things like HDMI 2.1 up to 8K and then things like up to 120
[1074.20 → 1074.54] FPS.
[1075.40 → 1078.30] Nobody's talking about 120 FPS at 8K.
[1079.90 → 1081.34] That's either or.
[1081.72 → 1087.92] That's like this one, but not this, or this, but not this, to be very, very clear.
[1088.22 → 1093.32] I think some games could run at 4K, 120 FPS, but we're talking about...
[1093.32 → 1097.36] If you play Snake, you could probably do 8K 120.
[1097.76 → 1098.90] Well, okay.
[1100.90 → 1106.78] We're talking about developers ultimately deciding how they want the game to be experienced on
[1106.78 → 1112.42] the Xbox, and then just putting all those toggles in the PC version.
[1112.72 → 1112.92] Yeah.
[1113.06 → 1114.74] Yeah, and you can just decide how you want to play it.
[1115.06 → 1119.64] By the way, PC people, I know sometimes people get all stinky when a new console comes out
[1119.64 → 1125.74] and the PC versus console war kind of pops back up and whatnot.
[1126.10 → 1130.70] I just want everyone to remember, whenever new consoles come out, the quality of PC games
[1130.70 → 1131.64] tend to go up.
[1131.68 → 1131.82] Yep.
[1132.06 → 1136.30] And remember, we're all on the same team now because the Xbox is just a locked down PC.
[1136.68 → 1136.82] Yep.
[1137.44 → 1139.58] It's just a bunch of people buying pre-made.
[1139.72 → 1140.00] Yep.
[1140.18 → 1141.50] That's basically it.
[1141.50 → 1142.94] All right.
[1143.04 → 1149.38] So custom-designed Zen 2 AMD CPU, hardware-accelerated ray tracing, although we mostly knew that
[1149.38 → 1151.76] was coming on AMD's upcoming products.
[1151.88 → 1152.02] Yeah.
[1152.16 → 1157.42] Support for variable refresh rate, although the Xbox already had that in the form of Free Sync,
[1157.54 → 1162.28] which a lot of people think Free Sync is like this open standard that AMD developed and
[1162.28 → 1162.68] is open.
[1162.76 → 1163.30] It's not open.
[1163.30 → 1170.94] So Free Sync is AMD's branding for the adaptive sync open standard on DisplayPort.
[1171.36 → 1171.46] Yeah.
[1171.60 → 1177.24] AMD's implementation of adaptive sync on HDMI is proprietary.
[1178.58 → 1180.12] So actually...
[1180.12 → 1181.22] I actually was not aware of that.
[1181.22 → 1186.68] When a TV supports Free Sync, I guarantee it's over HDMI because TVs don't have DisplayPort
[1186.68 → 1186.98] ports.
[1186.98 → 1195.26] So when a TV supports Free Sync, it's actually like kind of bastardizing the HDMI input to
[1195.26 → 1199.70] accept this proprietary protocol that AMD has actually developed.
[1200.86 → 1201.34] Interesting.
[1201.42 → 1201.94] So now you know.
[1202.08 → 1202.26] Yeah.
[1202.34 → 1202.48] Yeah.
[1202.48 → 1207.56] So that's why it took NVIDIA so long to support variable refresh rate on TVs.
[1207.76 → 1211.94] One, I think they were kind of doing their own thing with the whole BFGD thing and the
[1211.94 → 1212.90] G-Sync modules.
[1213.06 → 1214.84] So that's definitely one side of it.
[1214.86 → 1216.04] How well do you think that's done for them?
[1216.12 → 1216.86] Sorry to derail you.
[1216.98 → 1217.26] Right now.
[1217.36 → 1218.12] I think overall...
[1218.12 → 1218.84] For BFGDs.
[1218.86 → 1220.72] ... G-Sync has been spectacular.
[1220.94 → 1221.68] Oh, BFGDs?
[1221.72 → 1222.12] Terrible.
[1222.42 → 1222.62] Yeah.
[1222.86 → 1223.40] I thought so.
[1223.48 → 1224.62] The timing was terrible.
[1224.88 → 1231.88] If they had actually launched BFGDs, so that's NVIDIA 65-inch, like, thousand-net peak
[1231.88 → 1237.04] brightness, HDR, 144Hz 4K gaming display, super cool technology.
[1237.24 → 1240.12] If they had actually launched that thing...
[1240.12 → 1241.16] Around these?
[1241.26 → 1242.06] When they...
[1242.06 → 1243.18] Not even that.
[1243.30 → 1244.30] Like, when they announced it.
[1244.66 → 1245.04] Oh, okay.
[1245.04 → 1246.12] If that had been a launch...
[1246.12 → 1248.34] Guys, it's going to be on the shelf next month.
[1248.64 → 1253.18] They would have sold a ton of them because the TV industry was still sitting on its butt,
[1253.70 → 1258.26] you know, trying to figure out having decent input LED, let alone, you know, high refresh
[1258.26 → 1259.14] rates at 4K.
[1259.36 → 1259.52] Yeah.
[1259.52 → 1265.88] But now that HDMI 2.1 is being rolled out into, like, TVs that you can buy on the shelf for
[1265.88 → 1267.58] two grand right now...
[1267.58 → 1271.20] That's rough.
[1271.44 → 1272.98] Especially, especially, man.
[1272.98 → 1276.56] The LG Olds that support G-Sync.
[1276.56 → 1278.98] They do up to 4K 120Hz.
[1280.30 → 1284.44] G-Sync down to, I believe it's 40Hz is the minimum of the refresh window.
[1284.54 → 1287.12] So technically, a BFGD will go lower.
[1287.94 → 1288.00] Okay.
[1288.00 → 1290.34] And G-Sync will still function all the way down to zero.
[1290.44 → 1292.00] It'll, like, interpolate frames and stuff.
[1292.08 → 1294.06] Like, the module does have a function.
[1294.86 → 1299.70] But as long as you've got a decent computer hooked up to it, and you're, like, somewhat
[1299.70 → 1301.08] optimizing your in-game settings...
[1301.08 → 1304.80] If you're spending that much on a screen, you should probably be able to run over 40 FPS.
[1305.08 → 1305.48] Exactly.
[1307.00 → 1309.16] The OLED experience...
[1309.16 → 1311.26] So good.
[1311.36 → 1311.68] So good.
[1311.68 → 1312.64] I've got a video coming.
[1313.24 → 1314.52] Pun definitely intended.
[1315.32 → 1317.86] I replaced the BFGD in my living room.
[1317.98 → 1320.20] Talk about the experience of going OLED with G-Sync.
[1320.34 → 1322.04] It's freaking awesome.
[1322.24 → 1322.78] Spoiler alert.
[1323.40 → 1324.02] Love it.
[1324.94 → 1326.04] One thing to tie in...
[1326.04 → 1328.68] So I'm going to jump back and derail us temporarily again.
[1329.46 → 1333.36] But Amazon, you know, they have that new Lord of the Rings show coming out.
[1334.08 → 1337.10] They're spending, like, a billion dollars on it or whatever.
[1337.74 → 1342.12] This MMO was announced a while ago, but very recently...
[1342.12 → 1343.42] I'm flipping over to your screen.
[1343.66 → 1347.32] Very recently, as of July, I guess, but I didn't hear about this.
[1347.66 → 1351.04] It's being set up by Amazon Game Studios.
[1351.62 → 1354.28] Amazon is making a new Lord of the Rings free-to-play MMO.
[1355.36 → 1355.80] Hmm.
[1357.02 → 1360.82] Amazon's, I think, more directly jumping into the gaming scene with this.
[1361.34 → 1361.74] Interesting.
[1361.74 → 1366.72] So I think Amazon Game Studios has, like, done some stuff before, but I don't know how much of it really mattered.
[1366.72 → 1374.12] And if they're bankrolling the TV show with a billion dollars, they're probably going to bankroll the game with quite a bit as well.
[1374.24 → 1376.74] I don't know exactly how much, but, like, damn.
[1376.74 → 1379.84] I think they're really trying to capitalize on the name.
[1379.96 → 1380.70] We can go back now.
[1381.44 → 1381.92] All right.
[1382.00 → 1382.20] Cool.
[1382.28 → 1383.78] So this is a really neat feature.
[1385.00 → 1393.50] The Xbox, aside from having automatic low latency mode where it tells the TV, hey, hey, you, switch over to game mode so that the latency doesn't suck.
[1393.50 → 1403.20] Because even on the latest Olds, it goes from in the neighbourhood of 100 milliseconds, which is freaking brutal, down to 12 in game mode.
[1403.40 → 1403.46] Yeah.
[1403.66 → 1404.52] That's really not bad.
[1404.62 → 1405.40] 12 is incredible.
[1405.56 → 1406.38] That's at 60 hertz.
[1406.96 → 1407.14] Yeah.
[1407.14 → 1413.38] So they're actually doing that by, I forget, it's, like, it's a different input buffering mode.
[1413.58 → 1414.72] So it's not a full frame.
[1415.10 → 1416.88] It's, like, line-based or something.
[1417.00 → 1419.62] So they actually have it down to less than one frame.
[1419.76 → 1420.38] Oh, that's crazy.
[1420.56 → 1421.36] It's really cool.
[1421.36 → 1427.24] But in addition to that, they've got this latency improvement thing.
[1427.30 → 1437.12] Ah, dynamic latency input, which will actually make the player's inputs synchronize with the rendering chain so that it's going in at the most timely possible.
[1437.14 → 1437.74] Cool.
[1438.38 → 1440.12] Which is sick.
[1440.30 → 1441.14] That's actually pretty sweet.
[1441.32 → 1443.62] I mean, you're still on, like, a wireless controller, so.
[1444.26 → 1446.72] Uh, depends on how well they do the wireless.
[1447.34 → 1448.38] Yeah, but.
[1448.74 → 1451.36] I don't know how well they're doing it, but, you know.
[1451.46 → 1453.88] Don't quote me on this, but I thought the Xbox One was Bluetooth.
[1455.04 → 1455.92] I don't think it was.
[1456.34 → 1457.26] I think it can be.
[1457.40 → 1458.86] I think that's where I'm getting confused.
[1459.08 → 1460.84] I believe it can be either Bluetooth or another one.
[1460.90 → 1462.70] Correct me in the chat if I'm wrong, though, guys.
[1463.36 → 1464.16] Um, all right.
[1464.24 → 1467.12] At the very least, it had something else going on, or it was, like, a customer.
[1467.14 → 1469.94] I think it was some implementation or something, but I remember something weird going on there.
[1470.06 → 1473.78] Uh, it's going to have an SSD to, quote, unquote, virtually eliminate load times.
[1473.92 → 1474.54] Thank goodness.
[1474.84 → 1476.20] This thing actually sounds kind of awesome.
[1476.74 → 1481.40] Variable rate shading, which is super sick, so that's part of the way that they're going
[1481.40 → 1483.90] to be able to game at 4K, like, reasonably.
[1483.90 → 1486.78] Um, or maybe even, you know, who knows?
[1486.82 → 1488.18] Maybe 8K, 60?
[1488.38 → 1489.22] Hmm, that'd be tough.
[1489.50 → 1491.06] Anyway, that's how they're going to game at 4K.
[1491.18 → 1495.68] That's how they're going to hit these, like, super high 120 FPS frame rates, um, because
[1495.68 → 1500.96] variable rate shading allows you to shade certain parts of the scene much more accurately than
[1500.96 → 1505.42] others and save GPU resources for parts that, like, the viewer wasn't going to look at anyway.
[1506.10 → 1509.00] Um, we have actually, uh, Fast as Possible about that.
[1509.68 → 1515.28] There's a new controller which has some new stuff, but, uh, I think the Xbox controllers
[1515.28 → 1520.50] probably changed, like, uh, the least out of most of them, other than maybe PlayStation.
[1520.50 → 1524.60] Um, so basically just Nintendo keeps sticking around with it.
[1524.60 → 1525.18] Yeah, yeah.
[1525.28 → 1527.76] But there's this, it's not going to be hugely different.
[1528.00 → 1528.56] Nintendo!
[1529.00 → 1531.40] The analog stick, there's an analog, it's in the middle!
[1531.92 → 1534.44] Now there's two, they're here and here.
[1534.62 → 1536.70] Oh, now you wiggle it around like this.
[1536.76 → 1537.98] Wait, now you hold the controller.
[1538.08 → 1539.24] What are you guys doing?
[1539.78 → 1541.38] There's no stick when you move it around.
[1541.82 → 1545.14] Um, yeah, so, but I don't think it's going to be that different.
[1545.14 → 1547.48] Your previous controllers are also still going to work.
[1547.92 → 1550.48] Um, you'll probably get one with them.
[1550.56 → 1553.62] The new Xbox PC, whatever.
[1554.16 → 1557.00] Um, Xbox Series X, I think it's called.
[1557.42 → 1560.38] Uh, but, like, yeah, all your old controllers will still work.
[1560.44 → 1561.56] I think that's a pretty cool move.
[1561.78 → 1565.98] A lot of the time when consoles come out, they make money off of stuff like the accessories.
[1566.30 → 1570.34] So letting you use your old controllers is, like, pretty cool, actually.
[1570.42 → 1571.92] Uh, yeah, they have Bluetooth and radio.
[1572.16 → 1575.02] So they use radio when available and Bluetooth if you don't have it.
[1575.02 → 1575.86] So, yeah, it should be fine.
[1575.98 → 1576.36] It should be fine.
[1577.40 → 1578.62] Um, all right.
[1578.92 → 1579.12] Um.
[1579.12 → 1579.76] New processors?
[1580.94 → 1583.48] Yeah, we kind of, oh, yeah, I guess, yeah, we should move.
[1583.56 → 1585.30] Wow, we've talked about this for a long time.
[1585.38 → 1587.30] We've been live for 26 minutes, ladies and gentlemen.
[1587.42 → 1589.06] Yeah, so let's talk about the new Intel.
[1589.06 → 1596.94] C-O-R-E space I9-10900K space 10-C-O-R-E.
[1597.08 → 1598.14] Hold on, hold on.
[1598.26 → 1598.58] Sorry.
[1598.86 → 1604.42] Nick really would like us to talk about something very important, very near to your heart.
[1604.52 → 1604.72] Oh.
[1605.16 → 1605.68] Right here.
[1605.78 → 1605.98] Oh.
[1605.98 → 1606.86] This shirt.
[1606.86 → 1607.40] Oh.
[1607.40 → 1607.42] Oh.
[1607.54 → 1608.66] That's what you're here for, right?
[1608.74 → 1608.90] Of course.
[1608.90 → 1609.90] So this, guys.
[1609.90 → 1610.20] Yeah.
[1610.20 → 1613.64] This is the Beta Squadron shirt.
[1613.64 → 1616.12] It's a little bit different from our previous ones.
[1616.12 → 1621.26] Guys, the fit's going to be a little bit different because it's a 100% cotton shirt, unlike the
[1621.26 → 1623.56] tri-band ones that we normally do.
[1624.36 → 1624.80] Poly-blend.
[1624.80 → 1625.20] Excuse me.
[1625.28 → 1625.40] Sorry.
[1625.48 → 1626.80] Poly-blend ones we normally do.
[1627.24 → 1629.58] So that means that it's fitting a little loose right now.
[1629.86 → 1632.78] It will shrink a little bit because it's 100% cotton.
[1633.26 → 1638.72] The graphic is a combination of the LTC logo and the float plane logo.
[1639.22 → 1641.62] And then this Beta Squadron thing we thought was funny.
[1641.82 → 1642.02] Yeah.
[1642.16 → 1644.68] Because float plane is officially going into beta.
[1645.14 → 1647.16] When does the video announcement go up?
[1647.38 → 1648.24] Don't tell Apple.
[1649.66 → 1651.08] But other than that, yes.
[1651.26 → 1651.40] Yeah.
[1651.40 → 1651.88] Absolutely.
[1652.04 → 1653.82] Video's going up on Sunday night?
[1653.96 → 1654.94] Yeah, something like that.
[1654.98 → 1655.44] I think Sunday night.
[1655.44 → 1660.02] So this is going to be like a commemorative shirt we're going to be selling on the LTT store.
[1660.44 → 1661.48] It's limited edition.
[1661.64 → 1662.66] Once they're gone, they're gone.
[1662.74 → 1663.98] We're not going to print more of these.
[1665.00 → 1667.76] But yeah, it's super bold.
[1668.46 → 1670.82] Luke was saying he thought it was just like a little thing up here.
[1670.88 → 1671.68] I was like, no.
[1671.90 → 1672.90] It's like, beta.
[1673.06 → 1673.66] Baath!
[1673.72 → 1674.68] Beta Squadron.
[1675.44 → 1678.78] So it's a play on float plane officially entering beta.
[1679.30 → 1679.48] Yeah.
[1679.70 → 1683.76] And also just, you know, beta.
[1683.96 → 1684.48] Beta is kind of cool.
[1684.64 → 1685.04] It's a funny word.
[1685.20 → 1685.36] Yeah.
[1685.76 → 1690.56] We're going to, I'm going to have to try to scoop some for like my employee people.
[1691.02 → 1691.70] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1691.70 → 1693.12] Before they potentially disappear.
[1693.30 → 1693.66] That's fine.
[1693.70 → 1694.26] Don't worry about it.
[1694.40 → 1694.56] Yeah.
[1694.78 → 1694.98] Yeah.
[1695.10 → 1696.74] It's really limited quantities too.
[1697.04 → 1698.34] Limited time, limited quantities.
[1698.56 → 1698.76] Yep.
[1699.06 → 1700.26] And it's sold as pre-sale.
[1700.26 → 1705.40] So they'll print next week, ship next week slash the week after.
[1706.44 → 1706.72] Okay.
[1706.72 → 1707.48] All right.
[1707.48 → 1711.44] And then also you wanted to run a promo last week, but you forgot to talk about it.
[1711.44 → 1712.40] You want to just run it this week?
[1712.40 → 1712.82] Mm-hmm.
[1713.90 → 1714.30] Sure.
[1714.46 → 1714.70] Yeah.
[1714.70 → 1715.78] Why don't we do a promo on the store?
[1715.86 → 1716.36] What was it again?
[1716.36 → 1719.24] I don't remember.
[1719.24 → 1720.94] It's buy one, get one hardware shirts.
[1721.10 → 1721.46] Oh, yeah.
[1721.54 → 1722.84] Buy one, get one hardware shirts.
[1722.98 → 1723.50] Oh, wow.
[1723.58 → 1724.32] Buy one, get one half.
[1724.50 → 1724.64] Yeah.
[1724.64 → 1724.82] Oh.
[1725.64 → 1726.02] Yeah.
[1726.02 → 1727.36] Buy one, get one 50% off.
[1727.56 → 1727.90] Thank you.
[1727.96 → 1729.02] Glad we clarified that.
[1729.06 → 1729.58] What's the code?
[1729.58 → 1730.80] Oh, they just add two.
[1731.20 → 1733.32] So add any two hardware shirts.
[1733.44 → 1737.68] So it's like the CPU design, RAM design, GPU, fan.
[1737.68 → 1738.82] Those are awesome shirts.
[1740.16 → 1744.18] And these are the normal ones that are on the poly blend.
[1744.80 → 1744.94] Yeah.
[1745.32 → 1747.08] Did you mean LTTstore.com?
[1747.08 → 1747.22] Holy cow.
[1747.34 → 1748.16] These are already up.
[1748.28 → 1749.20] You better believe I did.
[1749.28 → 1750.48] Those pictures were up really quick.
[1750.52 → 1750.70] Wait.
[1750.84 → 1752.80] What is I Love Toy Trains Country Store?
[1753.42 → 1753.62] What?
[1754.62 → 1755.76] ILTTstore.com.
[1755.86 → 1756.22] No, no.
[1756.30 → 1756.92] Not that one.
[1758.08 → 1759.08] What the hell?
[1759.08 → 1760.42] I'm already on the store.
[1760.42 → 1761.14] Hold on.
[1761.52 → 1764.90] No, we're going to this store right now.
[1765.66 → 1766.14] Wow.
[1767.88 → 1768.64] Click here, Debris.
[1768.86 → 1769.46] Click here.
[1769.54 → 1770.10] Click here.
[1770.30 → 1771.22] Brand reopening.
[1772.46 → 1773.44] Look at this kid.
[1773.64 → 1774.74] He's having a good time.
[1775.62 → 1777.00] This is hilarious.
[1778.02 → 1779.74] How old is this site?
[1780.20 → 1784.12] I love how it's like super out of the very, very old internet.
[1784.30 → 1786.60] It's not even like a secure site.
[1786.86 → 1787.12] Yeah.
[1787.12 → 1788.12] And then there's YouTube links.
[1788.12 → 1790.88] So it's clearly not like the, oh.
[1790.92 → 1791.26] Oh.
[1791.68 → 1792.56] Oh boy.
[1794.24 → 1796.62] I, I love Toy Trains store.
[1796.72 → 1797.44] Michigan City.
[1797.60 → 1799.16] 60 miles east of Chicago.
[1799.40 → 1801.20] And just minutes off I-94.
[1803.78 → 1807.92] Studio where the popular I Love Toy Trains series is filmed.
[1807.92 → 1810.14] All right.
[1810.14 → 1810.58] Sorry.
[1810.58 → 1810.92] Sorry.
[1810.92 → 1811.88] We'll get back.
[1811.88 → 1812.94] That was a 2019 video.
[1813.14 → 1814.50] These are, he's on this.
[1815.22 → 1815.58] All right.
[1815.58 → 1815.92] Anyway.
[1816.38 → 1817.60] So here's the float plane.
[1817.60 → 1819.08] I think they need to switch it to this one.
[1819.14 → 1819.76] LTT beta.
[1819.82 → 1819.98] Yeah.
[1819.98 → 1820.96] I like this one better too.
[1821.12 → 1823.74] Can we make this one the default picture?
[1824.00 → 1824.36] Sure.
[1824.36 → 1824.68] Yeah.
[1824.68 → 1825.18] All right.
[1825.72 → 1827.04] Beta Squadron shirt.
[1827.84 → 1828.80] There's this guy.
[1829.58 → 1830.16] So yeah.
[1830.22 → 1831.14] Any of the hardware shirts.
[1831.32 → 1833.74] Processor, GPU, hard drive.
[1833.90 → 1834.86] I really like the hard drive one.
[1834.92 → 1836.32] Fan, RAM.
[1836.32 → 1838.98] If you were a fan, which two would you get?
[1840.88 → 1846.54] I'm just going to say my personal favourites are GPU, CPU, and hard drive.
[1846.98 → 1847.90] Oh, RAM's perfect too.
[1848.16 → 1848.80] I actually-
[1848.80 → 1850.12] So you'd just buy four.
[1850.44 → 1850.74] Yeah.
[1851.04 → 1851.60] Yeah.
[1852.48 → 1853.10] Problem solved.
[1853.10 → 1854.26] Buy three, get one free.
[1854.34 → 1854.48] Wait.
[1854.54 → 1856.08] Can they apply the promo code twice?
[1856.86 → 1858.00] I doubt that works.
[1858.44 → 1860.60] I don't think it's limited to one use per customer.
[1860.84 → 1861.14] Okay.
[1861.26 → 1861.54] Well, I have no idea.
[1861.54 → 1862.52] So you just do two carts.
[1862.74 → 1864.78] You can check it out right now if you add four to your-
[1864.78 → 1864.96] Yeah.
[1864.96 → 1865.42] You could try.
[1865.46 → 1865.98] No, it's fine.
[1865.98 → 1868.16] Those guys can figure it out.
[1868.16 → 1868.44] They can figure it out.
[1868.64 → 1869.06] All right.
[1869.20 → 1872.62] So why don't we jump into the Core i9-
[1872.62 → 1873.10] Processor.
[1873.46 → 1876.64] The Core i9-10900K.
[1877.18 → 1877.58] Solid.
[1878.02 → 1878.50] So-
[1878.50 → 1882.80] You know, this will help because it will extend the video times of any reviews anyone does about this.
[1882.86 → 1886.66] Am I really going to have to say this out loud?
[1886.74 → 1889.16] This was posted on the forum by Olympic Ass Eater.
[1890.82 → 1893.68] The original article is from techpowerup.com.
[1893.68 → 1903.42] Intel is expected to refresh its mainstream desktop platform with more 14 nanometers.
[1904.74 → 1905.14] Hooray.
[1905.14 → 1906.84] Want to do the 14 nanometre dance?
[1906.98 → 1907.44] Yeah.
[1908.00 → 1908.20] Woo!
[1908.86 → 1909.94] 14 nanometre!
[1910.36 → 1910.60] Woo!
[1910.60 → 1918.74] We should throw them a party for their age, and it's like how long they've been on that process.
[1918.74 → 1920.80] Yeah, it's like third, fourth birthday or whatever.
[1921.66 → 1923.70] Core i3, four core, eight thread.
[1923.82 → 1924.04] Wow.
[1924.20 → 1927.06] Core i's are going to be four core, eight thread.
[1927.06 → 1935.18] So within one process node, Intel is going to go from selling four core, eight threads as top tier to bargain-basement.
[1935.94 → 1938.00] Core i's will be six core, 12 thread.
[1938.10 → 1939.64] Wow, i's are getting hyper-threading.
[1940.22 → 1944.94] i's will be eight core, 16 thread and the i9-10900K.
[1945.08 → 1946.48] 10 core, 20 thread.
[1946.58 → 1947.96] We're also going to get a new socket.
[1947.96 → 1951.82] So we're doing away with 11, five something.
[1952.10 → 1954.56] We get 1,200 full pins now.
[1954.58 → 1955.30] Just flat.
[1955.48 → 1958.12] And a 400 series chipset series.
[1958.58 → 1963.94] A series of 400 something chipsets led by the Z490 Express at the top.
[1964.64 → 1967.42] It's been a while since they've called a chipset something express.
[1968.48 → 1968.82] Yes.
[1968.94 → 1970.96] I feel like that was like...
[1970.96 → 1972.48] A long time ago?
[1972.48 → 1974.14] When's the last time Intel had an express chipset?
[1974.14 → 1977.18] Not like 775, 478 days?
[1977.96 → 1982.60] Intel Express.
[1983.78 → 1985.14] G41?
[1986.76 → 1990.56] Yeah, like QS67 Express chipset.
[1990.62 → 1992.58] Okay, so not quite as old as I thought it was.
[1994.38 → 1994.72] Huh.
[1994.90 → 2001.52] That is like super, super weird branding for them to bring up again for no apparent reason.
[2002.24 → 2002.66] Yep.
[2004.04 → 2006.04] I was trying to figure out why they might have done it.
[2006.06 → 2006.54] I have no idea.
[2006.54 → 2008.00] So it's got 49 more pins.
[2008.24 → 2012.40] We're expecting improved power delivery and support for future incremental I.O. features.
[2012.40 → 2017.50] The pin 1 position remains the same, but it has shifted the socket keying to the left.
[2017.90 → 2018.78] Previously it was right.
[2019.00 → 2024.22] Making Comet Lake processor incompatible both electrically and mechanically with previous sockets.
[2024.32 → 2025.12] We expected that.
[2025.58 → 2031.98] Generally speaking, Intel does one launch with a new platform and then one refresh and that's it.
[2031.98 → 2041.36] Platform maps of these PCI Express Gen 3 based chipsets make them look largely similar to the current 300 series platform with a few changes.
[2041.36 → 2051.12] So they've added C10 and S0IX modern standby power states which give your PC an iPad-like availability while sipping minimal power.
[2051.22 → 2051.82] That's pretty sweet.
[2051.96 → 2052.38] Sweets.
[2052.38 → 2061.72] It's slightly different from Smart Connect is that your web-connected apps and processor work at extremely low power like a fanless state rather than waking your machine from time to time for the apps to refresh.
[2061.72 → 2067.34] They have updated the networking interfaces, adding support for 2.5 gigabit wired LAN.
[2067.34 → 2068.88] So that's pretty sick.
[2069.04 → 2069.18] Yeah.
[2069.38 → 2070.80] And built-in Wi-Fi 6.
[2071.04 → 2072.14] That's pretty nice too.
[2072.98 → 2080.40] And the underlying architecture is basically identical in terms of design to Skylike circa 2015.
[2082.06 → 2082.56] Oof.
[2082.82 → 2085.54] The platform also mentions an interesting specification.
[2085.88 → 2087.98] Enhanced core and memory overclocking.
[2088.44 → 2096.68] Maybe this could be the secret ingredient that makes the i9 10900K competitive with the likes of the Ry zen 9 3900X.
[2096.68 → 2103.50] Unfortunately, by that time, AMD will supposedly have launched news and processors.
[2105.94 → 2106.92] This is just wild.
[2107.20 → 2107.56] I don't know.
[2107.78 → 2110.56] I would actually, I don't necessarily think you should actually do it.
[2110.62 → 2111.86] I've been out of the content space for a long time.
[2111.86 → 2115.72] But I would love to see a mock video of like a birthday party for Intel.
[2116.12 → 2121.56] And just going over the like, if you went over like, you know those birthday parties that are more for the parents?
[2121.56 → 2127.36] And you go over like, you learned to walk and just have it like go through all the stages.
[2128.68 → 2131.32] First, you said you didn't have any cores.
[2131.50 → 2132.54] Then you added more.
[2132.68 → 2133.80] Then you added more again.
[2133.90 → 2135.48] Then you added more, you sneaky.
[2135.60 → 2137.04] We're so proud of you.
[2137.16 → 2137.36] Yeah.
[2137.46 → 2139.86] Turns out you could do it after all, couldn't you?
[2140.06 → 2141.30] Oh, jeez.
[2142.26 → 2142.98] Oh, man.
[2143.24 → 2143.76] All right.
[2144.48 → 2145.82] Speaking of things we could do.
[2145.94 → 2148.50] Most processors don't even live to turn four.
[2152.50 → 2153.46] I'm just sorry.
[2153.72 → 2155.20] I'm just way too into that idea.
[2156.16 → 2157.50] Mac Pro pricing.
[2157.64 → 2158.34] Oh, all right.
[2158.42 → 2159.34] We got to do our sponsors.
[2159.80 → 2163.30] Use code Linus and get 50% off at madrinuscoffee.com slash Linus.
[2163.70 → 2165.84] Marines Coffee is coffee for fuel.
[2166.20 → 2168.22] Organic cold brew coffee and convenience.
[2168.44 → 2170.96] 16 ounce cans with a flavour for everyone.
[2171.52 → 2175.00] We actually have a limited edition item on their e-store.
[2175.12 → 2176.92] The LTT exclusive vanilla cold brew.
[2177.28 → 2180.18] And for the next 72 hours, guys, it's 50% off.
[2180.48 → 2184.90] By the way, supply of that limited edition can is running dangerously low.
[2185.22 → 2185.82] Stock up now.
[2185.92 → 2188.10] Once it's gone, it's gone.
[2188.26 → 2188.70] Oh, boy.
[2188.86 → 2191.48] Unless you catch one on the shelves at Micro Centre or whatever.
[2192.22 → 2194.68] I get so many people tweeting me like, hey, check this out.
[2194.70 → 2195.28] Look what I found.
[2195.28 → 2196.84] I'm like, yeah, I knew about it, obviously.
[2197.04 → 2197.96] But, yeah, cool.
[2198.10 → 2198.46] Thanks.
[2199.16 → 2202.46] I saw Shrouds in wherever I was.
[2202.56 → 2203.24] I don't even remember.
[2203.68 → 2207.02] But I was at a Micro Centre and I saw Shrouds, but I didn't see ours, and I was sad.
[2207.28 → 2210.18] Or Linus Tech Tips made me upset.
[2210.32 → 2212.26] But maybe that's because they just sold them all.
[2213.68 → 2213.98] Yeah.
[2214.04 → 2215.62] Maybe it just sells better than Shrouds.
[2215.68 → 2215.78] Yeah.
[2216.26 → 2216.46] Yeah.
[2217.22 → 2217.96] Probably not.
[2220.52 → 2224.70] Monday.com is the productivity tool that helps you manage your team.
[2224.70 → 2227.54] It's simple to set up, and it's super customizable.

[2243.36 → 2244.76] The list goes on and on.
[2245.14 → 2250.68] Sign up today and get a free trial and 10% off their yearly plans at the link below.
[2250.68 → 2254.60] I cannot say enough good things about Monday.com.
[2255.60 → 2267.18] Compared to just emailing back and forth, having a central place that everyone can go to keep track of what projects they're supposed to be working on is a great way to keep people on task.
[2267.18 → 2274.96] And if you find that decorating your space helps you stay on task, why don't you get a Displate?
[2275.58 → 2277.52] Displaces make your walls look awesome.
[2277.68 → 2278.70] They're posters made of metal.
[2278.82 → 2279.84] They're three millimetres thick.
[2279.94 → 2283.06] They've got bent edges so you won't slice your finger open putting up your Displate.
[2283.50 → 2285.18] They've got a matte finish with...
[2285.96 → 2287.86] I don't actually know how to pronounce it.
[2287.96 → 2288.72] Sickly print?
[2288.96 → 2290.48] I have no idea.
[2290.48 → 2292.64] Well, I'm sure someone's going to correct me at some point or another.
[2292.72 → 2293.64] That's the beauty of the internet.
[2294.16 → 2296.20] And they use a magnetic wall mounting system.
[2296.30 → 2299.94] So you just stick the magnetic thing to your wall and then on goes the Displate.
[2300.14 → 2301.36] Oh, you didn't put it on quite right?
[2301.98 → 2302.34] Boom.
[2302.54 → 2303.42] Adjust the Displate.
[2303.66 → 2304.46] You want to replace it?
[2304.72 → 2305.02] Boom.
[2305.14 → 2305.92] Pull off the Displate.
[2306.06 → 2307.10] Put on a different one.
[2307.10 → 2312.10] They've got 15,000 different artists that have produced over a quarter million unique artworks.
[2314.34 → 2315.50] Just like that.
[2315.86 → 2317.66] And they offer hassle-free returns.
[2317.66 → 2321.20] For every Displate sold, they plant 10 trees, and they come pre-gift packed.
[2321.28 → 2326.42] So use code LTT to save 15% at leg.GG slash Displate when.
[2326.74 → 2327.24] Very cool.
[2328.32 → 2328.88] All right.
[2328.90 → 2330.52] What else we got for topics today?
[2331.66 → 2333.94] Oh, I want to talk about that VR thing.
[2334.46 → 2334.74] Okay.
[2334.86 → 2336.10] So my friend sent me this.
[2336.22 → 2336.70] The Facebook?
[2336.70 → 2337.58] I do have friends.
[2339.08 → 2340.82] It was not actually my friend.
[2340.92 → 2342.44] It's the husband of my wife's friend.
[2344.52 → 2347.10] Look, I'm going with it, okay?
[2347.66 → 2350.68] So it's called Zero Latency VR.
[2351.14 → 2352.02] Oh, this is a different thing.
[2352.04 → 2353.18] Which is obviously nonsense.
[2353.48 → 2353.72] Yep.
[2354.88 → 2357.06] But they are apparently launching...
[2357.06 → 2357.78] Is this in the dock?
[2357.94 → 2359.14] Here in Vancouver.
[2359.50 → 2360.12] And it looks...
[2360.12 → 2361.04] Oh, I see what you're talking about.
[2361.04 → 2361.76] Sick.
[2362.28 → 2364.34] So they have a bunch of...
[2364.34 → 2368.48] Like, this is kind of honestly where VR is going to take off.
[2368.98 → 2373.46] But it's a free roam VR experience where it's kind of like laser tech.
[2373.52 → 2373.64] Okay.
[2373.68 → 2375.76] Where is the stupid thing?
[2376.78 → 2377.46] Dang it.
[2378.62 → 2379.14] Location.
[2379.24 → 2379.38] What?
[2379.44 → 2379.78] News?
[2379.90 → 2380.58] Is it under news?
[2380.58 → 2385.60] So Jay and I did a Star Wars and a horror game experience.
[2385.60 → 2385.96] Here we go.
[2386.06 → 2386.78] So it's kind of like this.
[2386.84 → 2388.96] Like, it's just an open warehouse.
[2388.98 → 2389.40] Oh, wow.
[2389.74 → 2390.42] Here we go.
[2390.86 → 2391.92] Oh, sweet.
[2392.12 → 2392.44] Okay.
[2392.70 → 2393.44] This is different.
[2393.58 → 2394.32] Where's the picture?
[2394.90 → 2396.24] I just want a picture.
[2396.24 → 2399.86] Oh, I hate you so much.
[2400.52 → 2400.76] Okay.
[2400.84 → 2401.26] So sorry.
[2401.34 → 2402.26] You and Jake did a what now?
[2403.02 → 2403.64] Whatever it is.
[2404.18 → 2405.10] Jay, not Jake.
[2405.20 → 2405.40] Sure.
[2405.74 → 2410.22] But in Vegas during CES, we did like a Star Wars themed one.
[2410.38 → 2411.88] But it wasn't a big open arena.
[2412.42 → 2415.22] It was like a guided walkthrough thing.
[2415.28 → 2419.94] Which is kind of cool because like when like a droid was there, you could reach out and
[2419.94 → 2420.66] actually touch it.
[2420.76 → 2421.50] Oh, that's pretty cool.
[2421.50 → 2425.96] Because they had like a just non-painted one of it there.
[2425.96 → 2426.24] Sure.
[2426.50 → 2429.02] Which was neat for that experience.
[2429.14 → 2431.26] But this would be super cool for like arena style combat.
[2431.28 → 2432.66] So it's backpack based.
[2432.78 → 2436.66] So you put on backpacks with the PCs and the headsets.
[2436.76 → 2438.30] They've made their own controllers and stuff.
[2438.56 → 2441.10] So you'll have like rifles and crap like that.
[2441.16 → 2444.24] So it's basically, as far as I can tell, I haven't tried it yet.
[2444.28 → 2445.52] I'm super excited to try it.
[2445.60 → 2447.06] Apparently they're building it right now.
[2448.32 → 2450.30] Oh, I was hoping it was already up.
[2450.30 → 2450.60] Yeah.
[2450.70 → 2451.26] No, no, it's not.
[2451.34 → 2451.86] It's not done yet.
[2451.86 → 2459.08] But what it sounds like to me is laser tag, but without all the assholes who are covering
[2459.08 → 2461.98] up the frigging things while they poke around the corner.
[2462.18 → 2468.32] I was driving with someone past Planet Laser, which is somewhat near our office the other
[2468.32 → 2468.62] day.
[2468.62 → 2474.66] And I mentioned how like, I doubt they've done this, but like they're going to get ran
[2474.66 → 2476.72] over by these types of solutions.
[2476.78 → 2477.14] Absolutely.
[2477.14 → 2478.80] Because it's going to be way better.
[2479.02 → 2479.18] Yeah.
[2479.48 → 2480.22] It's way, way better.
[2480.48 → 2485.80] And I gave the scenario of like, look at the if you had like Rebel Alliance versus Stormtroopers
[2485.80 → 2489.40] and you like actually look at your buddy, and he's in like Stormtrooper armour.
[2489.40 → 2489.68] Oh yeah.
[2489.70 → 2490.96] Like that'd be so cool.
[2491.08 → 2492.22] It's going to be so sick.
[2492.32 → 2492.52] Yeah.
[2492.74 → 2496.50] And maybe this implementation, honestly, isn't that great, but it'll come.
[2496.50 → 2497.06] But it's the direction.
[2497.26 → 2497.42] Yeah.
[2497.48 → 2498.56] That's the direction it's going.
[2498.68 → 2499.72] That's 100% experience.
[2499.86 → 2504.72] And like laser tag places, they have the opportunity to make this investment and still stay relevant,
[2505.00 → 2506.04] but not for long.
[2506.04 → 2506.52] Yeah.
[2506.62 → 2510.02] It will not be a long time before you're just like, and the stupid thing is like, they
[2510.02 → 2511.92] might look at it and go, whoa, hold on.
[2512.00 → 2515.90] Like two grand a pop for like PCs for everyone's back.
[2515.90 → 2521.80] And like, you know, a bunch of VR headsets and like, oh my goodness, all this tracking equipment.
[2521.94 → 2523.34] It's like, okay, stop.
[2523.48 → 2524.64] I'm going to stop you right there.
[2525.02 → 2529.04] Do you remember back when laser tag equipment was super expensive?
[2529.04 → 2533.92] So now it's gotten commodity, and you're like enjoying that or whatever.
[2534.12 → 2535.58] But, but that's what happens.
[2535.60 → 2536.26] It's a cycle.
[2536.36 → 2538.00] You have to, you have to move on.
[2538.32 → 2539.40] You have to move on.
[2540.34 → 2540.74] Yeah.
[2540.84 → 2542.04] This will absolutely take over.
[2542.04 → 2548.38] Cause even just the like the guided experience that Jay, myself and some other people did,
[2548.64 → 2550.20] uh, was, was amazing.
[2550.48 → 2553.78] But the whole time you're like in a kind of cramped room, Jay and I are big guys.
[2553.92 → 2557.92] So there isn't like a ton of room for us to move around in these small hallways.
[2558.16 → 2558.48] He means tall.
[2558.48 → 2559.04] He means tall, Jay.
[2559.28 → 2559.78] Calm down.
[2559.78 → 2562.58] Um, I mean, have you seen his arms?
[2564.00 → 2565.24] Jay's a big guy in a few different ways.
[2565.64 → 2572.36] Um, but it's, it's, uh, well, that I, I didn't intend for that to go that direction, but I'm
[2572.36 → 2573.52] just going to keep plowing forward.
[2573.94 → 2580.46] Um, it's, it's, it's going to be very cool to be able to move more freely in, in, in a
[2580.46 → 2584.48] space and actually like they could put fake terrain in there and stuff.
[2584.52 → 2585.60] I don't know what they're going to do.
[2585.60 → 2588.10] It's probably not just going to be an open virtual room though.
[2588.10 → 2593.04] Um, for now I think it is, but in the future I could totally see.
[2593.14 → 2597.72] Cause the thing about an open room is its less hazardous, and you could always put virtual
[2597.72 → 2601.92] obstacles that block other people's lasers, and you can lean around and stuff.
[2602.06 → 2602.74] But that's what I mean.
[2602.82 → 2602.94] Yeah.
[2602.94 → 2606.80] You're not actually at risk of like, that's, that's, I think virtually they might put up
[2606.80 → 2607.40] some terrain.
[2607.58 → 2608.30] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2608.30 → 2608.74] For sure.
[2608.82 → 2610.28] I don't think they're going to do that otherwise.
[2610.28 → 2614.02] And they could make it like, so they're like, oh, like virtual glass.
[2614.30 → 2616.18] So you can see through it or something.
[2616.18 → 2619.20] So you know if people are hiding behind cover, and you know that it's obviously not real.
[2619.20 → 2622.72] So you won't lean against it or something, but they could put up cover and stuff like
[2622.72 → 2622.90] that.
[2622.90 → 2627.00] I think that would be a good idea because it'll make the game a lot more, um, tactical.
[2627.00 → 2628.64] Someone just said no love for Jay.
[2628.76 → 2631.32] I think Luke was saying all the love for Jay.
[2631.50 → 2632.18] It's just super.
[2632.26 → 2632.36] No.
[2632.54 → 2632.80] Yeah.
[2632.90 → 2633.04] Yeah.
[2633.04 → 2633.72] Lots of love.
[2633.78 → 2633.90] Yeah.
[2633.96 → 2634.84] Almost too much.
[2634.94 → 2635.52] Too much love.
[2635.62 → 2635.74] Yeah.
[2635.74 → 2636.70] Um, all right.
[2636.76 → 2639.66] Mac Pro pricing posted by William CLL on the forum.
[2640.38 → 2646.24] Basically the top config is $52,000, but I feel like this headline is really silly.
[2646.88 → 2653.72] Um, yeah, honestly, because the top configuration of it, nobody, you're not, it's not like you
[2653.72 → 2657.78] have your arm twisted that you have to buy a terabyte and a half of Ram.
[2657.78 → 2660.62] Um, that's, that's in the top configuration.
[2660.62 → 2660.88] Yeah.
[2661.10 → 2663.14] Like it's not the it's not the default configuration.
[2663.48 → 2669.08] Look, look, Mac community and PC people who like ribbing the Mac community.
[2669.08 → 2673.60] Guys, you can't, you can't keep sending mixed messages out of one half of your mouth.
[2673.72 → 2676.86] You're like, Apple, your computers don't go high-end enough.
[2676.96 → 2678.66] You're not taking professionals seriously.
[2678.66 → 2686.82] And then when Apple releases a computer that is capable of specs that are approaching the
[2686.82 → 2693.20] top of what can be built with hardware that exists today while, you know, looking subjectively
[2693.20 → 2695.24] pretty sexy and apparently being quiet.
[2695.34 → 2695.70] I don't know.
[2695.76 → 2696.56] We don't have one yet.
[2697.00 → 2699.86] Uh, you don't get to complain about it.
[2700.22 → 2702.08] You can't have it both ways.
[2702.08 → 2708.28] Like, are you actually, were you actually already a customer for a 28 core Intel Leon W?
[2708.28 → 2709.30] Yeah, exactly.
[2709.44 → 2712.68] Now, now, now there are things we can complain about.
[2713.00 → 2716.26] Uh, 25 grand for the 1.5 terabytes of Ram.
[2716.64 → 2719.90] It's not too bad, but it's also not great.
[2720.26 → 2725.12] Um, the we, we just did a video, uh, that hasn't gone up yet, uh, playing around with a
[2725.12 → 2729.64] system with two terabytes of Ram and that Ram cost about 25 grand.
[2729.64 → 2731.68] So you're, you're overpaying.
[2731.76 → 2732.68] You're paying the Apple tax.
[2732.70 → 2733.48] You're going to be overpaying for it.
[2733.48 → 2733.60] Yeah.
[2733.64 → 2737.50] And if you were smart, you would just buy a base spec one in terms of the Ram.
[2737.50 → 2739.56] Um, and, uh, are you playing around with the builder?
[2739.68 → 2740.88] Do you want, do you want me to throw it over on your screen?
[2740.90 → 2741.04] Yeah, sure.
[2741.20 → 2745.14] So you could just buy a base spec one and then put in your own Ram later, flip that other
[2745.14 → 2750.18] Ram on eBay or whatever, or hold onto it in case you need to get support for your Mac or
[2750.18 → 2751.32] whatever the case may be.
[2751.32 → 2753.36] Um, so I'm not saying it's a great deal.
[2753.64 → 2757.50] Um, same thing with the processor, the top tier processor, the, uh, you know, whatever
[2757.50 → 2760.80] it is, uh, 3290 something.
[2761.32 → 2761.50] Yeah.
[2761.54 → 2768.08] They don't, they don't put the model number because, but the W39 some 32, nine something.
[2768.18 → 2768.52] I, whatever.
[2768.60 → 2768.98] It doesn't matter.
[2768.98 → 2771.10] It's the 31 95.
[2771.44 → 2772.72] So 32 95, I guess.
[2773.36 → 2774.04] Who cares?
[2774.04 → 2778.04] The 28 core processor, um, is not well priced.
[2778.14 → 2782.74] You can get that thing for like four grand elsewhere, and they want more than that for the upgrade
[2782.74 → 2784.60] and you don't even get the one that it ships with then.
[2784.72 → 2788.20] I don't know what the tech for the SSD is, but those prices are nuts too.
[2788.50 → 2789.08] Those prices.
[2789.08 → 2790.22] I don't know what it's based on though.
[2790.30 → 2790.56] Yeah.
[2790.76 → 2793.58] So Apple's SSDs are very fast.
[2793.74 → 2794.00] Okay.
[2794.00 → 2799.82] So you have to be like, I've seen people just like finding some bargain-basement Dreamless
[2799.82 → 2802.60] SSD and being like, Apple's overpriced.
[2803.20 → 2805.18] Like, no, no, no.
[2805.40 → 2808.02] The SSD is really fast.
[2808.14 → 2809.32] It's a fast NVMe SSD.
[2809.64 → 2813.96] It is not apples to apples against some crappy SATA SSD.
[2814.06 → 2815.38] They don't detail in here.
[2815.72 → 2818.24] No, you have to just test it for yourself, unfortunately.
[2818.54 → 2820.64] So, yeah, I don't know.
[2820.84 → 2822.54] Like it doesn't even say if it's NVMe or not.
[2822.68 → 2823.10] It is.
[2823.10 → 2824.66] I am expecting it to.
[2824.68 → 2827.50] I completely believe you, and it would make sense that it would be considering they even
[2827.50 → 2828.88] did that in their damn phones a while back.
[2828.96 → 2830.36] But like, it doesn't say.
[2830.62 → 2832.86] I'm expecting the SSDs to be really fast.
[2833.00 → 2837.66] It's just, you know, it's one of those things where you might not agree with the choices
[2837.66 → 2838.28] Apple's made.
[2838.38 → 2841.08] Like we talked about this in our review of the iMac Pro.
[2841.38 → 2844.10] You might not agree that Apple put a Leon in it.
[2844.18 → 2850.02] That might feel unnecessary to you because a Core i9 is functionally identical other than not
[2850.02 → 2852.78] supporting ECC memory for $500 less.
[2852.78 → 2856.32] Not to mention that the unbuffered memory that you can then use with it is also cheaper.
[2856.80 → 2861.60] You might not agree with them, you know, going and having AMD engineer some custom stupid
[2861.60 → 2866.12] version of their card that has, oh, a different special power connector instead of just plugging
[2866.12 → 2867.30] a damn cable into it.
[2867.30 → 2874.02] But whether you agree with their choices or not, that doesn't mean that for the thing
[2874.02 → 2876.46] that Apple is providing, their price is necessarily unreasonable.
[2876.58 → 2880.68] Now, I do think the Mac Pro pricing is kind of dumb, but I think people are attacking the
[2880.68 → 2882.50] wrong spectrum of the Mac Pro pricing.
[2882.84 → 2886.24] They're attacking the top tier price, which is something nobody should be buying anyway,
[2886.24 → 2891.30] when really what they should be attacking is the base spec price, where you're investing
[2891.30 → 2899.32] most of your money, as far as I can tell, into like days of CNC time on this chassis for
[2899.32 → 2901.86] like an eight core processor.
[2902.10 → 2903.44] And like, what does that by default?
[2903.44 → 2904.44] 32 gigs of RAM.
[2904.44 → 2905.32] 32 gigs of RAM.
[2906.70 → 2914.42] Like, a Radeon Pro 580X, which don't kid yourself, is just a 580X with some driver switches flipped.
[2915.12 → 2916.32] 256 gigs of storage.
[2916.34 → 2918.88] Like, literally a last generation graphics card.
[2919.54 → 2920.44] Like, come on.
[2921.60 → 2923.06] That's what people should be mocking.
[2923.22 → 2924.54] You get a magic mouse, too.
[2924.66 → 2925.40] Oh, boy.
[2925.54 → 2925.94] Oh, boy.
[2925.98 → 2927.62] I can flip my mouse over to charge it.
[2927.84 → 2932.04] You know, I had a really frustrating experience with my AirPods 2s the other night.
[2932.04 → 2935.96] So, I mostly use them with an Android phone.
[2936.60 → 2942.96] And I knew already going into this relationship with my AirPods that there's no way to update
[2942.96 → 2945.08] the firmware on an Android device.
[2945.42 → 2947.66] You can't just, or at least no first party way.
[2947.76 → 2950.24] I haven't actually looked into whether there's some hacky way to do it.
[2950.86 → 2951.96] To my knowledge, there isn't.
[2952.06 → 2953.40] But feel free to tell me if I'm wrong.
[2953.44 → 2954.02] You guys love that.
[2954.66 → 2959.30] So, anyway, I knew that I was going to need to connect it to an Apple device at some point
[2959.30 → 2960.30] if I wanted to update the firmware.
[2960.30 → 2965.66] So, I was having this weird issue that cropped up where sometimes only one of them would activate
[2965.66 → 2966.34] the noise cancellation.
[2967.36 → 2968.50] And it was super bizarre.
[2968.94 → 2972.28] Like, I would go, and I would press the thing, and it would just toggle that one.
[2972.50 → 2975.12] And then I'd go and toggle this one, and then they would be, like, resynced.
[2975.18 → 2976.50] So, everything would sound like it was echoing.
[2976.56 → 2977.08] Super buggy.
[2977.14 → 2977.34] Anyway.
[2977.34 → 2982.42] What I found out, I googled it, was I was running a firmware on this that was, like,
[2982.98 → 2985.94] pre the one that I found online was supposed to be the release one.
[2986.26 → 2987.40] And I was like, oh, okay.
[2987.48 → 2988.82] So, I've got, like, ancient firmware.
[2988.94 → 2990.38] There are two more updates since then.
[2990.52 → 2992.10] So, I'm like, okay, how do I update this?
[2993.28 → 2995.64] And so, I'm going through this, like, guide.
[2995.80 → 2998.26] Because I couldn't even find, like, the watch.
[2998.40 → 2999.18] There's just an app.
[2999.54 → 2999.82] Okay.
[2999.94 → 3001.30] So, there's an icon on your home screen.
[3001.42 → 3002.44] You just click your watch app.
[3002.74 → 3004.18] But AirPods don't have that.
[3004.42 → 3006.30] You have to go into, where's my iPhone?
[3006.46 → 3007.02] It doesn't matter.
[3007.08 → 3007.26] Anyway.
[3007.62 → 3008.68] I think I left it upstairs.
[3008.86 → 3013.24] Anyway, the point is you have to go into, like, software, about, and then you scroll down
[3013.24 → 3014.02] and you find AirPods.
[3014.32 → 3016.84] But only if they're nearby and the case is open.
[3017.42 → 3019.04] So, otherwise, it's just not there.
[3019.22 → 3021.20] I'm like, oh, well, that's genius.
[3021.34 → 3021.82] Love it.
[3023.06 → 3023.74] It's magic.
[3023.84 → 3024.50] It just works, you know.
[3024.66 → 3025.72] So, anyway, I go in there.
[3025.74 → 3027.98] I'm like, where's the freaking firmware update button?
[3029.18 → 3030.58] And there isn't one.
[3031.16 → 3032.48] And so, I keep reading the article.
[3033.80 → 3034.94] Excuse me?
[3035.36 → 3036.56] So, here's how it works.
[3036.80 → 3043.64] If you want to update the firmware of your AirPods, you connect them to a charging device.
[3043.76 → 3044.08] Okay.
[3044.74 → 3045.78] Open them.
[3047.16 → 3048.82] Leave them near your iPhone.
[3050.06 → 3058.86] And then, when Apple deems the time to be right, they will push a firmware update to your
[3058.86 → 3059.26] AirPods.
[3060.84 → 3062.74] And I was like, oh, my God.
[3063.04 → 3064.66] What if I'm having a problem now?
[3064.80 → 3066.74] See, this is my problem with Apple.
[3067.08 → 3070.56] I have no issue with things magically working.
[3070.76 → 3075.00] In fact, I'm a big fan of stuff just working in my life.
[3075.00 → 3089.18] The problem is that Apple is so dedicated to this, it just works philosophy that they seem to, it seems like their brains just jam when something doesn't work.
[3089.34 → 3094.44] And I remember having this experience a number of years ago when I did the switched to Mac.
[3094.44 → 3100.24] And I was using the iMac, I think it was the iMac 5K as my daily driver for a month.
[3100.24 → 3107.50] And I had this issue where I knew that there was a file in this folder in Finder that was there.
[3107.60 → 3111.80] Or it was like a network directory or something that wasn't loading or wasn't updating correctly.
[3112.04 → 3117.00] And I was trying to figure out how to update the damn thing, how to force refresh it.
[3117.34 → 3122.86] And I found out that in Finder, you may not do that.
[3122.86 → 3127.18] And the only responses I could find were that, well, it should show up.
[3127.72 → 3128.24] Right.
[3128.80 → 3129.76] It should.
[3130.40 → 3132.38] But what about when it doesn't?
[3133.28 → 3136.08] There has to be recourse for that.
[3136.30 → 3138.36] And so this is exactly the same thing.
[3138.54 → 3140.16] So I left it there for a while.
[3140.76 → 3141.54] I walked away.
[3141.64 → 3143.30] And it just didn't update.
[3143.70 → 3145.20] So I was like, okay.
[3145.68 → 3148.46] So I connected it.
[3148.48 → 3149.80] And then I connected the phone too.
[3149.80 → 3151.42] And I left them for another half an hour.
[3151.44 → 3152.02] And I came back.
[3152.22 → 3153.00] And it did.
[3153.08 → 3154.82] And I'm like, oh, thank goodness.
[3154.98 → 3156.94] I'm running the latest version of the firmware now.
[3158.16 → 3159.04] What if it didn't?
[3159.94 → 3160.64] Then what?
[3161.64 → 3163.12] It's just so stupid to me.
[3163.20 → 3167.46] It's like this whole thing where apply buttons have gone out of fashion.
[3167.84 → 3168.16] Yeah.
[3168.70 → 3172.40] Well, it should just update on.
[3172.50 → 3173.50] Well, what if it doesn't?
[3173.82 → 3176.44] What if I just want the peace of mind of knowing that it's done?
[3176.44 → 3182.68] What I like is when it does it automatically, but there's also a button that cues it up.
[3184.02 → 3184.50] What?
[3184.74 → 3185.60] I don't like that.
[3185.78 → 3186.06] Why?
[3186.48 → 3188.78] Because I want my button to be the only.
[3188.90 → 3190.52] I want the button to be the gatekeeper.
[3190.82 → 3193.94] When I press the update button, I want it to update.
[3194.04 → 3195.64] Not before and not after.
[3196.88 → 3202.16] Unless I check automatic updates, but I still want a button to check.
[3202.82 → 3204.10] I just want to know.
[3205.06 → 3205.86] Okay, boomer.
[3205.86 → 3208.32] And the other thing, oh, oh, the other stupid thing too.
[3208.66 → 3214.28] Once I got to the menu, I had to just Google whether the firmware version I had was current.
[3214.86 → 3216.52] It didn't say there's an update.
[3216.52 → 3217.40] Current version or something.
[3217.40 → 3221.42] It's just like, you know, A, B, 5, 8, 5, whatever.
[3221.64 → 3224.28] Like it was just literally a string of five characters.
[3224.42 → 3225.22] That's the firmware version.
[3225.32 → 3226.52] It doesn't say if there's a new one.
[3226.78 → 3228.18] Drives me nuts.
[3228.18 → 3233.76] So one thing before we move on from this Apple topic is can you switch back to my screen?
[3234.10 → 3234.82] Yeah, I sure can.
[3235.10 → 3237.04] So I noticed this while you were talking.
[3237.18 → 3237.34] Yeah.
[3237.98 → 3238.88] It's not cut off.
[3238.88 → 3241.64] At the very top, just a little gray banner thing.
[3241.64 → 3248.96] Get 6% daily cash back when you buy from Apple and pay with Apple Card until December 31st.
[3248.96 → 3249.42] Pretty sick.
[3249.54 → 3252.62] Broadcast it on the Mac Pro webpage.
[3252.84 → 3253.34] Pretty sick.
[3253.34 → 3257.88] You will very possibly be buying a multi $10,000 computer.
[3259.30 → 3264.08] And then you go learn more, and it's like, yeah, you get it in a bunch of places and stuff, whatever.
[3264.42 → 3269.94] But I bet you they're getting a ton of card signups just due to how expensive their computer is.
[3270.02 → 3270.32] Yep.
[3270.82 → 3271.58] Wouldn't surprise me.
[3271.60 → 3272.58] Which is kind of amazing.
[3272.68 → 3272.82] Yep.
[3272.90 → 3275.82] In fact, it wouldn't surprise me if they're getting like corporate card signups too.
[3276.10 → 3278.50] Because that's what I would be after if I was them.
[3278.96 → 3281.68] Getting those corporate cards switched over to Apple cards.
[3281.68 → 3285.30] So that all them corporate expenditures.
[3285.50 → 3286.60] Like our credit card.
[3287.50 → 3288.78] Because we put everything on it.
[3288.82 → 3289.14] Why not?
[3289.62 → 3291.30] We get benefits from ours as well.
[3291.48 → 3291.62] Yeah.
[3291.72 → 3292.80] Not 6% cash back.
[3292.88 → 3293.50] That's pretty sick.
[3293.78 → 3294.34] Well, it's temporary.
[3294.34 → 3295.48] So don't buy that much stuff from Apple.com.
[3295.60 → 3295.82] Yeah.
[3295.98 → 3300.74] I think you get 3% from elsewhere, but only until December 31st or something.
[3301.54 → 3302.60] But yeah, whatever.
[3302.78 → 3303.92] I just I find that amazing.
[3303.92 → 3304.90] Because yeah, corporate.
[3305.12 → 3307.12] I mean, if you're buying 30 of these.
[3308.40 → 3308.84] Yeah, I know.
[3308.84 → 3311.34] And they're like $15,000 version or something like that.
[3311.68 → 3313.06] That's painful.
[3313.44 → 3313.66] Yeah.
[3313.86 → 3314.54] That's painful.
[3314.76 → 3319.92] We're buying one, and I'm already like trying to figure out how to do the review within 15 days so we can return it.
[3320.22 → 3321.38] Let's go 16 core.
[3321.44 → 3322.12] Not even joking.
[3322.26 → 3322.76] 96 gigs of review.
[3322.76 → 3323.76] Like I don't want to keep that thing.
[3323.80 → 3325.40] What do I need an expensive computer for?
[3326.18 → 3330.96] I told Anthony we should figure out a way to strap the Pro XDR display to the side and make it a backpack.
[3331.82 → 3332.30] Why?
[3332.76 → 3333.08] Because.
[3333.36 → 3333.76] Why not?
[3333.76 → 3335.80] It's a portable PC.
[3336.02 → 3336.22] Yeah.
[3336.34 → 3336.94] Portable computer.
[3337.10 → 3337.22] Yeah.
[3337.42 → 3338.16] Portable Mac Pro.
[3341.18 → 3344.76] Can you move Final Cut Pro from one system to another?
[3345.40 → 3345.66] Yeah.
[3346.04 → 3346.32] Okay.
[3346.62 → 3347.56] So we won't buy that.
[3347.76 → 3347.94] Okay.
[3348.00 → 3348.16] Yeah.
[3348.22 → 3349.96] So like probably $14,200.
[3351.24 → 3352.98] Is that your sensible configuration?
[3353.18 → 3354.66] I threw in a 16 core processor.
[3354.66 → 3354.82] Sure.
[3354.90 → 3355.56] That seems reasonable.
[3355.64 → 3357.08] I threw in 96 gigs of RAM.
[3357.18 → 3357.32] Yeah.
[3357.32 → 3360.46] I threw in the highest end single GPU.
[3360.62 → 3361.34] You just want a single GPU.
[3361.38 → 3364.60] We went with the highest end a single card dual GPU.
[3364.82 → 3365.40] We went with that one.
[3365.40 → 3365.54] Okay.
[3365.72 → 3365.96] Yeah.
[3366.32 → 3372.96] That way we have the potential to upgrade while still maintaining our maximum slot filling potential.
[3372.96 → 3373.40] Yeah.
[3373.76 → 3373.96] Yeah.
[3373.98 → 3374.68] That makes sense.
[3374.86 → 3375.80] I was trying to keep that open.
[3375.88 → 3376.52] That makes sense though.
[3376.70 → 3377.70] I went two terabytes SSD.
[3377.88 → 3378.38] That's reasonable.
[3378.38 → 3383.20] I mean you should be working off a network on anything that's bigger than two terabytes anyway if you're not crazy.
[3383.20 → 3388.02] Like you shouldn't be doing anything locally on a computer in this day and age if you're doing real work.
[3388.52 → 3390.04] I did throw in the afterburner card.
[3390.04 → 3390.58] We did too.
[3390.66 → 3391.50] I want to see what it does.
[3391.62 → 3391.80] Yeah.
[3392.18 → 3392.38] Yeah.
[3392.78 → 3393.44] And then just.
[3393.54 → 3395.36] I want to see if we can run it in a Hackintosh.
[3396.12 → 3396.90] The afterburner card.
[3396.94 → 3398.42] It's just PCI-E.
[3398.64 → 3401.76] It doesn't have their extra pins on the end.
[3401.94 → 3402.30] Interesting.
[3402.54 → 3402.84] Yeah.
[3403.08 → 3404.84] So I really want to see if that'll work.
[3404.84 → 3405.92] I also want to see.
[3406.18 → 3408.00] Because as far as I know they're not selling it separately.
[3408.54 → 3413.00] So I also want to see if we can throw the afterburner in just like a Racer core.
[3413.82 → 3416.12] And then hook it up via Thunderbolt to like a Mac Pro.
[3416.58 → 3421.16] So it's like how much of the amazing performance of the new Mac Pro.
[3421.24 → 3428.00] Because the thing about Apple's software is because they've had trash machines only for like six years.
[3428.42 → 3430.60] Their software is so well optimized.
[3430.86 → 3433.70] Like you can edit 8K footage in Final Cut on a freaking laptop.
[3433.84 → 3439.34] So I wonder if a ton of the amazing performance of the Mac Pro is just this bloody afterburner card.
[3439.62 → 3441.82] That if they sold it separately you could hook it up to a MacBook.
[3441.82 → 3444.94] So I'm not saying that's definitely it.
[3444.98 → 3446.52] I'm just saying it might be it.
[3446.94 → 3447.52] I did.
[3447.68 → 3450.74] I will say if you click on the do I need an afterburner thing.
[3450.74 → 3453.76] It says at the very bottom after like explaining what it is.
[3453.76 → 3455.94] If you purchase an afterburner for your Mac Pro.
[3456.08 → 3460.74] It will come pre-installed in PCI Express slot 5 16X.
[3461.46 → 3462.64] Or X16 whatever.
[3462.96 → 3464.40] To enable maximum performance.
[3464.44 → 3464.68] Okay.
[3464.74 → 3465.14] Well, thanks.
[3465.14 → 3468.20] So you can challenge an official claim.
[3468.52 → 3468.96] Yeah.
[3470.24 → 3472.94] We've got a comment from Jamal on Float plane.
[3473.60 → 3476.00] 10 gigabit Ethernet switches are still not cheap Linus.
[3476.08 → 3477.68] Local storage will survive until it is.
[3478.14 → 3480.48] We're talking about the Mac Pro.
[3481.34 → 3481.70] Okay.
[3481.92 → 3482.76] Still not cheap.
[3483.10 → 3486.76] We see pretty much the base version being about $14,200.
[3487.64 → 3488.04] Yeah.
[3488.10 → 3491.02] You can get a 10 gig switch for $500.
[3491.48 → 3494.54] And if you're in an editing office, and you have like 10 of these.
[3494.92 → 3497.04] I think you can afford a 10 gig switch.
[3497.48 → 3500.98] $140,000 roughly on just the towers.
[3501.64 → 3502.58] Not a...
[3502.58 → 3503.68] $5,000 displays.
[3503.80 → 3504.66] $1,000 stands.
[3505.30 → 3506.96] I think you got this.
[3507.20 → 3507.34] You know?
[3507.46 → 3508.42] I think you can buy that networking.
[3508.50 → 3508.62] Yeah.
[3508.66 → 3510.44] I think you can get that switch.
[3510.64 → 3511.38] No problem.
[3513.06 → 3513.50] Alright.
[3513.72 → 3514.28] What else we got?
[3514.34 → 3515.74] We got any other like big topics?
[3515.86 → 3517.22] Say Nick you're standing there so patiently.
[3517.32 → 3518.08] What can we do for you?
[3518.14 → 3519.32] Well question about the Mac Pro.
[3519.40 → 3520.34] Does it have a T2 chip?
[3520.64 → 3521.24] Yes it does.
[3521.36 → 3521.88] Oh my God.
[3521.98 → 3522.30] Unfortunately.
[3522.86 → 3522.94] Yeah.
[3524.02 → 3524.96] That's so crazy.
[3524.96 → 3526.20] I didn't even think about that.
[3526.32 → 3526.38] Yeah.
[3526.86 → 3531.14] So I'm just going to make a comment of if you want one of those shirts you should get it
[3531.14 → 3533.42] before they're gone because they're moving quickly.
[3533.64 → 3534.06] Oh, are they?
[3534.06 → 3534.58] Yeah.
[3534.80 → 3536.06] Oh people are into this hey?
[3536.22 → 3536.82] Love it.
[3537.00 → 3537.34] Cool.
[3537.46 → 3537.96] That's cool.
[3537.98 → 3538.98] So if you want one get it.
[3539.22 → 3540.34] They might not last the weekend.
[3540.48 → 3544.94] I will also say if you come to LTX this gray is a very nice signing colour.
[3545.92 → 3547.22] I'm just...
[3547.22 → 3549.26] Black Sharpe will look perfect on this.
[3549.38 → 3550.24] Listen to this guy.
[3550.24 → 3550.78] I'm just saying.
[3551.22 → 3552.90] Or the like white.
[3552.90 → 3553.00] Chill.
[3553.00 → 3553.50] Chill.
[3553.50 → 3553.60] Chill.
[3553.60 → 3553.70] Chill.
[3553.70 → 3554.10] Chill.
[3554.10 → 3554.70] Yeah.
[3555.14 → 3555.42] Yeah.
[3555.42 → 3559.96] But yeah I'm just trying to look out for our little float plane fans over here.
[3560.14 → 3560.42] Yeah.
[3560.42 → 3562.28] If you want one of them shirts you should get it now.
[3562.48 → 3562.74] FÜRTH.
[3562.98 → 3564.04] I'm kind of...
[3564.06 → 3565.06] I'm kind of curious.
[3565.06 → 3566.82] I'm logging into my station.
[3566.82 → 3568.50] Do you want to talk through the Oculus thing?
[3568.50 → 3569.50] Sure.
[3569.50 → 3570.72] Let me find it real quick.
[3570.72 → 3574.98] So Facebook to use Oculus VR data for ad purposes.
[3574.98 → 3576.50] Oculus is...
[3576.50 → 3578.44] We're so surprised!
[3578.44 → 3578.94] Guys!
[3578.94 → 3583.54] This is what everybody was talking about back when we were still working out of the house.
[3583.54 → 3584.54] Um...
[3584.54 → 3585.10] I know right?
[3585.10 → 3588.16] Right when Facebook bought Oculus we were like, Well!
[3588.16 → 3590.56] Wonder what they're going to do with it long run.
[3590.56 → 3591.76] And they were like, Oh nothing!
[3591.76 → 3592.88] And we were like, Oh yeah whatever.
[3592.88 → 3594.88] We want Oculus to be just the way it is!
[3594.88 → 3599.32] We're going to leave them alone and not get rid of the leadership except they're all gone!
[3599.32 → 3600.32] Except they're all gone!
[3600.32 → 3601.32] Yeah!
[3601.32 → 3603.32] Literally every single one of them.
[3603.32 → 3610.32] So yeah, they're rolling out a new social feature that requires you to log into Facebook on Oculus to use.
[3610.32 → 3617.76] When you do this, Oculus data is shared with Facebook to inform ads you see them when you log into Facebook on Oculus.
[3617.76 → 3623.16] If you choose not to log into Facebook on Oculus or you choose to log out of Facebook from Oculus,
[3623.16 → 3628.48] your Oculus information won't be shared with Facebook to show you more personalized content including ads.
[3628.48 → 3629.48] Um...
[3629.48 → 3633.72] It doesn't say if that means it will be shared at all.
[3633.72 → 3638.52] It just says it won't be shared FOR more personalized content including ads.
[3638.52 → 3639.52] Sweet.
[3639.52 → 3645.96] If you have logged into Facebook on Oculus and then log out, no new data will be shared with Facebook.
[3645.96 → 3653.76] However, Oculus may use your information for its own advertising purposes in accordance with the Oculus privacy policy.
[3653.76 → 3655.48] Fantastic!
[3655.48 → 3658.80] One thing that I want to tangent on here real quick...
[3658.80 → 3659.28] Hit me.
[3659.28 → 3668.92] ...does I haven't been there yet, but I have been informed that Guilford Mall has advertising kiosks that look very much like touch screen things.
[3668.92 → 3670.36] Oh, okay.
[3670.36 → 3671.36] They're all new fancy stuff.
[3671.36 → 3675.36] And they have a camera at the top that points straight down at your face.
[3675.36 → 3676.80] Like it's not out at the thing.
[3676.80 → 3678.80] It's for anyone that is up looking at the kiosk.
[3678.80 → 3679.80] Yeah.
[3679.80 → 3690.24] Um, and right now it doesn't seem like it's doing much but fully suspecting that's going to be dynamic advertisements based on facial recognition.
[3690.24 → 3691.68] I think that's the longer term.
[3691.68 → 3696.68] I think for now what they're probably gauging is the effectiveness of the ads.
[3696.68 → 3698.12] Which ones are the most eye-catching?
[3698.12 → 3699.12] Um...
[3699.12 → 3700.12] Very likely that would make sense.
[3700.12 → 3701.12] In the long term it'll be both.
[3701.12 → 3702.12] Yep.
[3702.12 → 3703.12] Absolutely.
[3703.12 → 3704.12] Totally makes sense.
[3704.12 → 3706.36] Um, so yeah.
[3706.36 → 3709.12] We moved 90 of these shirts already.
[3709.12 → 3710.12] Nice!
[3710.12 → 3711.12] Um, so...
[3711.12 → 3712.12] So I need some for the staff.
[3712.12 → 3714.12] We actually did not print that many.
[3714.12 → 3715.12] Yeah.
[3715.12 → 3717.12] So guys move fast if you want one.
[3717.12 → 3718.12] Yeah.
[3718.12 → 3719.12] I think that's...
[3719.12 → 3721.12] I'm going to have to like place my own order.
[3721.12 → 3725.56] Wow, we only talked about like four topics today, but I still felt like it was a really...
[3725.56 → 3726.56] Some chunky topics.
[3726.56 → 3728.56] Yeah, really, really rich topics.
[3728.56 → 3731.12] Oh guys, we do have some internal news.
[3731.12 → 3732.12] Um...
[3732.12 → 3733.12] Oh!
[3733.12 → 3735.12] LMG Clips is a new channel that we just started.
[3735.12 → 3737.36] Actually, it's a couple of people found it already.
[3737.36 → 3739.12] Oops, I just searched for LMG Chips.
[3739.12 → 3741.12] Uh, LMG Clips.
[3741.12 → 3745.12] Oh man, this is going to bring up a bunch of light machine gun like ammunition and stuff, isn't it?
[3745.12 → 3746.12] Oh, here we go.
[3746.12 → 3747.12] We'll have to take that over.
[3747.12 → 3748.12] Oh no, it's there.
[3748.12 → 3749.12] Oh wow, look at that.
[3749.12 → 3750.12] They've like already got stuff on it and stuff.
[3750.12 → 3756.12] So LMG Clips is going to have just little snippets from the WAN show or from...
[3756.12 → 3757.12] Oh, it's like mixed.
[3757.12 → 3758.12] Yeah.
[3758.12 → 3759.12] Cool.
[3759.12 → 3761.12] Just like other videos.
[3761.12 → 3763.12] So it won't all be me necessarily.
[3763.12 → 3764.12] Sweet.
[3764.12 → 3765.12] Yeah.
[3765.12 → 3766.12] Huh.
[3766.12 → 3767.12] This is pretty cute.
[3767.12 → 3775.12] So we actually have one of the writers that we hired in the last round, but that is still
[3775.12 → 3782.12] working on a visa from the old UK there.
[3782.12 → 3783.12] So the idea is doing this for us.
[3783.12 → 3788.12] Going through the WAN show and like kind of time stamping out the things that are good and
[3788.12 → 3790.12] then we're kind of doing batches of thumbnails.
[3790.12 → 3796.12] So the idea is that if you don't feel like watching the entire WAN show, I realize I'm talking to completely the
[3796.12 → 3797.12] wrong audience right now.
[3797.12 → 3798.12] People who literally just watch...
[3798.12 → 3799.12] Watch the whole show.
[3799.12 → 3801.12] The entire WAN show.
[3801.12 → 3806.12] Then this is a way to kind of get some highlights, and it won't just be WAN show, but it'll be
[3806.12 → 3807.12] other stuff too.
[3807.12 → 3813.12] In the future we may move WAN show off of the main LTT channel because it's been kind of a boat anchor on the
[3813.12 → 3816.12] performance of the channel for quite some time.
[3816.12 → 3822.12] And as far as we know the concept of momentum on a YouTube channel is very real.
[3822.12 → 3827.12] So this will be a way to kind of keep up to date even if you stop seeing WAN show in the place that you're
[3827.12 → 3828.12] accustomed to seeing it.
[3828.12 → 3829.12] So that's going to be pretty cool.
[3829.12 → 3832.12] And then other than that, it's just super chats.
[3832.12 → 3835.12] I feel like I should go through some super chats with you all.
[3835.12 → 3837.12] What have we got in here?
[3837.12 → 3839.12] Why is that under the viewer activity tab?
[3839.12 → 3840.12] I don't know.
[3840.12 → 3841.12] Isn't it madness?
[3841.12 → 3845.12] Kyle Driver says the next Xbox is going to be revolutionary.
[3845.12 → 3846.12] Get it 360?
[3846.12 → 3847.12] Get it?
[3847.12 → 3848.12] Get it?
[3848.12 → 3851.12] Aiden, when are you going to build a PC?
[3851.12 → 3852.12] I don't know.
[3852.12 → 3853.12] All the time?
[3853.12 → 3855.12] Thanks, Joseph.
[3855.12 → 3857.12] Thanks, Brad Schilling.
[3857.12 → 3861.12] Melissa, I need a wireless white mouse.
[3861.12 → 3865.12] Doesn't Logitech have like a G whatever the 3 or whatever white?
[3865.12 → 3868.12] We had them in the most recent Scrapyard Wars.
[3868.12 → 3869.12] Logitech.
[3869.12 → 3870.12] 303?
[3870.12 → 3871.12] 303 white?
[3871.12 → 3872.12] I think.
[3872.12 → 3875.12] G3, no.
[3875.12 → 3878.12] G305 I think is available in white.
[3878.12 → 3880.12] Is that what I said the first time?
[3880.12 → 3881.12] I don't remember.
[3881.12 → 3882.12] Yeah, the G305 is available in white.
[3882.12 → 3884.12] Get the G305 Light speed white.
[3884.12 → 3885.12] Yeah, there we go.
[3885.12 → 3886.12] Cool.
[3886.12 → 3887.12] That's the one you want.
[3887.12 → 3888.12] Okay.
[3888.12 → 3889.12] Not even too expensive considering it's a very good mouse.
[3889.12 → 3892.12] Yeah, it's a perfect mouse, and it's like 70 Canadian.
[3892.12 → 3893.12] So like what's that?
[3893.12 → 3894.12] Like 50, 55 US?
[3894.12 → 3895.12] Go check it out.
[3895.12 → 3899.12] Ilya, please read super chats like Paul and Kyle do.
[3899.12 → 3904.12] Frank, new Xbox is a crappier Corsair one but black.
[3904.12 → 3909.12] Actually, it's probably a pretty fast Corsair one given that it's using GPU technology that
[3909.12 → 3910.12] doesn't exist yet.
[3910.12 → 3911.12] It also looks pretty sharp.
[3911.12 → 3915.12] Nope says, at the DC Auto Show, kids next to me were cracking jokes about needs more RGB
[3915.12 → 3917.12] when they saw LEDs under the hood.
[3917.12 → 3920.12] Is that a Noctua at the Radian mimicking me?
[3920.12 → 3922.12] Thank you for that.
[3922.12 → 3926.12] BajaTrekGuy, I have an R5 2600, would 3600 be a good buy?
[3926.12 → 3929.12] For heck yeah, if you want more CPU performance.
[3929.12 → 3935.12] Cortex, how does it feel to be the most recurring phase second only to the host on the Game Awards?
[3935.12 → 3940.12] Did you see the clips of me during the Game Awards?
[3940.12 → 3942.12] I didn't know you had anything to do with the Game Awards.
[3942.12 → 3949.12] I never have before, and I might never again, but Samsung wanted someone to produce some clips
[3949.12 → 3952.12] talking about the benefits of their LED TVs for gaming.
[3952.12 → 3953.12] Okay.
[3953.12 → 3958.12] And they've actually got some perfect features, so like their auto low latency mode,
[3958.12 → 3964.12] low input lag, just HDR, blah blah blah, all the stuff that's like great for a great gaming experience.
[3964.12 → 3970.12] So I actually, I took all of their marketing materials, a lot of which was like,
[3970.12 → 3974.12] yeah, this isn't making it into three 30 second cuts, sorry.
[3974.12 → 3978.12] I just took out a bunch of stuff, and then we did, did I spit on you?
[3978.12 → 3979.12] Did I spit on you?
[3979.12 → 3980.12] A little bit, it's all good.
[3980.12 → 3983.12] So we shot them here in the studio, but we like, did it up nice.
[3983.12 → 3985.12] I wore a suit, still sandals.
[3985.12 → 3986.12] Okay, nice.
[3986.12 → 3988.12] I think there's one clip where you can see that I am definitely.
[3988.12 → 3990.12] Okay, so I saw that picture, alright.
[3990.12 → 3993.12] And then they ran the three clips, just like during the Game Awards,
[3993.12 → 3998.12] talking about Samsung LED TVs and the good gaming technology that they have in them.
[3998.12 → 4001.12] And so people were Memling it up.
[4001.12 → 4006.12] Like my Twitter, whoosh, exploded while those were going up.
[4006.12 → 4008.12] It was pretty cool.
[4008.12 → 4013.12] Even though it was just like, you know, pimping Samsung TVs,
[4013.12 → 4016.12] as opposed to having anything actually at all to do with the Game Awards.
[4016.12 → 4017.12] Well that's why I was surprised.
[4017.12 → 4021.12] It was like, why would you have anything to do with Game Awards?
[4021.12 → 4024.12] Michael says, if I knit you guys hats, would you wear them once on the show?
[4024.12 → 4027.12] Full disclaimer, I am terrible at knitting.
[4027.12 → 4029.12] I don't know, Michael.
[4029.12 → 4031.12] Not a good sale, right there.
[4031.12 → 4034.12] Hair Trigger, love seeing Lance and Luke working together, great dynamic shoutout.
[4034.12 → 4036.12] I guess you got it.
[4036.12 → 4039.12] Chris Darling, people, guys, if you're sending Super Chats now,
[4039.12 → 4041.12] we're probably not going to get to it.
[4041.12 → 4043.12] The time to send Super Chats was earlier in the show.
[4043.12 → 4044.12] Yeah.
[4044.12 → 4046.12] Love your vids, I have an HTC Five.
[4046.12 → 4049.12] What VR headset would you consider to be the best upgrade?
[4049.12 → 4056.12] I mean, honestly, the only upgrade from the Five, the only clear upgrade is an Index.
[4056.12 → 4058.12] Sorry.
[4058.12 → 4063.12] Five Pro, greater resolution, doesn't up the frame rate though.
[4063.12 → 4067.12] I tried pretty much all the different headsets.
[4067.12 → 4073.12] The Index was the first one that's floored me since like, pretty much originally trying VR headsets.
[4073.12 → 4074.12] Yeah.
[4074.12 → 4076.12] It's actually a very noticeable difference.
[4076.12 → 4079.12] I haven't actually tried the new HTC one.
[4079.12 → 4084.12] I reached out about getting a review sample and I just realized now that they said yes,
[4084.12 → 4086.12] but then just like never sent one.
[4086.12 → 4088.12] So, I don't have one of those.
[4088.12 → 4092.12] So, yeah, apparently the tracking sucks though.
[4092.12 → 4095.12] But I haven't tried it myself, so I can't really speak to it.
[4095.12 → 4096.12] Kind of ruins it for me.
[4096.12 → 4101.12] Seeker says, we're just going to skip over that the PS5 is a toilet seat.
[4101.12 → 4102.12] Yeah, for now.
[4102.12 → 4103.12] For now.
[4103.12 → 4104.12] Hair trigger.
[4104.12 → 4106.12] I blame various narcotics for that typo.
[4106.12 → 4108.12] He typed like instead of Luke.
[4108.12 → 4109.12] You just rolled over it.
[4109.12 → 4110.12] Yeah, yeah.
[4110.12 → 4111.12] I don't even, I don't read typos.
[4111.12 → 4113.12] It's kind of like how I don't see ads.
[4113.12 → 4114.12] Rationalizer.
[4114.12 → 4116.12] Bring the full abyss setup to LTX.
[4116.12 → 4117.12] That's a sweet idea.
[4117.12 → 4118.12] Yeah.
[4118.12 → 4119.12] We should totally do that.
[4119.12 → 4122.12] It's a $35,000 listening setup.
[4122.12 → 4124.12] Headphones are five grand.
[4124.12 → 4125.12] The DAC is like-
[4125.12 → 4126.12] Are they open?
[4126.12 → 4127.12] Five to eight grand.
[4127.12 → 4129.12] Because you'd need like a listening booth.
[4129.12 → 4130.12] Yeah, they're open backed.
[4130.12 → 4132.12] We would have to have some kind of-
[4132.12 → 4133.12] Yeah, we-
[4133.12 → 4135.12] Remember the Sennheiser booth that they had at CES that one year?
[4135.12 → 4139.12] I'm going to get back to you on that because this could be a great way to kill two birds with one stone.
[4139.12 → 4144.12] We've been wanting to build like a sound chamber for testing fans and stuff for a while.
[4144.12 → 4145.12] Cool.
[4145.12 → 4150.12] So if we could get someone to sponsor the booth and pay for us to build that chamber, and then we just bring it back to the studio when we're done.
[4150.12 → 4151.12] Nice.
[4151.12 → 4153.12] Vaughn, take a memo.
[4154.12 → 4155.12] Can we do that?
[4155.12 → 4157.12] The look there was perfect.
[4157.12 → 4158.12] Let Chad know.
[4164.12 → 4167.12] Reno says, Boxes have been PCs from the beginning.
[4167.12 → 4168.12] That's true.
[4168.12 → 4170.12] The original one was a Pentium 3.
[4170.12 → 4172.12] I think our point is they're just really accepting it now.
[4172.12 → 4174.12] Yeah, they're just like definitely actually PCs.
[4174.12 → 4175.12] Yeah.
[4175.12 → 4178.12] Karsten says, I'm in Thailand for vacation.
[4178.12 → 4182.12] Yesterday the translator recognized my LTT shirt and asked me about it.
[4182.12 → 4183.12] How cool is that?
[4183.12 → 4184.12] Very cool.
[4184.12 → 4185.12] Pretty sweet.
[4185.12 → 4189.12] Scooby, do you guys think you will receive either of the new consoles for a sponsored video?
[4189.12 → 4190.12] Probably not sponsored.
[4190.12 → 4196.12] But both Sony and Microsoft have had us on their seeding list for the last couple of console launches.
[4196.12 → 4197.12] PS4, PS4 Pro.
[4197.12 → 4202.12] I also think, like not just mine, but I think our console content has actually been pretty solid.
[4202.12 → 4204.12] Yeah, I think it's been solid.
[4204.12 → 4207.12] Like our Switch Lite video I was really happy with.
[4207.12 → 4208.12] I thought we covered it really well.
[4208.12 → 4210.12] Yeah, Nintendo even supports us too.
[4210.12 → 4211.12] So they've been pretty good about it.
[4211.12 → 4213.12] We got our Switch Lite pretty late.
[4213.12 → 4216.12] Their Canadian division is a little slow.
[4216.12 → 4217.12] It's always like that.
[4217.12 → 4218.12] Yeah.
[4218.12 → 4222.12] Alexander, thanks for the great Canadian content.
[4222.12 → 4224.12] Appreciate you too, family.
[4224.12 → 4226.12] R on the Black Fox, Air on the Black Fox.
[4226.12 → 4229.12] Normally I catch a GOD or start watching from the beginning when you're 40 minutes in.
[4229.12 → 4232.12] Thanks for all the content and encouraging me to build my first PCs.
[4232.12 → 4234.12] I'm three years ago, stay awesome.
[4234.12 → 4238.12] East Coast Gamers says, here's some Canadian love from Halifax.
[4238.12 → 4240.12] A hundred Canadian dollars.
[4240.12 → 4241.12] WTF?
[4241.12 → 4242.12] Look up to you as a YouTuber.
[4242.12 → 4243.12] Hope you have a Merry Christmas.
[4243.12 → 4244.12] Thank you.
[4244.12 → 4245.12] Appreciate it.
[4245.12 → 4248.12] Gap Tooth Granny.
[4248.12 → 4250.12] Just upgraded to Ry zen.
[4250.12 → 4252.12] Get an RTX card now or wait?
[4252.12 → 4256.12] I would probably just go for it now, honestly.
[4256.12 → 4260.12] Like, I mean, next gen, there's going to be like a 2080 Ti Super.
[4260.12 → 4263.12] That's in the rumour mill, but like actually next gen, next gen.
[4263.12 → 4265.12] I don't think it's coming probably till Q2 next year.
[4265.12 → 4266.12] Don't quote me on that.
[4266.12 → 4267.12] It might be sooner.
[4267.12 → 4268.12] You never know.
[4268.12 → 4273.12] Liam says, why don't you come down to Bellingham for Scrapyard Wars?
[4273.12 → 4276.12] Ah, it's not really about that.
[4276.12 → 4278.12] It's just like, it's more hassle for very little benefit.
[4278.12 → 4281.12] America and Canada are not that different.
[4281.12 → 4285.12] If we were going to do like a crazy location Scrapyard Wars, it wouldn't be in the States.
[4285.12 → 4289.12] Yeah, we've done one in the States and it really wasn't that weird.
[4289.12 → 4292.12] I also just don't know if we're going to do another one at this point.
[4292.12 → 4299.12] You know, some of it was we made some mistakes this time around, but some of it I think people might just be done with the format.
[4299.12 → 4303.12] Tommy Gunn says, I was pissed about your 5G video.
[4303.12 → 4308.12] I'm in the US, T-Mobile sinks millions into 5G and in Germany their home market they do nothing.
[4308.12 → 4310.12] No 5G, no fibre.
[4310.12 → 4313.12] And the state paid them taxpayer money to do so.
[4313.12 → 4318.12] Now, I don't actually know how related T-Mobile, US and Germany are.
[4319.12 → 4320.12] No idea.
[4320.12 → 4321.12] Do you? I'm not sure.
[4321.12 → 4322.12] They're D Telecom over there, aren't they?
[4322.12 → 4323.12] I can't remember.
[4323.12 → 4327.12] I can't remember exactly how it works over there, but that's brutal.
[4327.12 → 4328.12] Sorry to hear that.
[4328.12 → 4331.12] I was actually really disappointed in a lot of the comments on the T-Mobile video.
[4331.12 → 4342.12] I get that people were upset it was sponsored or whatever else, but there were so many people that said things that I didn't cover in the video, except that I did and were definitely in the video.
[4342.12 → 4347.12] They were like, well, you didn't even mention that unless you use millimetre wave 5G is not like crazy fast.
[4347.12 → 4350.12] I watched for 15 seconds.
[4350.12 → 4351.12] Yeah.
[4351.12 → 4352.12] And you didn't say it.
[4352.12 → 4353.12] And I'm outraged.
[4353.12 → 4354.12] Yes.
[4354.12 → 4358.12] So yes, it was sponsored by T-Mobile, but the thing is, is like, we were up front.
[4358.12 → 4359.12] It's sponsored by T-Mobile.
[4359.12 → 4361.12] Like, what do you want us to do?
[4361.12 → 4367.12] Would you rather we upload some video talking about T-Mobile where we don't disclose that it's sponsored by T-Mobile?
[4367.12 → 4369.12] What do you guys want from us?
[4371.12 → 4373.12] And yeah, they're D Telecom over there.
[4373.12 → 4377.12] Like, and like, how else was I going to be going down there to check that out?
[4377.12 → 4381.12] Like, I don't just fly to New York for no reason, unfortunately.
[4384.12 → 4386.12] I think your wife wants you to go.
[4386.12 → 4387.12] Oh yeah.
[4387.12 → 4388.12] I think I need to go.
[4388.12 → 4389.12] Okay.
[4389.12 → 4390.12] There were a couple other crazy super chats.
[4390.12 → 4394.12] Brandon asks, did you wear shoes for the Samsung videos?
[4394.12 → 4395.12] No.
[4395.12 → 4399.12] T says, I have enjoyed watching since NCI, learned how to build computers.
[4399.12 → 4401.12] Now I own and operate a server hosting service.
[4401.12 → 4402.12] Well, that's cool.
[4402.12 → 4403.12] Sweet.
[4403.12 → 4404.12] I don't know what that is.
[4404.12 → 4405.12] Sir myself.
[4405.12 → 4409.12] Hey guys, how about a bundled offer for the Beta Squad shirt and a month or two of Float plane membership?
[4409.12 → 4412.12] Wow, we'd have to link together the backend systems of those two things.
[4412.12 → 4416.12] If they had, this is not the cleanest thing ever.
[4416.12 → 4421.12] If they had accounts already, and we were able to gather their emails, we could do it pretty easily.
[4421.12 → 4422.12] Okay.
[4422.12 → 4424.12] But they'd have to like, have accounts already.
[4424.12 → 4426.12] No promises.
[4426.12 → 4427.12] No promises.
[4427.12 → 4431.12] Jason Johansson says, bought merch, had to work out of town, couldn't pick it up at Canada Post.
[4431.12 → 4433.12] What happens to it after the fact?
[4433.12 → 4435.12] Oh man.
[4435.12 → 4440.12] I guess you'd have to contact Canada Post about that.
[4440.12 → 4443.12] It might end up back at us at some point.
[4443.12 → 4444.12] Oh.
[4444.12 → 4445.12] And I have no idea how that works.
[4445.12 → 4447.12] Email float, excuse the Float plane.
[4447.12 → 4450.12] Email the merch store support on LTTstore.com.
[4450.12 → 4455.12] Mr. Idnetguy2004 sent $200.
[4455.12 → 4456.12] I'm a huge fan.
[4456.12 → 4458.12] Emailed you of my setup.
[4458.12 → 4459.12] Would love to meet you someday.
[4459.12 → 4461.12] Head to LTX, yo!
[4461.12 → 4463.12] You're spending money on Super Chats.
[4463.12 → 4465.12] You have to spend that money on a plane ticket!
[4466.12 → 4467.12] Anyway, yeah.
[4467.12 → 4470.12] Thanks for the Super Chats anyway though.
[4470.12 → 4472.12] But yeah, see you at LTX.
[4472.12 → 4473.12] Holy.
[4473.12 → 4475.12] I mentioned you on Twitter of my setup.
[4475.12 → 4477.12] Oh man, I get so many mentions on Twitter dude.
[4477.12 → 4480.12] Like, it's a miracle that I see any of them at all.
[4480.12 → 4481.12] But come to LTX.
[4481.12 → 4482.12] Yeah.
[4482.12 → 4483.12] Bring your phone.
[4483.12 → 4484.12] Show me a picture of your setup.
[4484.12 → 4485.12] Yeah.
[4485.12 → 4486.12] Love to see it.
[4486.12 → 4487.12] Alright.
[4487.12 → 4489.12] Thanks guys for tuning into the WAN Show.
[4489.12 → 4490.12] We'll see you again next week.
[4490.12 → 4492.12] Same bad time, same bad channel.
[4492.12 → 4493.12] 1300 viewers, you guys are nuts.
[4493.12 → 4495.12] Thank you so much.
[4495.12 → 4496.12] Really appreciate you all.
[4497.12 → 4498.12] Okay, so how do I end this?
[4498.12 → 4499.12] Right.
[4499.12 → 4501.12] Okay, so on YouTube I click end stream.
[4501.12 → 4502.12] Bye YouTube!
[4504.12 → 4505.12] Are you sure you want to end it?
[4505.12 → 4506.12] Yes.
