[0.00 --> 3.48]  Do we call this stuff out?
[4.08 --> 5.72]  Hey there, ladies and gentlemen.
[5.94 --> 6.38]  Hey!
[6.80 --> 8.26]  Welcome to the WAN show.
[8.48 --> 9.90]  It's a show.
[10.26 --> 14.80]  Riley and I were just in the middle of discussing what you do on the WAN show
[14.80 --> 16.28]  because he hasn't been on it in a while.
[17.02 --> 20.60]  Well, I was on it actually two or three weeks ago.
[20.70 --> 21.06]  Oh, were you?
[21.06 --> 22.00]  But I screwed it up.
[22.70 --> 23.80]  You screwed it up?
[23.86 --> 26.00]  I didn't click the...
[26.00 --> 27.00]  And that was me.
[27.60 --> 28.04]  Yes.
[28.10 --> 28.74]  That's my fault.
[28.74 --> 30.12]  Ah, yes.
[30.30 --> 30.90]  Was that?
[31.02 --> 31.10]  No.
[31.12 --> 31.84]  He didn't know that.
[32.04 --> 33.18]  I didn't know it was you.
[33.36 --> 34.80]  I knew that a thing went wrong.
[34.86 --> 35.26]  Oh, wow.
[35.42 --> 37.50]  My co-workers protected me.
[37.52 --> 42.20]  So now I'm going to have to add WAN show to the list of things that we can't trust Riley
[42.20 --> 45.18]  with along with RTX 2080 reviews.
[45.52 --> 46.88]  You know what you can trust me with?
[48.72 --> 49.80]  New apparel.
[49.96 --> 51.20]  Pimping the merch.
[51.52 --> 51.92]  Hey!
[52.36 --> 52.86]  Love it.
[52.86 --> 57.84]  So I've actually got our oldest merch and then Riley's decked out in our newest stuff.
[57.84 --> 58.92]  We can talk about that later.
[59.04 --> 59.30]  Later.
[59.58 --> 62.84]  Anyway, we've got a bunch of great topics for you guys today.
[62.96 --> 66.78]  We're going to be talking about the new A-Core Core i9 MacBook Pro.
[67.16 --> 71.50]  Of course, I have some sort of mixed thoughts on this machine.
[71.62 --> 76.70]  We've yet to get one in the office, but I've been following the latest developments pretty
[76.70 --> 77.16]  closely.
[77.16 --> 83.04]  We're also going to be talking about YouTube's controversial move to change the subscriber
[83.04 --> 83.46]  counter.
[83.62 --> 87.40]  So it's harder to tell just how many subscribers a channel has.
[87.56 --> 88.24]  What else we got?
[88.68 --> 91.66]  We got NVIDIA Super something.
[93.38 --> 95.30]  They teased something on social media.
[95.40 --> 96.90]  They released a YouTube video.
[97.00 --> 98.62]  I don't even know if I want to give them attention for that kind of nonsense.
[98.62 --> 98.90]  Okay.
[99.04 --> 100.62]  We're not going to talk about that.
[100.62 --> 101.38]  We'll talk about it.
[101.38 --> 101.70]  At all.
[101.78 --> 102.42]  We'll talk about it.
[102.44 --> 105.74]  It's just going to be me ranting angrily instead of actually speculating.
[105.76 --> 106.60]  Well, you can speculate.
[106.68 --> 107.20]  I can't wait.
[107.52 --> 107.72]  All right.
[107.74 --> 108.30]  What else we got?
[108.72 --> 111.00]  Oh, well, we got the Huawei nonsense.
[111.52 --> 112.12]  Oh, good.
[112.30 --> 113.66]  We could talk about that a little bit.
[113.66 --> 114.26]  We'll talk about that later.
[114.48 --> 115.20]  We got 5G.
[116.16 --> 117.00]  So many things.
[117.38 --> 118.92]  And first, but first, we got the intro.
[119.10 --> 119.52]  See you later.
[127.66 --> 128.82]  There's music here?
[129.02 --> 129.28]  Yeah.
[129.28 --> 133.78]  I always, I never know because you play the intro and it's like, do we keep talking?
[134.04 --> 135.40]  They can hear us talking right now.
[135.44 --> 135.66]  Oh, yeah.
[135.70 --> 137.00]  They can hear us talking over the middle.
[137.88 --> 141.44]  It's just, it's one of those things that we could fix, but we didn't.
[142.36 --> 142.76]  Corsair.
[143.48 --> 144.12]  Wait, what?
[144.68 --> 145.08]  Squarespace.
[145.58 --> 145.70]  Squarespace.
[147.00 --> 147.32]  Madrina.
[147.48 --> 148.14]  Madrina's coffee.
[148.16 --> 149.40]  Oh, hey, Madrina's is a sponsor.
[150.46 --> 152.32]  Well, they can't see you drinking it like that.
[152.50 --> 154.34]  Well, that's why I tried to make it extra loud.
[155.48 --> 156.72]  All right, guys.
[156.72 --> 160.96]  So why don't we jump right into our, oh, shoot.
[161.06 --> 164.70]  I think I left the title wrong on float plane.
[164.82 --> 165.54]  Poor float plane.
[165.98 --> 166.50]  Never mind.
[166.82 --> 167.18]  Never mind.
[167.26 --> 167.76]  No, it's great.
[167.76 --> 168.62]  I just needed to refresh the tab.
[168.86 --> 169.64]  Freaking awesome.
[169.68 --> 170.36]  Love you so much.
[170.36 --> 171.48]  All right.
[171.64 --> 172.86]  Oh, oh, wow.
[173.16 --> 173.30]  Oh.
[173.70 --> 178.34]  It is so terrible that Luke isn't here today.
[178.40 --> 178.86]  Oh, no.
[178.86 --> 179.14]  No, no.
[179.26 --> 182.70]  I mean, it's, wow, that came across wrong.
[183.32 --> 186.52]  We're adding co-host the WAN show with Linus to the things, right?
[186.74 --> 187.08]  Yeah, yeah.
[187.08 --> 191.54]  So the reference I'm making there, guys, is on Riley's first WAN show, I made a joke that
[191.54 --> 195.14]  he wasn't qualified to review the RTX 2080.
[195.30 --> 197.14]  And people got upset because it wasn't a joke.
[197.24 --> 197.64]  He's not.
[197.84 --> 201.14]  And the difference is that I am qualified to review it badly.
[201.46 --> 202.82]  So if you don't want that.
[203.34 --> 206.62]  Look, everyone here has their different specialties.
[207.00 --> 208.34]  Anthony's our GPU guy.
[208.56 --> 210.44]  He's more qualified than either of us.
[210.48 --> 211.54]  I was just poking fun at Riley.
[211.66 --> 213.32]  So that's the reference I'm making here.
[213.32 --> 216.42]  Maybe we just shouldn't, you shouldn't just, we shouldn't even address that.
[216.66 --> 222.06]  But Riley, Riley, the thing that you're not qualified to talk about compared to my usual
[222.06 --> 231.48]  co-host is actually the latest by creators for creators video streaming service that popped
[231.48 --> 232.44]  up on the internet.
[234.18 --> 235.62]  Have I heard about this?
[236.04 --> 236.96]  I doubt it.
[237.04 --> 240.78]  It actually, it happened pretty quietly.
[240.78 --> 243.96]  And I'm just, I'm trying to remember what it's called right now.
[244.04 --> 245.06]  Ah, yes, here we go.
[245.14 --> 245.56]  Here we go.
[246.04 --> 250.52]  So I really, I wish Luke was here because we would have a lot to say about this.
[250.58 --> 251.44]  But guess what?
[251.82 --> 257.18]  There is another creator created video service out there now.
[257.24 --> 261.44]  So they've got a handful of creators, including MinutePhysics, SciShow.
[262.14 --> 263.44]  Who else is on here?
[263.54 --> 264.56]  LowSpecGamer is on there.
[264.56 --> 265.44]  These guys are all on it?
[265.74 --> 267.12]  Yeah, these guys are all on it.
[267.18 --> 267.40]  Oh, dang.
[267.82 --> 269.00]  This isn't actually.
[269.14 --> 270.28]  So we have a new arch enemy.
[270.86 --> 272.16]  Oh, no, I wouldn't.
[272.24 --> 273.30]  I wouldn't say that at all.
[273.40 --> 279.16]  Like their shtick is honestly so different from Floatplane that it, I couldn't be, I couldn't
[279.16 --> 280.36]  be less concerned about it.
[280.42 --> 280.86]  Like it's.
[281.20 --> 285.46]  When, when do we launch a concentrated strike?
[285.70 --> 287.04]  A concentrated strike?
[288.08 --> 290.22]  When do we send the strike force?
[290.22 --> 292.72]  Just kidding.
[293.08 --> 294.28]  Love all of you guys.
[294.28 --> 301.88]  So their jam is that it's mostly like science and intellectual creators.
[302.68 --> 303.56]  Unlike us.
[303.98 --> 308.22]  I'm kind of thinking that our strike force probably doesn't have to be that hardcore.
[308.56 --> 308.98]  Oh.
[309.68 --> 310.72]  I'm generalizing.
[310.72 --> 311.02]  That's not nice.
[311.02 --> 311.62]  I'm generalizing.
[311.74 --> 311.98]  I shouldn't.
[311.98 --> 313.16]  We would have the gadgets.
[313.32 --> 314.12]  I shouldn't generalize.
[314.12 --> 317.80]  They're just like sitting there in coffee shops thinking about like the questions of
[317.80 --> 322.28]  the universe and we're like, you know, building weapons.
[322.46 --> 325.10]  I don't think we have much capacity to build weapons either.
[325.16 --> 330.04]  In fact, I would give them more weapon building street cred than us for sure.
[330.08 --> 330.28]  Yeah, maybe.
[330.44 --> 330.62]  Maybe.
[330.76 --> 331.22]  Okay, look.
[331.30 --> 332.20]  I sure wish this was authentic.
[332.20 --> 336.30]  I turned it right from the get-go into something where they have to be enemies.
[336.40 --> 338.02]  We can be friends, you know?
[339.28 --> 340.76]  This is the problem.
[340.96 --> 341.40]  What are you doing?
[341.40 --> 345.66]  This is the problem with not just having proper USB ports on laptops.
[346.44 --> 346.90]  Oh, right.
[346.96 --> 347.76]  You got an adapter.
[347.92 --> 348.68]  You got a dongle.
[348.78 --> 350.72]  Yeah, I think this dongle hub is broken.
[350.72 --> 352.44]  You're trying to live that dongle life right now.
[352.58 --> 354.20]  I hate that dongle life.
[355.28 --> 356.96]  Back in a moment, ladies and gentlemen.
[356.96 --> 362.06]  And this, in addition to the fact that eight cores is too much, not, well, it's not too
[362.06 --> 362.26]  much.
[362.30 --> 363.72]  It's too much for an Apple laptop.
[364.60 --> 368.62]  This is also why you don't buy the Apple MacBook Pro because they don't have enough USB ports.
[368.64 --> 369.44]  All right, we'll talk about that.
[369.46 --> 370.46]  We'll talk about that later.
[370.58 --> 371.16]  I'm upset.
[372.40 --> 372.80]  Okay.
[373.38 --> 373.88]  Here we go.
[373.94 --> 374.68]  Let's try this again.
[376.00 --> 378.00]  Freaking stupid butt.
[379.32 --> 379.88]  There it goes.
[379.98 --> 380.88]  Dongle is rubbish.
[381.02 --> 381.52]  You're right.
[381.68 --> 382.68]  Back 729.
[383.10 --> 383.82]  This dongle is bad.
[383.84 --> 384.38]  Hey, Colton.
[384.60 --> 385.00]  What's up?
[385.02 --> 385.92]  Got a bad dongle.
[385.92 --> 387.20]  Yeah, show me your dongle.
[387.34 --> 388.36]  Bad dongle.
[388.80 --> 389.88]  E-waste pile.
[390.44 --> 391.00]  E-waste pile.
[391.16 --> 393.20]  Oh, he stepped on it.
[393.20 --> 393.72]  Yeah, he did.
[394.10 --> 395.98]  I mean, I wouldn't use the word stomp.
[396.18 --> 397.74]  Colton's an absolute mad lad.
[397.76 --> 401.02]  I definitely wouldn't use the word crush, but step.
[401.18 --> 401.90]  Step, yes.
[404.04 --> 404.90]  Boom, roasted.
[407.72 --> 408.92]  All right, so.
[409.20 --> 411.14]  Oh, what is it?
[411.70 --> 412.28]  Hold on a second.
[412.28 --> 414.02]  You know, I just really want to talk about.
[414.62 --> 415.22]  Did they?
[415.92 --> 417.38]  You're trying to log in?
[417.48 --> 417.98]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[417.98 --> 418.48]  I'm logging in.
[418.48 --> 421.84]  You're trying to log in to your competitor site and they deleted your account.
[421.98 --> 422.84]  No, no.
[422.96 --> 423.26]  I wouldn't.
[423.66 --> 424.06]  Honestly.
[424.26 --> 425.62]  Okay, so speaking honestly.
[425.82 --> 425.98]  Yeah.
[426.06 --> 428.38]  No, I do not consider this a competitor.
[428.92 --> 431.86]  And I don't mean that in like a casting shade way.
[431.86 --> 432.64]  They'll never be at our level.
[432.64 --> 435.58]  I just mean that it's really, really different from what we're doing.
[435.74 --> 437.34]  So I signed up for a trial account.
[437.42 --> 438.42]  They have a seven-day trial.
[438.90 --> 441.78]  And I was obviously really curious.
[441.94 --> 442.22]  Hold on.
[442.26 --> 443.74]  Let me just make sure that this is muted.
[443.90 --> 444.22]  Yeah, good.
[444.22 --> 448.56]  I was obviously really curious to see how they've got it set up.
[448.68 --> 450.32]  Like what's their shtick.
[450.58 --> 450.70]  Right.
[450.96 --> 454.68]  So it looks like one of the things that they're using to stand out.
[454.82 --> 456.82]  So you can really see from the categories.
[457.74 --> 458.34]  Explainers.
[458.66 --> 459.10]  History.
[459.86 --> 460.38]  Music.
[460.56 --> 461.28]  Science and engineering.
[461.46 --> 461.94]  Technology.
[462.08 --> 462.32]  Writing.
[462.48 --> 466.88]  Like they're really focused on like kind of STEM categories.
[467.06 --> 467.24]  Right.
[467.24 --> 469.84]  And then also music and gaming and film and TV.
[470.16 --> 470.54]  Oh, okay.
[471.72 --> 473.50]  Yeah, this would be good to have Luke here for this.
[473.66 --> 475.30]  And then they've also got originals.
[476.18 --> 478.46]  So Grand Test Auto has done some originals.
[478.60 --> 480.40]  Isaac Arthur has done some originals.
[480.60 --> 482.16]  Polyphonic has done some originals.
[482.64 --> 484.00]  I mean, they just launched.
[484.22 --> 488.76]  So honestly, there's not a ton going on right now.
[489.66 --> 492.10]  Touchscreen works to scroll through this deal though.
[492.24 --> 493.34]  So that's pretty cool.
[493.90 --> 495.00]  I can do that.
[495.10 --> 495.20]  See?
[495.44 --> 495.66]  Huh.
[495.66 --> 496.30]  Check that out.
[497.24 --> 498.88]  Let me just see.
[498.98 --> 499.70]  Yeah, CGP Grey.
[499.88 --> 501.02]  We'll go ahead and click on that.
[501.32 --> 506.30]  So you can see people are uploading some of their back catalog.
[506.50 --> 508.38]  But it seems to be right now mostly.
[509.04 --> 509.76]  Oh, interesting.
[509.98 --> 510.14]  Okay.
[510.22 --> 516.48]  So I do know that CGP Grey has some involvement with the project.
[516.68 --> 519.56]  He appears to be listed as a...
[519.56 --> 521.84]  I don't want to get the terminology wrong.
[522.42 --> 525.32]  I want to say co-founder.
[525.32 --> 526.92]  One of the big honchos.
[527.24 --> 529.60]  One of the big cheeses.
[529.74 --> 530.22]  What is this?
[530.74 --> 531.42]  Oh, no, no, no.
[531.42 --> 532.76]  I don't want contact us.
[532.80 --> 533.60]  I want about us.
[534.54 --> 535.30]  Oh, dang it.
[535.52 --> 536.26]  Yeah, I got it.
[536.40 --> 536.72]  Cookies.
[536.96 --> 537.04]  I know.
[537.04 --> 539.68]  Send them a message that we're talking about them right now.
[539.74 --> 540.10]  Here we go.
[540.16 --> 540.50]  Here we go.
[540.56 --> 541.08]  Hold on a second.
[541.08 --> 542.22]  Yes.
[542.22 --> 543.20]  Community co-founded.
[543.44 --> 543.64]  Yes.
[543.76 --> 547.06]  Co-founded by Dave Wiska, CGP Grey, and Philip Detmer.
[547.64 --> 552.98]  So you can see here that he's actually got videos on here that...
[552.98 --> 554.68]  This says eight years ago, though.
[554.68 --> 556.52]  There's no way they were working on this eight years ago.
[556.52 --> 561.50]  So I had seen one from him that said a year ago, and that was the oldest video that I'd seen.
[561.70 --> 570.58]  But I think that might just be an older video of his that maybe is from, like, I don't know, Patreon or something like that.
[570.58 --> 570.64]  Right.
[570.92 --> 571.64]  Oh, but...
[571.64 --> 573.52]  And maybe you can manually key in a date.
[573.64 --> 574.86]  These are all exclusives?
[574.92 --> 575.44]  Is that what you're saying?
[576.08 --> 576.20]  No.
[576.20 --> 577.44]  I don't know exactly what they are.
[577.90 --> 580.60]  So I've only spent a few minutes poking around.
[581.00 --> 583.86]  I'm not going to actually play any of the content because...
[583.86 --> 584.72]  We don't want to...
[584.72 --> 586.06]  Guys, go get your own trial.
[586.06 --> 586.98]  Go get your own trial.
[587.20 --> 589.68]  Yeah, like, I'm not trying to get in trouble or anything here.
[590.16 --> 595.52]  But basically, these guys are taking a completely different approach.
[595.62 --> 599.68]  So they're doing $5 a month that subscribes you to the entire site,
[599.68 --> 606.54]  whereas for us, we evaluated the model of a per-site subscription
[606.54 --> 610.72]  and couldn't really find a way to make that make sense.
[611.02 --> 611.12]  Right.
[611.34 --> 613.68]  So maybe they've...
[613.68 --> 616.76]  Obviously, we're going to be looking further into what exactly they're doing.
[617.12 --> 622.20]  So maybe they've figured out something that we haven't, but hopefully that goes really well.
[622.74 --> 627.66]  So we're doing a per-creator subscription, more like what someone like a Patreon is doing.
[629.68 --> 633.34]  And their other thing is that they're going invite only.
[633.66 --> 638.92]  So it's supposed to be like a curated list of creators that are kind of educational.
[639.12 --> 644.46]  And this actually ties in really well with a video that Veritasium released earlier this week
[644.46 --> 649.50]  talking about the changes in the YouTube algorithm and how they affect creators.
[649.54 --> 650.52]  That was a really good video.
[650.52 --> 651.48]  Did you watch it?
[651.52 --> 651.64]  Yeah.
[651.86 --> 652.24]  Oh, good.
[652.34 --> 655.40]  That's good because it was in the writer's meeting notes as required viewing.
[655.70 --> 657.86]  I watched it before you told us to watch it.
[657.92 --> 658.28]  Did you?
[658.38 --> 658.78]  Actually.
[659.18 --> 659.62]  Excellent.
[660.00 --> 660.82]  Ahead of the curve.
[660.82 --> 667.86]  So as a recap, Derek from Veritasium basically made a viral video, super viral, 33 million
[667.86 --> 669.32]  views or something crazy like that.
[669.60 --> 678.84]  And then a couple of days later did a postmortem on why and how that video went viral and how
[678.84 --> 687.90]  YouTube's algorithmic, I don't want to call it favoritism, but how YouTube's algorithmic tendencies
[687.90 --> 693.24]  tend to be towards videos that just get an excellent click-through ratio.
[693.24 --> 695.12]  Have a lot of tiny balls in the thumbnail.
[695.48 --> 695.78]  Yeah.
[695.78 --> 704.30]  Or just anything else that's very enticing in the thumbnail because at the end of the
[704.30 --> 710.30]  day, YouTube wants to keep people watching on the site as often as possible and for as
[710.30 --> 711.12]  long as possible.
[711.44 --> 714.12]  That's how Google makes money through YouTube.
[714.44 --> 717.34]  The more ads you watch, so much the better.
[717.96 --> 721.08]  So he kind of went, so here's the thing.
[721.08 --> 727.88]  Your more niche content or your kind of more dry, science-y, boring, explain-y content that
[727.88 --> 733.66]  gets 4% of the people who see an impression for it to click on it is just not going to
[733.66 --> 741.44]  get that prime real estate the way that something more sensational that gets 25% of the people
[741.44 --> 742.70]  to click on it will.
[743.20 --> 743.54]  Right.
[743.74 --> 745.50]  And you can't blame YouTube for that.
[745.82 --> 747.74]  They want people to watch videos.
[747.74 --> 752.26]  That's the way that the algorithm decides is the best way to serve people the content
[752.26 --> 753.48]  that they want to watch.
[753.60 --> 761.38]  But it still means that for people who are not able or not willing to engage in the whole,
[762.56 --> 768.34]  you know, we filled our backyard with Thai Beanie Babies or whatever.
[768.64 --> 769.12]  Like that kind.
[769.32 --> 770.66]  Which is very interesting.
[770.74 --> 772.54]  A dump truck of Thai Beanie Babies.
[772.60 --> 773.96]  Yeah, from a scientific perspective.
[774.12 --> 774.98]  Yes, very scientific.
[774.98 --> 777.62]  How does the, you know, the ragdoll physics and...
[777.62 --> 783.88]  So people like that are looking for a way out of the algorithm.
[783.88 --> 790.00]  And one of the things that WatchNebula.com says is there's no algorithm.
[790.68 --> 792.98]  And that makes sense given that this is...
[792.98 --> 799.52]  Yeah, given that this is like a curated list of supposed to be educational or intellectual creators
[799.52 --> 801.98]  for sort of a...
[801.98 --> 803.22]  I don't know.
[803.32 --> 805.14]  Whatever kind of audience would want that sort of thing.
[805.14 --> 806.44]  They're anti-algorithm.
[806.60 --> 806.86]  Yes.
[806.94 --> 808.36]  They're anti-algorithm.
[808.76 --> 812.54]  I mean, the cold hard truth is that even if they wanted an algorithm, that's a lot of R&D.
[812.70 --> 813.22]  That's true.
[813.72 --> 814.58]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[814.60 --> 815.56]  They're like, we're doing it.
[815.62 --> 816.26]  It's a choice.
[816.46 --> 816.72]  Okay?
[816.84 --> 818.00]  We could have had an algorithm.
[818.30 --> 818.88]  It's easy.
[818.96 --> 819.66]  We could have done it.
[819.66 --> 824.42]  I mean, yeah, it's one of those things where Floatplane is also anti-algorithm the way that
[824.42 --> 824.88]  we see it.
[824.94 --> 825.90]  A creator's page.
[826.36 --> 826.56]  Right.
[826.64 --> 827.72]  That's their page.
[827.88 --> 830.48]  That's not our page to advertise other creators.
[830.84 --> 832.98]  Especially because on Floatplane, you're paying per creator.
[833.10 --> 835.26]  So it's not like you'd be able to watch that other creator anyway.
[835.38 --> 835.76]  Exactly.
[837.06 --> 841.78]  But also, the cold hard truth is that even if Floatplane wanted to build a recommended
[841.78 --> 847.84]  algorithm, we would be a decade away from anything approaching the sophistication of
[847.84 --> 849.34]  what someone like a YouTube is doing.
[849.34 --> 850.74]  I could start working on that right now.
[851.16 --> 851.98]  You got this?
[852.18 --> 852.42]  Yeah.
[853.12 --> 853.70]  It's no problem.
[855.62 --> 858.28]  I've watched the YouTube trending page a bunch.
[858.36 --> 859.10]  I know how it works.
[860.72 --> 865.50]  So 225 Perfect says, Patreon support helps to bypass the algorithm at least somewhat.
[866.12 --> 870.36]  That may be the case, but Patreon is always going to be limited.
[870.44 --> 871.08]  Well, not always.
[871.18 --> 872.16]  I mean, they could fix it, I guess.
[872.16 --> 874.96]  But for now, they're limited in one key way.
[875.10 --> 879.76]  They don't have a way to economically serve video.
[879.98 --> 885.76]  They don't have a way to economically serve video on their site.
[885.82 --> 887.38]  So they're never going to be a one-stop shop.
[887.74 --> 887.80]  Right.
[887.80 --> 890.10]  And that was what we identified for Floatplane.
[890.50 --> 891.40]  And that's what the...
[892.18 --> 892.96]  I keep forgetting names.
[892.96 --> 894.96]  Combine Patreon and a video platform.
[894.96 --> 899.82]  That's what the Standard Shows team seems to have identified for WatchNebula.com.
[899.96 --> 900.52]  I see.
[900.52 --> 906.96]  Where you're going to want a way to both engage with the creator and support them and actually
[906.96 --> 909.84]  consume the content in one place.
[911.42 --> 914.26]  So for my part, I wish them the best of luck.
[914.44 --> 918.02]  I think that there is a ton of room for alternate video platforms.
[918.64 --> 919.52]  I think that...
[920.06 --> 923.32]  I mean, I also have concerns about fragmentation.
[924.16 --> 928.22]  I think that's definitely something that stands to become a problem.
[928.22 --> 930.66]  If this and Floatplane...
[930.66 --> 931.26]  There's a million...
[931.26 --> 933.48]  And the one Jordan Peterson is allegedly working on.
[934.42 --> 934.94]  And like...
[934.94 --> 938.76]  If there's a bunch of people who see Floatplane and they're like, we should do that.
[939.44 --> 940.64]  You know, that's a problem.
[940.76 --> 942.48]  But at least they saw that we were first.
[944.80 --> 945.50]  Are we?
[945.88 --> 948.44]  Because it looks like they've launched before we formally launched.
[948.82 --> 949.30]  Wowee!
[949.58 --> 951.72]  You can go sign up for Floatplane right now.
[951.86 --> 952.50]  That is true.
[952.60 --> 953.02]  That is true.
[953.02 --> 953.54]  You can.
[953.90 --> 954.10]  Yeah.
[954.26 --> 955.02]  So I don't...
[955.02 --> 956.40]  I don't know.
[956.40 --> 956.88]  Yeah.
[956.98 --> 958.14]  It's too bad, Luke's here.
[958.32 --> 958.72]  Not here.
[958.80 --> 959.80]  Because he could probably...
[959.80 --> 963.02]  He'd probably be even more angry than I am right now.
[963.10 --> 963.32]  No.
[963.44 --> 963.60]  No.
[963.64 --> 964.74]  I've talked to him about it already today.
[964.74 --> 966.50]  And I'm really mad.
[968.44 --> 970.76]  Why are you so determined to be mad about this?
[972.02 --> 973.12]  That's just my instinct.
[973.70 --> 974.70]  I get defensive.
[974.84 --> 975.00]  You know?
[975.02 --> 975.86]  This is my tribe.
[976.58 --> 976.82]  Yeah.
[976.96 --> 977.20]  No.
[977.32 --> 978.00]  It's...
[978.00 --> 980.42]  You better watch it, guys.
[981.70 --> 982.06]  Yeah.
[982.14 --> 982.30]  No.
[982.36 --> 983.24]  It's a non-issue.
[983.24 --> 984.24]  I mean, they're...
[984.24 --> 984.66]  Okay.
[984.74 --> 985.88]  The tech is really different.
[985.88 --> 988.28]  So they're using Amazon AWS for their back end.
[988.46 --> 989.60]  We've already dug into that.
[990.88 --> 991.68]  They are...
[992.80 --> 996.52]  One of the key points of differentiation seems to be originals.
[997.06 --> 999.68]  That's not something that's a major focus for Floatplane.
[999.86 --> 1001.78]  It's more like, okay, behind the scenes.
[1001.88 --> 1002.08]  Right.
[1002.08 --> 1006.98]  And early access, that's where we kind of see the value.
[1007.16 --> 1011.52]  But the way that I think creators are going to see it is they could use either of these
[1011.52 --> 1014.24]  as just like a toolbox of sorts anyway.
[1014.38 --> 1018.70]  I suspect that I haven't actually seen their creator agreement, although I'd be fascinated
[1018.70 --> 1019.38]  to, obviously.
[1019.72 --> 1024.00]  But I suspect they don't lock people into a particular way of using it because they describe themselves
[1024.00 --> 1025.62]  as a toolbox the same way that we do.
[1025.62 --> 1029.42]  So you could probably upload early access stuff there if you wanted.
[1030.08 --> 1033.60]  So our other major point of differentiation is video quality.
[1033.84 --> 1040.10]  And that's something where, because they're on AWS, they either can't or won't be competitive
[1040.10 --> 1040.92]  with YouTube on.
[1041.12 --> 1043.40]  So their 1080p is 3 megabit.
[1045.60 --> 1047.18]  Do you have context for that?
[1047.44 --> 1047.64]  Okay.
[1047.70 --> 1047.80]  Yeah.
[1047.80 --> 1048.32]  That's pretty low.
[1048.46 --> 1049.62]  So to put it in perspective...
[1049.62 --> 1051.38]  But I knew it was probably low.
[1051.38 --> 1051.74]  Yeah.
[1051.94 --> 1056.44]  YouTube's is somewhere in the neighborhood of, I think, 8 to 8, if I recall correctly.
[1056.62 --> 1057.72]  So more than double.
[1057.96 --> 1059.88]  And it does make a noticeable difference.
[1060.18 --> 1062.52]  Our 1080p is, I believe, closer to 15.
[1062.78 --> 1066.38]  So it's closer to the bit rate of YouTube's 1080, which is why...
[1066.38 --> 1067.22]  Excuse me, 4K.
[1067.64 --> 1071.64]  So that's why Floatplane at 1080 looks as good as YouTube at 4K.
[1071.70 --> 1074.54]  We're actually getting really close to launching 4K for Floatplane.
[1075.08 --> 1079.64]  But it's taking some time because we're honestly not quite sure how to roll it out.
[1079.64 --> 1081.52]  Do you think you can fire up a straw pool for me?
[1081.66 --> 1082.52]  I can do that.
[1082.68 --> 1082.94]  Okay.
[1083.36 --> 1085.16]  Riley's going to fire up a straw pool here.
[1086.70 --> 1087.86]  My electrician's calling.
[1088.06 --> 1088.78]  Sorry, Brian.
[1088.86 --> 1090.02]  I can't deal with that right now.
[1091.04 --> 1092.00]  What are we asking?
[1092.24 --> 1092.52]  LOL.
[1093.90 --> 1098.56]  We are going to ask people what they want to see from Floatplane's 4K.
[1100.08 --> 1102.58]  Because we've had some internal debate about it.
[1102.58 --> 1110.24]  So right now, our 720p already looks great because it's competitive with 1080p bit rates on other sites.
[1110.42 --> 1112.32]  But people don't like that.
[1112.74 --> 1117.90]  They don't want to click 720p when they have a 1080 screen.
[1118.22 --> 1118.72]  Right.
[1118.84 --> 1123.36]  Because they feel like they're getting shortchanged and they're not having the full experience.
[1123.36 --> 1126.76]  Yeah, and you can tell them 720p is just as good as 1080p all you want.
[1126.90 --> 1133.08]  Or they'll be like, look, I'm having performance problems because I can run 1080p on Netflix and YouTube.
[1133.22 --> 1133.66]  Oh.
[1134.18 --> 1136.32]  But I can only run 720p on Floatplane.
[1136.40 --> 1136.64]  Right.
[1136.70 --> 1137.56]  And be like, oh, okay.
[1137.92 --> 1142.96]  And the thing is, you can't explain to everyone in the world the difference between resolution and bitrate
[1142.96 --> 1145.68]  or the relationship between resolution and bitrate.
[1145.68 --> 1149.24]  So your resolution is just how many pixels by how many pixels.
[1149.76 --> 1158.22]  You could have a 4K resolution image that is at like, you know, a 2 kilobit per second bitrate
[1158.22 --> 1161.72]  that basically just looks like kind of shifting colors.
[1161.98 --> 1162.04]  Yeah.
[1162.20 --> 1162.96]  It looks like nothing.
[1163.10 --> 1164.72]  Like a postmodern art project.
[1164.84 --> 1168.20]  The pixels are there, but there's no information.
[1168.84 --> 1169.70]  That's the bitrate.
[1169.80 --> 1173.64]  Except that which you choose to glean from it.
[1173.76 --> 1174.10]  Yeah.
[1174.10 --> 1175.18]  Through interpretation.
[1175.18 --> 1176.86]  That could be, wow.
[1177.30 --> 1178.68]  That sounds like an art piece.
[1178.68 --> 1179.90]  Yeah, we could actually do this.
[1180.00 --> 1181.00]  Yeah, modern art museum.
[1181.78 --> 1183.04]  LTT gets into art.
[1183.36 --> 1183.94]  I know, right?
[1184.24 --> 1190.54]  So then on the other side of things, the bitrate only tells you sort of how much data stream you
[1190.54 --> 1191.38]  have to work with.
[1191.52 --> 1196.22]  You could have a very high bitrate and a very low resolution and you reach a point of diminishing
[1196.22 --> 1196.68]  returns.
[1196.96 --> 1202.72]  Like if you're running at 240p and then you, you know, go to 60 megabit per second.
[1202.72 --> 1205.32]  So for context, that's about like an HDR Blu-ray.
[1206.38 --> 1208.62]  It's still going to look pixelated and crappy.
[1209.14 --> 1212.54]  But it's going to look really a lot better on a 4K screen.
[1212.76 --> 1217.72]  No, it'll look, it'll look as good as it could given the limitations of the resolution.
[1217.72 --> 1220.72]  Each one of those pixels will be as good as it could be.
[1220.80 --> 1221.24]  Exactly.
[1221.48 --> 1223.30]  So you want to find, you want to find a balance.
[1224.12 --> 1229.02]  So anyway, we've got this issue with messaging where people get upset because they can't run
[1229.02 --> 1232.82]  the same resolution on float plane that they can on other sites.
[1232.82 --> 1239.52]  So in order for our 4K to really look a lot better than our 1080p, we're looking at bitrates
[1239.52 --> 1242.74]  in the range of 25 to 35 megabit per second.
[1242.94 --> 1246.40]  And that's getting close to a 1080p Blu-ray.
[1247.00 --> 1253.34]  Now the problem with that is that even people with a 50 megabit per second or 100 megabit per
[1253.34 --> 1258.40]  second connection to their internet provider might run into problems streaming this because
[1258.40 --> 1264.28]  of network overhead, because of nearby neighbors who are busy, you know, torrenting the Game
[1264.28 --> 1267.06]  of Thrones finale or whatever the case may be.
[1267.16 --> 1267.36]  Sure.
[1268.58 --> 1270.68]  And their service isn't able to sustain that.
[1271.10 --> 1276.58]  Also, sometimes you can run into kind of routing issues where it kind of goes around or it takes
[1276.58 --> 1277.30]  a bunch of jumps.
[1277.62 --> 1282.50]  And even though you've got the throughput, your connection quality isn't great.
[1282.60 --> 1284.08]  So you end up with buffering or lag.
[1284.08 --> 1292.00]  And as a young video serving service that's building our own CDN rather than using AWS for,
[1292.62 --> 1296.38]  because otherwise we wouldn't be able to do this really, really high quality, we don't
[1296.38 --> 1298.60]  have endpoints like on every block.
[1299.24 --> 1299.34]  Right.
[1299.40 --> 1303.08]  You know, that's more Netflix's jam, you know, once you reach that kind of a scale.
[1303.38 --> 1303.64]  Gotcha.
[1305.10 --> 1306.56]  So here's what I want to know.
[1306.70 --> 1307.06]  Okay.
[1307.06 --> 1315.26]  Everyone out there, not just float plane peeps, do you want us to A, downgrade our 1080p bit
[1315.26 --> 1323.58]  rate and then serve a 4K file that is a slightly higher bit rate than YouTube's 4K?
[1325.28 --> 1329.36]  Serve higher bit rate 4K.
[1329.36 --> 1334.64]  Option number two, leave our 1080p the way that it is, so about equivalent to YouTube's
[1334.64 --> 1340.14]  4K, and then have like a CPU internet connection murdering 4K.
[1341.50 --> 1343.86]  Serve way higher bit rate 4K?
[1343.92 --> 1344.08]  Yeah.
[1344.28 --> 1349.10]  I'm talking like 30 megabit a second, like crazy stupid for internet streaming.
[1349.10 --> 1355.24]  I mean, those are really the main options because I pitched Luke on having multiple 4K files
[1355.24 --> 1360.72]  that we could dynamically switch between so that people could press 4K and feel like they're
[1360.72 --> 1364.56]  getting the 4K experience, but so that if their internet connection sucked, we'd be able
[1364.56 --> 1366.34]  to just switch over to the lower bit rate one.
[1366.48 --> 1370.66]  And he was like, what are you trying to do to me?
[1371.12 --> 1371.56]  Please.
[1371.90 --> 1373.20]  Look, storage is expensive.
[1373.34 --> 1374.90]  Do you know how much storage costs?
[1374.98 --> 1376.34]  You pay for the storage.
[1376.34 --> 1379.08]  Do you really want multiple 4K files per video?
[1379.08 --> 1380.70]  I'm like, okay.
[1381.60 --> 1383.22]  So go ahead and create that poll.
[1383.46 --> 1384.14]  Like that?
[1385.30 --> 1386.20]  Yeah, sure.
[1386.28 --> 1386.50]  Whatever.
[1386.58 --> 1386.96]  That's fine.
[1387.10 --> 1387.44]  All right.
[1387.50 --> 1388.28]  So create that poll.
[1388.40 --> 1389.76]  I want to know what people want to see.
[1389.92 --> 1392.70]  I'm going ahead and fire up your screen here.
[1392.76 --> 1394.00]  Do you want to post that in the YouTube chat?
[1394.42 --> 1395.50]  Do you have the YouTube chat open?
[1395.60 --> 1396.24]  Is this the link?
[1396.30 --> 1397.66]  I've never actually created a straw poll.
[1397.66 --> 1399.12]  You've never created a straw poll before?
[1399.24 --> 1399.74]  Is that it?
[1399.82 --> 1401.64]  Yeah, throw it in the floatplane chat first, I guess.
[1401.94 --> 1402.62]  Oh, no, that's Twitch.
[1402.88 --> 1403.14]  What?
[1403.68 --> 1404.58]  I don't have the floatplane.
[1404.68 --> 1406.12]  I wasn't signed into floatplane.
[1406.12 --> 1406.34]  Oh, boy.
[1406.34 --> 1407.86]  Because I'm not signed in on this.
[1408.00 --> 1408.56]  Oh, boy.
[1408.92 --> 1409.50]  Oh, boy.
[1409.60 --> 1410.74]  Are you signed into anything?
[1411.68 --> 1412.20]  Oh, man.
[1412.24 --> 1412.82]  Do I just have to...
[1412.82 --> 1413.06]  Oh, here.
[1413.10 --> 1413.96]  I'll put it in the doc, dude.
[1414.02 --> 1414.62]  Type this menu.
[1414.70 --> 1414.92]  Okay.
[1415.04 --> 1415.78]  That works.
[1415.86 --> 1416.16]  That works.
[1416.16 --> 1416.76]  Where are you putting it?
[1416.80 --> 1417.16]  Very top?
[1417.32 --> 1417.76]  Very top.
[1417.80 --> 1418.32]  Very top.
[1418.40 --> 1418.70]  All right.
[1418.74 --> 1420.10]  I will post it in the chat.
[1421.36 --> 1421.72]  Boom.
[1422.80 --> 1423.40]  It's there.
[1424.54 --> 1426.78]  It's taken a hot minute to...
[1426.78 --> 1427.30]  There it goes.
[1428.20 --> 1428.66]  Dang it.
[1428.66 --> 1433.44]  I pressed refresh on the page right as it popped in.
[1434.44 --> 1437.94]  Here's the poll, guys, in Twitch.
[1438.06 --> 1438.40]  Boom.
[1439.08 --> 1439.64]  All right.
[1439.82 --> 1440.72]  That's Luke.
[1440.88 --> 1442.12]  Here's my floatplane chat.
[1442.22 --> 1443.16]  I'm Luke on Twitch.
[1443.26 --> 1443.88]  Boom.
[1444.58 --> 1445.34]  All right.
[1445.34 --> 1450.42]  Oh, I see an interesting suggestion in floatplane chat already.
[1451.36 --> 1452.28]  How about this?
[1452.34 --> 1458.74]  How about you stream at, like, sort of the, you know, better but not ridiculous quality,
[1458.74 --> 1465.04]  but then have the download be available in, like, you know, murderous quality.
[1465.84 --> 1466.00]  Okay.
[1466.08 --> 1472.14]  So that doesn't get around Luke's concern that we are still outputting multiple 4K files for
[1472.14 --> 1475.82]  every upload, but I will consider it.
[1476.50 --> 1480.60]  It's just that, like I said, storage is really, really expensive.
[1482.34 --> 1482.78]  Yeah.
[1483.38 --> 1484.32]  How about Kodak?
[1484.50 --> 1486.90]  H.265 and VP9 are quite a bit more efficient.
[1487.06 --> 1492.90]  Yes, that is a good suggestion, but unfortunately, it's challenging.
[1494.24 --> 1498.42]  Hudson Toady says, why not have a variable bitrate on the fly instead of different files?
[1499.50 --> 1500.76]  That's complicated.
[1502.14 --> 1505.82]  Don't get, don't, don't make me get started on that.
[1506.02 --> 1508.06]  That's, like, really, really complicated.
[1508.24 --> 1513.78]  Look, like, we're hiring more people, but we would need a lot of stuff for that.
[1514.38 --> 1514.86]  All right.
[1514.98 --> 1515.78]  So I'm going to go ahead.
[1515.86 --> 1518.66]  I'm going to load up the, load up the results here and we can have a look.
[1519.04 --> 1523.10]  Seems like most people want us to leave 1080p as is.
[1523.24 --> 1525.56]  And just murder their connections?
[1526.56 --> 1527.00]  Okay.
[1528.08 --> 1530.54]  Well, it looks like that's the way we're going then.
[1530.54 --> 1533.70]  Well, why would you want, I mean, most people are going to be watching in 1080p.
[1534.26 --> 1535.10]  No, they won't.
[1535.50 --> 1537.94]  I think most people just click highest quality.
[1538.02 --> 1539.32]  Well, that must be the highest quality one.
[1539.50 --> 1539.74]  Yeah.
[1539.96 --> 1543.20]  And then if they get stuttering, then I feel like they're going to be unhappy.
[1543.20 --> 1553.06]  I mean, for me, when I'm on YouTube or anywhere where I'm, I only make, I only go to up the quality when I think that the quality visibly looks not good enough.
[1553.56 --> 1558.30]  Like on YouTube, if I'm like, this looks a little blurry, then I'll go to the quality and check.
[1558.70 --> 1559.96]  That's an interesting perspective.
[1559.96 --> 1566.02]  I used to go, I think when 4K first came out on YouTube, I used to go click on 4K because I wanted the highest quality every time.
[1566.08 --> 1566.52]  But now.
[1566.66 --> 1569.94]  I think they also never defaulted to 4K back when they first rolled it out.
[1571.20 --> 1571.60]  Right.
[1571.78 --> 1575.58]  Well, actually, I think if you upload it in 4K, I'm not sure.
[1575.68 --> 1579.26]  I think it kind of intelligently scaled based on like what you were watching.
[1579.26 --> 1580.70]  I think it really depended.
[1580.84 --> 1589.02]  I think at that time, they didn't just automatically set people's playback to 4K because just the average computer.
[1589.28 --> 1590.56]  Yeah, was much slower.
[1591.18 --> 1594.22]  So the landscape has changed a fair bit now.
[1594.28 --> 1599.76]  And YouTube does automatically select 4K when it notices you have a screen resolution and a connection that can handle it just fine.
[1600.04 --> 1600.38]  I see.
[1600.64 --> 1604.42]  I mean, another option is always going the Netflix route where they just don't give you the choice.
[1604.60 --> 1605.86]  It just is whatever.
[1606.28 --> 1607.10]  It is what it is.
[1607.14 --> 1607.28]  Yeah.
[1607.60 --> 1608.08]  Enjoy.
[1608.08 --> 1608.12]  Enjoy.
[1608.70 --> 1610.02]  Go watch some Crave.
[1610.10 --> 1610.82]  Or don't enjoy.
[1610.96 --> 1611.28]  Yeah, exactly.
[1611.28 --> 1611.96]  Or not Crave.
[1612.10 --> 1612.46]  Crave.
[1612.72 --> 1614.10]  We have Crave up here in Canada.
[1614.26 --> 1615.52]  In the States, it's...
[1615.52 --> 1617.58]  Do they have Crave in the States?
[1617.76 --> 1620.24]  No, it's HBO now or...
[1620.24 --> 1623.12]  Because Crave is like HBO Showtime and...
[1623.12 --> 1624.14]  Anyways, whatever, guys.
[1624.36 --> 1625.34]  Don't worry about it.
[1625.48 --> 1626.52]  Don't worry about it, guys.
[1627.00 --> 1629.18]  Hey, should we talk about like news?
[1629.54 --> 1630.28]  This is news.
[1630.52 --> 1630.88]  Oh.
[1631.46 --> 1632.20]  Well, yeah.
[1632.36 --> 1633.52]  You don't think Standard and...
[1633.52 --> 1634.54]  No, I think it's important.
[1634.54 --> 1635.38]  Nebula is news?
[1635.38 --> 1639.94]  I always forget that, you know, WAN Show is more kind of just about like, we're just chilling.
[1640.12 --> 1642.56]  No, WAN Show is about the news.
[1642.92 --> 1643.22]  It is.
[1643.22 --> 1647.32]  So why don't we talk about YouTube changing the subscriber counter?
[1647.32 --> 1650.40]  Now, I know this is something that you feel quite passionately about.
[1650.50 --> 1653.04]  This was posted by TechDreamer on the forum.
[1653.18 --> 1655.70]  I'm just going to go ahead and bring up that thread.
[1655.82 --> 1660.14]  And it is obviously a very polarizing topic.
[1660.52 --> 1661.94]  Oh, subscribe, negative one.
[1663.30 --> 1663.62]  Yeah.
[1663.72 --> 1664.00]  That's funny.
[1665.14 --> 1665.54]  No.
[1665.78 --> 1666.94]  Well, here's some behind the scenes.
[1667.06 --> 1671.44]  Before we started the show, I was kind of like, oh, this doesn't seem like that big of a deal to me.
[1671.58 --> 1673.88]  And Linus was like, what?
[1673.88 --> 1674.16]  What?
[1674.48 --> 1675.84]  That's not what I said.
[1675.84 --> 1677.00]  That was a perfect impression.
[1677.20 --> 1679.12]  That is not what I sounded like.
[1679.36 --> 1681.78]  I sounded quite different from that.
[1681.96 --> 1682.06]  Okay.
[1682.86 --> 1684.00]  So, in and out...
[1684.00 --> 1684.92]  Do you want to explain what's happening?
[1685.24 --> 1687.06]  Well, I don't actually entirely know what's happening.
[1687.10 --> 1687.66]  I'll explain what's happening.
[1687.66 --> 1689.10]  Wait, I'll tell you what's happening.
[1689.18 --> 1689.40]  All right.
[1689.44 --> 1689.94]  Tell me what's happening.
[1689.94 --> 1694.94]  So YouTube appears to be changing the way that they're displaying subscriber counts.
[1695.14 --> 1697.90]  You can see it in the GIF that's on screen right now.
[1698.16 --> 1700.54]  They're basically going to start rounding it.
[1700.54 --> 1702.08]  They've been doing it for some creators.
[1702.30 --> 1702.46]  Yep.
[1702.66 --> 1705.90]  If you go on YouTube, you've been able to see this already happening.
[1706.10 --> 1712.20]  But now it's going to be kind of standard procedure for them to round to, like, the nearest whatever it is.
[1712.24 --> 1714.44]  They actually give some examples, I think, in this post.
[1714.50 --> 1716.56]  And they've always done it in some places.
[1716.94 --> 1717.08]  Right.
[1717.12 --> 1720.68]  Like, for example, actually, I'm going to pop out of this now.
[1720.74 --> 1724.88]  And I'm going to jump into my own YouTube dashboard here for a second.
[1725.20 --> 1726.42]  And yes, it's GIF, guys.
[1727.46 --> 1728.38]  Linus has GIF, too.
[1728.44 --> 1729.00]  Don't get at me.
[1729.00 --> 1732.94]  Why are you throwing me under the same bus?
[1733.00 --> 1734.28]  You can say GIF if you want.
[1734.34 --> 1735.18]  I have no problems.
[1735.48 --> 1737.10]  No, I'm a GIF person.
[1737.14 --> 1738.24]  I grew up saying GIF.
[1738.48 --> 1738.76]  All right?
[1738.84 --> 1740.32]  That's what I am.
[1740.44 --> 1741.18]  But did you?
[1741.80 --> 1742.06]  Yeah.
[1742.50 --> 1742.84]  Really?
[1743.04 --> 1744.02]  I never said GIF.
[1744.40 --> 1744.76]  Oh.
[1745.10 --> 1745.76]  See, first...
[1745.76 --> 1746.90]  The first time I saw it, it was GIF.
[1746.96 --> 1749.88]  And then when I heard somebody say GIF the first time, I was like, what?
[1750.14 --> 1750.40]  Oh, that's interesting.
[1750.40 --> 1751.64]  But now I've learned to accept it.
[1751.70 --> 1752.50]  I'm like, hey, you know what?
[1752.52 --> 1753.16]  You want to say GIF?
[1753.30 --> 1753.54]  Fine.
[1753.62 --> 1754.18]  You want to say GIF?
[1754.26 --> 1754.74]  It's fine.
[1755.04 --> 1755.68]  I say GIF.
[1755.68 --> 1762.62]  See, I only switched over when the creator came out and said that...
[1762.62 --> 1763.04]  Oh, really?
[1763.10 --> 1764.74]  It was GIF, not GIF.
[1764.80 --> 1765.88]  That was just a bonus for me.
[1766.30 --> 1767.34]  No, no, yeah.
[1767.74 --> 1769.98]  And then everyone got all mad about that.
[1770.18 --> 1773.22]  So just to be a troll, I started doing it.
[1773.22 --> 1777.18]  Because I've noticed you said it in the weekly meetings.
[1777.54 --> 1777.82]  Yeah.
[1778.00 --> 1781.32]  Because I didn't know that you said it until a couple weeks ago or something.
[1781.40 --> 1782.42]  You said it for the first time.
[1782.48 --> 1783.42]  I was like...
[1783.42 --> 1784.52]  No, I did switch over.
[1784.78 --> 1786.56]  Because we had an argument with it in my carpool.
[1787.18 --> 1787.58]  Oh.
[1788.70 --> 1791.22]  Who are the wrong people in your carpool?
[1792.12 --> 1792.52]  James.
[1792.92 --> 1793.44]  David.
[1793.70 --> 1794.00]  Oof.
[1795.10 --> 1795.54]  Lloyd.
[1795.54 --> 1795.94]  No.
[1796.42 --> 1799.14]  Yeah, it's a GIF and you display them on your Giraffix card.
[1799.94 --> 1800.30]  Yay!
[1800.84 --> 1802.80]  Oh, you're just doing it to be rude.
[1803.42 --> 1804.30]  No, not at all.
[1804.30 --> 1806.02]  And I'm just out here trying to be a good person.
[1806.14 --> 1806.82]  No, no, no, no.
[1806.98 --> 1807.34]  GIF.
[1807.54 --> 1807.86]  GIF.
[1809.24 --> 1809.94]  Okay, anyway.
[1810.74 --> 1811.46]  YouTube subscribers.
[1811.46 --> 1811.76]  I can't find it.
[1811.84 --> 1813.54]  Yeah, I was looking for a spot where...
[1814.16 --> 1814.72]  You know what?
[1814.74 --> 1815.70]  It might be on mobile.
[1815.70 --> 1816.38]  Oh, here we go.
[1816.46 --> 1821.86]  If a channel has 4,227 subscribers, the public subscriber count will read 4.2K.
[1822.24 --> 1822.48]  Yep.
[1822.48 --> 1829.40]  So basically just gets rid of the last, you know, two or three or four digits based on,
[1829.48 --> 1833.42]  you know, whether you're in the thousands or the tens of thousands or the millions.
[1833.56 --> 1833.80]  Yes.
[1834.14 --> 1838.64]  Now, the one exception to this is channels that are under a thousand subscribers.
[1838.76 --> 1845.32]  Those ones will still display with complete granularity because the rationale behind this
[1845.32 --> 1851.20]  change, which is actually what I find most obnoxious, like none of the rest of this stuff
[1851.20 --> 1852.12]  really matters to me.
[1852.86 --> 1858.70]  The rationale behind it is that what they're trying to prevent is dislike bombing.
[1859.46 --> 1861.28]  Or, excuse me, unsubscribe bombing.
[1861.72 --> 1862.16]  Right.
[1862.26 --> 1864.56]  So there was a recent controversy between...
[1864.56 --> 1865.82]  Toddy versus James Charles.
[1865.88 --> 1869.92]  Two people about whom I know and care nothing, quite frankly.
[1870.36 --> 1872.68]  I don't really know anything about them except their names.
[1872.68 --> 1874.60]  They, they, I read...
[1874.60 --> 1875.16]  Makeup people.
[1875.26 --> 1883.98]  I read one article on a particularly vapid site and it told me everything I need to know
[1883.98 --> 1886.58]  about not needing to know anything about any of this.
[1887.58 --> 1894.82]  But basically what happened was there was some sort of like, oh no, they didn't drama on YouTube.
[1894.82 --> 1900.66]  And one of these people, I don't even know which one, don't clarify it for me.
[1900.84 --> 1901.40]  I really don't care.
[1901.40 --> 1902.66]  James Charles is a bad guy.
[1902.66 --> 1902.86]  I don't care.
[1903.46 --> 1904.80]  Toddy is the good guy.
[1905.44 --> 1905.76]  Girl.
[1906.48 --> 1906.84]  Person.
[1909.02 --> 1909.42]  What?
[1909.96 --> 1910.30]  Ooh.
[1910.52 --> 1910.80]  Okay.
[1910.80 --> 1911.94]  You think we're going to get in trouble for that?
[1912.00 --> 1912.58]  No, no, no.
[1912.68 --> 1913.50]  Just, I...
[1913.50 --> 1914.34]  I'm just joking.
[1914.46 --> 1914.86]  You know what?
[1915.30 --> 1915.96]  It doesn't matter.
[1916.08 --> 1921.98]  The point is, the point is, one of them I think lost like two million subscribers or something
[1921.98 --> 1924.06]  like that over a very short period of time.
[1924.24 --> 1924.42]  Yeah.
[1924.62 --> 1931.68]  And so what YouTube is trying to do is remove the, um, the instant gratification that people
[1931.68 --> 1932.10]  get.
[1932.12 --> 1934.38]  Oh, you thought I was being weird when I say good guy.
[1934.46 --> 1935.54]  No, Toddy is the girl.
[1936.42 --> 1937.14]  I, I don't...
[1937.14 --> 1937.78]  Okay, just to clarify.
[1938.00 --> 1938.52]  I don't know.
[1938.58 --> 1939.14]  These are just...
[1939.14 --> 1939.66]  Yeah, yeah, no.
[1939.76 --> 1939.82]  Keep going.
[1939.82 --> 1942.34]  Toddy is a random assembly of characters.
[1942.46 --> 1942.60]  Right.
[1942.60 --> 1943.12]  It's not...
[1943.12 --> 1943.42]  Gotcha.
[1943.48 --> 1944.46]  That's not even a name.
[1945.34 --> 1945.78]  Toddy.
[1946.48 --> 1947.12]  Okay, sorry.
[1947.22 --> 1947.80]  I interrupted you.
[1948.14 --> 1949.10]  Um, okay.
[1949.10 --> 1955.02]  So, what they're trying to prevent is people unsubscribe bombing and getting that instant
[1955.02 --> 1958.46]  gratification of seeing the subscriber number go down.
[1958.88 --> 1964.84]  And then, news outlets start jumping in and reporting on this and going, they lost 100,000
[1964.84 --> 1965.42]  subscribers.
[1965.48 --> 1966.14]  And that just feeds.
[1966.14 --> 1966.52]  And it's all over.
[1966.72 --> 1969.10]  And then it becomes this negative feedback loop.
[1969.28 --> 1972.40]  And at the end of the day, YouTube doesn't want people unsubscribing.
[1972.58 --> 1972.88]  Right.
[1973.06 --> 1974.14]  They don't want people to stop watching.
[1974.14 --> 1974.98]  Yeah, they don't want that.
[1974.98 --> 1979.48]  Even if they're unsubscribing from somebody and subscribing to another person, well, maybe
[1979.48 --> 1979.90]  they...
[1979.90 --> 1981.22]  Maybe that's a neutral.
[1981.44 --> 1986.98]  But from my perspective, removing this sort of...
[1986.98 --> 1996.82]  This insight that we have into how the platform is operating is really frustrating and just makes
[1996.82 --> 1998.26]  our jobs more difficult.
[1998.26 --> 2000.50]  So, one of the things that...
[2000.50 --> 2001.50]  One of the tools that...
[2001.50 --> 2002.02]  You don't like that she's...
[2002.02 --> 2005.32]  You don't like that YouTube is telling us about this?
[2005.60 --> 2005.84]  No.
[2005.94 --> 2013.00]  What I don't like is that YouTube is removing yet another piece of bloody information that
[2013.00 --> 2013.50]  we have.
[2013.60 --> 2013.78]  Ah.
[2014.24 --> 2014.76]  So...
[2014.76 --> 2016.26]  As...
[2016.26 --> 2016.98]  Well, as a public.
[2016.98 --> 2017.26]  Yes.
[2017.26 --> 2020.86]  Because the creators themselves still have the access to how many specific subscribers.
[2020.86 --> 2022.56]  That they have themselves, yes.
[2022.56 --> 2022.86]  Okay.
[2022.86 --> 2027.50]  So, just to be clear, I still get an accurate subscriber count within my dashboard.
[2027.50 --> 2027.84]  Right.
[2027.98 --> 2032.44]  But you guys will not be able to see exactly how many subscribers I have at Linus Tech Tips.
[2032.60 --> 2039.00]  Now, the thing is, there are third-party sites like socialblade.com that allow creators to
[2039.00 --> 2043.56]  keep tabs on how the platform is doing overall.
[2043.80 --> 2047.74]  So, we can track how many views other creators are getting.
[2047.84 --> 2047.96]  Right.
[2047.96 --> 2050.36]  We can track how many subscribers they are gaining or losing.
[2050.86 --> 2056.44]  And it's a really valuable tool for figuring out what the overall trends are on the YouTube
[2056.44 --> 2061.36]  platform without relying on useless tools like the YouTube trending tab.
[2061.48 --> 2061.62]  Right.
[2061.62 --> 2062.58]  Which is useless.
[2062.92 --> 2063.96]  You know how I know it's useless?
[2064.24 --> 2070.44]  Because of how many of my videos end up in it that honestly aren't doing very well.
[2070.60 --> 2071.82]  Like, I shouldn't be trending.
[2071.92 --> 2073.14]  This is clearly not trending.
[2073.60 --> 2075.42]  I don't know how you define trending.
[2075.42 --> 2080.00]  I just watched an interesting video about the trending tab today, which was saying that
[2080.00 --> 2085.68]  in Canada here, if you're on the Canadian version of YouTube, the trending page is completely
[2085.68 --> 2087.02]  different than it is in the U.S.
[2087.02 --> 2087.80]  I didn't know this.
[2087.92 --> 2088.44]  Sure is.
[2088.68 --> 2092.12]  It's all like traditional media.
[2092.98 --> 2095.94]  It was a video by Coffee Break, if you guys know who that is.
[2096.06 --> 2100.02]  But it's all like traditional media, like late night talk shows and like real news outlets
[2100.02 --> 2101.44]  and stuff on the trending page.
[2101.48 --> 2103.98]  And in Canada, we go down and it's all YouTubers.
[2103.98 --> 2104.48]  Yeah.
[2104.78 --> 2105.00]  Yeah.
[2105.38 --> 2106.42]  It's totally different.
[2106.56 --> 2109.30]  So whenever I'm down in the States, I do notice that.
[2109.40 --> 2114.00]  The other funny thing is my Creator Studio app gives me a notification every time I hit
[2114.00 --> 2114.30]  trending.
[2114.58 --> 2120.14]  So when I'm in Canada, like every other day I get a stupid, you're trending, let your audience
[2120.14 --> 2121.54]  know notification.
[2121.54 --> 2122.54]  Oh my gosh.
[2122.54 --> 2125.56]  But I'm on Canada trending, which is utterly worthless.
[2125.78 --> 2126.36]  Right, right, right.
[2126.98 --> 2129.86]  Whereas U.S. trending, I think, might actually matter a little bit.
[2129.88 --> 2129.98]  Yeah.
[2129.98 --> 2134.54]  I wonder if like, I guess, oh wait, they know we're...
[2135.76 --> 2136.12]  Yeah.
[2136.22 --> 2136.54]  They know we're...
[2136.54 --> 2138.52]  No, you're getting a notification because you're in Canada.
[2138.64 --> 2138.94]  Yes.
[2138.94 --> 2143.34]  But also I think we get served to Canadian trending a lot because we're Canadian.
[2143.48 --> 2149.42]  Now YouTube has told me straight up to my face that it doesn't matter where you geographically
[2149.42 --> 2152.54]  upload from in terms of how the algorithm serves it.
[2152.62 --> 2156.88]  But it might not matter to them, but maybe the algorithm has some, you know, subtle biases.
[2156.88 --> 2157.92]  Don't buy it.
[2158.22 --> 2162.84]  Because it's like, when's the last time I got a recommendation for a technical Guruji
[2162.84 --> 2163.22]  video?
[2165.46 --> 2165.94]  Never?
[2166.20 --> 2167.90]  Yeah, well I couldn't answer that question.
[2168.14 --> 2168.38]  Yeah.
[2169.00 --> 2173.24]  Well, when's the last time you got a recommendation for a technical Guruji video?
[2173.34 --> 2174.42]  I don't know who that is.
[2174.56 --> 2175.00]  Exactly.
[2175.30 --> 2179.00]  He's only huge with over 10 million subscribers in the tech vertical.
[2179.10 --> 2180.32]  I'm looking up who it is right now.
[2181.14 --> 2186.48]  But obviously, because he doesn't speak English and he's located in...
[2186.48 --> 2187.26]  Okay, I don't feel bad.
[2187.28 --> 2188.18]  He's based out of Dubai?
[2188.36 --> 2189.48]  Yeah, he's based out of Dubai.
[2189.80 --> 2190.00]  Yep.
[2191.38 --> 2193.92]  Obviously, those videos don't get served to me.
[2193.94 --> 2194.12]  Right.
[2194.30 --> 2196.62]  Now, okay, that one's in a different language.
[2196.92 --> 2198.34]  That's a very extreme example.
[2199.42 --> 2203.42]  But I still don't believe that it doesn't matter at all.
[2203.60 --> 2206.04]  The Social Blade thing is extremely interesting.
[2206.44 --> 2206.62]  Yeah.
[2206.62 --> 2211.54]  I forgot about that because Social Blade takes advantage of the publicly available statistics
[2211.54 --> 2212.26]  that are there.
[2212.94 --> 2214.28]  And now they won't have access to that.
[2214.28 --> 2216.46]  So we can't even go to like...
[2216.46 --> 2217.94]  We can't even stalk other channels.
[2218.20 --> 2219.20]  Now, it doesn't appear to be...
[2219.20 --> 2220.30]  Which is one of my favorite things to do.
[2220.40 --> 2224.94]  It doesn't appear to be confirmed whether Social Blade will be affected because Social Blade
[2224.94 --> 2230.22]  is hooked into YouTube's API rather than just screen scraping the data off of the site.
[2230.22 --> 2237.04]  But my strong suspicion is that if they're trying to prevent news outlets from reporting on
[2237.04 --> 2243.92]  unsubscription bombing, they're going to remove this data from the API as well.
[2244.06 --> 2245.48]  Has Social Blade said anything about that?
[2245.48 --> 2246.52]  Yes, they have, actually.
[2246.82 --> 2251.04]  I believe the latest statement is that they don't know how it's going to affect them.
[2251.30 --> 2251.56]  Okay.
[2251.74 --> 2253.68]  Because has it rolled out completely yet?
[2253.68 --> 2257.20]  No, it doesn't roll out until sometime in August, if I recall correctly.
[2257.24 --> 2258.66]  I just got signed out of the doc.
[2258.86 --> 2259.46]  So...
[2259.46 --> 2264.58]  Moving later this year, it says.
[2264.76 --> 2264.94]  Yeah.
[2265.00 --> 2265.98]  I think it's August.
[2267.12 --> 2267.56]  Okay.
[2269.14 --> 2269.50]  Huh.
[2269.72 --> 2269.94]  Yeah.
[2270.02 --> 2270.98]  I think it's August.
[2272.16 --> 2272.60]  Okay.
[2274.04 --> 2274.56]  Huh.
[2275.98 --> 2276.46]  Effective...
[2277.32 --> 2277.78]  August.
[2277.96 --> 2278.24]  Okay.
[2278.24 --> 2283.94]  We'll make this more consistent by always showing abbreviated sub counts publicly.
[2284.98 --> 2290.06]  So Social Blade said, upon closer look, it may affect our data display, but only time will tell.
[2291.54 --> 2292.18]  So...
[2292.18 --> 2292.80]  Yeah, that's okay.
[2292.86 --> 2293.58]  Now I'm with you.
[2293.64 --> 2294.28]  I'm against it.
[2295.20 --> 2296.06]  I'm against it.
[2296.22 --> 2296.76]  This is...
[2296.76 --> 2297.76]  This is bad.
[2298.78 --> 2299.76]  You know what else is bad?
[2299.86 --> 2300.80]  I'm upset.
[2301.32 --> 2302.50]  You know what isn't bad?
[2302.76 --> 2304.80]  Oh, I was going to say this segue to our sponsor.
[2304.86 --> 2306.28]  Yeah, well, that's why I was helping you.
[2306.52 --> 2307.40]  Oh, I see.
[2307.40 --> 2308.66]  You said what is bad, and I was like, that's not a...
[2308.66 --> 2309.90]  My segue was going to be bad.
[2310.74 --> 2311.14]  Oh.
[2312.56 --> 2312.94]  It's okay.
[2313.02 --> 2313.46]  You only ruined it a little bit.
[2313.46 --> 2314.68]  Now it was bad, so...
[2314.68 --> 2319.50]  This episode is brought to you by the Corsair Iron Claw Wireless Gaming Mouse.
[2320.28 --> 2322.44]  It's got a comfortable palm grip.
[2322.54 --> 2329.30]  It uses a PMW 3391 optical sensor featuring native 18,000 DPI.
[2329.64 --> 2333.06]  It's got three methods of connection, so you can plug it in through a wire.
[2333.24 --> 2333.88]  That'll charge it.
[2333.88 --> 2338.22]  You can use their Slipstream Wireless technology, which gives you sub-1 millisecond latency and
[2338.22 --> 2339.26]  33 feet of range.
[2339.42 --> 2344.32]  Or you can use Bluetooth if you want to use it with a device that either doesn't have room
[2344.32 --> 2348.24]  for a dongle, or if you don't want to put a dongle into it, like if you wanted to use
[2348.24 --> 2351.02]  it with your tablet or your laptop on the go, or whatever the case may be.
[2351.22 --> 2351.36]  Hmm.
[2351.36 --> 2356.16]  It features up to 24 hours of battery life, and it's made for FPS and MOBA gaming with
[2356.16 --> 2357.88]  three-zone RGB and a two-year warranty.
[2358.12 --> 2361.04]  You can get yours today at the link in the video description.
[2361.98 --> 2362.20]  Huh.
[2362.48 --> 2364.16]  Also sponsoring the show today, Squarespace.
[2364.72 --> 2365.16]  Squarespace.
[2365.52 --> 2366.24]  We use Squarespace.
[2366.52 --> 2366.88]  No joke.
[2367.12 --> 2368.06]  We actually use it.
[2368.20 --> 2374.90]  Both our LinusMediaGroup.com and LTXExpo.com websites were built quickly using Squarespace.
[2375.12 --> 2376.04]  I'm just going to bring that up.
[2376.52 --> 2376.86]  Why not?
[2376.86 --> 2379.32]  LTXExpo.com.
[2380.12 --> 2381.80]  I'm going to bring up our updates.
[2382.54 --> 2385.14]  Guys, Squarespace is an all-in-one platform.
[2385.16 --> 2385.34]  Hey!
[2385.46 --> 2388.16]  Colton did an update, and I didn't remind him.
[2388.62 --> 2388.86]  Oh.
[2388.94 --> 2389.38]  Oh, look.
[2389.44 --> 2390.32]  Written by Colton Potter.
[2390.32 --> 2393.20]  I remember the first time I built a PC back in 2012.
[2393.82 --> 2399.46]  Luke had to do about 85% of the work while I stared in confusion, coming from my old-school
[2399.46 --> 2403.94]  console life, preparing for the Era 37 catastrophe that was the Diablo 3 launch.
[2403.94 --> 2407.18]  It can be a tough job to build your first rig if you don't know someone, or if you haven't
[2407.18 --> 2408.40]  watched every YouTube guide there is.
[2408.54 --> 2411.62]  That's why we're doing a PC building workshop.
[2411.72 --> 2412.88]  On the tech link set.
[2412.88 --> 2413.18]  What is this?
[2413.18 --> 2414.12]  What is this old thing?
[2414.78 --> 2415.54]  Oh, okay.
[2415.64 --> 2415.98]  Cool.
[2416.50 --> 2421.46]  So we partnered with iFixit, XFX, FreeGeek, and others to put together a sizable collection
[2421.46 --> 2423.70]  of computer hardware for attendees to learn on.
[2424.08 --> 2427.74]  The configurations aren't going to blow you away, but they're modern enough that the fundamentals
[2427.74 --> 2428.90]  are the same.
[2428.90 --> 2433.26]  So go check it out, and that's going to be great.
[2433.32 --> 2435.42]  Anyway, this website that you're looking at was made on Squarespace.
[2435.92 --> 2439.96]  If you haven't heard already, Squarespace makes it easy to get your website up and running
[2439.96 --> 2440.28]  quickly.
[2440.44 --> 2441.66]  Even Colton can do it.
[2441.88 --> 2445.36]  You can choose from tons of different templates, find the one that makes the most sense, and
[2445.36 --> 2445.88]  run with it.
[2446.10 --> 2447.88]  And if you need help, Squarespace offers webinars.
[2448.28 --> 2452.38]  They've got a full series of help guides, and you can contact their support team 24-7
[2452.38 --> 2453.58]  to help you build your site.
[2453.58 --> 2458.52]  Head to squarespace.com forward slash WAN, and use offer code WAN to save 10%.
[2458.52 --> 2461.80]  Finally, the WAN Show is brought to you by Madrinas.
[2462.44 --> 2468.30]  Clearly, they weren't too offended by the official Madrinas roast of Linus Sebastian.
[2468.46 --> 2469.56]  They still sponsor us.
[2469.64 --> 2470.60]  They got roasted a little bit.
[2470.68 --> 2471.94]  Yeah, they did a little bit.
[2472.30 --> 2476.74]  Madrinas Coffee is coffee for fuel, organic cold brew coffee, and convenient 15-ounce grab-and-go
[2476.74 --> 2478.38]  cans with a flavor for everyone.
[2478.46 --> 2478.96]  Like this one.
[2478.96 --> 2483.48]  They offer sweet and creamy flavors like mocha or caramel, and bold flavors like their
[2483.48 --> 2484.24]  cold brew black.
[2484.38 --> 2489.86]  We have a permanent item on their e-store, the Lambo Coffee Beans Roast, also our limited
[2489.86 --> 2492.52]  edition cafe vanilla cold brew cans.
[2492.58 --> 2499.24]  And you can check them out at madrinascoffee.com slash Linus to get 40% off your order with code
[2499.24 --> 2499.90]  Linus.
[2500.02 --> 2501.10]  I was drinking one the whole time.
[2501.14 --> 2501.54]  Did you know?
[2501.72 --> 2502.92]  I did know that, yes.
[2502.94 --> 2504.64]  You pointed that out at the beginning of the show as well.
[2504.70 --> 2504.92]  Okay.
[2504.92 --> 2509.42]  If you have any questions about Madrinas, Shlomo from their team is in the chat, ready
[2509.42 --> 2512.04]  to answer your questions through direct messages.
[2512.72 --> 2513.12]  Mmm.
[2513.64 --> 2514.26]  All right.
[2515.10 --> 2515.46]  Delicious.
[2516.00 --> 2517.34]  Why don't we jump into-
[2517.34 --> 2517.94]  And nutritious.
[2518.16 --> 2520.02]  What was our next topic that we had lined up here?
[2520.10 --> 2522.90]  Oh, 5G could break weather forecasting.
[2523.44 --> 2525.14]  I had not heard about this.
[2525.26 --> 2529.50]  Yeah, I had seen like a reference to it in a couple stories before, but apparently it's
[2529.50 --> 2532.30]  like, it's actually kind of a problem.
[2532.30 --> 2537.60]  And it's also a problem because all of these companies are racing to get to 5G first.
[2537.60 --> 2542.84]  And we're not really taking the time to realize like, or to explore what problems this could
[2542.84 --> 2544.88]  So there's no calm before this storm-
[2544.88 --> 2545.42]  Hey!
[2545.72 --> 2547.74]  Hits us that we didn't see coming.
[2547.98 --> 2550.12]  The storm of great data speeds.
[2550.20 --> 2553.52]  The storm of actual, like, debris in the air.
[2553.60 --> 2554.32]  Real storms.
[2554.58 --> 2555.60]  We didn't see it coming.
[2555.60 --> 2562.64]  So NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have been sounding the alarm
[2562.64 --> 2568.64]  that the wireless spectrum used for 5G networks could interfere with data collection that is
[2568.64 --> 2569.98]  used in weather forecasting.
[2570.22 --> 2572.54]  Now, I don't know if you've noticed this.
[2572.58 --> 2573.34]  I certainly have.
[2573.66 --> 2577.08]  But weather forecasts are sure a heck of a lot more accurate now than they were when
[2577.08 --> 2577.60]  I was a kid.
[2578.12 --> 2578.54]  Are they?
[2578.54 --> 2583.54]  I mean, back then, the joke used to basically be that the weatherman was like-
[2583.54 --> 2583.88]  Ah.
[2584.00 --> 2586.36]  And remember, this was back then, so it was a weatherman.
[2587.30 --> 2587.88]  Not anymore.
[2588.16 --> 2588.56]  Okay.
[2589.12 --> 2590.76]  Now it's the weather reporter?
[2591.54 --> 2591.64]  Weather person?
[2591.64 --> 2593.44]  What is the gender-neutral weather-
[2593.44 --> 2594.20]  Meteorologist.
[2594.58 --> 2594.84]  Sure.
[2594.84 --> 2601.10]  So anyway, back then, the joke was that just like, you know, before the news started,
[2601.30 --> 2604.46]  the weatherman would take a dart and throw it at a thing, and then that was the weather
[2604.46 --> 2604.84]  forecast.
[2604.84 --> 2610.42]  Because honestly, you know, back in the late 80s, early 90s, they didn't have the kind
[2610.42 --> 2616.54]  of big data that they do now and the kinds of, like, supercomputer-generated weather models
[2616.54 --> 2618.02]  that we rely on now.
[2618.04 --> 2619.44]  In full 3D with ray tracing.
[2619.44 --> 2624.88]  Yeah, so like, if there was a hurricane approaching the coast, they could be like, yeah, there's
[2624.88 --> 2625.82]  a hurricane a-coming.
[2626.16 --> 2626.42]  Yeah.
[2626.56 --> 2627.56]  But when we're-
[2627.56 --> 2630.40]  But now we're like, we can do facial recognition on it.
[2630.42 --> 2633.58]  Now we can do, yeah, that's Hurricane Jemima.
[2633.96 --> 2634.64]  We know.
[2635.68 --> 2639.26]  Well, nowadays, they'll be like, yeah, it's gonna rain for a few hours in the afternoon,
[2639.42 --> 2640.86]  and then it's probably gonna be sunny after that.
[2640.90 --> 2641.98]  It's like, no, no, that wasn't a thing.
[2642.12 --> 2642.92]  That wasn't a thing at all.
[2643.46 --> 2645.92]  I didn't check the weather when I was a kid.
[2645.92 --> 2649.58]  Like, so I can't really do that kind of correct, or direct comparison.
[2649.74 --> 2650.88]  I feel like-
[2650.88 --> 2652.48]  It's probably because you didn't read the newspaper.
[2653.54 --> 2655.14]  Well, I read the comics.
[2655.46 --> 2655.92]  Yeah, me too.
[2656.08 --> 2656.78]  That was all I read.
[2656.84 --> 2657.60]  I was just messing with you.
[2658.48 --> 2665.64]  So, on Thursday, NOAA's acting chief, Neil Jacobs, testified on Capitol Hill that the
[2665.64 --> 2670.50]  interference from new 5G wireless radios could reduce the accuracy of weather forecasting
[2670.50 --> 2672.30]  by as much as 30%.
[2672.30 --> 2673.58]  That's a significant chunk.
[2673.58 --> 2679.42]  He said this would result in coastal residents getting two to three fewer days to prepare
[2679.42 --> 2680.44]  for a hurricane.
[2680.60 --> 2680.92]  Ugh.
[2681.60 --> 2683.06]  Now, how does that make sense?
[2683.14 --> 2688.28]  I mean, surely, like, hurricanes that are two to three days away, you can collect data,
[2688.28 --> 2690.70]  like, way out there where there's not a lot of 5G signal.
[2690.70 --> 2693.34]  Well, I mean, maybe if it's close to the coast.
[2693.48 --> 2693.72]  All right.
[2693.94 --> 2695.84]  You know, you don't know whether it'll be a hurricane or not.
[2695.90 --> 2701.08]  And this could lead to less accurate predictions about where these major storms are going to make
[2701.08 --> 2701.64]  landfall.
[2701.64 --> 2705.80]  Such errors in these predictions could cost people their lives, he warned.
[2706.18 --> 2709.62]  At the cost of, uh, also we could have faster data speeds.
[2709.90 --> 2710.14]  Right.
[2710.24 --> 2710.84]  Is it worth it?
[2711.24 --> 2716.12]  The FCC began auctioning off the 24 gigahertz spectrum in March to wireless carriers who plan
[2716.12 --> 2717.56]  to use it for new 5G networks.
[2717.56 --> 2722.64]  And earlier this week, Democratic senators wrote a letter to the FCC asking that the agency
[2722.64 --> 2727.56]  refrain from issuing the licenses to auction winners until a solution can be found.
[2727.66 --> 2728.62]  You want to throw up the source?
[2728.82 --> 2729.66]  People are asking for it.
[2729.70 --> 2730.06]  Oh, yeah.
[2730.12 --> 2730.32]  Sorry.
[2730.38 --> 2733.00]  The source is, uh, CNET and The Verge.
[2733.32 --> 2733.90]  You know what?
[2733.90 --> 2735.44]  We're going to go with CNET.
[2735.80 --> 2736.02]  Oh.
[2736.02 --> 2737.38]  What?
[2737.64 --> 2738.92]  No, I'm just, it's a joke.
[2739.00 --> 2739.90]  I'm not biased.
[2740.12 --> 2744.32]  It's just, it's just, no, I don't want your notifications, though.
[2744.94 --> 2746.44]  Um, oh, man.
[2746.44 --> 2747.62]  Stop that autoplaying video.
[2747.62 --> 2747.70]  Oh, man.
[2747.84 --> 2748.16]  Wait.
[2748.36 --> 2748.58]  No.
[2748.58 --> 2749.58]  I like CNET.
[2749.58 --> 2749.78]  Stop.
[2750.30 --> 2751.76]  The autoplaying videos, you know?
[2752.26 --> 2752.78]  Stop.
[2754.54 --> 2758.54]  Man, I, space footage of storms is amazing.
[2758.66 --> 2759.32]  Awe-inspiring.
[2760.00 --> 2760.74]  It looks delicious.
[2761.18 --> 2764.18]  You know what's weird, though, is it really looks round from here.
[2764.86 --> 2765.60]  The Earth?
[2765.80 --> 2766.18]  Yeah.
[2767.14 --> 2768.40]  Were you, that's weird.
[2768.58 --> 2769.10]  You a flat?
[2769.10 --> 2771.10]  Oh, no, you know what it is?
[2771.10 --> 2771.38]  You a flat-Earther dude?
[2771.42 --> 2772.44]  You know what it is?
[2772.64 --> 2772.96]  Uh-oh.
[2773.06 --> 2778.56]  Is it's, see, I always thought that it was a rectangle, right?
[2778.70 --> 2780.68]  Because the map on the wall in school.
[2780.90 --> 2781.22]  Uh-huh.
[2781.40 --> 2784.02]  But actually, it's more of a pancake.
[2784.82 --> 2786.46]  That's why it looks round.
[2787.46 --> 2788.92]  I have no idea what you're talking about.
[2788.92 --> 2790.12]  I'm just, I'm just kidding.
[2792.16 --> 2794.46]  Wait, I need you to explain to me what you're talking about now.
[2794.66 --> 2796.32]  No, I was pretending to be a flat-Earther.
[2796.48 --> 2796.84]  Okay.
[2797.22 --> 2797.62]  Gotcha.
[2797.86 --> 2798.92]  I was just messing with you.
[2799.10 --> 2804.82]  So you know how sometimes you'll pretend to be offended so well that people think you're
[2804.82 --> 2805.50]  actually offended?
[2805.68 --> 2805.88]  Yeah.
[2805.88 --> 2810.96]  Sometimes I'll pretend to be an idiot so effectively that people think I'm actually an idiot.
[2811.10 --> 2811.84]  That's my whole life.
[2812.08 --> 2812.20]  Yeah.
[2814.66 --> 2816.94]  Wow, this WAN show just got really real.
[2818.52 --> 2819.00]  Okay.
[2819.64 --> 2820.50]  5G, though.
[2821.06 --> 2821.42]  Anyway.
[2821.42 --> 2827.68]  So the 24 gigahertz frequency band is really close to the 23.8 gigahertz that NOAA uses
[2827.68 --> 2829.08]  to collect data for weather prediction.
[2829.22 --> 2833.60]  And the concern is that they will interfere with the sensitive sensors on satellites that
[2833.60 --> 2834.82]  are monitoring atmospheric conditions.
[2834.92 --> 2835.04]  Okay.
[2835.10 --> 2836.00]  So that explains it.
[2836.14 --> 2840.50]  So if we're talking about satellites and just like general noise and interference,
[2840.50 --> 2845.98]  this is kind of like, you know, a bunch of people getting on their 5G phone and playing
[2845.98 --> 2853.48]  some PUBG all at once could result in kind of the weather monitoring equivalent of someone
[2853.48 --> 2858.32]  flipping on a microwave when you're trying to stream Netflix on a 2.4 gigahertz network.
[2858.40 --> 2858.66]  Right.
[2858.66 --> 2860.18]  Got it.
[2860.24 --> 2863.18]  Now, I thought the whole thing with 5G was that it's short range.
[2863.98 --> 2867.68]  That like, well, I guess in cities maybe it's more of an issue where like it'll be blocked
[2867.68 --> 2868.36]  by things.
[2868.76 --> 2873.90]  Well, remember too, though, that regardless of frequency, if you focus the signal enough,
[2873.96 --> 2875.24]  you can get incredible range.
[2875.24 --> 2880.00]  Like 2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi can be used over many kilometers if you have a point-to-point
[2880.00 --> 2880.56]  dish setup.
[2880.82 --> 2880.98]  Right.
[2881.10 --> 2887.16]  So without really deep knowledge of how the weather collection apparatus works, we can't
[2887.16 --> 2888.88]  say for certain what its range might be.
[2888.96 --> 2889.58]  Yeah, I don't know.
[2890.32 --> 2895.56]  So one suggestion has been that we could turn down the power emitted by 5G wireless radios
[2895.56 --> 2897.02]  to help prevent some of this interference.
[2897.82 --> 2904.56]  But obviously, if you turn down the power emitted by the wireless network, you're going to interfere
[2904.56 --> 2911.02]  with its range, which obviously the wireless carriers who just spent a lot of money for
[2911.02 --> 2914.18]  this spectrum are not going to be super stoked about.
[2914.38 --> 2919.06]  Now, I wonder how much of this is because most of the 5G deployment that we've seen so
[2919.06 --> 2921.04]  far is in cities, right?
[2921.12 --> 2925.72]  Where it's like, you know, there's a node on the corner of a building or something that'll
[2925.72 --> 2926.92]  cover a certain area.
[2927.14 --> 2928.52]  Like one block.
[2928.52 --> 2929.00]  Yeah.
[2929.18 --> 2933.08]  And we can be fairly certain that that's not going to like escape out and interfere
[2933.08 --> 2934.52]  with something or maybe it will.
[2934.62 --> 2934.98]  I don't know.
[2935.40 --> 2935.80]  I don't know.
[2936.02 --> 2942.20]  But I feel like I've seen a lot of talk about trying to build out an entire 5G network that
[2942.20 --> 2944.90]  has the same kind of coverage as 4G or LTE.
[2945.44 --> 2946.38]  But I don't think...
[2946.38 --> 2947.70]  I call BS on that, basically.
[2947.70 --> 2947.94]  Yeah.
[2948.24 --> 2953.68]  It doesn't seem like that will be a possible or desirable if this is true.
[2953.78 --> 2953.90]  Yeah.
[2953.90 --> 2957.98]  I think we've got to chalk that up to typical wireless carrier nonsense.
[2957.98 --> 2960.28]  I mean, you look at like the Canadian carriers.
[2960.44 --> 2962.10]  Oh, coast to coast coverage.
[2962.82 --> 2964.14]  And it's like...
[2964.14 --> 2964.32]  Yeah.
[2964.66 --> 2967.90]  They mean coast to coast like if you're in a major city.
[2968.18 --> 2971.04]  Here, let's have a look at the Rogers coverage map.
[2973.24 --> 2974.20]  Oh, Rogers.
[2975.14 --> 2978.32]  Oh, you guys are adorable.
[2978.32 --> 2979.32]  Yeah.
[2981.32 --> 2983.32]  I mean, if they can barely get LTE...
[2983.32 --> 2985.18]  Stay connected with Rogers Wireless.
[2985.58 --> 2986.92]  5G, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[2987.56 --> 2987.88]  Yeah.
[2988.14 --> 2989.70]  So Canada's a pretty big country.
[2990.76 --> 2991.24]  And...
[2991.24 --> 2992.04]  Oh my gosh.
[2992.14 --> 2992.96]  BC is so bad.
[2993.00 --> 2993.14]  Yeah.
[2993.16 --> 2994.74]  The white parts are not covered.
[2994.94 --> 2996.30]  Only the yellow parts are covered.
[2996.56 --> 2997.40]  So it's like...
[2997.40 --> 2997.54]  Yeah.
[2997.54 --> 2999.90]  The important areas like Toronto.
[3000.24 --> 3000.76]  Coast to coast.
[3000.98 --> 3002.58]  The center of Canada.
[3002.80 --> 3003.02]  Yeah.
[3003.86 --> 3004.86]  You know, newsflash.
[3005.00 --> 3006.52]  The center of Canada is more like here.
[3007.02 --> 3007.22]  Right.
[3007.22 --> 3008.00]  In northern Manitoba.
[3008.00 --> 3009.94]  We should be paying more attention to Manitoba.
[3010.02 --> 3010.32]  Yeah.
[3010.68 --> 3014.34]  You know, hey, Manitobans in the chat represent.
[3014.64 --> 3014.76]  Hey.
[3014.76 --> 3018.26]  If you're in rural Quebec, you are like...
[3018.26 --> 3020.16]  You better hope you have a landline
[3020.16 --> 3022.06]  because you certainly don't have wireless coverage.
[3022.16 --> 3022.62]  Actually, no.
[3022.68 --> 3024.34]  Rogers is particularly bad back east.
[3025.02 --> 3027.24]  What frequency spectrum is 5G going to operate in?
[3027.30 --> 3028.06]  24 gigahertz.
[3028.20 --> 3028.44]  Yes.
[3030.28 --> 3031.42]  We've got another topic.
[3031.68 --> 3033.84]  Now, you really wanted to talk about this.
[3033.84 --> 3035.84]  Let's go ahead and fire up the video.
[3036.70 --> 3037.92]  What did I want to talk about?
[3038.00 --> 3038.16]  Oh, super?
[3038.16 --> 3039.00]  You wanted to talk about this.
[3039.00 --> 3039.36]  I didn't...
[3039.36 --> 3039.86]  Well...
[3039.86 --> 3041.10]  No, you wanted to talk about it.
[3041.58 --> 3042.80]  I'm going to let you talk about it.
[3042.86 --> 3044.62]  So this is NVIDIA's teaser video.
[3044.70 --> 3046.40]  This could be an Uber card.
[3047.80 --> 3048.88]  Uber means super.
[3049.88 --> 3050.46]  Did you know?
[3051.32 --> 3052.24]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[3052.32 --> 3052.82]  That's German.
[3053.62 --> 3054.22]  Oh, no.
[3054.36 --> 3054.76]  Okay, yes.
[3054.84 --> 3055.10]  Uber.
[3055.48 --> 3055.66]  Yes.
[3055.74 --> 3056.40]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3056.48 --> 3057.84]  Not Uber like the cars.
[3058.02 --> 3058.82]  All right, all right, all right.
[3059.62 --> 3061.22]  We have no idea what that's going to be.
[3061.36 --> 3067.90]  It's a cryptic tweet talking about some kind of product that has super in the name or on
[3067.90 --> 3069.50]  the physical product or something.
[3069.50 --> 3070.98]  You said you wanted to speculate.
[3071.58 --> 3074.62]  I did not say that, but we can speculate.
[3074.72 --> 3074.96]  All right.
[3074.96 --> 3075.68]  You go first.
[3076.34 --> 3078.08]  It's probably a graphics card.
[3078.92 --> 3080.56]  So it was posted...
[3080.56 --> 3082.06]  Superpowered RTX 2080 Ti.
[3082.30 --> 3085.08]  It was posted from the GeForce account.
[3085.46 --> 3085.70]  Yes.
[3085.76 --> 3089.50]  Which would suggest that it has something to do with PC gaming.
[3089.80 --> 3089.96]  Mm.
[3090.84 --> 3091.76]  However...
[3091.76 --> 3092.22]  New shield.
[3092.44 --> 3092.92]  Super shield.
[3093.08 --> 3094.34]  That's actually, I think...
[3094.34 --> 3096.04]  Super soldier serum shields.
[3097.16 --> 3098.28]  There's going to be a...
[3098.28 --> 3100.36]  You know, like Captain America?
[3100.86 --> 3102.54]  Captain America's got the super soldier serum.
[3103.68 --> 3104.12]  Yeah, yeah.
[3104.22 --> 3104.86]  You know about that.
[3105.36 --> 3106.10]  It's been a while.
[3106.46 --> 3108.18]  Yeah, so they're going to have a shield.
[3108.86 --> 3109.46]  NVIDIA shield.
[3109.54 --> 3110.62]  Wait, they also have shield.
[3110.86 --> 3111.04]  Yeah.
[3111.08 --> 3111.88]  In Marvel.
[3112.16 --> 3112.30]  Yeah.
[3112.46 --> 3113.26]  Is that where you're going with this?
[3113.26 --> 3114.26]  No, I'm talking about NVIDIA shield.
[3114.28 --> 3115.06]  This is a different shield.
[3115.06 --> 3115.60]  The Android TV.
[3115.78 --> 3116.36]  It's a shield.
[3116.46 --> 3117.58]  Okay, are they not super?
[3117.58 --> 3117.66]  Super.
[3118.22 --> 3118.74]  They're...
[3118.74 --> 3119.56]  I don't know.
[3119.68 --> 3120.26]  I hope not.
[3120.92 --> 3121.28]  Okay.
[3122.50 --> 3123.46]  Here's my prediction.
[3123.68 --> 3123.92]  Yep.
[3124.38 --> 3126.24]  It's not a new product at all.
[3126.44 --> 3126.74]  Hold on.
[3126.76 --> 3128.38]  I'm going to bring up the video again real quick here.
[3128.52 --> 3128.88]  Uh-oh.
[3128.96 --> 3129.10]  Okay.
[3129.16 --> 3130.30]  Not a new product at all.
[3130.38 --> 3132.66]  And you know, too, because you have inside information.
[3132.94 --> 3133.70]  But rather...
[3133.70 --> 3134.64]  Yeah, everyone knows.
[3134.64 --> 3137.06]  Linus Media Group is wholly owned by NVIDIA.
[3137.06 --> 3137.98]  This is our parent company.
[3137.98 --> 3139.12]  Yeah, so you're an NVIDIA employee.
[3139.50 --> 3142.30]  There's a shocking number of people who actually seem to believe that.
[3142.40 --> 3142.56]  Yeah.
[3142.88 --> 3144.08]  Okay, so look at this.
[3144.16 --> 3144.50]  Look at this.
[3144.56 --> 3144.84]  Hold on.
[3144.88 --> 3145.16]  Hold on.
[3145.16 --> 3157.70]  I think that this is an intentional typo and that this is going to be a collaboration...
[3157.70 --> 3158.08]  With Supreme.
[3158.30 --> 3158.84]  With the...
[3158.84 --> 3159.36]  See?
[3159.66 --> 3159.96]  See?
[3160.22 --> 3162.18]  Do you get a Supreme vibe from that?
[3162.20 --> 3162.72]  No, that's the...
[3162.72 --> 3163.72]  That's a different font.
[3163.76 --> 3164.10]  Hold on.
[3164.14 --> 3164.42]  Hold on.
[3164.64 --> 3165.62]  Is it that different?
[3165.76 --> 3165.98]  Okay.
[3166.06 --> 3166.40]  Hold on.
[3166.44 --> 3166.70]  Hold on.
[3166.72 --> 3167.30]  We're going to switch.
[3167.98 --> 3168.96]  Where is it?
[3169.00 --> 3169.22]  Where is it?
[3169.22 --> 3169.70]  Okay, here we go.
[3169.74 --> 3170.04]  Here we go.
[3170.04 --> 3170.96]  That's not too many tabs, dude.
[3171.26 --> 3171.72]  So...
[3171.72 --> 3172.62]  That is too many tabs.
[3172.62 --> 3172.66]  Supreme.
[3173.86 --> 3174.52]  Oh, crap.
[3174.94 --> 3175.30]  Super.
[3177.04 --> 3177.48]  Supreme.
[3177.86 --> 3178.34]  Linus.
[3178.40 --> 3179.36]  Okay, they're pretty different.
[3179.42 --> 3180.56]  One font is serif.
[3180.62 --> 3181.90]  One is sans serif.
[3182.46 --> 3183.34]  I'm going with...
[3183.34 --> 3183.76]  Good gravy.
[3183.76 --> 3188.30]  I'm going with Super EME graphics card.
[3188.52 --> 3189.16]  Super Est.
[3189.48 --> 3191.22]  Super E.
[3191.32 --> 3192.30]  It's pretty Super E.
[3192.88 --> 3194.30]  Super EME.
[3194.72 --> 3195.50]  Super EME.
[3195.50 --> 3196.20]  I don't think so.
[3196.24 --> 3199.68]  I saw a couple of people online saying that, like, oh, it's got a collaboration with Supreme.
[3199.82 --> 3200.70]  I don't think so.
[3200.82 --> 3201.30]  I mean...
[3201.30 --> 3202.16]  No.
[3202.48 --> 3203.92]  James says, what could it be, though?
[3204.14 --> 3204.46]  Software?
[3206.84 --> 3209.90]  I mean, we know AMD is probably going to launch new GPUs.
[3210.48 --> 3210.76]  Okay?
[3210.76 --> 3215.94]  We've had a leak about Navi GPUs, so they're probably going to talk about those at Computex.
[3216.36 --> 3220.76]  So NVIDIA probably posted this to steal some of their thunder, and it's...
[3221.36 --> 3222.76]  I mean, my best guess...
[3222.76 --> 3223.16]  My best...
[3223.16 --> 3223.76]  I'm...
[3223.76 --> 3229.62]  I don't put money on things, but if I did, I would probably say that it's some sort of
[3229.62 --> 3233.96]  supercharged RTX 2080 Ti, because there's already a Titan RTX.
[3233.96 --> 3241.72]  So the last time NVIDIA used Super in their branding, and I'm not talking about EVGA with
[3241.72 --> 3245.40]  their super overclocked cards, was Super Phones.
[3245.90 --> 3248.42]  This was back in 2012, 2013.
[3249.06 --> 3249.20]  Oh.
[3249.20 --> 3253.58]  So here's a CNET video about an NVIDIA Super phone.
[3253.64 --> 3257.54]  I remember them actually bringing one to our office at NCIX.
[3257.78 --> 3258.84]  Is this like the...
[3258.84 --> 3261.54]  Oh, right, because they were like, okay, we've had the smartphone.
[3261.72 --> 3263.64]  Now it's the time for the next evolution.
[3264.16 --> 3264.76]  The Super phone.
[3264.76 --> 3265.70]  The Super phone.
[3266.02 --> 3266.38]  Yes.
[3266.90 --> 3268.06]  Oh, man, forget it.
[3268.16 --> 3269.56]  We're not doing this.
[3269.96 --> 3270.12]  Ads.
[3270.12 --> 3270.28]  Yes.
[3271.16 --> 3271.36]  Okay.
[3271.52 --> 3272.00]  Whatever.
[3272.18 --> 3277.62]  Anyway, the point was, they were going to put their Tegra processors in phones, and their
[3277.62 --> 3282.06]  Tegra processors weren't particularly amazing on the CPU side of things, but they had NVIDIA
[3282.06 --> 3284.64]  graphics technology in them, so they were going to be great for gaming.
[3284.92 --> 3285.14]  Right.
[3285.34 --> 3291.34]  And Super phones, I believe a couple of phones did actually end up getting at least announced
[3291.34 --> 3295.58]  with Tegra processors in them, but then it never went anywhere.
[3295.98 --> 3298.74]  It was a complete dead end.
[3298.74 --> 3301.16]  The iPhone was just completely dominant at that time.
[3301.28 --> 3302.52]  Yeah, this is way back six years ago.
[3302.52 --> 3305.96]  That's like the year that I started all this stuff, so I don't remember.
[3305.96 --> 3307.84]  And it was dead by 2013.
[3308.14 --> 3311.08]  It was like a 2012 kind of thing that they were talking about.
[3311.20 --> 3319.44]  So that, to me, might suggest that if they wanted like a Super tablet, that might be something
[3319.44 --> 3320.18]  to do with it.
[3320.42 --> 3320.76]  Oh!
[3321.84 --> 3323.38]  Maybe this is the...
[3323.38 --> 3328.34]  Because we've had a couple leaks and rumors this year about a new Shield gaming
[3328.34 --> 3329.56]  portable device.
[3329.68 --> 3334.46]  So maybe it's a refresh to Shield based on like their Super...
[3334.46 --> 3336.16]  What a dumb name though.
[3336.62 --> 3337.06]  Super?
[3337.52 --> 3338.12]  Super Shield?
[3338.94 --> 3340.94]  I mean, is it any...
[3340.94 --> 3341.68]  Is it any...
[3341.68 --> 3345.46]  Well, that's why I was like, oh, if it's a graphics card, I can see that because like
[3345.46 --> 3346.28]  what else...
[3346.28 --> 3349.44]  You know, they've got the TIs, they've got the SCs, they've got the OCs.
[3349.44 --> 3353.96]  He's like, how many more things can we put on the end of GPU names?
[3354.38 --> 3355.64]  Super is like, Super Edition.
[3355.86 --> 3356.38]  I'm like, okay.
[3357.02 --> 3358.22]  It's a weird adjective.
[3358.66 --> 3359.66]  Is it any dumber than...
[3359.66 --> 3360.04]  Super!
[3360.54 --> 3361.66]  Than like...
[3361.66 --> 3364.52]  Is it any dumber than Captain America?
[3364.84 --> 3365.66]  That was a joke.
[3365.78 --> 3367.06]  It says Super Serum.
[3367.32 --> 3367.50]  Or whatever.
[3367.64 --> 3368.66]  Like, no, no.
[3368.80 --> 3370.20]  Captain America is not a joke.
[3370.32 --> 3370.56]  Don't you talk...
[3370.56 --> 3371.66]  He's a very serious character.
[3371.66 --> 3372.16]  I agree.
[3372.26 --> 3374.28]  I was just going to say, don't you badmouth Captain America.
[3374.34 --> 3376.18]  I just mean, is it any dumber than that?
[3376.24 --> 3376.88]  He's a hero.
[3377.04 --> 3378.96]  Is it any dumber than Batman?
[3379.94 --> 3380.74]  Like, we...
[3380.74 --> 3381.16]  Wow.
[3381.44 --> 3389.52]  So, from my perspective, the validity of a brand really comes from how good the product
[3389.52 --> 3391.50]  is rather than the other way around.
[3391.60 --> 3391.82]  Right.
[3391.82 --> 3397.50]  It's not like you decide that a product is good based on hearing the name that makes
[3397.50 --> 3397.98]  you feel like...
[3397.98 --> 3401.52]  I can decide that the product name is dumb without knowing what the product is.
[3402.16 --> 3402.56]  Right.
[3402.68 --> 3407.34]  But over time, I postulate that you will accept it.
[3407.58 --> 3407.84]  Yeah.
[3408.16 --> 3411.70]  I bet you've accepted what a stupid name Kijiji is now.
[3412.40 --> 3413.48]  I've never used Kijiji.
[3414.34 --> 3415.82]  And I still think it's dumb.
[3415.84 --> 3416.04]  Okay.
[3416.06 --> 3416.76]  What about iPad?
[3417.06 --> 3418.22]  Have you accepted iPad?
[3419.50 --> 3421.44]  I mean, I accept it as a fact of life.
[3421.44 --> 3424.98]  We all thought it sounded like feminine hygiene products at the time.
[3427.46 --> 3428.70]  When's the last time you thought of that?
[3428.70 --> 3428.90]  Okay.
[3428.96 --> 3429.36]  How about this?
[3429.36 --> 3433.08]  Do you accept how Apple refers to its products without articles?
[3433.36 --> 3435.28]  Like, they don't say the MacBook Pro, a MacBook Pro.
[3435.28 --> 3437.28]  No, I actually do not accept that.
[3437.34 --> 3437.56]  Okay.
[3437.68 --> 3439.22]  Well, there we go.
[3439.22 --> 3441.56]  iPhone is an amazing experience.
[3441.76 --> 3444.02]  iPhone is not a proper noun, Apple.
[3444.38 --> 3445.54]  This eight-core processor...
[3445.54 --> 3446.36]  We didn't even talk about that.
[3446.44 --> 3449.58]  But this eight-core processor makes MacBook Pro the world's best MacBook.
[3449.70 --> 3450.16]  MacBook Pro.
[3450.30 --> 3451.10]  Makes the MacBook Pro?
[3451.10 --> 3451.40]  Okay.
[3451.54 --> 3455.34]  We should probably talk about that because that was sort of the...
[3455.34 --> 3455.62]  Okay.
[3456.18 --> 3457.02]  So...
[3457.02 --> 3459.48]  What do I call it then?
[3459.60 --> 3460.58]  New MacBook Pro.
[3461.38 --> 3462.56]  If I can't say the...
[3462.56 --> 3467.74]  It's just MacBook Pro with the type of display it has 2019.
[3468.46 --> 3469.06]  That's stupid.
[3469.18 --> 3471.10]  They should really start getting creative again.
[3471.42 --> 3471.68]  You know?
[3471.74 --> 3471.90]  Yeah.
[3472.66 --> 3473.48]  Like, go through...
[3473.48 --> 3474.92]  How about Super MacBook Pro?
[3476.30 --> 3477.74]  Super Book...
[3477.74 --> 3478.42]  Mac edition.
[3478.56 --> 3479.04]  Super Book.
[3479.10 --> 3480.84]  Well, Intel has their Muscle Books.
[3481.42 --> 3482.08]  Oh, yeah.
[3482.50 --> 3483.04]  That's going to be great.
[3483.04 --> 3487.50]  That's a name I decided was stupid and that I wouldn't like the product before it ever...
[3487.50 --> 3487.74]  Yeah.
[3487.74 --> 3489.02]  Before it ever actually happened.
[3489.42 --> 3489.58]  Okay.
[3489.94 --> 3490.78]  I like Muscle Books.
[3490.78 --> 3496.08]  Apple released a new MacBook Pro with Intel's new eight-core Core i9 processor.
[3496.24 --> 3499.08]  This is a crazy freaking mobile chip.
[3499.22 --> 3500.00]  It's not in here.
[3500.04 --> 3500.82]  Don't worry about it.
[3500.82 --> 3501.94]  And...
[3501.94 --> 3509.08]  Our immediate reaction to this device was that if Apple couldn't manage to tame the six-core
[3509.08 --> 3511.94]  Core i9 that was in the last-generation MacBook...
[3511.94 --> 3512.40]  Oh, right.
[3512.46 --> 3513.68]  Because that was the one that overheated.
[3513.80 --> 3514.58]  It was a six-core one.
[3514.58 --> 3514.68]  Yeah.
[3514.72 --> 3519.64]  That was the one that had the whole scandal around it where they didn't have the...
[3519.64 --> 3527.82]  Basically, the allowances in their software to let the CPU just go to 100, 105 degrees
[3527.82 --> 3528.72]  without throttling.
[3528.72 --> 3529.34]  Mm-hmm.
[3529.34 --> 3531.06]  So it was turning down.
[3531.16 --> 3535.78]  It was not performing the way it was supposed to, even underperforming the quad-core variant
[3535.78 --> 3536.96]  that had come before it.
[3537.18 --> 3537.60]  But they...
[3537.60 --> 3538.18]  Wait.
[3538.40 --> 3540.38]  They released an update, right?
[3540.38 --> 3544.02]  They released an update that fixed it in macOS but not in Windows.
[3544.44 --> 3550.26]  Because at the end of the day, what they were doing was they were kind of playing around with the power states
[3550.26 --> 3555.74]  and playing around with the thermal threshold to allow it to not drop below its base clock.
[3556.12 --> 3556.58]  But it was...
[3556.58 --> 3557.70]  I mean, it's cooking in there.
[3557.96 --> 3558.20]  Yeah.
[3558.34 --> 3559.82]  It's absolutely cooking in there.
[3560.24 --> 3567.30]  So we speculated that the new A-core MacBook Pro was not going to be a better situation for sure.
[3567.36 --> 3568.66]  So we figured it was going to thermal throttle.
[3568.66 --> 3575.12]  Now, Quinn from Snazzy Labs has already posted on Twitter that it doesn't thermal throttle.
[3575.24 --> 3581.44]  He says it just barely manages to maintain its base clock.
[3581.44 --> 3590.74]  However, I think you guys can always expect to get the non-Apple point of view from us.
[3590.86 --> 3593.14]  So we definitely have one on the way.
[3593.26 --> 3594.12]  It's already been ordered.
[3594.52 --> 3595.56]  Are you messaging me right now?
[3595.64 --> 3596.10]  Is that...
[3596.10 --> 3598.56]  Why don't you just come in and talk to me?
[3599.02 --> 3599.86]  Oh, man.
[3600.50 --> 3602.90]  It seemed like you had such a great rant going.
[3603.06 --> 3603.68]  Oh, maybe.
[3603.68 --> 3604.74]  Yeah, I didn't want to stop that.
[3606.82 --> 3607.56]  Okay, whatever.
[3607.56 --> 3613.46]  The point is, you can always expect the alternate side of the coin from us.
[3613.92 --> 3621.44]  So we are going to be addressing some of the criticisms of our last video about Apple's thermal throttling
[3621.44 --> 3628.60]  in our review of the MacBook Pro 8-core 2019 mid-retina, whatever the stupid thing is called.
[3629.64 --> 3630.90]  So stay tuned.
[3631.30 --> 3637.38]  Because from my perspective, there's a lot of different ways to define thermal throttling.
[3638.22 --> 3639.26]  So thermal.
[3640.10 --> 3644.46]  Okay, so you can say if it doesn't go below its base clock, it didn't thermal throttle.
[3645.06 --> 3646.38]  That's one way of defining it.
[3646.72 --> 3647.38]  That's correct.
[3648.18 --> 3651.82]  You can also say you got your one word, thermal.
[3652.74 --> 3653.66]  Okay, so it's heat.
[3654.06 --> 3654.24]  Yeah.
[3654.36 --> 3657.92]  You got your other word, throttle, which is vroom, vroom.
[3657.92 --> 3658.28]  Yeah.
[3658.56 --> 3658.88]  Okay.
[3658.88 --> 3658.96]  Okay.
[3659.84 --> 3666.26]  So anything other than the best that it could possibly perform, you could make the argument,
[3666.66 --> 3667.40]  is throttling.
[3668.00 --> 3673.80]  Now, the base clock is not the same thing as the all-core boost.
[3673.80 --> 3682.40]  So even if the laptop is maintaining its base clock per Intel spec, so that's what Intel rates
[3682.40 --> 3688.08]  it for with its TDP, like its thermal rating, that doesn't mean that if that chip didn't
[3688.08 --> 3692.34]  have a better cooling solution, it couldn't perform a lot better.
[3692.34 --> 3692.76]  Sure.
[3692.76 --> 3701.24]  So all-core boost is what Intel rates the chip to clock up to, assuming the power and thermal
[3701.24 --> 3703.80]  overhead is available for it to turn itself up.
[3703.88 --> 3708.18]  So these, I wonder if, does Mac, does Apple have like a specific list?
[3708.48 --> 3711.34]  Like, do they say this is the base clock, this is the boost clock?
[3711.74 --> 3714.34]  They only advertise boost, if I recall correctly.
[3714.36 --> 3715.32]  They only advertise boost clock?
[3715.32 --> 3717.08]  A lot of manufacturers do that.
[3717.38 --> 3720.48]  And we criticized Apple for it, and people were like, well, yeah, but what about?
[3720.96 --> 3725.28]  And so in our video, we're going to make a point of also criticizing other manufacturers
[3725.28 --> 3727.50]  for it, because it's stupid regardless of who does it.
[3727.50 --> 3732.88]  Because, you know, we talk about Apple a lot, but I'm sure a lot of these other, you know,
[3732.88 --> 3740.20]  Windows laptops with heat-intensive processors also don't get all the way up to their boost
[3740.20 --> 3740.98]  clocks all the time.
[3741.08 --> 3745.30]  So the thing that bothers me particularly about Apple is, and Quinn actually talked
[3745.32 --> 3749.98]  about this in his tweets, they advertise a boost clock that that chip is just never
[3749.98 --> 3750.44]  going to see.
[3751.66 --> 3752.42]  Apple does.
[3752.54 --> 3752.70]  Yeah.
[3752.88 --> 3753.08]  Right.
[3753.50 --> 3757.88]  Because they advertise a boost clock, but he's saying that it doesn't even, barely gets
[3757.88 --> 3758.96]  past the base clock.
[3758.96 --> 3763.50]  So the maximum boost clock is based on a single core or a two core load.
[3764.10 --> 3770.68]  And the base clock is based on the minimum that it should run at, at that thermal rating
[3770.68 --> 3774.88]  that Intel assigns to the processor for all cores being loaded.
[3774.88 --> 3777.26]  So they're completely different measures.
[3778.30 --> 3783.74]  But what he said was that it manages to maintain base clock in an all core load, and he didn't
[3783.74 --> 3788.66]  manage to see it hit its maximum advertised boost clock pretty much at all.
[3789.04 --> 3795.34]  But if it works fine, and if you, you know, you can go in GarageBand and make your little
[3795.34 --> 3800.38]  songs, then it, what's the, what's the difference?
[3800.38 --> 3801.42]  You know?
[3805.26 --> 3808.58]  I'm going to move on to Super Chats, because I'd rather talk to someone else right now.
[3808.58 --> 3810.30]  Hey, at least we'll remember to do them this time, eh?
[3810.62 --> 3811.12]  Yeah, well.
[3811.26 --> 3811.78]  Come on.
[3811.88 --> 3813.62]  Richard Lehman says, love your channel.
[3813.94 --> 3816.12]  It's given me many ideas for my new computer.
[3816.72 --> 3817.10]  Nice.
[3817.24 --> 3817.98]  No problem, Richard.
[3818.64 --> 3820.30]  Carlos says nothing.
[3820.96 --> 3821.60]  Love you, Carlos.
[3821.82 --> 3822.24]  Here's two bucks.
[3822.24 --> 3825.10]  Tommy Gunn, 1928.
[3825.72 --> 3827.50]  Were you born in 1928?
[3828.56 --> 3829.72]  I thought that was the question.
[3829.88 --> 3834.28]  We don't have a lot of, we don't have a lot of elderly viewers, but Tommy Gunn.
[3834.36 --> 3834.68]  All right.
[3835.08 --> 3836.84]  Hey, Linus, what laptop are you using during when?
[3837.20 --> 3839.26]  This is an HP something.
[3839.96 --> 3841.08]  Elite book of some sort.
[3841.18 --> 3841.50]  I don't know.
[3841.56 --> 3842.16]  It's not great.
[3842.24 --> 3843.04]  It's a fancy laptop.
[3843.14 --> 3844.28]  I'm not going to recommend it.
[3845.72 --> 3846.24]  Giovanni Giorgio.
[3846.24 --> 3851.44]  Oh, I daily drive a Razer Blade Stealth, but I don't know if I'm going to recommend that
[3851.44 --> 3853.70]  either because it's the old one, not the new one.
[3853.74 --> 3854.86]  I don't really like the new one that much.
[3854.90 --> 3857.12]  I need to find a new laptop that is like my go-to.
[3857.44 --> 3858.90]  I use the LG Gram 17.
[3859.88 --> 3860.80]  That one's pretty cool.
[3860.90 --> 3861.88]  I really wish it had a touchscreen.
[3862.34 --> 3862.54]  Yeah.
[3862.72 --> 3864.92]  I'd be super into it if it had a touchscreen.
[3865.46 --> 3865.76]  That's true.
[3865.76 --> 3867.34]  I'd be like, Riley, that's my gram now.
[3867.54 --> 3867.90]  Sorry.
[3868.22 --> 3869.52]  You could, that's fine.
[3871.20 --> 3873.26]  Eric, thoughts on Thunderbolt 3 for phones?
[3874.28 --> 3875.34]  I don't really have any.
[3876.24 --> 3878.68]  It sounds like unnecessary power consumption to me.
[3878.92 --> 3879.62]  I don't know what you'd do with it.
[3879.62 --> 3883.14]  Yeah, I don't know why you would, I mean, unless you want to use your phone as like a super
[3883.14 --> 3884.76]  powered flash drive or something.
[3884.92 --> 3890.80]  USB 3 Type-C already has many, many of the benefits of a Thunderbolt 3 port.
[3890.90 --> 3894.02]  Like if you wanted to run an external display and some peripherals or whatever off it, you
[3894.02 --> 3894.88]  can already do that.
[3895.26 --> 3899.50]  Maybe that'll be important when Android Q comes out because it might have a desktop mode.
[3900.06 --> 3901.68]  Even then, you could use Type-C for that.
[3901.90 --> 3904.36]  You do your display and your peripherals, your networking.
[3904.36 --> 3908.70]  It's like this right here is not a Thunderbolt dongle.
[3908.90 --> 3910.32]  It's just a USB Type-C dongle.
[3910.40 --> 3911.00]  You've got your HDMI.
[3911.30 --> 3913.12]  You've got your three USB ports.
[3913.22 --> 3914.50]  You've got your power pass through.
[3914.58 --> 3915.52]  You've got your gigabit LAN.
[3915.64 --> 3917.44]  You've got your micro SD and your SD card reader.
[3917.68 --> 3920.40]  Like this is all I could possibly want on a phone.
[3920.60 --> 3921.32]  And it's pink.
[3921.74 --> 3922.74]  And it's pink, isn't it?
[3923.14 --> 3923.72]  So that's fun.
[3923.86 --> 3924.12]  Yeah.
[3924.34 --> 3924.96]  I like it.
[3925.62 --> 3927.20]  Rose Gold, excuse me.
[3927.24 --> 3927.58]  Sorry.
[3928.22 --> 3928.62]  Sorry.
[3928.62 --> 3932.76]  Jeremy says, YouTube Premium gave me a free super chat to send.
[3933.18 --> 3933.34]  Yay.
[3933.66 --> 3933.96]  Thanks.
[3935.70 --> 3938.70]  Benny says, what do you think the best monitor is?
[3938.84 --> 3943.22]  I think the best monitor is coming and I need to make sure it's not under embargo before
[3943.22 --> 3944.84]  I tell you guys what it's going to be.
[3945.62 --> 3946.76]  One moment, please.
[3946.76 --> 3951.14]  The best monitor like out of every single option there is?
[3951.24 --> 3955.04]  That's a bold claim to try and make.
[3955.14 --> 3961.20]  I'm going for gaming just because that's like what I assume they're asking.
[3961.34 --> 3966.16]  That 4K 144Hz G-Sync.
[3967.86 --> 3971.06]  This embargo doesn't say anything about an embargo, so I'm going with it.
[3971.36 --> 3974.12]  Asus has their PG-35VQ coming.
[3974.12 --> 3984.40]  So it's a 3440 by 1440 ultrawide that does 200Hz and has like, I don't know, a bunch
[3984.40 --> 3990.98]  of dimming zones and HDR up the butt and like all that good stuff.
[3991.16 --> 3991.92]  So I'm going with...
[3991.92 --> 3992.18]  200Hz?
[3992.54 --> 3995.26]  I'm finally getting an upgrade for my Predator X34.
[3995.54 --> 3996.34]  It's going to be bigger.
[3996.52 --> 3996.72]  Can I have it?
[3996.72 --> 3997.48]  It's going to be badder.
[3998.34 --> 4000.10]  You already have one on your desk up there.
[4000.10 --> 4001.54]  I know better than to ask these things on the WAN show.
[4001.54 --> 4005.32]  So Jamaican says, hi, Riley.
[4006.00 --> 4006.68]  What's up, dude?
[4007.44 --> 4008.92]  Mikel says, yeah, he can't respond.
[4009.12 --> 4009.82]  So I don't...
[4009.82 --> 4010.66]  I'm just saying what's up.
[4010.82 --> 4012.12]  Mikel says, quick question.
[4012.18 --> 4013.86]  My computer will be an idle.
[4014.04 --> 4018.14]  While the mother is on or off, the computer will start revving really hard.
[4018.16 --> 4020.58]  And the only way I can get it back to work again is if I do a hard reset.
[4021.06 --> 4022.76]  Have you ever experienced this problem?
[4022.76 --> 4027.48]  My computer will be an idle.
[4027.48 --> 4031.52]  While the mother is on or off, the computer will start revving really hard.
[4032.14 --> 4033.16]  I do a hard reset.
[4034.28 --> 4034.72]  No.
[4035.46 --> 4036.82]  I've not experienced that problem.
[4036.92 --> 4037.58]  Hey, check...
[4037.58 --> 4038.54]  Post it in the forum.
[4038.98 --> 4039.30]  Yeah.
[4039.40 --> 4040.58]  That would be a really good idea.
[4040.70 --> 4042.26]  Post it on the linus-tech-tips.com forum.
[4043.56 --> 4046.50]  Other side guy says, collab with Mighty Car Mods when?
[4047.54 --> 4048.56]  Alex would die.
[4048.68 --> 4049.34]  He would love it.
[4049.34 --> 4051.36]  Yeah.
[4052.10 --> 4053.22]  I'd be pretty sick, actually.
[4053.68 --> 4057.06]  Andrew says, my girlfriend won't let me buy LTT shirts, saying I have too many.
[4057.34 --> 4058.00]  Look at this.
[4058.16 --> 4062.32]  Are you looking into making other LTT apparel, such as pants, socks, and beanies?
[4062.42 --> 4063.36]  Well, this is another shirt.
[4063.44 --> 4064.14]  That's another shirt.
[4064.22 --> 4065.82]  That's our new CPU design.
[4066.06 --> 4066.26]  Yeah.
[4066.40 --> 4069.62]  We also have the water bottles back in stock, LTTstore.com.
[4069.92 --> 4070.88]  We have hats.
[4071.14 --> 4071.92]  We got hats, dude.
[4072.00 --> 4073.40]  We're going to have boxers soon.
[4073.70 --> 4074.66]  Can you see the logo on...
[4074.66 --> 4075.74]  You know about the boxers, right?
[4075.96 --> 4076.32]  I do.
[4076.46 --> 4077.10]  Have you seen them?
[4077.10 --> 4077.98]  No, I haven't seen them.
[4078.08 --> 4079.14]  Oh, they're sick.
[4079.34 --> 4080.36]  Do I have them on me?
[4080.84 --> 4081.84]  Oh, we have a thing...
[4081.84 --> 4083.76]  We have a box full of...
[4083.76 --> 4085.08]  I was supposed to talk about this.
[4085.12 --> 4085.84]  I'm going to get in trouble.
[4086.08 --> 4087.60]  No, the boxers aren't in here.
[4089.62 --> 4090.02]  Yeah.
[4090.62 --> 4091.52]  Boxers aren't in there.
[4092.46 --> 4093.08]  Velcro straps.
[4093.32 --> 4093.68]  Cable ties.
[4095.28 --> 4098.32]  Jonathan says, why not 1440p next?
[4098.44 --> 4100.40]  That is actually a most excellent idea.
[4100.48 --> 4101.48]  We could do that on Floatplane.
[4101.48 --> 4105.80]  It still wouldn't address people being upset that, well, my 4K works.
[4106.16 --> 4106.40]  Yeah.
[4106.40 --> 4106.80]  It's a more else.
[4106.94 --> 4109.40]  If you got a 4K monitor, you're going to be like, 4040p.
[4110.88 --> 4116.46]  Michael says, go with super quality, but just call it low, medium, high, and ultra.
[4117.46 --> 4117.88]  Oh.
[4117.88 --> 4118.16]  Oh.
[4119.02 --> 4119.40]  Huh.
[4119.64 --> 4121.18]  So we could take like a...
[4121.90 --> 4123.24]  But that's deceitful.
[4123.48 --> 4124.02]  What is it?
[4124.06 --> 4125.16]  Duke Nukem or whatever?
[4125.30 --> 4127.18]  Where you've just got like...
[4127.18 --> 4135.06]  Instead of low, medium, high, you've got like, hurt me plenty, and like...
[4135.06 --> 4135.50]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4136.40 --> 4137.94]  False advertising, I think it's called.
[4138.00 --> 4139.38]  It burns my pee, you know?
[4139.38 --> 4139.58]  No.
[4141.52 --> 4141.88]  Okay.
[4142.24 --> 4142.88]  Don't...
[4142.88 --> 4144.24]  You shouldn't say that on the show, dude.
[4144.30 --> 4144.80]  That's private.
[4146.34 --> 4147.40]  Riley doesn't know.
[4147.54 --> 4148.50]  What are the odds?
[4148.66 --> 4150.96]  I feel like if we had looked at that at the time...
[4150.96 --> 4152.00]  Never tell me the odds.
[4152.08 --> 4153.28]  It might have made more sense.
[4154.10 --> 4155.42]  GIF is for the uncultured.
[4155.54 --> 4156.48]  Do you have a response?
[4157.46 --> 4158.26]  I have no response.
[4158.28 --> 4158.60]  Says Ryu.
[4159.16 --> 4162.00]  What happened in your life that you want to be mean to people like that?
[4163.14 --> 4164.12]  That's my response.
[4164.48 --> 4167.84]  Joe Scalin says, many U.S. carriers limit to 1.5 megabit per second.
[4167.84 --> 4169.32]  Yeah, we have separate files for mobile.
[4169.40 --> 4169.68]  Don't worry.
[4169.76 --> 4170.06]  It's okay.
[4172.70 --> 4174.22]  Chris says, have you tried the Quest?
[4174.64 --> 4175.22]  What do you think so far?
[4175.22 --> 4175.98]  Are we going to try it?
[4176.90 --> 4178.72]  I honestly didn't care.
[4179.50 --> 4180.64]  Everyone's saying it's really good.
[4180.90 --> 4183.76]  And I know that we don't do that much VR stuff anymore.
[4183.92 --> 4186.02]  And I'm not going to say, let's do VR stuff.
[4186.20 --> 4187.60]  But it seems like everyone loves it.
[4187.64 --> 4189.48]  We especially don't do a ton of mobile VR stuff.
[4189.60 --> 4190.08]  Because it's...
[4190.08 --> 4190.90]  Apparently it's really good.
[4191.46 --> 4191.96]  All right, fine.
[4192.28 --> 4192.76]  You're on it.
[4193.10 --> 4193.42]  Nice.
[4193.56 --> 4194.34]  That's your next assignment.
[4194.56 --> 4195.50]  Okay, Riley's on it.
[4195.86 --> 4196.28]  Sick, dude.
[4196.28 --> 4197.08]  Can you add it to Trello?
[4197.84 --> 4198.52]  All right.
[4198.66 --> 4199.06]  Right now.
[4199.24 --> 4201.14]  I'm not signed in to anything, so I can't.
[4205.02 --> 4209.94]  Zion says, GeForce experience with ray tracing update for superior performance.
[4210.74 --> 4212.78]  Look at the light shading and rendering in the teaser.
[4212.98 --> 4217.12]  I think NVIDIA makes all their teasers look sexy, regardless of what the tech is.
[4217.48 --> 4218.78]  Oh, he's saying the super...
[4218.78 --> 4219.00]  Yeah.
[4219.22 --> 4219.42]  Wait, what?
[4219.58 --> 4220.34]  So it's going to be...
[4220.34 --> 4221.48]  He's saying that it's going to be...
[4221.48 --> 4223.60]  Super is going to be an update to ray tracing?
[4223.80 --> 4224.88]  Yeah, I kind of doubt it.
[4224.98 --> 4225.16]  Eh.
[4225.92 --> 4226.32]  Maybe.
[4226.32 --> 4227.32]  Here's another one.
[4227.40 --> 4230.64]  Here's the money I got from buying YouTube red, says Kian.
[4231.68 --> 4232.04]  Nice.
[4233.00 --> 4236.86]  Tech support says, super is a dumb name, but so is Linus Tech Tips.
[4237.34 --> 4238.52]  I don't even disagree.
[4240.22 --> 4242.90]  D says, Corey, lol, you don't know.
[4242.96 --> 4243.98]  I just tried it tonight.
[4244.54 --> 4245.14]  I'm waiting...
[4245.14 --> 4245.50]  So now...
[4245.50 --> 4246.28]  Wait.
[4246.36 --> 4250.00]  People are sending super chats to talk to other people in the chat?
[4250.84 --> 4251.24]  Okay.
[4251.30 --> 4252.84]  I'm waiting for the marriage proposal then.
[4252.84 --> 4253.56]  Oh, man.
[4253.62 --> 4255.34]  Like, I've seen you in the super chats.
[4255.70 --> 4256.34]  It's like a...
[4256.34 --> 4258.52]  It's like a personal...
[4258.52 --> 4259.28]  What do you call those?
[4259.46 --> 4260.04]  The personals?
[4261.48 --> 4262.58]  Yeah, I think that's...
[4262.58 --> 4263.00]  In newspapers?
[4263.00 --> 4263.32]  Classifieds?
[4263.56 --> 4264.00]  Classifieds.
[4264.16 --> 4264.56]  No.
[4264.56 --> 4265.56]  No, that's...
[4265.56 --> 4266.04]  Personals.
[4266.42 --> 4266.78]  Personals.
[4266.78 --> 4266.92]  Yeah.
[4266.92 --> 4268.24]  Like, I saw you on the bus.
[4269.26 --> 4270.42]  Let's get a coffee.
[4272.08 --> 4275.20]  Tejas says, Apple mentions both bass and boost clock.
[4275.32 --> 4277.50]  So for the video, we're going to go through.
[4277.56 --> 4278.54]  We're going to research it thoroughly.
[4278.78 --> 4279.30]  Don't worry.
[4279.42 --> 4280.34]  We're going to have some fun with it.
[4280.88 --> 4285.28]  Speaking of having fun, it's time for me to go home and have some fun packing.
[4285.66 --> 4286.06]  Yeah.
[4286.24 --> 4287.12]  Go to that Computex.
[4287.14 --> 4287.76]  You're heading to Taiwan.
[4288.04 --> 4288.14]  Yeah.
[4288.14 --> 4289.12]  How did you get out of it?
[4289.82 --> 4291.88]  Because I thought we were going to send you for Quick Bits.
[4291.88 --> 4294.58]  Yeah, I think I made an argument that it might not be worth it.
[4295.44 --> 4296.68]  Well, right.
[4296.78 --> 4299.24]  And then it was going to cost me, like, a couple grand to send you there.
[4299.36 --> 4299.64]  Yeah.
[4300.02 --> 4304.34]  And I'll probably just end up kind of, like, doing the same thing that I do here mostly
[4304.34 --> 4304.70]  anyway.
[4304.88 --> 4306.64]  So maybe the next event.
[4307.62 --> 4309.48]  But, like, it's a one-day...
[4309.48 --> 4311.56]  The thing is, it's a one-day production cycle.
[4311.68 --> 4313.80]  So it's, like, it's hard to do any time you're on an event.
[4314.34 --> 4316.44]  I've gone to many events and done TechLink now.
[4316.44 --> 4317.26]  You could send you to E3.
[4317.28 --> 4318.06]  I know what I'm in for.
[4318.96 --> 4321.44]  Yeah, there's apparently going to be some hardware announcements.
[4321.44 --> 4322.10]  But we'll see.
[4322.86 --> 4323.10]  Okay.
[4323.18 --> 4324.04]  Maybe a new Xbox.
[4324.18 --> 4324.76]  You want to go to E3?
[4326.16 --> 4327.10]  We talked about this before.
[4327.10 --> 4330.20]  We also know that there's, like, Switch refreshes supposedly coming.
[4330.80 --> 4332.42]  Sony announced the PlayStation 5.
[4333.38 --> 4336.26]  Yeah, but they're not going to reveal that until...
[4336.26 --> 4338.18]  Switch, I think, is coming after E3.
[4338.46 --> 4340.56]  And Xbox might be coming at E3.
[4340.64 --> 4340.94]  Which one?
[4341.00 --> 4344.40]  Is it Sony that for the first time ever isn't going to have an E3 presence at all?
[4344.42 --> 4344.68]  Yes.
[4344.76 --> 4345.22]  Yeah, okay.
[4345.34 --> 4346.04]  They're not going to be there.
[4346.04 --> 4347.04]  They're definitely not doing it.
[4347.04 --> 4350.68]  Then again, maybe they'll throw their own E3 down the street.
[4350.68 --> 4352.28]  I think they did that.
[4352.60 --> 4353.84]  That's, like, the pettiest thing ever.
[4353.96 --> 4359.24]  I still remember when NVIDIA launched G-Sync, AMD had their own event literally at the hotel
[4359.24 --> 4359.96]  down the street.
[4361.10 --> 4361.82]  And they were like...
[4361.82 --> 4363.00]  But did they even have FreeSync yet?
[4363.32 --> 4363.64]  No.
[4363.78 --> 4365.00]  They were just like, look, we got stuff.
[4365.04 --> 4366.98]  No, they were just like, here, look at this graphics card.
[4367.22 --> 4367.40]  Yeah.
[4367.40 --> 4374.12]  And because everyone had traveled there on NVIDIA's dime, it was, like, really kind of rude.
[4374.48 --> 4376.64]  But then NVIDIA was super petty about it.
[4377.04 --> 4381.42]  Now, I haven't verified this, so it might not be true, but I heard other editors telling me
[4381.42 --> 4385.58]  that NVIDIA had someone outside the hotel watching who was leaving to go to the AMD thing or not.
[4386.08 --> 4386.88]  It's amazing.
[4386.96 --> 4387.54]  It's amazing.
[4387.72 --> 4389.82]  You would think these are, like, adults.
[4389.82 --> 4392.00]  I mean, I don't know.
[4392.52 --> 4393.46]  It's fair enough.
[4393.56 --> 4398.52]  AMD also, like, named their products, like, you know, the X399 and stuff.
[4398.52 --> 4400.34]  Yeah, Ryzen 3, 5, and 7.
[4400.44 --> 4402.40]  And they might be naming their new GPUs.
[4402.42 --> 4402.96]  Have you seen this?
[4403.02 --> 4404.16]  The RX3080?
[4405.06 --> 4405.40]  Really?
[4405.50 --> 4406.78]  And the RX3070?
[4407.54 --> 4408.24]  They might.
[4408.34 --> 4408.62]  They might.
[4408.72 --> 4409.62]  That's the rumor.
[4409.80 --> 4413.50]  I hope not, because they already created enough trouble when they called Threadripper's chips
[4413.50 --> 4414.48]  at X399.
[4414.54 --> 4414.78]  Right.
[4415.22 --> 4417.24]  Because Intel's was X299.
[4417.24 --> 4417.64]  Yeah.
[4418.10 --> 4425.24]  But then X299 was stupid, because they went from X58 to X...
[4425.24 --> 4425.82]  Okay, so hold on.
[4425.84 --> 4426.48]  Let's go way back.
[4426.60 --> 4429.16]  You've got your X38, your X48, your X58.
[4429.34 --> 4430.34]  So there's a bit of a pattern here.
[4430.50 --> 4430.64]  Right.
[4430.82 --> 4431.18]  X68?
[4431.52 --> 4432.12]  Nowhere to be seen.
[4432.32 --> 4433.54]  You've got your X79.
[4433.72 --> 4434.22]  Oh, yeah.
[4434.40 --> 4434.68]  Okay?
[4435.28 --> 4436.42]  And then from there, they went to...
[4436.42 --> 4436.76]  Then no X89.
[4437.12 --> 4438.22]  We went to X99.
[4438.44 --> 4438.84]  X99.
[4439.22 --> 4439.40]  Yeah.
[4439.62 --> 4443.22]  Then we just arbitrarily went to X299.
[4443.22 --> 4443.46]  X299.
[4443.64 --> 4445.30]  Instead of, like, X119 or something.
[4445.30 --> 4450.48]  So maybe Intel's plan is to go X499 and leapfrog AMD?
[4450.66 --> 4451.10]  I don't know.
[4451.30 --> 4451.82]  It's...
[4451.82 --> 4452.66]  They're children.
[4452.84 --> 4453.54]  Everyone is children.
[4453.76 --> 4454.02]  That's...
[4454.02 --> 4454.12]  Yeah, it's dumb.
[4454.30 --> 4457.14]  If there's anything I've learned in life, it's that you...
[4457.14 --> 4458.50]  You're born...
[4458.50 --> 4459.02]  You're born.
[4459.18 --> 4459.30]  You grow up.
[4459.30 --> 4460.80]  You go to elementary school.
[4460.86 --> 4461.08]  Yeah.
[4461.72 --> 4462.58]  And that's it.
[4462.66 --> 4462.76]  You peak.
[4462.76 --> 4464.56]  And then it's just from there on, it's...
[4464.56 --> 4464.80]  You get...
[4464.80 --> 4464.96]  Yeah.
[4465.02 --> 4466.54]  You become a bigger fourth grader.
[4466.58 --> 4468.88]  That's the amount of maturity that you reach.
[4469.06 --> 4469.52]  And that's...
[4469.52 --> 4470.08]  If you're Linus.
[4470.08 --> 4471.10]  And that's the way I like it.
[4471.10 --> 4471.60]  All right.
[4471.80 --> 4472.74]  So tune in next week.
[4473.04 --> 4473.78]  Same bad time.
[4473.90 --> 4474.76]  Same bad channel.
[4474.76 --> 4477.66]  I will be in Taiwan, so I don't know who's going to be hosting it.
[4477.68 --> 4478.56]  But it'll be someone cool.
[4478.68 --> 4480.18]  Maybe Riley, because he's not going.
[4480.36 --> 4480.74]  WAN show?
[4481.04 --> 4481.58]  Yeah, WAN show.
[4481.68 --> 4482.02]  Oh, yeah.
[4482.34 --> 4482.54]  Maybe.
[4483.02 --> 4483.68]  See you, guys.
[4483.88 --> 4484.78]  See you later.
[4486.66 --> 4488.82]  And you got to make sure that you hit the right button.
[4489.58 --> 4489.86]  Yeah, yeah.
[4489.88 --> 4490.46]  When you end it?
[4490.66 --> 4490.94]  Yeah, yeah.
[4490.98 --> 4491.20]  No, no.
[4491.22 --> 4492.72]  I already changed the default behavior.
[4493.12 --> 4493.36]  Wait.
[4493.52 --> 4493.90]  No, no, no.
[4493.98 --> 4494.70]  On...
[4494.70 --> 4495.56]  In this one.
[4496.00 --> 4496.60]  In this one.
[4496.94 --> 4498.16]  I pressed...
[4498.16 --> 4498.40]  Oh, no.
[4498.44 --> 4499.30]  I know how to do that.
[4499.50 --> 4499.70]  Yeah.
[4499.88 --> 4500.54]  Well, that's what I did.
[4500.54 --> 4501.92]  That's a non-issue.
[4502.12 --> 4502.26]  Yeah.
[4502.42 --> 4503.58]  See, I'm you in this.
[4503.66 --> 4504.60]  I dropped the couch first.
[4504.60 --> 4507.00]  Yeah, there was another problem last time, actually.
[4507.18 --> 4508.40]  It was that...
[4508.40 --> 4509.72]  Oh, the sponsors were...
[4509.72 --> 4510.12]  No, no.
[4510.18 --> 4510.66]  Not that.
[4511.22 --> 4512.78]  There was another more different problem.
[4512.94 --> 4515.16]  It was actually that this button,
[4515.28 --> 4517.06]  Make Archive Unlisted When Complete,
[4517.16 --> 4518.60]  was checked by default for a while.
[4519.00 --> 4519.38]  So that's...
