I haven't watched the wan show since before the holidays but this episode was particularly bad. More than half of the video was linus-related news, the only news was the facetime bug, and then the show "ends" TWICE before they get to the topic that they named the video after? And the topic is less than a minute long? Is this what the wan show is nowadays?

bonus timestamp: 49:55 "Should be ready by the time the show ends" but the show had already ended twice at that point :thinking:

Thumbs down because of no timestamps. Who wants to hear you jibber jabber  for 50 minutes? I want to see what the title and thumbnail show.
