[0.00 → 7.88] And welcome to the WAN Show, ladies and gentlemen.
[9.32 → 9.98] Don't worry.
[13.16 → 13.80] Don't worry.
[13.88 → 15.48] Old Luke will be coming to the show.
[15.56 → 19.18] I put him in the thumbnail, so I didn't want people to feel like I misled them.
[19.18 → 20.16] The old bait and switch.
[20.28 → 20.52] Yep.
[20.68 → 22.10] Why am I sitting so high?
[22.66 → 23.24] Is this?
[24.04 → 28.98] You know, despite having shorter legs than me, you always have your chair as high as I keep mine.
[28.98 → 30.34] Well, no, it's too high.
[30.84 → 31.86] I don't know how to adjust it.
[32.24 → 33.38] This isn't my usual chair.
[33.90 → 34.46] Oh, right.
[34.52 → 35.70] This is the RGB chair.
[36.26 → 36.78] But I don't...
[36.78 → 38.32] You don't even have your RGB on.
[38.92 → 39.96] Well, I'm trying to...
[39.96 → 41.48] It's going to be a great show, folks.
[41.76 → 42.04] Yeah.
[42.38 → 42.66] Yeah.
[42.80 → 43.48] It's going to be great.
[43.48 → 48.98] So we're going to be talking Intel slashing the pricing on their 9th Gen Skylike X processors.
[49.60 → 50.06] It's funny.
[50.16 → 53.28] Intel's having a super, super weird week.
[53.28 → 60.36] On the one hand, they beat their Q3 earnings expectations by a significant margin.
[60.48 → 62.26] Their shares jumped like 8% today.
[62.60 → 69.72] And then on the other side of the coin, they're kind of fighting this race to zero battle against AMD on their processor pricing.
[70.46 → 75.40] In other news, TCL unveiled a trifling phone.
[75.40 → 80.52] And as a folding phone fanboy, I can't wait to hear what you think of it.
[80.56 → 80.92] Yeah.
[81.22 → 83.46] I try to do more FS than I should up there.
[83.86 → 84.88] And Shroud moves to Mixer.
[85.04 → 86.02] All this and more.
[87.06 → 89.36] After these messages from our intro.
[89.68 → 90.22] Awesome intro.
[92.60 → 93.78] Man, this is so cool.
[94.06 → 97.40] You know, just to throw people for a loop sometimes, we should run the ancient...
[99.40 → 99.96] Stop.
[99.96 → 117.12] PIA.
[117.98 → 119.40] It just means nothing.
[119.54 → 120.24] Blank white.
[120.48 → 121.30] More PIA.
[121.66 → 122.00] Hold on.
[122.08 → 122.54] Here it goes.
[122.86 → 123.24] Here it goes.
[123.34 → 123.90] Oh, yeah.
[124.06 → 124.80] There it is.
[125.02 → 125.88] I'm in Egypt.
[126.12 → 127.22] What's up now?
[127.78 → 128.38] I'm elsewhere.
[128.38 → 130.66] No, he's also in Egypt.
[130.84 → 131.14] Oh, okay.
[131.14 → 132.36] But he's in like a tomb.
[132.48 → 134.42] And then they're in front of a couch.
[134.50 → 134.70] Yeah.
[135.04 → 138.78] Didn't this intro change like every show or periodically originally?
[139.08 → 139.34] Well, no.
[139.42 → 141.92] The idea was that we would change it periodically.
[142.24 → 146.60] So there was the one where I'm by the pyramid and then Luke's in the thing.
[146.74 → 147.00] Hold on.
[147.10 → 149.48] Just relax for a second, okay?
[149.58 → 152.94] So there's the one where I'm going by the pyramid and then Luke has the spikes chasing him.
[153.20 → 157.50] And then there's the one with me in the swamp and Luke doing whatever he's doing.
[158.34 → 162.20] And the idea was that they would kind of change once a month.
[162.40 → 164.78] And then we just never did a third one.
[164.98 → 167.86] Like the way that we operate and being so busy all the time.
[167.94 → 172.56] Like the fact that you thought that we were going to do something that was non-essential on a regular basis.
[172.58 → 173.62] We're basically Valve.
[174.80 → 177.56] We're going to do episodic when show intro.
[177.96 → 178.72] First episode.
[178.88 → 179.26] Second episode.
[179.44 → 179.88] Dead.
[180.18 → 180.46] Forget.
[180.78 → 181.66] Forget about it.
[181.68 → 182.50] You're playing two forever.
[182.92 → 183.06] Yeah.
[183.14 → 184.92] Five years later.
[184.92 → 187.32] All right.
[187.44 → 190.06] So why don't we jump right into our first topic of the day.
[190.26 → 197.84] Intel is rumoured to be slashing the pricing in half of their 9th Gen Skylike X processors.
[197.98 → 205.76] So this is a report from computerbase.de that claims that Intel is planning to cut pricing of their older 9th Gen Skylike processors in half.
[205.76 → 208.88] So let's go ahead and fire up our source here.
[209.28 → 211.12] WCCF Tech is reporting on this, apparently.
[211.72 → 213.28] And I don't have the chart.
[213.40 → 214.74] So I'm just going to pull up their article.
[215.88 → 216.48] I mean.
[216.70 → 217.00] There's a chart in there.
[217.18 → 217.50] There it is.
[217.50 → 226.14] Honestly, this kind of makes sense to me given that they already, we already have a pretty good idea of what pricing of the 10 series is going to be.
[226.14 → 241.06] And in order for the 10 series to make any, or in order for them to move their remaining stock of 9 series, given the much lower pricing of their 10 series, there was no way that they could just leave the pricing where it was.
[241.06 → 242.66] So here we go.
[242.74 → 243.90] The 9800X.
[243.96 → 249.62] So that's the 8 core 16 thread processor that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.
[249.62 → 256.62] Now that we have an 8 core chip on the consumer platform is dropping to just 360 euros.
[256.82 → 259.48] I mean, that's not bad if you can pick up a used motherboard or something.
[260.60 → 262.00] The 9820X.
[262.04 → 266.52] So there's your 10 core is dropping from $889 to approximately 520 euros.
[266.52 → 277.20] Now bear in mind, guys, that these prices are not directly comparable dollar to dollar, but you also can't just do a straight currency conversion and go.
[277.32 → 279.54] Which would be 576 US dollars, by the way.
[279.66 → 279.98] Yeah.
[280.26 → 283.00] Oh, so that's on the 520 euros.
[283.08 → 283.20] Yeah.
[283.26 → 292.98] You can't necessarily just do a straight currency conversion because a lot of the time there's regional pricing for these products and there are taxes that are included or are not included.
[292.98 → 302.54] So probably what would end up happening is that 520 euros is going to end up being closer to like $520.
[303.06 → 308.00] As much as that is a gigantic FM to European customers in many cases.
[308.00 → 320.90] Like, honestly, if I was a phone manufacturer or like a graphics card maker or whatever else, and I had figured out that the market will bear a higher overall income for me.
[321.10 → 327.64] Like if I just charge the same price, but like in Great Britain pounds or euros.
[328.76 → 333.28] Wouldn't I just send all my allocation there for a product that I can't produce enough of?
[333.28 → 339.82] Maybe, but it just depends on if there's enough demand there compared to what you're producing.
[340.48 → 341.32] I guess that's fair.
[341.94 → 358.10] I mean, I know that there have been cases where, especially at launch on a highly constrained product, like a graphics card, for instance, where a lot of the time, like going back to my days at NCI, some new hot graphics card, like the GTX 480.
[358.10 → 359.70] Get it hot?
[359.94 → 361.10] Actually, no one was buying those.
[362.00 → 366.62] But something people actually wanted, like let's say the GTX 580.
[366.74 → 368.60] That was a much more significant launch.
[369.00 → 380.42] It'll come out, and you oftentimes don't know how many cards you're getting until a day or two before the card actually launches.
[380.42 → 386.52] So, like it's madness, honestly, because you haven't seen how many of these are going to move.
[386.74 → 389.32] As a retailer, you don't have any.
[389.74 → 392.74] You're not testing them and finding out if they're any good.
[393.24 → 395.22] You don't even know pricing sometimes.
[395.56 → 404.24] So a manufacturer like VGA, their expectation, if you want to get any cards at all, is you basically just hand them a blank PO.
[404.24 → 410.00] So here's a purchase order for however many you can send at whatever price it is.
[410.66 → 412.02] And we'll try our best to sell it.
[412.44 → 412.60] Yeah.
[412.70 → 425.24] So in the case now with these people who have the Skylike stuff, if they bought all of these things, they bought all of it for a certain price, then Intel is like actually it's half now.
[425.48 → 427.08] Is Intel going to subsidize?
[427.08 → 427.48] Yes.
[427.62 → 433.48] So the way that typically works is they would do something called a POS rebate, a point of sale rebate.
[433.66 → 441.92] So you don't just get a big fat check to write down all the inventory that you have in your warehouse because, oh, I don't know.
[442.02 → 444.04] I guess that would just be too sensible.
[444.04 → 462.56] So instead, what you get is you generate a sell-through report that you send back to, depending on what tier of reseller you are, you might send it back directly to Intel, and they will send you a check like quarterly or monthly or whatever the case may be based on your sell-through.
[463.14 → 467.08] So what frigging difference that makes, I'm not sure.
[467.08 → 473.58] And then as for the inventory that's not in Intel's warehouse, Intel will just mark it down themselves on anything they're still holding.
[473.96 → 478.66] And then the retailer will either claim it back through Intel or through a distributor.
[479.00 → 482.24] So if you're a lower tier reseller, you're probably claiming it back through distributor.
[482.54 → 486.20] If you're at the very bottom of the barrel, there's probably no protection for you whatsoever.
[486.20 → 494.20] But if you're a distributor, then a lot of the time what will happen is Intel will provide them with what's called a sell-through rebate, which is very, very similar.
[494.74 → 500.06] And as they sell through to the retailer at that lower price, they will apply for their rebate back to Intel.
[500.14 → 504.58] So does the time that it takes for you to get your money increase the farther from Intel you are?
[505.16 → 508.86] Not necessarily, as long as you've got a direct relationship.
[508.86 → 514.06] So the thing is, Intel doesn't sell directly to any retailers, as far as I'm aware.
[514.16 → 522.86] Even if you're a New egg, my understanding is that you still buy through a DNH or Cine, ASI, Ingram Micro, one of those kinds of companies.
[523.46 → 533.36] And that is so that, at least this is my understanding, Intel, from a logistics standpoint, doesn't have to be shipping directly to too many different locations.
[533.36 → 538.48] Now, Dell, to my knowledge, does get direct shipments from Intel, but that's different.
[538.58 → 540.06] That's on the OEM side of the business.
[541.42 → 543.52] So I forget what your question was.
[543.68 → 544.22] You answered it.
[544.46 → 544.96] Okay, cool.
[547.54 → 550.64] So the other rumour is that this is going to extend beyond just Skylike.
[551.36 → 551.90] That makes sense.
[553.48 → 556.08] I guess we haven't really talked through some of the other price drops.
[556.18 → 559.56] So 9980XE is dropping back down to what it should have been in the first place.
[559.56 → 562.12] So it's around $2,000.
[562.12 → 569.80] It's dropping all the way down to €950, which used to be what an Extreme Edition costs until Intel was like,
[570.18 → 570.62] Ha ha!
[571.52 → 573.00] AMD will never catch up!
[573.22 → 573.92] Ha ha ha ha!
[574.46 → 578.40] And then charged $2,000 for their top-end gaming chip.
[578.50 → 583.86] And then one generation later, okay, it's a grand now.
[583.86 → 588.64] Turns out we can sell it for $1,000.
[589.44 → 590.96] That was just, you know what?
[590.96 → 593.24] The, uh, there's glitch in the system.
[595.64 → 597.04] I just don't get it.
[597.70 → 598.82] Sounds like you get it.
[598.90 → 601.62] Yeah, this is a very unusual move for them.
[601.88 → 609.06] It's more typical for them to just leave old processors to trickle out at the rate that they do.
[609.06 → 619.20] Um, or rather than lowering the MSRP, do small sell-through rebates or, uh, and this is even more common than that, do bundle rebates.
[619.20 → 626.16] So, the thing is, Intel has a bunch of chips to move, but their partners also have not just motherboards.
[626.16 → 635.76] Because you've got to remember, the way that someone like an MSI or SUS or a Gigabyte stocks motherboards is not necessarily as completed units inside boxes.
[636.02 → 638.20] They stock motherboard pieces.
[638.20 → 645.28] So, Gigabyte might have, let's say, 35,000, you know, motherboards in stock.
[645.28 → 653.28] But they might have another 150,000 chipsets for the motherboards that they would make to go with these CPUs.
[653.28 → 661.66] So, Intel has to support a variety of different partners as they're moving an old product out of their inventory.
[662.04 → 666.64] So, they've got to support the retailers with the aforementioned POS rebates.
[666.82 → 670.04] They've got to support their distributors with their sell-through rebates.
[670.12 → 672.70] They've got to support the OEMs in whatever way they do those.
[672.78 → 677.38] I suspect they get really deep discounts so that they can blow out old systems in much the same way.
[677.38 → 690.92] And then they've got to support the guys who make the supporting pieces because it's not going to do you any good to provide a POS rebate on this processor if no motherboard exists for anyone to plug it into.
[691.06 → 692.16] Who would buy it?
[692.42 → 697.30] So, they're going to go out, and they're going to say, okay, guys, you know, how many chipsets do you have in stock?
[697.42 → 699.76] We're going to EOL this at such and such a time.
[699.76 → 708.10] And, okay, yeah, we can provide you with – and you'd be surprised how laughable the discounts that get provided a lot of the time are.
[708.16 → 712.58] Like, we'll provide you with a $2.80, you know, sell-through rebate.
[712.90 → 718.98] But then, if there's also a sell-through rebate on the CPU, well, then the retailer takes that board and that CPU.
[718.98 → 720.90] And, okay, I've got $3.
[721.06 → 722.80] Okay, $2.80 was probably a little low.
[722.84 → 724.92] But, like, I've got $3 or $4 on this motherboard.
[725.58 → 726.94] And so, Intel might kick in some.
[727.04 → 729.52] The motherboard vendor might kick in some just to get these moving.
[729.76 → 733.16] I've got another $5 or $10 on the CPU.
[733.66 → 746.74] If I take $5 out of my margin because my handling costs for two items that I'm shipping out the door at once versus one item and one item are actually much less than double – or are about half.
[746.82 → 747.76] They're a little over half.
[747.76 → 754.66] So, if I kick in a couple dollars of my margin in my handling cost, okay, now we're working with something.
[754.88 → 757.44] Now we can do, okay, buy these together and get $20 off.
[757.44 → 761.44] Or buy these together and get, you know, a free game.
[761.44 → 762.76] Or whatever the case may be.
[762.76 → 766.86] So, you can get really creative with the way that you can leverage these discounts to push stuff out.
[766.96 → 770.50] And then, typically, you just don't discount the new stuff at all.
[770.50 → 782.94] So, naturally, for the, you know, let's face it, 5% to 8% performance improvement generation over generation that we've been dealing with over the last – I mean, not the last couple of years.
[783.16 → 784.60] Yay, AMD competition.
[784.60 → 790.96] But before that, you end up with, naturally, about a 5% to 10% difference in price.
[791.30 → 793.04] Or maybe even a little bit more.
[793.22 → 802.36] But then, typically, the new platform comes with some new features like, you know, more high-speed USB ports, more SATA ports, or whatever it is that the kids care about for this particular generation.
[802.88 → 806.54] So, Intel doesn't normally slash prices on older products like that.
[806.76 → 806.94] Not like this.
[806.94 → 810.34] So, are they only doing it now because the goalposts are moving so fast?
[810.48 → 811.30] Absolutely, I think.
[811.30 → 817.42] So, they're doing it because AMD is forcing them to completely rethink their pricing for 10th gen.
[818.00 → 820.82] And then, feel free to join us whenever you want, Luke.
[822.22 → 829.90] So, they're completely rethinking their pricing stack for 10th gen because that just ain't going to fly with AMD putting pressure on them the way that they are.
[829.90 → 840.52] And now, well, that traditional strategy of having these priced, you know, 5% or 10% lower than the new one, well, that ain't going to work with $10 discounts.
[841.30 → 843.74] So, you're going to have to go at it quite a bit harder.
[844.44 → 846.70] So, yeah, their hand has absolutely been forced.
[846.90 → 849.44] And I, for one, welcome our new AMD overlords.
[849.44 → 856.08] Do you think that the rumours that this is going to affect more than just this, just Skylike, do you think that's pretty credible?
[856.94 → 858.32] They're going to slash prices on a lot?
[859.24 → 860.52] I don't know.
[860.62 → 867.68] The thing is, on the, on the mainstream platform, shoot, I forget, I forget what are we on, like Coffee Lake Refresh at this point?
[867.68 → 870.68] I can't remember what kind of lake we're on right now.
[870.78 → 871.32] I'm sorry.
[871.42 → 871.86] Pardon me.
[872.28 → 880.92] But their, their 9th gen desktop consumer platform chips, they're not as far out to lunch compared to AMD's offerings.
[881.74 → 882.14] Oh, wow.
[882.38 → 882.68] Okay.
[882.90 → 884.66] I wanted to just see you later.
[885.78 → 887.64] Then I smashed the light.
[887.78 → 889.82] Very, very awkward.
[890.12 → 890.20] Yeah.
[890.52 → 891.70] Wait, no, put it back.
[891.70 → 894.52] And the chair's like plugged into the wall because it's RGB.
[895.50 → 897.60] Absolutely brilliant, ladies and gentlemen.
[897.86 → 899.62] That, James Tribe, everyone.
[900.52 → 901.40] Stop, don't twist.
[901.42 → 902.16] Yeah, buddy.
[902.84 → 905.22] I noticed you were missing your product placement.
[905.62 → 906.24] Was I?
[906.36 → 907.14] What is this for?
[907.36 → 908.58] It's, it's your product placement.
[908.66 → 909.44] My product placement?
[909.72 → 909.92] Yeah.
[910.28 → 910.76] There you go.
[911.16 → 912.60] What is, what is this?
[913.16 → 914.56] Do you have any context for this?
[914.56 → 916.24] Is that not a topic this week?
[916.38 → 917.52] Did that not make it in the dock?
[917.64 → 919.14] RTX 2070 Super?
[919.36 → 920.30] Did you not hear about that?
[920.30 → 922.04] Oh, we're going to have to talk about it.
[922.18 → 924.38] There's an additional topic today, guys.
[924.62 → 924.94] Okay.
[924.98 → 926.34] Why don't we jump right into it?
[926.36 → 926.60] Yeah.
[926.70 → 927.98] I am so sorry.
[928.08 → 930.40] I have not heard about this.
[930.42 → 931.96] You've been a little bit under a rock today.
[932.68 → 933.40] Is this today?
[933.60 → 933.96] I mean.
[934.28 → 935.16] Was it yesterday?
[935.34 → 935.54] Yeah.
[935.54 → 935.70] Today?
[935.70 → 936.52] It's kind of like.
[937.44 → 937.76] All right.
[937.78 → 938.74] It's a big nothingburger.
[938.86 → 939.18] All right.
[939.24 → 939.54] All right.
[939.62 → 939.84] All right.
[939.84 → 941.26] Yeah, we talk about this kind of stuff.
[941.26 → 943.32] I thought the big news from this week.
[943.32 → 943.86] This is a thing we do.
[943.90 → 944.54] Hold on a second.
[945.04 → 946.70] Speaking of ways to make money.
[946.70 → 952.60] I thought the big news this week was that the Swacked is back in stock.
[952.70 → 953.36] Oh, dang.
[953.82 → 954.68] Oh, dang.
[954.76 → 955.34] Oh, dang.
[955.84 → 956.40] Oh, dang.
[956.50 → 957.42] Did you get one of these?
[957.72 → 957.98] No.
[958.16 → 958.50] A Swacked?
[958.54 → 959.64] Is it way at the bottom?
[960.32 → 961.08] Yes, I did.
[961.54 → 962.58] I take that back.
[962.68 → 963.42] Is it wet at the bottom?
[963.68 → 964.22] Oh, it is.
[964.24 → 965.66] It's way at the bottom of the page, too.
[965.84 → 966.32] No, it's not.
[966.44 → 967.26] Oh, well, it is on here.
[967.34 → 968.24] Oh, I might not have refreshed it.
[968.24 → 969.00] Yeah, you need to refresh it.
[969.00 → 970.34] The Swacked is back.
[970.96 → 971.74] It's a sweater.
[971.92 → 972.72] It's a jacket.
[973.24 → 976.32] It is perfect for fall, and it has orange accents.
[976.86 → 977.76] It's the opposite.
[978.28 → 981.22] It is kind of getting to the temperature where I should probably pull it back out.
[981.44 → 985.14] I actually wear it every morning when I drop the kids off at school and stuff, because
[985.14 → 986.66] it's like perfect.
[986.88 → 989.22] When I first got it, it was still a little summary.
[989.64 → 991.28] So it was like a little too warm.
[991.28 → 992.16] Not great summer wear.
[992.30 → 992.50] Yeah.
[992.58 → 993.34] It's not great summer wear.
[993.34 → 995.26] But now it's kind of getting to the yeah.
[995.62 → 995.76] Yeah.
[995.76 → 998.72] It's kind of the opposite of the stealth hoodie.
[998.86 → 1001.12] It's pretty, it's pretty flashy.
[1001.42 → 1004.08] It's got reflective stripes on the front and the back.
[1004.52 → 1005.80] It's got orange accents.
[1005.80 → 1006.58] But it's not obnoxious.
[1006.70 → 1007.68] I don't think it's super obnoxious.
[1007.68 → 1009.10] It's flashy, but it's not obnoxious.
[1009.26 → 1011.54] It's an important, you know, important distinction.
[1011.54 → 1011.82] All right.
[1011.88 → 1015.12] So that was an obnoxious interruption there for me pimping the merch.
[1015.24 → 1017.24] Why don't you go ahead and move us on to our next topic here?
[1017.24 → 1018.96] And also, all the t-shirts are back.
[1018.98 → 1019.36] Oh, yeah.
[1019.48 → 1021.30] A bunch of sizes of t-shirts are back in stock.
[1021.38 → 1023.62] I think everything but Constellation, is that right?
[1023.64 → 1023.94] Tech Linked.
[1024.06 → 1024.72] And Tech Linked.
[1024.72 → 1026.88] Speaking of Constellation, okay.
[1027.36 → 1028.16] You're going to love this.
[1028.22 → 1029.68] Is Constellation still your favourite design?
[1030.72 → 1031.58] Of the shirts?
[1031.70 → 1031.88] Yeah.
[1032.84 → 1033.90] It's definitely up there.
[1034.16 → 1034.42] Okay.
[1034.92 → 1035.22] Yeah.
[1036.06 → 1037.32] We are experimenting.
[1038.06 → 1038.62] Hold on.
[1038.70 → 1040.48] No, I need your full and undivided attention for this.
[1040.48 → 1040.76] Okay.
[1040.76 → 1040.98] Okay.
[1041.24 → 1041.42] Okay.
[1041.76 → 1046.46] We are experimenting with glow-in-the-dark ink for Constellation.
[1047.14 → 1051.00] So the Constellations would actually glow-in-the-dark.
[1051.00 → 1052.74] But like the mountain range?
[1052.78 → 1053.76] Because there's a mountain range, right?
[1053.76 → 1055.44] I don't think we'd have the mountain glow.
[1055.62 → 1055.82] Yeah.
[1055.90 → 1056.76] So that would say.
[1057.20 → 1057.56] Yeah.
[1057.64 → 1058.26] Just the stars.
[1058.38 → 1059.62] That's pretty sick, actually.
[1059.80 → 1060.04] Okay.
[1060.10 → 1061.46] We have no idea.
[1061.72 → 1064.14] So our printer actually did a test one for me.
[1064.20 → 1065.76] And I'm supposed to wear it and wash it.
[1066.10 → 1067.54] And make sure that it holds up okay.
[1067.54 → 1070.76] Because we have no idea if the ink is decent quality.
[1070.76 → 1074.42] So guys, this is not a guarantee at all.
[1074.62 → 1079.62] And in fact, if you wanted a glow-in-the-dark Constellation shirt, honestly, it would probably
[1079.62 → 1084.70] be more time effective to just order a Constellation shirt and then get a glow-in-the-dark
[1084.70 → 1084.98] thing.
[1085.62 → 1086.96] There's not that many stars.
[1086.96 → 1092.24] But it's something that I just saw as an idea.
[1092.52 → 1094.62] And I was like, holy crap, that would be amazing.
[1095.10 → 1096.70] So our printer is experimenting with it.
[1096.72 → 1097.60] And we're going to try and do it.
[1098.24 → 1099.56] Pimpin' the Elemental.
[1099.64 → 1099.78] Yeah.
[1099.86 → 1101.14] That design is dead.
[1102.20 → 1102.72] All right.
[1102.72 → 1103.40] There's smalls left.
[1104.56 → 1105.50] There are smalls still?
[1105.68 → 1106.46] There you go.
[1106.90 → 1111.20] So tell me about whatever is going on here.
[1111.20 → 1118.34] There was a Reddit thread posted by a random new account with one post talking about how
[1118.34 → 1122.72] YouTubers are getting paid by companies for things that they're not disclosing.
[1122.82 → 1123.84] This happens everyone's in Bloomer.
[1124.10 → 1129.54] The main thing they were pointing at was boxes in the background being a paid product placement
[1129.54 → 1130.00] spot.
[1131.38 → 1132.88] I'm actually kind of surprised.
[1133.56 → 1136.00] I don't think LTT came...
[1136.00 → 1136.26] No.
[1136.38 → 1137.86] That has no traction whatsoever.
[1138.02 → 1138.22] No.
[1138.22 → 1143.52] So I have the tech power-up article, which is where this kind of got a little gnarly.
[1143.98 → 1148.16] But I'm surprised Linus Actives didn't come up because of the old WAN show set.
[1149.16 → 1150.56] What did we have on the old WAN?
[1150.62 → 1151.04] I thought...
[1151.04 → 1151.98] Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[1151.98 → 1153.66] The whole set was just products.
[1154.16 → 1155.36] The whole thing.
[1155.66 → 1155.88] Okay.
[1155.88 → 1157.46] I love how we dodged this completely.
[1157.66 → 1160.24] That was so unprofessionally done.
[1161.24 → 1162.56] No one's going to...
[1162.56 → 1164.58] No one would believe we got paid to do that.
[1164.58 → 1168.92] It just like slowly fell over a year and just no one fixed it.
[1169.16 → 1169.58] Well, no.
[1169.92 → 1171.98] That was because they weren't paying their bills on time.
[1172.88 → 1173.44] So...
[1173.44 → 1175.62] And they slowly got ended from the pile.
[1175.68 → 1179.70] When someone at the bottom of the pile didn't pay the bill, well, everyone on top just fell.
[1179.84 → 1180.06] Yeah.
[1180.24 → 1181.82] So we were trying to make them pressure each other.
[1181.82 → 1182.24] That's right.
[1182.34 → 1184.26] We were trying to make sure that they were keeping...
[1184.26 → 1185.78] holding each other accountable.
[1185.96 → 1186.20] Yeah.
[1186.48 → 1189.18] Accountable to pay us our money for WAN show.
[1191.90 → 1194.18] No, we'll do that later.
[1194.48 → 1194.70] Yeah.
[1194.96 → 1195.26] Yeah.
[1195.44 → 1199.42] So I actually don't know how Tweak down presented this.
[1199.46 → 1201.40] And they might have presented this just fine.
[1201.44 → 1201.66] Okay.
[1201.72 → 1202.04] Well, sure.
[1202.12 → 1202.56] What the hay.
[1202.56 → 1204.46] Let's view some ads.
[1204.64 → 1208.34] And also, maybe there will be an article by going on Tweakdown.com.
[1208.36 → 1211.58] This is not as bad as some review sites that we have visited.
[1211.58 → 1214.44] NVIDIA and YouTube shenanigans.
[1214.76 → 1215.30] Shenaniganigans.
[1215.96 → 1216.28] Wow.
[1216.68 → 1217.08] Henan...
[1217.08 → 1218.64] That adds pretty neat.
[1218.64 → 1219.16] That adds pretty neat.
[1219.26 → 1223.50] The mods at slash NVIDIA and slash AMD refuse to let this be discussed openly.
[1224.02 → 1226.32] I'm not sure why exactly as no reason was giving.
[1226.42 → 1228.68] I hope we can foster a fair conversation here.
[1228.90 → 1229.54] Thank you.
[1229.64 → 1229.86] Because it's BS.
[1229.86 → 1230.10] Hopefully.
[1231.04 → 1234.24] I registered a new Reddit account today so I could post this with anonymity.
[1234.24 → 1240.72] I am scared that NVIDIA will punish me if I talked about this under my YouTube channel.
[1240.72 → 1242.44] What are you talking about?
[1242.52 → 1243.66] Oh, hey, I did get mentioned.
[1244.68 → 1245.84] Not LTT big.
[1246.42 → 1247.44] My channel is pretty big.
[1247.50 → 1249.20] I think this is something the community needs to know.
[1249.26 → 1251.48] I'm a YouTuber that makes video reviews on computer hardware.
[1252.12 → 1253.50] Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[1253.70 → 1254.18] And I work...
[1254.18 → 1254.32] Okay.
[1254.38 → 1257.62] NVIDIA has been pushing us YouTubers for NVIDIA products to have a presence.
[1257.62 → 1261.40] So you could find someone who works with AS Rock because there's not that many people that do it.
[1261.76 → 1262.96] And perhaps I forgot who this is.
[1262.96 → 1266.04] I did a video a couple of weeks ago with AS Rock stuff in it.
[1266.10 → 1266.42] Oh, wow.
[1266.42 → 1266.86] Yeah.
[1267.12 → 1269.46] They have an AMD board.
[1269.48 → 1270.54] How long was the time before that?
[1273.84 → 1275.48] Or am I just totally off my rocker?
[1275.78 → 1276.24] I could be.
[1276.24 → 1276.92] I've been out of it.
[1277.04 → 1284.18] AS Rock Rack, which AS Rock Rack actually gets upset when you call them AS Rock, even though they're just the server division of AS Rock.
[1284.62 → 1284.94] Okay.
[1285.16 → 1285.38] Okay.
[1285.42 → 1291.78] Anyway, AS Rock Rack we work with from time to time because they do really cool IT server boards with big sockets.
[1291.78 → 1294.42] I just very rarely see videos on AS Rock.
[1294.42 → 1294.86] No, big sockets, you know?
[1295.82 → 1296.70] Thick sockets.
[1296.74 → 1297.32] Thick sockets.
[1298.52 → 1298.96] Okay.
[1299.18 → 1299.76] So back to this.
[1299.76 → 1300.60] Robust sockets.
[1300.78 → 1307.06] NVIDIA has been pushing us YouTubers for NVIDIA products to have a presence in AMD and Intel review videos that we put up.
[1307.28 → 1309.78] I have verified this is happening with a lot of channels.
[1310.00 → 1314.30] Nobody wants to talk about it publicly because they're afraid of NVIDIA cutting them off from hardware and drivers.
[1314.76 → 1315.20] Oh, no.
[1315.20 → 1317.84] They're afraid they will lose NVIDIA sponsorship and advertising money.
[1318.42 → 1321.28] Yes, NVIDIA pays a lot of YouTube channels for exposure.
[1321.72 → 1328.70] This started when the first Vega 7 cards were coming out and now NVIDIA, particularly NVPR, names removed.
[1329.24 → 1334.78] Both press relations from employees are pushing this very hard since RX 5700 cards were released.
[1335.84 → 1339.96] When I started, I really wanted YouTubers to rehash, to distract, wait, what?
[1340.60 → 1344.52] NVIDIA pushed comparing AMD with AMD and keeping their cards out of the mix for benchmarks?
[1345.20 → 1347.38] NVIDIA is also asking YouTubers to do other things.
[1347.54 → 1352.30] NVIDIA asked me and others to make sure we always had NVIDIA branding visible in AMD and Intel coverage videos.
[1353.94 → 1356.48] What are you even talking about?
[1356.76 → 1357.92] Yeah, so this is awesome.
[1358.52 → 1365.10] And then I think, I don't know how much traction this got, but it's some crazy dude on Reddit, so whatever.
[1367.24 → 1371.10] What got interesting is that, I don't know what Tweak town wrote about it.
[1371.20 → 1372.24] Sorry, I didn't read it.
[1373.10 → 1374.94] But Tech Power Up picked it up.
[1375.68 → 1375.92] Yeah.
[1376.12 → 1384.54] Tech Power Up wrote an entire article going, not like, oh hey, because I saw on the Tweak town thing, it was like, ah, conspiracy, whatever.
[1384.88 → 1385.08] Yeah.
[1385.16 → 1388.80] And he's just reporting on a Reddit thread that maybe blew up a little bit and that's fine.
[1389.84 → 1391.98] Tech Power Up was like, this happened.
[1392.34 → 1393.80] NVIDIA is paying people.
[1394.46 → 1395.12] Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[1395.12 → 1396.32] Here's an example.
[1396.68 → 1398.14] And they put, it's been changed now.
[1398.22 → 1400.74] Now it's just the YouTube not happy face.
[1400.90 → 1402.68] Here, let me see if I can share your screen.
[1402.80 → 1403.04] There you go.
[1403.04 → 1410.26] But it used to be a picture of Steve from Gamers Nexus standing on a set with hardware in the background.
[1410.26 → 1412.64] And they're like, here is an example of it happening.
[1413.24 → 1415.10] Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.
[1415.10 → 1416.42] Oh, ho, ho, ho.
[1416.42 → 1424.68] I can tell you for a fact that Steve would disclose any sponsorship.
[1424.68 → 1428.08] Okay, so you know what?
[1429.08 → 1430.60] I'm going to help you all out, okay?
[1431.02 → 1436.82] So you want to talk about tech reviewers that cover this kind of stuff, right?
[1438.40 → 1440.60] What the deuce is?
[1441.04 → 1443.66] Oh, hold on a second.
[1443.78 → 1444.08] Okay.
[1444.62 → 1446.20] I think this is the right number.
[1448.82 → 1450.28] There's more to this story, but I'm trying to get it.
[1450.28 → 1451.34] One moment, please.
[1451.34 → 1455.34] I just have to take, I have to place a quick phone call if you'll excuse me, please.
[1457.44 → 1459.34] I said, excuse me.
[1460.30 → 1462.08] Just don't show the number.
[1462.56 → 1463.84] I'm not going to show the number.
[1464.94 → 1465.68] I'm not an idiot.
[1465.94 → 1470.42] I mean, the amount of things that get leaked on the show.
[1470.42 → 1471.94] That time when we leaked our payroll.
[1475.66 → 1476.46] Oh, God.
[1476.60 → 1476.82] Okay.
[1477.92 → 1478.32] Okay.
[1478.32 → 1478.74] Oh.
[1480.16 → 1481.20] Conspiracy confirmed.
[1481.80 → 1483.46] Paul is not picking up.
[1485.14 → 1487.02] He doesn't want to talk about it.
[1487.16 → 1487.40] All right.
[1487.44 → 1487.74] Well, no.
[1487.80 → 1489.06] Maybe he's just not around right now.
[1489.10 → 1489.34] It's fine.
[1489.40 → 1490.46] I'll try someone else.
[1490.50 → 1491.20] I'll try someone else.
[1491.34 → 1491.80] It's a nice try.
[1491.98 → 1492.26] Okay.
[1492.46 → 1493.02] All right.
[1493.88 → 1495.74] You should just, what if you just call Steve?
[1496.80 → 1497.48] No, no.
[1497.48 → 1498.16] Because he has a video up on it.
[1498.16 → 1498.52] Yeah, yeah.
[1498.64 → 1499.62] I'll try Steve.
[1499.68 → 1500.16] I'll try Steve.
[1500.16 → 1500.44] Okay.
[1501.40 → 1503.68] Just, it says stay on the line while your call is being completed.
[1503.84 → 1504.86] I'm trying, I'm trying Jay.
[1504.96 → 1505.30] I'm trying Jay.
[1505.30 → 1507.12] While you're calling, if you want, just throw my screen up.
[1507.32 → 1507.76] Yeah, for sure.
[1507.84 → 1508.08] For sure.
[1508.14 → 1508.44] Go ahead.
[1508.44 → 1509.10] And, yeah.
[1509.18 → 1510.70] So, Steve addressed this on his Twitter.
[1510.82 → 1513.70] I also like that our own Anthony Young.
[1513.70 → 1513.88] Wait.
[1515.66 → 1517.20] Jay is not picking up either.
[1517.86 → 1518.96] They've all fled town.
[1519.48 → 1520.90] They're leaving the country.
[1520.90 → 1522.48] Wow.
[1523.40 → 1523.74] Okay.
[1523.86 → 1524.82] Let's try Kyle.
[1525.22 → 1525.62] Okay.
[1526.56 → 1527.32] Actually, you know what?
[1527.38 → 1527.54] No.
[1527.64 → 1528.20] Screw that guy.
[1528.28 → 1528.96] Let's try Lyle.
[1532.90 → 1533.44] Go ahead.
[1533.52 → 1533.64] Sorry.
[1533.64 → 1535.58] So, you can see on his Twitter.
[1535.70 → 1536.94] He's addressing it directly.
[1538.78 → 1542.94] I demanded immediate removal of his likeness from the content and a statement apologizing,
[1543.34 → 1545.88] which is, like, more than fair.
[1547.16 → 1553.56] He also followed up saying that they did just that, which I thought was also more than fair.
[1553.56 → 1560.66] And then they posted their own video, which was hilarious and kind of fun to watch, that is here.
[1560.86 → 1561.28] And I recommend you check it out.
[1561.28 → 1561.58] Lyle!
[1561.76 → 1563.20] Even Lyle isn't picking up!
[1563.24 → 1564.74] And I thought he had integrity!
[1565.02 → 1569.14] Maybe Lyle is trapped somewhere.
[1569.68 → 1571.90] Maybe my bat phone is just not working.
[1572.02 → 1573.32] I can't get in touch with anybody.
[1573.70 → 1574.02] I can't.
[1574.10 → 1575.30] I don't want to show this.
[1575.30 → 1577.40] Maybe no one wants to talk to me, says Ed.
[1577.42 → 1578.30] I'm going to play this and then go all the time.
[1578.30 → 1579.42] Well, then why are you standing there?
[1579.44 → 1580.68] You seem like you want to talk to me.
[1580.82 → 1581.38] I have to.
[1583.32 → 1583.82] What's up?
[1583.98 → 1584.88] Can you look at your team?
[1584.94 → 1585.72] Oh, look at my team.
[1585.80 → 1586.10] Oh, wait.
[1586.20 → 1586.66] Oh, hold on.
[1586.74 → 1587.50] Kyle's calling back.
[1587.56 → 1588.10] No, I'm sorry.
[1588.16 → 1589.20] I can't look at my teams right now.
[1590.12 → 1590.44] Sir!
[1590.98 → 1591.26] Go.
[1591.72 → 1592.02] Yeah.
[1592.22 → 1597.38] So, I think you really owe the community an explanation, sir.
[1598.94 → 1599.26] Okay.
[1599.48 → 1600.52] Are you live-streaming right now?
[1600.62 → 1602.86] Also, sorry.
[1602.98 → 1604.06] I seem to have mistitled.
[1604.06 → 1605.54] I have really wanted to talk to Lyle.
[1607.34 → 1609.34] Oh, well, he's not here right now.
[1609.40 → 1609.68] Okay.
[1609.76 → 1610.26] No problem.
[1610.48 → 1611.12] No problem.
[1611.18 → 1612.02] I'll settle for Kyle.
[1612.20 → 1617.42] So, how much money is NVIDIA paying you for the product placement of their boxes in the
[1617.42 → 1618.48] back of your videos, sir?
[1621.52 → 1622.34] Jesus Christ.
[1622.42 → 1623.48] Are you working for AMD again?
[1624.72 → 1625.12] Wait.
[1625.22 → 1625.72] Hold on a second.
[1625.82 → 1627.04] Have you not heard about this either?
[1629.24 → 1629.64] No.
[1629.88 → 1630.42] I haven't.
[1630.48 → 1631.06] Oh, excellent.
[1631.28 → 1632.32] Fill me in, please.
[1632.74 → 1633.44] Oh, excellent.
[1633.44 → 1633.76] Okay.
[1633.76 → 1635.52] So, here you go, guys.
[1635.72 → 1637.12] Giant conspiracy theory.
[1637.98 → 1645.46] Tech YouTubers are getting paid by NVIDIA to put NVIDIA branding randomly in the backs
[1645.46 → 1648.72] of their videos, but they don't know about it.
[1650.60 → 1651.04] Wait.
[1651.44 → 1651.72] Wait.
[1651.86 → 1654.26] Can you tell me more, and where do I sign up?
[1655.54 → 1656.52] That sounds awesome.
[1656.66 → 1657.52] I'm super on board.
[1657.60 → 1659.22] It's about time they start an initiative like that.
[1659.34 → 1660.34] I'm waiting for this shit.
[1660.34 → 1661.34] Super easy.
[1661.68 → 1664.16] Just put a box in the back and just automatically make money.
[1664.40 → 1665.40] I know, right?
[1666.20 → 1666.88] Thanks, Kyle.
[1667.02 → 1672.12] I had just wanted to confirm that you were also not getting checks, and so I don't have
[1672.12 → 1676.74] to feel bad about not getting my checks in the mail for having my NVIDIA box here on the
[1676.74 → 1677.46] WAN show today.
[1677.90 → 1679.12] I really appreciate it.
[1680.00 → 1683.78] Oh, since I've got you on the line, should we tease that upcoming collab?
[1685.46 → 1686.48] Yeah, that'd be awesome.
[1686.48 → 1687.52] Oh, hold on.
[1687.56 → 1688.98] Here, let me switch back to the thing.
[1689.26 → 1691.24] So we're actually doing something with Kyle.
[1691.40 → 1693.42] This is the first you're hearing about it, I think, Luke.
[1693.74 → 1697.06] So I saw a picture that led me to believe something might be going on, but that's about
[1697.06 → 1697.16] it.
[1697.40 → 1703.92] So it's not actually going to be me or Kyle that are featured prominently in the video,
[1704.12 → 1710.82] even though it's a collab between Linus Tech Tips and Nitwit, which is what he calls
[1710.82 → 1711.88] his channel for whatever reason.
[1712.44 → 1720.62] So instead, it's going to be a build-off between Wifey Sauce and my wife.
[1720.74 → 1721.50] Oh, man.
[1721.56 → 1727.14] Except I think we had talked about it, and the stipulation was the only resources they
[1727.14 → 1731.02] can each use for how to build a PC are their own husband's videos.
[1731.70 → 1732.14] Videos?
[1733.76 → 1736.86] Do you even have a how to build a PC guide?
[1736.86 → 1742.12] Maybe not a real new one.
[1743.20 → 1745.30] I could rectify that in the next month.
[1747.50 → 1748.16] Oh, wow.
[1748.24 → 1750.94] So we can make updated versions from now until the shoot.
[1751.12 → 1752.48] Oh, you guys haven't shot it yet.
[1752.62 → 1756.34] Well, I mean, we can't just, we can't, I mean, you can't have a stipulation that we
[1756.34 → 1757.96] can't create video content.
[1758.12 → 1758.46] I mean, we...
[1758.46 → 1760.62] You should make a video called To Yvonne.
[1762.02 → 1765.28] And just have it be, like, the guide for her.
[1765.38 → 1766.76] I bet you would actually do really well.
[1767.10 → 1767.54] Probably.
[1768.44 → 1771.38] How to build this PC, step by step.
[1771.40 → 1774.56] Do a live stream of me building a PC in front of Wifey Sauce?
[1776.90 → 1778.50] Okay, that's definitely cheating.
[1780.22 → 1780.78] All right.
[1780.92 → 1782.12] Anyway, so there you go, guys.
[1782.34 → 1783.42] You heard it here first.
[1783.50 → 1783.98] Thanks, Kyle.
[1784.06 → 1784.56] Talk to you later.
[1785.02 → 1785.42] All right.
[1785.62 → 1786.00] See you guys.
[1786.14 → 1786.42] Bye.
[1786.42 → 1786.48] Bye.
[1786.98 → 1787.12] Bye.
[1787.12 → 1788.68] All right.
[1788.92 → 1790.28] So confirmed.
[1790.46 → 1793.08] Kyle is also not getting paid.
[1794.04 → 1794.62] Oh, wait.
[1794.62 → 1796.78] I thought he was just calling everyone.
[1799.04 → 1800.38] He's answering his team thing now.
[1800.58 → 1800.70] Yeah.
[1800.70 → 1806.56] So yeah, I would watch, go watch Gamers Nexus' video because he's great, they're great,
[1806.64 → 1809.10] and that is like a positive interaction for this.
[1809.40 → 1811.22] Do not go to Tech Power Up's article.
[1812.26 → 1813.30] Don't do that.
[1813.30 → 1820.26] Just watch the coverage of it done by YouTubers because that's the real kick in the manners.
[1822.04 → 1822.48] Hey.
[1822.48 → 1825.04] How could you have been so dishonest with me, Mr. Burke?
[1826.04 → 1826.38] Guys.
[1826.46 → 1826.98] I don't know which part.
[1827.16 → 1834.60] Guys, this is Steven Burke from Gamers Nexus here, and you told me.
[1834.72 → 1835.08] Wait.
[1835.08 → 1836.38] Hey, I have a special guest, too.
[1836.46 → 1836.66] Wait.
[1837.54 → 1837.86] Steve.
[1837.86 → 1838.50] Say hi.
[1838.98 → 1839.26] Hello.
[1839.72 → 1841.14] Let's do some server stuff.
[1841.26 → 1841.90] Hi, Wendell.
[1841.94 → 1843.16] Hey, Wendell.
[1845.20 → 1846.30] Oh, sick, dude.
[1847.16 → 1847.54] Okay.
[1847.88 → 1848.82] So both of you.
[1848.88 → 1849.48] Single, single.
[1849.92 → 1854.32] Look, both of you, since I have you on the line, how can you have been so dishonest with
[1854.32 → 1854.52] me?
[1854.52 → 1859.86] I thought you told me that we were going to be just, if we got caught, we were going to
[1859.86 → 1862.42] admit the NVIDIA sponsorship scandal.
[1863.10 → 1867.28] And here you are, Steve, doubling down on that they're not paying you.
[1867.38 → 1870.04] Why can't you just be honest with yourself and the community?
[1870.96 → 1874.94] Well, I was kind of hoping you would admit it first, and then we would just run you over
[1874.94 → 1875.56] with the buzz.
[1878.22 → 1879.54] That was my plan.
[1879.54 → 1884.76] Yeah, but now you've gone, and you've raised the profile of this issue.
[1885.10 → 1889.70] You know, now you're putting me in a very difficult position here.
[1890.10 → 1891.52] Don't draw Luke into this.
[1891.66 → 1893.00] He works for Float plane now.
[1893.26 → 1893.88] He has nothing.
[1895.12 → 1897.04] Don't let this sully his good name.
[1899.46 → 1900.94] But I hear Luke's laugh.
[1900.94 → 1903.94] I don't mean to your employees, Linus.
[1904.24 → 1905.42] I don't know how you let them speak.
[1906.02 → 1907.80] It's all about Linus all the time.
[1907.80 → 1912.26] I even made sure that we had our NVIDIA product placement for the show today.
[1913.94 → 1916.26] And now I'm the one getting in trouble.
[1917.54 → 1918.24] Oh, boy.
[1918.46 → 1924.28] I can't see what sort of Lovecraft horror that you've done, but I'm sure it's amazing.
[1926.64 → 1927.36] All right.
[1927.48 → 1928.94] So, you know what?
[1929.62 → 1932.48] I think there is something good that can come out of all of this, though.
[1932.48 → 1948.64] And that's that, look, if NVIDIA is going to take a bunch of PR flack, and we're going to take a bunch of flack from the community over these sponsorship dollars, then, hey, at least we can use it as leverage to get them to finally actually spend some money with YouTubers.
[1948.64 → 1950.86] And throw some sponsors.
[1950.86 → 1951.26] Yeah.
[1953.20 → 1958.10] I like how some of the people that are complaining about this also have boxes in the background.
[1958.76 → 1960.94] Do you think something can give you a check for that?
[1961.08 → 1962.50] Because I don't know how that works.
[1963.00 → 1963.96] Like, I got the boxes.
[1964.14 → 1964.78] Where's the check?
[1964.96 → 1967.04] It's almost like I need to read.
[1967.42 → 1968.28] Let's save it.
[1968.38 → 1971.76] No, you put the boxes in the background first, and then you bill them later.
[1972.10 → 1973.08] That's not how it works.
[1973.08 → 1975.52] All right.
[1975.58 → 1975.80] Thanks.
[1975.86 → 1978.84] I was just, I felt like we owed it to our WAN Show audience.
[1979.16 → 1982.98] We've been being quite tongue-in-cheek throughout this segment.
[1983.98 → 2001.40] But I felt like we owed it to our WAN Show audience to utilize our YouTuber, tech YouTuber connections, to demonstrate that whoever this article is talking about, and I have no idea who it could possibly be, but supposedly it's big tech.
[2001.40 → 2002.18] I don't think it's a real person.
[2002.18 → 2007.02] I have conspiracy theories as well, but I don't think it's a YouTuber.
[2007.86 → 2026.90] Oh, there's no way it's a YouTuber, because supposedly they know other tech YouTubers, and I don't think I'm connected directly with everyone, but my cell phone book is pretty full of tech YouTubers, and I'm pretty damn sure that all of them have as much trouble extracting money from NVIDIA for sponsorship as I do.
[2027.46 → 2027.90] So.
[2027.90 → 2039.72] Yeah, and Linus, on a separate note, we just got finished placing you in a featured video with Wendell.
[2040.18 → 2041.58] We didn't require you here.
[2041.66 → 2043.26] We used AI to recreate you.
[2043.46 → 2043.98] Really?
[2045.74 → 2047.10] Yeah, it's really advanced.
[2047.10 → 2048.40] Did you guys deepfake me?
[2050.44 → 2051.66] It's not quite that good.
[2053.06 → 2057.76] Is it a bad Photoshop job of, like, one of our thumbnails?
[2059.06 → 2060.94] It's not a bad Photoshop job.
[2062.32 → 2063.94] It is a Photoshop job.
[2063.94 → 2068.62] But we got some LTT merch in there for you, so you'll have the product placement there.
[2068.88 → 2070.16] So does that mean you get checks from that?
[2070.16 → 2071.62] Yeah, when do I get the check?
[2071.72 → 2072.46] When do you get the check?
[2072.60 → 2072.96] Yeah.
[2073.08 → 2074.16] It's your hoodie.
[2074.16 → 2078.06] I'll send you the check for the hoodie when you send me the check for the mod mats, all right?
[2078.16 → 2078.36] Deal?
[2079.44 → 2080.24] No, you know what?
[2080.28 → 2080.80] Never mind.
[2080.90 → 2085.82] And given how much bigger my channel is, I think you owe me a much bigger check.
[2088.12 → 2089.18] Yeah, you know what?
[2089.18 → 2090.08] You're breaking offline.
[2091.48 → 2091.92] Sorry.
[2092.10 → 2092.40] Sorry.
[2092.48 → 2093.10] What's that, Steve?
[2093.22 → 2093.46] Okay.
[2093.56 → 2093.78] Sorry.
[2093.90 → 2094.08] Yeah.
[2094.20 → 2094.38] Okay.
[2094.40 → 2094.58] Okay.
[2094.58 → 2094.82] Bye.
[2094.94 → 2095.18] Bye.
[2095.24 → 2095.66] Bye, guys.
[2096.44 → 2096.80] Bye.
[2096.80 → 2096.92] Bye.
[2096.92 → 2097.16] Bye.
[2099.02 → 2100.30] So, yeah, that's a thing.
[2100.58 → 2102.86] Go watch Gamers Nexus's video on it.
[2102.86 → 2102.96] Yeah.
[2102.96 → 2106.52] And go watch Wendell's videos that are completely unrelated because he's great.
[2106.60 → 2106.82] Yeah.
[2107.32 → 2113.10] So, just to be very clear, we actually have worked with NVIDIA a handful of times in the last couple of years.
[2113.22 → 2114.58] You guys also worked with them recently.
[2114.80 → 2115.00] Yeah.
[2115.08 → 2119.76] So, we did a video with them, I think, about a year, a year and a half ago.
[2120.70 → 2121.76] Oh, holiday 20.
[2121.82 → 2123.68] It was either holiday 2017 or 2018.
[2123.68 → 2131.92] Talking about 4K gaming and how, bottom line is, NVIDIA's top tier card is the only way to game at 4K, which it was.
[2132.52 → 2136.04] We did something with them in the interim.
[2136.34 → 2137.28] Was there anything in between?
[2137.38 → 2137.94] Was that sponsored?
[2138.08 → 2138.44] Oh, yeah.
[2138.80 → 2139.48] Yes, it was.
[2139.82 → 2140.16] Are you sure?
[2140.30 → 2140.74] Yep, yep, yep.
[2140.92 → 2144.28] And then we did a G-Sync piece with them about six months ago.
[2144.42 → 2149.60] And then, more recently, we did the big thing that we talked about yesterday, the collab with Shroud,
[2149.60 → 2155.92] looking at high refresh rate versus low refresh rate gaming and how much of a difference it actually makes to your skills.
[2156.46 → 2160.76] So, that's the three projects that we've done with NVIDIA in, like, the last three or four years.
[2161.42 → 2166.82] We definitely don't get a check for Luke to have a silly box on the WAN show.
[2166.82 → 2170.38] And even during the launch of the what was it?
[2170.38 → 2176.38] Was it RTX Titan when we had the card, like, that we were able to flash on the show but then put away?
[2176.60 → 2178.24] Was that RTX Titan or something?
[2178.36 → 2178.50] Yeah.
[2178.90 → 2180.36] We didn't get paid for that.
[2180.60 → 2185.82] We just did it because we thought it was hilarious to, like, flash it with no other information.
[2185.82 → 2192.32] And then we actually didn't even end up doing a review of that card because we were so annoyed with the way that they handled the embargo.
[2192.58 → 2199.04] So, like, to imagine for a second that NVIDIA paid us money to, like, flash something for literally three seconds
[2199.04 → 2204.92] and then have an angry call with them afterwards about their bad embargo lift policy.
[2205.22 → 2207.50] Didn't you guys skip launch events for a bit?
[2208.34 → 2209.46] We still do.
[2209.50 → 2209.94] Still do.
[2210.10 → 2211.72] Yeah, we don't do their launch events anymore.
[2211.72 → 2212.70] Definitely getting paid, though.
[2212.70 → 2215.44] Yeah, definitely getting paid to not attend events.
[2215.44 → 2216.04] For sure.
[2217.58 → 2218.06] 100%.
[2218.06 → 2223.18] I mean, to be clear, like, there are people at NVIDIA that we have great working relationships with.
[2223.18 → 2223.34] Yeah.
[2223.46 → 2226.98] And there are people at NVIDIA that we don't have great working relationships with.
[2227.10 → 2227.96] I think what a lot of people.
[2227.96 → 2228.96] It was super fun.
[2229.12 → 2237.42] I think what a lot of people don't understand is that these companies actually work really hard to put up one face, you know, one brand.
[2237.42 → 2237.82] Yeah.
[2237.82 → 2244.98] But behind that is hundreds and, in some cases, thousands of people, all of whom have different agendas, different ideas, different ambitions.
[2245.44 → 2250.56] And different amounts of moral fibre in some cases.
[2250.56 → 2254.56] So just because something scummy happens doesn't necessarily mean that everyone was on board.
[2254.72 → 2258.52] And by the same token, just because something good happens doesn't mean that everyone was on board.
[2258.68 → 2258.78] Yeah.
[2258.78 → 2265.22] In this case, this is, I can say, beyond a shadow of a doubt, a complete nothingburger.
[2265.22 → 2266.70] Just scum and villainy.
[2266.82 → 2268.60] And we can all ignore it.
[2268.94 → 2270.22] Nick, what can I do for you, sir?
[2270.22 → 2276.64] Well, first, my question about that whole thing is, like, they're alleging that NVIDIA is paying reviewers or whatever.
[2277.60 → 2279.20] How does that work for NVIDIA?
[2279.68 → 2282.28] They don't just go light piles of money on fire.
[2283.10 → 2287.74] Well, the thing is, a lot of people think that NVIDIA spends a lot of money on marketing.
[2288.46 → 2293.66] Right, but I'm saying, even if they spent a lot of money on marketing, why would they pay people to show their boxes?
[2293.66 → 2304.16] A lot of people who don't really understand how marketing works think that, like, I mean, I...
[2304.16 → 2305.80] Product placement is, like, truth serum.
[2306.00 → 2309.74] And just, if it's there, like, 80% of the audience is going to buy it.
[2309.90 → 2312.56] Yeah, and, like, that wouldn't be effective.
[2312.70 → 2313.86] That would be a total waste of money.
[2313.86 → 2331.66] And the other thing, too, is that a lot of, like, a lot of people think that the way that money is flowing and changing hands is much more rapid and more fluid and less, you know, contract and lawyer-bound than it actually is.
[2331.66 → 2346.66] And so I'll see people coming out and saying, yeah, for sure, this video that LTT did is undisclosed sponsored video because, you know, I've seen a lot of shops in my day and I can tell by the pixels or whatever, like...
[2346.66 → 2372.24] When the reality of it is, like, that video is either only tangentially about the thing that they're alleging sponsored the video or includes a ton of information or, like, you know, a guide for how to use it improperly or whatever that no brand we've ever worked with would allow in a sponsored video.
[2372.36 → 2373.70] It just doesn't work that way.
[2373.70 → 2378.96] Honestly, I feel like I owe the community another Honest Answers video.
[2379.42 → 2380.04] Honest Answers.
[2380.04 → 2380.34] Things have changed.
[2380.52 → 2382.12] How do sponsored videos work?
[2382.36 → 2383.24] Oh, interesting, yeah.
[2383.54 → 2385.02] Like, really, how do they work?
[2385.08 → 2390.90] Like, maybe we could find a company that doesn't exist anymore so we could show the contract, for example.
[2391.02 → 2393.28] Like, if we found someone who doesn't exist, like...
[2393.28 → 2394.70] Nick's just like, uh...
[2395.24 → 2397.04] Like, Doppler Labs or something.
[2397.42 → 2398.98] You'd have to be careful if they were bought out.
[2398.98 → 2399.86] We can talk about that.
[2399.90 → 2400.46] They weren't bought.
[2400.54 → 2401.26] They're just dead.
[2401.26 → 2403.78] But, yeah, okay, we'll talk about it offline.
[2404.18 → 2409.20] But we could figure out just how much we can tell you guys and go as deep as we can into it.
[2409.36 → 2409.82] I'm so sorry.
[2410.22 → 2415.04] Because I think it's something that people don't understand, and they think they understand.
[2415.10 → 2424.30] I also think a Honest answer, like, follow-up or, like, re-up or something on how do we make money could be pretty cool.
[2424.30 → 2429.00] I thought about doing that, and I was actually looking at that the other day.
[2429.32 → 2435.66] And what I realized is that while the mix, like, the percentages have shifted around a little bit...
[2435.66 → 2437.04] Isn't it a lot of, like, new...
[2437.04 → 2442.64] There are new ways that we make money, but it's kind of muddy to calculate right now.
[2442.74 → 2445.64] So the merch side of the business does make money now.
[2445.64 → 2449.66] But, like, the way that you calculate that is really complicated.
[2449.96 → 2453.58] You can't just say, okay, well, however much you brought in...
[2453.58 → 2458.56] So however much revenue you brought in minus the cost.
[2458.82 → 2465.92] Because a lot of the time you'll have POs cut and checks cashed for stuff that won't hit your warehouse for another two months.
[2466.12 → 2466.16] Right.
[2466.16 → 2468.60] So how does that work into the calculation?
[2468.68 → 2471.40] And then you might have, like, a launch of a line of products.
[2471.50 → 2472.64] I don't think we've done that yet.
[2472.82 → 2477.40] But you might eventually have a launch of a line of products, and you might hold them for a while before you launch them.
[2477.46 → 2480.90] So the payment is going out for that way before you're getting any income.
[2481.00 → 2483.40] And then you're getting tons of income when maybe there's no out.
[2483.92 → 2484.28] Yeah.
[2484.46 → 2486.90] So it's a little bit difficult to calculate.
[2487.32 → 2488.20] Like, how do we...
[2488.20 → 2489.06] To be clear, I know nothing about it.
[2489.06 → 2495.38] How do we subtract our inventory liability from the profit that we've made and the payroll that we pay?
[2495.38 → 2496.38] But that is not...
[2496.98 → 2499.30] It's not on quite the same balance sheet.
[2499.40 → 2500.82] So I'm not quite sure how to do that.
[2501.90 → 2507.46] Also, some of the main ways that we discussed last time really haven't changed that much.
[2507.80 → 2513.74] And so a big part of the reason that I did that video was to just go, okay, look, guys.
[2514.22 → 2515.10] This cloak...
[2515.10 → 2515.90] Actually, it's funny.
[2516.02 → 2517.92] It's very related to what we're talking about right now.
[2518.28 → 2524.60] This cloak and dagger, you know, under the table payment system that you guys seem to think
[2524.60 → 2527.24] runs Linus Media Group isn't.
[2527.52 → 2533.50] In fact, the vast majority of our income comes from other sources like Amazon Affiliate, Google AdSense.
[2535.20 → 2538.24] At the time, Vessel was a big source of revenue.
[2538.58 → 2539.26] Now Float plane.
[2539.42 → 2539.72] Hooray.
[2539.88 → 2541.52] So from our community directly.
[2541.68 → 2544.26] Now it's merch, which is another form of community sponsorship.
[2545.28 → 2545.70] Yeah, you can...
[2545.70 → 2546.30] I got to fix your...
[2546.30 → 2546.92] Oh my God.
[2547.04 → 2548.56] Get this out.
[2549.90 → 2550.62] No, that's fine.
[2550.66 → 2551.52] We'll make Luke put it back.
[2551.60 → 2552.18] Yeah, I just...
[2552.18 → 2552.98] I know where it was.
[2553.08 → 2553.92] So just here.
[2554.16 → 2555.44] I don't want to forget it.
[2555.54 → 2555.88] No, no, no.
[2556.00 → 2557.22] We'll forget it there for sure.
[2557.30 → 2557.40] Here.
[2557.52 → 2557.76] Just...
[2557.76 → 2557.92] Yeah.
[2558.12 → 2558.56] It's empty.
[2558.74 → 2559.02] Oh Lord.
[2559.28 → 2559.38] Okay.
[2559.62 → 2559.78] Yeah.
[2560.66 → 2561.30] I just...
[2561.30 → 2561.90] I'll just...
[2561.90 → 2562.72] You can just go over here.
[2562.82 → 2563.04] It's fine.
[2563.32 → 2563.94] I just don't want to...
[2563.94 → 2564.70] I want to make sure I put it back.
[2564.70 → 2564.84] Yeah.
[2564.90 → 2569.38] A big part of the reason that I had wanted to do that so much was because I was trying to prove
[2569.38 → 2575.54] a point, but like, look, if I'm just completely transparent, will you guys finally stop with
[2575.54 → 2578.48] this conspiracy theory nonsense if I just tell you the real story?
[2578.60 → 2584.24] And the reality of it is that no, it didn't in fact change what a lot of people thought
[2584.24 → 2586.06] about me and about...
[2586.06 → 2586.20] Really?
[2586.58 → 2586.74] No.
[2586.88 → 2587.04] Yeah.
[2587.14 → 2588.82] It didn't seem to have much of an impact.
[2588.82 → 2593.50] The people who trusted us already, I think trusted us more, which is great.
[2593.94 → 2598.88] But the people who were sure that we're lying about it just thought we were lying more.
[2598.88 → 2600.14] We made up an even more elaborate lie.
[2600.18 → 2604.18] Something that I like is when you have this kind of situations where you have like community
[2604.18 → 2607.38] members and there's some that are on your side and there's some that are not on your
[2607.38 → 2614.68] side, even if it doesn't sway the battle, giving the people that are on your side an easier
[2614.68 → 2617.58] job is often nice.
[2618.12 → 2623.52] So like, even if it didn't necessarily help the noise, if you gave them that video, at
[2623.52 → 2626.00] least they can go copy, paste, look at this.
[2626.00 → 2629.28] If I'm going to white knight, I might as well have some great material to white knight with.
[2629.32 → 2629.64] Sure.
[2629.92 → 2630.16] Yeah.
[2630.28 → 2630.70] Fair enough.
[2630.92 → 2631.80] Someone's like, he's a shill.
[2631.86 → 2635.64] Just copy, paste the video and point at it with a little up arrow and then next post,
[2635.76 → 2636.02] whatever.
[2636.54 → 2638.18] It's nice to give them those things.
[2639.00 → 2639.94] We appreciate it.
[2639.94 → 2640.86] Can I help you with something, Nick?
[2641.10 → 2642.76] Your trees have been planted.
[2643.08 → 2643.98] My trees have been planted.
[2644.26 → 2644.76] Which ones?
[2647.44 → 2648.26] I think it's Twitter.
[2648.26 → 2649.44] Oh, right.
[2649.80 → 2650.30] Oh, okay.
[2651.26 → 2658.88] Speaking of, speaking of money, let's go ahead and, oh man, I'm not signed in to Twitter.
[2659.16 → 2660.52] Are you signed in to Twitter on that machine?
[2660.72 → 2660.96] Yes.
[2661.40 → 2661.84] Oh, really?
[2662.12 → 2662.42] Yes.
[2662.54 → 2662.78] Wow.
[2662.90 → 2663.12] Okay.
[2663.22 → 2664.58] Also, it doesn't matter that I'm not signing.
[2664.58 → 2665.72] I'm looking at it right now.
[2665.72 → 2673.58] So, today's video was a big collab, YouTube-wide pretty much.
[2673.70 → 2675.36] So many creators took part in this.
[2675.46 → 2681.12] It's a big tree planting push that was started by MrBeast to celebrate 20 million subscribers.
[2682.88 → 2688.42] And we agreed that if our community raised $10,000, we would match it.
[2689.26 → 2689.50] Cool.
[2689.50 → 2695.74] We have no idea if our community raised $10,000, but we just did it anyway because it seems
[2695.74 → 2697.88] like a thing that is good to do.
[2698.02 → 2699.24] Is there some way to even know?
[2699.90 → 2701.08] I don't think so.
[2701.88 → 2703.06] $1 plants a tree.
[2703.18 → 2704.20] Oh, that's exciting.
[2704.32 → 2704.76] That's fun.
[2704.94 → 2705.18] Yeah.
[2706.36 → 2710.90] So, I think it's up to, I can't tell how the counters are related to each other.
[2710.90 → 2716.22] So, it says that we've raised about $1.5 million over on teamtrees.org.
[2716.48 → 2718.86] So, I'm just going to, I guess, go there.
[2719.50 → 2719.82] Team.
[2719.96 → 2720.26] Oh, here.
[2720.32 → 2721.42] I'll just share your screen.
[2721.82 → 2725.54] And then YouTube shows, I think, like a quarter or half a million dollars.
[2725.64 → 2726.64] I haven't looked at it recently.
[2726.80 → 2729.18] So, I'm not sure if those are together or separate.
[2729.68 → 2734.36] But either way, a lot of freaking trees are going to be planted by the Arbour Foundation.
[2735.24 → 2738.22] And, yeah, that's a good thing.
[2738.76 → 2739.56] Wow, that's really cool.
[2739.72 → 2739.96] Yeah.
[2741.42 → 2745.64] Oh, look at these guys donating nine more than $10,000 so they get higher on the list.
[2746.60 → 2747.12] Ugh.
[2747.60 → 2748.16] Ugh.
[2748.64 → 2749.08] Whatever.
[2749.08 → 2750.02] Smart moves.
[2750.58 → 2750.86] Whatever.
[2751.10 → 2751.70] It's all good.
[2752.20 → 2753.04] Nifty tactics.
[2753.34 → 2753.62] Yep.
[2754.24 → 2755.04] You know what?
[2755.20 → 2757.14] If I'd thought of it, I'd have done it.
[2757.44 → 2757.50] Yeah.
[2758.50 → 2759.30] There you go.
[2761.42 → 2761.82] Okay.
[2761.82 → 2764.28] Next topic.
[2765.08 → 2765.58] I don't know.
[2765.58 → 2766.20] Ad spots.
[2766.20 → 2767.24] How far in are we?
[2767.36 → 2767.88] Ad spots.
[2767.88 → 2768.54] Oh, yeah.
[2768.60 → 2769.96] We should probably talk our sponsors.
[2770.18 → 2774.10] Speaking of getting paid by companies to show things on camera.
[2774.24 → 2774.48] Yeah.
[2774.48 → 2779.26] But definitely actually disclosed because that's how this stuff works.
[2779.26 → 2780.24] And consume them.
[2780.24 → 2781.34] Savage jerky.
[2781.76 → 2782.06] Yeah.
[2782.06 → 2782.34] Yeah.
[2783.22 → 2784.06] Oh, man.
[2784.06 → 2787.02] Last week on WAN show.
[2787.02 → 2792.08] I ended up taking my savage jerky home with me after the show because I didn't eat it on
[2792.08 → 2792.34] the show.
[2792.40 → 2792.74] I forgot.
[2792.84 → 2796.62] And I was like, there is no way I'm letting this go to waste.
[2797.90 → 2805.22] Savage jerky is delicious jerky that's designed to taste great and not be bad for you.
[2805.22 → 2810.20] It's handcrafted in small batches and doesn't use nitrates or preservatives, which results
[2810.20 → 2812.12] in an amazing tasting jerky.
[2812.58 → 2816.16] It doesn't have nasty ingredients that are known to give you cancer.
[2816.92 → 2818.10] Nitrates are terrible.
[2818.28 → 2818.40] Yeah.
[2818.88 → 2820.42] Actually, the nitrates aren't bad.
[2821.08 → 2824.48] I think it's what they react with like in your body that's terrible or something.
[2824.86 → 2825.80] So they're bad.
[2826.74 → 2831.04] They have 13 different flavours from their sweet teriyaki to their intense spicy Carolina
[2831.04 → 2831.28] Reaper.
[2831.28 → 2836.54] They make delicious hot sauces, barbecue sauces, and even spice rubs.

[2852.38 → 2852.82] Thumbnail.
[2853.22 → 2854.86] What are you sending me stuff for?
[2855.02 → 2856.56] I'm trying to do WAN show here.
[2858.42 → 2860.02] Is this thumbnail fine?
[2861.28 → 2862.96] Oh, yeah.
[2863.00 → 2863.60] What is that for?
[2864.50 → 2864.98] Corsair.

[2866.76 → 2867.26] Oh, cool.
[2867.80 → 2868.08] Yep.
[2868.26 → 2868.46] Sure.

[2913.80 → 2914.20] Dang.
[2914.62 → 2915.74] That's actually pretty sick.
[2915.82 → 2917.06] A five-character URL.
[2917.18 → 2917.92] That must be doing all right.
[2918.04 → 2918.52] Probably, yeah.
[2918.58 → 2919.32] That was probably some money.
[2921.46 → 2922.86] Show's also brought to you by PIA.
[2923.52 → 2924.70] P-I-A.
[2925.18 → 2926.78] I love the like, superhero intro.
[2926.98 → 2929.50] The VPN that didn't get hacked and then not disclose it.
[2933.08 → 2934.24] I mean, yeah.
[2934.48 → 2936.12] I dodged such a bullet there.
[2936.14 → 2936.60] You did.
[2936.60 → 2944.08] Like, we were very close to ending up working with that other VPN.
[2944.36 → 2948.58] I'm not going to mention the name of another VPN in a sponsored spot for PIA.
[2948.84 → 2949.02] Yeah.
[2949.20 → 2950.20] That seems in poor taste.
[2950.32 → 2961.78] But there was another VPN quite well regarded, quite well known, that we were very close to partnering with when we ended up abandoning our partnership with a tunnel bear.
[2961.78 → 2973.12] And we ended up going with PIA because, as Luke and I had disclosed on the show, in addition to using Tunnel Bear, who we were sponsored by at the time for, like, you know, our mom or whatever.
[2973.46 → 2973.60] Yeah.
[2973.60 → 2975.22] Because they needed something easy to use.
[2975.28 → 2976.40] And that thing that happened at PAX.
[2976.40 → 2978.90] Both of us had personal PIA accounts.
[2979.06 → 2979.12] Yes.
[2979.12 → 2982.80] And I had just, I had had a very good experience with them over a year plus that I'd had an account.
[2983.02 → 2984.22] And so I was like, you know what?
[2984.74 → 2988.56] All other things being equal, I'm going to go with the one that I'm happy with.
[2989.30 → 2996.04] And I'm really, really glad we did because, to be clear, something could happen with PIA in the future.
[2996.20 → 2996.70] A hundred percent.
[2997.54 → 2999.02] Nothing is hack-proof.
[2999.22 → 2999.86] A hundred percent.
[2999.86 → 3006.98] But at least PIA didn't have a big problem recently and then failed to disclose it in a timely manner.
[3007.10 → 3007.24] Yeah.
[3007.36 → 3008.68] Not even, like, that recently.
[3008.84 → 3009.02] Yeah.
[3009.18 → 3010.02] Like, months ago.
[3010.16 → 3013.46] Because the timely manner was, like, a long time ago.
[3013.56 → 3013.70] Yeah.
[3014.72 → 3017.62] So PIA, we trust them.
[3019.00 → 3020.50] LEG.GG slash PIA when.
[3020.58 → 3021.12] Go check it out.
[3022.12 → 3022.36] Whoops.
[3022.54 → 3023.98] I keep accidentally clicking that.
[3024.86 → 3025.30] All right.
[3025.36 → 3025.90] I'm just going to finish.
[3025.92 → 3026.28] I promise.
[3026.42 → 3029.36] I'm just going to finish this piece of jerky, and then I will get back to talking about the news.
[3030.56 → 3032.04] What news topic do you want to talk about next?
[3032.06 → 3032.60] Whatever you want.
[3032.84 → 3033.16] Okay.
[3034.76 → 3036.14] I didn't go through the initial read.
[3036.34 → 3037.34] Shroud, did you talk about that?
[3037.72 → 3038.06] No, yeah.
[3038.36 → 3039.06] Okay, let's do that.
[3039.08 → 3040.12] Just pardon me for a second.
[3040.20 → 3040.58] I'm just saving my jerky.
[3040.58 → 3040.94] No worries.
[3041.38 → 3047.34] Shroud, one of Twitch's biggest stars and a person that LTT recently did a collab with,
[3047.68 → 3052.12] and in my opinion, potentially the greatest FPS player of all time,
[3052.12 → 3056.06] has moved from Twitch to Mixer, along with Ninja.
[3056.44 → 3057.20] Very interesting.
[3057.20 → 3059.72] He has 6.5 million followers on Twitch.
[3059.88 → 3064.10] He has now gathered 385,000 on Mixer.
[3064.90 → 3067.00] That number will no doubt continue to go up.
[3067.16 → 3068.78] This was, and it's probably higher than.
[3068.80 → 3069.66] I know, I know, I know.
[3069.94 → 3072.82] It's probably higher than now than it was when this was written.
[3073.76 → 3080.40] He follows Ninja, like I mentioned, one of Twitch's, one of previously Twitch's most followed streamers in Jumping Ship.
[3080.40 → 3091.16] Dr. Disrespect subsequently claimed that he was approached by Mixer first, and it turned it down because Mixer has lower user engagement and less revenue opportunities.
[3091.44 → 3096.88] He claims he made more than both Shroud and Ninja, but it's also Dr. Disrespect.
[3096.88 → 3097.30] Yeah.
[3098.26 → 3099.00] He's kind of.
[3099.00 → 3101.66] I don't know if that was in character or not.
[3102.36 → 3104.54] It's really hard to tell with that dude.
[3105.16 → 3107.82] Well, no, because usually he goes no costume and stuff.
[3109.40 → 3111.48] When he goes no costume, he's usually out of character.
[3112.80 → 3115.48] And then I think it's, I don't know.
[3115.72 → 3116.12] Okay.
[3116.12 → 3119.40] I don't really watch Twitch or Mixer.
[3121.24 → 3122.28] So at any rate.
[3124.78 → 3129.94] Does this bode well for Mixer's future or will this Mixer exodus peter out?
[3130.02 → 3130.62] Let's discuss.
[3130.78 → 3131.96] I mean, you stream on Twitch.
[3132.24 → 3132.46] Yeah.
[3132.94 → 3134.46] Why stream on Twitch instead of Mixer?
[3135.32 → 3137.94] For me right now, I don't care.
[3138.44 → 3140.64] I say constantly that I'm a terrible streamer.
[3141.82 → 3143.90] I don't try to grow my audience.
[3143.90 → 3152.42] The amount of effort that I put into my stream outside literally sitting in the chair is as minimal as possible.
[3152.70 → 3156.56] There are stream elements on my stream that haven't worked in like two years.
[3156.88 → 3157.90] And I don't care.
[3159.14 → 3160.36] So all it really is for me.
[3160.46 → 3160.86] It is a bad stream.
[3161.02 → 3161.22] Yeah.
[3161.44 → 3162.38] And that's okay.
[3162.68 → 3168.12] Because all I really want to do is hang out with most of the people that have been showing up for like five, six years, seven years.
[3168.96 → 3170.54] And if new people show up, cool.
[3170.90 → 3171.92] If you want to hang out, cool.
[3171.92 → 3173.96] But outside of that, don't care.
[3174.14 → 3174.74] I have a job.
[3174.82 → 3176.52] I don't want that to be my job specifically.
[3177.06 → 3178.34] I don't want it to get too big, etc.
[3178.54 → 3182.44] So if I move to Mixer, I would need to make sure they all came with me.
[3184.28 → 3185.88] And there's, I mean, the thing is.
[3186.04 → 3187.40] Because it's not a money thing for me.
[3187.48 → 3189.02] So if Mixer was like, here's a bunch of money.
[3189.08 → 3192.20] I'm like, well, unless it's like really a bunch of money.
[3192.48 → 3194.64] But then why would they care about my crappy stream?
[3194.64 → 3196.78] There's pretty much no way to do it.
[3196.86 → 3204.16] I mean, we look at the disparity between the six and a half million followers on Twitch and the 300,000 to 400,000 on Mixer.
[3204.16 → 3205.52] You know how sub growth works.
[3205.64 → 3206.74] I do know how sub growth works.
[3206.74 → 3215.50] Well, that's what I'm trying to say is if we were to go, like, let's say Microsoft created Mixture or something.
[3215.70 → 3217.08] You know, a competitor to YouTube.
[3217.08 → 3224.10] And they were to offer us a gigantic bag of money, which I haven't asked Mike.
[3224.32 → 3230.80] I don't have the kind of relationship with him where I could be like, hey, so how much do we pay?
[3231.32 → 3234.38] You know, like we're not tight like that or anything.
[3234.46 → 3238.94] And if we were, it would be with the understanding that I'm not going to talk about it on the WAN show.
[3240.60 → 3244.16] So I have no idea how much the bag of money would have had to have been.
[3244.16 → 3249.44] And I do have to assume that there would be a bag of money because I can tell you guys in no uncertain terms,
[3249.58 → 3257.24] there is no chance that we would be going over to Mixture unless we were being offered a lucrative enough deal
[3257.24 → 3265.30] that not only were we getting any shortfall that we were going to be experiencing over the long period of time.
[3265.30 → 3268.78] It's taken 10 years to get Linus Tech Tips to where it is.
[3268.92 → 3273.76] So I am expecting the shortfall that I'm going to experience over that entire period of time
[3273.76 → 3274.70] to be made up.
[3275.00 → 3278.72] Plus, I would be asking for a big lump sum in cash.
[3278.88 → 3279.10] Yeah, of course.
[3279.10 → 3286.96] And the reason for that is that there is a huge opportunity cost to, how do I put this,
[3287.62 → 3290.60] to fading your star.
[3290.60 → 3300.04] Because a big part of the way that influencers make money is not just through views or subscribers.
[3300.38 → 3304.24] It's through the perception that they are a big star.
[3304.38 → 3308.48] So for someone like a shroud or a ninja or a Dr. Disrespect or whoever the case may be,
[3308.84 → 3318.08] being one of the biggest stars in a particular space is something that there's a value to having a number attached to.
[3318.08 → 3325.86] And when you lose that number, you potentially make yourself less attractive to agencies that just quite frankly have no idea what they're doing.
[3325.96 → 3332.84] Like we worked with an agency a little while ago that mostly had experience working with Instagram influencers.
[3333.60 → 3335.38] And it was fascinating.
[3335.38 → 3337.98] You would think the rules are all basically the same.
[3338.48 → 3343.54] You know, make sure that you put us up in a hotel that's not infested with cockroaches.
[3343.66 → 3346.94] Make sure that the bus leaves on time to whatever event we're supposed to attend.
[3347.52 → 3354.04] And, you know, hey, we need some time with the product or the thing, whatever it is, so that we can cover it.
[3354.04 → 3358.04] And they just had no idea how to engage with us.
[3358.14 → 3361.06] And all the transportation stuff and everything was sort of fine.
[3361.24 → 3365.72] But the schedule for the event was completely designed around Instagrammers.
[3365.94 → 3368.80] And the structure of the event was designed around Instagrammers.
[3369.02 → 3376.88] So there's like this big unveiling and show and song and dance thing, literally a song and dance, that went on.
[3376.88 → 3381.26] And I was like, okay, where's my hands on time?
[3381.32 → 3382.50] It's because they want stories, I guess.
[3382.58 → 3383.66] I don't know anything about Instagram.
[3383.66 → 3384.02] Exactly.
[3384.22 → 3384.32] Yeah.
[3384.66 → 3389.76] Because most of the people that were there, and it was a huge event, like 100, 200 different influencers.
[3389.96 → 3390.78] I hate that word.
[3390.82 → 3395.92] But I have to use it because once a word takes root, that's it.
[3395.98 → 3396.76] That's the word for it.
[3396.76 → 3397.60] I don't make the rules here.
[3398.00 → 3400.46] So they must have had 100, 200 influencers there.
[3400.82 → 3404.78] And all of them were like, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.
[3404.78 → 3406.50] And their job is done or whatever.
[3407.16 → 3409.48] Meanwhile, I'm sitting here going, I have to make a video.
[3410.56 → 3421.16] I had literally, literally half an hour of time scheduled to talk to anyone with an engineering background and make a video.
[3421.54 → 3422.02] Oh, gosh.
[3422.02 → 3423.06] I can't do that.
[3423.16 → 3423.76] No, that's not good.
[3423.88 → 3424.72] That's not good.
[3424.86 → 3432.32] So I ended up skipping a bunch of the other spectacle monsters in order to get some time to talk to an engineer.
[3432.88 → 3434.68] And they were like, well, why would you want to do that?
[3434.68 → 3437.50] I was like, because I need to make a video.
[3439.28 → 3441.38] Because I'm trying to do my job.
[3441.44 → 3451.34] This seems like a different version of when you walk into a place, and you can tell it's 100% structured for like, I was just going to say print media, but like written media.
[3451.48 → 3452.00] Absolutely.
[3452.00 → 3454.50] Like website stuff, not video.
[3454.68 → 3455.08] Absolutely.
[3455.54 → 3457.66] Where like, it'll be little things.
[3458.12 → 3461.12] Like for example, there will be a deck that they'll give you.
[3461.16 → 3464.50] They'll give you a PowerPoint of the presentation that went on the stage.
[3464.50 → 3469.32] But they won't give you a version of it without the watermarks until five minutes before the embargo.
[3469.32 → 3469.72] Yeah.
[3469.86 → 3478.96] And I go, oh, please tell me more about your magic processor that you can render a video and upload it to YouTube with in less than five minutes.
[3478.98 → 3479.98] Get it processed on YouTube.
[3479.98 → 3487.50] Like help me help you because we're both going to look like unprofessional idiots if we have a watermark all over the slides in our freaking video.
[3487.72 → 3490.56] And I don't want to be two hours late because that's stupid.
[3490.90 → 3493.02] I need the slides ahead of time.
[3493.44 → 3495.52] It's the very nature of the business.
[3495.72 → 3503.66] Besides, the whole freaking thing leaked already anyway because you let people into the presentation with their cell phones taking pictures of the slides.
[3503.66 → 3507.50] What difference does it make at this point?
[3507.68 → 3508.92] Sit a rep with us if you want.
[3508.98 → 3509.48] I don't care.
[3509.60 → 3510.62] Just let us do our job.
[3511.86 → 3514.14] Can you do the Instagram noise again?
[3514.50 → 3515.58] I'm getting, no, I can't.
[3515.74 → 3517.78] I actually don't remember what noise I made.
[3518.86 → 3520.98] I couldn't stop hearing it for a while.
[3521.12 → 3522.24] What was it, click or something?
[3523.00 → 3525.26] I can't, there's no way I'd be able to do it.
[3525.52 → 3526.92] I'm going to have to watch that back though.
[3527.38 → 3531.32] That was freaking, oh, that took me a second to like actually absorb it.
[3531.52 → 3532.14] That was funny though.
[3532.32 → 3532.52] Okay.
[3533.66 → 3535.24] To bring it all the way back though.
[3535.34 → 3535.62] Yes.
[3536.32 → 3537.72] Does this bode well for Mixer's future?
[3538.10 → 3540.96] Will this Mixer Exodus peter out?
[3541.04 → 3544.90] You were talking about why someone might not want to go and how much it might cost.
[3545.00 → 3546.60] You asked me why I don't go, et cetera.
[3546.82 → 3552.36] So this can bode well for Mixer, but it really depends on Microsoft's commitment to Mixer.
[3552.88 → 3561.22] So there's no doubt in my mind that between Ninja and Shroud, millions or maybe even tens of millions of dollars have been committed at this point.
[3561.22 → 3565.46] Again, I don't know Mike and I don't even know Ninja's real name.
[3565.82 → 3567.92] So I definitely don't know him.
[3568.20 → 3572.06] So I have no knowledge of the inner workings of this deal.
[3572.18 → 3573.84] I knew Mike, but I also didn't know.
[3574.34 → 3574.84] Go figure.
[3575.08 → 3575.72] Branding, right?
[3575.86 → 3576.04] Yeah.
[3576.04 → 3576.40] Anyway.
[3576.68 → 3576.86] Yeah.
[3577.52 → 3580.18] So I have no real knowledge of this.
[3580.18 → 3592.46] I just know based on their footprint and based on how big and risky of a move this is, for me to make a similar move, it would have to be stupid.
[3593.04 → 3598.00] It would have to just be like, sorry, is there an extra zero or two on this?
[3598.08 → 3599.76] Because this makes no sense.
[3599.76 → 3607.92] Like for me to abandon YouTube at this point where I have invested a decade of my life, like it's not as simple.
[3608.04 → 3609.48] And it was a very risky commit.
[3609.70 → 3610.14] Absolutely.
[3610.90 → 3611.72] And it was successful.
[3612.52 → 3619.54] So like doing another very risky commit after succeeding the first very risky commit is, you know.
[3619.54 → 3629.22] Speaking of risky, it is extremely risky to be putting NVIDIA sponsored product placement in the back of your videos and not disclosing that.
[3629.32 → 3629.86] Hey, Jay.
[3631.58 → 3634.32] Well, I think the FCC has something to say about that.
[3635.02 → 3635.38] Yeah.
[3635.64 → 3635.92] Yeah.
[3636.20 → 3636.68] Bad.
[3636.84 → 3637.60] Bad dog.
[3637.70 → 3638.00] No.
[3638.44 → 3639.92] I'm pretty sure that's what they have to say about that.
[3639.92 → 3640.42] Have you been?
[3640.54 → 3640.92] Have you been?
[3641.20 → 3641.38] Sorry.
[3641.50 → 3646.58] We're kicking back to a previous topic here because Jay takes 45 minutes to return my calls.
[3647.44 → 3648.60] I was in the gym.
[3648.60 → 3650.16] I'm trying to work out some of that.
[3650.72 → 3651.64] Good job, Jay.
[3652.56 → 3661.30] So have you heard about the drama with YouTubers being accused of taking money from NVIDIA to feature their products in the background of videos?
[3662.88 → 3663.58] Yeah, I have.
[3663.66 → 3664.98] I've been pretty vocal against it.
[3664.98 → 3668.54] I mean, annual thing with NVIDIA, isn't it?
[3668.60 → 3669.72] It's just some other NVIDIA story.
[3671.18 → 3673.02] You broke up a little bit there.
[3674.44 → 3674.90] Oh, sorry.
[3675.02 → 3677.62] I said, yeah, I've been pretty vocal against it.
[3677.62 → 3682.42] But then I went on to say, isn't this just the annual NVIDIA drama story?
[3682.52 → 3683.72] It's just something different every year?
[3684.24 → 3686.26] Yeah, it kind of is looking that way.
[3686.30 → 3687.42] So I just wanted to confirm.
[3687.42 → 3702.36] I felt like for our viewers, I owe them, you know, using my phone book and my cell phone to get some confirmation that whoever this person supposedly thinks they're talking about, it's nonsense.
[3702.72 → 3705.72] So you're not getting secret money from NVIDIA?
[3705.72 → 3708.50] No, it's not me.
[3708.56 → 3712.58] And can I go on to say that they're the only company of the big three that's ever paid me dollars?
[3715.42 → 3716.02] That's funny.
[3716.72 → 3722.32] We have sponsored Intel and sponsored AMD content, but never from NVIDIA.
[3722.32 → 3727.14] I would love to say that that surprises me, but that would be a bald-faced lie.
[3728.86 → 3729.10] Yeah.
[3729.50 → 3729.70] Yeah.
[3730.20 → 3731.14] It's irony, right?
[3731.56 → 3732.22] I know, right?
[3732.92 → 3737.04] It's like if I'm going to be accused of selling out, it'd be nice to actually at least get to cash the check.
[3737.26 → 3737.50] Yeah.
[3737.94 → 3741.20] If I have to go to the penalty box, I would like to have actually done the penalty.
[3741.54 → 3741.72] Yeah.
[3741.82 → 3745.60] At least, you know, if you're going to put baby in the corner, make sure it's a valid reason.
[3745.74 → 3746.02] Yeah.
[3746.44 → 3746.72] Yeah.
[3746.72 → 3747.40] All right.
[3747.46 → 3748.00] Thanks, Jay.
[3748.40 → 3748.98] Bye, Jay.
[3749.52 → 3750.00] All right, guys.
[3750.04 → 3750.44] Have a good show.
[3750.58 → 3750.92] All right.
[3750.94 → 3751.12] Bye.
[3752.28 → 3752.96] So there you go.
[3753.20 → 3754.96] Yet another tech YouTuber.
[3755.38 → 3756.94] Anyway, back to this whole thing.
[3757.00 → 3758.06] So it's a huge risk.
[3758.18 → 3758.34] Yeah.
[3759.46 → 3762.34] And it didn't work out for Vessel.
[3762.70 → 3765.32] I think that's the most comparable thing I can think of.
[3765.34 → 3769.06] And in that case, I wasn't even being asked to switch platforms.
[3769.36 → 3772.08] I was just being asked to upload to platforms.
[3772.08 → 3777.02] But the model that Vessel is using to acquire talent is very similar.
[3777.80 → 3779.24] I would assume.
[3779.50 → 3779.62] Word.
[3779.74 → 3784.06] Here's a minimum guarantee to cover that shortfall that you're going to have.
[3784.22 → 3785.68] And by the way, here's a big signing bonus.
[3785.94 → 3787.96] I am assuming that it is a similar model.
[3788.06 → 3790.60] Now, Vessel ran out of money, allegedly.
[3790.98 → 3793.16] But Microsoft won't.
[3794.20 → 3800.16] So really, the only question here is what's Microsoft's commit level?
[3800.16 → 3805.18] And that's a bigger question because we're also asking then, what is Microsoft's commit
[3805.18 → 3806.42] level to gaming?
[3806.72 → 3813.68] Because I think to them, Mixer is less about making money off live-streaming games and more
[3813.68 → 3816.06] about being vertically integrated.
[3816.52 → 3816.66] Okay?
[3816.76 → 3821.36] So they own game development studios and also relationships with game development studios.
[3821.60 → 3822.84] They own their own publisher.
[3823.14 → 3824.48] They own their own console.
[3824.86 → 3828.66] They own their own cloud infrastructure that allows people to stream games.
[3828.66 → 3834.04] They own the operating system that also interacts with the console to share licensing for game
[3834.04 → 3834.44] titles.
[3834.62 → 3841.04] Well, they also need, they need to finally succeed at owning a social media platform.
[3841.16 → 3843.70] I will say, I'm going to say two things on this topic.
[3843.92 → 3847.30] One is I think they need five at a minimum.
[3847.70 → 3849.32] I know some people have been talking about three.
[3849.52 → 3850.70] Like who's the next one going to be?
[3850.76 → 3851.66] And then maybe that'll be enough.
[3851.66 → 3854.86] I think they need five like killer streamers.
[3855.76 → 3860.60] And I don't mean killer as in they're all FPS players, but like, like big, big, big deal
[3860.60 → 3861.02] streamers.
[3861.08 → 3862.66] I think it needs five minimum.
[3863.42 → 3864.94] And then hopefully more on top of that.
[3865.04 → 3867.50] And then another one is about Mixer.
[3867.50 → 3873.44] I've actually been interested in switching to Mixer for a long time since way before Ninja
[3873.44 → 3874.04] ever went there.
[3874.60 → 3876.40] The reason why I was interested.
[3876.90 → 3880.28] And again, you know, my reason for why I didn't go is because I don't want to disturb
[3880.28 → 3882.20] my little community that I've had for like six years.
[3882.86 → 3889.52] But I've been interested because oddly enough, Mixer to me has always felt more gaming focused.
[3890.04 → 3890.38] Interesting.
[3890.38 → 3892.84] It has always felt kind of that way.
[3893.28 → 3895.04] And where Twitch has stagnated.
[3895.16 → 3896.28] IRL and all that.
[3896.32 → 3898.44] In a lot of their gaming stuff.
[3898.60 → 3898.82] Yep.
[3899.14 → 3902.16] But they've pushed super hard in all the segments that you just mentioned.
[3902.26 → 3902.40] Yep.
[3902.78 → 3905.84] Mixer has pushed forward continually in the gaming direction.
[3906.24 → 3909.76] They've tried to do a lot of really cool community integrations.
[3910.00 → 3912.34] And it might be a little bit rougher around the edges.
[3913.52 → 3915.64] But I find it very interesting.
[3915.98 → 3918.96] The only reason why I haven't gone is my little pocket community.
[3918.96 → 3926.40] So I think I understand the interest from I know a lot of Ninja's communication around
[3926.40 → 3931.52] his stuff was just I'm not a fan of like the direction of Twitch and how much control
[3931.52 → 3932.34] I have of how it works.
[3932.62 → 3933.54] Who knows how real that is.
[3933.78 → 3936.12] But I could understand it to a certain degree.
[3936.30 → 3936.76] Right.
[3936.96 → 3937.40] That's fair.
[3937.58 → 3941.42] Because coming from someone who doesn't even care at all, I felt the same way.
[3941.58 → 3943.40] So I guess there you go.
[3943.40 → 3949.72] So if Microsoft is actually this committed to gaming and is this committed to owning a
[3949.72 → 3951.38] social media platform for a change.
[3951.68 → 3951.88] Yeah.
[3952.14 → 3953.38] A relevant one.
[3953.52 → 3953.68] Yeah.
[3953.86 → 3955.14] Then absolutely.
[3955.56 → 3960.74] I think this does end in Mixer drawing significant market share away from Twitch.
[3960.74 → 3966.74] But as you just alluded to, there is no way that they're going to pull it off with just
[3966.74 → 3967.58] two big names.
[3967.72 → 3967.82] Yeah.
[3967.88 → 3968.02] No.
[3968.12 → 3970.88] They are going to have to keep putting money into this.
[3971.02 → 3973.82] And some of it is going to be an unmitigated disaster.
[3974.40 → 3977.64] Now, I don't think either Ninja or Shroud are going to be a disaster.
[3977.82 → 3983.40] Those guys have so much gravitational pull that they will bring users over.
[3983.52 → 3983.64] Yeah.
[3984.06 → 3986.52] But I think they're going to have a Misfire or two.
[3986.78 → 3988.62] There's no way they get it right every single time.
[3988.62 → 3990.06] But they're just going to have to keep doing it.
[3990.06 → 3992.18] I think they're going to need the five that I just mentioned.
[3992.28 → 3992.38] Yeah.
[3992.50 → 3997.18] I think they're also going to need, like, in maybe one wave, like 20.
[3998.00 → 4002.24] Because right now they're getting these massive, I don't know Twitch stats very well.
[4002.66 → 4005.94] Other than current big categories, which I'll talk about in a second.
[4007.08 → 4010.94] But they're getting these massive streamers that I'm assuming average like 20,000 viewers.
[4010.94 → 4019.94] I think they need to get five of, like, those and then step down, aim at, like, the 1,000 to 2,000 range and just get, like, 20 or 30 of them.
[4020.62 → 4021.36] Just shotgun.
[4022.72 → 4023.86] And some of those will miss.
[4024.04 → 4027.48] Because you'll have, yes, I think that's kind of where you're going to have some that might miss.
[4027.48 → 4037.80] You need to reach that momentum point where, you know what, the reality of it is if Shroud were to stream for four hours or something like that, nobody sits in.
[4037.86 → 4039.92] Okay, I shouldn't say anybody, but very few people sit and watch.
[4039.92 → 4040.96] You have a huge amount of churn.
[4041.28 → 4042.60] One stream for four hours.
[4042.72 → 4042.86] Yeah.
[4042.92 → 4047.60] There needs to be other stuff on the site to flip to and flip back.
[4047.60 → 4051.54] With that range that I just said, those are career streamers.
[4051.76 → 4051.96] Yeah.
[4052.56 → 4056.94] Like, that's probably their full-time job, and they're probably killing it.
[4057.40 → 4058.74] People with 1,000 concurrence?
[4058.86 → 4059.08] Yeah.
[4059.34 → 4061.04] That's all you need to succeed on Twitch?
[4061.04 → 4061.06] That's a lot.
[4061.06 → 4062.48] How many concurrences do we have right now?
[4062.48 → 4064.52] 1,000 concurrence all the time.
[4066.60 → 4068.08] How do I tell how many viewers we have?
[4068.08 → 4072.36] Do you even know how much money you make off of Twitch?
[4072.80 → 4075.04] Hey, I've got 1,000 viewers on Twitch right now.
[4075.06 → 4075.22] Woo!
[4075.48 → 4077.58] And you don't stream for long enough, and you don't stream for long enough.
[4077.60 → 4079.10] Don't promote your sub button and stuff.
[4079.58 → 4082.50] Because the thing is, here's some weird analytics into my channel.
[4082.72 → 4086.28] My channel has way more subscribers than I have average concurrent viewers.
[4086.66 → 4086.98] Right.
[4087.34 → 4089.90] And I think that's how it's going to be, because like you just said,
[4089.96 → 4091.46] you have people coming in and out of your channel.
[4091.46 → 4096.16] Average concurrence is actually a relatively weird way to measure channel performance.
[4096.94 → 4100.94] Like, I get astronomically more views on each stream than I have average concurrent viewers.
[4101.06 → 4101.56] I see.
[4102.02 → 4104.66] So, like, it's a lot of people.
[4104.66 → 4110.84] A thousand current viewers, if you can hold that number for a solid long stream, is a lot of people.
[4110.84 → 4115.52] And like, a lot of fans are really supportive.
[4115.74 → 4117.82] I get food delivered to me all the time.
[4117.82 → 4118.42] Like, there's...
[4118.42 → 4120.06] I'm pretty sure that's why you do it.
[4120.56 → 4121.88] The food is wonderful.
[4122.84 → 4123.64] But like...
[4123.64 → 4127.06] If they start sending you clothes, I don't think we'll be able to get you to come to work.
[4127.52 → 4130.06] Because I think that's the only thing that you still need from us.
[4130.06 → 4131.06] I'd wear...
[4131.06 → 4132.06] I'd say...
[4132.06 → 4133.54] That's kind of funny.
[4135.48 → 4137.06] But like, it's...
[4137.06 → 4139.20] Stream viewers are often extremely supportive.
[4140.34 → 4141.78] And you're going to get more...
[4141.78 → 4142.80] You're probably going to get...
[4142.80 → 4143.22] I don't know.
[4143.28 → 4144.14] I only have my analytics.
[4144.44 → 4147.20] But you're probably going to get more subscribers than you have average concurrence.
[4147.44 → 4151.30] At a thousand subscribers, that's 2,500 bucks a month.
[4151.44 → 4152.54] If you...
[4152.54 → 4156.06] If that was the exact amount of concurrent viewers that you had, you could definitely...
[4156.52 → 4157.06] That's...
[4157.06 → 4157.78] Whatever.
[4158.00 → 4158.54] You're doing good.
[4158.54 → 4162.44] I actually have no idea how many viewers are on YouTube right now.
[4162.48 → 4163.48] Because it's just broken.
[4164.02 → 4166.40] This stopped working at 20 after 5.
[4167.62 → 4168.80] So that's pretty cool.
[4169.02 → 4169.18] Who knows.
[4169.52 → 4170.30] But yeah, I don't know.
[4170.50 → 4171.34] 11K or something.
[4171.56 → 4172.16] Okay, cool.
[4172.72 → 4173.16] Okay.
[4173.70 → 4174.60] I made it, Mom.
[4176.72 → 4178.28] I think that's pretty much...
[4178.28 → 4178.72] Oh, wow.
[4178.76 → 4181.00] We didn't talk about the trifold phone.
[4181.34 → 4182.10] I wasn't even here.
[4182.26 → 4182.94] I didn't know there was one.
[4183.26 → 4186.32] TCL created a prototype dual hinge phone.
[4186.40 → 4186.60] Okay.
[4186.60 → 4191.76] Which folds in three parts and opens up to a huge 10-inch tablet.
[4192.54 → 4193.02] Okay.
[4193.08 → 4194.76] So the original article here is from CNET.
[4196.76 → 4198.78] Hey, look at that.
[4198.98 → 4200.10] I think every...
[4200.10 → 4200.54] Matter of time.
[4200.54 → 4208.64] The direction of product innovation has to have some things that slam and make sense and do well and has to have some of these.
[4208.64 → 4210.64] That looks thick AF.
[4211.60 → 4213.18] That looks super dumb.
[4213.84 → 4216.70] No name, no price, no window for release.
[4216.70 → 4219.78] But boy, is that ever a big screen.
[4219.90 → 4225.46] And based on my experience with the Galaxy Fold, I would at least give it a shot.
[4225.70 → 4227.14] Because I love the Fold.
[4227.46 → 4229.02] I know I'm not using it right now.
[4229.14 → 4232.54] But that's only because they took my Fold away to take B-roll of it.
[4233.02 → 4234.32] I am so excited to get it back.
[4234.32 → 4235.94] Looking at how you unfold this?
[4235.94 → 4237.18] Oh, yeah.
[4237.30 → 4239.30] No, it looks like a disaster.
[4239.30 → 4240.32] People are going to do it too quickly.
[4240.32 → 4241.16] I'm going to give it a chance.
[4241.42 → 4241.72] Okay.
[4241.88 → 4242.62] I'm going to give it a chance.
[4242.62 → 4243.24] I'm very interested.
[4243.52 → 4249.38] I said with the single Fold that I said I wasn't ready for it mainly because of price tag.
[4249.64 → 4250.86] But I think this is the future.
[4252.10 → 4253.64] I'm not saying the same thing here.
[4253.90 → 4255.80] I don't think this is the future.
[4255.80 → 4257.64] You don't think that's the future?
[4258.40 → 4259.52] Well, maybe you are just...
[4259.52 → 4260.88] I think you went too far, TCL.
[4261.84 → 4262.90] You took it too far.
[4262.92 → 4271.44] Speaking of taking things too far, Huawei is launching the Mate X in China on November 15th for $2,400.
[4272.22 → 4274.68] So we're going to try and get our hands on one.
[4274.78 → 4280.04] But I don't know that we'll be able to because getting China-only stuff is difficult sometimes.
[4280.82 → 4282.16] But we should definitely try.
[4282.26 → 4283.22] We should ask our...
[4283.22 → 4284.38] Do we even want to get our hands on one?
[4284.38 → 4285.10] Oh, definitely.
[4285.10 → 4287.06] With like all this stuff going on?
[4287.06 → 4287.36] Oh, yeah.
[4287.40 → 4287.86] I don't care.
[4288.00 → 4289.16] I want to get my hands on that thing.
[4289.20 → 4290.34] I want to know if it's any good.
[4290.62 → 4291.02] Okay.
[4291.34 → 4292.08] Maybe it's good.
[4292.24 → 4293.16] Maybe it sucks.
[4293.30 → 4293.98] We can try.
[4294.78 → 4296.02] Speaking of good...
[4296.02 → 4297.62] Goodbye.
[4298.32 → 4298.68] Yeah.
[4299.72 → 4300.88] Good see you later.
[4301.30 → 4302.12] Actually, no.
[4302.24 → 4307.08] We need to do some super chats, especially because we have a $250 super chat today.
[4307.44 → 4309.70] I am so sorry we missed the super chats last week.
[4309.74 → 4310.42] That was my bad.
[4310.78 → 4313.82] I clicked, and then I was like, super chat.
[4313.82 → 4315.50] And the stream was over.
[4315.78 → 4321.28] And going back live again is something that can be very destructive to the channel in terms
[4321.28 → 4322.16] of the YouTube algorithm.
[4322.32 → 4325.20] So it's something we really try hard not to do.
[4325.76 → 4328.08] See, and then I've had streams where I do it like 10 or 15 times.
[4328.16 → 4329.34] So I'm just trialling something out.
[4329.78 → 4330.96] I just don't care.
[4330.96 → 4332.84] I'm just rudely interrupted in the middle of the topic.
[4333.20 → 4333.42] Yeah.
[4333.70 → 4334.24] Yeah, me too.
[4334.44 → 4335.32] So hi, Alex.
[4336.34 → 4337.14] TT Plays.
[4337.22 → 4338.60] Any tips for a first-time PC builder?
[4339.02 → 4339.56] Watch a guide.
[4340.44 → 4341.54] Our old ones are still good.
[4341.54 → 4342.24] Which we do have.
[4342.24 → 4343.02] They're still good.
[4343.38 → 4344.20] You guys definitely have those.
[4344.20 → 4346.02] Just slightly older parts.
[4346.02 → 4349.56] Oh, Robert says, the red camera smartphones are gone.
[4349.64 → 4354.32] Yeah, actually, we considered making that our thumbnail and title for the WAN show today.
[4354.44 → 4356.34] But then I was like, did anyone care?
[4356.80 → 4357.36] Probably not.
[4357.42 → 4358.28] I think the answer was no.
[4359.44 → 4364.46] Star Citizen 890J says, Leicester City 9, Southampton 0.
[4365.02 → 4366.48] Is this a soccer score?
[4366.48 → 4367.16] It's a soccer score.
[4367.16 → 4372.26] John says, where's the intro where Linus is stuck in the 90s?
[4372.86 → 4373.98] That's every video.
[4374.58 → 4377.86] Other side guy, you should paint the Power Mac G5K space gray.
[4378.06 → 4378.80] I saw someone.
[4378.98 → 4381.22] I went to go get some pho.
[4381.66 → 4382.42] Some pho.
[4382.48 → 4382.78] Some pho.
[4382.78 → 4383.22] Some pho.
[4383.58 → 4384.72] At the spot.
[4384.76 → 4386.34] Why do you always bring it out of the frame?
[4386.36 → 4386.76] I don't know why.
[4386.76 → 4388.22] I like to face over.
[4388.36 → 4388.92] I don't know.
[4388.92 → 4388.94] I know.
[4389.14 → 4389.54] You're like.
[4390.72 → 4392.94] I went to go get some pho at the spot.
[4392.94 → 4397.72] And sitting outside of one of the stores close by was someone with a skateboard.
[4398.14 → 4398.64] Black jeans.
[4398.76 → 4399.24] Black shoes.
[4399.40 → 4399.90] Black sweater.
[4400.06 → 4400.58] Black shirt.
[4401.00 → 4402.44] Long, slick black hair.
[4402.80 → 4403.46] Some tattoos.
[4403.88 → 4404.42] Headphones.
[4404.66 → 4405.80] And I was like, perfect.
[4406.32 → 4407.02] Emo skaters.
[4407.32 → 4408.18] We're back.
[4408.24 → 4408.96] Are they back?
[4409.02 → 4410.40] I understand culture again.
[4410.62 → 4412.80] I was out of there for like 10 years.
[4412.90 → 4413.70] Were the jeans ripped?
[4414.04 → 4414.28] Yep.
[4414.50 → 4415.10] Yes!
[4415.10 → 4415.38] Yep.
[4415.62 → 4416.16] Like it was.
[4416.28 → 4417.76] I'm not going to be perfect at describing it.
[4417.82 → 4420.06] But it was like plucked right out of what?
[4420.14 → 4420.90] Like 2004?
[4421.44 → 4421.80] 2005?
[4421.80 → 4422.52] 2005?
[4422.52 → 4424.64] Like Jay and Silent Bob strike back kind of era.
[4424.74 → 4425.14] So good.
[4425.80 → 4426.60] So good.
[4427.32 → 4428.96] I was like, I appreciate your existence.
[4429.26 → 4430.24] Because I understand you.
[4430.40 → 4433.64] Other side guys suggest we paint our Power Mac G5 case space gray.
[4433.92 → 4435.54] We're probably going to go with black.
[4435.84 → 4438.04] And with maybe some orange accents.
[4438.14 → 4445.38] And the reason for that is that it's going to be more of like the LTT Mac Pro.
[4445.38 → 4448.78] So we have to paint it.
[4448.78 → 4448.98] Nice.
[4448.98 → 4453.08] Just because the case got like mangled by all the work that's been done on it.
[4454.40 → 4456.02] I think it's going to be black.
[4456.26 → 4457.44] It's probably going to be matte black.
[4458.14 → 4460.12] So hopefully that doesn't disappoint you too much.
[4460.76 → 4462.08] Brandon says, here you go hot boys.
[4462.20 → 4464.38] Have some opinion rewards balance from my work phone.
[4464.50 → 4465.44] How else would I use it?
[4465.86 → 4466.78] Also I have Luke Beat.
[4466.78 → 4468.20] I'm still on a 3930K.
[4468.48 → 4468.78] Nice.
[4469.30 → 4469.50] Sick.
[4469.58 → 4472.28] Jagger says, what's the chassis that you used for the render server?
[4472.42 → 4473.62] The one with the blue bezels.
[4473.80 → 4474.54] Oh crap.
[4474.60 → 4477.70] It's some I Star USA one if I recall correctly.
[4477.82 → 4478.30] Gosh dang it.
[4478.30 → 4482.62] And it's not like necessarily something I would recommend.
[4483.50 → 4485.90] Like we Frankensteined it together.
[4486.10 → 4487.18] And it works great.
[4487.40 → 4488.98] But it's not amazing or anything.
[4489.80 → 4490.48] Thanks Zach.
[4491.56 → 4495.02] Tommy Gunn says, is there a reason you released so many vids on YouTube out of order lately?
[4495.24 → 4496.96] Like the VR series and personal rig updates.
[4497.06 → 4497.90] I demand information.
[4497.90 → 4504.50] A lot of the time it has to do with simultaneous releases between float plane and YouTube that
[4504.50 → 4511.20] are dictated by like sponsors reviewing videos that need to go up at the same time or just
[4511.20 → 4514.00] something just plain not being done.
[4514.24 → 4518.58] Like we had a really, I usually guess it's down to like a sponsor spot move or something
[4518.58 → 4519.08] like that.
[4519.74 → 4525.32] We try to have it be a weak buffer consistently, but a lot of the time it's just not that simple.
[4525.32 → 4529.76] Um, Tinnitus says, donate you all a tree.
[4530.28 → 4532.42] Uh, that's not quite how that works.
[4533.02 → 4533.18] Yeah.
[4533.30 → 4534.18] That's a super chat.
[4534.26 → 4536.62] That's a different thing, but okay.
[4536.78 → 4537.60] Other side guy.
[4538.16 → 4541.00] Rip when every nice phone and PC part in Australia is a thousand dollars or more.
[4541.04 → 4541.14] Yeah.
[4541.16 → 4543.72] This must've been when we were discussing pricing in different regions.
[4544.40 → 4546.08] Uh, my pet fish RCS.
[4546.24 → 4548.18] I have a 970 and a 1440p monitor.
[4548.28 → 4548.90] I need to upgrade.
[4548.98 → 4551.50] I found a used Vegas 64 for 275 bucks.
[4551.96 → 4553.82] That seems not bad.
[4553.82 → 4559.16] Or should I go with something more modern like an RX 5700 XT or RTX 2070 Super?
[4559.34 → 4561.08] Vegas 64 for 275 bucks.
[4561.16 → 4562.92] That seems off the top of my head.
[4563.02 → 4564.20] That seems pretty darn good.
[4564.30 → 4565.04] Is that that old?
[4565.60 → 4566.86] No, that's not.
[4567.06 → 4567.18] Yeah.
[4567.20 → 4571.76] I don't think, I don't think you would like, it's not the newest thing ever, but I wouldn't
[4571.76 → 4572.72] say that's like ancient.
[4572.98 → 4573.62] I wouldn't worry about it.
[4573.66 → 4574.58] Something being more modern.
[4574.92 → 4578.88] Ilya Parasol says, do you feel like back in the old days, overclocking felt like deck in
[4578.88 → 4582.46] the system, and now you only use so much power you're allowed by the manufacturer?
[4583.74 → 4586.50] Honestly, we're going to be making a video about a product next week that makes me feel
[4586.50 → 4587.76] exactly like that.
[4588.48 → 4591.98] Raspberry Pi says, love from the Stylist Studios.
[4592.72 → 4595.96] We here really enjoy your in-depth content, so we want to show you some love and support.
[4596.22 → 4596.60] Oh, wow.
[4596.76 → 4597.18] Thank you.
[4597.18 → 4600.10] $250 Super chat.
[4600.20 → 4600.78] That's nuts.
[4601.22 → 4603.18] I think that's a...
[4603.18 → 4604.78] A what?
[4605.18 → 4605.44] Yeah.
[4605.60 → 4606.20] Did our stream die?
[4606.58 → 4606.84] Nope.
[4607.32 → 4607.48] Oh.
[4608.88 → 4609.32] We're good.
[4609.78 → 4613.26] AT Bull says, love watching your content.
[4613.40 → 4614.46] Here are five Canadian rupees.
[4615.10 → 4615.46] Thank you.
[4615.98 → 4619.92] Ilya says, could you please tell some story about last year's Scrapyard War Switch Girl and
[4619.92 → 4621.32] explain what the heck was that?
[4622.48 → 4623.46] It was Switch Girl.
[4623.72 → 4624.54] It was Switch Girl, dude.
[4624.60 → 4624.80] Yeah.
[4625.24 → 4625.74] Switch Girl.
[4626.16 → 4626.76] What do you want to know?
[4626.78 → 4627.06] What's up?
[4627.18 → 4627.62] It was Switch Girl.
[4627.62 → 4628.02] What's up?
[4628.16 → 4628.30] Yeah.
[4628.40 → 4628.78] Switch Girl.
[4628.96 → 4629.12] Yeah.
[4629.56 → 4630.90] Like, explain what?
[4631.00 → 4631.20] Yeah.
[4631.60 → 4631.86] Yeah.
[4633.80 → 4634.40] Sup, bro?
[4634.62 → 4634.88] Yeah.
[4635.18 → 4635.54] Switch Girl.
[4635.68 → 4635.84] Yeah.
[4636.06 → 4636.36] All right.
[4638.08 → 4642.34] Okay, in all seriousness, though, Brand sponsored Scrapyard Wars, so she was playing Switch with
[4642.34 → 4643.68] a Brand skin on it.
[4644.14 → 4645.14] That's all there was to it.
[4645.20 → 4649.08] People were, like, people were beside themselves, like, mad about it.
[4649.08 → 4651.26] That was, that, I mean, that was product placement.
[4651.36 → 4652.26] But we just closed it.
[4652.28 → 4652.50] Yeah.
[4655.92 → 4656.72] Good job.
[4656.72 → 4657.88] All right.
[4657.88 → 4657.90] All right.
[4657.90 → 4659.10] We only have time for a couple more.
[4660.68 → 4662.48] Megan says, just got one.
[4662.48 → 4664.82] And why does the Swacked have a left-hand zipper?
[4666.68 → 4667.96] What are left-hand zippers?
[4668.28 → 4669.84] They're saying it's on that side, so.
[4669.84 → 4670.62] Oh, wow.
[4670.74 → 4671.12] I never.
[4672.86 → 4674.52] All of mine are just kind of random.
[4674.90 → 4677.38] So I just kind of don't think about it.
[4677.46 → 4679.32] There isn't, like, a rhyme or reason anymore, really.
[4679.84 → 4680.52] Oh, okay.
[4680.52 → 4685.90] It used to be, like, allegedly men's was on the right and women's was on the left.
[4685.90 → 4686.10] Yeah.
[4686.10 → 4687.16] Like, buttoning or something.
[4687.80 → 4688.18] Oh.
[4688.62 → 4689.52] For, like, dress shirts.
[4689.60 → 4689.84] Yeah.
[4690.20 → 4695.16] But, like, in the research that we've done, there's, like, no set guidance anymore.
[4695.26 → 4695.36] Oh.
[4695.36 → 4696.88] It's just kind of, like, do what you please.
[4697.66 → 4698.04] Okay.
[4698.28 → 4698.52] So.
[4698.82 → 4699.16] Okay.
[4699.88 → 4703.76] It probably would be a good idea for us to make all of ours the same.
[4703.98 → 4705.90] I think ours is the same between Stealth and Swacked.
[4706.04 → 4706.46] Oh, okay.
[4706.60 → 4708.70] But it's just on the left.
[4709.18 → 4710.88] No one has ever asked that before.
[4710.88 → 4711.98] How is a zipper even on the left?
[4712.06 → 4712.52] I don't get it.
[4712.54 → 4714.32] Well, where the piece that moves is.
[4714.78 → 4716.00] Instead of being here, it's here.
[4716.24 → 4716.42] Yeah.
[4716.46 → 4716.76] Oh.
[4717.40 → 4718.46] Oh, wow.
[4718.72 → 4720.62] I would have never noticed that.
[4720.64 → 4722.28] Yeah, in a thousand years, I would have never noticed that.
[4722.28 → 4723.68] You get really used to it really quickly.
[4723.68 → 4724.12] Yeah.
[4724.26 → 4724.66] Okay.
[4726.04 → 4728.24] 1800Sweet says, shout out to my friend Kobe.
[4728.24 → 4729.56] Happy birthday for next week.
[4729.74 → 4730.54] Happy birthday, Kobe.
[4730.68 → 4731.20] Shout out.
[4732.34 → 4734.24] Leo G says, where did the Constellation shirt go?
[4734.28 → 4737.20] It disappeared from the store after having a restocking date of October 2019.
[4737.32 → 4738.36] It is coming back soon.
[4739.36 → 4740.14] Within two weeks.
[4740.22 → 4740.90] Within two weeks.
[4741.24 → 4741.54] Hopefully.
[4741.74 → 4745.20] B Gross says, I'm finally listening to the entire WAN Show archive, and I'm starting again
[4745.20 → 4745.72] from the beginning.
[4745.98 → 4747.66] Thanks for having audio download links.
[4748.22 → 4750.56] You're listening to the entire WAN Show archive?
[4750.70 → 4751.72] Why would you do that?
[4751.74 → 4751.92] Why?
[4751.92 → 4758.76] There are a couple of shows that I think I'd like to listen back on, but not all of them.
[4758.76 → 4759.10] What number do you think we're at?
[4759.18 → 4760.24] Like 400 or something?
[4760.24 → 4760.64] I don't know.
[4760.70 → 4762.34] It's some obscene number of WAN Shows.
[4762.72 → 4764.12] Robert sent another chat.
[4764.24 → 4766.68] Obviously, all super chats are made by Shills as well.
[4766.78 → 4769.74] Don't forget to visit LTT forums and discard for your daily tech pilling.
[4770.22 → 4771.80] Don't forget WAN Show is pre-recorded.
[4771.88 → 4772.36] Thanks, Robert.
[4772.88 → 4773.88] And LTTstore.com.
[4773.88 → 4774.88] LTTstore.com.
[4776.84 → 4782.06] More says, despite comprising a mere 13% of game production, Blizzard manages to ban
[4782.06 → 4783.86] over 50% of Hong Kong supporters.
[4784.32 → 4786.12] How is the ghost pepper jerky on the way out?
[4788.86 → 4789.72] A lot better on the way in.
[4789.72 → 4790.32] It's totally fine.
[4791.06 → 4791.50] For me.
[4791.68 → 4792.74] Actually, the ghost pepper one?
[4792.90 → 4793.52] Yeah, it doesn't.
[4793.68 → 4794.38] Actually, no.
[4794.48 → 4795.52] That one's not as bad.
[4795.62 → 4798.16] The Carolina Reaper one, I ate like an entire bag of it once.
[4798.22 → 4801.72] I have never had the bad on the way out experience with anything spicy.
[4802.16 → 4802.56] Really?
[4802.80 → 4803.08] Never.
[4803.08 → 4804.90] You must have a butthole of steel.
[4805.04 → 4806.62] It's solid iron.
[4806.72 → 4807.62] Or just dead nerves.
[4807.80 → 4807.96] Yeah.
[4812.10 → 4815.96] Clint Talbert says, don't know what a super chat is for, but I love your channel.
[4818.10 → 4819.40] Well, that cost you $10.
[4822.10 → 4824.32] Alex says, here's some New Zealand rupees.
[4825.56 → 4828.54] Also, you need to make a big float plane box for that product placement.
[4828.86 → 4829.18] Nice.
[4829.18 → 4832.06] We actually have a really exciting float plane video coming.
[4832.06 → 4832.62] Yeah.
[4832.98 → 4834.28] Are you doing the thing?
[4834.84 → 4835.56] Like the announcement?
[4835.94 → 4836.24] No.
[4836.44 → 4836.94] Oh, what thing?
[4837.14 → 4842.52] You looked up the website, and you saw availability while we were looking at the script.
[4842.88 → 4844.58] I don't want to say what it is.
[4844.58 → 4848.04] You'd be going to be going to a place.
[4850.54 → 4851.66] I'm going to take that as a no.
[4851.66 → 4852.18] Oh, yeah.
[4852.18 → 4853.26] I totally forgot about that.
[4853.38 → 4853.50] Oh.
[4853.70 → 4856.48] We're probably going to simplify it just because I'm tired and busy.
[4856.48 → 4864.02] But we're finally going to be announcing that float plane is going to be taking requests from people who want to join.
[4864.02 → 4865.82] It's beta.
[4866.42 → 4868.54] It's still beta, but it's like beta now.
[4868.66 → 4870.32] It's not like pre-alpha.
[4870.70 → 4870.96] Yeah.
[4871.52 → 4873.16] So it's really, really exciting.
[4873.78 → 4875.68] Also, we don't know how to do stages properly.
[4876.08 → 4879.98] We're going to shoot that next week, and hopefully it'll be up in the very near future.
[4880.52 → 4883.38] So good luck, everybody.
[4883.80 → 4884.00] Yeah.
[4884.00 → 4885.32] Thanks for watching today.
[4885.42 → 4886.04] See you next week.
[4886.14 → 4887.18] Same bad time, same bad channel.
[4887.36 → 4887.64] Bye.
[4888.94 → 4889.90] Now I can do this.
[4890.08 → 4890.96] You can't even say anything.
[4914.00 → 4923.76] As I was taking it away, I was like, oh.
[4923.76 → 4926.02] That provided so much entertainment on the show today.
[4926.16 → 4926.68] Good work.
[4927.04 → 4927.46] Thank you.
