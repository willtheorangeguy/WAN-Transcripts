[0.00 --> 0.64]  Let's do it.
[0.76 --> 1.46]  We're starting streaming.
[1.64 --> 2.34]  We're live.
[2.56 --> 6.16]  Just so you guys know and you know, we're on the WAN show.
[6.36 --> 6.64]  Welcome.
[7.32 --> 8.20]  It's a nah show, dude.
[8.50 --> 8.88]  It's right.
[8.96 --> 9.56]  It's a nah show.
[9.64 --> 11.08]  This is a bona fide nah show.
[11.22 --> 12.16]  Because it's James and I.
[12.70 --> 14.08]  Yes, it's backwards.
[14.20 --> 16.20]  We did like a half nah last week.
[16.84 --> 17.70]  What is that called?
[18.46 --> 18.76]  A wana?
[18.90 --> 19.34]  A wana?
[19.72 --> 20.06]  A wana?
[21.76 --> 26.32]  Either way, we got some stuff to talk about this week, including the jackets, but not currently
[26.32 --> 26.80]  right now.
[26.80 --> 31.82]  We have to talk about Microsoft continuing to listen to voice recordings for stuff like
[31.82 --> 32.30]  Cortana.
[32.78 --> 38.12]  We're talking about Facebook opening privacy cafes, like actual physical locations.
[38.28 --> 39.04]  I have an opinion.
[39.26 --> 43.92]  Where they serve you drinks and teach you about your Facebook privacy settings.
[45.62 --> 46.18]  Okay.
[46.46 --> 47.28]  All that and more.
[48.50 --> 49.34]  After the intro.
[49.34 --> 49.62]  We're all in the intro.
[49.76 --> 51.34]  Yeah, only two topics announced.
[51.50 --> 52.70]  I want to swag it.
[55.70 --> 56.54]  Oh boy.
[56.80 --> 59.22]  It's going to be a show.
[59.60 --> 60.24]  It is warm.
[60.34 --> 61.24]  Hey, can you wear this?
[62.10 --> 64.28]  Can you wear this pretty rugged swag it?
[65.12 --> 65.56]  Maybe.
[65.82 --> 66.44]  I'm going to be hot.
[66.48 --> 67.46]  Under studio lights?
[67.68 --> 67.90]  Yeah.
[68.00 --> 68.86]  I'll sweat for this.
[68.94 --> 69.08]  Sweet.
[70.34 --> 71.02]  Wait for it.
[71.14 --> 71.80]  New sponsor.
[71.98 --> 73.10]  Never been seen before.
[73.74 --> 74.32]  Comic Garage.
[74.32 --> 75.22]  Comic Garage?
[75.44 --> 75.84]  Yeah.
[76.30 --> 77.04]  Comic Garage.
[78.78 --> 80.44]  At the privacy cafe.
[81.44 --> 82.30]  Savage Jerky.
[82.30 --> 83.02]  Savage Jerky.
[83.62 --> 84.46]  And Pia.
[84.46 --> 85.06]  Pia.
[86.06 --> 86.46]  Pia.
[87.82 --> 88.64]  Back to the show.
[88.90 --> 89.10]  Okay.
[89.38 --> 93.04]  So, let's talk about our title topic right away.
[93.18 --> 94.46]  Just because I think that makes people happy.
[94.64 --> 98.76]  So, Microsoft continuing their human listening program.
[98.76 --> 104.42]  In recent weeks, reports have emerged that Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, and now Microsoft
[104.42 --> 110.88]  all have audio recordings from their various services reviewed by human contractors to assist
[110.88 --> 113.76]  in the development of virtual assistants slash AI.
[113.92 --> 118.56]  This includes Skype and Cortana, as far as I know, from Microsoft's side.
[118.56 --> 118.72]  Okay.
[119.62 --> 122.90]  Some of these groups, as far as I know, have said, okay, we're going to stop this.
[123.26 --> 124.74]  I believe Apple said that.
[125.38 --> 127.20]  It started with Amazon.
[127.64 --> 128.32]  Started with Amazon.
[128.32 --> 132.54]  It started with Amazon and then Google and then Apple was like, hey, we do that too, but
[132.54 --> 134.64]  we stopped already.
[135.40 --> 135.64]  Oh.
[135.74 --> 136.30]  Nice.
[136.56 --> 137.56]  They tried to get ahead of it.
[137.84 --> 138.02]  Right.
[138.06 --> 138.98]  They tried to get out ahead of it.
[139.06 --> 139.18]  Yeah.
[139.24 --> 139.48]  All right.
[139.48 --> 143.08]  And then I guess Microsoft instead was like, you know what?
[143.58 --> 143.92]  No.
[144.04 --> 144.88]  I'm doubling down.
[145.18 --> 145.94]  We're going to continue.
[146.26 --> 150.58]  We're doing it with the dozens of people who talk to Cortana.
[150.96 --> 151.10]  Yeah.
[151.10 --> 152.92]  I was going to say, no one really uses Cortana.
[153.04 --> 153.48]  I don't know.
[153.62 --> 155.46]  Do you know anyone who uses Cortana?
[155.48 --> 155.70]  No.
[155.70 --> 157.72]  I asked someone on Twitter recently.
[157.86 --> 158.00]  It's like.
[158.64 --> 159.26]  Have you ever tried?
[160.54 --> 165.96]  One time I tried to Google what you can do because they actually have a rare opportunity
[165.96 --> 170.30]  insofar as I would actually love for my PC to.
[170.42 --> 170.74]  Yes.
[170.86 --> 174.14]  To understand if I could do like power user type.
[174.40 --> 174.76]  Yes.
[174.94 --> 175.38]  Tasks.
[175.50 --> 182.82]  Like if I could like tedious things like rename all these pictures, James, and then enumerate
[182.82 --> 184.20]  one, two, three based on date.
[184.32 --> 185.90]  So like if I could do something like that.
[185.90 --> 187.68]  But it's a lot easier to just tell something.
[187.80 --> 191.46]  I could do that tediously by clicking and typing or I could do like a script.
[191.58 --> 191.78]  Yeah.
[191.92 --> 195.04]  But if I could just sit, tell my computer to do that, that'd be wicked.
[195.30 --> 195.66]  Verbally.
[195.66 --> 200.50]  So there are some things you can do in Excel that are kind of like that.
[200.78 --> 202.06]  But I don't think it's like.
[202.68 --> 203.50]  Well, you wouldn't.
[203.54 --> 203.64]  Yeah.
[203.66 --> 207.16]  You wouldn't really be creating any new functionality, but you'd be making it a lot easier.
[207.54 --> 208.00]  Well, that's.
[208.08 --> 209.08]  You'd just be like, hey, you want to.
[209.18 --> 210.60]  Can you do this thing real quick?
[210.68 --> 213.30]  And there's tons of tedious things in Excel that you want to do like that.
[213.30 --> 218.08]  Because there's lots of things in Excel that you can do if you're an Excel wizard and
[218.08 --> 220.04]  you also deal with the Excel quirks.
[220.32 --> 220.54]  Yeah.
[220.76 --> 221.78]  There's tons of quirks.
[221.78 --> 227.92]  I think taking people who know nothing about Excel or programming at all and giving them
[227.92 --> 232.86]  a voice assistant that can do some stuff like, hey, if this number is whatever and this
[232.86 --> 234.20]  number is whatever, let's do this.
[234.28 --> 237.58]  So they're like fairly simple if statements are actually a pretty big block for people
[237.58 --> 239.94]  that have never done that kind of stuff before at all.
[240.24 --> 240.46]  Yeah.
[240.98 --> 243.92]  Especially because they're written a little bit funkily in Excel.
[243.92 --> 247.20]  If you've done programming, you're like, it's no big deal.
[247.36 --> 247.44]  Yeah.
[247.52 --> 247.66]  Yeah.
[247.92 --> 252.92]  But if you haven't touched that stuff before at all, ever, and you're like relatively tech
[252.92 --> 256.80]  illiterate, but you need to do some like weird Excel sheet thing for work and you've
[256.80 --> 257.92]  never done it before and blah, blah, blah, blah.
[258.10 --> 259.88]  If you could just be like, hey, Cortana, do this thing.
[260.00 --> 260.60]  That would be pretty sweet.
[260.62 --> 266.16]  It's funny how with every, it seems like every subject, there's like, it's not linear when
[266.16 --> 266.56]  you're learning.
[267.06 --> 268.58]  There's things that are like S curvy.
[268.58 --> 268.98]  Yeah.
[269.08 --> 273.18]  It's like, if you're learning guitar, once you know bar chords, then you're good to
[273.18 --> 273.34]  go.
[273.42 --> 279.18]  Or like, once you know if statements in Excel, then you can do so much more.
[279.32 --> 279.52]  Yeah.
[279.84 --> 280.24]  Yeah.
[280.68 --> 281.08]  Yeah.
[281.08 --> 283.78]  Because Excel is pretty basic until you start diving into some of those.
[283.88 --> 290.40]  The thing that's weird about this is like, actually, if you are like the odds that, let
[290.40 --> 290.82]  me restart.
[291.02 --> 296.38]  If you're on Amazon, okay, or Google Assistant and you say something to Google Assistant, the
[296.38 --> 301.64]  odds that your recording is the one that one of their employees listens to is so little.
[302.48 --> 304.76]  Because there's so many people using this stuff.
[304.88 --> 307.28]  Like, what are the odds that they actually listen to my recording?
[308.02 --> 308.60]  So few.
[308.84 --> 311.22]  But no one uses Cortana.
[311.40 --> 316.36]  So if you actually use Cortana, the odds that you're one of the people that's getting
[316.36 --> 317.38]  listened to are like way higher.
[317.46 --> 318.32]  It might be 50-50.
[318.84 --> 320.08]  It might be all of them.
[320.58 --> 322.08]  It might be every person.
[322.08 --> 323.88]  It is Cortana and Skype.
[324.76 --> 325.12]  Okay.
[325.24 --> 329.26]  So if they completely mix that pool, then maybe it's not that high.
[329.38 --> 332.64]  Because there are definitely still a pretty big user base as far as I know for Skype.
[332.72 --> 333.00]  For sure.
[333.16 --> 334.92]  Mostly old people as far as I know.
[336.42 --> 338.56]  That is actually an assumption that I have.
[338.74 --> 341.62]  As far as I know, it's more business-y kind of folks that use Skype.
[341.94 --> 346.22]  It was popular there for a little bit in the gaming space, but it was a little annoying
[346.22 --> 346.68]  to use.
[346.84 --> 348.68]  And then Discord showed up and was like, what up?
[348.68 --> 353.48]  There's a concept called excess inertia.
[354.34 --> 354.78]  Yeah.
[354.94 --> 362.64]  Excess inertia in economics where if something, basically it's like you will stay on a platform
[362.64 --> 366.86]  longer than you should and you're suffering because of it, but it's just because it's
[366.86 --> 367.88]  what we all use.
[368.06 --> 368.16]  Yeah.
[368.16 --> 368.70]  Oh, yeah.
[368.70 --> 370.90]  We all should have switched to Google Plus instead of Facebook.
[371.10 --> 372.44]  We know it's better.
[372.52 --> 373.24]  It has better features.
[373.40 --> 375.42]  But there's network effects with social media.
[375.42 --> 378.18]  So we're already on Facebook and my friends are on Facebook.
[378.34 --> 380.82]  But if I go to Google Plus, no one's on it.
[380.84 --> 383.28]  So there's no value then.
[383.44 --> 384.74]  So none of us are switching, right?
[384.88 --> 388.50]  I feel like in the B2B world, that is harder.
[388.52 --> 389.06]  Way more hardcore.
[389.18 --> 390.78]  Like, hey, you work here?
[391.02 --> 393.76]  We've been using GoToMeeting for 10 years.
[393.76 --> 396.04]  So we're still using GoToMeeting.
[396.80 --> 396.94]  Yeah.
[396.94 --> 400.04]  It's like, no one else is using that anymore.
[400.18 --> 403.88]  One of the things I find amazing is when I have calls with relatively big companies that
[403.88 --> 409.18]  have, like, relatively expensive conferencing setups and they just sound like garbage.
[409.84 --> 412.18]  Like, it's really hard to understand anyone.
[412.36 --> 413.58]  It's super crackly.
[413.66 --> 414.30]  It's terrible.
[414.30 --> 419.56]  And I'm like, I use my setup for gaming and it sounds great.
[419.80 --> 423.32]  And I understand there's, like, they're doing with multi-array mics and a bunch of people
[423.32 --> 424.08]  in one room and stuff.
[424.16 --> 425.86]  But still, like, wow.
[426.02 --> 428.82]  That's because gamers are mean to each other.
[429.16 --> 433.92]  And if you start talking, someone on your team will be like, why do you sound like dog
[433.92 --> 434.24]  crap?
[435.28 --> 436.78]  Why is your mic in your throat?
[437.42 --> 438.84]  Whereas that never happens in business.
[438.94 --> 441.12]  It's always like, hey, how are you?
[441.12 --> 445.48]  The worst, though, is when you're on a conference call and if someone, if two people talk at
[445.48 --> 449.48]  the same time at all, if their voices overlap at all, it's just like, no one heard anything.
[449.62 --> 449.80]  Yeah.
[450.94 --> 451.96]  We all have to restart.
[452.22 --> 452.64]  It's all useless.
[454.26 --> 454.70]  Sorry.
[455.12 --> 455.56]  Sorry.
[455.76 --> 456.60]  What was that?
[456.94 --> 457.36]  Anyways.
[457.76 --> 464.08]  The company has updated its privacy policy and FAQs for Cortana and Skype translator.
[464.38 --> 464.68]  Okay.
[464.68 --> 469.98]  To make it clear that audio may be listened to by Microsoft employees or contractors to
[469.98 --> 471.36]  ensure accurate transcription.
[471.50 --> 473.92]  So they're telling you now, but no one's going to read that.
[474.04 --> 474.50]  So not really.
[474.50 --> 474.78]  Yeah, exactly.
[474.92 --> 476.80]  They're basically like, we know that our.
[477.08 --> 478.00]  We did the legal stuff.
[478.32 --> 478.62]  Yeah.
[478.74 --> 479.00]  Whatever.
[479.72 --> 480.48]  I don't.
[480.68 --> 482.12]  I'm not mad at this at all.
[482.12 --> 487.82]  Like the whole, I don't even agree that, that the other companies, Amazon and Apple and Google
[487.82 --> 489.12]  should have even changed.
[489.26 --> 490.64]  Cause it's like, what do you think?
[491.08 --> 493.70]  Like we all want our cake and eat it too.
[493.78 --> 496.28]  Like, do you want the Google assistant to, to understand you?
[496.50 --> 499.12]  Do you want these voice things to like really work well?
[499.30 --> 499.98]  I do.
[501.04 --> 504.28]  I want that to happen now instead of five years from now.
[504.34 --> 507.06]  So can we please just like, yeah, they're listening to you.
[507.06 --> 507.52]  Who cares?
[507.52 --> 511.14]  I feel like it should be a more overt consent thing.
[512.14 --> 514.18]  Like I will throw Microsoft a bone here.
[514.32 --> 518.50]  When you're setting up like windows 10, there's all those little switch settings.
[519.10 --> 521.40]  Like what do I want to share with Microsoft more or less?
[522.10 --> 526.64]  And I think it would probably be better if you could be like, yeah, no, I realized most
[526.64 --> 527.56]  people would say no.
[527.98 --> 530.04]  But the thing with that, I would like that option.
[530.48 --> 532.78]  You're using Microsoft for so many different reasons.
[532.78 --> 538.04]  Whereas like when I buy a Google home, when I buy an Echo, it's like, that's what it's
[538.04 --> 538.40]  for.
[538.76 --> 538.84]  Yeah.
[538.86 --> 543.66]  But it's listening into stuff that it shouldn't like they've in these articles, it's been
[543.66 --> 546.80]  like, oh yeah, we have tons of audio of people banging and whatever else.
[546.94 --> 550.60]  And I don't think someone was like, okay, Google, like, I don't know.
[550.68 --> 551.26]  You know what I mean?
[551.30 --> 551.76]  Oh, sorry.
[551.84 --> 555.94]  But I'm sure everyone just got their, their phones and devices pinged.
[555.94 --> 559.42]  But like, I don't like, there's a lot of false reports.
[559.42 --> 564.04]  The amount of, if I've gone through my like audio log, like all the saved audio recordings
[564.04 --> 566.92]  it has for mine, a huge amount of it is just me driving.
[567.56 --> 567.90]  Okay.
[568.76 --> 570.74]  I'm not intending to talk to my phone.
[571.00 --> 572.80]  There's tons of me just driving.
[572.96 --> 576.82]  One thing you can do is, and which I don't, can you do this in the car?
[577.30 --> 582.14]  One thing you can do is you can make there be a sound when it, when it's listening, when
[582.14 --> 587.46]  you're like, hey, and he goes, now it's listening, it goes, but I have my phone fully muted all
[587.46 --> 587.80]  the time.
[589.12 --> 589.46]  Right.
[589.56 --> 589.96]  Your phone.
[590.04 --> 591.56]  I'm talking about the one on my Google phone.
[591.56 --> 591.78]  Oh yeah.
[591.98 --> 592.26]  Okay.
[592.50 --> 597.44]  It goes, but and then I speak and I also have it on continuous conversation mode.
[597.56 --> 600.68]  So when I'm, if I just have a one line that I want to say to it, which is most of the
[600.68 --> 605.58]  time I go, Hey, but thing I want to say to you, it goes, okay.
[605.58 --> 608.98]  But then it goes, but and listens again and a listen for like eight more seconds.
[608.98 --> 611.88]  And that's usually, I'm not saying anything to it in that time.
[612.14 --> 612.36]  Yeah.
[612.40 --> 616.18]  So that's like almost, that means that almost every time I use it, there's eight seconds
[616.18 --> 618.80]  of it listening to not talking to it, which is a ton.
[619.02 --> 619.24]  Yeah.
[619.48 --> 626.36]  But I know I want to say that they can't like it's data that is useless, but wasn't there
[626.36 --> 631.12]  a, uh, uh, there was like a new site where they actually, I think they heard the recordings
[631.12 --> 635.20]  and then they tried to find the people and they called people up like, Hey, we reached
[635.20 --> 641.66]  you just from listening to the recordings that, that, uh, I'm so brain dead today.
[641.66 --> 642.52]  Whichever company.
[642.66 --> 642.92]  Yeah.
[643.20 --> 643.50]  Yeah.
[643.94 --> 644.62]  You know what I'm saying?
[644.76 --> 644.96]  Yeah.
[646.00 --> 648.46]  But I just, I'm okay with this kind of stuff.
[648.46 --> 651.42]  If it's more overt, I don't want it in the terms of service.
[651.42 --> 652.94]  I want it in your face.
[653.00 --> 654.80]  And if someone's like, yeah, okay, whatever.
[655.04 --> 655.28]  Cool.
[655.92 --> 662.84]  I just think a lot of people for some reason still assume privacy when that, like they
[662.84 --> 666.02]  shouldn't with any of these devices, but they do.
[666.02 --> 669.66]  So they think like, Oh, this recording is just going to some AI and then doing whatever.
[669.66 --> 671.56]  And then there's no human listening and everything's fine.
[672.08 --> 674.06]  Um, but they assume privacy.
[674.06 --> 679.36]  And I think as long as you're like, Hey, not private, that's fine because it's a, it's
[679.36 --> 680.20]  not a government thing.
[680.20 --> 681.30]  It's a company thing.
[681.30 --> 683.32]  You're not obligated to own this thing.
[683.40 --> 684.72]  You could not buy it.
[685.02 --> 689.66]  And, uh, like Apple for instance is going, okay, we're not going to record stuff.
[689.66 --> 691.06]  So you have a competitor.
[691.28 --> 695.12]  It's not like the entire monopoly of all of them is not.
[695.26 --> 698.14]  It's that's the wrong term, but it's not like all of them are doing it now.
[698.56 --> 699.76]  So I don't know.
[700.52 --> 702.08]  I, I don't like it.
[702.18 --> 703.44]  I don't want that to happen.
[703.56 --> 707.70]  I want it to be an opt-in switch, all that kind of stuff, but they can do whatever they
[707.70 --> 707.98]  want.
[708.10 --> 712.40]  Like if you want to have one of these products and then also be as private as possible,
[712.40 --> 715.32]  like those two things at the same time, they don't combine very well.
[715.32 --> 722.10]  No, you have to, you have to say like, okay, don't talk about like your address or your,
[722.10 --> 725.40]  your social insurance number around this device.
[725.56 --> 725.80]  Yeah.
[726.22 --> 727.32]  Or that's your phone.
[727.44 --> 731.48]  So like you're probably screwed.
[732.18 --> 733.68]  Uh, you can turn it off on the phone.
[734.42 --> 736.86]  Like the, the fact that being able to hail it with it.
[737.20 --> 737.44]  Yeah.
[737.44 --> 743.98]  Mine, mine only goes from, or it's only supposed to, but I think it got reset somehow only goes
[743.98 --> 747.02]  from holding the home button, but I think it, I think it activates.
[747.16 --> 748.46]  It didn't activate when I just said it.
[748.58 --> 750.38]  So maybe I made it some weird phrase or something.
[750.44 --> 750.78]  I don't know.
[751.20 --> 754.40]  Uh, but I don't really use the voice activation stuff personally.
[754.56 --> 755.02]  I love it.
[755.44 --> 755.72]  Yeah.
[756.02 --> 756.44]  I love it.
[756.50 --> 759.54]  I liked it for a while, but I don't think it's good enough.
[760.36 --> 763.26]  I want it to be like, boom.
[763.38 --> 769.08]  I want it to be like, uh, uh, if you want it to be good, they need to, they need.
[769.08 --> 769.74]  No, I use it.
[769.94 --> 770.22]  Okay.
[770.22 --> 770.74]  Yeah.
[771.12 --> 774.10]  I use it a lot, but I just do it manually.
[774.52 --> 774.88]  Yeah.
[774.94 --> 776.68]  Well, they used to have, what do you mean?
[777.06 --> 777.22]  Yeah.
[777.30 --> 777.42]  Yeah.
[777.60 --> 781.66]  No, but they were still using that, those voice clips of when you do it manually and then the
[781.66 --> 782.54]  humans are listening to that.
[782.68 --> 782.88]  Yeah.
[783.14 --> 783.82]  That's fine.
[784.26 --> 787.00]  They can listen to me set a million alarms.
[787.14 --> 789.48]  That's like basically what I use it for entirely.
[789.86 --> 790.00]  Yeah.
[790.08 --> 791.88]  Um, I don't have any home automation stuff or anything.
[791.88 --> 797.02]  So I just like set an alarm for blit set a reminder for blit and all my reminders.
[797.02 --> 798.92]  Like it doesn't understand what I'm saying at all.
[799.00 --> 802.70]  So it's just like complete garbly gook that I have to translate on the other end.
[802.98 --> 803.86]  It's just, yeah.
[803.86 --> 806.36]  I want like, um, what was that movie?
[806.60 --> 807.26]  Is it called her?
[808.00 --> 808.40]  Yeah.
[809.08 --> 812.02]  The like super AI thing that you form a relationship.
[812.14 --> 813.52]  I want that level of AI.
[813.62 --> 814.10]  That's the best.
[814.20 --> 814.32]  Yeah.
[814.48 --> 815.60]  Then I'm, I'm in.
[815.84 --> 816.90]  Everyone's in with that one.
[816.90 --> 817.60]  I want a bro.
[817.60 --> 818.90]  I want a pocket bro.
[819.00 --> 819.20]  Him.
[819.38 --> 819.56]  Yeah.
[819.84 --> 820.02]  Yeah.
[820.02 --> 820.74]  Yeah, exactly.
[820.98 --> 821.10]  Yeah.
[823.16 --> 825.16]  Oh, that's fantastic.
[825.16 --> 826.50]  I loved them.
[826.62 --> 828.36]  I thought the ending was a little bit of a cop out.
[829.50 --> 830.30]  I liked it.
[830.34 --> 831.04]  I liked it.
[831.28 --> 831.56]  Okay.
[831.62 --> 832.52]  We don't want to spoil it.
[832.52 --> 832.56]  Yeah.
[832.64 --> 832.90]  Let's not.
[832.96 --> 834.20]  I mean, the movie is five years old.
[834.28 --> 834.94]  You guys should check it out.
[834.94 --> 835.10]  Yeah.
[835.10 --> 835.34]  Whatever.
[835.66 --> 836.58]  I thought it was realistic.
[836.78 --> 837.46]  We should move on.
[837.60 --> 838.38]  You've got comments.
[839.10 --> 841.30]  Facebook to open up pop up privacy cafes.
[842.38 --> 844.96]  This just, I just, this just sounds hilarious to me.
[845.02 --> 846.28]  Like, I don't really even know what to do.
[846.28 --> 847.30]  This is such a waste of money.
[847.30 --> 847.82]  You guys.
[849.02 --> 849.84]  You already lost.
[849.84 --> 850.62]  They just have so much.
[850.62 --> 857.64]  Oh, they had to spend 20% of their annual revenue on, on a fine from the EU this year.
[857.88 --> 860.80]  So it's like, you don't have that much money.
[861.34 --> 862.82]  Like, this is costing you millions.
[863.54 --> 867.78]  We're going to set up these little cafes that people will go to and we'll give them free drinks in there.
[868.06 --> 873.70]  And then we'll teach them how to, we'll teach them about our current privacy rules.
[873.76 --> 877.18]  Instead of adjusting our rules ourselves, it's not our fault.
[877.40 --> 879.18]  We actually have the optimal rules.
[879.18 --> 882.98]  We leaked all your passwords in plain text, but you should change your privacy settings.
[883.50 --> 883.62]  Yeah.
[883.68 --> 885.90]  You guys should just understand more what you're sharing with us.
[885.96 --> 886.84]  It's a you problem.
[887.16 --> 887.30]  Yeah.
[887.78 --> 888.46]  That's brutal.
[889.06 --> 890.30]  Who's going to go to these?
[891.22 --> 891.80]  No one.
[891.90 --> 894.40]  And furthermore, they shouldn't be cafes.
[894.70 --> 896.32]  They shouldn't be like a Starbucks that you go to.
[896.56 --> 898.24]  It should actually be like lawn bowling.
[899.02 --> 899.50]  Yeah.
[900.50 --> 902.48]  They need to set up something that attracts old people.
[902.48 --> 903.48]  Yeah.
[903.72 --> 911.20]  Well, I was going to say, I feel like it's going to be old people and like vloggers who are going to be like, I went to the Facebook cafe because that's hilarious.
[911.58 --> 913.44]  I think it's going to be people who want free Wi-Fi.
[914.60 --> 916.06]  It's going to be like, I don't have to buy anything.
[916.34 --> 917.56]  I can hang out in here all day.
[917.86 --> 918.26]  And Starbucks.
[918.76 --> 919.02]  Yeah.
[919.02 --> 924.42]  Starbucks is amazing when you're traveling because they're everywhere.
[924.74 --> 925.96]  They all have free Wi-Fi.
[926.08 --> 927.70]  And they have air conditioning when you're in like Asia.
[927.96 --> 928.06]  Yeah.
[928.06 --> 928.52]  You're like, ugh.
[930.26 --> 931.82]  I don't drink coffee.
[932.20 --> 933.64]  Love Starbucks when I'm traveling.
[933.96 --> 938.66]  The other week I was just walking down in North Vancouver, just downtown, really had to pee.
[938.74 --> 940.22]  I was about to get in my car and drive for a bit.
[940.22 --> 941.26]  I saw a Starbucks.
[941.34 --> 943.64]  I was like, I can pee in there without talking to anyone.
[943.92 --> 944.06]  Yeah.
[944.70 --> 945.38]  Free bathroom.
[946.92 --> 948.20]  Thanks, angry people in America.
[948.20 --> 954.20]  It's a form of privilege because homeless people, they just, they walk in and then the people working are like, no.
[954.66 --> 956.84]  Well, no, they don't do that anymore or whatever.
[957.14 --> 957.44]  Where?
[958.04 --> 958.82]  In Starbucks?
[958.82 --> 964.32]  There was this huge thing in the States because they said no to someone and then that person freaked out.
[965.54 --> 970.40]  And Starbucks had like sensitivity training workshops for their people and all this kind of stuff.
[971.72 --> 977.38]  Maybe for Starbucks in particular, but there's lots of different establishments that have, like they've got locks on the.
[977.38 --> 978.22]  Yeah.
[978.22 --> 979.02]  On the door.
[979.14 --> 979.22]  Yeah.
[979.22 --> 983.18]  And like you have to get a code and to get the code, you have to talk to the person working there and they'll just like say no.
[983.18 --> 985.30]  Or the stick with the key on it or whatever.
[985.56 --> 985.76]  Yeah.
[986.28 --> 987.62]  I think that's worth a gas station thing.
[988.72 --> 989.12]  Subway.
[989.22 --> 989.40]  Yeah.
[989.64 --> 990.30]  Subway over here.
[990.30 --> 990.80]  There we go.
[991.04 --> 992.44]  I love when it's just huge.
[992.64 --> 993.82]  It's kind of embarrassing to me.
[994.08 --> 994.26]  Yeah.
[994.72 --> 995.16]  Walking around.
[995.16 --> 996.54]  I need to pee.
[996.64 --> 997.24]  Hey, everyone.
[997.48 --> 998.64]  I'm going to go touch my pee pee.
[1000.12 --> 1004.90]  I promise it won't be for too long, but probably more than three shakes because that's just a meme.
[1006.58 --> 1007.02]  Yeah.
[1007.08 --> 1007.46]  I don't know.
[1007.62 --> 1009.52]  I just find this funny.
[1010.56 --> 1014.30]  Like the last note in the doc is seems they still don't freaking get it.
[1014.54 --> 1015.06]  And yeah.
[1016.10 --> 1016.40]  Yeah.
[1016.70 --> 1017.96]  I think that's pretty accurate.
[1018.16 --> 1019.58]  Do you think no one's going to go?
[1019.58 --> 1020.10]  I find it hilarious though.
[1020.28 --> 1020.94]  No, people will go.
[1021.20 --> 1022.16]  People will absolutely go.
[1023.26 --> 1023.92]  Oh my God.
[1023.92 --> 1027.14]  Because like I wouldn't be surprised if the drinks were free.
[1028.48 --> 1029.02]  They are.
[1029.36 --> 1029.62]  Yeah.
[1029.72 --> 1029.94]  They are.
[1030.12 --> 1030.92]  So people are going to go.
[1031.64 --> 1032.50]  It's free coffee.
[1032.62 --> 1035.74]  Do you think maybe it'll work?
[1036.26 --> 1041.00]  Maybe if you there's like a critical mass when you get enough people like this is only London,
[1041.14 --> 1044.38]  but maybe if you get enough people who really understand how it works,
[1044.38 --> 1048.34]  then eventually you'll have like a culture where like those people are talking online
[1048.34 --> 1052.80]  and they kind of just spread around and then we just all kind of get it eventually.
[1053.26 --> 1053.60]  Sure.
[1054.24 --> 1055.90]  You know, it doesn't have with monkeys or something.
[1056.22 --> 1060.08]  But doesn't Facebook reset your privacy settings every time they release new privacy settings?
[1060.82 --> 1063.30]  Oh, I don't remember.
[1063.44 --> 1065.34]  That could be a complete hearsay thing.
[1065.40 --> 1066.42]  Do not take that as fact.
[1067.66 --> 1068.56]  But I don't know.
[1068.68 --> 1069.22]  Either way.
[1069.34 --> 1069.60]  Yeah.
[1069.68 --> 1070.88]  Check your Facebook privacy settings.
[1070.88 --> 1072.10]  Also, pro tip.
[1072.62 --> 1073.86]  Don't post anything on Facebook.
[1074.74 --> 1075.46]  It's great.
[1075.72 --> 1080.28]  There's add-ons for Chrome and I believe Firefox that completely get rid of your news feed.
[1080.60 --> 1081.64]  And they just put a quote there.
[1081.94 --> 1086.16]  And if you have to have Facebook for communicating with family through the messenger portion,
[1086.38 --> 1087.68]  you can still use that.
[1087.74 --> 1090.52]  Or if you have like a family group thing, you can still use that.
[1090.60 --> 1092.46]  But your news feed, probably useless.
[1092.72 --> 1094.20]  So just get rid of it.
[1095.14 --> 1096.36]  That sounds awesome.
[1096.54 --> 1097.12]  Problem solved.
[1097.94 --> 1099.44]  It's on my phone though.
[1099.44 --> 1100.44]  Yeah.
[1101.94 --> 1103.62]  I just immediately go to the groups thing.
[1104.50 --> 1107.62]  I actually don't use Facebook on my phone, how do I think about it.
[1107.70 --> 1108.76]  I just use the messenger part.
[1109.14 --> 1109.92]  I used to do that.
[1110.66 --> 1111.98]  But now I can't for reasons.
[1112.44 --> 1112.58]  Ah.
[1112.92 --> 1113.14]  Yeah.
[1113.46 --> 1113.64]  Yeah.
[1114.08 --> 1114.48]  Pages.
[1115.04 --> 1115.86]  Like there's a comedy.
[1116.02 --> 1117.96]  There's a Vancouver stand-up comedy thing.
[1118.18 --> 1118.28]  It's very active.
[1118.28 --> 1119.54]  See, but you don't use the feed.
[1119.78 --> 1122.32]  So I guess on your phone, there's probably no way to get rid of it.
[1122.32 --> 1124.68]  But just bypass, go directly to the group.
[1125.14 --> 1125.26]  Yeah.
[1125.26 --> 1126.40]  Completely ignore the feed.
[1126.42 --> 1127.34]  Just don't eat junk food.
[1127.48 --> 1127.66]  Yeah.
[1129.68 --> 1130.60]  Just say no.
[1132.22 --> 1133.64]  It's harder than you'd think.
[1134.74 --> 1137.90]  YouTube allows creators to record videos to appeal demonetization.
[1138.04 --> 1138.80]  This is actually.
[1139.04 --> 1139.54]  I love this.
[1139.82 --> 1140.22]  Amazing.
[1140.58 --> 1141.04]  I love this.
[1141.04 --> 1141.50]  This is super cool.
[1141.50 --> 1143.34]  When I first read it, I was like, that's weird.
[1143.48 --> 1144.50]  But no, I'm totally down.
[1145.58 --> 1146.66]  Let's see if this will load.
[1147.50 --> 1148.34]  From Ziverge.
[1148.34 --> 1153.24]  This has nothing cool on it.
[1153.34 --> 1153.54]  Okay.
[1153.68 --> 1154.62]  We're going to go back to here.
[1157.02 --> 1157.42]  Yeah.
[1157.48 --> 1161.64]  So currently, if a YouTube content creator has their channel slash video demonetized,
[1161.84 --> 1165.92]  the only option for appealing decision is to fill out a form and wait like 30 days.
[1166.28 --> 1170.44]  Now, YouTube is doing a pilot program which would allow creators to create a video,
[1170.44 --> 1175.96]  the thing that they do and are probably a lot better at than just writing appeals,
[1175.96 --> 1179.06]  about why they shouldn't be demonetized.
[1179.16 --> 1181.10]  YouTube will reportedly respond within seven days.
[1181.30 --> 1182.36]  I think this will be a lot better.
[1182.60 --> 1186.80]  I think YouTube creators are going to be a lot more efficient and better at conveying
[1186.80 --> 1187.80]  themselves over video.
[1187.96 --> 1194.30]  And you will also be able to, I think understanding someone, the understanding of something that
[1194.30 --> 1200.14]  someone is saying improves when they're saying it to you, whether it's in person or through
[1200.14 --> 1200.46]  video.
[1200.64 --> 1200.88]  Sure.
[1200.88 --> 1201.82]  In person even more so.
[1202.06 --> 1204.02]  But video definitely as well.
[1204.02 --> 1208.54]  You know you're talking to a real person and you know that like, you know that they can
[1208.54 --> 1208.86]  talk.
[1208.96 --> 1210.12]  They have a channel.
[1210.46 --> 1210.60]  Yeah.
[1210.60 --> 1213.28]  You don't know how good their writing skills are.
[1213.50 --> 1214.10]  So it's kind of.
[1214.48 --> 1216.70]  And there's body language cues and all this other kind of stuff.
[1216.76 --> 1216.86]  Yeah.
[1216.92 --> 1219.86]  If they don't want to show up on camera, it's still probably beneficial because they can
[1219.86 --> 1221.50]  show what they're talking about.
[1221.82 --> 1225.62]  So if they show their video and they scroll through the part and they explain like why it
[1225.62 --> 1228.46]  doesn't matter, that's going to be more effective as well.
[1228.54 --> 1230.18]  I just think it's way better overall.
[1230.18 --> 1235.66]  The program was described in an email sent to a creator and posted on r slash YouTube.
[1236.76 --> 1237.28]  Creators are.
[1237.50 --> 1237.84]  Why?
[1238.22 --> 1238.40]  Okay.
[1238.60 --> 1238.88]  Normally.
[1239.10 --> 1239.96]  I think this is so awesome.
[1240.12 --> 1242.40]  I wish that more things would do this.
[1242.52 --> 1246.58]  Like, you know when you get a speeding ticket or some kind of ticket and you want to dispute
[1246.58 --> 1249.42]  it and you have to like go to court and like miss work so you can go to court and then
[1249.42 --> 1253.24]  show up and the cop has to show up and everyone has to, there's a bunch of people in the room.
[1253.76 --> 1255.00]  Can I, can they just call me?
[1255.00 --> 1257.72]  Can I just FaceTime them and be like, look, I wasn't speeding.
[1257.90 --> 1258.08]  Okay.
[1259.18 --> 1261.82]  There was a bee in there or whatever it is.
[1262.02 --> 1267.42]  Like it would be so much faster if the judge could just be on, just eating popcorn and just
[1267.42 --> 1267.88]  Hey.
[1268.16 --> 1268.72]  Hey, what up?
[1268.86 --> 1269.12]  Yeah.
[1269.74 --> 1271.04]  It doesn't matter if it's a bee in there.
[1271.06 --> 1271.76]  You're still sped, dude.
[1271.92 --> 1272.58]  It's like, okay.
[1274.08 --> 1275.38]  You can do that on my lunch break, you know?
[1275.82 --> 1276.12]  Yeah.
[1276.58 --> 1277.42]  Like Estonia.
[1278.42 --> 1280.54]  They do all their government stuff through the internet.
[1280.76 --> 1281.10]  It's crazy.
[1281.10 --> 1283.76]  People seem to like this new system.
[1283.86 --> 1284.10]  Yeah.
[1284.42 --> 1285.02]  So do we.
[1285.18 --> 1285.68]  That's cool.
[1285.92 --> 1286.82]  This makes tons of sense.
[1287.00 --> 1287.82]  I like it.
[1287.98 --> 1288.32]  It's great.
[1288.90 --> 1289.26]  Fantastic.
[1289.68 --> 1291.38]  They also say the wait time should be lower.
[1291.78 --> 1294.42]  They say they'll be responding within seven days instead of 30.
[1294.50 --> 1295.70]  That's weird to me.
[1296.60 --> 1298.06]  Well, they're just trying harder overall.
[1298.32 --> 1300.26]  But yeah, maybe they're just pushing.
[1300.74 --> 1301.20]  That's cool.
[1301.60 --> 1303.82]  I appreciate that because this has been pissing people off for a long time.
[1304.02 --> 1304.54]  Actually, no.
[1304.74 --> 1305.52]  Don't do it, YouTube.
[1306.10 --> 1308.62]  Ah, the more you screw up, the more people want to join Floatplane.
[1308.78 --> 1309.26]  Ha ha ha.
[1309.26 --> 1311.26]  Ha ha ha.
[1312.02 --> 1312.50]  Darn.
[1313.20 --> 1316.98]  Anyways, Amazon sold gas for 30 cents and the police had to intervene.
[1317.42 --> 1324.18]  So Maysell, Maysell Day, I don't know, is Amazon's latest marketing campaign for the
[1324.18 --> 1327.00]  Prime Video series, The Marvelous Mrs.
[1328.40 --> 1328.76]  Maysell.
[1328.86 --> 1329.20]  Maysell?
[1329.48 --> 1329.98]  I suppose.
[1330.16 --> 1331.14]  I've never seen this show.
[1331.36 --> 1332.02]  Apparently it's...
[1332.02 --> 1332.38]  Me neither.
[1332.98 --> 1334.26]  There's been more than one season.
[1334.38 --> 1335.04]  Have I told you...
[1335.04 --> 1338.32]  They sent me a physical piece of mail telling me to use Prime Video.
[1338.32 --> 1339.00]  Amazon did.
[1339.26 --> 1339.66]  Oh, yeah.
[1339.78 --> 1343.42]  Because I've had a Prime account for forever and I've never once opened Amazon Prime Video.
[1343.52 --> 1343.70]  Oh.
[1343.96 --> 1344.84]  I don't really watch shows.
[1345.00 --> 1345.44]  It's just...
[1345.44 --> 1346.32]  I don't...
[1346.32 --> 1346.86]  I don't care.
[1347.20 --> 1347.82]  Was it...
[1347.82 --> 1348.52]  What was it like?
[1348.60 --> 1348.78]  Was it...
[1348.78 --> 1349.24]  It just...
[1349.24 --> 1353.12]  It was like, by the way, you have access to tons of amazing content.
[1353.22 --> 1353.52]  Blah, blah, blah.
[1353.58 --> 1356.66]  And then you flip it over and there's a bunch of like descriptions of the shows and stuff.
[1356.70 --> 1358.02]  And I was like, wow, this is weird.
[1358.42 --> 1358.70]  Hmm.
[1358.80 --> 1359.08]  Okay.
[1359.24 --> 1360.58]  I'm not going to cancel my Prime account.
[1360.64 --> 1361.40]  You don't have to worry about it.
[1361.46 --> 1364.06]  Don't send me physical mail about the thing that I don't care about.
[1364.10 --> 1364.44]  Thank you.
[1364.70 --> 1364.96]  Goodbye.
[1365.96 --> 1367.30]  I want to watch The Boys though.
[1367.86 --> 1368.16]  Okay.
[1368.22 --> 1369.28]  I might actually watch The Boys.
[1369.28 --> 1371.94]  I know nothing about it, but everyone's like, hey, have you seen the show yet?
[1372.10 --> 1374.72]  I just listen to Brandon and Brandon's like, hey, have you watched The Boys?
[1374.92 --> 1375.96]  Don't listen to Brandon.
[1376.02 --> 1376.46]  Hey, Brandon.
[1376.68 --> 1377.18]  Can you hear me?
[1378.18 --> 1379.64]  Brandon likes that stupid...
[1379.64 --> 1380.18]  He's not there.
[1380.36 --> 1380.72]  Okay.
[1381.10 --> 1381.54]  What show?
[1381.66 --> 1381.98]  What show?
[1381.98 --> 1382.44]  I want to know.
[1382.56 --> 1383.78]  I want the inside dig.
[1384.86 --> 1385.56]  What's it called?
[1385.70 --> 1386.10]  Oaksha?
[1386.98 --> 1388.30]  That show about...
[1388.30 --> 1389.18]  There's this director.
[1389.18 --> 1392.42]  He also did that movie where they're all on a train.
[1392.98 --> 1393.88]  It's post-apocalyptic.
[1394.56 --> 1396.12]  I'm too brain dead today to...
[1396.12 --> 1397.72]  A train and it's post-apocalyptic.
[1397.72 --> 1399.38]  Good God.
[1399.44 --> 1399.92]  What was that called?
[1400.02 --> 1401.26]  Oh, it was all wintry on the earth.
[1401.50 --> 1402.00]  What was that called?
[1402.06 --> 1402.56]  Snowpiercer.
[1402.82 --> 1403.44]  Something piercer.
[1403.74 --> 1404.16]  Oh.
[1404.58 --> 1405.24]  I hate that director.
[1405.32 --> 1405.60]  I hate him.
[1406.54 --> 1407.20]  I hate his guts.
[1408.60 --> 1412.88]  And he had a previous movie that's about like this weird fantastical animal.
[1413.00 --> 1415.04]  It's kind of an animal rights movie, which I'm into.
[1416.62 --> 1417.66]  Brandon loves this movie.
[1417.96 --> 1419.40]  I thought it was hot garbage.
[1419.98 --> 1421.34]  I love Jake Gyllenhaal.
[1421.42 --> 1423.16]  Jake Gyllenhaal like hurt me in that movie.
[1423.54 --> 1424.76]  And like we argue about it.
[1424.84 --> 1425.40]  It's like our...
[1425.40 --> 1427.66]  I can bring it up at any time if I ever want...
[1427.66 --> 1431.32]  Like if I was ever trying to distract Brandon, like if you were trying to sneak by him and
[1431.32 --> 1435.16]  he was right there and there was just no way you can get by him, if I just like walked
[1435.16 --> 1438.06]  up and said, hey dude, that movie sucks, you would be able to sneak by him.
[1438.14 --> 1438.36]  Oh yeah.
[1438.40 --> 1440.62]  You could just push a big cart with cake on it right by him.
[1440.68 --> 1440.94]  Oh yeah.
[1441.04 --> 1441.42]  You wouldn't see it.
[1441.42 --> 1441.92]  You'd have no idea.
[1441.92 --> 1444.54]  Anyways, I have no freaking clue what this is.
[1444.54 --> 1451.88]  But they did a promotional thing for it where in Santa Monica, they rolled back everything
[1451.88 --> 1457.62]  to the prices that it would have been in 1959, including 30 cents per gallon gas.
[1457.86 --> 1458.38]  And hot dogs.
[1458.94 --> 1459.94]  And hot dogs.
[1460.66 --> 1462.30]  And 51 cent movie tickets.
[1462.70 --> 1468.14]  Hotel rooms, movie tickets, milkshakes and more were all reset back to 1959.
[1468.14 --> 1469.82]  That's awesome.
[1469.82 --> 1475.06]  This caused a massive traffic disruption as tons of eager customers were like, give me
[1475.06 --> 1476.66]  some of that 30 cent gas.
[1476.74 --> 1476.88]  Yeah.
[1476.88 --> 1479.12]  And the police had to intervene and like shut it down for a bit.
[1479.20 --> 1482.70]  But then they got it going again with more organization.
[1482.98 --> 1483.24]  Yeah.
[1483.24 --> 1486.50]  So Amazon intervened and was like, no, we want this marketing thing to go by.
[1486.58 --> 1488.78]  We want to pay for a huge chunk of everyone's gas.
[1489.12 --> 1492.54]  So they just limited the amount of people, the amount of cars that could be in line.
[1492.90 --> 1497.44]  Gas is really interesting because there's no real like one per customer with gas.
[1497.44 --> 1502.34]  Someone could have went up with a pickup truck full of jerry cans and just been like, that
[1502.34 --> 1502.66]  one.
[1503.16 --> 1503.34]  Yeah.
[1503.42 --> 1504.00]  That one.
[1504.14 --> 1504.32]  Yeah.
[1504.40 --> 1504.96]  Just all day.
[1505.16 --> 1505.34]  Yeah.
[1506.12 --> 1509.36]  Like we're talking like an order of magnitude less money.
[1509.60 --> 1510.96]  Like that's awesome.
[1511.32 --> 1511.46]  Yeah.
[1511.72 --> 1516.02]  Gas does expire, but you're also very likely going to use it before it does expire.
[1516.12 --> 1519.00]  And you could just resell it to your friends.
[1519.50 --> 1519.92]  Oh, yeah.
[1520.00 --> 1521.44]  Not like widely.
[1522.22 --> 1523.22]  It probably wouldn't go that well.
[1523.28 --> 1524.26]  But to your friends, you could absolutely.
[1524.26 --> 1524.58]  Definitely.
[1524.58 --> 1527.76]  Here's a jerry can for twice as much as I paid and half as much as what you would be
[1527.76 --> 1528.02]  paying.
[1528.46 --> 1531.24]  Or you could always like symbolically burn something down.
[1531.54 --> 1532.32]  You know, cleansing.
[1532.32 --> 1532.66]  There you go.
[1532.76 --> 1533.06]  Perfect.
[1533.48 --> 1533.64]  Yeah.
[1535.54 --> 1535.84]  That seems reasonable.
[1535.84 --> 1536.22]  Hey, Brandon.
[1536.94 --> 1538.54]  What's that movie you like that I hate?
[1538.94 --> 1539.30]  Oakjaw.
[1539.50 --> 1540.08]  Yeah, Oakjaw.
[1540.24 --> 1540.56]  Oakjaw?
[1540.66 --> 1541.74]  I've never heard of this.
[1541.74 --> 1542.00]  All right.
[1542.08 --> 1543.56]  I'm happy for you.
[1543.86 --> 1545.56]  Stay that way.
[1546.14 --> 1546.44]  Okay.
[1546.58 --> 1547.68]  James can be growing wrong.
[1547.76 --> 1548.56]  Don't waste your time, dude.
[1548.56 --> 1549.52]  I need both of you.
[1549.54 --> 1550.50]  I'm wrong that it's a bad movie.
[1550.54 --> 1552.02]  I need both of you to watch it with me.
[1552.02 --> 1552.50]  Okay, how about this?
[1552.50 --> 1554.12]  So I can hear the commentary on each side.
[1554.14 --> 1555.32]  I'm sure the chat's going crazier.
[1555.66 --> 1556.66]  They're crazy about it.
[1557.62 --> 1560.60]  If people super chat about it, whoever...
[1560.60 --> 1561.96]  This is too cringe.
[1562.28 --> 1566.08]  I was going to say, if there's two super chats about it, whoever super chatted the most,
[1566.44 --> 1567.34]  that's who's right.
[1567.78 --> 1568.06]  Wow.
[1568.30 --> 1568.86]  Come on.
[1568.86 --> 1569.20]  Wow.
[1569.20 --> 1570.26]  And it settles it forever.
[1570.26 --> 1570.60]  What?
[1570.74 --> 1571.56]  It settles it forever.
[1571.68 --> 1575.94]  So if someone super chats a dollar and says that Brandon's right versus someone with buck
[1575.94 --> 1577.58]  50, I'm right, then it's...
[1577.58 --> 1579.66]  I see you just going on your phone in a second.
[1581.52 --> 1581.96]  Done.
[1582.10 --> 1582.74]  I win this argument.
[1582.86 --> 1583.36]  My alias.
[1583.94 --> 1584.62]  Moving on.
[1586.04 --> 1586.40]  Huawei.
[1586.94 --> 1587.06]  Sponsors?
[1587.06 --> 1587.90]  Folding phone gets...
[1587.90 --> 1588.50]  Ah, yes.
[1588.62 --> 1588.90]  Sponsors.
[1588.92 --> 1589.36]  Never mind.
[1589.74 --> 1590.36]  Not Huawei.
[1590.78 --> 1593.66]  Not Huawei helping African governments do crazy things.
[1594.00 --> 1595.14]  We're going to talk about sponsors.
[1595.76 --> 1597.22]  First of which is the new one.
[1597.48 --> 1598.48]  The Comet Garage.
[1598.86 --> 1599.52]  What is this?
[1599.56 --> 1600.58]  I'm going to give you these.
[1600.58 --> 1604.16]  This looks like the kind of emblem that could be on my superhero suit chest.
[1604.26 --> 1605.20]  Well, I read things.
[1605.30 --> 1605.84]  You get those.
[1606.46 --> 1609.04]  The Comet Garage is a monthly comic box service.
[1609.20 --> 1610.24]  Comic book box service.
[1610.70 --> 1615.92]  You choose your favorite characters and the Comet Garage curates a personalized box around
[1615.92 --> 1616.58]  your selections.
[1616.72 --> 1617.40]  Receive 10...
[1617.40 --> 1617.82]  Oh, really?
[1618.18 --> 1618.46]  Yeah.
[1618.62 --> 1619.62]  That's actually pretty sweet.
[1619.68 --> 1620.18]  I didn't know that.
[1620.42 --> 1623.68]  Receive 10 curated comments in their monthly super box.
[1623.80 --> 1624.26]  Every month?
[1624.44 --> 1624.70]  10?
[1624.70 --> 1624.76]  10?
[1625.10 --> 1630.00]  Or 24 curated comics in their ultimate box, which is this one.
[1630.58 --> 1632.46]  That's actually pretty epic.
[1632.68 --> 1636.26]  You can even purchase a character-only box if you prefer.
[1636.78 --> 1638.08]  We got Christian Bale Batman.
[1638.96 --> 1639.18]  Oh, wait.
[1639.26 --> 1639.62]  I'm holding it.
[1639.62 --> 1639.82]  Dang.
[1640.12 --> 1641.22]  This is Aquaman, dude.
[1641.52 --> 1643.12]  Yeah, but we got Batman on the back, though.
[1643.96 --> 1645.16]  Dude, Aquaman is...
[1645.16 --> 1646.36]  Okay, I'm going to do...
[1646.36 --> 1648.42]  How about we do wrong names for everybody?
[1648.62 --> 1649.72]  We got Long Neck Guy.
[1650.52 --> 1651.00]  Waterboy.
[1652.40 --> 1653.12]  We got...
[1654.20 --> 1657.74]  Bent Over the Wrong Way Person.
[1658.46 --> 1659.80]  That's the wrong way to...
[1659.80 --> 1660.22]  Is she getting shanked?
[1660.22 --> 1661.02]  Oh, jeez.
[1661.02 --> 1661.60]  That's what I'm saying.
[1661.74 --> 1662.24]  She's dead.
[1662.94 --> 1663.52]  She's gone.
[1664.42 --> 1664.92]  That's it.
[1664.92 --> 1665.04]  Oh, my God.
[1665.12 --> 1666.12]  This is legit.
[1666.30 --> 1667.06]  Let me open this one.
[1667.90 --> 1668.40]  Super box.
[1668.48 --> 1669.08]  10 comics.
[1669.28 --> 1670.26]  Am I supposed to open this one?
[1670.40 --> 1670.76]  I don't know.
[1671.30 --> 1672.60]  Do we have to keep these here?
[1672.60 --> 1673.32]  Can I bring this home?
[1674.40 --> 1674.92]  Uh...
[1674.92 --> 1676.54]  I mean, I'm not going to show anyone.
[1677.74 --> 1678.68]  You can do whatever you want.
[1678.68 --> 1679.20]  Uh...
[1679.20 --> 1680.50]  See, this is a lot of comics for a month.
[1680.50 --> 1681.12]  Do you have comics?
[1681.12 --> 1682.08]  I have comics.
[1682.52 --> 1683.26]  I like comics.
[1683.26 --> 1690.72]  I really like Marvel lore and superhero stuff, but I didn't have them as a kid.
[1690.96 --> 1692.78]  My cousin did, and he taught me everything.
[1693.06 --> 1698.30]  And then I did all the animated series, and also just, like, read the lore online.
[1698.30 --> 1702.80]  But I don't actually have much experience with comic books themselves.
[1702.94 --> 1706.12]  I will also say, both of these boxes were surprisingly rigid.
[1706.32 --> 1712.98]  It is just cardboard, but it's relatively decent cardboard, and there's an inside sheath thing.
[1713.42 --> 1714.32]  I don't really know how to...
[1714.32 --> 1717.64]  So there's the outside cardboard, and then there's inside sheath, and then...
[1717.64 --> 1719.42]  What do you have to type in to get this?
[1720.72 --> 1721.24]  M&M's.
[1721.24 --> 1721.88]  M&M's.
[1723.48 --> 1725.26]  Type in awesome superheroes?
[1725.26 --> 1727.70]  I want to read that one.
[1727.70 --> 1728.60]  Oh, no, that's the back.
[1728.66 --> 1729.24]  It's Spider-Woman.
[1729.42 --> 1730.06]  It's Spider-Woman.
[1730.16 --> 1730.28]  Okay.
[1730.58 --> 1732.58]  I want to read an M&M superhero comic now.
[1733.06 --> 1739.56]  And then, inside the package, it's wrapped in this plastic stuff, which probably sounds terrible
[1739.56 --> 1740.04]  through the mic.
[1740.10 --> 1740.48]  I'm sorry.
[1741.06 --> 1747.22]  And then, on top of that, well, I guess, around that, I guess, they have little shields.
[1748.26 --> 1750.90]  Superhero shield thingies that protect your comics again.
[1751.48 --> 1752.88]  So they're looking out for your stuff.
[1752.90 --> 1753.50]  How much is this?
[1753.78 --> 1754.26]  I don't know.
[1754.26 --> 1755.80]  It doesn't actually say.
[1756.18 --> 1756.70]  This is a lot.
[1756.70 --> 1757.20]  Oh, it does.
[1757.60 --> 1760.82]  Every month, you'll get something to read, as well as something to collect.
[1760.96 --> 1761.36]  I mean, yeah.
[1761.62 --> 1764.26]  Use code Linus and get $6 off your first box.
[1764.68 --> 1771.44]  By using this discount code, you'll be entered for a chance to win a copy of New Mutants, number
[1771.44 --> 1773.88]  98, which is worth over $400.
[1775.08 --> 1775.44]  Sick.
[1775.80 --> 1776.16]  Truth.
[1777.04 --> 1777.44]  Truth.
[1777.96 --> 1779.70]  I don't think it actually said exactly how much it costs.
[1779.70 --> 1782.96]  But you can save money if you use offer code Linus.
[1783.04 --> 1783.66]  So do that.
[1783.78 --> 1784.54]  That's actually pretty cool.
[1784.54 --> 1790.58]  If you have, like, kids, or you're, like, a teacher or something like that, you could just read these and then just pass them out.
[1791.20 --> 1799.40]  Something that I really like about this kind of stuff is if you have, like, little nephews and nieces and stuff.
[1799.52 --> 1799.72]  Yeah.
[1800.04 --> 1801.38]  You just always have...
[1801.38 --> 1801.90]  That's what I'm saying.
[1802.02 --> 1802.38]  Presence.
[1802.50 --> 1802.84]  Here you go.
[1803.20 --> 1803.40]  Yeah.
[1803.72 --> 1804.58]  This is a lot.
[1804.66 --> 1804.96]  Oh, hey.
[1805.10 --> 1805.92]  Haven't seen you for a bit.
[1806.10 --> 1806.86]  Take five comics.
[1807.06 --> 1807.20]  Yeah.
[1807.20 --> 1807.90]  I'm the cool uncle.
[1807.96 --> 1808.76]  You're the coolest one.
[1808.86 --> 1809.04]  Yeah.
[1809.92 --> 1810.28]  Absolutely.
[1810.84 --> 1813.74]  Speaking of cool uncle, Savage Jerky.
[1814.42 --> 1814.70]  Savage.
[1817.64 --> 1818.56]  Reaper's scary.
[1818.72 --> 1819.98]  I'm not surprised that one's not open yet.
[1819.98 --> 1824.20]  We have Reaper, Sriracha Bacon, and Habanero Buffalo Sauce.
[1824.20 --> 1830.96]  I have been told we're getting more soon because part of the problem at Linus Media Group is everyone eats it all the time.
[1831.20 --> 1833.58]  So we, like, never have the jerky for the actual asphalt.
[1833.60 --> 1834.36]  We need a vending machine.
[1834.88 --> 1835.76]  Oh, my goodness.
[1835.76 --> 1839.50]  That, like, costs money for other people, but on the Wancho, we have, like, a thing.
[1839.82 --> 1840.62]  A Wancho token.
[1840.86 --> 1842.48]  A token that the string on it or something.
[1843.60 --> 1844.08]  Yeah.
[1844.34 --> 1845.20]  That would be awesome.
[1845.70 --> 1846.98]  What makes a great jerky?
[1847.28 --> 1850.20]  You may think it's flavor, but that's the half of it.
[1850.20 --> 1859.24]  Savage Jerky is handcrafted in small batches and used the best ingredients to create the highest product possible, but I think they mean highest quality product possible.
[1859.24 --> 1860.16]  Look how high this is.
[1860.62 --> 1861.56]  It's out of France.
[1861.62 --> 1862.72]  It's extremely elevated.
[1863.74 --> 1868.36]  Without the need for nitrates or preservatives, their goal is to make a fantastic snack that tastes great.
[1868.70 --> 1875.04]  And they have 13 different flavors from their sweet teriyaki to the intense, spicy Carolina Reaper.
[1875.04 --> 1880.06]  They also make hot sauces, which they have here and are amazing and are actually, I like the jerky.
[1880.20 --> 1882.52]  But the hot sauces are my favorite part, 100%.
[1882.52 --> 1884.16]  They're very good.
[1884.80 --> 1889.06]  They also have spice rub as well, which I have tried and was good.
[1889.22 --> 1890.50]  That was just a really long time ago.
[1891.78 --> 1897.26]  This weekend only, you can use offer code LTT to save not 10%, but 20.
[1897.76 --> 1898.68]  Usually, that's a 10.
[1899.28 --> 1901.62]  Currently, it's a 20 on all of their products.
[1901.74 --> 1903.14]  That's 100% more savings, guys.
[1903.60 --> 1903.86]  Boom.
[1903.86 --> 1903.98]  Boom.
[1903.98 --> 1905.18]  They're overstock on bacon.
[1905.38 --> 1911.94]  So make sure you load up as much maple and sriracha bacon as you can at lmg.gg slash savage jerky.
[1912.14 --> 1913.06]  Liquidating that bacon.
[1913.40 --> 1913.66]  Boom.
[1914.16 --> 1921.52]  The and part that got cut off earlier was that it's great and it's not bad for you, considering the preservatives and nitrates not in there kind of deal.
[1922.02 --> 1922.46]  Good stuff.
[1922.70 --> 1922.98]  Oh, yeah.
[1923.10 --> 1923.56]  Tastes good.
[1923.66 --> 1924.20]  Good for you.
[1924.38 --> 1925.26]  Their sauces are fucking amazing.
[1925.26 --> 1926.50]  I would really like to smell this.
[1926.60 --> 1926.68]  Can I open this?
[1926.68 --> 1927.72]  I have smuggled out.
[1927.96 --> 1928.22]  Sorry?
[1928.36 --> 1928.86]  Can I open it?
[1928.86 --> 1930.86]  Maybe?
[1932.46 --> 1933.08]  I don't know.
[1934.40 --> 1934.76]  Later.
[1935.60 --> 1936.48]  Jono's writing on the dock.
[1936.56 --> 1937.40]  Can we open one of these?
[1938.38 --> 1939.82]  Jono, I want to smell it.
[1940.16 --> 1941.14]  I see you type in there.
[1942.00 --> 1942.38]  Whoa, whoa.
[1943.34 --> 1943.86]  Oh, I hear footprints.
[1943.86 --> 1944.30]  He's running.
[1944.54 --> 1944.98]  I hear them.
[1946.66 --> 1947.68]  He's running down the stairs.
[1947.68 --> 1948.32]  Now he's down the stairs.
[1948.38 --> 1950.14]  I was going to go to the next section, but we're going to wait.
[1950.36 --> 1952.42]  It's just like Godzilla when you see the water shaking.
[1952.68 --> 1953.12]  There he is.
[1953.26 --> 1953.66]  He's here.
[1953.80 --> 1954.24]  There he is.
[1954.30 --> 1955.00]  He's approaching us.
[1955.16 --> 1955.74]  Lower third.
[1956.52 --> 1957.84]  Oh, no.
[1957.84 --> 1959.02]  There it is.
[1959.26 --> 1960.44]  Okay, well, we're still doing the thing.
[1960.46 --> 1961.62]  Can I open this and then smell it?
[1961.74 --> 1962.30]  Yeah, yeah, go ahead.
[1962.92 --> 1964.78]  Can I put my tongue in there and lick the...
[1964.78 --> 1965.56]  You can keep the bottle.
[1965.98 --> 1966.72]  I can keep the bottle.
[1966.72 --> 1968.82]  Oh, you were just granted a bottle.
[1969.10 --> 1970.00]  These are really good.
[1970.10 --> 1970.72]  Which one is that?
[1970.82 --> 1971.48]  I'm not telling you.
[1971.52 --> 1971.82]  It's mine.
[1972.48 --> 1973.22]  Well, is it a Reaper?
[1973.40 --> 1974.22]  It's a Reaper.
[1974.22 --> 1975.34]  It's a Reaper hot sauce.
[1975.80 --> 1977.20]  We don't mess around in my place.
[1977.34 --> 1978.14]  Oh, there's more to open.
[1978.92 --> 1979.86]  Oh, that comes off easy.
[1981.42 --> 1982.72]  What else do you want to take, Luke?
[1983.62 --> 1984.58]  There's the herb blend.
[1985.20 --> 1986.16]  Okay, this is the one I've tried.
[1986.24 --> 1986.76]  This one's really good.
[1986.78 --> 1987.64]  And the spice rub.
[1988.20 --> 1989.02]  Spice rub.
[1989.98 --> 1994.80]  Okay, so they've got like a just savage jerky spice rub, which is probably really solid.
[1995.02 --> 1999.58]  I've also got the herb blend, which I believe is more in the mojo side of things.
[1999.58 --> 1999.74]  Give us a sniff.
[1999.98 --> 2000.70]  Sniff too hard.
[2000.80 --> 2001.68]  Sniff harder than you would.
[2004.44 --> 2005.20]  You get goosebumps?
[2006.08 --> 2006.86]  A little bit.
[2007.42 --> 2007.94]  It's like...
[2007.94 --> 2009.52]  You get a little bit of the spice response.
[2009.66 --> 2010.62]  I can feel it in my throat.
[2010.62 --> 2011.12]  Wow.
[2011.80 --> 2012.28]  Wow.
[2012.76 --> 2013.96]  Pavlov's a dog over here.
[2014.16 --> 2016.30]  On the other hand, this one probably smells delicious.
[2016.48 --> 2017.58]  This is Carolina...
[2017.58 --> 2018.24]  Carolina.
[2018.72 --> 2019.62]  Sorry, John.
[2020.88 --> 2022.42]  Carolina Habanero Pineapple.
[2022.42 --> 2024.16]  Oh.
[2024.48 --> 2026.22]  That's got like a mustard smell to it.
[2027.50 --> 2028.14]  Definitely does.
[2029.96 --> 2031.50]  Oh, but then...
[2031.50 --> 2032.60]  Like spicy mustard.
[2032.60 --> 2034.16]  But there's like this...
[2034.16 --> 2038.54]  Deep within there, I'm getting triggered like nostalgia of when I was a kid and I used
[2038.54 --> 2042.56]  to like get McNuggets and like...
[2042.56 --> 2043.86]  And dip them.
[2044.58 --> 2047.46]  Some of them smells like the dip they had in McDonald's in the 90s.
[2049.22 --> 2049.82]  It's deep.
[2050.26 --> 2050.70]  It's...
[2050.70 --> 2054.00]  That's in like my...
[2054.00 --> 2054.38]  Okay.
[2054.52 --> 2055.28]  Id, you know?
[2055.36 --> 2055.56]  Okay.
[2055.82 --> 2058.20]  Yeah, I think I kind of...
[2058.20 --> 2061.42]  That's a weird recollection, but I think I see where you're coming from.
[2061.50 --> 2063.00]  In a good way, to be clear.
[2063.30 --> 2063.66]  Completely.
[2063.80 --> 2064.00]  Yeah.
[2064.26 --> 2064.60]  Completely.
[2064.92 --> 2065.80]  That's interesting.
[2065.94 --> 2066.88]  I want to steal that and take it.
[2066.88 --> 2067.20]  All right.
[2067.26 --> 2068.20]  I'm going camping.
[2068.44 --> 2069.64]  I can put this on burgers.
[2069.64 --> 2069.98]  Just take it.
[2070.14 --> 2070.30]  Just.
[2070.38 --> 2071.90]  Oh, it's definitely coming.
[2072.08 --> 2072.58]  Just take it.
[2072.58 --> 2072.80]  Okay.
[2072.92 --> 2073.64]  We've got to move on.
[2073.64 --> 2074.50]  We've been on this one for too long.
[2074.78 --> 2075.20]  PIA.
[2075.84 --> 2076.38]  All right.
[2076.46 --> 2077.52]  Private Internet Access.
[2077.88 --> 2079.64]  Private Internet Access is a variety VPN...
[2080.66 --> 2081.02]  Sorry.
[2081.28 --> 2086.18]  Supports a variety of VPN protocols and types of encryption and authentication, allowing
[2086.18 --> 2088.94]  you to dial in the exact level of privacy protection you need.
[2089.22 --> 2092.20]  It has apps for Windows, Mac OS, Android, iOS.
[2092.64 --> 2093.96]  It still says Linus.
[2094.96 --> 2097.16]  I think at this point, I think it's just a joke.
[2097.34 --> 2098.54]  I don't think they're ever going to fix it.
[2099.04 --> 2102.36]  And Google Chrome with support for several other platforms coming soon.
[2102.36 --> 2104.22]  By the way, the Linus part is supposed to be Linux.
[2104.68 --> 2109.78]  They have over 3,000 bare metal servers in 44 locations across 28 countries.
[2110.12 --> 2112.02]  Connect up to five devices at the same time.
[2112.40 --> 2116.32]  Apps include DNS leak protection and IPv6 protection, IP cloaking.
[2116.40 --> 2119.48]  One of my favorite things that isn't actually in here is the internet kill switch.
[2119.56 --> 2119.72]  Yeah.
[2119.72 --> 2123.86]  Which is where if your VPN cuts out for whatever reason, it just turns off your internet.
[2124.48 --> 2129.68]  That is good because if you're doing something that you really want to be going through a VPN,
[2130.24 --> 2135.58]  you don't want the VPN to drop and keep transmitting because then that data will be...
[2135.58 --> 2136.04]  Exposed.
[2136.04 --> 2136.56]  Exposed.
[2137.16 --> 2137.42]  Exactly.
[2137.48 --> 2139.16]  What is bare metal server?
[2139.22 --> 2139.62]  What does that mean?
[2139.62 --> 2143.00]  That just basically means they're not necessarily...
[2143.00 --> 2145.84]  They don't just have a bunch of virtual servers all over the place.
[2146.28 --> 2148.86]  They have a whole box for themselves.
[2149.26 --> 2152.12]  They have over 3,000 whole boxes.
[2152.60 --> 2157.08]  I wouldn't be surprised if they were VPSed within there, but they have control of 3,000 whole boxes.
[2157.22 --> 2158.22]  IRL servers.
[2158.36 --> 2159.86]  That's like some meat.
[2160.66 --> 2162.58]  I got some meat going on there.
[2162.70 --> 2163.58]  Put that on your...
[2163.58 --> 2163.84]  Yeah.
[2164.16 --> 2164.36]  Yeah.
[2167.96 --> 2169.56]  Let's move back to this scene.
[2169.70 --> 2170.04]  There we go.
[2170.26 --> 2171.00]  It's been too long.
[2171.10 --> 2171.98]  Anyways, jackets!
[2172.74 --> 2173.66]  Oh my god.
[2173.70 --> 2175.38]  People have seen these for a long time.
[2176.10 --> 2176.88]  They're stylish.
[2177.10 --> 2178.06]  They're available now, baby!
[2178.18 --> 2178.76]  They're fancy.
[2179.48 --> 2180.34]  The hood's huge.
[2180.42 --> 2181.36]  My brother would love that.
[2181.72 --> 2182.84]  I'm going to be a Sith real quick.
[2182.98 --> 2183.50]  What up, dudes?
[2184.58 --> 2185.28]  They're stretchy.
[2185.60 --> 2186.24]  They're stretchy.
[2186.60 --> 2187.86]  But also not stretchy.
[2187.86 --> 2190.26]  They stretch and then they're stretching until they're not.
[2190.42 --> 2191.14]  And then they don't.
[2191.32 --> 2192.22]  Because they're...
[2192.22 --> 2193.00]  What do you call it?
[2193.00 --> 2193.60]  The Swatchit?
[2193.96 --> 2194.88]  They call it the Swackit.
[2194.96 --> 2196.50]  That's what it's called on the LTT store.
[2196.68 --> 2196.84]  Yeah.
[2197.46 --> 2204.84]  So that's because this color of gray, the more notable gray material, is like tough jacket material.
[2205.14 --> 2207.90]  And then the black material is sweater.
[2208.20 --> 2210.36]  You can see the pockets are really stretchy.
[2210.68 --> 2214.72]  The arms stretch for half an inch and then they're really rigid.
[2214.72 --> 2216.86]  Because this little bit will stretch forward.
[2217.00 --> 2219.20]  So you have a little bit of stretch in there, which is kind of nice.
[2219.20 --> 2219.40]  Yeah.
[2219.80 --> 2223.40]  We also noticed last time we were on WAN, which I could...
[2223.40 --> 2224.20]  I mean, I'll just do it.
[2224.34 --> 2224.58]  Whatever.
[2224.86 --> 2225.86]  He's going to do it, guys.
[2225.90 --> 2226.50]  He's doing it live.
[2226.66 --> 2227.18]  I am.
[2227.58 --> 2228.08]  Hold on.
[2228.38 --> 2228.84]  One second.
[2229.48 --> 2230.20]  Use your motor skills.
[2230.76 --> 2231.36]  I'm trying.
[2231.52 --> 2231.92]  I'm struggling.
[2233.26 --> 2233.66]  Okay.
[2233.80 --> 2235.22]  That was not the jacket's fault.
[2235.42 --> 2238.22]  I kept repeatedly having my shirt be in the jacket, which wasn't great.
[2238.38 --> 2238.56]  Okay.
[2238.60 --> 2238.92]  Hold on.
[2239.46 --> 2240.88]  I'm going to use a different LTT product.
[2240.88 --> 2248.82]  The mic definitely got that.
[2250.28 --> 2250.94]  Oh, no.
[2251.46 --> 2252.82]  I dripped all over myself.
[2252.98 --> 2254.18]  That went on my shorts, which isn't going to come off.
[2254.18 --> 2255.12]  You're doing a great job.
[2255.22 --> 2257.96]  But it's on the sweater part and it still comes right off.
[2258.00 --> 2258.66]  Oh, you did that on purpose?
[2259.00 --> 2259.20]  Yeah.
[2259.30 --> 2260.46]  Oh, I thought you were...
[2260.46 --> 2262.32]  I thought this guy can't zip.
[2262.40 --> 2263.08]  He can't drink.
[2263.22 --> 2263.96]  Like, holy cow.
[2263.96 --> 2264.42]  Yeah, no.
[2264.64 --> 2268.18]  The sweater part is like water wicking to a certain degree as well.
[2268.24 --> 2270.52]  You can see that's already dried off, which is awesome.
[2270.52 --> 2271.06]  And this part of it?
[2271.18 --> 2271.34]  Yeah.
[2271.60 --> 2271.94]  Okay.
[2272.00 --> 2273.32]  And this is the stretchy sweater part.
[2273.48 --> 2273.76]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2273.76 --> 2275.04]  So, like, it's...
[2275.04 --> 2277.74]  This part isn't as jackety as this part.
[2278.08 --> 2279.16]  That's the sweater part.
[2279.16 --> 2279.68]  But it's still...
[2279.68 --> 2279.90]  Yeah.
[2279.98 --> 2280.86]  That's the jacket part.
[2280.88 --> 2281.40]  It's still water wicking.
[2281.40 --> 2284.18]  Oh, but nonetheless, it has jacket qualities.
[2284.20 --> 2285.38]  It still works kind of like a jacket.
[2285.56 --> 2286.68]  It's not going to be as good.
[2286.78 --> 2288.96]  If you're in, like, torrential rain, it will probably soak it.
[2288.98 --> 2289.34]  Sure.
[2289.60 --> 2293.42]  But, like, a little bit of water, you're still going to be okay, which is pretty sweet.
[2293.42 --> 2293.54]  You got this, though.
[2295.24 --> 2295.46]  Yeah.
[2295.66 --> 2296.16]  There you go.
[2296.26 --> 2296.56]  Perfect.
[2296.94 --> 2297.96]  There's also, like...
[2297.96 --> 2300.74]  There's a big inside pocket right here.
[2301.28 --> 2304.74]  This is where the sizing and how to treat information is, by the way.
[2304.96 --> 2305.28]  Information.
[2306.38 --> 2307.74]  Big pockets on each side.
[2307.86 --> 2308.60]  What else did they give us?
[2309.06 --> 2309.52]  I don't know.
[2310.74 --> 2311.94]  Oh, there's the new hats?
[2312.62 --> 2313.48]  These are the tech-linked.
[2313.66 --> 2314.68]  Officially what they're going to be?
[2314.68 --> 2315.10]  Tech-linked hats.
[2315.24 --> 2315.42]  Yeah.
[2315.48 --> 2315.82]  I don't know.
[2316.76 --> 2317.98]  But I've been wearing one.
[2318.58 --> 2319.26]  I think they're cool.
[2319.42 --> 2320.12]  These are super cool.
[2320.60 --> 2322.20]  They're not that in-your-face, you know?
[2322.48 --> 2323.86]  It's like, hey, what kind of hat is that?
[2323.86 --> 2326.74]  That classy, cool, snazzy hat that guy's got going on.
[2326.88 --> 2327.58]  Yeah, it looks all right.
[2328.46 --> 2329.10]  There we go.
[2331.44 --> 2333.66]  I think this is all just stuff that's...
[2333.66 --> 2334.58]  There's also...
[2334.58 --> 2339.64]  So, to keep talking about the jacket, these lines, this silver line, and I believe...
[2340.28 --> 2340.96]  Those are high-vis.
[2342.08 --> 2343.88]  This orange line seems not quite.
[2344.06 --> 2344.98]  It's just very bright.
[2345.14 --> 2345.72]  I'm just going to...
[2345.72 --> 2346.40]  I could be wrong, though.
[2346.40 --> 2347.20]  I'll do this.
[2347.20 --> 2347.74]  Yeah, there we go.
[2348.56 --> 2349.52]  Is this doing it?
[2349.76 --> 2350.68]  The phone light is...
[2350.68 --> 2351.32]  It's doing nothing.
[2351.32 --> 2352.72]  Too bad to do it.
[2353.08 --> 2357.78]  But, yeah, this silver part is high-vis, which is actually nice if you're going to be walking
[2357.78 --> 2358.24]  around at night.
[2358.36 --> 2358.94]  That's a good thing.
[2359.36 --> 2360.36]  It's a very good thing.
[2361.44 --> 2362.02]  There we go.
[2362.06 --> 2363.04]  Well, I'm keeping this hat on now.
[2363.54 --> 2363.82]  Perfect.
[2364.68 --> 2366.56]  I don't think I look great in hats, but I think it looks good on you.
[2366.56 --> 2367.04]  Let me see it again.
[2371.82 --> 2372.14]  Nah.
[2372.38 --> 2372.86]  Yeah, see?
[2373.90 --> 2374.22]  Nah.
[2374.38 --> 2375.44]  I just got to go with the no hat.
[2375.68 --> 2376.34]  That's okay, though.
[2376.40 --> 2376.84]  It does suck at you.
[2376.84 --> 2377.74]  All the other LTT merch.
[2377.82 --> 2378.40]  I know, it's weird.
[2378.68 --> 2380.32]  My wife hates when I wear hats and hoodies.
[2380.32 --> 2381.98]  She thinks I look like I'm from Abbotsford.
[2382.16 --> 2384.40]  My girlfriend loves when I wear hats, but I hate it.
[2385.32 --> 2389.52]  Abbotsford is far from Vancouver, but not as far as Chilliwack, where Colton lives.
[2389.70 --> 2390.48]  They all wear hats.
[2391.84 --> 2392.90]  I was going to say it.
[2392.98 --> 2396.56]  I was like, it feels more like the people where I grew up, because it's more that direction.
[2398.58 --> 2399.82]  Anyways, is that the show?
[2399.90 --> 2400.20]  No.
[2400.20 --> 2401.30]  We ought to talk about Huawei.
[2402.30 --> 2402.58]  Huawei.
[2402.96 --> 2404.88]  The other one's kind of not that interesting.
[2405.24 --> 2407.14]  Huawei's folding phone gets delayed again.
[2407.30 --> 2407.66]  Oh, no.
[2407.66 --> 2408.68]  It's kind of interesting.
[2409.88 --> 2410.32]  Is it?
[2410.82 --> 2411.00]  Yeah.
[2411.08 --> 2411.34]  Okay.
[2411.34 --> 2411.86]  Go into it.
[2412.10 --> 2412.40]  All right.
[2412.72 --> 2413.06]  I want to hear.
[2413.08 --> 2413.10]  I want to hear.
[2413.10 --> 2420.52]  Because Samsung has been developing this folding AMOLED display tech for like six years and spent
[2420.52 --> 2421.26]  billions on it.
[2421.32 --> 2421.42]  Yeah.
[2421.48 --> 2422.20]  Or not billions.
[2422.36 --> 2422.96]  Not billions.
[2423.26 --> 2423.96]  But tens of millions.
[2424.08 --> 2424.60]  Hundreds of millions.
[2424.98 --> 2425.96]  They spent a lot of money on it.
[2426.00 --> 2427.28]  And apparently, I didn't know this.
[2427.34 --> 2428.20]  I missed this story.
[2428.26 --> 2432.06]  But in November of 2018, they had their technology stolen.
[2432.72 --> 2432.98]  Oh.
[2433.08 --> 2433.66]  Did you hear that?
[2433.82 --> 2434.10]  No.
[2434.58 --> 2434.82]  Yeah.
[2435.00 --> 2436.82]  There was like, people got prosecuted and stuff.
[2437.32 --> 2443.88]  And so, I don't know how they pulled it off, but some people were able to steal like blueprints
[2443.88 --> 2449.06]  and other relevant documentation such that they were able to sell it for $14 million.
[2450.24 --> 2450.64]  Oh.
[2450.64 --> 2454.16]  And then, I don't know if it's public knowledge of like, who bought it.
[2454.46 --> 2456.28]  They had like some shell company stuff going on.
[2458.18 --> 2459.32]  Maybe Huawei bought it.
[2459.38 --> 2459.80]  I don't know.
[2460.28 --> 2467.34]  But, so, that is why Samsung rushed to market with a product, their folding phone, that they
[2467.34 --> 2470.38]  didn't, obviously, they didn't test it enough because all the YouTubers and stuff who got
[2470.38 --> 2472.66]  early access to it, there were so many problems they had to recall it.
[2472.80 --> 2472.84]  Yeah.
[2472.84 --> 2472.90]  Yeah.
[2472.96 --> 2473.86]  So, they rushed.
[2473.98 --> 2475.22]  And the question is why?
[2475.28 --> 2479.86]  And it's because they didn't have the head start that they would have had they not had the
[2479.86 --> 2480.44]  text stolen.
[2481.50 --> 2485.38]  And so, the funny part here is that Huawei, whether or not they stole it, I don't know.
[2486.46 --> 2490.30]  Huawei is just another company that still, that also can't bring this to market.
[2490.72 --> 2490.98]  Yeah.
[2491.14 --> 2496.06]  And so, originally, they said that their folding phone, the Mate X, I almost said Mate 10.
[2496.20 --> 2496.72]  Thanks, Apple.
[2496.96 --> 2501.86]  The Mate X was supposed to come out mid-2019, which would have been, I guess, July, June,
[2501.86 --> 2502.18]  July.
[2502.88 --> 2509.40]  It got pushed to September because of the tariffs, the Trump tariff stuff.
[2509.40 --> 2512.14]  And then now they're saying it's getting pushed till November.
[2512.82 --> 2515.68]  And they're saying, we're really going to make that deadline because they want to hit
[2515.68 --> 2516.50]  the holiday season.
[2516.76 --> 2516.86]  But...
[2516.86 --> 2517.18]  Ah, yeah.
[2518.16 --> 2518.80]  We'll see.
[2520.20 --> 2520.60]  Yeah.
[2520.88 --> 2522.68]  I, um...
[2522.68 --> 2525.12]  That was a lot more interesting than the notes.
[2525.38 --> 2526.02]  So, thank you.
[2526.42 --> 2527.24]  Because I didn't care.
[2527.34 --> 2529.50]  But now there's this whole conspiracy behind it and stuff.
[2529.54 --> 2529.76]  Yeah.
[2529.84 --> 2530.34]  I love it.
[2530.48 --> 2531.24]  Not even conspiracy.
[2531.70 --> 2532.30]  They caught them.
[2532.82 --> 2533.58]  It happened.
[2533.76 --> 2534.10]  That's real.
[2534.18 --> 2534.94]  It's beyond that.
[2535.32 --> 2536.48]  That's pretty cool, actually.
[2537.12 --> 2538.42]  I like when that kind of stuff gets interesting.
[2538.42 --> 2539.84]  I just like...
[2539.84 --> 2540.26]  I don't know.
[2540.38 --> 2540.82]  It's a...
[2540.82 --> 2541.18]  What?
[2541.28 --> 2543.18]  Like a $2,700 phone?
[2543.26 --> 2544.46]  $2,600 phone?
[2544.56 --> 2545.32]  U.S.?
[2545.32 --> 2545.66]  Yeah.
[2545.82 --> 2546.84]  I'm not buying it.
[2547.02 --> 2547.42]  Like, I don't...
[2547.42 --> 2550.80]  Like, that's more than people are spending on high-end gaming PCs.
[2551.10 --> 2552.60]  Like, that's crazy.
[2552.60 --> 2553.42]  That's more than...
[2554.12 --> 2556.76]  I believe any of my friend's first cars.
[2557.52 --> 2557.72]  Hmm.
[2558.28 --> 2559.00]  Definitely more than mine.
[2559.16 --> 2559.38]  Yeah.
[2560.64 --> 2561.58]  That's too much.
[2561.58 --> 2565.46]  How long do you think it'll take for them to be mainstream prices?
[2565.46 --> 2566.24]  I think it'll take a while.
[2566.44 --> 2567.18]  But that's the thing.
[2567.28 --> 2571.48]  It's like, I am not that interested in the early adopter tax on this.
[2571.56 --> 2575.14]  I paid early adopter tax on a bunch of, like, VR stuff that was terrible.
[2575.32 --> 2576.64]  Because I was super interested in it.
[2576.90 --> 2578.78]  And I feel like this is the same kind of situation.
[2578.90 --> 2579.96]  But I'm not super interested in it.
[2579.96 --> 2580.30]  So, I don't care.
[2580.34 --> 2581.40]  I'm sure some people are.
[2581.98 --> 2583.14]  But, like, whatever.
[2583.26 --> 2583.92]  It's just a phone.
[2584.28 --> 2588.14]  If they had some, like, crazy new insane technology for computers,
[2588.64 --> 2590.88]  and it was overpriced and junk, I'd probably still be into it.
[2591.12 --> 2592.42]  Because that's more in my realm.
[2592.78 --> 2595.04]  Like, if Apple released AR glasses, that were sweet.
[2595.26 --> 2595.78]  Dude, I'm in.
[2596.70 --> 2597.04]  Yeah.
[2597.44 --> 2598.10]  Let's do it.
[2598.70 --> 2600.38]  AR is amazing to me.
[2600.44 --> 2601.56]  I'm totally on that.
[2601.64 --> 2602.46]  But, like, it's just...
[2602.46 --> 2603.02]  Yeah, it's different.
[2603.28 --> 2603.40]  I don't know.
[2603.40 --> 2605.84]  This one, I'm hoping, like, Dbrand sends us one.
[2605.84 --> 2607.16]  And then Linus hates it.
[2607.36 --> 2608.22]  So, it's just sitting on the shelf.
[2608.32 --> 2609.42]  And then I can use it for a week.
[2609.64 --> 2609.90]  Sweet.
[2610.36 --> 2610.58]  Yeah.
[2610.60 --> 2611.04]  That's big.
[2611.04 --> 2613.06]  Let's do a daily driver swap for one week.
[2613.16 --> 2613.78]  That'd be pretty interesting.
[2614.12 --> 2616.28]  Okay, do you think, though, that it'll push...
[2616.28 --> 2619.40]  Once it becomes normalized, it'll push the prices of normal phones,
[2619.44 --> 2620.68]  like the ones we're using, down?
[2620.90 --> 2623.94]  Or do you think these phones will stay at a grand or $1,100,
[2624.42 --> 2628.56]  and then these things will be, like, $200 to $300 more at all times?
[2628.70 --> 2630.76]  And it'll just be, like, now we're all just paying more for phones.
[2630.88 --> 2631.04]  Yep.
[2631.22 --> 2631.40]  Yeah.
[2631.90 --> 2632.18]  Yep.
[2633.64 --> 2634.34]  We'll see, though.
[2634.36 --> 2635.26]  That's the thing about prices.
[2635.78 --> 2637.18]  Nothing's really worth anything.
[2637.48 --> 2639.64]  It's worth as much as you'll pay for it.
[2639.74 --> 2639.90]  Yeah.
[2639.90 --> 2640.58]  And you start...
[2640.58 --> 2641.32]  It's all relative.
[2641.56 --> 2642.02]  And there's...
[2642.02 --> 2643.16]  Whatever your anchor point is...
[2643.16 --> 2645.10]  That's where the price is.
[2645.20 --> 2645.38]  Yeah.
[2646.04 --> 2651.72]  And, like, they have been getting some backlash because the generational improvement isn't
[2651.72 --> 2653.44]  really there and the prices have been going up.
[2653.62 --> 2656.30]  So phone sales are going down.
[2656.44 --> 2657.62]  And I think they're starting to feel that.
[2657.68 --> 2660.26]  And they've done some price zoning and stuff around that.
[2660.32 --> 2662.36]  So, like, I wouldn't be surprised if something happens to prices.
[2662.36 --> 2666.62]  But I don't think we're going to see these phones go down in price because of the folding
[2666.62 --> 2667.46]  phones, is what I would say.
[2667.46 --> 2667.80]  No, no.
[2668.04 --> 2670.66]  They might go down in price due to other factors.
[2670.84 --> 2671.00]  Yeah.
[2671.08 --> 2674.02]  Thank God we have China here to commoditize this whole category.
[2674.36 --> 2676.78]  But I don't think it'll be because of the folding phones.
[2677.18 --> 2682.56]  Another thing Huawei is in the news for is that they helped African government spy on political
[2682.56 --> 2683.50]  employees.
[2683.50 --> 2683.82]  Zambia.
[2684.54 --> 2684.90]  Sweet.
[2685.28 --> 2689.14]  The Wall Street Journal reports that Huawei Technologies intercepted communications from
[2689.14 --> 2692.84]  government opposition in Uganda and Zambia.
[2693.80 --> 2694.24]  Zambia?
[2694.38 --> 2694.80]  Zambia?
[2694.86 --> 2695.98]  Bunch of zombies live there.
[2696.72 --> 2697.12]  Zambia?
[2697.12 --> 2698.80]  How do I not know how to say that?
[2698.98 --> 2699.72]  That's Zambia, bro.
[2699.88 --> 2700.28]  Zambia.
[2700.60 --> 2701.66]  I mean, maybe it's Zambia.
[2701.82 --> 2702.40]  I'm terrible.
[2702.54 --> 2703.42]  No, I think it's Zambia.
[2703.92 --> 2704.84]  Zame, Zame, but different.
[2704.90 --> 2706.86]  I feel like I haven't read that name in years.
[2708.26 --> 2710.30]  I looked at that and was like, video game location?
[2712.72 --> 2713.52]  I'm terrible.
[2713.72 --> 2715.42]  I need to get on the geography train.
[2715.54 --> 2718.20]  I'm sure John is so upset with me right now.
[2718.64 --> 2720.00]  Yeah, Zambia is right next to Wakanda.
[2721.52 --> 2724.54]  Yeah, it's a fictional African state.
[2724.72 --> 2725.72]  See, I can pronounce that one.
[2726.00 --> 2726.22]  Yeah.
[2727.12 --> 2730.08]  They delivered them to police.
[2730.22 --> 2734.34]  Encrypted messages were gathered and political opponents were tracked using cellular data.
[2734.72 --> 2742.96]  Representatives of Uganda and Zambia deny the allegations.
[2742.96 --> 2748.24]  Huawei underwent an international investigation and found their employees weren't involved.
[2749.86 --> 2752.02]  There's literally insert large eye roll.
[2753.66 --> 2754.06]  Indeed.
[2754.06 --> 2760.12]  The Wall Street Journal does not indicate that Huawei executives were aware of what was happening in Africa.
[2760.12 --> 2763.96]  But like, yeah, I don't know.
[2764.08 --> 2768.54]  Some underlings might have been paid off, but kind of doubt it.
[2768.80 --> 2772.68]  Considering, isn't there a huge amount of Chinese investment going on in Africa?
[2772.96 --> 2773.42]  Oh, tons.
[2773.60 --> 2773.84]  Yeah.
[2774.00 --> 2774.58]  Tons and tons.
[2774.72 --> 2775.18]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2775.34 --> 2779.66]  So they're trying to like pseudo-own Africa as far as I can.
[2779.66 --> 2781.88]  I wasn't going to say it on air.
[2782.68 --> 2782.94]  Oh.
[2784.04 --> 2784.66]  All right.
[2785.30 --> 2785.74]  Well, I'm not.
[2786.12 --> 2789.36]  They give really large and very low interest loans.
[2789.36 --> 2800.38]  And it helps them when there's like a vote on Taiwan or something like that to have different political leaders vote their way because they kind of owe them one.
[2801.52 --> 2801.96]  Right.
[2802.68 --> 2803.12]  Yeah.
[2803.84 --> 2804.28]  Interesting.
[2805.66 --> 2806.52]  Smart move for them.
[2806.52 --> 2806.72]  Yeah.
[2806.72 --> 2808.94]  Is there any other news?
[2809.04 --> 2809.76]  I don't think so.
[2810.68 --> 2812.54]  I have a little bit of a bone to pick.
[2813.00 --> 2813.24]  Uh-oh.
[2813.96 --> 2815.76]  You do the keyboard stuff at Linus Media Group, right?
[2815.92 --> 2816.30]  Okay.
[2816.52 --> 2816.92]  Yeah, maybe.
[2818.00 --> 2819.88]  Why haven't you guys jumped on the custom train yet?
[2820.36 --> 2820.92]  What do you mean?
[2821.32 --> 2827.40]  There's like, there's whole YouTubers and like a bunch of really big Twitch streamers.
[2827.54 --> 2828.02]  I know.
[2828.02 --> 2830.02]  Oh, wow.
[2830.16 --> 2830.90]  He plays Fortnite.
[2831.32 --> 2832.28]  His name's not Ninja.
[2833.50 --> 2835.00]  It's a different dude who plays Fortnite.
[2835.16 --> 2836.02]  He's been in...
[2836.02 --> 2836.52]  Sh...
[2836.52 --> 2837.64]  Shay...
[2837.64 --> 2838.64]  Shay...
[2838.64 --> 2838.88]  No?
[2840.44 --> 2841.14]  What's that guy?
[2841.34 --> 2842.46]  He's been in Mr. Beast videos.
[2842.76 --> 2843.08]  Okay.
[2843.24 --> 2844.72]  Mr. Beast has done a few things for him.
[2844.80 --> 2845.08]  Okay.
[2845.76 --> 2846.84]  I don't remember the dude's name.
[2847.24 --> 2847.58]  Tfew.
[2847.92 --> 2848.80]  Oh, not what I was thinking.
[2848.80 --> 2849.98]  Tfew has a custom keyboard.
[2850.40 --> 2852.12]  Skara has a custom keyboard.
[2852.44 --> 2854.00]  A bunch of these guys, a bunch of these streamers are getting custom-made keyboards.
[2854.00 --> 2855.50]  Oh, are you talking about like a merch keyboard?
[2855.70 --> 2857.06]  Like an LTT keyboard?
[2857.26 --> 2857.40]  No, no, no.
[2857.40 --> 2857.90]  What are you talking about?
[2857.90 --> 2861.96]  Like custom body, custom PCB, custom plate, custom switches.
[2862.66 --> 2863.72]  Yeah, I'd like to do...
[2863.72 --> 2864.90]  I actually would like to do that.
[2865.10 --> 2868.86]  I've been fantasizing for a while about my ideal, like my wishlist keyboard.
[2868.98 --> 2870.42]  I actually did pitch this to Linus.
[2870.52 --> 2870.90]  I was...
[2870.90 --> 2873.76]  I thought of a series where we do like our wishlist product.
[2873.90 --> 2877.70]  You know, we did do a video that was like, what would the perfect monitor be like?
[2877.78 --> 2878.78]  Or no, the perfect TV.
[2879.22 --> 2883.66]  Remember they did renders of like, it's a TV with a display port and this and that.
[2883.66 --> 2886.36]  And I was thinking, we should just do a whole series where we try to get these made.
[2886.36 --> 2891.32]  And I get my wishlist keyboard and someone else gets their wishlist headphones or whatever.
[2891.54 --> 2891.74]  Yeah.
[2893.02 --> 2893.38]  Yeah.
[2893.38 --> 2895.66]  Okay, so I want to find something.
[2895.76 --> 2897.44]  I think the easiest way to do this...
[2897.44 --> 2898.26]  Give me one second.
[2898.90 --> 2900.48]  Yeah, replace...
[2900.48 --> 2902.92]  If people are wondering where my wishlist keyboard is, let me tell you.
[2902.92 --> 2905.12]  Okay, so this keyboard...
[2905.12 --> 2906.12]  Oop, wrong screen.
[2906.54 --> 2908.14]  This keyboard...
[2908.14 --> 2909.10]  Um...
[2909.10 --> 2911.16]  Right here.
[2912.60 --> 2913.76]  Just blackbody keyboard.
[2913.94 --> 2915.28]  Those are custom keycaps.
[2915.40 --> 2916.92]  That was like a...
[2917.58 --> 2920.04]  They were Topor switches with a cherry stem.
[2920.42 --> 2924.94]  And I got custom keycaps for it to make like an LTT theme out of it.
[2925.16 --> 2926.42]  It was a really cool thing.
[2926.48 --> 2928.76]  And it was like the LTT keyboard for a little while.
[2928.84 --> 2929.14]  Okay.
[2929.20 --> 2931.10]  And we featured it in a bunch of videos and all this kind of stuff.
[2931.26 --> 2932.34]  I want V2.
[2932.72 --> 2933.12]  Okay.
[2933.14 --> 2934.00]  I don't want to do it.
[2934.06 --> 2934.66]  This is your can.
[2934.66 --> 2935.12]  I'll do it.
[2935.16 --> 2935.88]  Yeah, bring it on.
[2936.66 --> 2937.88]  How much does those cost?
[2938.10 --> 2939.04]  Oh, they can be pretty expensive.
[2939.60 --> 2940.62]  I saw like a kit.
[2940.74 --> 2941.64]  I was checking out Zilio.
[2942.06 --> 2942.78]  Is that how you pronounce those?
[2943.58 --> 2946.06]  Those is really popular in the keyboard enthusiast...
[2946.06 --> 2947.38]  I don't know how to pronounce anything, apparently.
[2948.76 --> 2949.74]  Maybe don't look at me.
[2949.74 --> 2949.90]  Yeah.
[2950.90 --> 2951.70]  Actually...
[2951.70 --> 2952.16]  Okay.
[2952.50 --> 2957.14]  In the keyboard enthusiast community right now, people are so amped on Zilio switches.
[2957.14 --> 2957.82]  Okay, yeah.
[2957.82 --> 2958.86]  It's kind of spelled like zealot.
[2959.02 --> 2961.10]  Like Z-E-A-L.
[2961.50 --> 2964.38]  And I was like, I need to get these for an upcoming video.
[2964.62 --> 2969.84]  Because I think what we're going to do is a blind test of what switches people actually like.
[2970.10 --> 2974.78]  We're going to try to have the same like backplate and keycaps and everything.
[2974.88 --> 2976.62]  And the only variable that changes is the switch.
[2976.94 --> 2978.14]  And we're going to set up like all of them.
[2978.44 --> 2979.06]  Romer Gs.
[2979.14 --> 2981.14]  People are always crapping on Logitech Romer Gs.
[2981.20 --> 2982.12]  We're going to have all the different cherries.
[2982.22 --> 2982.76]  We're going to have Kale.
[2982.80 --> 2984.02]  They have new things coming out.
[2984.02 --> 2984.36]  Yeah, yeah.
[2984.36 --> 2985.54]  I'm going to see if they want.
[2985.54 --> 2986.10]  Those are sick too.
[2986.10 --> 2989.50]  Maybe they'll be interested and we'll get those new Logitech keyswitches that have just
[2989.50 --> 2989.78]  come out.
[2989.86 --> 2992.06]  We'll have the Zilios in there and some other enthusiast ones.
[2992.32 --> 2993.40]  And we'll just have a bunch.
[2993.98 --> 2995.56]  And people will, they won't know what they are.
[2995.70 --> 2996.86]  And they'll just rank them.
[2997.32 --> 3001.22]  I think to do that, I've seen a lot of keyboard blind tests.
[3001.70 --> 3006.00]  And the last one, Lance and I did, which I think was like a year ago or more.
[3006.00 --> 3011.14]  He brought me down randomly and it was like a terrible keyboard.
[3011.14 --> 3011.86]  I think it was Cooler Master.
[3011.96 --> 3012.36]  Sorry, guys.
[3012.42 --> 3013.70]  But still, it was really bad.
[3013.88 --> 3015.98]  And it was like a fake mechanical switch or something.
[3016.10 --> 3016.50]  And it was terrible.
[3016.50 --> 3017.14]  Oh, yeah.
[3017.54 --> 3019.50]  And then they had like a real mechanical switch.
[3019.74 --> 3021.34]  And like immediately, it's like, okay, obviously.
[3021.80 --> 3027.44]  But when they're kind of close and they're all really good switches, I think just like
[3027.44 --> 3029.66]  set them free and let them take their time.
[3029.96 --> 3031.14]  Because sometimes it's hard.
[3031.50 --> 3031.64]  Yeah.
[3031.74 --> 3032.88]  It's exactly what I was thinking.
[3033.12 --> 3033.26]  Yeah.
[3033.32 --> 3035.44]  I didn't want to have like, because we did one the other day here.
[3035.58 --> 3037.12]  It was a Cherry versus Kale.
[3037.68 --> 3038.24]  Spoiler alert.
[3038.92 --> 3039.90]  Nobody got it.
[3040.16 --> 3041.16]  Not one person.
[3042.40 --> 3043.06]  That's actually pretty cool.
[3043.06 --> 3044.50]  But you know why, right?
[3045.36 --> 3047.68]  Cherry's manufacturing processes went into public domain.
[3047.88 --> 3049.08]  And the Kale just copied them.
[3049.32 --> 3050.34]  So they're like the same thing.
[3050.52 --> 3050.88]  That's good.
[3051.06 --> 3051.20]  Yeah.
[3051.60 --> 3055.12]  Well, I guess someone would argue that Cherry's are more durable.
[3055.50 --> 3057.04]  They're going to last for more million clicks.
[3057.94 --> 3058.98]  But, yeah.
[3059.22 --> 3062.10]  I've never had a switch from either of them die on me.
[3062.26 --> 3064.02]  So like, good job to both of you.
[3064.14 --> 3067.16]  I'm still using the same Cherry-based keyboard.
[3067.26 --> 3068.22]  And I type a lot.
[3068.30 --> 3070.18]  And I'm always on my freaking computer.
[3070.56 --> 3071.92]  That's why my back screwed up.
[3072.02 --> 3072.28]  Hooray.
[3073.06 --> 3078.68]  But I have the same one from like 2009.
[3080.70 --> 3081.86]  All the switches are fine.
[3082.16 --> 3082.74]  Like, I don't know.
[3082.88 --> 3082.98]  Yeah.
[3083.16 --> 3083.68]  I want to custom.
[3083.80 --> 3085.94]  Anyway, I was going to say, I was on their website for Zelio.
[3086.02 --> 3089.10]  And they had like these kits that you get where you get the back plate.
[3089.58 --> 3091.90]  And you have to buy switches to put it in everything.
[3092.36 --> 3093.26]  And it was still $600.
[3093.90 --> 3095.40]  I was like, what?
[3095.72 --> 3096.70]  What is this hobby?
[3097.56 --> 3099.86]  It's, there's wildly expensive keyboards.
[3099.86 --> 3102.96]  Like, one of the guys I'm talking about.
[3102.96 --> 3104.70]  He's got a YouTube channel and a Twitch page.
[3105.16 --> 3105.68]  I'm trying to find his.
[3105.82 --> 3107.20]  I'm going to butcher his name.
[3107.26 --> 3108.38]  But I think it's Taya Types.
[3108.54 --> 3110.56]  It's T-A-E.
[3111.60 --> 3113.32]  There's such nice stuff out there.
[3113.96 --> 3115.82]  T-A-E-H-A Types.
[3115.82 --> 3120.08]  He made Scarra's keyboard and a few other big time streamers keyboards.
[3120.44 --> 3126.30]  And I think he worked with like Random Frank P and a few other big YouTubers working with keyboards with those guys.
[3127.58 --> 3129.42]  And their stuff looks super cool.
[3129.96 --> 3130.18]  What's up?
[3130.18 --> 3130.82]  Yeah, we should have more.
[3130.88 --> 3131.52]  Making a keyboard?
[3131.74 --> 3132.04]  Yeah.
[3132.46 --> 3134.00]  Well, we did a video about that last year.
[3134.96 --> 3135.92]  A custom one?
[3136.68 --> 3136.96]  What?
[3137.22 --> 3138.58]  Anthony and Linus did it last year.
[3138.58 --> 3139.44]  What was it called?
[3139.54 --> 3141.10]  Me and Luke didn't see that video.
[3141.10 --> 3142.84]  A custom keyboard or something like that.
[3142.92 --> 3144.22]  And we're going to do another one at some point.
[3144.34 --> 3146.26]  Yeah, we're making an all metal one soon.
[3146.32 --> 3146.84]  Yeah, I think so.
[3147.02 --> 3149.12]  I think one of the new people is doing that.
[3149.18 --> 3150.14]  How did you do a custom keyboard?
[3150.24 --> 3151.06]  Did I just miss this?
[3151.44 --> 3153.56]  Can you build your own mechanical keyboard?
[3154.22 --> 3154.48]  Wow.
[3155.00 --> 3155.40]  Wow.
[3155.56 --> 3156.36]  Way to know our catalog.
[3156.36 --> 3156.76]  Wow.
[3157.76 --> 3158.08]  Wow.
[3158.78 --> 3159.10]  Sorry.
[3159.10 --> 3160.38]  It even got over 2 million views.
[3161.82 --> 3162.22]  Lol.
[3162.74 --> 3165.30]  Not all of us get to review every single video, Nick.
[3165.50 --> 3167.18]  Okay, how custom did they do it?
[3167.80 --> 3168.08]  Okay.
[3169.00 --> 3170.74]  Everybody go and watch that video right now.
[3170.82 --> 3172.34]  I want 3 million views by Monday.
[3172.58 --> 3172.92]  Yeah.
[3174.06 --> 3175.56]  Oh, that looks pretty custom.
[3176.20 --> 3177.20]  It's custom AF, bro.
[3177.46 --> 3178.56]  Did they just buy a kit, though?
[3178.82 --> 3184.66]  Because the current dudes that are doing custom are, like, getting their own bodies made and, like, all this stuff.
[3184.68 --> 3185.36]  Yeah, they didn't do that.
[3185.44 --> 3185.90]  Yeah, okay.
[3186.26 --> 3186.42]  Yeah.
[3186.42 --> 3186.64]  Yeah.
[3186.74 --> 3186.98]  Yeah.
[3187.22 --> 3187.78]  We knew this.
[3187.92 --> 3188.42]  Yeah, we knew that.
[3188.50 --> 3189.76]  We're talking customer.
[3189.90 --> 3190.56]  I want beyond.
[3190.56 --> 3191.34]  A whole workshop.
[3191.66 --> 3192.30]  No, exactly.
[3192.54 --> 3193.88]  That's why I'm bringing it up now.
[3194.00 --> 3197.18]  It's because, like, I'm talking beyond the, like, mass drop kit.
[3197.18 --> 3197.26]  Yeah.
[3197.36 --> 3198.22]  Which is super cool.
[3198.50 --> 3200.60]  And if you want to do a keyboard that way, that's awesome.
[3200.62 --> 3201.62]  I want a whole new alphabet, man.
[3201.68 --> 3202.90]  Letters you've never seen.
[3204.02 --> 3205.04]  A whole new punctuation.
[3205.16 --> 3205.84]  Enterobangs.
[3207.34 --> 3208.46]  You know the Enterobang?
[3208.74 --> 3209.00]  Yeah.
[3209.16 --> 3209.40]  Okay.
[3210.18 --> 3210.94]  You know about that?
[3211.36 --> 3212.30]  Yeah, I do.
[3213.30 --> 3213.92]  I do.
[3213.92 --> 3214.48]  Thank you.
[3215.10 --> 3215.46]  Well.
[3215.68 --> 3216.66]  Anyways, I think that's it for the show.
[3216.66 --> 3217.54]  Do we miss anything, Nick?
[3217.74 --> 3217.98]  No.
[3218.40 --> 3218.72]  Okay.
[3218.82 --> 3220.08]  Do you guys like those jackets?
[3220.08 --> 3220.76]  I do.
[3221.06 --> 3221.58]  Yeah, they're nice.
[3221.66 --> 3222.00]  They're nice.
[3222.18 --> 3223.44]  I like the hybrid nature.
[3223.58 --> 3224.30]  They're like my shorts.
[3224.66 --> 3224.76]  Yeah.
[3224.76 --> 3225.94]  Or there's the, yeah.
[3226.14 --> 3227.18]  I feel empowered in it.
[3227.74 --> 3227.98]  Cool.
[3228.82 --> 3230.26]  Seriously, I feel like I'm a superhero.
[3230.44 --> 3231.40]  You definitely look like a superhero.
[3231.78 --> 3231.98]  Yeah.
[3232.06 --> 3234.90]  It goes along with the comic books thing that we've got going on.
[3235.14 --> 3236.22]  This will be great in the fall.
[3236.30 --> 3238.58]  I'm really warm right now, but this looks like.
[3238.58 --> 3241.34]  Yeah, under studio lights, it's a little warm, but that's sort of the point, I think.
[3241.92 --> 3242.24]  Oh, yeah.
[3242.50 --> 3242.96]  So, like.
[3243.06 --> 3243.74]  It's supposed to be warm.
[3243.74 --> 3245.30]  A lot of people picking them up, so.
[3245.50 --> 3246.00]  Oh, really?
[3246.00 --> 3246.36]  Yeah.
[3246.52 --> 3246.76]  Guys.
[3247.12 --> 3248.72]  We sell all this stuff fast.
[3248.72 --> 3248.90]  Swag it.
[3249.40 --> 3250.20]  We sell it fast.
[3250.96 --> 3251.14]  Yeah.
[3251.18 --> 3251.76]  We sell it fast.
[3251.78 --> 3253.98]  And we didn't order that many of this, so, like.
[3254.24 --> 3255.76]  If you don't want to wait, like, six months.
[3256.44 --> 3256.76]  Yeah.

[3258.02 --> 3258.22]  Yeah.

[3258.56 --> 3258.84]  Yeah.
[3258.84 --> 3260.78]  They have to do restocking stuff, like, actually.
[3261.00 --> 3263.76]  So, like, if they run out of your size and stuff, they'll have to restock, and that will
[3263.76 --> 3264.48]  probably take a while.
[3264.48 --> 3266.62]  It's because everything that we make, basically, is custom.
[3266.84 --> 3267.06]  Yeah.
[3267.16 --> 3268.76]  Like, this was designed custom.
[3268.90 --> 3269.12]  Yeah.
[3269.58 --> 3271.72]  In partnership with a garment manufacturer.
[3271.92 --> 3272.14]  Yeah.
[3272.62 --> 3277.18]  Like, it's not like we're just like, oh, order this, like, random A1 model.
[3277.44 --> 3277.56]  No.
[3277.56 --> 3280.14]  It's like, we make it from ground up, so.
[3280.26 --> 3281.40]  It takes a while to restock.
[3281.40 --> 3284.58]  These guys are, like, sending emails to Pakistan and stuff, guys.
[3284.72 --> 3284.84]  Like.

[3296.38 --> 3296.82]  Okay.

[3301.56 --> 3301.88]  Oops.

[3302.98 --> 3303.64]  There we go.
[3304.36 --> 3304.90]  In a boat.
[3306.12 --> 3306.54]  Ah.
[3307.06 --> 3307.48]  I'm dead.

[3315.94 --> 3316.60]  Not gonna lie.
[3316.98 --> 3317.26]  Wow.

[3329.56 --> 3330.06]  It's so fun.
[3330.10 --> 3330.64]  That was amazing.
[3330.74 --> 3331.30]  Let's try it easy again.
[3331.70 --> 3332.90]  Comic garage.
[3334.90 --> 3335.60]  We failed.
