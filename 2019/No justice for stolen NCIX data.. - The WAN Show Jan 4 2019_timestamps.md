[2019-01-09T01:14:48Z] Video: No justice for stolen NCIX data.. - The WAN Show Jan 4 2019 
Um... so... i went to the link you said to go to luke at the 432 seconds timestamp in this video...went where that told me to go, but there no subscription showing there to cancel/migrate...

so i doublechecked the floatplane site and my subscription and invoices do show up there...

does that mean you all already migrated me and i dont have to do anything?

also, site continues to look great so far.

also when will the google connection/sign in option stop being greyed out? you have that newfangled discord thingy enabled to connect to the floatplane site but not google for some reason?

so frustrating people always link to facebook or twitter or now this strange discord thingy none of which i use

and no one ever links to google google plus google hangouts yahoo messenger or email back when i used that ((strangely around the time yahoo had its breach and was bought by verizon suddenly some websites were offereing it as a connection option instead of when it was actually still used and popular...i guess bc of the weird newfangled yahoo account key thing i dont understand very well or something)) but yeah i like those and msn, and i use steam bc of you all using steam and my friend pushing it at around the same time.  also use skype and have a microsoft account.  those would make sense to add.  the tech industry may like apple and paypal and facebook and twitter to death but most people i know dont use any of those or care much really.
