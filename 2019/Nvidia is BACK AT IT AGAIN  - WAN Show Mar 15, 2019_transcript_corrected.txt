[0.00 → 0.58] What the heck is this?
[2.38 → 3.68] It's a WAN show!
[4.08 → 5.14] And we're live!
[5.36 → 5.70] Yeah!
[6.04 → 9.94] Hey guys, it's time for the WAN show!
[10.68 → 11.08] Yeah!
[11.48 → 15.68] We actually have a lot of great news topics for you guys today.
[16.56 → 17.14] Six.
[17.86 → 21.84] Of which we might cover two or three of them.
[22.10 → 22.20] Some.
[22.64 → 24.60] Yeah, we'll definitely cover a couple of them.
[24.60 → 30.08] The most important news topic I have though is that I am taking a real vacation.
[30.80 → 31.92] No, you're not.
[32.00 → 35.88] No, no, well, I mean, no, I will still be...
[35.88 → 41.48] You will be taking real vacation time, and you will not be working at Linus Media Group.
[42.12 → 42.52] Yes.
[42.80 → 44.12] But it's not really a vacation.
[45.10 → 47.18] I have a bone to pick with you on the vacation terminology.
[47.18 → 48.04] Now, hold on a minute.
[48.20 → 49.54] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[49.56 → 51.58] Okay, so are we really going to get into this?
[51.72 → 51.92] Like, right?
[52.02 → 52.38] Sure.
[52.38 → 53.70] No, forget it.
[53.70 → 54.66] You got to roll the intro?
[54.72 → 55.72] No, I'm rolling the intro.
[56.14 → 58.16] It took us half an hour to roll the intro last time.
[58.16 → 59.08] We're not doing that again.
[59.18 → 59.38] Okay, okay, okay.
[64.82 → 66.62] I think that's BS.
[67.12 → 67.48] What?
[67.86 → 68.64] Full disagree.
[68.92 → 69.42] Full disagree.
[69.52 → 70.92] Look, we'll talk about this later.
[76.26 → 77.70] Ten of ten disagree.
[78.66 → 79.46] Oh my God.
[79.88 → 80.18] Okay.
[81.54 → 82.80] So, look.
[83.70 → 85.60] I'm going to let you finish.
[85.70 → 86.32] So, go ahead.
[87.24 → 88.90] I just, I don't think it's a vacation.
[89.04 → 90.02] What are you going to, so, okay.
[90.14 → 92.20] Tell them what you're going to do with your time off.
[92.22 → 93.00] Okay, so.
[93.48 → 96.08] With your time off to be, to be like super.
[96.08 → 96.60] My vacation.
[96.88 → 98.30] You're super clear on that.
[98.30 → 101.58] Okay, so, from Monday to Friday of next week.
[101.68 → 101.98] Okay.
[101.98 → 106.72] I am not going to be at the office.
[106.84 → 107.48] Yeah, time off.
[107.60 → 107.68] Yeah.
[108.90 → 109.30] Vacation.
[110.58 → 112.28] Because I will be on vacation.
[113.60 → 114.04] And I am.
[114.04 → 114.62] You're taking vacation time.
[114.62 → 114.96] Probably.
[115.96 → 117.04] I'm, probably.
[118.16 → 118.44] Okay.
[118.56 → 127.60] So, I plan to spend a few days reorganizing my garage and my attic and going furniture shopping
[127.60 → 129.28] for my kids' room.
[129.62 → 129.90] Yeah.
[129.90 → 130.80] Um.
[131.88 → 133.08] That sounds super exciting.
[133.64 → 133.98] Yes.
[134.20 → 134.70] Well, no.
[134.76 → 135.80] It's not exciting.
[136.02 → 138.82] But I'm excited because I'm going to be on vacation.
[139.62 → 141.88] Why are you making me self-conscious about this?
[142.74 → 144.68] Why are you self-conscious about it?
[144.96 → 146.90] That's a question for yourself, I think.
[146.90 → 148.16] Well, no, no, no, no, no.
[148.60 → 148.90] No, no.
[149.02 → 149.98] You are.
[149.98 → 158.34] I didn't realize this was going to affect you so much.
[158.36 → 159.46] What is the difference?
[159.74 → 160.24] Because you were.
[160.34 → 160.62] You were.
[160.72 → 163.52] So, you were so happy that it was your first vacation.
[164.02 → 164.32] Yeah.
[164.82 → 165.44] But that.
[165.56 → 166.88] See, that's not the point, though.
[166.94 → 167.76] Like, when I say first.
[167.84 → 168.76] Like, look.
[169.02 → 169.98] It's vacation time.
[170.00 → 172.66] I travel all around the world all the time.
[173.24 → 175.40] That is not a vacation.
[176.68 → 177.08] Vacation.
[177.22 → 177.34] Okay.
[177.44 → 177.98] Tell you what.
[178.16 → 178.64] That's fair.
[178.64 → 180.54] But none of that is vacation.
[180.72 → 181.40] Do me this.
[181.40 → 182.76] Do me this kindness.
[183.08 → 183.18] Okay.
[183.58 → 183.76] Okay.
[183.86 → 190.20] Google vacation while I explain why travelling is not, to me, a vacation.
[190.64 → 194.80] Because when I travel, it increases my anxiety.
[195.44 → 203.70] It decreases the likelihood that I will be able to actually go places that I want to go and do things that I want to do.
[204.34 → 207.22] It's interesting because it doesn't say anything about decreasing anxiety or anything.
[208.64 → 211.40] Well, Luke, why don't you tell us.
[211.40 → 218.08] It does specifically say an extended period of leisure and recreation, which is not what it sounds like you're doing.
[218.08 → 218.36] Okay.
[218.52 → 220.04] Well, hold on a second.
[220.04 → 224.52] So I plan to play badminton twice that week instead of once.
[224.96 → 225.20] Okay.
[225.26 → 226.36] That is true.
[226.36 → 228.88] That is perhaps not leisure.
[229.00 → 229.66] I will give you that.
[229.90 → 231.42] But definitely recreation.
[231.42 → 231.68] Recreation.
[231.80 → 232.08] Yeah, yeah.
[232.08 → 232.80] Definitely recreation.
[232.80 → 233.52] You're 100% in there.
[233.52 → 241.18] Also, I am definitely like 9 of 10 re-addicted to 1602 AD right now.
[241.20 → 242.28] And I plan to play that.
[242.40 → 243.40] Can you put it back up for a sec?
[243.58 → 244.74] Yeah, I'll put it back up.
[245.16 → 245.80] Oh, wow.
[245.80 → 250.68] Especially one spent away from home.
[250.68 → 255.22] So it doesn't have to be, but it specifically says leisure or recreation.
[255.40 → 257.72] And you are planning on reorganizing your garage.
[257.74 → 258.12] Also.
[258.36 → 259.10] And cleaning your attic.
[259.10 → 260.64] Definition number two.
[261.08 → 261.80] Definition number two.
[261.88 → 265.16] The action of leaving something one previously occupied.
[265.84 → 268.26] I don't think most people use it that way.
[268.28 → 268.50] No.
[269.56 → 271.58] That's going to be a little difficult.
[272.80 → 274.20] We're going to leave that alone.
[274.62 → 274.78] Okay.
[274.96 → 277.14] Andre D from Float plane Chat.
[277.48 → 278.52] I'm with Linus.
[278.62 → 282.00] Anytime away from work is vacation if normally you'd be working.
[282.40 → 284.94] And then it replaces the need to do work.
[285.34 → 286.00] Hold on a second.
[286.00 → 288.92] I take vacation and mow the lawn.
[289.10 → 289.86] Yak now.
[290.12 → 290.76] Oh, you know.
[291.42 → 292.24] Yak now.
[292.42 → 293.36] I misread that.
[294.08 → 295.56] Is that relaxing for you, though?
[296.76 → 298.52] Some people enjoy yard work.
[298.76 → 301.34] Smelling freshly cut grass is like a thing.
[301.42 → 304.54] I don't think you're reorganizing the garage or the attic is going to be relaxing for you.
[304.56 → 306.34] It will be relaxing when it is done.
[306.58 → 312.18] Because right now my house is in such a state that I actually cannot relax in it.
[312.18 → 317.38] So you're like using your vacation time to buy relaxation ongoing in the future.
[317.38 → 318.90] It's like an investment.
[319.40 → 320.48] Vacation investment.
[320.92 → 321.06] Okay.
[321.20 → 327.12] But the reason that I'm calling this my first true vacation since starting Linus Media Group
[327.12 → 334.82] is that for the first time I am not going to be the one to bank up the content beforehand
[334.82 → 338.34] or make up the content when I get back.
[338.74 → 339.76] So do you know about this?
[339.82 → 340.44] Have you heard about this?
[340.64 → 340.86] Yeah.
[340.86 → 354.68] So Riley, James, Anthony, Alex, and Jake are all going to be working together to produce six LTT videos
[354.68 → 359.78] plus the usually scheduled Tech Linked episodes while I am gone.
[363.64 → 370.62] So theoretically, I will be away for a week with no stress and nobody will call me on my cellular telephone.
[370.62 → 373.30] And I will not get any emails.
[374.08 → 375.34] And I am really looking forward to it.
[375.34 → 377.94] I'm going to set calendar reminders to call you about float plane stuff.
[379.26 → 381.02] You don't even need a calendar reminder.
[381.14 → 382.56] Every time I walk past you.
[382.64 → 383.76] Like, hey, hey, uh.
[384.28 → 384.64] Hey.
[386.24 → 386.68] Hey.
[386.68 → 386.76] Hey.
[386.90 → 391.62] You know that six months when we like didn't put anything live on the website?
[391.86 → 393.30] I'm making up for it now.
[393.58 → 395.48] We just, hey, we created a new feature.
[395.56 → 396.76] Actually, you should show that.
[396.76 → 398.34] That is very cool.
[398.36 → 402.34] We actually not have, but we at least have a mock-up.
[402.46 → 403.28] Like, this is on the pre-prod server, right?
[403.28 → 404.26] I'm getting it's going to be difficult.
[404.88 → 407.44] I believe it's on Yuki's local environment.
[407.72 → 408.00] Oh.
[408.92 → 409.32] Okay.
[409.46 → 410.42] So this will be a while.
[411.14 → 412.46] Probably not, actually.
[412.54 → 412.66] No.
[412.74 → 414.54] We're making no promises because that's...
[414.54 → 415.66] We're definitely making no promises.
[415.66 → 416.96] That's what's best for Luke.
[417.10 → 417.30] Yes.
[417.32 → 418.06] No promises.
[418.48 → 419.08] Hey, Luke.
[419.94 → 421.42] The roast is not today.
[421.72 → 423.68] When are we going to have two-factor authentication?
[425.38 → 426.16] Six weeks?
[426.76 → 427.76] Six weeks go by.
[427.92 → 428.28] Hey, Luke.
[428.32 → 429.64] When are we going to have two-factor authentication?
[430.96 → 431.56] I don't know.
[431.62 → 432.16] Six weeks?
[432.58 → 439.56] It's like he lives on a different space-time continuum than everyone else where it just
[439.56 → 440.32] holds still.
[440.40 → 440.58] Anyway.
[440.74 → 442.10] No, I'm just teasing you because...
[442.10 → 442.76] And I can now.
[443.00 → 446.96] Because actually, we're rolling out new stuff every other week right now.
[447.02 → 447.14] Okay.
[447.14 → 448.46] So I'm going to switch over to your screen.
[448.80 → 449.88] So this is pretty sick.
[450.38 → 450.86] I think...
[450.86 → 451.10] Hold on.
[451.14 → 451.34] Hold on.
[451.42 → 451.50] Hold on.
[451.50 → 452.30] I think...
[452.30 → 454.68] And obviously, I'm a little biased here.
[454.96 → 457.68] But I think this looks better than YouTube's theatre mode.
[457.68 → 460.26] I think this is the best theatre mode I've personally ever seen.
[460.58 → 460.76] Okay.
[460.92 → 461.32] Straight up.
[461.32 → 466.08] So the chunkiness in the video, by the way, is rapid pausing to show how different things
[466.08 → 466.58] get affected.
[466.58 → 468.30] Don't worry about the chunkiness in the video.
[469.74 → 470.18] Dang!
[470.84 → 471.16] Ooh!
[472.96 → 473.88] Isn't that pretty?
[475.02 → 476.30] It's so smooth.
[476.38 → 480.46] Full dark mode, but you can still see the original thumbnail, the title, and all that information.
[480.46 → 484.36] Your comments come over to the side so you can still chat about the video live.
[484.60 → 485.18] Isn't that cool?
[485.28 → 486.24] I think that's really sick.
[486.34 → 488.76] There's a download button so you can still interact with it.
[488.94 → 490.50] Like, you don't lose a lot of your features.
[490.60 → 491.48] You can still see the description.
[491.76 → 494.72] So if someone says click a link in the description, you don't have to leave theatre mode.
[494.72 → 496.62] You don't have to leave theatre mode to comment.
[496.62 → 502.04] I mean, honestly, that's one of the things that I really like when I'm watching a video
[502.04 → 503.42] is actually reading the comments.
[503.52 → 504.28] Oh, do you need me to move that?
[504.66 → 506.34] Just in the...
[506.34 → 506.72] Oh, sure.
[507.08 → 509.22] Reading the comments while I'm watching it.
[509.34 → 513.46] So having something that's just off to the side, full dark mode, really nice, really clean.
[513.80 → 515.28] I think it looks fantastic.
[515.66 → 515.84] Yeah.
[516.58 → 517.34] It looks awesome.
[517.68 → 519.16] There's also tons of other stuff coming on the way.
[519.50 → 519.90] Searches.
[520.04 → 520.60] Searches coming on the way.
[520.60 → 521.76] People are like, give me now.
[521.98 → 522.46] Like, look.
[522.90 → 523.50] Trust me.
[523.50 → 527.30] If that approach worked, there are all kinds of stuff we have now.
[528.80 → 529.58] It doesn't.
[530.44 → 533.48] We tried that at one time, and then we had to spend a really long time undoing that.
[534.10 → 535.34] Now we're in a good spot.
[536.44 → 540.94] Search is coming on as, like, really close, as I believe I've talked about before.
[541.42 → 541.78] Transcoding?
[543.10 → 543.78] Peter's here?
[545.24 → 548.78] I'm not going to give dates, but, like, real soon.
[549.20 → 550.96] It's been a really long time coming.
[552.40 → 553.30] But real soon.
[553.30 → 556.28] Rod from BS Mods says, wow, did Linus start on tigerish?
[556.74 → 557.10] No, no.
[557.18 → 558.32] We were half an hour late.
[558.44 → 559.96] We just started, like, ten minutes ago.
[560.02 → 560.22] Yeah.
[560.58 → 561.78] Which, I'm very sorry.
[561.88 → 562.04] Anyway.
[562.16 → 564.80] Oh, he thinks we're on time for 4.30.
[566.20 → 566.48] Right.
[567.34 → 569.10] Daylight savings time.
[569.32 → 569.52] Yeah.
[569.52 → 569.92] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[569.92 → 570.30] Yeah.
[570.96 → 572.04] So about that.
[572.12 → 572.40] No.
[572.40 → 574.50] So that there was a time change over here.
[574.68 → 576.04] So actually, that's great.
[576.28 → 577.44] For a lot of the world.
[577.44 → 578.12] We were early.
[578.12 → 579.44] We were early today.
[581.06 → 581.82] Oh, my goodness.
[581.84 → 582.78] Oh, that's terrific.
[583.06 → 584.02] That's actually fantastic.
[584.10 → 584.24] Yeah.
[584.24 → 584.48] Wow, great.
[584.88 → 585.18] All right.
[585.26 → 585.82] So you know what?
[585.88 → 588.16] Why don't we actually do a tech topic here?
[588.32 → 589.14] Why don't we do a tech topic?
[591.74 → 592.96] 120 FPS of the movies?
[593.48 → 593.74] No.
[593.94 → 594.66] Let's get the title one out of the way.
[594.66 → 595.84] Let's get the title one out of the way.
[595.96 → 596.02] Yeah.
[596.02 → 596.66] You know what?
[597.66 → 599.06] That's my New Year's resolution.
[599.46 → 600.36] I'm 100%.
[600.36 → 601.68] New Year's resolution, 8K.
[601.86 → 603.06] I love how it's happening now.
[603.26 → 604.06] Yeah, shut up.
[604.88 → 607.46] Look, some of us are so great already.
[607.60 → 608.88] It's the vacation of New Year's resolutions.
[609.02 → 613.68] Some of us are so great already, it takes us a few months to come up with a New Year's resolution.
[614.60 → 621.36] You know, I get a kick out of this because so many people, I saw on the live stream that I did today,
[621.58 → 625.34] where I was going around and talking to the writers about what they had planned for while I was gone.
[625.60 → 625.82] Okay.
[625.82 → 634.54] I saw so many comments about, like, you know, oh, you know, Linus is being so nice to his staff.
[634.62 → 635.50] Like, what's wrong?
[635.58 → 640.62] He's, like, talking to them so respectfully and, like, interacting with them like a normal human.
[641.20 → 652.14] And I'm just kind of sitting here going, like, yeah, obviously the egomaniac, like, you know, James T. Kirk character that I play,
[652.14 → 655.40] it's, like, it's hammed up for the camera.
[655.40 → 658.50] Honestly, honestly, I like myself.
[658.66 → 659.82] I do like myself.
[659.96 → 663.02] I'm not, like, a self-hating person or anything like that.
[663.20 → 670.92] But the whole, like, yeah, I'm so great that it takes me two and a half months, in spite of how incredibly intelligent I am,
[671.08 → 673.06] to come up with a New Year's resolution.
[674.28 → 675.64] It's just funny.
[675.64 → 678.70] It's just hilarious.
[678.70 → 679.72] I think it's funny.
[679.90 → 680.08] So.
[680.46 → 682.42] I think everyone here does, too.
[682.56 → 688.64] I can understand how it might be difficult as an audience member, considering I've had family members worry about this.
[688.70 → 688.98] Really?
[689.44 → 690.40] My grandpa.
[690.98 → 691.30] Remember?
[692.08 → 692.48] Yeah.
[692.48 → 692.88] Yeah.
[692.88 → 694.46] He went a little over the top, though.
[694.46 → 694.86] Yeah.
[694.94 → 695.72] That was a little different.
[696.20 → 698.46] I was definitely threatened with a knife.
[698.82 → 699.16] Yeah.
[699.38 → 699.82] Yeah.
[700.02 → 700.38] Yeah.
[700.38 → 701.56] For an extended period of time.
[701.72 → 703.18] Luke was like, no, it's fine.
[704.88 → 705.50] Don't worry.
[705.54 → 706.64] He's very nice to me.
[707.00 → 708.42] Everything's actually okay.
[709.72 → 713.78] But there's, like, there's ribbing between friends.
[713.78 → 722.00] And I think when you've worked together for a long time, and you understand, you get give and take.
[722.18 → 725.48] So you'll get, like, grandiose praise, and you'll get ribbed for stuff.
[725.82 → 726.00] Yeah.
[726.30 → 727.56] And it's, everything's fine.
[727.72 → 728.40] You know, it's funny.
[728.50 → 733.06] During the Linus Reads Me in comments, there was, we ended up with a thread on the forum.
[733.06 → 734.36] Did you see the thread on the forum?
[734.58 → 734.84] Yeah.
[734.84 → 747.48] So we ended up with a thread on the forum that was, like, full tinfoil hat that because everyone laughed during, I think it was a comment about what a hopeless narcissist I am or something like that.
[747.60 → 749.96] And someone in the background was like, yup.
[750.24 → 752.64] Or, like, they laugh or something like that.
[752.68 → 760.26] They were like, this is them, like, reaching out that they are in a hostile, abusive work environment.
[760.26 → 765.10] And I'm kind of sitting here going, do you have any idea how talented these people are?
[765.38 → 768.80] If they didn't want to be here, they wouldn't be here.
[769.34 → 771.40] Nobody has to work here.
[771.86 → 773.54] No one's at gunpoint.
[774.02 → 774.76] That's kind of true.
[775.00 → 781.32] Like, we actually have a really great job market here in Vancouver, particularly in the media production industry.
[781.32 → 795.86] Like, if someone like Baron decided he didn't feel like working for the monsters that are Linus Sebastian and Yvonne Ho and Linus Media Group Incorporated, evil corporate entity that it is, you don't think he can get a job?
[796.72 → 798.14] Like, come on.
[798.14 → 812.26] I mean, consider that a lot of people that work here dropped more, like, traditionally better jobs to come work here when times were, like, not as good.
[813.06 → 815.78] And then they're still here way, way, way, way, way later.
[816.24 → 817.60] I think there's probably a reason.
[817.82 → 819.00] Like, we're trying to do better.
[819.00 → 831.18] I mean, the thing for me is that I actually don't really like going out of my way to talk about the things that are great about working at Linus Media Group.
[831.42 → 836.08] Because, and I had, this was another, like, really, I don't know what to call it.
[836.12 → 843.18] Crazy, hurtful, bizarre, understandable, and yet everything is working exactly as intended.
[843.32 → 844.12] Thank you for that.
[845.28 → 845.56] There.
[845.72 → 847.90] That's my emotion cloud.
[847.90 → 848.60] That was a lot.
[848.92 → 853.28] Anyway, there was a comment on the 10-year anniversary live stream that Yvonne and I did.
[853.34 → 854.20] Did you watch any of that?
[854.40 → 854.56] Uh-huh.
[854.70 → 855.34] I watched the whole thing.
[855.60 → 856.22] Oh, of course you did.
[856.30 → 856.46] Okay.
[856.56 → 869.64] So when we talked about people starting at the bottom and how we don't offer, like, gigantic mono salaries because what we're looking for is, in fact, I don't even think we mentioned that part because it was more true at the beginning.
[870.08 → 876.48] Anyway, we mentioned that our expectation is that the people who work here would do it for nothing.
[876.48 → 880.64] And we're not saying that they do it for nothing.
[880.64 → 883.98] We're just saying that they would do it for nothing.
[883.98 → 893.06] Because when we hire, we are trying to hire passion first, attitude first, and then, you know what?
[893.34 → 895.00] We can work on all the other stuff.
[895.50 → 895.68] Yeah.
[895.68 → 902.70] Because if you're passionate, and you have a good attitude, then, you know, you get a bunch of people like that in a room.
[902.92 → 904.48] That's when things happen.
[905.08 → 914.14] And so someone interpreted that to mean that we basically pay slave wages, and they were like, I'm glad they mentioned that.
[914.22 → 916.42] That really reveals a lot about them as an employer.
[916.62 → 917.92] I would never work there.
[917.92 → 918.00] Okay.
[918.88 → 922.00] Then everything's working exactly the way it's supposed to.
[923.60 → 923.96] Perfect.
[925.64 → 928.34] We were a match not made in heaven.
[928.80 → 928.92] Yeah.
[929.06 → 932.20] If you remember, what was it, one or two streams ago?
[932.74 → 936.24] You talked about, well, I'm saying you as in them, and then now I'm talking to you.
[936.30 → 937.00] That got a little confusing.
[937.14 → 944.82] But if they remember, as of one or two streams ago, we talked about how all the original members now own houses of some form.
[945.64 → 946.00] Domiciles.
[946.00 → 947.36] Yeah, let's go with that.
[947.52 → 948.66] Because they're actually quite varied.
[949.00 → 949.06] Yeah.
[950.56 → 952.40] I think it's okay.
[953.80 → 955.36] I just, you know.
[956.38 → 957.26] So here's the thing.
[957.26 → 958.64] We're happy with you not applying.
[958.90 → 961.22] I actually blame you for part of this perception.
[961.76 → 966.52] Because you used to complain about your compensation on camera a fair bit.
[966.72 → 967.98] But see, here's the thing.
[967.98 → 977.78] He knows that that's a sensitive spot for me because I actually do care about making Linus Media Group a place that makes sense for people to work.
[977.90 → 979.00] I want to be a real company.
[979.40 → 980.60] You know, like that kind of thing.
[980.60 → 983.40] And he would rib me for two reasons.
[983.60 → 986.28] One is that he knew that it cut me pretty deep.
[986.72 → 996.46] And two, in the early days, I'm pretty sure Luke, in the very earliest days, was actually making less than legal minimum wage.
[996.46 → 997.50] Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[997.64 → 998.42] It was, okay.
[998.82 → 1003.24] But I also rib you for it because you know my real stance on it quite well.
[1003.24 → 1007.06] But that's exactly the point of ribbing.
[1007.16 → 1010.12] This is very important when you're viewing these things.
[1010.30 → 1013.92] It's like Linus and I have talked about this stuff extensively off camera, and he knows my real stance on it.
[1013.94 → 1016.02] My real stance on it is that it's completely fine.
[1016.06 → 1024.14] We literally have a scheduled annual discussion called the Annual Employee Review here where we talk about how everything's going and talk about compensation and all that stuff.
[1024.42 → 1028.14] Because we don't want all the time to be about that.
[1028.14 → 1033.38] We want every day to be about going to work and being passionate and doing what we're excited to do.
[1033.82 → 1038.48] And then once a year we go, well, how was all that excitement for you?
[1038.64 → 1041.26] And hey, how was all that work for you?
[1041.72 → 1046.04] And why don't we balance them, you know?
[1046.38 → 1047.90] Make sure that everything makes sense.
[1047.90 → 1058.88] So, and also to be clear, Luke always made salary-wise more than legal minimum wage while he was at Linus Media Group.
[1059.30 → 1062.82] I take no responsibility for what NCI was paying.
[1062.94 → 1066.00] Yeah, that's actually a pretty good...
[1066.00 → 1067.74] Just to be clear.
[1068.12 → 1069.08] That's important.
[1069.08 → 1078.08] With that said, I think especially when the forum was having issues all the time, you were definitely working more hours than...
[1078.72 → 1082.20] But this was, and like, this is where understanding stuff comes into play too.
[1082.22 → 1083.02] Were you paying rent though?
[1083.84 → 1084.30] I was.
[1084.60 → 1084.88] Were you?
[1085.08 → 1086.90] I'm pretty sure it was a pretty sweet deal though.
[1086.94 → 1088.20] It was an amazing deal.
[1088.40 → 1089.20] Okay, okay.
[1089.32 → 1093.24] That was like, I mentally just mental math that into part of like the compensation process.
[1093.56 → 1095.00] But this is part of like the...
[1095.00 → 1095.88] And home-cooked meals.
[1096.20 → 1097.08] And which were like...
[1097.08 → 1100.76] I think that was like an extra 20 bucks a month or something like that.
[1100.76 → 1102.50] It was so nonsensical.
[1102.90 → 1103.38] It did...
[1103.38 → 1107.32] Whatever it was, I remember, it didn't pay for the ingredients for one meal.
[1107.74 → 1108.98] And it was like multiple.
[1109.30 → 1110.20] It was so good.
[1110.34 → 1111.68] He eats so much.
[1111.80 → 1112.04] Yeah.
[1112.30 → 1115.72] And we agreed to it when we hadn't really considered his size.
[1117.66 → 1119.68] And probably just as big as both of them.
[1119.68 → 1123.36] So my wife was off on maternity leave with my first son.
[1123.36 → 1123.64] Oh my goodness.
[1123.64 → 1125.14] My only son, excuse me.
[1125.42 → 1126.92] Well, the only one she knows about anyway.
[1127.08 → 1127.86] So she...
[1127.86 → 1128.48] Just kidding.
[1129.00 → 1131.90] So my wife was on maternity leave.
[1131.96 → 1134.84] So she was cooking all the meals for me and her and him.
[1135.26 → 1141.62] And so it wasn't really that much more work to throw some extra noodles and some extra beef and some extra veggies or whatever in the pasta.
[1142.66 → 1146.16] Except I would happily eat one to two meals a day and just go ham on that one.
[1146.16 → 1149.66] So I still actually kind of remember the negotiations here.
[1149.98 → 1153.24] Where Luke was like, well, like you're kind of doing it already anyway.
[1153.44 → 1156.26] So like really it should be kind of closer to materials cost.
[1156.38 → 1158.08] Yvonne estimates the materials cost.
[1158.34 → 1160.28] Gets it way under and Luke's like, okay.
[1163.24 → 1164.10] You sweet.
[1164.10 → 1169.62] You can always tell that you've offered this guy too much when he's like, okay.
[1172.46 → 1176.78] Because if you try to hold back, it's like, let me get back to you.
[1176.80 → 1178.88] And you get like this, you get like this document.
[1182.44 → 1183.04] Trust me.
[1183.04 → 1184.44] I've had it both ways with him.
[1184.62 → 1184.88] Yeah.
[1185.14 → 1185.42] Yeah.
[1185.50 → 1186.74] I mean, it's been a while.
[1186.80 → 1187.40] Oh man.
[1187.40 → 1190.88] We've been working together for nine years.
[1191.34 → 1192.16] Close to that.
[1192.18 → 1192.94] Eight or nine years.
[1193.18 → 1193.96] At least eight.
[1194.20 → 1194.70] At least eight.
[1194.70 → 1195.50] At least eight.
[1195.56 → 1195.72] Yeah.
[1195.72 → 1198.50] Because six and a quarter of Linus Media Group.
[1198.84 → 1199.12] Yeah.
[1199.42 → 1201.72] And then over a year of NCI.
[1202.66 → 1203.90] So, yeah.
[1204.42 → 1206.30] So we've had some exchanges.
[1207.30 → 1209.94] We have not agreed all the time.
[1210.42 → 1215.36] Even on this show, I think there's only been a handful of times that things have actually gotten kind of heated.
[1215.36 → 1219.70] But like, even on this show, I think we've kind of lost it a little bit with each other.
[1219.88 → 1222.18] So feel, rest assured.
[1222.48 → 1227.80] Us disagreeing on things was like the content of the WAN show for the first couple of years.
[1227.96 → 1229.02] It's actually true.
[1229.58 → 1230.98] It's gotten harder though.
[1231.06 → 1239.26] Because actually, you spend a decade in proximity or working towards the same goals with someone and having many of the same experiences.
[1239.74 → 1243.74] And it's actually kind of amazing the way that you start to mind meld.
[1243.74 → 1249.40] Like Luke and I will have more similar opinions pretty much across the board.
[1249.88 → 1252.78] Whether it is like, and I'm talking controversial topics.
[1252.92 → 1260.90] You know whether we're looking at religion or politics or capital punishment or like whatever it happens to be.
[1261.36 → 1264.98] You know, one of us will be going and doing some reading or whatever on our own time.
[1264.98 → 1269.92] And then we'll be like, hey, yeah, so I've been like thinking about this.
[1269.98 → 1276.32] I've been, you know, meditating on the merits of, you know, firing squads versus lethal injection or whatever.
[1276.44 → 1279.40] The kinds of conversations that you do not have in mixed company.
[1280.36 → 1284.32] And, you know, we'll just start to kind of like build on each other.
[1284.48 → 1286.94] And it's like, okay, yeah, we're on the same page.
[1286.94 → 1288.20] Yeah.
[1288.62 → 1289.48] Neat, I guess.
[1290.94 → 1292.60] This conversation has now been had.
[1292.62 → 1293.84] I guess we didn't need to bother.
[1295.04 → 1295.70] Wait a minute.
[1296.80 → 1299.24] Is tonight the thing?
[1299.42 → 1299.62] Yeah.
[1299.92 → 1300.82] I totally forgot.
[1300.94 → 1301.72] That's going to be fun.
[1302.78 → 1302.86] It's like not.
[1302.86 → 1303.96] Oh, how set up are you?
[1304.00 → 1305.10] The computer is set up.
[1305.20 → 1306.28] The monitors are on.
[1306.66 → 1307.70] The internet is working.
[1308.08 → 1308.78] Do you have like?
[1309.04 → 1310.28] I have controllers there.
[1310.46 → 1310.56] Okay.
[1310.66 → 1311.08] Okay.
[1311.18 → 1312.46] So we should announce it then.
[1312.68 → 1313.04] Sure.
[1313.12 → 1313.90] Like we're doing it, right?
[1314.20 → 1314.58] Yeah.
[1314.88 → 1317.56] I mean, we're going to get there, and then it might take a little.
[1317.92 → 1318.20] Just like.
[1318.28 → 1320.12] So it'll be a typical Linus and Luke.
[1320.40 → 1320.78] Yeah.
[1321.98 → 1322.88] After party.
[1323.16 → 1323.48] Yeah.
[1324.38 → 1326.50] The first after party in.
[1327.08 → 1327.38] Okay.
[1327.52 → 1328.26] So you see that?
[1328.70 → 1330.08] OBS just froze a little bit.
[1330.54 → 1331.40] Not a little bit.
[1331.48 → 1332.20] That's weird, right?
[1332.20 → 1332.50] Crazy.
[1332.72 → 1332.88] Yeah.
[1332.96 → 1333.54] Now it's back.
[1333.96 → 1334.10] Okay.
[1334.28 → 1334.72] Okay.
[1334.86 → 1335.48] I have a question.
[1335.58 → 1337.02] Was audio going during that?
[1337.12 → 1337.34] Yeah.
[1337.34 → 1338.44] And what did the stream do?
[1338.54 → 1338.72] Okay.
[1338.82 → 1339.52] Float plane chat.
[1339.60 → 1342.98] We need to hear from you guys about what exactly happened there.
[1342.98 → 1344.34] See, I still don't see the freeze.
[1345.02 → 1345.78] Well, is that it?
[1345.88 → 1346.38] That's it.
[1346.44 → 1349.34] And lots of people in Float plane are saying lag and dead.
[1349.34 → 1349.82] Interesting.
[1350.72 → 1352.34] So that was, that was OBS.
[1352.92 → 1353.40] 100%.
[1353.40 → 1354.82] I'm going to stop.
[1354.88 → 1355.76] Audio was going.
[1356.22 → 1359.46] So we have the stream playing on both YouTube and Twitch.
[1359.58 → 1363.64] So I'm going to lose that right now and just fire up task manager here.
[1363.68 → 1363.96] Interesting.
[1364.08 → 1366.98] So we've been trying to diagnose an issue with the streaming PC.
[1366.98 → 1370.50] Cause like the weird thing is the six core 12 thread processor.
[1370.66 → 1372.14] It should be more than enough.
[1372.56 → 1374.38] But every once in a while we get these spikes.
[1374.60 → 1378.18] You know what I kind of wonder is I actually wonder if it's a USB issue.
[1378.40 → 1382.86] If we should switch to all PCI Express capture cards and see if that's it.
[1382.86 → 1387.30] Because when you have more than one capture device over USB, it's a shared bus.
[1387.48 → 1391.48] And I think there's one of them, like one controller that we have two streams coming in on.
[1391.60 → 1392.86] You can run into issues.
[1392.86 → 1396.36] We've had that problem before a few times.
[1396.38 → 1397.84] Apparently the audio was fine.
[1398.24 → 1399.88] So that makes sense.
[1400.00 → 1402.16] It's probably the capture device.
[1402.32 → 1402.64] Interesting.
[1402.78 → 1404.26] We should also just see if there's a firmware update.
[1404.62 → 1405.50] Anyway, anyway.
[1405.70 → 1411.08] So tonight it's going to be the first after party in what has to be more than a year.
[1411.34 → 1411.90] A long time.
[1412.02 → 1413.66] We are going to be playing some Bro force.
[1413.92 → 1414.12] Yeah.
[1414.34 → 1421.86] And it is, to my understanding, anyway, going to be the first live stream from...
[1421.86 → 1422.48] My new place.
[1422.86 → 1423.62] Luke's new house?
[1423.76 → 1423.94] Yep.
[1424.20 → 1424.52] Woo!
[1425.06 → 1429.10] It was crazy how this worked out because you proposed this whole idea last week.
[1429.38 → 1429.76] Did I?
[1430.00 → 1430.34] I think.
[1430.64 → 1432.04] I don't remember exactly when it was.
[1432.38 → 1438.50] But I didn't realize, but yesterday was when my internet got turned off at the last place.
[1439.50 → 1441.50] So it was like actually not even an option.
[1442.02 → 1443.84] To stream from your old place.
[1443.84 → 1444.82] I had to move.
[1445.00 → 1445.38] Huh.
[1445.38 → 1446.82] I realized that like...
[1446.82 → 1448.24] So is all your stuff out now then?
[1448.72 → 1449.52] Not all my stuff.
[1450.24 → 1450.56] Okay.
[1450.64 → 1451.62] A very large percentage.
[1451.62 → 1452.54] You'll see, I guess.
[1452.90 → 1453.26] Okay.
[1453.46 → 1453.64] Cool.
[1453.76 → 1456.40] The vast majority of my books, my whole computer set up.
[1457.48 → 1458.38] There's no furniture.
[1458.38 → 1459.48] So basically everything important.
[1459.96 → 1460.22] Yeah.
[1461.14 → 1463.44] There's everything I like on my day to day.
[1463.90 → 1465.82] There's some kitchen stuff still left behind.
[1465.98 → 1468.38] There's some still like storage-y kind of things still left behind.
[1468.38 → 1470.34] The bookshelves are all still there.
[1470.46 → 1471.32] Moving sucks, hey?
[1471.40 → 1472.28] It really does.
[1472.40 → 1477.74] I love that you like have been moving over the last week and then rolled into the office
[1477.74 → 1479.86] on Monday and had to move out of your office.
[1480.12 → 1481.70] It was ridiculous.
[1481.70 → 1484.22] I've been moving every night.
[1484.34 → 1487.92] Even when I stream, I move at least a few boxes every night.
[1488.06 → 1489.46] Just because I'm trying to like...
[1489.46 → 1494.14] If I do have to do one big day when I like call in the troops, I'm trying to make it the
[1494.14 → 1495.90] the smallest big day I possibly can.
[1495.96 → 1496.08] Right.
[1496.24 → 1497.54] And it's getting pretty small.
[1497.54 → 1500.72] More chips and beer, less actual carrying heavy things.
[1500.82 → 1500.98] Yeah.
[1501.12 → 1505.82] More realistically, it would be like one or two trips than mostly hanging out because that's
[1505.82 → 1506.76] the point it's getting to.
[1506.88 → 1511.64] And I had a lot of help last night actually from the roommate that's moving in and some
[1511.64 → 1512.48] mutual friends.
[1512.54 → 1512.70] Cool.
[1512.86 → 1513.60] Which was awesome.
[1514.66 → 1517.26] But yeah, it's getting pretty set up.
[1517.72 → 1521.50] The networking situation is interesting.
[1522.00 → 1522.48] Oh, really?
[1522.50 → 1523.62] Which I guess you'll see as well.
[1523.82 → 1524.22] Okay.
[1524.64 → 1526.42] I've never had networking through the walls before.
[1526.88 → 1527.14] Yeah?
[1527.14 → 1528.58] And I have my...
[1528.58 → 1529.44] I made a video on it.
[1529.54 → 1530.12] You guys can check it out.
[1530.14 → 1530.74] It's actually pretty cool.
[1530.78 → 1533.22] I have my big wooden panel networking board.
[1533.50 → 1533.74] Yeah.
[1533.96 → 1534.60] So I...
[1534.60 → 1535.84] You still have that?
[1536.06 → 1536.34] Yeah.
[1536.94 → 1540.10] I thought that was just like a thing you made for the video, and then you were going to
[1540.10 → 1540.64] throw it away.
[1540.80 → 1541.66] That was all my hardware.
[1542.36 → 1542.72] Oh.
[1542.94 → 1544.38] I bolted my hardware on there.
[1545.20 → 1545.52] Okay.
[1547.12 → 1548.26] It's kind of nuts.
[1548.70 → 1551.32] That was like I wanted to do it anyway.
[1552.24 → 1552.58] I don't know.
[1552.58 → 1554.44] This has been a long time ago, so I don't expect you to remember the story.
[1554.44 → 1556.12] But I wanted to do it anyway.
[1556.12 → 1557.68] Then I was like, hey, should I make a video to this?
[1557.72 → 1559.20] And you were like, yeah, sure.
[1559.94 → 1561.88] So I used some like...
[1561.88 → 1562.36] Yeah, that.
[1562.90 → 1563.30] Yeah, yeah.
[1563.92 → 1565.56] DIY ghetto networking wall.
[1565.96 → 1567.00] A renter's solution.
[1567.00 → 1572.44] Now it has to be converted into a person who owns a place solution.
[1573.38 → 1575.54] So yeah, I put all that hardware on a board.
[1576.64 → 1581.22] And then got like crapped on because hashtag Jay's two cents did it first.
[1581.38 → 1582.72] Yeah, that sucked.
[1582.98 → 1585.18] Jay was cool about it, but the community was like, what?
[1585.70 → 1589.48] So yeah, that exact board looks exactly like that.
[1589.72 → 1591.98] Plus a few Ethernet cables that I've now removed.
[1591.98 → 1595.68] So it looks like that again, minus the fibre box because that's not mine.
[1595.86 → 1596.20] Right.
[1596.32 → 1599.04] So I took the fibre box off, and I brought it to the new place.
[1599.58 → 1600.90] This switch is gigantic.
[1601.48 → 1601.78] Yeah.
[1601.92 → 1602.06] Yeah.
[1602.08 → 1603.80] That's like a 48 port switch, isn't it?
[1603.88 → 1604.10] Yeah.
[1604.16 → 1604.78] It's huge.
[1604.78 → 1606.44] Why did you get a 48 port switch?
[1606.50 → 1606.68] Right.
[1606.74 → 1608.42] Because you used to run lands and stuff.
[1608.56 → 1608.76] Yeah.
[1609.16 → 1609.32] Yeah.
[1609.32 → 1609.66] Right.
[1609.66 → 1612.72] I actually used it to fairly high capacity a number of times.
[1612.98 → 1613.20] All right.
[1613.20 → 1615.24] And I got a perfect deal.
[1615.30 → 1615.84] I believe you.
[1616.00 → 1616.18] Yeah.
[1616.36 → 1616.54] Yeah.
[1617.66 → 1620.36] If you bought it, you got a good deal on it.
[1621.08 → 1623.32] Because that's the kind of bloke you are.
[1623.48 → 1625.30] I got a perfect deal on the place too.
[1625.58 → 1626.56] And it came with furniture.
[1626.88 → 1627.80] Really, you're going to see.
[1627.86 → 1629.12] It's like a nice couch and stuff.
[1629.30 → 1629.52] Nice.
[1629.52 → 1635.52] The place has one of those networking cubby things.
[1636.58 → 1638.30] It's like a white door.
[1638.78 → 1639.58] You open the door.
[1639.98 → 1642.40] There's like all your networking into the house goes in there.
[1642.76 → 1645.44] And then the network installers put their boxes in there and stuff.
[1645.52 → 1645.78] Got it.
[1645.82 → 1645.86] Okay.
[1645.86 → 1646.88] And there's a little bit of space.
[1647.26 → 1647.52] Okay.
[1648.30 → 1648.62] Oh.
[1648.94 → 1650.20] A little bit of space, you say.
[1650.34 → 1650.68] Yeah.
[1651.34 → 1651.74] Yeah.
[1651.82 → 1653.16] Not enough space at all.
[1653.16 → 1655.20] So I really don't know what I'm going to do.
[1657.16 → 1658.36] But, yeah.
[1658.36 → 1660.72] There's like a few Ethernet ports plugged in.
[1660.86 → 1661.38] That's another thing.
[1661.46 → 1663.14] There's eight Ethernet ports in the house.
[1663.88 → 1664.12] Wow.
[1664.14 → 1664.78] That's pretty good.
[1665.12 → 1665.94] That is pretty good.
[1666.02 → 1666.28] That's nice.
[1666.28 → 1667.24] There's actually quite a few.
[1667.48 → 1667.70] Cool.
[1667.94 → 1668.10] Okay.
[1668.12 → 1669.66] The box they gave me does not have eight ports.
[1669.90 → 1672.22] My switch is giant and doesn't fit in there.
[1672.60 → 1672.92] Right.
[1673.46 → 1677.94] So you just, I mean, you just need like an eight or a 12 port switch or something like that.
[1678.02 → 1682.40] But even then, I'm like already running out of space in there and I need the AP in there and stuff.
[1682.40 → 1683.70] So I think I'm going to have to.
[1683.84 → 1683.94] No.
[1684.04 → 1685.52] You should put your AP somewhere else.
[1686.16 → 1687.58] And your AP is kind of like.
[1687.58 → 1690.22] That room is actually very centralized in the house.
[1691.54 → 1691.86] Hmm.
[1692.52 → 1692.74] All right.
[1692.74 → 1693.36] Well, I'm going to come.
[1693.46 → 1694.16] I'll come see it tonight.
[1694.26 → 1695.02] I'll come see it tonight.
[1695.12 → 1695.22] Yeah.
[1696.18 → 1696.70] All right.
[1696.88 → 1699.94] Oh, you know what we should actually do is sponsor.
[1700.82 → 1701.48] Heck yes.
[1701.48 → 1706.88] For some reason, people still sponsor the WAN show, including Back blaze.
[1706.94 → 1707.14] Hey.
[1708.14 → 1713.24] Back blaze is an unlimited cloud backup for Mac and PC for $6 a month.
[1713.44 → 1722.88] They have over 35 billion files restored that you can back up docs, music, photos, videos, drawings, projects, just all the data.
[1722.88 → 1729.42] You can restore files anywhere, including directly downloading them on the web or even restoring them by mail.
[1729.56 → 1732.60] If you're into that sort of thing, because your internet connection is not that fast.
[1732.76 → 1734.68] You can purchase a restore via hard drive.
[1734.76 → 1737.16] They will actually overnight that thing to you via FedEx.
[1737.42 → 1738.56] They've got mobile apps.
[1738.56 → 1741.02] So you can access your files on the go.
[1741.76 → 1743.52] And after you were, oh, this is cool.
[1743.78 → 1744.86] Most places don't do this.
[1744.96 → 1748.42] After you restore your data, you can actually return that hard drive to them for a refund.
[1748.86 → 1752.56] Like most data recovery places that I'm aware of, you just, no, you bought that hard drive now.
[1752.66 → 1753.04] That's yours.
[1753.28 → 1753.34] Yeah.
[1753.46 → 1753.96] That's cool.
[1754.06 → 1755.96] No wonky cost structures or anything like this.
[1756.02 → 1758.26] Just unlimited data backup at a fixed price.
[1758.40 → 1763.86] So get a fully featured 15-day free trial at backblaze.com slash LTT.
[1763.86 → 1769.36] Go there, play around with it, and start protecting yourself from potential bad times.
[1769.64 → 1771.26] And I'm talking very bad times.
[1771.36 → 1775.86] Data loss is even less fun than like...
[1779.22 → 1779.90] You know what?
[1779.96 → 1781.06] I'm not even gonna...
[1781.06 → 1781.74] It just sucks.
[1781.88 → 1782.46] Yeah, it's bad.
[1782.66 → 1782.88] It's bad.
[1782.92 → 1786.80] The things that would be, you know, you just don't want to talk about them.
[1787.00 → 1787.16] Yeah.
[1787.36 → 1787.74] Pulse way.
[1788.36 → 1789.48] That's what we want to talk about.
[1789.58 → 1789.80] Yeah.
[1789.80 → 1793.50] We actually have a really cool project coming up for Pulse way very soon.
[1794.12 → 1796.36] We're going to be shooting like a...
[1796.36 → 1798.68] Like actually like a commercial spot for them.
[1798.92 → 1799.16] Oh.
[1799.62 → 1800.76] And it's got...
[1800.76 → 1801.02] Oh, wait.
[1801.10 → 1802.58] I don't know if I'm supposed to talk about this.
[1802.72 → 1802.92] Okay.
[1803.12 → 1807.56] Pulse way is a real-time remote monitoring and management software that allows you to, well,
[1807.66 → 1809.42] manage and monitor from one app.
[1809.50 → 1813.70] It's compatible with Windows, Mac, Linux, and applications, and gives you access to real-time
[1813.70 → 1818.76] status, system resources, logged-in users, network performance, Windows updates, and more.
[1818.76 → 1823.58] You can fix problems on the go by sending commands from any mobile device, and you can create
[1823.58 → 1826.40] and deploy custom scripts to automate your IT tasks.
[1826.74 → 1829.84] Honestly, one of my favourite things about it, aside from remote desktop functionality,
[1830.34 → 1835.02] is the fact that you can just set it up to give you notifications for just basic stuff.
[1835.22 → 1840.12] Like whenever our main storage server goes under 15%, I get a ping, and I can be like,
[1840.22 → 1840.40] hey!
[1841.12 → 1841.28] What?
[1842.02 → 1843.02] Move stuff to the vault!
[1843.66 → 1844.28] It's great.
[1844.66 → 1844.94] It's wonderful.
[1844.94 → 1846.02] Okay, pause.
[1846.54 → 1847.14] Wait, are you done?
[1847.48 → 1851.34] So try it for free today at Pulseway.com or through our link in the video description.
[1851.60 → 1852.04] Okay, pause.
[1853.28 → 1854.98] Go back to the previous one.
[1856.52 → 1857.24] Back blaze.
[1857.24 → 1857.44] Back blaze.
[1858.04 → 1859.38] Go back to the thing.
[1859.58 → 1859.92] The banner.
[1860.06 → 1861.56] Oh, oh, oh, we're talking about Back blaze again.
[1861.80 → 1864.14] It shows on here, slash, when.
[1864.36 → 1865.06] Oh, oh!
[1865.06 → 1867.26] What we said was slash LTT.
[1867.42 → 1868.52] Thank you very much, Flow plane Chat.
[1868.76 → 1869.36] Oh, whoops.
[1869.76 → 1870.64] I don't know which one.
[1870.70 → 1871.08] Try both.
[1871.50 → 1871.74] Yeah.
[1872.56 → 1873.22] There you go.
[1873.36 → 1874.70] I just want to make sure everyone knew that.
[1874.94 → 1876.32] Also, FreshBooks.

[1908.60 → 1909.20] first time.
[1909.28 → 1912.10] So you don't have that, you know, oh, sorry, I didn't pay it on time.
[1912.14 → 1912.86] Well, I didn't get it.

[1931.60 → 1933.76] sign up for your free trial.
[1935.50 → 1939.44] I actually, now I have to shill for our own stuff.
[1939.90 → 1940.50] I'm sorry.
[1940.66 → 1941.72] Do you feel bad about this though?
[1941.84 → 1942.62] No, not at all.
[1942.68 → 1944.20] LTX is going to be freaking awesome.
[1944.42 → 1944.48] Yeah.
[1944.48 → 1947.14] Okay, so I've got a new update for you guys.
[1947.24 → 1950.58] All my friends are like scrambling to go, and I didn't even push them.
[1950.72 → 1950.94] Really?
[1951.04 → 1951.84] It's kind of cool.
[1951.92 → 1952.48] That's awesome.
[1952.56 → 1953.30] I'm pretty stoked.
[1953.62 → 1954.18] Escape VR.
[1954.42 → 1958.56] So for those of you who came out to previous LTX events, you probably already know how busy
[1958.56 → 1959.96] our VR space was.
[1960.30 → 1961.02] Very busy.
[1961.26 → 1962.02] It was bad.
[1962.16 → 1962.58] Long lines.
[1962.66 → 1963.28] Very bad.
[1963.56 → 1968.04] So last year, we did not account for how many people would be in line to check it out.
[1968.04 → 1970.54] And some people ended up basically standing in line the whole time.
[1970.54 → 1975.30] So this year, we've made it a big priority to have a bigger and better VR experience,
[1975.46 → 1978.76] including some partners to help manage these systems.
[1979.20 → 1984.82] So that's why we're really excited to have Escape VR join us at LTX 2019 featuring Dream Hack.
[1984.96 → 1990.02] They're coming all the way up from California and bringing their escape room styled VR games
[1990.02 → 1990.56] with them.
[1990.70 → 1994.18] So we're still working on the final details, but we can confirm they're going to be in
[1994.18 → 1997.46] a gigantic 30-foot by 40 foot space.
[1997.90 → 2001.04] So that's 10 meters by 13 meter for the Europeans out there.
[2001.46 → 2004.38] And with different multiplayer experiences.
[2004.78 → 2005.20] That's awesome.
[2005.42 → 2007.86] So there's the possibility for one large game.
[2008.06 → 2010.26] Remember, you're in a group, so you actually work together.
[2010.36 → 2010.52] Yeah.
[2010.62 → 2013.38] Or two smaller grouped games within the space.
[2013.72 → 2017.02] And all the games will be able to have roughly two to six people at a time.
[2017.02 → 2020.08] So make sure that you guys are hanging out on the LTT forum.
[2020.18 → 2027.42] I have seen a ton of like grouping up threads where people are like linking up before the
[2027.42 → 2027.62] show.
[2027.72 → 2031.62] So they know each other are coming and they, you know, they already chat or hang out on
[2031.62 → 2032.72] the forum or whatever else.
[2032.72 → 2036.96] And from extensive experience of doing cons, that can be really cool.
[2037.28 → 2039.92] Having a buddy at a con is like actually really sweet.
[2040.04 → 2041.88] We've even seen people like carpool.
[2042.32 → 2043.66] Like, hey, I'm here.
[2043.74 → 2045.48] Is anyone coming along this way?
[2045.48 → 2047.68] Like, no, I've seen a ton of them.
[2047.78 → 2048.38] That's pretty cool.
[2048.46 → 2048.58] Yeah.
[2048.62 → 2049.44] So it's pretty sick.
[2049.56 → 2053.14] So having, having some people that you want to hang with while you're at the show would
[2053.14 → 2054.04] be definitely good.
[2054.10 → 2054.82] Highly recommended.
[2055.00 → 2061.52] I'm not actually coming out and recommending, um, like effectively internet hitchhiking, but
[2061.52 → 2063.78] like, I'm just saying people are doing it.
[2063.78 → 2066.22] It's not technically hitchhiking, but I understand where you're going.
[2066.26 → 2068.98] I'm just clarifying because that's illegal and there's different.
[2069.20 → 2071.86] It's like a it's an internet thumb out kind of thing.
[2071.86 → 2072.10] Yeah.
[2072.10 → 2072.96] But it is, you're right.
[2073.00 → 2074.52] It is not actually hitchhiking.
[2074.68 → 2074.74] Yeah.
[2074.74 → 2078.96] Um, one thing is Jay and I did a fairly similar.
[2079.36 → 2080.54] It's definitely not the same.
[2080.92 → 2084.94] There's definitely clearly different things about it, but Jay and I did a fairly similar,
[2084.94 → 2088.66] like get through the experience VR thing in Vegas.
[2088.66 → 2090.08] And it was very fun.
[2090.08 → 2093.76] It's really cool to be in the same area with someone else who's in VR.
[2094.32 → 2099.34] And the issue with that I've always had with escape rooms is that the puzzles are designed
[2099.34 → 2106.06] to be easily reset, to not be damaged by the idiots who go through there, you know, a hundred
[2106.06 → 2106.66] times a day.
[2106.86 → 2106.90] Yeah.
[2106.90 → 2106.98] Yeah.
[2106.98 → 2115.72] And so pretty much you end up with some variation of unlock this padlock using clues that are
[2115.72 → 2116.34] written somewhere.
[2116.34 → 2116.78] Super obscure.
[2116.78 → 2117.46] And it's, yeah.
[2117.58 → 2117.78] Yeah.
[2118.16 → 2121.28] My biggest thing is that they're aggressively designed to make you fail.
[2121.28 → 2121.88] Yes.
[2122.26 → 2125.90] And it's, it's, it's frustrating because you end up with adventure game logic.
[2126.36 → 2126.76] Yeah.
[2126.76 → 2134.16] Where it's like, Oh, I just had to move my head in the shape of a clock.
[2134.16 → 2138.42] And then I would, if I adjusted the angle just right, then these things would line up
[2138.42 → 2141.82] and I'd read the numbers, and it's always just numbers and a padlock.
[2142.02 → 2143.70] It's just, it's annoying.
[2143.96 → 2144.40] It's kind of lame.
[2144.58 → 2148.16] Whereas with VR, the possibilities are endless.
[2148.16 → 2148.48] Are endless.
[2148.86 → 2149.02] Oh.
[2149.02 → 2156.74] Speaking of endless possibilities that the LTT store finally has enough shipping volume
[2156.74 → 2159.24] that we managed to negotiate a deal with Canada post.
[2159.38 → 2163.26] And we have users in Europe reporting shipping rates as low as seven to $9.
[2164.32 → 2165.44] That's super cool.
[2165.58 → 2170.04] I've had people complaining about that for so long, but like, we've all had people complaining
[2170.04 → 2170.62] about that.
[2170.70 → 2171.34] Thank you, Luke.
[2171.34 → 2171.62] Yeah.
[2171.82 → 2172.26] Yes.
[2172.32 → 2172.80] We're aware.
[2173.00 → 2177.00] So we are aware we've been working on it.
[2177.00 → 2181.84] The thing is the efforts that the LMG guys have been going through to make this stuff
[2181.84 → 2183.52] awesome have been pretty intense.
[2183.76 → 2187.20] And like the quality of the shirts and the quality of the stuff that they're getting out.
[2187.66 → 2191.52] They're genuinely very nice shirts now, which is really cool.
[2191.52 → 2191.60] Hey, look at that guy.
[2192.42 → 2193.60] Like, yeah, there you go.
[2194.40 → 2195.16] The same one.
[2195.58 → 2199.40] My actual favourite shirt right now is the Constellation shirt from the LTT store.
[2199.40 → 2200.48] Might be out of stock of that one.
[2200.56 → 2201.08] No, never mind.
[2201.72 → 2204.08] I'm just going to see if we have all the sizes.
[2204.82 → 2205.66] Looks like it?
[2205.66 → 2207.52] No, we don't have any triple extra large.
[2207.72 → 2209.40] It's just a really nice shirt.
[2209.54 → 2210.72] It's a really nice quality shirt.
[2210.82 → 2211.60] The print's really nice.
[2211.72 → 2214.90] Like, it's the quality of level has skyrocketed.
[2215.04 → 2217.66] And to do that, it seems we've had to do a lot more stuff ourselves.
[2217.66 → 2219.12] There's been a lot of growing pains.
[2219.28 → 2220.62] Including crazy shipping rates.
[2220.88 → 2224.30] As we've learned and mostly learned.
[2224.50 → 2226.38] But they're getting taken care of, which is really cool.
[2226.94 → 2230.40] Speaking of things getting taken care of, we should really take care of the topic that
[2230.40 → 2232.30] was the subject of today's WAN show.
[2232.30 → 2233.74] I said that was my New Year's resolution.
[2233.94 → 2235.06] I got totally derailed.
[2235.26 → 2236.10] Immediately broke it.
[2236.18 → 2237.22] Immediately broke it.
[2237.50 → 2237.74] Okay.
[2238.00 → 2241.56] So, the GTX 1660 has launched.
[2241.94 → 2247.30] We don't have a review up yet because, I don't know.
[2247.38 → 2248.74] We just weren't in that big of a hurry.
[2248.78 → 2249.18] No, actually.
[2249.26 → 2249.94] That's not what happened.
[2249.94 → 2252.98] So, Nvidia didn't seed these to partners.
[2253.44 → 2258.60] And actually, most of the partners that we typically work with, like Asus, for example,
[2259.16 → 2266.14] just straight up did not have cards early enough to seed them to us for a launch day review.
[2266.80 → 2270.56] So, VGA came to the rescue and managed to get us one.
[2270.62 → 2274.14] But it was only a couple of days before the review embargo lifted.
[2274.14 → 2280.44] And the cold hard truth is that when you are trying to do video rather than a written article,
[2280.68 → 2282.56] it just takes more time.
[2283.10 → 2288.12] So, I think the video is going up on, like, Saturday or Sunday or something like that.
[2288.34 → 2291.20] In a nutshell, though, it's all right, I guess.
[2292.00 → 2296.46] Unless you're after performance per dollar, in which case you should probably get an RX 580.
[2296.46 → 2300.52] What else do we have?
[2301.50 → 2302.98] Windows updates suck less now.
[2303.08 → 2305.94] So, the original article here is from arstechnica.com.
[2306.38 → 2312.16] Windows 10 updates will apparently now check for compatibility issues when they are installed.
[2312.70 → 2316.46] But they will roll back if there's a problem.
[2316.74 → 2318.00] So, here's what I want to know.
[2319.50 → 2324.68] If they detect a compatibility issue, why do they install in the first place?
[2325.40 → 2326.42] We were talking earlier.
[2326.56 → 2328.74] About how we, like, see eye to eye on a lot more things lately?
[2329.06 → 2329.66] What the heck?
[2330.06 → 2334.82] And, like, okay, I'm just waiting for the headline of, like, someone's computer is now just looping
[2334.82 → 2339.96] in this endless process of update, rollback, update, rollback, update, rollback, because something happened.
[2339.96 → 2341.20] Oh, matter of time.
[2341.24 → 2342.76] Just, it's going to be a nightmare.
[2343.24 → 2344.68] Absolutely a matter of time.
[2344.78 → 2346.20] Check first.
[2346.36 → 2353.46] Windows 10 Home users can also now defer updates for 35 days, same as Windows 10 Pro and Enterprise.
[2353.84 → 2356.28] Should be able to do that forever if you want.
[2356.46 → 2357.82] Well, okay.
[2358.04 → 2358.88] Hold on a second.
[2359.10 → 2361.82] If you, like, really go into it, there should be a way.
[2362.08 → 2362.50] Forever?
[2363.02 → 2364.08] There should be a way.
[2364.72 → 2373.20] So, by that logic, should you be allowed to defer your measles vaccine forever?
[2373.24 → 2373.66] No.
[2374.42 → 2374.92] Because...
[2374.92 → 2375.14] Why?
[2375.40 → 2376.80] Because your computer...
[2376.80 → 2377.22] Hold on.
[2377.26 → 2377.30] Hold on.
[2377.30 → 2380.98] Your computer isn't going to make everyone else at school get sick and die.
[2381.18 → 2383.42] Is it because it puts other people at risk?
[2385.16 → 2385.72] Okay.
[2385.72 → 2389.70] So, do your rights end where someone else's begin?
[2390.22 → 2390.86] Does that...
[2390.86 → 2391.34] Is that...
[2391.34 → 2392.98] Is that equivalent here?
[2393.26 → 2393.94] Could be.
[2394.34 → 2396.08] If you had, like...
[2396.08 → 2396.78] Because of botnet?
[2397.62 → 2399.18] That's exactly where I was going with that.
[2399.18 → 2404.94] If you have an army of non-updated computers, you could actually be putting...
[2404.94 → 2406.00] Now, hold on a minute.
[2406.62 → 2409.76] You could be putting the entire internet at risk.
[2410.14 → 2412.44] You remember when Cloudflare got hit a couple of years ago?
[2412.56 → 2414.32] It took down, like, a quarter of the freaking internet.
[2414.32 → 2415.88] I hate that I'm starting to agree with you!
[2415.94 → 2416.44] And...
[2416.44 → 2417.26] Damn it.
[2417.54 → 2425.26] When the internet goes down, it's more than just like, oh no, I can't read my AOL mail anymore.
[2425.64 → 2432.36] Like, there are critical, critical services that run over the internet now that could mean
[2432.36 → 2435.28] the difference between life and death for someone.
[2437.76 → 2439.88] I love the pen slam.
[2440.30 → 2440.60] It's...
[2440.60 → 2441.58] Yeah, no, it's...
[2441.58 → 2442.38] Well, there's nowhere else to put it on the screen.
[2442.38 → 2442.54] Yeah.
[2443.54 → 2443.94] Yeah.
[2443.94 → 2444.58] This laptop.
[2444.68 → 2446.20] This laptop has nowhere to put the pen.
[2446.46 → 2449.24] I begrudgingly agree with you.
[2449.36 → 2449.84] There's...
[2449.84 → 2450.74] It's been interesting.
[2450.90 → 2453.28] Have you heard about the stuff where fire departments have started...
[2453.28 → 2454.60] They've started using their own cell phones?
[2455.04 → 2458.82] Because the fire department has, like, a data cap.
[2459.66 → 2460.98] And there will be a disaster.
[2461.76 → 2463.32] And they'll use all their data.
[2463.68 → 2465.24] And then their internet will get shut off.
[2466.00 → 2467.52] So they've had to start using their cell phones.
[2467.60 → 2470.04] Then the firefighters individually go into crazy overages.
[2472.12 → 2473.16] It's like...
[2473.16 → 2474.32] It's happened a few times.
[2474.38 → 2475.28] It's terrible.
[2475.50 → 2475.78] Okay.
[2476.64 → 2477.20] Firefighters...
[2477.20 → 2478.32] That's an unrelated thing.
[2478.32 → 2481.38] Now, I'm sure there are some evil firefighters that exist out there.
[2481.58 → 2484.60] But by and large, if we're going to generalize, firefighters are heroes.
[2485.10 → 2487.68] So, like, we actually need to not...
[2487.68 → 2491.64] We need to not charge firefighters for saving lives.
[2491.68 → 2498.00] The point you brought up about, like, super important infrastructure things running on networks is very true.
[2498.48 → 2499.96] Firefighter, police, hospital.
[2500.02 → 2502.78] If you want to come back to, like, the basic services...
[2502.78 → 2503.02] Right.
[2503.02 → 2504.94] They all run very heavily on internet.
[2505.14 → 2507.48] So now, let's have another conversation.
[2508.32 → 2514.78] Should Google be required to provide security updates for their Android operating system for far longer than they do now?
[2515.74 → 2522.72] Because most of the large bot-based attacks that are occurring these days are not actually desktop computers.
[2522.72 → 2524.62] It's actually mobile and IoT devices.
[2524.62 → 2527.84] So, where does the liability lie for this?
[2527.92 → 2530.20] Oh, we're going down the rabbit hole now, baby.
[2530.48 → 2530.64] Yeah.
[2531.56 → 2538.04] At what point in time can you say that device is EOL and remote brick it?
[2538.92 → 2541.06] That's exactly where I was going next.
[2541.60 → 2542.32] Mind melding.
[2544.32 → 2547.76] And I totally understand both perspectives here.
[2547.90 → 2550.00] On the one hand, this is my device.
[2550.12 → 2551.02] I paid for it.
[2551.12 → 2551.72] I own it.
[2551.80 → 2553.28] It's mine to do with as I please.
[2553.28 → 2562.44] On the other hand, for the sake of the greater good, actually, you really shouldn't be using that anymore because you are a risk to yourself and others.
[2562.58 → 2565.60] Maybe what they would have to do is just not allow you to connect to the net.
[2565.70 → 2567.68] But then it becomes a whole deeper conversation.
[2568.30 → 2569.90] Freedom versus nanny state.
[2570.52 → 2572.28] And then, no, no, we're...
[2573.44 → 2577.40] Frankly, no one's really wrong in that case.
[2577.64 → 2582.02] They're just right from different perspectives for different individuals.
[2582.02 → 2582.72] That's interesting.
[2583.28 → 2584.40] We should straw poll this.
[2585.30 → 2585.96] Oh, boy.
[2586.14 → 2587.66] That's going to be a really intense...
[2587.66 → 2588.88] What exactly would we straw poll?
[2588.88 → 2589.66] I don't even know.
[2590.44 → 2590.88] I...
[2590.88 → 2591.44] I...
[2591.44 → 2591.94] Uh...
[2591.94 → 2593.40] Let's do it based on the phone.
[2594.24 → 2598.72] Should a manufacturer be allowed to brick an insecure phone?
[2598.92 → 2599.70] Is that the question?
[2600.36 → 2601.02] Yeah, okay.
[2601.02 → 2607.08] But I think we're going to have to add in when the date after you receive...
[2607.08 → 2608.46] Is it receiving the phone or when...
[2608.46 → 2609.76] It would have to be when the phone's launched.
[2609.86 → 2610.34] You know what?
[2610.52 → 2611.56] Let's do it this way.
[2611.92 → 2614.96] How long should a manufacturer have to wait?
[2614.96 → 2616.86] And then one of them is indefinite?
[2616.90 → 2617.10] Yeah.
[2617.36 → 2617.68] Okay.
[2617.88 → 2618.16] Okay.
[2618.24 → 2618.78] I like it.
[2621.68 → 2622.74] You're going to have to vote.
[2623.10 → 2623.86] Yeah, I know.
[2625.42 → 2626.40] That's why I'm like...
[2626.40 → 2627.64] That's why I just did the...
[2627.64 → 2628.86] Because I'm thinking about it.
[2629.64 → 2631.48] Straw poll dot me.
[2631.74 → 2632.68] Do they have dot com yet?
[2632.76 → 2633.86] Did they ever get that?
[2634.20 → 2634.64] I don't know.
[2634.76 → 2635.10] Doesn't matter.
[2635.62 → 2635.92] Okay.
[2636.30 → 2636.64] Okay.
[2636.74 → 2638.46] So I'm going to go with...
[2638.46 → 2640.92] I'm going to put in one year, but I think that's ridiculous.
[2640.92 → 2641.56] That's ridiculous.
[2641.82 → 2647.62] I'm going to put in three because I think that's a pretty typical security update timeline for Android devices.
[2647.78 → 2653.82] I'm going to put five because Apple has actually been pretty consistent about supporting their devices for four to five, sometimes even more.
[2653.82 → 2654.30] Okay.
[2654.38 → 2659.80] Another thing is, is it brick or is it brick the connecting to the internet component?
[2659.80 → 2669.60] Let's say to remove an insecure phone's networking capabilities.
[2669.64 → 2669.90] Okay.
[2670.02 → 2670.28] Yeah.
[2670.54 → 2672.76] Because if you want to use it as like your...
[2672.76 → 2673.90] An iPod, basically.
[2674.00 → 2674.40] As an iPod.
[2674.40 → 2674.92] Or whatever.
[2675.12 → 2677.84] There are actually a lot of functions phones can do without connecting.
[2677.84 → 2682.56] It's actually really annoying the way Apple constantly harasses you to put a SIM in the iPhone.
[2683.00 → 2683.92] I have one.
[2684.00 → 2687.10] I have an iPhone 6 that I just use as like an MP3 player.
[2687.26 → 2687.44] Yeah.
[2687.44 → 2689.96] And it's like constant.
[2690.12 → 2690.52] No.
[2690.72 → 2691.40] No, I do not.
[2691.40 → 2691.58] No.
[2691.66 → 2692.82] I know there's no SIM in it.
[2694.02 → 2695.86] I don't care.
[2696.80 → 2698.56] You cannot tell it to not do that anyway.
[2700.26 → 2701.24] Someone in chat said,
[2701.24 → 2706.82] I'm not necessarily sure what country they're talking about, but I think this is quite common in a lot of countries.
[2707.22 → 2708.72] Law states that a manufacturer,
[2709.00 → 2715.66] manufacturer should support a product at least two years after the consumer has bought it, not after the launch date.
[2715.66 → 2716.30] Hmm.
[2716.30 → 2718.12] So maybe consider that.
[2718.46 → 2720.02] We need an indefinitely as well.
[2720.26 → 2720.78] Um.
[2721.42 → 2723.62] I don't know where you necessarily want to put that, but.
[2724.24 → 2725.24] I'm going to put it here.
[2725.72 → 2727.80] I think I've covered enough here.
[2728.52 → 2730.02] Uh, okay.
[2730.24 → 2732.00] And we're specifically talking about phones.
[2732.60 → 2732.80] Yeah.
[2732.86 → 2733.78] That's another thing to consider.
[2733.78 → 2738.24] Yeah, we're narrowing the scope of our question just to, um.
[2738.24 → 2741.14] Phones and cutting off ability to access the internet.
[2741.26 → 2744.18] So you know what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to pull float plane first.
[2744.18 → 2749.16] So this way we can actually see how our different audiences feel about this.
[2749.24 → 2750.76] I'm just kind of curious right now.
[2751.44 → 2755.74] So I'm, I'm going to vote, but I'm not going to reveal my vote.
[2757.26 → 2758.22] Oh, shoot.
[2758.26 → 2759.16] I have to do the recapture.
[2759.92 → 2761.38] Such an interesting.
[2762.50 → 2763.58] I'll try to grab.
[2764.32 → 2764.76] Okay.
[2764.76 → 2768.46] So we're going to, we've got the results coming in from float plane.
[2769.26 → 2772.12] Float plane is a freaking dialled in audience.
[2772.38 → 2777.62] Cause like there's a lot of people watching over there, but like not that many, but we've
[2777.62 → 2779.20] already got 130 votes.
[2779.70 → 2780.34] Oh wow.
[2780.38 → 2781.52] It did not like that apostrophe.
[2782.12 → 2782.76] All right.
[2782.78 → 2783.54] So here it is.
[2784.12 → 2790.26] We've got 48%, 49% of the votes coming in for five years.
[2790.88 → 2793.58] We've got 17% saying indefinite.
[2793.58 → 2802.14] We've got 23% saying 10 years and 10% of you think it should be okay for a manufacturer
[2802.14 → 2807.24] to brick the phone within, oh no, less than 10% of you within three years.
[2807.34 → 2810.46] So, so three years or one year, almost no one.
[2810.52 → 2811.16] It's 10 now.
[2811.30 → 2815.22] Thinks 15 years, because I think people either go, you know what?
[2815.28 → 2816.62] 10 years is a nice round number.
[2816.68 → 2818.18] That's a very reasonable amount of time.
[2818.22 → 2822.04] If I had to buy six phones in my adult lifetime, that seems reasonable.
[2822.04 → 2826.12] And then anyone who thinks you should wait longer than that, it looks like is straight
[2826.12 → 2826.90] up indefinite.
[2827.14 → 2827.42] Yeah.
[2827.52 → 2833.92] About half of people apparently would be okay with manufacturers breaking a phone after
[2833.92 → 2834.18] five years.
[2834.18 → 2839.80] I find it amazing that indefinite isn't just like wrecking the top.
[2839.98 → 2840.52] Me too.
[2840.94 → 2841.42] Me too.
[2841.54 → 2842.04] But it's...
[2842.04 → 2845.72] I thought we were going to get skewered for you and I both kind of leaning towards the
[2845.72 → 2846.92] like, yeah, maybe that should be able to happen.
[2846.92 → 2847.38] You know what?
[2847.38 → 2849.68] Most people would be more forgiving than me.
[2849.76 → 2851.38] I actually said, wait, what did I say?
[2851.64 → 2852.58] You saw me click, right?
[2852.72 → 2853.40] You said 10 years.
[2853.40 → 2853.98] Did I say 10?
[2854.20 → 2854.94] I actually said 10.
[2854.94 → 2858.30] I wafted between five and 10 for a while, and then I eventually went with 10.
[2859.34 → 2859.98] And you know what?
[2860.02 → 2863.84] Because I had, like my S3 lasted for a long time.
[2864.68 → 2865.24] You know what?
[2865.24 → 2868.22] I'm going to throw this, I'm going to throw this in the YouTube chat now.
[2869.18 → 2869.84] And Twitch.
[2869.84 → 2870.80] Wait, I don't even know.
[2870.80 → 2872.40] I don't even know where Twitch chat is.
[2872.66 → 2873.32] I'll get Twitch.
[2873.70 → 2874.04] Okay.
[2874.44 → 2876.20] I had actually forgotten about Twitch.
[2876.30 → 2876.96] I'm sorry, Twitch.
[2877.66 → 2878.14] Oof.
[2878.38 → 2878.70] Oof.
[2879.14 → 2879.62] Oof.
[2879.74 → 2880.18] Oof.
[2880.70 → 2881.58] Sorry, Twitch.
[2882.96 → 2884.52] So, wow.
[2884.64 → 2890.54] Yeah, I really thought that people were just going to be like, yeah, they should just support
[2890.54 → 2891.10] things forever.
[2891.30 → 2897.00] But it looks like we've actually got some network security minded people.
[2897.28 → 2899.28] And that's probably the math that's being done.
[2899.28 → 2905.20] That go, okay, all these things are developing so fast that like 10 years in network equipment
[2905.20 → 2907.20] terms is like an eternity.
[2907.42 → 2909.18] That's why I picked 10 years.
[2909.20 → 2909.70] Web security.
[2909.80 → 2911.76] It's a very, very long time.
[2911.94 → 2912.88] That's forever.
[2913.08 → 2915.32] How many people actually use that?
[2915.38 → 2916.76] What phone did you have 10 years ago?
[2916.86 → 2921.38] How many of you are using a router that is 10 years old?
[2921.74 → 2923.44] Like a WRT54GL.
[2923.62 → 2926.16] Like how many of you are actually still using that?
[2927.28 → 2928.54] Probably not many.
[2928.54 → 2931.40] My parents' WRT300N just died.
[2931.96 → 2932.08] Yeah.
[2932.16 → 2934.94] And that was quite about, that was like four years later.
[2935.06 → 2935.28] Yeah.
[2935.46 → 2935.62] Yeah.
[2935.78 → 2943.32] So, and then I think it seems to me that a lot of you were actually doing the math going,
[2943.50 → 2948.24] well, they're not providing security updates for it anymore after three to five.
[2948.62 → 2951.58] So, honestly, I don't want that on my network.
[2951.58 → 2954.58] Well, even just think about the phone you had 10 years ago.
[2954.58 → 2956.68] Like what?
[2957.08 → 2959.14] I had this, I think it was from Sony.
[2959.24 → 2959.60] I don't even remember.
[2959.66 → 2961.10] It was this white like slider phone.
[2961.20 → 2961.44] I don't.
[2961.44 → 2963.10] Now, this is interesting.
[2963.30 → 2968.82] The broader YouTube population has now started to weigh in, and the five-year option is actually
[2968.82 → 2970.30] losing some steam.
[2970.30 → 2970.70] Yeah.
[2970.70 → 2970.76] Yeah.
[2970.82 → 2974.72] We've got more people saying indefinite, and we've got a lot more people coming in and saying
[2974.72 → 2975.38] 10 years.
[2975.90 → 2976.30] But I...
[2976.30 → 2978.04] We had said 10 years though.
[2978.04 → 2978.48] We did.
[2978.60 → 2980.76] I actually want to, I want to take back my vote.
[2981.32 → 2983.78] Um, I want to, I want to take back my vote.
[2983.84 → 2985.10] I want to say five years now.
[2985.44 → 2987.36] Like I said, I waft between the two.
[2987.50 → 2989.50] If not like six, not 10.
[2989.60 → 2989.88] Yeah.
[2990.22 → 2995.90] I think five, I think five is a little bit too short for me because like I said, I had
[2995.90 → 2997.78] my S3 for, I think like four.
[2998.56 → 2998.76] Yeah.
[2998.76 → 3000.92] Like it was still kind of fine.
[3001.14 → 3002.96] But it probably wasn't secure.
[3003.14 → 3003.58] No.
[3003.86 → 3005.92] Now, here's the thing.
[3005.92 → 3013.00] I think what some people aren't considering is that, excuse me, is that even if the manufacturer
[3013.00 → 3018.60] removes the networking capabilities, I think there might be a middle ground here for us.
[3019.04 → 3024.04] Like honestly, something that I've really felt that the Android in particular, I mean,
[3024.14 → 3027.80] you're never going to convince Apple of something like this, but that I've really felt that the
[3027.80 → 3033.64] Android scene should have is far better after market support for these mobile devices.
[3033.64 → 3035.50] And I don't expect every feature to work.
[3035.50 → 3041.26] You know, I don't expect an old Samsung Galaxy Note device to have all the little special
[3041.26 → 3043.42] stylus functionality and stuff like that.
[3043.80 → 3050.50] But if we went, okay, in terms of the manufacturer's OS, they can turn off your networking capability.
[3050.50 → 3057.14] But if you can find a currently patched OS, I would like for manufacturers to have to also
[3057.14 → 3058.98] open that option up to you at that time.
[3059.46 → 3065.62] So if we created legislation that basically said, okay, after five years, this thing is
[3065.62 → 3067.92] not your problem or six, let's say.
[3068.18 → 3069.74] Let's compromise a little bit here.
[3069.74 → 3074.38] After six years, this thing is straight up not your problem, but you have to unlock the bootloader.
[3074.38 → 3082.38] You have to allow third-party software to work on it so that people can restore basic functionality or so that they can be not recycled.
[3082.38 → 3087.50] Recycling electronics is actually like horrible compared to reusing them.
[3087.50 → 3097.86] So that they could be repurposed in a developing country or for your kids or whatever else in some functional way, as long as you're willing to put the time and the effort into it.
[3098.10 → 3100.00] That, I think, is a reasonable compromise.
[3100.22 → 3101.10] That I'm totally down with.
[3101.10 → 3115.94] Especially because five years ago, maybe not even five years ago, like the early smartphones, like a Galaxy S Vibrant or an iPhone 3GS or something, they are like terrible by 10 years later standards.
[3116.90 → 3126.40] But I would make the argument that something like a Google Nexus 5 with a more basic OS on it for sure, like a lighter version of Android on it.
[3126.40 → 3133.78] But I would make the argument that something like a Nexus 5 would probably be quite usable by comparison 10 years after its launch.
[3134.22 → 3140.28] So this is a problem that, honestly, I think we do need to solve and relatively soon.
[3140.72 → 3142.70] So this was the float plane results.
[3143.12 → 3143.74] Oh, okay, cool.
[3143.86 → 3150.78] So we actually, most of the gains that, or most of the losses in five years were made up in indefinite, actually.
[3151.84 → 3153.22] And 10 years.
[3153.36 → 3153.56] Oh, wait.
[3153.62 → 3153.94] Oh, sorry.
[3154.02 → 3154.98] The order was reversed.
[3155.08 → 3155.64] So both of them.
[3155.74 → 3155.94] Yes.
[3156.38 → 3156.58] Yeah.
[3156.72 → 3157.22] So 10 years.
[3157.22 → 3159.88] 10 years gained, but lost to indefinite.
[3160.00 → 3161.14] Indefinite gained a ton.
[3161.36 → 3161.56] Yeah.
[3161.92 → 3163.74] 10 years gained 4% though.
[3163.82 → 3164.40] That's not a small one.
[3164.40 → 3166.68] Still no one was interested in 15 years.
[3166.94 → 3167.12] No.
[3167.12 → 3167.94] On either side.
[3168.00 → 3168.14] No.
[3170.42 → 3170.86] Fascinating.
[3171.00 → 3171.88] That blew my mind.
[3171.98 → 3174.32] I did not expect those results at all.
[3174.86 → 3175.94] Even the YouTube one.
[3176.48 → 3178.28] I don't remember how we got on this topic.
[3179.88 → 3181.54] Oh, boy.
[3181.80 → 3182.60] Oh, this is great.
[3182.80 → 3183.06] You know what?
[3183.06 → 3183.64] I'll be right back.
[3183.74 → 3185.56] Can you, can you like just cover the basic?
[3185.56 → 3187.10] The basic newness of this?
[3187.10 → 3187.40] Yes.
[3187.48 → 3187.74] Okay.
[3187.78 → 3188.26] I'll be right back.
[3188.32 → 3188.88] This is fantastic.
[3188.88 → 3191.42] I lost my perpetual doc somehow, so I'm going to use Linus'.
[3191.42 → 3199.02] Red removes mention of Hydrogen One modules from website, which is fascinating because
[3199.02 → 3206.84] we've never seen a company promise that there would be additional modules for a product and then not deliver those modules ever before.
[3206.94 → 3208.38] They have always delivered those modules.
[3208.38 → 3210.90] And they continue to invest R&D in them.
[3210.90 → 3217.78] And they have continued to invest R&D in them for an extensive period of time, releasing tons of add-ons for a product.
[3217.78 → 3219.68] I've got tons that really matter.
[3219.68 → 3220.68] Yeah.
[3220.68 → 3226.84] Really adding a lot of value, really giving you those modules that you were like, this is why I'm buying the product.
[3227.96 → 3230.92] That's what everyone does who promise additional things.
[3231.12 → 3233.04] That happens every time.
[3233.38 → 3233.94] A hundred percent.
[3234.24 → 3236.46] Those companies that are like, yeah, we're going to make this thing.
[3236.52 → 3239.36] It's going to be the last one you ever need because you can swap things out.
[3239.46 → 3240.22] You can upgrade it.
[3240.24 → 3240.84] You can change it.
[3240.88 → 3241.54] You can do all that kind of stuff.
[3241.72 → 3244.14] But you just need to buy the core thing every time it happens.
[3244.14 → 3245.80] Can I detect a note of sarcasm?
[3246.02 → 3246.84] No, not at all.
[3247.06 → 3247.28] No.
[3248.36 → 3250.92] Because I'm pretty sure I detect a note of sarcasm.
[3251.20 → 3251.90] What are you looking for?
[3251.96 → 3252.32] The hydrogen?
[3252.52 → 3254.56] I'm looking for the titanium hydrogen one.
[3254.64 → 3256.38] It finally arrived like two weeks ago.
[3257.04 → 3257.68] And, uh...
[3257.68 → 3259.00] I think it's on Nick's desk.
[3259.12 → 3259.90] On Nick's desk?
[3260.04 → 3262.60] I saw it there before the move, so I don't know if it's still there or not.
[3262.74 → 3263.38] Oh, man.
[3264.16 → 3264.68] All right.
[3264.78 → 3266.02] Well, maybe I get...
[3266.02 → 3266.30] Oh, wait.
[3266.32 → 3266.72] Is this it?
[3267.36 → 3269.02] No, it's a razor phone or something.
[3269.54 → 3270.24] Oh, man.
[3270.42 → 3270.78] Okay.
[3271.46 → 3272.78] Well, sorry, guys.
[3272.78 → 3274.02] Um...
[3274.02 → 3275.62] This is just the least surprising news.
[3275.68 → 3282.18] I had wanted to do a live unboxing of my titanium paperweight red hydrogen one titanium edition.
[3282.62 → 3284.42] Because they finally shipped those.
[3284.96 → 3287.30] And, uh, just in time for them to say,
[3287.52 → 3289.40] Oh, we made an Sophie.
[3289.52 → 3290.84] This is really stupid.
[3291.28 → 3291.88] Um...
[3291.88 → 3296.48] Making a first-gen product that, like, is going to sell a handful.
[3296.58 → 3297.18] Because here's the thing.
[3297.38 → 3298.48] I've worked in retail.
[3298.78 → 3300.66] I know what attach rates are like.
[3300.66 → 3302.02] Do you know what an attachment rate is?
[3302.02 → 3305.26] I'm assuming when you buy the extra things for something.
[3305.28 → 3305.66] That's right.
[3305.78 → 3305.90] Yeah.
[3306.06 → 3310.78] So the attachment rate is the percentage of the people who come in and buy one of these who
[3310.78 → 3313.60] also walk out of the store with one of these, for example.
[3313.60 → 3316.22] This one comes with the pen, so it's not really a great example.
[3316.22 → 3317.68] But I think you get my point.
[3319.06 → 3320.32] Attach rates are pretty low.
[3321.56 → 3322.76] Especially online.
[3322.76 → 3329.30] So at retail, uh, stores like Best Buy will train their sales reps, or what do they call
[3329.30 → 3329.48] them?
[3329.84 → 3330.70] The blue shirts.
[3331.52 → 3331.76] Sure.
[3331.76 → 3336.10] They'll train their sales staff to, to, to really push attach rates hard.
[3336.14 → 3338.72] Because a lot of the time, that's where the store makes their margin.
[3338.72 → 3339.28] Oh, yeah, yeah.
[3339.28 → 3344.96] There is so much more margin in a, you know, an Apple Pencil than there is in an iPad.
[3345.22 → 3346.18] A controller versus a console.
[3346.42 → 3347.48] I guarantee it.
[3347.66 → 3348.42] And this is Apple.
[3348.58 → 3350.66] They make plenty margin on their iPads too.
[3351.18 → 3353.84] Um, because they're, they're, they're, they're, they're smaller.
[3354.22 → 3355.06] There are less materials.
[3355.16 → 3355.96] There's less complexity.
[3355.96 → 3362.08] And, of course, they are still quite expensive because they have a lot of value.
[3362.08 → 3365.82] So they're worth more, even though they don't actually cost more to make.
[3366.58 → 3370.36] Um, so attach rates, though, are typically very low.
[3370.44 → 3377.10] Like, you're doing well if you're more than low double digits in terms of attach rate for
[3377.10 → 3377.60] a product.
[3377.82 → 3379.50] Now, there are exceptions to that.
[3379.62 → 3381.50] Things like the Microsoft Surface Pro.
[3381.60 → 3385.30] My understanding is that the attachment rate for a keyboard is extraordinarily high.
[3385.30 → 3387.32] Because the thing is bloody useless without it.
[3387.40 → 3389.76] Because it's Windows on a tablet.
[3390.06 → 3391.98] Like, what are you going to do?
[3392.16 → 3396.80] So people basically just factor the price of one of these keyboards into the Surface Pro.
[3397.60 → 3397.72] But.
[3397.74 → 3398.82] Do they bundle it as well?
[3399.42 → 3399.76] Um.
[3399.78 → 3401.38] Okay, question for, for you.
[3401.66 → 3403.80] Is a bundle still considered an attachment rate?
[3404.00 → 3404.72] Yeah, it would be.
[3405.10 → 3407.88] Um, but it depends on sort of how it's positioned.
[3408.08 → 3408.32] Okay.
[3408.32 → 3415.22] So, I would say that something like an iPad bundled with a pencil is increasing your
[3415.22 → 3415.82] attach rate.
[3415.98 → 3419.54] Whereas a Surface Pro bundled with a keyboard is like, that should have just been included
[3419.54 → 3420.36] in the first place.
[3420.56 → 3420.76] Okay.
[3420.82 → 3426.16] Basically, all you're really doing is giving the consumer the option of which keyboard they'd
[3426.16 → 3426.80] like it with.
[3426.94 → 3432.94] And not having to create, like, an exponentially larger number of SKUs in order to support all
[3432.94 → 3433.58] the configurations.
[3433.78 → 3438.14] Would you also differentiate between if it's, and this might throw off for a second, but
[3438.14 → 3439.00] if it's in the box or not.
[3439.00 → 3443.26] What I mean by that is when you buy, like, a console, and it comes with a game in the
[3443.26 → 3443.60] box.
[3444.06 → 3445.90] No, I would consider that a bundle.
[3446.12 → 3446.86] That's a product.
[3447.06 → 3447.24] Okay.
[3447.48 → 3452.58] Yeah, you only sold an Xbox because usually you're not paying extra, or you're not paying
[3452.58 → 3453.92] a lot extra for that game.
[3453.92 → 3456.30] And, or it'll come with additional value.
[3456.30 → 3460.18] So, it's hard to figure out what the consumer assigned the value to.
[3460.30 → 3466.80] For example, there were a Gears of War Xbox One S that did come with Gears of War, but
[3466.80 → 3472.18] it also was red and, like, looked cool and came with, like, a red controller that looked
[3472.18 → 3472.44] cool.
[3472.44 → 3475.58] One of the coolest Xbox controllers, like, ever because it has the claw marks in it.
[3475.66 → 3480.26] So, it's hard to decide if someone, someone might already own the game.
[3480.26 → 3484.70] In fact, if there are big Gears of Worm, Gears of Worm, if there are big Gears of War
[3484.70 → 3490.44] Nut, they probably already pre-ordered the game and, or had an Xbox already.
[3490.56 → 3497.88] Like, this is just, it's more like a collector's item and less like an actual Xbox One and game
[3497.88 → 3497.94] and controller.
[3497.94 → 3503.06] I've always found that kind of weird because they seem to sell pretty well, I guess, because
[3503.06 → 3504.48] they do them all the time.
[3504.52 → 3505.68] I've never seen one, though.
[3506.48 → 3507.92] And that's the thing.
[3507.92 → 3510.24] It's one of those weird ones like an Alienware desktop.
[3511.02 → 3514.58] Theoretically, people are buying these, but I've never seen one at a LAN party.
[3514.92 → 3515.12] Yeah.
[3516.28 → 3520.06] Although, to be fair, a lot of times LAN party PCs are, like, a lot lower tier than you'd
[3520.06 → 3520.36] expect.
[3520.42 → 3520.96] Fair enough.
[3522.10 → 3523.86] That was kind of surprising to me, too.
[3523.98 → 3524.40] Yeah, me too.
[3524.52 → 3525.64] But, um...
[3525.64 → 3528.36] I showed up with, like, all my water cooling and stuff at, like...
[3528.36 → 3529.36] I was like, oh, okay.
[3529.36 → 3529.62] Oh.
[3529.70 → 3532.74] I guess gamers and computer enthusiasts...
[3532.74 → 3534.38] Don't necessarily overlap as much as you think.
[3534.38 → 3535.54] They overlap, but not as much as I thought.
[3535.54 → 3535.86] Yeah.
[3535.86 → 3536.28] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3536.64 → 3542.66] The amount of, like, hacked out HP computer that doesn't have any of the panels anymore
[3542.66 → 3545.12] and is, like, in 14 layers of dust.
[3545.54 → 3548.12] It's, like, such a high percentage of LAN party PCs.
[3548.28 → 3548.56] Yes.
[3548.66 → 3552.40] And the number of those people that are shocked that I'm so bad at video games...
[3552.40 → 3555.42] I'm saying this street probably goes both ways.
[3556.36 → 3556.94] That's funny.
[3557.30 → 3557.86] Um...
[3557.86 → 3559.28] All right.
[3559.80 → 3562.88] Uh, well, I guess that's pretty much it for WAN Show, because we have a stream...
[3562.88 → 3564.04] Another stream to go set up.
[3564.16 → 3564.42] Yeah.
[3564.56 → 3565.22] Can we play some Bro force?
[3565.54 → 3565.84] Yeah.
[3565.94 → 3569.00] I mean, we will have lost our save file?
[3569.08 → 3570.36] No, because I can just log in to save.
[3570.36 → 3570.42] Cloud save.
[3570.62 → 3570.82] Cool.
[3570.96 → 3571.14] Yeah.
[3571.26 → 3571.58] Heck yeah.
[3571.80 → 3572.16] Yeah.
[3572.52 → 3572.88] Yeah.
[3573.40 → 3573.84] Yeah, bro.
[3574.42 → 3574.78] All right.
[3574.96 → 3575.46] Let's go, bro.
[3575.98 → 3577.00] Uh, so we'll see you guys later.
[3577.20 → 3577.46] Bye.
[3577.46 → 3577.58] Bye.
[3577.58 → 3577.66] Bye.
[3577.66 → 3577.68] Bye.
[3577.68 → 3579.40] High researched.
[3586.94 → 3587.34] Bye.
[3591.40 → 3591.58] Alright.
[3591.70 → 3593.58] cheaters.
