[0.00 → 0.92] At Luke Laugher.
[2.98 → 3.92] All right, guys.
[4.02 → 4.98] Welcome to the WAN show.
[5.08 → 6.86] Got another great show for you guys.
[7.06 → 9.90] I'm sure we've done a great show once before at the very least.
[10.04 → 10.62] Oh, wow.
[10.68 → 12.66] They turned around the screen on the camera.
[12.76 → 13.90] That's going to be really distracting.
[14.34 → 14.94] That's kind of weird.
[15.06 → 15.88] I don't think I can.
[15.96 → 17.48] I don't think I can not look at it.
[18.02 → 19.08] Hey, one of the.
[19.66 → 20.76] Hey, thanks, David.
[21.00 → 22.24] What's wrong with looking at it?
[22.52 → 25.28] Well, no, if you look at it, then you're going to look slightly off.
[25.36 → 27.86] Yeah, it's kind of like if you're having a conversation with someone like this.
[27.86 → 29.20] Like, hi, James.
[29.36 → 30.08] How are you today?
[30.20 → 33.34] But it's also kind of weird if you just look into the lens too much for too long.
[33.42 → 34.38] People get mad at that, too.
[34.52 → 34.92] No.
[35.52 → 36.86] They yelled at me once on a video.
[36.94 → 38.12] Who gets mad about that?
[38.32 → 38.78] Yeah, okay.
[39.06 → 41.78] Well, what happened was I was trying to read the script.
[42.08 → 44.88] And it was the first time that it wasn't a tech link or a tech wiki.
[45.02 → 47.04] And I actually had to interact with the product I was using.
[47.18 → 49.86] So I was trying to read the Teleprompter, which is right in front of the lens.
[50.00 → 53.50] And then I was trying to look away sometimes at the thing and hold it and present it.
[53.50 → 59.62] And I was not skilled enough to go from that back to my spot on the scrolling text.
[60.02 → 61.62] And so I kept screwing up.
[61.70 → 64.86] So when the final edit came through and the editor was done putting it all together,
[64.94 → 69.64] all the takes that worked, every take that worked was one where I looked right in the lens without blinking.
[70.06 → 70.50] So the final...
[70.50 → 71.00] Hi, everyone.
[71.18 → 72.72] I am talking about this product.
[72.88 → 73.90] I am not a robot.
[74.08 → 74.72] I am a who man.
[74.82 → 77.38] The final video was super penetrating.
[77.38 → 82.68] And like, all the comments were like, man, you need to look away once in a while, blink once in a while.
[83.20 → 83.98] I was trying, guys.
[84.10 → 85.16] Okay, I can see that.
[85.34 → 87.48] But WAN shows a more conversational format.
[87.62 → 89.58] So this is one of those things where...
[89.58 → 90.18] Sorry, guys.
[90.22 → 92.64] We will really get to topics relatively quickly today.
[92.78 → 93.78] But we're...
[93.78 → 94.22] Sorry.
[94.76 → 96.78] Look, the show is having a conversation, okay?
[96.84 → 98.66] So it's one of those things where it's context dependent.
[98.80 → 101.62] So depending on what type of video it is,
[101.84 → 105.44] sometimes it's really important to maintain eye contact the whole time.
[105.44 → 108.32] Like when I was working on the video this week about the Red Meg's.
[108.94 → 116.14] That was the kind of video where because I am having a conversation with the person across the table from me
[116.14 → 120.86] who just happens to be a camera, it's important to maintain eye contact because, guys,
[120.92 → 122.22] we're trying to have a real chat here.
[122.48 → 124.20] We're trying to demystify something.
[124.28 → 125.92] Especially if it's a more sensitive video.
[126.10 → 129.74] Like after your, I don't know, iPhone 10 or something review,
[130.26 → 134.64] when you made a subsequent video that was like, look, we kind of screwed up in these ways.
[134.64 → 137.36] I didn't want the video to come out the way it did come out.
[137.42 → 139.52] And you're having like a frank discussion with the audience.
[139.72 → 139.96] Yes.
[140.62 → 142.16] It's important to maintain eye contact.
[142.32 → 144.10] It's just, it's a matter of respect.
[144.52 → 151.08] Whereas when you are, like when you're, like if you can imagine something that was like more of a
[151.08 → 156.46] like a narrative type content where the characters are interacting with each other.
[156.46 → 158.60] And it's like, hi, James.
[158.74 → 161.50] It sure is a pleasure to be meeting with you here today.
[161.68 → 162.36] That's right, Linus.
[162.62 → 166.24] I can't wait to have a show where we actually talk about tech.
[166.52 → 168.24] So it's all, it's all context dependent.
[168.36 → 170.36] So we do have a bunch of great topics for you guys today.
[170.92 → 177.28] Amazon accidentally sold $13,000 plus camera gear for $100 on Prime Day,
[177.44 → 179.66] which wouldn't be much of a WAN show topic.
[179.66 → 181.12] There wouldn't be a lot of discussion there,
[181.20 → 185.92] except that I can actually talk about my experience being on the other end,
[186.36 → 188.66] as opposed to the consumer who got a great deal,
[189.08 → 193.38] being the product manager who accidentally priced something for one-tenth of what it was supposed to be.
[194.02 → 195.38] So we'll discuss that.
[195.54 → 199.76] We've also got Neuralink, Elon Musk's brain interface company,
[200.08 → 201.74] applying to the FDA for human trials.
[201.86 → 202.52] I already have mine.
[202.60 → 203.42] He wants to wear that.
[203.42 → 208.98] Are you saying you want me to cover up my World's Greatest Dad shirt?
[210.48 → 213.26] We've got the World's First and Second-Greatest Dad shirt.
[213.28 → 215.88] There are some people in this office that find that t-shirt offensive.
[217.22 → 220.18] Like if you got one for me too, and we could both wear it,
[220.18 → 224.98] if we were co-World's Greatest Dad, I might feel slightly less personally attacked.
[225.06 → 226.00] There's only one greatest.
[227.62 → 228.38] One goat.
[228.38 → 234.20] And we're also going to cover Facebook's finally getting the fine of $5 billion.
[234.60 → 237.00] Well, actually they're not, but that's the announced amount.
[237.58 → 239.98] It still hasn't gone through, but $5 billion.
[240.44 → 241.64] Let's see if that number matters.
[241.72 → 242.14] Roll the intro.
[242.26 → 242.74] Roll the intro.
[247.14 → 248.62] It's lagging apparently again.
[249.08 → 250.16] I just don't get it.
[250.34 → 252.46] We streamed for half an hour on the test channel.
[255.66 → 257.54] Yeah, please do, because this is getting ridiculous.
[258.38 → 264.40] Like we can't be using this exact computer to stream on the test channel and then have...
[264.40 → 264.88] Let's go space.
[265.66 → 267.82] That doesn't make any sense.
[268.16 → 274.06] For those of you watching on YouTube, we would strongly recommend heading over to twitch.tv slash Linus Tech.
[274.28 → 274.72] Can't do that.
[274.86 → 275.74] Yes, I can.
[275.82 → 276.72] I can do that.
[276.86 → 280.20] If YouTube can't figure out their live-streaming, then people can go watch on Twitch.
[280.28 → 281.32] The stream's fine over there.
[281.76 → 283.04] So we're multi-streaming.
[283.16 → 287.48] We did a half an hour-long test on our other channel, and it was fine.
[287.48 → 289.82] So honestly, I don't know what to tell you guys.
[289.92 → 293.38] We have no idea what the problem is, but it's clearly not our internet.
[293.38 → 300.46] Clearly not our rest reaming service, because that's working to Twitch on this one and to our test YouTube channel.
[302.02 → 303.56] And so, yeah, we don't know.
[303.62 → 305.34] We've got the settings identical between them.
[305.90 → 307.78] It's apparently only some people.
[308.02 → 310.10] So there's people in chat that are saying there's no lag.
[310.10 → 315.06] So all I can tell you guys is if you are experiencing lag, twitch.tv slash Linus Tech.
[315.50 → 317.72] We're also having some lag issues on Float plane.
[317.82 → 318.64] Those are unrelated.
[318.82 → 319.94] Those are Float plane related.
[320.08 → 327.12] We have to change from Nimble Video Streamer to a different one, because basically there's too many of you now.
[327.52 → 329.78] And we have to make something new.
[329.78 → 338.10] So thanks much for your support is pretty much what I'm...
[338.10 → 339.90] Tell your friends, but get them to trickle in.
[340.24 → 340.48] Yeah.
[341.76 → 344.40] Luke's going to have some really cool Float plane news next week.
[344.46 → 350.06] But for now, I think the best thing that we can do is jump right into our highlight topic for the week,
[350.52 → 355.28] which is, of course, the pricing errors on Amazon's Prime Day.
[355.30 → 357.92] Now, this isn't something you noticed when you guys were doing your Prime Day stream.
[357.92 → 359.30] No, it wasn't.
[359.58 → 361.56] Did you cover any camera gear?
[361.78 → 362.66] No, we didn't.
[362.74 → 366.26] So this was posted by R.C. Mayer, I think is how I pronounce it on the phone.
[366.26 → 366.96] I'd like to just...
[366.96 → 367.18] Mayer?
[367.40 → 371.10] Just for the record, you have one of my most hated names on the forum.
[371.20 → 371.58] I do?
[371.76 → 373.24] No, this guy, this person.
[373.30 → 374.60] I was like, it's just my name.
[374.62 → 375.42] I'm doing the WAND.
[375.48 → 376.70] Why can't you stop...
[376.70 → 378.30] Why won't you stop attacking me?
[379.56 → 381.14] You're a bad dad.
[381.44 → 382.76] You have a crap name.
[382.82 → 383.58] You're not a bad dad.
[383.88 → 385.76] You're just not the world's greatest anymore.
[386.30 → 387.16] All right, so sorry.
[387.16 → 388.10] I've been doing it for three weeks now.
[388.30 → 389.38] You hate R.C. Mayer.
[390.40 → 394.52] I've been doing the WAND doc for like a year and a half or something like that, or maybe
[394.52 → 395.20] even two years.
[395.52 → 401.82] And this person posts all the time, and I still have to spell and like look and spell the name.
[401.94 → 403.80] It just makes no sense in my mind.
[404.18 → 406.10] I can't remember how to spell it ever.
[406.56 → 407.22] So thanks, dude.
[407.70 → 409.64] Maybe it's R.C. May HL.
[410.42 → 412.12] You know, like maybe we're missing something here.
[412.12 → 414.50] Anyway, do you want to run us through what happened?
[415.28 → 420.86] So on Prime Day, some users, not everybody, but some people saw weird prices for lots of
[420.86 → 421.52] different camera gear.
[421.66 → 422.98] And this is on the same item.
[423.34 → 426.14] Like two different people would see a different price for the same item?
[426.64 → 430.32] They all saw the same price, but it wasn't the intended price.
[430.68 → 431.12] Got it.
[431.12 → 435.16] So it started out on one item in particular, and then people noticed that it was actually
[435.16 → 436.16] on lots of different items.
[436.40 → 439.14] And it was always the price of $94.48.
[439.62 → 439.90] Right.
[440.38 → 445.30] And then so there's a forum that a lot of these like deal seekers use called Slick Deals.
[445.54 → 447.32] Slick Deals has been around forever, actually.
[448.08 → 449.42] You can get Slick Deals over there.
[449.54 → 450.10] The slickest.
[450.34 → 451.12] You know what's funny?
[451.12 → 453.86] I'm going to totally derail you here because I'm rude like that.
[454.34 → 456.14] We had thought about creating.
[456.24 → 459.04] You know how Linus Tech Tips doesn't have an award program?
[459.04 → 461.58] Like we don't have like a...
[461.58 → 462.44] Like a loyalty program.
[462.62 → 463.70] No, no, no, no.
[463.78 → 465.44] Not a rewards program.
[465.74 → 467.56] We don't have an award program.
[467.68 → 469.18] Like when we review something.
[469.50 → 469.76] Oh, yeah.
[469.76 → 472.24] We won't be like four and a half stars out of five.
[472.48 → 473.40] Recommend to buy.
[473.50 → 475.60] And like we don't have like a little badge design for that.
[475.74 → 476.74] I just, I don't know.
[476.76 → 478.52] It's always felt kind of silly to me, and we don't do it.
[478.64 → 484.16] But we had considered doing one at one point just because we had the best possible names
[484.16 → 485.76] for what the awards would be.
[485.88 → 487.92] So Luke and I were each going to have separate ones.
[487.92 → 490.46] And it was going to be...
[490.46 → 491.26] I can already imagine.
[491.26 → 492.64] There was going to be this list, okay?
[493.42 → 498.52] Linus's likes with like a thumbs up like modelled after a Facebook style thing.
[498.70 → 500.16] And then Slick's deals.
[500.58 → 501.68] Oh, that's pretty good.
[501.96 → 506.72] So we figured like, okay, if we were going to have an award program, it would have to
[506.72 → 507.76] be cringy like that.
[507.82 → 509.26] But then we just kind of never got it off the ground.
[509.36 → 510.38] Anyway, carry on.
[510.46 → 511.08] Yes, Slick deals.
[511.22 → 511.96] It's a website.
[512.14 → 515.76] Yeah, they posted on the forum there and then it kind of spread and lots of people got in
[515.76 → 518.10] on it.
[518.10 → 520.02] And some people's orders have been fulfilled.
[520.38 → 525.70] So some people realized that they were getting Slick deals and tried to make the best of it.
[525.74 → 526.68] Like there was this one guy.
[527.40 → 532.42] He bought like $10,000 worth of stuff for $900 worth of real money.
[532.42 → 536.90] And then some of it got actually delivered to him.
[537.34 → 542.90] But what happened was Amazon itself with a completely separate system flagged his credit
[542.90 → 546.46] card because they thought someone was using it maliciously.
[546.58 → 548.86] Like just, you've never bought 10 cameras before.
[548.96 → 549.88] So they shut it down.
[550.16 → 551.70] So only some of the stuff in his cart.
[552.48 → 556.70] I think maybe he did one order, and then he made a new cart and then that one didn't get
[556.70 → 557.02] fulfilled.
[557.02 → 559.58] So he got kind of stymied for a different reason.
[559.88 → 563.32] But yeah, some people got off with a ton of sweet gear.
[564.30 → 572.86] So there are things like Sony A6000 kits, A6500s, 10 to 18 millimetre bundle, a $2,000 Sony
[572.86 → 575.12] A7 body, Sony A9.
[575.28 → 575.78] Holy crap.
[575.78 → 576.48] All of this stuff.
[576.66 → 581.88] Apparently there was like a $13,000 big, one of those giant lenses that people use to zoom
[581.88 → 582.44] in on birds.
[582.90 → 584.38] All of this stuff for like $94.
[584.38 → 587.18] Holy crap.
[587.50 → 593.84] I mean, to be clear, the person talking about the $13,000 lens wrote that, oh no, another
[593.84 → 595.94] member wrote regarding their Canon EF.
[596.10 → 597.20] Oh no, this is 800 millimeters.
[597.34 → 597.48] Yep.
[598.00 → 602.14] Waiting for the cancellation, but that's like 99% off.
[603.12 → 608.74] Others reported that they successfully price matched gear at retailers like Best Buy and
[608.74 → 608.92] Walmart.
[608.92 → 609.26] That's crazy.
[609.72 → 610.02] So.
[610.16 → 610.72] That is crazy.
[610.72 → 615.46] Because I have seen other times when on, I think it was like a Boxing Day thing.
[615.56 → 615.76] Yep.
[615.98 → 622.22] Where someone had a crazy deal and then the other local retailers just said, no, we're
[622.22 → 622.70] not doing it.
[622.74 → 623.28] It's too crazy.
[623.66 → 623.78] Yeah.
[623.78 → 624.40] They wouldn't order.
[624.52 → 626.22] They wouldn't match it even though it was their policy.
[626.22 → 635.28] So going back to my days as a product manager at an online retailer, one of my big mistakes
[635.28 → 641.70] early on in my career as a product manager was actually on a Mountain Mods case.
[641.78 → 642.94] I remember it pretty well.
[642.94 → 647.24] And I was pretty new to the product management team.
[647.44 → 653.86] I only had basically the only product lines that I was allowed to handle were the ones
[653.86 → 657.12] that were not really worth anyone else's time.
[657.12 → 659.32] Like they were either very high touch.
[659.98 → 666.32] So very, very time-consuming with a lot of like nitpicky, stupid crap or very low margin
[666.32 → 672.42] or like completely deadlines that someone else had like just abandoned and just didn't feel
[672.42 → 673.12] like dealing with anymore.
[673.22 → 676.02] So they just kind of got shed over to me.
[676.14 → 677.62] That's how you get baptized in fire.
[678.14 → 679.02] Pretty much.
[679.06 → 685.76] Like I started out trying to make a name for myself with water cooling and like weird fringe
[685.76 → 688.50] vendors and Mountain Mods was one of them.
[688.56 → 690.30] So here, I'm just going to switch over to my screen here.
[690.78 → 692.58] So Mountain Mods actually still exists.
[692.58 → 698.36] And it's hilarious that Case Labs made so much noise about how their designs got ripped
[698.36 → 705.36] off by Thermal take because to my knowledge, now I could be wrong, correct me in the chat.
[705.62 → 711.40] But as far as I know, Mountain Mods has been around a heck of a lot longer than Case Labs.
[711.72 → 714.92] And they are the original cube case.
[715.32 → 720.22] I feel like if there's some kind of like tech, like the force, like Star Wars force, you can
[720.22 → 724.54] sense all the keyboards around the world clacking right now to try to investigate this for
[724.54 → 724.76] us.
[725.38 → 726.34] Someone's going to have an answer.
[726.82 → 727.32] I know, right?
[727.40 → 732.08] So Mountain Mods, it was one of their Ascension cases, I think.
[732.54 → 735.26] Basically, they're like kind of modular case maker.
[735.74 → 741.98] And the big problem for them was that their shipping prices into Canada sucked donkey balls.
[741.98 → 748.48] So any Canadians that wanted to buy a Mountain Mods case couldn't really get one at a reasonable
[748.48 → 753.88] price because they're already super expensive because they're made in the U.S. still, to
[753.88 → 757.30] my knowledge, including the actual metal fabrication and powder coating.
[758.36 → 758.84] It looks heavy.
[759.34 → 763.26] And they are heavily kind of customizable.
[763.80 → 764.60] They're actually not that heavy.
[764.68 → 765.06] They're aluminum.
[765.62 → 767.16] So they're heavily customizable.
[767.94 → 768.78] They're big.
[769.26 → 770.60] And they ship pre-assembled.
[770.68 → 772.28] So they're like freaking huge.
[772.50 → 774.88] And all the accessories are like super expensive.
[775.06 → 776.78] And there's all these different options.
[777.46 → 780.30] And shipping cross-border was a little bit tougher back then.
[780.38 → 781.94] Man, their sight still sucks.
[782.56 → 783.42] Okay, there we go.
[783.42 → 785.74] Okay, so let's just grab like a U2.
[785.88 → 788.92] U2 UFO is kind of like their OG case.
[789.00 → 790.16] It's changed a lot over the years.
[790.16 → 795.18] But I'm willing to bet the pictures on here are from like the Enforce 2 days.
[795.34 → 796.94] Like it really wouldn't surprise me.
[797.60 → 799.20] Look how slow this freaking site is.
[799.24 → 801.06] Though you guys might be love-hugging it right now.
[802.48 → 803.26] What does that mean?
[803.68 → 804.46] Love-hugging it?
[804.60 → 804.74] Yeah.
[804.74 → 808.68] Like I bring it up and then everyone like goes to their site just to like to check it out.
[808.82 → 813.20] And it's not used to that kind of traffic because they're this super weird little niche vendor.
[814.12 → 814.88] So anyway, yeah.
[814.88 → 817.58] These are like $360 to $400 cases.
[817.58 → 826.24] And as soon as you start adding some accessories like, you know, a dual power supply mount or like a fancy grill for your radiator or whatever the case may be, they get really expensive.
[826.82 → 831.66] And part of the other problem with them is that because they're highly customizable.
[832.02 → 840.60] So when you click on one of the cases, you'll have all these different options for like different motherboard trays and different drive mounts and all that kind of crazy stuff.
[841.32 → 847.00] It was a really, really challenging line for me to manage.
[847.00 → 853.10] Because unlike a Corsair case where it's like, this is a 580X.
[853.36 → 858.66] It comes with all the things a 580X comes with and is compatible with the things a 580X is compatible with.
[858.66 → 863.68] I had to kind of pre-make the decision for our customers.
[864.42 → 876.92] What colour, what finish of that colour, what mounting options in order to kind of try to have something that is pre-configured in our warehouse that makes sense.
[876.92 → 892.26] And if I made a bad gamble, like if I decided that we wanted UV orange acrylic windows, then if we were stuck with dead stock of that, I had to go rip all those UV orange ones, order some clear ones, put them on myself.
[892.36 → 895.52] Like no one was going to help me with this crap because they all thought it was a total waste of time.
[895.52 → 898.80] Ultimately, carrying Mountain Mods was actually a total waste of time.
[898.90 → 900.36] We didn't end up making a ton of money on it.
[900.50 → 901.66] But, you know, we tried.
[901.82 → 902.54] Sorry, Mountain Mods.
[902.58 → 903.62] And they're cool guys.
[903.72 → 916.88] Like just to be clear, I actually had Mountain Mods, even after we weren't really buying cases from them anymore, I had them powder coat my case for my personal rig because I just absolutely love their powder coat finish.
[916.98 → 918.04] It's just, it's fantastic.
[918.18 → 919.04] Was that available to everybody?
[919.12 → 921.38] You could just send yours in, and they would finish it and send it back?
[921.50 → 922.22] I have no idea.
[922.58 → 923.16] They did it for you.
[923.18 → 923.84] They did it for me though.
[923.84 → 924.46] Nice.
[924.62 → 927.44] Hey, I'm all about, I'm all about working the angles, man.
[927.44 → 927.86] You know that.
[928.36 → 935.00] I was just like, hey, so if I like disassemble, I don't like your cases that much.
[935.28 → 938.72] I like my case, but I really like your paint finish.
[939.32 → 940.34] Can I send it to you?
[940.38 → 941.06] And they did it for me.
[941.08 → 942.40] It looks beautiful to this day.
[942.46 → 947.48] I actually still have that case in Mothballs in case I ever don't have like a rack mounted gaming machine.
[947.56 → 948.50] I'll probably go back to it.
[948.50 → 953.78] Now, can you speak to the other side of this issue in terms of when we see this and like the
[953.84 → 959.32] the spin that all these articles have is that this was a cool freak occurrence where you could get the stuff super cheap,
[959.40 → 964.98] which is amazing for anyone involved who got to be there and got to buy stuff super cheap.
[965.00 → 967.50] And anyone who missed out is super regretful.
[967.50 → 973.02] But no one talks about the perspective of the retailer who's like, man, we just lost a lot of money.
[973.12 → 976.20] This was a $500 case Canadian, our cost.
[976.98 → 981.62] Because the US dollar was actually quite a bit stronger against the Canadian dollar at that point in time.
[981.62 → 987.52] So what happened was I wanted to price it and I think I was even trying to blow them out.
[987.74 → 988.98] Like I was trying to get rid of them.
[989.42 → 994.32] So I had them at I think $499.99 or something like that.
[994.52 → 996.84] So you're just trying to break even and liquidate these things.
[996.84 → 998.44] I'm just trying to flip them.
[998.44 → 1002.76] So I accidentally put a decimal in the wrong place.
[1003.46 → 1004.84] Now, it's funny.
[1004.96 → 1011.16] We actually ended up developing a system later on down the line that would highlight red.
[1011.74 → 1014.18] Highlight yellow and then highlight red.
[1014.50 → 1019.22] Anything that was marked 10 or 20, like some percentage.
[1019.72 → 1023.62] I think it was yellow if it was below cost and then red if it was significantly below our cost.
[1023.62 → 1024.18] It's abnormal.
[1024.32 → 1024.82] It can fly in.
[1024.86 → 1028.70] So that you'll visually see it on your sheet, and you can go to a manual double check.
[1028.78 → 1030.76] But that system didn't exist up until that time.
[1030.98 → 1032.68] They called it the Linus system.
[1032.74 → 1037.70] Yeah, everyone else who had worked there before that just never made boneheaded entry errors.
[1038.36 → 1045.12] But anyway, I accidentally entered 49.999.
[1046.42 → 1049.82] And the system did manage to autocorrect that I had an extra destiny.
[1049.82 → 1052.02] It truncated the extra nine, and then it was $50.
[1052.02 → 1056.24] And it was $50 for a $500 case.
[1056.40 → 1059.02] Now, there were...
[1059.62 → 1067.88] Okay, because it was such a weird niche item, like if we had accidentally priced a hard drive or a CPU or something like that.
[1067.88 → 1069.12] Or a high volume, high demand.
[1069.38 → 1077.70] A high volume item at 10% of the price, we would have noticed immediately because like our servers would have gone down.
[1077.70 → 1078.28] Oh, no.
[1078.32 → 1083.16] You know, we would have had 10,000 people on the site trying to order that frigging thing.
[1083.24 → 1086.46] So you're saying this was a silent killer and no one noticed for weeks.
[1086.80 → 1087.38] No, no.
[1087.66 → 1096.34] We noticed the next day because every order at NCI at that time was actually like the credit card processing was manually reviewed by a team of people.
[1096.34 → 1100.14] So they went through, brought it to the CEO.
[1100.92 → 1105.08] Instead of coming and talking to me about it, thanks, Dr. No.
[1105.22 → 1106.10] You know who you are.
[1107.24 → 1108.76] Brought it straight to the CEO.
[1108.76 → 1110.74] Instead of coming and talking to me about it first.
[1111.40 → 1113.84] And was like, hey, what's up with this?
[1113.84 → 1117.94] We're losing $450 an order on this item.
[1118.16 → 1120.62] Does this seem like sound business to you?
[1121.56 → 1122.30] Oh, man.
[1123.62 → 1128.02] So here's kind of the dark, you know, the other side of this.
[1128.08 → 1131.68] So I get called into the president's office.
[1131.84 → 1134.28] I am a very junior product manager at this point.
[1135.12 → 1140.92] I probably haven't made $5,000 for the company at this point.
[1140.96 → 1142.32] And we've got 10 orders.
[1142.68 → 1143.28] Oh, really?
[1143.28 → 1149.08] Now, it wasn't nearly as bad as it could have been because someone actually had seen it the night before and pulled it out of the sale.
[1149.92 → 1152.64] And I don't even know if we had 10 units in stock.
[1153.70 → 1161.76] But basically, it was $5,000, which to me, to a lot of people, I think is a lot of money.
[1162.14 → 1162.28] Right?
[1162.72 → 1163.86] $5,000, a lot of money.
[1164.06 → 1164.18] Sure.
[1166.08 → 1169.84] And he kind of looks like, sit down.
[1170.26 → 1170.96] He's like, oh, boy.
[1170.96 → 1175.36] And he goes, so here's the situation.
[1175.70 → 1176.90] What are we going to do about this?
[1177.40 → 1180.18] And I was like, why are you asking me?
[1180.60 → 1181.56] I don't know.
[1182.52 → 1184.18] What are we going to do about this?
[1184.18 → 1189.30] And I was like, I'll call them and I'll explain.
[1189.40 → 1189.74] I'm sorry.
[1189.90 → 1190.92] We can't do that.
[1190.98 → 1191.62] Our bad.
[1192.02 → 1193.76] And he's like, no.
[1194.76 → 1195.84] We're going to honour it.
[1196.56 → 1197.96] We're going to eat it this time.
[1197.96 → 1201.36] But that's your training budget for the year.
[1202.46 → 1203.36] Don't do it again.
[1203.96 → 1204.64] And I kind of went.
[1208.42 → 1208.82] So.
[1208.82 → 1212.86] So even if you didn't have 10 in stock, say you had seven in stock.
[1212.94 → 1213.06] Yeah.
[1213.62 → 1215.66] You ordered the other three and fulfilled them?
[1216.08 → 1218.08] Because those could have been easily cancelled.
[1218.26 → 1222.96] If I recall correctly, the ones we didn't have in stock, we cancelled the orders.
[1223.06 → 1225.16] But the ones that we did have in stock, we ate it.
[1225.38 → 1225.58] Yeah.
[1225.58 → 1228.48] So I think we had close to however many we sold.
[1230.78 → 1234.96] And apparently this gear was being sold and shipped by Amazon.
[1235.20 → 1239.62] So I actually would have been Amazon and eating this and an Amazon employee getting the talk
[1239.62 → 1240.34] like that you had.
[1240.34 → 1246.52] So I guess here is, you know, you'll hear a lot of people talk about these kinds of pricing
[1246.52 → 1253.62] errors from a very, I would say, selfish perspective.
[1253.62 → 1256.40] They'll say, well, yeah, maybe you shouldn't have made that mistake then.
[1257.70 → 1261.78] To which I would respond, okay, what's your job?
[1262.10 → 1266.32] Are you a, I don't know, are you a construction worker?
[1266.48 → 1268.00] Are you a drywaller?
[1268.34 → 1269.64] Are you a chef?
[1270.16 → 1272.60] Are you a, you know, whatever, whatever it is.
[1273.26 → 1279.46] If you were to make a mistake that's that easy to make, if you were to put a nail into
[1279.46 → 1283.08] the wrong spot, remember, you are just a cog in the machine.
[1283.08 → 1288.48] I'm not saying that you run the company because in our case, the CEO was in a position to
[1288.48 → 1293.12] make a decision like, let's lose $5,000 today, you know?
[1293.50 → 1296.20] So you're just a cog in the machine.
[1296.54 → 1304.86] If you were to put a nail in the wrong spot, three inches to the right, should you just lose
[1304.86 → 1305.50] $5,000?
[1305.50 → 1312.30] I'm talking about the triviality of the error that was made and the total consequences.
[1313.20 → 1321.32] So, you know, on the one hand, yes, advertising a false price is bad and actually in many cases
[1321.32 → 1321.90] illegal.
[1321.90 → 1331.46] But in this case, I would argue that in some ways the consumer knowing that that price
[1331.46 → 1339.68] is obviously not correct and editorially ordering something is not in the right either.
[1339.82 → 1344.50] Even though their action is completely legal, I would say it is not really ethical.
[1344.50 → 1350.58] Sure, but there's, everyone knows that, you know, everyone throws around this term of
[1350.58 → 1352.48] late stage capitalism.
[1353.14 → 1353.94] Capitalism is great.
[1354.02 → 1358.26] It's the most successful distribution, like wealth distribution system we've ever invented.
[1358.26 → 1364.48] But there are some dark sides of it that result in oligopolies and all sorts of other things
[1364.48 → 1367.28] and silting of wealth and stuff like that.
[1367.34 → 1371.80] And I think because those dark sides of capitalism exist, when things like this happen in favour
[1371.80 → 1375.64] of a consumer, I'm kind of just like, yeah, today it worked for me.
[1377.34 → 1377.56] You know?
[1378.26 → 1379.68] Do two wrongs make a right?
[1379.78 → 1383.08] I mean, that becomes, I think, a bigger debate at a certain point.
[1383.08 → 1392.18] Do you think there's anyone who benefited from this sale who would go, ah, you know what?
[1392.96 → 1393.74] Cancel the order.
[1395.20 → 1397.48] This, I don't deserve this $5,000 camera.
[1397.96 → 1399.96] Well, I think they would say, yeah, go ahead.
[1400.08 → 1400.84] Well, okay.
[1401.04 → 1408.16] I think it takes a particular type of person to go and like, again, you know, when I talk
[1408.16 → 1414.88] about being predatory, I'm not talking about ordering the $500 camera for $100.
[1415.58 → 1418.22] That's maybe believable.
[1418.62 → 1420.66] You know, you might not even look that closely at it.
[1420.70 → 1423.34] You might think it's a B-stock one.
[1423.60 → 1425.44] The $13,000 lens for $94.
[1425.84 → 1426.04] Yeah.
[1426.20 → 1431.50] Or going and ordering, placing six or seven separate orders, trying to get as many of them
[1431.50 → 1432.10] as you can.
[1432.54 → 1439.12] Like, ultimately, that is, it's not stealing because someone is voluntarily giving it to
[1439.12 → 1439.34] you.
[1439.74 → 1441.26] But I'm going to go ahead.
[1441.32 → 1443.14] I'm going to say something super controversial.
[1443.64 → 1448.90] And I'm going to say by the same logic, you know, the settlers here in North America didn't
[1448.90 → 1451.14] steal land from the Native Americans then.
[1451.86 → 1458.34] Because they, in many cases, gave it up voluntarily, not realizing or understanding what the deal they
[1458.34 → 1459.08] were making was.
[1459.08 → 1465.80] Like, I would make the argument that that retailer or that provider of product didn't know that
[1465.80 → 1467.08] that was what was happening.
[1467.26 → 1469.34] And that's clearly predatory.
[1470.24 → 1473.26] Well, it's a little different because this is probably an error.
[1473.52 → 1480.24] But as a parent, if you found out that your kid got, was one such person, they got the $13,000
[1480.24 → 1480.98] lens for $95.
[1480.98 → 1481.80] Oh, I'd make them return it.
[1482.00 → 1484.50] You would make, you would have to talk to you and make them return it.
[1484.62 → 1484.74] Yep.
[1485.44 → 1485.88] Interesting.
[1486.72 → 1487.74] Sucks to be your kids.
[1487.74 → 1493.12] Is there a line where like, okay, if they get the $500 one for $100.
[1493.60 → 1493.86] Yes.
[1494.10 → 1495.14] That's kind of justifiable.
[1495.36 → 1495.48] Yeah.
[1495.52 → 1496.38] To me, it's believable.
[1497.02 → 1500.88] If they get one that's like $2,000 for $100, you're making them return it.
[1501.24 → 1505.42] But if they get something extreme that you're like, okay, don't tell anybody.
[1505.50 → 1506.06] That's crazy.
[1506.28 → 1507.30] You just keep it.
[1507.46 → 1511.36] Like if they find a duffel bag of like a billion dollars, several dollar truck.
[1511.36 → 1514.34] If they find like a duffel bag of money, that's like $3 million in it.
[1514.40 → 1515.78] You're like, okay, just don't tell anybody.
[1515.86 → 1516.54] Let's just move.
[1516.54 → 1519.72] See, that's the thing.
[1520.08 → 1520.40] Okay.
[1521.34 → 1522.50] It's still unethical.
[1523.50 → 1527.94] But if I found a duffel bag of money on the street, I've actually thought about this.
[1528.00 → 1529.54] I have theory crafted this for myself.
[1530.60 → 1534.56] If I found a duffel bag of money on the street, I'm going to use an arbitrary number, but let's
[1534.56 → 1536.40] say it has $5 million in it.
[1536.40 → 1538.12] And I'm talking Canadian rupees.
[1538.34 → 1539.38] So it's not like, you know what?
[1539.44 → 1540.54] No, let's say $5 million.
[1541.38 → 1541.78] Okay.
[1541.84 → 1542.38] $5 million.
[1543.66 → 1544.92] Now my first instance.
[1544.94 → 1545.42] Wait a second.
[1545.78 → 1545.98] Yeah.
[1546.62 → 1551.10] Can be just, then you have to fence US dollars to Canadian and stuff.
[1551.16 → 1552.68] Can we just make it whatever your home currency is?
[1552.82 → 1553.98] You find a bunch of money.
[1554.14 → 1554.70] Okay, fine.
[1554.78 → 1557.86] You find $5 million equivalent in your home currency.
[1557.98 → 1559.56] So for us, that's about $6.5 million.
[1560.36 → 1560.56] Okay.
[1561.14 → 1561.38] We good?
[1561.64 → 1561.82] Sure.
[1561.92 → 1562.12] All right.
[1562.18 → 1562.82] We can go forward now.
[1563.12 → 1563.64] Thank you very much.
[1563.64 → 1566.92] So, okay, I find $5 million in a bag.
[1567.04 → 1569.32] Now my first instinct is actually fear.
[1570.18 → 1570.64] Yeah, sure.
[1571.10 → 1572.14] Why is this here?
[1572.26 → 1573.24] Who's watching it?
[1574.36 → 1578.62] You know, I open it because I'm like, you know, let's say I open it because I'm earnestly
[1578.62 → 1580.36] trying to return it to the owner, right?
[1580.54 → 1583.74] And I open it, and I'm like, holy crap, it's full of money.
[1585.06 → 1587.94] There's no identifying information in it whatsoever, right?
[1588.22 → 1590.72] So you are supposed to turn it into the police.
[1590.80 → 1591.96] That's what you're supposed to do.
[1592.74 → 1593.52] Is that a law?
[1594.00 → 1594.72] I believe so, yes.
[1595.82 → 1603.60] You have to give it to them to give whoever lost it some reasonable amount of time to
[1603.60 → 1604.26] claim it.
[1604.94 → 1608.90] And then after that, I believe theoretically it's supposed to be forfeited back to you.
[1609.00 → 1612.90] But I think in the cases of very valuable or very large sums of cash, that might not
[1612.90 → 1613.86] necessarily be the case.
[1614.50 → 1615.70] And it might just go to the crown.
[1615.70 → 1621.84] Well, you can be relatively sure that it's laundered money or dirty money anyway.
[1621.96 → 1623.42] You can be relatively sure of that, yes.
[1623.62 → 1630.06] So with that in mind, even though it's unethical, I thought about this, actually.
[1630.06 → 1631.46] Like on a plane ride or something?
[1631.46 → 1635.52] I'm pretty sure my course of action, I was like lying awake one night, I couldn't sleep.
[1635.74 → 1638.06] And I was like, I don't remember why I came up, but it doesn't matter.
[1638.14 → 1638.42] It doesn't matter.
[1638.46 → 1640.58] The point is, I'm pretty sure this is what I'd do.
[1640.82 → 1644.62] I would take it home, and I would bury it somewhere.
[1644.62 → 1647.18] I would just bury it.
[1647.84 → 1651.60] And I would wait for some very long period of time.
[1651.92 → 1656.56] If someone came looking for it, I'd want to have it all because I don't know who's showing
[1656.56 → 1657.14] up for it.
[1657.50 → 1662.86] Could be cops, could be drug dealers, could be human traffickers, no idea.
[1663.32 → 1670.52] But whoever they are, I want some kind of credible, plausible deniability story about
[1670.52 → 1675.66] how I was keeping it safe and trying to get in touch with whoever owned it.
[1675.70 → 1676.66] Here you go, go away.
[1676.76 → 1677.84] Please never talk to me again.
[1678.28 → 1680.88] You probably get beat up, but they might not kill me.
[1681.20 → 1681.30] Yeah.
[1681.30 → 1681.52] Okay.
[1681.60 → 1681.84] Okay.
[1682.38 → 1689.44] So after some period of time, let's say 18 months, two years, I'd keep it.
[1690.42 → 1691.10] I'd keep it.
[1691.16 → 1696.90] It would be unethical, and I would know it's unethical, but given who the victim was, we're
[1696.90 → 1699.80] not talking some random blue collar worker who's just trying to do their job.
[1699.80 → 1702.56] We're talking probably drug dealers and human traffickers or whatever.
[1702.76 → 1704.42] We're not having $5 million in a duffel bag.
[1704.60 → 1706.60] There's no legitimate reason for that to exist.
[1707.50 → 1710.58] Given who the victim is, yeah.
[1711.14 → 1711.70] It's good.
[1711.86 → 1712.26] I don't care.
[1712.38 → 1712.96] It's a good plan.
[1713.12 → 1713.70] I like it.
[1714.06 → 1716.14] I don't know that I would go to my house first.
[1717.38 → 1719.12] I might just drive around.
[1719.60 → 1719.96] I don't know.
[1720.08 → 1720.16] Okay.
[1720.36 → 1720.90] You know what?
[1721.12 → 1724.60] Actually, I'm not going to be like, oh, now that you say that, yes, I did think of
[1724.60 → 1724.68] that.
[1724.74 → 1725.52] I actually did.
[1725.66 → 1726.70] I had considered that.
[1726.92 → 1729.56] I would want to make sure I didn't have a tail.
[1730.56 → 1734.60] But I would end up at my house eventually, and I would bury it at my house.
[1734.74 → 1739.48] Would you pick it up right away or would you just go and sit down at a bench within eyeshot?
[1739.72 → 1741.04] Oh, I would pick it up right away.
[1742.00 → 1743.56] I'd pick it up right away for sure.
[1744.02 → 1748.46] But then what I would do is I would pick it up right away, and I would wait nearby with
[1748.46 → 1748.66] it.
[1749.10 → 1753.54] So that way, if someone were to show up, and I'd be like sitting on my phone or something.
[1754.04 → 1757.86] If someone were to show up, I'd be like, oh, yeah, I totally noticed that this was very
[1757.86 → 1758.16] weird.
[1758.16 → 1762.32] And I was looking in the news to see if like who it might go back to.
[1762.56 → 1764.38] And I was about to call the police.
[1764.48 → 1764.96] Here you go.
[1765.38 → 1766.38] We're super cool, right?
[1766.90 → 1767.28] Bye.
[1767.76 → 1773.52] Like I would pretend that I was at least making some kind of effort.
[1773.98 → 1775.44] Just don't kill me.
[1775.50 → 1776.10] Playing dumb.
[1776.22 → 1776.34] Yeah.
[1776.48 → 1777.32] Just don't kill me.
[1777.38 → 1778.58] Playing dumb is not a bad bet.
[1781.66 → 1781.98] Well.
[1781.98 → 1784.42] How did we get on this topic?
[1784.42 → 1787.14] If you got one of those cameras, I say keep it.
[1787.20 → 1788.06] You're a good person.
[1788.58 → 1792.68] I remember when I was in university, when terabyte hard drives were first coming out, there was
[1792.68 → 1793.44] an error like that.
[1793.54 → 1797.56] I forget what company it was, but they were going for like 60 bucks or something like
[1797.56 → 1798.90] that, which was a steal at the time.
[1799.08 → 1801.72] And I regretted not being able to cash in on it.
[1803.32 → 1803.68] Okay.
[1804.20 → 1807.08] But remember too, that's 60 bucks.
[1807.18 → 1807.94] Like it's somewhat credible.
[1807.94 → 1813.58] And besides, there's a difference between ordering one and ordering 20.
[1814.40 → 1815.02] So actually.
[1815.22 → 1815.32] Yeah.
[1815.38 → 1816.16] One's smarter.
[1816.46 → 1820.66] So pricing errors would happen fairly often at NCI.
[1820.76 → 1824.24] And I can tell you right now, if you're the guy that orders one, we were far more likely
[1824.24 → 1824.86] to let it go.
[1825.18 → 1829.90] And if you were the guy that orders 10, we were far more likely to tell you to go cram
[1829.90 → 1830.40] it up your butt.
[1830.76 → 1831.48] You get nothing.
[1833.18 → 1837.76] Because the thing that you got to understand is in any case like this, it's always a judgment
[1837.76 → 1838.10] call.
[1838.34 → 1840.74] And they're going to make a decision case by case basis.
[1841.16 → 1842.78] How much was this our fault?
[1843.22 → 1845.68] How much is our total overall loss?
[1846.36 → 1851.34] How much of a complete a-hole is this particular individual being about it?
[1851.52 → 1855.20] Like if someone came to us and was like threatening to...
[1855.20 → 1856.04] Am I supposed to drink out of this?
[1856.40 → 1857.04] You can if you want.
[1857.12 → 1857.38] It's yours.
[1857.40 → 1857.54] Is it good?
[1857.94 → 1858.74] Well, it's not mine.
[1859.22 → 1860.08] Oh, it's brand new.
[1860.86 → 1861.30] Oh, yeah.
[1861.50 → 1861.72] Right.
[1861.92 → 1862.76] We're launching a new...
[1862.76 → 1863.48] Oh, there's ice in here too.
[1863.48 → 1863.76] Check it out.
[1864.54 → 1865.48] New water bottle.
[1865.68 → 1866.50] There's ice in this.
[1866.58 → 1866.76] Yeah.
[1866.76 → 1867.92] They don't come with ice.
[1868.02 → 1868.86] No, they don't come with ice.
[1868.94 → 1870.52] They don't come with bath water either, thankfully.
[1870.98 → 1874.20] So this is the new limited edition...
[1874.20 → 1874.58] I don't know.
[1874.64 → 1875.32] We might make more of them.
[1875.34 → 1875.72] You never know.
[1875.80 → 1876.88] But we didn't do that many of them.
[1876.96 → 1880.96] But this is the Stealth Linus Tech Tips water bottle.
[1881.22 → 1883.32] So gone is the orange logo.
[1883.84 → 1886.44] In is the matte black logo.
[1886.54 → 1888.54] Well, it's actually kind of a glossy black, but the whole thing's kind of bad.
[1888.54 → 1890.84] Oh, this is the design that I was like, yeah, do this one.
[1890.94 → 1891.20] Yeah.
[1891.50 → 1891.86] Sweet.
[1891.86 → 1893.24] So we decided to do both.
[1893.58 → 1894.04] That's good.
[1894.04 → 1896.20] But we did the orange one first, and then we just had them...
[1896.20 → 1900.28] The orange ones are selling so well that we were like, okay, let's do more orange ones.
[1900.56 → 1902.78] And what the hey, let's do a Stealth one too.
[1902.90 → 1904.48] So LTTstore.com.
[1904.56 → 1906.02] You guys are going to want to check that out.
[1906.06 → 1907.00] It's the same price as the other one.
[1907.00 → 1907.66] I like Stealth.
[1907.98 → 1908.12] Yeah.
[1908.12 → 1908.92] And there's a deal.
[1909.62 → 1910.14] Oh, right.
[1910.30 → 1910.86] And there's a deal.
[1910.86 → 1911.04] A bundle.
[1911.46 → 1912.36] I forgot about that.
[1912.36 → 1912.76] Okay.
[1913.02 → 1915.82] So this week is the Stealth bundle.
[1916.32 → 1918.20] I don't have to actually give them an offer code.
[1918.28 → 1918.64] Do I, Nick?
[1918.64 → 1919.74] It's automatically applied.
[1919.82 → 1920.88] Automatically applied.
[1921.12 → 1924.32] So all you got to do is scroll right past the underwear.
[1925.38 → 1926.00] Or don't.
[1926.08 → 1926.94] And buy that too.
[1926.98 → 1927.86] Yeah, or buy that too.
[1928.94 → 1933.86] And go ahead and add to the cart the Stealth hoodie in your size of choice.
[1933.98 → 1934.56] God damn it.
[1934.56 → 1935.82] How cute is Colton?
[1936.16 → 1936.70] Isn't he?
[1938.10 → 1940.16] The Stealth water bottle.
[1940.66 → 1941.86] Which we'll have pictures later.
[1941.86 → 1943.22] Which we'll have pictures shortly.
[1943.34 → 1944.10] But it looks like this.
[1944.14 → 1944.80] You guys saw it.
[1945.04 → 1947.58] And the LTT hat in black.
[1947.74 → 1948.48] Which I love.
[1948.92 → 1950.98] And Uppity Bop pity.
[1951.58 → 1952.98] Well, that wasn't what I meant to do.
[1953.08 → 1953.36] Boom.
[1953.72 → 1954.68] You get the hat for free.
[1955.16 → 1959.22] So there's no indication that this bundle exists until you make it yourself and your cart.
[1959.24 → 1960.28] You have to be here to know about it.
[1960.30 → 1961.96] You might call it a Stealth bundle.
[1961.96 → 1962.20] Oh.
[1963.28 → 1963.60] Hey.
[1967.18 → 1968.00] That's so sweet.
[1968.04 → 1969.60] But yeah, it's automatically applied to your cart.
[1969.82 → 1970.02] Yep.
[1970.12 → 1971.42] So it'll automatically apply to your cart.
[1971.52 → 1972.52] So guys.
[1972.84 → 1973.88] Oh, what the heck?
[1974.80 → 1975.34] Dang it.
[1975.34 → 1977.90] You guys should try to put other things in your cart and see what happens.
[1978.10 → 1978.42] Oh.
[1979.42 → 1980.20] You never know.
[1980.44 → 1981.74] Merch might just show up at your house.
[1982.78 → 1984.04] My stupid kids.
[1984.36 → 1985.86] They play with my...
[1985.86 → 1988.00] They play with the strings on my hoods.
[1988.84 → 1990.00] They pull them out.
[1991.02 → 1992.08] See, even though it's...
[1992.08 → 1993.02] No, there's a knot in it.
[1993.06 → 1994.34] So it's not going to come out easily.
[1994.46 → 1996.06] But they're always screwing around.
[1996.06 → 1997.62] See, we have preventative measures for this.
[1997.68 → 1997.96] I know.
[1998.16 → 1999.20] We thought of this in the design.
[1999.30 → 1999.82] But they like...
[1999.82 → 2000.88] Your kids foiled you.
[2000.90 → 2001.68] Work hard at it.
[2001.80 → 2002.74] I don't have a red hat.
[2002.80 → 2003.66] I only have the black ones.
[2003.72 → 2004.40] This is pretty nice.
[2004.50 → 2004.68] Forget it.
[2005.24 → 2005.56] Anyway.
[2006.14 → 2006.64] So yeah.
[2006.74 → 2008.40] It's the hoodie that I'm wearing right now.
[2009.32 → 2012.32] Which can be configured with the strings even.
[2012.52 → 2014.32] But, you know, your mileage may vary on that.
[2014.78 → 2017.62] So this one with the phone pocket and the...
[2017.62 → 2018.50] Does it have a water bottle pocket?
[2018.70 → 2019.72] Does not have a water bottle.
[2019.72 → 2020.74] Where the heck's my phone?
[2021.36 → 2022.22] I don't know where my phone is.
[2022.30 → 2023.06] I mean, yeah, you could put a water bottle.
[2023.06 → 2024.30] It does have a water bottle pocket.
[2024.40 → 2024.54] Yeah.
[2024.58 → 2025.62] So it's got the phone pocket.
[2025.70 → 2027.28] I wouldn't actually recommend putting a water bottle.
[2027.42 → 2028.10] That'll stretch it.
[2028.10 → 2030.12] But this is my hoodie.
[2030.22 → 2031.16] Don't screw with my hoodie.
[2031.26 → 2032.42] So it's this one.
[2033.52 → 2035.08] It's the black on black hat.
[2035.46 → 2037.96] And it's the black on black water bottle.
[2038.14 → 2040.98] Add all those to your cart, and you will get $20 off.
[2041.06 → 2043.38] Which is basically the price of the hat.
[2043.92 → 2046.26] And so it's kind of like getting a free hat.
[2046.58 → 2050.10] It's so unusual that I love this hat.
[2050.36 → 2053.88] Because usually when I try on a hat, for some reason, I don't know if it's my head shape or whatever.
[2053.98 → 2056.02] But I get these weird creases like right here and here.
[2056.24 → 2056.36] Yeah.
[2056.36 → 2058.58] These, they're just perfect.
[2059.48 → 2060.90] Great for covering up your greasy hair.
[2061.64 → 2063.40] Which is most of the week.
[2063.40 → 2064.04] My hair is actually not that bad today.
[2064.12 → 2064.90] Most of the week for me.
[2064.98 → 2066.46] I'm going with my hair today.
[2066.58 → 2068.22] I'm not much of a hat guy every day.
[2068.58 → 2071.36] But I burn in about eight minutes outside.
[2072.36 → 2073.62] So I actually do wear it.
[2073.62 → 2078.22] When I wear that hat and a hoodie, my wife says that I look like I'm from Abbotsford.
[2078.90 → 2079.84] From Abbotsford.
[2080.02 → 2081.16] What does that even mean?
[2081.46 → 2082.78] As opposed to Vancouver, I guess.
[2084.48 → 2085.14] I don't know.
[2085.30 → 2086.18] Um, Neuralink.
[2086.18 → 2087.88] What's this other shirt you have on?
[2088.40 → 2089.04] Oh, right.
[2089.12 → 2089.52] LTD.
[2089.52 → 2089.80] Okay.
[2089.84 → 2090.48] Are we doing sponsor?
[2090.56 → 2091.12] Let's do sponsor.
[2091.18 → 2091.48] You know what?
[2091.54 → 2092.00] I thought we were.
[2092.00 → 2092.64] Let's do sponsors now.
[2093.32 → 2095.00] LTX 2019, baby.
[2095.62 → 2097.08] It's going to be flipping sick.
[2097.30 → 2098.50] This is my staff shirt.
[2099.40 → 2099.76] Woo.
[2100.24 → 2101.08] I got staff.
[2101.16 → 2101.88] Really excited.
[2102.02 → 2105.00] I mean, look, if we're pimping everything, I might as well just be like, yeah.
[2105.06 → 2105.48] Oh, my God.
[2105.66 → 2107.30] We've got the underwear now, too.
[2107.48 → 2107.92] Yeah.
[2109.00 → 2112.38] I actually got our first customer feedback on the underwear already.
[2112.52 → 2112.80] Oh, yeah?
[2112.90 → 2113.08] Yeah.
[2113.12 → 2115.52] Someone tagged me in a status update on the forum.
[2115.64 → 2116.42] Crotch is too tight.
[2116.74 → 2119.58] And, uh, yeah, sure.
[2120.14 → 2121.18] Yeah, sure, James.
[2121.88 → 2123.82] Um, yeah, they messaged me on the forum.
[2123.92 → 2126.26] They were like, wow, I can't believe I got it so fast.
[2126.56 → 2127.08] Oh, that's great.
[2127.10 → 2128.22] Because we launched it a couple of days ago.
[2128.28 → 2128.96] They got it yesterday.
[2129.54 → 2131.58] So they got it basically immediately.
[2132.12 → 2132.84] Where were they located?
[2133.14 → 2135.06] They were like, yeah, I'm actually not sure.
[2135.42 → 2137.10] And I couldn't share that information anyway.
[2137.28 → 2140.40] But, um, I guess I could if it was vague enough.
[2140.56 → 2141.16] Yeah, I don't know.
[2141.24 → 2141.66] I don't know where they're located.
[2141.66 → 2143.10] Like in Canada, in the U.S.?
[2143.10 → 2143.54] No idea.
[2143.78 → 2144.84] But they got it already.
[2145.02 → 2146.18] And they're ordering two more.
[2146.60 → 2147.02] Two more packs.
[2147.02 → 2147.28] Really?
[2147.42 → 2148.96] They're like, yeah, I love it.
[2149.04 → 2149.92] That's saying a lot.
[2150.08 → 2154.36] Having nine pairs of underwear, that's, like, probably going to be half of this person's
[2154.36 → 2155.38] whole repertoire of underwear.
[2155.38 → 2157.48] Yeah, I mean, if they do weekly laundry, maybe their whole one.
[2158.98 → 2161.72] And, yeah, they were just like, yeah, I ordered one as a test.
[2161.88 → 2163.26] And I'm ordering two more.
[2163.48 → 2164.40] They're freaking awesome.
[2164.52 → 2164.84] Love them.
[2164.94 → 2170.12] And that's saying a lot, especially when you consider that they're $50 U.S. for three
[2170.12 → 2170.48] packs.
[2170.86 → 2172.04] Or, excuse me, for three pairs.
[2172.34 → 2173.82] That's not exorbitant.
[2174.62 → 2176.18] It depends on what you're used to.
[2176.18 → 2177.82] There are a lot.
[2178.06 → 2184.00] Speaking of Canadian dollars, which I feel like buying power-wise is probably the same.
[2184.26 → 2187.68] Like, if you're in the U.S. and you buy $20 underwear, it probably hurts you the same
[2187.68 → 2189.88] as $20 underwear in Canada.
[2189.96 → 2190.08] Yeah.
[2190.08 → 2198.10] If you find good underwear that's $22, that's, like, a good deal.
[2198.30 → 2201.34] Because there are a lot of boxers that think they should be worth $35.
[2201.86 → 2203.36] It depends on what you're used to.
[2203.42 → 2205.40] Because if you're, like, a Lululemon shopper.
[2206.10 → 2206.48] Oh, yeah.
[2206.52 → 2207.08] My whole drawer.
[2207.22 → 2207.66] Then.
[2207.80 → 2208.66] Before the line of.
[2208.70 → 2208.84] Yeah.
[2208.96 → 2211.38] $22 underwear probably doesn't shock you.
[2211.88 → 2212.02] Whereas.
[2212.24 → 2214.10] Because Lululemon ones are $22 or $25.
[2214.10 → 2215.40] That's why they're so wicked.
[2216.68 → 2217.22] And then.
[2217.44 → 2217.66] But.
[2217.86 → 2219.24] If you're a Hands shopper.
[2219.36 → 2219.54] Yeah.
[2219.74 → 2224.80] And you buy, you know, a 30-pack of underwear for $10 at, like, you know, Costco or whatever.
[2225.22 → 2225.50] Look.
[2226.04 → 2227.58] Even the cheap rounds are more.
[2227.68 → 2228.10] I'm exaggerating.
[2228.66 → 2228.82] Yeah.
[2228.84 → 2229.36] I'm exaggerating.
[2229.40 → 2229.96] I'm just saying.
[2230.02 → 2236.28] If you buy, like, you know, an Acme, you know, palette of underwear.
[2236.30 → 2237.08] What are they actually?
[2237.14 → 2238.04] They're, like, $6 a pair?
[2238.40 → 2240.04] I have no idea.
[2240.04 → 2245.84] The last time I bought underwear was my wife buys my underwear.
[2245.98 → 2247.46] I don't know how much underwear costs.
[2248.14 → 2252.16] All I know is what I did in terms of, like, price comparison for these.
[2252.72 → 2258.50] And the material quality is more comparable to your $25 to $35 per pair underwear.
[2259.06 → 2265.54] And our pricing is more like $15, yeah, $16 a pair.
[2265.64 → 2266.82] $16.50 a pair.
[2266.82 → 2271.80] So, I feel like, yes, they're expensive, but also they're not unreasonable.
[2272.12 → 2276.18] And part of it is just the brand that we're trying to build for the merch is, like, look,
[2276.24 → 2281.70] it's unapologetically not cheap, but it's also not basic.
[2281.88 → 2282.42] Like, it's nice.
[2282.48 → 2282.98] You'll like it.
[2284.04 → 2284.66] I'm trying it.
[2284.66 → 2285.68] How much does underwear cost?
[2285.68 → 2285.82] I'm trying it.
[2285.82 → 2285.90] I'm trying it.
[2285.90 → 2287.40] Underwear on Costco.com.
[2287.46 → 2289.20] And the first thing that comes up is depends.
[2289.54 → 2291.78] Your screen's not sharing with me for some reason.
[2292.14 → 2292.48] Oh, wait.
[2292.54 → 2295.36] You're using your laptop instead of the second stream laptop.
[2295.38 → 2298.76] I didn't even know that that laptop, that the second stream laptop can share.
[2299.04 → 2299.78] Oh, yeah, it can.
[2300.36 → 2300.86] Okay, here we go.
[2300.96 → 2305.38] $15 for Champion Men's Boxer Briefs five packs.
[2305.52 → 2305.76] Okay.
[2305.76 → 2307.30] So, that's $3 a pair.
[2307.38 → 2308.12] So, that's really cheap.
[2308.16 → 2308.62] That's cheap.
[2308.62 → 2312.66] We are literally five to six times the price of that.
[2313.36 → 2316.22] Wow, that train is really loud when the bays open, isn't it?
[2316.96 → 2318.88] That is fantastic.
[2319.50 → 2324.90] That's your underwear rolling out to a mailbox near you.
[2326.04 → 2327.54] Do people like the underwear colours?
[2327.66 → 2329.74] Are there any colours that people would like to see?
[2329.86 → 2330.42] Do we know that yet?
[2330.56 → 2331.40] I have no idea.
[2331.40 → 2331.72] Hit us up in the chat.
[2331.92 → 2333.48] Yeah, we're waiting to hear back from people.
[2333.92 → 2335.14] People are complaining about the leg.
[2335.22 → 2337.54] Guys, we got nothing to do to help you.
[2337.54 → 2339.36] Twitch.tv slash Linus Tech.
[2339.52 → 2340.76] Our stream is fine.
[2341.22 → 2343.24] YouTube is dropping all the frames.
[2343.66 → 2345.76] We don't know what to tell you guys.
[2345.90 → 2348.02] We've got to make some pink underwear at some point.
[2348.08 → 2350.24] We should use holiday underwear, Christmas pattern.
[2350.32 → 2350.94] That would be awesome.
[2351.04 → 2353.78] The minimum order quantities for underwear are really high.
[2354.36 → 2354.64] Really?
[2354.78 → 2355.06] Yeah.
[2355.26 → 2362.72] So, doing just like a bunch of different patterns and stuff is maybe not on the roadmap
[2362.72 → 2363.78] anytime soon.
[2363.90 → 2365.02] We've got to do Christmas.
[2365.46 → 2366.28] We'll see how it goes.
[2366.32 → 2367.12] We'll see how it goes.
[2367.12 → 2370.98] The nice thing about Christmas undies is if you have leftover product, just put it in
[2370.98 → 2372.58] the attic for a year and bring it out next year.
[2373.18 → 2374.76] So, guys, a few more things.
[2376.58 → 2376.94] LTD.
[2377.16 → 2379.20] It is next Saturday and Sunday.
[2379.42 → 2380.98] Not this, like tomorrow Saturday.
[2381.36 → 2382.46] Next Saturday and Sunday.
[2382.72 → 2385.08] There's going to be 3,000 plus people a day.
[2385.28 → 2386.26] It's going to be freaking awesome.
[2386.48 → 2387.02] It's going to be insane.
[2387.10 → 2389.46] It's going to be almost 600 people at the BYOC LAN.
[2389.54 → 2391.04] We've got tons of stuff to do.
[2391.10 → 2394.84] I'm going to bring up the map for anyone who's not sure if they should attend or not.
[2394.84 → 2395.56] There's so many YouTubers.
[2395.82 → 2396.28] Here it is.
[2396.66 → 2400.46] There are so many creators there.
[2400.56 → 2400.80] How many?

[2403.74 → 2404.34] There's a lot.
[2404.40 → 2405.62] I'm in charge of the main stage.
[2405.72 → 2408.30] We've got panels going all day with all sorts of different creators.
[2408.68 → 2409.22] Some you know.
[2409.52 → 2410.40] Some you may not know.
[2410.68 → 2411.48] And you want to know.
[2411.48 → 2412.60] Attendee info.

[2441.88 → 2443.46] I think that's actually exactly 25.
[2444.08 → 2444.34] Nice.
[2444.84 → 2447.12] We went all freaking out.
[2447.46 → 2454.04] So, if you want to meet any of those people, or like realistically, most of them, come to
[2454.04 → 2454.36] LEX.
[2454.44 → 2456.32] And not even meet, but like hang out.
[2456.78 → 2456.96] Yep.
[2457.08 → 2457.70] It's two days.
[2457.76 → 2460.20] You could probably talk to each of those people for a solid 10 minutes.
[2460.62 → 2463.24] Well, I don't want to make commitments on that to have.
[2463.26 → 2463.40] Okay.
[2463.44 → 2465.64] I'm thinking about past LTX.
[2465.64 → 2467.58] Yeah, you can talk to James for 10 minutes if you want.
[2467.78 → 2468.82] I'm busy, man.
[2469.78 → 2471.88] You can come to the main stage area and heckle me.
[2472.82 → 2473.70] I'll yell at you.
[2473.88 → 2474.26] Yeah, no.
[2474.34 → 2475.64] It's going to be great, guys.
[2475.92 → 2476.78] It's going to be a blast.
[2476.88 → 2478.06] There are still some tickets available.
[2478.82 → 2479.72] Not many.
[2480.86 → 2481.80] Get out here, though.
[2481.98 → 2482.22] Yeah.
[2482.40 → 2483.66] You can Airbnb at my place.
[2483.66 → 2486.04] We'll have LTT store merch for sale.

[2497.34 → 2498.78] booth, that'll be sick.
[2498.78 → 2500.32] VRRC cars is going to be sick.
[2500.42 → 2501.82] Jake's got four cars up and running.
[2502.38 → 2507.58] And instead of doing a race, we're actually doing more like a first-person treasure hunt.
[2508.32 → 2510.20] So, you have to go around and search for clues.
[2510.42 → 2512.24] Is that even known?
[2512.78 → 2513.88] I don't think so.
[2514.34 → 2514.80] Quiet.
[2515.44 → 2515.72] Oh.
[2517.16 → 2517.60] Shh.
[2521.20 → 2523.78] Also, the main stage schedule will be here soon.
[2524.94 → 2526.18] And so, we'll be sharing that.
[2526.26 → 2527.68] We're going to play Family Feud.
[2528.52 → 2529.60] Yeah, that'll be fun.
[2529.64 → 2531.48] It's going to be so sweet.
[2531.86 → 2532.10] Wait.
[2532.24 → 2533.30] Am I allowed to show this?
[2533.42 → 2533.74] Oh, yeah.
[2533.78 → 2534.56] I can just show this.
[2534.88 → 2535.22] Cool.
[2535.46 → 2536.10] There you go, guys.
[2536.68 → 2538.34] So, we're going to have a bunch of panels.
[2538.50 → 2540.12] PC dos and don'ts with hardware connects.
[2540.22 → 2540.86] Level 1 text.
[2540.98 → 2541.34] And Jake.
[2541.34 → 2544.54] What the hell is going on?
[2544.72 → 2544.96] What?
[2547.90 → 2549.38] This better be a new merch item.
[2550.66 → 2551.50] It's not going to work.
[2553.06 → 2555.12] Oh, he just nailed the shelf.
[2556.10 → 2557.32] Can I help you guys?
[2557.48 → 2560.80] Is this to do with LTX?
[2560.82 → 2561.48] No, no, no.
[2561.52 → 2561.98] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2562.10 → 2563.18] Yeah, just come over here.
[2563.26 → 2567.56] Yeah, I mean, you can't have us react to this and not show people what's going on.
[2567.58 → 2567.90] It's B-roll.
[2568.00 → 2569.30] This is Linus Media Group.
[2569.42 → 2569.92] Bunny Roll.
[2570.46 → 2570.72] Yeah.
[2570.72 → 2571.82] Bunny Roll, indeed.
[2571.96 → 2572.52] Yeah, it's Bunny Roll.
[2572.94 → 2574.16] Show him your tails.
[2575.08 → 2577.12] No, this isn't that kind of program.
[2577.50 → 2578.74] Yeah, well, Nick makes it is.
[2578.74 → 2578.88] Nick is cute.
[2580.34 → 2582.62] David's over there wearing nothing but a trench coat.
[2582.66 → 2583.16] I got to go.
[2583.22 → 2585.34] He's wearing a gabardine.
[2585.50 → 2587.12] A flasher coat.
[2587.80 → 2588.28] Exhibitionist costume.
[2588.28 → 2588.78] I don't know.
[2588.78 → 2590.08] I don't know what these guys are doing.
[2590.22 → 2591.30] Colton doesn't even have a tail.
[2591.82 → 2592.34] That's weak.
[2592.34 → 2595.48] You don't sound stoked for Family Feud.
[2596.20 → 2597.42] That's going to be so sweet.
[2597.50 → 2599.84] I have never watched Family Feud and I don't quite know what it is.
[2599.98 → 2600.22] Okay.
[2600.80 → 2602.36] It's the survey says.
[2603.44 → 2603.76] Sure.
[2603.92 → 2604.52] We did a survey.
[2604.98 → 2605.20] Yeah.
[2605.20 → 2612.04] So we're going to have the best processor to pick in 2019 with Austin Evans, Jay's Two Cent,
[2612.16 → 2613.42] and our very own Anthony.
[2613.96 → 2616.56] We're going to have running a YouTube business, the early years.
[2616.66 → 2617.26] I'll be up there.
[2617.34 → 2617.96] Strange Parts.
[2618.02 → 2618.80] EPOS Vox.
[2619.64 → 2620.56] Q&A with LMG.
[2620.64 → 2621.34] Part 1 Creative.
[2621.34 → 2622.24] Part 2 Business.
[2622.36 → 2623.76] We'll have different members of our team chatting.
[2623.86 → 2628.46] We're going to do PC versus Mac with Luke, Snazzy Labs, and Gamers Nexus.
[2628.66 → 2629.26] That'll be fun.
[2629.68 → 2633.74] Budget versus Performance with Linus Tech Tips, Tech Deals, and Pedro from PCMR.
[2633.94 → 2635.38] It's going to be freaking awesome, guys.
[2635.48 → 2637.80] Don't miss it if you don't absolutely have to.
[2638.18 → 2643.48] You can catch the panels, by the way, if you just tune in on Float plane.
[2643.68 → 2645.62] So we're going to have those available on Float plane.
[2647.54 → 2651.28] Also, Float plane pricing for Linus Tech Tips will be going up soon.
[2651.54 → 2653.60] We finally got our pricing tiers figured out.
[2653.72 → 2654.82] So it's going to go up to $5.
[2655.60 → 2658.76] However, we are going to grandfather or grandmother.
[2659.30 → 2659.66] Equal.
[2659.70 → 2660.22] Grand person.
[2660.56 → 2660.92] Grand person.
[2661.04 → 2664.82] We're going to grand person in anyone who is already subscribed.
[2665.14 → 2667.12] So you're going to want to get over there pretty quick.
[2667.80 → 2668.62] Should I subscribe now?
[2668.68 → 2669.48] We've got a number.
[2669.60 → 2670.36] Is it free forever for me?
[2670.72 → 2671.62] I don't even have an account.
[2672.44 → 2675.30] I don't know how staff accounts work, to be honest with you.
[2676.64 → 2677.04] Yeah.
[2677.30 → 2678.06] Can we do?
[2678.50 → 2678.80] Oh, yeah.
[2678.84 → 2679.68] Actual sponsor stuff.
[2679.70 → 2679.96] Yeah.
[2679.96 → 2680.90] Actual sponsor stuff.
[2680.90 → 2681.52] Holy cow.
[2681.68 → 2682.50] New sponsor.
[2682.80 → 2683.20] Bench.
[2683.36 → 2684.04] Not that Bench.
[2684.10 → 2684.54] Different Bench.
[2684.56 → 2685.52] What Bench are you talking about?
[2685.76 → 2687.70] Like the apparel brand.
[2687.88 → 2688.94] Like Bench.
[2689.00 → 2689.94] Yeah, like that Bench.
[2689.98 → 2690.52] It's not Bench.
[2690.56 → 2690.78] No.
[2691.06 → 2691.34] No, no.
[2692.40 → 2695.86] Bench allows you to run your business and let Bench do your bookkeeping.
[2696.00 → 2699.38] They're the largest North American online bookkeeping service, and they're partnered with
[2699.38 → 2700.86] a dedicated team of bookkeepers.
[2701.18 → 2704.86] You can automatically import your transactions from your bank and merchant processors.
[2704.86 → 2707.82] They'll do accurate end-of-month financial statements for your business.
[2708.24 → 2712.50] You can track your financials through the Bench app available on your iPhone or web browser,
[2712.72 → 2715.10] and they've got unlimited support at any time.
[2715.34 → 2718.68] Visual reports allow you to quickly see how your business is performing, and at the end
[2718.68 → 2722.68] of the year, you'll get a financial package that allows you to easily complete your taxes
[2722.68 → 2723.26] accurately.
[2723.26 → 2727.12] The bottom line is when small business owners outsource their bookkeeping to Bench, they
[2727.12 → 2728.90] get more time to focus on running their business.
[2729.26 → 2733.88] So check them out at leg.GG slash Bench, and you can get 20% off your first six months
[2733.88 → 2734.84] of bookkeeping.

[2779.70 → 2780.84] There's another Nintendo Switch.
[2780.84 → 2784.40] There's another Nintendo Switch, but also there isn't.
[2784.56 → 2787.62] It's the same Nintendo Switch, but different.
[2787.62 → 2789.84] If you buy a Nintendo Switch now...
[2790.64 → 2790.98] Yes.
[2791.80 → 2792.42] Hold on.
[2792.46 → 2792.88] Is it now?
[2793.10 → 2794.22] No, it's in mid-August.
[2794.30 → 2794.80] Mid-August.
[2794.86 → 2796.68] If in mid-August you buy a Nintendo Switch...
[2796.68 → 2796.74] Yes.
[2797.30 → 2801.96] ...and a past version of you in the present now buys a Nintendo Switch, you will have
[2801.96 → 2803.40] bought two different Nintendo Switches.
[2803.40 → 2804.92] Yes.
[2805.28 → 2810.44] Unless you get old stock, and the future you get old stock, and then that's a bummer.
[2810.56 → 2812.56] So you're in mid-August buying a Nintendo Switch.
[2812.68 → 2815.74] That Switch happens to have been on the shelf since at least today.
[2815.92 → 2816.16] Yes.
[2816.62 → 2819.82] That sucks, because the new ones are going to have improved battery life.
[2819.88 → 2820.96] Pretty significantly improved.
[2820.96 → 2826.48] The current ones that are on shelves right now, they claim battery life of two and a half
[2826.48 → 2830.24] to six and a half hours, which is a big range, but...
[2830.24 → 2833.02] It goes from pretty decent to like...
[2833.02 → 2837.08] Depending on the game and how hot it is and all sorts of stuff.
[2837.44 → 2841.02] The new ones are going to have 4.5 to 9 hours.
[2841.68 → 2844.92] So that's like on the low end of the new Switches.
[2845.28 → 2851.80] The lowest end, according to this claim, is like in the 66th percentile of the old ones.
[2851.98 → 2852.70] That's pretty good.
[2853.00 → 2854.32] And you're not going to pay anything more for that.
[2854.40 → 2855.98] That's just going to be the new standard Switch.
[2855.98 → 2863.82] So the word on the street, if you hang out on sites that really follow like Silicon news
[2863.82 → 2868.58] closely, is that this is because they had to do a...
[2868.58 → 2872.72] Like basically they were just doing a new spin because they needed to move to a new process
[2872.72 → 2875.50] or they needed it for the Switch Lite or something like that.
[2875.74 → 2881.42] Like and since they were doing it anyway, they might as well just put it in the full size
[2881.42 → 2884.94] Switch, and then they can have better battery life.
[2884.94 → 2889.78] Like basically it's a power consumption decreasing move that they've done here.
[2889.86 → 2890.90] It's not a different battery.
[2891.08 → 2892.38] Yeah, it's not a different battery.
[2892.62 → 2895.92] They have altered the power consumption of the processor in the Nintendo Switch.
[2896.04 → 2897.74] So they figured, oh, what the hey, we're doing it anyway.
[2897.84 → 2899.08] We might as well put it in the Switch.
[2899.82 → 2902.22] The product model number doesn't even change.
[2903.30 → 2905.92] This will have better battery life even than the Switch Lite.
[2906.36 → 2906.60] Yeah.
[2906.78 → 2908.40] Which has better battery life than the old one.
[2908.48 → 2910.20] Well, I would think then just for the...
[2910.20 → 2911.22] Because the Switch Lite is small.
[2911.22 → 2915.60] So I would think for the full size Switch, they're just putting the same battery as the original one
[2915.60 → 2917.32] and it just happens to be a bigger one than the Lite.
[2917.56 → 2917.72] Yeah.
[2917.80 → 2922.08] But they would have needed this more power efficient chip in order to make the Switch Lite
[2922.08 → 2926.06] have a reasonable battery life at all while also being quite a bit smaller.
[2926.54 → 2926.86] Right.
[2927.74 → 2932.90] The rumour at this point is that an enhanced version of the Switch targeted at avid gamers
[2932.90 → 2934.06] is also in production.
[2934.06 → 2937.40] But Nintendo has not indicated that this is the case yet.
[2937.40 → 2944.10] With that said, based on this new manufacturing process, if they were to produce a more powerful
[2944.10 → 2950.82] chip and target 2.5 to 6.5 hours of gameplay like the original Switch, maybe they could do
[2950.82 → 2952.30] a Switch Pro or a Switch...
[2952.30 → 2953.18] What do you think they would call it?
[2953.84 → 2954.30] Wow.
[2954.36 → 2959.34] Are there other Nintendo consoles that have had iterations like that?
[2959.36 → 2960.12] Like Pro monikers?
[2961.14 → 2962.94] Have they ever done like a DS Pro?
[2962.94 → 2967.18] Well, they did lots of different versions...
[2967.18 → 2969.92] Advanced with Game Boy and SP.
[2972.28 → 2974.94] But what about on actual consoles like a 64...
[2976.04 → 2977.02] Yeah.
[2977.38 → 2979.20] I mean, they did like a Super Nintendo.
[2979.54 → 2980.60] That was a long time ago though.
[2980.66 → 2981.24] Super Switch?
[2981.40 → 2981.98] I doubt it.
[2981.98 → 2983.44] Super Nintendo wasn't just an iteration.
[2983.58 → 2984.64] That was a whole new release.
[2984.64 → 2985.02] Yeah.
[2985.02 → 2990.66] But Nintendo's naming for things is so weird because like one time that they have maintained
[2990.66 → 2994.90] interconsole compatibility was with the Wii and the Wii U.
[2995.44 → 2995.72] So what?
[2995.78 → 2996.32] Switch U?
[2997.00 → 2998.30] But that was a complete failure.
[2998.40 → 2999.14] They'll never do that.
[3000.08 → 3001.46] We don't say that anymore.
[3002.92 → 3006.70] You know if it was anyone else, you know, I'd be like Switch GT.
[3006.98 → 3009.80] Like that would be a more conventional North American thing to do.
[3009.80 → 3012.30] Or like a Switch XT.
[3012.52 → 3014.02] You know, like put a suffix on it.
[3014.20 → 3014.70] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3015.48 → 3017.32] But I can't see Nintendo doing that.
[3017.96 → 3018.94] That's just not really...
[3018.94 → 3020.02] They should just put another S.
[3020.26 → 3020.90] The Switch.
[3021.00 → 3021.62] The double S.
[3022.62 → 3022.82] S.
[3022.98 → 3023.26] Okay.
[3023.40 → 3024.84] I wouldn't put anything past them.
[3025.22 → 3032.32] They named a console where you grab a thing like this and wave it around the Wii.
[3032.96 → 3034.26] Like I...
[3034.26 → 3034.80] It's...
[3034.80 → 3037.52] I've never heard anyone make that association.
[3039.14 → 3039.70] Really?
[3040.72 → 3041.16] Yeah.
[3041.54 → 3045.78] You've never heard anyone make the association between the Wii and a penis?
[3046.64 → 3048.84] And saying Wii like together?
[3050.16 → 3050.56] What?
[3051.02 → 3051.78] No, I've never heard that.
[3052.28 → 3052.84] No, no, no.
[3052.86 → 3054.34] Not doing it together.
[3054.48 → 3055.52] No, but you're saying...
[3055.52 → 3056.30] I thought you meant Wii.
[3056.42 → 3057.08] Oh, Wii.
[3057.22 → 3058.14] Like W-E-E.
[3058.80 → 3059.20] Yeah.
[3059.40 → 3060.04] Oh, no.
[3060.08 → 3060.76] I haven't heard that either.
[3062.16 → 3062.84] Shut up.
[3062.96 → 3063.56] Yes, you have.
[3063.56 → 3063.90] I'm not joking.
[3063.90 → 3065.86] I don't even believe you're right now.
[3066.00 → 3067.00] Man, I'm younger than you.
[3067.06 → 3067.50] That's nuts.
[3067.50 → 3069.06] I was like 14 when that came out.
[3069.56 → 3072.66] And at 14, you weren't making pee and wiener jokes.
[3072.68 → 3073.00] No.
[3073.44 → 3074.56] No, you were above that.
[3075.18 → 3076.52] You heard it here first, guys.
[3077.08 → 3081.42] James has matured as a human being in a very unusual fashion.
[3081.54 → 3082.00] Do you see this?
[3082.18 → 3083.36] Do you see this?
[3083.38 → 3087.22] He started out with a very highbrow sense of humour.
[3087.42 → 3089.20] And then he's degraded from there.
[3089.28 → 3090.00] I'm no loud children.
[3090.12 → 3090.90] I only have the shirt.
[3090.90 → 3098.68] Do you think as a company, like, does Nintendo have to get these old soon-to-be inferior switches
[3098.68 → 3101.44] off the shelves before they can...
[3101.44 → 3106.06] Like, if you buy one before the new one comes out, is there a period of time when you can
[3106.06 → 3106.76] exchange it?
[3106.94 → 3108.12] Like honouring the sale price?
[3108.12 → 3110.56] So I think the store is just going to end up eating it.
[3110.72 → 3112.56] And they might send it back to Nintendo.
[3112.82 → 3119.06] And Nintendo might have some kind of B-stock way to dump old inventory out.
[3119.20 → 3120.36] Like, I'm sure this...
[3120.36 → 3125.36] I mean, if there's anything they learned from the Wii U, it don't call something
[3125.36 → 3127.62] you and how to get rid of dead stock.
[3127.90 → 3129.74] So I'm sure they can figure it out.
[3129.74 → 3134.88] But yeah, if I was a retailer and I ended up taking back a bunch of crappy battery life
[3134.88 → 3138.56] switches, I would probably just send them back to Nintendo and be like, look, this is
[3138.56 → 3138.94] your problem.
[3139.02 → 3141.34] If you want me to keep carrying your product, I'm not eating these.
[3142.82 → 3143.28] All right.
[3143.66 → 3145.90] Neuralink applies to the FDA for human trials.
[3145.90 → 3150.22] So Neuralink, a company set up by Elon Musk to explore ways to connect the human brain
[3150.22 → 3154.68] to a computer interface, has applied to U.S. regulators to start trialling its device
[3154.68 → 3156.12] on humans.
[3156.32 → 3156.48] Okay.
[3156.54 → 3158.06] That sounds really clickbaity.
[3158.06 → 3160.12] So Neuralink is a...
[3160.12 → 3160.92] You wrote it!
[3161.26 → 3162.10] I copy-pasted it.
[3162.56 → 3168.80] It's a brain-machine interface company with the ultimate eventual goal of making an interface
[3168.80 → 3174.10] that you can connect non-intrusively to the brain so we can, you know, have hard drives
[3174.10 → 3178.54] for memory and basically keep up with the machines.
[3178.54 → 3178.60] Hopefully not hard drives.
[3179.18 → 3179.62] Yes.
[3180.36 → 3181.36] Just...
[3181.36 → 3184.62] Keep up with the AI that's going to make us their pets.
[3185.32 → 3186.52] So be a cyborg.
[3186.52 → 3186.58] Sure.
[3186.80 → 3191.74] But in Elon Musk fashion, he usually shoots for the moon but makes a monetizable path
[3191.74 → 3192.88] to get there, right?
[3192.88 → 3194.80] So if he wants to go to Mars, he starts doing...
[3195.80 → 3199.52] He makes his own space shuttle and then brings people just to the ISS and makes money doing
[3199.52 → 3203.24] that so he can finance the eventual trip to Mars and research all the technology along
[3203.24 → 3203.46] the way.
[3203.68 → 3205.46] So what they're doing with Neuralink is the same thing.
[3206.04 → 3207.02] They're...
[3207.02 → 3210.14] Apparently, according to their claims, they've already surpassed the state of the art and
[3210.14 → 3214.86] they're trying to make these brain-machine interfaces that can help people like with Parkinson's
[3214.86 → 3219.56] and other neurological diseases just not have seizures anymore and stuff like that.
[3219.92 → 3225.02] And then once they continue to do that, eventually the technology will be good enough that you
[3225.02 → 3226.94] and I don't need to use a keyboard and mouse anymore.
[3226.94 → 3227.04] Sorry.
[3227.04 → 3233.40] So they showed off some of the aspects of their new tech, which is the first device is called
[3233.40 → 3233.94] the N1.
[3234.52 → 3238.84] And mostly the talk was a recruitment talk, kind of.
[3238.88 → 3239.50] It was a conference.
[3239.62 → 3240.94] Elon wasn't the only one speaking there.
[3241.02 → 3241.98] There was other people on the team.
[3242.16 → 3245.80] They showed clips of different people on the team with footage from their lab.
[3246.08 → 3247.68] Apparently, they have 100 employees.
[3248.26 → 3248.50] Really?
[3248.50 → 3251.84] I thought it was like a team of like the 12 best experts in the world, but there's like
[3251.84 → 3252.48] 100 people there.
[3252.60 → 3252.74] Wow.
[3252.84 → 3253.06] Okay.
[3253.28 → 3254.00] And it's super cool.
[3254.08 → 3259.02] So what it is basically a small chip, like smaller than the size of your pinky fingernail.
[3259.58 → 3265.04] And that goes just underneath the skull in like a two millimetre wide incision.
[3265.30 → 3269.76] It's such a small incision that you don't even need a stitch when it's over.
[3269.82 → 3272.44] They want the operation to be like getting LAST eye surgery.
[3272.58 → 3276.84] Yeah, kind of like that, kind of like installing the chip in Kinsman.
[3277.58 → 3278.24] Didn't see it.
[3278.24 → 3278.98] Oh, okay.
[3279.36 → 3281.02] So I think you'd like it.
[3281.10 → 3288.04] Attached to the chip is a bunch of these like probes, but they're threads, okay?
[3288.32 → 3292.96] They're not like the stuff that people buy today, which is super expensive and brutal.
[3293.12 → 3295.66] It would be like a spike that goes into your brain.
[3296.54 → 3299.10] And instead, they have these threads.
[3299.30 → 3301.66] They're actually a tenth of the width of a human hair.
[3301.88 → 3304.72] And they go in and each one of them has electrodes in it.
[3304.72 → 3307.58] And so it can receive signals from multiple neurons.
[3307.58 → 3310.30] And then all those threads are connected to that chip.
[3310.44 → 3315.74] That chip then communicates wirelessly to a wearable that you put on your ear, which in
[3315.74 → 3318.58] turn is connected via Bluetooth to your smartphone.
[3318.58 → 3323.20] I must be getting old because this makes me very uncomfortable.
[3323.82 → 3324.48] Oh, it's so cool.
[3326.26 → 3328.80] And so you can actually wear more than one of these.
[3329.00 → 3333.82] So normally this, like the state of the art that they used before, like that spike, you
[3333.82 → 3335.98] just get one, and it'd be like super invasive and everything.
[3335.98 → 3341.24] But these, because they're less invasive, they want to aim for about four, but they can put
[3341.24 → 3343.96] up to 10 in different brain centres around your head.
[3344.40 → 3347.56] And your hair can just grow back over them and there are no cords coming from you.
[3347.60 → 3349.02] So they're super discreet.
[3349.02 → 3350.02] Yeah.
[3350.02 → 3355.40] And the thing that's super cool is they've made this robot to do the surgery to put it
[3355.40 → 3359.06] on because those threads are so fine and small, smaller than human hair.
[3359.44 → 3365.26] This robot with this tiny, tiny needle and this machine vision, which can detect where
[3365.26 → 3369.22] your like brain, your arteries are and veins in your brain where the blood is.
[3369.30 → 3370.48] It can avoid those.
[3370.48 → 3375.96] So it doesn't cause hemorrhaging, and can, it can just insert these threads at different
[3375.96 → 3376.26] places.
[3376.32 → 3379.80] And there's like a thousand threads with like 3000 electrodes each.
[3380.54 → 3382.02] And it does it like in an hour.
[3383.88 → 3384.32] Crazy.
[3385.48 → 3385.92] Yeah.
[3386.02 → 3390.12] So I'm super surprised that they apparently have a product that they apparently are going
[3390.12 → 3392.60] to be trialling on humans by apparently the end of 2020.
[3392.76 → 3396.42] They tested it on a monkey that was able to control a computer with its brain, according
[3396.42 → 3397.62] to Mr. Musk.
[3397.62 → 3402.06] That's not farfetched because there are videos of monkeys controlling computers of their brains
[3402.06 → 3403.00] like 12 years ago.
[3405.34 → 3405.74] Right.
[3405.82 → 3408.80] But it just means that their system like does something at the very least.
[3408.90 → 3411.42] It's not just a, you know, a Kickstarter.
[3412.14 → 3412.30] Yeah.
[3412.34 → 3415.04] Like here's a here's a really thin thread.
[3415.14 → 3418.96] We imagine at some point in the future, it'll detect neural activity, but for now it's just
[3418.96 → 3419.92] drilled into your brain.
[3420.42 → 3420.72] Yeah.
[3420.84 → 3423.38] I think they have like the foremost experts.
[3423.60 → 3424.48] They have a lot of young people.
[3424.62 → 3426.46] A lot of people that video look like they're under 30.
[3426.72 → 3427.08] Interesting.
[3427.62 → 3433.72] Speaking of a lot of young people, a lot of young people are getting off Facebook.
[3433.98 → 3434.12] Okay.
[3434.16 → 3434.72] Last one though.
[3434.80 → 3435.50] I got to go.
[3435.60 → 3436.34] This is the last one.
[3436.60 → 3436.76] Oh.
[3436.92 → 3437.06] Yeah.
[3437.10 → 3439.42] This is just the topics that we highlighted at the beginning.
[3439.86 → 3440.14] Oh.
[3440.22 → 3440.46] Yeah.
[3440.52 → 3442.04] So I wanted to make sure we got through those.
[3442.10 → 3444.06] We're not doing the Samsung RAM thing.
[3445.26 → 3445.92] All right.
[3446.26 → 3448.48] So this was posted on the forum by Flooder.
[3448.60 → 3449.24] Thanks, Flooder.
[3449.66 → 3450.30] Love that name.
[3450.30 → 3455.68] U.S. regulators have approved a record $5 billion fine on Facebook to settle an investigation
[3455.68 → 3460.38] into data privacy violations related to allegations that political consultancy Cambridge Analytica
[3460.38 → 3462.80] improperly obtained the data of up to 87 million Facebook users.
[3462.80 → 3466.58] The sum amounts to around a quarter of the company's yearly profit.
[3467.10 → 3471.26] The investigation focused on whether Facebook had violated a 2011 agreement under which it
[3471.26 → 3476.84] was required to clearly notify users and gain express consent to share their data.
[3477.48 → 3482.60] If confirmed, it would be the largest fine ever levied by the FTC on a tech company, but
[3482.60 → 3486.20] it still needs to be finalized by the Justice Department's civil division, and it's unclear
[3486.20 → 3487.30] how long this may take.
[3487.94 → 3489.78] Investors responded positively to the news.
[3489.86 → 3490.16] Okay, hold on.
[3490.20 → 3491.18] This is the most interesting part.
[3491.26 → 3491.38] Yeah.
[3491.58 → 3496.22] You'd think that the news of being like, hey, you're going to get fined $5 billion would
[3496.22 → 3501.46] make your stock price go down, but actually it made it go up 1.8%, which totally makes
[3501.46 → 3504.96] sense because they knew that this fine was coming down the pike for a long time.
[3505.12 → 3505.28] Yep.
[3505.34 → 3508.56] They didn't know how much it was going to be, but Facebook did think that it was going
[3508.56 → 3513.42] to be in the neighbourhood of $5 billion, and Facebook did put, apparently, almost all
[3513.42 → 3514.08] that aside.
[3514.08 → 3517.66] So the reason that the stock price would go up is because now there's less uncertainty.
[3518.36 → 3518.48] Right.
[3519.46 → 3524.40] We don't know what additional measures and oversight might be placed on the company or
[3524.40 → 3529.20] Mark Zuckerberg himself, but I think what everyone wants to know is where does the money
[3529.20 → 3529.50] go?
[3530.60 → 3535.42] Like, does everyone who had their information sold get compensated for it?
[3535.42 → 3540.32] Apparently, in cases like this, it's the people affected don't get compensated.
[3540.52 → 3543.58] The agency that does the investigation isn't even the one who gets the money.
[3543.94 → 3549.28] Usually, it just goes to the U.S. Treasury for general use.
[3550.04 → 3551.06] So, build a wall.
[3551.58 → 3551.92] Yeah.
[3552.16 → 3554.22] It just goes into the coffers.
[3554.90 → 3555.08] Yeah.
[3555.96 → 3556.24] Sure.
[3557.12 → 3561.12] Do you think that, some people think that this is not enough money, it's a slap on the
[3561.12 → 3563.24] wrist, it's not enough to make a dent or make them care?
[3563.70 → 3566.76] It is 20% of a year's profits, not gross revenue, profits.
[3566.86 → 3567.00] Yeah.
[3567.18 → 3570.06] So, I actually, I have a bit of a different take on that.
[3570.06 → 3577.42] I think that a fine of 20% of a company's profit for the year is much more than a slap on the
[3577.42 → 3577.66] wrist.
[3577.80 → 3583.26] I mean, I think it's very easy for people to say, well, Facebook doesn't care because
[3583.26 → 3585.24] they're going to make four times that much this year.
[3585.96 → 3592.32] But, I mean, if I told you that, you know, you did a terrible thing driving that far
[3592.32 → 3598.28] over the speed limit, I'm fining you a quarter of your salary for the year, you'd probably
[3598.28 → 3599.78] be pretty bummed.
[3600.26 → 3600.52] Yeah.
[3600.54 → 3602.12] The other part of it is they have competitors.
[3602.58 → 3607.40] All their competitors are, you know, everyone's making as much as they can and allocating as
[3607.40 → 3610.28] much as they can to the future, to grow more in the future.
[3610.40 → 3615.30] So, if you didn't plan for that 20%, that inhibits your ability to grow as much as you
[3615.30 → 3617.18] wanted to and then gives your competitors a leg up.
[3617.18 → 3622.20] And the other thing to remember is that this is just one country that has assessed this
[3622.20 → 3626.40] 20% of Facebook's global annual profit fine.
[3626.40 → 3633.34] There's nothing to say that they won't get hit by, and you know what, this Cambridge Analytica
[3633.34 → 3635.18] one specifically, maybe not.
[3635.38 → 3639.18] But there's nothing to say that in the event of some kind of scandal like this, that they
[3639.18 → 3643.00] won't get hit then by the EU and then by Canada, then by someone else.
[3643.00 → 3650.58] And at the end of the day, you know, yeah, Facebook is going to continue to make a lot
[3650.58 → 3651.48] of money, a ton of money.
[3651.94 → 3662.64] But I don't personally buy that 20% of your annual profit is like a slap on the wrist.
[3662.64 → 3670.96] If we got, like, okay, if we got fined 20% of our annual profit, I can tell you as a business
[3670.96 → 3673.00] owner, that would sting.
[3673.42 → 3675.04] That would affect our budgeting.
[3675.28 → 3678.60] That would affect our future plans on our expansion, our growth.
[3679.30 → 3683.28] Especially because this is sort of a Pandora's box.
[3683.28 → 3690.70] Now that I've been fined $5 billion once, I'm certainly at that amount, 20% of my profit,
[3690.88 → 3694.56] I am certainly trying to figure out how to not get hit by that next year.
[3694.80 → 3698.98] So if people are saying, look, this is not a deterrent, I think that's hogwash.
[3699.14 → 3702.62] You think Facebook wants 20% of their profit wiped out every year?
[3703.04 → 3704.66] That's not going to help their stock price.
[3705.50 → 3710.30] I think it's interesting that given that it just goes to the US Treasury for general use,
[3710.30 → 3715.40] it almost gives the government an incentive to make these fines go through.
[3715.56 → 3716.38] That's kind of weird.
[3717.68 → 3722.22] Yeah, government fines are a fascinating thing.
[3722.32 → 3726.62] I mean, that's another thing, too, is like for me as Facebook, I have a lot of uncertainty
[3726.62 → 3727.00] now.
[3727.08 → 3729.70] It's like on the one hand, yeah, you guys done goofed.
[3730.24 → 3733.92] But, you know, they've done a lot of other really stupid stuff over the last couple of
[3733.92 → 3734.38] years, too.
[3734.46 → 3737.56] So I'm kind of sitting there going, oh, crap, now that their scent of blood is in the water,
[3737.56 → 3738.90] what else are they coming after us for?
[3738.98 → 3739.78] And what will the fines be?
[3740.82 → 3746.02] Like, if I'm a Facebook investor, this news does not make me want to spend 1.8% more
[3746.02 → 3747.18] on my Facebook shares.
[3748.36 → 3751.26] Especially because Facebook is such a public target.
[3753.00 → 3757.14] Then again, like, I have to confess, I haven't been following this that closely.
[3757.54 → 3762.04] You know, maybe there's something in this settlement that says the FTC isn't going to go after
[3762.04 → 3763.08] them for anything else.
[3763.50 → 3765.18] Like, I don't know exactly.
[3765.18 → 3765.50] I don't know.
[3766.56 → 3767.46] I don't know.
[3767.46 → 3769.28] But it's not confidence-inspiring for me.
[3769.40 → 3774.42] And I think it's sort of ridiculous to think that Facebook would just shrug this one-off.
[3778.10 → 3778.70] I agree.
[3779.26 → 3779.92] Could be wrong.
[3780.20 → 3780.66] Super chats?
[3781.12 → 3781.42] Yeah.
[3781.52 → 3781.86] Super chats.
[3781.90 → 3782.58] Oh, good reminder.
[3782.70 → 3783.04] Thank you.
[3783.28 → 3783.64] Chris.
[3784.08 → 3784.80] Nerdy Timber.
[3784.80 → 3786.36] Jonas Faraday?
[3786.72 → 3787.08] Freddy.
[3787.58 → 3788.20] Gary Singh.
[3788.86 → 3789.74] Mate, what are you doing?
[3790.50 → 3791.22] See you in a week, dude.
[3791.52 → 3792.88] Is that the Grappler?
[3793.08 → 3793.30] Yeah.
[3793.44 → 3793.58] Yeah.
[3794.32 → 3796.02] Matt Trinidad.
[3796.90 → 3797.30] Demon.
[3798.30 → 3799.16] Gary Singh.
[3799.38 → 3800.14] Rocky Gregory.
[3800.54 → 3801.26] Poops too much.
[3801.80 → 3802.76] It's a shame, Gregory.
[3802.76 → 3804.00] Ethan Lucy.
[3804.26 → 3805.14] William McKay.
[3805.24 → 3806.34] Pablo Diaz.
[3806.82 → 3807.50] What would you get?
[3807.60 → 3810.46] A OnePlus 7 Pro or Pixel 3a XL?
[3811.88 → 3812.92] Need a headphone, Jack?
[3813.72 → 3814.56] Pixel 3a XL.
[3814.68 → 3815.22] Anything else?
[3815.40 → 3816.08] OnePlus 7 Pro?
[3817.08 → 3817.44] No?
[3817.58 → 3819.26] I think I'd get the 7 Pro.
[3820.14 → 3820.46] Really?
[3821.06 → 3822.64] Well, I mean, it depends if you need a headphone, Jack.
[3822.68 → 3823.18] It doesn't have one.
[3826.04 → 3826.94] Dane Carter.
[3827.62 → 3828.02] Thanks.
[3829.18 → 3829.66] LOS.
[3829.70 → 3831.12] You'll hear about the new Nintendo Switch.
[3831.12 → 3831.94] Oh, LOL.
[3832.24 → 3832.40] Yep.
[3832.52 → 3832.78] Yes.
[3833.46 → 3834.80] We talked about that later.
[3835.74 → 3836.18] Sauce Boss.
[3836.56 → 3836.98] Thanks.
[3837.42 → 3838.08] Tommy Gun.
[3838.42 → 3841.48] I demand that you make Channel Super Fun your Game Stream channel.
[3841.60 → 3842.70] Maybe you'll read it this time.
[3842.78 → 3843.20] Okay, I did.
[3844.48 → 3851.60] That won't happen, but Resurrecting Channel Super Fun is kind of on the table lately, so
[3851.60 → 3852.22] stay tuned.
[3854.08 → 3855.10] Just Mark Gaming.
[3855.40 → 3857.58] Are you not going to review the Sony Xperia 1?
[3859.60 → 3860.60] Probably not.
[3861.12 → 3861.78] Adrian Finnegan.
[3861.94 → 3862.20] Hi.
[3862.34 → 3863.00] Michael Hanley.
[3863.28 → 3863.44] Sup?
[3865.66 → 3866.06] Robert.
[3866.56 → 3867.92] It's RC Mail.
[3868.06 → 3869.44] Oh, this is...
[3869.44 → 3870.12] Oh, he's...
[3870.12 → 3871.04] Robert's here.
[3871.54 → 3872.94] It's RC Mail.
[3873.20 → 3874.22] The H is silent.
[3874.44 → 3875.90] Swap the L and the E.
[3876.08 → 3876.80] RC Mail.
[3877.94 → 3878.82] RC Mail.
[3879.18 → 3880.20] So, like, RC guy.
[3880.56 → 3881.26] That helps me.
[3881.94 → 3882.30] Okay.
[3882.38 → 3883.34] That helps me, RC Mail.
[3883.34 → 3883.44] RC Mail.
[3883.82 → 3884.86] Robert C. Mail.
[3885.36 → 3886.40] Midland Productions.
[3886.40 → 3888.70] I want to follow up when I asked about the Dream Studio.
[3888.84 → 3889.60] I know you have one.
[3889.68 → 3892.06] I was referring to if you bought land and built from scratch.
[3892.22 → 3892.38] Oh!
[3893.52 → 3896.70] Well, if I bought land and built from scratch, that would be quite a dream, because I don't
[3896.70 → 3900.16] know if you've looked at land prices in the Lower Mainland any time recently, but it's
[3900.16 → 3901.50] in the neighbourhood of...
[3901.50 → 3903.64] $9 million for a pitch and putt course, baby.
[3903.74 → 3904.72] Yeah, we saw that today.
[3904.72 → 3905.92] That's the next LTT campus.
[3906.06 → 3906.32] Yeah.
[3906.72 → 3908.76] 24 acres in South Surrey.
[3908.82 → 3909.46] $9 million.
[3910.12 → 3911.00] We all pitch in.
[3911.40 → 3912.02] We can get it.
[3913.08 → 3914.84] Send us Super Chats, guys.
[3914.92 → 3915.96] We need your Super Chats.
[3916.04 → 3917.76] We'll buy 24 acres.
[3918.06 → 3919.56] We all pitch in and putt.
[3919.96 → 3920.30] Ah!
[3920.70 → 3922.00] That was the joke, Nick.
[3923.10 → 3923.40] Yeah.
[3924.02 → 3924.64] Yeah, Nick.
[3924.64 → 3926.62] I'm a non-dad here, and I have the best dad jokes.
[3926.64 → 3927.24] Yeah, I made that.
[3927.60 → 3928.40] Distro Tube.
[3928.54 → 3930.18] Have you considered switching to Linux?
[3930.18 → 3934.36] Yes, I've considered it, but there's a lot of software I need to use.
[3934.36 → 3935.52] His name is Distro Tube.
[3935.60 → 3936.82] Runs on Windows.
[3937.74 → 3940.22] Frederick, would you be open to making more pro content?
[3941.24 → 3943.86] Probably not that much.
[3943.98 → 3949.82] You know, we love being that sort of, you know, fun window into really high-end pro cool stuff
[3949.82 → 3951.56] sometimes, but it's not really our focus.
[3955.02 → 3955.42] Eduardo.
[3955.62 → 3956.70] Linus, it's been a good run.
[3956.78 → 3957.86] You're going to get Susan'd.
[3959.22 → 3959.96] I don't know.
[3959.96 → 3961.92] I know what that is, and you're right.
[3962.24 → 3967.40] Maybe she's personally making sure that our stream doesn't stop buffering.
[3968.10 → 3969.72] Are we talking about that, Susan, or a different Susan?
[3969.80 → 3970.14] I assume.
[3970.62 → 3971.04] Yeah, okay.
[3972.04 → 3974.16] Okay, I can only have time for a couple more.
[3975.96 → 3980.12] What if those $5 million was ransom money for some kidnappers, so after you took it, they
[3980.12 → 3981.42] never found them and killed the kid?
[3981.78 → 3984.92] Well, that's why I would check the news, because I'm sure that would show up in the news.
[3984.98 → 3985.12] See?
[3985.20 → 3985.90] I've got that covered.
[3985.90 → 3989.16] I would be like, here's the $4 million, guys.
[3989.48 → 3990.34] Save the kid.
[3990.42 → 3994.48] And, like, you'd be rushed by, like, waiting police if it was, wouldn't you?
[3994.66 → 3997.82] Drake Simmons says, dang it, now I have to buy a second water bottle.
[3998.12 → 3999.04] The stealth one is sweet.
[3999.18 → 3999.66] It is sweet.
[3999.68 → 4002.74] I don't mind, but I am bummed that I already bought the black hat.
[4002.84 → 4003.86] Can I get a virtual hug?
[4004.42 → 4004.74] Yes.
[4005.22 → 4005.54] Yes.
[4005.62 → 4006.74] You need two hats, man.
[4006.86 → 4010.80] You need one that you wear to the gym and, like, when your hay baling and stuff, and
[4010.80 → 4012.00] then you need a good dress hat.
[4012.00 → 4012.54] Dress hat.
[4012.54 → 4014.84] When you get new shoes and stuff, it's sharp.
[4015.00 → 4015.28] It's black.
[4015.38 → 4015.72] It's sharp.
[4016.16 → 4017.24] So, guys, just a reminder.
[4017.40 → 4022.96] If you add the stealth hoodie, the stealth version of the LTT water bottle, and the black
[4022.96 → 4027.48] hat all to your cart on ltdstore.com, you will get an automatic $20 discount applied, which
[4027.48 → 4028.88] is basically like getting a free hat.
[4029.60 → 4029.84] Yeah.
[4030.00 → 4033.68] And the only thing that was as popular as this water bottle so far in the first hour was
[4033.68 → 4034.54] the first water bottle.
[4034.68 → 4035.34] The first water bottle.
[4035.48 → 4035.68] Okay.
[4035.74 → 4036.34] People love water.
[4036.96 → 4037.92] People need water.
[4037.92 → 4038.28] Oh, are these doing really well?
[4038.42 → 4038.60] Yeah.
[4038.80 → 4039.40] Oh, cool.
[4040.08 → 4040.76] They're selling well.
[4040.76 → 4042.80] I mean, I think we knew that.
[4043.12 → 4044.50] Like, black on black.
[4045.94 → 4047.50] You can never lose.
[4048.04 → 4049.28] Thanks for whining with us, guys.
[4049.52 → 4050.00] All right.
[4050.32 → 4051.44] So, thanks, guys.
[4051.54 → 4053.26] And we will see you again next week.
[4053.32 → 4054.22] Say, oh, no.
[4054.36 → 4057.06] We will see you again next week at a different time.
[4057.60 → 4058.76] It's going to be on Saturday.
[4058.90 → 4061.20] We're going to be streaming from LTX.
[4061.28 → 4061.50] Oh.
[4062.24 → 4062.46] Yeah.
[4062.48 → 4063.88] That's going to be one of the panels.
[4064.30 → 4064.58] All right.
[4064.62 → 4065.30] See you there, guys.
[4066.44 → 4066.84] All right.
[4067.02 → 4067.48] Sorry, James.
[4067.48 → 4067.80] You can go.
[4067.80 → 4071.14] Well, maybe I don't want to play some games.
[4071.72 → 4072.14] I'm deaf.
[4072.78 → 4073.64] I got to call my friend.
[4073.80 → 4074.76] I'm supposed to be there.

[4086.08 → 4089.36] This is just like a new message in the creator studio.
[4089.58 → 4089.84] Did everybody?
[4090.14 → 4090.78] I don't know.
[4091.46 → 4092.20] So weird.
[4092.20 → 4121.34] Thanks.
