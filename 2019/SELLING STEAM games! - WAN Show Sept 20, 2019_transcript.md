[0.96 --> 8.56]  come one come all to the when show i hope this computer is working i haven't actually turned it
[8.56 --> 16.64]  on yet oh boy and then you're gonna get prompted to bios update did you do it no i haven't i think
[16.64 --> 22.80]  it might actually just be broken oh wow which would be spectacular we're off to a great start
[22.80 --> 28.00]  today guys awesome we got some interesting some some great and some weird news uh steam users have
[28.00 --> 34.40]  the right to sell their digital games as far as i know just in france or so says a french court valve
[34.40 --> 42.56]  has vowed to fight the ruling so let's see how that goes for them interesting in other news um ufd tech
[42.56 --> 49.60]  is moving out from south africa back to the united states in order to seek better better medical care
[49.60 --> 54.88]  for his son we'll be able to discuss that a little bit later facebook plans to create an independent
[54.88 --> 62.56]  oversight board oh yeah and uh youtube just dunked a huge amount of creators verification badges
[63.28 --> 68.88]  thanks guys i happen to know someone who used to be verified who is no longer verified
[68.88 --> 74.32]  you probably know i will tell you where i will tell you later that's my hook that's my hook intro
[74.32 --> 82.00]  i think like almost everyone does
[82.00 --> 90.64]  the one
[95.44 --> 108.64]  squarespace and see sonic oh see sonic a sponsor today yeah cool all right let's go ahead and see if my
[108.64 --> 114.32]  laptop's working and one two oh wow look at that okay cool we're on we're on we got we got a show
[114.32 --> 119.04]  today nice background lucky thanks i actually have no idea where that came from i think it's just one
[119.04 --> 122.88]  of the windows images yeah it's probably an hp thing they probably they probably included that
[122.88 --> 130.88]  that makes sense so why don't we jump right into the headline topic yes french court has ruled that steam
[133.52 --> 137.84]  should okay you know what here let's go let's go through let's go through our detailed notes first and
[137.84 --> 143.36]  then we'll actually then we'll actually discuss so a new ruling by a french court has the potential to
[143.36 --> 148.80]  radically alter the way people buy sell and play video games particularly online because the way that
[148.80 --> 155.52]  we used to buy sell and play video games back in the day of the physical cartridges was already like this
[156.40 --> 163.28]  i could go to a store where they from a manufacturer presumably receive a shipment of games
[163.28 --> 172.48]  i could buy it and then once i bought it yes it was still governed by a licensing agreement it was a
[172.48 --> 179.52]  license for the software i didn't own it the source code wasn't mine but this copy of it was effectively
[180.08 --> 186.56]  mine to do with as i pleased i could a certain degree i could lend it to you and then i could get it back
[186.56 --> 193.44]  from you later i could sell it to you and then never get it back from you i could lend it to you and
[193.44 --> 196.40]  never get it back from you that's another one that happened a lot that happened a lot
[199.12 --> 205.28]  okay i think i might still have a couple games or i could take it back to the store and you know get
[205.28 --> 214.00]  a trade-in credit towards another game i could be a store whose entire business r.i.p is to except for
[214.00 --> 219.12]  willow video games except for willow video games yeah you are such a willow fan i love those guys
[219.12 --> 225.60]  how do they still exist probably me no i haven't even been in there in months but um they still rent
[225.60 --> 232.40]  videos i know right like that's a notable amount of their business it's crazy isn't it um i have a
[232.40 --> 236.48]  copy of fanboys at home that my sister said i should watch she said i'd like it i've actually never
[236.48 --> 240.88]  seen the movie but it has it has a blockbuster sticker on the top of it so clearly it was one of their
[240.88 --> 247.20]  rentals at one point anyway the point is it used to be that back when the game license was effectively
[247.20 --> 255.68]  tied to a physical object um there were rules that sort of intrinsically existed and they still do
[255.68 --> 262.72]  for physical copies of games but for years french consumer rights group ufc not that ufc
[264.72 --> 269.60]  have been embroiled in a legal battle with valve corporation over several clauses in the company's
[269.60 --> 275.04]  steam user agreement particularly the one that states that you don't actually own games that
[275.04 --> 282.72]  you purchase on their digital storefront you are merely subscribing for an undetermined period of time
[282.72 --> 290.16]  to the games in your library so here's the thing though this clause means that steam users don't have
[290.16 --> 295.84]  certain basic consumer rights like for example the ability to resell the games they buy now yeah valve
[295.84 --> 301.76]  has gotten quite a bit more flexible over the way that people use their steam games over the years
[301.76 --> 309.12]  i still remember what a big deal it was when luke figured out that thanks to a new rule from valve
[309.12 --> 317.28]  he could mooch off of the linus tech tips steam account and play all the latest games because i
[317.28 --> 322.96]  wouldn't care because effectively i was getting uh deeper save games that i could use for benchmarking
[322.96 --> 327.68]  and he wins because he gets to play single player gaming experiences without buying the game yeah
[328.00 --> 332.48]  everybody everyone's a winner it was great i was okay with it i noticed none of none of your pcs are
[332.48 --> 336.80]  actually i think you i think your stream just buys you every game now don't they pretty much wow
[337.52 --> 340.64]  you're such a you're still a mooch you know uh you found a better way to move i don't even have to
[340.64 --> 347.12]  ask anymore i was uh okay what what's that huge new game cyberpunk cyberpunk's not even going to be out
[347.12 --> 352.48]  for a while and i like talked on stream for a little bit about how like i'll probably be playing that game
[352.48 --> 357.12]  because it seems really cool and then someone just bought it for me and i was like oh great sweet
[360.80 --> 364.56]  it was awesome first first you sleep in the bed of the dead guy
[367.28 --> 372.24]  i haven't replaced that you take all his cutlery yeah okay then you have people buying
[372.24 --> 378.00]  you're not ashamed at all still got his couch his couch is wonderful it's great okay okay for context
[378.00 --> 383.52]  guys and his computer chair for context guys this was an estate sale for luke's house it came fully
[383.52 --> 389.60]  furnished he didn't like steal it or anything he bought it it's just a little weird that he kept it
[389.60 --> 395.76]  all i didn't keep all of it i got rid of some of it you sold it didn't you um it the stuff that i got
[395.76 --> 398.72]  rid of was not really worth like it wouldn't have nobody would have bought it
[398.72 --> 407.92]  anywho so to valve's credit over the years they've actually gotten a lot more flexible with things like
[407.92 --> 413.92]  family sharing which they haven't even locked down the same way that spotify is planning to with their
[413.92 --> 419.12]  family plan where you're all supposed to be at the same address and stuff so no but they will invalidate
[419.12 --> 424.88]  it every once in a while they do and you have to be like kind of nearby yeah but it's nothing that
[424.88 --> 430.32]  can't be solved with a quick team viewer session yeah so it's not really they're not aggressive a
[430.32 --> 438.48]  big deal yeah exactly they could be locking it down yeah far tighter and they're not but something
[438.48 --> 444.32]  that people have been upset with valve about for many many years is the fact that you can't return a
[444.32 --> 449.60]  game basically after you've opened it although they did loosen that i think you can play it for
[449.60 --> 454.56]  like 20 minutes or something now i forget two hours two hours but i think it's fairly unofficial
[454.56 --> 458.32]  but two hours seems to be the like if you ask for a refund within two hours you'll pretty much
[458.32 --> 464.32]  just get it kind of limit so they've even got more flexible about that but you cannot resell
[464.32 --> 470.48]  your games when you are done with them they just sit in your library forever i have like 240 games in
[470.48 --> 476.40]  my library i have a kind of a fun video that i'm planning coming up um so i might stream maybe on
[476.40 --> 480.72]  floatplane or something that'd be kind of fun but i might stream yeah you love you love anytime i say
[480.72 --> 488.24]  the f word you're so happy um but yeah so i might stream it but then also cut it together as a
[488.24 --> 494.88]  youtube video okay i'm gonna play every unopened game in my steam library every unopened so all zero
[494.88 --> 500.96]  minute played yeah wow were you on the humble bundle stuff at all oh yeah oh in the early days
[503.52 --> 508.64]  yeah until i realized that my steam library was just cluttered up with garbage that i've never played
[508.64 --> 513.12]  and some gems that i've never played so we'll find out which is which yeah i'm very sure i've never
[513.12 --> 519.36]  played ftl for example i i have owned it for like six years i love that game i know you do yeah yeah
[519.36 --> 523.44]  you had some ship or something you're gonna beat some mission i don't know it was in your stream oh i
[523.44 --> 529.68]  did the no shield i did the no shield challenge yeah who cares who cares sounds lame such a nerd it was
[529.68 --> 537.20]  really hard i'm pretty yeah i'm proud of that did you do it i did okay good job thanks nerd um okay
[538.24 --> 545.76]  so the district court of paris has struck down the notion that steam sells subscriptions according to
[545.76 --> 552.72]  the court steam sells game licenses much in the same way that you owned a game license back when you bought
[552.72 --> 558.80]  a disc or that you own a movie license when you buy a blu-ray or whatever the case may be and that
[558.80 --> 564.72]  consumers ought to have the right to do what they want with them the court also took valve to task
[564.72 --> 569.60]  for other practices like holding on to steam wallet funds when players leave the platform
[569.60 --> 574.72]  their unclear moderation policies not accepting responsibility if users computers are harmed by
[574.72 --> 580.72]  software even betas sold on their platform now the legal battle isn't over yet our notes say valve
[580.72 --> 585.20]  is certain to appeal which is an indication that these notes were done in the morning because valve
[585.20 --> 593.44]  has already said they are going to appeal um and it's and like regardless of the outcome of valve's
[593.44 --> 599.76]  appeal this could set off a series of similar challenges across the eu and therefore potentially
[599.76 --> 607.76]  elsewhere in the world and this is big too uh ufc kush was yours has said that they plan to directly
[607.76 --> 615.28]  challenge other digital products and platforms so i mean another great example of this to my knowledge
[615.28 --> 621.04]  once you have activated it there's no way to sell a windows 10 license yeah they could end up going
[621.04 --> 629.68]  after freaking microsoft what and that would actually be pretty funky yeah a lot of this would be really
[629.68 --> 638.00]  funky what do you think um i want i want like kind of two different answers one gaming platforms
[638.80 --> 643.84]  steam origin you play all that kind of stuff two software all other software okay
[646.24 --> 653.04]  gaming platforms i as a consumer did you want me as a consumer me as a business owner which hat should i
[653.04 --> 658.48]  wear i think i think it's an overall what do you think's best for like the world you're gonna get
[658.48 --> 666.00]  different hats i like it that works is that your business owner how about me as santa this gives me
[666.00 --> 673.60]  less to give away so i'm i'm gonna i'm gonna go with um santa's kind of a business owner right okay okay
[673.60 --> 685.44]  so as a business owner it's goods um i see games as um okay i see the inability of people to resell games
[685.44 --> 694.08]  as necessary to enable to enable the ongoing existence of certain gaming experiences okay and
[694.08 --> 702.00]  i'm gonna explain what i mean by that so cod is not going to be affected by this because for the entire
[702.00 --> 708.24]  lifespan that cod is still actively being purchased like a particular cod game right it's all about the
[708.24 --> 714.56]  multiplayer experience nobody nobody's buying a cod game in order to play through the single player campaign
[714.56 --> 719.60]  and then like be done the game you you pick out you pick it up every once in a while i'm sure
[719.60 --> 726.24]  there's three of you don't freak out yeah yeah all dozens of you sorry um so so so so something like
[726.24 --> 733.28]  a dota 2 where obviously the business model has moved on right yeah from from the from the single purchase
[733.28 --> 741.36]  and then um you know people just play against each other like forever paradigm like that that's not
[741.36 --> 747.36]  sustainable unless you do you know community created servers much like older games used to yeah
[747.36 --> 752.64]  so it's free dota 2 yeah yeah i know okay yeah no that's why i was using dota 2 as an example of
[752.64 --> 759.04]  something has that has moved on from the paradigm of a single purchase and then the developer just kind
[759.04 --> 763.92]  of going okay the game's done we're gonna make our next game we're gonna make dota 3 right like that
[763.92 --> 770.24]  that paradigm is sort of a sort of it's not dead but many genres have moved past it particularly in the
[770.24 --> 779.60]  multiplayer space yeah but what about single player what do they do they have to either do i mean you
[779.60 --> 783.76]  know what i'm not going to call them dlcs i'm going to call them expansion packs because for whatever
[783.76 --> 789.20]  reason expansion pack is still an okay word to say but dlc is a dirty one they're the same damn thing
[789.20 --> 796.64]  so so single player could do dlcs they could add extra dungeons or campaigns or characters or equipment and
[796.64 --> 801.84]  and they could expand on the game and get you to keep contributing towards their development efforts
[801.84 --> 807.04]  that way or they could move on to the next game and say okay that game is done um
[809.20 --> 817.12]  and the problem with that is that i think for a lot of consumers they're kind of done with that game
[817.68 --> 824.64]  once they've played through it because i don't know about you but for me i i don't find that any
[824.64 --> 829.68]  single player experience has ever kept me in for very long by just throwing more dlcs or more
[829.68 --> 837.04]  expansion packs at me it's extremely uncommon that i'll even go back like a like a new dlc will come
[837.04 --> 842.56]  out or whatever i'm not going to go back for a dlc if like back in the warcraft days i'd buy an expansion
[842.56 --> 849.12]  because it's an entirely different freaking game but like warcraft frozen throne was okay warcraft 3 yes
[849.12 --> 855.84]  warcraft 2 i would make the argument that uh what is it beyond the dark portal is not a different game
[855.84 --> 861.44]  it's like some maps oh okay see but that's something i wouldn't come back for right so in that situation
[861.44 --> 868.88]  i it's very unlikely and even a game that is it's very hard for me to say this because final fantasy 6
[868.88 --> 873.60]  holds a very special place in my heart but even for a game that is arguably my favorite game of all
[873.60 --> 878.16]  time breath of the wild is a great game i didn't even bother to play the dlc it's like no i beat ganon
[878.16 --> 884.80]  and i'm done yeah um it feels and it also feels very weird coming back to those games so here's
[884.80 --> 892.96]  the problem um particularly games that are story like narrative driven games are kind of done once
[892.96 --> 900.88]  you finish the narrative content um and in the old days a lot of the time games were kind of um
[902.00 --> 907.68]  simpler like something like a pilot wings uh first nest did you ever play pilot wings yeah i didn't play
[907.68 --> 911.28]  it back in the day actually but i've played it more recently it was more about like playing fun
[911.28 --> 915.76]  little mini games it was a pack of mini games and so there's there's no story or anything so you know
[915.76 --> 920.64]  i i don't feel like as a game developer i'm at risk of i feel like this argument has gotten very meandry
[920.64 --> 929.68]  and i'm very sorry the point is depending on the gaming experience there is no way for a game developer
[929.68 --> 937.52]  to incentivize players who have already made their lump sum purchase and own the game to keep playing
[937.52 --> 945.68]  it and keep wanting to own it there's just no practical way to do it and the unfortunate thing
[945.68 --> 952.80]  about digital distribution is that digital distribution works not just for a game publisher
[952.80 --> 960.72]  but also for a user so if there's a way for me to effectively become a digital distributor of my
[960.72 --> 968.16]  personal game library then the advantage of digital distribution is that you've got this enormous
[968.16 --> 975.04]  customer base so back in the day it wasn't as much of a concern because the barriers that naturally
[975.04 --> 982.64]  existed for physical media like finding a buyer and shipping a physical game cartridge to someone
[982.64 --> 992.08]  or delivering it to their house made it less prevalent um whereas now the ease with which you could
[992.08 --> 999.20]  resell something and and flip it effectively reducing the original seller's ability to sell another copy
[999.20 --> 1008.80]  to that person is incredible so what happens to the game developers who now really will like i don't
[1008.80 --> 1014.24]  have to do a study to prove this it's it's very obvious the game developers who really will sell
[1015.36 --> 1022.40]  many many fewer copies of their games if they happen to be a style of gameplay that lends itself to
[1022.40 --> 1027.04]  playing through once being done with it and just wanting to get rid of it like this game i just brought
[1027.04 --> 1035.60]  up vvvvv it was one of the old school uh humble bundle games yeah there's billions of these out
[1035.60 --> 1041.20]  here my stream gave away probably potentially in the hundreds because i've had this weird thing that
[1041.20 --> 1047.12]  we used to do if everyone that had this game suddenly was like i'm just going to sell it you
[1047.12 --> 1053.52]  right click on you click sell go ah put it 0.1 under current undercut market value whatever let's go
[1053.52 --> 1057.84]  it's going to be a couple pennies right now it's selling for five dollars and 49 cents that developer
[1058.48 --> 1064.00]  is just going to get nothing from what they made now so digital is like too easy so there is an
[1064.00 --> 1069.36]  argument to be made remember i have my uh my like game developer publisher i have my business hat on
[1069.36 --> 1075.28]  right now um so so from from a business person or from a consumer perspective here i think i need a new hat
[1076.56 --> 1082.24]  one moment please what's the consumer going to be um you could like low-key mock them and wear a clown hat
[1082.24 --> 1091.04]  i i was thinking about it but i'm gonna go with this nice okay so from a consumer perspective
[1092.80 --> 1099.20]  that's not my problem really good choice true yeah you developed your game and you got paid for it
[1099.20 --> 1108.24]  and what you want to be paid for this game forever get a job make a new game no no i mean come up with a
[1108.24 --> 1115.36]  new idea i want more games to play i'm done playing this game i paid my money i should get something
[1115.36 --> 1121.92]  back for it because i'm done with it i don't need this anymore i think it would hurt indie games a lot
[1121.92 --> 1127.92]  which makes me sad that makes me not want to be on board okay so i'll just be me now as as consumer hat
[1127.92 --> 1134.88]  that's me being consumer hat so my favorite game in the last i don't know year whatever i'll pick an
[1134.88 --> 1141.04]  arbitrary period of time ever since i played breath of the wild um is uh an indie game it's very small
[1141.04 --> 1146.48]  very small development studio uh that made a game called crosscode um did you ever play it i played
[1146.48 --> 1153.44]  it a little bit you suck okay so crosscode is uh like an old school jrpg style game but it's actually
[1153.44 --> 1157.92]  i think a mostly western development team i've played it since then i just haven't played a ton because i
[1157.92 --> 1160.88]  told you i i don't want to play it on stream it doesn't feel like a stream game that's fine you just
[1160.88 --> 1165.12]  suck that's what's going to take me forever to finish it yeah it's fine that you suck like it's
[1165.12 --> 1173.76]  cool like that's your life choice what a jerk um anyway sorry sorry so really small development studio
[1174.40 --> 1179.92]  um and they're actually these guys are so incredible because they're actually still adding content to the
[1179.92 --> 1187.28]  game even though the you know initial rush of people buying it is is clearly far from over and
[1187.28 --> 1192.64]  they're doing free dlc they're not asking for any additional money for it um there's no subscription
[1192.64 --> 1197.28]  fee to pay it pay it there's nothing like that it's one and done and they keep adding content super cool
[1197.28 --> 1206.32]  guys um i don't know how they could possibly survive if people were able to sell this game once they were
[1206.32 --> 1212.48]  done with it because it's very narrative and character driven and now that i finished i might do a
[1212.48 --> 1219.04]  couple arena challenges but that's not gonna that's not gonna entertain me i'm i'm sitting here
[1219.04 --> 1223.76]  bated breath for crosscode 2 which will probably take another seven years or however long the first
[1223.76 --> 1230.40]  one took them um so the thing is that while they did probably make a bunch of money on this game
[1231.28 --> 1233.44]  developing it selling it um
[1233.44 --> 1244.96]  um the feast and famine game development model is not sustainable that has been basically proven where
[1244.96 --> 1251.04]  you where you invest really heavily in something and you're you're kind of you're running on fumes
[1251.04 --> 1257.44]  by the time it's finally time to release it you get this huge influx of money and then you go
[1257.44 --> 1264.32]  okay i want to hear everyone's best pitch what's the next gigantic gamble that we take that is either
[1264.32 --> 1273.92]  going to make us or break us as a company okay go let's do it again that is not sustainable so um
[1275.68 --> 1282.80]  i i actually you know what i'm gonna say it i'm gonna say that the benefits of digital distribution
[1282.80 --> 1287.52]  things like uh steam summer sales which maybe haven't been that great in recent years but
[1287.52 --> 1291.68]  certainly it used to be killer a better deal than it used to be going to the local london
[1291.68 --> 1298.40]  drugs and buying a game so the fact that discounts are so readily available um the fact that cloud
[1298.40 --> 1303.84]  auto saves are a thing wow they're amazing i love it um what else can you think of that's great about
[1303.84 --> 1308.64]  digital distribution the fact that you can buy a game in the middle of the night and then just play
[1308.64 --> 1315.20]  it immediately it's freaking awesome library sync so like oh you set up a new laptop it doesn't have
[1315.20 --> 1319.44]  a disk drive you can just download all your things immediately you don't have to worry about it yep
[1319.44 --> 1324.56]  uh digital rights management and i don't mean that from a restrictive sense i mean that from a management
[1324.56 --> 1331.12]  sense so having the digital rights to share my game library with luke so he can play that game if i'm
[1331.12 --> 1337.44]  not playing it right now i am going to go ahead and say that from my perspective the benefits of digital
[1337.44 --> 1345.84]  distribution have been so great that i am willing to give up my right to sell games um i can see how
[1345.84 --> 1353.60]  you could make an argument i kind of wish there was a solid alternative like i i wish that i could go
[1353.60 --> 1359.12]  out and buy more physical copies of games i've brought that up a lot and i would do that for a lot of games
[1359.12 --> 1364.00]  there's a lot of games where i'm like i'm fairly certain i'm gonna like this a lot and it's not gonna
[1364.00 --> 1369.84]  necessarily be super popular with everybody so i want to buy it so i can hand it to my friend so he
[1369.84 --> 1375.92]  can go play it and then in a lot of cases being adults now if i can tell they're really interested
[1375.92 --> 1380.40]  i might even be like hey give it back and then they have to buy it themselves if i want to support the
[1380.40 --> 1385.20]  company very much or whatever that's another thing that sometimes it's hard for me to keep track of is
[1385.20 --> 1391.76]  that i am an adult now i have you know a real job sort of um but the point is i make enough money that
[1391.76 --> 1396.48]  spending fifty dollars or sixty dollars or twenty dollars or whatever it is on a game periodically
[1396.48 --> 1405.28]  is not a huge deal for me um and i guess that's where you have to try to like how do you like how
[1405.28 --> 1408.88]  do you solve i've tried to be somewhat reasonable about certain things like rocket league yeah i've
[1408.88 --> 1413.12]  played a crazy amount of rocket league yeah so every once in a while i'll be i'll buy one of their like
[1413.12 --> 1418.64]  past things right but i don't buy them all the time well only if i'm gonna play like a lot for a while
[1418.64 --> 1426.08]  because i'm like okay well i got way more massively more value out of the original purchase that i like
[1426.08 --> 1430.64]  probably should have so i'll throw them a few extra bones now they're part of epic so i don't care that
[1430.64 --> 1435.52]  much but what i'm thinking about is more like back in the day when i was a student and i wasted all my
[1435.52 --> 1441.68]  money on my computer hardware so i didn't have any money for games you know not having that as an option
[1441.68 --> 1447.36]  kind of sucks but then again that was right around the time like my like early university days late high
[1447.36 --> 1451.44]  school days was right around the time steam started to actually gain some traction yeah um
[1452.48 --> 1459.92]  and i switched over pretty quickly not completely because every once in a while a physical copy of
[1459.92 --> 1467.04]  the game would be cheaper so i own far cry for example on five cds um don't want to talk about it
[1471.28 --> 1476.16]  that's amazing yeah it's so stupid anyway um actually i think that was slightly before steam
[1476.16 --> 1480.32]  took anyway it doesn't matter the point is there's like games from after the steam era that i like
[1480.32 --> 1487.84]  own on like a bunch of cds or something stupid i couldn't find the dvd copy um but by and large i did
[1487.84 --> 1491.68]  switch to buying them digitally even though i didn't have a ton of money at the time but i would just wait
[1491.68 --> 1496.24]  for them to be on sale it's just that a lot of the time yeah because the physical media business the
[1496.24 --> 1502.32]  physical games business was struggling so much they were doing deeper discounts than digital which made no
[1502.32 --> 1507.76]  sense because like a physical item had to be like stamped and boxed and like shipped somewhere yeah
[1508.24 --> 1515.04]  and warehouse um yeah i think for i think the most frustrating series of time for me was when they
[1515.04 --> 1519.36]  first started shifting over to like oh you buy the physical copy and there isn't even a disc in it
[1519.36 --> 1524.72]  there's just a code in the box that was dumb that was that was pretty i think there's like still doing
[1524.72 --> 1530.08]  that yeah and that's just stupid i remember working at ncix we'd be doing like a game promo partnered with
[1530.08 --> 1535.92]  intel or nvidia or whatever where your graphics card would come with a free game and like it would
[1535.92 --> 1542.48]  come with a box that would just have a steam code and we're like why why are we shipping this yeah
[1542.48 --> 1548.64]  like are you guys idiots yeah can you stop can you just give me a piece of paper yeah coupons later
[1548.64 --> 1558.16]  yeah great yeah it was a really good thing um all right so someone in chat luke i'm suing bethesda
[1558.16 --> 1560.64]  over that exact issue you're suing them
[1563.84 --> 1572.72]  how go go ham good luck yeah zenimax is a pretty experienced litigator as companies go they're uh
[1572.72 --> 1580.08]  they're pretty down to fight in courts yeah um so good luck everybody yeah um all right speaking of
[1580.08 --> 1587.12]  good luck everybody um wishing the best to ufd tech um brett's going to be moving his family back to
[1587.12 --> 1592.64]  the united states in order to seek better medical care for his son uh so brett's son has syngap one
[1592.64 --> 1598.32]  uh basically it's a disorder that causes seizures and is has been very challenging for them to treat
[1599.28 --> 1605.04]  this situation is developing very quickly um so the family has been forced to move very abruptly
[1605.04 --> 1609.92]  he released a video you guys should go check it out uh we've actually got a link down below there's a
[1609.92 --> 1615.44]  bunch of ways that you can help out brett one of them is he's got to go fund me um another one is he's on
[1615.44 --> 1622.16]  patreon another one is of course you can subscribe on floatplane um he also does streams on twitch uf
[1622.16 --> 1628.48]  disciple they have merch over on teespring uh but basically their their plan is to be back in the u.s
[1628.48 --> 1633.52]  by the end of the year maybe sooner they're moving to florida where there's better doctors available for
[1633.52 --> 1641.60]  his condition um however this is going to be a period like i i don't get the i don't get the impression
[1641.60 --> 1648.00]  that he's asking for a handout um brett's one of those guys that uh whatever you might think about
[1648.00 --> 1651.84]  the content not everybody likes it that's fine that's cool but brett's one of those guys that
[1651.84 --> 1657.76]  has clearly reinvested um a lot of his youtube earnings in his business trying to make ufd tech
[1657.76 --> 1664.72]  a real business um so i don't think that this is just um a cynical cash grab or anything i think that
[1664.72 --> 1670.08]  they really do need some funds in order to help them uh get through this transition because it's going to
[1670.08 --> 1674.24]  be very difficult not just for brett and his family but for the other members of the ufd team
[1674.24 --> 1682.40]  at this time um none of the other members of their team have u.s visas so uh he's basically been
[1682.40 --> 1688.40]  selling all the camera equipment it looks like he's going to have to disband the team um so his channel
[1688.40 --> 1693.60]  i'd be surprised if he doesn't come back making videos again at some point i mean you got to have a
[1693.60 --> 1699.28]  job you got to support your family especially um if you're getting medical care in the u.s yeah
[1700.24 --> 1704.96]  um so like i'm sure there's going to be videos but you know they might take on a bit of a different
[1704.96 --> 1711.52]  form and they might need a little bit of help bridging the gap here so um i'm not much of a i'm
[1711.52 --> 1717.60]  not i'm not mr beast i'm not going to be like surprising random twitch streamers with donations
[1717.60 --> 1722.40]  live or anything but i'll be making a personal contribution um and i just thought i'd bring it up on
[1722.40 --> 1726.32]  the stream so that you guys are aware of the situation i mean the tech whether it's austin's
[1726.32 --> 1732.40]  house burning down or what's going on right now with ufd tech i think the tech tuber community has
[1732.40 --> 1738.72]  sort of an i wouldn't call it an obligation but has a um a tendency to kind of stick together and
[1738.72 --> 1742.64]  support each other so yeah just want to make sure that you guys know what's going on down there
[1742.64 --> 1748.80]  they're doing pretty the only numbers i can i can see or say publicly because i guess we have
[1748.80 --> 1753.76]  flow planes um but the only numbers i can say publicly as far as i know is the gofundme one
[1753.76 --> 1759.68]  and they're at like almost 53 000 now wow that's awesome of a ten thousand dollar goal that's a big
[1759.68 --> 1768.00]  deal but again medical stuff in america so yeah that's like uh three hours i think maybe well i i
[1768.00 --> 1772.48]  actually don't know i know that it's ridiculous yeah i have no clue i have i don't know how to scale
[1772.48 --> 1777.36]  that at all i remember finding out how much it costs to have a baby yeah in america i was like
[1778.32 --> 1784.08]  what it was free here yeah well i mean nothing's free you probably had to pay for parking yeah like
[1784.08 --> 1790.24]  i yeah oh yeah and parking at the hospital it's expensive but like in the grand scheme of things
[1790.24 --> 1795.60]  it was you know over the six day period or whatever and plus people visits like 70 bucks or really yeah
[1795.60 --> 1801.52]  yeah grand scheme of things nothing um compared to like tens of thousands of dollars which is
[1801.52 --> 1805.36]  apparently what it costs down in the states if you are not insured do you even have to pay for food
[1805.36 --> 1811.36]  because they like feed you in the hospital right they probably feed like the admitted i mean like
[1811.36 --> 1816.16]  maybe you had to get your own food yeah yeah i mean i had to pay for my own food yeah yeah yeah only
[1816.16 --> 1824.16]  only the person in the hospital yeah gets food yeah um but even that like wow okay yeah so pretty uh
[1824.16 --> 1830.00]  pretty crazy stuff guys best of luck um speaking of best of luck um
[1835.12 --> 1840.80]  best of luck making a fantastic website for yourself on squarespace we use squarespace no joke

[1889.20 --> 1894.32]  even know what specific model we're talking about here it's not it's not it's not in here but it's

[1927.92 --> 1938.64]  topic yeah youtube has slashed the verification the verified user roster every once in a while youtube
[1938.64 --> 1943.76]  just comes in out of nowhere and is like and gives us a golden gift here's what you needed
[1943.76 --> 1950.88]  delivered perfectly to your door staff um yeah so i don't know do you want to be okay before we get
[1950.88 --> 1956.48]  into youtube canning verification badges for a bunch of users you have some updates on floatplane that you
[1956.48 --> 1961.60]  can share right you guys are on target to hit your we're on target target in 10 days we were talking
[1961.60 --> 1965.92]  about i want to know what's actually going to be live in 10 days you have to commit to the people it's
[1965.92 --> 1972.48]  less than 10 days it's 10 ish oh pretty sure that's how it works that's 10 yeah i don't know why i
[1972.48 --> 1978.32]  counted through them all i know how many days it is yeah uh so no one on the team has told me there
[1978.32 --> 1983.28]  would be a problem with anything yet speak now or forever hold this happens he's giving you this
[1983.28 --> 1990.32]  happens every time we have freaking problems every time but no one has said there's gonna be a problem
[1990.32 --> 1996.88]  this time so we're launching yearly payments which people have been asking for for freaking ever yeah
[1996.88 --> 2000.48]  because we used to have them back when it was running through the forum not that they actually
[2000.48 --> 2006.72]  worked correctly but we technically have them so we're launching yearly payments we're uh what
[2006.72 --> 2012.48]  else is even coming comment moderation which shouldn't matter to any of you guys but that's coming
[2013.60 --> 2016.24]  just saying um what's this four
[2018.96 --> 2019.36]  four
[2021.36 --> 2025.60]  one four 14 you're tallying things
[2025.60 --> 2030.96]  angled less than four
[2034.32 --> 2034.80]  four k
[2037.60 --> 2038.16]  four k's
[2041.76 --> 2044.96]  okay sorry i didn't get that the other part was supposed to be a line
[2046.16 --> 2051.84]  it's a k in american sign language a b c d e i don't know american language yeah don't worry about it
[2051.84 --> 2058.00]  what it kind of looks like a k but there's no line yeah whatever it's cool uh
[2059.20 --> 2065.28]  4k is coming okay so 4k is coming but it has to be like turned on by the creators and they're probably
[2065.28 --> 2071.12]  going to want to add additional plans that like cost more to turn that on so 4k is going to be ready
[2071.12 --> 2075.28]  platform wise right away but i don't know how long it's going to take until things actually like
[2075.28 --> 2081.52]  like come out on the platform at 4k and until you're able to actually like see it and stuff
[2082.32 --> 2090.32]  and then some back end stuff is being worked on and i think that's sort of it sweet yeah yeah uh
[2090.32 --> 2096.48]  apparently they backtracked the verification badge thing while we've been on stream that's amazing hold
[2096.48 --> 2102.40]  on a second how do you just do that like you already told people like you're not worthy and
[2102.40 --> 2108.96]  you're like wait no it's cool you totally are don't worry about it uh okay hold on youtube backtracks
[2108.96 --> 2114.56]  two hours ago this is great on taking badges away from creators after outcry okay so why don't we start
[2114.56 --> 2122.80]  at the beginning um youtube is ticking off creators again um and i i had teased at the beginning of the
[2122.80 --> 2130.80]  stream no way that i actually know someone who had their um who had their their eligibility for
[2130.80 --> 2142.24]  their verification badge stripped stripped stripped away none other than our very own yeah you're still
[2142.24 --> 2150.08]  there you go i'm good now i think so none other than our very own and dear terran van heemert this
[2150.08 --> 2161.68]  is taran van heemert's badge verification removal notification email notification there you go that
[2161.68 --> 2169.12]  was sent to him by messenger pigeon don't scroll it by youtube don't scroll oh yeah no i won't
[2170.80 --> 2176.24]  informing him that they're updating the eligibility criteria for channel verification on youtube
[2176.24 --> 2182.24]  unfortunately with these changes your channel no longer meets the criteria to be verified it used
[2182.24 --> 2186.40]  to be that anything over i think a hundred thousand subscribers could be verified we realize this
[2186.40 --> 2190.72]  might be disappointing but we believe these updates will make channel verification more consistent
[2190.72 --> 2195.44]  for users and creators across youtube please keep reading to learn more about the changes and what
[2195.44 --> 2201.28]  you can do what's changing youtube will now proactively verify channels instead of accepting requests
[2201.28 --> 2205.84]  for verification badges we aim to verify channels that represent a well-known or highly searched creator
[2205.84 --> 2209.44]  artist public figure or company with the clear name to differentiate themselves from other channels
[2209.44 --> 2217.20]  with a similar name and you basically are a nobody so channels are typically verified if they have a large
[2217.20 --> 2220.64]  audience and community on youtube are widely recognized outside of youtube or have a strong presence
[2220.64 --> 2224.80]  online or have a channel name that could be confused with other channels on youtube the goal is to help
[2224.80 --> 2229.68]  channels avoid impersonation help viewers understand if the channel or the official presence is the
[2229.68 --> 2234.40]  official presence of the creator celebrity or brand that it represents it does not represent endorsements
[2234.40 --> 2240.48]  or awards from youtube so what this means is you can go f yourself basically you're okay you can't
[2240.48 --> 2244.80]  appeal it you could appeal it that was a thing they offered i want to re-air some garbage here for a
[2244.80 --> 2250.16]  second i'm not verified on twitter which i don't actually really care about i'm not verified that much i know
[2250.16 --> 2255.76]  yeah the thing that really pisses me off about it yes is there is an account do you know about this
[2255.76 --> 2262.40]  there's an account that has my exact name just one of the letters is alpha coded yeah and i don't know
[2262.40 --> 2270.00]  which one it is i don't remember so it looks just like me it is a bot so it dynamically changes its cover
[2270.00 --> 2276.72]  photo and avatar photo to whatever i set mine to and it copies every single tweet i make and then
[2276.72 --> 2285.28]  randomly inserts racist ones and it follows everyone that i follow yeah so they get notifications saying this
[2285.28 --> 2292.24]  person just followed you and then they check it out and it's not me yeah luckily a non-insignificant
[2292.24 --> 2298.40]  amount of them have been like this doesn't seem right and have figured it out which is great but
[2298.40 --> 2305.68]  like what you're not a white supremacist i mean uh what what fired frankly i'm disappointed
[2307.52 --> 2311.76]  i thought we had this thing you look like a white supremacist i just it's just so but like
[2311.76 --> 2317.84]  they i told twitter that and they were like like this is the whole reason why verification exists
[2317.84 --> 2322.48]  yeah and it's important and it should be used so we're not saying twitter's system is correct no
[2323.28 --> 2328.08]  um but this isn't the right response probably isn't the right way to go about it ant venom lost his he
[2328.08 --> 2332.16]  has like over three million subscribers so basically they just determined he like
[2332.16 --> 2339.76]  like doesn't matter well they were like minecraft became less popular so screw you i guess you've
[2339.76 --> 2346.80]  had like toys in stores but nah i mean isn't minecraft popular again it is it's booming yet again i mean
[2346.80 --> 2352.72]  here i'm gonna creep him just because i'm like curious and stuff this is like this is basically what
[2352.72 --> 2359.92]  we all do on the content creation side we just like creep each other on social blade so uh subscribers for
[2359.92 --> 2367.44]  the last 30 days he's growing yeah he's actually he's growing monthly gained video views oh wow yeah
[2367.44 --> 2371.84]  he's growing because minecraft is because minecraft's back and i mean he made a video a long time ago
[2371.84 --> 2376.00]  being like why i'm still gonna make minecraft videos and he's just like i just really like minecraft
[2376.00 --> 2380.64]  so he's like the minecraft guy because a lot of people bailed on minecraft when it started becoming
[2380.64 --> 2387.44]  less popular but he stuck around so yeah he's he like rode that out for like years still
[2387.44 --> 2394.56]  no i mean rode out that dip oh yeah there was a years long dip in minecraft popularity like he
[2395.20 --> 2403.52]  struggled yeah but he's growing good on you and then they took it away from him anyways um anyway uh
[2403.52 --> 2411.12]  they took away um lots lots of people twitter's just covered in it right now so basically okay so epos
[2411.12 --> 2420.16]  yeah basically what i think youtube kind of missed here is that the verification tick is like um it's
[2420.16 --> 2426.40]  like a it's badge of honor it's kind of like getting a 100 000 subscriber plaque or or whatever
[2426.40 --> 2435.36]  else it's not necessarily from a creator standpoint it's not necessarily about um you know making i mean
[2435.36 --> 2440.08]  there is a practical component to it like luke said with that twitter bot that's yeah that spams like
[2440.08 --> 2445.68]  racist stuff yeah um so there's a practical component to it but there's also just like a a
[2445.68 --> 2454.24]  pride component to it and there's really no reason to not verify someone because i think that the name
[2454.24 --> 2462.56]  of it is right in there verified that's all it is there's no reason to not verify a creator it doesn't
[2462.56 --> 2469.28]  say unless they aren't who they say they are it doesn't say endorsed by yeah it just says verified yes
[2469.28 --> 2476.00]  this is the actual ant venom or yes this is the actual taren van heemert so if you you know you
[2476.00 --> 2482.32]  can be a bad person and have a passport yeah exactly like it's not it's not the country being like this
[2482.32 --> 2492.56]  person is fantastic i mean taren has 56 000 followers on twitter which maybe isn't a big deal in 2019 from
[2492.56 --> 2496.88]  youtube's perspective with their 2 billion unique users every month or whatever it is now
[2496.88 --> 2507.28]  um but that's enough that literally thousands of people could be confused if there was a taren van
[2507.28 --> 2514.32]  heemert on youtube and it was not the same one as the taren van heemert on twitter yeah and there was
[2514.32 --> 2521.76]  some kind of strangeness like oh this taren van heemert doesn't like macros what they hate macros it's so
[2521.76 --> 2528.24]  weird and like it's not it's not that hard either like it's the same it's the same tags and everything
[2528.24 --> 2533.28]  it says where he works well i'm sure people can spoof things you can buy followers and stuff it could
[2533.28 --> 2542.00]  be hard if they get it wrong i do see how them saying it's verified is kind of putting their seal of
[2542.00 --> 2547.60]  yes we verified it on it have you ever heard of that that's the other well i don't know just because i
[2547.60 --> 2552.64]  haven't heard of it doesn't mean it's not a problem it's true so there was an unlisted channel that was
[2552.64 --> 2560.96]  buying um fake ads on youtube uh promoting like an iphone giveaway or something using my face in their
[2560.96 --> 2566.96]  thumbnail but because the channel and the videos were unlisted that the ad campaign was linked to
[2567.76 --> 2573.60]  it was not immediately obvious to youtube's team that this was happening so it was only actually thanks
[2573.60 --> 2578.80]  to one of our very helpful users out there thank you who tweeted me a video id that i could forward
[2578.80 --> 2583.68]  to them that i was able to find it and report it to them they had the channel shut down and now
[2583.68 --> 2589.36]  they're gonna find it well they couldn't find it because i didn't they couldn't use their content id
[2589.36 --> 2596.96]  system to find your face on purchased advertisements on a thumbnail like just because they have like
[2596.96 --> 2602.64]  content id and then like but it was purchased ads and it was just in the thumb and then like content
[2602.64 --> 2609.68]  analysis for like what type of content it is or like content classification for what type of user
[2609.68 --> 2613.68]  it might be good for these are all completely disconnected they only use you in the thumbnail
[2613.68 --> 2617.92]  and it was an app i didn't watch the video i was almost it was only sent to me but yes apparently they
[2617.92 --> 2625.28]  just used me in the thumbnail they used me holding up an iphone as the thumbnail for like the the uh the
[2625.28 --> 2630.32]  banner or something anyway the point is it was kind of difficult to track down unless they were actually
[2630.32 --> 2635.84]  served it and actually clicked it and got a video id um so thanks to one of our users who brought that
[2635.84 --> 2641.76]  to my attention and they're working on improving their systems i i just mean just because nobody ever
[2641.76 --> 2646.00]  heard of something like that happening doesn't mean it wasn't a problem i don't fully see how that's
[2646.00 --> 2651.84]  related i just mean just because you never heard i agree yeah the concept yeah i don't really understand
[2651.84 --> 2656.72]  how the story works in there oh well the story is just that here's the thing that happened that you
[2656.72 --> 2661.52]  wouldn't have heard about no one would have heard about so in much the same way there could have
[2661.52 --> 2667.04]  been a situation where youtube verified someone by accident because they had a lot of subscribers
[2667.04 --> 2673.68]  and then that turned out to be spam or fake or like did the unlisted channel have a lot of subscribers
[2673.68 --> 2679.52]  what no no that doesn't matter that's not the point the point is that something yeah i'm sure it could be
[2679.52 --> 2683.76]  because you could buy followers on like any platform sure yeah so just because you didn't hear about it
[2683.76 --> 2688.88]  doesn't mean it wasn't a problem and the point of my story was that youtube will deal with weird edge
[2688.88 --> 2694.96]  cases that you wouldn't even think on on their side the weird edge cases are happening all the time
[2694.96 --> 2701.84]  because yeah exactly so they might see a lot of weird edge cases around these verified badges that have
[2701.84 --> 2708.24]  caused enough problems that they went this isn't worth it we can't deal with this anymore i think what
[2708.24 --> 2715.04]  they should maybe do in that case is just maybe increase the barrier to become verified not
[2715.04 --> 2718.72]  necessarily in terms of you need this many subs or whatever but like make the process just a little
[2718.72 --> 2723.36]  bit more difficult a little bit more involved but then don't make it impossible don't make it twitter
[2725.04 --> 2729.76]  or as far as i've heard it's like one person and as far as i can tell they're just super biased
[2731.20 --> 2735.52]  because they're like the the accounts that get verified and the accounts that don't get verified are just
[2735.52 --> 2743.20]  i've seen verified accounts of just like absolute nobodies on like the local like morning news thing
[2743.20 --> 2749.20]  with like 3 000 followers i've seen once they're not yeah they're not trying to be a public figure
[2749.20 --> 2753.60]  at all yeah and they have a verified badge i've had people send me ones where it's like they have
[2753.60 --> 2760.64]  like 40 followers which like that's totally fine but the point they're not trying to do anything
[2760.64 --> 2770.40]  yeah what who cares and if them why not these other people yeah i'm pretty sure i still don't have one
[2770.40 --> 2777.92]  on my personal twitter i don't think linus tech does yeah and that took forever yeah that took a really
[2777.92 --> 2783.20]  long time yeah no yeah my personal one doesn't have it maybe they don't like my my profile
[2783.20 --> 2795.12]  linus cat tips now features uh editing so i heard i got i got adobe rush um because i have creative
[2795.12 --> 2800.64]  cloud anyway i might as well use at least one program in the entire suite so it's actually not
[2800.64 --> 2806.32]  bad and with the stylus on the note all of a sudden i have a reason to care about my stylus to be
[2806.32 --> 2812.80]  anything other than a selfie remote shutter um so that's fantastic that's cool it actually was pretty
[2812.80 --> 2817.44]  easy to do like just just basic stuff just adding a title here and there and chopping up clips and
[2817.44 --> 2822.72]  stuff i have the most epic video that i'm going to be uploading on the cat tips channel in the next
[2822.72 --> 2828.24]  little bit maybe they won't like it because your name is still that very old very dead meme yeah i
[2828.24 --> 2836.80]  plan to keep it like that for quite some time ivan's hilarious uh my wife she's so funny because she's
[2836.80 --> 2842.48]  always like why do you do these things why do you behave in this way because she was like isn't that kind
[2842.48 --> 2849.44]  of like past now i'm like yeah she's like shouldn't you change it like no no she's like but it's not
[2849.44 --> 2855.52]  funny i'm like yeah that's what's funny about it she's like can you please just not i thought it's
[2855.52 --> 2864.16]  funny for a while can you just not like when when when tim apple is long forgotten when that when that
[2864.16 --> 2870.88]  is when when you know trump is no longer president even when it's just completely dead that will still be
[2870.88 --> 2876.48]  my username and to the vast majority of people who've completely forgotten everything about it
[2877.20 --> 2884.48]  it'll just make no sense and like probably no one's gonna mention it because like they don't want to
[2885.12 --> 2890.00]  they don't want to seem like maybe this is just something really new and i don't know about it yet
[2890.00 --> 2895.76]  yeah that's like my favorite my favorite my favorite kind of humor all right check check this out check
[2895.76 --> 2897.60]  this out no one else gets to see this no
[2902.88 --> 2903.84]  what the heck
[2907.52 --> 2913.04]  that's really cute and i just really don't understand cats are so foreign to me cats are so ridiculous
[2913.04 --> 2919.52]  they're just like the dumbest animals ever um here's something to enjoy while i introduce our next topic
[2919.52 --> 2924.80]  um that one's gonna go up probably after the other one all right what else we got here
[2927.68 --> 2934.72]  facebook to create an independent oversight board uh so facebook has unveiled its plan to create an
[2934.72 --> 2940.40]  independent oversight board to make decisions over how the network is moderated uh the panel will have
[2940.40 --> 2946.40]  the power to override decisions that facebook makes over contentious material and influence new policy
[2946.40 --> 2952.00]  the panel will hear its first cases in 2020 and their decisions will be made public the idea dubbed
[2953.92 --> 2955.76]  the facebook supreme court
[2958.32 --> 2962.72]  at this point should they just should they just say should they just say it out right
[2963.92 --> 2969.36]  we're basically as influential as a country let's just become a country yeah um
[2970.16 --> 2975.44]  we'll eventually be composed of 40 people around the world but we'll launch with 11 members and the names
[2975.44 --> 2981.20]  of those appointed will be made public uh experts have questioned this is great i love this the board's
[2981.20 --> 2988.24]  independence as well as the motivation behind this move um this this is a great quote the only vote
[2988.24 --> 2994.00]  that really counts is the majority shareholder mark zuckerberg uh the board will be paid via a trust
[2994.00 --> 3002.08]  setup and funded by facebook up front so facebook is basically creating i mean this is this is government
[3002.08 --> 3009.68]  level stuff the government appointing its own ethics watchdog is exactly the same as facebook appointing
[3009.68 --> 3017.12]  its own ethics watchdog having someone who can veto anyways yeah this is just great well i like it i kind
[3017.12 --> 3022.80]  of think there's this whole massive game of chicken going on right now between the like the what do you
[3022.80 --> 3030.40]  call them the fang fang am companies or something it's like facebook apple netflix google microsoft
[3032.48 --> 3039.36]  amazon yeah okay i said it slightly wrong fangum fangum whatever um i think there's a giant game of chicken going on
[3039.84 --> 3044.24]  for the first one to buy a country for the first one just be like screw it
[3044.24 --> 3053.12]  this is this is this is amazon land yeah this is amazon the amazon brought to you by amazon yeah
[3055.28 --> 3062.80]  no it's not burning okay which everyone forgot about so here's a fun topic would you move to google's
[3062.80 --> 3072.00]  country i don't know because it would be interesting because it would be probably the first time where like
[3072.00 --> 3079.84]  citizenship acquiring citizenship somewhere would probably be a lot easier i actually doubt it
[3081.76 --> 3087.60]  i think acquiring citizenship would be more difficult because i've okay you know this i've
[3087.60 --> 3093.20]  thought about this if i were to create a city yeah i still want you to make your city i've never aspired
[3093.20 --> 3099.76]  to a country if i were to make you should do it if i were to make a city i would be doing it to keep
[3099.76 --> 3103.52]  out idiots we've had this conversation where he has to tell me to shut up because i keep telling him
[3103.52 --> 3112.00]  to make a city i just think it'd be awesome but yeah no okay yeah yeah and i think but like with your
[3112.00 --> 3118.16]  thing you could probably like go take a test or like do something right there would be like an actionable
[3118.16 --> 3127.12]  item and then you could probably get in if you passed yeah i think a lot of the kinds of so okay
[3127.12 --> 3138.40]  that's okay my okay my point is my point is if i were them i wouldn't be creating a country to like
[3138.40 --> 3144.88]  make it easier no no no okay so i might have phrased that incorrectly what i mean is instead of like
[3144.88 --> 3150.32]  waiting in a queue forever yeah or the current like america to canada situation which is where like
[3150.32 --> 3156.56]  in a lot of situations you just can't yeah um there would be probably things that you could do
[3157.12 --> 3163.20]  or things that you could prove or whatever or what if there wasn't what if it was like verification
[3164.40 --> 3171.92]  what if there's one person just like they're super biased just like dialing the phone be like
[3171.92 --> 3181.36]  calling random people do you want a passport or or or or the google method what if they were like
[3181.36 --> 3189.52]  come on in actually you know what piss off you actually get out wait you're mad you can stay
[3190.96 --> 3196.72]  yeah yeah so oh you already sold all your stuff yeah yeah too bad
[3196.72 --> 3207.52]  okay so i want to show you something amazing um let me see if i can find the official form for it
[3207.52 --> 3213.92]  malta malta's hilarious if you just pay them like like i'm pretty sure they have i think i've heard
[3213.92 --> 3219.20]  about this officially on their website somewhere like the country of malta yeah malta citizenship by
[3219.20 --> 3222.48]  investment program there it is yeah hold on let me bring up your uh let me bring up but this
[3222.48 --> 3228.48]  isn't the actual this isn't the actual form anyways oh okay but there's just a form but no it's like
[3228.48 --> 3240.16]  oh you uh you give us a hundred grand and here's some passports what it's amazing oh but i can't find
[3240.16 --> 3248.48]  and to be clear the point of this whole thing is it gives you eu citizenship so it has an impact on it's
[3248.48 --> 3253.92]  far more impactful than just having a malta passport so there's a difference between like i want to be
[3253.92 --> 3261.20]  a resident for a year and like i want to be and i want to be like forever z's so it sounds like one
[3261.20 --> 3268.64]  year uh 90 day visa free travel to all european countries um one year residency in malta all that
[3268.64 --> 3274.08]  kind of stuff that's 24 000 euros but if you want like a passport and you want to be like there i think
[3274.08 --> 3281.20]  it's main applicants are required to make a 650 000 euro contribution okay so that's a lot then i
[3281.20 --> 3286.08]  mean to me i guess but it's like there's people that's nothing to some other amount of money for
[3286.08 --> 3292.48]  all of your dependents or whatever but you can just be like yeah whatever i'm an eu citizen yeah
[3292.48 --> 3300.08]  done yeah that's amazing um so like certain kind of versions of that kind of exist but it's purely
[3300.08 --> 3307.44]  financial right now okay i'm going to play devil's advocate now with our whole um you know facebook
[3307.44 --> 3314.56]  country okay here yeah what's the difference why would they want okay so yes you know the rules might
[3314.56 --> 3319.04]  be stupid and you might not have the privacy that you value
[3322.24 --> 3330.00]  and the rules are already stupid you already don't have oh that's what no i know yeah so i think evil
[3330.00 --> 3334.24]  online's like vision of the future has been awkwardly accurate for a long time we're just
[3334.24 --> 3339.60]  everything's corporations and you just like apply to a different corporate you are always it is
[3339.60 --> 3345.84]  impossible to not be in a corporation in that game and you just like apply to other corporations to
[3345.84 --> 3351.84]  transfer over and your employment history is public to everyone for your entire lifespan like i think
[3352.48 --> 3355.92]  from the minute you are born you are employed by a corporation
[3355.92 --> 3362.64]  and then you just bounce around from there on okay this leads me to another great topic um on the
[3362.64 --> 3371.68]  subject of your family being a corporation okay i'm gonna pitch you something um uh so you guys use slack
[3371.68 --> 3383.20]  yeah you use um shoot jira yeah um we use trello over here um um we've also played around with uh monday.com
[3383.20 --> 3387.92]  um okay oh god their advertisements that's probably why i get bombed by them all the time because you
[3387.92 --> 3393.84]  guys sort of look into it yeah well actually we did a sponsored thing with them oh it's like every
[3393.84 --> 3398.80]  second ad on youtube for me is monday.com yeah so this is sort of uh the kind of thing that hopefully
[3398.80 --> 3405.36]  nobody ever sees even though it's on wan shows so basically we took everything we we vetted it like
[3405.36 --> 3410.88]  we made sure that feature it was feature complete and it's like very similar to trello and then we
[3410.88 --> 3415.92]  decided okay we can endorse this it seems really great um so we did a piece and then we just
[3415.92 --> 3423.36]  substituted monday for trello in every way that we use trello already so the piece was very genuine
[3423.36 --> 3427.92]  in the sense that like yes that is exactly how we use our productivity enhancement tools as long as you
[3427.92 --> 3432.64]  guys verify and we verified that all the same tools are there yeah yeah as long as you verified
[3432.64 --> 3438.72]  monday.com so we're like yeah okay sure um and that episode that we made the video about the six
[3438.72 --> 3443.76]  hours to air they did use monday.com so it's like okay everything we said was true which is great
[3443.76 --> 3452.40]  anyway um so those tools there is a growing trend towards using those tools at home yes
[3454.16 --> 3461.84]  is that your answer do you i i want your answer first so so is yes your answer like yes i want jira for
[3461.84 --> 3468.40]  my home i want my shopping list in jira not jira okay but trello or monday jira's too heavy for that
[3468.40 --> 3475.68]  but i already do you already do okay i freaking knew it so i uh it hadn't even occurred to me until i was
[3475.68 --> 3480.72]  listening to some random podcast or reading an article i fell down like an internet black hole or
[3480.72 --> 3486.56]  something and like was clicking through things i was like huh so you create a you create a homework
[3486.56 --> 3493.28]  checklist uh or you create like a video games checklist of all the things that have to be done
[3493.28 --> 3500.40]  before you can play video games okay your kid uses their phone they submit i'd like a ticket effectively
[3500.40 --> 3505.76]  and you go sure you can say no or you can say yes complete the the homework checklist or the the video
[3505.76 --> 3510.16]  game checklist and so is your room clean is your bed made are your teeth brushed you could build
[3510.16 --> 3516.00]  automation tools that once all the cards are out of the once they're all in the completed
[3516.00 --> 3523.28]  column it like it like unlocks the internet or yeah yeah yeah totally you could do that yep um so
[3523.28 --> 3527.92]  you support this this notion because yvonne is thinking of switching our family over to trello
[3530.24 --> 3537.76]  shopping lists okay so i just use it personally no one else is on mine yeah mine is just for me okay
[3537.76 --> 3544.24]  and it's like kind of a mess but i understand the mess sure like it would be unacceptable okay then fine i
[3544.24 --> 3548.80]  want the more complete answer would you consider moving your girlfriend and your parents onto trello to
[3548.80 --> 3549.52]  interact with you
[3552.40 --> 3555.36]  um it would probably be really helpful
[3558.48 --> 3562.64]  i don't know i'm not necessarily against it family trello boards and stuff like that
[3562.64 --> 3566.72]  i think i think the thing is you got to stay away from especially if you're bringing it to this
[3566.72 --> 3572.64]  is getting into my manager head but if you're bringing it to like a family front yeah unless you
[3572.64 --> 3578.88]  have like a family where every single person in the family is an engineer you should probably use one
[3578.88 --> 3584.72]  of the lightweight ones sure like the mondays or the trellos out there i don't think you should use jira
[3585.28 --> 3590.48]  yeah just calm down jira's too much there's too much stuff going on it's very nice for what we do
[3591.12 --> 3594.88]  and like every time i've been like this is so annoying to work with because it is really freaking
[3594.88 --> 3598.80]  annoying to work with yeah i've been like okay we're gonna switch to this other thing so i tried
[3598.80 --> 3602.40]  out myself for a little while and then i try to like do the tasks that we're doing and i'm like no
[3603.12 --> 3607.44]  never mind we'll use jira but like yeah there's the right tool for the right job but i can see it
[3607.44 --> 3614.16]  making sense it's basically the old like what like pin board basically or the front of the fridge
[3614.16 --> 3619.12]  yep or whatever else yep just modernized and on everyone's phones absolutely yeah and so you just
[3619.12 --> 3623.92]  like double-sided tape a tablet to the front of your your fridge i have an old ipad too that would run
[3623.92 --> 3629.20]  trello just actually i don't know if the trello app requires ios 13 or 12 or whatever i'd have to
[3629.20 --> 3632.88]  check but that would be awesome so the shopping list is just like always there and everyone can
[3632.88 --> 3640.56]  update it from anywhere yeah yeah i think there's a value to it speaking of value lttstore.com now has
[3641.12 --> 3647.04]  a new shipping option oh what yeah so this is exciting we've actually got uh i'm just gonna bring it up i
[3647.04 --> 3656.32]  want those i know we're working on it um socks so lttstore.com stealth hoodie is in stock yeah
[3656.32 --> 3661.92]  uh the ram t-shirt has actually been super popular yeah um hard drive shirt and processor i think are
[3661.92 --> 3666.16]  the most popular items right now we've had really good feedback about the lanyard do you have one of
[3666.16 --> 3672.00]  the lanyards they're very nice it's hard for me to give up my valve lanyard oh yeah okay fine you can
[3672.00 --> 3678.24]  you can wrap valves as long as you want it's very old and gnarly yeah they're kind of butt heads in
[3678.24 --> 3684.48]  some ways i'm surprised they ever even gave out a lanyard i guess is but that's why i've kept it
[3684.48 --> 3689.68]  because like no one has them um but i didn't even think about the they're kind of butt heads now you
[3689.68 --> 3694.88]  guys can't see this but this is like super rugged they are i have mine on my desk because i'm waiting
[3694.88 --> 3700.40]  for this to fall in half again and then i'm gonna replace it so basically uh we had we can offer fedex
[3700.40 --> 3706.16]  shipping now in addition to ups and canada post and the benefits of fedex are not necessarily that
[3706.16 --> 3711.68]  you're gonna like immediately get way better pricing across the board i know that some regions
[3711.68 --> 3718.24]  do not have great pricing where is my freaking teams here in some places there we go some of them are
[3718.24 --> 3722.40]  better than the other ones too and some people know that but our rates should be at least marginally
[3722.40 --> 3727.68]  cheaper for europe asia and south america and the big thing is that the service should be much faster
[3727.68 --> 3734.32]  to those regions uh we have i had someone in europe contact me earlier this week being like it has
[3734.32 --> 3742.00]  been six weeks where the hell is my order with canada post i don't i don't understand what method of
[3742.00 --> 3750.64]  transportation can take weeks um i actually got some insight oh okay we'll come on around here so they
[3750.64 --> 3759.68]  can hear you come in the back um well phrasing so what they were telling me today is that oftentimes
[3759.68 --> 3766.08]  if let's say we're shipping something to italy for example um it won't go from richmond to italy it'll
[3766.08 --> 3772.08]  go from richmond to germany and then it'll get sorted in germany and then go to the uk because like they
[3772.08 --> 3776.88]  ship in these huge bulks when they're going to europe and they don't do it like country by country
[3776.88 --> 3781.92]  necessarily and that's why it takes so long so it'll only leave germany or wherever once they
[3781.92 --> 3788.24]  have like a full truck or whatever oh that makes and also once it's been sorted and once it's been
[3788.24 --> 3792.16]  like cleared into the right sorted and processed and in that pile and then in that truck and then
[3792.16 --> 3796.48]  wait for that truck to be full and then probably not directly to italy and then another big thing
[3796.48 --> 3802.32]  is um as far as i understand and you know we haven't done full testing on this yet um but all fedex
[3802.32 --> 3806.72]  shipments should be tracked oh so i know that's been sort of a frustration for some people so i'm
[3806.72 --> 3811.44]  really sorry but we're we're working on it hopefully these should be much better especially
[3811.44 --> 3817.60]  for europe customers the quoted like shipping times they have are like two to three business days to
[3817.60 --> 3823.60]  like germany and i'm like i don't know if that's accurate but um hopefully it's better than five weeks
[3823.60 --> 3826.56]  so one of my friends just got a 3d printer from shenzhen in two days
[3827.36 --> 3832.08]  free shipping that's insane was it like a 20 000 printer or something no
[3832.08 --> 3838.08]  oh no okay that that china subsidized international shipping man it's incredible
[3838.72 --> 3846.80]  yeah like you want to move to hong kong i'm kidding i mean honestly like not right now yeah
[3846.80 --> 3851.28]  the amount of stuff wrong place wrong time yeah not right now the amount of stuff that you can ship
[3851.28 --> 3858.24]  from hong kong for like you know 12 cents for like a physical package it's like what kind of nuts
[3858.24 --> 3864.72]  how does that make any sense you know what i mean uh anyway guys uh lttstore.com yeah helps us out a
[3864.72 --> 3872.24]  lot yeah and uh it's like good stuff yeah we're working on dhl yeah it's just not done yet yeah that'll
[3872.24 --> 3880.88]  be a lot of shipping options heck yeah yeah stuff all takes time um and we're doing our best basically
[3880.88 --> 3886.64]  we're we're learning a lot uh you know doing this ourselves versus using a service like teespring or
[3887.44 --> 3892.80]  district lines or you know any of the ones that we used in the past has been a huge learning curve
[3892.80 --> 3898.32]  for us but i think it's i think it's worth it um do we have any other big topics that we wanted to
[3898.32 --> 3907.76]  talk about today uh oh actually this one's interesting uh so huawei announced the mate 30 and the mate 30 pro
[3907.76 --> 3913.52]  in munich this week and confirmed that the devices will not have any google apps no google maps no
[3913.52 --> 3919.52]  chrome no play store uh so mate 30 users will have to search the web using the huawei browser and
[3919.52 --> 3924.64]  download apps using the huawei app gallery which apparently has around 45 000 apps compared to the
[3924.64 --> 3930.48]  play store's estimated 2.7 million i mean i'm sure you could just side load things uh the mate 30 pro
[3931.28 --> 3936.96]  mate 30 phones will be powered by open source android but will run emui 10 huawei's user interface that
[3936.96 --> 3941.60]  approximates google's android 10. that means why we will not will only be able to bring security
[3941.60 --> 3947.52]  updates to the mate 30 phones when those updates hit open source android um i mean they've never
[3947.52 --> 3951.52]  really been the fastest at security updates anyway so that probably won't be very different
[3951.52 --> 3957.76]  um yeah there's no way that i would even consider like it would even begin to consider buying an android
[3957.76 --> 3964.32]  phone that is not mainline android good luck remember remember that stupid watch how much it took me to
[3964.32 --> 3970.08]  get the play store on that stupid watch yeah oh yeah the the what was it called that stupid kick
[3970.08 --> 3975.60]  started kick farted thing yeah yeah i don't remember the name of it what was it called
[3977.20 --> 3982.80]  my brain's telling me it has something to do with a tree on the tip of my tongue why can i not remember
[3982.80 --> 3993.68]  uh i typoed that i like typed both of them kick farted playlist motion activated battery bank no that's
[3993.68 --> 4000.64]  the one wrist mounted smartphone neptune neptune pine that's why i thought tree neptune pine and i said
[4000.64 --> 4007.36]  that before it came up you did i won you did go linus uh but yeah i i was able to side load the whole
[4007.36 --> 4012.88]  play store onto that thing i don't know how viable side loading the entire play store is these days
[4012.88 --> 4016.80]  but you can probably side load the individual it's like a bad experience for anyone other than a great
[4016.80 --> 4022.08]  big nerd it was terrible yeah um all right we've got a couple other little things rockstar has a
[4022.08 --> 4027.68]  games launcher oh boy and like they already require you to use it if you want to play the game sweet
[4027.68 --> 4038.72]  um and the core i9 10 900x what a stupid name um appears on geekbench 4 someone has seemingly
[4038.72 --> 4047.60]  benchmarked it the unreleased processor sports the 10 000 series branding ah um so it's most likely one
[4047.60 --> 4053.84]  of intel's upcoming hedt parts based on their cascade lake micro architecture uh the rumored base clock and
[4053.84 --> 4060.72]  boost clock are four gigahertz and 4.6 gigahertz and intel claims that cascade lake x will bring
[4060.72 --> 4064.88]  double the performance per dollar so we might be getting some price drops scheduled to arrive next
[4064.88 --> 4072.56]  month and i guess that's pretty much it other than why is it called that some super chats oh one thing
[4072.56 --> 4079.68]  about the rockstar games launcher is in my opinion this is probably yeah okay so it's even in the notes
[4079.68 --> 4086.00]  this launch could be in preparation for a pc version of red dead redemption 2 and all of its various
[4086.00 --> 4092.00]  potential micro transactions bryant lewis says when is scrapyard wars dropping and do any people of color
[4092.00 --> 4098.96]  apply and get hired at lmg um so your first question i can answer that one pretty easily uh we are shooting
[4098.96 --> 4106.32]  scrapyard wars in two weeks which means that the episodes will come when they come as for whether any
[4106.32 --> 4112.80]  people of color apply and get hired at lmg the last time i checked um we have lots of people who are
[4112.80 --> 4118.40]  not white and as far as i know anything other than white is a color so i guess half of the founding
[4118.40 --> 4127.60]  members there's i guess there's that we're not white um also just saying as for more than half if you
[4127.60 --> 4133.04]  count yvonne of the family were you counting brandon i wasn't counting brandon oh okay okay brandon's tech
[4133.04 --> 4138.72]  okay okay what was he like week two well no okay so brandon's complicated because we didn't hire him
[4138.72 --> 4146.56]  until i think april or may okay but he actually volunteered for us on our first project which we
[4146.56 --> 4152.88]  completed it was a sponsored thing for corsair before the company formally started okay so he had
[4152.88 --> 4160.08]  i didn't know that for us okay before we ever paid him and before the company officially began on january
[4160.08 --> 4164.00]  first we didn't really have the money we did not have any money yeah yeah we had okay so i will
[4164.00 --> 4169.12]  count that i didn't know i forgot that part so that's why brandon is technically og even though
[4169.12 --> 4174.64]  he actually that makes sense that makes sense but at the same time yeah so then yeah majority was not
[4174.64 --> 4184.00]  white yeah so um as for our hiring practices we hire the most qualified candidate and isn't the majority
[4184.00 --> 4192.80]  still not white um i'm not sure honestly i don't give a shit it's not the point yeah i don't know
[4192.80 --> 4199.84]  either because it doesn't matter yeah um when people apply you know depending on what we're trying to do
[4200.40 --> 4207.20]  we hire whoever the person who seems like they can do it the best is yeah and speaking of which uh i don't
[4207.20 --> 4211.60]  know if i'm gonna be able to find it in time for it to be relevant but uh brandon appreciation day passed
[4211.60 --> 4218.72]  and i recognized that i was the only person who engaged in appreciating brandon on that day and
[4218.72 --> 4223.76]  i'm disappointed in the community so you guys should step up lordy yeah um
[4227.36 --> 4233.20]  all right oh wow steve a says please do a comparison with crt and fixed pixel displays
[4233.20 --> 4237.44]  i've heard that the moving resolution and fixed pixel displays falls apart compared to crt there was a
[4237.44 --> 4242.64]  there was an article that went up i think i digital foundry did a video digital foundry did a video
[4242.64 --> 4250.00]  and everyone on the planet is trying to come across like they came up with this out of nowhere
[4250.80 --> 4256.96]  and it's driving me nuts yeah like okay i i don't i'm not certain that digital foundry was the first
[4256.96 --> 4262.24]  i am not sure either i don't know where exactly this came from but whatever happened there what's up
[4262.24 --> 4269.36]  are you guys on you're not oh we're almost done you're still live we're still live yeah
[4269.36 --> 4275.76]  don't let me interrupt you okay thanks fella yeah but like the amount of tweets have gone i was thinking
[4275.76 --> 4282.16]  today yeah i think it would be so interesting if you were you no were you no you were not thinking
[4282.16 --> 4287.60]  about crt monitors today you just watched a video and are trying to pass the idea on to us so crts
[4287.60 --> 4293.92]  absolutely have a value and there are things that they do better than any modern display technology
[4293.92 --> 4299.68]  there's a reason that our arcade machine has a crt there's a reason that we have both a crt tv and a
[4299.68 --> 4304.88]  crt monitor over in the warehouse in case we happen to need one for a project yeah but there are lots
[4304.88 --> 4310.16]  of things that they don't do better and while they may have better motion resolution particularly for
[4310.16 --> 4317.84]  certain types of content they also flicker and i'm talking even at high refresh rates they flicker
[4317.84 --> 4325.20]  the eye fatigue like i don't miss that um so yeah no way in hell i would replace my daily driver monitors
[4325.20 --> 4332.00]  with a crt as not gonna happen as like a fun thing to play some super mario world yeah you've done it
[4332.00 --> 4340.40]  yes um yeah it's better yeah but like get real it's also very immersive are not coming back no
[4341.20 --> 4348.88]  like getting that sony one and messing around with i said they sell for way too much they sell for
[4348.88 --> 4353.12]  insane amounts of money but getting one of those and messing around would be fun there's no way i would
[4353.12 --> 4358.64]  replace my my setup with it and i think it weighs like a hundred pounds or something come on kepler the
[4358.64 --> 4362.96]  title is real it was just earlier in the stream it was the first topic that we did uh we are almost
[4362.96 --> 4367.12]  at the end of the stream now yeah all right uh i hope i hope digital foundry keeps making videos
[4367.12 --> 4372.16]  about it because it's very interesting to watch but i don't jesse says uh speaking of ufc do either of
[4372.16 --> 4381.44]  you watch it every once in a while uh nick has events and he invites me and i go and that's about it and
[4381.44 --> 4388.48]  i just go to socialize i am super not into it i've always had far more appreciation for finesse based
[4388.88 --> 4394.16]  athleticism than i do for brute force based athleticism with that said i was watching a
[4394.16 --> 4399.28]  trailer for some ufc event that maybe has passed now but was coming up at some point and i don't
[4399.28 --> 4404.72]  know who it was but he looked like he's probably like a lightweight or middleweight fighter who is
[4404.72 --> 4410.72]  phenomenally acrobatic that was pretty cool i guess i used to really like watching gsp i'm really
[4410.72 --> 4418.64]  really not into watching people get brain damaged um yeah and i you know ufc has has benefits over
[4418.64 --> 4423.84]  more traditional sports like boxing in that regard because the fact that you don't have gigantic pads
[4423.84 --> 4430.00]  on your fists means that your brain isn't getting shaken around quite so much but it's just not
[4430.00 --> 4433.68]  something that i personally derive pleasure from and i don't really enjoy watching bare knuckle to the
[4433.68 --> 4440.32]  head is like super bad for brain damage yes but compared to bouncy bounce 40 hits from oh no yeah yeah
[4440.32 --> 4446.08]  yeah okay okay i see where you're going with it yeah it's yeah yeah yeah watching gsp was really
[4446.08 --> 4450.24]  interesting because he was extremely technically good and he would just like dismantle people that
[4450.24 --> 4455.44]  was really cool uh johnny winter says linus last year you talked about some vessel to put between
[4455.44 --> 4459.28]  monitors so it made the monitors flow together what happened to that asus actually like tweeted about
[4459.28 --> 4464.88]  that recently i think that project is not actually dead oh wow lucas says getting jerked around by razer
[4464.88 --> 4470.56]  support after two dead new laptops in two years i know you all had a lot of failures too any contacts
[4470.56 --> 4476.64]  that you can share unfortunately the only contact i have there is my media contact i don't have any
[4476.64 --> 4482.88]  special sales or support contact um you can link them to me saying i'm very disappointed in them right
[4482.88 --> 4488.08]  now but that's really the best that i can do for you i'm not surprised either i can tell you that i do
[4488.08 --> 4493.84]  have a video coming on probably not switching or not sticking with the razor blade stealth that i selected
[4493.84 --> 4501.44]  recently so there's that nice uh rohit says please do a tech wiki on shunt modding and its benefit
[4503.28 --> 4503.92]  sorry what
[4506.80 --> 4515.12]  shunt modding first hit do not shunt mod your graphics card in all capital letters from lewis rosman with
[4515.12 --> 4523.28]  liquid metal oh well that would be stupid okay uh neat oh this okay
[4524.16 --> 4529.28]  so okay so you're just you're just shorting out connections on the graphics card pcb in order to
[4529.28 --> 4535.52]  get more voltage out of it um yeah that'd be kind of cool it's pretty niche though yeah
[4537.12 --> 4543.36]  yeah i'll consider it uh jesse says is your trademark ratchet driver a snap-on yes it is
[4543.36 --> 4551.04]  uh i have a pink one for you i own a pink one already um yeah it's uh it's my wife's actually
[4551.04 --> 4560.48]  uh dimitri says flow plane or float plane float like float like not sink uh ben says please talk
[4560.48 --> 4566.72]  about folding month 2019. i think that was even in here oh wait i think we talked about it on a
[4566.72 --> 4571.68]  previous wine show didn't we i thought that happened a few months back oh here we go uh there are some
[4571.68 --> 4575.92]  prizes that we're going to be giving away as well as some that the community has donated you can check it
[4575.92 --> 4583.12]  out on the ltt official folding month 2019 thread over on the forum i will go ahead and drop that in
[4583.12 --> 4589.92]  the i will not drop that in the chat i don't have the chat open uh that'll take me a minute but yes
[4589.92 --> 4595.60]  shout out to folding month 2019. yeah it's very active there's posts in that thread as of like now so
[4596.24 --> 4603.60]  uh burnsey says i am financially stupid so here's some money nice it's my birthday next month i want some
[4603.60 --> 4608.72]  ltt merch what would you recommend for my first purchase um if you are looking for
[4610.64 --> 4617.12]  oh hold on a second i really want to just oh man the sweater is like really nicely durable
[4618.00 --> 4621.60]  i mean all of it's really nicely durable but i feel like that sweater is going to hold up for a
[4621.60 --> 4625.76]  really long time stealth hoodie is great water bottle is great um the underwear are awesome but
[4625.76 --> 4630.00]  they're really expensive so it's kind of it kind of depends on your budget stealth hoodie is a really
[4630.00 --> 4634.64]  good place to start stealth hoodie stealth hoodie and like an elemental shirt or something like that
[4634.64 --> 4639.28]  i know they're not there now but they'll be back we're kind of considering bringing back elemental on
[4639.28 --> 4644.24]  an ongoing basis as something that we can just like beat the crap out of every once in a while
[4645.76 --> 4651.04]  it's just like yeah no one likes it but it's a good deal sure we probably won't do that yeah that's
[4651.04 --> 4656.24]  probably not the best um noah says is floatplane working on separation of ltd tech quick and tech
[4656.24 --> 4661.44]  link but under one subscription um so no they will be separate subscriptions at some point when i'm
[4661.44 --> 4669.44]  not lazy uh bubba bubba bubba demat 812 says hope you don't mind hillbilly humor for the content
[4669.44 --> 4674.72]  contest you announced yesterday oh we don't mind hillbilly humor uh robert says can i resell my red hat
[4674.72 --> 4680.72]  license with these new challenges then no no they're only they're only challenging steam right now they
[4680.72 --> 4685.12]  said they have the plan to challenge other things but i doubt they're gonna go after that
[4685.76 --> 4690.64]  uh tommy gun says hey linus you should really visit the developer of anno they're located in my hometown
[4690.64 --> 4696.00]  uh by the way it's late around here yeah because you're in germany all right then robert says when
[4696.00 --> 4700.88]  is the amd epic video coming very soon and there will be more than just one uh robert says remember
[4700.88 --> 4706.80]  area 51 you hear about the youtubers that got arrested no yeah they went in the day before and they
[4706.80 --> 4710.48]  got all their electronics so their camera equipment lights and a drone confiscated
[4710.48 --> 4716.32]  like for good they got uh fined 2200 each they actually got sentenced to a year in jail
[4716.32 --> 4720.56]  but they're foreign nationals so i think they worked at a deal where they could pay 2200 spend
[4720.56 --> 4725.36]  three days in jail and then i'm guessing they're never getting let into the u.s again the hell back
[4725.36 --> 4730.96]  out yeah they're foreign nationals why would you do that because no the memes i guess but like
[4731.52 --> 4736.48]  something that's always broken like broken my brain do not break the law in a different country
[4736.48 --> 4743.20]  like the people that go to like uh north korea and like steal posters but what are you doing
[4744.64 --> 4750.72]  what are you doing i get it you're an activist that's great find other ways but like there's
[4750.72 --> 4754.72]  people that like it's a really bad idea i don't know how they get them there but there's people that
[4754.72 --> 4763.28]  get usbs filled with like north american european stuff into north korea do that buy a whole bunch of
[4763.28 --> 4768.56]  usbs donate them to that yeah group that does that i don't know much about it but yeah their their
[4768.56 --> 4773.44]  posters are hilarious they'll go to different events and they just have like kim jong-un faces and you
[4773.44 --> 4778.96]  plug the usb into his mouth and then they just like and it just looks stupid and then they collect all
[4778.96 --> 4782.96]  the usbs at the end of the day and wipe them all and fill them with information and send them north
[4782.96 --> 4791.12]  korea really it's pretty interesting actually they have them at um like different conventions yeah i
[4791.12 --> 4798.00]  don't know uh okay scgaming have you taken a look at gog we actually did a collab with gog that we shot
[4798.00 --> 4804.24]  this week do you know about this uh i've heard vaguely we made the best gaming console as a pc so we
[4804.24 --> 4810.24]  built like a console sized pretty powerful computer okay um and we worked with gog because really the
[4810.24 --> 4815.36]  the point we're trying to make is that one of the big benefits of the pc is the library yeah and gog
[4815.36 --> 4822.80]  is such a great example of how deep and affordable the pc gaming library is and so uh gog generously
[4822.80 --> 4829.76]  contributed their 500 top selling games which was apparently a ton of work for them because they
[4829.76 --> 4836.24]  actually had to reach out to every developer to get the okay for this they gave them all to us to
[4836.24 --> 4842.24]  load onto this pc and we're going to give away the pc uh at the end of the video yeah so uh pretty sweet
[4842.24 --> 4847.36]  gog good one thing that i really like about gog is it's a platform that you can support that's a
[4847.36 --> 4853.92]  gaming platform that you don't have to feel at least marginally weird about uh so rowan says that
[4853.92 --> 4858.24]  reselling games could be a positive for valve if they allow the sale through their marketplace allowing
[4858.24 --> 4862.72]  them to double dip into the sale of the game they could also give some to the developer yeah that's
[4862.72 --> 4867.20]  probably where we're going to end up realistically gaming trouble says make sure you look at the cube
[4867.20 --> 4876.72]  world release for steam it's so big news i don't know what cube world is um
[4878.80 --> 4883.84]  captain pepper says i love my hdd and ram shirts but my fave is the tech linked masking tape shirt such a
[4883.84 --> 4887.92]  great story behind it any more limited edition products coming i mean those will only happen when they
[4887.92 --> 4891.76]  like when inspiration strikes we're not going to force it i don't think we should actually do it
[4891.76 --> 4896.96]  but someone mentioned the other day that we should do the green masking or green painters tape fpm logo
[4897.68 --> 4903.76]  as a shirt if you guys want to take on the burden of that inventory go for it we don't have anywhere to
[4903.76 --> 4914.16]  put it we don't have any inventory space okay let me see yeah uh steven says first super chat ever
[4914.16 --> 4918.32]  you guys rock please send support to ufd tech yeah we talked about that oh wow these were a while ago
[4918.96 --> 4923.92]  uh oh boy hey guys what phone can you recommend to someone who's off contract and paying for their
[4923.92 --> 4928.80]  device up front would like to shy away from financing uh really wow it really depends on your budget
[4928.80 --> 4934.64]  i mean samsung's a series is pretty good but they're still like pretty expensive um
[4936.88 --> 4940.32]  anything from oneplus is good but they're not that cheap anymore so that's tough
[4940.32 --> 4946.80]  pocophone f1 you can get your hands on one of those if it's got good band support in your area
[4946.80 --> 4952.96]  um it's still a very decent phone especially with the google camera mod uh kyle andrews hey guys
[4952.96 --> 4958.56]  what phone can you recommend someone who's off oh whoops jacob name another product you can buy
[4958.56 --> 4966.72]  and not resell in the world uh sure uh a thermal camera i'm serious yeah yeah you have to sign a
[4966.72 --> 4970.56]  whole thing that says you're like not a terrorist and it needs to stay in your possession and blah
[4970.56 --> 4978.16]  blah blah blah blah blah because it could be used for military applications uh digital movies um sure
[4978.16 --> 4984.16]  yeah but no they meant like that's the same thing effectively it's not a game okay that's true
[4984.72 --> 4989.36]  digital things are in their own category underwear i mean you can resell it but like
[4989.36 --> 4996.56]  it's like for all intents and purposes it's not it's consumable um living says how often do you
[4996.56 --> 5002.88]  run on raid parody checks um whenever they automatically run i mean they don't really uh
[5003.44 --> 5007.12]  just like fall out of parody i think he's wondering if you have like a schedule set up or
[5007.12 --> 5010.88]  something uh yeah it's included with unraid i think it's set to run every month by default
[5011.44 --> 5013.84]  but that i think that's what he oh once a month
[5013.84 --> 5020.80]  um yes sir how would you feel about having physical games on flash drives too expensive
[5021.36 --> 5028.32]  can't be done uh tommy gun to be mean many years we were told that digital distribution is all about
[5028.32 --> 5035.52]  anti-piracy and not about reselling so what would be the issue nah there's more to it than that uh
[5035.52 --> 5038.56]  charlie says please bring back the lan hoodie not happening
[5038.56 --> 5041.52]  oh
[5046.64 --> 5052.64]  interesting uh we actually are planning a video bobby on the lgc9 after the g-sync update
[5052.64 --> 5056.96]  apparently a pc connected to hdmi only does two channel pcm right now
[5057.60 --> 5063.68]  uh big deal if you use arc to a receiver why would you use arc to a receiver though why wouldn't you just
[5063.68 --> 5069.92]  go through your receiver it doesn't do does it do g-sync over hdmi how the hell does that work
[5069.92 --> 5073.84]  i actually i saw the i saw the headline but i wasn't sure how they were doing it oh interesting
[5073.84 --> 5078.56]  so it's funny that you bring that up because i have a video coming on asus's bfgd and i'm having
[5078.56 --> 5085.52]  a similar issue how do i get audio how do i get high resolution audio or excuse me high definition audio
[5085.52 --> 5091.44]  to uh like a surround or like a multi-channel speaker setup because you're going displayport from
[5091.44 --> 5098.00]  the computer to the to the display and then what optical audio is dead dead and buried like it
[5098.00 --> 5107.68]  doesn't do high definition audio so um all right get this hdmi out separately to the receiver oh god
[5108.48 --> 5115.60]  shut up and then duplicating my display and then i found this weird app on like
[5115.60 --> 5122.16]  github or something that uh allows you to lock your mouse to your primary display
[5122.96 --> 5129.60]  so you're effectively running a phantom cloned display that did seem to be getting multi-channel audio
[5130.40 --> 5135.68]  whoa i didn't fully know how you were going to get there but the second you said the additional
[5135.68 --> 5140.40]  cable it's just like oh no i know exactly what the destination is i'm not sure how the journey's
[5140.40 --> 5145.60]  going to come together uh we're not bringing back the wan hoodie anytime soon is it even like feasible
[5145.60 --> 5156.64]  to do that no yeah i didn't think so i think that's done uh bruce says uh love you and your
[5156.64 --> 5160.88]  annoying voice i've been spamming floatplane on every vid complaining about youtube slashing
[5160.88 --> 5167.84]  verification well they brought it back so um mitch says will it be possible for us floatplane peeps who
[5167.84 --> 5173.12]  were grandfathered to switch to yearly and still be considered grandfathered for ltt wow i have no
[5173.12 --> 5180.00]  idea that sounds really complicated i don't know if i want to promise anything there um i'm gonna bug
[5180.00 --> 5187.04]  you about this till it's real says zulmelb how long until i can buy a floatplane shirt i don't know
[5187.04 --> 5192.08]  i don't know uh daniel says can't wait for ltx 2020 so very introverted says buy dennis a coffee
[5192.08 --> 5198.24]  tennis doesn't need coffee dr don says uh what do you think of the while we made 30 okay we talked
[5198.24 --> 5202.40]  about that technically you supply coffee at work anyways simon says why didn't you guys use a
[5202.40 --> 5208.00]  thread ripper for your windows mac os build is there a specific reason uh yeah thread ripper is like
[5208.00 --> 5214.16]  not zen 2 right now thread ripper is not amazing performance in single threaded applications um
[5214.16 --> 5221.12]  um hey guys no secret laugh in live says l heart w i have no idea what you're talking about daniel says
[5221.12 --> 5227.04]  watching an epic phone watching epic phone watching stream okay robert says if google's healthcare is
[5227.04 --> 5232.64]  more affordable than the u.s then yes i'd move to google i'd love it if they called the country google
[5234.24 --> 5237.12]  uh waldemar says the court of public opinion is becoming real
[5237.92 --> 5243.12]  corey says it's been the worst week of my life google country oh wow um they've google earth

[5257.04 --> 5263.92]  fee on delivery um yeah probably but i think that might just be taxes and import duty and i'm pretty
[5263.92 --> 5269.52]  sure you're gonna get nailed with that regardless especially if you're in like a vat country um
[5270.24 --> 5275.12]  oh my goodness there are so many super chats today please guys do not send any more
[5276.72 --> 5280.32]  uh i i can't do all of the rest of them um
[5282.48 --> 5290.80]  okay i already did that one mr devin wright says feedback on in video merchant content uh in merch
[5290.80 --> 5298.48]  callouts it's become excessive um yeah we know we're trying to dial back how long they take so at least it's
[5298.48 --> 5303.20]  just like a quick thing adam yes we intend to review the one plus tv as soon as we can get it
[5304.00 --> 5311.52]  um okay what happened to the youtube black hole pc linus mentioned a while ago says default switched
[5311.52 --> 5316.72]  a while ago that was ages ago it's like three years ago years many years um it ended up being
[5316.72 --> 5321.52]  very complicated do you remember why it was complicated uh they didn't want us to do it or
[5321.52 --> 5325.52]  something didn't they i don't remember no i don't think because we were we were no but we were gonna be
[5325.52 --> 5331.52]  uh no it's against their terms though yeah i don't think that was why we didn't do it we were
[5331.52 --> 5335.84]  concerned for that reason maybe nick was concerned i didn't care i'm pretty sure nick was quite
[5335.84 --> 5344.16]  concerned all right then yeah um okay vincent says badminton merch when uh no time soon
[5344.72 --> 5349.44]  although i do want to do an athletic shirt so that's that'll be okay so we'll do it
[5349.44 --> 5355.60]  i'm not gonna do like a racket or anything that would be crazy that's probably good all right
[5357.20 --> 5357.52]  uh
[5359.76 --> 5365.28]  although i bet you oh if you did a fairly limited run of rackets just enough that you like didn't lose
[5365.28 --> 5371.04]  any money off it and then sold them on location at ltx so you didn't have to try to ship them or
[5371.04 --> 5375.84]  anything they wouldn't that you guys would sell it would be hard to get it right i'm really picky and i
[5375.84 --> 5382.56]  wouldn't i wouldn't sell anything that i wouldn't use so it's tough okay um vita kyle last vita kites
