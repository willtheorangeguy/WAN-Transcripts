[2019-04-07T01:13:14Z] Video: Intel is SERIOUSLY Threatening NVIDIA - WAN Show April 5, 2019 
Love the team, and you guys gotta do your thing, but I'm a bit disappointed that the average WAN show lately has been well over 50% LTT talking about themselves (be it LTT, floatplane, LTX),
 as opposed to long form commentary on tech news. I use the timestamps to skip past the non tech news stuff and that leaves a pretty small amount of content to view, compared to how things used to be. Best of luck with the new format and approach, but I personally just don't get excited about this new WAN show anymore.
