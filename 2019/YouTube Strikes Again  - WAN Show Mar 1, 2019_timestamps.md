im very surprised that youtube doesnt have restricted comments yet. similar to twitch, they could have subscriber comment mode.. so that you can only comment if you have been subbed for like 2 weeks or so. that would keep the random spam away and would limit the incomming comments for videos that blow up outside the regular audience. also, auto moderation would be nice. just let people put in banphrases that automatically remove comments that include them. Let people turn off links and timestamps in their comments. Limit the amount of comments a single person can leave... it could be soo easy to make the comment section better. these are just ideas that i pulled out of my ass in 1 minute... i feel like youtube could come up with some great tools if they actually tried.
