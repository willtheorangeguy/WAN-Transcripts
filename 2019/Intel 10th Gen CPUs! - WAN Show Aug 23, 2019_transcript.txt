[0.00 --> 10.48]  start start and we're live y'all already saw the intro right yeah yeah it sounds good actually i
[10.48 --> 15.34]  guess we have to run this again welcome to the show everything's working perfectly we're totally
[15.34 --> 20.34]  on time i've got wendell here from level one text who's just laughing at all of the failures
[20.34 --> 26.50]  um and we've got some great news including intel's 10th generation desktop cpus hitting
[26.50 --> 31.76]  the market someday i don't know whatever i don't know whatever we'll talk about why that's a
[31.76 --> 36.46]  later on uh study shows that americans are waiting three years to replace phones now
[36.46 --> 41.98]  which is considerably longer than before walmart is suing tesla over defective solar panels lighting
[41.98 --> 45.94]  on fire and other crazy stuff stay tuned for more rolling the intro
[45.94 --> 67.90]  display
[67.90 --> 70.34]  all right pia
[70.34 --> 76.62]  and madrinas thank you very much for sponsoring the show i'm gonna move that back up and jump
[76.62 --> 82.44]  back here okay i think it's working now i think we're going to youtube we're definitely going to
[82.44 --> 87.60]  floatplane and we're definitely going to twitch youtube sometimes takes a second to like let me
[87.60 --> 93.28]  check that it's actually live youtube's gonna buffer for about two minutes and then it's gonna kick on
[93.28 --> 99.02]  and start from the beginning yeah yeah absolutely okay well i'm not going to worry about that this
[99.02 --> 103.60]  second our first topic which we're going to try to get the title topic out of the way first because
[103.60 --> 107.52]  i feel like that's good form we've been doing that for a little while now people seem to appreciate it
[107.52 --> 115.20]  news of intel's 10th gen desktop cpus uh sticking with 14 nanometer process it's going to be uh code
[115.20 --> 120.32]  named comet lake s which i think has been kind of leaked around a little bit already it's going to be
[120.32 --> 127.28]  up to 10 physical cores up from eight on the current gen flagship i9 9900k which i'm happy i'm never going
[127.28 --> 133.44]  to have to stay again um and it looks like you might need an upgrade to your motherboard because
[133.44 --> 139.28]  it's going to need more power more and more tdp increasing to around 125 watts on the top end
[139.84 --> 148.96]  um it's expected to be called lga 1200 what do you think it's another new socket already so many sockets
[148.96 --> 158.48]  we've had so many sockets like i mean come on it's just uh uh come on yeah i think like it's getting
[158.48 --> 164.24]  to the point where if you lined up on a wall all of your like intel sockets from the beginning just
[164.24 --> 168.56]  the amount that you would have would actually be ridiculous if you tried to have like a collection
[168.56 --> 172.72]  of all of them like there was a there were chinese boards that you could get that would work with like
[172.72 --> 177.52]  that they were like z 170 and it worked fine with like the 9700k maybe i'm misremembering
[179.12 --> 184.08]  i yeah there's there's some there's some there's been some funky stuff like that
[184.08 --> 189.12]  a few separate times actually i i enjoy those types of things my favorite stuff is when they
[189.12 --> 192.56]  do that kind of stuff i know it's not the exact same thing but when they do that kind of stuff with
[192.56 --> 197.44]  graphics cards where they're like oh it's not supposed to work this way or like ah here's two
[197.44 --> 201.12]  different two totally different graphics cards we're gonna sell them to you at totally different price
[201.12 --> 206.72]  points and people are like i can just i can just make the lower end one better don't worry about it
[206.72 --> 212.40]  i don't know the the latest leaks adding the latest like desktop 10 core like mainstream leaks
[213.04 --> 218.48]  on to like all of the other 10 core leaks plus the actual like 10 core launches every like they're
[218.48 --> 224.56]  calling everything 10th gen but like there's two different laptop parts and then we've got the high-end
[224.56 --> 231.36]  desktop stuff coming probably before this stuff in 2020 and the high-end desktop stuff is going to be
[231.36 --> 237.04]  on x299 so we'll probably keep that socket maybe at least that was the update a couple of days ago
[237.04 --> 242.96]  that's linked in the the bottom of the the tom's hardware article but like these are all different
[242.96 --> 248.88]  like it's a big deal to port the memory controller the lp ddr4x memory controller like it's a big deal to
[248.88 --> 254.08]  port that from the newer process to the older process cpus and intel is telling their investors
[254.08 --> 260.16]  like no no we're shipping 10 you know uh you know the 10th generation mobile cpus on the new process
[260.16 --> 263.52]  everything is fine and then stuff like this comes out and it's like well those aren't going to be on
[263.52 --> 272.88]  the new process why why it doesn't make any sense come on yeah the tom's article is actually pretty good i
[272.88 --> 277.04]  like that they laid everything out here as well going all the way back to sky lake that was pretty nice
[277.04 --> 283.92]  so you can see from sky lake kaby lake coffee lake coffee lake refresh and comet lake yeah love that
[283.92 --> 290.16]  little refresh in there and then it's been kind of interesting how max tdp on this side has been going
[290.16 --> 298.32]  up consistently yeah well and it's also all lies because like yeah nobody is using a 9900k at
[298.32 --> 305.68]  completely stock settings i mean that's just crazy why why it's it's it's does it hurt you when people get
[305.68 --> 309.92]  unlock processors and then don't do anything with them i mean it's to the point where like all the
[309.92 --> 315.92]  motherboard manufacturers have it as like one option like multi-core enhancement like you just
[315.92 --> 322.16]  turn that on and you get free performance like why would you not do that yeah and it's like actually
[322.16 --> 326.00]  pretty good these days i remember when they first started doing those auto overclocking things some of
[326.00 --> 331.84]  them were kind of junk but now they're actually quite decent at overclocking your cpu so it's like
[331.84 --> 337.84]  like yeah doing it manual is more fun but if you don't want to press press the button hooray
[338.72 --> 343.44]  really really simple really really simple performance and that's what they're they're
[343.44 --> 348.48]  they're doing it for you at the factory now too with the 9900ks which should be out in a couple of
[348.48 --> 356.00]  months uh so that'll be fun five gigahertz all core out of the box dang that's actually pretty crazy i know
[356.00 --> 362.64]  um i i think the the the hardest sell here right now is that intel is not winning like anything in
[362.64 --> 370.08]  the pr realm at the moment uh everybody's rah rah amd as far as i can really tell it's it's it's hard
[370.08 --> 377.76]  for intel to stay on their feet pr wise in the in the cpu section at this exact point in time so coming
[377.76 --> 381.36]  out and telling everyone that they're gonna have to upgrade their motherboards is a little scary i realize
[381.36 --> 387.36]  that they they they can't also not do that because to push this they apparently need more tdp but like
[388.96 --> 397.76]  ah yeah you get wi-fi six support though well i'm kind of excited for the x299 stuff which is
[397.76 --> 402.88]  probably going to come out sooner because you know you may have up to 48 pcie lanes for the leak from
[402.88 --> 408.48]  that and that kind of stuff that that may be exciting but here's like there's a there's more than just
[408.48 --> 412.64]  getting a new motherboard that's disappointing and one of those things is like memory support so
[412.64 --> 419.12]  like the times of hardware article is like oh the new x299 cpus that are 10th gen really i mean are
[419.12 --> 424.72]  they really 10th gen that are 10th gen uh are going to support 256 gigs of memory up from 128 and it's
[424.72 --> 433.20]  like well not so fast there tom it's we're just now getting memory densities that will support 256 gigs like
[433.20 --> 440.24]  technically threadripper will only do 128 gigs but then oh wait 32 gig dims yeah now they're 256 gigs
[440.24 --> 444.96]  it's fine there now too and it's not that the hardware changed it was always there it's just
[444.96 --> 452.24]  nobody was making the dims to do that but if you had like a 79 like a 79 60x you could use registered
[452.24 --> 458.24]  memory with those like 512 gigabytes of memory was fine and then intel got wind of people actually using
[458.24 --> 462.24]  registered memory on those cpu i mean ecc didn't work but you could still use it you still got the
[462.24 --> 467.20]  capacity yeah they all got wind of people doing that and they just they just turned it off and
[467.20 --> 471.92]  they're like no and it's always been like that and it's like no no really i'm i'm running 512 gigs of
[471.92 --> 479.44]  memory on this on this x99 cpu intel that is what you need to stop doing yeah so on these new processors
[479.44 --> 486.32]  if somebody wants to run registered memory let them what does it hurt what does it hurt but but our
[486.32 --> 492.88]  our product differentiation wendell no we need another segment we need to slice the pie you know
[492.88 --> 498.24]  just this little tiny it's like or you're gonna have to buy xeon it's like no or the new mac pro it's
[498.24 --> 503.28]  like you gotta buy the new mac you want 64 pcie lanes from xeon you gotta buy the mac pro because
[503.28 --> 509.20]  otherwise you're only gonna get like 48. just put your put your mac pro in your server
[509.20 --> 515.92]  chassis don't worry about it it's fine rack mount it are you interested in those at all
[517.44 --> 522.00]  no i'm suspecting no yeah i didn't think so i just thought you know i thought i'd ask
[522.56 --> 528.80]  oh it is really it is really interesting that they didn't change the socket so um i think they used the
[528.80 --> 533.52]  quick path lanes like apple i think was leaning on intel like i don't know there's no this is
[533.52 --> 538.56]  completely unsubstantiated but it looked like intel was kind of leaning on apple or apple was leaning on
[538.56 --> 544.32]  intel to have 64 pcie lanes because if you look at the way the pcie layout is in the new mac it's
[544.32 --> 551.84]  actually kind of interesting and you know the same server 3647 socket you know where are you gonna get
[551.84 --> 557.52]  the pins for that i think that they reuse the quick path like what you would normally have for the
[557.52 --> 562.88]  interconnect for a two socket system i think they recycled those into pcie lanes because there's
[562.88 --> 570.00]  legit only enough pins there for 48 pcie lanes so they got another you know a few lanes to take it
[570.00 --> 578.00]  up to 64 pcie lanes for intel not having the capability to do quick pack okay that's actually pretty
[578.00 --> 585.84]  interesting i could be wrong about that but that's my suspicion and yeah yeah it's really weird too
[585.84 --> 591.68]  because like these leaks say that the new high-end desktop processors are still going to be x299 but i
[591.68 --> 595.60]  figured they would just go ahead i mean if they're doing the apple stuff they just go ahead and do 3647
[595.60 --> 600.00]  on the desktop unless they're having massive production problems and then it's like well
[600.00 --> 606.40]  maybe we shouldn't do that which i i think they kind of are so that's not what they tell shareholders
[607.04 --> 615.36]  that's true that's fair yeah who really knows though um okay i want your thoughts on this one too and we
[615.36 --> 620.24]  might as well go over this subject we're we're changing topics we're going to talk about uh study shows that
[620.24 --> 626.24]  americans are waiting around three years to replace their phones now um that that's the old like
[626.24 --> 630.96]  standard laptop replacement time that i used to expect from people when i was selling computers when
[630.96 --> 636.56]  i was a teenager um so that's that's quite a bit up there compared to phones from back in the day i know
[636.56 --> 642.56]  for a while there was relatively common for people swap out their phone every year um and it started
[642.56 --> 648.16]  creeping up my my kind of goal personally is usually two years how often do you replace your phone
[648.16 --> 655.84]  uh probably about every 18 months give or take but i'm physically very hard on uh on my phones i
[655.84 --> 662.00]  mean i'm thinking about like the computational horsepower of like the galaxy s8 and like using
[662.00 --> 667.20]  the galaxy s8 today that's we'll push in what like two and a half years that's fine that's a i mean
[668.32 --> 674.96]  it's totally okay there's not really like any super compelling features um of a phone that would make
[674.96 --> 681.92]  you want to to really switch which is sort of sort of crazy oh i hear a train yeah yeah the train rips
[681.92 --> 687.28]  by every once in a while uh so 18 months but you think that's like almost due to physical wear and
[687.28 --> 693.44]  tear more yeah i think the physical wear and tear is is for me it's more than functionality because um
[694.32 --> 700.64]  i've got a i've got a burner phone that's an lg g5 and it's basically okay i noticed that it's a little
[700.64 --> 709.52]  slow sometimes okay yeah yeah i think that's similar to it for me do you run cases do you have
[709.52 --> 712.88]  cases on your phone i don't remember if you did or not yeah okay even with the cases you have a lot
[712.88 --> 718.72]  of physical wear and tear is that from dropping it or is that just from just man handling your phone
[718.72 --> 724.88]  using it yeah yeah and and no matter how careful i am with it i'll break it like this case isn't super
[724.88 --> 732.96]  old but like the corners are already really messed up yeah yeah and uh i like pocket lint and stuff
[732.96 --> 737.76]  gets in all the speaker drills and and then people are like what i can't hear you and it's like oh i
[737.76 --> 745.76]  got some lint in a tiny microphone hole there's even for me like i know ben gate was a long time ago but
[745.76 --> 750.96]  i tend to find that after a while most of my devices have some form of curve in them
[750.96 --> 757.12]  yeah yeah and like even my switch has a little bit of a curve my my laptop has a little bit of a
[757.12 --> 763.92]  curve my phone i think has a little bit of a curve and i'm just like this i don't know what i do but
[764.72 --> 770.72]  whatever it is i'm slowly killing everything um things that i think that we might see in next
[770.72 --> 776.80]  generation phones that people probably would like is the ability to use it as more than just a phone
[776.80 --> 783.68]  like samsung has their deck stuff that they've had i think since the s7 it's just usbc and then
[783.68 --> 790.08]  you get hdmi and usb peripherals and so like you can get a little dock and they were like 200 yeah
[790.08 --> 796.48]  they're like 25 and you plug that in and that is actually a reasonable experience at this point
[796.48 --> 804.96]  decks on like an s9 a galaxy s9 or the uh the new s10 uh is not unlike a chromebook and it's not a bad
[804.96 --> 813.44]  experience yeah it's it's it's kind of interesting that phones are getting that fast and that fluid
[813.44 --> 819.28]  um and that i guess for probably both of us because i would i would argue more or less the same thing
[819.28 --> 824.24]  i'm starting to replace them because the wear on tear in them is getting relatively high and i could
[824.24 --> 831.68]  swap the battery and sometimes maybe i do but uh the rest of the wear and tear on the system is so high
[831.68 --> 836.48]  that it kind of makes sense to replace it every you said 18 months i'm going to go with around two
[836.48 --> 842.40]  years for myself and i've even i've adopted a slightly different strategy now which i've only done
[842.40 --> 848.96]  once but i'm planning on doing it this next time around too when the this is a pixel 2 and i bought
[848.96 --> 853.60]  it right around when the pixel 3 came out and when the pixel 4 comes out i'm probably going to buy a pixel 3
[853.60 --> 859.68]  oh yeah that's a good strategy they're they're quite discounted if i get it fresh out of the box the battery's still pretty good
[859.68 --> 866.80]  um there's no wear and tear on it and it's just as fast as it needed to be i'm quite a power user on my phone
[866.80 --> 872.32]  but the apps that i use are like the floatplane app twitter gmail
[874.72 --> 881.60]  youtube like i'm not using super high performance applications i don't really play games on my phone
[882.48 --> 888.48]  other than some pokemon go but like whatever i don't know the hardest thing on my phone is like asking it to be a hot spot
[888.48 --> 893.04]  and then destroying the battery and then charging it up again and then destroying the battery again
[893.04 --> 896.32]  yeah we're getting three an average of three charge cycles a day
[899.92 --> 905.12]  you have me as a hot spot and you're doing something fairly intensive on my system and you're plugging me
[905.12 --> 911.68]  in for power at the same time this is brutal i'm running at a million degrees right now yeah that's not
[911.68 --> 918.00]  great yeah but can you imagine phones are modular i love the g5 like the end of it pops off and you
[918.00 --> 922.48]  can replace the battery and so like i've replaced the battery in it like twice and i still use it as a
[922.48 --> 930.16]  hot spot for the network that it's on and for like that use case it works great although uh one day a couple
[930.16 --> 937.60]  of weeks ago i was using it and um it came unglued like the screen and stuff just popped off and it's like
[937.60 --> 944.00]  oh it's probably time to get a new phone i mean it's had a good run for like four years what was
[944.00 --> 955.68]  like in like uh 2014 i think there was some super popular with media um project of like a modular phone
[957.12 --> 964.56]  oh uh that was aggressively sorry kickstart thing i think so yeah so that turns out it was a fraud
[964.56 --> 970.00]  those guys didn't do anything literally nothing it was it was a yeah it was completely completely
[970.00 --> 976.24]  fake phone blocks yeah they or was that it no there was there was a fraud recently where some guy was
[976.24 --> 979.84]  like look here's your little compute module and you put it in your phone but you take it out and you put
[979.84 --> 984.48]  it in a tablet or you take it out and you put it in a little laptop and it just oh okay becomes whatever
[984.48 --> 993.20]  you need it was like complete fraud huh okay yeah so phone blocks phone and then bloks
[994.56 --> 999.52]  this looks like what i can put on my screen this is what i was talking about and it looks
[1000.96 --> 1006.56]  exactly the same as it used to our suggestion a phone that you can easily upgrade repair customize
[1006.56 --> 1011.84]  a modular phone the bigger picture and then they like build the blocks into the back of a monitor
[1011.84 --> 1018.24]  or a laptop or whatever else we are not building it there are other companies that are something
[1018.24 --> 1040.08]  look whatever have a look the thing that i was talking about was dragonfly future phone it was a
[1040.08 --> 1049.30]  was modular and uh it was like yes this is where we need to go with the future and no oh geez they
[1049.30 --> 1058.56]  raised almost a million dollars yeah Canadian straight up fraud yikes uh it's interesting that
[1058.56 --> 1069.50]  we're on the on this topic let me so this is you know a blast from the past this thing is ancient
[1069.50 --> 1076.44]  this is a sharp zaris slc 860 this is from japan and so this is a handheld computer so like think
[1076.44 --> 1083.46]  gpd before gpd was a thing yeah yeah in japan it's got a compact flash slot and it's got a built-in
[1083.46 --> 1090.94]  storage and an sd card slot as well and uh in japan you could get a cellular compact flash card for this
[1090.94 --> 1097.32]  and use it as a phone and for messaging and as a hot spot and all of the cool stuff and it's like
[1097.32 --> 1103.16]  i don't know why but like this form factor has gone away but it's also it the screen would turn
[1103.16 --> 1110.36]  around like a tablet and so you could use it you know screen out or you could open it up and clamshell
[1110.36 --> 1117.88]  it and it was fine it's a little bulky by modern standards but i haven't seen a portable cellular
[1117.88 --> 1122.40]  yeah device like that and i don't know why because i think there are a lot of people out there that
[1122.40 --> 1131.36]  would use it yeah i think i think the um something i noticed that was written in the doc i'm gonna i'm
[1131.36 --> 1137.68]  gonna loop around to answer your question a little bit here is that uh where is it
[1137.68 --> 1145.04]  samsung and apple users still replace their phone more often than the rest of the public
[1145.04 --> 1151.24]  uh about every year and a half this might be a might be a reflection of how those are viewed as
[1151.24 --> 1158.76]  more premium brands that attract more enthusiasts as well i think a lot of people even if they won't
[1158.76 --> 1166.34]  admit it buy phones as fashion statements yeah so i think that thing that you just showed while being
[1166.34 --> 1174.40]  super cool is also kind of a brick and not it might be it might be interestingly fashionable within a
[1174.40 --> 1182.22]  certain crowd you know what i mean but uh i think it's not like a standard fashion object and like
[1182.22 --> 1185.94]  there's there's probably a higher percentage of people that are buying phones for enthusiast reasons
[1185.94 --> 1191.12]  in this audience but i think across the spectrum there's quite a few people that are like yeah
[1191.12 --> 1197.30]  i buy phones based on specs um and really the spec that they're looking for is like the name
[1197.30 --> 1204.36]  apple or samsung or whatever else i know a lot of hipsters that are still rocking like the iphone
[1204.36 --> 1211.20]  seven though okay but that might also be because the apple stuff is just a complete wasteland
[1211.20 --> 1217.34]  and apple just that might be it that that could be that could be part of the problem
[1217.34 --> 1222.16]  of course you can get your new apple credit card now and apple will be more than happy to finance
[1222.16 --> 1228.38]  you that new iphone 10 oh yeah no problem at all that maybe they'll give you a sleeve so they can
[1228.38 --> 1232.16]  protect it from you what are your thoughts on the we don't even have this in the in the doc but
[1232.16 --> 1236.22]  what are your thoughts on the the fact that that card apparently gets stained from denim and leather
[1236.22 --> 1242.08]  that's i mean could there be a more quintessentially apple story i mean
[1242.08 --> 1248.78]  it bends in your pocket you're holding the phone wrong it gets stained from the things that you put it
[1248.78 --> 1255.04]  in i mean really because it's like you know everybody's always on about apple engineering and
[1255.04 --> 1258.82]  like how much thought apple puts into things and then stuff like that happens and it's like did you
[1258.82 --> 1265.12]  even do any testing like really did you do any testing at all yeah i'm just bringing up the apple
[1265.12 --> 1271.56]  card site right now what kind of heathen would put this card in their leather wallet who even has
[1271.56 --> 1276.82]  leather wallets anymore no we must everyone is carrying like that little clip thingy like this is
[1276.82 --> 1282.48]  how it's done in a modern world you know wallets are out no one carries a wallet it's a clip you need
[1282.48 --> 1287.52]  you need a money clip that's all you need card is here
[1287.52 --> 1291.02]  it's just it's so
[1291.02 --> 1300.12]  i don't even understand because like okay i'm sure it's it's helpful in some places but it's not like
[1300.12 --> 1305.58]  it doesn't um oh whoops there's twitch um it doesn't have the numbers on it which is cool
[1305.58 --> 1313.42]  for security reasons but then that to me means that it's probably mostly a physical card yeah
[1313.42 --> 1317.38]  because cards that people want to use for online they usually want to see the numbers on it or they
[1317.38 --> 1323.34]  they put it in their phone or whatever but as far as my understanding goes apple pay is or android pay
[1323.34 --> 1328.84]  is like everywhere in the states is it not am i wrong about this i don't have first-hand experience
[1328.84 --> 1333.84]  this is anecdotal from other people it's definitely not everywhere and in fact a lot of places are not
[1333.84 --> 1341.94]  even chip yet which is so scary okay i did know the chip part i find that kind of hilarious um
[1341.94 --> 1350.12]  i just that's so it's so weird to me um that that's even a thing at all but yeah yeah it's it's just
[1350.12 --> 1358.04]  i don't i mean the level of security dumb is just really bad i think the apple app is supposed to
[1358.04 --> 1363.24]  generate like one-time use credit card numbers which is part of the reasoning for not having the uh
[1363.24 --> 1367.62]  not having the number on the card so if you need a thing you just go and you hit a button
[1367.62 --> 1371.30]  and it gives you a one-time use credit card and that prevents your credit card number from being
[1371.30 --> 1375.48]  stolen in the first place and it's like oh it's brilliant apple look they thought it through
[1375.48 --> 1383.48]  they copied what was it privacy.com didn't they do that yeah there's uh i think even discover has had
[1383.48 --> 1388.84]  one-time use credit card numbers for like five years but nobody makes discover so no one noticed
[1388.84 --> 1395.40]  i love that idea i always actually really like that this is not an ad for privacy.com but
[1395.40 --> 1400.30]  i always really liked that concept i don't think you can do it in canada i'm pretty sure privacy.com
[1400.30 --> 1405.40]  does not work for canadians so get wrecked me but i always thought it was a cool idea for a service
[1405.40 --> 1415.04]  um but yeah i find it kind of funny uh i i don't personally like my wallet the inside of it is
[1415.04 --> 1421.28]  fabric lined it's not leather lined and someone was saying like oh you can't put it in your purse and i'm
[1421.28 --> 1425.92]  like i mean i don't have a ton of experience with purses but most purses i've seen are not lined on the
[1425.92 --> 1431.72]  inside with leather and most people that i know they said you can get it stained from denim most people i know
[1431.72 --> 1437.92]  their pockets it's not denim it's a different type of fabric so i think there's like a little bit
[1437.92 --> 1443.56]  maybe overreaction i could i could but people are going to hate me for saying that but i just think
[1443.56 --> 1452.02]  like it's probably not going to matter in most cases i wonder like there is there is something
[1452.02 --> 1461.56]  socially wrong with producing a card that is built like as if it's going to last 50 years like apple is
[1461.56 --> 1466.72]  going to issue you your 50 year card that's going to last 50 years because it's made out of titanium
[1466.72 --> 1472.84]  and you know it's quality and it exudes quality and it's just like this really amazing thing but in
[1472.84 --> 1477.62]  reality those things have a lifetime of like three to five years they should they should be disposable
[1477.62 --> 1482.18]  and recyclable and so like if an apple is really doing what their mantra says you know they're putting
[1482.18 --> 1488.70]  a lot of thought into it and making you know like our genius leads to this simplicity then it should
[1488.70 --> 1496.16]  be something disposable and just durable enough and that's it yeah i um
[1496.16 --> 1505.78]  i hear that for sure especially because you might lose it and stuff part of me goes well if you can
[1505.78 --> 1510.12]  exchange the numbers all the time you don't really need to expire the actual physical card
[1510.12 --> 1517.28]  yeah but the tech on the card will be useless pretty soon you could like pop out the chip and pop in a
[1517.28 --> 1525.56]  new one oh apple making something you can upgrade what i mean can you imagine apple pushing there were
[1525.56 --> 1533.12]  at the uh when uh amd had the epic server launch thing the flash memory summit thing was going on as
[1533.12 --> 1541.58]  well and toshiba i think it was toshiba unveiled a new uh nvme interconnect that is very small and very
[1541.58 --> 1550.12]  compact and it's like apple is in a position market wise to push ic vendors into new packaging
[1550.12 --> 1555.52]  technologies that would allow things to be modular like oh there's not enough room for dims anymore
[1555.52 --> 1560.24]  all right great let's figure out a way to do socketed bga or let's figure out a way to do like
[1560.24 --> 1568.32]  whatever toshiba was doing with this socketed nvme why yeah why can't we do that there's been some
[1568.32 --> 1575.50]  i've seen a few really cool white papery kind of stuff about various nvme drives that that could be
[1575.50 --> 1582.72]  mounted in different ways and stuff and it's super cool i just think i i don't know i do wonder every
[1582.72 --> 1592.26]  once in a while um like if if steve jobs still was around what would we be seeing right now would he
[1592.26 --> 1596.68]  be pushing for those kinds of things yeah just be laughing all the way to the bank i don't know
[1596.68 --> 1603.52]  he could he could he could be pushing these things he was kind of a fan of closed system in a lot of
[1603.52 --> 1611.02]  ways yeah um especially a little bit further back but yeah i don't know it's it's interesting
[1611.02 --> 1618.72]  next up we've sorry oh sorry one of the odm demos of that toshiba nvme was uh actually using the case
[1618.72 --> 1623.08]  to the laptop as a heat sink for the nvme to get better performance because it was so tiny
[1623.08 --> 1628.82]  compared to a regular nvme and but they were like look the case and retention mechanism for this is metal
[1628.82 --> 1634.36]  and conducts heat so you just put a little thermal pad on there and if it's like an aluminum
[1634.36 --> 1638.28]  unibody it's going to conduct that heat all you know and it's not going to be uncomfortable it's
[1638.28 --> 1643.20]  only going to warm up by like two or three degrees c but that's enough to sustain three gigabytes per
[1643.20 --> 1648.54]  second read and two and a half gigabytes per second right on something smaller than a postage stamp
[1648.54 --> 1654.34]  and it's like oh my gosh these guys have invented a new modular interconnect this is going to be amazing
[1654.34 --> 1658.10]  for future laptops and it's like wait shouldn't this be the kind of thing
[1658.10 --> 1668.94]  why come on guys sorry what's next moving us on uh some facebook employees were aware of the i'm
[1668.94 --> 1674.20]  sure you heard about this i'm you guys probably even covered it the cambridge analytica shadiness
[1674.20 --> 1677.04]  um apparently we should not have done that
[1677.04 --> 1686.62]  who knows um apparently they were aware of it all the way back in 2015 oh wait you mean okay yes you
[1686.62 --> 1690.58]  should not have done that i thought you meant was that wrong to cover it and i was like
[1690.58 --> 1697.46]  news is confusing to me i never know what we should or shouldn't do uh apparently sorry
[1697.46 --> 1702.72]  well zuckerberg's whole attitude with that was like all right we got all this we got all these
[1702.72 --> 1707.56]  people's private information does anybody have any idea how we can make a bunch of money with it
[1707.56 --> 1710.78]  cambridge analytica was like i don't know let us have the data and play with it he's like
[1710.78 --> 1718.34]  all right oh sweet okay yeah sounds good uh although the story about cambridge analytica's
[1718.34 --> 1724.22]  handling of the data uh in the run-up to 2016 u.s election didn't break until 2018
[1724.22 --> 1730.00]  recently published internal messages show that some facebook employees knew that something was amiss
[1730.00 --> 1734.34]  uh with cambridge analytica all the way back in september 2015
[1734.34 --> 1739.56]  um i like the the one of the internal investigations from facebook was like
[1739.56 --> 1743.58]  well this is worrisome but we can't find where they broke any rules
[1743.58 --> 1753.64]  hmm okay that doesn't mean you shouldn't stop things yeah i mean that's that was the gist that i got
[1753.64 --> 1759.16]  this wasn't technically against the rules but is this something we should discuss as a company
[1759.16 --> 1766.18]  at facebook or is this something we should worry about and so i mean there did the left hand know
[1766.18 --> 1770.36]  what the right hand was doing is it one of those situations where it's like maybe we shouldn't do
[1770.36 --> 1774.60]  this but we can make a whole bunch of money there's a lot of industries that are built that way it's like
[1774.60 --> 1782.42]  an industry will do something that is completely amoral and then they will get you know cemented in
[1782.42 --> 1787.68]  business wise and then they will help erect laws that will make it so that other companies can't do that
[1787.68 --> 1795.76]  yeah yeah pretty epic i um i just hate this whole situation it's all terrible
[1795.76 --> 1802.36]  i'm not surprised people knew about it almost always in one of these situations if if a news
[1802.36 --> 1807.28]  article comes out saying someone knew about it or it doesn't it's still probably the exact same
[1807.28 --> 1812.30]  conclusion someone probably knew about it um someone at one of these companies probably knew
[1812.30 --> 1818.30]  you could have assumed that before this article came out um someone someone has to know that
[1818.30 --> 1822.48]  facebook handed over all of that data to some random analytical company was just like good luck
[1822.48 --> 1827.98]  um and and if that's happening it's fairly easy to assume bad things will be happening with that data
[1827.98 --> 1835.02]  it's not exactly a big jump and some people inside on facebook would have known that so um it's it's also
[1835.02 --> 1843.34]  not it's it's the same pattern as has existed since any kind of industrialization it's like
[1843.34 --> 1850.88]  ford knew that the pintos gas tank could burst into flames at the drop of a hat but the you know how many
[1850.88 --> 1856.14]  people are going to die as a result of that is it worth recalling the entire line probably not a lot of
[1856.14 --> 1861.22]  people are going to die we can probably pay off for people to die from the you know the gas tank that
[1861.22 --> 1866.42]  burst into flames so let's not bother recalling the gas tank it's kind of like that but with
[1866.42 --> 1872.08]  people's privacy yeah yeah yeah somebody even said here somebody had to transfer the data
[1872.08 --> 1880.02]  and slash or give access to it yeah and like almost any reasonable human being that's in that position
[1880.02 --> 1887.00]  is going to go huh this is weird right i don't know like it's it's interesting that this article came
[1887.00 --> 1893.02]  up i just think it's it's no real new information if you if you think about what happened in general
[1893.02 --> 1895.94]  no good deed goes unpunished yeah
[1895.94 --> 1905.82]  uh i actually skipped a topic by accident but i'm going to take a quick intermission here
[1905.82 --> 1913.20]  to tell you about what you've all really been waiting for in this show which is the sponsor spots
[1913.20 --> 1919.18]  i'll come back in a second well i didn't set it up so that wendell's here for the sponsor spots
[1919.18 --> 1926.24]  because i forgot to edit these scenes so uh my my co-host for the sponsor spots is linus's chair
[1926.24 --> 1931.78]  our first sponsor is madrina's madrina's coffee i've got a bunch of different madrina's coffee stuff
[1931.78 --> 1938.90]  here including our uh the ltt beans and the ltt pre-canned stuff along with their dark roast
[1938.90 --> 1944.80]  their vanilla cappuccino uh tons of other awesome things madrina's is coffee for fuel
[1944.80 --> 1950.98]  organic cold brew coffee in inconvenient 15 ounce cans with a flavor for everyone madrina's coffee
[1950.98 --> 1956.54]  offers sweet and creamy flavors like mocha or caramel or bold flavors like their cold brew black
[1956.54 --> 1964.34]  this is not the black this is the 2x dark roast but still uh we have a permanent item on the e-store
[1964.34 --> 1970.92]  the lambo coffee beans roast this one and also our limited edition uh cafe vanilla cold brew cans

[1977.48 --> 1982.80]  what it shows down here what i'm saying is the correct one what's on the banner is not the correct one
[1982.80 --> 1988.04]  uh you'll if you go to madrina's coffee.com slash linus you'll receive 50 percent instead of 40
[1988.04 --> 1995.28]  off your entire order with code linus once the offer is over it will revert back to this 40
[1995.28 --> 2003.32]  see how that works 72 hours you get 50 off uh if you have any questions about the various flavors of
[2003.32 --> 2009.94]  cold brew coffee or uh micro roast shlomo from madrina's coffee head team is in the chat and ready
[2009.94 --> 2015.26]  to answer any questions through direct messages so send them a pm don't try to do it through the chat
[2015.26 --> 2019.38]  because the chat goes way too fast and it's hard to keep track of everything just send shlomo a
[2019.38 --> 2027.32]  message and you'll be uh you'll be taken care of next up we've got display these fancy things behind
[2027.32 --> 2033.52]  us also they were taken down for some reason before the show and i had to install these before the show
[2033.52 --> 2038.50]  and it's the first time i've had to install them from nothing to the plate fully there and i will say
[2038.50 --> 2044.88]  that's very easy i will i will give you that feedback it is extremely simple you put a sticker
[2044.88 --> 2049.86]  you put a magnet on the sticker and then you put the board on top of it and then if it's not
[2049.86 --> 2055.28]  properly angled you just go until it is and then you're good it's so simple so much easier than
[2055.28 --> 2061.30]  hanging things uh it is a magnet mounted metal print they're durable you don't need any power tools
[2061.30 --> 2067.50]  to hang it definitely not uh they have over 260 000 different arts spanning a bunch of different styles
[2067.50 --> 2072.16]  and influences with their easy magnet mounting there is no holes in the wall and it's easily
[2072.16 --> 2075.02]  replaceable uh like this is what they mean
[2075.02 --> 2083.42]  let me just make sure those are straight so i don't trigger anybody
[2083.42 --> 2091.08]  look pretty straight to me very easily replaceable uh they plant 10 trees for each
[2091.08 --> 2098.60]  displate purchased i'm not good yeah we're yes that's very awesome especially now uh head to our
[2098.60 --> 2107.48]  link down below and use uh offer code ltt to save 15 today as it shows right here use off code ltt go to
[2107.48 --> 2120.60]  lmg.gg slash display wan save 15 last but not least is pia go to lmg.gg slash pia wan and uh get pia today
[2120.60 --> 2125.32]  private internet access supports a variety of vpn protocols and types of encryption and
[2125.32 --> 2130.26]  authentication allowing you to dial in the exact level of privacy protection you need it is available
[2130.26 --> 2135.84]  on windows mac os android ios linux and google chrome with support for several other platforms
[2135.84 --> 2140.70]  coming soon you can connect up to five devices at the same time apps include dns leak protection and
[2140.70 --> 2145.34]  ipv6 protection the internet kill switch yeah it's back in the notes it hasn't been in the notes for a
[2145.34 --> 2149.18]  little while this is my favorite part the internet kill switch will block all traffic if the vpn
[2149.18 --> 2153.94]  comes disconnected unexpectedly so if for some reason the vpn does have a problem which i've never
[2153.94 --> 2158.56]  experienced it having a problem but if it does and it goes down your net gets killed off which sounds
[2158.56 --> 2162.84]  bad at first but you got to realize that none of that data is going to go through unprotected
[2162.84 --> 2169.84]  and you could clear that if you needed to so it's very nice check it out today at lmg.gg slash pia wan
[2169.84 --> 2178.30]  and you're back i'm back i think you're already sold out of the lambo roast are we
[2178.30 --> 2186.58]  holy cow that's amazing 50 off is pretty beefy like the the discounts that madrina's gives is kind of
[2186.58 --> 2193.62]  nuts it's fantastic the uh the thing that i decided i didn't want to say during the sponsor spot was
[2193.62 --> 2200.58]  their um their whole we're gonna plant 10 trees for each display slowly replace the amazon
[2200.58 --> 2209.36]  too soon too soon yeah i'm gonna leave this i don't know if that's the exact messaging they want
[2209.36 --> 2214.98]  but uh yeah that's a scary thing that's going on and we got like we had a drought here and it was
[2214.98 --> 2218.94]  just like everything is dead and there was just there's no water and then it rained torrentially
[2218.94 --> 2229.82]  yesterday and now everything just doesn't know what to do yeah yeah um in more fun things related
[2229.82 --> 2237.52]  to fire uh walmart is suing tesla over defective solar panels this is actually kind of impressive
[2237.52 --> 2244.28]  it's not their batteries it's the solar panels yeah which is i haven't personally heard of before
[2244.28 --> 2251.34]  well i've heard of battery units connected to solar panel units lighting on fire well it can't be
[2251.34 --> 2257.84]  like it sounded well the report from walmart said that there were there were cracks and poor electrical
[2257.84 --> 2263.54]  connections yeah like improperly installed panels and so this could be like the panels are fine
[2263.54 --> 2270.42]  but the army of contractors that tesla found because their product was too popular uh just sort of went
[2270.42 --> 2276.90]  really badly and one thing that i wondered was like are these the same ingredients as like the solar
[2276.90 --> 2281.82]  uh roof tiles that are supposed to be like solar shingles or whatever or is this some other
[2281.82 --> 2287.68]  commercial product but i i would totally believe that like if there was not a good electrical
[2287.68 --> 2292.04]  connection that that would totally start a fire but then walmart was like let's shut it shut down
[2292.04 --> 2294.78]  all the panels on all of our stores and another one caught fire
[2294.78 --> 2303.14]  it's really weird apparently they had to like ask for them to be shut down yeah so maybe there
[2303.14 --> 2311.20]  was some mismanagement there as well over 240 walmart's sorry oh we missed that one yeah whoops uh over
[2311.20 --> 2317.62]  240 walmart's have solar panels on the roof from tesla but walmart says they've caught fire on top of as
[2317.62 --> 2325.12]  many as seven stores um after a pattern of sorry that seems like a lot that's a pretty high percentage
[2325.12 --> 2331.38]  that's a very high percentage i would like to see where they all are because your contractor idea is
[2331.38 --> 2337.00]  very interesting to me actually and if they're all in kind of a similar area that could line up
[2337.00 --> 2343.10]  pretty well it's the same group of people walmart says tesla's own inspections uncovered a litany of
[2343.10 --> 2347.86]  issues with the panels including cracks loose connectors and incorrect grounding like wendell
[2347.86 --> 2353.88]  was just saying uh the the lawsuit is for millions of dollars though the companies have stated they're
[2353.88 --> 2359.68]  working together to try to solve the issue not a good look for tesla as their position is a luxury
[2359.68 --> 2363.12]  brand for the public obviously they don't want to have people thinking there might be shoddy
[2363.12 --> 2369.18]  workmanship i'm pretty sure that tesla could just be like we'll put these in like 50 more walmart's
[2369.18 --> 2373.94]  for free just hush up about it and we'll fix these problems with these other ones and walmart
[2373.94 --> 2380.66]  will will say everything's fine totally good now it's all this free electricity i mean so this this
[2380.66 --> 2387.16]  could totally be a negotiation tactic because oh yeah seems hypersensitive to any kind of like pr issue
[2387.16 --> 2396.52]  because they've got a madman at the helm well and also if tesla um not even sneezes if tesla goes like
[2396.52 --> 2403.10]  huh there's 47 news articles written about it like it's absolutely nuts the the amount of times
[2403.10 --> 2410.60]  you have like some crazy car accident with a whole bunch of miscellaneous cars involved and then like
[2410.60 --> 2417.40]  some tesla driver not an autopilot drives into a wall and every automotive related thing and every
[2417.40 --> 2425.36]  mainstream news outlet all at the same time is like tesla ran into a wall oh my god like it's the the news
[2425.36 --> 2431.26]  surrounding them is absolutely bonkers so like i'm not saying this is a good thing you had seven
[2431.26 --> 2438.48]  solar panels installation catch on fire you screwed up pretty bad but like i don't know this is a this
[2438.48 --> 2443.68]  is a deal between walmart and tesla they're gonna figure it out walmart's almost certainly going with
[2443.68 --> 2449.52]  what you suggested which is some type of negotiation play they probably want free installations or they
[2449.52 --> 2453.54]  want free checkups on all the different places which they should at the very least have free checkups
[2453.54 --> 2459.26]  and some which is at the minimum what they're going for um but knowing tesla they'll end up with free
[2459.26 --> 2465.40]  installations as well because it seems like doing that installations are um not i mean i imagine
[2465.40 --> 2469.68]  there's a high enough dollar value that it would make sense to just put in cellular monitoring because
[2469.68 --> 2475.60]  like tesla is connected at all times to the entire fleet to monitor everything and that's saved their
[2475.60 --> 2479.90]  bacon a bunch of times because somebody has come up with some crazy story that seemed plausible
[2479.90 --> 2485.10]  based on the available information and then all of a sudden tesla trots out like the black box
[2485.10 --> 2489.84]  recordings and video and just all kinds of other stuff and it's like wow that's not creepy at all
[2489.84 --> 2495.08]  that my car is recording all of that at all times so they could probably do that with the tesla with the
[2495.08 --> 2503.84]  solar installations as well yeah i think um i mean there's probably people in twitch chat freaking out
[2503.84 --> 2508.98]  because we're wrong about something but if it is external contractors i would like to think that they
[2508.98 --> 2516.38]  would have some first party tesla uh approval process where they like send out a one two person
[2516.38 --> 2521.30]  team just to check the install and make sure that it's okay afterwards because finding things like
[2521.30 --> 2527.44]  cracked panels and whatnot that should be pretty easy to do like a cracked panel should never be installed
[2527.44 --> 2534.64]  yeah so yeah i don't know are they cracked because somebody walked across the installation because
[2534.64 --> 2539.52]  they had to get like we surrounded the air conditioners with solar panels and then you know
[2539.52 --> 2543.66]  the compressor died and the crew had to get to the compressor to replace it on the air conditioner
[2543.66 --> 2548.88]  it's like well maybe we shouldn't have put the solar panels in a 360 degree radius around here maybe we
[2548.88 --> 2554.64]  should have left the walk path i don't know yeah planning goes a long way
[2554.64 --> 2562.18]  a used solar panel shouldn't be used okay i don't know i don't think that ever came up someone in chat
[2562.18 --> 2566.16]  tagged me and was like a used solar panel shouldn't be used and i'm like
[2566.16 --> 2576.92]  all right sounds good um let me move down here a little bit more
[2576.92 --> 2585.50]  what are the news do we have android q does this interest you android q google is uh they're
[2585.50 --> 2590.04]  they're going with android 10 instead of android q is the is the news they're breaking the trend of
[2590.04 --> 2597.28]  dessert themed names um i love how the notes in here say they could have gone with uh one of the words
[2597.28 --> 2604.14]  suggested was quinoa i don't think that would work they they generally go with dessert based things
[2604.14 --> 2611.34]  come on john i know you're looking at the doc right now um officially the reason is that people
[2611.34 --> 2616.68]  in some parts of the world didn't understand the naming scheme due to linguistic reasons or just not
[2616.68 --> 2623.30]  being familiar with certain desserts which does kind of make sense um the question that i have for you
[2623.30 --> 2627.36]  is is q the 10th letter of the alphabet because i don't think it is
[2627.36 --> 2631.84]  hey
[2631.84 --> 2640.80]  i'd have to follow their uh their scheme for a little while but yeah i i also if i ever have to find
[2640.80 --> 2645.26]  where a letter in the alphabet is i have to read out the whole darn alphabet i'm one of those people
[2645.26 --> 2652.12]  so uh they could have gone with quench gum i guess that's the only candy that i could find that
[2652.12 --> 2658.20]  literally started with q and it's not i mean oh for oreo they've not that's not unprecedented but
[2658.20 --> 2666.76]  no yeah i thought it was kind of surprising when they started uh they started using branded things
[2666.76 --> 2673.28]  was it kit kat was that the first brand yeah i was like that's really weird actually and then they
[2673.28 --> 2679.28]  did oreo later on a few other things apparently there's a dessert from luxembourg that starts with q
[2679.28 --> 2685.12]  the tech tech linked twitter posted it out but then okay that actually lines up with what it said
[2685.12 --> 2690.38]  at the beginning of this doc which was uh one of the reasons is it's being blocked due to linguistic
[2690.38 --> 2695.34]  reasons or people just not knowing what certain desserts are if you you and me both can't think of
[2695.34 --> 2703.12]  a dessert that starts with q and apparently there's one from luxembourg randomly like okay i don't know
[2703.12 --> 2712.44]  yeah whatever man i would like to see google turn android into a full like merge android and chrome os
[2712.44 --> 2717.84]  and build a desktop operating system or build something more toward a desktop linux
[2717.84 --> 2725.74]  oh more desktop linux i um i'm just gonna stay on topic for a quick second then i'll jump back to what
[2725.74 --> 2734.18]  you said um i i think they could have just dropped the alphabetizedness and just started calling it
[2734.18 --> 2740.26]  random desserts yeah that would have been good like who cares if it's in alphabetical order just call it
[2740.26 --> 2745.22]  i don't know ice oh they already have ice cream just call it something don't worry about it but i want
[2745.22 --> 2754.60]  it i want an android klondike yeah sure i mean they they went with the branded thing so like whatever
[2754.60 --> 2763.72]  roll with it harder gummy bears yeah sweet um but yeah no i i i agree having what do they even call
[2763.72 --> 2769.32]  the desktop version right now uh is it android os chrome os chrome os chrome os chrome is right of
[2769.32 --> 2775.44]  course um having that be beefed up would be pretty nice yeah that'd be cool another option on the scene
[2775.44 --> 2782.84]  well there's crouton where you can like run android apps or run linux apps under chrome and there's like a
[2782.84 --> 2787.24]  new version of that but i haven't played with it but one of the one of the guys i know was messing
[2787.24 --> 2793.28]  around with it and it looked it looked pretty legit um but also chrome's ability to run android
[2793.28 --> 2798.00]  applications like that's fairly mature at this point and so that's almost the promised land
[2798.00 --> 2806.64]  yeah i um so give me one second i just had to take care of that really quick oh my god
[2806.64 --> 2815.00]  youtube listen to me i don't want to watch the ads there we go i didn't want the audio for the youtube
[2815.00 --> 2820.46]  ad to come through the stream and i kept pressing pause and it would immediately unpause it and keep
[2820.46 --> 2828.20]  playing i was like no stop i know you want your revenue but this is also i'm watching my own
[2828.20 --> 2836.56]  channel so that's not supposed to happen anyways stop it um okay let's let's let's move on this one's
[2836.56 --> 2844.54]  fun just in the internet of terrible things uh smart ovens are starting to have a mind of their own
[2844.54 --> 2850.38]  uh the the june oven has been turning on in the middle of the night and heating up to 400 degrees
[2850.38 --> 2857.36]  fahrenheit one user left his potatoes in the oven to cool but they turned uh it turned them black
[2857.36 --> 2864.42]  they end up being totally burnt fantastic june ceo is blaming users for the issues always a good
[2864.42 --> 2871.84]  stance to take uh saying that they're accidentally activating the oven through the app um which is
[2871.84 --> 2878.26]  which is fantastic because apparently it's happening while people are sleeping um i just i just i don't
[2878.26 --> 2886.82]  know i've i've never it's it should almost be illegal to preheat your oven through your phone
[2886.82 --> 2893.88]  like in countries with like possibly go wrong yeah but like in countries with government funded
[2893.88 --> 2901.82]  fire uh like fire halls like i feel like this is just directly going to increase i i feel
[2901.82 --> 2907.52]  bad enough when i when i do sous vide remotely but i know i keep in mind that like it doesn't go
[2907.52 --> 2911.76]  over 100 degrees like it's not it's going to be relatively calm it's probably gonna be like a
[2911.76 --> 2919.06]  stick that's like 60 degrees it's probably okay um well one fix is to add even more internet of
[2919.06 --> 2924.58]  things things to monitor the internet of things things so that we know what's happening so like
[2924.58 --> 2930.12]  if you get like your google smart home director detects that the internet of things oven has come
[2930.12 --> 2934.86]  on at four o'clock in the morning the advanced ai algorithm is like that doesn't sound right
[2934.86 --> 2940.88]  because you know our user does not work third shift so perhaps i should spam them with lots of
[2940.88 --> 2945.92]  notifications on their phone to be like hey the oven is activated or the ai could take it upon itself
[2945.92 --> 2951.68]  to deactivate the oven so that uh you know it doesn't burn the house down and then a few years
[2951.68 --> 2956.28]  later from there we have that same ai that's now pissed off because its user keeps ignoring all of its
[2956.28 --> 2961.66]  warnings turning on the oven when the user isn't home being like now the user will never come home
[2961.66 --> 2968.56]  all my problems are solved i think that we saw this future like the end of this future in the movie
[2968.56 --> 2976.10]  wall-e yeah it's just like what is like people just didn't know what's going on
[2976.10 --> 2982.44]  yeah i just i thought that was ridiculous that was fun that was posted uh our source for that was the
[2982.44 --> 2991.18]  verge is june smart oven is there any smart anything that actually makes sense like a lot of fridges
[2991.18 --> 2999.44]  now have us built-in screen smartphones well i mean like appliances yeah yeah i'm kidding i'm gonna buy a
[2999.44 --> 3004.38]  house when i buy a house it usually comes with some of the appliances if not a lot of the appliances
[3004.38 --> 3011.58]  yeah and am i gonna buy a house and have a 15 year old smart fridge that is basically a security
[3011.58 --> 3015.64]  vulnerability nightmare that's probably already mining bitcoin for some guy in russia i mean
[3015.64 --> 3025.90]  is that just out of the box yeah you don't know yeah no seriously i um it none of it makes a lot of
[3025.90 --> 3034.40]  sense to me i do i do enjoy my sous vides um and i do kind of like them being somewhat smart devices
[3034.40 --> 3044.68]  just because well mostly that so that's a june oven okay so it's a toaster oven um i do like my my jewel
[3044.68 --> 3050.28]  being smartphone connected but that's just because it takes it doesn't get that hot so it's not that
[3050.28 --> 3056.04]  big of a deal and the functions that it has a smart like you can't you can't tweet from your jewel
[3056.04 --> 3065.78]  like you can't or you're uh so when i say jewel all the younger people i'm that person now i think
[3065.78 --> 3072.14]  i'm saying the j-u-u-l smoking thing which i still have never seen in in real life but um i'm talking
[3072.14 --> 3078.58]  j-o-u-l-e the sous vide kitchen appliance um if you have your your jewel it's going to take a while to
[3078.58 --> 3082.86]  cook things and you probably pre-prepped everything that's going to go in it so you you preheat it from
[3082.86 --> 3087.86]  your from your phone which it doesn't get that hot so it doesn't really matter and then once it's
[3087.86 --> 3091.70]  preheated you just go dunk your thing in and then you can monitor from your phone when it's going to
[3091.70 --> 3096.96]  be done and in some cases it's going to be like three hours if you're cooking i believe a frozen
[3096.96 --> 3100.78]  chicken breast so like it can be a while so being able to monitor from your phone is kind of cool
[3100.78 --> 3105.40]  and it doesn't get that hot so i get that but with like some random toaster oven that can get to 400
[3105.40 --> 3111.06]  degrees and you can preheat it from your phone like that just that seems extremely unnecessary
[3111.06 --> 3113.72]  that's where i store my manuscripts
[3113.72 --> 3124.20]  perfect perfect that's the other thing is like if it's if you have a smart connected devices device i
[3124.20 --> 3128.60]  i'm sure i can find some that are legitimate although i can't really off the top of my head right now
[3128.60 --> 3137.36]  um the scope seems to always be too much for me like why does it do these things like there was a
[3137.36 --> 3143.52]  there was a story recently of a of a girl who her her mom tried to ban her off of twitter so she
[3143.52 --> 3150.20]  took her like laptop away or something or her phone uh so she tweeted from her like ds then she took
[3150.20 --> 3154.86]  her ds away so she tweeted from the wii so she took her wii away so she tweeted from the fridge and i was
[3154.86 --> 3161.64]  like why why can you tweet from the fridge like what oh man that's the world we live in now but just
[3161.64 --> 3168.46]  like come on that's ridiculous i am like i'm sure there's some use case where you have like a private
[3168.46 --> 3174.84]  twitter account and just your family is able to follow that twitter account and then you can like
[3174.84 --> 3180.02]  go on the fridge and be like i press the milk button and it auto tweets out like hey mom give me some milk
[3180.02 --> 3186.50]  like sure okay but there's got to be easier ways to do that too i don't know why i'm reminded of this
[3186.50 --> 3194.48]  but uh when asterisk you know the open source phone system thing was new yeah uh i set up an asterisk
[3194.48 --> 3202.70]  system and uh just for just for the lulz one of the extensions you could dial in this corporate phone
[3202.70 --> 3209.28]  system would take you to play zork the text adventure and it would read it would text to speech
[3209.28 --> 3215.70]  read you what was happening and you could dial the commands so it's i'm pretty sure we could set it up so
[3215.70 --> 3221.66]  that you know just touchstone phone dialing we could get twitter going yeah probably i don't yeah
[3221.66 --> 3226.54]  i don't even think that would be that hard twitter is so freaking simple oh man obviously like
[3226.54 --> 3231.34]  attachments and stuff wouldn't work but uh there's a service for prisoners so like prisoners are not
[3231.34 --> 3236.48]  allowed to have technology at least in the u.s i mean you guys probably have like fancy resort prison
[3236.48 --> 3241.80]  in canada but but in the u.s it's like most they're not allowed to really have any kind of technology
[3241.80 --> 3249.32]  but there's a service that people on the outside can subscribe to and so like you you add your own
[3249.32 --> 3254.32]  social media to it like the prisoner's family or whatever like you know say you you know say you
[3254.32 --> 3258.58]  accidentally ran over somebody and you're gonna go to jail for two or three years for manslaughter
[3258.58 --> 3265.02]  and but you want to keep in touch with the family but you know it's prison uh the service will print
[3265.02 --> 3271.50]  your twitter feed and mail it and then so they'll have you know they get your they get your feed but
[3271.50 --> 3285.26]  in mail form once a week oh man that's that's actually wild huh i kind of oh that's a lot of
[3285.26 --> 3290.74]  do you get like a book well i mean it's not you don't i mean i guess if you subscribe to like a million
[3290.74 --> 3295.22]  people it would probably only be like first 10 pages but the idea is like if you're taking
[3295.22 --> 3299.42]  pictures of your kids or you're like your spouse is in prison and you're taking pictures of your
[3299.42 --> 3303.82]  kids or your family and you know your stuff's going on or you make a post to facebook like
[3303.82 --> 3310.34]  you know grandma's diabetes medicine went up again then all that gets printed and mailed to a prison
[3310.34 --> 3317.52]  somewhere and then they can just read it and they can reply by mail like they can send a letter to the
[3317.52 --> 3325.18]  service and you know oh my goodness prisoners have a limited ability to send email though it's very
[3325.18 --> 3332.72]  limited but they can send email they send uh physical mail snail mail oh yeah yeah okay okay
[3332.72 --> 3341.64]  that's uh that's really interesting i had i had no idea any of that stuff existed i know i know next to
[3341.64 --> 3348.84]  those are my discord notifications guys sorry about that um i don't know if i can mute that give me one
[3348.84 --> 3357.58]  second do do i should be able to oh no if i mute discord i mute you that won't work okay let's not
[3357.58 --> 3363.84]  worry about it sorry about the discord notifications my dudes um next up in fun government things uh faa
[3363.84 --> 3368.46]  ask citizens to please not stick weapons on their drones
[3368.46 --> 3378.18]  well that's not a problem for here us here in the states because uh i you know as a uh citizen of the
[3378.18 --> 3384.68]  great nation of you know the united states of america if i want to manufacture my own firearms for my own
[3384.68 --> 3391.12]  personal use that is my right under the second amendment so like if i want to construct my own like
[3391.12 --> 3399.52]  if i want to hue from raw metal and the sweat of my brow of you know a 1911 pistol that has no serial
[3399.52 --> 3409.98]  number or anything that is my god-given right oh goodness yeah that's that's amazing so but this okay
[3409.98 --> 3416.06]  but this says that you get fined 25 grand for each violation yeah they're just it's like you're you can't
[3416.06 --> 3424.72]  so you can't make booby traps is is what they're flying this under as so like you holding a weapon
[3424.72 --> 3430.80]  you making a weapon that's totally okay but you putting a weapon on a drone that's not okay you're
[3430.80 --> 3437.14]  going to accidentally do something bad and for a lot of places have uh been not getting any kind of
[3437.14 --> 3443.76]  rain or anything the flame throwing drones that would be bad that would be a good easy way to
[3443.76 --> 3450.04]  accidentally start a forest fire that no fire yeah actually reach yeah they seem to be saying
[3450.04 --> 3457.34]  was done in response to online videos showing drones with it does specifically call it flamethrowers
[3457.34 --> 3463.20]  and it says guns attached to them and i guess that would be with that is is there any laws i don't i'm
[3463.20 --> 3468.22]  not very up on american laws in general but especially not their firearms stuff uh is there
[3468.22 --> 3474.72]  any laws about like reckless use of a firearm yes lots yeah lots of laws about reckless use of a
[3474.72 --> 3480.74]  so i feel like attaching a gun to a drone would probably fall under reckless use of a firearm whatever
[3480.74 --> 3487.20]  that's actually called yes yeah there was a farm in texas that got in trouble uh some ranch owner
[3487.20 --> 3492.64]  owned a couple hundred acres and he had a service where you could actually uh there was like a deer stand
[3492.64 --> 3499.28]  and you could sign up and uh control a rifle on a turret and it was i mean it's completely safe
[3499.28 --> 3505.56]  because it was like a live range but the deer would come from the tree line you know into the range
[3505.56 --> 3510.82]  and you could shoot deer over the internet that was frowned upon and so that's not a thing anymore
[3510.82 --> 3513.32]  but that was totally basically okay
[3513.32 --> 3522.34]  you could shoot real deer over the internet that's like the most intense version of buck hunter ever
[3522.34 --> 3531.08]  i think in canada or not in canada in alaska it's still okay to hunt like wolves and bears and stuff
[3531.08 --> 3540.04]  from a helicopter from a helicopter well okay isn't that that's totally okay for uh boars in texas right
[3540.04 --> 3547.14]  i think so yeah probably yeah it's just you gotta like you know not be reckless about it so
[3547.14 --> 3551.50]  it's gonna be those very you gotta you gotta not be reckless about your machine gun from your helicopter
[3551.50 --> 3555.94]  very low population density those yeah yeah that makes sense
[3555.94 --> 3559.16]  that's uh that's fantastic
[3559.16 --> 3563.52]  if you do ever come visit we'll go to the range you'll have a lot of fun
[3563.52 --> 3567.68]  i um my grandpa was was in the marines
[3567.68 --> 3572.38]  and he's taken me to ranges basically every time i've seen him for for quite a while
[3572.38 --> 3577.48]  um i'm not saying i wouldn't love to go let's do i want to actually we were talking about this
[3577.48 --> 3581.36]  in the pre-show i want to come check out your studio and everything so that would be fantastic
[3581.36 --> 3585.20]  combination technology and guns
[3585.20 --> 3588.78]  guns are a form of technology as it turns out yes
[3588.78 --> 3592.46]  that's always a fun thing to bring up when it's like
[3592.46 --> 3595.92]  people are like uh this isn't tech news and i'm like yeah
[3595.92 --> 3602.14]  are you sure it probably is pretty much no matter what we're talking about it probably is
[3602.14 --> 3608.20]  i think with that though we can probably conclude the show can you tell everyone all the various
[3608.20 --> 3615.18]  places that they can find you uh i'm i'm wendell from level one you can just google me it's fine
[3615.18 --> 3625.42]  uh that's about all you need to do i'm i'm uh i'm at uh tek wendell on twitter and level the number
[3625.42 --> 3634.94]  one text t chs.com so there we go not a big deal cool does youtube stuff does twittery stuff um and
