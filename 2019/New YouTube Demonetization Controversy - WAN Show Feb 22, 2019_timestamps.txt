Google NEEDS to start communicating more proactively with their content creators.  I mean, this whole children with videos thing.  Youtube doesn't want to be a child porn site even unintentionally, advertisers don't want to be associated with media being used as such even unintentionally, and parents of kids posting videos online don't want their children viewed by pedophiles.  So, Google could have won a LOT of points with EVERYONE about this if they issued a statement that said "Hey guys, Google here.  We've got a bit of a problem with pedophiles using Youtube to look at children, and we believe they're targeting your channel.  We know you're using our site correctly and safely within our guidelines, you are not in trouble.  In order to combat this problem we're temporarily locking down your channel among others while we work on a solution to this problem.  Bear with us, and if we can help you increase your online safety in any way or if you can offer us any helpful information, please feel free to respond to this email."
That's not what they did.  They used the same mechanisms by which thieves are supposed to be caught to just shut people down without warning or explanation, even explicitly stating "even though we know you made a deliberate and substantial effort to obey all the rules, we're punishing you anyway because you're not worth any effort on our part."
I'm actually not sure what to do about the problem, ultimately.  I mean, okay. You've got a 5 year old kid who is into gymnastics, and you want to participate in a community of other families with young gymnasts.  That's great, that's healthy internet use.  There are people out there who--when given access to a video of young children in leotards, they're gonna whack it.  That is NOT healthy internet use, and THAT part is the problem.  The anonymity of the comments section emboldened them to post comments pointing out time stamps of...moments of interest...The problem is, banning those commenting accounts doesn't fix it.  As Linus says, external references of time stamps are possible, and most content on Youtube is available to those browsing without an account at all.  It's also possible that those videos get ripped from Youtube and rehosted on a tor site somewhere (or fucking 8chan), timestamped or edited for...purpose.  Hell, banning a user account doesn't accomplish much since they're free and unverified.
Perhaps certain videos (those containing minors, involving potentially illegal activities ie lockpicking or computer hacking, sexual content, references to drugs or alcohol) need to be restricted to access by accounts that are linked to the user's actual identity so that threatening, illegal or squick behavior can get an actual human perma-banned or prosecuted IRL?  Could you also maybe do some preventative rather than reactive stuff, like ban those convicted of, say, burglary, from accessing lockpicking videos?

timestamps for when the LTX talk is finished would be great. This crap should've been kept on the live stream. I mean the the % of people attending LTX vs the LTT sub base has got to be tiny and shouldn't warrent 50% of the content being released..
FYI the LTX talk ends at 12:09
