Regarding Vehicle manufacturers (timestamp 51:00 area), changes to current models are absolutely a thing. To preface what I say hereafter, I used to work for Jaguar (10 years) and then moved to Lotus (3 years) before leaving the industry all together, so I can't speak for EVERY manufacturer but I can speak for SOME.  Product recalls and TSBs (Technical Service Bulletins) have been around since the 70's. When we found the power steering on the XJS and XJ6 (XJ40 model) was not working as intended, we wrote up a TSB and created a modified part. This was then carried out free of charge to those clients who owned an affected model. The TSB has no expiry date, so if a client came to the dealer 10 years after and the TSB hadn't been carried out (for whatever reason) Jaguar would still honour that payment to the dealership for replacing the OE part with the TSB part. Lotus had less funding to do things like that too often, but even they as a niche company still rectified and modified vehicle issue. Ford has an all-Electric option - The Mach-E, I would suggest Tesla is going to be challenged by the conventional car industry before this new start-up.
