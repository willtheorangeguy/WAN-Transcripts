[0.00 → 8.22] All right, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to another spectacular WAN show.
[9.18 → 11.76] Another? Has there ever been a spectacular WAN show?
[11.82 → 16.96] Well, another, if you liked previous WAN shows, then this is pretty much more of the same.
[17.12 → 18.86] There's been some pretty spectacular WAN shows.
[18.94 → 20.80] I think there's been some pretty spectacular WAN shows.
[21.04 → 23.68] We've got a bunch of great topics for you guys today,
[23.68 → 35.00] including the big controversy where YouTube is demonetizing channels over the comments that other users post under their videos.
[35.26 → 36.86] More on this at 11.
[37.00 → 40.26] I love it. I'm so happy. I'm just, it's so great.
[40.40 → 42.56] There's also Samsung Galaxy Fold.
[43.16 → 43.46] Yeah.
[43.58 → 47.02] If you want to spend considerably more than I spent on my first car on a phone.
[48.18 → 51.26] There's Apple 2019 leaks and more.
[52.26 → 53.28] Yeah, there we go.
[53.28 → 54.76] Why don't we do the intro for a change?
[55.06 → 55.44] Sure.
[57.56 → 59.28] Well, that wasn't successful.
[65.98 → 67.36] Oh my goodness.
[68.66 → 70.06] Oh, that was so good.
[72.16 → 76.50] And remember, kids, you can't say demonetized without demon.
[79.12 → 80.26] That's not my joke.
[80.26 → 84.24] It's from I paint mistaken in the chat.
[84.38 → 84.62] Ah.
[84.96 → 85.40] Very nice.
[85.54 → 85.92] That's good.
[86.10 → 89.60] Should have hired this dude or Odette as a writer around here.
[90.10 → 90.58] 100%.
[90.58 → 90.86] Wait.
[91.66 → 92.14] Yes.
[92.62 → 92.96] Oh.
[92.96 → 95.68] Savage jerky sponsor today.
[95.86 → 97.24] Your jerky is there.
[97.24 → 98.14] Are those spice rubs?
[98.26 → 99.06] I just want to do it now.
[99.54 → 100.02] Yes.
[100.28 → 100.54] Oh.
[100.86 → 104.94] I actually had some of the ghost pepper hot sauce with my pasta.
[105.66 → 106.64] Hot sauce and pasta.
[106.76 → 107.04] You down?
[107.04 → 111.58] I'm talking like red sauce, pasta, like meat sauce.
[111.74 → 112.52] I haven't had it before.
[112.60 → 113.86] It seems like it would go really well, though.
[113.94 → 114.30] Oh.
[115.56 → 116.26] So good.
[117.40 → 118.46] I'm so happy.
[118.46 → 120.98] It makes sense.
[121.04 → 121.34] Whatever.
[121.54 → 123.58] We'll cover the sponsor stuff later.
[123.58 → 124.68] In the sponsor spot.
[124.68 → 125.44] In the sponsor part.
[125.46 → 126.10] Where it's supposed to go.
[126.18 → 128.98] So I actually had a really cool week.
[129.06 → 130.82] We did some really neat videos this week.
[131.26 → 134.70] I'd love to tell you about them, but I no longer, you know what?
[134.76 → 135.94] Let's talk about this first.
[135.94 → 141.50] I no longer do the WAN show on my daily driver laptop.
[141.88 → 142.20] Yeah.
[142.68 → 149.44] Because some of you may or may not have noticed this, but over the last few weeks, there have
[149.44 → 154.04] been a couple of WAN shows that mysteriously went missing.
[155.26 → 163.02] And they were either just not uploaded immediately after we broadcast, or they were live for a short
[163.02 → 164.98] period of time and then gone.
[165.94 → 169.56] What's weird is YouTube just glitched.
[169.64 → 169.90] Oh, no.
[169.96 → 170.66] That makes sense.
[171.08 → 171.26] Wait.
[171.50 → 172.58] That doesn't actually make sense.
[172.68 → 173.60] No, that doesn't make sense.
[174.28 → 174.90] Is it our side?
[175.28 → 176.30] YouTube froze for a second.
[176.40 → 177.14] Let me just...
[177.14 → 182.84] I have actually noticed this computer is probably long overdue for a reboot, if nothing else.
[185.20 → 186.46] So we'll get to that.
[186.48 → 187.26] No, it's been rebooted.
[187.58 → 187.78] Okay.
[187.92 → 188.28] I don't know.
[188.52 → 188.96] We'll...
[188.96 → 191.58] It seems fine now.
[191.58 → 192.56] Figure that out another time.
[192.56 → 192.86] It seems okay.
[192.96 → 194.58] Anyway, a couple of WAN shows disappeared.
[194.58 → 203.36] And the reason for that was not contrary to some fairly aluminum foil hat type speculation.
[203.70 → 204.64] I heard people saying it was...
[204.64 → 205.08] Yeah.
[205.24 → 206.78] I slammed that down because that was not it.
[206.84 → 207.68] Nothing to do with Vox.
[207.72 → 207.90] No.
[208.28 → 209.32] Nothing to do with Google.
[209.42 → 210.98] Google did not pull down the WAN show.
[211.10 → 211.20] No.
[211.20 → 226.52] And nothing to do with me trying to suppress information that I had said on the WAN show about like the whole content ID claim thing that went on.
[226.58 → 227.28] Nothing like that.
[227.52 → 233.64] What actually happened was there was some personal information of mine that was leaked in one of them.
[233.64 → 236.92] And then there was some personal information of some of our staff that was leaked in another one.
[237.26 → 242.70] So in order to ensure that I don't have spreadsheets or other things...
[242.70 → 244.42] Yeah, that works super well.
[244.42 → 245.68] Open on my laptop.
[245.68 → 247.92] I have gotten a different one.
[248.02 → 253.68] However, it's not a perfect fix because actually one of those times I was already using this one.
[253.68 → 255.62] But I was signed in to Chrome.
[255.88 → 256.46] Which like...
[256.98 → 260.70] Which carries a lot of personal information with it.
[260.90 → 261.58] Things are hard.
[261.72 → 261.88] Okay.
[262.02 → 262.26] Yeah.
[263.48 → 266.68] I never claimed to be some kind of tech guru.
[266.68 → 271.74] They put me on that pedestal.
[272.04 → 272.76] No, you did.
[272.86 → 273.34] No, I didn't.
[273.38 → 274.30] You named the channel.
[276.20 → 277.78] I, your name's in it.
[278.78 → 280.12] And then Tech Tips.
[282.06 → 284.58] I didn't name the channel, actually.
[284.80 → 285.54] That was your boss.
[285.60 → 286.26] That's my defence.
[286.36 → 288.36] You didn't exactly fight against it, though, I'm sure.
[289.48 → 292.22] I named the NCI channel, which I hosted.
[293.06 → 294.46] NCI Tech Tips.
[294.46 → 294.86] NCI.
[295.20 → 296.40] So I'm at...
[296.40 → 298.34] I am partially responsible.
[301.50 → 302.38] Oh, man.
[304.66 → 305.06] Yeah.
[305.48 → 307.26] So what was I talking about?
[307.50 → 309.60] You were talking about your laptop, but I'm not entirely sure why.
[309.84 → 311.42] I don't remember why.
[311.62 → 312.92] I actually...
[312.92 → 314.08] I have no...
[314.08 → 315.46] Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[316.64 → 317.16] LTD.
[317.50 → 317.86] Okay.
[318.02 → 319.56] Remember I told you there was an update?
[320.16 → 320.60] Yeah.
[320.80 → 321.08] Okay.
[321.08 → 335.08] So Colton, because he is a small, small man physically, has like...
[336.44 → 337.56] He's just...
[337.56 → 339.02] Look, he's power tripping right now.
[339.28 → 340.02] He's power tripping.
[340.24 → 340.42] Okay.
[340.50 → 342.50] He has put a gag order on me.
[343.66 → 345.30] He's put a gag order on me.
[345.30 → 350.54] He said that I can't tell people how many LTX tickets have sold already.
[351.10 → 351.22] Oh.
[351.34 → 356.54] So we did a stream a few hours ago announcing that LTX tickets were on sale.
[356.90 → 364.40] I wish the stream had been on time because by the time we did the stream, VIP tickets had been sold out for over an hour.
[364.40 → 369.88] I had comments of people telling me that they tried to buy them, but by the time they got through the capture, they were gone.
[370.24 → 371.74] And they had like bots watching the site.
[372.30 → 373.52] That's what I was saying like previously.
[373.66 → 377.76] I was like, I think the price might be a little too low because people are going to grab them too fast.
[377.90 → 379.40] But then you feel bad if you put it too high.
[379.52 → 380.48] I totally understand.
[380.76 → 386.26] Do you know how much of an asshole I already feel like charging people hundreds of dollars to come hang with me and the team?
[386.76 → 388.22] Like that feels inappropriate.
[388.72 → 389.12] No, I know.
[389.12 → 394.44] But the only way for us to slow down the velocity of those tickets would be to charge like two, three grand for them.
[394.54 → 394.60] Yeah.
[395.02 → 395.82] But it's like.
[395.92 → 397.88] But then that's ridiculous at the same time.
[397.88 → 398.00] Yeah.
[398.20 → 402.94] And then you're making it so that a lot of the people that should probably be the ones that are there.
[403.08 → 403.48] Exactly.
[403.78 → 404.60] Are not able to get there.
[404.78 → 410.68] There's no way to make everyone happy unless I set aside like three months.
[410.82 → 411.04] Yeah.
[411.64 → 412.34] And do one on.
[412.34 → 412.98] No, not even.
[413.48 → 414.20] Like not, no.
[414.20 → 415.56] Like legitimately wouldn't be enough time.
[415.56 → 419.14] So I can give you guys.
[419.56 → 421.68] So I can't tell you how many tickets have sold.
[421.90 → 423.30] But what I can do.
[423.66 → 424.54] VIP is gone though.
[424.62 → 427.14] I can write it on my dock here.
[427.78 → 429.98] And then Luke can react to the number.
[435.60 → 436.50] I can't.
[437.78 → 439.64] I can't even compare at all.
[439.64 → 440.46] No, you can't.
[440.54 → 442.18] Because compared to last year.
[442.18 → 445.16] People know how many tickets we've sold in previous years.
[445.16 → 445.60] Yeah.
[446.02 → 448.44] And like they would be able to do the math.
[451.56 → 452.96] How many are there available?
[454.08 → 454.60] Maximum.
[455.24 → 456.74] So it's a little fuzzy.
[456.96 → 458.80] It will depend on the final layout.
[459.24 → 462.58] Because the fire marshal is going to look at the layout and say.
[462.60 → 463.20] Open space.
[463.56 → 465.60] Here's how many you're allowed to have.
[465.70 → 466.06] But.
[466.28 → 468.88] The absolute maximum of that space.
[468.88 → 470.84] Assuming we put nothing in it.
[470.94 → 471.90] Is 6,000.
[471.90 → 479.84] Go buy your tickets.
[480.24 → 480.60] Yeah.
[482.22 → 482.66] A.
[483.34 → 483.90] Yeah.
[485.40 → 486.28] That's crazy.
[486.72 → 487.22] I wonder.
[487.36 → 487.56] Like.
[487.94 → 489.38] I'm sure part of its dream hack.
[489.46 → 491.30] But I wonder if it's a pretty significant amount.
[491.38 → 492.72] It's just the tone.
[493.48 → 495.16] Because like this year is going to be way different.
[495.16 → 497.92] All the office tours are sold.
[499.02 → 501.18] So the entire prior Friday.
[502.12 → 503.34] I'm taking groups of.
[503.48 → 504.92] I think it's 20 or 25.
[505.98 → 506.84] On tours.
[507.00 → 507.16] Every.
[507.34 → 509.14] I think it's half an hour or 40 minutes.
[511.40 → 512.92] And so that's.
[512.98 → 513.54] However many.
[513.60 → 514.86] I think that's like 10 tours.
[515.80 → 516.76] All of those are gone.
[516.90 → 517.74] Jayden and Will.
[517.94 → 518.96] Because you'll be here by then.
[519.04 → 520.26] You guys got to be in office that day.
[520.32 → 521.64] So Float plane can like to show up.
[521.64 → 521.90] Yeah.
[521.98 → 523.40] Float plane has to like flex hard.
[523.54 → 523.58] Right?
[523.58 → 523.78] Yeah.
[524.02 → 524.18] Yeah.
[524.30 → 524.48] Yeah.
[524.86 → 525.04] Yeah.
[525.36 → 526.70] I didn't tell them.
[527.12 → 528.68] I didn't tell them.
[529.10 → 530.14] Look Napoleon.
[531.44 → 532.74] Why did you call me?
[532.80 → 533.84] I called you Napoleon.
[534.14 → 534.88] Because I'm short?
[535.66 → 536.10] Yeah.
[536.18 → 537.48] You're like an inch taller than me.
[537.48 → 537.80] I know.
[537.92 → 539.82] I'm allowed to make short people jokes.
[539.86 → 540.98] Napoleon wasn't short.
[541.36 → 541.86] Yeah he was.
[541.90 → 542.38] No he wasn't.
[542.48 → 543.42] Well he wasn't tall.
[543.72 → 544.36] He wasn't short.
[544.86 → 546.00] Hold on a minute here.
[546.00 → 547.28] I think he was like average height.
[547.34 → 548.32] He was super.
[548.44 → 548.96] He was not.
[549.02 → 549.12] Yeah.
[549.18 → 549.74] He was not short.
[549.82 → 550.72] That was a fabricated thing.
[550.72 → 551.72] Anyway.
[552.14 → 552.88] Five foot seven.
[553.00 → 554.24] He's like an inch taller than me.
[554.44 → 555.28] But that's back then.
[555.58 → 556.30] Yeah that's true.
[556.44 → 556.66] Okay.
[556.96 → 558.22] Anyway his ticket sales are going really well.
[558.42 → 558.64] Yeah.
[559.00 → 559.36] Apparently.
[559.70 → 560.12] That's going to be sick.
[560.66 → 561.70] Yeah I know the number.
[561.94 → 562.34] Oh.
[563.26 → 564.30] That's pretty sick.
[564.66 → 564.84] Yeah.
[565.60 → 565.96] I don't.
[566.04 → 566.46] I can't.
[566.84 → 567.90] I want to give comparatives.
[568.08 → 568.46] But I can't.
[568.48 → 571.58] You can just say we've sold more today than we did all of last year.
[571.66 → 572.46] We can say that?
[572.54 → 573.02] Go for it.
[573.02 → 574.36] You weren't going to let me say that.
[574.38 → 574.76] Whatever.
[574.76 → 575.42] Just say whatever.
[575.42 → 575.76] Okay.
[575.86 → 576.24] All right.
[576.56 → 577.42] So in the last.
[577.74 → 578.60] Don't say whatever.
[580.72 → 581.16] Bye.
[581.94 → 582.80] He just runs.
[583.26 → 584.68] He just runs away.
[584.84 → 586.90] So in the last.
[587.92 → 588.42] Okay.
[588.52 → 589.50] Here's what I'll say.
[589.58 → 591.02] In the first two hours.
[591.34 → 594.28] We sold more tickets than we did last year.
[594.40 → 595.12] All together.
[596.92 → 600.00] And it's not like it stopped dead after two hours.
[600.00 → 603.14] That should give you some idea.
[603.58 → 603.78] Yeah.
[604.38 → 604.86] So.
[605.38 → 605.86] Yeah.
[606.12 → 606.40] Yeah.
[606.40 → 607.44] I'm so stoked.
[607.58 → 609.80] I am like so excited.
[610.00 → 611.38] It is going to be just like.
[611.82 → 612.92] And the crazy thing is.
[613.02 → 615.62] Even if we were to sell every ticket that we could.
[616.18 → 619.12] It's still borderline whether we would even break.
[619.30 → 619.48] Yeah.
[619.56 → 619.74] Yeah.
[619.74 → 620.88] But like.
[621.42 → 622.70] If the idea was.
[622.90 → 624.46] Let's have a crazy get-together.
[624.84 → 626.12] Of like tech enthusiasts.
[626.52 → 627.36] And tech creators.
[627.78 → 629.90] And have like a giant two day.
[630.52 → 632.00] Just like fun event.
[632.38 → 632.64] Then.
[633.40 → 633.68] Well.
[633.80 → 634.98] If more people show up.
[635.04 → 635.68] Then that's cool.
[636.04 → 636.36] You know.
[637.14 → 638.44] I'm really excited.
[638.82 → 639.60] That's really cool.
[640.72 → 642.38] That legitimizes a lot of it.
[642.42 → 643.46] Your first day of ticket sales.
[643.62 → 643.68] Like.
[644.04 → 644.32] I know.
[644.56 → 645.56] Being a buyer.
[645.72 → 646.00] You're like.
[646.08 → 646.18] Oh.
[646.22 → 646.42] Whatever.
[646.52 → 647.70] I kind of want to buy last minute.
[647.70 → 649.52] So I can make sure I do my hotel.
[649.70 → 649.90] Whatever.
[650.02 → 650.22] Whatever.
[650.52 → 651.10] It's like.
[651.32 → 652.10] My mom.
[652.42 → 654.26] Needs me to help her move something.
[654.54 → 655.36] Then I can go do that.
[655.42 → 656.02] That day instead.
[656.60 → 656.84] Yeah.
[657.40 → 657.76] But.
[657.86 → 658.30] As a ticket.
[658.80 → 660.06] As the person selling the tickets.
[660.10 → 661.18] You want to sell them all really quickly.
[661.60 → 662.28] Because then you know.
[662.52 → 663.34] That there's a lot of demand.
[663.40 → 664.52] And then you can scale up next year.
[664.54 → 665.14] And all that kind of stuff.
[665.20 → 666.40] So it's nice that you buy tickets now.
[666.72 → 667.04] Also.
[667.22 → 667.96] If you want to go.
[668.36 → 668.68] Apparently.
[668.88 → 670.24] You might have to buy them now.
[671.50 → 671.82] Yeah.
[671.92 → 672.44] So that's a.
[672.46 → 673.32] That's a pretty big number.
[673.36 → 673.86] People are saying.
[673.86 → 675.58] Maybe AMD can sponsor more space.
[675.68 → 675.82] No.
[676.24 → 677.04] I've, actually.
[677.18 → 677.54] They're done.
[677.54 → 678.84] I checked in with Colton.
[679.04 → 680.18] Even like a couple of weeks ago.
[680.32 → 683.20] Because I've seen how much hype there is about the event this year.
[683.52 → 683.92] And I was like.
[684.18 → 684.38] Hey.
[684.56 → 684.84] So.
[685.62 → 686.28] Convention Centre.
[686.38 → 687.60] Do they have more space?
[687.72 → 688.04] He's like.
[688.50 → 688.90] No.
[689.50 → 689.90] Look.
[690.08 → 690.18] You.
[690.26 → 691.22] Stop asking me.
[692.44 → 693.54] Do we have like the whole.
[694.36 → 694.52] Like.
[694.62 → 694.80] Okay.
[694.86 → 696.24] If we were doing this again next year.
[696.26 → 697.82] And we wanted to scale up in that same building.
[698.58 → 698.90] Yes.
[699.04 → 699.58] There is.
[699.68 → 699.86] Okay.
[699.98 → 700.28] Yes.
[700.28 → 700.46] Okay.
[700.46 → 703.30] Like if we finish LTX 2019.
[703.94 → 704.80] The next day.
[704.92 → 705.64] We're like.
[706.12 → 706.38] Yo.
[706.38 → 707.58] Vancouver Convention Centre.
[707.98 → 708.86] Same bat time.
[709.00 → 709.82] Same bat channel.
[710.04 → 710.76] Next year.
[711.52 → 712.16] We need.
[712.26 → 712.46] More.
[712.46 → 713.22] Double the space.
[713.36 → 713.98] Like they've got it.
[714.06 → 714.24] Okay.
[714.44 → 714.62] Okay.
[714.62 → 714.68] Yeah.
[714.68 → 716.10] They have multiple buildings even.
[716.48 → 716.62] Yeah.
[716.62 → 717.78] So we're just in like.
[717.86 → 720.46] Because it's cool to be able to scale in the same building for a while.
[720.46 → 724.10] I think we're in like three ballrooms of one building right now.
[724.18 → 724.28] Yeah.
[724.28 → 725.34] It's like a massive space.
[725.34 → 726.26] But like there's room.
[726.40 → 726.84] That's legit.
[726.90 → 727.20] There's room.
[727.32 → 727.58] Awesome.
[727.74 → 728.48] We could go for it.
[728.58 → 729.28] Very cool.
[730.04 → 730.26] Yeah.
[730.42 → 731.12] So excited.
[731.12 → 731.34] Very, very cool.
[731.34 → 733.78] On the topic of things exciting.
[734.40 → 737.72] I'm excited to have something controversial as a headline.
[737.72 → 742.58] Even though I personally don't necessarily think this is a huge deal.
[743.38 → 744.62] I think it's great.
[745.10 → 745.46] Okay.
[745.82 → 746.12] So.
[746.26 → 746.72] It's wonderful.
[746.72 → 749.34] I'm reloading on the forum posted this.
[749.34 → 749.82] Fantastic.
[750.28 → 760.24] Basically what's happening right now is user comments on your video could get your video demonetized.
[760.38 → 767.62] So a report from Wired on Wednesday claimed that videos of, okay, children in their underwear
[767.62 → 774.08] or showing their exposed buttocks and genitals are racking up millions of views on YouTube
[774.08 → 780.20] with the site displaying advertising from major cosmetics and car brands alongside the content.
[780.20 → 786.30] Now, to be clear, and you know, it's such a weird thing to talk about.
[787.08 → 791.88] Like I take pictures of my kids where their butt's showing all the time.
[791.96 → 795.54] There's stuff on the wall at my parents' house of me.
[795.74 → 796.50] I've seen this.
[796.66 → 796.84] Yeah.
[800.00 → 801.12] It's pretty normal.
[801.12 → 810.84] If it's not perverse, like, I mean, how do I, like, I, like, I, like, I bathe these children.
[811.28 → 816.42] Like, to me, there's nothing, there's nothing sexual about it.
[816.50 → 819.86] They're just my kids being cute little kids.
[820.04 → 821.28] That's how your brain is supposed to work.
[821.28 → 825.46] Sometimes they happen to be naked, and they're adorable.
[828.30 → 833.86] And so with that said, I don't, I don't upload them to the internet.
[833.86 → 834.26] You don't share them.
[834.38 → 834.48] Yeah.
[834.52 → 838.10] So my photo backup solution is one on a private server that I own.
[839.24 → 845.36] It's actually something I didn't realize when I first set up a Plex server is how great it is for photo library backup.
[845.36 → 848.82] Because not only can I check out my photos, but I can see my wife's.
[849.36 → 851.06] And before you ask, yes, 2FA.
[851.78 → 852.20] Yes.
[852.66 → 852.96] Okay.
[853.12 → 853.30] Yeah.
[853.44 → 853.86] Don't worry.
[854.98 → 855.34] Anyway.
[856.18 → 856.92] It's important.
[857.16 → 857.38] Yeah.
[858.96 → 860.54] And Plex is quite great.
[860.82 → 861.66] Plex is kind of amazing.
[861.78 → 862.54] I'm down with that.
[862.54 → 876.48] Anyway, so, so the thing is the people uploading this content might just be uploading, ha ha, a funny video of when the dog like pulled on Junior's pants and his butt was showing.
[876.48 → 892.78] But there are comments under scenes of these videos where exposed things can be seen, like where, or like where a child does the splits, like in a say, a gymnastics video, for example, or lifts their top showing their nipples.
[894.42 → 894.98] Demonetize.
[894.98 → 903.64] That appear to be from pedophiles who are documenting these timestamps for each other to find.
[903.90 → 904.28] Wow.
[904.36 → 914.20] And then effectively create, what they've effectively created is like a soft core child pornography, like loop or ring.
[916.60 → 918.54] So, right.
[918.70 → 923.94] Back to the part about how these videos are monetized in some cases by big brands.
[923.94 → 931.32] Now, obviously, if I'm Pampers, I don't think there's anything particularly inappropriate about the buttocks of a baby.
[931.94 → 932.00] No.
[932.04 → 939.64] It's literally my job to make things that go against them and keep them dry and velvety soft or whatever.
[939.92 → 940.08] Yeah.
[940.16 → 940.38] Right?
[940.98 → 943.36] And Pampers was just an arbitrary example.
[943.36 → 950.26] I actually have no idea who even, which multinational conglomerate owns the Pampers brand.
[950.88 → 952.36] Just hypothetical example.
[953.10 → 953.48] No idea.
[953.94 → 971.72] But when all of a sudden it's being twisted and deformed into something that is being, whether it was intended for it or not, used as pedophile wank material,
[972.40 → 974.42] all of a sudden, well, no, seriously.
[974.68 → 976.82] Like, do I want my brand on it?
[977.78 → 978.34] No.
[978.34 → 978.84] No.
[980.68 → 992.34] So, on Wednesday, YouTube announced that it had banned more than 400 channels and disabled comments on tens of millions of videos.
[992.34 → 997.56] So, some of the demonetized videos are from perfectly innocent creators.
[997.80 → 1002.62] So, source four here is, here we go.
[1002.66 → 1003.88] Let's go ahead and pull this up.
[1003.88 → 1005.66] Jessica Bollinger.
[1005.66 → 1005.72] Jessica Bollinger.
[1005.72 → 1009.16] My five-year-old son does gymnastics, is a happy, sweet, confident boy.
[1009.16 → 1009.66] YouTube.
[1009.66 → 1011.60] Not advertiser friendly.
[1012.30 → 1012.80] Um.
[1013.58 → 1019.30] I find the timing of this very disheartening for the YouTube community, and apparently a lot of people agree.
[1020.04 → 1020.54] Uh.
[1020.54 → 1022.04] YouTube posted an update.
[1022.04 → 1024.00] Blah-bid-bloobidi-blah-blah-blah.
[1024.00 → 1025.14] Um.
[1028.08 → 1028.56] So.
[1029.12 → 1033.98] When I prefaced this, I said that I didn't think it was that big of a deal.
[1035.06 → 1035.36] Um.
[1035.36 → 1039.14] Do you want to go first, or should I explain that probably quite controversial stance?
[1040.08 → 1040.60] Uh.
[1040.60 → 1041.44] No, you can go for it.
[1041.64 → 1041.94] Okay.
[1042.18 → 1044.26] I have stuff to say, but you can go for it if you want.
[1044.42 → 1044.70] Okay.
[1044.70 → 1059.46] So, one, I fully understand why brands would be hypersensitive to being associated with anything that is not just illegal, but disgusting.
[1059.96 → 1060.10] Yeah.
[1060.10 → 1060.82] Like pedophilia.
[1061.22 → 1061.38] Yeah.
[1061.38 → 1061.96] Um.
[1062.32 → 1073.82] And in the outrage culture of today, for them to imagine that their brand appearing next to this with those comments under it might turn off some people,
[1073.82 → 1080.22] or spark just widespread furor is not necessarily unreasonable.
[1080.70 → 1087.32] I posted a tweet earlier this week of me holding up an accessory for the Xbox.
[1087.76 → 1088.16] Um.
[1088.16 → 1089.90] I believe it's called the Accessible Controller.
[1090.14 → 1090.90] That thing's super cool.
[1091.48 → 1094.26] So, we're actually working on a review, which is why we have it.
[1094.26 → 1094.62] Oh, sweet.
[1094.62 → 1094.86] Anyway.
[1095.40 → 1095.88] Um.
[1096.48 → 1103.28] I held up a picture poking fun at this accessory because they reused the moulding.
[1103.82 → 1106.02] From the Nintendo Nun chuck.
[1107.30 → 1108.96] And I went, good job, Microsoft.
[1109.32 → 1110.88] You invented the Wii Nun chuck.
[1111.34 → 1113.66] Because it's got like a giant Xbox logo and stuff.
[1114.12 → 1115.52] People were so mad.
[1115.90 → 1118.62] They were like, how dare you make fun of disabled gamers?
[1119.14 → 1119.78] What?
[1119.92 → 1120.48] And I went.
[1120.48 → 1128.96] That's not.
[1128.96 → 1130.42] What are you talking about?
[1133.94 → 1138.70] I'm making fun of them reusing plastic moulding as a cost-saving measure.
[1138.70 → 1144.28] Like, it just, it was a purely, purely technical joke.
[1144.62 → 1150.72] Not a and it's like, look, look.
[1151.20 → 1154.10] You have to figure out who the real enemy is here.
[1154.24 → 1155.34] So, that's, that's, yeah.
[1155.46 → 1156.34] That's what I was going to throw.
[1156.34 → 1156.62] Problem.
[1156.90 → 1157.08] Yeah.
[1157.24 → 1159.64] You have to figure out who's on your side.
[1159.92 → 1160.16] Okay?
[1160.28 → 1162.38] So, this comes back to, oh man, I'm going on a tangent now.
[1162.38 → 1168.28] So, this comes back to the whole tampons versus pads controversy with the Amazon Go Store video.
[1168.52 → 1182.28] I shot an intro of that video where the actual joke is that you're a moron if you feel like feminine hygiene products are too icky to go get them for you're significant.
[1182.28 → 1184.22] That's the joke.
[1185.48 → 1191.46] But I, I, but I say it in a way that is sort of intended not to offend people too much, I guess.
[1191.80 → 1193.52] Like, I, I beat around the bush a little bit.
[1193.52 → 1208.10] So, I basically go, you know, if you are, if you are, if there's a feminine hygiene emergency in your house, and you are too embarrassed to talk to a real live human being while you go buy these things, well then, great news.
[1208.20 → 1209.40] For you, there's the Amazon Go Store.
[1209.40 → 1223.56] I'm poking fun at the idea that we are so, that we are so fragile, and we are so desperate to avoid any kind of human contact whatsoever that we need a store with no cashiers so we can buy pads.
[1224.00 → 1225.36] That's the joke.
[1225.62 → 1234.78] But people are mad at me because they're like, you are normalizing the, the, like, misogynistic view that females are gross.
[1234.78 → 1238.04] I'm like, what are you talking, figure out who the enemy is.
[1239.40 → 1241.82] So, back to this, back to this accessory.
[1242.48 → 1252.66] The actual backstory here is that I had to go buy this bloody thing, including the, the controller, because Microsoft isn't seeding them for whatever reason.
[1252.72 → 1253.44] I was like, okay, fine.
[1253.48 → 1253.82] You know what?
[1253.98 → 1254.46] Forget it.
[1254.76 → 1260.00] This is such an important product to cover, which we've actually talked about in the past too.
[1260.40 → 1260.92] But, fine.
[1260.92 → 1266.24] We're just, we're gonna, we're just going to buy it so that we can try it because people need to know about this.
[1266.32 → 1267.26] Because it's super cool.
[1267.36 → 1272.22] So, I post one tweet teasing them about reusing plastic moulding.
[1272.86 → 1276.24] And it's like, now I hate disabled gamers or something.
[1276.24 → 1280.90] I saw the commercial for it, watching the Super Bowl with my family.
[1281.06 → 1281.18] It's unreal.
[1281.18 → 1283.96] And I went on a rant about how cool it is that they made it.
[1284.30 → 1292.66] And how it's like, not a profit play, but it's like, really cool because it could really enable different people to be able to play these games more effectively than they could already.
[1292.84 → 1294.00] Super, super cool product.
[1294.00 → 1323.98] Super, super cool product.
[1324.84 → 1328.54] monetization of YouTube videos containing minors.
[1328.90 → 1332.04] So, on the one hand, I could say, you know what?
[1332.90 → 1338.52] Any video that I shoot with my son, I am his parent or guardian.
[1340.70 → 1342.08] It's my video.
[1343.08 → 1344.42] I'm monetizing it.
[1344.66 → 1345.70] That's, you know what?
[1345.70 → 1347.90] I'm going to spend some of that money on stuff for him.
[1348.66 → 1349.34] What is it?
[1349.44 → 1352.02] There's a no, there's a clause specifically for this.
[1352.02 → 1354.28] It's named after someone who...
[1354.28 → 1357.12] So I pay my kids whenever they appear in our videos
[1357.12 → 1362.90] because I think there is going to be a huge poop show,
[1363.48 → 1367.02] especially with a lot of the family vlogger channels
[1367.02 → 1370.16] where these kids who were minors,
[1370.62 → 1372.98] not under the protections and the stipulations
[1372.98 → 1376.04] of how minors in the film industry are supposed to be treated,
[1377.06 → 1379.64] where these minors are going to grow into adults
[1379.64 → 1380.66] and they're going to say,
[1380.66 → 1384.28] hey, like some of the big channels,
[1384.42 → 1386.36] there's literally millions of dollars at play
[1386.36 → 1388.02] over the course of all the years they've been running.
[1388.42 → 1391.02] Hey, where's my check?
[1391.74 → 1394.18] And no, the roof over my head
[1394.18 → 1396.84] and the food in my tummy is not payment.
[1397.72 → 1404.32] So to me, monetizing content with a miner
[1404.32 → 1408.64] who you are, let's face it, probably not paying.
[1408.64 → 1414.48] You're not paying little Johnny for the ice skating video
[1414.48 → 1415.92] that you're posting on YouTube.
[1416.10 → 1416.60] And you know what?
[1416.62 → 1419.04] There's probably not a ton of money involved in it,
[1419.16 → 1420.88] but as soon as there's any,
[1421.88 → 1424.10] there's potentially a problem here.
[1424.10 → 1429.18] So we're looking at content where minors are potentially,
[1429.80 → 1432.56] without fully understanding the ramifications
[1432.56 → 1434.90] of being present on social media,
[1435.14 → 1438.02] where minors are being monetized.
[1438.02 → 1443.24] I guess what I'm trying to say is...
[1443.24 → 1444.70] Yeah, so wait, there's a law.
[1444.76 → 1445.50] I knew about this.
[1445.80 → 1448.18] The Coggan Law, I knew it was named after someone,
[1448.46 → 1451.52] was enacted to protect the earnings of child actors.
[1452.20 → 1454.72] This is different because it's for movies
[1454.72 → 1456.24] where that child actor is paid
[1456.24 → 1457.98] and then the parents take the money.
[1458.18 → 1458.84] It's different.
[1458.84 → 1460.66] Is it?
[1460.90 → 1462.74] It's different right now,
[1462.96 → 1466.32] but it's probably going to end up covering the same stuff.
[1466.62 → 1468.66] And what you're doing is probably quite logical.
[1468.86 → 1472.90] So I guess, yeah, I guess we're just in a
[1472.90 → 1475.18] I guess we're just in a bit of an interesting situation.
[1475.18 → 1476.20] It'll happen to someone.
[1476.74 → 1479.94] I don't think necessarily that it is,
[1480.40 → 1483.42] that it makes sense for people to,
[1484.32 → 1486.52] unless they're doing everything by the book
[1486.52 → 1488.72] and employing their children as actors,
[1488.98 → 1490.30] I don't think it makes sense
[1490.30 → 1492.72] for them to be monetizing this type of content.
[1493.28 → 1494.92] So I guess YouTube,
[1495.74 → 1497.60] and I am speculating,
[1497.72 → 1499.54] I've not spoken to anyone at YouTube about this,
[1499.58 → 1501.18] but I guess YouTube is looking at this going,
[1501.32 → 1503.58] okay, we have a problem with our advertisers.
[1504.28 → 1506.06] They don't like their ads
[1506.06 → 1508.30] on anything that could be perceived as pedophilia.
[1508.62 → 1511.12] Okay, we have problem number two, our own perception.
[1511.50 → 1514.12] We don't want YouTube to be perceived as profiting
[1514.12 → 1516.44] off of pedophilia and child pornography
[1516.44 → 1518.20] however soft core it may be.
[1518.70 → 1520.58] And problem number three is that
[1520.58 → 1523.62] this has the potential to freaking blow up
[1523.62 → 1524.68] at some point anyway.
[1525.58 → 1527.12] Is this even really right?
[1527.58 → 1529.60] I think it's a distant third, to be very clear.
[1530.06 → 1532.14] Because YouTube has a lot of stuff on it
[1532.14 → 1532.84] that I kind of go,
[1532.96 → 1533.94] yeah, is that really right?
[1535.58 → 1537.52] But there's my argument.
[1537.88 → 1539.36] There's my argument for why
[1539.36 → 1543.10] I actually don't think they made a bad move here.
[1543.10 → 1546.04] Sorry, I will let you go now.
[1546.04 → 1547.70] I realize I talked for a very long time.
[1547.86 → 1548.36] No, that's fine.
[1548.48 → 1550.28] I think that's all super valid.
[1550.28 → 1550.32] I'm going to eat this jerky.
[1550.32 → 1551.54] Go ahead, you've got as long as you want.
[1551.68 → 1551.92] Thanks.
[1552.72 → 1554.06] I think that's all super valid,
[1554.16 → 1556.26] especially the part about the child actors.
[1556.40 → 1558.26] It's not the same technically,
[1558.44 → 1560.32] but I think it's going to go poorly
[1560.32 → 1561.82] at some point in time, like I was saying.
[1562.20 → 1564.50] Someone is going to be the main host
[1564.50 → 1566.06] of a YouTube channel who's a child,
[1566.44 → 1567.38] and then they're going to grow up
[1567.38 → 1568.42] and be like, where's all my money?
[1568.70 → 1570.38] And those videos are still going to be monetized,
[1570.52 → 1572.44] and they're still not going to be making money off of it,
[1572.54 → 1574.00] and there's going to be some new law
[1574.00 → 1576.90] or an addendum to the Coggan law or whatever.
[1577.04 → 1579.52] Because legally, a minor cannot actually,
[1579.68 → 1580.92] it was only recently that a minor
[1580.92 → 1582.38] could even create a Google account.
[1583.34 → 1584.88] So I pretty much guarantee you,
[1585.08 → 1586.50] most of the Google accounts,
[1586.66 → 1587.80] therefore the YouTube channels,
[1588.06 → 1590.80] that are run by kids are owned by their parents.
[1591.38 → 1591.62] Yeah.
[1592.02 → 1592.94] That makes you their employer.
[1593.78 → 1594.26] Anyway, sorry.
[1594.66 → 1597.22] Yeah, so that's going to have to be handled somehow,
[1597.22 → 1598.70] and that's its own entire problem.
[1599.06 → 1603.16] I don't think it's completely fair in the like, okay.
[1603.64 → 1606.44] We get to a problem where Google isn't the government,
[1606.78 → 1609.02] so it doesn't matter if it's fair or not.
[1609.24 → 1611.20] It doesn't matter at all if it's fair or not.
[1611.60 → 1612.58] They're a private company.
[1612.64 → 1613.90] They can do whatever the heck they want,
[1614.00 → 1615.04] so whatever.
[1616.02 → 1618.02] But if we were looking at it that way,
[1618.14 → 1620.32] which is not fair to Google or YouTube,
[1621.04 → 1623.22] but I don't think it's entirely fair
[1623.22 → 1626.48] to take these channels down or demonetize them
[1626.48 → 1629.42] when it is the complete opposite
[1629.42 → 1630.58] of the intention of the channel.
[1631.22 → 1632.12] It's not their fault.
[1632.54 → 1634.60] Some weird person on the internet likes it.
[1635.64 → 1639.12] And maybe those people should look into disabling comments
[1639.12 → 1642.46] or, like that lady actually said in her chain of tweets,
[1642.82 → 1645.80] she's very militant about, like,
[1645.88 → 1647.30] cleansing her comment section,
[1647.30 → 1649.46] so she's probably already kind of taking care of it.
[1650.48 → 1651.58] I just have a question.
[1653.18 → 1656.00] If all you're doing is removing the comments,
[1657.00 → 1660.06] are you solving the problem?
[1661.96 → 1663.58] You're solving the problem of that, like,
[1663.66 → 1665.08] network thing you were talking about.
[1665.74 → 1667.52] Because I'm assuming what the idea is
[1667.52 → 1670.56] they were going to someone's channel
[1670.56 → 1671.50] that doesn't have videos,
[1671.82 → 1674.20] and can you still search up where someone comments on things?
[1674.54 → 1675.08] Not sure.
[1675.08 → 1675.76] I don't know.
[1675.86 → 1678.56] You used to be able to go to someone's page on YouTube,
[1678.72 → 1680.06] even if they didn't upload any videos,
[1680.16 → 1682.60] and you could see their comments across the whole site.
[1682.96 → 1684.92] And I'm assuming they have, like, central accounts,
[1685.00 → 1685.72] and they go to those,
[1685.78 → 1686.80] and they see all the timestamps
[1686.80 → 1687.50] on all the different videos.
[1687.74 → 1689.16] So if you shut off comments,
[1689.16 → 1690.14] and you shut that off,
[1691.04 → 1692.64] or just make it so you can't see
[1692.64 → 1694.40] a single account's comments across the site,
[1694.46 → 1695.90] because what's really the mechanism of that
[1695.90 → 1698.50] other than stalking someone?
[1698.80 → 1700.64] But you could still consolidate all this information
[1700.64 → 1701.66] off-site somewhere.
[1701.66 → 1702.06] Somewhere else.
[1702.48 → 1704.46] And click on timestamped YouTube links.
[1704.46 → 1705.56] Yeah, that's true.
[1705.68 → 1706.20] Token asks,
[1706.36 → 1708.24] so instead of the video making money
[1708.24 → 1710.04] for the creator,
[1710.24 → 1711.02] Google just makes the money?
[1711.14 → 1713.02] No, they're pulling the advertising off them entirely.
[1713.28 → 1713.48] Yeah.
[1713.84 → 1715.40] So Google's not making money at all.
[1716.58 → 1717.02] Um,
[1717.38 → 1719.16] I mean,
[1719.26 → 1720.58] I guess what I more meant was,
[1720.82 → 1720.86] like,
[1721.30 → 1723.56] if you're a concerned parent
[1723.56 → 1724.98] seeing these comments on,
[1725.04 → 1726.66] and I'm not judging.
[1726.94 → 1728.18] Everyone's in their own situation.
[1728.18 → 1729.34] I don't know what kind of comments
[1729.34 → 1730.28] were moderated.
[1730.28 → 1732.20] But if you're a concerned parent
[1732.20 → 1733.12] seeing comments
[1733.12 → 1735.58] where pedophiles are watching
[1735.58 → 1736.96] the content,
[1737.60 → 1740.32] wouldn't the actual course of action
[1740.32 → 1740.96] be to-
[1740.96 → 1741.48] Pull it down yourself.
[1741.62 → 1742.54] Pull it down yourself.
[1743.74 → 1744.68] Or to,
[1744.68 → 1745.96] uh,
[1745.96 → 1746.52] cut out,
[1746.76 → 1747.74] or censor,
[1747.88 → 1748.96] or blur the things
[1748.96 → 1750.30] that are making people so excited?
[1750.50 → 1751.62] She was saying that her son
[1751.62 → 1752.48] does gymnastics.
[1753.12 → 1754.18] So maybe there are parts
[1754.18 → 1755.64] where his shirt comes up
[1755.64 → 1756.10] or something.
[1756.90 → 1757.32] Um,
[1757.42 → 1758.66] maybe work on getting him
[1758.66 → 1760.16] some clothes that don't do that
[1760.16 → 1762.46] or cut out the parts
[1762.46 → 1763.24] where that happens.
[1763.54 → 1764.70] But I don't think
[1764.70 → 1765.94] that all children
[1765.94 → 1767.62] doing any form of gymnastics
[1767.62 → 1768.94] should be universally banned
[1768.94 → 1769.88] across the entire internet.
[1770.06 → 1770.32] Like,
[1770.36 → 1771.62] that seems a little aggressive.
[1771.90 → 1772.04] Yeah,
[1772.08 → 1772.52] that's madness.
[1772.72 → 1772.90] Yeah.
[1773.06 → 1775.02] There needs to be some type of-
[1775.02 → 1775.18] like,
[1775.20 → 1775.84] you need to be able to do
[1775.84 → 1777.28] athletic things as a child
[1777.28 → 1778.10] and, like,
[1778.14 → 1778.94] have it be okay
[1778.94 → 1779.94] because that's ridiculous.
[1780.52 → 1780.96] But,
[1781.56 → 1782.24] as a parent,
[1782.58 → 1783.58] I think it's reasonable
[1783.58 → 1785.22] to cut out parts
[1785.22 → 1786.62] where there's clothing malfunctions
[1786.62 → 1788.94] or to just get some clothes
[1788.94 → 1789.52] that don't do that.
[1789.56 → 1790.36] That's very possible.
[1791.10 → 1791.80] So part of the issue,
[1791.90 → 1792.54] this is a great comment
[1792.54 → 1793.54] from UT Rules on Forum.
[1793.82 → 1793.94] Oh,
[1794.22 → 1794.56] excuse me,
[1794.60 → 1794.88] Float plane.
[1795.78 → 1796.12] Um,
[1796.22 → 1797.10] one of the issues
[1797.10 → 1797.82] was that because
[1797.82 → 1798.80] the comments
[1798.80 → 1800.80] were so self-referential
[1800.80 → 1802.70] and had so many cross-links
[1802.70 → 1803.30] between them,
[1803.42 → 1804.26] once you watched
[1804.26 → 1805.24] a couple of these videos,
[1805.36 → 1806.20] your entire recommended
[1806.20 → 1806.72] would be filled
[1806.72 → 1807.34] with more of them,
[1807.70 → 1808.18] which was how
[1808.18 → 1808.86] it was so easy
[1808.86 → 1809.70] to find a bunch
[1809.70 → 1810.50] of this type of material.
[1810.88 → 1811.34] So yes,
[1811.44 → 1812.30] moderating your comments
[1812.30 → 1813.82] would help with that.
[1814.52 → 1814.64] Like,
[1814.64 → 1815.40] because they have
[1815.40 → 1815.92] so many of the same
[1815.92 → 1816.72] keywords and stuff.
[1818.52 → 1819.44] So they become
[1819.44 → 1821.16] so tightly associated.
[1821.48 → 1821.86] So they would,
[1821.94 → 1822.08] like,
[1822.14 → 1823.22] put in a bunch of keywords
[1823.22 → 1824.08] and then a timestamp?
[1824.12 → 1824.78] So the algorithm
[1824.78 → 1826.12] was figuring,
[1826.28 → 1826.40] well,
[1826.44 → 1826.64] they were,
[1826.74 → 1826.86] like,
[1827.06 → 1827.58] discussing.
[1828.18 → 1828.54] Like,
[1828.64 → 1828.82] oh,
[1828.86 → 1829.42] at this point,
[1829.46 → 1830.26] there's a nipple slit
[1830.26 → 1830.98] and stuff.
[1831.96 → 1832.16] Like,
[1832.20 → 1832.52] the comments
[1832.52 → 1833.12] are really explicit.
[1833.22 → 1834.16] They're not just a timestamp.
[1834.54 → 1835.56] I thought it was supposed
[1835.56 → 1836.46] to be sneaky.
[1836.62 → 1837.98] I thought it was just timestamps.
[1838.18 → 1838.48] That's,
[1839.00 → 1839.26] that's,
[1839.32 → 1840.58] how was that not picked up?
[1841.10 → 1841.74] That seems like
[1841.74 → 1842.46] the easiest thing.
[1842.46 → 1842.84] If,
[1842.90 → 1844.14] if literally the algorithm
[1844.14 → 1845.72] can find like comments
[1845.72 → 1847.20] in order to suggest them to you,
[1847.26 → 1848.48] couldn't they just have used that
[1848.48 → 1849.40] to remove the comments
[1849.40 → 1850.22] and ban the accounts?
[1852.54 → 1853.78] It seems pretty straightforward.
[1854.06 → 1854.98] You've already got it working
[1854.98 → 1856.40] for similar,
[1856.56 → 1856.70] you,
[1856.70 → 1857.68] you literally are able
[1857.68 → 1858.88] to detect similar comments
[1858.88 → 1859.90] and suggest those videos.
[1860.02 → 1860.18] Like,
[1860.26 → 1861.28] it doesn't seem like
[1861.28 → 1862.70] a difficult next step.
[1862.70 → 1863.74] Anyway,
[1863.90 → 1865.40] I don't like the idea
[1865.40 → 1866.32] of just purging
[1866.32 → 1867.44] all those types of videos.
[1867.62 → 1868.84] I do like the idea
[1868.84 → 1870.06] of parents
[1870.06 → 1870.90] making sure
[1870.90 → 1871.24] they're,
[1871.24 → 1872.70] they're cleansed videos.
[1873.18 → 1873.66] Um,
[1873.96 → 1875.24] and maybe get your kids
[1875.24 → 1876.00] some better clothes
[1876.00 → 1876.72] for gymnastics.
[1877.34 → 1877.78] Um,
[1878.10 → 1878.30] well,
[1878.34 → 1879.28] the gymnastics thing too,
[1879.36 → 1879.52] like,
[1879.54 → 1880.00] it could just be
[1880.00 → 1880.78] that it's very tight
[1880.78 → 1881.34] fitting clothes.
[1882.92 → 1883.36] Yeah.
[1883.58 → 1884.28] And a lot of,
[1884.38 → 1884.58] like,
[1884.96 → 1885.66] the thing is,
[1885.68 → 1886.64] a lot of sports attire
[1886.64 → 1888.40] is kind of revealing.
[1888.52 → 1888.64] I mean,
[1888.64 → 1889.18] look at like,
[1889.72 → 1890.32] tennis attire,
[1890.78 → 1891.54] for example.
[1891.54 → 1893.04] Well,
[1893.14 → 1894.30] almost any sports attire.
[1895.06 → 1895.48] Hockey.
[1895.74 → 1896.40] Football pants.
[1897.04 → 1897.26] Yeah,
[1897.34 → 1897.94] football pants.
[1898.48 → 1898.62] They,
[1898.68 → 1899.86] they do not leave
[1899.86 → 1900.90] a lot to the imagination.
[1901.14 → 1901.22] Like,
[1901.26 → 1901.98] you're behind the centre.
[1902.08 → 1902.70] You know what
[1902.70 → 1904.04] that butt looks like.
[1904.06 → 1904.18] Hey,
[1904.22 → 1904.40] buddy.
[1905.22 → 1905.52] Yeah.
[1906.16 → 1906.60] Uh.
[1907.86 → 1908.60] But like,
[1909.04 → 1909.36] yeah,
[1909.42 → 1909.62] I don't,
[1909.68 → 1909.88] I don't,
[1909.92 → 1910.48] I don't think
[1910.48 → 1911.10] that should mean
[1911.10 → 1911.74] that you can never
[1911.74 → 1912.88] have a video
[1912.88 → 1914.88] of boys football.
[1915.74 → 1916.62] There are plenty
[1916.62 → 1917.10] of videos
[1917.10 → 1917.68] of my brother
[1917.68 → 1918.40] and I'm playing football
[1918.40 → 1919.18] when we were children.
[1919.80 → 1920.22] I don't think
[1920.22 → 1920.64] any of those
[1920.64 → 1921.34] are not okay.
[1921.54 → 1921.66] So,
[1921.70 → 1922.72] it's a complicated issue.
[1923.30 → 1924.50] YouTube's general policy
[1924.50 → 1925.48] for this type of stuff
[1925.48 → 1926.14] is to
[1926.14 → 1928.30] lay the smack down.
[1928.46 → 1929.20] And then let it back
[1929.20 → 1929.52] a little bit.
[1929.52 → 1930.70] And then dial it back slowly.
[1930.90 → 1931.06] So,
[1931.10 → 1931.60] that's probably
[1931.60 → 1932.22] what they're doing.
[1932.48 → 1932.66] Yeah.
[1933.08 → 1934.56] There's always collateral damage
[1934.56 → 1935.34] and there's always
[1935.34 → 1936.20] bad PR
[1936.20 → 1937.14] to go along with it.
[1937.48 → 1938.16] In this case,
[1938.28 → 1939.38] I don't necessarily
[1939.38 → 1940.62] fundamentally disagree
[1940.62 → 1941.48] with what they're doing.
[1942.04 → 1942.30] But,
[1942.56 → 1942.98] um,
[1945.04 → 1947.24] yeah.
[1948.04 → 1948.40] I don't know.
[1948.40 → 1948.72] I don't know what it is,
[1948.72 → 1949.14] I guess.
[1949.40 → 1949.42] Like,
[1949.48 → 1950.26] and I mean,
[1950.34 → 1950.74] you know,
[1950.78 → 1951.42] the thing too is like,
[1951.46 → 1952.30] that's easy for me to say,
[1952.36 → 1952.84] but what if,
[1952.98 → 1953.74] what if the only thing
[1953.74 → 1954.76] paying for those gymnastics
[1954.76 → 1956.22] lessons was the monetization
[1956.22 → 1956.82] on these videos?
[1957.78 → 1958.10] Like,
[1958.60 → 1959.94] everyone's situation
[1959.94 → 1960.86] is really,
[1960.98 → 1961.38] really different
[1961.38 → 1961.92] in their lives
[1961.92 → 1962.42] and that's something
[1962.42 → 1963.52] that we also have to consider.
[1963.88 → 1964.08] Yeah.
[1964.08 → 1966.10] one thing we know for sure
[1966.10 → 1966.98] is that Float plane.
[1967.94 → 1968.34] Yeah.
[1968.52 → 1969.70] Wouldn't be pulling content down.
[1969.86 → 1970.12] Yeah.
[1971.68 → 1973.10] Slightly more of a walled garden
[1973.10 → 1974.06] because people would have to pay
[1974.06 → 1975.20] to access that content.
[1975.80 → 1976.20] Um,
[1976.20 → 1977.60] also your comments section
[1977.60 → 1978.22] is going to be
[1978.22 → 1979.20] much smaller
[1979.20 → 1980.24] and filled with better people.
[1980.34 → 1980.42] So,
[1980.46 → 1981.14] you probably wouldn't have
[1981.14 → 1982.08] these types of situations
[1982.08 → 1983.40] in general anyway.
[1984.02 → 1984.46] Um,
[1985.00 → 1985.48] and,
[1985.84 → 1986.22] and,
[1986.42 → 1986.70] yeah.
[1987.02 → 1987.74] I think it just wouldn't make
[1987.74 → 1988.22] a ton of sense.
[1988.34 → 1988.68] It's great.
[1988.92 → 1989.62] It's great for us.
[1989.68 → 1990.62] Isn't it great whenever YouTube
[1990.62 → 1991.56] has like terrible PR?
[1991.86 → 1992.14] Yeah.
[1992.14 → 1993.28] I didn't actually know
[1993.28 → 1994.08] a lot about this story.
[1994.14 → 1995.30] I just knew it was a bad PR story
[1995.30 → 1995.70] for YouTube.
[1995.86 → 1995.94] So,
[1995.96 → 1996.16] I was like,
[1996.22 → 1996.52] yeah.
[1997.56 → 1998.00] Um,
[1998.36 → 1998.90] we also have to be fair.
[1998.90 → 1999.20] Which like,
[1999.46 → 1999.84] I still,
[2000.00 → 2000.94] I still love YouTube
[2000.94 → 2001.90] to be completely fair.
[2001.98 → 2002.64] I spend a lot of time
[2002.64 → 2003.02] on YouTube,
[2003.18 → 2003.40] but,
[2003.88 → 2004.30] um,
[2005.00 → 2005.54] and we're like,
[2005.66 → 2006.28] started your career
[2006.28 → 2006.76] on YouTube.
[2007.12 → 2007.56] Yep.
[2007.84 → 2008.62] And we're like,
[2008.68 → 2009.66] actually not competing
[2009.66 → 2010.60] with YouTube at all
[2010.60 → 2011.16] in any way,
[2011.52 → 2011.96] but,
[2012.52 → 2013.44] the better YouTube does,
[2013.50 → 2014.34] the better Float plane does.
[2014.44 → 2015.04] 100%.
[2015.04 → 2015.40] So,
[2015.52 → 2015.92] I actually,
[2016.86 → 2017.10] like,
[2017.32 → 2018.28] anytime someone's like,
[2018.82 → 2019.08] okay,
[2019.20 → 2020.34] there are two sections to this.
[2020.50 → 2021.16] First off,
[2021.32 → 2022.12] anytime someone's like,
[2022.52 → 2022.72] oh,
[2022.82 → 2023.56] someone just needs to,
[2023.74 → 2023.90] like,
[2023.98 → 2024.66] anyone out there
[2024.66 → 2025.40] just needs to make,
[2025.66 → 2025.92] uh,
[2025.96 → 2027.00] a YouTube clone
[2027.00 → 2028.26] and then YouTube will die.
[2028.56 → 2029.16] First,
[2029.24 → 2029.84] first,
[2029.96 → 2030.32] I'm like,
[2030.44 → 2030.60] well,
[2030.64 → 2031.26] hopefully not.
[2031.34 → 2031.86] And second of all,
[2031.90 → 2032.12] I'm like,
[2032.46 → 2032.60] well,
[2032.64 → 2032.78] no,
[2032.82 → 2034.02] that's not how that would work at all.
[2034.94 → 2035.88] Not even slightly.
[2036.26 → 2038.18] And it's been attempted many times.
[2038.38 → 2039.36] The reason why you don't know
[2039.36 → 2040.42] is because it didn't matter.
[2040.42 → 2044.66] What was the most recent one,
[2044.74 → 2044.94] did me?
[2045.74 → 2046.18] I think so.
[2046.36 → 2046.76] They're gone.
[2048.44 → 2048.84] Dead.
[2050.38 → 2050.86] All right.
[2050.96 → 2051.46] Why don't we,
[2052.12 → 2052.46] you know what,
[2052.46 → 2053.76] since I'm doing it already anyway,
[2054.26 → 2056.18] this video is brought to you by Savage Jerky.
[2056.94 → 2057.88] Do you want some jerky?
[2058.40 → 2058.74] Sure.
[2059.14 → 2059.94] You can't have mine.
[2060.14 → 2060.32] Yeah.
[2060.70 → 2062.04] You can have Mojo Habanero.
[2062.14 → 2062.42] Nice.
[2063.72 → 2065.66] Their jerky is made from the best ingredients
[2065.66 → 2067.08] without nitrates or preservatives
[2067.08 → 2068.46] with the goal to create a snack
[2068.46 → 2069.40] that's full of flavour
[2069.40 → 2071.06] and that isn't bad for you.
[2071.56 → 2072.58] They don't only make jerky though,
[2072.64 → 2073.58] they also make hot sauces,
[2073.68 → 2074.26] which are delicious,
[2074.80 → 2075.56] and spice rubs,
[2075.62 → 2076.44] which I haven't tried yet.
[2076.70 → 2076.96] Me neither.
[2077.30 → 2078.08] They're probably delicious.
[2078.14 → 2078.66] That's exciting.
[2078.66 → 2078.76] I'm kidding.
[2079.18 → 2079.38] Yeah.
[2080.02 → 2080.64] Which one do you want?
[2081.02 → 2081.90] You can go first this time.
[2083.30 → 2084.20] You want the herb blend?
[2084.30 → 2084.92] I don't actually care.
[2084.98 → 2085.72] Those both sound wonderful.
[2085.74 → 2086.26] This is mild.
[2086.36 → 2087.12] This is medium heat.
[2088.46 → 2089.20] Hold on a second.
[2089.72 → 2090.28] Let's have a look.
[2091.16 → 2091.98] Signature blend.
[2092.88 → 2093.12] Wow,
[2093.14 → 2093.88] they really don't say,
[2093.92 → 2094.16] oh wait,
[2094.16 → 2094.44] here we go.
[2094.50 → 2094.82] Ingredients.
[2095.64 → 2096.80] So this one is sea salt,
[2096.94 → 2097.44] garlic powder,
[2097.56 → 2097.96] black pepper,
[2098.08 → 2098.46] paprika,
[2098.90 → 2099.52] chipotle pepper,
[2099.70 → 2100.22] cayenne pepper,
[2100.36 → 2101.00] habanero pepper,
[2101.40 → 2101.64] cumin,
[2101.94 → 2102.24] turmeric,
[2102.46 → 2103.30] dehydrated lime juice,
[2103.44 → 2104.36] and silicone dioxide.
[2104.68 → 2105.58] Those both sound amazing,
[2105.66 → 2106.50] but for very different reasons.
[2106.60 → 2107.40] This one is sea salt,
[2107.68 → 2108.64] sun-dried tomato powder,
[2108.96 → 2109.20] basil,
[2109.32 → 2109.58] garlic,
[2109.80 → 2110.24] black pepper,
[2110.38 → 2110.64] oregano,
[2110.80 → 2111.06] thyme,
[2111.16 → 2111.72] crushed red pepper,
[2111.82 → 2112.20] and parsley.
[2112.70 → 2113.80] So that is pretty mild.
[2114.22 → 2114.38] Yeah.
[2115.34 → 2115.66] See,
[2115.76 → 2118.18] but I wouldn't take the herb blend one for like,
[2118.24 → 2118.52] I think,
[2118.56 → 2121.54] I think them going with herb blend was the right move because the stuff that I heard in there,
[2121.66 → 2122.70] it's not really a spice.
[2122.70 → 2123.68] That's just a
[2123.68 → 2124.16] a
[2124.16 → 2124.50] a
[2124.50 → 2125.86] yeah,
[2126.02 → 2126.80] a flavour thing.
[2126.94 → 2127.06] Yeah.
[2127.44 → 2127.66] Yeah.
[2128.08 → 2128.58] Which one you want?
[2129.74 → 2130.42] I'll go with herb blend.
[2130.84 → 2131.04] Yeah.
[2131.58 → 2131.84] Cool.
[2132.36 → 2132.84] Thank you.
[2132.92 → 2133.70] You'll find I love spicy.
[2133.86 → 2134.92] I'm legit going to use this.
[2135.58 → 2135.92] I know.
[2136.38 → 2136.98] I'll use the whole thing.
[2136.98 → 2138.64] So you can use offer code LTT to say,
[2138.64 → 2144.04] save 10% off any of their products at LMG.GG slash savage jerky.
[2146.98 → 2148.44] This video is also brought to you.
[2148.82 → 2150.10] My fingers are so greasy.
[2150.10 → 2154.62] Also brought to you by shade tree.
[2156.06 → 2159.62] Shade tree sunglasses are unique since they're made from hardwood.
[2159.72 → 2161.94] So no pair is identical.
[2162.06 → 2163.04] The wood grains are unique.
[2163.04 → 2164.60] Even between the same model.
[2164.60 → 2168.68] They come with polarized lenses that block UV rays and give you fantastic clarity.
[2168.68 → 2172.00] And if you have a screen that,
[2172.00 → 2172.56] um,
[2172.56 → 2175.46] it's polarized this way versus that way,
[2175.72 → 2176.56] like I can read yours,
[2176.64 → 2177.12] but not mine.
[2177.12 → 2177.88] Can you see that?
[2178.24 → 2179.36] I know that one's pretty dark.
[2179.36 → 2179.78] You have to turn.
[2180.10 → 2180.28] Yeah.
[2180.80 → 2181.08] Uh,
[2181.08 → 2181.64] so I'm going to do the
[2181.72 → 2181.86] yeah.
[2181.94 → 2182.06] So,
[2182.14 → 2183.48] so they are definitely polarized.
[2183.64 → 2183.82] Oh yeah.
[2183.82 → 2184.26] I was wondering.
[2184.86 → 2184.98] Yeah.
[2185.02 → 2185.38] Um,
[2186.12 → 2188.02] blocks UV rays while giving you fantastic clarity.
[2188.14 → 2188.82] Some of their glasses,
[2189.00 → 2193.58] like their half dome titanium and zebra version can be ordered with prescription lenses as well.
[2193.58 → 2200.16] They include a soft and a hard carry case, and you can get 10% off using offer code Linus at checkout.
[2200.42 → 2202.36] Check them out at shade tree.com.
[2202.42 → 2204.46] I'm not going to be able to wear these because I can't read my laptop.
[2204.80 → 2204.96] Yeah.
[2205.40 → 2205.78] Um,
[2205.78 → 2207.98] that's a bit of a problem on the Sancho.
[2208.28 → 2208.46] Yes.
[2208.54 → 2208.90] Finally,
[2209.52 → 2210.58] private internet access.
[2210.94 → 2212.66] What do I have to say about private internet access?
[2212.88 → 2213.40] PIA.
[2213.84 → 2214.52] Just go get it.
[2215.08 → 2216.56] It's like shockingly cheap,
[2216.74 → 2220.32] especially when you consider that you can log in on five devices at once with a single account.
[2220.44 → 2221.42] And if you're coming to LTX,
[2221.46 → 2222.98] it might help you with cheaper flight tickets.
[2222.98 → 2223.82] Hey,
[2224.42 → 2227.86] LEG.GG slash PIA WAN.
[2228.36 → 2228.90] All right.
[2229.00 → 2230.02] I'm having just one more.
[2230.36 → 2230.94] There you go.
[2231.02 → 2231.24] Actually,
[2231.30 → 2231.54] you know what?
[2231.58 → 2232.30] We're going snowboarding,
[2232.38 → 2232.54] right?
[2232.78 → 2232.98] Yeah.
[2233.14 → 2234.40] So I'm going to work this off.
[2234.92 → 2235.40] Bring some.
[2235.50 → 2236.32] So I can eat the whole thing.
[2236.42 → 2237.52] Jerky on the mountain is awesome.
[2237.78 → 2238.38] Mmm.
[2239.20 → 2239.42] Yeah.
[2239.82 → 2240.08] Yeah.
[2240.08 → 2242.58] Like if you take like a pit stop somewhere,
[2243.40 → 2244.24] pull some jerky out.
[2244.58 → 2248.06] I have not been snowboarding in so frigging long.
[2248.18 → 2248.74] And you board,
[2248.82 → 2249.18] not ski.
[2249.64 → 2251.40] I skied until I was like 11.
[2251.68 → 2251.94] Okay.
[2251.94 → 2253.20] And then I switched to boarding,
[2253.56 → 2256.60] but I would ski like 20,
[2256.66 → 2260.22] 30 times a year from when I was like six to when I was 11.
[2260.54 → 2263.16] And then like three times a year after that.
[2263.20 → 2265.34] So I've actually skied more than I've boarded in my life.
[2265.42 → 2265.60] Okay.
[2265.94 → 2267.38] Do you think you'll board or ski then?
[2267.38 → 2267.86] All board.
[2268.04 → 2268.30] Okay.
[2268.52 → 2268.66] Yeah.
[2268.88 → 2269.72] I like it better.
[2270.30 → 2272.32] I feel like fun to go back on skis.
[2273.06 → 2274.12] I'm also a cheapskate though.
[2274.14 → 2274.76] And I own a board.
[2275.24 → 2275.44] Oh,
[2275.52 → 2275.66] okay.
[2275.72 → 2276.98] My board is so old though.
[2277.20 → 2277.64] And like,
[2277.70 → 2280.14] I'm fairly sure the sides are like actually rusty.
[2280.14 → 2281.70] Um,
[2281.70 → 2282.96] a little bit of rust is okay,
[2283.08 → 2285.20] but you can also give it to,
[2285.46 → 2285.86] uh,
[2285.90 → 2286.18] there's,
[2286.26 → 2287.04] there's a shop there.
[2287.30 → 2287.76] And they can just,
[2287.86 → 2288.02] yeah.
[2288.96 → 2289.32] Yeah,
[2289.32 → 2289.46] no,
[2289.52 → 2289.70] I'm,
[2289.74 → 2291.54] I'm like actually kind of excited.
[2291.62 → 2293.44] It's been so long since I've been on a board.
[2293.62 → 2293.80] Yeah.
[2293.80 → 2294.94] Speaking of excitement,
[2295.06 → 2296.12] this was posted by Zed,
[2297.30 → 2298.88] Zed R Maxwell on the forum,
[2299.70 → 2301.54] the Samsung Galaxy fold.
[2301.84 → 2304.34] It was unveiled at their unpacked event this week.
[2304.46 → 2310.48] It's got a 7.3 inch infinity flex display with a smaller 4.6 inch display.
[2310.48 → 2312.14] That's used for closed mode.
[2312.90 → 2317.10] It's got 512 gigs of EMFS 3.0 storage.
[2317.22 → 2319.96] It's got a Qualcomm seven nanometre OCTA core processor,
[2320.10 → 2321.16] 12 gigs of Ram,
[2321.24 → 2321.98] because why not?
[2321.98 → 2324.62] It's got two batteries that are separated by the fold,
[2324.70 → 2328.98] but combined in the Android operating system for 4,380 William hours.
[2329.04 → 2334.52] And it'll launch on April 26th at a price of almost 2,000 US dollars.
[2334.66 → 2335.12] And that's so,
[2335.20 → 2335.36] okay.
[2335.72 → 2336.40] So US,
[2336.64 → 2340.62] so converted to Canadian and adjusted for inflation because,
[2341.02 → 2341.38] uh,
[2341.48 → 2343.18] AJ called me out when I said this,
[2343.74 → 2346.34] that phone is legitimately more expensive than my first car.
[2347.32 → 2349.36] The convertible that blew up on a bridge.
[2349.42 → 2350.96] It wasn't exactly the greatest car ever,
[2350.96 → 2354.90] but it still ran for like a fair amount of years.
[2355.24 → 2356.96] And that phone is more expensive than it.
[2356.98 → 2357.56] Like that notch?
[2357.96 → 2358.32] Crazy.
[2359.70 → 2360.06] What?
[2360.22 → 2360.48] No.
[2361.76 → 2362.12] Really?
[2364.06 → 2364.68] For a second,
[2364.74 → 2366.12] I thought you were talking about the fold in between,
[2366.24 → 2367.64] but how big is the actual notch?
[2367.64 → 2370.42] I'm pretty sure it's notch.
[2371.22 → 2371.76] I haven't,
[2371.82 → 2373.08] I didn't watch the unpacked event.
[2373.60 → 2374.24] I didn't either,
[2374.30 → 2375.46] but I've seen concept shots.
[2376.34 → 2377.12] Hold on a second.
[2377.34 → 2377.78] Where's my,
[2377.90 → 2378.16] uh,
[2378.54 → 2379.70] I hope I'm not.
[2379.94 → 2380.24] Blew up.
[2380.30 → 2380.40] Okay.
[2380.42 → 2381.82] The car didn't blow up.
[2381.92 → 2385.18] The fuel pump and fuel injectors legitimately did pop though.
[2386.14 → 2386.56] Dang it.
[2386.64 → 2387.14] What happened?
[2387.50 → 2388.50] There's a video of it on YouTube.
[2389.10 → 2390.08] Linus was making fun of me.
[2390.12 → 2390.80] He had to come save me.
[2391.54 → 2391.78] Yeah,
[2391.78 → 2392.30] that was great.
[2393.76 → 2394.12] Blah,
[2394.16 → 2394.26] blah,
[2394.32 → 2394.52] blah.
[2395.44 → 2395.80] So,
[2396.96 → 2397.72] actually,
[2397.82 → 2399.10] I'll let you go first this time.
[2399.20 → 2400.50] I'll give you my take on it after.
[2401.56 → 2403.42] I think it's ridiculous.
[2404.06 → 2404.42] Really?
[2404.76 → 2405.00] Yeah.
[2406.24 → 2407.40] I think it's very cool.
[2407.82 → 2411.24] I think it's probably one of the better implementations of this that I've seen.
[2411.56 → 2413.32] I think it's ridiculous because of its price.
[2414.56 → 2414.86] Oh yeah,
[2414.88 → 2415.62] that's a notch for sure.
[2416.24 → 2416.50] Yeah.
[2416.72 → 2417.34] I think you're right.
[2417.50 → 2417.62] Yeah.
[2417.76 → 2418.98] They really don't show it very much,
[2419.04 → 2419.24] do they?
[2419.58 → 2419.84] Nope.
[2419.84 → 2424.86] I think it's going to be very hard to not break this.
[2427.32 → 2430.52] I think the battery life issues are going to be real.
[2430.88 → 2430.90] So,
[2430.98 → 2431.18] like,
[2431.78 → 2432.20] the
[2432.70 → 2433.46] wow,
[2433.56 → 2433.68] yeah,
[2433.74 → 2434.58] that's pretty pronounced.
[2435.74 → 2437.76] I think it's going to,
[2437.82 → 2438.24] it's going to,
[2438.48 → 2438.78] whoa,
[2438.88 → 2440.10] that's very pronounced.
[2440.30 → 2440.44] Yeah,
[2440.44 → 2440.66] sorry.
[2440.66 → 2441.76] They really show it there.
[2441.92 → 2442.12] Yeah.
[2442.64 → 2443.12] Holy.
[2443.88 → 2445.34] Who would play a game like that?
[2445.72 → 2447.60] I don't really see this as like a gaming.
[2447.84 → 2448.12] No.
[2448.58 → 2448.70] I,
[2448.70 → 2448.96] I,
[2448.96 → 2449.08] I,
[2449.84 → 2452.10] batteries and phones suck.
[2452.34 → 2453.50] This has been known for a while.
[2453.80 → 2454.32] Um,
[2454.32 → 2454.58] I was,
[2454.58 → 2456.18] I was talking to Jaden the other day.
[2456.64 → 2457.00] His,
[2457.12 → 2461.78] a lot of his way older phones even now have better battery life than some of his newer phones.
[2462.28 → 2462.72] Um,
[2463.14 → 2464.40] by the time you're two,
[2464.78 → 2466.72] let alone three years into a phone,
[2466.78 → 2468.68] its battery is just trashed.
[2468.68 → 2470.44] If you use it consistently,
[2470.44 → 2471.38] like at all.
[2471.38 → 2471.98] So,
[2471.98 → 2474.72] they're going to expect you to swap this thing every one,
[2474.80 → 2476.32] like if you're spending that much on the phone,
[2476.44 → 2478.42] you're probably swapping it every year or two.
[2479.48 → 2482.60] Because if you're in the market for that expensive of phones,
[2482.86 → 2485.84] you're probably not someone who's holding onto the phone for three years.
[2486.84 → 2489.92] You're probably a power user who's cycling their phone pretty quick.
[2489.92 → 2493.06] So you're going to spend like over two grand on a phone every year,
[2493.26 → 2494.02] every year or two.
[2494.02 → 2501.30] So they say it should last for a hundred folds a day for five years,
[2501.30 → 2503.08] 200,000 folds.
[2503.22 → 2503.82] But no one's going to keep.
[2504.00 → 2504.20] Okay.
[2504.26 → 2509.04] So that's good because then the fold part won't break in the reasonable lifespan of the phone.
[2509.12 → 2509.78] So that's good.
[2509.96 → 2511.02] Or it shouldn't.
[2512.40 → 2513.30] Six cameras,
[2513.80 → 2514.74] triple camera on the rear.
[2515.82 → 2516.30] Well,
[2516.32 → 2518.08] one of them is 16 megapixel ultra-wide.
[2518.20 → 2519.66] One is 12 megapixel wide angle.
[2519.74 → 2520.68] And one is telephoto.
[2520.98 → 2523.56] A 10 megapixel camera for selfies in the front.
[2524.02 → 2526.30] And two cameras on the inside for some reason.
[2526.96 → 2528.06] On the giant notch.
[2529.16 → 2530.64] We're not sure exactly why those are there.
[2531.94 → 2532.70] Game streaming?
[2534.04 → 2534.76] I don't know.
[2534.82 → 2535.32] I'm just guessing.
[2536.98 → 2537.42] So,
[2537.58 → 2540.30] I'm going to say something that might not be that popular.
[2541.02 → 2542.04] I think this is the future.
[2543.26 → 2544.66] I don't disagree with that.
[2544.74 → 2546.02] I just hope it's not this expensive.
[2546.60 → 2546.76] Oh,
[2546.86 → 2547.14] no.
[2548.14 → 2548.82] Give it time.
[2549.68 → 2549.88] Yeah.
[2550.12 → 2550.30] No,
[2550.40 → 2551.24] yeah,
[2551.40 → 2551.88] that's great.
[2552.06 → 2552.42] Having a
[2552.42 → 2555.74] having a screen that you can pull out of your pocket that turns this big.
[2555.84 → 2556.62] That's fantastic.
[2556.84 → 2557.90] I completely agree with you.
[2557.92 → 2559.24] I don't think that's even that controversial.
[2559.42 → 2561.58] Matter of time before they'll like to fold two ways too.
[2561.58 → 2561.82] Sure.
[2562.02 → 2562.38] Heck yeah.
[2562.60 → 2564.22] I want bigger.
[2564.58 → 2564.72] The
[2564.76 → 2570.70] the like foldable paper that is digital has been like a dream thing for,
[2570.80 → 2573.70] for lots of people since my generation was kids.
[2573.88 → 2574.28] This is,
[2574.34 → 2575.26] this is not surprising.
[2575.26 → 2577.10] I don't think it is not the future at all.
[2577.22 → 2578.28] I just think it's crazy.
[2578.40 → 2580.38] This exact version is outsold.
[2580.92 → 2581.28] And,
[2581.70 → 2582.08] um,
[2582.08 → 2588.02] I think I wouldn't be surprised if part of the price point that they're doing is like trying to get sort of fewer people to buy it.
[2588.88 → 2590.86] Because they just want some of it to go out there.
[2590.96 → 2592.56] And this thing's going to be hard to manufacture.
[2592.56 → 2594.06] This is brand-new technology.
[2594.26 → 2594.38] Yeah.
[2594.54 → 2594.90] And I mean,
[2595.04 → 2597.04] they're not going to have that many of them to put it in perspective.
[2597.04 → 2605.56] The fact that Samsung is confident enough to even sell this thing is mind-blowing to me because the one that I saw at CES from that other company was terrible.
[2606.62 → 2606.72] Well,
[2606.72 → 2610.28] wasn't it Samsung that went on stage, and they showed that like terrible prototype?
[2611.56 → 2612.28] Of their own?
[2612.28 → 2612.94] The really blocky one.
[2613.02 → 2613.14] Yeah.
[2613.88 → 2614.84] I thought that was Samsung.
[2615.38 → 2615.88] Yeah.
[2616.16 → 2616.36] Yeah.
[2616.48 → 2616.70] But no,
[2616.74 → 2617.90] there's someone else that's selling it.
[2618.42 → 2619.54] That's selling a foldable phone.
[2619.60 → 2620.44] The thing is awful.
[2620.56 → 2620.94] It's terrible.
[2621.28 → 2622.28] This looks really smooth.
[2622.82 → 2624.76] The screen fold on this looks really nice.
[2624.92 → 2625.24] Mm-hmm.
[2625.40 → 2626.20] Like actually really,
[2626.32 → 2628.22] that looks like a very nice phone.
[2628.38 → 2629.76] If it was that phone,
[2629.86 → 2630.80] but way cheaper,
[2631.02 → 2631.94] it would be very cool.
[2632.96 → 2634.58] So maybe in a few years,
[2634.66 → 2636.74] hopefully we'll see.
[2636.88 → 2637.24] But yeah,
[2637.24 → 2637.54] I'm,
[2637.54 → 2639.26] I'm far from interested in this version.
[2640.52 → 2641.84] I'm stoked for the people that are,
[2642.02 → 2644.72] because you get to guinea pig test it for everybody else.
[2645.78 → 2646.92] I'd want to try it out,
[2646.92 → 2651.34] but like there's no way I would end up daily driving it at this point in time.
[2651.34 → 2651.82] I don't think.
[2652.14 → 2652.50] I mean,
[2652.62 → 2653.72] I could be,
[2653.82 → 2655.40] I could totally be proven wrong though.
[2655.40 → 2657.18] I could 100% get use out of it.
[2657.56 → 2658.72] Out of the big screen,
[2658.78 → 2659.34] all that kind of stuff.
[2659.44 → 2659.70] But yeah.
[2659.70 → 2659.84] Absolutely.
[2660.00 → 2660.18] Yeah.
[2660.26 → 2661.80] I suspect there'd be too many problems.
[2662.18 → 2663.10] The fact that,
[2663.10 → 2663.60] um,
[2663.60 → 2667.28] even new releases of normal phones have so many problems.
[2667.42 → 2668.78] Scares me for something like that.
[2669.16 → 2669.56] Um,
[2669.76 → 2671.00] but for years down the line,
[2671.12 → 2671.36] yeah,
[2671.56 → 2672.12] it'd be awesome.
[2673.38 → 2674.06] All right.
[2674.14 → 2675.58] Do we have anything else for topics today?
[2676.92 → 2678.26] Apple 2019 leaks.
[2678.26 → 2679.84] So reliable Apple analyst,
[2679.96 → 2680.56] Ming-Chi Duo,
[2680.56 → 2684.22] has released a list of suspected Apple releases for this year.
[2684.70 → 2687.88] Apparently they'll come back to the display market with a 6K monitor,
[2688.24 → 2688.50] uh,
[2688.50 → 2690.92] said to feature a mini LED like backlight design.
[2691.46 → 2691.90] Oh,
[2692.08 → 2692.44] fascinating.
[2693.10 → 2696.72] iPhones will retain lightning connectivity and will be the same size.
[2697.18 → 2699.66] Ultra wideband connectivity for indoor positioning and navigation.
[2700.04 → 2700.98] Frosted glass casing.
[2702.12 → 2703.16] Frosted glass would be cool.
[2703.38 → 2703.80] That'd be nice.
[2703.80 → 2706.84] Upgraded face ID,
[2707.18 → 2707.82] larger batteries.
[2708.08 → 2708.30] Ooh.
[2709.00 → 2709.28] Okay.
[2710.28 → 2710.64] Mac.
[2710.90 → 2713.94] New MacBook Pro between 16 and 16 and a half inches.
[2714.40 → 2717.02] And a new Mac Pro with easy to upgrade components.
[2719.26 → 2721.28] AirPods 2 with support for wireless charging.
[2722.60 → 2722.96] Um,
[2723.04 → 2723.86] iPod touch.
[2724.10 → 2724.24] Hmm.
[2724.38 → 2724.60] Okay.
[2725.04 → 2725.60] iPad.
[2725.78 → 2726.86] Two new iPad Pro models.
[2728.08 → 2728.56] Neat.
[2728.76 → 2729.32] You know what's funny?
[2729.48 → 2729.70] Yeah.
[2730.18 → 2732.20] Flow plane's probably going to have to buy a Mac mini.
[2732.84 → 2733.20] What do you mean?
[2733.20 → 2733.64] What?
[2734.92 → 2736.32] For one of its employees.
[2737.14 → 2737.54] Why?
[2737.88 → 2738.72] For their computer.
[2739.44 → 2739.80] Why?
[2740.06 → 2740.26] To work on.
[2740.78 → 2741.22] Why?
[2742.80 → 2744.34] Because they would like to work on a Mac.
[2748.60 → 2749.80] I have to buy a Mac.
[2752.04 → 2752.92] It's a Mac mini.
[2753.40 → 2753.90] You know what?
[2754.02 → 2756.30] We actually are planning to buy another Mac mini already.
[2756.84 → 2757.12] Really?
[2757.12 → 2757.82] Yeah.
[2757.92 → 2764.14] So a lot of the software for ingesting footage is either Apple only or better on Apple.
[2764.48 → 2764.84] Ah.
[2764.98 → 2766.98] So, um, the camera den.
[2768.02 → 2771.28] If we can get the issues sorted out, because so far it hasn't actually been better.
[2771.28 → 2775.78] But if the camera den figures out a workflow that's better on Mac, the Mac mini is kind
[2775.78 → 2776.20] of unique.
[2776.66 → 2779.78] It's relatively affordable, and it has a 10 gigabit option.
[2780.42 → 2780.64] Wow.
[2780.92 → 2781.88] So it's tiny.
[2782.10 → 2783.00] Also relatively affordable.
[2783.12 → 2784.28] Have you seen their RAM options?
[2785.08 → 2786.00] Well, you can upgrade the RAM.
[2786.82 → 2787.18] Yourself?
[2787.30 → 2787.58] Oh, yeah.
[2788.12 → 2788.40] Hmm.
[2788.98 → 2789.40] Oh, yeah.
[2789.92 → 2790.18] So.
[2790.18 → 2791.14] I thought it was soldered.
[2791.32 → 2791.50] Nope.
[2791.68 → 2795.20] So you throw a couple Mac minis just like on the back of a monitor or whatever.
[2795.20 → 2797.16] Plug in USB for your card readers and stuff.
[2797.26 → 2797.82] 10 gig LAN.
[2798.52 → 2803.78] It's actually kind of like we found a use case where the Mac mini really was the best computer
[2803.78 → 2806.08] on the market for what we were trying to do.
[2806.36 → 2807.34] Nice and compact.
[2807.64 → 2808.68] 10 gig already built in.
[2809.16 → 2809.30] Hmm.
[2809.40 → 2809.90] There you go.
[2810.02 → 2810.50] I know, right?
[2811.70 → 2812.84] Who would have thunk it?
[2812.84 → 2817.72] That RAM thing is actually perfect to know.
[2817.86 → 2819.08] Can you swap out the drive too?
[2819.64 → 2820.28] No, I don't believe so.
[2820.36 → 2820.50] No?
[2820.68 → 2822.06] Is it just RAM that's swappable?
[2822.22 → 2822.84] I believe so.
[2823.02 → 2823.22] Okay.
[2823.66 → 2824.12] Good to know.
[2824.50 → 2825.04] Still Apple.
[2825.70 → 2825.90] Yeah.
[2825.96 → 2827.26] It just happens to have swappable RAM.
[2827.36 → 2827.58] Yeah.
[2827.70 → 2828.04] Yeah, yeah.
[2828.20 → 2829.76] I just thought the drive was soldered in.
[2831.14 → 2832.16] That's actually really cool.
[2832.16 → 2833.64] That means Jaden can get way more RAM.
[2836.60 → 2837.44] Jaden needs a Mac?
[2838.08 → 2840.08] He's clearly doing his work on a PC now.
[2840.68 → 2840.86] Yeah.
[2841.16 → 2842.02] There is actually.
[2842.02 → 2843.62] He's been having some troubles with it.
[2843.68 → 2848.34] And it's easier for him to develop on his laptop at home right now compared to his PC
[2848.34 → 2848.72] at work.
[2849.48 → 2849.70] So.
[2851.10 → 2852.38] We'll talk about this later.
[2854.44 → 2856.60] And I think that's it for WAN Show for today, guys.
[2856.62 → 2857.06] It's your fault.
[2857.14 → 2858.58] You told me I could say your name.
[2858.84 → 2859.60] Thanks for tuning in.
[2859.68 → 2860.26] Same bad time.
[2860.36 → 2861.12] Same bad channel.
