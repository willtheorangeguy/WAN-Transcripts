[0.00 --> 2.00]  Bam done
[2.96 --> 4.54]  Whoo
[4.54 --> 6.54]  Welcome to the WAN show ladies and gentlemen
[6.90 --> 12.78]  If you have any issues viewing the stream go head over to twitch.tv slash Linus tech
[12.78 --> 18.74]  It seems to be working just fine on twitch. We have done as much diagnosis as we can
[19.50 --> 24.26]  While the stream was offline and as far as we can tell we have no idea
[24.26 --> 30.70]  Yeah, it started working on a test channel, and it looks like it's still a little borked right now
[31.26 --> 34.14]  Yeah, so that's pretty sweet. I don't know
[35.36 --> 40.50]  Yeah, so there you go. What's the bug now? It's just doing the same thing. It just hitches every once in a while
[40.92 --> 45.66]  Yeah, well it was yellow for a while at first on the test stream as well, so we don't know
[46.80 --> 52.84]  It doesn't say anything Jake hovering over it does nothing it just says okay viewers may be experiencing minor issues
[52.84 --> 57.50]  And then it'll probably turn green again. It was green while everyone was complaining last time so
[57.90 --> 61.32]  We are gonna start over we've got a great show for you guys today
[63.12 --> 66.16]  The big news I mean yeah
[66.88 --> 75.06]  Johnny Ive is leaving Apple, but it's also not the end of the world because he is going to continue to be involved okay
[75.06 --> 76.70]  Yeah, so
[76.70 --> 81.98]  Apple might be okay, I guess or I mean it depends on whether you think Apple's okay now
[82.84 --> 85.28]  So for better for work. Okay, you know what we'll talk about it more later
[85.76 --> 90.50]  Intel Intel's internal memo reveals that they are
[91.60 --> 93.60]  Impressed by AMD's progress
[94.60 --> 100.22]  Now that is high praise indeed that is for it to be in an internal memo. That's pretty high praise
[100.22 --> 105.78]  But again like I said before we killed the stream internal memos are basically just blog posts now. Have you read the memo though?
[105.78 --> 108.70]  No, no, it's pretty impressed
[108.70 --> 113.50]  We'll talk we'll talk about it. They must have are also known this was going to hit media and going to hit AMD
[113.50 --> 120.34]  Yeah, I guess I I don't understand what they could possibly yep. Okay. We'll talk about it more later. Yep
[120.34 --> 126.78]  I'm late for 2.0 spec announced and it's amazing and probably I'm assuming still won't work at good distances
[127.10 --> 134.34]  And a laser can identify people based on heartbeat at over 600 feet away, which sounds totally not creepy at all
[135.18 --> 137.72]  All that intro roll that intro boom
[137.72 --> 144.44]  Those headphones is that causing echo? I don't know
[144.44 --> 146.44]  I don't know how to turn the volume down
[146.44 --> 148.36]  I don't even know where they're plugged into
[148.36 --> 149.54]  Where are they?
[149.54 --> 150.54]  Where are they?
[150.54 --> 153.48]  Oh, they're plugged in way back there?
[159.48 --> 160.48]  Yay!
[160.48 --> 161.44]  All right!
[161.44 --> 162.84]  We got this!
[162.84 --> 168.84]  The show today is brought to you by Savage Jerky, Madrinas and Squarespace
[169.48 --> 175.96]  Oh, here comes a train. That's what we needed. Yeah, that's what we needed more more issues today. Yeah
[176.76 --> 181.80]  Perfect. That's Friday ladies and gentlemen. I will say in the amazing video that I don't know if it's on YouTube or not yet
[181.80 --> 188.44]  But the high frustrate gaming video. Yes, that actually hit YouTube yesterday. The train segment was hilarious
[188.44 --> 194.04]  That actually happens far more often around here than you guys would probably think
[194.04 --> 200.60]  I mean, it's one of those challenging things where the only place that you can find affordable commercial real estate
[201.08 --> 205.96]  Go figure happens to be next to the train tracks because nobody wants to live there
[206.20 --> 212.20]  Because nobody wants trains rolling by all times of the night and day when they're trying to sleep or gold out their daily lives
[212.20 --> 215.24]  Yeah, it's just something that we have to deal with because
[217.16 --> 220.28]  I don't even I don't even know if there is any industrial
[220.92 --> 224.84]  Not near train tracks? Not near either train tracks or like a superhighway
[225.40 --> 232.36]  Superhighway heavy trucking road. Yeah, something like that. Yeah, so anywhere where you're where you're gonna have a ton of noise pollution
[232.36 --> 236.84]  That's where you stick your commercial zoning at least here in the in the Vancouver area. So
[236.84 --> 244.44]  um, the reason the reason that it was particularly bad in that video and that it interrupted us more than it normally would like
[244.44 --> 248.92]  Sometimes we would just roll through it like right now the trains going you guys can't really hear it
[249.56 --> 252.84]  Was because in order to shoot high refresh rate video
[253.48 --> 258.92]  We had to have the bay doors open to get as much natural sunlight in as we possibly could
[259.48 --> 261.88]  That's why it was a problem interesting
[261.88 --> 267.08]  So every time you double your frame rate you lose an f-stop. Is that right brennan?
[267.72 --> 269.72]  lose a stop
[269.72 --> 275.00]  Yes, yeah, okay, so when you go from 30 fps, which is what we normally shoot at
[275.40 --> 281.08]  To 60 you lose a stop when you go to 120 you lose another you go to 240 you lose another you go to 480 you lose another
[281.08 --> 283.64]  Then you go again to a thousand you lose yet another one
[283.64 --> 286.60]  So by the time you turn something up to a thousand frames per second
[286.60 --> 291.72]  If you were trying to use the same lights that we're using right now at 30 frames per second
[291.80 --> 295.72]  You're basically looking at a dark frame. Yeah, like there's not much left
[296.36 --> 297.32]  um
[297.32 --> 299.32]  Actually, could we could we compare that
[300.84 --> 302.84]  Or could we
[302.84 --> 305.88]  Yeah, yeah, like do we have enough apertures on this camera to uh
[307.16 --> 312.76]  Just change the shutter speed. How do I do that? I don't know how to change the shutter speed. Can I just change the aperture? Which one's aperture?
[312.76 --> 314.76]  Oh
[316.92 --> 318.92]  This is great. Oh
[319.16 --> 323.96]  Hey, we got the readout on OBS so everyone gets to see that that's kind of cool nice
[324.92 --> 327.88]  Okay, so we're here. Yep. This is uh 30 frames per second
[329.40 --> 335.16]  So there's a stop so remember this is going from 30 to 60. Okay, so now we're at 120
[336.60 --> 338.52]  This is what it would look like at 240
[338.52 --> 342.36]  Another stop. That's what it would look like at 500 frames per second
[343.40 --> 345.24]  And then this is what they were recording at
[347.64 --> 353.80]  So guys to put that in the proper context it looks so bright now, uh, the on-screen display is oh, yeah, do you mind brandon?
[354.36 --> 361.24]  Thank you. So to put that in context, um, right now we're shooting with two six foot soft boxes
[361.88 --> 364.68]  In order to well look natural
[365.08 --> 370.12]  So uh, so yeah, so you basically need direct sunlight now normally when you're shooting in direct sunlight
[370.12 --> 373.80]  You would actually apply what's called a neutral density filter or nd filter
[374.28 --> 378.44]  Directly to the front of the lens in order to block out a ton of the light
[378.44 --> 386.36]  But when it's high refresh rate you're dealing with you want as much light as you can possibly get even with as much natural light as we could get
[387.08 --> 389.08]  Some of it was still
[389.16 --> 395.16]  Pretty dark especially in the upcoming mouse latency testing video that we'll be releasing in the next little bit here
[395.88 --> 397.88]  um
[399.16 --> 406.68]  People are discussing aperture oh like aperture science wait didn't jake turn monitoring off those headphones are still clearly on
[406.92 --> 408.76]  Yeah, they're loud. Can we just unplug them?
[408.76 --> 410.28]  Not a problem. Yeah, I could
[411.08 --> 416.52]  Is it around the back? Oh, sorry. I thought it was on the front. No, it's way around the back. Oh, okay
[416.76 --> 419.80]  That's kind of not great. Oh, and it's cable managed. Oh boy
[421.24 --> 422.20]  Oh jeez
[422.20 --> 424.20]  No, you know what? Forget it. I'm just gonna
[424.60 --> 425.24]  Like bury them?
[425.96 --> 426.60]  No
[426.60 --> 428.60]  Put them under your shirts
[428.60 --> 430.60]  I'm just gonna put them over here
[430.60 --> 431.16]  Okay
[431.16 --> 431.72]  In here
[431.72 --> 432.28]  Cool
[432.28 --> 433.00]  There, shut up
[433.00 --> 434.60]  Okay, sounds good
[434.60 --> 439.48]  This is the problem I run into whenever I'm not the one who sets things up because it's like it's not complicated
[440.04 --> 442.04]  It's just you know, which
[442.52 --> 445.24]  Uh, which audio source is mapped to which output
[446.04 --> 449.64]  But like if I didn't do it, I don't know exactly the way that someone else configured it
[449.64 --> 449.96]  Yeah
[449.96 --> 452.44]  And there's also hardware ways to do that with our setups
[452.44 --> 455.56]  It's like your dad setting up your home theater system in the 90s
[455.56 --> 458.12]  Like no one's allowed to touch it after it's done
[458.12 --> 463.64]  You know a lot of change anything logitech harmony remote changed my life
[464.68 --> 466.36]  because it's
[466.36 --> 469.32]  Relatively speaking once you get your ir blasters
[470.04 --> 477.64]  Positioned that's the main challenge is getting your ir blasters in all the right places so that it actually
[478.36 --> 482.84]  Consistently activates and deactivates things also. I had to contact
[483.48 --> 484.60]  Logitech support
[485.32 --> 489.08]  To change I think it was either my tv or receiver
[489.56 --> 497.08]  I had to get them to add the menu option for power on and power off instead of a toggle
[497.08 --> 504.60]  No, it was my home theater pc. That's what it was. So the only option by default is power toggle
[505.48 --> 506.60]  and
[506.60 --> 511.88]  As if any if you've ever used a universal remote before you'll know why that's a freaking
[512.44 --> 515.40]  Problem yeah, because as soon as it desynchronizes
[516.12 --> 518.84]  Every time you try to turn the system on turn it turns it off
[519.00 --> 519.32]  Yeah
[520.12 --> 523.40]  And you end up in this stupid flip-flop and you have to get up off your butt
[523.40 --> 526.84]  Which is what you didn't want to do always horrible play video games or watch tv
[527.00 --> 529.96]  Yeah, you have to get up off your butt and go manually turn it on and off
[530.52 --> 534.68]  And so so get this I complained about this they went oh, yeah, that's a known issue
[535.00 --> 538.84]  We have to go into your harmony account and add that option for you and I went
[539.56 --> 540.68]  That's not a solution
[541.24 --> 543.48]  So yes, my home theater works perfectly
[543.80 --> 549.72]  But can I recommend a harmony remote to someone else who has a media pc as part of their tv setup?
[550.04 --> 553.40]  No, I can't because that is a phenomenally
[553.80 --> 558.36]  Stupid solution to the problem that should just be an option
[558.92 --> 563.96]  Because for pretty much everything else in my setup. So I could decide
[564.68 --> 569.48]  What the activity was so so for your activity you can decide what the commands it sends are okay
[569.48 --> 572.20]  So my tv has power on or power off or toggle
[572.52 --> 578.20]  I can decide and what that's when you launch and when you end the activity you can tell it which ones to do
[578.44 --> 580.52]  But for whatever reason pc
[580.76 --> 585.40]  Didn't have that option at least when I said so as someone who never so mad had a harmony remote
[585.40 --> 587.08]  Why do you even have to tell it that it's a pc?
[587.08 --> 594.28]  um, well when you you have to tell it it's a pc because whenever it's takes the ir input which is
[594.92 --> 597.24]  uh watch pc is what I call mine
[597.24 --> 603.08]  So watch pc it then needs to blast out one after the other all the things that go with it
[603.08 --> 607.48]  So it has to say receiver fire up receiver change to this input
[607.88 --> 615.80]  Uh re and then it has to go tv fire up tv make sure you're on this input then it goes pc wake from sleep
[617.08 --> 618.52]  So it has to know
[619.24 --> 621.24]  What that code is supposed to be?
[621.24 --> 621.80]  Yeah, okay
[621.80 --> 623.00]  um, so
[624.84 --> 630.28]  It made me so mad because I was like holding my old microsoft media center remote
[630.28 --> 637.16]  I was like, okay, we have on and we have off so clearly those codes exist because some devices don't have it
[637.72 --> 639.56]  And that's just a problem on the device level
[639.56 --> 639.80]  Yeah
[639.80 --> 641.80]  I was folding a remote and I knew it worked
[643.96 --> 647.88]  So so basically if you want to recommend this to any one of the home theater pc
[647.88 --> 651.48]  You have to say buy it like before you even leave the store or no
[651.48 --> 655.16]  You'd have to set up an account you have to get home and part of the account creation process is calling
[655.16 --> 656.44]  You're just gonna have to yeah
[656.44 --> 661.08]  You're just gonna have to get now in logitech's defense the harmony support team was excellent. Okay
[662.20 --> 668.60]  Cool, but it still made me really mad that I had to talk to them to do something that I should be able to do within the menu
[668.60 --> 670.68]  Talking to anybody makes me mad. So like
[671.40 --> 673.40]  I totally hear you
[675.32 --> 680.92]  Why don't we move into like the big news this week? Yeah, Johnny Ive leaving apple
[680.92 --> 686.76]  So for those not familiar he's the bald guy with the british accent in the commercials. Yeah
[687.80 --> 690.12]  The unapologetically plastic guy. Yeah
[691.00 --> 693.64]  So he's he's their chief design or was
[694.84 --> 701.08]  Chief design officer. He's leaving the company apple announced it on thursday. So that's yesterday. Um, he's considered
[701.80 --> 705.08]  And you know, I guess it depends who you ask. I'm sure there's by many people
[705.08 --> 707.88]  I'm sure there's lots of people internally at apple who are like
[708.76 --> 711.96]  Yeah, maybe it's time to move on. You know, it depends who you ask I suppose
[711.96 --> 714.76]  But he's considered one of the most important people at apple
[715.08 --> 720.92]  Responsible for the industrial design and the look and feel of all major apple products including the ipod iphone and the mac
[720.92 --> 724.28]  Which really raises the question what do all the other people there do?
[726.20 --> 729.80]  No, I'm serious in the design department. Yeah, I'm actually serious right now
[730.76 --> 732.76]  Because they have so many designers
[732.76 --> 738.20]  Is it maybe like taking his ideas and actually creating them?
[739.16 --> 740.92]  Like does he just draft ideas maybe?
[742.44 --> 744.44]  And here's another question
[744.44 --> 749.96]  Apple doesn't actually have that many products or okay another thing okay to be fair about with apple
[749.96 --> 753.08]  Is they seem to over credit individuals really hardcore?
[753.64 --> 759.48]  Right, so that's why like this individual person is responsible for everything that happens a lot with apple
[759.48 --> 766.12]  So maybe he's the chief design officer, so maybe he ran those things for all major products
[767.16 --> 769.16]  But I have that's not the way that it gets communicated
[769.16 --> 773.00]  I completely agree, but that has been a thing with apple for a long time
[773.00 --> 775.80]  So either apple basically runs on like eight people
[776.44 --> 777.16]  yeah, or
[778.36 --> 780.04]  There's maybe something else going on
[780.04 --> 783.48]  Yeah, because this has been true for like the history of apple
[784.12 --> 784.44]  So
[784.44 --> 788.92]  Uh, anyway sure people are gonna be on me including ipod iphone and mac
[788.92 --> 794.60]  So he's worked at apple for more than 20 years and he's gonna start his own design business called love from
[795.16 --> 799.48]  With capital l capital f which i'm sure is very important extremely
[800.04 --> 804.20]  Apple will be his first client so he says while I will not be an employee
[804.20 --> 806.84]  I will still be very involved. I hope for many many years to come
[806.84 --> 809.80]  Um, he doesn't have an immediate successor
[811.24 --> 811.64]  So
[813.00 --> 813.88]  Yeah, interesting
[814.68 --> 818.28]  There's a couple of alan dye and evans hanky
[819.56 --> 822.92]  Will report to jeff williams the apple's chief operating officer
[823.48 --> 826.44]  While i've reported directly to tim cook
[826.92 --> 833.88]  There's a note in here that says i've was first noticed by returning ceo steve jobs because of his colorful design concept of the imac
[834.44 --> 837.72]  So was he the like carry it by the handle colorful?
[838.28 --> 845.40]  Transparent imac guy if I recall correctly. Yes, that makes sense in terms of timeline. Yeah, gosh, i'm old
[846.12 --> 848.12]  Okay, no
[848.92 --> 853.16]  So anyway, that's both a big deal and then also sort of a nothing burger just because
[853.64 --> 855.32]  um
[855.40 --> 861.64]  He's still gonna work with apple. He's just hot take. I don't think they've had very inspiring design for a while
[861.64 --> 864.52]  Well, okay, so this is where I
[865.64 --> 867.64]  Okay, so this is where oof
[868.92 --> 870.92]  It gets kind of um
[872.44 --> 873.72]  So I say a lot
[875.32 --> 876.36]  That I feel like
[877.48 --> 882.20]  Apple products are designed for people who don't have a lot to do
[883.48 --> 889.16]  Um, so if you look okay, hold on yeah quick pause sure when's that competition happening?
[889.16 --> 893.08]  Uh, oh, uh, not for a few weeks. I think okay
[893.48 --> 897.16]  Yeah, so that what he's referring to is the editing showdown
[897.16 --> 904.28]  Uh, jonathan morrison from tld is going to be coming up here to compete in an editing showdown with our very own
[904.68 --> 905.72]  Taron van hemert
[905.72 --> 909.40]  That was just obvious like you guys should have a like quick
[910.20 --> 914.76]  Hot takes about the other platform thing before the competition like independently
[914.76 --> 920.92]  So Taron and jonathan will make their own comments, but I am not there to editorialize
[921.64 --> 926.12]  I will be mostly hosting the showdown. Oh cool. That's okay
[926.36 --> 929.32]  We also are working on a panel of celebrity judges
[929.80 --> 936.04]  Okay, uh, i'm not going to comment on their status yet because I don't want there to be any like pressure on them or anything
[936.04 --> 941.48]  But I have certainly reached out for the premiere side of things. We we wanted a panel of four judges
[941.48 --> 945.88]  Uh, two that are more steeped in final the final cut ecosystem
[945.88 --> 953.80]  Okay, and two that are more premiere folks. Okay, and so I have reached out to eber from hardware canucks as well as
[954.52 --> 957.16]  Nico from the corridor digital crew. Oh cool
[957.88 --> 963.00]  And I have received receptive responses from both but neither of them are confirmed. Okay
[963.00 --> 968.60]  So I would love to have them on our panel of celebrity judges, but it's always complicated
[968.60 --> 972.28]  Coordinating people with such busy schedules. Oh, yeah here in the studio. Yeah
[972.28 --> 976.36]  Yeah, you know creators are difficult to wrangle it really and I don't blame them at all
[976.36 --> 978.36]  I totally get it because my schedule is
[979.16 --> 982.84]  Stupid yeah, I literally have no idea when he's in the country or not
[983.16 --> 990.12]  Okay, so back to my back to my point about apple products seemingly being designed for people who don't have a lot to do
[990.36 --> 993.32]  Um, have you ever used apple's calendar app?
[994.52 --> 997.00]  No, it's utterly worthless. Genuinely like you just
[997.00 --> 1002.36]  You just google calendars great. You can't even google calendar. Okay, so yeah, that's good
[1002.44 --> 1010.12]  So even google calendar compared to there's a third party app called business calendar. That's only available for android. It's not available on ios
[1010.92 --> 1012.92]  and it is
[1013.00 --> 1015.00]  full beast mode like
[1015.48 --> 1021.72]  Tiny text you can configure it this way you can have like tiny text so you can actually read everything
[1021.72 --> 1028.20]  And you can actually tell what the hell you're looking at meeting coordination in google calendar is fantastic though
[1028.20 --> 1033.48]  Yes, so that's the main thing. I like using it for apple's calendar app by comparison
[1034.12 --> 1039.40]  Simply has no way to configure it with the same degree of display density
[1039.40 --> 1043.16]  Okay, so it seems to make the assumption that you either
[1043.80 --> 1048.52]  Don't have a lot on your plate or you have all the time in the world to drill down and look at things
[1048.52 --> 1054.12]  Oh, you mean like okay, I thought you meant in terms of one like you want to be able to read everything of one task
[1054.12 --> 1059.16]  But you mean you can read your entire day by making it all really sure you can read the entire month
[1059.88 --> 1067.08]  Like all the agenda items for that day from the month view on this business calendar app and it's just it's a whole other level like
[1067.56 --> 1067.96]  um
[1067.96 --> 1071.08]  I I was telling yvonne because she had issues with
[1071.64 --> 1074.44]  She had some issues with android because let's face it. There's some issues with android
[1074.44 --> 1079.08]  Yeah, um, she had some issues with android and I said look why don't you try an iphone for a bit and she tried it
[1079.08 --> 1081.08]  And she was like this is completely unusable
[1081.40 --> 1086.52]  Because there isn't a replacement she tried every calendar app for ios also really annoying
[1087.00 --> 1091.72]  I have to carry one now and it won't stop yelling at me about apple pay
[1092.44 --> 1096.28]  Yeah, yeah, I know right and like everything else. It's like hey, you should use this feature
[1096.28 --> 1100.44]  I'm gonna pop up 10 million times. I don't want this to turn into a rant about ios. Yeah, but
[1100.44 --> 1108.44]  If you don't have a sim in it, there's no way to disable that. Hey, there's no sim installed. I know you're an ipod right now
[1108.44 --> 1110.44]  Okay, I don't care
[1111.32 --> 1118.28]  But it can't butter deal with it cannot handle that it's like no. I am iphone. Yeah, I am a phone. Where is your sim card?
[1118.52 --> 1120.52]  I deserve a sim card
[1121.80 --> 1123.80]  I was born with sim card privilege
[1124.60 --> 1128.44]  So yeah, oh, yeah, look at this asteroid week says
[1128.44 --> 1133.72]  Um, or asteroid says week mode in business calendar is the best
[1134.68 --> 1137.16]  uh, yeah, yeah, pretty much is so so anyway, so
[1138.28 --> 1147.00]  I I end up I end up with this sort of observation almost every time I go to use an apple product because the amount of
[1147.64 --> 1150.68]  sort of manual drilling down of things
[1151.24 --> 1152.36]  um
[1152.36 --> 1158.60]  Just annoys me and you know what ipad os looks like it's going to address a lot of my complaints
[1158.84 --> 1163.08]  About ios on a large screen device ipad has been very interesting lately
[1163.72 --> 1164.44]  I
[1164.44 --> 1167.96]  Apple seems determined to resurrect this sort of
[1169.16 --> 1173.08]  I won't say failing but I will say stumbling business unit
[1173.08 --> 1178.28]  They've had a really hard time convincing anyone who already has an ipad that they should get a new one
[1178.92 --> 1183.80]  And that's been my I still the only tablet in my house is an ipad 2
[1184.52 --> 1187.64]  Because a lot of the things you're going to do with it doesn't really matter
[1188.44 --> 1194.20]  You can still do it just be fine put the kids in front of it when I need a break. That's basically its only job
[1194.20 --> 1198.20]  You entertain the young ones
[1198.76 --> 1202.28]  Like and the thing too is that I don't even use it for that that often
[1202.52 --> 1208.76]  But it's still perfect for that because it's an ipad so you leave it for two weeks and the battery is still alive
[1209.08 --> 1211.72]  You can never do that with an android tablet. Yeah
[1212.76 --> 1217.88]  And so the very occasional time that I use it it's ready to rock and I can go take a nap
[1219.80 --> 1223.08]  It's the nap machine the nap machine this machine creates the eye nap
[1224.04 --> 1225.96]  That would actually be an adorable commercial
[1227.56 --> 1229.48]  They would never do that
[1229.48 --> 1234.92]  Apple's marketing collateral is all about what a creative intellectual person their product turns you into
[1234.92 --> 1236.44]  It's not about like getting a rest
[1236.44 --> 1239.24]  It would be cool if they just named it like a million different things
[1239.24 --> 1242.60]  And they could even go back to that like put the eye there and then rotate the word
[1243.32 --> 1245.08]  And they could like like for this person
[1245.08 --> 1248.12]  It's the eye nap and it creates naps for them for someone else
[1248.12 --> 1252.20]  It's like the I create and they can throw that yeah crap in and then for someone else
[1252.20 --> 1256.84]  It's it's I game whatever I feel like that could be actually kind of entertaining
[1256.84 --> 1260.04]  They would never do it they would never do it
[1260.04 --> 1262.28]  Speaking of things I thought they would never do
[1262.28 --> 1266.36]  Intel internal memo reveals they're impressed by AMD's progress
[1266.36 --> 1267.72]  Yeah, this is kind of hilarious
[1267.72 --> 1268.36]  This is wild
[1268.36 --> 1273.56]  So, uh, i'm gonna try and bring up the actual memo because it's freaking awesome
[1273.56 --> 1277.80]  Okay, yeah here it is on tech power up if you guys want to read the whole thing make sure you head over there
[1278.36 --> 1279.56]  Um, but basically
[1280.20 --> 1281.32]  Here we go
[1281.32 --> 1285.96]  We are now entering the latest chapter of the tech industry single long-running business rivalry
[1286.04 --> 1291.08]  Intel and AMD have been competing for many of the same chip customers for more than 50 years. Oh wait. No, this is dang it
[1291.08 --> 1293.08]  This is tech power-ups introduction
[1293.32 --> 1297.00]  Where's uh, Intel's thing following and these blah blah. Oh, here it is
[1297.32 --> 1305.00]  Why AMD is now a formidable competitor? Wow was actually that alone a subheading in the internal memo
[1305.00 --> 1309.08]  That alone is huge, right? Oh, man. So they basically go. Yeah
[1309.08 --> 1312.84]  They've had two years of greater than 20% annual revenue growth
[1313.32 --> 1320.04]  Thanks basically to ryzen and epic and then they pretty much attribute it not entirely
[1320.04 --> 1325.24]  But a big part of it to the strategic refocus on premium high performance products
[1325.88 --> 1327.16]  now
[1327.16 --> 1330.52]  I do have to look at that and go. I feel like it's a little bit
[1331.24 --> 1333.24]  Oversimplified and or even misleading
[1333.80 --> 1337.80]  I'm sure if AMD could have built high performance products five years ago. They would have
[1339.08 --> 1343.24]  They just had nothing. Yeah, like they had straight up
[1344.28 --> 1350.92]  Nothing like until right now. Oh, I mean, it's not like it's not like zen doesn't scale down to low performance products
[1350.92 --> 1354.04]  They can do a quad core processor if they want. Yeah
[1354.04 --> 1359.96]  I mean, okay back to a particularly dark time in amd's history. They could build a tricore processor
[1360.04 --> 1362.76]  They really wanted to yeah, they just
[1362.76 --> 1366.76]  Don't that was awkward. They're not stuck making
[1367.48 --> 1372.20]  Just that like it scales down just fine. The issue was they just had
[1373.24 --> 1375.24]  nothing
[1375.32 --> 1378.68]  Anyway, back to back to the art and back to the memo though
[1379.48 --> 1382.68]  So key amd competitive threats are from high-end products
[1383.24 --> 1386.44]  I also think that's kind of that's kind of another funny one because
[1387.00 --> 1389.80]  What do you mean by high-end products?
[1390.12 --> 1396.20]  Specifically the key amd threat is across your entire product stack all the way from like
[1396.92 --> 1402.52]  100 to 200 dollar cpus which last I checked is pretty low end. Yeah all the way to
[1403.64 --> 1407.88]  Many core data center products, which yes is a high-end product
[1408.44 --> 1409.32]  um
[1409.32 --> 1415.80]  Maybe what they're referring to here specifically was amd's focus on ap use because that was the whoops
[1416.68 --> 1421.56]  Amd's focus on ap use because that was the only thing that they could build that had competitive performance
[1421.96 --> 1427.40]  And only because their onboard graphics were so much better than intel's not because the cpu cores were competitive
[1427.96 --> 1432.52]  Maybe that's what they mean by this but like I think again, that's um
[1433.72 --> 1439.96]  A little misleading because almost everything intel's built in the last few years on the consumer side is an apu by amd's definition
[1440.12 --> 1443.56]  Yeah, the height of the apu war was kind of a pretty weird time
[1443.56 --> 1449.08]  It was a very weird time because everyone wanted to like I think people wanted to support amd
[1449.24 --> 1452.44]  So everyone would flex the apu gpu performance
[1452.44 --> 1457.88]  Yeah, and then no one would run it that way because it wasn't really good enough for almost anything
[1458.44 --> 1461.40]  So really awkward time. Hi, what can I do for you?
[1462.92 --> 1465.96]  Uh, I didn't how badly do you need them?
[1465.96 --> 1470.68]  No, we can get that next week. We can get that next week. Yeah cool
[1472.12 --> 1473.64]  Cool, thanks ed
[1475.00 --> 1479.56]  Um, okay, so let's let's have a look at uh some of the other some of the other subheadings here
[1480.36 --> 1480.68]  So
[1481.48 --> 1486.28]  Man, this like this is like a scary time to be intel like I can see why they're sending out this memo
[1486.28 --> 1492.68]  It's like look guys we have to acknowledge this stuff amd has recently been gaining some traction and winning public cloud offerings
[1492.68 --> 1494.68]  Oh
[1494.76 --> 1496.60]  That's a pretty big deal
[1496.60 --> 1507.24]  Yeah, um amd's upcoming next generation's end core products codename rome for servers and matisse for desktop will intensify our desktop and especially server competition
[1509.00 --> 1511.00]  Intensify the forward firepower
[1513.56 --> 1517.96]  The latter is likely to me the most intense in about a decade
[1517.96 --> 1523.88]  Which is another way of saying amd had nothing for 10 years. Yeah, and it's true
[1524.28 --> 1525.56]  um, okay
[1527.00 --> 1533.96]  I mean they're even acknowledging the notebook and the notebooks and business pc competition. That's incredible
[1535.08 --> 1536.12]  um
[1536.12 --> 1541.72]  Now this is again sort of misleading by leveraging tsmc seven nanometer manufacturing
[1542.12 --> 1544.68]  AMD no longer manufactures its own chips. They got to get that in there
[1544.68 --> 1548.60]  AMD can drive higher and higher performance
[1549.40 --> 1550.04]  um
[1550.04 --> 1552.92]  Now they they acknowledge it later on in the memo
[1553.00 --> 1559.88]  But that's not really the main reason that amd is able to drive higher core counts and yeah, not at all performance
[1560.60 --> 1564.20]  Yes global foundries did stumble we know this
[1565.00 --> 1566.44]  but um
[1566.44 --> 1570.36]  AMD wasn't on tsmc's seven nanometer node for ryzen gen 1
[1571.00 --> 1574.92]  And ryzen gen 1 was a return to competition
[1575.40 --> 1579.80]  Um really it just has more to do with amd's modular approach to their core design
[1579.88 --> 1583.48]  That is a big part of the reason that amd can drive higher core counts
[1583.64 --> 1586.68]  And amd's been driving higher core counts than intel for a couple of years now
[1587.96 --> 1593.72]  The big thing that's happening now is the ipc improvements with zen 2 that are making these
[1594.52 --> 1599.24]  Many core desktop processors now competitive even in single threaded tasks
[1599.88 --> 1606.76]  Allegedly this is all still based on amd data and or leaks. What can I do for you? Oh, yes, uh, here's a prompter remote
[1606.76 --> 1607.72]  Thank you, dennis
[1607.72 --> 1611.08]  so one thing that I think is kind of going on in parallel to this is
[1611.72 --> 1613.72]  Intel's community
[1613.96 --> 1618.84]  Communication and marketing whatever you want to call it. Um, not necessarily pr to
[1619.80 --> 1625.32]  The masses because they seem to be pretty on top of at the very least communicating with enterprise level stuff
[1625.32 --> 1627.24]  Right, um, but enterprise level stuff
[1627.96 --> 1633.56]  Other than trust in terms of it will work doesn't really care that much. Nope
[1634.36 --> 1639.88]  They'll use because a lot of these so the thing that you guys got to understand is for a consumer
[1640.68 --> 1645.40]  They buy something with the expectation that it has already been validated for them
[1646.12 --> 1652.68]  If you're designing a supercomputer like if we were to go to the very very high end of the enterprise space
[1653.00 --> 1655.56]  If you're designing a supercomputer you are
[1656.44 --> 1658.04]  In some ways
[1658.04 --> 1660.36]  Expecting the hardware to have problems
[1660.92 --> 1668.52]  And you are expecting that you are that you are engineering a solution around them as part of your design process
[1668.52 --> 1671.88]  That's the reason why you'll see the latest supercomputer
[1672.52 --> 1681.32]  spinning up when there's literally a generation newer hardware available to consumers or to the smb market or whatever the case may be
[1681.32 --> 1685.40]  Because that design process happened, you know 18 to 24 months ago
[1685.96 --> 1690.68]  Um, so yes, they get early access to the hardware so that they can work on this design
[1691.16 --> 1695.48]  But there's there's only like there's only so much you can do like the silicon's just not finished yet
[1695.48 --> 1701.72]  Um, yeah, but I think I think I noticed something so I I went to a lot of conventions
[1702.12 --> 1707.16]  I would go to PAX is like crazy and all this kind of stuff and intel started doing something where they pulled out of conventions
[1707.64 --> 1711.16]  Yeah, it was in conventions. Yeah for a very very long
[1711.16 --> 1714.12]  They were huge at PAX up until like a couple years ago. I think yeah
[1714.12 --> 1718.36]  And intel was like at the start of PAX and intel was a big deal there
[1718.36 --> 1725.40]  And they held a big deal position for a very long time and their booth kind of shranked and eventually it became a little bit less
[1725.72 --> 1730.84]  Experiential and check out our crazy products and it became look at our partners products and stuff like that
[1730.84 --> 1734.68]  But it was still there. It was still really interesting. It still brought actually a lot of people in
[1735.48 --> 1738.76]  Compared to many booths on the floor that were hardware based they were very active
[1738.76 --> 1742.20]  I know like Corsair was really active and stuff too, but they were very active
[1742.52 --> 1745.56]  Um, and then an AMD didn't really exist
[1746.52 --> 1748.04]  AMD was not what are you doing?
[1748.04 --> 1752.52]  I'm spamming twitch.tv slash linus tech in the chat because people are complaining about the leg
[1752.92 --> 1756.92]  We don't know what the issue is, but it's something to do with youtube. Um
[1757.72 --> 1759.64]  But then again, it's happening on float plane too
[1760.12 --> 1766.04]  So for whatever reason our stream is perfect on twitch. Just go over the actually most confusing part is that it is working on twitch
[1766.28 --> 1769.40]  But yeah, that's cool. So here we go. Uh, but yeah, so
[1769.40 --> 1774.68]  Right around when intel who had this like literally complete market share
[1774.76 --> 1778.20]  Although there's only two of them for processors showing up at conventions
[1778.76 --> 1786.52]  They disappear amd shows up and amd show that that was literally the most perfect timing for amd and the worst timing for intel ever
[1786.84 --> 1793.48]  Because intel loses this like and I know roi on conventions is like ridiculous and terrible and hard to track
[1793.80 --> 1797.08]  But don't talk too much about that though. We have our own convention now. Yeah
[1797.08 --> 1800.28]  Yeah, but to tie into that convention
[1801.00 --> 1803.00]  The sentiment you get from those people
[1803.32 --> 1805.48]  Yeah, and these are influence really strong
[1805.72 --> 1809.16]  Yeah, and then they're gonna go talk to their friends and they're gonna talk on forums. They're gonna do everything else
[1809.32 --> 1814.84]  So it spreads out like crazy and when you can have that interaction as a hardware company in person
[1814.84 --> 1817.80]  Which you almost never have it's super valuable
[1817.80 --> 1821.72]  And that doesn't mean that intel not showing up all of a sudden generates negative sentiment
[1821.72 --> 1825.56]  Like it's not that simple but intel loses their opportunity
[1826.12 --> 1828.60]  To say, you know, hey, we're good too
[1829.00 --> 1833.72]  Right around the time that amd is coming in banging this we're awesome right now drum
[1834.20 --> 1836.20]  We're super awesome. Check it out
[1836.20 --> 1845.32]  And like amd shows up with crazy booths now that are really interesting. They're doing giveaways they have like their booths are banging and they show up out of nowhere
[1845.96 --> 1850.36]  It's it's just really it's and that seems to be happening not just at the convention level
[1850.36 --> 1855.08]  That's somewhere where it's extremely tangible. You can see it happen intel disappeared
[1855.40 --> 1858.92]  amd showed up and they completely took over the convention space
[1859.00 --> 1863.16]  I've been asked as a long time intel user by uh
[1863.16 --> 1866.76]  I forget whether it was over twitter on our forum or something. I but i've been asked
[1867.32 --> 1870.04]  Would you consider an amd chip for your next rig?
[1870.04 --> 1872.52]  And I was like, yeah, of course
[1873.40 --> 1879.80]  Like the only reason that i'm not running amd now is that it isn't the highest performance solution right now
[1881.16 --> 1886.12]  Because the thing is and I don't want like this is not this is not a flex thing. This is not like
[1886.84 --> 1889.96]  Trying to rub it in or anything like that, but I am not
[1890.68 --> 1893.32]  Budget constrained for my computer
[1893.80 --> 1896.92]  So I have I've had a lot of people ask me over the last couple years
[1896.92 --> 1899.72]  Well amd is competitive. Why are you still running intel?
[1900.52 --> 1902.52]  Because it's faster
[1905.00 --> 1911.16]  It might not be the best option if you're building different price to your computers exactly so depending on what kind of a price point you're targeting
[1911.80 --> 1917.96]  Yeah, amd might make a ton of sense and i've recommended amd plenty but no, I haven't been using it because
[1918.76 --> 1920.28]  Why would I?
[1920.28 --> 1923.00]  Well, that looks like it might change so
[1923.56 --> 1927.16]  Depending on how our evaluation of ryzen third gen goes
[1927.72 --> 1934.36]  Yeah, it's very possible like people people treat me like i've never had an amd computer
[1934.84 --> 1940.76]  You know what just for fun i'm gonna try and list out all the processors i've ever run. Oh, I can't remember this
[1940.76 --> 1943.16]  Every time you do this i'm like I have no idea what I had
[1943.16 --> 1947.80]  It's gonna be really hard. Okay, so the first cpu I ever owned was a pentium 90
[1947.80 --> 1955.16]  Like this was my personal tower. I inherited it from my uncle. It was a pentium 90 in like the early 2000s. So it was like
[1956.60 --> 1960.52]  Pretty slow. Yeah, okay, so then the first rig I ever built for myself
[1962.28 --> 1969.32]  Athlon xp 2500 plus heck yeah bought me that 2500 plus baby then I got a 2500 plus mobile
[1969.64 --> 1973.24]  Because it overclocked a little better overclocked that thing to 3200 plus
[1973.88 --> 1974.92]  But guys
[1975.88 --> 1977.00]  amd fans
[1977.00 --> 1981.16]  Speaking from the heart for heart to heart here. Okay, we were deluding ourselves
[1981.40 --> 1986.36]  If we thought that a 3200 plus was actually equivalent to a 3.2 gigahertz northwood sea, okay
[1986.76 --> 1992.44]  It was not that was not a thing that was real two percent of the audience understand what's going on next cpu was
[1992.60 --> 1992.92]  um
[1992.92 --> 1994.92]  I believe it was a
[1995.16 --> 1996.20]  claw hammer
[1996.20 --> 1998.20]  I want to say it was a
[1999.32 --> 2002.28]  3200 plus it was the one with less cash
[2003.08 --> 2004.12]  um
[2004.12 --> 2007.24]  Was it or was it north something shoot?
[2008.20 --> 2009.88]  Okay, so no no no
[2009.88 --> 2011.88]  Get get get go on get out of here
[2012.84 --> 2014.84]  No, no
[2014.84 --> 2022.84]  Okay, so sledgehammer was fx only and then uh claw hammer was the single core whatever it was a socket 754
[2022.84 --> 2028.12]  single core athlon 64 it was a huge upgrade and the reason that I went to that
[2028.52 --> 2033.64]  Was because at the time games were predominant basically exclusively single threaded
[2033.88 --> 2037.32]  So hyper threading while it was nice for your overall system responsiveness
[2037.56 --> 2041.48]  Did not make a difference for games and games was 90 plus percent of what I did on my rig
[2041.72 --> 2043.72]  So I picked up an athlon 64 single core
[2044.12 --> 2046.44]  Okay, my next upgrade was to socket 939
[2046.44 --> 2053.00]  939 and the reason that I had to go from 754 to 939 I was super pissed off like that's another thing
[2053.32 --> 2058.92]  AMD fans are so quick to appointed intel for retiring their you know their motherboard chipsets
[2059.48 --> 2060.28]  so
[2060.28 --> 2067.08]  Frequently and making you buy a new motherboard. It's like don't don't imagine for a second that amd's hands are clean in all of this either
[2067.64 --> 2071.96]  Socket 754 lasted for like 10 months or something stupid like that
[2071.96 --> 2075.88]  I can't remember what it was and 940 on the desktop was even worse
[2076.52 --> 2082.36]  So I went to socket 939 and picked myself up. This was the most expensive cpu I ever bought for myself
[2082.36 --> 2086.68]  It was a 4400 plus and the reason I went for that was because it was the first
[2087.08 --> 2091.80]  Consumer dual core processor not counting like I don't even know was it titanium multi-core?
[2091.80 --> 2094.68]  I don't know it doesn't matter the point was it was the first
[2095.08 --> 2097.56]  Dual core processor that you could buy for the desktop
[2097.56 --> 2102.44]  It was the full one meg cache was it one meg per core or one meg can't remember
[2103.24 --> 2105.24]  compared to the
[2105.24 --> 2109.80]  4200 plus which had less cash so that meant that with overclocking you could get full
[2110.36 --> 2116.20]  4800 plus performance which was other than the fx line which was basically dumb because it was just an overclocked
[2117.16 --> 2123.72]  The other thing so other than the fx line it was the fastest consumer chip you could get so from my 4800 plus
[2123.72 --> 2130.36]  What did I go to? I got an optron 165. Are you noticing a pattern here?
[2131.00 --> 2136.60]  Noticing a pattern a lot of AMD. Well AMD isn't that funny? Most of my growth was on AMD chips as well
[2136.60 --> 2141.48]  So I got an optron 165 and the reason for that was it overclocked slightly better that was around the same time
[2141.48 --> 2143.72]  I picked up as rocks very unique
[2144.20 --> 2144.68]  uh
[2144.68 --> 2145.80]  AGP and
[2145.80 --> 2151.00]  PCI express board because I had an AGP card at the time and I wanted to move to PCI express later cool
[2151.00 --> 2157.80]  It was a great overclocking board shockingly other than the fact that you couldn't run one t on your memory timings no matter what you did
[2157.80 --> 2159.80]  I tried everything
[2160.04 --> 2163.96]  All right from there. I went to the e6600
[2164.76 --> 2171.32]  Now, why would I do that? Well because conroe was a performance revolution. It was a complete game changer
[2171.40 --> 2176.20]  It absolutely curb stomped the aging athlon 64 and AMD
[2176.20 --> 2181.96]  And it didn't catch up so from there I went to q6600 from there. I went to q
[2182.92 --> 2185.72]  9650 very temporarily
[2186.28 --> 2188.28]  I borrowed that one from work
[2188.68 --> 2193.72]  Um, I think it was a qx 9650. Excuse me borrowed that one from work delitted that
[2193.72 --> 2196.92]  I believe I was the first person to ever deal at a qx 9650
[2196.92 --> 2200.12]  You deleted a work thing? Don't worry about it. Oh, um
[2200.12 --> 2208.12]  Interesting from there. I picked up a core i7 920 man. That was a beast of a chip got myself
[2208.12 --> 2211.00]  Uh, this was right around the time that kimonda went out of business
[2211.64 --> 2217.16]  So kimonda. Yeah, remember kimonda. Yeah. Yeah, so they're anion consumer lineup of memory
[2217.16 --> 2220.12]  I don't even know if this is interesting to people they might not even be watching. I don't care
[2221.24 --> 2227.96]  So, uh, they're anion brand they had these one gig dims that they were liquidating for I think our cost
[2227.96 --> 2232.12]  Was 20 bucks a pop and at the time?
[2233.16 --> 2235.64]  That was nuts. Yeah, it was wild
[2236.20 --> 2241.32]  So ncix bought everything that we could take and internally we were buying them at cost
[2241.72 --> 2244.92]  So it was sick. So I bought so I still have some of that anion memory
[2245.16 --> 2250.60]  Okay, hold on one one quick second here just sort of interest in that era upgrading your ram was like a huge deal
[2250.84 --> 2253.24]  It's a lot. Yes, and no
[2253.56 --> 2257.24]  No, we were a little bit after that ram was not affecting gaming performance anymore
[2257.24 --> 2261.00]  Especially because on the 1366 platform it was
[2262.20 --> 2266.44]  Okay, triple channel memory. Yeah, a little bit before six memory slots
[2266.68 --> 2270.60]  So when I had were they two gig dims? I think they were two gigs for 20 bucks
[2270.92 --> 2273.96]  They were they were two gig dims for 20 bucks and you could get the one gig ones for 10
[2273.96 --> 2277.00]  I just remember when when when we first started playing like ever quest
[2277.96 --> 2281.08]  I never played ever everybody had to go get more ram. I had a life
[2281.64 --> 2286.44]  Wow everybody that I knew I had to like go get more ram in order to play ever quest, but everything else worked
[2286.44 --> 2290.84]  I had a job and a girlfriend. I did not I was younger though
[2291.48 --> 2294.76]  Uh anyway, so sorry so okay, so I went to a 920
[2295.56 --> 2302.12]  Then I think at some point I moved to like uh like an extreme edition on that platform that I borrowed from work
[2302.52 --> 2305.80]  My extreme that's the only reason why I actually switched to intel originally
[2306.44 --> 2308.28]  Was because I got a retail edge extreme edition
[2308.92 --> 2311.24]  And I was like this deal is way too good. Yep
[2311.32 --> 2316.52]  So of course the price performance here is wild. Yeah, so uh retail edge speaking of retail edge
[2316.60 --> 2317.56]  I believe I went
[2317.56 --> 2322.60]  3 000 series through retail edge and then that was right around the time that I became a product reviewer
[2322.60 --> 2327.72]  And I started more legitimately getting chips that I could use in my personal rig from work
[2327.72 --> 2328.20]  Yeah, yeah
[2328.20 --> 2332.68]  Um, so i've been running intel since then and actually my personal rig even though I upgraded it
[2332.68 --> 2337.32]  I did publish a video about that recently. I ended up downgrading it again. So i'm still running a 5960x
[2338.28 --> 2341.96]  So I am looking for an upgrade. I need thunderbolt
[2342.52 --> 2343.72]  Um
[2343.72 --> 2347.32]  Which might be a problem or maybe I could just run discrete cables. I don't know. I'll figure it out
[2347.32 --> 2353.88]  USB 3 extension cables are a bad time from my experience though. Yes, um, Nick is standing here very patiently. What can I do for you, Nick?
[2353.88 --> 2355.88]  What's up, dude?
[2355.88 --> 2357.88]  Hey, you did a really awesome shout out for the merch and then
[2357.88 --> 2359.88]  I did and then the stream died. Okay guys
[2360.68 --> 2361.96]  Oh, right
[2361.96 --> 2370.28]  I actually totally spaced out because I had done it before so you know what we should do our sponsor starting with the LTT store
[2370.84 --> 2372.84]  lmg.gg slash
[2373.08 --> 2376.52]  Elemental so i'm gonna be completely honest with you folks out there
[2376.52 --> 2378.28]  This shirt
[2378.28 --> 2380.28]  Has not been a great mover for us
[2380.76 --> 2382.60]  Um, so we are looking to
[2383.48 --> 2386.84]  Boy, do I have a deal for you ladies and gentlemen. It's actually crazy
[2390.44 --> 2396.04]  I'm gonna blame Nick i'm gonna blame nick. Oh, i'm also gonna blame myself for not wearing them
[2396.52 --> 2400.36]  So uh, because we know that whenever I wear stuff on stream it actually
[2400.84 --> 2401.96]  You guys are like oh, yeah, that's good
[2401.96 --> 2404.92]  I very rarely see you in these shirts. I i very i very
[2404.92 --> 2408.12]  Like I very rarely very rarely wear these ones
[2408.36 --> 2413.88]  So they're supposed to be like not super over the top branded, but just like kind of kind of clean
[2414.76 --> 2419.64]  Just like our other shirts. They're american apparel. So they are super comfy and they're available in red
[2420.28 --> 2422.28]  orange blue and
[2423.00 --> 2426.68]  Green i'm kind of partial to the orange one, but um
[2426.68 --> 2432.44]  Um, you know, they're all kind of the same they're in stock in all sizes from small to triple xl and
[2433.00 --> 2435.08]  If you buy either a hat
[2435.96 --> 2436.28]  Or
[2436.28 --> 2439.48]  A water bottle both of which we have plenty of stock of
[2439.48 --> 2445.64]  I actually would have really liked to do this as a as a coupon where you could just buy anything and get 10 bucks off
[2445.64 --> 2449.16]  But uh, there's a lot of stuff that's really popular like the stealth hoodie
[2449.56 --> 2454.04]  Um, the hard drive shirt the cpu shirt that we just don't have enough stock of and we were worried that
[2454.60 --> 2457.32]  Um, we would like launch this promo code and then people would
[2458.12 --> 2459.80]  Order it and then they would all be gone
[2459.80 --> 2462.92]  So did you guys restock water bottles? Is that what happened?
[2462.92 --> 2465.96]  We restocked water bottles already water bottles like flew out
[2465.96 --> 2469.16]  Yeah, they were gone then we restocked them. Yeah, yeah, so we're good
[2469.16 --> 2473.40]  We have I think a couple thousand water bottles right now, so we should be okay
[2473.88 --> 2474.84]  Dang
[2474.84 --> 2480.44]  Yeah, I mean the store's been doing really really well like a couple thousand water bottles is like okay, but it's not it's not a ton
[2480.44 --> 2482.76]  You guys have been incredibly supportive. Heck yeah
[2482.92 --> 2485.96]  um, so all you got to do is add to cart an elemental shirt
[2486.68 --> 2493.40]  And either a hat or a water bottle and you can actually use the code which is elemental up to twice
[2493.48 --> 2497.80]  So you could buy a hat and a water bottle and get ten dollars off two elemental shirts
[2497.80 --> 2501.00]  And then you go to check out and it will automatically apply the code
[2501.64 --> 2505.80]  For ten dollars off the elemental shirt if you use uh, the lmd.gg
[2506.12 --> 2512.04]  Slash elemental or you can do it manually at lttsore.com and the code is elemental all caps
[2513.40 --> 2514.44]  Thanks for supporting us
[2514.44 --> 2515.48]  Yeah
[2515.48 --> 2516.52]  Yeah, oh
[2516.52 --> 2518.52]  Got you fam
[2518.52 --> 2520.52]  Yeah, but yeah, but he didn't
[2520.52 --> 2522.52]  Fantastic
[2522.52 --> 2528.92]  Agile man other sponsors for the show today's square space. Yeah, do you need to create a beautiful website without the hassle?
[2529.08 --> 2530.28]  We'll check out square space
[2530.28 --> 2533.00]  They're all in one platform makes it easy to get up and running quickly
[2533.00 --> 2537.80]  Which is why we use it for linusmediagroup.com as well as ltx expo.com
[2538.04 --> 2542.04]  They've got award-winning templates that you can use as a starting point for a wide range of projects
[2542.04 --> 2547.88]  And if you need additional help squarespace offers webinars a full series of help guides and you can even contact their customer service
[2548.44 --> 2551.96]  24 7 via live chat and email if you've already got a third-party domain
[2551.96 --> 2554.44]  You don't have to give it up just transfer it over to squarespace
[2554.84 --> 2562.04]  And every squarespace site includes e-commerce features to help you sell merch or services online and easily manage your inventory and orders
[2562.28 --> 2567.72]  It's squarespace.com slash when and offer code when to save 10% on your first purchase
[2567.72 --> 2576.04]  Which I guess is a perfect segue into our ltx 2019 update on our squarespace site the ltx 2019 expo map is here
[2577.16 --> 2583.16]  Yeah, that's the map so the byoc entrance is right here. We've got dedicated bathrooms for you
[2583.48 --> 2589.08]  dedicated gamers is there a dedicated byoc entrance to like the convention you can use either
[2589.88 --> 2592.36]  But this is the one that is closer to the byoc
[2592.36 --> 2597.00]  So we're gonna tell people go this way or go that way and if you guys ignore us
[2597.08 --> 2600.84]  You will ultimately be able to get where you're trying to go. It just will be less efficient
[2600.84 --> 2605.80]  So question about byoc stuff. Is that like roped off or like how does it okay?
[2605.96 --> 2611.40]  Yeah, so the uh, you guys are starting ahead of the game because most conventions don't rope off byoc. Oh, yeah
[2611.40 --> 2613.72]  You gotta have it rope and then it's fine for a couple years
[2613.72 --> 2618.28]  Then things get stolen and then they have to rope it up. Remember that the be right is not ltx
[2619.16 --> 2624.28]  Right, it's dreamhacks byoc. They're doing it, right? So they know what they're doing that makes sense
[2624.84 --> 2631.72]  So dreamhacks free play is right here. The byoc is right here the free play admin and the byoc admin is here and here
[2631.88 --> 2635.32]  This is the stream studio. I think they're planning to bring some streamers out or something. Yeah
[2635.32 --> 2640.76]  This is the vip special guest byoc. So that's where you'll set up cool flow plane people main stage
[2641.32 --> 2645.88]  Meet and greet with creators of which we have like two dozen coming now
[2645.88 --> 2650.28]  I love how the float where all the float plane people are is gonna be right next to meet and greet for creators
[2650.28 --> 2652.92]  So I can just try to like poach people as they finish their meet and greets
[2652.92 --> 2655.08]  There will be lion's handker people there too
[2655.08 --> 2659.64]  Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, very cool. We're doing gladiator jousting motherboard house of cards
[2659.64 --> 2661.80]  We have an entire pallet of pcbs
[2662.36 --> 2668.04]  So people are gonna be able to like build up you're gonna try and build the tallest house of cards from pcbs. There'll be prizes
[2668.04 --> 2671.08]  Nice, we have so much prizing
[2671.72 --> 2677.16]  Nvidia sent over a hundred pounds of graphics cards. I was gonna say wasn't it like you did it based on weight or something? Yeah
[2677.16 --> 2680.60]  Yeah, there's like rtx 2080 ti's 20 70s
[2681.08 --> 2682.12]  20 60s
[2682.12 --> 2682.92]  That's awesome
[2682.92 --> 2684.92]  Zotac is sending three pallets
[2684.92 --> 2688.44]  Zotac is sending three pallets of prizing. Have they gone mad son?
[2689.64 --> 2690.60]  What?
[2691.16 --> 2693.24]  That's amazing. What are they even drunking?
[2694.44 --> 2699.88]  It kind of makes sense. Okay, I'm gonna give you another pax history thing. Sorry early day early days of pax
[2699.88 --> 2701.88]  It was much more hardware based
[2701.88 --> 2707.08]  I remember one year Nvidia was an entire wall in the singular convention center that there was
[2707.48 --> 2709.40]  A singular convention hall that there was
[2710.12 --> 2718.04]  And like many many many more hardware booths and back then we would come back from conventions with like bags of swag and we would often like
[2718.92 --> 2723.80]  Technically make more off of swag than we spent on the tickets and the trip in general
[2723.80 --> 2727.48]  Which was like wild but that happened many times right now
[2727.80 --> 2731.00]  You're lucky if you get like a few t-shirts because it's all gaming companies
[2731.88 --> 2735.48]  I'm not that surprised that this is going on because it's a hardware based convention
[2735.64 --> 2738.12]  So the hardware guys are just like yeah, I take a bunch of stuff
[2738.12 --> 2739.32]  So which is so cool
[2739.32 --> 2740.52]  We have
[2740.52 --> 2742.52]  3,000 people coming each day
[2742.52 --> 2746.76]  Assuming that we sell the rest of the tickets and like Saturday will be 3,000 people
[2746.76 --> 2751.40]  Yeah, so I'm not saying everyone's gonna get like a full outfit and a gaming. Oh, yeah, no
[2751.40 --> 2757.32]  But we are doing our best to source as much spread it out and give away swag as we can and
[2757.96 --> 2759.88]  Really we want to encourage participation
[2760.36 --> 2761.88]  Yeah, if people participate
[2762.44 --> 2769.08]  They will walk away with something if people don't participate. It's going to be a lot tougher. Yeah, that's kind of the way that I want it to be
[2769.08 --> 2773.96]  I want ltx should be highly interactive. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, that totally makes sense
[2773.96 --> 2776.76]  Uh, so back to the layout razors gonna be there
[2777.32 --> 2781.64]  Uh, this is gonna be fun. There's an escape vr. There's actually a lot of vr experience
[2781.64 --> 2784.84]  So is the escape vr like a room that you have to move through or something?
[2784.84 --> 2790.04]  I don't know exactly how it works, but it's a third-party company that like does these cool. Yeah, so it should be pretty cool
[2790.04 --> 2792.44]  It's an escape room in a vr environment. It's an escape
[2792.52 --> 2796.76]  Trussing and then people actually they can't hear you because you're off mic. Oh, no worries
[2797.40 --> 2799.40]  It's an escape room in a vr environment
[2799.40 --> 2806.12]  There's trussing. Yeah, don't worry. It's fine. Um, there's also like regular vr gaming
[2806.68 --> 2812.76]  Um, and then there's vr which isn't really vr because it's more just reality, but a camera. Uh, RC cars
[2813.56 --> 2813.96]  Um
[2815.24 --> 2817.64]  There's a remote remote cars board game lounge
[2818.20 --> 2823.48]  Uh food and beverage memex is gonna be there msi is gonna be there and that excuse is gonna be there bs mods gonna be there
[2823.48 --> 2830.44]  And when it's stuff cool, so this year there's actually gonna be a bunch of different like hardware brands there physically
[2830.44 --> 2833.88]  And it's gonna be hardcore to like CPU deletting. We're gonna have a booth for that again
[2833.88 --> 2838.84]  So uh, Roman der bauer uh sent over a bunch of his deletting tools. He's actually gonna be there by the way
[2839.16 --> 2842.52]  That's cool. GPU repasting. Uh, that's happening. Um
[2843.40 --> 2851.32]  Dreamhacks indie playground case toss is back and you get to toss an old uh mac pro cheese grater kind of release gigabyte's gonna be there
[2851.32 --> 2854.60]  The retro gaming lounge and vintage pc area are gonna be super cool
[2855.32 --> 2861.72]  Um, dreamhack indie playground. That's actually I love the indie parts of these kind of shows. So it's gonna be sick. Don't miss it
[2862.04 --> 2863.24]  um, yeah
[2864.52 --> 2868.12]  Yeah, it's gonna be sick. Don't miss it. Uh, also sponsoring the show today
[2869.08 --> 2877.56]  Savage jerky. Yeah, I got a nice little note from uh, Jono. I have to try something new today. Oh ran out of maple bacon
[2878.28 --> 2886.12]  Getting more love Jono. So you know what? That's fine. The sriracha bacon is actually really good. So I've finally tried my uh
[2888.28 --> 2893.96]  Mojo jalapeno hot sauce. Yeah, it's actually amazing. My favorite part about it is the aftertaste
[2893.96 --> 2897.56]  So if you eat kind of slowly which I do it's perfect
[2897.56 --> 2903.96]  You're the slowest eater of all time which makes it perfect. Like you're so slow. Yeah, it's astonishing. Mm-hmm
[2904.76 --> 2912.60]  Meanwhile, david I went on a trip with him and we both ordered a pizza and we were sitting on the um, like the curb eating it in germany
[2913.08 --> 2918.44]  Because I don't know why not sure so we're so we're like eating this pizza. We both eat about half of our pizza
[2919.16 --> 2920.44]  and um
[2920.44 --> 2922.60]  Well, he ate his half a lot faster than me anyway
[2923.32 --> 2928.28]  We both got half a pizza left we're walking around after we decide to like walk back to the hotel because like we're just chilling
[2928.28 --> 2931.08]  It's middle of the night. Yeah, we're all jet-lagged as hell. Uh-huh. Um
[2932.68 --> 2934.44]  And he just like throws away his box
[2935.48 --> 2937.48]  And i'm like dude
[2937.96 --> 2942.52]  Like why'd you just throw away food like that sucks and he's like no, I ate it. I was like
[2943.88 --> 2945.88]  I did not see you
[2945.88 --> 2947.88]  I did not see you open the box
[2947.88 --> 2949.80]  Remove food from it
[2949.80 --> 2952.68]  Or put it in your mouth the conversation never faltered
[2953.56 --> 2956.84]  The guy inhales food. I've never seen anything like it. That's awesome
[2957.16 --> 2963.48]  Uh savage jerky their goal was to create a snack that's full of flavor and spice, but that isn't bad for you
[2963.96 --> 2969.48]  They've got 13 different flavors of jerky like their sriracha bacon and maple buffalo bacon, which is my personal favorite
[2970.04 --> 2973.00]  Just looking at a package of maple buffalo bacon makes my mouth water
[2973.24 --> 2979.72]  They also make barbecue sauce hot sauce and a spice rub their carolina reaper hot sauce uses one of the hottest peppers in the world the carolina reaper and
[2979.72 --> 2983.88]  You can use offer code LTT to save 10% on all their products
[2983.88 --> 2989.24]  Also, they have a new amazing offer buy two maple bacons and get the third one free
[2989.88 --> 2994.52]  No coupon code necessary, but it does not stack with the 10% all right. That's good to know
[2996.52 --> 2998.52]  They stand here to make sure i'm gonna do the read right
[2999.56 --> 3000.76]  Well, did you do this one?
[3000.76 --> 3003.64]  Is there one really good too sriracha have you tried this one sriracha bacon?
[3004.12 --> 3005.72]  I don't think so
[3005.72 --> 3006.68]  Wow
[3006.68 --> 3008.28]  That's really tasty
[3008.28 --> 3013.48]  They finally got you to try something out and you like it. Well, i'm still going back to the maple buffalo. Okay. I love the maple buffalo
[3013.64 --> 3015.64]  At least it got a seal of approval. Yeah
[3016.20 --> 3017.48]  That's good enough
[3017.48 --> 3021.88]  Use code linus to get 40% off at madrinascoffee.com slash linus
[3022.36 --> 3023.24]  um
[3023.24 --> 3029.96]  They've approved by no no i'm gonna leave madrina's coffee is coffee for fuel organic cold brew coffee in a convenient 15 ounce can
[3030.92 --> 3036.84]  With a flavor for everyone. They've got sweet and creamy flavors like their mocha or caramel and bold flavors like their cold brew black
[3036.84 --> 3039.96]  We actually have a permanent item on their store the lambo roast
[3040.60 --> 3045.40]  A couple of permanent items lambo roast as well as the vanilla cold brew
[3045.72 --> 3049.96]  So head over to madrinascoffee.com slash linus and get no way these guys are nuts
[3050.44 --> 3057.64]  50% off instead of the regular 40% off for your entire order with code linus for the next 72 hours
[3057.64 --> 3061.16]  So go go go go go go and if you have any questions
[3061.40 --> 3065.16]  About the various flavors of cold brew or their micro roast shlomo from madrinas
[3065.88 --> 3069.96]  Is in the chat and ready to answer your questions through direct messages
[3072.04 --> 3075.40]  All right, we've got a couple more topics that i think we really wanted to talk about today
[3075.80 --> 3078.52]  Um displayport 2.0. I hate displayport. Yep
[3079.40 --> 3083.24]  I love it when it works. Yep. I hate it when it doesn't work. Yep
[3083.24 --> 3090.44]  And it just it seems to not work for me at the most inopportune times if you have a monitor basically exactly next to your computer
[3091.08 --> 3095.08]  Fantastic if you have to do anything funky with it ever it's horrible
[3095.72 --> 3098.12]  Sometimes it doesn't even hot plug. Yeah
[3099.64 --> 3105.08]  It's wild hopefully they fix that stuff in the new version. I don't know how much I trust that but
[3105.88 --> 3109.16]  You know hopefully it's crazy fast 80 gigabit per second
[3109.96 --> 3115.72]  Of raw bandwidth effective bandwidth of 77.37, which is pretty nuts 8k 60 hertz
[3116.28 --> 3118.28]  HDR
[3118.28 --> 3127.56]  8k at 60 hertz sdr greater than 8k greater than 8k 60 hertz sdr 4k at 144 hertz hdr wow and two times 5k so dual monitor
[3128.04 --> 3131.00]  If you wanted to daisy chain yeah, okay at 60 hertz so
[3131.72 --> 3138.20]  Basically, this is the biggest leap forward in displayport bandwidth ever so 1 and 1.1
[3139.00 --> 3144.36]  Were 8.6 gigabit per second so you could do 1440p at 60 hertz which was a big deal at the time
[3144.36 --> 3144.92]  Yeah
[3144.92 --> 3149.64]  1.2 doubled that more a little more than doubled that so you could do 4k 60 hertz
[3150.04 --> 3154.52]  That was a big deal because prior to that to run 4k you had to do two cables dual cable
[3154.52 --> 3158.36]  And like tiling on your display which was really cheesy. It was bad time. It was not good
[3158.68 --> 3159.56]  um
[3159.56 --> 3168.52]  1.3 and 1.4 could do up to 25.92 so that was actually a pretty small leap forward 4k 120 hertz or 8k at 60 hertz
[3168.52 --> 3175.48]  With dsc which is if I recall correctly that acronym is the compression or the lossless compression
[3176.28 --> 3176.52]  um
[3177.32 --> 3178.36]  And then
[3178.36 --> 3184.28]  Finally dp 2.0 with I love this. I love this the like the acronym for the code name for it
[3184.28 --> 3189.08]  Whatever you want to call it is uhbr which to me sounds like uber uber uber 20
[3189.08 --> 3195.16]  77.37 gigabit per second so this is a tripling in speed
[3196.44 --> 3198.92]  Huge nut absolutely huge
[3199.72 --> 3206.12]  So they've got not just one but a few different bit rate modes the fastest mode in displayport 2.0 will top out at 80 gigabits per second of raw
[3206.12 --> 3209.64]  Bandwidth to about two and a half times that of 1.3 1.4
[3210.12 --> 3214.28]  It also introduces a more efficient coding scheme resulting in less coding overhead
[3214.52 --> 3219.08]  So as a result the effective bandwidth of the new standard will peak at 77.4 so that's three times
[3219.64 --> 3222.12]  Uh the physical characteristics the port itself is staying
[3222.60 --> 3222.92]  Yes
[3223.64 --> 3228.68]  That's good. Uh both the port that we have now and the usb-c connector via the dp alt mode
[3229.16 --> 3235.48]  Both the official ports for the new displayport 2.0 standard and the number of pins and resulting high-speed data lanes is remaining
[3235.88 --> 3238.60]  Unchanged so it will continue to operate over four lanes
[3239.48 --> 3244.28]  It also retains the packet-based approach to communication which means that image data continues to be sent as packet
[3244.28 --> 3247.88]  So over a fixed bandwidth link as opposed to pixel centric pixel clock approaches
[3248.36 --> 3253.88]  And so what has changed is that the rest of the physical layer has been almost entirely replaced
[3254.36 --> 3261.96]  So thunderbolt 3 oh with thunderbolt 3 which is now a royalty-free standard. Yeah, and is going to be called usb4. I guess
[3262.76 --> 3268.44]  Except not quite because I think thunderbolt branding intel is still going to be using as sort of like their
[3269.16 --> 3273.80]  Best-in-class implementation of the usb4 standard that is
[3274.36 --> 3276.68]  Um sort of that has a lot of optional components
[3277.64 --> 3282.68]  Um, so thunderbolt 3 is truly bi-directional full duplex link two lanes allocated for each direction
[3283.96 --> 3288.36]  Um, oh and displayport is focused on sending large volumes of data in just one direction
[3288.36 --> 3291.56]  So displayport 2.0 reverses the two inbound lanes to outbound
[3292.52 --> 3293.48]  Cool
[3293.48 --> 3297.40]  That's actually that makes a lot of sense. I'm stoked as long as it actually works. Yeah, yeah
[3298.52 --> 3302.68]  And I guess actually that's kind of oh, yeah, we can talk about the laser one sure yeah, so
[3303.08 --> 3305.64]  Uh, it's a new device developed by the pentagon
[3305.96 --> 3311.88]  Um after the u.s. special forces requested it basically everyone has a cardiac signature
[3312.36 --> 3315.24]  Um, and they can read that cardiac signature with an infrared laser
[3315.24 --> 3321.56]  Apparently it works through typical clothing like a shirt or a jacket which surprised me wow
[3321.56 --> 3325.64]  Um, but apparently not a thicker like winter coat
[3326.92 --> 3330.36]  But still a jacket which blows my mind and i'm assuming they're gonna have
[3331.16 --> 3335.40]  I'm kind of wondering if they're including like windbreakers as a jacket hard to say
[3336.04 --> 3338.92]  I don't know if it's to do with thickness or to do with layers
[3338.92 --> 3342.52]  Layers might be a problem, too. I'm not sure
[3342.92 --> 3349.08]  Uh, but but yeah, apparently cardiac signatures are already in use for security identification. This has happened before
[3349.64 --> 3353.72]  Canadian company company that i'm gonna butcher the name of but i think it's nymie
[3353.72 --> 3359.40]  Has developed a wrist worn pulse sensor as an alternative uh to fingerprint identification
[3360.04 --> 3361.96]  A little little crazy
[3361.96 --> 3367.08]  Apparently it can take a little while for it to kind of lock on but it does work at a fairly far distance
[3367.08 --> 3374.20]  Uh, so it's only really effective if the subject is sitting or standing not really like moving around and stuff got it
[3374.76 --> 3377.96]  Yeah, so 200 meters it works from pretty wild
[3379.48 --> 3380.92]  That's crazy pretty wild
[3381.88 --> 3387.32]  Um, so one glaring limitation is the need for a database of cardiac signatures
[3387.80 --> 3392.68]  But even without this the system has its uses but you could probably pretty easily get that
[3392.68 --> 3397.80]  Especially at like passport stations. Mm-hmm where people have to stand there for a while
[3398.44 --> 3400.36]  You could just install it and grab it. Yeah
[3401.24 --> 3402.36]  Yeah
[3402.92 --> 3405.96]  Because you're you're handing them a passport you're giving them your name and all your information
[3405.96 --> 3409.56]  So yeah match that up and create a national database really fast called jetson
[3410.20 --> 3415.32]  In practice, it's likely to be used alongside facial recognition or other identification methods, but
[3415.32 --> 3423.08]  um, um, in the long term the developers believe in addition to identification it could be used to scan for arrhythmias and other conditions remotely
[3424.12 --> 3428.68]  Um, and hospitals could monitor the condition of patients without having to wire them up to machines, which I guess is cool
[3429.24 --> 3430.12]  Yeah, but
[3430.12 --> 3435.00]  It's just yet another way that big brother will be watching and there's no real preventing it at this point
[3435.96 --> 3437.96]  Yeah, this one's kind of hard to
[3437.96 --> 3439.96]  Screw with the future is now
[3440.28 --> 3443.08]  Yeah, you start wearing like a plate over your chest
[3443.08 --> 3447.72]  I was thinking about but it's not just that because I think it can see it through your skin in general
[3448.04 --> 3451.48]  Yeah, I guess they don't even have a cardiac signature in like your arm, right? Yeah
[3453.24 --> 3455.08]  So you'd have to have clothing clothes
[3456.12 --> 3459.08]  Only solution lead clothing you'd have to have clothing that like ripples
[3459.64 --> 3466.68]  Intentionally like actively ripples you'd have to have active clothing active active ir camouflage
[3466.68 --> 3475.32]  All right, then so that's what I'm gonna show you guys see you again next week same bad time the same bad channel. Bye. See you later
[3482.04 --> 3484.04]  It's vibrating chain mail
[3484.04 --> 3486.04]  Oh
[3489.48 --> 3491.48]  Vibrating chain
[3493.56 --> 3495.56]  Super chats. Oh
[3495.56 --> 3498.04]  Happy birthday, Preston. Happy birthday Wyatt
[3499.00 --> 3504.76]  Lazy ak47 says saw you in a pulse weight commercial any other commercials you're in or will be in no not at this time
[3504.76 --> 3509.56]  But it is a service that linus media group does offer like commercial production
[3509.56 --> 3512.76]  It's not something that we publicize a ton
[3513.40 --> 3517.08]  um, so the only reason we ended up doing that with pulse way was just cuz like
[3518.60 --> 3521.96]  I don't know. We just kind of ended up chatting about it like it wasn't um
[3521.96 --> 3525.00]  Yeah, I don't even know if it's on our website, but yes, it is something that we do
[3525.00 --> 3527.00]  But no, there's nothing really planned right now
[3527.72 --> 3529.64]  Bob says cut cake or cupcakes
[3531.24 --> 3535.24]  You know i'm not a cake guy or a cupcake guy neither give me a good muffin
[3535.24 --> 3537.24]  Oh
[3537.96 --> 3543.72]  Yeah, okay on this topic because I wonder for the same about this too chocolate chip cookie oatmeal raisin cookie
[3544.52 --> 3545.56]  oatmeal chocolate chip
[3546.36 --> 3548.44]  Whoa, I don't think i've had that
[3549.40 --> 3552.60]  It's amazing oatmeal is just better in my opinion
[3553.48 --> 3557.32]  Okay, sorry, we can keep going. See i'm not that into chocolate chip cookies because they're usually
[3558.36 --> 3562.92]  Crappy cookie. Yeah, and they just try to get by on the chocolate. Yeah, doesn't work that way. Yeah
[3563.88 --> 3565.56]  um
[3565.56 --> 3570.92]  Illya minus will you ever tell us about that colorful dragon tattoo you had about a half year ago? Yeah, I was just messing with you guys
[3570.92 --> 3572.92]  It's just a spray on thing. Oh
[3573.80 --> 3578.20]  That people thought that was real a lot of people did wow well, I kept reapplying it
[3578.84 --> 3583.72]  So it looked fresh for like quite a long time. Oh, yeah, interesting. I was just messing with people. Yeah, um
[3584.68 --> 3587.80]  Video suggestion a collab with your bower since he's coming to ltx anyway
[3587.80 --> 3596.44]  The problem is that everyone in their dog is coming to ltx and they're coming for ltx and i'm gonna be like scrambling in the lead-up to ltx
[3596.76 --> 3602.36]  And then recovering from ltx so unless they're like hanging around for a week. That's probably not going to be feasible
[3604.20 --> 3610.28]  Other side guy would you agree that car culture and building custom cars and modding is similar to the pc space? Yes. Oh, yeah, definitely
[3610.28 --> 3613.40]  Hey linus decided to blow five bucks just to see you make a funny face
[3615.64 --> 3618.20]  All right gap to granny
[3619.32 --> 3621.32]  um
[3622.36 --> 3624.92]  Ryan says linus if you phase yourself out i'm gonna kermit
[3626.52 --> 3628.36]  What is kermit?
[3628.36 --> 3630.36]  What is kermit? I don't know
[3632.12 --> 3636.12]  Uh, david says line has been a huge fan of your channel for years taught me a lot keep up the good work. Thank you
[3636.12 --> 3644.04]  Uh, john says andy will probably move to four threads per core before intel just to fully nut kick them
[3644.60 --> 3646.20]  Uh, yeah
[3646.20 --> 3648.04]  They probably will
[3648.04 --> 3652.52]  Oh, what did I click? I don't know. Oh, no the down arrow maybe. Oh crud
[3652.92 --> 3657.88]  Uh, timo. I did I got my new ltx hat and hoodie with home door delivery
[3659.16 --> 3663.56]  Post girl did apparently say that so you didn't need to go to the post office
[3663.56 --> 3666.12]  Man, canada post rocks in finland
[3667.32 --> 3668.12]  Great feedback
[3669.32 --> 3670.04]  Glad to hear
[3671.32 --> 3677.00]  Shout out to my wife claire who is probably listening to this tomorrow says seal team ricks. Hey cool
[3677.56 --> 3678.44]  um
[3678.44 --> 3683.48]  Midland says good evening linus would you ever consider building your own studio and what would you need in your dream studio?
[3683.64 --> 3687.88]  What a tremendous question. So if I were to build my own studio first
[3687.88 --> 3689.88]  I
[3689.88 --> 3694.12]  Would start with a ground floor with like a library for kind of like a quiet place to sit
[3694.92 --> 3698.52]  An editing den for all the editors to sit and work together and collaborate
[3699.16 --> 3704.12]  Like a camera area where we can build up our rigs and tear them down and store them safely and like maybe a bathroom
[3705.16 --> 3706.76]  Upstairs from that
[3706.76 --> 3709.32]  I'd put a boardroom. I'd put my office
[3709.80 --> 3713.00]  I'd put an office for my wife who does all the accounting so she needs privacy
[3713.00 --> 3716.28]  I'd put another small office just in case we needed it in the future
[3716.52 --> 3722.04]  Maybe a nice open space so that we could put cubicles or something like that nice nice nice another bathroom probably yeah
[3722.36 --> 3724.36]  Then I'd expand it. Okay, okay
[3724.84 --> 3726.76]  So I'd put nick in my wife's office
[3726.76 --> 3730.12]  I'd put her in mine and then I'd move over to the other side where there would be three offices
[3730.92 --> 3733.80]  Um, luke had one of them at one point, but we would have kicked him out by then
[3734.20 --> 3738.68]  Um, we'd leave one of them open for like meetings. Yeah, I'd take one of them
[3739.08 --> 3741.64]  Uh, then we'd have like an open space for the writers another bathroom
[3741.64 --> 3746.92]  The more people you add the more people need to pee. Yeah, um, i'd move the camera people out into the warehouse at that point
[3746.92 --> 3750.04]  I'd probably start with three warehouse units and I'd do like a green screen
[3750.52 --> 3755.40]  Like an ltt set like a workshop a tech link set and then like some storage area
[3755.96 --> 3759.56]  Maybe maybe a little nook for the wan show then i'd probably get a couple more units
[3759.56 --> 3766.36]  I'd add like an employee lounge and some more storage and then maybe like a hardcore workshop with like modding stuff sweet. Yeah, that's probably what i'd do
[3766.68 --> 3768.28]  smart considerate
[3768.28 --> 3770.28]  concise, that's what i'd do
[3771.64 --> 3774.04]  Um, I was being facetious. That's our studio
[3775.64 --> 3776.92]  Yeah, what did he mean?
[3776.92 --> 3780.44]  They probably didn't know that we have a studio. Oh i'm just teasing
[3781.40 --> 3786.20]  We have a studio. Yeah, we got our studio about four years ago. Yeah, um
[3787.32 --> 3792.92]  Well, I could understand why people don't know because we intentionally changed the sets to look like a house
[3794.44 --> 3796.76]  So anyone who started watching in the last year or two
[3797.40 --> 3800.84]  Might not realize that the kitchen that we shoot in all the time is not a real kitchen
[3801.80 --> 3803.64]  That was the whole idea. Wow, that's so weird to me
[3803.64 --> 3809.72]  We wanted the videos to look less like a set in a studio and more like we just shoot out of a house like a normal youtuber
[3809.72 --> 3811.72]  But you do videos out in the warehouse sometimes
[3812.52 --> 3813.88]  Not that often anymore. Not that often?
[3814.28 --> 3814.52]  No
[3815.40 --> 3816.76]  Weird that makes sense
[3818.20 --> 3820.92]  Nikola, I'm going to an english course in vancouver, but i'm missing ltx
[3820.92 --> 3822.92]  Oh
[3822.92 --> 3826.12]  Rude what could I do that's tech related while visiting honestly not much
[3830.28 --> 3831.32]  Ooh
[3831.32 --> 3835.56]  Read it says are you going to do something ridiculous and cool with the corning off go to free cable?
[3835.56 --> 3838.36]  Oh, yeah, go to free geek do that. That's a good idea. Thank you
[3839.00 --> 3842.44]  Um, yes, i'd love to they're supposed to send me one, but they haven't yet
[3842.44 --> 3848.28]  Uh, joshua says there has been a way to add special ir commands to the power sequence on harmony for many years
[3848.28 --> 3852.20]  I think logitech didn't want to blame the customer. Uh, yeah, so the problem was that I couldn't
[3852.84 --> 3854.92]  So you have to pick from a menu
[3857.88 --> 3859.88]  Yeah, we went over all that um
[3859.88 --> 3863.88]  Other side guy
[3863.88 --> 3869.32]  I am oh evs haven't particularly taken off because the futuristic design employed makes them look tacky
[3870.20 --> 3873.88]  Um, yeah, that's a fair point. That's only part of the problem though. Yeah
[3874.12 --> 3878.92]  Aporic says bitcoin is on the rise again. Do you have anything in the works for a mining update? Nope. I'm out
[3881.40 --> 3888.28]  Uh, jake likes tech says this is going toward a new stream pc. That's not the stream pc is not the problem. Also see you at ltx. Okay. See you there
[3889.08 --> 3893.72]  Johnny says oh gee you better make ltx just as big or bigger next year
[3893.72 --> 3895.32]  My boss told me he will
[3896.12 --> 3902.44]  Be pay next year due to he needs me at work in the holidays. I had set aside for going so you better we will try
[3903.00 --> 3905.00]  I honestly can't promise that like
[3905.64 --> 3913.24]  We're gonna have two dozen creators there again because that is costing me a pretty penny the show itself could expand though. Yes
[3913.80 --> 3915.80]  and then maybe
[3915.96 --> 3917.96]  Certain creators will just want to go anyways
[3919.24 --> 3921.64]  Ryan says do you still ride your sv650? Yes
[3925.08 --> 3928.84]  Other side guy, what's your thoughts on australia being non-existent in the tech and gaming industry?
[3930.60 --> 3932.60]  It's really far
[3932.84 --> 3936.60]  That's the only reason i've never done it. There's actually a lot of tech fans in australia
[3937.00 --> 3941.96]  And there's a huge amount of tech sales that happen in australia. So the community is actually pretty decent
[3942.68 --> 3947.56]  Getting a show out there is extremely expensive if you're not based there
[3947.56 --> 3948.76]  Because pax has one
[3948.76 --> 3951.24]  But I think that's it. Yeah, and it's relatively small
[3951.48 --> 3954.84]  Yeah, but again, it's extremely expensive and getting a lot of the creators
[3955.64 --> 3956.60]  out there
[3956.60 --> 3961.56]  Um, show like pax is at the scale where they're not generally paying for creators to go
[3962.12 --> 3966.12]  um, so the creators are going to be sponsoring themselves to go
[3966.60 --> 3972.36]  Um, or getting sponsorships to go and both of those are way more difficult because it's really expensive
[3972.36 --> 3976.20]  And the roi is a little bit different. It's it's a difficult market, but
[3977.24 --> 3982.52]  Like yeah, the the tech community in australia is actually very large vibrant. Yeah. Yeah
[3982.52 --> 3985.40]  All right, bye guys. Goodbye
