[0.00 --> 8.04]  and welcome to the WAN show ladies and gentlemen this is a bit of a tale in
[8.04 --> 12.42]  between my legs show and I'll be talking about that in a little bit more detail
[12.42 --> 18.00]  later but we made a video that you guys didn't like very much and I feel like I
[18.00 --> 24.00]  need to address that YouTube also rolled out some new stuff new copyright claim
[24.00 --> 28.76]  system and new monetization efforts which is cool and there's some other kind of
[28.76 --> 33.62]  general you know Intel's doing some rumory stuff and Nintendo Switch Lite was
[33.62 --> 37.58]  announced and other fun things yeah we've actually got a lot of great topics
[37.58 --> 42.26]  for you guys today Jono did the WAN show document and well he also did it last
[42.26 --> 44.54]  week which is part of the reason that we didn't really didn't have anything to
[44.54 --> 49.26]  talk about last week whoa that's okay because I gave him some coaching this
[49.26 --> 52.52]  week and he checked in with me about the topics ahead of time and I think there's
[52.52 --> 60.38]  actually some some discussion meet in here there's a bit of a a non-controversy
[60.38 --> 69.38]  which not to me in and of itself is kind of controversial so AMD said that PCI
[69.38 --> 75.38]  Express Gen 4 would not work on previous generation motherboards and then ASUS
[75.38 --> 81.38]  went out and published a list of previous gen boards that it'll work on and it's it's a
[81.38 --> 86.24]  it's a funny thing because I think that AMD fanboys aren't really gonna like my
[86.24 --> 92.54]  take on this but my my feeling is that if the same thing had happened with Intel
[92.54 --> 97.64]  people would be shrieking about it and now that it's happening with AMD it's like oh
[97.64 --> 103.82]  that's pretty cool so let's get let's get to that later but first let's go ahead and
[103.82 --> 109.38]  roll the intro and well we'll chat about these topics in a little bit here all right
[109.38 --> 115.32]  okay
[115.32 --> 134.22]  was it just one go ahead and pop that up there
[134.22 --> 146.28]  kind of looks like it was just one and back to us okay so why don't we jump right into the video
[146.28 --> 152.58]  that we uploaded today so this is something that I've actually addressed on the WAN show in the past
[152.58 --> 157.92]  I'm just gonna fire it up on my laptop here hopefully my my screen sharing is working here
[157.92 --> 166.92]  um here we go value noise cancelling headphones so there were a couple of things that went wrong
[166.92 --> 171.36]  today I'm watching it you can do this uh yeah thank you appreciate that so a couple of things that went
[171.36 --> 179.76]  wrong today first of all oh yeah the video went up with entirely the wrong title um okay yes we see
[179.76 --> 184.68]  that there's a little bit of lag on the YouTube stream we are now sort of way beyond I'm not having
[184.68 --> 192.30]  an explanation for it because the entire WAN show PC has been swapped out there's a CPU GPU yeah and it's
[192.30 --> 198.40]  it's even we used to be on x264 encoding and now we're on NVENC um so it couldn't actually be any
[198.40 --> 204.80]  different than it is now we are back on the old ethernet cable yeah also the uh like retransmitting
[204.80 --> 210.34]  server the splitter uh there was like some a little bit of funkery there but that's all been updated and
[210.34 --> 216.36]  fixed and worked on and was tested for the last half hour on a separate account yeah so it's starting
[216.36 --> 222.82]  to get to the point where um Robert by the way no your super chat is not pre-recorded so it's starting
[222.82 --> 228.96]  to get to the point where it's just like not really funny anymore yeah uh we're just gonna have to power
[228.96 --> 234.72]  through the show here though guys um realistically twitch is probably better uh so you can head over
[234.72 --> 240.56]  to twitch and watch there we still have no explanation for why that would be yeah uh anyway so I'm gonna go
[240.56 --> 246.16]  ahead and pull up the video that we did today so this video was called and this was mistake number
[246.16 --> 251.58]  one it was called why is everybody buying these headphones which was actually just one of those
[251.58 --> 258.14]  complete boneheaded errors and I'm not gonna throw anyone under the bus but I think we can all guess
[258.14 --> 264.76]  who it is that usually makes those particularly egregious errors on the channel and never actually
[264.76 --> 272.88]  does get fired because I love him so much um anyway someone grabbed the wrong title I have no idea where
[272.88 --> 278.28]  it came from I actually did see that that title was on the pre-release video file but I didn't really
[278.28 --> 282.60]  think anything of it I thought maybe just one of the editors was confused about it and named the file
[282.60 --> 288.12]  that and that like the the file name is not generally anything to do with the actual name of the video
[288.12 --> 296.26]  once we go live but somehow it ended up with the name of a series that we run on the channel why is
[296.26 --> 303.60]  everybody buying this x that has never been sponsored before whether it's sponsored by the retailer that we
[303.60 --> 310.76]  got it from or sponsored by the the products that we featured um it has never been sponsored before
[310.76 --> 316.46]  uh by either of those two parties like third party sponsors sure you know your savage jerky or whatever
[316.46 --> 323.52]  the case may be so that created initially a ton of confusion and a ton of upset because all of a sudden
[323.52 --> 329.14]  we had a sponsored showcase video you can see that whatever corner it is right there sponsored by
[329.14 --> 336.42]  taotronics that seemed to be disguised as editorial content something that we actually work really hard
[336.42 --> 343.68]  to not have happen which is why thankfully at least at the beginning I actually I'm not sure I believe the
[343.68 --> 349.42]  word showcase was already in there but it is supposed to be so if there's a video that is just like
[349.42 --> 354.00]  here's information about a product but it's sponsored by that company or by that product or
[354.00 --> 359.84]  by somewhere to get it it is supposed to be clearly displayed in the title of the video so that you know
[359.84 --> 365.00]  and in the video as as it is down in whatever corner I'm supposed to oh it's not even there
[365.00 --> 371.54]  that way my corner uh sponsored by taotronics okay so that was problem number one that people had with
[371.54 --> 376.66]  the video as soon as Nick was actually the one who spotted it as soon as Nick saw that the title wasn't
[376.66 --> 381.00]  right he had it changed this is what it was supposed to be value noise cancelling headphones
[381.00 --> 389.52]  sound surge 46 showcase okay oops so that one's pretty straightforward whoops are bad the other one
[389.52 --> 395.14]  is a little bit more difficult to address and I feel like I'm almost going to have to do a complete
[395.14 --> 401.36]  video talking about this at some point in the future because there seems to be a lot of confusion
[401.36 --> 408.34]  in people's minds about the way that we handle our sponsored content so we made the decision it must
[408.34 --> 416.40]  have been about a year ago now to start doing what we called showcases which are essentially what most of
[416.40 --> 423.92]  the rest of the industry that is YouTube personalities is doing where essentially there's some product or
[423.92 --> 431.76]  some service and there's a sponsorship involved and you're basically given a bullet point list of things
[431.76 --> 440.80]  to say about it so our way of reconciling that because obviously that's not editorial content that's not
[440.80 --> 447.84]  um you know my opinion um the way that we reconciled that was okay here's the deal audience we're gonna do
[447.84 --> 454.32]  these but we're gonna do them as extra releases so you'll notice this video went up on a friday so
[454.32 --> 460.24]  instead of the linus tech tips channel getting six normal videos plus wan show for a total of seven that's
[460.24 --> 466.56]  one every day it was actually six normal videos plus this one plus wan show so there were a total of eight
[466.56 --> 475.52]  videos so we didn't want these sponsored showcases the sponsored content to interfere with our regular upload
[475.52 --> 480.32]  schedule we didn't want you guys to feel like you were getting cheated and you were missing out on
[480.32 --> 487.92]  an editorial or a project-based piece of content because we had decided to do one of these showcases
[487.92 --> 494.08]  so that was number one was we didn't want it to affect the volume of content that you guys get that is
[494.08 --> 505.12]  our usual type um number two was we wanted to separate our opinion which cannot be purchased from
[505.68 --> 513.84]  airtime on our channel which can be purchased so when i talk about buying airtime you are in much the
[513.84 --> 519.84]  same way that you would sponsor a podcast or a radio show you are paying for the host to read your
[519.84 --> 525.92]  talking points be it about savage jerky ridge wallet the elgato stream deck or you know any number of
[525.92 --> 531.04]  other other brands and products that have that have sponsored our show yeah sure ltx
[531.04 --> 543.36]  um so the distinction then is you can pay for words to be said but you cannot pay for an opinion so
[543.36 --> 551.68]  that's where i feel like people are really allowing the waters to get muddied in their minds between
[551.68 --> 559.36]  reviews and sponsored videos so a lot of the complaints about this video aside from the ones
[559.36 --> 563.68]  about the title being wrong and it really was that was absolutely our mistake and we're sorry that's
[563.68 --> 572.08]  our bad um a lot of the complaints are that we didn't give an opinion this is this is a you know
[572.08 --> 576.00]  i could here i'm just gonna i'm gonna scroll down and find something here you know because i'm sure it
[576.00 --> 581.60]  won't be that hard okay here's one that i pinned because i did respond to him um so what other than
[581.60 --> 586.32]  the requested sponsored talking points can you give us anything of your own or are you just reading
[586.32 --> 592.56]  off their marketing material the answer is i am reading off their marketing material and when it
[592.56 --> 602.24]  comes to any other sponsored piece of content so are they that's how it works anytime i were to give
[602.24 --> 609.12]  you guys an opinion in a sponsored piece of content i'm not talking about like picking it up like so here's
[609.12 --> 614.72]  a ridge wallet you know it's made of carbon fiber feels pretty solid i am demonstrating that it's
[614.72 --> 620.32]  solid yes i'm saying it feels pretty solid to me or whatever but that is a that is a demonstrable
[620.32 --> 626.64]  objective fact it's it's really well built that's not really an opinion even though it's being presented
[626.64 --> 635.76]  in the form of an opinion um and so anytime we are giving an if we were to give opinions in our
[635.76 --> 645.28]  sponsored content then we create a really awkward and a really dangerous crossover between a review
[645.28 --> 651.28]  and that is a word that we use very carefully a review cannot be sponsored by the subject of the
[651.28 --> 658.32]  review because there is an inherent obvious conflict of interest that prevents any information in that
[658.32 --> 665.12]  review from being taken at its face value so we keep a review separate from a sponsored showcase because
[665.12 --> 673.20]  yes that is exactly what a sponsored video is now some sponsors in fact howtronics was one of
[673.20 --> 680.88]  them do allow us to give you guys useful information we did mention some of the more negative points
[680.88 --> 686.40]  of those headphones in the video and in fact we've run into this a lot of the time especially brands that
[687.04 --> 693.12]  wear their their big kid pants and are willing to take criticism will even allow it in a sponsored video
[693.12 --> 700.56]  but what you guys need to understand is that every brand towtronics cisco intel amd nvidia anyone that
[700.56 --> 707.84]  we've ever worked with over the years has a say in a sponsored piece of content so anything that is in
[707.84 --> 713.20]  that finished video and this goes not just for us but any channel that you watch at least the ones where
[713.20 --> 720.08]  at least they disclose it any channel you watch that does a sponsored video the brand that sponsored it
[720.08 --> 725.76]  had to say and if there was something they didn't like it was probably removed depending on the contract i would say with
[726.64 --> 733.60]  98 percent certainty that would have been removed i mean there are going to be creators out there that have more power
[733.60 --> 737.60]  that have more weight to throw around and say no this is my artistic vision it stays
[737.60 --> 742.24]  and we've been able to throw that weight around a fair number of times but sometimes
[742.24 --> 749.12]  it doesn't work or the contract isn't favorable or whatever the case may be so clear about it not
[749.12 --> 753.68]  working just because i feel like this could get misconstrued in some way if it doesn't work the
[753.68 --> 759.28]  video just doesn't come out it's not like he'll say something that he strongly doesn't believe in and
[759.28 --> 763.04]  release the video anyways just he's like well they strong-armed me the video just won't come out and
[763.04 --> 771.52]  the contract will not be made and that has happened yeah um like has 100 happened yes um so then so you
[771.52 --> 775.36]  know addressing a few more of the most upvoted comments here because i feel like this is a really
[775.36 --> 779.76]  important topic not just on our channel but in general it's something that's really important for
[779.76 --> 786.96]  you guys to understand um so why is everyone okay no yeah sorry that was about the title it's uh super
[786.96 --> 792.88]  this is an ad with no actual content wtf yes that's why it says sponsored by tautronics and that's why it
[792.88 --> 798.08]  says showcase in the title because at the end of the day that's basically what it is and the wtf is
[798.08 --> 803.76]  this was an extra piece of content we labeled it with showcase after the fact and i'm really sorry
[803.76 --> 809.92]  about that we labeled it with showcase if you don't want to see it don't watch it that really is
[809.92 --> 815.52]  our stance on them something i want to throw in personally as a technically outside person on this
[815.52 --> 819.92]  is i hadn't watched this at all sat here and watched part of it before the show there are parts of
[819.92 --> 823.60]  the video where you criticize it i know you mentioned this earlier people are saying there's
[823.60 --> 829.04]  literally no points that aren't in the sponsor spot there's like no way that's true because they're not
[829.04 --> 833.36]  going to put in the sponsor spot hey this button is i don't remember exactly how you word it but not
[833.36 --> 838.72]  great and takes a little bit getting used to that's not going to be in the sponsor spot so like yeah i i
[838.72 --> 845.68]  hear you guys but so this is this is another really great example right here of exactly the mentality that
[845.68 --> 853.36]  we need to we need to kill um i don't mind sponsored videos but this was just a four minute
[853.36 --> 860.56]  ad there was no review or anything if it's sponsored there is no review period that's not how these
[860.56 --> 866.64]  contracts work and you don't want them to work that way no you don't you want reviews to be really
[866.64 --> 872.08]  really clearly separated from anything that is sponsored in a way that could create a conflict of
[872.08 --> 882.48]  interest absolutely um that's like very important so yeah i mean most of the complaints probably the
[882.48 --> 887.20]  most blatant clickbait title i've seen nobody not a single soul linus everybody is buying and that's
[887.20 --> 892.64]  that's fair because the original title is is crazy i i will throw another defend in that yeah linus
[892.64 --> 897.36]  media group has published like what thousands of videos at this point there's going to be oopsies and
[897.36 --> 902.96]  titles every once in a while it's still bad this one is particularly particularly bad because it
[902.96 --> 910.08]  wasn't just it didn't sort of it didn't just violate our own standards for what constitutes clickbait yeah
[910.08 --> 917.60]  uh it it violates our our editorial oh it's bad all i'm saying is people will make mistakes so we're
[917.60 --> 922.96]  clear that it's bad oh it's bad it's really bad um but like i wouldn't and pointing it out you know what
[922.96 --> 928.64]  solid because it needs to be pointed out so that it gets changed etc etc etc um but like i don't know
[928.64 --> 935.52]  i'd i'd measure your pitchforkedness because it was changed quickly oh surprise luke is defending lmg
[935.52 --> 941.12]  well no crap i think it's also very reasonable um there was a mistake they understood it was a mistake
[941.12 --> 946.40]  they changed the title these showcase content has been happening forever uh there are legitimate
[946.40 --> 952.72]  criticisms within a showcase video which in my opinion is marginally above and beyond um i mean
[952.72 --> 957.52]  there were a couple of things that we felt were really important to mention um like the fact that
[957.52 --> 961.36]  you know what they sound pretty darn good i'm not being sponsored right now say whatever the hell i
[961.36 --> 965.60]  want they sound pretty darn good but not at full volume someone mentioned that in the comments i
[965.60 --> 969.20]  hadn't seen that part of the video but yeah someone mentioned that in twitch chat that you guys said that
[969.20 --> 976.80]  as well like that's there there was extra stuff added on top so we we mentioned the main drawbacks to
[976.80 --> 983.76]  them like to be clear they're fine we wouldn't have taken the deal if we thought they were a bad deal
[983.76 --> 988.96]  also there's a bunch of content especially earlier on where if you watch lioness's videos from
[988.96 --> 993.92]  quite a long time ago when we used to do more headphone coverage mostly unboxings he's mirroring
[993.92 --> 998.32]  the same comments these are opinions he's had for a long time not that opinions shouldn't be able to
[998.32 --> 1002.88]  change over time but like a lot of the things that you said were not surprising to me because i remember
[1002.88 --> 1009.04]  holding a dinky camera and listening you say the same stuff now i have had people upset um particularly
[1009.04 --> 1015.20]  about the fact that i didn't ream on it for having a micro b usb port so i can explain why that would be
[1015.84 --> 1022.64]  the cost to implement usb type c is significantly higher not just in terms of the actual solder
[1022.64 --> 1028.56]  connections because there are more of them and they're finer but in terms of the r d because it is a
[1028.56 --> 1035.44]  more complex standard um by complex standard i mean it is like many different standards many of
[1035.44 --> 1042.08]  which don't uh necessarily work properly with each other building a device that charges over usb type c
[1042.08 --> 1048.72]  is not trivial and there's a reason that even large companies like logitech are still shipping gaming mice
[1048.72 --> 1053.04]  with usb micro b connectors now with someone like logitech
[1053.04 --> 1061.44]  um i have less sympathy because luke has personally visited their r d facilities i think they can figure out
[1061.44 --> 1065.60]  how to put a usb type c connector on something they're kind of amazing actually with towtronics
[1066.16 --> 1070.88]  given the price point and given the fact that what is a device like this
[1071.76 --> 1078.24]  would not have as clear a benefit from type c as some others would like a mouse in particular
[1078.24 --> 1082.96]  now logitech mitigates this somewhat by putting reinforcements around their type c connectors at the end of their
[1082.96 --> 1087.52]  mice so it doesn't put as much strain on it but with a device like a mouse where you're actually
[1087.52 --> 1091.68]  moving it around while it's charging sometimes there's a clear and obvious reason to use a more
[1091.68 --> 1096.00]  durable connector like a type c this is a pair of headphones that you'll probably charge once every
[1096.00 --> 1103.12]  few days for a span of a couple years until you lose them or whatever so micro b yeah it's not as good
[1103.12 --> 1109.04]  but it doesn't need fast charging over type c like it doesn't need you know 30 watt charging or anything
[1109.04 --> 1114.00]  crazy like that it would be more convenient to not have to carry an extra cable but they are a value
[1114.00 --> 1120.72]  option as opposed to a you know 199 or 299 pair of active noise cancelling headphones so i was willing
[1120.72 --> 1127.92]  to be um i was willing to not ream on it and there's no way again remember this is a sponsored piece of
[1127.92 --> 1134.08]  content there's no way i was going to be able to ream on it hard because this is a sponsored piece of
[1134.08 --> 1141.44]  content so why wasn't it in there because given the context i was willing to not ream on it and i
[1141.44 --> 1150.80]  wouldn't have been able to ream on it anyway um all right well i think uh that's pretty much all i have
[1150.80 --> 1157.04]  to say about that yeah oh speaking of all i have to say about that i ate at bubba gump's for the first
[1157.04 --> 1163.44]  time ever yesterday bubba gump's yeah oh down in okay yeah yeah so i actually i and while i was
[1163.44 --> 1168.56]  sitting there i didn't uh yeah well i was down in la for a meeting that was to do with vidcon but i
[1168.56 --> 1173.44]  wasn't at vidcon because i left before vidcon started that sounds like the best way to do vidcon
[1173.44 --> 1181.44]  yeah like hands down it was kind of amazing i had like the best meeting ever i i'm i'm so bad with names
[1181.44 --> 1190.32]  and i'm really embarrassed um and so this sucks but uh cgp gray was there uh tom scott was there um
[1191.28 --> 1197.12]  youtube's head of search and discoverability was there which was really important and there were
[1197.12 --> 1203.36]  definitely some key insights that this is not the kind of meeting that i can go and like make a youtube
[1203.36 --> 1208.24]  video about and tell you guys all about but it was it was really good to just be able to have that kind
[1208.24 --> 1216.08]  of open discussion around the dinner table um there was uh i think her first name's rebecca she's
[1216.08 --> 1224.72]  absolutely huge she does kids content um okay i forget her last name zamolo zamalo something like that um
[1224.72 --> 1231.04]  there was a guy who has a really cool channel that's like tips for creators um there was the guy who did
[1231.04 --> 1242.88]  the uh the arcade arcade tricks or like arcade cheats or something like that arcade hacks um um
[1244.08 --> 1246.96]  cheats or something what's his what's his name
[1249.28 --> 1256.72]  shoot rebecca zamalo yeah yeah that's her so she's it's not the kind of content that i think
[1256.72 --> 1266.16]  you folks would necessarily enjoy but um she's super popular yeah uh dang it i can't i can't find i
[1266.16 --> 1274.64]  can't find him right now uh nobody is nobody is helping me in the chat mark robert mark rober mark
[1274.64 --> 1280.96]  rober he was okay arcade scam science that's yeah yeah yeah so he was there so it was like honestly i
[1280.96 --> 1291.20]  felt kind of b-list um but i think i got an invite just because i cornered one of their execs at um at
[1291.20 --> 1295.76]  the top creator summit and was like asking a bunch of questions and he was just like
[1298.48 --> 1304.00]  we're thinking of having like a dinner come to that and talk to these people directly um so it's really
[1304.00 --> 1310.88]  cool i'm finally getting to the point where we have like a real relationship with youtube actually one
[1311.52 --> 1318.24]  one of the people who was there um got to launch a popular product for the first time in pretty much
[1318.24 --> 1324.48]  forever and that leads really perfectly into one of our topics for today oh um so the head of uh content
[1324.48 --> 1330.88]  id was actually at dinner oh yeah this is cool yeah okay um yeah so the original article here is from the
[1330.88 --> 1340.24]  youtube uh creator's blog and uh he was really excited about this so content id now requires claimants to
[1340.24 --> 1343.12]  provide more information and provides better
[1348.00 --> 1352.88]  there go a bunch of displates that's fine okay cool i mean hey that's the benefit of durable
[1352.88 --> 1358.16]  aluminum wall hangings you can trip and throw them all over the floor and they'll still be okay
[1358.16 --> 1362.72]  they'll be all right are they bent uh no way okay cool no no it's fine don't yeah it wasn't wasn't
[1362.72 --> 1368.88]  that bad didn't sound that bad yeah um anyway so better uh so better uh tools to resolve manual content
[1368.88 --> 1374.56]  id claims so this actually would have solved that drama problem that we had a while back yeah where
[1375.12 --> 1380.80]  our content id system through our mcn was claiming anyone's video that had i think it was either
[1380.80 --> 1386.24]  unigine valley or unigine heaven benchmark in it because we had lots of videos with that first
[1386.24 --> 1392.08]  apparently and then other people uploaded footage and it went yeah that's linus media group's content and
[1392.08 --> 1396.48]  then they had their videos content id claimed which to be clear is not the same thing as a copyright
[1396.48 --> 1400.96]  strike strike yeah and it's actually no big deal once you get it resolved there's no long-term lasting
[1400.96 --> 1408.72]  damage you don't even lose your adsense anyway um now it's way easier to resolve these things so in
[1408.72 --> 1415.04]  the past the copyright claim system had been abused and used to extort creators in some cases
[1416.16 --> 1422.24]  so manual claiming is a tool within content id that allows you to do things like go
[1422.24 --> 1431.84]  uh hey youtube's automated system didn't find this six notes of our song and um you know automatically
[1431.84 --> 1436.56]  flag it so we're gonna go in we're gonna manually say hey that's from our song we actually had this
[1436.56 --> 1441.68]  happen a while back with um a monitor video we had like a meme and it was basically like
[1443.28 --> 1450.72]  and like it was really that short and the owner of that song came in they've created their own tools for
[1450.72 --> 1456.24]  for combing through videos they came in they claimed our entire video based on this like
[1456.80 --> 1463.68]  six to eight notes of music or whatever it was and the way that a a copyright claim works is that once
[1463.68 --> 1469.76]  someone else claims your video the video stays up you lovely folks still get to enjoy it but all of the
[1469.76 --> 1476.40]  money that gets made through adsense on that video goes to that copyright holder even if they had
[1476.40 --> 1484.56]  nothing to do with 99.5 of the video content and it was just that all of the money goes to them which
[1484.56 --> 1490.00]  is obviously not a perfect system but i also understand why it would be that way because
[1490.96 --> 1498.00]  you know you can't just you can't just grab like you know an iconic song like acdc highway to hell or
[1498.00 --> 1506.32]  something and use you know five to ten seconds of it in every one of your videos and expect that that's
[1506.32 --> 1512.08]  okay because you didn't create that that's not yours it doesn't work that way yeah and you also can't
[1512.08 --> 1518.80]  just tell acdc well hey these guys put three hours of black frames at the end of their video which makes
[1518.80 --> 1526.80]  you effectively 0.02 percent of the content so here's your 0.02 percent of the adsense that's not fair
[1526.80 --> 1531.84]  either because clearly you the creator felt you were significantly enhancing your piece of content
[1531.84 --> 1535.92]  by stealing someone else's work or you wouldn't have included it i mean in that case you definitely
[1535.92 --> 1541.12]  did um sorry you definitely did what if you put three hours of black frames oh yeah yeah you're
[1541.12 --> 1548.08]  definitely abusing the system um and you're significantly enhancing your content yeah so so anyway um
[1548.08 --> 1560.32]  um to combat and so so this is this is a move in the creator's direction after a lot of previous moves
[1560.32 --> 1565.44]  that appeared to be designed to help copyright holders enforce their copyright to a degree that
[1566.16 --> 1572.32]  i as a youtuber felt was unfair we ended up having to edit that video and re-upload it without that meme in
[1572.32 --> 1578.16]  it because giving someone else all the adsense from a video that we spend a lot of time and money
[1578.16 --> 1586.32]  creating for their couple seconds of of music doesn't make any sense to us so now uh here's what's
[1586.32 --> 1591.68]  here's what's going on so content id can work automatically by scanning a blah blah blah okay so
[1593.84 --> 1601.28]  um hmm okay jono's notes on this are not amazing but basically starting today and i think that's two
[1601.28 --> 1606.64]  days ago three days ago they are requiring copyright owners to provide time stamps to indicate exactly
[1606.64 --> 1611.52]  where their content appears in the videos that they manually claim which is nice this was a big problem
[1611.52 --> 1618.32]  good start like in that video i watched through the entire video without actually realizing what the
[1618.32 --> 1625.92]  problem was all i could see was that it had been claimed by some music conglomerate and i was like
[1625.92 --> 1630.40]  what are you talking about so i messaged our editor i went yo wtf what happened here
[1630.40 --> 1634.88]  are aren't we using all i think we were on uh warner chapel at the time like aren't we using all
[1634.88 --> 1641.04]  licensed music that we we have rights for and they go yeah and then someone finally clued in i think it
[1641.04 --> 1648.24]  was actually a comment on the video that alerted us to this that that that meme was from a song
[1648.24 --> 1655.84]  like that little portion of it and um so so it wasted a bunch of our time when the claimant could have
[1655.84 --> 1660.96]  just said hey this is the problem now they don't want to do that because that's not actually the
[1660.96 --> 1665.04]  outcome thereafter think about it from their perspective would they rather have you quickly
[1665.04 --> 1668.00]  edit their crap out of your video or would they rather take your money
[1670.72 --> 1675.68]  in the they get 100 of it kind of scheme they definitely just want the money scheme is definitely
[1675.68 --> 1681.68]  the right word here yeah um so they have to provide time stamps now for exactly which part of
[1681.68 --> 1686.56]  your video is manually being claimed and youtube is providing their editing tools to remove the
[1686.56 --> 1692.00]  content claimed manually in your video which will now automatically release the claims this isn't
[1692.00 --> 1698.56]  going to solve all problems no but it should be way more helpful than what they have now yeah so right
[1698.56 --> 1703.76]  now you've got a few different options you can mute all sound when the claimed song plays you can replace
[1703.76 --> 1708.56]  the song if you don't want to mute the audio entirely so you can instead swap out the music with one of
[1708.56 --> 1713.36]  their free to use songs from the youtube audio library um although that might not necessarily
[1713.36 --> 1720.24]  be a perfect solution we actually had someone claim a youtube audio library uh song once because the
[1720.24 --> 1726.72]  performance was licensed by youtube but the actual original sheet music was still copyrighted in germany
[1726.72 --> 1733.76]  of all places anyway or you can trim out the content so you can just cut it out and then an edited version
[1733.76 --> 1738.16]  will show up on youtube after the fact and they are still working on improvements like having
[1738.56 --> 1742.56]  an explicit trim option in the video copyright info page that'll allow you to trim it out with just
[1742.56 --> 1749.44]  one click and uh remember of course that the same tools from before where you could dispute these
[1749.44 --> 1755.36]  claims do still exist if you think the claim is incorrect or covered under fair use or just completely
[1755.36 --> 1760.40]  irrelevant like those unigine valley and unigine heaven claims you can just say hey this is invalid
[1760.40 --> 1766.88]  here's the reason i think so and we've actually found that most of the time um like wanshow uh we've been
[1766.88 --> 1772.40]  flagged on wanshow a lot of times back when we used to show game trailers yeah uh we've been flagged by
[1772.40 --> 1777.04]  the game trailer owners and i'm kind of sitting here going you effing serious mate so dumb you're
[1777.04 --> 1782.80]  gonna take our money for promoting your sorry we advertised yeah sorry for the free promotion dumbass
[1783.92 --> 1790.48]  um so we've actually disputed those in the past saying i'm sure this was an accident no one in their
[1790.48 --> 1795.68]  right mind at nintendo would be mad that we showed their trailer nintendo definitely gets salty about that
[1795.68 --> 1801.52]  um i actually do think that nintendo was one that did not release it and i'm sure they were i'm
[1801.52 --> 1806.40]  looking at it going like you guys are just idiots because we are just never ever ever going to talk
[1806.40 --> 1810.96]  about one of your new games again they're getting good job slightly better at this over time getting
[1810.96 --> 1817.76]  slightly better but like wow yeah yeah it's like how stupid do you have to be to get mad at someone
[1817.76 --> 1822.56]  for promoting a trailer for your content this is an awesome looking game check it out flagged then we
[1822.56 --> 1826.64]  might not have said it looked awesome we probably did it's a nintendo game we probably did we're both
[1826.64 --> 1832.80]  they're basically all awesome yeah um on the subject of nintendo one more topic before we do our sponsors
[1832.80 --> 1836.88]  uh switch light yay or nay yay absolutely you know what you know what i'm gonna do it i'm gonna
[1836.88 --> 1846.32]  attempt the gods oh geez oh no here it is oh no no wait no i did no hard bail no forget it no we'll see
[1846.32 --> 1851.20]  if his shoe takes the whole video yeah we'll see we'll see if we give up all of our adsense over that what do
[1851.20 --> 1856.72]  you think do you disagree with me um i don't i wasn't listening i was busy oh i said yay you said yay
[1856.72 --> 1863.36]  yeah why uh it's considerably cheaper it's a hundred dollars cheaper and it's effectively a 3ds replacement
[1864.24 --> 1872.56]  okay which like they weren't gonna keep going with 3ds and we've known that for a long time okay so
[1872.56 --> 1874.16]  i'm gonna say
[1876.80 --> 1883.84]  it's complicated okay i see we're going here okay so go ahead yeah yeah yeah
[1885.52 --> 1888.96]  these prices are all over the place for one so i'm not 100 sure what's going on there the one that i
[1888.96 --> 1894.80]  saw that's price competitive with the switch light i would be concerned about used switches are a little
[1894.80 --> 1901.04]  bit sketchy that's true because they could be blacklisted they could be blacklisted they have
[1901.04 --> 1906.08]  an exposed screen uh it's fairly likely for the screens to be scratched especially if people were
[1906.08 --> 1909.76]  not very careful careful with docking them yeah and that's going to be something that might be a
[1909.76 --> 1916.56]  little bit visually hard to tell in an ebay ad uh it has a not very easily user replaceable battery
[1916.56 --> 1923.92]  yeah so i would be a little bit concerned about that um and i don't think the fact that you can ebay
[1924.80 --> 1931.04]  something that is used for a comparable price that a new thing is like null and void
[1932.08 --> 1937.84]  no but maybe an enthusiast can take it factor in a purchasing decision for me i'm not going to
[1937.84 --> 1941.92]  purchase a switch light okay i think it's cool that it's on the market here's my other main problem
[1941.92 --> 1952.48]  yeah that's bestbuy.com so that's us pricing sure um so to me effectively what nintendo has done here
[1952.48 --> 1956.16]  is they've knocked a hundred dollars off the price and you're getting the same gaming hardware so
[1956.16 --> 1960.64]  you're gonna have the same gaming experience that you had at least on mobile anyway the battery life
[1960.64 --> 1965.20]  is a little longer is it as far as i know it's an updated chip set i think it's a new tiger chip i
[1965.20 --> 1969.60]  believe so so the battery life is a little bit longer the controllers are fixed so they're stuck on
[1969.60 --> 1974.40]  the side and i believe the screen's a little smaller uh i don't know about the screen i'm not sure but
[1974.40 --> 1978.48]  okay so here's my problem is they dropped a hundred dollars off the price yes that's nice
[1979.52 --> 1987.76]  but you are giving up a lot and giving up tv docking and removable controllers some of it you have the
[1987.76 --> 1994.00]  ability to get back like for example there are games that you cannot play on the switch light like
[1994.00 --> 2001.20]  mario party for example mario party requires joy cons so if you can connect joy cons to switch light of
[2001.20 --> 2009.04]  course you can for 70 dollars oh yeah okay but you said you cannot play so now you've spent 270
[2010.16 --> 2021.28]  it is another 30 30 bucks to get the one that just has all the functionality that's where i run into
[2021.28 --> 2028.80]  trouble this is a this is a console that is a switch no it's doesn't offer all the same experiences it's
[2028.80 --> 2031.68]  more like a game boy it's not really a console
[2034.64 --> 2040.80]  yes it doesn't dock i know you can't play it on tv i know i know it's not really designed i hear you
[2040.80 --> 2046.88]  it's not really designed for mario party for 30 bucks look i've i've played more mario party on the
[2046.88 --> 2052.80]  switch portably than i have on my tv oh that's kind of weird on the plane why do you play mario party on
[2052.80 --> 2059.12]  you play mario party by yourself no with someone with someone okay okay yeah okay yeah i play that
[2059.12 --> 2066.00]  mario party fairly small use case okay that's a niche i don't disagree with you but but there i
[2066.00 --> 2070.24]  mean there's other nintendo acknowledged in their announcement that you can't play one play all of
[2070.24 --> 2074.56]  them yeah yeah like there are games it won't play you got to check the back of the game you get to see
[2074.56 --> 2081.36]  if it supports handheld mode and if it doesn't you are i think the vast majority of games are going
[2081.36 --> 2086.24]  to support it especially mario party forward mario party is a good one to call out because that's a
[2086.24 --> 2090.08]  fairly made i don't know how many people game it's a lot of fun yes i don't know how many people are
[2090.08 --> 2096.00]  into one two switch yeah kind of a trash game no mario party is pretty major yes i will give you that
[2096.00 --> 2101.60]  if i have to run out and spend 70 on top of the fact so here's another problem that i have first
[2101.60 --> 2108.48]  party nintendo games are freaking expensive so when we're talking about the price difference between
[2109.04 --> 2117.92]  a switch and a switch light we're talking one and a half games yeah but at the same time like if you're
[2117.92 --> 2124.16]  a kid that one and a half games might be too much yeah that's and then you should probably go buy a
[2124.16 --> 2131.20]  you should probably go try to very much snipe a good deal on a used switch somewhere else i do agree
[2131.20 --> 2137.44]  with that not everyone's going to do that a lot of moms are not going to buy you a used switch a lot
[2137.44 --> 2142.48]  of moms are not comfortable buying used stuff for their kid who you know even if they're like a like
[2142.48 --> 2149.12]  you know i get this story all the time like hey linus my mom won't let me buy a used gpu on ebay
[2149.12 --> 2156.16]  because she says it's it's it's sketchy i know it's a good deal it's like it's it's one of those brands
[2156.16 --> 2160.88]  that still has that has a user transferable warranty it's literally still under warranty help me convince
[2160.88 --> 2164.24]  her and i'm like look dude there's nothing i can do to help convince you i couldn't convince my
[2164.24 --> 2168.56]  parents you're not going to be able to convince yours i bet yeah my my mom was pretty cool about
[2168.56 --> 2173.84]  that we my brother and i raised money and she drove us to buy a snes from some dude in a parking lot when
[2173.84 --> 2179.68]  i was like 11 or something um but like but not everyone's down with that yeah um i don't think it's
[2179.68 --> 2183.92]  a smoking deal i don't think it's amazing i think it has a place though right a lot of people aren't
[2183.92 --> 2188.88]  going to buy you some people might want to just play fire emblem and smash and literally nothing else
[2189.60 --> 2195.44]  but if you're good okay people will buy a device for that people will buy a console just mobile you
[2195.44 --> 2200.88]  don't want to dock it people will buy a console no well what is invalid what if not you're invalid
[2202.00 --> 2204.40]  what if not docking is i can't even push them
[2205.92 --> 2211.76]  what if not talking the device is brandon brandon please come on he's okay come on this is interesting
[2211.76 --> 2217.36]  okay so so brandon you're a bit of a smash enthusiast yes i like smash and fire emblem
[2217.36 --> 2224.08]  i said those specifically because of brandon okay so we're talking switch versus switch light right
[2224.08 --> 2227.20]  now okay so do you know do you know about the switch yes i know about the switch light of course you do
[2227.20 --> 2236.16]  yeah um obviously we all do um okay so at a hundred dollar delta okay is the switch light a deal
[2238.72 --> 2242.72]  i didn't say it's a smoking deal i said it had a place i think it had yeah i think i agree with luke
[2242.72 --> 2248.64]  i think it has its okay so if you were someone who's only going to play fire emblem and smash yes is it
[2248.64 --> 2254.72]  not worth the extra hundred dollars to be able to dock this isn't fair because brandon has a sweet
[2254.72 --> 2261.68]  couch i just really nice switch i literally bought a switch like last week when before the switch light
[2261.68 --> 2265.92]  came out now thinking back to that decision that i made last week i'd still make this i was gonna say
[2265.92 --> 2271.44]  i think you'd buy it but again he has a nice tv yeah and a really awesome couch a lot of people don't
[2271.44 --> 2277.52]  have it right but you don't need to have a tv easier monitor you can absolutely sure there's so many
[2277.52 --> 2281.76]  monitors but a lot of people are just gonna want to like chill in bed play another thing i see
[2281.76 --> 2289.04]  they do they not have friends a lot of kids don't have uh a yeah why it's a valid question
[2291.20 --> 2297.60]  it's fair but like i just smash by themselves sometimes that hundred dollar delta will be too much
[2297.60 --> 2303.04]  that's true overcome but then i i stand by my argument that that you should go buy a used but some
[2303.04 --> 2307.20]  people can't because you're gonna you're okay you might not need joy cons
[2307.20 --> 2312.80]  eventually but okay here's another thing too like if you want to talk resale value the switch
[2313.28 --> 2317.92]  is going to hold its value it's going to hold some of that value when it's time to flip it and get a
[2317.92 --> 2323.52]  switch to be fair basically all nintendo products hold value very well and and the accessories except
[2323.52 --> 2330.56]  for like the weird so accessories for for original wii okay so i i was picking no they some of them not bad
[2330.56 --> 2335.12]  like the tennis racket things okay no no not that stuff that's what i'm talking like we motes yeah yeah we
[2335.12 --> 2340.48]  motion plus wiimotes still hold value yeah the wii u i was picking up a wii u a little while ago
[2340.48 --> 2345.76]  because one of our wii's like was having some kind of issue and i was like oh you know what forget it
[2345.76 --> 2350.40]  let's just get a wii u anyway and then i can do that data transfer thing and then i don't have to
[2350.40 --> 2355.84]  worry about the wii dying and taking all my uh you know classic arcade whatever these virtual console
[2355.84 --> 2359.92]  games with it and all that kind of stuff so we got it and i was like shocked at how much a wii u still
[2359.92 --> 2365.60]  cost because because of the way that nintendo manages their ip and they have these unique games
[2365.60 --> 2369.84]  these unique gaming experiences the wii u tablet controller still feels amazing yeah so they've got
[2369.84 --> 2374.32]  these unique experiences that are available their their consoles hold their value i would make the
[2374.32 --> 2380.72]  argument that a switch light is going to go like that compared to a switch which will still hold some
[2380.72 --> 2385.28]  value comparatively i i still think it'll hold this value better than a lot of things yeah but yeah i do
[2385.28 --> 2391.36]  agree with that in general i think um i do think like i think you're maybe underestimating the hundred
[2391.36 --> 2397.12]  dollar delta yeah for a lot of kids that's a really big deal it's big my problem is that potentially a
[2397.12 --> 2402.88]  year but it's gonna bite you later it's gonna bite you when you need joy cons it's gonna bite you when
[2402.88 --> 2407.68]  you have to also going to eventually go on sale get comboed with a game okay something like that okay
[2407.68 --> 2416.72]  now that's a different conversation if it comes with fire emblem and it's like 229 now we're talking
[2416.72 --> 2422.24]  a two game difference in price but right now it is a one and a half game right yeah right now but it's
[2422.88 --> 2428.08]  i think that's still significant enough to make people accept these sacrifices yeah they are they
[2428.08 --> 2432.96]  are sacrifices in a lot of cases the increased battery life is really nice and that might be enough for
[2432.96 --> 2438.72]  some people because charging the switch is actually a huge pain it is um i've already noticed this the
[2438.72 --> 2444.64]  switch being fully mobile is actually very annoying it is yeah how's it a pain charging the switch is
[2444.64 --> 2448.88]  his battery life is not very good yeah it's battery life is terrible yeah but i mean okay so maybe i
[2448.88 --> 2453.84]  maybe i'm a unique case so now you're throwing in i surprisingly expensive battery banks well hold on a
[2453.84 --> 2460.00]  second i find okay so let me think first you know what though one thing i use my laptop charger
[2460.00 --> 2466.56]  so i carry one usb type c yeah i carry my razor blade stealth laptop charger which does my phone
[2466.56 --> 2471.12]  my switch and my laptop and they all last for long enough that i don't need to plug all three of them
[2471.12 --> 2478.88]  this kid that was barely able to save up for it has a razor blade with a usb c charging i'm just saying
[2478.88 --> 2485.68]  i haven't found charging the device to be a problem yeah it's a little awkward a lot of people who buy a
[2485.68 --> 2490.80]  switch light are not going to go along and also buy a lot of the stuff that you need to make like
[2490.80 --> 2497.28]  that could make the switch tv version better that's true and so like a switch light is a good solution
[2497.28 --> 2501.68]  because like they're not going to spend like because i think i i spent like another hundred dollars on
[2501.68 --> 2506.80]  little things like sd cards and like like a pro controller yeah like like no people who buy this
[2506.80 --> 2510.72]  which aren't gonna buy that so that's the thing when you buy a switch for the for your tv you're buying a
[2510.72 --> 2516.48]  lot of other stuff on top of that yeah a lot of the time over time and like a switch light you just
[2516.48 --> 2521.20]  kind of and you're trying to like just play right away somewhat bridge the gap all right thanks brennan
[2521.20 --> 2525.60]  by buying some of those things like additional controllers and stuff and i think you have to assume
[2525.60 --> 2529.44]  if you're going for a switch light you're probably buying nothing in addition other than games
[2529.44 --> 2533.92]  all right well that's fair enough so you're in your good the plan is to invest a lot less in the
[2533.92 --> 2538.32]  ecosystem and if i was a parent maybe i'd get my kids a switch light so that they don't have to
[2538.32 --> 2545.20]  ask me for a pro controller and honestly that might sell a bunch of these if the people are
[2545.20 --> 2550.56]  educated enough in the ecosystem to go like okay yeah it can't connect to the tv it can't do all
[2550.56 --> 2556.48]  these other things or if i don't want my kids on my tv or that so okay all right i think it has a place
[2556.48 --> 2560.56]  i don't think it's a stunning value i don't think people should run out and buy it right now because
[2560.56 --> 2564.64]  it's amazing i think if you're interested i would probably wait until it gets bundled with a game
[2564.64 --> 2571.76]  with a game yeah with a game okay without a game i think it's a i think it's a tough sell for me
[2571.76 --> 2577.28]  i don't think it's a great deal i don't like i think it's interesting i don't like saving a dollar
[2578.00 --> 2584.96]  so that i can spend two later okay but a hundred us dollars when you were 13 yeah it's a lot of money
[2585.68 --> 2589.60]  but when i know you probably would have bounced when i was and i probably would have done the same thing
[2589.60 --> 2595.60]  i bought low sold high i was flipping stuff on craigslist like i was hustling yeah so i had a
[2595.60 --> 2601.84]  job like i don't feel bad yeah for people that can't raise a hundred dollars because they're like
[2601.84 --> 2608.72]  too young to neither do i because again i had a job but uh i can understand why they might want to buy
[2608.72 --> 2615.04]  something now to be clear that thing i just said just now could sound very out of touch to be clear i don't
[2615.04 --> 2621.76]  feel bad for like suburban lower to upper middle class kids yeah that can't scrape together a hundred
[2621.76 --> 2627.44]  dollars if you came from where we came from yes then you should be able to yeah but if you're someone
[2627.44 --> 2633.68]  who is in a situation where like you can't you don't even have time to go to school because you are like
[2633.68 --> 2637.44]  working to support your family at 12 or whatever that's a completely different situation i wasn't
[2637.44 --> 2643.04]  supporting my family with my job i was buying everquest subscriptions and video games
[2643.04 --> 2647.20]  so i just want to make sure that that's really clear yes um
[2649.76 --> 2654.32]  that can be just just for those of you who are tuning in late we have no idea why the stream is
[2654.32 --> 2658.96]  lagging on youtube it's fine on twitch it is literally exactly the same stream so actually still
[2658.96 --> 2663.12]  lags a little bit on twitch but it is considerably better oh okay so yeah we'll we'll have to figure
[2663.12 --> 2668.80]  that out later yeah uh we think it's haunted um just wanted to run through the sponsors for you guys
[2668.80 --> 2672.72]  holy crap we are 45 minutes into the show and we haven't talked about sponsors anthony did you want to
[2672.72 --> 2676.80]  jump in with something you were kind of standing there patiently yeah i was just going to say that
[2676.80 --> 2681.92]  the uh the 199 price for the switch light yeah is basically what the 3ds used to cost when it first
[2681.92 --> 2689.28]  came out right so to me that means that it's the new 3ds okay yeah luke said that yeah like to me it's
[2690.32 --> 2696.16]  i would buy it because it's more portable it is smaller oh it is smaller yeah okay yeah it's small it's
[2696.16 --> 2700.88]  less like much smaller like my joy cons don't stick really well anymore it's like a six point
[2700.88 --> 2705.04]  something to 5.5 inch so like it's actually a smaller okay so it's quite a bit smaller
[2707.36 --> 2710.32]  but it's so okay so it's still like sort of pocketable
[2711.20 --> 2716.32]  uh depending on the size of your pocket yeah you need a pretty epic pocket no i don't think so
[2716.96 --> 2725.92]  uh maybe it takes my entire hand yeah you probably up to like here all right mr big boy pockets here
[2726.16 --> 2734.88]  um all right i got them thick pockets sponsors for today see sonic see sonic yes we're doing it nick
[2735.52 --> 2744.80]  um see sonic has lots of fantastic power supply products uh featuring features like wow these are
[2744.80 --> 2750.88]  really confusing things okay so i they have up to 80 plus titanium efficiency the highest or is this a
[2750.88 --> 2758.32]  specific skew we're talking about yes it is but it's not in here dang it you guys um where's the is
[2758.32 --> 2766.64]  it here okay i don't think so i blame john o and colton so some there's some product from see sonic
[2766.64 --> 2773.52]  80 plus titanium efficiency um so that's between 91 and 94 efficiency at all times
[2773.52 --> 2778.32]  um it has their lambda noise level a plus plus so the noise output stays below 20 decibels during
[2778.32 --> 2783.52]  operation it's got a fluid dynamic bearing fan uh with premium hybrid fan control so the fan actually
[2783.52 --> 2789.36]  turns off when it's under a very low load it's got their micro tolerance load regulation uh it comes
[2789.36 --> 2793.92]  with a 12-year warranty and you can check it out at see sonic's website or at amazon in the link in
[2793.92 --> 2800.08]  the video description is johnno looking for it are you looking for the power supply that is the sponsor
[2800.08 --> 2806.08]  for today we use it for video oh we used it for a video the link okay okay okay see sonic prime
[2806.08 --> 2815.28]  titanium 850 i went through the link and found it all right uh also sponsoring the show today ridge
[2815.28 --> 2819.20]  wallet oh that's funny i was talking about how ridge wallet might be a sponsor and then they were i guess
[2819.20 --> 2822.80]  that's why it's sitting here i thought maybe someone just left it here no so the ridge wallet lets you
[2822.80 --> 2828.56]  stop carrying pointless garbage around in your pocket receipts old hotel room keys spent gift cards all
[2828.56 --> 2835.76]  that kind of stuff if you don't have the space for it then it's a little bit easier to break the habit
[2835.76 --> 2840.32]  so the ridge wallet is designed with two metal plates that are bound by a strong elastic band
[2840.32 --> 2846.72]  to keep your cards tightly together but still easily accessible they've got a uh belt clip on them or
[2846.72 --> 2850.88]  you can just slip it into your pocket it's actually pretty smooth so you're not going to have you're
[2850.88 --> 2855.68]  not going to find it like getting caught on things if you decide not to use the clip and they are lifetime
[2855.68 --> 2861.28]  guaranteed they're also rfid blocking so you they can't people can't use like those card skimmers in
[2861.28 --> 2865.44]  order to uh grab your data out of your pocket but i will say i'm going to interject here for one
[2865.44 --> 2872.00]  second uh if you need rfid to access something yeah the way that you would be outside of your ridge
[2872.00 --> 2876.16]  hole well no no the way that you eject cards is actually really simple and if you just put that
[2876.16 --> 2881.20]  card on the edge you just shove it out with your thumb tap shove it back in you're done it's actually
[2881.20 --> 2885.84]  faster in my opinion than than many normal they come in different materials like aluminum carbon fiber and
[2885.84 --> 2890.40]  titanium and they're a great gift for father's day which is a month ago thanks for having me
[2890.40 --> 2896.80]  i noticed that i noticed that so you can use offer code ltt at ridgewallet.com slash ltt and you
[2896.80 --> 2905.60]  can save 10 on your very own ridge wallet cash clip oh that's a cash clip well whatever i would use
[2905.60 --> 2913.20]  i've used it as a bell clip and it worked great uh okay there we go in other news savage jerky is also
[2913.20 --> 2916.48]  sponsoring the show today and actually still have a little bit of sriracha bacon left over where are
[2916.48 --> 2923.76]  you going oh we've got the hot sauce i'm showing their other fantastic products so their jerky is
[2923.76 --> 2928.40]  made with high quality ingredients without nitrates or preservatives with the goal of creating a snack
[2928.40 --> 2931.76]  that is full of flavor and spice that isn't bad for you i was actually doing some research on nitrates
[2931.76 --> 2938.32]  they're really bad yeah i had like hadn't really thought about it much before but so nitrates uh make it much
[2938.32 --> 2945.84]  faster to age meat and get that desirable delicious looking color um but they're a carcinogen which is
[2945.84 --> 2950.56]  cool well also we have a lot of meat well actually no sorry just to be clear the the nitrates are not
[2950.56 --> 2955.92]  the carcinogen it's the reaction between the nitrates and something something that creates a carcinogen
[2957.28 --> 2962.40]  so they've got 13 different flavors of jerky like their sriracha bacon and their maple buffalo bacon which i
[2962.40 --> 2968.96]  love that one's got a little bit more kick than the maple buffalo i kind of went down the wrong pipe
[2968.96 --> 2975.20]  i'm good though they also make barbecue sauce hot sauce and a spice rub and uh i love their hot sauce
[2975.20 --> 2979.20]  man their hot sauce is amazing it's like really good you guys should check it out um use offer code ltt
[2979.20 --> 2986.32]  to save 10 on all their products at the link below all right do we have any other important topics today
[2986.32 --> 2991.84]  i kind of feel like we covered all the uh really important stuff the major things the google employees
[2991.84 --> 2997.68]  secretly listening in thing is pretty interesting now we got to talk about the um the pcie gen 4
[2997.68 --> 3002.00]  compatibility drama i want to throw in a thing for this really quick at some point okay let's do it
[3002.00 --> 3006.00]  now let's do it now okay so google employees secretly listening we don't really have to go into this too
[3006.00 --> 3013.36]  deeply in my opinion um there's google employees that are listening in to um google home data and
[3013.36 --> 3017.68]  listening to conversations including conversations that were definitely not intentionally triggered
[3018.72 --> 3025.52]  um i'm sure this is happening with all of them i was talking to wendell at uh computex we talked
[3025.52 --> 3029.76]  about a ton of stuff wendell's an amazing person it's very fun hanging out with him but uh one of the
[3029.76 --> 3035.04]  things we started talking about is there's uh someone has designed or a group of people i don't remember
[3035.04 --> 3041.04]  sorry i didn't remember the story until i saw this this exact topic but they designed this 3d printed
[3041.04 --> 3046.56]  housing that you can put on i believe it was for an alexa but you could probably put it on a you
[3046.56 --> 3051.60]  could probably modify it to go on a google home as well that like covers it and then has a little i
[3051.60 --> 3055.84]  believe if i remember correctly it has a little speaker in it that constantly blares noise at it
[3056.88 --> 3061.84]  and it's called a brain well it's playfully called a brain slug because that plays onto something from
[3061.84 --> 3064.96]  a show that i don't remember and people get really mad at me but i think it's rick and morty
[3064.96 --> 3071.44]  um so basically it's constantly blasting like white noise is it futurama future might be oh i think
[3071.44 --> 3077.28]  it's future yeah uh it's constantly blasting white noise and the brain slug is now listening for you
[3077.28 --> 3082.56]  but it's all local stuff it doesn't call out to external servers so if you say the keywords the
[3082.56 --> 3087.36]  brain slug wants to hear the brain slug will stop blasting noise and then you can talk to your
[3087.36 --> 3093.60]  automation device wow and that's actually awesome that is next level i think that is so cool and i've
[3093.60 --> 3097.52]  i've wanted to make one for a while even though i don't run these devices i just want to make one
[3097.52 --> 3102.08]  because i think they're cool um and i probably screwed some things up and i'm sorry wendell and
[3102.08 --> 3110.00]  whoever made that project but super cool so this is pretty funny um google's defense of this behavior
[3110.00 --> 3119.68]  was that only 0.2 of all audio clips are being used that's a lot that's a huge amount that's one in
[3119.68 --> 3125.76]  every 500. that that means i guarantee like not technically guaranteed but it's extremely likely
[3125.76 --> 3131.76]  that i have something in here of me going set a reminder for but you know my herpes appointment or
[3133.52 --> 3139.76]  but that's the thing okay luke has a highly recognizable voice so let's say that he did set
[3139.76 --> 3144.16]  an embarrassing reminder or something like that even if he was intending to talk to his assistant yeah
[3144.16 --> 3152.00]  it's a personal assistant yeah not a hey i'd love for someone in uh in a data center somewhere to
[3152.00 --> 3157.28]  really like listen to this and go wow is that luke lafreniere the conversation with wendell came up
[3157.28 --> 3161.28]  because i was talking about how i don't like these services because i would love to have something local
[3161.28 --> 3168.72]  and how a long time ago i had spun up this project to try to uh mesh together a whole bunch of microphones
[3168.72 --> 3175.68]  in my house and have them dictate to a file that i was going to be constantly reading to see for my
[3175.68 --> 3179.20]  own keywords and triggering events on my own and all this kind of stuff but it's quite a long time
[3179.20 --> 3182.96]  ago and he actually said there's a bunch of projects that i would be able to use to accomplish
[3182.96 --> 3187.76]  it a lot easier now which is very cool again talking to wendell is always fantastic but um that's
[3187.76 --> 3193.20]  how we got onto this thing because these are so they're so creepy uh nick you've been standing here
[3193.20 --> 3197.36]  very patiently do you want to talk to the uh the wandshow yeah i mean for a minute i thought you're
[3197.36 --> 3205.84]  gonna say luke has herpes not that i know of have you talked about your super fashionable t-shirt
[3205.84 --> 3210.72]  that you're wearing no i haven't yet oh well that's now the top selling t-shirt in the lightest
[3213.12 --> 3217.60]  really above hard drive i actually like hard drive better hard drive has only been on sale half as long
[3217.60 --> 3222.88]  oh okay uh yeah so there you go processor t-shirt it's for sale it's really nice i really like it
[3222.88 --> 3226.80]  there's there's also this one you can also get the elemental shirts which
[3226.80 --> 3232.00]  uh don't sell very well this shirt exists yeah check it out alternatively we're gonna have those
[3232.00 --> 3238.08]  two for 30 at ltx hard drive is hard drive is pretty awesome i really like this one um
[3238.96 --> 3243.76]  what else is there to say we're out of stock of most of the sizes of stealth hoodie are we out of all
[3243.76 --> 3248.08]  of them there's only one there's one stealth there's one stealth hoodie in stock well it says
[3248.08 --> 3253.52]  sold out online so uh they'll be back in stock they'll be back next week and uh hopefully by
[3253.52 --> 3258.64]  next week we will also be launching our underwear oh yeah do you want some underwear yes yeah i bet
[3258.64 --> 3264.16]  you do i've already told them i think i think you'll take anything free oh yeah yes so can i pitch you
[3264.16 --> 3270.72]  something crazy okay to promote the launch of the underwear yeah we do the show naked but wearing
[3270.72 --> 3278.08]  underwear are we like standing no so we'll look naked they can't see them anyways then that's fine
[3278.08 --> 3283.92]  are we gonna ban from twitch i don't know all right nipples well oh how does that work you tape over
[3283.92 --> 3289.36]  so we could paint we could we could paint them because that's a whole section we could wear bras
[3290.72 --> 3294.56]  oh my god we could wear bras we could wear bra okay but hold on a second i i need to know how this
[3294.56 --> 3299.92]  works is actually important because you're a twitch partner so if you show your nipples on someone
[3299.92 --> 3307.52]  else's channel oh does that affect your channel yeah yeah okay so if like dr disrespect showed up on
[3307.52 --> 3312.56]  linus tech yeah and was like streaming in the bathroom or whatever that's on him not me temporarily
[3312.56 --> 3317.28]  banned for cool oh it's on both of us all right yeah all right just just just clearing the air here
[3317.28 --> 3322.00]  just clearing the air so bras all right so bras might be the answer i think actually you're not even
[3322.00 --> 3326.96]  going to be here oh you're not here next week okay next week then we'll find a time um yeah all
[3326.96 --> 3338.16]  right asus publishes x470 and b450 gen 4 compatibility chart so um let's see what this was posted by cb
[3338.16 --> 3346.96]  forum member on the linus tech tips forum and basically amd's official position about pci express gen 4
[3346.96 --> 3356.08]  compatibility has been that only x570 and their ryzen third gen processors together give you the
[3356.08 --> 3364.32]  capability to run pci express gen 4 which is double the speed of pci express gen 3 at the same link width
[3365.60 --> 3373.12]  however asus actually just published a chart of their motherboard so we've got this here on hexis.net
[3373.12 --> 3382.16]  showing that showing that some of their last generation x470 and even their more value-oriented b450
[3382.16 --> 3395.04]  boards have pcie gen 4 support or capability so ironically um none of their rog boards have gen 4 16x support
[3395.04 --> 3404.32]  um so you know that's pretty funny but some of their prime and tough series boards actually do so you could plug a
[3404.32 --> 3412.00]  pcie gen 4 graphics card into your system and get a gen 4 link if you have a ryzen third gen processor installed in it
[3412.32 --> 3420.88]  and actually quite a lot of the boards support pcie gen 4 for the m.2 slot which in my opinion is actually a little bit more
[3420.88 --> 3427.92]  important because pcie gen 4 16x is so far beyond what a graphics card needs at this point in time
[3427.92 --> 3433.36]  outside of some very specialized workloads that faster storage is probably a more practical
[3434.00 --> 3441.28]  use for pci gen pcie gen 4 at this point in time now what i actually don't have any clarification on
[3441.28 --> 3445.68]  at this point because i haven't actually read the article is how this affects the link between the cpu and
[3445.68 --> 3451.84]  the chipset i would imagine that's still a gen 3 link because the chipset itself is not gen 4 capable
[3451.84 --> 3460.96]  to my knowledge but for the rest of it the way that it works is your cpu is just its pci express pins
[3460.96 --> 3468.00]  are just connected to those slots or to that m.2 slot so as long as the signaling quality is sufficient
[3468.00 --> 3474.40]  it can negotiate a gen 4 link on these boards as long as the device on the other end is pcie gen 4 it's
[3474.40 --> 3480.72]  just it's just copper like that's what it is it's copper now the way that they route the traces has
[3480.72 --> 3486.00]  to be better for pcie gen 4 so that you avoid interference and that's why asus is saying well
[3486.00 --> 3492.16]  hey look these boards aren't going to handle it because of whatever reason or if you had something
[3492.16 --> 3499.12]  like a pci express uh switch or something if that doesn't have gen 4 capability you're not going to
[3499.12 --> 3503.60]  you're not going to be able to necessarily handle actually i don't know how would a plx chip be affected
[3503.60 --> 3507.04]  by that i would think it would have to be natively gen 4 don't quote me on that maybe i'll have to get
[3507.04 --> 3513.12]  back to you on that anyway the point is it looks like there are some boards with pcie gen 4 capability
[3513.12 --> 3518.16]  from the last generation which kind of eliminates the one key benefit of x570 especially because a
[3518.16 --> 3526.72]  lot of them are passively cooled just like okay so i'm going to bring you back a little bit yeah please
[3526.72 --> 3532.00]  because you just talked about how it's very interesting but something you mentioned at the beginning of the
[3532.00 --> 3538.56]  show was the controversy problem where a lot of people are going oh cool but you think if it was
[3538.56 --> 3543.68]  the other team they would be getting really mad yeah so intel had something similar where they had a
[3543.68 --> 3551.60]  line of chips um that and i'm gonna screw up the code names coffee lake so they had a line of chips that
[3551.60 --> 3558.88]  could have worked on their z170 and z270 boards and intel decided to say no they're not compatible and
[3558.88 --> 3568.48]  um because while some boards would have worked um and that was proven enthusiast members of the
[3568.48 --> 3574.96]  community got coffee lake chips working by spoofing ids or masking pins or doing whatever funny things
[3574.96 --> 3579.44]  that the community does i love you guys so much you're amazing um so they actually made coffee lake
[3579.44 --> 3586.88]  chips work on previous generation boards and so i guess this is just so i said that at the beginning of the
[3586.88 --> 3590.40]  show but i'm actually not sure that i agree with it anymore doesn't fully feel the same yeah there's
[3590.40 --> 3596.56]  a bit of a difference in the way that they handled it so amd still has time to pull an intel on this
[3596.56 --> 3603.84]  and lock it down like manually lock it down which is what intel did but the stance that amd is taking
[3603.84 --> 3608.96]  here is not actually that different where they're saying look because we don't want to create confusion
[3608.96 --> 3618.88]  in the in the marketplace we're just going to say x570 yes everything else no that's it and that's
[3618.88 --> 3625.04]  exactly what intel did because there were previous generation boards that wouldn't work with it either
[3625.04 --> 3631.52]  because the vrm design wasn't good enough or any other number of reasons they said well then nothing
[3631.52 --> 3636.80]  because our compatibility matrix cannot be that complicated because you got to remember and this is a
[3636.80 --> 3642.80]  little funky you would kind of expect top the line rog boards to support it and the fact that they
[3642.80 --> 3647.60]  don't is weird and kind of confusing yeah the fact that the lower end ones the fact that the like tough
[3647.60 --> 3653.68]  and prime boards do is like okay so by keeping the message simple hey the new gen works the old one
[3653.68 --> 3659.44]  doesn't you avoid ticking off the customer who just spent four hundred dollars on a crosshair whatever
[3660.08 --> 3666.56]  and now has less functionality today than the b450 guy than the b450 guy that saved a buck last time
[3666.80 --> 3672.32]  um which like i mean that's great and it's cool that they have support but i totally understand
[3672.32 --> 3676.72]  why this would be confusing it's like the inverse of what you'd expect and keeping the messaging clean
[3676.72 --> 3682.16]  can be the best bet a lot of the time because um i mean a perfect example of this is giveaways you guys
[3682.16 --> 3686.48]  might have noticed we don't do a lot of giveaways on our channel the reason for that is that for every
[3686.48 --> 3693.68]  one person that you make happy you piss off 10 000 oh yeah and so for someone like an intel or an amd
[3693.68 --> 3699.04]  for every one enthusiast that they make happy by enabling this feature and optane was another one
[3699.84 --> 3705.04]  where it could have been backported to older generation boards but they didn't because they
[3705.04 --> 3710.40]  didn't want to make it confusing for every enthusiast that you please out of the last generation you are
[3710.40 --> 3715.36]  going to create a bunch of confusion with normies who don't understand why their stuff doesn't work
[3715.36 --> 3724.16]  um so i get it but i also think amd so far has been better about this in that they are at least
[3724.16 --> 3731.36]  allowing it to work rather than manually locking it off um yeah so something interesting how you
[3731.36 --> 3735.60]  talked about like enabling things can sometimes be bad doing giveaways can sometimes be bad
[3735.60 --> 3742.40]  interesting random little tidbit we added casting to the app but it was in a known somewhat buggy state
[3742.40 --> 3746.96]  but it would probably work for a lot of people and we're like oh we can release this version it says
[3746.96 --> 3750.96]  that it's an alpha every single time we release a new version of the app there's a big pop-up
[3750.96 --> 3756.40]  talking about everything and we say specifically in there casting might be buggy average ratings for
[3756.40 --> 3763.04]  the app went down when we added casting as a feature because people were like hey casting doesn't work
[3763.04 --> 3769.92]  bam get wrecked instead of people going like oh five star it'll be cool when more features come
[3769.92 --> 3774.56]  them now they're going like feature got here didn't fully work even though you said it might not
[3774.56 --> 3779.68]  get wrecked and it's like it's interesting i'm not complaining it's just an interesting observation
[3779.68 --> 3784.48]  yeah that sometimes giving people something is not actually great because if it doesn't work properly
[3784.48 --> 3789.92]  or someone else or if someone else doesn't get it or whatever it's going to create animosity and that
[3789.92 --> 3794.88]  makes sense um it was just it was a really interesting observation so you can be app i'm going to throw
[3794.88 --> 3802.32]  this in here really quick ios app is like very much on the way it just takes so much longer to do
[3802.32 --> 3809.28]  anything in relation to apple than it does with google holy crap our app has to be manually reviewed
[3810.40 --> 3815.84]  by like a person and i have to like give them a write-up explaining the app and how it works and all
[3815.84 --> 3822.32]  this kind of stuff that they have to read before it can be test flighted for like not even actual release
[3822.32 --> 3827.28]  and then we have to do that and then we're going to have to actually release it at which point i
[3827.28 --> 3832.24]  believe it has to be manually reviewed again but i'm not certain on that and it's going to take like
[3832.24 --> 3836.16]  a few business days to get manually reviewed so it's coming
[3838.16 --> 3844.24]  i don't know exactly when because it's kind of in their court but it's on the way yeah all right
[3845.04 --> 3850.32]  want to go play some video games yeah let's do it all right so food's here yeah heck yeah all
[3850.32 --> 3854.00]  right so we're heading to the lounge uh good night ladies and gentlemen see you again next week same
[3854.00 --> 3858.64]  bad time same bad channel bye hey wait you're going to do something next week should people be like
[3859.20 --> 3866.24]  looking out for you there uh i'll be at iam chicago yeah yeah so luke's going to be there um intel
[3866.24 --> 3869.92]  sponsoring you yeah if i recall correctly so i don't i think i'm building a computer or something
[3870.48 --> 3875.20]  uh you're doing some streams i think in panels cool so guys check him out he's going to be at iam in
[3875.20 --> 3879.36]  chicago don't miss it if you're going to iam in chicago yeah otherwise i'm not going to say like
[3879.36 --> 3883.68]  get on a flight to see this guy because if you're going to do that come to lts yeah i was literally
