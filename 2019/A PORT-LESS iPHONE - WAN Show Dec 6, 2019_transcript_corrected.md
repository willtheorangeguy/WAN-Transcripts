[0.64 → 7.60] All right, welcome to the WAN show, ladies and gentlemen, having one heck of a time getting
[7.60 → 9.46] the new live dashboard set up.
[9.68 → 11.02] It was amazing.
[11.30 → 14.56] It works so well that I can't even believe it.
[14.84 → 16.86] We have a great show for you guys today.
[17.02 → 23.62] We're going to be talking about the rumour that the 2021 iPhone will be completely portless.
[24.16 → 25.00] We will be running...
[25.00 → 26.14] Sorry, did you say completely pointless?
[26.46 → 26.92] Portless.
[27.00 → 27.42] Oh, okay.
[27.62 → 29.06] My voice is dead.
[29.06 → 31.42] I have been...
[31.42 → 33.02] It can be both at the same time.
[33.04 → 33.78] Yeah, it could be both.
[34.22 → 37.52] We're going to be talking through the later case scandal.
[37.86 → 39.10] What exactly happened?
[39.58 → 40.26] What else we got?
[40.38 → 46.80] Oh, there's a new chipset VR platform for VR brought to us by Qualcomm, the XR2.
[47.02 → 47.70] So we're going to talk about that.
[47.80 → 48.86] That's a main topic?
[49.30 → 50.70] Well, I thought you liked VR.
[50.92 → 51.84] It can not be.
[51.98 → 54.56] We can talk about Intel resuscitating Hasbro for some reason.
[54.72 → 55.16] Wait, what?
[55.20 → 56.98] Chips from 2013, baby.
[56.98 → 58.56] What?
[58.62 → 60.22] They're like manufacturing these again?
[60.80 → 61.66] It's back.
[62.44 → 62.84] All right.
[62.90 → 63.88] Let's roll the intro.
[63.88 → 68.88] You'll have to give me a couple more minutes.
[68.96 → 70.04] How long is this clip going to be?
[72.20 → 72.60] Yeah.
[72.94 → 73.16] Oh.
[74.24 → 74.72] Five?
[78.16 → 78.52] Okay.
[79.18 → 80.76] What's our conclusion?
[81.42 → 82.36] Is it a decent value?
[86.70 → 87.42] Ridge wallet.
[87.42 → 89.50] See Sonic.
[91.50 → 93.02] Displayed.
[93.02 → 95.30] Ah.
[95.42 → 96.00] All right.
[96.14 → 99.60] So why don't we jump into our headline topic right away.
[99.74 → 106.08] According to securities analyst Ming-Chi Duo, who is well known for his Apple product predictions,
[106.56 → 111.52] Apple is planning to release its first iPhone without the lightning charging port in 2021.
[111.52 → 129.64] Now, a lot of people would have maybe assumed seeing news like that, the way that I just presented it, that Apple was finally at long last going to adopt USB Type-C, which they already have adopted on their laptops and their iPads.
[129.72 → 130.30] We don't talk about that.
[130.30 → 135.86] Just laptops and iPads on the iPhone.
[136.84 → 137.40] But no.
[137.56 → 138.48] That's not what this is.
[138.98 → 145.20] The shift is part of an effort by Apple to further distinguish its most expensive iPhone from other new smartphones, according to Duo.
[145.20 → 148.66] And Duo, however you're, I'm sorry, my voice is fried.
[148.72 → 149.34] I can't even try.
[149.34 → 160.18] And so that suggests that the phone will not have any port, no charging port at all, and would require that owners charge it wirelessly.
[161.46 → 168.56] Not only that, not only charge it wirelessly, but also use any wireless peripherals, like only wireless headphones.
[168.70 → 168.90] Right.
[169.00 → 169.72] Forget a dongle.
[170.06 → 170.28] Right.
[170.28 → 174.36] Forget having like a FLIR camera dongle or any other like pro level dongle.
[174.46 → 177.64] What if you need, yeah, what if you need to give a presentation in a boardroom or something?
[177.70 → 180.86] I've seen people use their iPhones for that just with a lightning to HDMI connector.
[180.90 → 186.90] It really doesn't make any sense, especially considering that the way that this is framed, and again, this is just a rumour.
[187.00 → 188.08] This is just someone's speculation.
[188.26 → 193.32] The way it's framed, it's like they want their top, top, top iPhone to have this.
[193.56 → 195.24] This is a removal of features.
[195.56 → 199.74] And the last keynote we saw from them was like, you know, we take the word pro seriously.
[199.74 → 203.52] And the iPhone 11 Pro, it's really a pro tool with these three cameras.
[204.12 → 214.16] You're telling me pros are just going to use like wireless microphones or just like nothing that you don't want it to be like a hub where you can put on all these extra extensions into?
[214.66 → 215.36] I don't know.
[215.40 → 221.42] It's very baffling to me because, you know, Apple's vision of pro even a few short years ago was dongles everywhere.
[221.88 → 223.80] Whereas now it's wireless everywhere.
[223.80 → 234.40] The problem with that is that unless wireless technology leaps forward very significantly in the next, well, year, wireless isn't pro.
[234.94 → 239.44] Well, they've got two years because a 2021 iPhone wouldn't be until September 2021.
[239.44 → 248.48] I mean, here, one thing, though, is that from what I've heard, 60 gigahertz Wi-Fi should see a significant bump in bandwidth.
[249.26 → 256.22] I was actually researching this because I wanted to know if and when there's a wireless option coming for the Valve Index.
[256.56 → 256.74] Right.
[256.74 → 263.00] So that VR headset that I like so much because 120 to 144 hertz, freaking awesome.
[264.82 → 266.98] And apparently there's a new revision coming.
[267.10 → 279.54] I think it was either next year, which would be 2020 or 2021, that would increase the bandwidth substantially and make it so that the existing 60 hertz, or excuse me, 60 gigahertz wireless technology
[279.54 → 287.78] that's already used on things like the HTC Five would be better enough to handle the additional bandwidth of an index.
[288.10 → 299.08] So if that's the case and this thing could do, you know, 4K 60 wirelessly, you know, Apple has never shied away from saying,
[299.60 → 304.94] well, the way that you used to do it that was affordable and accessible and easy,
[304.94 → 314.78] now we're going to do it a new way that's less affordable, less accessible, and maybe even easier, but definitely more magical.
[315.80 → 320.18] It's definitely magical, but I don't think that it's always easier to use a wireless charging pad.
[320.58 → 321.16] They're finicky.
[321.34 → 322.66] You have to line up in the right spot.
[323.22 → 326.78] And Apple themselves haven't even released their power mat or whatever it's called.
[326.92 → 328.02] Yeah, I think they killed that thing.
[328.08 → 328.90] I forget what they called it.
[328.90 → 336.14] I mean, there are third-party alternatives, but that doesn't change the fact that Apple themselves has acknowledged that the vision of the future
[336.14 → 342.60] where you just, like, chuck your stuff onto a wireless charging mat and everything just charges magically is not there yet.
[342.64 → 344.46] With that said, they're giving themselves another two years.
[344.82 → 346.16] And aren't they trying to be environmentalists?
[346.44 → 349.94] Didn't they say with the last iPhone that it's, like, it's all recycled aluminum or something like that?
[350.34 → 351.92] Wireless charging is less efficient.
[352.30 → 355.38] If you're going to have millions of these users charging the phones less efficiently,
[355.38 → 359.62] you're just leaking out energy into just everywhere.
[360.20 → 362.66] I think that's a tough one to argue.
[362.80 → 368.66] I mean, yeah, it's less efficient, but we're not talking people charging their cars wirelessly.
[369.18 → 370.36] Not yet, but why not?
[370.82 → 371.58] They're trend centres.
[372.00 → 372.98] Industries follow them.
[373.24 → 373.42] Yeah.
[373.54 → 377.60] Well, I mean, people have already talked about wireless charging pads where you just, like, go into your garage.
[378.52 → 379.00] I would...
[379.00 → 381.38] We have to redesign the grid if we're going to do that.
[381.46 → 382.18] I would buy it.
[382.72 → 383.12] Yeah.
[383.50 → 384.30] Everyone will.
[384.30 → 387.66] I would love that so much.
[388.06 → 390.12] What about that Tesla arm thing that were...
[390.12 → 394.72] It just went, like, snaked over autonomously and prehensile and just plugged itself in.
[394.74 → 395.30] Did you see that?
[395.40 → 396.38] Yeah, I did.
[396.46 → 398.46] But that's less...
[398.46 → 403.34] That's more science fiction, whereas, like, pulling into the wireless charger...
[403.34 → 405.62] Elon has made rockets that land themselves.
[406.24 → 407.48] Yeah, that's true.
[407.66 → 409.36] You're telling me you can't make an arm that finds the hole?
[409.50 → 411.28] I'm saying I wouldn't like it.
[412.46 → 413.24] Too creepy?
[413.40 → 413.66] Yeah.
[413.66 → 418.90] What if you put, like, a doll's baby hand on the end and just get it to scratch your back?
[418.94 → 419.44] I don't get it.
[419.46 → 420.74] Are you trying to help or make it worse?
[420.82 → 422.94] It scratches your back.
[422.94 → 423.14] Okay.
[423.14 → 425.50] All right.
[425.50 → 430.58] Okay, the thing with this, though, it's like you're paying more for fewer features.
[430.72 → 431.62] You're getting less.
[432.76 → 433.02] Okay.
[433.16 → 435.26] What if they could make it even more waterproof?
[436.04 → 438.02] What if they gave us something in return?
[438.52 → 440.52] What if these 60 gigahertz...
[440.52 → 441.14] Listen, I'm speculating.
[441.14 → 446.64] What if the 60 gigahertz wireless connectivity really is the most amazing thing since sliced bread?
[446.64 → 450.96] Like, you have a dongle that just has, like, a battery in it.
[450.96 → 454.34] And you just bring it anywhere near your iPhone, and it's like, wow, connected.
[454.54 → 455.62] It's amazing.
[455.62 → 460.64] If that connectivity option would be available on phones that have ports still.
[460.64 → 462.10] Yes.
[463.60 → 467.36] And does anyone really want an iPhone that's that much more waterproof?
[468.10 → 468.64] Okay.
[468.84 → 469.12] All right.
[469.16 → 469.40] All right.
[469.44 → 472.06] So I have no defence for the dongle argument.
[472.68 → 477.60] The one thing that I will say is I think there is plenty...
[477.60 → 477.78] Wait.
[478.16 → 478.96] Is it down?
[479.44 → 480.68] That chat is moving fast.
[481.98 → 484.50] Is the YouTube stream actually down?
[484.92 → 485.92] What about Float plane?
[487.22 → 488.88] You have got to be kidding me.
[490.64 → 492.48] Um...
[492.48 → 494.02] No, we're still up on Float plane.
[494.14 → 494.84] Of course we are.
[494.94 → 496.20] And we're still up on Twitch.
[496.80 → 498.52] So, um, yeah.
[499.82 → 501.86] There's nothing I can do.
[502.94 → 503.52] I am...
[503.52 → 504.52] We are completely...
[504.52 → 506.38] We're completely helpless.
[507.24 → 507.92] Sorry, guys.
[508.02 → 509.44] Nothing I can do.
[510.08 → 512.52] Uh, Twitch and...
[512.52 → 514.68] Float plane working fine.
[515.82 → 517.20] This is hilarious.
[518.14 → 519.30] Why is there nothing we can do?
[519.36 → 520.06] I don't really get it.
[520.06 → 520.38] What is...
[520.38 → 520.90] Or how do you know that?
[520.96 → 521.96] What is set reminder?
[522.12 → 523.68] There's just nothing here.
[525.14 → 526.18] Excellent connection.
[526.18 → 527.18] Excellent condition.
[527.60 → 528.52] Or excellent connection.
[529.26 → 530.28] It's set to public.
[530.88 → 531.52] There's nothing...
[532.24 → 532.44] Wait.
[532.48 → 534.40] Why is it set to 5.20 p.m.?
[534.40 → 535.68] What is this?
[536.22 → 538.00] What the hell is this?
[539.90 → 541.68] How about set it to nothing?
[541.82 → 542.06] How about...
[542.06 → 543.12] It's a live stream.
[543.14 → 544.38] How about go live?
[544.48 → 545.52] What even...
[545.52 → 547.48] Oh my god.
[548.86 → 549.90] So, wait.
[549.98 → 551.34] Is it going to come back now?
[551.90 → 552.24] Ha!
[552.42 → 554.70] This is so stupid.
[555.64 → 556.44] And what...
[556.44 → 558.26] Why is it still set to 5.20?
[558.64 → 559.48] I just...
[559.48 → 560.90] I just changed it.
[560.90 → 562.36] Waiting for Linus Tech Tips.
[562.64 → 564.20] December 6th, 5.20 p.m.
[564.56 → 564.84] What?
[564.90 → 565.64] You cannot set it...
[565.64 → 566.78] Oh, you can't go back in time.
[566.78 → 569.34] You cannot set it to go with the past.
[569.60 → 571.94] You cannot set it to just go live.
[572.34 → 573.14] What about this?
[573.52 → 574.32] Go live button.
[575.10 → 576.74] This is the worst...
[576.74 → 577.42] We're live!
[577.74 → 581.08] This is the worst interface I have ever seen.
[581.42 → 582.04] Oh, boy.
[582.08 → 582.88] Oh, wow.
[583.06 → 586.30] So, one of YouTube's engineers who work on this
[586.30 → 590.02] was actually supposed to come onto the stream today
[590.02 → 590.78] and...
[591.40 → 593.36] Or, like, walk us through it ahead of time.
[594.28 → 595.12] And...
[595.12 → 595.40] Today.
[595.40 → 596.86] Today, yeah, but...
[596.86 → 597.40] That would have been good.
[597.50 → 600.26] He was like, oh, I have to go do something after 4.
[600.42 → 602.16] And I was like, okay, well, we don't start our stream
[602.16 → 603.34] until 4.30 or 5.
[604.68 → 605.08] And...
[605.08 → 606.96] He was like, okay, well, how about we do it next week?
[606.98 → 607.66] I was like, okay.
[608.14 → 609.02] This is like...
[609.02 → 610.24] This has been a clinic
[610.24 → 614.50] on why your interface is abominable.
[614.82 → 616.08] So, if I click edit,
[616.62 → 617.78] what's going to happen?
[619.30 → 619.94] Okay, wait.
[619.94 → 620.36] Where's the schedule?
[620.86 → 622.26] There's no schedule anymore.
[622.28 → 623.12] Where's the scheduling stuff?
[623.16 → 623.92] How did that come up?
[624.02 → 624.40] Where did...
[624.40 → 625.38] Where did the...
[625.38 → 626.54] scheduling thing come up?
[626.58 → 627.58] This is so amazing.
[627.98 → 629.54] So, when we clicked edit a second ago,
[629.68 → 630.56] there was a schedule.
[630.70 → 631.94] You can't set it to the past.
[632.08 → 632.76] You click live now.
[632.76 → 634.54] I don't even know what happened.
[634.68 → 635.22] Well, no.
[635.34 → 637.32] Probably because the schedule is only exposed
[637.32 → 638.42] when you end the stream.
[638.50 → 639.18] Yeah, I guess so.
[639.18 → 640.24] But I didn't end the stream.
[640.32 → 641.26] I didn't touch it.
[642.00 → 642.98] This is so amazing.
[643.24 → 644.68] Anyway, back to the phone.
[644.94 → 645.90] Back to the iPhone.
[645.90 → 647.88] I love you're sick yelling voice.
[647.88 → 649.06] Oh, I'm so mad.
[649.06 → 651.28] You sound like a 14-year-old girl going through puberty.
[651.34 → 653.42] I've had such a frustrating week.
[654.00 → 655.48] Every project I've worked on
[655.48 → 657.82] has just had so many unnecessary problems.
[658.26 → 659.68] You know, when you go into a project
[659.68 → 660.22] and it's like,
[660.28 → 663.12] okay, I know that, like,
[663.12 → 666.24] the virtualization on this motherboard
[666.24 → 668.52] is a potential sticking point.
[668.92 → 670.24] Or, like, you know,
[670.32 → 672.82] I know that getting this much RAM
[672.82 → 674.24] to be detected is a potential problem.
[674.56 → 676.38] And then you spend most of your time
[676.38 → 678.28] finding a USB that works.
[678.72 → 679.18] You know, like,
[679.24 → 682.26] where it's just these problems
[682.26 → 684.28] that shouldn't be problems,
[684.70 → 685.34] causing problems.
[685.62 → 687.18] I upgraded my TV.
[687.64 → 688.52] And so, obviously,
[688.66 → 689.76] this is a very first world problem,
[690.12 → 692.10] but it's an HDMI 2.1 TV.
[692.10 → 694.64] So, I guess there's some
[694.64 → 696.74] new HDCP handshaking issues.
[697.10 → 697.40] Okay.
[697.48 → 699.74] So, I plugged it in through my receiver
[699.74 → 701.74] and it worked for a matter of,
[702.18 → 703.70] I don't know, two minutes.
[703.96 → 705.84] And then I got this coloured snow.
[706.46 → 708.70] And once you get the coloured snow,
[708.98 → 710.66] the only way to fix it
[710.66 → 715.14] is to go get another ducking display
[715.14 → 717.28] and plug it in directly
[717.28 → 719.02] so that you can change the like,
[719.28 → 720.84] deep colour profile
[720.84 → 722.92] of your stupid Windows colour settings
[722.92 → 724.70] back and then plug it in
[724.70 → 725.26] through your receiver.
[725.38 → 725.70] And it's like,
[726.16 → 727.72] all this crawling around
[727.72 → 728.56] behind the TV
[728.56 → 731.00] just for something that,
[732.16 → 733.16] holy crap,
[733.38 → 735.08] HDCP doesn't work.
[735.50 → 737.12] Piracy is still a thing.
[737.12 → 739.80] Just piss off.
[740.44 → 741.80] Not to mention the fact that,
[741.86 → 742.96] like, three years ago,
[743.00 → 744.66] you hear about this spec being ratified
[744.66 → 746.56] and we've been waiting for this to roll out,
[746.60 → 747.98] like, since I've worked here.
[749.34 → 752.74] And then it makes me all upset
[752.74 → 755.26] and then I have the computer screen thing up
[755.26 → 757.24] instead of us being sitting here talking.
[757.88 → 760.32] I have just had so much of this week.
[760.42 → 761.40] I am so done.
[761.58 → 762.46] I can't wait for the weekend.
[762.60 → 763.60] And, of course, I'm sick.
[763.60 → 765.00] And I'm coming into it,
[765.04 → 766.22] not getting better right now,
[766.32 → 767.68] so I'm going to spend the weekend
[767.68 → 768.98] just sick.
[769.14 → 770.32] Well, you actually got sick
[770.32 → 771.98] because of these projects, though.
[772.08 → 773.98] I was up till three working.
[774.06 → 774.98] It's a cool project.
[775.12 → 776.34] You guys are going to love the video.
[776.90 → 780.20] Basically, I wired up fibre optics
[780.20 → 781.74] in my walls at home.
[782.02 → 783.18] I got some help from Colin,
[783.28 → 784.80] who's one of our newer writers here,
[785.30 → 787.70] and I made it so that my server room,
[788.24 → 789.82] with one PC even,
[789.98 → 791.70] although that's not the most practical way to do it,
[791.70 → 794.54] but my server room has fibre optic display port
[794.54 → 796.88] and USB running all over the house,
[797.00 → 798.32] so every computer in the house
[798.32 → 799.68] can be hidden away in one corner.
[800.20 → 800.88] It's sick.
[801.24 → 802.14] It's awesome.
[802.68 → 804.48] But I was up till three in the morning
[804.48 → 807.76] finding USB keys that worked.
[808.30 → 810.10] It was just very frustrating.
[810.56 → 813.10] Anyway, back to the iPhone.
[813.10 → 813.24] iPhone.
[813.24 → 817.16] The only defence I have
[817.16 → 819.10] is the wireless charging
[819.10 → 822.44] because I can see wireless charging
[822.44 → 823.34] over the next couple of years
[823.34 → 824.96] getting better enough
[824.96 → 827.58] that there's just no real need
[827.58 → 828.64] to plug in.
[829.32 → 829.76] And it's just,
[830.00 → 831.18] I mean, from an Apple perspective,
[831.46 → 832.56] it's a point of failure.
[833.00 → 835.00] It's an ingress point for dust.
[835.38 → 836.28] It's something for people
[836.28 → 838.98] to snap off cables in and break
[838.98 → 841.72] or short out in the event that,
[841.72 → 843.16] you know, let's, okay,
[843.52 → 846.00] here's a great point
[846.00 → 847.34] against having a lightning port.
[847.58 → 849.00] You can seal up the chassis
[849.00 → 849.98] as best you can
[849.98 → 852.20] and you can use, like,
[852.62 → 854.34] membranes and stuff like that
[854.34 → 855.90] to make a port, you know,
[856.02 → 856.82] reasonably waterproof,
[857.26 → 859.50] but only fresh water.
[859.92 → 862.44] If you could seal up the entire chassis,
[862.90 → 864.18] maybe you could make it
[864.18 → 865.66] impervious to salt water.
[866.12 → 867.24] That would be sick.
[867.36 → 868.64] An iPhone that you could take out
[868.64 → 869.14] on the boat?
[869.60 → 870.34] What about, um,
[870.34 → 871.56] that is awesome,
[871.64 → 872.52] but what about security?
[872.84 → 873.72] Like, a lot of security
[873.72 → 875.14] has to do with plugging in
[875.14 → 877.56] and, you know,
[877.60 → 878.00] those, like,
[878.08 → 878.76] I have your phone
[878.76 → 879.42] and I plug it in?
[879.52 → 879.84] Yeah.
[879.84 → 880.52] There's no point.
[880.96 → 882.32] No point, does that make it harder?
[882.58 → 884.24] This YubiKey is, like,
[884.48 → 886.34] three or four years old, though,
[886.42 → 888.18] and already has NFC,
[888.66 → 889.26] so, like,
[889.54 → 890.56] I don't see why
[890.56 → 891.66] we can't just expect
[891.66 → 892.54] the world to move on
[892.54 → 894.00] from plugging a dongle
[894.00 → 894.54] into your phone
[894.54 → 895.44] to authenticate something.
[895.44 → 898.16] What about CarPlay?
[899.86 → 900.38] Well, yeah,
[900.44 → 901.24] that would suck.
[902.46 → 903.90] I don't have a response to that.
[904.04 → 904.96] They're going to have to change some things.
[905.22 → 905.86] Although, even, like,
[905.90 → 906.44] Android Auto,
[906.54 → 907.30] what I have in my car,
[907.36 → 908.42] I have to plug my phone in,
[908.72 → 909.84] but I believe there are
[909.84 → 910.94] more expensive
[910.94 → 912.62] stereos or whatever
[912.62 → 913.44] that have
[913.44 → 915.02] wireless Android Auto.
[915.44 → 915.76] Really?
[915.84 → 917.30] I actually did not know that,
[917.38 → 918.14] to be honest with you.
[918.14 → 918.66] I think they're, like,
[918.72 → 919.36] a grand, though.
[920.86 → 921.60] But I don't know
[921.60 → 922.36] about the CarPlay world.
[922.36 → 924.32] They might be wireless sooner
[924.32 → 925.08] or more cheaply.
[925.42 → 926.30] Yeah, apparently there's
[926.30 → 927.50] a casting version of it.
[927.56 → 928.06] Okay, that's cool.
[928.12 → 928.78] Of CarPlay?
[929.02 → 929.18] Yeah.
[929.22 → 929.80] Because CarPlay is...
[929.80 → 930.66] Oh, no, Android Auto.
[931.16 → 932.12] I don't know about CarPlay.
[932.38 → 933.38] Well, CarPlay is available
[933.38 → 935.38] in more automobiles
[935.38 → 935.86] and cheaper
[935.86 → 937.18] than Android Auto is.
[938.06 → 939.42] Wireless CarPlay adapter
[939.42 → 940.80] from CarPlay to Air.
[941.44 → 942.48] No need to...
[942.48 → 943.18] Okay, so, yeah,
[943.26 → 943.70] you know what?
[944.82 → 945.96] You would need a...
[945.96 → 948.14] You'd need a wireless dongle.
[948.60 → 949.64] Exactly what I said.
[949.66 → 950.36] A wireless dongle.
[950.38 → 951.88] So, you would plug this dongle
[951.88 → 952.72] into the lightning
[952.72 → 954.68] or the USB port of your car.
[955.00 → 955.32] Oh.
[955.66 → 956.26] And then you'd have
[956.26 → 958.14] wireless USB, effectively,
[958.26 → 959.70] because it's only USB 2, even.
[960.08 → 960.94] Like, the data rates
[960.94 → 961.82] aren't even that high.
[961.98 → 963.04] Someone was watching the show
[963.04 → 963.50] and they're just like,
[963.56 → 964.58] okay, I'm going to go make
[964.58 → 967.82] a wireless cupholder-sized dongle
[967.82 → 968.84] that has a little wire
[968.84 → 969.96] that goes into your USB port.
[969.96 → 970.14] Yep.
[970.20 → 971.06] It just sits at the bottom
[971.06 → 971.64] of your cupholder
[971.64 → 972.58] and you chuck your phone in there.
[972.78 → 973.88] Well, that's what this is.
[974.68 → 976.04] Is it the shape of your cupholder?
[976.12 → 976.40] No.
[976.80 → 977.02] No.
[977.20 → 978.00] Ah, you're done goofed.
[978.06 → 979.04] But, yeah, there you go.
[979.04 → 981.74] So, you want to use your old wired,
[982.02 → 983.76] you know, caveman CarPlay?
[983.96 → 984.72] No problem.
[985.02 → 986.34] And I'm sure Apple would be happy
[986.34 → 988.36] to sell it for, I think,
[988.44 → 991.02] $149 is probably what I would expect
[991.02 → 991.86] for something like that.
[992.54 → 992.84] Oh.
[993.20 → 993.44] Yeah.
[993.70 → 994.58] Ah, that's a lot.
[994.72 → 995.94] That is a lot for that.
[996.20 → 996.98] Yeah, but you're a pro.
[996.98 → 999.30] So, like, you have money, right?
[1000.10 → 1001.22] You're using your iPhone,
[1001.22 → 1002.96] you're using your iPhone Pro
[1002.96 → 1004.46] to shoot short films
[1004.46 → 1007.16] and showing them at film festivals
[1007.16 → 1009.82] where surely you get paid for that
[1009.82 → 1011.10] and...
[1011.10 → 1012.58] Wait, what are we talking about?
[1012.72 → 1013.40] Pros, pros.
[1013.50 → 1013.88] Yeah, pros.
[1014.64 → 1015.08] What's up, pros?
[1015.76 → 1016.34] What's up, pros?
[1017.96 → 1019.18] My laptop is dying
[1019.18 → 1020.40] and I'm going to see if I can
[1020.40 → 1021.50] pull a fast one
[1021.50 → 1022.76] and have someone bring me.
[1022.86 → 1023.24] Here you go.
[1024.06 → 1025.26] That's not gonna work for me.
[1025.68 → 1026.08] Oh, wait.
[1026.28 → 1026.98] Ah, you're on your gram.
[1027.78 → 1028.34] All right, then.
[1028.50 → 1028.64] Yeah.
[1028.98 → 1029.48] Never mind.
[1029.66 → 1031.34] Wait, doesn't that gram have type C?
[1031.74 → 1032.08] Yeah.
[1032.18 → 1033.66] I thought it charges over type C as well.
[1034.44 → 1035.00] I'm pretty sure.
[1035.18 → 1036.66] Man, this will be pretty cool.
[1036.78 → 1037.50] Yeah, if it breaks,
[1037.58 → 1038.96] it'll be my laptop anyway,
[1039.14 → 1041.20] so I guess you have nothing to lose.
[1044.02 → 1044.34] Gone.
[1044.48 → 1046.72] Your battery is running low thing went away.
[1047.00 → 1047.94] All right, we got this.
[1048.24 → 1048.82] Hell yeah.
[1049.04 → 1050.72] Of course I can't bring up the document
[1050.72 → 1052.06] to talk about one of our other topics
[1052.06 → 1053.64] because it's just not working right now.
[1054.58 → 1055.58] Oh, you know what?
[1055.62 → 1056.62] We should announce these charities.
[1056.88 → 1058.40] Yeah, so our friends
[1058.40 → 1059.58] Paul from Paul's Hardware
[1059.58 → 1061.34] and Kyle from Nitwit
[1061.34 → 1065.32] are hosting a 12-hour charity stream tomorrow
[1065.32 → 1066.52] that you should all go check out.
[1066.82 → 1068.48] They're raising money for Extra Life,
[1068.80 → 1070.26] so it's Sunday, December 7th
[1070.26 → 1071.76] from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Pacific,
[1072.22 → 1073.98] twitch.tv slash awesome hardware,
[1074.32 → 1075.58] YouTube.com slash nitwit,
[1075.84 → 1077.38] YouTube.com slash Paul's Hardware.
[1077.46 → 1078.46] So go check that out, guys.
[1078.46 → 1080.62] And if you want something a little more immediate,
[1081.18 → 1083.90] Luke is actually working on something with Microsoft.
[1084.04 → 1085.62] Mixer.com slash Extra Life.
[1086.12 → 1087.20] You guys can check that out.
[1087.22 → 1089.08] I believe that is today.
[1090.48 → 1091.50] Mixer, hey, Luke.
[1092.06 → 1092.34] Hmm.
[1092.96 → 1093.92] All right, you know what?
[1093.96 → 1096.50] I'm going to let you do this Qualcomm next-gen VR thing
[1096.50 → 1098.54] while I go finish up shooting with Andy and Alex.
[1098.60 → 1100.26] No, you're the one who loves VR.
[1100.42 → 1102.18] This is for, I put this in for you.
[1102.24 → 1104.04] Yeah, but I don't care about, like, mobile VR.
[1104.24 → 1104.96] Okay, Quest.
[1104.98 → 1105.30] What do you do?
[1105.30 → 1106.02] Quest is pretty cool.
[1106.02 → 1107.90] All right, fine, you can find something else you want to do.
[1108.30 → 1109.64] You want to talk through the Haswell?
[1109.70 → 1110.22] Oh, TikTok?
[1111.40 → 1112.74] Oh, wow, that's terrible.
[1114.32 → 1115.28] All right, go ahead.
[1115.30 → 1117.24] These are all meant to be for us to discuss.
[1117.46 → 1118.06] Yeah, VRB.
[1118.08 → 1118.76] Fine, okay.
[1119.66 → 1120.54] TikTok, guys.
[1120.88 → 1122.48] Are you younger than me?
[1122.70 → 1123.90] Then you may use TikTok.
[1124.48 → 1125.84] TikTok used to be called Musical.ly,
[1126.00 → 1127.20] and my little sister used it.
[1127.32 → 1130.38] And I thought it was a disgusting waste of an app
[1130.38 → 1131.96] that was obviously a rip-off of Instagram,
[1132.14 → 1133.50] but just made more kid-like.
[1133.50 → 1135.32] Turns out I'm wrong,
[1135.44 → 1138.36] and it gets bought by Tencent and turned into TikTok,
[1138.60 → 1139.76] and it's now a phenomenon.
[1140.52 → 1142.14] But it's not without its controversy.
[1142.36 → 1145.50] So what happened was social video network TikTok
[1145.50 → 1149.64] apparently limited the reach of users with disabilities,
[1150.14 → 1152.70] including facial disfigurement and Down syndrome.
[1152.84 → 1155.42] Well, it's actually a little more broad than that.
[1155.58 → 1159.24] I guess what happened was I feel for them.
[1159.30 → 1160.06] They had good intentions.
[1160.06 → 1163.24] They wanted all their users to have a good experience on their platform.
[1163.78 → 1166.58] So what they did was they had their moderators go through
[1166.58 → 1168.54] and look at users' profile pages
[1168.54 → 1174.86] and kind of evaluate whether a user might be the type of person
[1174.86 → 1177.72] who would attract negative cyberbullying.
[1178.10 → 1181.02] And they wanted to protect those users from being bullied
[1181.02 → 1182.74] and having a bad experience on the platform.
[1182.74 → 1188.48] So what they did was they, in a sense, punished those would-be victims
[1188.48 → 1191.92] by just limiting the reach of their content.
[1192.14 → 1195.70] So if I posted something, it just wouldn't get shared as far.
[1195.78 → 1198.50] They just kind of nerfed them algorithmically.
[1198.50 → 1202.12] So the people who got flagged by this,
[1203.20 → 1206.08] and again, this is just subjective from the moderators of TikTok,
[1206.28 → 1209.38] but it was people who maybe looked a certain way
[1209.38 → 1211.60] or were members of the LGBT community
[1211.60 → 1214.20] or were part of a fat acceptance movement.
[1214.42 → 1219.88] There's a kind of like curves positive creator on there
[1219.88 → 1221.12] who was affected by this.
[1221.56 → 1225.90] Also people with special needs or differently abled people
[1225.90 → 1226.84] were affected by this.
[1226.84 → 1229.20] And so once they're put on this list,
[1230.02 → 1232.96] their videos would only appear in the country where they were uploaded.
[1233.08 → 1235.20] So they're geographically restricted then.
[1235.24 → 1236.36] It's not getting sent as far.
[1236.76 → 1241.30] Or they're just omitted from the For You feed
[1241.30 → 1244.34] after they hit a certain view count.
[1245.46 → 1250.46] So kind of brutal if you're...
[1250.46 → 1251.46] I don't know.
[1251.92 → 1254.62] It's fascinating because on the one hand,
[1254.66 → 1256.30] I can see why they want everyone to have a good experience
[1256.30 → 1257.58] because they want everyone to be happy on there.
[1257.64 → 1259.20] But maybe the experience you're looking for
[1259.20 → 1261.38] is having a megaphone and telling your story
[1261.38 → 1263.34] to as many people as you can.
[1263.68 → 1265.78] And some of the people that they flagged
[1265.78 → 1267.56] have like hundreds of thousands of followers.
[1269.10 → 1272.20] So it's a bad experience if you're not getting bigger
[1272.20 → 1273.86] and getting the engagement that you want.
[1273.94 → 1275.32] That's the experience you're after.
[1275.32 → 1276.80] So if they crippled that experience,
[1276.80 → 1277.78] then they're failing.
[1279.10 → 1280.46] A spokesperson from TikTok said
[1280.46 → 1283.14] the rules were never intended to be a long-term solution.
[1283.28 → 1284.90] I think it's something they kind of hacked together
[1284.90 → 1288.34] instead of having proper policies that they would normally have.
[1288.86 → 1290.80] Like something like Twitter or Instagram might have.
[1290.80 → 1296.70] But the moderators were instructed to follow these instructions
[1296.70 → 1298.24] as recently as September.
[1299.76 → 1303.58] TikTok itself has previously faced charges of political censorship,
[1303.80 → 1306.48] including limiting videos that would offend the Chinese government
[1306.48 → 1308.28] because, of course, they are owned by Tencent.
[1309.00 → 1313.16] And most very large companies in China
[1313.16 → 1316.40] are pretty tightly-knit with the Communist Party.
[1316.40 → 1317.60] So that makes sense.
[1319.18 → 1320.78] TikTok recently suspended a user
[1320.78 → 1323.94] who criticized China's mass imprisonment of the Uyghur Muslims,
[1324.08 → 1325.80] although a spokesperson said that the suspension
[1325.80 → 1327.58] was actually related to a different video
[1327.58 → 1328.86] and the ban was later reversed.
[1329.00 → 1330.64] And I don't know much about that story.
[1331.16 → 1332.12] Just putting that in there.
[1334.92 → 1338.02] The question, though, of user experience versus user freedom.
[1338.44 → 1339.44] That's a huge one.
[1339.48 → 1341.36] And I wonder if there's a cultural difference here
[1341.36 → 1345.04] where this never happened exactly like this
[1345.04 → 1347.12] on an American platform like Facebook
[1347.12 → 1349.06] or Facebook property like Instagram
[1349.06 → 1350.46] and never happened on Twitter,
[1350.94 → 1355.46] maybe because our culture just prioritizes freedom,
[1356.18 → 1359.80] whereas this is happening on a Chinese platform
[1359.80 → 1362.22] because they just have different values.
[1364.44 → 1364.84] I don't know.
[1365.26 → 1367.36] I wish Linus was here to talk to me about it,
[1367.72 → 1368.18] but he's not.
[1368.88 → 1371.26] Guys, Craigslist finally has an app.
[1371.26 → 1373.28] I don't know about you guys,
[1373.36 → 1375.98] but I have recently stopped using Craigslist altogether
[1375.98 → 1377.84] because Facebook Marketplace is way better.
[1378.28 → 1379.00] And if Linus were here,
[1379.16 → 1381.10] he would tell you that he likes to use the app Lego,
[1381.56 → 1384.70] which personally I think is just like Facebook Marketplace,
[1384.82 → 1386.36] but probably has fewer people on it.
[1386.64 → 1387.76] But now, guess what?
[1388.44 → 1389.66] Craigslist is coming back.
[1389.88 → 1390.62] They're catching up.
[1390.82 → 1391.50] They made an app.
[1391.64 → 1392.48] It's available on iOS,
[1392.72 → 1393.92] and there's a beta on Android,
[1394.06 → 1396.12] which I downloaded on my new Pixel 4 phone
[1396.12 → 1396.82] that arrived today.
[1398.78 → 1399.64] It's hilarious.
[1399.64 → 1401.34] You log into this thing,
[1401.46 → 1403.78] and it just has the exact same feel
[1403.78 → 1406.30] as the website you're used to.
[1406.64 → 1407.14] Look at this.
[1407.36 → 1408.46] You probably can't see this.
[1408.58 → 1410.16] There's like three words on the top.
[1410.40 → 1411.56] They're in the default text.
[1411.64 → 1414.46] You don't even need CSS to make sheets like this.
[1414.50 → 1416.62] It says Craigslist is local classifieds.
[1416.84 → 1418.58] Sharing your location is recommended.
[1418.96 → 1420.62] This is just the onboarding flow.
[1421.20 → 1422.82] I'm going to share it.
[1423.58 → 1424.52] I'm going to share it.
[1424.58 → 1426.52] I want to see this Craigslist app in action
[1426.52 → 1430.54] because I heard that it looks as plain as it always has,
[1430.66 → 1432.56] which is actually probably what you want
[1432.56 → 1435.60] if you're a Craigslist aficionado.
[1437.38 → 1438.52] One thing they did do,
[1438.62 → 1440.58] which was better on the web at least,
[1440.90 → 1443.08] was they did switch to embedding the pictures
[1443.08 → 1446.00] right onto the I guess, feed
[1446.00 → 1448.20] or the listings page, search results page,
[1448.50 → 1450.04] because that was one of the biggest things
[1450.04 → 1452.26] that Facebook Marketplace is way, way, way better at.
[1452.54 → 1455.14] The listings aren't headlines that you have to read.
[1455.14 → 1457.14] The listings are just photos.
[1457.30 → 1459.52] It's such a much more media-rich page,
[1459.90 → 1462.82] and you can just take in so much more information
[1462.82 → 1464.72] faster when it's images rather than text
[1464.72 → 1467.08] that you can just scroll through all the stuff
[1467.08 → 1469.94] that you don't need to buy so much more efficiently.
[1470.76 → 1472.42] I think Craigslist's been doing that for a while now too,
[1472.94 → 1475.52] but it still doesn't have things like instant messaging,
[1475.70 → 1477.36] which is wicked on Facebook Marketplace
[1477.36 → 1479.48] because who wants to email somebody
[1479.48 → 1480.94] and then wait like five hours for them
[1480.94 → 1482.02] to check their email and reply?
[1482.02 → 1485.08] A Facebook Marketplace, I can just message the person,
[1485.18 → 1487.20] which makes it way more intimate and casual.
[1487.34 → 1489.84] I can just be like, hey, I want your thing.
[1489.92 → 1490.60] Is it still here?
[1492.58 → 1495.48] And you can click through to their Facebook profile
[1495.48 → 1496.72] and see how old their profile is,
[1496.84 → 1498.26] if they're like a real person and everything.
[1499.04 → 1500.90] Way more safe feeling.
[1501.08 → 1502.80] Thank God, Linus is back.
[1502.96 → 1503.70] Ninja roll.
[1503.82 → 1504.80] Oh, why are you doing this?
[1504.80 → 1505.52] Why?
[1507.02 → 1507.86] That's not really a...
[1507.86 → 1508.18] Oh!
[1509.96 → 1510.68] Right in the chair.
[1510.70 → 1512.10] That's the most success you've had all week.
[1512.62 → 1513.38] Yeah, pretty much.
[1513.94 → 1514.90] I was just talking about...
[1514.90 → 1516.56] I was talking about the new Craigslist app.
[1516.98 → 1517.82] There's an app now.
[1517.94 → 1518.18] What?
[1518.26 → 1518.56] No way.
[1518.58 → 1519.54] Craigslist made an app, dude.
[1519.60 → 1520.06] Check it out.
[1520.90 → 1522.12] That seems...
[1522.12 → 1525.06] Like, why don't they make their website better first?
[1525.22 → 1526.28] That's the whole thing is,
[1526.48 → 1528.06] it looks like crap, and you love it.
[1528.54 → 1530.66] And look, the website, the app looks just as crappy.
[1531.04 → 1531.20] What?
[1531.28 → 1531.58] Why?
[1532.06 → 1533.32] Why would they...
[1533.32 → 1533.80] Why?
[1534.24 → 1535.90] Doesn't Craigslist actually have, like,
[1535.90 → 1537.72] a significant number of people working there?
[1538.16 → 1539.84] I don't know how many people worked there,
[1539.94 → 1541.30] but this is what it looks like.
[1541.68 → 1542.06] Okay.
[1542.06 → 1547.02] I guess they don't want to be completely irrelevant.
[1547.20 → 1548.38] It's like they're, like...
[1548.38 → 1549.40] They're just laggards.
[1549.46 → 1550.10] Like your grandpa.
[1550.24 → 1550.50] They're like,
[1550.56 → 1552.44] until they really have to.
[1552.52 → 1552.88] Fine!
[1553.92 → 1556.20] I was reading an interview with, like,
[1556.22 → 1557.36] the founder of Craigslist.
[1557.50 → 1558.02] Is his name Craig?
[1558.36 → 1559.36] I believe so, yeah.
[1559.36 → 1559.60] Thank God.
[1561.12 → 1563.20] And he was basically...
[1563.20 → 1564.56] As far as I could tell,
[1565.10 → 1566.78] he hasn't pushed Craigslist forward
[1566.78 → 1569.64] because he just actually doesn't care at all.
[1569.64 → 1572.78] He seems to be one of those people
[1572.78 → 1574.96] because Craigslist had an opportunity
[1574.96 → 1577.28] to be, you know, huge.
[1577.74 → 1578.04] Sure.
[1578.28 → 1580.48] Yeah, like, go secure multiple rounds
[1580.48 → 1582.00] of gigantic amounts of funding
[1582.00 → 1583.76] and, like, try to be, like,
[1584.10 → 1586.00] you know, Craig's social network or whatever.
[1586.10 → 1588.08] Like, they have enough traffic to the site
[1588.08 → 1591.46] that they could kind of pivot or branch out.
[1591.72 → 1593.28] There was definitely potential there.
[1593.64 → 1595.34] But the vibe that I got from this interview
[1595.34 → 1596.52] was that just, like,
[1597.10 → 1598.50] he was at the point where he, like,
[1598.50 → 1600.06] had it made and, like,
[1600.88 → 1602.64] you know, that seems good enough.
[1603.30 → 1603.96] Like, remember,
[1604.04 → 1604.94] they didn't even get, like,
[1605.00 → 1606.66] a decent image uploader.
[1606.78 → 1608.66] And I mean, calling it decent is generous.
[1609.02 → 1609.72] Until, like...
[1609.72 → 1610.90] Everything just works.
[1610.98 → 1611.26] Yeah.
[1611.56 → 1613.08] Like, just barely.
[1615.80 → 1617.38] So, yeah, that's the vibe I get.
[1617.46 → 1618.48] I'm honestly surprised
[1618.48 → 1619.56] that they even did an app.
[1620.72 → 1621.52] It's probably, like,
[1621.52 → 1622.46] his son works there
[1622.46 → 1622.82] and is like,
[1622.90 → 1623.60] Dad, come on.
[1623.82 → 1625.56] I need a job for life, too.
[1625.56 → 1627.94] Like, they didn't even have...
[1627.94 → 1628.98] They don't even have the market share
[1628.98 → 1629.76] that you might expect.
[1630.18 → 1632.26] Like, you go as little distance
[1632.26 → 1634.00] as the next province over here to Alberta
[1634.00 → 1635.18] and no one uses it.
[1635.22 → 1635.98] They all use Ujiji.
[1636.36 → 1637.22] If you go to Australia,
[1637.38 → 1638.14] they all use Gumtree.
[1639.12 → 1640.94] They were, like, the first with just...
[1641.46 → 1643.12] Well, you can tell when they made this.
[1643.30 → 1643.46] Yeah.
[1643.46 → 1644.92] In, like, 99 or something.
[1645.08 → 1645.76] And it worked
[1645.76 → 1647.30] and then they just left it.
[1647.38 → 1647.54] Yeah.
[1647.88 → 1649.02] Whereas they could have advertised
[1649.02 → 1650.24] and just, like, swallowed the world.
[1650.40 → 1650.66] Yep.
[1650.66 → 1651.44] And there's, like,
[1651.48 → 1652.58] there are so many features
[1652.58 → 1653.98] that have even existed
[1653.98 → 1655.78] since way back then.
[1655.80 → 1656.74] I mean, do you remember Heatwave?
[1657.22 → 1657.50] No.
[1657.78 → 1658.02] Okay.
[1658.08 → 1660.86] So, Heatwave was a third-party service
[1660.86 → 1664.56] that was, like, a credibility measure.
[1664.92 → 1665.48] Oh, okay.
[1665.62 → 1668.04] So, you would always link your...
[1668.04 → 1669.16] So, I used to use sites
[1669.16 → 1670.86] like Craigslist a lot,
[1671.18 → 1672.58] but also Red Flag Deals
[1672.58 → 1673.74] was super active
[1673.74 → 1676.54] for Canadian computer parts reselling
[1676.54 → 1677.96] and buying used
[1677.96 → 1678.90] and all that kind of stuff.
[1678.90 → 1681.38] And so, you would always link
[1681.38 → 1682.84] your Heatwave in your profile,
[1682.94 → 1684.42] like, in your signature on forums.
[1684.68 → 1686.68] That way, you could have
[1686.68 → 1689.14] a consistent online identity
[1689.14 → 1690.74] across multiple platforms
[1690.74 → 1692.34] because at the time,
[1692.42 → 1693.60] eBay already existed,
[1693.92 → 1696.42] but there was no way to verify,
[1696.60 → 1697.96] for a third party to verify
[1697.96 → 1699.58] that this username
[1699.58 → 1702.02] that you had on extremesystems.org
[1702.02 → 1704.00] and this username on eBay
[1704.00 → 1706.08] were actually the same person.
[1706.08 → 1706.28] Right.
[1706.30 → 1707.04] Because otherwise, you'd be like,
[1707.10 → 1708.48] that guy on eBay has a great rating.
[1708.48 → 1709.58] I'm just going to use his username
[1709.58 → 1710.22] on this thing.
[1710.40 → 1710.54] Yeah.
[1710.74 → 1711.86] So, Heatwave,
[1712.06 → 1713.02] you could go to someone's
[1713.02 → 1713.70] Heatwave profile
[1713.70 → 1716.18] and they would have verified links
[1716.18 → 1717.64] to their accounts
[1717.64 → 1718.76] on all these sites
[1718.76 → 1719.78] all over the place.
[1720.18 → 1721.62] I mean, that concept existed
[1721.62 → 1722.92] when I was in high school.
[1723.56 → 1724.50] Craigslist could have
[1724.50 → 1725.80] integrated that.
[1725.86 → 1726.58] Like, they could have done
[1726.58 → 1728.52] almost anything
[1728.52 → 1729.54] and it would have been
[1729.54 → 1730.86] more than nothing.
[1732.56 → 1733.72] Oh, my God.
[1734.62 → 1735.56] Well, Craigslist,
[1735.64 → 1736.42] you're still alive.
[1736.42 → 1738.46] And the whole
[1738.46 → 1738.96] misconnection.
[1739.04 → 1739.48] Have you ever used
[1739.48 → 1740.22] a misconnection?
[1742.00 → 1743.16] My friend actually...
[1743.16 → 1743.34] No.
[1743.50 → 1744.16] You know what that is?
[1744.40 → 1745.40] I know what it is
[1745.40 → 1745.80] because I thought
[1745.80 → 1746.64] it was a Reddit thing.
[1746.88 → 1747.82] My friend locked eyes
[1747.82 → 1748.40] with some girl
[1748.40 → 1749.44] in a coffee shop.
[1749.56 → 1750.10] He went home.
[1750.22 → 1750.60] He was talking
[1750.60 → 1751.40] to his other friend about it
[1751.40 → 1752.58] and Buddy was like,
[1752.76 → 1753.32] you should check out
[1753.32 → 1753.82] misconnections.
[1753.88 → 1754.32] You should make
[1754.32 → 1755.36] misconnections on Craigslist.
[1755.44 → 1755.84] Go on there
[1755.84 → 1756.28] and you say,
[1756.38 → 1757.60] I saw you at the coffee shop
[1757.60 → 1758.14] and you were wearing
[1758.14 → 1758.68] a red sweater
[1758.68 → 1760.18] and we had a little moment
[1760.18 → 1761.64] and he goes on there
[1761.64 → 1762.94] and she had already made one.
[1763.20 → 1763.50] No.
[1763.50 → 1764.26] And then they dated
[1764.26 → 1764.98] for like a month
[1764.98 → 1766.58] and then it didn't work out.
[1767.46 → 1767.80] Huh.
[1767.86 → 1768.82] And now the story
[1768.82 → 1769.34] is being told
[1769.34 → 1770.46] to thousands of people.
[1771.60 → 1772.00] Wow.
[1772.44 → 1774.02] Megan, if you're out there...
[1774.02 → 1774.92] Just joking.
[1775.22 → 1776.14] Megan, if you're out there.
[1776.92 → 1778.02] Wow, that's crazy.
[1778.48 → 1779.40] No, but they had to
[1779.40 → 1780.20] get rid of a lot
[1780.20 → 1781.86] of their classifieds
[1781.86 → 1783.32] when VESTA got ratified
[1783.32 → 1784.02] in the law, right?
[1784.02 → 1784.12] Yeah, I saw that.
[1784.12 → 1785.10] They don't have like
[1785.10 → 1787.56] the M for W section anymore.
[1787.90 → 1788.06] Yeah.
[1788.18 → 1788.76] Which used to be
[1788.76 → 1789.48] the most fun
[1789.48 → 1790.42] when you're an immature man.
[1790.92 → 1791.36] Oh, really?
[1791.36 → 1792.36] You never went on there
[1792.36 → 1792.80] with your friends
[1792.80 → 1794.70] and posted a picture
[1794.70 → 1795.08] of your butthole
[1795.08 → 1795.36] or something?
[1795.98 → 1796.36] No.
[1796.54 → 1797.28] Why would I do that?
[1797.32 → 1797.98] Yeah, that's stupid.
[1799.02 → 1800.16] You want to talk about
[1800.16 → 1801.88] something more tech related?
[1805.60 → 1806.72] No, not yet.
[1807.16 → 1807.40] Oh.
[1807.72 → 1809.24] What I'd actually like to do
[1809.24 → 1810.12] is got through
[1810.12 → 1811.14] our sponsor spots
[1811.14 → 1813.06] so that I don't have them
[1813.06 → 1813.78] hanging over me
[1813.78 → 1814.96] for the rest of this stream.
[1814.96 → 1818.66] And then as soon as I am
[1818.66 → 1819.94] too tired and too sick
[1819.94 → 1820.62] to keep going,
[1820.74 → 1821.52] I can just leave.
[1823.56 → 1824.42] Ridge wallet.
[1826.10 → 1827.52] I'm sick and tired of this.
[1827.82 → 1828.54] Too much honesty.
[1828.82 → 1829.88] Too much honesty today.
[1830.30 → 1831.46] A Ridge wallet helps you
[1831.46 → 1832.46] stop carrying around
[1832.46 → 1833.16] pointless things
[1833.16 → 1833.72] in your pocket
[1833.72 → 1834.44] like receipts,
[1834.80 → 1836.00] old hotel room keys,
[1836.28 → 1837.40] and spent gift cards.
[1837.76 → 1838.00] Ugh.
[1838.34 → 1839.18] Ridge wallet helps you
[1839.18 → 1840.36] carry less while also
[1840.36 → 1842.26] reducing your wallet bulge
[1842.26 → 1844.02] because some types of bulge
[1844.02 → 1844.90] are not good.
[1845.22 → 1846.16] They use two metal plates
[1846.16 → 1846.92] that are bound by
[1846.92 → 1848.08] a strong elastic
[1848.08 → 1849.00] to hold your cards,
[1849.08 → 1850.24] keeping them tightly together
[1850.24 → 1851.10] but still accessible.
[1851.54 → 1852.44] They're RFID blocking.
[1852.58 → 1853.42] They have a lifetime guarantee.
[1853.74 → 1854.32] And they're available
[1854.32 → 1854.80] in aluminum,
[1855.04 → 1855.56] carbon fibre,
[1855.70 → 1856.24] and titanium.
[1856.84 → 1858.14] They even have printed patterns
[1858.14 → 1859.66] like tropical and tiki.
[1860.30 → 1861.56] And they don't just sell wallets.
[1861.86 → 1862.66] Use offer code Linus
[1862.66 → 1864.34] to save 10% on everything
[1864.34 → 1864.96] at Ridge wallet,
[1865.18 → 1865.70] or excuse me,
[1866.16 → 1867.96] ridge.com slash Linus.
[1868.04 → 1869.66] They've got wireless power banks,
[1869.98 → 1870.52] phone cases,
[1871.24 → 1871.60] bags,
[1871.84 → 1872.18] and more.
[1872.50 → 1873.16] That's pretty sweet.
[1874.34 → 1875.46] Sea sonic also sponsored
[1875.46 → 1876.18] the show today.
[1876.48 → 1877.08] You know what?
[1877.28 → 1878.86] Happy holidays from Sea sonic.
[1879.66 → 1880.34] They love you.
[1881.00 → 1882.08] Sea sonic legitimately
[1882.08 → 1883.64] paid for a sponsor spot
[1883.64 → 1884.44] in one of our videos
[1884.44 → 1885.32] that's just like,
[1885.74 → 1885.98] sup,
[1886.26 → 1887.46] happy holidays from Sea sonic.
[1887.60 → 1888.62] That's the only talking point?
[1888.64 → 1889.58] No product information.
[1889.58 → 1890.70] That's the only talking point.
[1890.70 → 1891.18] That was it.
[1891.28 → 1891.98] Yeah, it was pretty funny.
[1892.60 → 1893.44] Happy holidays from Sea sonic.
[1893.44 → 1894.00] I was like, really?
[1894.24 → 1895.30] I think there are actual,
[1895.30 → 1896.26] I think there are actual
[1896.26 → 1897.52] talking points for this one though.
[1898.22 → 1900.20] So Sea sonic makes
[1900.20 → 1901.42] great power supplies
[1901.42 → 1902.42] with efficiency levels
[1902.42 → 1903.80] up to 80 plus titanium
[1903.80 → 1906.02] with fluid dynamic fan bearings.
[1906.28 → 1907.46] So what's this one?
[1907.58 → 1907.88] Oh yeah,
[1907.94 → 1908.88] I think this is their
[1908.88 → 1911.46] Prime Ultra Titanium Series.
[1911.56 → 1913.42] These things have a 12-year warranty.
[1914.44 → 1915.34] Yes, continue.
[1915.46 → 1916.48] I don't care about cookies.
[1916.62 → 1916.76] Wow,
[1916.84 → 1918.48] that has been such a bane.
[1919.24 → 1920.36] That's not going anywhere.
[1920.36 → 1921.16] I know.
[1922.16 → 1923.10] Fully modular,
[1923.74 → 1924.86] super quiet,
[1925.20 → 1926.26] looks great.
[1926.62 → 1928.12] It's the kind of power supply
[1928.12 → 1929.32] that's going to,
[1929.32 → 1929.62] you know,
[1929.84 → 1931.52] last longer than your passion
[1931.52 → 1932.68] for computers, probably.
[1932.88 → 1933.94] I thought that was like a
[1933.94 → 1935.70] like a steampunk light bulb
[1935.70 → 1936.34] thing on there.
[1936.46 → 1936.86] No, no,
[1936.92 → 1937.98] it's just a zoom view
[1937.98 → 1938.96] of the capacitors
[1938.96 → 1939.40] they're using
[1939.40 → 1940.10] because if you're like
[1940.10 → 1940.86] a great big nerd,
[1940.98 → 1941.34] you're like,
[1941.58 → 1941.72] yeah,
[1941.78 → 1942.78] what modelling capacitors
[1942.78 → 1943.26] in there?
[1943.34 → 1943.80] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1943.82 → 1944.14] Wow.
[1944.40 → 1944.88] It's good stuff.
[1944.88 → 1946.46] So check them out
[1946.46 → 1949.22] at seasonic.com.
[1949.60 → 1950.30] Good stuff.
[1950.90 → 1951.34] All right,
[1951.44 → 1951.88] finally,
[1952.38 → 1952.86] Displate.
[1953.46 → 1954.06] Which plate?
[1954.40 → 1954.92] Displate.
[1955.82 → 1956.54] Thanks for that.
[1957.02 → 1957.94] Displate is a
[1957.94 → 1959.90] magnet mounted metal print.
[1960.06 → 1960.60] They're durable
[1960.60 → 1961.48] and you don't need
[1961.48 → 1962.38] any power tools
[1962.38 → 1962.94] to hang them.
[1963.28 → 1963.80] They've got over
[1963.80 → 1964.44] a quarter million
[1964.44 → 1965.20] different arts
[1965.20 → 1966.04] spanning a bunch
[1966.04 → 1966.72] of different styles
[1966.72 → 1967.28] and influences.
[1967.80 → 1968.82] Including influencers.
[1969.34 → 1970.82] They've got arts with us.
[1971.60 → 1972.00] Really?
[1972.22 → 1972.48] Yeah.
[1972.86 → 1973.10] Oh,
[1973.10 → 1974.20] I thought we killed
[1974.20 → 1974.78] that project.
[1975.32 → 1975.46] No,
[1975.48 → 1976.12] it's back baby.
[1976.62 → 1977.40] Displate.com.
[1977.40 → 1977.64] Really?
[1978.06 → 1978.32] No,
[1978.38 → 1978.84] I could be wrong
[1978.84 → 1979.44] but I'm pretty sure.
[1979.72 → 1979.88] Well,
[1979.94 → 1981.24] I know that some people
[1981.24 → 1982.08] wanted them.
[1983.64 → 1984.38] Like some people,
[1984.56 → 1985.16] so okay,
[1985.64 → 1985.98] okay,
[1986.08 → 1986.72] I'm going to explain
[1986.72 → 1987.28] what happened.
[1987.46 → 1988.78] So we were going to do
[1988.78 → 1990.10] displaces with,
[1990.54 → 1990.66] well,
[1990.70 → 1991.18] we were going to do
[1991.18 → 1992.40] some LTT displaces
[1992.40 → 1993.62] and then some people
[1993.62 → 1994.46] internally were like,
[1994.56 → 1994.68] yo,
[1994.74 → 1995.54] what the heck is this?
[1995.56 → 1996.38] Because there was like
[1996.38 → 1997.88] images of them
[1997.88 → 1998.96] for sale on a site
[1998.96 → 1999.44] and they were like,
[1999.44 → 1999.70] okay,
[1999.88 → 2000.22] I mean,
[2000.34 → 2000.86] like it's,
[2001.12 → 2001.90] I guess it's like
[2001.90 → 2002.64] maybe technically
[2002.64 → 2003.82] in my employment contract
[2003.82 → 2004.82] but also like,
[2004.88 → 2005.56] it would be nice
[2005.56 → 2006.38] if someone talked
[2006.38 → 2007.04] to me about this.
[2007.40 → 2008.26] I didn't know
[2008.26 → 2008.92] what had happened
[2008.92 → 2010.42] so I was like,
[2010.48 → 2010.58] yeah,
[2010.60 → 2011.06] we should probably
[2011.06 → 2011.74] deal with that.
[2012.00 → 2012.32] Anyway,
[2012.74 → 2013.68] some people were like,
[2013.74 → 2013.92] yeah,
[2013.96 → 2014.96] I'm not that into it
[2014.96 → 2016.68] and then it got killed
[2016.68 → 2017.28] for months
[2017.28 → 2019.08] and then Anthony
[2019.08 → 2019.66] of all people
[2019.66 → 2020.28] brought it up to me
[2020.28 → 2020.64] and was like,
[2021.32 → 2021.50] hey,
[2021.56 → 2022.20] what happened to the
[2022.20 → 2023.52] cool picture of me
[2023.52 → 2024.16] that was going to be
[2024.16 → 2024.58] on display
[2024.58 → 2024.98] and I was like,
[2024.98 → 2025.56] going to buy one.
[2025.56 → 2027.10] And I was like,
[2027.60 → 2028.56] we killed it,
[2028.64 → 2028.76] dude.
[2028.82 → 2029.24] And he's like,
[2029.30 → 2029.48] well,
[2029.64 → 2031.16] I really wanted one
[2031.16 → 2031.68] and I'm like,
[2032.20 → 2032.68] all right,
[2032.72 → 2033.68] we're resurrecting it.
[2033.88 → 2035.46] So now there's
[2035.46 → 2036.22] a bunch of displays.
[2036.52 → 2037.62] So here's me
[2037.62 → 2038.24] with the Lamb.
[2038.24 → 2038.90] That's perfect.
[2039.48 → 2039.92] Can we get,
[2040.12 → 2041.56] can we actually get
[2041.56 → 2042.34] our parking lot
[2042.34 → 2043.42] paved like that?
[2043.96 → 2044.48] No.
[2045.30 → 2046.28] Do you have any idea
[2046.28 → 2047.52] how much pavement costs?
[2047.94 → 2048.38] Pavement?
[2048.44 → 2049.44] I'm talking solar panels.
[2049.70 → 2052.20] We've got solar roadways.
[2052.20 → 2052.90] Oh,
[2052.96 → 2053.68] there's my dog.
[2053.70 → 2054.20] James.
[2054.82 → 2055.30] Nice.
[2055.96 → 2057.04] Yours is awesome.
[2057.62 → 2058.30] It looks like,
[2058.42 → 2059.76] it looks like,
[2059.98 → 2060.14] like,
[2060.28 → 2061.44] it reminds me of
[2061.44 → 2062.40] something in between
[2062.40 → 2063.30] Doctor Who
[2063.30 → 2064.24] and Doctor Strange,
[2064.40 → 2065.12] like the sophisticated,
[2065.30 → 2066.04] like the gentleman
[2066.04 → 2066.54] superhero.
[2066.54 → 2066.96] I think it looks jokily.
[2068.34 → 2068.58] Yeah,
[2068.62 → 2069.78] I could get an evil vibe too.
[2070.52 → 2071.52] We've got some of
[2071.52 → 2072.88] Brandon's great photography
[2072.88 → 2074.16] from our trip to Banff.
[2074.44 → 2074.60] No,
[2074.64 → 2074.78] wait,
[2074.88 → 2075.42] what is this?
[2075.66 → 2076.30] That's Mount Fuji.
[2076.34 → 2076.46] Oh,
[2076.46 → 2076.58] no,
[2076.66 → 2077.86] that's Brandon's great photography
[2077.86 → 2079.28] from somewhere else.
[2080.50 → 2081.76] It says Mount Fuji.
[2081.76 → 2084.18] He's in the back,
[2084.30 → 2084.66] Iceland,
[2084.94 → 2085.06] oh,
[2085.10 → 2085.50] Japan.
[2085.96 → 2086.78] Brandon just like
[2086.78 → 2087.50] travels the world
[2087.50 → 2088.62] and takes cool pictures.
[2088.96 → 2089.10] Hey,
[2089.12 → 2089.72] there's a Dennis one.
[2089.80 → 2089.98] Wait,
[2090.18 → 2091.64] Anthony's isn't even in here.
[2092.42 → 2093.08] Get him up.
[2093.36 → 2094.44] That's hilarious.
[2094.80 → 2095.00] Oh,
[2095.06 → 2095.30] man.
[2095.44 → 2096.08] And there's Dennis.
[2096.62 → 2097.04] And is that,
[2097.12 → 2098.60] is that Dennis' terrible car?
[2099.12 → 2100.00] What is this camera?
[2100.42 → 2101.02] It's just floating.
[2101.02 → 2101.88] What am I even looking at?
[2101.88 → 2103.04] I woke up like this.
[2103.44 → 2104.26] I believe you,
[2104.26 → 2104.46] Dennis.
[2104.96 → 2105.76] We all believe you,
[2105.84 → 2106.00] Dennis.
[2106.70 → 2107.50] So guys,
[2107.62 → 2108.52] head over to
[2108.52 → 2110.40] display.com
[2110.40 → 2111.10] slash something.
[2111.76 → 2112.20] Uh,
[2112.28 → 2112.60] head to,
[2112.68 → 2112.98] oh yeah,
[2113.06 → 2113.20] this,
[2113.30 → 2114.06] this link here.
[2114.26 → 2114.46] Well,
[2114.60 → 2115.36] wrong one.
[2115.88 → 2117.40] LEG.GT slash
[2117.40 → 2118.00] display.
[2118.12 → 2118.28] When,
[2118.66 → 2119.44] please work with us.
[2119.52 → 2119.94] Um,
[2120.22 → 2121.20] they plant 10 trees

[2122.38 → 2123.84] and you can save 15%
[2123.84 → 2124.46] of that link.
[2125.22 → 2125.94] All right.
[2125.94 → 2128.80] having too much fun on the WAN show today.
[2129.20 → 2131.36] I feel like I'm not in a great state of mind
[2131.36 → 2134.16] to tackle a sensitive topic like this,
[2134.26 → 2135.06] but what the
[2135.10 → 2135.20] hey,
[2135.26 → 2136.10] we're going into it.
[2136.16 → 2139.74] So this was originally posted by Rohit Kumar SP
[2139.74 → 2140.54] on the forum.
[2141.10 → 2141.52] Um,
[2141.52 → 2143.58] the original article here is,
[2143.74 → 2144.06] oh yeah,
[2144.10 → 2145.48] I guess it's like kind of that,
[2145.56 → 2146.68] but also it's from,
[2146.68 → 2147.34] uh,
[2147.42 → 2148.52] front page tech,
[2148.76 → 2149.04] uh,
[2149.04 → 2149.88] the YouTube channel.
[2149.88 → 2151.82] And there was another YouTuber that,
[2151.82 → 2152.48] uh,
[2152.48 → 2154.84] he collaborated with to kind of release
[2154.84 → 2156.50] concurrent videos about this.
[2156.78 → 2157.26] Uh,
[2157.32 → 2159.44] basically Lou from Unbox Therapy
[2159.44 → 2161.04] who I've known for a long time.
[2161.38 → 2161.56] Uh,
[2161.56 → 2163.16] we haven't actually talked recently,
[2163.32 → 2165.06] probably not in the last six months
[2165.06 → 2166.00] to a year or so,
[2166.10 → 2168.08] but he's making phone cases now.
[2168.50 → 2169.08] And he made,
[2169.22 → 2169.42] well,
[2169.54 → 2172.44] a case called the later case.
[2172.44 → 2174.20] So Lou kind of changed his,
[2174.20 → 2174.58] um,
[2175.18 → 2177.22] his handle a little while back
[2177.22 → 2177.88] when he launched,
[2177.96 → 2178.28] uh,
[2178.28 → 2178.88] his podcast.
[2178.88 → 2180.86] So instead of,
[2180.94 → 2181.08] well,
[2181.10 → 2183.00] actually I guess he introduced the handle
[2183.00 → 2184.96] back when he launched his rap channel.
[2185.66 → 2186.04] So he had,
[2186.24 → 2186.36] yeah,
[2186.36 → 2187.80] it was around for a while,
[2187.80 → 2190.06] but now he's brought it into his main tech persona.
[2190.20 → 2192.00] So Lou later was like his,
[2192.02 → 2192.20] uh,
[2192.20 → 2193.18] his rapper name,
[2193.40 → 2194.28] rapper persona.
[2194.64 → 2195.52] And then,
[2195.54 → 2196.02] um,
[2196.14 → 2197.76] after some period of time,
[2197.86 → 2198.98] the Lou later,
[2198.98 → 2199.46] uh,
[2199.46 → 2201.28] music disappeared from the channel
[2201.28 → 2203.34] and he's kind of rebranded himself
[2203.34 → 2204.16] to Lou later.
[2204.40 → 2207.44] And now he has the Lou later podcast channel
[2207.44 → 2208.80] that used to be the music channel,
[2208.80 → 2210.96] but now it's podcast and like clips and stuff.
[2211.56 → 2211.96] Um,
[2212.12 → 2212.24] Oh,
[2212.26 → 2213.60] Lou clips is it or later.
[2213.60 → 2214.10] That's true.
[2214.22 → 2215.26] Later clips is a different thing.
[2215.32 → 2215.66] So anyway,
[2215.66 → 2216.50] so he's Lou later now,
[2216.50 → 2217.00] so that's fine.
[2217.44 → 2217.70] Um,
[2217.70 → 2220.00] so the later case was one word,
[2220.08 → 2222.04] according to his video,
[2222.04 → 2222.74] uh,
[2222.74 → 2225.40] made because he didn't like other cases
[2225.40 → 2226.48] that were on the market.
[2227.34 → 2227.78] And,
[2227.88 → 2228.50] um,
[2228.50 → 2230.80] so he was like,
[2230.86 → 2231.00] well,
[2231.10 → 2231.32] you know,
[2231.36 → 2231.68] screw it.
[2231.68 → 2232.34] I'll make my own.
[2232.70 → 2234.28] So I'm just going to go through
[2234.28 → 2235.80] my talking points here
[2235.80 → 2237.96] before I offer any colour commentary
[2237.96 → 2238.78] or opinion.
[2239.78 → 2241.64] So Lou released a case
[2241.64 → 2242.76] called the later case.
[2242.94 → 2243.88] It's very thin
[2243.88 → 2245.12] with a Keller style
[2245.12 → 2246.12] weaved finish.
[2247.02 → 2248.22] Case maker Jataka
[2248.22 → 2250.42] claims that Lou ripped off their design.
[2250.42 → 2251.88] Um,
[2252.12 → 2252.46] oh wow,
[2252.52 → 2253.34] this isn't really like
[2253.34 → 2255.30] in order of things that happened.
[2255.50 → 2255.70] Eh,
[2255.70 → 2256.20] it kind of is.
[2256.28 → 2256.52] Okay,
[2256.64 → 2256.90] fine.
[2257.38 → 2257.56] Uh,
[2257.76 → 2258.44] Social Blade,
[2258.50 → 2259.02] and this was,
[2259.06 → 2260.64] this was found by FrontPageTech
[2260.64 → 2261.18] and,
[2261.30 → 2261.64] um,
[2261.70 → 2262.44] the other YouTuber
[2262.44 → 2263.78] that worked on it as well.
[2263.90 → 2264.52] I'm so sorry,
[2264.58 → 2265.24] I forget his name.
[2265.82 → 2266.24] Um,
[2267.30 → 2268.54] so Social Blade shows
[2268.54 → 2269.98] that the day before
[2269.98 → 2271.70] Lou released the launch promo video
[2271.70 → 2272.84] for the later case,
[2272.92 → 2273.72] I believe it was a Saturday.
[2273.84 → 2274.92] You wrote Lou case in here.
[2275.14 → 2277.44] I kept saying Lou case in my head.
[2277.56 → 2278.36] I couldn't stop.
[2278.44 → 2279.20] So the day before,
[2279.30 → 2280.04] his channel dropped
[2280.04 → 2281.32] four and a half million views
[2281.32 → 2282.96] suggesting that a video
[2282.96 → 2284.30] with a lot of views
[2284.30 → 2285.94] had been set to private
[2285.94 → 2286.66] or deleted.
[2287.10 → 2287.32] Um,
[2287.32 → 2288.14] cause that's what happens
[2288.14 → 2289.34] when you remove a video
[2289.34 → 2289.96] from the platform.
[2290.08 → 2290.80] You don't get to like
[2290.80 → 2291.92] keep those views.
[2292.60 → 2293.00] Um,
[2293.42 → 2293.92] also,
[2294.26 → 2294.90] incidentally,
[2295.30 → 2296.22] previous videos
[2296.22 → 2297.06] where he covered
[2297.06 → 2298.38] the Jataka case
[2298.38 → 2300.20] and in fact
[2300.20 → 2301.20] praised it
[2301.20 → 2301.92] saying that it was
[2301.92 → 2302.78] perfect
[2302.78 → 2304.28] and amazingly thin,
[2304.78 → 2305.14] um,
[2305.24 → 2306.46] those appear to be
[2306.46 → 2307.56] no longer available
[2307.56 → 2309.18] which seems like
[2309.18 → 2309.98] sort of,
[2310.02 → 2310.36] um,
[2310.54 → 2310.80] uh,
[2310.86 → 2311.02] an
[2311.10 → 2311.46] um,
[2311.46 → 2312.10] um,
[2312.10 → 2314.28] an unlikely coincidence
[2314.28 → 2315.52] that some videos
[2315.52 → 2316.50] disappeared the day
[2316.50 → 2317.30] before he launched
[2317.30 → 2317.80] his case
[2317.80 → 2318.56] and,
[2318.56 → 2319.42] um,
[2319.84 → 2320.58] there are no longer
[2320.58 → 2321.60] any Jataka case
[2321.60 → 2322.46] videos on his channel
[2322.46 → 2323.70] even though there are
[2323.70 → 2324.96] clips including
[2324.96 → 2326.28] on Jataka's website
[2326.28 → 2327.10] or at least there used
[2327.10 → 2327.40] to be.
[2327.48 → 2328.32] He issued a copyright
[2328.32 → 2328.90] takedown
[2328.90 → 2329.82] for that clip.
[2330.34 → 2330.82] Um,
[2330.94 → 2331.56] even though there are
[2331.56 → 2332.46] clips of him
[2332.46 → 2334.20] reviewing Jataka case
[2334.20 → 2334.80] and talking about
[2334.80 → 2335.58] how much he likes it.
[2335.68 → 2335.78] Well,
[2335.84 → 2336.32] that's his,
[2336.36 → 2336.68] uh,
[2336.98 → 2337.82] defence for this
[2337.82 → 2338.64] apparent coincidence
[2338.64 → 2340.22] is that the reason
[2340.22 → 2341.30] that these Jataka
[2341.30 → 2342.28] videos are not
[2342.28 → 2343.14] no longer there
[2343.14 → 2344.06] is because Jataka
[2344.06 → 2345.26] was using clips
[2345.26 → 2346.48] from his videos
[2346.48 → 2346.80] as,
[2346.92 → 2346.96] like,
[2347.02 → 2347.54] free advertising
[2347.54 → 2348.12] which happens
[2348.12 → 2348.92] all the time.
[2349.10 → 2349.62] I can talk about
[2349.62 → 2350.20] that later.
[2350.82 → 2351.20] Um,
[2351.28 → 2352.84] so it is speculated,
[2352.96 → 2353.44] we have no way
[2353.44 → 2354.14] of confirming this,
[2354.46 → 2355.82] that Lou set
[2355.82 → 2356.80] his Jataka videos
[2356.80 → 2357.26] to private
[2357.26 → 2358.32] just before
[2358.32 → 2358.88] the later case
[2358.88 → 2359.24] launch.
[2359.94 → 2360.30] Um,
[2361.20 → 2362.50] front page tech
[2362.50 → 2363.56] alleged that Lou
[2363.56 → 2364.48] simply ordered
[2364.48 → 2365.54] cases from Alibaba.
[2366.06 → 2366.34] Uh,
[2366.42 → 2367.44] Lou made a follow-up
[2367.44 → 2368.58] video saying
[2368.58 → 2369.70] that he did not
[2369.70 → 2370.24] order them from
[2370.24 → 2370.72] AliExpress,
[2371.10 → 2372.14] which is not the
[2372.14 → 2373.46] same as Alibaba.
[2373.68 → 2374.20] They're actually
[2374.20 → 2375.10] completely different
[2375.10 → 2376.64] and it is very likely
[2376.64 → 2377.68] that Lou sourced
[2377.68 → 2378.64] a factory to work
[2378.64 → 2379.38] with through Alibaba.
[2379.50 → 2379.96] We've done it,
[2380.00 → 2380.78] lots of people do it.
[2380.90 → 2381.20] Well,
[2381.26 → 2381.92] in his video,
[2382.04 → 2383.32] he shows Alibaba.
[2383.66 → 2383.80] Like,
[2383.84 → 2384.10] I don't know
[2384.10 → 2384.82] if you're saying
[2384.82 → 2385.42] that he said
[2385.42 → 2386.24] verbally AliExpress,
[2386.36 → 2387.82] but he shows Alibaba.
[2388.20 → 2388.60] Yeah,
[2388.64 → 2389.20] but just because
[2389.20 → 2389.86] you've done a bunch
[2389.86 → 2390.46] of revisions,
[2390.58 → 2390.70] like,
[2390.74 → 2391.86] that's how Alibaba works.
[2392.02 → 2392.20] Yeah.
[2392.20 → 2392.88] There are products
[2392.88 → 2393.88] for sale on there,
[2393.98 → 2394.84] but then you just,
[2394.98 → 2395.70] you find something
[2395.70 → 2396.66] that's kind of similar
[2396.66 → 2397.40] to what you're trying
[2397.40 → 2397.92] to make.
[2398.06 → 2398.76] You reach out,
[2398.82 → 2399.04] you go,
[2399.14 → 2399.26] okay,
[2399.32 → 2400.16] here are the things
[2400.16 → 2401.06] that I want to change.
[2401.14 → 2401.94] Do you have the capabilities
[2401.94 → 2402.70] to do this?
[2402.80 → 2403.66] They say yes or no.
[2403.82 → 2404.76] They give you a quote,
[2405.00 → 2405.74] you get a sample.
[2406.08 → 2406.94] The sample sucks.
[2407.00 → 2407.84] The sample sucks,
[2407.94 → 2409.18] usually on the first try.
[2409.60 → 2410.40] You tell them,
[2410.48 → 2410.62] okay,
[2410.64 → 2411.22] we need to change
[2411.22 → 2412.08] this and this and this,
[2412.20 → 2413.34] or you send them,
[2413.48 → 2413.76] you know,
[2413.80 → 2414.82] an example of something
[2414.82 → 2415.80] that you think
[2415.80 → 2416.98] is better.
[2417.10 → 2417.20] Like,
[2417.26 → 2418.00] I want it reinforced,
[2418.08 → 2418.66] I want the
[2418.76 → 2418.96] you know,
[2418.96 → 2420.08] bottom part reinforced
[2420.08 → 2421.96] kind of like this,
[2421.96 → 2422.80] like I've got this
[2422.80 → 2424.14] really cool material
[2424.14 → 2425.20] that we found on this,
[2425.34 → 2425.52] like,
[2425.84 → 2426.06] you know,
[2426.14 → 2426.48] hat.
[2426.58 → 2427.12] We'd like something
[2427.12 → 2427.88] similar to that,
[2427.96 → 2428.58] but over here,
[2428.66 → 2428.94] like you,
[2429.00 → 2429.60] you kind of say,
[2429.68 → 2429.78] okay,
[2429.82 → 2430.28] here's what we need
[2430.28 → 2430.64] to change.
[2430.76 → 2431.62] You go back and forth
[2431.62 → 2432.24] a bunch of times.
[2432.24 → 2432.54] I mean,
[2432.86 → 2433.86] something as simple
[2433.86 → 2435.00] as the stealth hoodie,
[2435.12 → 2435.88] you might think,
[2435.96 → 2436.08] okay,
[2436.14 → 2436.26] yeah,
[2436.26 → 2436.42] what?
[2436.42 → 2436.88] It's a hoodie.
[2436.88 → 2437.68] What could you possibly
[2437.68 → 2438.16] get wrong?
[2438.24 → 2438.34] I mean,
[2438.38 → 2439.50] we would do four,
[2439.60 → 2439.82] five,
[2439.96 → 2440.88] six sample rounds
[2440.88 → 2441.66] or something like that
[2441.66 → 2443.16] because if you're going
[2443.16 → 2444.40] to order thousands of units,
[2444.46 → 2445.06] which is exactly
[2445.06 → 2445.80] what you have to do
[2445.80 → 2446.76] if you're ordering off,
[2446.88 → 2447.54] like directly from
[2447.54 → 2448.26] a Chinese factory,
[2448.26 → 2449.26] you need to make sure
[2449.26 → 2449.88] that they're right.
[2450.32 → 2451.68] And those Chinese factories
[2451.68 → 2453.58] are not giving you a refund.
[2453.72 → 2453.96] Like,
[2454.00 → 2455.06] there's no net terms.
[2455.40 → 2456.24] You pay up front
[2456.24 → 2457.14] a lot of the time.
[2457.52 → 2458.98] You give a lot of the time
[2458.98 → 2460.04] as much as 25,
[2460.30 → 2461.76] 50% in advance
[2461.76 → 2463.10] of them even manufacturing it.
[2463.20 → 2464.16] And then you give the rest
[2464.16 → 2465.50] before they even ship it to you.
[2465.50 → 2467.18] So that's like how it works.
[2467.50 → 2469.38] All you can really hope for
[2469.38 → 2471.04] is that the vast majority
[2471.04 → 2471.94] of the products
[2471.94 → 2474.26] look exactly like the sample
[2474.26 → 2475.22] that you agreed on.
[2475.72 → 2476.66] So he did all that.
[2476.76 → 2477.86] He has all these samples there.
[2478.24 → 2480.00] He goes through meticulous detail,
[2480.28 → 2481.60] all the things that he thought
[2481.60 → 2482.50] were important to a case
[2482.50 → 2483.14] that he changed.
[2483.40 → 2484.50] And all that's just to show
[2484.50 → 2486.06] or respond to the criticism
[2486.06 → 2486.44] that,
[2486.78 → 2487.02] man,
[2487.16 → 2489.10] you just bought 500 of this case
[2489.10 → 2490.80] that is the first result
[2490.80 → 2491.74] when you type in
[2491.74 → 2493.02] carbon fibre looking case
[2493.02 → 2493.64] on Alibaba.
[2493.76 → 2494.60] And you just bought them
[2494.60 → 2495.28] and now you're flipping them
[2495.28 → 2496.36] for $45 a case.
[2496.56 → 2498.42] He did some work.
[2498.62 → 2499.86] He went through all that.
[2500.00 → 2500.64] And that's what he's showing
[2500.64 → 2501.40] in that response video.
[2501.54 → 2501.66] Yeah.
[2503.64 → 2506.54] So apparently Lou did reach out
[2506.54 → 2507.20] to Jataka about
[2507.20 → 2508.16] a possible partnership.
[2508.36 → 2509.20] Appears this was after
[2509.20 → 2510.68] the later case video launch though.
[2510.92 → 2511.86] That's what we don't know for sure.
[2512.14 → 2512.42] Yeah.
[2512.54 → 2513.92] I don't think that was
[2513.92 → 2514.56] what he was saying.
[2515.54 → 2516.18] Who was saying?
[2516.50 → 2516.68] Lou.
[2517.38 → 2518.42] That it was after or before?
[2518.78 → 2519.52] Yeah, I thought he was saying
[2519.52 → 2520.12] it was before,
[2520.22 → 2521.28] but it just didn't work out
[2521.28 → 2521.56] or something.
[2522.24 → 2522.94] Well, that's unclear.
[2522.94 → 2523.76] I think he's,
[2523.82 → 2525.04] it's kind of ambiguous.
[2525.42 → 2526.64] I think he's trying to make it seem,
[2526.78 → 2527.56] at the very least,
[2527.60 → 2528.28] he's trying to make it seem
[2528.28 → 2529.50] like it was before.
[2529.76 → 2529.94] Yeah.
[2530.08 → 2532.24] But the people at Jataka
[2532.24 → 2533.34] don't say that it was before.
[2533.84 → 2534.76] There's like this clip
[2534.76 → 2536.16] where one of the YouTubers
[2536.16 → 2538.12] was speaking like on the phone
[2538.12 → 2538.94] or voice over IP
[2538.94 → 2540.88] with James Zhang of Jataka
[2540.88 → 2542.32] who says that
[2542.32 → 2544.02] Lou reached out to him after.
[2544.80 → 2545.00] Oh.
[2545.08 → 2546.10] That's the way it seems
[2546.10 → 2548.06] from what he said.
[2548.16 → 2548.90] So that's kind of unclear.
[2549.22 → 2550.20] Zhang also said in a tweet,
[2550.20 → 2551.64] when did you contact any of us?
[2554.04 → 2555.30] So, all right.
[2555.38 → 2556.80] So now we can move into
[2556.80 → 2560.96] Lou issuing a copyright claim
[2560.96 → 2561.88] against Jataka
[2561.88 → 2565.04] for the video that featured him
[2565.04 → 2566.12] that they were using
[2566.12 → 2567.30] in a video called
[2567.30 → 2569.60] What They Say About Jataka Phone Case,
[2569.68 → 2570.72] which they had uploaded.
[2571.94 → 2574.02] So we've done the same thing.
[2574.30 → 2575.98] We've issued copyright claims
[2575.98 → 2578.08] where our video,
[2578.56 → 2578.80] I mean,
[2579.04 → 2579.66] okay.
[2580.48 → 2581.54] So it's a fine line.
[2581.66 → 2583.28] We could issue a copyright claim
[2583.28 → 2585.78] at pretty much any time
[2585.78 → 2586.88] over something like that.
[2586.94 → 2589.10] Any use of our likeness,
[2589.36 → 2590.32] of my likeness
[2590.32 → 2591.42] or James' likeness
[2591.42 → 2593.54] or a quote from us
[2593.54 → 2596.22] that we're not comfortable with
[2596.22 → 2596.80] in any way,
[2597.14 → 2598.66] we could issue a takedown for
[2598.66 → 2600.64] and we do on a very regular basis.
[2600.92 → 2603.08] And usually when that happens,
[2603.48 → 2605.20] it's because someone has taken
[2605.20 → 2606.00] something that we said
[2606.00 → 2606.90] out of context.
[2608.50 → 2610.20] So an example of that would be
[2610.20 → 2611.86] if I were to say something like,
[2612.68 → 2614.80] if it weren't for
[2614.80 → 2616.98] problem A, problem B,
[2617.06 → 2617.92] and problem C,
[2618.16 → 2619.00] I would say,
[2619.36 → 2620.92] this is the best phone on the market.
[2621.56 → 2622.32] And if they go
[2622.32 → 2623.44] and they put a quote on their site
[2623.44 → 2624.80] that says dot, dot, dot,
[2625.14 → 2626.56] this is the best phone on the market,
[2626.66 → 2627.32] Linus Sebastian,
[2627.46 → 2627.80] I'd be like,
[2627.86 → 2629.22] yo, you need to take that down
[2629.22 → 2630.06] immediately
[2630.06 → 2631.46] because that isn't what I said.
[2631.52 → 2632.92] That wasn't the spirit
[2632.92 → 2633.96] of what I was saying.
[2633.96 → 2635.48] So that's an example.
[2635.62 → 2636.44] Well, the other thing is
[2636.44 → 2637.78] sometimes they'll go to a website
[2637.78 → 2639.16] and they'll just have your footage.
[2639.72 → 2640.34] And, you know,
[2640.38 → 2641.42] they didn't pay to use
[2641.42 → 2642.20] your footage that way.
[2642.48 → 2644.20] So another example
[2644.20 → 2646.94] is when they're using
[2646.94 → 2648.76] our video
[2648.76 → 2650.74] or our branding
[2650.74 → 2651.98] or our image
[2651.98 → 2653.46] in a way that makes it appear
[2653.46 → 2654.54] as though the relationship
[2654.54 → 2655.82] is something other than
[2655.82 → 2657.76] we as an independent third party
[2657.76 → 2658.54] reviewed a product
[2658.54 → 2659.42] that they made.
[2659.42 → 2661.82] So I've seen my face.
[2661.96 → 2663.24] I actually ran into this
[2663.24 → 2664.32] with a company
[2664.32 → 2664.78] that makes
[2664.78 → 2667.50] really compact laptops,
[2667.66 → 2668.74] like tiny laptops.
[2669.24 → 2670.76] And on one of their pages,
[2671.40 → 2672.46] they had like,
[2672.88 → 2673.90] like me,
[2674.32 → 2675.22] like pictures of me
[2675.22 → 2675.94] that like stills
[2675.94 → 2676.86] that they had just pulled
[2676.86 → 2678.22] like embedded all over
[2678.22 → 2678.68] and I was like,
[2679.38 → 2680.48] and quotes and stuff.
[2680.52 → 2680.84] And I was like,
[2680.88 → 2681.02] look,
[2681.08 → 2682.34] you guys are really making this
[2682.34 → 2683.56] look like an endorsement
[2683.56 → 2683.98] or something.
[2683.98 → 2685.20] I just reviewed the product.
[2685.36 → 2686.42] It's this,
[2686.54 → 2687.28] this looks like
[2687.28 → 2688.42] too close of a relationship
[2688.42 → 2689.18] and that's not
[2689.18 → 2690.06] what's happening here.
[2690.22 → 2690.54] Plus they're making
[2690.54 → 2691.88] derivative marketing materials
[2691.88 → 2693.22] with your original work
[2693.22 → 2694.00] and they didn't pay for that.
[2694.02 → 2694.24] I was like,
[2694.28 → 2694.40] look,
[2694.48 → 2695.42] I like the product
[2695.42 → 2696.30] and they fixed it
[2696.30 → 2697.10] and we've worked with them
[2697.10 → 2697.90] again since then
[2697.90 → 2698.76] and it's all good.
[2699.22 → 2700.44] But I think that was a case
[2700.44 → 2701.00] where they just didn't
[2701.00 → 2701.82] really understand
[2701.82 → 2703.54] that when you embed
[2703.54 → 2704.68] a lot of imagery
[2704.68 → 2705.92] of someone else
[2705.92 → 2706.84] all over your product page,
[2706.88 → 2707.96] it makes it seem like
[2707.96 → 2709.46] some kind of sponsorship
[2709.46 → 2710.40] or paid endorsement
[2710.40 → 2711.40] and it wasn't.
[2711.40 → 2712.62] So that's another case
[2712.62 → 2714.10] where we would ask them
[2714.10 → 2715.06] to pull down,
[2715.16 → 2715.70] you know,
[2715.72 → 2716.24] any images
[2716.24 → 2717.42] or quotes from us.
[2717.42 → 2719.12] And then the third one
[2719.12 → 2720.24] was the one you mentioned
[2720.24 → 2721.58] where they are using it
[2721.58 → 2723.18] as marketing collateral
[2723.18 → 2725.32] where there would be
[2725.32 → 2726.30] an opportunity for us
[2726.30 → 2727.44] to charge a licensing fee
[2727.44 → 2728.02] for it
[2728.02 → 2729.34] and they haven't.
[2729.44 → 2729.66] Now,
[2729.78 → 2730.90] we don't actually
[2730.90 → 2732.54] do that very often.
[2733.14 → 2733.96] The only time
[2733.96 → 2734.78] that really comes up
[2734.78 → 2735.40] for us
[2735.40 → 2736.38] is when they want
[2736.38 → 2737.86] to re-upload the content
[2737.86 → 2739.18] and or embed it
[2739.18 → 2739.78] on their website
[2739.78 → 2740.90] and in this case,
[2741.36 → 2742.32] that appears to be
[2742.32 → 2743.40] exactly what Jataka
[2743.40 → 2744.00] has done.
[2744.50 → 2744.72] So,
[2745.10 → 2746.10] I'm not going to say
[2746.10 → 2746.90] that I would have
[2746.90 → 2748.04] necessarily behaved
[2748.04 → 2749.10] any differently
[2749.10 → 2750.02] than Lou.
[2750.30 → 2751.02] The only thing
[2751.02 → 2752.00] that's weird about it
[2752.00 → 2752.76] is the timing
[2752.76 → 2753.96] where the copyright
[2753.96 → 2755.38] notice was issued
[2755.38 → 2757.30] right before the launch
[2757.30 → 2758.36] of the later case.
[2759.22 → 2759.62] Yeah,
[2759.72 → 2760.52] it's especially weird
[2760.52 → 2760.90] because,
[2761.16 → 2762.12] and yes,
[2762.16 → 2762.58] I'm sick,
[2762.84 → 2763.06] guys,
[2763.12 → 2763.68] that's why my voice
[2763.68 → 2764.32] sounds like this.
[2765.22 → 2765.88] It's weird
[2765.88 → 2767.18] because on the one hand,
[2767.30 → 2767.62] you're like,
[2767.70 → 2767.84] look,
[2767.90 → 2768.50] he made a case
[2768.50 → 2769.08] that looks a lot
[2769.08 → 2769.92] like this other case
[2769.92 → 2771.02] and that case,
[2771.06 → 2772.00] he sang the praises of.
[2772.36 → 2772.44] Yeah.
[2772.44 → 2772.62] So,
[2772.86 → 2774.00] if this really was,
[2774.08 → 2774.16] like,
[2774.18 → 2774.92] let's say he worked
[2774.92 → 2775.98] with Jataka
[2775.98 → 2777.02] and his case
[2777.02 → 2777.60] was really just
[2777.60 → 2778.70] a rebranded Jataka case,
[2778.82 → 2779.50] he probably would
[2779.50 → 2780.42] keep that video up
[2780.42 → 2781.30] because it's like,
[2781.42 → 2781.60] look,
[2781.76 → 2782.44] I got this case
[2782.44 → 2782.86] back then,
[2782.96 → 2783.64] I loved it
[2783.64 → 2784.10] and I loved it
[2784.10 → 2784.40] so much,
[2784.44 → 2784.92] I made another one.
[2785.14 → 2786.34] And we made a couple
[2786.34 → 2786.80] of tweaks
[2786.80 → 2787.52] that make it,
[2787.60 → 2787.86] like,
[2787.96 → 2788.24] you know,
[2788.60 → 2789.32] later edition
[2789.32 → 2789.76] or whatever.
[2789.96 → 2790.74] But on the other hand,
[2791.60 → 2793.02] it's like,
[2793.36 → 2794.46] Jataka says themselves
[2794.46 → 2795.02] that they're like
[2795.02 → 2795.92] a leader in this space
[2795.92 → 2796.50] or they're a very
[2796.50 → 2797.74] well-known company
[2797.74 → 2798.62] in this case.
[2798.64 → 2799.32] I'd never heard of them.
[2799.32 → 2800.92] They claim,
[2801.00 → 2801.18] at least,
[2801.24 → 2801.56] that they have
[2801.56 → 2802.18] a lot of market share
[2802.18 → 2802.70] in this space.
[2802.90 → 2803.72] If that's true,
[2803.78 → 2804.44] it stands to reason
[2804.44 → 2805.28] that a lot of,
[2805.32 → 2805.44] like,
[2805.64 → 2806.92] the Alibaba-type companies
[2806.92 → 2807.42] would be like,
[2807.52 → 2808.26] let's just make
[2808.26 → 2809.90] a carbon copy of that.
[2810.02 → 2810.94] Literally a carbon copy.
[2811.22 → 2811.54] Get it?
[2812.06 → 2812.30] Well,
[2812.34 → 2813.10] they're not literally carbon.
[2813.78 → 2813.98] But,
[2814.64 → 2815.16] so it's,
[2815.28 → 2816.36] there's a ton of copycat
[2816.36 → 2817.32] things on Alibaba.
[2817.40 → 2818.26] So if you're popular,
[2818.40 → 2818.78] there will be
[2818.78 → 2819.56] a copycat version.
[2820.04 → 2820.30] So,
[2821.30 → 2823.32] did he copy them
[2823.32 → 2823.76] or not?
[2824.14 → 2825.16] Did everybody copy them?
[2825.24 → 2826.10] Did he just grab,
[2826.38 → 2826.52] like,
[2826.98 → 2827.86] is it so copy
[2827.86 → 2828.46] that it's generic?
[2828.46 → 2829.62] Is it a commodity now?
[2829.72 → 2830.12] And there's just
[2830.12 → 2830.66] a million cases
[2830.66 → 2831.32] that look like that
[2831.32 → 2832.58] and just kind of,
[2832.78 → 2833.18] of course,
[2833.30 → 2834.42] it looks like somebody's
[2834.42 → 2835.14] and that somebody
[2835.14 → 2835.58] in this case
[2835.58 → 2836.42] happens to be Pit aka.
[2836.58 → 2837.68] People seem to be,
[2837.68 → 2837.90] like,
[2838.12 → 2839.18] watching a different stream
[2839.18 → 2840.26] than this one.
[2840.84 → 2841.54] Outer says,
[2841.64 → 2842.00] no, man,
[2842.04 → 2842.94] you guys are so wrong
[2842.94 → 2843.44] on this issue.
[2843.52 → 2844.26] He didn't make it.
[2844.76 → 2845.30] What are you even
[2845.30 → 2845.94] talking about?
[2846.86 → 2847.16] Nobody,
[2847.36 → 2847.46] nobody makes...
[2847.46 → 2847.52] Well,
[2847.52 → 2848.22] what's your definition
[2848.22 → 2848.62] of make?
[2848.64 → 2849.86] Nobody makes anything
[2849.86 → 2850.88] unless they actually
[2850.88 → 2851.58] are the worker
[2851.58 → 2852.60] on the assembly line
[2852.60 → 2853.18] in the factory
[2853.18 → 2853.78] in China
[2853.78 → 2855.24] literally making it.
[2855.24 → 2855.92] Like,
[2855.96 → 2856.76] we're talking about
[2856.76 → 2858.44] sourcing from overseas.
[2859.66 → 2860.40] So I...
[2860.40 → 2861.10] In that sense,
[2861.14 → 2861.72] we don't make
[2861.72 → 2862.76] our LTQ water bottle.
[2863.08 → 2863.34] No.
[2864.00 → 2864.68] We don't.
[2864.80 → 2865.52] We found something
[2865.52 → 2867.10] that was pretty close
[2867.10 → 2868.56] and then we customized it
[2868.56 → 2869.22] to reach the point
[2869.22 → 2870.38] where we were happy with it.
[2870.56 → 2870.70] Well,
[2870.70 → 2871.18] I guess we made
[2871.18 → 2871.94] the design on it.
[2872.24 → 2872.64] Absolutely.
[2874.22 → 2874.62] So,
[2874.76 → 2875.30] in that case,
[2875.40 → 2875.56] yeah,
[2875.66 → 2876.62] like a lot of apparel,
[2876.76 → 2877.28] like a shirt,
[2877.66 → 2878.36] you're not really
[2878.36 → 2879.32] buying a water bottle,
[2879.40 → 2880.34] you're buying a design
[2880.34 → 2880.94] that you like
[2880.94 → 2881.40] and it happens
[2881.40 → 2882.30] to be on a water bottle.
[2883.46 → 2884.74] So in that sense,
[2885.38 → 2886.22] if Lou changed
[2886.22 → 2887.22] anything about the case,
[2887.28 → 2887.84] my understanding
[2887.84 → 2888.66] is there are actually
[2888.66 → 2889.54] a couple of differences.
[2890.04 → 2890.78] If you changed anything
[2890.78 → 2891.48] about the case,
[2891.52 → 2892.38] then you are paying
[2892.38 → 2893.46] for the work
[2893.46 → 2894.38] and the time
[2894.38 → 2895.38] that Lou put into
[2895.38 → 2896.94] working with the manufacturer
[2896.94 → 2897.88] because no,
[2897.96 → 2899.52] no YouTuber makes anything.
[2900.52 → 2901.18] Who was it
[2901.18 → 2901.76] who just did
[2901.76 → 2903.48] that big makeup launch?
[2905.48 → 2906.24] Shane Dawson?
[2906.54 → 2907.10] I don't know.
[2907.48 → 2907.66] Yeah.
[2908.04 → 2908.76] I think it was
[2908.76 → 2909.46] Shane Dawson
[2909.46 → 2910.92] and James...
[2910.94 → 2911.54] Charles?
[2911.92 → 2912.26] Sorry,
[2912.32 → 2913.06] I'm not perfect
[2913.06 → 2913.60] at the like
[2913.60 → 2914.34] famous YouTubers.
[2915.00 → 2915.40] Anyway,
[2915.68 → 2916.30] they didn't make
[2916.30 → 2916.90] that makeup.
[2917.36 → 2918.10] They didn't like
[2918.10 → 2918.90] go and do
[2918.90 → 2920.06] laboratory testing
[2920.06 → 2920.94] to ensure it's safe
[2920.94 → 2921.58] to put on your skin.
[2921.66 → 2922.06] They left that
[2922.06 → 2922.72] to the professionals.
[2923.00 → 2923.94] Thank goodness
[2923.94 → 2925.40] they didn't make makeup.
[2925.62 → 2926.78] I didn't make a water bottle
[2926.78 → 2928.18] and Lou didn't make a case
[2928.18 → 2929.16] because we would have
[2929.16 → 2930.06] no idea what we're doing
[2930.06 → 2931.20] and it would probably suck.
[2931.74 → 2932.80] So you're paying
[2932.80 → 2935.14] for them to
[2935.14 → 2936.82] order the volume
[2936.82 → 2937.40] that's needed
[2937.40 → 2937.94] in order to make
[2937.94 → 2938.90] the costs reasonable.
[2939.14 → 2939.94] You're paying for them
[2939.94 → 2940.46] to promote it.
[2940.46 → 2941.20] You're paying for them
[2941.20 → 2942.62] to consult on the design
[2942.62 → 2943.28] or any changes
[2943.28 → 2944.12] that they're making to it
[2944.12 → 2944.72] and you're paying
[2944.72 → 2945.32] for their time
[2945.32 → 2946.38] coordinating the whole thing.
[2946.52 → 2947.22] Well, people take issue
[2947.22 → 2947.72] with the cost
[2947.72 → 2949.18] because it's a $45 case.
[2950.20 → 2951.06] Oh, Jeffree Star.
[2951.20 → 2951.48] Sorry.
[2952.14 → 2954.06] If you look at the...
[2954.06 → 2955.14] If you were to just buy
[2955.14 → 2956.22] the MOQ,
[2956.36 → 2957.78] like the unit price
[2957.78 → 2959.16] is I think at most $14
[2959.16 → 2960.22] or something like that.
[2960.50 → 2961.48] But in his video,
[2961.56 → 2962.50] Lou explains that,
[2962.62 → 2962.80] you know,
[2962.86 → 2963.68] he's warehousing
[2963.68 → 2964.72] all of these units
[2964.72 → 2965.64] in, I believe,
[2966.34 → 2967.52] Ontario in Canada
[2967.52 → 2968.46] so that real estate
[2968.46 → 2969.16] has a cost.
[2969.24 → 2969.80] He has to warehouse
[2969.80 → 2970.36] all of them
[2970.36 → 2971.22] and he does...
[2971.22 → 2972.32] It's not just one case.
[2972.34 → 2973.14] That cost is very low.
[2973.16 → 2974.24] He's trying to support...
[2974.24 → 2974.74] But the thing is
[2974.74 → 2976.60] that cost of the iPhone one
[2976.60 → 2978.28] is subsidizing the cost
[2978.28 → 2979.26] of the other devices
[2979.26 → 2980.60] that he plans to support.
[2980.74 → 2982.06] So there's not that many people
[2982.06 → 2982.94] with a OnePlus 7
[2982.94 → 2984.34] and he wants to support that one.
[2985.86 → 2986.72] It's a loss-leader.
[2987.02 → 2987.26] Yep.
[2987.34 → 2987.66] In a way.
[2987.80 → 2988.46] So that's fair.
[2988.46 → 2991.90] Shane Dawson and Jeffree Star.
[2992.00 → 2992.74] Yeah, got it guys.
[2992.86 → 2993.20] Got it.
[2993.26 → 2993.54] Got it.
[2993.56 → 2993.82] Got it.
[2993.84 → 2994.08] Got it.
[2994.08 → 2994.32] Sorry.
[2994.46 → 2995.20] I'm terrible
[2995.20 → 2995.96] at famous YouTubers.
[2998.30 → 2999.82] So, all right.
[2999.90 → 3000.38] There was something
[3000.38 → 3000.80] that I said
[3000.80 → 3001.76] I would come back to.
[3002.34 → 3003.08] Oh, you said
[3003.08 → 3003.56] you were going to come back
[3003.56 → 3003.76] to the coffee.
[3003.76 → 3005.08] Okay, so that's basically...
[3005.08 → 3006.50] Basically, here's what happened.
[3006.92 → 3008.26] Apparently, he deleted the videos
[3008.26 → 3009.56] which actually makes sense
[3009.56 → 3010.78] because I don't think
[3010.78 → 3011.76] setting them private
[3011.76 → 3013.00] actually deletes the views
[3013.00 → 3013.54] from your channel.
[3013.74 → 3014.62] Oh, I thought I read...
[3014.62 → 3015.64] I thought the...
[3015.64 → 3016.60] I mean, we could test it.
[3016.60 → 3018.08] I thought the front page...
[3018.08 → 3019.84] Video was talking about
[3019.84 → 3021.66] him having it private them.
[3021.82 → 3023.14] Yeah, he might have been mistaken
[3023.14 → 3024.30] because my understanding
[3024.30 → 3025.32] is the views only go away
[3025.32 → 3026.32] if you actually delete it.
[3026.50 → 3026.76] All right.
[3027.04 → 3028.04] Okay, so anyway.
[3028.18 → 3028.90] In a nutshell,
[3029.78 → 3030.70] Lou launched a case.
[3031.46 → 3032.90] He launched it later
[3032.90 → 3034.88] and then before later happened
[3034.88 → 3038.04] allegedly deleted videos
[3038.04 → 3038.84] where...
[3038.84 → 3039.80] And there seems to be
[3039.80 → 3041.28] pretty significant,
[3041.50 → 3042.22] pretty bulletproof
[3042.22 → 3043.16] circumstantial evidence
[3043.16 → 3044.76] that he used to have videos
[3044.76 → 3045.68] on the Jataka case
[3045.68 → 3046.24] on his channel
[3046.24 → 3047.54] saying that he liked it.
[3048.08 → 3049.86] And doesn't anymore.
[3050.16 → 3050.96] So it looks like
[3050.96 → 3051.66] that's pretty much
[3051.66 → 3052.18] what happened.
[3052.88 → 3055.04] He got called out for this.
[3056.36 → 3057.20] Admittedly, in a way
[3057.20 → 3058.14] that would have put me
[3058.14 → 3059.22] on the defensive too.
[3059.90 → 3061.58] Like, front page text video
[3061.58 → 3062.96] was very, you know,
[3063.64 → 3065.32] ha ha, we uncovered your,
[3065.32 → 3065.90] you know,
[3066.48 → 3068.70] your sleazy crap.
[3068.86 → 3070.08] Ha ha, you thought
[3070.08 → 3070.84] we wouldn't notice
[3070.84 → 3071.76] you twit.
[3072.10 → 3073.06] Like, he had kind of
[3073.06 → 3074.00] an attitude about it
[3074.00 → 3074.62] and I can see why
[3074.62 → 3075.34] that would have made Lou
[3075.34 → 3076.58] quite defensive about it.
[3078.32 → 3079.58] So then front page text
[3079.58 → 3080.32] makes this video
[3080.32 → 3080.96] and says, look,
[3081.06 → 3082.86] you claim that you never
[3082.86 → 3083.84] found a case you liked
[3083.84 → 3084.96] so you made this one
[3084.96 → 3086.26] except here's a video
[3086.26 → 3087.42] from you from like
[3087.42 → 3088.26] years ago
[3088.26 → 3089.28] saying how much
[3089.28 → 3090.12] you like this one
[3090.12 → 3090.64] that then yours
[3090.64 → 3091.28] is just like
[3091.28 → 3092.48] almost identical to.
[3092.48 → 3095.64] You know, what are you doing?
[3096.04 → 3097.24] He responded saying
[3097.24 → 3097.78] I'm doing,
[3097.96 → 3099.50] I actually did a lot of work
[3099.50 → 3100.44] and also your video
[3100.44 → 3101.10] was very rude.
[3102.48 → 3104.20] And then front page text,
[3104.24 → 3104.58] I don't know if you
[3104.58 → 3105.58] watched their follow-up video.
[3105.94 → 3106.38] I didn't.
[3106.74 → 3108.00] Basically it was like,
[3108.90 → 3110.56] well, you didn't address
[3110.56 → 3111.58] anything we said
[3111.58 → 3113.38] so that's pretty stupid.
[3114.32 → 3116.48] And my take on all of this
[3116.48 → 3118.32] is Lou could have
[3118.32 → 3119.18] prevented this
[3119.18 → 3120.98] and could still prevent
[3120.98 → 3122.76] any fallout from this
[3122.76 → 3125.02] by just being upfront about it.
[3125.94 → 3127.16] Like, yeah,
[3127.20 → 3128.18] I deleted the videos
[3128.18 → 3129.82] because like,
[3130.02 → 3130.48] well, okay,
[3130.60 → 3130.82] A,
[3131.00 → 3131.60] just shouldn't have
[3131.60 → 3132.42] deleted the videos.
[3132.56 → 3133.32] Should have just said.
[3134.40 → 3135.00] I don't know.
[3135.10 → 3135.44] You know what?
[3135.46 → 3136.00] I don't know.
[3136.06 → 3136.70] I don't know how
[3136.70 → 3138.74] I would have fixed this.
[3139.24 → 3139.64] I mean,
[3139.64 → 3141.40] maybe the launch video
[3141.40 → 3142.44] shouldn't have treated it
[3142.44 → 3144.42] like it was something new then.
[3144.74 → 3145.30] Shouldn't have deleted
[3145.30 → 3145.82] the videos.
[3145.92 → 3146.46] Should have said.
[3146.90 → 3147.66] Because my understanding,
[3147.66 → 3147.94] again,
[3148.00 → 3148.54] is that there are
[3148.54 → 3149.68] a couple of subtle differences
[3149.68 → 3151.00] between the later case
[3151.00 → 3151.68] and the Jataka case.
[3151.70 → 3152.34] Well, the Jataka case
[3152.34 → 3153.28] actually has other features.
[3153.30 → 3153.40] Yeah.
[3153.48 → 3154.46] It's like magnetic things.
[3155.12 → 3155.72] All right.
[3155.80 → 3156.04] Well,
[3156.26 → 3157.22] he should have just focused
[3157.22 → 3158.84] on his differentiating features.
[3160.26 → 3161.54] Been upfront about it.
[3161.72 → 3161.96] I mean,
[3162.00 → 3163.84] now that this is all out there,
[3164.38 → 3165.28] honestly,
[3165.56 → 3167.12] I probably wouldn't have created
[3167.12 → 3168.54] like a podcast episode
[3168.54 → 3169.26] addressing it.
[3169.66 → 3169.98] You know,
[3170.06 → 3171.48] if I was trying to make it
[3171.48 → 3172.86] go away as quickly as possible.
[3175.56 → 3176.16] I don't know.
[3176.16 → 3176.96] This just seems like
[3176.96 → 3177.94] such a self-own.
[3179.26 → 3180.00] I don't know.
[3180.38 → 3180.50] He,
[3180.86 → 3182.44] at least in his response video,
[3182.52 → 3183.12] he's showing you
[3183.12 → 3184.68] that he did put work into it,
[3184.72 → 3186.36] which is an attempt
[3186.36 → 3187.50] to dispel all the criticism
[3187.50 → 3188.58] that he just ordered.
[3188.74 → 3189.68] The front page tech video
[3189.68 → 3190.38] never said
[3190.38 → 3191.44] he didn't put work into it.
[3192.06 → 3192.40] Well,
[3192.44 → 3193.22] a lot of people attack
[3193.22 → 3194.36] his claim when he says,
[3194.50 → 3195.40] so I made a phone.
[3195.68 → 3196.68] So I made one.
[3196.94 → 3197.06] Yeah.
[3197.18 → 3197.90] So I made one.
[3197.90 → 3198.48] And everyone's like,
[3198.54 → 3198.70] no,
[3198.76 → 3199.20] you didn't.
[3199.32 → 3199.66] So like,
[3199.70 → 3200.96] he's responding to that.
[3202.28 → 3203.08] I guess so.
[3203.08 → 3203.48] But to me,
[3203.52 → 3204.68] that's not really the issue here.
[3205.06 → 3206.12] The issue here
[3206.12 → 3208.16] is the removal
[3208.16 → 3209.98] of the Atari case videos
[3209.98 → 3213.10] and like trying
[3213.10 → 3213.70] to sweep something
[3213.70 → 3214.28] under the rug.
[3215.72 → 3216.70] All you had to do
[3216.70 → 3217.70] was just leave it up.
[3217.82 → 3218.72] And then when people are like,
[3218.78 → 3218.86] hey,
[3218.86 → 3219.54] this is really similar
[3219.54 → 3220.26] to the Atari case,
[3220.30 → 3220.62] you say,
[3221.20 → 3221.48] yeah,
[3221.48 → 3223.12] I like the Atari case a lot,
[3223.22 → 3224.36] but here are the things
[3224.36 → 3225.18] that I wanted to change
[3225.18 → 3226.20] to make later case
[3226.20 → 3227.16] different from that
[3227.16 → 3228.06] and better in my mind.
[3228.40 → 3228.48] Yeah.
[3228.66 → 3229.72] That was all,
[3229.84 → 3231.58] that was all it had to be.
[3231.58 → 3235.52] The reality of this though
[3235.52 → 3237.50] is that this issue
[3237.50 → 3238.32] is going to go away.
[3238.96 → 3239.18] I mean,
[3239.22 → 3240.02] just like the truck
[3240.02 → 3240.66] full of iPhones
[3240.66 → 3241.86] that never got given away,
[3243.32 → 3243.60] this,
[3244.16 → 3244.44] I mean,
[3244.48 → 3245.46] the news cycle is what?
[3245.76 → 3246.60] Two days now?
[3246.90 → 3247.16] Maybe?
[3247.86 → 3248.18] I mean,
[3248.22 → 3249.02] in a world where
[3249.02 → 3249.64] you've got,
[3249.78 → 3250.08] you know,
[3250.32 → 3251.86] the drama of,
[3251.98 → 3252.22] you know,
[3252.28 → 3253.86] modern day American politics,
[3254.82 → 3255.38] ultimately,
[3255.96 → 3256.68] how big of a deal
[3256.68 → 3257.24] is a YouTuber
[3257.24 → 3258.22] deleting a video
[3258.22 → 3259.96] and then releasing
[3259.96 → 3260.62] a phone case
[3260.62 → 3261.28] that's very similar
[3261.28 → 3261.92] to the case
[3261.92 → 3263.02] that they praised
[3263.02 → 3263.70] in this video.
[3267.72 → 3268.30] I mean,
[3268.42 → 3268.70] yeah,
[3268.78 → 3269.26] I think it was
[3269.26 → 3270.22] a really stupid,
[3270.68 → 3271.06] you know,
[3271.48 → 3272.78] shoot self in foot moment
[3272.78 → 3273.96] and it was completely
[3273.96 → 3274.56] unnecessary,
[3274.56 → 3275.92] but in the grand scheme
[3275.92 → 3276.22] of things,
[3276.26 → 3276.96] I don't think it's going
[3276.96 → 3277.82] to affect his channel
[3277.82 → 3278.38] or his business.
[3279.06 → 3279.94] So Jataka,
[3280.12 → 3280.82] congratulations
[3280.82 → 3281.78] on all the sales
[3281.78 → 3282.74] you got this week
[3282.74 → 3284.72] from this huge,
[3284.84 → 3287.14] huge publicity bump.
[3287.96 → 3288.24] Yeah,
[3288.34 → 3288.66] I guess,
[3288.80 → 3289.40] I guess that's a better thing.
[3289.40 → 3291.50] I mean,
[3291.62 → 3292.56] it could be deleterious
[3292.56 → 3293.68] in some way
[3293.68 → 3294.88] over the long term,
[3295.12 → 3295.42] maybe,
[3295.56 → 3295.88] but I think
[3295.88 → 3296.58] that would be small
[3296.58 → 3298.12] compared to this exposure
[3298.12 → 3298.80] that they just got.
[3298.92 → 3299.60] I wonder if they've
[3299.60 → 3300.28] ever emailed me.
[3300.74 → 3301.92] I'm just curious now.
[3302.34 → 3302.96] It's not the kind
[3302.96 → 3303.72] of thing I would cover
[3303.72 → 3304.20] because we don't
[3304.20 → 3305.30] really cover phone cases.
[3305.42 → 3305.52] Like,
[3305.56 → 3306.12] how do you make a video
[3306.12 → 3306.88] about a phone case?
[3306.94 → 3307.48] I don't really get it.
[3307.52 → 3308.00] What do you say?
[3309.12 → 3309.68] Just watch
[3309.68 → 3310.58] an unbox therapy video.
[3310.92 → 3311.10] Yeah,
[3311.12 → 3311.58] I guess so.
[3314.40 → 3315.70] Oh my God.
[3315.80 → 3316.18] Oh no,
[3316.28 → 3316.82] you've got a lot.
[3316.88 → 3317.48] Look at all these
[3317.48 → 3318.40] emails from them.
[3318.40 → 3319.10] Oh wow.
[3319.28 → 3319.90] I wonder if they've
[3319.90 → 3320.66] ever emailed me.
[3321.32 → 3321.64] 80,
[3322.30 → 3322.96] 110,
[3323.44 → 3324.00] I don't know,
[3324.18 → 3325.34] a million emails from them.
[3325.36 → 3325.90] I'm still scrolling.
[3326.12 → 3327.52] There's more than one contact here.
[3327.62 → 3328.84] This is like people's careers
[3328.84 → 3329.82] like churning out.
[3330.46 → 3330.62] So,
[3330.78 → 3331.48] I have heard
[3331.48 → 3332.50] from the following
[3332.50 → 3333.70] Jataka employees
[3333.70 → 3334.78] over the last
[3334.78 → 3336.12] three years.
[3336.98 → 3337.40] Ivy,
[3337.40 → 3338.04] Ashley,
[3338.04 → 3338.94] Joanna,
[3339.32 → 3340.42] XU66,
[3341.12 → 3341.84] Annie,
[3342.16 → 3342.64] Crystal,
[3343.30 → 3343.74] Fiona,
[3344.22 → 3344.66] Ashley,
[3344.92 → 3345.30] Abby,
[3345.78 → 3346.26] Rebecca,
[3348.78 → 3349.46] Kitty,
[3351.46 → 3351.94] Kiki,
[3353.08 → 3353.48] Olivia,
[3354.86 → 3355.18] Echo.
[3355.44 → 3356.12] Are these made up?
[3356.50 → 3357.16] I think so.
[3357.84 → 3358.82] There's no way
[3358.82 → 3359.28] that...
[3359.28 → 3360.28] They're all James Gang.
[3361.34 → 3362.38] We're going to be getting
[3362.38 → 3363.42] one from him soon anyway.
[3363.42 → 3364.60] Because these are totally
[3364.60 → 3366.28] all like approachable
[3366.28 → 3367.02] female names.
[3367.12 → 3367.64] You notice that?
[3367.84 → 3368.76] There's no way
[3368.76 → 3369.56] those aren't aliases.
[3369.72 → 3370.46] That's hilarious.
[3371.40 → 3372.84] I can't reply to Kitty.
[3373.20 → 3373.40] Yeah,
[3373.66 → 3374.24] or Kiki.
[3374.70 → 3375.10] All right.
[3375.16 → 3376.06] She sounds adorable.
[3376.06 → 3377.34] So,
[3377.40 → 3378.16] that's pretty funny.
[3380.38 → 3380.86] Wow.
[3380.92 → 3381.44] Oh, man.
[3382.48 → 3383.12] All right.
[3384.24 → 3384.70] So,
[3384.78 → 3385.76] I guess that's pretty much
[3385.76 → 3386.40] all I have to say
[3386.40 → 3387.02] about that.
[3387.20 → 3388.16] The whole situation
[3388.16 → 3389.62] is just totally unnecessary
[3389.62 → 3391.64] by denying it,
[3391.84 → 3393.74] by fighting back
[3393.74 → 3394.56] against it.
[3396.00 → 3396.98] It does nothing
[3396.98 → 3398.04] but make it worse.
[3398.52 → 3400.04] And even as bad
[3400.04 → 3400.58] as it is,
[3400.62 → 3401.74] it just ultimately
[3401.74 → 3403.44] doesn't really matter.
[3403.44 → 3404.92] You know,
[3404.96 → 3405.78] it's not the way
[3405.78 → 3406.40] I would have done it
[3406.40 → 3406.98] for sure
[3406.98 → 3408.78] because I don't really...
[3408.78 → 3409.54] I mean,
[3409.60 → 3410.74] I guess I've self-owned
[3410.74 → 3411.92] enough times
[3411.92 → 3412.88] that I would have seen
[3412.88 → 3413.58] this one coming.
[3414.14 → 3414.50] Nah,
[3414.60 → 3415.02] you're great.
[3416.48 → 3417.68] Speaking of self-owned,
[3417.92 → 3418.72] one last topic
[3418.72 → 3419.50] for you guys today.
[3419.52 → 3419.72] No,
[3419.78 → 3420.24] I have to go.
[3420.46 → 3420.68] Okay,
[3420.72 → 3421.06] that's fine.
[3421.10 → 3421.48] You can go.
[3421.54 → 3422.00] I'll cover it.
[3422.04 → 3422.42] Get out of here.
[3422.48 → 3422.96] See you later.
[3423.20 → 3424.46] Intel resuscitates
[3424.46 → 3425.74] Haswell once again.
[3425.82 → 3426.76] The original article here
[3426.76 → 3427.12] is from
[3427.12 → 3428.52] Tom'sHardware.com.
[3428.58 → 3428.90] Let's go ahead
[3428.90 → 3429.66] and pull that up.
[3429.66 → 3433.68] Thanks for that,
[3433.76 → 3433.98] James.
[3434.04 → 3434.86] That was very charming.
[3435.82 → 3436.30] So guys,
[3436.40 → 3438.16] these are 22 nanometre
[3438.16 → 3438.96] processors
[3438.96 → 3441.62] that Intel discontinued
[3441.62 → 3443.78] three years ago.
[3443.96 → 3445.34] So back in 2015,
[3445.50 → 3445.90] excuse me,
[3445.96 → 3447.64] 2015 was four years ago now.
[3447.72 → 3447.84] Boy,
[3447.92 → 3448.42] time flies.
[3448.98 → 3449.70] Three years ago
[3449.70 → 3450.30] in 2015,
[3450.66 → 3451.98] these are now
[3451.98 → 3453.68] back up for order.
[3453.82 → 3454.50] According to
[3454.50 → 3455.36] the product change
[3455.36 → 3456.46] notification document,
[3456.88 → 3457.48] Intel is
[3457.48 → 3458.88] cancelling this product
[3458.88 → 3459.76] discontinuance
[3459.76 → 3460.62] completely
[3460.62 → 3462.26] per new roadmap decision
[3462.26 → 3463.30] and enabling the product
[3463.30 → 3464.40] long term once again.
[3464.86 → 3465.94] This may have something
[3465.94 → 3466.86] to do with Intel's
[3466.86 → 3468.04] ongoing struggles
[3468.04 → 3470.66] to produce
[3470.66 → 3472.18] 14 nanometre products.
[3472.72 → 3474.04] It's a dual-core
[3474.04 → 3475.42] G3420
[3475.42 → 3477.08] without hyperthreading
[3477.08 → 3478.12] and it's built
[3478.12 → 3479.76] on the 22 nanometre
[3479.76 → 3480.62] process node.
[3480.86 → 3481.74] It's 53 watts,
[3481.98 → 3482.86] 3.2 gigahertz
[3482.86 → 3483.42] base clock.
[3483.52 → 3483.94] So basically,
[3483.94 → 3484.68] it's fine for like
[3484.68 → 3485.48] an office machine
[3485.48 → 3486.94] and this change
[3486.94 → 3488.12] is likely to benefit
[3488.12 → 3489.20] OEMs only
[3489.20 → 3489.96] producing like
[3489.96 → 3491.04] low cost machines
[3491.04 → 3491.82] en masse.
[3492.22 → 3492.94] With the new update,
[3493.06 → 3493.84] Intel's customers have
[3493.84 → 3494.72] until May 26,
[3494.82 → 3495.26] 2020
[3495.26 → 3496.16] to put in their
[3496.16 → 3496.76] last orders
[3496.76 → 3498.58] for the G3420
[3498.58 → 3499.70] with the last shipments
[3499.70 → 3500.12] going out
[3500.12 → 3501.12] December 3rd
[3501.12 → 3502.44] of next year.
[3502.84 → 3503.70] So this appears
[3503.70 → 3504.52] to be a way
[3504.52 → 3505.08] that Intel
[3505.08 → 3506.02] can harvest
[3506.02 → 3506.86] more of their
[3506.86 → 3507.86] 14 nanometre
[3507.86 → 3509.70] manufacturing capacity
[3509.70 → 3511.30] for higher performance,
[3511.42 → 3512.34] higher margin chips
[3512.34 → 3513.24] and then maybe
[3513.24 → 3513.92] they just had
[3513.92 → 3514.98] some extra fab capacity
[3514.98 → 3516.00] at 22 nanometre
[3516.00 → 3517.20] where they can meet
[3517.20 → 3517.62] some of that
[3517.62 → 3518.64] very high-end demand.
[3519.10 → 3520.58] Freaking hilarious.
[3521.78 → 3524.84] Well, I am so sorry guys
[3524.84 → 3525.94] that today's episode
[3525.94 → 3528.88] was such a complete cluster.
[3529.10 → 3530.08] I apologize for the
[3530.08 → 3530.66] YouTube stream
[3530.66 → 3531.66] cutting out midstream.
[3532.20 → 3533.24] That means that I
[3533.24 → 3534.68] probably don't really
[3534.68 → 3535.74] have any way of
[3535.74 → 3536.76] going back
[3536.76 → 3537.50] and getting all the
[3537.50 → 3538.12] super chats
[3538.12 → 3539.16] but hey,
[3539.22 → 3539.88] you never know.
[3540.08 → 3541.30] Why don't we go through
[3541.30 → 3542.06] some of them together
[3542.06 → 3542.90] here to close out
[3542.90 → 3543.34] the show.
[3545.08 → 3545.80] Dominic says
[3545.80 → 3546.84] stop spamming F.
[3547.46 → 3548.22] Thank you for that
[3548.22 → 3548.82] Dominic.
[3549.52 → 3550.04] Alex,
[3550.18 → 3551.00] send your super chats
[3551.00 → 3551.30] now.
[3551.38 → 3551.82] It will make them
[3551.82 → 3552.82] feel bad for being late.
[3553.56 → 3554.90] I don't even feel bad.
[3555.18 → 3556.08] I tried my
[3556.08 → 3558.36] super absolute best
[3558.36 → 3558.62] today.
[3558.72 → 3559.20] There was nothing
[3559.20 → 3559.98] I could do about it.
[3561.02 → 3561.82] Dominic is now
[3561.82 → 3562.84] a member for the channel.
[3562.98 → 3563.34] Thanks.
[3564.56 → 3565.34] Chelsea says
[3565.34 → 3566.72] rip filthy Frank.
[3566.72 → 3568.72] What?
[3573.02 → 3573.96] What are we talking about?
[3576.40 → 3577.66] Why is everyone saying
[3577.66 → 3578.50] rip filthy Frank
[3578.50 → 3579.54] did he die or something?
[3580.48 → 3581.22] Something.
[3581.44 → 3582.36] No more comedy videos.
[3582.44 → 3582.78] What are you even
[3582.78 → 3583.94] talking about?
[3584.26 → 3585.46] That is so off-topic.
[3588.10 → 3588.58] Alright.
[3589.10 → 3589.98] Dominic spent another
[3589.98 → 3591.72] another two dollars.
[3592.08 → 3592.52] Okay, Dominic.
[3592.58 → 3593.12] I'm not reading
[3593.12 → 3593.84] all you're freaking
[3593.84 → 3594.68] chats here, dude.
[3596.02 → 3596.46] Landon.
[3596.72 → 3597.22] Linus,
[3597.26 → 3597.70] what do you use
[3597.70 → 3598.36] for 2FA?
[3600.36 → 3601.86] I use
[3601.86 → 3603.08] oh man
[3603.08 → 3604.52] I just hate
[3604.52 → 3605.40] talking about this
[3605.40 → 3605.78] stuff
[3605.78 → 3606.86] because like
[3606.86 → 3607.56] honestly
[3607.56 → 3608.36] it was on a
[3608.36 → 3608.76] WEN show
[3608.76 → 3609.62] a long time ago
[3609.62 → 3610.70] I talked a little bit
[3610.70 → 3611.56] about our security
[3611.56 → 3612.24] practices
[3612.24 → 3613.62] and
[3613.62 → 3615.28] the next day
[3615.28 → 3616.52] I had a big problem
[3616.52 → 3617.44] and I'm tired
[3617.44 → 3618.30] of having big problems
[3618.30 → 3619.20] so I'm just gonna
[3619.20 → 3620.06] not talk about it.
[3620.14 → 3620.68] Sorry guys.
[3621.62 → 3622.66] The information's
[3622.66 → 3623.76] out there.
[3625.34 → 3626.18] UCM Rich says
[3626.18 → 3626.64] James rules
[3626.64 → 3627.52] oh, and he missed it.
[3627.74 → 3628.24] He missed it
[3628.24 → 3628.96] because he bailed it.
[3629.06 → 3629.22] Oh.
[3629.38 → 3629.92] I hear you.
[3630.28 → 3631.12] UCM Rich says
[3631.12 → 3632.00] James rules.
[3632.40 → 3633.66] Thanks Rich.
[3634.56 → 3635.30] Spencer says
[3635.30 → 3636.16] you're not live on YouTube.
[3636.28 → 3637.12] Well I am now.
[3637.70 → 3638.66] Maybe I wasn't then.
[3639.26 → 3639.76] Ronnie says
[3639.76 → 3640.38] drop something.
[3640.88 → 3641.58] I'm going to drop
[3641.58 → 3642.50] this stream
[3642.50 → 3643.70] just like I did before.
[3644.38 → 3644.98] Frank says
[3644.98 → 3645.72] will you be contributing
[3645.72 → 3647.22] to Kyle and Paul's charity stream.
[3647.32 → 3648.06] Yeah I guess we could.
[3648.20 → 3648.54] Honestly
[3648.54 → 3650.00] to be perfectly honest
[3650.00 → 3650.40] with you
[3650.40 → 3651.56] I've been so sick
[3651.56 → 3652.30] and so miserable
[3652.30 → 3652.74] this week
[3652.74 → 3653.58] I had not given it
[3653.58 → 3654.24] a moment's thought
[3654.24 → 3655.42] and I only found out
[3655.42 → 3656.06] about the stream
[3656.06 → 3657.98] like two hours ago
[3657.98 → 3659.24] when Paul sent me
[3659.24 → 3659.90] a text message
[3659.90 → 3660.28] and was like
[3660.28 → 3661.02] hey we got a stream
[3661.02 → 3661.52] coming up
[3661.52 → 3662.76] do you want to like
[3662.76 → 3663.60] promote it on your stream
[3663.60 → 3664.12] and I was like
[3664.12 → 3664.72] hell yeah man
[3664.72 → 3665.22] no problem.
[3665.82 → 3666.82] That's how that went down.
[3667.68 → 3668.54] If I remember
[3668.54 → 3669.76] I will go in
[3669.76 → 3670.74] and I will drop
[3670.74 → 3671.48] something on it.
[3672.58 → 3673.28] Marco says
[3673.28 → 3674.32] Apple is overpriced.
[3675.10 → 3676.54] You spent five dollars
[3676.54 → 3677.42] to send that message.
[3677.52 → 3678.04] You want to talk
[3678.04 → 3678.92] overpriced.
[3679.40 → 3680.04] Super chats.
[3682.54 → 3683.58] Vladislav says
[3683.58 → 3684.82] a little wild stream begins.
[3684.96 → 3685.38] Please no.
[3685.50 → 3686.32] Please I need sleep.
[3686.44 → 3687.20] Here we go again.
[3687.58 → 3688.04] Sean says
[3688.04 → 3688.60] you're live now.
[3688.68 → 3689.00] It worked.
[3689.10 → 3689.60] Thanks Sean.
[3692.26 → 3693.34] Pro Yogurt
[3693.34 → 3694.12] to bring something up
[3694.12 → 3694.70] from a month ago
[3694.70 → 3694.96] or so
[3694.96 → 3695.62] the sweatshirt zip
[3695.62 → 3696.34] is on the wrong side.
[3696.40 → 3696.74] You know what
[3696.74 → 3697.92] just because you brought it up
[3697.92 → 3699.02] we are not going to change it.
[3699.32 → 3699.92] That's right.
[3700.74 → 3701.54] Ilya says
[3701.54 → 3703.06] eighth Scrapyard Wars
[3703.06 → 3703.88] was the worst
[3703.88 → 3705.02] and that's not just my opinion.
[3705.16 → 3705.54] Can you address
[3705.54 → 3706.60] why it turned out like that?
[3708.72 → 3709.16] Honestly
[3709.16 → 3710.16] no.
[3711.04 → 3711.48] I mean
[3711.48 → 3712.16] I don't really know
[3712.16 → 3712.92] what to tell you guys.
[3713.00 → 3713.64] We're always trying
[3713.64 → 3714.40] to change it up.
[3715.14 → 3716.50] Sometimes we change it up
[3716.50 → 3717.38] and we try something new
[3717.38 → 3717.96] and it's great.
[3718.44 → 3719.38] Sometimes we change it up
[3719.38 → 3720.14] and try something new
[3720.14 → 3721.40] and you guys don't like it.
[3721.82 → 3722.76] We did our best
[3722.76 → 3723.54] with a concept
[3723.54 → 3725.54] that ultimately
[3725.54 → 3726.84] you know
[3726.84 → 3727.90] the community didn't like
[3727.90 → 3728.72] as much as
[3728.72 → 3729.44] we had hoped
[3729.44 → 3730.96] and if we were to ever
[3730.96 → 3732.02] do Scrapyard Wars again
[3732.02 → 3733.86] we would definitely
[3733.86 → 3734.96] change the concept again
[3734.96 → 3735.66] and maybe you guys
[3735.66 → 3736.10] would love it
[3736.10 → 3736.78] and maybe you guys
[3736.78 → 3737.32] wouldn't love it.
[3737.38 → 3737.84] That's just
[3737.84 → 3739.32] the way it is
[3739.32 → 3740.38] with content like that.
[3740.44 → 3741.48] We can't just keep
[3741.48 → 3742.76] making a $300 computer
[3742.76 → 3743.32] like we did
[3743.32 → 3744.04] in the first one.
[3746.72 → 3747.30] Trenton says
[3747.30 → 3747.70] will there be
[3747.70 → 3748.54] float plane equivalents
[3748.54 → 3749.44] to YouTube chat?
[3750.20 → 3751.58] Probably at some point.
[3751.70 → 3752.26] I mean the idea
[3752.26 → 3753.40] behind the float plane chat
[3753.40 → 3754.04] is that it's kind of
[3754.04 → 3754.82] like all super.
[3754.82 → 3757.50] yeah.
[3759.78 → 3760.58] A lot of people
[3760.58 → 3761.18] in float plane chat
[3761.18 → 3762.02] are saying they liked it
[3762.02 → 3762.40] actually
[3762.40 → 3764.30] so there's that.
[3766.94 → 3767.38] Yeah.
[3767.62 → 3767.92] Alright.
[3768.70 → 3769.80] I will say that
[3769.80 → 3770.58] editing it was
[3770.58 → 3771.88] extraordinarily challenging
[3771.88 → 3772.50] compared to
[3772.50 → 3773.66] extraordinarily challenging
[3773.66 → 3774.40] compared to usual
[3774.40 → 3775.00] because there were
[3775.00 → 3775.72] so many cameras
[3775.72 → 3776.46] so many characters.
[3776.96 → 3777.58] I don't think we would
[3777.58 → 3778.58] ever try to do that again.
[3778.58 → 3782.62] Apple equals
[3782.62 → 3783.26] pop tech garbage.
[3783.38 → 3784.26] Thanks Alex Shannon.
[3784.78 → 3785.32] Gordon Child
[3785.32 → 3787.50] sent a weird emoji.
[3787.62 → 3788.00] I don't even know
[3788.00 → 3788.78] what I'm looking at.
[3790.80 → 3791.46] The Hunt.
[3792.62 → 3793.78] UW Linus.
[3793.86 → 3794.22] I'm going to have to
[3794.22 → 3794.56] look that up
[3794.56 → 3795.40] on Urban Dictionary later.
[3795.52 → 3796.38] First time overclocking
[3796.38 → 3797.22] RAM and timings.
[3797.56 → 3798.16] Any tips?
[3798.52 → 3800.10] Use Ry zen memory calculator.
[3800.22 → 3801.22] Save yourself some hassle.
[3802.90 → 3804.36] Lego lad play well.
[3804.52 → 3805.02] Here's an idea.
[3805.16 → 3805.98] Water cool a PC
[3805.98 → 3807.02] with compressed air.
[3807.02 → 3809.02] That would not be
[3809.02 → 3809.68] water cooling.
[3809.86 → 3810.50] That would be
[3810.50 → 3811.18] air cooling
[3811.18 → 3812.84] but that's cool.
[3814.10 → 3815.36] Hope you get well soon
[3815.36 → 3816.14] says UCM Rich.
[3816.20 → 3816.72] Thank you.
[3817.30 → 3817.82] Nerd Dad.
[3817.92 → 3818.50] After overcoming
[3818.50 → 3819.30] an opioid addiction
[3819.30 → 3820.12] your channel helped me
[3820.12 → 3821.08] rediscover my passion
[3821.08 → 3821.56] for tech.
[3821.82 → 3822.38] Sick dude.
[3822.50 → 3823.02] Love it.
[3824.02 → 3824.80] Michael Parker.
[3824.94 → 3825.52] Thank you.
[3825.96 → 3826.48] Rationalizer.
[3827.70 → 3828.48] MKBHD's thumbnails
[3828.48 → 3829.44] aren't stupid and ugly
[3829.44 → 3830.38] and he does just fine
[3830.38 → 3831.04] with viewer volume.
[3831.44 → 3832.14] Senior explanation
[3832.14 → 3833.16] but still hate them.
[3833.68 → 3834.30] Sleeveless t-shirts
[3834.30 → 3834.80] by the way.
[3835.14 → 3835.64] Aren't those called
[3835.64 → 3836.20] wife beaters?
[3837.02 → 3838.40] I don't know
[3838.40 → 3838.84] if we're planning
[3838.84 → 3839.66] any sleeveless t-shirts
[3839.66 → 3840.42] anytime soon.
[3841.02 → 3841.30] No wait.
[3841.38 → 3841.90] No the beater's
[3841.90 → 3842.68] just a tank top.
[3842.82 → 3843.44] I don't know.
[3843.92 → 3844.96] It's not on the roadmap.
[3845.54 → 3846.88] As for Marquez's thumbnails
[3846.88 → 3847.28] you're right.
[3847.38 → 3848.30] He has a very different
[3848.30 → 3849.02] style from us.
[3849.76 → 3850.80] We've tried that.
[3850.90 → 3851.54] In some cases
[3851.54 → 3852.64] it works really well.
[3852.76 → 3853.92] The phone water cooling
[3853.92 → 3854.76] one was an example
[3854.76 → 3855.66] of sort of more
[3855.66 → 3856.86] clean style thumbnail.
[3859.60 → 3861.04] The reality of it though
[3861.04 → 3862.48] is that it's a much
[3862.48 → 3863.22] longer discussion
[3863.22 → 3864.14] than what I can have
[3864.14 → 3865.04] with you guys right now
[3865.04 → 3866.88] but there are significant
[3866.88 → 3868.02] differences in the way
[3868.02 → 3869.14] that Marquez structures
[3869.14 → 3869.94] his channel and the way
[3869.94 → 3870.84] that we structure ours.
[3871.28 → 3872.60] He's more focused on
[3872.60 → 3873.26] mobile tech.
[3873.36 → 3874.12] Mobile tech and Apple.
[3874.68 → 3876.00] And we are more focused
[3876.00 → 3878.26] on anything with a
[3878.26 → 3879.00] printed circuit board
[3879.00 → 3879.32] in it.
[3879.86 → 3880.90] And for that reason
[3880.90 → 3882.38] we are always going to
[3882.38 → 3883.60] suffer algorithmically
[3883.60 → 3884.80] in ways that he doesn't.
[3885.36 → 3887.72] So his video will get
[3887.72 → 3888.82] promoted very differently
[3888.82 → 3890.06] to a very different sort
[3890.06 → 3891.54] of audience than ours does.
[3891.54 → 3892.82] and what works for one
[3892.82 → 3893.42] audience doesn't
[3893.42 → 3894.68] necessarily work for another.
[3894.82 → 3895.44] With that said
[3895.44 → 3896.70] our click-through rates
[3896.70 → 3898.28] are low compared to
[3898.28 → 3900.18] a cohort of similar
[3900.18 → 3900.54] channels.
[3900.66 → 3901.36] We know this
[3901.36 → 3902.56] but it's really hard
[3902.56 → 3903.32] for us to diagnose
[3903.32 → 3904.32] whether it has purely
[3904.32 → 3905.00] to do with thumbnail
[3905.00 → 3905.46] and title
[3905.46 → 3906.74] or whether it has to do
[3906.74 → 3907.52] with our channel being
[3907.52 → 3908.48] such a variety show.
[3908.66 → 3909.80] The reality of it is
[3909.80 → 3911.82] that someone who's
[3911.82 → 3912.66] interested in a graphics
[3912.66 → 3913.62] card review is not
[3913.62 → 3914.40] necessarily also
[3914.40 → 3915.36] interested in a tour
[3915.36 → 3916.92] of a quantum computer
[3916.92 → 3918.08] chip manufacturer.
[3918.08 → 3920.36] So there you go.
[3920.40 → 3922.12] That's my current response.
[3922.50 → 3923.34] Thanks Alex and Simba.
[3923.42 → 3924.16] Thanks Chandler.
[3925.60 → 3926.00] Wait.
[3926.10 → 3927.26] Can we stop streaming
[3927.26 → 3928.10] Beat Safer on Twitch?
[3928.24 → 3928.44] No.
[3928.50 → 3929.10] I don't plan to stop
[3929.10 → 3929.52] doing that.
[3930.30 → 3930.80] Don Bullock.
[3930.86 → 3931.88] Can we get an
[3931.88 → 3933.82] Gamers 13970X?
[3936.66 → 3937.02] Sorry.
[3937.14 → 3938.58] Which one's 3970X?
[3939.66 → 3940.74] Oh that's the 24 core
[3940.74 → 3941.08] I think.
[3943.30 → 3943.98] We're going to have
[3943.98 → 3944.68] something coming with
[3944.68 → 3945.48] Epic soon.
[3945.98 → 3946.58] So yeah.
[3946.64 → 3947.06] Stay tuned.
[3948.08 → 3951.50] Executive says
[3951.50 → 3952.66] please accept this coupon.
[3953.16 → 3953.80] Thank you for spelling
[3953.80 → 3954.20] it right.
[3954.92 → 3955.84] Towards more collabs
[3955.84 → 3956.34] with Madison.
[3956.52 → 3956.64] Okay.
[3956.74 → 3957.48] No promises.
[3957.66 → 3958.54] No promises guys.
[3960.02 → 3960.74] Michael says
[3960.74 → 3961.30] there are multiple
[3961.30 → 3962.04] after market radios
[3962.04 → 3962.46] with CarPlay.
[3962.54 → 3963.50] Yes we did find one.
[3963.94 → 3964.80] Alex and Simba
[3964.80 → 3965.78] with VR gaining
[3965.78 → 3966.50] a little popularity
[3966.50 → 3967.54] and much more competition
[3967.54 → 3967.92] in the market
[3967.92 → 3968.72] any chance you can do
[3968.72 → 3969.42] an updated wearable
[3969.42 → 3970.14] haptic feedback
[3970.14 → 3971.80] base vest video.
[3972.12 → 3972.54] I don't know.
[3972.62 → 3973.34] Maybe we'll see.
[3974.16 → 3974.78] Sebastian says
[3974.78 → 3975.60] show me your tech tip.
[3975.60 → 3977.88] No wait.
[3977.94 → 3978.38] I can't do that.
[3978.44 → 3979.18] Can't do that on Twitch.
[3979.18 → 3984.00] Ilya is critiquing
[3984.00 → 3985.26] James' choice of watch.
[3985.90 → 3986.96] Doesn't like Daniel Wellington.
[3987.96 → 3988.22] Okay.
[3988.72 → 3989.06] I guess.
[3989.60 → 3990.22] AFA says
[3990.22 → 3990.62] hey James
[3990.62 → 3991.16] just wanted to say
[3991.16 → 3991.48] love you.
[3991.56 → 3992.30] Oh and he's actually
[3992.30 → 3992.96] gone this time.
[3993.54 → 3994.06] Mr. Someone
[3994.06 → 3994.82] love your content.
[3995.06 → 3995.44] What's the best
[3995.44 → 3995.90] surround sound
[3995.90 → 3996.50] gaming headset?
[3996.50 → 3998.78] A headphone.
[3999.08 → 4000.26] A pair of good headphones.
[4000.98 → 4001.96] Don't buy the ones
[4001.96 → 4002.52] with like
[4002.52 → 4004.46] multiple drivers in them.
[4004.86 → 4005.54] We did a video
[4005.54 → 4006.30] a little while ago
[4006.30 → 4008.06] our surround headphones
[4008.06 → 4009.46] BS Anthony worked on it
[4009.46 → 4010.64] that kind of goes through
[4010.64 → 4011.52] all the different options.
[4012.98 → 4013.68] Curzon says
[4013.68 → 4014.20] have you considered
[4014.20 → 4014.66] doing a video
[4014.66 → 4015.10] on the absolute
[4015.10 → 4016.02] most powerful PC
[4016.02 → 4016.78] ever that's stable
[4016.78 → 4017.34] and is workable
[4017.34 → 4018.06] for gaming and editing?
[4018.76 → 4019.76] Actually we have
[4019.76 → 4021.02] Compensator 3
[4021.02 → 4021.90] coming soon.
[4022.44 → 4023.84] Jake is working on it.
[4023.84 → 4026.98] Quintuple says
[4026.98 → 4027.50] you should have used
[4027.50 → 4028.18] white Hydro Dip
[4028.18 → 4029.06] on the graphics card
[4029.06 → 4030.44] on the latest clean build.
[4030.68 → 4031.42] We totally should have
[4031.42 → 4031.66] done that.
[4031.74 → 4032.40] That would have been awesome.
[4033.22 → 4034.28] And thanks for the
[4034.28 → 4035.34] kudos on the new office.
[4035.46 → 4036.28] I'll let Yvonne know.
[4037.40 → 4038.06] Hal says
[4038.06 → 4039.06] take some sick time.
[4039.62 → 4040.08] Well you're
[4040.08 → 4041.40] you're working against me Hal.
[4041.60 → 4042.16] You're making me
[4042.16 → 4043.04] read your super chat.
[4043.20 → 4043.72] I'm trying to read
[4043.72 → 4044.34] all the super chats.
[4044.40 → 4045.08] I'm trying to be nice.
[4045.56 → 4046.62] Nurser asked for my opinion
[4046.62 → 4048.24] on YouTube Rewind 2019.
[4048.82 → 4050.14] I think it was the safest
[4050.14 → 4051.62] possible approach
[4051.62 → 4052.34] they could have taken.
[4052.34 → 4054.40] I got bored
[4054.40 → 4054.92] like
[4054.92 → 4056.04] I don't know
[4056.04 → 4056.72] a minute and a half
[4056.72 → 4057.34] two minutes in
[4057.34 → 4058.06] and I tuned out.
[4058.30 → 4059.14] I don't know what else
[4059.14 → 4059.90] they would have done though
[4059.90 → 4060.64] after the cluster
[4060.64 → 4061.50] that was last year.
[4062.92 → 4063.98] I know there's people
[4063.98 → 4064.86] internally there
[4064.86 → 4065.94] that just want to kill it.
[4066.22 → 4066.86] I think they should
[4066.86 → 4067.44] just kill it.
[4068.04 → 4068.78] Just let YouTubers
[4068.78 → 4069.94] make their own rewinds.
[4069.98 → 4070.76] Marquez made a rewind.
[4070.88 → 4071.56] There are other tech guys
[4071.56 → 4072.30] that made rewinds.
[4072.56 → 4073.70] We actually wrote down
[4073.70 → 4074.48] we should do a rewind
[4074.48 → 4075.02] in 2019
[4075.02 → 4076.12] after last year
[4076.12 → 4077.04] and then we just
[4077.04 → 4077.86] like didn't do it.
[4078.08 → 4078.86] But that's fine.
[4078.94 → 4080.14] I contributed to Marquez's
[4080.14 → 4081.24] so at least there's that.
[4082.34 → 4087.08] Tommy Gunn says
[4087.08 → 4089.20] thanks to your speed build vid
[4089.20 → 4090.70] I knew that the MSI
[4090.70 → 4092.20] Venus 2080 Ti
[4092.20 → 4093.66] has a Founders Edition PCB.
[4093.88 → 4094.76] I was able to get a sick deal
[4094.76 → 4095.30] and a used one
[4095.30 → 4096.38] for my water cooled rig.
[4096.78 → 4097.14] Sweet.
[4097.62 → 4098.30] Sebastian says
[4098.30 → 4098.96] when will you release
[4098.96 → 4100.26] the jacket from the trees video?
[4100.62 → 4101.52] There are no plans
[4101.52 → 4102.46] to release that jacket.
[4102.88 → 4103.74] We had that done
[4103.74 → 4105.18] as a custom jacket
[4105.18 → 4106.94] that is LMG staff only.
[4106.94 → 4108.34] So if you look closely
[4108.34 → 4109.38] whenever you see an LMG
[4109.38 → 4110.04] or wearing it
[4110.04 → 4111.02] on the sleeve
[4111.02 → 4112.08] is a number.
[4113.08 → 4116.06] That's not a prison number.
[4116.60 → 4118.26] It's actually their subscriber number.
[4118.66 → 4119.42] So everyone
[4119.42 → 4121.54] at last year's Christmas party
[4121.54 → 4123.84] who got one of those jackets
[4123.84 → 4125.40] has the number of subscribers
[4125.40 → 4126.52] that the LTT channel
[4126.52 → 4127.80] had on their hire date
[4127.80 → 4129.64] embroidered on their jacket.
[4129.64 → 4131.34] So it was just kind of like
[4131.34 → 4133.94] like a fun, cool
[4133.94 → 4136.02] commemorative item
[4136.02 → 4137.44] for us to celebrate
[4137.44 → 4138.32] the milestones
[4138.32 → 4139.06] that we've hit
[4139.06 → 4140.10] since we've been working together.
[4141.84 → 4143.12] What else we got here?
[4143.68 → 4144.26] Aiden says
[4144.26 → 4144.70] friend of mine
[4144.70 → 4145.60] turned me on to your channel.
[4145.86 → 4146.14] Sick.
[4146.28 → 4146.70] Love it.
[4147.06 → 4148.14] Building his own PC now.
[4148.56 → 4149.36] David says
[4149.36 → 4150.88] any thoughts on
[4150.88 → 4152.18] Akbukuku's
[4152.18 → 4153.06] changing the channel name
[4153.06 → 4153.82] to Tech Tangents?
[4154.36 → 4155.46] Totally good move.
[4155.86 → 4156.46] Love it.
[4156.70 → 4157.68] Totally the right move.
[4157.82 → 4158.98] It was overdue.
[4159.64 → 4160.66] Mr. Someone
[4160.66 → 4161.12] when do you think
[4161.12 → 4161.96] the RGB trend will die?
[4162.08 → 4162.32] Never.
[4163.36 → 4163.86] Glenn.
[4164.32 → 4164.64] Linus
[4164.64 → 4165.42] why does your voice sound off?
[4165.52 → 4166.08] I'm sick.
[4166.48 → 4167.02] Thanks Joseph.
[4167.36 → 4168.28] Thanks Salty Nuts.
[4168.90 → 4169.32] Two more.
[4169.46 → 4169.86] Two more.
[4170.38 → 4171.44] Jason Meredith says
[4171.44 → 4171.92] just want to hear
[4171.92 → 4172.72] how you pronounce my name.
[4172.88 → 4173.44] It's easy.
[4174.00 → 4174.64] Jason Meredith.
[4174.96 → 4175.78] Your name is Jason.
[4176.40 → 4177.44] It's not even spelled weird.
[4177.74 → 4178.54] K-A-S-O-N.
[4178.78 → 4179.52] What are you talking about?
[4180.28 → 4181.22] Robert Males says
[4181.22 → 4182.56] join the LTT Minecraft server
[4182.56 → 4183.72] MC.leg.GG
[4183.72 → 4185.18] Jake has been sidelined
[4185.18 → 4186.38] for like a month
[4186.38 → 4187.30] working on this project
[4187.30 → 4188.76] but I'm really excited about it.
[4188.78 → 4189.48] It's going to be sick.
[4189.64 → 4192.22] There will be
[4192.22 → 4193.56] donations and transactions
[4193.56 → 4194.30] but we're going to try
[4194.30 → 4195.66] and make it not lame
[4195.66 → 4197.52] because obviously
[4197.52 → 4198.66] our primary revenue stream
[4198.66 → 4199.66] is still YouTube videos
[4199.66 → 4201.14] but with how much time
[4201.14 → 4201.94] Jake has been
[4201.94 → 4203.10] and will be spending on it
[4203.10 → 4203.96] and like
[4203.96 → 4205.14] how much
[4205.14 → 4206.74] server infrastructure
[4206.74 → 4207.64] we're buying
[4207.64 → 4208.52] and leasing and stuff
[4208.52 → 4209.90] it's not going to be free.
[4210.00 → 4210.64] I will say that.
[4210.88 → 4211.54] Well it'll be free
[4211.54 → 4212.28] but like
[4212.28 → 4213.76] there will be ways
[4213.76 → 4215.46] to help support the servers.
[4215.46 → 4217.92] Any updates on the
[4217.92 → 4218.78] Float plane iOS app?
[4218.84 → 4219.86] I'd love to have one too
[4219.86 → 4220.80] but Luke's not in today.
[4221.90 → 4223.36] Any updates on PIA sponsorship?
[4223.58 → 4224.48] I believe they are planning
[4224.48 → 4225.90] to join us on the WAN show
[4225.90 → 4227.22] sometime in the next couple of weeks.
[4227.60 → 4228.42] Stay tuned for that.
[4230.32 → 4230.76] Alright.
[4231.32 → 4232.56] Thanks for tuning in guys.
[4232.76 → 4233.78] See you again next week.
[4234.62 → 4235.30] Same bad time,
[4235.40 → 4236.08] same bad channel.
[4236.08 → 4238.60] And my voice is dead.
[4238.60 → 4239.16] Bye.
