[0.00 → 0.36] Yeah!
[1.28 → 1.92] Heck yeah.
[1.92 → 2.36] We're live.
[2.70 → 4.36] So, you got a haircut.
[4.80 → 5.14] I did.
[5.76 → 11.38] And I heard a little story about how that whole experience went down that I thought was pretty funny,
[11.48 → 15.10] and I think I'm going to share with the many thousands of people who watch this show.
[15.54 → 16.18] How did it go down?
[16.72 → 24.64] Is it true that you basically brought a picture of Chris Evans to the barber and said like this?
[25.04 → 25.34] Yeah.
[26.64 → 28.02] You didn't know that was a thing?
[28.02 → 30.88] No, I mean, I do know that's a thing.
[31.02 → 38.94] I just, I have a hard time picturing, you know, you being as like the guy who's like,
[39.66 → 43.30] this is the celebrity that I want my hair to look most like.
[43.84 → 45.26] Or sorry, was it Chris Evans?
[45.78 → 48.20] It was, I'm pretty sure that's his name.
[48.42 → 49.20] Captain America.
[49.20 → 49.60] It's Captain America.
[49.74 → 50.32] Yeah, okay.
[53.56 → 54.62] So I watched.
[54.80 → 55.90] So happy right now.
[56.70 → 57.76] Oh, I have sound on.
[58.02 → 60.30] I watched Captain America Winter Soldier.
[60.78 → 61.02] Yeah.
[61.12 → 63.60] And I was like, that man has got it going on.
[64.54 → 66.08] I want my hair to look like that.
[66.46 → 72.12] And I went to the hairdresser, and we had a little bit of a language barrier.
[72.80 → 73.20] Sure.
[73.44 → 76.08] So I was trying to describe his hair, and it wasn't working.
[76.40 → 78.72] And then after a bit I was just like, just give me like one moment.
[78.82 → 80.14] And I picked up my phone, and I was like, just give me.
[80.22 → 80.92] And she's like, okay.
[80.92 → 84.32] And I just looked up Captain America Winter Soldier and was like this.
[84.48 → 85.22] And she was like, okay.
[85.34 → 87.12] And it didn't end up really looking like that.
[87.60 → 90.24] I was not going to say anything.
[90.70 → 90.88] Yeah.
[90.98 → 91.66] No, not at all.
[91.88 → 94.70] But like, I was like, okay, that actually looks pretty all right though.
[94.78 → 96.16] And then I had my own thing.
[96.20 → 97.20] It didn't end up really looking like that.
[97.20 → 98.40] Okay.
[98.62 → 98.98] Okay.
[99.08 → 99.70] You know what?
[99.86 → 101.38] That's fine.
[101.44 → 101.90] That's great.
[103.42 → 104.18] So, okay.
[104.24 → 106.36] You got to tell me how premeditated was this?
[106.72 → 111.14] Like, have you been growing into like Scraggly Man over the last little bit?
[111.64 → 119.52] Because the intention was to start with a larger block of clay from which to sculpt Captain America?
[119.78 → 120.58] Like, was that the plan?
[120.90 → 121.24] So, okay.
[121.28 → 122.22] You don't really know the story.
[122.34 → 125.48] Here, because I'm going to get even more personal here.
[125.48 → 128.66] Because you also like to put on a bunch of weight.
[129.18 → 129.40] Yes.
[129.44 → 130.44] Was that the same plan?
[130.64 → 134.48] So, you could sell Captain America from...
[134.48 → 138.90] Yeah, that's absolutely.
[139.00 → 140.36] So, is there some truth to...
[140.36 → 141.22] Because, okay, look.
[141.34 → 145.34] Like, he actually is far more serious about working out than I am.
[145.46 → 147.32] And the weight that he had on...
[147.32 → 149.82] Now, this is not necessarily true like three years ago.
[149.96 → 155.30] But the weight that he had on like six to 12 months ago, I can make fun of him about because it was intentional.
[155.48 → 157.20] So, you were going for full beefcake.
[157.32 → 157.56] Yes.
[157.66 → 164.94] So, is it easier to build big muscles by building just a bunch of weight first and then converting it?
[165.36 → 165.98] Well, you...
[165.98 → 166.80] Do I understand this correctly?
[166.90 → 167.72] You do them both.
[167.90 → 172.56] So, you eat an excess while working out a ton, and you build a lot of muscle during that time.
[172.66 → 172.98] Okay.
[172.98 → 179.12] And then you cut down the fat and probably a little bit of muscle, but you try to retain as much muscle as you can.
[179.20 → 179.40] Got it.
[179.48 → 180.02] See, all...
[180.02 → 182.64] You don't then reverse it to turn it into...
[182.64 → 182.88] Yeah.
[183.14 → 184.62] You build up the muscle at the same time.
[184.62 → 184.92] Got it.
[185.16 → 185.82] That's why...
[185.82 → 187.32] Remember I was doing those like crazy leg press?
[187.36 → 187.96] Yes, yes, yeah.
[187.96 → 188.30] Yeah.
[188.36 → 190.20] That was when I was at my heaviest weight.
[190.32 → 190.58] Okay.
[190.80 → 194.10] So, back to the premeditation of the Chris Evans haircut.
[194.10 → 194.54] Okay.
[194.54 → 194.60] Okay.
[194.60 → 195.82] So, you don't know the actual story then?
[195.88 → 199.00] Because the Chris Evans haircut was like 2014.
[200.06 → 200.50] Okay.
[201.06 → 202.50] This one was not a Chris...
[202.50 → 203.52] I brought my own picture.
[204.36 → 205.86] I showed her a picture of me.
[205.86 → 207.96] You brought your own picture of your previous Chris Evans haircut?
[208.12 → 208.44] Yeah.
[210.30 → 210.74] Okay.
[210.74 → 212.58] Well, I think I found your problem.
[215.18 → 216.58] Why would you do that?
[216.84 → 217.18] No.
[217.34 → 219.54] I mean, I think it looks fine right now.
[219.56 → 219.78] Oh, yeah.
[219.80 → 220.32] It looks fine.
[220.38 → 220.54] Yeah.
[220.64 → 222.24] It just doesn't look like Captain America.
[222.36 → 222.66] No.
[222.66 → 224.70] But I gave up on that.
[224.78 → 225.18] I don't mind.
[225.30 → 226.26] I don't care about that anymore.
[226.42 → 226.68] Okay.
[226.72 → 227.68] I just wanted what I had before.
[227.88 → 231.02] This whole idea was I'm not on camera as much anymore.
[231.32 → 231.60] Right.
[231.70 → 234.08] So, I was like I'm finally going to do something I've wanted to do for a while.
[234.14 → 234.42] Okay.
[234.56 → 236.90] Which was I wanted to get Viking beard, Viking hair.
[237.62 → 238.02] Oh.
[238.12 → 239.12] So, more Chris Hemsworth.
[239.82 → 240.28] I guess.
[240.30 → 240.68] That's Thor.
[241.02 → 241.36] Yeah.
[241.60 → 243.90] We're going to bring everything back to Marvel characters.
[243.90 → 244.30] To Chris.
[244.56 → 244.74] Yeah.
[244.92 → 245.66] To Chris and Marvel.
[245.66 → 247.04] Marvel characters named Chris.
[247.04 → 247.48] Yeah.
[248.94 → 249.30] Yeah.
[249.42 → 251.16] So, I guess that was more the idea.
[251.64 → 252.04] And then...
[252.04 → 252.24] Sure.
[253.34 → 256.26] As of nourish, I'm like, nah.
[256.82 → 257.90] It's not working.
[258.08 → 258.22] Okay.
[258.24 → 259.58] So, this is probably going to go way too.
[259.94 → 260.36] Really?
[260.46 → 260.84] Probably.
[261.04 → 262.42] You're going to ditch the beard?
[262.60 → 264.32] You're not going to go like Keto stash, are you?
[264.38 → 264.62] No, no, no, no.
[264.98 → 269.66] It would like trimming back down to what it was more like when I had hair more like this.
[270.00 → 270.64] Got it.
[270.66 → 270.96] Okay.
[270.96 → 271.16] Okay.
[271.16 → 273.00] So, like the stubble kind of style.
[273.18 → 273.64] Got it.
[273.68 → 274.18] Got it.
[274.26 → 274.62] Okay.
[274.74 → 275.16] All right.
[275.16 → 276.16] So, um...
[276.16 → 279.06] Like you've had five o'clock shadows for three days kind of stuff.
[279.06 → 284.16] I mean, the thing with you is like you don't really need to make your chin line like stronger.
[284.54 → 285.24] Like, um...
[285.24 → 286.06] It's, uh...
[286.06 → 286.22] Hmm.
[286.26 → 287.52] How do I say this tactfully?
[287.52 → 289.70] Uh, when Colton shaves his beard...
[289.70 → 289.98] Whoa!
[293.30 → 294.54] How do I say this tactfully?
[294.94 → 295.38] Name!
[297.38 → 299.52] It's, it's not that, um...
[299.52 → 300.16] Oh, jeez.
[300.20 → 300.54] Okay.
[300.60 → 302.52] It's not that, um...
[302.52 → 305.18] It makes it look like he has a weak chin.
[305.42 → 310.68] It's just that his beard makes his jawline and chin look stronger.
[310.90 → 311.22] Okay.
[311.54 → 311.88] Yeah.
[312.00 → 312.38] Yeah.
[312.38 → 314.36] I think mine almost does the opposite effect.
[314.74 → 316.70] Because the hair's like round around it.
[317.04 → 317.16] Yeah.
[317.16 → 318.08] And I curl around.
[318.28 → 318.56] Yeah.
[318.72 → 319.32] So, I...
[319.32 → 323.84] My biggest problem has been that it likes to go in.
[323.98 → 324.26] Yeah.
[324.40 → 325.66] So, it's not coming down.
[325.66 → 326.04] Neck beard.
[326.46 → 326.70] Yeah.
[326.90 → 327.72] Neck beard man.
[327.84 → 328.06] Yeah.
[328.22 → 329.20] That's the haircut.
[329.24 → 331.36] Even if I shave all the way up to...
[331.36 → 332.40] Well, actually, though.
[332.40 → 333.74] Is neck beard man a thing?
[334.06 → 335.96] It's like a superhero called neck beard man.
[335.98 → 336.14] It has to be a thing.
[337.26 → 338.90] There's the fedora guy.
[339.82 → 341.66] There's the like, fedora guy meme.
[342.00 → 343.02] Oh, that guy.
[343.10 → 343.44] Yeah, no.
[343.66 → 343.82] Yeah.
[344.14 → 344.72] Uh, which one?
[344.76 → 345.28] This guy?
[345.32 → 345.54] Yeah.
[345.54 → 347.74] That's a famous, like, meme picture.
[348.16 → 348.54] Okay.
[348.78 → 348.94] All right.
[348.94 → 349.74] So is that one.
[349.82 → 350.86] But this one's like...
[350.86 → 352.14] Yeah, but these are just...
[352.14 → 353.30] This is neck beard guy.
[353.30 → 355.40] These are just, like, men with neck beard.
[355.50 → 358.22] These are not, like, neck beard man to the rescue!
[358.22 → 358.60] Yes.
[358.60 → 358.92] Yeah.
[358.92 → 359.66] You know?
[359.82 → 359.96] Yeah.
[360.36 → 360.78] That's true.
[361.34 → 362.32] Which I think...
[362.32 → 364.24] I think could...
[364.24 → 365.94] Could be very...
[365.94 → 366.64] Could be done.
[367.28 → 367.66] Yeah.
[368.54 → 370.14] I mean, so we actually...
[370.14 → 371.20] So we're in the book you're writing?
[371.86 → 372.24] I just...
[372.24 → 372.40] Okay.
[372.48 → 373.20] I actually...
[373.20 → 374.06] I wrote a few things.
[374.30 → 374.62] Really?
[374.76 → 375.20] I did.
[375.42 → 375.84] I did.
[376.30 → 377.16] I'm not gonna...
[377.16 → 378.64] I'm not going to bring them up on screen.
[378.88 → 379.16] Okay.
[379.32 → 380.92] But I think...
[381.68 → 382.28] I...
[382.28 → 383.14] Can I help you, Brandon?
[383.26 → 383.64] No, it's fine.
[383.86 → 384.20] Oh, okay.
[384.26 → 385.02] Are we beautiful?
[385.26 → 385.52] Yeah.
[385.86 → 386.44] How's your back?
[387.04 → 387.56] Slightly better.
[387.56 → 388.10] Oh, okay.
[388.26 → 388.54] That's good.
[388.54 → 388.78] Look at that.
[389.02 → 389.78] Oh, jeez.
[392.04 → 396.96] So I actually haven't decided whether to include any of this, but I did write a few things down.
[397.08 → 399.52] I have a thought for my foreword, okay?
[399.66 → 399.90] Okay.
[400.34 → 407.16] If I was a total sellout, I'd have structured this book as an inspirational story about how anyone can do it if they try hard enough,
[407.32 → 410.36] and a collection of tips to help you achieve what I've achieved.
[410.52 → 410.72] Yeah.
[412.42 → 413.78] But then...
[413.78 → 415.66] If I wasn't...
[415.66 → 416.32] What did I say?
[416.32 → 416.72] Okay.
[417.06 → 420.42] But then if I wasn't interested in making money, I wouldn't bother writing a book at all.
[420.48 → 422.62] It's a pretty transparent cash grab from my perspective.
[424.06 → 427.92] So this is the level of honesty that we're going for here.
[428.00 → 428.36] I like it.
[428.36 → 434.98] I don't know if I'll include that, but I think it's pretty funny.
[435.22 → 437.18] Those two points actually were not related.
[437.28 → 439.16] They just ended up in the same paragraph for no reason.
[439.62 → 441.06] That's why they don't really flow very well.
[441.14 → 441.58] Look, look.
[441.64 → 444.42] We're talking like a couple of words on a page.
[444.52 → 446.92] We're not talking even draft stages right now.
[447.14 → 447.28] Yeah.
[447.28 → 451.80] But I guess what I would want it to be is something honest.
[452.80 → 458.22] I wouldn't want it to be like, you know, Disney princess story.
[458.48 → 458.50] Yeah.
[458.50 → 461.12] You know, anyone can make it.
[461.12 → 470.04] Because the cold hard truth, if I'm being honest with everyone, including myself, is that in the current climate, I don't know if I would have made it.
[470.04 → 480.46] And clearly, I had the stuff to make it if the time was exactly right and the circumstances were exactly right.
[480.92 → 494.20] I firmly believe that any amount of success is some proportion, and I couldn't tell you exactly what it is, but some proportion skill and another very important proportion luck, right place, right time.
[494.24 → 496.32] But like effectively everything in life is that.
[496.50 → 497.38] Yes, of course.
[497.38 → 501.56] I mean, with luck any worse, I could have been hit by a bus when I was six.
[501.82 → 501.98] Right.
[502.40 → 502.76] Yeah.
[502.90 → 503.58] You never know.
[503.74 → 503.90] Yeah.
[504.80 → 508.76] You know, that dent in my head could have gone all the way through and killed me, you know.
[510.20 → 512.10] And there's crazy stuff like that the whole way through.
[512.26 → 515.28] I think for me, I don't know if this is true for the audience or not.
[515.28 → 516.44] You could have died a lot of times.
[516.70 → 516.96] Oh, yeah.
[517.24 → 517.60] Oh, yeah.
[517.76 → 518.12] Oh, yeah.
[518.48 → 520.00] I've been hit by cars multiple times.
[520.08 → 520.28] Yeah.
[520.36 → 521.10] Like actually.
[521.28 → 521.46] Yeah.
[521.46 → 521.90] Like, yeah.
[523.14 → 526.88] Like, was it your first WAN show when you were like in a sling from getting hit by a car?
[527.02 → 527.28] Yes.
[527.48 → 527.72] Yeah.
[528.22 → 529.06] That was a thing.
[529.18 → 529.36] Yeah.
[530.42 → 531.28] What was I going to say?
[531.58 → 535.56] For me, I think it would be genuinely a lot more interesting to hear about the hardships.
[536.18 → 536.50] Right.
[537.32 → 539.50] I probably know about a fair amount of them.
[539.62 → 544.66] But like, I feel like as a reader, if they care, they're going to be more interested in that.
[544.66 → 547.36] I think I feel like writing a self-help book.
[547.36 → 551.68] Like, I'm 100% certain you could.
[551.82 → 553.26] And I think you'd be great.
[553.48 → 555.72] But I don't think it's the best thing you could do.
[555.78 → 558.50] I also think I could become like a televangelist.
[558.96 → 560.40] I think I'd be excellent at it.
[560.40 → 561.38] I'm sure you could.
[561.38 → 566.14] That doesn't mean that I think those people should have the jets that they fly.
[566.42 → 566.66] Yeah.
[566.76 → 572.10] Or that I think that there's any moral ground to stand on for.
[572.54 → 577.54] And I'm not going to say all of them because maybe there's an exceptional one.
[577.54 → 578.86] Yeah, sure.
[579.24 → 581.54] But, you know, the entire...
[582.22 → 586.80] And I'm not getting into my religious views here because it actually doesn't matter.
[587.14 → 589.78] I could be Buddhist, atheist, Christian.
[590.12 → 592.04] Like, it actually just really doesn't matter.
[592.34 → 595.36] I have enough knowledge of Christianity, I will say that much,
[595.64 → 600.98] to know that the whole plant a seed of money in hopes that it will come back to you think
[600.98 → 602.62] is nothing but horse shit.
[602.62 → 608.62] And it was never endorsed by any figure in...
[609.48 → 611.94] Like, you can go looking hard enough in the Bible,
[611.94 → 614.62] and you can find validation for pretty much anything.
[614.74 → 618.46] It's like, oh, here's these four words taken entirely out of context
[618.46 → 620.64] that appear to back up the argument I'm trying to make.
[622.46 → 625.42] Yeah, that's a bad scene.
[625.54 → 626.36] It's a bad thing to do.
[626.62 → 628.60] But I forget where we were going with this.
[628.78 → 631.06] Oh, yeah, I could write a self-help book, and it would probably be good.
[631.06 → 637.08] But I'm a bit of a cynic, and I take kind of a cynical approach to self-help books.
[637.16 → 640.76] I think that the most helpful thing you can do for yourself is go out and start helping yourself.
[641.98 → 644.38] Then again, there's a lot of people that have said, you know,
[644.42 → 646.54] I read Seven Habits for Highly Effective People,
[646.68 → 648.50] or I read How to Make Friends and Influence People,
[648.60 → 649.46] or I read this, or I read that.
[649.52 → 652.68] I haven't read any of them, so I can't specifically endorse any of them.
[653.00 → 655.38] But it makes sense to change your life.
[655.90 → 656.46] Yeah, yeah.
[656.70 → 658.48] An interesting observation I've had about those things.
[658.48 → 664.20] Sometimes you'll hear something a million times from your parents or your friends or your partner or something,
[664.38 → 669.60] and you brush it off, and then you read it on some random book by someone who you're supposed to listen to,
[669.66 → 671.52] and you're like, oh, my goodness, it's so profound.
[671.80 → 674.14] And it's the same damn thing you've heard three million times.
[674.44 → 674.64] Yeah.
[674.74 → 677.02] Like, actually show up to work and stuff like that.
[677.02 → 681.82] Which is like, hey, which seems to be a problem in some cases.
[682.60 → 686.38] Don't buy that crazy expensive car when you shouldn't.
[687.04 → 690.92] And then you read a self-help finance book, and it's like, hey, don't buy that super expensive car.
[690.98 → 693.60] And you're like, whoa, I never thought about that.
[693.84 → 694.42] Like, I don't know.
[694.58 → 698.56] So sometimes people might just need that little extra kick, but who knows.
[699.46 → 701.92] So those are all, only you have those.
[702.06 → 702.82] Did this turn off?
[703.72 → 704.44] Are we dead?
[704.58 → 705.00] Are we down?
[705.14 → 705.94] Oh, no, we're up on you.
[706.00 → 706.62] Oh, wait, we're back.
[706.72 → 707.92] Okay, I don't know what just happened there.
[708.66 → 709.44] Okay, anyway.
[711.74 → 713.74] What are we even talking about today?
[713.86 → 714.72] There's some weird news.
[714.80 → 715.74] It's not amazing news.
[715.74 → 716.44] Oh, right.
[716.54 → 717.06] We're hiring.
[717.62 → 717.94] Yeah.
[718.26 → 719.38] Everyone is hiring.
[719.66 → 719.82] Yep.
[719.82 → 728.54] We are actually hiring a total of somewhere between six and more positions.
[728.56 → 730.44] It's like almost every department at both companies.
[730.94 → 731.24] Yeah.
[731.38 → 737.42] So there's going to be a dedicated video over on the Linus Tech Tips channel because this is a pretty big wave.
[737.60 → 739.66] But we're hiring between one and two writers.
[739.98 → 741.02] We're hiring a grip.
[741.24 → 744.34] We're hiring two shooters slash editors.
[744.68 → 746.20] So that's the LMG side.
[747.00 → 747.98] You're hiring.
[747.98 → 757.86] An infrastructure DevOps person who specializes more on the development side, like building automation tools for the infrastructure team, and a generalized JavaScript developer.
[758.54 → 776.90] And then, in addition to that, and actually Sancho is a perfect place to discuss this, LMG is in a really unusual, sort of new and exciting position where we have an opportunity right now to invest in something totally new and different.
[777.98 → 790.54] Where if someone were to come to me, like some punk channel with, you know, 62 subscribers or whatever else, where they have like what they think is a really amazing concept.
[790.54 → 802.74] But, you know, like I was alluding to before, in the current climate, for whatever reason, they are finding it challenging to break out.
[802.96 → 806.24] Because it's so hard to break out on YouTube.
[806.60 → 806.74] Yeah.
[806.88 → 808.18] You've got to convince the audience.
[808.40 → 810.04] You've got to convince other creators.
[810.04 → 814.92] Like if you want to collab to try to grow faster, you've got to convince the algorithm, the almighty algorithm.
[814.94 → 815.70] Oh, gee.
[816.52 → 817.40] Praise the algorithm.
[817.50 → 817.90] Oh, no, no.
[817.90 → 821.60] You know, you've got to do all these things.
[821.72 → 827.74] And so if someone felt like they're really onto something, we would be, wait for the're hiring video.
[827.82 → 829.66] Don't just like start messaging me on Twitter.
[829.90 → 830.06] Yeah.
[830.06 → 835.62] But we would be quite interested in hearing from you and trying something totally different.
[835.62 → 841.16] Because as you might imagine, there's a lot of people in this building that have passions that extend beyond technology.
[841.74 → 845.88] You know, James was trying to pitch me doing a documentary.
[847.06 → 853.78] You know, Brandon has wanted to do more shorts and even a feature at some point since before I hired him.
[853.78 → 857.28] He also wants to do more commercial work.
[858.00 → 864.40] Just trying to think of like individual people who have like particular things they want to work on.
[864.60 → 870.02] Like, you know, I've wanted to do like a perfect toy channel since, well, before Channel Super Fun.
[870.18 → 870.26] Yeah.
[870.44 → 873.10] And Channel Super Fun morphed into not a toy channel.
[873.28 → 879.64] But, you know, maybe there's the potential to bring back that original concept and turn it into something new.
[879.64 → 892.52] So, you know, Colton is actively pursuing actually right now more of like an agency role for Linus Media Group where we will take on, in fact, one of our clients is sitting right here.
[893.14 → 899.80] So where we'll take on smaller influencers and broker deals for them with larger brands.
[900.44 → 907.78] And we actually did something with Luke, who, as you guys know, doesn't work for Linus Media Group anymore, where he went to PAX East, was it?
[907.78 → 910.00] Twitch Con?
[910.64 → 911.04] Something.
[911.26 → 911.50] Whatever.
[912.98 → 914.34] I should probably know this.
[915.74 → 917.08] Where was I?
[917.66 → 918.88] I think it was Twitch Con.
[919.00 → 920.28] What was I doing there?
[921.36 → 922.54] I think it was Twitch Con.
[922.64 → 922.80] Yeah.
[923.34 → 925.88] So that's something that we're exploring.
[925.88 → 936.66] So we're just, we're at sort of this bizarre point where I find myself for the first time since starting this company kind of paralyzed.
[937.34 → 939.50] Like paralyzed by choices.
[940.64 → 947.62] Because we can do anything, but not everything.
[947.62 → 951.26] So we have to make the right choice.
[952.32 → 961.48] Because we're still a small company in that we can't just go like, oh, let's start 20 new YouTube channels and let's...
[962.58 → 963.72] Which never really works out anyway.
[963.72 → 970.90] Let's start building, you know, six different, you know, physical products and see which ones come to fruition.
[971.10 → 973.50] Like, that's not really our jam.
[973.60 → 977.54] We're more about sort of doing a few things and doing them as well as we possibly can.
[977.80 → 977.90] Yeah.
[978.68 → 984.50] I mean, LTX is another thing that's sort of like going crazy right now.
[985.68 → 987.46] And, oh, by the way, we ran the numbers.
[987.66 → 991.78] You know that stupid spitball number that I threw out last week, quarter million dollars?
[991.78 → 993.48] It actually is like really close.
[993.72 → 994.12] Oh, wow.
[994.32 → 996.78] Yeah, that's about how much it's going to cost us.
[997.82 → 1000.42] Now, the good news is we ran other numbers.
[1000.74 → 1005.02] And if everything goes absolutely perfectly, there is a chance we'll break even.
[1006.12 → 1006.56] Okay.
[1007.38 → 1008.54] So that's neat.
[1009.42 → 1011.00] That was exciting.
[1011.44 → 1017.14] So I suspect there will be some additional costs, and we'll just be like a little bit below instead of a lot below.
[1017.22 → 1021.18] Yeah, which honestly is like the perfect place to be for me.
[1021.18 → 1025.54] Like we throw a great big party for all of our supporters and have a bunch of fun.
[1026.36 → 1031.26] And, you know, like Corsair pays for it, you know, like that kind of thing.
[1033.44 → 1036.30] To be clear, we actually don't know for sure if Corsair is coming.
[1036.44 → 1045.68] I was supposed to have a blog post for you guys this week that was going to be brands that have either expressed interest or like are pretty much coming for sure.
[1045.68 → 1049.48] But we don't want to lock any of that down quite yet.
[1049.82 → 1055.58] One thing I can tell you guys is very soon I will have an update for you on when ticket sales are going live.
[1055.80 → 1060.84] It looks like we've worked out most of the wrinkles with how we're splitting revenue with Dream Hack.
[1061.24 → 1063.50] So like it's going to be exciting.
[1063.76 → 1064.34] That's perfect.
[1064.70 → 1065.60] You know what's interesting?
[1065.60 → 1071.90] Have you noticed how challenging your hairdo is for online video compression to handle?
[1072.72 → 1073.18] Whoa.
[1073.60 → 1077.54] So let's go 1080p on YouTube over here.
[1078.76 → 1083.16] And especially when you look down, you can see it doesn't actually look that great.
[1083.46 → 1085.14] And then over on Flow plane.
[1085.82 → 1086.28] Hey.
[1086.62 → 1087.92] That actually looks really sharp.
[1087.98 → 1089.94] It actually looks a lot better, doesn't it?
[1090.46 → 1091.22] Pretty cool, huh?
[1091.54 → 1091.94] Damn.
[1092.20 → 1092.58] All right.
[1092.78 → 1093.32] That's cool.
[1093.32 → 1094.48] Hey.
[1094.68 → 1095.38] Flow plane looks great.
[1095.48 → 1099.34] Also, everyone that was subscribed on the 31st got their two free months.
[1100.52 → 1101.52] That was expensive.
[1101.82 → 1103.24] But it's done, so that's cool.
[1103.36 → 1104.62] How much did that cost us?
[1105.20 → 1105.60] Meh.
[1106.66 → 1107.00] Oh, yeah.
[1107.04 → 1111.36] I guess if we say that number, then people will know how many people are subscribed to Flow plane?
[1111.82 → 1114.26] People will know how many people are subscribed on the new site.
[1114.76 → 1116.68] Which is everything now.
[1116.68 → 1116.96] Yeah.
[1118.14 → 1119.12] Which is a lot lower.
[1119.24 → 1121.72] We lost some people in the transition, which is not surprising.
[1121.94 → 1122.82] We knew that was going to happen.
[1122.82 → 1123.34] Yeah, yeah.
[1123.44 → 1126.10] It's actually not as much lower as I thought it might have been.
[1126.20 → 1126.42] Really?
[1126.82 → 1127.16] Okay.
[1127.16 → 1130.72] But it also wasn't as great retention as I had hoped for.
[1130.84 → 1132.22] So we're kind of in the middle.
[1132.90 → 1133.22] You know what?
[1133.22 → 1134.08] I think it's okay.
[1134.44 → 1137.12] Because the thing we still haven't done.
[1137.36 → 1138.74] And it's crazy to think about it.
[1139.40 → 1146.90] Linus Media Group still hasn't done a dedicated video driving people to subscribe to Flow plane.
[1146.90 → 1148.26] That has never happened.
[1148.26 → 1148.48] No.
[1149.30 → 1152.06] So I think once we're ready to rock.
[1153.00 → 1155.42] Are we ever going to do a Scrapyard Wars again?
[1155.96 → 1157.12] I don't know.
[1157.88 → 1160.00] Secret Shopper was kind of like.
[1160.06 → 1160.34] Yeah.
[1160.34 → 1162.84] It felt like it.
[1162.90 → 1165.30] I got that sort of like vague vibe.
[1166.02 → 1166.42] Serialized.
[1166.52 → 1168.12] We're kind of like exploring something.
[1168.26 → 1169.06] There's some tension.
[1169.38 → 1169.98] There's like.
[1170.18 → 1171.28] More or less a team.
[1171.60 → 1172.68] More or less judgment.
[1172.68 → 1179.72] If the right deal came along where we could do Scrapyard Wars in a way that was really different from before.
[1179.88 → 1184.28] The problem is I think just shopping for used computer hardware in Langley.
[1184.74 → 1186.80] I feel like is kind of played out for me.
[1187.32 → 1189.44] Like I don't know what I would do that differently.
[1190.26 → 1191.08] Like we've kind of.
[1191.20 → 1191.24] Yeah.
[1191.30 → 1191.44] I know.
[1191.50 → 1191.74] I know.
[1191.88 → 1193.92] The stuff we joked about in the early seasons.
[1194.12 → 1197.90] Like oh what if I bought stuff and flipped it for a profit and put that towards my budget.
[1198.08 → 1198.22] Like.
[1198.62 → 1199.64] That's become a norm now.
[1199.64 → 1201.16] We just like all started doing it.
[1201.16 → 1201.36] Yeah.
[1201.36 → 1201.72] Yeah.
[1201.72 → 1201.90] Yeah.
[1201.90 → 1202.40] Yeah.
[1202.68 → 1204.20] And.
[1204.60 → 1207.18] And we've been to all like the weird haunts.
[1207.28 → 1208.86] Like I don't think there's going to be that many.
[1209.18 → 1209.44] Yeah.
[1209.54 → 1212.04] Like I'm not going to find another crack pipe in a computer.
[1212.18 → 1214.42] And if I did, it would be like been there done that.
[1214.60 → 1214.78] Yeah.
[1215.24 → 1218.78] Whereas if like a big sponsor came along.
[1218.86 → 1219.08] Yeah.
[1219.36 → 1219.92] There are ideas.
[1220.88 → 1225.14] We want to fund Scrapyard Wars Euro Tour.
[1225.96 → 1228.24] And we do like a crazy challenge.
[1228.24 → 1230.02] Like we're over there for two weeks.
[1230.02 → 1234.28] And you have to build an entire computer buying a different component.
[1234.62 → 1234.82] Per.
[1235.20 → 1237.36] Buying only one component per country.
[1237.52 → 1237.82] Yeah.
[1237.82 → 1241.86] Or something just utterly stupid like that.
[1242.10 → 1245.42] Where this is like this is a season of a show.
[1245.66 → 1245.90] Yeah.
[1246.20 → 1246.62] You know.
[1247.00 → 1248.38] And forget two weeks.
[1248.52 → 1251.34] Like we're over there for six weeks or something like that.
[1251.34 → 1254.46] And we've got celebrity entrance.
[1254.46 → 1256.40] And we've got like we've like.
[1256.40 → 1258.34] One thing I've even wanted to do.
[1258.96 → 1259.66] Then maybe.
[1259.98 → 1264.44] One thing I've wanted to do is where neither you nor me compete.
[1264.44 → 1266.92] And we commentate.
[1268.00 → 1270.04] But we like commentate live.
[1270.16 → 1271.80] It would either be great.
[1271.96 → 1273.30] Or horrible.
[1273.66 → 1275.18] And I don't know which one.
[1275.32 → 1279.60] And we'd have invested a week of everyone's time in it by the time we'd find out.
[1279.68 → 1280.44] Probably more.
[1280.52 → 1283.56] Because we'd probably have to edit the damn thing before we'd find out.
[1283.76 → 1283.96] Yeah.
[1284.60 → 1285.84] So that's really.
[1285.92 → 1287.08] That's really tough.
[1287.08 → 1287.80] That's a hard.
[1287.90 → 1289.42] That's a tough pill for me to swallow.
[1289.42 → 1291.78] Because when we have a situation like that.
[1291.90 → 1294.24] We can't ask an outside party to fund it.
[1295.26 → 1296.30] I have to fund it.
[1296.36 → 1296.58] Yeah.
[1296.68 → 1298.00] Because I don't know if it's going to work.
[1298.02 → 1300.52] One of the ideas that I had for that was.
[1300.70 → 1302.02] And I'm not saying this is better.
[1302.30 → 1303.04] Big warning.
[1304.26 → 1307.40] Is that it wasn't even really a GOD thing.
[1307.96 → 1309.74] We could maybe chop it up.
[1310.08 → 1311.32] And make them into Gods.
[1311.38 → 1314.14] But the idea would be we like confiscate devices.
[1314.14 → 1318.26] So you'd want actually like many hours.
[1318.68 → 1319.98] Of watchable content.
[1320.18 → 1320.64] Live stream.
[1320.92 → 1321.38] Live.
[1321.70 → 1324.70] And we have people with like mobile live-streaming rigs.
[1325.14 → 1326.94] Which I've been doing a lot of research on.
[1327.08 → 1328.46] And are like not that hard to build.
[1329.16 → 1331.18] Like actually perfect ones.
[1331.20 → 1331.34] Yeah.
[1331.42 → 1332.60] I built a terrible one once.
[1332.70 → 1333.12] That was cool.
[1333.20 → 1334.18] But you can build like.
[1334.24 → 1334.70] Yeah shut up.
[1334.92 → 1336.10] Actually very good ones.
[1336.10 → 1336.28] Have enough of your attitude.
[1336.52 → 1337.32] And it would be fine.
[1337.46 → 1337.66] Dirt.
[1337.96 → 1339.00] And you could like.
[1339.28 → 1341.68] We could have cameras following them throughout the whole day.
[1341.68 → 1344.12] And then just make sure that they're not allowed watching each other's streams.
[1344.44 → 1345.44] They can't go on to whatever.
[1345.58 → 1346.68] So they can't see what the other team is doing.
[1346.68 → 1348.74] Well everyone would see you stream peaking.
[1349.28 → 1349.50] Yeah.
[1349.68 → 1350.00] On stream.
[1350.16 → 1350.42] On stream.
[1350.66 → 1350.84] Yeah.
[1351.02 → 1351.66] So like it's.
[1351.98 → 1353.62] Unless you're in like the bathroom or something.
[1353.84 → 1354.06] Yeah.
[1354.24 → 1354.76] It's like okay.
[1354.82 → 1356.26] You'd have to have rules around bathrooms.
[1356.34 → 1357.58] Like look you got three minutes.
[1357.68 → 1357.88] Okay.
[1358.38 → 1358.60] Like.
[1358.92 → 1359.74] Confiscate people's phones.
[1359.74 → 1360.54] Get in there and get out.
[1360.64 → 1360.76] Yeah.
[1360.82 → 1361.40] Take their phones.
[1361.74 → 1361.92] Yeah.
[1362.06 → 1363.08] Just mute your mic.
[1363.08 → 1363.38] All right.
[1363.56 → 1363.74] Yeah.
[1367.24 → 1367.56] Yeah.
[1367.56 → 1368.20] I don't know.
[1368.32 → 1368.74] It could be.
[1368.88 → 1369.66] But then again.
[1369.94 → 1370.86] The same problem.
[1370.86 → 1374.34] It might be eight hours of just like boring trash.
[1374.80 → 1379.80] Which is like honestly has been the problem with episode one of almost every season.
[1379.92 → 1380.30] Yeah.
[1380.52 → 1381.70] With it cut down.
[1381.88 → 1382.22] Yeah.
[1382.22 → 1386.30] So like genuinely eight hours of people being like man I'm just really not finding anything
[1386.30 → 1386.88] on Craigslist.
[1387.24 → 1390.04] Like it could be like really, really bad.
[1390.24 → 1391.94] What's with all these old iMacs?
[1392.10 → 1392.50] Yeah.
[1392.84 → 1395.28] Does everyone in California just use the iMac?
[1396.10 → 1396.54] Exactly.
[1397.10 → 1397.90] So I don't know.
[1398.08 → 1399.56] I don't really know how to solve the problem.
[1399.78 → 1402.66] I was just thinking with like that would be a nice.
[1402.96 → 1405.52] Every time we do Scrapyard Wars float plane goes book.
[1406.14 → 1406.38] Yeah.
[1406.40 → 1406.66] I know.
[1406.66 → 1407.30] Every time.
[1407.30 → 1415.00] With that said it looks like the virtual ticket which I was asked not to talk about.
[1415.84 → 1417.38] Well it's too late now.
[1417.52 → 1417.92] We're live.
[1418.14 → 1422.12] The virtual ticket at LTX is probably going to have a strong float plane tie in.
[1422.64 → 1423.18] Oh cool.
[1423.40 → 1423.54] Yeah.
[1423.84 → 1427.36] So I would expect us to have some fairly compelling content.
[1427.86 → 1429.80] I would expect us to work together.
[1429.88 → 1430.84] I haven't talked to you about this yet.
[1430.84 → 1436.54] But I'd expect us to work together on a system where not just Linus Media Group but other
[1436.54 → 1440.38] creators who are also present at LTX.
[1440.38 → 1447.08] And also on the float plane platform could also get a nice little subscriber boost if people
[1447.08 → 1450.30] felt like supporting them for virtual ticket instead of LMG.
[1450.92 → 1451.26] Yeah.
[1451.26 → 1457.06] Which of course we'd be totally cool with because the way that I mean, so A float plane is actually
[1457.06 → 1458.60] legally a completely separate entity.
[1458.60 → 1469.34] And B Linus Media Group and LTX I would actually like for them to one day be not separate but
[1469.34 → 1471.00] capable of operating independently.
[1471.36 → 1471.56] Yeah.
[1471.68 → 1472.08] LTD.
[1472.24 → 1472.48] Yeah.
[1472.56 → 1473.10] That makes sense.
[1473.30 → 1476.00] It's kind of like the Penny Arcade and PAX situation.
[1476.80 → 1478.96] Like there are obvious associations between that.
[1479.14 → 1481.68] To be clear I have no intention of not showing up anymore.
[1482.14 → 1482.36] Yeah.
[1482.42 → 1482.58] Yeah.
[1482.58 → 1483.98] Except for during Backstreet Boys.
[1484.44 → 1485.32] Except for during Backstreet Boys.
[1485.32 → 1489.76] I am going to go to that concert and that's just going to have to be the way to do this.
[1490.08 → 1490.90] But like.
[1490.94 → 1491.74] I want it that way.
[1491.82 → 1492.14] There's a.
[1493.72 → 1494.44] There's a ton.
[1494.92 → 1501.14] There's a ton of people that go to PAX including myself that I mean no offence to Gabe and Tycho
[1501.14 → 1504.50] but like the only reason why I know their names is that I've been going for so long.
[1505.10 → 1505.24] Yeah.
[1505.24 → 1507.22] I never went because of them.
[1507.66 → 1510.40] I went because their show is really cool, and they did a great job with PAX.
[1510.80 → 1513.58] And I could see that becoming the future of other times as well.
[1513.58 → 1516.74] Dopey asks how long does it take to get a reply from the float plane support team?
[1517.16 → 1517.76] It's pretty fast.
[1517.86 → 1518.40] Pretty fast.
[1518.50 → 1522.38] But like we've been a little bit behind but like pretty fast.
[1522.48 → 1525.40] I do know that as of last night they zeroed out.
[1525.56 → 1526.46] There were no tickets.
[1526.82 → 1528.34] So should be pretty quick.
[1528.48 → 1531.80] Vic asks if the price of float plane will increase when it's announced on the YouTube channel.
[1531.88 → 1532.20] Absolutely.
[1532.66 → 1534.58] It will probably increase before that.
[1535.54 → 1536.36] Or you know what?
[1536.40 → 1536.68] Maybe.
[1536.78 → 1537.18] I don't know.
[1537.30 → 1537.66] You know what?
[1537.72 → 1538.54] We'll have to see.
[1538.62 → 1539.04] We'll decide.
[1539.16 → 1539.36] Sure.
[1539.72 → 1540.80] We'll decide what makes sense.
[1541.22 → 1543.48] Boo, Boo asks why are we paying USD when we're Canadian?
[1544.00 → 1544.94] It's a great question.
[1545.14 → 1549.06] It's because like it or not the US dollar is kind of the currency of the world.
[1549.30 → 1551.20] It's also way more stable in general.
[1551.74 → 1556.16] And we a lot of our bills a lot of float planes bills are in USD.
[1557.40 → 1562.12] It's also having one singular currency is much easier when you're a smaller team.
[1562.36 → 1565.80] Honestly the biggest reason is that nobody knows what the hell a Canadian dollar is.
[1566.34 → 1572.14] So if we say hey it's five Canadian dollars people are like is that a lot?
[1572.14 → 1576.18] If I can extrapolate his question I think he's asking to pay in localized currencies.
[1576.66 → 1577.34] Oh I see.
[1577.48 → 1580.82] Which like could be a thing eventually, but it's actually a lot of work.
[1580.96 → 1581.54] Give us time.
[1581.74 → 1583.86] A lot of work on multiple ends.
[1583.86 → 1584.16] Yeah.
[1584.16 → 1584.26] Yeah.
[1586.38 → 1586.74] Eventually.
[1587.42 → 1587.90] Alright.
[1588.38 → 1589.08] Why don't we.
[1589.40 → 1589.84] Oh wow.
[1589.94 → 1593.28] I was going to say we should do some topics, but then we have to do sponsor spots.
[1593.58 → 1593.94] Sponsors.
[1593.96 → 1595.74] Because we have to go right at six today.
[1595.94 → 1598.12] Because we are going to.
[1598.38 → 1598.70] Wait.
[1598.84 → 1599.62] Do people know?
[1599.74 → 1600.40] I don't know.
[1601.08 → 1602.22] Are we allowed to say?
[1602.54 → 1603.26] I don't know.
[1604.10 → 1605.20] I know we're like.
[1605.20 → 1611.94] I'm going to check with him.
[1613.30 → 1613.70] Okay.
[1613.92 → 1615.04] So we're going somewhere.
[1615.62 → 1616.88] We have a party to go to tonight.
[1617.06 → 1617.28] Yeah.
[1618.06 → 1618.54] So.
[1619.38 → 1620.66] Our sponsors for today.
[1620.78 → 1622.26] I actually have no idea who they are.
[1622.28 → 1623.26] I got locked out.
[1623.42 → 1624.34] You got locked out.
[1624.70 → 1626.56] Like the second that happened.
[1626.74 → 1627.18] Pulse way.
[1627.90 → 1633.42] Pulse way is the real time remote monitoring and management software that's actually so easy
[1633.42 → 1634.72] to use that I can do it.
[1634.72 → 1637.44] You can manage and monitor from one app.
[1637.60 → 1642.14] It's compatible with Windows, Mac, Linux and applications and gets you access to real time
[1642.14 → 1647.76] status, system resources, logged-in users, network performance, Windows updates and more.
[1647.88 → 1651.02] So you can fix problems on the go by sending commands from any mobile device.
[1651.44 → 1654.52] You can create and deploy custom scripts to automate your IT tasks.
[1654.98 → 1657.46] You can scan, install and update all your systems on the go.
[1657.54 → 1658.88] It's got remote desktop functionality.
[1658.88 → 1662.80] And my favourite thing is like honestly one of the simplest thing it does.
[1662.80 → 1665.24] But it's its made my life so much better.
[1665.42 → 1671.30] I get a ping every time WANT server is under 10% storage space so that I can go hit ed.
[1671.88 → 1673.72] And get the editors to offload their.
[1674.30 → 1675.40] Hey, hey, delete things.
[1675.44 → 1676.58] Offload their files to the vault.
[1676.58 → 1682.92] Honestly, though, it has saved us so much hassle with the like the camera guys going to ingest
[1682.92 → 1686.52] something, and it's full or like they start an ingest overnight, come back in the morning.
[1686.62 → 1687.34] It didn't complete.
[1687.44 → 1688.92] Now we've got to do the whole thing all over again.
[1688.98 → 1690.52] That edit that was supposed to start in the morning.
[1690.76 → 1692.08] Can't start like.
[1693.52 → 1694.26] Yay, Pulse way.
[1694.38 → 1695.92] It's the very real world example.
[1695.92 → 1699.40] So try it for free at Pulseway.com right there.
[1699.40 → 1702.52] Also sponsoring today's episode, private internet access.
[1702.80 → 1706.04] We've actually been working with PIA for almost a year now.
[1706.14 → 1706.50] It's been a while.
[1706.76 → 1707.64] It has been a while.
[1707.78 → 1712.26] And it's one of those sponsors that's great because I haven't gotten a single complaint.
[1712.26 → 1713.24] I was just going to say no complaints.
[1713.42 → 1714.50] Not one.
[1714.56 → 1714.94] No complaints.
[1715.02 → 1715.54] It's affordable.
[1715.92 → 1719.78] It works on Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Linux, and Google Chrome.
[1719.78 → 1724.82] You can connect up to five devices at a time on the same account, which is flipping sick.
[1724.82 → 1729.18] And it's got all the VPN functionality that you could pretty much ask for.
[1729.32 → 1733.40] Go check it out at leg.GG slash PIA when.
[1734.00 → 1738.30] Finally, we have a bit of an unusual sponsor.
[1738.38 → 1739.28] I saw this.
[1739.76 → 1740.48] That's really cool.
[1740.48 → 1740.80] Semidirect.
[1741.52 → 1743.06] This right here.
[1743.54 → 1744.74] This is really cool.
[1744.88 → 1746.18] And it's still wrapped.
[1746.34 → 1747.08] Dang it, Jon.
[1747.20 → 1748.32] I'm assuming this was Jon.
[1748.32 → 1757.40] So these guys have all kinds of like audio, video, data connectivity solutions.
[1757.92 → 1759.56] Everything you need for your next project.
[1759.76 → 1762.04] And one in particular is really cool.
[1762.30 → 1762.78] So sweet.
[1762.80 → 1765.50] So this is their Light Link cable.
[1766.02 → 1767.70] And it is a 300.
[1768.66 → 1771.28] Is that, does that say, wait, is that meter?
[1772.08 → 1773.52] I thought it was feet.
[1773.58 → 1774.34] 300 foot.
[1774.44 → 1774.90] Oh, okay.
[1774.96 → 1775.56] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1775.56 → 1779.68] So a hundred meter, 300 foot HDMI cable.
[1779.78 → 1780.68] It's an active cable.
[1780.90 → 1783.82] So you've got to go, okay, this one is labelled for source.
[1783.96 → 1785.82] And this one's labelled for display.
[1786.50 → 1788.68] But, what?
[1789.30 → 1795.00] So basically it takes, so it's HDMI over fibre and utilizes a converter in the head to turn
[1795.00 → 1797.76] electrical signals into optical signals.
[1797.76 → 1802.58] Because it uses fibre, it can send the signal instantaneously with no perceptible latency
[1802.58 → 1804.96] at longer distances than regular HDMI.
[1805.26 → 1807.58] And this is without any need for repeaters.
[1807.92 → 1815.00] And you can check out this and many, many other AV solutions over at SewellDirect.com.
[1815.08 → 1819.64] And you can save 20% on all their HDMI cables using offer code Linus Tech.
[1819.64 → 1822.48] So we'll have that linked below for you there.
[1824.06 → 1825.84] Should we do any news?
[1826.20 → 1826.68] Oh, hold on.
[1826.72 → 1827.50] I'm about to find out.
[1827.84 → 1829.04] Oh, no.
[1829.42 → 1832.08] He would prefer if we did not.
[1832.84 → 1833.94] Especially on WAN Show.
[1834.28 → 1834.72] All right.
[1834.94 → 1838.70] So we are going to a party, but we can't say why.
[1838.90 → 1839.12] Yeah.
[1839.22 → 1841.22] Or what it's for or why it's really exciting.
[1841.30 → 1842.40] I'm really sorry, you guys.
[1842.94 → 1844.72] I'm sorry I brought it up in the first place.
[1844.72 → 1848.60] This particular person on staff is quite private.
[1849.38 → 1849.56] Yeah.
[1850.40 → 1854.96] Actually, they were the one that showed me the whole flag thing with Wil Wheaton.
[1855.68 → 1856.76] You know about this?
[1856.78 → 1857.14] You see this?
[1857.18 → 1857.74] You heard about this?
[1858.20 → 1861.50] So Will When put up a flag.
[1861.62 → 1862.76] I forget what the flag was.
[1862.80 → 1863.54] An American flag?
[1863.64 → 1863.94] I don't know.
[1863.98 → 1864.68] It was some kind of flag.
[1865.16 → 1867.64] And it was basically like a silent...
[1867.64 → 1867.96] Wil Wheaton.
[1868.32 → 1868.88] Oh, no.
[1868.94 → 1869.12] Sorry.
[1870.16 → 1871.02] The other guy.
[1871.18 → 1871.80] Shia LaBeouf.
[1871.98 → 1872.44] Shia LaBeouf.
[1872.52 → 1872.70] Whatever.
[1872.84 → 1873.66] They both look the same to me.
[1873.68 → 1874.44] Yeah, I know this whole story.
[1874.44 → 1874.76] Sorry.
[1874.76 → 1875.12] It's great.
[1875.22 → 1876.24] Go keep going because they should know.
[1876.34 → 1876.46] Yeah.
[1876.56 → 1876.78] Okay.
[1876.88 → 1878.70] So anyway, Shia LaBeouf puts up...
[1878.70 → 1879.38] Sorry, not Wil Wheaton.
[1879.52 → 1880.62] I was so confused.
[1880.68 → 1881.28] Yeah, I'm sorry.
[1881.32 → 1881.76] I'm sorry.
[1881.94 → 1882.26] I'm sorry.
[1882.34 → 1884.40] They're both just like living internet memes.
[1884.54 → 1884.90] Yeah.
[1885.22 → 1887.14] I understand, to be fair.
[1887.54 → 1889.78] I think that's why I figured out who it was so quickly.
[1890.04 → 1893.98] So Shia LaBeouf put up this flag that was like some kind of Trump protest or something.
[1894.00 → 1895.76] We will stand together or something like that.
[1895.98 → 1898.34] And then it was live-streamed.
[1898.34 → 1900.02] So it had a camera pointed at it.
[1900.02 → 1904.82] And it was supposed to be impossible to find because it was just a flag in a field.
[1904.82 → 1907.58] And you couldn't really see anything other than the sky behind it.
[1907.66 → 1908.78] He will not divide us.
[1908.98 → 1909.24] Sure.
[1910.00 → 1910.48] Yeah.
[1910.60 → 1911.12] Yeah, that's right.
[1911.34 → 1911.96] Thank you.
[1911.96 → 1930.96] And then basically 4chan put their collective heads together and managed to determine from the paths of aircraft flying behind it, because it was a live stream, where exactly it was and find it and replace it with...
[1931.72 → 1933.68] What did they replace it with?
[1933.96 → 1935.58] I thought it was a Pepe flag.
[1935.74 → 1937.16] Pepe flag or something like that?
[1937.20 → 1937.54] I don't know.
[1937.54 → 1937.80] Whatever.
[1937.92 → 1941.54] The point is, this particular member of our staff who...
[1942.22 → 1943.44] They definitely stole it.
[1943.52 → 1944.80] Yeah, they definitely stole the flag.
[1944.92 → 1945.26] I don't know.
[1945.34 → 1945.52] Yeah.
[1945.70 → 1955.94] Drew my attention to this and basically said, this is why, you know, I won't post any pictures on the internet, even of like my wall.
[1956.48 → 1959.94] Because given enough time and enough people...
[1959.94 → 1962.06] Don't you remember the old studio?
[1963.30 → 1964.22] Which old studio?
[1964.38 → 1964.88] The house?
[1965.10 → 1965.48] Yeah, yeah.
[1965.48 → 1969.14] When the person recognized what house it was, based on the floor?
[1969.50 → 1970.12] Yeah, because...
[1970.12 → 1971.22] Wait, based on the floor?
[1971.36 → 1972.10] Wasn't it the floor?
[1972.36 → 1972.86] Oh, I don't remember.
[1972.86 → 1974.32] I might not remember this story properly.
[1974.48 → 1988.04] So we did have, within like days of us moving into our old studio, the house, someone had looked up like real estate listings for houses that were recently sold in that area.
[1988.04 → 1991.72] Like the detective work involved in this one honestly isn't even that deep.
[1991.72 → 1992.08] Yeah.
[1992.20 → 1993.26] Because they were able to look.
[1993.46 → 1994.72] And then out of...
[1994.72 → 2000.10] Actually, I think there were several houses with the same floor plan because it's one of those really samey subdivisions.
[2000.10 → 2000.72] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2000.72 → 2003.60] They managed to determine which exact one it was.
[2003.60 → 2006.20] And I think they like left something on the doorstep or something.
[2006.26 → 2008.64] So needless to say, that was pretty creepy for us at the time.
[2009.18 → 2012.18] And actually, it was part of the reason why I just gave up.
[2012.32 → 2017.22] And that's why our address for this studio is on our website, minusmediagroup.com.
[2017.22 → 2017.96] As public as possible.
[2017.96 → 2028.50] On Google, because like really, ever since we did that, all the intrigue, all the excitement around where do they film is just dead.
[2028.68 → 2031.12] I've had people ask like, where do I send fan mail?
[2031.26 → 2033.46] I've had random people with just, how do I ship you stuff?
[2033.50 → 2035.10] I'm like, ah, just Google it.
[2035.10 → 2036.08] Yeah, literally.
[2036.32 → 2037.00] Super easy.
[2037.16 → 2037.70] No problem.
[2037.88 → 2038.54] It's right there.
[2038.60 → 2041.90] Don't worry about me sending you the answer because you can look it up at any time on Google Maps.
[2042.02 → 2042.22] Yep.
[2042.42 → 2046.08] And to be clear, I'm not advocating this solution for every creator.
[2046.08 → 2048.44] I mean, there was a good idea for everyone.
[2048.44 → 2051.70] I mean, there was Gavin from Slo-Mo Guys had a gunman show up at his house.
[2051.98 → 2055.50] Well, so did Dr. Disrespect.
[2056.00 → 2056.36] Really?
[2056.52 → 2058.78] Two drive-bys on his house, bullets through the building.
[2058.92 → 2059.62] When did that happen?
[2059.72 → 2060.66] This was fairly recently.
[2061.10 → 2061.58] Wow.
[2061.80 → 2062.66] Yeah, like people suck.
[2062.76 → 2064.40] So like, maybe not the greatest.
[2065.38 → 2069.76] The good news for us is we make relatively uncontroversial content.
[2070.00 → 2070.16] Yeah.
[2070.84 → 2072.80] Hey, you like that computer stuff?
[2073.18 → 2073.40] Yeah.
[2073.92 → 2074.60] Me too.
[2074.92 → 2075.28] Yeah.
[2075.76 → 2075.92] Woo!
[2076.08 → 2076.52] Sweet.
[2078.14 → 2080.60] What did Dr. Disrespect ever do to anyone?
[2081.30 → 2082.42] Probably disrespected them.
[2085.70 → 2092.44] Yeah, you better applaud yourself because...
[2092.44 → 2094.06] I'm not getting it from anybody else.
[2094.16 → 2094.40] No.
[2095.86 → 2097.22] I'll pat myself on the back.
[2097.72 → 2099.00] You're most...
[2099.00 → 2100.56] Most certainly not.
[2102.98 → 2103.84] Oh, man.
[2104.44 → 2105.76] That was great.
[2105.76 → 2110.18] Nerd cubed apparently got a crazy fan show up outside their apartment door because they
[2110.18 → 2112.94] accidentally showed the floor outside his apartment.
[2114.98 → 2115.46] Yeah.
[2118.46 → 2118.90] Yeah.
[2119.12 → 2119.48] It's a thing.
[2119.70 → 2120.18] People suck.
[2120.38 → 2126.76] But like, if you remove some of the mystique and the potential intrigue...
[2126.76 → 2130.38] It has worked great for us for the last three and a half years.
[2130.98 → 2131.60] Knock, knock.
[2131.60 → 2132.00] Yeah.
[2132.34 → 2133.26] And it's been good.
[2133.30 → 2136.88] I think overall, actually, our community is sort of a cut above some of the other ones,
[2136.96 → 2137.08] though.
[2137.44 → 2140.36] And I don't say that to like, try to kiss ass or whatever else.
[2140.40 → 2141.10] It's not about that.
[2141.10 → 2148.08] It's just like, if you go into our comment section and then go to any other video on the internet
[2148.08 → 2155.00] and go to the comment section, like even on YouTube, which is an utter cesspool, YouTube
[2155.00 → 2155.60] comment section.
[2155.82 → 2157.26] It's horrendous.
[2158.50 → 2161.04] Ours is for the most part really respectful.
[2162.16 → 2162.64] Generally.
[2162.78 → 2162.88] Yeah.
[2162.92 → 2164.88] It's still not like, obviously, it's not perfect.
[2165.08 → 2165.50] Any complete...
[2165.50 → 2165.92] Hope Plains is better.
[2165.92 → 2166.36] Yeah.
[2167.08 → 2169.94] I didn't want to shill too hard, but it is.
[2170.62 → 2175.66] But like, any open public forum is going to have some Garbo.
[2175.70 → 2176.26] Some disagreement.
[2176.48 → 2176.76] Yeah.
[2176.96 → 2177.20] Yeah.
[2177.32 → 2178.74] Like, it's going to happen.
[2179.70 → 2179.78] Whatever.
[2179.94 → 2180.70] But it's not bad.
[2180.88 → 2181.10] Yeah.
[2182.16 → 2184.32] Speaking of bad, FaceTime's bug.
[2184.40 → 2189.18] This was originally posted on 9to5Mac, or at least our article that we got the source
[2189.18 → 2189.84] from is here.
[2189.98 → 2190.90] Oh, from the forum.
[2191.22 → 2195.50] Posted by Suits on the Forum and their article that they were referencing is 9to5mac.com.
[2195.92 → 2200.06] A bug discovered this week lets you call anyone with FaceTime and immediately hear the audio
[2200.06 → 2203.46] coming from their phone before the person on the other end has accepted the incoming call.
[2204.56 → 2205.94] It's not technically immediate.
[2207.38 → 2210.74] You add person to create a group call, and then you add your own number.
[2211.64 → 2217.16] So it's like, it takes a little step, but like, if they're not by their phone, you're
[2217.16 → 2217.92] going to get it.
[2220.32 → 2220.72] Oh.
[2221.50 → 2222.58] We're still here.
[2222.86 → 2224.70] Did someone just turn off the lights?
[2225.92 → 2227.90] Oh, wait.
[2228.04 → 2228.88] Oh, I think it's fine.
[2228.94 → 2229.14] No, no.
[2229.18 → 2229.88] That was his light.
[2229.96 → 2231.22] It's just, it was bright.
[2231.34 → 2232.28] Like, look, we still look fine.
[2232.42 → 2232.90] And that one.
[2234.20 → 2234.60] Okay.
[2234.70 → 2235.00] And this one.
[2235.64 → 2236.04] Cool.
[2236.14 → 2236.26] Yeah.
[2236.32 → 2239.70] Brandon just hit the like, the Casa scene, everything off.
[2239.84 → 2240.24] And that one.
[2240.30 → 2243.36] For some reason, the blue one's on a Casa module, but the red one's not.
[2243.74 → 2245.86] So I'm not sure what the deal is there exactly.
[2246.70 → 2247.38] That's fine.
[2247.38 → 2252.72] Anyway, Apple has temporarily disabled group FaceTime calls, giving themselves time to fix
[2252.72 → 2254.06] the bug without breaking other things.
[2254.16 → 2255.88] And the bug was found by a 14-year-old.
[2256.42 → 2256.48] Nice.
[2256.48 → 2260.62] He and his mother tried to report it for days before Apple responded, going as far as registering
[2260.62 → 2262.98] as developers in the bug bounty program.
[2263.10 → 2265.80] Apple has apologized for the bug and says a fix is coming in the next week.
[2266.12 → 2269.18] Have they committed to, like, give a bunch of money to this kid yet?
[2269.44 → 2270.02] They should.
[2270.20 → 2271.20] They probably should.
[2271.38 → 2271.62] Yeah.
[2271.62 → 2276.02] In other news, this was posted by RC Mihail on the forum.
[2276.12 → 2277.94] There was a big data breach, actually.
[2277.94 → 2278.12] Yeah.
[2278.12 → 2279.10] A bunch of big data breaches.
[2279.52 → 2279.96] Massive.
[2280.34 → 2282.10] So we had Collection 1.
[2282.60 → 2284.60] What was this, like, last week or something like that?
[2285.26 → 2286.02] Very recently.
[2286.08 → 2286.60] I don't remember exactly.
[2286.66 → 2287.08] I don't remember.
[2287.18 → 2287.80] Big data breach.
[2287.94 → 2291.04] Now we've got Collections 2 through 5 or something like that.
[2291.58 → 2296.26] The biggest one is Collection 2 at 526 gigs of text.
[2296.30 → 2299.40] And the price for lifetime access to it is just $45.
[2299.40 → 2305.56] The hacker has access to some 4 terabytes of password packages, which are less than a year old.
[2305.64 → 2309.44] So if you want to know if you've been pwned, check haveibeenpwned.com.
[2309.62 → 2310.38] You probably have.
[2310.44 → 2311.80] You've probably been pwned.
[2311.84 → 2312.70] I'm sure I've been pwned.
[2312.74 → 2314.08] I'm going to find out if I've been pwned.
[2314.38 → 2318.14] Most of my emails have been pwned multiple times at this point.
[2318.62 → 2319.78] But not all of them.
[2321.94 → 2324.96] Let's find out if my work email has been pwned.
[2325.14 → 2325.66] Pwned?
[2325.98 → 2327.68] Oh, no.
[2328.04 → 2328.60] Pwned.
[2328.60 → 2329.46] How many times?
[2329.62 → 2330.36] Five times.
[2330.38 → 2331.42] Five times.
[2332.04 → 2332.52] Boom.
[2334.76 → 2338.22] A couple of my newer, fresher emails haven't been pwned yet.
[2338.38 → 2339.18] And it's like a nice...
[2339.18 → 2341.04] Oh, it's new and shiny.
[2342.64 → 2345.08] Let's find out if my personal email has been pwned.
[2345.24 → 2345.56] Whoa!
[2346.56 → 2347.96] Now pwned is found!
[2348.60 → 2349.08] Crazy.
[2349.14 → 2350.00] I don't really use it for anything.
[2350.00 → 2356.76] Now, now, let's try my email that has been leaked multiple times, like online as tech tips.
[2356.86 → 2357.76] I'm even just going to say it.
[2357.80 → 2359.58] The peanuts' gallery at hotmail.com.
[2359.64 → 2359.80] Okay?
[2360.24 → 2360.40] Here.
[2360.50 → 2364.02] We're going to find out together if I have been pwned.
[2364.10 → 2366.36] Let's just make sure there's nothing incriminating on the screen here.
[2366.48 → 2367.14] Oh, wrong screen.
[2367.58 → 2367.76] Right.
[2367.76 → 2368.38] That was right.
[2368.38 → 2371.04] One second here.
[2371.14 → 2371.56] Hold on.
[2372.18 → 2373.50] Have I been pwned?
[2375.50 → 2376.92] There wasn't, so it doesn't matter.
[2376.92 → 2378.22] All right.
[2378.36 → 2382.56] So this one, this one's great because I've had it since I was like in high school.
[2382.76 → 2382.96] Yeah.
[2382.96 → 2384.74] And it's funny because it's a pun.
[2385.94 → 2390.12] So it's peanuts, which is that, that comic strip with the character Linus.
[2390.36 → 2395.20] And it's the peanut gallery, which was like the riffraff in Shakespearean times that like
[2395.20 → 2397.68] ate all the peanuts and left peanut shells all over the floor.
[2397.74 → 2400.54] The standing, the standing only like the yahoos.
[2400.78 → 2400.98] Yeah.
[2401.06 → 2403.06] So I was like the peanuts' gallery.
[2403.18 → 2403.68] Ha ha ha.
[2403.76 → 2404.22] Aren't I funny?
[2404.26 → 2405.66] No one ever got it.
[2405.76 → 2407.20] Just, oh, it's awful.
[2407.50 → 2408.10] You know what mine was?
[2408.18 → 2408.64] It was awful.
[2408.86 → 2409.28] What was yours?
[2410.22 → 2410.58] Ladiesboy54.
[2411.26 → 2411.78] No way.
[2411.78 → 2412.74] At hotmail.com.
[2412.74 → 2413.50] No way.
[2414.02 → 2414.34] 100%.
[2414.34 → 2416.18] Ladiesboy54.
[2416.36 → 2418.34] I hadn't picked my actual favourite number yet.
[2418.60 → 2421.74] So it was like close because it was 54, but my favourite number became 57.
[2422.68 → 2424.82] And one of my friends convinced me.
[2424.82 → 2425.88] Why ladies boy?
[2425.98 → 2428.88] One of my friends convinced me to do ladies man, and I was like, I'm not a man.
[2431.44 → 2432.70] I'm not a man.
[2432.78 → 2433.26] I are dead.
[2433.34 → 2435.90] I can't be a man.
[2436.22 → 2437.74] I can't put man in my email.
[2437.92 → 2438.72] I'm not a man.
[2439.12 → 2440.62] I actually missed my old email.
[2440.62 → 2445.62] My first email address was mum underscore the underscore cow at hotmail.com.
[2448.16 → 2449.28] That's actually amazing.
[2449.40 → 2454.42] I have never actually had a short and sweet email address.
[2454.42 → 2460.74] Like even back when you could get short email addresses, I was like, nah, dog.
[2460.74 → 2462.32] I want to have my whole name or whatever.
[2462.74 → 2465.30] I refused to have numbers in any of my handles.
[2465.86 → 2466.20] Okay.
[2466.30 → 2468.40] That has kind of like always been my jam.
[2468.48 → 2473.52] Because like imagine if floatplane.com was like floatplane57.com.
[2473.60 → 2474.48] This is stupid.
[2474.48 → 2475.96] That sucks.
[2476.18 → 2476.72] Yeah, it does.
[2477.16 → 2481.26] And like especially when your name is Linus Sebastian, there's not really an excuse.
[2481.56 → 2481.88] What was it?
[2481.94 → 2482.68] Mum the cow?
[2482.78 → 2485.88] Mum underscore the underscore cow at hotmail.com.
[2485.90 → 2486.52] That's so good.
[2486.62 → 2487.44] And people would be like, why?
[2487.96 → 2489.10] Like, why not?
[2489.46 → 2491.42] The only really, the only account.
[2491.42 → 2494.40] Better than Sturdy Stan, which was like my best friend's email at the time.
[2494.52 → 2495.30] Oh my god.
[2495.30 → 2497.26] I was like, what is Sturdy Stan?
[2497.40 → 2498.66] Your name isn't even Stan.
[2500.94 → 2505.60] The main accounts I would like to get back are not emails at this point.
[2505.68 → 2505.96] Really?
[2506.04 → 2507.46] I don't care about ladies boyfriend.
[2507.46 → 2509.24] Do you have like a five-minute Steam account or something?
[2509.24 → 2512.24] If someone gets that, like, that's weird, but whatever.
[2513.02 → 2515.86] No, I still have my old Steam account from forever ago.
[2515.98 → 2521.06] I want my RuneScape account from dial-up internet days.
[2521.52 → 2521.92] Oh.
[2522.12 → 2523.56] Because apparently they're still around.
[2523.68 → 2524.44] I've tried.
[2524.44 → 2526.14] I can't get it.
[2526.54 → 2530.26] If anyone from the RuneScape team is watching, Luke wants his RuneScape account back.
[2530.26 → 2532.56] I would love, I will give you all the information I possibly can.
[2532.64 → 2533.96] I would love to get that account back.
[2534.06 → 2535.58] Watch it shows up on Have I Been Pwned.
[2535.88 → 2536.24] That would be so cool.
[2536.24 → 2536.40] Yeah.
[2536.72 → 2537.48] Got pwned.
[2537.74 → 2538.74] That's back from when.
[2538.74 → 2539.52] Not actually RuneScape dev.
[2539.72 → 2540.82] Did you ever play RuneScape?
[2541.02 → 2541.30] No.
[2541.58 → 2543.64] So when you're walking around, if people are talking to each other.
[2543.76 → 2543.94] Yeah.
[2544.06 → 2545.34] You see speech bubbles above their heads.
[2545.34 → 2545.58] Yeah, yeah.
[2545.66 → 2547.08] And they'll like stand near each other and talk to each other.
[2547.18 → 2547.34] It's fine.
[2548.32 → 2549.92] That was so early on in my gaming.
[2550.42 → 2552.84] And it was so early on in online gaming in general.
[2552.94 → 2553.10] Yeah.
[2553.10 → 2554.92] I would always think they were talking to me.
[2555.72 → 2558.58] So I would answer everybody that I walked by.
[2561.58 → 2563.60] I just want to see like what I had.
[2563.72 → 2564.72] Like what was I doing?
[2564.94 → 2565.48] You know what I mean?
[2565.66 → 2569.52] I feel like it would be a fascinating window into like what I was interested in that time.
[2569.54 → 2569.56] Yeah.
[2569.62 → 2569.80] That is interesting.
[2569.80 → 2570.78] What were my main skills?
[2570.96 → 2572.14] Like what was I working on?
[2572.58 → 2573.82] I just feel like it would be kind of cool.
[2574.52 → 2574.70] All right.
[2574.70 → 2576.78] But it's my RuneScape account and my Neopets account for the same reason.
[2576.78 → 2577.34] Neopets.
[2577.48 → 2578.22] Hell yeah, dude.
[2578.30 → 2579.34] Neopets was sick.
[2579.96 → 2580.32] All right.
[2580.32 → 2581.34] I love the casino games all the time.
[2581.48 → 2582.34] Have I been pwned?
[2583.42 → 2584.10] Oh, no.
[2584.22 → 2584.36] Wow.
[2584.40 → 2584.94] Only two?
[2585.70 → 2586.88] That's actually surprisingly low.
[2587.06 → 2587.36] Wow.
[2587.52 → 2589.06] What about the public one for work?
[2590.12 → 2591.82] The public one for work.
[2591.94 → 2592.48] Oh, wow.
[2592.62 → 2593.80] I was vague because I didn't.
[2594.82 → 2595.08] Okay.
[2595.14 → 2595.30] Yeah.
[2595.30 → 2599.82] Ten breaches.
[2599.82 → 2599.86] Ten breaches.
[2599.86 → 2600.16] Ten breaches.
[2600.16 → 2600.26] Ten breaches.
[2601.26 → 2601.70] Ooh.
[2601.98 → 2603.60] Three steps to better security.
[2603.76 → 2604.88] One, don't be an idiot.
[2605.42 → 2605.82] Two.
[2607.52 → 2608.54] Oh, jeez.
[2609.28 → 2610.08] That's awesome.
[2610.38 → 2611.22] Oh, man.
[2611.46 → 2615.72] Speaking of awesome, that's it for the awesome WAN show for the day.
[2615.96 → 2618.74] We will see you guys again next week.
[2619.10 → 2621.62] Same bat time, same bat channel.
[2621.72 → 2621.86] Wait.
[2621.96 → 2622.24] Thumbs up.
[2622.26 → 2622.88] Why am I doing that?
[2622.88 → 2623.46] It's good.
[2623.80 → 2625.58] Well, it's bad that it's over, but it's good that it's good.
[2625.58 → 2626.86] Also, the channel's down there.
[2626.98 → 2627.62] Good that it's coming.
[2627.90 → 2629.52] No, that's the LTT zone.
[2629.54 → 2630.30] Oh, oh, oh.
[2630.48 → 2631.20] What do you think of this?
[2631.72 → 2632.26] I've seen it.
[2632.26 → 2632.92] Have you seen this yet?
[2633.04 → 2634.20] No, I think it looks really sharp.
[2634.52 → 2634.68] Yeah.
[2634.76 → 2636.64] This is our latest hoodie design.
[2636.66 → 2637.62] Show the...
[2637.62 → 2639.94] Really cool.
[2640.18 → 2640.36] Yeah.
[2640.98 → 2642.64] But not too over the top.
[2642.84 → 2645.30] And if you're just like this, it's just like, you know, whatever.
[2645.74 → 2647.08] You won't fully even be able to read it.
[2647.16 → 2648.46] I really like the pocket logo.
[2648.78 → 2650.04] The only logo is right there.
[2650.82 → 2652.12] The back is just clean.
[2652.88 → 2653.20] See?
[2653.52 → 2654.26] I like this.
[2654.74 → 2654.90] Yeah.
[2654.90 → 2656.02] The lines on the back look sharp.
[2656.66 → 2656.90] Yeah.
[2657.04 → 2663.58] So that's been our whole thing over the last, like, 10 months is trying to make just way
[2663.58 → 2664.20] better merch.
[2664.48 → 2664.68] Yeah.
[2664.80 → 2666.40] Like, a hundred times better merch.
[2666.56 → 2667.78] And you guys have been succeeding.
[2667.94 → 2670.18] My favourite shirt is the like, Constellation shirt.
[2670.36 → 2673.64] Like, my favourite shirt that I own in general is the Constellation shirt.
[2673.72 → 2674.04] They're comfy.
[2674.26 → 2675.28] They're so comfy now.
[2675.28 → 2676.78] Like, yeah, I'm really happy.
[2677.32 → 2680.38] So, guys, you can check out LTTstore.com for dank merch.
[2680.48 → 2681.28] This isn't there yet.
[2681.36 → 2684.02] This is still, like, many weeks away, unfortunately.
[2684.64 → 2686.70] Have you seen Project Codename Batman?
[2686.70 → 2689.00] It's a different hoodie.
[2689.92 → 2690.20] No.
[2690.30 → 2693.04] It's a little more, like, biker jacket-y looking.
[2693.28 → 2693.56] Okay.
[2693.64 → 2696.68] Like, it's a much more aggressive style.
[2696.80 → 2697.86] This one's more stealthy.
[2698.28 → 2699.52] It's going to be more expensive.
[2700.20 → 2701.74] It's going to be a really different material.
[2701.88 → 2702.94] We're calling it a swacked.
[2704.28 → 2704.92] Sweater jacket?
[2704.92 → 2705.28] Yeah.
[2705.36 → 2707.12] It's kind of a sweater jacket.
[2708.08 → 2710.46] Oh, did I even show you the coolest feature of this thing?
[2710.62 → 2710.84] No.
[2711.48 → 2712.28] It's got a phone pocket.
[2712.32 → 2712.84] Phone pocket.
[2713.06 → 2719.16] That, unlike a lot of other phone pockets I've encountered, is actually, like, impossible to accidentally get your phone out of.
[2719.60 → 2720.00] Okay.
[2720.06 → 2721.46] I was really scared when you started doing that.
[2722.02 → 2722.42] Ah!
[2724.18 → 2726.64] I feel like terrible infomercial man right now.
[2726.66 → 2727.60] But that's actually pretty cool.
[2727.72 → 2727.90] Yeah.
[2728.10 → 2728.30] Yeah.
[2728.56 → 2728.74] Yeah.
[2728.96 → 2729.24] I'm happy.
[2729.30 → 2731.78] It does take, it's kind of hard to put the phone in.
[2732.52 → 2733.64] But if it's secure.
[2733.64 → 2735.00] But that's the trade-off.
[2735.36 → 2740.96] I jumped over a like, security barrier pole at BIT once when I was trying to run to class.
[2741.06 → 2747.26] And my phone flopped out of my exactly side pocket like that in my sweater and smacked into the ground and exploded into a million pieces.
[2747.54 → 2747.82] Okay.
[2747.96 → 2749.86] Luckily, it was an S3, so I put it back together and it was fine.
[2749.98 → 2750.24] But, yeah.
[2750.34 → 2751.06] Got a second here.
[2751.94 → 2753.06] Brian Leon's.
[2753.38 → 2753.76] Leon's?
[2754.50 → 2754.92] You're done.
[2755.68 → 2755.98] Whoa.
[2756.60 → 2757.06] You're done.
[2757.42 → 2757.74] Okay.
[2757.86 → 2758.10] Okay.
[2758.32 → 2759.40] So, his comment here.
[2759.54 → 2759.80] Okay.
[2760.02 → 2760.26] All right.
[2760.26 → 2761.44] Mr. Leon's here.
[2761.44 → 2766.86] Linus just named himself Linus after the Peanuts piano player.
[2767.26 → 2769.48] His real name is Rudolph Ransom.
[2770.08 → 2770.38] All right.
[2772.58 → 2774.64] Schroeder plays the piano.
[2776.56 → 2777.64] Linus has the blanket.
[2779.16 → 2779.94] Get it right.
[2782.22 → 2783.22] Maybe super chats.
[2783.72 → 2784.24] Oh.
[2784.98 → 2785.54] Super chats.
[2785.72 → 2786.02] Hey.
[2786.14 → 2786.50] Hey.
[2786.58 → 2787.20] I got you.
[2787.20 → 2789.70] Oh, Lord.
[2789.74 → 2790.50] There's a bunch of them.
[2792.16 → 2796.20] Why is the WAN Show Archive playlist has videos starting from 2013 only?
[2796.38 → 2798.70] We don't really update it anymore because we're lazy.
[2798.96 → 2799.18] Sorry.
[2799.58 → 2801.06] Thank you for the 100 rubles.
[2801.16 → 2802.46] I have no idea how much that is.
[2803.14 → 2804.34] Stupid idea for a video.
[2804.46 → 2804.98] From Jake.
[2805.86 → 2808.14] Underclocking a high-end system to the point of barely stable.
[2808.68 → 2809.08] Why?
[2809.60 → 2810.74] For ship and giggles.
[2811.36 → 2812.96] That's basically every video.
[2812.96 → 2813.44] Yeah.
[2813.52 → 2814.68] Oh, underclocking.
[2814.74 → 2814.86] Oh.
[2815.12 → 2819.40] So I actually was going to do an underclocking video on NCI Tech Tips like way back in the
[2819.40 → 2819.52] day.
[2819.56 → 2820.42] You might have been around for that.
[2820.50 → 2820.74] Mm-hmm.
[2820.92 → 2823.28] And we didn't do it because they're like, it wasn't great.
[2823.44 → 2823.60] Yeah.
[2825.64 → 2827.44] Arthur says, why was Luke getting fat?
[2827.54 → 2828.18] Did he get married?
[2828.82 → 2829.12] Nope.
[2830.58 → 2830.90] Joey.
[2831.06 → 2831.64] Hey, Linus and Luke.
[2831.68 → 2832.14] Love the show.
[2832.20 → 2834.04] When are we going to see the next video about the mineral oil PC?
[2834.18 → 2835.50] Actually, it won't be mineral oil.
[2835.66 → 2836.12] This is cool.
[2836.50 → 2838.04] There's a new competitor to Florida.
[2838.04 → 2838.26] Are you doing it?
[2838.26 → 2838.30] Right.
[2839.40 → 2841.78] A new competitor to 3M solution that's much cheaper.
[2841.92 → 2842.32] Oh, I know.
[2842.48 → 2843.76] And so we want to do something custom.
[2843.94 → 2844.52] That's really cool.
[2844.54 → 2845.28] So we've got the CNC.
[2845.62 → 2849.10] We've got like actual, like we're working on an actual workshop next door.
[2849.22 → 2849.44] Yeah.
[2849.94 → 2851.00] It'll take some time.
[2851.08 → 2851.56] That's legit.
[2851.76 → 2852.20] Stay tuned.
[2852.20 → 2852.44] Okay.
[2852.56 → 2853.26] That's really cool.
[2855.26 → 2857.46] Gamer Live Presents says, finally, I'm able to watch live.
[2857.56 → 2858.52] I've been watching you for years.
[2858.62 → 2859.06] Thank you.
[2860.30 → 2861.10] You're welcome.
[2861.36 → 2862.22] And thank you.
[2862.98 → 2864.46] Vendetta says, please no more unboxing.
[2864.46 → 2865.46] Oh, it'll probably happen.
[2865.46 → 2875.44] Black Hawk Who says, seriously, watching the WAN show on an 82-inch screen from an 8-foot beanbag with my plus one because LTT is fun, no BS entertainment, goofy as hell.
[2875.68 → 2875.78] Heck yeah.
[2875.78 → 2877.16] It's certain not tech news anymore.
[2877.26 → 2877.50] No.
[2878.30 → 2880.98] I even acknowledged that on a recent episode of Tech Linked.
[2881.00 → 2884.52] I was like, yeah, because like the WAN show is just an hour of BS now.
[2886.18 → 2887.70] How many news topics did we do?
[2887.76 → 2888.02] It's fun.
[2888.02 → 2889.64] I was only just trying to be like nice to James.
[2889.64 → 2893.00] We flew through, I think, two of them at the very end.
[2893.00 → 2895.64] We didn't actually cover the one that's in the title.
[2896.58 → 2897.48] Did we not?
[2897.62 → 2897.84] No.
[2897.86 → 2898.80] What was the one in the title?
[2898.94 → 2900.42] It's the most interesting one.
[2900.44 → 2901.02] Oh, crap.
[2902.94 → 2905.88] Apple disabled Google.
[2905.88 → 2907.52] Apple slaps Facebook and Google.
[2907.78 → 2914.56] Their internal apps, they disabled them because they were using them to collect data that they're not supposed to per Apple's terms and conditions and user agreement.
[2915.12 → 2918.58] And then Facebook and Google said, yep, oops, are bad.
[2918.66 → 2921.96] And then Apple re-enabled them, and they're going to fix them.
[2922.36 → 2922.76] Good.
[2923.00 → 2924.08] I think it's perfect.
[2924.20 → 2924.70] Yeah, it's perfect.
[2924.70 → 2930.56] Honestly, the more of these news articles that come out, the more likely the next phone I get is going to be an Apple, which is weird.
[2931.90 → 2932.26] Really?
[2932.48 → 2932.72] Yeah.
[2932.84 → 2933.34] I'm not even kidding.
[2933.48 → 2934.18] Security reasons.
[2935.82 → 2937.54] I do so much work stuff on my phone.
[2938.20 → 2941.30] And like they're generally better for security reasons.
[2943.44 → 2945.28] Joe Riccio says, thank you.
[2945.54 → 2946.38] Thank you, too.
[2946.38 → 2950.06] Scrapyard Wars odd job.
[2950.68 → 2952.38] Funding from odd jobs, yard keeping, etc.
[2952.50 → 2954.04] We have literally made that video.
[2954.48 → 2955.28] RWX lone wolf.
[2955.28 → 2959.94] I think it's called laptop robust.
[2959.94 → 2960.24] Laptop robust.
[2960.38 → 2960.56] Yeah.
[2960.86 → 2962.28] I know that was the internal name.
[2962.30 → 2963.66] Yeah, I don't know if we ended up calling it that.
[2963.74 → 2963.94] Yeah.
[2965.24 → 2966.04] I'm going to look it up.
[2966.04 → 2976.42] Wes says, where can I send a longer message concerning LTT's possible first person view RC element?
[2976.66 → 2977.66] Also, I work at a hobby shop.
[2978.46 → 2979.74] Linus Tech Tips at gmail.com.
[2979.74 → 2984.34] We have had a few people reach out to help us with that already, though, so I'm not sure what the deal is.
[2984.90 → 2988.40] Hector says, Hector from Sewell, our sponsor, sent another $10.
[2989.58 → 2992.20] You already paid for the exposure on the show.
[2992.74 → 2995.56] For some reason, the Amazon code has not updated.
[2995.96 → 2997.74] Should be ready by the time the show ends.
[2997.94 → 2999.44] For sure works on the Sewell Direct site.
[2999.60 → 3000.14] Oh, okay.
[3000.26 → 3001.00] Well, that's good to know.
[3001.08 → 3001.28] Okay.
[3002.80 → 3008.20] Marcus says, have you ever been propositioned by someone due to being an online personality?
[3008.64 → 3008.86] Yeah.
[3009.26 → 3009.58] Really?
[3010.40 → 3011.26] I haven't.
[3011.70 → 3012.02] Oh.
[3012.16 → 3012.48] Ouch.
[3015.68 → 3016.10] Uh-uh.
[3016.10 → 3023.42] Maybe they're being courteous.
[3023.42 → 3023.74] You know what?
[3023.82 → 3024.48] I think that's enough.
[3024.48 → 3025.32] They knew you were married.
[3025.32 → 3026.24] They knew you were married.
[3026.36 → 3027.26] They're just being nice.
[3027.26 → 3045.88] Oh, boy.
[3045.88 → 3049.88] Oh, boy.
[3049.88 → 3051.26] I think that's enough.
[3051.26 → 3051.72] Okay.
[3051.72 → 3052.38] I don't know.
[3052.38 → 3052.58] I don't know.
[3052.58 → 3052.98] Oh, boy.
[3052.98 → 3053.44] I don't know.
[3053.44 → 3054.16] I don't know.
[3054.16 → 3054.76] I don't know.
[3054.76 → 3055.50] Oh, boy.
