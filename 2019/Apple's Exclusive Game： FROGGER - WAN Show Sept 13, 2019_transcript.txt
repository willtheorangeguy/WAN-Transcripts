[0.00 --> 7.66]  Oh, it's WAN Showtime, alright, and we're not even that late today.
[7.84 --> 10.08]  We are nine minutes late.
[10.32 --> 10.94]  Well, sort of.
[11.08 --> 11.90]  Yeah, eight minutes.
[12.04 --> 12.56]  Eight minutes!
[12.96 --> 15.52]  We actually had a pretty fun day today.
[15.72 --> 16.06]  We did.
[16.60 --> 26.56]  We spent the last hour and a half gaming together in multiplayer.
[27.56 --> 28.08]  Yes.
[30.00 --> 34.88]  On the Nintendo Virtual Boy.
[35.34 --> 35.62]  Yeah!
[36.82 --> 38.16]  So that's going to be a video.
[38.24 --> 44.36]  We're going to talk about it a little bit later because I don't know about you, but my headache is actually getting worse.
[45.48 --> 48.94]  I don't think mine's getting worse, but I'm still extremely aware of it.
[49.08 --> 52.20]  Yeah, it is not a great experience.
[52.32 --> 52.46]  No.
[52.60 --> 55.34]  Except for the parts of it that are absolutely outstanding.
[55.44 --> 55.76]  Yes.
[55.76 --> 63.82]  It's, man, I don't know what to say about it other than if you're here for the news about Apple's event this week, then...
[63.82 --> 64.68]  We'll get right into that.
[64.76 --> 66.20]  Haven't you had enough?
[66.38 --> 68.00]  And you should, yeah.
[68.00 --> 68.08]  Yeah.
[68.36 --> 74.06]  So we'll talk about some of the iPhone stuff and also there's a new iPad and blah, blah, blah.
[74.16 --> 81.14]  But really, I want to talk about the Apple Arcade service a little bit more and what this means for gaming in general, mobile gaming in particular.
[81.72 --> 82.72]  What else we got today?
[82.72 --> 90.56]  There's the new Switch fit game, which is important for reasons that we'll get more into later.
[90.84 --> 91.08]  Yeah.
[91.90 --> 97.56]  And SpaceX is deploying satellite broadband across the U.S. next year, which might mean in the next five years.
[98.70 --> 99.40]  Or never.
[99.84 --> 100.70]  Yeah, or that.
[100.78 --> 102.86]  Also, I ditched my OLED TV at home.
[103.38 --> 103.62]  Oh.
[103.72 --> 105.28]  What could have inspired me to do such a thing?
[106.00 --> 106.78]  You'll find out.
[106.80 --> 107.22]  Oh my.
[107.32 --> 109.52]  After you sit through this ancient intro.
[110.58 --> 111.06]  Oh.
[111.78 --> 112.54]  It's broken.
[113.06 --> 113.72]  It's good.
[114.02 --> 114.46]  Yeah.
[115.34 --> 119.10]  I still own that sweater, technically.
[120.20 --> 121.46]  I still own that shirt.
[121.72 --> 122.10]  Nice.
[127.26 --> 129.04]  We're extremely fashionable people.
[129.22 --> 129.52]  Yeah.
[130.90 --> 133.74]  Which is why you should buy merch at LTTstore.com.
[133.80 --> 134.18]  Yes.
[134.18 --> 137.34]  That stuff is actually everything that I own that's fashionable.
[137.88 --> 138.78]  Just gonna say.
[139.08 --> 140.66]  I think fashionable is a strong word.
[140.94 --> 141.90]  This looks fashionable.
[142.90 --> 143.20]  Yeah.
[144.60 --> 146.38]  That's better than most of my stuff.
[146.76 --> 148.00]  No, I meant literally clean.
[148.26 --> 148.48]  Oh.
[148.88 --> 149.66]  This is also literally clean.
[149.66 --> 149.96]  Yeah, yeah.
[149.96 --> 151.44]  You just put on what's clean, though.
[151.76 --> 152.26]  That's my...
[152.26 --> 153.78]  That's kind of where I was going with it.
[153.78 --> 154.46]  Don't worry about it.
[154.46 --> 154.68]  Yes.
[154.96 --> 155.64]  I mean...
[155.64 --> 157.88]  That is how my fashion sense works.
[157.88 --> 161.62]  Actually, aren't you basically down to stuff that fits at all at this point?
[162.10 --> 163.42]  Because of the washer-dryers situation?
[163.42 --> 163.64]  Yeah, yeah.
[163.68 --> 164.08]  Why don't we...
[164.08 --> 164.96]  Why don't we...
[164.96 --> 165.10]  Okay.
[165.78 --> 166.12]  You know what?
[166.16 --> 167.50]  We can do one off-topic thing.
[167.56 --> 168.38]  Then we'll talk about the Apple thing.
[168.38 --> 168.74]  I promise.
[169.06 --> 171.20]  My dad is a plumbing instructor, and he doesn't understand.
[171.44 --> 172.64]  So just...
[172.64 --> 175.26]  I want to put that out there first, because it's really weird.
[175.42 --> 179.84]  Your dad also is responsible for whole room water-cooling the plumbing behind it.
[179.84 --> 180.32]  That's fair.
[180.42 --> 181.72]  That was my spec, though.
[182.06 --> 182.42]  Yeah.
[182.96 --> 184.46]  He did tell me it was stupid.
[184.72 --> 185.12]  Oh, did he?
[185.32 --> 185.68]  Oh, yeah.
[185.80 --> 186.08]  Okay.
[186.08 --> 186.90]  It's your dad.
[186.98 --> 188.42]  You think he didn't tell me it was stupid?
[188.62 --> 189.24]  That's fair.
[189.26 --> 190.36]  He was very clear.
[193.48 --> 195.22]  Luke's dad's a badass, basically.
[195.38 --> 195.58]  Yeah.
[195.80 --> 196.00]  Yeah.
[196.68 --> 201.10]  But I brought him over to try to figure this out, because my sink in my bathroom at home,
[201.30 --> 204.10]  if I turn on one tap, one day it might be cold.
[204.42 --> 205.84]  The next day, it might be warm.
[205.84 --> 208.80]  If I turn on the other one, it's the opposite of what...
[208.80 --> 210.54]  But, like, they rotate randomly.
[210.86 --> 214.34]  And that happens to every tap in the house.
[214.42 --> 216.04]  So Luke lives in a condo, just to be clear.
[216.26 --> 216.42]  Yeah.
[216.42 --> 216.48]  Yeah.
[216.56 --> 217.12]  Not a house.
[217.20 --> 217.32]  Yeah.
[217.96 --> 225.40]  If I have a shower, if it's at, like, 3 to 7 in the morning, it is always maximum heat,
[225.46 --> 226.72]  no matter what I do.
[226.90 --> 231.12]  But I have found out that I can trick it a little bit by turning on random taps in the
[231.12 --> 231.42]  house.
[231.42 --> 235.86]  And then sometimes it will flip to maximum cold only.
[236.04 --> 237.30]  There's no other options.
[237.64 --> 238.86]  Later parts of the day, it's okay.
[238.96 --> 242.46]  But, yeah, you can put it on maximum cold, and it's like, nope, I'm fully hot.
[242.70 --> 248.48]  Anyways, this becomes a problem when, you know, all the water sources are affected, and you
[248.48 --> 251.52]  get to the washer-dryer, because you put it on cold.
[251.52 --> 252.42]  The dryer's fine.
[252.62 --> 252.86]  Yeah.
[253.00 --> 253.98]  The dryer is no problem.
[253.98 --> 258.00]  But you put the washing machine on cold, and your clothes come out steaming.
[258.44 --> 260.58]  And it's like, well, that wasn't intended.
[260.58 --> 264.86]  And then you wash some stuff that's the right size.
[265.04 --> 266.80]  And it's no longer the right size.
[266.94 --> 269.24]  Or you wash some stuff that's red.
[269.56 --> 272.36]  And now other things are also kind of red.
[273.64 --> 275.12]  Which I've never had to deal with.
[275.22 --> 276.68]  Are you sure you're not just an idiot?
[277.40 --> 277.64]  Yeah.
[278.32 --> 278.72]  Okay.
[278.92 --> 280.66]  The only reason why I'm going to defend this.
[280.66 --> 282.56]  Look, it does raise some questions.
[282.56 --> 282.90]  It's fair.
[282.90 --> 283.66]  You don't know which to happen.
[283.92 --> 283.98]  It's fair.
[284.08 --> 285.64]  Are you forgetting from day to day?
[286.08 --> 288.48]  My roommate and my girlfriend have experienced the same thing.
[288.48 --> 291.94]  Most of my friends that I've brought over being like, look, have experienced the same thing.
[291.94 --> 295.90]  Are you sure your roommate and your girlfriend and all your friends are not idiots?
[295.90 --> 296.86]  My girlfriend's not an idiot.
[296.88 --> 297.82]  Because I haven't been there.
[297.92 --> 300.78]  Myself and my roommate are maybe, maybe sometimes.
[301.70 --> 305.08]  But also, my dad has seen it, and it's blown his brain.
[305.12 --> 305.70]  I'm just teasing.
[305.70 --> 308.70]  He had a theory that the pipes are too close to each other.
[309.20 --> 311.16]  So the hot pipe might heat transfer.
[311.56 --> 315.36]  But that doesn't make sense because you shouldn't end up, you shouldn't be able to be hot.
[315.36 --> 315.54]  It shouldn't be swappable.
[315.54 --> 315.94]  Yeah.
[316.08 --> 318.18]  You should be able to have two warm taps.
[318.30 --> 319.56]  That was his initial theory.
[319.74 --> 322.96]  And by the time he left the house, he was like, I don't know.
[323.24 --> 323.70]  I'm done.
[324.06 --> 324.40]  I'm out.
[324.58 --> 324.76]  Yeah.
[325.22 --> 325.42]  Peace.
[325.64 --> 326.96]  Something weird's going on.
[328.52 --> 328.92]  Yeah.
[329.04 --> 330.46]  That was very odd.
[330.58 --> 333.52]  So a significant amount of my clothes don't fit anymore.
[333.52 --> 335.38]  So let's talk about the Apple event.
[335.46 --> 336.28]  Did you watch the keynote?
[336.58 --> 337.56]  I watched some of it.
[337.72 --> 338.26]  I was busy.
[338.34 --> 339.10]  That's more than I watched.
[339.14 --> 340.56]  It was during a work shift.
[340.56 --> 348.76]  I have legitimately gotten to the point where my CEO-ness is so inescapable that I actually
[348.76 --> 356.18]  assigned underlings, more than one underling, to watch the Apple event for me and then provide
[356.18 --> 357.12]  me with a summary.
[357.44 --> 358.60]  That's awesome.
[359.08 --> 360.20]  That is super legit.
[360.24 --> 362.20]  It's like an hour and a half.
[362.20 --> 364.18]  I don't have an hour and a half.
[364.24 --> 370.98]  Because the thing, too, is if you're going to watch it, you can't really just have it
[370.98 --> 373.92]  half on or you're going to miss the demos and stuff.
[374.52 --> 377.28]  Like if I'm watching an Apple event and I do sometimes.
[377.32 --> 378.32]  You can do it half on.
[378.44 --> 380.10]  I find it tough.
[380.30 --> 381.82]  Because, okay, well, hold on a second.
[382.32 --> 385.40]  Because I'm not talking about efficiency from like a personal standpoint.
[386.04 --> 388.94]  I'm talking about efficiency from a company-wide standpoint.
[388.94 --> 392.42]  If I'm watching it, then I'm going to watch it.
[392.82 --> 396.42]  Everyone else be doing your frigging work because I'm watching the Apple event.
[396.54 --> 398.14]  I'll let you know if anything interesting happens.
[398.56 --> 404.46]  If I'm not watching it, then someone else needs to be watching it and making notes and
[404.46 --> 405.06]  filling me in.
[405.18 --> 409.28]  If I am half watching it, then I'm going to miss stuff.
[409.64 --> 411.16]  And so I can't fill in anyone.
[411.16 --> 415.12]  And they can't fill in me because I'm clearly not like making detailed notes as I go.
[415.40 --> 420.26]  So I might as well be filming a completely different video, which is exactly what I was
[420.26 --> 420.50]  doing.
[420.80 --> 422.74]  And someone else can just tell me about it.
[422.88 --> 425.58]  I had a call like midway through it.
[425.78 --> 428.60]  So I couldn't really watch it properly at all.
[428.60 --> 434.54]  And then when it wasn't the call, I had it on like a side monitor, but I was super focused
[434.54 --> 435.48]  on other things.
[435.64 --> 437.92]  So like I got some vague stuff.
[438.08 --> 442.68]  I was roughly trying to pay attention to the iPad things because my mom needs an iPad for
[442.68 --> 443.00]  work.
[443.12 --> 445.08]  So I was like, is there an iPad coming?
[445.56 --> 445.86]  Yes.
[446.32 --> 447.84]  Is it reasonably priced?
[447.96 --> 448.66]  Is it sort of okay?
[448.68 --> 449.42]  Actually, yes.
[449.54 --> 450.70]  Seems great.
[450.82 --> 450.94]  Yeah.
[450.98 --> 452.50]  New iPad actually looks great.
[452.66 --> 452.82]  Yeah.
[452.90 --> 455.70]  Well, it's even more great because she was going to buy one.
[455.70 --> 458.78]  And I was like, wait, don't because they're probably going to release one and they're
[458.78 --> 460.32]  probably going to price replace it.
[460.42 --> 462.34]  She was like, okay, waited like three days.
[462.36 --> 463.20]  And then the announcement came.
[463.40 --> 463.60]  Woo!
[463.94 --> 464.58]  It was awesome.
[465.18 --> 466.86]  So yeah, there's a new entry level iPad.
[467.06 --> 467.82]  It has thinner bezels.
[467.96 --> 468.94]  It's 330 bucks.
[469.08 --> 473.56]  The iPhone 11 is basically a 10R, but like more, more better.
[474.48 --> 478.98]  So they changed the naming scheme, which is annoying, but they probably improved the naming
[478.98 --> 479.34]  scheme.
[479.34 --> 480.74]  I think they really did.
[480.82 --> 483.34]  There's a lot of people making fun of them for Pro Max.
[483.42 --> 484.08]  Even we did.
[484.08 --> 487.14]  It sounds like a protein supplement or something.
[487.38 --> 487.60]  Yes.
[487.66 --> 488.16]  It does.
[488.16 --> 491.90]  It sounds like something you can buy in a bottle that's this big.
[492.14 --> 493.18]  Like it might have a handle on it.
[493.18 --> 497.08]  But that has six servings in it because you're supposed to eat so much of it.
[498.36 --> 503.74]  David was showing me this gigantic bottle of protein cheesy poofs that he has.
[504.70 --> 505.92]  And I'm like, so I ate one.
[505.98 --> 508.08]  I'm like, yeah, I got some protein or something.
[508.18 --> 510.36]  He's like, yeah, it's probably not that much.
[510.48 --> 512.38]  And it was literally, hey, David.
[512.38 --> 514.96]  David, how much was in each cheesy poof?
[515.06 --> 516.66]  Like one gram or something?
[516.84 --> 518.48]  Less than a gram.
[519.44 --> 524.64]  So you'd have to eat like handfuls of this stuff in order to actually take in like an
[524.64 --> 526.12]  appreciable amount of protein.
[526.94 --> 528.56]  Like it sounds like something like that.
[528.56 --> 536.64]  But honestly, iPhone 11 as the basic now, which I guess, I don't know if they did that on
[536.64 --> 537.78]  purpose or by accident.
[540.24 --> 543.06]  I'm not sure, but I like it to be honest.
[543.12 --> 549.26]  Because the iPhone 8 was like the basic one when the iPhone 10 launched.
[549.34 --> 552.46]  It was like, okay, we'll just buy the last gen one then.
[552.46 --> 555.24]  The Max branding has existed for a long time.
[555.38 --> 556.08]  So, okay.
[558.42 --> 560.78]  And then we've got Pro.
[561.30 --> 564.80]  Pro made sense like a thousand years ago.
[564.86 --> 570.60]  They probably just should have called the iPhone 10 the iPhone 8 Pro.
[570.60 --> 571.38]  Yeah.
[572.06 --> 574.92]  Like then we could have just skipped all this crap.
[575.94 --> 577.50]  Actually, that would have worked perfectly.
[577.68 --> 582.16]  We could have had an iPhone 10 Pro, an iPhone 9 Pro, and an iPhone now 11 Pro.
[582.40 --> 583.50]  I completely agree.
[583.72 --> 586.56]  But I'm going to jump slightly on the other side.
[586.66 --> 587.68]  It's not actually the other side.
[588.24 --> 589.86]  I'm going to adjust my position on this side.
[589.98 --> 591.02]  I don't know how to call it.
[591.18 --> 591.44]  There you go.
[591.44 --> 591.62]  Whoa.
[591.80 --> 591.98]  Okay.
[592.04 --> 592.34]  There we go.
[592.34 --> 592.74]  Position adjustment.
[592.74 --> 597.82]  We always hammer on people for terrible naming schemes.
[597.94 --> 598.14]  We do.
[598.36 --> 600.82]  And I feel extremely justified every time.
[601.18 --> 601.88]  Yeah, because they're bad.
[601.88 --> 602.74]  Because they are terrible.
[602.86 --> 603.26]  They're terrible.
[603.36 --> 604.28]  And they should feel bad about it.
[604.28 --> 605.18]  Intel, are you watching?
[605.38 --> 605.68]  Yes.
[605.76 --> 606.64]  You should feel bad.
[606.76 --> 607.06]  Yes.
[607.14 --> 608.16]  NVIDIA, are you watching?
[608.34 --> 608.52]  Yes.
[608.54 --> 609.64]  You should feel super.
[611.72 --> 612.58]  Super bad.
[612.72 --> 612.92]  Yeah.
[613.76 --> 613.96]  Yeah.
[614.62 --> 616.74]  This time, I agree.
[617.10 --> 618.10]  They could have done it better.
[618.30 --> 619.14]  All this other kind of stuff.
[619.30 --> 620.14]  But they did it.
[620.24 --> 621.42]  And I prefer it this way.
[621.54 --> 621.78]  Yes.
[621.78 --> 623.12]  So I want to make sure that they...
[623.12 --> 624.02]  Rip the band-aid off.
[624.10 --> 624.30]  Yeah.
[624.56 --> 625.32]  Do it right.
[625.48 --> 625.68]  Yeah.
[625.82 --> 631.40]  And to Apple's credit, I think the iPhone is one of the few things in their lineup that
[631.40 --> 633.70]  has a naming scheme that I can get behind.
[634.08 --> 637.54]  Because the problem that I have with their other stuff, where on the surface it makes
[637.54 --> 637.80]  sense.
[637.86 --> 638.46]  You've got the MacBook.
[638.70 --> 639.74]  You've got the MacBook Pro.
[640.06 --> 643.46]  This one is for people who want to browse Facebook.
[643.64 --> 646.52]  And this one is for people who want to browse Facebook but look like a baller while
[646.52 --> 646.90]  they do it.
[648.20 --> 650.50]  So you've got this clear segmentation.
[650.50 --> 656.94]  But the issue is that with the MacBook, they refuse to differentiate the models year by
[656.94 --> 657.22]  year.
[657.56 --> 661.54]  So with the iPhone, they have finally got it down.
[662.08 --> 665.06]  The suffixes make sense.
[665.44 --> 668.60]  The generation of the product is clear.
[668.80 --> 669.00]  Yeah.
[669.00 --> 671.78]  And I applaud.
[671.88 --> 673.06]  That's not even a slow clap.
[673.44 --> 673.84]  Sorry.
[674.10 --> 674.36]  Sorry.
[674.56 --> 674.70]  Yeah.
[674.74 --> 675.60]  That was probably horrible.
[675.66 --> 676.04]  I'm sorry.
[676.18 --> 676.70]  I applaud.
[676.86 --> 677.24]  I applaud.
[678.14 --> 678.72]  There you go.
[678.78 --> 679.28]  Very nice.
[679.40 --> 680.86]  Now I look like the monkey with the...
[680.86 --> 681.28]  Yeah.
[681.72 --> 681.84]  Yeah.
[681.84 --> 684.34]  Oh, jeez.
[685.66 --> 686.18]  So yeah.
[686.22 --> 686.66]  Good job.
[687.36 --> 688.62]  The notch is still here.
[688.78 --> 689.42]  That I applaud.
[689.56 --> 689.94]  Less.
[691.50 --> 691.90]  Yeah.
[692.90 --> 693.26]  Yeah.
[696.06 --> 698.04]  Finally, thicker phones with bigger batteries.
[698.54 --> 699.28]  That I applaud.
[699.28 --> 699.72]  Again.
[699.94 --> 700.28]  Real applause.
[700.28 --> 700.66]  Real applause.
[700.66 --> 701.58]  This is weird applause.
[701.70 --> 702.30]  I know, right?
[702.40 --> 703.30]  Apple's like doing things right.
[703.34 --> 704.22]  No USB-C.
[704.42 --> 705.88]  That gets less applause.
[706.84 --> 708.58]  The Watch Series 5 hasn't always on display.
[708.68 --> 711.30]  I feel like I covered that in my coverage of this.
[711.80 --> 713.76]  I want to talk about the Apple Arcade subscription.
[715.18 --> 722.18]  So there is no shortage of companies that are trying to get into gaming as a service.
[722.72 --> 724.18]  You've got Microsoft.
[724.54 --> 725.94]  You've got Ubisoft.
[726.26 --> 727.54]  You've got EA.
[727.54 --> 733.02]  You've got every sort of free-to-play Battle Royale developer.
[733.38 --> 735.56]  So you've got Epic.
[735.66 --> 739.00]  Everyone wants you to subscribe to a season of a game.
[739.32 --> 743.36]  Or to subscribe to a package of games that you have access to.
[743.46 --> 745.78]  You've got NVIDIA with their...
[745.78 --> 747.38]  What do they call it?
[749.00 --> 750.10]  I don't remember.
[750.28 --> 750.76]  Game Stream?
[750.94 --> 751.32]  Is it...
[751.32 --> 751.64]  No.
[751.74 --> 754.38]  I thought Game Stream was just like...
[754.38 --> 756.16]  Game Now?
[756.26 --> 756.70]  GeForce Now.
[756.86 --> 757.40]  GeForce Now.
[757.54 --> 758.84]  Do they still call it that, though?
[759.58 --> 759.76]  Yeah.
[759.86 --> 760.36]  GeForce Now.
[760.76 --> 761.12]  I think.
[761.50 --> 761.68]  Whatever.
[761.80 --> 762.20]  Doesn't matter.
[762.36 --> 762.66]  Who cares?
[763.00 --> 764.20]  So you've got NVIDIA's thing.
[765.04 --> 765.94]  Where they're...
[765.94 --> 766.94]  So where all the games...
[766.94 --> 768.92]  And there's all these different ways to tackle it, right?
[768.96 --> 773.96]  So you've got individual games where they want you to buy a season's worth of cosmetics
[773.96 --> 777.44]  or upgrades or DLC or whatever the case may be.
[778.00 --> 779.38]  Yeah, like Borderlands after they said they wouldn't.
[779.60 --> 779.78]  Yeah.
[779.86 --> 785.46]  You've got game publishers like your Ubisofts and your EAs of the world that want you to
[785.46 --> 788.00]  just buy a subscription to their game launcher...
[788.00 --> 788.28]  Yes.
[788.40 --> 793.02]  ...that gives you all the hottest titles or some of the hottest titles or some pretty hot titles
[793.02 --> 794.62]  and then you could buy that other stuff too.
[795.02 --> 798.48]  So that you feel like you've got a compelling package of games to play and it's constantly
[798.48 --> 799.34]  being refreshed.
[799.34 --> 805.84]  This way you are paying for access to the software but you don't necessarily own the software.
[805.96 --> 808.12]  Game developers want to get away from that paradigm.
[808.52 --> 809.48]  Dedicated servers.
[809.72 --> 809.94]  Ha!
[810.56 --> 813.52]  Patches that you can just like download and install on your own.
[813.68 --> 814.02]  Ha ha!
[814.42 --> 818.72]  Discs that have like the software loaded on it so that maybe you could still play it in
[818.72 --> 819.80]  10 or 20 years.
[820.06 --> 820.26]  Ha!
[820.42 --> 821.06]  What an idiot.
[821.24 --> 821.70]  You're an idiot.
[822.64 --> 826.82]  Then you've got Microsoft where they've got sort of a combination of both.
[826.82 --> 831.28]  They want you to pay for like online access in general so you can like multiplayer game.
[831.74 --> 836.06]  And then you've got also you want they want you to pay for like more much more premium
[836.06 --> 839.30]  version so that you can have all these games that you can access.
[840.26 --> 845.28]  Then you've got the services like GeForce Now where you're paying for just access to games
[845.28 --> 848.90]  and also access to not have to pay for your own hardware.
[849.02 --> 851.74]  So that's something that Google is also targeting with Stadia.
[852.56 --> 856.42]  So it's like a subscription to hardware that lives in a data center and it streams to you.
[856.82 --> 859.96]  So Apple's approach is completely different.
[860.70 --> 868.18]  So what they're doing is they're taking some of what's good about other approaches like
[868.18 --> 875.46]  this Netflix model where you've got a constant stream of revenue that supports further gaming
[875.46 --> 875.86]  development.
[875.86 --> 882.98]  So it could be refreshed titles or added content to the games that are already in the library.
[883.12 --> 886.88]  So you've got this this revenue model that quite frankly makes way more sense for game
[886.88 --> 887.34]  developers.
[887.74 --> 893.72]  But unlike services like Stadia or GeForce Now where it's streaming from a server it runs
[893.72 --> 894.78]  on your local device.
[894.78 --> 906.78]  But unlike services like those you'd find from EA or Ubisoft it is not like AAA titles that are
[906.78 --> 908.86]  being sort of bundled into this service.
[908.86 --> 910.48]  It's mobile games.
[910.48 --> 914.18]  So what's your gut reaction to this?
[914.30 --> 916.76]  They're going to have a hundred plus games right out of the bat.
[916.84 --> 918.28]  They've worked with third party developers.
[918.74 --> 921.22]  It's five dollars a month after the first month.
[921.36 --> 925.32]  It's dare I say reasonably priced.
[925.62 --> 925.74]  Yeah.
[925.74 --> 929.16]  Where's the Apple tax here?
[929.24 --> 934.70]  I was going to say honestly if usually if I want a game on my phone it's because I'm stuck
[934.70 --> 935.10]  somewhere.
[935.58 --> 936.90]  I don't have access to my Switch.
[937.28 --> 938.62]  I don't have access to my laptop.
[939.26 --> 940.70]  I don't have access to my desktop.
[941.28 --> 945.90]  So I'm caught waiting for something probably for like a couple hours and there's nothing
[945.90 --> 946.40]  to do.
[946.70 --> 952.60]  I'm just on my phone and I'm tired of Twitter now and I've done all the work I can do on
[952.60 --> 953.80]  my phone and whatever else.
[953.80 --> 958.14]  And I look through my phone and I go I don't really want to play anything.
[958.78 --> 960.32]  I check the free to play section of the store.
[960.68 --> 965.66]  This all looks like cancer and free to the transactions and all this kind of stuff.
[965.86 --> 969.76]  So being able to just pay five bucks and have a bunch of games and there's no more microtransactions
[969.76 --> 971.42]  that sounds like a very reasonable solution.
[971.58 --> 978.22]  That's the beauty of it to me is that Apple is taking a subgenre of gaming that I think a
[978.22 --> 983.48]  lot of more traditional gamers like you and me are quite dismissive of because I find
[983.48 --> 985.12]  the experience really frustrating.
[985.32 --> 986.46]  Like what do you, sorry what?
[986.54 --> 993.94]  I can't, I can't play the next level until I wait eight hours or buy some like, I don't
[993.94 --> 996.02]  know, you know, stupid silver.
[996.14 --> 997.94]  I like games where progression.
[997.94 --> 1000.04]  Sparkly uranium tokens or whatever.
[1000.04 --> 1004.22]  I like games where progression is either skill or effort.
[1004.94 --> 1005.32]  Sure.
[1005.48 --> 1006.40]  I'm down with either of those.
[1006.40 --> 1009.20]  If it's like, oh, I just wait or oh, I just pay money.
[1009.34 --> 1010.92]  It's like, okay, neither of those things are interesting.
[1010.96 --> 1013.78]  Both of those things really pull me out of the experience.
[1013.84 --> 1014.02]  Yes.
[1014.28 --> 1016.12]  They're, they're, they're, they're non-immersive.
[1016.24 --> 1022.38]  They, they make me acutely aware that what I'm doing right now is quite literally wasting
[1022.38 --> 1022.88]  time.
[1023.04 --> 1023.38]  Yes.
[1023.38 --> 1027.44]  I am, I am actually actively waiting.
[1027.90 --> 1028.24]  Yes.
[1028.36 --> 1029.90]  I am, I'm watching paint dry.
[1030.00 --> 1031.32]  It's, it's not a great experience.
[1031.32 --> 1037.48]  And Apple has clearly identified this problem with the gaming platform that they have identified
[1037.48 --> 1039.02]  as their future in gaming.
[1039.14 --> 1045.62]  Apple has made no move to make macOS more of a gaming centric platform.
[1045.62 --> 1049.70]  So iOS is the way forward for them.
[1049.70 --> 1054.60]  And to their credit, iOS gets a ton of attention from gaming developers.
[1054.78 --> 1060.62]  It is generating a ton of revenue for game, well, game developers and Apple themselves.
[1060.62 --> 1069.22]  Like it is by any measure a successful business, but what it is, is a pretty crappy gaming experience.
[1069.22 --> 1077.38]  So they've identified this problem and created a solution that now, even if game developers
[1077.38 --> 1081.34]  aren't leveraging individually, they now have to compete with.
[1081.66 --> 1081.74]  Yeah.
[1081.86 --> 1087.72]  They have to compete with the idea that for $5 a month with no microtransactions, you
[1087.72 --> 1092.62]  can just have a library of mobile games to play on your iPad or your iOS.
[1092.76 --> 1093.46]  And shared with.
[1093.46 --> 1095.02]  Or your iOS, on your iPad or your iPhone.
[1095.24 --> 1097.04]  And shared with five family members.
[1097.04 --> 1097.74]  Yeah.
[1097.82 --> 1102.86]  So it's basically, if you can find five family members or five friends even, and get one
[1102.86 --> 1105.08]  subscription, it's a dollar a month.
[1105.26 --> 1105.56]  Yeah.
[1105.74 --> 1108.06]  That is like not a lot.
[1108.22 --> 1108.60]  No.
[1110.54 --> 1112.52]  If you have a modern iPhone.
[1112.80 --> 1113.06]  Yeah.
[1113.26 --> 1114.68]  You can probably afford that.
[1114.68 --> 1119.48]  I had people saying in the chat here that they're like, if it's not free, I'm not interested.
[1120.34 --> 1122.16]  A dollar a month is like.
[1122.16 --> 1123.16]  That's the whole problem.
[1123.42 --> 1126.24]  That's the whole reason why mobile games are terrible.
[1126.52 --> 1126.80]  Yes.
[1127.36 --> 1128.78]  I hate that mentality.
[1129.12 --> 1130.86]  I actually really hate that mentality.
[1131.22 --> 1134.08]  Every, like, for a while there, when a whole bunch of MMOs were coming out.
[1134.10 --> 1134.24]  Yeah.
[1134.38 --> 1136.18]  Like Elder Scrolls Online and all that other kind of stuff.
[1136.48 --> 1139.80]  Every single time, when they hadn't announced if it was free to play or not, I was like,
[1140.10 --> 1141.54]  please be subscription based.
[1142.14 --> 1144.30]  Because if it's free to play, it will be trash.
[1144.48 --> 1146.36]  And it happens every time.
[1146.46 --> 1147.82]  I absolutely hate that.
[1148.16 --> 1149.90]  There is room for some free games.
[1150.58 --> 1151.32]  League of Legends works.
[1151.32 --> 1151.42]  Sure.
[1151.82 --> 1152.00]  Yep.
[1152.00 --> 1153.86]  There are other games that work as well.
[1154.14 --> 1154.34]  Yep.
[1154.34 --> 1160.72]  But, like, on a whole, especially with mobile games, they're built to manipulate you.
[1160.98 --> 1164.44]  They're built to be a waiting game where they hit you with dopamine so you just keep waiting.
[1164.72 --> 1166.32]  But you're not, like, accomplishing anything.
[1166.44 --> 1167.10]  There's no skill.
[1167.20 --> 1167.80]  There's no effort.
[1167.90 --> 1168.60]  All this kind of stuff.
[1168.90 --> 1175.38]  It's just, oh, I set an alarm so that I could wake up exactly when this thing finished building or whatever.
[1175.64 --> 1179.56]  And then I could press the button twice and then I went back to sleep.
[1179.98 --> 1187.36]  I was really enjoying this Tiny Tower game until I reached that point in the game where it was like, yeah, they expect me to, what is this?
[1187.56 --> 1189.82]  Like, 90s TV?
[1190.38 --> 1193.26]  Like, I have to schedule my life around content?
[1193.40 --> 1193.64]  Yeah.
[1193.64 --> 1194.96]  Like, excuse me?
[1195.12 --> 1195.38]  Yeah.
[1196.62 --> 1197.38]  And then, like...
[1197.38 --> 1198.66]  What freaking year is it?
[1198.72 --> 1199.60]  Little mobile game.
[1199.98 --> 1205.16]  Like, there's room for that kind of stuff, but I hate the mentality of if it isn't free, I'm not interested.
[1205.38 --> 1205.86]  So...
[1205.86 --> 1207.86]  If you don't have the money, I totally get that.
[1207.92 --> 1215.66]  But there's great games out there, like TF2, like League of Legends, that you can go play that are still that other style.
[1216.04 --> 1219.06]  But that's not the most popular version of free games.
[1219.06 --> 1221.60]  I just need to, you know, especially on a phone.
[1221.60 --> 1224.84]  So, I mean, obviously the title of this video.
[1225.12 --> 1226.98]  I'm making fun of Apple a little bit.
[1227.06 --> 1228.94]  For one of their exclusive titles.
[1229.24 --> 1229.34]  Sure.
[1229.34 --> 1233.12]  So the games in this Apple Arcade will be Apple exclusive.
[1233.78 --> 1236.12]  One of their exclusive titles being Frogger.
[1237.52 --> 1237.88]  Really?
[1238.36 --> 1239.54]  It looks like a pretty cool Frogger.
[1239.84 --> 1240.02]  Okay.
[1240.32 --> 1240.54]  Okay.
[1240.68 --> 1242.18]  No, Konami developed it.
[1242.62 --> 1243.30]  Like, it's...
[1243.30 --> 1243.60]  Okay.
[1243.60 --> 1245.32]  Yeah, it's Frogger, but like, more better.
[1245.32 --> 1250.94]  Um, but in all seriousness, I am actually really happy about this.
[1251.60 --> 1258.52]  Because every once in a while, you know, whether it's pushing the industry towards caring more about color accuracy in displays.
[1258.78 --> 1261.08]  Or pixel density in displays.
[1262.04 --> 1262.64]  Apple leads.
[1262.64 --> 1264.30]  Or whatever else.
[1264.30 --> 1270.10]  Apple will make a move that forces the entire rest of the industry to react.
[1270.52 --> 1279.10]  And this is the kind of thing that the developer of a game that runs on an Android device might look at this and not care.
[1279.50 --> 1282.82]  But Google has to pay attention to this.
[1282.82 --> 1290.70]  And if Google reacts in some way that puts pressure on Android developers, that will be a net positive for gamers everywhere.
[1291.52 --> 1292.74]  So, I'm a fan.
[1292.92 --> 1294.94]  Yeah, speaking of net positive, they copied Link.
[1295.88 --> 1296.48]  Oh, yeah.
[1296.56 --> 1297.30]  I saw that.
[1297.96 --> 1298.40]  Shoot.
[1298.52 --> 1302.78]  I don't think our screen share to you is working right now.
[1302.84 --> 1304.48]  So I'm just going to bring up the thing.
[1304.74 --> 1305.06]  Yeah.
[1305.28 --> 1308.52]  Yeah, basically one of the games has Link as a character.
[1308.82 --> 1309.36]  And it's...
[1309.36 --> 1310.18]  They should be embarrassed.
[1310.18 --> 1313.96]  There's also, like, Lego Brawls looks like it could be really cool, actually.
[1314.12 --> 1315.76]  It's a multiplayer, like, fighting game.
[1315.86 --> 1316.76]  Yeah, that looks pretty sweet.
[1317.10 --> 1317.36]  Yeah.
[1317.52 --> 1317.90]  Here we go.
[1317.96 --> 1318.68]  This is the site.
[1319.06 --> 1319.74]  Oh, it was Link.
[1320.26 --> 1321.34]  I saw Link for a second there.
[1321.36 --> 1322.34]  If you scroll down, you can find it.
[1322.34 --> 1323.06]  Yeah, if I...
[1323.06 --> 1323.96]  Hold on.
[1324.30 --> 1327.06]  We'll find the dedicated big picture of Link.
[1327.82 --> 1329.60]  Games that redefine games.
[1329.78 --> 1330.12]  Okay.
[1330.52 --> 1331.98]  There's a few different Lego games, apparently.
[1332.14 --> 1333.42]  Lego Art House is another one.
[1333.52 --> 1337.74]  I do wonder if Tim Cook has ever played a game.
[1337.74 --> 1342.16]  Sonic Racing?
[1343.76 --> 1344.12]  Okay.
[1344.30 --> 1346.06]  So maybe some of it's going to be cringe.
[1346.74 --> 1350.10]  But there's a good chance that at least some of it will be good.
[1350.32 --> 1350.56]  Yeah.
[1350.96 --> 1351.82]  I'm going to try it out.
[1352.38 --> 1352.78]  Yeah.
[1352.86 --> 1353.12]  For sure.
[1353.44 --> 1353.66]  Yeah.
[1354.18 --> 1354.56]  All right.
[1354.62 --> 1355.26]  Next topic.
[1356.00 --> 1358.30]  Actually, this is really interesting.
[1358.30 --> 1363.32]  Because we just mentioned that one of the ways that you could get your Apple Arcade subscription
[1363.32 --> 1364.96]  for cheaper is by sharing it with friends.
[1365.42 --> 1368.32]  I mean, that's a paradigm that I'm sure you're well familiar with.
[1369.28 --> 1371.72]  He piggybacks on my Google Play Music subscription.
[1372.34 --> 1375.94]  I was actually looking at this and going, damn, it's only for five.
[1377.14 --> 1378.92]  I might not be able to be included.
[1378.92 --> 1382.34]  Maybe they're too young.
[1382.46 --> 1383.70]  Maybe I'll get some more years in it.
[1383.70 --> 1384.60]  You are such a doof.
[1387.48 --> 1389.76]  So Luke is technically in my family.
[1389.90 --> 1390.14]  Yeah.
[1390.28 --> 1391.26]  According to Google.
[1392.98 --> 1394.54]  Because he's in my family plan.
[1394.90 --> 1395.66]  I may have to.
[1395.72 --> 1396.64]  I'm at my max now.
[1396.78 --> 1402.14]  I've got my aunt, my sister, my wife, my son, and you in there.
[1402.22 --> 1404.18]  I think we're getting dangerously close to the limit.
[1404.24 --> 1404.60]  Oh, man.
[1404.60 --> 1406.14]  And you're the first one on the chopping block.
[1406.14 --> 1406.96]  Oh, I understand.
[1406.96 --> 1407.84]  I fully get it.
[1407.84 --> 1411.46]  So like if my daughter gets a phone or something and they haven't like increased the limit or
[1411.46 --> 1415.76]  something, then you might get, you might actually have to pay your $8 a month or whatever.
[1415.86 --> 1416.28]  That's horrible.
[1416.46 --> 1417.34]  I probably won't do it.
[1420.00 --> 1422.40]  I'll probably just manually put music on my phone again.
[1422.44 --> 1427.28]  Anyway, apparently this same problem with people sharing subscriptions is a problem for
[1427.28 --> 1431.76]  Spotify that they have decided to stop ignoring.
[1432.52 --> 1434.88]  I mean, I'm sure they've been aware of it for a long time.
[1434.88 --> 1437.02]  But basically, here's the summary.
[1437.14 --> 1438.86]  This was posted by someone on the forum.
[1439.58 --> 1444.52]  And they're saying as part of an effort to detect fraud and abuse of their premium family
[1444.52 --> 1450.00]  program, Spotify wants to know where you live or to obtain your location data.
[1450.00 --> 1456.16]  So the premium family program is a $15 a month plan for up to six people with the condition
[1456.16 --> 1460.88]  being, and this is in the T's and C's, even if it's something they haven't enforced, the
[1460.88 --> 1462.86]  condition being that they all live at the same address.
[1463.86 --> 1469.04]  In August, the company updated its terms and conditions for premium family subscribers requiring
[1469.04 --> 1474.74]  that they provide location data from time to time to ensure that they are actually all
[1474.74 --> 1475.92]  in the same family.
[1475.92 --> 1477.82]  That's not necessarily how family works.
[1478.42 --> 1478.76]  Yeah.
[1479.16 --> 1484.50]  Like my aunt doesn't live at my house, but she is certainly my family.
[1484.64 --> 1485.34]  So is my sister.
[1486.18 --> 1487.94]  None of my family live in my house.
[1488.14 --> 1488.42]  Yeah.
[1489.58 --> 1495.94]  So now with that said, the definition of family as someone who actually like has their
[1495.94 --> 1497.76]  own family, I run into this a fair bit.
[1497.90 --> 1498.12]  Wow.
[1498.28 --> 1498.60]  The definition.
[1498.72 --> 1499.18]  Well, no, no.
[1499.22 --> 1500.70]  I mean, you don't have kids.
[1500.98 --> 1502.20]  I know what you mean.
[1502.62 --> 1503.94]  You're not even mad about that.
[1503.94 --> 1505.38]  No, I'm not.
[1505.66 --> 1510.20]  So the definition of family, if you actually start digging into the T's and C's, varies
[1510.20 --> 1512.16]  a significant amount.
[1512.42 --> 1517.16]  Like the way that Google defines family versus the way Spotify defines family versus the way
[1517.16 --> 1520.02]  that science world defines family.
[1520.06 --> 1520.44]  Right.
[1520.44 --> 1520.52]  Yeah.
[1520.52 --> 1529.10]  Everyone has a different threshold for how immediate family needs to be and what the maximum number
[1529.10 --> 1530.94]  of family members you're allowed to have is.
[1531.32 --> 1538.30]  My family, my, like my, where with my parents, that family, not with my kids, that family.
[1538.44 --> 1538.62]  Okay.
[1538.62 --> 1540.42]  So my parents had five kids.
[1540.74 --> 1541.50]  So we were seven.
[1541.62 --> 1543.88]  We were a fully loaded minivan when we went places.
[1544.12 --> 1555.08]  And there were a lot of places where my mom, bless her heart, would get pushy about how many
[1555.08 --> 1557.70]  people should be allowed in when you are a family.
[1558.46 --> 1561.06]  Because most places cap it at either four or five.
[1561.44 --> 1563.06]  The world is designed for four.
[1563.48 --> 1564.80]  Two parents, two kids.
[1564.80 --> 1568.12]  As soon as you have five, you don't fit at the table at the food court.
[1568.74 --> 1569.28]  Think about it.
[1569.36 --> 1569.52]  Right?
[1569.74 --> 1569.86]  Yeah.
[1569.92 --> 1570.10]  Right?
[1570.44 --> 1570.58]  Yeah.
[1571.02 --> 1572.42]  You need two tables for everything.
[1572.54 --> 1574.00]  Or you need two passes or whatever else.
[1574.22 --> 1577.40]  You know, cars, you don't actually fit comfortably anymore.
[1577.66 --> 1577.88]  No.
[1578.12 --> 1580.00]  So there's a lot of things that are like that.
[1580.00 --> 1580.20]  Someone's got that middle seat in the back.
[1580.62 --> 1587.84]  So it doesn't surprise me that they would have this kind of, you know, stipulation, family
[1587.84 --> 1588.52]  with an asterisk.
[1588.58 --> 1589.68]  Now you looked up family.
[1589.86 --> 1589.98]  Okay.
[1589.98 --> 1590.46]  What's the definition?
[1590.46 --> 1591.94]  This is actually very interesting.
[1591.94 --> 1594.54]  There are two noun definitions for family.
[1594.54 --> 1594.84]  Really?
[1594.98 --> 1596.92]  And they contradict each other really heavily.
[1597.58 --> 1598.96]  Uh, specifically in this scenario.
[1599.20 --> 1604.66]  The first one is a group consisting of parents and children living together in a household.
[1605.80 --> 1609.82]  Number two is all the descendants of a common ancestor.
[1610.66 --> 1615.08]  They are actual opposites and they completely counter.
[1615.74 --> 1618.42]  So like Spotify is going with definition one.
[1618.68 --> 1619.02]  Yes.
[1619.08 --> 1620.70]  And I went with definition two.
[1621.12 --> 1621.68]  Right.
[1621.68 --> 1623.90]  They are both definitions of the word family.
[1623.90 --> 1624.74]  Okay.
[1624.74 --> 1625.00]  Okay then.
[1625.06 --> 1628.38]  So I wanted to like call them out and be like, that's not the definition of family.
[1628.54 --> 1630.70]  And then I was wrong and right.
[1630.96 --> 1632.54]  You're thinking more like family tree.
[1632.78 --> 1633.08]  Yes.
[1633.62 --> 1633.96]  All right.
[1634.04 --> 1638.00]  So when you sign up for the family plan, Spotify will ask those on the plan to provide
[1638.00 --> 1640.38]  the company a home address using Google Maps.
[1640.38 --> 1645.68]  Every person added to the plan will have to do the same or enable location services for Spotify
[1645.68 --> 1647.04]  on their devices to come.
[1647.40 --> 1652.02]  Spotify said it doesn't use that home location for advertising and that it doesn't store the
[1652.02 --> 1653.08]  data for internal use.
[1653.08 --> 1655.46]  So wait, you could just say I live here and then you're done?
[1655.84 --> 1656.84]  Because it says or.
[1656.84 --> 1657.84]  Hmm.
[1660.20 --> 1664.20]  Once verification of a family member's home address is completed, we do not store their
[1664.20 --> 1666.50]  location data or track their location at any time.
[1666.50 --> 1671.34]  But it also said that they want to require people to provide location data from time to
[1671.34 --> 1671.66]  time.
[1672.28 --> 1674.68]  The policy overlooks families that aren't living together.
[1674.82 --> 1676.30]  Like we discussed this.
[1676.30 --> 1684.64]  So like, I mean, obviously, adult children and their adult parents, I could see companies
[1684.64 --> 1685.70]  being like, you know what?
[1686.12 --> 1688.02]  You're all you're all working ass.
[1688.04 --> 1690.36]  But what if you're a boarding school kid?
[1690.52 --> 1691.14]  Yeah, exactly.
[1691.26 --> 1695.48]  But if you're someone who's away at college who legitimately is still a dependent, even
[1695.48 --> 1698.78]  if you don't live at the same address, that's that's pretty lame.
[1698.98 --> 1700.78]  But not even not even college.
[1701.18 --> 1703.08]  So what if you're like boarding middle school?
[1703.12 --> 1703.40]  Here we go.
[1703.40 --> 1707.38]  So they could ask for location data to check for fraud from time to time, but didn't specify
[1707.38 --> 1709.56]  when or how frequently those checks would happen.
[1710.40 --> 1715.54]  This also poses the problem of Spotify inadvertently tracking children and minors who aren't legally
[1715.54 --> 1717.24]  able to consent or object.
[1717.34 --> 1720.74]  You have to be 13 to use or sign up for Spotify.
[1722.20 --> 1722.90]  Oh, that's interesting.
[1723.06 --> 1724.62]  So my kids are allowed to use Google Play Music.
[1724.72 --> 1727.90]  I guess it doesn't matter because they don't need to collect location data.
[1728.26 --> 1728.50]  Yeah.
[1728.82 --> 1729.22]  Fascinating.
[1729.80 --> 1732.64]  Speaking of fascinating, our sponsor Ridge Wallet.
[1732.64 --> 1733.44]  Yeah.
[1733.80 --> 1738.24]  With Ridge Wallet, you can stop carrying pointless items around like receipts, old hotel room
[1738.24 --> 1739.54]  keys or spent gift cards.
[1740.00 --> 1743.04]  The Ridge Wallet is designed to help you carry less.
[1743.48 --> 1746.92]  It uses two metal plates that are bound by a strong elastic that keeps your cards tightly
[1746.92 --> 1748.06]  together but still accessible.
[1748.06 --> 1751.66]  And Ridge Wallet's RFID blocking.
[1751.66 --> 1757.40]  So you can't have your cards read by a skimmer who's hanging around next to you.
[1757.46 --> 1759.84]  They're available in aluminum, carbon fiber.
[1760.12 --> 1760.90]  This one's pretty sick.
[1761.26 --> 1761.90]  And titanium.
[1762.18 --> 1768.62]  And you can use offer code LTT September to save 10% at RidgeWallet.com slash LTT.
[1768.62 --> 1772.48]  Also sponsoring the show today, private internet access.
[1773.06 --> 1776.74]  PIA is the VPN that you should just use.
[1776.88 --> 1777.70]  It's kind of awesome.
[1777.96 --> 1778.08]  Yeah.
[1778.08 --> 1781.04]  I don't know if I've ever confessed this.
[1781.58 --> 1786.24]  I was a paying PIA customer while we were still partnered with TunnelBear.
[1787.10 --> 1787.38]  Okay.
[1787.50 --> 1788.38]  So was I.
[1789.14 --> 1790.12]  I don't know if you knew that or not.
[1790.18 --> 1790.60]  I didn't.
[1790.72 --> 1791.90]  Because we used it for float lane.
[1792.18 --> 1792.46]  Yeah.
[1793.00 --> 1794.10]  I just used it personally.
[1794.28 --> 1797.24]  But I was still okay with, yeah.
[1797.62 --> 1797.82]  I don't know.
[1797.82 --> 1798.80]  TunnelBear was fine.
[1799.36 --> 1800.78]  What TunnelBear was was different.
[1801.16 --> 1802.12]  It was...
[1802.12 --> 1802.58]  Simple.
[1802.92 --> 1803.26]  Yes.
[1803.42 --> 1804.66]  It was so simple that...
[1804.66 --> 1805.36]  And that was honestly...
[1805.36 --> 1807.14]  It was like brain dead simple.
[1807.16 --> 1808.94]  Like I could give it to my mom to use.
[1809.04 --> 1809.38]  Yes.
[1809.62 --> 1810.82]  Whereas PIA...
[1812.46 --> 1812.86]  I mean...
[1812.86 --> 1813.86]  It's slightly more advanced.
[1814.02 --> 1817.02]  It's easy enough to use, but it's also a more advanced product.
[1817.14 --> 1819.74]  There's a lot of customizability that you can do if you want.
[1819.82 --> 1823.40]  If you took like two minutes of your own time, you could set it up for them.
[1823.54 --> 1823.88]  Yes.
[1824.04 --> 1826.46]  But it's also kind of pretty easy.
[1826.62 --> 1826.98]  Yes.
[1827.34 --> 1827.54]  Yeah.
[1827.82 --> 1832.28]  So private internet access supports a variety of VPN protocols and types of encryption.
[1832.28 --> 1835.92]  It's available for Windows, Mac OS, Android, iOS, Linux, and Google Chrome.
[1836.14 --> 1838.38]  You can connect up to five devices at the same time.
[1838.44 --> 1841.82]  Not that we're endorsing the sharing accounts paradigm.
[1843.08 --> 1845.52]  My in-laws are on my PIA account.
[1845.60 --> 1845.82]  Oh.
[1846.98 --> 1848.04]  Well, they were traveling.
[1849.34 --> 1852.96]  Their apps include DNS leak protection and IPv6 leak protection.
[1853.14 --> 1857.40]  And they've got an internet kill switch that will block all traffic if the VPN becomes
[1857.40 --> 1858.06]  disconnected unexpectedly.
[1858.06 --> 1858.50]  Super important.
[1858.92 --> 1861.80]  Check it out today at lmg.gg slash PIA WAN.
[1861.80 --> 1862.24]  Yeah.
[1862.42 --> 1864.68]  Torrinters are definitely into that kill switch.
[1865.38 --> 1865.66]  Because-
[1865.66 --> 1866.58]  The kill switch is very important.
[1867.00 --> 1868.62]  Just in general, the kill switch is important.
[1868.62 --> 1869.00]  In general.
[1869.08 --> 1871.54]  But I could see torrinters being pretty into that feature.
[1871.66 --> 1871.94]  Sure.
[1872.22 --> 1873.66]  But it's important for everybody.
[1873.78 --> 1876.64]  The show is also brought to you by Savage Jerky.
[1876.86 --> 1877.18]  Savage.
[1878.24 --> 1878.54]  Oh.
[1879.30 --> 1880.16]  Oh, you want the mojo?
[1880.24 --> 1880.64]  Oh, yeah.
[1880.78 --> 1881.10]  All right.
[1881.10 --> 1884.20]  Mojo was my first love.
[1884.68 --> 1884.96]  I'm going to do-
[1884.96 --> 1886.32]  Oh, that's my actual favorite.
[1886.52 --> 1887.46]  Have you not tried that?
[1887.58 --> 1888.22]  I have tried it.
[1888.24 --> 1889.64]  I'm going to do the mojo jalapeno today.
[1889.78 --> 1890.08]  It's very good.
[1890.08 --> 1892.30]  People have been getting mad at me about eating on the show.
[1892.48 --> 1896.60]  So if I open up this pack of maple buffalo bacon, I will end up eating for the rest of
[1896.60 --> 1896.90]  the show.
[1896.90 --> 1899.84]  So I am- I'm trying to be nice.
[1899.84 --> 1903.96]  There was comments on the last WAN show about how you started off with people being like,
[1904.02 --> 1905.24]  oh, people don't like what I eat on the show.
[1905.32 --> 1908.78]  And the show was shoving an entire fistful of bacon into your face.
[1909.10 --> 1909.52]  Mm-hmm.
[1911.22 --> 1913.32]  You know, it felt like a waste.
[1914.34 --> 1916.14]  Because I really like the maple buffalo bacon.
[1916.96 --> 1922.58]  But like, just cramming it in your food hole, you're not appreciating it properly.
[1923.48 --> 1923.62]  Yeah.
[1923.62 --> 1927.16]  I like to- I actually like to go slow with it, which is why I end up eating it for the
[1927.16 --> 1927.88]  entire rest of the show.
[1927.94 --> 1929.00]  It's not actually a ton of bacon.
[1929.18 --> 1930.38]  Like, savage jerky's not cheap.
[1930.98 --> 1932.04]  But it is delicious.
[1933.84 --> 1934.26]  What the heck?
[1934.30 --> 1935.18]  My talking points are gone.
[1935.26 --> 1935.44]  Whatever.
[1935.52 --> 1935.92]  It doesn't matter.
[1936.88 --> 1938.60]  They've got a bunch of different flavors of jerky.
[1939.86 --> 1946.44]  All different levels of heat from very tolerable all the way to like, wow, you're punishing
[1946.44 --> 1946.96]  yourself.
[1949.52 --> 1950.44]  Go for it.
[1950.48 --> 1950.94]  You go, Ham.
[1950.98 --> 1951.62]  You do your thing.
[1951.70 --> 1952.56]  That's basically your range.
[1952.56 --> 1954.78]  Like, mojo is really mild.
[1955.06 --> 1956.06]  I like spice.
[1956.14 --> 1957.04]  But mojo is really good.
[1957.82 --> 1960.30]  Because I like the garlic, lime, cilantro, all that kind of stuff.
[1960.36 --> 1961.32]  It just tastes great.
[1961.40 --> 1963.78]  They're made with high quality ingredients without nitrates.
[1963.94 --> 1967.52]  And they also have other products like their spice rub and their hot sauces.
[1967.64 --> 1969.58]  Their hot sauces are freaking delicious.
[1970.08 --> 1975.90]  You can use offer code LTT to save 10% on all their products at lmg.gg slash savage jerky.
[1975.90 --> 1977.14]  That yellow one.
[1977.44 --> 1978.52]  It's pineapple something.
[1978.52 --> 1979.52]  The sauce.
[1979.52 --> 1980.82]  I think it's barbecue sauce.
[1981.16 --> 1982.92]  Carolina habanero pineapple.
[1983.08 --> 1983.22]  Yeah.
[1983.28 --> 1983.80]  Barbecue sauce.
[1984.16 --> 1984.94]  Brought that camping.
[1985.16 --> 1986.14]  Was very good.
[1987.08 --> 1988.22]  It was absolutely fantastic.
[1988.22 --> 1990.84]  Oh, shoot.
[1990.84 --> 1991.84]  Sorry.
[1991.84 --> 1992.40]  Oh, boy.
[1993.40 --> 1994.28]  Wrong keyboard.
[1994.28 --> 1994.38]  Wrong keyboard.
[1995.68 --> 1997.74]  You might have to YubiKey that as well.
[1998.30 --> 1998.68]  Yeah.
[1998.82 --> 1999.52]  That's pretty annoying.
[2000.14 --> 2001.28]  Do you want to do the next topic?
[2001.82 --> 2002.04]  Yeah.
[2002.08 --> 2003.18]  I'm trying to pick one real quick.
[2004.36 --> 2005.54]  Do you want to talk about the virtual boy?
[2005.94 --> 2006.42]  Sure.
[2006.62 --> 2007.42]  Or your OLED.
[2008.12 --> 2008.52]  Oh.
[2009.54 --> 2009.98]  Okay.
[2010.04 --> 2012.16]  I don't have enough concentration while I'm logging in.
[2012.18 --> 2012.36]  Okay.
[2012.36 --> 2013.18]  So, virtual boy.
[2013.86 --> 2018.12]  We've been waiting to film this video for, I think, at least two years.
[2019.18 --> 2019.84]  At least two years?
[2019.92 --> 2020.12]  No.
[2020.36 --> 2021.28]  Over a year, for sure.
[2021.28 --> 2021.78]  Over a year.
[2022.16 --> 2023.08]  At least over a year.
[2023.30 --> 2023.46]  Yeah.
[2023.90 --> 2025.26]  This is not mine, actually.
[2025.26 --> 2031.06]  This is the one that Linus Media Group acquired from someone who's quite amazing and did a bunch
[2031.06 --> 2033.88]  of modifications to it that are, like, really clean.
[2033.88 --> 2037.56]  That's one thing I want to point out, too, is it was done very well.
[2037.60 --> 2039.08]  That is a heavily modded virtual boy.
[2039.12 --> 2044.00]  We actually borrowed it from, I think they have a YouTube channel?
[2045.18 --> 2046.82]  I'm just going to double check.
[2046.98 --> 2050.60]  I can basically guarantee you, though, if you handed this to someone who didn't know it
[2050.60 --> 2051.96]  was modded, they wouldn't think it was modded.
[2052.22 --> 2052.44]  Yeah.
[2052.60 --> 2053.42]  Retro RGB.
[2054.16 --> 2054.44]  Yeah.
[2055.42 --> 2056.36]  Freaking awesome.
[2056.94 --> 2060.32]  Actually, I wonder if he did a video about it.
[2060.90 --> 2061.64]  Retro RGB.
[2063.00 --> 2063.26]  Yeah.
[2063.26 --> 2065.84]  He just got streamed Hyper Fighting live.
[2066.70 --> 2067.66]  So, here.
[2068.52 --> 2070.92]  So, Luke actually already owned a virtual boy.
[2071.24 --> 2071.42]  Yeah.
[2071.42 --> 2076.12]  And he kind of brought it to work and was like, hey, do we want to do a video about this
[2076.12 --> 2076.36]  thing?
[2076.76 --> 2078.86]  It's, like, kind of a...
[2078.86 --> 2082.70]  It's kind of a curiosity at this point, because they didn't sell a ton of them.
[2083.20 --> 2088.62]  It was sort of unanimously agreed on that it was bad.
[2088.62 --> 2089.18]  Yeah.
[2089.26 --> 2097.66]  But it was also, like so many of the things Nintendo does, so different and so far ahead
[2097.66 --> 2106.20]  of its time that it's sort of worth looking back at just to see, here we are now.
[2106.28 --> 2107.16]  Where did we come from?
[2107.22 --> 2109.06]  And, like, getting a better understanding of that.
[2109.06 --> 2115.00]  Like, it's almost successful in a way that it is now 2019, and you and I are looking at
[2115.00 --> 2120.18]  this thing, fascinated, and we had a solid amount of fun, and I still have a headache.
[2120.18 --> 2122.18]  Like, but, like...
[2123.18 --> 2124.68]  But it's just...
[2124.68 --> 2127.28]  It's a very, very interesting device.
[2127.50 --> 2130.00]  So, what's really cool about the video we just did is...
[2130.00 --> 2130.36]  Oh, sorry.
[2130.42 --> 2130.96]  I'm eating again.
[2131.08 --> 2131.92]  This one is really good.
[2132.12 --> 2132.28]  Yeah.
[2132.80 --> 2133.02]  Yeah.
[2133.12 --> 2133.36]  Okay.
[2134.26 --> 2134.68]  All right.
[2134.72 --> 2135.00]  I'm done.
[2136.60 --> 2140.26]  So, what's really cool about this thing is that...
[2140.26 --> 2140.90]  Oh, sorry.
[2140.98 --> 2141.72]  I bit into a seed.
[2142.04 --> 2142.60]  That's really hot.
[2145.76 --> 2148.22]  I'm not sure what direction he's going in, so I can't step in.
[2148.32 --> 2148.98]  Yeah, it's fine.
[2148.98 --> 2150.28]  There's a bunch of really interesting stuff.
[2150.28 --> 2151.10]  There's a bunch of really cool stuff.
[2151.20 --> 2155.80]  So, what was really cool about our video is that the Virtual Boy was launched and then
[2155.80 --> 2158.08]  discontinued, I think, just over a year later.
[2158.68 --> 2163.88]  So, a bunch of the stuff that they promised, including, apparently, a strap that would, like,
[2163.96 --> 2168.28]  keep it against your face so you didn't have to rest it on a table and, like, lean into
[2168.28 --> 2175.40]  it like this, and that also included multiplayer support, just never materialized.
[2175.40 --> 2182.96]  But, thanks to Homebrew Retro Gamers, you guys are amazing.
[2182.96 --> 2183.96]  Yeah.
[2183.96 --> 2189.24]  So, the game that actually shipped with the console, Mario's Tennis, not to be confused
[2189.24 --> 2192.98]  with Mario Tennis, which was an N64 game, if I recall correctly.
[2192.98 --> 2193.20]  Yeah.
[2193.20 --> 2194.18]  That was the first one, right?
[2194.18 --> 2194.40]  Yeah.
[2194.40 --> 2194.58]  Yeah.
[2194.58 --> 2195.26]  Well, yeah.
[2195.26 --> 2197.26]  Mario's Tennis.
[2197.26 --> 2201.38]  I forget how I started this sentence.
[2201.48 --> 2201.60]  Whatever.
[2201.74 --> 2204.04]  Mario's Tennis was actually modded by the community.
[2204.78 --> 2207.64]  Actually, a particular member, I think, did the vast majority of the work on it.
[2207.94 --> 2217.40]  And what they did was they actually took latent code that existed on the cartridge and activated
[2217.40 --> 2224.10]  it, then flashed that to, you can get these, what's the Virtual Boy, like, flash cartridge
[2224.10 --> 2224.30]  called?
[2224.30 --> 2224.72]  Flash Boy.
[2225.38 --> 2225.66]  Okay.
[2225.78 --> 2229.46]  So, there's this Flash Boy 2 thing that you can use to program Homebrew games.
[2229.52 --> 2229.96]  Flash Boy Plus.
[2229.96 --> 2230.96]  Flash Boy Plus.
[2231.22 --> 2232.54]  Or modified games.
[2233.56 --> 2236.88]  Put it in, and boom, multiplayer works.
[2237.18 --> 2243.34]  So, in the video, Luke and I get to have what is not just, like, a decades-old gaming experience,
[2243.44 --> 2246.10]  but a decades-old gaming experience that actually didn't exist at the time.
[2246.10 --> 2251.40]  We get to play multiplayer Mario's Tennis, and it's pretty freaking awesome.
[2251.74 --> 2251.86]  Yeah.
[2252.30 --> 2253.30]  I had a lot of fun.
[2253.62 --> 2254.24]  I did, too.
[2254.60 --> 2255.82]  It was legitimately very fun.
[2255.92 --> 2256.78]  I legitimately had a lot of fun.
[2256.88 --> 2257.02]  Yeah.
[2259.22 --> 2260.58]  But, like, also...
[2260.58 --> 2261.22]  I have a headache.
[2261.54 --> 2262.56]  I also have a headache.
[2262.70 --> 2267.32]  I think we did play it a little bit too long, because we turned the game off and back
[2267.32 --> 2270.56]  on, so we didn't get the, like, warning that you should stop playing.
[2271.80 --> 2275.26]  15 minutes should not be too long for a game.
[2276.10 --> 2278.64]  The experience has some issues.
[2278.90 --> 2285.04]  I also think if we turned the game on and, like, looked away for a while and then went
[2285.04 --> 2285.92]  into it, it might have been better.
[2286.30 --> 2287.56]  Because when it's, like, first starting...
[2287.56 --> 2289.96]  I'm not going to get necessarily into why, because you should watch the video.
[2290.28 --> 2292.24]  But when it's first starting, it's a little bit more jarring.
[2292.24 --> 2295.14]  I think we can tell them why.
[2295.24 --> 2297.42]  It's because there's these mirrors vibrating back and forth.
[2297.44 --> 2297.52]  Yeah.
[2297.60 --> 2298.46]  You can hear them.
[2299.08 --> 2303.44]  And it takes a little while for the image to kind of, like, get right.
[2303.54 --> 2304.22]  So it's kind of jarring.
[2304.32 --> 2304.70]  It's like...
[2304.70 --> 2304.78]  Yeah.
[2304.78 --> 2309.28]  It's kind of like when your VR headset loses tracking for a little bit.
[2309.36 --> 2309.62]  Yeah.
[2309.80 --> 2311.32]  And you're, like, looking over here and it's, like, up there.
[2311.40 --> 2312.24]  And it's like...
[2312.24 --> 2314.24]  Like, okay.
[2314.56 --> 2315.36]  I was fine.
[2315.40 --> 2315.94]  Now I'm sick.
[2315.98 --> 2316.76]  Thank you for that.
[2317.04 --> 2320.68]  And it's all black and red images, which is just kind of intense.
[2320.86 --> 2322.20]  It's pretty bad.
[2322.42 --> 2322.52]  Like...
[2322.52 --> 2322.66]  Yeah.
[2323.32 --> 2326.66]  With that said, I was impressed by the stereo 3D effect.
[2327.50 --> 2329.20]  I mean, I was eventually, too.
[2329.24 --> 2330.46]  Honestly, I prefer...
[2332.18 --> 2335.48]  I prefer it to a 3DS.
[2336.42 --> 2336.72]  Yeah.
[2336.76 --> 2337.38]  I think it works better.
[2337.38 --> 2338.86]  The 3DS gave me nausea.
[2339.06 --> 2339.18]  Like...
[2339.18 --> 2340.52]  I never enjoyed the 3DS.
[2340.52 --> 2341.16]  Almost immediately.
[2341.42 --> 2343.42]  What could they possibly have been thinking?
[2343.52 --> 2345.24]  Like, I never had a 3DS.
[2345.90 --> 2347.40]  So I had a DS.
[2347.82 --> 2350.68]  Played a ton of Mario Kart on that thing until I broke my trigger fingers, because that's
[2350.68 --> 2352.46]  what happens when you play a ton of Mario Kart on a DS.
[2352.46 --> 2357.72]  And then I just, like, never, like, fixed it or I never got a new one.
[2358.42 --> 2359.38]  Anyway, so I had a DS.
[2359.78 --> 2363.98]  And then I didn't do the 3DS thing, because I just, like, I had a kid or something.
[2364.06 --> 2365.70]  I forget what the exact timing is, but it just...
[2365.70 --> 2366.20]  I was busy.
[2367.30 --> 2369.20]  And then the first time, I actually...
[2369.98 --> 2370.66]  Aside from...
[2370.66 --> 2374.34]  I think I walked past, like, a display unit in, like, Future Shop or something, and I
[2374.34 --> 2375.48]  was like, oh, okay, that's kind of weird.
[2375.92 --> 2376.76]  And, like, I looked at it.
[2376.88 --> 2377.64]  But that was it.
[2377.78 --> 2380.90]  The first time I really, like, tried to play a game with it was a couple weeks ago.
[2380.90 --> 2381.46]  Oh.
[2381.82 --> 2385.22]  Brandon lent me his 3DS to play Fire Emblem Awakening.
[2385.82 --> 2387.76]  Because there's a new one out that's apparently really good.
[2388.08 --> 2391.82]  And I was like, oh, believe it or not, I've, like, you know, casually talking, I've never
[2391.82 --> 2392.64]  played a Fire Emblem game.
[2392.66 --> 2393.26]  And he's like, what?
[2394.58 --> 2395.68]  It's like his whole thing.
[2395.68 --> 2396.26]  Brandon's super into Fire Emblem.
[2396.56 --> 2396.78]  Anyway.
[2397.00 --> 2397.66]  I think I...
[2397.66 --> 2398.40]  So I turned it on.
[2399.02 --> 2402.24]  And, like, you moved...
[2402.24 --> 2407.10]  How could you possibly think that a stereo effect that relies on the eyes being in a fixed
[2407.10 --> 2409.34]  position is a good idea on a handheld device?
[2409.34 --> 2410.82]  Because...
[2410.82 --> 2411.30]  I mean...
[2411.30 --> 2414.16]  It kind of helps that you have to, like, shove your face into the Virtual Boy.
[2414.30 --> 2414.50]  Yeah.
[2414.64 --> 2416.20]  Because it positions you correctly.
[2417.06 --> 2419.98]  It's awkward when you have to, like, play a game like this.
[2420.36 --> 2422.22]  But it does position you correctly.
[2423.34 --> 2424.16]  And eat really quietly.
[2424.24 --> 2424.84]  This is really good.
[2425.84 --> 2426.92]  You can go over here.
[2427.42 --> 2429.86]  But yeah, it was really fun, actually.
[2429.86 --> 2431.88]  It's...
[2431.88 --> 2432.72]  I think...
[2432.72 --> 2438.22]  I genuinely think a big part of the fun is playing some weird derpy game on a weird derpy
[2438.22 --> 2439.08]  device.
[2439.64 --> 2440.02]  Multiplayer.
[2440.20 --> 2440.98]  Weird derpy controllers.
[2441.16 --> 2442.14]  With weird derpy controllers.
[2442.58 --> 2443.02]  Multiplayer.
[2443.28 --> 2443.46]  Yeah.
[2443.52 --> 2445.08]  They have D-pads on each side.
[2445.32 --> 2445.52]  Yeah.
[2445.52 --> 2446.68]  There's a D-pad here and here.
[2446.72 --> 2447.92]  I realize you can't see that that well.
[2448.02 --> 2449.20]  But there's D-pads on both sides.
[2449.40 --> 2450.28]  Which is odd.
[2450.36 --> 2454.78]  And then the start and select are the exact same format as the A and B.
[2454.86 --> 2455.00]  Yeah.
[2455.00 --> 2458.52]  And you can't see the controller because you're in the thing.
[2459.02 --> 2460.44]  And then there's triggers on the back.
[2460.54 --> 2461.36]  But they're not labeled.
[2461.46 --> 2461.92]  Oh, they are.
[2462.00 --> 2462.86]  Just left and right.
[2462.92 --> 2465.36]  And they didn't do anything in any of the games we played, did they?
[2465.54 --> 2468.00]  They did in the...
[2468.56 --> 2469.36]  Oh, Hyper Fighter.
[2469.42 --> 2469.90]  Hyper Fighter.
[2469.98 --> 2470.30]  Oh, okay.
[2470.72 --> 2470.88]  Yeah.
[2471.08 --> 2471.26]  Yeah.
[2471.58 --> 2474.40]  So are you actually going to fix your Virtual Boy?
[2474.64 --> 2474.84]  Yeah.
[2475.96 --> 2476.48]  Are you?
[2476.82 --> 2477.60]  Yeah, probably.
[2478.32 --> 2479.58]  Is it going to be like the shelves?
[2479.78 --> 2480.96]  Is it going to take 18 months?
[2481.24 --> 2481.68]  It might.
[2482.24 --> 2483.08]  I've got other...
[2483.08 --> 2484.60]  I've been doing one major project.
[2485.00 --> 2487.94]  For my house thing, apartment, whatever, every weekend.
[2488.00 --> 2489.34]  Well, now you're doing a koi pond.
[2489.40 --> 2489.86]  Is that right?
[2490.00 --> 2490.18]  Yeah.
[2490.30 --> 2490.92]  Why koi pond?
[2492.44 --> 2497.08]  So my girlfriend went a little plant crazy out of nowhere.
[2497.32 --> 2500.60]  And we now own 40 plants.
[2501.46 --> 2501.90]  What?
[2502.10 --> 2503.30]  Most of them are really small.
[2503.84 --> 2506.94]  I have a hard time imagining you owning a single plant.
[2507.22 --> 2508.82]  I don't.
[2509.22 --> 2509.50]  Right?
[2509.60 --> 2510.58]  They're like hers.
[2510.58 --> 2518.86]  And I have technically owned exactly one singular plant since around 2013 and is still alive.
[2520.36 --> 2523.48]  I thought I lost it when I moved, but it's in my parents' garage and I haven't bothered
[2523.48 --> 2524.08]  to pick it up yet.
[2524.12 --> 2525.64]  But I guarantee you it is still alive.
[2526.00 --> 2526.78]  In your parents' garage.
[2526.78 --> 2528.58]  With all the light in your parents' garage.
[2528.66 --> 2532.08]  I have forgotten that thing behind stuff.
[2532.58 --> 2533.28]  Nick knows.
[2533.48 --> 2536.40]  I have forgotten that thing behind stuff for like a year at a time and it's still alive.
[2536.50 --> 2537.52]  No, Nick agrees with me.
[2537.62 --> 2537.92]  It's an...
[2537.92 --> 2539.04]  Remember the aloe vera plant?
[2539.68 --> 2540.66]  Oh, it's an aloe vera plant.
[2540.72 --> 2541.14]  That bar...
[2541.14 --> 2542.68]  It is still a plant.
[2542.70 --> 2543.88]  That barely counts.
[2543.88 --> 2544.84]  It still counts.
[2545.30 --> 2546.66]  Anyways, I'm not in charge of these.
[2546.66 --> 2547.66]  It's literally a cactus.
[2547.66 --> 2550.64]  It's a plant.
[2551.10 --> 2551.66]  It's a plant.
[2552.02 --> 2552.52]  It's green.
[2553.48 --> 2554.36]  Yeah, it's in...
[2554.36 --> 2555.00]  It's in soil.
[2555.36 --> 2556.18]  Kingdom whatever.
[2557.58 --> 2559.66]  Kingdom planta or whatever the...
[2560.24 --> 2561.04]  Yeah, yeah.
[2561.04 --> 2563.86]  As long as it's not an aloe vera mixed with alcohol plant.
[2564.00 --> 2564.52]  Yeah, oh.
[2564.52 --> 2565.58]  It'll give you flashbacks.
[2565.58 --> 2566.78]  Oh, that...
[2566.78 --> 2567.00]  Yeah.
[2567.56 --> 2568.36]  That was...
[2568.36 --> 2569.72]  Yeah, that was a terrible time.
[2569.90 --> 2570.66]  But, um...
[2571.38 --> 2573.70]  Yeah, so we have a bajillion plants now.
[2574.32 --> 2576.32]  And then, uh...
[2576.32 --> 2577.86]  She wanted to do something with the deck.
[2578.26 --> 2579.88]  She knows you can get fake ones, right?
[2579.92 --> 2580.98]  That you don't have to water?
[2581.20 --> 2583.06]  Apparently she's, like, against that now.
[2583.54 --> 2586.04]  And she's, like, on some...
[2586.04 --> 2586.68]  I don't know.
[2586.82 --> 2588.44]  She's super into it.
[2588.56 --> 2588.72]  Whatever.
[2589.94 --> 2591.04]  She doesn't watch Wann's show.
[2591.10 --> 2592.02]  You can speak freely here.
[2592.20 --> 2592.70]  No, I am.
[2593.48 --> 2594.56]  Okay, for her...
[2594.56 --> 2596.38]  She's into something, and I think that's cool.
[2596.72 --> 2597.12]  Okay.
[2597.32 --> 2598.68]  And it makes the house look better.
[2599.76 --> 2603.24]  And, like, plants and water and stuff smells good.
[2603.24 --> 2604.62]  Yeah, it smells nice.
[2604.74 --> 2606.14]  So, like, the house looks and smells good.
[2606.22 --> 2606.48]  Okay.
[2606.78 --> 2607.78]  So, sweet.
[2608.02 --> 2609.36]  Was she sending you a message?
[2610.10 --> 2610.54]  I don't...
[2610.54 --> 2611.86]  I genuinely don't think so.
[2612.92 --> 2613.60]  But maybe.
[2613.60 --> 2614.62]  Do you want me finding out what that beeping is?
[2615.32 --> 2616.14]  Sounds like a UPS.
[2618.10 --> 2620.28]  It's probably annoying to the Wann show, peeps.
[2620.40 --> 2621.46]  That's Nick, by the way.
[2621.64 --> 2624.94]  Which means he's probably here, so that I will tell you guys...
[2624.94 --> 2625.48]  Talk about merch?
[2625.60 --> 2627.08]  ...about LTTstore.com.
[2627.26 --> 2627.84]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2629.18 --> 2630.44]  Basically, it's good stuff.
[2630.44 --> 2633.88]  The LTT Stealth hoodie is back in stock.
[2633.98 --> 2635.56]  We have all sizes in stock.
[2635.74 --> 2641.08]  I have personally confirmed that the phone pocket fits the Galaxy Note 10+.
[2641.08 --> 2641.58]  Oh.
[2641.76 --> 2642.88]  It's a little tight.
[2643.72 --> 2644.64]  It fits...
[2644.64 --> 2648.22]  But that's not bad, because that phone pocket's designed to, like, hold your phone in place.
[2648.22 --> 2651.32]  It fits a little tight, but dang it, it fits.
[2651.98 --> 2654.88]  We've also got the very popular Ram t-shirt.
[2655.00 --> 2659.12]  This one has been a smash hit, thanks to David's excellent modeling, of course.
[2659.94 --> 2660.84]  This is my favorite.
[2661.32 --> 2662.10]  Yeah, I saw that.
[2662.54 --> 2663.30]  It's like, wow.
[2663.94 --> 2664.28]  Okay.
[2664.52 --> 2668.36]  Hard Drive shirt is now one of our top sellers.
[2668.78 --> 2672.52]  Remember, if your friends aren't nerdy, they'll think you have a cool record player shirt.
[2672.52 --> 2676.62]  Or DJ shirt, if you're not 80 years old.
[2676.78 --> 2677.66]  Yeah, DJ shirt.
[2678.34 --> 2679.76]  Processor, also a good one.
[2679.76 --> 2680.88]  I love the processor one.
[2680.96 --> 2681.80]  Sorry for this.
[2681.98 --> 2682.34]  Sorry.
[2682.60 --> 2682.94]  Sorry.
[2683.26 --> 2684.44]  Also, here's Dennis naked.
[2685.06 --> 2685.50]  Sorry.
[2685.82 --> 2686.14]  Sorry.
[2686.42 --> 2687.24]  They're amazing, though.
[2687.30 --> 2688.78]  If you're really sorry, you should check out our Twitter right now.
[2688.82 --> 2689.68]  They're super comfortable.
[2689.88 --> 2691.06]  No, I'm not that sorry.
[2691.24 --> 2691.98]  I saw that.
[2692.08 --> 2694.40]  There's a really disturbing picture on our Twitter right now.
[2694.94 --> 2696.04]  The water bottle's awesome.
[2696.04 --> 2697.08]  Oh, there's a new picture.
[2697.92 --> 2699.06]  I saw that one, too.
[2699.14 --> 2699.38]  Okay.
[2699.64 --> 2700.36]  The Dennis one.
[2700.48 --> 2700.66]  No.
[2701.30 --> 2701.60]  What?
[2701.76 --> 2702.58]  There's another picture?
[2702.58 --> 2703.84]  There's a new picture of you in your underwear, dude.
[2704.76 --> 2705.10]  What?
[2706.48 --> 2711.10]  Okay, I'm not going to subject you guys to this if it's really awful, but I do have to go on
[2711.10 --> 2713.26]  our Twitter right now and find out what my team is tweeting.
[2713.26 --> 2713.76]  Can I just power that down?
[2714.12 --> 2716.04]  No, the best thing to do is plug it into the wall.
[2716.20 --> 2718.84]  Well, it's plugged in, but it's on Casa, I think.
[2719.56 --> 2721.66]  Okay, you just press the button on the Casa module.
[2721.98 --> 2722.16]  Yeah.
[2723.42 --> 2723.78]  Okay.
[2723.78 --> 2728.32]  Okay, so you guys, I don't want you to take this out of context, okay?
[2731.44 --> 2733.90]  Is that even a real, like, are you actually even holding that laptop?
[2734.00 --> 2734.28]  Oh, yeah.
[2734.70 --> 2736.08]  Okay, it's not, like, photoshopped in?
[2736.14 --> 2741.48]  Yeah, so I told Alex we need to do a picture.
[2741.48 --> 2745.96]  Like, one of the things we're trying to do is we're trying to have a little, a few more,
[2746.08 --> 2748.14]  like, we're trying to have more fun moments in the videos.
[2748.28 --> 2750.02]  Sorry, I won't make you keep looking at that.
[2750.10 --> 2750.30]  Okay.
[2750.60 --> 2753.48]  We're trying to have more fun moments in the videos, like, things that are kind of jiffy.
[2753.78 --> 2754.50]  You know?
[2754.50 --> 2762.74]  And so there's a line in the video about the new Alienware M15 where we talk about how it's sexy.
[2762.84 --> 2765.12]  And I was like, yeah, it's like a jiffable moment.
[2765.20 --> 2767.54]  We should just do, like, a sexy dance with the M15.
[2767.54 --> 2772.96]  And I had intended, I had intended to wear the underwear.
[2773.34 --> 2774.24]  That was my intent.
[2775.04 --> 2777.10]  The tie and the hat is his doing.
[2777.32 --> 2777.64]  Okay.
[2777.64 --> 2785.94]  So, if you guys don't want to experience that, I can't say that I recommend our Alienware M15 video.
[2787.14 --> 2791.24]  But, hey, you can never say that I wasn't honest with you before.
[2792.52 --> 2792.92]  Yeah.
[2793.42 --> 2793.66]  Yeah.
[2793.66 --> 2796.10]  So, I ditched my OLED.
[2796.46 --> 2796.92]  Yeah, why?
[2797.32 --> 2797.62]  Okay.
[2797.96 --> 2798.82]  I'll explain why.
[2798.84 --> 2799.88]  Because I don't, yeah.
[2800.42 --> 2812.50]  One of the main reasons that I have been such an advocate of OLED is that I can't stand the black glow.
[2812.50 --> 2818.04]  The glow, the gray glow, when the screen is supposed to be black.
[2818.20 --> 2818.36]  Yeah.
[2818.66 --> 2820.76]  It drives me nuts.
[2820.84 --> 2822.54]  I find it very immersion-breaking.
[2822.74 --> 2822.94]  Okay.
[2823.02 --> 2825.62]  Now, obviously, I can live with it.
[2825.62 --> 2838.94]  I haven't gone so, so 2019 soft that I am simply too triggered by a black screen on an LCD that I must leave, that I have to leave the, like, it's not like that.
[2838.94 --> 2845.34]  But, if I don't have to have that, I will certainly choose something that doesn't have it.
[2845.46 --> 2845.70]  Okay.
[2846.02 --> 2846.78]  Perfect blacks.
[2847.24 --> 2847.68]  Amazing.
[2848.12 --> 2848.36]  Yeah.
[2849.32 --> 2851.22]  So, one of the things that bugs me most.
[2851.22 --> 2853.56]  So, you're not, like, ditching your current OLED for a new OLED?
[2853.82 --> 2854.12]  No.
[2854.36 --> 2854.62]  Okay.
[2854.74 --> 2858.66]  I have ditched OLED in my living room for the first time in years now.
[2858.78 --> 2859.04]  Okay.
[2859.26 --> 2859.52]  Okay.
[2859.52 --> 2867.96]  So, one of the things that drives me most crazy is the black bars in letterboxed content.
[2867.96 --> 2869.08]  Okay.
[2869.08 --> 2869.86]  When they're gray.
[2870.20 --> 2870.42]  Yeah.
[2870.60 --> 2879.58]  So, that instead of just seeing the content and nothing else, you've got the content with a gray buffer with a black wall behind it.
[2879.58 --> 2885.94]  Because, presumably, you are not a monster and you have turned out the lights in your living room in order to properly enjoy a film.
[2887.94 --> 2890.48]  So, it drives me absolutely crazy.
[2890.48 --> 2898.08]  So, I took home Asus's PG-65U BFGD.
[2898.26 --> 2899.30]  Big Format Gaming Display.
[2899.54 --> 2902.38]  Which is, like, a year and a half late now.
[2902.54 --> 2903.36]  I don't know.
[2903.42 --> 2904.62]  I've been, like, waiting for this thing.
[2904.68 --> 2906.40]  It feels like forever.
[2906.40 --> 2909.32]  They seem to be pretty late with displays a lot.
[2910.16 --> 2910.48]  Yeah.
[2910.76 --> 2912.50]  Just putting that out there.
[2912.60 --> 2915.48]  It seems to be the ones they're partnered with NVIDIA on.
[2916.30 --> 2917.10]  That's fair.
[2918.96 --> 2920.20]  Because, other than that.
[2920.22 --> 2920.78]  That's accurate.
[2921.00 --> 2922.92]  They kind of launch things when they say they're going to.
[2922.92 --> 2923.40]  That's accurate.
[2923.40 --> 2933.10]  Anyway, so, I took it home and I have to say, they have done a great job of the full array local dimming.
[2933.62 --> 2936.56]  I can find scenarios where it is noticeable.
[2937.06 --> 2937.18]  Okay.
[2937.20 --> 2938.18]  I can create scenarios.
[2938.34 --> 2939.12]  Like that.
[2939.20 --> 2940.54]  I can create a scenario where it's noticeable.
[2940.64 --> 2946.32]  Move a mouse cursor around on anything dark and you can see the halo following around the cursor.
[2947.26 --> 2949.60]  But, I have to give them credit.
[2949.60 --> 2955.94]  One of the things that I didn't do properly when we evaluated the HP Omen X Imperium or whatever it was called.
[2956.68 --> 2959.52]  Was view it from a more realistic angle.
[2959.74 --> 2963.22]  I was always looking at it flat like a monitor or even, like, standing above it.
[2963.24 --> 2965.04]  Because it was just, like, sitting on a desk in the office.
[2965.20 --> 2965.36]  Okay.
[2965.66 --> 2968.92]  And they actually tuned it to be viewed from slightly below.
[2969.54 --> 2971.60]  Because that's where most people position their TVs.
[2972.36 --> 2975.34]  Whether they're someone who puts it on their console and then sits on a couch.
[2975.52 --> 2976.06]  Or up on a wall.
[2976.06 --> 2977.78]  Or whether they put it up on a wall.
[2977.86 --> 2978.04]  Yeah.
[2978.04 --> 2984.48]  Or if they're one of those complete monsters who puts it, like, above their fireplace.
[2985.32 --> 2986.18]  It's wrong.
[2987.46 --> 2989.32]  It's wrong and you're wrong.
[2989.48 --> 2992.24]  I might be mounting mine to my standing desk above my monitors.
[2992.90 --> 2995.96]  So I can lower my standing desk as much as possible.
[2996.26 --> 2999.04]  So when you sit on the couch you can watch it more better.
[2999.16 --> 2999.90]  Because I don't have space.
[2999.90 --> 3006.78]  You know, you might be a legitimate use case for an 8K TV.
[3008.04 --> 3012.08]  You could just create virtual monitors on your 8K TV.
[3012.74 --> 3016.42]  And then when you want to watch TV, you just watch TV.
[3017.86 --> 3018.30]  Yeah.
[3018.30 --> 3020.68]  So Microsoft actually...
[3020.68 --> 3020.82]  Okay.
[3020.86 --> 3022.30]  I'm completely changing topics here.
[3024.26 --> 3024.98]  Power Toys.
[3025.06 --> 3026.92]  Microsoft just brought back Power Toys.
[3027.04 --> 3028.86]  Which I am personally very excited about.
[3029.76 --> 3033.86]  And two of the ones that they have just announced are...
[3034.86 --> 3035.36]  Dang it.
[3035.46 --> 3036.16]  Where can I...
[3036.16 --> 3037.06]  Where is this?
[3037.86 --> 3038.06]  Here.
[3038.12 --> 3038.30]  Whatever.
[3038.30 --> 3039.46]  Here's an article from The Verge.
[3040.16 --> 3041.22]  So one of them...
[3041.22 --> 3042.62]  Actually, they're both really cool.
[3042.98 --> 3043.68]  Fancy zones.
[3044.34 --> 3045.06]  This is sick.
[3046.26 --> 3047.18]  So you...
[3047.18 --> 3047.70]  It's like...
[3047.70 --> 3050.76]  It's like arrow snapping on, like, steroids.
[3051.12 --> 3051.36]  Whoa.
[3051.36 --> 3054.64]  So here's a whole bunch of different options for dividing up your desktop.
[3055.26 --> 3059.80]  And then if you go further in, you can actually customize it.
[3059.90 --> 3060.28]  No, no.
[3060.32 --> 3061.14]  Where's the custom one?
[3063.16 --> 3063.56]  No.
[3064.86 --> 3066.66]  I mean, this is already very cool.
[3066.66 --> 3070.56]  But there's a customization option later that they show where you can...
[3070.56 --> 3071.18]  Yeah, there you go.
[3071.36 --> 3073.64]  Where you can create, like, whatever the heck zones you want.
[3074.94 --> 3077.68]  Pretty freaking sick, if you ask me.
[3078.06 --> 3078.36]  That's...
[3078.36 --> 3079.60]  I think they're showing it right there.
[3079.76 --> 3081.02]  I think he was just setting up the zones.
[3081.18 --> 3081.30]  Oh.
[3081.72 --> 3082.02]  No.
[3082.18 --> 3082.32]  No.
[3082.36 --> 3083.96]  They never actually do a very good demo of it.
[3084.04 --> 3084.26]  Okay.
[3084.30 --> 3085.64]  It's more of an instructional video.
[3086.00 --> 3086.26]  Okay.
[3086.46 --> 3088.40]  And then what was the other really cool one?
[3088.68 --> 3089.54]  They're both cool.
[3090.22 --> 3090.90]  Blah, blah, blah.
[3090.94 --> 3091.34]  Oh, yeah.
[3091.52 --> 3094.94]  You can hold down the Windows key and discover keyboard shortcuts.
[3094.94 --> 3100.64]  So it'll just, like, show keyboard shortcuts on the screen and tell you what you can do with them.
[3100.88 --> 3102.08]  That is freaking awesome.
[3102.16 --> 3102.86]  That's really cool.
[3103.08 --> 3103.92]  Yay, Power Toys.
[3104.06 --> 3104.28]  Yeah.
[3105.00 --> 3105.40]  Anyway.
[3106.02 --> 3106.94]  So...
[3106.94 --> 3109.10]  Just, like, make my own monitor stuff?
[3109.10 --> 3113.68]  Because I have found an 8K TV, like, a 65-inch 8K TV.
[3114.14 --> 3118.00]  The pixel density is high enough that I can sit right in front of it.
[3119.06 --> 3122.12]  And, like, as long as you're not expecting a retina experience.
[3122.44 --> 3122.46]  No.
[3122.70 --> 3126.84]  As long as you're expecting something similar to, like, a 1440p 27-inch or something like that.
[3126.84 --> 3128.48]  That's actually all I want at that distance anyways.
[3128.54 --> 3129.12]  Like, reasonable?
[3129.38 --> 3129.56]  Yeah.
[3129.56 --> 3132.38]  You could create...
[3132.38 --> 3133.20]  So you could just...
[3133.20 --> 3137.22]  Man, if you've got an OLED, then you could just black out the parts you don't use.
[3137.42 --> 3139.98]  So you could be like, okay, I want to be in triple monitor mode.
[3142.18 --> 3142.66]  That's pretty smart.
[3142.66 --> 3143.20]  Okay, you know what?
[3143.22 --> 3144.34]  I want another monitor up here.
[3144.74 --> 3155.98]  That seems like the kind of thing that someone out there is probably working on, like, a weird, like, GitHub friggin' tiny program that, like, does this.
[3155.98 --> 3160.84]  It's like, I designed this for all the people who use 8K TVs as their monitors.
[3161.26 --> 3163.38]  I figure there's at least dozens of us.
[3163.42 --> 3164.48]  You know what would be super cool?
[3164.64 --> 3174.26]  Is if you opened a specific application, if it knew the zone that it wanted it in, and it, like, enabled that and put it there right away.
[3174.26 --> 3188.60]  So that, like, okay, if I open, like, this one desktop link that I have for, like, the status page for Floatplane, it's gonna open it, but it's gonna put it up there in the corner.
[3188.88 --> 3190.46]  Because I don't need to stare at this thing.
[3191.94 --> 3196.92]  Well, if it was an OLED, you wouldn't even need virtual desktops, because anything that doesn't have content on it would just be black.
[3196.92 --> 3202.18]  Yeah, but I'm saying, like, it would know to put it up there away from everything else.
[3202.36 --> 3202.70]  You know what I mean?
[3202.78 --> 3204.62]  Windows does a reasonably good job of that, doesn't it?
[3205.30 --> 3206.62]  Just putting stuff back where you left it?
[3206.96 --> 3207.62]  It's okay.
[3208.40 --> 3211.38]  This would be, because it would be, like, another Chrome window or whatever.
[3211.44 --> 3212.82]  Well, fancy zones can take care of that.
[3212.90 --> 3213.62]  That's what I'm saying.
[3214.34 --> 3214.66]  Yeah.
[3215.26 --> 3217.02]  It would be very nice if I could do that properly.
[3217.14 --> 3218.54]  That would be sick.
[3218.64 --> 3220.44]  Okay, on the subject of OLED, though.
[3220.58 --> 3220.80]  Yeah.
[3220.80 --> 3224.42]  So the advantage of the BFGD is obviously the high refresh rate.
[3224.54 --> 3230.80]  You can do HDR content up to 1080p, and I don't think you can do HDR at 144, because you're...
[3230.80 --> 3231.42]  Oh, I don't know.
[3231.46 --> 3233.42]  You might be able to, but you're dealing with chromosome...
[3233.42 --> 3233.62]  Whatever.
[3233.78 --> 3240.34]  Chromosop sampling sucks, because the argument that gets made by NVIDIA and their display partners
[3240.34 --> 3245.38]  is that, like, well, it's only really a factor when you're on the desktop, because it, like, makes text look bad.
[3245.92 --> 3247.96]  I'm like, lots of games have text, guys.
[3247.96 --> 3251.50]  So, yeah.
[3252.16 --> 3258.16]  So 144 doesn't make a ton of sense to me on it, but you can do 98 hertz with 10-bit color,
[3258.42 --> 3265.70]  or you can do 8-bit color at 120 hertz and get the full HDR experience on both of those.
[3268.46 --> 3269.24]  I don't know.
[3270.60 --> 3272.62]  It's got high refresh rate.
[3273.60 --> 3276.08]  It uses DisplayPort.
[3276.08 --> 3279.44]  It's got super low input lag.
[3279.58 --> 3282.88]  It's, like, it's basically having a gaming monitor in my living room.
[3283.22 --> 3286.16]  So I was playing some Super Meat Boy, and I was like, oh, yeah.
[3287.12 --> 3288.82]  Like, it just feels great.
[3288.82 --> 3297.78]  And when I was watching HDR content, because it's bright enough, it hits 1,000 nits peak brightness, even in the dark,
[3298.28 --> 3303.14]  I could definitely find Halos.
[3303.94 --> 3304.42]  Okay.
[3304.42 --> 3306.36]  But not with normal content on the screen.
[3306.36 --> 3312.16]  So, like, I wouldn't, like, I probably wouldn't, I probably want to turn it off.
[3312.22 --> 3317.62]  I probably want to turn off the full array local dimming if I was playing something like Anno, like a mouse-based game.
[3318.14 --> 3319.62]  But while watching movies...
[3319.62 --> 3322.64]  But in Anno, basically the whole screen is going to be lit the whole time.
[3322.76 --> 3323.50]  Yeah, kind of.
[3323.54 --> 3324.48]  The ocean's pretty dark.
[3324.90 --> 3325.26]  Is it?
[3325.28 --> 3326.36]  I found it kind of distracting.
[3326.36 --> 3326.68]  Okay.
[3326.78 --> 3326.92]  Yeah.
[3327.18 --> 3331.96]  I was going to say, like, if you played, like, a horror game, or, like, say you were playing, like, Halo,
[3332.14 --> 3336.32]  and you were going through one of the flood missions when it gets really dark sometimes,
[3336.66 --> 3338.92]  your, like, aimer and stuff is probably going to be pretty annoying.
[3339.36 --> 3339.76]  Mm-hmm.
[3339.92 --> 3342.08]  Because it's going to glow just around.
[3342.16 --> 3343.92]  It's going to almost feel like you have a flashlight on.
[3344.28 --> 3348.04]  So, basically, it finally got to the point where I'm willing to make that tradeoff.
[3348.38 --> 3348.68]  Right.
[3348.98 --> 3350.22]  In exchange for higher refresh rate.
[3350.22 --> 3356.80]  Now, with that said, OLED could be back in my living room sooner rather than later.
[3357.58 --> 3358.02]  Wait.
[3358.66 --> 3359.80]  Oh, I don't know if I can say this.
[3362.76 --> 3364.82]  For now, I'll be running the BFGD.
[3366.28 --> 3367.94]  Oh, here's the thing I can say.
[3368.40 --> 3373.96]  So, Dell actually showed off an Alienware 55-inch gaming OLED back at CES.
[3374.36 --> 3379.98]  So, if that or something like that were to come along soon, that could be a compelling option as well.
[3380.22 --> 3383.66]  Especially now that FreeSync displays can run G-Sync.
[3384.10 --> 3384.36]  Yeah.
[3384.80 --> 3389.14]  So, you're not, if you're, if you want to actually, you know, drive a 4K display,
[3389.54 --> 3395.80]  you're not stuck with, you know, screen tearing or ponying up for a G-Sync display.
[3396.04 --> 3398.66]  I will be very curious to see what their pricing looks like on that.
[3400.24 --> 3400.62]  Yeah.
[3400.86 --> 3401.40]  Super Chats?
[3401.68 --> 3402.00]  Yeah.
[3402.08 --> 3403.18]  Why don't we do some Super Chats?
[3405.26 --> 3406.68]  Let's have a look here, ladies and gentlemen.
[3406.68 --> 3409.54]  Kevin, ISAC said, mousepad news?
[3409.86 --> 3411.34]  The one in the video looked cool.
[3412.46 --> 3413.34]  No news yet.
[3413.86 --> 3414.60]  We're doing a mousepad.
[3414.88 --> 3415.22]  Oh, cool.
[3415.52 --> 3416.10]  It's going to be awesome.
[3416.30 --> 3417.04]  Is it a desk pad?
[3417.28 --> 3417.56]  Oh, yeah.
[3417.80 --> 3418.08]  Nice.
[3418.46 --> 3419.86]  Is there something else that exists?
[3419.96 --> 3420.92]  I'm just making sure.
[3421.04 --> 3422.12]  Because if there is, that's stupid.
[3423.62 --> 3426.52]  Hey, PowerPlay is awesome.
[3427.10 --> 3427.46]  PowerPlay?
[3428.06 --> 3428.42]  PowerPlay.
[3428.54 --> 3428.82]  Oh, yeah.
[3428.82 --> 3429.44]  That's pretty awesome.
[3429.76 --> 3429.92]  Yeah.
[3429.92 --> 3434.86]  Joshua says, can you create a way that Floatplane subscribers can watch via their Plex server?
[3434.96 --> 3437.84]  I don't think there's official integration, but I think, didn't someone in the community
[3437.84 --> 3438.94]  set something up?
[3438.94 --> 3440.12]  There's unofficial integration.
[3440.78 --> 3441.06]  Yeah.
[3441.26 --> 3443.18]  We might do something official at some point.
[3443.28 --> 3448.72]  We just have so many, like, hyper, high priority tasks right now, and we have for a while.
[3448.96 --> 3450.30]  But, yeah, we might do it eventually.
[3450.36 --> 3451.36]  Yeah, do you want to give them an update?
[3451.60 --> 3454.62]  Like, you guys have got kind of a crunch coming up for the 30th, if I recall correctly.
[3454.62 --> 3458.26]  We do, I wasn't going to announce it publicly, but we do.
[3458.88 --> 3459.48]  We might as well.
[3460.06 --> 3468.14]  Yeah, we're trying to get 4K support, although that has to be enabled by the creators, and
[3468.14 --> 3469.42]  plans have to be set up for that.
[3469.56 --> 3473.90]  And, like, there's, once it's done on our side, it's going to probably be a while before
[3473.90 --> 3475.12]  creators actually start using it.
[3475.70 --> 3476.74]  But 4K support.
[3477.02 --> 3477.70]  Yearly subscriptions.
[3477.84 --> 3480.16]  I know you guys have been asking for them for freaking ever.
[3480.58 --> 3481.54]  They are finally coming.
[3481.54 --> 3490.56]  Some backend improvements that we need, just for our own reasons, and some other fun stuff
[3490.56 --> 3491.00]  as well.
[3491.12 --> 3493.78]  The app continually gets better.
[3494.64 --> 3498.04]  If you've had frustrations with the app in the past, I recommend you use it again.
[3498.12 --> 3500.10]  The Chromecast support has gotten way better.
[3500.60 --> 3503.52]  You can now pull videos down and keep navigating the rest of the app.
[3503.84 --> 3505.14]  There's, like, a bunch of other cool features.
[3505.26 --> 3508.68]  The biggest update that the app has ever gotten launched this week.
[3509.62 --> 3511.34]  So, go check that out.
[3511.34 --> 3512.28]  It is a lot slicker.
[3512.62 --> 3515.22]  There was a quick little problem with it.
[3515.24 --> 3519.10]  I don't remember what it was with the auto rotation, and that's already been patched.
[3519.24 --> 3520.50]  So, yeah.
[3520.82 --> 3522.18]  Are we ever going to have an iOS app?
[3522.76 --> 3524.88]  We will eventually have an iOS app.
[3525.22 --> 3527.32]  Are we still actively developing it in parallel?
[3527.52 --> 3527.86]  Yes.
[3527.94 --> 3528.18]  Okay.
[3528.50 --> 3528.70]  Yeah.
[3528.78 --> 3532.00]  So, when it comes out, it should be basically pretty close to feature parity.
[3532.00 --> 3537.80]  So, the issues that Apple had, one of them was that if you went to go register for an account,
[3538.48 --> 3540.96]  you couldn't register for the account in the app.
[3541.50 --> 3542.56]  And they were like, no, no, no.
[3542.60 --> 3543.24]  We don't like that.
[3543.64 --> 3543.88]  Okay.
[3543.88 --> 3545.72]  And the other one was they were running it.
[3545.72 --> 3546.80]  That seems not trivial to fix.
[3547.86 --> 3549.16]  It's not as hard as you'd think.
[3549.30 --> 3549.60]  Okay.
[3549.86 --> 3550.86]  So, that's coming.
[3551.30 --> 3553.52]  But we didn't think it was important to be in this update.
[3553.84 --> 3554.44]  So, whatever.
[3555.34 --> 3559.28]  And then the other one was that it wasn't, like, working properly for them.
[3559.42 --> 3560.98]  But it's because they ran it in dev mode.
[3561.40 --> 3562.92]  And we, like, didn't expect them to do that.
[3563.36 --> 3563.58]  Oh.
[3563.76 --> 3565.12]  So, or debug mode.
[3566.50 --> 3567.84]  So, I don't know.
[3568.08 --> 3573.28]  It's, by the time we fix that stuff on our end, it's going to be, as far as I can tell,
[3573.34 --> 3577.80]  even though they say an average maximum of one day, every single time we've done anything
[3577.80 --> 3580.00]  with them, it's taken at least two weeks.
[3580.48 --> 3581.86]  So, it will probably be quite a while.
[3581.86 --> 3587.90]  Thanks to everyone who last week gave me leads on how to get in touch with Apple's PR.
[3588.38 --> 3589.58]  None of them panned out.
[3590.32 --> 3591.86]  To be clear, don't send me anymore.
[3592.08 --> 3595.28]  I have definitely reached the right people.
[3595.40 --> 3595.74]  They know.
[3596.02 --> 3596.56]  They know.
[3596.74 --> 3596.90]  Yeah.
[3596.98 --> 3600.20]  They have just decided that it is not worthwhile to engage with us.
[3600.30 --> 3602.18]  And they knew last week and they knew before last week.
[3602.18 --> 3602.42]  Yes.
[3602.50 --> 3607.02]  It's just, it's such a bizarre thing to me because their whole shtick is controlling the narrative.
[3607.48 --> 3610.54]  You can't control a narrative that you don't ever even deliver.
[3610.54 --> 3610.90]  Yeah.
[3610.90 --> 3612.18]  I don't know.
[3612.26 --> 3613.42]  It's just, it's bizarre.
[3613.70 --> 3616.62]  They're taking away their opportunity to get their voice in there.
[3619.08 --> 3619.78]  Yeah, boy.
[3620.00 --> 3620.36]  Thanks.
[3621.22 --> 3622.50]  Thanks, Home Automation X.
[3625.18 --> 3627.76]  Unusual user says, index set active.
[3630.58 --> 3630.94]  What?
[3630.94 --> 3632.78]  Thanks, doggo.
[3633.22 --> 3633.98]  Can I eat now?
[3634.22 --> 3635.60]  I think they'll let me eat while I do super chats.
[3635.78 --> 3636.82]  Maybe that can be the new rule.
[3637.72 --> 3639.98]  Rob says, watching from the Netherlands at two in the morning.
[3640.54 --> 3642.58]  What happened with not showing the kids on the channel anymore?
[3642.58 --> 3647.42]  It's not that I'm formally not showing the kids on the channel.
[3647.42 --> 3649.68]  I'm just not going out of my way to show them much.
[3650.42 --> 3653.26]  Or I'm going out of my way to not show them much.
[3653.74 --> 3658.90]  I mean, my son in particular really, really wants to make videos with dad.
[3658.90 --> 3662.18]  I still have misgivings about it.
[3662.34 --> 3663.62]  I may come around on that.
[3663.82 --> 3666.02]  I'm really not sure where I stand at this point.
[3667.30 --> 3667.82]  Thanks, Avian.
[3668.30 --> 3669.48]  Thanks, unusual user.
[3669.88 --> 3670.54]  Free desktop.
[3670.84 --> 3671.04]  Okay.
[3671.12 --> 3672.76]  I don't even know what you're talking about.
[3673.24 --> 3673.64]  Vlad.
[3673.64 --> 3677.44]  Any tips on a mobile for a 1066 gig and an 8700K?
[3679.30 --> 3680.06]  I don't know.
[3680.16 --> 3681.80]  Whatever one has the features you need.
[3681.84 --> 3683.34]  They don't affect performance much anymore.
[3684.00 --> 3686.62]  Just, you know, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI.
[3688.04 --> 3689.04]  Does it look cool?
[3691.24 --> 3693.92]  Yuri, I don't know how to pronounce that.
[3694.28 --> 3696.08]  So I finally subscribed to LTT on Floatplane.
[3696.30 --> 3698.04]  I have much feedback on UX.
[3698.60 --> 3701.82]  Is it better to unsubscribe or ignore LTT videos on YouTube?
[3701.82 --> 3704.60]  What is better for the YouTube algorithm and LTT prosperity?
[3706.62 --> 3707.14]  Wow.
[3707.26 --> 3707.82]  I don't really think...
[3708.36 --> 3716.82]  I don't really think any individual's behavior is going to have a large enough impact to affect us algorithmically.
[3717.46 --> 3720.06]  The best thing is obviously to just watch them.
[3720.50 --> 3722.10]  Watch the videos twice.
[3725.22 --> 3725.70]  Yeah.
[3726.12 --> 3730.44]  It's impossible for me to say whether it's better to unsubscribe and then ignore it
[3730.44 --> 3732.22]  or stay subscribed and then ignore it.
[3732.30 --> 3734.60]  I think it treats you exactly the same way regardless.
[3734.86 --> 3736.26]  So it should be fine.
[3737.40 --> 3739.16]  When will you do another house inspection?
[3739.90 --> 3742.04]  Maybe you mean tour, UT's.
[3742.68 --> 3744.68]  Or UTC or whatever that is.
[3744.84 --> 3746.36]  We are going to do some more stuff at my house.
[3746.44 --> 3749.08]  So I'm going to do a video on the BFDD upgrade.
[3749.08 --> 3756.12]  I have to upgrade my HTPC now that I have a 4K 120Hz gaming display in there.
[3756.20 --> 3757.50]  I'm just going to need a little bit more horsepower.
[3757.68 --> 3758.64]  I was running a 980 Ti.
[3759.38 --> 3761.92]  So yeah, that'll happen soon.
[3762.00 --> 3762.90]  We'll do a video about that.
[3764.26 --> 3765.28]  Not sure what that is.
[3765.38 --> 3767.84]  I don't know what usual user is talking about.
[3768.80 --> 3770.50]  They keep sending super chats.
[3771.66 --> 3773.68]  Hades says, do you think GeForce Now will ever get out of beta?
[3774.16 --> 3774.70]  Yeah, probably.
[3775.04 --> 3776.70]  They seem committed enough to it at this point.
[3776.70 --> 3780.24]  Sam says, can LMG sponsor my high school robotics team?
[3781.88 --> 3783.50]  Probably not.
[3783.70 --> 3785.46]  It never hurts to send an email though.
[3786.28 --> 3788.54]  MinusTechTips at gmail.com actually does get monitored.
[3788.68 --> 3790.12]  Please don't waste their time, guys.
[3792.12 --> 3794.80]  Corey, just want to spend more money to support LTT.
[3795.04 --> 3796.06]  Also, the merch store is the best.
[3796.16 --> 3796.92]  LTTstore.com.
[3796.98 --> 3797.46]  Thanks, Corey.
[3797.52 --> 3797.96]  Heck yeah.
[3798.88 --> 3802.70]  Ilya says, previously cheap iPhones always had something in their name showing that status.
[3803.20 --> 3805.68]  Now the hobo iPhone is just iPhone 11, which is kind of weird.
[3805.68 --> 3807.74]  Yes, but it also makes sense.
[3807.94 --> 3808.56]  You'll get used to it.
[3808.60 --> 3809.68]  It's iPhone vanilla.
[3809.88 --> 3810.88]  It's the normal one.
[3811.00 --> 3811.64]  The hobo one.
[3812.20 --> 3812.84]  It's a good name.
[3813.48 --> 3815.30]  Because like SE could be special edition.
[3815.54 --> 3815.80]  Mm-hmm.
[3816.34 --> 3817.04]  You know, R.
[3817.36 --> 3819.44]  Like GT versus a GTR.
[3819.98 --> 3820.98]  R sounds cooler.
[3821.32 --> 3821.66]  Type R?
[3821.86 --> 3822.36]  There you go.
[3822.72 --> 3825.84]  So no, the iPhone should just be like le iPhone.
[3826.14 --> 3826.38]  Yep.
[3826.38 --> 3827.72]  Excuse me.
[3827.84 --> 3828.88]  Should just be iPhone.
[3829.16 --> 3830.04]  Apple never says the.
[3830.14 --> 3830.78]  Have you noticed that?
[3831.42 --> 3832.50]  It's not the iPhone.
[3832.92 --> 3833.80]  It's not the Facebook.
[3834.12 --> 3834.28]  Yeah.
[3834.58 --> 3835.96]  Everybody got rid of the a while ago.
[3837.12 --> 3837.66]  Lord who?
[3837.76 --> 3838.14]  Hi, Sage.
[3838.18 --> 3838.70]  I'm on TV.
[3839.12 --> 3839.48]  All right.
[3840.64 --> 3843.20]  Morgan says, I swear I saw Linus holding a Zenfone 6.
[3843.30 --> 3844.06]  Is there a review coming?
[3844.06 --> 3844.54]  No.
[3845.38 --> 3845.74]  No.
[3845.92 --> 3847.44]  I ended up not doing a review of it.
[3847.48 --> 3851.24]  Because my first unit had some issues with the camera mechanism.
[3852.84 --> 3854.36]  So ASUS sent me another one.
[3854.58 --> 3856.26]  And then by that time it was kind of old news.
[3856.44 --> 3857.76]  And so I didn't end up reviewing it.
[3857.84 --> 3859.00]  Honestly, I wasn't a huge fan.
[3859.06 --> 3859.86]  The camera's not great.
[3861.54 --> 3862.60]  I think there are.
[3862.90 --> 3863.54]  The camera's not great.
[3863.56 --> 3863.66]  Yeah.
[3863.70 --> 3864.38]  The camera's not great.
[3864.72 --> 3868.14]  I think their flip around mechanism is not amazing.
[3871.88 --> 3872.24]  Yeah.
[3872.26 --> 3873.12]  I wasn't a huge fan.
[3873.12 --> 3877.10]  It's a good value if you're just looking for a high performance phone at a reasonable price.
[3877.18 --> 3878.64]  But there's a lot of options for that.
[3879.62 --> 3881.28]  Samuel says, Jono's awesome.
[3881.40 --> 3882.96]  One of the unsung heroes of LMG.
[3883.10 --> 3883.68]  Give this to him.
[3883.74 --> 3885.40]  That's not really how super chats work.
[3885.48 --> 3886.32]  But I'll tell him he's awesome.
[3887.72 --> 3888.94]  I'll send that message now.
[3892.52 --> 3897.02]  TechX, are either of you two interested in visiting the Star Wars land that opened at Disney?
[3897.12 --> 3898.74]  Or has Disney killed Star Wars for you?
[3899.06 --> 3899.42]  Wow.
[3899.60 --> 3899.86]  Go.
[3899.86 --> 3899.94]  Oh.
[3901.92 --> 3903.18]  I've wanted to go really badly.
[3904.50 --> 3906.56]  But I think I kind of want to go with someone.
[3907.58 --> 3911.28]  And coordinating schedules with adults to fly somewhere is like nearly impossible.
[3911.46 --> 3912.88]  So I don't know if I'll end up ever actually going.
[3913.56 --> 3915.70]  Disney has not ruined Star Wars for me.
[3915.70 --> 3918.92]  You just have to adopt a new mentality called headcanon.
[3919.62 --> 3921.70]  Where you just kind of decide what's real.
[3922.26 --> 3928.32]  And if you headcanon out all of the recent movies, everything's just better.
[3928.32 --> 3932.72]  I'm also legitimately pretty excited about The Mandalorian.
[3933.22 --> 3940.12]  And I'm legitimately pretty excited about the new Obi-Wan Kenobi show.
[3941.54 --> 3942.92]  Because it has Ewan McGregor in it.
[3942.92 --> 3943.46]  That's cheating.
[3943.88 --> 3944.26]  What do you mean?
[3944.26 --> 3947.56]  You can't just ignore the content.
[3947.94 --> 3948.78]  I think I can.
[3949.04 --> 3951.34]  I've been doing it quite actively and it's been pretty good.
[3951.44 --> 3951.62]  Okay.
[3951.70 --> 3954.70]  Are you watching the third from the latest trilogy?
[3954.94 --> 3955.76]  Are you going to go see it?
[3955.98 --> 3956.22]  Probably.
[3957.08 --> 3958.42]  And then you're going to ignore it?
[3958.58 --> 3958.82]  Yep.
[3959.64 --> 3960.04]  So.
[3960.36 --> 3962.22]  I need to know why I don't care.
[3962.22 --> 3968.22]  Because I think I care enough about it.
[3968.28 --> 3969.00]  If that makes sense.
[3970.12 --> 3970.86]  No, it doesn't.
[3970.88 --> 3973.28]  Or I'll wait to watch it on like a plane or something.
[3973.62 --> 3974.92]  I won't necessarily go see it in theater.
[3975.04 --> 3976.48]  I'm going to watch it at some point.
[3978.04 --> 3980.94]  But it doesn't matter to you that it just has no soul?
[3982.52 --> 3983.16]  What do you mean?
[3983.46 --> 3984.84]  It does matter to me that it has no soul.
[3985.38 --> 3986.24]  That's why I don't like it.
[3987.12 --> 3991.58]  But it's not dead to you because you choose to ignore the soul that's part of it.
[3991.58 --> 3995.34]  No, but people want to talk to me about it all the time because I talk about Star Wars stuff way too much.
[3995.56 --> 3998.52]  So I need to understand the context of why I don't like it.
[3999.02 --> 4001.76]  I can explain all the other recent movies.
[4002.40 --> 4004.56]  So I might as well be able to explain that one as well.
[4005.68 --> 4012.50]  I do have a lot of hope for The Mandalorian and the new Obi-Wan Kenobi show.
[4012.86 --> 4018.36]  Yeah, but isn't that exactly the definition of like a blind fanboy?
[4018.36 --> 4025.24]  Based on all evidence that points to the contrary, you keep having hope and you keep being let down.
[4025.46 --> 4026.96]  I have no hope for the movie.
[4028.04 --> 4029.52]  I only have hope for the shows.
[4030.24 --> 4030.70]  Really?
[4031.04 --> 4039.76]  And the Star Wars animated series is probably my favorite digital production Star Wars ever made.
[4040.34 --> 4040.68]  Okay.
[4040.68 --> 4047.42]  So mostly the later episodes and the episodes focused on the clones.
[4048.32 --> 4050.00]  But regardless.
[4050.26 --> 4050.52]  All right.
[4050.62 --> 4051.18]  It's dead to me.
[4051.48 --> 4052.38]  That's totally fine.
[4052.40 --> 4053.36]  I was always...
[4053.36 --> 4054.88]  I don't blame you at all, by the way.
[4054.88 --> 4059.50]  More of like the main movies and expanded universe guy.
[4059.64 --> 4064.40]  And then I like started a business and had kids and didn't really keep up for a long time.
[4064.56 --> 4069.50]  So I was really hoping that the new movies were going to be like really imaginative and suck me right back in.
[4069.74 --> 4069.86]  Yeah.
[4070.02 --> 4070.50]  And...
[4070.50 --> 4071.48]  They had so much opportunity there.
[4071.98 --> 4072.64]  They sucked.
[4072.86 --> 4073.06]  Yeah.
[4073.56 --> 4074.60]  But not me right back in.
[4074.64 --> 4075.10]  They just sucked.
[4075.20 --> 4075.36]  Yeah.
[4075.50 --> 4075.70]  Yeah.
[4075.92 --> 4078.58]  So I was never really into expanded universe.
[4078.66 --> 4079.98]  I tried to like them, by the way.
[4079.98 --> 4083.96]  So you'll be able to find Wancho clips of me talking about the merits of them.
[4085.12 --> 4088.90]  But the cold hard truth is I have not been...
[4088.90 --> 4094.46]  I have not experienced any temptation whatsoever to go back and re-watch them.
[4094.54 --> 4095.30]  It doesn't feel...
[4095.30 --> 4097.24]  And this is kind of funny because it's true.
[4097.60 --> 4099.94]  But it doesn't feel like it was made by someone who likes Star Wars.
[4101.46 --> 4106.12]  It feels like it was made by someone who has a really popular series that they know people are going to watch.
[4106.52 --> 4108.40]  And they're trying to do something with it.
[4108.40 --> 4110.72]  Instead of just liking Star Wars.
[4111.54 --> 4111.94]  You know what I mean?
[4112.16 --> 4112.30]  Yeah.
[4112.44 --> 4114.06]  And like that vibe comes across really heavily.
[4114.28 --> 4116.22]  I was never really that into expanded universe.
[4116.36 --> 4117.70]  Not because I didn't like it.
[4117.90 --> 4119.24]  Because I had no exposure to it.
[4119.64 --> 4120.54]  I didn't have any of the books.
[4120.82 --> 4121.06]  Right.
[4121.30 --> 4123.18]  I didn't have KOTOR.
[4123.30 --> 4125.20]  I didn't even know KOTOR was a thing.
[4125.24 --> 4126.10]  I never played KOTOR.
[4126.70 --> 4128.70]  I have played it a little bit on stream.
[4128.70 --> 4130.36]  I tried to get into it.
[4130.46 --> 4133.70]  But it was like a very last gen gaming experience.
[4134.58 --> 4134.70]  Yeah.
[4134.70 --> 4138.62]  Like I tried to play KOTOR after I had already played Dragon Age Origins.
[4138.62 --> 4142.80]  I tried to start playing KOTOR like a year and a half ago.
[4143.12 --> 4144.50]  Which was a little painful.
[4145.04 --> 4145.60]  But yeah.
[4145.66 --> 4146.94]  I had never gone into EU.
[4147.20 --> 4149.36]  And then I watched the first of the new movies.
[4149.50 --> 4150.04]  And I was like.
[4151.36 --> 4151.80]  Okay.
[4153.00 --> 4156.20]  There's only a few parts that I viciously hated.
[4156.94 --> 4157.28]  But.
[4157.28 --> 4158.92]  Some of it was okay.
[4159.04 --> 4160.42]  But they just like recreated an old movie.
[4161.06 --> 4163.62]  And then everything else since then was just way worse.
[4164.04 --> 4164.52]  So I was.
[4164.70 --> 4165.88]  I started getting more like.
[4166.52 --> 4167.08]  I like.
[4167.98 --> 4168.78]  The idea.
[4169.10 --> 4170.36]  I want to be more into Star Wars.
[4170.42 --> 4171.32]  I started diving into EU.
[4171.42 --> 4173.38]  And now I'm like super aggressively into Star Wars.
[4173.80 --> 4174.16]  But.
[4174.58 --> 4176.10]  Just the stuff that I want to be into.
[4176.34 --> 4178.40]  And I think you have to take that approach with EU.
[4178.62 --> 4179.52]  Because there's some.
[4180.56 --> 4182.04]  There's some not great stuff.
[4182.04 --> 4182.66]  In EU.
[4182.96 --> 4184.38]  But there's also some pure gold.
[4184.38 --> 4187.54]  Brandon says friends can be family.
[4188.02 --> 4188.18]  Aw.
[4188.80 --> 4189.22]  Gordon.
[4189.36 --> 4190.62]  If Spotify requires location.
[4190.76 --> 4191.46]  I'm canceling.
[4191.54 --> 4192.52]  Pick up title everyone.
[4192.82 --> 4193.06]  Wow.
[4193.22 --> 4194.02]  That's strong.
[4194.52 --> 4194.66]  Yeah.
[4195.06 --> 4195.42]  Dustin.
[4196.04 --> 4197.70]  Scrapyard Wars idea.
[4198.04 --> 4200.12]  Budget used Unraid server computer.
[4201.14 --> 4201.94]  That's tough.
[4202.06 --> 4204.94]  Because most of what makes up the cost of a storage server.
[4205.10 --> 4205.94]  Is hard drives.
[4205.98 --> 4206.62]  Which are commodity.
[4206.76 --> 4208.48]  Which are hard to find a deal on.
[4208.72 --> 4209.94]  And if you're buying them.
[4210.02 --> 4210.94]  Use their kind of sketch.
[4211.36 --> 4212.24]  Tommy Gunn says.
[4212.32 --> 4213.86]  Was just watching whole room water cooling again.
[4213.86 --> 4215.64]  You need more of those crazy projects.
[4216.56 --> 4218.40]  I think you guys do a lot of crazy projects these days.
[4218.46 --> 4219.30]  Matter of time.
[4219.52 --> 4220.56]  You'll see crazy projects.
[4220.76 --> 4223.50]  Alex is actively working on the red camera water cooling right now.
[4224.02 --> 4224.42]  And.
[4224.92 --> 4227.32]  I have a concept for whole home water cooling.
[4227.64 --> 4228.28]  Oh god.
[4228.42 --> 4229.86]  That would be different from the other one.
[4229.98 --> 4231.68]  And probably not corrode this time.
[4232.00 --> 4232.62]  Oh there you go.
[4232.68 --> 4232.82]  Yeah.
[4232.90 --> 4233.96]  So I'm pretty excited about that.
[4234.96 --> 4236.30]  Clay Toyo says.
[4236.70 --> 4237.68]  Here's 50 bucks.
[4237.90 --> 4239.46]  Just got a computer technician job.
[4239.54 --> 4240.36]  Straight out of high school.
[4240.46 --> 4241.14]  Using my knowledge.
[4241.14 --> 4243.88]  Which I can almost credit everything to LTT and TechWiki.
[4244.74 --> 4245.14]  Wow.
[4245.52 --> 4245.94]  That's awesome.
[4245.94 --> 4247.72]  I think you guys deserve some of my first paycheck.
[4247.96 --> 4249.38]  Well thank you very much.
[4249.48 --> 4250.16]  Glad to help.
[4251.12 --> 4251.68]  Andrew says.
[4251.78 --> 4253.54]  I got screen burning from Tiny Tower.
[4253.92 --> 4256.62]  Left it on overnight for days to get more coins.
[4256.76 --> 4256.88]  Yeah.
[4257.26 --> 4258.20]  I hear that.
[4258.36 --> 4259.04]  Sebastian says.
[4259.12 --> 4260.38]  OMG first time live.
[4260.52 --> 4261.42]  Hello from Romania.
[4262.72 --> 4263.88]  Hey milk or fish.
[4264.82 --> 4267.80]  New 3DS has eye tracking that moves the 3D sweet spot.
[4267.80 --> 4268.24]  Interesting.
[4270.72 --> 4271.58]  Nope says.
[4271.72 --> 4273.28]  Was on Pornhub the other day.
[4273.40 --> 4274.78]  There's LTT videos there.
[4275.54 --> 4276.50]  Good to know.
[4278.06 --> 4278.76]  Robert says.
[4278.80 --> 4280.10]  The mic really does pick up everything.
[4280.34 --> 4281.58]  Beep beep goes the alarm system.
[4281.88 --> 4282.68]  Kraken Skull says.
[4282.76 --> 4283.42]  Love your content.
[4283.50 --> 4284.66]  Would love to see a Homelab type video.
[4284.74 --> 4286.26]  Where you buy old Enterprise gear on eBay.
[4286.36 --> 4286.52]  Oh.
[4286.90 --> 4288.76]  I might have a sponsor for the Krakenator.
[4289.44 --> 4289.94]  Oh really?
[4290.10 --> 4290.32]  Yeah.
[4290.52 --> 4292.08]  We might be able to actually do that project.
[4292.94 --> 4293.76]  That's kind of fun.
[4293.88 --> 4294.24]  I haven't.
[4294.32 --> 4296.08]  I don't think I've told anyone at FullPlan about it.
[4296.08 --> 4297.10]  But that's fun.
[4298.46 --> 4299.16]  Blake says.
[4299.24 --> 4299.98]  With Channel Super Fun.
[4300.04 --> 4301.42]  You should definitely play Quidditch.
[4301.44 --> 4302.66]  With one of the local teams.
[4305.46 --> 4306.02]  I think.
[4306.12 --> 4307.14]  I think if we bring it back.
[4307.26 --> 4308.54]  It should be more about toys again.
[4308.72 --> 4309.00]  Yeah.
[4309.34 --> 4310.38]  That's my personal opinion.
[4310.38 --> 4311.70]  I think with that suggestion.
[4311.70 --> 4312.44]  We're done here.
[4313.72 --> 4314.30]  I don't know.
[4314.38 --> 4314.54]  We might.
[4314.64 --> 4314.98]  Who knows.
[4315.04 --> 4315.30]  We might.
[4315.54 --> 4316.58]  So thanks for watching guys.
[4316.76 --> 4317.50]  See you again next week.
[4317.58 --> 4318.12]  Same bad time.
[4318.12 --> 4318.92]  Same bad channel.
[4322.52 --> 4322.92]  Quidditch.
[4324.38 --> 4325.10]  Oh boy.
[4325.10 --> 4326.48]  Have you like.
[4326.66 --> 4327.80]  Watched the YouTube videos.
[4327.86 --> 4328.78]  Of people playing Quidditch.
[4331.16 --> 4332.34]  Or may they still do it.
[4333.34 --> 4334.30]  That's some dedication.
