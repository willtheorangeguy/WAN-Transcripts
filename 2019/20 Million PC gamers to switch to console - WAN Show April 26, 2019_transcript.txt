[0.96 --> 2.96]  Yeah, should work now. There we go.
[3.88 --> 7.50]  Hey, welcome to the WAN show.
[11.04 --> 13.00]  Ah, sorry about that.
[13.98 --> 16.36]  Um, so, you know what?
[16.78 --> 18.46]  This is what happens when I leave you in charge.
[19.06 --> 19.58]  Wow.
[21.18 --> 21.62]  Wow.
[21.92 --> 24.06]  I think that's the only reasonable explanation.
[24.32 --> 27.40]  I think this is what happens when you leave the Linus Tech Tips crew
[27.40 --> 30.92]  as responsible for anything technical pretty much ever.
[31.00 --> 32.24]  No, I think this is what...
[32.24 --> 33.50]  Hey, we need to stream something.
[33.76 --> 34.56]  Well, that's fine.
[34.78 --> 37.04]  We'll just, you know, we'll use a streaming cart
[37.04 --> 39.84]  instead of our streaming PC that's dedicated but never works
[39.84 --> 41.18]  and has needed to reformat for months.
[41.46 --> 42.10]  That's no big deal.
[42.22 --> 45.02]  We'll just roll this over and then not set up an audio solution at all.
[45.02 --> 46.74]  This is what happens when I leave you in charge.
[47.16 --> 48.72]  Yeah, that's how it's going to be.
[48.72 --> 52.22]  Or set up any of the software needed to make thumbnails
[52.22 --> 54.72]  or pretty much anything at all.
[55.06 --> 55.48]  Yeah, sick.
[55.48 --> 56.42]  So we're live.
[56.42 --> 61.36]  You know what's hilarious is we actually did a sponsored live stream
[61.36 --> 62.36]  for this product.
[62.54 --> 63.96]  It's called the GoXLR.
[64.26 --> 65.04]  Yeah, it just saved us.
[65.80 --> 70.48]  And it just completely saved our bacon
[70.48 --> 73.94]  because we didn't have the drivers for our Focusrite thing
[73.94 --> 76.36]  on the one stream machine.
[76.50 --> 79.90]  And then we've had this ongoing issue with the other one
[79.90 --> 82.14]  where it just hasn't been stable.
[82.32 --> 84.38]  Like we've been dropping frames for some reason.
[84.38 --> 85.44]  In very weird ways.
[85.44 --> 85.76]  Yeah.
[85.76 --> 90.70]  So basically, I blame Jake.
[90.70 --> 94.58]  I really want to turn these headphones there.
[94.58 --> 95.06]  Yeah, I was just going to say.
[95.06 --> 95.74]  Okay, that was easy.
[95.96 --> 96.36]  Yeah.
[96.64 --> 97.20]  Yay.
[98.24 --> 100.36]  And oh, oh, actually, oh, I shouldn't.
[101.08 --> 101.90]  Oh, I need to know.
[101.98 --> 103.50]  I need to know if the swear button works.
[103.98 --> 104.48]  Hey, Luke.
[104.48 --> 108.86]  So we're going to know if that works.
[108.86 --> 109.82]  Oh, boy.
[109.82 --> 111.90]  Oh, boy.
[111.96 --> 113.50]  We've got a great show for you guys today.
[113.60 --> 114.64]  It's going to be a little late.
[114.84 --> 117.58]  It's probably going to be a little short because I have big news.
[118.22 --> 124.20]  I am finally starting the interviews for the writing position for Linus Tech Tips.
[124.28 --> 126.44]  Actually, the couple of writing positions that we're hiring for.
[126.44 --> 131.72]  So it's taken me a long time to get through all the applications.
[131.94 --> 133.28]  There were a freaking ton of them.
[133.54 --> 134.86]  I'm actually not all the way through.
[135.00 --> 135.72]  How many did you get?
[135.78 --> 136.20]  But I'm starting.
[136.32 --> 137.44]  I got a couple hundred.
[139.88 --> 140.24]  What?
[140.56 --> 141.52]  I'm at 2,000.
[142.32 --> 144.18]  Oh, well, people must want to work for Coldplay.
[144.22 --> 144.54]  What?
[145.08 --> 146.72]  How do you have a couple hundred?
[146.72 --> 152.86]  Okay, so the way that I got a couple hundred was that in order to even make it to my inbox,
[153.40 --> 154.18]  you had to write...
[154.18 --> 155.52]  Oh, a couple hundred got to you.
[155.54 --> 157.02]  A complete sample script.
[157.14 --> 157.90]  Okay, okay.
[157.98 --> 158.30]  Oh, yeah.
[158.56 --> 159.18]  Oh, yeah.
[159.48 --> 161.36]  I was like, there's something.
[161.84 --> 162.52]  We're off here.
[162.52 --> 166.66]  Every single one of them has already invested hours into their application,
[167.12 --> 170.06]  at least assuming that they expect to have any chance whatsoever.
[170.56 --> 171.20]  Wow, okay.
[171.36 --> 172.48]  Yeah, that makes sense.
[172.56 --> 176.06]  I'm interviewing anywhere between 15 and 20 of them.
[176.06 --> 177.82]  I thought you meant you got that many, like, resumes.
[178.14 --> 178.98]  Oh, no, no, no.
[178.98 --> 179.18]  Yeah.
[179.40 --> 183.14]  Well, we didn't even accept resumes until people answered the skill testing questions.
[183.54 --> 183.76]  Okay.
[183.76 --> 186.42]  And then once they submitted their initial application,
[186.60 --> 188.32]  we sent them back a package that was like,
[188.72 --> 192.60]  here is all the work that you have to do in order to even apply.
[193.14 --> 196.60]  And, I mean, the idea is, like, you're trying to filter out the people that just...
[197.26 --> 198.00]  All right, that into it.
[198.40 --> 200.28]  All right, oh, that seems like a lot of work.
[200.38 --> 200.80]  Well, you know what?
[200.86 --> 202.28]  Working here is a lot of work, so...
[202.28 --> 203.12]  You did that to me.
[203.38 --> 203.74]  I did.
[203.96 --> 204.16]  Yeah.
[204.16 --> 206.32]  I actually had to find that email.
[206.42 --> 209.08]  I'm not even going to go into why, but I had to find that email recently.
[209.24 --> 210.88]  I would love to know why.
[211.20 --> 212.22]  U.S. tax stuff.
[212.36 --> 212.68]  Oh.
[212.82 --> 213.38]  I had to...
[213.38 --> 214.78]  Okay, guess this.
[215.02 --> 215.98]  I had to figure out...
[215.98 --> 216.74]  This part was easy.
[216.96 --> 220.42]  I had to figure out the names of all the employers that I had from 2010 to 2016.
[220.80 --> 224.34]  So I had to figure out when I started working with NCX.
[224.44 --> 224.92]  Got it.
[224.92 --> 227.80]  It wasn't an employer relationship, but they're still interested in that, right?
[227.80 --> 231.90]  And I had to figure out when I was working at Canada Bread Factory.
[232.42 --> 232.58]  Right.
[232.64 --> 233.42]  Whether or not that was...
[233.42 --> 233.56]  Whatever.
[233.64 --> 234.04]  That doesn't matter.
[234.34 --> 240.12]  The next thing was, I had to figure out all of the entry and exit dates of me into the
[240.12 --> 243.00]  U.S. between 2010 and 2016.
[243.00 --> 248.94]  It's funny, because like 2010, PAX.
[249.18 --> 250.48]  2011, PAX.
[251.68 --> 253.32]  2012, PAX.
[253.78 --> 255.32]  2013, uh...
[255.32 --> 255.72]  Everywhere.
[255.98 --> 257.00]  2014, what?
[259.00 --> 262.50]  It just became a complete mess after that.
[262.78 --> 264.50]  The first few years were so easy.
[264.72 --> 265.52]  And then everything went downhill.
[265.52 --> 266.26]  Full cluster f***.
[266.52 --> 266.78]  Oh.
[267.10 --> 267.42]  Oh.
[267.76 --> 268.48]  Yeah, right?
[268.48 --> 271.80]  Oh, it's so much fun.
[271.86 --> 272.40]  That's crazy.
[272.92 --> 273.28]  Anyways.
[273.28 --> 273.44]  Anyways.
[273.64 --> 275.00]  So, let's get into some tech news.
[275.10 --> 277.22]  That's kind of our New Year's resolution for the WAN shows.
[277.36 --> 278.28]  We're going to do that first.
[278.62 --> 281.88]  And then we'll talk, because we've got stuff to talk about, actually.
[282.14 --> 282.28]  Oh.
[282.76 --> 283.20]  Yeah.
[283.42 --> 284.34]  I...
[284.34 --> 285.66]  The coolest project ever.
[285.98 --> 286.70]  Oh, yeah.
[286.92 --> 288.26]  It's actually really sweet.
[288.26 --> 291.54]  Don't miss this video, because it's really cool.
[292.12 --> 293.48]  Anyway, I will...
[293.48 --> 293.76]  Oh, yeah.
[293.86 --> 294.46]  What are we doing?
[294.96 --> 295.36]  For...
[295.36 --> 295.76]  For...
[295.76 --> 296.32]  For...
[296.32 --> 298.46]  For...
[298.46 --> 303.18]  Fortnite's success led to months of crunch time at Epic Games.
[303.64 --> 309.82]  Uh, 20 million PC gamers projected to switch to consoles by 2022.
[310.12 --> 311.98]  Not if I have anything to say about it!
[312.66 --> 316.34]  And the 2021 Intel roadmap has potentially leaked.
[317.00 --> 317.32]  Ooh.
[317.54 --> 318.08]  Oh, my.
[318.18 --> 318.66]  Oh, my.
[318.78 --> 319.50]  Oh, jeez.
[319.78 --> 320.02]  All right.
[320.08 --> 320.76]  Let's roll that intro.
[321.38 --> 322.26]  Assuming that it's here.
[323.08 --> 323.40]  Oh.
[324.40 --> 325.08]  Oh, boy.
[325.24 --> 325.74]  Oh, is it just...
[325.74 --> 326.00]  Oh, boy.
[326.32 --> 327.16]  It's at the end.
[327.16 --> 327.96]  Uh...
[327.96 --> 328.16]  Uh...
[328.16 --> 329.22]  I don't...
[329.22 --> 330.26]  I don't know if it's playing.
[330.50 --> 331.00]  Should go...
[331.00 --> 331.46]  Wait.
[331.80 --> 332.82]  Why is that...
[332.82 --> 333.84]  Is this not visible?
[335.36 --> 335.80]  Uh...
[335.80 --> 335.98]  Wait.
[336.10 --> 336.26]  What?
[336.26 --> 336.54]  No, it is.
[336.58 --> 337.44]  It's probably just white.
[337.86 --> 338.66]  Oh, what?
[339.36 --> 340.74]  Is it not transparent?
[340.98 --> 341.20]  Wait.
[341.26 --> 341.46]  What?
[342.18 --> 342.58]  Order.
[343.26 --> 343.82]  Move up?
[344.26 --> 344.48]  No.
[344.48 --> 344.66]  No.
[344.66 --> 344.88]  No.
[345.18 --> 347.76]  I would just maybe go into properties and restart it.
[348.60 --> 349.00]  Properties.
[349.66 --> 350.36]  Oh, wait.
[350.42 --> 350.52]  No.
[350.60 --> 351.02]  Not loop.
[351.60 --> 352.52]  Loop should work.
[352.62 --> 352.74]  No.
[352.90 --> 353.38]  Restart.
[353.82 --> 354.54]  Restart playback.
[354.76 --> 354.94]  Yeah.
[355.00 --> 355.10]  No.
[355.12 --> 355.78]  This should be right.
[356.42 --> 356.78]  No.
[356.92 --> 357.04]  No.
[357.08 --> 357.20]  No.
[357.20 --> 357.70]  It doesn't...
[357.70 --> 358.24]  That's...
[358.24 --> 358.46]  Yeah.
[358.58 --> 359.68]  It probably doesn't have it mapped.
[359.76 --> 360.12]  No.
[360.62 --> 361.06]  Okay.
[361.26 --> 361.78]  Uh...
[361.78 --> 363.32]  Brought to you by Madrina's.
[363.32 --> 364.10]  Carrying a couch.
[364.34 --> 364.62]  Uh...
[364.62 --> 365.26]  Dropping it.
[365.44 --> 365.86]  Oh, wow.
[365.94 --> 366.04]  No.
[366.10 --> 366.82]  None of these are working.
[366.96 --> 367.20]  Uh...
[367.20 --> 368.10]  Dying in a swamp.
[368.16 --> 368.86]  That's not working.
[368.94 --> 370.76]  Brought to you by Displate Moss and Madrina's.
[370.76 --> 371.26]  That...
[371.26 --> 371.66]  Oh, boy.
[371.94 --> 372.30]  Hey.
[372.30 --> 374.44]  Oh, boy.
[374.70 --> 375.62]  The setup of this...
[375.62 --> 376.94]  Our lower third isn't here either.
[377.40 --> 377.76]  Perfection.
[378.90 --> 379.14]  Yeah.
[379.18 --> 380.26]  Our lower third's not here.
[380.70 --> 381.34]  This is...
[381.34 --> 381.98]  This is great.
[382.40 --> 383.72]  Um...
[383.72 --> 384.36]  Um...
[384.36 --> 384.94]  You know what?
[385.02 --> 385.78]  It's fine.
[386.18 --> 386.76]  That's...
[386.76 --> 386.94]  Wait.
[387.02 --> 387.12]  No.
[387.16 --> 387.74]  This is mapped.
[387.82 --> 388.58]  This is mapped even.
[389.08 --> 389.20]  Oh!
[390.48 --> 391.40]  Did you see that?
[391.40 --> 391.58]  Yeah.
[391.66 --> 392.00]  You just...
[392.00 --> 393.02]  Is the intro gonna work now?
[393.02 --> 393.20]  Yeah.
[393.26 --> 397.88]  So, you know that stupid thing where you've got a network drive and it's just X'd off, even
[397.88 --> 401.36]  though as soon as you double click it, like zero latency, boom, it goes right in.
[401.92 --> 404.44]  All I had to do was do that and I bet the intro will play.
[405.58 --> 405.86]  Okay.
[406.00 --> 406.32]  Hold on.
[406.40 --> 407.02]  It's not...
[408.54 --> 409.02]  Uh...
[409.02 --> 409.28]  Nope.
[410.00 --> 411.04]  That's not working.
[411.26 --> 413.46]  Well, we got part of the way there.
[415.46 --> 416.70]  Pre-order a water bottle.
[416.94 --> 417.82]  LTTstore.com.
[417.92 --> 418.20]  Yeah.
[419.12 --> 419.82]  All right.
[420.40 --> 422.74]  Let's get into our first big news.
[423.02 --> 423.42]  Love the week.
[424.50 --> 427.18]  Fortnite's success led to months of crunch at Epic Games.
[427.24 --> 430.34]  Now, you know some people in the game development industry, don't you?
[430.42 --> 430.58]  Okay.
[430.66 --> 431.22]  So, let's...
[431.22 --> 435.00]  First, let's talk about what the situation is like at Epic Games and then why don't we
[435.00 --> 438.44]  talk about what we know about working in the games industry in general.
[439.12 --> 439.76]  And...
[439.76 --> 439.96]  Okay.
[440.04 --> 445.74]  So, basically, this was originally posted up by Polygon and it was posted by Luke Savinage
[445.74 --> 446.88]  on the forum.
[447.50 --> 451.18]  And, in a nutshell, Fortnite's explosive growth.
[451.18 --> 459.68]  Like, the thing is, every game company hopes that their game is going to be the next insert.
[459.88 --> 460.46]  You know, PUBG.
[461.58 --> 462.76]  That bejeweled.
[463.00 --> 464.02]  Something that...
[464.02 --> 464.30]  Peggle.
[464.42 --> 466.10]  Something that, like, really explodes.
[466.18 --> 468.24]  And they're basically just printing money.
[470.46 --> 470.90]  Anyway.
[471.46 --> 472.12]  Talk about it later.
[472.12 --> 475.06]  But, that doesn't mean that they're necessarily prepared for it.
[475.32 --> 479.00]  And the thing is, is that you might think, okay, well, you built the game.
[479.64 --> 481.94]  Now, basically, it's all gravy then, right?
[481.94 --> 482.34]  Retain.
[482.52 --> 484.68]  But it is not that simple.
[484.88 --> 485.12]  And for Fortnite...
[485.12 --> 485.62]  Not to work.
[485.88 --> 488.06]  For Fortnite in particular, for a couple of reasons.
[488.18 --> 492.56]  Number one is, as the game scales, their infrastructure has to scale in...
[492.56 --> 493.84]  Is that even in a linear manner?
[494.00 --> 496.10]  Or would it have to scale-er more-er?
[497.42 --> 498.74]  Probably scale-er more-er.
[498.86 --> 500.94]  Especially because they're going to get attacked and whatever else.
[501.20 --> 501.40]  Yeah.
[501.78 --> 507.68]  Furthermore, because it's a free-to-play model game, it's not like you just ship it, burn
[507.68 --> 512.48]  it to a CD, put it in the mail to the customer, and you're done.
[512.62 --> 513.50]  Especially with Fortnite.
[513.60 --> 514.70]  They're releasing new content.
[514.86 --> 515.70]  They're editing the map.
[515.78 --> 516.98]  They're doing all this stuff constantly.
[516.98 --> 524.32]  So, basically, what the report says is that Fortnite's explosive growth led to months of
[524.32 --> 525.18]  intense crunch.
[525.64 --> 527.02]  And intense crunch is no...
[527.02 --> 529.52]  The gaming industry is no stranger to intense crunch.
[529.64 --> 529.80]  Oh, yeah.
[529.80 --> 535.04]  When you're coming up against a major patch, or an expansion, a big DLC, or, I mean, of course,
[535.14 --> 535.98]  the launch of the game.
[536.36 --> 542.70]  When we were at Monolith, they were saying that the number of people in that studio then,
[542.70 --> 547.96]  when they were working on DLCs and stuff, was nothing compared to the number of people
[547.96 --> 552.52]  that were crammed into that place in the weeks leading up to the launch, just finishing up
[552.52 --> 553.54]  all those last-minute things.
[554.14 --> 560.26]  But, normally, that doesn't happen indefinitely, with no light at the end of the tunnel.
[560.36 --> 565.44]  So, they're saying it led to months of intense crunch for Epic employees and contractors, some
[565.44 --> 570.62]  of whom said they felt extreme pressure to work grueling hours to maintain Fortnite's success
[570.62 --> 574.48]  and profitability, resulting in a toxic, stressful environment at the company.
[574.70 --> 577.18]  I also believe only contract staff were paid overtime.
[577.64 --> 583.94]  So, while officially voluntary, working overtime was basically like an expected service to
[583.94 --> 584.36]  the company.
[584.48 --> 587.26]  This is what is being reported, at the very least.
[587.80 --> 593.38]  Now, contract staff say they were paid overtime, but some employees reported suffering health
[593.38 --> 596.72]  issues after working consecutive months of 70-hour weeks.
[596.72 --> 598.08]  I mean, put that in context.
[598.48 --> 604.62]  Assuming that you're working five days, that would be 14 hours a day?
[604.72 --> 610.46]  You're basically going home, collapsing in your bed, getting up, and going to work.
[610.64 --> 614.12]  And you might say, well, yeah, but all you do is sit at a computer.
[614.74 --> 617.30]  Well, for one thing, no, not necessarily.
[617.62 --> 617.86]  Yeah.
[618.00 --> 622.58]  I mean, at Monolith, in particular, did you know that they actually have their game developers
[622.58 --> 628.52]  go into their motion cap room and, like, mocap stuff?
[628.54 --> 629.02]  It's so cool.
[629.02 --> 630.06]  The reasoning for that is actually super cool.
[630.10 --> 630.70]  Oh, I know, right?
[630.70 --> 631.28]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[631.42 --> 636.04]  So, the reasoning for that is because they don't want the armor and stuff that they can't
[636.04 --> 638.20]  be wearing during the mocap to clip.
[638.50 --> 638.68]  Yeah.
[638.82 --> 640.34]  So, the game developers know that.
[640.44 --> 642.52]  So, they'll, like, change things to make it work.
[642.58 --> 643.16]  Super cool.
[643.16 --> 647.66]  And so, mocap actors wouldn't be able to compensate for, like, I'm, like, this jacked
[647.66 --> 648.98]  dude doing this move.
[649.26 --> 652.34]  You know, how do my muscles not clip on my other giant muscles?
[652.72 --> 653.22]  You know?
[653.88 --> 655.32]  So, they can make sure that they do it.
[655.34 --> 658.08]  And some of them were actually, like, like, I was looking at it.
[658.08 --> 658.42]  Pretty good.
[658.42 --> 659.14]  You got training.
[659.30 --> 659.48]  Yeah.
[659.56 --> 660.26]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[660.58 --> 660.82]  So.
[661.06 --> 662.56]  I bet you they did specifically for that.
[662.70 --> 666.44]  So, yeah, those guys don't specifically sit at a desk.
[666.52 --> 670.54]  And furthermore, sitting at a desk is mentally fatiguing in a way that people who haven't
[670.54 --> 672.50]  had a desk job might not actually understand.
[672.50 --> 673.42]  Problem solving all day.
[673.96 --> 675.62]  And creating things all day.
[675.94 --> 677.62]  So, this is a quote from one employee.
[677.84 --> 680.16]  I work an average of 70 hours a week.
[680.48 --> 684.12]  There's probably at least 50 to 100 other people at Epic working those hours.
[684.36 --> 686.86]  And I know people who pull 100 hour weeks.
[687.14 --> 688.30]  Just, like, okay.
[689.00 --> 693.22]  The company gives us unlimited time off, but it's almost impossible to take that time.
[693.56 --> 696.78]  If I take time off, the workload falls on other people and no one wants to be that
[696.78 --> 697.06]  guy.
[697.06 --> 697.14]  Anyway.
[698.26 --> 703.14]  So, back to what we were discussing about what the free-to-play model means for game
[703.14 --> 704.06]  developers in general.
[704.76 --> 711.28]  Games as a service sort of creates this constant refresh of deadlines.
[711.84 --> 713.84]  It's almost kind of like working here.
[713.84 --> 720.22]  So, you launch a video at noon that day or whatever.
[720.66 --> 726.26]  And it's like, you press live and you're like, okay, are there any major technical issues?
[726.40 --> 727.72]  How's the audience sentiment?
[728.86 --> 729.30]  Okay.
[730.22 --> 730.94]  On to the next one.
[730.94 --> 731.14]  Next video.
[731.24 --> 731.62]  Here we go.
[733.62 --> 734.86]  Crunch time is all the time.
[734.90 --> 738.30]  And the biggest problem is that they're patching all the time.
[738.30 --> 742.58]  The executives are focused on keeping Fortnite popular for as long as possible.
[742.90 --> 745.08]  Because I'm sure that they're smart enough.
[745.28 --> 745.56]  Okay.
[745.62 --> 746.90]  Not every executive is smart enough.
[746.98 --> 750.42]  But I'm sure they have an executive that's smart enough.
[750.56 --> 751.56]  I'm sure Sweeney knows.
[751.98 --> 755.52]  To know that no game stays dominant forever.
[756.22 --> 757.64]  It doesn't happen.
[757.74 --> 758.92]  That's not a thing that exists.
[759.34 --> 762.76]  So, it's all about making hay while the sun's shining.
[762.76 --> 772.02]  If you can make three, four, five billion dollars on just 18 months of popularity, that's your chance.
[772.20 --> 776.16]  It's not like you can pace yourself and be like, okay, we're going to take it easy.
[776.26 --> 779.70]  We're going to make our two billion dollars and then we'll make the other three billion dollars.
[780.08 --> 781.54]  You might not get a chance.
[781.62 --> 783.02]  You might not get a crack at that.
[783.54 --> 787.66]  So, we're not allowed to spend time on anything.
[787.66 --> 789.84]  If something breaks, a weapon.
[790.16 --> 793.60]  We can't just turn that weapon off and fix it in the next patch.
[793.76 --> 795.46]  It must be fixed immediately.
[795.92 --> 798.56]  And all the while, we still have to be working on next week's patch.
[799.06 --> 803.18]  And you think about how disruptive that would be to your workflow.
[803.74 --> 806.98]  For example, a real-time operating system, for example.
[807.48 --> 808.64]  If you have...
[808.64 --> 809.68]  That's why.
[810.18 --> 812.36]  Do you ever wonder why you click something sometimes?
[812.50 --> 813.58]  In Windows, say.
[814.38 --> 815.94]  And your click doesn't register.
[815.94 --> 819.02]  And you go, well, like a click is the simplest thing ever.
[819.56 --> 820.80]  How is there a delay on that?
[820.84 --> 823.20]  It's because Windows is not a real-time operating system.
[823.88 --> 824.92]  Those do exist.
[825.02 --> 827.80]  They're mostly for embedded systems, things like medical devices.
[828.26 --> 835.24]  And for things like that, where timing is absolutely critical, when that input happens, the response is triggered.
[835.24 --> 840.44]  But what that means is any other background processes, boom, interrupted.
[840.86 --> 841.20]  Done.
[841.34 --> 841.74]  You're done.
[841.74 --> 846.56]  And for something like, something complex like Windows, it doesn't work that way.
[846.68 --> 852.62]  So you can end up with a significant backlog in anything that's going on in the background if you interrupt it.
[852.94 --> 859.74]  That's exactly, so that's why anything that, you know, normal people interact with just can't work that way because it's so disruptive.
[860.24 --> 861.60]  It's a bad, bad analogy.
[861.84 --> 862.40]  Terrible analogy.
[862.60 --> 863.42]  I actually don't care.
[863.50 --> 865.26]  The point is, getting interrupted sucks.
[865.58 --> 865.74]  Yeah.
[866.44 --> 869.60]  I feel like you just are really into real-time operating systems right now.
[869.60 --> 871.22]  Yeah, how far off was I?
[871.56 --> 873.70]  I mean, oh, on that?
[873.78 --> 873.86]  Yeah.
[873.98 --> 874.54]  No, that was fine.
[874.56 --> 875.30]  Oh, the analogy was fine?
[875.42 --> 875.60]  Yeah.
[875.64 --> 875.94]  Okay, good.
[876.02 --> 879.10]  I just felt like I went too far into it.
[879.22 --> 881.40]  I feel like you kind of, like, made it work, but it worked.
[881.98 --> 882.22]  Thanks.
[882.22 --> 882.40]  You know?
[882.54 --> 882.72]  Yeah.
[882.84 --> 883.26]  Thanks, bro.
[883.36 --> 883.82]  Yeah, no worries.
[884.40 --> 886.80]  Speaking of making things work, you make that shirt work.
[887.32 --> 887.70]  Thank you.
[889.16 --> 891.06]  You can kind of see my nipples, which is a little weird.
[891.28 --> 891.48]  Yeah.
[891.54 --> 892.00]  But that's fine.
[892.42 --> 893.28]  They're not bad nipples.
[893.28 --> 895.14]  They're hiding behind the banner.
[895.14 --> 899.46]  Like, if they were kind of, you know, like, low nipples, then, like, yeah, I don't know, dog.
[901.26 --> 905.48]  Another thing that I noticed in here is it says that contract staff were paid overtime.
[905.60 --> 906.82]  It specifically says that.
[906.88 --> 907.00]  Right.
[907.12 --> 909.18]  So, I suspect salary staff were not paid overtime.
[909.48 --> 915.28]  That being said, I do suspect, in all fairness, that the salary staff are going to be getting wicked bonuses,
[915.70 --> 918.24]  especially with Fortnite ranking it in.
[918.34 --> 919.06]  I hope so.
[919.20 --> 919.84]  You might hope that.
[919.92 --> 921.04]  But that's not always a guarantee.
[921.04 --> 922.54]  So, Epic did make a statement.
[922.54 --> 926.04]  People are working very hard on Fortnite and other epic efforts.
[926.50 --> 930.14]  Extreme situations, such as 100-hour work weeks, are incredibly rare.
[930.68 --> 934.06]  And in those instances, we seek to immediately remedy them to avoid recurrence.
[934.58 --> 938.34]  But they are acknowledging that someone might work a 100-hour work week.
[938.82 --> 938.92]  Yeah.
[939.02 --> 942.32]  On what planet does that make any sense?
[942.42 --> 946.50]  Even at your worst, I don't think, like, you would have been anywhere near that.
[946.84 --> 947.84]  I've been over that.
[948.22 --> 948.56]  When?
[948.56 --> 953.90]  Really, really early with the Titan launch and the Forum at the same time.
[954.24 --> 954.60]  Okay.
[954.76 --> 954.94]  Right.
[955.08 --> 955.32]  Okay.
[955.56 --> 957.24]  So, okay.
[957.46 --> 958.88]  So, it happened once in the history of LJ.
[958.88 --> 960.26]  It's been very infrequent.
[962.34 --> 962.74]  Whatever.
[963.28 --> 965.08]  And that was, you also didn't tell me to.
[965.08 --> 968.82]  That was mostly me being like, I want to do these things.
[970.26 --> 971.20]  So, that was fine.
[971.46 --> 972.94]  I'm not complaining, to be clear.
[973.10 --> 975.66]  I didn't know that you worked that many hours that week anyway.
[976.20 --> 977.46]  So, here's the thing.
[979.34 --> 980.36]  Salaried positions.
[980.36 --> 981.36]  Salaried positions.
[981.36 --> 985.72]  And actually, just so you guys know, we work salary here at Linus Media Group.
[986.20 --> 994.22]  So, salary positions do come with the expectation that from time to time, you're getting it done.
[994.22 --> 1008.34]  With that said, the flip side, the employer's side of that sort of arrangement is for the people that put in those hours, for the people that are the star pupils in the class.
[1009.52 --> 1012.14]  Hey, there's some kind of a reward for that.
[1012.44 --> 1014.88]  It should flex back or there should be a bonus.
[1014.90 --> 1015.20]  Exactly.
[1015.20 --> 1015.88]  There should be something.
[1016.06 --> 1018.88]  That time should be recognized and compensated.
[1019.04 --> 1023.32]  Everything should be recognized and dealt with accordingly.
[1023.32 --> 1029.96]  Now, the other thing that is just kind of a, you know, usually you won't find an employment contract or anything.
[1029.96 --> 1037.90]  But the other thing that we see as part of the responsibility of both the employee and the employer is making sure that everyone's being reasonable.
[1039.34 --> 1040.90]  And communicating about stuff.
[1041.30 --> 1044.46]  So, we'll see people working too many hours sometimes.
[1044.58 --> 1048.44]  And we'll say, hey, good job, gold star.
[1048.82 --> 1050.20]  Appreciate the effort, obviously.
[1050.28 --> 1052.06]  I'm not going to tell you off for it.
[1052.50 --> 1053.02]  Thanks.
[1053.32 --> 1057.98]  But, like, hey, maybe you should go home.
[1059.46 --> 1061.38]  And spend some time there.
[1062.86 --> 1063.22]  You know?
[1063.94 --> 1064.86]  Especially for it.
[1064.96 --> 1066.32]  So, one thing I'll throw in.
[1066.40 --> 1070.12]  I've been doing a lot of interviews lately and people have been asking me about the work culture that we have.
[1070.18 --> 1072.20]  Because that's a big problem in the software development industry.
[1072.34 --> 1072.52]  Right.
[1072.68 --> 1074.66]  As we're talking about literally right now.
[1075.26 --> 1078.00]  But we just got turned off.
[1078.82 --> 1080.56]  Hey, it looks like kind of cool.
[1080.56 --> 1081.48]  It's kind of dramatic.
[1081.48 --> 1081.80]  Yeah.
[1082.02 --> 1083.10]  I'll go turn that back on.
[1084.04 --> 1087.90]  It is very few people have left Linus Media Group.
[1087.90 --> 1088.94]  Do you want to stick with it?
[1089.04 --> 1090.58]  I feel like we're, like, being interviewed.
[1090.76 --> 1091.32]  I'm cool with it.
[1091.74 --> 1093.40]  This feels like 60 minutes or something.
[1094.08 --> 1095.26]  I'm down.
[1095.42 --> 1095.94]  I'm into it.
[1096.02 --> 1096.48]  Let's do it.
[1096.62 --> 1096.84]  Sweet.
[1096.84 --> 1098.18]  But, yeah.
[1098.26 --> 1099.64]  Like, very few people have left.
[1099.70 --> 1103.18]  And I think that's a culture that Linus Media Group and Flowplane both want to continue.
[1104.14 --> 1107.10]  And in doing that, you don't really want to abuse your people all the time.
[1107.36 --> 1109.46]  Flowplane's had some pretty brutal crunches.
[1109.46 --> 1113.06]  I like to think that they weren't super long.
[1114.42 --> 1117.08]  But there have been some pretty brutal crunches.
[1117.16 --> 1121.88]  There's, like, sort of one going on right now with especially one specific guy on the team.
[1122.02 --> 1123.50]  But his thing is almost done.
[1123.72 --> 1124.76]  And he's pushing through.
[1125.34 --> 1126.06]  It's going to be good.
[1126.80 --> 1127.02]  Yeah.
[1127.02 --> 1129.62]  You guys are still in, like, very much startup mode.
[1129.96 --> 1134.84]  I mean, the thing is, like, it's, yeah, it's complicated.
[1134.84 --> 1139.64]  Because on the one hand, you know, the people work really hard.
[1140.08 --> 1141.46]  And that's, like, amazing.
[1142.14 --> 1147.80]  But on the other hand, we are, like, Yvonne was telling me the numbers for how far underwater we are on the project.
[1148.58 --> 1148.90]  Yeah.
[1149.16 --> 1150.34]  And I was like, oh, cool.
[1151.10 --> 1155.92]  The good news, though, and this is really exciting, is, sorry, dang it, we're doing floatplane news again.
[1156.04 --> 1156.34]  I swear.
[1156.34 --> 1158.12]  We'll do a real tech topic after this.
[1158.34 --> 1158.40]  Yeah.
[1158.54 --> 1163.28]  The good news, though, is that you guys are how close to launching the new Transcode engine?
[1163.38 --> 1164.12]  Very close.
[1164.34 --> 1168.96]  It's been, like, supposed to be out this week, sort of maybe every week for the last while.
[1169.10 --> 1173.06]  But there's been very legitimate reasons that it's been delayed.
[1173.16 --> 1176.20]  And we're trying to release something that's good and stable and stuff.
[1176.30 --> 1179.74]  Right now, it's, like, the majority of it's in prod, just not activated.
[1180.24 --> 1181.00]  And there's just, like...
[1181.00 --> 1182.90]  In prod means it's on the production server.
[1183.04 --> 1183.82]  Like, it's live.
[1183.96 --> 1184.18]  Yeah.
[1184.28 --> 1184.62]  Sort of.
[1184.72 --> 1185.98]  It's just not being used.
[1185.98 --> 1187.52]  It's there, though, and it's ready.
[1187.68 --> 1187.98]  And it didn't...
[1188.56 --> 1190.90]  I mean, it hasn't really been turned on, but it didn't break anything, which is great.
[1191.54 --> 1194.22]  And we're, like, extremely close to putting it live.
[1194.30 --> 1194.86]  It just...
[1194.86 --> 1196.68]  The confidence level wasn't quite there.
[1196.96 --> 1199.56]  And there's a few little problems still to be cleaned up.
[1199.76 --> 1201.00]  So, yeah.
[1201.00 --> 1208.22]  I'm getting to the point where I'm, like, thinking of reaching out to a few people specifically and being, like, hey, you might want to get ready.
[1209.16 --> 1209.50]  Nice.
[1209.50 --> 1210.44]  Because we're kind of there.
[1211.40 --> 1211.54]  Yeah.
[1211.62 --> 1218.76]  And the good news is once we start bringing creators on, the situation should change very, very, very quickly.
[1219.00 --> 1220.64]  Hopefully we won't just be hemorrhaging money all the time.
[1220.64 --> 1220.74]  Yeah.
[1220.84 --> 1221.66]  We've seen...
[1221.66 --> 1223.04]  I mean, I wouldn't call it hemorrhaging.
[1223.24 --> 1225.52]  The project has been running for two years.
[1225.80 --> 1226.02]  Yeah.
[1226.02 --> 1231.66]  And, like, the bleed rate keeps going up, you know.
[1232.02 --> 1233.94]  Which is kind of not the direction you want that to go in.
[1234.08 --> 1234.44]  But...
[1234.44 --> 1235.52]  It's sort of...
[1235.52 --> 1235.78]  It's fine.
[1235.78 --> 1238.34]  I keep hiring people, though, which is, like, the problem.
[1238.58 --> 1241.78]  But the team's in a really good spot right now.
[1241.98 --> 1244.18]  I'm really happy with everyone that's on the team.
[1244.34 --> 1246.74]  And I think we're doing great things currently.
[1246.74 --> 1253.90]  And if I didn't do that and we didn't hire more people and start losing more money, I think the project would be in a way worse spot.
[1253.90 --> 1256.50]  And we'd have, like, a never-launched kind of issue.
[1256.68 --> 1260.82]  We should talk more about, like, some of the milestones that we've hit in the last little bit.
[1260.92 --> 1263.68]  Like, during the roast.
[1264.28 --> 1267.44]  Anyway, but first, we're going to do some more news topics because we owe you guys that.
[1268.16 --> 1270.52]  So, here's an interesting one.
[1270.66 --> 1273.06]  Fang XP posted this on the forum.
[1273.06 --> 1279.28]  And it's based on a John Petty Research TV gaming market study.
[1279.28 --> 1286.72]  So, according to their latest report, more and more PC gamers will probably shift to consoles for a couple of reasons.
[1287.24 --> 1290.98]  One, increasing GPU or graphics card prices.
[1291.54 --> 1304.72]  Two, the inclusion of PC-specific features like 4K and ray tracing in next-gen consoles, including keyboard and mouse support, variable refresh rate, and high refresh rate using HDMI 2.1.
[1304.72 --> 1310.84]  One, streaming services like Google Stadia and the new all-digital Xbox One S.
[1311.38 --> 1315.16]  They're saying the coming of 5G will only bolster this new segment.
[1315.32 --> 1319.08]  That I am sort of wondering what the hell they're talking about.
[1319.80 --> 1323.08]  And they're saying that the majority of this will come from the low end.
[1323.16 --> 1325.50]  So, under $1,000 full build cost.
[1325.50 --> 1332.82]  So, in my opinion, this is almost moot.
[1333.38 --> 1334.36]  I know there's a difference.
[1334.84 --> 1335.58]  But we're getting...
[1335.58 --> 1343.04]  The more we progress, the more they're just fairly cost-effective pre-built PCs that are limited to only doing certain things.
[1344.06 --> 1346.44]  And, like, literally everything that he just listed, like,
[1346.70 --> 1348.58]  Yeah, I can use a keyboard and mouse.
[1349.44 --> 1350.50]  Variable refresh rate.
[1350.64 --> 1352.10]  It's like, okay, it's a computer.
[1353.02 --> 1353.46]  Thank you.
[1353.46 --> 1358.76]  So, I guess what you're trying to say is at what point do we just call it PC gaming and stop pretending?
[1359.08 --> 1359.28]  Yeah.
[1359.70 --> 1360.16]  I see.
[1360.30 --> 1362.84]  Like, I'm actually going to try to defend that argument a little bit.
[1362.88 --> 1369.22]  Because I think it's more actually phones and laptops and stuff that are actually causing this change.
[1369.34 --> 1370.74]  PlayStation Game Store.
[1374.62 --> 1375.06]  What?
[1375.66 --> 1376.64]  Like, you got your Steam?
[1377.00 --> 1377.18]  Yeah.
[1377.28 --> 1377.64]  Your Uplay?
[1377.82 --> 1379.14]  Oh, just put it on PC?
[1379.14 --> 1379.44]  The PlayStation.
[1379.80 --> 1380.52]  That would be amazing.
[1380.52 --> 1381.52]  Why don't we just...
[1381.52 --> 1384.58]  That would be the only game store that I would happily invite.
[1385.48 --> 1387.64]  You know, like, every game store is like, ugh, another one?
[1387.76 --> 1393.56]  Like, why don't we just stop f***ing around and just call it what it is.
[1393.82 --> 1394.00]  Yeah.
[1394.12 --> 1394.94]  Call it a computer.
[1395.16 --> 1395.28]  Yeah.
[1395.32 --> 1396.76]  Give me a graphics options slider.
[1396.76 --> 1397.34]  Let's do it.
[1398.30 --> 1398.84]  Heck yeah.
[1398.84 --> 1401.08]  That would be super cool.
[1401.30 --> 1402.36]  I'd be totally into that.
[1402.40 --> 1405.98]  Remember forever ago when I had my, like, console drive idea?
[1407.92 --> 1408.98]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1409.00 --> 1412.68]  You were going to take, like, an old console and just, like, insert it into the front of the computer.
[1412.84 --> 1416.14]  And you wanted to, like, mod it so that it...
[1416.14 --> 1416.80]  It looked like...
[1416.80 --> 1421.34]  It looked like a NES, like, a NES classic or, like, NES mini or, like, some kind of thing into it.
[1421.66 --> 1425.36]  And then the controllers were going to be hooked up into, like, the thing in the back or something, right?
[1425.72 --> 1426.46]  Yeah, there was...
[1426.46 --> 1428.86]  I had that idea of just doing it myself actually.
[1429.04 --> 1433.44]  But the reason why I came up with that idea was because what I was, like, pitching, pseudo-pitching,
[1433.50 --> 1438.94]  was that I wanted them to make, like, basically super premium Blu-ray drives for PC
[1438.94 --> 1441.22]  that were just branded Xbox and PlayStation.
[1441.70 --> 1444.24]  That just ran the freaking games through your own computer.
[1444.24 --> 1445.84]  So it's just a DRM scheme.
[1446.02 --> 1446.34]  Yes.
[1446.44 --> 1447.06]  Hardware DRM.
[1447.06 --> 1447.40]  Whatever.
[1447.56 --> 1448.46]  You want to do your thing?
[1449.06 --> 1449.42]  Whatever.
[1449.68 --> 1451.24]  Look, I'll pay...
[1452.02 --> 1453.12]  I'm so...
[1453.12 --> 1454.78]  Have you ever pitched that on WAN Show before?
[1454.94 --> 1455.16]  Yes.
[1455.30 --> 1456.78]  But this was years ago.
[1456.86 --> 1457.64]  I didn't even...
[1457.64 --> 1459.42]  I didn't even remember that exact...
[1459.42 --> 1459.76]  That makes...
[1459.76 --> 1463.24]  This was either garage or, like, early old house.
[1463.38 --> 1465.64]  It still makes so much sense.
[1465.98 --> 1466.50]  Yeah.
[1466.86 --> 1467.24]  To just...
[1468.02 --> 1469.52]  Because compared to paying...
[1469.52 --> 1470.16]  Leverage of hardware.
[1470.22 --> 1471.64]  How much does a 1S cost, anyway?
[1471.64 --> 1474.48]  Like, I think a 1X is, like, 400 bucks or 500.
[1475.04 --> 1477.54]  I think a 1S is, like, 350, I want to say?
[1478.28 --> 1478.86]  Can't remember.
[1479.96 --> 1481.24]  300 bucks or a 1S.
[1481.32 --> 1482.62]  But 1S isn't even the newest one.
[1482.72 --> 1482.90]  Right.
[1483.04 --> 1483.28]  Okay.
[1483.36 --> 1484.54]  But, no, I just mean the basic one.
[1484.78 --> 1486.30]  So the 1S is the basic one.
[1486.30 --> 1486.36]  Yeah, yeah.
[1486.88 --> 1493.26]  So, would you pay 250 for a DRM drive that just slips in the front of your thing and then
[1493.26 --> 1493.84]  you can play...
[1493.84 --> 1498.36]  Mind you, Microsoft is moving towards making Xbox games cross-platform for the most part
[1498.36 --> 1498.60]  anyway.
[1498.82 --> 1501.62]  So, Microsoft is starting to sort of solve that.
[1501.62 --> 1503.18]  So, a PS4 drive.
[1503.96 --> 1504.72]  PS4 drive?
[1504.86 --> 1505.26]  Honestly.
[1505.26 --> 1505.66]  PS4 drive.
[1506.46 --> 1507.60]  I probably would.
[1507.70 --> 1510.26]  Because there's a huge amount of PS4 exclusives that are super cool.
[1510.36 --> 1513.48]  I borrowed the works PS4 for a very long time.
[1513.50 --> 1514.38]  I had it for over a year.
[1514.44 --> 1515.38]  I forgot we even had one.
[1515.38 --> 1522.34]  And I like own a decent number of PS4 games because there was a lot of really cool single
[1522.34 --> 1523.86]  player RPGs that came out on PS4.
[1524.16 --> 1525.26]  God of War was amazing.
[1526.54 --> 1526.94]  I don't remember.
[1527.04 --> 1528.20]  That might have been on both consoles.
[1528.42 --> 1529.92]  But there was also a bunch that were specifically PS4.
[1529.92 --> 1531.26]  I'm pretty sure that's PlayStation specific.
[1531.40 --> 1531.98]  I could be wrong.
[1531.98 --> 1532.36]  God of War?
[1532.46 --> 1533.58]  I think God of War might be both.
[1534.08 --> 1537.58]  But there was a number of PS4 only ones that were also super cool.
[1537.64 --> 1538.80]  Never played a God of War game.
[1539.72 --> 1540.46]  Would like to.
[1540.70 --> 1541.54]  Just play that one.
[1542.08 --> 1542.74]  Just the first one?
[1543.14 --> 1543.42]  No.
[1543.54 --> 1544.42]  That's not the...
[1544.42 --> 1544.70]  No.
[1545.38 --> 1545.88]  Which one?
[1545.88 --> 1546.60]  The like rebrand.
[1546.72 --> 1547.64]  It's just called God of War.
[1547.82 --> 1548.72]  But it's the newest one.
[1548.94 --> 1549.40]  Oh, okay.
[1549.54 --> 1550.50]  It's super, super good.
[1550.54 --> 1551.90]  Oh, like a reboot kind of thing?
[1552.12 --> 1552.68]  I think so.
[1552.86 --> 1553.44]  Like Tomb Raider.
[1553.84 --> 1556.26]  It's quite different than the old games as far as I know.
[1556.66 --> 1558.68]  I didn't play the God of War games all that much.
[1558.68 --> 1559.30]  Kenji the yoke is asking for the old ones.
[1559.30 --> 1562.46]  Kenji the yoke is asking for an update on the bottles.
[1562.46 --> 1572.28]  So if you ordered one in the first 500, then it's either shipped or shipping very soon.
[1572.42 --> 1575.50]  Because those ones were actually sitting in the warehouse ready to rock.
[1575.68 --> 1575.82]  Yeah.
[1575.82 --> 1579.16]  If you're one of the hundreds of other people who...
[1579.16 --> 1582.68]  Remember, guys, there is a message on there that says it's a pre-order.
[1583.40 --> 1585.80]  Those are on the boat now.
[1586.40 --> 1588.00]  Otherwise, we wouldn't have taken pre-orders.
[1588.08 --> 1591.40]  We wouldn't take pre-orders on anything that's not shipping now.
[1591.78 --> 1593.08]  So those are on the boat now.
[1593.16 --> 1594.44]  They should be here in about three weeks.
[1594.44 --> 1597.58]  If they are a little bit later, I apologize in advance.
[1598.34 --> 1599.06]  I'm sorry.
[1599.20 --> 1602.72]  We are actually really new to the whole physical merchandise thing.
[1602.86 --> 1603.68]  We're trying really hard.
[1603.78 --> 1605.66]  But there's a learning curve.
[1606.16 --> 1609.10]  Actually, did you know that Lloyd is in China right now?
[1609.50 --> 1609.70]  Yeah.
[1609.92 --> 1610.12]  Yeah.
[1610.18 --> 1615.30]  So he's running around at a bunch of major manufacturer fairs.
[1615.88 --> 1619.20]  And he sent me back pictures of some sandals.
[1619.20 --> 1625.02]  Obviously, we would customize them like balls out, customize them.
[1625.16 --> 1626.34]  I actually love a pair of those.
[1626.46 --> 1628.32]  But would you wear an LTG sandal?
[1628.32 --> 1628.66]  100%.
[1628.66 --> 1628.88]  Yeah.
[1629.06 --> 1631.34]  See, I was talking to my wife about it.
[1631.64 --> 1631.92]  Sorry.
[1632.06 --> 1632.82]  You know my wife.
[1632.90 --> 1633.70]  You guys all know her name.
[1633.84 --> 1637.06]  I always forget that she's hosted TechLink now.
[1637.06 --> 1637.78]  Yeah, I was going to say.
[1637.88 --> 1638.32]  Out there.
[1638.50 --> 1638.98]  It's pretty good.
[1639.14 --> 1640.24]  I was talking to Yvonne about it.
[1640.46 --> 1642.92]  And she was like, I don't know.
[1643.42 --> 1645.14]  And I'm like, what don't you know?
[1646.04 --> 1647.52]  An LTG sandal?
[1647.52 --> 1648.70]  Like a dad sandal?
[1648.88 --> 1649.10]  Yeah.
[1649.62 --> 1650.42]  Oh, man.
[1650.66 --> 1651.26]  That'd be awesome.
[1651.74 --> 1653.26]  And people are like, yes.
[1653.38 --> 1653.70]  Yes.
[1653.98 --> 1656.22]  Socks are going to happen.
[1657.18 --> 1657.66]  Oh, my God.
[1657.68 --> 1658.32]  There's got to be a combo pack.
[1658.32 --> 1658.64]  Wait, no.
[1658.64 --> 1659.44]  This is not shipped yet.
[1659.50 --> 1659.76]  Never mind.
[1659.80 --> 1660.76]  I'm not going to talk about this.
[1661.72 --> 1662.54]  There's got to be a combo.
[1662.62 --> 1663.44]  Also, I was wrong.
[1663.68 --> 1664.86]  God of War is only on PlayStation.
[1665.18 --> 1666.60]  So there's another example.
[1666.68 --> 1668.50]  I knew a gaming thing that Luke didn't.
[1669.10 --> 1670.32]  We've got to play Anno again.
[1670.64 --> 1671.16]  It was fun.
[1671.44 --> 1672.50]  So, yeah, fine.
[1672.52 --> 1673.20]  We'll talk about it later.
[1673.28 --> 1673.44]  Okay.
[1673.50 --> 1673.82]  You know what?
[1673.82 --> 1675.08]  Let's get the sponsors done.
[1675.36 --> 1676.42]  We'll do one more news topic.
[1676.76 --> 1678.36]  And then we can actually talk about stuff.
[1678.46 --> 1678.64]  Okay.
[1678.64 --> 1680.14]  So we need to talk about Anno.
[1680.20 --> 1683.80]  We need to talk about the streaming, the roast.
[1683.92 --> 1687.56]  We need to talk about what else was like stuff we actually wanted to talk about.
[1688.36 --> 1688.96]  I don't know.
[1688.96 --> 1690.64]  All right.
[1690.68 --> 1691.50]  We'll do one more topic.
[1691.56 --> 1692.04]  One more topic.
[1692.12 --> 1693.06]  And then we'll jump into the news.
[1693.18 --> 1697.64]  So Intel's 2021 roadmap apparently leaked.
[1697.80 --> 1699.70]  So this is over on hexis.net.
[1699.70 --> 1708.44]  And apparently, Tweakers.net claims that these roadmaps came from a Dell presentation earlier this year.
[1708.58 --> 1717.72]  So on mobile, we're going to be looking at Comet Lake H series offering up to eight and ten core processors on 14 nanometer.
[1717.72 --> 1718.72]  14.
[1718.72 --> 1718.76]  14.
[1718.76 --> 1719.26]  14.
[1719.26 --> 1719.76]  Ooh.
[1719.76 --> 1720.26]  14.
[1720.26 --> 1720.76]  14.
[1720.76 --> 1723.64]  10 core on mobile?
[1723.64 --> 1724.64]  What?
[1724.64 --> 1726.64]  The whole thing is really funky.
[1726.64 --> 1728.24]  Wait, Comet Lake H?
[1728.54 --> 1731.58]  Do they mean like the mobile H chips?
[1732.66 --> 1733.78]  Surely they couldn't.
[1734.46 --> 1735.66]  That doesn't make any sense.
[1735.82 --> 1738.38]  No, that's got to be consumer.
[1738.50 --> 1738.98]  Hold on a second.
[1739.04 --> 1739.74]  I got to bring this up.
[1739.74 --> 1740.14]  That can't be right.
[1740.14 --> 1741.30]  Jumping into the actual article.
[1741.88 --> 1742.72]  That cannot be right.
[1742.80 --> 1743.08]  Okay, here.
[1743.14 --> 1743.36]  Hold on.
[1743.54 --> 1745.58]  The picture's a little small.
[1746.08 --> 1747.12]  It's a little tiny.
[1747.34 --> 1748.26]  You might want to open it.
[1748.26 --> 1750.04]  It says click to zoom, but it doesn't work.
[1750.44 --> 1751.42]  Thanks, Hexus.
[1751.54 --> 1751.88]  You tried.
[1752.02 --> 1752.78]  Click image to zoom.
[1753.68 --> 1754.36]  All right.
[1754.60 --> 1755.82]  U series H.
[1757.42 --> 1758.58]  Holy balls.
[1758.58 --> 1762.28]  That does actually appear to be the plan.
[1764.74 --> 1765.22]  Yep.
[1765.42 --> 1768.50]  That's 45 watt to 65 watt BGA.
[1768.78 --> 1769.66]  That is a big problem.
[1769.66 --> 1772.80]  Holy balls.
[1773.04 --> 1775.80]  All they're going to be doing is tuning the turbo boost again.
[1776.84 --> 1779.66]  Apparently, we're getting a U series six core.
[1779.66 --> 1782.62]  That's 45 watt to 65 watt BGA.
[1782.62 --> 1783.80]  That is a big problem.
[1784.08 --> 1784.84]  Sometime in.
[1785.42 --> 1786.90]  Holy balls.
[1787.26 --> 1789.98]  All they're going to be doing is tuning the turbo boost again.
[1791.04 --> 1793.76]  Apparently, we're getting a U series six core.
[1793.76 --> 1796.70]  That's 45 watt to 65 watt BGA.
[1796.70 --> 1797.24]  Oops.
[1798.46 --> 1799.02]  Sorry.
[1799.66 --> 1802.04]  Sorry, guys.
[1802.18 --> 1803.06]  Thanks for playing chat.
[1803.14 --> 1803.88]  My bad.
[1804.62 --> 1805.00]  Um.
[1805.54 --> 1806.08]  Oh, no.
[1806.16 --> 1806.42]  Wow.
[1806.62 --> 1808.76]  That seems like a terrible plan.
[1809.26 --> 1809.70]  Yeah.
[1809.94 --> 1810.38]  Especially.
[1810.62 --> 1811.50]  Have you seen some of.
[1811.50 --> 1813.02]  Well, they're just kind of screwed right now.
[1813.02 --> 1815.04]  Have you seen some of AMD's mobile stuff lately?
[1815.24 --> 1815.54]  Mm-hmm.
[1815.54 --> 1820.42]  They actually have some legitimate looking mobile devices coming down the pipe.
[1820.70 --> 1829.00]  Like we've got one from Lenovo on the shelf over there for a review that we're like, oh, this is like a sexy AMD laptop.
[1829.00 --> 1829.50]  Ah.
[1829.76 --> 1830.14]  What?
[1830.20 --> 1830.30]  What?
[1831.30 --> 1832.68]  Onlyว do d dipping?
[1832.68 --> 1838.82]  Because like the thing is a long time and never mind long time never
[1839.98 --> 1842.96]  When did AMD make any sense in mobile? Terry on?
[1844.36 --> 1846.36]  You're kidding me
[1846.92 --> 1848.92]  But it's still gonna drive me nuts. I
[1850.60 --> 1852.30]  It's been an extremely long time
[1852.30 --> 1857.54]  I remember like even when I used to work at Best Buy way way way way back
[1858.10 --> 1861.28]  The AMD options were the cheap crappy ones in terms of laptop
[1862.14 --> 1868.80]  At that time desktop they're actually pretty decent, but yeah, oh, sorry people are people are upset about what we were saying
[1868.80 --> 1872.72]  When we were looking at the road map basically 10 core 14 nanometer
[1872.72 --> 1878.64]  It's nuts because there's there's no power savings or like a nominal one. So all they're doing is just
[1879.76 --> 1885.84]  Stuffing more power hungry cores into this thing. So all they're doing is playing around with the turbo boosts and
[1885.84 --> 1887.60]  And
[1887.60 --> 1891.44]  Hoping that the notebook manufacturers can figure out how to cool the bloody things
[1891.44 --> 1895.20]  I could be wrong and someone at Intel might be able to explain their way through this
[1895.20 --> 1901.60]  But it feels like they're trying to throw some interesting numbers out there to keep people buying things
[1901.76 --> 1905.20]  While they try to figure out their manufacturing process problems
[1905.20 --> 1910.56]  It seems that way but like apparently they just don't think they're gonna have it figured out like yeah
[1910.56 --> 1915.60]  They've got for a while like they've got 10 nanometer stuff coming, but only u-series
[1915.68 --> 1919.36]  So h-series is not getting any 10 nanometer until
[1920.48 --> 1922.48]  At least 2021
[1922.80 --> 1930.80]  That's nuts. That's wild. Um, huh, that's funny. Uh, who's this uh, Frodo nubbets on the on float plane says you guys should make a holy balls shirt
[1931.44 --> 1934.64]  We did a long time ago actually and there's a cat on it. Uh, yeah
[1934.64 --> 1943.20]  Probably won't happen again. Uh, didn't sell very well. No, but uh, I don't think very many people would actually like wear that
[1943.20 --> 1946.64]  That's what happens when your catchphrase kind of sucks speaking of actually wear
[1948.00 --> 1950.00]  Speaking of actually wear that
[1950.00 --> 1956.96]  Do you guys like having this whole thing or would you prefer I got a mirror up here just this logo, but like over here?
[1958.00 --> 1961.20]  Uh, okay, so for context, um
[1961.20 --> 1966.56]  Um, we've discussed it internally. This was the plan. This was the design we all agreed on yeah
[1966.64 --> 1970.32]  And then we got it and we were like it looks very internet startup. It
[1970.96 --> 1974.64]  Really does it straight out of silicon valley. Yep. I
[1975.28 --> 1979.52]  Wow people are saying they love it, but remember this is like that's full chat chat
[1979.84 --> 1987.36]  Maybe we should probably talk to youtube chat. We need an objective uh analysis of the design here
[1988.00 --> 1992.56]  Uh, wow youtube chat moves so fast. I should we do a straw pool see it
[1993.28 --> 1996.96]  Yeah, you know what why don't you prepare a straw pool while I uh, while I jump what do you think for options?
[1996.96 --> 2003.68]  Just the logo in the corner and how it is now those two options. Yeah, sure. Okay. All right. Yeah, let's just do two options
[2004.24 --> 2011.44]  Uh, so today's video is brought to you by moss backpacks. Oh, hey, where's my backpack? Hey, look at that
[2011.44 --> 2013.44]  I don't even have to use the sponsor one
[2018.88 --> 2024.72]  Here's my backpack. I like it. I use it all the time. I that's a pretty good I could afford a different backpack
[2024.72 --> 2027.92]  But I don't because I really like this one and this is the old one
[2028.32 --> 2035.36]  It doesn't have all the features of the new one, but um, I like this one better. Actually. I don't I just like the color because
[2036.00 --> 2038.00]  um
[2038.00 --> 2043.36]  The samples they send to the new ones are black. So yeah, so this is the new one. It's black. It's all stealthy. It's the black pack
[2047.04 --> 2049.04]  It's the black pack
[2049.92 --> 2051.92]  Black pack
[2052.24 --> 2057.12]  It's such a wacky name. Yeah backpack. I don't see where they were going with that. It's like backpack
[2057.84 --> 2060.00]  Is it like do you think they intended it to be a pun?
[2060.72 --> 2062.32]  Oh, maybe
[2062.32 --> 2067.44]  Because it's a backpack that's black whoa crazy. Yeah, anyway, they also have
[2068.64 --> 2072.24]  The grande version of it that fits up to a 17 inch laptop
[2072.24 --> 2077.84]  They're made out of 300d nylon for the exterior and 1000d nylon for the interior for water resistance and
[2078.72 --> 2084.72]  The black pack fits backpack laptops up to 15.6 inches. They're made a that one's made of ballistic nylon
[2085.28 --> 2087.44]  That gives it abrasion and tear resistance
[2088.24 --> 2092.16]  Um, it's got a built-in rain fly to provide extra padding for your electronics when not in use
[2092.64 --> 2096.40]  Um, that doesn't make any sense, but whatever it's good. I like it
[2096.40 --> 2101.52]  Both of them come with mounting for the water resistance reach c reach plus power adapters and a five-year warranty
[2101.52 --> 2105.68]  You can get 20 off their current stock until it's gone limited quantities at the link
[2106.48 --> 2112.72]  Right there boom. I'm pretty sure the rain thing is because I used to have one is a cover that you take out and put over your bag
[2112.72 --> 2118.48]  But that doesn't provide extra padding that might be a separate talking point that oh the pat
[2118.48 --> 2120.88]  Oh, I bet you what that is is when you put it back
[2122.32 --> 2126.16]  If it's not raining and it's in the bag it probably provides padding got it
[2126.24 --> 2130.40]  Just don't get used to just throwing your bag down. Yeah when it's in there
[2130.96 --> 2137.92]  And then and then it'd be a rainy day you put it on you talk about it's bad bad comb. Just don't do that. Yeah, also brought to you by madrina
[2138.72 --> 2142.40]  Madrina's coffee is coffee for fuel organic cold brew coffee
[2143.12 --> 2145.12]  yep
[2145.76 --> 2149.28]  In a convenient 15 ounce grab-and-go can with a flavor for everyone
[2149.52 --> 2154.72]  They offer sweet and creamy flavors like their mocha or caramel or bold flavors like their cold brew black
[2155.04 --> 2158.56]  We actually have a permanent item on their store the lambo roast
[2158.56 --> 2159.68]  Which you can smell it smells good
[2159.68 --> 2161.44]  Go and check it out it actually does smell really good
[2161.44 --> 2166.80]  I head over to madrina's coffee calm slash linus to get 50% off your entire order with code linus
[2167.04 --> 2171.92]  The first 25 people who use code linus will get a free madrina's coffee micro roast
[2172.24 --> 2176.56]  Fun if you have any questions about the various flavors of cold brew or micro roast
[2176.80 --> 2182.56]  Shlomo from madrina's coffee will be in the chat ready to answer your questions through direct messages
[2183.12 --> 2186.64]  Finally our last sponsor for the day is displate
[2186.64 --> 2187.44]  Where are they?
[2187.44 --> 2188.08]  They're back here
[2188.08 --> 2188.48]  There they are
[2188.48 --> 2189.04]  Oh cool
[2189.04 --> 2190.56]  Hey we have new designs to show off
[2190.56 --> 2194.08]  Displate is a magnetic mounted metal print company
[2194.08 --> 2196.40]  And these magnetic mounted metal prints are durable
[2196.40 --> 2198.32]  You don't need any power tools to hang them
[2198.32 --> 2199.68]  They've got over 26
[2199.68 --> 2200.40]  Excuse me
[2200.40 --> 2204.88]  260,000 different arts spanning a bunch of different styles and influences
[2204.88 --> 2209.28]  And with their easy magnetic mounting there are no holes in the wall and they're easily replaceable
[2209.28 --> 2211.76]  They plant 10 trees for every displate purchased
[2211.76 --> 2216.16]  And you can head to our link below and use offer code LTT to save 15%
[2216.16 --> 2219.36]  That's lmd.gg slash displate when really luke
[2221.44 --> 2223.04]  You're gonna be like that
[2223.60 --> 2224.32]  Alrighty then
[2225.76 --> 2226.24]  All right
[2227.44 --> 2230.64]  So do we have any other news topics that we have to uh that we have to do?
[2230.64 --> 2231.44]  I don't think so
[2231.44 --> 2233.84]  Oh, this is pretty cool vega finally beats rtx
[2234.48 --> 2235.68]  Vulcan strikes again
[2235.68 --> 2242.40]  Uh, so this was posted by bluej614 on the forum the original source is wccf tech
[2243.60 --> 2251.36]  AMD's rx vega64 apparently outperforms the rtx 2080 by up to 20% in the vulcan enabled game world war z
[2251.36 --> 2256.24]  The benchmarks were conducted with an overclocked core i9 9900k at 5.2 gigahertz
[2256.56 --> 2258.72]  This is to eliminate any possible bottlenecking
[2258.72 --> 2265.36]  It drives me freaking crazy when people in the comments flip out about you guys are using overclocked cpu
[2265.36 --> 2267.12]  Your results aren't realistic
[2267.12 --> 2272.48]  Okay, the reason is that you're trying to alleviate bottlenecks elsewhere in the system
[2272.48 --> 2279.28]  So you can see the maximum potential difference in performance between the components you're actually trying to test anyway
[2280.08 --> 2287.20]  At 1920 by 1080 with vulcan enabled amd managed to take all three top spots with its radeon 7 vega64 liquid cooled and vega64
[2288.40 --> 2292.56]  And the vega64 outpaced the rtx 2080 ti despite costing half as much
[2292.56 --> 2299.20]  NVIDIA closed the gap at 1440p at 4k there still isn't my blah blah blah blah blah blah basically it's one game
[2299.20 --> 2299.60]  um
[2300.72 --> 2308.16]  If we were to take like intel's performance in counter-strike source as like an overall indication of intel's
[2308.80 --> 2310.80]  dominance in
[2311.20 --> 2313.20]  Gaming performance, um
[2314.00 --> 2316.00]  We would be silly because skewed. Yeah
[2316.00 --> 2321.92]  If we're like aggressively skewed you know what intel outperforms amd by like 30 40 percent
[2322.88 --> 2325.76]  It doesn't actually yes and cs source. Yes, but um
[2327.44 --> 2328.32]  Go
[2328.32 --> 2333.36]  Yeah, it may or may not be specifically the vulcan-ness of it. Um
[2334.24 --> 2338.32]  I mean, it's an it's a neat headline, but I probably wouldn't read too much into it
[2338.32 --> 2340.96]  If you if you have seen that headline until we start seeing
[2341.76 --> 2343.12]  vulcan
[2343.12 --> 2347.76]  Across a broad sampling of games, uh giving amd that kind of a performance advantage
[2348.40 --> 2348.80]  um
[2350.16 --> 2351.76]  Yeah, I probably wouldn't read too much into it
[2353.04 --> 2354.16]  LTX
[2354.16 --> 2355.68]  Yeah, what about it?
[2355.68 --> 2358.80]  Uh, there's less than 40 byoc tickets left
[2358.80 --> 2364.24]  So if you want to bring your own computer and show up at the event and have a land center thing and all that kind of fun stuff
[2364.48 --> 2366.80]  Get a freaking ticket because you're running out of time
[2367.36 --> 2370.56]  Also volunteers they want people to apply to volunteer
[2370.56 --> 2374.24]  I believe that's in the description down below if you want to check that out if you're not on twitch
[2375.52 --> 2382.32]  And they will be getting back to current applicants in may if you're wondering why you haven't received a a response yet
[2383.84 --> 2387.44]  And also if you bought a ticket and want to volunteer they'll refund your ticket
[2388.16 --> 2390.08]  Oh, really cool apparently
[2390.08 --> 2396.08]  So the way we're structuring things is that either an lmg member or brand partner will be managing the overall operation of a booth
[2396.08 --> 2398.88]  And then volunteers will help as needed to make the area a success
[2398.88 --> 2403.20]  So we're looking for between 60 to 80 talented volunteers in total. We've already got 20
[2403.84 --> 2409.36]  Shifts will be either one eight-hour day and then with one day to enjoy the show or a four-hour shift each day
[2409.36 --> 2412.08]  And then time to take part in the expo for the other half of the day
[2412.48 --> 2419.92]  Duties will include scanning tickets handing swag out recording entries answering questions directing people building pcs disassembling pcs running around watching stuff and
[2419.92 --> 2426.88]  More i'm sure all volunteers will receive free admission as described byoc not included the ltx merch pack
[2427.20 --> 2433.68]  Shirt pen lanyard meals during your shift reference letter from us for your help and of course our undying gratitude gratitude never dies
[2434.32 --> 2436.32]  Just becomes undead
[2436.72 --> 2440.24]  Apologies to the volunteer applicants that jono and colton interviewed a few weeks ago
[2440.24 --> 2443.20]  We will update you guys in may once we have a firmer grasp on schedule
[2443.20 --> 2446.24]  How many people we need for each booth there we go?
[2446.80 --> 2450.00]  Um, yeah, man, it's happening soon. Yeah
[2450.64 --> 2452.24]  and my
[2452.24 --> 2460.32]  Our team is coming out. We've got a lot to hang out. I'm so excited. I am so stoked especially because some of the special projects that
[2460.80 --> 2463.28]  Ltt has been working on in order to
[2463.84 --> 2466.96]  Have them there at ltx are starting to come together. So
[2466.96 --> 2470.64]  Oh, you tried you tried one today
[2471.44 --> 2473.52]  That I hoped was gonna be
[2474.40 --> 2481.68]  Pretty cool like like 25 is cool. I would have hoped it would have been 25 is cool. Um, so basically, uh, jake
[2482.56 --> 2485.60]  mostly jake has been working on a first person view
[2486.32 --> 2487.04]  um
[2487.04 --> 2489.76]  The idea was okay. So it came it came from
[2490.72 --> 2496.72]  Racing games are fun and a couple of the really amazing experiences that we've had at ltx in previous years
[2496.96 --> 2503.28]  Where we we lugged 16k gaming to the first one and then when we did the ultra wide version the 10k gaming
[2503.76 --> 2504.56]  um
[2504.56 --> 2508.00]  One we we brought that one as well and we we hooked up racing games, which
[2509.20 --> 2514.72]  Was pretty sweet. It was really cool ultra wide one with the racing wheel and the like big screen experience
[2515.36 --> 2518.00]  Unlike anything most people will ever experience
[2518.56 --> 2519.44]  um
[2519.44 --> 2521.44]  But the bezels
[2521.52 --> 2524.96]  The bezels and it's all virtual. It's just video games
[2524.96 --> 2526.16]  So
[2527.52 --> 2531.60]  Next level stuff happening at ltx 2019 and this video is going to be freaking sick
[2532.08 --> 2532.56]  um
[2533.12 --> 2536.80]  We are we were using first person view racing goggles
[2537.76 --> 2542.80]  Okay, so these are for drones typically but people have been known to hook them up to rc cars
[2543.36 --> 2543.76]  and
[2543.76 --> 2548.00]  rc cars and we want to build well not want to
[2548.96 --> 2549.60]  did build
[2550.96 --> 2552.88]  the the like irl
[2553.84 --> 2557.28]  Racing game experience. It's so cool. Oh my goodness
[2557.84 --> 2562.72]  And it's like I don't even know why it's so different
[2563.28 --> 2564.88]  from just playing a video game
[2564.88 --> 2569.28]  But it's very notably different. We we both expressed similar things about how just
[2569.28 --> 2576.16]  Just the fact that it is actually real seems to impact you a lot more and the learning curve if you know how to drive
[2577.76 --> 2582.08]  Super fast zero you just you're just like oh i'm driving
[2583.12 --> 2584.32]  It's
[2584.32 --> 2588.72]  The latency is incredible so dji uh sent over their fpv racing goggles
[2589.12 --> 2590.08]  um
[2590.08 --> 2591.68]  just
[2591.68 --> 2594.96]  Just unbelievable so quite the experience so at ltx
[2594.96 --> 2598.80]  Uh, so the first part of the video is going to be like the proof of concept which we finished today
[2599.12 --> 2606.08]  The second part of the video is going to be um dialing it in getting four of them going. Yeah, uh building a track
[2606.08 --> 2612.56]  So it's going to be like a sick track. There's gotta be a jump. There's gotta be a jump. Oh my goodness
[2613.04 --> 2617.52]  If we don't have a jump then we failed. Yeah, we'll we'll we'll do our best to have a jump cool
[2617.76 --> 2623.52]  Um, so so we're gonna build a track and then we're going to do it as more like a step-by-step guide
[2624.00 --> 2624.56]  Okay
[2624.56 --> 2630.00]  So guys if you're into this sort of thing and you just have unlimited money lying around because you're dead mouse or something
[2630.40 --> 2631.76]  um
[2631.76 --> 2635.60]  Here's how you do it step by step to build your own fpv car
[2636.16 --> 2641.28]  Complete with racing wheel and pedals and brakes and all that kind of stuff. It's it's pretty it's pretty crazy
[2641.28 --> 2647.36]  One of the craziest things for me is I in vr games. I don't get the effect like if you play a roller coaster game
[2647.36 --> 2650.88]  I don't get the like whoa. I should be feeling jeez as I go around this corner
[2651.36 --> 2658.88]  Um, but driving that little car you're like you feel like you have to lean really feels like you're trying to lean into the corners and like it
[2658.88 --> 2661.36]  It's oh man, and when realism is like
[2662.24 --> 2665.84]  Surprisingly very and when you're playing on a monitor you never feel like oh
[2666.48 --> 2672.40]  I just need to like peek around this corner. Yeah, but I was moving my head constantly even though there's no head tracking in this
[2673.04 --> 2677.04]  Yeah, oh man, that was wild super super cool super fun
[2677.68 --> 2679.84]  Um, I was not expecting to do that today
[2681.20 --> 2683.20]  It's so much better than I expected
[2683.20 --> 2691.04]  Oh, well sweet. What else we got going I think we're out of topics. That's fine. I don't need any more topics who needs topics anyway, you know
[2691.76 --> 2694.32]  Yeah, I need to upgrade my freaking computer
[2695.36 --> 2696.96]  Yes, I was hoping you're gonna bring that up
[2697.84 --> 2698.96]  so
[2698.96 --> 2702.72]  Okay, I love I love the original anno game
[2703.52 --> 2706.32]  The computer for anno i'm sorry, it's just
[2706.32 --> 2714.32]  It's so laggy
[2714.32 --> 2716.32]  It's so bad
[2720.48 --> 2721.92]  I'm sorry you can go
[2721.92 --> 2727.20]  So I loved the original anno game over here in north america. It was called 1602 ad
[2727.52 --> 2734.56]  Um, and I played that a ton as a kid like was there a different release way too much and in europe. It was called anno
[2734.56 --> 2736.40]  Oh, okay. Yeah, it's a german game
[2737.12 --> 2741.44]  Actually, yeah, it was like one of the first german games to really break out on an international
[2741.92 --> 2745.28]  That makes sense because when I look up things for it. There's a lot of german forums
[2746.16 --> 2754.40]  Which I was kind of surprised by that's interesting like the amount it sold in germany compared to the population of germany
[2754.56 --> 2756.48]  relative to the rest of the world it's like
[2757.76 --> 2763.92]  So like basically everyone in germany played this and apparently it was close to 50 50 male and female. That's cool. Yeah
[2763.92 --> 2769.20]  Because the the the thing with anno is that it's low pressure gameplay
[2770.00 --> 2772.88]  Almost nothing is not reversible. Hmm
[2773.76 --> 2778.08]  So if you kind of go down the wrong path and you're not successful or whatever, those are crushed
[2779.12 --> 2780.72]  Oh, all right. It's not like that
[2781.28 --> 2786.64]  Um, so anyway, I picked up the new anno game because luke was over and he's like, oh, yeah, I got it donno got it colton got it
[2786.88 --> 2791.52]  And I was like, oh peer pressure. I guess I better get it's like 80 dollars canadian ridiculous anyway
[2792.08 --> 2797.20]  So I got it fired it up and uh on my you know super nice still monitor
[2797.68 --> 2800.88]  You know what apparently whoa yeah
[2801.76 --> 2804.16]  Look, oh what happened you can see it
[2805.04 --> 2807.04]  The obs capture is delayed
[2807.20 --> 2809.20]  Talk watch your mouth move hello
[2809.68 --> 2812.16]  That looked okay. What really? I don't know
[2813.20 --> 2815.20]  uh-oh
[2815.20 --> 2815.76]  uh
[2815.76 --> 2823.68]  Okay, are we is it bad apparently makes audio do you think I don't know necessarily how much oh, okay?
[2824.40 --> 2829.44]  It looks out of sync slightly to me. Okay. Yeah, I can't do anything about that right now
[2829.44 --> 2833.20]  We'll just go with it. I'm just gonna go like this. Okay, so now won't bother you guys. No one can tell
[2833.20 --> 2843.12]  So um, so anyway, um, so so yeah, so I got it and uh luke was over so he's never played a nano game before
[2843.12 --> 2847.44]  Yeah, but you had tooled around for like 20 minutes or something right played for less than an hour
[2847.84 --> 2849.92]  and uh, I had watched like
[2850.88 --> 2852.32]  part of a
[2852.32 --> 2854.16]  starting guide video
[2854.16 --> 2858.48]  Okay, got it. So uh, basically as someone who had actually played the game before
[2858.48 --> 2863.28]  Um, I was surprised at how applicable my knowledge was given that it's been like
[2864.16 --> 2866.88]  20 years since the first one or something stupid like that
[2867.12 --> 2870.96]  and I even one of the really interesting things to me was I watched you play
[2871.52 --> 2877.20]  The original one for a little while and even stuff like certain buildings. I was able to perfectly recognize
[2877.92 --> 2881.36]  Because they like I don't know. I've seen some reviews
[2882.08 --> 2883.12]  Obviously, I didn't play the other ones
[2883.12 --> 2886.48]  But I've seen a lot of reviews refer to it as like a return to form and all this kind of stuff
[2886.48 --> 2891.36]  And I think they really tried to go back to the roots of that exact game that you happen to be playing at that time
[2891.36 --> 2893.36]  Right, which is kind of hilarious
[2893.36 --> 2900.64]  But but yeah, it seemed to work out. Um, so anyway, I uh, so I fire it up on my still pretty nice monitor
[2900.64 --> 2903.76]  So 100 hertz 3440 by 1440 and i'm getting like
[2904.48 --> 2909.12]  I'm like luke, you know, it's it's weird because I find like the menus really laggy
[2909.84 --> 2915.12]  So i've got g-sync which means that it's a little harder to pick up on like frame rate fluctuations
[2916.48 --> 2923.44]  But I was probably running at like 45 fps or or less. It probably just or less probably dipped below that i'm
[2925.28 --> 2929.12]  I think it was below that on average. I think it dipped below 30
[2930.40 --> 2936.72]  Probably I think so that was it was pretty bad and there was certain like there were yeah, there were certain interactions that were
[2937.60 --> 2940.96]  Specifically very difficult because of the frame rate, which is wild
[2940.96 --> 2948.08]  It was kind of helpful to watch so um, so so so he's like, yo, what kind of hardware you're running in here? I'm like that titan
[2949.36 --> 2949.76]  x
[2950.64 --> 2952.64]  maxwell
[2953.84 --> 2960.32]  So something a lot of people might not realize is that I had and you were running at ultra wide and
[2961.52 --> 2963.20]  Great settings and all that kind of stuff. Yeah
[2963.20 --> 2964.72]  Yeah, so I was running it like ultra well
[2964.72 --> 2968.72]  I tuned it down a fair bit when we played multiplayer the next day and it was yeah
[2968.72 --> 2974.32]  It was it was like 40 but not like 45. Okay. Um, all right. Oh, I just broke this
[2974.88 --> 2978.32]  Dang it. Why do I fidget with pen things? This is a stylus. Oops
[2979.04 --> 2981.04]  Dang it
[2981.04 --> 2982.24]  Anyway, um
[2982.24 --> 2986.80]  So yeah, a lot of people might not realize this but in the last seven years
[2986.80 --> 2991.20]  I have either had an infant or a young
[2992.08 --> 2998.64]  Like company to deal with and I haven't had a lot of time to play games. Anno in particular is a
[2999.36 --> 3002.08]  Massive it's it's a black hole that consumes
[3002.80 --> 3007.92]  Time itself. Um, I think I think it's even though it's real time. I think it might rival civ
[3009.36 --> 3012.72]  Yeah, like it's pretty crazy, especially if you kind of take your time with things
[3012.72 --> 3018.96]  Yeah, and in multiplayer, I couldn't find anyway a way to change the game speed
[3019.52 --> 3024.40]  So we were playing at 1x game speed, which I the income felt pretty slow
[3025.04 --> 3030.08]  Yeah, well I you also just like weren't as good at it as me. Wow. There's that wow
[3031.20 --> 3036.56]  Wasn't I further ahead whose islands better wasn't I further ahead further ahead of what I had money population?
[3037.12 --> 3039.12]  Yeah tech I had money
[3039.36 --> 3041.36]  Okay, yeah
[3041.36 --> 3045.68]  Game to get a certain amount of citizens. I was actually I was actually being nice to you
[3045.68 --> 3048.24]  I had the artisan class like five minutes before you said anything
[3048.96 --> 3052.64]  Sorry, sorry five minutes in the grand scheme of that whole night was not very much
[3053.12 --> 3055.12]  And I probably got more of them when I got them
[3055.44 --> 3060.32]  Yeah, but you probably also ran into a bunch of trouble where you didn't have any workers for your friggin factories
[3060.88 --> 3062.96]  That's fair. That did happen. Yeah, that did happen didn't it?
[3063.04 --> 3065.04]  I didn't know they needed 200 people so
[3065.92 --> 3070.96]  Money who was always buying stuff from your warehouse which I realized so that you know that I might further
[3070.96 --> 3073.12]  Was a terrible idea I should just built with it
[3076.16 --> 3078.24]  So that does not make it better
[3078.56 --> 3084.96]  That does not make it better at all. I should have kept all of that. I have now learned that was not a favor in the slightest
[3085.60 --> 3087.28]  Oh my goodness. Did you or did you not need the money?
[3087.28 --> 3092.32]  I did it's not my fault that I should have just I should have just built worker houses
[3093.28 --> 3096.72]  To solve the problem and like a recurring basis
[3097.92 --> 3099.20]  Whatever man
[3099.20 --> 3100.08]  It was fun though
[3100.08 --> 3104.24]  And then I thought my bill uh my apartment building lit on fire and then I had to run away
[3104.56 --> 3106.72]  Space monkey says linus good at a game. What?
[3106.72 --> 3108.72]  You know
[3108.72 --> 3113.60]  You mostly you joke about it quite a bit. Yeah. Oh, actually I played apex on stream today
[3113.60 --> 3115.60]  The problem is that I watched a little bit of it
[3117.12 --> 3118.16]  The problem is that
[3119.60 --> 3122.96]  Newer game genres are a bit of a problem for me
[3123.84 --> 3126.80]  So if I am dropped into um
[3127.44 --> 3131.36]  A battle royale, I don't even think that's true. It depends
[3132.24 --> 3138.96]  So apex legends has a lot of gameplay elements or fortnight for example the whole building thing where I have to
[3140.00 --> 3142.40]  You know, I can't do the building thing at all. Yeah, i'm terrible
[3142.40 --> 3147.12]  Yeah, like I I have to completely learn like a new skill set
[3147.12 --> 3152.96]  In order to play this game to play that game because of the building and and my my my whole thing is like I don't mind
[3153.52 --> 3155.20]  Learning to play a new game
[3155.20 --> 3161.20]  But I don't really have the time to learn an entirely new genre because by the time I sit down and
[3161.20 --> 3163.20]  Sort of fumble my way through it
[3163.20 --> 3167.04]  Meanwhile all the kids that are spending 30 hours a week playing this game
[3167.68 --> 3174.32]  Know the entire map and every element of the gameplay like the back of their hands by the time I fumble my way through how to like
[3174.88 --> 3178.08]  Play it at all because I just don't have time to sit down and yeah
[3178.80 --> 3180.88]  It's like a kid's crying or
[3181.60 --> 3182.88]  or
[3182.88 --> 3187.92]  Something and I get interrupted and then and then I can't I can't get back to it
[3187.92 --> 3190.88]  I've got to do some some job interviews or something and then two weeks later
[3190.88 --> 3196.48]  I look at it again. I'm like, oh, I kind of forget exactly how to do this. So if you just drop me in a pure shooter
[3197.36 --> 3202.96]  Okay, like I won't know the maps and that sucks, but like I can get some kills and cook my eyes
[3203.20 --> 3206.24]  I can click heads. No problem if you drop me into something where
[3206.72 --> 3210.16]  Um, there's you know, very realistic recoil for example
[3211.12 --> 3213.12]  Yeah, I I do have trouble with that
[3213.12 --> 3216.16]  Um, but then a lot of it see the problem with a lot of that
[3216.16 --> 3223.20]  I think what it's coming down to is i'm not trying to toot your horn, but it's it's time investment with a specific mechanic
[3223.68 --> 3229.44]  Where like with recoil a lot of games that have heavy recoil you need to learn the recoil of that specific gun
[3229.60 --> 3236.48]  Yeah, so that just takes time like you you'll learn patterns of recoil stuff and all that just takes a huge amount of time
[3236.48 --> 3242.00]  Or even like research because you can just look like something like counter-strike you can just go find resources that'll tell you okay
[3242.48 --> 3244.56]  As soon as you start holding down on an ak
[3245.52 --> 3252.72]  Move down about this much like a seven. Yeah, you draw. Yeah, it's like in a certain speed. I'll say it's and like because pub g didn't
[3252.72 --> 3255.12]  We win our first two games that you ever played. Yeah
[3255.84 --> 3259.52]  Yeah, we won the very first one. I don't know if we won the second one too, but we won another one that night
[3259.52 --> 3263.36]  Yeah, and we only played three or four games and we wanted to carry pretty good
[3264.24 --> 3267.84]  I did do some damage though. You did some damage and in pub g in apex
[3267.84 --> 3270.96]  You can bring people back and all this kind of healing is a lot easier in pub g
[3270.96 --> 3276.00]  It's not and you were alive till the end and you were making calls and you were landing shots like it's
[3277.04 --> 3280.40]  It was the first freaking game you ever played and you were doing damage
[3280.64 --> 3287.44]  That's honestly I think you did better in those first one to four games than most people that I play with right are actively playing modern games
[3287.44 --> 3289.52]  It's just that you don't have a lot of time investment. Yeah, again
[3289.52 --> 3293.20]  I'm not trying to your horn. And so the thing is like if I have the prerequisite skills already
[3293.52 --> 3297.60]  Um, like pub g I found really a lot like playing paintball. Yeah, yeah
[3298.72 --> 3307.04]  Okay, so like the tactics were 100% there. Yeah, it's just that I don't have but like I need someone to like tell me what ammo goes and what gun
[3307.60 --> 3312.80]  Like I'm not I'm not an ammo head. I don't know like oh, yeah, like an mp
[3312.80 --> 3315.60]  Whatever. Yeah, I've got to get this caliber
[3316.32 --> 3320.96]  I didn't know what scopes fit on anything or whatever. So as long as people like tell me. Okay. Yeah pick that one up
[3321.28 --> 3325.20]  Like okay. Yep, sure. Uh, okay. How do I sorry? How do I mount the stock?
[3325.84 --> 3327.84]  How do I put this on like
[3327.84 --> 3332.32]  Okay, sure as long as I don't have to learn the gameplay mechanics then like honestly, it's not that bad
[3332.48 --> 3337.04]  Um, and rts games. I actually played a lot more than fps games when I was growing up
[3337.04 --> 3342.96]  I was like a warcraft 2 kid. I played way too much like you want to play warcraft 2 with me
[3342.96 --> 3346.88]  I will slay you probably I promise you I was too young
[3346.88 --> 3350.64]  I will slay you and your friend. I played warcraft 3 though. No problem. Let's do work
[3351.76 --> 3357.36]  So warcraft 3 is a funny one. I actually played it a fair bit uh, the summer that it came out in french
[3358.32 --> 3360.96]  Because I was on I was on an exchange
[3361.52 --> 3362.40]  um
[3362.40 --> 3366.40]  To quebec for like my thing and the the kid that I was staying with
[3367.04 --> 3374.08]  Um got it and warcraft 3 was a game that was way too demanding for my home pc to run at that point
[3375.44 --> 3377.44]  It's like it's a recurring theme
[3377.68 --> 3379.28]  fortunately, um
[3379.28 --> 3382.88]  So so what what I did was I so I played a fair bit of it in front so uh
[3383.52 --> 3385.52]  I'm gonna do some taminae, you know
[3386.72 --> 3390.72]  So I know all the like stupid I probably played it more in french than I did in english
[3390.72 --> 3393.20]  Um, so anyway, when I when I went home
[3393.20 --> 3397.36]  I spent all the money that I made that summer on building my very first gaming pc
[3397.36 --> 3399.76]  And I use the term gaming pc pretty loosely it had
[3400.40 --> 3404.64]  Geforce graphics. Yeah, geforce 4 mx 440. Yeah
[3405.36 --> 3407.36]  chipset graphics
[3409.12 --> 3411.28]  Um, but it was good enough to run warcraft 3
[3411.28 --> 3414.48]  So I actually bought myself a copy of that which was a lot of money for me at that time
[3414.48 --> 3415.92]  Yeah, 60 bucks a brand new game
[3416.32 --> 3419.84]  Um, and I played it like a fair bit. I played the cap, but I mostly played campaign
[3419.84 --> 3422.16]  I just I never really got into the competitive side
[3422.56 --> 3424.56]  um, but
[3424.96 --> 3429.12]  I'm gonna interject here for a second. Yeah, if you want to play some warcraft 3 again, i'll play some warcraft 3
[3429.12 --> 3432.64]  My brother and I decided to download it for fun. Yeah, there's still
[3433.44 --> 3435.44]  An active community. Oh, I'm sure there's an active
[3435.44 --> 3437.76]  A very active. Oh, blazer games never like we we
[3438.32 --> 3442.72]  My we downloaded some maps. There's I don't remember exactly what it's called. So sorry
[3442.72 --> 3444.72]  But there's a website that you can google very easily
[3444.72 --> 3447.84]  It's like frozen maps or something like that or war war maps
[3447.84 --> 3448.48]  I don't remember
[3448.48 --> 3453.20]  Uh, but you can download maps and you can host games and they will fill like immediately
[3453.60 --> 3457.20]  Like there's a very active player base that is ready to go into games
[3457.20 --> 3460.80]  The thing that is tough about games that have been around forever
[3461.36 --> 3463.20]  Is that masters? Yes
[3463.76 --> 3469.52]  Everyone's like really good. So I didn't play supreme commander for like four or five years or something stupid like that
[3469.52 --> 3474.56]  And then I tried to drop in on the fa forever community and I was like, yeah, I probably still know how to play this kid
[3474.96 --> 3476.00]  dead
[3476.00 --> 3481.92]  So key mechanics have changed a fair bit like I didn't like forged alliance. I really preferred vanilla supreme commander
[3482.48 --> 3488.00]  I didn't like how fast but commanders were all of a sudden instead of being like highly vulnerable. They were
[3488.96 --> 3493.60]  Like these speed demons and they were more like combat units instead of like
[3494.16 --> 3495.44]  um
[3495.44 --> 3498.88]  Builder units and I was like, oh, well, I thought that was the whole point
[3499.44 --> 3503.28]  Of the game was that he was or she robot. I don't know
[3503.84 --> 3506.08]  Was that your commander was very vulnerable?
[3506.64 --> 3511.68]  Um, so I just I didn't really enjoy the gameplay and I was at a time when my life was starting to get busier
[3511.68 --> 3515.28]  And they added another race and so I didn't want to learn to play a new race
[3515.28 --> 3519.60]  And I didn't know how to deal with the new race and I was like, oh, man. I thought three races was enough
[3519.68 --> 3521.68]  um
[3521.68 --> 3523.36]  So
[3523.36 --> 3527.84]  There's that problem like I was talking to someone about classic wall recently but how it's like a mastered game
[3527.84 --> 3533.12]  Yeah, when it when it comes out, it's going to be kind of problematic someone's like, oh, are you gonna pvp?
[3533.12 --> 3539.28]  I'm like, yeah, no this was an interesting conversation that we were having actually last week because I was I assumed you were gonna like
[3540.32 --> 3542.32]  Play the classic wow
[3542.32 --> 3544.32]  I'm gonna be
[3544.32 --> 3546.32]  Um, yeah, and I
[3546.32 --> 3550.08]  I will play it. I'm sure I'm gonna be poking around the community and seeing what's going on
[3550.32 --> 3556.56]  I don't know how deep I'll get into it purely because of like a question someone asked me was like
[3556.56 --> 3560.88]  Are you gonna go into pvp? It's gonna be really fun to have like an older wow
[3561.60 --> 3564.88]  PvP setup. It's like well, yeah, but I play a warrior so I'm just gonna get tooled
[3564.88 --> 3571.68]  Because all of the like very abusable mechanics of certain other classes are going to be very abused
[3572.00 --> 3573.68]  Uh because everyone knows what they are
[3574.16 --> 3580.80]  Um and like warriors. Well, that's great because we're gonna be super crazy overpowered at specific things in pve
[3581.28 --> 3583.52]  Sweet, but that's also kind of weird
[3584.16 --> 3586.16]  Right. It's not the same like back
[3586.80 --> 3590.56]  Back in the day you and your group had to try to struggle through this
[3591.52 --> 3596.96]  Thing that nobody really knew anything about in the default gear that you think you should take is actually crap and all the good gears
[3596.96 --> 3598.88]  Like blues and greens and all this weird stuff
[3599.36 --> 3604.24]  Um, and now everyone knows the perfect thing all the time no matter what and there's there's no
[3605.68 --> 3608.48]  Thought or experiment that really has to go into it, right?
[3608.64 --> 3610.16]  Everything's all perfectly well
[3610.16 --> 3612.48]  What you were calling it was a solved game. Yes
[3612.48 --> 3616.32]  Like in the same sense that like tic-tac-toe is a solved game. Yeah, so
[3616.32 --> 3622.40]  Uh, I think you were telling me that there's basically down to like how long to hold the button
[3622.88 --> 3624.88]  For the direction that you walk
[3624.88 --> 3628.48]  Like the fastest way to level up to level 60. Azeroth autopilot
[3628.64 --> 3633.92]  And it will tell you exactly who to talk to exactly where to walk everything right everything
[3634.00 --> 3638.72]  And it will just like the minimal number of clicks basically basically to get to level 60
[3638.72 --> 3642.32]  And like that's not that's not what it was like. That's not gaming. No
[3642.32 --> 3648.96]  So that's gaming the system i'll play it because i'm sure my dad and my brother will play it and it'll be cool to hang out with them
[3648.96 --> 3655.20]  And stuff uh, but but you might have more fun if you found people who have never played wow to play with almost certainly
[3655.52 --> 3659.04]  If they don't dive super hard into online guides
[3659.68 --> 3665.12]  Right just like try to play fairly ignorant, right? Which is which is and you just kind of play along
[3665.36 --> 3668.72]  Yeah, right, which is kind of weird in its own right if they release burning crusade
[3668.72 --> 3674.16]  That would be great because burning crusade as far as i know is not solved in the same way the classic is people want your straw
[3674.16 --> 3676.64]  Pull for the shirt ah, yes, I do have that
[3677.68 --> 3679.68]  Let's see if your screen cap works
[3679.92 --> 3681.92]  hey look at that
[3682.96 --> 3684.96]  oh
[3684.96 --> 3690.24]  Not exactly what i was hoping to see because i was hoping a more skewed pole would show up yeah, this is pretty uh
[3691.28 --> 3692.48]  ooh
[3692.48 --> 3696.96]  That doesn't really tell us a solid answer no so um
[3697.84 --> 3702.16]  All right, then thanks guys one thing that i have a problem with is
[3703.28 --> 3708.80]  Like the the logo also doesn't look completely 100 like chill
[3709.92 --> 3713.44]  If you know what i mean looks like if you corporate yeah if you put the logo in the corner
[3713.44 --> 3716.24]  It's still gonna look like a corporate business shirt
[3716.96 --> 3722.16]  Yeah, what if you took off the logo and just did the word mark then it's facebook
[3722.16 --> 3726.56]  If you hadn't told me that i would never have seen it
[3727.52 --> 3729.52]  But other people were a very different blue
[3731.44 --> 3732.08]  It's still blue
[3734.16 --> 3739.92]  It's pretty bad it got pointed out by one of the members on the team i believe it's yuki and like the second he said it
[3739.92 --> 3740.72]  i was like yep
[3740.72 --> 3750.08]  It starts with an f it's white text it's on a blue background it's a different f not by much it is different it is different it is 100 different but like
[3752.64 --> 3756.40]  You know what forget it let's just leave it the way it is people who
[3756.40 --> 3761.28]  Love float plane and want to support float plane will get one and people who don't well they won't to be clear
[3761.28 --> 3764.72]  There's not gonna be very many yeah, and they're all gonna be like handed out at ltx
[3764.72 --> 3769.28]  It's not like this is like an lt t-shirt design where we're like printing a thousand of them or something like that
[3769.28 --> 3778.32]  I think it's 150 and of that 150 there's like allocation to lmg allocation to float plane employees allocation to creators
[3779.60 --> 3781.76]  So there's like really not gonna be very much
[3782.64 --> 3787.04]  Uh, because we don't suspect people are gonna be way too into it people want to know when they can buy them
[3787.04 --> 3791.76]  I don't know if we will put them for sale. I think we're you were you gonna have some at ltx or something, but yeah
[3792.08 --> 3797.28]  Yeah, that's the only plan right now. I think we see it as mostly like a promotional thing like yeah, give it away. Yeah
[3797.28 --> 3799.28]  Um
[3799.28 --> 3800.96]  All right
[3800.96 --> 3805.44]  Do we have anything else that we wanted to talk about today? I don't think any official news topics. No. Yeah, okay
[3806.32 --> 3808.32]  Um all right
[3808.32 --> 3810.00]  So I guess that's it
[3810.00 --> 3814.96]  Cool see you again next week same bad time same channel
[3816.08 --> 3818.00]  Bye guys that button stops working
[3818.80 --> 3822.32]  Yeah, then we're in a we're gonna have a real bad time
[3822.32 --> 3828.32]  All right, this doesn't work. Okay, we're just gonna stop all right. That's it
[3828.72 --> 3830.72]  bye
