[0.00 → 2.00] Yes, this is cool.
[3.50 → 5.50] And...
[5.50 → 9.50] Welcome to the WAN Show, ladies and gentlemen.
[9.50 → 12.50] We've actually been streaming for like the last three hours.
[12.50 → 13.00] Three and a half.
[13.00 → 14.00] I don't know if you know that.
[14.00 → 14.50] No, I do.
[14.50 → 17.00] But have we been like crushing float plane or has it been?
[17.00 → 18.00] It's been okay.
[18.00 → 19.00] It's been okay? Cool.
[19.00 → 20.00] Yeah. Sort of.
[20.00 → 21.00] Yeah, cool.
[21.00 → 24.00] It's been okay as it like can be right now, I guess.
[24.00 → 25.00] Yeah, neat.
[25.00 → 27.50] So yeah, what's going to happen to that GOD?
[27.50 → 30.50] Like can that go live? Can your new transcode stack handle that?
[30.50 → 31.50] We can...
[32.50 → 33.50] It can.
[33.50 → 34.50] Uh-huh, uh-huh.
[34.50 → 36.50] Not like automatically.
[36.50 → 37.50] Uh-huh, cool.
[37.50 → 39.50] So yeah. You guys don't have a local recording?
[39.50 → 40.50] We do.
[40.50 → 41.50] Do we? Okay.
[41.50 → 44.50] You could... so you can do the local recording.
[44.50 → 46.50] I just mean, can you handle a three-hour video?
[46.50 → 47.50] Oh.
[47.50 → 49.50] Like how bad is that gonna... well, here's the thing.
[49.50 → 52.50] So float plane, a lot of people probably don't know this.
[52.50 → 53.50] Wink.
[53.50 → 56.50] But float planes transcode... you know what I think happens?
[56.50 → 58.50] You leave the laptop there and then you drift.
[58.50 → 59.50] Oh, because I want to centre myself on it.
[59.50 → 61.50] I think I finally figured it out.
[61.50 → 65.50] Why, you're always like five inches too far that way.
[65.50 → 66.50] All these years.
[66.50 → 68.50] That's probably legitimately it.
[68.50 → 73.50] Anyway, so float planes transcode system used to be a serial.
[73.50 → 88.50] So basically, if Linus Media Group were to upload a three-hour video, tech deals or Nitwit could end up waiting literally four hours while that all processes at all the different quality levels and all that good stuff.
[88.50 → 90.50] Yeah, that won't happen anymore.
[90.50 → 91.50] Cool.
[91.50 → 94.50] So actually almost just as like a test.
[94.50 → 95.50] Yeah.
[95.50 → 97.50] I think you guys should upload the local GOD.
[97.50 → 98.50] Okay.
[98.50 → 99.50] And we should just like see how it goes.
[99.50 → 100.50] Sure.
[100.50 → 101.50] Because that would be good.
[101.50 → 102.50] All right.
[102.50 → 105.50] So we've got a great show for you guys today, I hope.
[105.50 → 113.50] James prepared it, and then I actually told him he didn't have time to prepare the WAN show anymore.
[113.50 → 115.50] So we have whatever he was done at that point.
[115.50 → 116.50] Okay.
[116.50 → 120.50] Because we had to spend the entire day building gaming rigs.
[120.50 → 122.50] So you know the land centre.
[122.50 → 123.50] Yeah.
[123.50 → 124.50] For Unit 101.
[124.50 → 125.50] But does it.
[125.50 → 128.50] We had no time to do it basically.
[128.50 → 133.50] I've been really frustrated because that project has been sitting there for weeks.
[133.50 → 137.50] Basically ready for us to just like build it.
[137.50 → 138.50] Yeah.
[138.50 → 143.50] We just can't get our act together and get it done because they're quite complicated builds
[143.50 → 144.50] with all the RGB in them and everything.
[144.50 → 145.50] But I also thought you had to go upstairs.
[145.50 → 149.50] So we are going to have to move it upstairs, but that doesn't mean we can't build the systems.
[149.50 → 150.50] Okay.
[150.50 → 154.50] And once the systems are built, well that doesn't mean we can't put them on a desk.
[154.50 → 155.50] Eh?
[155.50 → 156.50] Eh?
[156.50 → 157.50] Eh?
[157.50 → 158.50] You know?
[158.50 → 159.50] All right.
[159.50 → 161.50] So we're putting them all on desks, and we're getting the whole thing set up because I'm
[161.50 → 164.50] just tired of staring at that and not being able to like play games.
[164.50 → 167.50] Also we have a games night planned for after work today.
[167.50 → 168.50] Yeah.
[168.50 → 169.50] So we might as well play some Vida games.
[169.50 → 170.50] Oh.
[170.50 → 173.50] So we might as well get some systems built.
[173.50 → 174.50] Oh.
[174.50 → 177.50] So we grabbed like literally half the company.
[177.50 → 182.50] Andy was a super champ and held the camera for the entire three-hour stream on an easy
[182.50 → 183.50] rig.
[183.50 → 184.50] Okay.
[184.50 → 185.50] Okay.
[185.50 → 186.50] Okay.
[186.50 → 187.50] I was like that's actually crazy.
[187.50 → 189.50] It was a C200 not a red or a C300 whatever it is.
[189.50 → 190.50] Yeah.
[190.50 → 191.50] It was one of the cannons not a red.
[191.50 → 192.50] Yeah.
[192.50 → 193.50] So that helps but like.
[193.50 → 194.50] So did you build all of them?
[194.50 → 195.50] He's a super trooper.
[195.50 → 196.50] So I built one.
[196.50 → 197.50] Oh.
[197.50 → 198.50] And it was a bad.
[198.50 → 199.50] And it was a bad scene.
[199.50 → 200.50] Yeah.
[200.50 → 201.50] And it was a bad scene.
[201.50 → 202.50] Yeah.
[202.50 → 206.50] So we had helpers like Dennis and Colton and nothing against those guys.
[206.50 → 207.50] They just don't build computers very often.
[207.50 → 209.50] Do they all still work?
[209.50 → 212.50] Well no one really screwed anything up super royally.
[212.50 → 213.50] Okay.
[213.50 → 214.50] Cool.
[214.50 → 215.50] Yeah.
[215.50 → 216.50] So there's that.
[216.50 → 217.50] Dennis built a computer.
[217.50 → 219.50] The last time he built a computer was his editing workstation.
[219.50 → 220.50] Yeah.
[220.50 → 221.50] Almost four years ago.
[221.50 → 222.50] Yeah.
[222.50 → 225.50] So no I do know when the last time he built a computer was.
[225.50 → 227.50] And it was a bad scene.
[227.50 → 228.50] Yeah.
[228.50 → 230.50] Apparently Andy missed lunch too.
[230.50 → 231.50] Yeah.
[231.50 → 232.50] So that's.
[232.50 → 233.50] We're going to buy him dinner.
[233.50 → 234.50] Yeah.
[234.50 → 235.50] Yeah.
[235.50 → 236.50] That's fair.
[236.50 → 237.50] Yeah.
[237.50 → 238.50] We'll buy him some dinner.
[238.50 → 239.50] Yeah.
[239.50 → 240.50] We'll just let that slide I think.
[240.50 → 241.50] Anyway.
[241.50 → 242.50] So sorry.
[242.50 → 243.50] We've got a.
[243.50 → 245.50] We've got a hopefully great show for you guys today.
[245.50 → 246.50] Yeah.
[246.50 → 250.50] I get to do some backtracking because I was rude last week.
[250.50 → 252.50] The US bans Huawei.
[252.50 → 255.50] Lenovo announced a folding PC.
[255.50 → 257.50] So that's interesting.
[261.50 → 262.50] Don't be a hater.
[262.50 → 263.50] We'll talk about it more later.
[263.50 → 264.50] Okay.
[264.50 → 265.50] I haven't seen it yet but like.
[265.50 → 266.50] Okay.
[266.50 → 268.50] Microsoft and Sony team up for game streaming.
[268.50 → 269.50] You know weird and stuff.
[269.50 → 273.50] And Supreme Court allows antitrust lawsuit against the app store.
[273.50 → 275.50] That's actually a very interesting.
[275.50 → 276.50] Whoa.
[276.50 → 277.50] I super wish John was here but in the meantime.
[277.50 → 278.50] Me too.
[278.50 → 279.50] We're going to have to roll the intro.
[279.50 → 280.50] Yep.
[280.50 → 281.50] Boom.
[298.50 → 299.50] We've got some sponsors.
[299.50 → 300.50] We've got some sponsors.
[300.50 → 301.50] Okay.
[301.50 → 302.50] I don't know why.
[302.50 → 303.50] There it goes.
[303.50 → 304.50] Ha.
[304.50 → 305.50] That savage turkey.
[305.50 → 306.50] Got that PIA.
[306.50 → 311.50] I am going to use the stream deck.
[311.50 → 313.50] Look I used the stream deck.
[313.50 → 314.50] What's up?
[314.50 → 315.50] Did you put that one up?
[315.50 → 316.50] Which.
[316.50 → 317.50] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[317.50 → 318.50] Okay.
[318.50 → 319.50] Yeah, I did that one first.
[319.50 → 320.50] It's all good.
[320.50 → 323.50] You might have noticed that Luke and I have adorable matching shirts today.
[323.50 → 324.50] Aww.
[324.50 → 328.50] This is the limited edition Marina's Roast shirt.
[328.50 → 333.50] So it's a caricature of me that Lloyd put together.
[333.50 → 336.50] Apparently that's what he thinks I look like which is I guess his.
[336.50 → 337.50] Giant demon eyes.
[337.50 → 338.50] Yeah, his roast.
[338.50 → 339.50] His roast.
[339.50 → 343.50] So it's kind of a play on the dog in the burning building.
[343.50 → 344.50] This is fine.
[344.50 → 345.50] Yeah.
[345.50 → 346.50] That's what it says by the way.
[346.50 → 347.50] Yeah.
[347.50 → 350.50] You've got the LTT coffee roast right there along with a coffee cup.
[350.50 → 351.50] Some flames in the background.
[351.50 → 354.50] It's on LTTstore.com if you guys want to check it out.
[354.50 → 355.50] It looks cool.
[355.50 → 356.50] Yeah, there's not going to be a ton of them.
[356.50 → 358.50] It's like slightly more abstract LTT merch.
[358.50 → 360.50] Yeah, I think we're only doing a couple of hundred of them.
[360.50 → 361.50] Yeah, okay.
[361.50 → 362.50] Yeah.
[362.50 → 366.50] I like that you guys sell these bottles now.
[366.50 → 369.50] I know I bring the bottles up a lot on the show, but it's because now there's always
[369.50 → 372.50] a tall thing of nice cold water on the show.
[372.50 → 373.50] Yeah.
[373.50 → 374.50] It's great.
[374.50 → 375.50] That Jon goes and gets for us.
[375.50 → 376.50] Yeah, the business guys are like, here you go, man.
[376.50 → 377.50] All right.
[377.50 → 382.50] So why don't we jump right into our headline topic because that was my New Year's resolution
[382.50 → 384.50] a few weeks ago.
[384.50 → 392.50] Android Authority says, and this was originally posted on the forum by Aria S.
[392.50 → 395.50] This is tremendous.
[395.50 → 398.50] Forget about foldable phones.
[398.50 → 401.50] Here's the first foldable PC.
[401.50 → 408.50] And I really like this headline because forget about foldable phones is such an appropriate
[408.50 → 414.50] thing to say given that Samsung is only now getting to the point where they're like recommitting
[414.50 → 416.50] a ship date for the Galaxy Fold.
[416.50 → 421.50] Like that thing could have ended up cancelled as far as I can tell.
[421.50 → 422.50] Yeah.
[422.50 → 423.50] So I guess.
[423.50 → 425.50] So it's just.
[425.50 → 426.50] All right.
[426.50 → 427.50] I don't.
[427.50 → 428.50] Okay.
[428.50 → 433.50] I understand the use case of foldable phones, but I don't think they're ready.
[433.50 → 434.50] Okay.
[434.50 → 435.50] I don't think they're ready.
[435.50 → 436.50] Okay.
[436.50 → 437.50] So like down the line.
[437.50 → 438.50] Back us up here.
[438.50 → 439.50] Back us way up.
[439.50 → 440.50] All right.
[440.50 → 441.50] Foldable phone for you.
[441.50 → 442.50] I.
[442.50 → 447.50] There are many times when if I'm sitting stationary somewhere for a while and I know I'm going
[447.50 → 451.50] to be waiting something, waiting for something for a while, being able to fold out a phone
[451.50 → 453.50] and having a big screen would be cool.
[453.50 → 454.50] Okay.
[454.50 → 458.50] I could more easily use like Google sheets, which is really high.
[458.50 → 459.50] Yeah.
[459.50 → 460.50] The chat's all like F.
[460.50 → 463.50] That was a long freaking cut.
[463.50 → 464.50] Okay.
[464.50 → 471.50] Well, at any rate, it seems like we're back, and I'm waiting for YouTube to.
[471.50 → 472.50] Yeah.
[472.50 → 473.50] The chat hasn't really.
[473.50 → 474.50] We're back.
[474.50 → 475.50] Ladies and gentlemen.
[475.50 → 476.50] Back.
[476.50 → 477.50] There we go.
[477.50 → 478.50] Cool.
[478.50 → 479.50] Okay.
[479.50 → 481.50] So you were talking about how making your little thing bigger is definitely a prime use
[481.50 → 482.50] case.
[482.50 → 484.50] It's a very authoritarian way of going about things.
[484.50 → 485.50] Yeah.
[485.50 → 488.50] So yeah, I like the idea of being able to expand my phone because.
[488.50 → 489.50] Oh, right.
[489.50 → 492.50] I wanted to offer a counterpoint for like working on a long email.
[492.50 → 493.50] Sure.
[493.50 → 496.50] So I actually hate typing on a tablet.
[496.50 → 503.50] And the reason is that I find it's this super awkward tweeter size where it's not big
[503.50 → 507.50] enough to type with all my hands, but not small enough to type with my thumbs.
[507.50 → 513.50] So I haven't actually used a Galaxy Fold yet, but what I want to know is if my phone was
[513.50 → 518.50] double the width, would I be able to comfortably type on it?
[518.50 → 519.50] I think I could.
[519.50 → 520.50] Okay.
[520.50 → 521.50] Fair enough.
[521.50 → 526.50] I can understand the but like if I go to, I can't really show that very well, but if
[526.50 → 528.50] I go two hands on this phone, like it's pretty cramped.
[528.50 → 531.50] I'm faster at typing on this phone with one hand.
[531.50 → 532.50] Got it.
[532.50 → 533.50] Okay.
[533.50 → 534.50] Fair enough.
[534.50 → 535.50] So I, I'm not sure because I haven't done it.
[535.50 → 536.50] That's pretty wide apart.
[536.50 → 538.50] So it's going to come down to hand size and dexterity.
[538.50 → 539.50] All right.
[539.50 → 540.50] It's okay.
[540.50 → 541.50] Okay.
[541.50 → 542.50] So you've got, I could see it.
[542.50 → 545.50] I haven't done it yet, but I could see myself liking a folding phone.
[545.50 → 546.50] That's pretty weird.
[546.50 → 547.50] This is a better picture of it, actually.
[547.50 → 548.50] Yeah.
[548.50 → 549.50] I'm just going to fire this up.
[549.50 → 550.50] That's pretty weird.
[550.50 → 553.50] I, I don't, I'm not against it.
[553.50 → 555.50] I just don't understand yet, I guess.
[555.50 → 556.50] Okay.
[556.50 → 560.50] Like it's a tablet that you can go, like, okay.
[560.50 → 570.50] Um, I just, I don't, like, why do I want that tile to be around the corner?
[570.50 → 572.50] I don't, I just, I don't know.
[572.50 → 575.50] I don't understand the use case for it.
[575.50 → 580.50] I, I'm, I am willing to accept that I could just be blind.
[580.50 → 581.50] Yeah.
[581.50 → 582.50] But I mean, I've gotten stuff wrong.
[582.50 → 584.50] I got phablets wrong.
[584.50 → 585.50] Yeah.
[585.50 → 586.50] I totally missed the mark on that.
[586.50 → 588.50] I was like, this is stupid.
[588.50 → 592.50] Anything bigger than the iPhone four is dumb because you can't use it with one hand.
[592.50 → 596.50] And now even with my small hands, I'm a note user.
[596.50 → 599.50] And like, I just, I've learned to adjust my grip.
[599.50 → 600.50] I get my pinky like way over here.
[600.50 → 601.50] I get this over here.
[601.50 → 604.50] And then I get, I get that way reach across there.
[604.50 → 606.50] Like I'll, I'll, I'll be moving it around in my hand.
[606.50 → 607.50] I actually drop it very rarely.
[607.50 → 608.50] I don't even use a case.
[608.50 → 609.50] Yeah.
[609.50 → 613.50] I've been wondering for a while if we're going to evolve to have like way more jacked pinkies.
[613.50 → 619.50] Because there's so many people supporting their phones like this with all the weight of the phone, almost all the weight on the phone on their pinky.
[619.50 → 622.50] But it has to allow it.
[622.50 → 625.50] Like it has to select for like breeding capability.
[625.50 → 632.50] And I don't think being buried in your phone with like a super, you know, dexterous pinky is going to.
[632.50 → 633.50] Tinder efficiency.
[633.50 → 634.50] Ooh.
[634.50 → 636.50] So pinkies and thumbs.
[636.50 → 637.50] Yeah.
[637.50 → 644.50] More agile, probably a little bit thinner, less meaty thumbs that can dart around faster.
[644.50 → 645.50] Yeah.
[645.50 → 646.50] And then like a jacked pinky.
[646.50 → 649.50] And beefier, slower pinkies that can just support weight.
[649.50 → 650.50] Alrighty then.
[650.50 → 651.50] Oh man.
[651.50 → 653.50] So we can talk through some of this.
[653.50 → 658.50] Now to be clear, what's really crazy about this is that it's not just like a weird concept product.
[658.50 → 660.50] Like this is a real thing.
[660.50 → 662.50] It's going to be part of their ThinkPad X1 lineup.
[662.50 → 666.50] It's got a 13.3 inch OLED display from LG.
[666.50 → 669.50] It's 2K resolution and a 4 by 3 aspect ratio.
[669.50 → 672.50] That is fascinating.
[672.50 → 673.50] That's pretty funky.
[673.50 → 676.50] Now with, so it's going to have an Intel CPU.
[676.50 → 681.50] They're aiming for full day battery with support for cellular data, making it kind of like tablet-y,
[681.50 → 686.50] but it's going to, it won't run Microsoft's OS, which opens up.
[686.50 → 690.50] Interesting possibilities for the software.
[690.50 → 693.50] It comes with a Wacom pen and a separate keyboard.
[693.50 → 704.50] So it's like more like a folding tablet, but like 13.3 inches is really, huge for a tablet.
[704.50 → 705.50] Yeah.
[705.50 → 709.50] But also like pretty small for laptop.
[709.50 → 711.50] Not, not definitely not unheard of small.
[711.50 → 714.50] There are tons of laptops in that, in that size range, but that's on the smaller side.
[714.50 → 726.50] Now one laptop running actually like kind of a, I would call it a demo on top of Windows 10 that I saw was Asus's dual screen laptop that they showed off at Computer about a year ago.
[726.50 → 729.50] So I don't know if you ever saw this.
[729.50 → 732.50] I should actually, I should bring up, I should bring up the video.
[732.50 → 736.50] Um, Asus dual screen.
[736.50 → 741.50] So Asus had some ideas at the very least for what they thought.
[741.50 → 744.50] So this is just it, but the screen doesn't fold basically.
[744.50 → 745.50] Uh, here, hold on.
[745.50 → 746.50] Let me just mute this.
[746.50 → 748.50] Um, okay.
[748.50 → 752.50] So we'll go ahead and full screen this.
[752.50 → 754.50] So it was like a Zen book on the back.
[754.50 → 755.50] There you go.
[755.50 → 756.50] Yeah.
[756.50 → 757.50] And the bottom.
[757.50 → 763.50] And then it just had a normal laptop hinge, but both surfaces here were screened.
[763.50 → 765.50] So the idea was that you had a touch sensitive keyboard here.
[765.50 → 766.50] I'm going to pause it.
[766.50 → 767.50] This might be weird.
[767.50 → 768.50] Yeah.
[768.50 → 770.50] I feel like I would prefer that more.
[770.50 → 775.50] I was going to say, I think both of them are kind of rough ideas.
[775.50 → 776.50] I don't like it.
[776.50 → 782.50] To be completely like, I'm just saying compared to the other one, if I have to pick one, I'd
[782.50 → 786.50] probably go with this one, but I still don't like it because the typing experience is going
[786.50 → 787.50] to be so bad.
[787.50 → 793.50] And if I'm going to use my laptop instead of my phone, to be fair, I might be watching something,
[793.50 → 795.50] but then I'm only going to use one of the screens.
[795.50 → 796.50] Here's the thing though.
[796.50 → 802.50] People who care about the typing experience, are they freaks?
[802.50 → 807.50] Is touch typing at 130 words per minute going to go away?
[807.50 → 811.50] Auto correction is even in like Gmail now.
[811.50 → 812.50] Yeah.
[812.50 → 816.50] And auto form fill in Gmail with tab is like pretty good.
[816.50 → 822.50] The thing to me is that I can usually, unless it's completing a particularly long phrase,
[822.50 → 829.50] I can usually type faster than I can read process and go over to tab and then, hold on a second,
[829.50 → 831.50] did it put punctuation in there or not?
[831.50 → 832.50] Like kind of refined my way.
[832.50 → 835.50] It's usually faster for me to just type it out.
[835.50 → 836.50] I'm a pretty fast typist.
[836.50 → 842.50] But clearly that feature exists for a freaking reason.
[842.50 → 847.50] So are we going to get to the point where the vast majority of what normal people would
[847.50 → 854.50] type, just like texts to friends and short emails and stuff like that, can just be heavily
[854.50 → 860.50] assisted to the point where the keyboard becomes far less important than having more screen space
[860.50 → 862.50] to multitask?
[862.50 → 863.50] Could that happen?
[863.50 → 869.50] I wonder if this is going to be my old grouchy guy that doesn't like new technology thing.
[869.50 → 871.50] Is I don't like touch interfaces.
[871.50 → 872.50] Right.
[872.50 → 873.50] The phone I'm okay with.
[873.50 → 874.50] The phone's fine.
[874.50 → 877.50] Anything outside of phone, I hate.
[877.50 → 880.50] Like if you have like a microwave or a washing machine or anything.
[880.50 → 881.50] Sure.
[881.50 → 882.50] DSLR camera?
[882.50 → 883.50] DSLR camera.
[883.50 → 886.50] If it's a touch interface, I'm probably not going to like it.
[886.50 → 895.50] So is touch typing going to become like an equivalent of shorthand where like the advent
[895.50 → 900.50] of typing really made shorthand notation kind of irrelevant?
[900.50 → 901.50] Yeah.
[901.50 → 906.50] And I wonder if like is Google's Gmail thing and whatever else that they're doing where
[906.50 → 910.50] it auto completes on tab is going to get even stronger, and it's going to get to the point
[910.50 → 913.50] where, because this happens with texting a little bit.
[913.50 → 919.50] Like I can text without looking at my phone because I know if I butcher a word and like
[919.50 → 922.50] mistype half the letters, it's still going to get it.
[922.50 → 926.50] So like does it even really, you can just type three letters per word.
[926.50 → 927.50] Well here's the thing.
[927.50 → 931.50] I wonder if speed typing in the future is going to turn into typing half of the word every
[931.50 → 932.50] time.
[932.50 → 933.50] Yeah, Microsoft owns Swift Key.
[933.50 → 938.50] So there's no reason why a Windows device like this couldn't take full advantage of
[938.50 → 941.50] Swift Key's from my experience.
[941.50 → 943.50] Very excellent predictive texting.
[943.50 → 944.50] Yeah.
[944.50 → 947.50] We've got stereo sensation backing us up here.
[947.50 → 949.50] Hell no!
[949.50 → 952.50] We type code over here.
[952.50 → 953.50] WTF.
[953.50 → 954.50] Yeah.
[954.50 → 955.50] Okay.
[955.50 → 958.50] People are always going to need to actually type the whole thing.
[958.50 → 963.50] Because if you let your auto complete like, it's, you know, okay, so auto complete like,
[963.50 → 967.50] just like sentences and having a conversation that's just like full auto complete.
[967.50 → 968.50] That's pretty funny.
[968.50 → 969.50] An auto complete program?
[969.50 → 970.50] What are you going to end up with?
[970.50 → 971.50] Flop plane.
[971.50 → 972.50] Flop plane.
[972.50 → 974.50] Just like, it doesn't fly.
[974.50 → 976.50] It is just like kind of hops along the lake.
[976.50 → 977.50] In between the trees, right?
[977.50 → 978.50] Flop plane.
[978.50 → 979.50] Flop plane.
[979.50 → 980.50] Flop plane.
[980.50 → 981.50] Flop plane.
[981.50 → 982.50] Flop plane.
[982.50 → 983.50] Flop plane.
[983.50 → 984.50] Flop plane.
[984.50 → 985.50] Flop plane.
[985.50 → 986.50] Flop plane.
[986.50 → 987.50] Flop plane.
[987.50 → 988.50] Flop plane.
[988.50 → 989.50] Flop plane.
[989.50 → 990.50] Flop plane.
[990.50 → 991.50] That would be an amazing like, April fools' joke one year.
[991.50 → 992.50] Yeah.
[992.50 → 993.50] The whole site just like goes down, and it's just floppy plane.
[993.50 → 994.50] I know Jaden could do it.
[994.50 → 995.50] For a fact.
[995.50 → 996.50] Right, because he didn't even do that.
[996.50 → 998.50] Because he basically has done it.
[998.50 → 999.50] Right, that was part of his application.
[999.50 → 1000.50] He could totally do it.
[1000.50 → 1001.50] Yeah.
[1001.50 → 1002.50] That was part of his application.
[1002.50 → 1003.50] Yeah.
[1003.50 → 1008.50] Why didn't we come up with this for April fools this year?
[1008.50 → 1011.50] I don't think we had enough time by the time we realized April fools is coming up.
[1011.50 → 1012.50] Flop plane.
[1012.50 → 1013.50] Oh, I love it.
[1013.50 → 1014.50] Oh my goodness.
[1014.50 → 1018.50] So anyway, back to Lenovo's device.
[1018.50 → 1023.50] Some press outlets did get hands on with it and based on their impressions with a functional
[1023.50 → 1028.50] prototype, the display was dim and had poor viewing angles.
[1028.50 → 1035.50] So this has to be to do with making it foldable because this is the first LG foldable OLED that I'm aware of.
[1035.50 → 1043.50] As far as I know, Samsung is using their own display and actually, don't quote me on this.
[1043.50 → 1047.50] I'm actually not 100% sure who Huawei is using for the Mate X.
[1047.50 → 1050.50] Huawei Mate X OLED supplier.
[1050.50 → 1051.50] I know there's auto-complete in programming.
[1051.50 → 1056.50] I know there's actually a fair amount of it, especially when putting in variables and stuff like that.
[1056.50 → 1058.50] We're talking about like whole sentences and stuff.
[1058.50 → 1062.50] The Gmail style auto-complete that I'm talking about is punctuation full sentence situation.
[1062.50 → 1067.50] Okay, so they're apparently sourcing from BOE display, so not LG.
[1067.50 → 1072.50] So this is the first foldable LG OLED that I'm aware of on a production device.
[1072.50 → 1074.50] And to be clear, it's a prototype, not a production device.
[1074.50 → 1083.50] But it's possible because like I know LG's Olds can be pretty freaking good from their phones, from their TVs.
[1083.50 → 1098.50] But what we don't know is what their process is for putting their foldable display materials on, or excuse me, their OLED display on like some type of foldable glass or plastic.
[1098.50 → 1099.50] Plastic.
[1099.50 → 1104.50] So, I'm out.
[1104.50 → 1105.50] I'm out.
[1105.50 → 1106.50] Personally.
[1106.50 → 1107.50] But then...
[1107.50 → 1109.50] Are we shark tanking this now?
[1109.50 → 1110.50] I guess so.
[1110.50 → 1114.50] So, I might end up eating my words because I was wrong about phablets.
[1114.50 → 1115.50] Yeah.
[1115.50 → 1117.50] That has been an absolutely...
[1117.50 → 1118.50] I'm in on phones.
[1118.50 → 1119.50] I just...
[1119.50 → 1120.50] I'm...
[1120.50 → 1123.50] They're not ready yet, so I'm not doing it because I need my phone to be primo all the time.
[1123.50 → 1128.50] Phablets have been a huge tech trend that I got completely wrong.
[1128.50 → 1133.50] Like far more wrong than I think I've been about almost anything since founding Linus Media Group.
[1133.50 → 1135.50] Like VR...
[1135.50 → 1136.50] VAR.
[1136.50 → 1137.50] I was like...
[1137.50 → 1139.50] I know you mean that, but it sounded a different way.
[1139.50 → 1140.50] I was like...
[1140.50 → 1142.50] Oh, like it sounds like I think I'm like really accurate?
[1142.50 → 1143.50] No, that...
[1143.50 → 1144.50] Oh.
[1144.50 → 1148.50] It sounds like you were very, very wrong about founding Linus Media Group.
[1148.50 → 1149.50] Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1149.50 → 1151.50] I know what you mean.
[1151.50 → 1154.50] No, I'm still...
[1154.50 → 1155.50] I'm still behind that idea.
[1155.50 → 1156.50] Okay.
[1156.50 → 1157.50] That was a pretty good idea.
[1157.50 → 1158.50] That's good.
[1158.50 → 1159.50] There you go.
[1159.50 → 1160.50] I'm pretty...
[1160.50 → 1161.50] I'm pretty low stoked on that.
[1161.50 → 1162.50] Yeah.
[1162.50 → 1163.50] And Float plane might even be okay too.
[1163.50 → 1164.50] One day.
[1164.50 → 1165.50] Yeah, we'll get there.
[1165.50 → 1166.50] I was completely wrong about that.
[1166.50 → 1175.50] So ever since that, I've been a little more hesitant to kind of say, this is a terrible
[1175.50 → 1176.50] trend.
[1176.50 → 1178.50] Manufacturers need to cut this out.
[1178.50 → 1186.50] And actually, as part of my sort of recent attempt to be a little bit less just hateful,
[1186.50 → 1187.50] I guess, and like really negative.
[1187.50 → 1188.50] Okay.
[1188.50 → 1192.50] I ended up taking a lot of flack on the OnePlus 7 Pro video.
[1192.50 → 1193.50] So...
[1193.50 → 1194.50] Because you were too not hateful?
[1194.50 → 1198.50] Well, at the beginning of the video, I basically come out, and I say, here's everything that's
[1198.50 → 1199.50] wrong with the OnePlus 7 Pro.
[1199.50 → 1205.50] And I say, it doesn't have waterproofness, or it doesn't have a waterproof certification.
[1205.50 → 1212.50] So my understanding is it actually costs a significant amount of money to get that IP rating on the
[1212.50 → 1213.50] product.
[1213.50 → 1217.50] And you can make a product that is perfectly waterproof and just not submit it.
[1217.50 → 1218.50] Water-resistant.
[1218.50 → 1219.50] Resistant, thank you.
[1219.50 → 1224.50] And just not submit it, and then it will just be that, but there's no label.
[1224.50 → 1227.50] I'm sure the price has even gone up with the amount of...
[1227.50 → 1229.50] How important a feature it is.
[1229.50 → 1230.50] Yeah.
[1230.50 → 1231.50] Yeah.
[1231.50 → 1234.50] It's become a much more popular feature on a range of devices these days.
[1234.50 → 1239.50] So we know already from our tour of OnePlus's factory that they do make efforts to make
[1239.50 → 1240.50] their devices water-resistant.
[1240.50 → 1242.50] They just don't pay for the certification.
[1242.50 → 1246.50] So I called out that it didn't have that certification, doesn't have wireless charging,
[1246.50 → 1248.50] which for a lot of people is a big deal.
[1248.50 → 1254.50] You should get them to partner up with you to do a project and give you like a bunch
[1254.50 → 1261.50] of phones and get like Alex and James or something to rig up a system that like dunks
[1261.50 → 1262.50] them on timers.
[1262.50 → 1265.50] We create our own like cheaper certification.
[1265.50 → 1267.50] The like L...
[1267.50 → 1268.50] LIP.
[1268.50 → 1269.50] Yeah.
[1269.50 → 1270.50] Yeah.
[1270.50 → 1271.50] Probably not.
[1271.50 → 1274.50] I don't want to be responsible for that.
[1274.50 → 1276.50] I'd be interested in...
[1276.50 → 1281.50] I don't know if I'd actually make a real certification for it, but like I'd be interested in seeing you
[1281.50 → 1282.50] guys do the testing.
[1282.50 → 1284.50] That would be kind of fun, actually.
[1284.50 → 1286.50] Anyway, where was I going with this?
[1286.50 → 1287.50] Right.
[1287.50 → 1291.50] So then the other thing that I criticized was the lack of a headphone jack.
[1291.50 → 1292.50] Yeah.
[1292.50 → 1295.50] So I said, this is all the negative things about it, this.
[1295.50 → 1300.50] And then I said, but I'm not going to harp on that too much because most, the vast majority
[1300.50 → 1304.50] of flagship phones these days don't have a headphone jack.
[1304.50 → 1308.50] And I got a lot of flack for not like hating on it enough.
[1308.50 → 1310.50] And here's the thing guys.
[1310.50 → 1315.50] I am not giving up my headphone jack anytime soon, which is a big part of the reason that
[1315.50 → 1320.50] in spite of how much I love the OnePlus 7 Pro and the performance that it gives, this is
[1320.50 → 1322.50] back in my pocket.
[1322.50 → 1323.50] Yeah.
[1323.50 → 1324.50] Samsung Note 9.
[1324.50 → 1325.50] Got that headphone jack.
[1325.50 → 1327.50] Got that wireless charging.
[1327.50 → 1328.50] Got that everything.
[1328.50 → 1331.50] This phone, just like, I love this phone to be honest with you.
[1331.50 → 1332.50] It doesn't have the greatest camera.
[1332.50 → 1334.50] I accept that.
[1334.50 → 1341.50] Samsung's OS, quite frankly, is just not as snappy as OnePlus's Oxygen OS.
[1341.50 → 1345.50] But I'm willing to accept that because I actually use the stylus once in a while now.
[1345.50 → 1346.50] Really?
[1346.50 → 1347.50] I never thought I'd care.
[1347.50 → 1349.50] I don't think I've ever seen you use a stylus.
[1349.50 → 1351.50] I use it very occasionally.
[1351.50 → 1357.50] So like when I was going to Ikea a few weekends ago, I took a picture of my space, popped out
[1357.50 → 1361.50] the stylus, wrote all the measurements on my picture, and then I had that as a reference.
[1361.50 → 1362.50] When I was at the store.
[1362.50 → 1363.50] Cool.
[1363.50 → 1365.50] You can do it with your finger, but it's harder.
[1365.50 → 1367.50] That was actually why I was a little bit longer ago.
[1367.50 → 1369.50] It was while I was reviewing the S10+.
[1369.50 → 1372.50] So I was like trying to do it with the S10, and I was like, this is annoying.
[1372.50 → 1375.50] I'm going to go grab my Note 9 and just do it on the Note because it's easier.
[1375.50 → 1376.50] Yeah.
[1376.50 → 1377.50] So there you go.
[1377.50 → 1378.50] Stylus.
[1378.50 → 1379.50] Anyway.
[1379.50 → 1384.50] What do you think about the 3A having a headphone jack and 3A XL?
[1384.50 → 1388.50] I'm annoyed that headphone jacks are being treated like a budget feature.
[1388.50 → 1390.50] Like you couldn't afford wireless earphones.
[1390.50 → 1391.50] Yeah.
[1391.50 → 1393.50] So you need a headphone jack.
[1393.50 → 1396.50] Because a lot of more premium audio experiences-
[1396.50 → 1397.50] Are wired.
[1397.50 → 1398.50] Do rely on the headphone jack.
[1398.50 → 1399.50] Yeah.
[1399.50 → 1400.50] Exactly.
[1400.50 → 1405.50] So the thing though is that this is a trend that I personally thought was very obvious.
[1405.50 → 1408.50] As soon as Apple removed the headphone jack, I was like, this is terrible.
[1408.50 → 1409.50] This is a terrible trend.
[1409.50 → 1410.50] This needs to not happen.
[1410.50 → 1413.50] And I remember having a very enlightening conversation.
[1413.50 → 1416.50] Every once in a while, it's good to talk to a normal person.
[1416.50 → 1417.50] Like a not techie person.
[1417.50 → 1418.50] Yeah.
[1418.50 → 1423.50] And so I was chatting with the guy that runs the badminton centre that I usually hang out
[1423.50 → 1424.50] at.
[1424.50 → 1429.50] And I was like, yo, so you got the iPhone 7.
[1429.50 → 1430.50] Sup?
[1430.50 → 1431.50] Sup?
[1431.50 → 1432.50] How's that going?
[1432.50 → 1434.50] And he's like, yeah, I love it.
[1434.50 → 1437.50] And I'm like, doesn't have a headphone jack.
[1437.50 → 1439.50] And he's like, oh yeah.
[1439.50 → 1442.50] And I was like, is that going to be a problem for you?
[1442.50 → 1444.50] And he's like, are you kidding me?
[1444.50 → 1449.50] I switched to Bluetooth earphones like two years ago, and he uses Jaybirds.
[1449.50 → 1453.50] And he's like, yeah, I haven't plugged anything to a headphone jack in years.
[1453.50 → 1455.50] And I was like, oh.
[1455.50 → 1456.50] Oh.
[1456.50 → 1460.50] And I was like, but those don't sound very good.
[1460.50 → 1462.50] And he's like, sounds good enough for me.
[1462.50 → 1465.50] I'm like, but you have to charge them.
[1465.50 → 1467.50] He's like, yeah, I got to charge my phone too.
[1467.50 → 1469.50] I'm like, but this.
[1469.50 → 1470.50] But.
[1470.50 → 1473.50] I'm trying to catch you on something.
[1473.50 → 1474.50] I'm trying to catch you on something here.
[1474.50 → 1476.50] So then there's my aunt who I love to pick on.
[1476.50 → 1477.50] Yeah.
[1477.50 → 1479.50] She's never worn headphones in her life.
[1479.50 → 1482.50] Oh, well, all right.
[1484.50 → 1485.50] Yeah.
[1485.50 → 1493.50] So what I have to kind of accept here and what I have to hope for, I have to accept that needing
[1493.50 → 1499.50] wired headphones is becoming more and more niche as time passes.
[1499.50 → 1504.50] And what I have to hope is that someone is going to carry the torch.
[1504.50 → 1507.50] LG seems pretty committed to it still.
[1507.50 → 1508.50] But here's the thing.
[1508.50 → 1511.50] Their mobile handset division is really struggling.
[1511.50 → 1518.50] So clearly this group of people that's like, yeah, headphone jack, rah, rah, rah.
[1518.50 → 1520.50] I'm going to buy headphones with headphone jacks.
[1520.50 → 1521.50] Woo.
[1521.50 → 1525.50] It's clearly not enough to, you know, keep LG alive.
[1525.50 → 1532.50] Um, that is unless Samsung ditches it and all those people do actually move over to LG.
[1532.50 → 1533.50] So we'll see if that happens.
[1533.50 → 1540.50] But in the meantime, I'm still really sincerely hoping that Samsung is going to continue to
[1540.50 → 1542.50] support the headphone jack.
[1542.50 → 1548.50] Um, I don't, I don't know if, uh, something died.
[1548.50 → 1549.50] Are we back?
[1549.50 → 1550.50] Something did die, but we're good.
[1550.50 → 1556.50] I don't know if, I don't know if I am putting my faith in the wrong place, but, um, that's,
[1556.50 → 1557.50] that's all I really have.
[1557.50 → 1558.50] Cause who else hasn't ditched it yet?
[1558.50 → 1560.50] You got LG, you got Samsung.
[1560.50 → 1562.50] I mean, Google brought it back with the 3A.
[1562.50 → 1566.50] That would be an amazing thing for Google to bring back with the pixel 4.
[1566.50 → 1567.50] I'd be so stoked.
[1567.50 → 1571.50] I would switch to the pixel 4 because we would surely be rid of the notch by then.
[1571.50 → 1574.50] Notches were a stupid, horrible trend.
[1574.50 → 1580.50] I have never daily driven a notch phone and I will never do it because full screen display,
[1580.50 → 1582.50] our full display screens are here now.
[1582.50 → 1583.50] Full display screens.
[1583.50 → 1586.50] Full, what do we call them?
[1586.50 → 1587.50] Whatever.
[1587.50 → 1588.50] All display phones.
[1588.50 → 1589.50] Full frontal.
[1589.50 → 1590.50] Yeah.
[1590.50 → 1591.50] Full frontal.
[1591.50 → 1592.50] Thank you.
[1592.50 → 1596.50] All display phones are already here and there's great ones like the OnePlus 7 Pro if you're
[1596.50 → 1597.50] into that.
[1597.50 → 1602.50] Um, like the Galaxy Note 9 which, okay, fine, it isn't full, but whatever, this strip at
[1602.50 → 1604.50] the top, you weren't going to use it anyway.
[1604.50 → 1605.50] Deal with it.
[1605.50 → 1607.50] Um, like we have massive display phones already.
[1607.50 → 1610.50] There's no reason to use a notched phone in my opinion.
[1610.50 → 1614.50] Um, so I just hope that I have some kind of option.
[1614.50 → 1619.50] A Pixel 4 with a headphone jack and no notch would be my phone, quite honestly.
[1619.50 → 1620.50] Yeah.
[1620.50 → 1621.50] I'd do it.
[1621.50 → 1622.50] I'd give up the stylus.
[1622.50 → 1623.50] I'd give up the stylus.
[1623.50 → 1625.50] That I use like once a month.
[1625.50 → 1626.50] Yeah.
[1626.50 → 1628.50] That's not a it doesn't sound like a huge sacrifice.
[1628.50 → 1630.50] I also like scribbling on screenshots with it.
[1630.50 → 1632.50] So I, oh, oh, I posted.
[1632.50 → 1633.50] But couldn't you just finger that?
[1633.50 → 1634.50] Yeah, it's harder.
[1634.50 → 1636.50] Like this one right here.
[1636.50 → 1642.50] So I posted on Twitter earlier this week with a screenshot of the monetization tab in the
[1642.50 → 1645.50] YouTube dashboard for the roast.
[1645.50 → 1647.50] How far back does this go?
[1647.50 → 1648.50] A lot of tweets, man.
[1648.50 → 1649.50] Was this a while ago?
[1649.50 → 1650.50] Oh yeah, there it is.
[1650.50 → 1651.50] Oh yeah, okay.
[1651.50 → 1652.50] Yeah, okay.
[1652.50 → 1654.50] So I'm like, I got like my thumbs up.
[1654.50 → 1656.50] I'm circling stuff, drawing faces.
[1656.50 → 1659.50] It really is a lot easier to do with the stylus.
[1659.50 → 1660.50] Sorry, it looks kind of like that.
[1660.50 → 1662.50] Also, I have an update on that.
[1662.50 → 1668.50] So the video does actually have some AdSense revenue now, which is pretty cool.
[1668.50 → 1672.50] But earlier today, we got a yellow icon.
[1672.50 → 1673.50] Oh.
[1673.50 → 1674.50] Yellow icon, baby.
[1674.50 → 1675.50] There it is.
[1675.50 → 1676.50] You guys can't see it.
[1676.50 → 1677.50] Whatever it's in there.
[1677.50 → 1678.50] I'm not surprised at that one.
[1678.50 → 1679.50] I'm not.
[1679.50 → 1682.50] I mean, we self-reported that it contained strong language and all that kind of stuff.
[1682.50 → 1683.50] So it is what it is.
[1683.50 → 1684.50] Yeah.
[1684.50 → 1691.50] But yep, we are not going to be making up the shortfall in our budgeting for that with
[1691.50 → 1692.50] the yellow icon.
[1692.50 → 1695.50] To be clear, Marina's held up their end of the bargain.
[1695.50 → 1699.50] We just blew a lot more money on the event than we had originally planned.
[1699.50 → 1702.50] Like flying people out to attend it and all that kind of stuff.
[1702.50 → 1704.50] So it is what it is.
[1704.50 → 1705.50] We had a lot of fun.
[1705.50 → 1706.50] Buy a shirt.
[1706.50 → 1707.50] Yeah.
[1707.50 → 1708.50] Yeah.
[1708.50 → 1709.50] There you go.
[1709.50 → 1710.50] They are pretty cool.
[1710.50 → 1711.50] If I could say so myself.
[1711.50 → 1712.50] I think they are pretty sweet.
[1712.50 → 1713.50] Buy a shirt.
[1713.50 → 1715.50] That's all I have to say.
[1715.50 → 1716.50] You know what?
[1716.50 → 1717.50] I got to wonder.
[1717.50 → 1719.50] There are 8,000 people watching the WAN show now.
[1719.50 → 1723.50] How many of them have been watching us for like four hours today?
[1723.50 → 1726.50] Like streaming all day.
[1726.50 → 1729.50] You guys streamed for a long time.
[1729.50 → 1730.50] You know what?
[1730.50 → 1731.50] I want to straw pull this.
[1731.50 → 1732.50] Can you straw pull this up?
[1732.50 → 1733.50] Yeah.
[1733.50 → 1734.50] Got you.
[1734.50 → 1735.50] Folding PCs.
[1735.50 → 1736.50] Like, okay, right.
[1736.50 → 1737.50] So back to the headphone thing.
[1737.50 → 1738.50] The reason.
[1738.50 → 1742.50] So I took a bunch of flack for this in the 7 Pro review.
[1742.50 → 1748.50] And the reason that I had hedged my bets was I didn't want to pick that hill that I'm dying on again.
[1748.50 → 1754.50] And turn out to be wrong, especially from my experience talking to normal people who just plain don't care.
[1754.50 → 1755.50] Yeah.
[1755.50 → 1756.50] Okay.
[1756.50 → 1757.50] One quick thing.
[1757.50 → 1759.50] Do we want to make this a poll just about folding PCs?
[1759.50 → 1761.50] Or should we ask about folding phones as well?
[1761.50 → 1762.50] No.
[1762.50 → 1763.50] Folding phones are happening.
[1763.50 → 1764.50] Okay.
[1764.50 → 1765.50] That's like, there's no question.
[1765.50 → 1768.50] So we want to know, are we missing the mark on folding PCs?
[1768.50 → 1769.50] Is that going to be a thing?
[1769.50 → 1773.50] Or do we already have PCs that fold exactly as much as they need to?
[1773.50 → 1778.50] With a proper clamshell that contains a proper keyboard and at worst a trackpad.
[1778.50 → 1780.50] So Luke's going to fire that up.
[1780.50 → 1784.50] I'm going to go ahead and get into our sponsors while we go ahead and get that going.
[1784.50 → 1788.50] So first up, we've got private internet access.
[1788.50 → 1793.50] PIA is the VPN for you and me and her simultaneously.
[1793.50 → 1794.50] That's right.
[1794.50 → 1799.50] You can install PIA on up to five devices at the same time with a single account.
[1799.50 → 1805.50] They've got apps for Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Linux, and Google Chrome.
[1805.50 → 1810.50] With PIA, you can dial in exactly the level of privacy protection that you need.
[1810.50 → 1813.50] They've got support for a variety of protocols and levels of encryption.
[1813.50 → 1817.50] Their apps include DNS leak protection and IPv6 leak protection.
[1817.50 → 1822.50] And their internet kill switch will block all traffic if the VPN becomes disconnected unexpectedly.
[1822.50 → 1826.50] So check it out at leg.GG slash Pagan.
[1826.50 → 1829.50] Go get private internet access for yourself.
[1829.50 → 1835.50] Also sponsoring the show today, Savage Jerky got that maple buffalo bacon!
[1835.50 → 1837.50] I'm so hungry. I haven't had lunch today.
[1837.50 → 1839.50] I'm salivating so hard right now. I'm so excited.
[1839.50 → 1841.50] They got me mine.
[1841.50 → 1843.50] Oh, Jalapeño. I love this one.
[1843.50 → 1850.50] Savage Jerky. The goal was to create a snack that without nitrates or preservatives that's full of flavour, but that isn't bad for you.
[1850.50 → 1855.50] They've got 13 different flavours of jerky like the sriracha bacon and maple buffalo bacon.
[1855.50 → 1857.50] I'm so happy right now.
[1857.50 → 1859.50] They also make barbecue sauce.
[1859.50 → 1862.50] Do you do barbecue sauce on pasta? Have I asked you this before?
[1862.50 → 1864.50] If you have barbecue sauce, I'm sorry, hot sauce.
[1864.50 → 1868.50] Hot sauce. Yeah, okay. You've asked me the hot sauce one before. Not barbecue.
[1868.50 → 1871.50] I was like, you've evolved. I can't keep up.
[1871.50 → 1874.50] I don't know if I can get into that. Have you tried it?
[1874.50 → 1875.50] Not yet.
[1875.50 → 1876.50] You should try it.
[1876.50 → 1878.50] Yeah. I actually had pasta recently. I just completely forgot.
[1878.50 → 1885.50] Like six drops of the, um, I forget if it's the ghost pepper one that I've been really enjoying lately.
[1885.50 → 1888.50] It's either the ghost pepper one or the, um, the Reaper.
[1888.50 → 1891.50] No, I think it's the Reaper one that I've been, that I've been eating lately.
[1891.50 → 1893.50] Like six drops of that on a, on a plate of pasta.
[1893.50 → 1895.50] It just puts a nice little kick into it.
[1895.50 → 1897.50] Absolutely love it.
[1897.50 → 1902.50] Um, anyway, the Carolina Reaper hot sauce uses one of the hottest peppers in the world, the Carolina Reaper.
[1902.50 → 1909.50] And you can use offer code LTT to save 10% at savage jerky.com.
[1909.50 → 1913.50] We also have a new sponsor today.
[1913.50 → 1916.50] So I'm going to have to read these labels.
[1916.50 → 1917.50] Hmm.
[1917.50 → 1919.50] This is the hive.
[1919.50 → 1922.50] Uh, this one's for Luke or the Dover for Luke.
[1922.50 → 1923.50] Hmm.
[1923.50 → 1924.50] Okay.
[1924.50 → 1926.50] Oh, the box is apparently engraved.
[1926.50 → 1927.50] Oh yeah.
[1927.50 → 1928.50] Yeah.
[1928.50 → 1929.50] That's cool.
[1929.50 → 1930.50] Okay.
[1930.50 → 1931.50] So your watches.
[1931.50 → 1942.50] So they're best known for their wood designs, but they're continuing to expand their boundaries to include other natural elements such as, do you have a what's that one made of?
[1942.50 → 1944.50] Apparently they have marble watches as well.
[1944.50 → 1946.50] These are, these all appear to be wood designs.
[1946.50 → 1953.50] Uh, they have a huge selection and the ability to personalize makes Word a great place to go for gifts for dad.
[1953.50 → 1954.50] Oh yeah.
[1954.50 → 1955.50] Father's Day is coming up.
[1955.50 → 1956.50] That makes sense.
[1956.50 → 1957.50] Right.
[1957.50 → 1958.50] Okay.
[1958.50 → 1959.50] Cool.
[1959.50 → 1961.50] A lot of people have noticed I've been wearing the galaxy watch.
[1961.50 → 1962.50] Yeah.
[1962.50 → 1963.50] You notice anything about it?
[1963.50 → 1964.50] It's off.
[1964.50 → 1965.50] It's dead.
[1965.50 → 1971.50] So my goal is actually to wear this watch continuously for a month.
[1971.50 → 1976.50] Not because I actually like it, but because I'm trying to make a point about smartwatches in general.
[1976.50 → 1978.50] I'm really unhappy with the state of them.
[1978.50 → 1983.50] So I'm going to review this after having not charged it for a month.
[1983.50 → 1989.50] And I'm going to review it in the context of how my life really didn't change because it was so worthless already anyway.
[1989.50 → 1992.50] Um, I really, really don't like the smartwatch.
[1992.50 → 1995.50] And then maybe I might just go back to a dumb watch anyway.
[1995.50 → 1997.50] I'm going to throw this on because, uh,
[1997.50 → 1998.50] You're not dumb, Word watch.
[1998.50 → 2000.50] I got to tell you guys about Word watches right now.
[2000.50 → 2001.50] You're beautiful.
[2001.50 → 2002.50] Word or Word?
[2002.50 → 2003.50] It's probably Word.
[2003.50 → 2004.50] Word.
[2004.50 → 2010.50] Anyway, so they've got a huge selection and the ability to personalize to make Word a great place for a gift for dad.
[2010.50 → 2011.50] Uh, Father's Day is coming up.
[2011.50 → 2018.50] Uh, so they've got personalized engraving available on the watches as well as their cedar humidor boxes.
[2018.50 → 2022.50] They've got a generous return and exchange policy, free worldwide shipping, and a great warranty.
[2022.50 → 2027.50] So, uh, use offer code LTT19 to get, OOP, there we go.
[2027.50 → 2033.50] LTT19 to get $25 off and free sizing at leg.GG slash lordly.
[2033.50 → 2035.50] So, this one's really cool.
[2035.50 → 2037.50] Are you wearing the same one as me right now?
[2037.50 → 2038.50] Where it, like, self-wines?
[2038.50 → 2039.50] Oh, yeah, yeah.
[2039.50 → 2042.50] So, this is one of those movement wound ones.
[2042.50 → 2044.50] And you can actually see the mechanism inside it.
[2044.50 → 2045.50] I'm sorry.
[2045.50 → 2046.50] Should be showing this to you guys.
[2046.50 → 2047.50] I don't know if yours has this.
[2047.50 → 2048.50] Really cool.
[2048.50 → 2050.50] And mine, it's a little hard to see for the camera.
[2050.50 → 2051.50] Oh, there.
[2051.50 → 2052.50] There you go.
[2052.50 → 2053.50] You can actually see it moving around there.
[2053.50 → 2054.50] So, that's pretty cool.
[2054.50 → 2056.50] Through the back and through the front.
[2056.50 → 2058.50] It passes through completely.
[2058.50 → 2060.50] You can feel the momentum swing a little bit.
[2060.50 → 2061.50] That's actually really cool.
[2061.50 → 2062.50] Yeah.
[2062.50 → 2063.50] Yeah, well, that's awesome.
[2063.50 → 2064.50] So, Word watches.
[2064.50 → 2065.50] Check them out.
[2065.50 → 2067.50] More details at the link in the video description.
[2067.50 → 2069.50] Very cool.
[2069.50 → 2070.50] All right.
[2070.50 → 2074.50] So, we've got a few more things to cover for Wan show here.
[2074.50 → 2081.50] Oh, first, I want to jump in and apologize to our folks with autism spectrum disorder.
[2081.50 → 2086.50] So, I had said last week that Asperger's is no longer considered its own diagnosis.
[2086.50 → 2094.50] But I made it seem as though being a high functioning person on the autism spectrum is not valid.
[2094.50 → 2101.50] So, the way that Asperger's was changed is such that it isn't its own discrete diagnosis anymore.
[2101.50 → 2109.50] But that doesn't mean that it is not still classified as sort of high functioning part of the autism spectrum.
[2109.50 → 2110.50] Okay.
[2110.50 → 2117.50] So, some people were upset because they felt like I was making it sound like Asperger's wasn't a thing.
[2117.50 → 2118.50] It's still a thing.
[2118.50 → 2123.50] It just doesn't have the same label because it's just considered part of the autism spectrum now.
[2123.50 → 2124.50] Right.
[2124.50 → 2129.50] Some people were also upset because I had said we're all kind of on the autism spectrum.
[2129.50 → 2134.50] What I had intended to say by that was that everyone feels that way sometimes.
[2134.50 → 2141.50] But yes, they made an excellent point that autism is considered an excessive amount of that kind of feeling or those kinds of behaviours.
[2141.50 → 2146.50] And so, some people were emailed me and were pretty upset because they were like,
[2146.50 → 2155.50] look, it's hard enough as sort of high functioning person with autism to explain to people that no, it's not the same as just being shy.
[2155.50 → 2156.50] Right.
[2156.50 → 2161.50] And so, I felt like that was a very fair thing to bring up with me and I should probably clarify it on the show this week.
[2161.50 → 2162.50] Cool. That makes sense.
[2162.50 → 2165.50] So, there you go.
[2165.50 → 2170.50] In other news, this is from scmp.com or Engadget depending on who you prefer.
[2170.50 → 2171.50] The US...
[2171.50 → 2172.50] Uh...
[2172.50 → 2173.50] Oh, no. Let's get back to...
[2173.50 → 2175.50] Oh, let's get back to our survey first.
[2175.50 → 2180.50] So, Luke Screen, are we missing the mark on folding PCs?
[2180.50 → 2182.50] I love your options.
[2182.50 → 2186.50] Uh, 774 of you say, nope, they are exactly as trash as you think.
[2187.50 → 2190.50] And, uh, 18% say, yes, they're going to be massive.
[2190.50 → 2192.50] You really didn't leave a lot of room for middle ground here.
[2192.50 → 2194.50] Some people pointed out that there wasn't a middle answer.
[2194.50 → 2196.50] I did that on purpose.
[2196.50 → 2197.50] Um...
[2197.50 → 2200.50] Because I guess if you're going to be a futurist with a crystal ball, you have to pick.
[2200.50 → 2201.50] Yeah.
[2201.50 → 2202.50] Alright.
[2202.50 → 2204.50] You, like, being wishy-washy and be like, oh, they might be niche.
[2204.50 → 2208.50] You could classify almost anything as niche as long as the company keeps making it.
[2208.50 → 2209.50] Like, it's...
[2209.50 → 2211.50] Are they going to make it or no?
[2211.50 → 2212.50] Yeah.
[2212.50 → 2213.50] I don't know.
[2213.50 → 2214.50] This is a giant piece of bacon.
[2214.50 → 2215.50] That is a massive piece of bacon.
[2215.50 → 2216.50] And I'm going to put it in my mouth hole.
[2216.50 → 2217.50] Oh my goodness.
[2217.50 → 2218.50] I'm so happy.
[2218.50 → 2219.50] I love that.
[2219.50 → 2220.50] I'm so happy.
[2220.50 → 2221.50] I'm so happy.
[2221.50 → 2222.50] I'm so happy.
[2222.50 → 2223.50] Okay.
[2223.50 → 2224.50] Um...
[2224.50 → 2225.50] Um...
[2225.50 → 2226.50] I'm...
[2226.50 → 2227.50] I'm going to be jumping to US bans Huawei.
[2227.50 → 2228.50] Sure.
[2228.50 → 2229.50] Oh boy.
[2229.50 → 2231.50] So the US Commerce Department has added Huawei and 70 affiliates.
[2231.50 → 2232.50] Whoa.
[2232.50 → 2233.50] 70.
[2233.50 → 2246.50] To its entity list that bans the telecom giant from buying parts and components from
[2246.50 → 2249.50] US companies without US government approval.
[2249.50 → 2251.50] Also known as just no.
[2251.50 → 2252.50] Um...
[2252.50 → 2254.50] It also makes it difficult to...
[2254.50 → 2259.50] It also makes it difficult, if not impossible, for Huawei to sell some products because of
[2259.50 → 2261.50] its reliance on US suppliers.
[2261.50 → 2266.50] If they don't think this is going to come back to bite them...
[2266.50 → 2269.50] I don't know, man.
[2269.50 → 2270.50] So...
[2270.50 → 2274.50] I feel like quite a few US manufacturers are going to get wrecked because of this.
[2274.50 → 2276.50] Because it's just gonna...
[2276.50 → 2281.50] This is just a punch for punch, eye for eye trade war that's been going on with US and
[2281.50 → 2282.50] China and Canada to a certain degree.
[2282.50 → 2286.50] I mean, we're not going to get too political because that's not really our jam on this show.
[2286.50 → 2287.50] That's fair.
[2287.50 → 2288.50] Um...
[2290.50 → 2291.50] Can I just sort of...
[2291.50 → 2295.50] Can we have, like, a stupid people debate right now?
[2296.50 → 2299.50] The concern with Huawei is that it provides a back door into China.
[2299.50 → 2305.50] And while my understanding is that particularly their carrier grade, like their backhaul grade
[2305.50 → 2308.50] equipment has never actually been demonstrated to...
[2308.50 → 2309.50] To do that.
[2309.50 → 2311.50] ...send data back to China.
[2311.50 → 2312.50] Yeah.
[2312.50 → 2316.50] It has been noted that it's not particularly well-coded.
[2316.50 → 2317.50] So that's one thing.
[2317.50 → 2318.50] Yeah.
[2318.50 → 2323.50] And the main concern seems to be that Huawei, as essentially a state-run company, as many
[2323.50 → 2330.50] of them are over in China, would be at the mercy of the Chinese government to add such functionality
[2330.50 → 2333.50] in the future should they decide that they require it.
[2333.50 → 2334.50] So that seems to be the concern.
[2334.50 → 2338.50] Another major concern I've heard, again, not trying to get political, just talking about
[2338.50 → 2342.50] things I have heard on the internet, is killed switch stuff.
[2342.50 → 2348.50] If there was to be a conflict of some sort, and you could just turn off the other people
[2348.50 → 2352.50] communications, or a significant part of it, I know there's other layers and stuff, but
[2352.50 → 2355.50] if you could turn off a significant part of the communications, that would be a pretty
[2355.50 → 2356.50] big deal.
[2356.50 → 2357.50] Okay.
[2357.50 → 2361.50] So that seems to be the major concern with using Huawei communications equipment.
[2361.50 → 2363.50] As far as I know, yes.
[2363.50 → 2364.50] Okay.
[2364.50 → 2367.50] So can I propose an alternative viewpoint?
[2367.50 → 2368.50] Mm.
[2368.50 → 2375.50] Why should anyone else be comfortable using American equipment?
[2375.50 → 2378.50] Or anyone else's equipment for that matter?
[2378.50 → 2381.50] No, particularly American equipment.
[2381.50 → 2388.50] Is China's record for spying on its citizens that much worse?
[2388.50 → 2389.50] I don't know.
[2389.50 → 2390.50] I don't know.
[2390.50 → 2391.50] I don't know.
[2391.50 → 2393.50] I have no idea.
[2393.50 → 2395.50] No clue.
[2395.50 → 2396.50] No clue.
[2396.50 → 2400.50] To be clear, as far as we know, yes, it is worse.
[2400.50 → 2401.50] No.
[2401.50 → 2408.50] But, as a foreign national, so I am neither Chinese nor American, should I be comfortable
[2408.50 → 2410.50] with either of these options?
[2410.50 → 2411.50] Anyway.
[2411.50 → 2424.50] So, US President Donald Trump, back to the decision, saying it will prevent American technology
[2424.50 → 2431.50] from being used by foreign-owned entities in ways that will potentially undermine US national
[2431.50 → 2436.50] security or foreign policy interests.
[2436.50 → 2441.50] So, separately, the President signed an executive order declaring a national emergency barring
[2441.50 → 2444.50] the use of telecommunications equipment made by companies that are deemed to be a threat
[2444.50 → 2445.50] to national security.
[2445.50 → 2450.50] Didn't name China or Chinese companies specifically, but this clears the way for an outright ban on
[2450.50 → 2452.50] products made by Huawei.
[2452.50 → 2455.50] Huawei has said, this decision is in no one's interest, which…
[2455.50 → 2464.50] And it will do significant economic harm to the American companies with which Huawei does business,
[2464.50 → 2471.50] affect tens of thousands of American jobs, and disrupt the current collaboration and mutual trust that exists on the global supply chain.
[2471.50 → 2472.50] Fair points.
[2472.50 → 2473.50] Probably.
[2473.50 → 2474.50] So, we'll see how that goes.
[2474.50 → 2488.50] To go back to you should you trust American ones either, and to tie back into my can you trust anyone's thingamajigs.
[2488.50 → 2489.50] Sure.
[2489.50 → 2496.50] Especially if you're just a civilian, chilling, talking to your buds.
[2496.50 → 2510.50] If you're… you probably shouldn't trust these communication layers super deeply at all, regardless of who's running some of the back-end hardware,
[2510.50 → 2514.50] because of how easy it is to spy on and tap in on these things.
[2514.50 → 2515.50] So, we've got…
[2515.50 → 2518.50] Whether it's your computer or your phone or something in between.
[2518.50 → 2523.50] So, we've got people saying that the reason you should…
[2523.50 → 2524.50] Here, hold on.
[2524.50 → 2525.50] Blah, blah, blah.
[2525.50 → 2528.50] There's due process in America versus China.
[2528.50 → 2529.50] It's a different story.
[2529.50 → 2531.50] The government having a stake in the company.
[2531.50 → 2532.50] All this kind of stuff.
[2532.50 → 2538.50] I mean, the thing is, remember, you don't really need a stake in the company to force it to comply to your laws.
[2538.50 → 2545.50] And while there's always sort of the way that things are done traditionally during peacetime,
[2545.50 → 2559.50] there are a lot of emergency powers that can be exercised by the American government as well in the event of, like, declaring a national emergency or declaring war or whatever the case may be.
[2559.50 → 2568.50] Like, if you every kind of read into that stuff, it's actually kind of scary the way that they can just kind of, like, take land and use it for stuff and that sort of thing.
[2568.50 → 2569.50] Yeah.
[2569.50 → 2570.50] So, yeah.
[2570.50 → 2571.50] I don't know.
[2571.50 → 2573.50] Property as in everything, including not land.
[2573.50 → 2585.50] To be clear, I don't actually believe that the American government is on China's level when it comes to the monitoring of its population.
[2586.50 → 2588.50] I don't think they're there.
[2588.50 → 2590.50] I don't think they're likely to catch up.
[2590.50 → 2594.50] But there are well-documented cases of funky town stuff that has happened.
[2594.50 → 2595.50] Mm-hmm.
[2595.50 → 2596.50] So…
[2596.50 → 2598.50] Including in Canada.
[2598.50 → 2599.50] We'll see.
[2599.50 → 2604.50] If you want to hear something really NATO about Canada, look up the Canadian Spy Palace.
[2604.50 → 2607.50] That's, like, actually what it's called.
[2609.50 → 2610.50] So, yeah.
[2610.50 → 2612.50] There's, you know, it's…
[2612.50 → 2615.50] Should I trust Canadian telecoms' equipment?
[2615.50 → 2617.50] We have a spy palace!
[2617.50 → 2618.50] Who knows?
[2619.50 → 2620.50] Yeah, I don't know.
[2620.50 → 2623.50] If it doesn't look like the Fortress of Solitude, I'm going to be disappointed.
[2623.50 → 2626.50] It's actually, like, quite stunning.
[2626.50 → 2627.50] Really?
[2627.50 → 2629.50] It's a really beautiful building, actually.
[2629.50 → 2630.50] I'm looking it up.
[2630.50 → 2631.50] Yeah.
[2631.50 → 2632.50] Spy…
[2632.50 → 2633.50] Palace…
[2633.50 → 2636.50] It's massive and costs an insane amount of money, too.
[2636.50 → 2637.50] Hold on, hold on.
[2637.50 → 2638.50] Let's…
[2638.50 → 2639.50] On a Canadian scale.
[2639.50 → 2640.50] Let's all experience this together.
[2640.50 → 2642.50] Spy Palace, Canada.
[2642.50 → 2645.50] Um, Canada's top secret billion dollar spy palace.
[2645.50 → 2649.50] Anytime billion dollar and Canada are involved, it's like, whoa.
[2649.50 → 2650.50] Yeah, that's inside.
[2651.50 → 2652.50] Ha!
[2652.50 → 2653.50] Yeah.
[2653.50 → 2654.50] That's the spy palace.
[2654.50 → 2655.50] Yeah.
[2655.50 → 2656.50] Money.
[2656.50 → 2658.50] Fat stacks.
[2658.50 → 2660.50] Well, actually, tax dollars hard at work.
[2660.50 → 2661.50] What do we spend Canada's money on?
[2661.50 → 2662.50] Spy palace.
[2662.50 → 2663.50] What up?
[2663.50 → 2665.50] Billions of dollars.
[2665.50 → 2667.50] Really fancy staircase.
[2667.50 → 2670.50] Screw these citizens.
[2670.50 → 2675.50] Let's talk about the Supreme Court allowing the antitrust lawsuit against the app store.
[2675.50 → 2676.50] So this is…
[2676.50 → 2677.50] Okay.
[2677.50 → 2679.50] I wish we had John here because he's always good to talk to about this kind of legal stuff.
[2679.50 → 2680.50] Me too.
[2680.50 → 2681.50] But there are a few things that I do know.
[2681.50 → 2693.50] So one is that this doesn't mean that Apple has been found guilty or that they… they have to open up alternate app stores for… on the iPhone or anything like that.
[2693.50 → 2702.50] All it means is that the Supreme Court voted five to four on Monday to allow the antitrust lawsuit to proceed.
[2702.50 → 2704.50] So it hasn't been won yet.
[2704.50 → 2705.50] And basically the lawsuit is this.
[2705.50 → 2711.50] They're accusing Apple of maintaining a monopoly on iOS apps via the app store.
[2711.50 → 2713.50] Now this case was dismissed back in 2013.
[2713.50 → 2717.50] But the court of appeals for the Ninth Circuit allowed it to return in 2017.
[2717.50 → 2720.50] And Apple's pushback brought it to the Supreme Court.
[2720.50 → 2723.50] Though only to decide whether it can continue, not the final outcome.
[2723.50 → 2733.50] So it's related to a 2011 case arguing that with the app store being the only place for iOS downloads, you're stuck with artificially inflated prices.
[2733.50 → 2736.50] Which… is a pretty valid point.
[2736.50 → 2744.50] With that said, Apple argues that developers set the prices and that it's not in violation of any antitrust laws.
[2744.50 → 2751.50] So by paying its commission, developers are buying a package of services which include distribution and software and intellectual property and testing.
[2751.50 → 2755.50] Now with that said, they are obviously maintaining a monopoly.
[2755.50 → 2764.50] And they are setting the pricing of the distribution of software and intellectual property and testing, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[2764.50 → 2768.50] And Apple's price is 30%, which is not insignificant.
[2768.50 → 2770.50] And $100 a year.
[2770.50 → 2771.50] Oh.
[2771.50 → 2773.50] Yeah, I guess we're launching an iOS app soon, aren't we?
[2773.50 → 2774.50] Yeah.
[2774.50 → 2776.50] So did we pay that already or is that just coming soon?
[2776.50 → 2777.50] The $100?
[2777.50 → 2778.50] Yeah.
[2778.50 → 2781.50] Technically, it hasn't been paid yet, but it will be very soon.
[2781.50 → 2782.50] Neat.
[2782.50 → 2783.50] Oh yeah, Float plane's launching an app soon.
[2783.50 → 2784.50] Yeah.
[2784.50 → 2785.50] Hey!
[2785.50 → 2788.50] Oh, and they called me already and things are moving forward.
[2788.50 → 2790.50] So it should be ready a lot faster than we suspected.
[2790.50 → 2799.50] So, if Apple loses the case, it might be forced to not only allow third-party app stores, but to pay up to triple in damages as a deterrent.
[2799.50 → 2800.50] Okay, so…
[2800.50 → 2801.50] Do you think this is a good thing?
[2801.50 → 2802.50] I have a question.
[2802.50 → 2804.50] I don't know legal stuff.
[2804.50 → 2805.50] Yeah.
[2805.50 → 2806.50] I don't think either of us do.
[2806.50 → 2810.50] So, be ready for a bunch of ignorance to come out of my mouth.
[2810.50 → 2813.50] But, they're essentially a marketplace, right?
[2813.50 → 2814.50] Mm-hmm.
[2814.50 → 2815.50] Float plane's a marketplace.
[2815.50 → 2816.50] Mm-hmm.
[2816.50 → 2824.50] Could someone get mad at us and say that we have a monopoly on Float plane creators being able to join the platform?
[2824.50 → 2828.50] And say that someone else should be able to run a marketplace on Float plane?
[2828.50 → 2830.50] As far as I know, no.
[2830.50 → 2833.50] But, I think that you would have a harder time…
[2833.50 → 2834.50] It's because they sell the phone?
[2834.50 → 2837.50] So, the thing is that Float plane has competitors.
[2837.50 → 2838.50] Like…
[2838.50 → 2839.50] But there's Android.
[2839.50 → 2840.50] Like, video.
[2840.50 → 2843.50] So, yes, there's Android.
[2843.50 → 2855.50] But, I think once you reach a certain scale, the way that antitrust laws work is that you're not allowed to monopolize, like, anything that's too big.
[2855.50 → 2860.50] And so, I think you could probably make the argument that iOS users are kind of their own jam.
[2860.50 → 2866.50] Now, that's obviously part of the argument that's going to be made, but I think Apple's going to come back and say, well, yeah, you could just buy an Android phone.
[2866.50 → 2868.50] Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay.
[2868.50 → 2869.50] Yes.
[2869.50 → 2874.50] So, you could go after us for that, but you'd get wrecked, because there are many competitors.
[2874.50 → 2875.50] Mm-hmm.
[2875.50 → 2882.50] And for them, like, leaving the ecosystem of iOS is probably so difficult that you might be able to argue…
[2882.50 → 2883.50] And damaging.
[2883.50 → 2884.50] And damaging.
[2884.50 → 2885.50] Yes.
[2885.50 → 2888.50] …that you might be able to argue that it's a monopolized group of people. Okay. Interesting.
[2888.50 → 2890.50] So, we'll see how it goes.
[2890.50 → 2893.50] I think…
[2893.50 → 2901.50] What do you think? I think this would actually be pretty damaging to the appearance of iOS and Apple, personally.
[2901.50 → 2904.50] I think that this would be damaging to the iOS ecosystem in general.
[2904.50 → 2905.50] Yeah.
[2905.50 → 2908.50] I actually fully support Apple maintaining their lockdown on the App Store, to be perfectly honest.
[2908.50 → 2910.50] It might not be a popular view.
[2910.50 → 2915.50] It's been very annoying for us trying to get onto it, because it takes a lot longer.
[2915.50 → 2921.50] Getting onto the Google Store is like, oh, you got an app? You don't want to put it on the truck? Cool. You're in.
[2921.50 → 2930.50] iOS Store, you have to go through this lengthy application process, and then when you go to upload your app, they have to review it for a long time, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[2930.50 → 2941.50] But it lines up with the clean and pristine kind of idea that iOS and Apple is and has. So, I don't know.
[2941.50 → 2948.50] So, yeah. This is perfect from Laser Bolt. Monopoly doesn't necessarily mean there's only one company. It just means they control the market.
[2948.50 → 2949.50] Someone brought up in here.
[2949.50 → 2950.50] Yeah.
[2950.50 → 2952.50] Is the PlayStation Online Store Monopoly?
[2954.50 → 2958.50] Maybe. So, if Apple loses this, then maybe.
[2958.50 → 2959.50] This is going to be fascinating.
[2959.50 → 2960.50] This is going to be fascinating.
[2960.50 → 2966.50] This has a huge impact for software marketplaces everywhere.
[2966.50 → 2968.50] Now, I would say Steam is not.
[2968.50 → 2971.50] Especially now. I mean, five years ago, ooh, maybe.
[2971.50 → 2978.50] But right now, Steam is not a monopoly, because game developers can go to Play, or they can go to Epic Game Store.
[2978.50 → 2981.50] Oh, no. Sorry. They can't go to Play. They can go to Epic Game Store, though.
[2981.50 → 2982.50] Why can't they go to Play?
[2982.50 → 2983.50] Did Play take third party?
[2983.50 → 2984.50] Oh.
[2984.50 → 2985.50] I don't know.
[2985.50 → 2986.50] Yeah, I'm not sure about that.
[2986.50 → 2987.50] Origin does.
[2987.50 → 2988.50] Okay.
[2988.50 → 2989.50] I'm not sure if Play does or not.
[2989.50 → 2990.50] Either way.
[2990.50 → 2991.50] Either way.
[2991.50 → 2992.50] I'm not sure if Play does or not.
[2992.50 → 2993.50] Either way.
[2993.50 → 3001.50] It's pretty clear Steam is not a monopoly, but there are definitely situations like the PlayStation, where that would be a very, very similar situation.
[3001.50 → 3004.50] Nintendo, too. Nintendo is such a walled garden.
[3004.50 → 3011.50] Yeah, some people are saying you can buy PlayStation keys from elsewhere, but you still have to use the store.
[3011.50 → 3015.50] So does it matter? Maybe it does matter?
[3015.50 → 3017.50] I'm not sure. I don't know.
[3017.50 → 3022.50] Maybe Sony's lawyers thought that that was a good protection for this. I don't know.
[3022.50 → 3025.50] Because this has clearly been going on for eight years now.
[3025.50 → 3029.50] Yeah. Yeah. The whole thing's fascinating. I don't know anything about legal stuff.
[3029.50 → 3034.50] All right. So I think it's time for me to go play some video games. Are you staying for the game tonight?
[3034.50 → 3035.50] LTD? Yeah.
[3035.50 → 3037.50] Oh, nice. Okay.
[3037.50 → 3043.50] Yeah, but we should definitely talk about some LTX stuff. Also, LTTstore.com.
[3043.50 → 3048.50] Oh, wait. No. Water bottles, I think, are out of stock. But hats. Have you seen the hats yet?
[3048.50 → 3051.50] Yeah. Yeah, because Jon is wearing one.
[3053.50 → 3054.50] So the hats are pretty nice.
[3054.50 → 3055.50] Oh.
[3055.50 → 3060.50] Hey. LTT. What's really cool, and I'm sure some people are going to see...
[3060.50 → 3062.50] I actually don't wear hats this way. I usually wear them like this, but...
[3062.50 → 3063.50] Because I'm an idiot.
[3063.50 → 3065.50] Deal with it.
[3065.50 → 3066.50] So...
[3067.50 → 3069.50] It keeps my neck from getting burned.
[3069.50 → 3070.50] Oh, yeah.
[3070.50 → 3072.50] Anyway, so these hats...
[3072.50 → 3073.50] You've got to wear another one the other way to keep the sun out of your eyes.
[3073.50 → 3076.50] These are one of the first merch items we've ever done...
[3076.50 → 3077.50] I don't really wear hats.
[3077.50 → 3081.50] ...that is specifically designed to not have Linus Tech Tips on it anywhere.
[3081.50 → 3083.50] Here, I'll...
[3083.50 → 3085.50] Does that make you feel better?
[3085.50 → 3086.50] Yeah.
[3086.50 → 3089.50] So Linus Tech Tips is not on this.
[3089.50 → 3094.50] And the reason for that is that LTT is going to sort of be becoming its own brand.
[3095.50 → 3096.50] Oh.
[3096.50 → 3097.50] Yeah.
[3097.50 → 3098.50] So we just...
[3098.50 → 3099.50] Interesting.
[3099.50 → 3100.50] We want the merch...
[3100.50 → 3104.50] Like, aside from stuff like this that's clearly commemorative of a video.
[3104.50 → 3109.50] Aside from stuff like this, we want the merch to just be stuff that you might actually want to wear.
[3109.50 → 3110.50] Yeah.
[3110.50 → 3111.50] You might actually want to, like, use.
[3111.50 → 3112.50] Yeah.
[3112.50 → 3115.50] So we're going to start to do a little bit more stealthy stuff like this.
[3115.50 → 3116.50] So this is the first step.
[3116.50 → 3117.50] That's cool.
[3117.50 → 3118.50] I think that makes sense.
[3118.50 → 3120.50] Where if you want to wear a hat that, like, just kind of looks cool...
[3120.50 → 3125.50] Because with this, if someone doesn't know that this means Linus Tech Tips, they're not probably going to worry about it.
[3125.50 → 3126.50] Yeah, they just won't care.
[3126.50 → 3127.50] Yeah.
[3127.50 → 3128.50] Whatever you're wearing a hat.
[3128.50 → 3132.50] We've had a lot of people ask for a black one with orange LTT.
[3132.50 → 3134.50] That will come at some point.
[3134.50 → 3138.50] The reason that we did it this way was that we really couldn't get the orange right.
[3138.50 → 3140.50] It didn't look good.
[3140.50 → 3145.50] So we are sticking with the single colour ones for now.
[3145.50 → 3149.50] So it's black, blue, and we debated this earlier.
[3149.50 → 3150.50] Is this maroon or burgundy?
[3150.50 → 3152.50] I don't know what maroon looks like.
[3152.50 → 3154.50] Alright, so I'm going to vote with burgundy?
[3154.50 → 3155.50] Yeah, everyone said burgundy.
[3155.50 → 3156.50] I'm assuming you said maroon?
[3156.50 → 3158.50] I did, but I forget what maroon looks like.
[3158.50 → 3159.50] I think it's more brown.
[3159.50 → 3160.50] I think it's more burgundy.
[3160.50 → 3161.50] I think I was wrong.
[3161.50 → 3163.50] So LTTstore.com.
[3163.50 → 3165.50] We also need to...
[3165.50 → 3166.50] Sup?
[3166.50 → 3167.50] Sup?
[3167.50 → 3169.50] Oh, yeah, I wasn't that far off.
[3169.50 → 3170.50] That's kind of maroon-y.
[3170.50 → 3171.50] What's burgundy?
[3171.50 → 3172.50] Here, hold on.
[3172.50 → 3174.50] We've got to get Luke's screen on over here.
[3174.50 → 3175.50] So Luke's looking this up.
[3175.50 → 3177.50] That's maroon in the corner under the...
[3177.50 → 3179.50] Mind you, you're on a razor blade stealth, so like...
[3179.50 → 3182.50] Who knows what it actually looks like?
[3182.50 → 3184.50] Ah, it's pretty burgundy.
[3184.50 → 3185.50] If that tie was...
[3185.50 → 3186.50] But yeah, it's burgundy.
[3186.50 → 3187.50] These are all different colours.
[3187.50 → 3188.50] Well, whatever.
[3188.50 → 3190.50] I'm not even mad.
[3190.50 → 3192.50] Okay, let's see if we have an update on LTX.
[3192.50 → 3194.50] They're supposed to update the blog every week.
[3194.50 → 3196.50] Oh, wow, BYOC is sold out again.
[3196.50 → 3197.50] Boom.
[3197.50 → 3198.50] Gone.
[3198.50 → 3202.50] If you purchased either the BYOC or VIP ticket,
[3202.50 → 3206.50] more information and seat selection is coming your way via email the week of June 10th.
[3206.50 → 3208.50] In the email, there will be a link to the Dream hack Discord,
[3208.50 → 3212.50] which will be the primary source of communication for all things BYOC going forward.
[3212.50 → 3216.50] Keep an eye out for the exact date and time a few days before seat selection goes live.
[3216.50 → 3218.50] Are you an indie dev or streamer?
[3218.50 → 3221.50] You could have the opportunity to showcase your game at the Dream hack Indie Playground,
[3221.50 → 3225.50] or stream live right from the event at Dream hack Stream Studio.
[3225.50 → 3229.50] Fill out the applications linked below by Saturday, June 7th for the team to review,
[3229.50 → 3232.50] and wait to hear back if you've been selected.
[3232.50 → 3233.50] Looking for a place to stay?
[3233.50 → 3237.50] Check out this hotel, minutes from the Vancouver Convention Centre at a special rate.
[3237.50 → 3238.50] Still don't have tickets.
[3238.50 → 3239.50] There's no time like now.
[3239.50 → 3240.50] Go, go, go.
[3240.50 → 3241.50] Get them.
[3241.50 → 3242.50] Buy them tickets.
[3242.50 → 3243.50] Buy them tickets.
[3243.50 → 3245.50] It's going to be a good show.
[3245.50 → 3247.50] We're actually really excited about it.
[3247.50 → 3248.50] Yeah, me too.
[3248.50 → 3250.50] All the float plane guys are coming.
[3250.50 → 3251.50] Anything else?
[3251.50 → 3253.50] We got them their place they're going to stay.
[3253.50 → 3254.50] It's exciting.
[3254.50 → 3255.50] I'm super stoked.
[3255.50 → 3256.50] The BYOC is going to be huge.
[3256.50 → 3257.50] 590 seats now.
[3257.50 → 3258.50] That's amazing.
[3258.50 → 3259.50] Freaking awesome.
[3259.50 → 3260.50] Oh my God.
[3260.50 → 3266.50] July 27th and 28th, 11am to 6pm each day at the Vancouver Convention Centre.
[3266.50 → 3271.50] It's all about bringing people together to offer hands-on experiences with PC hardware
[3271.50 → 3275.50] and gaming, workshops, activities, competitions, giveaways, all kinds of cool stuff.
[3275.50 → 3279.50] Come and learn how to build a PC, debit a CPU, disassemble a GPU,
[3279.50 → 3281.50] get some anger out by throwing PC cases.
[3281.50 → 3283.50] They're going to be Mac Pro towers.
[3283.50 → 3284.50] Those are...
[3284.50 → 3289.50] I feel terrible, but they were the only ones that that Free Geek had that were like
[3289.50 → 3290.50] all the same weight.
[3290.50 → 3294.50] They're in terrible condition if that helps at all.
[3294.50 → 3295.50] Yeah, it does.
[3295.50 → 3299.50] But like I saw the like pallet of them, and I was sad.
[3299.50 → 3301.50] Those are really nice towers.
[3301.50 → 3306.50] Yeah, we're going to try and salvage one and use it for like a mod or something, but like...
[3306.50 → 3310.50] The cases from last year were so rude.
[3310.50 → 3311.50] No, no, I mean before.
[3311.50 → 3313.50] Okay, I was like what?
[3313.50 → 3314.50] Anyway.
[3314.50 → 3315.50] Alright.
[3315.50 → 3316.50] Thanks for watching guys.
[3316.50 → 3317.50] See you again next week.
[3317.50 → 3320.50] Same bat time, same bat channel.
[3320.50 → 3323.50] Oh shoot, I got the sizing around.
[3323.50 → 3324.50] Sorry, I'm just adjusting this.
[3324.50 → 3325.50] It's like way too big for me.
[3325.50 → 3327.50] Oh, it was too small for me.
[3327.50 → 3329.50] Yeah, that's better.
[3329.50 → 3330.50] Oh man.
[3330.50 → 3331.50] Alright.
[3331.50 → 3335.50] You know when I was a kid, I was this kid with like the tuft sticking out of the front
[3335.50 → 3336.50] of the hat.
[3336.50 → 3337.50] This was like...
[3337.50 → 3338.50] There, that was it.
[3338.50 → 3339.50] This was my style.
[3339.50 → 3340.50] Yeah, I could see it.
[3340.50 → 3341.50] Yeah.
[3341.50 → 3342.50] Yeah.
[3342.50 → 3345.50] Yeah.
[3345.50 → 3346.50] .
