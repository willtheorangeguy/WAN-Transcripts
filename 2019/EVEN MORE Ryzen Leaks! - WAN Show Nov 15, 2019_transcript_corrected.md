[0.00 → 8.80] Welcome to the WAN show. I promise that I'm late for a good reason.
[10.22 → 11.92] Are you going to say what it is?
[13.60 → 19.58] Well, okay. So actually, I know I always end up doing a bunch of videos last minute on a Friday
[19.58 → 24.72] because I didn't get them done earlier in the week. But this week, we actually did a bunch
[24.72 → 29.64] of really cool videos that were very, very time-consuming. We did a build guide for the first
[29.64 → 35.12] time since Anthony. This is the first one I've done in over a year because Anthony did our last
[35.12 → 41.90] one. So we did a build guide. It's like a value AMD gaming build guide. So people are going to,
[42.06 → 46.94] you guys are going to love it. It's great. We converted my garage into a home theatre.
[48.04 → 50.20] So that was pretty sick. Is it staying?
[51.72 → 57.52] I'm on the fence. So okay. Okay. Think of it. Okay. Now we're getting into the discussion.
[57.52 → 62.66] You know what? Okay. Well, one second. Wait, what's going on? Why is this? There we go.
[62.94 → 69.12] All right. So basically, there are a couple of reasons for it. One is that it gets whoever's
[69.12 → 75.40] enjoying a movie away from kids who make noise. And also kids who are sleeping away from movies
[75.40 → 76.40] that make noise. Right.
[76.40 → 83.58] A, right? Okay. Number two is that, see, it might be a little bit early, but once autonomous vehicles
[83.58 → 89.84] and car sharing are really ubiquitous, I think people are going to be converting their garages
[89.84 → 91.70] because they're not going to have cars anymore.
[91.80 → 93.50] To things, doesn't it? Like whatever.
[93.50 → 99.20] So that's a trend that I'm like, I want to be on the, on the, the, the forefront, you
[99.20 → 103.70] know, the razor's edge. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, capturing back because I don't know
[103.70 → 107.76] if you know this, but when you're shopping for whether it's a house or condo or whatever
[107.76 → 113.88] the case may be, the developer doesn't actually get to count garage space as square footage
[113.88 → 124.24] of the building. So, so basically I am salvaging back like another, you know, 200 square feet
[124.24 → 130.20] or whatever of house. And all I have to do, because I've already got insulated walls on the
[130.20 → 136.18] outside my garage. All I have to do is put like a heater in there or like take out the
[136.18 → 139.42] insulation on the inside walls or something. The insulated walls were in there when we were
[139.42 → 142.52] working there, right? Yeah, but it was cold because there was no heat. Yeah. But what I was
[142.52 → 146.56] going to say is it wasn't that cold. It was pretty cold. It was pretty cold.
[146.60 → 152.08] You'll run warm, dude. But yeah. But I was going to say like, if you did put on a big jacket
[152.08 → 157.70] or something, you're pretty all right. Ed had one of those heat dishes under his desk, pointed
[157.70 → 163.98] at his groin. Okay. He was keeping his gonads from freezing, literally. Okay. All right.
[165.24 → 169.80] That's fair. You know, okay. So we got a great- But okay. You had some heat.
[169.80 → 176.14] Right, right. And last minute, we planned a trip where I'm going down and doing two of
[176.14 → 181.02] the most exciting collabs ever. Okay. So I'm going to be down in LA next week. And we're
[181.02 → 186.44] going to be working with Nitwit on the collab where it's my wife versus wifey sauce.
[186.44 → 191.68] Oh, nice. Build challenge. All they get to use are their husband's videos for how to build
[191.68 → 199.34] a PC. And I'm going to let you guys in on something. I tried to cheat. I tried to cheat
[199.34 → 202.90] and it ended up not working for me. Oh.
[202.90 → 207.42] So you know how we had discussed, you know, maybe what I should do is I should do a new
[207.42 → 210.32] build guide. And you just filmed a new build guide.
[210.82 → 211.98] Different one. Okay.
[211.98 → 217.18] So also, did I shoot-Wow. Did I shoot that other build guide this week, Nick? Do you remember?
[217.74 → 222.42] I think that was last week. Last week. Okay. Whatever. The point is, it wasn't that one.
[222.68 → 227.82] It was the POV build guide. Because I had really thought, like, from a first-person perspective,
[227.82 → 229.58] might have been really nice for her. Yeah.
[229.84 → 232.44] That one's not going to be done in time. Ah, okay.
[232.48 → 234.28] So it's not going to be up. That's interesting, though.
[234.28 → 238.48] She's going to have to go dig through the archive to find useful videos on how to build a PC.
[238.48 → 242.30] Maybe she'll watch Anthony's. Nice. That's kind of funny.
[242.46 → 247.92] So yeah, that's really cool. And we're doing a second collab, this time with Justine.
[248.08 → 252.50] And we're finally doing the Premiere versus Final Cut Pro editing challenge.
[252.94 → 254.12] Oh. Yeah.
[254.68 → 256.88] Interesting. So is Terran still editing?
[257.10 → 260.32] Terran. So this has a ton of moving pieces.
[260.62 → 264.76] Yeah. Guys, don't blame any of these people if they don't end up participating.
[264.76 → 272.38] There's a thousand reasons why someone might end up having to bail. And it's like, I'm sure it's nothing personal because everyone wants to participate.
[272.76 → 272.96] Okay.
[272.96 → 278.68] But this is like the greatest crossover since, you know, the Avengers meet Superman or whatever.
[278.90 → 279.18] All right.
[279.24 → 281.10] Okay. So it's going to be me.
[281.78 → 282.44] You're editing?
[283.00 → 284.36] No, I'm just like hosting.
[284.42 → 284.72] Okay.
[284.82 → 285.30] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[285.30 → 285.82] Heavens no.
[285.98 → 286.72] That's all. It's like, what?
[286.80 → 287.52] Me? Terran?
[288.26 → 290.22] I don't know if you're supposed to mention other people yet.
[290.32 → 290.74] Oh, really?
[291.36 → 292.26] I'm not sure.
[292.26 → 295.82] Does it matter? They're confirmed, but like, I'm already saying.
[296.08 → 298.92] I feel like the sanctity of the competition, you're not supposed to mention it.
[299.24 → 299.72] Oh.
[300.24 → 302.74] Maybe that's not the case. That was what I had heard before.
[302.76 → 304.14] I don't even know all of them, though.
[304.16 → 305.16] Like, does Terran know?
[306.34 → 307.58] Well, he doesn't watch WAN show.
[308.26 → 309.34] Yeah, I know, but.
[309.38 → 316.76] Yeah. Okay. I'll just mention one. Okay? I'll just mention one. So I'll be there. Terran will be there. Justine will be there.
[316.76 → 321.18] Nico from Corridor Digital is planning to be there.
[321.38 → 322.44] What is he going to edit on?
[322.54 → 323.20] He's not editing.
[323.50 → 323.80] Oh.
[324.84 → 327.12] Can I mention whose video they're editing?
[327.94 → 328.26] No.
[328.52 → 329.16] Oh, okay.
[329.18 → 329.54] Definitely not.
[329.64 → 332.60] Oh, okay. So I can't mention that. Okay, whatever. The point is.
[332.66 → 333.18] That makes sense.
[333.20 → 339.58] It's going to be freaking awesome. Okay. Anyway, it's going to be awesome. So it turns out I'm going to be out of town for a lot of time.
[339.58 → 342.48] Wait a second.
[342.76 → 346.30] Oh, right. With Kyle. I don't remember the name of it for whatever reason.
[346.72 → 346.86] Yeah.
[347.16 → 348.88] But he used to have this segment.
[348.98 → 349.52] Nitwit. Awesome sauce.
[349.58 → 350.18] Oh, I know that.
[351.12 → 351.92] Forever or Kyle.
[351.96 → 353.22] He used to have this segment.
[353.26 → 353.72] New egg TV.
[355.42 → 356.14] Awesome hardware.
[356.42 → 359.14] They play, I think it's normally Counter-Strike against each other.
[359.48 → 359.74] Yeah.
[359.94 → 364.36] But they have these cards that they can play against each other that are like nerd-sports style.
[364.36 → 365.64] Oh, really? Like handicaps?
[365.64 → 370.00] Yeah, you have to like to wear Hulk hands, and I'm going to like to kill you for a while in Counter-Strike.
[370.26 → 374.34] And it was, I used to love watching those. So while you're down there.
[374.40 → 375.32] Wait, did you say Kyle?
[375.60 → 375.80] Yeah.
[375.92 → 377.18] Oh, I didn't know he did that.
[377.24 → 377.46] Yeah.
[377.60 → 377.82] Oh.
[378.20 → 378.44] Yeah.
[378.80 → 379.38] Are you sure?
[379.38 → 380.04] I don't remember what it's called.
[380.30 → 381.00] A hundred percent.
[381.14 → 381.34] Huh.
[382.56 → 386.72] Because he would go against Wifey Sauce. That was their whole thing.
[386.86 → 387.16] All right.
[390.42 → 393.72] Oh, I'm guessing Nick is here to promote an LTTstore.com promo.
[393.72 → 393.98] Yes.
[394.18 → 394.86] Is that why you're here?
[395.02 → 395.54] Yeah, of course.
[395.96 → 396.30] All right.
[396.34 → 397.16] What do we have this week?
[397.18 → 398.42] You guys haven't done the intro yet to the show?
[398.46 → 400.94] We have not done the intro yet to the show, but that's okay.
[401.02 → 402.10] We can do your promo first.
[402.12 → 402.48] Oh, Geez.
[402.72 → 402.96] Okay.
[403.44 → 404.30] Oh, wow.
[404.42 → 407.16] So we've gone and put this shot at the very top of the store.
[407.24 → 409.44] That was very helpful and considerate of us.
[411.04 → 414.98] Should we put someone, should we put a different picture as the first one?
[414.98 → 416.76] Are you talking about the underwear picture?
[416.76 → 417.24] Yeah.
[417.66 → 419.30] Maybe like, what do you think?
[419.30 → 419.78] That's part of the promo.
[419.82 → 420.26] This one?
[420.44 → 420.86] This one?
[421.20 → 421.96] No, no, I know.
[421.96 → 426.86] But maybe just like, you know, just a shot of like underwear instead of me half naked.
[427.02 → 427.72] Yeah, we can do that.
[428.26 → 429.06] I mean, we don't have to.
[429.10 → 431.48] If you just want to look at that every time you go to LTTstore.com.
[431.54 → 433.04] You probably go there more than anyone else.
[433.74 → 435.78] Actually, I don't go to the public store very often.
[436.00 → 439.22] I think there are a lot of people that go there more often than I do, and they appreciate it very much.
[439.22 → 439.48] Do they?
[439.48 → 440.20] All right, all right.
[440.76 → 441.78] All right, fair enough, fair enough.
[441.78 → 442.32] Every night.
[442.80 → 444.30] You can, you can, oh God.
[444.48 → 452.66] So guys, the promo this week is bought a three pack of underwear and get an LTT water bottle for...
[452.66 → 454.38] $9.90.
[454.86 → 455.98] $9.90.
[456.30 → 456.52] Really?
[456.58 → 457.20] Is that what you said it to?
[457.22 → 460.78] Because it's a percentage thing in the back end, and they can't do points of a percentage.
[461.26 → 461.64] Okay.
[461.64 → 462.58] So it's $9.90.
[462.80 → 465.06] So it's supposed to be $10, but you know what?
[465.40 → 466.94] These dimes off on me.
[467.20 → 467.36] Yeah.
[467.96 → 469.08] 67% off.
[469.08 → 471.26] So buy underwear, get water bottle.
[471.64 → 475.68] It's, it kind of makes sense for us to promo the underwear because we just got another shipment.
[475.80 → 480.44] So we got a big shipment, and we've seen a real pattern in the underwear where people buy one package
[480.44 → 486.64] and then they come back and buy two more packages because nine is the right number of underwear to have
[486.64 → 487.84] if you do your laundry every week.
[488.00 → 488.46] Get it?
[488.54 → 489.24] Buying packages?
[489.50 → 490.46] Sorry, I'll move on now.
[490.46 → 490.86] Oh.
[491.72 → 495.90] Maybe a lot of people buy with this one and try them out.
[495.90 → 499.86] Maybe sometime between now and Christmas we'll have more deals on underwear.
[500.08 → 500.46] Oh, will we?
[500.50 → 501.74] Where you can buy even more deals.
[502.00 → 502.22] Really?
[502.22 → 503.06] Buy even more underwears.
[503.12 → 503.30] Really?
[504.02 → 504.54] Oh, I don't know.
[504.58 → 504.90] We'll see.
[505.00 → 505.22] Maybe.
[505.36 → 505.74] Yeah, we'll see.
[505.76 → 506.92] You didn't read that email that I sent you.
[507.00 → 507.34] No problem.
[507.44 → 508.28] I did read the email.
[508.44 → 509.66] I just read it at the beginning of the week.
[509.66 → 512.30] It's in, and it's out, Nick.
[512.54 → 513.38] It's in and it's out.
[514.06 → 514.66] All right.
[514.74 → 518.16] So our main topics today are AMD Ascendant.
[518.58 → 520.38] Ry zen 9 3950X.
[520.52 → 523.94] Reviews are in and the 3990X has leaked.
[524.88 → 525.98] Project Nightingale.
[526.18 → 530.36] Google apparently collected the health records of 50 million Americans without their knowledge.
[530.54 → 532.20] Isn't that a charming thing to do?
[532.40 → 532.58] Yeah.
[532.64 → 533.18] What else we got?
[533.18 → 538.24] I was actually on Nitwit's page trying to find those videos, which I don't think he's done them in a while.
[539.22 → 540.98] Unless you maybe imagined them.
[541.22 → 542.64] I don't think I did.
[544.38 → 546.14] But maybe Flow plane exclusive?
[546.60 → 550.54] If they're not like super performing well on channel or something, which is maybe why he killed it.
[550.58 → 550.96] I don't know.
[551.04 → 551.42] I'm not sure.
[551.62 → 552.44] Or ran out of ideas.
[552.56 → 553.22] I have no idea.
[554.24 → 555.48] Maybe I ran out of ideas.
[555.84 → 562.08] Apple launching 16-inch MacBook Pro with a new, old, better keyboard.
[562.08 → 566.78] Also, the Motorola Razr foldable phone for $1,500.
[567.36 → 569.02] Yeah, we'll talk about that for sure.
[569.12 → 570.16] After the intro, though.
[570.50 → 570.88] Bye.
[571.90 → 572.46] Temporarily.
[572.46 → 574.30] It's true.
[574.48 → 574.66] No.
[575.94 → 578.18] I can't see the analytics.
[592.08 → 593.22] Comic Garage.
[595.02 → 596.02] Square Space.
[597.36 → 598.06] PIA.
[598.54 → 599.20] Are we live on Twitch?
[599.54 → 599.72] Yeah.
[601.06 → 601.54] Not YouTube.
[602.42 → 602.92] I just tried.
[603.12 → 603.50] It's not there.
[604.40 → 605.18] We're whispering.
[605.46 → 606.16] That's pretty neat.
[606.68 → 606.86] Yeah.
[607.62 → 607.84] Huh.
[607.90 → 608.44] That's weird.
[608.86 → 612.10] How is the stream on Twitch and Flow plane, guys?
[612.10 → 612.32] Yeah.
[612.40 → 617.68] We're, uh, so on YouTube, it says video output low, and it says we're live, but it says the
[617.68 → 620.24] stream health is, oh, Lord, it's set to unlisted.
[620.38 → 621.94] Well, we'll go ahead and set that live now.
[622.50 → 623.02] Header.
[623.10 → 623.48] All right.
[624.50 → 627.26] So why don't we move right into the-
[627.26 → 627.76] That's my bad.
[627.76 → 630.16] The big thing that happened this week.
[630.24 → 634.24] I mean, obviously, a lot of you guys watching out there would have already watched our review
[634.24 → 635.42] of the 3950X.
[635.50 → 637.28] Did you watch our review of the 3950X?
[637.28 → 637.48] No.
[637.68 → 638.66] You need an upgrade, dude.
[638.90 → 639.24] Yeah.
[639.38 → 640.78] Yeah, it's like-
[640.78 → 642.74] I can't play-
[642.74 → 643.22] It's great.
[643.30 → 645.64] I can't play the new COD and stream it the same time.
[645.64 → 646.44] No, you can't.
[646.64 → 648.50] Not without a 3950X, you can't.
[648.50 → 652.66] Well, I don't know if I necessarily need that, but I can't with my current processor.
[652.66 → 654.46] It's only $1,000 for a CPU.
[654.46 → 654.98] Oh, my God.
[654.98 → 655.34] Canadian.
[655.48 → 655.86] Canadian.
[656.34 → 657.14] $750 US.
[657.14 → 657.94] I don't want to spend that much.
[657.94 → 663.20] And that's assuming you can find one, because these things are going to be moving like hotcakes.
[663.44 → 668.22] It is so fast that it keeps up with Intel in lightly threaded, like single threaded gaming
[668.22 → 672.54] situations, and it's got 16 cores.
[673.38 → 674.68] It has 16 cores.
[674.98 → 681.56] And the thing is, it's funny, because compared to other parts of AMD's lineup, it actually doesn't
[681.56 → 682.80] look like a great value.
[682.80 → 688.90] So compared to the 3900X, although again, that's assuming that you can even find the thing in
[688.90 → 689.32] stock.
[689.32 → 693.14] Here, let's go ahead and 3900X.
[693.14 → 695.86] I think that's around $500.
[695.86 → 695.90] I think that's around $500.
[695.90 → 696.78] Yeah.
[696.78 → 700.38] So $530, assuming you can find stock of it.
[701.64 → 706.24] You know, the 3950X doesn't look like a great deal, because it's like another $250.
[706.24 → 710.12] Like you're paying another 50% more for just 30% more cores.
[710.36 → 710.58] Right.
[710.70 → 714.08] So you could look at the thing, and you could go, oh, well, this thing sucks.
[714.20 → 715.08] It's a bad bargain.
[715.56 → 721.86] But then when you compare it to Intel's lineup, so let's go grab, you know, let's grab Intel's
[721.86 → 725.56] flagship consumer CPU, the 9900KS Special Edition.
[726.16 → 726.34] What?
[726.60 → 727.66] That thing's not $1,000.
[728.00 → 728.56] What do we even...
[728.56 → 729.24] Oh, forget it.
[730.50 → 730.94] Amazon?
[731.28 → 731.50] Yeah.
[731.74 → 732.08] I don't know.
[732.52 → 732.90] Okay.
[733.00 → 734.18] So let's look at the 9900K.
[734.68 → 735.06] $480.
[735.58 → 736.94] Well, that one's only got eight cores.
[738.12 → 745.20] So now all of a sudden, if you compare AMD's top of the line to Intel's stuff, it looks like
[745.20 → 746.30] a downright bargain.
[747.56 → 748.24] 581 for the KS.
[748.34 → 749.92] 581 for the KS on Amazon.
[750.46 → 751.86] New egg was Deeping.
[751.94 → 754.14] They must just be out of stock and not want people to order it or something.
[754.14 → 756.80] Maybe they don't know when their next allocation is coming or something like that.
[757.26 → 759.68] But like, that's incredible.
[760.26 → 760.50] Yeah.
[761.16 → 766.06] Like when you have a flagship grade product, and it still looks like a bargain compared
[766.06 → 766.90] to your competitor.
[767.06 → 770.36] Mind you, that's their competitor's, you know, flagship product or whatever.
[770.44 → 775.56] But even if we look at like a 9700K or something like that, like that's more like what people
[775.56 → 776.42] actually buy.
[776.76 → 782.92] So that's, you know, eight cores without multi-threading or hyper-threading, excuse me, as
[782.92 → 784.54] Intel code, without SMT.
[784.76 → 784.96] Okay.
[785.34 → 789.84] So that's eight cores for 319 bucks, but they're slower cores.
[790.34 → 790.60] Yeah.
[792.48 → 794.12] And no SMT.
[795.00 → 800.66] So like 3950X looks like a, like a, like an almost, you know, linear price to performance
[800.66 → 802.22] increase depending on what you're doing.
[802.22 → 806.30] So there are a lot of things that aren't going to benefit from having 16 cores in a desktop.
[806.30 → 809.42] And there are a lot of things that do benefit from multicore.
[809.42 → 809.92] A ton of things.
[810.04 → 810.76] From multiple cores.
[810.86 → 814.68] Like if you wanted to run a bunch of VMs or something where dual channel memory might
[814.68 → 818.02] end up actually being a problem or running out of PCI Express lanes.
[818.10 → 820.68] Because if you've got all these VMs running, you might want to pass through devices.
[820.90 → 822.90] You might actually have a lot of things plugged in.
[822.90 → 830.16] But for the like the light workstation, you know, the, the, the, the Uber workstation
[830.16 → 831.10] light edition.
[831.28 → 831.70] Yeah.
[832.32 → 833.48] This thing looks incredible.
[833.48 → 834.88] And it games like a beast.
[835.12 → 835.38] Yeah.
[836.10 → 838.02] So I am pretty excited about that.
[838.10 → 839.58] That wasn't really in my notes.
[839.64 → 844.02] I was just kind of, this is an extension of how happy I was in my review.
[844.16 → 849.00] Unlike the flip of the coin that I'll bring up is my processor would be very expensive, but
[849.00 → 855.58] it is also five generations old and if I wasn't streaming, it has no problem with the new
[855.58 → 856.84] COD or anything else.
[856.94 → 857.32] So yes.
[857.32 → 863.84] And my dad has a processor that is seven generations old and wasn't way too expensive when it came
[863.84 → 864.04] out.
[864.18 → 867.96] Actually, no, that's not true because he got an upgrade from, from you for doing the plumbing
[867.96 → 868.26] thing.
[868.34 → 869.96] So he's still running that processor.
[870.08 → 870.52] Okay.
[870.64 → 871.24] That was a while ago.
[871.30 → 873.28] And that's still usually just fine.
[873.48 → 873.84] Yeah.
[874.00 → 874.40] Okay.
[875.48 → 875.80] Um.
[875.80 → 878.98] That's, it's not, he doesn't play the most pushing games, but it's not, it's not,
[878.98 → 880.52] it's, he doesn't have any problems with it.
[880.52 → 886.66] So that is an argument that you can make is that while AMD has certainly made great strides.
[886.86 → 887.08] Yeah.
[887.26 → 891.92] A lot of what they did was make up for sitting on their butts for, you know, the better part
[891.92 → 892.92] of a decade.
[892.92 → 902.88] Um, but what's really cool is that Dr. Sue has, I mean, I don't want to use the word
[902.88 → 907.94] confirmed because CEOs have definitely made promises and not managed to deliver on them
[907.94 → 915.42] in the past, but has said that the next generation of Ry zen is going to come out next year.
[915.68 → 915.88] Yeah.
[915.90 → 917.16] And like first half of the year.
[917.32 → 917.54] Yeah.
[917.58 → 923.70] So not only have they made up for that decade of thumb sitting, they are like still going,
[923.82 → 926.98] if I'm at Intel right now, I'm like, I'm not freaking out.
[927.04 → 932.52] The thing you guys got to understand Intel's just multi, just giant multi-billion dollar company.
[932.52 → 941.50] And even if Intel's performance was half of AMD's, I don't think AMD has the fab capacity
[941.50 → 945.50] even to supply the entire computer industry with processors.
[946.08 → 955.08] So like Intel will have customers for a long time, no matter what, because AMD is relying
[955.08 → 957.26] not only just on a third party.
[957.76 → 960.48] So they're relying on TSMC to make their processors.
[961.04 → 966.40] So it's not just that, but also the fact that TSMC like has other customers.
[967.36 → 972.24] So they're not in control of their destiny and their destiny is definitely not to have
[972.24 → 974.02] 100% of TSMC's output.
[974.52 → 981.26] So Intel's fab output, just from like a sheer, if you stop thinking about CPUs from like a
[981.26 → 983.58] passionate, enthusiast perspective.
[983.72 → 987.62] And if you think about them as the commodities that they are for most people, if we're being
[987.62 → 996.06] honest, at the end of the day, if there's only so much rubber on earth, you know, tire
[996.06 → 1002.64] manufacturer B is always going to have customers to sell to as long as the earth's demand for
[1002.64 → 1007.36] rubber exceeds the supply that tire manufacturer A can output, period.
[1007.36 → 1012.36] So it's not like Intel's in danger of going out of business or anything like that.
[1012.66 → 1018.42] But if I'm in the enthusiast division there, for example, I'm real upset because I'm going
[1018.42 → 1022.16] to start seeing, you know, my quarterly sales bonuses drop and stuff like that.
[1022.22 → 1028.22] I mean, that's one of the ways that a company as large as Intel manages to sort of not lose
[1028.22 → 1033.66] track of where their targets and where their goals are from like an individual business
[1033.66 → 1039.96] unit perspective is making sure that there's a carrot and a stick at sort of every different
[1039.96 → 1044.48] level, whether it's data centre or consumer or enthusiast or whatever the case may be.
[1044.66 → 1044.72] Yeah.
[1045.88 → 1050.54] Speaking of the sort of the bigger chips, one of the big leaks this week was, of course,
[1051.00 → 1058.90] MSI accidentally confirming the existence of a Thread ripper 3990X with 64 cores and 128 threads.
[1058.90 → 1062.06] Now, this was rumoured already.
[1062.56 → 1067.58] And then I had kind of wondered if they were going to do it because they launched the 24
[1067.58 → 1076.00] core and the 32 core, which from my perspective, were already so much stronger than the 16 core
[1076.00 → 1080.54] on the AM4 platform that they could have carried that platform on their own.
[1080.62 → 1085.68] I mean, from working at retail, or not at retail, because that implies I was like a salesperson
[1085.68 → 1087.92] on the floor, which I was, but this is not what I'm talking about.
[1088.20 → 1092.74] But working at a retailer in the product management side of things, what I can tell you guys is
[1092.74 → 1101.04] that, you know, if Intel or AMD launches a platform, so here's your motherboard, you know,
[1101.50 → 1106.00] good, better, best from Asus, MSI, Gigabyte, As rock, blah, blah, blah, etc.
[1106.00 → 1110.90] And then here's this whole stack of processors, you know, like six different CPUs.
[1111.88 → 1116.20] 50% of the sales are usually like two boards.
[1116.78 → 1122.58] So whatever the standard ATX, like, decent one is from, you know, the vendor that's doing
[1122.58 → 1126.52] really well this generation, and then like the similar one from like one of the other
[1126.52 → 1126.84] vendors.
[1127.22 → 1131.46] And then your next one is going to be like a really solid board that's like MATE or
[1131.46 → 1132.38] something like that.
[1133.04 → 1135.72] And then the rest is like everything else is kind of like dregs.
[1135.86 → 1137.84] And it's the same over on the CPU side.
[1137.84 → 1145.52] There's one or two that clearly outsell everything else and are like 50 to 80% of the total sales
[1145.52 → 1146.84] for that entire platform.
[1147.36 → 1149.20] And then there's like everything else.
[1149.34 → 1153.38] So they build out this whole product stack in order to make sure that they are meeting
[1153.38 → 1154.80] the needs of a variety of customers.
[1154.92 → 1159.68] And then they balance which ones they're actually delivering to the market based on consumer
[1159.68 → 1164.92] feedback by intentionally, in a lot of cases, intentionally crippling chips that could have
[1164.92 → 1168.06] been something better and selling them as something lesser.
[1168.24 → 1172.34] And then, of course, that's where core unlocking and overclocking and like, you know, in graphics
[1172.34 → 1175.78] cards, you know, firmware flashing cards, for example, that's where all that comes from.
[1175.78 → 1176.38] Turning them into other cards.
[1176.40 → 1180.28] Because back down to treating it like a commodity, which is what all these companies are doing
[1180.28 → 1185.88] at the thousand-foot level, you might think as a consumer, well, that's crazy.
[1185.88 → 1192.70] Why would AMD take a graphics card that they could sell as a Vega 64 or a CPU that they
[1192.70 → 1195.04] could sell as a 3950X?
[1195.20 → 1198.46] So these are both, you know, top tier, fully enabled chips.
[1199.04 → 1203.16] Why would they sell them as a 3900X with only 12 core?
[1203.26 → 1204.48] So you got four and four disabled.
[1205.04 → 1208.78] And then a Vega 56 with some of the functional units disabled.
[1208.98 → 1209.86] Why on earth would they do that?
[1209.94 → 1212.64] Surely they could get more money selling them like for that much.
[1212.64 → 1214.66] It's like, yeah, but there's a limit.
[1215.04 → 1217.38] There's a limit to the customers who are going to buy this.
[1217.54 → 1221.32] And you're better off capturing this customer than ignoring this customer.
[1221.98 → 1226.52] And so a lot of the time, the costs of a particular item end up blended, right?
[1226.66 → 1231.06] So they subsidize the cost of this one with like the extra money that they're making on
[1231.06 → 1231.68] this one.
[1231.78 → 1235.50] And as long as they're maintaining overall profitability, and they're doing a good job of
[1235.50 → 1239.54] maintaining their product stack in a way that kind of makes sense for consumers and
[1239.54 → 1241.82] retailers, then, hey, it's all hunky-dory.
[1241.82 → 1248.86] It doesn't matter if they're only making 5% on this one, but making 28% on this one,
[1248.92 → 1253.58] as long as for all the Vegas or all the Dozens they're selling, they're making an average
[1253.58 → 1255.90] of, you know, like 15, 20 points or whatever the case may be.
[1256.94 → 1260.28] Probably more than that now that people actually want their chips, which is pretty cool.
[1260.54 → 1264.36] So I'm potentially thinking of upgrading next.
[1265.76 → 1268.00] I've been thinking about doing this system for a while.
[1268.24 → 1269.68] You're going to end up going A and D, aren't you?
[1269.68 → 1270.30] Which I think...
[1270.30 → 1273.30] You're going to expect me to get a system for you and make a video about it, aren't you?
[1273.40 → 1273.64] Yeah.
[1273.78 → 1274.72] Yeah, I kind of figured that was kind of...
[1274.72 → 1274.78] Yeah.
[1274.78 → 1279.82] So I'm kind of thinking of sort of making like the...
[1279.82 → 1281.82] A few years ago, this would be a really weird computer.
[1283.26 → 1287.12] And I'm thinking of trying to wait until Intel drops a GPU.
[1288.16 → 1290.42] And then going AMD CPU, Intel GPU.
[1290.80 → 1292.20] The unthinkable computer.
[1293.56 → 1294.40] How interesting.
[1294.60 → 1295.64] I think it could be kind of cool.
[1295.88 → 1296.70] I kind of like it.
[1296.76 → 1296.92] Yeah.
[1296.92 → 1298.96] I don't know if you can wait that long.
[1299.26 → 1301.28] Because you like game stream three times a week.
[1301.48 → 1304.48] And you've been playing nothing but COD as far as I can tell, you boring guy.
[1304.48 → 1305.90] I haven't for like a long time.
[1306.14 → 1310.38] Because I like drank an insane amount of water before I came here.
[1310.50 → 1311.06] And all this kind of stuff.
[1311.08 → 1311.88] Because I'm trying to not cough.
[1311.94 → 1313.02] I've been sick for like ever.
[1313.32 → 1313.48] Yeah.
[1313.48 → 1316.44] So I've been basically not streaming for a very long time.
[1317.36 → 1318.24] But yeah.
[1318.54 → 1319.60] It's generally COD.
[1319.72 → 1320.24] You will.
[1320.56 → 1320.76] Yeah.
[1320.76 → 1323.64] And then when it's time to stream, you can't.
[1323.74 → 1323.92] Yeah.
[1324.36 → 1324.76] Yeah.
[1326.76 → 1327.58] And he's dead.
[1327.74 → 1327.98] Great.
[1328.48 → 1328.88] Yeah.
[1328.98 → 1329.52] So yeah.
[1329.64 → 1330.74] It is a bit of a problem.
[1330.92 → 1331.60] But I don't know.
[1332.76 → 1334.04] I don't want to upgrade right now.
[1334.10 → 1334.58] So we'll see.
[1335.72 → 1336.12] Okay.
[1336.32 → 1340.20] The NZ gesture, excuse me, brings up a perfect point.
[1340.98 → 1347.58] Sometimes those components of the GPU or those cores on the CPU or some of the cache, for example,
[1348.22 → 1349.98] is actually defective.
[1349.98 → 1356.76] Or sometimes it works, but it doesn't meet the thermal or power consumption targets or
[1356.76 → 1359.96] whatever the case may be or the voltage targets.
[1360.32 → 1362.62] And that is why it ends up being a lower tier processor.
[1363.08 → 1364.70] You are 100% right.
[1365.34 → 1373.02] And if the company plays their cards perfectly, then they will have exactly the defect rate
[1373.02 → 1378.56] and exactly the pricing strategy that makes it so that the demand for those products exactly
[1378.56 → 1381.72] meets the defect rate and everything is perfectly balanced.
[1381.80 → 1387.68] But in the real world, what they usually end up doing is erring on the side of disabling
[1387.68 → 1391.72] good ones in order to make sure that they're meeting the market demand and trying to build
[1391.72 → 1397.36] as many good ones as they can versus building a strategy around them mostly being defective.
[1397.50 → 1397.62] Yeah.
[1398.50 → 1403.82] They're like, you're never going to get the exact perfect yields for the structure and product stack
[1403.82 → 1404.48] that you want to have.
[1404.62 → 1404.74] Yeah.
[1405.00 → 1405.50] And especially...
[1405.50 → 1406.58] So they're going to manipulate it a little bit.
[1406.58 → 1407.86] Especially as time goes on.
[1407.92 → 1413.44] Like, don't imagine for a second that once, you know, AMD designs the 3950X, they're just like,
[1413.66 → 1416.50] okay, well, good job, everyone.
[1416.92 → 1417.36] Ha ha!
[1418.62 → 1423.50] All the time, they are constantly tweaking and tuning and trying to get those yields up.
[1423.54 → 1429.64] Because the thing is, on a silicon wafer, the more usable chips they get, the less waste
[1429.64 → 1431.80] and the more profit they can get from that wafer.
[1431.92 → 1432.54] It costs...
[1432.54 → 1434.58] I'm not going to say exactly the same amount.
[1434.58 → 1439.46] But it costs what it costs for each wafer, regardless of how many chips they get.
[1439.84 → 1441.50] So if you look at...
[1441.50 → 1447.46] I mean, a very extreme example of this would be something like a RED camera, where on a
[1447.46 → 1451.58] manufacturing wafer, they're going to get, you know, however many sensors.
[1452.26 → 1456.34] But it might take them, and I don't know what their yields are like.
[1456.42 → 1457.02] And you know what?
[1457.06 → 1460.30] For all we know, every single one of them is good, and they're just marking them up because
[1460.30 → 1461.00] ha ha!
[1461.74 → 1462.90] You know, you'll like that.
[1462.90 → 1463.20] Ha ha!
[1463.50 → 1463.86] Capitalism!
[1463.96 → 1464.18] Yeah.
[1464.18 → 1465.06] Or whatever.
[1465.64 → 1471.90] But odds are that cameras, for example, are so expensive because the tolerance to defects
[1471.90 → 1477.50] is so low, because you can't have a dead pixel on a $20,000, $30,000, $50,000 camera.
[1478.00 → 1482.24] So the tolerance to defects is so low, and therefore the yields are so low that they might have to do
[1482.24 → 1485.04] multiple runs before they get a working freaking sensor.
[1485.04 → 1492.58] And so that's why a chip can cost anywhere from cents, you know, for something where you can put
[1492.76 → 1495.00] hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of them on a wafer.
[1495.00 → 1497.46] You know, something like a motherboard chipset.
[1497.46 → 1499.24] Or like all going to come out just fine.
[1499.24 → 1499.48] Yeah.
[1499.48 → 1500.62] Because their tolerances are huge.
[1500.62 → 1504.12] Like a Bluetooth chipset or something stupid like that.
[1504.12 → 1504.56] Yeah.
[1504.56 → 1511.34] Down to something that is, you know, enormous, like NVIDIA's top-tier Turing GPU.
[1511.58 → 1514.10] That thing is freaking huge.
[1514.10 → 1519.02] So you can get a chip that's like, it's all fundamentally sort of similar.
[1519.02 → 1520.10] It's a microprocessor.
[1520.34 → 1526.30] But that costs anywhere from pennies all the way up to hundreds and hundreds or thousands of dollars
[1526.30 → 1530.22] when they're all made out of fundamentally the same thing.
[1530.30 → 1531.88] They're all just made out of glass, right?
[1535.00 → 1535.74] All right.
[1535.96 → 1538.06] Why don't we move on to our next topic here, shall we?
[1538.06 → 1539.38] Oh my God, it's flipped around.
[1539.66 → 1541.52] Someone in the Twitch chat just called me Alex.
[1542.24 → 1542.82] Oh, wow.
[1543.38 → 1544.78] No, this is not Alex.
[1544.96 → 1545.82] This is Luke.
[1546.24 → 1550.76] You can tell from his slightly, um, hmm.
[1551.00 → 1551.20] Wow.
[1551.34 → 1551.94] How can you tell?
[1552.48 → 1553.40] Both blue-eyed.
[1553.54 → 1555.10] Both got kind of floppy hair.
[1555.90 → 1557.30] Both kind of blondish.
[1557.42 → 1558.26] Both facial hair.
[1558.38 → 1559.80] Ah, Luke's facial hair is darker.
[1560.24 → 1560.42] Oh.
[1560.56 → 1561.52] Well, that'll be your cue.
[1561.78 → 1561.96] Oh.
[1565.16 → 1565.60] Apple.
[1566.14 → 1567.02] They finally did it.
[1567.02 → 1570.84] They launched a 16-inch MacBook Pro with a new keyboard.
[1571.26 → 1572.40] That's actually the old one.
[1572.48 → 1575.80] That's actually closer to the old keyboard than it is to the new keyboard.
[1576.58 → 1577.98] Um, all right.
[1578.12 → 1582.70] So, Apple, Apple's just like, I don't get it.
[1582.84 → 1585.84] Apple saw the Sonic redesign and was like, we can do this too.
[1586.96 → 1589.18] We can go back to what it was supposed to be.
[1589.88 → 1591.48] I actually haven't seen that yet.
[1591.56 → 1592.48] I do need to look at it.
[1592.58 → 1593.26] Oh, it's way better.
[1593.36 → 1593.86] Yeah, okay.
[1594.00 → 1594.58] Oh, it's...
[1594.58 → 1596.04] That freaky, weird thing was...
[1596.04 → 1596.88] Astronomically better.
[1596.88 → 1597.90] Super freaky weird.
[1597.90 → 1598.00] Yeah.
[1598.00 → 1599.18] Um, all right.
[1599.24 → 1601.10] Anyway, anyway, back to Apple launching.
[1601.24 → 1604.98] So, they did this weird thing that they do every once in a while where even though they
[1604.98 → 1611.54] actually just had an event a little while ago and then pointedly did not announce a 16-inch
[1611.54 → 1615.14] MacBook Pro when everyone was kind of expecting it, they just like waited.
[1615.14 → 1616.14] What is it?
[1616.14 → 1616.26] A couple of weeks?
[1616.26 → 1616.86] Two or three weeks?
[1616.86 → 1617.86] And then just like...
[1617.86 → 1619.40] Did it anyway?
[1619.40 → 1623.42] Just quietly put it up on their website and were like, yep.
[1623.72 → 1623.98] There it is.
[1623.98 → 1624.54] So it was a new computer.
[1625.36 → 1625.86] I...
[1625.86 → 1627.10] Okay.
[1627.10 → 1631.82] Am I being unreasonable when I say that really makes me mad?
[1632.50 → 1635.74] Because they would never launch an iPhone like that.
[1635.74 → 1641.48] Why is the Mac such a second-class citizen?
[1642.76 → 1643.44] That's fair.
[1644.14 → 1647.26] Um, I think in a way they knew this would happen.
[1648.40 → 1649.22] What would happen?
[1649.48 → 1652.04] I didn't need to raise my fingers, so people can see I'm pointing at the laptop.
[1652.14 → 1652.60] Oh, sorry.
[1652.60 → 1653.48] Um, no, it's fine.
[1653.50 → 1653.74] It's fine.
[1653.92 → 1654.46] Yeah, there you go.
[1654.64 → 1657.24] Um, just there would be articles made about it.
[1657.30 → 1658.30] We would talk about it here.
[1658.70 → 1659.66] Reviewers are going to jump on it.
[1659.68 → 1661.24] Like, it's not going to launch silently.
[1661.42 → 1663.04] Why not launch an iPhone like that then?
[1665.52 → 1666.72] That's exactly my point.
[1666.72 → 1673.46] Like, why, why, why treat certain things like they are deserving of attention and other things?
[1673.60 → 1674.26] Like, I don't know.
[1674.30 → 1675.22] Is it because...
[1675.22 → 1679.94] Maybe Apple has like an internal formula that they use to determine whether they do a big launch event
[1679.94 → 1681.22] or whether they...
[1681.22 → 1684.54] Because like, there was stuff launched at their event that was more boring than this.
[1684.86 → 1685.30] Totally!
[1685.58 → 1686.72] And it wasn't just the iPhone.
[1686.96 → 1687.38] I know!
[1687.60 → 1687.82] Yeah.
[1688.86 → 1691.38] Well, no, no, they had a second event since the iPhone event.
[1691.38 → 1695.62] I forget what they even launched because it was utterly uninteresting.
[1696.50 → 1697.12] I don't remember either.
[1697.50 → 1698.26] Why can't I...
[1698.26 → 1698.76] Oh, AirPods.
[1698.88 → 1700.22] AirPods Pro launched.
[1700.90 → 1702.54] Okay, they're perfect.
[1702.76 → 1704.98] Okay, but they could have just bundled it with this.
[1706.32 → 1708.38] Yes, but that's my point is they could have easily...
[1708.38 → 1709.46] We have multiple announcements.
[1709.98 → 1711.16] Like, here's the thing, guys.
[1711.22 → 1714.96] I mean, they're working on something like a new MacBook Pro for many, many moons.
[1715.18 → 1715.70] Many moons.
[1717.64 → 1724.42] It's not like it was a surprise to them that like two weeks from now that this is going to be launching.
[1724.54 → 1727.96] It's not like they were like, oh, are we going to launch this or are we not?
[1727.96 → 1730.08] Like when they're that close to release.
[1730.08 → 1732.16] When they can actually put it up on the website.
[1732.32 → 1734.88] They could have easily said, okay, availability in two weeks.
[1734.88 → 1745.80] So, anyway, it just outright replaces the 15-inch model in Apple's lineup because basically it's just like less bezel, which is sweet.
[1746.14 → 1746.34] Cool.
[1746.34 → 1751.44] It replaces the justifiably hated butterfly key switch design with their old scissor design.
[1751.44 → 1754.04] That's also found in the desktop magic keyboard.
[1754.18 → 1755.32] Which was good.
[1755.32 → 1756.40] They brought back the escape key.
[1756.54 → 1757.32] To be clear, like I...
[1757.32 → 1763.60] When I was more in the keyboard enthusiast community, some people used to be into those Apple desktop keyboards.
[1763.84 → 1766.00] I didn't like it, but they were into it.
[1766.44 → 1770.20] And honestly, when typing on one, I'm like, okay, this is a good experience.
[1770.28 → 1772.02] I don't prefer it, but it is a good experience.
[1772.22 → 1773.08] And then they ditched it.
[1773.14 → 1773.32] It's so...
[1773.32 → 1781.18] They added a 100-watt-hour battery, which is the maximum allowed on planes by the FAA, which gives the laptop 11 hours of battery life.
[1781.26 → 1782.52] The 15-inch had just 10.
[1782.74 → 1788.04] And you can configure it with up to 64 gigs of RAM, up to 8 terabytes of storage.
[1788.16 → 1788.62] Oh, my God.
[1788.62 → 1791.86] Up to an 8-core Core i9 CPU and a Radeon Pro 55.
[1792.28 → 1794.98] Can NVIDIA and Apple just bury the hatchet?
[1795.66 → 1797.04] Are they ever going to?
[1797.66 → 1802.02] I think if they do, it would possibly require a new CEO.
[1802.02 → 1804.52] Not at NVIDIA, because that's never going to happen.
[1805.16 → 1806.32] Well, someday it might have to.
[1806.46 → 1806.92] I guess.
[1807.56 → 1808.34] Not for a while.
[1808.34 → 1809.08] Won't live forever.
[1809.76 → 1814.66] Unless he can use GPU AI inferencing to...
[1814.66 → 1815.18] I don't know.
[1816.18 → 1816.88] Make himself...
[1816.88 → 1822.64] You know, with that leather jacket, he could be just super villain-looking enough to do it.
[1823.18 → 1823.42] Yeah.
[1824.72 → 1825.78] You should figure it out.
[1825.82 → 1827.48] I could buy Jensen as a super villain.
[1827.54 → 1827.78] Yeah.
[1827.94 → 1829.02] Yeah, I could get into that.
[1829.12 → 1830.16] I could definitely see that.
[1830.16 → 1832.54] He now, like, controls the tech in all the cars.
[1833.16 → 1835.52] So it starts at $2,400 and goes up to $6,000.
[1836.84 → 1837.24] Wow.
[1838.06 → 1838.38] Yep.
[1839.08 → 1839.98] That's a lot.
[1840.22 → 1840.70] That's...
[1840.70 → 1845.58] Honestly, with an 8 terabyte high-performance NVMe drive, that's a lot of it.
[1846.18 → 1846.72] That's fair?
[1846.80 → 1847.98] Because you've got to remember, this is not...
[1847.98 → 1850.76] I wonder how much that exact add-on costs.
[1850.90 → 1851.02] Yeah.
[1851.20 → 1853.08] Oh, it's like $2,400, I think.
[1853.08 → 1853.24] Yeah.
[1853.24 → 1855.10] Like, over top of the base model, if I ever called it.
[1855.10 → 1856.40] And, like, you don't really need that.
[1857.54 → 1858.46] I don't...
[1858.46 → 1860.62] The vast majority of people are not going to need that.
[1860.62 → 1862.06] I have a hard time imagining...
[1862.92 → 1864.44] And I know I'm going to...
[1864.44 → 1870.38] Someone's going to clip this, and they're going to, like, make me eat my words in 10 or 20 years, or whatever the case may be.
[1870.38 → 1871.76] 64 kilobytes of RAM thing?
[1871.76 → 1872.20] Yeah, sure.
[1872.20 → 1876.86] But I can't imagine a reason to have 8 terabytes of storage on a laptop.
[1877.04 → 1877.34] No.
[1879.20 → 1880.48] Maybe in the future.
[1880.68 → 1881.16] What for?
[1881.36 → 1882.02] I don't know.
[1882.50 → 1882.94] Honestly.
[1883.12 → 1883.66] But that's what...
[1883.66 → 1884.06] What for?
[1884.08 → 1885.94] That's what people would say way back.
[1886.18 → 1886.30] So...
[1886.30 → 1886.98] No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1887.00 → 1888.76] Okay, COD is 150 gigs.
[1889.26 → 1890.54] You're not playing COD on this.
[1890.66 → 1893.32] I'm just saying, file sizes increase.
[1893.72 → 1894.16] Right.
[1894.30 → 1895.12] It's a thing that happens.
[1895.38 → 1898.42] COD has gone up 3x in size in whatever amount of years.
[1898.50 → 1899.92] Which is spiffy.
[1899.92 → 1901.04] Good for you.
[1901.18 → 1906.54] Go play your COD, you sword-wielding, shotgun-firing wanker.
[1907.60 → 1909.32] But that's not what we're talking about.
[1909.42 → 1910.50] This is not a gaming device.
[1910.72 → 1911.44] I love that insult.
[1914.76 → 1915.62] Sorry, keep going.
[1916.36 → 1917.08] It's not a gaming device.
[1917.14 → 1917.46] Yeah, okay.
[1917.54 → 1921.04] But data for media is also increasing.
[1921.88 → 1922.32] Barely.
[1922.44 → 1923.64] People are going to get into 8K.
[1925.56 → 1926.16] Cold arm.
[1926.16 → 1933.74] We are at the physical limit of what you can do with a cell phone camera.
[1933.74 → 1939.78] You cannot keep putting bigger sensors in them because no one, Apple included, is willing
[1939.78 → 1941.10] to make their phones larger.
[1941.32 → 1941.48] Yeah.
[1941.62 → 1945.16] You can't pack more pixels into them because there's no benefit.
[1945.30 → 1947.70] Not because you can't keep making the lithography smaller.
[1947.90 → 1948.96] You might be able to.
[1949.18 → 1952.60] Are we currently doing simultaneous raw and not raw video?
[1952.60 → 1954.70] I know they're doing that with photo.
[1954.84 → 1955.10] Okay.
[1955.32 → 1959.64] Raw video, I guess.
[1960.02 → 1960.54] I'm just saying.
[1960.66 → 1962.40] There's like places things can go.
[1962.56 → 1965.32] But that is such a niche use case.
[1965.46 → 1970.12] And there is no reason that that file couldn't be on external storage.
[1970.98 → 1971.24] Yeah.
[1971.32 → 1971.72] Oh, yeah.
[1971.80 → 1972.92] No, I definitely agree with that part.
[1973.02 → 1976.54] I mean, Apple is literally king of the dongles.
[1976.54 → 1977.10] Yeah.
[1977.46 → 1979.48] Like storage dongle.
[1979.70 → 1985.96] There's no reason to have it internal, to have it potentially lost when your motherboard
[1985.96 → 1990.92] dies and your T2 chip makes it so that your data can't be restored.
[1991.30 → 1991.44] Yeah.
[1991.46 → 1996.16] Like that is so many eggs in a portable basket.
[1996.62 → 1999.10] I just cannot fathom it.
[1999.10 → 2003.72] And I know there's going to be digital artists out there that are like, okay, well, what about
[2003.72 → 2005.62] if I want, you know.
[2005.78 → 2006.88] I work eight hours a day.
[2006.90 → 2009.78] This entire scene and whatever else.
[2010.82 → 2013.20] Again, sure.
[2013.46 → 2014.86] I guess we can do that.
[2015.06 → 2017.02] And obviously, Apple can do it.
[2018.60 → 2020.98] For me, the magic number really was one terabyte.
[2021.88 → 2022.92] On a mobile device.
[2023.30 → 2023.50] Yeah.
[2024.16 → 2025.88] Actually, it was probably before that.
[2025.96 → 2028.58] As soon as we hit 512, I was like, yeah, I didn't really crave more.
[2028.58 → 2031.64] Because like I just brought up the argument if you work eight hours a day, like I know
[2031.64 → 2034.28] an artist that works more than eight hours a day a lot of the time.
[2034.60 → 2035.00] Yeah.
[2035.12 → 2038.20] But they do like Photoshop single image stuff.
[2038.38 → 2039.44] So theirs isn't that huge.
[2039.74 → 2039.88] Yeah.
[2039.92 → 2042.04] But even if you did video and video editing.
[2042.46 → 2042.64] Yeah.
[2042.74 → 2043.86] Oh, I'm talking more like.
[2044.00 → 2045.34] You should be offloading your stuff.
[2045.38 → 2047.86] I'm talking about more like 3D animation.
[2048.12 → 2048.60] Oh, totally.
[2048.76 → 2049.00] Yeah.
[2049.12 → 2050.16] Like digital artists.
[2050.18 → 2051.24] But you should be offloading your projects.
[2051.38 → 2053.70] Like they shouldn't live on only your laptop.
[2053.94 → 2054.78] Especially with what.
[2054.78 → 2055.24] Is I think what we're saying.
[2056.20 → 2057.08] Yes, very soon.
[2057.08 → 2059.44] Especially with what a piece of garbage finder is.
[2059.78 → 2059.92] Yeah.
[2059.92 → 2062.04] And like how hard it is to organize things.
[2062.24 → 2062.30] Yeah.
[2062.78 → 2063.66] And you can do it.
[2063.84 → 2064.66] But be honest.
[2065.00 → 2065.60] Do you?
[2066.36 → 2072.82] Because if you are doing a proper job of organizing your digital life, you probably aren't storing
[2072.82 → 2073.80] everything on your laptop.
[2074.34 → 2074.56] Yeah.
[2074.82 → 2075.04] Yeah.
[2075.34 → 2076.20] And like it's.
[2076.32 → 2077.66] Especially if it is for work.
[2077.98 → 2078.08] Yeah.
[2078.08 → 2078.28] Which is.
[2078.36 → 2080.82] I'm expecting that argument was going to come up, which is why I addressed it.
[2080.82 → 2082.10] Especially if it is for work.
[2082.30 → 2082.40] Yeah.
[2082.40 → 2084.40] Because you don't want a single point of failure.
[2084.72 → 2085.72] You want like three.
[2086.16 → 2088.28] So you should be offloading this somewhere.
[2088.40 → 2094.54] Then that somewhere should deduplicate to other places and send it all over the world.
[2094.64 → 2095.08] Oh, wow.
[2095.08 → 2095.22] Basically.
[2095.22 → 2096.52] We have a new sponsor today.
[2097.06 → 2097.42] No.
[2097.94 → 2098.40] We don't?
[2098.40 → 2100.24] We've had these guys at least one time before.
[2100.46 → 2100.72] Really?
[2100.92 → 2101.08] Yeah.
[2101.10 → 2102.12] I was excited for them to come back.
[2102.30 → 2102.74] Oh, okay.
[2102.74 → 2103.94] Maybe you weren't on the show that time.
[2103.96 → 2104.72] Oh, I must not have been.
[2104.82 → 2106.30] I think it was James and I, actually.
[2106.44 → 2107.08] Comic Garage.
[2107.38 → 2107.60] Yeah.
[2108.20 → 2111.20] Comic Garage is the monthly comic book service.
[2111.60 → 2115.76] You can choose your favourite characters and the Comic Garage will curate a personalized
[2115.76 → 2116.94] box around your selection.
[2116.94 → 2123.98] You will receive 10 curated comics in their monthly super box or 24 curated comics in their
[2123.98 → 2124.66] ultimate box.
[2124.96 → 2128.00] And you can even purchase character only boxes if you prefer.
[2128.40 → 2129.16] Yeah.
[2129.48 → 2130.60] And they're like legit.
[2130.78 → 2133.98] I wonder what kind of preferences they assume that I have here.
[2134.16 → 2134.42] I am.
[2134.92 → 2140.78] One thing I liked as well is a lot of comic book people like the quality of their comic
[2140.78 → 2142.14] books to be nice and pristine.
[2142.14 → 2147.16] And they do the actually nice cardboard box with bubble wrap, with wrap around that,
[2147.46 → 2148.46] with cardboard inserts.
[2148.56 → 2150.74] Because these blue things are just like protector covers.
[2150.98 → 2151.24] Right.
[2151.68 → 2152.18] There you go.
[2152.38 → 2154.30] So I think that's pretty cool.
[2154.54 → 2154.84] Okay.
[2154.98 → 2156.00] So what have we.
[2156.64 → 2157.66] More protectors.
[2157.66 → 2158.68] So what do we get here?
[2158.74 → 2160.34] I think they're all like face in.
[2160.52 → 2160.76] Nope.
[2161.08 → 2161.90] Half of them are one way.
[2161.96 → 2162.88] Half of them are the other way.
[2163.16 → 2164.80] Because otherwise one end would be bulgy.
[2164.98 → 2165.16] Yeah.
[2165.60 → 2166.50] So we've got.
[2167.14 → 2167.70] Oh wow.
[2167.80 → 2168.54] So these are like.
[2168.82 → 2169.08] Oh no.
[2169.08 → 2171.46] This is not just like random comics that they made.
[2171.66 → 2171.78] No.
[2171.78 → 2172.22] Okay.
[2172.22 → 2173.44] So we've got daredevil.
[2174.24 → 2175.30] Fantastic four.
[2176.10 → 2177.28] Hulk Wolverine.
[2177.44 → 2178.14] Batman, Robin.
[2178.28 → 2178.76] Two different ones.
[2179.84 → 2180.24] Wow.
[2181.00 → 2181.44] That's.
[2181.58 → 2182.62] That's pretty cool.
[2183.58 → 2184.06] Catwoman.
[2184.38 → 2185.50] Buffy the vampire slayer.
[2185.96 → 2187.12] I don't know this one.
[2187.20 → 2188.12] But JLA.
[2188.30 → 2189.14] Paradise Lost.
[2189.14 → 2190.30] You know it's funny.
[2190.56 → 2190.90] The Spectre.
[2190.94 → 2192.68] With all the Marvel movies and stuff.
[2193.16 → 2193.58] It's like.
[2194.08 → 2198.66] I feel like a lot of people think that all of a sudden that they're like a Marvel enthusiast.
[2199.00 → 2206.30] When the reality of it is that the lore and the universe and everything goes so deep.
[2206.56 → 2206.82] Yeah.
[2206.92 → 2210.42] Like decades and decades of deep.
[2210.42 → 2211.44] Just writing hard.
[2211.64 → 2211.86] Yeah.
[2212.18 → 2213.08] Multiple universes.
[2213.32 → 2214.10] All this other kind of stuff.
[2214.10 → 2215.46] So guys check it out.
[2215.60 → 2219.14] Use offer code Linus to get six dollars off your first box today.
[2219.20 → 2220.44] And it doesn't have to be for you.
[2220.52 → 2221.90] If you know someone who enjoys comics.
[2222.02 → 2225.28] Comic Garage makes a fantastic gift this holiday season.
[2225.66 → 2228.64] One of the things we've been trying to do with our kids is got them more into reading.
[2228.92 → 2230.52] And it's hilarious.
[2230.76 → 2236.94] I was talking to an educator who I happen to know is an extraordinarily conservative person.
[2236.94 → 2241.86] To the point where they would have concerns about kids reading books about Halloween.
[2242.04 → 2242.44] Harry Potter.
[2242.52 → 2242.64] Yeah.
[2242.74 → 2242.86] Okay.
[2243.04 → 2243.20] Yeah.
[2243.30 → 2243.64] No, no.
[2243.64 → 2244.12] No, no.
[2244.18 → 2244.94] Not Harry Potter.
[2245.04 → 2245.86] I'm talking Halloween.
[2246.04 → 2246.28] All right.
[2246.30 → 2249.24] Like Halloween themed Bernstein Bears book is like.
[2250.90 → 2255.64] But what they said in the newsletter was like, look, whatever I might think about, whatever.
[2256.12 → 2260.34] The best book to get your child to read is one that they will read.
[2260.54 → 2261.02] That's a cool.
[2261.18 → 2261.64] That's a good.
[2261.88 → 2262.38] That's a respect.
[2262.38 → 2266.72] And honestly, comics were a huge part of me learning to read.
[2267.14 → 2268.20] For me, it was.
[2268.52 → 2270.84] Not comic books, to be very clear.
[2270.84 → 2274.20] I'm talking like Calvin and Hobbes, Foxtrot.
[2274.20 → 2274.64] Yeah.
[2274.64 → 2275.64] Comics.
[2275.64 → 2276.28] Like funnies.
[2276.28 → 2278.48] I wasn't that into comic books.
[2278.48 → 2279.90] I don't know where Archie falls.
[2279.90 → 2280.28] Yes.
[2280.28 → 2281.54] I think that would.
[2281.54 → 2281.56] I think that would.
[2282.20 → 2285.60] Archie and Calvin and Hobbes were a pretty big thing for me.
[2285.82 → 2286.08] Yeah.
[2286.34 → 2287.80] Another huge one for me.
[2287.88 → 2289.36] Well, I mean, Harry Potter and the Hobbit.
[2289.44 → 2292.24] The Hobbit was really the one that like really projected me into my.
[2292.24 → 2294.40] So that's more of a novel adult reading.
[2294.52 → 2294.60] Right.
[2294.70 → 2294.94] Yeah.
[2295.14 → 2295.38] Yeah.
[2295.48 → 2298.84] That was the one that made me feel like, okay, I'm interested in big books now.
[2299.62 → 2299.72] Yeah.

[2350.64 → 2357.46] Oh, also, we accidentally weren't streaming on YouTube at the beginning of the show.
[2357.58 → 2357.92] My bad.
[2357.96 → 2361.10] So I should probably, no, I don't think that was your bad.
[2361.18 → 2362.80] I think it was, no, no, that was me.
[2362.92 → 2364.02] I said that last week.
[2364.20 → 2364.78] Wait, no, I didn't.
[2364.78 → 2365.86] I don't know why it was set like that.
[2365.86 → 2366.70] But I should check it.
[2366.74 → 2367.06] You know what?
[2367.18 → 2367.72] It doesn't matter.
[2367.72 → 2369.62] I think it's because we used the other thing last week.
[2369.70 → 2373.26] Buy a pack of LTT underwear, a three-pack of LTT underwear.
[2373.40 → 2374.24] I am so sorry.
[2374.34 → 2375.74] I will put a different picture there.
[2378.38 → 2379.34] That's not much better.
[2379.46 → 2379.94] Here we go.
[2380.46 → 2381.18] There we go.
[2381.22 → 2381.40] Woo.
[2381.64 → 2387.26] Buy a pack of LTT underwear and get an LTT water bottle for just 10 bucks with your order.
[2387.38 → 2389.10] So go ahead and add the underwear to your cart.
[2389.56 → 2393.42] Then the water bottle will show up for, or add both of them to your cart, and the water bottle
[2393.42 → 2395.02] will show up for $20 off.
[2395.32 → 2399.10] Actually, I think it's $9.90 because apparently discounts have to be done by percentage.
[2399.26 → 2399.92] Okay, it doesn't matter.
[2400.62 → 2401.24] All right.
[2401.56 → 2405.08] We've got time for one more topic before, we have to.
[2405.12 → 2406.18] We started the show so late.
[2406.74 → 2408.00] And we also said we were going to talk.
[2408.08 → 2409.10] 7.45 today.
[2409.22 → 2409.70] Oh, wow.
[2409.88 → 2410.20] Okay.
[2412.14 → 2413.02] Can Luke finish?
[2413.12 → 2413.78] Do you want me to do one more?
[2415.06 → 2415.46] Yes.
[2415.50 → 2416.48] I can do Project Nightingale.
[2416.48 → 2418.38] No, no, no.
[2418.48 → 2419.06] That's fine.
[2419.88 → 2420.04] Yeah.
[2420.24 → 2421.50] We really want to talk about the razor.
[2421.60 → 2422.10] You know what?
[2422.34 → 2423.56] Luke, I'll call you.
[2425.36 → 2425.76] Sweet.
[2426.08 → 2429.14] My babysitter started super early today, and I totally forgot.
[2429.50 → 2431.52] So this is going to be something a little unconventional.
[2432.40 → 2434.28] I'm going to call into my own show.
[2434.42 → 2434.68] Yeah.
[2434.88 → 2435.84] And yeah.
[2436.16 → 2436.84] This is awesome.
[2436.96 → 2437.28] Dare be.
[2440.08 → 2443.94] I'm going to check the chat to see what people think about how it sounds.
[2443.94 → 2445.74] All right.
[2445.74 → 2446.02] Cool.
[2446.72 → 2450.16] I just need to find my backpack, and then I'll call back in.
[2450.18 → 2452.34] If you want to just start Project Nightingale without me, that's cool.
[2452.68 → 2452.96] Okay.
[2453.06 → 2454.62] I just want to see what chat says real quick.
[2460.16 → 2461.92] No one's saying anything.
[2467.46 → 2468.96] So I'm not sure.
[2469.04 → 2471.40] Do we have a cardboard Linus that we can put here?
[2471.60 → 2472.16] I wish.
[2472.28 → 2473.32] We had one before.
[2473.32 → 2474.24] The waif pillow.
[2474.46 → 2474.76] Perfect.
[2475.18 → 2475.44] Okay.
[2475.94 → 2479.94] So I'm going to do Project Nightingale, I guess, before we do the razor foldable phone.
[2480.34 → 2486.02] So Project Nightingale was Google collecting the health records of 50 million Americans
[2486.02 → 2488.12] without their knowledge.
[2488.26 → 2493.62] A bombshell report by the Wall Street Journal exposed Google Project Nightingale, an initiative
[2493.62 → 2495.76] by Google to collect all of that stuff.
[2495.76 → 2502.28] The data includes names, birthdays, addresses, family members, allergies, immunizations, radiology
[2502.28 → 2507.98] scans, hospitalization records, and, you know, all the rest of everyone's complete medical
[2507.98 → 2508.42] history.
[2508.42 → 2513.84] The data was provided by St. Louis-based Ascension, one of the biggest health companies in the
[2513.84 → 2515.04] U.S. in exchange for...
[2515.04 → 2516.16] You're not even on the phone right now.
[2516.16 → 2516.72] I don't need to do that.
[2516.72 → 2524.28] In exchange for secure management of patient data and the provision of tools to improve
[2524.28 → 2526.62] clinical quality and patient safety.
[2526.62 → 2532.24] Google says the initiative is completely legal, and they are also working on similar arrangements
[2532.24 → 2536.00] with dozens of other health care providers, also known as we don't care what you think,
[2536.04 → 2536.80] we're doing it anyway.
[2538.52 → 2545.26] Furthermore, Google says patient data cannot and will not be combined with any Google consumer
[2545.26 → 2545.70] data.
[2546.84 → 2550.72] But now, the U.S. government, specifically the Office for Civil Rights in the Department
[2550.72 → 2555.54] of Health and Human Services, is investigating Project Nightingale to ensure their following
[2555.54 → 2556.16] regulations.
[2556.62 → 2558.26] This sounds terrible.
[2558.88 → 2564.66] These are the opinion notes, not the notes from the meeting, but the opinion notes that
[2564.66 → 2569.04] I don't know who they were written by, this is not my opinion, says this sounds terrible
[2569.04 → 2573.52] on paper, but maybe we need a central database of medical information.
[2573.98 → 2577.08] It's better than waiting for doctors to send files directly to each other.
[2577.42 → 2580.04] And then the next note says, what's the worst that could happen?
[2580.48 → 2585.76] In my opinion, the worst that could happen is pretty terrible because the second like insurance
[2585.76 → 2587.36] companies and stuff get a hold of this.
[2587.44 → 2591.88] They could change your insurance rates based on whatever the doctor says, and they would
[2591.88 → 2593.60] have more leeway to do that kind of stuff.
[2593.60 → 2598.74] And I mean, you know, things leak all the time and stuff.
[2598.74 → 2599.74] I mean, you know, I don't know.
[2599.74 → 2600.74] I don't know.
[2600.74 → 2601.74] I don't know.
[2601.74 → 2602.74] I don't know.
[2602.74 → 2603.74] I don't know.
[2603.74 → 2604.74] I don't know.
[2604.74 → 2605.74] I don't know.
[2605.74 → 2606.74] I don't know.
[2606.74 → 2607.74] I don't know.
[2607.74 → 2608.74] I don't know.
[2608.74 → 2609.74] I don't know.
[2609.74 → 2615.82] You know, from profiling using deep learning to, you know, getting their hands on.
[2618.78 → 2619.78] Getting their hands on what?
[2620.32 → 2621.16] Oh, there we go.
[2621.22 → 2627.54] To getting their hands on information, lifestyle, for example, in order to determine, you know,
[2627.54 → 2633.12] well, how likely it is that, you know, you're going to die or develop some condition or whatever
[2633.12 → 2633.90] the case may be.
[2633.90 → 2634.12] Right.
[2634.30 → 2634.70] Exactly.
[2634.70 → 2639.36] I mean, any excuse to squeeze you and add more to your premiums.
[2639.70 → 2645.98] This is like the DNA sequencing stuff, 23andMe or whatever it's called and all those other
[2645.98 → 2646.24] things.
[2646.70 → 2650.46] There's a big reason to not do it, which are they sell all that information.
[2651.08 → 2652.72] So your insurance premium might go up immediately.
[2653.48 → 2655.70] The worst part of that whole situation.
[2656.20 → 2661.42] So we should probably do a quick recap for people who aren't familiar with those programs.
[2661.56 → 2662.74] Do you want to talk people through it?
[2662.74 → 2665.44] I actually don't know it super well.
[2665.54 → 2668.60] All I know is that they do definitely sell that information.
[2669.00 → 2672.24] No, I just mean the basics, like what those DNA testers are.
[2673.08 → 2674.68] Oh, you like to buy this kit.
[2674.78 → 2679.60] And as far as I know, you like to spit into a vial thing, and then you ship it off and then
[2679.60 → 2684.88] they send you information about like who you might be related to and what medical issues
[2684.88 → 2688.06] you might have and et cetera, et cetera.
[2688.06 → 2695.78] And these kits and the service are super cheap, suspiciously cheap to the point where it's
[2695.78 → 2699.98] pretty obvious that what they're doing is they're harvesting the data, and they're selling
[2699.98 → 2700.20] it.
[2700.52 → 2706.44] And the worst part is that by participating in this, you're not only putting your own
[2706.44 → 2711.42] information out there and at risk of being obtained by something you might not want to
[2711.42 → 2715.38] have it, you're also putting your family at the same risk.
[2715.38 → 2721.04] Because let's say, for example, all of my siblings for a lark went on Amazon and bought
[2721.04 → 2723.52] a kit to test their DNA and submitted it.
[2723.68 → 2731.78] Now, all of a sudden, whoever buys that data can make a pretty darn good guess about me,
[2731.86 → 2735.42] even though I have never actually submitted any DNA for testing.
[2735.42 → 2736.42] Yep.
[2736.42 → 2737.42] Yep.
[2737.42 → 2738.42] Yep.
[2738.42 → 2739.42] Pretty lame.
[2739.42 → 2742.42] Sorry, give me one second.
[2742.42 → 2753.42] Yeah, so the worst that could happen is like all your stuff could get sold.
[2753.42 → 2759.10] I'm not necessarily against a central repository of medical information, but I think if that
[2759.10 → 2761.74] happens it should be managed by the government, not Google.
[2761.74 → 2762.74] I don't know why anyone's okay with this.
[2762.74 → 2765.24] And the issue is like, how do we trust them either?
[2765.42 → 2765.92] That's true.
[2766.36 → 2773.86] It's this ridiculous situation we're in where on the one hand, you know, I'm actually applying
[2773.86 → 2775.08] for life insurance right now.
[2775.16 → 2777.80] I'm going through that process at this time.
[2778.14 → 2782.80] And it was like, I also happen to be changing my family doctor right now.
[2782.80 → 2789.20] And it was just baffling to me that one doctor's office had no way of getting my medical
[2789.20 → 2792.02] records from another one without it being faxed to them.
[2792.02 → 2794.08] I'm like, what year is it?
[2794.08 → 2794.96] It's 1986.
[2794.96 → 2799.00] Like, what is going on here?
[2799.00 → 2804.72] But the flip side of it is that, no, in fact, this information is not available because if
[2804.72 → 2806.92] we stored it all online, then someone would take it.
[2807.58 → 2807.68] Yeah.
[2809.64 → 2810.98] Yep, that's very true.
[2811.90 → 2816.62] I don't know necessarily what they need to do, but this doesn't seem like it.
[2816.62 → 2818.26] A new internet.
[2818.84 → 2819.12] Okay?
[2819.48 → 2820.48] So get this.
[2820.98 → 2826.44] New dedicated fibre runs for secured data.
[2827.60 → 2830.72] They probably have that for certain military things.
[2831.04 → 2831.84] Oh, I'm sure they do.
[2832.42 → 2832.74] Yeah.
[2832.74 → 2839.92] I'm like, not just like, like, you know, I'm even, I have never specifically read about
[2839.92 → 2844.78] it or anything, but I am so certain that they do that it's, I'm not even going to guess
[2844.78 → 2845.02] at it.
[2845.08 → 2845.30] Yeah.
[2845.54 → 2845.82] Yeah.
[2846.38 → 2850.16] So like doing that for medical doesn't even seem like that much of a stretch, to be honest.
[2852.26 → 2853.42] Certainly a big enough industry.
[2853.82 → 2854.58] Yeah, exactly.
[2854.72 → 2855.72] Especially in the States.
[2856.12 → 2856.38] Okay.
[2856.46 → 2857.10] We're moving on.
[2857.18 → 2858.02] One more topic.
[2858.52 → 2859.12] Motorola Razr.
[2859.12 → 2859.78] How about the Razor?
[2859.90 → 2860.34] Exactly.
[2860.60 → 2860.78] Yep.
[2860.92 → 2862.72] Motorola Razr foldable phone unveiled.
[2862.82 → 2864.68] I'm just going to go through the notes quick, and then I'll set you loose.
[2864.76 → 2864.94] Sure.
[2865.26 → 2870.70] It's been leaked to high heck already, but Motorola unveiled its modern revamp of the
[2870.70 → 2873.16] classic Razor flip phone on Wednesday night.
[2873.24 → 2875.64] I will show it to you guys in a moment when I'm done reading the notes.
[2875.64 → 2881.46] It's got a 6.2 inch flexible display and a 2.7 inch secondary display visible when the
[2881.46 → 2882.58] phone is folded.
[2882.82 → 2884.24] So like the screen on the top.
[2884.24 → 2889.06] It's a Qualcomm Snapdragon 710, a mid-range CPU from 2018.
[2889.82 → 2895.50] 6 gigabytes of RAM, 128 gigabytes of storage, 2510 William hour battery.
[2895.84 → 2896.84] It's USB-C based.
[2897.20 → 2898.58] Android 9 Pie.
[2898.88 → 2901.44] Apparently it's going to upgrade to Oreo later.
[2901.72 → 2902.60] No specific date.
[2903.24 → 2907.66] Motorola has apparently addressed the dust and debris ingest issues.
[2907.66 → 2912.32] And it's coming January 2020 for $1,500.
[2914.02 → 2917.16] I'll show it to you guys now and let Linus go ham.
[2918.66 → 2920.18] Well, you know, okay.
[2920.78 → 2924.84] The funny thing is, is I'm not even like a foldable phone hater.
[2925.16 → 2928.80] Like I'm sure you could find people who think foldable phones are dumber than I think they
[2928.80 → 2929.02] are.
[2929.02 → 2933.86] And there are a lot of arguments to be made for why folding screen phones, particularly
[2933.86 → 2936.78] right now, just make absolutely no sense.
[2936.88 → 2942.90] Because compared to something like the latest iPhone, their water resistance, their dust
[2942.90 → 2949.78] resistance, their drop resistance, the hinge on the Galaxy Fold is starting to be a little
[2949.78 → 2951.46] bit wiggly wobbly.
[2951.54 → 2954.42] Not much, but like it's not perfect anymore.
[2954.56 → 2956.92] Like there's so much to go wrong.
[2956.92 → 2963.04] I mean, there is a reason that for the longest time, the trend in mobile devices was towards
[2963.04 → 2966.00] making them have fewer moving parts, not more.
[2966.96 → 2969.50] And fewer points of ingress, not more.
[2971.00 → 2978.02] But by and large, I really like the idea of something that it has a big screen, but then
[2978.02 → 2979.32] folds up small in my pocket.
[2979.32 → 2987.30] Where I get kind of lost on this one is that the unfolded screen isn't that big.
[2988.56 → 2989.12] Yeah.
[2989.36 → 2994.40] And I will throw them a bone here by saying that they fixed the crease issue.
[2995.78 → 2996.04] Sure.
[2996.04 → 3000.36] This video doesn't have the animation for it, but there's a different video that shows
[3000.36 → 3003.98] like a cut view of the phone unfolding.
[3004.60 → 3011.22] And the way that they manage the fold is by like, it doesn't pinch at any real point.
[3011.32 → 3013.34] It just kind of curves even more.
[3013.62 → 3015.68] So when it gets unfolded, there's no crease.
[3015.76 → 3017.12] It's a very seamless looking screen.
[3017.24 → 3019.50] I think it looks fantastic in that way.
[3019.50 → 3022.80] So I want to make sure they have that bone thrown towards them.
[3022.88 → 3027.40] But yeah, all the other folding phones, you're like massively increasing your screen real estate.
[3027.54 → 3032.66] With this one, you're going from extremely little to an acceptably normal amount.
[3033.04 → 3033.40] Right.
[3033.48 → 3043.34] Because to me, like the only reasons to change the form factor of a device are for utilitarian
[3043.34 → 3044.66] not the only reasons.
[3044.74 → 3044.82] Okay.
[3044.82 → 3045.68] How do I explain this?
[3045.68 → 3052.14] The problem with carrying around a tablet is that you have to have a bag for it.
[3052.34 → 3056.56] Whether it's a messenger bag or a backpack, it doesn't fit in your pants.
[3057.18 → 3062.24] And then when you go down to a phone, it fits in your pants.
[3062.36 → 3068.18] So it's like, for me, device classes, rather than being defined by the diagonal size of their
[3068.18 → 3071.76] screen in inches or whatever else, are defined by how you carry them.
[3072.14 → 3074.32] And that was always my problem with the iPad.
[3074.32 → 3077.50] People were pitching it as like this mobile revolution.
[3077.68 → 3083.16] And I'm like, yeah, if by mobility, you mean going upstairs and downstairs in your house.
[3083.68 → 3086.14] Like for a while, people were trying to do it.
[3086.20 → 3092.14] But it's a joke to consider an iPad something that you actually carry around with you every day.
[3092.20 → 3092.96] Just use a laptop.
[3093.52 → 3096.02] Like if you have actual work to do, you're using a laptop.
[3096.44 → 3100.98] And by the way, if you put a type cover on your iPad, it's a laptop.
[3100.98 → 3102.86] So, you know, you played yourself.
[3103.10 → 3103.60] Congratulations.
[3103.88 → 3103.98] Yeah.
[3103.98 → 3113.16] So the problem that I have with a device like this is that it makes compromises and adds cost
[3113.16 → 3117.22] without changing the class of the device.
[3117.22 → 3123.72] So what a foldable phone like the Fold or the Mate X, I'm assuming, even though I haven't had it in my hands yet, but it's a similar concept.
[3124.12 → 3132.48] What those do is they take a device that was previously too big to be carryable and make it everyday carryable.
[3132.86 → 3143.16] Whereas what this does is take a device that was already everyday carryable, even at its maximum unfolded size, and make it like a different shape everyday carryable.
[3143.16 → 3146.86] And to me, the wow factor is a thing.
[3147.46 → 3150.78] People saw the Galaxy Fold, and they were like, oh, wow, that's cool.
[3150.92 → 3154.84] Like they would strike up a conversation with me just randomly in my daily life.
[3155.08 → 3156.10] So that's something.
[3157.34 → 3162.32] But to me, that's not enough of a reason to spend $1,500 on new tier last gen hardware.
[3162.74 → 3163.50] I don't buy it.
[3164.16 → 3164.32] Yeah.
[3164.62 → 3165.04] Yeah.
[3165.22 → 3166.28] Last gen hardware.
[3166.72 → 3168.54] Not having Oreo on it yet.
[3169.26 → 3170.74] There are just some things.
[3170.86 → 3170.96] Oh, yeah.
[3170.96 → 3172.60] Last gen software too.
[3172.60 → 3173.04] Yeah.
[3173.34 → 3179.72] There are some things that just kind of seem a little weird about it that don't make me super excited.
[3179.98 → 3184.52] I actually kind of like the idea of an option for a much smaller in your pocket phone.
[3185.48 → 3185.96] Sure.
[3186.32 → 3188.04] I could see people going for that.
[3188.10 → 3191.24] I don't necessarily really care, but I could definitely see people going for that.
[3191.48 → 3200.40] But if you think about the design trends of pants, for example, is having something that's smaller in the X and Y dimensions,
[3200.40 → 3204.02] but thicker, actually easier to carry?
[3204.72 → 3205.54] Yeah, probably not.
[3205.54 → 3209.76] I would say having something slim is better for most pairs of pants, no?
[3210.00 → 3211.38] Would be for me for sure.
[3211.60 → 3214.14] I also think a big drawback is it's $1,500.
[3215.74 → 3216.18] Yeah.
[3216.18 → 3217.94] Like, it's really expensive.
[3218.20 → 3219.18] That's a lot.
[3219.66 → 3223.30] And I think there's going to be a nostalgia factor for people with just the name.
[3223.72 → 3224.20] Yeah.
[3224.22 → 3235.60] But guys, you've got to understand, this bears about as much resemblance to the original Razor as like, I don't know, how do I even compare this?
[3235.60 → 3242.08] As like, you know, a modern Ford F-150 does.
[3242.54 → 3243.40] I don't know.
[3243.66 → 3246.56] I was going to say a Durango to a Model T, but I don't.
[3246.64 → 3246.92] Sure.
[3247.08 → 3247.30] Yeah.
[3247.40 → 3247.74] Fine.
[3248.02 → 3248.38] Fine.
[3248.44 → 3249.72] I mean, that's a Dodge, but who cares?
[3249.82 → 3250.02] Yeah.
[3250.10 → 3250.56] It doesn't matter.
[3250.66 → 3254.70] The point is that, yes, they're both cellular telephones, I guess.
[3255.16 → 3259.88] But actually, yeah, the Durango example is perfect because Motorola is not even, it's owned by Motorola.
[3259.88 → 3261.14] It's not the same company anymore.
[3261.46 → 3261.50] Yeah.
[3261.50 → 3263.98] The Motorola brand is owned by Lenovo now.
[3264.08 → 3264.28] Yeah.
[3264.28 → 3268.52] So, like, it's not the same people making it.
[3268.78 → 3272.22] It's an extremely different phone in an extremely different era.
[3272.78 → 3272.96] Yeah.
[3273.02 → 3277.92] They could have called it something else, but they did this just to cash in on your nostalgia.
[3278.22 → 3287.40] And you should try to evaluate the device as it is rather than what you sort of remember it maybe having been at it something time.
[3287.82 → 3288.48] Rose coloured.
[3289.42 → 3292.58] Someone in chat said screen isn't going to get scratched in your pocket.
[3292.58 → 3294.94] I mean, it still has a screen on the one side.
[3295.02 → 3298.14] And when's the last time you had a modern phone screen get scratched in your pocket?
[3298.54 → 3302.98] Also, when's the last time you didn't buy a screen protector from D brand for, like, a few bucks?
[3303.74 → 3304.14] Yeah.
[3305.14 → 3305.50] Prism.
[3306.02 → 3306.56] Go get it.
[3307.06 → 3307.40] Yeah.
[3307.40 → 3316.00] And even if you don't buy a D brand one, you can get ones on eBay or, like, Deal Extreme or Rally Express for, like, literally, like, $3.
[3316.00 → 3325.72] The first thing I did with my Switch when I bought it was I bought a like, little tempered glass screen protector thing to throw on my Switch.
[3326.60 → 3328.66] That cost, like, almost nothing.
[3328.84 → 3332.02] And it was a pack of two just in case something happened with the first one.
[3332.02 → 3345.36] Yeah, so for the price of, like, a normal flagship phone, like a Note 10 or 10 Plus or, like, an iPhone 11 Pro or whatever, you could buy yourself a lot of screen protectors to scratch up.
[3346.86 → 3348.80] Yeah, just, like, a whole horde of them.
[3349.34 → 3350.58] And get modern hardware.
[3351.02 → 3351.24] Yeah.
[3351.24 → 3353.54] And another thing, too, like, here's another issue that I have.
[3353.60 → 3354.88] Like, who are they targeting with this?
[3354.94 → 3368.16] Like, if it's supposed to be, you know, your fashionistas, like, with the original Motorola Razr where it was, like, a super trendy phone, those people take a lot of pictures and upload them to Instagram these days.
[3368.22 → 3369.72] That wasn't as big of a deal back then.
[3370.12 → 3372.00] I can guarantee you.
[3372.30 → 3374.28] I haven't seen the phone.
[3374.52 → 3376.44] No one's seen the phone as far as I know.
[3376.44 → 3382.70] But I can guarantee you the camera on this thing sucks because Motorola hasn't made a single good mobile camera.
[3383.40 → 3396.04] And especially in a form factor like this where they're going to be more thickness constrained, I am not imagining for a second that the camera is going to somehow be, you know, a paradigm shift, quantum leap forward for them.
[3396.20 → 3398.48] So that's a huge problem to me.
[3399.22 → 3399.70] Yeah.
[3400.58 → 3401.52] It's the customer.
[3401.52 → 3410.98] Random thing that I looked up, a Pixel 3, as a newer operating system and a newer CPU, it has a little bit less memory.
[3411.20 → 3412.02] I'll give you that much.
[3412.54 → 3416.32] And I think you can buy it with the same amount of storage, but I'm not sure.
[3416.70 → 3417.42] That's $600.
[3418.58 → 3426.38] So you could buy one, and if the screen got scratched, you could just throw it away and buy another one and still save money.
[3427.14 → 3427.26] Sorry?
[3427.36 → 3428.28] Pixel 4 or Pixel 3?
[3428.28 → 3429.28] This is a Pixel 3.
[3429.80 → 3430.64] This is a Pixel 3.
[3430.74 → 3430.92] Okay.
[3430.92 → 3431.40] Yeah.
[3431.54 → 3432.10] All right, then.
[3432.74 → 3433.68] So it's one gen.
[3433.80 → 3435.24] Pixel 4 is a little bit too expensive.
[3435.60 → 3437.68] You'd still save a lot of money buying a Pixel 4.
[3438.32 → 3442.06] Yeah, but you couldn't just throw it away when, you know, you don't like the colour anymore or whatever.
[3442.28 → 3445.68] Yeah, but you could also just go to a shop and get the screen replaced for nothing.
[3446.36 → 3447.48] Yeah, well, there's that, too.
[3447.50 → 3448.58] And save a lot of money.
[3449.04 → 3453.50] So, yeah, that is not a very relevant argument, I would say.
[3453.50 → 3464.06] But I mean, the fact that we're down this rabbit hole, I think, underscores just the kind of stupidity that we're dealing with.
[3464.14 → 3464.82] I mean, I don't know.
[3464.92 → 3468.10] I might end up using the thing and being like, well, this thing is sick.
[3468.98 → 3469.58] But I doubt it.
[3469.58 → 3473.08] I feel like, I genuinely feel like flipping it open is going to feel cool.
[3474.00 → 3474.56] Oh, yeah.
[3474.66 → 3475.48] Because I used to love that.
[3475.48 → 3475.96] You're going to feel like a badass.
[3476.30 → 3476.54] Yeah.
[3477.06 → 3478.26] I used to love my flip phone.
[3478.96 → 3481.68] A badass with no money and a last-gen phone.
[3481.92 → 3482.22] Yeah.
[3482.22 → 3484.30] More than last-gen.
[3484.36 → 3484.96] That's the thing.
[3485.26 → 3487.90] Is the processor on the Pixel 3 is notably better than this.
[3487.98 → 3490.56] It's a generation beyond in Snapdragon architecture.
[3491.76 → 3492.92] Oh, that's right, too.
[3492.98 → 3494.28] And it's a high-end chip.
[3494.44 → 3494.72] Yeah.
[3495.94 → 3496.30] Woof.
[3496.52 → 3500.48] So we're mid-range and a generation behind last year's Pixel.
[3501.58 → 3502.10] All right.
[3502.32 → 3503.48] What the heck, man?
[3504.14 → 3505.62] But, yeah, I think that's it for the show.
[3505.62 → 3511.70] I'm going to cover Super Chats because this is going to be the first time that I don't forget to do them when I'm by myself.
[3513.06 → 3514.66] Are you going to hang around for Super Chats?
[3514.72 → 3515.24] Are you going to take off?
[3515.26 → 3516.52] I'd like to hear Super Chats.
[3516.66 → 3517.00] All right.
[3517.26 → 3517.86] Let's do this.
[3517.92 → 3518.36] Give me a sec.
[3520.28 → 3520.94] DA-da-da-da.
[3522.98 → 3525.32] This is so bizarre to me calling into my own show.
[3525.40 → 3525.88] Hi, hi.
[3526.38 → 3528.68] Long time, long time viewer, first time caller.
[3531.42 → 3538.86] Someone asked, is the Samsung CRG9 the best 49-inch gaming monitor?
[3538.86 → 3544.44] There are not a lot of 49-inch gaming monitors, so I'm going to go with yes.
[3544.84 → 3544.92] Sure.
[3545.36 → 3545.56] Yeah.
[3545.90 → 3550.60] With that said, if you're willing to go 55-inch, Alienware has their OLED model.
[3551.48 → 3551.74] Oh.
[3551.74 → 3554.88] Here's one that might interest you, Linus.
[3555.08 → 3558.88] Supcom risk map has been restored in the FAF vault.
[3559.52 → 3560.90] I am aware.
[3561.12 → 3562.46] So this is so cool.
[3562.46 → 3569.64] When I complained in the Tech Hoarders video about this map that I really wanted to play
[3569.64 → 3578.08] that didn't exist anymore, the original developer dusted off his code after, I think, an eight-year
[3578.08 → 3583.28] hiatus or ten-year hiatus where it wasn't working and updated it.
[3583.34 → 3585.16] That's so cool, actually.
[3585.16 → 3590.68] Yeah, so he emailed me and let me know, and so I am waiting to try it.
[3590.74 → 3593.84] I was actually kind of hoping you and I could play it on the next little bit here.
[3594.02 → 3594.32] I'm down.
[3594.34 → 3594.98] It's really cool.
[3595.20 → 3595.54] I'm down.
[3598.46 → 3602.66] A lot of people sending money from their Google Opinions rewards.
[3602.98 → 3603.40] Thank you.
[3603.50 → 3604.08] Thanks, dogs.
[3604.32 → 3604.54] Yeah.
[3606.82 → 3607.94] Hey, guys from the UK.
[3608.10 → 3609.14] Love the videos, and thanks.
[3609.62 → 3610.88] Ian Luke got me into PC building.
[3610.98 → 3611.40] That's cool.
[3611.56 → 3611.78] Yeah.
[3611.78 → 3614.02] Thanks for the content.
[3617.60 → 3620.50] Apparently, they're having issues with the Flow plane app for Android.
[3620.66 → 3622.92] There are lots of updates, actually, coming out very recently.
[3623.40 → 3625.22] They're taking a very long time to propagate.
[3625.94 → 3632.00] So, like, when we launch a new update, they don't all immediately go to your phone, and
[3632.00 → 3634.12] I'm not sure exactly how it selects it.
[3634.20 → 3640.16] It seems like it's supposed to happen in downtime, which is generally overnight, but we found that
[3640.16 → 3644.22] it's taking, like, many days to actually propagate updates to everyone.
[3644.66 → 3645.78] So, I don't know.
[3645.88 → 3649.54] But it is slowly but surely sending these updates out.
[3649.82 → 3653.52] So, eventually, hopefully, you'll get some updates that'll fix some things.
[3654.30 → 3657.78] Jayden's been hard at work fixing a lot of different bugs on the app.
[3658.40 → 3659.96] Are we going to have an iOS app at some point?
[3659.96 → 3660.46] Yeah.
[3660.46 → 3662.14] He's actually also working on that right now.
[3662.60 → 3662.84] Okay.
[3662.90 → 3663.10] Cool.
[3665.10 → 3668.44] I'm getting the Racer Core X and 2060 S.
[3668.64 → 3669.46] Opinion, please.
[3671.24 → 3671.72] Neat.
[3672.70 → 3673.60] I'm not sure.
[3674.58 → 3674.84] Yeah.
[3674.94 → 3675.42] I don't know.
[3677.70 → 3678.28] I don't know.
[3678.28 → 3681.96] It seems pretty cool if you want more graphics performance on your mobile device.
[3682.10 → 3682.30] Yeah.
[3682.70 → 3682.86] Yeah.
[3684.86 → 3685.60] Do-do-do.
[3685.60 → 3690.34] Shroud collab video when, someone's asking.
[3690.90 → 3692.38] Oh, so soon.
[3694.42 → 3696.64] Shoot, I think it's in the next week or so.
[3697.14 → 3698.64] It's been a lot of work, guys.
[3699.26 → 3700.20] But it's going to be perfect.
[3700.72 → 3704.42] Someone asked, hey, Link, I'm building a game dev PC.
[3704.62 → 3706.52] Should I wait for Black Friday slash Cyber Monday?
[3706.98 → 3708.42] Or are they likely to be out of stock?
[3708.60 → 3708.92] Blah, blah, blah.
[3709.70 → 3710.96] Short answer is absolutely.
[3711.56 → 3714.38] Also, I'm assuming Linus Tech Tips is going to have a Black Friday video?
[3715.60 → 3716.56] Probably.
[3717.22 → 3718.36] I'm assuming we will too.
[3718.66 → 3718.90] Yeah.
[3719.18 → 3720.10] I don't necessarily.
[3720.78 → 3722.08] Not always a guarantee, but yeah.
[3723.66 → 3724.16] Do-do-do.
[3729.06 → 3730.92] Sorry, I'm just skipping through some of these.
[3731.84 → 3733.96] Don't know who else to give these super chats to.
[3734.18 → 3734.50] Perfect.
[3735.20 → 3736.82] That's exactly what I want to hear.
[3736.82 → 3745.72] Hey, I was watching your 10 gig home network video.
[3746.10 → 3747.08] Congrats on the upgrade.
[3747.42 → 3750.74] Did Jake use shielded connectors on your Cat 6A cable?
[3750.98 → 3753.72] He didn't mention the grounding wire in his mini tutorial.
[3753.72 → 3758.18] No, I don't believe we did use shielded connectors.
[3760.18 → 3760.54] All right.
[3761.82 → 3765.38] Hey guys, I built my first PC and ran Ida64 stress test.
[3765.50 → 3767.90] Ry zen 5 2600 Plus stock cooler.
[3768.28 → 3771.40] PC turned off at 85 to 90 degrees Celsius.
[3771.82 → 3772.66] Is this normal?
[3772.66 → 3776.66] No, you should probably make sure that you put thermal paste on your cooler.
[3776.82 → 3777.02] Yeah.
[3777.28 → 3780.92] And make sure you don't have like the little plastic thing covering the bottom of the stock
[3780.92 → 3781.12] cooler.
[3781.26 → 3782.12] If it is there.
[3782.26 → 3784.10] I'm not sure on that one in particular.
[3785.38 → 3786.32] Uh, do-do-do-do.
[3788.00 → 3789.54] Legitimately enjoying your videos.
[3789.92 → 3792.22] Love how you've been a trailblazer turning YouTube legit.
[3792.36 → 3793.02] Respectful business.
[3793.10 → 3793.56] Keep it up.
[3793.88 → 3794.56] That was from Jordan.
[3794.66 → 3795.44] Thank you very much, Jordan.
[3795.64 → 3796.24] Thanks, Jordan.
[3796.24 → 3803.18] Would you be okay with me making a fan game of LTT for my project in my game development
[3803.18 → 3803.66] unit?
[3804.92 → 3805.12] Uni.
[3805.12 → 3810.16] As long as it's for like educational purposes only, I'm not going to object to anyone utilizing
[3810.16 → 3813.08] like, you know, our logo or our likenesses.
[3813.42 → 3817.32] As soon as you tried to commercialize it, I think we'd have a bit of a problem on our hands.
[3818.10 → 3818.28] Yeah.
[3819.38 → 3820.56] That kind of makes sense.
[3821.30 → 3824.42] And I think like try to keep the integrity of the people in it.
[3824.42 → 3827.74] If you're using people, you know.
[3827.86 → 3831.60] Um, make sure you capture Luke's full sex appeal, please.
[3831.98 → 3832.38] Perfect.
[3832.82 → 3833.06] Yeah.
[3833.22 → 3834.98] Got to get the badonkadonk in there.
[3835.40 → 3837.70] Uh, Bronson Eagle says, love you guys.
[3837.78 → 3838.48] Keep up the great work.
[3838.54 → 3839.16] Thank you very much.
[3839.74 → 3842.76] Uh, Corey says, what happened to the team face pins?
[3844.32 → 3845.06] Oh boy.
[3845.22 → 3847.54] They are all in a room.
[3847.68 → 3848.58] They're all sitting there.
[3848.84 → 3851.36] At our headquarters in little velvet boxes.
[3851.98 → 3853.90] And that is a great question for Nick.
[3853.90 → 3854.54] You know what?
[3854.88 → 3860.98] If you want to put some pressure on him, you can message the lttstore.com support email
[3860.98 → 3864.06] and be like, hey, hey Nick, what's up?
[3864.72 → 3867.26] Um, I was just wondering what's up with the face pins.
[3868.42 → 3869.76] I'd like to buy one.
[3870.82 → 3871.66] They're so cool.
[3872.70 → 3873.52] Oh, here we go.
[3873.56 → 3873.72] Okay.
[3873.76 → 3874.54] Someone answered my question.
[3874.62 → 3877.26] He said, hey Luke, the series with Kyle was called Stack Attack.
[3877.34 → 3878.44] And that's totally correct.
[3878.44 → 3882.60] Because you had this stack of cards that you could like play against the other person.
[3882.68 → 3883.56] Then it gave them a handicap.
[3884.16 → 3884.76] That's pretty cool.
[3884.80 → 3884.96] Yeah.
[3885.02 → 3885.92] You guys should play Stack Attack.
[3886.08 → 3887.88] I actually really enjoyed watching those.
[3888.16 → 3889.36] Um, I don't know how well they did.
[3889.48 → 3893.08] So, I'm not sure what the response to, hey, we should do Stack Attack would be.
[3893.16 → 3893.58] But, yeah.
[3893.58 → 3899.42] Uh, $50 donation from someone named Very Unemployed, which is an interesting combination.
[3899.90 → 3905.08] Um, he says, as an architect and gamer, uh, 2080 Ti worth it?
[3905.12 → 3908.60] Or should I wait for a price drop when the new models drop?
[3908.78 → 3909.58] Any advice?
[3910.78 → 3912.80] You'll be waiting a long time.
[3912.92 → 3917.10] I don't think we're expecting anything new from NVIDIA until sometime in the middle of 2020.
[3917.10 → 3927.50] So, if you want to enjoy your graphics card for a little bit, uh, I mean, one of the best things to do is you buy whatever it is that you can afford to buy.
[3927.82 → 3931.12] And then you keep your eye on the news.
[3931.30 → 3933.20] You know, don't stop following the hardware.
[3933.52 → 3938.24] And then once the rumblings start to show up, you flip it.
[3938.60 → 3939.26] Use something.
[3939.46 → 3942.44] You know, you go back to your old card for a month or whatever.
[3942.44 → 3948.70] And then you get back, you know, 90% of what you spent on your 2080 Ti.
[3949.18 → 3953.78] And then you turn around, and you put that towards a 3080 Ti or whatever the case may be.
[3954.16 → 3964.58] And if you do that every generation, you only end up losing about, you know, one card worth of overall cost every, you know, eight to ten upgrades.
[3964.58 → 3974.92] Which is, in the long term, a lot cheaper than, you know, having it drop by 50% each generation or whatever the case may be if you're not staying on top of it.
[3975.12 → 3978.98] I mean, that's what I used to do when I was, uh, you know, young and poor and stuff.
[3979.22 → 3983.08] And I think GPUs would probably especially be a good example of that.
[3983.08 → 3994.08] Which is where, like, honestly upgrading every generation but doing it with that proper cadence is very possibly a better way to do it than waiting the like, three to four that most people do.
[3994.90 → 3995.08] Yep.
[3996.38 → 4000.64] And if you buy used in the first place, then you lose less value on the flip.
[4001.02 → 4003.18] So I was super into that.
[4005.12 → 4007.04] Just going through more of them now.
[4007.92 → 4009.14] Great videos as usual.
[4009.28 → 4010.70] Is Secret Shopper dead, though?
[4010.70 → 4013.54] Secret Shopper is not dead.
[4013.88 → 4022.64] We aren't doing it this fall slash winter, but we are hoping to bring it back next year with a new secret agent and a new co-host.
[4023.92 → 4028.00] Will it be, I don't know if you want to disclose this, will it be the same thing?
[4028.10 → 4033.80] Are you going to be buying full PCs from system integrators again, or are you going to be buying something else?
[4034.42 → 4038.94] Look, spy, we are not giving you any hints as to our plans.
[4038.94 → 4043.08] So you can go back to your boss and tell them you have no idea.
[4044.42 → 4044.94] Awesome.
[4046.86 → 4048.26] Oh my goodness.
[4049.90 → 4058.08] Brendan Stubbs sent a ton of Super Chats, at least four, that all say this Super Chat is sponsored by Gamers Nexus.
[4059.36 → 4060.72] Okay, thank you, Brendan.
[4060.98 → 4061.56] Fantastic.
[4061.56 → 4066.88] I asked Steve about that, and apparently it was just like a light-hearted offhand comment.
[4067.10 → 4067.34] Yeah.
[4067.52 → 4075.00] And then he was quite surprised that so many of his viewers ended up in the WAN show dropping Super Chat bombs on us.
[4075.00 → 4081.54] That light-hearted offhand comments seem to be what the internet really loves jumping on top of.
[4081.54 → 4085.92] Speaking of light-hearted offhand comments, can we cause some chaos here?
[4086.56 → 4089.76] Like, a WAN show viewers, how about this?
[4090.56 → 4098.14] On Steve's next stream, can you guys just pop in and be like The Verge sent us or something?
[4099.58 → 4100.26] Yes!
[4100.78 → 4101.66] Don't say LTT.
[4102.08 → 4102.74] Don't say LTT.
[4103.18 → 4105.50] Can you please make him shout out The Verge?
[4105.56 → 4107.86] I would love that so much.
[4108.18 → 4108.60] Oh my god.
[4108.60 → 4110.94] I would love it if he never figures out it was me.
[4111.14 → 4111.38] Yes.
[4111.38 → 4112.32] That would be amazing.
[4112.54 → 4114.14] You guys would totally make my Christmas.
[4114.52 → 4114.92] Oh yeah.
[4115.52 → 4116.32] That would be hilarious.
[4117.28 → 4118.10] Please do that.
[4118.64 → 4120.04] Someone said, yay, money for Luke.
[4120.14 → 4122.28] That's not how this works, but thank you very much.
[4122.34 → 4122.90] I appreciate it.
[4123.62 → 4126.70] Yeah, if you want to give money to Luke, you give it to him on his stream, which I think
[4126.70 → 4127.90] starts in like an hour and a half.
[4128.10 → 4128.38] Yeah.
[4128.88 → 4132.96] If I even do it, because I'm not sure how long my voice is going to hold up, but maybe.
[4134.48 → 4135.86] Loving the new hairstyle, Linus.
[4136.02 → 4136.82] I see you've gone blonde.
[4136.86 → 4137.32] Oh right.
[4137.44 → 4138.42] You are now a broom.
[4138.60 → 4141.60] With a sharpies face on it, by the way.
[4141.72 → 4142.68] Thank you.
[4143.06 → 4143.88] That's what I was going for.
[4146.04 → 4149.16] Lots of comments about the broom replacing Linus.
[4151.38 → 4152.84] Oh wait, is that what's there?
[4153.86 → 4156.98] Yeah, there's a broom with a little smiley face on it.
[4157.24 → 4158.34] Taken did something.
[4158.52 → 4158.92] I don't know.
[4159.50 → 4160.92] Oh, I didn't know that.
[4161.04 → 4163.22] I thought they were just commenting on my actual hair.
[4163.54 → 4164.22] Oh, no, no, no.
[4164.22 → 4167.42] Yeah, there's an actual like straw broom here.
[4167.54 → 4168.70] I don't know where he got it from.
[4169.24 → 4169.52] Sweet.
[4169.52 → 4177.62] Someone's shouting out a game, but I've never heard of it, so I'm not going to say the name
[4177.62 → 4180.08] just in case there's something weird because there are a lot of weird games these days.
[4180.08 → 4184.14] Are we going to have an LTT winter hat slash toque?
[4185.36 → 4186.60] We wanted to do one.
[4186.66 → 4190.96] We didn't get it done in time, and it won't be winter anymore by the time we could get something done, so no.
[4191.40 → 4191.78] Right.
[4191.88 → 4192.32] Makes sense.
[4192.42 → 4193.16] Maybe next winter.
[4193.16 → 4201.46] Super pumped for LTX 2020 living out our lives to be in the tech gods, tech geeks paradise.
[4202.24 → 4202.98] Heck yeah.
[4203.20 → 4203.60] Sweet.
[4206.20 → 4208.98] Is buying and selling used CPUs a thing?
[4209.10 → 4209.30] Yeah.
[4209.86 → 4210.48] Oh, yeah.
[4210.86 → 4211.48] I don't think it's...
[4211.48 → 4213.48] CPUs almost never die, so like...
[4213.48 → 4213.64] Yeah.
[4213.64 → 4216.18] It's one of the safest components to buy and sell used.
[4217.16 → 4217.60] Yeah.
[4218.02 → 4220.86] Even motherboards, because motherboards do die.
[4221.52 → 4221.76] Yeah.
[4221.76 → 4229.06] So if you keep a relatively old motherboard for probably roughly two, three generations
[4229.06 → 4233.60] and then try to flip it if it still works, you can make pretty good money because the
[4233.60 → 4235.98] CPUs will be more common and the motherboards will not.
[4236.52 → 4241.82] It's actually hilarious because motherboards have this weird value curve where they go way
[4241.82 → 4248.46] down and then way up, and it only started happening recently, like in the last five to six years,
[4248.46 → 4252.68] because CPU performance wasn't changing really dramatically.
[4253.00 → 4257.88] So there were all these old but like still perfectly good processors out there and no
[4257.88 → 4259.30] motherboards to install them in.
[4259.46 → 4259.66] Yeah.
[4259.66 → 4263.90] With that said, I think the way that AMD is pushing performance forward right now is going
[4263.90 → 4267.96] to mean a big drop-off in value for all ports compared to what we've been used to seeing
[4267.96 → 4269.32] over the past half a decade or so.
[4269.46 → 4270.52] I think that makes sense.
[4270.52 → 4275.50] I think it might be stemmed a little bit by the software side, not necessarily mirroring
[4275.50 → 4276.54] the performance improvement.
[4276.94 → 4277.42] That's fair.
[4277.42 → 4280.12] But the hype is definitely there.
[4280.72 → 4283.26] So I think it will have at least a bit of an impact.
[4283.68 → 4284.62] Hype, hype, hype, hype, hype.
[4284.84 → 4285.28] Yup.
[4287.14 → 4287.86] DA-da-da-da.
[4289.22 → 4294.38] Any update on the glow-in-the-dark, this is the last super chat, any update on the glow-in-the-dark
[4294.38 → 4295.98] constellations shirt experiment?
[4296.46 → 4302.36] I have watched it three times so far and up until this point I am pretty satisfied with
[4302.36 → 4305.26] the way that the glow-in-the-dark effect has remained on the shirt.
[4305.26 → 4309.00] I will be giving it a little bit more time.
[4309.74 → 4313.96] I don't want to draw my conclusions too early because if we're going to change something
[4313.96 → 4317.10] as beloved as constellations, we want to make sure that we're changing it for the better.
[4317.24 → 4318.28] But right now it looks promising.
[4322.18 → 4323.54] Sorry, I lied.
[4323.62 → 4324.58] There are more super chats.
[4324.76 → 4327.42] The super chat window was glitching out and wasn't showing them all.
[4328.04 → 4330.70] And I'm definitely going to end here, though, because I have to go home eventually.
[4331.54 → 4333.04] But there's two more.
[4333.04 → 4335.90] Ryan says, Linus, I need a new pair of sandals.
[4336.02 → 4336.54] What do you recommend?
[4338.02 → 4338.70] Oh, man.
[4338.78 → 4343.50] So usually I wear Echoes, but my last pair of them, honestly, not that great.
[4345.74 → 4346.36] Actually, wait.
[4346.42 → 4346.72] Hold on.
[4347.20 → 4348.20] Yeah, these are Echoes too.
[4348.30 → 4350.04] Yeah, no, my last pair of them is not that great.
[4350.20 → 4355.94] Like the flaps when you're closing the top one get kind of folded over each other and
[4355.94 → 4357.54] stuff when you're doing it up a lot of the time.
[4357.62 → 4358.60] It wears it out faster.
[4358.60 → 4363.96] That's Echo as an ECHO, right?
[4364.42 → 4364.68] Yeah.
[4365.24 → 4365.64] Yeah.
[4366.76 → 4370.96] I don't really have a solid recommendation, to be honest.
[4371.08 → 4372.68] I mean, let me just see.
[4372.76 → 4376.40] I think I still have my old pair that lasted a lot better.
[4376.52 → 4378.22] I'm trying to figure out what model it is.
[4379.18 → 4380.14] It's hard to say.
[4382.64 → 4384.30] Powered by receptor technology.
[4384.30 → 4384.98] Yeah, I don't know.
[4385.18 → 4390.40] Like, how hard is it for shoes to just like to have a proper model name on them?
[4390.54 → 4391.58] Yeah, shoe models are rough.
[4391.66 → 4393.62] Sometimes I think Nike does okay with it, but.
[4394.02 → 4394.38] Yeah.
[4396.94 → 4402.50] And then the last one is, Luke, this money would be yours if your PC could handle streaming.
[4402.84 → 4403.06] Oof.
[4404.20 → 4405.52] Oh, wow.
[4405.68 → 4406.00] Oof.
[4406.00 → 4408.04] Just shots fired.
[4408.06 → 4408.08] Oh, wow.
[4408.08 → 4409.64] I think that's what the kids call a big oof.
[4409.70 → 4410.70] Shots fired.
[4412.38 → 4413.28] But okay, guys.
[4413.38 → 4414.24] Thank you guys for coming.
[4414.70 → 4416.32] We'll see you next week.
[4416.56 → 4417.30] I'm going to roll the intro.
[4421.94 → 4423.82] I can't believe how random this was.
[4423.82 → 4430.10] Someone brought like the world's tiniest Apple box, which is some Ikea thing.
[4430.68 → 4437.20] And I stacked that with the comic book box on top of it and then put the phone on top of that.
[4440.02 → 4442.20] Um, no one's really complaining.
[4442.40 → 4444.44] So I think it's not great, but it's like fine.
[4445.40 → 4445.64] Yay.
[4446.72 → 4447.16] Squarespace.
[4448.38 → 4449.44] Comic garage.
[4449.78 → 4450.10] All right.
[4450.28 → 4450.90] Thank you guys.
[4450.90 → 4451.54] See you later.
