[0.00 → 3.90] All right, ladies and gentlemen, it is WAN Showtime again!
[4.52 → 8.46] Okay, David, no problem. You got this. It's all good, Brad.
[9.26 → 11.36] We have a lot of great topics for you today.
[11.74 → 13.84] Things happened. People are mad.
[13.96 → 15.54] Some stuff happened this week.
[17.28 → 20.42] Everyone's mad. The Chinese are mad.
[20.78 → 22.52] The people who aren't Chinese are mad.
[22.92 → 25.34] And that's basically the whole world, if you think about it.
[25.64 → 27.98] Yeah. It's like those two books,
[27.98 → 30.90] what they teach you in Harvard Business School and what they don't teach you in Harvard Business School.
[31.08 → 33.60] I now know everything. Thank you very much.
[34.40 → 39.12] So Blizzard banned a pro Hearthstone player for supporting the Hong Kong protest.
[39.34 → 40.12] We're going to get into that.
[40.14 → 42.34] And the commentators and took his money and banned him for a year.
[42.60 → 43.72] I said we'll get into it.
[43.72 → 45.06] There's way more news than that.
[45.16 → 46.48] I said we're going to get into it.
[48.64 → 50.68] Apple released Hong Kong protest map.
[51.32 → 52.16] App. App.
[52.24 → 52.46] App.
[52.58 → 53.26] Yeah, not a map.
[53.26 → 54.54] It's a map app.
[54.72 → 55.96] Well, okay, fair enough.
[57.98 → 60.28] In news that people are not as riled up about,
[60.50 → 64.92] Stadia will use AI to predict gamers' actions for negative latency.
[65.08 → 65.84] This is hilarious.
[67.10 → 69.92] We are that much closer to a self-playing game.
[70.32 → 71.44] And what else we got?
[71.54 → 72.44] He's going to aim at his head.
[72.62 → 74.36] I'm pretty sure he's going to aim at his head.
[74.54 → 75.28] We'll just take care of it.
[75.28 → 75.50] Oh, wow.
[75.62 → 77.06] I am so mad about this.
[77.28 → 79.36] But it's your turn to read the topic, so you go ahead.
[80.20 → 82.82] Steam to make local multiplayer games work online.
[82.96 → 83.82] You're mad about this.
[84.32 → 84.72] Wait.
[84.72 → 87.94] We'll transform by...
[87.94 → 89.42] Oh, no.
[89.66 → 90.32] This is amazing.
[90.48 → 90.64] Yeah.
[90.76 → 92.22] Oh, totally misunderstood the headline.
[92.36 → 92.70] We're good.
[92.94 → 93.64] Let's roll the intro.
[93.64 → 93.98] What did you think it said?
[94.22 → 94.96] We'll roll the intro.
[95.46 → 96.12] What do you think it said?
[96.12 → 97.50] Oh, I'll explain when we do the topic.
[97.66 → 98.82] Okay, that'll be it in a while.
[98.98 → 99.58] Go, do you think.
[99.66 → 100.02] Go, go, go.
[100.28 → 100.88] Oh, wait.
[101.02 → 101.46] I can do this.
[101.74 → 102.66] You got to hear the thing?
[102.66 → 103.28] You're going to start the Blizzard thing?
[103.34 → 104.26] I want to do the Blizzard thing.
[104.50 → 105.60] We're going to be here forever.
[105.72 → 106.80] It's a really long topic.
[107.04 → 107.66] I know.
[108.46 → 110.06] How ready are you guys for the iPhone?
[110.06 → 125.00] We're back.
[126.58 → 128.00] Okay, I don't know what we're doing.
[128.52 → 129.34] We're doing this.
[129.40 → 129.82] We're doing this.
[129.82 → 129.98] Okay.
[130.06 → 133.98] So, this was posted by Spartaman64 on the forum.
[134.30 → 134.90] And everyone else.
[134.90 → 135.50] And everyone.
[136.44 → 138.22] Do you want to read through this?
[138.22 → 139.00] No, go for it.
[139.08 → 139.36] Okay.
[139.62 → 145.16] So, Blitzkrieg, a pro Hearthstone player from Hong Kong, ended a stream earlier this week
[145.16 → 150.14] with a statement of support for those engaged in the month-long protests against local police
[150.14 → 152.04] and government in Hong Kong.
[152.24 → 152.48] Yes.
[152.68 → 157.36] If you haven't been keeping up with the news, then here you go.
[157.96 → 160.36] Beef pro the Hong Kong protests.
[161.04 → 161.90] That is all.
[161.90 → 164.82] That is the too long did not read.
[165.04 → 165.26] Okay?
[165.26 → 172.80] So, basically, as far as if you are pro free speech and freedom for individuals and against
[172.80 → 178.24] government oppression and all that crap, then this is a perfectly reasonable thing for Blitzkrieg
[178.24 → 178.68] to do.
[179.04 → 184.90] And as a result, Blizzard ruled that he violated competition rules and basically kicked him
[184.90 → 188.28] out of the Grand Masters tournament, took away his prize money, which was what?
[188.34 → 188.82] Ten grand?
[189.00 → 189.42] I think so.
[189.42 → 189.90] Something like that?
[189.90 → 190.42] Whatever.
[190.58 → 191.42] It doesn't even matter.
[191.48 → 192.16] Took away his prize money.
[192.20 → 201.50] Took away his prize money and banned him from taking part in Hearthstone Esports for 12 months.
[201.62 → 202.10] Solid year.
[202.24 → 203.80] Starting October 5th, 2019.
[203.98 → 204.98] Lines, you should do the pickup now.
[205.04 → 206.44] I'll just sit there while he explains the topic.
[206.46 → 207.22] But I'm mad.
[208.28 → 212.04] They also banned the commentators as well.
[212.04 → 213.52] Like, okay, no, I'm back.
[213.58 → 214.26] Hold on a second.
[214.98 → 217.50] What if the pickup's just someone else's voice?
[217.60 → 219.56] So, the craziest part of the comment...
[219.56 → 221.50] Okay, we should probably read through the whole thing.
[221.62 → 221.94] No, no.
[222.16 → 229.04] So, the craziest part of banning the commentators is that they even, like, tried to kind of cut
[229.04 → 232.30] him short, but I guess didn't do it, like, enough?
[232.56 → 238.28] They also kind of egged him on a little bit to start and then kind of cut him short as
[238.28 → 238.52] well.
[238.52 → 246.00] So, to be that guy, technically all of this was definitively against the contract.
[246.88 → 249.10] So, they are within legal bounds.
[249.12 → 250.12] Alright, I can leave for this part.
[250.24 → 250.66] But hold on.
[251.04 → 251.26] No.
[251.60 → 255.46] But that's like being in the like, lawful evil alignment in a board game.
[255.46 → 256.40] It truly is.
[256.40 → 257.06] It is basically the definition of lawful.
[257.06 → 258.86] Because you're following the law.
[259.16 → 259.42] Okay.
[259.58 → 260.04] You know what?
[260.26 → 261.16] Guys, I'm sorry.
[261.28 → 262.72] I'll be back in one second.
[263.02 → 263.92] BRB, tornado.
[264.20 → 264.78] I have to go.
[264.90 → 266.38] I don't even know exactly what it is.
[266.42 → 267.10] It's really quick, right?
[267.10 → 273.58] But, like, Blizzard can't be too surprised that this did happen because statements of
[273.58 → 279.18] solidarity with social and political movements have been happening in sports events for an
[279.18 → 280.18] extremely long time.
[280.70 → 282.18] There was the black glove thing.
[283.10 → 284.14] I don't remember all of them.
[284.26 → 284.74] Take a knee.
[284.74 → 284.78] Take a knee.
[284.90 → 289.38] There's been, they've been, they've been happening in sports and, I guess now, esports for a very
[289.38 → 290.00] long time.
[290.08 → 291.18] They're a very common thing.
[291.18 → 294.56] And I think the way that they reacted was rather heavy-handed.
[294.68 → 296.52] I'm going to keep on going through some of the notes here.
[296.52 → 300.76] Do you think that that part of the contract, given the context that you're outlining for
[300.76 → 303.76] us, do you think that when they're handed the contract for that tournament, that the
[303.76 → 306.68] person handing it to them said, hey, pay attention to this section.
[306.78 → 308.28] This is super relevant right now.
[308.34 → 314.96] One thing that I will bring up here is that I have heard, allegedly, that the commentators
[314.96 → 320.16] and Blitzkrieg both knew they were going to get in trouble going into this.
[320.36 → 321.22] Like it was his plan.
[321.42 → 322.16] This was planned.
[322.18 → 324.44] He knew this was against the TOS, but I'm going to do it anyway.
[324.54 → 324.86] Yes.
[325.64 → 326.58] And the commentators.
[327.14 → 327.30] Yeah.
[328.36 → 331.38] This is, as far, there's so much, I'm going to get more into it later.
[331.66 → 334.70] There's a fair amount of, like, conflicting information in this story.
[334.94 → 336.90] Some of it's pretty freaking solid.
[337.68 → 342.14] And there's a lot of the information I've had to, like, work and eat this week, so I haven't
[342.14 → 343.90] been able to keep up with 100% of it.
[343.90 → 347.28] But that's the allegedly part, is that they knew they were going to get in trouble.
[347.58 → 350.94] I don't necessarily know that they knew to what degree they're going to get in trouble.
[351.04 → 353.74] It's probably one of those things where it's like disciplinary actions, and they don't
[353.74 → 354.56] say what they are.
[354.82 → 357.64] So they probably didn't know, like, all the money was going to take away their ban for
[357.64 → 358.40] a year, all that kind of stuff.
[358.86 → 359.52] But they, thanks, buddy.
[359.80 → 362.42] But they knew to a certain degree that they were going to get in trouble.
[363.26 → 370.30] So what we brought up while you were gone is that Blizzard must keep in mind that these
[370.30 → 373.88] types of, like, statements or shits of things.
[373.90 → 377.68] Shows of solidarity have happened in sporting-style events for an extremely long time.
[378.22 → 379.98] This is far from the first time this has happened.
[380.44 → 381.94] And I think they reacted quite heavy-handed.
[382.28 → 383.36] Okay, so now we can continue on with this.
[383.36 → 384.46] They were extremely heavy-handed.
[384.74 → 385.04] Yes.
[385.14 → 389.10] Did we talk about the part where this is, in fact, well within their rights, but that
[389.10 → 390.00] we think it's stupid?
[390.08 → 391.72] Yeah, well, we said that before you left.
[391.80 → 392.74] Well, I was mad about that.
[392.74 → 394.38] So they were fully within legal rights.
[394.44 → 396.04] That was the lawful evil thing that I brought up.
[396.04 → 399.32] So in, did we bring up the exact terminology?
[400.26 → 400.78] No.
[400.92 → 403.42] And there's, like, more of that to come, too.
[403.60 → 405.14] I want to make sure we're going through these points.
[405.14 → 405.40] Fine.
[405.54 → 406.32] Okay, yes.
[407.00 → 413.66] Blizzard, aware of the political repercussions in the Chinese market, not even just political
[413.66 → 415.00] sphere, but market in general.
[415.00 → 420.48] This is something to understand, guys, is that it's not just the Chinese government.
[420.66 → 420.84] The bottles.
[421.46 → 421.72] Oh, yeah.
[422.46 → 423.12] Oh, yeah, this one, too.
[423.86 → 429.74] It's not just the Chinese government and the Communist Party and, you know, the kind of
[429.74 → 436.34] the officials that are going to get upset by something like, you know, expressing solidarity
[436.34 → 447.56] with the Hong Kong protesters or, you know, recognizing the sovereignty of Taiwan or something like that, for example.
[448.04 → 454.08] It's Chinese people, too, who get really edgy and really mad about this stuff.
[454.20 → 455.78] Yes, some Chinese people.
[456.32 → 459.82] It is a highly controversial topic over there.
[459.82 → 468.12] Whether we're talking Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, or any of the entities that China considers
[468.12 → 474.74] to be within China, but that themselves consider to be not so much within China.
[475.18 → 475.28] Yeah.
[476.58 → 483.38] So Blizzard is reacting not just necessarily to pressure from the Chinese government, but
[483.38 → 489.22] also to pressure from Chinese consumers who may, I guess, in their estimation.
[489.82 → 493.62] They're going to organize some kind of boycott against them, which could hurt their business
[493.62 → 498.14] in mainland China, which is, of course, one point whatever a billion potential customers
[498.14 → 498.34] at this point.
[498.34 → 498.60] It's a lot.
[498.68 → 503.40] Now, one thing to consider as well is actually Blizzard games in China don't actually seem
[503.40 → 509.22] to be as big of a percentage of Blizzard's income as you might expect, but the World of
[509.22 → 513.00] Warcraft movie made, I think it was like $220 million in China.
[513.76 → 515.16] Do they not have good movies there?
[515.16 → 519.12] It single-handedly made it a success because of China's income.
[519.12 → 520.74] And then it didn't do that well in North America.
[520.82 → 522.70] So they have some things that are working well there.
[523.06 → 524.48] Not everything is working well there, though.
[524.86 → 526.92] To move on, I just want to make sure we get through these points.
[526.92 → 526.96] Yeah, yeah.
[526.98 → 527.64] Fine, fine, fine.
[527.70 → 528.40] Get us through the points.
[528.40 → 528.64] Pull on forward.
[529.18 → 534.42] Blizzard also add that despite them physically ducking from comments on air and immediately
[534.42 → 538.98] cutting to a commercial, the company will also immediately cease working with both
[538.98 → 539.38] casters.
[539.38 → 540.48] So we mentioned this earlier.
[541.28 → 542.84] Involved in airing Blitzkrieg's statement.
[542.84 → 548.20] In response, the community has endeavoured to make the Overwatch character Mei an official
[548.20 → 553.28] mascot of the Hong Kong protests in hopes that the Blizzard game is banned in China.
[553.48 → 557.56] It didn't take long for the idea to catch on, and she's now on newscasts from Hong Kong,
[557.90 → 561.22] have appeared showing protesters with printouts of Mei's artwork.
[561.36 → 567.64] They've also edited her character intro video to include support for Hong Kong, and they've
[567.64 → 568.56] done a bunch of other stuff.
[568.56 → 572.24] This is actually a fascinating move, because they're trying to effectively make
[572.24 → 579.46] it so that to stop this imagery, they'd have to ban everything related to Blizzard, because
[579.46 → 582.26] it might creep onto other Blizzard characters as well.
[582.70 → 591.22] So they're trying to use a commercial, social move to screw Blizzard over even harder to do
[591.22 → 593.50] social repercussions for what they did.
[593.50 → 599.20] Some Blizzard employees who disagree with the company's moves have covered some of the company's
[599.20 → 603.16] values that carved into an orc statue in their campus.
[603.34 → 607.10] They're covered with think globally, every voice matters, etc.
[608.66 → 610.78] They've covered them with paper, apparently.
[611.84 → 613.40] So something fascinating.
[613.40 → 613.56] Sorry.
[613.70 → 614.22] This is breaking.
[615.02 → 621.64] Apparently, according to chat, Blizzard's CEO issued a statement very, very recently.
[621.64 → 623.00] That guy sucks a lot.
[623.38 → 624.14] Or Blizzard CEO.
[624.42 → 624.86] Okay, sorry.
[624.94 → 625.08] No.
[625.38 → 626.40] Activision Blizzard CEO.
[626.66 → 629.32] Is it Blizzard CEO, or is it the CEO of Activision Blizzard?
[629.32 → 630.14] Let me find out.
[630.20 → 632.18] I only briefly glanced at this.
[632.52 → 635.64] If it's Bobby Ko tick, it's Activision Blizzard, and he's a complete...
[635.64 → 636.44] That's what I was saying.
[636.52 → 637.32] Yeah, I don't like that guy.
[638.40 → 638.90] Hold on.
[638.90 → 639.06] Bobby Ko tick.
[639.06 → 639.40] Hold on.
[639.50 → 640.48] Let me see if I can find it.
[640.66 → 643.44] If someone could actually link us to it, that would be great.
[643.44 → 644.06] In the meantime...
[644.06 → 645.20] Because I Googled it, and I can't find it.
[645.24 → 645.74] In the meantime...
[645.74 → 645.92] Oh, no.
[645.98 → 646.30] J.L.
[646.38 → 648.04] and Braque just released a statement.
[648.26 → 648.48] Okay.
[648.82 → 649.62] So that's Blizzard.
[650.00 → 650.98] That's not Activision Blizzard.
[650.98 → 651.10] That's amazing.
[654.64 → 655.00] Okay.
[655.46 → 656.40] So I'll bring this up.
[656.46 → 657.10] Go ahead and keep doing your thing.
[657.10 → 659.04] Okay, so this one needs my screen to be shared.
[659.96 → 660.36] Yep.
[660.42 → 661.12] Let me get on that.
[661.70 → 663.16] So this is a tweet that's going out.
[663.22 → 665.70] It has 13,000 likes and 4,000 retweets.
[665.76 → 666.72] It's from Mark Kern.
[666.72 → 671.38] Mark Kern was somewhat divisive in getting Classic WoW to come back.
[672.06 → 674.48] Used to be a developer on, I believe, Classic WoW.
[674.96 → 677.96] And is a fairly political person.
[678.30 → 678.68] Hold on.
[678.74 → 678.94] Hold on.
[679.02 → 679.22] Hold on.
[679.36 → 679.64] Hold on.
[679.94 → 680.30] Okay.
[680.30 → 681.02] Trust me.
[681.10 → 681.42] Hold on.
[681.60 → 681.96] Trust me.
[682.02 → 682.26] Seriously.
[682.76 → 686.10] He's a fairly political person, and he's talked anti-Blizzard quite a bit.
[686.60 → 693.68] Now, with that in mind, whatever you think about that, he tweeted this out, which was
[693.68 → 695.66] a statement on Weibo.
[695.82 → 696.68] I'm probably saying that wrong.
[696.74 → 696.96] Weibo.
[696.96 → 697.58] Weibo.
[697.58 → 697.96] Weibo.
[697.96 → 698.08] Weibo.
[698.08 → 698.12] Weibo.
[698.12 → 699.08] Yeah.
[699.64 → 703.04] And he posted a translation to it saying, hold on, please.
[703.58 → 707.20] We are very angered and disappointed at what happened at the event last weekend and highly
[707.20 → 710.16] object the expression of personal and political beliefs in any of our events.
[710.34 → 712.68] As always, we will defend the pride and dignity of China at all costs.
[712.88 → 713.42] Hold on.
[713.42 → 714.14] Hold on.
[714.14 → 716.50] I really like that you have a red background while you're reading that.
[716.50 → 717.10] Hold on.
[717.10 → 718.52] Hold on.
[718.64 → 718.84] Okay.
[719.60 → 721.12] Switch over here.
[721.84 → 724.66] This is a different translation that was posted.
[725.14 → 731.26] And I have checked with a person who speaks Chinese that I know personally that has said,
[731.26 → 733.72] this statement is far more accurate.
[733.96 → 738.74] It doesn't say at all costs anywhere in the original post, et cetera.
[739.10 → 741.28] This is where some of the I mentioned this while I think you were gone too.
[741.54 → 743.54] There's information flying all over the place.
[743.68 → 746.58] We've got to be very careful about verifying all this kind of stuff.
[746.92 → 750.96] I'm not willing to say that this, the translation that I got from the person that I know that
[750.96 → 755.24] speaks Chinese is not exactly this, but it's very close.
[755.36 → 758.10] This statement is still terrible.
[758.46 → 758.78] I know.
[758.90 → 759.54] Okay, cool.
[759.54 → 761.26] So just so we're all on the same page.
[761.56 → 766.96] So this one says, we express our strong indignation and condemnation of the events in the Hearthstone
[766.96 → 773.20] Asia Pacific competition last weekend and resolutely oppose the dissemination of personal
[773.20 → 773.48] political.
[773.68 → 777.52] So one of the reasons why this one is kind of funky is because the wording is very specific
[777.52 → 778.22] and grandiose.
[778.56 → 778.72] Yeah.
[778.72 → 781.04] People are thinking that probably didn't get properly translated.
[781.20 → 781.56] Yeah, it was.
[781.84 → 787.40] And the translation that I got was a little bit more simple and I think it's probably a little
[787.40 → 787.94] bit more accurate.
[787.94 → 789.70] But it was close to this one.
[789.78 → 793.30] So it was more like we're going to safeguard national dignity.
[793.44 → 795.82] It wasn't like we're going to defend your honour at all costs.
[795.96 → 796.68] Very Orc-like.
[797.16 → 798.40] It wasn't quite that way.
[798.40 → 804.68] And then I got more information that this specific statement is from a company.
[805.08 → 810.04] I don't remember their name, but they like represent Blizzard in China or something.
[810.20 → 811.36] It's not even them officially.
[811.36 → 818.12] And then I figured out that this statement was actually part of like a retweet thing.
[818.50 → 818.68] Yeah.
[818.78 → 824.38] And it had a longer official statement from Blizzard, which said stuff along the lines of
[824.38 → 826.20] this.
[826.58 → 826.88] Oh, wait.
[826.92 → 827.12] Hold on.
[827.12 → 828.76] Which we don't actually need to show on stage.
[828.78 → 829.04] Oh, okay.
[829.04 → 830.10] It's just a notepad.
[830.54 → 834.74] Although we respect the freedom of expression individual...
[834.74 → 836.96] Freedom of expressing individuals' ideas.
[837.08 → 839.08] Again, this was very roughly translated.
[839.62 → 843.16] But we need to point out that all players must follow the rules and officials made for the
[843.16 → 843.34] game.
[843.86 → 844.86] That official's made for the game.
[845.46 → 845.82] Okay.
[845.82 → 847.02] So here it is.
[847.36 → 847.84] This went up.
[847.84 → 848.52] I just had to get all that out there.
[849.10 → 851.78] The Verges article is from five minutes ago.
[852.56 → 853.66] So here it is.
[854.74 → 859.60] Regarding last weekend's Hearthstone Grandmaster's tournament, that is about the most understated
[859.60 → 862.26] subject line I think I have ever...
[862.26 → 862.54] Okay.
[862.66 → 863.36] That is like...
[863.36 → 868.30] That is saying, we're done goofed without actually saying, we're done goofed.
[868.40 → 869.86] It's like regarding last night.
[870.06 → 870.28] You know?
[870.34 → 874.46] One of my ideas for the picture for this was just Big Blizzard Sophie.
[874.46 → 878.06] So the first line of this is also kind of hilarious to me.
[878.42 → 879.40] Hello, Blizzard community.
[879.72 → 882.54] Space dot, space dot, space dot.
[882.70 → 884.90] This is the biggest dot, dot, dot he could make.
[888.02 → 893.48] So, okay.
[893.72 → 894.56] Blah, blah, blah.
[895.50 → 898.66] These ports exist to create opportunities for players from around the world, from different
[898.66 → 901.50] cultures, from different backgrounds, to come together and compete and share their passion
[901.50 → 901.98] for gaming.
[902.10 → 904.44] It's extremely important to us to protect these channels and the parts of the world.
[904.46 → 908.18] The purpose they serve to bring the world together through epic entertainment, celebrate
[908.18 → 910.24] our players, and build diverse and inclusive communities.
[911.44 → 915.74] Our official esports tournament broadcast was used as a platform for our winner of this
[915.74 → 918.00] event to share his views with the world.
[919.28 → 921.36] Uh, yeah.
[921.36 → 921.86] And?
[921.86 → 922.36] Okay.
[922.36 → 926.08] What else we got?
[926.08 → 929.50] We interview competitors who are at the top of their craft to share how they feel.
[930.04 → 932.58] But don't share too much about how you really feel.
[933.02 → 934.68] We want to experience that moment with them.
[934.80 → 936.92] Hearing their excitement is a powerful way to bring us together.
[937.70 → 941.14] Over the weekend, Blitzkrieg used his segment to make a statement about the situation in Hong
[941.14 → 941.42] Kong.
[941.42 → 945.58] In violation of rules he acknowledged and understood, and this is why we took action.
[946.46 → 947.36] Every Voice Matters.
[947.36 → 948.34] That's all capitalized.
[948.38 → 949.62] Is that like a hashtag or something?
[950.22 → 950.80] What is that?
[950.84 → 951.86] Every Voice Matters.
[951.92 → 952.48] I don't know.
[952.64 → 955.72] And we strongly encourage everyone in our community to share their viewpoints in the
[955.72 → 957.58] many places available to express themselves.
[957.70 → 958.08] Sorry, guys.
[958.08 → 961.66] However, the official broadcast needs to be about the tournament and to be a place where
[961.66 → 962.28] all are welcome.
[962.56 → 965.44] In support of that, we want to keep the official channels focused on the game.
[966.54 → 968.64] Our shout casters to amplify excitement of the game.
[968.80 → 971.74] They elevate the walkability and help the esports viewing experience stay focused on
[971.74 → 973.16] the tournament and our amazing players.
[973.82 → 976.26] Thirdly, we're our actions based on the content of the message.
[976.26 → 979.96] So, we have the rules.
[980.24 → 984.02] If this had been the opposing viewpoint delivered in the same divisive and deliberate way, we would
[984.02 → 985.04] have felt and acted the same.
[985.40 → 987.80] So, yeah, probably.
[988.08 → 993.06] So, that's one thing I was going to say is like I understand the idea of not wanting
[993.06 → 998.28] your event, your gaming focused event to be overtaken by political stances.
[998.68 → 1001.20] I get that kind of regardless of what they are.
[1001.20 → 1003.78] That hasn't been great for the NFL over the last three years.
[1004.00 → 1004.26] No.
[1004.48 → 1009.44] And it takes a lot of the conversation away from the game, which as like a fan of the
[1009.44 → 1015.20] I mean, I don't care about Hearthstone, but as a fan of game, let's insert just whatever,
[1016.00 → 1017.76] I wouldn't want it to be taken over.
[1018.08 → 1022.44] I would be disappointed that this had been taken over by political stuff if I was a fan
[1022.44 → 1022.92] of Hearthstone.
[1023.14 → 1023.80] That would suck.
[1023.80 → 1029.84] At the same time, because like I'm sure everyone knows stuff is going on in Hong Kong right
[1029.84 → 1030.00] now.
[1030.30 → 1032.96] At the same time, I think their response was ridiculous.
[1033.66 → 1039.98] So, it goes on to say that when we think about the suspension, six months for Blitzkrieg is
[1039.98 → 1044.80] more appropriate, and they're doing the same thing for the casters, reducing their sentence
[1044.80 → 1047.62] from 12 to six months.
[1047.62 → 1053.26] But considering they have to get hired and Blitzkrieg has to qualify, they're probably
[1053.26 → 1054.90] not going to get hired ever again.
[1055.56 → 1056.08] So...
[1056.08 → 1058.16] Just to put that out there.
[1058.48 → 1060.42] Or they will just to be like, we're not angry.
[1060.42 → 1067.10] A six-month suspension in esports, particularly as a caster, is basically a career Ender.
[1067.46 → 1067.96] You're done.
[1068.66 → 1072.36] And I don't mean that in like a, I'm just trying to be a downer kind of way.
[1072.70 → 1078.62] But these are not NBA athletes that are making more than an entry-level contract and making
[1078.62 → 1084.86] millions of dollars a year to the point where if they get a six-month subscription, they're
[1084.86 → 1091.32] losing 2.6 of their $5.2 million a year deal or whatever the case may be.
[1091.48 → 1098.34] This is not, esports is not at that professional sports level where you get paid whether you
[1098.34 → 1100.14] win or not because it's just huge.
[1100.56 → 1104.12] Well, you were talking about the commentators and commentating is extremely competitive.
[1104.12 → 1110.62] I know someone personally, he's a good friend of mine from way back high school who went
[1110.62 → 1112.58] decently far in Counter-Strike casting.
[1113.16 → 1117.14] And he was doing a perfect job and had some like really legit gigs and still couldn't
[1117.14 → 1120.34] like completely make it work just because of financial reasons.
[1120.50 → 1120.72] Yep.
[1120.88 → 1121.80] And it's hard.
[1121.86 → 1123.06] Because you're not getting paid that much.
[1123.18 → 1127.18] So what I'm trying to say, I guess, is that regardless of how much that NBA player,
[1127.30 → 1131.92] and whether we're talking NBA or NHL or NFL or whatever the case may be, the point that
[1131.92 → 1138.04] I'm trying to make is that these are not traditional media cushy gigs where these people have been
[1138.04 → 1142.90] working at them for the last eight years, and they've got a very comfortable float set up
[1142.90 → 1147.16] for them that if something happens to go wrong, and they're six months before they land a new
[1147.16 → 1148.52] gig, like, oh, you know what?
[1148.54 → 1149.16] It's no big deal.
[1149.22 → 1152.36] I guess I'll just, you know, eat some Kraft dinner for a bit.
[1152.42 → 1154.26] I'll still be able to make my rent, you know?
[1154.26 → 1157.46] I don't know if any of these people stream.
[1157.90 → 1159.48] I don't know any of these people.
[1159.68 → 1160.46] Me neither, unfortunately.
[1160.90 → 1162.92] But maybe go watch their stream or something.
[1163.00 → 1165.84] Try to support them in the meantime if you want to do that.
[1167.54 → 1169.36] Something to think of if you're interested.
[1171.16 → 1177.40] So let me just see if there's anything else that some blizzard in place who disagree with
[1177.40 → 1177.64] companies.
[1177.76 → 1178.14] Yeah, okay.
[1178.14 → 1180.60] So that's pretty much it.
[1183.92 → 1187.06] I feel like I've kind of said everything I have to say on the subject.
[1187.54 → 1187.70] Yeah.
[1187.92 → 1194.94] I wanted to point out the officially not really Chinese statement thing just because there's
[1194.94 → 1197.22] a lot of confusion going on there.
[1197.58 → 1197.84] Sure.
[1197.98 → 1199.90] So I'm happy I was able to bring that up.
[1200.30 → 1205.52] I don't have the source for it's relatively easy to find.
[1205.52 → 1212.00] And if you can find this Weibo.com post thing, it was found by the person that helped me
[1212.00 → 1214.00] with the Chinese translation, the full post.
[1214.64 → 1217.22] And it's a little bit more grounded.
[1217.64 → 1222.42] And then this comment that came in is, as far as I know, this could be false.
[1222.58 → 1226.26] As far as I know, this comment that came in that's actually on the screen right now that
[1226.26 → 1231.90] is supposedly translated, but I believe inaccurately, is from a company that represents Blizzard in
[1231.90 → 1232.10] China.
[1232.16 → 1233.56] I don't remember what they're called right now.
[1233.56 → 1233.92] Got it.
[1233.92 → 1235.24] It's like a PR firm or something.
[1235.24 → 1240.12] I don't remember what it is, but it's somewhere in this tweet feed thing.
[1240.46 → 1241.88] Someone comments on it part way through.
[1242.08 → 1242.54] Do I have your mic?
[1242.88 → 1243.44] Oh, yeah.
[1243.50 → 1244.10] You need my microphone?
[1244.26 → 1244.38] Sure.
[1244.46 → 1244.82] Here you go.
[1245.24 → 1245.58] Thank you.
[1245.78 → 1253.90] So just remember, even in all these emotionally heightened situations, to try to verify sources
[1253.90 → 1256.72] and check things and dive into things a little bit deeper on your own.
[1257.84 → 1258.38] All right.
[1258.44 → 1259.16] So I lied.
[1259.82 → 1261.08] There's still more to discuss.
[1261.22 → 1261.48] Okay.
[1261.48 → 1268.38] So I think that you and I probably both agree that there does need to be some separation of
[1268.38 → 1269.72] entertainment and politics.
[1269.72 → 1275.30] Because the cool part of truth is that Blizzard has many different customers to consider.
[1275.80 → 1279.82] They have their customers in China on either side of this issue.
[1279.82 → 1282.10] They have their customers in Hong Kong.
[1282.22 → 1284.26] They have their customers around the world.
[1284.42 → 1289.32] And then they have their customers who really don't identify as any of that and just want
[1289.32 → 1290.48] to watch people play video games.
[1291.12 → 1293.82] Who just want absolutely nothing to do with any of it.
[1293.90 → 1295.72] And maybe this is actually their release.
[1296.28 → 1298.64] Or I want to add this one in there.
[1298.64 → 1302.88] Maybe they're hardcore about this and just need a break.
[1303.32 → 1303.92] Yeah, exactly.
[1304.68 → 1312.02] So with that in mind, I think Linus Tech Tips is a perfect example of this.
[1312.02 → 1318.52] Like, I don't get really deep into pretty much any political cause unless there's something
[1318.52 → 1323.96] that comes up in the news that just is so obvious.
[1324.18 → 1329.48] Like the right to be able to speak out against your government and stuff like that.
[1329.56 → 1333.02] That I just kind of have to go, okay, yeah, that is pretty straightforward.
[1333.18 → 1335.54] And we should probably throw our voice behind it.
[1335.54 → 1341.12] But as far as like my own political views, I don't really get too deep into it, especially
[1341.12 → 1342.18] outside WAN show.
[1342.40 → 1349.50] I've been floored in the last few years how so many people have taken political and moral
[1349.50 → 1350.60] direction from companies.
[1351.66 → 1352.48] Like why?
[1352.68 → 1353.48] Why is that?
[1353.48 → 1353.68] Why?
[1353.74 → 1355.86] I have some theories as to why this is a thing.
[1356.60 → 1357.94] But why is this a thing?
[1357.94 → 1361.54] That sounds like more of a when we get together on the weekend and hang out conversation than
[1361.54 → 1362.32] a WAN show conversation.
[1362.32 → 1366.40] But just the whole idea of taking that direction from companies is very weird.
[1366.54 → 1369.92] And that's exactly what our typical approach to it is.
[1370.06 → 1378.66] And quite frankly, if we had one of our employees running around making very incendiary political
[1378.66 → 1384.26] statements all the time, we'd say, at the very least, we'd say, look, you have to consider
[1384.26 → 1390.14] that whether your personal Twitter has one of those nice little disclaimers, these are
[1390.14 → 1392.34] my personal opinions and don't reflect my company.
[1392.66 → 1397.64] If half your tweets are pictures of yourself at the office, interacting with your coworkers
[1397.64 → 1402.46] and about the projects you're working on at the company, you need to understand that
[1402.46 → 1404.34] this affects your personal brand.
[1404.92 → 1411.30] You have to think about the way that you conduct yourself online in much the same way that you
[1411.30 → 1414.50] think about the way you conduct yourself at something like a formal dinner party.
[1414.50 → 1421.96] Where people can see you and observe you and watch your behaviour who don't really know
[1421.96 → 1429.54] you and may not fully understand you or maybe don't speak the language that you speak very
[1429.54 → 1432.10] well and could easily misinterpret you.
[1432.68 → 1437.14] So you really need to consider that in the way that you conduct yourself online because
[1437.14 → 1439.40] you really are just putting yourself out there.
[1439.40 → 1444.20] Unless you more or less hide who you work for, you're effectively a spokesperson for
[1444.20 → 1445.24] your company at all times.
[1446.32 → 1450.78] Not actually, but like how people are going to see it is going to be that way.
[1450.80 → 1452.14] I didn't make those rules.
[1453.76 → 1458.88] Unfortunately, Twitter, I mean, I guess Facebook to a lesser extent, but Twitter's been the one
[1458.88 → 1463.34] where something happens, and then it spreads like wildfire.
[1463.34 → 1470.18] Twitter, the Twitter culture is such that people kind of grasp onto whatever the smallest
[1470.18 → 1473.22] things are because it's like, so what's this person's at handle?
[1474.26 → 1475.38] Where do they work?
[1476.04 → 1477.22] What do they do?
[1477.52 → 1478.78] Who do they associate with?
[1478.82 → 1484.44] And all of a sudden, it's almost like a it's almost like a pseudo social credit system
[1484.44 → 1485.06] in a way.
[1485.40 → 1491.38] The way that people judge the statements and photos that people post on a platform like
[1491.38 → 1491.64] Twitter.
[1491.64 → 1495.30] And so it's something that we've had to be aware of.
[1495.44 → 1499.08] I mean, it used to be back when we founded Linus Media Group, it was actually our policy
[1499.08 → 1504.16] to say that everybody who worked here had to have a Twitter because I felt like it was
[1504.16 → 1510.26] really important not to shield our staff from people, but to like to give them a platform to
[1510.26 → 1511.34] increase their notoriety.
[1511.48 → 1516.02] I mean, Luke's like a game streamer now or something and that wouldn't have happened if
[1516.02 → 1517.76] we had sort of given him.
[1517.76 → 1524.16] Hey, at least four dozen people were watching last time I tuned in.
[1524.58 → 1524.70] Okay.
[1525.72 → 1530.10] Hey, Intel sponsored you to go to PAX East not that long ago.
[1530.32 → 1532.00] Yeah, that's true.
[1532.54 → 1534.16] They sponsored you as a game streamer.
[1534.16 → 1535.12] I don't know if you remember this.
[1535.12 → 1541.34] I think my conversations about games are probably far more interesting than me playing games.
[1541.66 → 1542.20] Either way.
[1542.56 → 1543.36] Either way.
[1543.44 → 1547.22] The point is that we didn't want to shield people.
[1548.24 → 1549.84] Some companies do have policies.
[1549.98 → 1550.08] Yeah.
[1550.08 → 1550.92] Like keep your mouth shut.
[1551.00 → 1551.98] Say nothing about work.
[1552.86 → 1553.06] Yeah.
[1553.16 → 1554.06] Whereas we didn't.
[1554.42 → 1558.76] Nowadays, we don't really push people about it anymore because we've become a lot more
[1558.76 → 1559.18] diverse.
[1559.96 → 1560.68] And we see.
[1561.00 → 1561.90] A lot of people to follow.
[1561.98 → 1563.08] And the climate has changed.
[1563.24 → 1563.60] That too.
[1564.02 → 1567.98] The climate has absolutely changed in the last, even just the last five, six, seven years.
[1568.66 → 1570.58] So, okay.
[1570.96 → 1576.62] So with all of that in mind, knowing that as a company, anyone who associates with you
[1576.62 → 1578.84] is going to reflect on you in some way.
[1578.84 → 1583.44] And the thing about a controversial issue is that by its very definition, when you take
[1583.44 → 1587.34] a side, you will piss off somebody, probably a lot of somebodies.
[1588.36 → 1589.96] How would you have handled this as Blizzard?
[1591.90 → 1594.66] I think I was actually going to ask you the same thing.
[1595.12 → 1595.80] I knew you were.
[1595.86 → 1597.04] That's why I didn't give you a gap.
[1597.42 → 1597.94] Of course.
[1598.64 → 1600.08] So I am going to answer this.
[1600.12 → 1602.66] But one thing I want to bring up before I forget, because you just reminded me because
[1602.66 → 1603.92] of the Twitter thing.
[1604.04 → 1604.20] Yeah.
[1605.26 → 1609.52] Something kind of entertaining that happened around this whole thing that I noticed.
[1609.86 → 1613.52] And some people were like, oh, they recently came out with a new expansion or something.
[1613.80 → 1614.12] Whatever.
[1614.12 → 1619.92] Magic the Gathering Arena has pumped ads around this issue.
[1620.30 → 1625.04] They started just pumping, as far as I can tell, as many ads as they could possibly get
[1625.04 → 1629.42] onto YouTube and a bunch of other stuff immediately when they started hitting.
[1629.80 → 1631.16] And it was amazing.
[1631.50 → 1633.36] That was a move right there.
[1633.46 → 1634.22] That was a strategic move.
[1634.40 → 1634.72] Whatever.
[1634.84 → 1635.46] They have a new expansion?
[1635.64 → 1635.84] Sure.
[1636.12 → 1636.38] Great.
[1636.38 → 1642.08] But I'm 100% certain that they bought more ad space due to this whole thing.
[1642.70 → 1642.88] Okay.
[1643.12 → 1645.76] So I've actually talked to a few people about this.
[1645.92 → 1647.56] And I'm very unsure.
[1647.80 → 1651.78] And I would want to talk to a group of internal people to try to figure it out.
[1652.06 → 1652.18] Yeah.
[1652.44 → 1655.44] I think something would probably have to happen.
[1655.84 → 1656.12] Yeah.
[1656.30 → 1658.66] Because I don't want every event to turn into this.
[1658.66 → 1666.34] One thing that I had considered was dissolve his winnings and place them across the other
[1666.34 → 1666.78] contestants.
[1667.18 → 1667.48] Mm-hmm.
[1668.00 → 1670.30] But not ban him for six months.
[1671.88 → 1674.78] And maybe do something similar with the casters.
[1674.88 → 1675.50] I'm not sure.
[1676.18 → 1677.84] But just make it...
[1677.84 → 1678.62] I don't know.
[1678.70 → 1682.66] Some way that it's not super impactful, but it's like you probably don't want to do that
[1682.66 → 1683.02] anymore.
[1683.18 → 1684.70] And other people aren't going to want to do it.
[1684.70 → 1685.70] So without...
[1686.64 → 1687.40] So here's the thing.
[1687.40 → 1694.42] Because this blew up so big, it's hard to go back in retrospect and say, well, here's
[1694.42 → 1695.36] what they could have done differently.
[1695.46 → 1700.74] Because if they had done something differently, this might not have gotten so big.
[1700.80 → 1707.14] And in fact, I do not know for a fact that no one has ever done anything like this before
[1707.14 → 1708.98] with a lighter consequence.
[1709.20 → 1716.20] So my gut reaction, my gut reaction when I see it is for Blizzard to have ripped the stream
[1716.20 → 1717.46] down or gone to add or whatever.
[1718.10 → 1723.74] I don't think there's necessarily anything wrong with that in the context of, look, this
[1723.74 → 1724.48] is a sporting event.
[1724.66 → 1724.78] Yeah.
[1724.78 → 1725.66] It's about sports.
[1725.82 → 1726.04] Yeah.
[1726.20 → 1727.24] Or esports, as it were.
[1727.48 → 1729.16] And it is not about politics.
[1729.96 → 1730.32] Chill out.
[1730.36 → 1735.86] Because he did wear the mask and everything, which was pretty far to take it.
[1735.86 → 1739.86] Like you can make a statement without putting on a costume, I guess.
[1740.86 → 1742.32] And if you think about sort of...
[1742.32 → 1743.14] I don't know what the right thing to do is.
[1743.14 → 1747.26] Think about the kind of the decorum that's expected in a post-game interview for a hockey
[1747.26 → 1748.66] game or a football game.
[1748.66 → 1754.76] If someone starts putting on like masks and stuff, you're like, the cameras are going
[1754.76 → 1755.26] to get cut.
[1755.38 → 1755.56] Yeah.
[1756.06 → 1757.82] So I understand that.
[1758.58 → 1764.48] But if I was them, and I'm saying right now, so I'm counting on my chat to jump in here.
[1764.90 → 1766.28] Everyone probably hates me right now.
[1766.28 → 1774.72] So if I was them, maybe this has happened before, I would have said, look, no consequence
[1774.72 → 1775.44] this time.
[1775.56 → 1775.78] Yeah.
[1776.04 → 1784.64] But very publicly to everyone, I would have said, if this ever happens again, it will be
[1784.64 → 1787.40] a heavy-handed consequence.
[1788.12 → 1791.64] Expect a one-year ban from participating in Blizzard esports.
[1791.64 → 1792.58] I think that makes sense.
[1792.58 → 1793.08] Yes.
[1793.46 → 1794.52] Because like you don't...
[1794.52 → 1799.86] My biggest thing, if I was Blizzard in this position, is that I don't want this to happen
[1799.86 → 1800.74] again in the future.
[1800.98 → 1801.28] Yes.
[1801.44 → 1803.10] I don't necessarily care.
[1803.50 → 1807.12] You can't change what the milk that has already been spilled.
[1807.14 → 1807.24] Yes.
[1807.42 → 1807.70] Yes.
[1808.22 → 1815.20] But what you can say in a way that doesn't make everybody mad is instead of punishing those
[1815.20 → 1820.24] individuals, which really looks like taking a stand, you don't punish those individuals
[1820.24 → 1826.06] and you come out and say, we at Blizzard are not taking a side in this, which they, to
[1826.06 → 1827.60] my knowledge, never actually did.
[1828.30 → 1830.40] We at Blizzard are not taking a side in this.
[1831.00 → 1833.34] There's the like defend China stuff.
[1834.20 → 1835.26] So there you go.
[1835.80 → 1836.24] So right.
[1836.52 → 1838.76] So correct me if I'm wrong.
[1838.82 → 1840.94] I don't think they ever actually said it.
[1840.94 → 1841.34] I don't know how it's worded.
[1841.34 → 1841.66] Yeah.
[1841.68 → 1845.22] I don't know what exactly the word is, but they never came out and just said, we are
[1845.22 → 1846.66] not taking any side in this.
[1848.22 → 1850.18] And I don't think companies really should.
[1850.30 → 1852.10] That should be for people, not companies.
[1853.38 → 1861.74] But whether you like it or not, a lot of companies build their brand based on a cultural identity.
[1862.80 → 1863.98] That's the Apple formula.
[1864.12 → 1866.52] And as soon as Apple does something, everyone does it.
[1866.90 → 1869.54] Everybody's watching the way that Apple operates their business.
[1869.54 → 1871.68] I just don't think people should take.
[1872.02 → 1874.54] Well, that's a separate conversation from companies.
[1874.84 → 1879.94] So what I would have liked to see is Blizzard coming, Blizzard basically taking no action
[1879.94 → 1883.66] against the individuals because of the way they should, they must have known that was
[1883.66 → 1884.60] how it was going to be perceived.
[1884.62 → 1885.38] Clearly not.
[1888.02 → 1889.40] What does that even mean?
[1890.12 → 1896.60] And they should have taken action against the airing of political dirty laundry in their
[1896.60 → 1896.92] events.
[1896.92 → 1897.12] Yeah.
[1897.22 → 1902.46] I like the idea of being like, okay, not this time, but this is the like, everybody gets
[1902.46 → 1903.24] one warning.
[1904.42 → 1908.74] And in the future, we don't want any political stuff at any events, and we'll be heavy-handed
[1908.74 → 1909.10] about that.
[1909.24 → 1910.48] I think that's a fair response.
[1910.66 → 1911.72] I like that more than mine.
[1911.92 → 1918.62] Mine was like trying to make it light, but moving forward quickly.
[1918.62 → 1921.52] But I like, I like that one more.
[1921.80 → 1924.02] So super chat just came in.
[1924.10 → 1925.64] It's not the first chat about it.
[1925.68 → 1926.68] What about Colin Kaepernick?
[1927.24 → 1928.86] So here's the thing.
[1929.38 → 1933.82] Colin Kaepernick was an excellent learning opportunity for leagues around the world.
[1933.82 → 1941.88] And based on what the injection of politics, which to be very clear, cannot be hung on Colin
[1941.88 → 1943.20] Kaepernick's head alone.
[1943.20 → 1951.62] But based on what has happened to the culture within the NFL around the injection of politics
[1951.62 → 1958.08] into that game, if I was any other league, I would be trying to figure out how to keep
[1958.08 → 1960.04] it way away from mine.
[1960.54 → 1965.46] That has not been a positive thing for the NFL, for any of the teams.
[1965.46 → 1969.18] And by extension, theoretically, the players.
[1969.32 → 1974.90] Not that I personally am of the mind that most sporting leagues do a great job of sharing
[1974.90 → 1976.88] their earnings with their key talent.
[1977.12 → 1981.66] This happens a lot where people misconstrue stuff we say on Land Show because we have to
[1981.66 → 1984.46] say it live and things don't always get 100% out perfectly.
[1984.78 → 1990.44] But there's a lot of people in chat that like aggressively, very aggressively do not understand
[1990.44 → 1995.22] the words that are being said in any form at all.
[1995.46 → 1996.48] I'm trying.
[1996.68 → 2002.30] Linus is not like positive to genocide.
[2002.94 → 2003.76] Someone said that.
[2004.22 → 2004.92] Yeah, I don't know.
[2005.54 → 2007.34] There's some weird stuff going down to chat.
[2007.34 → 2008.76] I just want to be very clear.
[2009.82 → 2010.60] One thing.
[2010.74 → 2011.22] Well, hold on.
[2011.32 → 2012.46] Whose genocide are we talking about?
[2014.52 → 2015.74] In Supreme Commander.
[2018.08 → 2019.48] Vibrant shall rule forever.
[2019.48 → 2019.76] Yeah.
[2022.70 → 2026.84] There's another thing where people are like talking about how we're talking about China's
[2026.84 → 2027.06] actions.
[2027.30 → 2030.22] No, right now we're talking about Blizzard's actions, to be very clear.
[2030.32 → 2033.68] Someone was like, this would never happen because China does everything heavy-handed.
[2033.90 → 2034.42] And it's like, well.
[2034.70 → 2035.68] What is going on?
[2035.78 → 2035.92] Yeah.
[2035.96 → 2039.58] So my wife is messaging me saying people think I'm coming across pro-China.
[2039.66 → 2041.08] When did I say anything pro-China?
[2041.08 → 2042.98] Yeah, I don't know where any of this is coming from.
[2044.12 → 2045.94] I would actually like to know.
[2046.04 → 2047.48] Guys, hit me in the chat.
[2048.20 → 2050.16] Where's the pro-China statement here?
[2050.94 → 2052.16] You low-key sound pro-China.
[2052.30 → 2053.24] None of this makes sense.
[2053.42 → 2054.02] I don't get it.
[2054.14 → 2055.64] There's a lot of confusion in the chat.
[2057.08 → 2058.52] It's not a politics show.
[2058.90 → 2060.82] We're not very good at discussing politics.
[2061.34 → 2062.20] Keep that in mind.
[2062.50 → 2064.78] I would like that to remain.
[2064.78 → 2068.14] What nation are we talking about?
[2068.20 → 2069.24] We're only talking about Blizzard.
[2069.94 → 2070.82] We're talking about Blizzard.
[2070.94 → 2072.04] Blizzard is not a nation.
[2072.30 → 2074.24] We're talking very specifically about Blizzard.
[2075.34 → 2076.98] We didn't say Blizzard was right.
[2077.40 → 2079.48] We had no point in time said Blizzard was right.
[2079.70 → 2084.78] We said that Blizzard was technically within their legal rights, but we didn't say that
[2084.78 → 2084.96] was the right thing to do.
[2084.96 → 2086.62] We described it as lawful evil.
[2086.80 → 2087.14] Yeah.
[2087.38 → 2089.26] Have you ever played an RPG?
[2090.06 → 2091.94] Like, I don't get it.
[2092.30 → 2093.58] Lawful evil means evil.
[2094.02 → 2094.46] Yeah.
[2094.46 → 2098.20] But they're following the law, which is what they did.
[2102.28 → 2103.52] LOL just ignored.
[2105.04 → 2105.36] Ugh.
[2109.10 → 2109.70] What?
[2112.62 → 2117.76] I can't even find anyone who's saying anything coherent about what we said that was pro-China.
[2117.88 → 2123.70] So I would love so much to address it, but it's very, very difficult for me to address
[2123.70 → 2124.88] something that I'm not sure.
[2127.88 → 2130.96] Well, now I don't see it anymore because I think they stopped.
[2130.96 → 2133.22] Red background.
[2133.22 → 2134.44] There's a blue one, too.
[2134.96 → 2135.72] Come on.
[2136.42 → 2136.76] You know what?
[2136.76 → 2138.10] It's been there for years.
[2140.02 → 2140.38] Ugh.
[2140.38 → 2145.96] Why don't we move into Stadia uses AI to predict, uh...
[2145.96 → 2146.24] What?
[2146.24 → 2148.68] To censoring speech in China for corporate profits.
[2148.80 → 2151.92] You said you would have given anyone giving a political...
[2151.92 → 2152.94] But it could have...
[2152.94 → 2153.18] What?
[2153.44 → 2156.06] You said you would have given anyone giving a political statement...
[2156.06 → 2158.52] What are you talking about, euphoric me?
[2158.52 → 2162.68] You need to be slightly less euphoric and a little more coherent.
[2163.68 → 2165.46] Censoring speech in China?
[2165.74 → 2166.10] What?
[2166.10 → 2166.44] No.
[2166.62 → 2172.14] We are talking about what, as a sporting league, they should have done to make their sporting
[2172.14 → 2174.14] event about sports.
[2174.30 → 2178.88] Something to be really clear about, too, because that is a thousand percent what we're saying.
[2179.26 → 2185.08] This is not a free speech argument because it's a company's platform.
[2185.18 → 2186.70] Free speech is from a government perspective.
[2186.70 → 2188.34] Okay.
[2188.52 → 2189.76] So are we doing that again?
[2190.10 → 2194.58] Are we doing the whole thing where people don't understand the difference between free
[2194.58 → 2197.58] speech and the ability to say anything you want anywhere you want?
[2197.58 → 2198.70] So the forum...
[2200.02 → 2201.48] MinusTechTipsForum.com.
[2201.62 → 2203.56] You are not entitled to free speech there.
[2203.56 → 2208.90] If you post a thing that has every swear word in the dictionary on it and then just go,
[2209.14 → 2211.88] like, I'm allowed to keep this post up, mods are going to remove it.
[2211.90 → 2215.06] We'll remove it, and then you will post it again, and then we will ban you.
[2215.24 → 2215.48] Yeah.
[2215.48 → 2217.78] Because it's supposed to be a forum about tech.
[2219.44 → 2224.08] Because we are trying to keep that platform on topic.
[2224.36 → 2225.04] And the topic is tech.
[2225.04 → 2231.24] We also have, speaking of things that we keep away from our forum, politics, if a thread,
[2231.24 → 2237.34] even if it starts out discussing technology, like, you know, for example, something that
[2237.34 → 2237.84] the...
[2237.84 → 2239.84] Also both sides, to be really clear.
[2239.84 → 2239.88] Yeah.
[2239.88 → 2245.04] Like something like net neutrality, for example, has for some reason become a political topic,
[2245.04 → 2247.64] even though it is definitely a technology topic.
[2247.64 → 2252.02] If your thread devolves into political mudslinging...
[2252.02 → 2253.60] And a number of them have.
[2253.68 → 2254.32] We lock it.
[2254.56 → 2256.26] And a number of them have been locked.
[2256.36 → 2256.66] Why?
[2257.02 → 2260.44] Because as a business, we are about technology.
[2260.62 → 2267.42] If people wanted to discuss Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton or whatever, there are a thousand
[2267.42 → 2271.24] other places, probably tens of thousands of places online that they can go do that.
[2271.24 → 2272.74] Also a big one for us.
[2272.78 → 2272.90] Yeah.
[2273.06 → 2273.60] Straight up.
[2273.78 → 2274.78] The mods are all volunteers.
[2274.78 → 2274.88] What?
[2275.46 → 2276.64] The mods are all volunteers.
[2276.98 → 2277.82] And they don't have time.
[2278.00 → 2279.86] They don't have time to deal with all of that.
[2280.42 → 2282.82] So we just don't allow those conversations.
[2283.16 → 2286.96] Because we would have to, like, hire staff and pay them to manage those conversations.
[2287.14 → 2287.32] Yeah.
[2287.86 → 2289.44] The forum doesn't make any money.
