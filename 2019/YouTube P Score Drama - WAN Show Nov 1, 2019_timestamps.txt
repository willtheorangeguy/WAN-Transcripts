Here's the thing about the whole "Watching in 1.5X speed and leaving reviews." 

You will have people who have not watched these series leaving reviews. You will have people who only caught a glimpse or seen a scene that they, without following the entire story, witness and leave a review because they didn't like it or it made them feel uncomfortable or whatever the case may be.

This concept of harping on people who watch a series in 1.5X as if people with skewed visions of "art" didn't already exist and populate review boards and sites is insanity. 

No business or person has a right to tell you how you should enjoy your content. And you cannot force people to view something "The right way" or "as the director intended" because as human beings we are going to have completely different views. Besides, most directors these days have to have the audience filling in information and writing the story FOR them due to lazy writing and acting (Force awakens. Last Jedi. Solo, anyone?) so for an actor or director to stand up and say "You should watch it the way I want you to watch it, and you should experience THESE EXACT emotions at THESE TIMESTAMPS." is, again, insanity. 

When you make a painting, you cannot stop someone from insulting your painting. Nor can you stop someone from seeing your painting in a different way than you seen it. Art isn't static. It's a means of conveying a story. How different people interpret the same piece is how it was in the past, is currently, and will be in the future.

Imagine telling someone that they're "Playing a game wrong" because they didn't do what you would have done. Same concept.
