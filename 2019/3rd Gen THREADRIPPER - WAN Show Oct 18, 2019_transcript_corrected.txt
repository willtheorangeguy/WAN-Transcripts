[0.00 → 1.12] I think the title is still...
[1.12 → 1.62] Alright!
[1.62 → 2.62] The title is still Pixel.
[2.62 → 3.62] Sweet.
[3.62 → 4.62] Uh...
[4.62 → 5.62] Oh, crap.
[5.62 → 6.62] Really?
[6.62 → 7.62] Uh-oh.
[7.62 → 9.62] Well, okay then.
[9.62 → 13.62] Third gen Thread ripper!
[13.62 → 14.62] To be clear.
[14.62 → 20.00] Welcome to the Land Show, ladies and gentlemen.
[20.00 → 23.40] It's not new news, which is why I didn't originally put it in the title.
[23.40 → 24.40] That's fine.
[24.40 → 25.40] We haven't talked about it yet.
[25.40 → 26.40] Yeah, we have.
[26.40 → 27.40] What?
[27.40 → 28.40] I thought there are more details.
[28.40 → 30.40] Just that it's like, coming.
[30.40 → 31.40] Yeah!
[31.40 → 32.40] Okay.
[32.40 → 33.40] Good enough.
[33.40 → 34.40] Alright.
[34.40 → 35.40] Sounds good.
[35.40 → 36.40] We're talking about Thread ripper.
[36.40 → 37.40] We're going to have a great show for you guys today.
[37.40 → 38.40] I'm sorry that I...
[38.40 → 40.40] Wait, what on earth is this?
[40.40 → 41.40] Get...
[41.40 → 42.40] What is this text here?
[42.40 → 44.40] Yeah, I want to remove the text.
[44.40 → 45.40] Alright!
[45.40 → 46.40] Whew!
[46.40 → 50.40] I have genuinely no idea how that got there.
[50.40 → 53.40] What a week it has been, ladies and gentlemen.
[53.40 → 55.40] Do you want to talk about why you're wearing this?
[55.40 → 57.40] I would love to.
[57.40 → 60.40] I can't give too many details.
[60.40 → 63.40] Because it's one of those things that is like a...
[63.40 → 67.40] It's like an hoofbound embargo.
[67.40 → 68.40] No.
[68.40 → 71.40] Like, there's no actual non-disclosure agreement, but it's kinda like...
[71.40 → 74.40] But you know that if you broke it, you'd be a jerk.
[74.40 → 76.40] Yeah, I'd be a total butthead.
[76.40 → 77.40] Yeah, okay.
[77.40 → 82.40] Um, what I can say is that it involved a high-powered potato cannon...
[82.40 → 83.40] Okay.
[83.40 → 88.40] ...and an exploding watermelon, and saving the environment.
[88.40 → 89.40] Nice!
[89.40 → 90.40] Nice!
[90.40 → 91.40] Nice!
[91.40 → 92.40] Nice!
[92.40 → 93.40] It's nice!
[93.40 → 94.40] Nice!
[94.40 → 95.40] The one that's been made.
[95.40 → 96.40] Yeah, it's been a commercial.
[96.40 → 97.40] Not a commercial, I guess.
[97.40 → 98.40] A PSA of sorts, recently.
[98.40 → 100.40] That I think the guy kept looking at his watch while he was playing a soccer match.
[100.40 → 104.40] And then it was like, every 30 seconds, the Rainforest loses an entire soccer field worth of...
[104.40 → 105.40] So, I was like, wow!
[105.40 → 106.40] Yeah, that sucks!
[106.40 → 107.40] Yeah.
[107.40 → 108.40] Cool!
[108.40 → 109.40] Pretty much blows!
[109.40 → 110.40] Um...
[110.40 → 111.40] There's other news.
[111.40 → 115.40] More Blizzard stuff, so I'm sure that'll be absolutely fantastic.
[115.40 → 117.40] Uh, also, something else.
[117.40 → 121.40] Riot Games is announcing, like, everything.
[121.40 → 127.40] A mobile game called Wild Rift, a hero shooter called Project A, a top-down MMO called Project
[127.40 → 134.40] F, a card game called Legends of Runeterra, an animated series, and an esports Manager or
[134.40 → 135.40] something.
[135.40 → 137.40] LOL esports Manager.
[137.40 → 138.40] Just every game.
[138.40 → 139.40] Wait, was that a pun?
[139.40 → 140.40] LOL esports Manager.
[140.40 → 141.40] Ahhhhh!
[141.40 → 148.40] I think the esports Manager thing is supposed to be like the FIFA Manager games.
[148.40 → 149.40] Really?
[149.40 → 150.40] But I haven't...
[150.40 → 153.40] That's the smartest thing I've ever heard!
[153.40 → 157.40] That's purely just based on looking at the name in the text doc.
[157.40 → 160.40] I haven't looked into it at all, so I could be aggressively wrong.
[160.40 → 162.40] Now is, like, the right time to do something like that.
[162.40 → 163.40] It seems like it.
[163.40 → 164.40] Yeah.
[164.40 → 166.40] So, they're just trying to make every game on the planet.
[166.40 → 172.40] It sounds like a company owned 100% by Tencent is trying to go after companies not 100% owned by Tencent.
[172.40 → 174.40] Only partially owned by Tencent.
[174.40 → 175.40] Sweet!
[175.40 → 176.40] Sounds like an interesting move.
[176.40 → 182.40] In other news, third gen Thread ripper and the Ry zen 9 3950X are coming soon.
[182.40 → 184.40] We never actually said that, so we'll talk about that pretty shortly.
[184.40 → 185.40] That's fine.
[185.40 → 191.40] And I think I'm allowed to talk to you guys about this, but if I'm not, Nick isn't here to tell me no.
[191.40 → 192.40] Oh.
[192.40 → 194.40] He's not in the office today.
[194.40 → 195.40] Oh, Nick, I'm so sorry.
[195.40 → 198.40] And I am silencing my phone right now.
[198.40 → 199.40] Oh.
[199.40 → 200.40] Oh no.
[200.40 → 201.40] Oh no, what just happened?
[201.40 → 202.40] That's some confidence.
[202.40 → 203.40] That's some confidence.
[203.40 → 204.40] That's some confidence.
[204.40 → 206.40] So, we did a pretty epic collab this week.
[206.40 → 207.40] Oh!
[207.40 → 210.40] I don't know if you've been keeping track of what's been shaken.
[210.40 → 212.40] Well, I think it was pretty obvious with the Twitter post.
[212.40 → 213.40] Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[213.40 → 214.40] The two of them.
[214.40 → 216.40] So, Mr. Grimm's.
[216.40 → 217.40] Yep.
[217.40 → 220.40] Corey from the Washington, oh, I forget.
[220.40 → 222.40] The Washington Overwatch team.
[222.40 → 224.40] Corey underscore OW on Twitter.
[224.40 → 225.40] Yeah.
[225.40 → 226.40] Pretty cool kid.
[226.40 → 228.40] Shroud was there.
[228.40 → 230.40] Paul's hardware was there.
[230.40 → 232.40] And you were there.
[232.40 → 233.40] And you were there.
[233.40 → 234.40] And you were there.
[234.40 → 235.40] And you were...
[235.40 → 236.40] It's a Wizard of Oz thing.
[236.40 → 237.40] And you're all there.
[237.40 → 238.40] Through the camera.
[238.40 → 239.40] Yeah, you're all there.
[239.40 → 240.40] So, I...
[240.40 → 241.40] Yeah, it's amazing.
[241.40 → 243.40] I just want to talk a little bit about the experience of shooting it.
[243.40 → 250.40] The video's probably not coming for at least two or three weeks just because there is so much footage.
[250.40 → 251.40] Like, I'm going to have...
[251.40 → 252.40] The arena looks amazing.
[252.40 → 255.40] I'm going to have an editor doing nothing but that for at least two weeks solid.
[255.40 → 256.40] It's sponsored by NVIDIA.
[256.40 → 259.40] So, they're going to want to take a look at it before it goes up.
[259.40 → 260.40] But it'll be coming.
[260.40 → 261.40] It's going to be awesome.
[261.40 → 262.40] First, let's hit that intro.
[262.40 → 263.40] Really cool.
[263.40 → 264.40] Very cool.
[264.40 → 266.40] Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.
[266.40 → 267.40] Ma, ma, ma.
[267.40 → 268.40] Bye.
[268.40 → 269.40] Oh.
[269.40 → 272.40] Oh, I love that.
[272.40 → 274.40] Oh, I love that.
[274.40 → 275.40] Oh, I love that.
[275.40 → 276.40] I love that.
[276.40 → 277.40] I love that.
[277.40 → 278.40] I love that.
[278.40 → 279.40] I love that.
[279.40 → 280.40] I love that.
[280.40 → 281.40] I love that.
[281.40 → 282.40] I love that.
[282.40 → 283.40] I love that.
[283.40 → 284.40] I love that.
[284.40 → 285.40] I love that.
[285.40 → 286.40] I love that.
[286.40 → 287.40] Yeah.
[287.40 → 288.40] Oh, that from last week.
[288.40 → 289.40] Yeah.
[289.40 → 290.40] Oh, that.
[290.40 → 291.40] Ah.
[291.40 → 292.40] There's, yeah, there's really...
[292.40 → 293.40] Didn't think about that at all.
[293.40 → 295.40] There's really no way we can fix that, is there?
[295.40 → 296.40] No, we just have to...
[296.40 → 297.40] Oh, shit.
[297.40 → 298.40] Offline online.
[298.40 → 299.40] Yeah, sorry.
[299.40 → 301.40] I don't think we can do that.
[301.40 → 302.40] Um...
[302.40 → 303.40] That sucks.
[303.40 → 304.40] Okay.
[304.40 → 305.40] Uh, sorry guys.
[305.40 → 307.40] I pressed the wrong button.
[307.40 → 310.40] And so we're only live on YouTube right now.
[310.40 → 312.40] Um, very sorry.
[312.40 → 320.40] The only way I can fix it is by going off YouTube and then back on all of them, and we really can't disrupt our streams any more than we absolutely have to.
[320.40 → 326.40] Um, we had quite a few people suggesting that last stream was turned off on purpose.
[326.40 → 327.40] No.
[327.40 → 333.40] I saw some great conspiracy theories about me being on my phone and like sending a message to kill the stream.
[333.40 → 335.40] Guys, if I wanted to kill the stream, the button is right here.
[335.40 → 336.40] I don't actually...
[336.40 → 338.40] We don't have a producer.
[338.40 → 339.40] Yeah, no.
[339.40 → 343.40] So there's a stream PC right off, right off the screen.
[343.40 → 344.40] Yeah.
[344.40 → 345.40] It's literally right there.
[345.40 → 347.40] Nobody else has a way to turn off the WAN show.
[347.40 → 348.40] No.
[348.40 → 349.40] Really.
[349.40 → 351.40] Unless they were to go into the server room and yank the Ethernet cable.
[351.40 → 352.40] Or like pull power here.
[352.40 → 353.40] Yeah.
[353.40 → 355.40] Even if they pull power, we're on a UPS.
[355.40 → 356.40] Oh, get owned.
[356.40 → 358.40] No, they would have to go to the back of our power supply.
[358.40 → 360.40] They'd have to be right here.
[360.40 → 364.40] Um, which conceivably they could have been, but I wouldn't have had to text them at that point.
[364.40 → 365.40] Yeah, yeah.
[365.40 → 367.40] Anyway, great news for you guys.
[367.40 → 372.40] This week, third gen Thread ripper and the Ry zen 9 3950X are coming soon.
[372.40 → 375.40] The leaks are starting to really accelerate.
[375.40 → 376.40] Yeah.
[376.40 → 380.40] In fact, I think it was, was it AS Rock that leaked a board or MSI?
[380.40 → 382.40] I'm just trying to remember which one it was.
[382.40 → 391.40] Also a source from, not boards, but a source from inside AMD provided internal documents listing the announcement and release date for third gen Thread ripper CPUs.
[391.40 → 401.40] The 3960X, 3970X, 3990X, and the TR40 motherboards will apparently be announced November 5th with availability November 19th.
[401.40 → 402.40] Sexy.
[402.40 → 403.40] Dang.
[403.40 → 415.40] Rumours point to the 3960X with 24 cores, 3970X with 32 cores, and 3980X with 48 cores, and 3990X with 64 cores.
[415.40 → 421.40] I'm thinking it would be hilarious if I waited two more generations to upgrade my processor.
[421.40 → 422.40] And then I upgraded.
[422.40 → 423.40] And then I upgraded.
[423.40 → 424.40] And then I upgraded.
[424.40 → 425.40] And then I upgraded.
[425.40 → 432.40] I upgraded from a 5960X to a 5960X.
[432.40 → 435.40] I actually think that would be hilarious.
[435.40 → 438.40] Oh, man.
[438.40 → 441.40] I mean, there have been other times when you could do just such a thing.
[441.40 → 448.40] If you held onto your GeForce GTX 480 or 580, you could have then upgraded to a Radeon RX 480 or 580.
[448.40 → 449.40] Yeah.
[449.40 → 451.40] What are some other great examples of that?
[451.40 → 453.40] Just trying to think.
[453.40 → 456.40] There's definitely been a few, but there hasn't been like a ton.
[456.40 → 457.40] Doesn't happen that often.
[457.40 → 462.40] Especially when it would be a somewhat reasonable upgrade.
[462.40 → 463.40] Mm-hmm.
[463.40 → 464.40] You know what I mean?
[464.40 → 466.40] Like the 5960X is still fine.
[466.40 → 470.40] And in two generations it'll probably still be sort of fine.
[470.40 → 474.40] So WCCF Tech has pictures of, where is it?
[474.40 → 477.40] No, apparently WCCF Tech doesn't have that.
[477.40 → 478.40] Hold on a second.
[478.40 → 479.40] Dang it.
[479.40 → 482.40] Where's that MSI motherboard that I'm looking for?
[482.40 → 483.40] MSI leaks new thing.
[483.40 → 484.40] I will try to help you look.
[484.40 → 485.40] Here it is.
[485.40 → 486.40] Woo!
[486.40 → 487.40] Wait a minute.
[487.40 → 488.40] What the crap?
[488.40 → 489.40] That's not an MSI board.
[489.40 → 491.40] That's just a motherboard.
[491.40 → 493.40] What is with this clickbait?
[493.40 → 494.40] Look at this.
[494.40 → 497.40] Look at this horrible thing.
[497.40 → 499.40] MSI leaks new AMD Thread ripper.
[499.40 → 500.40] That's an ASUS board.
[500.40 → 501.40] Yeah, like obviously.
[501.40 → 504.40] What are you even talking about?
[504.40 → 505.40] Is this?
[505.40 → 508.40] Where is the stupid picture of it?
[508.40 → 512.40] Have you been to Tom's yet?
[512.40 → 513.40] I'm looking there.
[513.40 → 514.40] Whatever.
[514.40 → 515.40] It doesn't matter.
[515.40 → 519.40] Okay, so let's have a look at what specs there are available.
[519.40 → 530.40] So yeah, so this is honestly, this is pretty darn exciting because up to 64 cores on an HDDT platform.
[530.40 → 534.40] And given the pricing that we've seen before on Thread ripper, I mean even the-
[534.40 → 535.40] High-end desktop.
[535.40 → 536.40] Oh, sorry, yeah.
[536.40 → 537.40] HDDT is high-end desktop.
[537.40 → 543.40] So that's Intel's LGA 2011, 2066, like their higher pin count sockets.
[543.40 → 546.40] And then same thing for AMD, the bigger higher pin count socket.
[546.40 → 557.40] So your Ry zen is on AMD's like consumer socket or mainstream socket and then Thread ripper, well, Ry zen Thread ripper I guess, is on your HDDT or high-end desktop socket.
[557.40 → 562.40] And the HDDT is sort of a weird gray area.
[562.40 → 566.40] Intel recently tried to kind of separate it from workstation.
[566.40 → 568.40] They did a separate C600 series chipset.
[568.40 → 572.40] They did separate Leon workstation chips for it.
[572.40 → 578.40] No one cared because they were basically the same thing as the Core i's with ECC.
[578.40 → 582.40] And then on the AMD side, they include ECC support with all their chips anyway.
[582.40 → 588.40] So there would be no differentiation whatsoever between an HDDT and a workstation platform.
[588.40 → 592.40] So Thread ripper is essentially the workstation platform.
[592.40 → 602.40] It's just a matter of whether you buy a board that has more workstation-oriented features like faster onboard networking or support for, you know, SaaS drives or whatever the case may be.
[602.40 → 606.40] I don't know. I don't think anyone cares about that anymore now that it's a NVMe is a thing.
[606.40 → 608.40] But I think you guys get my point.
[608.40 → 614.40] Whereas you would buy a gamer or consumer-centric one if you wanted to game or do consumer-y stuff.
[614.40 → 616.40] This would be... sorry.
[616.40 → 618.40] If you wanted to game though, I think Thread ripper is...
[618.40 → 620.40] Of dubious...
[620.40 → 621.40] Not the right direction.
[621.40 → 622.40] ...dubious value.
[622.40 → 626.40] This is probably almost assuredly way too much work.
[626.40 → 630.40] But like, you know how you did Systems Through the Ages at the last LTX?
[630.40 → 634.40] Doing like server setups would be really cool.
[634.40 → 636.40] That would be cool if you're into that sort of thing.
[636.40 → 638.40] Yeah, probably not for almost anyone there.
[638.40 → 640.40] And it would be way too much work.
[640.40 → 641.40] But I would love it.
[641.40 → 642.40] Yeah.
[642.40 → 643.40] I'm sure you would.
[643.40 → 653.40] Okay, is that more or less... no, I guess the Ry zen 9 3950X is expected to launch in November as well.
[653.40 → 655.40] But I don't think that was specifically detailed.
[655.40 → 657.40] So here's the big conversation.
[657.40 → 663.40] Intel recently hit back with their 10 series HEAT chips.
[663.40 → 664.40] Yeah.
[664.40 → 666.40] Which was essentially a price cut.
[666.40 → 667.40] Yeah.
[667.40 → 671.40] I mean, it's been a long time since Intel has actually responded to anything AMD's done.
[671.40 → 673.40] But now they are.
[673.40 → 678.40] So I guess the question here is, is Intel in trouble?
[678.40 → 685.40] Because we're sitting here, AMD launched their third gen Ry zen up to 12 cores.
[685.40 → 686.40] Yeah.
[686.40 → 688.40] Intel already had to respond.
[688.40 → 693.40] Now AMD is following up with third gen based Thread ripper.
[693.40 → 704.40] And I don't think there's anything in Intel's lineup that is even... that is going to do anything but embarrass them on a graph.
[704.40 → 705.40] You know?
[705.40 → 706.40] Because that's how people shop, right?
[706.40 → 708.40] Like, oh, who has the best CPU right now?
[708.40 → 709.40] Yeah.
[709.40 → 712.40] So you look up, you know, a Cine bench graph or whatever the case may be.
[712.40 → 720.40] And Intel made an argument that Cine bench is kind of overrated as a benchmark since it's not representative of what a lot of people are doing with their computers.
[720.40 → 721.40] And I, you know, I see your point.
[721.40 → 722.40] Yeah.
[722.40 → 726.40] But that's how a lot of people determine, okay, who makes the best CPU in the world?
[726.40 → 731.40] And a lot of people buy a lower end product based on who makes the best one.
[731.40 → 732.40] Yeah.
[732.40 → 735.40] I think that's fairly standard, actually.
[735.40 → 736.40] They are losing market share.
[736.40 → 737.40] They are.
[737.40 → 740.40] And so I think they're obviously in trouble.
[740.40 → 742.40] I think they've been in trouble for a while.
[742.40 → 744.40] I don't by any means think they're drowning.
[744.40 → 751.40] But I think they're losing mind share, which is something they had pretty strongly, say, four years ago.
[751.40 → 755.40] Well, I mean, there's two, okay, there are two different ways to look at mind share.
[755.40 → 759.40] I think they had mind share in the way that you're talking about.
[759.40 → 760.40] Yeah.
[760.40 → 761.40] I think.
[761.40 → 763.40] Where it's like, I need to buy a gaming CPU.
[763.40 → 765.40] Who makes great gaming CPUs?
[765.40 → 766.40] Intel.
[766.40 → 770.40] But the kind of, there's another kind of mind share that I want to bring up.
[770.40 → 774.40] And that's the that's the goodwill mind share.
[774.40 → 775.40] Okay.
[775.40 → 776.40] Like, I don't think Intel.
[776.40 → 777.40] So who not Blizzard?
[777.40 → 778.40] Has a.
[778.40 → 779.40] Sorry.
[779.40 → 780.40] Let's keep going.
[780.40 → 784.40] I don't think Intel has a ton of goodwill in the community.
[784.40 → 785.40] Yeah.
[785.40 → 793.40] So imagine for a second, if Intel had been on top for a long time and had been kind of like a benevolent,
[793.40 → 805.40] a benevolent force, you know, granting technology, new technologies to us at a rate that we felt like was as fast as they could possibly do it.
[805.40 → 815.40] I mean, I got really annoyed actually, when I found out that Intel has a super low cost integrated networking chip.
[815.40 → 818.40] Or I shouldn't say an integrated networking chip.
[818.40 → 820.40] It's a little bit more complicated than that.
[820.40 → 831.40] So it's an outboard networking chip that goes on the motherboard, but that integrates with features that are present on the CPU in order to make the solution very, very cost-effective.
[831.40 → 837.40] So basically there are two different ways that you can put an Intel NIC or network interface card on your motherboard.
[837.40 → 839.40] You can buy a complete standalone one.
[839.40 → 840.40] That's more expensive.
[840.40 → 841.40] Yeah.
[841.40 → 847.40] Or you can leverage some of the technology that's already on the CPU, which is obviously not an option if your name isn't Intel.
[847.40 → 849.40] And then you can put a super cheap one on.
[849.40 → 850.40] So I found out.
[850.40 → 852.40] And you're talking like physically on a board.
[852.40 → 853.40] Yeah.
[853.40 → 854.40] Because you're not talking about adding cards right now.
[854.40 → 855.40] That's right.
[855.40 → 856.40] Yeah.
[856.40 → 858.40] So I mean like a figurative NIC.
[858.40 → 859.40] Like a face port.
[859.40 → 860.40] I was just more clarifying.
[860.40 → 861.40] Yeah.
[861.40 → 875.40] So what I found out is that the upcoming boards for their 10 series HDDT chips are going to have for as little as I think it's about $2.70 bomb cost are going to have multi gigabit networking.
[875.40 → 876.40] Oh, damn.
[876.40 → 877.40] Okay.
[877.40 → 880.40] But they've had this, I'm assuming you're saying?
[880.40 → 889.40] If you can do it for $2.70 today, you probably could have done it for 10 bucks a few years ago.
[889.40 → 900.40] But instead, motherboard manufacturers who have wanted to integrate multi gigabit networking have been forced to buy chipsets that are upwards of $100, $150.
[900.40 → 904.40] I remember checking in with ASUS and this was, I think this was a couple of years ago now.
[904.40 → 914.40] But they were basically like, yeah, we might as well just build a 10 gig LAN card, put it in the box, and then you plug it into a PCI Express port if you want 10 gigs.
[914.40 → 919.40] Otherwise, I guess you can like to flip it on eBay compared to trying to integrate it onto the board.
[919.40 → 921.40] It was so cost prohibitive.
[921.40 → 926.40] And it's like, were there things happening in the industry that slowed that down?
[926.40 → 927.40] Yeah, for sure.
[927.40 → 940.40] The multi gigabit move took some time because 2.5 gig and 5 gig didn't really start seeing any support until probably the last one to three years, I guess.
[940.40 → 942.40] 10 gig was the standard before that.
[942.40 → 944.40] So the idea was we're going to go straight from 1 gig to 10 gig.
[944.40 → 950.40] But it was so cost prohibitive to do that, that they were like, okay, well, we should probably build some intermediary standards.
[950.40 → 953.40] Well, where was that ages ago?
[953.40 → 961.40] There's something to be said for its possible that they couldn't get like proper yields or whatever.
[961.40 → 965.40] And then by the time they're able to actually accomplish the thing, it was just automatically that cheap.
[965.40 → 967.40] But I don't think that's true in this case.
[967.40 → 970.40] Intel cheap 10 gigabit chip.
[970.40 → 972.40] I'm going to check.
[972.40 → 974.40] Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[974.40 → 978.40] Because sometimes they could have been working on this thing for a long time, but it wasn't production ready.
[978.40 → 982.40] And then they get it production ready, and might just jump right with it.
[982.40 → 983.40] Yeah, but the thing about-
[983.40 → 986.40] They have shown that they are not going to do that.
[986.40 → 987.40] Yeah.
[987.40 → 988.40] Many times.
[988.40 → 990.40] I mean, the thing about yields though, I mean, that's what I said though.
[990.40 → 994.40] It's like if you can do it for $2.70 today, you probably could have done it for-
[994.40 → 996.40] No, I know, but like maybe it was't-
[996.40 → 997.40] Even if you're yielded for one quarter.
[997.40 → 999.40] Maybe it wasn't production ready like almost at all.
[999.40 → 1000.40] I don't know.
[1000.40 → 1002.40] I'm saying it's possible.
[1002.40 → 1003.40] Yeah.
[1003.40 → 1007.40] I'm also saying that Intel has shown that they will not do that for years.
[1007.40 → 1008.40] Yep.
[1008.40 → 1011.40] And they will not release things and shelve things and all that kind of stuff.
[1011.40 → 1015.40] And like to me, the fact that there aren't other players in the industry supporting it,
[1015.40 → 1019.40] like 2.5 and 5 gig, shouldn't necessarily be an impediment.
[1019.40 → 1030.40] Because if you're Intel and you are literally making the interface chips, I mean, a D-Link or a Links or whatever can come to you, buy chips, make switches.
[1030.40 → 1031.40] Oh, wow.
[1031.40 → 1032.40] All of a sudden there's-
[1032.40 → 1034.40] You're kind of the party that needs to go first.
[1034.40 → 1035.40] An ecosystem for this.
[1035.40 → 1036.40] And so-
[1036.40 → 1041.40] You have to step up and make it so the consumers or enterprise or whatever is like, oh, I have this thing.
[1041.40 → 1043.40] I want to connect it into other things.
[1043.40 → 1046.40] That was a huge chunk of lag and that's super loud.
[1046.40 → 1047.40] Yeah.
[1047.40 → 1049.40] They can definitely hear that.
[1049.40 → 1052.40] So I want to connect this cool thing that I have to other stuff.
[1052.40 → 1053.40] It's probably Jake.
[1053.40 → 1054.40] Then that will- I wouldn't even be surprised.
[1054.40 → 1055.40] Have you heard his car?
[1055.40 → 1056.40] Yes.
[1056.40 → 1057.40] Sounds kind of like that.
[1057.40 → 1058.40] Yeah.
[1058.40 → 1064.40] And that will put pressure on companies like the D-Link or Trend Net or whatever you were just talking about, etc.
[1064.40 → 1065.40] Yeah.
[1065.40 → 1067.40] To support devices and everything else.
[1067.40 → 1068.40] So-
[1068.40 → 1073.40] If I had a computer that supported that, I would be driven to try to go get the networking hardware that also supports that.
[1073.40 → 1074.40] Absolutely.
[1074.40 → 1077.40] So back to the discussion of Mind share.
[1077.40 → 1090.40] If Intel had put themselves in a position where they had a technological advantage and also were seen as pushing things along as fast as they could, I don't think they'd be under any kind of threat right now whatsoever.
[1090.40 → 1107.40] Because the cold hard truth is that for enthusiasts and for gamers, outside some fairly uncommon use cases, let's face it, what percentage of you guys actually 3D model at home?
[1107.40 → 1110.40] And yeah, there's going to be a fair number of you.
[1110.40 → 1113.40] Probably a decent amount, but that decent amount is probably under 10%.
[1113.40 → 1115.40] And that's when show viewers.
[1115.40 → 1116.40] Yeah.
[1116.40 → 1118.40] That's not the public.
[1118.40 → 1119.40] Yeah.
[1119.40 → 1127.40] But the problem, so for people who just play video games or do light video editing, Intel is still in a very good position.
[1127.40 → 1134.40] I mean, Adobe Premiere is notoriously poorly optimized for multithreaded processors.
[1134.40 → 1135.40] So if you were to run out and buy...
[1135.40 → 1136.40] Oh, I thought you were just going to leave it there.
[1136.40 → 1137.40] I could have.
[1137.40 → 1138.40] Yeah.
[1138.40 → 1139.40] Yeah.
[1139.40 → 1146.40] So if you were going to run out and buy a 9900K or something like that, you're getting basically peak tier Adobe Premiere performance.
[1146.40 → 1151.40] The only difference is that now there's a second option.
[1151.40 → 1152.40] Yeah.
[1152.40 → 1156.40] And people are flocking to AMD because they're trying to send a message.
[1156.40 → 1157.40] So that's what I'm trying to say.
[1157.40 → 1162.40] On the one hand, they had mind share for like, Intel CPUs are great for gaming.
[1162.40 → 1164.40] And they still are!
[1164.40 → 1179.40] Intel isn't under fire by like a generations ahead technology like they were when AMD came at them with 64-bit or with dual-core and Intel had only single-core processors.
[1179.40 → 1182.40] This isn't quite like that.
[1182.40 → 1192.40] But because people are so tired of it, an option that comes along and performs even as well and oh, and it's a great value too.
[1192.40 → 1193.40] It's even cheaper.
[1193.40 → 1199.40] And Intel takes 6 to 12 months to adjust their pricing to match this threat that's so very obviously here.
[1199.40 → 1204.40] Like, if they just were like...
[1204.40 → 1207.40] I love so much of what they do.
[1207.40 → 1208.40] Yeah.
[1208.40 → 1211.40] They didn't have to give the Thunderbolt 3 spec to the USB forum.
[1211.40 → 1212.40] Yeah.
[1212.40 → 1213.40] USB 4 is going to be great.
[1213.40 → 1214.40] Yeah, that's a...
[1214.40 → 1215.40] Okay, that's a very good...
[1215.40 → 1216.40] Uh, okay.
[1216.40 → 1217.40] I like that.
[1217.40 → 1218.40] Intel does a lot of good.
[1218.40 → 1219.40] Yeah.
[1219.40 → 1220.40] I like...
[1220.40 → 1221.40] I want to root for them.
[1221.40 → 1223.40] That's a good like, insult sandwich.
[1223.40 → 1224.40] It's the opposite of compliment sandwich.
[1224.40 → 1225.40] Yeah, but...
[1225.40 → 1227.40] You just put a compliment in the middle instead of on each side.
[1227.40 → 1232.40] But they just do the most self-destructive thing!
[1232.40 → 1233.40] There it comes!
[1233.40 → 1234.40] It's like...
[1234.40 → 1235.40] Yeah.
[1235.40 → 1240.40] It's like if Intel designed a gun, the barrel would be made of lead.
[1240.40 → 1243.40] Because they only know how to aim in one direction!
[1243.40 → 1245.40] Brr, brr, brr!
[1245.40 → 1247.40] Like, I just...
[1247.40 → 1250.40] Something that I've been saying for a long time...
[1250.40 → 1251.40] Um...
[1251.40 → 1256.40] And like, I've talked to people at Intel about this, and I understand their stance, and it...
[1256.40 → 1259.40] I totally get it on paper.
[1259.40 → 1262.40] But Intel doesn't show up to conventions anymore.
[1262.40 → 1264.40] I know, right?
[1264.40 → 1265.40] And that I've...
[1265.40 → 1266.40] I've...
[1266.40 → 1276.40] I can't go into it, but I've talked to people at Intel about this, and they have their very
[1276.40 → 1277.40] legitimate reasons.
[1277.40 → 1279.40] I will say that much.
[1279.40 → 1282.40] But I think they're really missing something.
[1282.40 → 1290.40] Which is when you walk around a PAX, and you see a gigantic AMD booth that's just popping.
[1290.40 → 1294.40] There are tons of people there, there's stuff going on, people are really excited.
[1294.40 → 1297.40] And Intel just isn't around?
[1297.40 → 1303.40] For the enthusiast community that like, really cares, that's a really weird message.
[1303.40 → 1304.40] Yeah, it looks bad.
[1304.40 → 1306.40] It looks terrible.
[1306.40 → 1308.40] Like, really, terrible.
[1308.40 → 1310.40] And there's like, I'm sure it's...
[1310.40 → 1314.40] With that said, Intel showed up for LTX, so I'm just saying maybe PAX is...
[1314.40 → 1315.40] Yeah, I think...
[1315.40 → 1316.40] Maybe PAX is the problem.
[1316.40 → 1319.40] I think they could've shown up more.
[1319.40 → 1320.40] I think they...
[1320.40 → 1323.40] I'm not part of LTX, I'm not even part of LTT, so I can throw that bomb.
[1323.40 → 1324.40] You know what?
[1324.40 → 1325.40] Nick and Colton aren't here to yell at me.
[1325.40 → 1329.40] Intel knows they could've shown up more, and I believe the plan is to show up more next year.
[1329.40 → 1330.40] Okay.
[1330.40 → 1331.40] But like, they should be.
[1331.40 → 1335.40] And they should be showing up more to LTX, they should be showing up more to other conventions.
[1335.40 → 1337.40] And I get that from like...
[1337.40 → 1338.40] Yeah.
[1338.40 → 1343.40] Okay, from a computer hardware standpoint, going to an LTX, again, I'm separate from all this,
[1343.40 → 1346.40] going to an LTX makes way more sense than going to a PAX, because you have...
[1346.40 → 1347.40] Yeah.
[1347.40 → 1352.40] Your target audience is like 100% of the attendees compared to...
[1352.40 → 1353.40] LTX is...
[1353.40 → 1354.40] A relatively small percentage.
[1354.40 → 1355.40] Laser focused.
[1355.40 → 1356.40] Yes.
[1356.40 → 1357.40] Yeah.
[1357.40 → 1358.40] Tech enthusiasts.
[1358.40 → 1359.40] So totally, but that's a pretty easy thing to just accept.
[1359.40 → 1363.40] The PAX argument and the other conventions' argument, you should still be there.
[1363.40 → 1367.90] Not because it necessarily has a huge ROI, but because your competition is just laughing
[1367.90 → 1370.40] at you while they are there.
[1370.40 → 1372.40] And that's really weird.
[1372.40 → 1376.40] So, back to Mind share.
[1376.40 → 1379.40] That's a way that they're losing Mind share in both ways.
[1379.40 → 1380.40] Yeah.
[1380.40 → 1384.40] They're losing Mind share in the sense that they're just losing that association with gaming,
[1384.40 → 1385.40] which has been so strong for them.
[1385.40 → 1386.40] Yeah.
[1386.40 → 1387.40] And the thing is like...
[1387.40 → 1388.40] Ugh.
[1388.40 → 1392.90] Buy a Core i5 was like the answer to gaming computers for so long.
[1392.90 → 1393.40] I know.
[1393.40 → 1394.40] I know.
[1394.40 → 1397.40] And the thing about gaming is that not everyone plays games.
[1397.40 → 1398.40] Yeah.
[1398.40 → 1402.40] But gamers are really passionate, and they talk to other people.
[1402.40 → 1406.40] And when you have a product that's great for gaming and oh, by the way, it's also great
[1406.40 → 1411.40] for photo editing and video editing and light 3D rendering.
[1411.40 → 1414.40] Well, that's a winning combination.
[1414.40 → 1419.40] And there's also like if a gamer buys a system and then their family needs a computer or something
[1419.40 → 1420.40] like that.
[1420.40 → 1421.40] Or they grow up.
[1421.40 → 1422.40] Or they grow up.
[1422.40 → 1423.40] And get a job and need a computer for that.
[1423.40 → 1424.40] And need to do other stuff.
[1424.40 → 1425.40] Or whatever.
[1425.40 → 1426.40] Sure.
[1426.40 → 1428.40] They'll probably go, well, I had a good experience with that thing.
[1428.40 → 1434.40] It never lagged outside of anything other than like maybe some super intense moment in
[1434.40 → 1436.40] a game or something like that.
[1436.40 → 1439.40] I want to use that thing still.
[1439.40 → 1443.90] Like I've even observed something where gamers will build computers for their non-gamer
[1443.90 → 1449.40] friends and kind of secretly kind of make sure that it's like pretty solid if that person
[1449.40 → 1450.40] ever wants to join them in a game.
[1450.40 → 1451.40] Yeah.
[1451.40 → 1452.40] I've seen that many times.
[1452.40 → 1453.40] I've done that.
[1453.40 → 1454.40] Yeah.
[1454.40 → 1455.40] Because you're like, well, I want to.
[1455.40 → 1456.40] And the thing.
[1456.40 → 1457.40] Okay.
[1457.40 → 1458.40] The thing about that.
[1458.40 → 1460.40] I just want to justify that for a minute.
[1460.40 → 1462.40] Do they really need a decent graphics card?
[1462.40 → 1463.40] Okay.
[1463.40 → 1464.40] Hold on.
[1464.40 → 1467.40] So we've talked about how an entry level graphics card is a bad deal.
[1467.40 → 1468.40] Yes.
[1468.40 → 1472.40] Because you get like, you know, 10 FPS per dollar or whatever.
[1472.40 → 1474.40] Or like one FPS per dollar.
[1474.40 → 1475.40] Yeah.
[1475.40 → 1479.40] And then one that's like twice as much, you might get five or ten times the performance.
[1479.40 → 1482.40] So really you're doing them a favour.
[1482.40 → 1485.40] And graphics cards are used for more than just gaming now.
[1485.40 → 1486.40] Yes.
[1486.40 → 1487.40] Yeah.
[1487.40 → 1488.40] And there's really cool things you can do with computers.
[1488.40 → 1493.40] So even if they're not into games at all, there's very likely something else on a computer
[1493.40 → 1494.40] that they would be into.
[1494.40 → 1495.40] Exactly.
[1495.40 → 1499.40] Whether that's CAD modelling or photo editing or whatever.
[1499.40 → 1501.40] So is Intel in trouble?
[1501.40 → 1506.40] They have a public relations problem on their hands.
[1506.40 → 1507.40] Yes.
[1507.40 → 1509.40] I don't think the technology is actually the issue.
[1509.40 → 1510.40] They have time.
[1510.40 → 1518.40] It took AMD this long to basically like, they're still fighting against freaking Haswell basically.
[1518.40 → 1525.40] Like, it's not like, yes, yes, AMD is now on parish with Intel's latest technology.
[1525.40 → 1532.40] But Intel's technology three or four years ago was also basically on par with Intel's technology.
[1532.40 → 1533.40] Intel's technology.
[1533.40 → 1535.40] It's like, yeah, go AMD.
[1535.40 → 1539.40] But also like, this was really Intel's race to lose.
[1539.40 → 1546.40] And I think they're going to come back strong now that they've got the right motivation, which is, oh, wow, we have an actual competitor.
[1546.40 → 1547.40] They're going to figure that out.
[1547.40 → 1550.40] I'm not worried about them in the long term.
[1550.40 → 1552.40] They're going to come back strong from this, whatever.
[1552.40 → 1553.40] It's fine.
[1553.40 → 1558.40] What we want, I think I can talk to both of us here, is for both of them to be as strong as possible.
[1558.40 → 1559.40] Absolutely.
[1559.40 → 1562.40] Because that's going to drive the industry forward as fast as possible.
[1562.40 → 1566.40] So Intel's problem then is one of perception.
[1566.40 → 1567.40] And I've told them this before.
[1567.40 → 1571.40] I've told representatives that I was like, look, you guys got to be more human.
[1571.40 → 1572.40] Yeah.
[1572.40 → 1584.40] You can't just like, you can't be the scary corporate monster that, you know, your legal department won't sign off on any behaviour other than that.
[1584.40 → 1586.40] Like, they got to chillax.
[1586.40 → 1588.40] You got to have a personality.
[1588.40 → 1592.40] You got to really get out there in person and talk to people and like be cool.
[1592.40 → 1594.40] I understand the ROI doesn't work.
[1594.40 → 1595.40] I get it.
[1595.40 → 1596.40] Just do it.
[1596.40 → 1598.40] Oh yeah, the ROI of live activations.
[1598.40 → 1599.40] They're terrible.
[1599.40 → 1600.40] Terrible.
[1600.40 → 1601.40] It's horrible.
[1601.40 → 1602.40] It's a total waste of time.
[1602.40 → 1606.40] But, imperceptibly, it's still a huge deal.
[1606.40 → 1611.40] Because I honestly, straight up, I think the biggest problem with them not being at a convention is that AMD is.
[1611.40 → 1612.40] Yep.
[1612.40 → 1613.40] Oh yeah, for sure.
[1613.40 → 1614.40] If AMD wasn't there, it wouldn't matter.
[1614.40 → 1615.40] It wouldn't really matter.
[1615.40 → 1616.40] Nope.
[1616.40 → 1617.40] You're right.
[1617.40 → 1618.40] All right.
[1618.40 → 1629.40] Speaking of things that wouldn't really matter, if I were to explain this as clearly as I possibly can and make my position just absolutely crystal clear, it wouldn't matter.
[1629.40 → 1633.40] A good percentage of you would find a way to misinterpret it anyway.
[1633.40 → 1635.40] So I'm just going to stick to my notes here.
[1635.40 → 1636.40] Yeah.
[1636.40 → 1637.40] Title.
[1637.40 → 1641.40] Blizzard pulls out of launch event for Overwatch on Switch.
[1641.40 → 1644.40] Bans more pro Hong Kong Hearthstone players.
[1644.40 → 1647.40] Senators call out censorship.
[1647.40 → 1654.40] The sources are Ars Technica, Kodak, The Verge, and IGN.
[1654.40 → 1656.40] 10 out of 10.
[1656.40 → 1663.40] Blizzard cancelled the planned New York launch of Overwatch on Switch, apparently blind siding Nintendo with the news.
[1663.40 → 1671.40] It is believed Blizzard was trying to avoid unrest from fans upset with the company's ban of Hearthstone player Blitzkrieg.
[1671.40 → 1677.40] But it doesn't help that performance of the Switch port of Overwatch is pretty bad.
[1677.40 → 1687.40] This week, Blizzard banned three more Hearthstone players from a college team for holding up a free Hong Kong boycott Blitz sign while on a competition stream.
[1687.40 → 1690.40] A bipartisan group of congresspeople.
[1690.40 → 1691.40] Wow.
[1691.40 → 1693.40] That doesn't happen very often anymore.
[1693.40 → 1694.40] No.
[1694.40 → 1699.40] And senators have sent a letter to Blizzard expressing concern over the company's recent actions.
[1699.40 → 1703.40] Can Blizzard recover from this PR nightmare?
[1703.40 → 1707.40] Will Riot Games take over the niches currently occupied by Blizzard games?
[1707.40 → 1709.40] Fantastic job, newscaster.
[1709.40 → 1710.40] Thank you.
[1710.40 → 1711.40] And back to you.
[1712.40 → 1716.40] I, I, yeah, I don't actually think there's necessarily a ton to say about this.
[1716.40 → 1722.40] Um, yeah, I, I don't, I don't, I think they can recover from the PR nightmare.
[1722.40 → 1724.40] I think it's going to be a while.
[1724.40 → 1725.40] Are you going to wear red?
[1725.40 → 1726.40] Yes.
[1726.40 → 1728.40] You've even got a red shirt with you today.
[1728.40 → 1729.40] More orange, but yes.
[1729.40 → 1730.40] That's pretty red.
[1730.40 → 1731.40] Yeah.
[1731.40 → 1732.40] It's fairly red.
[1732.40 → 1733.40] Yeah.
[1733.40 → 1735.40] But you had to put on that, that Ram shirt for the WAN show.
[1735.40 → 1736.40] I did.
[1736.40 → 1737.40] Because LTTstore.com.
[1737.40 → 1739.40] But yes, I'm a hundred percent going to be wearing red.
[1739.40 → 1743.40] I've been debating, because I think this might actually get me kicked out.
[1743.40 → 1747.40] Getting shirts made that have the Blizzard logo and then the yellow stars.
[1747.40 → 1750.40] The Blizzard logo in red, or yellow, sorry.
[1750.40 → 1752.40] And then has the yellow stars around the end.
[1752.40 → 1755.40] I think that actually might get me kicked out.
[1755.40 → 1757.40] So I don't know if I'm going to go that far.
[1757.40 → 1759.40] How viral do you want to go, sir?
[1759.40 → 1763.40] I wouldn't wear it till the last day, but then hey, what, you know.
[1763.40 → 1764.40] Wear it till the last day.
[1764.40 → 1766.40] That might be the best idea.
[1766.40 → 1768.40] Then you can enjoy Blazon.
[1768.40 → 1769.40] I might get banned from Blazon.
[1769.40 → 1771.40] You might get banned from Blazon.
[1771.40 → 1776.40] I just have to make sure they don't know my account names.
[1776.40 → 1780.40] Speaking of LTTstore.com, hold that up for a second.
[1780.40 → 1785.40] If you had to guess, which would you say is more popular?
[1785.40 → 1787.40] The black and white, or the gold and black?
[1787.40 → 1788.40] If I had to guess.
[1788.40 → 1789.40] Yeah, yeah.
[1789.40 → 1790.40] You have to guess.
[1790.40 → 1792.40] Okay, so I have publicly said that I like this one more before.
[1792.40 → 1793.40] Yep.
[1793.40 → 1794.40] And I'm going to stand by that.
[1794.40 → 1795.40] You're going to stand by it.
[1795.40 → 1798.40] But the way you're wording this makes me think it is this one.
[1798.40 → 1799.40] Oh, I don't remember what you said.
[1799.40 → 1800.40] Okay.
[1800.40 → 1804.40] But I would say it's, if I hadn't heard you say anything, I would say it's this one.
[1804.40 → 1806.40] Because this is the one that I thought was going to sell more.
[1806.40 → 1807.40] That's the opposite thing.
[1807.40 → 1809.40] You just pointed at this one saying it was going to sell more.
[1809.40 → 1811.40] Because you worded it interestingly.
[1811.40 → 1814.40] Okay, just answer the question.
[1814.40 → 1815.40] This one.
[1815.40 → 1816.40] That one.
[1816.40 → 1817.40] Yeah.
[1817.40 → 1818.40] Okay, yeah, black and gold is doing about two to one.
[1818.40 → 1819.40] Yeah.
[1819.40 → 1820.40] I actually really like the white and black one personally.
[1820.40 → 1822.40] But we talked about this when we first announced them.
[1822.40 → 1825.40] We both said that this one got like more votes.
[1825.40 → 1826.40] But I like that one more.
[1826.40 → 1827.40] It just has such a Stormtrooper vibe.
[1827.40 → 1828.40] Yes.
[1828.40 → 1829.40] I love Stormtrooper colours.
[1829.40 → 1830.40] I really like it.
[1830.40 → 1831.40] Well, they're not really colours.
[1831.40 → 1832.40] They're more shades.
[1832.40 → 1833.40] Stormtrooper shades.
[1833.40 → 1834.40] Whatever, man.
[1834.40 → 1835.40] I went there.
[1835.40 → 1836.40] Wow.
[1836.40 → 1837.40] I pulled that grade three playground move.
[1837.40 → 1838.40] Wow.

[1896.40 → 1899.40] Okay, I shall do such a thing.
[1899.40 → 1900.40] Do you want me to do it?
[1900.40 → 1901.40] Uh, no, that's fine.
[1901.40 → 1902.40] I think I got it.
[1902.40 → 1903.40] Because then you can read?
[1903.40 → 1906.40] Oh, yeah, that would work fine, just fine.
[1906.40 → 1907.40] Fine, just fine.
[1907.40 → 1908.40] Do-do-do-do-do.
[1908.40 → 1909.40] That's fine.

[1935.40 → 1940.40] It features a fluid dynamic fan bearing, a fluid dynamic bearing fan.
[1940.40 → 1941.40] Yeah, there we go.
[1941.40 → 1947.40] And has premium hybrid fan control, which enables users to keep fan noise as low as possible.
[1947.40 → 1950.40] It's got micro-tolerance load regulation, extended hold-up time.
[1950.40 → 1952.40] I'm not sure what that last one means.
[1952.40 → 1953.40] And a 12-year warranty.
[1953.40 → 1954.40] I know what that means.
[1954.40 → 1957.40] That means you're not buying another power supply for over a decade if you pick up one of these.

[1966.40 → 1967.40] Heck yeah.
[1967.40 → 1972.40] Can I use this opportunity to talk about a really fun shoot that I was on this week?
[1972.40 → 1973.40] Yes, I think so.
[1973.40 → 1974.40] Are you going for the mojo?
[1974.40 → 1975.40] I think so.
[1975.40 → 1976.40] All right, you know what?
[1976.40 → 1979.40] I will tell you guys about the ghost pepper one.
[1979.40 → 1980.40] Should I have some ghost pepper today?
[1980.40 → 1981.40] Is it the max one?
[1981.40 → 1982.40] I'll do it if you do it.
[1982.40 → 1983.40] Ghost pepper buffalo sauce?
[1983.40 → 1984.40] Let's do it.
[1984.40 → 1985.40] You want to do a hot one today?
[1985.40 → 1986.40] Yeah.
[1986.40 → 1987.40] Let's do a hot one today.
[1987.40 → 1988.40] Yeah.
[1988.40 → 1989.40] All right.
[1989.40 → 1991.40] We're going ghost pepper today, ladies and gentlemen.
[1991.40 → 1993.40] Savage Jerky is handcrafted...oh, that smells good.
[1993.40 → 2002.40] In small batches and does not use nitrates or preservatives, resulting in an amazing jerky taste.
[2002.40 → 2003.40] They have 13 different flavours.
[2003.40 → 2004.40] Oh, I got a inner one.
[2004.40 → 2005.40] Oh, that's fine.
[2005.40 → 2006.40] I'll have the second one if it comes to that.
[2006.40 → 2015.40] They have 13 different flavours, from their sweet teriyaki to their intensely spicy Carolina
[2015.40 → 2016.40] Reaper.
[2016.40 → 2017.40] Well, that's got some kick.
[2017.40 → 2021.40] They also make hot sauces, barbecue sauces, and even spice rub.
[2021.40 → 2022.40] It's already going.
[2022.40 → 2023.40] Okay.
[2023.40 → 2024.40] Oh, wow.

[2030.40 → 2031.40] Mm-hmm.
[2031.40 → 2032.40] I love their hot sauces, by the way.
[2032.40 → 2033.40] Mm-hmm.
[2033.40 → 2034.40] I love their hot sauces, by the way.
[2034.40 → 2035.40] Some of the best hot sauces I've ever had.
[2035.40 → 2040.40] I think the hot sauces, don't take this the wrong way, Savage Jerky, but I think the hot
[2040.40 → 2041.40] sauces are actually better than the jerky.
[2041.40 → 2042.40] Yeah.
[2042.40 → 2043.40] They're perfect.
[2043.40 → 2045.40] The jerky's amazing, but yeah.
[2045.40 → 2046.40] That's spicy.
[2046.40 → 2048.40] You know what?
[2048.40 → 2057.40] Not as spicy as the Reaper chip that I almost had to eat on Tuesday.
[2057.40 → 2061.40] So are you familiar with pepper chips?
[2061.40 → 2062.40] Pepper chips?
[2062.40 → 2063.40] Okay.
[2063.40 → 2066.40] So it's not a potato chip.
[2066.40 → 2069.40] Like, normally a potato chip would-
[2069.40 → 2070.40] It's a chip made out of spicy peppers.
[2070.40 → 2071.40] Oh, yeah.
[2071.40 → 2072.40] Oh my God.
[2072.40 → 2073.40] No, I've never heard of that.
[2073.40 → 2074.40] So, um-
[2074.40 → 2075.40] Shoot.
[2075.40 → 2076.40] That sounds kind of terrifying.
[2076.40 → 2078.40] Am I allowed to talk about this?
[2078.40 → 2083.40] I'll talk about it a bit, but I won't say too much.
[2083.40 → 2084.40] I've done something like this.
[2084.40 → 2085.40] Which I've never heard of.
[2085.40 → 2086.40] I've never heard of it.
[2086.40 → 2087.40] Oh, no.
[2087.40 → 2088.40] I've never heard of it.
[2088.40 → 2089.40] Oh, no.
[2089.40 → 2090.40] It's a game.
[2090.40 → 2091.40] It's a game.
[2091.40 → 2092.40] It's a game.
[2092.40 → 2093.40] I'm not sure.
[2093.40 → 2094.40] I'm not sure.
[2094.40 → 2097.30] There are a few of their videos that I'm quite into.
[2097.96 → 2099.20] Super cool, guys.
[2099.42 → 2101.82] Got to meet a bunch of the crew down there.
[2101.92 → 2102.62] You worked with them?
[2104.56 → 2106.68] Let me just mute my...
[2106.68 → 2107.94] This has got to be unique.
[2108.12 → 2108.74] I think I muted.
[2110.34 → 2111.18] Hey, that video.
[2111.90 → 2113.38] The title video is fantastic.
[2113.58 → 2114.10] I love that one.
[2115.02 → 2115.56] There we go.
[2116.68 → 2117.64] So I met James.
[2117.80 → 2118.64] Super cool guy.
[2118.98 → 2119.18] Cool.
[2121.76 → 2123.50] There's not going to be any spoilers.
[2123.50 → 2127.92] Anyway, these guys do car videos, and they do them up real well.
[2128.14 → 2129.00] Super professional.
[2129.26 → 2129.72] Great guys.
[2129.96 → 2135.96] I went down there for a collab, and it's like a challenge video of sorts.
[2136.84 → 2146.18] And the punishment is that the losing team had to eat a Carolina Reaper chip.
[2147.12 → 2149.00] So this is like a dried chip.
[2149.10 → 2150.18] It's like this big.
[2150.50 → 2153.00] You share it, but that's like a lot of frigging Carolina Reaper.
[2153.00 → 2153.26] Yeah.
[2153.50 → 2157.14] And you just eat it.
[2160.50 → 2160.94] So...
[2160.94 → 2162.58] I'm very interested in what this...
[2162.58 → 2165.24] This sounds very different.
[2165.50 → 2166.12] I'll say that much.
[2166.76 → 2167.84] It involves me driving.
[2169.04 → 2169.44] Cool.
[2169.52 → 2170.38] It's a driving challenge.
[2170.60 → 2170.92] I just...
[2170.92 → 2171.84] I don't want to say too much.
[2171.84 → 2172.06] No.
[2172.14 → 2172.44] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2172.44 → 2173.16] It's their video.
[2173.24 → 2173.56] We should...
[2173.56 → 2174.06] Yeah, we should probably...
[2174.06 → 2176.10] And I want to make sure that I'm respectful of that.
[2176.30 → 2176.42] Yeah.
[2176.42 → 2177.88] I have no idea when it's coming out.
[2177.88 → 2180.00] I did ask to take a look at it before it comes out.
[2180.00 → 2181.00] But...
[2181.00 → 2188.00] I had a ton of fun down there.
[2188.64 → 2189.64] It was really cool.
[2189.74 → 2190.28] Great guys.
[2190.82 → 2192.98] I think they're growing like really fast right now.
[2193.86 → 2197.40] So they've got 2.5 million subscribers basically.
[2198.14 → 2202.80] But they are doing like half a million views on every single video they upload pretty much.
[2202.88 → 2206.46] And they have some standout ones that are like a lot more than that.
[2206.52 → 2208.32] So people are super into their content.
[2208.54 → 2209.54] And they're just really cool guys.
[2209.54 → 2211.54] I really like that it's just kind of...
[2212.54 → 2213.74] I don't know.
[2213.92 → 2215.04] It just seems positive.
[2215.82 → 2218.14] I don't know how to explain that properly.
[2218.44 → 2220.66] But like you feel pretty good coming out of one of those videos.
[2220.82 → 2221.06] Oh yeah.
[2224.34 → 2226.42] I also want to talk about another big collab.
[2227.24 → 2228.28] So again...
[2228.28 → 2229.08] Woo!
[2230.26 → 2230.96] I'm not...
[2230.96 → 2231.96] I can't share everything.
[2232.34 → 2234.70] Just because NVIDIA is the sponsor for the project.
[2235.38 → 2238.28] And I don't want to like...
[2238.28 → 2239.28] Like technically...
[2240.02 → 2241.18] I mean a lot of people don't know this.
[2241.20 → 2242.28] So technically the way it works...
[2242.80 → 2244.28] I've had people say like...
[2245.56 → 2247.48] Man, I've seen this comment on our own videos.
[2247.70 → 2249.46] I've seen this comment on other people's videos.
[2250.28 → 2250.46] Yeah.
[2250.94 → 2254.38] Who cares if it's a sponsored review as long as they're telling us what they think.
[2254.50 → 2255.34] No, that matters a lot.
[2255.42 → 2256.50] Like no, that matters a lot.
[2256.54 → 2260.60] Because if it's sponsored, it literally has to be cleared by the sponsor.
[2260.92 → 2261.14] Yeah.
[2261.26 → 2261.80] No matter what.
[2262.06 → 2264.34] And a lot of sponsors are pretty chill.
[2265.20 → 2265.36] Yeah.
[2265.36 → 2272.72] In fact, actually, from my experience, NVIDIA, when they'll work with you, which is not very often.
[2272.82 → 2278.60] We've actually done only, I think, three or four deals with them over the entire seven years that Linus Media Group has existed.
[2279.68 → 2280.44] Seven years.
[2281.02 → 2281.52] I know, right?
[2281.80 → 2282.36] They're actually...
[2282.36 → 2283.96] I know, right?
[2283.96 → 2286.30] They're actually pretty chill to work with.
[2286.46 → 2287.86] Perfect people over there.
[2288.00 → 2289.72] A lot of real gamers over there.
[2289.92 → 2295.24] Like they also suffer from a bit of a PR learning disability.
[2295.96 → 2296.96] Because they just like...
[2298.12 → 2301.96] They have all this really, truly amazing, cool tech.
[2302.30 → 2302.96] And then they like...
[2303.52 → 2306.24] They almost put too much glitz and glam on it sometimes.
[2306.48 → 2307.42] And make it seem like too corporate.
[2307.42 → 2310.32] People all the time, they make it feel like it's not for you.
[2311.22 → 2316.74] And I think like one of the issues that I'll bring up with that, if you want to jump to my screen for a second.
[2316.82 → 2317.32] Yeah, for sure.
[2317.32 → 2319.44] Is their own website.
[2319.66 → 2324.92] Because when you go to their website, the driver button just constantly floats to the right.
[2326.92 → 2327.28] Right.
[2327.92 → 2331.70] And I know that seems random and weird and why would I even have noticed that.
[2331.92 → 2332.22] Yep, you're right.
[2332.24 → 2335.96] But now it's platforms and developers and industries and all this other kind of stuff.
[2336.18 → 2337.32] And as like a gamer...
[2338.48 → 2340.32] Drivers and support is what I'm after.
[2341.32 → 2341.58] Yeah.
[2341.82 → 2344.00] And you're kind of shoved way over to the side.
[2344.00 → 2347.34] Everyone knows the primo real estate on a website is top left.
[2347.38 → 2347.78] Top left.
[2348.10 → 2349.88] So they're not looking for you.
[2350.34 → 2351.00] It's...
[2351.76 → 2354.06] And that has always kind of bugged me.
[2354.08 → 2354.86] Even look at the carousel at the top.
[2355.00 → 2356.62] Ride an NVIDIA self-driving car.
[2357.64 → 2357.92] Yep.
[2358.28 → 2361.02] I don't even know what else is here, but that one's definitely there.
[2363.20 → 2364.90] Okay, Mobile World Congress, sure.
[2365.04 → 2367.60] But it doesn't even say like what he's talking about.
[2367.72 → 2368.50] Yep, that's true.
[2368.52 → 2369.00] And it's just MWC.
[2369.80 → 2372.26] So most people outside of industry aren't even going to know what that means.
[2372.40 → 2372.90] That's fair.
[2372.90 → 2374.74] He's not holding a graphics card or something.
[2374.74 → 2376.68] But look how relatable he is in that leather jacket.
[2377.82 → 2378.68] You know what?
[2378.84 → 2379.48] GTC.
[2379.48 → 2383.92] I've been informed that Jensen actually watches our reviews of their products.
[2385.08 → 2391.20] And apparently, if I complain about something, and he feels like I actually have a legitimate point,
[2391.20 → 2398.98] like, not heads will roll, but heads definitely get like informed.
[2399.60 → 2401.16] Like, why did we do it that way?
[2401.92 → 2402.88] I was like, oh, really?
[2402.88 → 2407.36] Because the last time I met him, he like barely knew who I was.
[2407.50 → 2408.84] But that was quite a while ago.
[2409.10 → 2409.22] Yeah.
[2409.22 → 2412.30] So like apparently he legit actually watches our videos.
[2413.00 → 2415.56] Well, like, okay, I complained about this a lot.
[2415.56 → 2415.86] Yeah.
[2415.86 → 2421.98] And then they did change it, but I have been actually fairly recently informed that it was
[2421.98 → 2424.14] not because of community backlash at all.
[2424.14 → 2426.82] But do you know the GeForce Experience driver install thing?
[2426.92 → 2427.06] Yeah.
[2427.20 → 2431.74] Where the only default, if you chose the default buttons, the only option was to have GeForce Experience.
[2431.86 → 2432.04] Yes.
[2432.16 → 2433.88] You had to go into Advance and disable it and take it off.
[2433.92 → 2434.06] Yep.
[2434.06 → 2440.02] So apparently, I have been told I have no idea if this is valid and the source is not from
[2440.02 → 2440.40] NVIDIA.
[2440.90 → 2441.24] Okay.
[2441.32 → 2442.50] I'll be very clear about that.
[2442.58 → 2442.76] Okay.
[2442.92 → 2444.60] So basically, you're just making things up.
[2444.94 → 2445.30] Borderline.
[2445.34 → 2445.66] Proceed.
[2445.78 → 2449.54] But I have been told that the reason why they had to split it out was GDPR.
[2450.46 → 2451.30] Oh, interesting.
[2451.38 → 2451.72] That makes sense.
[2451.72 → 2452.38] Because the telemetry stuff.
[2452.38 → 2452.82] Because, yeah.
[2452.82 → 2455.38] It does make a lot of sense, which is why I'm bringing it up at all.
[2455.74 → 2457.92] But it apparently was not community backlash.
[2458.06 → 2458.68] It was GDPR.
[2459.02 → 2463.96] So there's that, which is like K, because I gave them a lot of credit for doing that.
[2463.96 → 2466.02] Because I thought it was because they were responding to the community.
[2466.02 → 2471.36] So I have some fascinating insight about why they cared so much about collecting
[2471.36 → 2471.82] that data.
[2473.00 → 2475.72] They're actually using it to do some really cool stuff.
[2475.84 → 2476.10] Sure.
[2476.58 → 2482.02] Like, they're using it to change the way they develop future GPUs to make them perform
[2482.02 → 2483.66] better in the ways that people are using them.
[2483.68 → 2484.72] And I was like, oh.
[2484.72 → 2489.68] But you don't walk up to your battery-potted humans and shove a cable in and extract that
[2489.68 → 2490.14] information.
[2490.14 → 2497.32] You, like, talk about how you plan to do really cool things and try to ask for it.
[2497.42 → 2498.04] Yeah, that's fair.
[2498.54 → 2500.26] You can even have it as a default slider.
[2500.36 → 2502.24] But it should be the way that it is now.
[2502.50 → 2502.72] Yeah.
[2502.84 → 2506.30] And it should probably explain why they're pulling that telemetry data and everything
[2506.30 → 2506.54] else.
[2506.62 → 2507.56] How did we get on this topic?
[2508.62 → 2514.40] Talking about how they have PR issues, and they're not in the greatest light right now.
[2514.40 → 2515.42] Before that, though.
[2515.62 → 2516.62] I'm sure there was...
[2516.62 → 2520.42] Because we were talking about another company that was like that.
[2520.46 → 2521.46] We were talking about Intel.
[2521.80 → 2524.18] No, I'm sure I was going somewhere with this.
[2526.14 → 2526.86] Oh, well.
[2528.38 → 2530.38] Nothing I can do about it at this point.
[2531.50 → 2532.94] What topic were we even on?
[2532.96 → 2533.84] I don't even know.
[2534.40 → 2535.72] I was, like, eating jerky.
[2535.92 → 2536.12] Yeah.
[2536.12 → 2536.86] And then...
[2536.86 → 2537.32] Oh, right!
[2537.80 → 2538.62] The, uh...
[2538.62 → 2539.04] The collab!
[2539.72 → 2540.12] Okay.
[2540.20 → 2540.60] Okay.
[2540.96 → 2546.78] So, I actually got to meet, for the first time, Mr. Grimm's Shroud.
[2547.52 → 2548.40] Corey...
[2548.40 → 2550.66] I'm going to call him Corey because that's his Twitter handle.
[2550.74 → 2551.74] I can't just call him Corey.
[2552.10 → 2557.04] Like, he's one of the few pro gamers I'm aware of whose handle is just his first name.
[2557.58 → 2558.72] People are like, where'd you get your handle?
[2558.92 → 2559.96] I was born with it, yo.
[2560.16 → 2560.60] Yeah.
[2560.94 → 2561.28] Yeah.
[2562.34 → 2563.14] You punk.
[2563.14 → 2564.14] Um...
[2564.14 → 2567.18] Anyway, really cool video.
[2567.26 → 2568.18] So, this is a follow-up.
[2568.26 → 2570.70] Did you watch the video that we did with GAV from Slo-Mo Guys?
[2570.72 → 2570.86] Yeah.
[2571.04 → 2571.28] Yeah, yeah.
[2571.34 → 2571.52] Okay.
[2571.90 → 2572.90] So, this time...
[2572.90 → 2573.78] I actually really liked it.
[2573.86 → 2582.66] Instead of talking about 240 hertz versus 60 hertz, we've got 60, 144, and 240.
[2582.90 → 2589.36] Because a lot of people sort of feel like from 60 to 120 or 144 was a big jump.
[2589.68 → 2591.20] And then after that, it's kind of gravy.
[2591.20 → 2595.08] Um, but they haven't quantified it.
[2595.26 → 2596.30] Do you want to know something that I...
[2596.30 → 2596.42] Yeah.
[2596.98 → 2598.58] ...have never publicly admitted?
[2598.84 → 2599.02] Mm.
[2599.46 → 2602.78] Um, and I hate to admit, but I'm just going to be honest with myself and everyone here.
[2603.56 → 2605.60] I have a really high fresh rate monitor now.
[2605.96 → 2607.20] You're running it at 60, aren't you?
[2607.20 → 2608.10] No, no, no, no, no, no.
[2609.02 → 2609.70] For sure, no.
[2610.70 → 2611.22] Um...
[2611.22 → 2613.10] And I feel like I'm...
[2613.10 → 2617.18] I'm not great, but I feel like I'm pretty solid at shooter games in general.
[2618.22 → 2620.26] I don't notice that big of a difference.
[2620.76 → 2621.02] Okay.
[2621.18 → 2621.96] So, I'm really...
[2621.96 → 2623.12] I'm so glad you brought that up.
[2623.24 → 2625.10] So, whether you...
[2625.78 → 2628.88] Which makes me so sad inside, but, like, I don't think I do.
[2628.88 → 2636.14] Whether you feel like it or whether you notice it, have you sought to quantify the difference?
[2636.60 → 2638.26] A little bit, but not...
[2638.26 → 2640.52] You can't quantify a little bit.
[2640.92 → 2641.38] But, like...
[2641.38 → 2642.24] You have to quantify it.
[2642.24 → 2645.78] I've switched back and forth between the two and tried to measure how well I'm doing,
[2645.94 → 2648.24] but I don't have, like, the high-speed cameras and...
[2648.24 → 2648.32] Yeah.
[2648.32 → 2649.68] Like, I haven't gone that far.
[2649.76 → 2651.04] So, we went that far.
[2651.04 → 2651.18] Yeah.
[2651.46 → 2654.46] High-speed cameras, five different test scenarios.
[2655.04 → 2656.36] So, we started...
[2656.36 → 2660.50] Oh, and also, instead of just looking at monitor refresh rate this time,
[2660.54 → 2662.76] because that doesn't really tell the whole story,
[2663.16 → 2668.40] because you can have the game running at very high FPS on a lower refresh rate monitor,
[2668.60 → 2672.48] and you're actually getting a more up-to-date frame when it does refresh.
[2673.02 → 2673.14] Right?
[2673.46 → 2675.94] So, what we did instead was we actually...
[2675.94 → 2676.62] This is hilarious.
[2676.62 → 2682.06] We had an NVIDIA-sponsored video where the only handicap to the systems
[2682.06 → 2685.92] was, like, crap-tier GPUs on the lower-end ones.
[2686.18 → 2686.68] Okay.
[2686.76 → 2691.24] So, we run at 60 Hz, 60 FPS by running a very old graphics card.
[2691.38 → 2691.54] Yeah.
[2692.30 → 2696.44] 144 Hz, 150, 180 FPS.
[2696.78 → 2698.26] And, actually, it wasn't quite 60 FPS.
[2698.34 → 2699.42] It was, like, 70, 75.
[2700.08 → 2704.06] And then we've got our 240 Hz, like, 250 to 300 FPS.
[2704.34 → 2704.54] Okay.
[2704.54 → 2705.48] We've got three different machines.
[2705.48 → 2710.40] So, we're really looking at the gaming experience at different frame rates.
[2710.92 → 2714.24] So, we have, like, well-rounded systems.
[2714.32 → 2717.90] And I insisted that all the systems had 9,900 KS.
[2718.32 → 2719.58] Right, because you're trying to...
[2719.58 → 2719.84] Yeah.
[2719.84 → 2729.40] Because I didn't want people to watch the video and think, oh, well, you know, of course NVIDIA
[2729.40 → 2734.32] would, you know, bottleneck the systems with Intel CPUs instead of their own GPUs.
[2734.32 → 2734.76] I was like, no.
[2735.50 → 2736.28] You need to just put...
[2736.84 → 2739.14] Find the oldest graphics card you can in your office.
[2739.32 → 2743.72] Let's find one that will run these games at only, like, 60, 75 FPS.
[2743.72 → 2748.98] So, you're getting this, like, really different experience if you were to build, like, a more
[2748.98 → 2754.08] balanced rig around 60, 144, or 244 Hz or 244 FPS targets.
[2754.22 → 2754.40] Okay.
[2754.56 → 2756.84] Or 244, excuse me, 240 FPS targets.
[2757.90 → 2760.10] Then we did five different tests.
[2760.28 → 2762.72] So, first was pure reaction time.
[2763.00 → 2763.28] Okay.
[2763.28 → 2765.08] So, it's like a synthetic test.
[2765.18 → 2767.60] The light turns green, you click as fast as you can.
[2768.66 → 2769.14] And...
[2769.14 → 2770.94] My brain's telling me Shroud was insane at that.
[2771.82 → 2772.20] Really?
[2773.74 → 2777.00] Because what I've seen of him is ridiculous.
[2777.00 → 2778.34] How many spoilers do you guys want?
[2778.76 → 2779.86] You guys want some spoilers?
[2781.24 → 2783.64] There is so much information in this video.
[2783.70 → 2784.62] I'm really excited for it.
[2784.76 → 2786.10] I was talking to David.
[2786.38 → 2787.74] You know David's an avid gamer, right?
[2787.84 → 2787.98] Yeah.
[2788.04 → 2788.22] Yeah.
[2788.30 → 2789.22] So, I was talking to David about it.
[2789.22 → 2792.00] He's like, I'm going to watch this video multiple times.
[2792.00 → 2792.90] I already know.
[2793.22 → 2793.36] Yeah, I probably will too.
[2793.36 → 2797.86] Because even though I was here, there's going to be so much information, you're going to
[2797.86 → 2799.24] have to watch it multiple times.
[2799.34 → 2803.18] And every time, you're going to pick up something that you missed last time.
[2803.70 → 2807.30] So, no matter what I spoil, there's going to be...
[2807.30 → 2809.64] Oh, I've got people saying no spoilers in the chat.
[2810.04 → 2811.84] I bet that's a pretty unpopular...
[2811.84 → 2815.10] I'm super interested.
[2815.26 → 2815.98] I want to know whatever.
[2816.16 → 2817.08] Because, like, I...
[2817.08 → 2817.80] Yeah, people want it.
[2817.86 → 2818.06] Okay.
[2818.16 → 2818.58] Here we go.
[2820.08 → 2821.80] Shroud's reaction times, on average,
[2821.80 → 2822.80] no faster than mine.
[2823.42 → 2823.68] Really?
[2823.94 → 2824.20] Really.
[2826.20 → 2826.60] Wow.
[2827.18 → 2827.40] Yep.
[2827.76 → 2828.86] Raw reaction times.
[2829.62 → 2830.64] Okay, we're...
[2830.64 → 2830.98] Hmm.
[2830.98 → 2832.52] I don't know how much I want to ask.
[2833.44 → 2835.58] Were you guys at, like, the top?
[2836.00 → 2836.32] No.
[2838.90 → 2840.18] I don't know anything anymore.
[2840.44 → 2842.20] I just have to say everything's over.
[2842.42 → 2844.04] Because you've got to remember, I'm over the hill.
[2844.58 → 2845.84] I'm 33, yo.
[2846.20 → 2846.46] Yeah.
[2846.46 → 2851.20] I don't have young guy synapse firing anymore.
[2851.34 → 2852.86] But you've always been pretty quick.
[2853.52 → 2854.72] Yeah, but...
[2854.72 → 2857.46] He's only, like, 25.
[2858.92 → 2860.60] Like, theoretically...
[2860.60 → 2860.88] Yeah.
[2861.62 → 2862.70] So, okay.
[2862.84 → 2863.70] Test number two.
[2863.92 → 2864.18] Okay.
[2864.88 → 2868.54] This is a reaction time test, but real world.
[2868.96 → 2872.76] So, you know the classic Dust 2 double doors' sniper shot?
[2872.86 → 2873.30] Yes, yep.
[2873.54 → 2873.72] Okay.
[2873.80 → 2874.40] So, you're a terrorist.
[2874.64 → 2876.86] You get the op down the double doors,
[2877.00 → 2879.38] and the CTs try to get over to bomb site B,
[2879.48 → 2880.70] and you take one out.
[2880.88 → 2882.26] All of a sudden, 5v4.
[2882.70 → 2883.28] Great start.
[2884.22 → 2884.58] All right.
[2884.58 → 2891.32] So, the test is, at 60fps, 144fps, and 240fps,
[2892.16 → 2893.86] what percentage of those shots can you hit?
[2894.18 → 2894.52] Okay.
[2894.80 → 2898.14] So, you might think that's the same test.
[2898.62 → 2900.56] As soon as you see a guy, you hit him.
[2901.72 → 2904.12] But, we got dramatically different results
[2904.12 → 2906.54] in terms of people's reaction times.
[2907.36 → 2907.76] Interesting.
[2908.14 → 2908.98] Interesting, indeed.
[2909.44 → 2910.84] Yeah, because, like, I think...
[2910.84 → 2913.40] So, when I hook up a higher refresh rate monitor,
[2913.40 → 2915.36] I can even tell on, like, the desktop
[2915.36 → 2917.72] that things feel a little better.
[2918.18 → 2918.74] Hold on.
[2919.00 → 2919.52] This is great.
[2919.62 → 2920.06] People are like,
[2920.28 → 2921.22] I'm 33 too.
[2921.44 → 2922.26] 33 is young.
[2922.88 → 2924.24] People get so...
[2924.24 → 2926.40] I had a conversation with someone about this the other day.
[2926.58 → 2930.12] People get so offended when you use old too early.
[2930.82 → 2931.84] So, let me...
[2931.84 → 2933.06] I just don't get it.
[2933.06 → 2935.24] Let me drop a little knowledge bomb on you guys.
[2935.56 → 2937.56] By the time you're over 30,
[2938.12 → 2940.40] you are already slow...
[2940.40 → 2942.92] enough slower than young guys
[2942.92 → 2945.94] that it is very difficult to be competitive as a pro gamer.
[2946.74 → 2948.34] Like, I'm sorry.
[2948.48 → 2949.56] Aging is a thing.
[2950.28 → 2952.12] And I am...
[2952.12 → 2954.44] I would be old for a pro gamer.
[2954.58 → 2955.04] There's a reason why...
[2955.04 → 2956.80] I'm, like, in the twilight years of my career.
[2957.00 → 2958.42] And I better be making up for it
[2958.42 → 2961.86] by giving great calls to my teammates
[2961.86 → 2962.92] and being more like a team coordinator.
[2962.92 → 2963.82] I was just going to say,
[2963.94 → 2964.92] there's a reason why...
[2966.28 → 2967.06] And not everyone...
[2967.06 → 2968.40] And there's going to be exceptions to this, whatever.
[2968.40 → 2970.94] But there's a reason why a significant amount of, like,
[2971.08 → 2972.98] older FPS players get more tactical.
[2973.66 → 2974.06] Absolutely.
[2974.38 → 2975.12] And less twitchy.
[2975.50 → 2975.86] Absolutely.
[2975.86 → 2977.14] There's an absolute reason why.
[2977.18 → 2978.74] And you can still be super effective.
[2979.18 → 2980.20] I'm sure you can play...
[2980.20 → 2980.58] I know...
[2980.58 → 2983.02] There are old videos of a like,
[2983.46 → 2984.66] definite grandfather
[2984.66 → 2986.60] playing a Battlefield game
[2986.60 → 2987.78] and just wrecking people.
[2988.04 → 2989.76] But it's because, if you watch,
[2989.82 → 2990.42] he wasn't, like,
[2991.30 → 2992.80] in close quarters combat,
[2993.44 → 2994.76] like, ninja jumping people.
[2995.00 → 2995.24] Yeah.
[2995.36 → 2996.36] He was just...
[2996.36 → 2997.98] He had extreme knowledge of the game,
[2998.34 → 2999.26] played all day,
[2999.74 → 3000.80] had perfect tactics,
[3001.68 → 3002.40] used, like,
[3002.68 → 3004.50] different troops to make sure...
[3004.50 → 3004.84] I don't know.
[3004.92 → 3006.20] It was really cool to watch,
[3006.22 → 3007.00] and he did really well.
[3008.56 → 3009.96] But it's just a different type of gameplay.
[3010.98 → 3011.08] I don't know.
[3011.08 → 3011.22] Yeah.
[3011.64 → 3013.54] 25 to 28 peak of the...
[3013.54 → 3014.50] Biological peak of the...
[3014.50 → 3015.18] So it depends.
[3015.30 → 3016.18] There's cognitive peak,
[3016.18 → 3017.08] there's physical peak,
[3017.18 → 3018.42] they're not all in the same spot.
[3018.54 → 3019.00] But anyway,
[3019.64 → 3020.58] test number three.
[3020.94 → 3021.26] Okay.
[3022.30 → 3023.42] Flick aiming test.
[3023.88 → 3024.14] Yeah.
[3024.60 → 3025.16] So...
[3025.16 → 3026.52] Oh, man.
[3026.60 → 3027.42] This one's really hard.
[3027.84 → 3029.26] So basically, you've got...
[3029.26 → 3030.04] We're using McCrae
[3030.04 → 3031.58] because we had decided
[3031.58 → 3032.36] on all of our tests
[3032.36 → 3034.22] before some recent events went down.
[3034.44 → 3034.72] Okay.
[3034.78 → 3035.90] So we're using McCrae.
[3036.08 → 3036.38] Okay.
[3037.66 → 3040.64] You've got 0.45 of a second
[3040.64 → 3043.10] to flick over and hit a target.
[3044.04 → 3045.66] You get 60 seconds
[3045.66 → 3046.78] and 30 targets.
[3052.82 → 3053.58] How many of those
[3053.58 → 3054.30] do you think you could hit
[3054.30 → 3056.10] in a box about this big?
[3056.84 → 3059.30] You have 0.45 of a second
[3059.30 → 3062.14] to move and accurately hit it.
[3062.34 → 3063.12] I don't like...
[3063.12 → 3064.46] I don't feel like
[3064.46 → 3065.56] I would be that great
[3065.56 → 3066.70] because I feel like...
[3066.70 → 3067.72] I think one of the reasons
[3067.72 → 3068.58] why I'm...
[3068.58 → 3069.46] I think I'm definitely
[3069.46 → 3070.82] above average in shooter games
[3070.82 → 3071.66] but not great.
[3072.06 → 3072.94] And I think the reason
[3072.94 → 3073.84] why I've been able to hold that
[3073.84 → 3074.50] for a long time
[3074.50 → 3076.10] is because I accepted
[3076.10 → 3077.44] a long time ago
[3077.44 → 3078.44] that I'm already
[3078.44 → 3079.48] in the old guy category
[3079.48 → 3081.08] and I need to be more tactical.
[3081.86 → 3082.38] Got it.
[3082.46 → 3083.26] I play shooter games
[3083.26 → 3084.86] with Joe
[3084.86 → 3087.30] and he is not
[3087.30 → 3088.52] in the old guy category
[3088.52 → 3090.52] and is super flick
[3090.52 → 3091.28] and twitchy
[3091.28 → 3092.34] and wrecks people
[3092.34 → 3093.30] and I just sit back
[3093.30 → 3093.64] and make sure
[3093.64 → 3094.90] he knows where they all are.
[3094.90 → 3096.84] and I do a little bit
[3096.84 → 3097.46] of damage to them
[3097.46 → 3098.34] before they show up
[3098.34 → 3099.42] so it's even easier
[3099.42 → 3100.36] and I just like...
[3100.36 → 3101.08] I know my role.
[3101.28 → 3101.80] I support.
[3102.16 → 3102.62] And I make sure
[3102.62 → 3103.34] everything's going to be okay.
[3103.88 → 3104.62] Know your role
[3104.62 → 3105.26] and shut your mouth.
[3105.34 → 3106.22] Yeah, I don't know.
[3106.34 → 3106.46] Whatever.
[3106.50 → 3107.36] Except unless your role
[3107.36 → 3108.16] is to open your mouth
[3108.16 → 3108.90] and make calls.
[3109.22 → 3109.82] Then, yeah.
[3110.06 → 3110.86] Well, you know.
[3110.98 → 3111.08] Yeah.
[3111.58 → 3112.60] But like...
[3112.60 → 3113.56] So I don't think
[3113.56 → 3114.36] I would do that great.
[3114.50 → 3115.38] I think I would do okay
[3115.38 → 3116.44] but not that great.
[3116.56 → 3117.52] So that test
[3117.52 → 3119.02] was where people's
[3119.02 → 3120.54] skill in gaming
[3120.54 → 3121.70] really started to come in
[3121.70 → 3122.44] because the other ones
[3122.44 → 3123.38] were more reaction time.
[3123.56 → 3123.66] Yeah.
[3123.66 → 3124.94] So test number four
[3124.94 → 3127.28] is where you've got
[3127.28 → 3127.90] to kind of bring it
[3127.90 → 3128.58] all together.
[3129.40 → 3131.18] So it's a custom map
[3131.18 → 3132.70] that was actually tuned...
[3132.70 → 3133.50] Not created for
[3133.50 → 3135.92] but tuned for this event.
[3136.42 → 3136.84] Really cool.
[3136.90 → 3137.44] We got a lot
[3137.44 → 3138.32] of really great support.
[3138.64 → 3139.14] There's going to be
[3139.14 → 3139.94] shoutouts in the video.
[3140.84 → 3143.02] But it's bomb site B defence
[3143.02 → 3144.10] in Counter-Strike Go
[3144.10 → 3144.76] and it's kind of a...
[3144.76 → 3145.96] It's a pop-up shooting gallery.
[3146.72 → 3148.50] So terrorists...
[3148.50 → 3148.62] Dust2?
[3148.88 → 3149.50] Yeah, Dust2.
[3149.68 → 3151.20] So terrorists just start
[3151.20 → 3151.76] popping in
[3151.76 → 3152.96] and strafing around
[3152.96 → 3154.24] and moving around
[3154.24 → 3155.22] and you've got to kill
[3155.22 → 3156.74] 15 of them
[3156.74 → 3157.92] as fast as you can.
[3158.88 → 3160.38] So I will say
[3160.38 → 3163.12] that our Overwatch Pro...
[3163.12 → 3164.28] So we had a pro gamer there
[3164.28 → 3165.56] 20 years old.
[3165.96 → 3167.06] Our Overwatch Pro
[3167.06 → 3169.92] absolutely destroyed
[3169.92 → 3172.20] the flick aiming test.
[3172.96 → 3173.48] Unbelievable.
[3174.32 → 3175.22] Hopefully this isn't
[3175.22 → 3175.94] too much of a spoiler
[3175.94 → 3176.88] but on one run
[3176.88 → 3179.06] he hit 28 out of 30 targets.
[3179.60 → 3182.22] 0.45 seconds.
[3182.46 → 3183.22] Oh man.
[3183.50 → 3185.10] And his reaction time...
[3185.90 → 3187.08] Even when he hit
[3187.08 → 3188.26] a similar number of targets
[3188.26 → 3189.28] to someone else on a run
[3189.28 → 3190.70] his reaction time
[3190.70 → 3191.82] was so much faster.
[3192.96 → 3193.50] Just...
[3193.50 → 3194.22] Unbelievable.
[3194.68 → 3194.90] Anyway.
[3195.64 → 3196.48] I hate him.
[3199.28 → 3199.88] But...
[3199.88 → 3201.02] when it came to
[3201.02 → 3202.18] bomb site B defence
[3202.18 → 3204.80] Shroud was untouchable.
[3206.24 → 3206.88] Because
[3206.88 → 3209.26] even though his reactions
[3209.26 → 3210.94] were old man Linus
[3210.94 → 3211.80] slow
[3211.80 → 3215.04] he just had
[3215.04 → 3217.00] that game sense
[3217.00 → 3218.08] and that flow.
[3218.60 → 3219.38] And his aim
[3219.38 → 3220.00] and his ability
[3220.00 → 3220.78] to track
[3220.78 → 3221.60] is insane.
[3222.56 → 3223.46] Like just...
[3223.46 → 3225.26] You watch him in...
[3225.26 → 3225.76] People call him
[3225.76 → 3226.38] the human aim bot
[3226.38 → 3226.74] all the time
[3226.74 → 3227.38] because you watch him
[3227.38 → 3228.02] in different scenarios
[3228.02 → 3228.82] and someone will be
[3228.82 → 3229.42] jumping around
[3229.42 → 3229.78] and moving
[3229.78 → 3230.38] and all this kind of stuff
[3230.38 → 3231.30] and it's always
[3231.30 → 3233.00] exactly flowing with them.
[3233.12 → 3233.96] I've seen people
[3233.96 → 3235.10] accuse him of cheating
[3235.10 → 3235.90] and I think there's
[3235.90 → 3236.64] going to be a lot less
[3236.64 → 3236.96] of that
[3236.96 → 3237.80] after people watch
[3237.80 → 3238.30] this video.
[3238.54 → 3238.60] Yeah.
[3239.04 → 3239.28] Yeah.
[3239.58 → 3240.72] I watched a video
[3240.72 → 3241.78] a whole like
[3241.78 → 3243.00] produced relatively
[3243.00 → 3243.82] good video
[3243.82 → 3244.70] of some guy
[3244.70 → 3245.62] accusing him of cheating
[3245.62 → 3246.54] just because like
[3246.54 → 3247.46] he plays so many
[3247.46 → 3247.88] different games
[3247.88 → 3248.62] he plays them so early
[3248.62 → 3249.30] you know he's not.
[3249.76 → 3250.16] But
[3250.16 → 3251.16] I wanted to see like
[3251.16 → 3251.66] where is this
[3251.66 → 3253.72] mindset coming from
[3253.72 → 3254.78] and it's pretty insane.
[3255.10 → 3256.38] There are many clips of him
[3256.38 → 3257.16] that are like
[3257.16 → 3258.82] What?
[3258.94 → 3259.66] It shouldn't be possible.
[3259.74 → 3259.96] Yeah.
[3260.34 → 3260.96] So I'm like
[3260.96 → 3261.38] okay
[3261.38 → 3262.94] but yeah
[3262.94 → 3263.38] he's just
[3263.38 → 3264.02] he's insane
[3264.02 → 3265.12] so I thought
[3265.12 → 3265.50] he'd do good
[3265.50 → 3265.96] at some point.
[3266.16 → 3266.58] It's good to hear.
[3266.66 → 3267.06] And then there was
[3267.06 → 3267.98] a fifth bonus test
[3267.98 → 3269.10] that only some people did
[3269.10 → 3269.98] that was a
[3269.98 → 3270.82] head-to-head
[3270.82 → 3272.00] opting each other
[3272.00 → 3272.60] down a hallway
[3272.60 → 3273.16] test.
[3274.02 → 3274.96] I tried.
[3278.44 → 3279.48] Did you get one?
[3280.04 → 3281.30] I don't remember
[3281.30 → 3282.32] if I got any kills.
[3283.02 → 3283.46] Okay.
[3284.16 → 3285.52] I might have gotten
[3285.52 → 3286.88] one on Mike.
[3287.16 → 3287.96] Okay.
[3288.34 → 3289.16] One or two, maybe.
[3289.40 → 3289.68] Okay.
[3289.86 → 3291.02] But I might have had
[3291.02 → 3291.86] a hardware advantage
[3291.86 → 3292.86] when I got him.
[3293.02 → 3293.42] Okay.
[3293.84 → 3295.12] That's interesting too though.
[3295.24 → 3295.48] Yeah.
[3295.58 → 3296.40] That's actually very interesting.
[3296.40 → 3297.30] Well that's part of the test
[3297.30 → 3297.44] isn't it?
[3297.44 → 3297.66] Yeah.
[3297.86 → 3298.00] Yeah.
[3298.44 → 3300.88] So great collab.
[3301.12 → 3301.92] I'm really looking forward
[3301.92 → 3302.78] to releasing that video
[3302.78 → 3303.34] for you guys.
[3303.44 → 3304.38] It will take some time.
[3304.38 → 3304.50] I really think
[3304.50 → 3305.32] if you guys can
[3305.32 → 3306.44] setting that up at LTX
[3306.44 → 3307.26] would be super cool.
[3307.38 → 3308.20] That one legitimately.
[3308.38 → 3309.10] Not the server one.
[3309.16 → 3310.08] You know what's really cool
[3310.08 → 3311.36] is that all the tests
[3311.36 → 3312.60] are going to be publicly available
[3312.60 → 3314.06] by the time the video goes up.
[3314.06 → 3315.14] And we're going to have them
[3315.14 → 3315.94] linked under the video
[3315.94 → 3316.90] so you can go
[3316.90 → 3317.72] on your own rig.
[3317.98 → 3318.90] You can do all the tests
[3318.90 → 3319.64] and you can compare
[3319.64 → 3320.30] to our results.
[3321.12 → 3321.26] Neat.
[3321.26 → 3322.08] That's very cool.
[3322.22 → 3322.38] Yeah.
[3322.42 → 3323.16] Now I can see
[3323.16 → 3324.14] if it actually matters
[3324.14 → 3325.28] that I bought a nice monitor.
[3325.52 → 3325.70] Yeah.
[3327.86 → 3329.02] I don't know
[3329.02 → 3329.32] because yeah
[3329.32 → 3330.30] I can tell
[3330.30 → 3331.24] I can feel
[3331.24 → 3332.36] that it's higher frustrate
[3332.36 → 3333.80] but I don't necessarily know
[3333.80 → 3334.46] if it's actually
[3334.46 → 3336.52] impacting my kills.
[3336.68 → 3336.92] Right.
[3337.02 → 3337.62] Especially because
[3337.62 → 3338.48] of how I play.
[3338.64 → 3338.96] Exactly.
[3338.98 → 3339.60] When I'm sitting back
[3339.60 → 3340.34] and making more calls
[3340.34 → 3341.24] and doing all that kind of stuff.
[3341.80 → 3342.26] All right.
[3342.74 → 3343.54] Last topic.
[3343.84 → 3344.54] Google unveils
[3344.54 → 3345.32] the Pixel 4.
[3345.54 → 3346.30] Pixelbook Go.
[3346.50 → 3347.52] New Pixel Buds.
[3347.60 → 3348.10] Nest Mini.
[3348.54 → 3349.56] Read Home Mini 2.
[3349.92 → 3351.62] And Nest Wi-Fi routers
[3351.62 → 3352.40] and points.
[3353.08 → 3354.84] Pixel 4's big feature
[3354.84 → 3356.42] is the project solely
[3356.42 → 3357.64] based motion sense
[3357.64 → 3358.38] so the radar
[3358.38 → 3359.14] that's built into
[3359.14 → 3359.88] the front of the phone.
[3360.28 → 3361.02] 90 hertz display.
[3361.14 → 3362.00] Snapdragon 855.
[3362.00 → 3362.88] 6 gigs of RAM.
[3363.00 → 3364.12] Extra zoom lens on the back.
[3364.56 → 3366.04] 799 and 899
[3366.04 → 3367.44] for the 4XL.
[3369.78 → 3370.88] Riley was hoping
[3370.88 → 3372.18] they had finger twiddling gestures
[3372.18 → 3372.78] for solely
[3372.78 → 3373.52] but they probably won't
[3373.52 → 3374.46] because life is pain.
[3375.76 → 3376.96] Thank you for that note.
[3377.20 → 3377.98] Presumably James.
[3378.52 → 3379.26] Pixelbook Go.
[3379.42 → 3380.84] 13 inch 1080p display.
[3381.00 → 3381.78] Magnesium shell.
[3381.92 → 3382.94] 13 millimetres thick.
[3383.04 → 3383.74] Under 2 pounds.
[3383.88 → 3384.72] Starts at 649
[3384.72 → 3385.36] with a Core M3.
[3385.44 → 3385.96] 8 gigs of RAM
[3385.96 → 3387.38] and 64 gigs of storage.
[3387.78 → 3388.56] The only question is
[3388.56 → 3389.18] why does Google
[3389.18 → 3390.04] keep making these?
[3391.00 → 3391.64] Pixel Buds.
[3391.64 → 3392.70] They use beam forming mics
[3392.70 → 3393.46] and accelerometers
[3393.46 → 3394.32] to detect audio
[3394.32 → 3395.14] through the jawbone.
[3395.26 → 3396.46] Calls should be super clear.
[3396.94 → 3397.78] On-device touch controls
[3397.78 → 3398.42] and voice input
[3398.42 → 3399.32] will be 179
[3399.32 → 3400.48] when they launch in 2020.
[3401.38 → 3402.12] Why is Google
[3402.12 → 3402.94] announcing this now?
[3403.38 → 3403.82] The Nest Mini
[3403.82 → 3405.60] is a home mini too.
[3406.02 → 3406.82] It's got a wall mount,
[3406.94 → 3407.60] a third microphone,
[3407.74 → 3408.58] and deeper bass
[3408.58 → 3409.22] but is otherwise
[3409.22 → 3410.58] basically the same thing.
[3411.12 → 3411.68] And finally,
[3411.76 → 3412.36] Nest Wi-Fi
[3412.36 → 3413.24] is made up of a router,
[3413.58 → 3415.68] no real interesting features,
[3415.82 → 3416.38] and a point
[3416.38 → 3417.50] which serves as a mesh unit
[3417.50 → 3418.38] but also is essentially
[3418.38 → 3418.88] a Nest Mini
[3418.88 → 3420.16] with Hey Google support
[3420.16 → 3421.16] and a speaker built in.
[3421.48 → 3422.54] 269 for a
[3422.54 → 3423.18] shut up Google,
[3423.80 → 3424.18] a router
[3424.18 → 3425.14] and a point together.
[3426.20 → 3426.88] So there you go.
[3427.02 → 3429.20] Stay tuned for my Pixel 4.
[3429.64 → 3429.96] No, no,
[3430.00 → 3430.76] I'm not talking to you right now.
[3430.76 → 3431.70] So I've been on a kick
[3431.70 → 3432.54] for a while
[3432.54 → 3434.06] of having the last generation
[3434.06 → 3434.74] of Pixel phones.
[3434.88 → 3435.06] Yeah.
[3435.06 → 3437.44] And honestly,
[3437.84 → 3439.14] with how they've launched
[3439.14 → 3440.30] every Pixel phone,
[3440.50 → 3441.24] I think it's probably
[3441.24 → 3442.04] not a bad idea
[3442.04 → 3443.16] because you'll probably
[3443.16 → 3444.40] have a way better experience
[3444.40 → 3445.66] if you just buy the older one.
[3446.84 → 3447.18] But,
[3448.46 → 3451.18] I might just hold out
[3451.18 → 3451.90] on this one
[3451.90 → 3453.62] until the 4 is like
[3453.62 → 3455.50] mature.
[3455.64 → 3456.08] And then you just
[3456.08 → 3457.28] never have to experience
[3457.28 → 3459.52] that weird notch of history.
[3459.64 → 3459.82] Yep.
[3460.78 → 3461.14] Oh,
[3461.40 → 3462.24] that's pretty good.
[3462.44 → 3463.20] That's pretty good.
[3463.32 → 3463.62] But yeah,
[3463.70 → 3464.80] I feel like I would just hold it.
[3464.80 → 3466.00] It's also still fine.
[3466.64 → 3467.78] Battery life is still okay.
[3467.92 → 3468.64] And I could always just
[3468.64 → 3469.60] get it popped open
[3469.60 → 3470.54] and get a new battery in it,
[3470.64 → 3470.84] really.
[3471.32 → 3471.94] Performance wise,
[3472.28 → 3472.54] I mean,
[3472.78 → 3473.70] it does email great.
[3474.02 → 3474.28] So,
[3474.50 → 3475.18] I think I'm okay.
[3475.80 → 3476.76] I don't do...
[3476.76 → 3477.72] The only real upgrade
[3477.72 → 3478.30] right now,
[3478.36 → 3478.76] in my opinion,
[3478.84 → 3480.44] is a full...
[3480.44 → 3480.74] Yeah.
[3480.94 → 3481.14] Yeah.
[3481.30 → 3482.08] That would be...
[3482.08 → 3482.20] Yeah,
[3482.24 → 3483.22] but then that's too expensive.
[3483.50 → 3483.82] So like,
[3483.86 → 3484.78] I'm not going to do that either.
[3485.30 → 3485.56] So,
[3485.80 → 3486.42] but I agree.
[3486.72 → 3487.86] I think that would be...
[3487.86 → 3489.28] The second you open an email
[3489.28 → 3490.86] was mind-blowing.
[3491.08 → 3491.30] Yeah.
[3491.54 → 3492.28] That would be fantastic.
[3492.28 → 3492.90] And I got the tablet view
[3492.90 → 3493.34] in Gmail.
[3493.64 → 3493.82] Yeah.
[3493.82 → 3494.34] So you can like,
[3494.42 → 3494.90] see your emails
[3494.90 → 3496.04] and also preview them.
[3496.04 → 3497.36] That's super cool.
[3497.68 → 3498.48] But I'm not going to spend
[3498.48 → 3499.14] that much on a phone.
[3499.28 → 3499.46] So,
[3499.60 → 3500.30] I don't know.
[3500.84 → 3501.24] All right.
[3501.34 → 3501.92] One more thing.
[3502.12 → 3502.36] Yes.
[3502.74 → 3503.86] I think we should go over this.
[3504.22 → 3505.42] Riot Games...
[3505.42 → 3505.76] Yes.
[3505.76 → 3506.70] ...for Blizzard's Crown.
[3506.86 → 3508.38] This is actually nuts.
[3508.38 → 3510.68] They announced so many things.
[3510.84 → 3512.72] People have been talking for years
[3512.72 → 3514.62] about why are they even called Riot Games
[3514.62 → 3515.76] because they only have one game.
[3516.06 → 3516.28] Yeah.
[3516.44 → 3518.08] It would just be called League of Legends Games.
[3518.26 → 3519.70] That looks like that's going to change
[3519.70 → 3521.56] because there are tons of stuff now.
[3521.72 → 3524.14] So this is like Overwatch meets Rainbow Six Siege,
[3524.20 → 3524.50] apparently?
[3524.96 → 3526.90] A lot of people have been making those comparisons.
[3527.34 → 3530.06] They are apparently trying to have it more compared
[3530.06 → 3532.20] against Counter-Strike Go.
[3533.50 → 3533.94] Interesting.
[3533.94 → 3535.44] So I have a feeling it's going to be
[3535.44 → 3537.86] a little bit more decisive type of kills.
[3540.82 → 3542.94] That looks a lot like Overwatch,
[3543.12 → 3544.02] not Counter-Strike Go.
[3544.14 → 3545.28] That guy just got resurrected.
[3545.60 → 3547.08] That doesn't work in Counter-Strike.
[3547.30 → 3549.42] I don't necessarily know why they want that comparison.
[3549.82 → 3550.04] Yeah.
[3550.42 → 3551.28] But they...
[3551.28 → 3551.54] Wow.
[3551.74 → 3551.94] Yeah.
[3552.16 → 3552.46] Okay.
[3552.62 → 3553.44] That doesn't...
[3553.44 → 3554.30] That looks pretty Overwatch-y.
[3554.30 → 3556.14] That looks extremely Overwatch-y, Riot.
[3556.56 → 3558.08] I hadn't even seen that yet.
[3558.14 → 3559.08] I was trying to defend you.
[3559.18 → 3560.38] Where is that even coming from?
[3560.84 → 3561.20] Okay.
[3561.66 → 3563.38] They're also announcing a mobile game.
[3563.38 → 3565.20] called Wild Rift.
[3565.80 → 3566.72] One moment, please.
[3567.56 → 3568.28] Working on it.
[3568.70 → 3568.94] Yep.
[3569.30 → 3569.90] Blah, blah, blah.
[3570.02 → 3570.52] Yes, yes, yes.
[3570.52 → 3571.36] 41 seconds.
[3571.82 → 3572.44] Wild Rift.
[3572.50 → 3572.80] 41?
[3573.10 → 3573.52] There we go.
[3573.68 → 3574.06] Oh, wow.
[3574.10 → 3574.52] I nailed it.
[3576.10 → 3576.76] Wait, really?
[3576.92 → 3578.20] I love how all mobile games,
[3578.42 → 3579.56] they show real life.
[3579.62 → 3580.44] They don't show the mobile game
[3580.44 → 3581.30] because mobile games suck.
[3582.90 → 3583.72] You kidding me?
[3585.12 → 3586.74] So is it just League of Legends mobile?
[3588.64 → 3589.42] It looks...
[3589.42 → 3591.36] It really looks like it's League of Legends mobile.
[3592.22 → 3592.58] Okay.
[3593.38 → 3593.98] Okay.
[3594.10 → 3594.64] Sounds good.
[3595.64 → 3597.58] Fighting game, Project L.
[3598.28 → 3601.22] This is just like a polygon link,
[3601.36 → 3602.44] so I don't think we have a video
[3602.44 → 3603.82] like we did for the last two.
[3607.32 → 3608.80] But it looks like it's using...
[3608.80 → 3609.90] Looks like a fighting game.
[3609.90 → 3611.04] ... Legal Legends characters
[3611.04 → 3612.38] in a fighting game.
[3613.38 → 3613.64] Neat.
[3613.64 → 3615.46] That's super hard to do in 2019.
[3615.72 → 3616.18] Thanks, guys.
[3616.60 → 3619.74] A top-down MMO called Project F.
[3620.22 → 3621.40] You might be noticing a theme
[3621.40 → 3622.28] to the names for these.
[3623.48 → 3624.88] Is this the one that'll never make it?
[3625.36 → 3626.56] And then we get to pay respects?
[3626.90 → 3627.82] Project F in chat.
[3628.90 → 3632.58] And then a card game called Legends of Runeterra.
[3632.58 → 3634.20] It seems like they're just taking
[3634.20 → 3635.92] their IP of characters
[3635.92 → 3636.82] and just like,
[3636.90 → 3637.82] how many games can we put in?
[3637.82 → 3640.08] How much lore can we create?
[3640.32 → 3640.56] Yeah.
[3641.24 → 3642.72] Also an animated series,
[3642.92 → 3643.68] which is cool.
[3644.12 → 3646.08] And LOL Esports Manager,
[3646.30 → 3647.76] which I want to see if I was right about this
[3647.76 → 3649.16] because I have never clicked on this before.
[3649.60 → 3650.44] Build Your Legends.
[3650.58 → 3651.68] I think it is.
[3652.18 → 3652.56] Yep.
[3652.74 → 3653.04] Yep.
[3653.04 → 3656.38] So this is like FIFA Soccer Manager,
[3656.94 → 3659.66] but for FIFA Football Manager, whatever.
[3660.20 → 3661.64] But all the players pose like this.
[3663.32 → 3663.76] Actually.
[3664.42 → 3665.76] Actually, the ones in that picture.
[3665.76 → 3666.42] Oddly enough,
[3666.52 → 3667.82] they all have their arms straight down.
[3667.84 → 3668.56] That's really weird.
[3668.56 → 3671.98] But the Esports' thing is to 100%.
[3671.98 → 3672.20] Yeah.
[3672.30 → 3672.52] Yeah.
[3672.76 → 3672.96] Yeah.
[3673.12 → 3673.52] You're right.
[3674.22 → 3676.72] So that's actually kind of interesting.
[3676.84 → 3678.08] I have a feeling that'll do really well.
[3678.82 → 3679.44] So yeah.
[3680.90 → 3681.80] Thanks for watching, guys.
[3681.80 → 3682.04] See you later.
[3682.04 → 3683.16] It's entirely owned by Tencent.
[3683.30 → 3684.34] So they're trying to just, you know,
[3684.46 → 3685.12] own the whole world.
[3686.60 → 3687.00] Bye.
[3687.22 → 3687.50] Bye.
[3693.32 → 3695.76] Apparently missing a battle Royal is...
[3695.76 → 3700.84] Civilization was a battle Royal.
[3702.06 → 3702.54] Yes.
[3702.92 → 3703.32] It's kind of...
[3703.32 → 3703.50] Oh.
[3703.50 → 3703.56] Oh.
[3705.66 → 3706.12] Oh.
[3706.82 → 3707.32] Oh.
[3707.32 → 3707.66] Oh.
[3707.66 → 3707.92] Oh.
[3707.92 → 3708.18] Oh.
[3708.18 → 3708.20] Oh.
[3708.20 → 3708.24] Oh.
[3708.24 → 3708.26] Oh.
[3708.26 → 3708.28] Oh.
[3708.28 → 3708.32] Oh.
[3708.32 → 3708.36] Oh.
[3708.36 → 3708.44] Oh.
[3708.44 → 3708.46] Oh.
