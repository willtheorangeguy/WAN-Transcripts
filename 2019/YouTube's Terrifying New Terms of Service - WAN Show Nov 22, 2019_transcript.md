[0.00 --> 4.76]  Dot com slash live okay, sweet. That's not what I'm on so theoretically I
[5.44 --> 8.84]  Click done here and we are going to be streaming
[10.26 --> 15.28]  To you a wonderful ladies and gentlemen tuning into the WAN show Ray I
[16.08 --> 20.36]  Have no idea if this is working so guys we've got a great show for you today
[20.36 --> 22.98]  We're gonna be talking about the is it working? There's an ad
[24.06 --> 29.68]  Well YouTube is working exactly as intended good job YouTube. Yes, here we are wonderful
[29.68 --> 31.86]  So we've got a bunch of great topics for you guys today
[32.62 --> 37.98]  Naturally reaction to the Tesla truck. I don't think Luke and I are gonna agree on this one. So
[39.44 --> 46.56]  Yeah, that'll be interesting. Yeah, you're wrong and whatever it is you think you must be wrong opinions man
[46.56 --> 51.78]  No, you can have a wrong opinion. You can have a wrong opinion. You know what we can talk about that more later
[52.10 --> 57.00]  We are also going to talk about some of the changes to YouTube over the last little bit either
[57.00 --> 62.62]  I haven't been on the show right when it's happened or I just got distracted and did other things
[62.62 --> 67.44]  But I've had quite a few people asking me hey yo Linus usually you weigh in on this stuff
[67.44 --> 69.44]  Where's your take on the COPPA?
[70.24 --> 72.12]  ruling and you know
[72.12 --> 78.90]  Where's your take on the whole thing where YouTube can just like, you know shut down your channel if they deem it to be not financially viable?
[79.68 --> 81.68]  What else we got?
[81.68 --> 87.16]  I mean AMD confirming Zen 3 details Google Stadia thoughts
[88.44 --> 93.40]  Which was gonna be after stream, but apparently isn't anymore. Yeah, that's a bit of a lie now
[93.40 --> 97.18]  We were gonna do a stream earlier today trying it and then we were like
[98.36 --> 100.36]  Yeah
[100.36 --> 103.08]  So I was kind of thinking the thoughts well, I haven't tried it
[103.08 --> 109.22]  So I was actually kind of thinking maybe we'll get people who have actually tried it to come on and talk with us about it
[109.22 --> 109.84]  Yeah, yeah cool
[109.84 --> 114.32]  But we can still talk about things like the business model and all that and oh shoot
[114.32 --> 119.30]  That's not what you true. Yeah, let's just roll the intro forget it forget it
[119.30 --> 122.68]  Are we gonna talk about the thing wait a minute? What's going on here?
[123.24 --> 129.26]  There's only 85 people watching that seems a little low when I looked at it. Oh, no chats like going crazy
[129.26 --> 134.98]  Yeah, no, there's no way that's 85 people. Yeah, why why is your software so bad?
[135.74 --> 139.78]  Why is it so bad? Okay, hold on a second guys
[139.78 --> 144.48]  I just gotta I just gotta like show you guys what's going on here because it's just
[145.14 --> 149.94]  Okay, so YouTube has a new creators. I swear. I'll roll the intro in a bit. Okay
[150.66 --> 158.10]  So this computer screen or whatever we can help you there's nothing incriminating on here. So oh crap. Oh crap. Oh balls
[158.10 --> 160.64]  Uh, well, okay one second everyone
[163.78 --> 165.78]  What's happening
[165.98 --> 170.06]  What are you doing? I'm adding display capture just chill, okay, uh
[171.20 --> 173.52]  That's bad. That's bad. That's bad. Right. Why?
[176.16 --> 182.34]  That's fine. That's standard. Oh, I thought that was the other no, no, it's not I get it's not that it's all good
[182.34 --> 187.92]  Yeah, okay. I don't even know. I don't know why they would have that there anyway. It doesn't matter. Okay. Look so
[187.92 --> 191.84]  Here, what are we what are we looking at here? Why is this? Why is this like this?
[191.84 --> 192.34]  What the?
[192.34 --> 193.78]  What is even going on here?
[193.78 --> 197.20]  Oh, because the OBS is in the display capture
[198.20 --> 199.20]  So
[199.20 --> 203.88]  So it's gonna look whatever look at this terrible look at this terrible thing here, okay?
[204.18 --> 206.26]  So when you make an event
[206.88 --> 211.96]  You've got here. Is this the old live dashboard? Yeah, see this makes sense. Here's the old live dashboard
[212.18 --> 217.76]  Hey, you're live. Here's how long you've been live. Here's how many people are watching. Here's some chats
[217.76 --> 221.68]  Here's some super extra boosted chats
[222.32 --> 227.66]  Here's some stuff you said about your stream and like here's how things are going and in general, you know
[227.66 --> 234.02]  Everything this all makes sense. Now. Let's go to the new creator studio new creator studio, okay?
[234.54 --> 242.14]  So the preview is not working the concurrent viewers are obviously not working likes are not working new messages
[242.14 --> 246.12]  Apparently there are zero and I think chat probably has a word or two to say about that
[246.12 --> 251.04]  I don't know my favorite things about the likes is you actually do have exactly seven dislikes
[251.18 --> 254.56]  But not oh it and then it changed right when I said it. Yeah chat rev
[254.56 --> 261.76]  I don't know I don't even know what chat rev is short for mousing over normally on a sensible web page would tell me what's under this
[262.66 --> 268.18]  Ellipses here. No, no, okay. And then we've got some stream settings here. It's like, oh, yeah
[268.18 --> 275.66]  Thank goodness the 360 degree video button is front and center instead of you know how many people are watching the damn show
[278.42 --> 281.46]  Yeah, so we've got some inaccurate analytics I mean
[282.76 --> 284.76]  YouTube is rolling this thing out
[285.38 --> 293.30]  They are actually rolling this thing out to people in such a way that you cannot opt out that's happening in like a matter of weeks
[293.30 --> 295.80]  Oh God, that's how broken it is
[295.80 --> 297.80]  It's unbelievable
[297.80 --> 303.34]  It's unbelievable how broken it is. I love that. I love that no data
[303.94 --> 309.32]  Yeah, it's great. What even is that? I don't supposed to be I don't know what they don't supposed to be there
[309.32 --> 314.22]  We're gonna go we're gonna go back to this for a second. What is no why is there no data? What data should be there?
[314.22 --> 319.56]  We don't know we have no idea. What are we missing out on connect streaming software to start preview?
[319.56 --> 325.88]  What does that even mean nothing nothing we did this this is done we clicked done and it's not there?
[325.88 --> 330.62]  Oh, wait old dashboard working just fine, huh? How about that?
[331.16 --> 335.96]  Bit it's bizarre. I don't get it. I don't get it. I'm sorry land clearly. This is my fault
[335.96 --> 339.44]  I I'm at I'm at fault here. Let's roll the intro
[339.44 --> 347.92]  Isn't that unbelievable? That is kind of unbelievable. I tried to use the new dashboard
[348.40 --> 353.36]  Multiple times since they've been trying to push it on to people and I've never once had a good experience
[353.36 --> 359.36]  Well, I've just the reason I used it this week is because I've been trying to get rid of that issue where it
[360.00 --> 361.52]  Yeah, we'll talk about that
[361.52 --> 363.36]  For that in the doc if it's not in there already
[363.36 --> 370.40]  I've been I've been trying to get rid of that issue where the land show is showing up as having been broadcast a week before
[370.56 --> 375.92]  It's actually been broadcast. So here. Yeah, you know what? Let's let's go ahead. Let's show you guys that too
[375.92 --> 382.92]  So if we go on youtube.com slash Linus tech tips because I'm oh gee like that suckas got that
[383.16 --> 388.56]  Non slash see lame. Oh URL. So let's go into our videos here
[388.56 --> 394.72]  So this is wonderful. It's wonderful. Look at all these look at all these. Oh wow. We need to
[396.16 --> 398.80]  Scroll down from that. Yeah, this is all safe
[400.24 --> 405.04]  What well this shows videos that are not live. Oh, so don't worry about um
[406.16 --> 411.92]  Oh desktop capture is like never a good idea. Yeah, I know anyway the point is check this out
[412.48 --> 414.72]  uh, even more rise and leaks from
[414.72 --> 417.52]  Uh, six days ago. Uh, no
[418.24 --> 421.04]  Okay, well that was six days ago. So where's that? Where's the stupid one?
[421.84 --> 425.76]  Uh, china restricts playtime right a week ago. That's not right
[426.24 --> 432.00]  Why does why does that say a week ago? Why does this say a week ago? That doesn't make any sense?
[432.56 --> 435.44]  That wasn't a week ago. That was two weeks ago. That was november the 8th
[435.84 --> 442.88]  So we have this weird issue where the wan show doesn't know when it broadcast this was three weeks ago not two weeks ago
[442.88 --> 447.04]  So when it first goes up it shows up as um
[447.52 --> 448.40]  um
[448.40 --> 451.84]  Like like when it's just just live it shows that it was a week ago
[452.32 --> 457.84]  And then we look back now at the ones that are from a while ago and they show a week too late
[458.32 --> 460.32]  Yeah, like it doesn't know what's going on
[460.56 --> 465.84]  So that's the only thing wrong with the original dashboard version. That's the only thing that's wrong with it
[465.84 --> 467.84]  That's probably wrong with the new one, too
[467.84 --> 472.56]  So I'm gonna try the new one. You know the one you know the one redeeming
[473.60 --> 479.60]  Feature of the new dashboard is if you look up how to do something in the youtube dashboard
[480.00 --> 483.84]  That's the only one that they still have in the faqs. Yeah
[484.72 --> 489.68]  So if you don't remember how to do something you have to look it up then you have to use a new dashboard and that's
[490.80 --> 492.80]  great
[492.80 --> 497.12]  At least you can look up how to do something when it's impossible to figure out how to do it natively
[497.68 --> 498.56]  All right
[498.56 --> 502.56]  Should I just show people the coolest thing ever and should we talk about this?
[502.56 --> 509.12]  By the way this video this is difficult because there's a lot there's a lot more going on in this than like a normal
[509.36 --> 512.56]  You like you have a lot of noise happening in this video, sir
[513.20 --> 518.32]  There's a lot of reflections and there's a lot like there's not a ton of genuine static
[518.32 --> 526.00]  Image as a part of this. Oh, I see what you mean. Yeah, so it's a it's a noisy image. Yeah. Hey, Brandon
[526.64 --> 532.48]  You hear that? Luke doesn't like your cinematography of the Yule log. That's not what I'm saying. That is what you're saying
[532.48 --> 537.28]  I'm just saying it's difficult to handle. He shot it. Luke. Why are you so critical of Brandon?
[537.28 --> 541.60]  I'm not I love Brandon. I have a specific day for Brandon
[541.60 --> 542.72]  What's wrong with it?
[542.72 --> 547.28]  He says your image is very noisy. Oh, it's probably noisy. I didn't have enough light
[548.00 --> 553.28]  Well, there you go. That's actually why there you go, Luke. Yeah, so maybe you shouldn't be so unreasonable and be like
[553.28 --> 559.60]  I didn't I thought it was difficult to handle so anyway that video we promised it last year
[560.00 --> 563.04]  Thanks, Brandon. We ran into some technical difficulties
[563.68 --> 564.96]  because
[564.96 --> 572.24]  We are not willing to settle for uploading it at any less than 8k resolution
[572.96 --> 574.96]  Yeah, so
[575.52 --> 584.48]  Basically what that means is that we require a special exception from YouTube to upload a file that is way beyond their
[585.28 --> 587.44]  file upload size limit
[588.00 --> 588.80]  um
[588.80 --> 594.08]  Fortunately, we actually have another video service that we work with pretty closely here at Linus Media Group
[594.48 --> 597.04]  And we are hoping to have the Ulog available
[598.24 --> 600.24]  I have no idea
[600.24 --> 606.16]  Oh, well, yeah easy. Yeah, 4k. No, I mean, but that's that's it, right? No, you guys want to do 8k? Yeah
[606.56 --> 607.36]  Why?
[607.36 --> 608.32]  Because it's awesome
[608.88 --> 613.84]  So on the float plane side of things we're almost wondering how much we can melt your systems
[614.24 --> 618.08]  Uh, because we're genuinely not sure how many people in the audience are going to have a computer
[618.08 --> 623.36]  That's going to be able to watch something at the bit rates that float plane is going to want to output
[623.36 --> 625.20]  What are you guys targeting?
[625.20 --> 626.16]  Or 8k
[626.16 --> 628.24]  As 8k we're not even entirely sure yet
[628.64 --> 629.36]  You're a nerd
[629.52 --> 630.96]  We have to make sure that it's like
[630.96 --> 631.76]  You're a big nerd
[631.76 --> 637.12]  We have to make sure that it's like actually possible for at least like 2% of the audience
[637.12 --> 638.64]  So you guys did a test, right?
[639.28 --> 641.04]  Have you tried playing back 8k?
[641.84 --> 643.44]  Uh, not at the bit rate that we want
[643.44 --> 646.96]  Okay, how'd it do at the bit rate that isn't what you want?
[647.76 --> 649.60]  Uh, well, we haven't actually done that either
[649.60 --> 655.60]  Okay, we've been we've been trying to plan like exactly how we want to set it up. Okay, right now we're working on like
[656.48 --> 658.48]  Transcoding it properly, which is its own
[659.44 --> 661.44]  Problem. Yeah, because here's the thing guys
[661.84 --> 669.12]  H.264 has a resolution limit. Yeah, so you can't just use h.264 encoding to create an 8k video
[669.12 --> 672.88]  So you've got a couple of options. There's vp9, which is like
[673.44 --> 683.68]  Okay, and then there's h.265 except that that is stuck in like patent hell
[683.68 --> 686.16]  The h.265 specifically yeah, so yeah
[686.64 --> 690.72]  So we're gonna have to play it in something that we don't normally play stuff in which is not a huge deal
[690.88 --> 696.00]  But there's some like learning steps that we want to take before we actually post a video learning steps
[696.40 --> 698.88]  Yeah, learning steps. Okay. All right, fine, whatever
[699.04 --> 702.80]  You know what? We should do the topic that we promised the people at the beginning of the video here
[702.80 --> 706.64]  Let's talk about the polygonal
[707.52 --> 709.52]  The polygonal pickup
[709.52 --> 713.92]  Uh, why why is why do I not have a network connection?
[714.24 --> 718.24]  Why is this laptop horrible? I'm really glad we didn't give this thing a good review. I got it
[718.88 --> 721.28]  All right, I'm bringing up. I'm bringing up Luke's screen here
[721.60 --> 726.88]  I don't know if this is the greatest website for images, but it's showing whatever. It's all good. All right, the tesla
[727.68 --> 729.44]  Cyber truck
[729.44 --> 733.60]  Electrifies the truck segment. I hadn't seen it from this angle yet. Me neither. It is so
[734.32 --> 735.68]  Me neither
[735.68 --> 737.68]  You know what it reminds me of?
[738.16 --> 744.08]  There was this game that I used to play on the max in our computer our school computer lab
[744.64 --> 746.80]  Um, I think it was called spectre
[748.24 --> 750.24]  I think it was called spectre
[751.12 --> 756.32]  Yeah, here it is. Okay, spectre gameplay pc game 1991 apparently it was available for pc
[756.80 --> 762.56]  Um, can I just can I just screen share with you for a second here? So I want to give a shout out to squake net
[763.04 --> 768.40]  Uh, youtube channel for having this gameplay of this truly classic game here
[769.28 --> 776.72]  It reminds me of the tanks in this game. Oh my god. Yeah. Oh, I haven't seen this in forever. So where where are they?
[778.00 --> 780.16]  This is this is what I am reminded of
[781.60 --> 784.88]  And I don't know if this is yeah. Yeah, I'm pretty sure this is the game
[784.88 --> 786.88]  I think the mac version looked a little different
[787.44 --> 793.44]  Or there maybe they're just operating it in a different mode. So if I recall correctly you could um, oh wait
[793.44 --> 796.08]  Yeah, you could set it to uh wireframe
[796.72 --> 805.52]  Instead of uh, like solid panels. Okay, and so yeah, the tanks basically looked like like yeah, see that does that not look like the cyber truck?
[807.20 --> 809.20]  That's what I'm reminded of
[809.20 --> 813.28]  Go back to your screen for a second here. Yeah, this I had not seen this angle either
[813.36 --> 818.80]  They definitely chose the worst angle I've ever seen is this truck as their cover photo. Holy
[818.80 --> 824.88]  The worst thing about this is that's probably how you're often gonna see it. Yeah
[825.84 --> 826.40]  Yeah
[827.52 --> 834.72]  And like is it just me or is the bed really small and doesn't have like a lift gate? Okay, uh
[835.60 --> 840.56]  A lift gate. Yeah, what do you mean? Or tailgate. It has a tailgate. Does it? Okay
[840.72 --> 845.60]  The tailgate has like a ramp built into it or at least that might be an option or something. I'm not sure
[845.60 --> 849.84]  Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, okay tailgate itself is actually very cool, okay?
[850.72 --> 853.92]  Um, so my biggest problem with the truck sure is
[854.88 --> 856.88]  We need a
[856.88 --> 862.48]  What's your biggest problem with the truck so okay? I can I can see oh there's 37 photos in here okay?
[862.64 --> 866.64]  All right, fine. I'm going back to your screen back to your screen. I will find a foot here
[867.60 --> 870.88]  Ignore the smashed windows which is a whole different part of the conversation
[870.88 --> 875.84]  But this part you guys can see my most on there. Yeah, this whole section right here. Yeah
[876.24 --> 882.72]  Immediately makes it very difficult also known as probably impossible to work out of slash load from the side
[883.28 --> 884.24]  mm-hmm
[884.24 --> 885.92]  That's like
[885.92 --> 891.12]  Seems like a massive oversight in my opinion. I don't know what's going on there
[892.16 --> 893.52]  but
[893.52 --> 900.72]  Yeah, other than that until I saw these photos, I wasn't that against how it looked to be completely honest
[900.96 --> 903.76]  Yeah, I don't think it's a conventionally
[904.72 --> 906.72]  attractive
[906.80 --> 911.84]  Truck by any means, but I think it's interesting. I really like the light bar actually
[912.24 --> 916.96]  Okay, and like watching it drive down the street with that light bar on yeah, like yeah, wow
[917.04 --> 918.72]  That's an amazing amount of illumination
[918.72 --> 926.40]  So there's definitely stuff that the rest of the automotive industry is going to have to react to here the sledgehammer demo
[927.28 --> 930.56]  Pretty impressive pretty cool. I mean it really does is pretty cool
[930.56 --> 935.92]  It that's very cool. I actually really like no paint. It really does raise the question, you know
[936.96 --> 940.80]  Why has nobody built a truck that you know doesn't get?
[941.52 --> 946.08]  Doesn't have the paint flake off the second you look at it too hard on a work site
[946.08 --> 950.88]  Yeah, why did it take Tesla to come up to come up with the idea of that?
[951.20 --> 956.64]  You know not everyone drives their truck to soccer practice. Yeah, so that's pretty cool
[959.20 --> 965.44]  Have you seen the camping thing I actually can I say something maybe unpopular sure I actually like the interior?
[966.64 --> 967.60]  Because
[967.60 --> 973.04]  Driving I remember this is this is quite a few years back this when I still worked at NCIX
[973.04 --> 977.20]  So it must have been about seven eight years ago and I borrowed the company work van
[978.24 --> 978.64]  um
[978.64 --> 986.48]  And I got in and I was blown away by how bare bones and even been like
[987.12 --> 988.32]  15 years ago
[989.04 --> 994.40]  Everything about the interior of this thing looked and felt like it was so plasticky and so crappy
[994.40 --> 999.84]  And like, you know dials like this instead of you know nice knobs for things
[999.84 --> 1001.76]  I was just looking at it going this is
[1002.56 --> 1009.92]  This is ridiculous like why is there a different standard what people who and even our even our f-150 the work truck
[1009.92 --> 1012.32]  Have you driven it? Yeah, like compared to
[1013.20 --> 1016.80]  You know a sedan or something. It's like what people who?
[1017.76 --> 1018.80]  Work
[1018.80 --> 1022.88]  You know when our you know with like tools in the back of their truck
[1023.52 --> 1028.56]  They don't want buttons that don't feel like two decades ago like I don't really get it
[1028.56 --> 1030.56]  Like why don't you just kind of stuff actually?
[1030.80 --> 1036.00]  Um, i'm struggling to remember the name of it, but the the toyota truck that's super popular tacoma
[1036.24 --> 1040.80]  Toyota tacoma. Yeah, uh, it hasn't had an interior update in like forever
[1041.52 --> 1045.92]  And they they did one with a similar vehicle that they have in their product line
[1045.92 --> 1051.76]  Everyone freaking hated it because the stuff just kind of works and they don't want to mess around with
[1052.88 --> 1056.24]  Like electronical stuff as much they'd rather use buttons and dials
[1057.04 --> 1061.92]  Which I kind of understand if it's a work truck and you're like I just need the thing that i'm pressing to function
[1062.80 --> 1067.44]  With the irony being that our fan only does off and full blast in our ford
[1067.44 --> 1072.96]  So that's true that the dial is clearly not doing us a lot of good here because it's true still electronical control
[1072.96 --> 1077.04]  That is a ford versus toyota no fair enough, which is a different conversation
[1077.92 --> 1079.12]  Okay, can you switch my screen?
[1079.12 --> 1082.64]  Yeah, I'll show you guys a couple things all right all right this I think is very cool
[1083.60 --> 1088.56]  This is really cool the charging okay the atv that charges in the back is the coolest thing i've ever seen in my life
[1089.76 --> 1091.76]  The ramp tailgate
[1091.76 --> 1097.60]  Yep, super cool. Yeah, the fact that it looks like it's like tilting up to help you get the quad out
[1098.24 --> 1101.68]  Yep, pretty freaking cool. That's very cool. It has onboard
[1102.56 --> 1104.80]  air compression it has like the
[1105.60 --> 1111.12]  Amazing amount of output on the battery that you can use for things that aren't just the vehicle obviously the camping stuff
[1112.40 --> 1114.40]  This is super cool
[1116.32 --> 1118.72]  That's awesome nobody is gonna do that
[1119.28 --> 1123.04]  I guarantee you people will do okay people will do that but they are pathetic tesla fanboys
[1123.04 --> 1125.04]  Ha ha ha why?
[1126.48 --> 1128.24]  It's stupid. Why is it stupid?
[1128.88 --> 1131.44]  Just pitch the tent on the ground
[1133.04 --> 1135.04]  It's not camping
[1136.48 --> 1137.68]  What do you think of hammocks then?
[1138.32 --> 1139.68]  Hammocks are sweet
[1139.68 --> 1142.48]  But there's like almost no setup time on a hammock and it's not on the ground
[1143.44 --> 1143.60]  So
[1145.92 --> 1148.48]  Like but that counts you expect me to object to a hammock?
[1148.48 --> 1150.08]  Why would I?
[1150.08 --> 1152.56]  But like this probably has more setup time than a hammock
[1153.12 --> 1156.96]  So it's not about the setup time it's not like i'm not like oh
[1157.52 --> 1160.40]  This is not camping because there's not enough setup time
[1160.40 --> 1162.48]  But you're in a tent on a board like you're not in the vehicle
[1163.60 --> 1165.44]  This is this is tent material you can tell
[1165.44 --> 1168.88]  I can tell what it's made of i still think it's stupid
[1170.00 --> 1170.80]  No, it's stupid
[1170.80 --> 1171.44]  I want to see it
[1171.44 --> 1173.52]  I want to see what the audience thinks
[1174.08 --> 1176.40]  You can see what they think if you want all right let's
[1176.40 --> 1176.56]  Let's
[1176.56 --> 1178.08]  The tent is not closed
[1178.08 --> 1178.48]  Brandon
[1179.60 --> 1181.92]  Brandon when's the last time you went camping in your life
[1182.80 --> 1183.92]  Like four years ago
[1183.92 --> 1184.88]  Yeah, that's what I thought
[1184.88 --> 1185.52]  What about you?
[1185.52 --> 1186.48]  Yeah, that's what I thought
[1186.48 --> 1187.12]  What about you?
[1187.12 --> 1188.24]  I went camping this summer
[1188.56 --> 1189.12]  Okay
[1189.12 --> 1191.20]  I only stayed for like a night
[1191.20 --> 1193.04]  But that was we were gonna do two nights
[1193.04 --> 1195.04]  But then I got called away on a secret mission
[1196.24 --> 1197.44]  Basically a sponsor
[1198.32 --> 1198.88]  offered us
[1200.72 --> 1203.28]  Way way more like it was like triple
[1203.28 --> 1204.48]  Our normal rate
[1204.48 --> 1207.28]  And I was like well, I do really have a camping trip with my children
[1207.84 --> 1212.96]  And then I was like well, they'll probably forgive me and still love me because this is like
[1214.16 --> 1216.48]  Yeah, I'm gonna cover a lot of expenses
[1217.60 --> 1218.88]  Yep, make it up to you kids
[1220.08 --> 1221.44]  Yeah, so I only stayed one night
[1222.24 --> 1223.52]  I'm not into camping either
[1223.52 --> 1225.76]  I just mean if you're gonna camp do it properly
[1225.76 --> 1226.96]  That's my point
[1226.96 --> 1230.24]  So anyway, the single engine rear-wheel drive has a 250 mile range
[1230.24 --> 1234.48]  A 7500 pound towing capacity and does zero to 60 in six and a half seconds
[1234.96 --> 1238.88]  40,000 dollars is way more aggressive than I expected and honestly
[1238.88 --> 1243.44]  I think I'm probably not the only one that is surprised by that because
[1243.44 --> 1249.12]  I was reading up on some of the speculation about the super cyber, you know extra
[1249.12 --> 1250.80]  It's way more expensive than you thought?
[1250.80 --> 1251.76]  It's less than I thought
[1251.76 --> 1252.24]  Okay, yeah
[1252.24 --> 1255.04]  A lot of the analysis and a lot of the predictions that I saw
[1255.52 --> 1258.32]  Said that they thought Elon was out of his gourd
[1258.32 --> 1260.08]  Off his gourd out of his rocker, whatever
[1260.08 --> 1263.44]  The point is they thought he was crazy when he was saying look it needs to be under 50 grand
[1263.76 --> 1264.48]  They thought he meant
[1265.04 --> 1266.48]  49.99
[1266.48 --> 1267.28]  Yeah
[1267.28 --> 1269.04]  Nine, whatever how many nines that is
[1270.32 --> 1272.96]  And they still thought that that was really aggressive
[1273.68 --> 1275.92]  So most people think the tent is is cool
[1275.92 --> 1276.96]  Yeah, well you know what
[1276.96 --> 1278.00]  But not by a lot
[1278.00 --> 1280.96]  Just because everyone thinks something doesn't mean that it's right
[1280.96 --> 1281.44]  That's fair
[1282.16 --> 1285.76]  Okay, so the dual engine all-wheel drive has a 300 mile range
[1285.76 --> 1291.12]  10,000 pound towing capacity and a zero to 60 in four and a half seconds for just another 10 grand
[1291.12 --> 1294.72]  I think that's probably going to be the one then the three engine
[1295.60 --> 1297.20]  500 mile range
[1297.20 --> 1301.44]  14,000 pound towing capacity zero to 60 in 2.9 quarter mile in 10 seconds
[1301.44 --> 1305.76]  This thing is a speed demon and that'll cost you a cool 70 000
[1305.76 --> 1307.04]  That will also sell pretty well
[1307.04 --> 1312.00]  I've been talking to my brother who drives like big trucks for the movies and stuff
[1312.40 --> 1313.84]  Yeah, when they have to get generators
[1314.56 --> 1316.00]  out of like
[1316.00 --> 1321.04]  Buried in the mud after like a what like many days of rain after it was parked there forever
[1321.12 --> 1322.32]  ago and the thing weighs like
[1322.96 --> 1327.12]  Obscene amounts because it's not like little toy generator. They're generators for entire sets
[1327.76 --> 1328.64]  um
[1328.64 --> 1332.24]  They like he's he's told me stories of them taking like super duties
[1332.88 --> 1334.56]  And like going for runs
[1335.36 --> 1338.00]  Like trying to slam these generators over the mud and stuff
[1338.56 --> 1339.12]  Really?
[1339.12 --> 1344.96]  Like and then like that one gets stuck and they have to make like a train of trucks to pull all the other trucks and the generator out and like
[1345.68 --> 1349.92]  They need as much as they can possibly get and he has like a f-150
[1349.92 --> 1353.04]  Yeah, and there's people on his crew that are like, you know like
[1353.68 --> 1358.48]  You might need a bigger truck because like some of the stuff we have to haul is like a little too much for it
[1359.04 --> 1362.16]  Right sometimes it is but he's not going to go buy an insanely expensive truck
[1362.72 --> 1367.44]  So like whatever but like those will sell the three engines will absolutely sell
[1369.04 --> 1369.52]  I don't know
[1370.56 --> 1372.56]  And it's interesting
[1372.56 --> 1375.20]  I do I i'm kind of mixed
[1375.92 --> 1377.92]  On my opinions of it because I I don't think
[1379.12 --> 1383.52]  I didn't originally think it looked that bad. I think shots like this the one with the quad in it
[1385.12 --> 1386.64]  Actually make it look pretty cool
[1387.60 --> 1389.84]  So I mean here's the main question though
[1390.40 --> 1393.76]  What are they trying to achieve here?
[1394.72 --> 1400.88]  Why did they do this because they could have just as easily done a more conventional ish truck?
[1401.52 --> 1405.60]  That was electric and people would have bought it for sure for sure
[1405.76 --> 1411.36]  So my yeah original idea when I saw it yeah was oh manufacturing reasons
[1412.56 --> 1418.24]  Do you think it's cheaper to do this angular design? I mean not do you think actually it's very likely cheaper. I am
[1418.24 --> 1423.68]  Thinking that it's probably cheaper. Yeah, I'm also thinking that it's probably more reliable and easier
[1424.40 --> 1429.84]  Hmm and what he's been talking about for a long time is we're gonna put out more vehicles we're gonna put more vehicles
[1429.84 --> 1431.12]  We're gonna put more vehicles. Yeah, where are they?
[1431.12 --> 1434.80]  This doesn't have crazy wing doors. Yeah, it doesn't have all this other stuff
[1435.04 --> 1438.08]  It doesn't have fancy curved paneling or any of that kind of stuff
[1438.08 --> 1441.76]  There's like two polygons on a lot of different sections on here
[1441.76 --> 1444.16]  There's like one bend of the metal and that's a whole section
[1444.48 --> 1448.16]  Yeah, and like getting that stuff out reliably and easily it's not even painted
[1448.80 --> 1452.80]  Yeah, which is great like that's a good thing in this case, but
[1453.60 --> 1458.80]  I think they will i'm hoping this means they'll be able to churn them out a lot faster
[1459.36 --> 1463.20]  So this could maybe be the the vehicle that they like whip off the line. You know what I mean?
[1464.16 --> 1465.84]  Interesting so
[1467.92 --> 1472.32]  On stage, uh, the team hit the steel alloy body with a sledgehammer to no effect
[1472.32 --> 1477.76]  They're using the same cold rolled steel alloy as spacex used for its mars rocket prototype
[1478.32 --> 1481.20]  Musk claims it can withstand a bullet from a nine millimeter pistol
[1481.76 --> 1484.00]  Their armored glass demo failed but okay
[1485.20 --> 1488.72]  I'm gonna pitch you something sort of I think they did it on purpose
[1489.44 --> 1491.04]  I've heard a lot of rumors about that
[1491.04 --> 1497.04]  I think musk is smart enough at this point savvy enough at this point that
[1498.56 --> 1499.52]  He knows
[1500.88 --> 1502.96]  That failed stage demos
[1504.40 --> 1506.40]  Last a lifetime. Yeah
[1507.04 --> 1512.08]  At some critical moment where he would he was too cool in that moment. I will give you that for sure
[1512.64 --> 1514.08]  Sorry, I mean
[1514.80 --> 1522.00]  You know developers developers developers or uh, you know, what was the what was the one with jobs when he was unveiling?
[1523.28 --> 1525.60]  Shoot. There's a super famous one with steve jobs
[1525.60 --> 1528.48]  This is not the speech recognition thing is it?
[1528.48 --> 1529.20]  I can't remember
[1529.20 --> 1530.64]  Because they just cheated for that
[1530.64 --> 1532.56]  Yeah, I can't remember it doesn't matter anyway
[1532.88 --> 1536.72]  There have been ones with apple there's been ones with microsoft they're they're iconic
[1536.96 --> 1538.16]  They last forever
[1538.16 --> 1541.52]  Oh, yeah, and what they do is two things they get
[1542.56 --> 1547.44]  Everyone posting about it everyone talking about it because like
[1549.20 --> 1550.88]  You know what happened? Yeah, I saw it happened
[1551.12 --> 1559.20]  So everyone is looking at this event that brings in more eyeballs and more people that are looking at an article that yeah sure has that as the like clickbait, you know
[1559.92 --> 1564.72]  Thumbnail and title and whatever but also contains information about this product
[1564.72 --> 1570.56]  And it still took a large metal ball to the window and didn't shatter and
[1571.12 --> 1578.80]  Number two is it creates an opportunity to talk about something twice. Yeah, when it doesn't work the first time
[1580.08 --> 1582.72]  You get a bunch of people talking about it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, then
[1584.16 --> 1586.40]  Three months down the line or six months down the line
[1587.04 --> 1594.56]  You come out and you go hey remember that thing that was a cultural event that everybody knows about and everyone is
[1594.72 --> 1595.76]  You know
[1595.76 --> 1599.68]  Maybe at least idly curious how it turned out guess what we fixed it
[1600.72 --> 1607.12]  I think it was a hundred percent on purpose and i'm not normally like a tinfoil hat conspiracy theory kind of person
[1607.44 --> 1613.84]  But there is no way that they didn't know what was going to happen. Yeah when they hit the glass with a steel ball
[1614.96 --> 1616.96]  No way
[1617.76 --> 1623.12]  And they they they talked in about in there like my drop boom gun you're done
[1623.12 --> 1625.12]  You change the scene
[1626.16 --> 1629.44]  Back in their official statement thing they even mentioned about how they like
[1629.92 --> 1631.84]  Threw tons of other stuff at the glass
[1632.16 --> 1635.04]  Yeah, and they don't even specify that they threw the ball at the glass
[1635.36 --> 1639.44]  And like the chance that they never tried that before they did it on stage is so low. Yeah, it's zero
[1640.00 --> 1642.00]  It's zero so I don't know um
[1642.64 --> 1644.64]  Also, it's still a really impressive demo
[1644.88 --> 1649.12]  So so says it looks like elon is using the sonic movie strategy. I
[1649.68 --> 1651.68]  I don't believe that that was intentional
[1653.92 --> 1655.04]  Yeah, I don't think that was intentional
[1655.04 --> 1659.12]  So cameron says does the demo nearly bulletproof sell it to law enforcement. Oh, yeah
[1660.00 --> 1667.04]  Oh, yeah for sure because I mean law enforcement is a perfect example of an industry where they want very very
[1667.60 --> 1668.00]  uh
[1668.00 --> 1673.84]  low fleet maintenance and low total cost of ownership was reading another really interesting article from a company
[1673.84 --> 1677.36]  I forget what they're called unfortunately, but they've been using the transit
[1678.16 --> 1682.96]  The tesla transit company or whatever they're called. I don't remember tesla tes cab or something
[1683.28 --> 1686.96]  They only use tesla vehicles and they have like over 300 000 miles on all their vehicles. Yeah, yeah
[1686.96 --> 1687.28]  Yeah, yeah, yeah
[1687.28 --> 1692.64]  Yeah, and like the the maintenance was like basically nothing. Yeah, none of the battery packs have actually worn out
[1692.72 --> 1695.84]  I think the worst was like a 28 reduction in range or something like that
[1696.32 --> 1698.32]  uh 20 something and
[1698.32 --> 1704.08]  Like none of them had needed a motor replaced and the total cost of ownership over the lifetime of the vehicle because they were going to get
[1704.40 --> 1713.04]  An estimated like 500 000 miles per vehicle versus a typical hundred thousand on a fleet vehicle for an internal combustion engine was like
[1713.68 --> 1720.64]  Way lower. It's like way lower. And so I could see law enforcement. I mean it's got the speed. Oh, yeah
[1720.64 --> 1725.04]  It's got the ruggedness. It's got the lower total cost of ownership
[1725.84 --> 1730.24]  Assuming that it all hands out even a critical design flaw you could even just do partial paint
[1731.12 --> 1736.32]  Oh, yeah, for sure for sure like accent paint. Yeah get some of them lights on there. I would be man
[1736.32 --> 1739.84]  I would be floored if they okay, okay
[1739.92 --> 1741.68]  I know there are questions about what it looks like
[1741.84 --> 1746.88]  But one of those as a cop vehicle would probably look freaking sick. That's true
[1746.88 --> 1748.88]  as like
[1748.88 --> 1754.88]  Like as like a space space like like futuristic sci-fi movie
[1754.88 --> 1763.28]  Yeah, like that's what the cops ride around 100 100 percent. Yep. Okay. I'm sold now. Yeah law enforcement vehicle done
[1764.32 --> 1769.76]  Everything else is done. You're done. That's it. It's done. It's awesome. It's officially awesome now
[1769.76 --> 1775.60]  I still I still have my concerns about the the angled parts by the by the truck bed
[1775.60 --> 1778.32]  I still have lots of concerns, but there's some real stuff. I mean
[1779.12 --> 1782.64]  110 220 volt outlets the those are sick
[1783.20 --> 1788.48]  The size of the bed is about like an f-150 not as wide which might be a bit of a pain in the butt for certain things
[1788.64 --> 1789.60]  Yeah
[1789.60 --> 1792.16]  Um, I guess that's pretty much all I have to say about that
[1792.16 --> 1795.60]  Why don't we move on to one of the other big topics that I wanted to talk actually wow
[1795.60 --> 1797.60]  We talked about that for so long
[1797.60 --> 1801.12]  I was gonna say I have to do our sponsors just to wall. Oh, no, okay
[1801.12 --> 1805.76]  Just to make sure we get through them. Yeah, just a reminder. We have to do
[1806.80 --> 1812.08]  This one. Yeah, and we have to do you have to talk about PIA that one. Yeah, yeah, for sure
[1812.64 --> 1816.40]  Uh, where the heck are the where the heck are the sponsors for the show? Here they are. Ah
[1817.76 --> 1819.76]  Moss back back
[1820.32 --> 1825.52]  I'm gonna do it again. Wow. This is a Luke sized one. Oh, no, this is something we haven't seen before
[1825.52 --> 1832.64]  Is this like a black pack like XL or something? Ah, this is the new black pack grande
[1833.20 --> 1836.32]  Feel the back things. Ah, that's a lot better. Yeah, sure
[1838.48 --> 1842.96]  Huh, well, these are quite similar to the ones on the smaller ones. Oh, okay. You just haven't used the black pack before you think
[1842.96 --> 1848.56]  Yeah, no these they're nice. They don't feel stupid. No, I didn't mean it that way. They seem nice. Yeah, I know they're awesome
[1848.56 --> 1855.20]  Uh, so wow, this is like it's a bigger black pack. Is the inside still orange? Got a got a big old head that needs big old glasses
[1855.44 --> 1859.68]  Check out how deep this glasses pocket is. Oh my goodness. That's ridiculous. Yeah
[1859.92 --> 1865.68]  The inside is still orange so you can find like cables and junk that's buried at the bottom of your bag. It fits up to a 17
[1866.16 --> 1873.84]  Inch laptop. It's got all the stuff you'd expect from moss like the built-in power bank and cable management and all that kind of cool stuff

[1879.92 --> 1883.40]  It's resistant to abrasion and tearing basically. It's freaking awesome
[1883.40 --> 1890.60]  But it's bigger than ever and the external water bottle pocket right here actually fits the linus tech tips water bottle

[2034.62 --> 2041.18]  I promise not to eat the other ones. I will put them here. So I forget about them out of sight out of mind. Um, I
[2041.70 --> 2043.20]  Took this one
[2043.20 --> 2045.98]  Camping with me last time I went it was fantastic
[2046.74 --> 2049.86]  It's wonderful and like everyone there liked it. Yeah, you know
[2049.86 --> 2053.54]  That's because you didn't show up and try to camp in the back of your truck because that would have been stupid
[2053.54 --> 2057.14]  Yeah, I slept on the rocks and it was actually the best sleep I've had in like a really long time
[2059.50 --> 2061.50]  I'm not hitting on the cyber truck
[2061.50 --> 2066.02]  I'm hitting on people that think they're gonna camp in it and call that camping. Oh, yeah, that's dumb. That's dumb
[2066.02 --> 2070.34]  But it's a really cool vehicle honestly. All right, so the new YouTube terms of service
[2071.30 --> 2075.56]  YouTube is rolling out updated terms of service on December the 10th in new tube. I
[2077.16 --> 2079.16]  Like it
[2079.38 --> 2082.38]  All right, that's what you can call the terrible new dashboard
[2082.38 --> 2084.38]  New tube
[2085.50 --> 2089.06]  Okay, including a reminder that here we go. This is a quote
[2089.68 --> 2096.14]  YouTube is under no obligation to host or serve content that is that is directly pulled from the new terms of service
[2096.76 --> 2099.56]  So various youtubers have tweeted out a segment that states
[2100.60 --> 2107.78]  YouTube may terminate your access or your Google accounts access to all or part of the service if YouTube believes
[2107.78 --> 2115.42]  In its sole discretion that provision of the service to you is no longer commercially viable
[2116.46 --> 2121.18]  Can I just stand up here for a second with an incredibly unpopular opinion if you stand up?
[2121.18 --> 2123.88]  I'm not gonna be out of the frame. Yeah, that's fair. Okay, can I
[2125.34 --> 2127.34]  Free country sounds good
[2127.90 --> 2130.30]  Actually, speaking of it's a free country. They're a business
[2130.30 --> 2132.30]  They can absolutely do this
[2134.54 --> 2141.30]  Mm-hmm. I think I think a lot of people look at YouTube especially because they have basically no competitors, which is a problem
[2141.58 --> 2143.92]  But that's more of the problem than this
[2145.64 --> 2149.72]  Because like they're not a government service they they can absolutely do that
[2150.94 --> 2156.66]  They're a company if something that they're doing is not commercially viable in a lot of situations. They're gonna not do it
[2156.66 --> 2161.22]  They're a publicly traded company, so especially yes
[2163.28 --> 2166.04]  Like we you guys run the forum still
[2166.62 --> 2171.22]  Yeah, it's not a commercially viable thing. No, it's really not you do some stuff that isn't commercially viable
[2171.66 --> 2173.90]  But like it's at our sole discretion exactly
[2175.26 --> 2178.64]  If we decided one day to turn off the forum there's nothing you guys can do about it
[2178.64 --> 2182.04]  So if it was in our terms of service that we can turn it off if it's no longer commercially viable
[2182.04 --> 2185.90]  That's perfectly reasonable and we could turn off like a singular sub forum
[2185.90 --> 2187.90]  Or something however
[2187.90 --> 2189.90]  I
[2190.54 --> 2194.58]  Think there is I don't think it's the right stance. Okay, it's totally like
[2195.54 --> 2201.42]  Yeah, I think there is still room for people to feel uncomfortable about this of course
[2201.42 --> 2203.42]  You should like you said
[2204.14 --> 2210.88]  Because YouTube is basically a monopoly yes when it comes to online video services that are
[2210.88 --> 2215.10]  Accessible to everyone and and has has positioned themselves
[2215.74 --> 2219.54]  You tube you know like you you just you tube it, you know
[2220.06 --> 2225.72]  So they position it's changing I think I think this sorry to interject again. This feels kind of like this is
[2225.72 --> 2227.72]  Google
[2227.72 --> 2229.72]  a little bit
[2229.72 --> 2233.72]  This feels like when Google dropped the don't be evil moniker love it
[2234.72 --> 2236.72]  And that's they're right yes, absolutely
[2237.12 --> 2241.10]  But they're losing that thing that really made them feel like
[2241.82 --> 2247.44]  What they were it's losing its identity a little bit. Yes. Yeah, so if the idea is that it's you tube
[2247.44 --> 2250.34]  And it's then they it's it's on them
[2250.34 --> 2255.50]  It's their fault that people are mad about this because people wouldn't be upset if YouTube hadn't positioned themselves
[2255.64 --> 2263.68]  First as long as like the public access channel as basically a you did video as a utility and you can know what I mean
[2263.68 --> 2265.68]  Oh, yeah, yeah, it was a basic human right
[2265.68 --> 2271.10]  It's like everyone should be able to upload to YouTube which again the wording their video is a basic human right
[2271.10 --> 2278.28]  It's not it's not it's not a government thing, but yes, they did make it seem like as a private enterprise they
[2279.90 --> 2287.04]  Basically did it for so long that if they kind of go oh well hold on about that actually could we just
[2289.00 --> 2291.00]  Well, I can see how people would feel betrayed
[2291.74 --> 2297.42]  Yes, and that is in the same vein of this is not a government thing they can do whatever they want
[2297.42 --> 2303.76]  Absolutely feel betrayed because you can also do that like that's you got to understand
[2303.76 --> 2305.22]  I'm saying kind of both sides here
[2305.22 --> 2308.06]  I would be extremely annoyed if I was still a YouTube creator
[2308.06 --> 2311.34]  I would feel very uncomfortable and I would try to join flow point
[2311.34 --> 2313.76]  But like yeah, you know
[2314.48 --> 2315.48]  so
[2315.48 --> 2319.54]  Okay now with that said I do think some of the reaction to this is
[2320.60 --> 2322.20]  totally
[2322.20 --> 2326.38]  Ridiculous, I mean one of the first things that I saw here was like
[2326.38 --> 2328.38]  You know the the usual
[2329.18 --> 2331.50]  the usual suspects when it comes to
[2334.70 --> 2340.86]  Sort of taking a change in policy and finding it a way to turn it into like personal persecution
[2341.54 --> 2345.30]  Yeah, so you know one of one of the classic groups there and to be clear
[2345.30 --> 2350.58]  I am not saying that they have never been targeted with policy changes
[2350.58 --> 2353.76]  I'm just saying that sometimes because of that history
[2353.76 --> 2358.32]  They have a tendency to see a new policy change and assume that it's all about them
[2358.32 --> 2363.68]  When actually this probably has nothing to do with you and I think gun youtubers are a perfect example of that here
[2363.68 --> 2364.24]  Okay
[2364.24 --> 2368.30]  I saw gun youtubers coming out and saying well hey this is YouTube
[2368.30 --> 2375.66]  Basically saying that if they can't sell enough you know bullet ads to go in front of my videos
[2375.90 --> 2380.18]  Then they're just gonna turn off my channel and terminate my access to the service
[2380.42 --> 2383.14]  Well gosh darn it. I don't like that and
[2384.06 --> 2386.06]  Technically you're not wrong
[2386.36 --> 2393.18]  But that that is that is like that is the farthest thing that that's so far away from how YouTube
[2393.18 --> 2397.18]  would be exp- how I would expect YouTube to utilize
[2398.06 --> 2399.18]  this
[2399.18 --> 2401.18]  This wording in their terms of service like
[2401.66 --> 2404.66]  That's not what they're gonna do with it. That's not what it's for
[2405.14 --> 2411.36]  You got to remember that there's a much broader world out there full of totally different concerns
[2411.46 --> 2414.46]  Than even the type of content on the channel
[2414.46 --> 2419.74]  I would say it is very likely that this policy change has nothing to do
[2419.74 --> 2428.58]  What the type of content of the person whose account they terminate or whose videos they remove and the reason I would say that is because
[2429.74 --> 2432.22]  Here's an example some people don't realize this
[2433.74 --> 2440.70]  There are people out there that are using YouTube as basically their own personal cloud storage. Oh, yeah, we're free. Yeah
[2440.70 --> 2448.80]  It's like oh well, why would I pay for I do it Google photos or iCloud or whatever if I can just take all of my videos and just
[2448.80 --> 2450.80]  upload them
[2450.80 --> 2452.80]  private to YouTube
[2452.80 --> 2454.80]  Yeah, where it's free and then i'll just like
[2455.80 --> 2459.56]  Download them if I need it. Yeah, or I'll like watch them when I want
[2460.12 --> 2467.92]  Well, that's that's not what the service is for and that was never what the service was for yeah, but unless YouTube has
[2469.08 --> 2474.74]  Policy in place within their terms of service that gives them the ability to just
[2474.74 --> 2476.74]  Pull that down be like look. No
[2476.74 --> 2483.68]  You actually can't do that you have you have four weeks to get all that crap off the server or set it public or something because that's that's no
[2483.68 --> 2485.68]  This is not what this is for
[2485.74 --> 2486.74]  Um
[2486.74 --> 2490.50]  So unless they have that in there. They're not going to be able to do that at the same time
[2490.74 --> 2495.74]  YouTube is very well known for enacting policy with AI and then just like heavy-handed
[2495.74 --> 2502.46]  Very large glove smacking and getting a lot of extra stuff that they didn't mean to get yes
[2502.70 --> 2505.30]  so I wouldn't be surprised if a bunch of
[2505.88 --> 2506.98]  firearm
[2506.98 --> 2508.98]  youtubers and and like
[2509.62 --> 2515.10]  Camping is we've talked about camping a couple times on here camping youtubers get caught up in this all the time
[2515.84 --> 2521.74]  Because the some of the gear that they have is not like super advertiser friendly because they might have knives and
[2521.74 --> 2528.92]  And knives just well you're screwed. Yeah, I still remember when I uploaded a video about the original razor blade
[2529.42 --> 2537.32]  Yeah with switchblade interface. Yeah, that monetization was turned off on that video because see you because razor in their infinite wisdom called
[2537.32 --> 2541.62]  They're like touch screen with a screen under it or touchpad with a screen under it
[2542.18 --> 2548.56]  Technically a touchscreen. I guess I called it the switchblade. I was like, oh great. That's fine. I didn't really need that money anyway. Cool
[2548.56 --> 2551.56]  Yeah, um and like
[2552.94 --> 2558.94]  Have you ever talked about your do you even still have it your been no, I don't talk about that. Oh, oh, yeah
[2559.88 --> 2565.80]  Okay, so I forgot a version of this line has by the way being in YouTube's terms of service since early 2018
[2565.80 --> 2573.00]  So the update just modifies the wording to sole discretion whereas before it said that YouTube must reason oh leave sorry to interject. Yeah a
[2573.96 --> 2574.96]  like
[2574.96 --> 2576.46]  camping knife
[2576.46 --> 2579.90]  YouTube channel thing they do a bunch of different other kind of stuff recognized
[2581.02 --> 2588.60]  You in one of their videos as they went through and they looked at different youtubers that have shown knives on screen and they like rated
[2589.42 --> 2595.74]  The the knife basically read they rated my knife and you were one of the like most positively
[2596.92 --> 2600.28]  Reviewed people on there. Why because I have my ladybug
[2600.28 --> 2607.78]  You had your ladybug and I think they showed one other one that you had like on your hip and they were like that is very good
[2607.78 --> 2611.56]  But the ladybug they were particularly impressed with what I were like that makes
[2612.16 --> 2614.70]  Specifically very good sense for what he's using it for
[2615.96 --> 2617.96]  And I was like that's pretty cool
[2617.96 --> 2621.86]  Well, I appreciate it heck yeah DBK is pretty cool
[2622.56 --> 2628.72]  Yeah, so before I lost like four of them to airport security because I'd always forget to take them off my keychain
[2628.72 --> 2629.04]  Yeah
[2629.04 --> 2633.00]  I had a what's the brand that makes the spy spider
[2633.00 --> 2635.98]  What what were they bench made? Are they spider co's?
[2635.98 --> 2636.54]  Yeah, spider co's
[2636.54 --> 2636.84]  Okay
[2636.84 --> 2642.56]  Yeah, I had a spider co ladybug that I would keep on my keychain and it was absolutely perfect for
[2643.20 --> 2646.42]  Unboxing things which is probably what I was doing with it when they
[2646.92 --> 2647.54]  Exactly yeah
[2647.54 --> 2651.44]  Oh, no, there's a smaller one. Maybe it's not the ladybug. Is that one all metal?
[2651.44 --> 2654.00]  Oh, maybe it is. No, that's that's the one. Yeah, ladybug
[2654.54 --> 2658.78]  Yeah, you know, it might have a girly name. I don't care. It doesn't like it was good for me
[2658.78 --> 2660.66]  I thought it was cool that they were like yeah
[2660.66 --> 2662.78]  I know that makes sense for what he's doing and I was like, huh
[2662.78 --> 2669.26]  We should totally do like an unboxing optimized knife that would be sick. Yeah, how would we sell a knife though?
[2669.74 --> 2672.82]  Shipping knives internationally seems like a can of worms
[2672.82 --> 2675.82]  Yeah, I know you can't ship them in the UK for sure
[2676.48 --> 2680.70]  Yeah, like for sure for sure. Yeah, I don't I don't want to get in trouble honestly
[2681.02 --> 2684.42]  Yeah, you might be able to talk to them and they would probably know
[2685.28 --> 2687.28]  Tell me something Nick. Yeah, um
[2688.32 --> 2690.82]  Okay, I know why you're here, but you got to tell me this
[2691.06 --> 2694.96]  Did you intentionally change the top image of the store to be the shirt?
[2694.96 --> 2698.22]  I'm wearing on the show right now. No. Okay, so that's just a happy accident
[2698.22 --> 2701.76]  I've been stocked a bunch of sizes for the GPU shirt. Okay, so the GPU shirt
[2701.76 --> 2705.72]  It's a very popular shirt. GPU shirt is back in stock ladies and gentlemen. I really like that shirt
[2705.72 --> 2708.12]  Could you imagine having the same shirt as your friends?
[2708.12 --> 2713.78]  You should totally get the Linus Tech Tips GPU shirt. Thanks, Nick. It's amazing. It slices. It dices. Thanks, Nick
[2713.78 --> 2715.88]  Your friend has one. Did you get one too?
[2715.88 --> 2721.40]  Did you have anything you wanted me to mention to the folks here? I mean, we're still technically running that promo from last week
[2721.40 --> 2723.94]  Oh, we didn't turn it off yet. Okay, cool
[2723.94 --> 2728.34]  So what was that buy underwear and get water bottle for ten bucks?
[2728.34 --> 2729.94]  990. Yes, sure
[2729.94 --> 2733.44]  Whatever, yeah, so buy a three pack of underwear get a water bottle for ten bucks
[2733.44 --> 2738.16]  LTT store.com. It's good stuff by the way. Thank you for changing the top top picture for the underwear
[2738.16 --> 2743.60]  Yeah, you were getting a little sheepish. It's slightly less slightly less eye aids for everyone
[2743.80 --> 2748.38]  To you know heading over to the store there. Next series of underwear Luke can be our money model. Oh boy
[2749.90 --> 2753.18]  All right, so anyway back to the YouTube terms of service change
[2753.18 --> 2758.06]  Um, basically this is a very small change. I totally get it and a YouTube spokesperson
[2758.06 --> 2763.10]  Oh, I hadn't actually read this quote yet said the company is not changing how we work with creators
[2763.30 --> 2768.20]  Nor their rights over their works or their right to monetize this has nothing to do with that
[2768.20 --> 2772.30]  No, this has to do with people abusing the service and I totally get it
[2773.08 --> 2776.40]  with that said I mean until we
[2776.40 --> 2778.40]  uh, until we
[2778.40 --> 2784.04]  Until we see how they actually utilize it. This is all just us guessing. Yes
[2785.52 --> 2786.52]  Yeah, oh
[2787.32 --> 2793.46]  That's funny if Linus did a spider-co knife I would totally buy it even if it was ladybug look it's not it's
[2794.08 --> 2798.68]  It's a very nice key. Yes. It's still manly to have a ladybug knife
[2798.68 --> 2802.56]  It's actually a very very nice keychain. Um, what else we go on and talk about today?
[2802.56 --> 2807.82]  Oh, we need to talk about private internet access. Okay. Yeah, so private internet access was acquired
[2808.28 --> 2810.44]  Actually, I'm gonna pull up my email
[2811.04 --> 2815.90]  One moment, please because that's where I actually am keeping most of the information about this
[2816.98 --> 2822.56]  We've got an email thread internally. So they were acquired by what is it Cape Technologies?
[2822.56 --> 2828.52]  Yeah, yeah, who I think is in the now, you know what no, I don't know if I can say that yeah, whatever it doesn't matter
[2828.68 --> 2834.32]  Point is Cape Technologies also owns two other VPNs Zenmate and CyberGhost SA
[2835.84 --> 2838.60]  The merged companies projecting whatever whatever
[2839.36 --> 2841.36]  Etc, etc, etc
[2842.08 --> 2844.08]  So here's the problem
[2845.42 --> 2848.38]  Cape Technologies has a bit of a history and
[2848.38 --> 2855.66]  And they actually have products that appear to have been bundled with
[2856.86 --> 2860.94]  I would call it adware at best with adware in the past
[2861.26 --> 2866.22]  So this puts us in a very uncomfortable position where we
[2866.76 --> 2875.18]  Have positioned PIA as a VPN that we trust because PIA had a long and proud history of
[2875.18 --> 2879.28]  Litigating when they were asked for their users records and
[2879.72 --> 2883.42]  Legitimately caring about their users privacy and their no log policy
[2884.94 --> 2890.42]  Unfortunately whenever the parent company of a company changes
[2890.42 --> 2892.42]  So whenever a company changes ownership
[2896.38 --> 2901.84]  Unless the acquiring company also has the same stellar track record
[2901.84 --> 2906.00]  It puts the users and the people who endorse it in
[2907.52 --> 2913.38]  An uncomfortable position where they have to decide whether they trust the
[2914.84 --> 2920.52]  The new parent company the same way that they do the company that they were used to working with
[2920.52 --> 2921.52]  Which is like a
[2922.72 --> 2924.72]  Nigh impossible thing
[2924.72 --> 2925.60]  Um
[2925.60 --> 2927.60]  You basically have to restart from zero
[2927.60 --> 2931.44]  So pretty much here's the situation
[2931.44 --> 2932.48]  Uh, we
[2932.48 --> 2934.48]  Have decided to give
[2934.48 --> 2939.20]  PIA and everyone we've worked with there has been great partners
[2939.20 --> 2943.92]  And I still i've used the service for years i'm still using it
[2943.92 --> 2948.16]  We have decided to give them an opportunity to explain themselves
[2948.16 --> 2950.32]  And to um
[2950.96 --> 2952.56]  Give us
[2952.56 --> 2955.92]  Something to go with here to prove that we should still trust them
[2955.92 --> 2958.32]  Uh, we have asked them to
[2959.28 --> 2960.72]  To um
[2961.76 --> 2962.72]  Either work sorry
[2963.36 --> 2968.88]  Oh never mind we have asked them to either work with us to talk to you guys directly
[2969.28 --> 2972.80]  Or to give us information that we can share with you guys that should
[2973.68 --> 2976.40]  Reassure you guys that we should trust them as well
[2976.96 --> 2982.64]  And until they are able to do such a thing we have suspended our pia sponsor reads
[2982.64 --> 2987.04]  So we're not turning the whole thing off we're not blowing it up
[2987.84 --> 2990.72]  But we are not going to be talking about pia
[2991.12 --> 2996.24]  Until we've had an opportunity to make sure that you guys are still comfortable with us working with them
[2996.80 --> 2999.36]  So what that will probably end up looking like
[2999.92 --> 3001.60]  is some kind of
[3002.16 --> 3002.96]  um
[3002.96 --> 3006.64]  interaction with our audience whether it's in the form of a live stream or a poll
[3007.36 --> 3009.04]  where you guys basically
[3010.16 --> 3011.36]  Go emperor on us
[3011.36 --> 3013.76]  Yeah, you go yes
[3014.40 --> 3017.04]  Or no and if you guys say yeah, let's do it
[3017.44 --> 3020.96]  Then we will continue to work with pia and if you guys say no, let's not do it
[3021.44 --> 3022.40]  Then we will
[3023.12 --> 3029.44]  Work with you guys on what vpns you guys are comfortable with us working with and then we'll negotiate deals with them
[3029.76 --> 3032.24]  And we'll figure out how to move forward with this
[3033.84 --> 3038.40]  So that's that's the status update. I wish I had something more definitive for you
[3038.40 --> 3043.04]  um, in the case of the mcafee acquisition of tunnel bear
[3043.52 --> 3045.84]  it was a little bit more cut and dried for us because
[3046.88 --> 3050.00]  We already knew what our trust level was with mcafee
[3050.48 --> 3053.12]  So it was just like okay. Well, this doesn't work. Let's move on
[3053.68 --> 3055.36]  Whereas this these guys
[3055.36 --> 3056.96]  um, um,
[3056.96 --> 3062.56]  Their story about how they don't do that anymore or whatever sounds like you know
[3063.76 --> 3065.20]  Basically, we just need a little bit more time
[3066.32 --> 3069.84]  So that's where we're at on that. Thanks guys. Hopefully that um
[3071.12 --> 3076.00]  Hopefully that kind of puts your minds at rest for now. We are aware of it. We are working on it
[3076.00 --> 3078.24]  We will get you guys a resolution to it. What's up?
[3078.24 --> 3080.80]  Just a correction. So the cape technologies company. Yeah
[3081.36 --> 3083.84]  the stuff they did with the insertion was
[3084.56 --> 3090.96]  Before I think 2016. Yeah before 2016. Yeah, so I just want to make sure we make that absolutely clear and they were under a different name at that time
[3091.12 --> 3093.84]  Yeah, they were under a different name. Um, ceo is new
[3094.40 --> 3095.20]  uh
[3095.20 --> 3100.96]  Or is different from when they were inserting adware into their installers and stuff like that
[3100.96 --> 3106.48]  So like I said, we haven't got enough information for us to definitively say no
[3106.48 --> 3108.56]  We absolutely cannot work with these guys
[3108.56 --> 3114.40]  But we also haven't seen enough to fully exonerate them from what they have done in the past. So that's where we're at
[3115.44 --> 3119.92]  Um, what else did we want to talk about? I mean is stadia even that interesting?
[3122.08 --> 3128.48]  Uh, I don't personally think so. Oh, Apple removed user reviews and ratings from their website. Did you see this?
[3129.36 --> 3130.08]  No
[3130.08 --> 3136.00]  Comment different ladies and gentlemen. So this was originally posted on the forum by William CLL
[3136.56 --> 3141.84]  Uh, conveniently I am not signed into the forum so I can go ahead and share my screen with you beautiful ladies and gentlemen
[3142.24 --> 3149.04]  Uh, so this was posted 22 hours ago. Check this out. So, uh, this is uh, this these are some negative reviews of the Apple pencil
[3149.52 --> 3151.76]  Really? Still no replacement tips?
[3152.40 --> 3154.80]  Yes, this is the best stylus ever made no doubt about it
[3154.88 --> 3159.60]  But having no ability to replace a seven cent piece of plastic at the end of the stylus is more than whatever something something
[3159.60 --> 3166.56]  We'll never know what it said because Apple has silently removed the link to their ratings and reviews page on their online store
[3167.12 --> 3171.04]  Um, other sites that sell Apple products by the way have not been affected by this decision
[3171.04 --> 3172.96]  So you can actually see from the Wayback Machine
[3172.96 --> 3177.92]  This is what November 16th looked like and this is what November 17th looked like
[3179.28 --> 3179.44]  Now
[3179.44 --> 3181.44]  This is ridiculous
[3182.08 --> 3184.08]  I mean that was one of the things
[3184.40 --> 3189.68]  That I actually quite respected about Apple was they allowed people to post negative reviews of their products
[3190.16 --> 3191.28]  right on their own website
[3191.84 --> 3193.28]  And here we are
[3193.28 --> 3197.76]  I guess if you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything at all and by the way if you do have something nice to say
[3197.76 --> 3199.76]  Why don't you just say nothing at all about that, too?
[3201.12 --> 3201.76]  Zip it
[3202.88 --> 3204.88]  That's not that's not right
[3205.68 --> 3207.68]  That's ridiculous. Yeah, I agree
[3207.68 --> 3211.20]  And if Apple's story about this was going to be well, you know
[3211.20 --> 3214.00]  We were doing maintenance and the link got lost or whatever the case may be
[3214.32 --> 3217.92]  Don't buy it because the pages have been removed from the us uk and
[3218.56 --> 3220.56]  Australian Apple stores
[3220.56 --> 3223.68]  So that would seem to suggest that unless
[3224.40 --> 3229.44]  Everyone made a mistake all at the same time totally definitely completely by accident
[3229.92 --> 3235.12]  Um to be fair there's a lot of companies that don't have ratings in their stores. Yeah, that's fair
[3235.44 --> 3239.28]  But to have it there and then remove it I think is pretty bad
[3239.44 --> 3243.92]  Well, it's we're back to the conversation about like look if you had never given this to us in the first place
[3243.92 --> 3245.04]  We wouldn't be complaining
[3245.04 --> 3245.28]  Yeah
[3245.28 --> 3250.32]  But when your motto as a company is don't be evil and then you remove it the implication is be evil
[3250.56 --> 3255.68]  And when you're and when your policy is to accept user feedback and you know
[3256.08 --> 3258.32]  Take it as well if we had made a better product
[3258.32 --> 3261.84]  Maybe we wouldn't have gotten this negative feedback and then you reverse it
[3262.56 --> 3267.84]  Then the implication is well, we don't give two hoots about user feedback and we would rather hide
[3268.48 --> 3271.52]  Helpful constructive criticism in order to make more sales
[3272.80 --> 3274.56]  That's what it looks like to me. Yeah
[3274.56 --> 3275.12]  Yeah
[3275.12 --> 3281.04]  You know, it's kind of interesting. Mm-hmm. I want to show you guys this just because I find it hilarious how useless it is
[3281.04 --> 3283.04]  I'm eating another piece of bacon. I'm sorry everyone
[3283.12 --> 3288.64]  Microsoft has been in pretty good graces with the community for a long time now
[3290.08 --> 3294.96]  When's the last time there was a strong microsoft controversy? There's a lot of like that
[3295.68 --> 3297.36]  Windows 10 sucked
[3297.36 --> 3303.12]  Yeah, it took like six months. Yeah, but like windows 10 patches have been terrible forever, but they deleted people's data
[3303.84 --> 3305.84]  Okay, it's pretty bad. Yeah
[3307.04 --> 3310.16]  Anyways show my screen ironically though people didn't seem as mad
[3311.44 --> 3316.16]  As you'd kind of expect yeah, like as you would be if apple like okay
[3316.88 --> 3321.92]  Sorry not apple microsoft like if intel pulled something like that if intel had a bug in their cpu and
[3321.92 --> 3326.32]  I even point zero zero one percent of users lost one file
[3328.72 --> 3329.76]  Whereas
[3329.76 --> 3335.92]  Microsoft like actually had a big problem and white all your stuff. Yeah, it seems like people mostly kind of forgave them
[3336.24 --> 3342.16]  This is my cynical. I absolutely detest windows 10 and it is inferior to windows 8.1
[3342.16 --> 3345.52]  And it crushes my soul that 7 and 10. We know how you feel.
[3345.52 --> 3347.52]  dx12 and not 8.1
[3348.32 --> 3355.20]  Ah, but I think it's in my in my brain. It's just because windows 10 sucks so bad that they're just kind of rolling with the punches at this point
[3355.60 --> 3359.04]  But okay, I find this hilarious. These are the reviews on
[3359.52 --> 3365.44]  Microsoft.com for windows. This is shopping window. I know when you scroll this far down. It looks like a website from
[3366.00 --> 3369.52]  2002 maybe but uh once you scroll up it looks a little bit better
[3369.84 --> 3370.96]  um
[3370.96 --> 3374.24]  But this this is the reviews windows 10 pro for workstation has none
[3374.24 --> 3378.40]  It's new it's just not it's not that new
[3380.16 --> 3382.16]  Windows 10 pro 37
[3383.76 --> 3385.76]  It's just like no one uses it
[3386.48 --> 3388.48]  yeah
[3389.44 --> 3390.32]  oh man
[3391.20 --> 3393.20]  I don't know
[3393.20 --> 3395.20]  persistent memory to access files fast
[3396.16 --> 3397.36]  let's be
[3397.36 --> 3398.80]  what is persistent memory
[3399.76 --> 3401.20]  on windows 10 workstation
[3401.20 --> 3405.04]  That sounds kind of cool. I want to look into that feature
[3407.12 --> 3410.24]  Persistent sorry guys we're learning on we're learning together on the show
[3411.28 --> 3411.92]  memory
[3413.12 --> 3415.04]  Their their video on uh
[3416.64 --> 3418.88]  Glass as a storage medium was actually pretty cool
[3418.88 --> 3422.64]  Hmm, okay, so uh
[3423.20 --> 3429.60]  Supports devices with persistent memory the fastest data storage possible and works persistent memory also keeps your files at hand if you shut down the system
[3429.76 --> 3431.76]  Oh, do they just mean like optane?
[3433.12 --> 3434.24]  Kind of seems like it
[3434.24 --> 3435.68]  Non-volta memory or nddim
[3436.00 --> 3440.24]  Yeah, okay, I think I think it's optane stuff. Okay, never mind. That's less interesting. How is that specific to
[3441.20 --> 3443.28]  Prover workstation? No, I think I think it matters
[3443.28 --> 3451.52]  Um, so it's like if you wanted to work on like a very very large simulation or something and you needed support for persistent memory for optane memory
[3452.00 --> 3459.04]  Um, that has to be specifically baked into the os is my understanding. Yeah, okay. All right. Well, is there anything else that you particularly wanted to cover?
[3459.36 --> 3461.20]  Uh, let me just make sure we got the
[3462.32 --> 3466.64]  Requirements we we spoke about a few things. Okay, so stadia is just kind of boring
[3466.80 --> 3469.20]  Are we gonna bring people on for that or no, I forget it?
[3469.20 --> 3474.72]  They're probably probably went home already. There's the I want to try it at least me too
[3475.52 --> 3477.36]  AMD's n3 details. Sorry, I might
[3478.96 --> 3483.28]  I'm still sick of my my throat's kind of had had it for today. I think yeah, there's some new details
[3484.64 --> 3486.64]  It's gonna be on seven nanometer plus
[3486.96 --> 3492.80]  We're expecting approximately 64 core 128 thread max processors. So pretty similar pin compatible
[3492.80 --> 3495.52]  um, pci express gen 4
[3496.16 --> 3501.60]  Basically, we're just unlike zen 2 which was evolutionary zen 3 is built from the ground up with
[3502.16 --> 3508.32]  Big performance gains. So this is the so amd is kind of adopted and oh wow i'm reading off my doc. Sorry about that
[3508.56 --> 3512.64]  Uh, so amd has kind of adopted intel's tick tock strategy. So die shrink
[3513.52 --> 3518.72]  But basically the same thing but like, you know a little bit higher clock speeds and some tweaks here and there
[3518.72 --> 3525.04]  And then re-architecture and then die shrink and then react we'll see how long they can keep it up because they're going to be relying on tsmc to
[3525.76 --> 3526.88]  keep
[3526.88 --> 3531.36]  Shrinking the no shrinking nodes and I had a that's gonna be real hard to do for the next little bit here
[3531.84 --> 3533.84]  um
[3534.88 --> 3541.04]  But uh, yeah, so we're expecting a pretty significant performance improvement according to what amd is talking about
[3541.04 --> 3545.36]  So if that happens intel is in for a world of hurt because
[3545.36 --> 3552.64]  There's there's not going to be a compelling reason to recommend an intel processor once this drops
[3553.20 --> 3555.20]  Um, all right. Let's move on to super chats
[3555.92 --> 3557.92]  What do we got for you ladies and gentlemen?
[3557.92 --> 3560.96]  Thanks ltht. Thanks trevor. Thanks christopher
[3562.08 --> 3567.36]  Thanks ben schmidt. I missed that broom. It had a lot of personality much like madison who should totally be hired
[3567.36 --> 3570.32]  Okay, if madison is qualified for a position
[3570.32 --> 3575.44]  We will interview her same as everyone else, but we're not just gonna give her a job because who's she's funny
[3575.68 --> 3579.68]  She was the co-host of one of our rog rig reboot videos this a weekend. Oh
[3580.24 --> 3582.24]  It is a very good video and
[3582.80 --> 3587.76]  She is a sassy lady. I will say that much. Uh, thanks angel. Thanks schizo jedi
[3589.20 --> 3592.00]  Uh, thanks jay different jay not that j
[3593.04 --> 3595.04]  Thanks william. Thanks joel
[3595.04 --> 3602.24]  Joel what hold on what what just happened? I don't know what just happened. Why is okay? This is amazing if you scroll down to the bottom
[3602.48 --> 3607.84]  There's more there, but the scroll bar goes outside of the box, and you can't see them. Yeah
[3608.48 --> 3610.72]  Okay, why is like what oh?
[3611.68 --> 3614.96]  Okay, thanks peter. Thanks the jog man
[3615.68 --> 3622.80]  Recently got your water bottle been great for work. It's great for all anywhere. You need water. It's perfect everywhere boots and shades
[3622.80 --> 3625.28]  YouTube gave me money to give away all right. Thanks dog
[3625.92 --> 3628.16]  Luke Abel says you guys should use wire cast
[3629.68 --> 3633.68]  Philip rose exceptional videos this week. Thanks hashtag hire Madison. Thank you for that Philip
[3634.72 --> 3636.72]  Thanks, Quinn. You know what?
[3636.72 --> 3640.72]  All the hire Madison. Okay, Ryan says first super shot ever. Thanks, Ryan
[3641.44 --> 3647.60]  Jijun to do moon PIA sold yes. Okay. We talked about that. No, we have not hired Madison yet bloody hell
[3648.32 --> 3649.36]  Fabio
[3649.36 --> 3655.04]  Best GPU for an i7 49 70k that it won't bottleneck. God just get a real good GPU. It's still a good cpu man
[3655.52 --> 3661.52]  Maybe overclock a little Irish. Oh, man fire Madison and hired the Colton guy wait what I've heard good things
[3661.52 --> 3663.52]  No, one's heard good things about Colton
[3663.52 --> 3665.52]  Lies lies Irish giant
[3666.24 --> 3669.92]  Midak says cyber truck looks like a pointy smart fridge, but I want one
[3670.80 --> 3672.80]  Alright sure I can get behind that
[3673.36 --> 3675.44]  Love the channel only channel I support via float plane
[3675.84 --> 3682.96]  I need you to make a whole tv channel like the whole g4 one that I can drill it. No, we don't need more tv. We're not going back to tv james
[3682.96 --> 3687.68]  Uh, jeremy. Hey, line it's been locked and luke watch it for a long time. You guys should set up a twitch channel
[3688.72 --> 3689.68]  That is just
[3690.24 --> 3692.80]  Linus media tv. I've heard people doing that
[3693.84 --> 3698.48]  Yeah, like on youtube too. You just set like a live stream channel. That's just like it just plays your voice. It just plays your videos forever
[3698.48 --> 3700.48]  Yeah, you guys should do it
[3700.48 --> 3704.32]  It's not even a stupid idea. It wouldn't be that hard
[3706.00 --> 3708.00]  Linus dot tv
[3710.40 --> 3714.08]  I like it. You could just have it on this stream on
[3714.96 --> 3716.96]  Twitch okay, make it sell
[3718.24 --> 3721.76]  Looks like no, I'm not gonna do it. Well, I'll just tell jake to do it. Right
[3723.04 --> 3725.04]  It's not my company
[3725.04 --> 3729.04]  I'm not in a hurry to do it, but it's probably a good idea. I don't I don't think it would be a bad idea
[3730.00 --> 3734.32]  Jeremy says watching you a long time. You helped me build my first pc sweet, Jeremy. Thanks, Andrew
[3734.56 --> 3738.00]  Thanks, Zachary Lowe. Oh my god, if you made a voting system where people could
[3738.64 --> 3742.48]  Like buy votes and you can vote on what video plays next. You're evil
[3744.48 --> 3749.12]  Remember ladies and gentlemen this idea is brought to you by the same genius mind as
[3750.08 --> 3752.08]  DLC on
[3753.20 --> 3755.20]  episodic books
[3755.92 --> 3758.88]  Where you have to buy every chapter and then dlc for the chapter

[3851.68 --> 3853.68]  That would be so complicated from the taxation standpoint
[3853.68 --> 3855.68]  That would be horrible

[3911.52 --> 3915.04]  Yeah, yeah, I know you'd never send me a super chat. No, uh, mitchell clark
[3915.36 --> 3920.64]  Also as someone who has tried to get a job at lmg you realize work permits are a thing you have to deal with right unless we don't
[3921.52 --> 3923.52]  If we hire canadians
[3923.52 --> 3925.28]  They're not a thing we have to deal with um
[3925.28 --> 3928.48]  The problem is not just the work permits because it is actually
[3928.48 --> 3935.12]  In fact your job to get a work permit before you apply somewhere because in order to legally work in a country
[3935.12 --> 3937.12]  You must have a work permit
[3937.12 --> 3938.00]  Um
[3938.00 --> 3943.12]  So we have gone through the process before we went through it with john we went through it with dennis
[3943.68 --> 3945.12]  And it is
[3945.12 --> 3949.12]  Extraordinarily complicated so depending on your qualifications. It might be super easy
[3949.12 --> 3953.68]  For john all he had to do was drive to the border. So hilarious. They wouldn't tell him ahead of time
[3953.68 --> 3960.08]  Drive to the border and then they just decided he was there in his car with all his possessions in the back and they decided because he had a law degree
[3960.64 --> 3967.44]  So it was like a different like skilled worker entry something something they gave him like a visa that he could work with
[3968.56 --> 3978.24]  For his wife at the time that was it was much more much more difficult dennis extremely difficult whole process took thousands of dollars months
[3978.72 --> 3979.44]  um
[3979.44 --> 3984.96]  So you know what the reality of it is for absolutely the perfectest person on the planet
[3985.52 --> 3991.12]  We have definitely made exceptions, but we already hired that person it's dennis so for the rest of you
[3991.12 --> 3993.60]  We're gonna have to stick with people who have a canadian wordpress
[3994.48 --> 3998.96]  Yeah, um game in life. Hopefully this helps you guys in these dark times. I don't know

[4007.76 --> 4015.36]  Basically all the muscles in my like the back of my right leg and my butt and my lower right back are just destroyed
[4016.24 --> 4018.24]  And I have to go on like
[4018.24 --> 4022.96]  Not even that long of walks and then measure my pain to see how well i'm doing while we work on it
[4023.52 --> 4026.24]  It's great. It's been kind of one thing after another for you, hasn't it?
[4026.40 --> 4030.24]  Yeah, but I think this is genuinely the source issue of all of the other
[4030.24 --> 4035.52]  We're finally there because i've heard that. I know i've heard that before. That's fair. I don't know dude. I know nothing about this stuff
