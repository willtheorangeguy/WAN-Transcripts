[0.00 → 5.24] Hey, there we go. It kind of took a second, but we're live now.
[5.24 → 5.88] We're live!
[5.88 → 7.48] Hooray! We made it.
[7.48 → 8.48] Huzzah!
[8.48 → 10.56] This show should be pretty good. We've got some interesting stuff.
[10.56 → 13.08] YouTube is disabling comments on all videos of children.
[13.08 → 14.92] This is not the same news as last week.
[14.92 → 15.42] No.
[15.42 → 16.34] This is different.
[16.34 → 16.92] It's different.
[16.92 → 17.68] Things are changing.
[17.68 → 18.52] Trust us.
[18.52 → 19.56] They're moving forward.
[19.56 → 23.12] We're going to go over some of the highlights from Mobile World Congress.
[23.12 → 26.88] You guys covered a bit of that last week as well, but there are so many phones.
[26.88 → 28.44] This is like last week version 2.
[28.44 → 28.94] Yeah.
[28.94 → 29.44] Yeah.
[29.44 → 34.62] Huawei CFO is going to be extradited to the US. There's more news about that. Again,
[34.62 → 36.12] I think we've talked about that before.
[36.12 → 38.76] We're just checking in. We're checking in on the Huawei thing.
[38.76 → 39.76] This is the update.
[39.76 → 40.76] This is the update.
[40.76 → 44.32] Also, USB 3.2 Gen 2x2.
[44.32 → 46.32] Self-explanatory.
[46.32 → 47.32] It's the worst.
[47.32 → 50.88] It's just the worst. We'll get more into that later.
[50.88 → 51.60] So dumb.
[51.60 → 52.60] Ah!
[52.60 → 53.60] Ah!
[53.60 → 57.80] And now you wait for the intro to go.
[57.80 → 58.80] Yeah.
[58.80 → 59.80] Third?
[59.80 → 60.80] This is my third time.
[60.80 → 61.80] Third win.
[61.80 → 62.80] I think?
[62.80 → 63.98] Have we done one before?
[63.98 → 65.98] No, you and I haven't.
[65.98 → 66.98] No, I haven't.
[66.98 → 67.98] I'm very excited.
[67.98 → 70.66] We should talk about the end.
[70.66 → 71.66] Yeah, I know.
[71.66 → 72.66] Thank you, Marines.
[72.66 → 73.66] Yeah, Marines.
[73.66 → 74.66] Love you so much.
[74.66 → 75.66] Thank you, Corsair.
[75.66 → 76.66] Corsair.
[76.66 → 77.66] You'll make a Corsair out of me.
[77.66 → 78.66] Want to stay private?
[78.66 → 79.66] Get a Pavilion.
[79.66 → 80.66] Pavilion.
[80.66 → 81.34] Private internet access.
[81.34 → 82.34] That's the one.
[82.34 → 83.34] And up there.
[83.34 → 84.34] And we're back.
[84.34 → 85.34] There we go.
[85.34 → 86.34] What do you think of Apex?
[86.34 → 87.34] I'm just going to skip all the news.
[87.34 → 88.34] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[88.34 → 89.34] Just go right to it.
[89.34 → 90.34] We're going to talk about games right away.
[90.34 → 91.34] So we are-
[91.34 → 92.34] Oh yeah.
[92.34 → 93.34] Should I bring that?
[93.34 → 94.34] Should I bring the thread up?
[94.34 → 95.34] Yeah, yeah.
[95.34 → 96.34] Let's do it.
[96.34 → 112.76] So we, in our free time, we one time, debated video games.
[112.76 → 113.34] And that was like the first-
[113.34 → 114.48] The extended interaction.
[114.48 → 116.70] The first extended interaction that we ever had.
[116.70 → 119.90] Because I was working here for like six months or something.
[119.90 → 121.04] I had basically never seen.
[121.04 → 123.12] Yeah, and we basically not talked at all.
[123.26 → 127.48] The float plane area of the office where myself and Jaden currently work,
[127.58 → 132.22] but Will will be working very soon, is like up tucked away in the corner.
[132.62 → 136.54] It's like one of the most non-normal places to go in the office.
[137.44 → 139.64] So we just like never run into each other.
[139.76 → 140.46] It's great.
[140.46 → 144.56] But we were talking about Destiny and looter shooters in general.
[145.24 → 145.32] Yeah.
[145.32 → 146.78] And like reward systems.
[147.38 → 149.04] How am I going to find this?
[149.14 → 149.56] I need to go back.
[149.56 → 150.62] I actually have no idea.
[150.80 → 151.86] But yeah, it was great.
[152.30 → 154.18] In the meantime, actually, I'm going to talk about something else
[154.18 → 156.70] just because I think it might actually take you a while to bring that up.
[156.78 → 157.04] Okay.
[157.30 → 159.34] So yeah, YouTube disabling comments.
[159.74 → 163.40] We talked about this last week when a bunch of channels had –
[163.40 → 164.50] some channels had been deleted.
[164.90 → 168.18] A bunch of channels had their monetization ripped and all their comments ripped.
[168.26 → 169.64] Some channels had videos taken down.
[169.64 → 170.16] Here we go.
[171.38 → 172.58] Let's do this one first.
[173.54 → 177.92] But now they seem to be just disabling comments on all videos of children.
[177.92 → 180.32] I'm kind of okay with that.
[180.58 → 180.88] Really?
[181.06 → 181.94] Yeah, it seems fine to me.
[181.94 → 191.46] I mean, I can understand it being like a kind of trade-off to have security for kids.
[191.60 → 193.78] You know, obviously there was this whole – did you mention this already?
[193.86 → 196.30] There was this whole like – I think you guys talked about it last week.
[196.30 → 198.12] The pedophile ring thing.
[198.26 → 203.82] Yeah, and how they were like leaving comments on videos that like link to actual like child pornography
[203.82 → 204.86] and it's a whole thing.
[205.04 → 209.98] So I can understand them doing this, but it is kind of crazy.
[210.54 → 215.84] Like if you upload a video that has a kid in it at all, no comments.
[216.46 → 216.98] At all.
[217.08 → 217.38] At all.
[217.66 → 218.40] That's pretty wild.
[218.40 → 220.40] So there are some –
[220.40 → 222.88] Stipulations?
[223.34 → 224.04] Exceptions, yeah.
[224.04 → 224.40] Exceptions?
[224.56 → 230.40] So like some young creators are being allowed to keep comments so that they can interact
[231.00 → 231.72] with their communities.
[231.96 → 232.30] Okay.
[232.50 → 233.76] But they have to –
[233.76 → 235.68] Yeah, like what defines a child?
[236.36 → 236.80] Minor.
[237.30 → 237.62] Okay.
[237.62 → 243.26] So like I think as long as you are under the age of majority in the U.S.?
[243.26 → 249.44] So wait, now like porn and having YouTube comments are like the same – you can be
[249.44 → 252.24] in that, and you can have comments on your YouTube video at the same age?
[252.26 → 255.58] I mean porn and YouTube comments are kind of similar levels of depravity, maybe.
[255.96 → 256.26] I don't know.
[257.14 → 262.82] Okay, so one of the reasons why I'm also okay with this is if you like to do some idiotic thing
[262.82 → 264.60] in a video when you're a small child.
[264.82 → 265.02] Right.
[265.02 → 267.78] And then you grow up to be old enough to like care about comments and read them and
[267.78 → 269.72] then you're like, oh, whatever.
[270.04 → 274.14] I think if you are being put in a video, I don't think you should have to be subjected
[274.14 → 277.02] to comment hatred or comment grossness.
[277.12 → 277.36] True.
[277.84 → 278.32] And –
[278.32 → 278.56] Yes.
[278.56 → 281.50] But like once you get to the point where you are hosting the video yourself, like you
[281.50 → 284.68] said, some child creators are being allowed to have comments on their videos.
[284.88 → 286.84] I think that's fine, probably.
[287.22 → 289.34] I also think YouTube's their own website.
[289.94 → 291.16] They can do whatever the heck they want.
[291.64 → 292.40] That's very true.
[292.40 → 295.34] By just not having the comments feature, it's whatever.
[295.58 → 295.72] Yeah.
[295.72 → 296.42] I don't think it's a big deal.
[296.66 → 300.30] YouTube comments are basically trash and useless anyway, so I just don't really care
[300.30 → 301.40] about having them turned off.
[301.60 → 303.70] Except the people commenting on this video.
[303.70 → 304.02] Yeah.
[304.54 → 305.82] Love you so much.
[305.82 → 311.82] Well, see, I'm a float plane representative, so I get to say that because I like those
[311.82 → 311.98] comments more.
[311.98 → 315.32] So you'll trash the YouTube comments, and it's like good cop, bad cop.
[315.46 → 316.86] I think in some –
[316.86 → 317.58] I'm the good cop.
[317.58 → 322.66] I think you need YouTube comments in general.
[322.80 → 325.32] I think YouTube comments are a good thing in a lot of situations.
[326.66 → 328.70] It just has the potential to be trash.
[329.02 → 333.86] And when you're taking a kid who's like probably not able to make the decision of being in the
[333.86 → 336.28] video or not, maybe just guard them from that.
[336.84 → 337.02] Yeah.
[337.02 → 337.94] I don't think that's a bad thing.
[337.94 → 343.60] Well, I think at the very least I understand this from a temporary perspective.
[343.90 → 344.08] Yeah.
[344.38 → 350.48] Because this whole news about the pedophile ring on YouTube just came out, well, like
[350.48 → 353.56] last week, but there's a whole national conversation about it.
[353.56 → 353.74] Yeah.
[354.02 → 357.66] So I can understand that this is like, okay, what do we do right now?
[357.72 → 359.92] We have to stop this right away.
[360.06 → 364.06] So let's just do this and then maybe down the line they come up with a more nuanced
[364.06 → 364.62] system.
[364.80 → 365.18] I don't know.
[365.32 → 366.80] I think it's a solid stopgap solution.
[366.80 → 371.04] I think maybe an end goal might be to have it so that this is the default.
[372.00 → 372.86] Oh, okay.
[373.38 → 374.82] But maybe it can be overridden.
[375.48 → 378.30] And if you're the channel creator, and you're like, yeah, I want comments.
[378.40 → 380.68] Maybe it gives you a little like, are you sure?
[381.00 → 381.48] Oh, okay.
[381.56 → 382.92] These are the types of things that could happen.
[383.24 → 384.96] Maybe these are the types of things to look for.
[385.08 → 388.04] We're going to auto moderate these things, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[388.14 → 389.50] But yeah, you can turn them on if you want.
[389.64 → 390.42] I can see that.
[390.46 → 391.24] That could be kind of cool.
[392.02 → 393.38] There's a big difference.
[393.58 → 396.52] I've been, just to bring up Flow plane again, I've been noticing this a lot with
[396.52 → 396.78] Flow plane.
[396.84 → 399.64] There's a big difference between like, we're going to have this feature and have it on
[399.64 → 400.14] for everybody.
[400.76 → 403.40] And we're going to have this feature available, but it'll start off.
[404.12 → 404.34] Right.
[404.44 → 406.28] And it's kind of a fun way to be able to play with things.
[406.58 → 408.00] We're like, you can do that if you want.
[408.06 → 410.92] We don't necessarily think it's a good idea, but we'll make it for you.
[411.04 → 411.42] And it's there.
[411.42 → 412.82] It's just, it's really sad.
[412.82 → 416.54] It's like sad to me that this is like necessary.
[416.80 → 418.76] Something or like even brought up at all.
[418.94 → 419.44] Yeah, I agree.
[419.92 → 420.20] Yeah.
[420.20 → 420.70] Completely agree.
[421.08 → 423.28] Like, this is why we can't have nice things.
[423.36 → 423.62] Yeah.
[423.82 → 424.34] That's the thing.
[426.22 → 430.82] So I did, I mean, I don't know if you want to get into like the other stuff where that
[430.82 → 434.60] was kind of part of, this is kind of part of like a national conversation that's going
[434.60 → 439.98] on right now about like children's privacy and like how much, because, you know, in the
[439.98 → 443.76] early days when like Facebook first came out and all these social media platforms, there
[443.76 → 447.90] was kind of, there was some age gating and like you had to be 14 to use the platform or
[447.90 → 448.14] something.
[448.24 → 448.42] Yeah.
[448.94 → 451.86] And that is kind of like really slid.
[452.16 → 452.52] Yes.
[453.74 → 456.42] I don't know what turn of phrase I was going to go there, but.
[456.66 → 460.70] I don't know, but I don't even remember exactly how they did it, but I remember kids when
[460.70 → 463.64] like Facebook first came out that were younger than me getting Facebook accounts and the
[463.64 → 465.96] whole like, oh, I had to lie about my age.
[465.98 → 466.50] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[466.50 → 468.28] And like, it's not really a thing anymore.
[468.34 → 468.56] Right.
[468.64 → 473.48] And not, not only, I mean, I don't interface with those people as much, but like I, you
[473.48 → 474.42] never hear about it.
[474.54 → 478.28] And it's on, yeah, it's like, it's like kind of hilarious when you go to a site, and it's
[478.28 → 480.82] like, you must be 18 to view this content or whatever.
[480.82 → 480.92] Yeah.
[480.92 → 482.30] It's like, it feels like an old website.
[482.44 → 482.68] Yeah.
[482.74 → 483.20] And it's like.
[483.94 → 484.96] That doesn't happen anymore.
[485.26 → 486.56] Like who is going to be like.
[487.22 → 488.08] Oh, jeez.
[488.16 → 489.86] I guess I'll go to Disney.com.
[490.16 → 490.60] You got me.
[490.72 → 490.98] Mom.
[491.70 → 492.72] I'm not allowed.
[492.72 → 494.90] Mom, can you come click the button?
[495.84 → 496.24] Yeah.
[496.68 → 498.46] That was my small child voice.
[498.70 → 499.20] There you go.
[499.34 → 499.56] Nice.
[499.60 → 500.22] It's me.
[501.54 → 501.92] Team me.
[504.28 → 508.00] But yeah, the reason I brought that up is because there are like, had been like some
[508.00 → 514.72] seemingly innocuous kids videos that like had, well, you know, did you see this with the
[514.72 → 515.28] filthy Frank?
[516.22 → 517.54] There was a kid's video.
[517.68 → 517.98] Okay.
[518.48 → 519.46] You know who filthy Frank is?
[519.46 → 519.70] Yeah.
[519.70 → 519.86] Yeah.
[519.92 → 525.48] He had like a little clip of himself in one of his videos giving.
[525.90 → 526.68] Oh, jeez.
[527.16 → 528.22] Instructions on how to.
[528.56 → 528.98] Oh.
[529.24 → 530.52] Harm yourself properly.
[530.78 → 533.64] And that was like spliced into a kid's video.
[534.80 → 539.60] So that's part of the national conversation right now is like a mom found this and kind
[539.60 → 540.56] of brought attention to this.
[540.62 → 541.90] And then they found some other videos that were doing.
[541.90 → 542.70] That was spliced into a kid's video?
[542.80 → 542.98] Yeah.
[543.76 → 544.12] Wow.
[544.12 → 548.80] Like, so there are people not only, not only like pedophiles, there are also people who
[548.80 → 550.68] are just looking to like hurt kids.
[551.04 → 551.40] Yeah.
[551.40 → 552.16] That's not good.
[552.34 → 555.00] I find filthy, filthy Frank downright hilarious.
[555.34 → 555.70] Yeah.
[555.82 → 556.62] No, he's a funny guy.
[556.92 → 557.24] Completely different.
[557.32 → 557.48] Yeah.
[557.54 → 559.54] He's like a successful artist now.
[559.62 → 559.88] Yeah.
[560.00 → 560.24] Music.
[560.44 → 560.80] He makes music.
[560.96 → 561.30] Dodge.
[561.56 → 561.72] Yeah.
[561.72 → 562.10] Heck yeah.
[562.26 → 565.24] But like, you know, that was a joke clip of him from a long time ago.
[565.50 → 565.76] And they.
[565.88 → 568.60] Taking it out of context and put it in a kid's video, which is not where it's supposed to be.
[568.60 → 572.80] So anyway, basically this moral of the story is kids stay off the internet.
[573.52 → 574.42] Go play outside.
[577.00 → 578.32] It's not safe anymore.
[579.04 → 580.70] Play, play your Nintendo switches.
[581.14 → 581.44] Yeah.
[581.78 → 584.66] Not only is it not safe anymore, it was never safe.
[585.00 → 585.60] No, not really.
[585.66 → 586.46] You've been living a lie.
[586.46 → 590.68] I was having a conversation with Linus on a previous WAN show about his kids getting
[590.68 → 592.08] phones and using the internet and stuff.
[592.56 → 598.40] And not only is it going to be probably pretty weird as they get older to like see dad on the
[598.40 → 598.68] internet.
[599.02 → 599.14] Right.
[599.14 → 601.52] Like they're friends that like computers and phones and stuff.
[601.74 → 602.02] Yeah.
[602.14 → 602.76] Are like watching.
[602.86 → 603.82] I think about that too.
[603.98 → 604.26] Yeah.
[604.54 → 605.32] Oh, yeah.
[605.44 → 606.46] Well, I mean, I don't have kids.
[606.52 → 607.02] No, but.
[608.04 → 608.66] If I do.
[608.74 → 609.00] Yeah.
[609.14 → 611.72] It's like they'll, like I have this whole catalogue.
[611.80 → 613.68] That catalogue of all the like.
[613.90 → 614.12] Yeah.
[614.22 → 614.38] Yeah.
[614.38 → 615.34] I'm going to be able to like, look.
[615.34 → 618.70] People are going to see my old, if you want to see the worst video I've ever done.
[619.06 → 621.90] My old Blackberry review video from 2013.
[622.70 → 624.64] I literally hadn't slept for two days.
[624.68 → 625.32] Pulling it up now.
[625.32 → 626.26] Because I was working.
[626.26 → 629.24] Like it's, yeah, even just get a, get a still frame from it.
[629.32 → 632.88] But I don't remember exactly what Blackberry it was, but it was on.
[632.88 → 633.64] Landis Tech Tips.
[633.86 → 634.78] Tech Tips.
[634.94 → 635.66] Luke Blackberry.
[635.84 → 637.42] Luke Blackberry.
[637.98 → 638.94] It might work.
[639.20 → 640.40] But this was just horrible.
[640.72 → 643.48] I legitimately hadn't slept for two days.
[643.64 → 646.32] And Landis was like, hey, you got to film that Blackberry video now.
[647.22 → 650.08] And I was like, can I, can I like have a shower first or something?
[650.10 → 651.56] He's like, no, we got to get it done now.
[651.56 → 655.14] And it just looks ridiculous.
[656.74 → 657.82] Ah, no, none of these.
[657.94 → 659.06] Here, let me try to find it.
[659.16 → 661.36] I found a NCI Tech Tips Blackberry review.
[661.52 → 661.94] Oh, jeez.
[661.96 → 662.88] We can check that one out.
[664.10 → 664.98] It's not that one.
[665.60 → 666.68] Did you know I worked on that channel?
[668.54 → 669.86] Yeah, yeah, in the very beginning.
[670.08 → 670.30] Yeah.
[670.68 → 670.78] Yeah.
[670.78 → 674.40] Well, you were Slick, the intern.
[674.56 → 675.14] Yes, yes.
[675.20 → 677.44] I just didn't know if you actually knew back then.
[677.64 → 680.82] And because you guys had nicknames, I was forced to choose a nickname.
[681.56 → 681.96] Okay.
[682.30 → 682.54] Okay.
[682.60 → 682.90] Myself.
[682.94 → 683.46] No offence.
[683.58 → 685.30] I didn't interface with that team very much.
[685.36 → 686.60] Your guys' nicknames were weird.
[689.70 → 690.96] Were they any weirder?
[691.44 → 692.68] Any weirder than yours?
[692.94 → 694.92] At least mine had like an origin and a reason.
[695.16 → 695.90] I had a reason.
[696.20 → 696.60] Keys?
[696.74 → 697.12] Yeah.
[697.42 → 698.38] I played piano.
[698.84 → 699.24] Okay.
[699.46 → 699.86] All right.
[699.86 → 703.96] Everyone was just like, do you just really like keychains?
[704.30 → 707.50] Like, I have so many keys, guys.
[707.70 → 710.68] Like door, house door, car, work.
[711.74 → 716.20] Weren't they all like at least able to be interpreted as being car related?
[717.72 → 718.64] Our nicknames?
[719.08 → 719.36] Yeah.
[719.92 → 721.88] So wasn't it like wheels and keys?
[722.28 → 725.50] Chris was wheels because he liked cars.
[725.92 → 726.40] Okay, yeah.
[726.40 → 728.08] And that was the only nicknames.
[728.08 → 729.32] Oh, and then I was keys.
[729.44 → 732.46] And then we had an editor and his nickname was Ace.
[732.78 → 733.68] N-C-I-X Ace.
[734.50 → 735.40] His name was Calvin.
[735.70 → 735.98] Okay.
[739.00 → 740.08] I don't remember all of them.
[741.24 → 741.58] Oh, is this it?
[741.58 → 742.58] Barrett didn't have a nickname.
[743.32 → 745.64] Jack didn't have a nickname because his name was just Jack.
[746.08 → 746.76] Oh, did you find it?
[746.76 → 747.98] I don't think this is it.
[748.22 → 748.86] Oh, man.
[749.56 → 749.82] How?
[749.98 → 750.68] Why are we talking about blackberry?
[750.68 → 751.34] I was wearing a red shirt.
[751.58 → 751.88] I don't know.
[751.92 → 754.48] We were talking about how there's like regrettable things that are still on the internet.
[754.58 → 754.96] Oh, okay.
[755.06 → 757.04] And this was a very regrettable thing.
[757.26 → 758.30] But I don't, I can't find it.
[758.30 → 759.02] And here it is.
[759.66 → 760.50] Oh, man.
[761.06 → 761.42] Exciting.
[761.42 → 766.26] Oh, very cool hair, dude.
[766.64 → 767.18] It's so bad.
[767.22 → 769.54] You guys can't see this because I can't screenshot from this laptop.
[770.00 → 770.54] Oh, send me the link.
[770.60 → 772.26] So it's part two, I switched.
[772.38 → 774.18] It only has 50,000 views, luckily.
[775.08 → 776.62] 50,000 views on the LTT channel.
[776.86 → 779.44] Part two, I switched to blackberry.
[779.44 → 785.56] So we used to do these eye switch things where we would use something for 30 days and then talk about it.
[785.56 → 787.86] Look at that hair! Look at that hair!
[789.72 → 792.60] Switch it over so they can see it.
[794.02 → 794.28] What?
[798.38 → 800.36] Okay, hold on. I'm going to have to run in front of the camera.
[800.62 → 802.06] Wait, wait, wait. Oh, why?
[802.36 → 803.88] Because I think the thing isn't sinking.
[805.74 → 808.86] Wait, what if I do this? Oh, I'm going to wait for you to do it.
[809.84 → 813.74] Hold, bear with us, boys and girls, and anyone in between.
[814.96 → 817.82] It didn't, here, look, I'm disconnecting.
[819.72 → 821.94] Connecting again. Where's Linus when you need him?
[822.06 → 824.62] Technical difficulties on the WAN show. Who would have thought?
[825.94 → 827.38] That's so weird. That's so annoying.
[828.00 → 828.64] That is pretty annoying.
[829.00 → 830.06] Anyway, if you want to look at it.
[830.06 → 831.86] And that was from a while ago because I, like, changed the view.
[831.88 → 832.80] That was, yeah, that was from a while ago.
[832.80 → 835.22] Dang it. Well, we can't show any of the sources then.
[835.22 → 842.76] If you want to see it in its hilarity, it's part two I switched to BlackBerry 10 blog 30-day challenge.
[843.48 → 844.16] Linus Tech Tips.
[844.16 → 848.68] With Linus Tech Tips in the title because we were perfect at stuff back then.
[848.94 → 850.40] Very, very good at stuff.
[850.66 → 857.24] But, yeah, like, it's just the internet is like, it's weird.
[857.24 → 858.16] Because back in the day.
[858.22 → 859.06] It's like the Badlands.
[859.30 → 861.22] It was a little bit more divided, I think.
[861.86 → 863.38] There were the bad sites.
[863.46 → 863.72] Right.
[863.90 → 865.24] And there were the clean sites.
[865.30 → 865.52] Yeah.
[865.94 → 867.66] And now it's just kind of like you never know.
[867.80 → 868.38] It's everywhere.
[868.52 → 871.26] When you're going to stumble upon a dick butt.
[873.56 → 874.62] Anyway, moving on.
[874.70 → 875.56] We're the worst offender.
[876.02 → 876.34] Yes.
[877.18 → 877.78] We do terrible.
[877.78 → 878.38] That's really annoying.
[878.52 → 879.78] So we can't show the laptop.
[879.78 → 881.22] Can't show screens, unfortunately.
[881.44 → 881.96] Don't know why.
[882.06 → 883.62] Hey, guys, you're going to have to take our word for it.
[883.84 → 885.12] We have no proof.
[885.12 → 887.12] Everything.
[887.80 → 889.18] We could literally say anything.
[890.46 → 893.28] Look, we got the articles before they got taken down.
[893.46 → 894.70] You look them up, and they're not there.
[894.82 → 896.30] That's, they were there.
[896.40 → 896.86] Trust us.
[897.18 → 897.54] Absolutely.
[898.08 → 899.10] Okay, but the Twitter.
[899.62 → 903.32] We can't even show the Twitter convo for the game thing.
[903.32 → 904.36] Oh, no, we can't.
[904.40 → 904.58] No.
[905.72 → 906.22] This is dumb.
[906.28 → 906.74] Where's Jake?
[907.06 → 910.70] All the people that could fix this setup are not here right now.
[910.70 → 912.04] Well, okay, I just don't.
[914.18 → 914.58] Anyway.
[915.12 → 916.02] There we go.
[916.14 → 916.34] Oh.
[916.90 → 917.80] I got mine working.
[918.00 → 918.54] Oh, okay.
[918.62 → 919.18] Okay, hold on.
[920.14 → 921.74] Let me see if I can get back.
[922.22 → 922.54] There.
[922.92 → 925.30] I really wanted mine working, but that's fine.
[925.52 → 927.00] You know, whatever.
[928.06 → 929.54] First, that's the phone.
[929.84 → 930.24] Jeez.
[930.44 → 931.90] I'm happy we've come this far.
[932.30 → 933.10] Blackberry what?
[933.62 → 933.94] What is it?
[933.94 → 934.02] 10.
[934.68 → 935.42] Oh, okay.
[935.56 → 937.74] Wait, was that the first Android one?
[937.80 → 939.04] No, it wasn't Android yet.
[939.34 → 939.58] No.
[939.86 → 941.38] They tried to do their own thing.
[941.38 → 941.78] Just.
[942.04 → 943.24] Very cool.
[943.48 → 943.66] Oh.
[944.48 → 945.30] Very cool.
[945.40 → 946.06] Oh, no.
[948.84 → 950.88] Pre-beard and just the worst hair.
[950.90 → 952.52] I don't even understand what's going on here.
[952.60 → 953.28] I've got two.
[953.68 → 955.88] Were you wearing a toque before this?
[956.28 → 956.62] I just.
[956.90 → 957.36] A beanie.
[957.46 → 958.72] That's a beanie for the Americans.
[959.22 → 959.48] Yeah.
[960.28 → 961.10] No, aren't they different?
[961.98 → 962.56] I don't think so.
[962.56 → 966.48] I thought a toque comes down and then comes back up and maybe has a ball.
[966.68 → 967.96] And I thought a beanie just came down.
[968.44 → 969.12] I don't think so.
[969.14 → 969.90] I have no idea.
[969.94 → 971.48] I mean, they might be different, but I'm pretty sure.
[971.48 → 971.60] I have no clue.
[971.60 → 976.54] Generally, a knitted cap is a toque in Canada.
[977.26 → 977.52] Yeah.
[978.24 → 979.28] That's probably correct.
[979.40 → 979.58] Okay.
[980.50 → 981.32] Twitter convo.
[981.82 → 982.56] How do I find this?
[982.60 → 982.72] Oh.
[983.88 → 984.96] Maybe I can get yours working too.
[984.96 → 986.22] Wait, are you in Hangouts right now?
[987.62 → 988.94] I could send it to you.
[988.94 → 992.30] Let me see if I can get this going.
[993.58 → 994.18] There we go.
[994.34 → 994.74] Oh, sweet.
[994.86 → 995.12] Okay.
[995.40 → 996.50] So I posted this.
[997.06 → 998.84] We're not talking about tech news right now.
[998.90 → 999.40] We're talking about.
[999.52 → 999.62] Yeah.
[999.82 → 1000.94] We're taking a break.
[1001.40 → 1005.72] I posted this on November 28th at 11.07 a.m.
[1005.72 → 1007.12] And it's like still going.
[1009.94 → 1014.98] So this is an article on Forbes talking about how the guy's really upset.
[1014.98 → 1021.44] He's so upset about how there are cosmetic items locked behind a paywall.
[1022.26 → 1026.36] And in Destiny, you can grind and get your stuff that you want.
[1026.42 → 1030.08] But then all of a sudden, oh, you got these really cool things that have, they have lore
[1030.08 → 1030.98] attached to them.
[1031.08 → 1031.24] Nope.
[1033.02 → 1035.56] I'm trying to let him get through the story without jumping.
[1035.70 → 1037.48] And you can't read the lore.
[1037.48 → 1043.76] You can't participate in this universe that you live in without paying money.
[1044.00 → 1047.16] And that, you know, that's just wrong and irresponsible.
[1047.50 → 1051.86] So anyway, I was like, why is this guy so upset about this?
[1052.00 → 1056.18] If you don't, you know, don't care so much about the cosmetics.
[1057.16 → 1059.30] So I was like, this is stuff that makes me go, why?
[1059.96 → 1063.80] The fact that people care about cosmetics so much that they write giant articles about
[1063.80 → 1064.52] how it upsets them.
[1064.52 → 1068.02] Look at this freaking guy.
[1068.38 → 1069.68] Comes out of the woodwork.
[1069.78 → 1070.92] He's got stuff to say.
[1073.68 → 1075.34] I have too many thoughts.
[1076.34 → 1077.00] That's right.
[1079.16 → 1079.56] Yeah.
[1080.48 → 1080.88] Anyway.
[1081.40 → 1083.98] So you don't need, we don't need to go through the whole thing.
[1084.16 → 1087.48] Basically, you're like, hey, there are reasons for people to get upset and it's valid.
[1087.54 → 1088.80] And I'm like, all right, fair enough.
[1089.14 → 1091.34] But also people shouldn't care so much.
[1091.74 → 1092.92] And you're like, yeah, fair enough.
[1092.92 → 1093.36] Yeah.
[1093.56 → 1095.10] And in the end, I was right.
[1097.92 → 1098.28] Okay.
[1098.34 → 1101.80] But what are your thoughts on, there's a big new splashy game.
[1101.98 → 1102.84] What are your thoughts on Apex?
[1103.30 → 1103.92] Have you played it?
[1105.08 → 1105.44] Okay.
[1105.54 → 1106.36] I will talk about Apex.
[1106.62 → 1108.06] There's some cosmetics in that game.
[1108.44 → 1108.68] Yeah.
[1109.02 → 1110.02] See, Apex is great.
[1110.14 → 1110.80] It's free to play.
[1110.80 → 1113.16] So if you want to buy cosmetics, you can.
[1115.00 → 1117.32] I haven't bought any cosmetics and I probably never will.
[1118.90 → 1122.44] Maybe I will eventually if I'm like, I'm playing this game a lot and I want to support the developers.
[1122.56 → 1124.10] But I haven't really played it that much.
[1124.44 → 1124.64] Yeah.
[1124.92 → 1127.92] I've like probably played under 20 matches.
[1128.18 → 1129.46] So this is what I was kind of hoping.
[1130.10 → 1130.36] What?
[1130.36 → 1131.66] Because we found a middle ground.
[1132.02 → 1132.22] What?
[1132.44 → 1133.70] I completely agree.
[1134.14 → 1135.24] It's a free game, so who cares?
[1135.72 → 1136.28] This is a trap.
[1137.34 → 1138.40] I got you now.
[1138.92 → 1139.30] No.
[1139.40 → 1139.52] Yeah.
[1139.58 → 1139.72] No.
[1139.80 → 1141.68] I think that's a pretty good solution.
[1141.82 → 1144.84] I liked how, I sort of liked how League of Legends did it.
[1144.90 → 1145.92] I thought that was pretty good.
[1146.62 → 1151.38] There was a little bit of gating there with champions because there were so many champions
[1151.38 → 1153.46] that as a new player coming in, it would be very hard to get them all.
[1154.20 → 1155.52] How does League of Legends do that?
[1155.56 → 1156.78] I've played like once.
[1156.96 → 1157.16] Okay.
[1157.22 → 1157.70] So League of Legends.
[1157.70 → 1158.82] You have to buy champions?
[1158.92 → 1161.00] You have like eight champions that are free that rotate every week.
[1161.06 → 1161.20] Right.
[1161.20 → 1163.04] So you can try them all, which is really cool.
[1163.22 → 1163.36] Okay.
[1163.36 → 1166.70] But then there's like an insane amount of champions that if you join the game now, it'd
[1166.70 → 1168.20] be very hard to earn all of them.
[1168.40 → 1168.60] Right.
[1168.62 → 1169.78] Very hard to earn all of them.
[1169.80 → 1170.06] Okay.
[1170.46 → 1171.52] I could probably do it.
[1173.20 → 1174.16] It's just a grind.
[1175.92 → 1176.64] All you need is time.
[1176.72 → 1177.84] I'll play 3,000 games.
[1177.92 → 1178.58] I don't even care.
[1178.62 → 1179.38] Of which I have none.
[1180.64 → 1183.34] But yeah, I like Apex's model.
[1183.60 → 1187.56] There are Legends, but there's only two that start locked, and they're actually pretty easy
[1187.56 → 1188.70] to earn the currency to unlock.
[1188.70 → 1189.64] And they're not even that good.
[1191.02 → 1193.32] The two that you have to unlock are not very good.
[1193.94 → 1195.54] Because I haven't unlocked them yet.
[1195.58 → 1196.08] I haven't played them.
[1196.14 → 1197.44] But from what I hear, they're like, nah.
[1197.74 → 1198.00] Yeah.
[1198.22 → 1198.44] Yeah.
[1198.48 → 1200.20] One of them has the biggest hatbox in the game.
[1200.20 → 1200.36] Yeah.
[1200.36 → 1201.38] Just be Wraith.
[1201.40 → 1202.00] Close to it.
[1202.30 → 1202.48] Yeah.
[1202.66 → 1203.66] Wraith is extremely strong.
[1203.74 → 1204.74] So yeah, you know what's going on.
[1204.82 → 1205.14] I know.
[1205.14 → 1205.94] I thought it was pretty good.
[1205.94 → 1206.62] So much about Apex.
[1207.12 → 1210.74] Makes me very happy because I love the developer behind that.
[1210.88 → 1211.20] Respawn.
[1211.54 → 1211.90] Respawn.
[1212.06 → 1212.22] Yep.
[1212.30 → 1215.00] Didn't I talk to you relatively recently about Titan fall 2 campaign?
[1215.60 → 1217.06] I love the Titan fall 2 campaign.
[1217.14 → 1217.66] It's amazing.
[1217.78 → 1217.94] Yeah.
[1218.00 → 1218.32] It's great.
[1218.46 → 1223.70] I mean, it didn't knock my socks off, but it's a solid, it's a good campaign.
[1223.82 → 1226.10] Oh, we were talking about this at the thing.
[1226.30 → 1226.52] Yeah.
[1227.52 → 1229.86] You thought it was the best FPS campaign.
[1229.86 → 1235.80] It's a hard thingy to define because like, do you include Fallout 4 as an FPS?
[1236.02 → 1242.06] But like the most like on rails multiplayer focused FPS campaign, which is a lot of caveats.
[1242.06 → 1243.72] The best like Call of Duty-issue.
[1243.72 → 1243.98] Yeah.
[1244.16 → 1247.16] Call of Duty, Battlefield, Titan fall, this kind of games.
[1247.26 → 1250.52] Of those, I think it's the best single player campaign in a very long time.
[1250.56 → 1250.68] Yeah.
[1250.72 → 1250.90] Good.
[1250.90 → 1254.10] And this is actually, Apex has been perfect for Titan fall 2.
[1254.22 → 1256.96] A lot of people are playing the multiplayer again.
[1257.92 → 1258.56] And so if you-
[1258.56 → 1262.36] Because people that don't want a Battle Royale, if you want similar gameplay, like there's
[1262.36 → 1264.28] guns and stuff that are taken from Titan fall 2.
[1264.28 → 1265.34] It's in the same universe.
[1265.92 → 1266.10] Yeah.
[1266.10 → 1266.26] So.
[1266.74 → 1267.68] But there are no Titans.
[1268.08 → 1268.62] Very sad.
[1268.84 → 1269.36] Very sad.
[1269.42 → 1270.06] And no wall running.
[1270.58 → 1270.90] Anyway.
[1271.26 → 1273.82] So, I don't know.
[1273.92 → 1274.66] Is this the game?
[1274.76 → 1277.26] Is this the game analysis, a new show or?
[1277.70 → 1278.28] I mean, sometimes.
[1278.62 → 1278.86] Okay.
[1279.20 → 1279.34] Yeah.
[1279.34 → 1280.40] You can just keep talking about games?
[1280.40 → 1280.70] Yeah.
[1280.90 → 1282.80] Um, but no, let's get back to-
[1282.80 → 1284.42] We didn't even get into this.
[1284.82 → 1285.06] Sure.
[1285.14 → 1285.46] Let's go.
[1285.68 → 1286.08] Wow.
[1286.30 → 1287.54] I didn't even know James jumped in.
[1287.54 → 1287.62] Should we?
[1288.00 → 1288.64] Are people mad?
[1288.68 → 1289.70] What are people saying in the chat?
[1289.70 → 1290.60] I can't see the chat.
[1291.06 → 1291.58] Who knows?
[1292.48 → 1293.36] It's over there, right?
[1293.42 → 1293.88] It's also here.
[1293.88 → 1294.68] Oh, I can bring it up.
[1294.78 → 1295.26] Or there.
[1295.42 → 1295.86] Or here.
[1296.86 → 1297.18] Oh.
[1299.60 → 1300.32] Ash is best.
[1300.44 → 1301.20] That's Overwatch.
[1301.48 → 1303.18] We're not even talking about Overwatch.
[1303.52 → 1303.94] League of Legends.
[1304.82 → 1305.78] Oh, is Ash in League of Legends?
[1307.26 → 1308.02] And Overwatch.
[1308.14 → 1308.76] Good call, though.
[1309.22 → 1309.62] Yeah.
[1309.86 → 1310.32] Both of them.
[1310.32 → 1310.86] Okay, look.
[1310.92 → 1313.70] All I'm saying about Destiny-type games, looter shooters.
[1313.88 → 1314.08] Yeah.
[1314.34 → 1314.70] Anthem.
[1315.70 → 1316.60] I haven't played Anthem.
[1316.62 → 1317.08] See, that's the problem.
[1317.12 → 1317.92] I haven't played Anthem either.
[1318.14 → 1318.34] Okay.
[1318.64 → 1321.84] Anyway, Division 2, Division Original, whatever you want to do.
[1321.84 → 1322.04] Okay?
[1322.12 → 1327.92] The problem that I think is the problem with looter shooters is that they are designed, and
[1327.92 → 1328.66] you agree with this.
[1328.66 → 1328.68] And you agree with this.
[1329.30 → 1330.18] Or you did, anyway.
[1331.64 → 1332.54] Correct me if I'm wrong.
[1333.44 → 1337.20] They're designed to capitalize on our worst instincts.
[1337.24 → 1337.42] Yeah.
[1337.60 → 1339.04] To be like, ooh, shiny thing.
[1339.12 → 1339.64] I want that.
[1339.76 → 1339.86] I have to get it.
[1339.86 → 1340.68] I have to get that.
[1340.68 → 1343.46] I'm not going to have fun if I don't grab that shiny thing right there.
[1343.46 → 1343.86] Yeah.
[1344.06 → 1344.58] And...
[1344.58 → 1349.12] Because it makes the game about how your character looks in a lot of different ways.
[1349.52 → 1356.86] And I think that the more that games move towards this kind of, like, gambling-issue experiences
[1356.86 → 1362.38] where you're only doing it to, like, watch numbers go up, or to, like, collect all the
[1362.38 → 1365.86] things, it's like, then I feel like that's...
[1365.86 → 1366.74] And if...
[1366.74 → 1370.38] You can make the counter-argument that, oh, I enjoy that.
[1370.60 → 1370.88] That's...
[1370.88 → 1373.16] And the point of playing games is to enjoy them.
[1373.66 → 1375.36] So, fair enough.
[1375.68 → 1376.26] If that is your thing.
[1376.46 → 1376.90] But, I don't know.
[1377.02 → 1377.32] I just...
[1377.32 → 1378.18] I think that that's maybe not the healthiest.
[1378.18 → 1379.36] See, but that was...
[1379.36 → 1380.00] That's the root.
[1380.44 → 1380.72] This is...
[1380.72 → 1381.82] See, we're getting into this again.
[1381.94 → 1386.58] That's the root of my whole argument here, is that's why I care about cosmetics behind
[1386.58 → 1387.34] paywalls.
[1389.00 → 1394.10] It's because I don't want them there in a game that you have to pay for, because it
[1394.10 → 1395.38] makes the game about that.
[1399.06 → 1400.74] Because they're going to go, oh, we can make...
[1400.74 → 1402.70] Look at FIFA Ultimate Team.
[1402.80 → 1404.56] They make bazillions of dollars.
[1404.86 → 1406.16] We need to do that more.
[1406.16 → 1408.72] So, we need to drive the player to this thing.
[1409.18 → 1411.68] And Destiny does a lot of driving the player to their store.
[1412.26 → 1413.24] And I hate that.
[1413.62 → 1413.94] So...
[1413.94 → 1416.16] I hate that cosmetics are behind a paywall, because it affects...
[1416.58 → 1417.26] Gameplay.
[1417.48 → 1419.34] Not because of the cosmetics that are behind the paywall.
[1419.38 → 1422.02] And particularly, these cosmetics?
[1423.10 → 1425.06] I don't really play Destiny anymore.
[1425.28 → 1427.16] So, like, but then how do you feel about Apex?
[1427.30 → 1428.36] Because that...
[1428.36 → 1429.36] That is a...
[1429.36 → 1430.40] The entire monetary...
[1430.40 → 1433.08] I give that a little bit of a pass, because...
[1433.08 → 1433.82] Because it's free to play?
[1433.88 → 1434.58] It's free to play.
[1434.84 → 1438.18] It's harder to make that argument, because it's free to play.
[1438.30 → 1439.96] Also, they don't really push you to the store.
[1440.54 → 1440.86] Right.
[1441.78 → 1444.38] It's, like, less in your face, I would argue.
[1444.38 → 1444.78] Yeah.
[1445.48 → 1445.78] Okay.
[1445.96 → 1447.08] So, I agree with that.
[1447.42 → 1449.54] I can understand the...
[1449.54 → 1452.60] If you're paying full price for a game, and then they want you to buy expansions, and
[1452.60 → 1455.22] then they're like, the coolest stuff behind a paywall, it's just like, whoa!
[1455.64 → 1456.14] No, I agree.
[1456.28 → 1457.68] See, I agree that it's horrible.
[1457.86 → 1460.32] I agree that the tactics being used are stupid.
[1460.56 → 1460.74] Yeah.
[1460.74 → 1463.04] And not constructive to the industry.
[1463.28 → 1463.50] Yeah.
[1463.92 → 1464.32] 100%.
[1464.32 → 1469.40] But I think what I'm saying is that, okay, we have this situation that we are faced with.
[1470.90 → 1472.34] Cosmetics are locked behind a paywall.
[1472.68 → 1473.82] So, what do we do about this?
[1474.14 → 1480.24] Do we, you know, either buy everything and then be sad about it?
[1480.36 → 1483.38] Or we tweet the developers being like, oh, I'm so upset?
[1483.64 → 1486.36] Or do we just not buy it and don't say anything?
[1486.42 → 1487.36] See, I just quit the game.
[1487.78 → 1488.04] Yeah.
[1488.14 → 1488.36] Yeah.
[1488.36 → 1489.50] But that's what I'm saying.
[1489.62 → 1489.82] Yeah.
[1490.08 → 1490.78] Just quit the game.
[1490.86 → 1493.00] Don't, like, write an article on Forbes about it.
[1495.34 → 1496.66] Just stop playing.
[1497.50 → 1498.64] I guess my only article...
[1498.64 → 1502.88] It's weird that it's on Forbes, but Forbes has become a very weird website over the last
[1502.88 → 1503.70] few years.
[1503.70 → 1505.66] I don't really know what Forbes is anymore.
[1505.88 → 1509.38] Half of the reason I'm even saying Forbes is that it's, like, crazy to me that it's
[1509.38 → 1509.92] on Forbes.
[1509.92 → 1510.04] How is it on Forbes?
[1510.12 → 1510.84] Yeah, I know exactly.
[1510.96 → 1514.38] Forbes has turned into, like, I thought it was just, like, a business magazine.
[1514.58 → 1518.00] And now it's, like, clickbaity tech articles.
[1518.36 → 1518.40] Yeah.
[1518.62 → 1519.22] Very strange.
[1519.52 → 1520.56] Really, really odd.
[1520.72 → 1521.90] There's a...
[1521.90 → 1522.08] Yeah.
[1522.16 → 1523.68] So I'm going to actually go with what James said.
[1523.90 → 1525.12] Forbes belongs on Medium.
[1525.32 → 1525.46] Yeah.
[1525.52 → 1527.40] If this was a post on Medium, sure.
[1527.62 → 1527.78] Yeah.
[1527.78 → 1532.18] Because maybe you want to perpetuate the idea of, like, hey, guys, let's stop playing that
[1532.18 → 1532.48] game.
[1533.04 → 1533.66] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1533.66 → 1534.52] Let's play something else.
[1534.52 → 1538.44] It's weird that it's on Forbes, but I'm not necessarily against the...
[1538.44 → 1541.18] To be honest, I couldn't make it through the whole article because I was so bored.
[1541.26 → 1541.94] Oh, yeah, yeah.
[1542.62 → 1543.18] But...
[1543.18 → 1546.20] Well, clearly, I read the whole thing, and then I was like...
[1546.20 → 1547.78] But my...
[1547.78 → 1549.68] Increase...
[1549.68 → 1551.56] Incredulity.
[1552.94 → 1554.48] I don't think I've ever said that word.
[1554.56 → 1555.24] I've read it a bunch.
[1555.24 → 1555.62] I know.
[1555.72 → 1558.80] But that's my problem is that I read things and I want to say them and I don't know how
[1558.80 → 1559.32] to pronounce them.
[1559.64 → 1565.10] I said Gener instead of Genre for much of my life.
[1566.60 → 1568.84] That would have taken me a while to figure out, too.
[1569.06 → 1569.98] But that makes sense.
[1570.08 → 1570.62] I can see it.
[1570.70 → 1570.82] Yeah.
[1572.16 → 1572.52] Okay.
[1572.66 → 1574.40] So, look, let's wrap this up.
[1574.54 → 1577.40] We agree that cosmetics behind paywalls are stupid.
[1577.58 → 1577.78] Yeah.
[1578.34 → 1578.86] But...
[1578.86 → 1583.82] But sometimes in the case of Apex, I can kind of understand because they have to fund their
[1583.82 → 1584.52] game somehow.
[1584.58 → 1585.08] Yeah, yeah, totally.
[1585.08 → 1585.56] And it's free.
[1585.64 → 1586.90] And we both agree Apex is great.
[1586.90 → 1591.30] I wish it was a paid game because then that reduces the amount of hackers and reduces
[1591.30 → 1593.12] the amount of annoying, terrible people.
[1593.40 → 1593.68] Right.
[1593.82 → 1595.24] But that's fine.
[1595.76 → 1596.02] Yeah.
[1596.46 → 1598.26] That's a completely different conversation.
[1598.58 → 1601.64] And I'm just saying, the world sucks.
[1602.36 → 1603.10] Deal with it.
[1604.62 → 1606.76] And you're saying, let's make the world a better place.
[1606.78 → 1608.38] And I'm like, you're naive.
[1608.80 → 1610.12] That sounds like a lot of work.
[1611.44 → 1613.02] Why don't you just not?
[1613.02 → 1613.54] Yeah.
[1614.86 → 1615.34] Okay.
[1615.66 → 1616.50] Let's move on.
[1616.50 → 1616.98] I like it.
[1617.08 → 1617.82] Back to topics.
[1618.18 → 1621.88] Hey, we can talk about some things real quick.
[1621.96 → 1622.36] Hey, you know what?
[1622.40 → 1624.22] Let's do like a lightning round of MWC.
[1624.52 → 1624.76] Okay.
[1624.96 → 1625.26] Okay?
[1625.44 → 1625.76] Sweet.
[1625.98 → 1626.52] Real quick.
[1626.66 → 1627.22] I like it.
[1627.46 → 1629.48] Are we allowed to show like videos like this?
[1630.00 → 1630.96] Are we going to get taken down?
[1631.20 → 1632.34] Oh, you can't even see anymore.
[1632.40 → 1633.12] It broke again.
[1633.68 → 1634.08] No.
[1634.56 → 1634.90] We're good.
[1635.04 → 1635.78] Oh, it's just slow.
[1636.04 → 1637.22] Well, I just didn't...
[1637.22 → 1637.92] I'm slow.
[1638.16 → 1639.42] What if I make it like small?
[1639.42 → 1642.06] I don't think that's going to happen.
[1642.06 → 1642.86] What if...
[1642.86 → 1643.74] If it's like...
[1643.74 → 1644.72] This is an ad, right?
[1644.84 → 1646.06] This is an ad from Huawei?
[1646.34 → 1647.66] I can't zoom out.
[1649.36 → 1649.76] No, it's...
[1649.76 → 1650.10] Well, yeah.
[1650.16 → 1650.86] It's their like...
[1650.86 → 1652.36] I don't think making it small is going to happen.
[1652.36 → 1652.60] Boom.
[1653.16 → 1654.08] Just like that.
[1654.38 → 1656.38] You think we're going to get in trouble if I play this right now?
[1656.38 → 1658.72] Is it an ad from Huawei?
[1659.14 → 1659.32] Yeah.
[1659.32 → 1660.58] If it's an ad, they're not going to care.
[1660.76 → 1661.28] And they might...
[1661.28 → 1661.64] They might auto thingy.
[1661.64 → 1663.20] Yeah, it's like their launch video.
[1663.26 → 1664.22] But we'll be able to fight it.
[1664.24 → 1664.66] It's no problem.
[1664.86 → 1665.06] Yeah.
[1665.24 → 1666.70] Well, we do that on Tech Linked all the time.
[1666.82 → 1667.00] Yeah.
[1667.24 → 1668.02] Huawei loves us.
[1672.66 → 1673.48] Okay, anyway...
[1673.48 → 1674.18] Why is it small?
[1674.32 → 1675.00] I don't understand.
[1675.70 → 1677.00] Because we're going to get in trouble.
[1677.00 → 1678.94] It's still going to get detected if it's small.
[1679.10 → 1680.24] What if I keep moving it?
[1681.56 → 1683.54] What if I keep making it bigger and smaller?
[1683.72 → 1684.98] I wonder if that actually would help.
[1685.68 → 1685.92] Okay.
[1685.92 → 1686.42] Oh, yeah.
[1686.42 → 1686.86] Oh, oh.
[1687.24 → 1690.76] Look, it's eclipsed by our video.
[1691.10 → 1692.90] That solves the problem right there.
[1692.92 → 1693.84] We didn't even see it.
[1695.40 → 1696.10] Okay, so look.
[1696.14 → 1697.02] There's the phone, okay?
[1697.54 → 1698.24] Look at that.
[1699.58 → 1699.90] Now...
[1699.90 → 1700.30] Pretty nice.
[1700.36 → 1701.42] You've seen the Galaxy Fold?
[1701.70 → 1701.92] Yeah.
[1702.04 → 1702.62] Which one's better?
[1702.98 → 1704.38] I like the Galaxy Fold more.
[1704.82 → 1705.22] Really?
[1705.94 → 1709.04] I haven't seen this one a lot, but that extend thingy is a little weird.
[1709.68 → 1712.92] Well, I disagree with you on virtually everything.
[1712.92 → 1714.26] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1714.90 → 1715.86] Makes it more fun.
[1715.92 → 1716.26] Why?
[1716.46 → 1717.24] Why do you like this one more?
[1717.44 → 1718.10] I haven't seen it.
[1718.14 → 1718.96] This is the first time I've ever seen it.
[1718.96 → 1720.94] Okay, so it folds flat.
[1721.04 → 1721.48] See this?
[1722.90 → 1727.88] It folds flat against itself, so there's not the crease on the inside.
[1727.98 → 1728.68] It's not the fold.
[1728.98 → 1729.10] Yeah.
[1729.10 → 1737.70] And this grip thing is nice because it lets the whole phone remain somewhat slim while...
[1737.70 → 1739.04] Is it slimmer while it's folded?
[1739.56 → 1740.34] Yeah, then the Galaxy Fold.
[1740.34 → 1740.70] Oh, okay.
[1740.80 → 1741.16] That's pretty cool.
[1741.16 → 1741.60] I have a diagram.
[1741.60 → 1742.48] I didn't have it, but...
[1742.48 → 1742.98] That's pretty cool.
[1742.98 → 1745.96] It shows that while folded, this is slimmer than the Galaxy Fold.
[1746.30 → 1747.64] Isn't this one notably more expensive?
[1748.06 → 1748.44] Yes.
[1748.60 → 1749.24] By like a lot?
[1749.24 → 1750.54] $2,600 US.
[1751.00 → 1751.80] How much was the other one?
[1752.54 → 1753.52] Only $2,000.
[1754.20 → 1754.60] $2,000.
[1754.60 → 1754.72] $2,000.
[1754.72 → 1754.82] $2,000.
[1754.82 → 1754.86] $2,000.
[1754.86 → 1754.96] $2,000.
[1754.96 → 1755.88] That's a pretty big difference.
[1756.06 → 1756.28] Yep.
[1756.72 → 1757.92] That's like a whole phone.
[1758.02 → 1762.60] But you and I and most of you watching aren't going to buy it anyway, so what's the difference?
[1762.78 → 1765.22] If money is literally no object, I like that it's slimmer.
[1765.42 → 1766.88] I kind of like that it folds into itself.
[1767.34 → 1768.60] I could see going for it.
[1770.24 → 1772.12] Huawei, there's some...
[1772.12 → 1773.58] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1773.70 → 1775.38] Like, again, I wouldn't buy either one.
[1775.38 → 1775.88] Yeah, yeah.
[1776.12 → 1780.74] I saw an interesting take the other day that was saying that the Galaxy Fold is actually
[1780.74 → 1783.80] better because it protects the screen when it folds, because the screen's on the inside.
[1783.80 → 1785.80] But...
[1785.80 → 1787.12] Sure.
[1787.80 → 1788.32] Do we have to do sponsors?
[1788.32 → 1789.50] I think if you're dropping that much...
[1789.50 → 1790.00] Yeah, eventually.
[1791.08 → 1791.44] Sometime.
[1791.76 → 1794.92] I think if you're dropping that much money on a phone, maybe it doesn't matter that much
[1794.92 → 1796.88] if you screw up the screen, because you can probably just buy another one.
[1797.50 → 1802.12] If you're spending, like, a car on a phone, you're probably just like, ah, whatever!
[1802.90 → 1803.82] I'll buy a four!
[1803.96 → 1808.64] Unless you're the one guy who's like, oh, man, if I just get this phone, my life is going
[1808.64 → 1809.22] to turn around.
[1809.42 → 1810.74] Is that hard luck?
[1811.74 → 1813.24] He's like, I just need to buy this phone.
[1813.24 → 1814.42] Unless I can fold my phone.
[1814.50 → 1816.58] And then I'll be able to multitask with three apps at once.
[1817.20 → 1820.88] I'll be able to do all the work I have been putting off, and then it breaks.
[1822.08 → 1822.72] And then their life's over.
[1822.72 → 1823.66] Whole world ruined.
[1823.84 → 1823.98] Yeah.
[1824.96 → 1825.98] Goes to the drink.
[1826.82 → 1829.34] Decides to just drink all his problems away.
[1829.48 → 1830.54] Okay, we're lightning round.
[1831.02 → 1832.02] Keep keeping it moving.
[1832.36 → 1833.08] HoloLens 2.
[1833.18 → 1833.80] Have you seen this?
[1834.08 → 1836.32] That video looks terrible right now.
[1836.48 → 1837.44] Is that really low res?
[1837.88 → 1838.58] I have seen this.
[1838.76 → 1839.44] I'm very excited.
[1839.50 → 1840.48] This was the native res.
[1840.48 → 1841.48] I'm very, very excited.
[1842.44 → 1843.14] It looks better now.
[1843.16 → 1844.80] Look how she's just doing stuff with her hands.
[1844.90 → 1845.92] Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[1845.94 → 1846.06] It's cool.
[1846.28 → 1846.76] It's very cool.
[1846.94 → 1848.44] I like that it has built-in hand detection.
[1849.40 → 1850.74] That's not that crazy, though.
[1850.96 → 1851.54] No, it's not.
[1853.04 → 1854.94] Leap Motion has sort of existed for a while.
[1855.08 → 1859.38] But does Leap Motion have eye tracking and voice commands?
[1860.30 → 1861.70] Voice commands are not that hard.
[1861.92 → 1863.12] Just put a microphone.
[1863.20 → 1863.94] Wow, good job, Microsoft.
[1863.94 → 1865.16] It is very cool, though.
[1865.32 → 1866.02] I am very excited.
[1866.66 → 1868.52] I've heard that the display on the inside is bigger.
[1868.66 → 1870.20] That was a huge problem with the last one.
[1870.36 → 1873.26] It's bigger, but look at this.
[1873.32 → 1873.70] But what?
[1874.64 → 1875.10] Oh, no.
[1875.18 → 1876.32] Look, I worked hard gathering all these stories.
[1876.32 → 1877.42] They lied about the FOV?
[1878.18 → 1882.80] So this is what they showed on the live stream.
[1883.06 → 1885.98] They're like, it's this big, but it's actually this big.
[1886.02 → 1886.58] The yellow box.
[1886.58 → 1887.22] The yellow box.
[1887.36 → 1888.82] The red is the original HoloLens.
[1889.54 → 1889.94] Okay, yeah.
[1890.02 → 1893.06] So the original HoloLens, it was sort of a problem.
[1893.38 → 1893.66] Right.
[1893.82 → 1894.92] It was tiny.
[1895.06 → 1899.24] I have tried it once, and I was like, yeah, this is dumb.
[1899.62 → 1901.72] Because it's cool, but it's dumb.
[1901.90 → 1905.36] It's just one of those things where you're like, okay, this isn't what we need.
[1905.70 → 1908.64] We need version 4 or 5 or something.
[1908.98 → 1909.98] We don't need this one.
[1910.48 → 1913.92] And this version 2 seems not there again.
[1914.10 → 1918.46] But I'm very excited because it's clearly a big improvement.
[1918.46 → 1919.92] And they just need to keep going.
[1920.34 → 1920.56] Indeed.
[1920.92 → 1921.12] Yeah.
[1921.20 → 1922.06] I think it's super cool.
[1922.34 → 1923.68] I don't think it's fully consumer ready.
[1923.90 → 1925.52] But neither do they, to be completely fair.
[1925.72 → 1927.20] They're not marketing this towards consumers.
[1927.36 → 1927.58] No.
[1927.80 → 1929.92] They're marketing this towards, like, factories or something?
[1930.44 → 1930.96] Businesses, yeah.
[1930.96 → 1931.52] Businesses, yeah.
[1931.52 → 1932.60] Just like various corporations.
[1932.86 → 1939.54] Although they do have a deal with Epic Games, where Unreal Engine will support HoloLens.
[1940.26 → 1941.04] Ever heard of that?
[1941.18 → 1941.82] Ever heard of...
[1941.82 → 1942.66] Unreal Engine?
[1942.74 → 1943.64] Ever heard of Epic Games?
[1944.36 → 1945.66] Ever seen this guy before?
[1945.84 → 1946.38] No, no.
[1946.38 → 1948.16] He looks real excited.
[1948.46 → 1949.16] Yeah, very.
[1949.18 → 1952.00] Look at that guy.
[1953.34 → 1954.24] Tim Sweeney.
[1954.42 → 1955.92] I know who Tim Sweeney is.
[1955.96 → 1956.70] I follow him on Twitter.
[1957.42 → 1958.82] I'm here to tell you about this.
[1962.44 → 1964.14] Okay, no, real quick, we'll do this.
[1964.26 → 1965.62] And then we'll, I guess we have to...
[1965.62 → 1965.74] One more?
[1965.92 → 1966.46] We do one more?
[1967.16 → 1967.38] Boom.
[1967.38 → 1968.34] Dual screen.
[1968.34 → 1968.36] Dual screen.
[1968.44 → 1970.20] So now this is LG's V50.
[1970.42 → 1973.30] It's not a folding phone, but it does fold, and it's a phone.
[1974.74 → 1976.52] So technically it is a folding phone.
[1976.64 → 1983.10] But the actual phone itself is this, and this, or maybe I'm getting that the opposite.
[1983.48 → 1986.50] One of these is the phone, and one of them is just a dual screen attachment.
[1987.14 → 1990.30] You can make your phone have two screens like a Nintendo DS.
[1990.30 → 1992.42] I was going to say, that looks like separate things.
[1993.34 → 1996.96] It looks like someone took like a steel plate on the back and just epoxied both ends of
[1996.96 → 1998.18] it and was like, two phones!
[1998.44 → 1999.14] Boom, that's a thing.
[1999.20 → 1999.56] We're done!
[2000.12 → 2000.34] Yeah.
[2001.00 → 2004.68] Well, that's what they're doing, because they didn't want to do the actual folding display.
[2004.92 → 2007.82] That seems sensible in a cost perspective.
[2007.90 → 2008.92] How much does this one cost?
[2009.32 → 2010.86] Well, not, probably not $2,000.
[2011.34 → 2011.60] Yeah.
[2011.78 → 2016.44] This is the V50, and then LG has another flagship, the G8, that is like basically just a regular
[2016.44 → 2016.78] phone.
[2016.88 → 2017.92] It's got a hand ID, though.
[2017.98 → 2019.18] You can unlock it with your hand.
[2019.18 → 2021.78] It's very exciting.
[2022.24 → 2023.78] Okay, and the last one.
[2025.64 → 2027.36] The last one is this Energizer.
[2028.04 → 2028.36] It's called the-
[2028.36 → 2029.10] So cool!
[2029.74 → 2031.22] I love this phone!
[2031.32 → 2034.12] Called the Power max P18K Pop.
[2035.58 → 2036.02] Pop!
[2036.22 → 2039.76] I love how so many people have been saying for so long, like, I'll take a thicker phone if
[2039.76 → 2043.90] I just get more battery, and Energizer's like, how thick!
[2044.12 → 2045.38] We have heard your requests.
[2045.70 → 2045.86] Yeah.
[2046.50 → 2047.90] Do you want six phones?
[2047.98 → 2048.26] Yeah.
[2048.26 → 2049.36] Stacked on each other?
[2049.48 → 2050.54] So that's friggin' enormous.
[2053.14 → 2053.66] Very cool.
[2053.66 → 2057.42] Did you see, um, didn't Ryan Reynolds comment on this or something?
[2058.06 → 2060.82] What, how you're like on your phone in bed, and you drop it and just crush it in your face?
[2061.18 → 2062.40] No, I didn't see that, but that's fair.
[2062.40 → 2064.14] I saw a screenshot of the tweet.
[2064.20 → 2066.60] I don't know if it was a real tweet or not, but hilarious.
[2066.60 → 2067.60] Yeah.
[2067.60 → 2069.10] It looks, and like, what are with those cases?
[2069.94 → 2070.28] Really?
[2070.28 → 2071.32] I don't think those are cases.
[2071.32 → 2072.40] I think those are just, that's just the phone.
[2072.40 → 2074.88] No, but like the body of the phone, I guess I'd call it.
[2075.00 → 2075.16] Yeah.
[2075.16 → 2076.74] Like, this looks straight out of the 90s.
[2076.86 → 2078.84] Energizer has not gotten over the bunny thing.
[2079.06 → 2079.36] Yeah.
[2079.36 → 2083.62] Well, I didn't even know that they make phones and then suddenly they come out of the woodwork.
[2083.62 → 2085.10] Well, I think this is the first one, right?
[2085.38 → 2085.70] Yeah.
[2086.28 → 2087.88] Making phones these days, I don't think it's all that.
[2087.88 → 2088.04] Well, no.
[2088.32 → 2090.28] They, this is one of like 18 phones.
[2090.78 → 2092.42] They announced like 18 phones.
[2092.58 → 2092.94] What?
[2092.94 → 2094.12] And this is only one of them.
[2094.62 → 2094.98] What?
[2095.26 → 2096.72] Some of them have pop-up cameras.
[2097.58 → 2097.94] Yeah.
[2098.00 → 2098.66] It's a whole thing.
[2099.18 → 2100.06] Oh, no.
[2100.36 → 2101.42] Energizer, what are you doing?
[2101.96 → 2102.40] All right.
[2103.52 → 2106.76] I've been, I've been steering this ship, and we're going all over the place.
[2106.78 → 2107.12] I hear you.
[2107.48 → 2109.08] But before we, before we do.
[2109.08 → 2109.20] What about that boy?
[2109.28 → 2109.76] What about that?
[2109.84 → 2110.60] Those boys right there.
[2111.26 → 2113.04] Let's, let's do that in one moment.
[2113.08 → 2113.34] Okay.
[2113.46 → 2113.70] You do.
[2113.70 → 2115.36] One very, I want to do one quick thing on this.
[2115.44 → 2115.74] Yes.
[2115.88 → 2118.80] You've got the brick, 18,000 million of hours.
[2119.14 → 2121.94] You've got the phone with the floppy extra screen.
[2122.16 → 2122.48] Yep.
[2122.48 → 2123.52] That looks like two phones.
[2123.82 → 2124.14] Mm-hmm.
[2124.26 → 2125.86] You've got the Huawei one.
[2126.34 → 2126.62] Yep.
[2126.66 → 2127.72] And you've got the Samsung one.
[2128.34 → 2128.70] Okay.
[2128.82 → 2131.46] Taking estimated price into account.
[2132.34 → 2133.66] You have to buy one.
[2134.00 → 2134.26] This is.
[2134.34 → 2134.78] I have to?
[2134.86 → 2135.36] You have to.
[2135.54 → 2136.30] Which one do you buy?
[2137.02 → 2137.76] Estimated price.
[2137.92 → 2139.90] Well, can I look up what the Energizer one is?
[2140.02 → 2140.26] Sure.
[2141.60 → 2144.84] But like, I don't think we have an answer for, for the.
[2145.16 → 2145.18] Oh.
[2146.44 → 2147.12] 680 bucks.
[2147.28 → 2148.12] You're just going to do that one?
[2150.74 → 2151.64] I don't know.
[2151.64 → 2152.50] Spend the least amount.
[2152.60 → 2155.98] You said this one or the dual screen V50 or the Huawei or the Samsung?
[2156.18 → 2156.38] Yes.
[2156.58 → 2157.20] Was there another one?
[2157.36 → 2157.46] No.
[2157.46 → 2157.56] No.
[2160.56 → 2164.72] Would you spend more to have not a brick that is a floppy phone?
[2165.06 → 2170.28] And then if you go to the floppy phones, do you buy the cheap one that's just an extra screen that'll die way faster?
[2170.28 → 2172.70] Well, I got to say, I'm not.
[2173.00 → 2176.60] So I got a Pixel and I don't have that many problems with battery life.
[2176.68 → 2181.98] I like charge it for, you know, 20, 30 minutes during the day and then that's good until the next day.
[2182.32 → 2182.54] Yeah.
[2183.02 → 2183.60] Did we freeze?
[2185.52 → 2186.26] Oh, okay.
[2186.38 → 2187.34] We did freeze though.
[2187.34 → 2192.30] But, so the battery one probably, you know what?
[2192.34 → 2193.72] I'd probably do the LG V50.
[2194.10 → 2194.66] Dual screen.
[2194.90 → 2195.18] Okay.
[2195.68 → 2202.54] Because the Fold and the Samsung one and the Huawei one scare me because the screens are probably going to get wasted.
[2202.66 → 2207.10] My whole thing is I buy a phone, I put like a big old case on it, and then I have it for like three years.
[2207.26 → 2207.44] Yeah.
[2207.58 → 2209.42] And nothing happens to it because I'm very careful.
[2210.56 → 2211.28] Okay, cool.
[2211.28 → 2212.24] All right, sponsor spots.
[2212.26 → 2212.86] Wait, what about you?
[2214.14 → 2215.56] We don't have time for this.
[2218.28 → 2219.56] Honestly, I'd probably do the same thing.
[2220.60 → 2226.38] If the Energizer phone was thinner but was still a little bit thicker than most phones and had bigger battery, I'd be interested in that.
[2226.48 → 2227.94] But it's like actually a brick.
[2228.08 → 2228.18] Yeah.
[2228.18 → 2229.24] The thing's actually ridiculous.
[2229.30 → 2232.44] I don't care having like a thick phone, but that is...
[2232.44 → 2233.36] It's just a little too much, guys.
[2233.36 → 2234.46] It's a bridge too far.
[2234.56 → 2235.70] You went too hard.
[2235.82 → 2235.96] Yeah.
[2236.42 → 2238.96] And the other two really high-end flip phones are just too expensive.
[2239.32 → 2239.52] Yeah.
[2239.74 → 2240.38] So I'll probably get the other one.
[2240.38 → 2240.56] Stupid.
[2240.56 → 2241.12] Okay.
[2241.72 → 2242.24] Marinas.
[2243.58 → 2244.06] Marinas.
[2244.24 → 2244.46] Hey.
[2244.52 → 2245.26] We've got the Linus roast.
[2245.40 → 2245.84] Give me...
[2245.84 → 2247.58] Let me pop open one of those bad boys.
[2247.58 → 2247.96] Which one do you want?
[2248.46 → 2249.04] You have to pick one.
[2249.08 → 2251.22] We got dark roast.
[2252.58 → 2253.86] Vanilla cappuccino.
[2254.34 → 2255.00] You know what?
[2255.26 → 2255.54] I would...
[2255.54 → 2256.74] You sound like you're into vanilla cappuccino.
[2256.74 → 2258.42] I would go vanilla cappuccino.
[2258.42 → 2258.56] Oh.
[2258.56 → 2261.38] But then I'm concerned what people think about me and...
[2261.38 → 2262.62] Oh, so you have to be manly.
[2262.72 → 2263.36] My gruffness.
[2263.44 → 2264.78] Yeah, so I'm going with dark roast.
[2265.04 → 2265.58] Very nice.
[2265.72 → 2268.28] Also, my brother drinks black coffee only.
[2268.56 → 2269.06] Oh, wow.
[2269.06 → 2271.66] And I put cream and sugar in mine.
[2272.74 → 2274.08] And he makes me feel small.
[2275.24 → 2276.88] So I'm having a dark roast.
[2276.98 → 2277.22] Cheers.
[2277.34 → 2277.76] Marinas.
[2277.84 → 2278.56] Love you so much.
[2278.68 → 2279.16] There we go.
[2279.44 → 2280.66] Marinas is probably in the chat.
[2280.80 → 2281.50] Say hi to them.
[2282.50 → 2284.42] Marinas coffee is coffee for fuel.
[2284.42 → 2288.88] Organic cold brew coffee in convenient 16 ounce cans with a flavour for everyone.
[2289.10 → 2294.44] Marinas coffee offers sweet and creamy flavours like mocha or caramel or bold flavours like their
[2294.44 → 2296.64] cold brew black.
[2296.86 → 2299.90] We at LDT have a permanent item on their store.
[2300.22 → 2301.24] The Lamb roast.
[2301.36 → 2302.08] That's this one.
[2302.08 → 2302.90] Heck yeah.
[2303.00 → 2308.90] The Lamb roast is a specially crafted custom blend of coffee designed by Marinas coffee
[2308.90 → 2309.78] and Linus tech tips.
[2310.26 → 2313.36] It's got chocolatey flavours, caramel finish.
[2313.78 → 2314.36] It's great.
[2314.50 → 2316.86] And I made that a couple of times in the office with our French press.
[2317.10 → 2317.28] Yeah?
[2318.14 → 2319.46] Oh, very nice.
[2319.56 → 2320.22] Very nice.
[2320.22 → 2322.30] Head over to madrinascoffee.com slash Linus.
[2322.58 → 2326.02] Receive 40% off your entire order with offer code Linus.
[2326.14 → 2326.50] Holy.
[2326.50 → 2327.02] Oh my.
[2327.18 → 2327.82] Kroikydinkles.
[2328.38 → 2329.14] Kroikydinkles.
[2329.30 → 2329.66] Crazy.
[2330.00 → 2330.28] Okay.
[2330.64 → 2331.04] Solomon.
[2331.22 → 2331.82] That's what that means.
[2333.28 → 2336.88] Solomon from Marinas coffee is in the chat.
[2337.12 → 2337.84] What's up, Solomon?
[2338.80 → 2339.84] Also, Corsair.
[2340.06 → 2341.80] The Corsair 1i 140.
[2345.50 → 2346.58] It's not actually heavy.
[2346.66 → 2347.68] That was just a dad noise.
[2347.94 → 2348.50] Don't worry about that.
[2348.68 → 2349.66] Have you done this one before?
[2349.66 → 2350.26] No.
[2350.76 → 2351.22] Oh, okay.
[2351.58 → 2361.04] Corsair 1i 140i and Pro 180 workstations are designed with creators and power users in
[2361.04 → 2361.26] mind.
[2361.36 → 2365.94] 12 litres in size and like that's actually a much more followable metric with this because
[2365.94 → 2367.34] it looks like, you know?
[2367.60 → 2368.00] Yeah.
[2368.30 → 2370.48] I mean, like it looks manageable, you know?
[2370.56 → 2370.74] Yeah.
[2370.94 → 2372.00] You could take this on the road.
[2372.46 → 2372.90] Easily.
[2373.20 → 2374.22] Take it to class.
[2374.28 → 2375.28] You could put that in your carry-on.
[2375.30 → 2375.90] Take some notes.
[2375.98 → 2376.22] Yeah.
[2376.92 → 2377.32] Yeah.
[2377.82 → 2379.04] If you want it.
[2379.04 → 2386.26] The i140, which is the one we have here, has an RTX 2080 in it, an i7-9700K, 32 gigs of
[2386.26 → 2390.42] RAM, 480 gigabytes of M.2 NVMe SSD, and a 2 terabyte hard drive.
[2390.42 → 2392.78] I just got a lot more scared of dropping it than I was before.
[2392.96 → 2393.22] Yeah.
[2393.42 → 2394.56] I was like one-handing it.
[2394.56 → 2397.06] Like, wow, this is actually a pretty sweet machine.
[2397.30 → 2399.16] Don't do this with your PCs, guys.
[2399.98 → 2402.20] This is why I didn't review the RTX 2080.
[2402.20 → 2403.20] Oh.
[2403.82 → 2404.06] Oh.
[2404.90 → 2405.60] You know that, right?
[2405.60 → 2405.86] Yeah.
[2405.98 → 2406.16] Okay.
[2406.28 → 2406.52] Yeah.
[2407.74 → 2409.02] Check the note through the link below.
[2409.42 → 2409.80] All right.
[2409.80 → 2411.90] Because this is what I do with...
[2411.90 → 2413.42] Just kidding.
[2413.52 → 2414.68] I would never do that to Corsair.
[2414.82 → 2415.38] Love you guys.
[2415.48 → 2418.36] Imagine you tried to do that skit, but dropped it.
[2418.54 → 2418.80] Yeah.
[2419.70 → 2421.06] That'd be really classic LCT.
[2421.06 → 2422.00] That's like my whole life.
[2423.00 → 2426.22] Doing something, and then right after being like, what if that didn't work?
[2427.52 → 2429.28] But I could have died.
[2429.28 → 2429.42] All right.
[2430.06 → 2431.30] Thank you very much, PIA.
[2432.14 → 2432.50] Pia.
[2432.80 → 2433.16] Pia.
[2433.76 → 2434.44] Pia, Pippin.
[2434.84 → 2436.12] One of my favourite things about...
[2436.12 → 2438.16] That sounded like Fjallraven, but like Pia.
[2438.16 → 2438.96] Pia, Pippin.
[2440.28 → 2441.76] Thank you, Pia, Pippin.
[2442.54 → 2445.76] One of my favourite things about the PIA sponsored spots is we can kind of say or do whatever.
[2445.76 → 2448.76] You can connect five devices at the same time, which you're totally not...
[2449.36 → 2451.44] No, you keep going.
[2452.20 → 2456.16] Which you're totally not supposed to hand to your family and friends and stuff, obviously.
[2456.16 → 2461.94] Apps include DNS leak protection and IPv6 leak protection, which is great.
[2462.30 → 2463.38] There's an internet kill switch.
[2463.46 → 2467.44] This part's very important so that it will block all traffic if the VPN becomes...
[2467.44 → 2468.04] What's that?
[2468.40 → 2468.64] Whoa.
[2472.86 → 2474.38] I've got a rearview over here.
[2474.56 → 2475.56] You said we could do anything.
[2477.96 → 2482.34] Check it out at leg.GG slash Pagan.
[2482.92 → 2483.94] They've been good to us.
[2484.18 → 2484.90] I have them on my phone.
[2484.90 → 2486.34] I didn't click the lower thingies.
[2486.64 → 2487.20] Oh, no.
[2487.34 → 2488.22] Here's the PIA one.
[2488.52 → 2489.46] And here's Corsairs.
[2489.70 → 2493.34] Sorry, they didn't get theirs like the whole time, but very, very nice.
[2493.44 → 2493.74] Very nice.
[2493.80 → 2497.62] Check out Corsair One, i140, i160, and Pro i180.
[2498.16 → 2498.84] Compact PCs.
[2498.94 → 2499.38] You saw them.
[2499.60 → 2501.24] They're just like little tiny things.
[2501.30 → 2501.90] You can put them wherever.
[2502.12 → 2503.22] You can play games on them.
[2503.52 → 2504.70] You can edit things.
[2504.70 → 2505.02] Yep.
[2505.42 → 2505.90] Spreadsheets.
[2506.12 → 2506.52] Develop.
[2507.28 → 2508.16] Anything you want.
[2508.36 → 2509.04] Paint.net.
[2511.04 → 2514.38] We had a conversation about that because we still make the WAN show thumbnails in Paint.net.
[2514.38 → 2514.62] Yeah.
[2515.14 → 2515.50] Awesome.
[2515.64 → 2516.20] Not Photoshop.
[2516.20 → 2519.58] You could definitely do that on that computer.
[2519.82 → 2521.24] Back to new stuff, though.
[2521.44 → 2522.06] Very cool.
[2524.46 → 2525.52] Do we do chats?
[2525.66 → 2526.54] Are we supposed to do the chats?
[2526.56 → 2527.12] We do chats.
[2527.20 → 2530.24] I want to do one thing first, though.
[2530.48 → 2531.54] LTX Expo.
[2532.42 → 2532.74] Oh.
[2532.74 → 2533.72] Has there been an update?
[2534.72 → 2536.10] Are we allowed to talk about numbers?
[2536.10 → 2537.54] We're still not allowed to talk about numbers?
[2537.54 → 2538.76] I don't think so.
[2538.82 → 2539.76] I haven't been told.
[2541.14 → 2542.32] And Colton isn't here.
[2542.56 → 2544.16] There has not been an update.
[2545.46 → 2545.90] Wow.
[2546.06 → 2546.68] I'm upset.
[2547.16 → 2549.14] I'm very agitated.
[2549.66 → 2550.06] Ah.
[2551.02 → 2553.18] Either way, LTX 2019, it's going to be amazing.
[2553.30 → 2557.34] All the BOC, as far as I know, is already sold, but they might be trickling out some more.
[2557.56 → 2557.88] Oh, yeah?
[2557.88 → 2559.56] I know they're doing that with the normal tickets.
[2559.68 → 2560.92] I don't know if they're doing that with BOC.
[2561.18 → 2562.14] I wouldn't count on it.
[2562.78 → 2566.44] But if you want to go to LTX, I would highly suggest purchasing your ticket now.
[2566.70 → 2568.22] They're selling ridiculously fast.
[2568.68 → 2570.06] Like, actually ridiculously fast.
[2570.32 → 2571.90] Jon is messaging me.
[2572.02 → 2572.90] No numbers.
[2573.24 → 2573.64] No numbers.
[2573.64 → 2574.46] Don't talk about numbers.
[2574.56 → 2576.08] So we can't say how many.
[2576.58 → 2577.58] I don't even know why.
[2577.64 → 2578.82] I don't know why that's important.
[2579.00 → 2581.30] But either way, we've sold a ton.
[2581.98 → 2585.66] So if you want one, you should probably get it now because there's legitimately not a ton left.
[2585.74 → 2586.02] Yeah.
[2586.66 → 2588.14] It's pretty nuts.
[2588.34 → 2589.20] It's really cool.
[2589.92 → 2590.68] I'm excited.
[2590.68 → 2592.70] I'm excited to, well, I don't know.
[2592.76 → 2598.14] Last year, I was at the same booth the whole time, and it looks like there's going to be a lot of different things to do.
[2598.56 → 2602.08] So I'm, yeah, and the whole team's going to be there.
[2602.16 → 2604.86] I was supposed to run the VR booth, and it was just impossible.
[2605.16 → 2605.40] Yeah.
[2605.96 → 2606.32] Yeah.
[2606.48 → 2608.34] Because I had to help with so many other things.
[2608.58 → 2608.98] Right.
[2609.26 → 2614.98] So that, like, the float plane customer support guy, Joe, was up visiting and wanted to go to LTX.
[2614.98 → 2615.70] So it went to LTX.
[2615.72 → 2618.54] And then we just incorporated him to help me with the VR booth.
[2618.54 → 2622.52] And then he basically soloed the VR booth the entire time when it was supposed to be three people.
[2622.66 → 2623.46] Oh, my gosh.
[2623.46 → 2624.48] Good job, Joe.
[2625.80 → 2626.20] Yeah.
[2626.34 → 2627.90] It was supposed to be three people at the VR booth?
[2628.00 → 2629.26] And he did the whole thing.
[2629.26 → 2630.28] Like, two, like, holding the base stations?
[2631.24 → 2631.94] Don't move.
[2632.52 → 2634.74] If the guy's a jerk to you, just, like, wiggle it a little bit.
[2635.08 → 2635.80] He's like, ah!
[2635.96 → 2636.52] Oh, no!
[2636.52 → 2638.38] Okay, super chats.
[2638.44 → 2639.26] Reading some super chats.
[2640.28 → 2641.34] Do-do-do-do.
[2642.54 → 2645.24] Would you, Luke, or Linus, do a Hot Ones episode?
[2646.36 → 2647.08] I'm sure.
[2647.32 → 2648.16] I don't see why not.
[2648.34 → 2648.86] Heck yeah.
[2649.34 → 2654.22] I mean, I'm not a super hot sauce aficionado, which probably isn't a popular thing to say.
[2654.60 → 2654.96] Are you?
[2655.16 → 2655.46] Is it?
[2655.46 → 2662.02] I, okay, so I really like hot sauce, and I really like spice, but I've never understood
[2662.02 → 2665.96] the macho component to it, and I really hate it when it gets past my limit.
[2666.10 → 2667.38] I have a relatively high limit.
[2667.42 → 2668.28] The macho component?
[2668.70 → 2671.16] It's like, oh, I can eat this supper hot spicy wing.
[2671.44 → 2673.70] There's totally, there's totally that aspect to it.
[2673.72 → 2675.52] Well, I mean, yeah, I guess so.
[2675.54 → 2679.94] But it's like all, did some ancestor, was he pretty good at it?
[2679.98 → 2680.98] No, hey, you are too.
[2681.38 → 2681.74] Congratulations.
[2681.74 → 2683.56] Well, it's like, yeah, it's like pain tolerance, I guess.
[2683.64 → 2686.52] It's like, oh, you must be really cool if you like the spicy stuff.
[2686.88 → 2690.24] But I think it's a sensitivity thing, not even necessarily a pain tolerance thing.
[2690.40 → 2694.60] Because there's some people that literally just don't feel it as much at all.
[2695.20 → 2700.54] People just aren't being sensitive to the differences between, no, it's true, though.
[2700.62 → 2701.24] But that, yeah.
[2701.50 → 2705.30] Well, so like, a lot of people that I know are really into hot sauce, and they're like,
[2705.30 → 2709.48] oh, you have to try this hot sauce, put this, I don't need anything without hot sauce.
[2709.60 → 2710.84] I'm just like, what?
[2711.36 → 2711.60] Why?
[2711.74 → 2712.70] I'm also like...
[2712.70 → 2716.12] There are lots of things that are cooked to have a specific level of flavour in different
[2716.12 → 2717.60] ways, and you're just destroying it.
[2717.78 → 2721.50] There's someone who is probably watching the show right now, MADE, hello.
[2721.80 → 2722.92] He doesn't have a sense of smell.
[2722.98 → 2723.74] He can't smell anything.
[2723.84 → 2724.06] Oh.
[2724.38 → 2726.68] So, hot things, no problem.
[2727.34 → 2729.38] He requires it, almost.
[2729.62 → 2731.22] It's no, yeah, it helps.
[2731.32 → 2732.64] Yeah, I can do that.
[2732.64 → 2737.28] But then he's like, I'm going to put this death sauce 99,000 on my food.
[2737.50 → 2738.42] And everyone else's.
[2738.42 → 2738.90] Ha ha ha ha.
[2739.04 → 2740.82] And it's like, whoa, slow down.
[2740.82 → 2741.94] Yeah, Geez, man.
[2741.94 → 2742.54] Geez.
[2742.54 → 2743.20] Um.
[2743.20 → 2744.20] Hi, MADE.
[2744.20 → 2745.78] No, hot sauce is cool.
[2745.78 → 2750.50] I think I like spicy food, but when it's like naturally spicy, I don't like want to put hot
[2750.50 → 2752.38] sauce on my cereal or something.
[2752.38 → 2752.88] Yeah.
[2752.88 → 2753.50] Ha ha ha.
[2753.50 → 2754.50] Exactly.
[2754.50 → 2757.22] Well, you're eating that just like with regular milk?
[2757.22 → 2758.22] Push.
[2758.22 → 2759.50] Okay.
[2759.50 → 2760.34] Riley.
[2760.34 → 2762.68] Don't you want to do something for Channel Super Fun?
[2762.68 → 2763.30] Two.
[2763.30 → 2764.72] Please make Luke laugh.
[2764.72 → 2767.18] I just love his pure, loud laugh.
[2767.18 → 2768.22] And your improvisation.
[2768.22 → 2769.22] Thanks.
[2769.22 → 2771.22] I feel like that's happened.
[2771.22 → 2772.22] Ha ha ha.
[2772.22 → 2773.22] Ha ha ha.
[2773.22 → 2774.22] A fair number of times.
[2774.22 → 2775.22] Uh, Channel Super Fun?
[2775.22 → 2779.34] I, uh, yeah, well, everyone wants to do something on Channel Super Fun.
[2779.34 → 2782.78] It's like, you know, I also want to fly, you know?
[2782.78 → 2784.40] I also want to shoot lasers out my eyes.
[2784.40 → 2785.40] Ha ha ha.
[2785.40 → 2789.16] We, we will do stuff on it again, I think at some point.
[2789.16 → 2789.90] But like, you know.
[2789.90 → 2790.90] Will we?
[2790.90 → 2791.90] I don't know.
[2791.90 → 2792.90] I can't guarantee.
[2792.90 → 2793.90] Yeah.
[2793.90 → 2794.08] I, I, I, I.
[2794.08 → 2797.28] But I think it's like, it's like something around here where we're all kind of like, man,
[2797.28 → 2799.68] ah, we really wish that we could do it.
[2799.68 → 2802.68] It would be a cool channel to revive, but yeah, it just doesn't make the most sense.
[2802.68 → 2803.68] Yeah.
[2803.68 → 2808.54] Uh, Syntax TV, I don't think you have, but he asked, hey Riley, I only got, I only really
[2808.54 → 2810.02] got Luke's opinion.
[2810.02 → 2811.58] What do you think of the song if you heard it?
[2811.58 → 2812.58] I'm assuming no.
[2812.58 → 2813.58] The LMG song.
[2813.58 → 2815.58] He made an LMG song.
[2815.58 → 2816.58] Like the intro song?
[2816.58 → 2817.58] No.
[2817.58 → 2821.58] He made an electronic song using normal electronic music plus.
[2821.58 → 2824.34] Oh wait, did he sample, and he sampled like Linus and you?
[2824.34 → 2825.34] Yeah.
[2825.34 → 2826.34] Yeah, yeah, I did hear that.
[2826.34 → 2827.34] That was super sweet.
[2827.34 → 2828.34] There we go.
[2828.34 → 2830.34] I saw, I, um, somebody like retweeted it on Twitter or something.
[2830.34 → 2831.34] Yeah.
[2831.34 → 2832.34] Yeah, and I saw it.
[2832.34 → 2833.34] That was sick, dude.
[2833.34 → 2834.34] Yeah.
[2834.34 → 2835.34] That was awesome.
[2835.34 → 2836.34] Glad to see you on the way on Riley.
[2836.34 → 2837.34] Love your videos.
[2837.34 → 2838.34] Uh, when are we going to.
[2838.34 → 2839.34] Okay, what are all these for me?
[2839.34 → 2840.34] Apparently.
[2840.34 → 2843.34] When are we going to be seeing your own YouTube channel again?
[2843.34 → 2844.34] Oh.
[2844.34 → 2846.34] Oh, that's embarrassing.
[2846.34 → 2847.34] Yeah.
[2847.34 → 2852.84] Um, yeah, well, that's a question for another time.
[2852.84 → 2858.10] I actually have a video in the pipe that I like filmed and half edited and I haven't
[2858.10 → 2859.10] gotten back to it.
[2859.10 → 2860.10] But, uh, that's really.
[2860.10 → 2862.10] Uh, someone said plug the LTT Discord.
[2862.10 → 2863.10] There's an LTT Discord.
[2863.10 → 2864.34] I don't actually know what the thing is.
[2864.34 → 2867.10] It's probably discorded.GG slash LTT, but I don't know.
[2867.10 → 2868.10] That would make sense.
[2868.10 → 2872.10] And someone said, nope, that's about it.
[2872.10 → 2873.58] Bungee is an individual dev.
[2873.58 → 2878.08] They need money to continue future updates moving forward towards a Diablo WoW concept.
[2878.08 → 2882.84] Most of the opinions of people that Bash Destiny didn't play D1 and only played the worst
[2882.84 → 2884.34] of D2.
[2884.34 → 2885.34] I don't know.
[2885.34 → 2886.34] Okay.
[2886.34 → 2887.34] Okay.
[2887.34 → 2888.84] Thanks for coming to the stream, everyone.
[2888.84 → 2889.84] I'll see you guys later.
[2889.84 → 2890.84] Love you so much.
[2890.84 → 2891.84] I'll see you next week.
[2891.84 → 2893.84] I won't, but see you later.
[2893.84 → 2895.84] Same bad time, same bad channel?
[2895.84 → 2896.84] Am I allowed to say that?
[2896.84 → 2897.84] We're not on TV.
[2897.84 → 2898.84] And we're not Batman.
[2898.84 → 2900.84] Legally, you cannot.
[2900.84 → 2906.84] Legally, this is highly concerning.
[2906.84 → 2912.84] Same tech time, same WAN channel.
[2912.84 → 2913.84] That sounds weird.
[2913.84 → 2914.84] Are we still alive?
[2914.84 → 2915.84] We technically are.
[2915.84 → 2916.84] Until they outro end?
[2916.84 → 2917.84] Yeah.
[2917.84 → 2918.84] See you later.
[2918.84 → 2919.84] Hey.
[2919.84 → 2920.84] Oh no, it's private internet access.
[2920.84 → 2921.84] Corsair, so sorry about the lower end.
[2921.84 → 2922.84] Corsair.
[2922.84 → 2923.84] Love you guys.
[2923.84 → 2924.84] Sorry.
[2924.84 → 2925.84] The Marinas.
[2925.84 → 2926.84] Marinas.
[2926.84 → 2927.84] I'm drinking it right now.
[2927.84 → 2928.84] Yay.
[2928.84 → 2929.84] You hear that?
[2929.84 → 2930.84] He did it.
[2930.84 → 2931.84] He did it.
[2931.84 → 2932.84] He did it.
[2932.84 → 2933.84] He did it.
[2933.84 → 2934.84] He did it.
[2934.84 → 2935.84] He did it.
[2935.84 → 2936.84] He did it.
[2936.84 → 2937.84] He did it.
[2937.84 → 2938.84] He did it.
[2938.84 → 2939.84] He did it.
[2939.84 → 2940.84] He did it.
