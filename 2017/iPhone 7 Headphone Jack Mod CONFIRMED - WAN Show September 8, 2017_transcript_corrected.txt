[0.00 → 2.76] Well, I mean make sure you like, oh we're live by the way, but.
[2.76 → 3.56] I'm going to try.
[3.56 → 6.08] Yeah, make sure you don't be an idiot about it.
[6.08 → 7.88] It'll probably be more interesting to work.
[7.88 → 12.88] Just being honest.
[12.88 → 16.04] Maybe I can try to recruit people while I'm there.
[16.04 → 19.56] I'll just like to get a sign, sit on the side of the road, be like, need developers, please
[19.56 → 20.56] help.
[20.56 → 27.56] If you know JavaScript, specifically Angular.
[27.56 → 30.56] Call me.
[30.56 → 34.56] Give me a call.
[34.56 → 35.56] Oh man.
[35.56 → 38.56] Oh, welcome to the WAN show you guys.
[38.56 → 39.56] Hey guys.
[39.56 → 44.56] Before the show, and then we usually try to do lunch once a week, but we missed last week
[44.56 → 46.56] and I think we missed the week before.
[46.56 → 47.56] Yeah.
[47.56 → 50.56] This is the only time Luke and I talk to each other anymore.
[50.56 → 51.56] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[51.56 → 54.56] So like, yeah, you'll have to forgive us.
[54.56 → 57.56] Honestly, it doesn't account for all of it.
[57.56 → 61.56] Part of it is that I was reviewing a script with Taken before this, and I was doing that
[61.56 → 66.56] late because I was building a machine with one of our DOG Rig Reboot winners right before
[66.56 → 67.56] that pretty banging machine.
[67.56 → 68.56] Did you see it?
[68.56 → 69.56] It looks really nice.
[69.56 → 70.56] Yeah.
[70.56 → 73.56] Didn't like really inspect it, but it looks really nice from afar.
[73.56 → 81.56] 7700K, 32 gigs RAM, RGB up the butt, 1080 Ti Strip, 165 Hertz monitor.
[81.56 → 84.56] Basically, as good as I would ever recommend.
[84.56 → 85.56] Awesome.
[85.56 → 86.56] That's cool.
[86.56 → 88.56] Like anything beyond that, you're like kind of dumb for gaming.
[88.56 → 90.56] Like really, really intense diminishing returns.
[90.56 → 91.56] Yeah, yeah.
[91.56 → 92.56] Or you do other things.
[92.56 → 93.56] Or literally worse.
[93.56 → 94.56] Yeah.
[94.56 → 95.56] Or you do something else.
[95.56 → 96.56] Yeah.
[96.56 → 98.56] So, yeah, we were just chatting about float plane.
[98.56 → 100.56] Luke is leaving the country.
[100.56 → 101.56] Yep.
[101.56 → 102.56] See ya.
[102.56 → 103.56] Not permanently.
[103.56 → 104.56] No one here will notice.
[104.56 → 105.56] Yeah.
[105.56 → 107.56] Well, they'll...
[107.56 → 109.56] What will they notice?
[109.56 → 112.56] They'll notice your car not in the parking lot.
[112.56 → 113.56] Ah, yes.
[113.56 → 114.56] Maybe.
[114.56 → 115.56] Yeah.
[115.56 → 116.56] That's about it.
[116.56 → 117.56] Yeah.
[117.56 → 118.56] Now that you have that like hidden away office.
[118.56 → 120.56] I have the furthest away from any entrance office as far as I know.
[120.56 → 121.56] Yep.
[121.56 → 126.56] Like the most awkward, you would only go there if you were going to my office possible location.
[126.56 → 129.56] And then I enter not from the main entrance now.
[129.56 → 130.56] Really?
[130.56 → 131.56] Well, I enter from that side.
[131.56 → 132.56] 104, I guess.
[132.56 → 134.56] And then I just do like a really quick loop.
[134.56 → 135.56] Yep.
[135.56 → 137.56] Go up here, basically your private stairwell.
[137.56 → 138.56] Yep.
[138.56 → 139.56] So...
[139.56 → 146.56] Anyway, Dennis just mentioned before the show that he's seen me like 10 times this year.
[146.56 → 149.56] Dennis, I think I'm less in focus now.
[149.56 → 150.56] Really?
[150.56 → 152.56] I think so.
[152.56 → 155.56] We have a mom, so while you're getting that in focus.
[155.56 → 156.56] Yeah.
[156.56 → 157.56] Perfect.
[157.56 → 158.56] Hi, mom.
[158.56 → 159.56] How are ya?
[159.56 → 160.56] I'm good.
[160.56 → 161.56] I miss you.
[161.56 → 162.56] I miss you too.
[162.56 → 164.56] This is probably the point where she mentions that I also don't see my mom.
[164.56 → 166.56] I'm not sending him anywhere unsafe.
[166.56 → 167.56] It's okay.
[167.56 → 170.56] Oh, I don't know if she knows that I'm going out of the country.
[170.56 → 171.56] Alright.
[171.56 → 173.56] I was just checking.
[173.56 → 174.56] Just checking.
[174.56 → 176.56] It's not like Somalia.
[176.56 → 177.56] No.
[177.56 → 178.56] It's fine.
[178.56 → 179.56] Yeah.
[179.56 → 182.56] So you are sending him somewhere.
[182.56 → 183.56] Well...
[183.56 → 184.56] I'm sending myself.
[184.56 → 185.56] Yeah.
[185.56 → 186.56] Yeah.
[186.56 → 187.56] Oh.
[187.56 → 195.56] I was the POO of that company, and he made an executive decision that he needed to have a meeting out of the country and informed me that he was going.
[195.56 → 196.56] Yeah.
[196.56 → 207.56] It sounds very much to me like Linus is working super, super hard to direct me in a different direction away from himself and that something is going on that I should be very concerned about.
[207.56 → 208.56] That's pretty conspiracy theory.
[208.56 → 210.56] I'm just going to put that out there.
[210.56 → 212.56] No, this was completely my idea.
[212.56 → 213.56] I'm going to Sweden.
[213.56 → 214.56] So like, it's not like I don't want to go there.
[214.56 → 216.56] Um, and I'm visiting a guy that I've known for a long time, and we're going to work on some float plane stuff.
[216.56 → 217.56] Okay.
[217.56 → 218.56] Alright.
[218.56 → 219.56] Alright.
[219.56 → 220.56] I can live with that.
[220.56 → 221.56] I can live with that.
[221.56 → 223.56] However, Luke, sometimes you forget the cardinal rule that is you do not leave the country without telling your mother.
[223.56 → 224.56] Right.
[224.56 → 225.56] I did sort of forget that part.
[225.56 → 228.56] I'm also leaving tomorrow.
[228.56 → 229.56] I haven't booked my ticket yet.
[229.56 → 230.56] What?
[230.56 → 231.56] It's fine.
[231.56 → 232.56] There are available tickets.
[232.56 → 234.18] OK.
[234.18 → 235.16] Oh yeah.
[235.16 → 237.04] I just fucked up.
[237.04 → 238.00] You talk with me over the ports.
[238.00 → 240.04] This is what we have, it looks like.
[240.04 → 243.24] It's going to be a nice day.
[243.24 → 244.36] Okay.
[244.36 → 245.24] Yeah.
[245.24 → 246.28] Alright.
[246.28 → 248.24] Hi, Liam.
[248.24 → 249.24] Hi, Jamie.
[249.24 → 251.24] Thank you, Jamie.
[251.80 → 252.36] No movie.
[252.36 → 252.68] That's alright.
[252.68 → 253.42] Hawaii is that nice.
[253.42 → 256.12] He's getting mothered on both sides right now, by the way.
[256.42 → 258.20] Just so you know, I'm with you on this.
[259.10 → 259.46] Awesome.
[259.88 → 260.52] That's great.
[260.62 → 261.50] Thank you, Linus.
[263.48 → 264.12] It'll work.
[264.32 → 265.08] It'll be fine.
[265.16 → 265.32] Yeah.
[266.00 → 266.20] Yeah.
[266.44 → 266.80] Sure.
[267.60 → 267.96] Sure.
[269.46 → 273.46] I have a place to stay that I can't really detail, but I do have a place to stay this
[273.46 → 273.66] time.
[273.76 → 275.52] I have travelled without a place to stay before.
[276.22 → 277.08] This is an improvement.
[278.16 → 278.52] Yeah.
[278.86 → 280.88] I think I don't want to know anymore.
[282.10 → 282.82] All right.
[282.82 → 284.60] Well, thank you for calling in.
[284.66 → 285.50] It's always a pleasure.
[286.02 → 286.40] All right.
[286.42 → 287.64] Always a pleasure, Linus.
[287.72 → 288.12] Bye.
[288.34 → 288.70] Okay.
[288.80 → 288.98] Bye.
[289.90 → 290.62] Love you, too.
[290.74 → 291.00] Bye.
[291.74 → 292.34] All right.
[292.36 → 294.60] So we've got a great show for you guys today.
[294.98 → 299.98] Intel's 18-core high-end desktop die has been pictured.
[300.80 → 310.36] The iPhone 8 is rumoured to cost more due to Samsung's control of OLED display supply.
[310.36 → 310.46] Okay.
[312.22 → 315.56] Apparently, we're putting a headphone jack back into the iPhone 7.
[315.60 → 317.20] Well, we're not, but some guy did it.
[317.20 → 323.48] Oh, this is the same guy, I believe, that built his own iPhone out of a bunch of little
[323.48 → 323.96] components.
[324.10 → 324.82] Did you hear about that?
[324.94 → 325.18] Okay.
[325.28 → 325.46] That, no.
[325.46 → 326.52] I believe this is the same guy.
[326.60 → 331.42] So he went to China and went to the little shops that had little individual iPhone components,
[331.52 → 333.74] and he built his whole own one that works and stuff.
[333.74 → 336.00] And, like, the Touch ID and everything functions.
[336.40 → 336.76] Really?
[336.88 → 337.58] It's pretty cool.
[337.70 → 341.68] It took him months, but then he was, like, travelling in and out because he was, like,
[341.72 → 343.04] working there and doing all this kind of stuff.
[343.08 → 345.30] And he was doing it just, like, over time on the side.
[345.34 → 346.48] It's a really cool video series.
[346.58 → 348.20] It's quite a long video, but it's fascinating.
[348.64 → 351.20] I believe this is the same guy, but I'm not 100% certain.
[351.46 → 354.80] And then AMD Vega 11 enters production.
[355.50 → 357.28] Dun, dun, dun.
[357.28 → 358.28] Dun, dun.
[358.96 → 359.92] Intro time.
[360.26 → 361.90] Oh, oh, I'm going to use the stream deck.
[362.10 → 362.60] Stream deck.
[364.88 → 365.84] Didn't work.
[366.82 → 367.26] What?
[367.34 → 367.52] Really?
[368.62 → 369.88] I tested this last week.
[369.88 → 370.98] Didn't work again.
[371.36 → 371.72] Are you?
[371.80 → 372.66] Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[372.72 → 373.32] I love it.
[373.48 → 375.72] Are you using the, uh, are you using the.
[375.72 → 376.50] I'm not using anything.
[376.98 → 377.90] Uh, hold on, hold on.
[377.96 → 380.24] Are you using the exp let broadcaster PTR?
[381.00 → 381.92] I don't think so.
[382.18 → 383.06] I didn't watch this.
[383.10 → 385.70] Oh, we have to use the public test release if we want that.
[385.70 → 385.94] Oh.
[386.26 → 386.78] That's fine.
[386.78 → 387.70] Yeah, I didn't watch this.
[387.72 → 389.08] It was already set up when I got here.
[389.18 → 389.82] Hashtag Gwen Fulton.
[390.02 → 390.14] Yeah.
[390.32 → 390.78] Yeah, okay.
[390.88 → 392.44] So just to talk about.
[392.50 → 392.84] Oh, no.
[392.92 → 393.54] We're playing the intro.
[394.32 → 394.98] Yeah, look.
[396.22 → 397.12] Those are his only two videos.
[399.94 → 400.30] Yeah.
[402.80 → 403.20] Huh.
[403.68 → 404.24] How about that?
[409.82 → 411.02] Mac Weldon.
[411.66 → 412.32] Dun, dun, dun, dun.
[412.32 → 414.42] Oh, I didn't put on the shirt before the show.
[414.42 → 416.86] I'm going to have to change into it and risk a nip slip.
[417.68 → 418.20] Oh, my.
[418.44 → 418.92] Dang it.
[419.32 → 420.44] I'll body block you.
[420.76 → 423.34] Twitch's terms of service are going to be the end of me.
[423.84 → 424.08] Yep.
[427.58 → 428.52] All right.
[428.72 → 429.88] Damn nipple equality.
[429.88 → 432.12] Oh, wait.
[432.12 → 432.48] Hold on.
[432.54 → 432.62] Yeah.
[432.80 → 434.72] Ah, and we're back.
[435.80 → 436.88] Oh, man.
[437.48 → 443.92] I am excited for today's show for one reason, and that is that I didn't do the...
[443.92 → 445.20] Okay, so I think I figured it out.
[445.68 → 451.74] It's when we put the computer to sleep and wake it back up with XSplit still running that
[451.74 → 453.24] the capture cards.
[454.04 → 454.44] Oh.
[455.24 → 455.36] Yeah.
[455.70 → 456.18] Don't die.
[456.28 → 458.32] So I have solved the mystery.
[458.70 → 459.10] Okay.
[459.34 → 460.08] The camera just...
[460.08 → 460.44] No, no.
[460.52 → 461.14] That's fine.
[461.58 → 462.06] It's fine.
[462.12 → 462.66] It'll come back.
[462.72 → 463.80] That one's already working, though.
[463.82 → 464.26] Give it a sec.
[464.34 → 464.76] Hold on.
[465.24 → 466.26] Just give it a sec.
[466.48 → 466.90] It's all good.
[467.04 → 467.58] Everything's good.
[467.58 → 470.34] You can tell which one the camera one is by the way it is.
[470.72 → 471.50] Everything's amazing.
[471.74 → 472.36] Oh, yeah.
[472.44 → 473.70] I guess I could have done that.
[474.02 → 474.46] Okay.
[474.46 → 481.02] So our first topic was posted by the Benjamin son the forum, and the original article here
[481.02 → 482.98] is from hexis.net.
[484.22 → 486.40] Famous overclocked, Der Bauer.
[486.54 → 491.66] You know why I think Der Bauer does so well, even though professional overclockers generally
[491.66 → 495.76] are really well known within the professional overclocking community?
[496.20 → 497.78] So basically, it's a big circle.
[497.78 → 498.14] No worlds.
[498.36 → 499.80] Circle congratulation.
[501.46 → 502.76] Circle congratulation.
[502.76 → 503.14] I think so.
[504.46 → 507.12] I have to use that.
[507.38 → 513.34] I think the reason that he has kind of broken out into the mainstream is the guy's got a
[513.34 → 513.84] personality.
[514.14 → 514.44] He does.
[514.54 → 514.98] I've met him.
[515.00 → 515.48] He's cool.
[515.62 → 515.78] Yeah.
[515.84 → 517.44] Well, I haven't met him, but I like his videos.
[517.52 → 517.72] Yeah.
[517.86 → 519.26] Like, he's actually super cool.
[519.34 → 521.96] I ran into him at Computer.
[522.16 → 524.42] And he's roasted us before, and I still like his videos.
[524.48 → 524.76] Really?
[524.94 → 525.62] I didn't even know that.
[525.62 → 528.06] Well, he roasted, like, YouTube tech reviewers.
[528.94 → 530.36] And I was like, all right.
[530.66 → 531.08] All right.
[531.26 → 532.14] Roman, let's talk.
[534.46 → 537.12] Am I included with YouTube tech reviewers?
[537.98 → 538.64] You might be.
[538.96 → 540.42] I don't review anything anymore.
[540.84 → 541.16] Oh.
[541.72 → 542.66] I mean, if you think about it.
[542.72 → 546.06] I mean, there's still, like, graphs and opinions in our videos.
[546.06 → 546.74] We do graphs.
[546.88 → 547.20] Okay, fine.
[547.20 → 548.16] Which is, like, a form of...
[548.16 → 548.50] That's okay.
[548.90 → 549.40] I'm over it.
[549.46 → 549.70] Okay.
[549.86 → 555.16] So, right here, on the left, is the 7900X.
[555.32 → 558.70] So, this is the 10-core Core i9.
[558.90 → 571.12] And on the right is the utterly massive 18-core die of the upcoming 7920X.
[571.12 → 574.60] So, there are a couple of takeaways here.
[574.72 → 582.44] Number one is that, in case you were wondering, 18 cores mean a bigger die than 10 cores, which
[582.44 → 588.38] will hopefully have at least some positive effect on our ability to cool this bloody thing.
[588.38 → 594.02] Because we actually have a video coming on de-linking Intel processors.
[594.36 → 595.64] That's coming really soon.
[595.76 → 597.54] We do the mainstream and the high-end.
[597.74 → 597.86] Nice.
[597.92 → 601.78] So, we strip down a 7900X because we can.
[601.90 → 604.00] We almost did it for...
[604.00 → 604.98] Nope, can't talk about it.
[607.04 → 610.74] I don't even know about this.
[611.02 → 611.58] But didn't.
[612.66 → 613.14] Oh.
[613.48 → 613.84] Yeah.
[614.24 → 614.76] Wait, what?
[615.00 → 615.50] Never mind.
[615.82 → 616.20] Oh.
[616.20 → 616.86] Move on.
[619.38 → 619.82] Continue.
[621.14 → 621.62] Okay.
[623.40 → 624.82] Where was I going with this?
[624.88 → 625.08] Right.
[625.58 → 630.50] So, we know that it's bigger, which will hopefully help us move heat away from it because hopefully
[630.50 → 634.36] the heat density won't be any higher.
[634.52 → 639.54] So, if we just put a really powerful cooler on it that's got an enormous cooling plate, then
[639.54 → 641.26] maybe we'll be okay.
[641.26 → 649.02] And it also tells us, based on that, that's a shiny, clean die that Intel is still using
[649.02 → 655.18] an easy-to-clean thermal interface material rather than soldering the die.
[655.18 → 662.10] So, as some of you probably know, AMD is soldering the dies on their Ry zen and Thread ripper chips.
[662.64 → 666.02] I do still intend to try to deal with a Thread ripper.
[666.16 → 667.76] It should theoretically be possible.
[668.48 → 672.46] Because, did you see the vanity Thread rippers that they provided to YouTubers?
[673.14 → 673.36] No.
[673.36 → 674.36] And influencers.
[674.88 → 679.36] So, it's a Thread ripper chip with your publication name.
[679.60 → 680.50] Oh, that's pretty cool.
[680.50 → 681.22] Lasered into the top.
[681.36 → 681.56] Yeah.
[681.82 → 682.84] So, but it doesn't work.
[683.50 → 684.74] Well, I want it to work.
[684.90 → 686.50] So, you're going to take that off and swap it with it.
[686.60 → 687.18] That's cool.
[687.30 → 687.56] Yeah.
[687.82 → 690.90] So, that's going to be a video project sometime in the next little bit here.
[690.90 → 692.82] What's the theory?
[693.44 → 694.02] The theory...
[694.02 → 694.70] The hypothesis.
[694.90 → 696.10] How are you going to go about this?
[696.12 → 701.08] So, I plan to do it the same way that I did the QX6700 way back in the day.
[701.90 → 702.28] Okay.
[702.46 → 705.06] So, what I did was I carefully...
[705.06 → 708.50] And I'm going to use the dead one to investigate how well it works.
[708.56 → 708.68] Yeah.
[708.68 → 709.72] Because what do I have to lose?
[709.76 → 710.30] It's a dead one.
[710.44 → 710.54] Yeah.
[711.12 → 713.50] So, I'll cut the seal all around it.
[713.72 → 717.70] And so, you just had to be really careful that you didn't go too deep with the razor blade
[717.70 → 719.82] so you don't cut off a resistor or something.
[720.06 → 720.20] Yeah.
[720.20 → 726.98] So, then what I did was I just put some thermal paste on it, put it onto a pot, and then put
[726.98 → 728.62] the pot on a hot element on the stove.
[729.72 → 730.12] Okay.
[730.36 → 738.84] That way, as soon as the solder gets hot enough, it'll release, and you can just pop it off
[738.84 → 740.48] and get it away from the hot element.
[740.56 → 744.40] So, that way you don't heat it up any more than you have to, and also you don't heat up
[744.40 → 748.62] any part of the chip that you don't have to any more than you have to.
[748.64 → 749.06] That makes sense.
[749.06 → 752.20] Because I was thinking you were going to have to heat it in some way, and I was worried
[752.20 → 753.42] that you'd fry it that way.
[754.74 → 755.06] Yeah.
[755.16 → 758.04] So, the QX6700 that I did back in the day did survive.
[758.28 → 762.58] And then the way that I got the solder off was actually just with a plastic scraping tool
[762.58 → 764.30] and a lot of patience.
[764.30 → 767.38] So, that's my plan, and we'll see if it works.
[767.38 → 770.88] Maybe Twitch chat is telling me about how it's not going to work.
[770.88 → 774.88] In the dashboard, it's just full of people getting timeouts.
[775.06 → 779.64] So, maybe I'll have to go to the public view to see the actual Twitch chat.
[779.78 → 780.00] Yeah.
[780.30 → 783.14] Hopefully, I can hit the pause button before we get an echo.
[783.30 → 787.44] Apparently, people are pretty rousted about how out of focus we are right now.
[788.16 → 789.32] Um, I don't know.
[789.42 → 789.68] What's the thing?
[789.68 → 790.36] Oh, damn.
[790.68 → 791.12] Oh, damn.
[791.24 → 792.06] Colton's going to get up on here.
[792.06 → 794.66] We've had camera people come in and try and do it twice.
[794.90 → 796.08] Oh, you look out of focus.
[796.36 → 797.18] I don't know about myself.
[797.32 → 798.10] I just look shiny.
[798.22 → 798.96] Yeah, I think we're both the same.
[799.08 → 799.84] Okay, tell you what.
[799.92 → 800.36] Tell you what.
[800.88 → 803.04] Just for you guys, we're going to pause the show.
[803.40 → 803.94] We're going to...
[803.94 → 804.58] Okay, Colton.
[804.98 → 805.32] Colton.
[805.68 → 809.24] Um, the wheel on the front.
[809.38 → 809.96] What are you doing?
[809.96 → 810.58] On the lens.
[810.82 → 812.50] It looks like Linus is wearing green lipstick.
[812.62 → 812.78] Okay.
[812.82 → 813.34] Let's take a picture.
[813.42 → 813.82] Let's do it.
[813.88 → 814.34] Let's do it.
[814.38 → 814.58] Okay.
[814.84 → 815.14] Okay.
[816.14 → 817.08] No, worse.
[817.44 → 818.12] Ask AVE.
[818.28 → 819.00] I'd love to.
[819.26 → 820.58] We tried to contact him.
[820.66 → 821.38] Okay, other way.
[821.64 → 822.44] He was like, meh.
[823.10 → 823.74] Other way.
[823.82 → 824.62] That looks good, no?
[825.12 → 825.66] Not quite.
[825.78 → 826.36] No, too far.
[828.82 → 829.30] That...
[829.30 → 830.16] Oh, a little bit.
[830.24 → 831.18] Yeah, that looks good.
[831.84 → 832.52] Ah, it's still a little soft.
[832.52 → 834.68] I mean, we're like right up against this now anyway.
[834.92 → 836.10] It's actually still...
[836.10 → 837.18] Yeah, it's really soft.
[837.28 → 837.44] Yeah.
[837.44 → 839.04] I don't even get this.
[839.28 → 840.56] Like, where are we in front?
[840.58 → 841.96] I think it's like way up here.
[842.04 → 843.32] Okay, you have to come further back this way.
[843.42 → 843.88] Come on back.
[845.04 → 846.04] Yeah, it's like here.
[846.96 → 848.90] My hand is nice and in focus.
[849.02 → 849.48] Oh, too far.
[850.26 → 851.28] Well, that's not...
[851.28 → 852.02] That's not better.
[852.22 → 852.38] Okay.
[852.38 → 852.92] That's a lot better.
[852.92 → 853.38] Let's go with that.
[853.46 → 854.10] Let's go with that.
[854.14 → 854.46] All right?
[854.58 → 854.96] All right.
[856.64 → 857.26] Okay, cool.
[857.34 → 858.28] So what else do we know about it?
[858.28 → 860.32] We know depth of field and focus of different things.
[861.02 → 863.98] What I was saying was we could get one with a wider one
[863.98 → 866.26] so that it seems like we're more in focus more often
[866.26 → 868.30] because the focus is a constant problem.
[868.54 → 868.68] Yeah.
[868.68 → 871.26] So we could turn fewer apertures
[871.26 → 875.64] and then deeper depth of focus field.
[875.86 → 876.04] Okay.
[877.04 → 881.72] The iPhone 8 will apparently cost more
[881.72 → 885.80] because Samsung is controlling OLED supply.
[885.80 → 893.62] also there will apparently be no touch ID due to 3D touch.
[893.70 → 896.04] So this was posted by RedRound2 on the forum
[896.04 → 900.38] and the original article here is from 9to5Mac.
[901.38 → 903.52] What I want to know, 9to5Mac,
[903.60 → 906.18] is why you guys aren't willing to put in the extra hours.
[907.68 → 909.08] Typical employer question.
[909.58 → 910.32] Look at these guys.
[910.40 → 912.00] They even want to be paid for their lunch.
[912.00 → 912.44] Wow.
[912.44 → 914.32] They only work 8 actual hours.
[914.32 → 914.60] Wow.
[914.86 → 916.76] So they probably take a half hour lunch.
[916.90 → 919.50] They probably take two 15-minute smoke breaks.
[920.74 → 921.96] Come on, you guys.
[922.46 → 922.94] Smoking.
[923.08 → 923.72] You're disappointing.
[923.90 → 924.92] You're disappointing me here.
[924.98 → 925.88] You're disappointing me here.
[925.96 → 926.14] Okay?
[926.14 → 932.62] So let's go ahead and run through what we got here.
[933.22 → 936.50] So the new iPhone's display is expected to include
[936.50 → 938.38] a flexible OLED panel,
[938.78 → 940.02] an OLED touch panel,
[940.28 → 942.06] a 3D touch module,
[942.40 → 944.30] and an OLED panel module.
[944.52 → 949.40] But Samsung will be responsible for providing each OLED part
[949.40 → 951.40] with the only exception in the stack
[951.40 → 953.22] being the 3D touch module.
[953.46 → 954.12] So normally,
[954.78 → 956.74] Apple will leverage multiple suppliers.
[957.86 → 959.32] This helps keep costs low.
[959.50 → 961.80] And they've even gone as far
[961.80 → 965.34] as to use both TSMC and Global Foundries
[965.34 → 966.22] to...
[966.22 → 966.50] Oh, wait.
[966.52 → 967.76] Is it TSMC and Global Foundries?
[967.90 → 968.74] Or was it...
[968.74 → 970.22] Were they using Samsung as a fab?
[971.00 → 971.40] I can't recall.
[971.40 → 972.90] I'm not sure, but they've used multiple fabs
[972.90 → 974.88] for their actual, like, compute chips.
[975.18 → 976.74] Sorry, it's TSMC and Samsung.
[976.82 → 977.68] A lot less common.
[977.68 → 980.02] Have they ever made a chip in Global Foundries?
[982.52 → 986.18] Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[986.78 → 987.12] No.
[987.26 → 990.70] Makes last-minute decision to use TSMC for 30% of A9 chip.
[991.54 → 994.70] Facing poor yield rates from chipmaker Global Foundries
[994.70 → 996.34] to solidify its chain, etc.
[997.16 → 999.46] Samsung Global Foundries to produce 14...
[999.46 → 999.64] Okay.
[999.96 → 1000.60] So it looks like...
[1000.60 → 1000.82] Whatever.
[1000.96 → 1001.56] The point is,
[1001.62 → 1003.64] they've gone as far as to dual-source
[1003.64 → 1006.98] even the CPUs in their phones.
[1006.98 → 1007.92] Which is pretty ballsy.
[1007.98 → 1008.90] Not that many people do that.
[1009.24 → 1010.50] Which is super ballsy,
[1010.56 → 1013.26] because even if you make the same CPU
[1013.26 → 1015.80] at the same process node,
[1016.30 → 1016.94] Samsung's,
[1017.20 → 1017.74] Intel's,
[1017.94 → 1018.78] Global Foundries,
[1018.94 → 1019.66] TSMC's,
[1020.02 → 1021.40] all of their technology,
[1021.68 → 1022.96] even on the same node,
[1023.04 → 1024.58] is going to be slightly different
[1024.58 → 1026.08] with different characteristics.
[1026.08 → 1028.30] So one might consume more power,
[1028.44 → 1030.22] one might clock a little higher,
[1030.36 → 1032.00] one might do both,
[1032.06 → 1032.84] one might do neither.
[1032.96 → 1034.82] You never actually know
[1034.82 → 1037.62] until you've actually got silicon in hand
[1037.62 → 1039.86] what some of the quirks
[1039.86 → 1042.02] of a manufacturing process will be.
[1042.56 → 1044.20] So in this case,
[1044.72 → 1046.94] they are not able to take advantage
[1046.94 → 1048.12] of an additional supplier,
[1048.12 → 1049.96] and it looks like...
[1049.96 → 1050.56] Oh, sorry?
[1050.80 → 1052.16] It looks like the OLED unit
[1052.16 → 1056.76] is estimated to cost $120 to $130 per screen
[1056.76 → 1060.36] versus the $45 to $55 per unit cost
[1060.36 → 1062.02] of LCD panels.
[1063.58 → 1065.32] Do you think anyone's going to care?
[1066.32 → 1068.94] Do you think anyone that buys iPhones consistently
[1068.94 → 1070.06] and has been for a while
[1070.06 → 1070.66] is going to be affected by this price?
[1070.66 → 1071.92] Is going to care it's $100 more?
[1072.04 → 1072.44] Yeah.
[1072.44 → 1076.98] You know, let me think for a second,
[1077.08 → 1077.76] because...
[1078.96 → 1080.10] Okay, someone will care.
[1080.22 → 1081.78] How much of an impact do you think it'll make?
[1081.86 → 1083.16] With the amount of whinging
[1083.16 → 1086.02] that I've seen over the Galaxy Note 8's price,
[1086.40 → 1088.98] which is actually about $100 more
[1088.98 → 1090.92] than an S8 Plus,
[1091.86 → 1094.58] and for your $100, you get a stylus.
[1097.28 → 1097.72] Okay.
[1098.24 → 1099.52] My point here, though,
[1099.60 → 1101.62] is that it's Apple customers
[1101.62 → 1103.10] instead of Samsung customers.
[1104.10 → 1104.84] That's fair,
[1105.04 → 1108.02] but I would argue that a Note customer is...
[1108.02 → 1109.98] Is pretty close to an Apple customer?
[1110.12 → 1111.28] Pretty close to an Apple customer.
[1111.36 → 1111.50] Yeah.
[1111.50 → 1113.06] Because I think the Note customer
[1113.06 → 1117.52] is locked into a way of using the device
[1117.52 → 1120.08] that goes beyond Android.
[1120.76 → 1121.06] Right.
[1121.26 → 1122.74] Because there's a feature
[1122.74 → 1125.76] that is literally not on something else
[1125.76 → 1127.38] that they value.
[1127.56 → 1127.72] Yeah.
[1127.72 → 1129.68] And so, you know,
[1129.68 → 1131.32] I don't think for $100
[1131.32 → 1134.82] that it's that big of a deal,
[1134.94 → 1135.96] but there were a lot of people
[1135.96 → 1137.28] who were pretty butt hurt.
[1137.44 → 1137.68] Now...
[1138.34 → 1139.36] Oh, actually,
[1139.46 → 1140.76] I wanted to address another quick thing
[1140.76 → 1141.64] about the Note 8 video.
[1141.80 → 1142.80] Some people were upset
[1142.80 → 1143.96] that I was...
[1143.96 → 1145.52] That I was freaking out
[1145.52 → 1146.90] about the 200 William hour
[1146.90 → 1148.04] smaller battery
[1148.04 → 1148.74] on the Note 8
[1148.74 → 1150.06] versus the S8 Plus.
[1150.46 → 1151.84] Saying that the Note 8
[1151.84 → 1153.06] gets better battery life
[1153.06 → 1153.92] than the S8 Plus.
[1154.26 → 1155.30] To that, I would say,
[1155.42 → 1157.30] yeah, that may be true for now,
[1157.30 → 1158.86] but you also have to remember
[1158.86 → 1161.76] that the Note 8 also has...
[1161.76 → 1162.54] I can't remember.
[1162.60 → 1163.62] They don't call it Touch ID anymore,
[1163.86 → 1165.58] but whatever Samsung's UI is.
[1165.70 → 1165.86] Yeah.
[1165.96 → 1169.30] The Note 8 also has Touch ID features
[1169.30 → 1171.18] that the S8 Plus doesn't have
[1171.18 → 1173.54] because it gets a new version
[1173.54 → 1174.14] of the software.
[1174.50 → 1175.74] The fact that they're running
[1175.74 → 1178.30] the same CPU with...
[1179.24 → 1180.40] Actually, I believe the Note 8
[1180.40 → 1181.36] has more RAM,
[1181.66 → 1183.86] depending on the storage version
[1183.86 → 1184.82] of the S8 Plus.
[1184.94 → 1185.04] Right.
[1185.04 → 1186.06] Don't quote me on that one.
[1186.06 → 1187.02] But basically,
[1187.20 → 1188.04] there's nothing about
[1188.04 → 1189.36] the S8 Plus
[1189.36 → 1190.60] that consumes more power
[1190.60 → 1191.24] than the Note 8.
[1192.36 → 1193.54] It has a smaller display,
[1193.86 → 1194.28] marginally.
[1195.06 → 1195.58] So,
[1196.38 → 1199.56] there will be a difference,
[1199.98 → 1201.34] even if there isn't today.
[1201.78 → 1203.32] Even if, at launch,
[1203.54 → 1205.38] Samsung is positioning
[1205.38 → 1206.24] the Note 8
[1206.24 → 1207.56] as having better battery life
[1207.56 → 1208.36] by including optimizations.
[1208.36 → 1208.42] Some of the chat,
[1208.42 → 1209.22] all capital letters,
[1209.36 → 1210.48] quoting you on that one.
[1211.06 → 1211.82] That's okay.
[1211.98 → 1212.58] You go ahead.
[1213.46 → 1215.16] Get ready for the rage, Linus.
[1215.16 → 1217.02] Is this panel cracked?
[1219.58 → 1222.02] What the crap just happened?
[1224.56 → 1226.28] I think my screen is scratched.
[1226.54 → 1227.52] That sucks.
[1227.92 → 1229.30] I really like this laptop.
[1232.46 → 1232.90] Damn.
[1232.90 → 1233.46] That does suck.
[1233.64 → 1234.66] Okay, I'm sad now.
[1234.66 → 1234.90] Where?
[1235.02 → 1235.68] I don't see...
[1235.68 → 1236.14] Oh!
[1236.48 → 1236.88] Right there.
[1236.88 → 1238.02] Like, it just looks like
[1238.02 → 1238.98] a little hair on there,
[1239.06 → 1239.68] but it's not.
[1240.58 → 1241.92] No, that really sucks.
[1242.68 → 1243.30] Okay, so...
[1243.30 → 1243.48] Show us.
[1243.54 → 1244.22] It's not going to show up
[1244.22 → 1244.90] in camera very well.
[1244.90 → 1246.32] So, back to your question.
[1246.52 → 1248.46] Do I think that the $100...
[1248.46 → 1249.50] So, I wouldn't have.
[1250.12 → 1250.50] Okay.
[1250.60 → 1251.84] Unless you had seen that.
[1252.00 → 1252.90] Except that people
[1252.90 → 1254.40] were so upset
[1254.40 → 1255.42] about the extra $100
[1255.42 → 1256.54] for the Note 8.
[1258.74 → 1259.30] That's fair.
[1259.30 → 1260.46] I think...
[1260.46 → 1261.58] I don't think it's going to affect
[1261.58 → 1262.72] a lot of purchasing decisions,
[1262.86 → 1263.74] but it might hurt
[1263.74 → 1265.84] some fanboy mentality.
[1267.04 → 1268.08] I don't know.
[1268.46 → 1269.72] The Apple fan
[1269.72 → 1271.36] behaves a little differently...
[1271.36 → 1271.66] They do.
[1271.78 → 1273.26] ...than the typical fan.
[1273.36 → 1274.90] Like, they tend to defend
[1274.90 → 1276.22] Apple's need to make
[1276.22 → 1277.44] a profit on their devices.
[1278.60 → 1280.22] They tend to defend
[1280.22 → 1282.18] the sort of disparity
[1282.18 → 1283.70] between Apple's costs
[1283.70 → 1284.62] and their pricing.
[1285.32 → 1286.52] You're totally right,
[1286.78 → 1287.38] and I don't think
[1287.38 → 1288.34] it's completely changed,
[1288.34 → 1289.08] but it's been changing
[1289.08 → 1289.64] a little bit.
[1289.84 → 1290.80] I don't feel like people
[1290.80 → 1291.94] just auto-buy
[1291.94 → 1293.02] everything from them anymore.
[1294.10 → 1294.88] And we saw that
[1294.88 → 1295.46] with the watch.
[1297.06 → 1297.62] The Apple Watch
[1297.62 → 1298.72] didn't actually sell that well.
[1299.08 → 1299.78] Watches in general
[1299.78 → 1300.74] didn't actually sell that well.
[1300.86 → 1301.46] Yeah, smartwatches
[1301.46 → 1302.12] seem to be just...
[1302.12 → 1303.08] Tablets are going
[1303.08 → 1303.78] super down.
[1303.92 → 1304.08] Yep.
[1304.74 → 1305.70] No one cares about
[1305.70 → 1306.58] a new iPad anymore,
[1306.76 → 1307.62] which is why Apple
[1307.62 → 1308.52] did that commodity,
[1308.68 → 1309.26] basically like
[1309.26 → 1310.76] education edition iPad.
[1313.62 → 1314.02] Honestly,
[1314.44 → 1315.46] okay.
[1316.30 → 1317.30] I think the $100
[1317.30 → 1318.62] would be pretty easy
[1318.62 → 1319.10] to swallow
[1319.10 → 1320.98] if Apple was bringing
[1320.98 → 1321.96] something game-changing
[1321.96 → 1322.56] to the table.
[1322.76 → 1323.86] And I think that's where
[1323.86 → 1325.02] Samsung ran into trouble
[1325.02 → 1325.52] a little bit,
[1325.58 → 1326.58] because my biggest issue
[1326.58 → 1327.12] with the Note 8
[1327.12 → 1327.94] wasn't that it's
[1327.94 → 1328.78] not a great phone.
[1328.82 → 1329.42] It's a great phone.
[1329.64 → 1330.22] It does everything.
[1331.00 → 1332.20] My issue with the Note 8
[1332.20 → 1333.42] was that it was really safe.
[1334.58 → 1334.72] Yeah.
[1334.82 → 1335.78] They basically made
[1335.78 → 1336.36] a Note 7
[1336.36 → 1338.46] with a smaller battery.
[1338.96 → 1339.58] Uh-huh.
[1339.58 → 1341.30] And...
[1341.30 → 1343.72] Like, what did they add again?
[1343.94 → 1344.34] Oh, man.
[1344.42 → 1345.32] Right, dual camera.
[1345.44 → 1346.04] It has a dual camera on it.
[1346.04 → 1347.00] I'm not super surprised.
[1347.22 → 1348.06] The dual camera's
[1348.06 → 1350.20] really not that impressive.
[1350.80 → 1351.78] So that was where
[1351.78 → 1352.56] we ran into trouble.
[1352.82 → 1354.18] The big highlight feature,
[1354.32 → 1355.14] the dual camera,
[1355.96 → 1357.10] didn't blow my mind,
[1357.62 → 1359.32] and so it's an extra $100
[1359.32 → 1361.06] for someone who's not
[1361.06 → 1362.16] a heavy stylus user.
[1362.52 → 1362.80] Beech.
[1362.80 → 1363.94] I don't really care.
[1364.38 → 1364.96] Whereas here,
[1365.36 → 1366.36] if the iPhone 8
[1366.36 → 1367.28] has this, like,
[1367.48 → 1369.38] basically floor-to-ceiling,
[1369.56 → 1371.62] wall-to-wall display surface,
[1372.20 → 1373.96] and people are really into that,
[1374.06 → 1374.80] then an extra $100
[1374.80 → 1376.02] might not be a big deal.
[1376.14 → 1378.70] But kind of killer
[1378.70 → 1379.74] for me on it
[1379.74 → 1381.14] is this is how
[1381.14 → 1382.00] I take out my iPhone.
[1382.82 → 1384.82] I lift it up to my face
[1384.82 → 1385.50] like this,
[1385.84 → 1386.92] and Touch ID
[1386.92 → 1388.48] has unlocked the phone
[1388.48 → 1390.56] before I would ever
[1390.56 → 1391.44] get a chance
[1391.44 → 1394.52] to align the phone
[1394.52 → 1395.48] with my eyes
[1395.48 → 1397.84] and unlock it
[1397.84 → 1399.08] with my irises.
[1399.84 → 1400.96] Well before that.
[1401.08 → 1402.10] He just did both of those,
[1402.18 → 1402.52] by the way.
[1402.76 → 1403.42] The rumour
[1403.42 → 1405.40] is that
[1405.40 → 1407.40] the iPhone 8
[1407.40 → 1408.28] or whatever they end up
[1408.28 → 1408.68] calling it,
[1408.72 → 1409.42] iPhone Edition,
[1410.08 → 1411.46] the rumour is that
[1411.46 → 1412.28] it will rely on
[1412.28 → 1413.18] facial recognition
[1413.18 → 1414.86] and old-school typed passwords
[1414.86 → 1416.32] instead of Touch ID
[1416.32 → 1417.22] because
[1417.22 → 1419.20] their plan
[1419.20 → 1419.78] to embed
[1419.78 → 1421.08] a Touch ID sensor
[1421.08 → 1422.28] under the display
[1422.28 → 1423.86] is rumoured to be cancelled
[1423.86 → 1425.38] since OLED creates
[1425.38 → 1426.38] an unfavourable
[1426.38 → 1427.18] scan-through
[1427.18 → 1428.68] scenario
[1428.68 → 1430.30] for the fingerprint sensor.
[1430.72 → 1431.74] That's really disappointing.
[1432.00 → 1432.94] Which is sort of a bummer
[1432.94 → 1433.44] because
[1433.44 → 1434.68] Apple's Touch
[1434.68 → 1435.70] recognition
[1435.70 → 1436.16] is
[1437.06 → 1438.12] awesome.
[1438.28 → 1438.42] Sorry,
[1438.54 → 1439.32] that only didn't go
[1439.32 → 1440.54] because I hadn't clicked it yet.
[1440.98 → 1441.22] Like,
[1441.26 → 1442.72] it's so fast.
[1442.72 → 1446.18] I would really miss that.
[1447.90 → 1448.22] You know,
[1448.42 → 1449.68] and I would look at something
[1449.68 → 1450.16] like that
[1450.16 → 1450.80] and I would go
[1450.80 → 1452.58] the decision between
[1452.58 → 1454.36] an iPhone 6S
[1454.36 → 1456.34] Because your form of power user
[1456.34 → 1457.28] is mostly speed.
[1457.46 → 1457.84] Am I correct?
[1457.98 → 1458.22] Yes.
[1458.46 → 1459.12] I'm all about
[1459.12 → 1460.32] getting stuff done
[1460.32 → 1461.12] with my finger shield.
[1461.12 → 1461.86] So you are absolutely
[1461.86 → 1463.08] a power user of your phone
[1463.08 → 1463.86] but like
[1463.86 → 1465.08] I don't do much with it.
[1465.08 → 1465.94] not in terms of like
[1465.94 → 1466.40] gaming
[1466.40 → 1467.50] or like
[1467.50 → 1468.86] watching really high
[1468.86 → 1469.94] quality video.
[1469.94 → 1471.32] No,
[1471.50 → 1471.70] I mean
[1471.70 → 1471.92] Speed.
[1472.32 → 1472.64] Yes.
[1473.00 → 1473.96] I expect performance
[1473.96 → 1474.58] and it's one thing
[1474.58 → 1475.06] that the iPhone
[1475.06 → 1475.88] does really well
[1475.88 → 1477.22] but the thing is
[1477.22 → 1478.20] is that the iPhone 7
[1478.20 → 1479.32] and the 6S
[1479.32 → 1479.96] for that matter
[1479.96 → 1481.06] are both
[1481.06 → 1481.92] really fast
[1481.92 → 1483.64] and the weird thing
[1483.64 → 1484.98] that an iPhone 8
[1484.98 → 1486.26] with this gorgeous
[1486.26 → 1488.44] full coverage display
[1488.44 → 1490.76] but lack of Touch ID
[1490.76 → 1493.06] does for me
[1493.06 → 1493.68] is it creates
[1493.68 → 1494.90] this weird segmentation
[1494.90 → 1495.88] in Apple's product lineup.
[1496.02 → 1496.06] Like,
[1496.12 → 1497.20] they tend to still support
[1497.20 → 1498.16] older iPhone models
[1498.16 → 1499.30] so I'm looking at it
[1499.30 → 1499.48] going,
[1499.60 → 1499.76] okay,
[1499.76 → 1501.44] so it's iPhone 6S
[1501.44 → 1502.66] if you want a headphone jack.
[1503.64 → 1504.92] It's iPhone 7
[1504.92 → 1505.76] if you want
[1505.76 → 1507.70] better battery life
[1507.70 → 1508.80] and better performance
[1508.80 → 1510.06] than the 6S
[1510.06 → 1512.26] but you don't care
[1512.26 → 1513.18] about the headphone jack
[1513.18 → 1514.28] and then it's the iPhone 8
[1514.28 → 1515.10] if you want this
[1515.10 → 1516.24] cool display experience
[1516.24 → 1517.12] but you're giving up
[1517.12 → 1518.04] both the headphone jack
[1518.04 → 1518.84] and Touch ID.
[1519.12 → 1519.92] And it costs more.
[1520.06 → 1520.88] And it costs more.
[1522.34 → 1523.34] And instead of it
[1523.34 → 1523.96] just being like
[1523.96 → 1525.64] an unequivocally
[1525.64 → 1526.96] better experience
[1526.96 → 1528.00] as you move up the stack
[1528.00 → 1528.72] There are trade-offs.
[1528.72 → 1529.48] You are actually
[1529.48 → 1530.24] making trade-offs
[1530.24 → 1530.78] as you go.
[1531.38 → 1532.50] Which is really...
[1532.50 → 1533.24] I feel like that would be
[1533.24 → 1534.72] unacceptable to Steve Jobs.
[1535.60 → 1536.26] It's hard.
[1536.90 → 1537.86] Let me try to think.
[1537.88 → 1538.36] Unless they like
[1538.36 → 1540.38] basically reinvented the wheel
[1540.38 → 1542.32] then he'd be like
[1542.32 → 1542.72] no,
[1542.86 → 1544.34] this is what the experience is now.
[1545.50 → 1546.66] And it would be a big deal.
[1546.66 → 1549.12] Did they ever take back
[1549.12 → 1549.68] a feature
[1549.68 → 1551.44] on a previous iPhone?
[1551.76 → 1552.62] Put together pieces
[1552.62 → 1553.42] from other things
[1553.42 → 1553.74] and went
[1553.74 → 1553.96] look,
[1554.04 → 1554.58] this is better.
[1558.06 → 1559.24] Steal the wheel.
[1559.62 → 1559.82] Yeah.
[1560.76 → 1561.78] They stole the wheel
[1561.78 → 1562.28] and then they put
[1562.28 → 1563.10] other spokes on it
[1563.10 → 1563.48] and they were like
[1563.48 → 1564.04] heck yeah.
[1566.66 → 1567.42] Trendy ones.
[1567.80 → 1568.00] Yeah.
[1568.24 → 1569.38] Really trendy wheels.
[1569.72 → 1570.54] Really trendy spokes.
[1570.70 → 1570.84] Sorry.
[1570.96 → 1571.50] The wheels were
[1571.50 → 1572.42] made by someone else.
[1572.42 → 1573.78] Okay.
[1574.50 → 1576.20] Speaking of taking features
[1576.20 → 1577.30] off the iPhone
[1577.30 → 1579.72] and or putting them back on,
[1580.28 → 1582.28] this is a pretty cool video.
[1582.56 → 1583.76] It's from Strange Parts.
[1583.84 → 1585.20] Guys only ever published
[1585.20 → 1586.58] two videos.
[1586.78 → 1587.06] Ever.
[1587.64 → 1588.58] One was the one
[1588.58 → 1589.58] Luke was talking about.
[1589.82 → 1590.00] Yeah.
[1590.16 → 1590.90] So the first one
[1590.90 → 1592.92] is how I made my own iPhone
[1592.92 → 1594.82] and it's 23 and a half minutes long.
[1594.92 → 1595.60] And then this one
[1595.60 → 1596.50] is bringing back
[1596.50 → 1597.82] the iPhone headphone jack
[1597.82 → 1600.40] and it's 33 and a half minutes long.
[1600.40 → 1601.30] And both of them
[1601.30 → 1602.28] are fascinating.
[1602.44 → 1603.36] I haven't fully watched
[1603.36 → 1603.96] the new one yet
[1603.96 → 1604.60] but the first one
[1604.60 → 1605.92] I have watched the entire thing.
[1606.56 → 1607.72] It's a great video.
[1607.84 → 1608.38] He's only released
[1608.38 → 1609.02] two videos
[1609.02 → 1609.96] like Linus just said.
[1610.28 → 1610.74] His other ones
[1610.74 → 1611.54] from four months ago
[1611.54 → 1612.92] and has nine million views.
[1613.12 → 1613.74] His new one's
[1613.74 → 1615.02] from two days ago
[1615.02 → 1615.58] and already has
[1615.58 → 1617.38] 1.7 million views.
[1617.72 → 1618.54] This guy's awesome.
[1618.68 → 1619.44] I dropped the link
[1619.44 → 1620.06] in the chat
[1620.06 → 1621.42] but I'm pretty sure
[1621.42 → 1622.48] fair use allows us
[1622.48 → 1623.22] to show a little bit
[1623.22 → 1623.80] of his video
[1623.80 → 1625.72] for the sake of
[1625.72 → 1626.24] illustrating
[1626.24 → 1627.28] that he made a video.
[1627.92 → 1628.52] So basically
[1628.52 → 1629.54] he does a bunch of stuff
[1629.54 → 1630.48] to the iPhone 7
[1630.48 → 1631.42] that he says he loves
[1631.42 → 1632.00] but it didn't have
[1632.00 → 1632.88] a headphone jack.
[1633.46 → 1634.88] Finds some contacts.
[1635.02 → 1635.94] Basically does some
[1635.94 → 1637.20] pretty crazy
[1637.20 → 1639.16] DIY ship
[1639.16 → 1640.12] my friends.
[1643.66 → 1644.18] Wow.
[1644.38 → 1644.90] So basically
[1644.90 → 1646.52] he ripped off
[1646.52 → 1648.14] how the lightning adapter works
[1648.14 → 1648.96] and then like
[1648.96 → 1651.82] that's incredible.
[1652.04 → 1652.52] It's wild.
[1652.70 → 1653.60] Like even the
[1653.60 → 1654.48] how I made my own
[1654.48 → 1655.20] iPhone video
[1655.20 → 1656.46] is absolutely wild.
[1656.58 → 1657.54] Like how he finds
[1657.54 → 1658.22] all the different things
[1658.22 → 1658.92] and how he talks
[1658.92 → 1659.56] to different people
[1659.56 → 1660.78] to get information
[1660.78 → 1663.28] to find out like
[1663.28 → 1664.74] oh I needed these
[1664.74 → 1665.86] little tiny
[1665.86 → 1667.70] like silver contact pads
[1667.70 → 1668.24] that have to go
[1668.24 → 1668.84] in this one area
[1668.84 → 1669.54] that like aren't
[1669.54 → 1670.42] detailed anywhere
[1670.42 → 1671.76] but they have to go there
[1671.76 → 1672.36] so that there's like
[1672.36 → 1673.78] spacing between whatever
[1673.78 → 1675.34] and like he details
[1675.34 → 1676.72] all of his different talks
[1676.72 → 1677.52] with different people
[1677.52 → 1678.22] and he details
[1678.22 → 1678.98] everything that he's doing
[1678.98 → 1679.70] and I don't know
[1679.70 → 1680.34] about this one
[1680.34 → 1680.94] but how I made
[1680.94 → 1681.70] my own iPhone video
[1681.70 → 1682.44] went over as far
[1682.44 → 1683.40] as I know months.
[1683.90 → 1683.96] Right.
[1684.04 → 1684.68] He's like doing
[1684.68 → 1686.04] little pickup vlog
[1686.04 → 1686.94] things the whole time.
[1687.04 → 1687.72] It's really cool.
[1688.10 → 1688.90] I haven't fully seen
[1688.90 → 1689.40] the new one yet.
[1689.48 → 1690.30] I would highly suggest
[1690.30 → 1691.02] watching both.
[1691.30 → 1691.50] Yeah.
[1691.68 → 1692.90] Go check it out you guys.
[1693.48 → 1694.06] Channel name is
[1694.06 → 1695.04] Strange Parts.
[1696.62 → 1698.04] And we've got one more
[1698.04 → 1698.94] let's do one more topic
[1698.94 → 1699.88] before we jump
[1699.88 → 1700.62] into our sponsors.
[1701.38 → 1702.40] This source is
[1702.40 → 1703.84] WCCF Tech
[1703.84 → 1705.02] so take it with a grain
[1705.02 → 1707.14] of salt.
[1710.14 → 1712.82] AMD Vega 11 GPUs
[1712.82 → 1714.60] supposedly entering
[1714.60 → 1715.26] production
[1715.26 → 1717.12] with Vega 20
[1717.12 → 1718.32] rumoured to be coming
[1718.32 → 1720.52] on 7 nanometers.
[1720.84 → 1722.22] So the AMD
[1722.22 → 1723.22] rumour mill
[1723.22 → 1725.88] is going strong.
[1726.56 → 1727.36] Vega 11
[1727.36 → 1728.64] will supposedly
[1728.64 → 1730.44] be an actual
[1730.44 → 1731.36] replacement
[1731.36 → 1732.90] for Polaris 10
[1732.90 → 1734.32] slash 20
[1734.32 → 1735.44] in the RX 580
[1735.44 → 1736.16] and 570
[1736.16 → 1736.94] graphics cards.
[1737.10 → 1737.60] It's rumoured
[1737.60 → 1738.02] to feature
[1738.02 → 1739.00] HBM2 memory
[1739.00 → 1740.98] which I would
[1740.98 → 1742.48] assume AMD
[1742.48 → 1743.38] has some
[1743.38 → 1744.46] compelling reason
[1744.46 → 1744.84] for.
[1745.54 → 1745.68] Yeah.
[1747.28 → 1748.30] Given that
[1748.30 → 1748.76] they're
[1748.76 → 1749.90] again this is a rumour
[1749.90 → 1751.02] but given that
[1751.02 → 1751.52] they're rumoured
[1751.52 → 1752.82] to be losing money
[1752.82 → 1753.84] on RX Vega
[1753.84 → 1754.42] right now
[1754.42 → 1755.24] due to the cost
[1755.24 → 1756.12] of HBM2
[1756.12 → 1757.60] given that
[1757.60 → 1758.58] I would be
[1758.58 → 1759.42] floored
[1759.42 → 1760.42] if HBM2
[1760.42 → 1761.74] is cheaper
[1761.74 → 1762.88] than
[1762.88 → 1763.48] some
[1763.48 → 1764.26] DDR
[1764.26 → 1764.86] variant
[1764.86 → 1767.70] and given
[1767.70 → 1768.26] that
[1768.26 → 1768.98] like even
[1768.98 → 1769.62] once
[1769.62 → 1771.04] I believe
[1771.04 → 1771.46] it's SK
[1771.46 → 1771.82] Unix
[1771.82 → 1772.14] that they're
[1772.14 → 1772.60] waiting to
[1772.60 → 1773.54] come online
[1773.54 → 1773.94] so that
[1773.94 → 1774.40] pricing will
[1774.40 → 1774.70] get more
[1774.70 → 1775.10] competitive
[1775.10 → 1776.40] and
[1776.40 → 1777.76] like why
[1777.76 → 1778.14] would a
[1778.14 → 1778.54] mid-range
[1778.54 → 1779.12] card even
[1779.12 → 1779.60] need
[1779.60 → 1780.82] HBM2
[1780.82 → 1781.22] memory?
[1781.42 → 1782.02] Like HBM2
[1782.02 → 1782.58] is super
[1782.58 → 1782.96] cool
[1782.96 → 1783.22] but
[1783.22 → 1784.18] GTDR5
[1784.18 → 1785.08] is a
[1785.08 → 1786.38] very solid
[1786.38 → 1788.58] pretty damn
[1788.58 → 1789.40] well performing
[1789.40 → 1790.04] implementation.
[1790.20 → 1790.38] Like why
[1790.38 → 1790.86] don't I put it
[1790.86 → 1791.22] this way?
[1791.24 → 1791.88] It's not very
[1791.88 → 1792.20] expensive.
[1792.44 → 1792.68] If
[1792.68 → 1794.04] GDDR5
[1794.04 → 1795.06] is good enough
[1795.06 → 1795.70] for the
[1795.70 → 1796.24] GTX
[1796.24 → 1797.02] 1080 Ti
[1797.02 → 1799.52] and your
[1799.52 → 1800.06] upcoming
[1800.06 → 1801.90] mid-range
[1801.90 → 1802.28] Vega
[1802.28 → 1803.62] is not
[1803.62 → 1804.40] faster than
[1804.40 → 1805.18] a 1080 Ti
[1805.18 → 1807.58] why do
[1807.58 → 1808.26] you need
[1808.26 → 1809.86] HBM2?
[1810.12 → 1810.58] I don't think
[1810.58 → 1811.88] it's that
[1811.88 → 1812.64] big of like
[1812.64 → 1813.82] a buzzword.
[1814.32 → 1814.94] I know
[1814.94 → 1815.72] and that's a funny
[1815.72 → 1815.82] thing.
[1815.82 → 1816.10] Most people don't
[1816.10 → 1816.52] know what it
[1816.52 → 1816.94] means.
[1817.10 → 1817.70] Like AMD
[1817.70 → 1818.56] every time I
[1818.56 → 1819.26] talk to them
[1819.26 → 1820.66] they are just
[1820.66 → 1821.66] like they
[1821.66 → 1823.10] can't wait
[1823.10 → 1824.08] to like
[1824.08 → 1825.32] unzip
[1825.32 → 1826.10] and like
[1826.10 → 1826.58] show me
[1826.58 → 1827.66] their HBM2
[1827.66 → 1828.72] and be like
[1828.72 → 1829.48] we are bringing
[1829.48 → 1830.44] HBM2 to
[1830.44 → 1830.92] consumers
[1830.92 → 1831.84] and I'm
[1831.84 → 1832.22] sitting here
[1832.22 → 1832.56] going
[1832.56 → 1834.02] so what?
[1835.30 → 1835.78] Consumers
[1835.78 → 1836.68] don't
[1836.68 → 1837.38] care
[1837.38 → 1838.74] what memory
[1838.74 → 1839.20] is under
[1839.20 → 1839.70] the hood.
[1840.00 → 1840.34] I just want to
[1840.34 → 1840.88] know how fast
[1840.88 → 1841.26] it is in
[1841.26 → 1841.82] whatever game
[1841.82 → 1841.90] it is.
[1841.90 → 1842.20] Yeah there
[1842.20 → 1842.70] are a few
[1842.70 → 1843.24] that do
[1843.24 → 1843.62] sure
[1843.62 → 1844.46] but they
[1844.46 → 1845.68] care about
[1845.68 → 1846.34] the 0 to
[1846.34 → 1846.68] 60
[1846.68 → 1848.74] of the
[1848.74 → 1849.18] vehicle
[1849.18 → 1849.96] and like
[1849.96 → 1850.48] if it has
[1850.48 → 1851.08] air conditioning
[1851.08 → 1851.56] and stuff.
[1851.78 → 1852.22] No idea
[1852.22 → 1852.92] what HBM2
[1852.92 → 1853.20] is.
[1853.72 → 1854.20] Well yeah
[1854.20 → 1855.58] it's a next
[1855.58 → 1856.14] generation
[1856.14 → 1856.78] graphics memory.
[1856.78 → 1857.34] We've made
[1857.34 → 1858.24] videos on it.
[1859.60 → 1859.94] I'm not
[1859.94 → 1860.46] insulting you
[1860.46 → 1860.96] I'm just saying
[1860.96 → 1861.58] like this is a
[1861.58 → 1861.70] thing.
[1861.72 → 1862.44] The only thing
[1862.44 → 1863.02] I can think
[1863.02 → 1863.68] of is if
[1863.68 → 1864.20] they think
[1864.20 → 1864.58] that it's
[1864.58 → 1865.02] going to
[1865.02 → 1866.14] reduce the
[1866.14 → 1866.74] complexity
[1866.74 → 1867.40] and therefore
[1867.40 → 1868.20] the cost
[1868.20 → 1868.74] of the
[1868.74 → 1870.00] graphics card
[1870.00 → 1870.58] PCB
[1870.58 → 1871.66] to such an
[1871.66 → 1872.18] extent that
[1872.18 → 1872.42] it will
[1872.42 → 1873.46] offset the
[1873.46 → 1874.22] additional cost
[1874.22 → 1874.48] of the
[1874.48 → 1874.78] memory
[1874.78 → 1876.48] or if
[1876.48 → 1877.20] they basically
[1877.20 → 1877.96] the other
[1877.96 → 1878.48] thing that I
[1878.48 → 1878.90] can think
[1878.90 → 1879.40] of is that
[1879.40 → 1879.90] they just
[1879.90 → 1880.48] locked
[1880.48 → 1880.96] themselves
[1880.96 → 1881.94] into this
[1881.94 → 1883.38] 18 months
[1883.38 → 1883.90] ago when
[1883.90 → 1884.30] development
[1884.30 → 1884.94] started and
[1884.94 → 1885.28] there's no
[1885.28 → 1885.76] going back
[1885.76 → 1887.30] now without
[1887.30 → 1889.06] significant R&D
[1889.06 → 1890.18] to backtrack
[1890.18 → 1890.46] on the
[1890.46 → 1891.04] decision and
[1891.04 → 1891.40] they're just
[1891.40 → 1891.86] kind of
[1891.86 → 1893.12] boned because
[1893.12 → 1894.30] HBM2 costs
[1894.30 → 1895.40] didn't fall
[1895.40 → 1895.80] the way that
[1895.80 → 1896.02] they were
[1896.02 → 1896.34] hoping.
[1896.90 → 1897.46] Actually you
[1897.46 → 1897.68] know what
[1897.68 → 1898.14] that's probably
[1898.14 → 1898.38] it.
[1903.50 → 1904.06] Okay.
[1904.88 → 1905.62] In other
[1905.62 → 1905.96] news.
[1906.82 → 1907.10] Sorry?
[1907.34 → 1907.66] Sponsors.
[1907.74 → 1908.16] Yeah yeah I
[1908.16 → 1908.30] will.
[1908.84 → 1909.70] AMD's next
[1909.70 → 1910.62] generation high
[1910.62 → 1911.76] in Vega 20
[1911.76 → 1912.72] AI and
[1912.72 → 1913.56] super computing
[1913.56 → 1914.16] general purpose
[1914.16 → 1914.80] graphics chips
[1914.80 → 1915.60] will allegedly
[1915.60 → 1916.06] be made at
[1916.06 → 1917.36] TSMC in
[1917.36 → 1917.84] order to take
[1917.84 → 1918.38] advantage of
[1918.38 → 1919.34] their 7 nanometre
[1919.34 → 1920.40] process technology
[1920.40 → 1921.30] which is expected
[1921.30 → 1922.56] to enter volume
[1922.56 → 1923.40] production sometime
[1923.40 → 1923.94] next year.
[1924.00 → 1924.68] So this is all
[1924.68 → 1926.84] very early
[1926.84 → 1927.64] rumour stuff
[1927.64 → 1928.30] where basically
[1928.30 → 1929.20] it feels like
[1929.20 → 1930.22] AMD's in sort
[1930.22 → 1930.46] of.
[1931.46 → 1932.46] They're basically
[1932.46 → 1933.62] letting us know
[1933.62 → 1934.92] that there will
[1934.92 → 1936.30] definitely be news
[1936.30 → 1937.00] for WAN show
[1937.00 → 1938.04] about AMD all
[1938.04 → 1938.60] the way through
[1938.60 → 1939.14] the end of this
[1939.14 → 1939.94] year and into
[1939.94 → 1940.92] the next year.
[1942.32 → 1943.06] Thank you.
[1943.24 → 1943.80] I appreciate
[1943.80 → 1944.20] that.
[1944.26 → 1945.12] Thank you, AMD.
[1945.42 → 1945.88] We appreciate
[1945.88 → 1947.90] the steady
[1947.90 → 1948.82] stream of
[1948.82 → 1949.16] leaks.
[1951.34 → 1952.28] It's appreciated.
[1952.54 → 1953.08] We have to talk
[1953.08 → 1953.56] about something.
[1954.16 → 1955.02] So it might as
[1955.02 → 1956.54] well be products
[1956.54 → 1957.98] that AMD hasn't
[1957.98 → 1958.64] made yet but
[1958.64 → 1960.00] they're going to
[1960.00 → 1961.16] and it's gonna
[1961.16 → 1961.74] be perfect.
[1962.24 → 1962.98] I mean honestly
[1962.98 → 1963.84] I don't know
[1963.84 → 1964.84] how much of what
[1964.84 → 1965.52] leaks out of AMD
[1965.52 → 1966.44] is unintentional
[1966.44 → 1967.28] and how much of
[1967.28 → 1968.34] it is like oh
[1968.34 → 1970.38] RX Vega is sort
[1970.38 → 1970.90] of not that
[1970.90 → 1972.54] exciting especially
[1972.54 → 1974.54] because GPU
[1974.54 → 1975.28] pricing is
[1975.28 → 1975.96] screwed right
[1975.96 → 1976.28] now.
[1978.08 → 1978.86] But we need
[1978.86 → 1979.42] headlines.
[1981.42 → 1982.14] Hey what are
[1982.14 → 1982.76] you working on?
[1985.20 → 1986.16] Hey Jeff!
[1986.50 → 1986.98] Jeff!
[1988.56 → 1989.26] What's on your
[1989.26 → 1989.62] screen?
[1990.60 → 1991.12] Okay cool.
[1991.32 → 1991.70] Cool man.
[1991.78 → 1992.34] Don't worry about
[1992.34 → 1992.50] it.
[1992.50 → 1992.70] Yeah.
[1992.70 → 1998.70] All right.
[1998.94 → 1999.82] Sponsors for the
[1999.82 → 2000.36] show.
[2000.68 → 2001.42] First up is
[2001.42 → 2002.18] FreshBooks.
[2002.68 → 2003.58] So let's say
[2003.58 → 2004.40] you're not in the
[2004.40 → 2005.58] business of leaking
[2005.58 → 2006.46] AMD news.
[2006.60 → 2006.92] You're in the
[2006.92 → 2008.20] business of fixing
[2008.20 → 2010.12] AMD computers or
[2010.12 → 2011.18] Intel ones as it
[2011.18 → 2011.52] were.
[2011.82 → 2012.54] You run a small
[2012.54 → 2013.52] time tech shop.
[2013.62 → 2014.24] You run a plumbing
[2014.24 → 2014.70] business.
[2014.86 → 2015.76] You teach yoga in
[2015.76 → 2016.28] your garage.
[2016.36 → 2016.94] Whatever it is you
[2016.94 → 2017.18] do.
[2017.18 → 2018.06] If you're a small
[2018.06 → 2018.92] business owner and
[2018.92 → 2019.68] you're looking for an
[2019.68 → 2020.48] accounting solution
[2020.48 → 2022.02] this is great.
[2022.02 → 2023.64] I even said this
[2023.64 → 2024.22] recently.
[2024.84 → 2026.24] FreshBooks is one
[2026.24 → 2027.36] of the only sponsors
[2027.36 → 2028.24] we've ever had that
[2028.24 → 2029.68] has literally generated
[2029.68 → 2031.12] zero complaints back
[2031.12 → 2031.56] to us.
[2032.06 → 2032.68] Literally zero.
[2032.68 → 2033.76] I even challenged
[2033.76 → 2035.58] people to complain
[2035.58 → 2037.32] and we didn't get a
[2037.32 → 2038.66] single complaint let
[2038.66 → 2039.42] alone one that we
[2039.42 → 2040.40] could validate back
[2040.40 → 2041.16] to somebody who
[2041.16 → 2042.36] actually used it.
[2044.14 → 2045.16] FreshBooks man.
[2045.60 → 2046.08] That's cool.
[2046.08 → 2046.90] It lets you track
[2046.90 → 2047.74] your time with the
[2047.74 → 2048.66] timesheet function,
[2048.96 → 2049.92] manage your expenses,
[2050.28 → 2051.00] it helps you keep
[2051.00 → 2051.92] track of who owes
[2051.92 → 2052.42] you what.
[2052.74 → 2053.36] It has a feature
[2053.36 → 2054.76] that tells you when
[2054.76 → 2055.68] a client looks at an
[2055.68 → 2056.54] invoice for the first
[2056.54 → 2056.88] time.
[2057.22 → 2057.92] It has the full
[2057.92 → 2058.96] functionality in the
[2058.96 → 2060.36] mobile app for iOS
[2060.36 → 2061.74] and Android so you
[2061.74 → 2062.44] don't even have to sit
[2062.44 → 2063.14] down at your computer
[2063.14 → 2064.56] to work on it and you
[2064.56 → 2066.92] can even call and talk
[2066.92 → 2068.02] to someone immediately
[2068.02 → 2068.68] if you're having
[2068.68 → 2069.10] trouble.
[2069.72 → 2070.92] Just no phone trees,
[2071.04 → 2072.64] no escalations, no
[2072.64 → 2074.14] return calls, just
[2074.14 → 2074.58] answers.
[2074.92 → 2075.70] Try it out for 30
[2075.70 → 2076.62] days for free at
[2076.62 → 2077.76] freshbooks.com slash
[2077.76 → 2079.32] WAN and enter the WAN
[2079.32 → 2080.74] show in how you
[2080.74 → 2081.56] heard about us
[2081.56 → 2082.00] section.
[2082.78 → 2084.46] Number two is
[2084.46 → 2085.10] Corsair.
[2085.58 → 2085.82] Oh.
[2085.90 → 2086.06] Oh.
[2086.52 → 2086.82] Wow.
[2086.92 → 2087.80] I don't think Corsair
[2087.80 → 2088.70] has sponsored the WAN
[2088.70 → 2089.58] show in forever.
[2089.94 → 2090.96] So they refreshed
[2090.96 → 2092.28] their Void series of
[2092.28 → 2093.58] gaming headsets.
[2093.66 → 2094.18] They now have the
[2094.18 → 2094.56] Void Pro.
[2094.62 → 2095.44] Where are my keys?
[2098.12 → 2098.82] Do you have a knife
[2098.82 → 2099.12] on you?
[2099.32 → 2099.56] No.
[2099.66 → 2100.34] Oh, I apparently
[2100.34 → 2101.42] have side cutters in
[2101.42 → 2102.20] my pocket, so don't
[2102.20 → 2102.36] worry.
[2102.46 → 2103.06] I got this, bro.
[2103.06 → 2105.14] I didn't get to show
[2105.14 → 2106.00] off my super cool
[2106.00 → 2106.82] valve lanyard.
[2107.10 → 2107.78] Well, you can if you
[2107.78 → 2108.02] want.
[2108.40 → 2109.58] Super cool valve
[2109.58 → 2110.08] lanyard.
[2110.58 → 2110.82] Yeah.
[2110.82 → 2111.74] With a Stormtrooper
[2111.74 → 2112.14] on it.
[2112.14 → 2112.82] With a Stormtrooper
[2112.82 → 2113.08] on it.
[2113.26 → 2114.60] Whose feet are
[2114.60 → 2115.18] lights.
[2115.82 → 2116.46] You can't really see
[2116.46 → 2116.86] that on the camera.
[2117.04 → 2117.70] And they can move
[2117.70 → 2118.30] independently.
[2118.78 → 2119.38] So you can actually
[2119.38 → 2120.12] light up two different
[2120.12 → 2120.88] places at once.
[2121.44 → 2121.92] Heck yeah.
[2121.98 → 2122.86] You're such a dork and
[2122.86 → 2123.54] it's why I love you.
[2123.54 → 2123.80] Yeah.
[2126.74 → 2128.34] So live unboxing of
[2128.34 → 2129.34] the Void Pro.
[2130.58 → 2130.78] Hit.
[2131.10 → 2131.60] Oh, okay.
[2131.74 → 2131.90] Fine.
[2132.52 → 2133.50] Hit me again.
[2133.60 → 2135.28] We got another seal.
[2135.66 → 2136.46] We need seal team
[2136.46 → 2136.74] Luke.
[2137.20 → 2137.64] Wow.
[2137.94 → 2138.32] That would be
[2138.32 → 2138.66] awesome.
[2138.76 → 2139.60] It's funny because
[2139.60 → 2140.28] seal.
[2140.68 → 2141.80] It's so bad that it
[2141.80 → 2142.58] just like pulled it
[2142.58 → 2142.88] off.
[2143.66 → 2144.10] Wow.
[2144.42 → 2145.84] I assumed you had a
[2145.84 → 2146.06] knife.
[2146.14 → 2146.74] You were just going to
[2146.74 → 2147.48] jam a key in it.
[2147.52 → 2147.70] Yeah.
[2148.26 → 2148.96] There you go.
[2149.06 → 2149.68] Thank you.
[2149.78 → 2150.34] Should work now.
[2151.02 → 2151.28] Yeah.
[2151.82 → 2152.72] You're Jacky, but
[2152.72 → 2153.06] it's fine.
[2156.40 → 2156.92] Alright.
[2156.92 → 2158.34] So what do we get
[2158.34 → 2158.96] in here?
[2159.48 → 2161.44] It's got microfiber.
[2162.04 → 2162.34] Okay.
[2162.44 → 2164.04] First, it is
[2164.04 → 2165.20] like pretty darn, it's
[2165.20 → 2165.78] secured in the
[2165.78 → 2166.82] packaging like a toy.
[2167.30 → 2168.06] It's not, it's not
[2168.06 → 2168.82] going to be, it's
[2168.82 → 2169.58] probably, it's very
[2169.58 → 2170.46] unlikely that it will
[2170.46 → 2171.30] be broken in the box.
[2171.42 → 2171.78] Yes.
[2172.24 → 2172.74] It is like.
[2172.76 → 2173.38] Because it's going to
[2173.38 → 2174.80] stay exactly where it
[2174.80 → 2174.92] is.
[2174.92 → 2177.22] It is seat belted AF in
[2177.22 → 2177.46] there.
[2177.54 → 2177.84] Oh yeah.
[2178.04 → 2179.38] So at least it's
[2179.38 → 2180.12] got that, you know
[2180.12 → 2180.36] what?
[2180.64 → 2182.32] It, it, it might not
[2182.32 → 2183.84] even, you know, work,
[2184.10 → 2185.52] but it's going to look
[2185.52 → 2186.20] amazing.
[2186.20 → 2187.28] No dents, no
[2187.28 → 2187.74] scratches.
[2188.24 → 2188.92] It'll probably work.
[2188.96 → 2189.42] I'm just kidding.
[2189.48 → 2190.24] It'll probably work.
[2190.26 → 2190.80] It's a pretty damn
[2190.80 → 2191.54] good chance that it'll
[2191.54 → 2191.74] work.
[2193.60 → 2194.24] Of course, there
[2194.24 → 2194.88] should bring us to
[2194.88 → 2196.18] their manufacturing.
[2196.62 → 2197.36] I can't, I can't
[2197.36 → 2199.24] get this plastic off.
[2199.82 → 2201.22] I don't have a knife.
[2201.72 → 2202.10] Fine.
[2202.14 → 2202.78] I'm just going to do
[2202.78 → 2203.40] the features.
[2204.32 → 2204.72] Okay.
[2205.64 → 2206.96] So they've got, oh.
[2207.24 → 2207.38] Yeah.
[2207.38 → 2207.98] They tuck it in there.
[2208.08 → 2208.82] Oh, that's a cool
[2208.82 → 2210.36] place to stash the, uh,
[2210.68 → 2211.72] the USB adapter,
[2211.88 → 2212.96] sound card adapter thing.
[2212.96 → 2214.40] This is a perfect
[2214.40 → 2215.96] way to do USB headsets.
[2216.16 → 2218.32] I was actually super mad
[2218.32 → 2219.64] at some of the earlier
[2219.64 → 2220.78] Corsair headsets that
[2220.78 → 2222.28] just had the USB connector
[2222.28 → 2223.24] right on the cable.
[2223.38 → 2223.56] Yeah.
[2223.62 → 2225.30] Because this is so much
[2225.30 → 2225.90] more versatile.
[2225.90 → 2227.64] So it comes with a
[2227.64 → 2229.26] Dolby headphone certified
[2229.26 → 2230.52] USB sound card.
[2230.68 → 2232.42] That way you could carry
[2232.42 → 2233.24] this in your bag.
[2233.30 → 2233.70] You could keep it
[2233.70 → 2234.86] somewhere safe just in
[2234.86 → 2235.78] case it is like came
[2235.78 → 2237.16] unplugged and fell off
[2237.16 → 2237.54] or whatever.
[2237.54 → 2238.48] So it's easier to
[2238.48 → 2239.92] cart around, and it's
[2239.92 → 2240.50] really flexible.
[2240.50 → 2241.88] Like let's say Corsair
[2241.88 → 2242.52] came up with a new
[2242.52 → 2243.18] headset, and you wanted
[2243.18 → 2244.28] to get something
[2244.28 → 2245.36] newer and shinier.
[2245.82 → 2247.06] But maybe it didn't
[2247.06 → 2247.82] come with a dongle
[2247.82 → 2248.66] for whatever reason.
[2248.74 → 2249.42] You could continue
[2249.42 → 2250.24] to carry this forward
[2250.24 → 2251.12] which I really like.
[2252.60 → 2253.82] It's got microfiber
[2253.82 → 2254.40] ear cups,
[2255.48 → 2256.18] 50 millimetre
[2256.18 → 2257.04] neodymium speaker
[2257.04 → 2258.32] drivers with Dolby
[2258.32 → 2258.96] headphone as I
[2258.96 → 2259.58] mentioned before.
[2259.74 → 2260.42] A unidirectional
[2260.42 → 2261.14] microphone that
[2261.14 → 2262.04] cancels ambient noise
[2262.04 → 2262.70] so you can talk
[2262.70 → 2263.70] strategically with
[2263.70 → 2264.10] clarity.
[2264.44 → 2264.94] That's a great
[2264.94 → 2265.84] talking point you guys.
[2266.16 → 2266.70] So they've got the
[2266.70 → 2267.44] Void Pro Special
[2267.44 → 2268.86] Edition, Wireless,
[2269.42 → 2270.62] USB, and Surround
[2270.62 → 2270.92] Version.
[2271.06 → 2272.06] Check them out now
[2272.06 → 2273.26] through Amazon or
[2273.26 → 2274.48] New egg at the links
[2274.48 → 2275.34] under the video
[2275.34 → 2276.70] slash in the Twitch
[2276.70 → 2277.54] chat which I will
[2277.54 → 2278.80] post right now.
[2278.86 → 2279.26] I'm going to post
[2279.26 → 2280.30] the Amazon one.
[2281.24 → 2281.64] You know what?
[2281.72 → 2283.06] I think our commission
[2283.06 → 2284.44] is higher from New egg
[2284.44 → 2285.92] but if people buy
[2285.92 → 2287.32] other unrelated crap
[2287.32 → 2288.60] on Amazon then we
[2288.60 → 2290.44] also get a commission
[2290.44 → 2290.90] for that.
[2290.98 → 2291.46] So I don't know
[2291.46 → 2292.16] which one is better.
[2292.26 → 2293.32] I will post them both.
[2294.46 → 2295.22] So if you're going to
[2295.22 → 2295.62] buy...
[2295.62 → 2295.98] There you go.
[2296.04 → 2296.48] If you guys want to
[2296.48 → 2297.20] check out the Void Pro
[2297.20 → 2297.82] you can do that.
[2298.14 → 2299.86] Leading us to our
[2299.86 → 2301.64] least safe for work
[2301.64 → 2303.12] sponsor spot.
[2303.84 → 2304.56] Oh, oh.
[2304.56 → 2305.10] You've got to be
[2305.10 → 2305.54] strategic.
[2305.76 → 2306.44] No, I got this.
[2306.64 → 2306.78] Here.
[2307.12 → 2307.80] I'm going to...
[2307.80 → 2308.40] Oh, yeah.
[2308.58 → 2308.76] Yeah.
[2308.84 → 2309.06] Okay.
[2309.18 → 2309.40] Okay.
[2309.76 → 2310.00] Okay.
[2310.16 → 2310.56] Hold on.
[2310.92 → 2312.26] Let me get the shirt
[2312.26 → 2312.52] ready.
[2312.92 → 2313.18] Okay.
[2313.30 → 2313.76] No slip.
[2313.88 → 2314.36] No slip.
[2315.32 → 2315.92] Hold on.
[2316.14 → 2316.60] Oh, wait.
[2316.80 → 2317.40] I've got to get
[2317.40 → 2318.38] Mack Weldon up here.
[2318.44 → 2319.02] Mack Weldon!
[2320.10 → 2320.62] Hold on.
[2320.78 → 2322.14] Just hold that thought.
[2322.34 → 2322.86] Hold that thought.
[2323.00 → 2323.76] I've always wanted to
[2323.76 → 2324.12] be a bra.
[2324.28 → 2325.50] I want to do all the...
[2325.50 → 2325.74] Wait.
[2325.74 → 2326.74] I'm confused.
[2327.08 → 2327.68] No, I get it.
[2327.72 → 2327.98] Okay.
[2328.18 → 2331.78] Mack Weldon believes in
[2331.78 → 2333.94] smart design, premium fabrics,
[2334.14 → 2335.12] and simple shopping.
[2336.04 → 2337.78] It's actually like super easy.
[2338.18 → 2339.60] And the clothes are super nice.
[2341.20 → 2342.66] Mack Weldon will be the most
[2342.66 → 2343.88] comfortable underwear, socks,
[2343.96 → 2345.34] shirts, undershirts, hoodies,
[2345.56 → 2345.78] and...
[2345.78 → 2346.88] If I had an undershirt,
[2347.06 → 2348.02] that would solve this problem.
[2348.02 → 2348.74] That would probably help.
[2348.74 → 2350.00] Undershirts and sweatpants
[2350.00 → 2350.62] you will ever wear.
[2350.82 → 2352.10] And this is like
[2352.10 → 2353.64] the best part
[2353.64 → 2354.78] for the...
[2354.78 → 2355.32] Oh, yeah.
[2355.40 → 2356.74] The stereotypical gamers
[2356.74 → 2357.26] out there.
[2357.26 → 2357.48] Done.
[2358.44 → 2360.00] Mack Weldon has a line
[2360.00 → 2362.32] of silver underwear
[2362.32 → 2362.94] and shirts.
[2363.12 → 2363.64] You know what the thumbnail
[2363.64 → 2364.12] is going to be now?
[2365.58 → 2366.28] Of course.
[2367.66 → 2368.62] Silver underwear
[2368.62 → 2369.16] and shirts,
[2369.40 → 2370.66] which are naturally
[2370.66 → 2371.64] antimicrobial.
[2371.72 → 2372.84] You can even use silver
[2372.84 → 2374.22] in your water cooling lube
[2374.22 → 2375.64] to keep junk from growing in it.
[2375.76 → 2377.10] That's how well silver works
[2377.10 → 2378.74] as an antimicrobial agent.
[2379.16 → 2381.90] And it just works forever, TM.
[2382.06 → 2383.44] I mean, nothing works forever.
[2383.84 → 2385.54] Eventually, everything turns to dust.
[2385.90 → 2387.70] But what happens is
[2387.70 → 2388.94] as you sweat
[2388.94 → 2390.36] or as you get kind of gross,
[2390.70 → 2391.60] the shirt itself
[2391.60 → 2392.98] can actually cancel out
[2392.98 → 2394.24] some of the microbial growth,
[2394.48 → 2395.28] which cancels out
[2395.28 → 2396.00] some of the smell,
[2396.00 → 2397.68] which is super freaking cool.
[2398.10 → 2398.74] Mack Weldon wants you
[2398.74 → 2399.20] to be comfortable,
[2399.44 → 2400.26] so if you don't like
[2400.26 → 2400.88] your first pair,
[2401.06 → 2401.76] you keep it
[2401.76 → 2403.18] and they will still refund you
[2403.18 → 2404.52] no questions asked.
[2405.00 → 2406.56] So go check them out
[2406.56 → 2407.88] at MackWeldon.com
[2407.88 → 2409.60] and get 20% off
[2409.60 → 2410.60] with offer code
[2410.60 → 2411.52] TECHNICS.
[2411.72 → 2411.94] Yeah.
[2413.12 → 2414.26] Oh, that was stressful.
[2414.54 → 2415.26] That was a little stressful.
[2415.26 → 2415.82] I was worried
[2415.82 → 2416.36] we were going to get
[2416.36 → 2417.46] banned from Twitch, man.
[2417.56 → 2418.18] Yeah, me too.
[2419.34 → 2420.94] Intel has discontinued
[2420.94 → 2422.76] the Core i7 6700K
[2422.76 → 2424.48] and 6600K.
[2424.56 → 2425.00] Yeah, we'll do it
[2425.00 → 2425.54] at the end, I guess.
[2426.00 → 2427.12] This was posted by
[2427.12 → 2428.56] Zeno's Tech on the forum
[2428.56 → 2429.50] and the original article
[2429.50 → 2431.18] is from the Tech Report.
[2431.84 → 2432.62] I mean, there's no real
[2432.62 → 2433.40] surprises here.
[2433.60 → 2434.62] The rumours are
[2434.62 → 2435.48] that Coffee Lake
[2435.48 → 2437.24] is coming very soon.
[2437.70 → 2439.24] Intel rarely keeps
[2439.24 → 2440.46] a last generation product
[2440.46 → 2441.30] alive for long
[2441.30 → 2441.98] after they launch
[2441.98 → 2442.44] a new one,
[2442.92 → 2444.20] especially because
[2444.20 → 2446.44] they don't generally
[2446.44 → 2447.14] drop the price
[2447.14 → 2448.16] of the last generation one
[2448.16 → 2449.00] because it's not really
[2449.00 → 2449.92] any cheaper to make.
[2450.12 → 2450.92] Or it's not so much that
[2450.92 → 2452.54] as it is that the new one
[2452.54 → 2453.22] isn't really any more
[2453.22 → 2453.98] expensive to make,
[2454.12 → 2455.52] so they're just like,
[2455.60 → 2456.54] well, you might as well
[2456.54 → 2457.66] buy the new one, I guess.
[2457.66 → 2459.80] I mean,
[2460.50 → 2462.00] It's not like CPUs
[2462.00 → 2462.64] really break,
[2462.76 → 2463.70] so if you still want one,
[2463.78 → 2465.14] I'm sure you can buy one online.
[2465.16 → 2466.12] Yeah, and the 7700K
[2466.12 → 2467.50] even works in the same boards,
[2467.64 → 2468.24] so it's like,
[2469.22 → 2470.26] there's like really
[2470.26 → 2471.38] not much of a reason
[2471.38 → 2472.44] to run out and buy these
[2472.44 → 2473.98] unless you get one
[2473.98 → 2475.02] on promo or something,
[2475.18 → 2476.14] but that tends to be
[2476.14 → 2477.04] pretty rare just because
[2477.04 → 2478.28] of the way that Intel
[2478.28 → 2479.40] manages their supply chain
[2479.40 → 2480.10] really well.
[2480.24 → 2481.00] Like, speaking as someone
[2481.00 → 2482.82] who came from the channel,
[2482.82 → 2485.16] it tends to be
[2485.16 → 2486.04] that just kind of,
[2486.56 → 2487.44] they must just have
[2487.44 → 2488.62] very predictable sales
[2488.62 → 2489.76] because as the new one
[2489.76 → 2490.24] is coming,
[2490.80 → 2492.12] the old one just like
[2492.12 → 2494.18] kind of trickles off
[2494.18 → 2495.64] in terms of supply
[2495.64 → 2497.32] and then by the time
[2497.32 → 2498.36] they're gone,
[2498.82 → 2500.32] they kind of are selling
[2500.32 → 2500.98] slower anyway
[2500.98 → 2502.00] and you're ready to transition
[2502.00 → 2502.68] into the new one
[2502.68 → 2503.82] and there's never really a gap.
[2504.30 → 2506.00] It's actually kind of magical
[2506.00 → 2506.58] how well they,
[2506.66 → 2508.78] people think Intel,
[2509.46 → 2510.62] I don't think anyone thinks
[2510.62 → 2511.68] Intel's a marketing company,
[2511.68 → 2513.84] but people think Intel
[2513.84 → 2515.06] is an engineering company
[2515.06 → 2516.24] and they are,
[2516.60 → 2517.92] but what they also are
[2517.92 → 2518.94] is a supply chain company.
[2518.94 → 2519.94] They've talked about it before.
[2520.10 → 2521.00] They're perfect
[2521.00 → 2522.28] at supply chain.
[2524.12 → 2525.40] So they'll be taking orders
[2525.40 → 2525.92] of these chips
[2525.92 → 2527.42] through March 30th of 2018
[2527.42 → 2528.12] and shipping them
[2528.12 → 2529.38] through to September 2018,
[2530.48 → 2531.64] but I mean,
[2531.70 → 2532.58] the reason that they want
[2532.58 → 2533.14] to get rid of them
[2533.14 → 2533.76] is that they would be
[2533.76 → 2534.70] taking up fab space
[2534.70 → 2535.54] that could be used
[2535.54 → 2537.76] for other 14 nanometre products.
[2538.24 → 2540.30] So yeah, whatever.
[2540.30 → 2542.16] rumour,
[2543.16 → 2544.52] Google preparing
[2544.52 → 2547.42] to buy HTC's phone division.
[2547.92 → 2548.72] So this was posted
[2548.72 → 2550.10] by Daring on the forum
[2550.10 → 2551.26] and I like that name
[2551.26 → 2552.14] for this news
[2552.14 → 2553.66] because that
[2553.66 → 2555.12] would be pretty daring.
[2555.64 → 2556.48] HTC and Google
[2556.48 → 2557.14] support,
[2557.32 → 2558.00] supposedly,
[2558.46 → 2559.40] in final stage
[2559.40 → 2560.10] of negotiation
[2560.10 → 2560.88] regarding sale
[2560.88 → 2562.90] of smartphone business.
[2563.56 → 2564.36] I mean,
[2564.96 → 2566.82] I see this being,
[2567.28 → 2568.24] okay,
[2568.24 → 2569.32] so there are a couple of things here.
[2569.40 → 2570.22] I see this being
[2570.22 → 2572.32] good news for HTC
[2572.32 → 2573.22] in that it gives them
[2573.22 → 2574.10] an exit strategy
[2574.10 → 2575.76] and bad news for HTC
[2575.76 → 2576.42] in that
[2576.42 → 2577.50] What do you do?
[2578.42 → 2579.40] any relevance
[2579.40 → 2580.46] that they could have
[2580.46 → 2581.76] possibly hoped to have.
[2583.10 → 2583.46] I mean,
[2583.62 → 2584.30] I don't know
[2584.30 → 2584.84] if the company
[2584.84 → 2585.60] is going to survive
[2585.60 → 2586.18] on Five,
[2586.18 → 2588.44] but maybe they keep
[2588.44 → 2589.88] a very small
[2589.88 → 2592.78] VR team
[2592.78 → 2593.86] that VRs
[2593.86 → 2593.96] or,
[2594.10 → 2594.72] and I think they do,
[2594.88 → 2595.08] like,
[2595.12 → 2595.76] they obviously do
[2595.76 → 2596.66] some OEM production
[2596.66 → 2598.04] because they did
[2598.04 → 2598.86] produce the Pixel.
[2598.86 → 2602.24] they were the only,
[2602.24 → 2602.98] they were the only
[2602.98 → 2603.68] Android maker
[2603.68 → 2604.90] with little enough
[2604.90 → 2605.46] self-respect
[2605.46 → 2606.36] that they were willing
[2606.36 → 2606.86] to let Google
[2606.86 → 2607.38] get away with
[2607.38 → 2608.02] not putting their
[2608.02 → 2608.78] brand on the Pixel.
[2609.38 → 2609.52] So,
[2609.62 → 2609.82] like,
[2610.36 → 2610.90] I mean,
[2611.08 → 2613.56] it's been a bad time
[2613.56 → 2614.66] to be HTC
[2614.66 → 2615.72] for the last few years.
[2615.92 → 2616.16] Five is,
[2616.28 → 2616.32] like,
[2616.42 → 2617.30] VR has been doing
[2617.30 → 2618.28] a little bit better lately.
[2618.90 → 2619.96] Sales have kicked up
[2619.96 → 2620.70] because of the discounts
[2620.70 → 2621.36] on the headsets
[2621.36 → 2621.82] and stuff.
[2621.96 → 2622.90] It's been happening.
[2623.06 → 2624.06] There are some big games
[2624.06 → 2624.42] coming out,
[2624.50 → 2624.68] actually.
[2624.80 → 2625.98] I got to play Doom VR
[2625.98 → 2627.10] at PAX.
[2627.26 → 2628.32] It was actually pretty good.
[2628.86 → 2629.66] I don't think
[2629.66 → 2630.24] I'd like it.
[2630.60 → 2632.74] I bought Arizona Sunshine
[2632.74 → 2633.28] and it's,
[2633.36 → 2633.46] like,
[2633.54 → 2633.90] scary.
[2634.90 → 2635.10] Like,
[2635.16 → 2635.34] I,
[2635.48 → 2635.60] like,
[2635.94 → 2636.60] get freaked out.
[2636.60 → 2636.62] Okay,
[2636.64 → 2636.74] yeah,
[2636.80 → 2637.20] but there's,
[2637.20 → 2638.58] there's Skyrim
[2638.58 → 2639.64] and Fallout as well.
[2640.40 → 2641.04] I would probably
[2641.04 → 2641.86] still get scared.
[2642.42 → 2643.08] Fallout's maybe
[2643.08 → 2643.66] a little scary.
[2644.00 → 2644.14] Like,
[2644.24 → 2644.84] even the-
[2644.84 → 2645.04] Skyrim has some
[2645.04 → 2645.66] creepy stuff.
[2645.86 → 2646.04] Alright,
[2646.38 → 2646.66] alright.
[2646.80 → 2647.58] Bethesda makes
[2647.58 → 2648.22] creepy games.
[2648.40 → 2648.56] Yeah,
[2648.58 → 2648.94] I mean,
[2649.36 → 2650.42] the thing is that,
[2650.48 → 2650.60] like,
[2650.66 → 2651.98] I usually play VR
[2651.98 → 2652.46] when I'm,
[2652.58 → 2652.68] like,
[2653.48 → 2654.18] I just want to
[2654.18 → 2655.26] relax for a little bit.
[2655.64 → 2655.78] Like,
[2655.82 → 2656.18] I just,
[2656.44 → 2656.72] so,
[2656.90 → 2658.24] what I usually play
[2658.24 → 2659.98] is the longbow game
[2659.98 → 2660.48] in the lab.
[2661.18 → 2661.38] Yeah,
[2661.42 → 2661.56] okay.
[2661.56 → 2662.32] It's really fun.
[2662.60 → 2662.76] Yeah.
[2662.80 → 2663.84] And it's all cartoon
[2663.84 → 2664.42] and happy
[2664.42 → 2664.84] and,
[2664.94 → 2665.02] like,
[2665.06 → 2666.04] even when you lose,
[2666.42 → 2667.00] it's like,
[2667.28 → 2668.44] we got your castle.
[2669.64 → 2670.04] And,
[2670.16 → 2670.24] like,
[2670.26 → 2670.86] there are balloons
[2670.86 → 2671.38] and stuff.
[2671.48 → 2672.24] You don't really care.
[2672.52 → 2673.60] Just jump into another one.
[2673.64 → 2674.30] And the other day,
[2674.38 → 2675.06] I was playing
[2675.06 → 2676.24] the survival mode
[2676.24 → 2677.04] of Arizona Sunshine
[2677.04 → 2680.66] and I got to the level
[2680.66 → 2681.02] where they,
[2681.10 → 2681.24] like,
[2681.26 → 2682.54] start running at you
[2682.54 → 2683.64] and I was,
[2683.72 → 2683.78] like,
[2683.82 → 2684.34] killing guys
[2684.34 → 2684.84] and there was a guy
[2684.84 → 2685.18] like me.
[2685.22 → 2685.50] I was like,
[2685.54 → 2686.16] I don't give you a minute.
[2686.20 → 2686.78] You're so big
[2686.78 → 2688.04] and you're really creepy
[2688.04 → 2688.54] and scary.
[2690.14 → 2691.36] My dad played
[2691.36 → 2692.62] the Fallout game,
[2692.92 → 2693.32] Fallout VR,
[2693.64 → 2694.48] and he was,
[2694.48 → 2694.68] like,
[2694.72 → 2695.64] looking at the dog
[2695.64 → 2695.86] and,
[2695.96 → 2696.10] like,
[2696.12 → 2697.02] kind of pretending
[2697.02 → 2697.78] to pet it in VR
[2697.78 → 2698.04] and stuff.
[2698.24 → 2698.74] And then a zombie
[2698.74 → 2699.36] comes up and,
[2699.50 → 2699.54] like,
[2699.62 → 2700.48] hits the dog
[2700.48 → 2701.48] and my dad,
[2701.54 → 2701.70] like,
[2701.80 → 2702.96] launched backwards
[2702.96 → 2704.04] in real life
[2704.04 → 2705.12] and,
[2705.24 → 2705.28] like,
[2705.32 → 2706.12] one of the demo ladies
[2706.12 → 2706.36] had to,
[2706.40 → 2706.50] like,
[2706.54 → 2707.50] jump out of the way
[2707.50 → 2708.38] and he immediately
[2708.38 → 2708.76] goes to,
[2708.88 → 2708.92] like,
[2709.00 → 2709.90] commando position,
[2710.34 → 2710.54] like,
[2710.66 → 2711.42] holding the gun,
[2711.52 → 2712.26] goes like this
[2712.26 → 2713.14] because it's just a pistol
[2713.14 → 2714.92] and it starts popping zombies.
[2715.06 → 2715.28] I'm like,
[2715.38 → 2715.82] whoa!
[2718.22 → 2718.62] Just,
[2718.72 → 2718.94] like,
[2719.26 → 2720.62] immediately burst into action
[2720.62 → 2721.12] because something
[2721.12 → 2722.10] hit his damn dog.
[2724.86 → 2725.26] It's,
[2725.38 → 2725.42] like,
[2725.46 → 2726.18] the fastest way
[2726.18 → 2727.06] to piss my dad off.
[2728.26 → 2728.68] And so,
[2728.78 → 2729.34] those three games
[2729.34 → 2730.10] are coming all big
[2730.10 → 2730.78] from Bethesda
[2730.78 → 2731.70] and then there's
[2731.70 → 2732.58] other VR games
[2732.58 → 2733.10] that are continuing
[2733.10 → 2733.60] to come out
[2733.60 → 2734.68] from more VR-focused
[2734.68 → 2735.16] developers.
[2736.36 → 2736.54] It's,
[2736.64 → 2736.96] it's,
[2737.40 → 2738.64] VR stuff is becoming
[2738.64 → 2739.40] more legitimate,
[2739.58 → 2740.16] especially with these
[2740.16 → 2740.74] big titles.
[2740.90 → 2741.02] Oh,
[2741.12 → 2741.62] here you go!
[2743.18 → 2744.08] VR is,
[2744.26 → 2745.16] has been spun off
[2745.16 → 2746.00] as a standalone
[2746.00 → 2747.32] subsidiary already anyway.
[2747.68 → 2747.86] Yeah.
[2747.90 → 2748.06] So,
[2748.24 → 2749.40] Google's incentive here
[2749.40 → 2750.40] is that
[2750.40 → 2751.80] they want to produce
[2751.80 → 2752.58] hardware.
[2753.66 → 2754.22] Routers,
[2754.80 → 2755.38] phones,
[2756.02 → 2756.84] whatever.
[2757.10 → 2758.02] Google is getting
[2758.02 → 2759.24] into consumer electronics
[2759.24 → 2761.34] and HTC
[2761.34 → 2762.16] has
[2762.16 → 2762.88] good
[2762.88 → 2763.88] manufacturing
[2763.88 → 2764.94] facilities
[2764.94 → 2765.70] and expertise.
[2765.70 → 2766.02] What was that?
[2766.10 → 2766.88] Was it the M9
[2766.88 → 2767.60] or M8?
[2768.24 → 2768.84] Which one?
[2768.84 → 2768.86] That was,
[2768.98 → 2769.04] like,
[2769.12 → 2770.14] the one piece
[2770.14 → 2770.68] of aluminum.
[2770.94 → 2771.48] The M7
[2771.48 → 2772.30] was the first one
[2772.30 → 2773.06] that really got
[2773.06 → 2773.76] everyone's attention
[2773.76 → 2773.94] and,
[2774.04 → 2774.12] like,
[2774.18 → 2775.58] made HTC
[2775.58 → 2776.36] relevant again
[2776.36 → 2777.70] for however short
[2777.70 → 2778.44] a period of time.
[2778.48 → 2779.48] They can do that stuff.
[2783.48 → 2783.76] But,
[2783.88 → 2785.48] yeah.
[2786.10 → 2786.30] So,
[2786.42 → 2787.26] I see what's in it
[2787.26 → 2787.62] for Google.
[2787.78 → 2788.44] I see what's in it
[2788.44 → 2789.04] for HTC.
[2789.16 → 2789.70] They had their
[2789.70 → 2790.66] the worst month
[2790.66 → 2791.14] in the past
[2791.14 → 2792.16] 13 years.
[2792.84 → 2793.04] Wow.
[2794.04 → 2794.88] In August,
[2795.04 → 2795.66] revenue dropped
[2795.66 → 2797.28] by 51.5%
[2797.28 → 2798.20] compared to last month
[2798.20 → 2799.78] and 54.3%
[2799.78 → 2800.80] from last August.
[2801.60 → 2801.72] So,
[2801.80 → 2802.06] like,
[2802.74 → 2803.22] yeah,
[2803.34 → 2804.34] I totally see this
[2804.34 → 2804.92] making sense
[2804.92 → 2805.42] and Google's
[2805.42 → 2806.20] probably the most
[2806.20 → 2806.96] sensible buyer
[2806.96 → 2807.90] that I can think of.
[2808.48 → 2809.20] Pretty cool.
[2810.06 → 2810.52] Um,
[2810.98 → 2812.28] all right.
[2812.44 → 2813.28] That's boring.
[2813.80 → 2814.70] That's boring.
[2816.10 → 2816.58] Um,
[2817.90 → 2819.26] wow.
[2819.58 → 2819.86] Okay.
[2819.98 → 2820.12] Uh,
[2820.12 → 2820.80] there is something
[2820.80 → 2821.54] important to say
[2821.54 → 2822.16] about this.
[2822.36 → 2822.62] Oh,
[2822.72 → 2822.98] okay.
[2823.06 → 2823.60] Just one
[2823.60 → 2824.32] really quick thing.
[2824.34 → 2824.56] Okay,
[2824.62 → 2824.94] hold on.
[2825.02 → 2825.10] Well,
[2825.10 → 2825.64] I'll bring it up then.
[2825.70 → 2826.06] This was posted
[2826.06 → 2826.72] by Scratch Cat
[2826.72 → 2827.30] on the forum.
[2827.42 → 2827.74] The original
[2827.74 → 2828.48] article's from
[2828.48 → 2829.02] CBC.
[2830.58 → 2831.58] 143 million
[2831.58 → 2831.92] U.S.
[2832.00 → 2832.66] consumers may
[2832.66 → 2833.30] have been affected
[2833.30 → 2834.32] in a cyberattack.
[2834.90 → 2835.30] Yeah,
[2835.36 → 2836.00] so this is an
[2836.00 → 2836.66] Equifax
[2836.66 → 2837.88] cyberattack thing.
[2838.06 → 2838.78] I don't know
[2838.78 → 2839.36] enough about it.
[2839.52 → 2840.70] We often stay away
[2840.70 → 2841.14] from,
[2841.60 → 2842.22] not always,
[2842.22 → 2842.94] but we often stay
[2842.94 → 2843.36] away from
[2843.36 → 2844.16] political stuff,
[2844.36 → 2845.12] especially American
[2845.12 → 2846.22] political stuff
[2846.22 → 2846.96] because we're not
[2846.96 → 2848.62] fully up to spec
[2848.62 → 2849.10] on it because
[2849.10 → 2849.98] we're not Americans.
[2850.58 → 2850.86] Um,
[2850.86 → 2851.88] but I do want
[2851.88 → 2852.68] to put this out here.
[2853.04 → 2853.68] It's been mentioned
[2853.68 → 2854.52] a few times.
[2854.62 → 2854.90] I don't know
[2854.90 → 2855.62] if it's true or not,
[2855.68 → 2856.22] but do your own
[2856.22 → 2856.66] research.
[2857.16 → 2858.44] To check if you've
[2858.44 → 2859.02] been affected,
[2859.84 → 2861.14] you have to
[2861.14 → 2862.08] click yes to an
[2862.08 → 2862.36] agreement.
[2862.78 → 2863.48] And most people
[2863.48 → 2864.22] just fly through
[2864.22 → 2864.92] and click yes to
[2864.92 → 2865.32] everything.
[2865.80 → 2866.48] And the agreement
[2866.48 → 2867.34] is that you will
[2867.34 → 2868.18] not join a
[2868.18 → 2869.04] class action lawsuit.
[2869.04 → 2872.74] So be careful.
[2872.94 → 2873.86] I don't 100%
[2873.86 → 2874.38] know if that's
[2874.38 → 2874.64] true,
[2874.76 → 2875.42] but I've seen it
[2875.42 → 2876.14] in a lot of
[2876.14 → 2876.88] places and it
[2876.88 → 2877.64] seems to be true.
[2877.82 → 2878.78] I would read it
[2878.78 → 2879.24] yourself.
[2879.80 → 2880.24] Um,
[2880.24 → 2881.24] but basically the
[2881.24 → 2882.22] consensus is right
[2882.22 → 2882.50] now,
[2882.50 → 2883.44] if you've done
[2883.44 → 2884.10] anything with
[2884.10 → 2884.68] Equifax,
[2884.80 → 2885.58] assume that you're
[2885.58 → 2885.94] affected.
[2886.42 → 2887.36] Don't do the
[2887.36 → 2888.12] check to see if
[2888.12 → 2888.38] you are.
[2888.40 → 2888.74] Which is great
[2888.74 → 2889.84] because Equifax
[2889.84 → 2891.60] is like...
[2891.60 → 2892.84] Huge deal.
[2893.18 → 2893.82] And like you can
[2893.82 → 2894.28] very,
[2894.44 → 2895.44] very likely have
[2895.44 → 2896.12] your identity be
[2896.12 → 2896.36] stolen.
[2896.36 → 2897.34] Um,
[2897.44 → 2897.80] but yeah,
[2897.90 → 2898.60] be very careful.
[2898.90 → 2899.32] That's who you go
[2899.32 → 2900.20] to when you're at
[2900.20 → 2900.96] risk of identity
[2900.96 → 2901.30] theft,
[2901.40 → 2901.92] which is great.
[2902.24 → 2902.44] I don't even
[2902.44 → 2902.68] know.
[2902.82 → 2903.02] Yeah,
[2903.24 → 2903.60] no,
[2903.66 → 2904.08] it's like,
[2904.16 → 2904.50] actually,
[2904.68 → 2904.78] um,
[2905.04 → 2905.92] apparently some
[2905.92 → 2906.76] Canadian and UK
[2906.76 → 2907.40] residents,
[2908.06 → 2908.70] um,
[2908.76 → 2909.50] an undisclosed
[2909.50 → 2909.94] number,
[2910.28 → 2910.80] um,
[2912.06 → 2912.60] were also
[2912.60 → 2913.22] accessed.
[2913.32 → 2914.00] So personal
[2914.00 → 2914.60] information for
[2914.60 → 2914.94] those guys.
[2915.08 → 2915.20] Yeah,
[2915.22 → 2915.60] and I don't,
[2915.68 → 2916.20] I don't know how
[2916.20 → 2917.20] well that thing
[2917.20 → 2917.78] that you're agreeing
[2917.78 → 2918.38] to is going to
[2918.38 → 2919.10] actually hold up.
[2919.22 → 2920.20] I suspect not at
[2920.20 → 2920.44] all.
[2920.58 → 2920.94] I hold up.
[2921.12 → 2921.20] I,
[2921.50 → 2921.64] yeah,
[2921.70 → 2922.16] I agree,
[2922.28 → 2923.18] but just be careful
[2923.18 → 2923.82] when you're clicking
[2923.82 → 2924.34] all this kind of
[2924.34 → 2924.76] stuff and just
[2924.76 → 2925.28] kind of assume
[2925.28 → 2925.78] if you've dealt
[2925.78 → 2926.20] with them that
[2926.20 → 2926.64] you're probably
[2926.64 → 2926.98] screwed.
[2928.22 → 2928.66] Um,
[2929.14 → 2929.40] yeah,
[2929.50 → 2930.14] that's all I have
[2930.14 → 2930.60] to say about
[2930.60 → 2931.06] that one.
[2933.32 → 2933.76] Okay.
[2935.04 → 2935.48] Wow.
[2936.70 → 2937.14] Um,
[2937.28 → 2937.58] full plate.
[2938.80 → 2939.32] Um,
[2939.58 → 2939.98] oh,
[2940.06 → 2940.60] WhatsApp is
[2940.60 → 2941.48] finally monetizing.
[2941.70 → 2942.14] Oh my.
[2942.56 → 2943.00] Interesting.
[2943.16 → 2943.54] So this was
[2943.54 → 2944.20] originally posted
[2944.20 → 2944.88] by TechCrunch.
[2945.92 → 2946.16] Whoops.
[2947.82 → 2948.26] WhatsApp's
[2948.26 → 2949.56] first ads
[2949.56 → 2950.28] appear on
[2950.28 → 2950.68] Facebook
[2950.68 → 2950.82] Facebook
[2950.82 → 2951.98] and start
[2951.98 → 2952.96] conversations
[2952.96 → 2954.62] with businesses.
[2955.88 → 2956.28] Dun,
[2956.40 → 2956.92] dun,
[2957.04 → 2957.56] dun.
[2958.34 → 2959.02] So they announced
[2959.02 → 2960.08] their plan
[2960.08 → 2960.78] to eventually
[2960.78 → 2962.04] charge businesses
[2962.04 → 2963.16] stirring worries
[2963.16 → 2963.88] that businesses
[2963.88 → 2965.10] might be able
[2965.10 → 2966.26] to cold message
[2966.26 → 2966.96] users with
[2966.96 → 2968.14] sponsored message
[2968.14 → 2968.64] ads.
[2968.76 → 2969.08] I want to drop
[2969.08 → 2969.48] this in here.
[2969.56 → 2970.46] Apparently a New York
[2970.46 → 2971.14] attorney general
[2971.14 → 2971.72] is already
[2971.72 → 2972.76] totally crapping
[2972.76 → 2973.44] on that agreement.
[2974.22 → 2974.52] Okay.
[2974.64 → 2975.20] So like,
[2975.40 → 2976.14] it's probably
[2976.14 → 2976.84] not a big deal.
[2976.94 → 2977.06] Just,
[2977.46 → 2978.36] just be aware
[2978.36 → 2978.98] of what's going
[2978.98 → 2979.46] on if you're
[2979.46 → 2980.14] affected by that.
[2980.54 → 2981.24] So now,
[2981.66 → 2982.36] code in
[2982.36 → 2982.90] Facebook's
[2982.90 → 2983.38] ad manager
[2983.38 → 2984.04] has been found
[2984.04 → 2984.38] that lets
[2984.38 → 2984.78] businesses
[2984.78 → 2985.70] buy ads
[2985.70 → 2986.20] with a
[2986.20 → 2986.84] send a
[2986.84 → 2987.68] WhatsApp message
[2987.68 → 2988.56] button built in.
[2989.06 → 2989.58] For now,
[2989.72 → 2990.38] WhatsApp isn't
[2990.38 → 2990.84] selling ads
[2990.84 → 2991.30] on its own,
[2991.40 → 2991.86] but testing
[2991.86 → 2992.44] a WhatsApp
[2992.44 → 2993.06] chat button
[2993.06 → 2993.60] on Facebook
[2993.60 → 2994.08] ads that
[2994.08 → 2994.68] directly opens
[2994.68 → 2995.30] a conversation
[2995.30 → 2995.92] with a business
[2995.92 → 2996.42] in WhatsApp.
[2997.38 → 2997.88] Businesses
[2997.88 → 2998.38] will only be
[2998.38 → 2998.60] able to
[2998.60 → 2998.92] contact
[2998.92 → 2999.56] WhatsApp users
[2999.56 → 2999.90] that have
[2999.90 → 3000.40] agreed to
[3000.40 → 3002.42] be messaged
[3002.42 → 3003.10] by initiating
[3003.10 → 3003.82] the conversation,
[3004.34 → 3004.90] and sponsored
[3004.90 → 3005.46] messages will
[3005.46 → 3006.00] work the same
[3006.00 → 3006.58] way on Facebook
[3006.58 → 3007.02] Messenger.
[3007.44 → 3007.96] So businesses
[3007.96 → 3008.64] can pay to
[3008.64 → 3009.16] reconnect with
[3009.16 → 3009.62] people they're
[3009.62 → 3010.28] already chatting
[3010.28 → 3010.58] with.
[3012.18 → 3013.12] WhatsApp initially
[3013.12 → 3013.74] promised not
[3013.74 → 3014.28] to show ads
[3014.28 → 3014.58] when it was
[3014.58 → 3015.00] acquired by
[3015.00 → 3015.52] Facebook for
[3015.52 → 3016.20] $19 billion
[3016.20 → 3016.90] in 2014,
[3017.30 → 3018.44] but I mean,
[3018.54 → 3019.42] I don't know
[3019.42 → 3020.14] exactly what we
[3020.14 → 3020.72] said about it
[3020.72 → 3021.20] at the time,
[3021.30 → 3021.74] but I'm pretty
[3021.74 → 3022.50] sure we probably
[3022.50 → 3025.24] called BS on that.
[3025.24 → 3028.50] A retailer
[3028.50 → 3029.54] apparently confirms
[3029.54 → 3030.14] this was posted
[3030.14 → 3030.70] by Lobster
[3030.70 → 3031.40] Goldberg on
[3031.40 → 3031.92] the forum,
[3033.00 → 3033.58] an October
[3033.58 → 3034.46] 5th date
[3034.46 → 3035.88] for six core
[3035.88 → 3037.10] Coffee Lake
[3037.10 → 3037.98] processors.
[3039.60 → 3040.00] Dun,
[3040.12 → 3040.62] dun,
[3040.76 → 3041.16] dun.
[3041.80 → 3042.28] This is a
[3042.28 → 3042.84] German site,
[3042.94 → 3043.20] and what we're
[3043.20 → 3043.78] looking at here
[3043.78 → 3045.44] is a Core i7-8700K
[3045.44 → 3046.06] and 8700,
[3046.32 → 3046.88] both with six
[3046.88 → 3047.12] cores,
[3047.22 → 3047.74] 12 threads,
[3047.82 → 3048.58] and 12 legs
[3048.58 → 3049.74] of level 3
[3049.74 → 3050.40] cache.
[3050.40 → 3052.04] Wow.
[3052.46 → 3052.98] Single core
[3052.98 → 3053.46] and multicore
[3053.46 → 3054.44] boost of 4.7
[3054.44 → 3055.10] and 4.3
[3055.10 → 3055.48] gigahertz
[3055.48 → 3055.92] respectively,
[3056.08 → 3056.54] and a TDP
[3056.54 → 3058.74] of 95 watts.
[3059.38 → 3060.20] Looking pretty
[3060.20 → 3060.70] good,
[3060.82 → 3061.60] looking pretty
[3061.60 → 3062.30] specific.
[3062.70 → 3063.22] I'm pretty
[3063.22 → 3063.72] stoked.
[3064.82 → 3065.54] I've been
[3065.54 → 3066.10] pretty clear
[3066.10 → 3066.56] that I'm
[3066.56 → 3067.20] super down
[3067.20 → 3067.68] for Coffee
[3067.68 → 3067.98] Lake.
[3068.16 → 3068.84] Six core
[3068.84 → 3069.52] mainstream
[3069.52 → 3070.56] basically gives
[3070.56 → 3071.78] most people
[3071.78 → 3072.40] no reason
[3072.40 → 3072.98] to blow a bunch
[3072.98 → 3073.20] of money
[3073.20 → 3073.94] on X299
[3073.94 → 3074.96] or X399,
[3075.34 → 3076.94] so super
[3076.94 → 3077.38] awesome.
[3077.38 → 3081.72] And that's
[3081.72 → 3082.34] pretty much
[3082.34 → 3082.66] it.
[3084.46 → 3085.06] Oh,
[3085.44 → 3085.84] oh.
[3087.50 → 3087.82] Organization
[3087.82 → 3088.90] vlog 3
[3088.90 → 3089.46] trailer.
[3089.82 → 3090.14] Oh,
[3090.28 → 3090.60] damn.
[3090.80 → 3091.52] Is on
[3091.52 → 3092.40] Facebook now,
[3092.48 → 3092.76] apparently,
[3092.94 → 3093.52] so we can show
[3093.52 → 3093.70] it.
[3093.90 → 3094.30] Nice.
[3094.50 → 3094.68] Yep.
[3094.94 → 3095.50] We're going to have
[3095.50 → 3095.92] to do the
[3095.92 → 3096.56] Jacky,
[3096.74 → 3097.70] stupid audio
[3097.70 → 3098.42] sharing thing.
[3098.52 → 3098.82] Actually,
[3099.06 → 3099.50] do we?
[3099.92 → 3100.42] Hold on.
[3100.52 → 3101.10] Hold on.
[3101.44 → 3102.22] Hold on.
[3102.52 → 3103.04] Maybe there's
[3103.04 → 3104.08] a better way.
[3105.76 → 3106.20] You don't have
[3106.20 → 3106.58] to do the
[3106.58 → 3107.06] Doppler effect
[3107.06 → 3107.38] when you're
[3107.38 → 3108.06] literally walking
[3108.06 → 3108.56] away from the
[3108.56 → 3108.76] mic.
[3109.94 → 3110.30] Like,
[3110.32 → 3110.58] you don't have
[3110.58 → 3111.50] to mimic it
[3111.50 → 3112.12] because,
[3112.20 → 3112.26] like,
[3112.28 → 3112.62] it's actually
[3112.62 → 3113.02] happening.
[3117.12 → 3118.48] I don't know
[3118.48 → 3119.06] what to tell you.
[3119.26 → 3120.06] I don't see it.
[3120.64 → 3121.24] Hold on.
[3121.78 → 3122.52] Maybe there's
[3122.52 → 3123.28] a better way.
[3124.88 → 3125.24] Oh,
[3125.28 → 3125.82] there it is.
[3126.64 → 3127.00] Oh,
[3127.02 → 3127.64] this is exciting.
[3127.74 → 3128.10] I haven't seen
[3128.10 → 3128.40] this trailer.
[3128.58 → 3128.72] We got this.
[3128.78 → 3129.28] We got this.
[3129.60 → 3129.84] Okay.
[3129.96 → 3130.76] One hour ago.
[3130.86 → 3130.98] Now,
[3131.02 → 3131.36] hold on.
[3131.42 → 3131.72] Hold on.
[3131.82 → 3132.90] I have to set up.
[3133.12 → 3133.38] Okay,
[3133.48 → 3133.94] I think.
[3135.26 → 3135.58] Okay,
[3135.58 → 3136.46] so I apologize
[3136.46 → 3137.44] in advance
[3137.44 → 3139.26] if I am
[3139.26 → 3140.48] wrecking
[3140.48 → 3140.98] your guys'
[3141.18 → 3142.18] ears.
[3144.98 → 3145.78] Are people
[3145.78 → 3146.16] complaining
[3146.16 → 3146.80] about the sound
[3146.80 → 3147.26] already?
[3148.32 → 3148.70] Okay.
[3149.38 → 3150.54] I don't know
[3150.54 → 3151.34] if this is
[3151.34 → 3152.24] going to work.
[3153.90 → 3154.54] Hold on.
[3154.62 → 3155.02] Let me try
[3155.02 → 3155.72] playing this.
[3158.52 → 3158.96] Okay,
[3159.04 → 3159.68] it's working,
[3159.90 → 3160.76] but it looks like
[3160.76 → 3161.58] it's pretty quiet
[3161.58 → 3162.70] on the levels,
[3163.06 → 3163.80] so I'm going
[3163.80 → 3164.24] to turn it up
[3164.24 → 3164.56] a bit,
[3164.84 → 3165.40] and I'm going
[3165.40 → 3165.60] to hope
[3165.60 → 3166.20] for the best.
[3167.08 → 3167.48] Okay,
[3167.80 → 3168.84] here we go.
[3169.58 → 3170.08] Continue,
[3170.38 → 3170.82] click to enter
[3170.82 → 3171.40] full screen.
[3172.54 → 3172.78] Dun,
[3173.00 → 3173.36] dun,
[3173.54 → 3173.96] dun.
[3175.88 → 3176.90] So this is up
[3176.90 → 3177.88] on float plane
[3177.88 → 3178.36] already,
[3179.06 → 3181.18] and hopefully
[3181.18 → 3181.92] this is going
[3181.92 → 3182.28] to work.
[3183.34 → 3184.06] Way to go,
[3184.32 → 3185.12] Facebook video.
[3185.86 → 3186.70] Thank you
[3186.70 → 3187.54] for everything
[3187.54 → 3188.66] about what you are.
[3188.66 → 3189.10] giving me
[3189.10 → 3189.74] promotions for
[3189.74 → 3190.36] a float plane.
[3191.50 → 3192.12] Get it?
[3193.22 → 3194.16] What is going
[3194.16 → 3194.82] on here?
[3195.36 → 3196.00] Click for more.
[3196.08 → 3196.28] How about
[3196.28 → 3197.04] a just work
[3197.04 → 3198.30] option?
[3198.38 → 3198.86] What if I click
[3198.86 → 3199.38] on how about
[3199.38 → 3199.82] you work?
[3200.94 → 3201.58] That would be
[3201.58 → 3202.22] great now.
[3203.38 → 3203.78] Really?
[3205.02 → 3205.46] Okay,
[3205.64 → 3206.06] let's just
[3206.06 → 3207.44] reload the page.
[3207.46 → 3207.86] This is awesome.
[3208.58 → 3209.10] Why?
[3210.20 → 3210.78] Why you
[3210.78 → 3211.26] no work?
[3211.34 → 3211.68] Well,
[3211.82 → 3212.36] while we get
[3212.36 → 3212.88] this trailer
[3212.88 → 3213.44] spun up,
[3213.52 → 3214.24] if you go
[3214.24 → 3215.28] and look
[3215.28 → 3216.04] on float plane,
[3216.16 → 3216.70] you can just
[3216.70 → 3217.38] watch the whole
[3217.38 → 3218.12] thing right now.
[3218.12 → 3218.74] So if you're
[3218.74 → 3219.26] a float plane
[3219.26 → 3219.86] subscriber,
[3220.56 → 3221.52] instead of just
[3221.52 → 3222.48] watching the trailer
[3222.48 → 3223.40] on Sancho
[3223.40 → 3224.02] through Linus'
[3224.16 → 3224.54] laptop,
[3224.76 → 3225.42] which is failing
[3225.42 → 3225.88] to load
[3225.88 → 3226.60] because Facebook,
[3227.00 → 3227.70] you can just
[3227.70 → 3228.36] go watch it
[3228.36 → 3229.56] on the forum.
[3234.88 → 3235.44] Thanks,
[3235.54 → 3235.86] Bixby.
[3238.36 → 3238.84] Actually?
[3241.68 → 3242.72] I'm even like,
[3242.92 → 3243.12] like,
[3243.16 → 3243.60] is Twitch
[3243.60 → 3244.54] explaining to me
[3244.54 → 3245.36] how this works?
[3245.36 → 3247.14] No.
[3248.04 → 3248.64] In some way?
[3249.02 → 3249.70] I wonder if
[3249.70 → 3250.16] it's this
[3250.16 → 3251.52] sound device
[3251.52 → 3252.44] that's
[3252.44 → 3253.16] glitching it out.
[3254.60 → 3255.12] What?
[3256.10 → 3256.96] What even,
[3257.12 → 3258.04] what even just,
[3258.32 → 3258.40] I,
[3258.88 → 3260.08] see,
[3260.32 → 3260.56] this,
[3260.68 → 3261.16] this is what
[3261.16 → 3261.66] I have to deal
[3261.66 → 3262.32] with around here.
[3262.68 → 3262.86] Oh,
[3263.18 → 3263.72] okay,
[3263.88 → 3264.32] so it's
[3264.32 → 3265.02] supposedly working
[3265.02 → 3265.30] now.
[3265.54 → 3266.56] I wonder if
[3266.56 → 3267.32] it hates my,
[3267.56 → 3269.28] the Scarlet
[3269.28 → 3270.18] as a sound output.
[3270.56 → 3271.54] That would be weird.
[3271.54 → 3272.76] My entire life is...
[3272.76 → 3273.04] Okay,
[3273.24 → 3273.48] no,
[3273.60 → 3274.04] it seems like
[3274.04 → 3274.64] it's working now.
[3275.02 → 3275.26] Okay.
[3275.36 → 3276.56] What the crap?
[3277.98 → 3278.50] All right,
[3278.76 → 3279.38] so let's do it.
[3279.44 → 3279.96] Let's do it!
[3281.16 → 3281.90] Moving boxes
[3281.90 → 3282.66] from one shelf
[3282.66 → 3283.14] to the other
[3283.14 → 3283.68] and then back
[3283.68 → 3284.32] to the other shelf.
[3284.64 → 3285.32] I can't hear it.
[3285.54 → 3285.90] Also,
[3285.96 → 3287.00] the quality looks like crap.
[3287.12 → 3287.84] You want better quality?
[3287.92 → 3289.06] Messier than it was before.
[3289.30 → 3289.54] Well,
[3289.68 → 3290.24] you know what?
[3290.42 → 3291.86] I don't f***ING know.
[3293.28 → 3293.64] 270p?
[3294.78 → 3296.32] That's a bit better.
[3296.58 → 3296.98] Go away.
[3297.04 → 3297.24] Yeah,
[3297.32 → 3298.06] it's not great.
[3298.20 → 3298.34] What?
[3298.34 → 3298.50] Hey,
[3298.56 → 3299.60] you guys thought about
[3299.60 → 3300.44] forming a union
[3300.44 → 3301.32] because...
[3301.32 → 3301.58] Hey!
[3302.74 → 3303.50] You know what?
[3303.74 → 3304.78] I'll burn your house down.
[3305.28 → 3306.12] Residents in a
[3306.12 → 3306.76] Surrey complex
[3306.76 → 3307.44] start running
[3307.44 → 3308.50] down the hallways.
[3311.46 → 3311.96] Oh,
[3312.00 → 3312.66] that's exciting.
[3314.04 → 3314.64] Oh,
[3314.70 → 3314.98] man.
[3315.24 → 3316.42] The staff unionizes.
[3317.38 → 3319.36] Or so they think!
[3321.46 → 3322.88] I do not ex...
[3322.88 → 3323.10] Oh,
[3323.22 → 3323.52] nips.
[3323.86 → 3324.38] There were nips.
[3324.40 → 3324.62] Yeah,
[3324.70 → 3325.06] there were.
[3325.68 → 3326.16] Oh,
[3326.30 → 3326.70] okay.
[3327.94 → 3328.42] Um,
[3328.74 → 3329.66] apparently sound
[3329.66 → 3330.20] is working.
[3330.20 → 3331.06] It's not the intent
[3331.06 → 3331.82] of the content.
[3332.50 → 3332.86] Yeah.
[3333.02 → 3334.00] That actually helps you
[3334.00 → 3334.36] on Twitch.
[3334.38 → 3334.76] Does it?
[3334.78 → 3335.26] You can have like
[3335.26 → 3335.88] full nudity
[3335.88 → 3336.64] if it's not the intent
[3336.64 → 3337.20] of the content.
[3337.52 → 3337.80] Really?
[3337.92 → 3338.14] Like,
[3338.18 → 3339.22] if you play Conan Exiles,
[3339.32 → 3340.30] there's people running around
[3340.30 → 3342.12] dicks out,
[3342.34 → 3342.88] boobs out,
[3343.04 → 3343.34] whatever.
[3343.56 → 3343.82] Right.
[3343.98 → 3344.76] It's not the intent
[3344.76 → 3345.52] of the game.
[3346.16 → 3347.08] It's not the intent
[3347.08 → 3347.58] of the game
[3347.58 → 3348.14] to have dicks
[3348.14 → 3348.78] and boobs out?
[3349.18 → 3349.54] I mean,
[3349.62 → 3349.82] like,
[3349.90 → 3351.08] there's a main objective
[3351.08 → 3351.92] that isn't that.
[3352.14 → 3352.40] Ah,
[3352.40 → 3352.76] I see.
[3352.76 → 3353.60] I think that's more
[3353.60 → 3354.36] what's going on.
[3354.74 → 3355.74] Got it.
[3355.82 → 3356.36] Makes sense.
[3356.72 → 3356.94] Okay,
[3357.00 → 3357.14] well,
[3357.22 → 3357.36] like,
[3357.42 → 3358.48] I want to watch it now
[3358.48 → 3359.44] and I couldn't hear that.
[3359.64 → 3359.80] So,
[3359.88 → 3360.54] we're going to play it again.
[3360.58 → 3361.26] We're totally going
[3361.26 → 3361.90] to play it again.
[3362.00 → 3362.30] Nice.
[3362.76 → 3363.24] Hold on.
[3363.44 → 3364.40] One shelf to the other
[3364.40 → 3365.60] and then back to the other shelf.
[3366.90 → 3367.34] Brandon!
[3368.04 → 3368.86] This place looks
[3368.86 → 3370.34] messier than it was before.
[3370.54 → 3370.82] Well,
[3370.96 → 3371.50] you know what?
[3371.50 → 3373.12] I don't f***ING know.
[3376.02 → 3376.72] F***ING annoying.
[3377.54 → 3378.18] No way.
[3379.42 → 3379.62] Hey,
[3379.68 → 3380.48] you lost the thought
[3380.48 → 3381.06] about forming
[3381.06 → 3382.04] and you keep those.
[3382.48 → 3382.70] Hey!
[3384.70 → 3385.70] Humber and Costa.
[3386.50 → 3387.96] Residents in a Surrey complex
[3387.96 → 3389.48] are running down the hallways.
[3392.14 → 3392.54] Oh,
[3392.54 → 3393.16] my goodness.
[3393.16 → 3394.08] Did you link the chat
[3394.08 → 3395.10] to Float plane already?
[3395.28 → 3395.80] I didn't.
[3395.88 → 3396.18] Okay,
[3396.30 → 3396.50] well,
[3396.56 → 3397.32] you probably should.
[3397.42 → 3397.82] We've got,
[3397.90 → 3399.06] we've got a lot of great stuff
[3399.06 → 3400.46] over on Float plane right now.
[3400.46 → 3401.46] So,
[3401.46 → 3403.46] what do we have?
[3403.52 → 3404.46] We archive the daily
[3404.46 → 3405.68] live streams over there.
[3405.80 → 3406.22] I'm just going to
[3406.22 → 3407.28] screen share with you guys.
[3408.46 → 3409.96] We've got the beanbag chair
[3409.96 → 3410.76] long jump,
[3411.22 → 3411.98] which is like,
[3412.46 → 3413.60] we are going to play
[3413.60 → 3414.44] with balls.
[3414.64 → 3415.06] Um.
[3415.48 → 3416.32] Blue balls!
[3416.80 → 3417.30] Hold on.
[3418.58 → 3418.88] Okay.
[3420.36 → 3420.76] Today,
[3421.08 → 3422.30] we are going to play
[3422.30 → 3422.72] with balls.
[3422.72 → 3423.42] I'm going to ruin
[3423.42 → 3424.14] one moment.
[3424.22 → 3424.72] Blue balls!
[3424.72 → 3425.70] It's not actually
[3425.70 → 3426.68] the best moment,
[3426.98 → 3427.98] but it's a pretty
[3427.98 → 3428.76] epic moment.
[3429.04 → 3429.82] Imaginary tape.
[3429.82 → 3430.94] Doesn't cost anything.
[3431.98 → 3432.78] Hold on.
[3432.90 → 3433.48] Where is it?
[3434.40 → 3435.36] For some reason,
[3435.46 → 3436.38] it wasn't the intro.
[3436.58 → 3437.54] I thought it was
[3437.54 → 3438.40] an awesome intro.
[3439.46 → 3440.40] Where is it?
[3441.06 → 3441.88] I exaggerate.
[3441.96 → 3442.08] Very.
[3442.32 → 3442.58] Doing it.
[3442.82 → 3443.12] Oh!
[3446.00 → 3446.52] Hold on.
[3446.52 → 3446.88] It's like,
[3447.00 → 3448.58] it's like way in the video
[3448.58 → 3449.54] for some reason.
[3449.74 → 3450.32] My sweaty.
[3451.04 → 3451.76] Here we go.
[3451.82 → 3452.20] Here we go.
[3452.24 → 3452.56] Here we go.
[3452.60 → 3452.90] Here we go.
[3452.94 → 3453.26] Here we go.
[3453.32 → 3453.62] Here we go.
[3453.62 → 3453.64] Here we go.
[3453.64 → 3454.14] Chairs,
[3454.22 → 3454.82] and whoever wins
[3454.82 → 3455.46] is going to get
[3455.46 → 3456.64] something.
[3456.92 → 3457.54] It's going to be great.
[3457.92 → 3458.10] So,
[3458.28 → 3458.68] yeah,
[3458.68 → 3459.44] that's pretty much it.
[3459.48 → 3459.78] You know it.
[3460.24 → 3460.64] Whoa!
[3463.34 → 3464.44] Almost a collision.
[3466.24 → 3467.10] That was a thing.
[3467.10 → 3467.90] Oh my goodness.
[3468.34 → 3469.32] Terrifying.
[3469.64 → 3470.88] Neither James nor I
[3470.88 → 3471.74] saw each other coming.
[3473.22 → 3473.70] Yeah.
[3474.30 → 3474.78] So,
[3474.94 → 3475.64] we've got an episode
[3475.64 → 3478.52] comparing a $60 CPU
[3478.52 → 3480.70] to a $600 CPU.
[3481.60 → 3483.02] And the comparison
[3483.02 → 3484.24] is less stupid
[3484.24 → 3484.80] than you would
[3484.80 → 3485.58] probably think.
[3486.16 → 3486.92] We've got a tech
[3486.92 → 3487.22] quickie,
[3487.28 → 3487.98] avoiding common
[3487.98 → 3489.02] PC building traps,
[3489.12 → 3489.96] episode four.
[3490.70 → 3491.82] We've got three
[3491.82 → 3493.50] reasons not to buy
[3493.50 → 3494.98] this $400 laptop.
[3496.58 → 3498.12] Dell is not going
[3498.12 → 3498.54] to be stoked
[3498.54 → 3499.12] on that one.
[3499.30 → 3499.62] Oh,
[3499.98 → 3501.06] that's fun.
[3501.20 → 3502.00] I'm excited for that.
[3502.00 → 3503.52] We've got the
[3503.52 → 3505.12] 1920x1080
[3505.12 → 3505.92] meme PC.
[3506.18 → 3506.40] Oh,
[3506.48 → 3507.32] we built it.
[3508.20 → 3508.56] Oh,
[3508.68 → 3509.34] that's funny.
[3509.60 → 3509.96] We did.
[3510.12 → 3510.46] Oh,
[3510.54 → 3511.52] we definitely did it.
[3511.68 → 3513.64] The 1920x1080.
[3514.26 → 3515.04] Try and figure out
[3515.04 → 3515.52] what hardware
[3515.52 → 3516.52] that's in there,
[3516.60 → 3516.78] baby.
[3516.98 → 3517.40] Can I give them
[3517.40 → 3517.76] a hint?
[3518.24 → 3518.64] Sure.
[3519.00 → 3520.00] It came from
[3520.00 → 3520.78] a Reddit thread
[3520.78 → 3522.74] from a while ago.
[3522.90 → 3523.06] Yeah.
[3523.18 → 3524.26] Someone tagged me in it
[3524.26 → 3524.86] and they were like,
[3524.92 → 3525.92] if anyone's going to do it,
[3525.94 → 3526.58] it's you guys.
[3527.00 → 3528.00] And I forwarded it to Linus
[3528.00 → 3528.56] and was like,
[3529.38 → 3530.10] decent idea.
[3530.10 → 3531.12] Kind of dumb idea,
[3531.24 → 3531.52] but.
[3531.90 → 3532.30] But.
[3532.66 → 3533.10] But.
[3533.20 → 3534.10] It's also us.
[3534.12 → 3534.92] Let's do it.
[3534.94 → 3535.96] It's our kind of dumb idea.
[3536.96 → 3538.08] This actually ended up
[3538.08 → 3538.74] being a far more
[3538.74 → 3539.58] informative video
[3539.58 → 3540.58] than you'd probably think.
[3542.94 → 3544.30] LTT MacBook Pro stands.
[3544.74 → 3544.94] Oh,
[3545.00 → 3545.16] okay.
[3545.38 → 3546.34] Most of them suck.
[3546.56 → 3547.60] So we figured out
[3547.60 → 3548.26] which ones suck
[3548.26 → 3548.88] and which ones are
[3548.88 → 3549.50] actually decent,
[3549.60 → 3550.48] which is good because
[3550.48 → 3551.22] even if you don't have
[3551.22 → 3551.74] a MacBook Pro.
[3551.94 → 3552.08] You can use them
[3552.08 → 3552.76] for other laptops.
[3552.94 → 3553.24] You can use them
[3553.24 → 3553.80] for any laptop.
[3553.98 → 3554.12] Yep.
[3554.94 → 3555.66] Organization vlog,
[3555.76 → 3556.28] day three,
[3556.42 → 3557.78] the finale is up.
[3557.78 → 3560.70] And what else we got?
[3561.34 → 3561.52] Yeah,
[3561.56 → 3562.24] I think that's,
[3562.24 → 3563.48] I think that's pretty much it.
[3563.60 → 3563.72] Yeah.
[3563.82 → 3564.24] There might be,
[3564.28 → 3564.86] there might be like
[3564.86 → 3565.84] one more on here
[3565.84 → 3566.76] because we,
[3566.82 → 3568.26] we released Note 8
[3568.26 → 3568.88] simultaneously.
[3569.38 → 3570.42] So there's probably
[3570.42 → 3571.22] something here
[3571.22 → 3572.22] that I'm not seeing,
[3572.42 → 3574.34] but yeah,
[3574.50 → 3575.36] that's pretty much it.
[3576.12 → 3579.06] So thank you guys
[3579.06 → 3579.76] for tuning into
[3579.76 → 3580.46] the WAN show.
[3580.58 → 3582.12] We've got a great show
[3582.12 → 3583.14] for you next week.
[3583.54 → 3584.32] Same bat time,
[3584.44 → 3585.18] same bat channel.
[3585.88 → 3586.76] I'm tired.
[3586.76 → 3589.30] I'm like actually tired.
[3589.40 → 3589.58] You know,
[3589.76 → 3590.94] this week has been
[3590.94 → 3593.08] more frustrating
[3593.08 → 3594.14] than usual.
[3594.82 → 3596.36] So I,
[3596.36 → 3597.52] I had the whole thing
[3597.52 → 3599.72] where I unwisely,
[3599.90 → 3600.36] I admit,
[3600.56 → 3601.54] decided to put
[3601.54 → 3602.42] not clickbait
[3602.42 → 3603.14] in a title
[3603.14 → 3604.00] on one of our videos.
[3604.22 → 3604.34] Yeah.
[3605.02 → 3606.06] It wasn't clickbait.
[3607.14 → 3607.66] I,
[3607.84 → 3608.00] I don't,
[3608.14 → 3609.04] but people hate that,
[3609.12 → 3610.40] but people hate that.
[3610.54 → 3611.44] And they,
[3611.44 → 3612.14] that's like
[3612.14 → 3613.84] some Paul or stuff
[3613.84 → 3614.28] right there.
[3614.32 → 3615.12] They got some,
[3615.22 → 3615.62] they got,
[3615.62 → 3616.66] they got consumed
[3616.66 → 3617.80] by the hating that
[3617.80 → 3618.74] and sort of
[3618.74 → 3619.32] completely ignored
[3619.32 → 3619.76] the video.
[3619.88 → 3620.16] I'm assuming.
[3620.48 → 3621.52] Missed the satire
[3621.52 → 3622.30] and missed that
[3622.30 → 3623.74] it was not clickbait.
[3624.54 → 3624.98] Um,
[3625.62 → 3626.18] and then,
[3626.32 → 3628.08] and then there was like,
[3628.28 → 3629.28] like after that,
[3629.38 → 3629.96] there were people
[3629.96 → 3631.06] talking about how
[3631.06 → 3631.68] clickbait,
[3631.80 → 3632.36] the title of
[3632.36 → 3633.44] the next day's video,
[3633.88 → 3634.96] this Hyperloop pod
[3634.96 → 3636.26] has real hover engines.
[3636.52 → 3637.36] There's not clickbait
[3637.36 → 3637.86] at all
[3637.86 → 3639.20] because it's a Hyperloop pod
[3639.20 → 3640.46] and it has hover engines
[3640.46 → 3641.12] and they're real.
[3641.12 → 3642.14] Um,
[3642.32 → 3642.84] and then there were
[3642.84 → 3643.22] all the people
[3643.22 → 3643.88] kind of missing
[3643.88 → 3644.92] the point of the Hyperloop
[3644.92 → 3645.28] video.
[3645.80 → 3646.20] Basically,
[3646.20 → 3647.04] people were mad
[3647.04 → 3649.04] because Hyperloop
[3649.04 → 3649.74] are not practical
[3649.74 → 3651.98] and they sort of
[3651.98 → 3652.72] missed the part
[3652.72 → 3653.42] where it's an
[3653.42 → 3654.58] engineering competition
[3654.58 → 3655.12] and...
[3656.14 → 3656.56] This isn't like
[3656.56 → 3657.18] a government
[3657.18 → 3659.02] installing a
[3659.02 → 3660.54] nationwide train system.
[3662.04 → 3662.26] This is,
[3662.30 → 3662.96] so I haven't read
[3662.96 → 3663.44] the comments,
[3663.70 → 3664.10] but like,
[3664.22 → 3665.34] let's just address
[3665.34 → 3666.14] that for a moment.
[3667.50 → 3667.94] Like,
[3668.06 → 3668.94] if this is the
[3668.94 → 3669.48] U.S. government
[3669.48 → 3670.38] trying to install
[3670.38 → 3671.04] train systems
[3671.04 → 3672.12] across the entire
[3672.12 → 3672.72] country...
[3672.72 → 3673.38] And forcing you
[3673.38 → 3673.90] to ride them.
[3674.04 → 3674.90] And forcing you
[3674.90 → 3675.54] to ride them.
[3675.90 → 3676.58] And pay for them.
[3677.00 → 3677.84] And pay for them.
[3678.36 → 3678.98] Then you can,
[3678.98 → 3679.20] like,
[3679.34 → 3679.96] debate about how
[3679.96 → 3680.74] practical they are.
[3680.82 → 3681.22] This was an
[3681.22 → 3682.02] engineering competition.
[3682.34 → 3683.12] And it was
[3683.12 → 3684.08] privately hosted
[3684.08 → 3685.38] and...
[3685.38 → 3686.04] So why the hell
[3686.04 → 3686.62] do you care?
[3686.86 → 3687.62] I mean,
[3687.72 → 3688.06] you can,
[3688.18 → 3688.92] if you really,
[3689.12 → 3689.64] really want to
[3689.64 → 3690.58] get pedantic about it,
[3690.60 → 3691.34] you can talk about
[3691.34 → 3692.38] how Elon Musk
[3692.38 → 3693.12] has gotten a lot
[3693.12 → 3694.02] of government funding.
[3695.40 → 3695.60] Yeah,
[3695.82 → 3696.24] because he's done
[3696.24 → 3697.28] a lot of awesome stuff.
[3697.28 → 3697.88] Um,
[3698.10 → 3698.62] uh,
[3698.78 → 3699.42] and,
[3699.54 → 3700.12] et cetera,
[3700.20 → 3700.58] et cetera.
[3700.96 → 3701.76] But basically,
[3701.76 → 3702.38] that was really
[3702.38 → 3702.86] frustrating.
[3703.14 → 3703.64] There's been a lot
[3703.64 → 3704.14] of hate on the
[3704.14 → 3704.94] tech quickie intro.
[3705.12 → 3705.90] Someone in the chat
[3705.90 → 3706.08] said,
[3706.14 → 3706.76] Luke's disappointed
[3706.76 → 3707.14] in us.
[3707.22 → 3708.06] I kind of am.
[3708.18 → 3708.86] I come from a
[3708.86 → 3709.56] science-y background
[3709.56 → 3710.24] and you have to
[3710.24 → 3710.92] try things.
[3711.44 → 3712.30] You constantly
[3712.30 → 3713.26] have to try things.
[3713.26 → 3714.06] And if you look
[3714.06 → 3714.44] at, like,
[3715.04 → 3715.52] the different
[3715.52 → 3716.38] technologies that
[3716.38 → 3716.86] have come out
[3716.86 → 3718.30] of NASA research,
[3718.36 → 3718.86] for instance,
[3719.14 → 3719.90] a lot of the times
[3719.90 → 3720.36] it's,
[3720.56 → 3721.46] you try something
[3721.46 → 3722.72] and you go like,
[3722.80 → 3723.24] oh, okay,
[3723.40 → 3723.54] well,
[3723.60 → 3724.30] maybe our
[3724.30 → 3725.64] actual main goal
[3725.64 → 3726.90] wasn't,
[3728.02 → 3728.90] it wasn't
[3728.90 → 3729.46] realized.
[3730.10 → 3730.20] Yeah.
[3730.22 → 3730.76] But through
[3730.76 → 3731.28] messing with
[3731.28 → 3731.98] these magnets
[3731.98 → 3733.50] and trying to
[3733.50 → 3735.22] cool down stuff
[3735.22 → 3735.86] that doesn't have
[3735.86 → 3737.04] air flowing by it
[3737.04 → 3738.58] and trying to,
[3738.58 → 3739.16] uh,
[3739.24 → 3740.52] elevate really,
[3740.68 → 3741.46] really heavy objects
[3741.46 → 3741.88] and move them
[3741.88 → 3742.10] really,
[3742.22 → 3742.72] really quick on
[3742.72 → 3743.00] magnets,
[3743.00 → 3744.02] we learned weird
[3744.02 → 3744.88] things about,
[3745.08 → 3745.76] I don't know,
[3745.80 → 3746.22] I'm going to pull
[3746.22 → 3746.76] a bunch of stuff
[3746.76 → 3747.28] out of my butt,
[3747.44 → 3748.28] superconductors
[3748.28 → 3748.88] or,
[3748.88 → 3749.44] or,
[3749.64 → 3750.70] or cooling things
[3750.70 → 3751.48] without air
[3751.48 → 3751.66] and,
[3751.74 → 3751.80] like,
[3751.84 → 3752.22] all this other
[3752.22 → 3752.60] kind of stuff
[3752.60 → 3753.06] that becomes
[3753.06 → 3753.82] helpful in other
[3753.82 → 3754.32] areas.
[3754.32 → 3756.04] Doing things
[3756.04 → 3757.26] because of
[3757.26 → 3758.48] learning is
[3758.48 → 3759.26] a very good
[3759.26 → 3759.56] thing,
[3759.72 → 3759.92] so,
[3760.32 → 3760.60] shush.
[3760.80 → 3761.08] So,
[3761.20 → 3761.52] I thought it
[3761.52 → 3761.86] was a really
[3761.86 → 3762.38] cool piece
[3762.38 → 3762.96] and basically
[3762.96 → 3763.94] people kind of
[3763.94 → 3764.66] crapped on it
[3764.66 → 3765.08] and I was just
[3765.08 → 3765.32] like,
[3765.40 → 3765.64] well,
[3766.10 → 3766.84] I feel like
[3766.84 → 3767.20] some of it
[3767.20 → 3767.60] was just
[3767.60 → 3768.30] that there's
[3768.30 → 3769.16] some negative
[3769.16 → 3769.62] sentiment
[3769.62 → 3771.34] out there
[3771.34 → 3771.72] and I think
[3771.72 → 3772.08] people were
[3772.08 → 3772.34] kind of
[3772.34 → 3773.00] finding something
[3773.00 → 3773.54] to get upset
[3773.54 → 3773.74] about.
[3773.82 → 3773.96] That makes
[3773.96 → 3774.24] sense.
[3774.46 → 3775.34] I also think
[3775.34 → 3776.02] that there's
[3776.02 → 3776.92] a lot of,
[3777.04 → 3777.36] um,
[3778.22 → 3779.68] I think that
[3779.68 → 3780.00] a lot of
[3780.00 → 3780.70] people feel,
[3780.94 → 3782.00] felt like they
[3782.00 → 3782.70] were being sold
[3782.70 → 3783.22] something,
[3783.38 → 3783.84] even though
[3783.84 → 3784.44] they weren't.
[3785.00 → 3785.28] They were
[3785.28 → 3785.54] like,
[3785.64 → 3786.16] this isn't
[3786.16 → 3786.32] gonna,
[3786.48 → 3786.64] like,
[3786.98 → 3787.26] okay,
[3787.40 → 3788.16] so a lot
[3788.16 → 3788.42] of people
[3788.42 → 3789.06] drew parallels
[3789.06 → 3789.80] between the
[3789.80 → 3790.32] Hyperloop
[3790.32 → 3790.86] and,
[3791.06 → 3791.18] like,
[3791.22 → 3791.62] the Hyperloop
[3791.62 → 3792.14] competition
[3792.14 → 3792.82] video we
[3792.82 → 3793.86] made and
[3793.86 → 3794.34] something like
[3794.34 → 3794.70] the Solar
[3794.70 → 3795.04] Freaking
[3795.04 → 3795.54] Roadways
[3795.54 → 3795.94] video.
[3796.58 → 3797.26] But the
[3797.26 → 3798.18] difference is
[3798.18 → 3798.62] that nobody
[3798.62 → 3799.24] is asking
[3799.24 → 3799.70] for your
[3799.70 → 3799.96] money,
[3800.96 → 3801.74] so that's
[3801.74 → 3802.44] one huge
[3802.44 → 3802.82] difference.
[3802.94 → 3803.22] And was
[3803.22 → 3803.66] that not?
[3804.34 → 3805.52] No one's asking
[3805.52 → 3805.58] to spend anything.
[3805.58 → 3805.76] So they're
[3805.76 → 3805.98] like,
[3806.18 → 3806.64] debunked,
[3806.74 → 3807.36] debunked,
[3807.90 → 3808.60] and it's
[3808.60 → 3808.80] like,
[3809.00 → 3809.62] debunked in
[3809.62 → 3810.94] a tone that
[3810.94 → 3811.32] was like,
[3811.32 → 3812.26] don't buy
[3812.26 → 3812.48] this,
[3812.52 → 3812.82] it's been
[3812.82 → 3813.38] debunked.
[3813.56 → 3814.14] But no one's
[3814.14 → 3814.82] asking you to
[3814.82 → 3815.44] buy anything.
[3815.94 → 3816.54] It's just,
[3816.98 → 3817.70] it's just,
[3817.84 → 3818.70] it's a science
[3818.70 → 3819.38] competition.
[3819.70 → 3820.16] So I feel
[3820.16 → 3820.60] like people
[3820.60 → 3820.94] were,
[3821.20 → 3821.92] people had
[3821.92 → 3822.50] sort of,
[3822.50 → 3823.26] like a personal
[3823.26 → 3824.80] investment in,
[3825.00 → 3825.66] you know,
[3825.72 → 3826.52] trying to save
[3826.52 → 3827.08] other people
[3827.08 → 3827.94] from this thing
[3827.94 → 3828.36] that's really
[3828.36 → 3828.80] bad,
[3829.28 → 3830.24] when actually
[3830.24 → 3832.20] nobody is,
[3833.12 → 3833.48] nobody,
[3833.62 → 3833.88] then they're
[3833.88 → 3834.12] like,
[3834.30 → 3834.46] yeah,
[3834.54 → 3834.88] and the hyper,
[3835.00 → 3835.52] like this one
[3835.52 → 3836.10] comment was
[3836.10 → 3837.12] particularly ignorant.
[3837.50 → 3837.96] And they're
[3837.96 → 3838.76] building it in
[3838.76 → 3839.72] California in one
[3839.72 → 3840.06] of the most
[3840.06 → 3840.98] earthquake prone
[3840.98 → 3841.70] areas in the
[3841.70 → 3842.02] world.
[3842.74 → 3843.78] Nobody is
[3843.78 → 3844.36] building it
[3844.36 → 3845.02] anywhere,
[3845.28 → 3845.94] because it
[3845.94 → 3846.62] isn't a thing.
[3848.18 → 3848.72] It's an
[3848.72 → 3849.08] engineering
[3849.08 → 3849.92] competition right
[3849.92 → 3850.32] now,
[3850.42 → 3850.82] so that we
[3850.82 → 3851.12] can like,
[3851.18 → 3851.50] learn some
[3851.50 → 3851.84] stuff.
[3852.14 → 3852.66] And weren't
[3852.66 → 3852.98] they just,
[3853.08 → 3853.28] okay,
[3853.34 → 3853.78] I don't know,
[3853.86 → 3854.10] but weren't
[3854.10 → 3854.34] they just
[3854.34 → 3854.74] making the
[3854.74 → 3854.98] sled?
[3856.14 → 3856.56] Yeah,
[3856.60 → 3856.80] they were
[3856.80 → 3857.34] just making
[3857.34 → 3857.90] pods.
[3858.16 → 3858.36] Yeah.
[3858.48 → 3858.80] And then they
[3858.80 → 3859.20] had a one
[3859.20 → 3859.76] mile test
[3859.76 → 3860.40] track that
[3860.40 → 3861.00] some teams
[3861.00 → 3861.52] got to go
[3861.52 → 3861.86] down as
[3861.86 → 3862.22] fast as
[3862.22 → 3862.50] they could.
[3862.80 → 3863.10] Yeah.
[3863.72 → 3864.02] Yeah.
[3866.76 → 3867.20] Anyway.
[3867.76 → 3868.58] So that's
[3868.58 → 3868.86] where we're
[3868.86 → 3869.10] at.
[3869.72 → 3871.64] And then
[3871.64 → 3872.88] the Note 8
[3872.88 → 3873.92] video had an
[3873.92 → 3874.50] error in it.
[3874.50 → 3875.66] And we had
[3875.66 → 3876.04] to pull it
[3876.04 → 3876.46] down.
[3876.56 → 3877.06] Even if it
[3877.06 → 3878.00] was debunked,
[3878.00 → 3878.74] I don't know,
[3879.02 → 3879.58] but even if,
[3879.68 → 3880.26] or if part of
[3880.26 → 3880.88] it was debunked,
[3880.94 → 3881.32] whatever.
[3882.20 → 3882.84] That's the
[3882.84 → 3883.52] point of
[3883.52 → 3884.14] science.
[3884.84 → 3884.96] Like,
[3885.10 → 3885.70] parts of it
[3885.70 → 3886.50] are thoroughly
[3886.50 → 3887.42] debunked.
[3887.54 → 3887.94] Great.
[3888.16 → 3889.68] But no one
[3889.68 → 3890.38] is trying to
[3890.38 → 3890.86] build that.
[3890.98 → 3891.10] Like,
[3891.16 → 3892.00] there's a lot
[3892.00 → 3892.20] of us,
[3892.24 → 3892.72] I talked about
[3892.72 → 3893.06] this a little
[3893.06 → 3893.46] bit last
[3893.46 → 3893.70] night,
[3893.86 → 3895.76] but it
[3895.76 → 3896.34] seems like the
[3896.34 → 3897.06] people crying
[3897.06 → 3897.96] debunked are
[3897.96 → 3898.96] assuming that
[3898.96 → 3899.94] all the
[3899.94 → 3901.00] scientists and
[3901.00 → 3901.90] engineers at
[3901.90 → 3902.66] SpaceX and
[3902.66 → 3902.92] all these
[3902.92 → 3904.50] universities haven't
[3904.50 → 3905.34] taken a grade
[3905.34 → 3906.16] 11 physics
[3906.16 → 3906.50] course.
[3907.74 → 3908.38] Like,
[3908.52 → 3909.38] they're not
[3909.38 → 3910.34] aware that
[3910.34 → 3911.48] sudden decompression
[3911.48 → 3912.16] due to,
[3912.24 → 3912.38] like,
[3912.46 → 3913.28] a bullet hole
[3913.28 → 3914.04] in the
[3914.04 → 3914.88] Hyperloop tube
[3914.88 → 3915.62] would be bad.
[3915.62 → 3920.34] my biggest
[3920.34 → 3920.66] thing is,
[3920.76 → 3920.82] like,
[3920.86 → 3921.50] trying things
[3921.50 → 3922.02] and failing
[3922.02 → 3922.46] and then
[3922.46 → 3923.22] trying again
[3923.22 → 3924.24] and with
[3924.24 → 3925.94] knowing how
[3925.94 → 3926.52] and why you
[3926.52 → 3927.04] failed and
[3927.04 → 3927.62] growing from
[3927.62 → 3928.14] there is,
[3928.32 → 3928.36] like,
[3928.44 → 3928.94] literally the
[3928.94 → 3929.40] whole point.
[3929.66 → 3930.44] And retesting
[3930.44 → 3931.04] things and
[3931.04 → 3931.64] other people
[3931.64 → 3932.60] challenging your
[3932.60 → 3933.08] claims and
[3933.08 → 3933.36] all that kind
[3933.36 → 3933.78] of stuff is
[3933.78 → 3934.50] how science
[3934.50 → 3934.96] worked.
[3935.46 → 3935.56] So,
[3935.80 → 3936.80] debunked,
[3936.84 → 3938.50] is completely
[3938.50 → 3939.14] unhelpful.
[3939.58 → 3939.72] Yeah.
[3939.88 → 3940.10] Going,
[3940.24 → 3940.36] oh,
[3940.42 → 3940.68] look,
[3940.84 → 3942.16] I theorized
[3942.16 → 3942.76] these things
[3942.76 → 3943.18] and I think
[3943.18 → 3943.52] you're wrong
[3943.52 → 3943.94] because of
[3943.94 → 3944.64] this data and
[3944.64 → 3945.28] I think this
[3945.28 → 3945.70] is interesting
[3945.70 → 3946.18] because whatever,
[3946.60 → 3946.92] great.
[3947.48 → 3948.50] At risk of
[3948.50 → 3949.04] getting a little
[3949.04 → 3949.90] offensive here,
[3950.04 → 3950.84] I feel like a lot
[3950.84 → 3951.32] of it is the
[3951.32 → 3951.94] science as a
[3951.94 → 3952.62] religion crowd
[3952.62 → 3953.58] where they just
[3953.58 → 3954.26] kind of go,
[3954.66 → 3954.98] you know,
[3955.62 → 3956.56] it's about,
[3956.74 → 3957.20] it becomes,
[3957.42 → 3957.94] like,
[3957.98 → 3958.52] a fanboy
[3958.52 → 3959.06] mentality.
[3959.50 → 3959.52] Like,
[3959.88 → 3960.40] I'm,
[3961.14 → 3961.50] I have to,
[3961.56 → 3961.86] I have to,
[3961.86 → 3962.06] like,
[3962.12 → 3962.84] defend this
[3962.84 → 3963.44] because,
[3963.62 → 3964.94] because science
[3964.94 → 3965.42] said it.
[3967.06 → 3967.88] And sometimes
[3967.88 → 3968.48] I feel like
[3968.48 → 3969.60] that gets,
[3970.38 → 3971.20] that energy
[3971.20 → 3971.88] gets channelled
[3971.88 → 3972.22] in the wrong
[3972.22 → 3972.68] direction a little bit.
[3972.68 → 3973.00] those people
[3973.00 → 3974.98] think they
[3974.98 → 3975.46] really like
[3975.46 → 3976.18] science and
[3976.18 → 3976.60] it's really
[3976.60 → 3976.94] that they
[3976.94 → 3977.38] just really
[3977.38 → 3977.94] don't like
[3977.94 → 3979.06] other things
[3979.06 → 3980.26] and they
[3980.26 → 3980.72] forget that
[3980.72 → 3981.18] the scientific
[3981.18 → 3981.74] method is
[3981.74 → 3982.40] rather important.
[3983.44 → 3983.94] I'm gonna
[3983.94 → 3984.48] address one
[3984.48 → 3984.96] comment here
[3984.96 → 3985.36] really quick.
[3985.58 → 3985.70] Yeah.
[3986.46 → 3987.14] ECU underscore
[3987.14 → 3988.30] 55 said,
[3988.40 → 3988.88] we just want
[3988.88 → 3989.12] reviews,
[3989.18 → 3989.80] in all capital
[3989.80 → 3990.08] letters,
[3990.18 → 3990.38] mind you,
[3990.54 → 3991.18] we just want
[3991.18 → 3991.60] reviews,
[3991.74 → 3992.16] dot dot dot,
[3992.24 → 3992.94] people are tired
[3992.94 → 3993.52] of clickbait.
[3993.62 → 3993.98] None of these
[3993.98 → 3994.34] things have been
[3994.34 → 3994.76] clickbait.
[3995.14 → 3995.64] You're just tired
[3995.64 → 3996.18] of content that
[3996.18 → 3996.78] you don't want.
[3997.72 → 3998.20] There's a difference.
[3998.20 → 3998.76] What should I
[3998.76 → 3999.12] review?
[4000.48 → 4000.70] Yeah,
[4000.78 → 4001.64] what's happening
[4001.64 → 4002.32] in the computer
[4002.32 → 4002.88] world right now
[4002.88 → 4003.56] that has you
[4003.56 → 4005.28] raring to go?
[4005.44 → 4005.98] You've got a
[4005.98 → 4006.62] review of
[4006.62 → 4007.26] everything that
[4007.26 → 4007.98] mattered in the
[4007.98 → 4008.36] last,
[4008.94 → 4009.32] I don't know,
[4009.38 → 4009.78] we've got a
[4009.78 → 4010.34] review of the
[4010.34 → 4010.74] Node 8,
[4010.98 → 4012.14] we've got a
[4012.14 → 4013.76] review of all
[4013.76 → 4014.80] three variants of
[4014.80 → 4015.26] Ry zen,
[4015.52 → 4016.30] four including
[4016.30 → 4016.82] Thread ripper,
[4017.54 → 4018.20] we've got a
[4018.20 → 4019.28] review of the
[4019.28 → 4020.22] Scientology is
[4020.22 → 4021.02] not science as
[4021.02 → 4021.40] a religion,
[4021.58 → 4022.24] oh my god,
[4022.50 → 4022.78] sorry.
[4023.24 → 4023.76] Wow.
[4023.76 → 4027.38] That's a
[4027.38 → 4027.78] completely
[4027.78 → 4028.38] indifferent.
[4028.52 → 4029.24] So science as
[4029.24 → 4030.20] a religion is
[4030.20 → 4031.04] taking a faith
[4031.04 → 4031.76] based approach
[4031.76 → 4032.62] to science
[4032.62 → 4033.72] and basically
[4033.72 → 4035.86] treating something
[4035.86 → 4036.86] science-y that
[4036.86 → 4037.82] somebody told you
[4037.82 → 4039.00] as fact without
[4039.00 → 4040.18] worrying much
[4040.18 → 4040.88] about the
[4040.88 → 4042.24] method by which
[4042.24 → 4043.50] we arrived
[4043.50 → 4043.78] there.
[4043.84 → 4044.88] When like what
[4044.88 → 4045.68] science is built
[4045.68 → 4047.08] on is questioning
[4047.08 → 4047.98] things and trying
[4047.98 → 4049.64] things and looking
[4049.64 → 4050.46] more deeply into
[4050.46 → 4050.70] stuff.
[4051.74 → 4052.44] That's what we
[4052.44 → 4053.06] mean by that.
[4053.12 → 4053.64] It has nothing
[4053.64 → 4054.72] at all to do
[4054.72 → 4055.48] with Scientology.
[4055.88 → 4057.22] Scientology is
[4057.22 → 4057.64] a cult.
[4059.42 → 4059.94] Boom.
[4060.38 → 4061.34] I support that.
[4063.16 → 4064.40] What was I
[4064.40 → 4064.80] talking about
[4064.80 → 4065.36] before that
[4065.36 → 4065.58] though?
[4065.76 → 4066.12] It seemed
[4066.12 → 4066.46] important.
[4066.66 → 4066.88] Sorry.
[4067.52 → 4067.84] I don't
[4067.84 → 4068.16] remember.
[4072.52 → 4073.04] Right,
[4073.16 → 4073.34] yeah,
[4073.42 → 4073.72] what are we
[4073.72 → 4074.16] supposed to
[4074.16 → 4074.44] review?
[4074.90 → 4075.96] Are we
[4075.96 → 4076.54] supposed to
[4076.54 → 4077.20] review like
[4077.20 → 4077.84] yet another
[4077.84 → 4078.16] motherboard?
[4078.16 → 4078.68] We jumped
[4078.68 → 4079.48] on everything
[4079.48 → 4079.98] that's come
[4079.98 → 4080.42] out lately
[4080.42 → 4081.44] super hard.
[4081.96 → 4082.18] I mean,
[4082.28 → 4083.04] I know there's
[4083.04 → 4083.56] people out
[4083.56 → 4083.94] there that
[4083.94 → 4084.42] really do
[4084.42 → 4084.76] want us
[4084.76 → 4085.20] to review
[4085.20 → 4085.64] a motherboard,
[4085.84 → 4086.20] but what
[4086.20 → 4087.00] exactly would
[4087.00 → 4087.38] you expect
[4087.38 → 4087.90] us to say
[4087.90 → 4088.32] about it?
[4088.82 → 4089.36] It's pretty
[4089.36 → 4089.62] good,
[4089.70 → 4089.86] man.
[4090.60 → 4091.22] Seems okay.
[4091.30 → 4091.74] It's got
[4091.74 → 4092.70] two RGB
[4092.70 → 4093.14] headers.
[4094.14 → 4094.80] This is where
[4094.80 → 4095.30] all the fan
[4095.30 → 4095.92] spots are.
[4096.06 → 4096.80] It's unboxing
[4096.80 → 4097.46] at that point.
[4098.20 → 4098.64] Honestly,
[4099.00 → 4099.66] I have a
[4099.66 → 4099.92] motherboard
[4099.92 → 4100.62] review coming
[4100.62 → 4101.56] sometime in
[4101.56 → 4102.04] the next few
[4102.04 → 4102.34] weeks.
[4103.16 → 4103.88] It'll be
[4103.88 → 4104.70] As rock's
[4104.70 → 4105.62] X299
[4105.62 → 4106.68] Mini IT
[4106.68 → 4107.56] board because
[4107.56 → 4108.82] that is
[4108.82 → 4109.34] freaking
[4109.34 → 4109.78] cool.
[4111.22 → 4112.22] But the
[4112.22 → 4113.46] way to
[4113.46 → 4114.50] Sorry,
[4114.62 → 4114.92] someone in
[4114.92 → 4115.30] the chat,
[4115.58 → 4116.56] it's blue.
[4119.92 → 4120.90] Except when
[4120.90 → 4122.28] I change it
[4122.28 → 4122.58] to red.
[4123.46 → 4123.66] Yeah.
[4126.24 → 4127.78] So that
[4127.78 → 4128.32] one's freaking
[4128.32 → 4128.78] cool.
[4128.78 → 4129.84] And whenever
[4129.84 → 4131.12] something freaking
[4131.12 → 4132.20] cool shows up,
[4132.60 → 4133.82] I'm amped.
[4133.84 → 4134.22] I'm going to
[4134.22 → 4134.84] jump on it.
[4134.84 → 4135.60] Another
[4135.60 → 4136.00] motherboard
[4136.00 → 4136.88] video that
[4136.88 → 4137.34] I'm going to
[4137.34 → 4137.80] have coming
[4137.80 → 4138.46] hopefully in
[4138.46 → 4138.70] the next
[4138.70 → 4139.86] little bit is
[4139.86 → 4140.60] Asus released
[4140.60 → 4141.08] a board with
[4141.08 → 4142.04] 19 PCI
[4142.04 → 4142.70] express slots.
[4143.38 → 4143.46] Dude,
[4143.50 → 4144.08] that's crazy.
[4144.18 → 4144.38] Yeah.
[4144.94 → 4145.72] That's cool.
[4145.88 → 4146.72] That's different.
[4146.82 → 4147.08] And that's
[4147.08 → 4147.56] something like,
[4147.98 → 4148.64] even then,
[4148.70 → 4149.10] it's not
[4149.10 → 4149.76] unboxing because
[4149.76 → 4150.06] we're just
[4150.06 → 4150.30] going to have
[4150.30 → 4150.96] to find some
[4150.96 → 4151.40] weird way to
[4151.40 → 4151.86] do something
[4151.86 → 4152.02] with it.
[4152.02 → 4152.16] Yeah,
[4152.30 → 4152.52] well,
[4152.62 → 4153.16] some kind of
[4153.16 → 4153.82] mining application
[4153.82 → 4154.16] or something.
[4154.26 → 4154.44] We'll hook
[4154.44 → 4155.30] 19 GPUs up
[4155.30 → 4155.66] to it and
[4155.66 → 4156.16] go to town.
[4157.14 → 4157.54] But that's
[4157.54 → 4157.80] something
[4157.80 → 4158.60] interesting enough
[4158.60 → 4159.24] to do
[4159.24 → 4159.74] something with.
[4159.76 → 4160.02] But that's
[4160.02 → 4160.34] the thing is,
[4160.38 → 4160.92] you guys got to
[4160.92 → 4161.28] understand,
[4161.28 → 4162.72] I can't
[4162.72 → 4163.52] make a video
[4163.52 → 4164.68] that bores me.
[4165.04 → 4165.72] What is the
[4165.72 → 4166.10] point?
[4166.22 → 4166.74] Are you going
[4166.74 → 4167.32] to like it
[4167.32 → 4168.18] if I say
[4168.18 → 4168.86] the same
[4168.86 → 4170.12] thing that
[4170.12 → 4171.04] I'm always
[4171.04 → 4171.50] saying?
[4173.44 → 4174.72] What are the
[4174.72 → 4175.14] features of
[4175.14 → 4175.60] this motherboard?
[4176.30 → 4176.94] What are the
[4176.94 → 4177.50] features of a
[4177.50 → 4177.80] motherboard?
[4178.18 → 4179.36] It fits the
[4179.36 → 4180.12] other stuff
[4180.12 → 4180.76] that you can
[4180.76 → 4182.74] buy and
[4182.74 → 4183.38] connects it
[4183.38 → 4183.72] all.
[4184.38 → 4184.80] Also,
[4184.90 → 4185.32] it's got a
[4185.32 → 4185.90] great audio
[4185.90 → 4186.38] codec,
[4186.42 → 4186.72] which is
[4186.72 → 4187.16] important,
[4188.16 → 4188.98] and RGB
[4188.98 → 4189.32] lighting,
[4189.72 → 4190.40] which you may
[4190.40 → 4190.70] or may not
[4190.70 → 4190.98] think is
[4190.98 → 4191.34] important.
[4192.42 → 4192.76] But a
[4192.76 → 4193.86] huge amount
[4193.86 → 4194.24] of motherboard
[4194.24 → 4195.60] stuff you
[4195.60 → 4196.38] could find
[4196.38 → 4197.14] way more
[4197.14 → 4198.00] efficiently and
[4198.00 → 4198.54] in a better
[4198.54 → 4199.52] format by just
[4199.52 → 4200.06] looking at the
[4200.06 → 4200.58] spec sheet on
[4200.58 → 4200.88] the website.
[4200.92 → 4201.60] It's tough,
[4201.74 → 4201.80] too,
[4201.86 → 4202.36] because even
[4202.36 → 4202.98] a lot of
[4202.98 → 4204.24] non-IT
[4204.24 → 4204.72] stuff,
[4204.82 → 4205.20] like phone
[4205.20 → 4205.62] stuff,
[4205.96 → 4206.34] pretty
[4206.34 → 4207.14] consolidated.
[4208.32 → 4208.66] With
[4208.66 → 4210.02] manufacturers like
[4210.02 → 4211.34] HTC,
[4212.26 → 4213.54] Nokia released
[4213.54 → 4213.98] a thing that
[4213.98 → 4214.60] people seem to
[4214.60 → 4215.10] care about,
[4215.20 → 4216.12] LG's V30
[4216.12 → 4216.78] people seem to
[4216.78 → 4217.52] care about,
[4217.90 → 4218.30] but even
[4218.30 → 4219.08] Pixel 2,
[4219.22 → 4220.06] there's basically
[4220.06 → 4220.80] no hype.
[4221.40 → 4222.10] We're pretty
[4222.10 → 4223.04] much down to
[4223.04 → 4224.26] a half a dozen
[4224.26 → 4224.88] phone releases
[4224.88 → 4225.42] a year that
[4225.42 → 4226.20] anyone really
[4226.20 → 4226.84] cares about.
[4228.04 → 4229.08] Server stuff?
[4229.20 → 4229.44] No.
[4229.78 → 4230.16] No.
[4232.22 → 4233.28] Say what?
[4235.42 → 4236.36] It's got more
[4236.36 → 4237.20] cores than last
[4237.20 → 4238.92] year, which is
[4238.92 → 4239.54] good, which is
[4239.54 → 4240.20] cool, and if we
[4240.20 → 4241.02] find a cool
[4241.02 → 4241.94] application for it.
[4242.32 → 4243.50] Okay, again, I
[4243.50 → 4244.62] do have a plan
[4244.62 → 4245.74] with some of the
[4245.74 → 4246.64] more recent server
[4246.64 → 4246.94] stuff.
[4246.94 → 4248.04] I want to do
[4248.04 → 4248.52] something with
[4248.52 → 4250.06] AMD Epic where
[4250.06 → 4251.40] we do a half a
[4251.40 → 4252.00] dozen video
[4252.00 → 4253.00] editing workstations
[4253.00 → 4253.86] running off of a
[4253.86 → 4254.42] single tower.
[4255.18 → 4255.82] I think that would
[4255.82 → 4256.86] be super cool.
[4257.60 → 4258.34] There was a guy,
[4258.44 → 4259.22] by the way, at
[4259.22 → 4260.20] PAX BYOC.
[4260.52 → 4260.68] Yeah.
[4260.82 → 4261.36] I didn't ever
[4261.36 → 4262.32] get to meet him,
[4262.68 → 4263.26] but there's a guy
[4263.26 → 4264.20] there that's a fan
[4264.20 → 4265.16] of Linus Tech Tips
[4265.16 → 4266.32] and had one.
[4266.38 → 4267.00] I didn't notice it
[4267.00 → 4267.98] when I walked past.
[4268.08 → 4268.60] I was like, that's a
[4268.60 → 4269.14] very interesting
[4269.14 → 4270.22] computer, and kind
[4270.22 → 4270.72] of looked at it a
[4270.72 → 4271.28] little bit, but then
[4271.28 → 4272.16] just kept walking by.
[4272.50 → 4273.70] Didn't realize it
[4273.70 → 4275.12] was two setups in
[4275.12 → 4275.76] one tower.
[4275.76 → 4276.30] Nice.
[4276.40 → 4277.16] It was an Unpaid
[4277.16 → 4277.56] build.
[4277.86 → 4278.68] It was a beautiful
[4278.68 → 4279.76] black and green,
[4279.86 → 4280.44] which is not that
[4280.44 → 4281.08] common, so I love
[4281.08 → 4281.98] seeing them at LAN's.
[4282.26 → 4283.00] Black and green,
[4283.16 → 4283.98] beautiful looking
[4283.98 → 4285.34] Unpaid build with
[4285.34 → 4286.64] his system on one
[4286.64 → 4287.24] side of the table
[4287.24 → 4288.18] and someone else's
[4288.18 → 4288.74] on the other side
[4288.74 → 4289.16] of the table.
[4289.54 → 4289.94] Nice.
[4289.94 → 4290.86] It was really
[4290.86 → 4291.28] cool.
[4292.16 → 4293.18] And, yeah, I wish
[4293.18 → 4293.66] I actually got to
[4293.66 → 4294.08] talk to him.
[4295.08 → 4296.04] So, yeah, if we
[4296.04 → 4296.70] can find an
[4296.70 → 4297.62] application for it,
[4297.68 → 4298.32] like, I guarantee
[4298.32 → 4299.04] you something we're
[4299.04 → 4299.74] going to do with
[4299.74 → 4301.10] the upcoming Intel
[4301.10 → 4302.84] higher core count,
[4302.92 → 4303.46] high-end desktop
[4303.46 → 4305.16] parts, expect to
[4305.16 → 4306.84] see an Unpaid
[4306.84 → 4307.68] build where we
[4307.68 → 4308.38] do a streaming
[4308.38 → 4309.40] machine and the
[4309.40 → 4310.14] gaming machine that
[4310.14 → 4310.82] goes with it.
[4311.32 → 4312.32] Two discrete
[4312.32 → 4314.52] function machines
[4314.52 → 4315.50] in a single tower.
[4315.64 → 4316.30] Fire engine build.
[4317.30 → 4317.80] All right.
[4317.90 → 4318.32] So, thanks for
[4318.32 → 4319.04] watching, WAN Show.
[4319.12 → 4319.70] We'll see you again
[4319.70 → 4320.12] next week.
[4320.20 → 4320.90] Same bat time,
[4321.02 → 4321.82] same bat channel.
[4321.82 → 4322.22] Oh.
[4339.84 → 4340.62] Like, do more
[4340.62 → 4341.26] old stuff.
[4341.52 → 4342.18] Like, ugh.
[4342.68 → 4343.48] Okay, so the problem
[4343.48 → 4344.32] with old stuff is
[4344.32 → 4345.74] there's a finite amount
[4345.74 → 4346.22] of it.
[4346.38 → 4346.66] Yeah.
[4347.86 → 4348.88] Inherently, there is a
[4348.88 → 4349.34] finite amount of old stuff.
[4349.34 → 4350.40] There is, there will
[4350.40 → 4351.04] be more coming.
[4351.30 → 4352.12] Yeah, yeah, there's
[4352.12 → 4352.90] more old stuff coming
[4352.90 → 4353.32] all the time.
[4353.34 → 4353.84] There's a plan for, at
[4353.84 → 4354.98] the very least, one more.
[4355.12 → 4355.26] Yeah.
[4355.26 → 4355.52] But, like.
[4356.02 → 4356.70] And that'll be good.
[4357.00 → 4357.22] Yeah.
[4357.40 → 4357.72] All right.
[4358.08 → 4358.50] Thanks again.
