[1.00 --> 11.92]  And we are live! Welcome to the WAN show, you guys! It's got tech news, it's got guests, it's got everything except some kind of a coherent strategy today.
[12.00 --> 17.08]  Because I'm going to be totally honest with you guys. Okay, one thing. First things first. Hi, Justine.
[17.14 --> 17.46]  Hi!
[17.62 --> 18.46]  Welcome to the show.
[18.54 --> 19.24]  Thanks for having me.
[19.24 --> 27.90]  Yeah, it's absolutely my pleasure. This is actually our first time meeting. Even though she's been here all day, we actually have hardly interacted.
[27.90 --> 33.94]  I was like, are you sure he's here? Did I get tricked? Is this like some warehouse that I just showed up to? Is this how I die? I'm confused.
[34.52 --> 37.14]  At the very back of a working complex? Yeah.
[37.14 --> 38.40]  Just drive to the very end.
[38.78 --> 40.22]  Okay, in my defense.
[40.58 --> 41.10]  You're busy!
[41.34 --> 42.98]  It's not the least sketchy area.
[43.14 --> 44.06]  No, it's not. It's great.
[44.10 --> 50.16]  Wait. It's not the most sketchy area. It's also not the least sketchy area.
[50.18 --> 52.26]  I saw Starbucks on the way, so I felt at home.
[52.56 --> 52.96]  Right.
[52.98 --> 53.82]  There you go. Nice.
[53.82 --> 71.18]  So, she's here, and then we've also got Steven from Gamers Nexus and Riley slash Keys from NCI Tech Tips because Luke and I, along with our other special guests, I don't know if I'm going to bring you guys on the show because you guys are getting plenty of camera time, but get on here and kind of say hi.
[72.46 --> 74.12]  Are they being all camera shy?
[74.26 --> 75.30]  Oh, you guys are so bashful.
[75.30 --> 78.96]  You guys have literally had a piece of glass in your face all week.
[79.90 --> 81.02]  Are we doing it all at a time?
[81.26 --> 82.58]  Wait, should we leave now?
[82.68 --> 83.42]  Oh, wow.
[83.72 --> 84.66]  Look at that.
[85.12 --> 85.98]  It's Rod.
[86.34 --> 87.08]  Here, take my spot.
[87.18 --> 88.04]  I can't have his shirt on.
[88.80 --> 90.26]  Yeah, it's okay.
[90.42 --> 91.46]  You might want to scoot over.
[91.48 --> 91.64]  Oh, really?
[92.04 --> 93.20]  Yeah, yeah. It's okay. It's okay.
[93.76 --> 95.18]  It's Rod and Bob.
[95.78 --> 96.46]  What's up, guys?
[96.46 --> 102.40]  Did Linus and Luke just film another week-long show with these guys?
[102.54 --> 104.40]  Why do we keep inviting you here?
[105.30 --> 114.10]  So our celebrity judges were Justine, Stephen, and Riley, and our co-competitors were Rod and Bob.
[114.22 --> 120.48]  Stay tuned because Tech Showdown, it'll be... I forget what I'm allowed to call them now.
[121.02 --> 121.62]  Whatever.
[121.96 --> 127.58]  The Tech Showdown videos that are going to be coming soon are going to be totally unlike previous Tech Showdowns.
[127.58 --> 129.62]  It's going to be pretty flippin' sick.
[129.62 --> 136.38]  So, right now it's showing viewers zero, which usually I have the Twitch chat up.
[136.74 --> 138.66]  It's possible we are streaming to no one.
[138.88 --> 142.30]  It's also entirely possible that it's not reporting correctly.
[142.70 --> 144.42]  How many times have you guys done this?
[144.42 --> 145.72]  I'm going to find out what's going on.
[146.42 --> 146.82]  You know what?
[146.82 --> 147.28]  It happens?
[147.28 --> 151.52]  I pretty much walked off of the set onto here.
[152.00 --> 152.76]  Not pretty much.
[153.02 --> 153.38]  Literally.
[153.56 --> 154.94]  That is exactly what happened.
[155.26 --> 156.02]  It is very true.
[156.54 --> 160.08]  And I didn't have a lot of time to kind of set everything up correctly.
[160.30 --> 161.74]  So you'll have to bear with me here.
[161.76 --> 162.96]  I got a notification that it's live.
[163.10 --> 163.66]  Oh, that's good.
[164.30 --> 164.46]  Yeah.
[164.46 --> 165.30]  This looks...
[165.30 --> 166.00]  Yeah, we're live.
[166.10 --> 166.78]  There are people watching.
[166.84 --> 167.18]  It's all good.
[167.24 --> 168.18]  Okay, so thanks, guys.
[168.74 --> 170.12]  So stay tuned for that.
[170.24 --> 172.00]  And why don't we jump into our...
[172.00 --> 173.50]  Oh, intro for the week.
[174.16 --> 174.40]  Boop.
[174.80 --> 176.40]  Well, usually we tease some topics.
[176.58 --> 176.86]  Oh, yeah.
[176.96 --> 177.80]  Normally we tease some topics.
[177.84 --> 178.00]  Whatever.
[178.12 --> 179.26]  We've got crazy guests.
[179.38 --> 180.06]  We don't need topics.
[180.44 --> 180.52]  Fair.
[180.52 --> 182.14]  You could sit here and talk about anything.
[184.78 --> 186.14]  Prepare some of the best shows.
[186.38 --> 187.36]  Have no news.
[187.84 --> 188.46]  That's true.
[191.66 --> 193.02]  Right now, you know.
[196.34 --> 197.16]  All right.
[197.16 --> 198.84]  Functionality is a big issue.
[198.96 --> 200.66]  Sponsors for the show today.
[202.46 --> 204.30]  And let's get started.
[204.54 --> 208.42]  So the original article here is from Tom's Guide.
[208.52 --> 209.92]  I'm going to go ahead and throw that up.
[210.06 --> 213.42]  But the word on the street is...
[213.42 --> 216.46]  When this click, you know, works at some point.
[216.64 --> 218.58]  It's a word that I'm pretty excited about.
[218.58 --> 227.14]  The iPhone 8 is the world's fastest phone to go along with my world's slowest Wi-Fi right now.
[227.16 --> 227.24]  Wow.
[227.96 --> 230.06]  Apparently not even close.
[230.16 --> 230.92]  Did you see...
[230.92 --> 231.68]  Six core processor.
[231.76 --> 232.36]  Did you see this coming?
[232.92 --> 233.32]  No.
[233.48 --> 236.70]  But I did see a bunch of reviews of people doing speed tests.
[236.96 --> 237.12]  Yeah.
[237.12 --> 242.94]  Even comparing the 8 to the Note 8, which was incredible because the Note 8 definitely did lag behind.
[243.34 --> 243.60]  Yep.
[243.60 --> 244.16]  Yeah.
[244.16 --> 244.24]  Yeah.
[244.24 --> 254.22]  Like specifically, if we look at 3D Mark, the iPhone 8, 62,000, 8 plus, 64,000 Note 8, you just referenced, 39,000.
[254.66 --> 254.90]  Yep.
[255.02 --> 256.02]  I mean, it's one of those things.
[256.20 --> 258.60]  I got a lot of flack from my Note 8 review.
[258.80 --> 259.74]  People didn't really like it.
[259.78 --> 261.16]  They said I didn't really give it enough credit.
[261.16 --> 265.66]  But one of my key points was not that it was a bad phone at all.
[265.80 --> 266.78]  I said it's a great phone.
[266.88 --> 270.60]  It's probably the productivity king if you have any use for the stylus whatsoever.
[270.76 --> 271.76]  Oh, I have it right here, actually.
[271.96 --> 272.64]  There you go.
[272.82 --> 277.56]  And being a huge iPhone fan, too, I was quite surprised how much I really liked this phone.
[277.56 --> 278.86]  Have you watched movies on it?
[279.14 --> 279.98]  I watched Netflix.
[280.38 --> 280.66]  Okay.
[280.78 --> 283.54]  So any 21 by 9, like, ultra-wide screen content.
[283.74 --> 287.70]  It felt a little bit, it wasn't ultra-wide, but it was still, it felt a little bit strange
[287.70 --> 290.04]  because it is a little bit, I don't know.
[290.58 --> 291.02]  It's narrow.
[291.04 --> 291.40]  It's rounded.
[291.64 --> 291.88]  Yeah.
[292.20 --> 296.38]  I mean, I'm not going to complain because, I mean, I watch stuff on planes all the time.
[296.50 --> 297.96]  So that's where I consume most of my content.
[298.10 --> 300.12]  So I'm like, this is a step up from the back of an airplane.
[300.88 --> 305.16]  But yeah, I mean, and I think cameras, too, are something that is what people are mostly into.
[305.34 --> 309.76]  Most normal person who is going to go get their phone, they just want us to take incredible photos to share out.
[309.98 --> 312.58]  And, you know, even getting a chance to see it at the Apple event.
[312.96 --> 314.64]  I mean, and the gold.
[314.86 --> 315.76]  I'm getting so excited.
[316.54 --> 318.40]  This is like what I live for, you guys.
[319.50 --> 326.64]  But in comparison to the X, that's what I'm going to be interested to see because the hype around the 8 is way less than previous years.
[326.96 --> 330.48]  And there were tons of people that were talking about there were no lines, like usual.
[330.78 --> 332.34]  But I feel like that'll be way different for the X.
[332.36 --> 336.74]  Oh, the X is going to be a completely different story because, and don't take this the wrong way,
[336.74 --> 341.42]  it doesn't have to be a derogatory term, but that's the one the zombies are lining up for.
[341.66 --> 342.66]  Yeah, I will be there.
[342.66 --> 347.86]  Like if I was with my undead bells on.
[350.36 --> 354.60]  And it's just, it's one of those things where, anyway, so back to the Note 8.
[354.60 --> 362.40]  One of my criticisms, one of my key criticisms was that every previous Note had something really different, really killer about it.
[362.48 --> 367.24]  And I feel like Apple killed that with the iPhone X.
[367.40 --> 368.76]  But they didn't do that with the 8s.
[368.78 --> 369.64]  With the face, right?
[369.68 --> 371.78]  No, the 8 is the most boring phone of all time.
[371.88 --> 373.54]  I mean, it's essentially a 7S.
[373.60 --> 377.20]  Can you believe they're still using the same shell as the 6?
[377.84 --> 379.32]  No, which is kind of crazy.
[379.44 --> 383.64]  I mean, they tried to get away with it by saying it's the glass back, which it does look really good.
[383.72 --> 384.58]  Like, I like that look.
[384.66 --> 388.12]  That's going back to, like, the iPhone 4 when they first introduced that, which was beautiful.
[388.12 --> 389.24]  I love it before.
[389.38 --> 391.94]  I still have an iPhone 4, actually, on my nightstand.
[392.08 --> 392.90]  It's a great look.
[393.16 --> 394.34]  You iPod it, right, basically?
[394.76 --> 395.06]  Yeah.
[395.24 --> 399.90]  Yeah, I just use it when I need, like, if I'm going to somewhere where, like, I might get mugged or whatever.
[401.10 --> 403.72]  But I want a phone, I just take my iPhone 4.
[404.02 --> 405.20]  People are like, give me your phone.
[405.26 --> 406.18]  I'm going to be like, sure, man.
[406.18 --> 410.74]  Well, clearly you don't have much love for it if you're going to give it up in the street.
[411.04 --> 411.96]  Well, come on.
[412.12 --> 413.50]  It's worth less than my life.
[413.54 --> 414.34]  I'll say that much.
[414.96 --> 422.78]  To add some more stats to this before we keep on going, in Geekbench 4, the iPhone 8 was 54% faster than the Galaxy Note 8.
[424.56 --> 424.88]  54%?
[425.22 --> 425.66]  54%.
[425.66 --> 429.42]  And just in standard media encoding, I don't remember exactly what was it.
[429.42 --> 432.08]  It was a 2-minute 4K video encoded.
[432.48 --> 434.62]  The iPhone 8 finished in 42 seconds.
[434.62 --> 437.14]  The Note 8 took more than 3 minutes.
[437.34 --> 440.34]  And the Galaxy S8 Plus took more than 4 minutes.
[440.34 --> 441.96]  So what that tells us is two things.
[442.06 --> 444.30]  Number one is that the iPhone 8 is hella fast.
[444.30 --> 455.02]  And number two is that they are actually walking the walk when it comes to GPU computing and CPU computing and marrying them together.
[455.28 --> 455.36]  Yeah.
[455.36 --> 461.94]  Because AMD has been talking about that since the acquisition of ATI back in, what was it?
[462.18 --> 462.98]  Stephen would know this.
[463.02 --> 463.22]  What was it?
[463.24 --> 463.70]  2008?
[464.02 --> 464.28]  What?
[464.58 --> 465.56]  ATI acquisition?
[466.10 --> 466.68]  Yeah, that's right, right.
[466.68 --> 466.96]  Yeah.
[466.96 --> 469.30]  So whatever, about 10 years ago.
[469.72 --> 475.80]  Since then, AMD has been talking about how the GPU is going to be this fundamental fusion, they called it.
[476.12 --> 481.00]  You were not going to be able to tell the difference between a CPU doing something and a GPU doing something.
[481.00 --> 490.42]  You were just going to click go on a web page or you were going to click encode on a video or warp stabilize in a video editing application.
[490.42 --> 494.96]  And it was just going to use whichever one it used or some mixture of the two.
[495.04 --> 500.92]  And we were going to treat the GPU like more CPU cores and programmers were going to get into it.
[500.98 --> 502.20]  And it never happened.
[502.58 --> 515.14]  But this is one of those infuriating things for the non-Apple folks out there where Apple takes an idea that everybody else has been talking about for all this freaking time and then actually does it.
[515.48 --> 516.76]  That's classic Apple fashion.
[516.76 --> 525.82]  I mean, you know, being a huge Apple fan, I think I get so much crap from the rest of you guys, which, you know, I, I, and for fair, for fair reasons, which I'm not saying.
[526.18 --> 534.54]  But, you know, I mean, what Apple is good at is taking all the things that everyone has been doing really, really well, and then they make it a widespread thing for everyone to enjoy and easy to use.
[534.64 --> 536.48]  Like during the Apple event, there was a few things.
[536.54 --> 540.18]  I know wireless charging was one of them for me where I was like, thank God they're doing it.
[540.28 --> 540.48]  Finally.
[540.48 --> 541.72]  Because now everyone will do it.
[541.72 --> 542.00]  Exactly.
[542.24 --> 542.56]  Finally.
[542.56 --> 548.56]  And I am, I was so afraid that just completely unnecessarily.
[548.72 --> 549.92]  They were going to make it some other technology.
[549.92 --> 550.98]  They were going to make it proprietary.
[551.32 --> 551.40]  Me too.
[551.48 --> 552.10]  I was like, no.
[552.28 --> 554.60]  I was, I was sure of it.
[554.78 --> 555.44]  I was too.
[555.46 --> 556.04]  But you know what?
[556.08 --> 563.60]  I think we actually do have like lackluster, but present adoption of the technology broadly enough.
[563.74 --> 571.60]  I think we have that to thank for Apple kind of going, okay, this has enough momentum now that we don't need to absolutely break all the things for no apparent reason.
[571.60 --> 572.24]  Yeah.
[572.34 --> 575.52]  And I mean, I thought they might have switched to USB-C for the X, but they didn't.
[575.78 --> 577.14]  I was hoping that they would.
[577.24 --> 579.04]  I was kind of hoping that they would as well.
[579.76 --> 587.26]  And I was really hoping like a lot of devices have a type C port, but if you go and transfer photos off of them, they're actually running at USB 2 speeds.
[587.58 --> 594.24]  And I know that Apple actually did have a USB 3 lightning connector on the iPad Pro as of, I believe, the first gen.
[594.78 --> 598.94]  So I'll be interested to see if the lightning connector on the X is at least USB 3.
[599.18 --> 600.04]  That would be sick.
[600.04 --> 601.18]  Now, quick question.
[601.28 --> 602.90]  I just noticed you called it the X.
[603.56 --> 604.24]  It's a mistake.
[604.32 --> 604.68]  Sorry.
[604.78 --> 605.22]  It's 10.
[605.34 --> 605.72]  I know.
[606.02 --> 608.72]  And I do that because I use Final Cut X, which is also Final Cut 10.
[608.88 --> 609.06]  Right.
[609.12 --> 610.56]  And I've been calling it that since the beginning.
[610.68 --> 610.84]  Yeah.
[610.96 --> 612.02]  So I'm so sorry.
[612.12 --> 615.80]  But then Apple's thing is like OS X is not OS X.
[615.86 --> 616.52]  It's OS X.
[616.52 --> 624.98]  So they have a long enough history of X is 10 that we're just supposed to ignore that all the other phones are called 7 and not VII.
[625.30 --> 627.34]  Well, where did the iPhone 9 go?
[627.78 --> 628.16]  Yeah.
[628.66 --> 629.64]  I have a theory.
[629.64 --> 633.56]  I think the iPhone 9 is coming next September.
[633.96 --> 636.70]  That's actually a brilliant idea that I didn't even think about.
[636.70 --> 639.90]  So the iPhone 9 is coming and it's going to still be the like step down.
[640.04 --> 641.40]  It's going to be like the new SE.
[642.12 --> 642.34]  Okay.
[642.34 --> 649.90]  And then the X2 or the 11 or whatever, whatever they end up going with in terms of this series naming or the X Mark II.
[650.00 --> 650.28]  You know what?
[650.38 --> 652.20]  I hear again, tinfoil hat.
[652.40 --> 654.58]  I think they're just going to call it the iPhone X again next year.
[655.10 --> 658.38]  I think they're just going to call it the same thing because they've done it with every other bloody product line.
[658.38 --> 661.28]  If they actually add like Mark II, that's kind of cool.
[661.42 --> 662.30]  But they don't.
[662.48 --> 662.94]  Yeah, I know.
[663.18 --> 663.98]  That's the issue.
[664.08 --> 665.46]  You said Mark II and I was like, that's pretty sweet.
[665.46 --> 666.30]  Late 2018.
[667.00 --> 669.40]  No, the naming dimensions are a little bit off.
[669.40 --> 672.26]  I mean, technically the 8 should be a 7S.
[672.66 --> 679.60]  But I mean, if I'm not mistaken, I believe it's the same A11 chip that is also in the 8 and the X.
[679.70 --> 680.16]  Is that correct?
[680.20 --> 680.76]  I believe so, yeah.
[681.32 --> 682.80]  So I don't know.
[682.86 --> 684.74]  I mean, they're still sharing a lot of that same technology.
[684.84 --> 686.64]  And I think it's going to be like, do you want facial recognition?
[686.80 --> 689.26]  And do you want to give up that touch ID button?
[689.38 --> 690.68]  I don't want to give up touch ID.
[690.76 --> 691.62]  I love touch ID.
[691.64 --> 692.94]  And I don't think my parents would either.
[693.10 --> 696.02]  So I feel like there's a different kind of generation gap.
[696.30 --> 697.26]  And I don't know.
[697.26 --> 701.06]  It's going to be interesting to see when the X comes out what people kind of gravitate towards.
[701.24 --> 705.76]  I think that's part of the reason we didn't get a new shell for the 8 is that now it's the value phone.
[706.16 --> 706.30]  Yeah.
[706.54 --> 706.78]  Yeah.
[706.94 --> 707.14]  Yeah.
[707.66 --> 715.32]  In much the same way that like you, you know, if you buy an SE, it's that iPhone 5 shell.
[716.08 --> 716.36]  Yeah.
[716.50 --> 720.98]  So the value phone is like, like it's one of those things where Apple.
[721.20 --> 721.66]  It's status.
[721.78 --> 722.38]  It's appearance.
[722.38 --> 727.00]  It's a status symbol where if you get the jet black one, everyone knows you're a mega baller and bought the top of the line.
[727.88 --> 729.16]  And then you put a case on it.
[729.20 --> 729.52]  I know.
[730.12 --> 731.20]  This is terrible.
[732.24 --> 733.56]  But in much the same way.
[733.76 --> 734.94]  You don't even know.
[735.12 --> 737.42]  There's no way you can even tell unless you look.
[737.54 --> 745.70]  I think Apple wants people who buy an 8 to feel like last gen chumps a little bit for at a glance for it to not look any different.
[746.00 --> 746.30]  For sure.
[746.76 --> 746.88]  Yeah.
[747.04 --> 748.92]  I mean, because they even rotated the camera, right?
[749.34 --> 750.36]  No, that's on the X.
[750.50 --> 751.72]  The X has the rotated camera.
[751.82 --> 751.96]  Yeah.
[751.96 --> 752.48]  That's what I'm saying.
[752.66 --> 752.76]  Yeah.
[752.76 --> 754.96]  So it's like extremely recognizably different.
[755.06 --> 755.30]  Yes.
[755.54 --> 756.48]  It's really different.
[756.48 --> 757.76]  Because I don't think that was for a reason.
[758.78 --> 759.22]  Could have been.
[759.84 --> 760.08]  Yeah.
[760.10 --> 761.44]  I'm not actually sure.
[761.68 --> 762.62]  That'd be interesting to see.
[762.76 --> 764.82]  I'd like to see like an iFixit tear down or something.
[764.82 --> 775.66]  So it's killer fast, which really surprised me because Apple stubbornly stuck to two core designs for the longest time when the entire rest of the industry was going like,
[776.38 --> 779.20]  No, put all the cores into the phones.
[779.20 --> 785.46]  Even though historically it hasn't made a huge difference to performance in the applications that most people are using.
[785.90 --> 796.58]  But if I had to guess, I would say this utilization of both CPU and GPU and this addition of multiple cores is really Apple's way of saying,
[796.70 --> 802.94]  Okay, look, we think that people are going to need all these cores for the kinds of workloads that are coming to phones in the near future.
[803.08 --> 806.16]  And if it's Apple, they're pretty good at predicting that.
[806.16 --> 809.66]  Now, I had people approach me out of the blue and say,
[809.82 --> 814.34]  Can you believe so much of the keynote was about this stupid facial emoji thing?
[814.50 --> 816.40]  Oh, and they spent a lot of time on the watch.
[817.16 --> 818.18]  Okay, that was dumb.
[818.90 --> 820.10]  Because who cares about the watch?
[820.14 --> 820.54]  No offense.
[820.86 --> 827.64]  Okay, but to be fair, listen, you don't even need to have your phone.
[827.94 --> 829.52]  You can have LTE on your wrist.
[829.62 --> 832.24]  Granted, the battery life is not very good.
[832.30 --> 834.44]  I think you might have talk time of like an hour.
[834.44 --> 839.36]  But the fact that you don't need your phone, you can literally do, okay, don't, I don't want to, don't, don't you, don't you take your head.
[839.74 --> 840.72]  Don't, I'll stand up.
[841.90 --> 843.10]  You're going to be out of frame.
[843.54 --> 844.48]  I don't care.
[844.94 --> 850.72]  I mean, I don't think it's for everybody, but I think that that is somewhat revolutionary in the fact that you really don't need this.
[850.78 --> 851.42]  I don't need anything.
[851.56 --> 852.42]  I can go for a walk.
[852.58 --> 853.22]  I don't, and especially.
[853.22 --> 854.88]  You can go for a walk, but don't go far.
[854.90 --> 855.46]  Don't go far.
[855.94 --> 856.14]  Yeah, yeah.
[856.20 --> 856.34]  Yeah.
[856.52 --> 859.14]  Sorry, Brandon, it's because Justine's a little bit further back here.
[859.26 --> 861.88]  If you, if you, if you scooch up, then we're good.
[862.14 --> 862.48]  There we go.
[862.48 --> 865.56]  But Anna was getting rowdy and like, don't you start dissing the watch.
[866.28 --> 870.26]  Look, the watch, the watch, it has the potential.
[870.38 --> 871.94]  Okay, I have a Mark Zero or whatever.
[872.06 --> 873.06]  I have the original one.
[873.50 --> 875.98]  And my issue with it is that it's a development kit.
[876.18 --> 877.98]  It is not a finished product.
[878.20 --> 886.22]  It is a showcase of what they want the Apple Watch to do with a piss poor battery and no ability to have the actual time showing all the time.
[887.50 --> 888.96]  Well, at least I know what time it is.
[889.00 --> 890.26]  It sometimes takes a little while.
[890.26 --> 890.50]  Yeah.
[890.74 --> 894.02]  But, and I do think that, of course, this is going to be the first gen of Melty.
[895.18 --> 896.00]  Come on!
[896.00 --> 904.08]  So, I mean, the joke in my review is that it works great if you're sitting there and if you don't mind whoever you're with to know that you're like, yo, what time it is.
[904.30 --> 905.48]  But like, okay, imagine this.
[905.58 --> 909.46]  Like, so in my review, I bring up, like, what if you're in the middle of an awkward sexual encounter?
[909.60 --> 910.32]  You're on your back.
[910.78 --> 912.10]  You know, you want to know what time it is.
[912.36 --> 913.32]  It literally doesn't work.
[913.42 --> 913.80]  Well, I mean, it's just...
[913.80 --> 914.58]  You can't find out.
[914.70 --> 915.34]  Who you're talking to.
[915.34 --> 916.78]  You can't find out when it's going to be over.
[917.22 --> 919.08]  I mean, like, I love my Apple Watch.
[919.46 --> 921.56]  So, that's totally fine for me.
[922.54 --> 923.48]  I'm just uncomfortable.
[923.68 --> 924.36]  It's part of the experience.
[925.48 --> 925.84]  Understandably.
[925.96 --> 926.48]  Understandably.
[926.48 --> 928.24]  But does it have the red dot on it?
[928.28 --> 930.28]  Because if not, it's not LTE and I need to leave.
[930.58 --> 931.16]  Oh, man.
[931.38 --> 931.54]  So.
[931.72 --> 932.18]  There you go.
[932.68 --> 933.68]  And is it ceramic?
[933.88 --> 934.50]  I need to know.
[935.20 --> 935.52]  No.
[935.76 --> 941.10]  I think it makes a little bit more sense maybe in the States because you guys can get companion sims fairly easily.
[941.24 --> 941.66]  I don't think up here.
[941.66 --> 942.22]  I think it's coming up here.
[942.72 --> 943.92]  It's not yet, really.
[943.96 --> 944.20]  Okay.
[944.54 --> 946.58]  And I think in Europe it's less common, too.
[946.58 --> 949.48]  So, if I came here, I actually wouldn't be able to use it.
[949.86 --> 949.88]  So.
[950.26 --> 951.18]  Let's talk about the bump.
[951.56 --> 951.78]  Okay.
[951.88 --> 953.84]  So, last Apple topic for now.
[953.92 --> 955.46]  But let's talk about the bump on the watch, then.
[955.46 --> 961.10]  They made a big song and dance about how they used the same frame with all the new tech packed into it.
[961.32 --> 965.30]  Two pieces of paper thicker at the crystal.
[965.54 --> 965.84]  Okay.
[966.62 --> 967.78]  Where's the end point of that?
[968.00 --> 971.40]  Are they just going to keep doing this and just keep making the bump bigger?
[971.94 --> 976.40]  But, honestly, I looked at it and then I put it on and I could not tell the difference.
[976.40 --> 978.02]  I mean, two pieces of paper.
[978.28 --> 978.42]  What?
[978.96 --> 980.88]  It seems like it would be very hard to notice.
[980.94 --> 984.14]  You would not be able to notice because you already can feel this when it's on your wrist.
[984.14 --> 986.74]  But the two pieces of paper, you're fine.
[987.06 --> 987.24]  Yeah.
[987.90 --> 990.84]  But if you want to find some more reasons to hate it, that's fine.
[991.14 --> 991.74]  Oh, that's...
[991.74 --> 992.82]  No, we don't have time for that.
[993.42 --> 995.74]  That's pretty easy for me to do.
[996.82 --> 997.74]  Hold on a second.
[1000.98 --> 1003.82]  Let me just see if there's anything else interesting in here.
[1003.82 --> 1005.34]  Yeah.
[1006.74 --> 1007.06]  Oh.
[1007.16 --> 1008.58]  No, I don't like that one.
[1008.58 --> 1008.88]  Okay.
[1009.02 --> 1010.70]  This is off MacRumors.com.
[1010.76 --> 1011.70]  I have some bad news.
[1011.80 --> 1012.56]  Did you know this yet?
[1013.04 --> 1016.16]  I mean, we've kind of all been assuming it since they announced it.
[1016.36 --> 1017.44]  Dun, dun, dun.
[1018.02 --> 1020.96]  iPhone X production faces further delays.
[1021.10 --> 1023.22]  We'll start in mid-October.
[1024.02 --> 1024.42]  Okay.
[1024.80 --> 1026.02]  I've got two questions for you.
[1026.72 --> 1027.86]  Do you think...
[1027.86 --> 1031.20]  Apparently, final production of the iPhone X has yet to even start.
[1032.16 --> 1032.48]  Okay.
[1032.78 --> 1036.60]  I mean, pre-orders are starting the 3rd or 27th.
[1036.64 --> 1036.82]  Wait.
[1037.24 --> 1040.30]  Pre-orders are the 3rd, and it's supposed to ship the 27th.
[1041.30 --> 1044.80]  So if you had to guess, what do you think it is?
[1046.30 --> 1047.00]  What do I think it is?
[1047.00 --> 1047.96]  What's the supply chain issue?
[1048.14 --> 1048.26]  Yeah.
[1049.30 --> 1049.74]  Hmm.
[1050.40 --> 1051.00]  Do you think...
[1051.00 --> 1051.18]  Okay.
[1051.32 --> 1053.84]  Do you think it's that they can't get enough?
[1053.84 --> 1056.08]  Or do you think it's that they need too much?
[1056.22 --> 1058.48]  I guess it's sort of two different ways of looking at it.
[1058.82 --> 1059.64]  So they could...
[1059.64 --> 1061.68]  I mean, realistically, they obviously made one.
[1062.06 --> 1062.96]  They had it on the stage.
[1063.04 --> 1065.98]  Like, they may have been waiting, though, to see how the 8 did.
[1066.48 --> 1067.00]  You think so?
[1067.44 --> 1067.76]  Potentially.
[1068.24 --> 1069.22]  I mean, because they...
[1069.22 --> 1069.70]  I mean, it's the screen.
[1070.44 --> 1071.02]  You think it's the screen?
[1071.02 --> 1072.22]  Aren't they getting the screen from Samsung?
[1072.38 --> 1072.56]  Yeah.
[1073.02 --> 1074.74]  So they could also be limiting the supply.
[1075.60 --> 1076.02]  I need to...
[1076.02 --> 1076.48]  I don't...
[1076.48 --> 1077.36]  There's not a ton of room.
[1077.38 --> 1077.88]  Yeah, I know.
[1077.88 --> 1079.82]  Well, no, don't scoot over more, because you're going to go into the room.
[1079.82 --> 1080.54]  Yeah, then you'll be in the...
[1080.54 --> 1081.70]  I'll stay on the edge.
[1081.70 --> 1083.98]  Look, we aren't set up for guests very well.
[1084.52 --> 1084.90]  We're like...
[1084.90 --> 1086.80]  This mic is in, like, a terrible position.
[1087.16 --> 1090.84]  There's a way better way to do this setup, and I have not been approved yet to fix it.
[1091.10 --> 1091.54]  You haven't?
[1091.72 --> 1091.96]  No.
[1092.18 --> 1093.84]  I asked you to, and you were like, that's way too expensive.
[1093.98 --> 1094.88]  It's way too expensive.
[1095.46 --> 1097.06]  It's like 400 or 500 bucks.
[1097.10 --> 1097.42]  Yeah, I know.
[1097.62 --> 1098.60]  Should we start a GoFundMe?
[1098.82 --> 1099.10]  Yeah.
[1101.14 --> 1103.02]  That's the answer to any stupid thing you need.
[1103.02 --> 1106.34]  You could also just take this mic and, like, probably get Jake to 3D print something to me.
[1106.34 --> 1107.52]  Yeah, that would probably work.
[1107.66 --> 1108.44]  That would probably work.
[1108.44 --> 1115.14]  Yeah, well, there was also some people that were talking about they weren't 100% sure if the facial recognition was ready, so it could also be a software thing.
[1115.22 --> 1118.02]  That might have been a response, yeah, to what happened on stage.
[1118.08 --> 1122.84]  But what happened on stage was that phone had been restarted, and any time you have to restart it, you have to add the pin.
[1123.06 --> 1123.18]  Yeah.
[1123.34 --> 1125.42]  So that was not a facial recognition issue.
[1125.42 --> 1125.74]  Wow.
[1125.74 --> 1127.34]  Someone's pissed about that.
[1127.34 --> 1127.52]  Yeah.
[1127.62 --> 1133.42]  So, I mean, it could be a combination of software not ready and also supply demand for the screens, which is very realistic.
[1133.72 --> 1133.92]  Yeah.
[1133.96 --> 1141.32]  This article also covered that the iPhone 8 is not getting as much interest from customers as previous smartphones launched this fall,
[1141.38 --> 1146.56]  and suggests that there could be many Apple fans holding out for the iPhone X.
[1147.38 --> 1147.62]  Yeah.
[1147.62 --> 1148.06]  Really?
[1148.54 --> 1148.74]  Yeah.
[1148.78 --> 1149.26]  Wow, what a thought.
[1149.26 --> 1152.76]  I mean, of course you just get the 8 and then get the 10 and then, you know.
[1152.98 --> 1153.82]  And just keep them both.
[1153.82 --> 1154.30]  They'd commit you.
[1154.36 --> 1155.14]  They're like, you have a problem.
[1155.30 --> 1155.40]  You don't.
[1155.40 --> 1159.78]  And then you could just rub them on your body every day.
[1159.84 --> 1160.44]  Well, I was surprised.
[1160.44 --> 1162.08]  Try to absorb the Apple-ness.
[1162.16 --> 1164.06]  Because my sister today, she's like, should I go buy a phone?
[1164.06 --> 1165.34]  I was like, oh, you're never going to get one.
[1165.40 --> 1166.98]  She's like, well, walked into Best Buy, got one.
[1167.12 --> 1168.64]  And just, I was like, well, that was easy.
[1169.00 --> 1173.76]  So I'm not sure if the supply, I mean, people are still getting them, same day.
[1173.88 --> 1174.98]  The lines weren't very long.
[1175.12 --> 1177.08]  But the pre-orders was very smooth.
[1177.20 --> 1179.46]  And normally, all of the Apple pre-orders is a disaster.
[1179.62 --> 1181.52]  So maybe things just worked well for the pre-orders.
[1181.52 --> 1190.80]  It is a real departure from standard Apple operating procedure for them to roll out a slide that basically says,
[1191.00 --> 1193.64]  it's everything you love about the iPhone 7, but better.
[1194.40 --> 1194.84]  For?
[1195.14 --> 1195.94]  For the iPhone 8.
[1196.38 --> 1196.58]  Yeah.
[1196.90 --> 1197.30]  Nothing.
[1197.48 --> 1198.32]  They didn't say magical.
[1198.80 --> 1200.02]  They didn't say revolutionary.
[1200.42 --> 1200.96]  They didn't say.
[1201.82 --> 1202.82]  Because it's not, though.
[1203.44 --> 1206.08]  But usually they find a way to make it seem like that.
[1206.08 --> 1206.70]  That's true.
[1206.86 --> 1208.72]  Because they use plastic, so it's unapologetic.
[1208.92 --> 1210.42]  But they were saving that for the X.
[1210.64 --> 1210.96]  10.
[1210.96 --> 1211.30]  10.
[1211.78 --> 1212.42]  I guess so.
[1212.48 --> 1214.80]  But it's just like they still need to sell iPhone 8s.
[1215.60 --> 1217.70]  Yeah, I bet they probably won't have that much of an issue.
[1218.84 --> 1219.80]  Yeah, probably not.
[1220.16 --> 1220.84]  Probably not.
[1220.98 --> 1223.64]  And they'll be able to slow sell them over time, so they'll move them eventually.
[1223.98 --> 1224.22]  Yeah.
[1225.18 --> 1225.72]  All right.
[1225.78 --> 1226.94]  So our next topic.
[1227.40 --> 1227.96]  Thank you.
[1228.08 --> 1228.78]  Yes, thank you.
[1228.78 --> 1228.86]  Bye, guys.
[1228.86 --> 1230.70]  I'll talk to you soon once we're done the show.
[1230.70 --> 1235.36]  Our next topic is definitely right in Stephen's wheelhouse.
[1235.52 --> 1236.46]  So get on in here.
[1238.12 --> 1238.82]  All right.
[1238.82 --> 1241.42]  This is fun.
[1241.62 --> 1242.06]  How's it going?
[1242.78 --> 1243.38]  Pretty good.
[1243.44 --> 1244.34]  Do you want to introduce yourself?
[1245.24 --> 1245.64]  Sure.
[1245.84 --> 1247.58]  I'm Steve from Gamers Nexus.
[1248.38 --> 1249.68]  I think that pretty much wraps it up.
[1249.68 --> 1254.10]  We do technical hardware reviews and analysis.
[1254.72 --> 1255.14]  All right.
[1255.20 --> 1257.14]  Speaking of technical hardware reviews and analysis.
[1257.14 --> 1258.58]  I'm going to add to that for a quick second.
[1258.76 --> 1261.86]  We've referenced Steve and Gamers Nexus quite a few times on WAN Show.
[1261.94 --> 1266.36]  If you've heard us talk about things like the Noctua color controversy and a few other
[1266.36 --> 1267.48]  things, you guys followed up with that.
[1267.48 --> 1268.68]  Yeah, that one was interesting.
[1268.98 --> 1269.20]  Yeah.
[1269.28 --> 1272.10]  So if you guys want to see stuff like that, one thing that I really like on you guys'
[1272.20 --> 1275.60]  channel is how you'll dive into how something was made.
[1276.28 --> 1276.54]  Yeah.
[1276.64 --> 1279.44]  And kind of sometimes rip a company a new one a little bit.
[1279.62 --> 1279.80]  Yeah.
[1279.86 --> 1280.18]  A little bit.
[1280.42 --> 1280.76]  Yeah.
[1282.00 --> 1284.52]  Like it's a fine line to walk.
[1284.70 --> 1284.94]  Yeah.
[1285.16 --> 1285.38]  Yeah.
[1285.48 --> 1285.72]  Yeah.
[1285.72 --> 1287.54]  But I like the attention to detail.
[1287.66 --> 1287.86]  Anyways.
[1287.94 --> 1289.10]  Well liked by consumers.
[1289.10 --> 1295.04]  You get a mixed reaction on the other side of things if you mention Gamers Nexus.
[1295.84 --> 1299.06]  So, rumored Coffee Lake pricing.
[1299.40 --> 1299.70]  Okay.
[1299.78 --> 1300.50]  So, okay.
[1300.76 --> 1306.12]  Now, I don't know how much you know or don't know, and you don't know how much I know or
[1306.12 --> 1307.56]  don't know about Coffee Lake.
[1307.56 --> 1313.02]  So all we can go based on is what we are reading off of this page in front of us, which
[1313.02 --> 1318.92]  is copied off of pchubonline.pl or awesome-table.com.
[1319.22 --> 1319.50]  Okay?
[1319.80 --> 1321.58]  So this is what we're going on.
[1321.74 --> 1323.78]  This is all the information that we have.
[1323.88 --> 1326.24]  But there is some good information in here.
[1326.44 --> 1332.42]  So it tells us how many cores it's rumored to have, what the TDP it's rumored to be,
[1332.56 --> 1333.04]  will be.
[1333.04 --> 1338.74]  But it tells us the rumored TDP, tells us rumored cache, tells us socket rumored, and
[1338.74 --> 1341.36]  it tells us clock speed rumors as well.
[1341.36 --> 1347.46]  So apparently, the Core i7-8700K might end up landing about $400.
[1348.76 --> 1357.40]  As a rumored to be, 6-core, 12-thread processor at 3.7 to 4.7 gigahertz, and whatever, 95-watt
[1357.40 --> 1357.76]  TDP.
[1358.80 --> 1359.92]  Is that too high?
[1360.70 --> 1361.74]  Does that kill it?
[1361.80 --> 1362.52]  Is that USD?
[1362.86 --> 1365.12]  That's a conversion to USD now.
[1365.74 --> 1367.40]  That's, so here's the thing.
[1367.46 --> 1370.10]  We were talking with our Patreon backers a little bit about this.
[1370.10 --> 1371.94]  The problem I have with this...
[1371.94 --> 1373.96]  See that guy just dropped the Patreon plug in there?
[1374.06 --> 1374.38]  That was pro.
[1374.38 --> 1375.42]  That's not what that is.
[1375.76 --> 1376.42]  Thank you.
[1376.74 --> 1378.14]  I've been watching you a while, man.
[1378.24 --> 1379.22]  I know.
[1379.72 --> 1380.12]  I know.
[1380.36 --> 1383.02]  You got that in there right at the beginning, too.
[1383.62 --> 1385.96]  This guy's seen a YouTube retention graph.
[1387.44 --> 1388.74]  So yeah, talking to them.
[1389.06 --> 1394.20]  And the thing is, it is evolution for Intel to go to 6 and 12, right?
[1394.20 --> 1395.62]  That's definitely a movement.
[1396.06 --> 1400.12]  But if you're moving in that direction and then sticking a similar price on it to what
[1400.12 --> 1409.52]  you had on previous high-end i7s, like the low end of the HEDT CPUs, it's not really that
[1409.52 --> 1410.36]  much of an evolution.
[1410.54 --> 1411.44]  So does this seem...
[1411.44 --> 1411.84]  If that's the price.
[1411.88 --> 1413.28]  Does this smell like...
[1413.28 --> 1415.84]  If that pricing is correct, which I don't know if it is.
[1416.04 --> 1419.14]  But if it is, does this smell a little bit like 6950X?
[1419.88 --> 1420.24]  Yeah.
[1420.24 --> 1421.52]  Well, so...
[1421.52 --> 1422.80]  Here's the two more cores.
[1423.06 --> 1427.52]  Oh, by the way, it costs $700 more than the 8-core we had last gen.
[1427.66 --> 1428.84]  Oh, by the way, there's an 8-core.
[1429.60 --> 1431.38]  And enjoy.
[1432.00 --> 1438.84]  One thing I can say about price, because I've said this before, we had an undisclosed manufacturer
[1438.84 --> 1445.70]  talk to us not long ago about pricing targets, and I was told 10 to 20 more than the existing
[1445.70 --> 1446.26]  i7.
[1446.44 --> 1448.72]  See, there it's disruptive.
[1449.40 --> 1449.52]  Right.
[1449.52 --> 1452.82]  Where it's potentially a Ryzen clobberer.
[1453.12 --> 1453.46]  Right, right.
[1453.46 --> 1456.46]  I mean, you got this word right on your shirt here, gamers.
[1456.88 --> 1457.14]  Right.
[1457.30 --> 1463.92]  Would gamers have a reason to buy a Ryzen processor if the 8700K is 10, 20 bucks more than a 7700K?
[1463.92 --> 1466.70]  There's, you know, there's a whole lot of caveats in that question.
[1467.22 --> 1468.22]  How does it overclock?
[1468.34 --> 1469.08]  If you're...
[1469.08 --> 1470.26]  How is the platform stable?
[1470.42 --> 1474.72]  But let's assume it's a reasonably well-thought-out Intel launch.
[1474.72 --> 1478.46]  Let's assume Turbo Boost up to 4.7 works as expected.
[1478.94 --> 1481.66]  Let's assume that everything goes well.
[1482.54 --> 1484.08]  Should you even buy a Ryzen?
[1484.08 --> 1488.92]  If you only play games and you're looking at spending about the same amount of money, then
[1488.92 --> 1489.64]  probably not.
[1490.02 --> 1498.58]  If it's $100 more than an R7 1700 and you do things like actual content creation that is
[1498.58 --> 1503.66]  CPU accelerated, not just GPU accelerated, then you should definitely be looking at Ryzen.
[1503.66 --> 1508.10]  So I think it comes down to a lot of things.
[1508.36 --> 1513.38]  You know, there are a lot of people with Ryzen launch where people who are content creators
[1513.38 --> 1516.92]  are realizing there's so much performance I've left on the table.
[1517.24 --> 1517.50]  Yep.
[1517.78 --> 1519.36]  And they can really accelerate it now.
[1519.48 --> 1524.94]  And people who aren't content creators but want to see AMD succeed are saying, I can multitask.
[1524.94 --> 1530.46]  But there's a difference between having Twitch and your music open and playing a game.
[1530.68 --> 1530.78]  Yeah.
[1531.22 --> 1534.90]  And actual, like, what you do or what we do production.
[1535.42 --> 1535.62]  Yeah.
[1535.78 --> 1537.26]  So it depends.
[1537.64 --> 1541.32]  Like, at $408, I think that's a little too much.
[1541.62 --> 1546.22]  Now, the chart also has some expected pricing for other processors.
[1546.72 --> 1549.96]  And it has the 8600K.
[1549.96 --> 1554.36]  So that's the rumored six core six thread at $286.
[1554.54 --> 1560.12]  So we could be seeing this particular listing inflated on the i7 because that's the most popular
[1560.12 --> 1563.20]  we know from our Amazon sales affiliate link stuff.
[1563.54 --> 1567.46]  We know it's by far Intel's most popular channel processor anyway.
[1568.34 --> 1573.56]  But if we're looking at, let's say the price gap is more like $100, which is what it normally is.
[1573.56 --> 1577.74]  So let's say that one is more like, you know, $380 something.
[1577.74 --> 1581.30]  At $286, again, the gamer question.
[1581.52 --> 1586.12]  And the rumor is that the 8400 will also be a six core part.
[1587.32 --> 1597.12]  I mean, that, according to previous asterisk 400 parts, should be like a $235, $245 part.
[1598.18 --> 1598.62]  Yeah.
[1598.74 --> 1603.12]  And again, it's not really, it's not a linear evolution if the price increases.
[1603.58 --> 1603.82]  Yeah.
[1603.88 --> 1605.08]  It moves the bar.
[1605.08 --> 1613.86]  So currently, i5s, and we said this in our review of the R5s, there's not a lot of reason to buy an i5 right now.
[1613.96 --> 1616.06]  The i7 still holds on really well.
[1616.24 --> 1616.40]  Yeah.
[1616.70 --> 1619.68]  But you look at r5s and there's actual gains there.
[1619.78 --> 1625.78]  There's gains in frame times and specific games where you don't really get that change with an i7 because it's already got all the threads.
[1625.86 --> 1626.02]  Yeah.
[1626.02 --> 1638.52]  So, yeah, I mean, I would need to see i5s stay the same price if they're increasing core count or come down with the current core count to be viable to me still.
[1638.52 --> 1646.96]  I think part of the issue here, and it's not going to make up like $150, but part of the issue here is that we're going for another currency and converting back to USD.
[1647.26 --> 1650.52]  And it's not just dollar conversion that happens there.
[1650.52 --> 1652.42]  There's different pricings in different regions.
[1652.42 --> 1652.80]  There's tariffs.
[1652.80 --> 1653.72]  There's import taxes.
[1653.94 --> 1654.48]  There's all this kind of stuff.
[1654.48 --> 1668.18]  There's the fact that this is an early listing, so they could be trying to convince stupid customers to pre-order based on this pricing that will actually drop on launch day once availability is real and pricing is real and everyone gets their listings up.
[1668.38 --> 1668.52]  Yeah.
[1669.50 --> 1671.72]  Some include like VAT and stuff too.
[1671.72 --> 1672.12]  Yeah.
[1672.12 --> 1672.28]  Yeah.
[1672.38 --> 1674.44]  So, yeah, this could have like 90% included.
[1674.96 --> 1677.34]  So, we'll take it for what it is.
[1677.70 --> 1681.20]  A rumor based on incomplete data at best.
[1681.20 --> 1688.56]  And I would say to add some value to the rumor, like my look at it is if it is $400 to $410 for the i7, that's kind of too much.
[1688.68 --> 1691.78]  It might be a good performer, but that's more than I want to see.
[1692.10 --> 1700.54]  If it's like $10 to $20 more than the current i7s, that falls in line with Intel's current price creep where every generation they've very slowly increased it.
[1700.54 --> 1700.82]  Yeah.
[1700.82 --> 1701.76]  Dollars at a time.
[1702.00 --> 1702.22]  Yeah.
[1702.46 --> 1703.50]  So, that's kind of how it is.
[1703.50 --> 1705.70]  They really do play a long game, don't they?
[1705.70 --> 1706.34]  They do, man.
[1706.66 --> 1706.82]  Yeah.
[1707.62 --> 1710.82]  It's like, sometimes you look at what they're doing and you go...
[1711.36 --> 1713.82]  But then other times you look at what they're doing and you go...
[1714.38 --> 1714.68]  Yeah.
[1716.20 --> 1720.16]  Speaking of rumors with not a ton of credibility, this one's from WCCF Tech.
[1720.82 --> 1721.10]  Oh.
[1721.72 --> 1724.94]  Apparently this came out of Eurocom.
[1724.94 --> 1741.90]  It is rumored, and this is, again, this is very early rumors, that the upcoming 10 nanometer ice lake will bump the core count from 6 to 8, and then the thread count from 12 to 16 to match AMD's Ryzen 7, and that'll be second half of 2018.
[1741.90 --> 1747.56]  So, the timing sounds right, because Intel does refresh every year, even if they don't really have anything to show us.
[1747.70 --> 1748.26]  At least can you.
[1748.26 --> 1751.90]  You or I could have guessed that, though.
[1752.26 --> 1753.92]  They're going to have a new processor next year.
[1754.04 --> 1756.64]  Yeah, but I actually wouldn't have guessed they'd go 8 core.
[1757.14 --> 1758.50]  I would have said they might not bother.
[1758.96 --> 1762.14]  I was kind of expecting 8 core for Coffee Lake.
[1762.92 --> 1763.02]  Really?
[1763.28 --> 1763.54]  Yeah.
[1764.48 --> 1773.22]  Because, I don't know, it takes a while to make a CPU, so it's not like Coffee Lake is a response to Ryzen specifically as a piece of silicon.
[1773.84 --> 1775.44]  There might be marketing attached to it, that is.
[1775.44 --> 1775.88]  Yeah.
[1776.58 --> 1778.10]  There might be pricing attached, that is.
[1778.10 --> 1778.28]  Right.
[1778.38 --> 1784.54]  Like, we might have seen a 6 core Coffee Lake as, like, a 449 mainstream processor.
[1784.64 --> 1785.78]  And we'll never know.
[1785.90 --> 1787.44]  To blur the lines even further.
[1788.28 --> 1788.66]  Right.
[1789.38 --> 1789.74]  Yes.
[1789.84 --> 1790.20]  I don't know.
[1790.22 --> 1791.44]  I don't really know much about Ice Lake.
[1791.44 --> 1794.58]  I don't know anything officially, and I haven't followed rumors.
[1795.06 --> 1795.16]  Yeah.
[1795.32 --> 1796.96]  Well, I think it's pretty damn early on.
[1796.96 --> 1798.92]  Don't the rumors get overwhelming at a point?
[1799.52 --> 1801.00]  I try to stay away from them.
[1801.18 --> 1801.38]  Right.
[1801.68 --> 1802.78]  And we're so flung out.
[1802.90 --> 1804.44]  Like, that's something I've been saying about Wancho.
[1804.44 --> 1805.00]  Wancho.
[1805.00 --> 1810.28]  We've been covering rumors of the same AMD parts for, like, over half a year.
[1810.40 --> 1812.06]  Like, I think we're like nine months in now, man.
[1812.18 --> 1812.46]  Okay.
[1812.82 --> 1813.48]  Tinfoil hat.
[1813.62 --> 1813.94]  Damn.
[1813.94 --> 1815.78]  AMD rumors.
[1816.26 --> 1821.86]  Are they actually leaks, or are they buzz generation created intentionally?
[1822.48 --> 1825.60]  By AMD or a company associated with them.
[1825.60 --> 1829.46]  By AMD or a company associated with them.
[1829.46 --> 1832.30]  And there's two facets to the answer.
[1832.48 --> 1836.26]  If you think it's people at AMD, do you think it is sanctioned?
[1836.40 --> 1838.36]  Or do you think it is, like...
[1838.36 --> 1839.22]  Guerrilla marketing?
[1839.38 --> 1845.34]  Guerrilla marketing from people at AMD who, like, think they have hot shit and let people
[1845.34 --> 1845.86]  know about it.
[1845.90 --> 1849.14]  They have their own guerrilla marketing from Red Team Plus.
[1849.24 --> 1849.72]  Is that it?
[1849.84 --> 1850.16]  Yeah.
[1850.42 --> 1850.60]  Yeah.
[1850.60 --> 1852.38]  I mean, that kind of fills that role already.
[1852.38 --> 1853.36]  I don't know.
[1853.52 --> 1859.72]  Like, I've only ever had one person approach me and say, here's some leaked information.
[1860.62 --> 1861.90]  Like, that's happened one time.
[1863.54 --> 1865.90]  And it wasn't really anything to work with.
[1866.12 --> 1870.18]  Like, it was clearly a, please post this, we need something.
[1870.56 --> 1870.72]  Yeah.
[1870.78 --> 1873.32]  So it wasn't like, our IHSs are soldered.
[1873.48 --> 1873.68]  Right.
[1873.72 --> 1878.28]  But it wasn't from a big three, like, major engineering company.
[1878.28 --> 1884.28]  So I don't, like, there's so, I don't think they would need to manufacture rumors.
[1884.62 --> 1887.28]  It seems like the community kind of does that well enough on their own.
[1888.20 --> 1889.34]  So, I don't know.
[1889.34 --> 1889.66]  All right.
[1889.80 --> 1890.30]  Fair enough.
[1891.00 --> 1892.80]  So my theory is that it's guerrilla.
[1893.40 --> 1898.56]  Because, I mean, if you've spent any time in Taiwan or around Taiwanese people working
[1898.56 --> 1906.18]  in Taiwanese companies, you'll know that the way the industry is inbred is actually unfathomable
[1906.18 --> 1906.96]  from the outside.
[1906.96 --> 1911.90]  Like, the way people flit around from company to company, sometimes even landing back at
[1911.90 --> 1913.84]  the same one multiple times.
[1914.68 --> 1917.14]  Everybody knows everybody.
[1918.12 --> 1921.82]  And Taiwan is a small place.
[1922.86 --> 1923.34]  Literally.
[1923.94 --> 1924.18]  Yeah.
[1924.56 --> 1925.50]  A small place.
[1925.98 --> 1929.56]  And the thing about it is that even if you look at companies like, well, you could kind
[1929.56 --> 1931.32]  of go, well, AMD's not headquartered in Taiwan.
[1931.72 --> 1932.36]  Neither is Intel.
[1933.14 --> 1933.62]  Sure.
[1933.62 --> 1937.90]  But you got to understand, if you want to build a motherboard for a CPU.
[1937.90 --> 1941.34]  You're working with people in Taiwan and China and probably Hong Kong.
[1941.44 --> 1947.06]  There's people in Taiwan who have spec sheets for Ice Lake based on what Intel is expecting,
[1947.28 --> 1947.78]  like, now.
[1948.48 --> 1948.62]  Definitely.
[1948.62 --> 1949.46]  Like, they're thinking about it.
[1949.98 --> 1950.68]  They're working on it.
[1950.68 --> 1956.14]  People who make retention, the actual, like, socket retention kit probably already know
[1956.14 --> 1956.94]  or will soon.
[1957.14 --> 1957.32]  Yeah.
[1957.68 --> 1957.90]  Yeah.
[1958.52 --> 1959.06]  So, yeah.
[1959.12 --> 1966.06]  I mean, and you would think that loyalty or legal, I don't know, like, action ability
[1966.06 --> 1970.12]  at that level is so far removed that it'd be easier to leak something.
[1970.84 --> 1971.10]  Yeah.
[1971.68 --> 1971.96]  Yeah.
[1971.96 --> 1973.92]  Rather than getting legal to sign off on something.
[1973.98 --> 1974.16]  Right.
[1974.44 --> 1979.90]  I mean, we've had, like, I've had really frank conversations with, okay, I'll say with a
[1979.90 --> 1982.04]  big three company that I criticized recently.
[1982.58 --> 1983.46]  I'll say that.
[1983.56 --> 1984.26]  So, one of them.
[1984.40 --> 1985.56]  So, one of them.
[1985.56 --> 1993.64]  And the conversation went, look, you guys have an opportunity right now to turn this
[1993.64 --> 1996.74]  criticism into a huge PR win.
[1997.24 --> 2002.30]  All you have to do is come on stream with me and talk about it.
[2002.80 --> 2010.26]  Talk about how you did something, maybe not wrong, but not in the consumer's best interest.
[2010.26 --> 2011.60]  But not hide from questions.
[2011.60 --> 2014.98]  And say sorry and commit to do better.
[2015.56 --> 2016.60]  That's what you have to do.
[2016.68 --> 2020.78]  You can take this thing that we can hopefully both agree if we both live on planet Earth
[2020.78 --> 2024.24]  and drink the same water and eat the same food and live in the same reality.
[2024.52 --> 2026.38]  That we can both agree happened.
[2026.50 --> 2026.98]  That's questionable.
[2027.26 --> 2027.42]  Yeah.
[2030.10 --> 2032.98]  And you guys can just take it head on.
[2033.74 --> 2035.66]  And the email thread is actually quite long.
[2036.12 --> 2037.58]  Like, it's a couple dozen replies.
[2037.82 --> 2041.98]  And there was a conference call that did take place where we talked about it.
[2042.08 --> 2043.88]  And then it went dead.
[2043.88 --> 2048.94]  So, it got killed by a C-level or a VP level or legal.
[2049.60 --> 2051.28]  And we're just not going to talk about it, apparently.
[2051.98 --> 2053.92]  That happens a lot with legal, I found.
[2054.34 --> 2062.14]  Like, going to, for example, a recent example, the statement on Vega pricing being exceptionally
[2062.14 --> 2063.42]  ambiguous, right?
[2063.48 --> 2064.80]  There was a reason for that.
[2064.92 --> 2065.98]  And it's a legal reason.
[2066.26 --> 2066.56]  Really?
[2066.56 --> 2069.08]  Well, yeah, but not like we're going to get in trouble.
[2069.20 --> 2070.14]  I guess because they'd be bound to it.
[2070.44 --> 2070.76]  Yeah.
[2070.98 --> 2071.96]  To a certain degree.
[2072.08 --> 2077.36]  A preemptive, typical, like, legal being overly concerned about specific phrasing.
[2077.86 --> 2078.26]  Yeah.
[2078.26 --> 2079.98]  And that kills a lot of conversations.
[2080.34 --> 2080.54]  Yeah.
[2080.76 --> 2081.02]  You know.
[2081.42 --> 2082.10]  It's really frustrating.
[2082.10 --> 2082.82]  Which is unfortunate.
[2083.02 --> 2088.88]  Because, like, if you got people on this, either any kind of corporate representative to
[2088.88 --> 2095.68]  actually answer harder questions, whether or not the answer is actually good, that'd still
[2095.68 --> 2096.48]  be a big thing.
[2096.66 --> 2097.20]  Yeah, definitely.
[2097.22 --> 2097.84]  That's unfortunate.
[2098.90 --> 2099.24]  Okay.
[2099.42 --> 2103.04]  Last topic that I think should be a pretty good one for you.
[2103.60 --> 2105.70]  Actually, do you prefer this one or do you want me to find something else?
[2105.94 --> 2106.60]  What's the other one?
[2107.42 --> 2108.00]  Hold on.
[2108.08 --> 2108.42]  Hold on.
[2108.54 --> 2109.08]  I got this.
[2109.16 --> 2109.82]  I got this.
[2111.02 --> 2111.56]  This one.
[2112.54 --> 2113.54]  That's kind of interesting.
[2113.88 --> 2114.44]  Okay, sure.
[2114.44 --> 2115.18]  Running a website.
[2115.48 --> 2117.88]  So this was posted by Goodbytes on the forum.
[2118.34 --> 2118.96]  Don't worry, I know.
[2122.46 --> 2128.68]  But basically, in a nutshell, thanks to JavaScript, which is not to be confused with Java, the
[2128.68 --> 2134.16]  programming language, the Pirate Bay website has put code in their site that turns visiting
[2134.16 --> 2138.74]  computers into mining machines for cryptocurrency without the user knowing.
[2138.74 --> 2141.98]  So your CPU fan is just going to ramp up.
[2142.52 --> 2145.98]  Visitors of the site are completely unaware of the activity.
[2146.58 --> 2151.24]  Other than if you open up Task Manager, you'll see that your CPU is spiking to really high
[2151.24 --> 2152.98]  load, maybe even reaching 100%.
[2152.98 --> 2156.84]  And you may notice that your system is going to be a little bit less responsive if you're
[2156.84 --> 2159.56]  quite familiar with how it's supposed to be running.
[2160.72 --> 2162.40]  So Pirate Bay.
[2163.10 --> 2165.00]  Not run by super ethical people.
[2165.00 --> 2170.36]  So regardless of what we say about the validity of this, I think they're going to keep doing
[2170.36 --> 2170.62]  it.
[2170.96 --> 2172.54]  But your thoughts.
[2173.16 --> 2179.20]  So as I understand it, after this was discovered, they said it was a 24-hour trial.
[2179.38 --> 2179.56]  Yes.
[2179.90 --> 2180.72]  Here, I got a quote.
[2180.86 --> 2181.24]  You want to quote?
[2181.36 --> 2181.48]  Yeah.
[2181.68 --> 2186.74]  The miner is being tested for a short period, approximately 24 hours, as a new way to generate
[2186.74 --> 2187.26]  revenue.
[2187.52 --> 2188.80]  So they didn't mince any words.
[2189.22 --> 2189.44]  No.
[2189.68 --> 2190.38]  Yeah, they don't care.
[2190.38 --> 2201.40]  From like, I will say that in a sort of malicious way, it's absolutely brilliant to try and make
[2201.40 --> 2203.10]  money without being found out.
[2203.56 --> 2205.84]  But it's so wrong.
[2206.12 --> 2206.44]  It's smart.
[2206.70 --> 2206.84]  Yeah.
[2206.84 --> 2207.68]  It's clever.
[2208.74 --> 2210.92]  It's just like how the word great can be used for evil.
[2211.12 --> 2211.52]  Yeah.
[2212.16 --> 2213.26]  It's a great idea.
[2213.26 --> 2219.74]  The thing with that particular cleverness is that when you are found out, and they were,
[2220.48 --> 2221.70]  it's pretty bad.
[2222.96 --> 2227.88]  You're like really digging into high, it's generating more power consumption.
[2228.38 --> 2228.52]  Yeah.
[2228.60 --> 2230.08]  I don't think they care.
[2230.26 --> 2232.02]  Here's a question for you, though.
[2232.02 --> 2240.66]  If you're still a Pirate Bay user at this point, like, I don't follow the piracy scene
[2240.66 --> 2242.34]  as closely as I once did.
[2242.40 --> 2246.96]  It is no secret that I had a pirated copy of Far Cry.
[2247.50 --> 2249.10]  I definitely did.
[2249.86 --> 2254.00]  Part of the issue was that my disc one didn't work anymore, okay?
[2254.16 --> 2257.62]  But there were definitely other games I didn't have a broken disc one for.
[2257.66 --> 2258.54]  Let's put it that way.
[2259.04 --> 2259.34]  Okay?
[2259.34 --> 2265.56]  But even I know that with all the issues they've gone through with some of the changes
[2265.56 --> 2271.52]  in terms of the personnel running it, Pirate Bay is not Pirate Bay, and I wouldn't be over
[2271.52 --> 2272.32]  there using it.
[2272.60 --> 2278.70]  So in my mind, if you're still using Pirate Bay, are you even going to notice the CPU spike?
[2278.72 --> 2279.04]  Right.
[2279.28 --> 2281.18]  Are you going to know of an alternative?
[2281.88 --> 2283.18]  Are you just stuck with it?
[2284.48 --> 2284.96]  Yeah.
[2284.96 --> 2290.50]  If you're using it at this point, I guess you're either very loyal or don't know a better option.
[2291.18 --> 2291.94]  Loyal to what?
[2291.98 --> 2292.40]  A logo?
[2293.12 --> 2298.10]  Loyal to, I know this, I like what I can get from here, and I haven't looked elsewhere.
[2299.22 --> 2300.80]  Like any other brand loyalty.
[2301.22 --> 2302.90]  You were talking about Apple a few minutes ago.
[2302.98 --> 2305.14]  Yeah, I was talking about Apple a few minutes ago.
[2305.14 --> 2310.90]  This CoinHive JavaScript miner has definitely been used before.
[2311.04 --> 2312.78]  We've talked about a similar story.
[2312.86 --> 2314.26]  I don't remember what website.
[2314.42 --> 2316.48]  I don't think it was a site at this kind of scale, though.
[2316.56 --> 2318.18]  No, I don't even remember what it was.
[2318.26 --> 2322.04]  Like it might have been, I feel like it had something to do with Minecraft or, I don't
[2322.04 --> 2322.24]  know.
[2322.36 --> 2324.46]  But like, it's been used before for sure.
[2324.98 --> 2327.72]  Like here, I'm bringing up, is it .org these days?
[2327.96 --> 2328.94]  I don't know.
[2328.94 --> 2329.74]  I can't remember.
[2329.90 --> 2335.74]  But okay, so bringing it up on Alexa, which is an inherently flawed data collection method.
[2337.10 --> 2340.96]  Apparently, they're like in the top 100 sites.
[2341.32 --> 2341.70]  Wow.
[2342.00 --> 2342.16]  Yeah.
[2342.44 --> 2343.70]  Global rank 89.
[2344.46 --> 2344.72]  Okay?
[2344.94 --> 2349.86]  If you check trafficestimate.com or Quantcast, you'll get a pretty accurate picture.
[2350.78 --> 2353.36]  Okay, so let's throw it over there as well.
[2355.74 --> 2356.82]  Thepiratebay.org.
[2357.90 --> 2358.84]  Isn't it .se?
[2359.94 --> 2361.18]  Probably changes.
[2361.56 --> 2362.42]  Yeah, probably changes.
[2362.50 --> 2363.30]  Holy crap.
[2363.86 --> 2373.04]  Estimated monthly traffic visits in the 70 million range per month.
[2374.02 --> 2377.90]  That's bigger than Onantech when it was like at its peak.
[2378.00 --> 2379.10]  It was about 40 million page.
[2379.14 --> 2382.88]  Well, it's somewhere around there, but they were at 40 million page views per month for
[2382.88 --> 2383.20]  a while.
[2383.24 --> 2383.48]  Wow.
[2384.16 --> 2385.90]  Like just to give you a sense of scale.
[2385.90 --> 2388.70]  This also has it at an Alexa rank of 136.
[2388.94 --> 2392.18]  So like, I don't know how up to date any of this data is.
[2392.22 --> 2395.00]  The point is, it's a big site.
[2395.68 --> 2399.64]  And if you were hitting, like let's say half of the people noticed.
[2399.64 --> 2406.90]  If you were hitting 25, 30 million machines for, and it runs as long as the tab is open somewhere
[2406.90 --> 2407.48]  in your browser.
[2407.88 --> 2408.52]  So you might just leave it alone.
[2408.52 --> 2409.88]  For even a few hours a day.
[2411.76 --> 2414.46]  Even for that 24 hour period, that's pretty good.
[2414.88 --> 2415.16]  Yeah.
[2415.16 --> 2417.30]  You might have hit a couple million systems.
[2417.98 --> 2418.26]  Yeah.
[2418.40 --> 2421.06]  And you just go to sleep and wake up with...
[2421.06 --> 2421.66]  Well, it's like a...
[2421.66 --> 2426.52]  It's basically they've built a botnet to mine that they don't even have to install malware
[2426.52 --> 2426.94]  on.
[2428.52 --> 2429.26]  Unless you...
[2429.26 --> 2429.88]  Yeah, right.
[2430.78 --> 2431.06]  Right.
[2431.06 --> 2436.30]  So it's like brilliant in that way, but it's also like supremely dickish.
[2436.76 --> 2437.24]  So I think...
[2437.24 --> 2437.42]  Yeah.
[2437.70 --> 2438.92]  And I...
[2438.92 --> 2440.48]  I mean, you're in that community.
[2440.68 --> 2441.80]  So like, I don't know.
[2442.86 --> 2443.30]  Is...
[2443.30 --> 2443.56]  Okay.
[2443.84 --> 2445.86]  Last discussion point around this.
[2446.34 --> 2448.04]  Are you getting your just desserts for pirating?
[2448.04 --> 2449.04]  Like...
[2449.04 --> 2451.74]  I don't know that I have a comment on that.
[2452.06 --> 2452.28]  Yeah.
[2452.42 --> 2452.94]  Are you sure?
[2453.22 --> 2453.62]  You're not...
[2453.62 --> 2454.48]  Come on.
[2454.54 --> 2455.12]  It's a LAN show.
[2455.16 --> 2456.32]  No one holds you to anything you say on the show.
[2456.32 --> 2457.20]  I don't think it's...
[2457.20 --> 2461.02]  I don't think it's necessarily just because I think it would have to be in a different direction.
[2461.02 --> 2462.16]  I think it's...
[2462.16 --> 2464.38]  Justice relies on a fair trial, blah, blah, blah.
[2464.56 --> 2465.12]  So...
[2465.12 --> 2465.90]  Blah, blah, blah.
[2466.02 --> 2466.70]  Legal system.
[2466.82 --> 2467.28]  Yeah, exactly.
[2467.54 --> 2472.12]  But I think it's like you're in like the undercity and you're trying to pickpocket something
[2472.12 --> 2475.80]  and someone's in your pocket too and things are just happening.
[2475.80 --> 2481.22]  So you're painting the pirate as the downtrodden like...
[2481.22 --> 2481.68]  No, no, no.
[2481.80 --> 2483.86]  Like, like, you know, like...
[2483.86 --> 2487.24]  The Jedi's go down to the undercity to do some shady stuff sometimes too.
[2488.86 --> 2490.42]  Sometimes good people go down there.
[2490.58 --> 2492.84]  I'm having a hard time following your analogy here.
[2492.84 --> 2493.30]  I think so.
[2493.64 --> 2494.52]  I...
[2494.52 --> 2495.70]  There are...
[2495.70 --> 2502.14]  If you go to like the shady part of town to buy some like lifted item and something bad
[2502.14 --> 2503.18]  happens to you while you're there.
[2503.56 --> 2505.40]  Like you didn't ask for it to happen but like...
[2505.40 --> 2505.60]  Nope.
[2505.80 --> 2506.46]  At the same time...
[2506.46 --> 2507.60]  But you also could have avoided it.
[2507.62 --> 2509.06]  You probably could have avoided it.
[2509.16 --> 2509.92]  But then...
[2509.92 --> 2510.30]  And I don't feel...
[2510.30 --> 2512.22]  Then now we can bring up the Sony Rootkit thing.
[2513.60 --> 2519.16]  Could you have avoided it by going to the shiny store that's well lit on the main street...
[2519.16 --> 2519.70]  See, but then I feel bad.
[2519.70 --> 2520.50]  And buying it.
[2520.70 --> 2521.54]  Then I feel bad.
[2522.44 --> 2524.22]  But also from the...
[2525.66 --> 2526.00]  I don't know.
[2526.10 --> 2529.24]  I think there are valid uses for torrents for one.
[2529.44 --> 2529.64]  Yeah.
[2529.64 --> 2531.48]  They're not as widespread probably.
[2531.68 --> 2533.44]  At least not publicly known.
[2534.06 --> 2535.76]  So there's valid reasons to use them.
[2536.26 --> 2538.38]  There are people who are visiting the site who...
[2538.38 --> 2540.06]  We've used torrent.
[2540.30 --> 2540.52]  Mm-hmm.
[2540.74 --> 2542.48]  We've distributed files.
[2542.64 --> 2542.78]  Yeah.
[2542.86 --> 2543.60]  Patching games.
[2543.84 --> 2544.94]  Especially way back in the day.
[2545.04 --> 2545.64]  I know...
[2545.64 --> 2546.68]  I think it was Eve client.
[2546.90 --> 2548.30]  The best way to download it for a long time was...
[2548.30 --> 2552.82]  Blizzard couldn't possibly have afforded dedicated servers in the early days of WoW.
[2553.20 --> 2553.56]  You know?
[2556.72 --> 2558.28]  With all that StarCraft money.
[2558.36 --> 2558.56]  Yeah.
[2558.90 --> 2560.30]  With all that WoW money.
[2560.46 --> 2562.42]  You could turn off the peer-to-peer downloading.
[2562.62 --> 2562.84]  Okay.
[2562.94 --> 2563.22]  So sorry.
[2563.26 --> 2563.54]  Go ahead.
[2563.60 --> 2566.40]  You were going to say something and then you were kind of letting us talk over you so
[2566.40 --> 2567.12]  that you could avoid it.
[2567.18 --> 2568.94]  So I'm not letting that happen again.
[2569.44 --> 2570.90]  I wasn't trying to avoid it.
[2570.90 --> 2573.36]  I think there are...
[2573.36 --> 2576.24]  People may be visiting the site for reasons that are not...
[2576.24 --> 2578.76]  That don't involve torrenting or stealing software.
[2578.88 --> 2579.56]  I see.
[2579.66 --> 2579.92]  You know?
[2580.12 --> 2582.84]  What if I'm researching a story, right?
[2583.76 --> 2585.28]  And I go there and I'm affected.
[2585.28 --> 2588.26]  I feel really bad for the four people that that affects.
[2588.36 --> 2588.64]  Yeah.
[2589.38 --> 2589.80]  Me too.
[2589.88 --> 2590.56]  Those four people are like...
[2590.56 --> 2591.82]  You talk about Far Cry, right?
[2592.36 --> 2598.22]  Maybe whenever Star Wars Battlefront 2 came out more than a decade ago, I had the disc.
[2598.22 --> 2601.94]  It didn't work because it had whatever security crap on it.
[2602.02 --> 2603.84]  And so I had to download the game.
[2604.32 --> 2605.92]  But I had a valid serial number.
[2605.92 --> 2607.98]  So to me, that was a justified use.
[2608.12 --> 2608.46]  Absolutely.
[2608.60 --> 2609.62]  Because I paid for it.
[2609.68 --> 2609.88]  Sure.
[2609.88 --> 2610.32]  It should work.
[2610.42 --> 2611.84]  Especially if you put in the serial number.
[2612.16 --> 2612.38]  Yeah.
[2612.68 --> 2612.84]  Yeah.
[2613.08 --> 2614.98]  That's not even...
[2614.98 --> 2620.00]  So I don't know that it's as simple as an eye for an eye in this instance.
[2620.32 --> 2620.54]  No.
[2620.74 --> 2621.40]  No, it's not.
[2621.56 --> 2627.92]  So the collateral damage argument, the fact that it is not just if it is not...
[2628.48 --> 2630.20]  You know, if there's no justice system.
[2630.24 --> 2630.46]  Yeah.
[2630.46 --> 2630.54]  Yeah.
[2631.14 --> 2631.92]  So, okay.
[2631.96 --> 2632.94]  We're in agreement then.
[2633.20 --> 2634.62]  They're gigantic dicks.
[2635.62 --> 2636.06]  Right.
[2636.28 --> 2636.84]  Okay, cool.
[2637.32 --> 2639.28]  Speaking of gigantic dicks, Riley.
[2639.62 --> 2640.02]  Oh.
[2640.46 --> 2641.74]  Please come join us.
[2641.86 --> 2642.30]  Wow.
[2643.22 --> 2643.84]  That's harsh.
[2643.84 --> 2646.78]  Well, I could have meant that you're really well endowed.
[2646.96 --> 2647.34]  I didn't...
[2647.34 --> 2647.76]  Yeah, that's true.
[2647.76 --> 2649.04]  Thank you so much, Linus.
[2649.08 --> 2649.82]  That's so nice.
[2650.36 --> 2651.58]  Such a nice thing to say.
[2652.48 --> 2654.18]  Such an awkward thing to say.
[2655.74 --> 2657.58]  So, introduce yourself.
[2657.58 --> 2659.16]  Hi, I'm Riley.
[2659.48 --> 2662.14]  I'm from a channel called NCIX Tech Tips.
[2662.34 --> 2665.42]  You've probably never heard of it, Linus.
[2666.14 --> 2670.36]  We make videos about computers, sort of like you, but...
[2670.36 --> 2673.80]  Sort of in the style of Linus, but he's gone now.
[2673.94 --> 2674.72]  Yeah, yeah.
[2675.32 --> 2675.80]  Mentally.
[2679.04 --> 2681.10]  Look, I feel like I...
[2681.10 --> 2683.38]  When you have kids, you'll understand.
[2683.86 --> 2686.20]  Yeah, no, I'm going to be calling you up for advice.
[2686.20 --> 2689.96]  Yep, my advice, just get the operation now.
[2690.16 --> 2690.34]  Okay.
[2690.54 --> 2691.10]  No, I'm just kidding.
[2691.18 --> 2691.76]  I love my kids.
[2691.86 --> 2692.28]  They're wonderful.
[2692.44 --> 2693.86]  If my kids are ever watching this in the future...
[2693.86 --> 2695.18]  No, I already told you advice.
[2695.32 --> 2695.94]  I already told you advice.
[2696.10 --> 2699.76]  This is going to end up being like one of those things where you say,
[2699.86 --> 2703.44]  look, like I'm not saying, you know, Hitler was, you know, or whatever.
[2703.52 --> 2704.14]  I didn't say it.
[2704.16 --> 2704.90]  I didn't say it, see?
[2705.18 --> 2706.88]  But where people take the clip, right?
[2707.28 --> 2707.72]  Why?
[2708.38 --> 2709.78]  They take it out of the context.
[2709.78 --> 2710.16]  You're asking for it.
[2710.36 --> 2710.96]  Oh, you know what?
[2711.00 --> 2712.50]  Actually, I'm going to kick you off for a second.
[2712.50 --> 2712.74]  Okay.
[2712.74 --> 2715.38]  Because I'm sure you want nothing to do with our, like, sponsors and stuff.
[2715.40 --> 2715.58]  Yeah, okay.
[2715.58 --> 2716.22]  See you later.
[2716.32 --> 2716.96]  So you'll be back.
[2717.06 --> 2717.96]  You'll be back in a second.
[2718.62 --> 2720.00]  I promise I'll bring you back.
[2720.18 --> 2722.04]  I didn't just bring you in for that.
[2722.20 --> 2723.12]  Right in front of the camera.
[2723.38 --> 2724.50]  Right in front of the camera.
[2725.00 --> 2725.32]  Brilliant.
[2725.90 --> 2727.02]  It's like he makes videos.
[2727.34 --> 2729.40]  So our sponsors today, Squarespace.
[2731.22 --> 2732.14]  I wonder how...
[2732.14 --> 2732.60]  You know what?
[2732.74 --> 2734.34]  I'm going to go off...
[2734.34 --> 2735.26]  Actually, I'm not going to go off...
[2735.26 --> 2736.00]  Don't do it.
[2736.00 --> 2737.34]  There might be a difference.
[2737.50 --> 2739.30]  We're going to end up saying build it beautiful,
[2739.66 --> 2741.98]  which we're not allowed to say during our Squarespace spots.
[2741.98 --> 2744.86]  It's going to happen.
[2744.86 --> 2747.34]  Like three minutes have gone by and there's been two of them.
[2747.38 --> 2747.96]  It's going to happen.
[2747.96 --> 2748.62]  Come on!
[2749.40 --> 2750.64]  Pull it together, man.
[2750.72 --> 2751.04]  Squarespace.
[2751.36 --> 2753.96]  The place to go if you want to build a beautiful, simple website.
[2754.12 --> 2755.64]  It starts at just $12 a month.
[2755.72 --> 2757.82]  You get a free domain if you buy Squarespace for the year.
[2758.20 --> 2759.30]  It's super easy.
[2759.30 --> 2761.74]  Like if we were building Floatplane on Squarespace,
[2762.08 --> 2765.12]  it would be done like ages ago.
[2765.64 --> 2768.10]  All you got to do is you pick one of their templates.
[2768.60 --> 2771.20]  You like drag and drop pictures and text boxes.
[2771.48 --> 2773.12]  You populate everything and boom!
[2773.20 --> 2776.72]  You've got a beautiful website that works great across every device.
[2776.82 --> 2779.08]  And they've got tons of great features to make your life easy.
[2779.28 --> 2780.58]  Like their commerce module.
[2780.94 --> 2782.20]  Every website comes with a store.
[2782.52 --> 2786.00]  Their cover pages, which lets you set up a beautiful one-page presence in minutes.
[2786.00 --> 2786.40]  Squarespace.
[2786.40 --> 2789.26]  And, oh, you can publish content in Apple News format.
[2789.34 --> 2789.98]  No, that's not new.
[2790.18 --> 2791.78]  Directly from the Squarespace blog module.
[2791.88 --> 2792.98]  They've also got their logo designer.
[2793.18 --> 2794.06]  Basically, it's awesome.
[2794.54 --> 2798.46]  You can start a trial with no credit card required at squarespace.com slash when.
[2798.62 --> 2800.46]  Then, when you look at your site and you go,
[2800.56 --> 2802.22]  gee, I'd sure like to keep this.
[2802.94 --> 2804.48]  Well, you've got to start paying.
[2804.86 --> 2809.08]  And you can use offer code when to save 10% on Squarespace.
[2809.40 --> 2810.22]  On your first purchase.
[2810.50 --> 2811.38]  On your first purchase.
[2811.44 --> 2812.08]  Thank you for that.
[2812.24 --> 2812.70]  No worries.
[2812.78 --> 2814.30]  I genuinely thank you for that.
[2814.32 --> 2814.42]  I got you.
[2814.42 --> 2817.10]  Our second sponsor is iFixit.
[2817.60 --> 2819.34]  Do they really need an introduction?
[2819.96 --> 2820.36]  Yes.
[2820.36 --> 2823.82]  Apparently, they think they do because they're still sponsoring the WAN show.
[2823.84 --> 2824.80]  Thank you for needing an introduction.
[2825.20 --> 2826.12]  We love you guys.
[2826.36 --> 2827.52]  We really do.
[2827.82 --> 2829.96]  iFixit makes great products.
[2830.14 --> 2831.40]  We use them for the last week.
[2831.54 --> 2833.08]  They have great guides.
[2833.56 --> 2836.76]  So, if you want to be part of the right to repair revolution,
[2837.28 --> 2842.14]  or even if you don't care about that whole politicized sort of thing that's going on,
[2842.14 --> 2846.74]  and you're just going to, whether it's illegal or legal, you're just going to repair your stuff regardless,
[2847.24 --> 2848.42]  iFixit's got you covered.
[2848.52 --> 2850.04]  They've got guides for how to do it.
[2850.22 --> 2855.84]  They've got replacement hard-to-find parts, things like gaskets and adhesive seals,
[2856.08 --> 2859.40]  stuff that you otherwise wouldn't be able to put your device back together with,
[2859.40 --> 2861.98]  and they've got all the tools you need for disassembly.
[2862.32 --> 2866.90]  And their ProTech toolkit, which is awesome, is now only $60,
[2867.30 --> 2872.70]  including their 64-bit driver kit, all the prying and wedging tools you need to take apart almost anything,
[2872.92 --> 2878.08]  their suction cups, their flex extension, and it's awesome.
[2878.08 --> 2884.46]  So, basically, head over to iFixit.com slash Linus and snag a ProTech toolkit for just $60.
[2885.24 --> 2889.66]  Odds are, you'll spend less on your ProTech toolkit than you would have on a single repair,
[2890.00 --> 2892.32]  taking it to a shop to have somebody else do it for you.
[2892.44 --> 2894.40]  And then you'll be equipped for the future.
[2895.68 --> 2897.06]  Leading us to our last monster.
[2898.56 --> 2901.90]  Hold on, hold on, no nip slip!
[2901.90 --> 2903.90]  No nip slip!
[2904.62 --> 2905.26]  Inappropriate!
[2905.48 --> 2909.14]  Hold on, hold on, we're keeping it nip slip free.
[2909.50 --> 2910.56]  We're trying, we're trying.
[2910.64 --> 2911.04]  We're trying!
[2912.10 --> 2912.68]  Oh no!
[2912.68 --> 2913.08]  Yeah!
[2914.46 --> 2915.42]  Did it!
[2915.92 --> 2916.52]  Heck yeah.
[2916.74 --> 2918.20]  Mack Weldon!
[2918.92 --> 2920.34]  I'm still really enjoying my job with the Pro.
[2920.34 --> 2922.90]  So, Mack Weldon, tons of comfortable clothes,
[2922.98 --> 2926.54]  whether we're talking underwear, socks, shirts, undershirts, hoodies, sweatpants,
[2926.54 --> 2928.82]  they are so confident you're going to love them,
[2928.82 --> 2932.48]  that if you order, they will actually,
[2932.56 --> 2934.04]  so you order like a pair of boxers.
[2934.28 --> 2936.84]  If you don't like your first pair, you can keep it,
[2936.94 --> 2938.30]  and they will still refund you.
[2938.58 --> 2939.70]  No questions asked.
[2940.24 --> 2942.74]  Best thing about Mack Weldon, for me personally,
[2942.86 --> 2946.18]  as someone who sweats a bit, you know,
[2946.34 --> 2949.66]  it's not really sweat, it's more of like a glow, you know?
[2949.72 --> 2950.16]  Okay.
[2950.40 --> 2950.92]  Healthy glow.
[2951.16 --> 2951.40]  Wow.
[2952.34 --> 2955.26]  They have a line of silver underwear and shirts
[2955.26 --> 2956.92]  that are naturally antimicrobial.
[2956.92 --> 2960.24]  That's what silver does, which, if you guys know much about sweat,
[2960.38 --> 2961.98]  is what causes it to smell,
[2962.54 --> 2966.94]  and so they are naturally, actually, odor-killing,
[2967.14 --> 2969.06]  which is pretty cool.
[2969.56 --> 2971.54]  So, go over to MackWeldon.com
[2971.54 --> 2975.02]  and use offer code TECHTIPS to save 20%.
[2975.02 --> 2975.58]  20%.
[2975.58 --> 2976.38]  Go check it out.
[2976.50 --> 2976.92]  It's pretty good.
[2976.96 --> 2979.54]  Comfy clothes, and you won't smell as bad as me.
[2980.68 --> 2982.62]  Unless I'm also wearing Mack Weldon.
[2983.18 --> 2984.90]  Then again, if you don't sweat as much as me,
[2985.36 --> 2987.36]  then like, I mean, it's not magic.
[2987.58 --> 2988.54]  It's antimicrobial.
[2988.66 --> 2991.70]  It's not like, it's not like a freaking chemical bath.
[2994.02 --> 2997.28]  How many times do you think you've shown your audience
[2997.28 --> 2998.38]  your nipples at this point?
[2998.84 --> 3000.26]  Actually, very well, okay.
[3000.50 --> 3002.36]  Because I feel like I've personally seen them.
[3002.46 --> 3003.32]  I think he's gone out of his way.
[3003.36 --> 3003.58]  Yeah.
[3003.68 --> 3004.82]  Like a number of times.
[3004.90 --> 3006.88]  He's like, oh, here, oh, I can show my nipples here.
[3007.10 --> 3007.34]  Yeah.
[3007.34 --> 3008.22]  They're okay nipples.
[3008.42 --> 3009.20]  They're great nipples.
[3009.28 --> 3010.50]  I mean, they're not like, you know,
[3010.58 --> 3012.50]  they're not like really disgusting or anything.
[3012.78 --> 3013.40]  So, like, I'm not.
[3013.60 --> 3014.04]  They're fine.
[3014.06 --> 3016.36]  I remember even one of our first recruitment videos.
[3016.36 --> 3018.06]  Like, I was like, yeah, I'm just going to wear my boxers.
[3018.18 --> 3018.38]  Yeah.
[3018.72 --> 3019.20]  That's it.
[3019.24 --> 3020.88]  Like, I wrote that portion of the video
[3020.88 --> 3022.68]  where Ed comes out with a laptop
[3022.68 --> 3025.60]  and he's just like, okay, Linus,
[3025.62 --> 3027.38]  are you ready for the shoot that...
[3027.38 --> 3030.30]  And I'm just like in my boxers with sunglasses on
[3030.30 --> 3032.02]  holding like two MP5s.
[3032.24 --> 3032.46]  Yeah.
[3032.74 --> 3034.32]  And he's just like, no, no.
[3034.32 --> 3035.44]  And I'm just like, what?
[3035.64 --> 3035.92]  What?
[3036.28 --> 3038.34]  That seems like an Ivan move.
[3038.64 --> 3039.04]  Yeah.
[3039.56 --> 3040.04]  MP5s.
[3040.04 --> 3041.18]  So we were just trying to have some...
[3041.18 --> 3042.72]  It's so weird that they used to work together
[3042.72 --> 3044.76]  for a long time and now it's two again.
[3044.94 --> 3045.30]  Wow.
[3045.46 --> 3046.16]  So interesting.
[3046.42 --> 3046.94]  Oh my goodness.
[3046.94 --> 3048.04]  Who would have seen that coming?
[3048.86 --> 3050.14]  Not a similar sense of humor.
[3050.48 --> 3052.24]  Let's jump right into this.
[3052.30 --> 3053.18]  Have you had a look at this?
[3053.22 --> 3053.70]  Have you seen this?
[3053.70 --> 3054.32]  Have you heard about this?
[3054.54 --> 3056.78]  Google buys HTC,
[3056.90 --> 3059.28]  but it's a little more complicated than that.
[3059.34 --> 3061.66]  So the original article here is from Android Central.
[3061.80 --> 3063.12]  1.1 billion?
[3063.12 --> 3065.88]  Basically for the right to hire people?
[3066.24 --> 3067.92]  You know, I don't know.
[3068.00 --> 3069.56]  I feel like they...
[3069.56 --> 3071.10]  Who did they hire?
[3071.24 --> 3072.00]  Motorola before?
[3072.32 --> 3073.56]  Well, they bought Motorola.
[3073.56 --> 3074.28]  Motorola, yeah.
[3074.38 --> 3075.68]  And then flipped them to Lenovo.
[3075.68 --> 3076.26]  And then they flipped them over.
[3076.42 --> 3077.86]  So I feel like maybe they were like,
[3078.20 --> 3080.94]  okay, we tried buying a phone company before
[3080.94 --> 3081.78]  and it didn't work out.
[3081.82 --> 3083.40]  Well, maybe the issue was that they bought Motorola.
[3084.16 --> 3085.74]  Who hadn't done anything relevant.
[3086.00 --> 3087.54]  I mean, okay, lots of patents.
[3087.54 --> 3088.84]  Mm-hmm.
[3088.84 --> 3089.16]  Mm-hmm.
[3089.48 --> 3090.44]  But...
[3090.44 --> 3092.70]  Okay, so this is at...
[3092.70 --> 3095.78]  It affects apparently about 2,000 employees.
[3095.88 --> 3097.10]  The reason why I'm stuttering is
[3097.10 --> 3100.14]  this deal is to be able to hire them
[3100.14 --> 3103.70]  at a cost of about $550,000 per employee.
[3104.04 --> 3105.84]  These are some primo employees.
[3106.24 --> 3106.64]  Yeah.
[3106.64 --> 3108.80]  They are the best employees.
[3108.80 --> 3109.48]  They're silver lions.
[3109.48 --> 3110.64]  They're the best employees.
[3110.76 --> 3111.30]  You're waiting.
[3112.84 --> 3114.64]  You've never seen employees like this.
[3116.96 --> 3117.64]  Trust me.
[3117.64 --> 3118.54]  Now, to be clear,
[3118.70 --> 3121.20]  this also gives them a non-exclusive license
[3121.20 --> 3122.98]  to HTC's intellectual property.
[3123.72 --> 3124.88]  Now, I suspect...
[3124.88 --> 3125.84]  If I had to guess,
[3126.26 --> 3127.64]  based on that HTC's...
[3127.64 --> 3127.96]  Non-exclusive.
[3129.16 --> 3130.72]  Non-exclusive is fine
[3130.72 --> 3132.90]  because from what I can tell,
[3133.14 --> 3135.32]  Google doesn't want HTC to go out of business.
[3135.32 --> 3135.92]  Hmm.
[3136.32 --> 3137.18]  So they're not going to, like,
[3137.28 --> 3138.82]  exclusively license everything
[3138.82 --> 3139.52]  and hire...
[3139.52 --> 3139.92]  What is it?
[3139.94 --> 3141.08]  I think it's about half of their staff.
[3141.26 --> 3141.60]  Is that right?
[3141.70 --> 3142.12]  Is it half?
[3142.18 --> 3142.44]  I don't know.
[3142.50 --> 3143.50]  I think it's something like that.
[3143.58 --> 3144.74]  Don't quote me on that one, though,
[3144.74 --> 3146.86]  but it's a significant number of their staff.
[3147.38 --> 3148.96]  They don't want them to go out of business
[3148.96 --> 3150.96]  because they still...
[3150.96 --> 3152.30]  I believe they still intend
[3152.30 --> 3154.00]  to contract manufacture with HTC.
[3154.08 --> 3154.82]  They are not acquiring
[3154.82 --> 3155.92]  any of the manufacturing.
[3156.26 --> 3156.50]  Right.
[3157.18 --> 3158.22]  I wonder if the employees
[3158.22 --> 3159.84]  get any of the cash
[3159.84 --> 3160.50]  from their, like,
[3160.54 --> 3162.30]  right to be sold like cattle agreement.
[3162.30 --> 3163.72]  I super bet not.
[3163.72 --> 3165.52]  Like, this is so weird.
[3165.58 --> 3165.86]  Yeah, yeah.
[3165.96 --> 3166.94]  It's like they're paying...
[3166.94 --> 3168.00]  Google's paying HTC
[3168.00 --> 3169.72]  for the right to pay the employees
[3169.72 --> 3171.24]  their wage.
[3171.98 --> 3172.66]  But whether...
[3172.66 --> 3173.72]  They don't get anything out of it.
[3174.02 --> 3175.48]  Whether HTC
[3175.48 --> 3177.46]  has made anything relevant
[3177.46 --> 3179.10]  in the last three years or not,
[3179.18 --> 3180.32]  they own...
[3180.32 --> 3181.72]  Look at the squeezy thing.
[3182.86 --> 3183.44]  Sorry, go ahead.
[3183.44 --> 3187.06]  They own a ton of cell phone IP
[3187.06 --> 3190.26]  because they were the OG Android
[3190.26 --> 3191.68]  cell phone manufacturer.
[3192.44 --> 3195.62]  So one of the biggest challenges
[3195.62 --> 3197.12]  around building a product
[3197.12 --> 3198.60]  is not figuring out
[3198.60 --> 3199.44]  how to build a product.
[3199.70 --> 3200.84]  One of the biggest challenges
[3200.84 --> 3201.88]  is figuring out
[3201.88 --> 3202.74]  how to build a product
[3202.74 --> 3203.84]  without infringing
[3203.84 --> 3205.98]  on an 800-pound gorilla
[3205.98 --> 3208.50]  who's gonna just
[3208.50 --> 3209.70]  lawsuit you
[3209.70 --> 3211.26]  into the dirt
[3211.26 --> 3212.82]  for building something
[3212.82 --> 3213.90]  that happens
[3213.90 --> 3215.08]  to infringe on their patent
[3215.08 --> 3216.14]  even if you developed
[3216.14 --> 3216.74]  it independently.
[3217.98 --> 3219.26]  I mean, that's why
[3219.26 --> 3220.62]  it's pretty much impossible
[3220.62 --> 3221.54]  for anyone else
[3221.54 --> 3222.12]  to show up
[3222.12 --> 3222.74]  and become
[3222.74 --> 3224.46]  a GPU manufacturer
[3224.46 --> 3225.08]  at this point.
[3225.92 --> 3226.72]  It's like, done.
[3226.96 --> 3227.60]  Intel tried.
[3227.90 --> 3229.10]  And if Intel can't do it,
[3229.34 --> 3229.98]  quite frankly,
[3231.00 --> 3231.74]  well, maybe Apple
[3231.74 --> 3232.44]  could still do it.
[3232.44 --> 3234.02]  My question is...
[3234.02 --> 3235.64]  But, other than that,
[3236.28 --> 3236.96]  I don't think so.
[3237.18 --> 3238.04]  My question is,
[3238.10 --> 3238.72]  how many times
[3238.72 --> 3240.34]  is Google going to do this
[3240.34 --> 3242.20]  when an Android phone manufacturer
[3242.20 --> 3242.86]  is struggling?
[3243.26 --> 3244.38]  Because when they bought Motorola,
[3244.48 --> 3245.64]  Motorola was basically
[3245.64 --> 3247.44]  almost irrelevant.
[3248.12 --> 3248.52]  And then,
[3248.94 --> 3250.06]  if they hadn't been bought,
[3250.70 --> 3251.66]  they would have been done.
[3251.76 --> 3252.14]  But now,
[3252.24 --> 3253.06]  they're doing great again.
[3253.36 --> 3253.98]  Well, sort of.
[3254.48 --> 3255.62]  But like, you know...
[3255.62 --> 3256.18]  Yeah.
[3256.64 --> 3257.22]  You're seeing...
[3257.22 --> 3257.80]  I wouldn't be surprised
[3257.80 --> 3258.48]  if it kept happening.
[3258.50 --> 3260.10]  Remember, it's really hard to tell
[3260.10 --> 3261.50]  if a Chinese-backed company
[3261.50 --> 3262.28]  is doing great,
[3262.28 --> 3262.48]  though.
[3262.48 --> 3262.76]  Well, okay.
[3262.84 --> 3263.92]  I don't know their numbers.
[3264.04 --> 3265.84]  Because they could just be getting...
[3265.84 --> 3266.76]  Like, you could be seeing
[3266.76 --> 3267.82]  all these ads
[3267.82 --> 3269.58]  and all these new products
[3269.58 --> 3270.60]  and all this stuff.
[3270.74 --> 3272.36]  But it could be just literally
[3272.36 --> 3273.50]  Chinese government money
[3273.50 --> 3275.10]  just paying for all of it.
[3275.20 --> 3275.46]  True.
[3276.22 --> 3277.10]  And then just buying
[3277.10 --> 3278.18]  the inventory off the shelves
[3278.18 --> 3278.92]  when it's done
[3278.92 --> 3280.12]  and burying it in a hole
[3280.12 --> 3280.86]  like we don't know.
[3281.90 --> 3283.04]  Or incinerating it.
[3284.34 --> 3285.66]  And then creating rain
[3285.66 --> 3287.08]  to wash it out of the air.
[3288.34 --> 3289.18]  Like we don't know.
[3289.56 --> 3289.78]  Yeah.
[3290.04 --> 3290.96]  No, that's fair.
[3290.96 --> 3291.90]  But in terms of like
[3291.90 --> 3292.76]  brand awareness,
[3293.12 --> 3294.08]  I mean, I know that
[3294.08 --> 3295.30]  I've been hearing a lot more
[3295.30 --> 3297.92]  about like the Moto G series
[3297.92 --> 3298.46]  and stuff.
[3298.60 --> 3298.74]  Right.
[3298.94 --> 3300.44]  They kind of found a niche
[3300.44 --> 3301.92]  as like this budget thing.
[3302.02 --> 3303.76]  Like my brother-in-law has one.
[3303.90 --> 3304.64]  I think they're killing it
[3304.64 --> 3305.32]  in India, too.
[3305.52 --> 3305.80]  Right.
[3305.94 --> 3306.16]  Yeah.
[3306.24 --> 3307.58]  Is my understanding anyway.
[3307.68 --> 3308.40]  I could be wrong about that.
[3308.40 --> 3309.14]  So like, is the same thing
[3309.14 --> 3310.44]  going to happen with HTC?
[3310.78 --> 3312.06]  Like, buy...
[3312.06 --> 3313.30]  They didn't buy the whole company.
[3313.40 --> 3314.10]  They bought part of it.
[3314.12 --> 3315.50]  But like, I don't know.
[3315.54 --> 3316.22]  It's going to be interesting
[3316.22 --> 3317.06]  to see whether it actually
[3317.06 --> 3317.82]  saves them or not.
[3318.12 --> 3318.38]  Right.
[3318.38 --> 3319.40]  I love HTC.
[3319.48 --> 3320.34]  I kind of have an emotional
[3320.34 --> 3321.06]  connection to them
[3321.06 --> 3321.88]  because they're...
[3321.88 --> 3322.74]  Did you ever see
[3322.74 --> 3323.56]  that original commercial
[3323.56 --> 3324.38]  with like with the...
[3325.40 --> 3326.36]  We are you.
[3326.54 --> 3326.96]  And you.
[3327.16 --> 3327.54]  And you.
[3327.72 --> 3328.48]  I think so, yeah.
[3328.50 --> 3329.38]  And the piano is like...
[3329.38 --> 3332.78]  Anyways, I like that commercial.
[3334.46 --> 3334.96]  That's the moral of that story.
[3334.96 --> 3335.72]  So because of that commercial,
[3335.84 --> 3336.78]  I don't want them to go in.
[3336.78 --> 3337.18]  Yeah, yeah.
[3337.20 --> 3338.46]  It's probably from a PR firm
[3338.46 --> 3340.10]  that hired an ad agency,
[3340.26 --> 3340.64]  but whatever.
[3340.78 --> 3340.98]  Yeah.
[3341.12 --> 3342.02]  My first Android phone
[3342.02 --> 3342.64]  was an HTC.
[3342.74 --> 3343.04]  I don't know.
[3343.18 --> 3343.28]  I just...
[3343.28 --> 3343.66]  There we go.
[3343.66 --> 3344.04]  Okay.
[3344.28 --> 3345.84]  Now, speaking of the feels
[3345.84 --> 3347.24]  from when you were a kid,
[3347.40 --> 3348.22]  this original article
[3348.22 --> 3349.74]  is from BBC.com.
[3351.24 --> 3352.68]  Toys R Us.
[3352.80 --> 3353.44]  Toys R Us.
[3353.56 --> 3355.26]  Files for bankruptcy protection
[3355.26 --> 3356.94]  in the U.S. and Canada.
[3357.68 --> 3358.10]  Damn.
[3359.78 --> 3360.22]  Wow.
[3360.70 --> 3361.22]  64.
[3361.88 --> 3362.48]  What?
[3362.48 --> 3363.68]  I go there all the time.
[3363.70 --> 3365.90]  64,000 employees they have.
[3366.20 --> 3367.30]  Like, I wanted to start
[3367.30 --> 3368.06]  like, I wanted to start
[3368.06 --> 3368.96]  a GoFundMe for real.
[3369.26 --> 3370.74]  GoFundMe for Toys R Us.
[3371.10 --> 3372.14]  I think they're in the hole
[3372.14 --> 3372.96]  four billion.
[3372.96 --> 3373.94]  Four billion?
[3374.40 --> 3375.36]  Four billion?
[3375.48 --> 3376.28]  Four billion, I think.
[3376.28 --> 3377.26]  We can do it, guys.
[3378.38 --> 3379.26]  Can we raise...
[3379.26 --> 3381.20]  If every person on Earth,
[3381.86 --> 3382.44]  legitimately,
[3382.72 --> 3384.18]  every single one of them
[3384.18 --> 3385.96]  contributed 50 cents.
[3386.40 --> 3386.92]  We need a Sarah...
[3386.92 --> 3387.88]  We need a Sarah McLachlan commercial.
[3388.14 --> 3388.38]  Yeah.
[3388.58 --> 3388.76]  Yeah.
[3390.08 --> 3391.26]  Look in the eyes...
[3391.26 --> 3391.80]  Look in the eyes
[3391.80 --> 3393.06]  of this Batman action figure.
[3393.48 --> 3395.32]  So a U.S. bankruptcy judge
[3395.32 --> 3396.12]  approved a loan
[3396.12 --> 3397.26]  of more than two billion
[3397.26 --> 3398.72]  to help stabilize the toy chain.
[3398.82 --> 3399.06]  And I mean,
[3399.14 --> 3400.10]  I love Toys R Us
[3400.10 --> 3400.78]  as much as anyone,
[3401.44 --> 3402.82]  but why is anybody
[3402.82 --> 3404.20]  giving gigantic
[3404.20 --> 3405.78]  big box retail chains
[3405.78 --> 3407.02]  billion dollar loans?
[3407.04 --> 3407.46]  I was gonna say,
[3407.54 --> 3408.18]  this is just another
[3408.18 --> 3409.44]  Amazon-created corpse.
[3410.08 --> 3410.28]  Mm.
[3410.50 --> 3410.90]  Like...
[3410.90 --> 3412.00]  Like, Amazon just murdered
[3412.00 --> 3412.58]  this company.
[3412.68 --> 3412.90]  Yep.
[3413.54 --> 3413.86]  Yep.
[3414.08 --> 3414.70]  I mean...
[3414.70 --> 3415.58]  Would you lend them
[3415.58 --> 3416.48]  two billion dollars?
[3416.60 --> 3416.90]  No.
[3418.90 --> 3419.76]  I'd have to get
[3419.76 --> 3420.70]  two billion dollars first.
[3421.44 --> 3422.34]  Clearly, they already...
[3422.34 --> 3423.92]  I'm not sure how
[3423.92 --> 3424.60]  to answer that question.
[3424.60 --> 3425.86]  The fact that they owe,
[3426.16 --> 3426.44]  you know,
[3426.56 --> 3427.76]  two billion dollars
[3427.76 --> 3429.60]  tells us everything
[3429.60 --> 3430.38]  we need to know
[3430.38 --> 3431.94]  about how the business
[3431.94 --> 3432.52]  is going.
[3433.48 --> 3433.84]  Billions!
[3434.38 --> 3434.72]  I mean,
[3434.82 --> 3435.94]  the stuff they sell
[3435.94 --> 3438.06]  is like 30 bucks.
[3438.76 --> 3439.56]  Well, I don't know.
[3439.66 --> 3440.32]  Lego, man?
[3440.70 --> 3441.70]  Okay, that's true.
[3441.90 --> 3442.76]  Lego's expensive.
[3443.24 --> 3443.42]  Yeah.
[3443.42 --> 3443.70]  Yeah.
[3444.08 --> 3445.34]  So in 2016,
[3445.84 --> 3447.64]  about 13.7%
[3447.64 --> 3448.50]  of all toy sales
[3448.50 --> 3449.34]  were online,
[3449.54 --> 3450.38]  and that's up
[3450.38 --> 3451.90]  six and a half percent
[3451.90 --> 3453.02]  from five years ago.
[3453.02 --> 3453.90]  That's in 2016?
[3454.38 --> 3455.10]  That's in 2016.
[3455.20 --> 3455.94]  That's last year.
[3456.08 --> 3456.86]  In countries where
[3456.86 --> 3458.28]  Amazon is not as big,
[3458.50 --> 3459.92]  so the UK,
[3460.26 --> 3461.20]  the EU in general,
[3461.46 --> 3461.80]  Asia,
[3462.00 --> 3462.68]  not included
[3462.68 --> 3463.30]  in the bankruptcy.
[3463.78 --> 3464.22]  Really?
[3464.54 --> 3465.50]  So it's just countries
[3465.50 --> 3466.72]  where Amazon is big.
[3466.80 --> 3467.44]  See, yeah.
[3467.44 --> 3467.68]  Because I wonder
[3467.68 --> 3468.72]  who killed Toys R Us.
[3469.34 --> 3470.16]  This is the thing
[3470.16 --> 3471.52]  about the rise of Amazon.
[3471.76 --> 3472.40]  It's like, you know,
[3472.94 --> 3473.94]  I just seen was saying
[3473.94 --> 3475.06]  she can order something
[3475.06 --> 3475.80]  and have it arrive
[3475.80 --> 3476.50]  in 15 minutes.
[3476.60 --> 3477.38]  We don't have that luxury
[3477.38 --> 3477.90]  here in Canada.
[3478.04 --> 3478.50]  No, not yet.
[3478.80 --> 3479.52]  But, you know...
[3479.52 --> 3480.02]  But it's like,
[3480.16 --> 3481.60]  it's the same day.
[3481.78 --> 3482.06]  Yeah.
[3482.06 --> 3483.52]  Maybe by 9pm,
[3483.60 --> 3484.38]  but it's the same day.
[3484.48 --> 3485.08]  But even here,
[3485.16 --> 3486.34]  it's like a couple days
[3486.34 --> 3487.38]  as long as it's got Prime.
[3487.42 --> 3488.08]  We have a lot less
[3488.08 --> 3488.74]  Prime selection,
[3489.22 --> 3490.46]  but I definitely get
[3490.46 --> 3491.06]  my money's worth
[3491.06 --> 3491.54]  over Prime.
[3491.56 --> 3492.62]  That's for free shipping.
[3492.80 --> 3493.70]  If you want to pay for it,
[3493.70 --> 3494.58]  you can get it by 9pm
[3494.58 --> 3495.14]  same day.
[3495.14 --> 3496.20]  As long as you order it
[3496.20 --> 3497.24]  before I think it's 11am
[3497.24 --> 3497.48]  or something.
[3497.48 --> 3498.18]  And it's just like,
[3498.28 --> 3500.64]  it's actually more...
[3500.64 --> 3501.98]  It takes less time
[3501.98 --> 3503.86]  out of my life
[3503.86 --> 3505.64]  by an order of magnitude
[3505.64 --> 3508.14]  to where I just...
[3508.14 --> 3510.02]  Like, if my kids
[3510.02 --> 3511.44]  have a stupid birthday party
[3511.44 --> 3512.04]  to go to.
[3512.60 --> 3513.06]  I just go...
[3513.06 --> 3513.54]  Amazon,
[3513.80 --> 3514.72]  top-selling toys,
[3515.16 --> 3516.08]  find something that doesn't
[3516.08 --> 3517.40]  look like plastic garbage,
[3518.14 --> 3518.64]  order it,
[3518.70 --> 3519.66]  and don't think about it
[3519.66 --> 3520.80]  anymore because my wife
[3520.80 --> 3521.30]  will wrap it.
[3521.60 --> 3521.92]  And also,
[3522.02 --> 3524.20]  you don't have to feel
[3524.20 --> 3525.24]  like kind of a weirdo
[3525.24 --> 3526.26]  walking into a toy store
[3526.26 --> 3527.18]  as a grown adult,
[3527.32 --> 3527.58]  you know?
[3527.66 --> 3528.88]  Like, this isn't for me.
[3529.28 --> 3530.02]  This is for me.
[3530.02 --> 3530.06]  This is for me.
[3530.06 --> 3531.72]  This is for my friend.
[3532.14 --> 3533.18]  This is for my friend.
[3533.32 --> 3534.10]  This is for my friend
[3534.10 --> 3534.98]  with a pedo stash.
[3535.28 --> 3536.04]  Yeah, exactly.
[3536.82 --> 3538.12]  Your pedo stash was great,
[3538.20 --> 3538.30]  by the way.
[3538.30 --> 3539.58]  I want to bring it back.
[3539.66 --> 3540.28]  You should bring back
[3540.28 --> 3540.48]  the pedo stash.
[3540.48 --> 3541.18]  Every time I shave,
[3541.26 --> 3542.22]  I just shave the whole thing
[3542.22 --> 3543.32]  and forget that I'm like,
[3543.36 --> 3544.22]  oh yeah, I want a stash.
[3544.26 --> 3545.00]  You know what?
[3545.06 --> 3545.84]  If you want to remember,
[3545.96 --> 3546.92]  just take like a big sharpie
[3546.92 --> 3547.72]  and just draw on here
[3547.72 --> 3549.10]  and then you'll see it
[3549.10 --> 3549.84]  until it grows over.
[3549.92 --> 3551.02]  And it'll look basically the same.
[3553.02 --> 3554.02]  Hey, it'll remind you.
[3555.08 --> 3556.36]  I've had that for a long time,
[3556.52 --> 3559.12]  but it's almost mainstream now.
[3559.26 --> 3560.32]  It's too, you know?
[3560.64 --> 3562.04]  I was a hipster when I had it.
[3562.04 --> 3562.36]  Yeah.
[3562.52 --> 3562.70]  Yeah.
[3562.80 --> 3563.08]  It's like,
[3563.14 --> 3564.02]  now you see a guy with a mustache,
[3564.16 --> 3564.40]  you're like,
[3564.40 --> 3565.60]  oh, it's not a mustache.
[3565.60 --> 3566.58]  Just a color dude with a mustache.
[3566.76 --> 3567.50]  All right.
[3567.92 --> 3569.78]  So, last topic of the day.
[3569.78 --> 3572.78]  This could change memes forever.
[3574.70 --> 3577.04]  Pepe the Frog's creator
[3577.04 --> 3580.92]  gets legal against the alt-right.
[3582.52 --> 3583.38]  So.
[3583.62 --> 3583.98]  Yes.
[3585.16 --> 3586.70]  The creator, Matt Fury,
[3587.00 --> 3587.88]  and his lawyers
[3587.88 --> 3589.34]  have taken legal action
[3589.34 --> 3590.54]  against the alt-right,
[3590.72 --> 3592.50]  serving cease and desist orders
[3592.50 --> 3594.20]  to several alt-right personalities
[3594.20 --> 3595.20]  and websites,
[3595.36 --> 3596.60]  including Richard Spencer
[3596.60 --> 3597.88]  and Mike Cernovich.
[3598.88 --> 3599.84]  So, Spencer,
[3600.24 --> 3601.68]  Pepe is all over his site
[3601.68 --> 3603.30]  and the mascot for his podcast,
[3603.48 --> 3604.22]  Alt-Right Politics.
[3604.92 --> 3605.74]  And for Cernovich,
[3606.14 --> 3607.86]  he used a 3D version of Pepe
[3607.86 --> 3609.06]  dancing with Hillary Clinton,
[3609.18 --> 3610.08]  reading aloud sections
[3610.08 --> 3611.44]  of her new book.
[3611.44 --> 3613.66]  He's also served a cease and desist
[3613.66 --> 3615.60]  against r slash the Donald.
[3616.14 --> 3617.40]  And as someone who has tried
[3617.40 --> 3618.20]  to contact Reddit
[3618.20 --> 3619.56]  about the content on their site
[3619.56 --> 3620.30]  before,
[3620.64 --> 3622.68]  I can say that's probably
[3622.68 --> 3623.36]  not going anywhere.
[3623.76 --> 3624.74]  They're really, really good
[3624.74 --> 3625.76]  at just ignoring people.
[3625.76 --> 3626.64]  They've also issued
[3626.64 --> 3628.40]  DMCA takedown requests
[3628.40 --> 3628.94]  to Reddit,
[3629.08 --> 3629.36]  Amazon,
[3629.54 --> 3629.80]  YouTube,
[3629.94 --> 3630.56]  and Twitter,
[3630.96 --> 3631.90]  notifying them
[3631.90 --> 3633.20]  that use of Pepe
[3633.20 --> 3634.04]  by the alt-right
[3634.04 --> 3635.12]  on their platforms
[3635.12 --> 3636.80]  is copyright infringement.
[3636.80 --> 3638.82]  And at the end of August,
[3639.04 --> 3639.66]  Fury's lawyers
[3639.66 --> 3641.18]  actually reached a settlement
[3641.18 --> 3642.04]  with Eric Hauser
[3642.04 --> 3643.62]  who appropriated Pepe's image
[3643.62 --> 3644.02]  for use
[3644.02 --> 3644.98]  in an Islamophobic
[3644.98 --> 3645.80]  children's book.
[3646.24 --> 3647.34]  So they forced him
[3647.34 --> 3648.40]  to stop selling the book
[3648.40 --> 3649.82]  and made him donate
[3649.82 --> 3650.38]  the profits
[3650.38 --> 3651.04]  to the Council
[3651.04 --> 3652.46]  on American-Islamic Relations.
[3652.86 --> 3653.26]  Apparently,
[3653.44 --> 3653.92]  Google Play
[3653.92 --> 3654.90]  has stopped selling
[3654.90 --> 3655.84]  Build the Wall
[3655.84 --> 3656.58]  the game
[3656.58 --> 3659.84]  because of advertising
[3659.84 --> 3661.46]  with special guest appearances
[3661.46 --> 3662.02]  from Pepe.
[3662.08 --> 3662.70]  That's why they've
[3662.70 --> 3663.32]  stopped selling it.
[3664.88 --> 3665.36]  Previously,
[3665.56 --> 3666.32]  Apple had refused
[3666.32 --> 3667.42]  to publish the game
[3667.42 --> 3668.24]  until it removed
[3668.24 --> 3668.96]  Pepe the Frog.
[3669.32 --> 3670.96]  And Apple has a blanket ban
[3670.96 --> 3672.02]  against Pepe the Frog
[3672.02 --> 3672.98]  that it has enforced
[3672.98 --> 3674.34]  against multiple app creators.
[3674.56 --> 3675.94]  This is fascinating
[3675.94 --> 3676.98]  because it kind of
[3676.98 --> 3677.96]  opens up a conversation
[3677.96 --> 3679.96]  about who owns memes.
[3680.32 --> 3680.72]  Yes.
[3681.30 --> 3681.56]  Like,
[3681.80 --> 3682.90]  memes have kind of existed
[3682.90 --> 3684.08]  as a sort of like
[3684.08 --> 3686.52]  distributed content
[3686.52 --> 3688.10]  that kind of arose
[3688.10 --> 3688.90]  from the internet
[3688.90 --> 3690.22]  sort of organically.
[3690.54 --> 3691.26]  So it's like,
[3691.28 --> 3692.24]  if you make a meme
[3692.24 --> 3693.18]  and it becomes a meme,
[3693.28 --> 3694.48]  do you own the copyright?
[3694.48 --> 3694.66]  Right?
[3695.02 --> 3696.32]  And the answer
[3696.32 --> 3697.50]  until now,
[3697.62 --> 3698.08]  though I don't,
[3698.22 --> 3698.84]  to my knowledge,
[3698.94 --> 3699.82]  this hasn't been
[3699.82 --> 3701.46]  like seriously,
[3701.70 --> 3702.32]  legally defined.
[3702.32 --> 3702.44]  I don't really think
[3702.44 --> 3702.96]  it's a question.
[3703.06 --> 3704.20]  I think you absolutely do.
[3704.40 --> 3704.62]  Right.
[3704.74 --> 3705.64]  Because you created something.
[3705.86 --> 3706.02]  But,
[3706.02 --> 3708.04]  a lot of the time
[3708.04 --> 3708.62]  it's derivative,
[3709.10 --> 3710.16]  but not derivative
[3710.16 --> 3710.90]  enough.
[3711.46 --> 3712.56]  You didn't create anything.
[3712.68 --> 3713.36]  You captioned it
[3713.36 --> 3714.12]  in a lot of cases.
[3714.12 --> 3714.50]  Right.
[3714.94 --> 3715.56]  And the caption
[3715.56 --> 3716.20]  is often part
[3716.20 --> 3717.12]  of the original creation.
[3717.12 --> 3717.68]  And,
[3717.80 --> 3719.14]  and it has never
[3719.14 --> 3720.80]  been enforced
[3720.80 --> 3723.18]  to this kind of a degree.
[3723.28 --> 3723.42]  Now,
[3723.58 --> 3724.54]  to be clear,
[3725.50 --> 3726.86]  it looks like Matt Fury
[3726.86 --> 3728.18]  is only going after
[3728.18 --> 3728.98]  the alt-right here.
[3729.22 --> 3730.70]  But if he wins
[3730.70 --> 3732.46]  a bunch of these battles,
[3732.66 --> 3734.02]  if he wins a battle
[3734.02 --> 3734.94]  against Reddit,
[3735.06 --> 3736.38]  imagine he wins
[3736.38 --> 3737.34]  against Reddit.
[3737.70 --> 3738.12]  There's some,
[3738.16 --> 3738.90]  there's some problems though.
[3738.96 --> 3740.00]  If he only goes after
[3740.00 --> 3740.48]  the alt-right,
[3740.66 --> 3741.32]  that would mean
[3741.32 --> 3741.92]  that he's doing it
[3741.92 --> 3742.80]  because he doesn't like
[3742.80 --> 3743.96]  how very specific people
[3743.96 --> 3744.70]  are using it.
[3744.82 --> 3745.10]  Exactly.
[3745.10 --> 3745.76]  I don't think that's a way
[3745.76 --> 3746.58]  that you can defend it.
[3746.86 --> 3747.20]  Also,
[3747.38 --> 3748.18]  he let it happen
[3748.18 --> 3750.12]  for so long.
[3750.20 --> 3750.76]  I think that hurts
[3750.76 --> 3751.30]  his case a lot.
[3751.44 --> 3752.16]  That he probably
[3752.16 --> 3752.76]  won't be able
[3752.76 --> 3753.54]  to defend it anymore
[3753.54 --> 3754.60]  because he seemed
[3754.60 --> 3755.64]  okay with it.
[3755.70 --> 3756.38]  I think we've even
[3756.38 --> 3757.50]  talked on the WAN show
[3757.50 --> 3758.62]  about how at one point
[3758.62 --> 3759.60]  in time he was just like,
[3759.94 --> 3760.50]  Peppy the Frog
[3760.50 --> 3761.60]  is just a thing, man.
[3761.70 --> 3762.14]  And it was like
[3762.14 --> 3763.22]  the most stoned statement
[3763.22 --> 3763.98]  I've ever read.
[3764.00 --> 3764.64]  It's just the frog.
[3764.64 --> 3765.68]  Do you remember that?
[3766.28 --> 3767.20]  I don't remember.
[3767.20 --> 3767.96]  It was quite a while ago,
[3768.04 --> 3769.06]  but it was like a very like,
[3769.14 --> 3770.54]  everyone just gets to coexist
[3770.54 --> 3771.58]  and just Peppy the Frog
[3771.58 --> 3772.28]  is just awesome.
[3772.82 --> 3773.30]  Peppy the Frog
[3773.30 --> 3774.16]  is for everyone.
[3774.38 --> 3775.14]  It's so great.
[3775.14 --> 3775.62]  He's probably taking
[3775.62 --> 3776.66]  a bunch of crap for it.
[3777.16 --> 3778.10]  Very likely.
[3778.46 --> 3779.86]  But it's been so long
[3779.86 --> 3781.24]  and that statement came out.
[3781.32 --> 3782.04]  And if there's a statement
[3782.04 --> 3782.58]  saying, sure,
[3782.66 --> 3783.36]  you can use it,
[3784.08 --> 3785.10]  he's basically screwed.
[3785.34 --> 3786.86]  The obvious parallel here
[3786.86 --> 3788.94]  is to the PewDiePie situation
[3788.94 --> 3791.02]  where the Firewatch developer
[3791.02 --> 3792.74]  goes and does a DMCA
[3792.74 --> 3794.08]  takedown specifically
[3794.08 --> 3795.22]  of PewDiePie's
[3795.22 --> 3795.98]  Firewatch content
[3795.98 --> 3796.74]  because they didn't agree
[3796.74 --> 3797.62]  with how, you know,
[3797.72 --> 3798.54]  with him.
[3798.54 --> 3800.18]  And there's a similar
[3800.18 --> 3801.08]  problem there,
[3801.20 --> 3801.66]  which is probably
[3801.66 --> 3802.40]  why you're bringing this up.
[3802.72 --> 3804.04]  But on Firewatch's website,
[3804.04 --> 3805.26]  there's a specific
[3805.26 --> 3807.20]  yes, you can use this
[3807.20 --> 3808.02]  for streaming
[3808.02 --> 3808.94]  and video creation
[3808.94 --> 3810.30]  and you can monetize it.
[3810.84 --> 3811.58]  And like,
[3811.76 --> 3812.80]  that one's a little bit
[3812.80 --> 3813.32]  more direct.
[3813.44 --> 3814.06]  The Firewatch one
[3814.06 --> 3815.30]  is very clean cut.
[3815.84 --> 3817.22]  I'm not even 100% sure
[3817.22 --> 3818.18]  about the Peppy the Frog one.
[3818.26 --> 3819.12]  It was from a while ago
[3819.12 --> 3819.80]  and I think it was
[3819.80 --> 3820.72]  pretty vague anyways.
[3820.94 --> 3821.10]  Yeah.
[3821.22 --> 3822.46]  But if there's a confirm
[3822.46 --> 3823.30]  that you can use it,
[3823.48 --> 3824.56]  like...
[3824.56 --> 3824.82]  Right.
[3824.96 --> 3826.00]  I mean, to be fair,
[3827.00 --> 3828.24]  is the question
[3828.24 --> 3829.88]  whether he's justified
[3829.88 --> 3830.88]  in doing this?
[3830.88 --> 3832.44]  Because I think he is.
[3832.56 --> 3833.20]  Yeah, I don't think
[3833.20 --> 3833.92]  that's the question.
[3834.36 --> 3834.74]  I think he's...
[3834.74 --> 3835.30]  The question of whether
[3835.30 --> 3836.72]  it's like legally...
[3836.72 --> 3837.44]  Yeah, he's justified...
[3837.44 --> 3837.98]  Whether he'll win.
[3838.00 --> 3838.50]  I'm talking about
[3838.50 --> 3839.42]  whether I think he'll win.
[3839.48 --> 3839.62]  Right.
[3839.86 --> 3840.68]  Whether he's justified
[3840.68 --> 3841.34]  in doing this
[3841.34 --> 3842.84]  is not the debate for sure.
[3843.02 --> 3844.24]  If someone creates
[3844.24 --> 3844.68]  an image,
[3844.76 --> 3845.60]  it belongs to them.
[3845.70 --> 3845.96]  Right.
[3846.16 --> 3847.30]  And people can't use it
[3847.30 --> 3847.96]  without permission.
[3848.52 --> 3850.86]  But what the discussion is
[3850.86 --> 3852.34]  is around the fact
[3852.34 --> 3852.96]  that this has always
[3852.96 --> 3854.14]  been this gray area
[3854.14 --> 3855.68]  and now we're opening up
[3855.68 --> 3856.44]  this can of worms
[3856.44 --> 3856.88]  that goes,
[3857.00 --> 3857.24]  okay,
[3857.24 --> 3858.62]  if people are going
[3858.62 --> 3860.12]  to start defending
[3860.12 --> 3861.24]  their memes,
[3861.80 --> 3863.16]  then are we going
[3863.16 --> 3863.94]  to kill memes?
[3865.02 --> 3865.98]  I don't think we will.
[3865.98 --> 3867.00]  This is how memes die.
[3867.26 --> 3868.24]  Not with a bang.
[3869.12 --> 3870.02]  But with a wind.
[3870.28 --> 3873.50]  But with glorious applause.
[3874.72 --> 3875.90]  I think there will still
[3875.90 --> 3877.28]  definitely be some...
[3877.28 --> 3877.88]  Yeah, yeah.
[3878.00 --> 3879.18]  We've got to fit it in there.
[3879.66 --> 3880.98]  I think there's definitely
[3880.98 --> 3881.54]  still going to be
[3881.54 --> 3883.40]  some freeware memes.
[3884.12 --> 3884.62]  And I bet you
[3884.62 --> 3886.12]  there will be a Reddit community
[3886.12 --> 3888.60]  around anything posted in here.
[3888.68 --> 3889.52]  If it is OC,
[3890.08 --> 3891.28]  has some license,
[3891.48 --> 3893.16]  like the public memeing license
[3893.16 --> 3894.52]  where everyone is allowed
[3894.52 --> 3895.28]  to use it forever.
[3895.74 --> 3896.34]  And then people are going
[3896.34 --> 3897.40]  to start creating memes
[3897.40 --> 3898.10]  out of stuff that comes
[3898.10 --> 3898.54]  out of there.
[3898.64 --> 3899.78]  And then memes will be saved.
[3900.24 --> 3900.74]  I think...
[3900.74 --> 3901.68]  I bet you that will happen.
[3901.82 --> 3903.48]  If this goes through,
[3903.60 --> 3903.86]  I bet...
[3903.86 --> 3904.50]  No, no.
[3904.62 --> 3905.92]  The internet would rally
[3905.92 --> 3906.56]  around memes.
[3906.94 --> 3908.12]  Imgur and Reddit
[3908.12 --> 3909.16]  would get behind memes.
[3909.16 --> 3909.84]  4chan too.
[3910.12 --> 3910.98]  Let's not leave that out.
[3911.02 --> 3912.46]  All these big sites,
[3912.60 --> 3913.10]  they're all going to get
[3913.10 --> 3913.46]  behind memes.
[3913.46 --> 3914.34]  Let's bring back
[3914.34 --> 3915.06]  E-bom's world
[3915.06 --> 3915.52]  while we're at it.
[3915.52 --> 3915.84]  Yeah!
[3916.12 --> 3917.24]  They will get behind it.
[3917.24 --> 3917.58]  They'll save memes too!
[3917.86 --> 3918.46]  Why not?
[3918.68 --> 3920.46]  I mean, for this to be
[3920.46 --> 3921.38]  the death of memes,
[3922.20 --> 3923.76]  it kind of requires
[3923.76 --> 3924.94]  every meme creator
[3924.94 --> 3926.86]  to also do that.
[3927.56 --> 3928.44]  To, yeah,
[3928.56 --> 3929.62]  go after copyright
[3929.62 --> 3930.82]  for their memes, right?
[3930.94 --> 3931.60]  Which I don't think.
[3931.60 --> 3932.26]  Yeah, I don't think
[3932.26 --> 3933.24]  that generally people
[3933.24 --> 3933.82]  are responsible
[3933.82 --> 3934.60]  for creating these
[3934.60 --> 3935.12]  kind of things.
[3935.32 --> 3936.40]  I would be a lot more
[3936.40 --> 3937.58]  hesitant to use them, though.
[3938.22 --> 3938.78]  Use what?
[3938.80 --> 3940.04]  If anyone had won
[3940.04 --> 3941.28]  a legal fight ever.
[3941.80 --> 3942.82]  True, true, true.
[3942.82 --> 3943.00]  Yeah.
[3943.78 --> 3944.58]  As an individual,
[3944.74 --> 3945.74]  I might just YOLO it,
[3945.94 --> 3946.82]  but as a business,
[3947.34 --> 3947.50]  dead.
[3947.50 --> 3948.24]  I think as an individual,
[3948.36 --> 3948.86]  you'd be fine.
[3948.90 --> 3949.68]  But how does fair use
[3949.68 --> 3950.40]  play into that?
[3950.50 --> 3951.24]  Because, like,
[3951.28 --> 3951.98]  if you take a meme
[3951.98 --> 3952.50]  and you're like,
[3952.60 --> 3953.28]  okay, I'm going to make
[3953.28 --> 3953.94]  a copy of this meme
[3953.94 --> 3954.60]  and put your, like,
[3955.00 --> 3956.34]  block text caption on it,
[3956.74 --> 3957.28]  that's not,
[3957.38 --> 3958.12]  I mean, that's technically
[3958.12 --> 3959.38]  parody.
[3959.94 --> 3960.88]  It's technically kind of,
[3960.88 --> 3961.16]  like, tough.
[3961.16 --> 3962.58]  For commercial use,
[3962.64 --> 3963.02]  it's tough.
[3963.22 --> 3963.78]  Yeah, yeah.
[3963.90 --> 3964.88]  Well, if it's commercial use,
[3964.94 --> 3965.54]  I think that's why
[3965.54 --> 3966.44]  these are kind of clear cut.
[3966.44 --> 3967.28]  Especially when
[3967.28 --> 3970.12]  there was the exact same font
[3970.12 --> 3971.70]  usually on the previous one,
[3971.82 --> 3972.74]  I don't think you'd
[3972.74 --> 3973.48]  get away with that.
[3973.56 --> 3974.56]  I think you'd have to
[3974.56 --> 3975.82]  change the core of the image.
[3975.98 --> 3976.08]  Yep.
[3977.48 --> 3978.20]  All right.
[3978.40 --> 3979.70]  So that's pretty much it
[3979.70 --> 3980.84]  for the WAN show for today.
[3980.96 --> 3982.12]  Thank you guys for tuning in.
[3982.20 --> 3983.60]  Big thanks to our special guests,
[3983.74 --> 3986.16]  Justine, Stephen, and Riley.
[3986.56 --> 3987.36]  You can check out,
[3987.58 --> 3988.00]  well, I mean,
[3988.16 --> 3989.80]  you're watching on Twitch right now,
[3989.82 --> 3990.32]  or maybe you're not,
[3990.32 --> 3991.18]  maybe you're watching on YouTube.
[3991.26 --> 3992.02]  If you're watching on YouTube,
[3992.14 --> 3992.96]  we'll have links to
[3992.96 --> 3995.00]  where you can go check those guys out
[3995.00 --> 3995.88]  in the video description.
[3995.88 --> 3996.42]  If you're on Twitch,
[3996.60 --> 3998.16]  Google is a really cool website.
[3998.34 --> 3998.54]  Yeah.
[3998.90 --> 3999.64]  It works quite well.
[3999.66 --> 4000.48]  There's everything on there.
[4000.64 --> 4000.90]  Yeah.
[4001.00 --> 4001.82]  They got everything on Google.
[4001.84 --> 4003.42]  All right, I'm rolling the outro.
[4003.66 --> 4004.30]  I'm rolling the outro.
[4004.80 --> 4005.78]  I mean, they can still hear us.
[4005.82 --> 4006.72]  You guys are killing me here.
[4006.74 --> 4007.46]  They heard you say
[4007.46 --> 4008.20]  I'm rolling the outro.
[4008.30 --> 4009.26]  You guys are killing me.
[4009.36 --> 4010.44]  Way to be subtle, Linus.
[4010.62 --> 4011.36]  You're killing me here.
[4012.08 --> 4012.66]  Are you alive?
[4014.02 --> 4014.88]  You're killing me.
[4014.88 --> 4015.84]  I can still be alive
[4015.84 --> 4016.14]  while you're killing me.
[4016.14 --> 4017.06]  What's taking so long?
[4017.16 --> 4017.82]  Am I dead?
[4018.46 --> 4019.36]  Am I alive?
[4019.36 --> 4021.10]  I do not know.
[4025.60 --> 4026.58]  Oh my God.
[4027.48 --> 4028.30]  How long is this outro?
