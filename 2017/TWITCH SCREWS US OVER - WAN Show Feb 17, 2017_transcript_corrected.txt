[0.00 → 3.36] And here we go.
[4.18 → 4.66] Are we live?
[5.24 → 6.10] Theoretically, yes.
[6.66 → 6.94] Hey.
[9.14 → 9.66] And...
[9.66 → 11.02] Do we need like a Linus Iron logo in the corner?
[11.02 → 11.92] Hold on a second.
[12.10 → 12.38] Hold on.
[12.40 → 13.12] I'm working on it.
[13.32 → 15.38] I'm just getting that centred.
[16.30 → 17.86] Get that cable kind of...
[17.86 → 18.28] Oh, yeah.
[18.38 → 19.22] That's just...
[19.22 → 19.64] I don't...
[19.64 → 21.76] I'm happy everything works, but this doesn't look great.
[21.76 → 22.60] Yeah, I know.
[22.74 → 23.22] I know.
[23.32 → 24.22] We're working on it.
[24.28 → 24.56] Okay.
[25.38 → 27.22] So it's official.
[27.22 → 36.68] Well, pretty much everything about the WAN show setup here has been overhauled at this point.
[36.78 → 40.22] There are still a couple of things that we could do to improve it.
[40.26 → 46.30] In fact, I have a bunch of them listed out in my WAN show improvement ideas list here.
[46.42 → 46.78] Oh, wow.
[48.58 → 49.28] Hold on.
[49.34 → 49.82] Hold on.
[50.14 → 50.86] Where'd it go?
[51.00 → 52.28] Oh, maybe I deleted it.
[52.30 → 53.28] This is a long list.
[53.46 → 53.86] No, no, no.
[53.90 → 54.86] Not all of it is list.
[54.86 → 56.52] In fact, maybe none of it is list.
[57.22 → 57.50] Yeah.
[58.70 → 59.42] Here we go.
[59.58 → 61.10] We could put padding on the table.
[61.76 → 62.08] Okay.
[62.12 → 64.48] So we wouldn't get as much audio reflection off the table.
[64.76 → 64.86] Yeah.
[64.86 → 66.52] We could put clouds above the set.
[66.62 → 66.88] Yep.
[67.00 → 68.34] Like dampening clouds.
[69.98 → 76.02] We could have rolling sheets of acoustic batting kind of around the camera on the other side.
[76.16 → 78.00] He means like on wheels so we can push them around.
[78.14 → 78.32] Yeah.
[78.56 → 78.72] Yeah.
[79.16 → 80.56] Not like rolling thunder.
[80.70 → 80.88] Yeah.
[80.88 → 81.88] You know, like...
[83.16 → 87.16] That's the best thunder impression I could do.
[87.22 → 91.82] That was great.
[91.82 → 92.88] That was great.
[92.88 → 95.62] Actually, everything else here that's on my list we have already done.
[95.94 → 96.30] What?
[96.38 → 97.74] Thunder goes whoop, whoop, whoop.
[97.74 → 98.08] Yes.
[101.18 → 102.52] Like dubstep thunder.
[102.52 → 103.52] Look, I don't...
[103.52 → 109.52] I don't make the rules about how thunder gets impersonated or impressioned.
[111.52 → 112.36] Either way.
[113.08 → 115.80] So people are already asking about the KC Iron thing.
[116.24 → 116.54] Oh.
[117.24 → 117.62] Okay.
[117.74 → 122.84] Well, that's a perfect, absolutely perfect first topic for the WAN show today.
[122.90 → 123.14] Yeah.
[123.14 → 125.52] So we should probably explain like what was happening for the archive viewers.
[125.52 → 126.18] Hold on a second.
[126.50 → 128.28] Is that even one of our...
[128.28 → 128.52] No.
[128.72 → 130.78] How do I even spell K-A-Y?
[130.96 → 131.10] Yeah.
[131.16 → 131.28] Okay.
[131.28 → 132.56] That's not one of our topics for the week.
[132.64 → 133.60] So we don't have a source for this.
[134.14 → 136.14] But before the WAN show started...
[136.14 → 137.10] They didn't do anything wrong.
[137.24 → 137.44] No, no.
[137.50 → 137.68] I mean...
[137.68 → 137.92] Yeah, yeah.
[137.92 → 138.14] No, no.
[138.18 → 138.62] It's not...
[138.62 → 138.72] Yeah.
[138.72 → 141.58] It's just our doc preparation team.
[141.78 → 143.10] Wouldn't have known anything about this.
[143.94 → 149.76] So before the show started, our channel was hosting KC Iron.
[149.90 → 150.12] Yeah.
[150.32 → 151.22] For some reason.
[151.42 → 155.46] Maybe you could explain why our channel would have been hosting KC Iron.
[155.56 → 158.46] So I noticed this with my...
[158.46 → 162.04] Anyway, Twitch is doing this thing where there's auto hosting.
[162.30 → 164.28] You can have it so that when you're not streaming...
[164.28 → 169.64] We should explain for people who only really watch WAN show on Twitch what exactly hosting means first.
[169.70 → 169.90] Yeah, no.
[169.94 → 170.48] I'm getting into that.
[170.48 → 171.00] Oh, okay.
[171.20 → 172.04] So auto hosting.
[172.14 → 175.76] The idea of auto hosting is that it will automatically host other channels.
[175.94 → 182.62] Hosting is where it will show the video feed of another channel on your channel when you are offline.
[182.62 → 191.52] So the idea behind it is that if you were like super bros with someone, then you could set your channel to host their channel.
[191.52 → 196.16] So that when you're not streaming, they get additional viewers who happen to be on your channel.
[196.26 → 199.76] It can make a lot of sense, especially for groups like Nerd Fusion.
[200.30 → 204.78] If one of the guys at Nerd Fusion is not currently streaming, they can host another one of their buddies.
[204.96 → 207.62] They're all a big team that are trying to help each other grow.
[207.76 → 209.48] That is very good for that.
[209.54 → 212.28] People like Kyle and Paul can host each other.
[212.38 → 213.50] That makes tons of sense.
[213.62 → 215.42] They collab all the freaking time.
[215.42 → 222.38] People that want to help each other can do that, or your channel could do that just to try to keep your audience engaged.
[222.50 → 226.50] If you have people that stream in very similar styles to you, that's kind of what it's supposed to be for.
[226.90 → 236.76] And auto hosting is a way to handle all of that and do all of that without you having to go into your chat and going slash host space channel name.
[236.76 → 242.84] You can just set up a group of people that you want to auto host, and we'll do that just automatically.
[243.46 → 249.86] Now, Twitch changed something where it went into originally all of these settings were off by default.
[250.00 → 252.64] And you had to like you had to manually host things.
[252.96 → 253.60] It was an opt-in.
[253.66 → 254.60] You had to manually host things.
[254.72 → 258.92] Then when they came up with auto hosting, you had to go put in the channels that you wanted to auto host.
[258.92 → 261.92] And then Twitch was just like, well, we want this to happen because.
[262.44 → 269.70] I just want to jump in and like, I don't know, a tenth of the messages in chat are people setting up auto hosting for us.
[270.36 → 270.56] Nice.
[270.60 → 271.34] So you guys are cool.
[271.42 → 271.88] You guys are bros.
[271.88 → 272.12] Hell yeah.
[272.12 → 272.52] Carry on.
[273.28 → 276.48] So and like it's actually really cool, the idea of auto hosting.
[276.88 → 277.06] Yeah.
[277.38 → 280.62] But when like you set it up, it's really cool.
[280.62 → 291.34] For like your friends who might have content styles that you consider to be, you know, appropriate and like similar related and cool for your audience.
[291.54 → 291.64] Yeah.
[291.64 → 297.58] I mean, for example, our channel is not flagged as a mature audience only channel.
[298.08 → 298.56] Yeah.
[298.72 → 301.18] So we probably shouldn't host ones that are mature audiences only.
[301.66 → 308.86] And like so are what Twitch did is they made it so that everyone was auto hosting random pools of people.
[308.86 → 313.68] So our channel was auto hosting Casey Iron right before the show.
[313.88 → 316.28] Everyone showed up because WAN shows supposed to happen.
[316.42 → 318.52] We're late as per usual, but not like way too late.
[318.52 → 319.90] Hey, we were not that late.
[320.20 → 320.80] We were late.
[320.96 → 323.36] We were like seven minutes late, which is actually.
[323.66 → 324.84] A lot better than normal.
[325.00 → 325.34] Yes.
[325.62 → 325.98] Yes.
[326.14 → 326.80] Thank you.
[326.86 → 327.72] But we were still a little late.
[327.84 → 329.92] So and people often show up early either way.
[330.02 → 334.10] So people are here waiting for WAN and then Casey Iron's there, and it's like, what's going on?
[334.10 → 339.14] And then she went on the forum and then apparently she confused RAM and CPU or something.
[339.24 → 339.54] I don't know.
[339.62 → 341.06] I read something about that in the chat.
[341.18 → 342.46] I don't want to directly quote that.
[342.60 → 342.72] I don't.
[342.80 → 343.78] I didn't listen to it.
[343.84 → 344.36] I didn't see it.
[344.40 → 344.90] I didn't hear it.
[345.86 → 346.48] So, yeah.
[346.74 → 348.88] Anyway, our auto hosting has been turned off.
[348.98 → 349.56] Yes, sir.
[349.84 → 350.56] And ma'am.
[352.12 → 353.32] And everything in between.
[353.54 → 353.78] Yep.
[354.30 → 355.46] And let's roll the intro.
[355.66 → 356.28] We're moving on.
[356.28 → 378.24] Book.
[378.78 → 379.70] I picked this.
[381.24 → 381.76] Book.
[381.96 → 382.56] I picked this.
[382.98 → 383.46] Really?
[383.84 → 384.16] Yeah.
[384.62 → 385.12] Oh.
[385.34 → 385.58] Yeah.
[386.28 → 387.06] Oh, well, that's cool.
[387.18 → 387.40] Yeah.
[388.18 → 389.30] When did that happen?
[390.06 → 390.32] What?
[390.46 → 390.78] Today.
[391.60 → 392.18] Well, okay.
[392.18 → 392.96] Like a business deal?
[393.24 → 393.64] Yeah.
[393.84 → 394.46] I don't know.
[395.04 → 395.76] I have no idea.
[395.86 → 398.28] But they're one of the sponsors of the WAN show today?
[398.38 → 398.58] Yeah.
[400.08 → 400.48] Oh.
[400.66 → 401.48] Like actually, yeah.
[401.52 → 402.26] That wasn't a mistake.
[402.38 → 402.64] Cool.
[402.74 → 403.08] Okay.
[403.50 → 404.94] So, you know what?
[405.22 → 407.60] I guess probably the best thing for us to do right now.
[407.60 → 415.30] We're going to have a full like upgrade vlog style video of all the improvements, most of which you can't see right now.
[415.30 → 418.16] The whole chat is like, oh my God, intro had sound.
[420.62 → 424.92] But we have made a lot of improvements to the WAN show.
[425.12 → 427.62] I'm just going to show you guys some of the stuff we've done.
[427.68 → 429.02] So check out the desk now.
[429.56 → 432.50] It's like, okay, it doesn't look that tidy.
[432.50 → 433.82] But trust me.
[433.82 → 434.62] It's a lot tidier than it used to be.
[434.62 → 435.08] Trust me.
[435.14 → 436.28] It's like pretty tidy.
[436.52 → 436.68] Yeah.
[436.72 → 442.58] Like this is just our laptop power adapters that are going into this power splitter here.
[442.58 → 452.08] So it's actually completely tidy other than like Luke's laptop, the HDMI cables that we each have because we can both screen share now.
[452.08 → 455.78] The 10 keyless keyboard that Corsair hooked us up with.
[455.86 → 460.22] So I have a little bit more space for the keyboard, mouse, and laptop here.
[461.10 → 469.62] Also, you might notice none of the audio gear is there because it has all moved to the badass.
[470.20 → 470.94] Go around the monitor.
[471.08 → 471.44] Yeah.
[471.64 → 471.92] Hold on.
[471.96 → 472.44] I got this.
[472.44 → 476.32] It has all moved to the badass retro server cabinet.
[477.16 → 480.60] So none of this would have happened.
[480.70 → 481.72] Oh, I forgot.
[481.88 → 483.74] I forgot like the most important piece.
[484.24 → 485.26] The WAN show PC.
[487.34 → 489.56] We made it great again.
[490.12 → 493.32] How RGB is that, my friends?
[493.96 → 497.66] How RGB on a scale of one to RGB?
[498.16 → 498.68] Well, six.
[498.86 → 500.10] Is the WAN show PC.
[500.10 → 501.42] There's six RGB fans.
[501.42 → 502.66] There are six RGB fans.
[502.74 → 503.40] Thank you for that, Luke.
[503.46 → 507.74] But I also have an RGB mouse and RGB keyboard hooked up to it.
[507.86 → 508.58] Is that RGB keyboard?
[508.92 → 510.22] Yeah, it's an RGB keyboard.
[510.36 → 511.06] It looks like a red.
[511.24 → 512.62] I just don't have it configured right now.
[512.68 → 515.30] But it's definitely RGB in its heart.
[515.52 → 515.86] Okay.
[516.10 → 516.62] In its heart.
[516.84 → 518.62] That's all they ask.
[519.78 → 528.42] So none of that would have happened without Corsair hooking us up, without Focus rite hooking us up with all the new audio gear,
[528.84 → 530.78] without Epiphany hooking us up with.
[530.78 → 531.72] So you check this out.
[532.18 → 534.64] You don't have anything incriminating on your screen, do you?
[534.78 → 535.28] Okay, cool.
[535.72 → 537.24] So we can do Linus' screen.
[537.56 → 538.92] We can do Luke's screen.
[539.12 → 539.60] Boom.
[540.06 → 542.44] Also, you're in extend mode right now anyway.
[542.68 → 544.96] So, yep.
[545.54 → 546.24] You sure are.
[546.36 → 547.08] I just ruined it.
[547.16 → 548.80] You went to PC only.
[549.32 → 549.64] Okay.
[549.88 → 550.42] I fixed it.
[550.62 → 551.54] Luke's a little new.
[551.60 → 552.80] He's a little new at this.
[552.90 → 553.08] Okay.
[553.08 → 554.40] He's still learning.
[556.32 → 557.72] So we got all that stuff.
[557.82 → 560.68] We've got a better Sancho streaming PC than ever before.
[560.80 → 562.40] It's got 64 gigs of RAM now.
[562.40 → 562.70] Oh, dang.
[562.70 → 563.68] Six core processor.
[563.88 → 564.22] There we go.
[564.58 → 566.32] NVMe SSD boot drive.
[566.32 → 567.86] It's like dank AF.
[568.04 → 568.34] Cool.
[568.56 → 569.38] Super dank.
[569.48 → 571.32] I saw like, I don't know if they can see.
[571.48 → 572.78] There's like the old Sancho.
[572.80 → 573.40] No, they can't see.
[573.42 → 574.40] No, they can't see anymore.
[574.48 → 579.58] It's the old Sancho PC with like the RAM and heat sink just strewn on top of it,
[579.66 → 580.32] hanging out in the back.
[580.32 → 581.02] They're just chilling.
[581.26 → 582.42] They're just chilling over there.
[582.52 → 582.68] See?
[582.80 → 583.32] There they are.
[583.86 → 584.42] Bye-bye.
[584.74 → 585.16] Bye-bye.
[585.30 → 585.62] Peace.
[586.00 → 587.68] Peace, old Sancho PC.
[588.42 → 588.82] Later.
[589.16 → 589.90] Rest in pieces.
[590.62 → 591.60] All of that, you know.
[591.88 → 592.60] Yeah, so.
[592.72 → 594.18] So I'm super stoked.
[594.46 → 595.12] We've moved on.
[595.38 → 600.52] We have, I believe, and I don't want to jinx it, but other than our hideous table,
[601.26 → 605.46] we have completely moved on to the point where we shouldn't have any issues anymore.
[605.64 → 605.78] Yeah.
[605.78 → 607.62] Should we tell the story of the table?
[608.58 → 608.88] Sure.
[609.12 → 610.36] Why we have such an ugly table?
[610.42 → 612.10] Brandon wanted me to change the table.
[613.68 → 617.30] Do you support Brandon's initiative to change the table?
[617.44 → 618.14] I don't think so.
[618.72 → 619.90] I like keeping the table.
[619.90 → 625.14] So who was the first person to work at Linus Media Group and use this table?
[625.34 → 625.50] Me.
[626.08 → 633.04] And why are there, like, acid-etched marks through the paint?
[633.22 → 634.04] You might have to show them.
[634.04 → 635.58] Okay, okay, we're bringing back the webcam.
[635.86 → 636.04] Yeah.
[636.14 → 639.56] Also, we have a webcam now that's going to always be here,
[639.60 → 642.86] just as, like, a way for us to just show random stuff.
[642.96 → 645.90] I mean, obviously, it's not, like, colour-corrected or anything.
[645.90 → 650.62] But do you see the entire, like, edge of the table here?
[651.06 → 651.62] It's like...
[651.62 → 655.30] And you can see, like, the main bad spots, like here and over there.
[655.52 → 655.78] Yeah.
[655.96 → 656.20] Yeah.
[656.34 → 658.78] So that's all burning from, like, my wrists.
[661.58 → 662.64] From working so long.
[662.64 → 666.08] This is the table that the original Titan videos all came out of.
[666.16 → 666.42] That's right.
[666.42 → 671.02] Which is, like, one of the most ridiculous pieces of work I've, like, literally ever done.
[671.10 → 671.38] Yep.
[671.76 → 673.00] Good old original Titan.
[674.14 → 674.54] Yeah.
[674.62 → 676.36] This was my desk for a very long time.
[676.72 → 678.34] And the paint's, like, thin, and it's...
[678.34 → 679.46] Isn't it an Ikea desk?
[679.46 → 682.74] So the story goes even further back.
[683.08 → 683.26] The origin story I don't know as well.
[683.26 → 691.72] The origin story was that we were starting up Linus Media Group, and we had no money.
[691.92 → 692.08] Yeah.
[692.12 → 698.64] Like, for us, budgeting for a gallon of paint to paint the walls in the garage was, like,
[699.24 → 702.48] a significant line item in our startup costs.
[702.68 → 702.84] Yeah.
[702.84 → 710.80] So one of my old coworkers at NCI, his aunt or something, was getting rid of some Ikea
[710.80 → 711.26] furniture.
[711.50 → 714.30] And I kind of went, ugh, Ikea furniture has kind of that stigma.
[714.76 → 717.46] And then he's like, no, no, it's old Ikea furniture.
[717.62 → 718.42] It's the good stuff.
[718.62 → 721.36] So this thing is, like, bomb build.
[721.52 → 721.62] Yeah.
[721.66 → 727.70] Like, it has a metal frame under the incredibly heavy tabletop.
[727.70 → 733.52] Like, it's still some kind of composite, but it's not, like, have you guys ever cut
[733.52 → 733.96] apart an Ikea desk?
[733.96 → 735.04] It's not, like, cardboard filled.
[735.32 → 735.50] Yeah.
[735.60 → 735.82] Yeah.
[736.12 → 738.66] They have, like, corrugated cardboard inside them.
[738.70 → 738.88] Yeah.
[738.98 → 740.04] I mean, they're light.
[740.26 → 740.48] Yeah.
[740.52 → 741.96] And they're actually very strong.
[742.30 → 746.74] And this is not an Ikea sales pitch, but, like, it's a pretty cool technology.
[747.42 → 749.16] You know, we save materials and all that.
[749.46 → 750.00] But, like...
[750.00 → 751.42] They light up like crazy.
[751.78 → 754.74] They weren't built, like, they're not built like this thing was.
[754.80 → 755.82] They're not good for fire resistance.
[755.82 → 760.38] So what we did was I got, again, it was a significant investment at the time, but I
[760.38 → 766.74] got a spray bomb of, like, kind of textured speckled paint with the idea being that this
[766.74 → 770.94] table can pull double duty because it was, oh, it was incredibly ugly when we got it.
[770.96 → 773.60] I think this beige colour is the actual tabletop colour.
[773.80 → 774.58] It was, like, an off-white.
[774.66 → 775.08] It was awful.
[775.46 → 777.52] So I was like, this table can pull double duty.
[778.00 → 780.86] We'll run our benchmarks with the test benches on it.
[780.86 → 787.36] And then we can also use this cool texture with this fancy paint I spent an extra $3 on to
[787.36 → 789.72] do, like, B-roll glam footage on it.
[792.66 → 795.08] So now we've obviously moved on from that.
[795.16 → 797.70] But the table still holds a special place in my heart.
[797.76 → 801.40] It's one of the first things Linus Media Group ever owned.
[802.50 → 804.16] And we didn't pay for it.
[804.20 → 804.52] It was free.
[804.64 → 805.70] Did I mention that part?
[805.80 → 807.14] They were giving them away for free.
[807.14 → 809.42] So that's the story of the table.
[809.42 → 809.94] Sort of epic.
[810.10 → 811.22] And we don't need a replacement.
[811.68 → 812.22] That's right.
[812.42 → 812.64] Yeah.
[812.80 → 813.26] That's right.
[813.36 → 813.74] It's fine.
[813.78 → 816.76] This table is a reminder of where we come from.
[816.92 → 817.00] Yeah.
[817.08 → 817.46] That's right.
[818.14 → 818.54] So.
[819.06 → 819.14] No.
[820.14 → 820.50] Nope.
[820.70 → 821.64] No, Brandon.
[823.64 → 824.70] Bad Brandon.
[827.08 → 827.80] All right.
[828.08 → 831.84] Speaking of, out with the old, in with the new.
[831.84 → 834.78] So the original source here is WCCF Tech.
[834.78 → 842.14] And they claim, according to the headline here, AMD Ryzen lineup and prices confirmed.
[842.30 → 846.38] Eight cores for as low as $320.
[847.26 → 855.62] Putting Ry zen right competitive with twice as many cores and overclocking capability with a four,
[855.76 → 858.98] excuse me, we're up to 7,700K.
[858.98 → 861.98] Hey, sorry, I forgot there was a difference.
[862.30 → 864.62] Oh, right.
[865.04 → 865.88] Oh, okay.
[866.48 → 870.68] There was, there was a thing that, not to jump too far, but I think this might actually be an upcoming topic,
[870.82 → 872.14] but we'll get more into it a little bit later.
[872.22 → 872.38] Yeah.
[872.50 → 877.52] There was Intel saying that there's going to be a 15% performance bump on the 8,000 series chips.
[877.52 → 881.34] And a lot of people were brought up a graphic that shows like, yeah.
[881.42 → 884.36] And you said there's a 15% performance bump last time too.
[885.48 → 889.52] So anyway, that was awkward.
[889.70 → 891.00] I mean, what is a bump?
[891.00 → 894.28] Well, okay.
[894.32 → 895.82] It was in one specific benchmark.
[896.34 → 896.72] Yeah.
[896.72 → 899.22] And I think it was like more for their mobile chips or something.
[899.22 → 899.52] Oh, no.
[899.60 → 901.34] Was it like a video transcoding one?
[901.42 → 903.34] Is the onboard GPU better than ever?
[903.86 → 904.50] Seamark, I think.
[904.72 → 905.12] Okay.
[905.32 → 906.12] Seamark is like.
[906.12 → 906.88] I can try to find it.
[906.88 → 912.66] Is broad enough that it's kind of hard to tell how well it would represent the improvements.
[913.10 → 913.30] Yeah.
[913.40 → 914.64] Did you see me slip that in there?
[914.64 → 915.04] I did.
[915.34 → 915.48] Yeah.
[915.48 → 917.78] So much shade.
[917.90 → 927.32] Anyway, so the entire Ry zen CPU lineup has been verified and pricing confirmed through various online retailers.
[927.88 → 932.96] At least three different CPUs are supposed to be available on day one.
[932.96 → 945.20] And I got to say, if I hated the name Ry zen before, the amount of hate that I have for the model numbers that go with it is an entire order of magnitude higher.
[945.48 → 960.50] So they will include the Ry zen 7 1800X, the Ry zen 7 1700X, and the Ry zen 7 1700.
[963.08 → 964.28] So R7.
[965.54 → 968.42] It's like I actually have a video.
[968.42 → 972.40] Hold on.
[972.50 → 974.70] I'm going to see if I can see if this comes out.
[974.70 → 976.38] You should make a video just called How to Name Your Product.
[977.42 → 979.40] That's actually not a terrible idea.
[980.14 → 984.96] Not that many people would watch it, but hopefully they would be important people like Minlang10.
[986.04 → 988.20] And oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[988.24 → 989.74] Shaw, wide open internet, whatever.
[990.12 → 990.54] Thank you.
[990.54 → 997.94] I was playing games with my brother and a friend of ours the other day, and they were both on Shaw, and their internet connection completely cut out multiple times while we were playing.
[998.02 → 1004.44] And it was funny because you knew it was Shaw because we'd be playing, and then all of a sudden just book, both of them are just completely gone at the exact same time.
[1004.66 → 1004.98] Okay.
[1005.14 → 1005.50] It was great.
[1005.50 → 1014.54] So this video is all the evidence that I need to back up that confusing naming schemes.
[1014.54 → 1015.74] Wow, that's so many more views than I thought.
[1016.44 → 1023.04] Confusing naming schemes are a big load of bollocks that need to be gotten rid of.
[1023.20 → 1027.78] Nobody knows what a Core i3, i5, or i7 is.
[1028.20 → 1030.48] 5.6 million people.
[1030.48 → 1030.72] Seven.
[1030.92 → 1032.54] You could get away with saying seven.
[1032.54 → 1033.34] I could say seven.
[1033.50 → 1033.64] Yeah.
[1033.64 → 1042.10] 5.7 million people had to watch this video to understand what the heck is a Core i7.
[1042.32 → 1045.56] And like apparently they needed it because the like and dislike ratio is like really strong.
[1045.64 → 1058.10] It has 92,000 likes with many of the comments being about how annoying my voice is, how I'm probably gay, and what's one of the other really common ones?
[1058.10 → 1062.16] Oh, and how my earrings need to die in a fire because any videos.
[1062.28 → 1063.08] So all unrelated.
[1063.08 → 1064.04] That I host.
[1064.40 → 1066.14] That get big enough to get out of the circle.
[1066.26 → 1066.44] Yeah.
[1066.62 → 1069.34] Get out of the like sort of people who kind of get it.
[1070.72 → 1075.10] So other than those comments, a lot of it is like, wow, thank you for this video.
[1075.30 → 1076.38] I had no idea.
[1076.72 → 1078.88] This was a very confusing thing for me.
[1079.68 → 1082.48] AMD is making this even worse.
[1082.48 → 1083.48] What does seven mean?
[1083.48 → 1084.58] What does seven mean?
[1085.44 → 1096.46] Especially because most of the leaked product lineup references that we've seen so far indicate that everything in the initial lineup will be seven.
[1096.46 → 1096.86] Yeah.
[1096.86 → 1096.90] Yeah.
[1096.90 → 1104.34] I sort of hope that they come up with R5s and R3s just to like be totally horrible.
[1105.06 → 1105.62] Also.
[1105.96 → 1108.40] Just because I'd want to watch the world burn a little bit.
[1108.40 → 1112.86] I mean, you already have four numbers.
[1113.46 → 1114.12] Yeah.
[1114.12 → 1117.16] You have 1,700.
[1118.08 → 1121.22] Maybe that first number could mean something.
[1121.76 → 1123.92] And then the next one could mean something.
[1124.02 → 1126.04] And then the other two could mean something.
[1126.88 → 1136.00] And like, again, and they probably will have some horrible document that's like, what do the product lineup numbers mean?
[1136.00 → 1140.38] So what do the model numbers mean?
[1140.50 → 1140.84] Intel.
[1141.06 → 1142.76] Intel actually has this.
[1143.34 → 1144.06] Here you go.
[1145.58 → 1146.38] Here we go.
[1147.44 → 1154.18] If you need this, you suck at naming products.
[1156.20 → 1156.68] Okay.
[1158.74 → 1162.12] Especially if we're talking about here.
[1162.22 → 1162.98] This is all Leon.
[1163.18 → 1163.74] Really?
[1163.88 → 1164.44] This is all Leon.
[1164.52 → 1165.64] They have an entire page.
[1166.00 → 1166.76] About Leon.
[1167.58 → 1167.86] Okay.
[1168.26 → 1168.54] Whatever.
[1169.28 → 1170.40] There's a consumer one too.
[1170.48 → 1170.94] Here we go.
[1171.54 → 1172.72] It's a separate page.
[1172.82 → 1173.02] Okay.
[1173.20 → 1174.54] I like the thing is it can change.
[1175.20 → 1179.36] If you need this, then you're terrible.
[1180.16 → 1181.50] Like, what is this?
[1181.90 → 1182.54] What is this?
[1182.78 → 1187.20] Why is the product line suffix in a different place than the product line suffix?
[1187.94 → 1190.66] Why is the skew numeric digits moved over here?
[1191.16 → 1191.58] Why?
[1191.90 → 1194.50] What could possibly be a reason for this?
[1194.50 → 1196.26] Did they have a focus group?
[1196.66 → 1202.04] Did they have a focus group where people told them, oh yeah, you know, the way you were doing it before.
[1202.46 → 1203.64] That was really sucky.
[1203.78 → 1205.38] So could you maybe make it more terrible?
[1206.86 → 1208.30] Did the focus group say that?
[1208.36 → 1210.82] Because I think the focus group is full of a bunch of trolls.
[1210.82 → 1215.42] And like I love how they just add stuff in.
[1215.64 → 1217.04] Like that one's a mobile processor.
[1217.24 → 1217.42] Sure.
[1217.56 → 1217.74] Okay.
[1217.82 → 1219.48] Why does it just have letter suffix?
[1219.48 → 1225.04] They don't have more than 26 product lines.
[1225.76 → 1226.36] So why?
[1227.02 → 1227.40] Yeah.
[1227.62 → 1230.44] I mean, what's 26 times 26?
[1230.78 → 1230.98] Okay.
[1231.12 → 1232.98] So 26 times 26.
[1232.98 → 1235.96] I'm trying to get away with having HQ in there because it sounds like high quality.
[1235.96 → 1236.76] What is going in here?
[1236.84 → 1237.26] What is going in?
[1237.38 → 1239.98] They don't have 676 product lines.
[1240.20 → 1241.40] So they don't need two letters.
[1242.20 → 1243.04] That's for sure.
[1243.58 → 1244.50] We know this.
[1245.20 → 1247.16] Also, these are skew specific digits.
[1247.16 → 1248.22] There are three of them.
[1248.32 → 1249.94] So that's 999.
[1250.70 → 1251.06] Okay.
[1251.68 → 1252.50] 999 times.
[1252.56 → 1252.78] Hold on.
[1252.82 → 1254.76] What was 26 times 26 again?
[1256.58 → 1257.18] 676.
[1257.42 → 1257.74] Okay.
[1257.94 → 1260.48] So let's go 676 times.
[1260.64 → 1261.02] What was it?
[1261.10 → 1262.06] 999.
[1262.42 → 1262.76] Okay.
[1262.98 → 1267.62] They don't have 675,324 skews.
[1268.38 → 1269.98] What do they need them all for?
[1270.30 → 1271.22] And that times three.
[1272.16 → 1272.50] Yeah.
[1272.50 → 1276.48] Times I7, I5, I3, Pentium.
[1276.48 → 1276.88] Pentium.
[1276.88 → 1277.58] Oh, yeah.
[1277.58 → 1278.40] Don't forget Pentium.
[1278.60 → 1279.76] And Cameron.
[1279.78 → 1283.88] That's a different modifier, though, because those could be on different things.
[1286.54 → 1292.72] So anyway, I will give Intel and AMD at least this much credit, okay?
[1293.58 → 1298.18] At least they change the product name when they release a new product.
[1298.40 → 1298.60] Yeah.
[1298.72 → 1301.28] The new product might not perform any better.
[1301.28 → 1301.84] At least it's not.
[1301.84 → 1304.50] It might be a rebadge of the old product.
[1304.50 → 1308.86] At least it's not, like, Intel late 2017 i7.
[1311.18 → 1312.84] Because that would be worse.
[1316.46 → 1317.40] Oh, man.
[1317.40 → 1319.90] I mean, at least Intel.
[1320.02 → 1324.30] I was trying to explain this to Yvonne last night, my wife.
[1324.86 → 1329.52] So I was telling her, hey, Luke needs to borrow our Media Centre PC.
[1330.16 → 1334.72] So if you and the kids are watching TV while I'm at badminton tonight, use the NVIDIA Shield.
[1335.00 → 1337.38] And she's like, oh, how do I hook that up?
[1337.40 → 1338.40] I've never done that before.
[1338.76 → 1343.88] And I was like, you just use the Harmony remote and you go play Shield.
[1343.88 → 1344.96] She's like, oh, where is it?
[1344.96 → 1345.82] Is it on your nightstand?
[1346.00 → 1354.40] And I'm like, because NVIDIA released the Shield handheld console called the NVIDIA Shield.
[1355.04 → 1360.34] Then they released the tablet, and they called that the Shield K1 or Shield tablet or something.
[1360.70 → 1365.48] And at the same time, quietly renamed the Shield to the Shield portable.
[1365.74 → 1372.02] Then making matters worse, they released their Shield Android TV, which they then just started calling the NVIDIA Shield.
[1372.02 → 1381.04] So I was talking about the Shield Android TV, and she thought I was talking about the Shield portable because she doesn't care about the Shield Android TV.
[1383.04 → 1385.02] Or just because she got lost in the product naming.
[1385.24 → 1386.02] Yeah, exactly.
[1386.24 → 1387.42] This is what we're talking about.
[1387.72 → 1389.84] Do we have an actual topic to cover today?
[1390.30 → 1391.10] Uh, probably.
[1391.56 → 1391.84] Okay.
[1391.84 → 1392.34] I find this...
[1392.34 → 1392.74] Oh, right.
[1392.88 → 1393.40] The rise in the...
[1393.40 → 1399.48] If the audience agrees with me, I find you ranting about random stuff far more interesting than rumours about a processor that isn't out yet.
[1399.48 → 1400.48] But, you know...
[1400.48 → 1400.64] Okay.
[1400.86 → 1402.88] So back to the processor that isn't out.
[1403.26 → 1410.84] The 1800X is looking like it's going to be in that 6900K sort of competitive price range.
[1410.92 → 1411.62] Wait, how much is this?
[1411.68 → 1413.24] No, 6900K is like double that.
[1413.34 → 1413.58] Cool.
[1414.40 → 1417.06] I've seen them on sale for like considerably less than that as well.
[1417.32 → 1418.12] But you said...
[1418.12 → 1419.44] Wait, 6900K?
[1419.54 → 1419.72] Yeah.
[1419.84 → 1426.46] So this is looking like AMD is going to be in that sort of like the cheaper alternative that like performs better.
[1426.46 → 1429.06] That's all considerably cheaper than 6900K.
[1429.08 → 1429.28] Yeah.
[1429.38 → 1430.54] That's like $1,000, isn't it?
[1431.36 → 1431.60] Yeah.
[1431.68 → 1433.94] So word on the street is like half the price.
[1434.08 → 1440.28] And if AMD can be close to the performance, we are going to be looking at a very, very different playing field.
[1440.48 → 1441.70] Slightly over $1,000.
[1442.12 → 1446.16] So that's slightly more of a discount than half the price.
[1446.16 → 1448.64] 95 watt TDP on this sucker?
[1449.26 → 1457.24] And they're quoting 65 watt on the 1700, which is pricing is anything to go by, looks like it's going to be taking on if they're targeting half the price.
[1457.30 → 1461.24] So that would be going after something like a 68 or a 6700K.
[1461.80 → 1462.32] Whoa.
[1463.54 → 1464.02] Okay.
[1464.20 → 1473.86] As long as boards aren't totally unreasonable, this is going to be one heck of an interesting rest of the year.
[1473.86 → 1474.30] Yeah.
[1475.04 → 1479.70] I'm continuing my skepticism until it is actually in a bench.
[1480.04 → 1481.40] I've been burned far too many times.
[1481.54 → 1490.52] So the WCCF Tech article speculates that the 1700 at 316 US dollars will be 6900K class performance.
[1491.08 → 1491.76] Let's see.
[1491.90 → 1492.00] Wow.
[1492.18 → 1497.28] It's going to come down to overclocking in all likelihood, but let's see how that turns out.
[1497.34 → 1502.72] But for the majority of consumers, the non-overclocking number is going to be what really matters.
[1502.78 → 1503.44] That's true.
[1503.44 → 1504.46] So like...
[1504.46 → 1504.56] Yep.
[1504.76 → 1505.26] That's true.
[1505.28 → 1506.90] I'm very excited for both of those, actually.
[1507.08 → 1509.34] How they both overclock and how they both perform without overclock.
[1509.36 → 1513.72] What I'll say is this, that part of the fun has been taken out of overclocking for me.
[1514.04 → 1514.32] Yes.
[1514.46 → 1516.44] In the last three to four years.
[1516.62 → 1522.84] And the reason for that is that the chips are already clocked at like 4.4 gigahertz in some cases.
[1524.20 → 1526.46] There's not that much headroom left.
[1526.58 → 1529.44] 4.4 Gs is like kind of lot.
[1529.44 → 1533.58] Whereas if AMD comes in and says, okay, you know what?
[1533.58 → 1540.66] We're going to sell them at lower clock speeds, and we're going to bring back some of the fun, some of the silicon lottery.
[1540.66 → 1543.84] Because right now you can expect pretty consistent results.
[1543.84 → 1543.98] Yeah.
[1543.98 → 1548.80] Give or take 300 megahertz on reasonable cooling out of an Intel processor.
[1549.24 → 1552.02] Whereas if AMD goes, okay, yeah, they're going to be cheap.
[1552.62 → 1553.42] We're not going to put...
[1553.42 → 1553.98] We're going to sell them for this much?
[1553.98 → 1554.22] Yeah.
[1554.32 → 1557.26] We're not going to like bin them close to the wire.
[1557.88 → 1561.20] And they're going to overclock like a bat out of hell.
[1561.32 → 1561.88] Have fun.
[1562.72 → 1562.96] Hey.
[1563.14 → 1563.50] Someone might not.
[1563.84 → 1565.12] I might get into it again.
[1565.38 → 1566.00] That could be cool.
[1566.22 → 1566.98] I would love that.
[1567.04 → 1567.98] That would actually be a total blast.
[1567.98 → 1569.40] The overclocking game has been pretty boring.
[1569.64 → 1571.64] Especially with like shots fired.
[1571.78 → 1573.58] But with like NVIDIA cards right now.
[1574.20 → 1574.50] Yeah.
[1574.60 → 1578.34] NVIDIA cards are about as little fun to overclock as anything.
[1578.54 → 1579.34] Holy crap.
[1579.96 → 1580.94] Don't even bother.
[1581.42 → 1582.08] GP boost.
[1582.24 → 1582.74] Thanks, bro.
[1582.74 → 1588.52] I mean, it's nice that we're getting all the performance we can out of a product out of
[1588.52 → 1590.16] the box, which is great.
[1590.64 → 1593.56] But I sure wish that Project Greenlight was...
[1593.56 → 1594.36] Artificial limitations.
[1595.62 → 1596.14] Yeah.
[1596.22 → 1600.50] I sure wish board partners were allowed to just like build crap.
[1600.50 → 1602.06] That Power Edition card.
[1602.62 → 1603.02] Which one?
[1603.06 → 1603.88] That got yanked.
[1603.96 → 1605.82] Remember the 660 Ti Power Edition?
[1605.90 → 1606.64] Yes, I do.
[1606.98 → 1607.14] Yep.
[1608.00 → 1609.54] I still have one of those pre...
[1609.54 → 1610.24] Do you really?
[1610.32 → 1610.82] Pre-nerf?
[1610.90 → 1611.12] Yeah.
[1611.46 → 1611.66] Oh.
[1611.66 → 1612.96] It's still awesome.
[1614.44 → 1615.94] It's still really wicked.
[1617.44 → 1622.56] Anyway, not one to take this kind of thing lying down.
[1622.94 → 1626.76] This was originally posted in the Linus Tech Tips forum by NumLock21.
[1626.76 → 1635.40] Intel is rumoured to be creating higher clocked Kaby Lake CPUs to combat Ry zen.
[1635.90 → 1640.28] I'm going to go out on a limb here and say this won't be enough.
[1641.28 → 1641.94] Hopefully not.
[1641.94 → 1644.86] Oh yeah, I hope it's not enough.
[1644.86 → 1645.14] Yeah.
[1645.14 → 1646.54] For a quad-core.
[1646.54 → 1656.80] So the rumoured SKUs, Overclock3D.net is our source here, are the i5-7640K and i7-7740K.
[1656.80 → 1667.22] And it looks like about a 5% bump here and about a 3% bump here.
[1667.22 → 1668.26] What are those going to cost though?
[1668.26 → 1675.20] Also, it looks like we may get an i5 with hyperthreading, which would be very surprising to me.
[1676.90 → 1681.36] And if Intel introduced these, I suspect...
[1681.36 → 1682.74] Okay.
[1682.74 → 1685.98] I suspect they're going for one of two tactics.
[1686.88 → 1695.82] Either they think that Ry zen's single-threaded performance is not going to be on par with Kaby Lake,
[1696.16 → 1697.94] especially at this kind of clock speed.
[1698.12 → 1702.84] So they might be counting on Ry zen's single-thread performance at the clock speeds it can hit,
[1703.24 → 1707.44] not being able to compete with Kaby Lake at like 4.6 gigahertz.
[1707.44 → 1709.58] And they might be thinking, you know what?
[1710.00 → 1716.04] We can bring these in above the existing chips as gamer-oriented SKUs,
[1716.32 → 1722.22] and these really will deliver the best performance in games, which is possible.
[1723.88 → 1731.52] Or Intel is in full-on panic mode because with how inbred the entire IT industry is,
[1731.52 → 1737.50] I guarantee you there's working Ry zen silicon in Intel's labs right now.
[1737.92 → 1740.70] There's absolutely no way that there isn't.
[1741.16 → 1745.50] So the other possibility is Intel is in panic mode right now,
[1745.64 → 1751.42] and these are going to come straight in as replacements for the 7700 and 7600K,
[1751.62 → 1760.02] and they are getting ready for a significant price adjustment on the LGA 2011 3 platform chips as well.
[1760.02 → 1761.04] I still hope it's not enough.
[1762.08 → 1773.34] So you hope that Intel underestimates Ry zen in spite of the numbers on paper indicating that performance will be very good,
[1773.60 → 1778.70] enough that AMD claws back some market share, prompting someone in Intel to go,
[1779.26 → 1785.30] oh, maybe it would be worthwhile to invest in CPU R&D for single-core performance again.
[1785.30 → 1793.10] I think it would be very healthy if AMD is able to just walk around as king for even a few years.
[1794.12 → 1796.64] I don't think it's going to take a few years for Intel to respond.
[1796.64 → 1797.60] I don't think it is either.
[1797.86 → 1802.72] But that would be awesome because they could really use the revenue for a while
[1802.72 → 1805.50] and getting back into the mainstream conversation.
[1805.50 → 1812.80] Because as much as AMD is talked about by us and as well as the AMD content that we really tried to crush,
[1812.92 → 1818.62] good job at CES, did, market share is super not there.
[1818.84 → 1818.94] Yeah.
[1819.24 → 1826.58] And if we could get closer to 50-50, it's a gamble how much, which person is going to buy what.
[1826.78 → 1828.86] Maybe in the DIY space at least.
[1829.08 → 1829.24] Yeah.
[1829.24 → 1830.50] I don't think –
[1830.50 → 1836.50] Like if we could get new builds and planning on our forum to get closer to 50-50 with these chips out,
[1836.60 → 1837.98] like that would even be really cool.
[1838.22 → 1845.48] I want something to light a fire under Intel because as scary as it is that part of me worries
[1845.48 → 1849.16] that this might be the last time we ever see a big push from AMD.
[1849.32 → 1852.56] I mean it's not like Jim Keller is going to go back and like save them again.
[1853.38 → 1855.14] And he's working at Tesla now.
[1855.14 → 1867.78] So I worry that if this isn't enough to kind of prompt Intel to get their gear into gear –
[1867.78 → 1868.40] Get them –
[1868.40 → 1869.30] Get them into gear?
[1869.36 → 1869.52] Yeah.
[1869.60 → 1870.00] Thank you.
[1870.84 → 1871.66] We got there.
[1872.00 → 1872.38] It's fine.
[1872.68 → 1873.22] We made it.
[1874.28 → 1874.88] Nailed it.
[1874.88 → 1881.68] I worry that we'll just never really – I mean never is a strong word, but I worry that
[1881.68 → 1887.24] we will never really see a fire lit under those guys again.
[1888.80 → 1892.14] So yeah, this feels like our chance.
[1893.28 → 1898.92] On the subject of fires, this was posted by Suicidal Franco on the forum.
[1899.02 → 1901.12] The original article here is from Forbes.
[1901.12 → 1907.92] Oh, thank you for the quote of the day from Richard Branson.
[1909.60 → 1913.56] A fire broke out at a Samsung battery factory.
[1915.00 → 1916.12] Was, was.
[1918.76 → 1920.16] Oh, man.
[1922.52 → 1924.04] Just going to let that sink in for a moment.
[1924.14 → 1925.22] I was just going to say we're just going to sit there for a sec.
[1925.36 → 1925.62] Yeah.
[1925.62 → 1928.74] There isn't even like a ton to say.
[1929.20 → 1934.18] It was a Samsung-affiliated factory in Tianjin, China.
[1934.26 → 1935.02] Hopefully I said that right.
[1935.10 → 1939.06] Caught fire on the morning of February 8th, not even that long ago.
[1939.42 → 1944.96] Pictures circulated on Weibo, a Twitter-like Chinese social media service.
[1945.04 → 1945.80] I've heard of it before.
[1945.88 → 1946.66] I've just only read it.
[1946.90 → 1948.92] Showing black plumes of smoke above the factory.
[1949.36 → 1952.44] The fire didn't affect production, a spokesman has said.
[1952.44 → 1957.02] We don't have a quote in the doc, at least, about whether anyone was injured or died.
[1957.44 → 1958.98] But we do have a quote about production.
[1959.48 → 1959.60] Yeah.
[1959.82 → 1963.78] I'm assuming if production wasn't affected, probably no one was hurt.
[1963.82 → 1964.50] Everyone was fine, yeah.
[1964.50 → 1970.68] Let's hope that that's the only reason that that made it into the statement.
[1970.98 → 1971.22] Yeah.
[1971.22 → 1978.56] But apparently it was caused, so this is actually good news, by discarded faulty batteries.
[1979.68 → 1988.44] So it wasn't caused by like pallets of batteries that were on their way to be shipped to Samsung or anything like that.
[1988.44 → 1990.94] Oh, whew.
[1992.52 → 1998.68] Apparently this factory was within the production scope of Note 7 batteries, so that's kind of funny.
[1999.00 → 1999.82] Oh, man.
[1999.96 → 2002.44] But considering it was discarded batteries, it could be related to that.
[2002.48 → 2003.10] Yep, yep.
[2003.20 → 2004.92] Could absolutely be related to that.
[2004.98 → 2013.60] And speaking of injuries and stuff and potential production losses, there was a different Chinese factory that replaced 90% of their human workers with robots,
[2013.60 → 2017.94] and they saw a 250% increase in production.
[2019.00 → 2019.48] Wow.
[2019.90 → 2026.72] The factory used to be run by 650 employees, and now only 60 of them still work there,
[2026.76 → 2029.94] and most of them are there to ensure that the machines are still in working order.
[2030.04 → 2034.06] So it's probably more like the millwrights and stuff that were working there are still working there.
[2034.88 → 2035.16] Yeah.
[2035.70 → 2036.30] Pretty ridiculous.
[2036.30 → 2042.46] Robotic arms produce certain parts of the mobile phones that are produced at the factory at each station.
[2043.60 → 2044.60] Wow.
[2046.76 → 2051.90] The general manager has said that the number of human employees could drop as little as 20 someday.
[2052.12 → 2056.14] So they could cut by another third, taking 650 down to 20.
[2056.22 → 2057.52] That's 1 30th?
[2057.52 → 2058.10] Is that right?
[2058.18 → 2059.42] 1 30th of the workforce?
[2062.18 → 2062.66] Wow.
[2062.66 → 2069.08] Apparently the pieces per person per month has risen from 8,000 to 21,000.
[2069.18 → 2070.98] That's that production increase we talked about earlier.
[2070.98 → 2074.98] And this company is far from the only one making the change.
[2075.04 → 2080.76] I mean, we've talked about things like McDonald's wanting to roll out restaurants entirely staffed by robots.
[2082.16 → 2089.90] I mean, this is something that, and I'm not going to pretend that either the left or the right have it figured out at this point.
[2090.10 → 2090.20] No.
[2090.20 → 2096.82] But this is something that the politicians have to figure out and have to address.
[2097.52 → 2100.54] Welfare state is going to be a thing.
[2101.20 → 2103.56] Socialism is going to be a thing.
[2103.74 → 2106.24] Or we are all going to starve.
[2106.48 → 2106.66] Yeah.
[2107.24 → 2108.16] Most of us will.
[2109.24 → 2109.76] Period.
[2109.76 → 2109.88] Period.
[2110.88 → 2117.98] There will not be jobs to bring back when robots are doing them.
[2118.58 → 2126.64] And there's been a lot of talk about, like, oh, well, every time that, like, some new major technological shift has happened, there's just been more different jobs.
[2126.98 → 2132.62] Unless, like, literally everyone ends up going into the entertainment sector, which, like, doesn't make sense.
[2133.58 → 2134.64] Unless it does.
[2134.64 → 2136.76] Unless it does.
[2136.94 → 2141.40] But then everyone's going to have to be, like, those jobs will often be paid at ridiculously high amounts.
[2141.46 → 2142.70] So let me propose something here.
[2143.22 → 2147.70] These robots build hard drives that power the cloud.
[2148.64 → 2152.00] The cloud, hold on, let me think for a second here.
[2153.26 → 2155.82] No, no, I had a way for this to work.
[2156.54 → 2156.82] Okay.
[2157.40 → 2161.02] The cloud pays entertainers.
[2161.20 → 2161.80] The cloud.
[2161.98 → 2162.94] So Amazon, okay?
[2162.94 → 2163.28] Okay.
[2163.28 → 2165.84] Amazon's an example of a cloud provider that owns Twitch.
[2165.92 → 2166.08] Yeah.
[2166.28 → 2166.56] Okay?
[2166.76 → 2170.84] So they pay entertainers to play video games.
[2170.84 → 2172.34] Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[2172.92 → 2181.84] They pay entertainers to stream to each other and use the cloud, okay?
[2182.52 → 2189.58] The cloud people go buy food from more robots that make food.
[2189.58 → 2190.06] Yeah.
[2190.30 → 2197.24] And then those robots use that money to build more robots that build more hard drives.
[2198.34 → 2198.94] Okay.
[2200.14 → 2203.40] So the future economy is based on hard drives.
[2204.14 → 2204.76] Yeah.
[2204.90 → 2209.14] Seagate and WD are totally stoked right now.
[2209.14 → 2217.80] And the idea that you have to be both producing entertainment and consuming entertainment at the same time.
[2217.80 → 2219.66] Well, we're going to get real good at multitasking.
[2219.70 → 2219.98] Yeah.
[2219.98 → 2220.10] Yeah.
[2220.70 → 2224.44] I mean, I'm firing up KC Iron's stream right now.
[2225.02 → 2229.08] So there's going to be streams of people watching streams of other people.
[2229.20 → 2229.54] Yes.
[2229.82 → 2231.50] Which is probably already a thing.
[2231.60 → 2232.24] Live reactions.
[2232.24 → 2233.22] That's definitely, yes.
[2233.22 → 2234.28] And then there has to be live reactions.
[2234.28 → 2234.80] Streaming reactions.
[2234.80 → 2235.54] To the live reactions.
[2235.54 → 2235.80] Yes.
[2235.80 → 2235.84] Yes.
[2235.84 → 2241.78] And streaming critique of the state of our society.
[2242.42 → 2242.72] Yes.
[2242.80 → 2249.64] Where live reactions to people reacting live to something that's happening that a robot's doing.
[2250.02 → 2250.18] Oh.
[2250.18 → 2253.32] Is all that's left for humanity at this point.
[2253.42 → 2253.60] Yeah.
[2254.00 → 2257.88] Maybe factory simulator games will get really, really popular.
[2257.88 → 2265.88] And the whole idea of factory simulator is that there are so many automated factories with robots that everything that you could do is in existence somewhere.
[2266.28 → 2271.98] So it just, every time that you build something or like change something in the factory, it just changes you to a live feed of a factory that is like that.
[2272.86 → 2275.92] So factory simulator just becomes like a simulation game.
[2276.82 → 2277.14] Yeah.
[2277.38 → 2278.18] So, um.
[2280.00 → 2280.56] Yeah.
[2282.02 → 2282.50] Yeah.
[2282.50 → 2282.66] Yeah.
[2283.28 → 2283.76] Uh.
[2284.20 → 2287.44] So, speaking of getting paid to be an entertainer.
[2287.88 → 2290.88] I fix it.
[2290.88 → 2291.38] Yeah.
[2292.76 → 2293.32] Um.
[2293.32 → 2297.20] I fix it has a lot of stuff that is probably in my notes.
[2297.26 → 2297.58] Oh, yeah.
[2297.70 → 2298.56] I fix it's great.
[2298.64 → 2299.58] We love I fix it.
[2299.70 → 2302.34] In fact, I think I know I was using the kit.
[2302.42 → 2303.34] That's why it's not there.
[2303.82 → 2306.58] It's in the yeah, that one.
[2306.66 → 2307.86] And I think there's one there.
[2308.20 → 2310.10] Because I was taking something apart with it.
[2310.20 → 2310.50] Anyway.
[2310.96 → 2315.32] I fix it builds amazing tools for taking apart and putting back together.
[2315.32 → 2318.26] And repairing and upgrading your electronics.
[2318.26 → 2333.46] They've got everything from their, like, complete one bag to hold them all solution that's got, like, their magnetic screw holder, their, you know, microfiber cloth, their multiple different screwdriver sets.
[2333.52 → 2333.64] Yeah.
[2333.70 → 2334.08] It's okay.
[2334.08 → 2335.22] Someone's probably using it.
[2335.24 → 2335.54] It's fine.
[2335.98 → 2344.64] All the way from, like, the whole bag down to the Protect toolkit, which has all the little prying tools you need for taking apart mobile devices, suction cups, all that good stuff.
[2344.90 → 2348.16] Down to this one, which is the Essentials.
[2348.24 → 2348.86] Oh, no.
[2348.96 → 2351.06] One of the, uh, guitar picks fell out.
[2351.60 → 2356.04] This is the Essentials, um, electronic toolkit.
[2356.04 → 2361.96] So it's got one of their trademark spiders, which is a poking and prying tool.
[2362.38 → 2368.62] It's got their old version of their driver with, uh, what is it, 16 bits.
[2368.80 → 2370.80] It's got their ESD-safe tweezers.
[2370.90 → 2372.28] It's got one of their suction cups.
[2372.68 → 2377.14] It's got one of their, uh, one of their, like, knife things and one of their other prying tools.
[2377.24 → 2377.88] They're all great.
[2378.14 → 2380.34] These prying tools specifically, I love those.
[2380.40 → 2381.06] I use them all the time.
[2381.06 → 2388.96] These are the bomb, the number of times that I have accidentally damaged, uh, something by using a prying tool that, like, scratched it.
[2389.60 → 2389.98] Lots.
[2390.16 → 2390.86] Um, and...
[2390.86 → 2391.86] Lots when it wasn't that one.
[2391.94 → 2393.78] There's little things that they think of.
[2393.86 → 2394.52] Like, check this out.
[2394.56 → 2395.44] This is how you pull it out.
[2396.00 → 2396.40] Yeah.
[2396.90 → 2397.12] See?
[2397.30 → 2399.64] Because there's a little, uh, there's a little cavity there.
[2399.82 → 2401.28] So you can just pull it out like that.
[2401.72 → 2402.30] Pretty cool, right?
[2403.34 → 2404.16] So that's it.
[2404.16 → 2407.82] I recommend pulling out, and I recommend using fixity toolkits.
[2407.82 → 2419.76] And you can save on an fixity toolkit by heading to ifixit.com slash Linus and using offer WAN show to save 5% on a purchase of $10 or more.
[2421.34 → 2423.76] Also sponsoring the WAN show today.
[2424.00 → 2426.92] I think I do remember something about this.
[2427.10 → 2431.78] But we weren't going to do it until we finally upgraded the WAN show set.
[2432.22 → 2435.82] And we were actually using their capture cards.
[2435.82 → 2443.54] So we worked out a deal with Epiphany where I basically went, okay, look, we need capture cards that aren't terrible.
[2443.90 → 2449.58] Uh, in the, in the upgrade vlog, you guys are going to see the capture card and microphone graveyard that we keep under the table here.
[2449.94 → 2452.80] Um, we had tried so many different ones.
[2452.86 → 2457.98] So I was talking to Epiphany, and I was like, look, we need capture cards that actually work.
[2457.98 → 2458.82] So here's the deal.
[2459.32 → 2462.16] You guys sent us some capture cards that actually work.
[2462.44 → 2468.86] We're going to use them for a couple of months to ensure that we are 100% certain they actually work.
[2468.86 → 2477.06] And then we are going to do our part to get the word out there that Epiphany capture cards actually freaking work.
[2477.22 → 2478.28] So here we are.
[2478.42 → 2479.48] We are months in.
[2479.74 → 2485.08] The only issues that we've had with them have been due to overwhelming a single USB controller,
[2485.32 → 2491.02] which we were able to solve actually a couple of weeks ago by popping in a PCIe USB controller card.
[2491.02 → 2493.86] And now I am pleased as punch.
[2494.02 → 2494.94] You plug them in.
[2495.08 → 2497.72] They automatically detect the resolution and the frame rate.
[2497.84 → 2500.66] Everything is ready to rock instantaneously.
[2501.28 → 2503.38] The streaming quality looks great.
[2503.86 → 2506.82] And they, yeah, what can I, they just work.
[2506.92 → 2508.46] I think that was all I was really asking for.
[2509.14 → 2509.78] They just work.
[2509.86 → 2512.62] And they've got actually some recent firmware updates that make them better,
[2513.04 → 2517.50] great for not just like professional video streaming and whatever else.
[2517.58 → 2519.08] They're great for PC capture as well.
[2519.08 → 2521.44] So they do 2560 by 1440p now.
[2521.64 → 2522.08] Oh, nice.
[2522.26 → 2522.46] Yeah.
[2522.62 → 2523.22] That's cool.
[2523.36 → 2525.74] So they actually do like PC resolutions and stuff like that.
[2525.78 → 2526.90] Like they really do care.
[2526.98 → 2527.88] And they're a Canadian company.
[2528.28 → 2528.54] Yeah.
[2528.76 → 2531.16] They're like, and like, it says right on the made in Canada.
[2531.26 → 2532.72] I was like, they're on the ISS.
[2533.60 → 2534.58] I did not know that.
[2534.72 → 2535.68] They use them for video capture.
[2536.20 → 2537.88] This is the second time I've told you on stream.
[2538.02 → 2538.22] Really?
[2538.22 → 2539.20] Sometimes you've reacted the same way.
[2539.20 → 2539.42] Oh.
[2539.80 → 2540.76] I must have forgotten.
[2541.00 → 2541.24] I'm sorry.
[2541.36 → 2541.98] No, it's cool.
[2543.18 → 2544.98] I just, I find that part very cool.
[2545.38 → 2547.74] Anyway, they've got a fantastic lineup.
[2547.74 → 2553.82] Everything from the AVIS, SDI, HD, and 4K, which are the ones that we use predominantly.
[2554.30 → 2559.74] So if you've noticed the dramatic improvement in the quality of our video capture in our videos,
[2560.14 → 2561.52] that's thanks to Epiphany.
[2561.52 → 2570.44] That combined with that BenQ monitor that has HDMI pass-through allows us to capture exactly what's happening through multiple reboots.
[2570.44 → 2573.38] Because Epiphany just switches resolutions on the fly.
[2573.50 → 2576.30] So if you like blue screen, it captures the whole experience.
[2576.44 → 2577.32] The BIOS coming up.
[2577.68 → 2579.76] Now we have ways to just capture everything.
[2579.86 → 2583.52] And we can do it without interfering with the test bench system at all.
[2583.52 → 2587.74] Because everything's being done through an HDMI splitter that's built into the monitor.
[2587.86 → 2589.66] And then it goes out to a completely separate system.
[2589.98 → 2592.14] I think we may have love-hugged their website.
[2592.46 → 2593.68] And their website might be down.
[2594.54 → 2595.52] Sorry, Epiphany.
[2595.68 → 2601.12] But if you Google Epiphany on the ISS, you can find a few different articles.
[2601.28 → 2603.20] One of the top ones is Epiphany takes pro...
[2603.20 → 2604.20] Oh, it's starting to load.
[2604.76 → 2609.00] It says Epiphany takes pro AV aboard the International Space Station.
[2609.00 → 2611.78] And another one is about how they brought it to a NASA tech fair.
[2612.26 → 2613.38] So that's sort of cool.
[2613.44 → 2615.68] If you want to read about that.
[2615.96 → 2617.30] I like that a lot.
[2617.40 → 2619.10] Because I like space things and NASA and stuff.
[2619.32 → 2622.32] Anyway, they also have PCI Express cards.
[2622.44 → 2625.64] So their DVI to PCI-E Duo is another one that we have.
[2625.70 → 2629.26] That one is a little bit more manual in terms of the setup.
[2629.52 → 2633.40] So the one that I really recommend if you're looking for a grab-and-go solution...
[2633.40 → 2635.10] I almost always have one in my backpack.
[2635.10 → 2639.14] Is the AVID 4K is my personal favourite.
[2639.52 → 2641.30] We use the SDI for our camera.
[2641.50 → 2642.82] Because we've got an SDI camera.
[2643.20 → 2646.02] And then we use the HD for just my computer here.
[2646.10 → 2648.72] Because we don't need 4K for a 1080 stream.
[2649.14 → 2649.66] But yeah.
[2649.84 → 2650.20] Love it.
[2650.42 → 2651.30] Love everything about it.
[2651.60 → 2655.14] Check it out at epiphan.com slash AVID slash WAN.
[2655.28 → 2656.78] Remember to go there later as well.
[2656.86 → 2658.48] If you're having troubles connecting to that right now.
[2658.54 → 2658.64] Yeah.
[2659.14 → 2660.12] It's good stuff.
[2660.20 → 2662.20] And it's actually not unreasonably priced either.
[2662.64 → 2663.60] Which is great.
[2663.60 → 2667.32] If you just want to pay a couple bucks more and get something that actually works.
[2668.70 → 2669.54] All right.
[2669.82 → 2670.22] Yeah.
[2670.28 → 2671.84] A bunch of other people are saying that it's out.
[2672.74 → 2673.14] Sorry.
[2673.38 → 2673.82] Sorry, Epiphany.
[2673.82 → 2674.52] Sorry, Epiphany.
[2674.58 → 2675.04] We tried.
[2675.22 → 2675.42] Yeah.
[2677.64 → 2678.30] All right.
[2678.40 → 2681.28] So in a surprise move that surprised no one.
[2681.38 → 2684.40] This was posted by KuruFinWi underscore wins.
[2684.54 → 2684.72] Wow.
[2684.84 → 2686.42] Worst username ever award.
[2686.52 → 2686.84] You win.
[2688.04 → 2691.46] NVIDIA announces their Q4 2017 results.
[2692.06 → 2693.00] Record profit.
[2693.00 → 2693.50] Yep.
[2694.68 → 2695.24] Record.
[2695.42 → 2696.18] Record quarter.
[2696.38 → 2697.00] Gross revenue.
[2697.14 → 2698.98] 2.173 billion.
[2699.78 → 2703.50] This is up 700 million from their previous Q4.
[2703.68 → 2704.16] Unreal.
[2706.26 → 2709.86] Net income is at 655 million.
[2710.06 → 2712.30] I mean, this is just unfathomable numbers, hey?
[2712.86 → 2713.30] Yeah.
[2713.30 → 2714.48] Wow.
[2715.64 → 2716.68] That's unbelievable.
[2716.68 → 2716.78] Poor AMD.
[2716.78 → 2718.78] Poor AMD.
[2719.08 → 2720.86] They posted their results two weeks ago.
[2720.94 → 2722.62] 1.11 billion in revenue.
[2722.76 → 2723.92] Loss of 51 million.
[2724.06 → 2726.42] And they're in the CPU and GPU market.
[2728.42 → 2728.90] Unbelievable.
[2728.90 → 2729.90] Unbelievable.
[2729.90 → 2732.08] So yearly numbers.
[2732.08 → 2733.08] 6.9 billion.
[2733.08 → 2737.30] 6.91 billion revenue compared to 5 billion the year before.
[2737.80 → 2745.04] Like when you're as much of a monster as NVIDIA is, I kind of go, yeah, how do you grow like 30% year over year?
[2745.16 → 2746.54] Well, apparently they figured it out.
[2749.04 → 2749.56] Unreal.
[2750.08 → 2752.28] Crush your only singular competition?
[2752.28 → 2754.12] Yeah, I guess so.
[2754.12 → 2754.44] I don't know.
[2755.26 → 2757.70] So here's their quarterly revenue trend.
[2758.56 → 2759.20] Look at that.
[2759.86 → 2762.16] They were doing 1 billion and change.
[2763.24 → 2763.84] Boom.
[2764.00 → 2765.14] Second half of this year.
[2765.66 → 2767.08] Just on fire.
[2767.20 → 2773.84] I mean, remember too, NVIDIA is one of the biggest benefactors of things like deep learning.
[2774.80 → 2776.98] Things like autonomous driving.
[2777.60 → 2780.36] I mean, that is NVIDIA's wheelhouse right now.
[2780.36 → 2795.44] And AMD is going to have to demonstrate to someone like a car manufacturer in a big way that they're still going to exist in 5 to 10 years if they're going to expect these guys to buy into the ecosystem.
[2796.20 → 2797.66] This is very, very important.
[2797.78 → 2802.58] There's more to it than just, well, AMD GPUs are great for this kind of processing too.
[2802.58 → 2816.00] If you're investing in building out like a supercomputer or something, there's no such thing as buying from a company that you can't trust in addition to it having great performance or great specs or whatever the case may be.
[2818.82 → 2819.34] Okay.
[2819.54 → 2821.48] So this was posted by Mule on the forum.
[2821.58 → 2824.04] The original article is from the Steam community here.
[2825.12 → 2826.06] Very interesting.
[2826.22 → 2828.58] Green light is going away.
[2828.58 → 2831.88] Fascinating.
[2834.00 → 2835.88] I'm trying to find information on this.
[2835.96 → 2839.82] I believe the BMW autonomous car was running NVIDIA tech in it.
[2840.34 → 2842.04] If I recall correctly, it was.
[2842.16 → 2843.28] But I don't remember what it was.
[2843.50 → 2844.20] I suspect.
[2845.68 → 2847.12] The car companies are funny.
[2847.40 → 2847.58] Yeah.
[2847.68 → 2853.26] Where a lot of it, they're not going to just say like the BMW X drive, whatever the crap.
[2853.26 → 2859.96] Do you want a GTX Titan XP or a, you know, 1080?
[2860.48 → 2866.64] And that affects like, you know, how many pedestrians you can dodge before you smack into a wall or whatever.
[2866.72 → 2868.34] Like, it doesn't really work that way.
[2868.42 → 2871.72] They're just going to say with like, you know, NVIDIA.
[2872.06 → 2874.24] It's hilarious that NVIDIA is like compute card.
[2874.34 → 2879.46] The Tesla would be a name that no car manufacturer other than Tesla would be willing to say.
[2879.52 → 2881.54] And even for Tesla, it would be like a really weird message.
[2881.54 → 2882.02] Yes.
[2882.32 → 2888.52] But they might just say with NVIDIA, you know, deep learning technology or something like that.
[2888.58 → 2889.56] Like, there's going to be something else.
[2889.64 → 2893.82] So it looks like they're working with BMW, Mini Cooper, Tesla, Audi, and Mercedes-Benz.
[2894.18 → 2894.44] Okay.
[2894.70 → 2895.40] NVIDIA is.
[2895.60 → 2899.46] But they're not saying like, exactly to what extent or blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[2899.58 → 2902.28] But like, that's their partners for autonomous driving.
[2903.42 → 2906.80] So the new system that Valve's introducing will be called Steam Direct.
[2907.00 → 2908.76] It's expected to go live this spring.
[2908.76 → 2911.88] They've been dissatisfied with Steam Greenlight for a while.
[2911.96 → 2913.30] That's good because so were a lot of people.
[2914.10 → 2918.42] Gabe Newell described the system as probably bad for the Steam community.
[2921.58 → 2923.52] I like how he's pretty blunt about things.
[2923.58 → 2925.84] Stated that the goal was to make Greenlight go away.
[2925.96 → 2928.50] Not because it's not useful, but because they're evolving.
[2928.70 → 2933.66] So Steam Direct will enable developers to get their games on Steam without having to pass an approval process first.
[2933.66 → 2940.94] They will ask developers to complete a set of digital paperwork, personal or company verification, and tax documents similar to signing up for a bank account.
[2941.36 → 2945.70] Once they're set up, they will pay a recoupable application fee for each title they wish to distribute.
[2946.42 → 2951.00] It's intended to decrease the amount of bad games submitted to Greenlight as a joke.
[2951.74 → 2955.48] Valve has said there are now more than 100 Greenlight games that have earned at least a million each.
[2955.76 → 2958.56] Many of which wouldn't have been on Steam in the first place if it weren't for Greenlight.
[2958.64 → 2961.10] So they're not saying Greenlight, we should have never done it.
[2961.10 → 2962.74] They're adding some barrier to entry.
[2962.98 → 2963.36] Yes.
[2963.66 → 2968.30] And it's recoupable, so I'm not entirely sure what that means.
[2969.18 → 2969.86] All right.
[2969.94 → 2970.34] To be completely honest.
[2970.34 → 2978.78] It's probably like part of Valve's fee every time you sell a game doesn't exist until you've paid off that recoupable amount.
[2978.78 → 2979.30] That makes sense.
[2979.50 → 2979.64] Yep.
[2979.84 → 2981.08] And then you're back in it.
[2981.24 → 2985.26] I mean, I've talked to folks like guys over at extremesystems.org.
[2985.36 → 2988.22] They added a $1 fee to sign up for their forum.
[2988.22 → 2992.08] And they were like, yeah, the dollar is meaningless.
[2992.48 → 2997.78] It means nothing compared to the administration and hosting costs and all that stuff.
[2998.00 → 2999.90] The point is it's anti-spammer.
[3000.14 → 3000.28] Yeah.
[3000.44 → 3010.06] So someone has to submit a dollar with some kind of financial institution and the spam was gone.
[3010.30 → 3012.16] And I'm sure it was and that would help a lot too.
[3012.24 → 3013.12] We're not going to do that.
[3013.32 → 3013.48] No.
[3013.48 → 3016.46] But I can totally understand the benefits of that.
[3016.80 → 3016.96] Yep.
[3017.10 → 3022.66] We hurt because of troll jerks all the time.
[3023.36 → 3023.58] Yep.
[3023.68 → 3030.58] We have a pretty substantial mod team of awesome people because of all the terrible things that are attempted to be done on the forum.
[3030.80 → 3032.24] And we deal with them and it's fine.
[3032.68 → 3033.10] All right.
[3033.18 → 3039.60] Speaking of terrible things and dealing with it, you were not super stoked on Nintendo's game lineup for the Switch.
[3039.68 → 3041.22] Does this give you any hope?
[3041.22 → 3043.02] This was posted by Goodbyes on the forum.
[3043.20 → 3045.46] I don't think a ton of people were super stoked on it.
[3045.68 → 3048.12] Like there's a lot of problems with their game lineup.
[3048.88 → 3061.56] One thing that this is – one thing about this that is good is that third-party publishers seem to be coming to the Switch a lot more than they were with the Wii U.
[3061.82 → 3063.18] From 70 publishers.
[3063.54 → 3064.84] 70 publishers is pretty good.
[3064.84 → 3070.64] A lot of the publishers seem to be liking the fact that it's mobile.
[3071.30 → 3073.58] That seems to be a huge draw for people.
[3074.64 → 3075.96] Mobile but not a phone.
[3076.46 → 3076.56] Yes.
[3076.56 → 3078.22] You don't have to go through Google or Apple.
[3078.36 → 3080.28] You don't have to compete in the App Store.
[3080.66 → 3080.84] Yeah.
[3081.34 → 3084.86] And even the cartridges are very mobile.
[3084.98 → 3086.24] They look like 3DS cartridges.
[3086.40 → 3087.22] They are not the same.
[3087.32 → 3088.10] They are not compatible.
[3088.22 → 3089.16] It doesn't work that way.
[3089.16 → 3094.32] But they look really similar, which is good because you can haul them around with you very easily.
[3094.92 → 3096.88] There's a huge amount of expandable storage.
[3097.06 → 3104.20] If you want to be a just downloadable title, there are a lot of titles coming to Switch that are only downloaded that will not be getting physical carts.
[3104.20 → 3117.76] So if you're playing those games, you're going to need to buy a big SD card real quick because the 32 gigabytes of onboard storage, which part of that's going to be taken away by the operating system, is going to disappear fast.
[3117.84 → 3118.54] Real fast.
[3118.94 → 3125.16] So expect to be adding the cost of an SD card to your system if you ever plan on downloading games.
[3125.24 → 3125.34] Yeah.
[3125.42 → 3130.14] Sales of like 256 gig SD cards are going to be like money.
[3130.14 → 3136.02] It will be eventually when they exist compatible with two terabyte micro SD cards.
[3136.86 → 3138.26] So, yeah.
[3140.16 → 3141.50] That'll be a thing eventually.
[3143.02 → 3144.60] But yeah, it's better.
[3144.96 → 3150.18] The main disappointment that I had was the first party titles, actually.
[3150.58 → 3150.94] Right.
[3151.18 → 3152.16] The fact that it's just –
[3152.16 → 3154.32] Well, you buy Nintendo for Nintendo.
[3154.56 → 3155.14] Yes, I do.
[3155.26 → 3155.42] Yeah.
[3155.54 → 3156.54] So that's what made me sad.
[3156.56 → 3158.38] Do you own any third party titles for the Wii U?
[3158.84 → 3159.24] Some.
[3160.14 → 3161.24] But not very many.
[3161.64 → 3161.88] Right.
[3162.14 → 3162.36] Yeah.
[3162.48 → 3164.16] Most of it's first party stuff.
[3164.32 → 3166.40] There are definitely a few that I own, but not very many.
[3166.60 → 3170.98] Like it's one of those things where for the Wii – I have to go back that far to the last time I bought a console.
[3171.14 → 3174.50] But for the Wii, I bought Super Monkey Ball for it.
[3174.66 → 3179.92] And I was just like, this is a lot more games than Wii Sports.
[3179.92 → 3182.30] But Wii Sports was free.
[3182.30 → 3189.24] And every single one of the games in Wii Sports has so much more replay value than these mini-games in Super Monkey Ball.
[3189.24 → 3192.14] That's a huge issue and disappointment with the Switch.
[3192.30 → 3193.78] There is no free-included game.
[3194.34 → 3194.48] Right.
[3194.48 → 3199.12] And one thing that really helped the Wii was the inclusion of Wii Sports.
[3199.12 → 3200.66] Wii Sports is a great game.
[3200.86 → 3204.40] And this should really have 1-2-Switch included.
[3204.80 → 3204.94] Right.
[3204.94 → 3209.16] Because 1-2-Switch – I don't think a lot of people understand the benefit and the fun of 1-2-Switch.
[3209.24 → 3210.66] It just looks like a stupid game at first.
[3210.96 → 3213.74] But if you like think about it for a while, it's actually really cool.
[3213.74 → 3219.08] And a very good party game and a very good game for bringing the Switch with you on the road.
[3219.34 → 3219.50] Right.
[3219.62 → 3220.80] Because you don't have to look at the screen.
[3221.20 → 3224.94] So just setting it up in tabletop mode and then playing while looking at each other.
[3225.04 → 3225.34] Right.
[3225.70 → 3226.58] Makes a ton of sense.
[3226.70 → 3228.76] Getting people into gaming that –
[3228.76 → 3229.28] Is social.
[3229.80 → 3231.18] Aren't necessarily into games.
[3231.26 → 3231.42] Right.
[3231.74 → 3234.82] It's super easy because you can play things that are more sport-like.
[3237.24 → 3238.56] It makes a huge amount of sense.
[3238.64 → 3241.14] But it is a full-cost game.
[3241.46 → 3243.42] It's like $70 or something.
[3244.28 → 3246.48] Like, oh, man.
[3246.96 → 3247.70] I don't know.
[3247.78 → 3252.68] I don't think they're going to move as many as they probably should be.
[3253.00 → 3253.32] Yeah.
[3253.44 → 3253.94] I don't know.
[3254.06 → 3256.20] Like, my son plays Wii Sports more than he plays VR.
[3256.90 → 3257.18] Yeah.
[3257.36 → 3259.28] And, like, Wii Sports brought everyone to the Wii.
[3259.52 → 3259.72] Yeah.
[3259.82 → 3261.36] My mom was super stoked by Wii Sports.
[3261.50 → 3261.64] Yep.
[3261.72 → 3263.86] Everyone that played the Wii was super stoked by Wii Sports.
[3263.86 → 3269.16] Wii Sports is the reason that I own four Wii motes, two nun chucks.
[3269.46 → 3269.66] Yep.
[3269.66 → 3275.44] And instead of one Wii mote and one nun chuck and, like –
[3275.44 → 3276.34] Maybe a pro controller.
[3277.30 → 3280.26] And, well, they didn't exist when I was still buying Wii accessories.
[3280.76 → 3281.78] But a Game Cube controller.
[3281.96 → 3282.16] Yeah.
[3282.36 → 3285.84] For, like – so that I could have – and maybe a classic controller.
[3286.14 → 3286.22] Yeah.
[3286.22 → 3291.50] Like, that – it's the reason that I own two to three times as many Wii peripherals as I did.
[3291.74 → 3292.00] Totally.
[3292.00 → 3294.60] Because, like, the in-laws wanted to play, too.
[3295.76 → 3296.16] Anyway.
[3296.24 → 3300.34] Like, one of the biggest excited things that I have about the Switch is getting one to Switch
[3300.34 → 3302.68] and then playing random, like, mini-games with Emma.
[3303.12 → 3303.42] Right.
[3304.02 → 3309.66] Because then it's a way to make it so that – like, it's so – the idea of making it so that you're playing a video game
[3309.66 → 3311.98] but you're facing each other is super cool.
[3312.68 → 3313.26] I don't know.
[3313.40 → 3313.84] NVIDIA.
[3314.78 → 3315.94] Well, NVIDIA, too.
[3316.02 → 3316.88] I mean, their hardware is in it.
[3316.96 → 3319.96] But Nintendo is apparently very bullish on the Switch.
[3320.42 → 3324.48] So they're saying that, um, blah, blah, blah, after the presentation, we receive more requests
[3324.48 → 3326.38] and more and more software publishers, et cetera, et cetera.
[3326.84 → 3328.72] Unannounced new titles will be detailed in the future.
[3329.38 → 3334.60] Reiterated that Nintendo plans to ship 2 million of the new console worldwide by the end of March.
[3335.36 → 3338.12] That is, uh, pretty aggressive.
[3338.12 → 3339.68] They're sold out freaking everywhere.
[3340.34 → 3341.70] Like, actually everywhere.
[3342.04 → 3347.20] Now, it's not that surprising because Nintendo is kind of one of those guys that is totally down with, like,
[3347.34 → 3348.78] artificial limitation of stock.
[3348.78 → 3350.60] Um, but, yeah.
[3350.60 → 3357.02] Like, the way that Wii's were arriving before Christmas that year was, like, you guys had these.
[3357.16 → 3357.34] Yeah.
[3357.76 → 3358.08] Yeah.
[3359.26 → 3363.18] You're just – you're just trickling them out because you're jerks.
[3363.32 → 3363.52] Yeah.
[3363.80 → 3365.62] But, hey, I made a lot of money on that.
[3365.88 → 3366.08] Yeah.
[3366.14 → 3367.50] I got a free Wii, effectively.
[3367.56 → 3369.98] I was so – have I told you my story of buying a Wii?
[3370.24 → 3370.46] No.
[3370.62 → 3372.06] I was, like, interested in buying one.
[3372.08 → 3373.92] I don't remember if I worked at Best Buy at this time or not.
[3373.92 → 3378.34] Um, but I was walking by one of the like, end-of-mile kiosks things.
[3378.78 → 3382.42] And an employee from the warehousing section just walks out with a Wii.
[3382.60 → 3383.36] And I'm like, oh, okay.
[3383.42 → 3384.84] Someone got one of their reserved Wii's.
[3385.48 → 3387.08] Plunk puts it on the thing.
[3387.12 → 3388.00] I'm like, okay.
[3388.16 → 3390.10] Just picked it up immediately, went and bought it.
[3390.16 → 3394.24] And I'm, like, basically 100% certain that was supposed to be someone else's unit.
[3394.64 → 3394.96] Oh.
[3394.96 → 3397.04] And it just, like, got screwed up in the inventory system.
[3397.10 → 3397.38] Wow.
[3397.38 → 3398.34] And they put it out on the shelf.
[3398.42 → 3399.20] I camped twice.
[3399.28 → 3400.18] I think I've told you that.
[3400.28 → 3400.44] Yeah.
[3400.44 → 3400.80] Yeah.
[3400.94 → 3402.46] So that was – it was really fun.
[3402.60 → 3403.82] Like, I did it with my wife.
[3403.96 → 3404.70] I used to like camping.
[3404.78 → 3405.66] We both camped out.
[3405.80 → 3408.96] That's the – I think it's one of the – I don't think I've ever camped for anything else.
[3409.32 → 3410.46] I've camped for quite a few things.
[3410.58 → 3413.56] Halo 2 was my favourite game that I ever camped for.
[3413.84 → 3414.12] Peasant.
[3414.56 → 3416.08] Have I ever told you about that?
[3416.62 → 3423.02] So I had bought the like, magazine that talked about – that had, like, the Halo exclusive details in it and all that kind of stuff.
[3423.08 → 3424.30] I think it was Xbox magazine.
[3424.76 → 3425.50] Physical magazine.
[3425.62 → 3426.52] This was a long time ago.
[3426.66 → 3426.80] Okay.
[3427.24 → 3430.32] And I had read the entire thing many times.
[3430.38 → 3432.78] Like, this was, like, a worn magazine by the time we were in lineup.
[3433.20 → 3437.32] And they had a guy come out who was giving swag away based on if you could answer questions.
[3437.78 → 3440.54] So I was the first person to put my hand up every single time.
[3440.54 → 3448.56] I got every single answer right to the point where they started vocally being, like, we're not answering questions from you – or we're not taking answers from you anymore.
[3448.74 → 3454.78] And they would scan other people, and then they would keep on getting it wrong, and they'd eventually come back to me, and then I'd answer it correct.
[3457.24 → 3458.40] It was so good.
[3458.68 → 3465.84] Someone backed up to the lineup with a truck, and they powered a big CRT TV off their truck, and everyone was playing Halo 1 out of the back of their truck.
[3466.00 → 3466.26] Nice.
[3466.28 → 3467.06] That was sick.
[3467.46 → 3468.18] Really cool.
[3468.36 → 3469.74] I actually used to enjoy that stuff.
[3469.74 → 3470.68] That's funny.
[3470.76 → 3474.98] That is one thing I miss about, like, physical magazines and manuals and stuff.
[3475.10 → 3480.28] Like, my Final Fantasy VI manual, like, I've read, like, all the stupid character backstories.
[3480.40 → 3481.56] I mean, I was a kid at the time, right?
[3481.64 → 3484.04] But, like, I've read through all the different spells.
[3484.26 → 3496.42] Like, it's stuff like this that I guess you kind of forget about being a kid, where, like, you're still, you know, you're still, like, at some early stage in the game.
[3496.42 → 3502.88] And, you know, you just want to, like, read about spells that, like, maybe someday terrible cast.
[3502.88 → 3503.72] Oh, my God.
[3503.72 → 3507.58] My Borrowing player's guide.
[3507.58 → 3513.80] The original one that I had, the like, cover fell off because I opened it and closed it so many times, and the spine is, like, damaged from being used too much.
[3514.82 → 3515.34] It's awesome.
[3515.34 → 3527.08] And then there's my Skyrim player's guide that I bought out of, like, expected need, which is still in absolutely perfect condition because you do not need a player's guide for that game at all because it's so hand-hold.
[3527.56 → 3531.96] Old school Borrowing, like, playing that game without a player's guide, you'll just miss a lot of stuff.
[3532.56 → 3536.08] If you play the game with a player's guide, it's literally just a way to find content.
[3536.08 → 3539.12] And the way that the player's guide is written is, like, spoilers later.
[3539.82 → 3546.98] They'll, like, bring you to the quest and, like, make sure you can start it, and then it turns into, like, if you need help, and then there's, like, spoilers at the end.
[3547.14 → 3551.88] So you can use it to find things instead of just, like, walking you through the game.
[3552.04 → 3561.22] So I'd use it to, like, lead me to where I need to go to do something, and then if I got actually stuck, then I could check that, but it was rather uncommon, and you'd just use it to lead you through the game.
[3563.16 → 3563.48] Yeah.
[3563.94 → 3564.48] That was fun.
[3564.48 → 3565.48] Okay.
[3565.48 → 3566.42] I miss you.
[3566.42 → 3566.44] I miss you.
[3566.44 → 3566.54] I miss you.
[3566.54 → 3566.82] Okay.
[3567.50 → 3569.28] So there are a couple fun things.
[3570.14 → 3574.02] Yoda, the bill, so this was originally posted by F.org.
[3574.10 → 3578.98] Yoda, the bill that would let you own and sell your devices is reintroduced by Congress.
[3580.46 → 3581.06] Wow.
[3581.60 → 3582.36] All right.
[3584.24 → 3586.76] This looks like a bipartisan effort.
[3586.92 → 3587.46] Look at that.
[3588.08 → 3591.24] Blake Parenthood and Jared Polis.
[3591.24 → 3604.06] So Republican and Democratic just reintroduced their You Own Devices Act, a bill that aims to help you reclaim some of your ownership rights in the software-enabled devices that you buy.
[3604.30 → 3607.32] What a friendly thing for the government to be doing.
[3607.32 → 3615.92] If a computer program enables a device to operate, Yoda would let you transfer ownership of a copy of that computer program along with the device.
[3615.92 → 3629.24] The law overrides any agreement to the contrary, like an abusive EULA, and you have the right to receive security or bug fixes if someone who also had the right to receive security and bug fixes passes the device along to you.
[3629.36 → 3629.98] That's very cool.
[3629.98 → 3632.20] Very, very cool.
[3633.52 → 3643.90] That's like I'm very happy that I have been aware of the idea that I might have to buy Blu-rays or DVDs of certain movies that I like because for the longest time everyone was like, oh, it's just – it'll be on Netflix.
[3644.04 → 3644.50] It's fine.
[3644.58 → 3646.96] And Netflix is like dropping that super hard.
[3648.56 → 3649.50] So, yeah.
[3649.50 → 3650.88] Twitch Communities Beta.
[3651.04 → 3666.68] This was posted by CP Larger on the forum and basically is a way for us to not be sort of on the – sort of in the gray area of people who are supposed to be streaming on Twitch because we don't stream games here.
[3667.90 → 3668.56] So, basically –
[3668.56 → 3675.36] Dedicated to things like cosplay, drawing, painting, comedy, food, music, and us, I guess.
[3675.54 → 3675.86] Yeah.
[3676.06 → 3676.40] Cool.
[3676.40 → 3680.00] They're saying users can set up their own communities if they choose.
[3680.12 → 3683.54] We've heard from our streamers and viewers that they want the freedom to form specific groups.
[3684.02 → 3692.52] So, some of these categories – it initially contains hundreds of them – build on top of gamers' interests and some of them just straight up don't.
[3692.52 → 3699.02] So, inside communities will be a stream wall which displays live content from creators who are choosing to broadcast to the community.
[3699.76 → 3705.86] And broadcasters associating themselves with the community could give them more exposure for their content, allowing them to pick up more fans.
[3706.14 → 3706.32] Cool.
[3706.40 → 3706.54] Cool.
[3706.54 → 3706.82] Good for them.
[3707.72 → 3708.96] What else we got here?
[3709.56 → 3710.58] Something about Cody.
[3710.86 → 3712.72] Oh, NASA built a chip to survive on Venus.
[3713.22 → 3713.82] Something.
[3713.92 → 3714.86] 800 degree Fahrenheit.
[3715.04 → 3715.54] That's pretty neat.
[3715.80 → 3716.00] Yeah.
[3718.00 → 3719.68] Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.
[3720.14 → 3720.44] Oh.
[3722.84 → 3726.10] Google's Super Bowl – Super Bowl – what is it?
[3726.12 → 3727.04] Super Bowl Lee ad?
[3727.80 → 3730.58] Lee as in like L-I, like Roman numerals.
[3732.04 → 3732.44] Oh.
[3733.32 → 3733.92] Like 51.
[3733.92 → 3734.02] 51.
[3734.18 → 3734.60] Is that right?
[3734.60 → 3734.84] Yeah.
[3734.84 → 3736.66] Super Bowl 51 ad from Google.
[3737.14 → 3740.36] Wreaked havoc on customers who already own a Google Home system.
[3740.46 → 3742.02] This was posted by Tech Dreamer on the forum.
[3742.08 → 3742.72] That's pretty funny.
[3743.60 → 3749.04] So, Google's use of OK Google sends people's homes into a frenzy.
[3749.24 → 3751.36] So, that's pretty funny, I guess.
[3751.50 → 3757.00] And on that note, because we started the WAN show somewhat on time, we're actually going to end it somewhat on time.
[3757.00 → 3761.08] So, that I won't actually be late for my class.
[3761.36 → 3762.16] Were you late last week?
[3762.38 → 3764.74] I was late, but mostly because of the snow.
[3765.06 → 3767.68] I left on time, but the snow was terrible.
[3767.80 → 3768.58] The roads were awful.
[3768.80 → 3768.92] Yeah.
[3769.08 → 3770.92] I got stuck on the hill right there.
[3770.92 → 3774.82] I had to push people into parking spots when I went home last night.
[3775.44 → 3776.54] Like, more than one person.
[3776.62 → 3777.86] I rolled backwards down it.
[3778.34 → 3778.56] No, no.
[3778.58 → 3784.54] I got stuck on the hill and like had to go back down it carefully and take a run at it.
[3784.54 → 3786.76] And then hope that the light would go green.
[3786.94 → 3787.98] So, I still had momentum.
[3788.18 → 3788.98] Yeah, it was terrible.
[3789.22 → 3790.08] Oh, man.
[3790.56 → 3790.90] Anyway.
[3791.16 → 3791.84] Oh, this.
[3794.16 → 3794.60] No.
[3795.12 → 3795.34] No.
[3795.48 → 3795.86] Not this week.
[3795.92 → 3796.54] Not this week.
[3796.60 → 3796.76] Yeah.
[3796.76 → 3797.44] Got it.
[3797.86 → 3798.20] Okay.
[3798.44 → 3801.68] So, can we talk about the idea that we have?
[3803.00 → 3804.24] Maybe let's just not.
[3804.38 → 3805.02] Boiler would.
[3805.62 → 3805.94] Yeah.
[3806.04 → 3807.54] I don't want Boiler to get upset.
[3809.00 → 3815.48] What we will do, though, is we will remind you all that we do have an early access platform.
[3816.80 → 3822.96] I was kind of thinking maybe I would talk about it during the sponsors part of the show.
[3823.12 → 3825.50] Like, we could be our own sponsor for the show or something.
[3825.62 → 3825.84] Anyway.
[3826.06 → 3826.36] Okay.
[3826.36 → 3830.60] If you're not already a member of the Float plane Club, I just dropped a link in there where you
[3830.60 → 3831.36] guys can...
[3832.26 → 3833.56] What's cool on there right now?
[3833.64 → 3836.62] Because people haven't seen my personal rig update yet, which has been on there for a
[3836.62 → 3838.42] while, but it's coming on YouTube relatively soon.
[3838.62 → 3838.78] Okay.
[3839.02 → 3841.18] So, there's a lot of stuff on there right now.
[3841.40 → 3842.20] In fact, you know what?
[3842.26 → 3845.10] An easier way to do this would be to just look at the calendar.
[3845.60 → 3849.40] So, stuff that is on Float plane Club but is not on YouTube yet.
[3849.64 → 3852.00] Backlit keyboards under 25 bucks.
[3852.10 → 3853.26] It's a 10-way roundup.
[3853.26 → 3857.50] We've got Luke's personal rig update, codename Geodude.
[3857.50 → 3858.04] Yep.
[3858.24 → 3861.24] We've got Holy Bleep, episode 15.
[3861.74 → 3864.42] The most hipster server cabinet of all time.
[3864.42 → 3865.40] It's pretty cool.
[3865.54 → 3872.12] We've got the introduction to the petabyte project where we show off the 100 drives and
[3872.12 → 3875.84] go through all of our plans for how that's going to go down.
[3875.84 → 3881.92] We've got our backplates on GPUs worth it, courtesy of Luke.
[3882.08 → 3882.26] Yeah.
[3882.36 → 3886.24] And we've got 40 gigabit networking under $100.
[3886.92 → 3890.24] So, that's everything that's in the lineup for the next week or so.
[3890.36 → 3892.80] You guys can check it all out at Float plane Club.
[3893.66 → 3897.20] And no, there's no Scrapyard Wars yet, but I will commit to this.
[3897.70 → 3901.44] We will do another season of Scrapyard Wars this year.
[3901.86 → 3903.40] Right now, we...
[3903.40 → 3903.64] What?
[3903.76 → 3904.86] That's not the hugest commitment.
[3904.86 → 3906.06] That's a commitment.
[3906.38 → 3906.62] Yeah.
[3906.88 → 3907.14] Yeah.
[3907.66 → 3908.16] We will.
[3908.56 → 3914.40] So, right now, Colton, Chelsea, and Nick are working on sponsorship for it because it
[3914.40 → 3916.46] is time-consuming and expensive.
[3917.30 → 3919.24] But we will do it.
[3919.60 → 3922.42] And thank you guys very much for watching.
[3922.56 → 3923.38] We will see you next week.
[3923.44 → 3926.30] Same bat time, same bat channel.
[3927.58 → 3928.08] Watch this.
[3928.16 → 3928.72] Watch this, Luke.
[3928.86 → 3929.34] Watch this.
[3930.20 → 3931.76] Oh, and it has audio.
[3931.98 → 3932.72] Oh, dang!
[3932.72 → 3933.16] Oh!
[3934.86 → 3938.38] Epiphany!
[3938.38 → 3938.82] Epiphany!
[3938.82 → 3939.20] Epiphany!
[3939.20 → 3959.42] Bringing you better streaming gear since whenever they were founded.
[3959.42 → 3961.32] I fix it so I can fix it.
[3962.44 → 3963.72] Even I can fix it.
