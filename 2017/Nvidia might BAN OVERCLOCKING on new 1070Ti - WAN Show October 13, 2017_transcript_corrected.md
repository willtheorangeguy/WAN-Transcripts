[0.00 → 7.00] It's a WAN Showtime! Or it was half an hour ago.
[7.00 → 10.32] Yeah. A little bit more than that, actually. 35 minutes ago.
[10.32 → 11.50] Okay. You have to tweet that out.
[11.50 → 13.00] Do you want to hear? Oh yeah, I got this. I got this.
[13.00 → 15.00] Kanpur! Kanpur! Kanpur!
[15.00 → 17.00] Ba-PUM-pum-pum-pum!
[17.00 → 19.00] Ba-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa!
[19.00 → 20.00] I don't know what we're talking about.
[20.00 → 21.00] Exciting.
[21.00 → 23.00] Um, yeah, tweets.
[23.00 → 25.00] I would have done the Wilhelm scream if I could do it.
[25.00 → 26.00] Facebook says...
[26.00 → 28.00] Uh, um, Facebook says...
[28.00 → 30.00] AAA AAAAA! No, that's not it.
[30.00 → 32.00] No, it's hard to do.
[32.00 → 34.00] Yeah, it is hard to do.
[34.00 → 37.00] Ah, no, you know what? Forget it. I'm not even going to try.
[37.00 → 39.00] It's so crazy dramatic.
[39.00 → 41.00] I know, it's fantastic.
[41.00 → 45.00] Oh, boy! Do you even want to hear the excuse today, or are we just, like, done?
[45.00 → 47.00] It happens every time.
[47.00 → 48.00] Are you just done with my excuses?
[48.00 → 49.00] Was it that?
[49.00 → 53.00] Um, the... no, no. No, that actually wasn't really anything to do with it.
[53.00 → 55.00] Okay, sure, then I want to know the excuse.
[55.00 → 60.00] Okay, so the excuse this time was that, um...
[62.00 → 63.00] Wait, what was I doing?
[63.00 → 64.00] Hold on.
[64.00 → 66.00] Oh, no, no, it was super boring.
[66.00 → 70.00] You know, one of the side effects of, like, you know that recent video we uploaded? The Dolby one?
[70.00 → 71.00] Yeah.
[71.00 → 73.00] There are a lot of comments, like, bring Luke back and stuff.
[73.00 → 74.00] Yes.
[74.00 → 77.00] One of the side effects of not showing up is everyone seems to love me.
[77.00 → 78.00] I know, right?
[78.00 → 80.00] Twitch chat is, like, all over me right now.
[80.00 → 83.00] And the comments on that video, like, a huge one of the top ones are about me.
[83.00 → 84.00] Thank you. I appreciate it.
[84.00 → 86.00] Maybe I should just never come back.
[86.00 → 87.00] You know what?
[87.00 → 89.00] And people will just love me forever until they completely forget about me.
[89.00 → 94.00] Yeah, I was going to say, that's the part that comes after that you might not be thinking about.
[94.00 → 95.00] Yeah.
[95.00 → 97.00] Maybe I'll go away for a month.
[97.00 → 98.00] Yeah, oh, God.
[98.00 → 99.00] Um...
[99.00 → 100.00] What do you think that would be like?
[100.00 → 101.00] Bad.
[101.00 → 104.00] If Linus Tech Tips just had no Linus for a month.
[104.00 → 106.00] James loves being on camera.
[106.00 → 107.00] Yeah.
[107.00 → 113.00] I think, you know, we could just have, um, we could have Brandon do, like, you know, a motherboard review.
[113.00 → 115.00] He might not have the same street cred for me.
[115.00 → 116.00] I would love that.
[116.00 → 117.00] You know what?
[117.00 → 118.00] I like Brandon's videos.
[118.00 → 119.00] I like Brandon's style.
[119.00 → 120.00] I like John's style.
[120.00 → 121.00] Yeah.
[121.00 → 123.00] I don't think John likes hosting, though.
[123.00 → 125.00] I talked to him about it today, actually.
[125.00 → 126.00] We had a chat about it.
[126.00 → 127.00] Is he warming up to it?
[127.00 → 129.00] And I, well, I don't know.
[129.00 → 135.00] I'm not going to speak for him in any way because if he wants to speak for himself, then he needs to get in front of the camera and speak for himself.
[135.00 → 136.00] Oh, my.
[136.00 → 137.00] So that's totally up to him.
[137.00 → 138.00] Oh, my.
[138.00 → 139.00] Okay.
[139.00 → 140.00] But I will say my side.
[140.00 → 142.00] My side was that I encouraged him.
[142.00 → 143.00] Yeah.
[143.00 → 144.00] I like his style, personally.
[144.00 → 146.00] I think he's a good host.
[146.00 → 150.00] I would rather watch Tech Quickie with John hosting than watch with me hosting.
[150.00 → 152.00] So, I like it.
[152.00 → 153.00] Yeah.
[153.00 → 154.00] I think he's awesome.
[154.00 → 155.00] Um...
[155.00 → 158.00] Twitch chat's freaking out about James.
[158.00 → 159.00] Someone in chat.
[159.00 → 160.00] They only love you when you're gone.
[160.00 → 161.00] Sounds like a bad country song.
[161.00 → 163.00] It sort of does.
[163.00 → 164.00] You know what?
[164.00 → 168.00] She only loves me when I'm gone.
[168.00 → 171.00] Twang, twang, twang.
[171.00 → 173.00] Twang, twang, twang.
[173.00 → 175.00] I think you can make that work.
[175.00 → 176.00] Well, okay.
[176.00 → 179.00] I don't think I've ever heard anyone vocalize that word.
[179.00 → 182.00] You know how you like air guitar?
[182.00 → 184.00] I'd be like, meh, meh, meh, meh, meh.
[184.00 → 185.00] I've never heard it.
[185.00 → 187.00] Twang, twang, twang.
[188.00 → 189.00] That's what it sounds like.
[189.00 → 191.00] I don't make the rules.
[191.00 → 196.00] I want a guitar that like isn't actually a guitar.
[196.00 → 197.00] Yeah.
[197.00 → 198.00] It has like touch sensitive strings.
[198.00 → 199.00] Sure, yeah.
[199.00 → 200.00] And then there's a speaker on the inside.
[200.00 → 201.00] Yeah.
[201.00 → 206.00] And it just goes like twang, twang, twang, twang, twang, twang, twang.
[206.00 → 207.00] That would be a great gag.
[207.00 → 211.00] That would be one of those bad auto-tune things where it's just like a flat voice recording
[211.00 → 212.00] of you saying twang.
[212.00 → 215.00] And then it's just adjusted up again.
[215.00 → 216.00] Oh, that would be great.
[216.00 → 220.00] Like the cows in Diablo 2.
[220.00 → 222.00] Is that aging myself now?
[222.00 → 223.00] Yeah.
[223.00 → 224.00] Cow level?
[224.00 → 225.00] Yeah.
[225.00 → 226.00] Yeah, a little bit.
[226.00 → 228.00] Mind you, I mean, okay, hold on.
[228.00 → 237.00] Yes, that is a cow is what the sorcerer says in Diablo 1 if you click on the cow enough
[237.00 → 238.00] times.
[238.00 → 241.00] So if you were dating yourself, then I married myself.
[241.00 → 246.00] Yes, that was all for that setup.
[246.00 → 248.00] I also played the hell out of Diablo 1.
[248.00 → 251.00] We used to play two players on one character.
[251.00 → 252.00] Yeah, okay.
[252.00 → 256.00] So like I would control like movement and attack or my buddy would do that and then the other
[256.00 → 258.00] person was on like consumables.
[258.00 → 259.00] Yep.
[259.00 → 260.00] Yeah.
[260.00 → 261.00] It's freaking awesome, dude.
[261.00 → 263.00] Oh, man.
[263.00 → 265.00] Shout out to Devin.
[265.00 → 266.00] Shout out to Devin.
[266.00 → 267.00] Yeah.
[267.00 → 269.00] Shout out to Meow Meow, I'm a cow.
[269.00 → 273.00] Alright, so we've got a lot of great topics for you guys today.
[273.00 → 275.00] Actually, we've got like nothing.
[275.00 → 276.00] Nothing happened this week.
[276.00 → 279.00] There's the scandal with OnePlus collecting user data.
[279.00 → 280.00] Ew.
[280.00 → 284.00] There's whether Apple throttles old iPhones.
[284.00 → 285.00] Ew.
[285.00 → 287.00] There's what's coming out on Float plane.
[287.00 → 288.00] Heck yeah.
[288.00 → 291.00] There's actually really cool things like Scrapyard Wars.
[291.00 → 292.00] Like Scrapyard Wars!
[292.00 → 293.00] Yeah!
[293.00 → 297.00] Actually, there are two episodes live on Float plane right now.
[297.00 → 299.00] And there will be a third.
[301.00 → 302.00] This weekend.
[302.00 → 303.00] Yeah.
[303.00 → 304.00] Yeah.
[304.00 → 305.00] There you go.
[305.00 → 308.00] Airbnb is apparently constructing an apartment building because that's what we're going to
[308.00 → 309.00] talk about.
[309.00 → 310.00] Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[310.00 → 311.00] Because there isn't a lot of other news.
[311.00 → 315.00] Yeah, I'm posting the link to where to join Float plane so that people can go watch Scrapyard Wars.
[315.00 → 316.00] Oh, wow.
[316.00 → 322.00] I was trying to post the link and then all the authentication came and hit me like a ton of bricks
[322.00 → 325.00] because that's the world we live in.
[325.00 → 326.00] Yep.
[326.00 → 328.00] You have to have all of those things.
[328.00 → 333.00] You have to have all the passwords and all the authentications and all the, oh, I entered it wrong
[333.00 → 335.00] and all the this could take...
[335.00 → 337.00] And I got it.
[337.00 → 338.00] You know how tempted I was?
[338.00 → 339.00] It's cool.
[339.00 → 340.00] I just entered it wrong again.
[340.00 → 341.00] I swear, the last past...
[341.00 → 342.00] I mean, it's in the chat now.
[342.00 → 351.00] I swear, the last past text entry field, I swear it doesn't take characters in order sometimes.
[351.00 → 353.00] Because it's like, you know how it's kind of laggy in general?
[353.00 → 356.00] Like it takes a long time to open it, and sometimes they take a while to appear.
[356.00 → 364.00] Like I swear, there are times when I enter it right and it just doesn't take it.
[364.00 → 365.00] Tell me something.
[365.00 → 368.00] Okay, you're more of a security guy than me.
[368.00 → 369.00] Okay.
[369.00 → 370.00] Tell me something.
[370.00 → 371.00] Yeah.
[371.00 → 381.00] Would it be a reasonable and or effective security measure for them to occasionally reject the correct password?
[381.00 → 384.00] And just make you type it again.
[384.00 → 386.00] I don't really think so.
[386.00 → 387.00] Well, okay.
[387.00 → 389.00] So let's say someone was using a dictionary attack.
[389.00 → 391.00] Would a dictionary attack ever try the same thing twice?
[391.00 → 392.00] But then it only does it occasionally.
[392.00 → 393.00] Well, no.
[393.00 → 399.00] Okay, let's say if it, let's say every time it was from a new IP or a new device, it would actually just like, not work.
[399.00 → 400.00] Because...
[400.00 → 404.00] But then people doing that dictionary attack would know that.
[404.00 → 405.00] Why?
[405.00 → 406.00] Why wouldn't they?
[406.00 → 408.00] If it just said invalid password?
[408.00 → 410.00] I'm pretty sure people would figure it out.
[410.00 → 411.00] You think so?
[411.00 → 413.00] That it's like auto-rejecting correct passwords.
[413.00 → 416.00] I'm pretty sure that would be like posted somewhere pretty quickly.
[416.00 → 417.00] Okay.
[417.00 → 420.00] I feel like that's figure-out-able.
[420.00 → 421.00] Okay.
[421.00 → 422.00] I was just curious.
[422.00 → 423.00] I'm just...
[423.00 → 424.00] A discoverable tactic.
[424.00 → 426.00] I don't think it would be super effective.
[426.00 → 428.00] So it would be like...
[428.00 → 430.00] I think having extra layers...
[430.00 → 431.00] So it would be kind of like...
[431.00 → 432.00] It's super effective!
[432.00 → 433.00] Hold on, hold on.
[433.00 → 435.00] Water on plant is like...
[435.00 → 437.00] It's like kind of effective.
[437.00 → 438.00] Water on plant.
[438.00 → 439.00] Yeah.
[439.00 → 440.00] I can't remember the rules.
[440.00 → 442.00] I don't think it did very much.
[442.00 → 444.00] I thought that was like weaker, wasn't it?
[444.00 → 445.00] Yeah, yeah.
[445.00 → 446.00] But like it works though.
[446.00 → 447.00] It's not like using...
[447.00 → 450.00] Oh, it's not electric against rock.
[450.00 → 451.00] Yeah.
[451.00 → 452.00] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[452.00 → 453.00] I don't remember what that's actually...
[453.00 → 456.00] I don't remember what the exact phrase that they say is.
[456.00 → 457.00] Oh no.
[457.00 → 458.00] Oh no.
[458.00 → 459.00] Heavens.
[459.00 → 460.00] There's a Twitch beta.
[460.00 → 461.00] That was me, not you.
[461.00 → 462.00] Twitch beta.
[462.00 → 463.00] Do I continue to beta?
[463.00 → 464.00] Oh man.
[464.00 → 469.00] I feel like my whole life is about continuing to beta.
[469.00 → 470.00] Wow.
[470.00 → 472.00] Will I ever be an alpha?
[472.00 → 473.00] Ever?
[473.00 → 475.00] I think you have alpha traits.
[475.00 → 476.00] Alpha traits?
[476.00 → 477.00] Yeah.
[477.00 → 478.00] Thank you.
[478.00 → 479.00] Well, that's appreciated.
[479.00 → 480.00] You're a leader.
[480.00 → 481.00] You run a company.
[481.00 → 484.00] Yeah, but I run like a tech YouTube company.
[484.00 → 485.00] But you still run a company.
[485.00 → 486.00] Okay, that's true.
[486.00 → 487.00] You started it.
[487.00 → 489.00] You took the risk to start the company.
[489.00 → 490.00] Mm-hmm.
[490.00 → 491.00] I don't think that's...
[491.00 → 494.00] If someone ran at you with a bat, you're suddenly not alpha anymore.
[494.00 → 495.00] Yeah, I think if...
[495.00 → 499.00] But outside of that, outside physical confrontation, I think you're quite...
[499.00 → 500.00] Oh, thank you.
[500.00 → 501.00] I mean, if we're...
[501.00 → 508.00] Okay, if we're going all the way back to like, you know, the primal, you know, alpha beta
[508.00 → 510.00] designations for people, then like...
[510.00 → 512.00] But there are alpha traits that are social.
[512.00 → 515.00] Doesn't the stick, like, pretty much summarize it?
[515.00 → 516.00] Isn't that the whole point?
[516.00 → 519.00] But there are alpha traits that are social.
[519.00 → 520.00] Ah, alright.
[520.00 → 521.00] And I think you do quite well in that regard.
[521.00 → 522.00] I appreciate that.
[522.00 → 523.00] That's very nice.
[523.00 → 524.00] No problem.
[524.00 → 525.00] Oh, man.
[525.00 → 527.00] What else do we have for topics today?
[527.00 → 528.00] Uh...
[528.00 → 529.00] Uh...
[529.00 → 530.00] Intro!
[530.00 → 531.00] Yeah!
[531.00 → 532.00] Wow.
[537.00 → 538.00] It's rumoured?
[538.00 → 539.00] It's just a rumour?
[539.00 → 541.00] That's an interesting discussion, though.
[541.00 → 542.00] Yeah.
[542.00 → 543.00] If nothing else.
[543.00 → 546.00] Apparently I'm a master beta.
[547.00 → 548.00] Which...
[548.00 → 549.00] Sounds amazing.
[550.00 → 552.00] I want to be a master beta all day.
[555.00 → 556.00] Ed laughed.
[556.00 → 557.00] Yep.
[557.00 → 558.00] We got Ed.
[558.00 → 561.00] So even if no one in the audience liked it, then uh...
[561.00 → 562.00] Where'd they, uh...
[562.00 → 563.00] Where'd that comment go?
[563.00 → 564.00] I don't know.
[564.00 → 565.00] It moves too fast.
[565.00 → 567.00] There's all our sponsors and stuff.
[567.00 → 568.00] Alright.
[568.00 → 573.00] So, let's get this poop show on the road.
[573.00 → 577.00] So this was originally posted by Juz2B on the forum.
[577.00 → 583.00] And the original article here is from chrisdcmoore.co.uk.
[583.00 → 584.00] Wow.
[584.00 → 586.00] And in a nutshell...
[586.00 → 587.00] Um...
[587.00 → 590.00] Posting this in the chat, by the way.
[590.00 → 591.00] Okay.
[591.00 → 598.00] There is a way to remove the OnePlus device manager app via ADB without requiring root.
[598.00 → 604.00] But up until that happened, there was an ongoing scandal this week that, um...
[604.00 → 606.00] Was started...
[606.00 → 609.00] From Chris's security and tech blog.
[609.00 → 616.00] Finding out that OnePlus is actually collecting a lot of user data tied to the phone's serial number.
[616.00 → 617.00] So...
[617.00 → 629.00] Collecting user data anonymously means that you are collecting the user data without any additional information that could allow it to be tied directly to the user.
[629.00 → 638.00] So, an example might be if Luke and I both opted in to an anonymous data collection schema through our device or our computer or whatever.
[638.00 → 639.00] Which I do for some things.
[639.00 → 640.00] Which I do for some things too.
[640.00 → 641.00] And not others.
[641.00 → 642.00] Um...
[642.00 → 643.00] Let's say that we did.
[643.00 → 644.00] Or GeForce Experience.
[644.00 → 645.00] I don't for that.
[645.00 → 646.00] Yeah, and I don't either.
[646.00 → 647.00] Okay.
[647.00 → 648.00] Um...
[648.00 → 649.00] I don't have GeForce.
[649.00 → 650.00] I used to like GeForce Experience.
[650.00 → 651.00] It was nice.
[651.00 → 656.00] The idea is that if Luke had Chrome on his phone...
[656.00 → 657.00] Yeah.
[657.00 → 659.00] And I had Chrome on my phone...
[659.00 → 667.00] This company would take that information that two users have Chrome installed and then maybe they would look at a bunch of other users and figure out that...
[667.00 → 671.00] 70% of their users are installing Google Chrome.
[671.00 → 674.00] That is anonymous data.
[674.00 → 677.00] It's still useful, and it's still valuable.
[677.00 → 678.00] That's still...
[678.00 → 682.00] There's even some stuff where it might be like two users from British Columbia, Canada.
[682.00 → 683.00] Yes.
[683.00 → 685.00] But it's not enough to tag down to you.
[685.00 → 688.00] It's not like two users from these home addresses.
[688.00 → 689.00] Yes.
[689.00 → 692.00] It's two users from this geo.
[692.00 → 693.00] Exactly.
[693.00 → 708.00] So once they tie it to a serial number, feasibly, they could tie it, especially since OnePlus sells through their own store, they could tie it to a name, an address, a credit card, everything.
[708.00 → 709.00] Yeah.
[709.00 → 714.00] If there's ever a criminal investigation where they seize property, they could get the phone, get the serial number, and then get all the data that way.
[714.00 → 718.00] So this happens when the phone screen is locked or unlocked.
[718.00 → 725.00] The phone's IMEI, phone numbers, MAC addresses, mobile network names, and IMSI prefixes, as well as the...
[725.00 → 726.00] Wow.
[726.00 → 727.00] Wireless network, SSIDs.
[727.00 → 728.00] Wow.
[728.00 → 734.00] Timestamp ranges of when and which applications on the phone are opened and closed.
[734.00 → 739.00] Timestamps of which activities were fired up in which applications.
[739.00 → 745.00] And so the code responsible for this data collection is part of the OnePlus device manager.
[745.00 → 748.00] That's enough for me to literally never have a OnePlus device ever.
[750.00 → 751.00] So, again...
[751.00 → 753.00] Like, if verified true, which...
[753.00 → 754.00] All the...
[754.00 → 755.00] Yeah, look, this is a thing.
[755.00 → 757.00] Yeah, no one seems to be going against it.
[757.00 → 762.00] All of this is fine if it's anonymized.
[762.00 → 765.00] So it cannot contain the IMEI.
[765.00 → 766.00] Okay?
[766.00 → 768.00] It can't contain the phone number.
[768.00 → 770.00] When I say all of this is okay if it's anonymized, I mean...
[770.00 → 771.00] Yeah.
[771.00 → 772.00] I mean all the things...
[772.00 → 773.00] Actually, no, most of this is just straight up not okay.
[773.00 → 774.00] It's not okay.
[774.00 → 775.00] Yeah.
[775.00 → 776.00] Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[776.00 → 781.00] Um, when applications on the phone are opened and closed and what people do in them, if you
[781.00 → 783.00] agree to a program that collects that data...
[783.00 → 784.00] And what people do in them.
[784.00 → 786.00] If it's not...
[786.00 → 790.00] If it's anonymized, if it's truly anonymized, then okay.
[790.00 → 791.00] Yeah.
[791.00 → 792.00] Yeah.
[792.00 → 793.00] Yeah.
[793.00 → 796.00] If it's not clear information that ties it to a person, then this is like terrible.
[796.00 → 797.00] And they still have to ask.
[797.00 → 798.00] Yes.
[798.00 → 799.00] And you still have to ask.
[799.00 → 800.00] And they didn't ask.
[800.00 → 802.00] So none of it's okay.
[802.00 → 803.00] So...
[803.00 → 809.34] So you're like, hey, in this app, when you're signing up, here's a checkbox specifically
[809.34 → 813.64] that outside of the terms of service asks its own specific question, which is, can we
[813.64 → 815.00] harvest anonymous user data?
[815.00 → 816.14] And you're like, yes.
[816.14 → 818.82] And then they're like, hmm, okay.
[818.82 → 822.62] This user seems to click on this area of the screen a lot.
[822.62 → 824.24] Let's compare that against all the other users.
[824.24 → 827.48] Okay, all the users seem to click on this area of the screen a lot.
[827.48 → 830.00] Let's put more important things up here.
[830.00 → 831.64] Because they seem to be focused up there.
[831.64 → 834.14] That's like a common use case for things.
[834.14 → 835.14] That's fine.
[835.14 → 840.18] Taking my wireless network IDs and when I open apps so you can sell me crap and track
[840.18 → 842.24] my movement is not fine.
[842.24 → 843.24] Wow.
[843.24 → 846.24] We'll never personally use a OnePlus device.
[846.24 → 847.24] Huh.
[847.24 → 848.24] How about that?
[848.24 → 849.24] Screw that noise.
[849.24 → 850.24] That's wonderful.
[850.24 → 851.24] So, okay.
[851.24 → 856.24] The good news if you already have a OnePlus device is that you can remove it.
[856.24 → 858.18] So here we go.
[858.18 → 859.32] Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[859.32 → 866.32] So the Twitter user, Jacob Zachary.
[866.32 → 867.32] Ah.
[867.32 → 868.32] Uh.
[868.32 → 870.10] Back to the screen share.
[870.10 → 871.10] This guy.
[871.10 → 873.10] There we go.
[873.10 → 875.70] I'm assuming you did a pretty okay job.
[875.70 → 876.44] So there you go.
[876.44 → 880.58] This is the command to disable OnePlus's analytics permanently.
[880.58 → 881.78] So there you go.
[881.78 → 883.00] Go check that out.
[883.00 → 884.96] It's over on ChrisDCmore.co.uk.
[884.96 → 886.96] That's something that the average user can do.
[886.96 → 889.96] I very appreciate that Jacob did this.
[889.96 → 890.96] It's better than nothing.
[890.96 → 891.96] That's awesome.
[891.96 → 894.96] My same response to, uh, what was it?
[894.96 → 896.96] On that weird watch thing that I did.
[896.96 → 898.96] The Mid armband thing?
[898.96 → 899.96] No, no.
[899.96 → 900.96] That was cool.
[900.96 → 901.96] The one that I hated.
[901.96 → 902.96] The kick farted one.
[902.96 → 903.96] Oh, the Neptune Pine.
[903.96 → 908.96] First, Neptune Pine was one of the spy devices in the most recent Fast and the Furious.
[908.96 → 910.96] Was it really?
[910.96 → 912.96] Yeah, I was watching it with MADE.
[912.96 → 914.96] And then MADE and I at the same time are like, what?
[914.96 → 916.96] Because he has it, and he's like doing crazy spy stuff on it.
[916.96 → 918.96] Are they just using it as like a prop?
[918.96 → 919.96] Yeah.
[919.96 → 920.96] Like surely they didn't pick it up.
[920.96 → 921.96] I'm pretty sure it's like green screened or something.
[921.96 → 924.96] Like it's, it's not, it's, there's no, it, there's no branding anywhere.
[924.96 → 927.96] But it's a Neptune Pine, you're sure?
[927.96 → 929.96] Yeah, I'm 100% sure.
[929.96 → 931.96] Neptune Pine, Fast and the Furious, yeah.
[931.96 → 934.96] I, I, I doubt anyone else even noticed.
[934.96 → 935.96] Like.
[935.96 → 936.96] Boom.
[936.96 → 937.96] Is that it right there?
[937.96 → 940.96] Hold on.
[940.96 → 942.96] That's it on his wrist.
[942.96 → 943.96] Is that it?
[943.96 → 947.96] There's better, yeah, there are better moments of it.
[947.96 → 949.96] But it's definitely that.
[949.96 → 950.96] Let me see if I can find it.
[953.96 → 954.96] Huh.
[954.96 → 960.96] I mean, I guess, yeah, that like, like going and getting some stupid obscure device is probably
[960.96 → 962.96] better than creating a pop from scratch.
[962.96 → 963.96] And it has like a big screen on it and stuff.
[963.96 → 964.96] Yeah.
[964.96 → 967.96] I got a bunch of tweets right after the movie came out.
[967.96 → 968.96] Huh.
[968.96 → 969.96] Yeah, I can't find a good picture of it.
[969.96 → 971.96] But wow, that's crazy.
[971.96 → 973.96] Um, what was I talking about?
[973.96 → 975.96] I don't remember.
[975.96 → 976.96] Okay.
[976.96 → 977.96] Anyway.
[977.96 → 980.96] Um, wow.
[980.96 → 982.96] I super don't remember.
[982.96 → 983.96] Me neither.
[983.96 → 984.96] Okay.
[984.96 → 985.96] I'm totally engrossed in this being on.
[985.96 → 987.96] I'm baffled about.
[987.96 → 988.96] I'm tired.
[988.96 → 989.96] Why was this week so tiring?
[989.96 → 991.96] We had a day off.
[991.96 → 996.96] I'm baffled about Neptune pine smartwatch playing an integral part of Fast and Furious 8.
[996.96 → 997.96] I have to confess.
[997.96 → 1000.96] I have never seen a Fast and Furious movie.
[1000.96 → 1001.96] Not one?
[1001.96 → 1002.96] No.
[1002.96 → 1004.96] Or two or three or-
[1004.96 → 1005.96] I didn't mean-
[1005.96 → 1006.96] I-
[1006.96 → 1007.96] I-
[1007.96 → 1009.96] So I-
[1009.96 → 1015.96] I like them, but in the sense of like, yeah, that was entertainingly stupid.
[1015.96 → 1020.96] But not in the quality, entertainingly stupid way that like Kinsman is.
[1020.96 → 1021.96] Okay.
[1021.96 → 1024.96] In the just more stupid.
[1024.96 → 1026.96] How did Kinsman have a 50-
[1026.96 → 1029.96] Kinsman 2 have a 50% rating on Rotten Tomatoes?
[1029.96 → 1030.96] Okay.
[1030.96 → 1031.96] We went on a date last week.
[1031.96 → 1032.96] Yeah.
[1032.96 → 1033.96] Um, we went out on Friday night.
[1033.96 → 1035.96] We went to see Kinsman, the Golden Circle.
[1035.96 → 1036.96] And then had milkshake.
[1036.96 → 1039.96] And both of us were laughing out like-
[1039.96 → 1041.96] I very rarely laugh out loud in the theatre.
[1041.96 → 1042.96] It was so good.
[1042.96 → 1044.96] It was so good.
[1044.96 → 1048.96] And you should-you don't have to enjoy it, but you should absolutely watch the first one first.
[1048.96 → 1049.96] Yes.
[1049.96 → 1050.96] Yes.
[1050.96 → 1051.96] You don't have to at all.
[1051.96 → 1057.96] You totally don't have to, but it would be kind of a drag to watch the first one after knowing the plot of the second one.
[1057.96 → 1058.96] Yeah.
[1058.96 → 1061.96] So, yeah, we're- don't worry, no spoilers or anything.
[1061.96 → 1063.96] But like, it was awesome.
[1063.96 → 1066.96] If you have a sense of humour, then go see it.
[1066.96 → 1067.96] It's so good.
[1067.96 → 1071.96] Prepare to turn your brain off for a couple of hours because it's fine, but it's like-
[1071.96 → 1076.96] I- okay, I- my- my family was asking me what it was.
[1076.96 → 1083.96] And I was like, its James Bond crossed with 60s Batman.
[1083.96 → 1085.96] Kind of.
[1085.96 → 1092.96] Not like perfectly, but that's probably- because I have a really hard time explaining it as well.
[1092.96 → 1093.96] Yeah.
[1093.96 → 1094.96] That's a pretty good way to do it.
[1094.96 → 1095.96] Yeah.
[1095.96 → 1097.96] It misses some of the like raunchy side of things.
[1097.96 → 1098.96] Yeah, yeah.
[1098.96 → 1099.96] But, yeah, yeah.
[1099.96 → 1102.96] But it's just-it's- it's- it's- it's- yeah.
[1102.96 → 1103.96] Yeah.
[1103.96 → 1106.96] It's pure fun, but like with better production values and slicker.
[1106.96 → 1107.96] Yeah, yeah.
[1107.96 → 1111.96] And the acting, honestly, for what they are trying to do- Yeah.
[1111.96 → 1112.96] Is perfect.
[1112.96 → 1115.96] They found guys that can keep straight faces pretty well and stuff.
[1115.96 → 1119.96] Um, by the way, I remember the thing I was trying to talk about.
[1119.96 → 1130.96] When I did my Neptune Pine review, if you guys remember that, I brought up something called Neptune Ninja, which was this website that was all based around like how to kind of break it so that it would work better.
[1130.96 → 1138.96] Um, and it was super cool, and I commended the guys that made that site because it was honestly quite awesome, and it made the Neptune Pine a lot better.
[1138.96 → 1140.96] But it shouldn't need to exist.
[1140.96 → 1141.96] Right.
[1141.96 → 1143.96] And that's something that I said in the review too.
[1143.96 → 1153.96] Like, I'm happy that these dudes came together and made this device so much better so that people that bought it would actually have like an experience that was still not good, but better than what they were given.
[1153.96 → 1154.96] Slightly less horrible.
[1154.96 → 1155.96] Yeah.
[1155.96 → 1156.96] So like, that's cool.
[1156.96 → 1159.96] So all the Neptune Ninja guys, like, great, good work.
[1159.96 → 1164.96] Um, but really you shouldn't have had to do that.
[1164.96 → 1168.96] So like that bit of code to remove the thing, that's great.
[1168.96 → 1170.96] I'm very happy the guy posted there.
[1170.96 → 1171.96] That's really great.
[1171.96 → 1172.96] You're helping a lot of people.
[1172.96 → 1173.96] That's very good.
[1173.96 → 1175.96] I don't think that you should have had to do that.
[1175.96 → 1176.96] Yeah.
[1176.96 → 1178.96] So I wasn't digging on him.
[1178.96 → 1179.96] All right.
[1179.96 → 1180.96] So this is fun.
[1180.96 → 1182.96] Um, sorry, I'm good.
[1182.96 → 1184.96] Uh, a story about-
[1184.96 → 1196.96] Man, this says last week a story went viral that claimed Apple was intentionally slowing down older iPhones to push people to buy its latest models.
[1196.96 → 1198.96] I mean, you could replace last week-
[1198.96 → 1199.96] With any week in history.
[1199.96 → 1200.96] With any period in time.
[1200.96 → 1201.96] Yeah.
[1201.96 → 1203.96] Any period in the last eight years.
[1203.96 → 1204.96] Yeah.
[1204.96 → 1205.96] There you go.
[1205.96 → 1218.96] Um, and this claim, this particular claim was based on data which shows that Google searches for iPhone slow spike dramatically with the release of each new model.
[1218.96 → 1228.96] Fortunately, Future Mark has heaps of data from seven different iPhone models across three different versions of iOS.
[1228.96 → 1232.96] And as for the results, well, let's go ahead and bring it up.
[1232.96 → 1235.96] This was originally posted by Hey Yo on the forum.
[1235.96 → 1238.96] And, uh, here we go.
[1238.96 → 1246.96] Here's the Apple iPhone 5s CPU performance, uh, from April 2016 to September 2017.
[1246.96 → 1250.96] That is a flat-ass line.
[1250.96 → 1253.96] There are some dips, there are some raises, but it's pretty flat.
[1253.96 → 1254.96] Here's the GPU performance.
[1254.96 → 1255.96] That gets better.
[1255.96 → 1256.96] Mm-hmm.
[1256.96 → 1259.96] About as better as you'd expect from GPU driver revisions.
[1259.96 → 1261.96] Here's the iPhone 6.
[1261.96 → 1266.96] So CPU performance did go down a bit, but GPU performance went up.
[1266.96 → 1267.96] Like a fair chunk, actually.
[1267.96 → 1269.96] Like a pretty good amount.
[1269.96 → 1270.96] Uh, the 6s.
[1270.96 → 1272.96] Okay, so it comes and goes.
[1272.96 → 1274.96] It's doing okay now.
[1274.96 → 1276.96] A little worse for the wear than when it was released.
[1276.96 → 1280.96] With the 6s being a little bit slower on CPU now as well.
[1280.96 → 1284.96] And as for the 7, well, it's holding about as steady as any of the other ones.
[1284.96 → 1288.96] So if the theory is that, um, okay, so here we go.
[1288.96 → 1292.96] Our benchmarking data shows that rather than intentionally degrading the performance of older models,
[1292.96 → 1296.96] Apple actually does a good job of supporting its older devices with regular updates
[1296.96 → 1301.96] that maintain a consistent level of performance across iOS versions, says Future Mark.
[1301.96 → 1305.96] Because remember guys, even though we do see that CPU performance go down a little bit,
[1305.96 → 1308.96] you have to remember that new versions of iOS do new stuff.
[1308.96 → 1310.96] And have new services running.
[1310.96 → 1316.96] Uh, the fact that you still have enough leftover cycles in order to get a very similar score on a benchmark
[1316.96 → 1318.96] is actually pretty good.
[1318.96 → 1325.96] Now, with that said, it's not like I don't think that in particular
[1325.96 → 1332.96] UI responsiveness couldn't stay better than it does.
[1332.96 → 1335.96] But there are other factors at play here too.
[1335.96 → 1337.96] And it's hard to benchmark UI responsiveness.
[1337.96 → 1339.96] It's very difficult to benchmark that.
[1339.96 → 1341.96] Um, and there are other factors at play here too.
[1341.96 → 1346.96] Like for example, this is something a lot of people don't necessarily, even if they know it,
[1346.96 → 1349.96] they don't necessarily think about it in the context of their phone.
[1349.96 → 1355.96] But NAND flash, the storage that's used for every phone.
[1355.96 → 1358.96] I can't think of a, I've tried to think if there's a phone with a hard drive in it.
[1358.96 → 1360.96] Like they had hard driven based iPods.
[1360.96 → 1361.96] I was like, oh, hold on a second.
[1361.96 → 1365.96] Did anyone do a phone with a like, 1.8-inch hard drive in it?
[1365.96 → 1367.96] Anyway, I can't think of one.
[1367.96 → 1373.96] But, but people don't necessarily realize that even though SSDs have no moving parts,
[1373.96 → 1376.96] their performance does degrade over time.
[1376.96 → 1381.96] Especially if they spend a lot of their life at or near their full capacity.
[1381.96 → 1386.96] So you may actually notice things like app loading times degrade.
[1386.96 → 1391.96] And this could be due to retired blocks in your NAND flash.
[1391.96 → 1393.96] And the controller having to work around that.
[1393.96 → 1395.96] It could be due to your phone being quite full.
[1395.96 → 1399.96] It could be due to just typical OS bloat.
[1399.96 → 1403.96] Which happens with every device pretty much across the board.
[1403.96 → 1406.96] It's something I don't actually quite understand that well.
[1406.96 → 1412.96] Like, why is it that a few text entries in the Windows registry means that my computer is slow, slower now?
[1412.96 → 1414.96] This doesn't quite compute for me.
[1414.96 → 1415.96] It's a little bit more complicated than that.
[1415.96 → 1416.96] I'm sure it is.
[1416.96 → 1420.96] But, I mean, this, okay, this is another me being an ignorant moron.
[1420.96 → 1422.96] But maybe you can explain this one to me too.
[1422.96 → 1424.96] Why is it that when I take a ancient game?
[1424.96 → 1425.96] Okay.
[1425.96 → 1428.96] So 1602 AD is the example that I haven't looked at in like five years.
[1428.96 → 1429.96] Okay, so I know where you're going with this.
[1429.96 → 1432.96] This is where, like, a lot of times it's timed out.
[1432.96 → 1435.96] Yeah.
[1435.96 → 1441.96] Or, like, a certain application is not necessarily timed out, but can only access a certain amount of resources.
[1441.96 → 1448.96] So because that application can only use so much, it doesn't matter that you have much more hardware.
[1448.96 → 1449.96] Okay.
[1449.96 → 1450.96] Okay.
[1450.96 → 1456.96] So what I was going with this was that that particular game, if you have it on an ISO, it's a CD, okay?
[1456.96 → 1459.96] So it's like 605 legs or whatever a CD is.
[1459.96 → 1471.96] If you have it on an ISO, on an NVMe SSD, and you install that game on a modern processor, I think the minimum requirements for it are like 90 megahertz P1 or something like that.
[1471.96 → 1473.96] Maybe 200 megahertz Pentium 1.
[1473.96 → 1477.96] It still takes like 10, 15 minutes to install.
[1477.96 → 1486.96] And I'm kind of sitting here going, we could have unpacked at the highest compression level 600 legs of data over and over and over again in this time.
[1486.96 → 1489.96] We could have rewritten our entire registry in this time.
[1489.96 → 1497.96] And we could have transferred 600 legs back and forth literally hundreds of times in this time.
[1497.96 → 1499.96] What are you working on?
[1499.96 → 1501.96] I don't know like every-
[1501.96 → 1502.96] It makes me mad.
[1502.96 → 1503.96] I'm sure there's people in the Twitch chat.
[1503.96 → 1505.96] I'm sure there's people in the archive that'll know better than me.
[1505.96 → 1507.96] So please post in the comments.
[1507.96 → 1508.96] Yeah, feel free.
[1508.96 → 1512.96] But as far as I know, it's timing stuff.
[1512.96 → 1516.96] Some things are set up to go after a certain amount of time.
[1516.96 → 1517.96] Some things are set up to take a certain amount of time.
[1517.96 → 1520.96] Some things are only able to use so much performance.
[1520.96 → 1524.96] I pretty much guarantee you all of that is single threaded.
[1524.96 → 1527.96] It's middle out compression.
[1529.96 → 1532.96] No, that was-hold on, who said this?
[1532.96 → 1533.96] It seems very credible.
[1533.96 → 1534.96] Chicken fried butt says that.
[1534.96 → 1535.96] Credible name.
[1535.96 → 1536.96] Chicken fried butt.
[1536.96 → 1538.96] Credible name, middle out compression.
[1538.96 → 1539.96] You know what?
[1539.96 → 1541.96] I don't know why I didn't think of that.
[1541.96 → 1543.96] It's so obvious now.
[1543.96 → 1547.96] Someone corrected me.
[1547.96 → 1548.96] Anno1602.
[1548.96 → 1550.96] Yes, that is what it was called in other territories.
[1550.96 → 1551.96] It was called 1602 AD here.
[1551.96 → 1553.96] Speaking of someone correcting me, I screwed up pretty bad earlier in the show.
[1553.96 → 1554.96] Oh, what did you do?
[1554.96 → 1558.96] I said electric doesn't work against rock.
[1558.96 → 1560.96] It's electric doesn't work against ground.
[1560.96 → 1566.96] So it would work on a Geodude but not on a Diglett!
[1566.96 → 1567.96] You suck!
[1567.96 → 1568.96] Yeah.
[1568.96 → 1569.96] You suck so much.
[1569.96 → 1571.96] Wow, that's embarrassing for you.
[1571.96 → 1572.96] It sort of is.
[1572.96 → 1573.96] Wow!
[1573.96 → 1574.96] Yeah, it's pretty bad.
[1574.96 → 1576.96] I don't think I got any of it wrong even.
[1576.96 → 1577.96] No, I don't think so.
[1577.96 → 1579.96] Wow, I haven't touched Pokémon in like 10 years.
[1579.96 → 1580.96] You know that, right?
[1580.96 → 1581.96] Yeah.
[1581.96 → 1583.96] I see you, you're like, you're distressed dude.
[1583.96 → 1584.96] Yeah, no, I screwed up.
[1584.96 → 1585.96] And I'm not helping at all.
[1585.96 → 1586.96] Oh no.
[1586.96 → 1589.96] I'm like low-key rubbing it in right now.
[1589.96 → 1590.96] Yeah, that hurts.
[1590.96 → 1591.96] Wow, that sucks man.
[1591.96 → 1592.96] Yeah, that's pretty bad.
[1592.96 → 1593.96] Wow!
[1593.96 → 1595.96] Because you're like, you're like a Pokémon guy!
[1595.96 → 1597.96] To be fair, I don't use electric very much.
[1597.96 → 1598.96] Oh wow!
[1598.96 → 1600.96] But I still, I use...
[1600.96 → 1603.96] Oh, apparently Geodude is ground rock.
[1603.96 → 1605.96] I was, well, yeah.
[1605.96 → 1608.96] And I run Graveless and Geodude a lot.
[1608.96 → 1611.96] So, I knew that bit, but like...
[1611.96 → 1613.96] The day the alcoholism started.
[1613.96 → 1614.96] Pretty much.
[1614.96 → 1617.96] Just going to go home and get smashed and play Shadow of War.
[1617.96 → 1618.96] Yeah, alright.
[1618.96 → 1622.96] Cry about loot crates, cry about forgetting Pokémon stuff.
[1622.96 → 1624.96] Oh, I had too much fun with that.
[1624.96 → 1626.96] Speaking of having too much fun...
[1626.96 → 1628.96] Want to create a website?

[1651.96 → 1654.96] The easy direction was going to be about all the fun you're having,
[1654.96 → 1655.96] but I was like, no.
[1655.96 → 1658.96] This is going to be about roasting me about Pokémon.
[1658.96 → 1660.96] And you have to send it to him on Twitter.

[1713.96 → 1714.96] Oh my goodness.
[1714.96 → 1715.96] Oh, that was too much fun.
[1715.96 → 1716.96] I think for that, you have to eat the spicy jerky.
[1716.96 → 1720.96] I, I am going to eat the spicy jerky.
[1720.96 → 1724.96] But first, I am going to put on this shirt from Mack Weldon.
[1724.96 → 1725.96] This shirt is also from Mack Weldon.
[1725.96 → 1726.96] Oh dang it.
[1726.96 → 1727.96] It's just already on because I have to do this.
[1727.96 → 1728.96] Why did Colton tell you to do this?
[1728.96 → 1729.96] Oh, they sent new stuff.
[1729.96 → 1730.96] Yeah.
[1730.96 → 1731.96] Oh, it's a long sleeve.
[1731.96 → 1732.96] I love these.
[1732.96 → 1733.96] Cool.
[1733.96 → 1734.96] So, Mack Weldon.
[1734.96 → 1747.96] The online store that believes in smart design, premium fabrics, and simple shopping.
[1747.96 → 1753.96] It's like super easy because you don't even have to wear underwear to buy underwear.
[1753.96 → 1754.96] Yes, my friends.
[1754.96 → 1757.96] Mack Weldon clothing is super comfortable and...
[1757.96 → 1759.96] Did we nip slip?
[1759.96 → 1760.96] What?
[1760.96 → 1763.96] Look how professional this show looks when we have a collar.
[1763.96 → 1764.96] Wow.
[1764.96 → 1765.96] Like, seriously.
[1765.96 → 1768.96] How much does that step up the WAN show's game?
[1768.96 → 1770.96] Quite a bit, but you have to get these up.
[1770.96 → 1771.96] Right?
[1771.96 → 1772.96] Because you're flaring.
[1772.96 → 1773.96] So you have to roll up and then resin.
[1773.96 → 1774.96] Right.
[1774.96 → 1776.96] Yeah, see, I don't know these things, man.
[1776.96 → 1780.96] Okay, I'll work on that in the meantime, but like, how pro does that look?
[1780.96 → 1781.96] Wow.
[1781.96 → 1783.96] How, what direction has my life gone?
[1783.96 → 1785.96] I knew that, but not the Pokémon thing.
[1785.96 → 1787.96] Wow!
[1787.96 → 1788.96] Oh!
[1788.96 → 1789.96] Oh!
[1789.96 → 1792.96] Previous versions of me would be so disappointed right now!
[1792.96 → 1794.96] It's time to take a step back and re-evaluate, Luke.
[1794.96 → 1795.96] Oh, God!
[1795.96 → 1798.96] No, see, with this one, you just go like this.
[1798.96 → 1804.96] Oh, I can't pin it, because your forearms are way too jacked.
[1804.96 → 1805.96] Okay, that makes sense.
[1805.96 → 1806.96] Keep doing your thing, then.
[1806.96 → 1810.96] But you just go like that, but then you have like monster forearms, so it doesn't actually...
[1810.96 → 1813.96] Well, it's not even monster, it's just relative to my wrists.
[1813.96 → 1814.96] Yeah.
[1814.96 → 1815.96] Yeah.
[1815.96 → 1819.96] So I have like these skinny wrists, and then, like that's, there, okay, I'll, there, that's
[1819.96 → 1820.96] flexed.
[1820.96 → 1821.96] And it's like...
[1822.96 → 1823.96] Badminton!
[1823.96 → 1825.96] That's badminton for you.
[1825.96 → 1826.96] Yeah, yeah.
[1826.96 → 1829.96] Um, you know what, I'll just, I'll give up on that.
[1829.96 → 1830.96] Yeah, no, it's fine.
[1830.96 → 1834.96] No amount of putting good clothing on me is going to make me knowledgeable.
[1834.96 → 1841.96] But what I do know about is their silver line of underwear that is awesome, because it has
[1841.96 → 1845.96] silver in it, which is naturally antimicrobial, and that's where the smell from your clothing
[1845.96 → 1846.96] comes from.
[1846.96 → 1848.96] I'm not saying you never have to wash it.
[1848.96 → 1850.96] Mack Weldon isn't saying you never have to wash it.
[1850.96 → 1852.96] Definitely no one is saying that.
[1852.96 → 1857.96] But the silver in the clothing will help to fight odours.
[1857.96 → 1862.96] So head over to MackWeldon.com and get 20% off using offer code TECHNICS.
[1862.96 → 1865.96] Um, oh, apparently we've got a link here.
[1865.96 → 1871.96] It's genie.us slash DV, big g, big y, big i, you know what, why don't I just link this
[1871.96 → 1872.96] in the chat.
[1872.96 → 1873.96] Also, it'll be under the video for the archive.
[1873.96 → 1874.96] Perfect.
[1874.96 → 1876.96] Don't worry, I'm logged in now, so I got this.
[1876.96 → 1881.96] Okay, our last sponsor of the day, and I deserve this.
[1881.96 → 1883.96] I deserve to suffer, and it's okay.
[1883.96 → 1884.96] Do you want some jerky, James?
[1884.96 → 1885.96] Nothing.
[1885.96 → 1886.96] Okay.
[1886.96 → 1887.96] I'm a vegetarian.
[1887.96 → 1888.96] Oh.
[1888.96 → 1889.96] Sorry.
[1889.96 → 1890.96] Oh.
[1890.96 → 1893.96] Is this a new order?
[1893.96 → 1895.96] Yes, it is.
[1895.96 → 1896.96] Ohhhh.
[1896.96 → 1897.96] Is there two mojo- moos?
[1897.96 → 1898.96] No.
[1898.96 → 1899.96] I saw a second one.
[1899.96 → 1900.96] No.
[1900.96 → 1901.96] I saw a second one.
[1901.96 → 1902.96] There's only one Moho.
[1902.96 → 1903.96] Also, you're not allowed to have that.
[1903.96 → 1904.96] Yeah, I can.
[1904.96 → 1905.96] Because you were mean.
[1905.96 → 1906.96] I'm just going to have some first, okay?
[1906.96 → 1907.96] Okay.
[1907.96 → 1909.96] I won't even be able to taste it after.
[1909.96 → 1912.96] That would be real punishment.
[1912.96 → 1913.96] So.
[1913.96 → 1915.96] If you had to have that after, you already burnt your taste buds.
[1915.96 → 1925.96] The folks over at Savage Jerky were on a mission to create a snack that was full of flavour, but not bad for you.
[1925.96 → 1926.96] Oh.
[1926.96 → 1927.96] Oh.
[1927.96 → 1928.96] They've got 13 different flavours of jerky.
[1928.96 → 1931.96] Uh, the maple buffalo bacon is awesome.
[1931.96 → 1934.96] I love the garlic, lime, and cilantro Moho.
[1934.96 → 1936.96] This is like, my mouth is watering right now.
[1936.96 → 1938.96] I'm like super amped to eat that.
[1938.96 → 1939.96] There's-
[1939.96 → 1942.96] He's taking the Moho.
[1942.96 → 1943.96] I hate him so much.
[1943.96 → 1944.96] There's more than two.
[1944.96 → 1945.96] Did you notice that?
[1945.96 → 1946.96] I want all of it.
[1946.96 → 1949.96] You can have one.
[1949.96 → 1950.96] Just take it.
[1950.96 → 1951.96] Just take it.
[1951.96 → 1952.96] No, it's okay.
[1952.96 → 1953.96] No, take it.
[1953.96 → 1954.96] No, I was trying to find this one.
[1954.96 → 1955.96] Oh, the traditional.
[1955.96 → 1956.96] Yeah, the traditional's perfect too.
[1956.96 → 1957.96] I love the traditional.
[1957.96 → 1963.96] Um, so anyway, uh, which flavours do- okay, I think we discussed the flavours we like enough.
[1963.96 → 1965.96] Yeah, so I really like traditional-
[1965.96 → 1967.96] I'm going to eat this much Reaper, okay?
[1967.96 → 1968.96] Okay, okay.
[1968.96 → 1970.96] But I want some Moho first, okay?
[1970.96 → 1971.96] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1971.96 → 1972.96] Um-
[1972.96 → 1976.96] Moho habanero, in my opinion, if you're into spice, is a good place to start.
[1976.96 → 1981.96] Because it's quite spicy, but it's- it's not like, at a pain inducing level.
[1981.96 → 1982.96] Would we agree with that?
[1982.96 → 1987.96] Which one's one of the-um, which one's one of the spicy ones that I really like?
[1987.96 → 1989.96] Cause the Moho one's kind of sissy one.
[1989.96 → 1990.96] No, Moho habanero.
[1990.96 → 1992.96] Oh, the maple buffalo bacon.
[1992.96 → 1993.96] Oh, we've got more of that too.
[1993.96 → 1995.96] Oh, there are three packs of that.
[1995.96 → 1998.96] Oh, I'm like, super amped right now.
[1998.96 → 2000.96] The um-
[2000.96 → 2004.96] Oh, what's a- what's a good, like, a little bit spicy one?
[2004.96 → 2005.96] I think the Moho habanero.
[2005.96 → 2010.96] You know, I think we ended up eating all of those really early on, so we don't have-uh, yeah, the Moho habanero's a good one.
[2010.96 → 2011.96] Yeah.
[2011.96 → 2012.96] Yeah, sure, let's go with that one.
[2012.96 → 2015.96] But you have to- it's like, it's a little spicier than most people can take.
[2015.96 → 2022.96] Um, I would- I would assume- if you're like-okay, I would say if you're iffy about spice, that one might be a little bit too high.
[2022.96 → 2025.96] But if you like spice, that's probably where I'd suggest you start.
[2025.96 → 2026.96] Oh.
[2026.96 → 2027.96] Oh, good.
[2027.96 → 2029.96] So this is- this is your just Moho one, right?
[2029.96 → 2030.96] Mm-hmm.
[2030.96 → 2031.96] Yeah, okay.
[2031.96 → 2041.96] So you can use offer code LTT to save 10% on all their products, including their barbecue sauce, their hot sauce, their spice rub.
[2041.96 → 2046.96] They have a Carolina Reaper hot sauce that uses Carolina Reapers, which is one of the hottest peppers in the world.
[2046.96 → 2047.96] And-
[2047.96 → 2048.96] I see some nuts.
[2048.96 → 2054.96] For all orders this week, Savage Jerky will include a choose or a sticker with every order placed using our code.
[2054.96 → 2056.96] So that's code LTT.
[2056.96 → 2058.96] All right.
[2058.96 → 2062.96] Don't worry, I'm going to eat it.
[2062.96 → 2064.96] I hate you.
[2064.96 → 2067.96] Uh, flow plate?
[2067.96 → 2069.96] Oh yeah, sure, why not?
[2069.96 → 2071.96] Do you have the thing set up?
[2071.96 → 2072.96] I don't.
[2072.96 → 2073.96] You know what?
[2073.96 → 2074.96] That's why not.
[2074.96 → 2075.96] So do you want to do the next topic?
[2075.96 → 2076.96] Sure.
[2076.96 → 2077.96] What is the next topic?
[2077.96 → 2078.96] I don't know, there's like nothing.
[2078.96 → 2079.96] I think we're out of main topics, sir.
[2079.96 → 2080.96] Oh, why don't you talk about the Airbnb?
[2080.96 → 2081.96] Sure.
[2081.96 → 2085.96] Airbnb is building an apartment building, which like actually kind of makes sense, right?
[2085.96 → 2087.96] Isn't that just a hotel?
[2087.96 → 2088.96] Uh, anyway, we'll figure this out.
[2088.96 → 2093.96] The first project, a 324 unit building in Kissimmee?
[2093.96 → 2094.96] Wow.
[2094.96 → 2096.96] Hope I'm saying that right.
[2096.96 → 2098.96] That's an interesting name for a place.
[2098.96 → 2102.96] Uh, Kissimmee, Florida will be branded as NATO powered by Airbnb.
[2102.96 → 2103.96] Okay.
[2103.96 → 2105.96] The project is considered-
[2105.96 → 2109.96] This is like the trendiest like hipster nonsense ever.
[2109.96 → 2114.96] The project is considered the first in a series of development across the Southeastern United States.
[2114.96 → 2125.96] Airbnb and NATO will work together to design new units and buildings that include features like keyless entry and shared common spaces that make them optimal for home sharing.
[2125.96 → 2126.96] So it's a dorm.
[2126.96 → 2127.96] Okay.
[2127.96 → 2136.96] Keyless entry though, is a fascinating concept because if you had that set up for your house, I bet you the Airbnb app would let you in.
[2136.96 → 2137.96] Mm-hmm.
[2137.96 → 2138.96] Right.
[2138.96 → 2143.96] So all you would have to do as like the person that maintains this unit, which might even just be Airbnb.
[2143.96 → 2144.96] Sounds like it, yeah.
[2144.96 → 2145.96] So it's probably just a hotel.
[2145.96 → 2146.96] Yeah.
[2146.96 → 2148.96] Is there's probably no central desk.
[2148.96 → 2149.96] Right.
[2149.96 → 2151.96] You just go in, and you just go like use it.
[2151.96 → 2152.96] They'd have to clean up.
[2152.96 → 2153.96] Yeah.
[2153.96 → 2156.96] There'd be cleaning staff, but probably other than that I doubt it.
[2156.96 → 2157.96] Hmm.
[2157.96 → 2162.96] NATO will fully support the costs of construction and retain full ownership of the buildings.
[2162.96 → 2163.96] So it's a hotel.
[2163.96 → 2166.96] NATO tenants will sign annual leases.
[2166.96 → 2167.96] Okay.
[2167.96 → 2168.96] Okay.
[2168.96 → 2169.96] I get it.
[2169.96 → 2181.96] And we will be permitted to home share individual rooms or their entire units through Airbnb for up to 180 nights per year.
[2181.96 → 2182.96] Okay.
[2182.96 → 2190.96] So you have to live in it, but you're allowed to share it for half of the year, but you don't own it.
[2190.96 → 2191.96] And you-What?
[2191.96 → 2192.96] Why would anyone do this?
[2192.96 → 2193.96] I don't know.
[2193.96 → 2194.96] Like am I missing something here?
[2194.96 → 2198.96] Tenants who choose to share their homes will be part of Airbnb's friendly buildings program,
[2198.96 → 2202.96] in which hosts and landlords share revenues generated from home sharing?
[2202.96 → 2212.96] So you can sublet so that they don't have to take on all the risk, and they will share some of the revenue with you?
[2212.96 → 2213.96] Yeah.
[2213.96 → 2217.96] And you're going to have to buy like two units beside each other so you can live in one half the year and the other half the year.
[2217.96 → 2218.96] Pfft.
[2218.96 → 2219.96] Okay.
[2219.96 → 2221.96] I don't think people necessarily intend to do that.
[2221.96 → 2224.96] But you can't rent it for half the year.
[2224.96 → 2225.96] So what else are you going to do?
[2225.96 → 2226.96] Maybe you-
[2226.96 → 2234.96] Like honestly that's the- I know it sounds super stupid, but that's the most logical way I can think of it.
[2234.96 → 2236.96] Maybe we're totally missing something here.
[2236.96 → 2240.96] Maybe Twitch chat is like- I guess if it's in a vacation spot?
[2240.96 → 2241.96] Wait, is this just a timeshare?
[2241.96 → 2242.96] No, they don't get it either!
[2242.96 → 2243.96] Okay.
[2243.96 → 2245.96] So we're not the only ones.
[2245.96 → 2247.96] Yeah, it's a timeshare.
[2247.96 → 2249.96] Disney Kiss Me is right by it.
[2249.96 → 2250.96] Yeah, sure.
[2250.96 → 2253.96] So you'll be able to rent it a lot, but you can only rent it for 180 days.
[2253.96 → 2259.96] Okay, so it's apparently a requirement because of the law about what qualifies as a hotel versus an apartment.
[2259.96 → 2260.96] It's a city law.
[2260.96 → 2261.96] Like-
[2261.96 → 2266.96] Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, okay, sure.
[2266.96 → 2269.96] Um, people are talking about snowbirds.
[2269.96 → 2272.96] So people who want to be down there for half the year and up here.
[2272.96 → 2273.96] Yeah.
[2273.96 → 2274.96] But I mean-
[2274.96 → 2275.96] I mean-
[2275.96 → 2277.96] I mean that does make sense, actually.
[2277.96 → 2278.96] Okay.
[2278.96 → 2279.96] It is in Florida.
[2279.96 → 2280.96] Oh jeez.
[2280.96 → 2281.96] Okay.
[2281.96 → 2282.96] In Florida.
[2282.96 → 2286.96] So like Canadians or people that live in the northern part of the USA.
[2286.96 → 2287.96] Yeah.
[2287.96 → 2288.96] I could see that.
[2288.96 → 2291.96] People from like Minnesota.
[2291.96 → 2292.96] What?
[2292.96 → 2297.96] It's been a while, eh?
[2297.96 → 2298.96] Since you had a really spicy one?
[2298.96 → 2300.96] Because your tolerance was getting perfect.
[2300.96 → 2306.96] I was handling it a little better for a bit there.
[2306.96 → 2309.96] Anyway, I- I- Snowbirds make sense.
[2309.96 → 2315.96] I think buying two units and living in half-half is super weird, but it might make sense.
[2315.96 → 2321.96] The fact that it's right near Disney means that you'll probably be able to have it rented for like most days.
[2321.96 → 2323.96] Um, so yeah.
[2323.96 → 2324.96] I don't know.
[2324.96 → 2325.96] Oh boy.
[2325.96 → 2326.96] Interesting idea.
[2326.96 → 2327.96] I swear that's hotter than usual.
[2327.96 → 2328.96] Oh.
[2328.96 → 2329.96] No, that's the-
[2329.96 → 2330.96] Not even a new pack.
[2330.96 → 2331.96] The Apple enabled tenants-
[2331.96 → 2332.96] Not even a new pack.
[2332.96 → 2333.96] Not even a new pack.
[2333.96 → 2346.96] The Apple enabled tenants to manage guest stays remotely by triggering services powered by a master host at each property who will assist with items like guest check-in, cleaning, and linen service.
[2346.96 → 2347.96] So you-
[2347.96 → 2348.96] Oh.
[2348.96 → 2350.96] So you can-
[2350.96 → 2351.96] Yeah.
[2351.96 → 2352.96] Snowbirds.
[2352.96 → 2353.96] That makes tons of sense then.
[2353.96 → 2354.96] Okay.
[2354.96 → 2355.96] The-the building-
[2355.96 → 2356.96] Yeah.
[2356.96 → 2357.96] Has staff for cleaning and stuff.
[2357.96 → 2358.96] Yep.
[2358.96 → 2359.96] Yeah.
[2359.96 → 2360.96] And guest check-in.
[2360.96 → 2366.96] So you can be up in Minnesota or whatever you said, and then just use this app to like to manage your little property while you're away.
[2366.96 → 2367.96] Cool.
[2367.96 → 2368.96] Yeah, okay.
[2368.96 → 2377.96] I would expect that people wouldn't live there for 180 days because I don't think they would rent out every single day of the 180 days that they're not there.
[2377.96 → 2382.96] But they'd probably live there for a lot of it. Like a hundred days or something. I'm not sure.
[2382.96 → 2385.96] Okay. From TechCrunch.
[2385.96 → 2391.96] iOS and Samsung are now tied for market share in the US.
[2391.96 → 2395.96] Uh, here's the article.
[2395.96 → 2396.96] I feel a little bad now.
[2396.96 → 2400.96] And basically in a nutshell, Android is still quite far-
[2400.96 → 2401.96] Okay, can you do this?
[2401.96 → 2402.96] I feel pretty bad now.
[2402.96 → 2403.96] I just need a date.
[2403.96 → 2404.96] I'll be back.
[2404.96 → 2406.96] Do you have any like cream based stuff? Milk or anything?
[2406.96 → 2407.96] Nope.
[2407.96 → 2408.96] Okay.
[2408.96 → 2409.96] I'm fine.
[2409.96 → 2410.96] Water isn't going to help you.
[2410.96 → 2411.96] It won't hurt.
[2411.96 → 2412.96] Alright, alright.
[2412.96 → 2414.96] Um, so yeah.
[2414.96 → 2419.96] iOS and Samsung market share now tied in the US based on new data from Kantor Word Panel.
[2419.96 → 2421.96] He didn't put this up on screen.
[2421.96 → 2422.96] Blue.
[2422.96 → 2424.96] Give me a sec.
[2424.96 → 2427.96] There we go.
[2427.96 → 2436.96] Android is still far ahead in the US however, with 63.2% share to iOS's 35%.
[2436.96 → 2447.96] iPhones account for nearly 50% of Verizon specific phones, but I'm sure the cheaper carriers probably have a lot more Android phones because there is a lot cheaper Android phones in general.
[2447.96 → 2451.96] Samsung dominates in Great Britain with 38.4%.
[2451.96 → 2461.96] In urban China, iOS has grown from 13.4% market share last year to 17.7% thanks to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus sales.
[2461.96 → 2463.96] The top two bestsellers in urban China total.
[2463.96 → 2467.96] I wonder if the iPhone 8's gold colour is going to make a dent in China.
[2467.96 → 2472.96] Cause you know they got rid of rose gold, and they have like a more actual gold colour now.
[2472.96 → 2474.96] Okay, interesting.
[2474.96 → 2475.96] Probably actually.
[2475.96 → 2477.96] Um, what else do we have?
[2477.96 → 2479.96] They should make the buttons on it red.
[2479.96 → 2481.96] Yeah, I know right?
[2481.96 → 2483.96] That would do pretty well.
[2483.96 → 2487.96] Well, uh, Samsung did that Iron Man, uh, S7 was it I think?
[2487.96 → 2488.96] Yeah.
[2488.96 → 2490.96] Alright, check this out.
[2490.96 → 2493.96] So, goodbytesfromtheforum made an excellent post on the upcoming-
[2493.96 → 2494.96] Does it have to do with Microsoft?
[2494.96 → 2495.96] Yes.
[2495.96 → 2496.96] Heyday!
[2496.96 → 2500.96] On the upcoming Windows 10 Fall Creators Update that's coming on October 17th.
[2500.96 → 2501.96] I love you, man.
[2501.96 → 2502.96] So in just a few days.
[2502.96 → 2504.96] There is some cool stuff in here.
[2504.96 → 2508.96] Basically right at the top, he already had my attention.
[2508.96 → 2510.96] Because this is awesome!
[2510.96 → 2515.96] Task Manager now gets GPU usage and GPU memory usage.
[2515.96 → 2516.96] Oh, sick!
[2516.96 → 2517.96] Woo!
[2517.96 → 2521.96] So you can actually see, like, we had to fire up a third party utility like Afterburner.
[2521.96 → 2523.96] That's pretty cool.
[2523.96 → 2527.96] To see how Adobe Premiere or Adobe Media Encoder was using CPU versus GPU versus RAM.
[2527.96 → 2530.96] Now it is all in one convenient place.
[2530.96 → 2531.96] That's fantastic.
[2531.96 → 2532.96] Does it have temperature?
[2532.96 → 2533.96] Fantastic.
[2533.96 → 2534.96] And, get this.
[2534.96 → 2535.96] Uh, it doesn't look like it.
[2535.96 → 2536.96] No.
[2536.96 → 2537.96] But, hold on, hold on.
[2537.96 → 2541.96] It actually can break out by task!
[2541.96 → 2542.96] Whoa!
[2542.96 → 2543.96] What's using the GPU?
[2543.96 → 2545.96] Oh my god, that's pretty cool.
[2545.96 → 2546.96] Can I get a hell yeah?
[2546.96 → 2547.96] Hell yeah.
[2547.96 → 2548.96] Yeah, hell yeah!
[2548.96 → 2549.96] Hell yeah.
[2549.96 → 2551.96] That's frickin' awesome!
[2551.96 → 2554.96] But would it get you to go to Windows 10?
[2554.96 → 2555.96] No.
[2555.96 → 2556.96] Okay then.
[2556.96 → 2557.96] Alright, what else we got?
[2557.96 → 2558.96] Improvements to game mode.
[2558.96 → 2559.96] Um...
[2559.96 → 2563.96] Bash on Windows, get some improvements.
[2563.96 → 2564.96] Bash on Windows.
[2564.96 → 2565.96] Yep.
[2566.96 → 2569.96] The volume mixer, um...
[2570.96 → 2573.96] You can control the volume of UWP apps individually.
[2573.96 → 2574.96] I hate...
[2574.96 → 2576.96] If you run any UWP apps.
[2576.96 → 2579.96] The Plex UWP app has this, like, style issue.
[2579.96 → 2580.96] Have you moved on to the...
[2580.96 → 2585.96] Um, whenever you're playing back at original quality.
[2585.96 → 2589.96] And since a lot of the time I'm playing rips of Blu-rays because...
[2589.96 → 2590.96] No, totally not.
[2590.96 → 2591.96] No, totally not.
[2591.96 → 2594.96] But, like, am because...
[2595.96 → 2597.96] Like, that's why I own a Blu-ray drive.
[2597.96 → 2598.96] Yeah.
[2598.96 → 2599.96] Literally the only reason.
[2599.96 → 2600.96] Yeah.
[2600.96 → 2601.96] He owns all the Blu-rays.
[2601.96 → 2603.96] What else would you put a Blu-ray in?
[2603.96 → 2604.96] Yeah.
[2604.96 → 2605.96] Like, a player?
[2605.96 → 2609.96] So that you can, like, watch previews for a movie you pay for?
[2609.96 → 2610.96] Are you kidding me?
[2610.96 → 2611.96] Anyway, sorry.
[2612.96 → 2613.96] Um...
[2613.96 → 2616.96] It's, like, so trash compared to just, like, the regular player.
[2616.96 → 2617.96] Uh, folder protection.
[2617.96 → 2619.96] Yeah, so you've tried the regular player now.
[2619.96 → 2620.96] Um, yes.
[2620.96 → 2621.96] Yeah.
[2621.96 → 2622.96] And that fixes everything.
[2622.96 → 2623.96] Yeah.
[2623.96 → 2624.96] Um...
[2624.96 → 2625.96] Cool.
[2625.96 → 2626.96] Folder protection.
[2626.96 → 2637.96] It's basically a ransomware defence mechanism that will allow you to select a folder as a controlled folder access so that it can't just be, you know, altered by some program that's installed on your computer.
[2637.96 → 2638.96] Neat-o.
[2638.96 → 2639.96] Um, more power management.
[2639.96 → 2641.96] So there's a slider for it now.
[2641.96 → 2642.96] Ah, some gooey stuff.
[2642.96 → 2644.96] We're getting into kind of, uh, kind of the boring stuff.
[2644.96 → 2645.96] I wasn't sharing the post anymore.
[2645.96 → 2646.96] Oops.
[2646.96 → 2647.96] Um, start menu.
[2647.96 → 2649.96] I wonder if the start menu responds when you click on it now.
[2649.96 → 2652.96] Because, like, honestly, that is still...
[2652.96 → 2653.96] That's what broke me.
[2653.96 → 2655.96] My single biggest complaint about Windows 10.
[2655.96 → 2656.96] Yeah.
[2656.96 → 2658.96] Is how unresponsive the start menu is.
[2658.96 → 2660.96] Here, let's do a test.
[2660.96 → 2661.96] Angry video game nerd?
[2661.96 → 2662.96] Let's just see.
[2662.96 → 2663.96] Is the example on there?
[2663.96 → 2664.96] Click.
[2664.96 → 2665.96] Look at that.
[2665.96 → 2667.96] How delayed was that?
[2667.96 → 2668.96] How can you handle that?
[2668.96 → 2669.96] Oh!
[2669.96 → 2671.96] That bugs me so much!
[2671.96 → 2673.96] And it worked!
[2673.96 → 2674.96] It doesn't even always work.
[2674.96 → 2675.96] Oh.
[2675.96 → 2680.96] Like, compare that to Spotlight on OS 10.
[2680.96 → 2682.96] Spotlight is awesome.
[2682.96 → 2685.96] Why isn't this awesome?
[2685.96 → 2686.96] Okay.
[2686.96 → 2687.96] What the hell is Spotlight?
[2687.96 → 2688.96] Spotlight is their system-wide search.
[2688.96 → 2689.96] Is there a search thing?
[2689.96 → 2690.96] Oh!
[2690.96 → 2691.96] Oh, I've got another good one for you guys.
[2691.96 → 2693.96] I wonder if they've fixed this.
[2693.96 → 2694.96] Okay, is that...
[2694.96 → 2695.96] Delayed again.
[2695.96 → 2696.96] Rufus.
[2696.96 → 2697.96] Hmm.
[2697.96 → 2698.96] Hmm.
[2698.96 → 2699.96] That's weird.
[2699.96 → 2701.96] We've got Rufus the band.
[2701.96 → 2704.96] We've got Rufus Wainwright, the smaller band.
[2704.96 → 2707.96] And then we've got some USB results.
[2707.96 → 2708.96] Searches.
[2708.96 → 2709.96] Okay.
[2709.96 → 2711.96] Let's do an experiment.
[2711.96 → 2714.96] Let's go look at my downloads' folder.
[2714.96 → 2716.96] Oh boy.
[2716.96 → 2718.96] You know what?
[2718.96 → 2720.96] Let's wait to look at my downloads' folder.
[2720.96 → 2721.96] Oh, crap.
[2721.96 → 2723.96] I don't have it in there.
[2723.96 → 2724.96] Okay, well, whatever.
[2724.96 → 2725.96] It doesn't...
[2725.96 → 2726.96] You're not actually searching for some reason.
[2726.96 → 2727.96] Oh.
[2727.96 → 2728.96] No, no, I am.
[2728.96 → 2729.96] Oh, okay.
[2729.96 → 2730.96] You're doing that thing.
[2730.96 → 2731.96] Yeah, I'm doing my other thing.
[2731.96 → 2732.96] Okay.
[2732.96 → 2734.96] So I'm gonna work on this in the meantime.
[2734.96 → 2735.96] But, uh...
[2736.96 → 2737.96] Anyway, it makes me bad.
[2737.96 → 2740.96] Well, now it'll be a recent download, so it'll probably work.
[2740.96 → 2741.96] I'll see...
[2741.96 → 2742.96] No, no, no, no, no.
[2742.96 → 2743.96] It specifically doesn't find this.
[2743.96 → 2744.96] Rufus is cool, though.
[2744.96 → 2745.96] Ever.
[2745.96 → 2746.96] Rufus is awesome.
[2746.96 → 2747.96] I like...
[2747.96 → 2748.96] You're already in your downloads' folder.
[2748.96 → 2749.96] Okay.
[2749.96 → 2753.96] Okay, so let's try this again.
[2753.96 → 2756.96] So now I definitely have Rufus in my downloads' folder.
[2756.96 → 2759.96] Uh, what is all this?
[2759.96 → 2760.96] Okay.
[2760.96 → 2761.96] Rufus.
[2761.96 → 2764.96] Definitely still not there.
[2764.96 → 2767.96] Now, let's go back to my downloads' folder.
[2767.96 → 2771.96] Where Rufus definitely...
[2771.96 → 2772.96] Hey, right there!
[2772.96 → 2773.96] Oh, shoot.
[2773.96 → 2774.96] Hold on.
[2774.96 → 2776.96] Where Rufus definitely is.
[2776.96 → 2777.96] And yet...
[2777.96 → 2780.96] Rufus...
[2780.96 → 2783.96] Is definitely still not coming up.
[2783.96 → 2785.96] It's in the downloads' folder!
[2785.96 → 2786.96] It's not like...
[2786.96 → 2788.96] Okay, if we're talking like it's an...
[2788.96 → 2791.96] And if you're trying to make a smart search, he just downloaded it.
[2791.96 → 2793.96] Like it's an executable...
[2793.96 → 2796.96] We're not talking some executable and program files or something like that.
[2796.96 → 2799.96] Where there's like some kind of risk factor involved here.
[2799.96 → 2800.96] We're talking...
[2800.96 → 2802.96] It is specifically...
[2802.96 → 2804.96] Presumably intentionally.
[2804.96 → 2806.96] Because I can't even imagine something like this.
[2806.96 → 2807.96] Not...
[2807.96 → 2809.96] Well, I can't imagine it not being fixed.
[2809.96 → 2810.96] But come on!
[2810.96 → 2815.96] My like super jacked out version of Windows 8.1 definitely would have found that.
[2815.96 → 2817.96] Uh, yeah.
[2817.96 → 2821.96] Any other version of Windows 98 would have found that.
[2821.96 → 2822.96] Um...
[2822.96 → 2823.96] Yeah!
[2823.96 → 2824.96] Even with the stupid dog.
[2824.96 → 2826.96] Oh wait, the dog didn't come till XP.
[2826.96 → 2827.96] Yeah.
[2827.96 → 2828.96] It would have found it.
[2828.96 → 2829.96] Yeah!
[2829.96 → 2830.96] So mad.
[2830.96 → 2831.96] It would have taken a while.
[2831.96 → 2832.96] Yeah.
[2832.96 → 2833.96] Yeah.
[2833.96 → 2834.96] But it would have found it.
[2834.96 → 2836.96] Makes me so mad.
[2836.96 → 2839.96] People are probably explaining it to me in Twitch chat.
[2839.96 → 2840.96] Um...
[2840.96 → 2842.96] File extensions enabled?
[2842.96 → 2845.96] Yeah, anyway.
[2845.96 → 2847.96] It's not a bug, it's a feature.
[2847.96 → 2848.96] Yeah, I'm sure it is.
[2848.96 → 2849.96] Don't hate the dog.
[2849.96 → 2850.96] Oh!
[2850.96 → 2851.96] The dog was pretty bad.
[2851.96 → 2853.96] The dog was pretty bad.
[2853.96 → 2855.96] Um, anyway.
[2855.96 → 2856.96] What's our...
[2856.96 → 2857.96] What were we even talking about?
[2857.96 → 2859.96] Oh yeah, Windows 10.
[2859.96 → 2861.96] And how you're still not going to use it.
[2861.96 → 2862.96] Yeah.
[2862.96 → 2865.96] Oh, you know what else we should do while we're screen sharing with me?
[2865.96 → 2867.96] Is we should go through what's new on Float plane Club?
[2867.96 → 2868.96] Yeah, oh...
[2868.96 → 2869.96] So actually, do you want to give...
[2869.96 → 2870.96] Oh, did I call it Club?
[2870.96 → 2871.96] Sorry.
[2871.96 → 2872.96] Oh, well you did.
[2872.96 → 2873.96] It's already called...
[2873.96 → 2874.96] It's still called it up there.
[2874.96 → 2875.96] I need to change that.
[2875.96 → 2876.96] Yeah, but we're changing that.
[2876.96 → 2877.96] So the Float plane domain...
[2877.96 → 2880.96] I know we kinda jumped the gun announcing that we have Floatplane.com,
[2880.96 → 2884.96] because we had like, reached an agreement, but didn't technically have it transferred to us yet.
[2884.96 → 2885.96] Yeah.
[2885.96 → 2887.96] We definitely have it now.
[2887.96 → 2888.96] Yes.
[2888.96 → 2889.96] Right?
[2889.96 → 2890.96] Yeah.
[2890.96 → 2891.96] Yeah, okay.
[2891.96 → 2892.96] Definitely.
[2892.96 → 2893.96] Okay, good.
[2893.96 → 2895.96] I mean, it has the information like...
[2895.96 → 2896.96] Nope.
[2896.96 → 2897.96] What?
[2897.96 → 2898.96] Oh.
[2898.96 → 2899.96] Uh...
[2899.96 → 2900.96] Really?
[2900.96 → 2901.96] Yeah.
[2901.96 → 2902.96] Oh.
[2902.96 → 2903.96] Um...
[2903.96 → 2904.96] Oh.
[2904.96 → 2906.96] Give me a second.
[2906.96 → 2907.96] Really?
[2907.96 → 2908.96] Yeah.
[2908.96 → 2909.96] No, no, I just mean that didn't work.
[2909.96 → 2910.96] Yeah, I don't know why.
[2910.96 → 2914.96] He put who is and then the domain in a Google search, and it didn't work.
[2914.96 → 2915.96] Like, what are you using, Bing?
[2915.96 → 2916.96] Yeah.
[2916.96 → 2917.96] Oh man, I wish I had...
[2917.96 → 2918.96] Yeah, there you go.
[2918.96 → 2921.96] I wish I had screenshotted something the other day, because I was searching Bing for something,
[2921.96 → 2924.96] and it was astonishing how worthless the results were.
[2924.96 → 2926.96] And then I searched Google for it, and it was like...
[2926.96 → 2927.96] Yeah.
[2927.96 → 2928.96] Right there.
[2928.96 → 2929.96] Yeah.
[2929.96 → 2931.96] You can't like, tell that it's us, because it's...
[2931.96 → 2932.96] Oh, yeah, that's what I meant.
[2932.96 → 2933.96] But it...
[2933.96 → 2934.96] I was asking if you had domain privacy enabled.
[2934.96 → 2937.96] But it all moved over, and you can see there's a new expiration date.
[2937.96 → 2938.96] Cool.
[2938.96 → 2942.96] And the update date was like around when we were talking about it and stuff.
[2942.96 → 2945.96] So, do you want to like, tell people anything cool about it?
[2945.96 → 2947.96] About the domain or like, what's going on with the domain?
[2947.96 → 2948.96] Yeah, like what's going on with the domain?
[2948.96 → 2951.96] Um, there are two guys that I emailed today.
[2951.96 → 2953.96] I asked so that I can find out.
[2953.96 → 2957.96] Uh, to hopefully talk to them about getting hired.
[2957.96 → 2958.96] So that's exciting.
[2958.96 → 2959.96] That's cool.
[2959.96 → 2961.96] Though they both seem very skilled.
[2961.96 → 2963.96] One of them is in Canada, one of them is in the US.
[2963.96 → 2967.96] Um, I'm sort of sad about the US one, because...
[2967.96 → 2970.96] Hopefully you come through and take the job, because that would be wonderful.
[2970.96 → 2972.96] But it's going to be a little bit hard to get you up here.
[2972.96 → 2975.96] But, not as hard, because you have a degree.
[2975.96 → 2976.96] Which is very helpful.
[2976.96 → 2980.96] Because Canadian law, um, with the partnerships that we have with the US,
[2980.96 → 2985.96] makes it so that you can immigrate to Canada much more easily if you have a degree.
[2985.96 → 2986.96] Which is awesome.
[2986.96 → 2988.96] So if you want to locate up, it's fine.
[2988.96 → 2992.96] And you don't have to become like a full Canadian, ditch your American passport thing.
[2992.96 → 2994.96] You can just come up here and work.
[2994.96 → 2995.96] Which is great.
[2995.96 → 2998.96] Um, and then the other guy is from the east a bit.
[2998.96 → 3002.96] Um, much closer to one of my other developers.
[3002.96 → 3005.96] Um, but yeah, hopefully he will join as well.
[3005.96 → 3006.96] That's all going good.
[3006.96 → 3008.96] Lots of new design stuff has happened.
[3008.96 → 3009.96] Oh yeah.
[3009.96 → 3010.96] Not on this laptop, so I can't show you.
[3010.96 → 3015.96] But there's going to be a blog post going on to the float plane section of the forum soon
[3015.96 → 3018.96] that shows a lot of the new design stuff.
[3018.96 → 3022.96] We've done some fairly drastic things in terms of design.
[3022.96 → 3023.96] I can't show you guys right now.
[3023.96 → 3024.96] Oh.
[3024.96 → 3025.96] Um, but the main...
[3025.96 → 3026.96] Do you not want to show them?
[3026.96 → 3027.96] I'm down.
[3027.96 → 3028.96] Do you have it?
[3028.96 → 3030.96] Um, I should have the, uh, the email you sent me.
[3030.96 → 3031.96] What did you call it though?
[3031.96 → 3033.96] I think it was like a one word subject line.
[3033.96 → 3034.96] Uh...
[3034.96 → 3035.96] Because you're Luke.
[3035.96 → 3036.96] I do that.
[3036.96 → 3037.96] Yes.
[3037.96 → 3038.96] That is a thing that I do.
[3038.96 → 3039.96] Um...
[3039.96 → 3043.96] I like being able to read the whole subject line in one line when it's on a phone.
[3043.96 → 3044.96] Yeah.
[3044.96 → 3045.96] Yeah.
[3045.96 → 3048.96] Um, it's not very SEO optimized, so...
[3048.96 → 3049.96] I mean the forum is though.
[3049.96 → 3050.96] Yeah.
[3050.96 → 3051.96] Yeah.
[3051.96 → 3052.96] And the website will be once it's live.
[3052.96 → 3053.96] Okay.
[3053.96 → 3054.96] Is it...
[3054.96 → 3055.96] Is it in here?
[3055.96 → 3057.96] It's probably like float plane concept images.
[3057.96 → 3059.96] Ah, man.
[3059.96 → 3061.96] Killing me here.
[3061.96 → 3064.96] Just look for emails from me.
[3064.96 → 3065.96] Uh, yeah.
[3065.96 → 3067.96] I guess I don't get that many of those these days.
[3067.96 → 3068.96] Yeah.
[3068.96 → 3069.96] Okay.
[3069.96 → 3070.96] Sorry, I'm working on this.
[3070.96 → 3072.96] Do you want to do another topic in the meantime actually?
[3072.96 → 3073.96] Sure.
[3073.96 → 3074.96] Yeah.
[3074.96 → 3075.96] Do-do-do-do-do.
[3075.96 → 3079.96] And then we'll talk about them briefly here, but I'll talk about it much more in depth
[3079.96 → 3082.96] in the post on the full-pane section on the forum once that goes live.
[3082.96 → 3085.96] And we'll like answer questions there and stuff.
[3085.96 → 3086.96] Um...
[3086.96 → 3089.96] FLIR cameras...
[3089.96 → 3091.96] Oh, this is bad.
[3091.96 → 3094.96] ...have unremovable back doors.
[3094.96 → 3096.96] This is terrible.
[3096.96 → 3101.96] A security researcher has discovered secret hard-coded back door accounts in thermal security cameras
[3101.96 → 3104.96] manufactured by FLIR systems.
[3104.96 → 3110.96] The accounts are never exposed to the front-end user and cannot be changed through any normal
[3110.96 → 3111.96] operation of the camera.
[3111.96 → 3118.96] Certain now publicly username password combos will grant an attacker access over the device.
[3118.96 → 3119.96] Publicly available.
[3119.96 → 3120.96] Ouch.
[3120.96 → 3121.96] So...
[3121.96 → 3122.96] So FLIR needs to get this together.
[3122.96 → 3123.96] Yeah.
[3123.96 → 3126.96] Why do these companies build in back doors?
[3126.96 → 3127.96] Other vulnerabilities.
[3127.96 → 3128.96] Uh...
[3128.96 → 3129.96] Stream disclosure.
[3129.96 → 3138.96] Attackers can access the security cameras stream without needing to authenticate.
[3138.96 → 3140.96] Remote root exploit.
[3140.96 → 3144.96] Attackers can execute code on vulnerable cameras with root privileges.
[3144.96 → 3146.96] Authenticated OS command injection.
[3146.96 → 3152.96] Attackers with access to limited accounts can inject command and have them executed with root privileges.
[3152.96 → 3154.96] Multiple information disclosures.
[3154.96 → 3160.96] Attackers can access slash query certain camera files and read other local resources.
[3160.96 → 3165.96] The researcher reported vulnerabilities to FLIR but has not received a response regarding the issue.
[3165.96 → 3166.96] Great.
[3166.96 → 3169.96] The easiest way for FLIR customers...
[3169.96 → 3175.96] The easiest way for FLIR customers to protect themselves is to prevent access to their cameras from the internet
[3175.96 → 3180.96] by placing the devices behind a firewall until the vendor issues a patch.
[3180.96 → 3181.96] Brilliant.
[3181.96 → 3183.96] Sweet.
[3183.96 → 3185.96] Yeah, that's not me.
[3185.96 → 3186.96] Oh, really?
[3186.96 → 3189.96] And I can't possibly understand who the heck else it could be.
[3189.96 → 3190.96] Oh.
[3190.96 → 3191.96] Alright then.
[3191.96 → 3196.96] Because I'm the only person that it makes sense for, but I've never heard of them, and neither has Boiler.
[3196.96 → 3197.96] Okay.
[3197.96 → 3198.96] I don't know.
[3198.96 → 3200.96] I have the mock-ups up.
[3200.96 → 3201.96] Are these all of them?
[3201.96 → 3202.96] This is some of them.
[3202.96 → 3203.96] I mean, we don't have to show everything.
[3203.96 → 3204.96] You're still going to do the blog post, right?
[3204.96 → 3205.96] Yeah.
[3205.96 → 3206.96] Yeah, yeah.
[3206.96 → 3207.96] Okay.
[3207.96 → 3208.96] So...
[3208.96 → 3209.96] Well, this is the like bottom half.
[3209.96 → 3210.96] Dang it.
[3210.96 → 3211.96] It's not in any particular order, okay.
[3211.96 → 3212.96] So...
[3212.96 → 3213.96] Yeah.
[3213.96 → 3216.96] It might not be great to show the front...
[3216.96 → 3217.96] Can you go all the way up?
[3217.96 → 3218.96] Is this the full one?
[3218.96 → 3219.96] And it's like super pixelated.
[3219.96 → 3220.96] Yeah, why does this look so trash?
[3224.96 → 3226.96] Okay, so we're just going to download those and move on.
[3226.96 → 3228.96] But yeah, come on.
[3228.96 → 3229.96] What?
[3229.96 → 3231.96] That was posted by Doctor Who 1975 on the forum.
[3231.96 → 3232.96] Thank you very much for posting that.
[3232.96 → 3234.96] I'm gonna post
[3235.00 → 3241.80] The bleeping computer article in the twitch chat so you can all go pitchfork about it because
[3242.20 → 3247.34] That's like you probably should actually yeah, that seems like a very valid thing to do this is terrible. Oh, it's horrible
[3247.34 → 3252.70] Like security cameras you can't have you can't have security back doors in security cameras
[3253.24 → 3258.02] That's like it's like punching a hole in your security before you ever put in security. That's super garbage
[3258.02 → 3266.36] Exactly what happened actually super, super gargle you should have your security cameras behind a firewall and then have to VPN in to see them
[3267.20 → 3269.20] but not everyone
[3269.20 → 3272.14] Will do that right and like
[3272.62 → 3280.00] This should have been disclosed and is completely BS and the fact that you should have your security camera set up that other way
[3280.62 → 3283.96] Doesn't matter in regard to this because this shouldn't have happened
[3284.96 → 3288.68] Anyway, wow, this is like the world's worst screenshot
[3289.64 → 3291.64] This full front page one
[3293.14 → 3299.56] It's just super pixelated yeah, it's like okay, well, I'll put up a not super pixelated version kind of show it for now
[3299.56 → 3304.50] Yeah, okay, so it's pretty similar to the original front page that we showed you guys
[3305.14 → 3311.00] But with some changes on the lower part yeah first spoiler there's the new logo that we have
[3311.00 → 3316.42] Hold on I got, but this is a trash version so we might want to show them the logo on one that isn't so pixelated
[3316.42 → 3318.50] Yeah, but that's the new logo that we have yeah
[3318.50 → 3322.86] The top part hasn't really changed at all there's been minor changes to the creator tiles right here
[3323.76 → 3330.16] Those are just randomly generated names. So don't worry about it. Cool. I did check with that this section has changed a fair amount
[3331.16 → 3333.16] There were concerns
[3333.16 → 3336.72] That the previous version wouldn't be able to scale onto different devices
[3336.72 → 3341.34] Yeah, this version is set up so that it can scale properly onto different devices, which is good
[3342.06 → 3344.06] And I'll talk more about the front page
[3344.56 → 3349.16] Somewhere else cool on the next one any of the main pages I'd say no
[3349.16 → 3353.48] What would you consider to be a main page we can go with that one how based examples sure?
[3354.48 → 3355.48] Cool
[3355.48 → 3357.72] So this one has some stuff going on
[3357.72 → 3363.22] This is just an example page of how tiles can work, and the tiles would obviously have like
[3363.22 → 3368.70] Videos on them or pictures or something yeah, they wouldn't just be like purple gradients
[3368.70 → 3371.94] So it'll look more lively and interesting yeah, but that was just an example
[3371.94 → 3375.96] The main thing that I want to show you guys here is actually this one's not a good example for it. Can we
[3376.58 → 3378.58] do do
[3379.04 → 3380.58] Do do do
[3380.58 → 3382.08] Hello
[3382.08 → 3382.72] There we go
[3382.72 → 3384.50] That's a much better example for it this again
[3384.50 → 3387.72] Those are just empty blocks and none of those blocks are staying where they are so
[3388.64 → 3392.64] Completely ignore that yeah, it's actually gonna just be one big section
[3392.64 → 3395.48] Cool not three sections, so don't worry about that
[3396.26 → 3399.18] But the main thing you might notice is there's no top bar
[3399.64 → 3401.64] Wow no top bar
[3401.64 → 3406.60] No top bar bit of a controversial change, but I think it's perfect? I like it
[3406.76 → 3411.68] We want float plane to be a home for the creators that are on float plane
[3411.68 → 3418.10] Yeah, so we want to get out of their way as much as possible, and so we get this real estate here. Yeah, and
[3418.10 → 3420.10] and
[3420.10 → 3423.64] This here yeah, and then we're out of the way
[3423.88 → 3427.34] We just want to serve the content we want to make sure all your stuff is fine
[3427.34 → 3433.60] And then you get the whole right side of the screen and our stuff will never touch you etc etc etc
[3433.60 → 3436.60] You're all good on your own, which I think is really cool
[3436.60 → 3440.76] So here are some terms and conditions trying to make them look kind of friendly
[3440.76 → 3445.38] Yeah, that's the whole front page and one in one view
[3445.38 → 3449.56] That's like an example of what an about page might look like yep
[3449.98 → 3455.52] So there's like staff tiles down at the bottom so you can have like the people that work on your channel or like
[3456.10 → 3460.36] Affiliated channels or something there whatever you kind of want to put there
[3461.14 → 3463.14] Yeah, that's just the bottom of the site
[3463.14 → 3468.12] So in terms of content that we have over there right now
[3468.94 → 3470.94] man, it's been
[3470.94 → 3478.46] It's been kind of a crazy week actually okay. What do we get? We've got tech wiki. What happens if you don't shut your computer down properly?
[3480.68 → 3483.90] We've got overkill office upgrade this one actually went up on YouTube today
[3484.20 → 3489.38] But has since had its thumbnail change, but that doesn't really matter. We've got the LG ultrawide festival video. Oh, what's up?
[3489.38 → 3492.50] Luke was wrong calm. Oh my god
[3494.30 → 3498.76] That's just even landing on the page is amazing
[3499.76 → 3501.76] All right, what is it? Oh
[3506.42 → 3512.38] Holy crap, that's a perfect screenshot when is that even from that's not now
[3512.38 → 3514.38] Is that mod 24?
[3514.82 → 3517.32] Like what is this maybe I've got that like
[3517.92 → 3521.70] the mic with the metal was wrong powered by square space
[3523.04 → 3523.76] oh
[3523.76 → 3526.22] man, just the font and
[3527.56 → 3528.24] that
[3528.24 → 3531.94] screenshot like I look I look like slightly dazed, and I'm just
[3532.54 → 3534.54] Wow, terrible Wow
[3535.54 → 3539.78] So good. All right. What else we got here? Oh, we've got
[3539.78 → 3541.78] uh
[3541.78 → 3543.78] iPhone 8 and 8 plus review
[3544.20 → 3548.50] So that's a thing. Oh, that's exciting. Yeah, that'll be coming to YouTube pretty soon
[3549.88 → 3557.90] We've got oh, we've got part two of turning LG's wallpaper TV into a window. This thing's crazy
[3557.90 → 3559.90] It's so awesome
[3559.90 → 3561.90] I watched that already. We've got it's finally up
[3562.58 → 3567.84] Testing the oldest SLI setup. I didn't notice that was there. Including screen capture
[3567.84 → 3575.72] Really of old games running yes, so we used an HDMI to our we used a VGA to HDMI adapter and then used our capture cards
[3575.72 → 3577.78] Okay, yep, it looks perfect cool
[3579.72 → 3584.38] Wow, that's really cool. We've got the set destruction vlog. Oh, Geez that's up
[3584.38 → 3588.88] So this is us tearing down a lot of the old sets you should tell them what cards are in
[3589.60 → 3597.16] That SLI video yeah, they're voodoo's yeah. Whoa. Yeah, so it's its awesome. We've got scrapyard war six
[3597.16 → 3605.56] Part two and very soon like this weekend part three war six part three and part one is obviously also there
[3605.76 → 3611.60] Man, there's a lot of good stuff on there right now. I think that's pretty much the bulk of it
[3611.60 → 3615.20] Yeah, I don't know if handy tech under 100 stuff for your stuff is on YouTube
[3615.84 → 3617.46] Not a hundred percent sure about that one
[3617.46 → 3621.36] But yeah scrapyard wars is the other big piece that is not on YouTube yet
[3621.36 → 3629.54] All right leading us back to I don't know is there anything else to talk about this week like what even happened?
[3629.54 → 3632.98] I don't think stuff your stuff is oh, yeah, it is yeah
[3633.58 → 3637.58] um AU options is roadmap is on TFT central
[3638.34 → 3639.02] um
[3639.02 → 3644.14] So 27 inch 3840 by 2160 feel 4k monitors at 144 Hertz
[3644.94 → 3651.14] Already planned for several monitors which we know because we've done pieces on two of them three of them two of them
[3651.14 → 3655.56] One Asus one back at CES and one acer one at their show in New York
[3656.52 → 3663.16] But production has been delayed until November 2017 and those displays are not expected till Q1 2018
[3663.16 → 3668.44] A 32-inch version 4k 32 inches 144 Hertz. That's pretty dope
[3668.98 → 3673.42] Not planned until Q3 2018 with displays not likely till Q4
[3674.28 → 3676.66] 240 Hertz refresh rate TN panels
[3676.66 → 3685.08] Uh, ooh now up to 1440p Wow, that's pretty killer because 1440p at 240 Hertz is
[3685.62 → 3690.66] Doable in esports titles not that esports guys necessarily care, but that's
[3691.94 → 3693.94] Is what it is?
[3693.94 → 3695.94] uh, they've got a 120 Hertz
[3696.66 → 3698.66] 35 inch VA
[3698.66 → 3704.50] 1440p coming, and they've got a 35-inch VA 3440 1440 200 Hertz with full HDR
[3704.50 → 3706.50] But it's delayed until Q2 2018
[3709.14 → 3711.14] Yeah, so I guess that's uh
[3711.14 → 3712.02] Is that video up?
[3712.02 → 3716.10] Yeah, so that's when you're going to see monitor videos coming from us
[3717.38 → 3719.22] Okay, this
[3719.22 → 3724.82] Sort of matters. This was posted by space reptile on the forum and this is a rumour right now
[3725.70 → 3730.00] But it is root. This is a rumour about a product that is rumoured
[3730.00 → 3735.20] So it is rumoured that a GTX 1070 ti is coming, and I can tell you guys honestly
[3735.20 → 3738.00] I don't know one way or the other. I haven't heard a damn thing
[3738.64 → 3739.92] It is also rumoured
[3740.56 → 3746.72] That the 1070 ti because the rumoured specs looked really close to the 1080 ti
[3746.72 → 3748.88] Like it was going to be kind of stepping on it a little bit
[3749.44 → 3752.00] It is rumoured that the specs
[3753.04 → 3754.08] are
[3754.08 → 3755.04] are true
[3755.04 → 3762.64] But that in order to keep it from overlapping too much with the 1080 ti it will not be overclockable
[3764.88 → 3766.16] Can you imagine
[3767.20 → 3767.76] Nvidia
[3769.36 → 3770.08] Having the
[3771.76 → 3773.36] I mean, I want to say audacity
[3773.92 → 3777.44] Okay, I'm going to throw in potentially an unpopular opinion here
[3778.24 → 3784.40] I would be I'm not, but I would be completely okay with this if they called it something else
[3786.00 → 3788.00] Hmm if it wasn't a tie
[3788.64 → 3789.84] Tie has always been like
[3791.12 → 3791.68] Hell yeah
[3792.32 → 3794.40] Like every time a tie has come out. It's been like a
[3795.12 → 3796.88] Nicer kind of more powerful
[3797.52 → 3799.52] Push is further kind of card
[3799.52 → 3800.88] If they called it something else
[3801.68 → 3805.12] I would maybe be okay with it because there's a lot of people that aren't going to overclock their cards anyway
[3806.08 → 3807.68] So if they're like I can save some money
[3808.40 → 3811.44] Buy this thing not overclock it because I wasn't planning on doing it anyway
[3811.92 → 3815.04] That's fine. But if you knew they were non-overclockable versions
[3816.80 → 3818.00] I don't think I'd care that much
[3818.72 → 3819.20] Interesting
[3820.08 → 3822.64] But it's a tie they're not telling you this
[3822.96 → 3825.60] So basically Nvidia is saying this is all rumours
[3825.92 → 3830.72] Well, and yeah, if this is true Nvidia would basically be coming out and saying well
[3831.52 → 3834.24] Our competitor can't compete with this anyway, so
[3834.24 → 3840.32] What does it I would like to think pay more get more not been very well for overclocking?
[3840.88 → 3844.16] I don't think it's I know yeah, no, I know that no there's no way
[3846.56 → 3847.52] Do you think there's going to be
[3848.24 → 3850.88] Bios flashes that allow you to overclock them? I doubt it
[3850.88 → 3855.76] I mean that has been a thing on the a and b side, but it's never really been a thing on the Nvidia side of things
[3855.76 → 3858.64] Uh, this was originally posted by AG
[3860.32 → 3860.40] um
[3860.40 → 3862.32] 12 33
[3863.44 → 3868.80] Razor is teasing its first smartphone with the reveal apparently coming on November 1st
[3870.88 → 3875.68] So in a surprise to absolutely no one mining tan wears jeans
[3876.96 → 3880.48] And a black t-shirt oh all the time. No, you're thinking of Jensen. Oh, right
[3880.48 → 3885.76] And the phone will have a bright green logo on the back of it
[3888.80 → 3891.36] Okay, I can make some other guesses about the phone. Do you want to hear him?
[3892.80 → 3900.96] Sure, it will have a 1440p display it will use a snapdragon 835 processors. Oh heck yeah, it will be available with
[3902.16 → 3903.28] You know what?
[3903.28 → 3904.56] I'm going to say
[3904.56 → 3906.56] 64 gigs of storage
[3906.56 → 3909.60] And it will have micro SD expansion, you know
[3909.60 → 3912.16] I bet you the front's going to be black. It will have volume
[3912.80 → 3915.28] Buttons those might be green. It will be
[3917.28 → 3919.28] Uh, cloud ones of what?
[3919.84 → 3925.68] Uh, yeah, yeah, so they acquired um, what was it next biting was the company called next bit who made the robin
[3926.48 → 3930.88] And so Nick was yelling that they could be pushing all the storage into the cloud. I doubt it though. It's razor
[3930.88 → 3933.12] They probably just threw some Nan flash chips in it
[3933.68 → 3934.96] um
[3934.96 → 3938.88] I mean what else can I what else can I guess about it the phone I'm guessing will be
[3939.60 → 3941.12] Hello mediocre
[3941.12 → 3946.88] Because unless you've invested literally a decade of research into smartphone camera stuff
[3947.28 → 3949.60] You're going to end up with like an off-the-shelf thing
[3950.16 → 3952.40] Um, and really that's what makes
[3953.36 → 3957.44] Google's phone and apple's phone and Samsung's phone better is the processing now
[3957.44 → 3958.96] Not necessarily the sensor
[3958.96 → 3960.32] This one's like RGB screen
[3960.32 → 3960.96] RGB screen
[3960.96 → 3964.56] Yeah, it's the screen is going to be RGB up the butt
[3964.56 → 3965.60] They should have a mode
[3966.64 → 3969.68] That's like the like night clock mode that some phones have
[3970.64 → 3971.36] Do you know what I mean?
[3972.00 → 3973.20] You put in like clock mode
[3973.20 → 3976.56] Oh, yeah, yeah, but instead of that it has like
[3977.12 → 3979.92] Bold numbers so you can see them that are all black
[3979.92 → 3983.52] Yeah, and then all the rest of it is like chroma to hell yeah
[3985.52 → 3989.36] You got to sleep with those multiple colours on your face all right. Do you want to talk about oculus stuff?
[3989.92 → 3990.32] um
[3991.76 → 3993.04] Not really
[3993.04 → 3993.44] wow
[3993.44 → 3995.28] That kind of says it all, doesn't it?
[3996.08 → 3996.24] Yeah
[3996.24 → 4002.32] There are two new headsets coming out one's called a go one is currently called Santa Cruz, but I'm assuming that name will change
[4003.60 → 4004.56] um
[4004.56 → 4009.60] The go will cost 200 dollars will ship next year early next year you sound so dead
[4009.60 → 4015.20] And apparently will fit the sweet spot between rift and other portable smartphone powered VR devices
[4015.84 → 4022.00] As it's uh, I believe it's a high quality affordable experience that doesn't tether you to a pc
[4022.80 → 4026.48] It is the most accessible VR experience ever nice
[4027.12 → 4029.28] um, it has positional tracking on
[4030.00 → 4031.04] motion controllers
[4031.76 → 4034.72] But its power is uh this I'm talking about the Santa Cruz now to be clear
[4034.72 → 4040.16] Okay has positional tracking on its motion controllers, but its power is more on the level of a gear VR
[4040.80 → 4042.80] meant to be more accessible than rift
[4043.36 → 4046.32] cool and ultimately point the way forward
[4046.96 → 4049.12] Toward mainstream VR now to be fair
[4049.92 → 4051.92] um
[4051.92 → 4055.76] Things need to be accessible and desktop VR is super
[4056.56 → 4062.88] Intensely not accessible right now. Yeah, you need big areas to actually play on these things
[4062.88 → 4067.76] You need powerful pcs. It's not affordable. It's not accessible. Furthermore, it's not easy to set up
[4068.32 → 4070.32] It's annoying
[4070.32 → 4075.84] Etc, et cetera, et cetera, it's not going to push mainstream like it hasn't it's been good in the enthusiast space
[4075.84 → 4078.32] I know there's a lot of people that are still really enjoying their VR setups
[4078.32 → 4082.24] And there are some really cool games for it. That's great and other applications
[4083.04 → 4084.08] Yeah, definitely
[4084.08 → 4092.16] um, but ones that work fine with a seated experience the stuff that's a drastic shift or change in terms of technology needs to be
[4092.96 → 4096.00] Accessible for wide market to actually accept it like the Wii
[4096.56 → 4102.64] Was really weird in terms of gaming devices, but it was cheap. There's like 200 bucks for the console
[4102.64 → 4106.80] I bet you most people bought it at about the 200 price tag even the games that
[4107.36 → 4108.48] um
[4108.96 → 4115.76] Weren't like smash hit triple-a titles like one of the most fun things on the Wii was Wii sports absolutely that came with it
[4116.00 → 4119.04] And it was fun because my you could just it all the time screw around
[4119.76 → 4124.32] The whole family could get involved whoever comes over could get involved within seconds
[4124.72 → 4128.88] Understand the game be playing and be social really easily and if you're by yourself
[4128.88 → 4132.32] You could just bowl or do whatever, and it was still fun. Um
[4135.76 → 4137.36] It needs to get to that level now
[4138.24 → 4143.92] Technically these are going in that direction. I don't think they're going to be enough. I don't think they're gonna work
[4145.60 → 4146.00] um
[4147.44 → 4148.40] Yeah
[4148.48 → 4151.68] One of the big things that we had going for it was that it sold to families
[4152.24 → 4153.68] Yeah, um a
[4154.24 → 4158.72] Solo experience that closes you off in the world is not going to sell to families very well. No, not really
[4158.88 → 4162.00] Um, but there are still definitely a lot of people that will buy it. I
[4162.48 → 4165.12] Personally don't think that either of these are going to be smash hits
[4165.12 → 4169.68] I personally don't think that either of these are really going to work because I think VR is still a few years out
[4170.48 → 4172.48] um
[4172.88 → 4177.92] And right now the only thing I'm really interested in is like really powerful VR because
[4178.64 → 4179.92] I think we're a few years out from
[4180.80 → 4182.80] non-tethered experiences being
[4183.04 → 4188.64] Properly powerful enough so I'm not interested in these personally all right last order of business
[4188.96 → 4190.96] coffee lack
[4191.68 → 4193.68] Coffee lake oh
[4194.56 → 4198.32] He's in very short supply right now. It's unclear whether it's overwhelming demand
[4198.88 → 4201.68] Or very very very limited supply
[4202.16 → 4208.00] But it is pretty much impossible to buy a core i5 8400 core i7 8700k
[4208.56 → 4208.96] um
[4210.08 → 4212.80] Yeah, they are selling like hot
[4214.40 → 4217.60] Cakes I was going to say backs but no one wants a hot back
[4217.60 → 4219.60] Well, you might
[4220.24 → 4221.04] um
[4221.04 → 4226.48] To try and encourage people to still buy CPUs intel's doing a game without compromises bundle so you get uh
[4227.12 → 4230.96] Let's see two free games total war Warhammer 2 and assassin's creed origins
[4231.36 → 4234.16] But it doesn't apply to coffee lake it only applies to their older stuff
[4234.16 → 4236.40] Which sort of makes senses if you think about it but uh
[4237.12 → 4242.72] Is annoying some people because they're like no compromises would mean getting the best processor and getting a cool bundle
[4242.72 → 4244.72] Um and then that's pretty much it
[4245.84 → 4247.84] Anything else for ranks for you?
[4248.40 → 4250.64] Not particularly all right I'm good then yeah
[4251.04 → 4256.24] Signing off you guys we'll see you again next week same bad time same bad channel get subscribed on float plane watch
[4256.24 → 4261.12] three episodes of scrapyard wars this week or everybody else this weekend
[4269.12 → 4271.12] Yes, there will be an after party there will
[4271.12 → 4275.20] Oh, mine oh oh oh oh like your stream okay. Yeah, I have to go
[4276.40 → 4278.24] I have to go do something with Jake
[4279.04 → 4281.04] oh
[4282.40 → 4290.48] We're using the old 10 GPU server thing for uh bitcoin money oh not bitcoin but like a coin yeah yeah
[4292.08 → 4294.08] That would actually be a good name for a cryptocurrency
[4294.72 → 4298.72] A coin because like it's irrelevant the branding doesn't matter yeah
[4300.72 → 4302.72] No one cares
