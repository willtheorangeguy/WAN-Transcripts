[0.00 → 12.12] and we are live we're live on the wan show with our special guest jays two cents i take
[12.12 → 18.92] special very serious very special guest the specialist guest the greatest uh you know what's
[18.92 → 24.96] actually kind of funny is it didn't occur to me until we were already live, but it is possible
[24.96 → 33.76] that we still have the lower third from no we do not somebody cleared out that folder that would
[33.76 → 38.04] have been super cool if we still had like an ancient lower third from having you on as a guest
[38.04 → 42.96] like two years ago three years ago it was probably more like three yeah wow probably more like three
[42.96 → 48.28] so um lets uh let's do a quick rundown of some of the topics that we want to discuss today actually
[48.28 → 53.68] I've got one that I'm not sure if is in the doc but jay you and i both released videos discussing the
[53.68 → 60.96] x299 platform and sort of gave some thoughts on it um you know I'd love to kind of go head to head
[60.96 → 65.08] about it and kind of exchange some of those thoughts and through the audience would love for us to flesh
[65.08 → 70.16] things out a little bit so uh I'm all about fleshing out if you know what i mean and um
[71.32 → 78.38] see how much awkward silence i can get i got a good two heartbeats there yeah yeah that was solid um
[78.38 → 84.50] and uh we've also got a lot of Apple news this week that I'm sure everyone is going to have an
[84.50 → 89.14] opinion on because some of it looks amazing and some of it looks like it should be amazing but
[89.14 → 97.62] actually um wait is this seriously not in here in detail okay that's fine we can get to
[97.62 → 103.84] that later so um yeah without further ado let's roll the intro and get right into this because there's
[103.84 → 110.84] a lot to cover today yep i can hear it oh right we're on the same thing now
[110.84 → 134.84] sponsors for the show savage jerky fresh books and cable mod
[134.84 → 145.46] okay so why don't we jump right into the big highlight from the i didn't put the guest up
[145.46 → 152.10] there he is uh why don't we jump into the big highlight from Apple's event oh and i just realized
[152.10 → 156.20] we don't have jay when I'm sharing my screen so we're just going to have to do the screen shares
[156.20 → 162.84] really quickly, so this is from the verge the eight biggest announcements from apple WWDC 2017
[162.84 → 172.00] number one apple announces the home pod speaker to take on Amazon Echo and Sonos
[172.00 → 181.92] so can I kick this off by saying who here actually uses and or desires my grandpa all the time same
[181.92 → 188.14] with my mom okay so tell me exactly what it is that people are using i almost have home speakers for
[188.14 → 195.16] um i think part of the idea is that it's it can be louder than your phone automatically without
[195.16 → 200.00] having your volume settings already on uh i think it's more responsive to voice from further away
[200.00 → 208.88] I'm assuming those things are uh what it's for i don't use it jay what do you uh
[208.88 → 215.42] but yeah my grandpa and my mom are both very i was so unenthusiastically like not following
[215.42 → 219.58] anything to do with apple until i saw the Vega thing which I'm sure you're going to talk about but
[219.58 → 224.68] yeah yeah i was going to get to the important stuff later yeah i mean i don't know i could see like my
[224.68 → 230.20] dad who's fairly disabled liking voice command stuff but i mean i can't bring myself to get an
[230.20 → 236.86] Alexa or a Google home so why would I want this like i think part of the idea is if he's like watching
[236.86 → 240.72] the TV or like cooking food or something, and he just doesn't even want to pull his phone out
[240.72 → 247.36] he can just talk to it, and it's fine uh wait hold on a second apparently jay is way out of sync
[247.36 → 251.72] he wasn't um he looks in sync here
[251.72 → 255.94] uh
[255.94 → 256.88] uh
[256.88 → 261.64] see i bring the old tech talk mantra with me wherever i go
[261.64 → 270.22] oh it's slightly behind yeah oh people are like yeah he's way out of sync 100 to 200 milliseconds
[270.22 → 277.54] yeah it's yeah okay um i mean there's only so much you could do with video over IP right
[277.54 → 287.42] wow okay you know what i think we're just not gonna care at all so okay so basically I'll say this i have
[287.42 → 291.84] a Sonos speaker actually i have a few Sonos speakers and what i really like about them is that
[291.84 → 298.60] you can turn on one room or two rooms or a bunch of rooms um i do think Sonos speakers are overpriced
[298.60 → 305.96] so for apple to come in and say okay yeah we're going to have a home speaker that um is you know sounds
[305.96 → 314.78] great and is also a competitor for Sonos and also happens to have Siri for if you're wondering like
[314.78 → 321.06] how tall the average giraffe is or whatever sure than i guess there's i guess there's some utility
[321.06 → 329.44] there but i can't figure out who is actually using apple home kit stuff and i can't figure out what
[329.44 → 335.50] exactly it is that people other than me have figured out how to do with Siri that's actually
[335.50 → 343.18] useful that's one of my bigger questions is because like i and i feel like it was actually better
[343.18 → 348.68] before have you had that experience i feel like my voice activated stuff has gotten worse
[348.68 → 355.92] over time almost every time i go to use Siri like here let's do a live demo hey Siri
[355.92 → 359.26] hey Siri
[359.26 → 364.88] can you set a reminder for me to pick up my kids at 10 p.m tonight
[364.88 → 372.46] okay I'll remind you okay well whatever it managed to get it right after not hearing me the first time
[372.46 → 381.08] but like so many times it'll, it'll get the uh it'll have like the time in the reminder, and it'll be like
[381.08 → 386.96] oh well when would you like to do that like holy crap you literally have 10 p.m right there i don't know
[386.96 → 392.42] how i could have been much more clear than that um and I've just been so frustrated with it lately that
[392.42 → 399.40] i just can't imagine myself buying a dedicated appliance just to be mad and after three attempts
[399.40 → 404.60] pull out my phone and just freaking type it in you know when i did my Sonos stuff last year uh because
[404.60 → 410.32] i I'm like you, i have quite a bit of Sonos stuff, and it really had one selling point for me and that
[410.32 → 415.14] was the app controlled volume and whatnot because when you have toddlers and kids like me who like to
[415.14 → 420.22] crank the TV super loud it was just convenient to be upstairs be able to turn the TV down without having
[420.22 → 425.14] to yell turn the TV down like that one feature alone for me was worth it but um i mean in terms
[425.14 → 430.32] of like home assistance and home speakers and stuff like that i don't use any of the other
[430.32 → 434.70] functionality built into the Sonos except just being able to switch it and maybe stream some
[434.70 → 440.62] music Spotify whatever to play a little bit of devil's advocate i guess no one's really fighting
[440.62 → 447.62] for the other side but um i think for like the more armies out there i guess is that what we
[447.62 → 453.38] call them now i guess um i think this serves actually a better use case because it fits the like
[453.38 → 460.62] super classic easy to understand dynamic of like the person chopping vegetables in their kitchen
[460.62 → 465.46] who like randomly thinks of something and doesn't want to stop like hey can you convert three quarters
[465.46 → 469.72] of a cup to the metric system yeah and like apparently it actually does that pretty well
[469.72 → 474.62] i know your phone didn't just pick you up i could see my wife doing that yeah and like i know your phone
[474.62 → 479.72] didn't just pick you up very well but a dedicated appliance a 350 dollar appliance for that i
[479.72 → 487.48] of course though so again back to okay, so there are two discussions to have here one is this thing
[487.48 → 492.70] really that useful and the second one is will armies flock out and buy it so the first i don't know
[492.70 → 497.28] about flock out and buy it well but hold on i was about to make an argument there because when i was
[497.28 → 504.30] over in Taiwan i stayed at Dennis's parents house for the first day because i our hotel wasn't
[504.30 → 512.14] available to check in yet anyway um, and they actually had like so many dedicated appliances
[512.14 → 520.10] that my zero clutter lifestyle would not allow me to take for free let alone go out and buy
[520.10 → 525.40] so like zero clutter lifestyle they have uh they have at home you haven't been to my house lately
[525.40 → 533.10] have you yeah well okay i have kid stuff yeah i have kid stuff but like okay like my aunt she has
[533.10 → 539.54] everything from like she has a dedicated juicer just for lemons and limes okay, okay yeah yeah she's got a
[539.54 → 545.62] noodle maker yeah she's got it okay she's got a salad spinner and I'm sitting here going you know what
[545.62 → 551.02] you know how you dry the salad you kind of shake it over the sink, and you put it in the bowl it's done
[551.02 → 555.82] you know that's like it's like spending too much time on QVC or the shopping network right you just
[555.82 → 560.16] like oh that looks useful, and you buy it, but then you really never use it so Dennis's parents own
[560.16 → 566.02] an in-home sauna and remember this is in Taiwan like it's not a huge house in Taiwan it's a little
[566.02 → 570.80] bit surprising but if i remember correctly in Finland there's a sauna per person okay saunas are just
[570.80 → 577.82] not that popular in Canada and number two they had this like riding thing that i posted
[577.82 → 584.26] on social media that was like an exercise device of some sort and I'm sitting here going you know
[584.26 → 590.82] that is like the erotic bode flex you know yeah i think it was for core exercises, but man did it
[590.82 → 596.12] look and this is what i want to know are people not learning everyone goes out and buys a rowing
[596.12 → 605.26] machine or a treadmill or an ice cream maker everybody does it, and they just keep doing it
[605.26 → 610.16] what's wrong with a rowing machine or a treadmill the fact that you use it six times what if someone
[610.16 → 616.02] does use it yeah, but those people are one in a thousand yeah that's true that's we have a
[616.02 → 623.44] chocolate fountain like those you'd see it like a party or a wedding yeah don't ask me why but
[623.44 → 627.70] how many times how many times did you guys use that we've never used it, but we've lent it out plenty of
[627.70 → 636.84] times so basically if jay's two cents doesn't end up working out for you then you're gonna start up a
[636.84 → 645.06] like pointless bullshit white people appliances rental house kitchen loans yeah yeah yeah there is
[645.06 → 651.02] probably a business there like my parents bought the uh bought the slicer machine
[651.02 → 658.80] the like V-shaped blade where you can like slice fries out of a potato and just like one thing um
[658.80 → 665.50] we had the bam ix which by the way did pay for itself in homemade mayonnaise you can make mayonnaise
[665.50 → 671.04] in like minutes with the bam ix I'm not trying to sell you the bam ix okay but um you know we had that
[671.04 → 676.94] one that is so i really didn't know there was that many people into homemade mayonnaise yeah i don't
[676.94 → 683.10] think there are a lot of people into it so much as there are um a few people that are really into it
[683.10 → 691.50] so that makes sense anyway my take on the home pod is okay it's got seven beam forming speakers
[691.50 → 695.58] and a four-inch subwoofer and uh apparently apple is
[695.58 → 702.82] really excited about the sound quality they're going after the Sonos play 3 with extra functionality
[702.82 → 707.88] if it does all this stuff really well then great but one of the things i love so much about Sonos
[707.88 → 715.38] is that whether I'm using an iPhone or an android device this week i can use it regardless so i have to
[715.38 → 721.44] see how apple again that's not a use case for like almost anybody well okay i can go over to my
[721.44 → 726.56] parents house and regardless of what kind of phone I'm using i can tap into Sonos and play some music
[726.56 → 731.04] which is pretty cool well how about the fact that the Sonos is also its own music server to you can
[731.04 → 735.16] just offload your favourites and create playlists on the Sonos on your own Sonos on your own network
[735.16 → 742.08] regardless of what devices are hooked up to it isn't it just speakers uh Sonos yeah no uh it's no
[742.08 → 746.96] like can it answer how tall is an average draft no it can't do that so then it's not really the
[746.96 → 754.56] same thing though but the logic being that if I'm going to buy an iPod or whatever their home pod um
[754.56 → 760.28] if I'm going to buy a home pod i probably already have one of these in my pocket now i get a lot of Sonos
[760.28 → 763.98] mail because I've signed up for their stuff like one of the few newsletters i actually pay attention
[763.98 → 769.82] to and i there was some early talk like late last year early this year about there being an assistant
[769.82 → 774.24] in development so i don't know if it's going to be a new assistant from Sonos probably wouldn't be very
[774.24 → 778.90] good considering what apple and google and Microsoft have been able to do in this long of a
[778.90 → 785.24] time but who knows um and considering how terrible everything is yeah yeah honestly i have no faith
[785.24 → 790.12] in a Sonos home assistant i just don't need a home assistant no, but you're not like here's the thing
[790.12 → 795.70] all these use cases for smart appliances let's talk smart appliances for a minute okay oh I'm gonna
[795.70 → 802.98] lose now okay all these use cases they're like yeah you can what is it you can your juicer needs to be
[802.98 → 807.28] connected to the internet you're you're also not gonna work like uh i forget who it was I think it
[807.28 → 811.64] was Samsung showing a smart washer and dryer yeah, and they're like yeah so you could like control
[811.64 → 817.66] your washer and dryer from a distance I'm like you mean instead of when i actually put the bloody
[817.66 → 823.86] clothes in yeah just getting notifications that your load is done could be helpful we have a LG
[823.86 → 831.10] smart refrigerator so okay, okay what's it what's it do why could why would I care it warns you like
[831.10 → 836.90] when the filters need to be changed if a door got left open if it's under temperature and a light on
[836.90 → 841.30] the front of the fridge couldn't do that well if the door got left open, and you're upstairs because
[841.30 → 847.44] you're going to bed again on the front of the fridge again eight-year-old child we have a have a piece
[847.44 → 852.12] of paper on our fridge at work saying please remember to close the fridge because that works
[852.12 → 858.00] for like two days to do it I'm just saying these things aren't completely useless and i think
[858.00 → 862.22] considering my comment about armies being more into google home and all right that kind of
[862.22 → 867.72] stuff the apple home pod might do better for them than the watch did so targeting people who can't
[867.72 → 872.52] figure out how to close their fridge no but at the same time as like like you say it's not going
[872.52 → 876.96] to be very helpful for you because you won't be chopping vegetables because you're not the one
[876.96 → 883.46] now ours doesn't at least go as far also whoa shots okay you go first jay but i have to address
[883.46 → 888.54] the shots fired over there okay ours is at least one of those that will like to tell you what
[888.54 → 893.06] you're low of in the fridge and automatically link it to your Amazon fresh cart and whatnot i mean we
[893.06 → 898.08] we do have the Amazon fresh like scanner thing my wife likes to use that, but there are refrigerators out
[898.08 → 901.96] there that will can tell when you're low on milk, and it will like automatically order it for you
[901.96 → 906.84] okay at least we didn't go that far i can, I could but i can actually see that being useful where's the
[906.84 → 910.66] more rudimentary stuff i don't know if i care as much about okay and back to your whole thing
[910.66 → 916.30] i don't need to convert metric to imperial because i actually already know these things
[916.30 → 924.58] teaspoon five mile tablespoon 15 mile i don't care one cup your conversions 250 mile a litter is
[924.58 → 930.56] approximately a quart it's a little more a gallon is four litres approximately it's about 3.75 litres
[930.56 → 937.86] okay i can convert this crap in my head i don't need an iPod i don't speak American so i need the help
[937.86 → 944.72] okay not everyone can and what if your kid asks you a question, and it's an of something super weird
[944.72 → 947.78] then I'm going to make it up because that's half the fun of being a parent
[947.78 → 958.40] daddy what does a giraffe do all day well son giraffes actually play a lot of poker people don't
[958.40 → 963.70] know this because you look at those hoops, and you think gee how do they even hold the cards
[963.70 → 971.16] but giraffes like see it's endless okay you know you make it up no problem my dad made things up to
[971.16 → 975.26] me and i turned out just fine I'd say that explains a lot
[975.26 → 987.86] Brandon is yelling debatable crap Brandon um all right let's talk about the new IMAX because i think
[987.86 → 997.98] basically this explains how AMD managed to remain so secretive about Vega because AMD leaks everything
[997.98 → 1004.38] but it seems like if you're going to collaborate with apple and apple wants to be the one to announce
[1004.38 → 1011.02] the first desktop you know Vega graphics card then people probably ran around the office going okay no
[1011.02 → 1017.84] for real this time for real this time don't leak Vega okay don't leak Vega apple wants to do it
[1017.84 → 1024.80] and if we don't sell them to apple we're not going to have a lot of customers so I'm salty about the
[1024.80 → 1031.46] whole thing okay all right so hit me okay so am AMD is kind of rebasing its whole foundation
[1031.46 → 1036.18] right of community oriented gamer oriented, and we've been waiting for Vega for quite a while
[1036.18 → 1041.58] right but i feel a little bit stabbed to the back by AMD that they're launching it in an apple product
[1041.58 → 1046.60] first i mean that's kind of where I'm at with that so when the news came out i basically just kind
[1046.60 → 1051.50] of like facepalmed and then turned it off because at that point i just felt like i just felt like AMD
[1051.50 → 1056.82] sold out on that one now it's no it's no news that AMD graphics have been in macBook pros and that for
[1056.82 → 1061.88] a while but i just feel i just feel like the Vega that everyone's been waiting for
[1061.88 → 1067.84] kind of going to aim or apple first was and i don't like it either but I'll I'm willing to give
[1067.84 → 1073.74] them a little bit of benefit of the doubt listening to what you're saying i hear that, but we all know
[1073.74 → 1078.62] that they need as much money as possible so if there was some amount of like they're going to
[1078.62 → 1084.16] make more from this if there's some amount of temporary exclusivity deal or something than I'm
[1084.16 → 1088.24] willing to give it to them because like if it's only if it's only Vega pro then i guess that kind of
[1088.24 → 1091.72] makes sense but i mean we're still waiting for more kind of gamer or mainstream Vega but
[1091.72 → 1098.12] still that's fair right now to my knowledge apple is the only tier one computer maker
[1098.12 → 1108.68] that not forget about being exclusive to AMD Radeon apple is the only tier one pc maker that even
[1108.68 → 1116.18] emphasizes AMD Radeon so i do understand why apple is getting some special treatment here because
[1116.18 → 1121.70] even like so i got a press release today that acer is doing like a 799 budget gaming desktop
[1121.70 → 1127.82] i was actually thinking yeah we might actually pull it in for review because it's uh, uh it's dozen
[1127.82 → 1136.46] based okay yeah they still put a 1050 in it wow, and it's just like okay, so part of the problem is
[1136.46 → 1142.38] that supply is really tight on the Rx cards because cryptocurrency mining is again uh super important
[1142.38 → 1149.58] again came back around but part of it too is that like they're competitive, but they're they're not like
[1149.58 → 1155.58] uh they're not like a know a green team crushing solution at any level in the product stack
[1155.58 → 1163.04] that's what shad is so salty that you said tier one what tier one is like a's a term you can define
[1163.04 → 1171.42] i know it's not it's not an opinion so upset i mean they're going to hate who the rest of the tier ones are
[1171.42 → 1180.60] okay dell hp Lenovo what did you think what did you think i was going to say like Asus MSI
[1180.60 → 1188.84] I'm sorry those guys okay those guys are tier one motherboard manufacturers
[1188.84 → 1199.00] yeah but in the pc system space all the enterprise they are way behind okay I'm sorry get over it
[1199.00 → 1208.38] um so let's talk a little bit about the device that Vega graphics are going into um i may do a
[1208.38 → 1213.66] dedicated video on this actually just kind of discussing this, but jay hit me with your thoughts
[1213.66 → 1222.90] on an iMac Pro um okay so should i do some approximate specs for the viewers before
[1222.90 → 1228.28] you kind of launch into it or yeah because i was kind of pulling up something sure okay so let's let's do
[1228.28 → 1235.46] some context for you guys so much like the mac pro this is a ball to the wall machine we're talking
[1235.46 → 1243.92] up to 18 core Leon we're talking up to 128 gigs of ECC ram we're talking radon Vega graphics a 5k
[1243.92 → 1251.18] display four thunderbolt 3 ports with support for external GPUs so that Vega GPU however they're
[1251.18 → 1258.06] implementing it whether it's mm or whether it's baked right into the PCB um is upgradable in a manner of
[1258.06 → 1265.70] speaking up to a 4 terabyte SSD a 10-bit panel new black peripherals because that's important uh
[1265.70 → 1273.78] uh uhs2 SDD card slot might be into the home pod enough it is 500 watt power supply 1080p webcam
[1273.78 → 1280.90] starting at five thousand dollars i mean this to me looks like a pretty bananas machine
[1280.90 → 1289.02] but it's in an all-in-one yeah uh I'm a little surprised that they spent so much emphasis on
[1289.02 → 1293.22] specs because given kind of where they've been over like let's just say the last eight years
[1293.22 → 1301.10] um i mean you can still buy an i7 dual-core right MacBook Pro so it just seems it just seems kind of
[1301.10 → 1305.96] surprising to me that they actually are going with the top tier hardware this time around because apple's
[1305.96 → 1311.22] always been about software um optimizations right yes so I'm kind of wondering experience you buy a
[1311.22 → 1316.58] product not a spec sheet right i mean given the experience given the price to specs i don't think
[1316.58 → 1320.92] and the fact that it's apple i actually don't think that that price is really like out of whack i think
[1320.92 → 1324.74] it's right in line with where it should be because you could build a similar intel based system with
[1324.74 → 1330.70] the same specs and spend just as much yeah and that's that's true depending though on what we are
[1330.70 → 1337.26] actually getting for five grand because that might be maybe that's not Vega and maybe that's i mean
[1337.26 → 1341.04] it's certainly not an 18 right because it does say it starts it does say it starts with
[1341.04 → 1347.08] the eight cores Zion so that would be maybe is it eight core is doing it have eight gigs of ram right
[1347.08 → 1352.56] like we don't roll up to 15k yeah you never know how much apple's going to kneecap something honestly
[1352.56 → 1357.72] for me the thing that I'm that i really take exception with and the thing that again i might do like
[1357.72 → 1364.64] some kind of follow-up video on here is that they're that they're calling it pro that
[1364.64 → 1372.44] people that the pro users got upset when they took away the tower that you can put expansion cards in
[1372.44 → 1381.44] and they gave us a cylinder that you can clip that you can plug expansion devices into and that now
[1381.44 → 1386.56] you know and they did say earlier this year that they're going to have something to address the pro user
[1386.56 → 1394.04] i guess what i want to know it was this it because to me professional means modular
[1394.04 → 1401.04] upgradable it is means a path to continue using it and the other thing that really upsets me and that
[1401.04 → 1409.06] makes that makes apple's desktop ecosystem almost impossible to support as a business owner is the
[1409.06 → 1415.28] unpredictability of it yeah if we go back for the last 10 years so we just upgraded our editing
[1415.28 → 1419.48] workstations it was kind of time it had been three almost four years something like that
[1419.48 → 1427.68] and so let's say over a span of 10 years if our company were to have followed a typical upgrade
[1427.68 → 1434.68] cycle of three to four years we would have had towers we would have had cylinders we would have
[1434.68 → 1440.24] been stuck with old cylinders thinking holy crap are we going to have to just go straight to laptops
[1440.24 → 1446.52] and then apple would have dumped an AI o on us with that hold on a second i mean what if we just
[1446.52 → 1452.84] upgraded our displays apparently no the new pro version is coming probably sometime in 2018 okay
[1452.84 → 1458.50] which still doesn't address my fundamental problem with apple not having a clear strategy
[1458.50 → 1464.94] in a professional environment i need to know what my upgrade path is right so that if I'm going to
[1464.94 → 1471.44] invest in a bunch of brand new 8k displays from dell let's say exactly i need to know that the new
[1471.44 → 1477.46] machine that I'm going to have available to me is going to make any sense oh wait oh this one comes
[1477.46 → 1485.40] with uh with a display already in it like i just i don't understand apple's pro lineup um so
[1485.40 → 1489.64] that's kind of where I'm that's kind of where I'm going with that is this the first iMac Pro though
[1489.64 → 1495.02] I'm not sure yes it is i think so okay yep so they're just they're just introducing then the
[1495.02 → 1499.80] new pro line of iMacs but for the so then okay based on the hardware available in the iMac are you
[1499.80 → 1505.14] is the new MacBook Pro or excuse me the new mac pro coming out in 2018 going to be essentially the
[1505.14 → 1509.34] same hardware in a tower format with AI o water cooling again i mean i have to kind of wonder what
[1509.34 → 1515.48] the next tier of hardware could be i kind of wonder too like i would love for apple to just go
[1515.48 → 1522.56] straight back to basics here's a tower here's where the expansion cards go here's how you add
[1522.56 → 1527.92] a freaking hard drive that's connected to a SATA interface instead of connected to a thunderbolt
[1527.92 → 1532.14] interface for some reason their desktop side of their enterprise has always been more concerned
[1532.14 → 1533.72] with the form factor than anything else
[1533.72 → 1543.84] yeah so i don't know that's that's where I'm at on that I'm glad that they do have a legitimate
[1543.84 → 1551.94] professional you know high-end great option but um I'm I'm frustrated that pro products are being
[1551.94 → 1553.58] treated as basically disposable
[1553.58 → 1562.48] other than being able to upgrade the graphics which is good but the fact that we're doing this over
[1562.48 → 1568.52] thunderbolt means that there is going to be some kind of bottleneck that exists already and can only
[1568.52 → 1574.08] get worse so we did a fairly thorough i think investigation where we looked at alienware's
[1574.08 → 1582.10] graphics amplifier versus the razor core and found that already with a top tier 1080 ti there are
[1582.10 → 1587.50] performance differences between a straight PCIE interface and thunderbolt 3 with all the extra
[1587.50 → 1593.62] overhead and people criticized us they said well Linus no one's going to put a 1080 ti in that thing
[1593.62 → 1598.38] and I'm sitting here going well that wasn't the point is that three years from now when
[1598.38 → 1603.32] it is time to upgrade your graphics card something with the power of a 1080 ti is going to cost 199
[1603.32 → 1609.82] yeah and that's exactly what you're going to put in it yeah well i played around thunderbolt 3 for the
[1609.82 → 1615.44] first time earlier this year with you know the external graphics card solutions and i saw the same
[1615.44 → 1619.36] thing you did in fact it was so the performance degradation was so bad over even thunderbolt 3
[1619.36 → 1626.06] that i had to get confirmation that the anywhere between 25 and 35 performance loss was normal and
[1626.06 → 1630.78] i said oh yeah that's normal okay then what's the point of buying top tier graphics like this when
[1630.78 → 1636.48] it's just going to be dumb down to a tier or two lower on the graphics solutions so like you're
[1636.48 → 1640.32] saying though if using an interface like that is the option to stay forward compatible then you're
[1640.32 → 1644.24] just cutting yourself off at the knees and the ankles and everything as you go forward one note about
[1644.24 → 1648.20] this new iMac i don't know what versions i know there's the pro and i believe there's non-pro new
[1648.20 → 1652.28] versions the only thing I've seen is of the non-pro but I'm assuming it's the same for both
[1652.28 → 1658.60] the CPU and the ram are both replaceable yep that was true of previous iMacs but not GPU still but
[1658.60 → 1666.20] not like we're talking about anyway okay so that's frustrating um and i kind of doubt people are
[1666.20 → 1671.90] going to be super hardcore throttled by at least the CPU part of that you might be able to get away with
[1671.90 → 1675.90] the classic mac thing where you buy the one with less ram and then upgrade the ram yourself because it's
[1675.90 → 1682.64] way freaking cheaper but who knows i don't know it's interesting yeah so i don't know i still
[1682.64 → 1686.76] haven't decided if I'm going to do a piece on it is kind of depends whether i can sort of come up with
[1686.76 → 1690.78] a coherent enough argument but it is something that I've wanted to talk about for quite some time
[1690.78 → 1697.90] apple's sort of schizophrenic approach to professional products' studio versus mac pro oh Lord i don't well
[1697.90 → 1707.32] i don't necessarily so it's too early in the surface product uh lineup yeah for me to really talk about
[1707.32 → 1713.04] you know uh Microsoft strategy because right now it's really hard to tell what it is i can't discuss
[1713.04 → 1719.98] um one creator family whatever that really means yeah whatever creator means i mean this thing spanks
[1719.98 → 1725.34] the surface studio on paper anyway performance wise definitely yeah and degradability wise even
[1725.34 → 1732.78] yeah the surface studio is horrible nightmare to get into yeah um so should we do the big announcement
[1732.78 → 1738.22] the reason that jay's on the show today oh yeah should we do that now actually you know what
[1738.22 → 1744.84] no what we're going to do is do it after the ads okay so why don't we uh why don't we do our sponsor
[1744.84 → 1749.42] call-outs first yeah um hold on i just want to do uh i want to do a quick tweet do you want to start
[1749.42 → 1754.50] one of them and then uh jade should be just we'll just uh we'll just put you away for now okay I'll
[1754.50 → 1760.26] I'll duck out of the way okay cool uh I'm gonna conveniently start with savage jerky yeah dog
[1760.26 → 1767.38] dog can I have some which is this a new box this is not a new box I'm oh okay uh oh yeah probably i
[1767.38 → 1773.14] mean how does jerky go bad yeah okay should I take on the reaper today what did you do last time i don't
[1773.14 → 1779.44] remember i think i did the second hottest one that like has more that's five bars uh yeah the
[1779.44 → 1784.24] reaper's five bars so savage jerky fairly self-explanatory it's its it's jerky or you can get
[1784.24 → 1789.38] bacon actually make maple bacon that's mine you don't get any maple bacon get wrecked where's my
[1789.38 → 1796.08] favourite one I'm going to do the do we have a Carolina reaper that's already open um there we go there we go
[1796.08 → 1802.32] yeah we got an open one this one's not as popular just to eat for loss because it uh
[1802.32 → 1806.46] oh no we don't have an open one i don't think we've done this one since the last spot because
[1806.46 → 1812.86] if you're into spicy jerky this is like for you crazy I'm not that into spicy jerky there we go
[1812.86 → 1819.26] mojo habanero that's my favourite one they all come with generally four bars of heat on the front so to
[1819.26 → 1825.72] tell you how hot it is mojo habanero is a three the reaper is special it comes with five bars and
[1825.72 → 1831.74] they're all filled because it is just more hot than freaking anything savage jerky is a sponsor of ours
[1831.74 → 1837.14] they use the best ingredients without nitrates or preservatives um their goal is to create a
[1837.14 → 1842.28] snack that is full of flavour and spice and won't actually be bad for you apparently their inspiration
[1842.28 → 1847.64] came from the flavour of garlic lime and cilantro i believe that you can taste it in almost all of
[1847.64 → 1851.92] them if you can still if you still have taste buds that work yeah if you go for the reaper you might
[1851.92 → 1856.24] want to taste it for long they'll taste it for a little bit at the start, and then it goes away i don't
[1856.24 → 1862.26] fear the reaper or the wind or the rain we can be like they are come on baby apparently outside
[1862.26 → 1867.78] this just the traditional flavours most people go for sriracha bacon or maple buffalo bacon which makes
[1867.78 → 1873.08] sense so good Linus's preferences but yeah they're pretty freaking good they have a bunch of
[1873.08 → 1877.08] different flavours they're really into the spicy stuff and savage if you're into that so you can check
[1877.08 → 1883.76] them out over at savage jerky.com and uh once i figure out how to get the package open because apparently
[1883.76 → 1889.70] they don't have stupid people proof packaging and i mean I've I've opened them all flawlessly but
[1889.70 → 1895.16] anyway you know what I've had enough of your crap what the heck if you use offer code lap you'll so
[1895.16 → 1903.12] you'll save 10 on your order which is okay so now i get to do the other two ad spots with some pain
[1903.12 → 1913.90] heck yeah okay well join cable mods cable dodders group on Facebook and enter
[1913.90 → 1921.66] for a chance to win um i took it to Ltd oh yeah okay maybe you better do this

[2155.04 → 2161.62] for all the episodes did you take away my bacon no where did my bacon go never take a man's bacon
[2161.62 → 2166.08] no that oh wait yeah that is the buffalo okay I'm not upset anymore okay, okay carry on sorry i was
[2166.08 → 2171.00] about to get real angry because i thought my bacon jerky was gone okay carry on jay no i think
[2171.00 → 2175.36] it's funny because uh i think ed put the credits up right after the first episode i think the credits
[2175.36 → 2180.80] were up and showed me there um yep right next to Jonathan who uh because it said in their thanks for
[2180.80 → 2186.16] loaning equipment when we needed it and other uh stuff right and some folks there's some pretty sharp
[2186.16 → 2189.60] people out there in the audience, and they were like oh i guess we know who the celebrity judge is and i was
[2189.60 → 2193.72] like no clearly i loaned them equipment that's why I'm down here and ed like that tweet he's
[2193.72 → 2197.28] like oh yeah because i was trying to i this is probably the hardest secret i ever kept we're like
[2197.28 → 2203.60] what three months like three months past this it's been um yeah so i was the guest celebrity judge
[2203.60 → 2212.20] on the RGB factor uh-huh so uh scrapyard wars episode four have you seen it yet i have you have okay
[2212.20 → 2219.36] okay so you got early access to it so scrapyard wars episode four is coming this weekend
[2219.36 → 2226.40] i think it's going to be on Sunday and uh without any spoilers i think it's fair to say this
[2226.40 → 2239.86] jay is a very impactful member of the cast for the fourth and final episode he not only you know
[2239.86 → 2246.74] did what he did as our celebrity guest he also lent us his studio space which was very generous and he
[2246.74 → 2252.22] hung out with us until the wee hours of the morning because how many messages did I send you
[2252.22 → 2256.66] saying yeah hey we're not coming, yet it's going to be later hey actually it's going to be later
[2256.66 → 2264.62] can we just stand around for a little while i i i i think it is an opportunity to sit on the couch
[2264.62 → 2268.92] here and watch some TV and some Netflix something i never get to do because i cleaned the studio right
[2268.92 → 2272.24] i was like okay i want a fresh slate for you guys to be able to set up however you want it to you
[2272.24 → 2276.16] know take rein of the space and i only moved in two weeks prior to that so it was pretty empty
[2276.16 → 2279.64] right compared to now like you have to you have to walk sideways to go down the hallway but
[2279.64 → 2286.38] yeah um no it was it was fun because i got to see scrapyard wars for the first time literally
[2286.38 → 2292.82] from the finale backwards because it's like okay i see how it ends i know how it ends but i have no
[2292.82 → 2297.12] idea how we got here so it was really weird even for me, you know because i knew you kept sending
[2297.12 → 2300.50] these texts like we're delayed we're sorry we're delayed we're sorry and I'm just like oh my god what is
[2300.50 → 2303.62] going on over there I'm thinking this better make for some good drama, and it didn't disappoint
[2303.62 → 2309.88] so for those of you who want to watch scrapyard wars episode four early I'm actually posting a
[2309.88 → 2315.64] link in the chat float plane club is um our early access platform that we've got over on the Linus
[2315.64 → 2319.88] tech tips' forum that we would love to open up to other creators at some point
[2319.88 → 2330.12] sorry i think some of those costs are legitimate because the jerky
[2330.12 → 2334.98] not all of them, but this is the maple bacon jerky oh okay no this stuff's fine
[2334.98 → 2339.00] yeah um only the worst of content creators would consider such a platform
[2339.00 → 2343.04] yeah early access it does nothing but hurt the audience
[2343.04 → 2349.16] except when they don't notice that it's happening yeah except when that happens yeah uh also you
[2349.16 → 2352.96] know it kind of helps the creator there is the whole Apocalypse thing going on
[2352.96 → 2358.58] yeah that's i don't know if anybody noticed that yeah um all right okay, but that's literally
[2358.58 → 2362.82] killing should we get back to maybe about 10 more minutes of news and then um we'll bid adieu
[2362.82 → 2370.30] to jay and bring on Nicky v for one final land show stream yeah do it um actually okay we kind
[2370.30 → 2376.50] of touched on this, but this is sort of uh sort of big deal AMD's GPU supply exhausted by
[2376.50 → 2381.90] cryptocurrency so I'll go ahead and screen share here real quick here so if you've been running out
[2381.90 → 2389.52] there trying to buy a Rx 470 or r excuse me 570 sorry any of them honestly Freudian slip
[2389.52 → 2397.74] a 570 or a 580 um yeah you've probably had a bit of a hard time because people are let's see
[2397.74 → 2402.64] let's have a look at what this stuff is so what are these coins i don't even know have you been
[2402.64 → 2407.34] keeping up with this jay only a little bit oh see i realized it was starting to pick back up
[2407.34 → 2411.18] in popularity when it was becoming difficult to source this because I'm I'm getting to the point
[2411.18 → 2415.04] where I'm just kind of buying and building the systems on my own right and not taking sponsorship
[2415.04 → 2421.44] on everything so i went and tried to legitimately buy these for a video and I'm like i can't get
[2421.44 → 2426.30] any Rx based graphics card 400 or 500 series uh, and it was just like what the heck so i started
[2426.30 → 2430.42] researching it, and it seems like we've gone full circle right because at the beginning everyone
[2430.42 → 2435.42] wanted less power consumption and they wanted the out of camera with what it's actually called
[2435.42 → 2440.22] when they do the hashing or whatever right, and they wanted um they wanted more efficiency on that so
[2440.22 → 2444.18] they kind of started coming across with these custom-built computers i think Jerry did a really
[2444.18 → 2449.20] good video about uh you know the progression of bitcoin mining and then i don't understand how we
[2449.20 → 2454.98] got back to here though well it looks like it's Ethereum mining that people are really into right now
[2454.98 → 2462.02] Ethereum okay yeah so um i actually had someone internally pitching to me that we should do a bitcoin
[2462.02 → 2467.80] mining update and i was like not bitcoin but cryptocurrency mining update and i was like oh really that again
[2467.80 → 2471.26] and i didn't really look into it, i really should have because then we could have been a little bit
[2471.26 → 2476.62] more uh more topical on it pretty huge yeah but there you go what's what's happening again bitcoin
[2476.62 → 2482.90] right now because no matter what people are mining their all converting it out anyway so yeah bitcoin
[2482.90 → 2489.30] is equal to 3,794 Canadian dollars, so there's a big gold rush again basically yeah i can try to find
[2489.30 → 2494.44] us dollars which is that's one whole bitcoin right because i think they also you get them in bits
[2494.44 → 2502.84] right yes you get partial so it's 2,824 is us dollars per bitcoin which is huge if you can see
[2502.84 → 2510.08] the here hold on what did you search um just one BTC to USD so I'm going to go ahead and share that with
[2510.08 → 2517.50] the audience here yeah so there you go the charts you can see you can see the big yeah you can see it
[2517.50 → 2526.02] pop up big gold rush back in 2014 late 2013 early 2014 no sorry that was mid 2014 yeah, and it was
[2526.02 → 2532.02] across the thousand, and it was news mm-hmm and then in the last since the end of last year it's
[2532.02 → 2538.38] gone from like 500 bucks to over 2,000, and it's its very close to over 3k which is pretty insane
[2538.38 → 2547.98] yeah pretty incredible so once again I've missed out once again i suck at everything but I'm I'm over
[2547.98 → 2556.78] it uh what else we got here um PCI Express 4.0 specs finalized the original articles from tech report
[2556.78 → 2565.62] and also in other news PCI Express 5.0 is announced hooray so it's going to be 16 gig transfers per second
[2565.62 → 2577.20] on tap so basically we're doubling it again um so that's really important on the server side of
[2577.20 → 2583.18] things and less important for consumers yeah i mean i guess it's cool in the sense that like
[2583.18 → 2588.90] consumer platforms that don't have as many PCI e lanes will be able to run like i mean at this point
[2588.90 → 2596.84] you're going to be able to run in what a 1x slot or like a 4x slot what you used to be able
[2596.84 → 2602.04] to run in a hold on a second so that would be a 8x a 16 okay hold on a second you're going to be
[2602.04 → 2606.22] able to run in like a 2x slot which i believe does exist but no one implements it if i recall correctly
[2606.22 → 2612.46] what you would have been able to run in a 16x slot back in gen 1 so that's that's cool right it's
[2612.46 → 2618.46] pretty cool that's cool are we excited throwing stuff into big 16x slot things isn't really going to be a
[2618.46 → 2626.16] big difference though um yeah so it still needs to undergo a final review but um scale of 1 to 10
[2626.16 → 2634.58] jay how excited eh i mean i don't do my workflow doesn't really matter that much on PCI throughput
[2634.58 → 2641.74] but yeah is there a timeline on that um well right now it still needs a couple little things um one big
[2641.74 → 2649.12] question is whether AMD and intel will even bother to implement PCIE gen 4 on consumer parts
[2649.12 → 2656.50] in which case yeah the timeline could be who knows yeah um on the server side of things though PCIE gen
[2656.50 → 2663.28] 5 which will double it again uh designed to offer 128 gigabytes per second of total bandwidth will
[2663.28 → 2670.38] allow us to have 400 gigabits per second Ethernet solutions so like that's super sick that's cool
[2670.38 → 2678.08] so that's like amazing yeah um oh this is fun we're already like we have like no contact at Samsung
[2678.08 → 2684.80] whatsoever because we suck um, but we saw this earlier this morning we were like yeah need to get our
[2684.80 → 2691.80] hands on some of that Samsung announced i think it's a 32 by 1 32 by 9 sorry uh wide aspect ratio
[2691.80 → 2696.36] monitor have you seen this have you heard about this yeah it's like three four by threes yeah
[2696.36 → 2705.26] that's ridiculous it that's that is curved right yeah it is yeah with free sync yeah for gamers
[2705.26 → 2715.62] that's pretty wild 144 hertz 1 ms response time HDR 10 free sync 2 quantum dot all the things all the
[2715.62 → 2723.00] all the buzzwords Samsung's one of those companies where like they have world-class display technology
[2723.00 → 2730.40] and just no idea yeah like i stopped by their booth i think it was like two CES's ago and they
[2730.40 → 2737.08] were showing off like a free sync monitor, and they didn't have the refresh rate and nobody in the whole
[2737.08 → 2741.96] booth i swear i asked like eight people including like the guy who was in charge of the monitor section
[2741.96 → 2748.86] knew the refresh rate and I'm just like you know that's actually like the important spec
[2748.86 → 2753.24] well it's kind of like monitor right now it's kind of like when i was shopping at uh fries electronics
[2753.24 → 2757.34] i don't know if you guys have those up there but fries is a big electronic store here in the states and
[2757.34 → 2760.92] yeah uh i was shopping for panels and i was looking at high refresh rate stuff
[2760.92 → 2767.10] and they had them all hooked up to HDMI so it was like not a single panel was actually displaying
[2767.10 → 2771.50] anything towards like what it possibly could and when i tried to explain to the manager of
[2771.50 → 2775.66] that section i was like you need to put display ports on these uh he was like no it's HDMI it's
[2775.66 → 2782.88] fine it carries audio too I'm like yeah so basically not the point dude my wife was with me on that one
[2782.88 → 2786.42] and even she knew more, and she like doesn't care about any of this stuff she was like yeah i don't
[2786.42 → 2793.76] think that's supposed to look that way oh man terrible all right last one before we bring on Nicky v
[2793.76 → 2801.10] uh intel coffee lake CPUs delayed so the rumour that intel is going to be releasing
[2801.10 → 2808.28] six and four core coffee lakes uh processors on their mainstream platform
[2808.28 → 2814.76] uh this year it seems to have been quashed it will instead be apparently and this is all rumours um
[2814.76 → 2821.52] sometime in february 2018 can you imagine how much of a better position intel would be in today
[2821.52 → 2829.76] if they had brought six core before AMD launched dozen yeah if kb lake was six core
[2829.76 → 2834.96] i think they could have, but they got very complacent over the last decade on their
[2834.96 → 2840.44] own roadmap, and they just kept pushing stuff off i think this should begin the Linus and jay collab
[2840.44 → 2847.66] angry session the angry the anger the 299 talk i want to i want to say something real quick
[2847.66 → 2853.12] i took a lot of flack like oh just copying Linus because he had a viral video i said that day in
[2853.12 → 2857.72] computer i looked at nick and i said Monday we're recording this we're recording my thoughts on this
[2857.72 → 2862.42] this is days before you and i ever talked about it and before your video ever went up the difference
[2862.42 → 2866.80] is you took advantage of walking in the rain you took advantage of walking in the rain you went for
[2866.80 → 2871.80] that whole like depressing I'm surprised that whoever edited that video didn't put a gray hue on there too
[2871.80 → 2875.94] and just make it super depressing but i saw that video and i was like your son of a bitch
[2875.94 → 2884.04] but no i i i had to do it anyway um i mean there are so many things you can talk about right
[2884.04 → 2887.86] i mean i shot that video like four times because i kept kind of dubbing it down i was like i was
[2887.86 → 2892.36] rambling so long on that and there are so many things that are wrong with that all the way down to
[2892.36 → 2900.94] uh a paywall for raid i mean what the hell man i just i like that one i don't even know because like
[2900.94 → 2906.60] I'll tell you this like even on the server side so i recently rolled out a NVMe storage server
[2906.60 → 2914.58] so it's got 48 NVMe bays and i actually had some issues with intel's RST enterprise drivers
[2914.58 → 2922.02] where it's limited to maximum 12 drives and that was just like a tech limitation that was like a driver
[2922.02 → 2926.02] limitation it wasn't like a paywall thing they weren't asking for anything it just straighten up
[2926.02 → 2934.26] had no way to do that um and i actually wanted to run cheapo rate raid 5 on that high speed NAS
[2934.26 → 2941.32] and the reason for that is that I'm doing real-time replication of that NAS to a separate box so
[2941.32 → 2947.00] ultimately if i only have one drive of redundancy or it just kind of craps the bed I'm going to switch
[2947.00 → 2950.08] everybody over we're going to be editing off the other box while i rebuild it and get everything i
[2950.08 → 2955.46] mean it'll be inconvenient, but it's not the end of the world yeah so i couldn't do that because of
[2955.46 → 2960.52] like a driver limitation well now I'm wondering if I'm not going to be able to do that unless i buy
[2960.52 → 2966.30] an expensive dongle yeah because if they're doing it on x299 yeah get like two more minutes uh if
[2966.30 → 2970.10] they're doing it on x299 then they're probably going to do it on the server side too right
[2970.10 → 2975.42] i guess they could probably go both ways right if you're is you're already paying the enterprise
[2975.42 → 2981.34] solutions on on the server side of things maybe it would be implemented but then again that kind
[2981.34 → 2986.30] of sucks too i mean because then you're talking about double standards in terms of their of
[2986.30 → 2992.06] their just uh their mentality regarding how they want to implement and roll out this stuff to
[2992.06 → 2997.38] me this honestly feels like they just were caught off guard by a lot of things happening in the
[2997.38 → 3003.62] industry right now and i feel like what has kind of flipped on them a little bit is their official
[3003.62 → 3007.60] response regarding dozen was they felt like the consumers are going to take a wait and see mentality
[3007.60 → 3011.82] regarding how well they want to adopt dozen i think i feel like everyone jumped on dozen and
[3011.82 → 3018.08] now everyone wants to wait and see with intel yep because and that is such an ignorant like why would
[3018.08 → 3022.58] why would people wait and see wait and see what you're either building a computer or you're not
[3022.58 → 3027.42] yeah and of course dozen like every other new launch had some growing pains in the start but so
[3027.42 → 3032.18] did x99 you know, and so i mean it's one of those things where like today and that was a big thing i
[3032.18 → 3036.36] asked a lot of the motherboard manufacturers and ODMs out there at computer was
[3036.36 → 3040.70] are things better on dozen now, and they all really assured me like yeah things have matured the
[3040.70 → 3046.72] drivers are good the memory stability and support is there um compatibility is good and they
[3046.72 → 3051.22] basically were telling me like hey you should maybe try out dozen a bit again because i
[3051.22 → 3055.34] did it for the first 30 days at lunch had a couple of weird idiosyncrasies there but then i just
[3055.34 → 3060.32] kind of moved on to my intel system which is already together and i use it for work yeah but i find
[3060.32 → 3065.74] myself now like okay i should probably i should probably take another crack at it but i would
[3065.74 → 3070.70] love to see the thread ripper stuff only because like just like your workflow it's like i would I
[3070.70 → 3076.26] could take advantage of all those cores yeah um but even the 1800x is a good is a good place to
[3076.26 → 3082.84] look at for absolutely cheap enterprise solution i wouldn't convert all of our editing machines over
[3082.84 → 3087.66] anytime soon just because like i mean you know what we're going to have a video coming out where we roll
[3087.66 → 3094.96] all of our editing machines up to 10 core uh 69 50 x's and already on our early access people are
[3094.96 → 3100.14] like yo what the heck intel has new stuff what about thread ripper what about this what about that
[3100.14 → 3107.16] stability is important and I'm I've responded there and I'll respond proactively now to everybody else
[3107.16 → 3116.58] um it is no coincidence that about six months or four months before x99 launched all our editing
[3116.58 → 3123.80] machines moved to 49 60 x's on x79 yeah there is something to be said for something that is
[3123.80 → 3130.66] powerful enough and has had three years to work out all the potential issues when you're talking about
[3130.66 → 3138.20] a workstation for what we do for what we do maturity is way better for us than just raw power and cutting
[3138.20 → 3141.88] edge bleeding edge technology they call it bleeding edge for a reason yeah and if it was for myself
[3141.88 → 3147.00] no problem I'll run whatever random crap beta drivers whatever but if i have a room of not
[3147.00 → 3150.74] necessarily techie people that are going to come to me every time there's an issue with it yeah
[3150.74 → 3156.64] no man i like this is your 50 x isn't new either uh no it's not that's exactly immediately when
[3156.64 → 3162.02] it launched I'm doing exactly the same thing yeah I'm going at the end of the platform cycle yeah and
[3162.02 → 3168.60] i have no problem with that out of curiosity um what's your take on 6950x versus 7900k then
[3168.60 → 3177.54] or excuse me 6900k so any particular reason the XQ um because the whole upgrade was sponsored by intel
[3177.54 → 3182.94] and if i can ask for anything i want i might as well take the 6950x it does perform in my benchmarking
[3182.94 → 3187.26] i did a whole video on this a while back marginally better got it
[3187.26 → 3195.46] margin plus you just x just sounds cooler yeah that's why they have x on all the new ones
[3195.46 → 3201.16] anyway thanks jay um i have to give the people what they want guys if you love jay then you can
[3201.16 → 3207.72] check him out over at YouTube.com slash jays two cents that's j with a z not to be confused with j z
[3207.72 → 3217.80] that guy has a dash jays does not um also over on Twitter at uh at angry tech man who's who's salty
[3217.80 → 3222.12] about stuff no wait what is your twitter handle again it's at jays two cents right yeah I'm
[3222.12 → 3229.86] cross-branded properly hey I've had enough of your crap man all right anyway, so guys go check out j
[3229.86 → 3233.86] over there thanks j for coming on the show and I'm sorry i have to kind of kick you off everyone watch
[3233.86 → 3237.60] episode four go yes do that all right thanks for having me
[3237.60 → 3241.74] okay thanks man I'm just going to hang up no problem
[3241.74 → 3256.68] book all right, so this is it my friends this is your last chance for q a with the one the only
[3256.68 → 3266.30] Nicky v who has some of his uh civic cake with him, so this was a was a parting gift for
[3266.30 → 3272.08] the one and only Nicky v it's his last day today it's an uh it's a cake in the shape of the
[3272.08 → 3278.42] civic it looks pretty good it's a very good recreation homemade Yvonne homemade yeah, and it's good cake too
[3278.42 → 3286.06] except one minor detail that i can't leave out yes these tires these are brown, and you know that the
[3286.06 → 3291.50] rims on that thing are orange but i noticed i saw a recent picture that your civic uh rims are looking
[3291.50 → 3297.24] a little faded these days i don't think we did enough coats the rims are a little faded the
[3297.24 → 3301.28] know want to know something funny about the civic what how long do you think it's been since we painted
[3301.28 → 3308.56] it uh it was in the spring i think no i don't know maybe a year and a half year okay so um
[3308.56 → 3317.40] we moved in here i think two years ago so it's been almost two years that's a long time that car
[3317.40 → 3325.14] has not been washed yeah inside or out oh i know inside in that time so if the paint were to be
[3325.14 → 3331.36] damaged or faded wow it makes sense then, but you know what i think maybe that maybe the rims
[3331.36 → 3335.70] aren't fading though maybe they're just covered in dirt but how are those windshield wipers holding up
[3335.70 → 3340.28] they are most excellent they're most excellent well there you go okay we got the questions
[3340.28 → 3345.76] rolling in who is going to prank Dennis now who are you handing the mantle over to i would say
[3345.76 → 3350.08] who's got the capability i think you have the pranking capability, but you don't have the time
[3350.08 → 3357.22] i think Colton has the time but doesn't have the ability maybe Colton maybe he's the next prankster
[3357.22 → 3362.26] but i don't know i think there's some people who could set up a pretty good prank all right and of
[3362.26 → 3366.66] course the number one question we'll get this out of the way, so people ask other questions where
[3366.66 → 3375.40] are you going i am going to the Linus tech tips of biking called pinkbike.com it's like if you didn't
[3375.40 → 3379.32] know what bike like if you weren't really a mountain biker anything you probably wouldn't know about it
[3379.32 → 3384.42] but if you had stepped foot on a mountain biker if you've ever bought one or anything like that it is
[3384.42 → 3389.62] like the hub it's like the only source there are other websites, but this is sort of the OG
[3389.62 → 3396.62] gangster ass website that started in Calgary and then kind of like grew as the sport became a sport
[3396.62 → 3402.10] from nothing so pretty, pretty awesome, so this is as much a question from me as anyone else what exactly
[3402.10 → 3408.48] will you be doing there I'll be uh making videos um I'll be running around with a guy named Brett hippy
[3408.48 → 3415.38] he's like i would say the only person i know that is comparable in energy level to you, i would have
[3415.38 → 3422.34] i would run a poll like if people who know who knew both people i don't know who has
[3422.34 → 3427.62] more energy you or him so it would be it would be a pretty good uh pretty good battle but uh I'll
[3427.62 → 3433.56] be making videos and doing some web content and stuff for them and uh you know all things biking just
[3433.56 → 3440.00] trying to uh share my love of biking with the world you know so I'm pretty excited we've got someone
[3440.00 → 3446.38] asking will you collab will I collab there's not a lot of overlap but i don't think it's impossible
[3446.38 → 3452.48] i saw the overlap and I've seen it with my very own eyes really it's it would be a Tarzan e-bike thing
[3452.48 → 3457.98] of course oh Lord but e-bikes are now like e-bikes have always just been like kind of laughing joke
[3457.98 → 3461.96] of mountain biking like no who wants to ride it, but they're getting lighter yeah they're getting
[3461.96 → 3467.18] lighter, and they're making them more like off-road capable and now there's some e-bikes that are like
[3467.18 → 3471.96] uh somebody was explaining it like the whole stigma around them is that they're stupid they're
[3471.96 → 3476.54] unnecessary it's just the bike industry involved like innovating to make people spend more money on
[3476.54 → 3483.38] shit that they don't need sorry i said i swore on here um but the uh what am I going to do fire you yeah
[3483.38 → 3490.70] i guess so you could today hey you could pull the Luke on me today um the one time i actually fire
[3490.70 → 3496.60] someone, and it actually means anything but uh they're getting better in like the regard that
[3496.60 → 3500.06] somebody was somebody explained it to me really well, and they're like well you know how downhill
[3500.06 → 3505.10] racing oh I'm falling away downhill racing and stuff is always like really intense and whatever
[3505.10 → 3509.38] but now you could have it where you know you're riding downhill and that's all scary and stuff but
[3509.38 → 3514.12] then you're also like really accelerating uphill which is kind of awesome too okay so what's gonna
[3514.12 → 3520.50] happen to the Nikki v character we've got people asking about i don't know do we spoil it i don't
[3520.50 → 3524.72] know i don't know what happens i actually don't know well we do know what happens i know
[3524.72 → 3530.42] things aren't looking good for him, you know he's been if he doesn't die from you know health
[3530.42 → 3536.76] issues from all that pain inhalation and uh you know drinking sauce and all these sorts of
[3536.76 → 3541.38] things that are just really not you know they're going to make you into a healthy person i think uh he's
[3541.38 → 3545.82] going to suffer some serious health complications in the future, but you know that's just for me, i don't
[3545.82 → 3552.98] know he probably has another uh, uh opinion on that uh let's see what else we got coming in here
[3552.98 → 3558.36] is there a YouTube channel that Nikki v will be on and i think they mean nick van Burke of course if
[3558.36 → 3563.36] you mean me I'm not going to try and beat that character to death I've tried to keep it as minimal as like
[3563.36 → 3569.38] i know there's lots of it, but it's something that can very easily be overdone I'll just try to do it
[3569.38 → 3574.04] once in a while i probably won't be doing that on my channel but if you want to see my personal
[3574.04 → 3578.94] YouTube channel that has always existed that you should have known about if you wanted to see it
[3578.94 → 3584.74] it's just called Burke and i post a video there like probably two times a year if that maybe once
[3584.74 → 3591.32] a year maybe I'll put some more up i don't know but like when you do videos full-time for a YouTube
[3591.32 → 3598.30] channel sometimes you like don't really have time or energy to work on your own channel so it kind of
[3598.30 → 3602.96] gets neglected okay I've got a tough one I'm going to put you on the spot Shelgon's potion asks
[3602.96 → 3606.44] what is your favourite memory at leg
[3606.44 → 3614.28] hmm favourite memory probably most intense memory was that prank where you robbed the house
[3614.28 → 3621.36] and because that was like five things at once it was we had a good day like actually painting the car
[3621.36 → 3626.24] this is all in the same day we went to Linus's house at like 9 a.m or something started painting
[3626.24 → 3632.14] the car then we did something else we played badminton or something we ate pizza it was like a great
[3632.14 → 3638.38] summer day we come back and then all of this crap goes down with the robbery and like i was
[3638.38 → 3644.50] I've never been so fooled and so pranked in my life that i like i was like i don't think someone
[3644.50 → 3649.52] stole you again no i don't think so i don't think so Dennis tried to get me with that tinder prank
[3649.52 → 3655.22] and he almost did like the one where it was like somebody messaging me about like uh like hey it's
[3655.22 → 3661.92] blah blah blah from tinder and then i was like wait i have a tinder but I'm very like uninvolved and
[3661.92 → 3665.88] the actual conversation part i just literally have if it's almost like a game i don't use it
[3665.88 → 3670.58] or like i use it but i don't like to follow up but then i was like what the hell and then immediately
[3670.58 → 3675.78] after I'm like closing my phone that's when Dennis comes by with the camera like got you it's like
[3675.78 → 3682.00] no you didn't I knew this all along so we've got a lot of people asking about Ltd and occasional guest
[3682.00 → 3686.22] spots and I'll kind of jump in this is some these are two things or at least one of them that we've
[3686.22 → 3693.38] discussed and i think it's kind of like um this is an amicable breakup, but it's still a breakup so i
[3693.38 → 3699.32] don't think either side is really talking about like you know here what are all the things that
[3699.32 → 3706.16] we're going to do together in the future the door's not being closed no and i don't think i don't think
[3706.16 → 3710.10] uh anyone's saying that they would refuse to walk through a door that was open we're just
[3710.10 → 3717.50] we're kind of going okay we're going our separate ways and everything's everything's good there's
[3717.50 → 3723.02] cake um it's been a hell of a ride yeah it's actually crazy looking back at it because now
[3723.02 → 3727.08] it seems like not a long time but then when you think of all the things that we've done in the
[3727.08 → 3731.70] meantime I've been crazy there's been like years worth of the pace that we go at here i think is
[3731.70 → 3736.50] like maybe some other places like five ten years of work that's the amount of memories is you
[3736.50 → 3740.90] expecting a slower pace because like i was you know i don't know I've done a lot of reflecting
[3740.90 → 3747.34] like I'm thinking about like Germany like the Mexico trip which was like hectic it felt like we were
[3747.34 → 3751.98] down there for months but like looking back at it there was actually a lot of like crazy kind of fun
[3751.98 → 3757.20] stuff and like i do think some of the stuff is the same pace as I've um I've worked with these guys
[3757.20 → 3763.24] once before in California, and it was really high pace, but the one funny thing was like because I'm so used
[3763.24 → 3770.00] to like a crazy turnaround that we've had here for the last i don't know three years going
[3770.00 → 3774.58] to do something where it's like okay this is going to be a stressful event you got to get like you got to
[3774.58 → 3779.28] get a like two videos done today i was like oh no problem I've been doing this every day for like the
[3779.28 → 3782.84] last three years it feels like this shouldn't this should be a breeze but i don't know everything's
[3782.84 → 3788.86] new challenge so uh i don't know pace will probably be pretty high whatever you do you set the pace
[3788.86 → 3794.72] right so maybe I'll burn myself out of that oh sorry will there be a replacement editor actually
[3794.72 → 3801.36] i mean this is something that it comes down to sort of responsible business management you know um
[3801.36 → 3807.70] nick had cut back to 60 earlier this year so we had already proactively hired an additional editor
[3807.70 → 3816.30] just in case um because i mean it's not been a secret ever that your passion is biking and snowboarding
[3816.30 → 3822.68] um like i remember someone I'm not going to name any names but someone before we hired you
[3822.68 → 3829.20] said I'm not sure how long he'll last his real passion is biking and snowboarding videos that's funny
[3829.20 → 3835.16] um i mean you came into a group where you already knew a lot of the people and they obviously
[3835.16 → 3843.04] knew you fairly well um so i remember even when the job was offered i turned it down and
[3843.04 → 3849.16] then said um I'm not going to take this job, and then you're like you know what come down and then i was
[3849.16 → 3856.12] convinced easily that's it a high five yeah never even give me a hug nope what are we supposed to hug
[3856.12 → 3860.34] on wan show dude yeah you can hug on wan show you can do anything you want on wan show as long as there's
[3860.34 → 3868.84] no nipple showing yeah yeah or if we oh all right bud all right dude
[3868.84 → 3875.92] get out of here Colton dude you're crossing the line people are asking what's going to happen to
[3875.92 → 3883.02] channel super fun um we don't know actually channel super fun nick or not nick has had kind of had some
[3883.02 → 3889.46] challenges over the last couple of years we don't know if it makes any sense um the entire twitch chat is
[3889.46 → 3896.18] cringing so hard Colton, so thank you for that that was the most awkward hug since like my weird uncle
[3896.18 → 3903.16] have you ever seen what is that you see me hug my wife i don't know i don't know and have a great
[3903.16 → 3909.28] weekend see you later Colton um yeah well because it challenges super fun has changed so much because
[3909.28 → 3915.08] it was it started out as just a side thing for fun when there was downtime or like a side thing to try
[3915.08 → 3919.62] something out that didn't fit on the other channels than it kind of turned into like oh crap these
[3919.62 → 3924.38] numbers are actually getting pretty good this might be a legitimate channel and then like taking the
[3924.38 → 3929.78] different sure i don't know what these are they're good maple buffalo just a literal piece of bacon
[3929.78 → 3937.94] right on um yeah it changed so much that you know you don't want to keep beating something to death if
[3937.94 → 3942.44] it isn't like organically growing so i think just maybe a different approach or whatever like
[3942.44 → 3949.22] you've noticed that over the past little bit, but there's some good golden era uh channel super
[3949.22 → 3957.66] fun episodes that i still love so much Carolina reaper jerky I've eaten all of that jerky I'll tell
[3957.66 → 3962.60] you one thing it is delicious there's one of them though that like just killed the insides of me
[3962.60 → 3971.12] it's too hot like you feel it like everywhere it just destroys your entire insides so watch out for
[3971.12 → 3979.60] that one um all right i don't seem i don't actually see much else here they want you to bring Linus cat
[3979.60 → 3988.44] tips back yeah i don't see how often do you sprinkle water on that growing flower growing oh i
[3988.44 → 3993.66] don't remember the last time i uploaded something there to be honest it's just like it's so it comes
[3993.66 → 4000.02] down to when you're busy making videos for like a real channel because the idea behind Linus cat
[4000.02 → 4003.58] tips was it would just be me like tooling around at home like playing with my cats or whatever and
[4003.58 → 4009.86] like the last thing i want to do when i have a minute to like to sit down and like cuddle with my cat
[4009.86 → 4014.06] is like get a camera like i don't even want to look at a camera well that's been the same thing with
[4014.06 → 4019.42] like my channel i like I've always just put random whatever project i had been working on that i
[4019.42 → 4024.62] needed to put somewhere on that YouTube channel of mine but yeah like when you're if your week
[4024.62 → 4030.62] consists of like shooting and editing when you get off work, and you're like oh okay i need to go do
[4030.62 → 4035.02] something outside or something like anything not related to what I've just been sitting and doing
[4035.02 → 4040.82] for the last you know eight nine whatever hours yeah it's kind of hard to like to make a video at that
[4040.82 → 4045.60] point, but sometimes you can, we got people asking if you're going to make a goodbye video if you're going
[4045.60 → 4051.38] to do final touch-ups on the uh the Lamborghini and to that i will say we have something special
[4051.38 → 4058.52] in mind as a final as a final video so stay tuned this won't be the last time you see him but this
[4058.52 → 4064.20] is the last time you'll physically be in the building this last time I'll be live that's right I'm live
[4064.20 → 4072.84] are you going to become a daily vlogger i so hope that nobody thinks that that's what that to me like
[4072.84 → 4078.98] I'm like i hope nobody thinks I'm going to like go and try and be all right now my main focus is my
[4078.98 → 4086.02] YouTube channel where I'm gonna daily vlog my like no that's such a sad like spin-off thing i see so
[4086.02 → 4091.68] many people do that like i don't know i can't, I don't know anyone's name in particular, but it's like
[4091.68 → 4098.58] and then they make the first video is like why i left BuzzFeed or whatever, and it's like that video
[4098.58 → 4102.72] will probably do well because people will be like oh why did this dude leave whatever, and then they watch it
[4102.72 → 4108.64] and then it's like then you can't follow that up with like oh this is what i ate this morning and
[4108.64 → 4114.96] nick van estate yeah oh just no that's never been my style come on you guys why i left BuzzFeed
[4114.96 → 4120.34] slash source bed are we going to see that video why i left Linus tech tips yeah all caps and then the
[4120.34 → 4127.88] thumbnail is going to be like me like this like uh no that's not come on who wants to watch that
[4127.88 → 4132.58] people want a spoof of that yeah you know what so that's not a terrible idea somebody else can make
[4132.58 → 4139.96] that video i know all right so it's after six and uh the last thing i can do for people who are
[4139.96 → 4146.50] officially not on the clock anymore is keep them here after work hours so the last thing i have for you
[4146.50 → 4151.84] is a final parting gift a card well you might not want to read it now it is actually a reference letter
[4151.84 → 4157.08] oh wow you already have a job wow, thank you very much but i figure you might not last long at it
[4157.08 → 4162.88] well thank you i very much appreciate that so i proactively wrote that up for you thank you very
[4162.88 → 4167.40] much i think it calls for an on-camera hug Linus all right get in all right
[4167.40 → 4178.34] it all right and that's getting awkward i wanted to keep it for just too long it's been a hell of a
[4178.34 → 4184.26] three years i appreciate that all right thanks guys for tuning in thanks to you for being here and
[4184.26 → 4190.10] uh we will see you guys again next week same bat time same bat channel thank you all
[4190.10 → 4192.04] wow
