[0.00 → 1.68] And...
[1.68 → 2.16] We're live!
[2.66 → 5.10] Boom! We are live, baby!
[6.00 → 7.26] Oh, man.
[8.32 → 11.04] It has been a...
[11.04 → 16.40] I think calling it a rough week would be a gross understatement.
[17.08 → 19.26] Like, disgusting understatement.
[19.46 → 21.14] It has been so tiring.
[21.98 → 25.22] Like, shot three LTTs,
[26.12 → 28.76] shot and reviewed three Fans,
[28.76 → 35.02] and also moved into a new office space,
[35.26 → 39.60] went to the Strata meeting for our building complex here,
[40.12 → 43.00] dealt with the inspector failing us.
[43.38 → 44.78] Oh, also, by the way,
[44.90 → 47.60] I found out we are going to have to clear the path
[47.60 → 51.66] to at least one of the rear doors that are now covered behind sets.
[52.54 → 53.78] Do I need to go on?
[53.96 → 57.66] Like, can I just, you know, go off for a bit here
[57.66 → 59.10] about how this week went?
[59.58 → 60.08] Yeah, no, absolutely. Keep going.
[60.08 → 61.16] I want to know more about the doors.
[61.32 → 63.56] We have had all hands on deck,
[63.64 → 66.88] basically reorganizing this entire place
[66.88 → 68.76] for three days,
[69.02 → 71.62] and with all the stuff that people had to do,
[71.70 → 74.50] and just with all the stuff that needed to be done,
[75.16 → 76.26] it has been a nightmare.
[76.40 → 79.10] Like, if you guys have seen any behind-the-scenes footage,
[79.10 → 82.70] we're going to have a whole organization vlog series coming
[82.70 → 87.56] because that's the only way that we can get around to cleaning stuff up
[87.56 → 89.22] is by vlogging about it.
[89.44 → 93.22] But, like, that unit on the other side of this wall
[93.22 → 96.26] that I'm pointing at right there,
[96.34 → 97.44] that wall, the brown wall,
[97.86 → 98.94] the unit on the other side there,
[99.26 → 100.28] total disaster.
[100.28 → 102.64] If you were ever wondering what happens
[102.64 → 104.20] when you tell a dozen people,
[105.04 → 107.50] hey, there's an empty unit,
[107.68 → 109.24] so, like, if there's any overflow,
[109.42 → 110.10] it goes in there.
[110.60 → 112.60] If you're ever wondering what that looks like
[112.60 → 113.56] after six months,
[114.10 → 116.44] boy, do I ever have the answer for you.
[117.52 → 118.68] A little something like that.
[118.80 → 119.56] By the way, Colton,
[119.80 → 121.90] that crate that you just saw,
[122.24 → 126.34] that is leftover slash ex-wan show stuff,
[126.34 → 128.32] and then that Aztec Land boy
[128.32 → 131.20] is the recreation of Linus' first PC,
[131.52 → 132.50] so that could be, like,
[132.52 → 134.88] a charity auction thing for LTX next year or something.
[134.98 → 136.08] I don't know what else we would do with it.
[136.66 → 138.52] So, like, oh, man,
[138.56 → 140.48] and, like, the kind of crap
[140.48 → 142.30] that we're cleaning up.
[142.40 → 143.10] Like, we're talking
[143.10 → 145.86] the rotted-out husks of
[145.86 → 148.92] old CRTs and, like...
[148.92 → 150.24] I thought you meant literally rotting.
[150.38 → 150.88] I was like, oh.
[150.96 → 152.36] No, no, but, like, dangerous.
[152.68 → 152.88] Yeah.
[152.88 → 154.26] And, like, furniture
[154.26 → 156.78] that we haven't used in months,
[157.10 → 158.76] like the couch
[158.76 → 160.66] that used to be on the LTT set
[160.66 → 162.94] that just went to Unit 101.
[163.28 → 164.34] Oh, this was a good one.
[164.44 → 165.34] This was a perfect one.
[165.54 → 167.36] So, you know those old shelves we had
[167.36 → 168.48] back at the Langley Place
[168.48 → 169.10] in the background?
[169.48 → 169.78] Yes.
[169.92 → 170.14] Okay?
[170.62 → 172.64] That was, like, the old A-roll
[172.64 → 173.26] when we were shooting
[173.26 → 174.30] in the dining room there.
[174.30 → 175.34] Yeah, the like, gold-coloured ones.
[175.36 → 176.18] Yeah, the gold-coloured ones.
[176.22 → 176.44] Okay.
[177.06 → 179.04] So, all the shelves for them
[179.04 → 181.18] were in a scrap wood bin,
[181.18 → 183.24] and then those
[183.24 → 185.10] with just the mid-shelves
[185.10 → 186.32] had just, like,
[186.36 → 187.80] a plank across them
[187.80 → 189.14] and were being used as, like,
[189.44 → 190.68] a warehouse rack.
[191.32 → 192.72] And I'm kind of sitting here going,
[193.58 → 194.04] you know,
[194.22 → 195.70] we actually have
[195.70 → 197.16] scattered around
[197.16 → 198.12] the two warehouses
[198.12 → 200.18] many, many pieces
[200.18 → 202.08] of warehouse racks
[202.08 → 203.42] that could have been assembled
[203.42 → 204.46] to make a warehouse rack.
[204.82 → 205.72] But, like, to be clear,
[205.78 → 206.92] I understand why people
[206.92 → 207.80] are doing these things
[207.80 → 208.78] a lot of the time
[208.78 → 210.96] because they don't have time
[210.96 → 212.42] to solve the problem properly,
[212.66 → 213.46] and we're, like,
[213.70 → 215.08] constantly working
[215.08 → 216.30] at a frantic pace around here.
[216.36 → 217.36] Like, I get it.
[218.34 → 220.24] That just doesn't make it
[220.24 → 220.92] not frustrating.
[222.50 → 223.32] And, um,
[224.20 → 225.26] yeah, so lots of people
[225.26 → 226.12] moved locations.
[226.28 → 226.88] Brandon and Max
[226.88 → 228.42] are in the camera den now.
[228.88 → 230.02] Luke has his own office.
[230.10 → 231.08] How's your office, baby?
[231.22 → 231.60] It's cool.
[231.64 → 233.14] I stole two of the beanbag chairs.
[233.30 → 233.84] Yeah, saw that?
[233.86 → 234.26] So I will have
[234.26 → 235.26] the comfiest meetings
[235.26 → 237.14] ever with my employees
[237.14 → 237.52] that aren't local.
[237.52 → 239.16] We will have the comfiest meetings.
[239.44 → 240.32] My friends called me,
[240.40 → 240.80] they were like,
[241.00 → 241.56] dude, you have
[241.56 → 242.48] the comfiest meetings.
[243.26 → 243.98] Uh, yeah, no,
[244.08 → 245.20] it's weird.
[245.38 → 246.10] It's very weird
[246.10 → 246.98] because I've been with John
[246.98 → 247.78] for, like, two years.
[248.66 → 249.72] Actually, slightly more than that
[249.72 → 251.00] because in the previous office
[251.00 → 251.86] I was also with John.
[252.00 → 253.56] So you upgraded your workspace
[253.56 → 254.68] because you have an office
[254.68 → 255.28] with a door,
[255.76 → 256.62] but you downgraded
[256.62 → 257.12] your neighbour.
[257.84 → 259.42] Yeah, because I don't
[259.42 → 260.16] have one anymore.
[260.32 → 260.76] Yes, you do.
[260.76 → 262.08] And I'm massive...
[262.08 → 262.78] Right next door.
[262.92 → 263.70] But he's not, like...
[263.70 → 265.10] He has to sit next to Nick.
[265.10 → 266.16] But there's, like,
[266.18 → 267.56] a big wall and stuff.
[267.68 → 268.06] Like, John and I
[268.06 → 269.00] had a communal space.
[269.16 → 269.90] And now, like,
[269.98 → 271.74] I got Brandon's old desk.
[272.16 → 272.30] Yeah.
[272.32 → 274.14] So my actual usable desk space
[274.14 → 275.48] probably went down.
[275.54 → 276.14] Yeah, down a little.
[276.36 → 276.94] By, like, actually,
[276.94 → 278.48] like, 30-something percent.
[278.76 → 278.92] Yeah.
[279.00 → 280.30] Like, it's actually a very...
[280.30 → 280.96] I used to have
[280.96 → 281.84] all three of my monitors
[281.84 → 282.94] and quite a bit
[282.94 → 283.66] of usable space.
[283.78 → 283.88] Right.
[283.88 → 284.40] Now I have all three
[284.40 → 284.90] of my monitors
[284.90 → 286.12] and that's where the desk ends.
[286.38 → 287.82] Maybe I was sending a message.
[288.64 → 289.22] Of what?
[289.38 → 290.46] About all the shit
[290.46 → 291.08] that you don't need
[291.08 → 292.16] to keep on your desk anymore.
[292.16 → 292.56] Well, I'm probably
[292.56 → 293.36] going to get another desk.
[293.52 → 293.88] Dang!
[295.26 → 296.80] Mostly because, uh,
[296.84 → 297.98] I want more monitors, though.
[298.48 → 299.04] Dang it!
[299.68 → 301.12] I'm going to put monitors there.
[301.30 → 302.64] I'm probably going to go, like,
[302.70 → 303.46] buy them myself
[303.46 → 304.92] off Craigslist
[304.92 → 306.16] for, like, 25 bucks each.
[306.38 → 306.84] Because I just need
[306.84 → 308.08] Junko crappy monitors
[308.08 → 309.38] to do, like, server monitoring.
[309.64 → 309.92] Right.
[310.02 → 311.08] I don't need nice ones.
[311.14 → 311.70] You know what we could
[311.70 → 312.74] probably figure out
[312.74 → 313.46] is, like,
[313.48 → 314.38] we have, uh,
[314.44 → 315.44] an infinity stand
[315.44 → 316.28] that I don't think
[316.28 → 317.52] anyone knows what to do with.
[318.08 → 319.04] Like, maybe we could...
[319.04 → 320.02] Anyway, you know what?
[320.02 → 321.20] Before you do
[321.20 → 322.60] furniture for your office,
[322.90 → 323.38] um,
[323.94 → 326.20] you're going to want to...
[326.20 → 326.62] Oh, wow.
[326.68 → 327.62] That looks really different
[327.62 → 328.16] than it does...
[328.16 → 329.30] Anyway, we'll solve that later.
[329.62 → 330.04] Oh, yeah.
[330.08 → 331.00] We moved the WAN show.
[331.32 → 331.56] Yeah.
[331.64 → 332.04] Sort of.
[332.26 → 332.48] Yeah.
[332.64 → 333.34] So it's, like,
[333.74 → 334.62] 10 feet back
[334.62 → 335.18] from where it was.
[335.18 → 336.28] Where the camera is now
[336.28 → 336.76] is essentially
[336.76 → 337.82] where the desk was
[337.82 → 338.94] more or less before.
[339.58 → 339.94] Frankly,
[340.14 → 340.80] I don't think
[340.80 → 342.00] it makes a huge difference
[342.00 → 343.14] to the quality of the show.
[343.24 → 343.42] I mean,
[343.48 → 344.16] this show wasn't
[344.16 → 345.18] great quality anyway.
[345.66 → 346.04] And I think
[346.04 → 346.34] it's going to be
[346.34 → 346.86] a lot easier
[346.86 → 347.86] for people to move around.
[347.86 → 349.00] Because now it's not, like,
[349.08 → 349.68] right in the middle
[349.68 → 350.58] of a high traffic area.
[350.66 → 351.98] So, this is interesting.
[352.18 → 352.98] You didn't know this.
[353.08 → 353.52] Oh, sorry.
[353.70 → 354.08] Before...
[354.08 → 354.82] No, before you do
[354.82 → 355.74] furniture stuff in there,
[356.14 → 357.26] um, check with Yvonne
[357.26 → 357.78] because, like,
[357.84 → 358.76] there will probably be, like,
[358.82 → 359.74] a plan already.
[360.14 → 360.50] Okay.
[360.62 → 360.76] And, like,
[360.78 → 361.22] we might be able
[361.22 → 361.72] to get you, like,
[361.72 → 362.58] some shelving and stuff.
[362.58 → 363.72] I'm not even super worried
[363.72 → 364.12] about it.
[364.32 → 365.14] Like, we'll deal with it.
[365.30 → 365.84] But, um,
[366.20 → 366.74] the hexagon...
[366.74 → 367.04] I have, like,
[367.04 → 367.98] a little notepad
[367.98 → 368.74] of the things
[368.74 → 369.88] that I, like, want.
[370.10 → 371.26] The hexagon wall
[371.26 → 372.82] from the spaceship.
[372.82 → 375.94] So, the plan is
[375.94 → 376.72] to just lift that up.
[376.76 → 377.70] You know the RGB wall?
[378.04 → 378.34] Yes.
[378.42 → 378.68] Okay.
[378.86 → 379.64] I think that's just
[379.64 → 380.04] going to go, like,
[380.06 → 380.34] right here.
[380.42 → 381.04] Oh, that's cool.
[381.18 → 381.38] Yeah.
[381.78 → 382.02] Yeah.
[382.02 → 382.82] Because the spaceship
[382.82 → 384.42] is dumb and needs
[384.42 → 384.86] to go away.
[384.96 → 385.40] We're getting rid of that.
[385.46 → 385.96] Yeah, we're getting rid
[385.96 → 386.38] of the spaceship
[386.38 → 387.04] and we're just turning
[387.04 → 387.62] that whole area
[387.62 → 388.52] into, like, a condo.
[389.18 → 389.46] Perfect.
[389.84 → 390.80] That's actually...
[390.80 → 391.00] Yeah.
[391.16 → 391.60] Coming back
[391.60 → 392.58] to the final inspection.
[393.30 → 394.38] So, the theory
[394.38 → 396.26] was that the inspector
[396.26 → 397.46] would come in
[397.46 → 398.52] and look only
[398.52 → 399.34] at the new
[399.34 → 400.06] tenant improvement.
[400.06 → 401.42] and that was
[401.42 → 402.86] actually why
[402.86 → 403.84] we built
[403.84 → 405.28] the new tenant improvement
[405.28 → 407.84] like a half a centimetre
[407.84 → 409.06] away from the old one
[409.06 → 410.22] so that it would actually
[410.22 → 410.98] be a completely
[410.98 → 411.74] separate structure.
[412.36 → 413.92] So, the inspector
[413.92 → 415.08] will not come look
[415.08 → 416.18] at our old tenant improvement
[416.18 → 417.96] because if they did that
[417.96 → 419.80] then any code changes
[419.80 → 420.82] in the last
[420.82 → 421.74] two and a half years
[421.74 → 422.88] would have to be
[422.88 → 423.84] retrofitted to that one.
[423.90 → 424.74] You don't want that.
[424.86 → 425.82] That's a big problem.
[426.74 → 427.12] Okay.
[427.66 → 428.72] So, it turns out
[428.72 → 430.14] they also want to look
[430.14 → 431.66] at the warehouse space
[431.66 → 432.92] because that's under
[432.92 → 434.06] the new tenant improvement.
[434.50 → 435.58] So, that needs
[435.58 → 436.58] three exits
[436.58 → 437.40] to the outside
[437.40 → 438.86] and I thought
[438.86 → 440.62] that those two front doors
[440.62 → 441.74] would still count
[441.74 → 442.78] but technically
[442.78 → 443.84] one of those front doors
[443.84 → 444.84] which is now enclosed
[444.84 → 446.02] and is a dedicated exit
[446.02 → 446.78] for the new improvement
[446.78 → 447.58] because it needs
[447.58 → 448.28] dedicated exits
[448.28 → 449.30] because it's not actually
[449.30 → 450.00] technically part
[450.00 → 450.82] of the old improvement
[450.82 → 452.54] that doesn't count
[452.54 → 453.22] for the warehouse
[453.22 → 454.52] even though
[454.52 → 455.98] assuming that
[455.98 → 456.96] the employees
[456.96 → 458.06] of Linus Media Group
[458.06 → 458.68] are not a bunch
[458.68 → 459.84] of raving idiots
[459.84 → 461.46] I'm sure people
[461.46 → 461.84] would be able
[461.84 → 462.38] to figure out
[462.38 → 463.56] to open one more door
[463.56 → 464.92] to get to the outside
[464.92 → 466.46] and there are already
[466.46 → 467.16] two exits
[467.16 → 468.34] but we need three.
[469.30 → 470.20] So, those
[470.20 → 471.12] are technically
[471.12 → 472.58] sort of
[472.58 → 473.86] obstructed right now.
[474.38 → 475.34] Well, that one
[475.34 → 476.18] definitely is.
[476.32 → 476.96] Well, and the one
[476.96 → 477.70] behind where
[477.70 → 478.84] the long-term
[478.84 → 479.72] dust project
[479.72 → 480.66] that one definitely
[480.66 → 481.20] is too.
[481.42 → 482.44] So, there's one here
[482.44 → 482.90] one there
[482.90 → 483.80] we only have two.
[483.80 → 486.22] So, the good news
[486.22 → 487.04] is that we were
[487.04 → 488.50] planning to
[488.50 → 490.96] rearrange some stuff
[490.96 → 491.66] anyway.
[491.92 → 492.34] That way?
[493.22 → 494.12] So, workshop
[494.12 → 495.52] is maybe going there
[495.52 → 496.74] but then maybe
[496.74 → 497.70] also staying here
[497.70 → 498.08] because like
[498.08 → 498.44] it's pretty
[498.44 → 499.18] I like this set
[499.18 → 499.58] it's the one
[499.58 → 500.52] that I still really like.
[500.74 → 500.80] Yeah.
[501.20 → 502.48] But the green screen
[502.48 → 503.52] is going to shrink
[503.52 → 505.50] and then the condo
[505.50 → 506.30] is going to move
[506.30 → 507.02] this way
[507.02 → 508.28] but then what we
[508.28 → 508.76] could do
[508.76 → 509.36] is we could maybe
[509.36 → 510.02] come get our
[510.02 → 510.80] final inspection
[510.80 → 514.02] while that stuff's
[514.02 → 515.08] kind of torn down
[515.08 → 516.08] and in flux
[516.08 → 517.64] and then maybe
[517.64 → 518.32] the inspector
[518.32 → 520.46] could GTF out of here
[520.46 → 521.90] and then if there
[521.90 → 522.72] ever was a fire
[522.72 → 523.76] there would actually
[523.76 → 525.04] be two full exits
[525.04 → 526.54] for the maximum
[526.54 → 528.28] like five people
[528.28 → 528.84] that are ever
[528.84 → 529.26] in the warehouse
[529.26 → 529.76] No, there would
[529.76 → 530.96] definitely be three.
[531.60 → 532.12] Three.
[532.36 → 533.10] Full exits.
[533.38 → 534.36] People for the
[534.36 → 534.98] five exits.
[535.08 → 535.86] Five exits!
[535.96 → 536.20] Yeah.
[536.76 → 537.94] Many, all the exits!
[537.94 → 541.70] We have the best exits.
[541.74 → 542.44] We'll make America
[542.44 → 543.24] pay for the exit.
[546.90 → 547.62] Those jokes
[547.62 → 549.06] like just never get old.
[549.16 → 550.38] I know, right?
[550.98 → 551.70] It's like
[551.70 → 552.98] We haven't intoed
[552.98 → 553.68] the show yet.
[553.88 → 554.44] Oh, right.
[554.58 → 555.24] Did anything else
[555.24 → 556.22] crazy happen this week?
[556.36 → 556.92] We just finished
[556.92 → 557.72] the inspector part.
[558.40 → 559.32] Anything else crazy?
[559.46 → 561.00] I don't know
[561.00 → 561.84] all the things
[561.84 → 562.64] like it was like
[562.64 → 563.80] archaeology town
[563.80 → 564.44] around here, man.
[564.52 → 565.34] Like honestly
[565.34 → 566.78] organization vlog
[566.78 → 568.44] could be as much
[568.44 → 569.44] fun as moving vlog
[569.44 → 571.24] because even though
[571.24 → 572.14] we didn't
[572.14 → 572.90] No, I don't want
[572.90 → 573.70] to talk about that.
[573.70 → 574.14] Yeah.
[574.58 → 575.30] Someone broke
[575.30 → 576.26] into my van
[576.26 → 577.82] and it's not
[577.82 → 578.82] we're talking about it.
[579.04 → 579.76] Yeah, no, I'm not
[579.76 → 580.24] going to get into it
[580.24 → 580.34] though.
[580.34 → 580.56] Oh, not the like
[580.56 → 581.26] specific bits?
[581.38 → 581.62] Yeah.
[582.80 → 583.50] But like
[583.50 → 583.98] That was a really
[583.98 → 584.58] loud train.
[585.02 → 585.46] Honestly,
[585.80 → 586.62] we've actually
[586.62 → 587.54] Here, wrap your brain
[587.54 → 588.04] around this.
[588.12 → 588.28] Okay.
[588.34 → 589.10] I'm about to blow
[589.10 → 589.72] your mind.
[590.08 → 590.78] All right.
[590.88 → 592.20] We've been in here
[592.20 → 593.84] longer than we were
[593.84 → 594.90] in the Langley house.
[594.98 → 595.48] No, I know.
[595.58 → 596.38] I had that realization.
[596.38 → 597.68] I walked out of my
[597.68 → 598.90] office today to come
[598.90 → 600.06] down to here and was
[600.06 → 601.22] like, bye office.
[601.34 → 602.18] And then just like
[602.18 → 603.70] brainwave hit me and I
[603.70 → 604.42] fell over into a bean
[604.42 → 605.06] bag chair because I
[605.06 → 606.48] was like, holy crap.
[606.84 → 607.46] Because I was like,
[607.82 → 608.82] I was like, that felt
[608.82 → 610.38] more impactful than
[610.38 → 611.56] leaving the old office.
[611.56 → 612.26] And I was like, I
[612.26 → 612.92] wonder why.
[612.98 → 613.84] And I was like, oh,
[614.18 → 614.44] wow.
[614.44 → 614.94] Because you've been
[614.94 → 616.04] in there forever.
[616.30 → 616.56] Yeah.
[617.10 → 617.50] Yeah.
[617.70 → 618.80] Isn't that crazy?
[619.20 → 619.70] It's my two year
[619.70 → 620.54] anniversary on Monday.
[620.64 → 622.40] It's your two years?
[622.66 → 623.28] Yeah, buddy.
[623.40 → 624.38] Is that past the point
[624.38 → 625.18] where I can just fire
[625.18 → 626.06] you for no cause
[626.06 → 626.82] and with no notice?
[626.92 → 627.72] Well, I mean,
[627.76 → 628.36] you are the owner
[628.36 → 628.80] of the company.
[628.84 → 629.66] Is it Max?
[630.40 → 630.84] Yes.
[631.06 → 633.46] Max like, yeah, dog.
[635.62 → 636.18] All right.
[636.22 → 637.16] Well then, I guess
[637.16 → 638.00] you're still on the team,
[638.12 → 638.34] Colton.
[639.32 → 639.76] Yeah.
[639.94 → 640.16] Woo.
[640.28 → 641.44] Colton's still on the team.
[641.68 → 642.84] Let's do some ads.
[644.44 → 645.44] We'll get to the ads
[645.44 → 645.70] later.
[645.80 → 646.26] We'll get to the ads
[646.26 → 646.48] later.
[647.26 → 648.20] So yeah, there's
[648.20 → 649.40] actually like more
[649.40 → 650.98] archaeology to do here
[650.98 → 652.10] than there was.
[652.10 → 652.76] And you remember how
[652.76 → 655.52] freaking crazy that place
[655.52 → 655.92] was.
[657.30 → 658.48] So yeah, it's going to
[658.48 → 659.28] be a lot of fun.
[659.36 → 660.30] And there's a lot of
[660.30 → 661.60] personalities involved.
[661.82 → 662.14] Okay.
[662.68 → 664.02] Things got snippy a little
[664.02 → 664.32] bit.
[664.32 → 665.12] Because like, I know you
[665.12 → 665.90] weren't here this week.
[665.90 → 667.32] I saw some of the team
[667.32 → 667.90] chat though.
[668.52 → 669.40] Things have gotten a
[669.40 → 670.00] little snippy.
[670.12 → 670.54] You know, there have
[670.54 → 672.48] been some messages to
[672.48 → 673.50] the group chat about
[673.50 → 676.06] grading people's ability
[676.06 → 677.48] to park their cars
[677.48 → 679.02] far enough back from
[679.02 → 679.88] the sidewalk.
[680.30 → 680.58] Yeah.
[680.58 → 682.28] You know, like there's
[682.28 → 682.90] been...
[682.90 → 683.32] That was like way too
[683.32 → 683.72] sassy.
[683.90 → 685.44] That was probably
[685.44 → 687.80] over the line sassy.
[688.42 → 690.72] And so yeah, stuff's
[690.72 → 692.24] gotten real this week.
[695.18 → 696.38] Meanwhile, I'm like
[696.38 → 697.14] sitting on a train.
[697.58 → 697.80] Yeah.
[697.94 → 698.72] Meanwhile, you're on a
[698.72 → 698.94] train.
[699.06 → 699.58] I can't really tell
[699.58 → 700.52] about what my event was.
[701.54 → 703.04] Retrieving our broken
[703.04 → 703.88] company van.
[704.14 → 704.42] Yeah.
[705.34 → 706.58] Which was like...
[707.58 → 708.48] So I was expecting
[708.48 → 709.32] this train trip to be
[709.32 → 709.68] horrible.
[709.68 → 710.54] I only got two hours
[710.54 → 711.30] of sleep beforehand.
[711.52 → 711.62] Yeah.
[711.72 → 711.96] Which sucked.
[712.32 → 713.16] But like, it's a train
[713.16 → 713.38] trip.
[713.50 → 714.32] So whatever.
[714.52 → 714.66] Yeah.
[715.42 → 716.48] Got held over at the
[716.48 → 716.74] border.
[716.94 → 717.58] They didn't want to let
[717.58 → 719.30] me down because they
[719.30 → 720.22] couldn't understand what
[720.22 → 721.18] I was going down to do.
[721.20 → 721.40] Don't let me.
[721.52 → 722.26] Don't let me.
[722.48 → 722.68] Don't let me.
[722.68 → 723.14] Well, they were like,
[723.18 → 723.78] why are you going there?
[723.78 → 724.30] I need you.
[724.36 → 724.74] I need you.
[725.00 → 726.14] I need you right now.
[727.20 → 727.80] Don't let me.
[728.04 → 728.80] I can't remember.
[729.00 → 729.12] Okay.
[729.18 → 729.28] Sorry.
[730.28 → 730.98] They're like, they're
[730.98 → 731.62] wondering why I was
[731.62 → 733.10] going so far to pick up
[733.10 → 734.18] the vehicle and then like
[734.18 → 735.56] stopping off somewhere else.
[735.80 → 736.32] It's a fair question.
[736.32 → 737.40] It wasn't my vehicle.
[737.46 → 737.58] Yeah.
[737.58 → 738.22] It's a fair question.
[738.22 → 739.30] And then he kept on
[739.30 → 739.96] getting confused about
[739.96 → 740.74] who I worked for.
[741.28 → 741.64] Okay.
[741.76 → 743.06] Which was really difficult
[743.06 → 743.58] to understand.
[743.58 → 744.16] Also a fair question.
[744.22 → 744.82] Well, not really.
[744.96 → 745.72] Because he would be like,
[745.76 → 746.28] who do you work for?
[746.34 → 746.58] And I'd be like,
[746.64 → 747.18] Linus Media Group.
[747.48 → 747.74] He'd be like,
[747.78 → 748.92] who owns a vehicle?
[749.18 → 750.00] Linus Media Group.
[750.74 → 751.10] Okay.
[751.28 → 752.34] So is it your vehicle?
[752.46 → 752.68] I was like,
[752.76 → 753.72] no, it's the company's.
[754.08 → 754.88] What company's?
[756.72 → 757.60] Linus Media Group.
[758.50 → 758.86] Okay.
[759.22 → 760.40] So you did make it
[760.40 → 761.50] pretty easy on him.
[761.60 → 761.84] Yeah.
[761.84 → 762.54] Like it wasn't,
[762.54 → 763.66] it wasn't super complicated.
[763.86 → 764.04] Okay.
[764.14 → 764.46] But then, yeah,
[764.52 → 765.54] we got pulled in
[765.54 → 766.44] and it wasn't,
[766.64 → 767.56] it just took an annoying
[767.56 → 768.02] amount of time
[768.02 → 768.90] when like there's a train
[768.90 → 769.74] that's going to leave.
[770.52 → 770.88] Right.
[771.00 → 772.12] But I left intentionally
[772.12 → 773.36] like way early.
[773.48 → 774.00] So I ended up being
[774.00 → 774.66] totally fine,
[774.78 → 775.68] which is part of the reason
[775.68 → 776.84] why I got such a small
[776.84 → 777.28] amount of sleep
[777.28 → 777.64] or whatever.
[778.10 → 778.98] And then the Wi-Fi
[778.98 → 780.22] on the train was legendary.
[780.54 → 782.52] No streaming of any kind allowed.
[783.28 → 783.52] Yeah.
[783.64 → 784.00] Not even,
[784.00 → 785.04] not even music.
[785.46 → 785.76] Okay.
[785.98 → 787.64] And any files above 10 legs,
[787.70 → 788.30] they just killed.
[789.66 → 790.02] Really?
[790.28 → 790.52] Yeah.
[790.74 → 791.10] You can,
[791.16 → 791.32] you know,
[791.34 → 792.52] you can VPN it usually.
[792.62 → 792.88] Yeah.
[793.06 → 793.70] Some of the
[793.78 → 794.46] some of the airlines.
[794.48 → 795.24] I see that on the ferry
[795.24 → 795.64] and stuff.
[795.64 → 796.82] Like I'm not new to that,
[796.88 → 797.60] but it's just like,
[797.70 → 797.98] ah,
[798.66 → 799.12] all right,
[799.24 → 799.64] come on,
[799.78 → 800.14] come on.
[800.42 → 800.76] And then,
[800.82 → 801.40] so I get down there,
[801.46 → 801.90] get the vehicle.
[802.00 → 802.26] It's fine.
[802.34 → 803.08] Check out Rod's shop.
[803.18 → 804.02] It's amazing.
[804.32 → 804.50] Yep.
[804.72 → 805.26] Holy cow.
[805.32 → 806.54] His CNC is incredible.
[807.20 → 807.82] It's so,
[807.96 → 808.58] it's expensive,
[808.58 → 810.04] but it's badass.
[810.26 → 810.40] Yeah.
[810.82 → 811.62] Rod's pretty dope.
[811.80 → 812.90] And then I went up to Microsoft
[812.90 → 813.98] and things happened.
[815.30 → 816.52] And then you guys will hear
[816.52 → 817.04] about that later.
[818.46 → 818.90] Yeah.
[818.96 → 819.42] So my,
[819.48 → 820.34] my week was,
[820.40 → 820.72] uh,
[820.86 → 822.06] definitely more eventful
[822.06 → 822.54] than yours.
[823.54 → 824.08] I mean,
[824.10 → 825.36] mine was pretty eventful.
[825.52 → 825.68] Yeah.
[826.02 → 826.22] Maybe.
[826.66 → 826.92] You know,
[826.92 → 827.80] but we wouldn't know that.
[828.00 → 828.22] No.
[828.70 → 828.94] Right.
[829.10 → 829.46] Get owned.
[830.00 → 830.28] Right.
[830.28 → 831.62] Um,
[831.78 → 832.64] all right.
[832.96 → 835.58] So I guess we should get into the news for the week.
[835.64 → 836.84] We haven't even rolled the intro.
[837.34 → 837.50] Well,
[837.58 → 837.72] okay.
[837.80 → 838.40] Without looking at,
[838.40 → 839.22] without looking at the doc.
[839.46 → 839.90] Okay.
[839.90 → 840.34] Uh,
[840.34 → 840.68] uh,
[840.68 → 840.94] uh,
[840.94 → 841.52] uh,
[841.52 → 842.10] Vega,
[842.44 → 843.06] Thread ripper,
[843.46 → 843.74] uh,
[843.80 → 844.60] Core i9.
[844.74 → 844.94] Yep.
[845.52 → 846.08] Uh,
[846.14 → 847.32] maybe Nvidia did something.
[849.00 → 849.48] Yeah.
[849.82 → 850.22] Cool.
[850.32 → 850.78] Sounds good.
[850.90 → 851.50] Roll the intro.
[851.50 → 852.14] Roll the intro.
[852.32 → 852.74] Forget it.
[852.80 → 853.24] Screw it.
[853.24 → 860.12] All the first topics are i9 Thread ripper and Vega.
[861.00 → 861.48] Sick.
[865.12 → 865.60] Sick,
[865.72 → 866.24] Brad.
[866.48 → 868.04] I'm trying to see if Nvidia did something,
[868.16 → 868.88] but I don't think so.
[871.28 → 874.26] Maybe it just wasn't newsworthy because like,
[874.32 → 876.24] it didn't make it into the circle jerk.
[876.66 → 876.94] Right.
[877.30 → 877.52] Yeah.
[878.26 → 881.52] Am I allowed to say circle jerk while I'm flashing our sponsor logos on the screen?
[883.24 → 884.90] Let's just hope they don't look at that part.
[886.02 → 886.94] All right.
[888.20 → 888.60] And,
[888.72 → 889.74] yeah,
[889.80 → 890.70] it must be the WAN show.
[891.18 → 891.58] That's weird.
[891.66 → 893.86] I resized it, and now it looks so different to me.
[896.90 → 897.64] It kind of does.
[897.76 → 897.92] I wonder,
[898.06 → 898.24] yeah,
[898.26 → 899.72] we could probably move it a little closer even.
[899.78 → 901.20] Try and take up even less space out there.
[901.38 → 901.52] Yeah.
[901.84 → 902.42] All right.
[902.50 → 906.54] So why don't we move into our first tech topic of the week.
[906.74 → 911.54] So the Core i9 CPU lineup specs have been finalized.
[911.54 → 914.02] This is according to PC Pen.
[914.08 → 917.54] It was posted by the Benjamin's over on the forum.
[918.18 → 927.78] Now there was a lot of speculation that the reason that Intel wasn't finalizing some aspects of their,
[927.78 → 934.42] of the rest of the Core i9 lineup was because they had no idea if they were going to be able to make these bloody things.
[934.42 → 939.34] Based on how much power they were going to consume and how much heat they were going to output.
[940.08 → 940.30] Which,
[940.40 → 940.56] okay,
[940.66 → 941.84] is kind of a weird trend.
[942.00 → 942.68] Can I just say?
[943.42 → 945.88] If these processors being huge amount of power,
[945.96 → 946.50] huge amount of heat,
[946.60 → 946.80] Vega,
[946.94 → 947.50] huge amount of power,
[947.58 → 948.16] huge amount of heat,
[948.52 → 950.10] where for the last longest time,
[950.16 → 950.66] it's just been like,
[950.72 → 953.12] those things don't matter because they're just constantly going down.
[953.12 → 953.64] Well,
[953.82 → 954.22] that's,
[954.30 → 954.74] I guess,
[954.86 → 955.16] what,
[955.22 → 958.58] what competition does is it forces you to push the envelope a little bit.
[958.68 → 958.76] Yeah,
[958.86 → 959.40] which is cool.
[959.58 → 959.86] Um,
[959.90 → 960.82] so here we go.
[961.06 → 966.42] So Skylike X goes up to 18 cores as we already knew,
[966.42 → 968.78] but this is some interesting stuff.
[968.86 → 973.50] It'll turbo up to 4.4 gigahertz at turboboost max speeds,
[973.50 → 978.74] and it'll turboboost at turboboost 2.0 speeds of up to 4.2 gigahertz.
[979.52 → 980.18] So that's,
[980.18 → 980.54] uh,
[980.86 → 981.68] that's pretty sick.
[981.72 → 983.04] I guess it'll cost two grand,
[983.12 → 984.10] which we already knew,
[984.14 → 985.28] and it'll have 18 cores,
[985.42 → 988.12] 36 threads as we already knew.
[988.20 → 991.48] So the pricing looks like from the 7900 X,
[991.52 → 993.86] which is kind of the flagship right now at a thousand bucks,
[994.02 → 995.10] you're going to pay 200,
[995.36 → 995.80] 200,
[996.08 → 996.68] 300,
[996.90 → 999.08] then another 300 to get 12,
[999.18 → 999.60] 14,
[999.74 → 1000.04] 16,
[1000.18 → 1001.66] and 18 cores respectively.
[1001.66 → 1004.82] And they pretty much are all going to turbo the same,
[1005.10 → 1007.98] except the 7900 X and the 7820,
[1008.52 → 1011.30] which are going to hit 4.5 gigahertz.
[1011.42 → 1013.42] So those are your single thread Kings.
[1014.04 → 1016.60] If you need a high core count processor,
[1016.74 → 1023.80] because otherwise you're just getting a 7700 K because you're not stupid enough to spend money on an LGA 2066 motherboard.
[1024.04 → 1026.12] So you can put a 7740 on it.
[1027.62 → 1030.72] How that stacks up with Thread ripper is that basically,
[1030.72 → 1036.10] multicore at the same core counts performance is going to look fairly similar.
[1036.24 → 1040.98] Remember Skylike is a generation behind Kaby Lake on the consumer side.
[1040.98 → 1047.10] So that is one fewer generational improvement that AMD has to fight with on this platform.
[1048.50 → 1050.16] So at similar core counts,
[1050.24 → 1051.70] they're going to perform pretty similarly,
[1051.92 → 1056.02] except maybe a little less for AMD because their max turbo is 4 gigahertz.
[1056.02 → 1061.10] But what AMD brings to the table is higher base clocks.
[1061.10 → 1063.76] So in those highly threaded workloads,
[1063.94 → 1065.42] AMD is going to look pretty good.
[1065.60 → 1068.02] And they bring lower pricing to the table.
[1068.54 → 1071.60] So your 16 core is going to cost a thousand bucks.
[1071.72 → 1074.50] So AMD is going head-to-head against Intel's 10 core.
[1074.50 → 1080.62] And their 12 core gets to go up against somewhere between an 8 core and a 10 core.
[1080.62 → 1089.14] But that 8 core is actually kind of kneecapped with only 28 PCIe lanes versus Thread ripper's full 64.
[1089.14 → 1095.56] And then the 1900X is that kind of weirdo skew where it's only got 8 core, 16 threads,
[1096.04 → 1101.44] just like the consumer top-end Ry zen 7.
[1102.30 → 1108.90] But it's got 64 PCIe lanes for being able to put like lots of GPUs or other devices on it.
[1109.12 → 1110.08] And Nick needs something.
[1110.18 → 1110.92] What can I do for you?
[1111.00 → 1111.46] I need you.
[1111.46 → 1117.64] You need me like water, like the other words.
[1118.04 → 1123.16] I'm going to show you guys something while Linus is gone that I just think is absolutely wonderful.
[1124.54 → 1126.58] I opened it on the wrong computer.
[1126.74 → 1127.08] It's okay.
[1127.18 → 1127.94] I'll figure this out.
[1128.76 → 1130.06] Perpetual Winch O'Doc.
[1132.14 → 1133.66] So this happened on Twitter.
[1133.76 → 1135.02] You guys might have seen it.
[1135.42 → 1137.98] It was pretty popular on the Reddit's today.
[1138.56 → 1139.64] But NVIDIA tweeted out,
[1139.64 → 1140.90] Welcome back, AMD.
[1141.46 → 1144.96] Thread ripper and a GeForce 1080 Ti make a compelling pair.
[1145.32 → 1148.72] It's interesting because you have to remember that they're technically separate business groups.
[1149.04 → 1151.56] The graphics cards and the CPUs on AMD's side.
[1152.00 → 1155.58] So NVIDIA's like totally okay with doing stuff like this.
[1156.82 → 1158.74] The fight is coming.
[1160.58 → 1161.52] Give me one second.
[1162.80 → 1164.80] I think with that we're going to move on.
[1165.04 → 1165.38] Wow.
[1169.44 → 1169.72] What?
[1169.72 → 1171.66] Okay, hold up.
[1171.76 → 1172.92] How do we turn this back on?
[1174.82 → 1175.70] Does it automatically?
[1175.82 → 1176.68] You can talk normally.
[1177.38 → 1178.78] It just automatically turns back on.
[1179.04 → 1183.74] Okay, so unfortunately a light that is like right here was unplugged.
[1183.88 → 1186.32] And it takes like a long time for it to heat up.
[1186.32 → 1188.34] Which, does that make sense?
[1188.44 → 1189.30] Because it was already hot?
[1191.36 → 1192.24] We'll figure it out.
[1192.34 → 1193.32] We'll figure it out.
[1194.26 → 1195.24] I was unplugging a vacuum.
[1195.54 → 1196.64] And I unplugged the wrong thing.
[1197.12 → 1198.30] You're going to vacuum here?
[1199.36 → 1199.96] Right now?
[1200.26 → 1200.70] No, no.
[1200.78 → 1201.38] I unplugged it.
[1201.58 → 1202.50] Oh, unplugging it.
[1202.60 → 1202.78] Continue.
[1202.78 → 1203.76] Okay, anyway.
[1203.92 → 1204.16] Sorry.
[1204.28 → 1204.88] Moving on.
[1207.04 → 1210.36] Enema is going to have the first out of the gate AIO for Thread ripper.
[1210.48 → 1213.66] I'm going to drop this into the chat and then try to get it up on screen real quick.
[1213.66 → 1220.84] I don't see it warming up, so I'm really not sure about that.
[1221.64 → 1222.78] Yeah, that might be a good idea.
[1222.86 → 1223.14] What's up?
[1223.18 → 1223.50] What's up?
[1223.54 → 1224.14] What's up?
[1224.76 → 1227.04] We're going to talk about Thread ripper's first water block.
[1227.08 → 1227.62] What just happened?
[1228.34 → 1230.48] Yeah, Colton accidentally unplugged that.
[1230.98 → 1231.70] I showed this off.
[1231.72 → 1234.80] Did he accidentally copyright strike our own channel while he's at it?
[1235.84 → 1237.14] Yeah, you heard me, Colton.
[1239.28 → 1240.58] I showed this off real quick.
[1241.20 → 1241.76] Oh, cool.
[1241.76 → 1244.12] What?
[1244.58 → 1246.46] Yeah, so that happened on Twitter.
[1246.78 → 1247.18] No.
[1247.84 → 1248.10] Yeah.
[1248.34 → 1254.12] You know, with how much bad blood there is between those two companies, like, that almost
[1254.12 → 1258.10] comes across as, like, throwing shade, man.
[1259.52 → 1260.08] Yeah.
[1261.60 → 1266.82] Like, oh, man, that is, like, honestly, like, the way...
[1266.82 → 1267.14] Okay.
[1267.54 → 1269.76] So, first...
[1269.76 → 1270.90] Oh.
[1271.76 → 1276.10] So, AMD did segment the company.
[1276.46 → 1277.94] So, they switched over to the...
[1277.94 → 1279.00] Yeah, I said that when you were gone.
[1279.22 → 1280.56] AMD and Radio and Technologies Group.
[1280.72 → 1284.04] So, like, technically, NVIDIA is just talking to the CPU side.
[1284.04 → 1284.18] Yeah.
[1284.18 → 1290.94] And technically, a lot of the bad blood really is between NVIDIA and ATI.
[1291.44 → 1291.76] Yeah.
[1291.92 → 1293.56] That's how far back it goes.
[1293.90 → 1296.60] But, like, the engineering teams...
[1296.60 → 1301.28] Like, the engineering team at AMD contains ATI people still, like, for sure.
[1301.52 → 1301.74] Yeah.
[1301.74 → 1303.82] Like, there are a lot of lifers that are still around there.
[1305.62 → 1307.24] Hey, Brandon, is it, like, coming back?
[1307.42 → 1308.06] I think so.
[1308.42 → 1308.86] So...
[1308.86 → 1309.92] Like...
[1309.92 → 1313.38] Here, here, here.
[1313.46 → 1314.02] No, no, it's fine.
[1314.08 → 1314.28] It's fine.
[1314.30 → 1314.70] Don't worry about it.
[1314.74 → 1315.94] I don't see it warming up.
[1316.04 → 1316.96] I got a solution.
[1317.12 → 1317.56] Here, look.
[1318.12 → 1318.88] It's not...
[1318.88 → 1319.54] It's not...
[1319.54 → 1319.68] What?
[1319.78 → 1320.42] Oh, nice!
[1320.58 → 1320.84] Yeah!
[1320.94 → 1322.22] Yeah, we used the flashlight.
[1322.86 → 1323.92] Flashlight on the phone, baby!
[1325.30 → 1326.00] There we go.
[1326.18 → 1326.68] No problem.
[1326.82 → 1327.58] Okay, we got this.
[1327.62 → 1328.08] We got this.
[1330.08 → 1331.84] So, what's your vibe?
[1331.92 → 1332.44] What's your vibe?
[1332.76 → 1333.32] Genuine...
[1333.32 → 1334.10] Nice!
[1334.10 → 1336.24] Genuine welcome back to the enthusiast party?
[1336.90 → 1337.78] Or, uh...
[1337.78 → 1338.00] What?
[1338.46 → 1339.96] Or are they throwing shade?
[1340.16 → 1342.94] Like, like, ha-ha, you weren't around for five years.
[1342.98 → 1345.04] I would give them a benefit of the doubt here.
[1345.04 → 1348.86] You would give NVIDIA the benefit of the doubt when it comes to crapping,
[1348.88 → 1349.32] on AMD.
[1351.66 → 1353.74] Okay, but it is crapping on them.
[1353.96 → 1354.82] The welcome back.
[1355.30 → 1357.32] The welcome back part is crapping on them.
[1357.42 → 1362.02] But they are legitimately saying, like, we think our GPUs will work well with your CPUs.
[1362.26 → 1362.84] Which they will.
[1363.26 → 1363.46] Yeah.
[1363.48 → 1364.00] That's a good point.
[1364.28 → 1366.12] And they are legitimately saying that.
[1366.24 → 1367.88] So, I think they're, like...
[1369.78 → 1374.74] Like, to the guy who, like, goes on vacation for a year and then scores his first touchdown
[1374.74 → 1377.30] after, like, a really, really, really long time.
[1377.30 → 1379.22] And you're like, welcome back.
[1379.34 → 1380.22] You did a good job.
[1380.44 → 1381.50] Like, it's a little sassy.
[1381.62 → 1383.14] But at the same time, you're like, okay.
[1383.32 → 1383.72] Good job.
[1383.72 → 1385.06] I'll give it a minute to work well.
[1385.24 → 1386.12] I think it's turning on.
[1386.66 → 1387.64] I think we're going to get some...
[1387.64 → 1388.72] Or it's just broken now.
[1389.18 → 1391.08] Yeah, it's possible that we, like...
[1391.08 → 1391.42] Hey!
[1391.80 → 1392.06] Hey!
[1392.96 → 1393.78] The light's on.
[1393.82 → 1394.08] Okay.
[1394.08 → 1395.98] Oh, Lord.
[1396.46 → 1396.80] Okay.
[1398.08 → 1399.58] What else we got in the news this week?
[1399.58 → 1399.92] Here, training.
[1402.16 → 1402.52] Wow.
[1402.86 → 1403.72] World's worst throw.
[1404.46 → 1404.84] Sorry.
[1406.20 → 1407.20] This is interesting.
[1407.40 → 1409.86] So, this was posted by Knick-knack on the forum.
[1410.06 → 1410.98] More Thread ripper news.
[1411.12 → 1411.22] The original...
[1411.22 → 1411.84] I think it isn't on.
[1411.90 → 1412.90] It's warming up now.
[1412.98 → 1413.54] You guys will...
[1413.54 → 1414.34] It's coming back.
[1414.36 → 1414.38] Don't worry.
[1414.44 → 1414.74] It's coming.
[1414.82 → 1415.08] It's coming.
[1415.48 → 1418.10] The original article is from Tom's Hardware.
[1418.10 → 1419.10] Okay.
[1420.18 → 1423.10] So, there was a lot of controversy over Intel's...
[1424.10 → 1426.54] I don't even remember what the stupid feature's called anymore.
[1426.70 → 1433.44] But their bootable RAID that bypasses the PCI Express controller in the chipset and goes
[1433.44 → 1434.22] straight off the...
[1434.22 → 1435.26] Something...
[1435.26 → 1435.88] Something rock.
[1436.48 → 1436.90] Dang it.
[1437.88 → 1438.26] V-Rock.
[1438.58 → 1438.78] Ah.
[1439.02 → 1439.96] So, V-Rock.
[1440.96 → 1445.64] Intel's software RAID that's running straight off the CPU that's bootable.
[1445.64 → 1453.64] There's a lot of controversy over Intel's intention to allow users to upgrade to it with a hardware
[1453.64 → 1457.88] enabling key that they have to plug into their motherboard.
[1459.08 → 1460.60] So, I'll give them this, though.
[1460.74 → 1467.64] They were a step ahead of AMD who is straight up not able to support bootable NVMe RAID at
[1468.38 → 1468.88] all right now.
[1470.94 → 1471.98] So, there...
[1471.98 → 1473.78] How many people do you think this excludes?
[1475.64 → 1477.64] Okay.
[1478.32 → 1479.08] Two answers.
[1480.22 → 1481.14] Answer number one.
[1481.96 → 1482.68] Very few.
[1483.02 → 1483.24] Yeah.
[1483.46 → 1484.46] Answer number two.
[1485.02 → 1487.64] Within the community of users...
[1487.64 → 1488.82] That are going to buy something at this tier.
[1488.82 → 1490.02] That are buying $1,000 processors.
[1490.28 → 1490.40] Yeah.
[1490.88 → 1492.38] $400 motherboards.
[1492.84 → 1500.48] If I'm spending this kind of money on a motherboard, I better have cash Ola to just drop on NVMe
[1500.48 → 1500.74] RAID.
[1500.74 → 1506.04] But even then, buying a one terabyte NVMe drives as just your bootable drive, and then
[1506.04 → 1509.54] doing other stuff with other things, like hard drives and whatnot for, like, huge amounts
[1509.54 → 1512.40] of storage beyond that, seems pretty reasonable, I think.
[1512.64 → 1512.96] Yeah.
[1513.18 → 1517.68] Like, even my crazy, stupid, overbuilt computer just has one NVMe drive.
[1518.68 → 1519.24] And...
[1519.24 → 1523.42] And it's lightning fast, and I can't tell the difference between the stuff that's on the
[1523.42 → 1524.00] SATA RAID.
[1525.52 → 1526.00] Yeah.
[1526.52 → 1527.04] And...
[1527.04 → 1531.20] Because it's pretty fast, having, like, three really quick SSDs in RAID 0.
[1531.38 → 1539.68] So, there aren't a ton of consumer applications for NVMe RAID boot drives.
[1540.68 → 1541.28] However...
[1541.28 → 1541.62] Boot drives.
[1541.62 → 1545.12] That's the part that I'm trying to make very clear here that I'm talking about.
[1545.12 → 1545.22] Yes.
[1545.22 → 1545.92] The booting part.
[1545.92 → 1547.22] Because you can always software RAID NVMe drives.
[1547.42 → 1547.48] Yeah.
[1547.64 → 1548.36] That's been...
[1548.36 → 1552.26] I have a software RAID of NVMe drives that we're running our editing server off of.
[1552.26 → 1552.44] Yeah.
[1552.56 → 1554.74] So, we're specifically talking about boot drives.
[1554.74 → 1554.92] Yeah.
[1555.34 → 1562.08] And honestly, I have a hard time telling the difference between an NVMe boot drive and
[1562.08 → 1564.38] even a good SATA SSD boot drive.
[1564.52 → 1565.54] Like, not even RAID 0.
[1565.58 → 1566.80] Unless I'm hitting it pretty hard.
[1567.06 → 1567.20] Yeah.
[1567.20 → 1578.14] However, Thread ripper is being targeted at the workstation user as well as the enthusiast
[1578.14 → 1581.80] who's just like, her-a-derp, I want the fastest!
[1582.60 → 1583.72] I want to go faster!
[1584.52 → 1588.30] And just, like, buying more NVMe drives even though they know they can't tell the difference.
[1588.78 → 1595.18] And on the workstation, where you're working with some, like, huge data set or something,
[1595.18 → 1601.70] we're talking 16 cores crunching it, you could run into an IO bottleneck.
[1601.70 → 1603.62] But how do you care about it being on the boot drive?
[1608.74 → 1610.54] Also, they're enabling the feature in the future.
[1614.26 → 1615.44] So, this is kind of a...
[1615.44 → 1615.60] What?
[1615.86 → 1617.28] This is kind of a non-story.
[1617.52 → 1618.06] This is kind of a non-story.
[1618.06 → 1619.78] I didn't even notice that part at launch.
[1619.98 → 1620.26] Okay?
[1620.26 → 1620.86] No.
[1621.70 → 1623.20] No, I was just mostly messing with you.
[1623.20 → 1626.92] So, like, it barely matters, and it only matters for a limited period of time?
[1627.14 → 1627.50] Yes.
[1628.20 → 1628.60] All right.
[1628.66 → 1629.28] This is kind of...
[1629.28 → 1634.26] Okay, this is one of those things where, like, it's kind of like Intel having...
[1634.90 → 1641.26] Okay, so Intel had support for NVMe RAID within their...
[1641.26 → 1642.38] What's that stupid...
[1642.38 → 1642.96] RST?
[1643.40 → 1644.26] Rapid Storage Technology?
[1644.26 → 1644.70] Oh, yeah.
[1644.70 → 1645.10] Yeah.
[1645.10 → 1646.36] Or SRT?
[1646.42 → 1647.22] No, RST.
[1647.38 → 1651.96] Their Rapid Storage Technology, like, their driver, like, software RAID doodad that lives
[1651.96 → 1652.56] in the system tray.
[1652.76 → 1653.08] There you go.
[1653.32 → 1653.52] Okay.
[1653.76 → 1657.24] So, they had support for NVMe RAID going back quite a ways.
[1658.10 → 1662.08] But the problem, for me, when I bought that 48 NVMe server...
[1662.08 → 1663.10] Man, that makes me feel old.
[1663.26 → 1663.60] I didn't...
[1663.60 → 1663.72] Sorry.
[1663.76 → 1666.82] I shouldn't say bought because Supermicro sent it to me, but I bought the drives that went
[1666.82 → 1667.08] in it.
[1667.48 → 1668.36] Going back quite a ways.
[1668.42 → 1671.60] I still remember making the video for, like, the first drive, let alone...
[1671.60 → 1671.92] Right.
[1672.12 → 1672.40] Anyway.
[1672.40 → 1673.16] Okay.
[1673.56 → 1679.24] So, when I got the 48 drive server, I ran into all these problems trying to create a RAID
[1679.24 → 1683.36] array because it turned out that it was capped at 12 devices.
[1683.96 → 1690.56] And I was like, well, this is a spectacularly first world problem that affects very few people.
[1690.68 → 1691.22] Like...
[1691.22 → 1692.40] Like me.
[1692.62 → 1694.42] No one else had ever brought it up to Supermicro.
[1694.50 → 1697.70] I was like, hey, so you've got this 48 drive enclosure.
[1698.42 → 1700.04] Like, how do you run all the drives together?
[1700.04 → 1702.68] And they're like, nobody's ever asked.
[1703.12 → 1705.18] And I'm like, what do you mean nobody's ever asked?
[1705.22 → 1708.34] And I'm like, well, don't take this the wrong way, Linus.
[1709.24 → 1713.74] But most of the people using a device like this kind of know what they're doing.
[1715.86 → 1717.84] I mean, they said it a lot nicer than that.
[1717.92 → 1719.56] Like, way nicer than that.
[1719.56 → 1721.92] But it was pretty savage.
[1723.24 → 1728.12] And I got all the way to, like, one of their, like, A-class support techs.
[1728.12 → 1734.76] And the guy's just like, yeah, like, we're shipping this crap to, like, you know, tier one software companies.
[1734.76 → 1738.08] Like, they've got their own proprietary crap they're running on it.
[1738.26 → 1744.50] Like, they're, like, forking Linux distros to, like, build their own freaking thing.
[1744.60 → 1748.80] And I'm like, so, like, you know, you got a number for someone over there?
[1748.86 → 1750.08] Maybe they want to hook me up for one.
[1750.50 → 1750.76] Like...
[1751.32 → 1753.18] Oh, brutal.
[1753.18 → 1755.86] Yeah, so I ended up with Windows storage spaces.
[1757.10 → 1757.54] Which is a huge problem.
[1757.54 → 1759.26] Which is working great, by the way.
[1759.32 → 1759.72] Which is a huge problem.
[1760.30 → 1761.78] Which is working great, by the way.
[1761.80 → 1762.60] Not working great.
[1762.94 → 1763.16] What?
[1763.26 → 1763.68] For me.
[1764.06 → 1764.90] What's not working great?
[1765.18 → 1767.76] I have, I've talked to multiple people about it.
[1767.84 → 1770.34] I tried to set up my system with storage spaces.
[1770.52 → 1771.02] Oh, yeah.
[1771.32 → 1771.76] Do you remember?
[1771.88 → 1774.70] Because the like, I had lots of problems with those two boards.
[1775.04 → 1777.42] The first one wouldn't boot with certain RAM configurations.
[1777.52 → 1778.56] Yeah, yeah, for your personal RAM.
[1778.56 → 1781.24] And then the second one had just no RAID setup.
[1781.52 → 1781.92] Yeah.
[1781.92 → 1783.84] It just didn't exist on the board at all.
[1784.00 → 1784.18] Yeah.
[1784.32 → 1785.92] So I was like, uh...
[1786.70 → 1787.78] I'll try storage spaces.
[1787.86 → 1789.54] And everyone was like, it'll be fine.
[1789.68 → 1789.86] Yeah.
[1789.86 → 1794.04] And it's been fine for everything except for Ubisoft games.
[1794.58 → 1795.22] Oh, really?
[1795.40 → 1796.48] Okay, well that I didn't see coming.
[1796.58 → 1797.56] Steam games launched fine.
[1797.82 → 1798.08] Yeah.
[1798.34 → 1799.30] Origin games...
[1799.30 → 1802.30] I think I've had problems with, like, one or two.
[1802.40 → 1803.88] And they were, like, super retro-y ones.
[1804.04 → 1805.02] All the new ones work fine.
[1805.44 → 1808.62] And then every single Ubisoft game doesn't work at all.
[1808.76 → 1810.46] You know, you have a NAS anyway.
[1810.46 → 1813.62] If I were you, I would just be software-rate 5 and then mirror it.
[1813.62 → 1813.98] Yeah.
[1814.08 → 1814.76] It doesn't matter.
[1815.22 → 1815.58] Yeah.
[1815.82 → 1816.80] It's just...
[1816.80 → 1818.08] It's just annoying.
[1818.14 → 1818.76] Like, why?
[1821.18 → 1823.92] Okay, we could definitely blame Ubisoft here.
[1824.92 → 1826.96] But at some degree, it's probably...
[1826.96 → 1829.74] I wouldn't be surprised if it's both sides to, like, a little bit.
[1829.90 → 1830.14] Yep.
[1830.24 → 1830.68] I don't know.
[1830.68 → 1833.16] I think your NAS also supports iSCSI.
[1833.26 → 1834.24] You could set up an iSCSI target.
[1834.44 → 1835.22] It would be totally fine.
[1835.26 → 1837.04] Yeah, that would probably do it.
[1838.52 → 1840.20] I'd be loading games off hard drives.
[1841.22 → 1842.54] Like, I don't want to put everything over there.
[1843.38 → 1844.12] Yeah, right.
[1844.28 → 1844.48] Yeah.
[1844.48 → 1848.24] Oh, this is cool.
[1848.70 → 1851.40] This was posted by the Angry Computer Masher on the forum.
[1851.48 → 1853.06] The original article is from Video Cards.
[1853.90 → 1860.64] Apparently, Thread ripper water blocks are coming, which is important because Thread ripper is also the heat ripper.
[1860.64 → 1861.08] Yeah, you can use it.
[1861.30 → 1861.54] Yeah.
[1862.58 → 1864.76] So, it's available in a variety of different colours.
[1865.06 → 1865.62] There's red.
[1865.72 → 1866.24] There's silver.
[1866.52 → 1867.78] It's a variety of sorts.
[1868.30 → 1871.14] And it's by a company called Biski.
[1871.24 → 1871.72] Biski?
[1871.84 → 1872.38] It's a Chinese...
[1872.38 → 1879.52] There are so many Chinese cases and, like, cooling manufacturers that I had never freaking heard of when I went over to Computer.
[1880.04 → 1884.34] Like, cognitively, I'm aware that there is a billion people in China.
[1884.34 → 1895.90] And, like, cognitively, I'm aware that that's as many people as there are in North America and, like, I think most of Europe combined.
[1896.82 → 1899.54] Like, cognitively, I'm aware of these things.
[1900.28 → 1908.04] So, it makes sense, then, that there would be, like, for every EK and Swift Tech...
[1908.04 → 1913.34] EK and Swift Tech, I've never heard of this company before, and I'm going to assume that they're bigger than both of them.
[1913.34 → 1914.42] It could be.
[1914.92 → 1921.94] So, for every EK and every Swift Tech, there's probably a brand that exists solely within China that's as big or bigger.
[1923.24 → 1923.86] And it's like...
[1923.86 → 1929.70] That's got to be great for that company, because then you only deal with that country's issues.
[1930.44 → 1930.88] And you're shipping...
[1930.88 → 1933.88] Although it has some pretty special issues, but...
[1933.88 → 1934.90] Right, we've learned that.
[1935.10 → 1935.30] Yeah.
[1935.94 → 1938.94] Like, apparently, there's a whole, like, bribe economy.
[1939.28 → 1940.50] In the tax system.
[1940.66 → 1940.84] Yeah.
[1940.84 → 1945.58] So, when you're paying local taxes, there's, like, bribes that you have to pay along with the taxes.
[1946.14 → 1949.36] And that can depend on, like, who the person is and what their status is.
[1949.38 → 1950.36] And it changes over time.
[1950.36 → 1951.72] Almost impossible to automate.
[1951.94 → 1952.14] Yeah.
[1952.26 → 1955.38] And, like, it's pretty sketch, actually.
[1955.54 → 1956.44] But carry on.
[1956.50 → 1958.18] But you'd probably get used to it.
[1958.22 → 1958.36] Yep.
[1958.36 → 1960.78] If you're there your whole life, you get used to it.
[1961.74 → 1964.48] And, like, shipping stuff is probably relatively simple.
[1964.66 → 1964.90] Mm-hmm.
[1964.98 → 1966.46] Not going over tons of different borders.
[1966.72 → 1967.52] Not dealing with all that...
[1967.52 → 1970.80] Although, I think the last mile is legitimately by bicycle in China.
[1970.94 → 1971.66] So, there's that.
[1971.80 → 1972.42] Not all...
[1972.42 → 1972.68] Oh.
[1973.04 → 1973.68] Not all of them.
[1974.58 → 1974.94] Yeah.
[1975.00 → 1976.90] I mean shipping to, like, stores and stuff.
[1977.04 → 1977.34] Yeah.
[1980.02 → 1981.16] But, carry on.
[1981.96 → 1983.66] Well, it's impossible that it's all of them.
[1983.78 → 1984.04] No, no.
[1984.06 → 1984.48] Okay, yes.
[1984.48 → 1985.14] Not everything.
[1985.50 → 1985.70] Yes.
[1985.82 → 1986.40] You would have...
[1986.40 → 1986.54] Yeah.
[1986.54 → 1987.34] But...
[1987.34 → 1988.50] Because, like, big apartment buildings.
[1988.64 → 1989.30] Yes, yes, yes.
[1989.56 → 1992.70] I doubt you're shipping a Thread ripper to, like, a hut.
[1994.78 → 1995.52] You know what?
[1995.78 → 1998.46] We should go on a field trip to China at some point.
[1998.52 → 1999.40] Like, I've been there now.
[1999.56 → 2000.16] You've been there, right?
[2000.16 → 2000.30] Yeah.
[2000.68 → 2003.36] But I was there for, like, 48 hours, tops.
[2003.78 → 2004.14] Similar.
[2004.44 → 2004.68] Yeah.
[2004.82 → 2005.18] Like, I didn't...
[2005.18 → 2007.54] And I was, like, in my hotel room float planning almost the entire time.
[2007.54 → 2014.24] And, like, I was in a hotel that specifically had instructions for how to bypass the Great Firewall
[2014.24 → 2014.68] of China.
[2015.24 → 2015.74] Oh, yeah.
[2015.74 → 2020.58] My only exposure to it was, like, on TV, something came on.
[2021.14 → 2023.76] And I was, like, like, I know what's behind that.
[2023.80 → 2024.92] But, like, why are you even bothering...
[2024.92 → 2026.26] Like, huh.
[2026.46 → 2030.92] Like, I couldn't even figure out why they didn't want people to know about that specific thing.
[2030.96 → 2032.04] But I was, like, oh, yeah, look at that.
[2032.08 → 2033.06] They really do censor TV.
[2033.16 → 2033.60] How about that?
[2035.90 → 2036.42] That's fun.
[2036.44 → 2042.40] But it would be interesting to just go see, like, Chinese LAN parties and, like, Chinese computer stores.
[2042.40 → 2042.42] Oh, my God.
[2042.42 → 2043.88] No, that would be super cool.
[2043.88 → 2045.46] Like, that would be pretty fun.
[2045.74 → 2049.90] Like, isn't one of NVIDIA's, like, big, like, certified LAN centres there?
[2050.08 → 2050.58] We should try to meet...
[2050.58 → 2050.80] I think so.
[2050.90 → 2058.18] And we should try to meet with, like, a big Chinese, like, computer hardware reviewing group.
[2058.50 → 2058.86] Yeah.
[2060.34 → 2061.34] That would be very interesting.
[2061.54 → 2062.32] And, like, just see what they do.
[2062.40 → 2062.76] Just be like...
[2062.76 → 2063.66] Do, like, a studio channel.
[2063.66 → 2064.32] Oh, what's up.
[2064.40 → 2064.68] Yeah.
[2064.82 → 2065.02] Yeah.
[2065.44 → 2068.18] Like, how do hardware reviews work in China?
[2068.24 → 2068.50] Because, like, honestly...
[2069.02 → 2070.46] And, like, what are your big brands?
[2070.54 → 2070.74] Yeah.
[2070.86 → 2072.70] Like, the truly global manufacturers.
[2072.86 → 2073.84] The guys like Intel.
[2074.20 → 2074.40] Yeah.
[2074.46 → 2075.66] Like, they could put us in touch.
[2075.74 → 2075.88] Yeah.
[2075.92 → 2076.30] For sure.
[2076.82 → 2081.02] AMD would probably be easier, actually, because they're less segmented from region to region.
[2081.02 → 2081.06] Right.
[2081.06 → 2082.56] Because they're a smaller company.
[2084.40 → 2086.02] You know, because they haven't had a great five years.
[2087.56 → 2088.14] But, yeah.
[2088.26 → 2090.02] Like, someone like AMD could probably be like, yeah.
[2090.10 → 2091.78] Like, here are the guys who matter in China.
[2092.12 → 2092.66] Be like, yeah.
[2092.74 → 2093.84] That would be fascinating.
[2094.36 → 2096.06] I wonder if we'd be able to get a visa for that.
[2096.84 → 2098.28] It's media, so it would be harder.
[2098.52 → 2098.80] Yeah.
[2099.56 → 2102.56] But maybe we could make it meetings or something.
[2102.62 → 2107.00] Speaking of visas, get out your wallet, because it's sponsor time!
[2107.00 → 2110.00] Come on, that was pretty good.
[2110.60 → 2111.00] That was alright.
[2111.12 → 2116.30] Mack Weldon believes in smart design, premium fabric, and simple shopping.
[2116.54 → 2117.18] And you know what?
[2117.60 → 2119.70] It's one thing to say they believe in it.
[2120.34 → 2123.44] But they actually, like, do care about it and do that.
[2123.92 → 2128.54] Because, like, you know, I could say Linus Media Group believes in high production values.
[2128.94 → 2132.68] But when push comes to shove, you know, we release a video every day.
[2132.90 → 2134.12] So, um...
[2134.12 → 2136.14] Organization vlog!
[2136.14 → 2139.68] We believe in relatively high production.
[2139.74 → 2139.88] Yeah.
[2140.00 → 2144.82] Mack Weldon will be the most comfortable underwear, socks, shirts, undershirts, hoodies, and sweatpants
[2144.82 → 2145.58] that you will ever wear.
[2145.64 → 2146.68] That is their guarantee.
[2147.32 → 2150.32] And this is, like, the coolest thing about their lineup.
[2150.76 → 2156.12] They have a line of silver underwear and shirts that are naturally antimicrobial,
[2156.30 → 2159.86] which means that they don't stink the way that regular shirts do.
[2160.00 → 2163.80] Before you said that, someone in the chat said, antimicrobial, yes.
[2164.80 → 2165.94] Antimicrobial, yes!
[2166.14 → 2167.34] Look bad?
[2167.58 → 2168.16] No!

[2196.62 → 2198.02] I don't know where you're going right now.
[2198.68 → 2198.90] Nope.
[2199.00 → 2199.40] No, none of that.
[2199.44 → 2200.56] Oh, these are for us, though.
[2200.56 → 2201.86] We get to play with these during the next spot.
[2202.10 → 2202.42] That's...

[2237.08 → 2237.92] No escalations.
[2238.04 → 2240.36] They're all trained up, and there's no phone tree.
[2240.50 → 2241.32] Nothing like that.

[2249.54 → 2252.56] Did I say it was a 30-day free trial?
[2253.64 → 2262.94] Speaking of free trials, you and I got a huge variety of Spectrum glasses to try out, and I am planning to wear mine for the rest of the show.
[2263.00 → 2263.60] I don't know about you.
[2263.74 → 2264.34] Okay, I'm down.
[2264.84 → 2265.88] I am totally down.
[2266.06 → 2267.18] I've picked mine already.
[2267.28 → 2268.54] I actually checked out all of them.
[2268.68 → 2269.08] Oh, really?
[2269.28 → 2269.76] Oh, well...
[2269.76 → 2270.34] Those are kids.
[2271.02 → 2271.44] Oh, really?
[2271.62 → 2271.78] Oh, okay.
[2271.78 → 2274.52] So you can try that, and I think these are more for ladies.
[2275.22 → 2275.76] You know what?
[2276.14 → 2276.60] You know what?
[2276.88 → 2277.28] Cat eyes.
[2277.28 → 2277.94] I'll try them on.
[2277.94 → 2278.04] All right.
[2278.04 → 2279.94] So they got a bunch of different styles here.
[2280.16 → 2280.84] I'll try the kids' one.
[2280.96 → 2281.52] This is artist.
[2282.20 → 2283.96] You're not going to fit the kids' one.
[2283.98 → 2284.48] I'm going to try it.
[2284.76 → 2285.04] All right.
[2285.10 → 2286.40] So this is the artist style.
[2286.62 → 2287.38] Oh, my God.
[2287.42 → 2288.04] They're amazing.
[2288.32 → 2289.30] You know what's funny?
[2289.94 → 2291.04] They even have, like, rubbery ends.
[2291.04 → 2292.12] Oh, those are adorable!
[2294.48 → 2295.18] Heck, yeah.
[2296.34 → 2297.20] These are awesome.
[2297.22 → 2300.18] You know what's so funny about, like, hipster people?
[2301.84 → 2303.90] Hey, they've got the, uh, they're double-jointed.
[2304.00 → 2305.86] So that when they drop them or sit on them or whatever.
[2305.86 → 2308.28] And even the ends are all flexible and stuff.
[2308.50 → 2308.76] Okay.
[2308.98 → 2317.32] The funny thing about hipster, like, artist people are that these were legitimately what my grandma was wearing in the late 90s.
[2318.32 → 2321.42] Now, that's a cool, trendy thing for young people.
[2321.76 → 2323.96] Because that's how it works, apparently.
[2323.96 → 2325.52] I'm liking these.
[2325.56 → 2326.42] I'll wear these for the rest.
[2326.50 → 2329.10] I actually, I'm down for, I'm down for the hipster.
[2329.34 → 2336.72] I'm down for the hipster, like, uh, because they got, like, the, the, the yellow and black kind of alternating kind of pattern around them.
[2336.80 → 2337.02] See that?
[2337.02 → 2338.46] It actually looks pretty good on you.
[2338.54 → 2338.78] Right?
[2339.02 → 2339.28] Right?
[2339.86 → 2340.94] Those look good on you, too, actually.
[2340.94 → 2342.70] I think they're slightly too round.
[2342.98 → 2346.96] But when you're looking at the like, this pattern, it looks perfect on you.
[2347.08 → 2347.36] Cool.
[2347.60 → 2347.76] Yeah.
[2347.80 → 2348.82] Well, I'm happy to be trendy.
[2348.96 → 2353.98] Anyway, the point is, spectrum glasses are for folks who stare at a monitor all day.
[2354.08 → 2356.46] They filter the blue light, but let through the yellow.
[2356.46 → 2361.10] And they are meant to make it more comfortable to be using a screen all day.
[2361.50 → 2366.88] Some monitors do have a blue light mode, but that's only really gotten popular within the last few years.
[2367.04 → 2375.56] So there are literally millions, tens of millions of monitors and laptops, actually, out there that do not have a mode like that.
[2375.56 → 2380.86] And while there are software solutions, it is not the same type of filtering that these do.
[2381.48 → 2382.34] They're stylish.
[2382.70 → 2383.80] That's one of their talking points.
[2383.96 → 2385.38] We'll let you guys be the judge.
[2387.46 → 2388.58] So they're stylish.
[2388.90 → 2393.44] They have low colour distortion and, well, highest rated among competitors on Amazon.
[2393.84 → 2399.46] So they're primarily focused on the Canadian and U.S. markets, but they're expanding to Europe, and they offer international shipping.
[2399.82 → 2403.56] So check them out over at spectrumglasses.com slash collection slash products.
[2403.64 → 2404.92] We really need a better vanity URL.
[2405.18 → 2408.52] And you can get 10% off using offer code Linus.
[2410.32 → 2410.84] Okay.
[2411.22 → 2411.92] All right.
[2412.10 → 2412.76] So let's see.
[2412.82 → 2414.02] What else we got here?
[2414.02 → 2415.24] Or a float.
[2415.24 → 2416.42] We got news?
[2416.52 → 2416.88] Oh, yeah.
[2417.10 → 2417.40] Oh, yeah.
[2417.46 → 2417.64] Cool.
[2417.70 → 2418.86] What's up on Flow plane right now?
[2420.48 → 2421.82] Oh, I never logged in.
[2421.82 → 2424.48] While you're giving that up, I can talk about this.
[2424.72 → 2426.64] I don't think we need anything on screen for this necessarily.
[2427.20 → 2430.12] Discord is announcing video chat and screen sharing.
[2430.12 → 2436.42] Although one big thing that's going to lack on this launch is there won't be any audio pass-through for the screen sharing.
[2436.54 → 2438.78] Although I don't necessarily know if I care all that much.
[2439.04 → 2439.22] Hmm.
[2440.22 → 2442.14] I'm sure it matters to a certain degree.
[2442.20 → 2447.82] Is that like something where they're running into like DRM sort of restrictions possibly?
[2448.30 → 2448.40] Oh.
[2448.40 → 2449.74] They're passing the video through.
[2450.14 → 2450.44] Yeah.
[2450.52 → 2453.60] But if they can't pass the audio, like that.
[2453.90 → 2454.72] It's less likely.
[2454.72 → 2458.96] It would make the group movie watching experience a little less likely.
[2459.18 → 2459.44] I could.
[2459.66 → 2459.92] Maybe.
[2460.12 → 2460.38] I don't know.
[2460.38 → 2460.62] I don't know.
[2460.62 → 2461.12] I'm just guessing.
[2461.34 → 2461.86] I think Skype does it, though.
[2461.92 → 2462.54] I'm just guessing.
[2462.92 → 2463.04] So.
[2463.18 → 2465.28] But then Skype maybe has a bigger legal team or something.
[2465.44 → 2465.92] I don't know.
[2466.30 → 2471.62] They are saying now friends on Discord can watch each other play their favourite games while talking face-to-face.
[2471.62 → 2472.52] That sounds weird.
[2472.72 → 2474.44] I don't know if that's really going to be a thing.
[2474.88 → 2477.34] But it might be a lot easier for streamers, which is.
[2477.34 → 2478.14] Maybe you're just getting old.
[2478.92 → 2479.24] Maybe.
[2479.62 → 2479.90] Oh.
[2480.12 → 2480.92] That's possible.
[2481.60 → 2484.10] I could see it being a much bigger thing for streamers.
[2484.48 → 2491.70] Discord already has streamer mode and like ties into Twitch where you can have all your subscribers in your Twitch channel and all this kind of stuff.
[2491.70 → 2497.82] And if you can have voice and video calls, streamers can have like a streaming room and be in streaming mode.
[2498.02 → 2498.10] Right.
[2498.16 → 2498.94] And all that kind of stuff.
[2499.12 → 2503.62] And use that instead of like Skype for playing, doing streams collaboratively.
[2503.74 → 2503.96] Right.
[2503.96 → 2505.30] Which makes a lot of sense.
[2506.32 → 2506.86] All right.
[2506.92 → 2509.42] I've got a lot of good stuff on Float plane this week, actually.
[2509.80 → 2513.00] We've got the cheapest PC case on the market.
[2513.32 → 2514.08] Oh, man.
[2514.18 → 2514.84] We found it.
[2515.10 → 2517.32] We hot-rodded the snot out of it.
[2517.44 → 2518.20] It's actually awesome.
[2518.68 → 2520.84] That looks really cool, actually.
[2521.10 → 2522.62] It's actually sick.
[2522.84 → 2524.00] Alex did a great job.
[2524.70 → 2527.96] I love how now that we have like Alex and these other guys.
[2528.12 → 2528.26] Yeah.
[2528.30 → 2529.42] It's like, oh, this thing sucks.
[2529.42 → 2535.04] We'll like to tear the trash out of it and like make fun of it and then make it awesome because we're just going to mod the hell out of it.
[2535.04 → 2535.64] That's right, baby.
[2535.88 → 2536.56] That's super cool.
[2536.56 → 2540.32] 4K gaming at 120 hertz on a DIY monitor.
[2541.18 → 2541.56] What?
[2541.56 → 2542.50] Yeah, baby.
[2543.34 → 2544.72] Wait, did you make that?
[2544.90 → 2545.86] It's a kit.
[2546.40 → 2546.76] Okay.
[2546.86 → 2547.44] That's cool.
[2547.66 → 2549.78] Unboxing the real Racer toaster.
[2551.52 → 2551.90] Nice.
[2551.90 → 2556.72] Is NVIDIA ruining your performance by sandbagging their drivers?
[2557.24 → 2559.32] Oh, that's a trigger video.
[2559.56 → 2561.90] I know, I know, but it had to be done.
[2562.22 → 2562.56] Of course.
[2562.76 → 2563.84] It had to be done.
[2565.06 → 2566.28] We've got a couple of other things.
[2566.32 → 2569.50] We've got a lot of behind-the-scenes vlogs and stuff like that.
[2569.60 → 2570.98] We've got a couple tech quickies.
[2572.64 → 2574.04] Crappiest Decal I set up of all time.
[2574.22 → 2581.18] We've had a lot of simultaneous releases lately, so it's pushed out some pretty old videos that have been taking a while to make their way to the platform.
[2581.18 → 2582.62] But we've got some perfect stuff coming.
[2582.62 → 2584.82] But kind of in place of that, there has been a lot of-
[2584.82 → 2585.96] Oh, sounds on.
[2586.24 → 2589.34] There has been a lot of the moving stuff and whatnot.
[2589.86 → 2597.46] I've actually got one more vlog, and then I'm going to start doing some meet-the-team pieces, because people have asked for proper intros to some of the new people.
[2598.10 → 2599.20] You know what's interesting?
[2599.36 → 2607.52] Talking about stuff on YouTube now that did really well on Float plane as well, and if you were on Float plane, you would have seen it earlier, is the Pippin video.
[2607.98 → 2608.34] Yeah!
[2608.80 → 2609.72] Did really well.
[2609.78 → 2610.48] People love that.
[2610.48 → 2611.70] It's still going, too.
[2611.82 → 2612.94] It's beating the Thread ripper.
[2613.04 → 2615.80] 1.1 million views on-
[2615.80 → 2616.24] Maybe-
[2616.24 → 2617.72] Did it help that we had a sealed-
[2617.72 → 2620.20] Some people were pretty salty that we opened that thing, hey?
[2620.64 → 2620.92] Really?
[2621.12 → 2621.44] Yeah.
[2621.88 → 2622.48] They were like,
[2623.08 → 2625.74] That was vintage and-
[2625.74 → 2627.12] And I see their point.
[2627.24 → 2628.48] Like, it was not sealed.
[2628.56 → 2631.40] It's not like you can make a new not-sealed one.
[2631.76 → 2633.12] I don't really agree with that.
[2633.18 → 2634.08] But we didn't damage it.
[2634.08 → 2637.62] I collect old games and stuff, but in my opinion, they're there to be played.
[2638.54 → 2642.40] Yeah, see, that's a philosophical thing, though, that a lot of collectors-
[2642.40 → 2644.80] Like, okay, so this is-
[2644.80 → 2648.24] I hear, like, I know that there is a lot of people that view it this way.
[2648.24 → 2649.36] I just don't, personally.
[2649.40 → 2650.36] So it's a stupid tangent.
[2651.16 → 2654.40] One of my wife's friend's daughter is turning one.
[2655.16 → 2655.42] Okay.
[2655.56 → 2664.14] And so, Yvonne is getting for her daughter something that's really for her mom, because, like, what does a one-year-old do with a toy?
[2664.38 → 2664.88] Eat it.
[2664.88 → 2668.54] And she started collecting Polly Pockets.
[2668.62 → 2670.42] Do you remember Polly Pocket and Mighty Max?
[2670.90 → 2671.98] Oh, you're younger than I.
[2672.04 → 2672.12] I know, too.
[2672.12 → 2674.32] No, I know, like, people that I knew were-
[2674.32 → 2674.64] I hate you.
[2675.24 → 2675.60] Wrong.
[2675.74 → 2677.52] People that I knew were into it.
[2677.96 → 2679.08] I wasn't.
[2679.28 → 2679.94] I don't know.
[2680.16 → 2680.46] Okay, well-
[2680.46 → 2682.06] But, like, kids my age were into that stuff.
[2682.12 → 2682.60] Okay, fine.
[2683.38 → 2684.64] So anyway, she's-
[2684.64 → 2684.66] I don't know.
[2684.66 → 2690.16] Just for, like, for loss, she started collecting Polly Pockets, and she has a little, like, thing for them and stuff.
[2690.44 → 2694.86] And I was looking into it, and Polly Pockets and Mighty Max,
[2694.88 → 2703.78] for that matter, are one of those toys where I can legitimately see how the sealed one would have a lot more value than the non-sealed one,
[2703.84 → 2709.60] because the pieces are so small, and there's- it's really hard to track down exactly what they're supposed to come with.
[2710.00 → 2712.02] But that's a lot of value to sell.
[2712.48 → 2712.82] Yes.
[2713.92 → 2714.92] So, tell me this-
[2714.92 → 2717.90] But what if I bought it to play with it, and not to sell it?
[2718.04 → 2721.00] If you collected Mighty Max, let's say, for example.
[2721.28 → 2721.52] Okay.
[2721.52 → 2721.82] You know what?
[2721.90 → 2723.28] No, let's say you collected Polly Pocket.
[2723.28 → 2723.98] I'm not judging.
[2723.98 → 2725.02] I'm just saying.
[2725.02 → 2725.06] Sure.
[2725.06 → 2725.46] No, that's cool.
[2725.46 → 2726.22] That's probably what you would collect.
[2726.50 → 2726.78] Okay.
[2727.56 → 2728.22] Either way.
[2728.62 → 2733.68] Would you buy some-would you collect something like that to sell, or would that be more of a display piece?
[2734.44 → 2735.10] Like, if you collected toys-
[2735.10 → 2739.46] I mean, if I'm collecting it to sell, then in my opinion, that's a business.
[2739.66 → 2741.08] What if you collected it just to own it?
[2742.00 → 2743.00] Because that's a third.
[2743.20 → 2744.90] That I would want to do something with it.
[2745.02 → 2745.98] You would want to do something with it.
[2745.98 → 2747.72] I would want to play with my little Polly Pocket.
[2747.72 → 2755.36] So you would take it out of the package, even if it's just to put it on a nice display case and create a little scene of a still life thing.
[2755.36 → 2756.06] And I have done that.
[2756.06 → 2760.22] Because I have the Halo's Master Chief helmet on a stand.
[2760.38 → 2761.32] That's out of its packaging.
[2761.32 → 2766.82] I have the Dragon born fighting a dragon statue thing from Skyrim.
[2767.04 → 2767.28] Okay.
[2767.40 → 2768.52] I have Soldier 76.
[2769.30 → 2773.28] I have Master Sword in a Stone.
[2774.20 → 2777.74] I have the chick from Horizon Zero Dawn.
[2777.90 → 2781.10] I have a few little statue-y kind of thingies that are kind of around my house.
[2781.40 → 2782.32] I think they look really cool.
[2782.58 → 2788.32] If they were in their box, it would be the Game Box or Plain White Foam.
[2789.32 → 2789.68] Okay.
[2789.84 → 2790.16] All right.
[2790.24 → 2790.64] Fair enough.
[2790.64 → 2792.34] Which sounds super lame.
[2792.46 → 2808.20] Honestly, looking at these Mighty Max's and Polly Pockets, man, I think there's a legitimate business model there of just buying, like, actually huge quantities of, like, every toy.
[2808.32 → 2808.74] Go ahead.
[2808.82 → 2811.76] But, like, I'm the person that's buying it and then using it.
[2811.76 → 2811.94] Right.
[2812.96 → 2813.42] Because, like...
[2813.42 → 2814.88] If you want to buy it to resell it, sure.
[2815.04 → 2815.88] Nostalgia, man.
[2816.46 → 2817.96] Like, as my kids are growing up...
[2817.96 → 2819.40] Who has nostalgia of a Pippin?
[2819.40 → 2821.96] Yeah, I guess that's a fair point.
[2822.02 → 2827.58] Like, a maximum of 42,000 people if everyone loved it.
[2827.58 → 2828.10] Loved it, yeah.
[2828.18 → 2831.22] And I, like, pretty much guarantee that's not what happened.
[2831.22 → 2837.22] So, I'm kind of thinking, okay, this is our next...
[2837.76 → 2838.86] Investing in Billy Pocket?
[2838.86 → 2840.58] Yeah, forget this Linus Media Group thing.
[2840.58 → 2841.06] Yeah, screw it.
[2841.06 → 2842.48] Okay, you and I, just...
[2842.48 → 2843.42] No one else is listening, right?
[2843.42 → 2843.58] Cool.
[2843.68 → 2844.70] Yeah, no, I'm in on this.
[2844.84 → 2845.00] I'm in.
[2845.00 → 2846.80] Okay, so you and I are going to go into business.
[2846.88 → 2847.10] Okay.
[2847.10 → 2849.32] We're just going to find cheap storage space.
[2849.58 → 2849.92] Nice.
[2850.04 → 2851.06] And every new...
[2851.06 → 2853.44] I mean, someone's probably selling theirs now that we're out of this.
[2853.46 → 2854.12] Right, right.
[2854.30 → 2854.52] Okay.
[2855.06 → 2860.06] Every new stupid, crappy trend, we buy, like, a pallet of it.
[2860.48 → 2860.88] Perfect.
[2861.08 → 2861.34] Okay?
[2861.42 → 2862.42] We buy a pallet of it.
[2862.52 → 2862.74] Heck, yeah.
[2862.74 → 2865.90] We just store it all Indiana Jones warehouse style, okay?
[2866.46 → 2868.68] And then we just wait for 20 years.
[2868.76 → 2873.62] Because I kid you not, like, sealed Polly Pockets, we're going for, like, $800.
[2874.24 → 2874.60] Oof.
[2874.92 → 2875.18] Yeah.
[2875.44 → 2877.78] We're talking a 10x increase in value.
[2878.04 → 2881.64] Over 20 years, that's actually a not freaking bad return.
[2882.28 → 2882.74] That's not bad.
[2882.80 → 2883.84] You just got to nail it every time.
[2884.08 → 2885.14] You don't even have to.
[2885.40 → 2888.42] If you get it right half of the time.
[2889.66 → 2893.06] And you can probably flip it for something the other parts of the time.
[2893.20 → 2893.60] Exactly.
[2893.92 → 2894.98] It's like something like...
[2894.98 → 2898.00] A perfect business model right now, actually, which is kind of frustrating.
[2898.18 → 2898.44] Hit me.
[2898.44 → 2905.74] Is making, like, advertising more aggressively and getting better SEO using trendier websites
[2905.74 → 2909.16] than companies that are actually doing what they're supposed to be doing and just buying
[2909.16 → 2910.18] knock offs from China.
[2911.38 → 2913.72] Like, there was this new bra thing.
[2914.46 → 2917.38] It's like kind of sticker, and then you pull the thing in, and it pulls...
[2917.38 → 2918.18] I don't know how it works.
[2918.26 → 2918.64] I don't get it.
[2918.68 → 2920.64] Oh, it's like the strapless push-up bra, right?
[2920.68 → 2920.92] Yeah.
[2921.10 → 2921.36] Yeah, yeah.
[2921.36 → 2924.72] There were a lot of online pop-up shops that happened.
[2924.98 → 2928.10] And it's essentially like little mall kiosks, but on the internet.
[2928.80 → 2930.44] And they just pop up with crazy SEO.
[2930.76 → 2934.70] They advertise through, like, Facebook and YouTube super aggressively.
[2935.10 → 2935.42] Mm-hmm.
[2935.42 → 2938.92] Like, really, really aggressively so that they're always in your newsfeed, and you're just like,
[2939.00 → 2940.18] oh, I've seen this advertised everywhere.
[2940.32 → 2943.10] I guess that's the one that I've seen that people are talking about.
[2943.18 → 2944.48] I guess I'll just buy that one.
[2945.08 → 2945.86] And you just make it something...
[2945.86 → 2945.88] Huh.
[2945.88 → 2950.00] If it's just super generic, you just buy a crap ton of them, ship them over on, like,
[2950.00 → 2953.60] a drop-ship, and then just throw up a bunch of different...
[2953.60 → 2956.62] You could even have one company that just has, like, a hundred websites.
[2956.76 → 2957.20] They're all essentially the same.
[2957.20 → 2959.72] There are a lot of, like, sleeve, crappy ways to make money, aren't there?
[2959.82 → 2960.02] Yeah.
[2960.02 → 2962.48] Some people are bringing up fidget spinners in the Twitch chat.
[2962.64 → 2966.60] And honestly, here's what I would kind of tell you.
[2966.70 → 2968.82] Because I think they were being kind of sarcastic.
[2969.68 → 2971.50] But here's the thing.
[2972.62 → 2975.52] And some of you might not be old enough to appreciate this yet.
[2976.06 → 2979.98] But nothing is as good now as it was when I was a kid.
[2980.62 → 2982.68] And I actually mean that objectively.
[2983.26 → 2988.66] Wagon wheels would be a perfect example of a candy that was delicious and tastes like utter trash now.
[2988.66 → 2991.80] But, like, there's actually been changes to the recipe.
[2992.06 → 2992.34] Yes.
[2993.04 → 2995.02] Honey Nut Cheerios are another example.
[2995.20 → 2995.72] Oh, my God.
[2995.72 → 2998.22] When I was, like, six, they were awesome.
[2998.44 → 2998.88] They destroyed those.
[2998.92 → 3000.24] They killed Honey Nut Cheerios.
[3000.42 → 3000.58] Yeah.
[3000.66 → 3006.02] Like, poor Marquez, who loves his Honey Nut Cheerios so much, has never even tasted Honey Nut Cheerios.
[3006.04 → 3007.24] I had the good old days ones.
[3007.52 → 3007.92] Okay.
[3008.08 → 3008.76] So, anyway.
[3009.62 → 3012.16] Here's what will happen with something like fidget spinners.
[3012.28 → 3014.90] They'll come back, but they'll be crappier.
[3014.90 → 3020.30] So, if you bought a bunch of cheap ones today, that would be a bad play.
[3020.66 → 3024.44] But if you bought a bunch of, like, premium and specialty ones.
[3024.74 → 3026.60] Like, a bunch of, like, cool ones.
[3026.76 → 3030.66] Or ones with, like, timeless branding.
[3031.10 → 3032.92] Like, I don't know if Pokémon is timeless.
[3032.92 → 3036.84] But something like, oh, man.
[3036.98 → 3038.28] I don't know about, like, Toy Story.
[3038.48 → 3040.62] But, like, Gun dam branding.
[3040.76 → 3044.68] Like, some kind of really resilient anime or something like that.
[3044.92 → 3047.90] A really high quality one from, like, a reputable maker.
[3048.64 → 3052.40] A palette or two of those would be worth a gold mine 20 years from now.
[3052.40 → 3053.24] I'm sure of it.
[3053.26 → 3056.46] I wonder if even, like, Dude Perfect ones.
[3057.24 → 3057.64] No.
[3058.18 → 3058.58] Okay.
[3059.12 → 3060.44] Nothing against Dude Perfect.
[3060.96 → 3063.84] But I wouldn't bet on any YouTuber, including ourselves.
[3064.36 → 3065.62] Because they're too short-lived?
[3065.74 → 3067.90] It's potentially too flash in the pen.
[3068.08 → 3068.28] Right.
[3068.50 → 3072.16] And you look at every YouTuber has what I call the curve.
[3072.78 → 3073.42] Where they go.
[3073.58 → 3073.72] Yeah.
[3074.00 → 3074.50] They go like.
[3074.56 → 3074.70] Sorry.
[3074.74 → 3075.70] I'm going to go across your face.
[3075.70 → 3076.66] Because I was right behind the thing.
[3076.66 → 3077.78] Where they go like this.
[3077.90 → 3079.44] Everybody grows really slow at the beginning.
[3079.54 → 3081.68] Because that's the nature of the algorithm.
[3081.98 → 3082.84] And then they grow.
[3083.58 → 3084.42] And then they plateau.
[3084.42 → 3086.66] And then they decline.
[3086.78 → 3088.14] And sometimes it's a slow decline.
[3088.26 → 3089.82] And sometimes some come back.
[3090.18 → 3090.82] Phil DeFranco.
[3090.96 → 3091.50] I, Justine.
[3091.62 → 3095.14] These are examples of creators that bucked the curve.
[3095.48 → 3098.80] And you can also just kind of flat.
[3099.06 → 3099.24] Yep.
[3099.26 → 3100.82] And then manage to come back up again.
[3100.90 → 3101.48] And then you'll flat.
[3101.70 → 3102.46] And then you'll come up again.
[3102.50 → 3103.00] And then you'll flat.
[3103.08 → 3103.22] Yep.
[3103.72 → 3106.82] But that curve, I've seen it so many times.
[3106.82 → 3109.14] And there can be a thousand reasons.
[3109.60 → 3109.88] Oh, yeah.
[3109.88 → 3110.86] Got into TV.
[3111.28 → 3111.54] Yep.
[3111.68 → 3112.90] Just lost their passion.
[3112.90 → 3114.46] Team fell apart.
[3114.84 → 3115.60] Got bored.
[3117.34 → 3120.18] Decided to form an MCN.
[3120.46 → 3123.18] Didn't adjust with the current, like, meta.
[3123.36 → 3124.08] Didn't adjust.
[3124.34 → 3125.42] Didn't change their thumbnails.
[3125.68 → 3126.80] Just didn't care anymore.
[3126.86 → 3131.24] Like, there's a thousand reasons why people fade off the platform.
[3131.24 → 3146.14] But I have seen very few examples of turning your platform success once you are no longer supporting the YouTube audience into some kind of actual sustainable off-platform success.
[3146.14 → 3150.46] I think Harley from Epic Mealtime would be an example.
[3150.46 → 3158.78] But I do have to wonder if his fortunes today would actually be even better if he had stuck with YouTube for longer.
[3158.78 → 3167.62] Because YouTube is kind of like the investment phase of a modern web video production business.
[3167.62 → 3170.76] It's like where you're burning money.
[3170.90 → 3172.22] It's like when you've got your seed funding.
[3172.34 → 3174.62] And the funding might just be your own time.
[3174.84 → 3174.94] Yeah.
[3175.10 → 3178.30] But that's where you're investing into the business, and you're growing the audience.
[3178.80 → 3184.00] And then there's, like, a monetization phase where people might try to go off-platform.
[3184.00 → 3187.82] Or they might try to open a merch store.
[3188.04 → 3193.42] Or they might try to do PewDiePie's mobile game where they try to monetize in other ways.
[3193.56 → 3200.90] If PewDiePie spent all his damn time on his mobile game, then the plateau would happen.
[3201.04 → 3208.92] Because the YouTube audience and investing into that audience and growing it is how you open up new opportunities for all that other stuff down the line.
[3208.92 → 3218.44] And basically, the second you stop focusing on YouTube, that's where you start to see a decline, generally speaking.
[3218.60 → 3220.80] Some people are like, uh, this guy?
[3221.12 → 3222.54] Because you didn't, like, call them out.
[3222.66 → 3224.46] Like, yeah, not the point.
[3225.00 → 3227.56] Yeah, the point isn't any particular individual right now.
[3227.66 → 3230.90] This is a greater observation about the platform.
[3234.54 → 3237.62] Anyway, I feel like we've gotten a little off-topic.
[3237.62 → 3239.80] This was posted by Mr. Troll on the forum.
[3239.88 → 3245.40] The original article is from WCCF Tech, so you can take it with a grain of WCCF Tech.
[3245.72 → 3252.70] But AMD is rumoured to be building, once again, a dual AMD top-of-the-line GPU card.
[3253.22 → 3255.14] Which would surprise me a lot.
[3255.78 → 3263.34] But apparently, they're going to throw a couple of Vega 10 XTs on a single graphics card.
[3263.52 → 3263.84] Really?
[3265.28 → 3265.72] Wow.
[3265.72 → 3269.72] Apparently, nearly 600 watts of power draw, because...
[3269.72 → 3270.32] YOLO?
[3270.56 → 3271.02] I guess.
[3273.72 → 3275.62] Um, wow.
[3275.82 → 3279.18] I would recommend not buying it, if they make it.
[3280.36 → 3280.80] Pugh.
[3282.40 → 3283.62] Like, directly.
[3283.62 → 3288.50] And that's the end of that chapter.
[3288.50 → 3293.38] Um, over 50 teraflops of FP16 compute.
[3294.02 → 3296.72] 25 teraflops of FP32 compute.
[3296.82 → 3299.64] So this thing is like, it's almost like a workstation card.
[3299.88 → 3303.82] Except that they're going to Ares Gamer brand it up to the 9.
[3303.82 → 3305.94] And it's 600 watts per single card.
[3306.94 → 3307.70] You know...
[3307.70 → 3308.66] And you can just put two.
[3308.66 → 3313.14] The power supply makers have to be just giddy right now.
[3313.50 → 3313.82] Oh, yeah.
[3314.04 → 3315.66] Because for the first time...
[3316.24 → 3317.04] In quite a few years.
[3317.10 → 3317.14] Ever.
[3317.70 → 3321.48] A 1500 watt power supply might actually be necessary.
[3322.04 → 3323.24] Like, I'm serious.
[3323.66 → 3324.66] If you went 18...
[3324.66 → 3325.30] 18...
[3325.30 → 3327.50] From what I'm hearing, rumour-wise...
[3327.50 → 3329.76] An 18-core Core i9...
[3329.76 → 3331.42] But who's doing this?
[3331.58 → 3332.26] Just hold on.
[3332.36 → 3332.66] Hold on.
[3332.68 → 3333.46] That's what I don't...
[3333.46 → 3334.12] No, no, no, no.
[3334.18 → 3334.76] Hold up.
[3334.88 → 3335.70] That's what I don't understand.
[3336.08 → 3339.04] These new processors that everyone's pushing in the consumer space...
[3339.04 → 3340.54] Are not consumer processors.
[3342.44 → 3343.18] I don't...
[3343.18 → 3346.60] Like, I don't understand why everyone, like, on Reddit and all this kind of stuff...
[3346.60 → 3348.18] Is freaking out over these processors.
[3349.08 → 3349.48] Who's...
[3349.48 → 3350.46] Why are you buying...
[3350.46 → 3351.48] Are you buying this?
[3351.78 → 3352.92] Why are you buying this?
[3353.60 → 3354.68] It's not for you.
[3355.78 → 3356.80] It's not for me.
[3357.88 → 3358.52] Okay, hold on.
[3358.52 → 3359.62] Why does anyone care?
[3359.70 → 3359.96] Okay, let me...
[3359.96 → 3363.76] You could have used a computer with that much wattage before if you just bought server parts.
[3363.78 → 3364.24] Okay, let me jump.
[3364.32 → 3364.60] Let me jump.
[3365.14 → 3366.66] I'm going to let you finish, but...
[3366.66 → 3367.30] I'm going to let...
[3367.30 → 3368.60] You can go ahead.
[3368.66 → 3368.76] Okay.
[3368.76 → 3369.82] It's just so stupid.
[3370.04 → 3370.40] I don't...
[3370.40 → 3370.74] I don't know.
[3370.76 → 3372.00] It's a chicken-and-egg thing, though.
[3372.00 → 3378.00] Will we ever get software development that is really and truly honestly multithreaded...
[3378.00 → 3380.76] If it doesn't come to the high end...
[3380.76 → 3381.80] I think we're gonna wait for consoles.
[3381.80 → 3383.00] And eventually trickle down.
[3383.64 → 3384.70] I think we're gonna wait for consoles.
[3384.70 → 3385.12] To consoles.
[3385.58 → 3385.84] Yeah.
[3386.42 → 3388.24] But it's gotta start somewhere.
[3389.04 → 3392.78] So can't we be excited just for the beginning of it even if we don't buy it?
[3392.78 → 3394.64] Knight's Corner is like old as hell now.
[3394.80 → 3395.32] That's true.
[3395.40 → 3401.78] But Knight's Corner didn't have single-threaded performance like these new ones do.
[3401.80 → 3402.28] That's true.
[3403.24 → 3403.64] But like...
[3403.64 → 3404.24] These are like...
[3404.24 → 3405.10] They're the.
[3405.10 → 3408.32] So when people are like, ugh, that one's too expensive.
[3408.54 → 3409.94] It's like, are you going to buy the other one?
[3410.00 → 3412.20] Is that one more affordable for you?
[3412.22 → 3413.22] This is they have your cake...
[3413.22 → 3414.08] It's still in the red.
[3414.20 → 3414.88] And eat it to product.
[3414.96 → 3415.42] But okay.
[3415.64 → 3416.64] But think about it this way, too.
[3416.66 → 3417.74] What about the used market?
[3418.32 → 3419.36] Three years from now...
[3419.36 → 3422.38] The used market on a $2,000 processor?
[3422.38 → 3422.64] Yeah.
[3422.88 → 3425.60] But it would be like, you know, $600.
[3426.50 → 3427.70] Because we've seen the curve.
[3427.78 → 3428.52] In three years?
[3428.54 → 3428.90] Yeah.
[3429.14 → 3429.68] Maybe four.
[3430.58 → 3431.64] But it would be cheaper.
[3431.90 → 3432.48] It would be cheaper.
[3432.88 → 3435.42] At least the process is finally starting.
[3435.50 → 3437.70] Because here's the thing for the power supply makers.
[3438.30 → 3444.52] For all this time, they've had a product that has no legitimate purpose.
[3444.52 → 3448.22] They tried to be the first one out so they're like, everyone else can now make things that need more wanted.
[3448.22 → 3448.94] Whatsoever.
[3449.56 → 3452.28] There was no upgrade.
[3452.38 → 3452.82] Path.
[3453.30 → 3454.20] At all.
[3455.14 → 3455.58] Yeah.
[3456.18 → 3456.38] Yeah.
[3456.48 → 3459.58] Whereas now, there is legitimately...
[3459.58 → 3466.14] Okay, when all of my baller friends get tired of their Vega 64s and buy something more efficient, probably.
[3466.70 → 3469.78] And their, you know, Core i's.
[3469.84 → 3472.92] Because word on the street is like overclocked.
[3472.92 → 3474.94] You could be looking at hundreds.
[3476.00 → 3476.92] Not a couple.
[3477.74 → 3481.90] Hundreds of watts through an 18-core Core i9 through the socket.
[3482.38 → 3482.50] Okay?
[3483.30 → 3490.92] So, you know, I could buy this stuff for pennies on the dollar and have legitimately a baller-ass gaming machine.
[3491.62 → 3493.68] But I need a baller power supply for it.
[3493.68 → 3497.82] So, like, Scrapyard Wars 2026 is going to be banging.
[3498.14 → 3498.46] Yeah.
[3498.66 → 3499.20] Pretty much.
[3499.20 → 3506.82] And, like, the one thing that we're going to make sure that we invest in this time is a good power supply.
[3507.04 → 3507.44] Yeah.
[3509.72 → 3511.30] Like, a perfect one.
[3511.76 → 3512.00] Yeah.
[3512.30 → 3512.48] Yeah.
[3512.48 → 3515.90] What else we got here?
[3518.54 → 3522.02] Paris is apparently considering esports for the 2024 Olympics.
[3522.02 → 3527.06] Which, like, I've defended esports on the WAN show against you for years.
[3527.24 → 3528.70] And I think this is so dumb.
[3529.24 → 3530.16] Yeah, I'm kind of dumb with that.
[3530.16 → 3533.28] I would be down with there being, like, an esports Olympics.
[3533.70 → 3533.90] Sure.
[3534.50 → 3539.98] But that should be, like, it should be, like, okay, and don't take this the wrong way.
[3540.22 → 3540.48] Careful now.
[3540.48 → 3545.98] But it should go Olympics, Paralympics, and then E-Olympics.
[3546.86 → 3548.78] Because, quite frankly...
[3548.78 → 3551.30] Even if you just see it as, like, first one into the gate.
[3551.34 → 3555.32] The audience overlap is, like, negligible.
[3555.54 → 3555.94] Yeah.
[3556.24 → 3556.66] Probably.
[3557.18 → 3558.82] You could run them at the same time.
[3559.94 → 3562.54] No, because then I think that's, like...
[3562.54 → 3566.22] Okay, think about, like, you know, households with one screen, you know?
[3566.28 → 3566.64] Okay.
[3566.82 → 3566.98] Fair.
[3566.98 → 3567.78] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3567.84 → 3571.78] Junior doesn't want to fight with Grandpa over, you know, who's got the TV.
[3572.04 → 3572.20] Yeah.
[3572.94 → 3575.40] But, you know, what do we get here?
[3575.40 → 3578.58] They'll consider inclusion as a medal event, according to...
[3578.58 → 3578.90] Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[3578.92 → 3580.00] You've got to read this quote.
[3580.34 → 3580.90] You have to.
[3581.08 → 3581.54] Right there.
[3581.58 → 3584.38] We have to look at it, because we can't say, it's not us.
[3584.46 → 3585.58] It's not about Olympics.
[3585.72 → 3586.24] And the next one.
[3586.24 → 3587.08] The youth, yes.
[3587.14 → 3589.10] They're interested in esports and this kind of thing.
[3589.22 → 3589.80] Let's look at it.
[3589.86 → 3590.40] Let's meet them.
[3590.48 → 3592.28] Let's try and see if we can find some bridges.
[3592.56 → 3593.32] The youths.
[3593.66 → 3595.52] They like the electronics.
[3598.16 → 3601.84] We need to find a way to incorporate it so that the youths are interested.
[3605.26 → 3606.36] Oh, my goodness.
[3606.50 → 3606.92] All right.
[3607.98 → 3610.22] This was posted by the Beast PC on the forum.
[3610.22 → 3612.14] The original article is from Tom's Guide.
[3613.28 → 3615.44] This is apparently what the iPhone 8 looks like.
[3616.24 → 3618.88] It's an iPhone 8 dummy unit.
[3619.30 → 3620.06] And it's a video.
[3620.86 → 3621.34] Dagnabbit.
[3622.50 → 3623.72] Looks like a Marques video.
[3623.78 → 3624.76] Looks like a Marques video.
[3624.98 → 3630.68] I like that carpet right there that still doesn't have his thing that I told him to put on it when I inspected his studio.
[3630.68 → 3631.68] Okay.
[3633.90 → 3634.96] Well, we'll see how that goes.
[3635.96 → 3636.54] I, wow.
[3636.66 → 3638.78] I can't actually believe how much I hate this.
[3639.22 → 3639.54] Really?
[3639.66 → 3640.32] I don't mind it.
[3640.40 → 3641.12] Oh, I think it's...
[3641.12 → 3643.00] Because the screen extends on each side of it.
[3643.12 → 3643.66] It's a terabyte.
[3643.66 → 3646.22] I think it's just a way to get more screen real estate.
[3646.42 → 3648.10] Because you have, like, little notification things up there.
[3648.30 → 3650.46] Like, your battery status and stuff is in line with your camera.
[3653.34 → 3654.60] I don't mind it at all, personally.
[3656.68 → 3657.12] That...
[3657.12 → 3659.40] I really hope that's not the touch sensor on the back.
[3660.12 → 3661.28] That is pure cancer.
[3661.46 → 3662.22] Right in the middle?
[3663.12 → 3664.14] Is mine right in the...
[3664.14 → 3665.00] I don't have the phone on me.
[3665.12 → 3665.36] Is it?
[3665.44 → 3665.86] I think so.
[3666.04 → 3667.32] I thought it was up a little bit.
[3667.38 → 3667.76] Uh, no.
[3667.84 → 3668.74] You might be right, actually.
[3668.86 → 3670.54] That might be closer to the LG approach.
[3670.96 → 3671.38] Let me...
[3671.38 → 3671.82] I'm going to Google...
[3671.82 → 3672.90] I can't remember where LG puts it.
[3672.90 → 3673.32] Is that on my phone on me?
[3673.60 → 3673.90] Wow.
[3674.00 → 3677.12] I actually don't remember the last time I was that...
[3677.82 → 3679.12] not caring about a...
[3680.24 → 3680.58] iPhone.
[3680.70 → 3680.94] Apparently it'll have...
[3680.94 → 3682.48] It's not in the middle at all.
[3682.78 → 3683.12] Oh, yeah.
[3683.18 → 3683.34] Okay.
[3683.38 → 3683.66] I'm sorry.
[3683.66 → 3684.52] It's way up the top.
[3684.52 → 3686.48] Apparently it'll have wireless, uh, charging.
[3687.02 → 3688.64] It'll still have a camera bump on the back.
[3689.60 → 3690.20] And...
[3690.20 → 3691.46] This is ridiculous.
[3691.68 → 3691.88] Okay.
[3692.48 → 3694.34] This is posted by Snorting Frogs on the forum.
[3694.92 → 3700.00] We have been hounding Seagate to let us play with their 60TB SSD since they announced it,
[3700.10 → 3700.94] like, a year ago.
[3701.60 → 3706.16] They still haven't gotten one to us, and now they announce a 64TB NVMe SSD?
[3707.44 → 3709.06] Gosh darn it, you guys!
[3709.78 → 3710.44] No, I'm...
[3710.44 → 3711.82] I'm real upset now!
[3713.66 → 3715.58] I'll just ask for this one instead.
[3716.10 → 3716.60] There you go.
[3716.98 → 3717.38] Disney!
[3717.60 → 3719.10] To pull their content from Netflix.
[3719.26 → 3720.50] This is originally from Bloomberg.
[3720.68 → 3721.64] This is a big deal, actually.
[3721.82 → 3722.00] Yeah.
[3722.44 → 3726.94] So, the happy ecosystem that...
[3726.94 → 3732.58] Where you just pay one flat fee, and you get pretty much all the content that you could
[3732.58 → 3735.72] want, is getting fragmented.
[3735.72 → 3742.84] So much for the idea of pulling the plug, or cutting the cord, or whatever it's called.
[3743.04 → 3744.24] There's a Tide commercial.
[3744.72 → 3749.04] So much for cutting the cord, and being able to get pretty much everything you want for,
[3749.16 → 3751.22] like, 15 bucks a month in 4K.
[3751.22 → 3752.66] It is...
[3752.66 → 3753.22] It is...
[3753.22 → 3757.32] You're going to have to start building your own cable package the way you used to, subscribing
[3757.32 → 3758.64] to a bunch of different services.
[3759.06 → 3768.56] And there is a huge gap that just got formed in the market for someone who's the aggregator.
[3769.38 → 3770.82] Who's like, okay...
[3770.82 → 3772.68] Basically, a cable network.
[3772.96 → 3773.14] Yep.
[3773.22 → 3781.00] The online cable network is coming, where they're just like a platform where you buy your Disney,
[3781.26 → 3782.94] and your Netflix, and your other packages.
[3782.94 → 3784.30] And you view it all in one space.
[3784.30 → 3787.58] And it uses all the APIs to bring together a nice little thing.
[3787.70 → 3788.48] I wonder if that's going to be Plex.
[3788.54 → 3791.52] I think the TV makers are going to jump on this.
[3791.70 → 3791.88] Oh.
[3792.86 → 3794.66] So you think there's going to be, like, a Samsung?
[3794.92 → 3796.80] I think Google could jump on this.
[3796.96 → 3797.08] Yeah.
[3797.08 → 3799.60] I think Samsung is going to try and do their own thing with Wizen.
[3800.20 → 3801.86] I feel like Google might fail.
[3802.24 → 3802.52] I think...
[3802.52 → 3805.18] Because I think Google's going to try to do it through YouTube, and people aren't going
[3805.18 → 3805.60] to want that.
[3805.62 → 3806.42] I don't think they will.
[3806.48 → 3809.84] I think they're going to do it through devices like the NVIDIA Shield TV.
[3810.62 → 3817.46] Because remember, too, that there are TV manufacturers, including Sony, that bake full Android experiences
[3817.46 → 3818.36] into their TVs.
[3818.36 → 3818.64] Yeah, yeah.
[3818.66 → 3820.26] But there's people that want this on their laptop.
[3820.26 → 3826.80] The trend of, like, university girl watching Netflix all the time on her MacBook is, like,
[3826.80 → 3829.24] that's on her MacBook, not on her TV.
[3829.38 → 3831.02] It would be interesting for Plex to go after it.
[3831.06 → 3832.64] I don't think Plex would have the...
[3832.64 → 3833.92] I don't think Plex would have a...
[3833.92 → 3836.06] I don't think they'd have a seat at the negotiation table.
[3836.08 → 3836.72] Come on, Plex.
[3836.90 → 3837.58] For their...
[3837.58 → 3837.64] Step up.
[3837.64 → 3840.08] But for their support of piracy all these years.
[3840.66 → 3846.14] They're like, ooh, we don't support piracy, but support of piracy for all these years.
[3846.18 → 3848.18] I don't think they win a chance to talk about this.
[3848.42 → 3848.80] Interesting.
[3848.80 → 3854.70] So, I'll be interested to see where this goes, but one way or another, Disney pulled their
[3854.70 → 3855.76] catalogue from Netflix.
[3856.34 → 3860.88] They will stop supplying Disney and Pixar branded movies starting in 2019 and launch an online
[3860.88 → 3864.32] product of their own going directly to consumers.
[3864.64 → 3869.60] This is part of the reason why Linus started it, and I've been doing it for a little while
[3869.60 → 3869.86] now.
[3870.24 → 3875.84] I've been, like, collecting, when they go on crazy sales on Amazon, Blu-ray copies of movies
[3875.84 → 3879.56] and TV shows that I'm personally really interested in, because, like...
[3879.56 → 3879.74] Yep.
[3880.60 → 3883.38] Oh, yay, it's on Netflix, and then it might just disappear.
[3883.64 → 3883.90] Gone.
[3884.00 → 3884.52] Who knows?
[3884.56 → 3887.14] And, like, to be clear, I'm still going to have a Netflix subscription.
[3887.46 → 3888.40] And I do, as well.
[3888.44 → 3891.22] But the Blu-ray does look a lot better if you're a big snob.
[3891.44 → 3895.58] And if you're, like, a crazy fanatic of a certain show or movie...
[3896.00 → 3896.78] There's extras.
[3897.00 → 3897.86] And some of them are really cool.
[3898.02 → 3899.06] I really like commentary.
[3899.56 → 3899.74] Yep.
[3899.86 → 3900.76] That's one of my things.
[3900.76 → 3904.52] I've always really liked, like, one of my favourite things ever was the making of DVD,
[3904.52 → 3906.78] for, I think it's Halo 2 or Halo 3, I don't remember which one.
[3907.02 → 3907.74] That was amazing.
[3908.06 → 3910.42] I love making of things, and I love commentaries.
[3910.74 → 3913.10] I really like interviews with producers, actually.
[3913.20 → 3913.38] Yeah.
[3913.70 → 3914.86] Like, honestly...
[3914.86 → 3916.40] That's, like, the making of usually has...
[3916.40 → 3922.48] The interviews with Larry David on the Seinfeld complete collection that I got at Costco.
[3922.64 → 3923.44] It was, like, so cheap.
[3923.48 → 3923.94] It was awesome.
[3924.02 → 3924.44] That's the thing.
[3924.52 → 3925.66] You snipe them on sales.
[3925.80 → 3927.96] Don't buy them at full price, because they're really expensive.
[3927.96 → 3933.20] Like, HMV shut down, and I got, like, six seasons of Game of Thrones, which I'm still
[3933.20 → 3935.84] not watching, but, like, I know I'm going to watch them.
[3935.92 → 3937.76] I got, like, a bunch of seasons of Walking Dead.
[3937.88 → 3938.24] Six seasons?
[3938.36 → 3941.38] No, I got, I think, four seasons of Game of Thrones, like, six of Walking Dead, which
[3941.38 → 3942.14] I still want to watch.
[3942.18 → 3944.02] I haven't even started it yet, but...
[3944.02 → 3945.96] Yeah, so...
[3945.96 → 3950.10] Apparently they'll continue the relationship with Marvel TV.
[3951.20 → 3955.56] I got Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure and Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey in a combo
[3955.56 → 3959.14] pack for, like, $5 or something, which was awesome.
[3959.14 → 3960.34] Oh!
[3960.50 → 3960.78] Oh!
[3960.92 → 3961.24] Oh!
[3961.44 → 3961.72] Oh!
[3962.16 → 3968.06] Okay, now this might be a case of picking studies based on confirming your own bias, but
[3968.06 → 3970.42] this is off TechCrunch.
[3970.80 → 3974.86] Apparently, some study finds, and I haven't looked at their methodology at all, but this
[3974.86 → 3979.44] is just funny to me, because honestly, I think fitness trackers are the stupidest, most useless
[3979.44 → 3980.18] fad of all time.
[3980.20 → 3981.08] We're very against them.
[3982.02 → 3988.02] And I think we're both very for, like, physical health and exercise and taking care of yourself.
[3988.02 → 3991.98] I'm about that if you have to, like, track your steps, you're really not doing it right.
[3992.20 → 3992.32] Yeah.
[3993.32 → 3996.52] So Fitbit apparently turns teens off exercising.
[3998.00 → 3998.36] Was!
[3998.52 → 3998.70] Was!
[3999.74 → 4006.18] A lot of it has to do with pressure from competition with peers, encouraged in app leaderboard,
[4006.28 → 4010.78] and also all the other things that are, like, push, push, push, compete against this other
[4010.78 → 4015.20] person, only work for short-term style motivational effects.
[4015.20 → 4020.42] Or, and this is the other thing, I believe that fitness trackers are great for people
[4020.42 → 4024.62] who were already going to be ripped as hell and exercising all the time anyway.
[4025.70 → 4031.56] Like, it's one of those things where I don't see the fitness tracker as a solution.
[4031.80 → 4033.16] If you're only going for steps.
[4033.34 → 4033.62] Yes.
[4033.74 → 4034.34] That's another thing.
[4034.54 → 4041.26] They mention here, the completely non-personalized 10,000 steps per day target was cited as unfair
[4041.26 → 4045.58] and pressurizing goal, generating feelings of guilt or lack of ability among users.
[4045.58 → 4050.74] Like, if you're working on it, but it's really difficult, like, very difficult for you to
[4050.74 → 4054.22] get 10,000 steps a day, and you just feel like you're failing all the time because you
[4054.22 → 4057.10] can, like, 9,000 steps, but you're, like, really trying.
[4057.22 → 4057.96] I don't know what I meant today.
[4057.96 → 4058.68] That's terrible.
[4059.42 → 4061.02] I don't even know how to check it on here.
[4062.08 → 4062.60] Because...
[4062.60 → 4063.28] No.
[4064.54 → 4065.24] Oh, crap.
[4065.34 → 4067.62] I legitimately actually don't know how to check on here.
[4067.62 → 4072.98] I never use the Apple Watch, so it's, like...
[4072.98 → 4075.38] I should just switch to a watch.
[4076.26 → 4076.62] Honestly.
[4077.26 → 4077.48] Yeah.
[4078.40 → 4079.64] I've said that for a while.
[4080.98 → 4083.16] To start sharing your activity, sync to the iPhone.
[4083.44 → 4085.22] Yeah, I don't even have it sync to my phone right now.
[4086.90 → 4090.16] Gamers Nexus tests the Noctua fan rumours.
[4090.64 → 4093.12] So we'll post the original article here in the Twitch chat.
[4093.14 → 4093.50] I did already.
[4094.02 → 4094.42] Oh.
[4095.32 → 4095.82] Already, then?
[4095.84 → 4097.06] I knew you were going to go into this next.
[4097.06 → 4101.36] They tested differences, including appearance, noise, and effectiveness.
[4102.14 → 4106.40] And the online community was quick to crap on Noctua about this.
[4106.68 → 4111.12] But it turns out the differences in the tooling were mostly to do with just not...
[4111.12 → 4114.88] Just having two separate sets of moulds at two different locations and two separate facilities
[4114.88 → 4116.02] that have different capabilities.
[4116.74 → 4120.20] And tuning that took place between creating an original mould and a later mould.
[4121.54 → 4124.52] And their quality standards haven't changed at all.
[4124.52 → 4129.26] I was informed by Noctua that our LTT Edition fans were actually produced in China.
[4129.44 → 4129.88] All of them.
[4130.26 → 4131.90] And the NF-A14 has been...
[4131.90 → 4132.46] And they were great.
[4132.58 → 4133.18] Yeah, they were great.
[4133.30 → 4135.64] The NF-A14, I believe, has been over there for a long time.
[4135.64 → 4143.44] But basically, Gamers Nexus got a larger sample and debunked the claims.
[4143.64 → 4147.70] It was down to unit-to-unit variability for the original posts.
[4148.16 → 4152.24] And basically, it's all within margin of error.
[4152.38 → 4156.22] There's no difference between China and Taiwan-made fans except for the appearance.
[4156.22 → 4160.22] And Noctua has always had issues with their colour matching.
[4160.72 → 4163.76] We've got old Noctua fans where the cream is closer to white.
[4164.32 → 4166.90] And the brown is closer to like a reddish brown.
[4167.52 → 4169.10] Or closer to like a pure brown.
[4169.20 → 4170.46] Those I particularly don't like.
[4170.56 → 4170.70] Yeah.
[4170.76 → 4171.42] In terms of colour.
[4171.52 → 4172.82] The newer ones are not that big of a deal.
[4172.92 → 4173.54] So there you go.
[4174.36 → 4175.78] So that's pretty much it for the WAN show.
[4176.14 → 4176.30] Yeah.
[4176.30 → 4178.74] Do you have anything else to add?
[4179.00 → 4179.82] I don't believe...
[4179.82 → 4181.42] I can't talk about what I did this week.
[4181.54 → 4182.92] So I don't really believe so.
[4183.00 → 4183.80] Alright, it's been a long week.
[4183.86 → 4185.02] So I want to get the heck out of here.
[4185.18 → 4187.96] I actually have a bunch of stuff I have to cart up to the second story over there.
[4188.16 → 4188.98] After this anyway.
[4189.74 → 4190.02] Okay.
[4190.26 → 4191.48] Alright, we'll see you again next week.
[4191.56 → 4193.42] Same bat time, same bat channel.
[4193.64 → 4193.92] Bye.
[4195.84 → 4196.86] Wow, lots of viewers today.
[4197.22 → 4197.74] 6,800?
[4198.02 → 4198.68] Almost 6,900?
[4199.38 → 4200.54] Yeah, 6,900.
[4202.16 → 4203.00] That's pretty sick.
[4204.02 → 4204.98] That's pretty sick.
[4205.76 → 4206.24] D9.
[4206.30 → 4206.76] 100.
[4208.04 → 4208.44] Yeah.
[4209.08 → 4211.46] Alright, so I guess keep these organized.
[4215.64 → 4216.72] Oh, right.
[4217.02 → 4221.18] I also noticed the kids ones for these comes with a bunch of replacement ones.
[4221.32 → 4223.44] So that even if you break the side off, you can just replace it.
[4223.64 → 4224.14] That's sick.
[4224.34 → 4225.16] That's actually pretty smart.
[4225.26 → 4226.26] They know what's up with kids.
[4226.62 → 4226.80] Yeah.
[4228.84 → 4230.64] Someone on their team has had a child.
[4230.64 → 4231.56] Yeah.
[4231.56 → 4232.62] Should I stop writing.
[4232.62 → 4236.60] Even if I need their parents would not be Haitian.
[4236.76 → 4237.34] Yeah.
[4237.48 → 4237.52] I know.
[4241.60 → 4241.88] Yeah.
[4242.56 → 4243.74] What are you doing?
