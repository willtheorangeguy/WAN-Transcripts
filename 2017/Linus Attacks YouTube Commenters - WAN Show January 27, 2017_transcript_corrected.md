[0.00 → 2.00] We are live!
[2.00 → 7.00] Alright my friends, welcome to the WAN show.
[7.00 → 13.00] Some of you are friends that I only know through the occasional little snippets of insight
[13.00 → 21.00] I get into you and your lives through the Twitch chat, and some of you are my friends who I have met once in person.
[21.00 → 24.00] And I guess we DMed on Twitter a little bit.
[24.00 → 29.00] So welcome to the show. This is Wendell from Level 1 Techs.
[29.00 → 31.00] He is going to be co-hosting the show with me today.
[31.00 → 34.00] Luke is attending a Nintendo event.
[34.00 → 42.00] And I think I'll leave it to him to introduce himself and talk a little bit about who he is before we get started.
[42.00 → 46.00] Howdy! I'm Wendell. I'm just another nerd. It's fine.
[46.00 → 48.00] You can check us out at level1.tech, but...
[48.00 → 53.00] I don't really know what to tell you. My background is computer science. I like needing out.
[53.00 → 57.00] I've got some Earl Grey tea, and we're going to talk about the news.
[57.00 → 60.00] It's going to be awesome. And I don't know why that...
[60.00 → 62.00] Oh, right. I don't have this computer. There we go.
[62.00 → 64.00] Alright. There we go. There we go.
[64.00 → 69.00] Alright, so I just posted a link to his YouTube channel in the Twitch chat there.
[69.00 → 73.00] So you guys are going to want to go check that out. We're going to have that linked under the YouTube archive as well.
[73.00 → 79.00] So in the meantime, I'm going to roll the intro, which I spent most of the time prior to the show being late today,
[79.00 → 83.00] putting our entire audio setup back together because...
[83.00 → 86.00] And this was a very ill-advised move on my part.
[86.00 → 92.00] I took it all off and unplugged it all about half an hour before the show was supposed to start
[92.00 → 97.00] because I was actually making a video about... Wendell, you would love this thing.
[97.00 → 101.00] Actually, you know what? Here, hold on a second. Let me see if I have my...
[101.00 → 106.00] Oh, I do have it. Can I just throw this up here? Yeah, sick. Okay.
[106.00 → 112.00] So I'm just going to full screen this. All the USB cameras, check this thing out.
[112.00 → 124.00] That is a server cabinet. Wait, he can't see it. No, Wendell can't see it. He's on a different computer.
[124.00 → 128.00] Is it a four-post server rack that is amazing and magical?
[128.00 → 132.00] Hold on. Well, okay, they can see it. If you were watching the Twitch stream, then you'd be able to see it.
[132.00 → 134.00] Can you see it now?
[134.00 → 139.00] Is it the... Oh, that's the one that looks like a... Yeah, that's from Itaúsa.
[139.00 → 140.00] That's right.
[140.00 → 145.00] Yeah, that's a... You know, there's a law firm. I'm aware of a law firm that bought one of those
[145.00 → 149.00] because of an unfortunate placement of a 24-port switch in their...
[149.00 → 155.00] Like where their... The line came in for like their fibre or whatever in one of the lawyer's offices.
[155.00 → 159.00] And he's like, this is uncalled-for. And that totally is like a good solution for that.
[159.00 → 166.00] Yep. I think it's a great solution if you're looking to increase the sort of wife factor appeal of something like a...
[166.00 → 168.00] You know, a bunch of audio recording gear.
[168.00 → 175.00] So basically, I was trying to find every rack-mount cool-looking thing with lots of dials and switches on it and throw it in there.
[175.00 → 183.00] And I took pictures of where all the cables went because I have no idea how to set up our compressor, our preamp, our headphone amp for monitoring, and our mixer.
[183.00 → 186.00] I had no idea. Focus rite flew here to set it up for me.
[186.00 → 198.00] And so I... But I forgot. Even taking a picture wasn't enough for me because I forgot that I had taken a picture of the front where there was also some very important stuff.
[198.00 → 203.00] So I put all the back stuff back to go, look, why isn't the monitor working?
[203.00 → 208.00] Anyway, let's roll the intro, which doesn't work.
[208.00 → 212.00] And that... Sorry, there's a bit of a delay on the line there. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
[212.00 → 217.00] I was going to say, it doesn't matter. You've got 465 people, so it's fine.
[217.00 → 220.00] Yeah, alright. We'll be right back. We'll be right back.
[220.00 → 221.00] Intro time.
[221.00 → 227.00] Do, do, do, do, do, do. Yes, I haven't fixed this file yet. It has no audio.
[227.00 → 233.00] Do, do, do, do, do, do. That has a picture of Luke, but Luke's not on the show today because it's when the...
[233.00 → 236.00] Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
[236.00 → 238.00] Do, do, do, do, do. Okay, yep.
[238.00 → 248.00] I pause the thing. Okay. Yep. Linus Tech Tips. And they have sponsors because otherwise they would not be able to pay their bills, which is cool, I guess.
[248.00 → 251.00] Okay. And we're back.
[251.00 → 258.00] So, I've got a few people asking me to turn Wendell up a little bit. I'm going to turn you up a little bit, see if that makes them happy.
[258.00 → 262.00] Although a lot of people are saying it's perfect, 10 out of 10. So I'm going to go with that.
[262.00 → 266.00] And it's selective, taking selective feedback. This is the new way, is it not?
[266.00 → 270.00] Taking the things you want to hear and focusing on those.
[270.00 → 275.00] How is it down in America? Actually, we don't get political on the show anymore, so you don't have to answer that.
[275.00 → 277.00] Yes.
[277.00 → 278.00] Yes.
[278.00 → 279.00] Yes.
[279.00 → 281.00] 27.
[281.00 → 286.00] I'm glad you asked.
[286.00 → 289.00] I'm just going to drink some more of this tea.
[289.00 → 293.00] That's code for, I don't know what's going on, help me.
[293.00 → 298.00] Fortunately, this tea isn't for Mexico, or I'd be paying 20% more for it now.
[298.00 → 302.00] So much for NAFTA, I mean.
[302.00 → 306.00] Yep.
[306.00 → 318.00] Okay, why don't we talk about something that is a far less political and less controversial subject that was, you know, a source of less strife for you in the last little bit.
[318.00 → 322.00] You got to explain, why are you level one tech's now?
[322.00 → 323.00] Well...
[323.00 → 325.00] See, there's much less drama, right?
[325.00 → 327.00] Yeah, we kind of started over.
[327.00 → 328.00] You know, I wasn't really sure.
[328.00 → 330.00] It was a lot of fun.
[330.00 → 336.00] I kind of like doing this, you know, so I've been a consultant for, you know, the better part of a decade.
[336.00 → 343.00] And I do programming and this sort of thing was fun to show off stuff.
[343.00 → 345.00] But we have this really amazing community.
[345.00 → 357.00] And so I didn't really want to abandon the community as it were, because there's a lot of people in the community that are like IT pros or their students that are like coming up, and they're like, I don't know if I want to study computer science or if I want to get into networking.
[357.00 → 358.00] Or I want to do whatever.
[358.00 → 368.00] And it's like, well, you know, maybe we could take a sort of different tack on this and do some, you know, admittedly niche content, niche stuff.
[368.00 → 370.00] The Linux content was really popular.
[370.00 → 372.00] I get to meet some really amazing guys.
[372.00 → 376.00] I get to meet Eric, Raymond, and Strongly.
[376.00 → 377.00] You know Strongly.
[377.00 → 378.00] You've seen Strongly, right?
[378.00 → 381.00] I actually am not familiar with Strongly.
[381.00 → 382.00] Yeah, he's a meme.
[382.00 → 383.00] I'm sorry.
[383.00 → 384.00] If you Google Strongly.
[384.00 → 386.00] Oh, just, oh, the meme.
[386.00 → 387.00] Okay, yes.
[387.00 → 388.00] Yeah, yeah.
[388.00 → 394.00] So it turns out that guy is an insanely brilliant mainframe expert.
[394.00 → 402.00] And so I've met him and actually got to talk to him about System 390, and he works in the Hercules emulator.
[402.00 → 406.00] And he's just a fascinating, brilliant guy.
[406.00 → 410.00] And so it's just, level one is about that kind of stuff.
[410.00 → 419.00] It's about this kind of projects because you never know, you know, who the celebrity meme person is going to be that actually works on a, you know, like a mainframe emulator.
[419.00 → 422.00] Yeah, so Star Wars kid, he's a sound designer.
[422.00 → 423.00] Oh, I didn't know that.
[423.00 → 424.00] Oh, I didn't know that.
[424.00 → 425.00] No, no, no, no.
[425.00 → 429.00] I have no, no, I think he ended up getting bullied and dropping out of school or something like that.
[429.00 → 431.00] I'm not sure exactly what happened.
[431.00 → 433.00] Oh, well, that kind of sucks, I guess.
[433.00 → 435.00] Yeah, no, that's actually not very funny.
[435.00 → 440.00] Yeah, the Linux pros have been good.
[440.00 → 443.00] Yep, okay.
[443.00 → 450.00] So are you going to touch on any of the I mean, I'm sure people would love to hear your side of the story.
[450.00 → 455.00] The entire chat is going like blah blah blah, tech syndicate this, tech syndicate that.
[455.00 → 457.00] Are you going to talk about it?
[457.00 → 459.00] No, I don't think so.
[459.00 → 460.00] All right.
[460.00 → 464.00] It's just, eh, it was fun while it lasted.
[464.00 → 468.00] This is a little bit different, and it is what it is.
[468.00 → 470.00] So, eh.
[470.00 → 472.00] Having fun so far?
[472.00 → 476.00] Yeah, so far it's actually been, I was actually kind of surprised by the community.
[476.00 → 481.00] The community was like, you should do this and, you know, don't go away and blah blah blah.
[481.00 → 483.00] And it was like, okay, well, I mean, I guess that's fine.
[483.00 → 486.00] And so that worked out really well.
[486.00 → 494.00] I was really surprised by, you know, the support from the community so far and just kind of trying this as an experiment and doing fun, interesting stuff.
[494.00 → 501.00] But, you know, I don't, this whole like YouTube e-celebrity, whatever, I don't really, like, honestly, I really don't fully get it.
[501.00 → 505.00] Like, I just, I don't really, I'm just needing out.
[505.00 → 508.00] And I guess the audience is along for the ride.
[508.00 → 519.00] So what, you don't, you don't, you don't get, you know, why someone might think that, like, Jenna Marbles is the most amazing person on Earth?
[519.00 → 525.00] I just, I feel, every time I make a video, there's that little voice in the back of my head that is like, you self-important blowhard.
[525.00 → 526.00] Why are you doing this?
[526.00 → 528.00] This doesn't make any sense at all.
[528.00 → 537.00] And it's just like, well, I get, I mean, it's like I'm spreading the gospel of open source and, and, and Linux and, and, you know, knowledge is power and all that kind of stuff.
[537.00 → 538.00] So I guess it's all right.
[538.00 → 551.00] Yeah, you guys, I mean, just from like a purely sort of, you know, self-important blowhard sort of, you know, really focused on being an e-celebrity sort of perspective, you guys are doing really well.
[551.00 → 564.00] I mean, for such a new channel, 130,000 subscribers, but more importantly than that, the last four videos are averaging about 30,000 views, give or take each, or the last five or so.
[564.00 → 569.00] Which means that a quarter of your audience is watching.
[569.00 → 570.00] Is interested.
[570.00 → 572.00] Yeah, everything you put up.
[572.00 → 581.00] I mean, for me, people can look at it, and they'll go, oh yeah, he's got like 3.6 million subscribers, but we're averaging like 500, 600,000 views per video.
[581.00 → 589.00] So that means that like one seventh, and I'm not that great at mental math, so hopefully that's pretty close, but closer to a sixth or a seventh.
[589.00 → 591.00] So those are like really, really impressive numbers.
[591.00 → 599.00] It's really kind of weird though, because like some of the content is really, really esoteric.
[599.00 → 606.00] Like we did like the SMB multichannel video, and I can't imagine that anybody would have just a casual interest in that.
[606.00 → 614.00] But if you're a system administrator or somebody that's like been through that, banging your head against a wall, there's information in there that you just, you can't get anywhere else.
[614.00 → 620.00] Because nobody has bothered to write it up and plus Microsoft's changed it like 12 different times.
[620.00 → 625.00] So, you know, but there's a it's really dense technical information.
[625.00 → 626.00] So I guess that's good.
[626.00 → 628.00] And the Linux videos are kind of like that.
[628.00 → 633.00] But the storage server video, there's not really a lot of technical content in that.
[633.00 → 637.00] The first version of that was like an hour long, and it had a lot of technical information.
[637.00 → 640.00] But we sort of did a funny skit in it.
[640.00 → 648.00] I don't know if you saw it or not, but you, there was a little picture of you and on a picture and there was on the wall and some other, you know, tech YouTubers in yarn.
[648.00 → 649.00] It was kind of funny.
[649.00 → 650.00] Oh, I'll have to watch it.
[650.00 → 652.00] But it was when we were building our storage server.
[652.00 → 658.00] And so it's a it's a it's based on a Fedora, which is a distribution of Linux, and it's using ZFS.
[658.00 → 663.00] And so there's about a hundred hard drives and four rack mount chassis and an old Google server.
[663.00 → 665.00] And so it's 172 terabytes.
[665.00 → 669.00] And I had a blast not only building that, but also sort of documenting it on video.
[669.00 → 670.00] At one point I rode the rack.
[670.00 → 672.00] It's a it's on a wheeled rack.
[672.00 → 675.00] And so at one point I rode the rack, like a skateboard around the office.
[675.00 → 679.00] And there's a little, a little bit of that in the video, but doing that kind of like, I'm good.
[679.00 → 682.00] I'm doing that stuff anyway, whether it's on camera.
[682.00 → 685.00] And so now it's just like, Oh, I can do it on camera and people will watch that.
[685.00 → 687.00] And you know, there's ad dollars for that.
[687.00 → 688.00] Okay.
[688.00 → 689.00] Sounds good.
[689.00 → 691.00] I can just buy more random crap.
[691.00 → 696.00] So, I mean, the intention for you is never to turn this into your full-time gig.
[696.00 → 697.00] Is it?
[697.00 → 698.00] I don't think so.
[698.00 → 705.00] The, the, the interesting situation, I mean, maybe, but the situation is that a lot of the
[705.00 → 710.00] stuff that, that we would be doing videos on are things that I'm doing professionally or
[710.00 → 713.00] things that are connected to things that I'm doing professionally.
[713.00 → 717.00] And so like, we're working on a video right now on Docker, which is like a programming thing.
[717.00 → 724.00] And if I weren't doing that professionally, I don't know that I would know enough about it to do a video.
[724.00 → 726.00] That's like, this is how you get started with Docker.
[726.00 → 728.00] This is how you're productive with this.
[728.00 → 729.00] Right.
[729.00 → 730.00] Same thing with like ZFS and the server.
[730.00 → 735.00] It's like, if I wasn't doing it professionally, I don't know that I would sort of figure that out.
[735.00 → 738.00] I don't know that the content would be interesting.
[738.00 → 743.00] I'm just throwing up your, throwing up your video here on the, on the screen share.
[743.00 → 745.00] So people can see you sitting next to, what is that?
[745.00 → 746.00] A six U?
[746.00 → 750.00] It's two, it's four, four U cabinets and one two U server.
[750.00 → 751.00] Hold on.
[751.00 → 755.00] I, oh, you're probably not looking at the same frame of the video as me.
[755.00 → 756.00] Okay.
[756.00 → 757.00] So there you go.
[757.00 → 758.00] There's, this is a good view of it.
[758.00 → 760.00] So there's the there's the two, four Us right there, you guys.
[760.00 → 762.00] And then there's the two U right up there.
[762.00 → 767.00] Um, let's see if I can find your fun little skit part.
[767.00 → 770.00] Where do you, where do you ride the where do you ride the rack?
[770.00 → 772.00] Cause that sounds amazing.
[773.00 → 776.00] There's a GIF of it somewhere that the people have already made.
[776.00 → 780.00] So it's, it's probably, it's, there's, it's probably in the description or something.
[780.00 → 787.00] I don't know, but it's, uh, uh, yeah, it just ended up being kind of nuts, and it's not insanely
[787.00 → 788.00] fast.
[788.00 → 789.00] It's only got one 10, 10 gig interface right now.
[789.00 → 794.00] I've got to get a dual 10 gig adapter for it, but it can move a gigabyte per second.
[794.00 → 795.00] No problem.
[795.00 → 796.00] And it's all spinning rust.
[796.00 → 800.00] I do have one in VME in there for caching, but, but, uh, other than that, it's all spinning
[800.00 → 801.00] rust, which is not bad.
[801.00 → 807.00] So we are, we are finally, uh, Oh, I have, I have figured out how I'm doing the archival
[807.00 → 808.00] storage actually.
[808.00 → 812.00] So it looks like we're going to be using Cluster FS.
[812.00 → 813.00] Cool.
[813.00 → 814.00] That's awesome.
[814.00 → 815.00] That will be good.
[815.00 → 816.00] I think.
[816.00 → 819.00] So that's, um, right now we've got some, um,
[819.00 → 820.00] all the superfast stuff.
[820.00 → 825.00] So the pure NVMe storage server that's running Windows server, native SMB.
[825.00 → 827.00] There's a lot to be said for it.
[827.00 → 828.00] Um, is it perfect?
[828.00 → 836.00] No, but support for pure NVMe DIY solutions right now, as far as I can tell is sort of.
[836.00 → 837.00] Yeah.
[837.00 → 838.00] Not really exist.
[838.00 → 839.00] Not doesn't really exist.
[839.00 → 843.00] I mean, if you want to go to IBM or something, and you want to buy some hyper fast, you know,
[843.00 → 853.00] a hundred, you know, gigabyte, like, you know, super flash storage doodad that plunks into
[853.00 → 854.00] a proprietary system.
[854.00 → 855.00] Sure.
[855.00 → 856.00] Go for it.
[856.00 → 861.00] Um, yeah, you have to be careful with those because they'll happily take your $50,000, but it doesn't
[861.00 → 862.00] always live up to the hype.
[862.00 → 867.00] I mean, uh, it's just, you have to get one and play with it and don't be afraid to send it
[867.00 → 869.00] back even though it costs, you know, five, six figures.
[869.00 → 871.00] But that's the thing is on the very high end.
[871.00 → 873.00] There's that on the very low end.
[873.00 → 879.00] There's, you're not buying 48 NVMe drives because you're trying to do it more cheaply
[879.00 → 880.00] than that.
[880.00 → 884.00] So there's this, there's this in between that super micro built this server that I don't
[884.00 → 887.00] understand who the customer is for, but I ended up with one.
[887.00 → 892.00] And, uh, and so windows Windows server, it is, I guess for now anyway.
[892.00 → 897.00] So we've got that for high speed, and then we're moving to, uh, Cluster FS, uh, running
[897.00 → 899.00] on, I forget some Linux distro.
[899.00 → 903.00] Once again, I'm having people who understand it better than I do, uh, fly up here and set
[903.00 → 904.00] it up for me.
[904.00 → 908.00] So, uh, Brett from 45 drives is actually coming up to set us up.
[908.00 → 912.00] So we are actually aiming, and I'm not sure if we're going to get there yet.
[912.00 → 917.00] Cause that molar, but we are aiming to do a one petabyte storage machine, the petabyte
[917.00 → 918.00] project.
[918.00 → 919.00] Nice.
[919.00 → 920.00] Nice.
[920.00 → 923.00] So you just laid off a bunch of people though.
[923.00 → 926.00] So I don't know what that means for the hard drive industry spinning rust.
[926.00 → 927.00] Yeah.
[927.00 → 929.00] Well, they laid off a bunch of people.
[929.00 → 930.00] We talked about this in the WEN show last week, actually.
[930.00 → 934.00] So I don't think we can do it as a full topic, but they, uh, they laid off a bunch of
[934.00 → 938.00] people, and they closed down like significantly into double-digit percentage.
[938.00 → 941.00] And they, they, they, they, they, they had a bunch of people who were looking at the
[941.00 → 942.00] hard drive production capacity.
[942.00 → 945.00] At that time, had they announced the 14 and 16 terabyte drives?
[945.00 → 947.00] I had just noticed that the last few days.
[947.00 → 948.00] No, I don't think so.
[948.00 → 949.00] Yeah.
[949.00 → 953.00] They, they just announced a 14 and 16 terabyte capacity drives.
[953.00 → 959.00] Um, but I can't get any information out of them on the throughput of the drives because
[959.00 → 963.00] it seems like the capacity of the drives have been going up and up and up and up, but the
[963.00 → 966.00] throughput on the drives really hasn't improved all that much.
[966.00 → 971.00] And like our, I mean, you know, our storage array is basically a surplus.
[971.00 → 972.00] So it was retired.
[972.00 → 973.00] So it was retired.
[973.00 → 978.00] I got lucky though, because the power on hours on all the drives are only about 18 months
[978.00 → 980.00] and the you can like mechanical hard drives.
[980.00 → 983.00] You can set your watch by their design, at least enterprise grade.
[983.00 → 987.00] They're designed to last five years, anything beyond five years, you are on borrowed time.
[987.00 → 988.00] Right.
[988.00 → 991.00] And that, and that comes from a decade of experience.
[991.00 → 994.00] And, uh, the, the drives that we've got, they're only two terabytes.
[994.00 → 1001.00] There's like a hundred of them, but, uh, but the time to replicate them is really, really quick.
[1001.00 → 1005.00] Like those drives have a, have a streaming performance or just, you know, transfer rate
[1005.00 → 1010.00] of like 150 megabytes per second, 140, 150 at the fastest part of the disc.
[1010.00 → 1013.00] So re-imaging two terabytes, not a big deal.
[1013.00 → 1014.00] Yeah.
[1014.00 → 1017.00] 14 terabytes at say 200 megabytes per second.
[1017.00 → 1018.00] Yeah.
[1018.00 → 1019.00] Two to 10, maybe.
[1019.00 → 1020.00] Yeah.
[1020.00 → 1021.00] I mean, that's going to take like days.
[1021.00 → 1026.00] I mean, not to mention you look at what Western Digital is doing for their 12 and 14 terabyte
[1026.00 → 1027.00] discs.
[1027.00 → 1034.00] So their 12 is going to be a standard, um, perpendicular magnetic recording, but their 14
[1034.00 → 1036.00] terabyte is only going to be available in shingled.
[1036.00 → 1037.00] Yeah.
[1037.00 → 1039.00] The rewrites on that aren't going to be fun.
[1039.00 → 1043.00] I guess it's good for archives, but yeah.
[1043.00 → 1044.00] Yep.
[1044.00 → 1048.00] Which is about it, which is exactly what we plan to be using stuff like that for.
[1048.00 → 1053.00] But, um, yeah, it's going to be, uh, it's going to be a very interesting next, next few
[1053.00 → 1054.00] years.
[1054.00 → 1056.00] I mean, uh, look, uh, walking around in Seagate's booth at CES.
[1056.00 → 1058.00] I don't know if you were the were you down at CES or no?
[1058.00 → 1059.00] No, no.
[1059.00 → 1060.00] I skipped CES.
[1060.00 → 1064.00] I'm hoping to make it to Computer, but, uh, you know, it's only 125,000 subs.
[1064.00 → 1067.00] I've got to, I got to spend a couple of years growing my subscribers or whatever.
[1067.00 → 1070.00] Well, we'll try and throw a few your day, wait today.
[1070.00 → 1071.00] Thanks.
[1071.00 → 1072.00] Appreciate it.
[1072.00 → 1075.00] I've learned in the lingo, learning the vernacular as it were.
[1075.00 → 1076.00] Subs.
[1076.00 → 1077.00] Yeah.
[1077.00 → 1078.00] All right.
[1078.00 → 1083.00] So, um, next topic of the day.
[1083.00 → 1086.00] I don't know if you, I don't know if you looked at the video.
[1086.00 → 1089.00] I'm sure you didn't because you would have already known the answer to this.
[1089.00 → 1091.00] Um, we did a video yesterday.
[1091.00 → 1092.00] I think it was yesterday.
[1092.00 → 1093.00] Yeah.
[1093.00 → 1101.00] Yesterday called does a thousand dollar windows perform better where we took a server version
[1101.00 → 1107.00] of windows and basically, you know, ran your typical desktop benchmarks against good old
[1107.00 → 1110.00] fashioned Windows 10.
[1110.00 → 1114.00] And the comments on this video are just, just poisonous.
[1114.00 → 1119.00] Um, so, so this guy says, wow, the ignorance in this video is tremendous.
[1119.00 → 1123.00] No one is actually paying the server edition of windows for performance.
[1123.00 → 1125.00] They are paying that big buck for its features.
[1125.00 → 1126.00] Ugh.
[1126.00 → 1131.00] I really thought that Linus would research first before making these kinds of videos.
[1131.00 → 1137.00] So tell me something, Wendell, you've known me for about four years now, actually, I think
[1137.00 → 1138.00] you've known me for about four years.
[1138.00 → 1144.00] Do you think that I expected the server version of windows to perform dramatically different from
[1144.00 → 1145.00] the desktop one?
[1145.00 → 1147.00] Yeah, probably not.
[1147.00 → 1154.00] Do you think there is a case to be made for making a video because perhaps somebody else
[1154.00 → 1157.00] other than the host might not know this?
[1157.00 → 1160.00] Yeah, that, that could come out.
[1160.00 → 1161.00] I could see that, maybe.
[1161.00 → 1168.00] I could see that as it relates to the game mode, the upcoming game mode for windows, honestly,
[1168.00 → 1174.00] because if you look at like, um, the host processes and the default loadout on like which services
[1174.00 → 1176.00] are enabled and what server is doing and blah, blah, blah.
[1176.00 → 1177.00] Yeah.
[1177.00 → 1182.00] Especially, especially if you start with like core OS and you just enable the desktop experience
[1182.00 → 1183.00] and that's all you've got.
[1183.00 → 1187.00] Uh, depending on what you're doing, that can actually be faster.
[1187.00 → 1192.00] If you can do whatever you're doing without the desktop experience, then that would even
[1192.00 → 1193.00] be better.
[1193.00 → 1196.00] But for desktop workloads, you're probably going to need the desktop experience.
[1196.00 → 1197.00] You probably will.
[1197.00 → 1202.00] Um, and honestly, the, the most frustrating thing about this is that like the very beginning
[1202.00 → 1208.00] of the video, I even point out old forum threads from back in the Vista days of people asking,
[1208.00 → 1210.00] does Vista ultimate perform better?
[1210.00 → 1212.00] Oh, actually I think that was true.
[1212.00 → 1217.00] I think that not Vista ultimate, but I think that like server 08 actually did perform better
[1217.00 → 1220.00] than Vista because Vista was just a huge steaming pile of trash.
[1220.00 → 1223.00] I ran Vista for a long time.
[1223.00 → 1226.00] Maybe you just didn't have the horses.
[1226.00 → 1227.00] That's right.
[1227.00 → 1229.00] That might be true.
[1229.00 → 1230.00] I mean, it's possible.
[1230.00 → 1233.00] I mean, I wasn't trying to run Vista on a, on a netbook either though.
[1233.00 → 1235.00] So that, I mean, that was painful.
[1235.00 → 1237.00] You remember that when they were shipping netbooks with Vista?
[1237.00 → 1238.00] Yeah.
[1238.00 → 1239.00] Oh yeah.
[1239.00 → 1241.00] I tried to use one once.
[1241.00 → 1243.00] I was just like, this is ridiculous.
[1243.00 → 1246.00] Um, so let's talk a little bit about Windows 10 game mode.
[1246.00 → 1250.00] Because I've actually got like, I'm sure you have the same video in the, in the work.
[1250.00 → 1256.00] So it's going to be the race to who can make it first, but Windows 10 game mode versus those windows
[1256.00 → 1262.00] 10 D blow to five scripts that you can run versus stock Windows 10 out of the box.
[1262.00 → 1264.00] How interesting of a video is that going to be?
[1266.00 → 1271.00] You know, in the preliminary testing that we've done, there's not like the, the game mode, the, the build
[1271.00 → 1275.00] that we played with was the very first version that enabled the game mode.
[1275.00 → 1279.00] And honestly, I couldn't really tell that it did a lot other than it disabled search
[1279.00 → 1283.00] indexer while your, while the game was running, which, okay.
[1283.00 → 1286.00] And, uh, there was something else that it did.
[1286.00 → 1289.00] I did something with the DVR, the Xbox Live DVR.
[1289.00 → 1290.00] Sure.
[1290.00 → 1292.00] And, and that was, and it's like, okay, I mean, sure.
[1292.00 → 1296.00] The D blow script that we have mostly disables the telemetry and all that crap.
[1296.00 → 1297.00] Mm-hmm.
[1297.00 → 1300.00] But, um, do any of these things fix the start menu yet?
[1300.00 → 1305.00] No, you mean where the start menu just randomly doesn't respond sometimes?
[1305.00 → 1306.00] Yeah.
[1306.00 → 1307.00] Yeah.
[1307.00 → 1308.00] No.
[1308.00 → 1309.00] Isn't that baffling?
[1309.00 → 1310.00] Yeah, it really is.
[1310.00 → 1311.00] I'll give, I'll give you one better.
[1311.00 → 1316.00] Uh, Windows 10, the, the builds that we, that we use in the like for business stuff, uh,
[1316.00 → 1320.00] randomly after like three or four days, it's just stops being responsive.
[1320.00 → 1321.00] You have to restart the whole machine.
[1321.00 → 1323.00] Eventually, Explorer will crash for no apparent reason.
[1324.00 → 1325.00] Really?
[1325.00 → 1328.00] Did you try turning it off and turning it back on again?
[1328.00 → 1329.00] Did that fix it?
[1329.00 → 1330.00] That does fix it.
[1330.00 → 1331.00] Oh, good.
[1332.00 → 1335.00] Well, I mean, yeah, I'm talking to the level one tech's guy, right?
[1335.00 → 1337.00] So I have to, I have to throw these jokes in here.
[1340.00 → 1345.00] So in a nutshell, oh, for, uh, for those of you who aren't familiar with game mode,
[1345.00 → 1349.00] uh, we've got an article here from Ars Technica that we got all of our information from
[1349.00 → 1354.00] because we don't do any actual research, but the idea behind it is improved resource allocation
[1354.00 → 1355.00] gives a boost to frame rates.
[1355.00 → 1361.00] And in a nutshell, um, they're saying that when game mode is active, the OS will lean
[1361.00 → 1363.00] towards allocating CPU and GPU resources to the game.
[1363.00 → 1367.00] I don't know what else it would be allocating GPU resources to, but who knows?
[1367.00 → 1375.00] For games that are CPU or GPU bound, um, Kevin Tamil, partner group program manager for the Xbox platform,
[1375.00 → 1379.00] said that they were seeing frame rate improvements of two to 5%.
[1380.00 → 1384.00] I mean, uh, the thing about frame rate improvements from two to 5% is that it's one of those things
[1384.00 → 1390.00] where it sounds kind of good on paper, but in practice, a 2% frame rate improvement is what?
[1391.00 → 1392.00] At 60 FPS.
[1393.00 → 1394.00] Yeah, not enough.
[1394.00 → 1399.00] Is that the difference between like the hardware that you had now you're like really getting the most out of it?
[1399.00 → 1403.00] And, uh, a terrible gaming experience.
[1403.00 → 1407.00] I don't, based on the testing that we've done, I don't think we're going to do a video on this,
[1407.00 → 1412.00] but here's something that you could try for, for yours in task manager as a control,
[1412.00 → 1416.00] just right-click on the game process and set it to an elevated priority.
[1416.00 → 1420.00] Not real time, not high, just the, the one that's above normal.
[1421.00 → 1425.00] And, um, I bet that will result in a two to 5% performance increase.
[1426.00 → 1427.00] Hmm.
[1430.00 → 1431.00] Just elevating the process.
[1431.00 → 1438.00] I mean, there's a that was one of the fixes from rock star when GTA five first came out, um,
[1438.00 → 1440.00] for like middle of the road, I five systems.
[1440.00 → 1441.00] They're like, Oh, everything is fine.
[1441.00 → 1443.00] But sometimes it goes glitchy and weird.
[1443.00 → 1449.00] Literally the, the, the thing from rock star was, uh, right-click on the thing and set it to above normal.
[1449.00 → 1451.00] And people were like, Oh my God, that fixed it.
[1452.00 → 1457.00] So, and it might be that windows is doing, you know, like the search index or bullshit in the background or whatever.
[1458.00 → 1466.00] The malware services executable is the one that keeps killing my, like my, my, my razor blade will be sitting on a table, like 10 feet away from me.
[1466.00 → 1467.00] And it'll start going.
[1467.00 → 1468.00] And it'll start going.
[1468.00 → 1469.00] I go over there.
[1469.00 → 1470.00] I'm like, what do you mean?
[1470.00 → 1471.00] 18% CPU usage.
[1471.00 → 1472.00] There's nothing open.
[1472.00 → 1475.00] It's doing a background scan.
[1475.00 → 1476.00] Cause that's what you need, right?
[1476.00 → 1477.00] Yeah.
[1477.00 → 1479.00] I need that when I'm running on battery.
[1479.00 → 1480.00] Thank you.
[1480.00 → 1481.00] Thank you.
[1481.00 → 1491.00] Um, so anyway, game mode in case you do care about it, will work for both traditional win 32 games and new universal windows platform games.
[1491.00 → 1498.00] Um, the creators update will ship with a periodically updated white list of known games for automatically enabling game mode.
[1498.00 → 1500.00] So that's cool.
[1500.00 → 1501.00] I guess.
[1501.00 → 1503.00] White list for increasing the priority.
[1503.00 → 1507.00] Like I can do that with a PowerShell script done.
[1507.00 → 1512.00] Anyway, back to, back to making videos that we already know the answer to.
[1512.00 → 1517.00] I think probably, I think this is one of my biggest frustrations as a content creator,
[1517.00 → 1521.00] because we actually did one quite a while back.
[1521.00 → 1529.00] Um, does water cooling make your room cooler or something along those lines?
[1529.00 → 1530.00] I can't remember exactly what we called it.
[1530.00 → 1531.00] Yeah, there it is.
[1531.00 → 1534.00] Does water cooling make your room cooler?
[1534.00 → 1540.00] And the one that drove me the craziest on that one, at least with the windows versus Windows server video,
[1540.00 → 1546.00] people were like, Linus, you're an idiot because of, they got the right answer.
[1546.00 → 1550.00] They, they knew that like, there shouldn't be much of a difference.
[1550.00 → 1555.00] With this one, half the comments are, Linus, you're an idiot.
[1555.00 → 1557.00] You, why would you think this?
[1557.00 → 1560.00] And the other half of the comments are, Linus, you're an idiot.
[1560.00 → 1562.00] Of course it makes your room cooler.
[1562.00 → 1563.00] How did you not know that?
[1563.00 → 1569.00] I'm sitting here going, that is why I made the video.
[1569.00 → 1581.00] Now, I'm probably going to get some hate for saying this, but, uh, you know, you've got your computer and your computer's drawing, you know, 700 watts, 800 watts or whatever.
[1581.00 → 1582.00] Really?
[1582.00 → 1589.00] That is, that is functionally no different from having a space heater that is dumping 700 or 800 watts of heat into your room.
[1589.00 → 1592.00] It's like, oh, the computer, like, you, you really want to get pedantic.
[1592.00 → 1594.00] You can be like, oh, the computer is doing the work.
[1594.00 → 1599.00] And the amount of energy that's going into doing work is not going to generate heat.
[1599.00 → 1600.00] That is negligible.
[1600.00 → 1604.00] Yeah, that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard because it's pretty obvious, okay?
[1604.00 → 1609.00] Like when you have a heat sink on your CPU, okay, you touch the heat sink, it's very hot.
[1609.00 → 1613.00] And when you have a water cooling radiator, water is inherently cold.
[1613.00 → 1614.00] Water.
[1614.00 → 1616.00] You have to carry that somewhere else.
[1616.00 → 1618.00] Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1618.00 → 1620.00] The water is much cooler, much cooler.
[1620.00 → 1623.00] You touch the radiator, no, no.
[1623.00 → 1631.00] I mean, that, my friends, is why when you have a laptop that's running really hot, and you take it into a room,
[1631.00 → 1635.00] you can look right out the window and bam, temperature goes down.
[1635.00 → 1637.00] Global warming defeated.
[1637.00 → 1644.00] That's one of the things that, did you guys do a video on alternative fluids for liquid cooling?
[1644.00 → 1649.00] Because that has come up a lot on our forums, and it's just like, Jesus, the specific heat capacity of water is perfect.
[1649.00 → 1650.00] It's hard to beat it.
[1650.00 → 1651.00] No, I haven't.
[1651.00 → 1658.00] I mean, that's one of those things where we've shied away from some of the really, really nerdy enthusiast topics like that.
[1658.00 → 1661.00] It's something that I've been aware of for a long time.
[1661.00 → 1664.00] I don't know how long, how long have you been in the water cooling scene?
[1664.00 → 1667.00] You're more of a like, an enterprise tech guy.
[1667.00 → 1670.00] I've never done a custom loop water cooler, ever.
[1670.00 → 1671.00] Okay.
[1671.00 → 1677.00] So, I've been in the custom water cooler scene since about 2006 or so.
[1677.00 → 1682.00] And back then, the popular one was an additive called water wetter.
[1682.00 → 1684.00] That was an automotive additive.
[1684.00 → 1687.00] So, people were putting that in their water cooling loops.
[1687.00 → 1696.00] And I think people were getting quite confused in those days, especially because there was a lot of, a lot more even, a lot more misinformation.
[1696.00 → 1701.00] So, people were putting water wetter in on the advice of friends.
[1701.00 → 1707.00] And water wetter was supposed to be, was supposed to, it was advertised that it would help with cooling.
[1707.00 → 1712.00] But I think one of its more important characteristics was actually an anti-corrosive additive that was in it.
[1712.00 → 1713.00] Yeah.
[1713.00 → 1724.00] So, back then, mixing metals, brass, copper, aluminum, even on the same piece, was a lot more common because people were actually pulling heater cores out of, out of cars and using them as water cooling radiators.
[1724.00 → 1726.00] Yeah.
[1726.00 → 1731.00] So, okay, apparently water wetter is used in motorcycles.
[1731.00 → 1733.00] Apparently, that's, that's what it's for.
[1733.00 → 1734.00] I thought it was automotive.
[1734.00 → 1740.00] Anyway, the point is that it has always been true, and it continues to be true today.
[1740.00 → 1755.00] You know whether you're talking Lessor 1 or whether you're talking Fluid XP or whatever the case may be, pretty much any fluid that you put in a water cooling loop other than mineral oil, which I would strongly recommend against, because it'll destroy the hell of it.
[1755.00 → 1758.00] It'll destroy the hell out of all of your gaskets and tubing.
[1758.00 → 1759.00] So, please don't do that.
[1759.00 → 1762.00] Unless you're putting like mineral oil, or what's it called?
[1762.00 → 1763.00] Fluorine?
[1763.00 → 1764.00] That stuff from 3M?
[1764.00 → 1765.00] Yeah.
[1765.00 → 1766.00] Yeah.
[1766.00 → 1768.00] Or Fluorine or something into your tubing.
[1768.00 → 1774.00] Whatever you use will eventually become somewhat electrically conductive because that's just the way it works.
[1774.00 → 1775.00] All those coolers.
[1775.00 → 1776.00] Fluid XP is water-based.
[1776.00 → 1781.00] It just has some kind of glycol of some sort in it, and then it has something else in it.
[1781.00 → 1782.00] I can't remember.
[1782.00 → 1786.00] But eventually it'll pick up enough metal ions that it will become conductive.
[1786.00 → 1790.00] And the other thing is that the more you add to water, the worse it will perform.
[1790.00 → 1803.00] That's why if I'm actually building a water-cooled system that I actually intend to run for more than a couple of months as a showcase, then all I run is water with a couple drops of iodine or with a chunk of silver in it.
[1803.00 → 1806.00] That's the only thing you should use for the best performance.
[1806.00 → 1807.00] Yeah.
[1807.00 → 1808.00] And that makes sense chemically.
[1808.00 → 1812.00] I mean, you would want to use even like the metal ions that the water picks up.
[1812.00 → 1815.00] The water itself is going to conduct electricity because the water becomes ionized.
[1815.00 → 1822.00] So you would, I mean, you'd be probably, is there any mythology around using distilled water or something like that?
[1822.00 → 1825.00] Because it seems like that would also help it be more chemically stable.
[1825.00 → 1826.00] Yeah.
[1826.00 → 1830.00] A lot of people, a lot of people want to use distilled water in their loops.
[1830.00 → 1833.00] A lot of people say that's the best thing to use personally.
[1833.00 → 1836.00] We don't have particularly heavy tap water around here anyway.
[1836.00 → 1838.00] So I've always, you know, it's hilarious.
[1838.00 → 1839.00] Okay.
[1839.00 → 1840.00] Okay.
[1840.00 → 1842.00] We're getting, we're all, we're digging up the stories now.
[1842.00 → 1851.00] So every time in a video, you've seen me pull out a jug of distilled water and pour it into a water cooling loop.
[1851.00 → 1854.00] I am just appeasing the distilled water fanboys.
[1854.00 → 1856.00] That's tap water.
[1856.00 → 1860.00] I drank the distilled water, or I found a jug somewhere.
[1860.00 → 1862.00] Like it doesn't matter.
[1862.00 → 1863.00] It's fine.
[1863.00 → 1865.00] I won't tell anybody if you don't.
[1865.00 → 1866.00] Yeah, that's right.
[1866.00 → 1871.00] So, so yeah, there's that.
[1871.00 → 1875.00] And Twitch chats, freaking out.
[1875.00 → 1876.00] Twitch chats, freaking out.
[1876.00 → 1879.00] Yeah, no, I, it, it, it doesn't make a difference.
[1879.00 → 1884.00] You know what I do have to jump into now is our sponsor spots for the show today.
[1884.00 → 1886.00] We have gotten through almost no topics.
[1886.00 → 1891.00] It's amazing how long, how much time you can kill just shooting the breeze.
[1891.00 → 1894.00] So our first sponsor of the day is FreshBooks.
[1894.00 → 1900.00] FreshBooks is the easy to use invoicing software that helps small businesses look professional and get paid faster.
[1900.00 → 1905.00] Though that's not to say that, like, it's, it's all about looking more professional.
[1905.00 → 1916.00] It's, it actually makes you more professional when you track your expenses accurately, and you track your hours accurately, and you send your invoices on time, and you have ways for people to pay.
[1916.00 → 1918.00] They've actually got a card reader now.
[1918.00 → 1920.00] So they've got a way to pay through the card reader.
[1920.00 → 1922.00] They've got a way to pay through the FreshBooks platform.
[1922.00 → 1928.00] All this stuff legitimately makes you more organized and more professional.
[1928.00 → 1933.00] They've actually even got a feature that lets you know if your clients looked at the invoice.
[1933.00 → 1937.00] So that eliminates the guessing games of like, oh, I'm sorry.
[1937.00 → 1942.00] I didn't pay for little Sally's, uh, you know, Boyce ball lesson or whatever the case may be.
[1942.00 → 1946.00] Um, I didn't see the invoice, but can you teach her today anyway?
[1946.00 → 1951.00] No, little Sally sits out today because I know you saw the invoice.
[1951.00 → 1952.00] You just didn't pay it.
[1952.00 → 1955.00] Or you could be merciful, and you could let little Sally play Boyce ball.
[1955.00 → 1959.00] Does anyone in the does anyone in Twitch chat even know what Boyce ball is?
[1959.00 → 1961.00] I don't have a clue.
[1961.00 → 1963.00] It's lawn darts, but with balls.
[1963.00 → 1964.00] Ah, okay.
[1964.00 → 1970.00] So you throw a little ball, and then you throw a big ball and then someone else's throws a big ball, and you throw your big ball.
[1970.00 → 1971.00] Whoever's closest wins.
[1971.00 → 1974.00] It's like curling for Americans where they don't have ice.
[1974.00 → 1980.00] I think lawn darts are illegal here in the U S lawn darts are super illegal in the U S and in Canada.
[1980.00 → 1985.00] I've been trying to get my hands on a set for a, for a channel super fun video for quite some time.
[1985.00 → 1988.00] They're illegal to sell, illegal to buy illegal to own.
[1988.00 → 1991.00] Um, they're basically illegal in every possible way.
[1991.00 → 1995.00] So I've, I've been having a fair bit of difficulty getting my hands on any of that stuff.
[1995.00 → 2002.00] Uh, it sounds like you need to talk to a metal fabricator, and they can make you some, can they probably be even more badass than the originals.
[2002.00 → 2003.00] Wow.
[2003.00 → 2004.00] Yeah.
[2004.00 → 2013.00] We could have like, instead of like a nine-inch-long spike, we could have like a 16-inch-long spike, and they could be like, they could, the whole thing could be like three feet long, giant lawn.
[2013.00 → 2017.00] That's actually not a terrible, I mean, it's a terrible idea, but it's a fun idea.
[2017.00 → 2019.00] It's the best kind of terrible idea.
[2019.00 → 2021.00] Uh, I do have one more sponsor spot.
[2021.00 → 2022.00] Dun dun dun dun dun.
[2022.00 → 2023.00] Vertical.
[2023.00 → 2026.00] You can check out Vertical's gaming chairs over at vertigear.com.
[2026.00 → 2029.00] So the one that I'm sitting in, this is the S line.
[2029.00 → 2030.00] There you go.
[2030.00 → 2032.00] You got a little Vertical logo over there.
[2032.00 → 2034.00] Just takes one person to assemble the chair.
[2034.00 → 2036.00] I'm not actually quite sure how that's a selling point.
[2036.00 → 2041.00] I've never had enough difficulty assembling a chair that I needed someone to help me unless it was from Ikea.
[2041.00 → 2045.00] And that has nothing to do with the difficulty of assembling the chair and more to do with the documentation.
[2045.00 → 2047.00] It glides very smoothly on any surface.
[2047.00 → 2051.00] The tall backrest is meant for the neck, shoulders and lumbar support.
[2051.00 → 2057.00] And like the plus line, which I was supposed to tell you about first apparently, but the plus line is the chair that Luke normally sits in.
[2057.00 → 2060.00] As you can see, there is no chair and there is no Luke.
[2060.00 → 2062.00] Like the plus line, you can adjust the seat to fit your height.
[2062.00 → 2068.00] It's got an adjustable armrest, which is cushioned for the arm as opposed to cushion for your balls, I suppose.
[2068.00 → 2070.00] Which is good because most people don't sit on the armrest.
[2070.00 → 2074.00] In order to prevent stress, relieve muscle strain as well as any other shoulder or wrist pain.
[2074.00 → 2077.00] I don't know how the armrest affects wrist pain, but okay.
[2077.00 → 2080.00] The knob under the seat can be set in order to match your weight.
[2080.00 → 2083.00] So you can rock and tilt with ease and that actually does work quite well.
[2083.00 → 2086.00] And the backrest can be changed from 80 degrees to 150 degrees.
[2086.00 → 2093.00] So you can check out their gaming chairs at vertigear.com or at the link below, which says video description.
[2093.00 → 2096.00] Don't copy this. Copy below and paste that, please.
[2096.00 → 2098.00] Thank you, Colton, for putting that in there.
[2098.00 → 2100.00] All right.
[2100.00 → 2103.00] So why don't we jump into some of our other topics here?
[2103.00 → 2105.00] What else do we got that's like interesting?
[2105.00 → 2106.00] I don't even know.
[2106.00 → 2108.00] This is like zoomed in so far.
[2108.00 → 2110.00] It's the post CES slow season.
[2110.00 → 2111.00] It's been slow for us too on the news.
[2111.00 → 2112.00] I know.
[2112.00 → 2113.00] There's like nothing.
[2113.00 → 2118.00] I mean, ex-Verizon lawyer is now the chair of the FCC.
[2118.00 → 2119.00] Okay.
[2119.00 → 2121.00] So that's just terrible.
[2121.00 → 2125.00] Let's wait and see what evil things he does before we make fun of him.
[2125.00 → 2126.00] Okay.
[2126.00 → 2127.00] Sure.
[2127.00 → 2130.00] In the meantime, there's a link to the Ars Technica article that that's from.
[2130.00 → 2131.00] Yeah.
[2131.00 → 2132.00] Okay.
[2132.00 → 2133.00] Oh, man.
[2133.00 → 2134.00] I.
[2134.00 → 2135.00] Yeah.
[2135.00 → 2136.00] Okay.
[2136.00 → 2143.00] We've been cutting back on the political sort of nature of the show ever since we got sort
[2143.00 → 2150.00] of roasted for talking about nothing but Donald Trump for an entire episode of what is purportedly
[2150.00 → 2151.00] a tech show.
[2151.00 → 2155.00] Oh, the schadenfreude for my countrymen.
[2155.00 → 2156.00] All right.
[2156.00 → 2164.00] Oh, Vivaldi, CEO, calls on Microsoft to quote unquote, do the right thing and stop aggressive edge pushing.
[2164.00 → 2174.00] So how excited do you get when you're sitting there using Windows, because I know using Windows gets all your juices going.
[2174.00 → 2183.00] When you're sitting there using Windows 10 and you open up another browser, and you get a little pop-up, little pop up from the taskbar.
[2183.00 → 2189.00] It's all like, hey, did you know that Chrome is 22% faster than some arbitrary thing we pulled out of our butt?
[2189.00 → 2190.00] Edge.
[2190.00 → 2192.00] Did you know that Edge is.
[2192.00 → 2193.00] Did I say Chrome?
[2193.00 → 2194.00] Okay.
[2194.00 → 2195.00] Yeah.
[2195.00 → 2196.00] Chrome's not faster than anything.
[2196.00 → 2198.00] That was obviously an error.
[2198.00 → 2199.00] It's been doing that.
[2199.00 → 2204.00] I mean, maybe it's because I'm on the insider build on the Windows machines that I have to use regularly.
[2204.00 → 2206.00] I'm not sure, but it's been doing that for like six months.
[2206.00 → 2207.00] But it's not just Chrome.
[2207.00 → 2209.00] It's been doing it with a lot of things.
[2209.00 → 2210.00] Yeah.
[2210.00 → 2216.00] Even just like the office pop-ups, and it's like, oh, let's get Microsoft Office and let's do a trial.
[2216.00 → 2219.00] But the version of Microsoft Office that I have is for developers.
[2219.00 → 2221.00] And so it's like, I've got Microsoft Office installed.
[2221.00 → 2226.00] Some dumb ass programmer didn't take into account if you're running the developer version of Office.
[2226.00 → 2229.00] Yeah.
[2229.00 → 2232.00] So basically it's addressing.
[2232.00 → 2234.00] So this is kind of the quote.
[2234.00 → 2238.00] So it addresses how Microsoft's anti-competitive practices create problems for the user.
[2238.00 → 2245.00] So John tells a story about how a friend of his had her PC upgraded from Windows 8 to Windows 10 with the browser being changed to Edge.
[2245.00 → 2248.00] And again, another quote.
[2248.00 → 2253.00] Instead of building a better browser, Microsoft is forcing its product onto people in the most unapologetic manner.
[2253.00 → 2257.00] So I actually was planning to make a video about this.
[2257.00 → 2261.00] I switched to Edge for-
[2261.00 → 2262.00] Edge has better battery life.
[2262.00 → 2267.00] About two weeks because I was trying to address the abominable battery life with Chrome.
[2267.00 → 2270.00] I'm a bit of a tab monster.
[2270.00 → 2272.00] This is something I'm attending regular meetings.
[2272.00 → 2273.00] I'm working on it.
[2273.00 → 2275.00] I have a sponsor.
[2275.00 → 2276.00] So I'm a bit of a tab addict.
[2276.00 → 2282.00] And I mean, I was getting like a couple of hours of battery on my laptop, which is like not very good.
[2282.00 → 2288.00] So I was like, okay, I heard from Microsoft that Edge has much better battery life.
[2288.00 → 2289.00] I'm going to try it.
[2289.00 → 2292.00] It's just such a piece of garbage.
[2292.00 → 2295.00] I mean, just fundamental stuff.
[2295.00 → 2296.00] Okay.
[2296.00 → 2301.00] And I don't know if this will happen on every machine, but on my machine, it definitely does.
[2301.00 → 2314.00] If I click a link, if I click a link in an email, in Gmail, in my browser, it manages to crash not only the tab that spawns, but also the tab with my Gmail in it.
[2314.00 → 2317.00] Maybe like 60% of the time.
[2317.00 → 2319.00] Like if I do a middle click.
[2319.00 → 2320.00] That's surprising.
[2320.00 → 2323.00] I'm sitting here going, this is ridiculous.
[2323.00 → 2326.00] How can anything be this unstable?
[2326.00 → 2329.00] And there are all kinds of just rendering issues.
[2329.00 → 2334.00] All kinds of crashing that I mean, I don't know what browser to use anymore.
[2334.00 → 2335.00] What are you using?
[2335.00 → 2336.00] Chromium.
[2336.00 → 2339.00] Chromium is a build of Chrome with all the Google stuff stripped out.
[2339.00 → 2340.00] Yeah.
[2340.00 → 2347.00] And actually the Canary build, which is like the, well, Canary is the developer build of Chrome.
[2347.00 → 2348.00] It's like Chrome plus one.
[2348.00 → 2349.00] It's like the next version.
[2349.00 → 2350.00] Yeah.
[2350.00 → 2352.00] There's a setting that you can tweak in Chrome.
[2352.00 → 2355.00] So the non-active tabs don't get a CPU.
[2355.00 → 2356.00] Oh, okay.
[2356.00 → 2359.00] And so like any kind of like a background, most of its advertisers fault, honestly.
[2359.00 → 2360.00] Yeah.
[2360.00 → 2364.00] Because there's like all kinds of JavaScript stuff like that running in the background of the tabs.
[2364.00 → 2366.00] That's what's chewing up your battery because Chrome was like, yeah, sure.
[2366.00 → 2367.00] Let's keep going.
[2367.00 → 2368.00] Sure.
[2368.00 → 2369.00] 8% of the battery to this tab.
[2369.00 → 2370.00] Sure.
[2370.00 → 2371.00] No problem.
[2371.00 → 2372.00] Yeah.
[2372.00 → 2373.00] And animations is also the thing.
[2373.00 → 2379.00] A lot of like when you implement animations with JavaScript, if you don't use like request animation frame, they'll just run continuously.
[2379.00 → 2380.00] Right.
[2380.00 → 2381.00] Right.
[2381.00 → 2385.00] And so nobody knows to use request animation frame.
[2385.00 → 2387.00] So it's bad.
[2387.00 → 2390.00] But if you get the Canary version, there's a tweak that you can enable.
[2390.00 → 2394.00] And it may be, I think it's going to be in Chrome 56, 55, 56.
[2394.00 → 2395.00] I think 55 is out now.
[2395.00 → 2397.00] It's probably going to be in 56.
[2397.00 → 2404.00] And when you enable that option, you should have reasonable battery life again from Super Mega.
[2404.00 → 2407.00] I too have a problem with a lot of tabs.
[2407.00 → 2409.00] And so, yeah.
[2409.00 → 2410.00] Yeah.
[2410.00 → 2411.00] It's okay.
[2411.00 → 2413.00] You can join my support group if you ever move out to the West Coast.
[2413.00 → 2414.00] This is great.
[2414.00 → 2418.00] Just one person's complaint about Chrome really struck a chord with me.
[2419.00 → 2429.00] How is it even possible that they still do this bull crap where the first time you launch it, the address bar is here for some reason?
[2429.00 → 2430.00] Why?
[2430.00 → 2431.00] Why?
[2431.00 → 2432.00] Why?
[2432.00 → 2438.00] It's like nobody in the Microsoft UX team for Edge has ever heard of muscle memory.
[2439.00 → 2440.00] Ever.
[2440.00 → 2444.00] I think that this UI might be designed for geriatrics.
[2445.00 → 2448.00] Because I could see how this might be easy for old people.
[2448.00 → 2449.00] Hmm.
[2449.00 → 2450.00] Hmm.
[2450.00 → 2451.00] Hmm.
[2451.00 → 2452.00] Hmm.
[2452.00 → 2461.00] You know what's hilarious though is there's actually been, I'm trying to think of what the other thing that really had me thinking about that recently was.
[2461.00 → 2474.00] I don't remember if it was like an iPhone thing or an Android thing or a Windows thing, but I was going through this a little while ago where I kind of, it kind of dawned on me because I was sitting there thinking this product is a piece of garbage.
[2474.00 → 2475.00] How could anybody like this?
[2475.00 → 2478.00] And then I went, wow, old people.
[2478.00 → 2479.00] That's it.
[2479.00 → 2482.00] And it was such an epiphany for me.
[2482.00 → 2487.00] Um, alright, so HP laptops caught fire or something.
[2487.00 → 2488.00] I don't know.
[2488.00 → 2489.00] It's a battery's catching fire.
[2489.00 → 2492.00] It feels like it's not even news at this point.
[2492.00 → 2493.00] A certain level.
[2493.00 → 2494.00] Yeah.
[2494.00 → 2495.00] Well, it's just, it's entropy.
[2495.00 → 2498.00] I mean, you cram a lot of energy in a small space, it can't wait to catch on fire.
[2498.00 → 2501.00] I mean, that's, again, back to physics.
[2501.00 → 2503.00] No, no, physics is boring.
[2503.00 → 2504.00] We don't talk about that on the show.
[2504.00 → 2506.00] No physics, no politics.
[2506.00 → 2510.00] You keep your physics and your politics, and you go, you put it on level one text.
[2510.00 → 2511.00] That's the plan.
[2511.00 → 2512.00] We can talk about it.
[2512.00 → 2514.00] Well, not the politics.
[2514.00 → 2519.00] We killed politics on our forum because the mods were like, I'm tired, and I want to go home.
[2519.00 → 2522.00] And it's like, okay, we'll eliminate politics as not related to tech.
[2522.00 → 2524.00] And they're like, they're peppy and happy again.
[2524.00 → 2525.00] It's really nice.
[2525.00 → 2526.00] It's great.
[2526.00 → 2532.00] So there are a bunch more details on the Nintendo.co.uk website about the Switch.
[2532.00 → 2537.00] So they've got like a whole like diagram and everything, game cards sold separately, technical
[2537.00 → 2542.00] specifications, all of this good stuff that Nintendo has been kind of keeping to themselves
[2542.00 → 2545.00] for the most part up until this time.
[2545.00 → 2548.00] Actually, I don't know what Luke is learning at the event that he's at right now.
[2548.00 → 2551.00] But how excited are you about the Switch?
[2551.00 → 2552.00] Not at all.
[2552.00 → 2553.00] Oh, okay.
[2553.00 → 2554.00] Well, that was quick.
[2554.00 → 2555.00] Care to clarify why?
[2555.00 → 2561.00] So I really like, like, so I grew up, I had a Nintendo, the original Nintendo, like
[2561.00 → 2564.00] the original, original one, and a Super Nintendo.
[2564.00 → 2565.00] And I really liked them.
[2565.00 → 2569.00] I really loved the titles, Zelda, you know, Super Mario Brothers, all that.
[2569.00 → 2570.00] I really, really liked that.
[2570.00 → 2576.00] Nintendo has screwed the pooch so much with community and like understanding the community
[2576.00 → 2579.00] understanding who their consumer is that I just don't care anymore.
[2579.00 → 2581.00] And it's really sad to say that.
[2581.00 → 2582.00] Like, I hate to be like that.
[2582.00 → 2587.00] Because, you know, like the NEW Mini, like the NEW Classic, whatever the new one is that
[2587.00 → 2591.00] came out that runs the emulator, and it's probably some version of Linux and whatever.
[2591.00 → 2594.00] I, I, 60 bucks, I might buy that.
[2594.00 → 2598.00] But I have a real hard time supporting Nintendo just because of the way, like the lets plays
[2598.00 → 2602.00] and like the aggressive quote unquote protection of the IP.
[2602.00 → 2603.00] Right.
[2603.00 → 2608.00] It's just, it's like, so I don't know.
[2608.00 → 2614.00] Yeah, I, I, I share, I share your frustration.
[2614.00 → 2620.00] I really think, I really don't, I mean, how do, how do I put this?
[2620.00 → 2624.00] Like, I've run into situations a number of times in the past where I've kind of gone,
[2624.00 → 2627.00] you know what, I'm sure I'll be fine to do X.
[2627.00 → 2630.00] So we, oh, okay, here's a perfect example.
[2630.00 → 2636.00] So we use a few frames from an, from an episode of South Park in a video that will be coming up very soon.
[2636.00 → 2641.00] So I actually purchased a child tracker, like a GPS child tracker.
[2641.00 → 2647.00] So South Park did an episode about 15 years ago where all the kids get equipped with this like headgear
[2647.00 → 2651.00] with satellite dishes and stuff going around and because all the parents are concerned they'll get,
[2651.00 → 2652.00] they'll get kidnapped.
[2652.00 → 2655.00] And so every once in a while I will do something like that.
[2655.00 → 2658.00] And I'll kind of go, because I, I nod to the episode.
[2658.00 → 2665.00] I go, you know, it's amazing how often South Park calls it 15 years ago, they did this episode, and we use a couple,
[2665.00 → 2667.00] a couple frames from it.
[2667.00 → 2670.00] And here we are all this time ahead.
[2670.00 → 2674.00] And here I am reviewing a child tracker, the child tracker 9,000 or whatever.
[2674.00 → 2680.00] So every once in a while I will do something like that where I'll go, they get nothing but benefit from this.
[2680.00 → 2682.00] Technically I am on the wrong side of the law.
[2682.00 → 2683.00] I understand that.
[2683.00 → 2691.00] I have, I have broken their copyright here, but I haven't given away any of the real meaning of the content.
[2691.00 → 2695.00] It's not like you had the experience of watching the episode from the chunk that I used.
[2695.00 → 2706.00] It illustrated my point incredibly well, and they got nothing but praise and positive, encouraging support for the wonderful program they've been producing for so long out of this few seconds of footage.
[2706.00 → 2711.00] Realistically, I consider myself protected by the, the human being factor.
[2711.00 → 2720.00] Someone, somewhere, would have to decide that it is worth the, the bad will that they're going to generate to sue me over this.
[2720.00 → 2725.00] And I consider that a reasonable protection in a lot of cases.
[2725.00 → 2730.00] Nintendo breaks that, that kind of that covenant.
[2730.00 → 2731.00] Yeah.
[2731.00 → 2732.00] Constantly.
[2732.00 → 2733.00] Constantly.
[2733.00 → 2742.00] Where there's nothing in, there's nothing in this for me other than being like a Nintendo fan or like, you know, spreading the Nintendo gospel.
[2742.00 → 2747.00] And you get nothing but negative publicity out of going after me for this, but they just do it anyway.
[2747.00 → 2752.00] Did you see what Jim Sterling, what he figured out to combat Nintendo?
[2752.00 → 2753.00] It's amazing.
[2753.00 → 2754.00] No, I didn't.
[2754.00 → 2764.00] So he was doing a review of something Nintendo, and he used some, he used a clip that he knew would be flagged by Nintendo of America, just like one or two seconds.
[2764.00 → 2767.00] And he used another clip that Nintendo Japan would flag.
[2767.00 → 2772.00] And because both of them have claimed his video, neither one of them get any revenue.
[2775.00 → 2778.00] I haven't seen the video, but I actually did hear about that.
[2778.00 → 2779.00] That is fantastic.
[2779.00 → 2780.00] That's how it's done.
[2780.00 → 2781.00] The master troll.
[2781.00 → 2782.00] Let's see what else we got here.
[2782.00 → 2783.00] Oh, this is pretty good.
[2783.00 → 2784.00] Microsoft HoloLens.
[2784.00 → 2792.00] The Microsoft admits that sales figures are in the thousands, but that's all they need, says the headset's commercial lead.
[2792.00 → 2805.00] So the original article here is from the inquirer.net.
[2805.00 → 2810.00] Man, I remember when that site used to be like the go to for all the dirt.
[2810.00 → 2818.00] You know, 5,000 doesn't sound like many, but if those are developers and like hardcore users, that actually could be a big deal.
[2818.00 → 2823.00] I mean, assuming that let's say, I mean, I wouldn't be dropping, what is it?
[2823.00 → 2829.00] 2,000 pounds or 4,000 pounds, depending on the dev only version or the enterprise model.
[2829.00 → 2831.00] I wouldn't be dropping that kind of money on it.
[2831.00 → 2843.00] If I wasn't either a developer looking to build an application that I expect others to use or a high-end big business user who's looking to develop something for internal use.
[2843.00 → 2848.00] So there will be applications for it based on those kinds of sales numbers.
[2848.00 → 2852.00] I mean, I'm not as I'm not as what is it?
[2852.00 → 2854.00] Bear or bearish.
[2854.00 → 2857.00] Bear in a bull on the thing.
[2857.00 → 2858.00] Bullish.
[2858.00 → 2859.00] Bullish. No, bullish is good.
[2859.00 → 2860.00] So I'm bullish.
[2860.00 → 2861.00] I'm not bear.
[2861.00 → 2862.00] Bull or bear market.
[2862.00 → 2864.00] I don't know the opposite of bullish.
[2864.00 → 2865.00] I'm sorry.
[2865.00 → 2868.00] I'm looking like an idiot to Twitch chat, but I'm sure they already thought that anyway.
[2868.00 → 2871.00] All right.
[2871.00 → 2874.00] Ooh, this is exciting.
[2874.00 → 2877.00] So the original article here is from Engadget.com.
[2877.00 → 2878.00] Let's go ahead and pull that up here.
[2878.00 → 2884.00] The first Ultra HD Blu-ray PC drive ships next month.
[2884.00 → 2886.00] Only there's a catch.
[2886.00 → 2889.00] And I'm sure I'm going to get some ranting from you on this.
[2889.00 → 2902.00] You must have a Kaby Lake processor and Windows 10 to play your UHD 4K HDR movies off the disc.
[2902.00 → 2912.00] So just like Netflix 4K streaming, we are looking at hardware DRM built into your Intel CPU in order to play back the content.
[2912.00 → 2913.00] What do you think?
[2913.00 → 2914.00] Go.
[2914.00 → 2915.00] Go, Wendell.
[2915.00 → 2917.00] Well, so, okay.
[2917.00 → 2922.00] Before we talk about the DRM part of it, there is actually a legit technical reason for that.
[2922.00 → 2933.00] And the legit technical reason is that Kaby Lake has hardware acceleration not found on any other CPU that will hardware accelerate the decoding of this content.
[2933.00 → 2941.00] Because if you've got a low-end Kaby Lake SKU, like a portable device, an i3, something like that, it's not going to perform well.
[2941.00 → 2944.00] It's going to get hot, and it's going to run the battery down.
[2944.00 → 2950.00] So, like, if you've got, you know, a Surface Pro 4 and, well, a Surface Pro 5 because Kaby Lake.
[2950.00 → 2959.00] Well, no, yeah, if you've got a Surface Pro 4 with a Skylike CPU and you wanted to watch high-def content, the battery is going to be dead in an hour, and it's going to be about 80 degrees C.
[2959.00 → 2960.00] Right.
[2960.00 → 2963.00] And so, okay, I could see some legitimacy in that.
[2963.00 → 2965.00] This is an internal drive.
[2965.00 → 2966.00] And so this is obviously…
[2966.00 → 2967.00] It's a 5 1⁄4-inch drive.
[2967.00 → 2968.00] Yeah.
[2968.00 → 2969.00] Yeah.
[2969.00 → 2970.00] So this is a little bit more about DRM.
[2970.00 → 2979.00] But how crazy is it that we've gotten to a point where the content manufacturers literally don't trust the computer.
[2979.00 → 2992.00] And so, like, the CPU and the DVD or the drive are going to have this secret private conversation that we're not allowed to know what it is, even though it's our own hardware, in order to be able to decode the hardware, decode the thing and send it on.
[2992.00 → 2995.00] That just seems a little, you know, anti-consumer to me.
[2995.00 → 2998.00] This just seems like the…
[2998.00 → 3003.00] This just basically seems like the content companies finally won the battle.
[3003.00 → 3004.00] I mean, it's…
[3004.00 → 3007.00] It is no great secret, I think…
[3007.00 → 3008.00] Okay, this is…
[3008.00 → 3014.00] Maybe this is my personal opinion, but I think piracy is ultimately what led to Windows being the dominant platform.
[3014.00 → 3015.00] Yeah.
[3015.00 → 3016.00] I think that pirated games…
[3016.00 → 3017.00] Oh, no, yeah.
[3017.00 → 3018.00] Yeah.
[3018.00 → 3020.00] Pirated content of all sorts.
[3020.00 → 3032.00] The fact that you had this one box that could play all the music, obtain all the music, play and obtain all the movies, play and obtain all the games for free, where it was like…
[3032.00 → 3039.00] You could justify at a time when a computer wasn't necessary for your job or anything you wanted to do.
[3039.00 → 3049.00] You could justify this multi-thousand dollar expense because it saved you so much money on all the music and movies and games you weren't going to buy.
[3049.00 → 3057.00] So, I believe very strongly that that's a huge part of why Microsoft and Intel had their success.
[3057.00 → 3058.00] Yeah.
[3058.00 → 3070.00] And it looks like they have finally given in and gone, okay, we're turning our back on the piracy, and we're kind of going, okay, we're going to hardware DRM this be…
[3070.00 → 3071.00] …not much.
[3071.00 → 3073.00] So, there you have it then.
[3073.00 → 3075.00] That's pretty much it.
[3075.00 → 3082.00] I imagine at some point someone will find some way to…
[3082.00 → 3083.00] To pull…
[3083.00 → 3084.00] To defeat it?
[3084.00 → 3085.00] Oh, yeah.
[3085.00 → 3086.00] To defeat it.
[3086.00 → 3087.00] No doubt.
[3087.00 → 3092.00] But it looks like this might be a bit more difficult than it has been in the past at the very least.
[3092.00 → 3104.00] Well, you know, the technical… I'm honestly not really worried about how difficult it is technically, but the political climate and the whole, like, you know, legal climate of that is really, really nuts.
[3104.00 → 3110.00] I mean, it's like, ah, manslaughter, ah, you broke the copy protection on a movie.
[3110.00 → 3115.00] It's kind of the same thing in terms of jail sentence and, you know, what you might be facing and stuff like that.
[3115.00 → 3116.00] I mean, how crazy is that?
[3116.00 → 3117.00] It's nuts.
[3117.00 → 3118.00] Yeah.
[3118.00 → 3131.00] I mean, I don't know if we've got time for it, but anecdotally, you know, I'll confess, I'm a consumer whore, and I picked up all the episodes of Star Trek The Next Generation on DVD, the remastered ones from 35mm.
[3131.00 → 3132.00] Oh, nice.
[3132.00 → 3133.00] Bought them all.
[3133.00 → 3138.00] And I transcoded them to my media server.
[3138.00 → 3144.00] And I will tell you that I would not enjoy the content at all if I had not transcoded it to the media server.
[3144.00 → 3147.00] I've got all the content, I've got all the special features, I've got everything.
[3147.00 → 3150.00] But it's like, I want to watch season four, episode two.
[3150.00 → 3152.00] Click, and I'm watching it.
[3152.00 → 3153.00] It is a two-second operation.
[3153.00 → 3154.00] Yep.
[3154.00 → 3160.00] If I had to deal with the bullshit of the disc, I would be ready to slit my wrists after two minutes and I still wouldn't be the episode.
[3160.00 → 3161.00] Are you a Plex guy?
[3161.00 → 3170.00] Yeah, well, I've got Plex, but I've also been experimenting, because Plex has done some weird stuff, and I'm experimenting with my sort of own home-cooked web thing.
[3170.00 → 3172.00] But yes, I love Plex, and we're going to do some videos on Plex.
[3172.00 → 3179.00] Jodi has gotten to the point where it will basically run as a full-fledged media server as well, and you don't really need the stuff with Plex.
[3179.00 → 3184.00] And you don't need the subscription or the account or anything with Plex either, that you would need with Plex.
[3184.00 → 3187.00] Yeah, Plex threw a free subscription at me, so I'm just using it.
[3187.00 → 3191.00] I didn't make any videos about it or anything, but I was like, okay.
[3191.00 → 3197.00] Plex is awesome, but five bucks a month, it's like, yeah, I've already...
[3197.00 → 3198.00] Yeah.
[3198.00 → 3209.00] I mean, I'm just frustrated because this means that all the content, even some of that I've bought, 4K HDR, I am not going to get to enjoy in 4K.
[3209.00 → 3216.00] The good news is that all of those discs came with a regular Blu-ray, so I will watch that in the meantime, I suppose.
[3216.00 → 3220.00] Well, I've really, really enjoyed the crispiness of Star Trek The Next Generation, the remastered stuff.
[3220.00 → 3222.00] They really did a nice job of that.
[3222.00 → 3223.00] I should watch it.
[3223.00 → 3229.00] I actually haven't watched Star Trek The Next Generation since they were airing new episodes, like as a kid, sitting on the couch with my dad.
[3230.00 → 3231.00] So that would probably be worthwhile.
[3231.00 → 3233.00] It's just as magical.
[3233.00 → 3242.00] I mean, it's like, they've done a really nice job, and it came from 35mm, so they redid the effects, but, you know, they haven't...
[3242.00 → 3243.00] It was not like Star Wars.
[3243.00 → 3244.00] Right.
[3244.00 → 3245.00] They kept everything exactly the way that...
[3245.00 → 3252.00] I haven't watched all of them from beginning to end, but I've watched some of my favourite episodes as I've had time, and I've been really, really happy with it.
[3252.00 → 3254.00] I'm really happy with the media server.
[3254.00 → 3260.00] Do you still spend about 60% of the time following the episode and 40% wondering how Patrick Stewart still looks the same?
[3260.00 → 3262.00] Yeah, he's kind of ageless, you know?
[3262.00 → 3263.00] Okay, it's amazing.
[3263.00 → 3264.00] It's really...
[3264.00 → 3266.00] All right.
[3266.00 → 3278.00] Well, on that note, our admiration, our mutual admiration for Patrick Stewart gets to be the end of the show, I think, because I have a badminton class that I have to be at in 42 minutes, and it's about a 45-minute drive.
[3278.00 → 3281.00] So, thank you very much for joining me on the show.
[3281.00 → 3287.00] Guys, you can find Wendell over at YouTube.com slash level techs.
[3287.00 → 3289.00] I'm going to have that linked to...
[3289.00 → 3291.00] Do you guys not have a vanity URL yet?
[3291.00 → 3294.00] I think it's just level1.tech.
[3294.00 → 3295.00] Uh...
[3295.00 → 3296.00] Level1.techs...
[3296.00 → 3298.00] Oh, no, there it is.
[3298.00 → 3301.00] YouTube.com slash C slash level techs.
[3301.00 → 3302.00] So, I'm going to drop that in the Twitch chat.
[3302.00 → 3304.00] I'm going to have that in the video description.
[3304.00 → 3316.00] Don't miss their content, because they actually take this whole, like, pfSense, Linux, enterprise-y security stuff seriously, whereas I'm just like a chimp with a hammer.
[3316.00 → 3317.00] Well, now, wait, wait.
[3317.00 → 3321.00] On last week's show, didn't you say that you hired a veteran IT guy or something?
[3321.00 → 3326.00] Yeah, but he's not quite like what you guys are doing either, but he's a lot better than me.
[3326.00 → 3329.00] But, yes, we have three guys joining us soon.
[3329.00 → 3333.00] I think that, you know, just looking at your growth over the last couple of years, I think that that will...
[3333.00 → 3335.00] You'll be fine.
[3335.00 → 3336.00] You'll be fine.
[3336.00 → 3337.00] Oh, I'll survive.
[3337.00 → 3339.00] I'll just keep making ugly keyboards.
[3339.00 → 3344.00] That's my, I think, second fastest to a million view video ever.
[3344.00 → 3347.00] Is I put gold keycaps on a keyboard.
[3347.00 → 3354.00] I mean, people are upset with me about, like, clickbait titles and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[3354.00 → 3356.00] And I'm like, yeah, I share your upset.
[3356.00 → 3359.00] I don't want that to be my best performing video of all time.
[3359.00 → 3363.00] Well, you've got the you started the trend with that, I think, with the Salamander keyboard.
[3363.00 → 3365.00] It's that modded Model M keyboard.
[3365.00 → 3367.00] That keyboard is nice.
[3367.00 → 3369.00] It's really cool, isn't it?
[3369.00 → 3374.00] All right, well, take care, and we will talk soon, okay?
[3374.00 → 3375.00] See ya.
[3375.00 → 3376.00] All right.
[3376.00 → 3377.00] And thank you for having me.
[3377.00 → 3378.00] Oh, yeah, my pleasure, of course.
[3378.00 → 3379.00] Ah-ha-ha-ha.
