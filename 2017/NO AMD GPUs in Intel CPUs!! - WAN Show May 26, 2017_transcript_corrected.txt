[0.00 → 2.00] Oh
[3.24 → 6.28] Okay, it is WAN showtime!
[7.18 → 9.18] And we're gonna
[9.84 → 15.14] Okay, are we kind of? No, now you're not. No, now you're too centre stage. Okay?
[15.16 → 21.12] This is the line of show not the wait. No, this is the WAN show. Okay, then okay fine. Come on
[22.04 → 24.04] Come on in here, buddy
[24.04 → 30.80] Speaking of come on in here, buddy. We were doing some weird stuff today. We were doing some real weird stuff today
[30.80 → 40.12] It involved drag. Yeah, it involved the lipstick. Yeah, part of drag fake moustaches involved fake moustaches it involved
[40.12 → 43.50] a cell phone and taking pictures
[44.78 → 47.62] Yeah, actually well no it's not as crazy as it sounds
[47.62 → 55.02] We were working on a piece for honour for the honour 6x phone, and actually I think it's I think it's going to be pretty fun
[55.02 → 57.24] It seems like it's going to be pretty entertaining
[57.80 → 60.20] Have you actually read the script or were you just kind of doing?
[60.20 → 63.22] No, I had no idea. Okay. That's why every time we got up to a shot
[63.22 → 66.20] I was like I don't know what I'm doing like I actually had no clue
[66.20 → 73.14] Okay, so the concept behind the video is its kind of like it's like the videos that I've hosted in the past
[73.14 → 80.90] Where I compared my generation to my kids generation and sort of the differences then versus now
[81.16 → 85.32] Okay, well this time it's now versus then yeah
[85.32 → 91.90] So I'm looking at my generation versus the baby boomers and the way that we use technology
[91.90 → 100.20] Yeah, and some of the ways that like you knowing technology might think certain things that they do is just silly and unnecessary and slow or whatever
[100.20 → 106.22] Solutions that are obvious to us. Yeah, and not as obvious to our parents and our grandparents
[106.22 → 111.50] So I should actually be a pretty fun little video. It's its a lot better. We made it sound kind of lame
[111.82 → 116.00] well, I made it yeah, well part of the part of the added bonus is that like
[116.76 → 123.88] So far at least all the characters are played by Linus and me yes, so Linus is played by Linus and then like
[123.88 → 131.50] I don't know is it just grandma my grandma is played by me. Yeah, my aunt is played by him. Yeah, my dad is definitely played
[131.50 → 133.06] Yeah
[133.06 → 137.72] So we kind of went full Monty Python on like the female characters all being
[138.84 → 141.32] Okay, and they got me a medium dress
[141.80 → 147.64] Well, okay, I don't even fit medium. Oh, I guess it wasn't for me, but like I don't even fit medium
[147.64 → 151.88] Hey men's clothes. They bought me a medium dress you volunteer
[153.08 → 159.60] Cram yourself into it. I can still feel it under here. There was like barely room for him to stuff the front
[159.60 → 165.56] Yeah, yeah, the good news was it was so tight that you were able to stuff the front without needing a bra. Yes. Yeah
[166.84 → 168.84] microfiber
[170.58 → 175.38] Anyway, we've got a great show for you guys this week and oh for crying out loud
[175.38 → 181.00] I didn't change the name of the bloody stream again. Is it ah yeah the float party
[181.00 → 185.06] Dang dig gosh darn damn it the wet and the wind show
[187.42 → 189.58] Tech okay, do you want to tell them what topics we got?
[192.06 → 194.16] Sure no I do the Intel
[194.74 → 200.62] Intel is going to be doing some stuff with Thunderbolt 3 they can bring it to more things and I think they're like opening it up a little bit
[200.76 → 205.10] So it should be more common which is perfect. That's exciting. Yeah, also
[205.38 → 211.16] There has been a squashed rumour AMD will not be licensing graphics chips to Intel not going to be a thing
[211.92 → 214.84] Google has made the ultimate marketing tool which is
[215.66 → 221.72] Way creepier than it sounds, although you might have seen that coming and then Intel it has
[222.30 → 228.62] Well Intel not necessarily, but someone has leaked some benchmarks of Intel 7900 X and a gigabyte X
[228.62 → 233.58] 299 Boris gaming 7, and we have those details there are some very
[234.30 → 240.24] Interesting specs in that league so without further ado. Let's roll the intro that works with music
[241.16 → 245.64] It will, it's been doing pretty good lately. I guess we'll have no idea
[245.64 → 247.64] I have no idea
[257.64 → 260.22] People are like they finally arrived on time to a LAN show
[260.60 → 265.04] But they're probably in like other time zones and don't realize that we're actually like
[265.74 → 272.08] Almost an hour because they think we're eight minutes early because it's yeah because daylight savings instead of 52 minutes late
[274.92 → 278.28] Hey, we appreciate your vote of confidence
[280.02 → 281.86] You guys are uh
[281.86 → 286.24] You guys are wonderful. Yeah, and there's nothing I can do about the fan this razor blade
[286.24 → 291.18] This is my old blade because I accidentally left my backpack at work. This razor blade is like
[292.12 → 294.12] super not thrilled also
[294.32 → 299.68] There's more background noise in general in the warehouse right now because as some of you
[300.28 → 307.08] Doubted actually there were a lot of comments when I forget who posted it on social picture the picture of the empty warehouse
[307.08 → 312.00] They're like why would you post a picture of the warehouse before you moved in now, and we're like, oh
[312.00 → 317.76] Oh, oh because that's what it looks like right now. So this place is a freaking
[318.42 → 320.86] construction zone it is going to be
[322.26 → 326.38] So they thought it was like a nostalgia pick yes, no, that's that like
[326.90 → 330.24] Torn apart mess is the warehouse currently yeah
[330.24 → 336.90] And the upstairs is full of like pretty much everything that was in that part of the warehouse both Colton and Nick
[336.90 → 343.66] So the whole thing where they're in like a sales office, that's like clearly a one person sized office, and they're both in there
[344.24 → 346.24] that's because
[346.54 → 351.66] We don't have any room to put them anywhere else. So that's where they are. We're we're renovating
[351.66 → 356.70] So we're updating the sets we are we're building out a mezzanine that well
[356.70 → 362.94] Okay, so it was originally supposed to be a mezzanine for storage of like yeah cases and monitors and boxes
[362.94 → 368.78] Okay, that actually takes up a ridiculous amount of space after a while. Yeah, oh, and it like becomes a problem
[369.16 → 371.94] Because you can't really get rid of this stuff. So
[373.50 → 375.50] Got to put it do somewhere
[375.60 → 377.24] And then it turned into no
[377.24 → 383.64] Why don't we make that actual office space because it was an opportunity to deal with a couple of problems that had crept up on us
[383.64 → 387.38] Two bathrooms is actually not really quite enough
[387.38 → 393.60] You know if you know, let's say okay, let's say a couple of people at LMG go out for dinner the night before
[393.60 → 396.74] And let's say oh they both get a bad case of the wow
[396.74 → 398.90] I got to sit in the bathroom for a long time at a time
[398.90 → 401.14] Well, a third person has no way to use a bathroom
[401.14 → 402.50] So we kind of needed another bathroom
[402.50 → 407.06] We are getting to the point where there's like sometimes lineups of more than one person waiting
[407.06 → 409.84] And for the microwave yeah
[409.84 → 413.82] So we kind of needed another like kitchenette or a bigger one
[413.82 → 418.42] But like obviously we can't go back and like to do that now that that that's not a thing
[418.42 → 423.38] Yeah, you know, we did actually discuss putting another kitchen on the other side of the same wall
[423.38 → 425.68] So we wouldn't have to redo any of the plumbing
[425.68 → 427.58] That would have to be a lot easier
[427.58 → 431.28] But now that we're going to have this space, and it can serve
[431.28 → 433.30] It makes sense more to have it somewhere else
[433.30 → 434.64] It'd just be easier to do it here
[434.64 → 440.92] So there's that and then there was one person in particular, and I'm not going to name any names
[440.92 → 444.84] Everyone's asked I hate to say it
[444.84 → 445.80] Someone who really wanted
[445.80 → 450.08] A shower
[450.08 → 452.14] A shower
[452.14 → 453.06] Wait, we are getting one?
[453.66 → 454.52] We're getting a shower
[454.52 → 457.12] Oh, what the timing
[457.12 → 458.66] The timing
[458.66 → 462.94] Yeah, so funny story like he might not be here that long
[462.94 → 467.14] Um, because flow plane media is probably going to get its own space
[467.14 → 468.42] It's going to be like
[468.42 → 469.72] Finally won't have my shower
[469.72 → 471.72] It's going to be a bank AF like
[471.72 → 472.28] Oh terrible
[472.28 → 472.92] The Least space
[472.92 → 473.14] Yeah
[473.14 → 475.80] There's no way it's going to have like nice facilities
[475.80 → 478.46] Because I mean we don't know how fast the company is going to grow
[478.46 → 483.14] The last thing we're going to do is like to invest heavily into renovating a space
[483.14 → 485.14] Only to be like
[485.14 → 486.22] Well that was a great six weeks
[486.22 → 486.62] Yeah
[486.62 → 489.14] Yeah
[489.14 → 491.02] Um, so
[491.02 → 492.38] I'll just have to come here and shower
[492.38 → 494.28] No, there will not be a fire pole
[494.28 → 495.30] And yes, you are
[495.30 → 500.18] You are more than welcome to shower in our definitely not monitored shower
[500.18 → 502.90] Anytime you want, babe
[502.90 → 503.80] I'm okay with that
[503.80 → 504.94] Um, alright
[504.94 → 508.04] So why don't we jump into our first tech topic of the day
[508.04 → 508.40] Yeah
[508.40 → 511.72] This, I, I, you know what?
[511.78 → 513.34] I fell for it
[513.34 → 515.74] I did a little bit too
[515.74 → 517.02] I
[517.02 → 517.56] Unfortunately
[517.56 → 518.10] I
[518.10 → 520.72] I think because it would have been pretty cool
[520.72 → 522.54] So we were both like, you know what?
[522.60 → 522.86] Sure
[522.86 → 523.70] Yep
[523.70 → 525.98] I, I was down for
[525.98 → 529.16] So, so what made this rumour kind of credible
[529.16 → 534.66] And it was that AMD was going to be licensing chips to Intel for onboard graphics
[534.66 → 544.04] What made it somewhat credible to me was that Intel and Nvidia don't really work that closely together anymore
[544.04 → 545.10] Um
[545.10 → 548.46] It was, it was, okay
[548.46 → 557.12] It was rumour, and the rumour was because of a previous, previous licensing deal between Intel and Nvidia that expired in March
[557.12 → 563.68] And it was basically suggesting that Intel was licensing graphics IP from Nvidia
[563.68 → 565.98] And that deal had expired
[565.98 → 572.06] And rather than reach a new deal with Nvidia, they had worked with ATI Technologies Group
[572.06 → 576.40] Which, you know, owned by AMD, but, but sort of separate unit
[576.40 → 580.62] Um, to make sure that they weren't going to have any trouble with their own graphics chips
[580.62 → 585.70] And, you know, getting, uh, getting chased down due to patent infringements or whatever the case may be
[585.70 → 588.10] And it, it all kind of, like
[588.10 → 592.12] It all kind of made, made sense
[592.12 → 593.66] Um, sort of
[593.66 → 598.04] Except that I know that Intel actually has
[598.04 → 601.46] Invested very heavily in their own graphics
[601.46 → 601.78] Yeah
[601.78 → 604.26] Probably does own a lot of their own patents
[604.26 → 608.90] And at this point, for them to go ahead with what the, the rumour suggested
[608.90 → 613.86] And that was that Intel CPUs would have powered by Radeon graphics inside them
[613.86 → 615.82] Which would have actually been, like, pretty awesome
[615.82 → 616.26] That's, I think, again
[616.26 → 617.26] Best of both worlds
[617.26 → 619.74] That's, I think, again, why we sort of believed it to a certain degree
[619.74 → 622.10] Was, like, it didn't sound completely impossible
[622.10 → 623.92] And it would have been super cool
[623.92 → 624.14] Yeah
[624.14 → 627.52] But it's also, like, it, you know, I can see why not
[627.52 → 630.34] Because Intel has invested so heavily in their own graphics IP
[630.34 → 633.50] That for them to just kind of go, okay, yeah, well, no, what, you know what, forget it
[633.50 → 634.98] We're just going to use AMD tech
[634.98 → 637.42] Does seem a little hard to believe
[637.42 → 640.88] Especially when most folks aren't really complaining
[640.88 → 644.14] About Intel onboard graphics these days
[644.14 → 647.90] The other reason that, you know, looking back on it
[647.90 → 648.82] It, um
[648.82 → 651.62] That it doesn't make sense
[651.62 → 655.26] And this, this is, this is ultimately where the rumour got squashed
[655.26 → 656.96] So that's, uh, the article, uh, Fortune
[656.96 → 660.28] And that's where, you know, from my perspective
[660.28 → 663.76] I'm looking at it going, oh, yeah, Intel's got, still, whether you like it or not
[663.76 → 665.52] Still the best instruction for clock
[665.52 → 670.12] And they've got the highest clock speeds available on their chips
[670.12 → 673.16] So having an Intel CPU with AMD onboard graphics
[673.16 → 674.62] Would be kind of the best of both worlds
[674.62 → 678.62] But Dr. Sue from AMD came out and said
[678.62 → 683.02] Look, we're not looking at enabling a competitor to compete against our products
[683.02 → 685.24] It's not about how do we sell more products
[685.24 → 688.92] Or how do we have IP in markets where we're not currently selling products
[688.92 → 692.20] AMD just basically straight up said
[692.20 → 693.72] Even if Intel wanted it
[693.72 → 697.84] They're not looking to put AMD's graphics technology
[697.84 → 700.70] Which is good on Intel's CPUs
[700.70 → 703.76] They're going to keep it on AMD's CPUs
[703.76 → 705.30] And for now
[705.30 → 709.76] Those products are frankly not that compelling
[709.76 → 715.14] Because AMD's got their graphics technology on older series Apus
[715.14 → 720.58] That are running just what is not in terms of months or years
[720.58 → 723.10] Ancient architecturally
[723.10 → 727.48] But in terms of how much better the Encore is
[727.48 → 731.22] Ancient architecturally products
[731.22 → 736.04] So when they bring us Encore Apus
[736.04 → 737.14] All of a sudden
[737.14 → 742.44] I think mine and Luke's excitement about having Radeon graphics on Intel CPUs
[742.44 → 747.46] Doesn't really matter as much because you'll be able to get Radeon graphics on a Encore CPU
[747.46 → 747.88] So
[747.88 → 749.90] You know
[749.90 → 751.58] I was amped for it
[751.58 → 752.90] Not a thing
[752.90 → 754.46] But I'm not that disappointed
[754.46 → 756.06] So a lot of people are freaking out
[756.06 → 756.80] About?
[756.92 → 759.40] And there's like hashtag save Luke in the chat and stuff
[759.40 → 760.30] I'm not like
[760.30 → 761.34] He's not dying
[761.34 → 761.68] Yeah
[761.68 → 763.56] And like I'll still be around
[763.56 → 764.32] He's not fired
[764.32 → 766.22] I don't have any intent to not do WAN show
[766.22 → 768.92] And like I'm still planning on doing some videos here and there
[768.92 → 770.92] I'm definitely going to be on VR stuff
[770.92 → 772.14] Hopefully when it gets you know
[772.14 → 774.10] Like more interesting and better
[774.10 → 775.86] And then
[775.86 → 778.58] Like I have some videos coming down the chain
[778.58 → 780.34] If you have any
[780.34 → 781.82] Here help me out
[781.82 → 784.74] If you have any like really weird
[784.74 → 786.58] But kind of interesting
[786.58 → 788.20] Or unheard of
[788.20 → 790.22] But neat technology things
[790.22 → 791.42] That you know of
[791.42 → 792.82] Just hit me up on Twitter
[792.82 → 795.02] Down over there
[795.02 → 796.44] Twitch chat's freaking out
[796.44 → 797.32] We saved Luke
[797.32 → 799.70] Yeah
[799.70 → 800.54] You did it Reddit
[800.54 → 801.04] Oh
[801.04 → 810.32] Terrible
[810.32 → 811.86] Um
[811.86 → 816.66] What have we got for our next topic?
[817.18 → 817.84] I'll move us on
[817.84 → 818.58] Uh
[818.58 → 819.16] Ooh
[819.16 → 819.44] Okay
[819.44 → 820.40] This is cool though
[820.40 → 821.18] Because okay
[821.18 → 822.94] The last one is a little bit disappointing
[822.94 → 824.38] Because we both kind of wanted it to happen
[824.38 → 825.16] Because those would have been
[825.16 → 827.30] Really really really cool processors
[827.30 → 829.56] I personally would have liked to see them in laptops
[829.56 → 830.40] But
[830.40 → 832.34] This one does seem to be happening
[832.34 → 833.96] Don't believe it's a rumour
[833.96 → 834.62] Uh
[834.62 → 835.70] Intel's plan
[835.70 → 837.10] To Thunderbolt 3
[837.10 → 838.48] All the things
[838.48 → 839.74] So Thunderbolt 3
[839.74 → 840.94] Still hasn't gone mainstream
[840.94 → 842.50] Which has been frustrating for a lot of people
[842.50 → 844.78] Due to a combination of high cost and low availability
[844.78 → 846.68] Now Intel is taking two steps
[846.68 → 848.92] To accelerate the adoption of Thunderbolt 3
[848.92 → 850.48] They're integrating Thunderbolt 3
[850.48 → 852.40] Into Intel CPUs
[852.40 → 853.20] Finally
[853.20 → 854.04] Yes
[854.04 → 855.24] Thank you
[855.24 → 855.84] Yes
[855.84 → 857.84] Which is super awesome
[857.84 → 860.52] I mean the fact that it was so expensive
[860.52 → 862.16] To add to the motherboard
[862.16 → 866.30] Meant that it only existed on these super high-end products
[866.30 → 869.02] And so you were stuck with it just being like
[869.02 → 870.66] Niche-tactic
[870.66 → 873.74] For people who are willing to invest a bunch of money into a premium board
[873.74 → 877.30] And in many cases buy an additional add-on module
[877.30 → 879.98] And in terms of lowering cost
[879.98 → 880.76] This is like
[880.76 → 881.94] Not better
[881.94 → 883.32] But like better in certain ways
[883.32 → 884.22] Um
[884.22 → 885.32] Next year
[885.32 → 887.68] They are making the Thunderbolt protocol specification
[887.68 → 889.36] Available to third party chipmakers
[889.36 → 890.20] Royalty free
[890.20 → 890.78] Oh
[890.78 → 894.72] You know what's hilarious about this
[894.72 → 896.84] Is I had spent
[896.84 → 898.46] So much time
[898.46 → 899.92] Talking about
[899.92 → 901.40] Thunderbolt 3
[901.40 → 902.28] As
[902.28 → 903.06] Like
[903.06 → 905.30] One of the few key differentiators
[905.30 → 906.30] Differentiators
[906.30 → 907.66] That I could think of
[907.66 → 908.30] Between
[908.30 → 910.00] Buying Intel
[910.00 → 911.10] And buying AMD
[911.10 → 913.12] Now that Ry zen exists
[913.12 → 914.12] Because
[914.12 → 917.42] Whether you have a specific use for it
[917.42 → 918.18] Today
[918.18 → 919.64] Or not
[919.64 → 922.22] It's a really cool technology
[922.22 → 924.42] And having the expandability
[924.42 → 925.92] Of a Thunderbolt 3 port
[925.92 → 927.12] On any device
[927.12 → 929.78] Is not something that I would say no to
[929.78 → 930.74] You never
[930.74 → 931.76] Know
[931.76 → 933.96] How things are going to go down
[933.96 → 934.92] For example
[934.92 → 936.72] I'm working on a test bench right now
[936.72 → 938.46] That's got dual graphics cards
[938.46 → 940.12] A 10 gigabit NIC
[940.12 → 941.62] And a Red Rocket X
[941.62 → 942.90] Accelerator in it
[942.90 → 945.70] It has 6 PCI Express slots
[945.70 → 947.20] If I wanted to put
[947.20 → 948.66] Anything else in there
[948.66 → 949.46] You know what
[949.46 → 949.78] Hey
[949.78 → 951.98] Being able to connect it via Thunderbolt
[951.98 → 952.12] Yeah
[952.12 → 953.54] Like let's say I had like
[953.54 → 955.86] A professional audio capture device
[955.86 → 956.44] Or
[956.44 → 957.42] Something
[957.42 → 958.00] Yeah
[958.00 → 959.32] A nice high speed
[959.32 → 960.14] Low latency
[960.14 → 961.34] Daisy chainable interface
[961.34 → 962.62] I'm not going to say no to that
[962.62 → 964.58] And the same thing goes for laptops
[964.58 → 966.44] A lot of people don't think
[966.44 → 967.94] Thunderbolt 3 is that big of a deal
[967.94 → 968.64] Make yourself
[968.64 → 970.16] Yeah
[970.16 → 972.58] Sorry
[972.58 → 973.20] That was
[973.20 → 973.82] That was
[973.82 → 975.04] Very disappointing
[975.04 → 975.28] Okay
[975.28 → 976.60] We will talk about that after
[976.60 → 976.70] Yeah
[976.70 → 978.36] But a lot of people don't think
[978.36 → 979.12] Thunderbolt 3
[979.12 → 981.06] Is that big of a deal
[981.06 → 981.86] On a laptop
[981.86 → 983.02] But I'm looking at it going
[983.02 → 984.34] You're not thinking
[984.34 → 985.74] Three years out
[985.74 → 986.50] When
[986.50 → 987.48] Some new
[987.48 → 988.06] You know
[988.06 → 989.50] Hot ship
[989.50 → 990.64] Thing happens
[990.64 → 991.50] And you want to be able
[991.50 → 992.12] To connect it
[992.12 → 992.86] The other thing
[992.86 → 993.70] You're not thinking about
[993.70 → 994.34] Is that while
[994.34 → 995.64] External graphics
[995.64 → 996.44] Enclosures
[996.44 → 997.66] Don't make a ton of sense
[997.66 → 998.24] Right now
[998.24 → 999.38] While the
[999.38 → 1000.62] The cheap ones
[1000.62 → 1002.14] Use proprietary interfaces
[1002.14 → 1003.42] Like the Alienware
[1003.42 → 1004.06] Graphics
[1004.06 → 1005.02] Graphics booster
[1005.02 → 1005.70] Whatever they call it
[1005.70 → 1005.86] Anyway
[1005.86 → 1006.40] I think it's boost
[1006.40 → 1007.42] It performed really
[1007.42 → 1007.84] Really well
[1007.84 → 1008.24] In our test
[1008.24 → 1009.00] Graphics amplifier
[1009.00 → 1011.08] Like the Alienware
[1011.08 → 1011.84] So that one's like
[1011.84 → 1012.40] 200 bucks
[1012.40 → 1013.36] But the Racer core
[1013.36 → 1013.66] Is like
[1013.66 → 1015.20] 400 or 500
[1015.20 → 1016.34] Something like that
[1016.34 → 1016.96] Okay
[1016.96 → 1018.46] That won't be true forever
[1018.46 → 1019.94] There are already
[1019.94 → 1020.98] Cheaper ones
[1020.98 → 1021.94] On the market
[1021.94 → 1022.64] And that's only
[1022.64 → 1023.18] Going to continue
[1023.18 → 1023.66] To happen
[1023.66 → 1024.74] So three years
[1024.74 → 1025.22] Down the line
[1025.22 → 1025.90] So people look at it
[1025.90 → 1026.10] And they go
[1026.10 → 1026.34] What
[1026.34 → 1027.42] You're going to spend
[1027.42 → 1029.06] $1,500 on a laptop
[1029.06 → 1030.48] Another $500
[1030.48 → 1031.50] On an enclosure
[1031.50 → 1032.48] And another $500
[1032.48 → 1033.60] On a graphics card
[1033.60 → 1033.80] That
[1033.80 → 1035.38] On any graphics card
[1035.38 → 1035.84] That would actually
[1035.84 → 1036.50] Be faster than
[1036.50 → 1037.08] What's in your laptop
[1037.08 → 1038.42] No of course not
[1038.42 → 1039.28] You're going to spend
[1039.28 → 1040.62] $1,500 on a laptop
[1040.62 → 1041.60] Use the GPU
[1041.60 → 1042.32] That's in there
[1042.32 → 1043.46] And then three years
[1043.46 → 1044.14] Down the line
[1044.14 → 1044.92] Instead of spending
[1044.92 → 1045.64] Another $1,500
[1045.64 → 1046.58] On a laptop
[1046.58 → 1047.70] So that you can
[1047.70 → 1048.32] Game
[1048.32 → 1049.32] You're going to spend
[1049.32 → 1050.86] 200 bucks
[1050.86 → 1052.60] Or 150 bucks
[1052.60 → 1053.48] On an enclosure
[1053.48 → 1054.48] And by then
[1054.48 → 1055.50] Graphics technology
[1055.50 → 1056.58] Will be such
[1056.58 → 1057.22] That you could spend
[1057.22 → 1058.14] 150 bucks
[1058.14 → 1058.94] On a graphics card
[1058.94 → 1059.42] And it'll be better
[1059.42 → 1060.20] Than what's in your laptop
[1060.20 → 1062.36] That is the point
[1062.36 → 1064.00] That people are missing
[1064.00 → 1065.10] With Thunderbolt 3
[1065.10 → 1065.96] So having it
[1065.96 → 1067.12] Is a total bonus
[1067.12 → 1068.22] And for me
[1068.22 → 1069.20] So AMD announced
[1069.20 → 1069.78] That they're going to be
[1069.78 → 1070.36] Doing mobile
[1070.36 → 1071.92] Zen based CPUs soon
[1071.92 → 1073.12] That to me
[1073.12 → 1074.02] Was going to be
[1074.02 → 1074.98] A real bummer
[1074.98 → 1075.88] For investing
[1075.88 → 1077.34] In an AMD laptop
[1077.34 → 1078.10] But now
[1078.10 → 1079.18] This potentially
[1079.18 → 1080.50] Changes everything
[1080.50 → 1081.58] So let's talk about
[1081.58 → 1082.28] Let's talk about
[1082.28 → 1083.24] Microsoft not thinking
[1083.24 → 1083.82] Thunderbolt 3
[1083.82 → 1084.32] Is a big deal
[1084.32 → 1085.06] Yeah
[1085.06 → 1086.10] So they
[1086.10 → 1086.74] They brought us
[1086.74 → 1087.32] To China
[1087.32 → 1088.08] Which was super
[1088.08 → 1088.48] Interesting
[1088.48 → 1091.96] And we figured out
[1091.96 → 1092.66] What's coming out
[1092.66 → 1093.72] And I'm pretty excited
[1093.72 → 1094.46] Because Linus
[1094.46 → 1095.60] Had actually
[1095.60 → 1096.60] Oddly
[1096.60 → 1097.64] Very recently
[1097.64 → 1098.72] Made a video
[1098.72 → 1099.78] About the
[1099.78 → 1100.96] Surface Pro 4
[1100.96 → 1102.68] Which was weird
[1102.68 → 1103.40] Because it was
[1103.40 → 1105.00] A super late video
[1105.00 → 1106.14] It was like
[1106.14 → 1106.98] Wildly late
[1106.98 → 1107.48] Like this video
[1107.48 → 1108.54] Came out two months ago
[1108.54 → 1108.92] I think
[1108.92 → 1110.06] So his opinions
[1110.06 → 1111.38] On it were very fresh
[1111.38 → 1112.74] And lots of comments
[1112.74 → 1113.22] Under the video
[1113.22 → 1114.12] Were very fresh
[1114.12 → 1114.86] In terms of like
[1114.86 → 1115.72] There's a new product
[1115.72 → 1116.28] Coming out
[1116.28 → 1118.20] So I have like
[1118.20 → 1118.86] Everything ready
[1118.86 → 1119.52] I'm like okay
[1119.52 → 1120.10] Alright
[1120.10 → 1121.44] I've been told by them
[1121.44 → 1121.94] That like they've
[1121.94 → 1122.72] Directly addressed
[1122.72 → 1123.52] Claims and stuff
[1123.52 → 1123.80] And I'm like
[1123.80 → 1124.86] Man this is really exciting
[1124.86 → 1125.90] I like feel like
[1125.90 → 1126.78] I know what's coming
[1126.78 → 1128.08] And I feel like
[1128.08 → 1129.06] Like one of the quotes
[1129.06 → 1129.40] That you said
[1129.40 → 1130.92] In the Surface Pro 4 video
[1130.92 → 1132.52] Was that you feel like
[1132.52 → 1133.46] The Surface Pro 4
[1133.46 → 1134.44] Was the first time
[1134.44 → 1136.14] That the Surface Pro
[1136.14 → 1137.14] Lined up with
[1137.14 → 1138.00] Microsoft's vision
[1138.00 → 1138.54] For what it was
[1138.54 → 1139.16] Supposed to be
[1139.16 → 1139.38] Yep
[1139.38 → 1140.28] So I was like
[1140.28 → 1140.84] Here we go
[1140.84 → 1141.50] One of my lines
[1141.50 → 1142.28] Was literally like
[1142.28 → 1143.14] And this is where
[1143.14 → 1144.14] They take it from there
[1144.14 → 1144.74] And I was like
[1144.74 → 1145.96] All freaking excited
[1145.96 → 1146.88] And then
[1146.88 → 1148.82] Linus' biggest complaints
[1148.82 → 1149.48] In my opinion
[1149.48 → 1150.26] That happened
[1150.26 → 1151.04] In that video
[1151.04 → 1152.34] Were all I.O. based
[1152.34 → 1154.02] There was a micro SD card slot
[1154.02 → 1155.38] Instead of a full SD card slot
[1155.38 → 1156.38] That didn't change
[1156.38 → 1157.54] There's still a micro SD
[1157.54 → 1161.14] I think it's SDXC card slot
[1161.14 → 1162.70] And then the I.O.
[1163.10 → 1164.34] Was microphone
[1164.34 → 1165.66] Power
[1165.66 → 1167.50] The Surface dock
[1167.50 → 1169.08] The connector into the keyboard
[1169.08 → 1170.24] Mini DP
[1170.24 → 1173.78] And a USB 3 type A port
[1173.78 → 1175.02] That's all it was before
[1175.02 → 1176.40] And that is exactly
[1176.40 → 1177.10] What it is now
[1177.10 → 1177.80] The reason I remember
[1177.80 → 1178.46] Is because I just made
[1178.46 → 1179.60] A freaking video about it
[1179.60 → 1182.74] No type C
[1182.74 → 1184.34] No additional type A
[1184.34 → 1185.14] If you want to plug in
[1185.14 → 1186.76] Like a mouse
[1186.76 → 1187.48] And a flash drive
[1187.48 → 1188.14] At the same time
[1188.14 → 1189.08] You're boned
[1189.08 → 1192.06] Just I don't know
[1192.06 → 1192.46] Yeah
[1192.46 → 1194.28] And then the pen
[1194.28 → 1195.60] Isn't included in it anymore
[1195.60 → 1197.54] The pen is so much better now
[1197.54 → 1198.84] Which is super cool
[1198.84 → 1199.46] But the pen is actually
[1199.46 → 1200.96] Like drastically better now
[1200.96 → 1201.22] Right
[1201.22 → 1201.92] And you could
[1201.92 → 1203.44] That's another interesting thing
[1203.44 → 1205.12] You could just buy the pen
[1205.12 → 1206.06] Because it's backwards compatible
[1206.06 → 1207.36] And use it with your Pro 4
[1207.36 → 1210.04] And that's probably
[1210.04 → 1211.00] What a lot of people
[1211.00 → 1212.00] Are going to do
[1212.00 → 1212.28] Yeah
[1212.28 → 1213.28] Like
[1213.28 → 1214.96] Because the pen is
[1214.96 → 1215.32] What
[1215.32 → 1215.92] It's like
[1215.92 → 1217.80] Four times as precise
[1217.80 → 1220.50] It now has tilt functionality
[1220.50 → 1223.38] And latency is way lower
[1223.38 → 1224.44] It's the lowest latency
[1224.44 → 1225.70] Input pen
[1225.70 → 1226.54] That there is
[1226.54 → 1226.96] Like
[1226.96 → 1228.78] Pen's super cool
[1228.78 → 1230.42] There you go
[1230.42 → 1232.18] Did it join the
[1232.18 → 1233.54] Does it have like
[1233.54 → 1234.90] 15 new things about it
[1234.90 → 1235.50] That are better than
[1235.50 → 1236.12] Any other pen
[1236.12 → 1239.64] I wish
[1239.64 → 1240.34] Can we call it
[1240.34 → 1241.04] The pen 15
[1241.04 → 1242.82] I would love that
[1242.82 → 1243.48] I would love that
[1243.48 → 1244.86] If they just didn't acknowledge it at all
[1244.86 → 1245.48] A straight face
[1245.48 → 1247.42] Here are 15 things about the Microsoft pen
[1247.42 → 1248.06] That are the best
[1248.06 → 1248.54] I feel like
[1248.54 → 1249.42] You know how
[1249.42 → 1251.04] Musk wanted to line up
[1251.04 → 1251.98] The S
[1251.98 → 1252.70] And the 3
[1252.70 → 1253.40] And the X
[1253.40 → 1253.82] Yeah
[1253.82 → 1254.58] I feel like he
[1254.58 → 1255.76] If he released a pen
[1255.76 → 1257.20] Well no
[1257.20 → 1258.16] He wanted it to be E
[1258.16 → 1259.20] And Ford
[1259.20 → 1260.12] Screwed him on it
[1260.12 → 1261.14] That's why we
[1261.14 → 1262.62] That's why we ended up
[1262.62 → 1263.42] With S3X
[1263.42 → 1264.12] He wasn't even going to be
[1264.12 → 1264.92] That subtle man
[1264.92 → 1265.72] Model E
[1265.72 → 1266.34] And then they said
[1266.34 → 1267.30] It was too close to Model T
[1267.30 → 1267.66] Or whatever
[1267.66 → 1268.48] Which is ridiculous
[1268.48 → 1269.22] Well didn't
[1269.22 → 1270.70] No I thought they had a Model E
[1270.70 → 1272.64] I thought that was the problem
[1272.64 → 1274.10] I'm not much of a car guy
[1274.10 → 1275.42] So it's hard for me to
[1275.42 → 1277.90] To necessarily remember this stuff
[1277.90 → 1279.74] Is there a Ford
[1279.74 → 1280.14] Yeah they do
[1280.14 → 1280.70] Ford Model E
[1280.70 → 1281.50] Yeah there you go
[1281.50 → 1282.26] So that's why
[1282.26 → 1283.34] That's why they wouldn't let him
[1283.34 → 1284.04] Get away with it
[1284.04 → 1285.40] But that's okay
[1285.40 → 1285.88] You know
[1285.88 → 1287.32] Smart guy like Musk
[1287.32 → 1288.52] He can figure out
[1288.52 → 1289.24] How to get around that
[1289.24 → 1290.34] Use some leets speak
[1290.34 → 1290.92] Why not
[1290.92 → 1292.88] Speaking of smart guys like Musk
[1292.88 → 1293.94] How stoked do you think
[1293.94 → 1294.78] He is on this
[1294.78 → 1295.90] The original article here
[1295.90 → 1298.12] Is from futurism.com
[1298.12 → 1300.14] And this is some
[1300.14 → 1300.96] Skynet
[1300.96 → 1301.78] So creepy
[1301.78 → 1302.60] Ship
[1302.60 → 1304.48] Right about now you guys
[1304.48 → 1305.00] I'm going to get this
[1305.00 → 1305.84] In Twitch chat real quick
[1305.84 → 1309.02] This is some crazy business
[1309.02 → 1311.04] The headline is
[1311.04 → 1313.24] Google's new AI
[1313.24 → 1316.50] Is better at creating AI
[1316.50 → 1318.80] Than the company's engineers
[1318.80 → 1319.44] Oh that was
[1319.44 → 1320.34] I linked the wrong thing
[1320.34 → 1320.80] In Twitch chat
[1320.80 → 1321.52] This is the
[1321.52 → 1323.58] Auto ML project
[1323.58 → 1325.46] An artificial intelligence
[1325.46 → 1327.16] That assists in the creation
[1327.16 → 1328.96] Of other AIs
[1328.96 → 1330.08] This is
[1330.08 → 1331.48] Exactly
[1331.48 → 1334.12] What Terminator told us
[1334.12 → 1335.20] Not
[1335.20 → 1336.34] To do
[1336.34 → 1337.24] Exactly
[1337.24 → 1338.48] Exactly
[1338.48 → 1344.32] Yeah
[1344.32 → 1346.20] Like to a T
[1346.20 → 1348.34] So
[1348.34 → 1349.36] An auto ML
[1349.36 → 1351.06] Is a controller
[1351.06 → 1352.22] Neural net
[1352.22 → 1353.50] That can propose
[1353.50 → 1355.30] A child model architecture
[1355.30 → 1357.12] Which can then be trained
[1357.12 → 1357.86] And evaluated
[1357.86 → 1358.72] For quality
[1358.72 → 1360.06] On a particular task
[1360.06 → 1361.26] Wow
[1361.26 → 1362.36] So, so far
[1362.36 → 1363.40] They've used
[1363.40 → 1365.16] This auto ML tech
[1365.16 → 1366.58] To design networks
[1366.58 → 1367.26] For image
[1367.26 → 1368.60] And speech recognition
[1368.60 → 1369.28] Tasks
[1369.28 → 1370.58] So the system
[1370.58 → 1371.42] Matched
[1371.42 → 1372.56] Google's experts
[1372.56 → 1373.60] For image recognition
[1373.60 → 1375.46] And exceeded them
[1375.46 → 1376.74] In speech recognition
[1376.74 → 1377.68] Designing
[1377.68 → 1379.20] Better architectures
[1379.20 → 1380.14] Than the humans
[1380.14 → 1381.24] Were able to create
[1381.24 → 1382.12] This is one thing
[1382.12 → 1382.98] That I'm interested in though
[1382.98 → 1383.50] Was that
[1383.50 → 1384.42] Ever
[1384.42 → 1386.90] Or were they put
[1386.90 → 1388.00] In like a time window
[1388.00 → 1389.10] Like were the humans
[1389.10 → 1389.68] And the AI
[1389.68 → 1390.74] Both given an hour
[1390.74 → 1392.28] Or a day
[1392.28 → 1393.90] Or was it like
[1393.90 → 1394.40] What the humans
[1394.40 → 1395.00] Have been able to make
[1395.00 → 1395.74] Up until now
[1395.74 → 1396.36] To be honest
[1396.36 → 1397.06] I haven't looked
[1397.06 → 1397.82] Much further
[1397.82 → 1399.12] Into it than that
[1399.12 → 1399.94] I haven't seen
[1399.94 → 1400.70] That information
[1400.70 → 1401.34] Kind of anywhere
[1401.34 → 1402.10] Because that's actually
[1402.10 → 1403.20] A pretty interesting difference
[1403.20 → 1403.90] Right
[1403.90 → 1405.32] There were a couple
[1405.32 → 1406.16] More quotes on it
[1406.16 → 1406.82] I can have a look
[1406.82 → 1407.58] And see if I can
[1407.58 → 1408.78] Find anything about that
[1408.78 → 1409.22] Because I'm not
[1409.22 → 1409.98] I'm not trying to say
[1409.98 → 1410.58] That it wouldn't be
[1410.58 → 1411.40] Possible ever
[1411.40 → 1412.30] For them to do it
[1412.30 → 1413.12] But I feel like
[1413.12 → 1413.58] Right now
[1413.58 → 1414.38] It would be on like
[1414.38 → 1416.64] A similar timed test
[1416.64 → 1418.94] I don't think so
[1418.94 → 1420.12] It really doesn't
[1420.12 → 1420.90] Sound that way
[1420.90 → 1421.44] Because like
[1421.44 → 1422.26] Did they
[1422.26 → 1423.22] Because we're saying
[1423.22 → 1423.98] Speech recognition
[1423.98 → 1424.32] Right
[1424.32 → 1424.58] Yeah
[1424.58 → 1425.44] So did this AI
[1425.44 → 1426.10] Make a better
[1426.10 → 1426.82] Speech recognition
[1426.82 → 1427.58] Thing than what
[1427.58 → 1428.46] Google is using
[1428.46 → 1429.58] Currently right now
[1429.58 → 1430.62] Because if not
[1430.62 → 1432.12] Then it didn't
[1432.12 → 1432.58] Beat it
[1432.58 → 1433.02] I don't approve
[1433.02 → 1433.70] It's proposals
[1433.70 → 1436.38] It's worded in a way
[1436.38 → 1437.46] That I can't like
[1437.46 → 1438.64] 100% be certain
[1438.64 → 1440.28] It is a little bit
[1440.28 → 1441.16] Tough to tell
[1441.16 → 1441.98] Exactly
[1441.98 → 1443.56] Exactly what they mean
[1443.56 → 1444.52] But either way
[1444.52 → 1445.34] It sounds
[1445.34 → 1446.82] It sounds terrifying
[1446.82 → 1448.12] So basically
[1448.12 → 1449.04] Here's the quote
[1449.04 → 1450.08] If we succeed
[1450.08 → 1451.46] We think this can
[1451.46 → 1453.06] Inspire new types
[1453.06 → 1453.84] Of neural nets
[1453.84 → 1455.08] And make it possible
[1455.08 → 1456.38] For non-experts
[1456.38 → 1457.40] To create neural nets
[1457.40 → 1458.10] Tailored to their
[1458.10 → 1459.12] Particular needs
[1459.12 → 1460.58] Allowing machine learning
[1460.58 → 1462.10] To have a greater impact
[1462.10 → 1463.04] For everyone
[1463.04 → 1464.48] Oh I'm sure
[1464.48 → 1465.06] Machine learning
[1465.06 → 1465.54] Is going to have
[1465.54 → 1466.06] An impact
[1466.06 → 1467.66] Yep
[1467.66 → 1471.52] I like
[1471.52 → 1472.14] You know
[1472.14 → 1472.68] It's funny
[1472.68 → 1473.50] I was never really
[1473.50 → 1474.54] Much of a Doctor Who guy
[1474.54 → 1475.80] And then
[1475.80 → 1476.88] I like
[1476.88 → 1477.76] Binge watched
[1477.76 → 1478.94] The entire
[1478.94 → 1480.08] Like
[1480.08 → 1481.26] Like 20
[1481.26 → 1481.72] Whatever
[1481.72 → 1482.34] Doctor Who
[1482.34 → 1482.92] Like not
[1482.92 → 1483.94] Not 20th century
[1483.94 → 1484.44] Doctor Who
[1484.44 → 1485.58] The 20 year
[1485.58 → 1485.98] Something
[1485.98 → 1486.50] Doctor Who
[1486.50 → 1487.96] And I was just like
[1487.96 → 1489.82] This is great
[1489.82 → 1490.56] I think I must be
[1490.56 → 1491.72] One of the few people
[1491.72 → 1492.82] Who really liked
[1492.82 → 1493.86] The first Doctor
[1493.86 → 1494.64] From
[1494.64 → 1496.10] From the reboot
[1496.10 → 1496.78] New generation
[1496.78 → 1497.04] Yeah
[1497.04 → 1497.84] I don't even remember
[1497.84 → 1498.58] His name anymore
[1498.58 → 1499.82] But I thought he was
[1499.82 → 1500.56] I actually thought
[1500.56 → 1501.34] He was pretty awesome
[1501.34 → 1502.20] But anyway
[1502.20 → 1503.12] That's neither here
[1503.12 → 1503.46] Nor there
[1503.46 → 1504.66] But it makes me think
[1504.66 → 1505.38] Of the episode
[1505.38 → 1506.46] Where the cars
[1506.46 → 1507.58] Like drive people
[1507.58 → 1508.44] Off into the
[1508.44 → 1509.24] Into the water
[1509.24 → 1510.14] And stuff like that
[1510.14 → 1511.72] Because they're
[1511.72 → 1512.44] They're using
[1512.44 → 1513.88] They're taking over
[1513.88 → 1514.68] The world's
[1514.68 → 1515.70] Electronic devices
[1515.70 → 1516.46] And all that kind of thing
[1516.46 → 1516.96] Like I just
[1516.96 → 1520.12] I'm going to be
[1520.12 → 1520.76] Someone in chat
[1520.76 → 1521.68] In all capital letters
[1521.68 → 1522.56] The first Doctor
[1522.56 → 1523.20] Was awful
[1523.20 → 1525.94] He was not
[1525.94 → 1526.74] Awful
[1526.74 → 1528.68] Remember too though
[1528.68 → 1529.90] That I'm coming at it
[1529.90 → 1530.74] From a really different
[1530.74 → 1531.36] Perspective
[1531.36 → 1532.20] As someone who
[1532.20 → 1533.00] Never watched
[1533.00 → 1533.66] The old show
[1533.66 → 1534.52] And basically
[1534.52 → 1535.48] Other than knowing
[1535.48 → 1536.14] That it was something
[1536.14 → 1537.40] To do with a blue phone booth
[1537.40 → 1538.06] Yeah
[1538.06 → 1540.14] Knew nothing about it
[1540.14 → 1541.16] I know there's a blue phone booth
[1541.16 → 1542.60] I know there's a crazy screwdriver
[1542.60 → 1543.02] And I know
[1543.02 → 1543.68] Wait you haven't watched
[1543.68 → 1544.20] Doctor Who?
[1544.32 → 1544.60] No
[1544.60 → 1546.44] I think he like
[1546.44 → 1547.44] Dies sometimes
[1547.44 → 1548.18] And then he like
[1548.18 → 1548.84] Glows and then
[1548.84 → 1549.86] Another one shows up
[1549.86 → 1552.96] Or does he like
[1552.96 → 1554.34] Like pass the screwdriver
[1554.34 → 1554.80] Forward
[1554.80 → 1556.56] Is it a different screwdriver?
[1557.84 → 1559.38] Is it a sonic screwdriver?
[1561.46 → 1561.94] No?
[1563.64 → 1564.12] No?
[1565.12 → 1566.34] Okay I'm sad now
[1566.34 → 1566.58] Okay
[1566.58 → 1568.14] You have to watch
[1568.14 → 1569.06] Some Doctor Who bro
[1569.06 → 1569.36] Okay
[1569.36 → 1570.18] It's actually
[1570.18 → 1571.48] Okay it's really camp
[1571.48 → 1572.10] But it's like
[1572.10 → 1572.96] Actually perfect
[1572.96 → 1573.68] It's perfect
[1573.68 → 1574.22] You'll like it
[1574.22 → 1574.78] You'll like it
[1574.78 → 1574.98] Alright
[1574.98 → 1576.98] Alright let's
[1576.98 → 1581.66] That's all I know about
[1581.66 → 1582.22] The only
[1582.22 → 1582.54] You know
[1582.54 → 1583.06] It's funny
[1583.06 → 1583.52] I'm like
[1583.52 → 1584.16] I'm leaning on you
[1584.16 → 1584.56] Really hard
[1584.56 → 1585.38] Even though I went
[1585.38 → 1585.90] So long
[1585.90 → 1586.78] Without watching it
[1586.78 → 1587.40] But the reason
[1587.40 → 1587.94] I'm doing it
[1587.94 → 1588.80] Is that's what
[1588.80 → 1589.36] Made me
[1589.36 → 1590.18] Finally go
[1590.18 → 1590.50] Okay
[1590.50 → 1591.08] Okay
[1591.08 → 1592.32] Like Firefly
[1592.32 → 1592.70] I was like
[1592.70 → 1592.96] Okay
[1592.96 → 1593.56] Fine
[1593.56 → 1594.08] Fine
[1594.08 → 1594.62] Fine
[1594.62 → 1595.18] I'll watch it
[1595.18 → 1595.40] Okay
[1595.40 → 1596.24] I'll watch it
[1596.24 → 1597.58] Because like
[1597.58 → 1597.80] Honestly
[1597.80 → 1598.98] Nerd fandoms go that way
[1598.98 → 1600.10] It's terrifying
[1600.10 → 1601.20] Tackling
[1601.20 → 1602.46] Like Firefly was okay
[1602.46 → 1603.68] Because there's only one season
[1603.68 → 1604.66] But like
[1604.66 → 1605.50] When someone comes to you
[1605.50 → 1605.80] And they're like
[1605.80 → 1607.04] This is a really great show
[1607.04 → 1608.32] There's nine
[1608.32 → 1609.26] Freaking
[1609.26 → 1609.72] You know
[1609.72 → 1610.88] Twenty episode seasons
[1610.88 → 1611.44] And I think it's still going
[1611.44 → 1611.72] Right
[1611.72 → 1613.44] And you're just like
[1613.44 → 1616.82] This is like
[1616.82 → 1617.86] A week of my life
[1617.86 → 1618.78] That I'm committing to this
[1618.78 → 1619.36] If I like it
[1619.36 → 1619.80] And see like
[1619.80 → 1620.68] Usually I wait
[1620.68 → 1621.58] Until shows are over
[1621.58 → 1623.72] I still haven't watched
[1623.72 → 1624.64] Any Game of Thrones
[1624.64 → 1625.40] Me neither
[1625.40 → 1626.12] Because I'm waiting
[1626.12 → 1627.04] For it to end
[1627.04 → 1630.00] Okay
[1630.00 → 1630.68] I think I watched
[1630.68 → 1631.50] Like the first season
[1631.50 → 1632.40] But I don't really remember
[1632.40 → 1633.74] Well I read the first book
[1633.74 → 1634.22] Yeah
[1634.22 → 1635.32] Found out they weren't all written
[1635.32 → 1636.14] And I was like
[1636.14 → 1637.32] Flip desk
[1637.32 → 1639.08] Nope
[1639.08 → 1640.38] I own them all
[1640.38 → 1640.80] On like
[1640.80 → 1640.94] Kindle
[1640.94 → 1642.22] I didn't know there were books
[1642.22 → 1644.04] Usually I read the book first
[1644.04 → 1644.32] Right
[1644.32 → 1645.08] I ended up watching
[1645.08 → 1645.70] A couple episodes
[1645.70 → 1646.10] And I was like
[1646.10 → 1647.36] Damn this show's
[1647.36 → 1648.24] Weird as hell
[1648.24 → 1649.08] But pretty good
[1649.08 → 1649.94] So I ended up watching
[1649.94 → 1650.66] The whole first season
[1650.66 → 1651.08] Then I was like
[1651.08 → 1651.92] I'll wait
[1651.92 → 1653.08] Until all the seasons are done
[1653.08 → 1653.54] And then I figured out
[1653.54 → 1653.96] There were books
[1653.96 → 1654.84] And I bought the books
[1654.84 → 1655.74] And then was like
[1655.74 → 1656.34] Oh my goodness
[1656.34 → 1657.28] There are more books coming
[1657.28 → 1657.86] Damn it
[1657.86 → 1659.70] So we've gone through
[1659.70 → 1660.96] Exactly the same
[1660.96 → 1662.44] I've actually gone
[1662.44 → 1663.28] One step further
[1663.28 → 1664.64] I already own the Blu-rays
[1664.64 → 1665.96] For like the first five seasons
[1665.96 → 1668.66] Well HMV
[1668.66 → 1670.14] H&M
[1670.14 → 1671.36] HMV
[1671.36 → 1672.22] HMV
[1672.22 → 1672.78] Disappeared
[1672.78 → 1673.54] Shut down
[1673.54 → 1674.50] And I went in
[1674.50 → 1675.08] And like
[1675.08 → 1677.06] Seasons of Game of Thrones
[1677.06 → 1677.98] Were like $14
[1677.98 → 1679.30] Or something on Blu-ray
[1679.30 → 1680.80] Like it was ridiculous
[1680.80 → 1682.02] That's perfect
[1682.02 → 1682.86] So I bought like
[1682.86 → 1684.54] $400 worth of Blu-rays
[1684.54 → 1685.10] That day
[1685.10 → 1687.00] I got so much good stuff
[1687.00 → 1687.64] That's pretty good
[1687.64 → 1688.28] And I was just like
[1688.28 → 1689.04] Yeah okay
[1689.04 → 1689.58] Well
[1689.58 → 1690.54] I
[1690.54 → 1691.86] The good news is
[1691.86 → 1693.14] I have lots of time
[1693.14 → 1694.50] To rip it all to my Plex server
[1694.50 → 1696.24] Because I won't be watching it
[1696.24 → 1697.64] For a very long time
[1697.64 → 1697.98] Yes
[1697.98 → 1698.36] Yeah
[1698.36 → 1698.84] Yeah
[1698.84 → 1700.48] Um
[1700.48 → 1701.12] All right
[1701.12 → 1701.38] What else
[1701.38 → 1702.22] Oh Google
[1702.22 → 1703.72] Has made the ultimate
[1703.72 → 1704.78] Marketing tool
[1704.78 → 1705.00] Yeah
[1705.00 → 1705.72] So this is what
[1705.72 → 1706.76] I actually thought
[1706.76 → 1708.04] We were sharing before
[1708.04 → 1710.54] The original article here
[1710.54 → 1711.48] Is from
[1711.48 → 1713.20] Bleepingcomputer.com
[1713.20 → 1714.28] And it'll come up eventually
[1714.28 → 1715.76] Way to go
[1715.76 → 1716.50] Bleepingcomputer.com
[1716.50 → 1717.10] So this is
[1717.10 → 1717.30] Yeah
[1717.30 → 1717.76] This is
[1717.76 → 1718.16] Oh
[1718.16 → 1719.82] I timed it just wrong
[1719.82 → 1720.24] It finally came up
[1720.24 → 1721.10] This is super creepy
[1721.10 → 1722.98] The last one was like
[1722.98 → 1723.62] Oh my god
[1723.62 → 1724.98] They're going to take over the world
[1724.98 → 1726.02] That's terrifying
[1726.02 → 1726.88] This one's like
[1726.88 → 1728.70] Oh my god
[1728.70 → 1730.36] This is the creepiest thing
[1730.36 → 1730.96] Freaking ever
[1730.96 → 1733.08] What the actual hell is this
[1733.08 → 1734.00] Yeah
[1734.00 → 1734.94] At the annual
[1734.94 → 1737.02] Google Marketing Next conference
[1737.02 → 1738.22] The Mountain View search
[1738.22 → 1739.30] And advertising giant
[1739.30 → 1740.26] Announced a new service
[1740.26 → 1741.74] That will let advertisers
[1741.74 → 1742.64] Track
[1742.64 → 1744.10] And tie
[1744.10 → 1746.42] Offline credit card payments
[1746.42 → 1749.06] With ongoing marketing campaigns
[1749.06 → 1752.10] So this is going to be
[1752.10 → 1753.26] This system will be driven
[1753.26 → 1754.42] By machine learning
[1754.42 → 1756.34] And combines data
[1756.34 → 1758.00] From Google's regular campaigns
[1758.00 → 1759.44] With third party partnerships
[1759.44 → 1761.40] Which capture 70%
[1761.40 → 1762.28] Of credit
[1762.28 → 1763.48] And debit
[1763.48 → 1764.68] Transactions
[1764.68 → 1765.74] In the US
[1765.74 → 1766.94] Yeah
[1766.94 → 1768.14] This is terrible
[1768.14 → 1768.78] Yeah
[1768.78 → 1770.26] The good news
[1770.26 → 1770.84] Is that
[1770.84 → 1771.60] And they use like
[1771.60 → 1773.32] Geolocation and everything
[1773.32 → 1774.60] To tie in
[1774.60 → 1775.28] Everything
[1775.28 → 1776.26] So like
[1776.26 → 1777.96] They'll find
[1777.96 → 1779.10] Mood patterns
[1779.10 → 1780.42] Where like
[1780.42 → 1781.50] If something is happening
[1781.50 → 1783.02] Like say your phone
[1783.02 → 1783.84] Is blowing up
[1783.84 → 1785.10] From certain contacts
[1785.10 → 1786.96] And you tend to make
[1786.96 → 1788.40] Certain impulse purchases
[1788.40 → 1789.48] When certain people
[1789.48 → 1790.60] Are blowing up your phone
[1790.60 → 1791.60] They'll like
[1791.60 → 1792.92] I'm not even kidding though
[1792.92 → 1793.42] Flowers
[1793.42 → 1794.08] Yeah
[1794.08 → 1794.64] Yeah
[1794.64 → 1795.74] They'll throw advertisements
[1795.74 → 1796.38] At you
[1796.38 → 1798.20] For different services
[1798.20 → 1798.84] And what not
[1798.84 → 1799.94] And of course
[1799.94 → 1800.78] They're analyzing
[1800.78 → 1802.32] Exactly what's being said
[1802.32 → 1802.58] Even
[1802.58 → 1804.00] So they don't even have to
[1804.00 → 1805.12] Look for it to blow up
[1805.12 → 1807.04] They could just look for
[1807.04 → 1808.16] They could know before
[1808.16 → 1808.62] You know
[1808.62 → 1809.54] And then have those ads
[1809.54 → 1809.86] Ready for you
[1809.86 → 1811.52] Our anniversary is coming up
[1811.52 → 1812.42] And boom
[1812.42 → 1813.82] Sky helicopters ads
[1813.82 → 1814.96] Actually
[1814.96 → 1816.38] They'll know your
[1816.38 → 1818.02] Like target price
[1818.02 → 1818.70] Probably too
[1818.70 → 1820.48] From your payment history
[1820.48 → 1822.06] So they'll give you like
[1822.06 → 1824.14] A value appropriate ad
[1824.14 → 1826.18] I mean at what point
[1826.18 → 1827.62] Do we just live in capsules
[1827.62 → 1828.38] Like the matrix
[1828.38 → 1830.26] And we just get like
[1830.26 → 1831.24] When we want it
[1831.24 → 1831.82] We get like
[1831.82 → 1833.00] An injection of happiness
[1833.00 → 1833.82] And when we
[1833.82 → 1835.12] Want it
[1835.12 → 1835.74] We get like
[1835.74 → 1836.44] Some food
[1836.44 → 1837.28] Into our
[1837.28 → 1839.36] You know what's hilarious
[1839.36 → 1840.10] Is I'm probably
[1840.10 → 1841.32] And I'm
[1841.32 → 1841.96] I'm just gonna
[1841.96 → 1842.94] Kind of jump in here
[1842.94 → 1843.58] And you can correct me
[1843.58 → 1843.98] If I'm wrong
[1843.98 → 1844.78] I'm probably the most
[1844.78 → 1845.94] Fidgety person you know
[1845.94 → 1848.30] Yeah
[1848.30 → 1849.62] And I'm really fidgety too
[1849.62 → 1850.40] But that's not
[1850.40 → 1850.98] I don't even know
[1850.98 → 1851.78] Why they're called that
[1851.78 → 1853.00] I have never been
[1853.00 → 1853.90] Even tempted
[1853.90 → 1855.24] To try a fidget spinner
[1855.24 → 1856.46] No because it's too
[1856.46 → 1857.26] It's too
[1857.26 → 1859.62] Like basic
[1859.62 → 1860.28] One dimensional
[1860.28 → 1860.80] I don't get it
[1860.80 → 1861.22] Like I
[1861.22 → 1862.72] Like I fidget with
[1862.72 → 1863.78] Whatever's in front of me
[1863.78 → 1864.36] I like
[1864.36 → 1865.76] Like I used to drive
[1865.76 → 1866.60] Nick light
[1866.60 → 1867.76] Freaking
[1867.76 → 1869.22] Crazy
[1869.22 → 1870.76] On our conference calls
[1870.76 → 1872.48] Because we used to do them
[1872.48 → 1873.74] In the WAN showroom
[1873.74 → 1874.32] Back when we were
[1874.32 → 1875.34] At the old Langley place
[1875.34 → 1876.82] And there was a boom arm
[1876.82 → 1878.18] That had the microphone
[1878.18 → 1879.04] For the show
[1879.04 → 1880.38] Above where we'd sit
[1880.38 → 1880.80] On the couch
[1880.80 → 1881.92] Because that was the couch
[1881.92 → 1882.62] We'd sit on the couch
[1882.62 → 1883.44] And we'd do our conference calls
[1883.44 → 1883.66] Together
[1883.66 → 1885.36] And so whatever was in my hand
[1885.36 → 1886.82] I would put my arm out
[1886.82 → 1888.04] And I would throw it
[1888.04 → 1889.52] Up over the pole to myself
[1889.52 → 1890.50] I remember that
[1890.50 → 1891.32] And catch it
[1891.32 → 1892.16] To myself
[1892.16 → 1893.14] And I would like
[1893.14 → 1894.24] Hit the boom arm
[1894.24 → 1894.96] From time to time
[1894.96 → 1895.54] And people who were
[1895.54 → 1896.20] On the call with us
[1896.20 → 1896.72] Would be like
[1896.72 → 1897.68] Oh it's
[1897.68 → 1898.26] What sorry
[1898.26 → 1899.28] Did you guys
[1899.28 → 1900.00] Cut out for a second
[1900.00 → 1901.56] And Nick would be just like
[1901.56 → 1905.94] But yeah
[1905.94 → 1907.40] I just don't get
[1907.40 → 1908.82] A fidget spinner thing
[1908.82 → 1909.58] But the thing is
[1909.58 → 1910.60] You're fidgeting
[1910.60 → 1911.82] And like I think
[1911.82 → 1912.78] We have similar kinds
[1912.78 → 1914.24] You'll like grab something
[1914.24 → 1915.34] And like throw it around
[1915.34 → 1915.90] And you're like
[1915.90 → 1916.56] Really interactive
[1916.56 → 1916.94] Like
[1916.94 → 1920.12] This is too boring
[1920.12 → 1921.58] There's not enough going on
[1921.58 → 1922.52] That doesn't really
[1922.52 → 1923.94] It's way too boring
[1923.94 → 1924.64] With that said
[1924.64 → 1925.34] Have you tried one?
[1925.98 → 1926.32] No
[1926.32 → 1927.12] Okay so maybe
[1927.12 → 1928.54] Before we dismiss it
[1928.54 → 1928.82] I know
[1928.82 → 1929.08] Yeah
[1929.08 → 1929.76] We should at least
[1929.76 → 1930.16] You know
[1930.16 → 1931.22] If you're going to say
[1931.22 → 1931.56] I don't want to buy
[1931.56 → 1932.32] One of those stupid things
[1932.32 → 1933.16] If you're going to say
[1933.16 → 1934.66] Crack cocaine is bad
[1934.66 → 1936.18] You should at least
[1936.18 → 1937.02] Try it first
[1937.02 → 1940.06] Okay
[1940.06 → 1940.98] Just so like
[1940.98 → 1942.00] It's on record
[1942.00 → 1943.40] No obviously not
[1943.40 → 1944.92] No obviously not
[1944.92 → 1945.48] But that won't
[1945.48 → 1946.30] Change the gifts
[1946.30 → 1946.72] Yeah
[1946.72 → 1948.40] Anyway back to the
[1948.40 → 1949.26] Marketing next
[1949.26 → 1950.62] Google attribution
[1950.62 → 1951.32] So that's what the
[1951.32 → 1952.22] Service is going to be called
[1952.22 → 1952.44] Yeah
[1952.44 → 1955.62] It aggregates details
[1955.62 → 1956.22] About the ads
[1956.22 → 1957.20] Displayed on your phone
[1957.20 → 1958.10] The sites
[1958.10 → 1958.96] And time
[1958.96 → 1959.90] That you visited them
[1959.90 → 1960.58] What you've searched
[1960.58 → 1961.06] In Google
[1961.06 → 1962.08] It uses geolocation
[1962.08 → 1963.14] And Wi-Fi information
[1963.14 → 1963.82] From your phone
[1963.82 → 1965.32] To tell if you've
[1965.32 → 1966.02] Gone to the mall
[1966.02 → 1967.28] Or walked into a store
[1967.28 → 1968.20] That sells that product
[1968.20 → 1968.74] And finally
[1968.74 → 1969.58] With the integration
[1969.58 → 1970.34] Of payment data
[1970.34 → 1971.40] From third party partnerships
[1971.40 → 1972.04] Google will know
[1972.04 → 1973.30] If you've bought that product
[1973.30 → 1974.56] And will report it
[1974.56 → 1975.62] In the advertisers
[1975.62 → 1976.28] Google Ads
[1976.28 → 1977.20] Dashboard
[1977.20 → 1979.12] It's driven by machine learning
[1979.12 → 1979.98] And combines data
[1979.98 → 1980.30] From
[1980.30 → 1981.12] Okay we already said
[1981.12 → 1981.50] That part
[1981.50 → 1983.28] Holy freaking crap
[1983.28 → 1984.36] With that said
[1984.36 → 1985.66] If Google knew
[1985.66 → 1986.54] That my wife's birthday
[1986.54 → 1987.20] Was coming up
[1987.20 → 1988.84] And suggested sky helicopters
[1988.84 → 1990.06] That would be pretty cool
[1990.06 → 1990.84] We finally went
[1990.84 → 1991.78] On our helicopter ride
[1991.78 → 1992.52] Oh cool
[1992.52 → 1993.84] Yeah so I bought it for her
[1993.84 → 1995.14] Back in October
[1995.14 → 1995.76] It's been a bit
[1995.76 → 1997.18] Which is when her birthday is
[1997.18 → 1997.90] And I didn't have to think
[1997.90 → 1998.78] About that for a sec
[1998.78 → 2003.28] And it took until now
[2003.28 → 2003.96] For us to do it
[2003.96 → 2004.58] Because we've had
[2004.58 → 2006.08] A very, very young baby
[2006.08 → 2007.52] And it was kind of like
[2007.52 → 2009.28] The reason for the timing
[2009.28 → 2010.60] The reason for the gift
[2010.60 → 2011.50] The reason for giving her
[2011.50 → 2012.28] A gift that I knew
[2012.28 → 2012.92] She wouldn't be able
[2012.92 → 2013.90] To enjoy for a bit
[2013.90 → 2015.00] Was it was like
[2015.00 → 2016.68] Hey hon
[2016.68 → 2018.70] Everything is horrible
[2018.70 → 2019.36] Right now
[2019.36 → 2020.46] Because we have an infant
[2020.46 → 2022.36] But here's something
[2022.36 → 2023.96] To really look forward to
[2023.96 → 2024.64] Yeah that's cool
[2024.64 → 2025.16] Once we can leave
[2025.16 → 2025.88] The baby at home
[2025.88 → 2026.80] For a couple of hours
[2026.80 → 2026.96] Yeah
[2026.96 → 2028.68] And so we went
[2028.68 → 2029.70] We went flying
[2029.70 → 2031.26] Up into the mountains
[2031.26 → 2034.00] Just north of
[2034.00 → 2034.72] The greater
[2034.72 → 2036.30] The greater Vancouver area
[2036.30 → 2036.74] Okay yeah
[2036.74 → 2038.02] And these pictures
[2038.02 → 2039.80] Are freaking sick
[2039.80 → 2041.16] So it's actually
[2041.16 → 2042.34] My sister's boyfriend
[2042.34 → 2043.48] Who took us up there
[2043.48 → 2045.26] And so he's a
[2045.26 → 2046.34] He's a helicopter pilot
[2046.34 → 2048.64] And he even got us
[2048.64 → 2049.62] Like a small deal
[2049.62 → 2052.18] And freaking man
[2052.18 → 2053.62] We did the sunset
[2053.62 → 2055.98] We did the sunset tour
[2055.98 → 2056.00] You guys aren't going to be able
[2056.00 → 2056.40] To see this
[2056.40 → 2057.16] Yeah sorry you guys
[2057.16 → 2058.04] Won't be able to see this
[2058.04 → 2059.52] Wow that's really cool
[2059.52 → 2059.82] But like
[2059.82 → 2061.04] It's like freaking wilderness
[2061.04 → 2062.14] Hold on
[2062.14 → 2063.14] Oh I'm going backwards
[2063.14 → 2064.22] No I'm getting to like
[2064.22 → 2065.42] Just flying over like the city
[2065.42 → 2066.64] That's not as good
[2066.64 → 2067.50] Oh you guys got out
[2067.50 → 2068.36] But we got like
[2068.36 → 2069.30] Way
[2069.30 → 2069.84] Oh yeah yeah
[2069.84 → 2071.48] We land on a mountaintop
[2071.48 → 2072.42] That's really cool
[2072.42 → 2074.12] And you can just see
[2074.12 → 2075.74] As far as the eye can see
[2075.74 → 2077.24] The entire top of the mountain
[2077.24 → 2077.90] Wow that's awesome
[2077.90 → 2078.62] Is just like
[2078.62 → 2079.48] Like it's
[2079.48 → 2080.94] It's like a jagged peak
[2080.94 → 2081.48] But it's like
[2081.48 → 2082.66] Flattened out from the
[2082.66 → 2083.68] From the cone of snow
[2083.68 → 2084.32] On the top
[2084.32 → 2085.30] And like
[2085.30 → 2086.82] You're like on top of the world
[2086.82 → 2088.20] And uh
[2088.20 → 2089.54] As the sun goes down
[2089.54 → 2090.34] The light was just
[2090.34 → 2091.80] Like we got the perfect light
[2091.80 → 2091.98] That's wild
[2091.98 → 2093.50] So the sun coming through
[2093.50 → 2094.82] Kind of light cloud
[2094.82 → 2095.98] On us
[2095.98 → 2097.68] But blue skies above us
[2097.68 → 2099.18] And uh
[2099.18 → 2100.62] It was just
[2100.62 → 2101.42] Oh that one's blurry
[2101.42 → 2102.72] It was just unreal
[2102.72 → 2104.18] Middle of nowhere
[2104.18 → 2105.30] This would be like
[2105.30 → 2106.12] A three
[2106.12 → 2107.68] Four day expedition
[2107.68 → 2109.62] For a very experienced
[2109.62 → 2110.16] Mountaineer
[2110.16 → 2110.62] Yeah
[2110.62 → 2111.52] Or you can fly up there
[2111.52 → 2112.62] In like 20 minutes
[2112.62 → 2113.68] Um
[2113.68 → 2115.72] That's pretty awesome
[2115.72 → 2116.06] But uh
[2116.06 → 2116.54] Let me just see
[2116.54 → 2117.68] If I can find like
[2117.68 → 2118.72] One of the pictures
[2118.72 → 2119.38] We took like
[2119.38 → 2120.56] Right when the sun was
[2120.56 → 2121.40] Sun was setting
[2121.40 → 2122.22] It's like
[2122.22 → 2123.54] Freaking unbelievable
[2123.54 → 2124.74] It's like so quiet
[2124.74 → 2126.28] Just crazy
[2126.28 → 2127.28] Got like the helicopter
[2127.28 → 2128.28] In the background there
[2128.28 → 2129.24] That's really cool
[2129.24 → 2130.28] It was really expensive
[2130.28 → 2131.14] Like it was still
[2131.14 → 2132.40] Like 500 bucks
[2132.40 → 2134.04] So it's not the kind of present
[2134.04 → 2135.64] That I would buy every year
[2135.64 → 2136.52] Or anything like that
[2136.52 → 2136.86] Yeah
[2136.86 → 2137.80] But again
[2137.80 → 2138.70] Like you know me
[2138.70 → 2139.62] I'm the kind of person
[2139.62 → 2140.46] Who does like a
[2140.46 → 2142.28] A big gift once in a while
[2142.28 → 2143.14] And then like
[2143.14 → 2144.76] Here's some
[2144.76 → 2145.56] You know
[2145.56 → 2146.78] Breakfast or whatever
[2146.78 → 2147.08] Finger
[2147.08 → 2147.48] Yeah
[2147.48 → 2148.10] Like more like
[2148.10 → 2148.88] More like a gesture
[2148.88 → 2150.28] And I think in that case
[2150.28 → 2151.20] It sort of makes sense
[2151.20 → 2152.58] Like this sucks right now
[2152.58 → 2153.30] But here like
[2153.30 → 2154.12] Just look at this
[2154.12 → 2154.80] Don't worry about it
[2154.80 → 2155.40] Let's keep going
[2155.40 → 2155.74] Yeah
[2155.74 → 2156.58] It was like to get
[2156.58 → 2157.76] It was as much for me
[2157.76 → 2158.54] As it was for her
[2158.54 → 2159.58] To get both of us
[2159.58 → 2160.04] Through the
[2160.04 → 2162.52] Through the next six months
[2162.52 → 2164.22] Speaking of getting
[2164.22 → 2165.36] Through the next six months
[2165.36 → 2167.00] You know
[2167.00 → 2167.80] We have to make sure
[2167.80 → 2169.16] We keep the lights on
[2169.16 → 2170.04] In the studio
[2170.04 → 2171.16] For the next six months
[2171.16 → 2172.16] So
[2172.16 → 2174.22] Sponsors for the WAN show today
[2174.22 → 2175.38] You know what's funny
[2175.38 → 2175.88] Is
[2175.88 → 2178.32] I actually didn't know this
[2178.32 → 2179.24] Until
[2179.24 → 2182.14] Until when I was working
[2182.14 → 2184.14] On Pimp My Wi-Fi
[2184.14 → 2185.62] Out in Singapore
[2185.62 → 2187.54] That Genius
[2187.54 → 2188.76] In addition to making
[2188.76 → 2189.98] Consumer grade stuff
[2189.98 → 2191.22] Actually makes
[2191.22 → 2192.44] Enterprise class
[2192.44 → 2193.22] Networking gear
[2193.22 → 2196.08] So this right here
[2196.08 → 2197.82] Is the EWS 360 AP
[2197.82 → 2199.06] It's an enterprise class
[2199.06 → 2200.28] Dual band access point
[2200.28 → 2201.54] Ideal for large offices
[2201.54 → 2202.38] Schools
[2202.38 → 2204.18] And hospitality guest
[2204.18 → 2204.98] Wi-Fi access
[2204.98 → 2206.92] It features 11 AC speeds
[2206.92 → 2208.74] And it's got a bunch
[2208.74 → 2209.84] Of business class features
[2209.84 → 2211.12] It can operate in autonomous
[2211.12 → 2212.40] Or managed mode
[2212.40 → 2213.70] It's got a high-powered radio
[2213.70 → 2215.46] With a 3x3 antenna design
[2215.46 → 2218.02] And it's got meshing technology
[2218.02 → 2219.00] Built in
[2219.00 → 2219.52] So that means
[2219.52 → 2220.80] You can actually run
[2220.80 → 2222.24] And obviously
[2222.24 → 2222.88] It's not as good
[2222.88 → 2223.48] As running a wire
[2223.48 → 2224.42] To every single AP
[2224.42 → 2225.92] We know
[2225.92 → 2226.80] But sometimes
[2226.80 → 2227.88] You don't really
[2227.88 → 2228.76] Have a choice
[2228.76 → 2229.30] And a mesh
[2229.30 → 2230.12] Can be very
[2230.12 → 2230.78] Very convenient
[2230.78 → 2232.42] There are
[2232.42 → 2233.46] So this is where
[2233.46 → 2235.34] They really kill it
[2235.34 → 2235.90] In terms of the
[2235.90 → 2236.86] Total cost of ownership
[2236.86 → 2238.24] Unlike some other
[2238.24 → 2239.58] Enterprise access points
[2239.58 → 2241.02] There are no
[2241.02 → 2242.52] Per device
[2242.52 → 2243.70] License fees
[2243.70 → 2244.90] And no annual
[2244.90 → 2245.92] Subscription fees
[2245.92 → 2247.52] So that's what keeps
[2247.52 → 2248.62] So while the AP
[2248.62 → 2249.78] Itself might not be
[2249.78 → 2250.52] That cheap
[2250.52 → 2251.56] Compared to another
[2251.56 → 2252.26] Access point
[2252.26 → 2253.28] That's not really
[2253.28 → 2253.92] The point
[2253.92 → 2256.96] The point is
[2256.96 → 2257.74] Lower overall
[2257.74 → 2259.10] Total cost of ownership
[2259.10 → 2259.84] So check it over
[2259.84 → 2260.74] Check it out

[2264.88 → 2265.50] T
[2265.50 → 2266.00] M
[2266.00 → 2266.80] L
[2266.80 → 2268.62] Also sponsoring
[2268.62 → 2269.30] The show
[2269.30 → 2270.02] This week
[2270.02 → 2271.00] Mack Weldon
[2271.00 → 2273.18] You look so sharp
[2273.18 → 2274.00] When you wear a collar
[2274.00 → 2274.70] I think
[2274.70 → 2275.86] Other than
[2275.86 → 2276.70] The first year
[2276.70 → 2277.42] At CES
[2277.42 → 2278.22] Where you wore like
[2278.22 → 2278.74] Where you like
[2278.74 → 2279.26] Bought
[2279.26 → 2280.58] You like
[2280.58 → 2281.24] You did it
[2281.24 → 2282.66] The way that like
[2282.66 → 2283.36] Noobs
[2283.36 → 2284.74] Buy clothes
[2284.74 → 2286.06] Where you bought
[2286.06 → 2287.22] An outfit
[2287.22 → 2287.68] Yep
[2287.68 → 2288.64] Like
[2288.64 → 2289.30] A shirt
[2289.30 → 2290.80] A vest
[2290.80 → 2292.26] A pants
[2292.26 → 2295.20] And
[2295.20 → 2295.94] Anyway
[2295.94 → 2296.92] I think that's like
[2296.92 → 2297.94] One of the few times
[2297.94 → 2299.20] I've ever seen you dress up
[2299.20 → 2301.18] The collar suits you though
[2301.18 → 2302.16] There was also
[2302.16 → 2302.88] Computer
[2302.88 → 2303.02] Wait
[2303.02 → 2304.12] Did you say Computer
[2304.12 → 2305.18] Oh Computer too
[2305.18 → 2305.84] That same year
[2305.84 → 2306.10] Yeah
[2306.10 → 2307.30] So Mack Weldon
[2307.30 → 2308.68] Believes in smart design
[2308.68 → 2309.52] Premium fabrics
[2309.52 → 2310.96] And simple shopping
[2310.96 → 2312.30] Even he could do it
[2312.30 → 2316.34] That's like actually like
[2316.34 → 2317.82] They make super comfortable
[2317.82 → 2318.38] Underwear
[2318.38 → 2318.80] Socks
[2318.80 → 2319.18] Shirts
[2319.18 → 2319.94] Undershirts
[2319.94 → 2320.44] Hoodies
[2320.44 → 2321.86] And sweatpants
[2321.86 → 2323.98] And they have a line of silver
[2323.98 → 2325.16] Underwear and shirts
[2325.16 → 2327.24] That are naturally antimicrobial
[2327.24 → 2327.84] Which
[2327.84 → 2329.82] And this is a really fun fact
[2329.82 → 2331.68] Is actually a thing
[2331.68 → 2334.18] You can put silver in your water cooling loop
[2334.18 → 2336.78] And it will kill bacterial growth
[2336.78 → 2338.32] Silver ions
[2338.32 → 2339.48] That's a thing
[2339.48 → 2341.54] So when they lace these fabrics
[2341.54 → 2342.62] With silver
[2342.62 → 2345.58] They actually naturally kill the microbes
[2345.58 → 2346.64] That cause BO
[2346.64 → 2348.26] You're still going to sweat obviously
[2348.26 → 2350.08] But hey
[2350.08 → 2352.18] At least it helps
[2352.18 → 2354.08] And like you should still wash it out
[2354.08 → 2354.74] And stuff
[2354.74 → 2355.56] Yes
[2355.56 → 2357.22] Mack Weldon
[2357.22 → 2358.12] The only clothing
[2358.12 → 2359.80] You never have to wash
[2359.80 → 2361.28] You heard it here first
[2361.28 → 2363.22] It was a complete and utter lie
[2363.22 → 2364.58] But that's
[2364.58 → 2365.64] But you heard it here first
[2365.64 → 2366.66] Anyway
[2366.66 → 2368.20] Mack Weldon wants you to be comfortable
[2368.20 → 2370.60] So if you don't like your first pair of boxers
[2370.60 → 2371.72] You can keep it
[2371.72 → 2373.30] And they will still refund you
[2373.30 → 2375.32] And not only do their underwear
[2375.32 → 2376.40] Socks and shirts look good
[2376.40 → 2377.86] They perform well
[2377.86 → 2379.72] Great for working out
[2379.72 → 2380.50] Going to work
[2380.50 → 2381.32] Going on dates
[2381.32 → 2382.60] And just everyday life
[2382.60 → 2382.90] I mean
[2382.90 → 2383.72] Basically
[2383.72 → 2384.98] Good clothes
[2384.98 → 2385.68] Should be good
[2385.68 → 2386.78] For everyday life

[2440.46 → 2442.16] So there will be like a whole kit
[2442.16 → 2444.10] So it's going to be halfway tech
[2444.10 → 2446.38] Like we're going to have some partners coming out
[2446.38 → 2448.04] And like taking it up
[2448.04 → 2450.84] Like game at 144 hertz in 4k
[2450.84 → 2451.52] Cool
[2451.52 → 2452.00] I think
[2452.00 → 2453.60] I think those guys are coming out
[2453.60 → 2455.48] And then we're going to have stuff that's just like
[2455.48 → 2456.62] Completely carnival
[2456.62 → 2457.04] Like we're
[2457.04 → 2459.28] You know those things with the big long bungee cord
[2459.28 → 2461.52] Where you like to run as fast as you can
[2461.52 → 2462.92] As hard as you can
[2462.92 → 2463.82] Against the bungee cord
[2463.82 → 2465.16] And then it like rips you back
[2465.16 → 2465.90] Oh god
[2465.90 → 2468.10] So we're going to get one of those I think
[2468.10 → 2468.36] Nice
[2468.36 → 2471.12] So we're just going to have just a mishmash of like stupid
[2471.12 → 2471.92] I will do that one
[2471.92 → 2473.04] Fun crap to do
[2473.04 → 2474.76] And you come hang out with the LTT crew
[2474.76 → 2475.80] Tickets are 30 bucks
[2475.80 → 2478.22] Or there's a bigger package that includes
[2478.22 → 2480.20] Float plane membership and some other cool stuff
[2480.20 → 2480.48] So
[2480.48 → 2481.54] There you go
[2481.54 → 2483.06] LTX is coming
[2483.06 → 2486.04] Alright
[2486.04 → 2487.40] Other news topics
[2487.40 → 2488.54] What else we got here
[2488.54 → 2489.48] Oh yes
[2489.48 → 2490.20] Leaks
[2490.20 → 2491.06] So
[2491.06 → 2492.60] SciSoftware.net
[2492.60 → 2494.68] Is the original source for the leak here
[2494.68 → 2497.62] And it looks like a gigabyte board
[2497.62 → 2502.96] Running an Intel Core i7 7900X 10 core CPU
[2502.96 → 2504.28] At 4 gigahertz base
[2504.28 → 2505.84] 4.5 boost
[2505.84 → 2508.16] Was leaked AF
[2508.16 → 2510.14] So that is the
[2510.14 → 2513.04] Local rank number 2
[2513.04 → 2513.26] Okay
[2513.26 → 2515.32] A lot of these numbers don't mean a lot to me
[2515.32 → 2516.08] But that's okay
[2516.08 → 2518.72] 20 threads
[2518.72 → 2519.84] 4 gigahertz
[2519.84 → 2520.42] Wow
[2520.42 → 2523.78] If that is the actual TDP rating
[2523.78 → 2526.20] That is basically Intel
[2526.20 → 2528.24] Turning up the heat
[2528.24 → 2529.26] Quite literally
[2529.26 → 2531.24] Like they have been so conservative
[2531.24 → 2533.88] In the stock speeds of their processors
[2533.88 → 2535.12] For so long
[2535.12 → 2537.62] If this 175 watt TDP
[2537.62 → 2538.46] Is for real
[2538.46 → 2540.22] You are going to need
[2540.22 → 2541.66] Like a dual
[2541.66 → 2543.68] 120 millimetre liquid cooler
[2543.68 → 2546.20] In order to keep this thing boosting up
[2546.20 → 2546.82] Which is cool
[2546.82 → 2548.08] Which is great
[2548.08 → 2549.70] For those of you on like
[2549.70 → 2550.82] SoundCloud
[2550.82 → 2552.80] Listening to the podcast
[2552.80 → 2553.36] Which
[2553.36 → 2554.50] Almost no one does
[2554.50 → 2555.92] Because we never mentioned that it exists
[2555.92 → 2557.78] It's 175 watts
[2557.78 → 2561.94] Why are you plugging the audio version?
[2562.80 → 2563.94] Nobody cares
[2563.94 → 2564.94] Nobody cares
[2564.94 → 2566.54] I think it's on iTunes too
[2566.54 → 2567.06] Is it?
[2567.22 → 2567.54] Yeah
[2567.54 → 2570.44] I think Colton set up like an automated thing
[2570.44 → 2571.76] People ask me every once in a while
[2571.76 → 2573.76] Like when are you guys going to make it like a legit podcast
[2573.76 → 2575.40] And like to go on like iTunes and stuff
[2575.40 → 2575.76] And I'm like
[2575.76 → 2577.92] I don't even know if we are or not right now
[2577.92 → 2579.14] Hey
[2579.14 → 2580.96] We might already be
[2580.96 → 2581.14] Hey
[2581.14 → 2583.74] The WAN show is a legit podcast
[2583.74 → 2585.46] I think they mean like audio podcast
[2585.46 → 2586.24] Well
[2586.24 → 2587.10] You know what?
[2587.48 → 2588.64] Oh jeez
[2588.64 → 2589.30] There it is
[2589.30 → 2590.32] Look at that
[2590.32 → 2590.92] It is on iTunes
[2590.92 → 2591.50] iTunes
[2591.50 → 2593.38] Uh there's uh
[2593.38 → 2594.04] Oh okay
[2594.04 → 2595.24] That one didn't go up until
[2595.24 → 2596.86] Like mid this week
[2596.86 → 2598.18] But you can still
[2598.18 → 2599.96] You can still listen to it on iTunes
[2599.96 → 2601.12] So it's like
[2601.12 → 2602.82] We cold news
[2602.82 → 2604.02] Four days late
[2604.02 → 2605.14] Okay
[2605.14 → 2606.08] We should maybe
[2606.08 → 2607.06] Maybe it's not automated
[2607.06 → 2608.10] It's probably not automated
[2608.10 → 2609.44] Colton probably is doing it manually
[2609.44 → 2610.18] Wow
[2610.18 → 2612.88] Which I appreciate his dedication
[2612.88 → 2614.74] But uh there you go
[2614.74 → 2615.00] Yeah
[2615.00 → 2616.08] The WAN show is on iTunes
[2616.08 → 2617.12] Now you know
[2617.12 → 2619.02] It's a free download on iTunes
[2619.02 → 2619.42] I
[2619.42 → 2620.98] Can you see how many people like
[2620.98 → 2622.38] I have no idea
[2622.38 → 2623.44] Customer reviews
[2623.44 → 2623.94] Okay
[2623.94 → 2624.92] Hey let's read these
[2624.92 → 2625.66] Let's read some reviews
[2625.66 → 2627.22] Great guys
[2627.22 → 2628.52] I've been watching their content
[2628.52 → 2630.22] Ever since they started making tech videos
[2630.22 → 2631.10] On the internet there buddy
[2631.10 → 2633.30] Glad to see them make the jump to iTunes as well
[2633.30 → 2634.14] Very informative
[2634.14 → 2635.78] And well done tech and news coverage
[2635.78 → 2636.94] That Canadian accent
[2636.94 → 2637.54] Damn
[2637.54 → 2638.82] Really nice
[2638.82 → 2640.26] Really glad to see the WAN show
[2640.26 → 2641.36] Make its way to YouTube buddy
[2641.36 → 2642.00] It's two guys
[2642.00 → 2642.44] Having fun
[2642.44 → 2643.82] Laughing at the silly state of the world
[2643.82 → 2644.84] Focus on technology
[2644.84 → 2645.66] Love to support them
[2645.66 → 2646.62] As they Canadian boys
[2646.62 → 2647.90] Okay that one legitimately
[2647.90 → 2649.18] Sounded like a Canadian rodent
[2649.18 → 2650.10] It did too right
[2650.10 → 2650.40] Yeah
[2650.40 → 2650.74] Yeah
[2650.74 → 2652.60] Good to see this make its way
[2652.60 → 2653.32] To the iTunes
[2653.32 → 2653.90] Good idea
[2653.90 → 2654.58] So you can listen to it
[2654.58 → 2655.48] Whenever you want there buddy
[2655.48 → 2656.44] Great job guys
[2656.44 → 2657.32] Keep up the good work
[2657.32 → 2658.64] Where you want there buddy
[2658.64 → 2659.82] Laughing
[2659.82 → 2661.00] If that legitimately said buddy
[2661.00 → 2661.84] That would have been perfect
[2661.84 → 2663.56] I wish it said buddy
[2663.56 → 2664.04] Yeah
[2664.04 → 2665.02] But that one
[2665.02 → 2665.66] That second one
[2665.66 → 2666.14] That did say
[2666.14 → 2667.32] As they Canadian boys
[2667.32 → 2668.48] And it sounded Canadian
[2668.48 → 2669.56] Before it said that
[2669.56 → 2669.66] Yep
[2669.66 → 2669.98] Yep
[2669.98 → 2671.46] So that was pretty good
[2671.46 → 2673.18] So there you go
[2673.18 → 2674.42] If you ever left a review
[2674.42 → 2676.24] I think that's all three
[2676.24 → 2678.12] If you ever left a review
[2678.12 → 2680.38] Of the WAN show on iTunes
[2680.38 → 2684.06] Then you got a hardcore WAN show call out
[2684.06 → 2684.38] Yep
[2684.38 → 2684.90] There you go
[2684.90 → 2685.30] Um
[2685.30 → 2686.44] Uh
[2686.44 → 2687.28] T Moody
[2687.28 → 2688.42] Demon Hunter
[2688.42 → 2690.18] And YOLO Swag Shop
[2690.18 → 2693.72] Yes
[2693.72 → 2695.38] And there are four numbers after it
[2695.38 → 2697.66] So like YOLO Swag Shop was taken
[2697.66 → 2700.14] And now it's YOLO Swag Shop 1275
[2700.14 → 2701.10] You know
[2701.10 → 2703.38] I excuse it these days
[2703.38 → 2703.52] So good
[2703.52 → 2704.50] But I remember
[2704.50 → 2706.92] When like email addresses
[2706.92 → 2707.34] Yeah
[2707.34 → 2710.14] Were easy enough to get
[2710.14 → 2710.74] Unique ones
[2710.74 → 2711.72] Were easy enough to get
[2711.72 → 2712.50] That like
[2712.50 → 2714.76] When I met my wife
[2714.76 → 2717.16] I legitimately
[2717.16 → 2718.72] Straight up
[2718.72 → 2720.08] Held it against her
[2720.08 → 2722.52] That her email address
[2722.52 → 2723.44] At the time
[2723.44 → 2725.22] Was Sweetheart09
[2725.22 → 2727.06] At something
[2727.06 → 2728.96] And I was just like
[2728.96 → 2730.60] Really
[2730.60 → 2733.68] I don't know if
[2733.68 → 2734.46] I don't know if
[2734.46 → 2736.18] This relationship's going to be a thing
[2736.18 → 2737.58] In my girlfriend's defence
[2737.58 → 2739.26] She has a Gmail now
[2739.26 → 2740.22] Okay
[2740.22 → 2742.66] She got off the Yahoo train
[2742.66 → 2743.38] Finally
[2743.38 → 2744.66] Oh well she wasn't at Yahoo
[2744.66 → 2745.66] So
[2745.66 → 2746.78] Yeah
[2746.78 → 2747.90] Was not at Yahoo
[2747.90 → 2748.62] She was at like
[2748.62 → 2750.62] A real email provider
[2750.62 → 2751.08] Yeah
[2751.08 → 2751.96] Yeah so
[2751.96 → 2753.26] Yeah
[2753.26 → 2754.72] She fixed it
[2754.72 → 2754.96] Yeah
[2754.96 → 2756.14] Sorry Emma
[2756.14 → 2756.78] But you're done
[2756.78 → 2758.64] No she fixed it
[2758.64 → 2760.64] She fixed it
[2760.64 → 2761.32] And it's fine
[2761.32 → 2763.52] What else we got
[2763.52 → 2765.90] AMD discusses
[2765.90 → 2767.38] Upcoming RAM settings
[2767.38 → 2768.38] In Ry zen
[2768.38 → 2769.72] So this was actually
[2769.72 → 2770.60] Big news
[2770.60 → 2771.68] When Ry zen
[2771.68 → 2773.16] Was first launching
[2773.16 → 2774.14] That
[2774.14 → 2775.30] There was pretty much
[2775.30 → 2777.18] Nothing to adjust
[2777.18 → 2778.74] Like you could turn
[2778.74 → 2779.58] The speed-up as high
[2779.58 → 2780.38] As you could go
[2780.38 → 2782.22] And you could tighten up
[2782.22 → 2783.36] Primary timings
[2783.36 → 2784.80] But like
[2784.80 → 2786.48] That was it
[2786.48 → 2788.18] Now
[2788.18 → 2790.32] They are opening things up
[2790.32 → 2791.18] A fair bit more
[2791.18 → 2791.74] So there's actually
[2791.74 → 2792.68] Some really great news here
[2792.68 → 2793.68] This is community update
[2793.68 → 2794.20] Number four
[2794.20 → 2795.10] So first
[2795.10 → 2797.14] I was talking to my buddies
[2797.14 → 2798.42] Over at Lime Tech
[2798.42 → 2799.24] Unpaid
[2799.24 → 2800.00] And
[2800.00 → 2801.72] Blah blah blah blah
[2801.72 → 2802.80] FTC disclosure
[2802.80 → 2804.60] I am involved in
[2804.60 → 2805.54] Potentially investing
[2805.54 → 2806.36] In Lime Technologies
[2806.36 → 2806.66] Anyway
[2806.66 → 2808.10] So I was talking to my buds
[2808.10 → 2808.60] Over there
[2808.60 → 2809.34] And they were like
[2809.34 → 2810.44] This
[2810.44 → 2812.32] Virtualization news
[2812.32 → 2813.32] Is good news
[2813.32 → 2814.16] Because Ry zen
[2814.16 → 2815.64] Has not
[2815.64 → 2816.74] Been a lot of fun
[2816.74 → 2817.78] In Unpaid
[2817.78 → 2818.74] With virtualization
[2818.74 → 2819.60] Up till now
[2819.60 → 2820.90] So here we go
[2820.90 → 2821.64] They're getting
[2821.64 → 2822.42] Fresh support
[2822.42 → 2823.46] For PCI Express
[2823.46 → 2824.96] Access control services
[2824.96 → 2826.74] Which primarily enables
[2826.74 → 2827.96] Support for manual
[2827.96 → 2828.54] Assignment
[2828.54 → 2830.70] Of PCIe graphics cards
[2830.70 → 2831.84] Within logical containers
[2831.84 → 2833.34] Called IOM MU groups
[2833.34 → 2835.02] So the hardware resources
[2835.02 → 2835.54] Blah blah blah
[2835.54 → 2836.24] Can be dedicated
[2836.24 → 2836.92] To virtual machines
[2836.92 → 2837.44] So this
[2837.44 → 2838.92] Is for GPU pass through
[2838.92 → 2839.66] And this is what
[2839.66 → 2840.56] Projects like
[2840.56 → 2841.32] Seven gamers
[2841.32 → 2842.62] One CPU
[2842.62 → 2843.88] Have been all about
[2843.88 → 2845.32] Without ACS support
[2845.32 → 2847.72] 3D accelerated graphics
[2847.72 → 2848.22] In a VM
[2848.22 → 2848.64] Was like
[2848.64 → 2850.00] Not going to be a thing
[2850.00 → 2850.70] So
[2850.70 → 2852.20] This is freaking awesome
[2852.20 → 2852.86] That's perfect
[2852.86 → 2853.72] With ACS support
[2853.72 → 2855.28] Is also possible to split
[2855.28 → 2856.40] See they're talking about this
[2856.40 → 2857.96] A two GPU system
[2857.96 → 2858.94] Such that
[2858.94 → 2859.68] Host
[2859.68 → 2860.60] Linux OS
[2860.60 → 2861.46] And a Windows VM
[2861.46 → 2862.14] Could both have
[2862.14 → 2862.84] Dedicated graphics
[2862.84 → 2863.54] This is exactly
[2863.54 → 2864.34] What we're talking about
[2864.34 → 2865.28] It's freaking awesome
[2865.28 → 2867.70] Also what's next
[2867.70 → 2868.10] For memory
[2868.10 → 2869.16] So added dividers
[2869.16 → 2869.80] For memory clocks
[2869.80 → 2871.06] Up to DDR4 4000
[2871.06 → 2872.10] Good luck getting that running
[2872.10 → 2873.36] Command rate
[2873.36 → 2874.68] Is coming
[2874.68 → 2876.48] And a bunch
[2876.48 → 2878.18] Of secondary timings
[2878.18 → 2879.00] So there you go
[2879.00 → 2880.08] Freaking cool
[2880.08 → 2880.32] Wow
[2880.32 → 2880.96] That's really cool
[2880.96 → 2881.70] All the things
[2881.70 → 2882.58] That's a pretty huge update
[2882.58 → 2882.86] Actually
[2882.86 → 2883.52] All the freaking things
[2883.52 → 2883.88] So
[2883.88 → 2885.32] You won't get
[2885.32 → 2886.26] Any of this functionality
[2886.26 → 2887.30] Until your motherboard
[2887.30 → 2888.12] Manufacturer
[2888.12 → 2889.10] Bakes it into
[2889.10 → 2890.62] A UEFI update
[2890.62 → 2891.98] But it's good to know
[2891.98 → 2892.50] That these things
[2892.50 → 2893.30] Are being worked on
[2893.30 → 2893.76] And again
[2893.76 → 2894.80] This comes down to
[2894.80 → 2895.14] Like
[2895.14 → 2897.14] Us not necessarily
[2897.14 → 2898.16] Being that comfortable
[2898.16 → 2900.10] Saying go buy Ry zen now
[2900.10 → 2901.54] But us also having
[2901.54 → 2902.12] The confidence
[2902.12 → 2903.16] To give the
[2903.16 → 2904.34] The technology
[2904.34 → 2905.64] A positive
[2905.64 → 2906.98] A positive spin
[2906.98 → 2907.62] In our review
[2907.62 → 2909.00] Because we were sure
[2909.00 → 2910.06] That given a little bit
[2910.06 → 2910.48] Of time
[2910.48 → 2911.34] AMD was going to
[2911.34 → 2912.38] Get this stuff worked on
[2912.38 → 2913.76] So I am
[2913.76 → 2914.90] I am flipping excited
[2914.90 → 2915.58] For what they're doing
[2915.58 → 2916.32] Right now over there
[2916.32 → 2917.36] Oh wow
[2917.36 → 2918.90] Thank you, Ivan
[2918.90 → 2919.78] Yeah
[2919.78 → 2920.72] You guys may or may
[2920.72 → 2921.32] Not have noticed
[2921.32 → 2922.34] But Ivan like
[2922.34 → 2922.86] Kind of
[2922.86 → 2924.10] Is sleeping in a corner
[2924.10 → 2924.60] Of the warehouse
[2924.60 → 2925.18] Right now
[2925.18 → 2925.50] Yeah
[2925.50 → 2927.58] I don't know
[2927.58 → 2928.24] How many of you
[2928.24 → 2929.60] Will actually even
[2929.60 → 2930.70] Know who Ivan is
[2930.70 → 2931.96] But he's the
[2931.96 → 2932.40] OG
[2932.40 → 2934.14] OG crazy Russian
[2934.14 → 2935.48] Is what I used to
[2935.48 → 2936.48] Always refer to him as
[2936.48 → 2937.22] Back in the
[2937.22 → 2938.64] NCI tech tips days
[2938.64 → 2941.38] And I've been informed
[2941.38 → 2942.04] It's not Russian
[2942.04 → 2943.04] It's Soviet Canadian
[2943.04 → 2944.04] Okay
[2944.04 → 2944.48] Okay
[2944.48 → 2944.84] I got
[2944.84 → 2946.10] That's what I said
[2946.10 → 2948.30] OG crazy Russian
[2948.30 → 2948.96] Because that's what
[2948.96 → 2950.08] I called you
[2950.08 → 2950.64] Not like
[2950.64 → 2951.74] I was referring back
[2951.74 → 2952.58] To something that
[2952.58 → 2953.64] I said that was wrong
[2953.64 → 2956.34] Yeah
[2956.34 → 2958.40] You too bro
[2958.40 → 2958.98] Okay
[2958.98 → 2960.42] Anyway
[2960.42 → 2961.52] He brought us water
[2961.52 → 2963.00] He's good people
[2963.00 → 2964.90] I mean mine doesn't
[2964.90 → 2965.66] Have any ice in it
[2965.66 → 2965.86] But
[2965.86 → 2966.92] I think mine has
[2966.92 → 2967.98] Like construction stuff
[2967.98 → 2968.56] You know it's a
[2968.56 → 2969.14] It's a learning
[2969.14 → 2970.38] It's a learning experience
[2970.38 → 2971.64] Um
[2971.64 → 2973.46] What else we got
[2973.46 → 2974.68] 26 more parameters
[2974.68 → 2975.36] Blah blah blah
[2975.36 → 2976.44] Oh we're expecting
[2976.44 → 2977.16] Oh we're expecting
[2977.16 → 2978.36] These BIOSes to roll out
[2978.36 → 2979.38] Sometime in the mid
[2979.38 → 2981.28] To late June time frame
[2981.28 → 2982.42] There are apparently
[2982.42 → 2983.34] A couple boards
[2983.34 → 2984.74] That already have public betas
[2984.74 → 2987.18] The GA-AX370 Gaming 5
[2987.18 → 2987.78] From Gigabyte
[2987.78 → 2989.22] And the Crosshair 6
[2989.22 → 2990.82] From Asus
[2990.82 → 2993.32] Europe
[2993.32 → 2995.54] Modernizes media rules
[2995.54 → 2997.16] Keeps TV
[2997.16 → 2997.98] Relevant
[2997.98 → 2999.94] Um
[2999.94 → 3002.04] This is a super boring article
[3002.04 → 3002.70] So there's some weird stuff
[3002.70 → 3003.50] Apparently
[3003.50 → 3004.94] The revised directive
[3004.94 → 3005.96] Gives broadcasters
[3005.96 → 3006.64] More flexibility
[3006.64 → 3007.90] As to when ads
[3007.90 → 3008.70] Can be shown
[3008.70 → 3010.04] The overall limit
[3010.04 → 3010.86] Of 20%
[3010.86 → 3011.92] Of broadcasting time
[3011.92 → 3012.64] Is maintained
[3012.64 → 3014.06] Between 7am
[3014.06 → 3015.20] And 11pm
[3015.20 → 3015.80] But instead of
[3015.80 → 3016.92] The current 12 minutes
[3016.92 → 3017.62] Per hour
[3017.62 → 3019.14] Broadcasters can choose
[3019.14 → 3019.68] More freely
[3019.68 → 3020.42] When to show ads
[3020.42 → 3021.14] Throughout the day
[3021.14 → 3022.62] Okay so that gives them
[3022.62 → 3023.66] The ability to sell
[3023.66 → 3024.92] A lot more advertising
[3024.92 → 3025.96] During prime time
[3025.96 → 3027.42] And then kind of
[3027.42 → 3028.12] Ease off it
[3028.12 → 3028.68] When most people
[3028.68 → 3029.06] Aren't listening
[3029.06 → 3029.60] Kind of like
[3029.60 → 3030.18] What you'll see them
[3030.18 → 3030.86] Do on the radio
[3030.86 → 3032.02] Where they'll have like
[3032.02 → 3033.60] An hour of uninterrupted
[3033.60 → 3034.48] Ad free music
[3034.48 → 3035.34] When nobody's
[3035.34 → 3036.44] Freaking listening anyway
[3036.44 → 3036.86] Yeah
[3036.86 → 3037.30] Yeah
[3037.30 → 3038.48] Like really late at night
[3038.48 → 3039.92] They'll even do like
[3039.92 → 3041.34] 4 hours or something
[3041.34 → 3042.66] Like during my morning commute
[3042.66 → 3044.66] On TSN 1040
[3044.66 → 3045.76] It's the only radio station
[3045.76 → 3046.98] That I still know exists
[3046.98 → 3049.60] Like every
[3049.60 → 3050.52] Like it's like
[3050.52 → 3051.82] An 18-minute drive
[3051.82 → 3053.28] And I will get like
[3053.28 → 3055.98] At least one ad
[3055.98 → 3057.42] For where to take my
[3057.42 → 3058.18] Cummins
[3058.18 → 3058.72] Cummins
[3058.72 → 3059.66] Turbo diesel
[3059.66 → 3060.74] Yeah Cummins
[3060.74 → 3061.26] Or Cummins
[3061.26 → 3061.76] Cummins
[3061.76 → 3065.06] I think Cummins
[3065.06 → 3065.70] Is it different
[3065.70 → 3066.54] All the car people
[3066.54 → 3067.90] Are coming for me
[3067.90 → 3068.28] Oh
[3068.28 → 3069.92] Anyway
[3069.92 → 3071.54] So I can
[3071.54 → 3072.24] I know where to get
[3072.24 → 3073.22] My diesel repaired
[3073.22 → 3074.76] I know where to
[3074.76 → 3076.20] Cummins
[3076.20 → 3076.48] Cummins okay
[3076.48 → 3078.00] I know where to go
[3078.00 → 3078.66] For my
[3078.66 → 3079.94] My freight and logistics
[3079.94 → 3081.72] I know where I could
[3081.72 → 3082.60] Buy a Chrysler
[3082.60 → 3083.88] And like
[3083.88 → 3084.72] Like all this
[3084.72 → 3085.64] They get like
[3085.64 → 3086.88] So many sponsor reads
[3086.88 → 3087.80] So the reason
[3087.80 → 3088.84] Why we're saying Cummins
[3088.84 → 3089.38] And most people
[3089.38 → 3089.94] Are probably freaking
[3089.94 → 3090.42] The heck out
[3090.42 → 3091.74] Is that is a like
[3091.74 → 3093.84] Trailer and engine shop
[3093.84 → 3094.92] That's actually
[3094.92 → 3095.88] Somewhat near us
[3095.88 → 3096.64] So we've probably
[3096.64 → 3097.76] Seen their advertisements
[3097.76 → 3099.90] That's a local shop
[3099.90 → 3100.38] Okay
[3100.38 → 3101.28] It's Cummins
[3101.28 → 3102.16] Is this specific
[3102.16 → 3102.70] Yeah
[3102.70 → 3103.24] Okay
[3103.24 → 3105.58] So anyway
[3105.58 → 3106.70] What else are they doing
[3106.70 → 3108.36] Blah blah blah blah blah blah
[3108.36 → 3109.22] Platform
[3109.22 → 3110.28] The new proposed rules
[3110.28 → 3110.92] Are platforms
[3110.92 → 3111.96] Which organize and tag
[3111.96 → 3112.90] A large quantity of videos
[3112.90 → 3113.82] Will have to protect
[3113.82 → 3115.26] Minors from harmful content
[3115.26 → 3116.28] Such as pornography
[3116.28 → 3116.96] And violence
[3116.96 → 3117.92] And protect all citizens
[3117.92 → 3118.72] From incitement
[3118.72 → 3119.36] To hatred
[3119.36 → 3120.40] So this is basically
[3120.40 → 3120.94] Kind of levelling
[3120.94 → 3121.54] The playing field
[3121.54 → 3122.02] A little bit
[3122.02 → 3122.32] Like
[3122.32 → 3122.98] You know
[3122.98 → 3123.78] Let's say
[3123.78 → 3125.02] Some popular
[3125.02 → 3125.94] Cancerous
[3125.94 → 3127.52] Online personality
[3127.52 → 3129.72] That is driving
[3129.72 → 3131.10] Viewers to a platform
[3131.10 → 3132.16] TV doesn't even
[3132.16 → 3133.40] Really have the option
[3133.40 → 3134.16] To like
[3134.16 → 3134.54] Like if
[3134.54 → 3135.64] Everyone's kids
[3135.64 → 3136.60] Are attracted
[3136.60 → 3137.34] To this person
[3137.34 → 3138.42] Who swears a lot
[3138.42 → 3139.80] And spews a lot of
[3139.80 → 3140.74] A lot of hate
[3140.74 → 3141.36] And garbage
[3141.36 → 3143.76] But it's driving traffic
[3143.76 → 3144.60] And driving revenue
[3144.60 → 3145.34] To the platform
[3145.34 → 3146.24] Basically what they're
[3146.24 → 3146.62] Trying to do
[3146.62 → 3147.46] Is level the playing field
[3147.46 → 3147.78] A little bit
[3147.78 → 3148.30] They're going okay
[3148.30 → 3148.98] Look you can't
[3148.98 → 3149.82] You can't market that
[3149.82 → 3151.70] At miners
[3151.70 → 3152.22] Yeah
[3152.22 → 3152.84] Okay
[3152.84 → 3154.26] Will now ensure
[3154.26 → 3155.34] That regulatory authorities
[3155.34 → 3156.28] Are truly independent
[3156.28 → 3157.26] From government and industry
[3157.26 → 3158.26] To ensure that
[3158.26 → 3159.74] The audiovisual media act
[3159.74 → 3160.36] Is in the interest
[3160.36 → 3160.90] Of the viewers
[3160.90 → 3162.86] And they want to
[3162.86 → 3163.92] Something
[3163.92 → 3164.68] Something
[3164.68 → 3165.92] Yeah I really don't know
[3165.92 → 3166.88] If that's going to save TV
[3166.88 → 3167.66] But I wish them luck
[3167.66 → 3169.00] Yeah
[3169.00 → 3171.42] Oh good
[3171.42 → 3172.16] Wonderful
[3172.16 → 3174.46] Just when I was enjoying
[3174.46 → 3175.50] The Galaxy S8
[3175.50 → 3176.54] And it's iris scanner
[3176.54 → 3177.84] This is from
[3177.84 → 3179.34] Bleepingcomputer.com
[3179.34 → 3180.08] The Samsung
[3180.08 → 3180.74] Excuse me
[3180.74 → 3182.52] The Samsung Galaxy S8's
[3182.52 → 3183.14] Iris scanner
[3183.14 → 3183.94] Is apparently
[3183.94 → 3186.08] Easily hackable
[3186.08 → 3187.92] And fooled by a photo
[3187.92 → 3188.88] Which is funny
[3188.88 → 3190.28] Because I remember
[3190.28 → 3191.28] Specifically
[3191.28 → 3193.80] Sitting in
[3193.80 → 3195.12] A Samsung briefing
[3195.12 → 3196.32] For the Note 7
[3196.32 → 3197.38] See they promised
[3197.38 → 3198.04] All kinds of things
[3198.04 → 3198.68] About the Note 7
[3198.68 → 3199.24] They promised it
[3199.24 → 3199.70] Wouldn't explode
[3199.70 → 3200.92] Well they didn't
[3200.92 → 3201.70] Specifically promise
[3201.70 → 3202.28] It wouldn't explode
[3202.28 → 3203.06] It never came up
[3203.06 → 3204.60] But they said
[3204.60 → 3205.70] That the iris scanner
[3205.70 → 3206.56] Wasn't going to be
[3206.56 → 3207.64] Like facial recognition
[3207.64 → 3208.66] And that it wouldn't
[3208.66 → 3210.30] Be easy to fool
[3210.30 → 3212.46] But apparently
[3212.46 → 3213.64] A photo of a person's eye
[3213.64 → 3214.70] Taken at medium distance
[3214.70 → 3215.72] Is more than enough
[3215.72 → 3216.70] To trick a Samsung
[3216.70 → 3218.18] Galaxy S8 smartphone
[3218.18 → 3219.22] According to researchers
[3219.22 → 3221.56] From the Chaos Computer Group
[3221.56 → 3222.18] So they're saying
[3222.18 → 3222.78] That they used
[3222.78 → 3223.62] Depth scanning
[3223.62 → 3224.56] To try to like
[3224.56 → 3226.10] Make it more advanced
[3226.10 → 3228.04] And that whole
[3228.04 → 3229.56] Advancement was bypassed
[3230.36 → 3232.54] By gluing a contact lens
[3232.54 → 3233.84] On top of the image
[3233.84 → 3235.40] Creating a round surface
[3235.40 → 3236.34] On top
[3236.34 → 3237.72] And that successfully
[3237.72 → 3238.56] Tricked everything
[3238.56 → 3240.44] Interesting
[3240.44 → 3242.56] So
[3242.56 → 3244.44] And this is because
[3244.44 → 3245.74] Modern iris scanners
[3245.74 → 3247.30] And facial recognition systems
[3247.30 → 3248.16] Are programmed
[3248.16 → 3249.72] To use image depth
[3249.72 → 3251.04] In order to distinguish
[3251.04 → 3252.52] Between photos
[3252.52 → 3254.10] And a human
[3254.10 → 3255.38] Or like other
[3255.38 → 3256.88] Three dimensional object
[3256.88 → 3257.80] So
[3257.80 → 3259.08] I think there's a number
[3259.08 → 3259.76] Of different ways
[3259.76 → 3260.80] That you could break that
[3260.80 → 3261.18] To be honest
[3261.18 → 3261.82] Clever trick
[3261.82 → 3262.74] And this is great
[3262.74 → 3264.64] To get the best results
[3264.64 → 3265.40] With your hack
[3265.40 → 3266.46] You are going to want
[3266.46 → 3268.12] To use a Samsung printer
[3268.12 → 3270.06] Perfect
[3270.06 → 3271.78] So take photos
[3271.78 → 3272.60] Using the camera's
[3272.60 → 3273.32] Night shot mode
[3273.32 → 3274.70] As it captures iris details
[3274.70 → 3275.04] Better
[3275.04 → 3276.08] And then
[3276.08 → 3277.52] He got the best results
[3277.52 → 3278.10] With a Samsung
[3278.10 → 3279.24] Laser printer
[3279.24 → 3279.60] The thing is
[3279.60 → 3279.86] Okay
[3279.86 → 3280.80] To be fair
[3280.80 → 3281.40] That
[3281.40 → 3282.06] Out of everything
[3282.06 → 3282.66] On this article
[3282.66 → 3283.68] That seems a little
[3283.68 → 3284.50] Sensationalist
[3284.50 → 3285.50] Because he might have
[3285.50 → 3286.16] Had like
[3286.16 → 3288.44] A Junko printer
[3288.44 → 3288.90] Yes
[3288.90 → 3289.52] And then like
[3289.52 → 3290.58] The really expensive
[3290.58 → 3291.32] Samsung printer
[3291.32 → 3291.84] That he bought
[3291.84 → 3292.34] And been like
[3292.34 → 3292.94] Haha
[3292.94 → 3293.90] Guess what
[3293.90 → 3295.66] Or he had just
[3295.66 → 3296.14] Two different
[3296.14 → 3296.90] Samsung printers
[3296.90 → 3297.56] And was like
[3297.56 → 3297.88] Yeah
[3297.88 → 3299.32] My best result
[3299.32 → 3299.94] Both of them were great
[3299.94 → 3301.62] Was off the only one I had
[3301.62 → 3302.42] Thanks Samsung
[3302.42 → 3304.62] For sponsoring this article
[3304.62 → 3305.16] On the internet
[3305.16 → 3305.52] Yeah
[3305.52 → 3306.36] Not so much
[3306.36 → 3307.92] Okay
[3307.92 → 3309.70] We've got an iPhone rumour
[3309.70 → 3311.32] So why don't we move on
[3311.32 → 3312.08] To something else
[3312.08 → 3315.06] Researchers engineer
[3315.06 → 3317.28] Shape shifting noodles
[3317.28 → 3320.10] Researchers from MIT
[3320.10 → 3322.34] Engineer noodles
[3322.34 → 3323.60] That can change shape
[3323.60 → 3324.76] So these sheets of gelatin
[3324.76 → 3327.24] Transform into 3D shapes
[3327.24 → 3328.36] When dunked in water
[3328.36 → 3329.32] Which could save
[3329.32 → 3331.64] On food shipping costs
[3331.64 → 3334.52] Solving the world's problem
[3334.52 → 3336.28] One air pocket
[3336.28 → 3338.06] At a time
[3338.06 → 3338.74] Why does it need
[3338.74 → 3339.86] To change shape though
[3339.86 → 3341.34] Well because people
[3341.34 → 3342.00] Like noodles
[3342.00 → 3342.96] In different shapes
[3342.96 → 3345.10] People
[3345.10 → 3346.14] Like I like bow ties
[3346.14 → 3348.36] You know my family
[3348.36 → 3349.30] Always called them diapers
[3349.30 → 3350.38] Why
[3350.38 → 3351.58] That's gross
[3351.58 → 3352.40] Think about that
[3352.40 → 3353.32] Next time you're eating
[3353.32 → 3354.76] Pasta
[3354.76 → 3357.56] Why would you do that
[3357.56 → 3358.88] Especially if you've got
[3358.88 → 3360.44] Kind of like a really
[3360.44 → 3361.76] Chunky sauce in it
[3361.76 → 3362.72] Oh great
[3362.72 → 3363.32] Think about that
[3363.32 → 3363.86] While you eat it
[3363.86 → 3364.10] Okay
[3364.10 → 3365.44] Some like not minced
[3365.44 → 3365.76] Enough beef
[3365.76 → 3366.56] Chunky diapers
[3366.56 → 3367.40] Chunky diapers
[3367.40 → 3367.84] Nice
[3367.84 → 3368.54] Yeah
[3368.54 → 3370.58] With like a yellow curry
[3370.58 → 3371.04] Yeah
[3371.04 → 3372.30] So
[3372.30 → 3375.88] Why did you have to bring
[3375.88 → 3377.26] Curry into it
[3377.26 → 3378.60] It looks the same
[3378.60 → 3380.26] Going in as coming out
[3380.26 → 3384.60] That was good
[3384.60 → 3385.12] That was good
[3385.12 → 3386.18] That was awful
[3386.18 → 3387.10] I thought
[3387.10 → 3387.32] Okay
[3387.32 → 3388.12] At first I thought
[3388.12 → 3389.44] This was like a
[3389.44 → 3390.76] Feed the hungry thing
[3390.76 → 3391.96] Not just
[3391.96 → 3392.72] We're going to save money
[3392.72 → 3393.28] On shipping costs
[3393.28 → 3394.08] Because that's a good idea
[3394.08 → 3394.34] Yeah
[3394.34 → 3395.60] So the researchers
[3395.60 → 3396.84] Created flat discs
[3396.84 → 3397.76] That wrap around
[3397.76 → 3398.66] Beads of caviar
[3398.66 → 3399.28] Similar to
[3399.28 → 3400.34] Cannoli
[3400.34 → 3400.82] Cannoli
[3400.82 → 3401.52] I don't know much
[3401.52 → 3402.08] About caviar
[3402.08 → 3402.86] Cannoli
[3402.86 → 3403.94] As well as spaghetti
[3403.94 → 3405.50] That spontaneously divides
[3405.50 → 3406.68] Into smaller noodles
[3406.68 → 3407.72] When dunked in hot water
[3407.72 → 3409.18] Like I could see
[3409.18 → 3410.72] If
[3410.72 → 3411.26] If they
[3411.26 → 3412.54] If they get away with it
[3412.54 → 3413.62] I could see Kraft
[3413.62 → 3414.56] Buying this
[3414.56 → 3415.28] Like
[3415.28 → 3417.04] Patenting the crap out of it
[3417.04 → 3418.08] And that being like
[3418.08 → 3420.06] The only pasta my kids would eat
[3420.06 → 3421.16] They'd be like
[3421.16 → 3422.16] No
[3422.16 → 3423.02] Because it'll like grow
[3423.02 → 3424.36] We want the purple ketchup
[3424.36 → 3425.66] And we want the
[3425.66 → 3427.26] We want the magic noodles
[3427.26 → 3429.72] But now the Kraft package
[3429.72 → 3430.30] Instead of being
[3430.30 → 3431.38] This big
[3431.38 → 3432.48] And that thick
[3432.48 → 3433.02] Yeah
[3433.02 → 3433.82] So it'd be like
[3433.82 → 3435.34] You would just take
[3435.34 → 3436.34] Like this brick of noodles
[3436.34 → 3437.48] It would be like
[3437.48 → 3438.20] You know
[3438.20 → 3440.10] Like the food synthesis machines
[3440.10 → 3441.60] On like futuristic shows
[3441.60 → 3441.86] Right
[3441.86 → 3442.76] Where you just like
[3442.76 → 3443.56] Have the little brick of it
[3443.56 → 3444.18] And you throw it in
[3444.18 → 3444.58] And it's like
[3444.58 → 3445.40] Pasta
[3445.40 → 3446.12] Yeah
[3446.12 → 3446.70] And I mean
[3446.70 → 3447.38] Knowing Kraft
[3447.38 → 3448.14] They'd find a way
[3448.14 → 3449.00] To find something
[3449.00 → 3450.42] That tastes nothing like cheese
[3450.42 → 3451.90] But is somehow delicious anyway
[3451.90 → 3452.88] And mix it in there
[3452.88 → 3453.26] Yeah
[3453.26 → 3453.92] All pre-done
[3453.92 → 3454.58] And you'd just be like
[3454.58 → 3455.76] It's like a
[3455.76 → 3457.90] It's like a KD square
[3457.90 → 3458.48] Yeah
[3458.48 → 3459.54] And maybe
[3459.54 → 3462.00] If America is really nice
[3462.00 → 3464.08] And eats up all their vegetables
[3464.08 → 3466.04] They'll get the good version this time
[3466.04 → 3470.74] Oh my goodness
[3470.74 → 3471.20] Okay
[3471.20 → 3471.96] This is interesting
[3471.96 → 3472.54] Apparently
[3472.54 → 3474.08] Even if you were to pack
[3474.08 → 3475.32] Macaroni perfectly
[3475.32 → 3476.50] Which would be the
[3476.50 → 3478.00] The be all and end all
[3478.00 → 3478.56] Of OCD
[3478.56 → 3480.12] You still end up
[3480.12 → 3481.62] With 67%
[3481.62 → 3483.04] Of the volume
[3483.04 → 3483.82] Wasted as air
[3483.82 → 3484.46] I'm not even surprised
[3484.46 → 3484.80] Yeah
[3484.80 → 3486.52] That makes sense
[3486.52 → 3486.72] Yeah
[3486.72 → 3487.52] So it would be
[3487.52 → 3489.02] Drastically smaller than before
[3489.02 → 3489.68] Okay
[3489.68 → 3490.20] So do you remember
[3490.20 → 3491.24] How we had talked about
[3491.24 → 3493.06] As like an offshoot business
[3493.06 → 3493.66] Potentially
[3493.66 → 3495.70] Building like VR
[3495.70 → 3496.96] Like VR arcades
[3496.96 → 3498.28] Or like local VR centres
[3498.28 → 3498.96] Just as like
[3498.96 → 3499.56] Kind of
[3499.56 → 3500.26] Hey
[3500.26 → 3501.90] LMG has some
[3501.90 → 3502.80] Some cash flow
[3502.80 → 3503.66] Why don't we like
[3503.66 → 3505.14] Invest in a new business idea
[3505.14 → 3506.96] I'm actually glad we didn't
[3506.96 → 3507.18] Yeah
[3507.18 → 3507.44] Me too
[3507.44 → 3508.62] Because IMAX
[3508.62 → 3509.70] Is apparently
[3509.70 → 3511.06] Opening up
[3511.06 → 3512.42] Virtual reality centres
[3512.42 → 3514.78] And I'm sure
[3514.78 → 3515.12] Wow
[3515.12 → 3515.64] IMAX
[3515.64 → 3516.32] Is going to do it
[3516.32 → 3517.00] Better than we would
[3517.00 → 3517.58] It's also
[3517.58 → 3518.70] Really expensive
[3518.70 → 3519.20] Yeah
[3519.20 → 3519.90] It's really expensive
[3519.90 → 3520.96] But IMAX
[3520.96 → 3521.52] Is going to be
[3521.52 → 3522.24] Kind of like
[3522.24 → 3523.62] The premium option
[3523.62 → 3524.90] They actually talked about
[3524.90 → 3525.56] This a fair bit
[3525.56 → 3526.32] At the Acer event
[3526.32 → 3526.94] That I attended
[3526.94 → 3528.62] A few weeks back
[3528.62 → 3529.64] And basically
[3529.64 → 3530.34] They're like
[3530.34 → 3531.22] Creating custom
[3531.22 → 3531.84] So they've got
[3531.84 → 3532.44] All the partnerships
[3532.44 → 3533.40] With the film industry
[3533.40 → 3534.68] So they want to
[3534.68 → 3536.20] Create custom content
[3536.20 → 3537.10] With like
[3537.10 → 3538.50] Triple A IPs
[3538.50 → 3539.78] So people can go in
[3539.78 → 3540.32] And have
[3540.32 → 3541.08] Like
[3541.08 → 3542.90] There's a quote here
[3542.90 → 3543.30] That says
[3543.30 → 3544.18] You walk out of a movie
[3544.18 → 3544.76] All excited
[3544.76 → 3545.50] About having seen
[3545.50 → 3546.10] John Wick
[3546.10 → 3546.80] Or the Avengers
[3546.80 → 3547.28] Yeah
[3547.28 → 3547.88] And you can walk
[3547.88 → 3548.94] Right next door
[3548.94 → 3550.18] Like within the same
[3550.18 → 3550.58] Building
[3550.58 → 3551.62] Right next door
[3551.62 → 3552.80] Not like
[3552.80 → 3553.78] To the next building
[3553.78 → 3555.32] And continue being
[3555.32 → 3556.28] Immersed in that
[3556.28 → 3556.94] Experience
[3556.94 → 3557.62] Because you can
[3557.62 → 3558.54] Like continue the story
[3558.54 → 3559.46] As that character
[3559.46 → 3559.92] Or whatever
[3559.92 → 3561.50] Which is pretty sick
[3561.50 → 3562.20] So in the first
[3562.20 → 3563.50] Four months of 2017
[3563.50 → 3564.68] The pilot centre
[3564.68 → 3565.22] That they have
[3565.22 → 3565.76] Down in LA
[3565.76 → 3566.50] Registered more than
[3566.50 → 3567.90] 25,000 admissions
[3567.90 → 3569.38] With an average revenue
[3569.38 → 3571.28] Of $15,000 per week
[3571.28 → 3572.18] So they're planning
[3572.18 → 3573.22] Five US centres
[3573.22 → 3574.30] And they talked about
[3574.30 → 3575.54] At least back at
[3575.54 → 3576.12] The Acer event
[3576.12 → 3577.06] How they could see
[3577.06 → 3578.04] This becoming like
[3578.04 → 3579.28] A worldwide
[3579.28 → 3580.34] Freaking thing
[3580.34 → 3582.72] So what we had
[3582.72 → 3583.12] Talked about
[3583.12 → 3584.02] Was really a lot
[3584.02 → 3584.50] Smaller
[3584.50 → 3585.22] It was kind of like
[3585.22 → 3586.60] You'd go into
[3586.60 → 3587.38] Like a little
[3587.38 → 3588.60] Place and there
[3588.60 → 3589.44] Would just be like
[3589.44 → 3590.34] You know
[3590.34 → 3591.34] Machines set up
[3591.34 → 3591.70] And you could
[3591.70 → 3592.32] Play VR games
[3592.32 → 3592.88] We took some
[3592.88 → 3594.00] Inspiration from
[3594.00 → 3594.96] A few of the
[3594.96 → 3595.70] Like interesting
[3595.70 → 3596.36] Tech places
[3596.36 → 3597.00] Around the world
[3597.00 → 3598.28] Videos that I've made
[3598.28 → 3598.56] Yep
[3598.56 → 3599.98] And it was going to be
[3599.98 → 3601.02] Like a cool place
[3601.02 → 3601.72] To hang out
[3601.72 → 3602.36] There was probably
[3602.36 → 3603.38] Going to be some food
[3603.38 → 3604.58] And like maybe a bar
[3604.58 → 3606.58] And then in the back
[3606.58 → 3607.58] Somewhere there'd be
[3607.58 → 3609.34] Like VR areas
[3609.34 → 3610.28] Where people
[3610.28 → 3610.88] There'd be like
[3610.88 → 3611.60] A TV set up
[3611.60 → 3612.14] For each station
[3612.14 → 3612.66] So your friends
[3612.66 → 3613.20] Could like kind of
[3613.20 → 3613.84] Watch you play
[3613.84 → 3614.72] And there would be
[3614.72 → 3615.42] Enough setups
[3615.42 → 3616.14] That you could all
[3616.14 → 3617.26] Play against each other
[3617.26 → 3617.88] With each other
[3617.88 → 3618.22] Or whatever
[3618.22 → 3619.58] But we decided not to
[3619.58 → 3620.50] Not only because
[3620.50 → 3622.32] Well we had the
[3622.32 → 3623.18] Foresight to kind of
[3623.18 → 3623.80] Realize that
[3623.80 → 3625.82] If it was super worth it
[3625.82 → 3626.42] Someone else would
[3626.42 → 3627.16] Probably wreck us
[3627.16 → 3627.44] Anyway
[3627.44 → 3628.58] Which sounds like
[3628.58 → 3629.36] It ended up being
[3629.36 → 3630.04] What was going to
[3630.04 → 3630.28] Happen
[3630.28 → 3631.46] And also
[3631.46 → 3633.00] That VR just wasn't
[3633.00 → 3633.70] At all ready yet
[3633.70 → 3634.72] When we wanted to do it
[3634.72 → 3637.44] Oh you know what
[3637.44 → 3638.36] Guildford Mall
[3638.36 → 3640.20] Has a little VR thing
[3640.20 → 3641.10] It's like 35 bucks
[3641.10 → 3641.38] An hour
[3641.38 → 3641.76] Do you know how
[3641.76 → 3642.26] Well it's doing?
[3642.26 → 3643.38] When I went in
[3643.38 → 3643.84] There were like
[3643.84 → 3644.74] Three or four people
[3644.74 → 3645.06] Playing
[3645.06 → 3646.56] I just walked past
[3646.56 → 3646.96] And I was like
[3646.96 → 3647.50] What?
[3648.02 → 3648.24] Yeah
[3648.24 → 3648.96] And I kind of
[3648.96 → 3649.62] Popped my head in
[3649.62 → 3649.88] But
[3649.88 → 3650.68] Yeah
[3650.68 → 3653.04] I think
[3653.04 → 3654.18] That's probably
[3654.18 → 3654.86] Pretty much it
[3654.86 → 3655.32] For the show
[3655.32 → 3656.62] But I do have
[3656.62 → 3657.76] Kind of bombshell
[3657.76 → 3658.34] To drop
[3658.34 → 3659.24] For those of you
[3659.24 → 3660.32] Who have made it
[3660.32 → 3661.60] This far
[3661.60 → 3662.16] So
[3662.16 → 3663.92] It's
[3663.92 → 3664.56] It
[3664.56 → 3665.60] I regret
[3665.60 → 3666.50] Very much
[3666.50 → 3667.68] To inform you guys
[3667.68 → 3668.18] This will be
[3668.18 → 3669.52] I mean I want you guys
[3669.52 → 3670.08] To kind of
[3670.08 → 3671.54] To kind of hear about it
[3671.54 → 3672.08] From us
[3672.08 → 3673.24] Rather than just kind of
[3673.24 → 3674.90] Figure it out eventually
[3674.90 → 3675.48] But
[3675.48 → 3676.52] Nicky V
[3676.52 → 3678.02] Nicky V
[3678.02 → 3679.00] Is moving on
[3679.00 → 3680.38] From Linus Media Group
[3680.38 → 3681.50] This is not
[3681.50 → 3682.46] An April Fool's prank
[3682.46 → 3682.98] Do not
[3682.98 → 3684.26] Adjust your calendars
[3684.26 → 3686.32] Basically
[3686.32 → 3687.38] He's actually
[3687.38 → 3688.40] Taking a position
[3688.40 → 3689.10] Making
[3689.10 → 3690.22] Biking videos
[3690.22 → 3690.58] Which
[3690.58 → 3691.68] Actually makes
[3691.68 → 3692.30] A ton of sense
[3692.30 → 3692.68] For him
[3692.68 → 3693.18] That's something
[3693.18 → 3693.68] That he's always
[3693.68 → 3695.22] Been super passionate about
[3695.22 → 3696.04] But
[3696.04 → 3697.22] I'm excited for him
[3697.22 → 3697.54] Yeah
[3697.54 → 3698.40] It's funny
[3698.40 → 3699.30] We've never
[3699.30 → 3700.60] We've never
[3700.60 → 3701.56] Really lost
[3701.56 → 3702.50] Anyone who made it
[3702.50 → 3703.44] Past their probation
[3703.44 → 3705.26] And in
[3705.26 → 3706.12] Two weeks
[3706.12 → 3706.80] Actually
[3706.80 → 3707.86] Chelsea left
[3707.86 → 3708.64] As some of you
[3708.64 → 3709.84] Probably noticed already
[3709.84 → 3711.28] And we hadn't really
[3711.28 → 3711.94] Kind of figured out
[3711.94 → 3713.18] How to talk about that yet
[3713.18 → 3713.70] And
[3713.70 → 3715.34] Nick Van Merkel
[3715.34 → 3716.26] Will be no more
[3716.26 → 3716.96] Now he's still here
[3716.96 → 3717.82] For two more weeks
[3717.82 → 3719.30] And I had actually
[3719.30 → 3720.10] Asked him already
[3720.10 → 3721.34] If not next Friday
[3721.34 → 3722.20] Because I'll be in Taiwan
[3722.20 → 3723.40] But the Friday after
[3723.40 → 3724.42] Which will be his last day
[3724.42 → 3725.48] If he'd like to
[3725.48 → 3726.44] Come on the WAN show
[3726.44 → 3727.14] And kind of
[3727.14 → 3728.18] Hang out
[3728.18 → 3728.58] Maybe
[3728.58 → 3729.14] I don't know
[3729.14 → 3730.44] Chat with you guys
[3730.44 → 3731.30] Do some Q&A
[3731.30 → 3731.70] Whatever
[3731.70 → 3732.14] Whatever
[3732.14 → 3733.04] Just kind of chill
[3733.04 → 3733.86] One last time
[3733.86 → 3735.40] But that'll be
[3735.40 → 3736.02] That'll be
[3736.02 → 3736.58] Adieu
[3736.58 → 3738.34] So I had an idea
[3738.34 → 3739.82] Off the stream
[3739.82 → 3740.62] But I feel like I should
[3740.62 → 3741.18] Pitch it now
[3741.18 → 3742.08] So I can get the support
[3742.08 → 3743.32] Of the WAN show audience
[3743.32 → 3744.00] Oh my god
[3744.00 → 3745.12] Everyone's freaking out
[3745.12 → 3745.56] Yeah
[3745.56 → 3746.46] If it helps at all
[3746.46 → 3748.00] I feel exactly the same way
[3748.00 → 3748.32] But
[3748.32 → 3749.20] It's
[3749.20 → 3749.68] It's
[3749.68 → 3750.56] It's
[3750.56 → 3751.80] I think it's the right thing
[3751.80 → 3752.66] I think everyone
[3752.66 → 3752.94] For him
[3752.94 → 3753.64] Is freaking out
[3753.64 → 3754.16] To a certain degree
[3754.16 → 3754.58] But yeah
[3754.58 → 3755.50] I agree with Linus
[3755.50 → 3756.26] He's always been
[3756.26 → 3757.28] Into bike stuff
[3757.28 → 3757.84] He's always been
[3757.84 → 3758.88] Into outdoor videos
[3758.88 → 3759.76] Snowboarding videos
[3759.76 → 3760.36] Bike videos
[3760.36 → 3760.74] Or whatever
[3760.74 → 3762.04] And that's
[3762.04 → 3762.62] Totally been his passion
[3762.62 → 3763.82] I'm really excited for him
[3763.82 → 3764.70] I want to see the stuff
[3764.70 → 3765.28] He's going to make
[3765.28 → 3767.02] I think it's
[3767.02 → 3768.94] I don't think it's impossible
[3768.94 → 3770.58] That we'll ever cross paths again
[3770.58 → 3771.22] Yeah
[3771.22 → 3771.84] To be clear
[3771.84 → 3772.20] We're
[3772.20 → 3773.50] We're parting on
[3773.50 → 3775.44] I mean it's still kind of
[3775.44 → 3776.24] You know
[3776.24 → 3777.28] It still kind of stings
[3777.28 → 3778.44] But we're parting on
[3778.44 → 3779.36] Good terms
[3779.36 → 3779.74] So
[3779.74 → 3780.92] I'm kind of hoping
[3780.92 → 3782.64] Some weird tech thing
[3782.64 → 3783.30] Will come out
[3783.30 → 3784.46] That is
[3784.46 → 3785.56] Very well displayed
[3785.56 → 3786.20] On a bike
[3786.20 → 3786.74] Yep
[3786.74 → 3787.50] And we'll just be able
[3787.50 → 3788.50] To kind of work with him
[3788.50 → 3789.34] There'll be an opportunity
[3789.34 → 3790.44] To collab a little bit
[3790.44 → 3791.16] It's not like he won't
[3791.16 → 3792.12] Still be making videos
[3792.12 → 3792.64] Yeah
[3792.64 → 3793.08] He's
[3793.08 → 3794.10] He's not moving out
[3794.10 → 3795.26] Of the Vancouver area
[3795.26 → 3796.58] So he's not going to be
[3796.58 → 3797.58] Like in a completely
[3797.58 → 3798.54] Other country
[3798.54 → 3799.40] Or anything like that
[3799.40 → 3799.68] So
[3799.68 → 3800.54] It's
[3800.54 → 3801.50] It's
[3801.50 → 3802.54] It's
[3802.54 → 3803.50] What is it
[3803.50 → 3803.82] It's
[3803.82 → 3805.32] It's not
[3805.32 → 3806.34] It's not goodbye
[3806.34 → 3807.62] It's seen you later
[3807.62 → 3808.14] Yeah
[3808.14 → 3808.58] Yeah
[3808.58 → 3809.00] Yeah
[3809.00 → 3810.10] So I had an idea
[3810.10 → 3811.92] For like
[3811.92 → 3812.42] One
[3812.42 → 3813.90] One kind of
[3813.90 → 3815.92] Cool channel
[3815.92 → 3816.56] Super fun video
[3816.56 → 3817.04] That he could do
[3817.04 → 3817.58] Before he goes
[3817.58 → 3817.92] Okay
[3817.92 → 3820.04] A last tune up
[3820.04 → 3821.68] A last tune up
[3821.68 → 3822.48] Oh Lord
[3822.48 → 3824.58] Uh
[3824.58 → 3826.50] It might be too much
[3826.50 → 3827.40] I don't know
[3827.40 → 3828.06] It might be too much
[3828.06 → 3828.84] For me to handle
[3828.84 → 3829.64] I'm already going to
[3829.64 → 3830.12] Think of him
[3830.12 → 3831.48] Every time I drive that car
[3831.48 → 3833.40] I'm going to be like
[3833.40 → 3834.50] Ah
[3834.50 → 3835.18] Nicky V
[3835.18 → 3838.30] For those of you
[3838.30 → 3839.04] That don't know
[3839.04 → 3839.66] Which is probably
[3839.66 → 3840.62] Not very many of you
[3840.62 → 3841.02] But
[3841.02 → 3842.44] Linus' car
[3842.44 → 3844.18] The Super Civic
[3844.18 → 3845.02] Or the Lamb
[3845.02 → 3845.72] As it's called
[3845.72 → 3847.10] Was custom
[3847.10 → 3848.38] Custom modded
[3848.38 → 3849.22] Painted
[3849.22 → 3850.78] Designed
[3850.78 → 3851.70] Inspired by
[3851.70 → 3853.80] The one and only
[3853.80 → 3854.30] Nicky V
[3854.30 → 3854.82] Yeah
[3854.82 → 3855.92] There it is
[3855.92 → 3856.70] There it is
[3856.70 → 3857.38] My friends
[3857.38 → 3860.30] All the
[3860.30 → 3861.68] All the modifications
[3861.68 → 3862.64] He even replaced
[3862.64 → 3863.58] By windshield wipers
[3863.58 → 3864.14] Because he was like
[3864.14 → 3865.06] These are straight up
[3865.06 → 3865.60] Dangerous
[3865.60 → 3867.36] Like these are not
[3867.36 → 3868.30] Wiping your windshield
[3868.30 → 3869.04] Anymore
[3869.04 → 3873.20] Painting the
[3873.20 → 3874.64] Painting the racing stripes
[3874.64 → 3882.78] So epic
[3882.78 → 3883.70] So epic
[3883.70 → 3885.08] Yeah
[3885.08 → 3885.54] We
[3885.54 → 3887.00] We created
[3887.00 → 3888.12] A lot of
[3888.12 → 3889.12] Memories together
[3889.12 → 3899.80] It's hilarious
[3899.80 → 3901.06] Sometimes I forget
[3901.06 → 3902.28] How
[3902.28 → 3903.32] Do people still look at it
[3903.32 → 3903.76] The same way
[3903.76 → 3904.40] Or do you think it's like
[3904.40 → 3905.30] Kind of known now
[3905.30 → 3906.10] I
[3906.10 → 3907.76] No I was about to say
[3907.76 → 3909.00] Sometimes I forget
[3909.00 → 3910.06] How
[3910.06 → 3910.76] Like
[3910.76 → 3911.54] Ridiculous
[3911.54 → 3912.92] The car I'm driving is
[3912.92 → 3915.10] And then like
[3915.10 → 3916.32] I'll drive past a school
[3916.32 → 3917.44] And kids will start
[3917.44 → 3918.18] Like cheering
[3918.18 → 3919.06] Like
[3919.06 → 3920.06] What are they cheering
[3920.06 → 3920.44] Oh
[3920.44 → 3920.76] Oh
[3920.76 → 3921.32] Right
[3921.32 → 3922.74] Oh it's the watermelon car
[3922.74 → 3924.34] Oh it's that car again
[3924.34 → 3924.70] Yeah
[3924.70 → 3925.32] So
[3925.32 → 3928.48] It is with
[3928.48 → 3930.34] It is with a heavy heart
[3930.34 → 3931.90] That I
[3931.90 → 3933.30] That I make that announcement
[3933.30 → 3934.26] Got people asking
[3934.26 → 3935.04] What's going to happen
[3935.04 → 3936.18] With Channel Super Fun
[3936.18 → 3937.36] Channel Super Fun
[3937.36 → 3938.60] Is actually kind of up in the air
[3938.60 → 3939.96] For a number of reasons
[3939.96 → 3943.38] Not anything to do with
[3943.38 → 3944.04] Like it's already
[3944.04 → 3945.62] It's already been up in the air
[3945.62 → 3946.72] For a while
[3946.72 → 3949.66] But we're really not sure
[3949.66 → 3950.52] What to do with it
[3950.52 → 3951.26] Like it's
[3951.26 → 3953.68] It's at the point now
[3953.68 → 3954.90] Where instead of being fun
[3954.90 → 3955.80] It's kind of stressful
[3955.80 → 3956.98] To get them done
[3956.98 → 3958.00] So
[3958.00 → 3959.46] An option could be
[3959.46 → 3960.10] To just like
[3960.10 → 3961.36] Not have an upload schedule
[3961.36 → 3961.88] For it
[3961.88 → 3962.32] Yeah
[3962.32 → 3963.48] Like to just do it whenever
[3963.48 → 3965.18] Another option
[3965.18 → 3966.42] That I've proposed
[3966.42 → 3967.08] Is
[3967.08 → 3969.06] Still having it be a weekly upload
[3969.06 → 3970.88] But just limiting the editing time
[3970.88 → 3971.58] Down to pretty much
[3971.58 → 3972.42] Kind of cutting together
[3972.42 → 3973.66] Some fun thing that we did
[3973.66 → 3974.58] And making
[3974.58 → 3976.30] Making it more about
[3976.30 → 3977.28] Us just kind of going
[3977.28 → 3978.24] And doing something fun
[3978.24 → 3978.74] For a bit
[3978.74 → 3979.50] And less about
[3979.50 → 3980.34] Making a video
[3980.34 → 3980.94] That's fun
[3980.94 → 3981.34] Yeah
[3981.34 → 3982.28] So I'm
[3982.28 → 3983.70] I'm really just not sure
[3983.70 → 3985.92] Yeah
[3985.92 → 3987.02] I'm not really sure
[3987.02 → 3989.52] Where we're going to go with that
[3989.52 → 3992.78] But
[3992.78 → 3993.36] That's
[3993.36 → 3994.34] That's where we're at
[3994.34 → 3995.46] A lot of people are saying
[3995.46 → 3996.56] RGB the Civic
[3996.56 → 3997.84] RGB the Civic
[3997.84 → 3998.24] Yeah
[3998.24 → 3999.04] That's illegal
[3999.04 → 3999.84] Yeah
[3999.84 → 4001.22] We'll see
[4001.22 → 4001.68] We'll see
[4001.68 → 4002.08] I might
[4002.08 → 4002.98] I might
[4002.98 → 4004.58] I might want to leave the Civic
[4004.58 → 4006.18] As is
[4006.18 → 4006.86] Yeah
[4006.86 → 4008.38] In honour of Nicky V
[4008.38 → 4008.86] Yeah
