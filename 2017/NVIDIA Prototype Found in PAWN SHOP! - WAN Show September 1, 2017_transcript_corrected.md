[0.00 → 5.90] I'm doing it! I'm doing it! We're live! It's WAN Showtime!
[6.40 → 12.28] Or rather, it was WAN Showtime a little while ago, but we ran into an issue.
[12.44 → 16.88] Can I get that tangle of fans, actually? Alex, do you mind?
[17.42 → 23.40] Yeah, so just to give you guys some idea of what sort of problem we were dealing with before the show here.
[23.94 → 28.70] Well, this is part of it, and Alex probably has some other parts of it,
[28.70 → 32.02] but not on hand because he's actually still working on the video.
[32.32 → 34.18] Oh, yeah. Oh, that's good. That's good. Yep.
[34.78 → 35.94] Yeah, we got...
[35.94 → 45.42] There is going to be some definite school of hard knocks engineering going on in this video right here.
[45.62 → 48.98] So that should be pretty good, but we've got a great show for you guys today.
[49.16 → 53.08] I think, as you may or may not have noticed, I have...
[53.08 → 54.80] What? What's this?
[55.22 → 56.04] Hi, everybody!
[56.04 → 58.04] Oh, I...
[58.04 → 61.86] See, I don't understand the politically correct culture these days.
[62.74 → 64.20] Are we even allowed to do that?
[64.90 → 66.68] Yeah, like, I don't know. Is that, like, an...
[66.68 → 70.04] Like, is that Italian, or, like, are you allowed to...
[70.04 → 70.96] It's Dr. Nick.
[71.38 → 71.66] Yeah, no, I...
[71.66 → 73.64] He's a minority because there's only one Dr. Nick.
[73.70 → 75.46] Yeah, so I don't know if you're allowed to do that.
[75.50 → 76.00] No, I was recently...
[76.00 → 77.06] No, that's canon. You can do that.
[77.06 → 81.06] No, I was recently informed that you're not allowed to say...
[81.74 → 89.08] Max is a member of a Facebook group where you're not allowed to say you all because it's cultural appropriation.
[89.70 → 92.72] And I was kind of sitting here going, but that's just a word.
[92.90 → 93.74] Isn't it just a...
[93.74 → 94.82] It's appropriating whom?
[94.82 → 100.34] Um, not who you'd think is all I'm really going to get into.
[100.90 → 103.20] But, um, yeah, I just thought... What's it called? A conjunction?
[104.40 → 104.68] Yeah.
[104.86 → 106.88] Yeah. I thought it was just you all.
[107.08 → 107.60] It is.
[107.70 → 108.88] Yeah, I thought that.
[108.92 → 114.08] I guess it depends on who started it, but I think the people who started it are part of an imperialistic,
[114.20 → 115.02] capitalistic society.
[115.10 → 115.64] It's fair game.
[115.64 → 120.10] Because that society is grounded and formed around appropriation.
[120.18 → 120.76] That's all they do.
[121.44 → 121.56] Hmm.
[121.64 → 122.20] That's all we do.
[122.56 → 122.88] All right.
[122.94 → 125.42] Well, we've got a bunch of great topics for you guys today.
[125.84 → 130.22] Intel launches Leon W for workstations,
[130.34 → 136.24] further separating their server Leon products from their Core i7, Core i9,
[136.68 → 143.22] and Core i whatever else, and oh, also Pentium consumer products.
[143.22 → 149.10] And Ry zen Thread ripper gets rounded out with the final chip, the 1900X.
[149.22 → 150.06] It has arrived.
[150.84 → 153.12] Yeah, I don't think anyone was really waiting for it,
[153.20 → 155.08] but we'll talk about that in more depth later.
[155.46 → 161.36] AMD is rumoured to be losing $100 or more on every Vega 64 they sell,
[161.84 → 164.22] which would be pretty bananas if true,
[164.22 → 167.38] although I have no guarantee whatsoever that it actually is.
[167.70 → 168.56] And what else we got here?
[168.74 → 171.30] And Linus' phone number and email are probably on the internet now,
[171.30 → 176.20] as there's been a huge Instagram breach of 6 million users' data.
[177.82 → 178.18] Oh.
[178.44 → 178.68] Yeah.
[178.90 → 179.14] Great.
[179.22 → 181.34] I'm glad we're covering that.
[183.38 → 183.80] Hey, man.
[183.86 → 184.40] News is news.
[184.90 → 187.12] This is unbiased, objective journalism.
[191.08 → 192.86] You're looking into it right now, aren't you?
[193.10 → 193.34] No.
[193.34 → 205.18] Fake news.
[205.46 → 207.32] That's Luke sitting on the couch in the intro.
[209.88 → 210.60] Fake news.
[210.98 → 212.04] No, that's me on the right.
[213.98 → 214.72] Yeah, right.
[215.76 → 216.52] Yeah, the right.
[217.20 → 217.70] Wait, what?
[217.70 → 220.60] All right.
[221.08 → 224.38] So, for those of you who aren't familiar, this is James.
[224.48 → 225.46] He's one of the new writers.
[225.72 → 227.94] I don't even know if it's fair to call you guys new anymore.
[228.04 → 229.58] Have you been here, what, like six months almost?
[231.06 → 231.86] Something like that?
[231.92 → 232.20] I don't know.
[232.26 → 232.64] Five?
[232.96 → 233.20] Five?
[233.28 → 233.76] Since February.
[234.02 → 234.38] February?
[234.80 → 235.64] That's like six months.
[235.66 → 236.98] Yeah, that's like six months.
[237.12 → 237.56] Congratulations.
[237.56 → 238.38] Thank you.
[238.38 → 239.02] Thank you, Colton.
[239.16 → 240.60] It's freaking crazy, yeah.
[240.82 → 240.98] Oh.
[241.56 → 244.58] I mean, people are apparently throwing things out there.
[244.70 → 250.52] So, James is actually the one who prepares the WAN show document for us every week and
[250.52 → 252.80] has been doing so for about the last...
[252.80 → 253.54] The entire time.
[253.56 → 255.16] Yeah, pretty much since you started, right?
[255.16 → 255.60] The week I started, yeah.
[255.60 → 255.76] Yeah.
[255.86 → 258.00] So, the first week he did it, it kind of sucked.
[258.58 → 259.30] That's not true.
[259.42 → 261.80] And then the second week, it was like pretty decent.
[261.80 → 265.60] And since then, I mean, honestly, it's been kind of hard to tell the difference, which
[265.60 → 272.56] either means that James is a rock star or means that Colton was just, frankly, never any
[272.56 → 275.68] better at this than some guy who started like two weeks ago.
[276.46 → 276.84] Bit of both.
[277.08 → 277.60] All right.
[277.68 → 280.58] So, first topic here is Thread ripper.
[281.34 → 282.04] I know.
[282.22 → 283.70] It wouldn't be WAN show.
[283.76 → 284.46] I wish I could.
[284.60 → 285.94] Without all the Thread ripper news.
[285.96 → 286.88] See what I have to work with here?
[286.94 → 287.84] He gets touchscreens.
[288.16 → 288.46] Oh, yeah.
[288.92 → 289.76] Poor you.
[289.76 → 291.16] This trackpad sucks.
[291.30 → 292.78] A 2016 LG Gram.
[292.88 → 294.12] And who has the 2017 one?
[294.56 → 294.84] Me.
[294.84 → 295.00] You.
[295.60 → 296.62] It's a way grander mirror.
[296.86 → 300.72] Because that is the way of the world.
[301.74 → 302.84] That's the curl of the burl.
[302.98 → 303.54] Big dog.
[303.80 → 304.36] Big dog.
[305.82 → 307.50] And then table scraps dog.
[307.70 → 307.90] Ha.
[308.42 → 308.96] Ha ha.
[309.14 → 310.22] Oh, that's how it's going to be.
[310.36 → 310.66] All right.
[310.88 → 315.00] So, the original topic here was posted on the forum by Ono Tech.
[315.66 → 317.60] And basically, I don't know.
[317.76 → 318.54] I don't even know.
[318.60 → 319.24] I don't get it.
[319.48 → 320.52] How is this even newsworthy?
[320.62 → 321.50] Why is this even in here?
[321.60 → 322.66] You can explain it to me.
[322.66 → 323.54] Thread ripper in the title, dude.
[323.60 → 324.14] That's news.
[324.14 → 326.08] Am I right?
[327.30 → 328.70] Unfortunately, yes.
[329.08 → 329.76] Look at the KPIs.
[329.76 → 331.46] Anything Thread ripper related is news.
[331.46 → 339.68] But this is a skew that beyond a very limited use case, frankly, I don't really understand.
[339.68 → 348.14] So, the Thread ripper 1900X has the same 64 PCIe lanes as the other Thread ripper skews.
[348.58 → 355.98] It's got the same LGA, whatever it is, TR4 socket as the other Thread ripper skews.
[355.98 → 360.00] It's got a nice, you know, high base clock.
[360.54 → 371.50] 3.8 versus 3.6 gigahertz for the 1800X, which is the lower clocked, actually very similar version of kind of the same processor.
[371.50 → 374.10] Because this is only an 8-core chip.
[375.00 → 383.26] So, it's more comparable to the 1800X in terms of its performance than it is to its bigger brothers, the 1920X and the 1950X.
[383.32 → 383.44] Right.
[383.50 → 388.92] To spin it another way, it basically almost is the 1900X, except with a slightly higher base clock.
[388.92 → 389.92] You mean the 1800X.
[390.02 → 401.38] The 1900X is almost like the 1800X, except it has a higher base clock, and it basically grants you access to all the X399 goodies for $50 more.
[401.52 → 405.50] So, for $50 more, you get the privilege of buying a more expensive motherboard.
[406.58 → 407.04] Right.
[407.46 → 408.76] Quite a bit more expensive motherboard.
[408.88 → 410.62] Yeah, a lot more expensive motherboard.
[410.82 → 413.88] Not to mention that now you can go buy quad-channel memory.
[413.88 → 420.42] Quad-channel memory that will probably never be necessary for any kind of reasonable workload for an 8-core processor.
[422.12 → 425.42] Now, to be clear, I can come up with a...
[425.42 → 427.48] Thanks, Bixby.
[427.88 → 430.68] I don't know what prompted Bixby to start yakking over there.
[431.18 → 435.50] Now, to be clear, there are a couple workloads I can think of for this.
[435.90 → 438.56] So, for example, Asus released...
[438.56 → 439.40] What was it?
[439.44 → 442.94] I think a 19 PCIe slot motherboard.
[443.88 → 445.80] I'm going to have to double-check this.
[445.86 → 446.86] It might not have been 19.
[447.10 → 447.82] Yeah, here it is.
[448.20 → 456.26] Asus debuts the B250 Expert Mining Ethereum motherboard with 19 PCIe slots.
[458.02 → 465.02] So, with a Thread ripper chip, you could theoretically do, like, what?
[465.48 → 466.86] Like, 60 of them?
[466.86 → 477.04] So, you could literally just cover, like, an EAT motherboard in PCIe 1X slots and power adapters.
[477.42 → 479.42] Apparently, I didn't even realize this.
[479.48 → 481.06] It's not just graphics cards.
[481.62 → 487.98] It is also 1,000-watt-plus power supplies that are running into huge supply issues right now.
[488.06 → 488.92] I was talking to a system...
[488.92 → 489.70] Oh, is that right?
[489.70 → 494.00] Yeah, I was down at Puget Systems yesterday, as some of you guys are probably aware if you saw the stream.
[494.32 → 496.46] And they're like, yeah, it's, like, actually a problem.
[496.56 → 498.52] We're having a hard time getting 1,000-watt power supplies.
[500.34 → 502.10] Which may also explain...
[502.10 → 503.12] Okay, you go.
[503.22 → 507.60] ...why Corsair didn't want to send us their AX1500i for that build that we're doing.
[508.32 → 511.98] Because they can probably turn around and sell that thing, like, billy-o.
[511.98 → 514.72] Yeah, but what's worth more to them?
[514.92 → 519.40] The retail price of that power supply or whatever exposure we hope...
[519.40 → 519.88] Well, I don't know.
[519.94 → 522.30] That's, like, a $400-plus power supply.
[522.46 → 524.52] So, it's pretty significant.
[525.52 → 528.38] Yeah, but the ad inventory on our channel is worth more than $400.
[528.84 → 529.22] Yeah, maybe.
[531.80 → 538.36] The one 1,000-watt power supply that is no problem for us to get is the $1,000 one, though.
[538.88 → 539.96] That puppy's 1,200 watts.
[540.38 → 541.22] Is it 1,200 watts?
[541.24 → 541.96] It's 1,200 watts.
[541.98 → 543.14] I thought it was 1,000-watt.
[543.98 → 544.28] No.
[544.40 → 546.04] Do you want to talk about the build that you have coming up?
[546.90 → 548.54] Kind of, but it's kind of secret, too.
[549.04 → 550.00] No, I don't think it's...
[550.00 → 550.96] Oh, well, okay, we don't...
[550.96 → 552.34] It uses an embargoed case.
[552.50 → 552.80] Yes.
[553.24 → 554.68] Okay, it uses an embargoed case.
[554.68 → 563.44] But I know you guys saw some of the low-end stuff that we're always focused on.
[563.78 → 563.92] Okay?
[564.72 → 565.82] And you guys were like,
[566.20 → 571.84] Linus, why are you guys always doing all the low-end stuff all the time?
[571.98 → 574.00] I want something that I can't afford.
[574.00 → 578.24] I want to see a $6,000 Thread ripper build.
[578.66 → 580.96] And James is here to answer the call.
[581.48 → 582.46] Yes, I am.
[582.98 → 584.66] It's pretty badass.
[584.66 → 589.22] It's got 128 gigabytes of RAM, which...
[589.22 → 590.44] I didn't even know that.
[590.70 → 591.74] It has eight Simms.
[592.16 → 594.76] But wait, more importantly, they're all RGB.
[594.76 → 599.24] You see, this is what I have to deal with around here.
[599.30 → 601.46] I'm no longer even in control of the ship.
[602.40 → 603.58] It's just like...
[603.58 → 605.66] It doesn't just hit icebergs.
[606.10 → 608.54] It, like, calls to the icebergs.
[608.54 → 609.76] You've got icebergs working on the ship.
[609.78 → 612.22] It takes, like, a big hook, and it kind of goes,
[612.36 → 612.64] Woo!
[613.24 → 615.22] Where'd the icebergs be at, beaches?
[615.86 → 618.72] And it pulls them in and kapok!
[618.96 → 619.78] You don't even know yet.
[620.00 → 621.50] Six months in, this is only the tip of the iceberg.
[623.64 → 627.34] Okay, and I can't take full credit for all the terrible puns
[627.34 → 629.74] that have been in the videos recently either,
[629.84 → 633.14] as you guys can clearly, clearly see.
[633.62 → 635.22] I think that we've hit peak pun.
[635.44 → 636.32] We're on the way down now.
[636.34 → 637.08] They've all been used.
[638.20 → 639.62] Like, in the first build guide I did,
[639.68 → 640.78] which was the RGB build guide,
[640.78 → 643.14] every paragraph was a pun,
[643.24 → 645.56] because you could talk about the chassis or the case
[645.56 → 645.92] and say,
[646.10 → 647.14] In this case?
[647.70 → 648.68] But now that's been done.
[648.84 → 649.44] Yeah, but I...
[649.44 → 651.92] Okay, yeah, but that was your first time doing it.
[652.00 → 653.96] I had already done it many, many times.
[654.64 → 655.76] So should we just keep them coming?
[656.06 → 656.98] Just...
[656.98 → 658.94] They're always fresh, every time.
[659.02 → 660.92] I think we do keep them coming,
[661.02 → 662.68] because, you know, if you do that,
[662.98 → 664.90] then they'll always be in a state of ecstasy.
[666.14 → 666.82] Or cringe.
[670.78 → 675.10] I'll admit, it took me longer to get that
[675.10 → 675.56] than it should have.
[675.74 → 676.34] I had to look.
[677.56 → 680.52] Alright, so why don't we get back to the 1900X.
[681.00 → 682.84] So basically, the point of this chip
[682.84 → 685.82] is if you need quad-core...
[685.82 → 686.54] Wait, okay.
[686.62 → 687.72] You need quad-channel memory,
[688.04 → 689.96] and you need a ton of PCI-E lanes,
[690.18 → 692.72] but you don't want a high-core count processor.
[694.60 → 695.72] Or maybe...
[696.44 → 698.16] And this is the pitch that I've heard
[698.16 → 700.42] for something like a 7740X
[700.42 → 702.10] on the Intel side of things.
[702.66 → 705.34] Maybe you want to invest in a platform
[705.34 → 707.16] that has a greater...
[707.86 → 709.16] has greater opportunities
[709.72 → 711.56] for upgrading in the future,
[711.56 → 713.78] and you just don't have the money
[713.78 → 714.68] to spend right now.
[715.78 → 716.34] But...
[716.34 → 718.48] So would that be someone who's maybe...
[718.48 → 720.54] They're getting this for a professional use case,
[720.60 → 721.86] but it's still their side business?
[722.44 → 723.60] They haven't jumped in fully?
[723.68 → 724.16] Because this is...
[724.16 → 725.46] We're talking about a high ceiling here.
[725.46 → 727.72] Yes, we're talking you could go all the way
[727.72 → 728.92] from 8 to 16,
[729.28 → 730.40] or, you know,
[731.02 → 732.84] word on the street is that AMD
[732.84 → 735.50] would love to deliver even more cores than that
[735.50 → 736.98] in their gaming lineup.
[737.06 → 738.50] And it wouldn't be that much of a stretch,
[738.56 → 740.88] because to my knowledge,
[740.98 → 743.98] the TR4 socket is not that different
[743.98 → 745.38] from the server socket.
[745.90 → 748.74] So there's already 32 core processors there.
[748.88 → 750.88] Really, how much more of a challenge is it
[750.88 → 753.26] for them to deliver a 32 core on the desktop,
[753.26 → 755.12] assuming that we could figure out
[755.12 → 756.32] how to cool the bloody thing,
[756.68 → 757.70] which is actually...
[757.70 → 758.66] Maybe we'll talk about that
[758.66 → 759.74] in a little bit more depth later.
[759.82 → 761.80] That's a video that Anthony's been working on,
[762.08 → 763.32] like a taming the beast.
[763.98 → 765.52] Is air cooling
[765.52 → 767.66] or water cooling
[767.66 → 769.00] a better answer
[769.00 → 771.12] for these super high wattage
[771.12 → 772.64] new CPUs like Thread ripper?
[774.64 → 776.14] And the answer may surprise you.
[776.54 → 776.82] Ooh.
[777.62 → 779.68] I'm hoping this is going to be a callback
[779.68 → 781.78] to the D-wave quantum computing.
[782.94 → 783.96] It's going to be up there.
[784.14 → 784.72] Oh, right.
[784.86 → 786.16] Like, we have to pull a vacuum
[786.16 → 788.52] to cool a 32 core Thread ripper.
[788.64 → 789.70] It's got to be superconductors
[789.70 → 791.38] and Namibia.
[791.38 → 791.80] You know what?
[791.86 → 792.72] I've already filmed it,
[792.76 → 793.56] so it's far too late,
[793.60 → 794.30] and that's not in it.
[794.34 → 796.16] So you'll just have to sit and be sad.
[796.72 → 797.28] All right.
[797.30 → 798.44] Let's move on to the
[798.44 → 799.42] quote-unquote
[799.42 → 800.60] frickin' huge
[800.60 → 802.00] Instagram breach.
[802.20 → 803.60] Apparently, I'm screwed.
[804.26 → 805.88] I haven't read this article yet.
[805.92 → 806.74] It was posted by
[806.74 → 807.92] Ollie on the forum.
[808.14 → 809.24] The original article here
[809.24 → 810.34] is from Ars Technica,
[810.58 → 811.76] but maybe James
[811.76 → 812.86] would like to explain
[812.86 → 814.40] exactly how
[814.40 → 815.52] I am screwed
[815.52 → 816.26] because of this.
[816.46 → 817.62] I'm not sure if you're screwed,
[817.70 → 818.32] but it's only $10
[818.32 → 820.46] US to find out
[820.46 → 821.18] how screwed you are.
[821.88 → 822.70] So what happened was
[822.70 → 825.06] it started off as a bug.
[825.18 → 826.02] What a value!
[826.84 → 827.62] That's what your
[827.62 → 829.10] privacy is worth.
[829.10 → 831.02] So what started off
[831.02 → 831.66] as a bug
[831.66 → 833.84] or an exploit
[833.84 → 835.04] available from Instagram
[835.04 → 837.28] got totally scaled up
[837.28 → 838.88] by some industrious hacker.
[839.80 → 840.76] Basically, there was a bug.
[841.08 → 843.72] Some kind of
[843.72 → 845.96] data security research firm
[845.96 → 846.52] thought that
[846.52 → 848.44] this bug could not be exploited
[848.44 → 850.38] in an automated way,
[850.92 → 852.44] but then this hacker,
[852.68 → 853.86] who ended up contacting
[853.86 → 854.70] Ars Technica,
[855.30 → 856.72] did manage to automate it
[856.72 → 858.42] so that he was able to
[858.42 → 860.40] scrape this giant database
[860.40 → 861.98] of Instagram's
[861.98 → 863.34] 700 million users
[863.34 → 865.12] at a rate of
[865.12 → 866.22] what is it?
[866.24 → 866.60] A million?
[867.82 → 869.58] A million accounts per hour.
[869.70 → 870.80] A million accounts per hour.
[870.90 → 871.74] So he managed to get
[871.74 → 872.84] six million accounts
[872.84 → 873.68] into a database.
[873.94 → 875.54] Then he put that database online
[875.54 → 878.16] in a quarriable website.
[878.68 → 879.96] It's $10 a query.
[880.22 → 880.92] You can type in
[880.92 → 882.12] an Instagram handle
[882.12 → 883.54] and get either
[883.54 → 884.94] a phone number,
[885.18 → 885.58] an email,
[885.68 → 886.24] or both.
[886.98 → 887.40] Wow.
[887.56 → 888.46] So this person
[888.46 → 889.66] contacted Ars Technica
[889.66 → 891.04] and actually provided them
[891.04 → 892.30] with a 10,000 record
[892.30 → 893.84] example spreadsheet
[893.84 → 894.92] of the type of data
[894.92 → 895.80] that he had scraped.
[896.36 → 897.10] And then they had
[897.10 → 897.70] some statistics
[897.70 → 898.84] from that spreadsheet.
[899.04 → 900.08] So I think it was
[900.08 → 901.64] 4,000 out of the 10,000
[901.64 → 902.80] had both emails
[902.80 → 903.68] and phone numbers.
[903.84 → 904.18] Wow.
[904.38 → 905.14] And then the remaining
[905.14 → 906.80] 6,000 had a mix.
[907.50 → 908.08] And then if you were
[908.08 → 909.30] looking at that spreadsheet
[909.30 → 910.56] based on the usernames,
[911.02 → 912.00] they found out that
[912.00 → 913.00] they were verified
[913.00 → 913.90] actual accounts,
[913.98 → 914.80] not just bots
[914.80 → 915.44] or whatever.
[916.24 → 917.38] And they also found out
[917.38 → 918.72] that looking at the emails
[918.72 → 919.50] and the phone numbers
[919.50 → 921.50] just based on area codes
[921.50 → 921.80] and stuff,
[921.88 → 922.64] it seemed like
[922.64 → 923.92] the personal data
[923.92 → 924.98] matched the accounts.
[925.16 → 925.98] It looks real.
[926.60 → 927.08] Interesting.
[927.08 → 930.60] So to be clear,
[930.60 → 933.64] not everyone got breached.
[934.22 → 934.80] So I mean,
[934.86 → 935.62] even at a rate
[935.62 → 936.72] of a million accounts
[936.72 → 937.22] an hour,
[937.34 → 937.88] it would have taken
[937.88 → 939.18] almost two weeks
[939.18 → 940.86] to download the entire
[940.86 → 943.22] 700 million user records.
[943.46 → 944.92] But it's still
[944.92 → 945.60] a significant problem.
[946.98 → 949.26] And I mean,
[949.32 → 950.06] another thing is,
[950.14 → 950.60] I guess realistically,
[951.34 → 952.42] there's not 700 million
[952.42 → 953.44] active users.
[953.44 → 954.12] So no,
[954.20 → 954.42] actually,
[954.52 → 956.08] if you look at graphs
[956.08 → 958.08] of user to post ratio,
[958.20 → 959.54] like the vast majority
[959.54 → 960.84] of Instagram accounts
[960.84 → 961.74] have never posted.
[962.30 → 962.44] Right.
[962.56 → 963.86] They're just created.
[964.20 → 966.96] So probably you're okay,
[967.44 → 969.34] but also maybe
[969.34 → 970.58] you're super not okay.
[971.70 → 973.88] And depends on if there's
[973.88 → 974.86] any logic in the scrape
[974.86 → 975.82] and how it targeted people.
[976.12 → 976.92] But the biggest risk here
[976.92 → 978.72] is that some,
[979.18 → 980.82] for some exposed people,
[980.82 → 981.98] it's their email
[981.98 → 982.72] and their phone
[982.72 → 983.64] that have been exposed.
[984.22 → 985.06] And didn't you
[985.06 → 986.24] get hacked one time?
[986.88 → 987.88] Because someone had
[987.88 → 988.92] your email and phone number?
[988.92 → 989.52] It was a little more
[989.52 → 990.40] complicated than that.
[990.48 → 991.08] But yes,
[991.22 → 992.68] it is possible
[992.68 → 994.08] if you have someone's
[994.08 → 994.62] phone number
[994.62 → 995.02] and you know
[995.02 → 996.08] who their carrier is
[996.08 → 997.06] and you can manage
[997.06 → 998.10] to convince their carrier
[998.10 → 999.36] that you are that person,
[999.54 → 1000.60] it's possible to get
[1000.60 → 1001.48] a SIM issued
[1001.48 → 1002.40] in that number.
[1002.90 → 1003.82] And then you can use
[1003.82 → 1004.70] that phone
[1004.70 → 1005.90] to break into
[1005.90 → 1006.62] other accounts
[1006.62 → 1008.20] that are using
[1008.20 → 1009.24] two-factor authentication
[1009.24 → 1010.50] with the phone number
[1010.50 → 1011.18] as a backup.
[1012.54 → 1012.96] So,
[1013.16 → 1014.74] good luck everyone
[1014.74 → 1016.66] and let's go ahead
[1016.66 → 1017.48] and move on
[1017.48 → 1018.28] to our next topic.
[1018.94 → 1020.06] Amazon turns
[1020.06 → 1021.14] thousands of
[1021.14 → 1021.96] Twitch streamers,
[1023.02 → 1024.72] that's us right now,
[1024.88 → 1026.00] which is why
[1026.00 → 1026.92] we can't show you
[1026.92 → 1027.20] anything,
[1027.30 → 1027.88] oh, no, no,
[1027.92 → 1028.64] can't show you that,
[1029.08 → 1031.38] into product pitchmen.
[1032.08 → 1033.02] Poor ladies,
[1033.18 → 1033.64] as it were.
[1033.90 → 1034.82] Original article here
[1034.82 → 1035.76] is from Bloomberg.
[1036.96 → 1037.82] You know I like
[1037.82 → 1038.18] the Bloomberg.
[1038.18 → 1039.70] I always like to throw
[1039.70 → 1040.04] a couple of
[1040.04 → 1040.68] Boom burgs in there.
[1040.78 → 1041.76] Sure, that's fine.
[1041.86 → 1042.18] I like it.
[1043.12 → 1044.32] So, Spencer Super
[1044.32 → 1045.80] says,
[1045.90 → 1047.32] Amazon.com Inc.
[1047.40 → 1047.98] will pay commission
[1047.98 → 1048.40] to gamers,
[1048.56 → 1048.72] artists,
[1048.82 → 1048.98] chefs,
[1049.06 → 1049.44] and others
[1049.44 → 1050.82] on its Twitch
[1050.82 → 1051.52] interactive video
[1051.52 → 1052.08] streaming service
[1052.08 → 1052.86] for selling products
[1052.86 → 1053.54] to their fans
[1053.54 → 1054.72] through its retail site.
[1055.20 → 1055.48] I mean,
[1055.52 → 1056.26] to be clear,
[1056.60 → 1058.24] it's not like
[1058.24 → 1059.22] Amazon wasn't
[1059.22 → 1060.26] already paying
[1060.26 → 1061.16] Twitch streamers
[1061.16 → 1063.24] to sell products
[1063.24 → 1064.04] to the people
[1064.04 → 1064.64] who were viewing.
[1064.78 → 1065.04] I mean,
[1065.26 → 1066.12] it's no secret
[1066.12 → 1067.34] that Linus Media Group
[1067.34 → 1067.84] is a member
[1067.84 → 1069.18] of the Amazon Associates
[1069.18 → 1070.18] affiliate program
[1070.18 → 1071.46] and anyone
[1071.46 → 1072.34] who's a member
[1072.34 → 1073.14] of the program,
[1073.88 → 1074.56] if someone
[1074.56 → 1075.34] were to buy
[1075.34 → 1075.82] a product
[1075.82 → 1076.44] through their
[1076.44 → 1077.32] affiliate link,
[1077.68 → 1078.32] they would get
[1078.32 → 1078.80] a commission.
[1079.02 → 1079.28] I mean,
[1079.68 → 1080.48] that's something
[1080.48 → 1081.26] that legally
[1081.26 → 1082.52] you have to disclose.
[1082.80 → 1083.18] The only thing
[1083.18 → 1084.02] that's new here,
[1084.02 → 1090.02] is that they've
[1090.02 → 1090.48] integrated
[1090.48 → 1091.16] these affiliate
[1091.16 → 1092.34] links and widgets
[1092.34 → 1093.08] right onto
[1093.08 → 1094.62] streamers' pages.
[1095.74 → 1095.90] So,
[1096.14 → 1096.80] assumingly,
[1096.88 → 1097.74] we could at some point
[1097.74 → 1098.52] just point down
[1098.52 → 1098.80] and say,
[1098.90 → 1099.06] yeah,
[1099.20 → 1099.74] check out these
[1099.74 → 1100.14] headphones
[1100.14 → 1100.66] in this little
[1100.66 → 1101.48] picture right here.
[1102.32 → 1103.44] And I think
[1103.44 → 1103.84] the commissions
[1103.84 → 1105.14] are probably the same.
[1105.20 → 1106.08] It says you can get
[1106.08 → 1106.46] a commission
[1106.46 → 1108.16] of up to 10%,
[1108.16 → 1109.08] and I think
[1109.08 → 1109.76] most affiliates
[1109.76 → 1110.32] can get that
[1110.32 → 1111.20] provided you sell
[1111.20 → 1111.82] enough volume.
[1111.82 → 1113.32] But the lower end
[1113.32 → 1114.78] is usually 4%?
[1117.56 → 1117.98] Yeah,
[1118.06 → 1118.78] at the low end,
[1118.86 → 1119.28] it's usually
[1119.28 → 1121.00] about 4% higher,
[1121.26 → 1121.88] and it depends
[1121.88 → 1122.46] on the category
[1122.46 → 1122.94] as well.
[1123.36 → 1123.76] So,
[1123.96 → 1124.80] some categories,
[1125.10 → 1125.70] and I believe
[1125.70 → 1126.92] this is posted publicly,
[1127.10 → 1127.70] so I don't think...
[1127.70 → 1128.04] Oh, definitely.
[1128.12 → 1128.70] You can just Google it.
[1128.70 → 1129.42] Anyone can join
[1129.42 → 1130.68] an Amazon affiliate program.
[1130.98 → 1131.50] You scroll down
[1131.50 → 1132.36] to the bottom of Amazon,
[1133.08 → 1133.78] there's like a
[1133.78 → 1134.90] become a partner
[1134.90 → 1135.58] or something link
[1135.58 → 1135.98] on the bottom.
[1136.10 → 1136.54] You can do this
[1136.54 → 1137.16] with Etsy
[1137.16 → 1138.96] and all sorts of websites.
[1139.90 → 1141.00] Affiliate dash program.
[1141.20 → 1141.34] Yeah,
[1141.34 → 1141.74] it looks like
[1141.74 → 1142.14] you don't have
[1142.14 → 1142.76] to be logged in
[1142.76 → 1143.66] or anything like that.
[1143.86 → 1144.10] So,
[1144.54 → 1144.76] like,
[1144.88 → 1145.72] digital services,
[1145.96 → 1146.56] for example,
[1146.88 → 1147.64] some of them
[1147.64 → 1148.28] are actually
[1148.28 → 1149.38] not percentage-based.
[1149.48 → 1149.62] Like,
[1149.68 → 1150.28] if you sign someone
[1150.28 → 1150.92] up for Prime,
[1151.30 → 1151.92] then you get
[1151.92 → 1152.98] just a fixed bounty.
[1153.46 → 1154.30] Sometimes they'll
[1154.30 → 1155.00] do bonuses.
[1155.86 → 1156.12] But yeah,
[1156.18 → 1156.60] here we go.
[1156.72 → 1156.84] So,
[1156.94 → 1157.50] some...
[1157.50 → 1157.66] Oh,
[1157.78 → 1158.70] Amazon gift cards
[1158.70 → 1159.72] don't get anything anymore.
[1159.80 → 1160.06] Apparently,
[1160.16 → 1161.02] neither does wine.
[1162.10 → 1163.04] That's a funny thing,
[1163.12 → 1163.30] that,
[1163.36 → 1164.12] because I would think
[1164.12 → 1164.92] there's enough margin
[1164.92 → 1165.48] in alcohol
[1165.48 → 1166.64] that you could afford to...
[1166.64 → 1167.22] That's kind of a little
[1167.22 → 1168.34] British turn of phrase
[1168.34 → 1168.74] you did there.
[1169.56 → 1169.78] Hmm?
[1169.92 → 1170.56] Funny thing,
[1170.56 → 1170.84] that.
[1171.12 → 1171.42] Oh,
[1171.54 → 1171.86] well...
[1171.86 → 1172.26] I liked it.
[1172.50 → 1172.80] Well,
[1172.88 → 1173.30] thank you.
[1174.24 → 1175.12] Video games
[1175.12 → 1176.32] and game consoles
[1176.32 → 1178.46] are a 1% commission.
[1178.76 → 1178.94] Ooh,
[1178.98 → 1179.08] see,
[1179.14 → 1179.82] that's going to be harsh
[1179.82 → 1180.86] for the streamers,
[1180.90 → 1181.24] for sure.
[1181.40 → 1181.68] Yep.
[1182.54 → 1182.98] Televisions,
[1183.16 → 1183.80] 2%.
[1183.80 → 1184.92] PC components
[1184.92 → 1185.72] used to be closer
[1185.72 → 1187.48] to like 3.5% to 4%,
[1187.48 → 1188.88] and now they are
[1188.88 → 1190.16] 2.5%.
[1190.16 → 1191.22] Toys are 3%.
[1191.22 → 1191.96] So basically,
[1192.10 → 1192.70] the stuff that's
[1192.70 → 1193.70] easy to sell,
[1194.10 → 1195.60] where there's like...
[1195.60 → 1198.34] So many like
[1198.34 → 1199.28] gaming sites
[1199.28 → 1200.40] and gaming blogs
[1200.40 → 1201.62] and game streamers,
[1202.12 → 1203.50] where they just really,
[1203.58 → 1203.82] I guess,
[1203.86 → 1204.34] feel like they don't
[1204.34 → 1205.38] have to work that hard at it,
[1205.50 → 1206.76] really low commission rates.
[1206.76 → 1208.00] But then you move up
[1208.00 → 1209.14] into digital music,
[1209.98 → 1211.48] physical music,
[1212.40 → 1213.60] handmade things,
[1213.74 → 1214.08] groceries,
[1214.32 → 1214.98] digital videos,
[1215.12 → 1215.90] 5%.
[1215.90 → 1217.12] You move all the way up
[1217.12 → 1217.86] to like headphones,
[1218.26 → 1219.06] musical instruments,
[1219.28 → 1220.54] business and industrial supplies,
[1220.66 → 1220.78] ooh,
[1220.86 → 1222.00] now you're talking 6%.
[1222.00 → 1224.80] And you can get up to 10%
[1224.80 → 1226.42] for men's and kids
[1226.42 → 1227.14] private label
[1227.14 → 1228.44] digital video games,
[1228.70 → 1229.10] luxury,
[1229.44 → 1229.88] beauty,
[1230.44 → 1231.40] Amazon coins,
[1231.60 → 1233.10] and Amazon fashion women.
[1233.96 → 1236.52] Are there any Twitch streamers
[1236.52 → 1238.62] in like the beauty cosmetic space?
[1238.88 → 1239.54] Like they're on YouTube?
[1240.00 → 1240.78] You know what?
[1240.82 → 1242.06] To be perfectly honest with you,
[1242.24 → 1244.98] I have never watched
[1244.98 → 1245.80] a Twitch stream
[1245.80 → 1248.56] outside of tuning into Luke's
[1248.56 → 1249.68] with like it muted
[1249.68 → 1251.14] to kind of talk to his chat.
[1252.00 → 1252.96] I don't really,
[1253.08 → 1254.28] I don't really get it.
[1255.04 → 1255.36] Okay.
[1255.82 → 1256.08] Yeah.
[1256.22 → 1256.52] Well.
[1256.66 → 1257.92] I'm old and stuff.
[1258.50 → 1259.74] So like I'm like,
[1259.74 → 1261.00] I'm like shaking my cane
[1261.00 → 1261.90] on the front porch,
[1262.04 → 1263.20] like old man style.
[1263.38 → 1265.10] Like my kids are going to be like,
[1265.18 → 1265.34] yeah,
[1265.38 → 1265.94] I watch,
[1266.08 → 1266.52] you know,
[1266.66 → 1269.98] whatever Cameron person
[1269.98 → 1271.04] and I'm going to be like,
[1271.68 → 1274.48] go outside,
[1274.98 → 1276.20] go kick a ball,
[1276.48 → 1277.30] like go,
[1277.44 → 1277.62] go,
[1277.74 → 1277.90] go,
[1277.90 → 1278.84] just do anything,
[1279.02 → 1279.74] anything but that.
[1279.84 → 1281.18] But I'm going to be wrong
[1281.18 → 1281.98] and those people
[1281.98 → 1282.82] are going to be like
[1282.82 → 1284.42] the superstars
[1284.42 → 1285.32] of that generation
[1285.32 → 1286.18] and it's,
[1286.64 → 1287.22] and it's,
[1287.34 → 1288.40] I'm going to be old
[1288.40 → 1289.16] and I accept that.
[1289.76 → 1290.60] So there you go.
[1291.22 → 1291.96] At least you're still saying
[1291.96 → 1292.70] going to be old.
[1294.06 → 1294.50] Yeah,
[1294.74 → 1295.08] I don't know,
[1295.10 → 1295.96] I'm 31 now,
[1296.06 → 1296.74] I feel pretty old.
[1298.64 → 1299.36] All right,
[1299.48 → 1301.00] so let's have a look
[1301.00 → 1301.90] at our next topic here.
[1303.22 → 1303.82] Oh yeah,
[1303.94 → 1304.82] did we go through
[1304.82 → 1306.10] like what's different about it?
[1306.18 → 1306.42] Really?
[1307.18 → 1308.12] Apparently the commissions
[1308.12 → 1308.74] will be available
[1308.74 → 1310.90] to 22,000 Twitch partners.
[1311.30 → 1311.84] I really think
[1311.84 → 1312.44] it's just the widget.
[1313.18 → 1314.68] I think the 23,000 partners
[1314.68 → 1315.56] might just be the number
[1315.56 → 1316.90] of partners they have.
[1317.16 → 1317.98] Like partners is just
[1317.98 → 1318.50] like creators
[1318.50 → 1319.26] who have signed up
[1319.26 → 1320.06] or streamers
[1320.06 → 1320.68] who have signed up
[1320.68 → 1321.80] for the affiliate program.
[1321.94 → 1322.06] Is it not?
[1322.06 → 1322.16] Yeah,
[1322.20 → 1322.34] no,
[1322.40 → 1322.92] it depends on
[1322.92 → 1324.62] because there's different,
[1324.62 → 1325.14] yeah,
[1325.26 → 1326.10] there are different tiers
[1326.10 → 1326.88] of Twitch partners.
[1327.16 → 1327.72] That's something
[1327.72 → 1328.40] that I do know
[1328.40 → 1329.36] because I know that Luke,
[1329.46 → 1330.14] even though he like
[1330.14 → 1331.16] doesn't,
[1331.40 → 1332.02] at times,
[1332.02 → 1332.80] hasn't met like
[1332.80 → 1333.94] certain partner requirements
[1333.94 → 1334.48] as a partner
[1334.48 → 1335.34] and then like I think
[1335.34 → 1336.08] we are even though
[1336.08 → 1336.90] we definitely
[1336.90 → 1338.08] don't meet the partner
[1338.08 → 1338.66] requirements.
[1338.98 → 1339.42] They just like us.
[1339.58 → 1339.80] Yeah,
[1339.88 → 1340.92] so it's a little bit complicated.
[1342.00 → 1342.56] All right.
[1343.04 → 1344.24] But as far as Amazon's concerned,
[1344.34 → 1345.02] this is kind of just
[1345.02 → 1347.62] their version of YouTube.
[1347.90 → 1348.38] You know how Amazon
[1348.38 → 1349.08] touches everything,
[1349.18 → 1349.30] right?
[1349.90 → 1350.96] Prime is their Netflix,
[1351.14 → 1352.04] they've got grocery now.
[1353.04 → 1353.82] Even though this is
[1353.82 → 1354.22] a much,
[1354.40 → 1355.64] much smaller version
[1355.64 → 1357.76] of a video platform.
[1358.04 → 1358.54] What did it say?
[1358.60 → 1360.06] They have 10 million viewers
[1360.06 → 1360.42] a day.
[1360.86 → 1361.26] Crazy.
[1362.02 → 1363.00] But compared to YouTube,
[1363.08 → 1363.44] it's nothing.
[1364.06 → 1364.48] So,
[1365.26 → 1367.22] speaking of nothing,
[1368.00 → 1369.50] let's say your phone
[1369.50 → 1370.82] had nothing on it
[1370.82 → 1371.52] in terms of storage.
[1371.62 → 1372.26] This is pretty cool.
[1373.22 → 1373.74] SanDisk
[1373.74 → 1375.12] just launched
[1375.12 → 1377.80] their largest ever
[1377.80 → 1379.22] micro SD card.
[1380.58 → 1381.22] But wait,
[1381.56 → 1383.38] it's exactly the same size
[1383.38 → 1384.34] as the other ones.
[1384.56 → 1385.26] You mean it's still
[1385.26 → 1386.36] micro?
[1387.56 → 1388.56] How else would it
[1388.56 → 1389.24] fit in the slot?
[1389.36 → 1390.12] Come on, you guys.
[1390.20 → 1390.84] Clearly we meant
[1390.84 → 1391.48] the capacity.
[1391.48 → 1392.22] It's in.
[1392.42 → 1393.30] It's the largest ever.
[1393.40 → 1395.66] It costs $250.
[1397.02 → 1397.68] But if you,
[1397.84 → 1399.00] for whatever reason,
[1399.46 → 1400.38] felt like you needed
[1400.38 → 1401.24] to carry around,
[1401.34 → 1402.46] what would that be?
[1402.58 → 1403.18] That's like,
[1403.58 → 1403.84] what,
[1404.00 → 1405.28] 15 Blu-rays
[1405.28 → 1406.20] worth of data?
[1407.50 → 1408.68] If you felt like
[1408.68 → 1410.00] you had a phone
[1410.00 → 1410.80] that was capable
[1410.80 → 1411.90] of playing back,
[1412.34 → 1413.74] I don't even know.
[1413.80 → 1414.24] Can you do that?
[1414.28 → 1414.90] Can you play back
[1414.90 → 1415.66] like an MKV
[1415.66 → 1416.20] on a phone?
[1416.20 → 1417.32] I guess it's probably
[1417.32 → 1417.78] possible.
[1417.94 → 1418.58] Like there's VLC.
[1419.38 → 1420.10] Are they powerful enough?
[1420.22 → 1420.36] Yeah.
[1420.48 → 1420.64] I mean,
[1420.68 → 1421.74] do they have
[1421.74 → 1422.94] hardware decoding
[1422.94 → 1423.36] for that?
[1424.16 → 1424.58] Not sure.
[1424.64 → 1424.88] Actually,
[1424.98 → 1425.90] Android Oreo might.
[1426.36 → 1427.08] I know that Oreo
[1427.08 → 1428.08] just added some new
[1428.08 → 1428.56] codecs,
[1428.70 → 1429.36] like from Sony.
[1429.46 → 1429.84] There was a
[1429.84 → 1431.02] proprietary Sony
[1431.02 → 1432.22] codec that Oreo
[1432.22 → 1432.82] is supporting now.
[1432.82 → 1433.26] It would depend
[1433.26 → 1433.88] on the hardware,
[1434.06 → 1434.16] though.
[1434.24 → 1434.62] So it would be
[1434.62 → 1436.10] if the Arena GPU
[1436.10 → 1437.82] has like hardware
[1437.82 → 1439.94] decoding for that
[1439.94 → 1441.34] quality of H.265.
[1441.36 → 1441.54] I mean,
[1441.60 → 1442.04] probably.
[1442.42 → 1443.04] People are probably
[1443.04 → 1443.62] correcting me in
[1443.62 → 1444.04] Twitch chat,
[1444.14 → 1444.40] but yeah,
[1444.46 → 1444.84] I guess there's
[1444.84 → 1445.66] probably no reason
[1445.66 → 1446.18] you couldn't play
[1446.18 → 1447.18] back full quality
[1447.18 → 1447.80] Blu-rays on your
[1447.80 → 1448.06] phone.
[1448.08 → 1448.28] Plus,
[1448.34 → 1448.72] a lot of phones
[1448.72 → 1449.28] are getting HDR
[1449.28 → 1449.60] now.
[1449.74 → 1450.48] Other than that,
[1450.52 → 1451.00] it would be really
[1451.00 → 1452.34] stupid because,
[1453.22 → 1453.82] honestly,
[1454.00 → 1454.96] on a phone screen,
[1455.42 → 1456.60] it is pretty hard
[1456.60 → 1457.40] to tell the difference
[1457.40 → 1458.24] between like a
[1458.24 → 1459.68] decent 720p video
[1459.68 → 1461.26] stream and like
[1461.26 → 1462.20] the highest quality
[1462.20 → 1463.00] that you can stream
[1463.00 → 1463.52] on Plex,
[1463.62 → 1464.38] let alone like
[1464.38 → 1465.56] full Blu-ray quality.
[1465.92 → 1466.38] But here's the
[1466.38 → 1466.82] question that was
[1466.82 → 1467.32] on my mind
[1467.32 → 1467.82] when I read this
[1467.82 → 1468.12] headline.
[1468.48 → 1468.66] Yeah.
[1468.84 → 1469.46] I kind of thought,
[1470.10 → 1470.60] big deal,
[1470.72 → 1471.18] like can't they
[1471.18 → 1472.26] release a headline
[1472.26 → 1472.98] like this every
[1472.98 → 1473.28] month?
[1473.42 → 1474.22] Like is this just
[1474.22 → 1475.10] an incremental
[1475.10 → 1475.82] upgrade?
[1476.18 → 1476.58] Because these,
[1476.74 → 1476.90] you know,
[1476.94 → 1478.18] just like processing
[1478.18 → 1478.50] power,
[1478.62 → 1479.28] these things are
[1479.28 → 1480.64] just up and to
[1480.64 → 1481.38] the right at all
[1481.38 → 1481.80] times.
[1482.12 → 1482.94] Yes and no.
[1483.08 → 1483.30] I mean,
[1483.36 → 1484.12] it has slowed
[1484.12 → 1484.88] down even in the
[1484.88 → 1485.90] time since Linus
[1485.90 → 1486.56] Media Group was
[1486.56 → 1486.90] founded.
[1487.14 → 1488.12] All of this stuff
[1488.12 → 1489.08] has slowed down
[1489.08 → 1490.24] significantly.
[1490.56 → 1491.30] Like it used to
[1491.30 → 1492.50] be that you got a
[1492.50 → 1493.60] new like doubling
[1493.60 → 1494.24] of hard drive
[1494.24 → 1494.80] capacities.
[1495.02 → 1495.60] It felt like
[1495.60 → 1496.68] every few months
[1496.68 → 1498.72] and you know,
[1498.80 → 1498.98] in the
[1499.06 → 1499.20] okay,
[1499.30 → 1499.66] so here,
[1500.12 → 1500.84] in the time
[1500.84 → 1501.92] since I've been
[1501.92 → 1502.90] a PC enthusiast,
[1502.96 → 1503.36] so it must have
[1503.36 → 1503.98] been in around
[1503.98 → 1504.68] 2003,
[1504.82 → 1505.38] 2004,
[1505.38 → 1506.74] when you went
[1506.74 → 1507.28] to the store
[1507.28 → 1508.14] and bought like
[1508.14 → 1509.14] a decent sized
[1509.14 → 1509.80] hard drive,
[1509.98 → 1511.52] it was 120 gigs.
[1512.02 → 1512.20] Oh,
[1512.22 → 1512.58] I remember the
[1512.58 → 1512.96] first computer
[1512.96 → 1513.48] that my family
[1513.48 → 1513.68] bought,
[1513.78 → 1514.54] it was 30 gigs.
[1514.68 → 1514.88] Okay,
[1515.10 → 1516.36] so in 2003,
[1516.50 → 1517.08] 2004,
[1517.40 → 1518.32] like an enthusiast
[1518.32 → 1518.80] would run out
[1518.80 → 1519.50] and buy a hard drive
[1519.50 → 1520.10] that was anywhere
[1520.10 → 1522.30] from 80 to 120 gigs.
[1522.30 → 1522.88] And you could get
[1522.88 → 1523.34] higher ones,
[1523.40 → 1523.68] but they were
[1523.68 → 1524.50] like pretty pricey.
[1525.50 → 1525.82] Okay,
[1526.22 → 1527.40] when Linus Media Group
[1527.40 → 1527.76] started,
[1527.86 → 1528.74] that was 2003,
[1528.86 → 1529.52] that was 10 years
[1529.52 → 1529.88] later.
[1530.04 → 1530.26] 13.
[1530.66 → 1532.38] It was about
[1532.38 → 1533.64] three terabytes.
[1535.10 → 1536.12] Since then,
[1536.58 → 1537.12] so that is,
[1537.12 → 1537.80] that is what,
[1537.92 → 1539.48] a factor of what,
[1539.56 → 1540.66] so times 10 times
[1540.66 → 1540.90] three,
[1540.98 → 1542.48] so that's 30 times
[1542.48 → 1543.40] the size in that
[1543.40 → 1543.96] 10 years.
[1544.34 → 1545.58] So since then,
[1545.58 → 1546.26] we've gone from
[1546.26 → 1547.08] three to 12.
[1547.94 → 1548.62] So we've managed
[1548.62 → 1549.36] to 4x,
[1549.52 → 1549.98] and it's been
[1549.98 → 1550.94] almost five years.
[1551.54 → 1553.00] So think about that.
[1553.66 → 1553.96] Well,
[1554.02 → 1554.34] I actually
[1554.34 → 1555.20] catfished you a little bit
[1555.20 → 1555.78] because the answer
[1555.78 → 1556.28] to my questions
[1556.28 → 1557.40] is in the show notes.
[1557.76 → 1559.48] Because this new
[1559.48 → 1560.36] 400 gigabyte card
[1560.36 → 1560.76] is going to be
[1560.76 → 1561.70] the new world record
[1561.70 → 1562.68] holder for this format.
[1563.40 → 1564.82] And the previous
[1564.82 → 1565.62] holder that they're
[1565.62 → 1568.00] displacing was
[1568.00 → 1571.12] Samsung,
[1571.12 → 1573.00] who had 256 gigabytes.
[1573.22 → 1573.42] Yep.
[1573.72 → 1574.12] And that's just
[1574.12 → 1574.56] last year.
[1574.56 → 1575.62] But it had been
[1575.62 → 1576.26] a little while.
[1576.58 → 1577.22] So that's something
[1577.22 → 1577.78] that you might not
[1577.78 → 1578.58] be factoring in.
[1578.78 → 1580.24] And honestly,
[1580.46 → 1581.60] I think the bigger deal
[1581.60 → 1582.98] for mobile storage,
[1583.34 → 1584.58] for flashcards,
[1584.68 → 1585.40] is really going to be
[1585.40 → 1586.18] a speed increase
[1586.18 → 1587.54] versus just
[1587.54 → 1588.96] continuing to ramp up
[1588.96 → 1589.50] the capacity.
[1589.66 → 1590.44] Because we've got
[1590.44 → 1591.32] standards like,
[1591.44 → 1593.54] shoot,
[1593.70 → 1594.26] what's that?
[1595.98 → 1596.70] There's a new
[1596.70 → 1598.00] tiny card standard.
[1598.42 → 1599.40] It's escaping me
[1599.40 → 1599.88] right now.
[1600.04 → 1601.02] But we've got standards
[1601.02 → 1601.70] coming that are going
[1601.70 → 1602.94] to perform much more
[1602.94 → 1604.46] similarly to a full speed
[1604.46 → 1605.34] SATA drive or even
[1605.34 → 1606.70] a PCI Express drive.
[1607.32 → 1608.58] And this card,
[1608.98 → 1609.22] sure,
[1609.44 → 1610.14] 400 gigs,
[1610.34 → 1611.36] but it only copies
[1611.36 → 1612.64] data at 100 megabytes
[1612.64 → 1613.16] a second.
[1613.58 → 1614.82] So it would actually
[1614.82 → 1616.06] take a really,
[1616.24 → 1617.46] really long time
[1617.46 → 1618.12] to fill it up.
[1618.38 → 1618.40] Like,
[1618.84 → 1619.42] I don't,
[1619.60 → 1620.32] it's not like you
[1620.32 → 1621.42] could use your phone
[1621.42 → 1622.84] as like a super
[1622.84 → 1623.70] high speed,
[1624.14 → 1624.56] you know,
[1624.70 → 1627.08] external drive
[1627.08 → 1628.30] for your laptop
[1628.30 → 1629.22] when you're on the road
[1629.22 → 1630.08] and you're video editing
[1630.08 → 1630.90] or something like that.
[1630.94 → 1631.68] Not at those kinds
[1631.68 → 1632.16] of speeds.
[1632.32 → 1632.84] No, that's bunk.
[1632.84 → 1633.46] So I don't really
[1633.46 → 1634.40] understand what you're
[1634.40 → 1635.36] going to be keeping on it
[1635.36 → 1636.14] unless it's something
[1636.14 → 1636.84] ridiculous like,
[1637.00 → 1637.82] oh, I need to carry
[1637.82 → 1638.70] my Blu-ray collection
[1638.70 → 1639.08] with me.
[1639.24 → 1639.66] Yeah, eventually
[1639.66 → 1640.34] this is just going
[1640.34 → 1640.90] to be your,
[1640.96 → 1642.04] your way,
[1642.14 → 1642.44] way, way
[1642.44 → 1643.26] cold storage backup.
[1643.50 → 1643.92] This is your
[1643.92 → 1644.74] Amazon Glacier.
[1646.22 → 1647.26] Micro SD cards?
[1647.80 → 1648.48] Micro SD cards?
[1648.48 → 1649.00] Yeah, you did?
[1649.08 → 1649.48] Yeah, I got the
[1649.48 → 1650.28] whole business here.
[1650.70 → 1651.86] Amazing, amazing,
[1652.04 → 1653.76] amazing storage density.
[1654.98 → 1656.46] Don't mind that the cost
[1656.46 → 1657.96] is just completely
[1657.96 → 1659.38] uncompetitive with tape.
[1659.52 → 1660.50] Don't worry about that.
[1660.50 → 1662.28] Also, the incredibly
[1662.28 → 1663.50] complicated controller
[1663.50 → 1664.66] we need to access,
[1665.08 → 1665.32] you know,
[1665.94 → 1667.50] I mean, what would that be?
[1667.56 → 1668.16] That would be like,
[1668.74 → 1668.96] you know,
[1669.02 → 1670.90] a thousand micro SD cards
[1670.90 → 1672.08] in the space of a single
[1672.08 → 1674.14] tape drive cartridge.
[1674.60 → 1674.64] Like,
[1675.68 → 1678.08] what controller is that?
[1678.10 → 1678.74] Because you'd basically
[1678.74 → 1679.56] be looking at,
[1679.62 → 1679.80] like,
[1679.94 → 1681.80] an incredibly complex
[1681.80 → 1682.76] SSD controller
[1682.76 → 1683.40] by that point.
[1684.52 → 1685.10] All right,
[1685.10 → 1685.76] what else we got
[1685.76 → 1686.50] for today?
[1687.04 → 1688.22] What else is interesting?
[1688.22 → 1688.54] You want to talk
[1688.54 → 1689.64] about this Arby Touch stuff?
[1689.64 → 1691.10] Yeah, sure,
[1691.22 → 1691.36] why not?
[1691.36 → 1691.52] Like,
[1691.56 → 1692.64] I normally organize
[1692.64 → 1693.24] the show notes
[1693.24 → 1694.46] with more boring things
[1694.46 → 1695.18] or niche things
[1695.18 → 1695.92] at the bottom,
[1696.00 → 1696.86] and this is pretty close
[1696.86 → 1697.30] to the bottom,
[1697.40 → 1698.36] but I feel like I'm here,
[1698.98 → 1700.80] and I think it's kind of cool.
[1701.00 → 1701.24] Sure.
[1701.82 → 1702.00] Like,
[1702.08 → 1703.40] the screenshot is in the show notes,
[1703.62 → 1704.56] so we should just
[1704.56 → 1705.86] open it that way.
[1706.36 → 1706.88] So basically,
[1707.14 → 1708.06] we've been on,
[1708.14 → 1708.22] like,
[1708.26 → 1709.60] this wonky keyboard kick
[1709.60 → 1710.22] for a little while.
[1710.22 → 1710.44] We?
[1711.28 → 1711.68] Hey,
[1711.68 → 1713.94] I just work here.
[1714.44 → 1714.58] Yeah.
[1715.54 → 1716.24] So I've done,
[1716.34 → 1716.42] like,
[1716.48 → 1718.72] three alternative keyboards.
[1718.84 → 1719.84] We did the Advantage 2,
[1719.94 → 1720.94] which is an ergonomic one,
[1721.00 → 1722.46] then we did the Safe Type keyboard,
[1722.60 → 1724.14] which is just a more obscure
[1724.14 → 1725.24] ergonomic keyboard,
[1725.34 → 1727.14] and now we've done
[1727.14 → 1727.84] the OrbiT ouch,
[1727.92 → 1728.58] which is coming out
[1728.58 → 1730.32] on Flow plane
[1730.32 → 1731.20] and on YouTube soon.
[1731.30 → 1731.94] So the OrbiT ouch
[1731.94 → 1733.04] is a keyless keyboard.
[1733.18 → 1734.56] It's got these two domes
[1734.56 → 1735.30] that you move around
[1735.30 → 1736.68] in a coordinated fashion.
[1737.20 → 1738.22] The process is called
[1738.22 → 1738.62] cording.
[1738.98 → 1739.38] So basically,
[1739.54 → 1739.80] there's,
[1739.92 → 1740.62] I think,
[1740.70 → 1741.86] eight or so
[1741.86 → 1742.96] different clusters
[1742.96 → 1743.56] of letters
[1743.56 → 1745.16] on the one hand,
[1745.68 → 1747.34] and you point to one cluster,
[1747.54 → 1748.34] and then with the other hand,
[1748.38 → 1749.66] you specify which symbol
[1749.66 → 1750.24] in the cluster
[1750.24 → 1751.46] you actually want to do.
[1751.62 → 1752.88] Sounds like a cluster to me.
[1753.32 → 1753.82] Woo-hoo!
[1755.50 → 1755.98] Okay,
[1756.12 → 1757.32] but beyond the actual keyboard,
[1757.32 → 1758.54] the company has actually
[1758.54 → 1759.48] ported this same
[1759.48 → 1760.58] typing method to VR,
[1761.44 → 1762.34] and while the keyboard
[1762.34 → 1763.20] is aimed at people
[1763.20 → 1764.20] who have low
[1764.20 → 1765.10] finger dexterity,
[1765.52 → 1766.22] in VR,
[1766.22 → 1766.94] it's actually probably
[1766.94 → 1768.20] just the better way
[1768.20 → 1769.24] to type for everybody.
[1769.56 → 1769.78] Right,
[1769.84 → 1771.44] because you just gesture
[1771.44 → 1774.40] for which key
[1774.40 → 1774.98] you want to press.
[1775.08 → 1775.48] Unfortunately,
[1775.66 → 1776.54] your link doesn't work
[1776.54 → 1777.16] because you linked
[1777.16 → 1778.10] to your own inbox.
[1778.60 → 1778.86] Oh,
[1778.92 → 1779.36] I didn't know that
[1779.36 → 1779.94] worked that way.
[1780.04 → 1780.22] Yeah,
[1780.38 → 1780.52] no,
[1780.66 → 1781.74] that's definitely
[1781.74 → 1782.26] not a thing.
[1782.26 → 1782.68] Just show my inbox.
[1783.24 → 1783.60] Well,
[1783.66 → 1784.24] I've not logged in.
[1784.84 → 1785.88] You have the keys.
[1786.74 → 1787.34] Sort of.
[1787.40 → 1788.04] Go to LastPass,
[1788.14 → 1788.72] get my password,
[1788.82 → 1789.38] go to my email,
[1789.46 → 1789.98] show everybody.
[1790.28 → 1790.58] No,
[1790.64 → 1791.42] I don't have
[1791.42 → 1792.56] your LastPass information.
[1792.70 → 1793.22] That's not how
[1793.22 → 1794.00] LastPass works.
[1795.00 → 1796.14] I actually can't look
[1796.14 → 1797.32] at what you store in it
[1797.32 → 1799.66] without locking you out.
[1800.60 → 1800.78] Oh,
[1801.16 → 1802.20] maybe I'm using it wrong
[1802.20 → 1802.50] and I shouldn't
[1802.50 → 1803.08] have put that in there.
[1806.16 → 1806.56] Anyway,
[1806.62 → 1807.10] the point is,
[1807.68 → 1809.26] everyone who's used VR
[1809.26 → 1809.98] has probably felt
[1809.98 → 1810.64] a little silly
[1810.64 → 1811.72] holding these
[1811.72 → 1813.18] kick-ass touch controllers
[1813.18 → 1814.18] and then using them
[1814.18 → 1815.76] to laser beam
[1815.76 → 1817.94] a letter on a keyboard
[1817.94 → 1817.96] one at a time.
[1817.96 → 1817.98] Yeah,
[1817.98 → 1818.54] it's actually
[1818.54 → 1819.32] really inefficient
[1819.32 → 1820.20] and the worst part
[1820.20 → 1820.68] about it
[1820.68 → 1821.88] is that whenever
[1821.88 → 1822.44] you're pointing
[1822.44 → 1823.02] at a letter,
[1823.30 → 1824.28] when you pull the trigger,
[1824.28 → 1825.34] it moves your hand
[1825.34 → 1825.86] a little bit.
[1826.54 → 1827.20] So typing with
[1827.20 → 1828.58] any kind of reasonable speed
[1828.58 → 1829.30] is actually
[1829.30 → 1830.72] pretty difficult.
[1830.96 → 1831.64] And fatiguing.
[1832.12 → 1832.36] I mean,
[1832.46 → 1833.94] if you like to
[1833.94 → 1834.80] Tom Cruise it
[1834.80 → 1835.36] and always hold
[1835.36 → 1836.46] your touch controller
[1836.46 → 1836.96] out like that
[1836.96 → 1837.48] instead of
[1837.48 → 1838.32] Brandon Seeing it
[1838.32 → 1838.70] and holding it
[1838.70 → 1839.32] close to your body,
[1840.00 → 1841.44] after all that typing time,
[1841.50 → 1842.30] your arm's going to get tired.
[1842.46 → 1842.56] You know?
[1842.56 → 1845.48] Speaking of your arms
[1845.48 → 1846.44] getting tired,
[1846.72 → 1847.70] let's go ahead
[1847.70 → 1848.26] and do one of our
[1848.26 → 1849.04] sponsor spots,
[1849.18 → 1849.70] Synergy.
[1850.40 → 1851.98] So Synergy allows you
[1851.98 → 1852.76] to use,
[1853.02 → 1854.64] let's see,
[1855.20 → 1856.00] allows you to use
[1856.00 → 1856.84] one keyboard
[1856.84 → 1857.94] and one mouse
[1857.94 → 1859.44] with multiple systems.
[1859.78 → 1860.42] So let's say,
[1860.54 → 1861.04] for example,
[1861.26 → 1862.30] that I had a
[1862.30 → 1864.62] like a Mac Pro,
[1864.76 → 1865.36] MacBook Pro
[1865.36 → 1866.52] that I like to use
[1866.52 → 1867.34] for development.
[1867.66 → 1868.12] And let's say,
[1868.22 → 1868.56] for example,
[1868.56 → 1869.68] that I had a Windows desktop
[1869.68 → 1870.44] that I like to use
[1870.44 → 1870.92] for gaming.
[1871.74 → 1872.10] Typical.
[1872.10 → 1872.92] Typical.
[1873.04 → 1873.42] That's right.
[1873.60 → 1874.52] Instead of being,
[1874.86 → 1875.62] instead of having to have
[1875.62 → 1876.94] a separate set of peripherals
[1876.94 → 1877.52] on my desk
[1877.52 → 1878.30] for each of them,
[1878.62 → 1879.38] I could just have
[1879.38 → 1880.24] a single keyboard
[1880.24 → 1881.00] and mouse hooked up
[1881.00 → 1882.02] to both of them
[1882.02 → 1883.70] through the network.
[1884.10 → 1885.38] So you just install
[1885.38 → 1886.64] Synergy on your systems
[1886.64 → 1887.56] and boom,
[1887.66 → 1888.88] you can drag your mouse
[1888.88 → 1889.98] across the screens
[1889.98 → 1891.06] completely seamlessly.
[1891.64 → 1892.36] They've got a basic
[1892.36 → 1893.02] and pro option
[1893.02 → 1893.88] with a one-time payment
[1893.88 → 1895.04] for lifetime access
[1895.04 → 1896.50] and the features include
[1896.50 → 1897.74] things like clipboard sharing
[1897.74 → 1898.64] between the computers,
[1899.42 → 1900.34] which is pretty
[1900.34 → 1901.26] freaking cool,
[1901.26 → 1902.16] dragging and dropping
[1902.16 → 1903.26] files between the computers,
[1903.38 → 1904.16] the ability to set up
[1904.16 → 1905.74] hotkeys and more.
[1906.20 → 1907.26] And what's really cool
[1907.26 → 1907.92] about Synergy
[1907.92 → 1909.30] is that they actually
[1909.30 → 1910.74] give us a wicked
[1910.74 → 1912.26] freaking awesome
[1912.26 → 1913.44] discount to give you guys.
[1913.52 → 1914.92] You can save 50%
[1914.92 → 1916.16] off Synergy
[1916.16 → 1917.32] by going to
[1917.32 → 1918.64] seamless.com
[1918.64 → 1919.52] slash Synergy
[1919.52 → 1920.96] slash Linus25.
[1921.46 → 1922.96] That's seamless.com
[1922.96 → 1923.62] slash Synergy
[1923.62 → 1924.88] slash Linus25.
[1924.88 → 1927.10] What's the 25
[1927.10 → 1927.62] stand for?
[1930.42 → 1931.26] I don't know.
[1931.38 → 1932.20] Half the amount
[1932.20 → 1933.10] you'll get off.
[1933.52 → 1934.30] Hopefully it's not
[1934.30 → 1935.26] like a 25%
[1935.26 → 1935.96] off code
[1935.96 → 1937.52] and like my notes
[1937.52 → 1937.96] are wrong
[1937.96 → 1938.48] because it wouldn't
[1938.48 → 1939.16] be the first time
[1939.16 → 1939.94] that we did something
[1939.94 → 1940.62] like that.
[1940.92 → 1941.90] It's just a vestige
[1941.90 → 1942.22] of the previous.
[1942.22 → 1943.36] Let's go find out.
[1943.90 → 1944.16] No,
[1944.38 → 1944.70] no,
[1944.76 → 1945.46] it's all fine.
[1945.60 → 1946.26] It's all good.
[1946.40 → 1947.52] 50% off Synergy
[1947.52 → 1949.06] for LinusTechTips viewers.
[1949.56 → 1950.06] Nine bucks
[1950.06 → 1950.94] to 14 bucks.
[1951.38 → 1951.86] Boom!
[1951.86 → 1953.96] No big deal.
[1954.16 → 1954.64] All right.
[1954.88 → 1955.78] We've got two more
[1955.78 → 1957.06] sponsors for you today.
[1957.30 → 1959.06] First up is actually
[1959.06 → 1960.84] James' favourite sponsor.
[1961.46 → 1961.86] Yes!
[1962.12 → 1963.18] You use these every day,
[1963.26 → 1963.58] don't you?
[1963.74 → 1964.86] I did until you guys
[1964.86 → 1965.48] took them away
[1965.48 → 1966.48] for this ad spot
[1966.48 → 1968.34] and now I don't have
[1968.34 → 1969.30] a pair at my desk anymore.
[1969.54 → 1969.78] Oh,
[1969.96 → 1970.94] you can take one back.
[1971.86 → 1972.80] I don't think these
[1972.80 → 1973.52] are going to work for me.
[1974.74 → 1975.10] Well,
[1975.22 → 1976.04] which ones are yours?
[1976.14 → 1977.46] Do you prefer this one?
[1980.48 → 1981.58] They look better on me,
[1981.66 → 1981.80] man.
[1981.86 → 1982.18] Come on.
[1982.26 → 1983.36] These are the kids' ones.
[1983.50 → 1983.66] So,
[1983.84 → 1984.38] Spectrum.
[1985.08 → 1986.62] Spectrum is the lineup
[1986.62 → 1988.08] of blue light
[1988.08 → 1989.28] filtering glasses
[1989.28 → 1990.00] that makes it
[1990.00 → 1990.64] more comfortable
[1990.64 → 1991.82] to look at
[1991.82 → 1992.98] your monitor all day.
[1993.66 → 1995.04] Using a software solution
[1995.04 → 1996.20] like Flux or Twilight
[1996.20 → 1997.46] does not give you
[1997.46 → 1998.42] the same kind of filtering
[1998.42 → 1999.60] that these glasses do.
[2000.18 → 2001.44] They've got lots
[2001.44 → 2002.46] of different styles
[2002.46 → 2003.24] to choose from.
[2003.36 → 2004.26] Everything from
[2004.26 → 2005.34] like more kind of,
[2005.70 → 2006.58] these are the ones
[2006.58 → 2006.92] you were wearing,
[2007.04 → 2007.12] right?
[2007.14 → 2007.16] No,
[2007.20 → 2007.52] they're not,
[2007.62 → 2008.48] but I think these will work.
[2008.52 → 2008.74] Really?
[2009.32 → 2009.56] Oh,
[2009.64 → 2010.36] where did those go?
[2010.36 → 2011.42] These Wayfarer,
[2011.50 → 2012.54] like thinner framed ones.
[2012.64 → 2012.80] Oh,
[2012.84 → 2013.02] cool.
[2013.44 → 2013.72] All right,
[2013.72 → 2014.50] so everything from
[2014.50 → 2016.00] kind of like a thicker frame
[2016.00 → 2017.64] to kind of like a more fun frame.
[2017.70 → 2019.22] This one has cats on the inside
[2019.22 → 2021.62] to even kid-friendly ones
[2021.62 → 2022.88] that are flexible
[2022.88 → 2024.24] so that they're less likely
[2024.24 → 2025.72] to break them.
[2025.72 → 2027.16] They're primarily focused
[2027.16 → 2027.92] around the Canadian
[2027.92 → 2028.74] and U.S. market
[2028.74 → 2029.46] but they're expanding
[2029.46 → 2029.96] to Europe
[2029.96 → 2031.18] and they ship internationally
[2031.18 → 2032.64] and if you guys check them out
[2032.64 → 2034.24] at spectrumglasses.com
[2034.24 → 2034.92] slash collection
[2034.92 → 2035.78] slash products
[2035.78 → 2037.50] or at the link,
[2037.78 → 2038.00] wait,
[2038.10 → 2038.24] what?
[2038.38 → 2038.70] Dang it.
[2039.36 → 2039.84] There we go.
[2040.06 → 2041.22] Or at the link below,
[2041.58 → 2043.32] you can save 10%
[2043.32 → 2045.26] with offer code Linus.
[2045.50 → 2046.18] I think they're trying
[2046.18 → 2046.84] to break into China
[2046.84 → 2047.48] eventually here.
[2047.82 → 2048.48] You think so?
[2048.78 → 2050.20] I think I heard that.
[2050.60 → 2051.32] Reliable source.
[2051.44 → 2052.32] Are we allowed to say that?
[2053.54 → 2054.92] Are we like disclosing
[2054.92 → 2056.20] in a sponsor spot
[2056.20 → 2057.42] embargoed information
[2057.42 → 2058.04] from a sponsor?
[2058.04 → 2059.36] That kind of stuff's not embargoed.
[2059.54 → 2061.36] Every company wants to go global.
[2062.58 → 2064.84] You better not get us in trouble
[2064.84 → 2066.58] with like your favourite sponsor.
[2066.80 → 2067.66] I'm going to get kicked in the nuts.
[2067.96 → 2068.90] You're killing me here.
[2069.48 → 2070.34] All right.
[2070.72 → 2071.52] Moving on.
[2071.64 → 2072.94] I fix it.
[2073.20 → 2073.60] So,
[2074.00 → 2074.70] I fix it.
[2074.82 → 2075.54] Do they really need
[2075.54 → 2076.58] an introduction at this point?
[2076.70 → 2077.32] Probably not,
[2077.36 → 2077.98] but we'll do it anyway.
[2077.98 → 2078.48] Hey, Alex,
[2078.54 → 2079.04] can I have that
[2079.04 → 2079.86] I fix it kit
[2079.86 → 2081.00] that we were just using
[2081.00 → 2082.28] to complete a project
[2082.28 → 2083.14] that we just did?
[2083.20 → 2084.16] Is that a ProVantage 2?
[2085.40 → 2086.54] There you go, guys.
[2086.54 → 2087.68] I fix it.
[2088.06 → 2089.56] They've got the guides,
[2089.68 → 2090.84] whether it's an iPhone,
[2091.06 → 2091.92] an iMac,
[2092.38 → 2094.26] a Dell computer,
[2094.42 → 2095.26] some other phone.
[2095.36 → 2096.16] If it's a device,
[2096.30 → 2097.36] I fix it's got a guide
[2097.36 → 2098.36] for how to tear it apart
[2098.36 → 2099.60] and sometimes
[2099.60 → 2101.54] how to put it back together.
[2102.26 → 2104.66] And they're also leading the charge
[2104.66 → 2105.70] in terms of
[2105.70 → 2107.34] repair it yourself
[2107.34 → 2108.56] culture
[2108.56 → 2111.24] because they not only provide the guides,
[2111.34 → 2113.18] they also have an extensive range
[2113.18 → 2114.40] of replacement parts
[2114.40 → 2116.52] including really hard to find stuff
[2116.52 → 2118.30] like weird little adhesives
[2118.30 → 2119.08] or gaskets
[2119.08 → 2119.92] that are required
[2119.92 → 2121.60] to put a system back together
[2121.60 → 2123.08] and tools
[2123.08 → 2123.64] like,
[2124.36 → 2125.14] yes, my friends,
[2125.22 → 2126.36] the Protect Toolkit.
[2126.36 → 2128.44] It's now only $59.95
[2128.44 → 2131.16] and includes their 64-bit driver kit
[2131.16 → 2133.38] which has pretty much every bit
[2133.38 → 2134.98] you could possibly need
[2134.98 → 2136.94] and a bunch of other cool stuff
[2136.94 → 2137.92] for prying,
[2138.20 → 2138.56] picking,
[2139.10 → 2139.50] poking,
[2140.24 → 2141.90] anti-static.
[2142.02 → 2143.02] Thank you, Bixby.
[2143.10 → 2144.38] I wasn't talking to you.
[2144.38 → 2145.40] Can I mess with this thing for a sec?
[2145.56 → 2146.28] What, Bixby?
[2146.36 → 2146.66] Yeah.
[2146.90 → 2147.50] No, God, no.
[2147.50 → 2147.66] This thing?
[2150.28 → 2151.16] As a noob,
[2151.30 → 2152.72] I have found two things
[2152.72 → 2153.18] in particular
[2153.18 → 2154.38] that I like about this.
[2154.90 → 2156.62] Yeah, we actually hired a noob
[2156.62 → 2157.18] as a writer.
[2158.40 → 2159.54] Never built a computer before.
[2159.58 → 2160.28] This is kind of a
[2160.34 → 2160.52] yeah,
[2160.62 → 2161.96] well, I was going to kind of get to that
[2161.96 → 2163.22] but it's kind of a funny story
[2163.22 → 2164.14] from his interview.
[2166.10 → 2167.06] One of the questions
[2167.06 → 2167.90] that I asked
[2167.90 → 2169.56] every interviewee
[2169.56 → 2171.14] was,
[2171.88 → 2173.50] tell me about some projects
[2173.50 → 2175.14] that you have on the go right now.
[2175.14 → 2176.14] So, Anthony,
[2176.28 → 2177.00] one of the other writers
[2177.00 → 2178.28] that we hired at the same time,
[2178.44 → 2178.84] he's like,
[2178.88 → 2179.22] oh yeah,
[2179.32 → 2179.46] well,
[2179.52 → 2180.38] I've got all these
[2180.38 → 2181.82] retro consoles
[2181.82 → 2183.54] that I'm repairing
[2183.54 → 2185.36] and soldering back together.
[2186.34 → 2187.46] Alex tells me
[2187.46 → 2188.30] about his
[2188.30 → 2189.98] dune buggy
[2189.98 → 2192.56] creation from scratch team
[2192.56 → 2193.88] that he participated in.
[2193.90 → 2194.40] Mad Max shit,
[2194.46 → 2195.20] probably shoots potatoes
[2195.20 → 2195.68] at the sides.
[2196.62 → 2197.60] James is like,
[2198.08 → 2199.32] I built my own computer.
[2200.16 → 2200.48] No,
[2200.56 → 2201.30] that's not what I said.
[2201.48 → 2201.96] I said,
[2202.10 → 2202.36] okay,
[2202.46 → 2202.58] well,
[2202.70 → 2203.30] what do you mean?
[2203.40 → 2203.58] Like,
[2203.80 → 2204.60] building your own
[2204.60 → 2205.48] computer
[2205.48 → 2206.70] and you said,
[2207.26 → 2207.90] actually,
[2208.00 → 2208.88] I would consider that
[2208.88 → 2209.70] to be pretty basic
[2209.70 → 2210.92] and I was like,
[2210.98 → 2211.22] oh,
[2211.88 → 2212.86] okay,
[2213.40 → 2214.22] hope I make it
[2214.22 → 2215.02] to the next round.
[2216.32 → 2216.46] Yeah,
[2216.56 → 2217.04] so somehow,
[2217.20 → 2217.94] somehow you ended up
[2217.94 → 2218.28] around here.
[2218.36 → 2218.46] Okay,
[2218.54 → 2219.62] so given that perspective,
[2219.74 → 2221.58] I was blown away
[2221.58 → 2222.46] by the fact
[2222.46 → 2223.48] that this puppy spins
[2223.48 → 2224.84] because then you can just
[2224.84 → 2225.58] hold it in one hand
[2225.58 → 2226.42] and as you spin
[2226.42 → 2227.04] and you don't have to
[2227.04 → 2227.60] reset your hand,
[2227.74 → 2228.76] that's just amazing.
[2229.52 → 2230.24] There's so many people
[2230.24 → 2231.18] facepalming right now
[2231.18 → 2232.96] and tool of the week,
[2233.18 → 2233.66] this puppy,
[2233.88 → 2234.60] is this the Spider?
[2235.48 → 2236.22] I actually,
[2236.40 → 2236.80] you know what,
[2236.84 → 2237.72] I'm going to confess.
[2237.92 → 2238.82] They all got cool names.
[2238.92 → 2239.76] I can't remember
[2239.76 → 2240.50] which one's the Spider.
[2240.56 → 2241.36] I think it's the black
[2241.36 → 2241.88] Pokey one.
[2242.80 → 2243.26] I'm pretty sure
[2243.26 → 2243.38] that's the Spider.
[2243.38 → 2244.28] Whatever this is called,
[2245.36 → 2246.12] I'm just going to give it
[2246.12 → 2247.16] a newer name right now.
[2248.16 → 2249.00] I don't know if we're allowed
[2249.00 → 2249.42] to do that.
[2249.42 → 2250.64] I use this thing to just...
[2250.64 → 2251.30] This is the Spider.
[2251.68 → 2252.46] You're going to get us
[2252.46 → 2254.00] in trouble with every sponsor.
[2254.00 → 2254.30] This is so much more Pudgy though.
[2254.76 → 2255.12] Oh,
[2255.68 → 2256.68] why do I let you
[2256.68 → 2257.50] come on this show live?
[2257.78 → 2258.52] I was talking to the
[2258.52 → 2260.06] fixity ladies at LTX
[2260.06 → 2260.94] and we were making
[2260.94 → 2261.68] all sorts of good names
[2261.68 → 2262.14] for these things.
[2262.56 → 2262.98] This should be,
[2263.02 → 2263.70] this is a Pokey.
[2265.36 → 2265.72] Anyway,
[2266.02 → 2267.50] this is great for opening boxes.
[2267.68 → 2268.44] A lot of people who work here
[2268.44 → 2269.58] just have like knives
[2269.58 → 2270.26] on their keychains
[2270.26 → 2271.14] like Linus does,
[2271.22 → 2271.62] Tyler does,
[2271.68 → 2272.68] they unbox things all day.
[2273.22 → 2274.64] I haven't got to that level yet
[2274.64 → 2275.38] because I'm a minimalist.
[2277.12 → 2278.12] On my keychains,
[2278.12 → 2279.50] I actually have a separate
[2279.50 → 2280.90] keychain just for my car key
[2280.90 → 2282.54] and the key that unlocks
[2282.54 → 2283.62] this office.
[2283.96 → 2284.78] That way on the weekend
[2284.78 → 2285.52] I don't have to have
[2285.52 → 2286.38] those extra two keys.
[2286.56 → 2288.84] That's how much I hate
[2288.84 → 2289.76] things being in my pocket.
[2289.88 → 2291.22] So this thing is awesome
[2291.22 → 2292.42] for just opening up
[2292.42 → 2293.16] a new box of fans.
[2294.10 → 2294.62] Love it.
[2294.68 → 2295.74] Totally worth the price of admission.
[2297.02 → 2297.40] Alright,
[2297.56 → 2297.78] well,
[2297.90 → 2299.62] I'm sure that most of you
[2299.62 → 2300.26] will find
[2300.26 → 2302.84] over at iFixit.com
[2302.84 → 2304.18] slash line of 60 bucks.
[2304.38 → 2305.30] I'm sure most of you
[2305.30 → 2306.76] will find more complex things
[2306.76 → 2307.62] to work on with that.
[2308.12 → 2308.94] Speaking of working
[2308.94 → 2309.68] on complex things,
[2309.76 → 2309.94] Alex,
[2310.00 → 2310.72] are you done with that?
[2311.06 → 2311.60] Yeah, I'm done.
[2311.68 → 2312.06] You're done?
[2312.22 → 2312.84] Okay, cool.
[2313.92 → 2314.28] Okay,
[2314.34 → 2314.86] do you want to come on
[2314.86 → 2315.34] and join the show?
[2315.68 → 2316.04] Sure.
[2316.28 → 2316.88] Okay, cool.
[2318.04 → 2318.40] Sweet.
[2318.40 → 2318.54] Alright.
[2319.10 → 2320.18] I actually get to go home.
[2321.62 → 2321.78] Yeah,
[2321.84 → 2322.56] Anthony already left.
[2323.26 → 2323.72] Did he?
[2323.78 → 2324.38] What time is it?
[2324.70 → 2325.18] Oh, wow,
[2325.28 → 2325.64] it's six.
[2325.88 → 2326.18] Oh, well,
[2326.22 → 2327.34] I can't make you join the show,
[2327.44 → 2328.32] but if you want to,
[2328.40 → 2328.84] then you can.
[2329.32 → 2329.58] Otherwise,
[2329.74 → 2330.88] I'll just sit here
[2330.88 → 2331.58] and be a show
[2331.58 → 2332.42] all by myself.
[2332.62 → 2333.40] Bye, everybody.
[2333.78 → 2334.50] Yep, see ya.
[2334.78 → 2335.10] Goodbye.
[2335.10 → 2335.88] I'm DC.
[2336.32 → 2337.22] Have a good weekend.
[2337.78 → 2338.62] Oh, how do I make this?
[2339.04 → 2339.40] It's fine.
[2339.58 → 2340.38] So, Alex,
[2341.08 → 2343.64] do they know who you are?
[2343.76 → 2344.42] I don't know if they know
[2344.42 → 2344.74] who you are.
[2344.92 → 2346.24] I think some of them,
[2346.36 → 2346.56] maybe.
[2346.66 → 2347.32] I'm not totally sure.
[2347.32 → 2350.82] Yeah, Alex is a Toronto Blue Jays fan,
[2350.90 → 2351.12] apparently.
[2351.22 → 2351.80] I actually didn't know.
[2351.80 → 2352.48] You watch baseball?
[2353.28 → 2354.30] When they get into playoffs,
[2354.48 → 2354.74] yes.
[2354.92 → 2355.24] Okay,
[2355.34 → 2358.34] so you're a typical Canadian baseball fan.
[2358.54 → 2358.76] Yeah.
[2359.68 → 2360.12] It's like,
[2360.16 → 2360.30] well,
[2360.34 → 2361.50] we've only got one team
[2361.50 → 2362.38] and,
[2362.42 → 2363.66] gee,
[2363.78 → 2366.34] 182 games is a lot to watch in a year,
[2366.48 → 2366.84] so.
[2367.48 → 2367.74] Yeah.
[2369.20 → 2369.56] Yeah.
[2371.10 → 2372.36] I'd say the same about hockey,
[2372.46 → 2373.52] but being a Toronto fan,
[2373.64 → 2373.84] like,
[2374.04 → 2375.00] then I wouldn't watch a game
[2375.00 → 2375.28] in, like,
[2375.28 → 2376.24] the past 20 years,
[2376.32 → 2376.54] so.
[2377.28 → 2378.16] Are you a Toronto fan?
[2378.28 → 2378.48] Yeah.
[2381.26 → 2381.66] What?
[2383.16 → 2384.26] It's the closest team.
[2384.40 → 2385.28] It is not!
[2385.44 → 2387.34] Montreal is the closest team.
[2387.80 → 2388.56] Montreal is evil, though.
[2388.78 → 2390.02] Not to mention that,
[2390.04 → 2390.38] like,
[2390.68 → 2392.46] anyone else is the closest team
[2392.46 → 2394.16] to being worthy of your fandom.
[2394.76 → 2395.16] I mean,
[2395.30 → 2396.90] that's a factor as well.
[2397.66 → 2398.08] They're just...
[2398.08 → 2398.68] Toronto.
[2399.54 → 2399.92] I don't know.
[2399.98 → 2400.70] I wanted to be a rebel.
[2400.86 → 2401.70] Everyone in my household
[2401.70 → 2402.90] is a Montreal fan,
[2403.02 → 2403.72] and I was just like,
[2404.08 → 2404.46] you know what?
[2404.50 → 2404.68] No.
[2405.28 → 2406.32] I'm being a Toronto fan
[2406.32 → 2407.36] and stirred things up.
[2407.48 → 2407.84] All right.
[2407.90 → 2408.18] Well,
[2408.26 → 2409.30] speaking of fans,
[2409.48 → 2411.62] these CPUs are definitely
[2411.62 → 2412.46] going to need fans
[2412.46 → 2413.68] because they have a lot of cores.
[2414.36 → 2414.72] Wow,
[2414.80 → 2415.64] that was a great segue.
[2416.10 → 2417.12] I still got it, baby.
[2417.12 → 2417.56] So,
[2417.64 → 2419.48] this was posted by EZE on the forum,
[2419.60 → 2420.98] and the original Architect is...
[2420.98 → 2421.78] Architect?
[2422.18 → 2423.92] Articles from over on Nantes.
[2424.36 → 2425.08] Intel launches
[2425.08 → 2426.12] Leon CPUs
[2426.78 → 2428.04] for workstations.
[2429.12 → 2429.68] So,
[2430.04 → 2432.10] there's some good news here.
[2432.10 → 2434.74] The good news is,
[2434.74 → 2435.52] I guess,
[2435.58 → 2436.62] that now,
[2436.74 → 2437.86] on the workstation,
[2438.18 → 2439.34] you can get support
[2439.34 → 2441.10] for up to 512 gigs
[2441.10 → 2442.16] of ECC,
[2442.56 → 2444.22] so that's error-correcting memory.
[2444.22 → 2447.62] It goes all the way
[2447.62 → 2448.62] from 4 cores
[2448.62 → 2450.62] to 18 cores
[2450.62 → 2453.06] in the Leon W family,
[2453.26 → 2454.48] so I guess that's cool.
[2455.88 → 2456.26] So,
[2456.34 → 2457.36] extended memory support,
[2457.50 → 2458.14] V Pro,
[2459.14 → 2460.78] Intel's ANT,
[2461.56 → 2462.58] standard reliability,
[2462.78 → 2463.36] serviceability,
[2463.36 → 2464.96] and availability features.
[2464.96 → 2466.38] So,
[2466.44 → 2467.18] it's good in that
[2467.18 → 2467.54] there's,
[2467.58 → 2467.76] like,
[2467.80 → 2468.84] a higher-end
[2468.84 → 2470.30] workstation platform,
[2470.70 → 2472.58] but it's kind of sucky
[2472.58 → 2473.56] in that,
[2473.84 → 2474.36] basically,
[2474.56 → 2475.80] Intel has gone
[2475.80 → 2476.98] from quite a few
[2476.98 → 2477.92] generations ago
[2477.92 → 2479.96] where LGA 775
[2479.96 → 2481.42] and 771
[2481.42 → 2482.26] were pretty much
[2482.26 → 2483.54] a little piece of tape
[2483.54 → 2484.50] apart,
[2484.98 → 2485.78] and you could kind of,
[2485.78 → 2485.96] like,
[2486.14 → 2488.08] mod one to the other,
[2488.54 → 2489.76] and you could pretty easily
[2489.76 → 2490.66] run sort of
[2490.66 → 2492.26] workstation chips
[2492.26 → 2494.02] in mainstream boards
[2494.02 → 2494.64] and vice versa,
[2494.96 → 2495.84] to now,
[2495.94 → 2496.46] this requires
[2496.46 → 2497.66] an all-new chipset,
[2498.08 → 2499.44] and we've got
[2499.44 → 2500.08] sort of their
[2500.08 → 2502.94] enterprise server Eons,
[2503.30 → 2504.70] we've got consumer,
[2505.02 → 2505.56] and then we've got
[2505.56 → 2506.22] this in-between,
[2506.84 → 2508.18] and there's not a lot
[2508.18 → 2509.16] of interchangeability
[2509.16 → 2510.08] in spite of the fact
[2510.08 → 2511.12] that there's really
[2511.12 → 2512.96] no compelling reason
[2512.96 → 2514.30] for why that would
[2514.30 → 2515.74] have to be physically.
[2516.68 → 2517.12] Yeah,
[2517.16 → 2517.28] like,
[2517.32 → 2517.94] 1366,
[2518.18 → 2518.62] you could just
[2518.62 → 2520.00] take N9-7
[2520.00 → 2521.20] and plop in a Leon
[2521.20 → 2521.54] and, like,
[2521.56 → 2522.16] it wouldn't even matter,
[2522.22 → 2522.40] right?
[2523.46 → 2523.90] Yep.
[2523.90 → 2524.76] In fact,
[2525.00 → 2527.24] I mean,
[2527.42 → 2529.22] running server-grade
[2529.22 → 2530.74] processors in consumer
[2530.74 → 2531.28] motherboards
[2531.28 → 2532.32] is something that
[2532.32 → 2533.86] I have personally done.
[2534.32 → 2534.58] Like,
[2534.66 → 2535.38] back in the day
[2535.38 → 2537.36] with my Option 165
[2537.36 → 2538.46] on socket 939.
[2539.02 → 2539.76] The great thing
[2539.76 → 2541.22] about the Option 165
[2541.22 → 2541.98] is that it was,
[2542.02 → 2542.80] it was a good value
[2542.80 → 2543.62] because it ran
[2543.62 → 2544.86] at a super low clock speed,
[2545.02 → 2545.30] but,
[2545.54 → 2546.18] by putting it
[2546.18 → 2547.08] in a consumer board,
[2547.16 → 2547.78] you could overclock
[2547.78 → 2548.56] the stuffing out of it
[2548.56 → 2549.06] and you could get
[2549.06 → 2549.86] great performance
[2549.86 → 2550.30] per dollar.
[2550.56 → 2551.30] This is just
[2551.30 → 2552.56] artificially locking
[2552.56 → 2554.46] down the performance
[2554.46 → 2555.10] per dollar that's
[2555.10 → 2555.42] available
[2555.42 → 2557.38] and just,
[2557.60 → 2557.82] you know,
[2557.94 → 2558.50] there you go.
[2558.72 → 2559.46] With that said,
[2559.86 → 2560.44] I don't think
[2560.44 → 2561.24] there's really any,
[2561.40 → 2561.66] um,
[2561.90 → 2562.64] I think it's,
[2562.74 → 2563.36] okay,
[2563.78 → 2564.94] I guess Intel's
[2564.94 → 2566.04] other behaviour
[2566.04 → 2567.08] over the last little while
[2567.08 → 2568.26] has made it less of a factor
[2568.26 → 2569.08] because it's not like
[2569.08 → 2569.84] anything that's not
[2569.84 → 2570.96] an X or a K-SQ
[2570.96 → 2572.54] is overclockable anyway,
[2572.54 → 2573.76] and these chips
[2573.76 → 2574.40] are going to come in
[2574.40 → 2575.26] more expensive
[2575.26 → 2576.30] than the equivalent
[2576.30 → 2577.82] core i's anyhow,
[2578.14 → 2578.86] so there would be,
[2579.44 → 2580.80] other than the second-hand market,
[2580.92 → 2581.86] no compelling reason
[2581.86 → 2582.96] to go and buy one of these
[2582.96 → 2583.68] if you don't need
[2583.68 → 2584.82] ECC memory support.
[2586.22 → 2586.82] And also,
[2586.92 → 2587.78] there's that they just have,
[2588.42 → 2589.32] is it functionally
[2589.32 → 2590.26] any different from i9
[2590.26 → 2592.26] or they're just locking you out
[2592.26 → 2593.60] in many different ways
[2593.60 → 2594.56] for different markets?
[2594.70 → 2594.90] No,
[2594.94 → 2595.94] it actually really
[2595.94 → 2597.06] doesn't look that different,
[2597.24 → 2598.42] so if you go ahead
[2598.42 → 2599.04] and have a look
[2599.04 → 2599.82] at the lineup here,
[2599.92 → 2600.50] let's go ahead
[2600.50 → 2601.32] and go down.
[2601.80 → 2602.30] So here you go,
[2602.30 → 2602.86] here's how they're
[2602.86 → 2603.80] differentiating it.
[2604.08 → 2605.46] There's Expert,
[2605.88 → 2607.04] Leon Scalable,
[2607.28 → 2607.64] so this,
[2607.88 → 2609.12] the equivalent used to be
[2609.12 → 2610.54] the E5-2600,
[2610.70 → 2611.52] so this is what we would
[2611.52 → 2612.40] have used for projects
[2612.40 → 2613.74] like 7Gamers1 CPU
[2613.74 → 2615.18] in like dual socket
[2615.18 → 2615.70] motherboards,
[2615.78 → 2616.36] that kind of thing.
[2616.86 → 2617.56] Leon W
[2617.56 → 2619.76] is what would have been
[2619.76 → 2621.36] E5-1600,
[2622.02 → 2623.84] and then Leon E3
[2623.84 → 2624.70] is entry,
[2624.84 → 2625.98] so this would probably be
[2625.98 → 2626.68] what would have
[2626.68 → 2627.70] previously been
[2627.70 → 2629.34] like LGA-1150,
[2629.60 → 2631.02] 11-5X Eons,
[2631.02 → 2632.48] where you don't actually
[2632.48 → 2633.46] get like the quad channel
[2633.46 → 2634.70] memory or anything like that,
[2634.74 → 2635.68] you just get ECC.
[2636.94 → 2637.34] So,
[2637.48 → 2639.30] AVX5-12 acceleration,
[2640.82 → 2641.12] up to,
[2641.22 → 2641.58] yep,
[2641.68 → 2641.90] okay,
[2642.02 → 2642.38] so yeah,
[2642.46 → 2643.28] pretty much you get
[2643.28 → 2644.04] a four,
[2644.70 → 2645.84] a couple four cores,
[2645.90 → 2646.64] a couple six cores,
[2646.74 → 2646.90] an eight,
[2646.90 → 2647.10] a ten,
[2647.10 → 2647.48] a 14,
[2647.48 → 2648.10] and an 18.
[2648.10 → 2650.14] one thing I don't know
[2650.14 → 2651.74] is how these base frequencies
[2651.74 → 2652.58] and turbo frequencies
[2652.58 → 2654.08] compare to the Core i's,
[2654.20 → 2656.00] and pricing is still unclear,
[2656.42 → 2657.90] but what we can at least
[2657.90 → 2658.94] kind of figure out
[2658.94 → 2660.24] is that this looks
[2660.24 → 2661.16] pretty darn similar
[2661.16 → 2662.54] to the 7900X,
[2663.04 → 2665.22] and it is another $440
[2665.22 → 2666.84] for pretty much those,
[2666.84 → 2668.22] you know,
[2668.32 → 2669.28] enterprise features
[2669.28 → 2670.20] and ECC memory.
[2670.64 → 2670.76] Well,
[2670.78 → 2671.16] in fairness,
[2671.50 → 2672.32] the...
[2672.32 → 2672.86] and you don't get
[2672.86 → 2673.72] overclocking anymore,
[2673.78 → 2674.16] I'm assuming.
[2674.48 → 2675.84] 21.25 actually
[2675.84 → 2676.84] doesn't look that horrible.
[2677.72 → 2677.90] Yeah,
[2677.92 → 2678.98] but why would you buy
[2678.98 → 2680.94] a quad-core at $400?
[2681.32 → 2682.22] This is basically,
[2682.44 → 2682.66] what,
[2682.76 → 2682.98] a
[2683.88 → 2684.02] well,
[2684.08 → 2685.40] how much is a 7700K?
[2685.42 → 2686.86] A 7740K,
[2687.66 → 2687.96] right?
[2688.58 → 2689.78] And a 7740K
[2689.78 → 2690.46] can be had for
[2690.46 → 2691.40] cheaper than that,
[2691.48 → 2692.48] and it's overclockable.
[2693.24 → 2693.68] And,
[2693.76 → 2694.62] I wouldn't run out
[2694.62 → 2696.30] and invest in this kind of,
[2696.36 → 2696.50] like,
[2696.56 → 2698.24] an LGA 2066 platform
[2698.24 → 2700.16] for a quad-core processor.
[2700.28 → 2700.78] That's just,
[2700.94 → 2701.14] like,
[2701.14 → 2703.32] kind of dumb.
[2703.52 → 2703.70] Yeah,
[2703.74 → 2703.86] it's,
[2703.92 → 2704.00] like,
[2704.00 → 2704.76] not too bad
[2704.76 → 2705.32] if you're
[2705.32 → 2706.50] in a situation
[2706.50 → 2706.92] that you're never
[2706.92 → 2707.54] going to have.
[2707.78 → 2708.12] Yeah.
[2709.26 → 2709.68] So,
[2709.76 → 2710.22] that's kind of
[2710.22 → 2711.04] where we're at on that.
[2712.06 → 2712.44] Actually,
[2712.52 → 2712.62] oh,
[2712.66 → 2713.20] this is cool.
[2713.36 → 2713.56] So,
[2713.82 → 2715.28] Ian from Nantes
[2715.28 → 2715.76] went ahead
[2715.76 → 2716.32] and did a little
[2716.32 → 2717.36] comparison chart here.
[2718.16 → 2718.40] So,
[2718.84 → 2719.18] 70,
[2719.42 → 2720.82] here's a comparison
[2720.82 → 2722.24] between the top SKUs
[2722.24 → 2723.26] on each platform.
[2723.38 → 2723.50] So,
[2723.56 → 2724.76] the super high-end one,
[2725.42 → 2727.18] which actually
[2727.18 → 2728.28] now gets a new socket.
[2728.56 → 2728.72] So,
[2728.80 → 2729.40] that allows it
[2729.40 → 2729.88] to have
[2729.88 → 2731.04] more cores,
[2731.14 → 2732.80] more PCIe thread,
[2733.08 → 2734.00] excuse me,
[2734.08 → 2734.20] no,
[2734.28 → 2735.56] no more PCIe lanes,
[2735.98 → 2737.36] but far more cores,
[2737.44 → 2738.64] up to 28 cores
[2738.64 → 2739.72] and 56 threads,
[2740.08 → 2741.64] and six-channel memory.
[2742.36 → 2743.76] That one's going to cost you
[2743.76 → 2744.52] anywhere from $10,000
[2744.52 → 2745.86] to $13,000.
[2746.42 → 2747.44] That's quite the price.
[2747.66 → 2748.42] $8180.
[2748.42 → 2749.60] And then,
[2749.60 → 2751.92] on the high-end workstation
[2751.92 → 2754.24] slash high-end desktop platforms,
[2754.44 → 2755.54] you're looking at
[2755.54 → 2757.64] $2,000 TBD,
[2757.78 → 2758.58] but if I had to guess,
[2758.64 → 2759.40] I'd probably say around
[2759.40 → 2760.56] $3,000 or $3,500.
[2761.14 → 2763.02] You get a few more PCIe lanes,
[2763.26 → 2764.28] so the same as the
[2764.28 → 2765.30] very high-end Eons,
[2765.62 → 2766.52] and then you get
[2766.52 → 2767.82] very similar clock speeds.
[2767.90 → 2768.14] Actually,
[2768.20 → 2769.16] a little bit more on boost,
[2769.22 → 2770.40] a little bit less on base,
[2771.00 → 2772.92] and a lower TDP,
[2773.16 → 2775.88] and then more memory support
[2775.88 → 2777.02] and registered memory support.
[2777.20 → 2777.32] So,
[2778.46 → 2778.80] yeah,
[2778.92 → 2779.26] I can,
[2779.50 → 2781.50] I guess that's a thing.
[2781.58 → 2782.22] Why don't we move on?
[2782.64 → 2782.80] Yeah.
[2784.50 → 2785.84] So are we still on Intel?
[2786.10 → 2786.38] Yeah,
[2786.56 → 2788.64] Core i7 8700K benchmarks
[2788.64 → 2790.02] have been leaked.
[2790.72 → 2791.94] This was posted originally
[2791.94 → 2793.04] on the forum by,
[2793.14 → 2793.76] I'm not sure,
[2793.90 → 2796.10] James forgot to put that in.
[2796.22 → 2796.38] Oh,
[2796.42 → 2797.52] I wish I had gotten to this one
[2797.52 → 2798.14] when he was here.
[2798.64 → 2800.24] This was posted by Raven Shrike
[2800.24 → 2800.84] on the forum,
[2800.94 → 2802.06] and the original article here
[2802.06 → 2803.58] is from WCCF Tech.
[2804.12 → 2804.48] Goodness.
[2806.28 → 2808.26] So this is a really,
[2808.70 → 2810.84] fascinating chip,
[2811.34 → 2813.48] because word on the street,
[2814.28 → 2815.16] according to,
[2815.26 → 2815.56] you know,
[2815.64 → 2817.74] the leaked box art here,
[2818.28 → 2820.98] and the leaked benchmarks here,
[2821.22 → 2823.28] is that per core clock speed
[2823.28 → 2823.86] and performance
[2823.86 → 2825.70] is going to be pretty
[2825.70 → 2827.48] freaking similar
[2827.48 → 2829.66] to the CPU that it's replacing,
[2829.66 → 2831.08] the 7700K,
[2831.56 → 2832.60] except that it's going to have
[2832.60 → 2833.46] six cores
[2833.46 → 2835.34] on what will presumably be
[2835.34 → 2837.24] a similarly priced
[2837.24 → 2838.72] mainstream motherboard
[2838.72 → 2839.96] and chipset platform.
[2840.50 → 2841.18] Six cores!
[2841.78 → 2842.26] Mainstream!
[2843.26 → 2844.16] I'm excited.
[2844.44 → 2845.42] Intel ran out
[2845.42 → 2847.08] and finally delivered us
[2847.08 → 2848.70] a high-end desktop platform
[2848.70 → 2849.70] worth writing home about,
[2850.24 → 2851.30] and then went
[2851.30 → 2852.18] and made it irrelevant
[2852.18 → 2853.60] to the vast majority
[2853.60 → 2854.26] of consumers
[2854.26 → 2856.28] for whom six cores
[2856.28 → 2857.10] is like definitely
[2857.10 → 2858.00] super enough
[2858.00 → 2860.54] only a few months later.
[2861.50 → 2861.98] It's exciting!
[2862.48 → 2863.22] It's a great time
[2863.22 → 2863.92] to be alive!
[2864.26 → 2865.30] What do we get here?
[2865.82 → 2866.72] What are the leaked specs?
[2867.60 → 2869.94] So it's a 3.7 gigahertz
[2869.94 → 2870.70] base frequency
[2870.70 → 2872.12] with boosts up to,
[2872.64 → 2873.78] well, the only fascinating one
[2873.78 → 2874.98] is 4.7 gigahertz
[2874.98 → 2875.62] on one core.
[2875.88 → 2876.06] So like...
[2876.06 → 2876.88] You think that's the only
[2876.88 → 2877.50] interesting one?
[2877.88 → 2879.88] I am going to argue with you.
[2880.52 → 2882.76] I think the 4.5 gigahertz
[2882.76 → 2883.70] two core boost
[2883.70 → 2885.06] is actually more important
[2885.06 → 2886.44] with how many games
[2886.44 → 2887.18] these days
[2887.18 → 2888.68] are taking advantage
[2888.68 → 2889.70] of two cores.
[2891.00 → 2891.76] That's the same
[2891.76 → 2893.34] as the 7700K, isn't it?
[2894.12 → 2894.88] Yeah, I think so.
[2894.94 → 2896.38] But the word on the street, though,
[2896.40 → 2896.96] is that we're looking
[2896.96 → 2898.52] at a 10% IPC improvement.
[2899.28 → 2900.12] So this thing
[2900.12 → 2901.52] could show up
[2901.52 → 2903.16] and absolutely kick
[2903.16 → 2904.38] the stuffing
[2904.38 → 2906.20] out of the computer
[2906.20 → 2906.86] that anyone
[2906.86 → 2908.98] who, any chumps out there
[2908.98 → 2909.88] who ran out
[2909.88 → 2911.24] and bought a 7700K,
[2912.06 → 2912.90] it could be like
[2912.90 → 2914.06] the old days
[2914.06 → 2915.56] where every generation
[2915.56 → 2916.70] we had this
[2916.70 → 2917.72] deep buyer's remorse
[2917.72 → 2918.52] and we felt like
[2918.52 → 2919.54] there was actually
[2919.54 → 2920.82] enough of a performance
[2920.82 → 2921.44] improvement
[2921.44 → 2922.68] to be worth
[2922.68 → 2923.94] going out there
[2923.94 → 2925.22] and buying a new one.
[2925.98 → 2927.14] So, word on the street
[2927.14 → 2928.40] is that it's going to cost
[2928.40 → 2930.22] 350 bucks
[2930.22 → 2930.92] when it launches,
[2931.66 → 2931.96] but...
[2931.96 → 2932.16] Wow.
[2932.16 → 2934.16] With a 10% IPC improvement,
[2934.72 → 2936.20] similar clock speeds,
[2936.20 → 2937.04] so you're looking
[2937.04 → 2937.90] at 10% faster
[2937.90 → 2938.68] right out of the gate,
[2939.20 → 2939.94] plus
[2939.94 → 2941.70] that it could be
[2941.70 → 2942.96] up to 50%
[2942.96 → 2944.02] faster
[2944.02 → 2944.68] in heavily
[2944.68 → 2945.70] multithreaded
[2945.70 → 2946.52] benchmarks
[2946.52 → 2948.08] and applications,
[2948.42 → 2948.74] I mean,
[2948.82 → 2950.26] this thing could show up
[2950.26 → 2951.78] and be legitimately
[2951.78 → 2954.16] like 140%
[2954.16 → 2955.44] in the real world,
[2955.60 → 2956.10] 140,
[2956.22 → 2957.04] 150%
[2957.04 → 2957.66] the speed
[2957.66 → 2959.14] of a 7700K
[2959.14 → 2959.74] in something like
[2959.74 → 2960.38] video encoding.
[2960.38 → 2963.56] And I guess also
[2963.56 → 2964.52] that's really
[2964.52 → 2965.58] bad news for AMD
[2965.58 → 2967.36] because that's kind of
[2967.36 → 2969.66] their buttery zone
[2969.66 → 2970.08] right now
[2970.08 → 2970.48] where they're like,
[2970.56 → 2971.72] we have many cores.
[2972.26 → 2973.52] It is going to put
[2973.52 → 2974.14] some pressure
[2974.14 → 2975.38] on Ry zen 7.
[2975.54 → 2976.40] With that said,
[2976.96 → 2977.26] I mean,
[2977.36 → 2978.88] AMD has shown
[2978.88 → 2980.34] a definite willingness
[2980.34 → 2981.58] to roll up
[2981.58 → 2982.28] their sleeves,
[2982.82 → 2983.00] like,
[2983.06 → 2983.92] they're rolling up
[2983.92 → 2984.36] the sleeves
[2984.36 → 2984.92] all the way
[2984.92 → 2985.40] to the point
[2985.40 → 2985.94] where like...
[2985.94 → 2986.80] You're so white.
[2986.88 → 2987.56] Oh my god.
[2987.56 → 2993.18] Roll up the sleeves
[2993.18 → 2994.48] all the way
[2994.48 → 2995.26] to the point
[2995.26 → 2996.88] where there's
[2996.88 → 2997.50] no sleeves
[2997.50 → 2998.26] left anymore
[2998.26 → 2998.90] when it comes
[2998.90 → 2999.50] to adding more
[2999.50 → 3000.54] cores to CPUs
[3000.54 → 3001.56] just because YOLO.
[3002.08 → 3002.34] And also,
[3002.42 → 3002.98] they probably have
[3002.98 → 3003.70] a lot left over
[3003.70 → 3004.36] like in the tank
[3004.36 → 3004.88] for Ry zen.
[3005.14 → 3005.22] Like,
[3006.52 → 3006.88] hopefully,
[3007.12 → 3007.86] as they continue
[3007.86 → 3008.72] to improve it,
[3008.78 → 3009.14] we'll see
[3009.14 → 3010.72] just generally
[3010.72 → 3011.44] it being better.
[3011.56 → 3011.78] Well,
[3011.78 → 3013.52] when Jim Keller
[3013.52 → 3014.46] left AMD,
[3014.72 → 3015.62] so he left
[3015.62 → 3016.26] for Tesla,
[3016.44 → 3017.42] if I recall correctly,
[3017.56 → 3018.38] so he left AMD
[3018.38 → 3019.10] to go to Apple,
[3019.26 → 3019.88] then he left Apple
[3019.88 → 3020.76] to go back to AMD
[3020.76 → 3021.30] to like,
[3021.56 → 3022.22] rescue them
[3022.22 → 3023.24] as far as I can tell,
[3023.42 → 3024.20] and then left
[3024.20 → 3024.80] to go to Tesla.
[3024.96 → 3026.18] AMD made it very clear
[3026.18 → 3027.76] that his departure
[3027.76 → 3028.76] did not mean
[3028.76 → 3029.38] the end
[3029.38 → 3030.38] of the Zen architecture.
[3030.56 → 3030.68] Like,
[3030.72 → 3031.52] Zen 2.0
[3031.52 → 3032.16] is already
[3032.16 → 3033.22] mapped out,
[3033.56 → 3034.54] is my understanding.
[3034.78 → 3035.04] So,
[3036.58 → 3037.42] we already went
[3037.42 → 3038.04] through that topic,
[3038.18 → 3038.48] we already went
[3038.48 → 3038.96] through that topic,
[3039.02 → 3039.40] we already went
[3039.40 → 3040.04] through that topic.
[3040.90 → 3042.24] Galaxy Note 7 owners
[3042.24 → 3042.70] will apparently
[3042.70 → 3043.66] get a massive discount
[3043.66 → 3044.30] on the Note 8,
[3044.76 → 3045.32] so that's cool.
[3045.78 → 3046.32] Goodbye, Nick.
[3046.44 → 3046.80] Bye, Nick.
[3046.80 → 3047.72] Have a good long ago.
[3048.12 → 3048.38] Oh,
[3048.54 → 3050.00] I was so upset
[3050.00 → 3050.78] about this topic.
[3050.88 → 3051.38] This was posted
[3051.38 → 3052.02] by MiniBeats
[3052.02 → 3052.54] on the forum.
[3052.66 → 3053.34] The original article
[3053.34 → 3054.58] here is from PC Gamer.
[3054.64 → 3055.00] You guys should
[3055.00 → 3055.58] go check it out.
[3056.14 → 3056.60] Why are you upset
[3056.60 → 3057.12] by that one?
[3057.46 → 3058.62] I'm upset
[3058.62 → 3059.64] because it never
[3059.64 → 3060.60] got released.
[3060.60 → 3063.68] I liked the Nvidia Shield
[3063.68 → 3064.24] portable.
[3064.24 → 3065.44] Really?
[3065.44 → 3066.64] And a prototype...
[3066.64 → 3070.06] Alright,
[3070.24 → 3071.70] choose your words carefully,
[3072.06 → 3072.40] Mr.
[3072.56 → 3073.84] Enjoys being employed here.
[3075.28 → 3076.54] I just never really
[3076.54 → 3077.40] saw the appeal of it.
[3078.20 → 3079.40] What's not to like?
[3079.70 → 3081.78] It's a handheld console
[3081.78 → 3084.50] that plays Android games
[3084.50 → 3085.04] and that streams
[3085.04 → 3086.02] your PC games.
[3086.02 → 3088.04] So,
[3088.28 → 3089.00] Android games
[3089.00 → 3089.82] are never great
[3089.82 → 3091.20] and PC games
[3091.20 → 3092.06] are only best played
[3092.06 → 3092.60] on a PC.
[3095.80 → 3097.44] What about PC platformers?
[3097.80 → 3098.10] Yeah,
[3098.26 → 3099.02] what about...
[3099.02 → 3099.28] Okay,
[3099.36 → 3100.14] I played through
[3100.14 → 3101.92] all of Tomb Raider
[3101.92 → 3103.30] on the Nvidia Shield.
[3103.72 → 3104.46] Whole game.
[3104.88 → 3105.88] Never felt like
[3105.88 → 3106.50] I was having
[3106.50 → 3107.50] a bad experience
[3107.50 → 3108.26] and the graphics
[3108.26 → 3109.44] were freaking awesome
[3109.44 → 3109.94] because it's
[3109.94 → 3110.84] a portable platform.
[3110.84 → 3112.82] Okay,
[3113.02 → 3113.98] but...
[3113.98 → 3114.58] And you can't say...
[3114.58 → 3115.28] I did not enjoy
[3115.28 → 3116.04] Tomb Raider at all.
[3116.12 → 3116.70] I like played a bit
[3116.70 → 3117.12] of it and was like,
[3117.20 → 3117.40] eh.
[3117.68 → 3118.44] GTA 5.
[3118.94 → 3119.16] Yeah,
[3119.34 → 3119.48] there,
[3119.60 → 3119.80] fine,
[3119.88 → 3120.48] GTA 5.
[3120.54 → 3120.92] Who cares?
[3121.68 → 3122.42] Any game
[3122.42 → 3123.10] that plays well
[3123.10 → 3123.76] with a controller
[3123.76 → 3124.92] played great
[3124.92 → 3126.44] on the Shield
[3126.44 → 3126.92] portable.
[3127.94 → 3128.82] And basically,
[3129.04 → 3129.22] yeah,
[3129.36 → 3130.50] this prototype
[3130.50 → 3131.82] which looks like
[3131.82 → 3132.36] it has some
[3132.36 → 3133.62] seriously awesome
[3133.62 → 3134.28] improvements,
[3134.78 → 3135.96] smaller bezels,
[3136.06 → 3136.48] that was like
[3136.48 → 3137.70] one of the few things
[3137.70 → 3138.54] that I really felt like
[3138.54 → 3139.42] had to be fixed.
[3139.42 → 3140.50] They changed some
[3140.50 → 3141.48] of the button placements.
[3141.58 → 3142.18] It looks a bit more
[3142.18 → 3143.00] ergonomic.
[3144.38 → 3144.82] Oh,
[3144.94 → 3145.58] man!
[3147.64 → 3149.54] Just one prototype
[3149.54 → 3150.88] made it into the wild
[3150.88 → 3152.22] and that's it.
[3152.76 → 3153.46] I even sent,
[3153.74 → 3154.66] like, and I...
[3154.66 → 3155.44] Shield portable
[3155.44 → 3155.92] was something
[3155.92 → 3156.86] that I would send
[3156.86 → 3158.16] fairly frequent
[3158.16 → 3159.26] sort of pings
[3159.26 → 3160.16] to our Nvidia rep
[3160.16 → 3160.52] about like,
[3160.58 → 3160.68] hey,
[3160.74 → 3161.30] when are you guys,
[3161.42 → 3161.64] like,
[3162.54 → 3163.34] doing a thing
[3163.34 → 3164.22] that's a new thing
[3164.22 → 3164.64] because, like,
[3164.68 → 3165.04] there's kind of
[3165.04 → 3166.08] an old processor now
[3166.08 → 3166.78] and they just
[3166.78 → 3167.98] never replied
[3167.98 → 3168.98] and never replied.
[3169.42 → 3172.02] And it made me sad.
[3172.16 → 3172.96] Screen was apparently
[3172.96 → 3173.50] brighter.
[3174.02 → 3174.96] It shut down instantly
[3174.96 → 3175.58] instead of taking
[3175.58 → 3176.40] a couple seconds.
[3177.40 → 3178.82] And, yeah,
[3178.96 → 3180.28] so I'm sad.
[3180.36 → 3180.60] Apparently,
[3180.70 → 3181.68] nobody else is sad.
[3182.54 → 3183.02] Yeah,
[3183.08 → 3183.86] I couldn't care less,
[3183.92 → 3184.12] really.
[3185.04 → 3185.32] Well,
[3185.88 → 3188.26] thanks.
[3190.64 → 3191.60] Speaking of things
[3191.60 → 3193.22] that we couldn't
[3193.22 → 3193.82] care less about,
[3193.90 → 3194.16] actually,
[3194.26 → 3194.84] this does seem
[3194.84 → 3195.42] kind of important.
[3195.42 → 3196.76] YouTube begins
[3196.76 → 3197.96] isolating offensive
[3197.96 → 3198.70] content
[3198.70 → 3200.62] this week.
[3201.24 → 3202.12] They won't be able
[3202.12 → 3203.04] to run ads
[3203.04 → 3203.58] or,
[3203.66 → 3204.46] and this is interesting,
[3204.68 → 3205.28] be shared
[3205.28 → 3206.64] on other websites.
[3207.72 → 3208.10] So,
[3208.44 → 3209.20] Google announced
[3209.20 → 3209.86] this in June,
[3209.96 → 3210.26] that they would
[3210.26 → 3210.94] begin isolating
[3210.94 → 3211.60] YouTube videos
[3211.60 → 3212.32] that weren't
[3212.32 → 3213.80] directly in violation
[3213.80 → 3214.44] of its standards
[3214.44 → 3215.10] but contained
[3215.10 → 3215.88] controversial
[3215.88 → 3216.34] religious
[3216.34 → 3217.44] or supremacist
[3217.44 → 3218.00] content.
[3218.80 → 3219.32] So,
[3219.40 → 3219.72] the videos
[3219.72 → 3220.14] that fall
[3220.14 → 3221.02] into this category,
[3221.32 → 3222.62] aside from not
[3222.62 → 3223.16] being able to run
[3223.16 → 3224.16] ads or be monetized,
[3224.16 → 3225.80] won't have comments
[3225.80 → 3226.44] disabled,
[3226.70 → 3227.84] and may have
[3227.84 → 3228.72] a warning screen
[3228.72 → 3230.00] appear before they play.
[3230.28 → 3230.98] This is meant
[3230.98 → 3232.42] to curtail engagement
[3232.42 → 3233.64] and minimize
[3233.64 → 3234.78] the video's reach.
[3235.32 → 3235.66] So,
[3235.74 → 3236.42] creators affected
[3236.42 → 3237.08] by the policy
[3237.08 → 3238.12] will receive a note
[3238.12 → 3239.10] and will be able
[3239.10 → 3240.02] to appeal the decision
[3240.02 → 3240.74] if they feel like
[3240.74 → 3241.28] the restrictions
[3241.28 → 3242.82] are unwarranted.
[3244.52 → 3245.04] Well,
[3245.04 → 3245.18] I guess,
[3245.26 → 3245.64] first,
[3245.70 → 3246.66] how do they flag it?
[3246.76 → 3247.42] Because I know
[3247.42 → 3249.04] their last rollout
[3249.04 → 3249.84] went horribly.
[3250.48 → 3250.66] Well,
[3250.66 → 3250.70] yeah.
[3250.70 → 3251.18] And a lot of people
[3251.18 → 3252.62] got falsely flagged.
[3252.80 → 3253.06] Yeah.
[3253.06 → 3254.00] So,
[3254.06 → 3254.36] if they're able
[3254.36 → 3255.40] to improve that a bit,
[3255.48 → 3256.98] that's an improvement,
[3257.10 → 3257.40] I guess,
[3257.54 → 3258.02] but...
[3258.02 → 3259.22] Let's see how it goes
[3259.22 → 3260.32] is all I have to say
[3260.32 → 3260.78] about that.
[3262.24 → 3262.60] Yeah,
[3262.62 → 3263.30] I don't have high hopes
[3263.30 → 3263.74] for that.
[3264.32 → 3264.68] And,
[3265.42 → 3266.14] what was the other thing
[3266.14 → 3267.02] that I was going to say
[3267.02 → 3267.76] about this?
[3268.46 → 3269.64] It also seems like
[3269.64 → 3270.16] it's going to have
[3270.16 → 3270.72] a lot of people
[3270.72 → 3271.38] that are just saying,
[3271.60 → 3271.66] like,
[3272.34 → 3272.96] oh,
[3273.10 → 3273.90] they're just trying
[3273.90 → 3274.20] to, like,
[3274.22 → 3275.04] hurt my free speech
[3275.04 → 3275.84] and then they might
[3275.84 → 3277.12] almost get more
[3277.12 → 3278.54] shares out of
[3278.54 → 3279.06] being like,
[3279.14 → 3279.78] my free speech
[3279.78 → 3280.14] is hurt
[3280.14 → 3281.14] as opposed to
[3281.14 → 3283.48] just not being
[3283.48 → 3285.02] no one really caring.
[3285.36 → 3285.98] All right,
[3286.04 → 3286.72] so let's move on
[3286.72 → 3287.12] from that
[3287.12 → 3287.76] to something
[3287.76 → 3289.76] completely uncontroversial.
[3290.76 → 3291.72] I just wanted to check,
[3291.78 → 3292.24] I haven't checked
[3292.24 → 3292.92] the document yet.
[3293.12 → 3293.58] Do you guys have
[3293.58 → 3294.52] the Juicer news?
[3295.02 → 3295.96] The Juicer news?
[3296.30 → 3296.52] No.
[3296.64 → 3296.88] Did you see it?
[3296.96 → 3297.28] No.
[3298.08 → 3298.48] Oh,
[3298.56 → 3299.66] I did hear about this,
[3299.74 → 3299.88] though.
[3299.94 → 3300.36] I thought,
[3300.66 → 3301.24] you know what?
[3301.24 → 3302.72] I think James
[3302.72 → 3303.98] specifically asked me
[3303.98 → 3304.54] if I wanted
[3304.54 → 3305.50] the Juicer news
[3305.50 → 3305.96] in here.
[3306.88 → 3307.28] Oh,
[3307.32 → 3307.86] they're shutting down.
[3309.10 → 3310.64] And I specifically
[3310.64 → 3311.72] told him yes.
[3314.72 → 3315.38] I don't know
[3315.38 → 3315.84] how to spell
[3315.84 → 3316.40] Juicer.
[3318.92 → 3319.74] I think you mean
[3319.74 → 3320.38] J-U-I,
[3320.48 → 3320.94] but sure.
[3321.88 → 3322.84] J-U-I.
[3323.22 → 3323.62] Yeah,
[3323.70 → 3323.80] no,
[3323.84 → 3324.66] he didn't put it in.
[3324.74 → 3324.94] Okay,
[3325.04 → 3325.40] so hold on,
[3325.44 → 3325.96] let's go grab,
[3326.06 → 3326.60] let's go grab
[3326.60 → 3327.26] an article here.
[3327.32 → 3328.34] Here's Verge's article.
[3329.42 → 3330.56] Juicer is shutting
[3330.56 → 3331.06] down.
[3331.24 → 3332.24] Apparently,
[3333.34 → 3333.58] they're trying
[3333.58 → 3334.14] to get bought.
[3335.78 → 3336.96] So that's pretty cool.
[3337.72 → 3338.54] I'm so surprised
[3338.54 → 3339.02] that they're shutting
[3339.02 → 3339.60] down and said
[3339.60 → 3340.26] no one ever.
[3341.38 → 3342.16] All customers
[3342.16 → 3343.34] have up to 90 days
[3343.34 → 3344.28] to request a refund
[3344.28 → 3345.00] for their purchase
[3345.00 → 3346.14] of the Juicer press,
[3346.32 → 3347.74] regardless of when
[3347.74 → 3348.40] they bought it.
[3349.50 → 3350.32] Employees are being
[3350.32 → 3351.68] given 60 days notice.
[3355.90 → 3356.30] So,
[3356.46 → 3356.60] like,
[3356.68 → 3357.06] have you seen
[3357.06 → 3357.54] the insides
[3357.54 → 3358.04] of one of these,
[3358.12 → 3358.20] though?
[3358.26 → 3358.44] It's,
[3358.52 → 3358.62] like,
[3358.84 → 3359.86] super impressive.
[3360.10 → 3360.18] They're,
[3360.26 → 3360.42] like,
[3360.42 → 3361.96] level of
[3361.96 → 3362.66] over-the-top
[3362.66 → 3363.16] engineering
[3363.16 → 3363.46] is,
[3363.56 → 3363.62] like,
[3363.66 → 3363.96] insane.
[3364.06 → 3364.20] It's,
[3364.26 → 3364.30] like,
[3364.32 → 3364.62] they gave
[3364.62 → 3364.92] someone,
[3365.02 → 3365.14] like,
[3365.18 → 3365.66] their first
[3365.66 → 3366.42] engineering job
[3366.42 → 3366.70] and they were,
[3366.78 → 3366.94] like,
[3367.40 → 3368.38] make it the best.
[3368.74 → 3369.54] And instead of them,
[3369.64 → 3369.72] like,
[3369.76 → 3370.56] doing anything
[3370.56 → 3371.54] besides making it
[3371.54 → 3371.94] the best,
[3372.02 → 3372.76] they only made it
[3372.76 → 3373.24] the best.
[3374.84 → 3375.28] It's,
[3375.38 → 3375.52] like,
[3375.52 → 3376.16] like,
[3376.16 → 3376.18] like,
[3376.18 → 3376.20] like,
[3376.20 → 3376.82] the aluminum's,
[3376.82 → 3376.98] like,
[3377.06 → 3377.76] this thick
[3377.76 → 3378.24] in spots.
[3378.24 → 3378.82] It's crazy.
[3380.30 → 3381.18] There's no purpose
[3381.18 → 3382.06] for it to be like that
[3382.06 → 3382.78] and they must be losing
[3382.78 → 3383.58] heaps of money.
[3383.70 → 3383.80] But,
[3383.90 → 3384.10] like,
[3384.52 → 3385.06] if these are all
[3385.06 → 3385.66] just going out,
[3385.70 → 3385.96] if you're,
[3386.06 → 3386.08] like,
[3386.10 → 3386.60] a creator
[3386.60 → 3387.32] or,
[3387.42 → 3387.50] like,
[3387.54 → 3387.64] you,
[3387.72 → 3387.84] like,
[3387.90 → 3388.42] mod things,
[3388.48 → 3389.36] just pick one up,
[3389.40 → 3389.50] like,
[3389.56 → 3390.36] off the side of the road.
[3390.52 → 3390.82] It will,
[3390.94 → 3391.12] like,
[3391.56 → 3392.72] there's amazing stuff
[3392.72 → 3393.32] inside of it.
[3393.84 → 3394.34] Fair enough.
[3394.84 → 3395.40] All right,
[3395.52 → 3396.10] here's something
[3396.10 → 3396.94] uncontroversial,
[3397.04 → 3398.24] equally uncontroversial.
[3398.74 → 3399.96] The Pico Goblin.
[3400.82 → 3401.96] The ultraportable
[3401.96 → 3403.72] first fully untethered
[3403.72 → 3404.42] VR headset.
[3404.62 → 3405.72] Their claim to fame
[3405.72 → 3406.92] for this thing
[3406.92 → 3408.26] is that it doesn't
[3408.26 → 3409.32] require a PC,
[3409.70 → 3410.66] it doesn't require
[3410.66 → 3411.54] any cables,
[3411.76 → 3412.76] it doesn't require
[3412.76 → 3413.40] a phone,
[3413.72 → 3414.04] nothing.
[3414.88 → 3415.60] Mind you,
[3416.00 → 3417.00] I could have designed
[3417.00 → 3418.34] the Pico Goblin
[3418.34 → 3419.80] by taking some
[3419.80 → 3420.82] double-sided tape
[3420.82 → 3422.96] and a Samsung Gear VR
[3422.96 → 3424.12] or a Google Cardboard
[3424.12 → 3425.90] and taping them together
[3425.90 → 3426.94] because to say
[3426.94 → 3427.92] that it doesn't require
[3427.92 → 3428.44] a phone
[3428.44 → 3429.94] and then tell me
[3429.94 → 3431.60] that it's running
[3431.60 → 3432.32] a Qualcomm
[3432.32 → 3433.68] Snapdragon 820 CPU
[3433.68 → 3435.80] with a 5.5-inch
[3435.80 → 3437.44] 2560 by 1440
[3437.44 → 3438.40] resolution display,
[3438.82 → 3439.78] 3G high-speed
[3439.78 → 3440.40] connectivity,
[3441.22 → 3442.34] doesn't say how much,
[3442.42 → 3443.86] but LPDDR4 RAM,
[3443.98 → 3444.68] 16 gigs of
[3444.68 → 3446.48] eMMC 5.1 ROM
[3446.48 → 3448.64] and a 3,500
[3448.64 → 3449.88] William hour battery
[3449.88 → 3452.66] is basically like
[3452.66 → 3453.22] telling me
[3453.22 → 3453.88] that you guys
[3453.88 → 3454.68] engineered a phone
[3454.68 → 3455.32] and then
[3455.32 → 3457.04] glued a headset to it.
[3457.80 → 3458.68] That actually sounds
[3458.68 → 3459.50] a lot like the specs
[3459.50 → 3461.82] for the LG G4.
[3462.18 → 3463.58] Specs for every phone
[3463.58 → 3464.04] ever.
[3465.04 → 3465.80] With that said,
[3465.84 → 3466.30] it's cheap,
[3466.36 → 3467.00] so it's available
[3467.00 → 3467.68] for pre-order
[3467.68 → 3468.86] for $269
[3468.86 → 3469.88] if you wanted
[3469.88 → 3471.44] a fantastic
[3471.44 → 3472.84] VR experience
[3472.84 → 3473.54] because
[3473.54 → 3475.26] unless
[3475.26 → 3476.48] it's tracked
[3476.48 → 3477.48] outside in
[3477.48 → 3478.36] right now,
[3478.36 → 3479.62] we are
[3479.62 → 3480.84] not there yet.
[3481.36 → 3481.80] But,
[3481.94 → 3482.38] where we are
[3482.38 → 3482.90] is at the end
[3482.90 → 3483.36] of the show,
[3483.60 → 3484.16] so Alex,
[3484.24 → 3485.16] unless you looked like
[3485.16 → 3485.84] you were going to say something.
[3485.84 → 3487.48] No.
[3487.92 → 3488.34] Okay.
[3490.12 → 3490.44] Alright.
[3490.44 → 3491.30] I'm rolling the outro.
[3491.96 → 3492.64] Goodbye, people.
[3492.88 → 3493.70] They can't hear you.
[3493.78 → 3494.20] There's music.
[3494.94 → 3495.92] Pretty sure they can still
[3495.92 → 3496.32] hear us.
[3496.38 → 3496.98] A little bit.
[3497.22 → 3497.80] Yeah, it's just
[3497.80 → 3498.58] uncomfortable.
[3498.58 → 3499.32] Some people complain.
[3500.38 → 3500.90] I don't know.
[3500.96 → 3501.50] I kind of like it.
[3501.50 → 3503.34] G4 was 808,
[3503.50 → 3503.78] dude.
[3503.90 → 3504.88] Not even close.
[3506.12 → 3506.60] So,
[3506.80 → 3507.16] yeah.
[3507.34 → 3507.94] Why don't you just
[3507.94 → 3508.64] get crapped on
[3508.64 → 3509.06] right there?
[3510.14 → 3511.00] Does anyone actually
[3511.00 → 3511.46] care about the
[3511.46 → 3512.32] Snapdragon processors,
[3512.32 → 3512.60] though?
[3513.14 → 3513.58] Um,
[3513.98 → 3514.34] yeah.
[3514.58 → 3514.76] Like,
[3514.80 → 3515.48] they matter a bit,
[3515.58 → 3515.98] but they're all
[3515.98 → 3516.74] kind of the same thing.
[3517.18 → 3517.56] Well,
[3517.88 → 3518.14] like,
[3518.24 → 3519.22] they get faster.
[3520.68 → 3521.40] I guess so,
[3521.44 → 3521.60] yeah.
[3521.86 → 3522.12] Yeah.
