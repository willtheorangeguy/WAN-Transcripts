[0.00 → 2.00] Welcome to the WAN Show!
[2.00 → 10.00] We have a great show for you guys today, which is good because we're- you guys have been waiting so very long for it to start.
[10.00 → 11.00] Not the YouTube audience.
[11.00 → 18.00] Um, we've got a special guest with us here. He can't get his webcam working, but quite frankly that was the least of the issues we had today.
[18.00 → 21.00] So, Kyle from Nitwit. Say hi, Kyle.
[24.00 → 25.00] Yeah.
[30.00 → 34.00] Our powers combined!
[34.00 → 35.00] Yeah.
[36.00 → 37.00] It's- Yeah.
[38.00 → 39.00] Late squared.
[39.00 → 42.00] Oh my god, we should do co-op shows called Late Squared.
[42.00 → 44.00] Apparently they can't hear you.
[44.00 → 45.00] What?
[48.00 → 50.00] Wait, you're not coming through on the Discord anymore.
[50.00 → 52.00] Your mic is muted on Discord.
[52.00 → 54.00] Unmute yourself on Discord.
[54.00 → 56.00] Unmute yourself on Discord, Kyle!
[56.00 → 57.00] Done!
[57.00 → 58.00] Done!
[58.00 → 59.00] Oh!
[59.00 → 60.00] Oh man!
[60.00 → 61.00] Okay, okay.
[61.00 → 62.00] Whew!
[62.00 → 63.00] I'm breathing.
[63.00 → 64.00] I'm breathing now.
[64.00 → 65.00] Okay.
[65.00 → 66.00] Whew!
[66.00 → 69.00] So yes, Kyle.
[69.00 → 70.00] Kyle is here.
[70.00 → 71.00] Yes, Kyle.
[71.00 → 72.00] I'm here.
[72.00 → 73.00] Trust me, he's here.
[73.00 → 75.00] We have topics.
[75.00 → 86.00] Topic number one is that Kyle is the first person, the first creator for the float plane platform-
[86.00 → 87.00] Oh my goodness!
[87.00 → 88.00] Of all time.
[88.00 → 89.00] What do I do?
[89.00 → 90.00] Oh!
[90.00 → 91.00] Wow.
[91.00 → 92.00] Except for Linus Tech Tips.
[92.00 → 93.00] Yeah, that doesn't really count though.
[93.00 → 94.00] Oh!
[94.00 → 95.00] Yeah, yeah.
[95.00 → 96.00] So he's-
[96.00 → 98.00] He's number two.
[98.00 → 99.00] Yeah.
[99.00 → 100.00] Yeah.
[100.00 → 106.00] Um, in other news, NVIDIA teases another Titan X, the collector's edition.
[106.00 → 107.00] We–we needed this.
[107.00 → 115.00] In other news, next gen AMD Epic could be equipped with an Epic 64 cores.
[115.00 → 116.00] We also needed that.
[116.00 → 119.00] And in other news, Racer announced a phone.
[119.00 → 120.00] For gamers.
[120.00 → 121.00] We needed that too.
[121.00 → 124.00] I am going to roll the intro.
[124.00 → 125.00] What we really needed is-
[125.00 → 126.00] Nope.
[126.00 → 127.00] Wow Classic servers-
[127.00 → 128.00] No, I'm rolling the-
[128.00 → 129.00] Officially on Blizzard.
[129.00 → 130.00] I'm rolling the intro.
[130.00 → 131.00] Yes!
[131.00 → 132.00] I knew he was going to try and get it.
[132.00 → 133.00] I'm so excited!
[133.00 → 134.00] Okay, I'm rolling the intro.
[134.00 → 135.00] Oh!
[137.00 → 138.00] Okay.
[138.00 → 139.00] I think we broke.
[139.00 → 140.00] Um.
[140.00 → 143.00] It's weird, because I can't say battle.net anymore, cause that's not what it is.
[143.00 → 145.00] It's Blizzard app.
[145.00 → 146.00] What?
[146.00 → 147.00] Blizzard app?
[147.00 → 148.00] That just is-
[148.00 → 149.00] It's so stupid.
[149.00 → 150.00] No, that's terrible.
[150.00 → 151.00] The launcher thing though.
[151.00 → 156.00] I'm not- I'm not playing any Blizzard games right now, but are people actually following suit and calling it that?
[156.00 → 158.00] Or are people just like, no, fuck it, I'm still calling it battle.net?
[158.00 → 159.00] I- I think-
[159.00 → 161.00] They're probably like, no, screw it.
[161.00 → 162.00] What you profanity?
[162.00 → 163.00] I'm just going to call it battle.net.
[163.00 → 170.00] I think- I think mostly, uh, people are saying battle.net, but, um, I don't really know.
[170.00 → 173.00] No intro music, by the way.
[173.00 → 174.00] Oh, I don't even care.
[174.00 → 178.00] Yeah, that's- that's a luxury at this point.
[178.00 → 179.00] Getting the DJ to work.
[179.00 → 181.00] Yeah, I don't know how that would even-
[181.00 → 182.00] Did you launch the YouTube video?
[182.00 → 185.00] ... happen, because I like legit did not change that at all.
[185.00 → 186.00] You published the YouTube video?
[186.00 → 187.00] No, I haven't.
[187.00 → 188.00] Oh, yeah, yeah, I published the YouTube video.
[188.00 → 189.00] We're good, we're good, we're good, we're live.
[189.00 → 190.00] Alright.
[190.00 → 191.00] Okay, so-
[191.00 → 192.00] Oh my god.
[192.00 → 193.00] Apparently it's now blizzardbattle.net.
[193.00 → 194.00] They changed it again.
[194.00 → 195.00] Wow.
[195.00 → 196.00] That's terrible, and they should feel terrible.
[196.00 → 208.00] Wow, Blizzard, the only entity to change their name more often than I do.
[208.00 → 210.00] That's saying a lot.
[210.00 → 212.00] I'm no longer the worst.
[212.00 → 213.00] Thank God.
[213.00 → 216.00] Oh, I wouldn't say you're no longer the worst, man.
[216.00 → 217.00] Congratulations.
[217.00 → 218.00] Oh.
[218.00 → 219.00] Okay, we're tied for worst.
[219.00 → 220.00] That's still-
[220.00 → 221.00] Okay.
[221.00 → 222.00] That's still okay.
[222.00 → 224.00] Okay, so I know you said you have to go at five.
[224.00 → 226.00] Um, the time is now five.
[226.00 → 227.00] Yeah, yeah.
[227.00 → 228.00] 546?
[228.00 → 232.00] I actually got to take my intermission bio break before the stream started.
[232.00 → 233.00] It's great.
[233.00 → 236.00] No, no, it's totally fine.
[236.00 → 239.00] I mean, I don't have like anywhere to be at a specific time.
[239.00 → 240.00] Okay.
[240.00 → 243.00] I was just trying to limit it to like a half hour so I could get all my shit done.
[243.00 → 244.00] Yeah.
[244.00 → 245.00] Got it.
[245.00 → 246.00] Well, so much for that.
[246.00 → 247.00] Dino.
[247.00 → 249.00] So, do you want to talk about some other stuff?
[249.00 → 254.00] Because I'm sure you'd love to talk classic WoW, Nvidia Titan, Collectors Edition.
[254.00 → 256.00] Actually, there's a lot of really great stuff today.
[256.00 → 259.00] So do you want to talk some topics with us first, or do you want to jump into float plane?
[259.00 → 260.00] What do you want to do?
[260.00 → 261.00] It's up to you.
[261.00 → 263.00] We've wasted enough of your time.
[263.00 → 264.00] Yeah.
[264.00 → 266.00] It's totally your guys' call.
[266.00 → 269.00] Um, I mean, I guess we can start with the float plane stuff.
[269.00 → 270.00] Okay.
[270.00 → 271.00] That's news.
[271.00 → 272.00] Okay, cool.
[272.00 → 273.00] Let's do it.
[273.00 → 274.00] Yeah.
[274.00 → 284.00] So, Kyle is the first person to join float plane and he is having the pre-alpha experience.
[284.00 → 286.00] That is for sure.
[286.00 → 288.00] How's it going so far there?
[288.00 → 291.00] It's, it's, it totally is pre-alpha, man.
[291.00 → 296.00] Like, I feel like, I feel like jumping in like as the first, it's almost like I'm the
[296.00 → 298.00] first woman that any man has ever seen.
[299.00 → 300.00] Like, on the floor.
[300.00 → 301.00] They're like, oh my God.
[301.00 → 302.00] There's, what is that?
[302.00 → 303.00] We've never seen one of these before.
[303.00 → 306.00] I'm just getting like royal treatment.
[306.00 → 307.00] It's, it's so, it's super cool.
[307.00 → 309.00] And everyone's incredibly nice.
[309.00 → 313.00] Um, you know, like when I first went in there, and I was like interacting with people and like
[313.00 → 314.00] saying, oh, thanks.
[314.00 → 316.00] I was like replying to everyone individually.
[316.00 → 320.00] And some guy was like, you know, kindly was like, Hey, you know, like glad you're here.
[320.00 → 321.00] But by the way, you can use like the multi-quote.
[321.00 → 322.00] Multi-quote.
[322.00 → 323.00] Yeah.
[323.00 → 324.00] It's probably preferred.
[324.00 → 325.00] And so I was like, yeah, sure.
[325.00 → 326.00] And then like, I actually tried it out.
[326.00 → 327.00] I was like, yeah.
[327.00 → 329.00] Like, what do you think of my first multi-quote?
[329.00 → 330.00] How did I do?
[330.00 → 332.00] And he's like, well, you only quoted me.
[332.00 → 333.00] So it's hard to say.
[333.00 → 338.00] I feel like my grandpa on Facebook right now.
[338.00 → 340.00] Um, so I mean, but it's, but it's been great.
[340.00 → 342.00] Like your community is awesome.
[342.00 → 344.00] Everyone's been super kind and welcoming so far.
[344.00 → 345.00] So, okay.
[345.00 → 347.00] Well, that's, that's really cool.
[347.00 → 348.00] That's great.
[348.00 → 350.00] Um, okay.
[350.00 → 355.00] So basically right now, the way that it works, I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna fire up the
[355.00 → 356.00] store here.
[356.00 → 361.00] Um, is if you go to this, so, okay.
[361.00 → 366.00] Our plan was actually not to bring on other creators.
[366.00 → 367.00] No.
[367.00 → 368.00] What?
[368.00 → 369.00] So it was just me?
[369.00 → 371.00] You created float plane just for Nitwit?
[371.00 → 372.00] No.
[372.00 → 375.00] No, definitely not.
[375.00 → 376.00] I'm getting touched.
[376.00 → 382.00] Um, Luke just hasn't slept a lot in the last, um, week and a half.
[382.00 → 383.00] Week.
[383.00 → 385.00] In the last year.
[385.00 → 387.00] To be fair, no one on the float plane team really has.
[387.00 → 388.00] So, thanks.
[388.00 → 396.00] Because the plan for float plane was to bring other creators on sometime after Linus Media
[396.00 → 401.00] Group Properties had been live on the new site for some time.
[401.00 → 402.00] Yeah.
[402.00 → 403.00] Oh yeah.
[403.00 → 404.00] So like, like a while from now.
[404.00 → 405.00] Yeah.
[405.00 → 408.00] So like, potentially other creators were still four to six months out.
[408.00 → 409.00] Yeah.
[409.00 → 411.00] In terms of a realistic timeline.
[411.00 → 413.00] And it was like, okay, let's do it.
[413.00 → 419.00] I definitely, I was kind of the, uh, you know, if I was, if I was float planes child,
[419.00 → 422.00] I was, I was definitely the mistake child.
[422.00 → 423.00] Yeah.
[423.00 → 425.00] You were the premature, the first one being the first one being the first one being the
[425.00 → 426.00] premature child.
[426.00 → 427.00] Yeah.
[427.00 → 428.00] Um, so basically.
[428.00 → 430.00] And I think you can partially blame YouTube for that.
[430.00 → 431.00] Right?
[431.00 → 432.00] Well, yeah.
[432.00 → 433.00] I think I've been doing a paid channel as of two days ago.
[433.00 → 438.00] And as far as I know, I'm like one of the few, if not the only tech, uh, YouTuber that
[438.00 → 441.00] actually had a paid channel on YouTube's platform.
[441.00 → 442.00] So.
[442.00 → 443.00] Yeah.
[443.00 → 445.00] I was really the only one to seemingly get affected by it.
[445.00 → 449.00] And then that's when you guys were like, Hey, like speaking of which we've got an alternative.
[449.00 → 450.00] That's way better.
[450.00 → 452.00] Uh, well, let's not get ahead of ourselves.
[452.00 → 458.00] We haven't seen the actual official site yet, but we, but we're working on an alternative.
[458.00 → 463.00] So, so how long were you running bit with ultra as a paid channel through YouTube before
[463.00 → 466.00] they just like canned it?
[466.00 → 471.00] Um, I want to say it's been about a year, which lines up.
[471.00 → 472.00] I feel like YouTube.
[472.00 → 473.00] Yeah.
[473.00 → 474.00] I feel like YouTube.
[474.00 → 475.00] Yeah.
[475.00 → 476.00] It definitely lines up with like how YouTube works.
[476.00 → 478.00] Because they like to like work you up and be like, Hey, look at all these new features and
[478.00 → 479.00] things we added.
[479.00 → 480.00] And then like, it's congratulations.
[480.00 → 481.00] It's your one-year anniversary.
[481.00 → 483.00] We're shutting it down.
[483.00 → 487.00] Um, so I guess like it just kind of happened out of nowhere, but yeah, it's been, it's been
[487.00 → 488.00] going for about a year now.
[488.00 → 495.00] I launched a bit with ultra, which was basically early access at free content, um, both on YouTube
[495.00 → 499.00] and Patriot simultaneously, because there was a huge, a huge group of people who weren't
[499.00 → 503.00] able to view paid channels on YouTube based on the country.
[503.00 → 504.00] Apparently not all countries are supported there.
[504.00 → 507.00] So it was a huge, huge, just sort of ordeal.
[507.00 → 512.00] I was thinking, Oh, you know, it's not bad uploading all my content to a second channel.
[512.00 → 513.00] That's, that's not too much work.
[513.00 → 516.00] And then I find out that I have to upload it to a third channel now.
[516.00 → 519.00] Cause Patreon doesn't actually have a native uploader.
[519.00 → 524.00] So I actually had to upload, I had to create a third YouTube channel, upload all my early
[524.00 → 528.00] access content there, have it unlisted and then link it to Patreon.
[528.00 → 529.00] It was just like, so, okay.
[529.00 → 537.00] For the viewers out there that are sitting there going, well, gee, um, why, why are you
[537.00 → 538.00] an idiot?
[538.00 → 543.00] Why didn't you just upload the video to your nitwit channel unlisted a week early and then
[543.00 → 547.00] give that to the Patreon people and then just set it public and hold on.
[547.00 → 549.00] No, no, there's a legitimate reason for this.
[549.00 → 552.00] Whether Kyle himself is actually aware of it or not.
[552.00 → 556.00] I'm not sure, but there's a real reason for this.
[556.00 → 563.00] And we've observed that algorithmically YouTube doesn't entirely forget.
[563.00 → 568.00] And I'm using finger quotes for forget because YouTube is a not a sentient being.
[568.00 → 574.00] Um, although yeah, so we, so far, um, it is machine that is learning.
[574.00 → 577.00] YouTube, YouTube, that was the worst.
[577.00 → 581.00] YouTube doesn't, sorry, Nick was doing the stairs behind us.
[581.00 → 585.00] He was walking down the stairs behind the show, and he's like, he's like still in like
[585.00 → 589.00] 20% of the frame by the time he's like standing up and walking away.
[589.00 → 595.00] Um, so YouTube doesn't entirely forget the upload date.
[595.00 → 596.00] Yeah.
[596.00 → 602.00] When it does its machine learning nonsense about, you know, sending out your video to people.
[602.00 → 608.00] So what's weird is like you'll upload something a week early, let's say, and you'll set it public.
[608.00 → 614.00] And the public, like the date you see for the video upload externally is the date you made it public.
[614.00 → 619.00] But the date you see internally in your CMS is the date you uploaded it.
[619.00 → 620.00] YouTube still knows.
[620.00 → 628.00] And what we've observed is that leaving something sitting on the channel for some time actually causes it to kind of rot.
[628.00 → 629.00] Yeah.
[629.00 → 634.00] And not only just that, but if you upload something unlisted with the same name, thumbnail and actual video content,
[634.00 → 638.00] and then release another one, that second one will also get tanked.
[638.00 → 645.00] So, and that's exactly why a lot of people were wondering, like a lot of my ultra subscribers who were, you know,
[645.00 → 650.00] when it was still on YouTube, they were like, pal, why are you uploading the same video, but with a different title and thumbnail?
[650.00 → 651.00] Yeah.
[651.00 → 665.00] Because I was noticing as I was getting, you know, getting situated with, with this new model and stuff, is that like my video, my view cam just started to tank with all these videos that were getting re-uploaded, you know, essentially on a different channel, but still using the same metadata and things like that.
[665.00 → 666.00] Yeah.
[666.00 → 672.00] And then I noticed that there was sort of an uptick once I started switching up the thumbnails, and then I was like, oh my God, this becomes even more work now.
[672.00 → 679.00] But it was just that, it is what it is, you know, it was just kind of, that's how they do it.
[679.00 → 693.00] And like, to be clear to the viewers out there, you know, YouTubers as a whole are not like complaining about the hard work that we do to, you know, come up with a different title for the video the second time we upload it or whatever.
[693.00 → 709.00] It's just one of those things where the, honestly, where it really runs into a lot of work for us is when there's all these little different moving parts that we have to get synchronized and then something's wrong, and you have to like bail on a family dinner and go figure out what's going on and which one you forgot.
[709.00 → 714.00] And it's just having a bunch of different moving parts when you go to publish a video is just kind of a pain in the butt.
[714.00 → 721.00] And it can also be more difficult than people realize to actually come up with two good thumbnails and two good titles for the same video.
[721.00 → 731.00] It's hard enough to find one really effective thumbnail and title, let alone two, where like it's actually perfect and eye catching and Gabby, but also doesn't piss off your audience for being clickbait.
[731.00 → 736.00] It's, it's a you have to, you have to find that fine line and finding two things on the fine line can be...
[736.00 → 738.00] Boy is that ever a balancing act.
[738.00 → 739.00] Yeah.
[739.00 → 740.00] Yeah.
[740.00 → 743.00] Think that it was video because I had a video.
[743.00 → 744.00] Oh, yeah, yeah.
[744.00 → 746.00] So they're like, you're trying to do this to get more views.
[746.00 → 749.00] Like, no, I'm not trying to duplicate my views.
[749.00 → 751.00] I'm not trying to get your views twice.
[751.00 → 758.00] I'm trying to attract, you know, single unique view of a viewership.
[758.00 → 761.00] So it just gets, it gets all messed up.
[761.00 → 768.00] I mean, the such a gap of communication, you know, what's going on behind the scenes between the creator and viewers.
[768.00 → 773.00] But they understand just exactly what we're going for.
[773.00 → 784.00] Um, one of my favourite things is that this whole paid channels going down thing is on the exact to the day, one-year anniversary of Vessel going down.
[784.00 → 786.00] Is it really?
[786.00 → 787.00] Did you know?
[787.00 → 788.00] Yeah.
[788.00 → 789.00] November 1st.
[789.00 → 790.00] I did not notice.
[790.00 → 791.00] I tweeted about it and everything.
[791.00 → 795.00] November 1st was when, was when Vessel went down and November 1st was when YouTube paid channels went down.
[795.00 → 796.00] Interesting.
[796.00 → 802.00] So on the anniversary of Vessel going down, paid channels went down and Kyle joined Flip plane.
[802.00 → 803.00] Huh.
[803.00 → 809.00] And it's also, I mean, because float plane started almost to the day when Vessel went down.
[809.00 → 810.00] Yeah.
[810.00 → 813.00] Cause those two, those two events were somewhat related, let's say.
[813.00 → 814.00] Yeah.
[814.00 → 819.00] Um, that's also the anniversary of a float plane development actually starting.
[819.00 → 821.00] Not quite to the day, but like a few days earlier.
[821.00 → 822.00] That's a little bit of a strong.
[822.00 → 823.00] It's gray.
[823.00 → 824.00] It's gray.
[824.00 → 826.00] Well, cause there's also different stages.
[826.00 → 829.00] Cause like the very beginning we were like, we put videos on forum, you download.
[829.00 → 830.00] Hooray.
[830.00 → 832.00] Um, now there's like streaming.
[832.00 → 834.00] Can I tease things a little bit later?
[834.00 → 836.00] Can we talk about it a little bit?
[836.00 → 837.00] It's so Jacky right now.
[837.00 → 841.00] I know, but can we just, can we just show some of the let's, let's just do it.
[841.00 → 842.00] Okay.
[842.00 → 845.00] So first, first I'm going to show the way that it actually works.
[845.00 → 848.00] So Kyle and I talked about this last night.
[848.00 → 851.00] One of the things that float plane strives to do us.
[851.00 → 855.00] Jax and the other guy that I don't know if his name is able to be public are going to slap me.
[855.00 → 856.00] But yeah, let's do it.
[856.00 → 857.00] We'll figure this out.
[857.00 → 858.00] We'll figure this out.
[858.00 → 860.00] So, um, uh, so, so Kyle and I were talking last night.
[860.00 → 865.00] One of the things that float plane really wants to do is work with the creators on what's going to work best for the platform.
[865.00 → 873.00] And since Kyle joined, um, one of the biggest pieces of feedback we've gotten from viewers has been like,
[873.00 → 878.00] yo, right now it's $3 for Linus Media Group, and it's $3 for Nitwit.
[878.00 → 882.00] It would be great if we could combine those and do like a combo purchase.
[882.00 → 884.00] And so I had a call with Kyle.
[884.00 → 886.00] Uh, we talked it through last night.
[886.00 → 887.00] I talked to Luke today.
[887.00 → 896.00] And basically the conclusion that we came to is that if we were to offer a discount, we are either going to be,
[896.00 → 905.00] like what it's going to turn into is it's going to turn into trying to build a video platform as opposed to trying to build a tool for individual creators to use.
[905.00 → 910.00] And that wasn't really the point of the platform in the first place.
[910.00 → 929.00] So we crunched some numbers, and we figured out, okay, well, what if the float plane platform itself could just make some pie in the sky assumptions about bandwidth usage being significantly lower for one person subscribed to 10 creators versus 10 people subscribed to one creator.
[929.00 → 933.00] And we could just kind of absorb that out of there.
[933.00 → 938.00] And what we ended up with was a discount level that would frankly look kind of insulting.
[938.00 → 940.00] Yeah.
[940.00 → 944.00] And what we also ended up with was a fundamental change to the model that we didn't really like.
[944.00 → 951.00] So for us, we want to make sure that we're operating with a safe amount of margin to keep the platform sustainable.
[951.00 → 955.00] Because we don't want to go down on November 1st, 2018.
[955.00 → 956.00] Yeah, really.
[956.00 → 963.00] And the other thing is that if we have extra, we have no problem giving it back.
[963.00 → 966.00] But for us, it's a creator first platform.
[966.00 → 971.00] And we'd love to do things like, and Kyle, this is probably the first time you're hearing about this.
[971.00 → 984.00] But one of the things that I'd like to do is take all the float plane margin that's coming in from your first couple of months here and then dump that into some promoted posts on Facebook and stuff like that to see if we can drive in more subscribers.
[984.00 → 993.00] So that's the kind of thing that we'd rather do versus just discount a bundle of three creators by like a dollar.
[993.00 → 994.00] Right.
[994.00 → 999.00] So we want to make sure that any money that's coming in is going to support the creators on the platform.
[999.00 → 1002.00] So I think we've pretty much made a final decision there.
[1002.00 → 1011.00] We're not going to offer bundles because it would really either hamper the choice of creators in terms of the types of bundles that they want to offer consumers.
[1011.00 → 1016.00] Or it would hamper our ability to properly develop and support the creators and the platform.
[1016.00 → 1018.00] So there you go. There's that.
[1018.00 → 1023.00] Now let's jump into some stuff that nobody has really seen before.
[1023.00 → 1024.00] Oh, Geez.
[1024.00 → 1026.00] Okay. Okay. Actually, one more thing.
[1026.00 → 1038.00] This won't be the only time that I pimp this, but it is in our best interest now for the first time ever to drive subscriptions to another creator, which is weird.
[1038.00 → 1039.00] What?
[1039.00 → 1041.00] This is like a weird, awkward position for me.
[1041.00 → 1043.00] So I'm posting some links right now.
[1043.00 → 1045.00] It's only awkward if you want it to be.
[1045.00 → 1050.00] Right now you actually access Nitwit through the LTT forum.
[1050.00 → 1053.00] So I'm going to show you guys how that looks.
[1053.00 → 1054.00] Oh, I hopefully.
[1054.00 → 1056.00] Which I still have not gotten used to.
[1056.00 → 1057.00] Don't put in your admin account.
[1057.00 → 1063.00] Any time I log in, like, log in to Linus Tech Tips and go to the store, I see Float plane, and I just see my logo.
[1063.00 → 1066.00] I'm like, okay, they're getting DDoS right now.
[1066.00 → 1068.00] What's happening?
[1068.00 → 1070.00] This doesn't make any sense.
[1070.00 → 1071.00] No, yeah.
[1071.00 → 1073.00] No, it's not an error.
[1073.00 → 1076.00] That is a Nitwit logo on LinusTechTips.com.
[1076.00 → 1077.00] Super bizarre.
[1077.00 → 1088.00] So once you're subscribed, what happens is you'll see this Float plane section at the top of the forum, and then you'll be able to go to Nitwit Ultra, and you will find...
[1088.00 → 1095.00] Okay, so right now, which ones are early access right now?
[1095.00 → 1096.00] Videos?
[1096.00 → 1097.00] Yeah.
[1097.00 → 1099.00] So, let's see.
[1099.00 → 1102.00] I think there's the announcement...
[1102.00 → 1107.00] Well, actually, right now there are no early access videos as far as, like, a week early.
[1107.00 → 1110.00] There's just one that posted today...
[1110.00 → 1111.00] Can you tell me what's coming?
[1111.00 → 1115.00] Uh, yes, I can, actually.
[1115.00 → 1118.00] Uh, the H700i from NZXT, the new case.
[1118.00 → 1119.00] Oh, cool.
[1119.00 → 1120.00] Okay.
[1120.00 → 1121.00] That's, like, $200.
[1121.00 → 1123.00] That's going to be going up very soon.
[1123.00 → 1127.00] Um, and additionally, I think there's...
[1127.00 → 1128.00] What's the other one?
[1128.00 → 1130.00] There's other stuff.
[1130.00 → 1132.00] There's more good stuff coming soon.
[1132.00 → 1134.00] I can't even think of it right now.
[1134.00 → 1136.00] That's fine.
[1136.00 → 1137.00] That's a good enough sales pitch.
[1137.00 → 1138.00] Don't worry about it.
[1138.00 → 1140.00] Yeah, yeah, it's totally great.
[1140.00 → 1142.00] Plus, it'll look way better than it does on you.
[1142.00 → 1143.00] Yeah.
[1143.00 → 1144.00] Yeah, dog.
[1144.00 → 1145.00] Yeah.
[1145.00 → 1147.00] And the secret to that is what?
[1147.00 → 1148.00] Just, like, higher bit rate?
[1148.00 → 1149.00] Basically.
[1149.00 → 1154.00] Because a lot of people in the forum were saying that the 720 on your forum, or on float plane,
[1154.00 → 1158.00] really, is looking better and crispier than 1080p on YouTube.
[1158.00 → 1159.00] Yeah, so it's...
[1159.00 → 1161.00] Is that basically a bit rate thing?
[1161.00 → 1162.00] It's more nuanced than that.
[1162.00 → 1169.00] There's, like, how you transcode it to be able to get more quality and a lower amount of bit rate and all this kind of jazz.
[1169.00 → 1173.00] But, yeah, there's some special sauce going on.
[1173.00 → 1174.00] It does look perfect.
[1174.00 → 1175.00] Yeah.
[1175.00 → 1177.00] I'm like, wow, I don't even have to use my nice camera anymore.
[1177.00 → 1178.00] I can use my phone.
[1178.00 → 1181.00] And it looks like all my good stuff.
[1181.00 → 1188.00] It's actually kind of like what I've seen a pretty common comparison for, and this is not from me, is that it's one step up, kind of.
[1188.00 → 1191.00] So 720 on ours looks sort of like 1080 on YouTube.
[1191.00 → 1193.00] 1080 on ours looks sort of like 4K on YouTube.
[1193.00 → 1194.00] Yeah.
[1194.00 → 1196.00] And we haven't launched 4K yet.
[1196.00 → 1198.00] We haven't...
[1198.00 → 1199.00] Okay.
[1199.00 → 1201.00] We are getting way ahead of ourselves here.
[1201.00 → 1208.00] Okay, the last time I'm going to get ahead of ourselves today is to show you guys what the site will not look like.
[1208.00 → 1209.00] Oh.
[1209.00 → 1210.00] Effectively.
[1210.00 → 1211.00] YouTube.com.
[1211.00 → 1213.00] Because it's going to be pretty different from this, right?
[1213.00 → 1214.00] Sort of.
[1214.00 → 1215.00] Oh, okay, so it's not that different anymore?
[1215.00 → 1216.00] It's not going to be that different.
[1216.00 → 1217.00] Oh, okay, okay, cool.
[1217.00 → 1219.00] And never mind, I thought I was looking at an old version.
[1219.00 → 1221.00] No, because the blue top bar is gone.
[1221.00 → 1222.00] Ah, okay.
[1222.00 → 1228.00] Because if you click on an individual channel, like if you click on Tech Quickie, you can see how the top bar being gone affects it more.
[1228.00 → 1229.00] There you go.
[1229.00 → 1230.00] Ah, yes.
[1230.00 → 1231.00] Okay, cool.
[1231.00 → 1234.00] Okay, so Kyle, you may actually be seeing...
[1234.00 → 1236.00] No, you've seen this because you can log into it.
[1236.00 → 1237.00] So right now, registration is closed.
[1237.00 → 1238.00] Yeah.
[1238.00 → 1239.00] You can't log into the site.
[1239.00 → 1240.00] Yeah, stop it.
[1240.00 → 1246.00] But we are showing for the first time what float plane may or may not end up looking like.
[1246.00 → 1248.00] Yeah, there's definitely going to be changes.
[1248.00 → 1249.00] Yeah.
[1249.00 → 1251.00] We're obviously not going to have a giant Racer logo in our banner.
[1251.00 → 1252.00] Yeah, no.
[1252.00 → 1253.00] That's just a placeholder.
[1253.00 → 1254.00] A random placeholder image.
[1254.00 → 1255.00] Yep.
[1255.00 → 1257.00] But there will be channel banners like this.
[1257.00 → 1261.00] Videos are going to be basically the star of the show.
[1261.00 → 1263.00] As far as the page layout goes.
[1263.00 → 1265.00] There is going to be layout differences though.
[1265.00 → 1266.00] There will be layout differences.
[1266.00 → 1267.00] And this is the videos tab.
[1267.00 → 1270.00] So this actually might look pretty exactly how it does now.
[1270.00 → 1273.00] But there's probably going to be a home tab that looks different.
[1273.00 → 1276.00] Right now, it's full of placeholder garbage.
[1276.00 → 1278.00] Like, we make videos and stuff.
[1278.00 → 1280.00] Cool A. You should probably check out Linus Cat Tips.
[1280.00 → 1281.00] Who put that there?
[1281.00 → 1284.00] I think that was Linus Forestall.
[1284.00 → 1286.00] Okay, brilliant.
[1286.00 → 1289.00] So here's what playlists may or may not end up looking like.
[1289.00 → 1290.00] Everything is very much a work in progress.
[1290.00 → 1292.00] Yeah, there's a different idea for those.
[1292.00 → 1293.00] Yeah.
[1293.00 → 1294.00] Oh.
[1294.00 → 1295.00] Um.
[1295.00 → 1298.00] How close to the comment section is this going to be?
[1298.00 → 1299.00] Type one in.
[1299.00 → 1300.00] Hey, here's a comment.
[1300.00 → 1301.00] Post.
[1301.00 → 1302.00] Woo!
[1302.00 → 1305.00] So there you go guys, there's a comment.
[1305.00 → 1306.00] There's-
[1306.00 → 1308.00] Wow, in real time it says how many seconds ago it was.
[1308.00 → 1309.00] Like and dislike.
[1309.00 → 1310.00] Okay, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1310.00 → 1312.00] That's probably not going to continue to be a thing.
[1312.00 → 1313.00] Hold on.
[1313.00 → 1314.00] No.
[1314.00 → 1317.00] Real time comment counters.
[1317.00 → 1318.00] No.
[1318.00 → 1319.00] Real time.
[1319.00 → 1320.00] Probably not.
[1320.00 → 1323.00] Yeah, so bad.
[1323.00 → 1324.00] Wow.
[1324.00 → 1325.00] Wow.
[1325.00 → 1330.00] Um, so here's some, you know, other videos from this particular creator.
[1330.00 → 1333.00] So these aren't hooked into the back end so we can't play the video right now, but that's-
[1333.00 → 1334.00] Yeah.
[1334.00 → 1335.00] That's not a huge deal.
[1335.00 → 1338.00] Um, are we planning to have the video stay playable at the top as we scroll through the
[1338.00 → 1339.00] comments?
[1339.00 → 1343.00] Yeah, so it's going to stay fixed, and you'll keep scrolling, and this pretty screen will scroll.
[1343.00 → 1344.00] Yeah.
[1344.00 → 1349.00] One of the major things that we need to work on right now is, uh, being able to do payment
[1349.00 → 1350.00] stuff.
[1350.00 → 1351.00] Yeah.
[1351.00 → 1352.00] Um, account creation is doing pretty okay.
[1352.00 → 1357.00] We're working on connected accounts so that you guys can log in with your forum accounts
[1357.00 → 1361.00] that you already have for Bitwise Ultra and LMG float plane.
[1361.00 → 1364.00] And we'll have access to the things that you've already paid for on the new site so you don't
[1364.00 → 1366.00] need to do anything.
[1366.00 → 1371.00] And then we'll just, uh, incentivize changing over payment platforms because honestly the
[1371.00 → 1372.00] one we're on right now is-
[1372.00 → 1373.00] Terrible.
[1373.00 → 1374.00] Super terrible.
[1374.00 → 1377.00] And you should be on the new one, but we're going to like to try to have some incentives so
[1377.00 → 1379.00] that you want to be on the new one too.
[1379.00 → 1383.00] Um, and there's, yeah, there's, there's, there's definitely more stuff to do on the site,
[1383.00 → 1386.00] but, um, that's sort of how it will look.
[1386.00 → 1387.00] Yeah.
[1387.00 → 1390.00] No like crazy major changes outside of that.
[1390.00 → 1395.00] Um, oh, oh, you're not streaming this.
[1395.00 → 1396.00] Okay.
[1396.00 → 1397.00] No, no, I'm not streaming this.
[1397.00 → 1398.00] I was like, all right, we're showing that.
[1398.00 → 1399.00] Okay.
[1399.00 → 1400.00] Well, I was kind of thinking, why not?
[1400.00 → 1401.00] I mean, we can, yeah.
[1401.00 → 1403.00] We can show, we can show how alpha it is.
[1403.00 → 1406.00] Hey Kyle, do you think we should show them the alpha-ness of the CMS?
[1406.00 → 1408.00] The alpha-ness?
[1408.00 → 1410.00] Sorry, my vocabulary is not-
[1410.00 → 1411.00] Alpha, beta.
[1411.00 → 1412.00] Alpha, beta.
[1412.00 → 1413.00] Okay.
[1413.00 → 1414.00] We're going to do it.
[1414.00 → 1415.00] Yes.
[1415.00 → 1416.00] Yes.
[1416.00 → 1417.00] The answer is yes.
[1417.00 → 1418.00] A thousand times yes.
[1418.00 → 1419.00] We're going to do it.
[1419.00 → 1420.00] Okay.
[1420.00 → 1421.00] Oh, should I show the settings page too?
[1421.00 → 1422.00] Do it.
[1422.00 → 1423.00] Uh, sure.
[1423.00 → 1424.00] Yeah.
[1424.00 → 1425.00] Okay.
[1425.00 → 1426.00] None of the other tabs work.
[1426.00 → 1427.00] Yeah.
[1427.00 → 1428.00] Unavailable.
[1428.00 → 1429.00] Subscriptions, unavailable.
[1429.00 → 1430.00] Notifications.
[1430.00 → 1431.00] Well, nothing.
[1431.00 → 1432.00] Privacy.
[1432.00 → 1433.00] Well, this is super private.
[1433.00 → 1434.00] Oh yeah.
[1434.00 → 1435.00] Super private.
[1435.00 → 1436.00] Yeah.
[1436.00 → 1437.00] Security.
[1437.00 → 1438.00] Literally all the private.
[1438.00 → 1439.00] Security through obscurity.
[1439.00 → 1440.00] That's what that is.
[1440.00 → 1441.00] Um.
[1441.00 → 1442.00] This is what like your-
[1442.00 → 1443.00] It was pretty hilarious.
[1443.00 → 1444.00] It was pretty hilarious when you-
[1444.00 → 1445.00] Yeah.
[1445.00 → 1447.00] Alright, so here's where you would like-
[1447.00 → 1452.00] And then here's where you put in the description, totally nonfunctional, but it will eventually.
[1452.00 → 1455.00] And then over here it's like, I was like, yes.
[1455.00 → 1456.00] This is the-
[1456.00 → 1457.00] Yeah, this is exactly-
[1457.00 → 1458.00] This is a bug.
[1458.00 → 1459.00] Yeah.
[1459.00 → 1460.00] Yeah.
[1460.00 → 1461.00] So this is a bug.
[1461.00 → 1463.00] This is a video that I was trying to upload like yesterday and-
[1463.00 → 1464.00] Now it's stuck here.
[1464.00 → 1465.00] Now it's just stuck.
[1465.00 → 1466.00] Yeah.
[1466.00 → 1468.00] And so I can't- you can't actually do any of this.
[1468.00 → 1470.00] Well the schedule change thing ISN't- isn't supposed to work right now.
[1470.00 → 1471.00] Yeah, I know.
[1471.00 → 1472.00] Don't worry about it man.
[1472.00 → 1473.00] Just try to imagine the potential.
[1473.00 → 1474.00] Click edit on one of these things.
[1474.00 → 1475.00] Imagine the potential.
[1475.00 → 1476.00] Okay.
[1476.00 → 1478.00] We got an edit button for videos that are uploaded.
[1478.00 → 1479.00] Yeah, that's new.
[1479.00 → 1480.00] So that was exciting.
[1480.00 → 1481.00] Oh, thank god.
[1481.00 → 1482.00] Oh, thank god we can edit them.
[1482.00 → 1483.00] You can change the thumbnail.
[1483.00 → 1484.00] Well I don't know if you can actually edit them.
[1484.00 → 1485.00] You can.
[1485.00 → 1486.00] Like there's no save button.
[1486.00 → 1487.00] Oh, well.
[1487.00 → 1488.00] There's no apply.
[1488.00 → 1490.00] Just-you can edit them, but you can't save any of your changes.
[1490.00 → 1493.00] You can save the changes on changing the thumbnail.
[1493.00 → 1494.00] So, you know.
[1494.00 → 1495.00] Hey!
[1495.00 → 1496.00] Some things are there.
[1496.00 → 1497.00] Hey, there's a save button.
[1497.00 → 1500.00] So, look, look, look, I'm not- I'm not giving you crap-
[1500.00 → 1502.00] It's only been up for like a day.
[1502.00 → 1504.00] I'm not giving you crap.
[1504.00 → 1507.00] No, the point of this-
[1507.00 → 1509.00] It's like I haven't slept in weeks.
[1509.00 → 1511.00] Look, look-
[1511.00 → 1514.00] There's been some perfect development that has happened, okay?
[1514.00 → 1522.00] Okay, no, there is actually-so most of the work over the last year has been back-end work.
[1522.00 → 1523.00] There's been a- well, infrastructure.
[1523.00 → 1525.00] There's been a lot of infrastructure work that's happened.
[1525.00 → 1529.00] Because, guys, like, we are all about that back-end.
[1529.00 → 1531.00] So, check this out.
[1531.00 → 1533.00] This should be a much more impressive demo.
[1533.00 → 1537.00] This is Kyle's GTX 1070 Ti video.
[1537.00 → 1538.00] Click.
[1538.00 → 1539.00] What's cracking people?
[1539.00 → 1540.00] Welcome back to the channel.
[1540.00 → 1541.00] Hope you're all doing well.
[1541.00 → 1545.00] Today's video is going to be very haphazardly thrown together because I'm short on time.
[1545.00 → 1546.00] What else is new, Kyle?
[1546.00 → 1547.00] I know.
[1547.00 → 1548.00] So, Paul, you're in advance for that.
[1548.00 → 1552.00] But I still think the data that you're going to be seeing today is going to excite you.
[1552.00 → 1555.00] Like, is that how that's going to go down, dude?
[1555.00 → 1556.00] I just want to check with you.
[1556.00 → 1557.00] Nugatory.
[1557.00 → 1558.00] Yeah, okay.
[1558.00 → 1559.00] Nugatory?
[1559.00 → 1560.00] Okay, that's good.
[1560.00 → 1561.00] That's good.
[1561.00 → 1564.00] By the way, I love your profile picture.
[1564.00 → 1568.00] It is literally the best screenshot of me on the internet.
[1568.00 → 1572.00] I think Brandon actually tweeted me.
[1572.00 → 1576.00] He's like, this is by far the best video clip that you will ever produce in your life.
[1576.00 → 1577.00] I was like, okay, thanks.
[1577.00 → 1578.00] Thanks, Brandon.
[1578.00 → 1581.00] I don't want to shoot for the stars anymore.
[1581.00 → 1582.00] All right, I'm sorry.
[1582.00 → 1583.00] I'm sorry.
[1583.00 → 1584.00] But yeah.
[1584.00 → 1589.00] Now you just need to get, like, multiple versions of, like, alcohol things and have all
[1589.00 → 1592.00] of them hit you in the eye at the same time.
[1592.00 → 1593.00] Yes.
[1593.00 → 1597.00] Paul and I did an online contest for Awesome Hardware recently.
[1597.00 → 1598.00] Oh, no.
[1598.00 → 1602.00] One of my personal favourites is actually on my store right now.
[1602.00 → 1607.00] It's sort of like a carbonized or animated version of that screenshot, and it says,
[1607.00 → 1609.00] beware of bottlenecks.
[1609.00 → 1610.96] Oh, that's pretty good.
[1610.98 → 1611.80] Oh, that's not bad.
[1611.82 → 1612.32] I like that.
[1612.84 → 1613.86] That's not bad.
[1615.00 → 1615.48] Huh.
[1616.28 → 1620.38] I wouldn't buy one, but if you sent it to me for free, I might consider wearing it.
[1621.20 → 1621.72] How about that?
[1622.16 → 1627.44] Yeah, you should wear it because I feel self-conscious wearing a shirt with my face on.
[1627.76 → 1629.18] It's very awkward.
[1629.52 → 1630.36] I don't like going in public.
[1630.72 → 1631.60] Oh, man.
[1632.20 → 1634.30] So anyway, there you guys go.
[1634.30 → 1637.00] I'm going to go ahead, and I'll link the store one more time.
[1637.00 → 1640.86] Here, I'll link specifically the Join Nitwit Ultra one.
[1641.36 → 1642.50] Go check it out.
[1643.06 → 1648.10] So you're doing one week early access, and I think you had also promised streaming,
[1648.36 → 1653.38] even though Luke and I were pretty clear that streaming doesn't work yet.
[1653.88 → 1658.12] But that's the last thing that I think Luke wants to update you on live.
[1658.72 → 1659.20] What?
[1659.64 → 1660.18] What am I up to you?
[1660.20 → 1661.10] You guys have been doing some testing.
[1661.32 → 1661.56] Yeah.
[1662.04 → 1662.56] Yeah.
[1663.56 → 1666.26] We've done some testing.
[1666.26 → 1666.62] Yeah.
[1666.70 → 1667.58] It's been going okay.
[1667.68 → 1669.02] There's still a lot of work that needs to be done.
[1669.34 → 1670.42] We're going to be working on it tonight.
[1670.62 → 1675.14] My little after-party stream is going to be streamed to Twitch and our own infrastructure,
[1675.32 → 1677.02] which is crazy.
[1677.56 → 1679.86] And we're going to see how that goes and do some stress testing.
[1680.44 → 1680.62] Yep.
[1681.04 → 1685.60] AJ was doing testing from, like, uploading to a server in Quebec.
[1686.14 → 1686.44] Yep.
[1686.44 → 1694.06] And then having that go over to the EU and then watching that stream off of an EU edge
[1694.06 → 1694.40] server.
[1694.62 → 1694.90] Yeah.
[1694.90 → 1696.96] That was, like, actually doing pretty well.
[1697.50 → 1697.64] Cool.
[1697.72 → 1699.34] We need to get multi-resolution working.
[1699.56 → 1700.78] We need to get a live chat.
[1701.28 → 1705.18] We need connected accounts working so that people can use their accounts to actually talk
[1705.18 → 1705.78] in the live chat.
[1706.00 → 1707.90] There's a bunch of work that still needs to be done.
[1707.90 → 1711.12] But, yeah, it's coming along.
[1712.96 → 1713.48] Cool.
[1713.82 → 1713.96] Yeah.
[1714.44 → 1715.36] Sounds promising.
[1715.58 → 1716.10] All right.
[1716.30 → 1718.36] Do you guys want to do some actual tech news?
[1719.16 → 1720.42] I mean, this was tech.
[1720.54 → 1721.50] And it was news.
[1721.66 → 1722.36] Tech news show.
[1722.84 → 1723.60] All right.
[1723.64 → 1727.06] So this was originally posted by Max Settings on the forum.
[1727.06 → 1731.32] And the original article is this YouTube video from NVIDIA.
[1731.50 → 1735.70] So everyone has to be quiet for a second here because I think the audience actually has sound
[1735.70 → 1736.80] off my laptop this week.
[1736.98 → 1738.32] So one moment here.
[1738.92 → 1739.50] Dun, dun, dun.
[1742.80 → 1743.70] Dun, dun, dun, dun.
[1744.48 → 1745.06] I don't know.
[1755.06 → 1756.68] It was red and green.
[1757.30 → 1757.52] Yeah.
[1757.60 → 1758.50] So it's probably RGB.
[1759.66 → 1760.04] Oh.
[1760.34 → 1760.58] Yeah.
[1761.50 → 1761.84] No, no.
[1761.96 → 1762.30] It's not.
[1762.52 → 1764.92] NVIDIA is not releasing a red graphics card.
[1764.92 → 1765.62] Hmm.
[1766.90 → 1770.88] So they released a teaser this morning for the new Titan X Collectors Edition.
[1771.34 → 1772.38] No mention of specs.
[1772.86 → 1778.94] It does look like a new cooler design with more lighting, with a green light clearly eliminating
[1778.94 → 1780.82] the vapour chamber and heat sink fin array.
[1781.36 → 1786.06] Lighting may be customizable because in a couple frames, there's a second glowing red graphics
[1786.06 → 1786.40] card.
[1786.84 → 1791.24] And it also seems like the fan could stick out from the frame with its own acrylic element.
[1791.24 → 1798.28] The scuttlebutt is that they could announce it at CES 2018, considering it has a scheduled
[1798.28 → 1799.32] keynote at the show.
[1800.12 → 1800.24] Okay, yeah.
[1800.24 → 1802.56] I actually doubt they would tease it two months ahead of time.
[1802.62 → 1803.84] It must be coming sooner than that.
[1804.70 → 1805.40] Yeah, I don't know.
[1805.58 → 1806.92] Kyle, does the world need another Titan?
[1806.92 → 1807.92] What is it?
[1807.92 → 1808.68] Um, no.
[1810.10 → 1810.50] Maybe.
[1811.22 → 1812.40] Someone's going to argue for it.
[1812.74 → 1814.02] I don't think we need one.
[1814.62 → 1815.26] So, what?
[1815.32 → 1824.00] We have the Titan X, the Titan X Pascal, the Titan XP, and the Titan X Collector's Edition.
[1825.46 → 1827.86] Like, I think it's stupid, but I also don't care.
[1828.06 → 1829.74] Like, if someone wants to buy it, sure, go ahead.
[1829.94 → 1830.32] I don't know.
[1830.32 → 1833.58] Wait, is it going to perform any different?
[1834.06 → 1834.80] No one knows.
[1835.48 → 1835.78] Okay.
[1836.54 → 1839.20] It might just be, like, an upgraded shroud.
[1839.80 → 1841.08] I mean, it is possible.
[1841.10 → 1841.94] It could just be an RGB.
[1842.70 → 1844.84] It's possible that this is Volta-based.
[1845.32 → 1845.62] Wait.
[1845.82 → 1846.68] It's possible.
[1847.58 → 1849.54] It says Titan X, not Titan XP, though.
[1851.98 → 1853.82] Yeah, but, like, I think...
[1853.82 → 1854.48] Oh, it doesn't have the P?
[1854.90 → 1855.24] Yeah.
[1856.70 → 1857.66] Ooh, yeah, you're right.
[1857.66 → 1859.44] 13-second video.
[1861.32 → 1863.12] Looks like the lighting could be customizable.
[1864.16 → 1865.24] Yeah, there's...
[1865.24 → 1866.50] We don't really know anything about it.
[1866.60 → 1869.40] Like, it is possible that this could be Volta-based.
[1869.54 → 1873.26] I mean, NVIDIA has had, obviously, working Volta hardware for months now.
[1873.58 → 1878.78] And just because AMD hasn't given them any compelling reason to release a better product
[1878.78 → 1882.78] within the price segments where they compete with them...
[1884.78 → 1887.10] Here's the real question.
[1887.10 → 1889.36] Linus, is the lighting RGB?
[1890.46 → 1891.80] It looks like it might be.
[1891.82 → 1892.36] Theoretically, yeah.
[1892.36 → 1894.74] But I don't see how that's the real question.
[1894.98 → 1895.58] I'm trying to talk to you.
[1895.58 → 1897.96] Well, no, that might matter a lot.
[1898.18 → 1901.18] See, the thing is, I don't know if people care about architecture anymore, as long as
[1901.18 → 1901.68] you've got lighting.
[1901.84 → 1902.76] Exactly, yeah.
[1902.76 → 1905.54] There are two fans for $100 that are selling.
[1906.82 → 1907.26] What?
[1907.36 → 1907.54] Really?
[1907.84 → 1908.04] Yeah.
[1908.04 → 1908.40] Thank you.
[1908.64 → 1908.66] What?
[1908.74 → 1910.02] Two fan package, $100.
[1910.50 → 1911.38] What fan is that?
[1912.36 → 1914.58] The light loops are $100 for two fans?
[1914.68 → 1915.04] Are they really?
[1915.88 → 1916.86] I actually didn't know that.
[1917.10 → 1918.96] Two 140mm fans.
[1919.12 → 1924.02] Of course, you get the Lighting Node Pro or whatever, the Lighting Node Pro, which, okay,
[1924.18 → 1926.72] makes you do pretty effects and stuff.
[1926.80 → 1928.68] But it's still two fans for $100.
[1929.64 → 1932.50] I bought it, like, last week and did a video on it.
[1932.80 → 1933.66] On Float plane.
[1933.84 → 1934.60] You bought it?
[1934.96 → 1935.80] It's a good video.
[1936.04 → 1936.70] It's on Float plane.
[1936.96 → 1937.36] Yeah, he did.
[1937.50 → 1938.00] He bought it.
[1938.24 → 1939.50] Does Corsair not like you?
[1940.12 → 1940.88] No, they do.
[1940.88 → 1941.62] It was...
[1941.62 → 1943.54] I wasn't planning to do any coverage on it.
[1943.66 → 1945.88] And then, impromptu, I was like, I need a video idea.
[1946.16 → 1948.50] I'm not planned out, like, buying it.
[1949.84 → 1953.70] So, I was like, I don't want to wait for Corsair to ship it and stuff, so I'll just buy
[1953.70 → 1955.46] it and pick it up the same day or whatever for New Egg.
[1955.70 → 1957.32] And did you get some sticker shock there?
[1958.88 → 1959.56] Somewhat?
[1960.00 → 1964.66] Did you know it was going to be $100 before you were like, oh, cool, let me fans.
[1965.14 → 1965.42] I did.
[1965.42 → 1965.72] I did.
[1965.84 → 1970.22] And I thought that's what made it an interesting video, because it was two fans for $100.
[1970.68 → 1972.92] Like, let's check them out and see what's the deal.
[1973.22 → 1974.62] It is genuinely a perfect video.
[1974.76 → 1975.52] I'm not going to lie.
[1975.64 → 1979.94] I'm not going to say why I did this, but I've seen it, like, six times or seven times.
[1980.40 → 1980.68] What?
[1981.48 → 1982.86] From beginning to end.
[1982.92 → 1984.28] I don't think I've watched it once.
[1984.46 → 1986.08] I can probably quote your video.
[1986.08 → 1989.20] I spent a Benjamin.
[1990.88 → 1991.24] Wow.
[1991.56 → 1991.92] See?
[1991.98 → 1992.46] On point.
[1992.64 → 1992.84] See?
[1992.90 → 1993.84] I confirmed, yeah.
[1993.84 → 1994.32] I got you.
[1994.46 → 1994.62] I can confirm.
[1996.82 → 1997.56] Freaking brilliant.
[1998.00 → 1998.62] It's crazy, man.
[1998.78 → 2003.18] I mean, I don't know if you guys, like, saw the, uh, it's kind of old now, but, like,
[2003.24 → 2007.76] the tempered glass RGB video was, like, a stupid sketch that I did a while back.
[2007.78 → 2009.20] I actually did see that one, yeah.
[2009.62 → 2013.40] It's, like, it's funny because it's, like, one of those, like, it's funny because it's true,
[2013.54 → 2015.74] but also kind of sad because it's true.
[2016.08 → 2023.06] Like, I have played up the RGB enthusiasm and all that.
[2023.16 → 2024.64] Like, I've had a lot of fun with it.
[2024.74 → 2026.78] And I've played both sides of the character.
[2027.36 → 2033.40] I've played the one who tries to build the anti-RGB computer by literally painting an entire
[2033.40 → 2035.28] computer, including the components black.
[2035.36 → 2036.28] I remember that one.
[2036.50 → 2037.78] Killing the motherboard in the process.
[2037.92 → 2038.78] Not a popular video.
[2038.98 → 2040.20] Not a fine moment for the channel.
[2040.20 → 2047.82] All the way to building the ultimate RGB PC, including me wearing RGB shoes for the build.
[2048.02 → 2050.72] Like, we've gone to both ends of the spectrum here.
[2051.58 → 2052.36] And, um...
[2052.36 → 2053.04] Pun intended.
[2053.04 → 2060.48] I have to confess, though, that I like RGB, like, in the sense that, like, I think it's
[2060.48 → 2061.80] cute and I think it's cool.
[2062.10 → 2062.30] Yeah.
[2062.30 → 2070.46] But I have a Corsair K70 RGB, like, their first RGB keyboard, on my desk at home.
[2070.46 → 2076.64] And the thing about that particular RGB keyboard is that it defaults back to its red, except
[2076.64 → 2082.06] for white on WAS and the arrows colour scheme every time you, like, unplug it or, like, don't
[2082.06 → 2083.22] install the driver or whatever.
[2083.52 → 2086.90] So there were a couple of times when I, like, bothered to set it up.
[2087.08 → 2087.24] Yeah.
[2087.30 → 2088.52] And then I got tired of it.
[2088.64 → 2094.14] And for well over a year, it's been red with white WAS because I just can't be arsed.
[2094.14 → 2094.74] Hmm.
[2095.10 → 2099.28] Well, I feel like with keyboards it's a little different because there's literally, like,
[2099.36 → 2104.80] over a hundred little things that you can configure and customize, right?
[2104.86 → 2106.48] It's like sensory overload.
[2107.48 → 2112.12] But I feel like if it's just more straightforward, it's like, okay, here's a headset or a motherboard.
[2112.26 → 2115.00] You're not going to have that many variations of what you can really do with it.
[2115.50 → 2119.04] And most people, like you said, like, most people are going to set it and forget it, right?
[2119.08 → 2120.24] Like, okay, I like this profile.
[2120.66 → 2121.32] I'm going to keep it.
[2121.56 → 2122.58] Just set it this way.
[2122.58 → 2125.86] And it's that way for, like, the next 18 months or whatever it is.
[2126.94 → 2128.58] So I don't know.
[2128.60 → 2131.44] But at the same time, like, I've gotten spoiled by RGB.
[2131.62 → 2132.84] Like, I think I realized I really...
[2132.84 → 2134.02] I don't know why everyone thinks it's me.
[2134.02 → 2137.90] Because I had the first generation of the K70 RGB as well.
[2138.12 → 2138.26] Yeah.
[2138.40 → 2140.00] And I was like, this is stupid.
[2140.08 → 2145.38] I'm not going to pay X amount for just having this lighting, and it can change colours and
[2145.38 → 2145.54] stuff.
[2145.60 → 2146.16] This is dumb.
[2146.40 → 2149.18] And then, like, the more updated, like, the next generation came out.
[2149.18 → 2153.78] And I was like, wow, like, the lighting's so much brighter, and it looks so much better.
[2154.30 → 2159.54] I'm like, why doesn't my stupid first generation board have, like, bright, vibrant RGB lighting?
[2159.58 → 2160.68] And I was like, oh, my God.
[2160.82 → 2161.38] Oh, my God.
[2161.44 → 2162.30] I like RGB lighting.
[2162.46 → 2162.68] Oh, my God.
[2162.68 → 2167.12] So you went from not caring to caring so much that you want premium RGB lighting.
[2167.12 → 2168.02] I went the other way around.
[2168.02 → 2168.04] Yeah.
[2168.04 → 2171.80] And, like, intellectually, I know it's dumb and gimmicky and stupid.
[2172.00 → 2174.38] But, like, my eyes are just like, give me more.
[2175.10 → 2176.56] It's like eye porn, you know?
[2176.74 → 2181.60] The funny thing is, like, I think the PC enthusiast takes a lot of flack for caring about RGB lighting.
[2181.84 → 2184.60] But then, for some reason...
[2184.60 → 2188.66] Actually, no, we do make fun of car enthusiasts for their big spoilers.
[2188.84 → 2189.24] Never mind.
[2189.88 → 2190.18] Okay.
[2190.34 → 2190.76] Forget it.
[2191.00 → 2191.94] Spoilers are just silly.
[2191.94 → 2197.46] The point I was trying to make died before it even finished getting out of my pocket.
[2198.40 → 2199.88] I was so excited for RGB.
[2199.90 → 2200.80] It tastes like rotting flesh.
[2201.10 → 2201.54] Wow.
[2202.30 → 2207.44] Back when, like, the ducky RGB was coming, ducky shine, I was so excited.
[2208.16 → 2209.92] And then, like, we got some in at work.
[2210.02 → 2212.94] I got to see the Corsair one early at CES and all this kind of stuff.
[2213.04 → 2217.96] And right when I saw it, I was like, oh, I don't know if I care.
[2218.34 → 2219.44] And then have never cared.
[2219.44 → 2221.72] My personal keyboard at home doesn't even have lights.
[2222.86 → 2223.54] I'm just like, nope.
[2223.68 → 2225.74] And even if it did, I have keycaps that cover them.
[2225.86 → 2227.34] And I would not swap out my keycaps.
[2227.46 → 2233.34] Because I prefer my PBT ninja-printed gold keycaps way over any lighter.
[2233.34 → 2234.14] You're such a dork.
[2234.76 → 2235.20] Absolutely.
[2235.40 → 2239.18] I feel like it's also one of those things where, like, if I didn't have...
[2239.18 → 2244.14] If I had, like, a keyboard that didn't have RGB, I'd prefer it to have zero lighting whatsoever.
[2245.02 → 2249.06] I think it's just when you give me one option, that's when I want more.
[2249.06 → 2254.00] But if you just give me no options, and it's not lit up at all, then I'll be like, oh, it's perfectly fine.
[2254.54 → 2257.42] But if you give me a keyboard that's just like, oh, you can only be red for...
[2257.42 → 2258.54] I'm like, well, why not green?
[2258.82 → 2259.32] Green's green.
[2260.04 → 2261.08] What the fuck, man?
[2261.26 → 2262.76] Why not red and green?
[2262.94 → 2264.32] Like, Christmas is almost here.
[2264.32 → 2266.86] I love how you can green, the like, least common...
[2266.86 → 2269.04] I'm going to put one of those coexist bumper stickers on my keyboard.
[2269.32 → 2269.56] Yeah.
[2270.18 → 2272.98] Speaking of green, this next topic.
[2273.10 → 2276.52] So we'll do one more topic, then we'll do our sponsors, and then you can bail if you want.
[2276.58 → 2279.36] Or you can sit through the sponsors if you're not too bored by them.
[2280.32 → 2283.98] Speaking of green, the Racer phone officially announced.
[2284.50 → 2286.36] Scrappy Dawn posted on the forum.
[2286.48 → 2287.04] Kyle, have you seen this?
[2287.10 → 2287.62] Have you heard about this?
[2288.10 → 2288.52] Racer phone?
[2288.60 → 2288.92] What?
[2289.40 → 2290.06] Yeah, yeah, the phone.
[2290.32 → 2290.54] Yeah, yeah, sure.
[2290.60 → 2291.10] Phone for gamers.
[2291.24 → 2291.68] It's for gamers.
[2291.72 → 2291.94] Totally.
[2292.36 → 2292.70] Totes.
[2292.70 → 2299.70] I've watched Austin's video on it, and I think I watched MKVHD's.
[2300.44 → 2300.70] Yep.
[2301.44 → 2303.60] I haven't watched anyone else's video on it, but yeah.
[2304.38 → 2304.98] All right.
[2305.48 → 2306.10] So thoughts.
[2306.48 → 2306.86] Hit me.
[2307.10 → 2308.18] Okay, actually, you know what, Luke?
[2308.24 → 2309.72] You look like you have something to say.
[2309.80 → 2311.08] You look like you want to go first.
[2312.38 → 2314.20] I'm so conflicted.
[2314.20 → 2316.16] People complain on this show that I never let you talk.
[2316.44 → 2318.04] You look like you need to talk right now.
[2318.10 → 2319.18] What do you have to say about the Racer phone?
[2319.18 → 2321.94] So I was just going to say, like, what are people playing on it?
[2321.94 → 2324.94] Because the first thing that jumped to my mind was, like, oh, Clash of Clans.
[2325.00 → 2326.76] And you don't need a gaming phone to play Clash of Clans.
[2327.04 → 2330.54] But then also, right after I said that, like, come on now.
[2330.58 → 2331.42] You don't need this.
[2331.62 → 2335.02] You need eight gigs to, like, build a castle in 18 months?
[2335.10 → 2335.98] Like, no, it's fine.
[2336.72 → 2338.72] But then I was at Twitch Con.
[2338.72 → 2345.58] The entire time that I was at Twitch Con, the like, biggest, most ridiculous booth was Lineage 2, which blew my freaking mind.
[2345.78 → 2347.88] Because I played that, like, before WoW came out.
[2348.18 → 2349.76] And I'm like, why are you here?
[2350.00 → 2350.26] Yeah.
[2350.72 → 2351.70] What the heck?
[2351.84 → 2352.32] Exactly.
[2352.82 → 2355.22] Like, that game from way before.
[2355.54 → 2358.26] I just assumed you were talking about something else entirely.
[2358.38 → 2358.62] No.
[2359.22 → 2361.58] But it's called, like, Ascension or something.
[2361.70 → 2362.78] And it's a mobile game.
[2363.14 → 2364.36] And it's, like, arena combat.
[2364.36 → 2366.86] I have no idea how all of this came together.
[2367.18 → 2367.60] But it was huge.
[2367.60 → 2368.28] What do you mean arena combat?
[2368.34 → 2369.02] It was an MMO.
[2369.14 → 2369.54] I know.
[2370.06 → 2372.04] I don't, all I saw was arena combat.
[2372.16 → 2373.84] It might have just been the PVP portion of the MMO.
[2373.84 → 2374.62] I'm not sure.
[2374.98 → 2376.72] But it's called Lineage 2 and then something.
[2377.08 → 2378.46] And it's this crazy phone game.
[2378.58 → 2379.94] And there's graphics all over the place and stuff.
[2380.30 → 2386.40] So maybe people that, like, decide that they need to play a PVP MMO on their phone?
[2389.74 → 2391.72] And, like, if they're targeting the right audience.
[2392.34 → 2392.94] Yeah, no, I know.
[2393.06 → 2393.56] That's a thing.
[2393.56 → 2400.12] And if they're targeting the right audience, apparently this Lineage 2 game is, like, top grossing in South Korea and Japan.
[2400.84 → 2401.28] Wow.
[2401.66 → 2407.34] And, like, they had Day 9 on stage the entire event and had Conan O'Brien up on stage with him at one point in time.
[2408.04 → 2410.72] Like, at Twitch Con, live, on stage.
[2411.34 → 2412.48] So they got money.
[2412.94 → 2413.80] Conan O'Brien?
[2414.20 → 2415.94] He's, like, still relevant, too.
[2416.30 → 2417.88] Like, that must have been a million dollars.
[2418.78 → 2419.68] It was a lot of money.
[2419.70 → 2421.56] Remember, there's a difference between...
[2421.56 → 2421.78] Okay.
[2421.78 → 2422.98] So...
[2422.98 → 2423.50] I love Day 9.
[2423.60 → 2425.72] Well, you know how much Clash of Clans brings in every day.
[2426.14 → 2426.62] Good lord.
[2427.10 → 2427.32] Yeah.
[2427.66 → 2429.32] Like, wow.
[2429.64 → 2429.98] Yeah.
[2430.10 → 2431.12] Like, that was...
[2431.12 → 2431.76] That's a weekend.
[2432.10 → 2437.10] The second I noticed that Day 9 was on stage all the time, I was like, that's really expensive.
[2437.46 → 2441.52] And then out of nowhere on, I think, Saturday, Conan's just up on stage with him.
[2441.60 → 2442.76] And I'm like...
[2442.76 → 2443.08] Good lord.
[2443.12 → 2443.52] That's...
[2443.52 → 2444.42] I don't care at all.
[2444.50 → 2444.70] Yeah.
[2444.74 → 2445.32] Because, like...
[2445.32 → 2445.92] Here's the thing.
[2446.04 → 2446.26] Yeah.
[2446.26 → 2449.46] Like, internet famous people have, like, appearance fees.
[2449.78 → 2451.32] Like, I'm not going to lie.
[2451.48 → 2454.62] Like, if someone is like, yeah, we really, really need you to be there.
[2454.68 → 2455.86] I'm like, well...
[2455.86 → 2456.78] Like, I have to travel.
[2457.04 → 2457.96] I'm away from home.
[2458.08 → 2458.84] I'm away from the office.
[2458.84 → 2459.60] I'm not working.
[2459.60 → 2460.60] Like, I...
[2460.60 → 2460.82] Yeah.
[2460.90 → 2461.42] I'm working.
[2461.62 → 2462.62] So, it costs money.
[2463.00 → 2469.04] But, like, my understanding is that for, like, A slash B list celebrities, like...
[2469.04 → 2470.04] Conan's a big deal.
[2470.08 → 2470.80] ...who are relevant.
[2471.16 → 2471.32] Yeah.
[2471.38 → 2474.74] Like, just to, like, talk is, like, a million bucks.
[2475.84 → 2476.24] Okay.
[2476.46 → 2476.66] Yeah.
[2477.10 → 2477.50] Potentially.
[2477.72 → 2477.98] Really?
[2478.16 → 2478.38] Yes.
[2478.68 → 2479.12] I don't know.
[2479.38 → 2479.90] Either way.
[2479.96 → 2481.00] Just, like, have a conversation.
[2481.02 → 2481.50] Huge deal, booth.
[2481.50 → 2482.26] And it was weird.
[2482.44 → 2483.12] Because you watch...
[2483.12 → 2486.20] You're at this booth, and everyone's extremely...
[2486.20 → 2486.88] They can't see me.
[2486.88 → 2490.72] Everyone's extremely seriously up on stage, like, Game Face, this whole team versus that
[2490.72 → 2491.00] whole team.
[2491.74 → 2492.34] On their phones.
[2493.12 → 2493.76] And I'm like, what?
[2493.88 → 2494.38] What the...
[2494.38 → 2496.22] What is this?
[2496.56 → 2498.50] So, like, apparently there's a market for it.
[2499.08 → 2499.44] Okay.
[2499.60 → 2500.72] And Racer's from where?
[2501.12 → 2501.66] Uh, Singapore.
[2501.66 → 2501.88] Singapore?
[2502.20 → 2502.36] Yeah.
[2502.44 → 2505.38] So, they're pretty close to where that game is grossing really highly.
[2505.68 → 2506.00] So...
[2506.00 → 2506.16] Yep.
[2507.50 → 2507.86] Okay.
[2508.02 → 2509.14] So, why don't we run...
[2509.14 → 2511.52] I'll run through the quick specs, and then let's hear your thoughts, Kyle.
[2511.76 → 2516.38] 5.7 inch, 1440p, sharp display.
[2516.88 → 2518.32] Uh, 120 hertz.
[2518.66 → 2519.64] That's a big deal.
[2520.14 → 2525.18] Like, obviously, I'm not gonna poo-poo them about that, because I made a huge deal of
[2525.18 → 2527.82] the latest iPad Pro having a 120 hertz.
[2527.82 → 2528.32] It is a big deal.
[2528.32 → 2529.80] Variable refresh rate display.
[2531.02 → 2531.74] Huge deal.
[2532.40 → 2533.00] Big fan.
[2533.38 → 2533.94] I love it.
[2534.02 → 2534.84] I love this move.
[2535.18 → 2539.34] Uh, some people in my stream chat, when I was talking about this, while they were doing
[2539.34 → 2543.04] it, were like, oh, that's stupid, because 120 hertz is just a waste of battery.
[2543.04 → 2544.18] Uh, no.
[2544.18 → 2548.06] It's variable refresh rate, so it refreshes when it needs to, so you could turn it down,
[2548.16 → 2551.14] you could save the power, or you could turn it up, you could have a butter-smooth experience.
[2551.32 → 2551.62] Fantastic.
[2551.62 → 2556.80] And I expect in games, it'll try to crank up, and in your, like, home screen, it's not going
[2556.80 → 2556.98] to.
[2557.04 → 2557.76] Love this move.
[2557.76 → 2558.12] Yeah, exactly.
[2558.32 → 2560.10] And the, and the battery's pretty massive.
[2560.22 → 2561.84] Isn't it like a thousand Williams or something like that?
[2561.96 → 2565.74] Four thousand William hour battery, so they're saying seven hours of gaming continuously.
[2566.06 → 2568.48] Eight gigs of RAM, 64 gig storage with expansion.
[2569.04 → 2574.42] Uh, stereo front-facing speakers with Dolby Atmos, though I'm not especially convinced that
[2574.42 → 2578.88] Dolby Atmos has a ton of value when you have a stereo speaker configuration, so I'm not sure.
[2579.36 → 2583.34] Snapdragon 835, and they're saying because of their cooling, it's the best-performing
[2583.34 → 2584.88] Snapdragon 835 on the market.
[2585.34 → 2586.30] How thick is the phone?
[2586.30 → 2591.06] It's, it's not thin, but it's not like a completely ridiculous brick either.
[2591.22 → 2593.70] It's not that, it's not that far off what I would consider reasonable.
[2594.06 → 2594.86] No headphone jack.
[2594.86 → 2596.58] It's only got like 120 mid.
[2597.98 → 2600.76] 700 bucks, no headphone jack.
[2600.94 → 2601.80] Okay, Kyle, go.
[2601.94 → 2603.08] Headphone jack, yay or nay?
[2604.50 → 2605.50] Is this a dealbreaker for you?
[2605.52 → 2610.74] Honestly, it's, it's, it's one of those things where I have just, like, every phone that
[2610.74 → 2614.32] I've ever had, even like super crappy headphone jack.
[2614.32 → 2620.28] So, psychologically, it weirds me out to think about using a phone daily that doesn't have
[2620.28 → 2620.52] one.
[2620.52 → 2625.60] But when I think about it realistically, in the last, like, six to 12 months, with my
[2625.60 → 2630.52] Google Pixel, first generation, like, I have probably used that jack once.
[2630.52 → 2631.64] Really?
[2631.64 → 2633.90] And so, logistically, like, yeah.
[2635.14 → 2636.60] I have a Pixel XL version.
[2637.02 → 2639.82] And that's, and that's why it's a never-ending discussion, is because it really just boils
[2639.82 → 2640.54] down to the end.
[2641.08 → 2646.24] Are you someone who uses a wired, like wired headphones or earbuds with your phone?
[2646.88 → 2647.30] You know?
[2647.30 → 2648.92] You know, and I typically don't.
[2649.24 → 2653.24] You know, I, when I listen to music, I am either on my desktop, and I've got, you know,
[2653.30 → 2658.76] my, my cans there, or I'm in the car and, and I'm using Bluetooth.
[2659.12 → 2662.56] So, for me, it's, it's one of those things that I could live without.
[2662.72 → 2666.90] It's nice to have, but it's not necessary for me personally.
[2666.90 → 2670.46] But I completely understand how some people value that sort of thing.
[2670.52 → 2674.54] Especially, like, you know, when you get onto the, uh, audiophile spectrum and, you know,
[2674.56 → 2679.50] you're, you're having, uh, phones like the like, what's LG's latest one with the DAC
[2679.50 → 2679.80] in it?
[2679.86 → 2680.04] Yep.
[2680.22 → 2681.10] Yeah, the, the V30.
[2681.46 → 2682.48] So, I mean, yeah, I get it.
[2682.54 → 2682.96] I get it.
[2683.00 → 2684.70] You know, pushing it forward and stuff like that.
[2684.82 → 2689.08] But for me personally, I, it's something that I could do without assuming that the rest
[2689.08 → 2691.70] of the phone is exactly what I'm looking for.
[2692.70 → 2696.74] Especially with certain mobile gaming titles coming out with, like, voice chat and
[2696.74 → 2697.48] stuff built in.
[2697.64 → 2697.90] Yep.
[2698.96 → 2703.70] Like, the, the need to be on headphones actually sounds pretty major.
[2704.36 → 2707.66] And I know there's a big battery, but they're talking about a gaming phone.
[2707.84 → 2708.88] I know they say seven hours.
[2709.16 → 2710.10] That's going to go down.
[2710.16 → 2712.46] Yeah, if you're using a Bluetooth headset, that goes down for sure.
[2712.46 → 2712.58] Yeah.
[2712.74 → 2715.48] And that's going to go down over usage of the phone as well.
[2715.50 → 2715.70] Yep.
[2716.08 → 2716.42] Yeah, that's true.
[2716.42 → 2718.52] And the more you load it up with stuff, you add voice chat in.
[2718.58 → 2719.80] That's more things that need to be processed.
[2719.80 → 2722.18] Like, I'm using my headphone jack right now.
[2722.38 → 2722.68] Yeah.
[2722.94 → 2724.08] To listen to you, Kyle.
[2724.08 → 2728.32] So you might say that I'm not really, I might be better off without it.
[2728.32 → 2728.98] That's a really sad argument.
[2729.30 → 2730.64] That's a really sad case.
[2730.68 → 2731.04] Wow.
[2731.94 → 2732.34] Wow.
[2733.74 → 2735.10] But for better or for...
[2735.10 → 2738.10] But like I said, it's one of those things where you're really not going to care much
[2738.10 → 2740.60] or you're going to be, like, desperately in need of it.
[2741.30 → 2743.54] There's, I feel like there's zero gray area here.
[2743.54 → 2750.10] With that said, I have gotten used to not having a headphone jack, mostly.
[2750.64 → 2752.68] Because I've been working on my Pixel 2 review.
[2753.16 → 2756.08] I was working on my review of the iPhone 8 and the 8 Plus.
[2756.70 → 2757.72] There's at least one other...
[2757.72 → 2760.32] Yeah, I was working on my review of the Xiaomi Mi Mix 2.
[2760.54 → 2763.40] And these are all phones that don't have headphone jacks.
[2763.40 → 2770.48] And I'm just used to now carrying around this weird, stupid multi-dongle adapter thing
[2770.48 → 2774.64] that I built myself so that I just have something on hand at all times.
[2774.78 → 2775.06] Shut up.
[2775.06 → 2776.86] I didn't know you strapped it all together.
[2777.54 → 2778.84] Yeah, because this way...
[2778.84 → 2780.62] You, like, made your own multi-cable.
[2781.04 → 2783.12] So I can run this one through here.
[2783.72 → 2784.68] And then the whole thing...
[2784.68 → 2784.74] Oh, wow.
[2785.42 → 2786.32] Oh, wow.
[2786.36 → 2788.06] No, actually, this was not my idea.
[2788.40 → 2789.20] This was...
[2789.20 → 2793.66] This came with the Motor Z Force.
[2794.20 → 2794.54] Okay.
[2794.62 → 2795.72] And I liberated it.
[2796.04 → 2796.38] And then I...
[2796.38 → 2796.74] That was included.
[2796.98 → 2799.60] I came up with the idea of putting multiple adapters on it.
[2799.84 → 2799.86] Nice.
[2799.86 → 2801.42] So that's all that I contributed to this.
[2801.56 → 2803.52] I tried to find one to buy.
[2804.00 → 2805.78] Because I was like, I should get some spares of these.
[2805.84 → 2806.08] Yeah.
[2806.42 → 2807.20] And I couldn't.
[2807.20 → 2809.50] I don't even know what to search for on Amazon.
[2809.68 → 2809.96] What would you call it?
[2810.08 → 2810.20] Yeah.
[2810.50 → 2812.20] Like, the dongle holder.
[2812.20 → 2812.76] Dongle holder.
[2813.02 → 2815.50] Dongle holder headphone adapter pro.
[2816.24 → 2816.64] Waterproof.
[2817.06 → 2819.36] We should do it as, like, an LTT merch item.
[2819.80 → 2820.06] Yeah.
[2820.20 → 2820.68] That'd be cool.
[2820.80 → 2822.26] Just, like, get, like, 5,000 of them.
[2822.40 → 2822.94] Maybe, like, yep.
[2823.06 → 2823.28] Yep.
[2823.28 → 2823.92] We invented this.
[2823.92 → 2825.04] Like Kyle's fidget spinner.
[2825.22 → 2828.12] We invented this out of Motorola's included accessories.
[2828.32 → 2829.44] Did you really do a fidget spinner?
[2830.18 → 2830.66] I did.
[2830.84 → 2831.50] You're a monster.
[2832.18 → 2832.84] And they sold miraculously.
[2832.84 → 2833.36] They sold out, didn't they?
[2833.42 → 2833.64] Yeah.
[2834.28 → 2834.64] Yeah.
[2834.64 → 2835.34] They sold so well.
[2835.98 → 2836.24] Yeah.
[2837.12 → 2837.88] But you know what?
[2837.94 → 2839.50] I haven't replenished them.
[2839.62 → 2841.78] As soon as they sold out, that was the only stock.
[2841.78 → 2843.64] Because that's literally about how long that happened.
[2844.24 → 2844.56] Yeah.
[2844.56 → 2844.84] Yeah.
[2844.90 → 2846.06] That would have been pretty risky.
[2847.16 → 2847.48] Yeah.
[2847.80 → 2848.24] Oh, yeah.
[2849.60 → 2850.06] All right.
[2850.12 → 2851.04] So, there you go.
[2851.18 → 2851.78] Racer phone.
[2852.58 → 2853.76] I had a lot of people.
[2853.76 → 2853.88] Okay.
[2853.94 → 2854.28] I don't know.
[2854.28 → 2854.58] Hold up.
[2854.62 → 2855.80] I don't know where people are getting this from.
[2855.88 → 2857.56] There's some people in chat being like, this is so annoying.
[2857.66 → 2858.64] They said it's not a gaming phone.
[2858.80 → 2859.24] Yes, they did.
[2859.24 → 2859.88] No, we didn't.
[2859.88 → 2860.98] We didn't say it's not a gaming phone.
[2860.98 → 2861.18] Oh.
[2861.44 → 2863.28] I thought they were saying Racer said it's not a gaming phone.
[2863.28 → 2863.76] It's totally a gaming phone.
[2863.84 → 2863.94] Oh.
[2863.98 → 2864.86] Yeah, it's totally a gaming phone.
[2864.86 → 2866.18] Who said it's not a gaming phone?
[2866.18 → 2867.96] I don't know where the chat sort of got that from.
[2868.50 → 2869.22] It's a gaming phone.
[2869.24 → 2869.96] Yeah, it's a gaming phone.
[2870.08 → 2871.40] Everyone agrees it's a gaming phone.
[2871.68 → 2871.84] Yeah.
[2872.04 → 2875.32] We don't know why it's a gaming phone other than the high refresh rate display.
[2875.68 → 2877.04] And that Racer said it is.
[2877.08 → 2877.64] It's got some RAM.
[2877.92 → 2878.16] Yeah.
[2878.30 → 2878.62] Battery.
[2879.90 → 2882.32] Yeah, but it doesn't have, like, okay, this is the...
[2882.32 → 2884.76] Okay, I find Racer very frustrating sometimes.
[2885.06 → 2887.20] And this is not because they didn't send me a phone.
[2887.54 → 2889.28] And they did send some to other tech YouTubers.
[2889.62 → 2890.74] That's not why I'm upset.
[2890.74 → 2893.56] I did have a call with them about that.
[2894.18 → 2895.80] So we definitely talked about it.
[2896.16 → 2897.24] But, yeah, it's all good.
[2897.46 → 2899.38] I'm not salty, but I did blow up their facility.
[2900.20 → 2902.30] Yeah, which is why I'm not salty anymore.
[2902.36 → 2906.84] Oh, apparently they're upset because they called it a phone for gamers, not a gaming phone.
[2907.54 → 2908.34] Wow, I don't care.
[2908.56 → 2908.96] Wow.
[2909.02 → 2911.72] Okay, so the problem with...
[2911.72 → 2914.16] So Racer frustrates me sometimes because they do this stuff.
[2914.42 → 2919.80] They're like, and it has the most amazing battery, the best battery,
[2919.80 → 2921.46] the biggest battery in a flagship phone.
[2921.46 → 2922.22] My friends called me.
[2922.22 → 2923.28] They said it's an amazing battery.
[2923.28 → 2924.42] They said it's an amazing battery.
[2924.48 → 2925.80] And he really did sound like that.
[2925.82 → 2926.38] A triumphant...
[2926.38 → 2927.88] Like, did you watch the keynote, Kyle?
[2928.44 → 2928.80] Amazing.
[2929.08 → 2930.02] Wait, did I watch what?
[2930.56 → 2932.04] A tremendous battery.
[2932.66 → 2933.66] No, I did not watch the keynote.
[2934.06 → 2934.12] No.
[2934.12 → 2934.46] Okay.
[2934.70 → 2936.62] It's pretty amazing.
[2936.96 → 2937.50] It's tremendous.
[2938.14 → 2938.90] It's the best.
[2939.30 → 2942.66] Anyway, the point is they're just like...
[2942.66 → 2945.70] And then they show how big the battery is, and it's 4,000 William hours.
[2945.70 → 2952.14] And I was like, okay, you do realize that the Galaxy S8 Active is arguably a flagship phone
[2952.14 → 2953.70] because it's a Galaxy S8.
[2954.38 → 2957.76] Oh, and by the way, it has a 4,000 William hour battery.
[2958.18 → 2960.70] So yes, while technically you do have...
[2961.30 → 2963.90] Oh, and also it ignores the Mate 10, so that's a whole other thing.
[2964.52 → 2967.98] But you could make the argument that if they're not competing in the same markets,
[2967.98 → 2970.36] then it's the biggest in a flagship phone.
[2970.40 → 2970.84] No, no.
[2970.90 → 2972.36] There's no way to defend this.
[2972.36 → 2978.18] So there was a lot of embellishment, and Racer does tend to do these things.
[2978.28 → 2982.54] I actually have a bit come to my upcoming review of the Racer Blade 4K,
[2983.22 → 2990.18] where there were three things in their reviewer's guide that ranged from misleading to outright false.
[2991.10 → 2991.56] Nice.
[2991.94 → 2993.98] And I'm just sitting here going, what are you guys even doing?
[2995.28 → 2995.94] That's good.
[2996.14 → 2996.78] Do your job.
[2996.92 → 2997.98] There are a lot of companies that do that.
[2997.98 → 2998.48] Look it up.
[2998.66 → 2999.20] There are a lot of companies.
[2999.20 → 2999.82] Come on.
[2999.82 → 3006.80] Yeah, I was finding it particularly cringeworthy during the stream the other day.
[3008.58 → 3012.28] Apparently the P2 has a 5,100 William hour battery, so there's that.
[3012.40 → 3013.04] You know what, though?
[3013.12 → 3018.74] I don't want to take anything away from them about the front-facing speakers and the 120Hz display.
[3018.92 → 3019.76] Both of those are very cool.
[3019.84 → 3025.04] Both of those things make it enough of a gaming phone that I'm not going to ran them too hard.
[3025.04 → 3027.48] Yeah, I agree.
[3027.66 → 3033.42] I think the refresh rate, I mean, there's so much emphasis on pixel pushing.
[3033.72 → 3036.68] Like, we have the highest resolution phone ever.
[3036.98 → 3038.18] No, we have the highest resolution.
[3038.20 → 3040.00] And, like, everyone forgets about refresh rate.
[3040.52 → 3040.62] Yes.
[3040.62 → 3044.46] So it's kind of cool to see a company like Racer, who's always been sort of more gamer-centric,
[3045.02 → 3048.88] to come in and be like, look, pixel count isn't the only thing that matters, you noobs.
[3049.04 → 3050.72] And, you know, actually do something about it.
[3050.74 → 3051.28] So that's cool.
[3051.28 → 3053.06] I do appreciate that.
[3053.36 → 3058.08] It did drive me pretty crazy when they were talking about how this was the first mobile device
[3058.08 → 3060.20] with a variable refresh rate 120Hz display.
[3060.40 → 3063.68] Because the last time I checked, the iPad Pro is technically not a phone,
[3064.16 → 3066.26] but it's definitely a mobile device.
[3068.40 → 3070.82] Everything's a mobile device if you try hard.
[3070.90 → 3071.50] That's true.
[3071.68 → 3079.08] Technically, a desktop is a mobile device if you're willing to sort of put the saddlebags on the pony.
[3079.08 → 3080.98] You should do a tech quick.
[3081.56 → 3082.78] It's a mobile device.
[3082.96 → 3083.32] Yeah.
[3083.48 → 3084.30] Oh, Lord.
[3084.64 → 3087.28] Well, people in chat are asking, what is a gaming phone?
[3087.48 → 3089.78] I think a 120Hz phone is a gaming phone right now.
[3089.86 → 3090.06] Yeah.
[3090.10 → 3090.72] I think that's fair.
[3090.80 → 3090.98] Yeah.
[3091.08 → 3091.26] Yeah.
[3091.36 → 3092.30] It's got extra RAM.
[3092.56 → 3093.76] It's got extra battery life.
[3093.86 → 3096.56] It's got a nice screen, forward-facing speakers.
[3096.72 → 3098.08] You can sit there and play your thing.
[3098.16 → 3098.30] Sure.
[3098.42 → 3102.86] I mean, I can see why people are upset about no headphone jack on a gaming phone.
[3102.86 → 3102.94] Gaming phone.
[3103.06 → 3106.06] Also, Racer's camera looks pretty trash.
[3106.16 → 3107.92] They just want you to be really obnoxious on the train.
[3107.92 → 3108.88] From the demo shots.
[3109.08 → 3109.56] Yeah.
[3109.56 → 3111.24] And they didn't really...
[3111.24 → 3111.38] Okay.
[3111.46 → 3114.66] I did tune out of the stream before it was completely over, but they didn't really talk about the
[3114.66 → 3119.62] front-facing camera at all during the meat of the announcement.
[3119.68 → 3120.66] Not a selfie phone.
[3120.68 → 3121.16] That bad, huh?
[3121.86 → 3122.74] Well, I don't know.
[3122.80 → 3128.20] Maybe it's great, but I would expect a gaming phone to have a great front-facing camera.
[3130.44 → 3130.70] Why?
[3130.76 → 3130.96] Yeah.
[3131.32 → 3131.72] Streaming?
[3131.86 → 3132.40] Yeah, streaming.
[3132.56 → 3132.82] Streaming.
[3132.82 → 3133.36] Yeah, for streaming.
[3133.58 → 3133.70] Yeah.
[3133.70 → 3134.14] Yeah.
[3134.14 → 3134.36] Yeah.
[3134.36 → 3137.58] I would expect the front-facing camera to be, like, as good as the rear shooter.
[3137.90 → 3140.78] If you're going to say, yep, this is, like, the gaming phone.
[3141.02 → 3141.20] Yeah.
[3141.86 → 3142.54] So, we'll see.
[3142.70 → 3143.18] That makes sense.
[3144.04 → 3144.60] All right.
[3144.76 → 3146.60] So, we have to do our sponsors now.
[3146.82 → 3148.24] So, Kyle, did you want to peace out?
[3148.34 → 3151.18] I know we've kept you an hour and a half after when you said you had to go.
[3151.30 → 3152.78] Or do you want to hang around and chill with us?
[3152.78 → 3156.44] Guys, as much as I enjoy you, probably going to have to bow out.
[3156.76 → 3157.16] All right.
[3157.72 → 3159.94] So, one last time, guys.
[3160.16 → 3163.06] Kyle is now available on float plane.
[3163.88 → 3164.74] It's the best.
[3164.74 → 3164.78] Yeah.
[3164.78 → 3164.94] Or me, I think.
[3164.94 → 3165.84] The best float plane.
[3166.20 → 3167.32] The best float plane.
[3167.46 → 3168.06] It's the greatest.
[3168.30 → 3170.04] It's insane, this float plane.
[3170.92 → 3171.30] Do it.
[3171.30 → 3171.58] Insane.
[3172.20 → 3176.16] I mean, at being a plane that can float, it's pretty bad.
[3176.42 → 3180.54] But at being a website that streams things, I mean, it also doesn't exist yet.
[3180.54 → 3184.30] But at serving video through a forum, we're doing pretty good.
[3184.42 → 3184.60] Yeah.
[3184.86 → 3185.10] Yeah.
[3185.92 → 3187.62] So, you can head over there.
[3187.64 → 3187.80] Well said, Cliff.
[3187.86 → 3188.22] Well said.
[3188.46 → 3188.68] Yeah.
[3188.84 → 3189.72] You can head over there.
[3190.10 → 3192.92] So, you're aiming for one-week Windows on your content.
[3193.12 → 3194.12] So, one-week early access.
[3194.22 → 3194.62] Is that correct?
[3195.34 → 3196.14] That is true.
[3196.88 → 3197.64] So, there you go, guys.
[3197.68 → 3198.26] Go check it out.
[3198.36 → 3198.96] Nitwit Ultra.
[3199.72 → 3202.36] And you can see the video that we were talking about earlier.
[3202.56 → 3205.30] The best RGB fans on the market.
[3206.02 → 3206.64] The best.
[3206.88 → 3207.58] What's going on, guys?
[3207.58 → 3208.38] Welcome back to the channel.
[3208.50 → 3209.68] Hope you're all doing well.
[3209.68 → 3210.68] Today I am taking a-
[3210.68 → 3211.20] It's a good video.
[3211.32 → 3211.86] It's a good video.
[3212.02 → 3215.04] And I will say I enjoyed your testing as well.
[3215.26 → 3215.62] That's good.
[3216.52 → 3217.18] Oh, thanks, Luke.
[3217.70 → 3217.90] Yeah.
[3218.06 → 3219.36] See, this is why I like you more longs.
[3219.48 → 3220.34] Do you see that buffering?
[3220.50 → 3222.04] Do you see how fast that video is buffering?
[3222.16 → 3223.76] Okay, arguably we're on 360p.
[3223.84 → 3224.04] Yeah.
[3224.10 → 3225.60] So, I did mention that earlier.
[3225.66 → 3226.58] I'm cheating a little bit.
[3226.72 → 3227.44] I'm cheating a little bit.
[3227.54 → 3227.96] Even better.
[3228.12 → 3228.86] We're at 140p.
[3228.86 → 3229.52] Look at how fast.
[3229.96 → 3230.38] Look at that buffers.
[3230.38 → 3230.68] Still.
[3230.68 → 3231.08] Still.
[3231.20 → 3231.58] Come on.
[3231.74 → 3232.28] Come on, baby.
[3232.52 → 3233.98] Look at that responsive player.
[3234.24 → 3235.34] Look at that responsive player.
[3235.44 → 3235.92] Isn't that beautiful?
[3235.92 → 3236.22] Yeah.
[3236.22 → 3236.86] Isn't it beautiful?
[3237.06 → 3237.22] Yeah.
[3237.22 → 3241.92] Okay, I'll stop pimping, Kyle, and I'll stop pimping Float plane right now.
[3242.56 → 3243.24] All right.
[3243.42 → 3246.94] And I will start pimping our sponsors for the WAN show today.
[3247.02 → 3247.18] All right.
[3247.24 → 3247.66] See you, Kyle.
[3248.26 → 3248.98] Bye, guys.
[3249.08 → 3249.36] Thanks.
[3249.76 → 3250.08] Bye.
[3252.82 → 3253.84] All right.
[3254.72 → 3258.26] So, number one is Synergy.
[3259.66 → 3260.36] Oh, my goodness.
[3260.66 → 3261.74] Can you believe how late it is?
[3261.84 → 3262.24] I'm sorry.
[3262.42 → 3263.32] You can leave, too, if you want.
[3263.32 → 3264.02] It's so late.
[3264.10 → 3264.26] No.
[3264.56 → 3265.52] I will stay.
[3265.52 → 3271.52] Synergy is the solution to your problem of having multiple computers with multiple keyboards
[3271.52 → 3274.26] and mice and not wanting to do that anymore.
[3274.44 → 3274.88] Get out of here.
[3274.88 → 3275.84] Yeah, you don't need that anymore.
[3275.94 → 3277.30] This is terrible.
[3277.32 → 3277.72] Oh, I know.
[3278.78 → 3284.52] Those headphones, I mean, they're like, they literally are like the communal bicycle, except
[3284.52 → 3286.06] the communal monitors.
[3286.26 → 3286.86] They're pretty OG.
[3286.96 → 3287.92] I'm going to take them back to the room.
[3287.92 → 3289.80] Like, those are pretty used AF.
[3289.80 → 3290.78] They've been around for a long time.
[3290.78 → 3291.02] Yeah.
[3292.34 → 3296.36] Synergy lets you use one keyboard and mouse across multiple computers.
[3296.52 → 3300.32] You just literally drag your mouse across the screens after you configure Synergy and
[3300.32 → 3302.56] you just kind of say where all of your displays are.
[3302.92 → 3306.36] And boom, you're using a different computer and the keyboard works with that one now.
[3306.60 → 3308.02] You can even drag and drop files.
[3308.16 → 3309.24] You can copy and paste.
[3309.24 → 3313.88] The pro version includes encryption for the data that's passed between the computers.
[3314.46 → 3319.20] And in my opinion, the coolest thing about Synergy is that it is cross-platform.
[3319.64 → 3322.28] Windows, Mac, and Linux.
[3324.60 → 3330.18] So whether you have like a gaming box and a separate dev box or whether you, you know,
[3330.74 → 3335.48] run apps that are only available on Mac, and then you also have ones that are only available
[3335.48 → 3336.04] on Windows.
[3336.04 → 3340.34] My biggest thing every time is if you have a laptop for work, a lot of people do that
[3340.34 → 3340.74] these days.
[3340.80 → 3345.90] You have a laptop for work, you take it home, you just plunk her down, turn it on, you're
[3345.90 → 3346.36] already done.
[3347.06 → 3347.30] Yep.
[3347.94 → 3348.42] Pretty cool.
[3348.88 → 3354.32] So it all runs over the network and you guys can head over to seamlesssymless.com slash
[3354.32 → 3359.94] synergy slash WAN2 and you can save 50% on Synergy today.
[3360.36 → 3361.56] That's some serious discount.
[3361.56 → 3363.08] That is some serious discount.
[3363.20 → 3364.26] And you know what's not discounted?
[3364.44 → 3364.72] Squarespace.
[3365.38 → 3365.70] Whoa.
[3365.70 → 3366.68] Except that it is.
[3366.82 → 3367.08] Oh.
[3367.60 → 3367.88] What a curveball.
[3367.88 → 3369.66] Unless you don't use our code.
[3370.90 → 3371.26] Wow.
[3371.42 → 3371.74] Wow.
[3372.18 → 3372.64] So rude.
[3372.64 → 3374.92] Squarespace lets you build your own beautiful website.
[3375.10 → 3379.86] Just pick one of their great templates and boom, you put in your pictures, you put in your
[3379.86 → 3380.24] text.
[3380.54 → 3385.18] You can actually have a site up in a matter of minutes if you just want one of those simple
[3385.18 → 3386.06] one-page sites.
[3386.54 → 3391.62] It's all cloud-based, so there's no like, oh no, I forgot to upload that thing or whatever.
[3391.62 → 3397.02] You just go ahead, make all your changes, click save and instantly your site is visible to anyone
[3397.02 → 3397.82] on the web.
[3397.94 → 3401.00] And they have been extraordinarily reliable for us.
[3401.40 → 3405.62] I don't think I have ever gotten a complaint that linusmediagroup.com has been down in the
[3405.62 → 3406.88] last four years.
[3406.88 → 3409.16] And we've tried to like intentionally bring it down.
[3409.16 → 3412.58] Oh yeah, we've tried to Fergus it by being like, okay, everyone on WAN show, go hit it
[3412.58 → 3412.86] now.
[3413.20 → 3414.42] We've seen it slow down.
[3415.00 → 3416.60] For like a second.
[3416.60 → 3421.50] But it actually is usually like, okay, I'm good.
[3421.72 → 3421.82] Yeah.
[3422.22 → 3422.38] Yeah.
[3423.06 → 3426.60] So Squarespace starts at just $12 a month.
[3426.74 → 3431.48] Your site looks great on any device because they feature, because all their templates feature
[3431.48 → 3432.34] responsive design.
[3432.46 → 3436.04] So whether it's a desktop, laptop, or even a mobile device, it'll look awesome.
[3436.44 → 3442.68] And they've got tons of great modules built in like commerce, which actually now includes
[3442.68 → 3443.78] extra information.
[3443.78 → 3447.62] It's not in my notes here, but actually the commerce module has been upgraded.
[3448.34 → 3451.06] So the commerce module now includes, oh, we have to pull that up.
[3451.08 → 3452.50] Is that a Squarespace site that someone built?
[3452.80 → 3453.10] No.
[3453.34 → 3453.82] Oh, okay.
[3453.88 → 3454.28] Never mind.
[3454.54 → 3455.80] Should we pull up Lupus wrong?
[3455.92 → 3456.48] No, we shouldn't.
[3456.52 → 3456.96] Oh, okay.
[3457.02 → 3457.20] Never mind.
[3457.20 → 3458.34] There's a new reason why we should.
[3458.92 → 3459.28] Oh.
[3459.74 → 3459.92] Yeah.
[3460.22 → 3461.14] I will show you in a moment.
[3461.24 → 3461.74] Oh, okay.
[3461.82 → 3469.24] Well, at any rate, head over to squarespace.com slash WAN and use offer code WAN to save 10%.
[3469.24 → 3477.44] Which leads us to our last sponsor who is actually giving away three different models.
[3478.00 → 3482.14] Three models of their desktop Z-Box mini PCs.
[3482.80 → 3485.32] So they're giving, this is Total, and they're, wow, this is awesome.
[3485.66 → 3487.96] They're giving away one PI-225.
[3487.96 → 3490.08] So this guy is fanless.
[3490.24 → 3496.86] So zero noise, two USB 3 ports, wireless AC, an Intel N3350 processor.
[3497.02 → 3497.96] I believe that's quad-core.
[3498.18 → 3500.54] And four gigs of LPDDR3 memory.
[3500.68 → 3502.62] So super compact fanless machine.
[3502.90 → 3504.14] I was going to say, one of the really cool.
[3504.24 → 3505.86] And it's the size of a two and a half inch SSD.
[3506.34 → 3506.58] Yeah.
[3506.92 → 3510.34] One of the really cool things about this thing is it's so freaking tiny.
[3510.34 → 3519.50] This is, I believe, the successor to the one that I used when I was trying to do the build a PC in a fridge project.
[3520.10 → 3520.58] Oh, really?
[3520.64 → 3520.78] Yeah.
[3520.80 → 3523.40] Remember that super tiny one that they had that was kind of plastique?
[3523.56 → 3525.50] This one looks a lot nicer, actually.
[3526.38 → 3527.26] It's really sharp.
[3528.64 → 3528.86] Cool.
[3528.98 → 3534.02] It kind of looks, in a slightly nostalgic way, it kind of looks like a, I don't know.
[3534.04 → 3535.26] It looks like a battery bank.
[3535.42 → 3537.12] It looks like a lot of different things, to be fair.
[3537.12 → 3542.84] This looks like a like, it doesn't look like it at all, but like a 3.5-inch floppy with the like, slide thing on top.
[3542.92 → 3543.58] I see your point.
[3543.72 → 3544.96] I see where you're coming from.
[3545.14 → 3546.90] Like, no, but also sort of.
[3547.00 → 3549.20] They're giving away an MI553.
[3549.46 → 3553.64] So this guy's higher performance, a Core i5 7300HQ quad-core.
[3554.04 → 3555.80] It's got, it's ready for octane memory.
[3556.02 → 3561.12] It's got Thunderbolt 3, so you could even hook up an external GPU to it at some point, if the prices ever come down on those.
[3561.12 → 3567.82] And basically, this would be, like, a very portable, pretty slick, little, low-power workstation.
[3568.30 → 3573.08] And finally, they're also giving away a Box EN1070K-U.
[3573.08 → 3581.32] So this guy's available in a GTX 1060 or 1070 configuration, and has a Core i5 7500T processor.
[3581.50 → 3583.02] This is, like, a quad-core processor.
[3583.50 → 3588.94] This one, the one that we're giving away for that one, comes with the GTX 1070, but it's a bare bone.
[3589.02 → 3591.20] So you're going to need to add your own drive and RAM.
[3591.20 → 3596.84] So the giveaway will be running for two weeks from today, and the link is actually...
[3596.84 → 3602.96] I'm going to post that in the Twitch chat, and we're going to have it below the archived video on YouTube.
[3603.40 → 3604.60] So go check that out, guys.
[3604.66 → 3606.74] Go join the party.
[3608.72 → 3609.12] Boom.
[3610.76 → 3611.44] All right.
[3612.02 → 3615.80] This was a week when we actually had a lot of tech news to cover and then just didn't.
[3616.44 → 3618.20] So should we try and go through some of this stuff?
[3618.26 → 3619.00] Do you want to talk about Blizzard?
[3619.50 → 3620.46] I mean, I'm down.
[3620.46 → 3622.58] I don't actually have a ton to say, surprisingly.
[3623.20 → 3623.42] Really?
[3623.86 → 3627.44] Okay, so this was posted by Joiners on the forum, the original articles from PC Gamer.
[3627.64 → 3628.64] I can keep it kind of short.
[3628.74 → 3630.46] There are a lot of places that...
[3631.06 → 3634.22] This was trending on Twitter, which just shows how many people are actually into it.
[3634.24 → 3635.26] I think that's actually kind of cool.
[3635.80 → 3639.62] There's a huge amount of gaming news articles that all announced this at, like, the same time.
[3640.24 → 3645.02] I believe, yeah, this one actually had some details from Blizzard's vice president, which was kind of cool.
[3645.34 → 3647.00] They are bringing back classic servers.
[3647.28 → 3648.98] This is a commitment to do it.
[3648.98 → 3651.44] This is not a's coming now.
[3652.08 → 3653.72] They've asked for people to be patient.
[3653.88 → 3656.02] I'm kind of suspecting it's going to be like a year.
[3656.02 → 3657.22] It's going to take time.
[3657.52 → 3657.68] Yeah.
[3657.74 → 3666.42] Because while some of what they said about why they couldn't do it sounded like BS, there are legitimately probably some things that will have to be rebuilt.
[3666.62 → 3673.06] Well, they're hiring a staff specifically for this, which is one problem they're going to run into is trying to find people.
[3673.06 → 3677.84] And they're trying to make it so that the staff is all passionate about this project.
[3678.28 → 3678.50] Right.
[3678.56 → 3679.90] So they're trying to find very specific people.
[3680.02 → 3682.62] I'm sure there are tons of them, but they're going to have to vet them and all that kind of stuff.
[3683.36 → 3685.22] They are changing certain things.
[3686.06 → 3688.86] They're not making it so that there's cross-server.
[3689.00 → 3691.10] You will be on one server, which is very cool.
[3691.10 → 3692.82] That was one thing people were really worried about.
[3692.92 → 3693.92] There's no looking for group.
[3694.06 → 3695.48] There's no looking for raid.
[3695.74 → 3699.06] Both of those were very important to people, but they will be changing some things.
[3699.18 → 3706.02] I wouldn't be surprised if there's like achievements, and you can like to buy certain pets and like some of the...
[3706.02 → 3708.26] Some microtransaction 2017 stuff.
[3708.34 → 3708.58] Yeah.
[3708.78 → 3714.08] Maybe you can buy a certain mount that's like from the store only like they do in the modern games.
[3714.16 → 3718.02] I have no idea, but I wouldn't be surprised if there are some microtransaction-y things going on.
[3718.02 → 3720.06] But I don't think it'll be anything major.
[3720.28 → 3722.90] I really hope they don't add a character boost.
[3723.08 → 3724.06] I don't think they will.
[3724.24 → 3724.98] I think it'll be okay.
[3726.10 → 3726.92] But who knows?
[3727.04 → 3727.18] Yeah.
[3727.90 → 3728.46] No date.
[3728.62 → 3729.24] It's going to be awesome.
[3729.36 → 3730.18] I'm definitely going to be on it.
[3730.28 → 3733.04] A lot of people I know are going to be on it, which is going to be cool.
[3733.84 → 3735.64] If you want to come play with me, I'm super down.
[3735.78 → 3736.32] Let's do it up.
[3737.58 → 3738.58] That's all I really have to say.
[3739.68 → 3739.96] Cool.
[3740.34 → 3740.52] Yeah.
[3740.84 → 3742.38] I'm very happy that they actually did it.
[3742.38 → 3747.76] Let me have a look and see if...
[3747.76 → 3749.12] Actually, some of this stuff is...
[3749.12 → 3750.90] We can watch the...
[3750.90 → 3751.50] Yeah, I don't know.
[3754.34 → 3756.12] It's at the top of the thing if you want to watch it.
[3756.34 → 3757.72] I kind of wanted to talk about this.
[3757.80 → 3759.68] Posted by Aluminum Tech on the forum.
[3759.98 → 3761.42] Original article from The Verge.
[3761.42 → 3774.42] Apple fired the engineer whose daughter's hands-on video of the iPhone X went viral when she published it.
[3777.44 → 3778.90] Was it published early?
[3779.20 → 3779.52] Yeah.
[3780.24 → 3780.70] Oh.
[3781.24 → 3781.64] Yeah.
[3782.00 → 3785.30] And a lot of people are siding with the engineer here.
[3785.30 → 3793.58] Basically, what went down was she published a vlog that included a trip to the Apple campus to visit her dad and see an unreleased iPhone X.
[3794.32 → 3798.26] The video was quickly picked up by sites like 9to5Mac and spread even further on YouTube.
[3799.34 → 3807.50] So her dad basically violated a company rule by allowing her to film the unreleased handset as filming on Apple's campuses is strictly prohibited.
[3808.48 → 3813.30] The video included footage of an iPhone X with special employee-only QR codes.
[3813.30 → 3820.30] A notes' app was also shown on the iPhone X in the video, which appeared to include code names of unreleased Apple products.
[3821.26 → 3821.38] Wow.
[3821.48 → 3828.56] So a lot of people are kind of defending the engineer, and that is super dumb.
[3828.80 → 3829.08] Yeah.
[3829.26 → 3829.70] Basically.
[3830.08 → 3830.28] Yeah.
[3830.44 → 3833.30] This was literally in...
[3833.92 → 3839.30] Okay, I haven't personally read an Apple engineer employee agreement because I'm not an engineer, and I don't think...
[3839.30 → 3842.38] I'm sure this is a huge deal within it.
[3842.38 → 3843.10] But...
[3843.10 → 3844.94] Like, yeah, that's terrible.
[3845.04 → 3849.44] Take this from someone who has never worked at Apple and probably will never work at Apple.
[3849.88 → 3853.70] I know that this would get me fired from Apple.
[3853.70 → 3863.16] It is not rocket surgery to figure out how secretive Apple is and how seriously they would take something like this.
[3863.30 → 3868.30] And even if they didn't want to do it, they would have no choice.
[3868.30 → 3872.32] They are completely backed into a corner on something like this.
[3872.32 → 3881.14] If the whole thing had been quiet and the video hadn't gone viral, and they had, like, seen him doing it and been like, whoa, yo, remember you're not supposed to film here.
[3881.14 → 3887.34] That wouldn't have been fireable probably if they could have just kind of gone, okay, we all dodged a bullet there.
[3887.34 → 3894.62] But the fact that this went viral, the fact that it was his daughter, so they knew exactly who it was.
[3894.62 → 3901.26] Everyone in the company would see this and go, oh, well, if he can do it, then hashtag YOLO, who cares?
[3901.90 → 3902.70] I can do it too.
[3902.70 → 3915.16] Apple is so secretive and the development time on a project that Apple would release, whether it's an iPhone 10 or an Apple TV or who knows, maybe it's the Apple car, whatever it is.
[3915.16 → 3920.28] It could be anywhere from 6 months to 12 months to 24 months to 36 months.
[3920.46 → 3924.70] A company like that is working on tech that you won't see for years.
[3924.70 → 3936.56] And they have to take that kind of thing seriously because you look at how quickly their competitors will try to clone what they're doing with the level of secrecy that they've achieved.
[3937.04 → 3943.30] And now imagine if their competitors knew that that was the direction Apple was going, you know, a year or two years or three years in advance.
[3943.40 → 3944.58] They cannot afford that.
[3944.58 → 3951.20] That is Apple's entire value as a, you know, whatever, however many billions of dollars that they're worth.
[3951.20 → 3963.06] That's Apple's value is that they are for better, whether you agree or not, that they're innovators, that they are trendsetters, that they are forward thinkers.
[3963.32 → 3971.08] Because the iPhone itself as just a piece of cellular communications hardware is not that special.
[3971.18 → 3972.62] I think we can all agree on that.
[3974.44 → 3976.64] And they just, they had no choice.
[3976.88 → 3977.32] Sorry.
[3977.76 → 3980.32] People are saying in the chat that he didn't know.
[3980.32 → 3982.46] Unfortunately, it doesn't actually matter.
[3982.60 → 3982.94] No one cares.
[3983.20 → 3983.74] Yeah, no one cares.
[3983.74 → 3983.90] It doesn't matter.
[3984.34 → 3994.64] And like someone in the comments on the official post from, I believe it was The Verge, was saying like, oh, this might be perfect for them actually because some other company will just pick them up.
[3994.86 → 3995.52] Not necessarily.
[3996.14 → 3998.36] That's a big mark on your name in that industry.
[3998.64 → 4001.84] Like Microsoft has fired people for this before.
[4001.94 → 4003.62] Nintendo has fired people for this before.
[4003.78 → 4005.96] I believe Sony has fired people for this before.
[4005.96 → 4012.30] Probably, whether we hear about it or not, the fact that it's Apple, and it's the iPhone X is probably the only reason that we're hearing about it at all.
[4012.60 → 4015.62] Nintendo fired not only one parent, but both.
[4016.52 → 4016.80] Really?
[4017.28 → 4017.58] Yeah.
[4017.78 → 4019.94] And one of them had like super nothing to do with it.
[4020.06 → 4020.68] Well, that's stupid.
[4020.82 → 4021.52] And they're just like, nope, your family's dead.
[4021.52 → 4022.14] But that's Nintendo.
[4022.60 → 4022.86] Yeah.
[4024.14 → 4027.94] And Nintendo's also very vicious about these types of NDA things.
[4028.42 → 4029.46] And they always have been.
[4029.46 → 4035.56] In other news, Broadcom to acquire Qualcomm.
[4036.06 → 4039.44] I actually had no idea that Broadcom was that big.
[4039.60 → 4040.94] They should rename to ComCom.
[4042.34 → 4043.60] You don't like Broadway?
[4048.52 → 4049.32] Oh, my goodness.
[4049.32 → 4052.00] People apparently line up for the iPhone X.
[4052.18 → 4061.16] So while a lot of analysts were super concerned about the fact that no one seemed that amped on the iPhone 8,
[4061.52 → 4068.06] Bloomberg has this fantastic little chart in their article on this where they show lineups.
[4068.60 → 4068.92] And I don't...
[4068.92 → 4071.64] Oh, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but.
[4071.64 → 4071.98] There we go.
[4072.58 → 4073.66] Lineups for iPhones.
[4073.74 → 4075.46] I don't know how exactly they measured this.
[4075.82 → 4076.08] Yeah.
[4076.08 → 4077.94] A number of people lining up in the mornings.
[4078.46 → 4078.58] Yeah.
[4078.70 → 4079.02] What?
[4079.32 → 4079.60] Whatever.
[4079.72 → 4081.34] Anyway, it kind of makes sense.
[4081.52 → 4087.70] This kind of makes sense that Plus and C would have had big lines because all of a sudden there was a cheap iPhone,
[4087.84 → 4089.00] which was kind of neat, I guess.
[4090.08 → 4092.00] iPhone 4 was sort of a big deal.
[4092.08 → 4092.58] Yeah, it was.
[4093.24 → 4096.34] iPhone 6, 6 Plus was a huge deal.
[4097.00 → 4099.14] And then, like, nothing's really changed since then.
[4100.54 → 4101.96] And then iPhone X.
[4102.76 → 4108.70] It's showing that even though the iPhone 8 slash 8 Plus was literally the least exciting iPhone of all time,
[4108.70 → 4115.76] the iPhone X is right back up there with the 5, even if it's not up there with the 4, the 5S, 5C, and the 6 and 6 Plus.
[4115.76 → 4119.94] But then again, the 4 and the 6 and 6 Plus were freaking huge.
[4120.22 → 4120.42] Yeah.
[4120.42 → 4122.10] So there you go.
[4122.16 → 4124.20] Maybe Apple's not going out of business yet after all.
[4124.24 → 4124.50] I don't know.
[4124.50 → 4129.16] What else we got going on here?
[4130.16 → 4130.98] Razor phone.
[4131.46 → 4132.00] Let's see.
[4132.48 → 4132.86] You know what?
[4132.88 → 4133.24] I'm done.
[4133.66 → 4133.92] Okay.
[4134.02 → 4134.44] Great show.
[4134.58 → 4135.52] Great show today, everyone.
[4135.64 → 4136.42] Thank you for tuning in.
[4136.48 → 4137.38] We will see you again next week.
[4137.46 → 4139.14] Same bat time, same bat channel.
[4139.48 → 4139.72] Bye.
[4139.72 → 4139.92] Bye.
[4141.62 → 4141.94] Book.
[4143.18 → 4147.00] I feel bad for James when we only cover, like, a third of his topics.
[4147.02 → 4148.54] And this was a perfect doc, too.
[4148.70 → 4150.82] Yeah, it was actually an excellent doc.
[4150.88 → 4155.26] Of any week to not cover topics, this was the wrong one because there were actually a lot of perfect topics.
[4155.28 → 4155.70] Yeah, I know.
[4155.82 → 4158.66] I could have talked about AMD Epic getting 64 cores.
[4158.92 → 4159.18] Yep.
[4159.28 → 4160.48] I don't think we talked about it at all.
[4160.70 → 4162.82] NVIDIA's AI faces, which were, like, amazing.
[4162.94 → 4164.26] Yeah, which were, like, actually kind of cool.
[4165.94 → 4166.90] Total, Synergy.
[4166.90 → 4170.60] But, you know, if people wanted tech news, would they really tune into the land?
