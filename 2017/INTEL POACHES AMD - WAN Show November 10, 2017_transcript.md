[0.00 --> 7.58]  all right so we're late but we're only like seven minutes late dude we're relatively
[7.58 --> 14.46]  early compared to other shows yes in fact we're on time i mean even technically i think it says
[14.46 --> 20.36]  somewhere that we start at five now so we might be early it's 4 30 somewhere yeah those weird
[20.36 --> 27.52]  time zones that are seven minutes behind us yeah don't worry anyways we have a bunch of great
[27.52 --> 31.58]  topics this week we actually don't have a bunch of great topics but we have a few like absolute
[31.58 --> 37.38]  zingers over quantity this week yeah some of them are actually quite fantastic i'm going to talk about
[37.38 --> 44.24]  uh nintendo and sandisk just screwing over customers it's going to be great also facebook
[44.24 --> 52.06]  wants your nude photos today so help them out and they can have them intel and the other guys amd
[52.06 --> 57.24]  have actually collaborated to make a chip together dun dun dun and the plot thickens
[57.24 --> 65.62]  as intel gets a new employee a very special new employee it's linus that's why he's not here
[65.62 --> 72.04]  yeah he que que it anyway anyways intro to the show that's him uh that's all sailing away
[72.04 --> 77.54]  linus wait we need you i'm dead i'm james and linus
[77.54 --> 85.92]  i'm looped oops cut the bike cut it the delay box wardrobe will function
[85.92 --> 97.58]  all right fresh books savage jerky i fix it put this thing back go to no guest apparently we're clipping
[97.58 --> 102.42]  like crazy people are really upset about the audio clipity clap i don't know what people did
[102.42 --> 107.28]  we're just really loud this week we might have to redo it oh i don't know what to change on here
[107.28 --> 108.28]  can i give you a test tone
[108.28 --> 116.60]  there's a song uh i don't know how to describe it it's a russian song it was like a viral sensation
[116.60 --> 122.86]  a few years ago oh chum dum dum yeah like the guy's like super weird he makes that noise yeah so if
[122.86 --> 127.54]  on google home if you're like hey google play that russian song where the guy goes
[127.54 --> 130.38]  it'll play it it'll
[130.38 --> 135.44]  and i don't actually know the name of the song so i have to do it like that every single time
[135.44 --> 137.02]  that's amazing it works every time
[137.02 --> 144.44]  what are you doing down there luke are we gonna on the incredibly dusty mixer
[144.44 --> 150.92]  i think i might have found master volume so hopefully it's okay we're just gonna go with it
[150.92 --> 156.48]  we'll see what the audience says pc master volume race oh my goodness watch that be a thing
[156.48 --> 162.04]  someone finds like a specific volume level that like you set windows to and then they want everyone
[162.04 --> 166.12]  all the content creators to like set their volumes to another thing see i thought you were you were
[166.12 --> 170.46]  gonna go a different route like the pc master volume race is just a bunch of pc enthusiasts with great
[170.46 --> 178.86]  hair giant teased back combed hair that would be that would be absolutely fantastic you want to
[178.86 --> 183.52]  start at the beginning i want to start here yeah okay yeah uh so apparently luke has been living
[183.52 --> 189.12]  under our absolute hefty rock okay no i i knew i knew that he had left i didn't know that
[189.12 --> 195.50]  okay okay so let's start at the beginning i'm gonna leave this off screen until we get into it on monday
[195.50 --> 202.02]  yeah intel made an announcement they announced that they're gonna be making a chip that has
[202.02 --> 207.98]  amd graphics on it not integrated graphics it still has intel integrated graphics but it has
[207.98 --> 216.04]  discrete a discrete gpu that's on the same like die yeah so they found a way to create gaming laptops
[216.04 --> 220.42]  with performance level processors and discrete graphics in a much smaller form factor and they're
[220.42 --> 226.82]  partnering with amd to do it so what they've done is they reduced the usual silicon footprint by
[226.82 --> 233.96]  less than half of the standard discrete components by putting a core h series processor hbm2 memory
[233.96 --> 238.02]  and a custom to intel discrete graphics chip from amd onto a single package
[238.02 --> 245.42]  is it really bad still clippage we interrupt this program for shitty audio you don't turn down the
[245.42 --> 251.36]  master you turn on the input so where was the master i don't know what any of these are that's the
[251.36 --> 255.54]  thing i don't either i brought that slide is it so bad that i shouldn't even talk right now
[255.54 --> 259.94]  no it's not that bad okay well i'm going to continue then okay yeah go yeah you just keep going
[259.94 --> 267.40]  i wish we could can we show them a link though can you yeah there's a sweet picture uh follow the
[267.40 --> 273.04]  first link this one no not the second one okay yeah because then it'll give you a visual of how much
[273.04 --> 282.66]  smaller this new integrated thing is oh no go yeah that's it there we go there used to be a slideshow
[282.66 --> 289.34]  though on another site where you can click through and see like the normal size of the pcb where you
[289.34 --> 295.06]  when you have discrete graphics next to a processor like how much space that takes up compared to this
[295.06 --> 300.82]  one integrated thing okay it's like almost just half the size i'll try to i'll try to look around for
[300.82 --> 306.10]  that you keep going we're all stoked though because what this means is you can have a ba gaming laptop
[306.10 --> 312.34]  uh that's not thicker than the thinnest thin and light laptops we see today because you'll have so
[312.34 --> 318.10]  much more space for the oems to make up thermal solutions or maybe they can create their own new
[318.10 --> 325.68]  board layouts or increase the battery life so super super sweet yeah and that was on monday and then
[325.68 --> 333.40]  on tuesday amd had an announcement of their own yeah that raj kuduri was actually leaving so a couple
[333.40 --> 338.10]  of answers ago and that was huge and i knew about that and people have uh suspected that because a
[338.10 --> 341.62]  couple of answers ago when i was here with linus we talked about that that was the announcement that
[341.62 --> 345.76]  week that he was going on a sabbatical yeah yeah and i thought it was overhyped i thought it was like
[345.76 --> 350.34]  who cares guys he just worked really hard inventing vega and now he wants a two-month break what's the
[350.34 --> 356.22]  big deal yeah everyone's like nah this is gonna be really bad he's not coming back something's afoot
[356.22 --> 363.60]  and because sabbaticals okay to to give a little bit of inside to some of the tech industry at some
[363.60 --> 369.56]  of the really big tech companies i'm not going to name specific names very long-term sabbaticals
[369.56 --> 375.52]  are a thing and people come back so like i'm not i would have actually sided with you guys and been
[375.52 --> 379.48]  like oh it's probably fine i didn't know that but i knew in the academic world they do it all the
[379.48 --> 383.56]  time professors do it all the time it's like whatever he just busted ass like now he can chill yeah
[383.56 --> 389.44]  but uh linus was like no like this is bad and a lot of other people agreed with him so maybe i
[389.44 --> 393.48]  wasn't wrong maybe they didn't know at the time but it turns out on tuesday announced yeah rajah's
[393.48 --> 400.84]  leaving amd the next day on wednesday intel has another announcement saying uh yeah guess what we
[400.84 --> 407.42]  got a new teammate it's rajah he's gonna be the head of everything over here intel to develop
[407.42 --> 413.20]  discrete gpus hires rajah kaduri as chief architect and senior vp that is huge
[413.20 --> 417.02]  if you don't know this guy that's actually like a really big deal if you saw the memes
[417.02 --> 423.72]  from forever ago uh when he like dropped the gpu in front of linus and it was like the only one
[423.72 --> 429.04]  and it was like oh my goodness finally uh someone dropped something on camera who wasn't linus in
[429.04 --> 434.62]  front of linus it's contagious yeah it's crazy linus infected him with the dropping virus um maybe
[434.62 --> 442.28]  that's why he dropped a company oh man um yeah so he he basically started it all at radeon
[442.28 --> 448.22]  in like the 90s and then he left for a while to apple then he came back and did vega and now he's
[448.22 --> 454.70]  leaving and originally you might think okay so intel just announced this integrated card um maybe
[454.70 --> 459.02]  the next iteration of that instead of working with amd is just going to have an in-house
[459.02 --> 463.50]  discrete graphics like the similar tech because it's the same guy but no they've gone a step further
[463.50 --> 469.50]  and announced that actually they're gonna flesh out their entire gpu stack uh and most relevant to us
[469.50 --> 476.22]  and our audience is probably high-end like intel's gonna try to make gpus again that's crazy and
[476.22 --> 482.74]  hopefully they won't suck like the i740 in the 90s and larabee project that never even landed that that
[482.74 --> 487.96]  that that that is legitimately crazy i this is exciting and scary at the same time because it's
[487.96 --> 493.60]  exciting to see what intel is going to do with this but then it's also scary because like amd just lost
[493.60 --> 502.82]  the man yeah but then at the same time no offense a little bit underperforming on a couple of the
[502.82 --> 508.80]  cards compared to what people were sort of expecting so well how much of that is his fault yeah i don't
[508.80 --> 514.84]  know maybe none or maybe all i have no idea do you think they'll make a card a graphics card aimed at
[514.84 --> 519.72]  gamers or do you think they're just going to be trapped trying to capture the ai ai market which is why
[519.72 --> 525.86]  nvidia's stock has gone up three to like three yeah no i'm suspecting that direction i i honestly
[525.86 --> 531.46]  intel is not really super on top of the let's go after gamers thing um and i don't think they have
[531.46 --> 535.64]  been for a long time if if they're going to do something i expect it's going to be some form of
[535.64 --> 540.66]  enterprise application some form of industry application they've been showing that card for a
[540.66 --> 547.26]  very long time them diving super hard into uh nuk which i thought was kind of a weird move but
[547.26 --> 554.00]  whatever um them diving super hard into uh internet of things which is another thing they want to do
[554.00 --> 558.76]  with their gpus here yeah not surprised at all intel is going super hard into iot and has been for a
[558.76 --> 563.80]  while i would expect them to be trying to do something along with ai or machine learning which
[563.80 --> 569.02]  is sort of the same deal and etc i don't expect this is going to be a gamer focused thing i'm sure
[569.02 --> 573.54]  they'll find ways to like trickle down technology be like oh we figured out how to do this neat thing
[573.54 --> 577.78]  like being able to make laptops thinner because of this tech and still have it be high performance
[577.78 --> 582.78]  and whatnot which is super cool but i don't think it's going to be a gamer focused drive and what
[582.78 --> 587.88]  about the future of amd did are they screwed without this guy or did he teach a man to fish as it were
[587.88 --> 593.18]  well i think amd's been doing really great on the processor side of things and i think they've been
[593.18 --> 598.86]  flexing those muscles for a while now and when they first came out with this new wave of processors
[598.86 --> 605.74]  something that we were saying a lot was that uh they needed to be out for a while because like
[605.74 --> 611.66]  us with our infrastructure looking at the uh the editing den we don't upgrade their stuff until next
[611.66 --> 617.44]  gen yeah and we give them really baller stuff from last gen so that it's already proven we know the
[617.44 --> 623.24]  there isn't going to be any like major crazy bios changes because like the ram didn't work or any like
[623.24 --> 628.82]  junk like that it's all going to be fine a company cannot afford that downtime a gamer for a gamer it's
[628.82 --> 637.10]  like just frustrating but and sometimes even fun in a weird self-abusive way um but like it's it's
[637.10 --> 641.76]  it's a different scenario right and now that their processors have been out for a while people are
[641.76 --> 644.84]  starting to trust it more and that's really cool they've been selling really well i'm seeing a lot
[644.84 --> 651.34]  more builds starting with that platform it hasn't even taken that long no it's only been like how long
[651.34 --> 658.16]  since like four months we're looking at months yeah and already like the ram issues it's just dialed in
[658.16 --> 662.42]  oh it's tons of it is being taken care of which is awesome so they're doing great on that front
[662.42 --> 669.72]  gpus have not been seeing as much success um so i don't know hopefully teach them and fish happened
[669.72 --> 674.12]  i guess and hopefully they keep trying on gpu because i want amd winning on both fronts
[674.12 --> 679.22]  because intel needs a proper competitor and nvidia needs a proper competitor and there isn't a fourth
[679.22 --> 687.02]  so they need to kind of manage it um speaking of the tuning uh wolfenstein is vulcan only and it's
[687.02 --> 694.32]  like slaying on on ryzen it's like utilizing like for with an 1800x uses all the cores all the threads
[694.32 --> 701.56]  that's super cool tilt it's equally good uh with like a like a 7700k like those like super single
[701.56 --> 706.04]  thready ones yeah kicks out on both platforms now which is awesome that's really cool i like that kind
[706.04 --> 712.12]  of stuff when i made my wtf is going on with vulcan and dx12 video a lot of it was the reason why we
[712.12 --> 716.12]  made that video as probably a lot of you guys know was a lot of people in the comments were screaming
[716.12 --> 721.14]  about us not necessarily testing with those a lot of time and a big part of my conclusion on that
[721.14 --> 726.38]  ridiculously long video was there just isn't games that have been released that are tuned for this
[726.38 --> 733.66]  properly yet and maybe wolfenstein is like the beginning of the flock that's cool anyways moving
[733.66 --> 741.04]  forward what doesn't really matter you guys saw that but no oh my god the show is pre-prepared
[741.04 --> 748.06]  whoa so i guess that's both of those topics basically let's slam on nintendo this is ridiculous
[748.06 --> 755.08]  um well it's it's nintendo who sets this who's probably a little bit of both wow no adblock
[755.08 --> 762.62]  installed what a good person i say to myself let's take a moment to describe how the nintendo switch works
[762.62 --> 770.82]  okay so the nintendo switch has under the kickstand there's an sd card slot and it doesn't have a ton
[770.82 --> 775.92]  of storage uh the the cartridges that you have for the games you can buy physical cartridges that's
[775.92 --> 778.74]  what i've been doing for a lot of them because i've been personally worried about the storage
[778.74 --> 784.06]  and i don't want to be toting around a whole bunch of these freaking micro sd cards because i don't trust
[784.06 --> 790.48]  them really um but there's some games i do believe that's right that you have to have an sd card that's
[790.48 --> 795.96]  right nba 2k18 yeah and i think that's going to expand there's one of them um i think it's going to
[795.96 --> 800.38]  happen more and more as time goes on there's going to be games that require sd card space just like
[800.38 --> 809.12]  needing a rumble pack a little bit more imperative but yeah um oh man i actually miss rumble packs those
[809.12 --> 814.16]  were cool i like to be able to like i hate this thing because some modern games i don't like
[814.16 --> 821.44]  anyways um yeah so they have now made like it says on it nintendo switch it's an official nintendo switch
[821.44 --> 830.80]  sd card and it's ludicrously expensive this 64 gig one is 99.99 and i'm pretty darn sure that's three
[830.80 --> 837.48]  times the price yeah that's us yeah so 100 us dollars for a 64 gig card it's three times the price
[837.48 --> 843.00]  the comparable like the exact same one from sandisk with the same specs is 29
[843.00 --> 851.84]  that's really brutal uh and you can get ones that don't have the same specs for even cheaper than
[851.84 --> 858.20]  that like 20 bucks but your game's gonna load slower or whatever but yeah yeah that's that's so
[858.20 --> 865.60]  that's rough because what's essentially happening here is they're profiting off of like ignorant
[865.60 --> 871.24]  people yeah and like unfortunately a lot of it's gonna be like your mom buying you christmas presents
[871.24 --> 877.92]  yeah and she wants to get you like the switch odyssey and this and she's like oh my goodness
[877.92 --> 882.22]  this is way too much money i can't do this because where do you think in the store this is gonna be
[882.22 --> 887.08]  on the shelf right next to it's gonna be the only one that's right beside the switch stuff right and a
[887.08 --> 892.54]  lot of places like like uh what's america gamestop we have eb games whatever i think it's gamestop
[892.54 --> 897.66]  though um there probably won't be another sd card yeah could be true the other thing that's really
[897.66 --> 903.28]  insidious about this is like they're using an open standard it's not like a ps vita that had
[903.28 --> 911.06]  like a proprietary type of right storage card yeah this is it's open it's a regular sd card so when
[911.06 --> 916.02]  they designed the plot the switch they went with an open standard like like awesome which is cool i do
[916.02 --> 920.86]  definitely and then it's like they got an email one day or like a call for some like greasy sales guy
[920.86 --> 932.80]  was like got an idea for what if we just put link and mario on the box and just squeeze a few extra
[932.80 --> 938.56]  bucks out of those suckers who don't know that you can just use any old sd card yeah mom won't know
[938.56 --> 945.64]  what hit her uh i like okay so it's it's it's dirty that they're doing that it's dirty that they're
[945.64 --> 950.98]  charging so much more for it just to have the nintendo switch logo on it um but at the same
[950.98 --> 954.92]  time i guess i would still give them props for at least using an open standard because there isn't
[954.92 --> 960.98]  that many console type things or even portable type things that use open standards yeah that's sweet
[960.98 --> 966.74]  so like try to help inform other people that you don't have to buy this so why do they do it then
[966.74 --> 975.20]  yeah i why well official nintendo switch licensed product things are are like everywhere they have
[975.20 --> 978.74]  carrying cases they have like a little backpack thing that you can have they have tons of different
[978.74 --> 983.34]  stuff and you throw on the official nintendo like licensed by nintendo kind of deal except it's not
[983.34 --> 989.18]  licensed by nintendo it's just the logo um so it'll be made by someone else and then it tax on a huge
[989.18 --> 993.50]  price because you have to give nintendo money for everything that you sell sure because you sold
[993.50 --> 999.02]  whatever but then i think so sandisk is probably doing that type of partnership hey can we put your
[999.02 --> 1003.58]  logo on it yeah we'll pay you per item okay cool and then marking up on top of that they must make
[1003.58 --> 1007.90]  money on top of that so they're gonna have thicker margins on this than they do on their regular
[1007.90 --> 1014.62]  non-branded one certainly so the question is how much of that 99 is the nintendo license fee i have no
[1014.62 --> 1022.30]  clue you know probably a lot though come on apparently the 128 gigabyte version is 100 so you could get
[1022.30 --> 1029.42]  twice the capacity for the same price yeah at the 64 gigabyte range um the price difference between
[1029.42 --> 1034.74]  the two is a factor of three but going up to higher capacities that it drops down to a factor of two
[1034.74 --> 1041.24]  which would uh which is in line with our theory here that there's a fixed cost uh that doesn't scale up
[1041.24 --> 1046.82]  right that licensing cost is fixed so i choice in the chat is all pissed off because we're saying it's
[1046.82 --> 1053.52]  open so yeah there's patents and all this kind of stuff in the sd space what we meant by open and i
[1053.52 --> 1057.94]  understand why you're upset but like come on dude is that you can use a bunch of different things what
[1057.94 --> 1063.24]  we're talking about is it's not like the like playing with playstation the old like playstation
[1063.24 --> 1067.90]  one memory card deal like you couldn't use a a thing that you could just buy from a bunch of
[1067.90 --> 1073.70]  different brands there's no competition it was all proprietary from that specific company that still
[1073.70 --> 1077.64]  counts as an open standard just even though it was developed by like a consortium of different
[1077.64 --> 1083.14]  companies i think there's royalties they have to pay for
[1083.14 --> 1092.40]  i think our licenses are imposed for manufacturer and sale of memory cards and host adapters
[1092.40 --> 1097.28]  us one thousand dollars per year plus membership at us fifteen hundred dollars a year i don't know
[1097.28 --> 1103.26]  it's it's it feels open for the consumers because if i already owned a micro sd card i just put it in
[1103.26 --> 1107.90]  there i don't have to have one from nintendo do you think nintendo knew that this was or do you
[1107.90 --> 1111.74]  think that i'm sure you think nintendo's reading this and they're like oh no you guys you weren't
[1111.74 --> 1117.94]  supposed to do that no oh i i doubt that yeah i i honestly don't think nintendo cares at all
[1117.94 --> 1123.20]  um they put their logo on it they probably knew the price it was going to be i don't think it matters
[1123.20 --> 1130.56]  to them i'm i am very happy that they're using micro sd and usbc for everything that has actually
[1130.56 --> 1139.18]  been awesome when i first bought it i only i had my pixel xl pixel one xl whatever um and then this
[1139.18 --> 1144.42]  so i bought like some multi packs off amazon usbc and it was just like basically everything i had is
[1144.42 --> 1151.92]  now usbc it's fantastic i love it it's great you know what's really dumb pixel google pixel usbc
[1151.92 --> 1162.40]  really and yeah so stupid and they come in like such similar boxes and then now we have these here
[1162.40 --> 1172.80]  ah okay now we have the google pixel buds usbc yeah why why is there one i mean that's cool
[1172.80 --> 1178.22]  no this is sweet no yeah they should just all be c why is there one product that doesn't like i could
[1178.22 --> 1185.44]  have just one cord like for all of them i'm i'm assuming that i did i don't know and i don't
[1185.44 --> 1190.24]  think this is great but i'm assuming the thought process was that you're not plugging in and
[1190.24 --> 1194.58]  unplugging that true so you only plug it in once so it's annoying one time and then you leave it there
[1194.58 --> 1198.86]  and it's cheaper yeah i'm not they don't want me to and i'm not going to unplug my home just to charge
[1198.86 --> 1203.90]  my headphones yeah like yeah oh so you're saying it's cheaper it's cheaper to implement so yeah
[1203.90 --> 1208.76]  they can throw it in cheaper cable it's cheaper to implement they're like you just plug it in once
[1208.76 --> 1214.90]  you leave it there don't touch it i would rather that everything move to c but right now it is more
[1214.90 --> 1219.30]  expensive to throw i don't like it luke i agree but i like these these are sweet have you seen
[1219.30 --> 1224.14]  talk about those no i haven't i haven't seen them at all yet so i was researching these uh butt ton
[1224.14 --> 1230.08]  yesterday in anticipation of their delivery today um and the angle i'm looking at them is these versus
[1230.08 --> 1236.22]  airpods okay which that's fair ed has a pair over there so does nick light oh yeah yeah that's right
[1236.22 --> 1243.42]  and linus has he took them with him though probably but yeah this is a larger case than the airpod case
[1243.42 --> 1248.14]  but uh it's still smaller than i thought it was gonna be and it's felt which is cool and it's a
[1248.14 --> 1254.42]  little magnetic uh kind of opening case okay it sounds nice yes it's cool uh i don't want to give
[1254.42 --> 1259.06]  the whole review right away right now but uh i think they look pretty cool they do look pretty cool
[1259.06 --> 1264.94]  i've been interested in these like like again bluetooth earbud kind of dealies but i'm not gonna
[1264.94 --> 1270.34]  lie i've been looking at the apple ones more my reasoning for that and i'm really interested in
[1270.34 --> 1276.64]  seeing the review on this actually that's kind of a cool charging mechanism he's crossing over it is
[1276.64 --> 1286.06]  pretty cool oh and they go in magnetic yeah release pretty nice release your hate okay so what i do like
[1286.06 --> 1292.08]  about that what i do like about the airpods is that their name yeah is that they drop down okay because
[1292.08 --> 1297.60]  i have an issue with earbuds just coming out of my ears ah so i have traditionally had to use the old
[1297.60 --> 1303.36]  style of going everywhere i thought you were gonna say you didn't like the ones that went up and behind
[1303.36 --> 1309.24]  oh no i'm cool with those okay yeah it just is that what do these no okay no they have a cord
[1309.24 --> 1314.00]  they're neck buds i just learned that word i didn't that's a phrase all right yeah people call them
[1314.00 --> 1318.92]  neck buds cool like because there's truly wireless like the airpods and like the braggy dash or whatever
[1318.92 --> 1325.50]  um but the ones that are connected like jaybird runs neck pods neck buds neck buds yeah okay
[1325.50 --> 1332.82]  neato more on those uh next week yeah i'm gonna do a little segue do floatplane stuff
[1332.82 --> 1337.90]  oh my goodness floatplane speaking of seeing these next week they'll be on floatplane first
[1337.90 --> 1344.56]  yeah they will floatplane on tech cookie right now how to set up intel optane cache i'm gonna tell
[1344.56 --> 1348.52]  you right now that is a difficult process i legitimately think this video is gonna be awesome
[1348.52 --> 1354.20]  i don't think you're uh gonna be sitting there struggling how to install one right now and need
[1354.20 --> 1358.72]  that video so this might not necessarily immediately be a reason to buy floatplane because of utilitarian
[1358.72 --> 1362.18]  aspect but it's interesting and you might have to set one up in the future but
[1362.18 --> 1366.92]  put that in your pocket bookmark it yeah exactly that's evergreen heck yeah uh we built a freaking
[1366.92 --> 1372.12]  laser cutter is performing super well right now tons of people watching that very interesting video
[1372.12 --> 1376.42]  uh we put in a door that i can't show you it's right here i can't show you just because i can't
[1376.42 --> 1381.28]  turn the camera it's right there it's it's a door it's it's way more interesting there's some people
[1381.28 --> 1385.28]  in the comments that are like people are getting way too worked up about this door it's a big deal
[1385.28 --> 1390.34]  there's a whole nother like essentially building there we had no internal access to it before it's
[1390.34 --> 1395.08]  very cool there's a door here it is actually not for much longer yeah we're gonna be doing some
[1395.08 --> 1401.40]  more work on that and there's video about that we have insane ssd raid setup that is bootable
[1401.40 --> 1408.74]  using samsung 960 pros uh iphone 8 versus go pro hero 6 black is that on youtube yet
[1408.74 --> 1415.72]  tomorrow tomorrow okay yeah so we're yeah so rush out get floatplane tonight do it can't watch that
[1415.72 --> 1419.52]  thing it's actually an interesting video because gopro has been in an interesting spot for a while
[1419.52 --> 1424.48]  because phone cameras are getting a lot better i did watch it it's good i assumed it was yours because
[1424.48 --> 1428.70]  you're in a fair amount of the b-roll stuff that happens yeah yeah that's a way to figure out who
[1428.70 --> 1437.96]  wrote the video by the way kind of a little cheeky trick ah that gopro though ah yeah can't give the
[1437.96 --> 1446.96]  video away it's interesting though um it's it's not even fair though because it's fall slash winter here
[1446.96 --> 1453.98]  and we're not snowboarding like just i would love to take it out surfing in hawaii to just so our b-roll
[1453.98 --> 1458.54]  was as nice as some of the footage that's on their website instead of being like yeah here's a
[1458.54 --> 1464.18]  kind of rainy uh field by our work yeah because like if you can just hold it there with your hand
[1464.18 --> 1468.40]  like this of course the phone's gonna do pretty well but and i know this was mentioned in the video
[1468.40 --> 1472.14]  one of the ways that gopro shines is you can just like stick it to something and it'll be okay
[1472.14 --> 1478.46]  yeah which is actually super cool um but a few years ago they were actually this might even be just
[1478.46 --> 1485.26]  like a misconception in my in my mind a few years ago like gopro hero 3 era um which is when the
[1485.26 --> 1491.86]  iphone 5s was out i thought back then like gopro stomped it i remember when i first saw gopros i was
[1491.86 --> 1496.74]  like holy cow that's like the sickest footage i've ever seen so i went back and on youtube there's
[1496.74 --> 1502.72]  actually comparison videos between the three plus or three plus silver um versus the iphone 5s and
[1502.72 --> 1511.98]  they were pretty comparable all right i don't know yeah maybe maybe the idea of using your phone
[1511.98 --> 1520.24]  as a filming device is being more accepted now yeah well i remember that the first time i saw
[1520.24 --> 1525.68]  a monopod it was like at a music festival and someone put their gopro on the end of it and
[1525.68 --> 1529.36]  brought it to a music festival and i had a gopro and i thought like oh that's weird these things are
[1529.36 --> 1534.28]  action cams but now it's like trickled out to just bring it to a music festival and then after that
[1534.28 --> 1539.32]  that monopole started to be called selfie stick and people put phones on them yeah so it's like it
[1539.32 --> 1543.76]  all like conceptually like the technology is equal but conceptually it trickled down from one spot to
[1543.76 --> 1548.64]  the other somebody pointed out when show used to get 10k viewers it does get less now on twitch but
[1548.64 --> 1553.70]  it's also because we didn't announce uh this video on youtube because of some reason that i don't
[1553.70 --> 1560.02]  remember but i'm gonna i'm gonna segue from that into the random stuff that was sent to me this week
[1560.02 --> 1568.60]  so uh i was sent a five pound gummy bear it's it's uh apparently the world's largest gummy bear
[1568.60 --> 1575.02]  and it was made in the usa which is not not surprising um the version that i got is apparently sour apple
[1575.02 --> 1583.34]  and i don't think i can eat it oh uh it's it's 6 000 calories it was it was sent the the thing that
[1583.34 --> 1589.58]  hurts too is it was sent to me for my birthday which like makes me want to but then it's 6 000
[1589.58 --> 1594.22]  calories you have to have a gummy bear party man a gummy bear party you're gonna have to slice it up
[1594.22 --> 1601.18]  into cubes and have a little toothpick so this is the cake oh my candles in it just like
[1601.18 --> 1608.14]  just mutilate a gummy bear for the cake that's fantastic it's 10 inches tall it weighs it weighs
[1608.14 --> 1613.82]  approximately five pounds um yeah this is the sour apple version and like this is
[1613.82 --> 1621.24]  like do you guys see the mic stand move when i did that like you could you could hammer nails with
[1621.24 --> 1624.86]  this when you first chucked it at me i was like holy that's good yeah yeah that is girthy
[1624.86 --> 1630.06]  imagine that coming out on a on a platter and it's got one of these things and then
[1630.06 --> 1635.26]  there's like candles in the top you're serving it like a cake but not lying down like it's oh my
[1635.26 --> 1639.90]  standing and you're serving pieces like probably support its own way cutting pieces lengthwise
[1640.78 --> 1645.66]  yeah like i i've tossed this to people every time someone catches it there's like what the heck you
[1645.66 --> 1650.46]  don't expect it at first not only would it even if it was like your favorite flavor for someone to dummy
[1650.46 --> 1656.86]  that in one sitting is impossible oh for you to open it it's 6 000 calories roughly it's four it's
[1656.86 --> 1662.46]  1400 gummy bears worth of gummy bear for you to open that and not finish it in one sitting but
[1662.46 --> 1668.06]  then want to eat it again later yeah it's gonna be gnarly yeah like the part where your saliva
[1668.06 --> 1672.94]  touches it's gonna get all gross isn't it like it's nicely trapped in there in its own little air
[1672.94 --> 1678.14]  bubble but the second this like aerates properly things you get stuck to it yeah hair on it some
[1678.14 --> 1685.26]  flies and be like i found the mother load and not only that but it's sour apple yeah i feel like
[1685.26 --> 1690.54]  something that's got a bite like that i can't do that much of apparently because i'm actually kind
[1690.54 --> 1695.82]  of down with sour apple but like oh max has opened the door it is you didn't see this gun here and now
[1695.82 --> 1703.02]  you know she's seen it you need it she wants us to eat it you want to help us eat it really throw it
[1703.02 --> 1710.22]  over it it's okay no no you'll die on the laser cutter boom yeah that would that would not be good
[1710.22 --> 1715.18]  well i don't know this this legitimately would take minimum six people i think because at six
[1715.18 --> 1722.22]  people that's a thousand calories phelps eats these that's what he takes in between trial in between laps
[1722.22 --> 1729.26]  just like a pelican one one big gulp can you imagine if it was just in your stomach in one
[1729.26 --> 1733.66]  piece and then your stomach acid was just trying to erode it from the edges it takes so long you
[1733.66 --> 1738.14]  like a snake you just eat like once every six months so what's the name of the website uh where
[1738.14 --> 1743.34]  it comes from so this is from well the guy that sent it to me thank you very much this is from simless
[1743.34 --> 1751.18]  the guys that make synergy but this is www.giantgummybears.com this is not actually a spot naturally
[1751.18 --> 1757.26]  not not a sponsor you've ever heard that company big ass fans yeah they make these giant ceiling
[1757.26 --> 1762.06]  fans that are like six feet in diameter and uh i remember when i first saw one my friend was like
[1762.06 --> 1767.66]  yeah they got that from a place called big ass fans it's like you don't say i feel it's the same
[1767.66 --> 1773.58]  with this gummy bear is it a vegan gummy bear i have no idea no it's definitely not no no gelatin's
[1773.58 --> 1779.90]  made from like ground up bones or something okay wow so super not that's what i would take that as
[1779.90 --> 1784.70]  anyways thank you thank you simless i guess for that and then also someone sent me this shirt
[1785.42 --> 1790.46]  which says heck yeah and then has a big l l on it which apparently i say this a lot i didn't know
[1790.46 --> 1795.42]  that and then i said that to jake and he's like you do you say that a lot so yeah thank you that's
[1795.42 --> 1801.74]  a heckin nice shirt yeah what's the l though oh it's a it's a luke yeah ah it's even in our colors yeah
[1801.74 --> 1805.26]  which is kind of neat and there's a there's a black one too so i have both you should plot something on
[1805.26 --> 1811.34]  like it's a graph that's what i think of when i see oh my goodness yeah like the crazy yeah is the
[1811.34 --> 1812.86]  yeah is the independent variable
[1815.58 --> 1821.26]  yes absolutely as ya goes on you can see heck is fluctuating uh speaking of things that were
[1821.26 --> 1826.70]  sent to me this week facebook wants to send you nudes or wants you to send them nudes i said that
[1826.70 --> 1833.82]  the completely wrong way around but yeah apparently facebook is advertising um that they can try to help
[1833.82 --> 1840.78]  combat revenge porn which is which is good um but the way they want to do it is kind of
[1841.66 --> 1848.46]  funky um so let me get the article up here one of the things you get it yeah you get it but it's
[1848.46 --> 1857.66]  like but it's facebook so you're also like i don't know let's just get into it here so apparently the
[1857.66 --> 1863.34]  idea is that you send facebook the image and they make a let's see here where is it
[1865.58 --> 1870.30]  messenger can send the images to be hashed this means that the company converts the image into a
[1870.30 --> 1877.10]  unique digital fingerprint that can be used to identify any identify and block any attempts to
[1877.10 --> 1884.62]  re-upload the same image i guess probably only to facebook yeah apparently they will take action yeah
[1884.62 --> 1890.06]  they will take action against pictures that were posted to facebook instagram or messenger so you
[1890.06 --> 1897.82]  can't like i guess the idea is like some wonderfully nice lady sends a wonderful photo to boyfriend
[1897.82 --> 1906.38]  boyfriend is a jerk bag sends it to bro and it doesn't work on messenger even if you direct
[1906.38 --> 1912.46]  messages to someone that doesn't work that's pretty sweet so messenger facebook in total and instagram so
[1912.46 --> 1917.18]  honestly a lot of the ways that people message each other now don't they own whatsapp too yes
[1917.18 --> 1921.98]  apparently they didn't include that so it's not shown in this article anyway so the idea here the
[1921.98 --> 1927.34]  thing that i like about this is that it's preventative yeah it's not reactionary they already have tools
[1927.34 --> 1931.34]  that are reactionary yeah where you can just report things then they'll hash them and make sure it
[1931.34 --> 1934.38]  doesn't go up again but this is totally preventative you don't even have to break up with someone you
[1934.38 --> 1940.06]  can be like you know what i'm gonna send you some nudes and i'm also gonna send them with what you actually
[1940.06 --> 1945.34]  do is you send it to yourself on messenger okay and uh right now it's being tested in australia and
[1945.34 --> 1949.26]  yeah it's it's a partnership with some kind of a governmental agency and you have to fill out a form
[1949.26 --> 1955.34]  with this agency and then message yourself the picture the agency contacts facebook so then i guess
[1955.34 --> 1960.30]  facebook checks then like sees that you sent yourself a picture and then they hash it the thing that's
[1960.30 --> 1966.94]  what i wonder is like do you get analytics like can you can you try it like okay i'm gonna send somebody
[1966.94 --> 1972.38]  news and then i'm gonna send it to facebook and then i'm gonna get a notification if somebody
[1972.38 --> 1977.02]  tries to re-upload these nudes and then i'll know that son of a gun didn't keep it to himself
[1977.98 --> 1985.50]  that would be super interesting actually wow okay so apparently that's that's kind of that would make a
[1985.50 --> 1991.42]  crazy game that's a great episode of seinfeld or something or i don't know what a game well because
[1991.42 --> 1998.86]  like just the like mental gymnastics that goes around that because then like i guess now the
[1998.86 --> 2003.74]  the person receiving the nude whatever gender the person receiving the nude now has to be super
[2003.74 --> 2008.54]  careful because someone could like ruin your relationship if they got onto your computer
[2008.54 --> 2012.94]  levels levels yeah yeah if they got onto your computer or your phone or something and sent it
[2013.74 --> 2018.78]  to even just like themselves or some third party that has no idea what's going on it would never even
[2018.78 --> 2025.34]  get there ah and then the person who received the notification oh and then the original sender could
[2025.34 --> 2031.50]  be like you tried to say you tried to send it you're like he told you and you're like you don't know i'm
[2031.50 --> 2035.42]  not going to tell you and then you're and then someone's mad at someone else like i'm mad at you for
[2035.42 --> 2039.34]  telling you that telling her that i sent you this and they're like dude i didn't yeah right and it's
[2039.34 --> 2046.78]  just like this triangle and then someone at facebook's like i have brought doom to the world yeah speaking
[2046.78 --> 2052.38]  of that is even better uh there this isn't just happening algorithmically it's there's actually
[2052.38 --> 2058.06]  an employee at facebook who's receiving and looking at your nudes like the so it's kind of like wait
[2058.06 --> 2064.54]  no it's what no yeah there's an employee who does this what yes it's in the notes here
[2066.06 --> 2072.54]  so it's it's almost like a utilitarian type of thing like the needs of the many outweigh the needs
[2072.54 --> 2076.14]  of the few like it's harm reduction it's like okay what one random at facebook is going to see
[2076.14 --> 2081.66]  me naked but that's better than anyone i know uh who's not authorized to see me naked seeing me naked
[2084.06 --> 2088.54]  i'm just imagining there's someone at facebook whose job it is whose job it's been for years and
[2088.54 --> 2096.22]  years of once facebook gets that notification a community operations analyst will access the image
[2096.22 --> 2101.02]  and hash it to prevent future instances from being uploaded or shared so check this out i'm picturing
[2101.02 --> 2106.54]  there's a dude who's been working at facebook for years on like their dick pic removal algorithm
[2106.54 --> 2111.34]  and his whole job is just to like look at dick pics all day and one day they're like call call he gets
[2111.34 --> 2116.78]  called to the office like uh-huh you wanted to see me sir it's like dude you've been doing such a great
[2116.78 --> 2122.06]  job for so long we're gonna give you a little promotion here now you get to look at mostly girls
[2122.06 --> 2134.06]  like yes oh my goodness that's insane i thought it was automated no how is it not automated why is it
[2134.06 --> 2138.94]  not automated yeah i think i guess their image recognition technology isn't at the point where
[2138.94 --> 2144.78]  it can just completely validate that these pictures are inappropriate well who cares well what if i'm like
[2144.78 --> 2149.34]  oh there's a picture of me where i don't like the way i'm looking like my smile sucks so i'm just going to
[2149.34 --> 2157.74]  report it and then it would never get uploaded so okay i i think that that is better than like
[2157.74 --> 2163.90]  some random employee at facebook seeing everyone's news what if it what if it's political what if it's
[2163.90 --> 2169.98]  like there's a picture of politician like kicking a baby um political party doesn't want that to go
[2169.98 --> 2174.30]  viral so they go on facebook they upload the picture first and report it and so like no one can ever
[2174.30 --> 2185.18]  upload this picture and they hide the truth whoa man that's weird and like how do you avoid someone
[2185.18 --> 2189.18]  just putting like a weird border around it so actually they've already figured that out okay so
[2189.18 --> 2193.50]  i mentioned earlier that they had these existing tools that they were more reactionary than proactive
[2193.50 --> 2199.26]  yeah the like the seed of that tool was invented by microsoft i think they eventually gave it to other
[2199.26 --> 2205.42]  companies okay uh and in subsequent iterations they figured out that people were actually just like
[2205.42 --> 2210.54]  cropping it and adjusting it and uploading it again so the tool sophisticated enough in its current form to
[2210.54 --> 2220.62]  to recognize that and recognize that yeah crazy yeah that's wild i didn't that's weird what if you
[2221.26 --> 2226.38]  it's like you know i want to uh form a relationship with this person on facebook and just like keep sending
[2226.38 --> 2232.54]  them nudes you don't even send them to anyone else yeah oh these are just for me that would be funny
[2232.54 --> 2237.66]  if writing yourself a hey facebook person yeah just every week i hope you're enjoying this how many nudes
[2237.66 --> 2243.34]  does this person send the guy the person i faced was just like stop sending nudes to people like we're on
[2244.14 --> 2250.62]  first name basis here you want to hash this photo after hours heck yeah like he just gets in in the morning
[2250.62 --> 2261.82]  oh oh i know these nipples you again hey yeah there goes fred again you know oh well speaking about
[2261.82 --> 2269.50]  something that's been screwing with me and not in a good way assassin's creed origin drm has been brutal
[2269.50 --> 2276.38]  you've experienced this for sand oh my god i've been trying to stream it and i try to stream with h264
[2276.38 --> 2282.54]  so i'm already hammering my cpu okay and then this thing is just wrecked it and okay one cool thing we need to back up
[2283.34 --> 2290.38]  yeah okay okay okay that's fair that's fair assassin's creed origin drm it has like two or three of them or something
[2290.38 --> 2296.38]  two let's let's it has two okay so it has denuvo which is useless now yeah because it's been cracked by like everybody
[2296.38 --> 2304.38]  yeah so in the summer denuvo was it took like one to two weeks for hackers to crack it yeah uh but now it's like hours yeah so it's basically useless
[2304.38 --> 2310.86]  yeah so it's basically useless so an assassin's they don't need that they used denuvo again but they put a second layer on
[2311.42 --> 2318.30]  yeah okay called vm protect vm protect and it has been hitting people it says here tanking the game's performance by 30 to 40 percent
[2318.30 --> 2322.14]  demanding that people have more expensive cp to play the game that's not entirely fair
[2322.14 --> 2327.26]  and this is actually the point that i wanted to mean that point's not fair yeah because that is a quote
[2327.26 --> 2332.62]  no i know yeah um what the reason why i'm saying it's fair is not fair is because you can't even
[2333.10 --> 2340.14]  fully surpass it in my opinion unless you get something absolutely ludicrous so okay i have a 5960x
[2340.70 --> 2348.30]  okay and sli 1080s i have a nice way over the top system but like it shouldn't i should be able to do
[2348.30 --> 2353.98]  whatever that's my point yeah i'm way above everyone's getting screwed by it this isn't like a more slightly
[2353.98 --> 2359.74]  more expensive cpu like one step above no this is like a pretty ridiculous cpu and i'm trying to
[2359.74 --> 2366.14]  stream but that's not that huge and one cool thing that aco has is if you press f1 when you're in the
[2366.14 --> 2371.50]  game and i would recommend pressing it a second time you can bring up in-game stats and it shows like
[2371.50 --> 2378.38]  each each core up to a maximum of 12 i believe and then how each core is being used your gpu usage like
[2378.38 --> 2382.22]  all this kind of stuff in game really nice little graph thing and if it's not clear to people by this
[2382.22 --> 2390.62]  point uh what we're saying is because of all the drm your cpu tax core zero just gets crazy up to
[2390.62 --> 2400.78]  like between 60 and 90 at medium 1920 by 1200 medium oh i was getting cpu core zero peaking at 100
[2401.66 --> 2407.74]  very often and i'm running at medium 1920 by 1200 i have weird monitors don't worry about it
[2407.74 --> 2415.90]  um and i'm getting like sometimes as low as 26 fps totally if i'm in a highly detailed area with like
[2415.90 --> 2425.74]  a torch which is like pretty brutal but still 26 fps medium not 4k on that freaking on that yeah like
[2425.74 --> 2432.46]  this is nuts and like yeah i i could stream with nvec but it's not it's not as good it doesn't look as good
[2432.46 --> 2437.82]  the thing that's worst the worst part about it uh just on principle is that this is a battle between
[2437.82 --> 2443.42]  game developers and publishers on one side and then the cracking hacking computer uh committee
[2443.42 --> 2448.86]  community on the other side and the people suffering in this case are the people paying for the game
[2448.86 --> 2453.90]  yes they're collateral damage they're they're the ones who are supposed to be um you know benefiting
[2453.90 --> 2458.94]  here and they're getting the crappiest end of the stick i bought the freaking game man like i
[2458.94 --> 2465.26]  it's so brutal like for the first i think two streams that i did with this i just ran with
[2465.26 --> 2469.98]  the performance analytics which take up like a significant part of your screen fully open the
[2469.98 --> 2473.98]  entire time just so that people could even i wasn't even necessarily talking about the whole time i just
[2473.98 --> 2479.02]  wanted to show like look at what is happening to my computer because my computer was struggling
[2479.66 --> 2487.34]  like it was fighting it was hot in there yeah well like i don't i don't think we ever actually hit 60
[2487.34 --> 2493.42]  really even at medium like it got up to like 50 high 40s pretty often but what would you expect that
[2493.42 --> 2498.94]  to hit given your rig and my rig is ridiculous i should be able to hit 60 i'm not running 4k but
[2498.94 --> 2504.54]  that's my yeah even on max though even on max even on max i should be able to hit 60 because my rig is so
[2504.54 --> 2510.14]  insane some people apparently are even getting the blue screen of death after like one or two hours of
[2510.14 --> 2515.58]  play so i have not experienced that and i've played i think about 19 hours of the game so far i'm not
[2515.58 --> 2521.82]  saying it's not happening no no no no no what's your longest session though uh probably four four
[2521.82 --> 2526.22]  hours and you're streaming too like yeah that's that's pretty solid that's a lot of performance
[2526.22 --> 2530.78]  um i don't i don't think it's super common but i have had the game crash uh when i was first setting
[2530.78 --> 2535.42]  the game up and i was trying to tweak my settings because usually i just go into a game set it to max
[2535.42 --> 2540.62]  settings and then dial back and then well not even because my computer is so stupid my last computer that
[2540.62 --> 2545.50]  had was a 2600k so i made quite a big jump okay and at that point in time i would max settings then
[2545.50 --> 2551.50]  dial it back yeah for like all the games i'm playing recently it's like 1200p is not exactly a difficult
[2551.50 --> 2557.42]  resolution to run crank everything up i'll probably get about 60 everything's fine um this game no i had
[2557.42 --> 2562.62]  to dial back multiple times and in doing that the game kept crashing at one point in time it wouldn't
[2562.62 --> 2567.10]  boot again because it would load up and then just get to the main screen and then crash immediately
[2567.10 --> 2572.06]  and i don't remember what i had to do to fix that but i had to like change some file to like
[2572.06 --> 2576.70]  reset all my graphic settings then do it again it was it was quite a mess so the natural question now
[2576.70 --> 2584.86]  is why why does vm protect make this happen i think yeah okay so it's because that in an effort to
[2584.86 --> 2590.70]  protect the other software like the game from being reverse engineered and cracked it actually executes
[2590.70 --> 2596.70]  that software in this case the game on a virtual machine it executes it on this virtual machine with
[2596.70 --> 2601.50]  a non-standard architecture so that makes it hard to crack but i guess just the act of
[2601.98 --> 2607.50]  virtualizing it is just so intensive yeah that it borks your whole experience and makes the whole
[2607.50 --> 2615.26]  act of buying the game actually really annoying and like a big part of it what i've heard this i don't
[2615.26 --> 2620.22]  know is that they fight each other too denuvo and vm protect yeah i know that those two companies
[2620.22 --> 2625.34]  had some beef or like didn't get along like the software yeah like conflicts with itself and is
[2625.34 --> 2631.02]  that's causing huge amount of issues but anyways i heard you say a key word you said reverse engineer
[2631.02 --> 2641.50]  uh-oh sponsor spot oh my goodness had to throw in the segue had to do it anyways i fixed it awesome
[2641.50 --> 2646.06]  awesome sponsor of ours we've used their stuff since well before they were a sponsor of ours but now they
[2646.06 --> 2651.58]  like put cool embroidery on our things which is pretty neat um one thing that linus says all the time is
[2651.58 --> 2657.98]  that you can buy one of these things this is the pro tech tool get uh tool get the pro tech tool kit
[2657.98 --> 2663.98]  it is 59.95 uh it it is a little costly but it comes with a lot of different things including suction
[2663.98 --> 2670.06]  cups which can be helpful for taking screens off of things the 64-bit driver kit i love this driver i
[2670.06 --> 2677.58]  use it all the last one was x86 and this is way better uh that was that was fantastic i used it at twitchcon
[2677.58 --> 2683.02]  when i was building computers on stage and that was one of the uh it worked very well there yeah
[2683.02 --> 2686.54]  i'm a big fan of this this little spinner on the back yes because you can like palm it and then
[2686.54 --> 2690.22]  i'm doing it right now it's wonderful it's wonderful you guys gotta upgrade your resolution if you can't
[2690.22 --> 2696.78]  tell what's going on so satisfying sorry twitch um anyways they're they're leading the charge in
[2696.78 --> 2700.30]  electronics repair you guys have probably seen their website if you haven't check it out they have a
[2700.30 --> 2706.78]  lot of really really cool tear downs where they tear down a device and they will uh show how to do that
[2706.78 --> 2710.94]  how to put it back together give it repairability scores so you can know what you're getting into
[2710.94 --> 2714.86]  when you buy something you can know how repairable it is because once that warranty's gone man i don't
[2714.86 --> 2721.82]  know um they have over 25 000 free repair guides on ifixit.com which is awesome they have stuff in
[2721.82 --> 2728.54]  here like esd safe tweezers esd safe uh safety straps suction cups that i already mentioned a lot of
[2728.54 --> 2735.18]  different jimmy tools tons of pokies lots of these are freaking pokey they're very pokey oh wow that's
[2735.18 --> 2742.70]  pokey those are quite pokey you do some damage you could the i fix it home defense oh my goodness

[2775.58 --> 2780.78]  i take the lid and put it down onto the bottom and it actually perfectly fits right there wow it doesn't
[2780.78 --> 2785.66]  even come off that's one of your favorite things to do hey it is yeah pop it on the bottom all weekend yeah
[2785.66 --> 2791.82]  i just go home and i just do this i'm like oh oh it's a long week tgif that's what i needed
[2792.70 --> 2795.98]  also what i needed for another segue was some savage jerky
[2797.50 --> 2801.26]  you like that what's your favorite one have you had a lot of this stuff i've only had the most
[2801.26 --> 2807.18]  extreme spicy one oh just let's let's chill for a moment let's have a chill stream let's have a
[2807.18 --> 2812.54]  an audible chewing session oh my for all the headphone users what what is that called again is that a
[2812.54 --> 2820.54]  fetish oh yeah oh that's a version of health me does anyone i know who has that fetish we can't
[2820.54 --> 2825.34]  be we're friends off because how can we ever get along not not just eating like doing lots of
[2825.34 --> 2829.98]  different things it's a maybe savage jerky doesn't want this in their in their sponsor spot
[2831.74 --> 2837.90]  maybe it's the niche they have yet to penetrate this is getting bad this is getting very bad i like
[2837.90 --> 2843.42]  this jerky which is awesome yes it is they have tons of different flavors this one is teriyaki
[2843.42 --> 2846.78]  my favorite one i'm trying to get into right now but apparently i'm not savage enough i'll have to
[2846.78 --> 2853.74]  get there um you are getting there you see your your length compared to the uh logo here you're
[2853.74 --> 2858.14]  getting working on it yeah i should probably shave sometime in the next few weeks but then it's
[2858.14 --> 2863.02]  it's so i needed to shave like literally on november 1st and then everyone's like hey you're doing no
[2863.02 --> 2868.54]  shave november i'm like uh it looks like i already did no shave october so i'm a little ahead of the
[2868.54 --> 2878.30]  game amish december no shave 20 19. this stuff is very good try that that's linus's favorite one it's
[2878.30 --> 2885.34]  my favorite one oh cilantro it's really good do you okay that smells good cilantro is very polarizing
[2885.34 --> 2889.42]  yeah but it's only like five percent of the population or something that okay for whom it tastes like soap
[2889.42 --> 2893.66]  i'm not one of those people okay cool i like it me too i'm a fan of mexican food
[2896.22 --> 2903.10]  savage grunge they have 13 different savage flavors of jerky people seem to love sriracha bacon that's
[2903.10 --> 2908.38]  been really popular maple buffalo bacon probably popular in canada their traditional one is really
[2908.38 --> 2917.26]  good moho is my favorite one and linus's favorite one if you oh yeah apparently that's how you're
[2917.26 --> 2922.14]  supposed to pronounce it i said mojo for a long for the longest time what does the j stand for
[2923.82 --> 2930.62]  jalapeno i'm pretty sure it's just a word just not english oh yeah i thought it was like an acronym
[2930.62 --> 2938.06]  but the j for the acronym was mech like spanish oh so it was mojo oh jajajah hahaha like yeah yeah
[2938.06 --> 2943.10]  yeah i don't think that's it i'm pretty sure it's a word oh i think twitch chat will uh will correct us
[2943.10 --> 2949.18]  i'm mojo i'm gonna continue living in my reality because it's funnier i i got it from world of
[2949.18 --> 2955.10]  warcraft you used to be able to you used to fight the trolls and then you'd pick up i thought it was
[2955.10 --> 2960.38]  mojo and i thought it was powerful powerful mojo yeah exactly so that that threw me off but anyways
[2960.38 --> 2967.82]  it's wonderful tastes amazing and you get 10 off if you go to uh apparently the link is geni.us
[2968.46 --> 2972.94]  savage jerky on youtube there will be a link down in the description get 10 off use offer code
[2973.10 --> 2981.18]  ltt it's all good heck yeah and if you're like you did it you said it no ah i'm doing it too much
[2982.22 --> 2986.14]  if you if you are able to start a business around making shirts based on things people say you could
[2986.14 --> 2994.38]  use freshbooks to uh manage your financials for said freshbooks freshbooks heck yeah freshbooks is a
[2994.38 --> 3000.22]  super simple uh super simple to use invoicing tool that actually does a lot more to help you create and
[3000.22 --> 3005.74]  send slick looking invoices super fast which is one of the cool parts you can also use it to check
[3005.74 --> 3010.70]  if someone has seen their invoice which is good because then you can follow up and be like hey
[3010.70 --> 3017.02]  buddy why haven't you paid your invoice you looked at it yeah you've seen it and they're like oh yeah
[3017.02 --> 3022.06]  no i didn't get your email it's like actually you opened it so i don't know or you can not be
[3022.06 --> 3026.14]  passive aggressive and just use it to track your finances that would also be fantastic if you have
[3026.14 --> 3030.70]  any questions you can contact them reach out to their support staff and talk to a real person
[3030.70 --> 3036.54]  immediately no phone tree no escalations no return calls you just talk to someone right away it's
[3036.54 --> 3039.90]  awesome i would highly recommend checking out freshbooks we used it on scrapyard wars once and
[3039.90 --> 3044.30]  it honestly actually made the whole thing easier which was pretty cool visit freshbooks.com
[3044.30 --> 3049.82]  slash wan enter wan in the how did you hear about a section and you will get a free trial which is
[3049.82 --> 3055.98]  awesome free unrestricted 30-day trial here we go remember the show orange county choppers yes and that
[3055.98 --> 3061.74]  main guy had like a tattoo on his hand that said like pay me or yeah i think so the b word yeah
[3062.30 --> 3068.22]  i'm just imagining freshbooks has like a sticker like you can send to people like there's a read
[3068.22 --> 3075.66]  receipt indicating that you have seen the invoice uh uh sticker yeah yeah they love stickers now okay
[3075.66 --> 3080.54]  let's do this one this one is juicy this one's all you you seem like you've got it so it's personal
[3080.54 --> 3088.22]  for you okay so logitech oh let me let me post this in the twitch chat scandalous my boys what are
[3088.22 --> 3096.62]  you doing it's a scandal okay so oh i jumped ahead a little bit you did have this in there uh let's go
[3096.62 --> 3101.10]  here this is a bit of a little story there's a narrative arc when you do yeah elucidate here
[3101.10 --> 3108.22]  so i believe it originates from here is this the original it's most it's the most original i've seen
[3108.22 --> 3113.58]  okay yeah so it might might come from somewhere else but whatever originates from here harmony link eos
[3113.58 --> 3116.94]  or eol people are trying to figure out what's going on essentially
[3119.74 --> 3125.42]  let's go a little bit further back from what i've heard i have no actual proper source for this i read
[3125.42 --> 3131.98]  it on reddit that's a thing that you can do um apparently logitech was fire selling like selling
[3131.98 --> 3137.98]  at a very high discount harmony link devices not that long ago fast forward and people were happy
[3137.98 --> 3142.14]  about this that's fantastic fast forward 40 characters what is the harmony link harmony link
[3142.14 --> 3147.98]  is a universal remote for lots of things in your house like your tv your sound system your lights
[3147.98 --> 3153.90]  etc it's not an enterprise product i do not believe so okay i thought it was that could be wrong
[3153.90 --> 3159.18]  regardless let me look this up real quick yeah a little quick google here harmony link
[3160.70 --> 3164.86]  that would do this oh maybe it is
[3166.30 --> 3172.94]  maybe i'm wrong looks kind of busy watch cable watch apple tv dinner time that sounds like yeah yeah
[3172.94 --> 3178.86]  yeah okay so back to here give me a moment oh no that was the right page fantastic oh no it's the
[3178.86 --> 3184.22]  wrong page anyways uh that's a little bit of a spoiler so let's just jump to that anyways they
[3184.22 --> 3192.38]  decided that well hey let's let's use your thing actually the next step is is something i had no idea about
[3193.34 --> 3200.30]  logitech decided to shut down all harmony link systems because theoretically it would not renew a
[3200.30 --> 3204.54]  technology certificate license that expires in march 2018.
[3204.54 --> 3210.30]  so because reasons logitech's like we're no longer going to support not only we're not going to
[3210.30 --> 3217.66]  support we're actually going to just totally brick this product um it's not like it's that old we were
[3217.66 --> 3221.74]  just selling them to people a couple months ago because we knew this was coming and we wanted to make
[3221.74 --> 3227.10]  a bunch of money uh now we're bricking them so if you own this thing no matter when you bought it you're
[3227.10 --> 3233.50]  just pooped and you they were giving 35 discount to purchase a new harmony hub which doesn't have
[3233.50 --> 3240.14]  this issue and apparently uh it was a encryption certificate that if not renewed could leave
[3240.14 --> 3244.70]  vulnerabilities in the link system we should be a little more clear though it's like when they were
[3244.70 --> 3250.94]  bricking it um they notified people that if it was still under warranty you would be given a harmony hub
[3250.94 --> 3256.94]  but if you were out of warranty you would have to buy this this thing for a 35 i think
[3256.94 --> 3262.46]  the fire sale ones that i was reading they had a shorter warranty oh i think they were like refurb
[3262.46 --> 3267.34]  shorter warranty i don't know if that was all real though that was just reading in some comments that
[3267.34 --> 3271.90]  was not legitimate sources don't worry about that part consider all of that to be a rumor what did
[3271.90 --> 3276.06]  happen is they started bricking these things and they were giving harmony hubs to people that did have
[3276.06 --> 3283.90]  a warranty that was how that was working but i don't think it has ever happened where a large company
[3283.90 --> 3289.74]  has bricked something like this do you know i don't know of one getting a free harmony hub
[3289.74 --> 3295.42]  if you're under warranty was that a response to the outrage no that was off the bat no that was off
[3295.42 --> 3301.34]  the bat okay so what has now rage ensued yes outrage absolutely ensued this was huge on reddit one
[3301.34 --> 3308.46]  of the top posts blah blah blah blah people were super pissed off now after online outrage logitech will
[3308.46 --> 3314.30]  now replace harmony link devices for free regardless of warranty status so if you have
[3314.30 --> 3320.46]  one you're good uh striking crayon you can get a new harmony hub what if you don't have one can you uh
[3320.46 --> 3328.54]  uh i'm kind of wondering if you if you go buy like the pr is so bad at this point if you just shake
[3328.54 --> 3336.62]  the chair hey give me a hub fine take it take it go shut up this is this is rough that like they
[3336.62 --> 3340.30]  shouldn't have done it in the first place but to give them some amount of credit this is the
[3340.30 --> 3347.18]  this is what this is the right response well it's interesting because it's an expensive response
[3347.18 --> 3351.02]  and this but this response is still cheaper than them just renewing the certificate do you know how much
[3351.02 --> 3356.06]  that would cost oh yeah so we were yeah it must have been cheaper right yeah otherwise it would be
[3356.06 --> 3363.74]  like okay the certificate company there's someone just rolling yeah rolling except they didn't get
[3363.74 --> 3371.90]  the the sale i guess so i don't know that certificate money yeah so this this is interesting uh i'm very
[3371.90 --> 3377.58]  uncomfortable with the initial response because this has been a huge issue for me you mean the initial
[3377.58 --> 3383.50]  play from logitech yeah the decision to just brick because i one of the reasons why i hate devices
[3383.50 --> 3389.74]  that have to be connected to the internet is this uh the the ability for uh if someone has a gaming
[3389.74 --> 3395.98]  console for it to just be like well you can't play until you get this update yeah that's baloney yeah and
[3395.98 --> 3400.38]  what if you get that pushed before you're able to actually play or what if that's queued up like the
[3400.38 --> 3403.98]  system knows that you need an update in two weeks and then you go offline and then you can't update it
[3403.98 --> 3411.10]  anymore it's like i mean there's there are products that you know there's a risk assumed when you buy
[3411.10 --> 3415.98]  it because you know that it interacts with some kind of subscription service like this is a security
[3415.98 --> 3423.10]  camera and the footage is posted off-site and you have to pay every month for that and you you know
[3423.10 --> 3426.94]  like okay if this company goes under this camera is not going to work anymore that's a risk you're
[3426.94 --> 3432.30]  assuming when you buy it but when you're buying something when that's not explicitly stated at the at
[3432.30 --> 3437.18]  the time of purchase it's just like it's like a form of theft if they if they brick it later on
[3437.98 --> 3446.22]  yeah um so apparently yeah like this for example the nintendo miiverse closed down
[3448.22 --> 3453.34]  what is that it was like i didn't actually really use it but i had a wii u so it had it connected i
[3453.34 --> 3457.74]  think it was like a social platform within nintendo you could like draw some things you could talk to
[3457.74 --> 3461.98]  people and stuff so it's like have a hotel for your little miis that you create i honestly have no
[3461.98 --> 3466.78]  idea because i never did it you did it a lot didn't you i did i didn't i did see because i
[3466.78 --> 3471.74]  didn't even know how because i was that terrible okay because all i did was play uh mario kart i
[3471.74 --> 3476.30]  played the crap out of mario kart and the thing is i would when i would go back to like the home menu
[3476.30 --> 3479.66]  there'd be little dudes walking around on the home menu there'd be speech bubbles
[3481.26 --> 3484.70]  there'd be speech bubbles and in the speech bubbles would be like crazy drawings and all this kind of
[3484.70 --> 3489.10]  stuff so i think that was coming from the miiverse yeah so you could tell by just by the content of the
[3489.10 --> 3493.34]  speech bubbles yeah user created stuff yes it definitely was so it was coming from somewhere
[3493.34 --> 3498.22]  so i'm assuming i think it was miiverse just i don't know so what do they do to the miiverse
[3498.22 --> 3504.30]  it's gone see ya yeah why and nintendo does that though they shut down services on platforms that
[3504.30 --> 3510.30]  aren't that old like super fast interesting and it's it's i was actually i was reading two completely
[3510.30 --> 3513.10]  different threads on two completely different parts of the internet at the same time they were
[3513.10 --> 3518.46]  talking about pretty similar things because it was reading about three i guess technically
[3519.10 --> 3524.62]  breaking their devices end of life we're just not going to do this anymore see you later um
[3525.90 --> 3531.98]  world of warcraft bringing classic back and the miiverse thing being shut down and it was three
[3531.98 --> 3538.70]  different companies approaches nintendo goes like okay this service on this device is no longer being
[3538.70 --> 3542.22]  supported it's being shut down you can still use the device you can still play your games but this
[3542.22 --> 3548.14]  like social thing or this store or whatever is being shut down and then logitech goes lol your device is
[3548.14 --> 3553.74]  break and then uh blizzard now they didn't have classic wow before but that's because they
[3553.74 --> 3560.70]  progressed their game but you can still play custom games and stuff on warcraft 3. so there's some
[3560.70 --> 3565.34]  companies that are just like nope we're just gonna we made this we're gonna support it forever this is
[3565.34 --> 3570.78]  actually a good segue right now for another topic uh oh dang where did it go speaking of blizzard you look
[3570.78 --> 3576.78]  like you have something to say no you're just hanging out sounds good this one yeah okay so this is
[3576.78 --> 3583.82]  pretty neat this is this is uh i guess a similar starcraft 2 goes free to play after being out for
[3583.82 --> 3589.98]  a surprising amount of time seven years good lord yeah i thought it came out like two years ago it's
[3589.98 --> 3594.62]  still a new game it's still a new game in my books it's like oh yeah like the third expansion like just came
[3594.62 --> 3602.30]  out like the third expansion yeah but i stopped playing when heart of the storm came out it's the
[3602.30 --> 3608.06]  second expansion yeah yeah third part yeah that's a lot of expansions for a game though but it's one
[3608.06 --> 3615.26]  game do you still play starcraft 2 no i but where you quit at heart of the storm yeah that's right yeah
[3615.26 --> 3620.30]  when i read this though i was like oh we should get it though we should all get it like we should all play
[3620.30 --> 3626.38]  here i shouldn't go home this weekend land party on the casper it's i love starcraft man it's it's
[3626.38 --> 3632.86]  pretty cool blizzard will continue to make money off of starcraft 2 by selling co-op commanders
[3632.86 --> 3640.46]  additional single-player campaigns at 15 each or 40 for a bundle of three and other premium upgrades
[3640.46 --> 3645.66]  like announcer packs i know they have like a total biscuit announcer pack and some other ones uh special
[3645.66 --> 3655.26]  skins and war chests so so that's what costs money but what's free is you can download starcraft to
[3655.26 --> 3662.22]  like the original wings of liberty campaign totally for free if you in the past bought wings of liberty
[3662.22 --> 3667.50]  like me you can get heart of the swarm for free does that keep going because i have the first two and
[3667.50 --> 3672.78]  not the third one oh no i think i bought the third one never mind uh if you purchased an expansion
[3672.78 --> 3677.58]  pack previously like if you bought heart of the swarm before then you will get uh ghost skin and
[3677.58 --> 3681.74]  some other swag three new portraits okay those kind of things i don't know if they're going to give you
[3681.74 --> 3686.54]  uh don't care legacy avoid but when you i think i have legacy avoid anyways the thing is it's you're
[3686.54 --> 3692.94]  really only talking about the campaign because you get to download the single player campaign for wings
[3692.94 --> 3698.06]  of liberty but it gives you access to multiplayer and on multiplayer it's the full-on multiplayer with
[3698.06 --> 3702.06]  ranked matches and it's all the units from all the expansions but they did something kind of cool
[3702.78 --> 3707.10]  they didn't want these people who just downloaded starcraft to be able to do these ranked matches
[3707.10 --> 3711.58]  because people who are ranked can just light up these noobs all the time they wanted people to
[3711.58 --> 3717.90]  have some experience when they got to the ranked play so they make you play um not a set number of
[3717.90 --> 3724.38]  matches but you have to play against either ai or an unranked match on 10 different days like 10
[3724.38 --> 3730.46]  different wow yeah 10 separate days 10 like separate play sessions i guess and i think a lot of that will
[3730.46 --> 3737.02]  have to do with trolls as well because if you make someone like power up an account essentially for
[3737.02 --> 3744.54]  10 days that's a lot of work to troll someone ah and a lot of like because i i think it's a little
[3744.54 --> 3749.10]  bit of both there's definitely the you're protecting people from getting just stomped on that's what they
[3749.10 --> 3755.10]  stated they they had a little quote here um our way to preserve the quality and integrity of the
[3755.10 --> 3759.18]  ranked experience well i guess that could apply to both sides of the coin that's what i'm kind of
[3759.18 --> 3764.14]  saying yeah is and like that's it's a huge issue for a lot of games and it's a reason why a lot of
[3764.14 --> 3769.50]  free-to-play games have some sort of time barrier in front of being able to hit ranked play is because
[3769.50 --> 3773.66]  people that are just going to blatantly use hacks even if they just get banned immediately if they don't
[3773.66 --> 3777.58]  if they can just regen accounts all the time and they don't care then it doesn't matter and they're
[3777.58 --> 3783.58]  just going to hack and screw with people get banned in an hour even who gives it who cares um then there's just
[3783.58 --> 3790.94]  trolling the hell out of people stream sniping whatever else is going on i got i had flashbacks
[3790.94 --> 3796.38]  i saw the screenshots these colossus just ripping up yeah the marines there i was like oh dude four
[3796.38 --> 3804.46]  base carriers hit me up i got you are you protoss yeah ah protoss to the grave ah are you protoss too
[3804.46 --> 3812.78]  that deserves a nice yeah i like it toss my brother brother cold sc shout out used to cast starcraft
[3812.78 --> 3818.14]  oh for real yeah it was awesome day nine is like one of my favorite dudes i i watched wcs in korea
[3818.14 --> 3823.26]  it was amazing oh no way we have a little bit yeah we have a little bit of starcraft blood in our
[3823.26 --> 3828.94]  family oh that's sick man i used to watch husky yes husky starcraft h the husky husky
[3828.94 --> 3834.54]  h the husky husky here yeah anyways we are that that's that's that's sort of it is there anything
[3834.54 --> 3839.26]  else you want to talk about uh let's do a little bit on about twitter getting 280 for everybody yeah okay
[3839.26 --> 3846.38]  so that's actually been really cool you really i don't like it why because the requirement for you
[3846.38 --> 3852.86]  to essentialize and boil down your point into this little art form of 140 characters was the only
[3852.86 --> 3859.98]  differentiator between twitter and facebook now it's just rants it's just gonna you can just make a giant
[3859.98 --> 3865.26]  rant and wall attacks i mean it's still limited it's still 280 it's not huge but like i liked i liked
[3865.26 --> 3869.42]  writing something out and being like huh okay how can i shave 20 characters off this and and getting
[3869.42 --> 3875.10]  it down to just this little snap that was awesome i don't really know why people wanted it to be bigger
[3876.46 --> 3885.98]  i would have really appreciated even okay so what i really wanted was for tags to not count ah
[3885.98 --> 3895.58]  that's one thing that really bugged me and a link like one link yeah one url link shouldn't count
[3895.58 --> 3899.26]  that's true and like those two things would just destroy my character counts all the time
[3899.90 --> 3904.30]  and like you get into conversations where more people keep on joining and then you want to reply
[3904.30 --> 3909.90]  and your reply button it's like 40 characters left it's like yeah just because i want to continue the
[3909.90 --> 3914.62]  conversation i only get 40 characters like that that started getting ridiculous and then they said they
[3914.62 --> 3920.78]  were going to fix that well this is a fix to that in a way yeah it is sort of um and not just that
[3920.78 --> 3926.62]  and then even with those fixes i would have liked even like 10 or 20 characters more i hear where you're
[3926.62 --> 3932.38]  coming from 280 is kind of a lot i actually went to go tweet out a thing someone asked me a question
[3932.38 --> 3936.46]  and i wanted to sort of rant it a little bit so i decided to fill out the character thing without
[3936.46 --> 3941.90]  realizing that we now had 280 and i was like i'm gonna rant these points then i'm like oh wow i have
[3941.90 --> 3948.06]  half of this left i wanted this to be punchy but full yeah now punchy but full is like huge yeah
[3948.06 --> 3952.30]  it's and it changes some of the mentality because you're like okay that's half of what this guy had
[3952.30 --> 3957.26]  to respond he that isn't the most packed he could have made that message because he had twice the
[3957.26 --> 3961.34]  capacity left yeah it like dilutes the whole platform because before it's just everybody's just like
[3961.34 --> 3965.98]  snappy now i'm getting a little bit more on your side i'm not like i'm not my best self on twitter now
[3965.98 --> 3971.50]  i can just be like see you on twitter but before i had to like
[3973.66 --> 3979.10]  you know the point's been made we know yeah you get it anyways we'll see you guys later thanks for
[3979.10 --> 3986.62]  tuning into the wan show uh it links in the description uh everything's cool uh tune in next week uh oh oh
