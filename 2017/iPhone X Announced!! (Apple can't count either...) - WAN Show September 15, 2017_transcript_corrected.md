[0.00 → 6.60] And we're live welcome to the WAN show your weekly
[7.88 → 9.68] analysis and
[9.68 → 11.88] News, and who am I kidding?
[12.24 → 15.56] We just goof around on Friday afternoons and
[16.08 → 20.68] For some reason you guys like to watch because you're weird like that. I
[21.42 → 24.28] Like to watch. Yeah, who doesn't?
[25.28 → 28.82] So doing we've got a lot of great topics for you guys today
[28.82 → 31.72] But rather than tell you about them
[31.72 → 37.20] I'm going to pick all the most boring ones so that I can razz James about it in
[37.74 → 39.74] Person I don't make the news man
[41.20 → 43.20] Okay, this headline
[43.50 → 48.76] Weird case from Kickstarter that Linus likes okay first and foremost
[49.74 → 52.02] Just because I like something that doesn't make it weird
[53.14 → 58.62] This is my opinion. I like to watch for example. You like to watch too. Is it weird that if we both like it?
[58.82 → 63.16] Well, no, I don't like this case. That's why it's weird. It's weird that you like it
[64.72 → 69.50] I didn't I didn't get it. Maybe you can walk us through you can show everyone the case you can tell us why all right
[69.50 → 72.40] I don't think it's that weird. I think some of you guys okay
[72.40 → 75.54] I don't think all you guys are going to want to pay for it because
[76.06 → 79.90] That's a whole other matter, but I do think you guys will think it's pretty cool
[80.44 → 85.20] What else we've got have we got for boring news this week scroll to the bottom usually put the boring stuff on the bottom?
[85.20 → 89.54] I don't know. This is pretty boring Bluetooth hacked again. It's scary
[89.98 → 90.90] It's scary
[90.90 → 96.74] But in like a boring way like Bluetooth has to be the most mundane boring thing on the face of the earth
[97.38 → 102.92] The boringness to cool name ratio is high though. Okay. This is a pretty good name. Oh
[103.72 → 107.44] Facebook to open a new AI lab and don't chill oh
[107.44 → 110.82] Oh, you like the Canadian stuff oh
[111.90 → 118.10] Man, oh Google Chrome lets you mute site. Okay. That's pretty cool. Okay. That that's pretty cool
[118.10 → 123.24] That one's at the very bottom. You don't even know what good news is that's for last best friend
[123.24 → 126.30] That's not what you said prove it. This is live baby
[129.90 → 133.02] All right fine you pick two cool ones
[133.02 → 139.40] Okay, this is probably one that you normally wouldn't even read, but it's possible that in the near future
[139.40 → 143.12] You might be able to charge your electric car in five minutes. I
[144.04 → 148.88] Can charge my electric car in five minutes now you have one nice the little one like this
[150.52 → 156.80] What else you got hit me again that was terrible there's going to be a new GTX 1070 okay, you know what I think
[156.80 → 163.96] My attempts to read boring news are still more interesting than your attempts to read what you think is the best news
[164.16 → 168.04] This is where we have a disconnect James every week Linus puts in
[168.64 → 173.36] To the document before I get to it his picks of things that pop up out to him during the week
[173.36 → 178.04] They pop out he puts them to make sure they're in the show the top one this week the fact that the
[178.72 → 183.52] That the video card guy left AMD that is sort of a big deal
[183.52 → 189.78] He just went he's taking one quarter off. He's taking a long Christmas break. Yeah, back in January
[189.78 → 193.00] He's going to be out for three months. Okay. Okay. This is so over
[193.00 → 198.60] Let me put let me put it this way. You know what fine. We'll come back to this after the break first the intro
[199.86 → 201.28] Yes
[201.28 → 203.12] Answer that question is yes
[203.12 → 207.90] No, there's music right now. No, they can hear us still they can, it's just annoying
[207.90 → 215.68] Don't do that you're too new to the show to be annoying see Luke gets away with it
[215.68 → 217.68] I
[218.62 → 220.62] Like to test the boundaries
[221.54 → 223.54] Do you like to watch other people test their boundaries?
[224.44 → 229.52] Mmm. Are we allowed to talk about stuff like this while we put the sponsor logos on the screen?
[230.50 → 231.78] synergy
[231.78 → 233.78] All right
[233.78 → 235.22] Okay
[235.22 → 239.68] You pick no we're going we're going right into the radio and technologies group thing
[240.10 → 244.64] Okay, so I'm going to open up with I completely disagree with you
[244.64 → 247.40] And then I'm going to let you go ahead and make your argument actually no
[247.40 → 252.18] I'm going to open up with what the actual news is so the original article here was
[253.38 → 255.06] actually from
[255.06 → 260.20] Yong Kang posted it on the forum here. We'll go ahead and pull that up and
[260.20 → 262.92] And basically just said well, that's odd
[263.52 → 267.52] Roger so you might remember him as the tiger in Aladdin the
[268.10 → 269.82] No
[269.82 → 276.44] You might remember him as the gentleman who dropped the rx480 back when it launched that wasn't me
[276.44 → 280.56] I was just present he was the one who dropped it. That's where you caught it from um
[281.64 → 284.22] And he came back to AMD
[284.22 → 288.62] Right around the time that they launched their Hawaii GPUs
[288.62 → 292.12] so that was the 290x and the 290 and
[293.10 → 296.08] Vega has basically been his baby
[296.78 → 298.78] since then and
[299.38 → 301.60] He is going on a break
[302.38 → 306.14] Until the end of q4 so the start of 2018
[306.14 → 313.00] And dr. Lisa sue CEO of AMD so she's so he's been running
[313.54 → 318.26] Radeon technologies group, which was split off from AMD proper so they're going okay. This is CPU side
[318.36 → 324.18] This is the GPU side in an attempt to make it easier for the CPU side of things to work with folks like
[324.84 → 328.42] Nvidia and the GPU side of things to work with folks like
[328.98 → 332.86] Intel okay, I'm starting to get this so dr. Sue is
[332.86 → 336.80] Is basically stepping in as now?
[337.38 → 342.96] The boss and I don't I'll just say boss because I don't technically she was already the CEO of it
[342.96 → 346.90] So you can't get more boss than that, but she'll be more directly overseeing
[347.38 → 349.38] Radeon technologies group
[349.74 → 354.36] Blurring the line between these two companies in my mind anyway in a way and
[355.10 → 357.10] also um
[357.10 → 359.72] What's it called when you go like this?
[359.72 → 365.80] Yes, telegraphing sort of an uh telegraphing an attack, you know, oh god
[365.80 → 371.92] Yeah, so telegraphing sort of an um in my mind potential
[372.76 → 374.08] shift in at least her
[375.12 → 376.62] thoughts for how
[377.90 → 378.90] Important
[378.90 → 385.12] Raja is to RTG see I think you're reaching there okay, all right make your argument
[385.12 → 388.88] So he doesn't let me stop you from making your argument
[389.72 → 391.36] But uh, yeah, okay
[391.94 → 399.00] All right, so he worked really hard during bag up needless to say the guy was probably burning the midnight oil for months literally a couple of years
[399.98 → 405.12] So he sent an internal email to the staff. Yeah, thanking everyone for their hard work
[405.12 → 407.12] Um
[407.12 → 413.74] Highlighting how kick-ass the launch has been for epic and well not epic but thread ripper and dozen and all of it
[414.82 → 417.12] and Vega since that's his baby, so
[417.68 → 420.64] He thanked everyone for their hard work and then said quote
[421.00 → 425.44] Vega was personally hard on me as well, and I used up a lot of family credits during this journey
[425.44 → 430.16] I decided to take a time off now. They can see it. They can see I'm sharing them
[430.16 → 432.64] But they like when I read stuff so it was tough on him
[433.76 → 437.92] He's taking some time off. I don't think that's hard to understand so he asked
[438.56 → 439.52] Sue
[439.52 → 442.32] When he should take it when he should take time off, and she suggested
[443.12 → 449.68] This last quarter. I think he originally wanted to go off like in January, but there's more product launches than so they chose now
[449.84 → 454.00] So I think your theory about how her influence or presence is going to muddy the water
[454.64 → 458.96] I don't think that really applies because I think it's a quiet time. She's not going to have to make that many big decisions
[458.96 → 460.56] I don't think okay
[460.56 → 466.24] It's coasting. I don't think there's ever a quiet time in the tech industry for one thing
[466.64 → 468.64] And here's my counterargument to that
[470.24 → 471.60] If I told you
[472.40 → 474.40] That it was in any way
[474.64 → 476.64] acceptable
[476.64 → 479.52] For you to be off work for three months
[480.40 → 481.36] um
[481.36 → 483.20] Unless there was
[483.20 → 484.32] I mean
[484.32 → 487.52] And here's the thing you know, we don't know about his health
[487.52 → 489.76] or his family's health
[489.76 → 493.36] Or you know, there may be personal factors at play
[494.16 → 498.96] So that may be part of why people are reading too much into this because they don't have all the information
[499.44 → 500.96] But all I can go based on
[501.52 → 503.52] Is what I see in front of me
[503.52 → 505.28] And what I see in front of me is
[505.84 → 511.12] If I told you jams that barring any kind of health issues or any kind of family emergency
[511.68 → 513.12] Or the birth of a child
[513.84 → 517.28] It was cool for you to just not be at work for a few months
[518.08 → 519.28] How essential
[520.08 → 522.72] Would you feel and how essential
[523.44 → 526.08] would I have to feel like you are to just be like
[527.20 → 528.96] Yeah, that's cool. You know, actually
[528.96 → 530.40] You know, it'd be great
[530.40 → 534.40] Is if maybe for the next few months maybe we just didn't pay you, and you just didn't come to work
[535.28 → 537.44] And then maybe after that you'll come back
[537.92 → 538.16] And
[539.20 → 540.00] You know
[540.00 → 540.72] Like to me
[541.44 → 543.84] This feels more like a slow
[543.84 → 544.32] Like a
[544.32 → 544.64] Like a
[544.64 → 545.28] Like a
[545.28 → 545.84] A way to
[546.80 → 548.64] To quietly phase out
[549.44 → 551.60] Then it feels like a sabbatical
[551.60 → 554.16] I could be totally wrong
[554.88 → 557.12] I could be so far off the mark
[557.92 → 559.28] That it's not even funny
[560.24 → 563.28] Because a lot of what's in here on the face of it
[563.92 → 565.20] Looks fairly credible
[565.20 → 569.36] Um, you know, he's been working real hard
[569.36 → 571.68] And his family probably wants to see him
[572.16 → 576.40] And this has been a very long couple to few years of his life
[577.76 → 578.00] But
[578.00 → 580.88] So why no successor then?
[583.04 → 584.56] Because I don't think
[585.60 → 588.24] Raja is that simple
[589.28 → 591.44] To introduce a successor to
[592.00 → 595.76] And I think this few months gives them time to find somebody
[597.44 → 597.76] Okay
[598.64 → 601.84] That's my tinfoil hat conspiracy theory
[601.84 → 605.76] And I would be singing a totally different song right now
[605.76 → 609.52] If Vega had absolutely kicked ass
[613.28 → 614.48] Is that Bixby talking to me?
[616.00 → 616.40] Ah
[616.40 → 618.08] No, not Bixby might have been Siri
[618.08 → 619.12] Maybe it's Bixby, but it's for me
[619.12 → 620.64] Might have been Siri activating
[622.32 → 623.28] Maybe they're talking to each other
[623.28 → 623.84] It was neither
[623.84 → 624.16] Yeah
[625.36 → 626.80] That would be a great video
[627.36 → 628.48] Bixby would be all eloquent
[628.48 → 629.36] And Siri would just be like
[630.80 → 631.60] Oh wow
[631.60 → 633.60] That would be an amazing video
[633.60 → 636.00] Like getting them going
[636.00 → 637.44] Like seeing if they could start
[638.00 → 639.04] Activating each other
[639.04 → 639.36] Like
[639.36 → 639.68] Like that
[639.68 → 640.72] I'm sorry I don't understand
[640.72 → 641.76] Could you repeat that?
[641.76 → 642.00] Like
[642.64 → 643.68] Like that prank call
[643.68 → 646.40] When you get one erotic hotline to talk to the other erotic hotline
[646.96 → 648.56] And then it takes them like 10 minutes to figure out
[648.56 → 649.60] Like no you called me
[650.80 → 651.20] You never
[651.76 → 653.04] No I've never heard of that
[654.00 → 655.52] That sounds great though
[655.52 → 657.52] If for someone who likes to watch
[657.52 → 658.88] I assume you like to listen
[658.88 → 659.84] You should look it up
[662.16 → 663.28] Pizza man versus pizza man
[663.28 → 664.00] That kind of thing
[664.00 → 665.20] That does sound pretty good
[665.92 → 666.24] Um
[666.88 → 667.28] Okay
[667.28 → 667.92] So then
[670.32 → 671.20] Tin foil hat
[671.20 → 673.68] How many tin foil hats at a tent am I wearing right now?
[673.68 → 674.64] Are we doing a straw poll?
[674.64 → 675.20] Is that what you're saying?
[675.20 → 675.44] No
[675.44 → 676.56] No I want to hear from you
[676.56 → 677.84] I actually do care what you think
[677.84 → 678.40] Uh
[680.64 → 681.44] He'll be back
[682.32 → 682.88] He'll be back
[682.88 → 685.04] I'm giving you a credible six
[685.68 → 686.80] A six?
[686.80 → 687.04] Okay
[687.84 → 688.40] Like it's not
[688.96 → 690.16] That far-fetched
[690.16 → 690.40] Okay
[690.40 → 690.96] Could be true
[690.96 → 692.72] But I'm just erring on the side of not true
[692.72 → 693.04] Okay
[693.44 → 693.84] All right
[693.84 → 694.40] All right
[694.40 → 695.68] I can accept that
[695.68 → 696.32] Because I lied
[696.32 → 697.36] I don't care what you think anyway
[698.08 → 699.12] I don't think good thoughts
[699.92 → 701.12] You only think good thoughts?
[701.12 → 701.52] No I don't
[701.52 → 702.24] I don't think good
[702.64 → 703.52] Don't think good thoughts
[704.24 → 704.72] All right
[704.72 → 706.32] Let's get into our next topic here
[706.32 → 707.68] My uh
[707.68 → 708.16] You know
[708.16 → 708.56] I got
[708.56 → 709.60] Is that really next or is this?
[709.60 → 710.64] I'm going to have to
[710.64 → 710.88] Oh
[710.88 → 712.56] Doesn't everyone want to know?
[712.56 → 713.52] All right
[713.52 → 715.60] We can talk about the iPhones
[716.72 → 717.84] iPhones
[718.80 → 719.04] Wait
[720.56 → 722.24] Is this seriously all the
[722.24 → 722.48] Okay
[722.48 → 723.60] So there are a couple issues here
[723.60 → 724.48] Number one
[724.48 → 727.60] Is I'm working on my review of the 4k blade
[727.60 → 730.56] And I'm going to screen share you guys on something that I've never seen before
[731.36 → 732.00] This is just
[733.20 → 734.56] This is just my chrome right now
[735.60 → 736.48] Um
[736.48 → 737.68] This is not very usable
[738.24 → 739.04] That's white privilege
[739.76 → 740.40] That's uh
[741.36 → 742.40] Manifested
[742.40 → 743.52] That's not
[743.52 → 744.72] This is not very helpful
[746.32 → 746.88] And it
[746.88 → 747.52] And this
[747.52 → 749.12] This is the other issue
[749.12 → 750.48] This is all the notes I get
[751.52 → 752.96] You watched the event
[752.96 → 753.44] I don't
[753.44 → 754.08] What do you
[754.08 → 754.64] You know
[754.64 → 755.28] I don't
[755.28 → 756.32] You know what you're going to say
[756.32 → 758.48] I don't memorize every stupid thing
[758.48 → 759.28] You know what you're going to say
[759.28 → 760.72] No I need a summary
[760.72 → 762.00] You have things to say
[762.00 → 763.04] You want to say them
[763.04 → 763.60] I don't remember
[763.60 → 764.80] This is new information
[764.80 → 767.36] No I don't remember how many megapixels every
[768.00 → 769.44] Camera on all the phones has
[769.44 → 770.32] All three are 12
[770.32 → 770.96] They're still 12
[770.96 → 772.00] That hasn't even changed
[772.00 → 772.80] Okay well
[772.80 → 775.12] I didn't remember that
[775.12 → 775.76] So
[775.76 → 776.56] That's why you got me
[777.36 → 777.76] Well
[777.76 → 778.40] New Luke
[778.40 → 780.56] I wasn't going to host the show with you
[780.56 → 782.24] I was going to host it with someone cool
[783.20 → 784.56] But then we ran out of time
[784.56 → 785.92] Are you saying I'm not cool
[785.92 → 786.40] I'm not
[786.40 → 786.80] No
[786.80 → 788.08] Are you implying that I'm hot
[789.04 → 789.36] What
[789.36 → 790.16] Oh
[790.16 → 792.32] You're making me very uncomfortable right now
[792.32 → 792.64] Hmm
[792.64 → 794.00] Okay
[794.00 → 794.74] Oh
[794.74 → 795.34] Okay
[795.34 → 796.32] So this is interesting
[796.32 → 798.08] Um
[798.08 → 798.54] Do you
[798.54 → 800.38] Are you familiar with this senator in particular
[800.38 → 801.28] You recognize that name
[801.28 → 801.48] Uh
[801.48 → 801.98] Al Frankel
[801.98 → 802.50] Yes
[802.50 → 804.26] He's the coolest senator I think
[804.26 → 807.10] He's the guy that rakes people over the coals
[807.10 → 808.60] Questions them
[808.60 → 809.54] Hard questions
[809.54 → 811.78] And he's got some more
[811.78 → 812.68] Oh
[812.68 → 812.96] This is
[812.96 → 814.08] This actually looks pretty good
[814.08 → 814.28] Okay
[814.28 → 815.46] So it's to do with um
[815.46 → 816.42] Their face ID
[816.42 → 817.48] But anyway
[817.48 → 817.80] Let's
[817.80 → 818.58] Let's talk about
[818.58 → 818.78] See
[818.78 → 820.08] Now I don't have a summary
[820.08 → 821.08] I don't have like a
[821.08 → 821.60] Okay
[821.60 → 822.50] Next time
[822.50 → 824.48] I do need the summary for stuff like this
[824.48 → 826.04] Just because I watched the live stream
[826.04 → 828.36] Doesn't mean I don't need the summary
[828.36 → 829.72] No
[829.72 → 830.38] I'm
[830.38 → 831.94] I'm flying blind here
[831.94 → 832.12] Okay
[832.12 → 833.42] So let's talk general impressions
[833.42 → 834.12] Um
[834.12 → 838.04] I don't know how many of you did tune into the live stream that we did during Apple's event
[838.04 → 838.34] But
[838.34 → 839.18] Ed and I
[839.18 → 840.10] Actually
[840.10 → 841.42] Streamed live
[841.42 → 842.26] The whole time
[842.26 → 843.30] To give you guys
[843.30 → 844.26] Sort of
[844.26 → 844.92] A PC
[844.92 → 845.90] Slash
[845.90 → 847.98] Apple fanboy perspective
[847.98 → 850.12] On all the news that they announced
[850.12 → 850.94] Um
[850.94 → 851.66] The watch
[851.66 → 852.38] Looks
[852.38 → 854.02] Moderately interesting
[854.02 → 859.22] They are taking another step towards the direction that I didn't really want to see
[859.22 → 860.58] Them go with the Apple Watch
[860.58 → 862.56] You mean independent cellular that kind of thing
[862.56 → 863.72] I like
[863.72 → 864.50] Okay
[864.50 → 866.74] See it's not that I don't like it
[866.74 → 868.76] It's that I think it's a lower priority
[868.76 → 869.64] Than
[869.64 → 870.38] Than
[870.38 → 872.18] Always on display
[872.18 → 872.74] Oh
[872.74 → 873.74] So
[873.74 → 876.20] Every generation
[876.20 → 878.92] They're cramming in more sensors
[878.92 → 883.62] This time they're cramming in a sim cardless sim
[883.62 → 885.56] So you can have a cellular connection
[885.56 → 888.12] Without needing to actually put a sim card in it
[888.12 → 889.18] Which is really cool
[889.18 → 890.88] And I would be floored
[890.88 → 892.46] If we don't see the same technology
[892.46 → 895.00] In every phone moving forward at some point here
[895.00 → 896.54] And the thing that's messed about that is
[896.54 → 899.26] That's two devices running off the same sim card
[899.26 → 901.04] What is
[901.04 → 901.74] That never happens
[901.74 → 903.48] Like you can make calls from the phone
[903.48 → 905.00] And then you've got your sim card
[905.00 → 905.86] No you still
[905.86 → 909.10] So it's an independent activation with the carrier
[909.10 → 911.58] So it has a sim card
[911.58 → 913.88] It's just built into the PCB
[913.88 → 916.10] But it's the same phone number
[916.10 → 917.72] Oh wait
[917.72 → 918.52] You know what I mean
[918.52 → 918.68] Okay
[918.68 → 919.08] That
[919.08 → 920.78] I hadn't thought about that
[920.78 → 922.04] That's really cool
[922.04 → 923.44] Anyway
[923.44 → 924.38] So
[924.38 → 926.16] Love the tech
[926.16 → 927.94] Love the idea
[927.94 → 929.86] Of not having to take your phone with you
[929.86 → 930.46] Or like
[930.46 → 931.88] Even take it out all day
[931.88 → 933.16] If you don't do a ton of texting
[933.16 → 933.98] If you just need to like
[933.98 → 935.02] Set yourself a reminder
[935.02 → 936.48] Take a call
[936.48 → 937.78] When people call you
[937.78 → 939.98] Actually you can place calls from it
[939.98 → 940.72] You can do a lot of stuff
[940.72 → 941.98] I just
[941.98 → 943.48] I hate
[943.48 → 945.20] That we aren't making it
[945.20 → 946.16] A watch
[946.16 → 946.96] First
[946.96 → 948.32] Before it's a computer
[948.32 → 949.08] On your wrist
[949.08 → 950.14] And I feel like
[950.14 → 951.82] Every time they have an opportunity
[951.82 → 952.42] To throw
[952.42 → 955.16] A marginally bigger battery in it
[955.16 → 956.08] Or to
[956.08 → 957.88] To not put something extra in it
[957.88 → 959.04] Throw a slightly more
[959.04 → 960.42] Power efficient processor in it
[960.42 → 962.02] And turn on
[962.02 → 963.00] Always on display
[963.00 → 963.76] They don't
[963.76 → 965.00] They just make it
[965.00 → 965.90] Why do you want that?
[965.92 → 966.68] A more advanced computer
[966.68 → 969.36] Because I don't want to have to go like this
[969.36 → 971.26] Every time I want to know the time
[971.26 → 972.60] I want to be able to like
[972.60 → 973.86] Just see what time it is
[973.86 → 974.78] You want to just look down
[974.78 → 976.46] Without even having to turn the watch
[976.46 → 976.86] Yeah I mean
[976.86 → 977.68] You wear a watch
[977.68 → 978.62] I'm wearing a watch right now
[978.62 → 978.84] Yeah
[978.84 → 979.90] People can't see it
[979.90 → 980.28] But like
[980.28 → 980.50] So
[980.50 → 981.68] Let's say I'm like
[981.68 → 982.78] This
[982.78 → 983.40] Jesus
[983.40 → 984.86] You want to
[984.86 → 985.88] Just be able to look at it
[985.88 → 987.34] You don't even want to have to tweak it
[987.34 → 987.60] No
[987.60 → 988.10] Even that
[988.10 → 989.16] Why should I have to do that?
[989.24 → 989.40] What if
[989.40 → 990.24] What's just the littlest tweak?
[990.40 → 991.00] That's stupid
[991.00 → 992.04] What if I'm
[992.04 → 992.34] Okay
[992.34 → 992.80] You know
[992.80 → 993.62] Okay here's something
[993.62 → 994.62] Yeah but the other side of that coin
[994.62 → 995.84] Is having it on all the time
[995.84 → 996.34] For no reason
[996.34 → 996.72] Stupid
[996.72 → 998.80] No it's not stupid
[998.80 → 1000.04] What if it was dimly on
[1000.04 → 1001.06] And then if you tweaked it
[1001.06 → 1002.16] It would shine bright
[1002.16 → 1002.38] Tell you what
[1002.38 → 1003.46] Let's say I didn't have a computer
[1003.46 → 1004.34] In front of me right now
[1004.34 → 1005.76] I'm sitting having a conversation
[1005.76 → 1005.78] I'm sitting having a conversation
[1005.78 → 1006.72] With someone at a table
[1006.72 → 1008.64] I want to know what time it is
[1008.64 → 1010.46] This phone
[1010.46 → 1011.96] With it's always on display
[1011.96 → 1013.96] Is a timepiece
[1013.96 → 1014.50] Right there
[1014.50 → 1016.04] Boom
[1016.04 → 1016.70] Convenient
[1016.70 → 1018.24] So convenient
[1018.24 → 1019.68] I don't have to pick it up
[1019.68 → 1020.66] And go like this
[1020.66 → 1021.88] Because really
[1021.88 → 1023.92] Here's the issue
[1023.92 → 1026.18] It does time
[1026.18 → 1027.72] Almost
[1027.72 → 1028.60] No better
[1028.60 → 1029.40] Than a phone
[1029.40 → 1030.28] Okay
[1030.28 → 1031.88] I have to do the exact same
[1031.88 → 1032.52] Stupid
[1032.52 → 1034.18] Routine
[1034.18 → 1035.62] To check the time
[1035.62 → 1036.40] On my phone
[1036.40 → 1037.68] As I do on my watch
[1037.68 → 1039.20] And they're so concerned
[1039.20 → 1040.14] About making it
[1040.14 → 1041.54] Call phones
[1041.54 → 1043.16] And browse the internet
[1043.16 → 1044.88] And track all of my
[1044.88 → 1046.62] Running and walking
[1046.62 → 1047.54] And swimming
[1047.54 → 1048.48] And jumping
[1048.48 → 1049.12] And breathing
[1049.12 → 1050.00] And heart rate
[1050.00 → 1051.02] That it
[1051.02 → 1052.34] They can't
[1052.34 → 1053.46] Like
[1053.46 → 1054.72] That's so reasonable
[1054.72 → 1055.76] For them to do that though
[1055.76 → 1057.38] Because the biggest criticism
[1057.38 → 1057.84] With a watch
[1057.84 → 1059.10] Is that it doesn't do anything
[1059.10 → 1060.82] So they want to put
[1060.82 → 1061.62] More things in it
[1061.62 → 1062.20] For it to do
[1062.20 → 1063.94] Is that even
[1063.94 → 1064.76] The biggest criticism
[1064.76 → 1065.34] Of a watch
[1065.34 → 1066.16] It is for me
[1066.16 → 1066.98] Who is
[1066.98 → 1067.46] Well yeah
[1067.46 → 1068.18] But you wear
[1068.18 → 1069.46] An analog watch
[1069.46 → 1070.12] You
[1070.12 → 1071.28] I wouldn't necessarily
[1071.28 → 1071.48] Have created
[1071.48 → 1073.16] Your own biggest complaint
[1073.16 → 1073.88] Why don't you get
[1073.88 → 1075.38] A Casio calculator watch
[1075.38 → 1075.60] Then
[1075.60 → 1076.26] If you want it
[1076.26 → 1076.86] To do something
[1076.86 → 1077.80] But it's too small
[1077.80 → 1079.38] You can take boobies on it
[1079.38 → 1080.04] And be like
[1080.04 → 1081.20] Bootless
[1081.20 → 1081.90] Noob
[1081.90 → 1084.18] You can probably
[1084.18 → 1085.26] Write noobless too
[1085.26 → 1086.74] Nah I don't think
[1086.74 → 1087.30] You can do the N
[1087.30 → 1087.78] There's no N
[1087.78 → 1088.46] Yeah no N
[1088.46 → 1088.72] Alright
[1088.72 → 1090.18] Do I know numbers
[1090.18 → 1092.00] Do I know numbers
[1092.00 → 1092.38] I'd actually
[1092.38 → 1093.12] The secret's out
[1093.12 → 1093.62] I don't even know
[1093.62 → 1094.22] How to tell time
[1094.22 → 1094.68] On this thing
[1094.68 → 1096.84] What's the secret
[1096.84 → 1097.96] Are you kidding
[1097.96 → 1098.58] With analog watches
[1098.58 → 1099.22] I don't know
[1099.22 → 1099.74] What this means
[1099.74 → 1101.24] It's two lines down
[1101.24 → 1102.74] Two lines down o'clock
[1102.74 → 1103.68] I get to go home
[1103.68 → 1108.52] Digital age
[1108.52 → 1110.34] Two lines down o'clock
[1110.34 → 1111.64] You know
[1111.64 → 1112.20] Okay
[1112.20 → 1112.82] I'll confess
[1112.82 → 1114.54] That reading analog time
[1114.54 → 1116.18] Is not my forte either
[1116.18 → 1117.60] I'm really slow at it
[1117.60 → 1118.62] Like you're counting by fives
[1118.62 → 1119.34] And you're staring at it
[1119.34 → 1120.52] I'm super slow at it
[1120.52 → 1121.16] Like I can
[1121.16 → 1122.40] Obviously I can do it
[1122.40 → 1123.76] But it takes me a minute
[1123.76 → 1124.80] It's a form of muscle memory
[1124.80 → 1125.84] It's um
[1125.84 → 1126.80] And you know what
[1126.80 → 1127.24] It's funny
[1127.24 → 1128.00] Because I think
[1128.00 → 1129.26] I'm probably not the only one
[1129.26 → 1130.66] Like you remember
[1130.66 → 1131.70] It wasn't that long ago
[1131.70 → 1132.28] Windows
[1132.28 → 1134.72] Had an analog clock
[1134.72 → 1135.40] When you clicked
[1135.40 → 1136.14] Oh that's funny
[1136.14 → 1136.84] We're in the way
[1136.84 → 1137.36] There we go
[1137.36 → 1138.80] Had an analog clock
[1138.80 → 1139.46] When you clicked
[1139.46 → 1140.54] The time
[1140.54 → 1141.48] In the bottom right corner
[1141.48 → 1142.22] No, thank you
[1142.22 → 1143.16] Whereas now
[1143.16 → 1145.60] They went digital with it
[1145.60 → 1146.18] Because I think
[1146.18 → 1146.98] This is just a
[1146.98 → 1147.66] A skill
[1147.66 → 1148.82] Like driving manual
[1148.82 → 1150.12] That's fading
[1150.12 → 1150.98] From our
[1150.98 → 1151.78] Collective
[1151.78 → 1154.36] Well it's
[1154.36 → 1156.32] You could learn
[1156.32 → 1157.02] As a toddler
[1157.02 → 1157.74] To read that
[1157.74 → 1158.56] Way earlier
[1158.56 → 1160.02] Than an analog watch
[1160.02 → 1160.88] There's no secret to it
[1160.88 → 1161.36] If you know
[1161.36 → 1161.80] What the number
[1161.80 → 1162.56] Looks like
[1162.56 → 1162.98] Then you know
[1162.98 → 1163.36] How to say
[1163.36 → 1164.04] Just say it aloud
[1164.04 → 1164.92] Yes and no
[1164.92 → 1165.18] I mean
[1165.18 → 1165.44] 532
[1165.44 → 1166.08] Okay no
[1166.08 → 1166.98] Time is a little bit
[1166.98 → 1168.10] Complicated for little kids
[1168.10 → 1169.04] As someone who has
[1169.04 → 1169.66] A little kid
[1169.66 → 1171.28] And has
[1171.28 → 1172.06] So
[1172.06 → 1172.56] Man
[1172.56 → 1173.76] Are you mansplaining me?
[1173.84 → 1175.06] I used to be a little kid
[1175.06 → 1176.44] I know how it goes
[1176.44 → 1178.40] Mansplaining
[1178.40 → 1178.68] Okay
[1178.68 → 1180.12] I'm just joking
[1180.12 → 1180.72] Go ahead please
[1180.72 → 1182.22] The word mansplaining
[1182.22 → 1183.46] Is banned
[1183.46 → 1184.40] From the WAN show
[1184.40 → 1185.40] As of this moment
[1185.40 → 1186.48] Because there are two men talking
[1186.48 → 1187.32] So it's
[1187.32 → 1189.38] No that's not why it's banned
[1189.38 → 1190.10] It's banned because
[1190.10 → 1190.78] It's ridiculous
[1190.78 → 1191.76] Um
[1191.76 → 1192.84] Okay so
[1192.84 → 1193.94] See how you explain to me
[1193.94 → 1194.76] That it's ridiculous
[1194.76 → 1196.50] Okay mansplaining
[1196.50 → 1197.40] Mansplaining is allowed
[1197.40 → 1198.40] No it's not
[1198.40 → 1199.02] I'm a man
[1199.02 → 1199.86] We're not all dads
[1199.86 → 1200.72] So
[1200.72 → 1201.78] So I was
[1201.78 → 1202.66] Going through this
[1202.66 → 1203.56] With my son
[1203.56 → 1205.36] And he goes
[1205.36 → 1206.08] Um
[1206.08 → 1207.44] I said
[1207.44 → 1208.58] Okay we've got to be
[1208.58 → 1209.00] At school
[1209.00 → 1209.64] Or somewhere
[1209.64 → 1210.36] I forget where I was
[1210.36 → 1210.74] Talking about
[1210.74 → 1211.56] But we've got to be there
[1211.56 → 1211.94] At
[1211.94 → 1213.72] At 8.50
[1213.72 → 1215.78] And he goes
[1215.78 → 1216.66] Oh okay
[1216.66 → 1218.24] So, but we have
[1218.24 → 1219.72] The half of the rest
[1219.72 → 1220.24] Of the hour
[1220.24 → 1220.92] Until nine
[1220.92 → 1221.68] Or something like that
[1221.68 → 1222.36] 10 base versus 12 base
[1222.36 → 1222.64] Yeah
[1222.64 → 1223.92] He figured we were using
[1223.92 → 1225.50] Like a base 10 system
[1225.50 → 1227.06] Uh for time
[1227.06 → 1227.64] And I kind of went
[1227.64 → 1228.44] Uh, uh
[1228.44 → 1228.84] No
[1228.84 → 1229.76] Okay actually
[1229.76 → 1230.42] Not
[1230.42 → 1230.68] So
[1230.68 → 1231.70] So there are things
[1231.70 → 1232.16] About time
[1232.16 → 1233.40] That are complicated
[1233.40 → 1234.94] Even if you're looking
[1234.94 → 1235.50] At the numbers
[1235.50 → 1235.78] But
[1235.78 → 1236.38] But we're just talking
[1236.38 → 1237.14] About the reading of it
[1237.14 → 1237.86] I feel like
[1237.86 → 1238.56] We've gotten
[1238.56 → 1239.30] Off topic
[1239.30 → 1240.04] A little bit here
[1240.04 → 1241.46] So bezel-less displays
[1241.46 → 1243.24] The Apple Watch
[1243.24 → 1244.82] We want to talk
[1244.82 → 1245.16] About the
[1245.16 → 1246.68] I'm not excited about
[1246.68 → 1248.70] Because it doesn't
[1248.70 → 1249.68] Have an always on display
[1249.68 → 1250.36] And
[1250.36 → 1252.10] Apple can sell me
[1252.10 → 1252.82] Another watch
[1252.82 → 1253.80] Like you know
[1253.80 → 1254.34] SOS
[1254.34 → 1255.42] With just your watch
[1255.42 → 1256.24] It's pretty cool
[1256.24 → 1257.30] Um
[1257.30 → 1258.32] Not needing to be able
[1258.32 → 1258.86] To get it your phone
[1258.86 → 1259.64] Or even have it with you
[1259.64 → 1260.76] All cool stuff
[1260.76 → 1261.70] But
[1261.70 → 1262.50] I'm not buying
[1262.50 → 1263.16] Another one
[1263.16 → 1263.82] Until
[1263.82 → 1264.60] They give me
[1264.60 → 1265.42] An always on display
[1265.42 → 1266.50] Okay
[1266.50 → 1267.28] Alright
[1267.28 → 1268.12] What's the next
[1268.12 → 1268.58] What's the next
[1268.58 → 1269.64] Product that they had
[1269.64 → 1270.02] Um
[1270.02 → 1270.92] What did I mean
[1270.92 → 1271.46] Did they update
[1271.46 → 1272.48] Safari or something
[1272.48 → 1273.02] Come on
[1273.02 → 1273.48] Let's just get
[1273.48 → 1274.14] To the meat and potatoes
[1274.14 → 1274.96] Um
[1274.96 → 1276.20] No, no no
[1276.20 → 1276.66] Hold on
[1276.66 → 1277.14] Uh
[1277.14 → 1277.38] What
[1277.38 → 1278.24] Oh right
[1278.24 → 1279.84] Apple's new headquarters
[1279.84 → 1282.24] The design
[1282.24 → 1283.76] The design
[1283.76 → 1284.64] Looks great
[1284.64 → 1285.54] I thought the keynote
[1285.54 → 1286.50] From the Steve Jobs
[1286.50 → 1286.78] Theatre
[1286.78 → 1287.80] Was absolutely
[1287.80 → 1288.98] Gorgeous
[1288.98 → 1289.50] Also
[1289.50 → 1291.40] Have you seen their new stores
[1291.40 → 1292.80] The town
[1292.80 → 1293.18] Centre
[1293.18 → 1294.82] Or town hall
[1294.82 → 1295.50] Or what was it
[1295.50 → 1296.10] Town
[1296.10 → 1296.62] Town centre
[1296.62 → 1296.92] Okay
[1296.92 → 1298.22] We're not
[1298.22 → 1298.72] You know what
[1298.72 → 1299.20] Forget it
[1299.20 → 1299.54] Let's
[1299.54 → 1300.38] Let's just not talk about that
[1300.38 → 1301.28] We're not going to talk about
[1301.28 → 1302.60] We're not going to talk about
[1302.60 → 1303.20] The iPhone
[1303.20 → 1303.94] At all
[1303.94 → 1304.88] Let's talk about
[1304.88 → 1305.72] The new concept
[1305.72 → 1306.78] For Apple's
[1306.78 → 1307.52] Retail store
[1307.52 → 1308.10] And sorry
[1308.10 → 1309.20] I almost called it a store
[1309.20 → 1310.36] It's not a store
[1310.36 → 1311.94] It's a town centre
[1311.94 → 1312.32] Because
[1312.32 → 1314.26] This is going to be a place
[1314.26 → 1315.84] Where people go
[1315.84 → 1317.16] To gather
[1317.16 → 1318.92] And teach each other
[1318.92 → 1319.48] And learn
[1319.48 → 1320.20] Learn from each other
[1320.20 → 1320.80] And interact
[1320.80 → 1321.50] With each other
[1321.50 → 1322.48] That's right
[1322.48 → 1323.08] Where
[1323.08 → 1323.70] Where they're
[1323.70 → 1324.96] Actually Apple
[1324.96 → 1326.48] Is bringing it full circle
[1326.48 → 1327.22] Okay
[1327.22 → 1328.30] They took us
[1328.30 → 1329.64] They took us
[1329.64 → 1330.84] From talking to each other
[1330.84 → 1331.52] Like this
[1331.52 → 1333.24] To talking to each other
[1333.24 → 1334.52] Like this
[1334.52 → 1335.68] When we're in the same room
[1335.68 → 1337.30] That's not how you use a phone
[1337.30 → 1339.40] And now they're bringing us back
[1339.40 → 1340.96] To talking like this
[1340.96 → 1341.86] About this
[1341.86 → 1342.76] Are you sure they are
[1342.76 → 1343.52] Yeah
[1343.52 → 1345.42] That's what it's all about
[1345.42 → 1346.98] It doesn't matter
[1346.98 → 1347.86] You know
[1347.86 → 1348.68] How many
[1348.68 → 1350.28] Bezels are on it
[1350.28 → 1352.48] We just want to connect
[1352.48 → 1353.20] With each other
[1353.20 → 1354.06] And that
[1354.06 → 1355.22] That is what
[1355.22 → 1355.96] Apple is enabling
[1355.96 → 1356.74] That's malarkey
[1356.74 → 1357.90] For the uninitiated
[1357.90 → 1358.16] This
[1358.16 → 1359.58] This is what's happening
[1359.58 → 1360.94] They are at least internally
[1360.94 → 1362.48] Calling their stores
[1362.48 → 1363.12] The Apple Store
[1363.12 → 1363.76] Is now called
[1363.76 → 1364.44] Oh man
[1364.44 → 1365.34] Twitch chat
[1365.34 → 1365.60] Is like
[1365.60 → 1366.46] Linus stop
[1366.46 → 1367.74] Linus stop
[1367.74 → 1369.28] No stop
[1369.28 → 1370.92] Or town square
[1370.92 → 1371.68] Town square
[1371.68 → 1372.04] Sorry
[1372.04 → 1373.44] Whatever it's called
[1373.44 → 1373.76] Question
[1373.76 → 1375.34] Question the first
[1375.34 → 1376.66] Do they expect
[1376.66 → 1377.78] The public
[1377.78 → 1378.76] To refer to them
[1378.76 → 1379.20] That way
[1379.20 → 1381.96] I would say
[1381.96 → 1382.52] Keep dreaming
[1382.52 → 1384.12] But Apple people
[1384.12 → 1385.16] Apple people
[1385.16 → 1385.66] Man
[1385.66 → 1385.94] I mean
[1385.94 → 1386.34] They'll do it
[1386.34 → 1386.84] They're going to do it
[1386.84 → 1387.58] You can get them
[1387.58 → 1389.24] To call it a magic mouse
[1389.24 → 1390.42] If you can get them
[1390.42 → 1391.12] To call something
[1391.12 → 1392.10] A magic mouse
[1392.10 → 1392.78] Then I think
[1392.78 → 1393.34] You can get
[1393.34 → 1394.16] I want to see someone
[1394.16 → 1395.86] Who has a bad experience
[1395.86 → 1396.42] Oh
[1396.42 → 1397.60] Be mad about it
[1397.60 → 1398.72] And still call it that way
[1398.72 → 1399.66] So I went to the
[1399.66 → 1400.86] Apple town square today
[1400.86 → 1402.70] And the geniuses there
[1402.70 → 1403.44] Totally sucked
[1403.44 → 1404.06] So they had to call
[1404.06 → 1404.50] The mayor
[1404.50 → 1405.54] Because he's the only one
[1405.54 → 1406.44] That knows what's going on
[1406.44 → 1407.06] The mayor
[1407.06 → 1409.56] I assume
[1409.56 → 1410.58] It goes all the way
[1410.58 → 1411.06] And the manager
[1411.06 → 1411.96] Is called the mayor now
[1411.96 → 1414.06] Maybe
[1414.06 → 1417.26] An everyday zombie
[1417.26 → 1418.68] Says
[1418.68 → 1419.78] Can you stop
[1419.78 → 1421.56] Mansplaining right now
[1421.56 → 1424.12] What a wanner
[1424.12 → 1424.62] Okay
[1424.62 → 1425.46] I like that
[1425.46 → 1426.08] I like that
[1426.08 → 1426.66] That's pretty good
[1426.66 → 1427.94] Apple town mayor
[1427.94 → 1429.38] Mayor yes
[1429.38 → 1432.04] Okay
[1432.04 → 1432.62] Okay fine
[1432.62 → 1433.68] So that was your first question
[1433.68 → 1434.24] The answer
[1434.24 → 1434.74] Honestly
[1434.74 → 1436.32] I'm actually going to go with no
[1436.32 → 1438.08] I don't think
[1438.08 → 1440.56] Anyone is gonna start calling it
[1440.56 → 1441.24] Like
[1441.24 → 1442.62] You can get people to call it
[1442.62 → 1443.30] Apple Store
[1443.30 → 1445.08] Because that's what it is
[1445.08 → 1445.32] Yeah
[1445.32 → 1447.14] It's a store where you buy apples
[1447.14 → 1447.80] No wait
[1447.80 → 1448.66] It's not
[1448.66 → 1450.58] They can do anything
[1450.58 → 1452.82] Second question
[1452.82 → 1453.88] Are they going to change the sign
[1453.88 → 1454.62] Okay
[1454.62 → 1456.24] Okay
[1456.24 → 1456.82] Okay
[1456.82 → 1459.20] So I actually didn't look that closely
[1459.20 → 1461.24] At the designs
[1461.24 → 1462.48] For these
[1462.48 → 1465.50] But if I had to guess
[1465.50 → 1467.00] Like I don't even think
[1467.00 → 1467.94] Here hold on a second
[1467.94 → 1469.10] Apple town
[1469.10 → 1470.18] Town square
[1470.18 → 1470.70] Here we go
[1470.70 → 1472.90] Let's get some images up here
[1472.90 → 1473.94] Because if I had to guess
[1473.94 → 1474.90] I would say they probably
[1474.90 → 1476.40] Would just have an Apple logo
[1476.40 → 1478.80] That would be my guess
[1478.80 → 1479.06] Yeah
[1479.06 → 1479.62] So look
[1479.62 → 1479.80] Yeah
[1479.80 → 1480.14] I think
[1480.14 → 1480.84] I think that's where
[1480.84 → 1482.10] That's a rectangle
[1482.10 → 1483.54] Okay
[1483.54 → 1483.86] No, no
[1483.86 → 1485.22] Oh shut up
[1485.22 → 1487.46] I'm not even
[1487.46 → 1488.50] If you stand in the corner
[1488.50 → 1489.68] Can you call it the apple ramen
[1489.68 → 1491.52] This town square here
[1491.52 → 1493.12] Just has like an Apple logo
[1493.12 → 1494.32] This is clearly
[1494.32 → 1495.62] An exceptional example
[1495.62 → 1496.38] That's outdoor
[1496.38 → 1497.48] It's literally a plaza
[1497.48 → 1498.20] No that's like
[1498.20 → 1499.26] The idea though
[1499.26 → 1500.74] But most Apple stores
[1500.74 → 1502.18] Are in malls
[1502.18 → 1502.82] That's true
[1502.82 → 1503.40] But I think
[1503.40 → 1504.34] The idea behind
[1504.34 → 1506.32] Some of these town squares
[1506.32 → 1507.36] Is that they're actually
[1507.36 → 1508.52] Like acquiring
[1508.52 → 1510.40] Like what was this
[1510.40 → 1511.56] Building that they said
[1511.56 → 1512.20] I think they said
[1512.20 → 1512.78] They bought
[1512.78 → 1514.44] Like some historic building
[1514.44 → 1515.10] In like
[1515.10 → 1516.70] Italy or some crap
[1516.70 → 1517.38] Like this thing
[1517.38 → 1518.18] They're going to have
[1518.18 → 1519.36] Their flagship stores
[1519.36 → 1521.60] Yeah see
[1521.60 → 1522.24] But here
[1522.24 → 1523.40] It doesn't say Apple Store
[1523.40 → 1524.58] It's just an Apple logo
[1524.58 → 1527.34] But they are changing
[1527.34 → 1529.30] The design of the retail space
[1529.30 → 1530.24] To facilitate
[1530.24 → 1531.42] Some kind of human interaction
[1531.42 → 1531.64] Yeah
[1531.64 → 1533.10] And they're planning to bring in
[1533.10 → 1535.22] Actual experts on things
[1535.22 → 1537.20] Although they were saying
[1537.20 → 1538.22] That this new position
[1538.22 → 1538.74] They've created
[1538.74 → 1539.96] Like creative something
[1539.96 → 1541.90] Will be to creatives
[1541.90 → 1543.10] What the genius is
[1543.10 → 1543.96] To whatever
[1543.96 → 1544.70] And I'm kind of like
[1544.70 → 1545.86] Well if it's a genius
[1545.86 → 1546.28] Then
[1546.28 → 1548.00] Like if we're creating
[1548.00 → 1549.56] An analog for geniuses
[1549.56 → 1550.44] Then my expectations
[1550.44 → 1551.36] Are fairly low
[1551.36 → 1553.42] Ouch
[1553.42 → 1554.62] Apparently it was in France
[1554.62 → 1555.26] Sizzler
[1555.26 → 1556.50] Europe somewhere
[1556.50 → 1557.36] Why don't we go with that
[1557.36 → 1557.60] France
[1557.60 → 1559.42] Okay
[1559.42 → 1560.08] So
[1560.08 → 1562.20] What was your second question
[1562.20 → 1562.68] I don't remember
[1562.68 → 1563.48] Talked about the sign
[1563.48 → 1563.82] Yeah
[1563.82 → 1566.12] Are they actually expecting
[1566.12 → 1567.18] People to talk to each other
[1567.18 → 1567.42] In there
[1567.42 → 1568.40] Because you don't
[1568.40 → 1569.16] You go in there
[1569.16 → 1569.74] And you look at the
[1569.74 → 1570.88] Apple stuff that you
[1570.88 → 1571.40] Want to look at
[1571.40 → 1572.24] And you still don't talk
[1572.24 → 1572.82] To other humans
[1572.82 → 1573.82] Who are just shopping in there
[1573.82 → 1575.52] Well here's a question though
[1575.52 → 1576.24] You're explaining
[1576.24 → 1578.06] Your Apple shopper
[1578.06 → 1578.96] Spraining right now
[1578.96 → 1580.54] Because I don't think
[1580.54 → 1581.62] You've ever actually
[1581.62 → 1582.60] Walked into an Apple Store
[1582.60 → 1583.20] And bought something
[1583.20 → 1584.48] Oh except for that time
[1584.48 → 1585.26] That you wanted to get
[1585.26 → 1585.88] A red iPhone
[1585.88 → 1586.50] To make a video
[1586.50 → 1587.38] And I went to the mall
[1587.38 → 1588.06] And I was the one
[1588.06 → 1588.98] Who bought that red iPhone
[1588.98 → 1589.44] And brought it back
[1589.44 → 1589.94] To the office
[1589.94 → 1592.10] Yeah but you
[1592.10 → 1593.14] Didn't buy it
[1593.14 → 1594.54] Okay I didn't go through
[1594.54 → 1595.20] Like the shopping
[1595.20 → 1596.20] You handed over
[1596.20 → 1597.06] Company money
[1597.06 → 1598.44] To walk out of the store
[1598.44 → 1599.16] With something
[1599.16 → 1600.14] For company use
[1600.14 → 1600.64] In and out
[1600.64 → 1601.20] In two minutes
[1601.20 → 1601.58] Yes
[1601.58 → 1603.28] So
[1603.28 → 1605.80] As someone who is
[1605.80 → 1606.36] Not
[1606.36 → 1607.20] Cult of Apple
[1607.20 → 1608.52] Can you really
[1608.52 → 1609.34] Cult of Apple
[1609.34 → 1609.88] Spain
[1609.88 → 1610.96] To people who are
[1610.96 → 1611.90] Apple shoppers
[1611.90 → 1613.98] So like
[1613.98 → 1614.66] Normal
[1614.66 → 1615.96] Cult of Apple people
[1615.96 → 1616.54] They go in there
[1616.54 → 1617.60] They rub shoulders
[1617.60 → 1619.30] Like a collective boner
[1619.30 → 1620.32] Giddiness about how
[1620.32 → 1621.04] Sweet Apple is
[1621.04 → 1621.70] And they kind of like
[1621.70 → 1623.18] They experience the process
[1623.18 → 1623.68] And they look up
[1623.68 → 1624.28] At each other's eyes
[1624.28 → 1624.72] And they're like
[1624.72 → 1625.74] Are you seeing this
[1625.74 → 1626.44] This is so sick
[1626.44 → 1628.14] Is that the idea here
[1628.14 → 1629.16] I don't know
[1629.16 → 1629.90] Actually
[1629.90 → 1631.08] I'm not much of an
[1631.08 → 1631.96] Apple shopper either
[1631.96 → 1633.50] So you know what
[1633.50 → 1633.68] We need someone
[1633.68 → 1634.36] Apple split us
[1634.36 → 1634.86] Okay alright
[1634.86 → 1636.24] Let's stop with
[1636.24 → 1637.34] The blue balls
[1637.34 → 1638.24] We'll talk about the phone
[1638.24 → 1639.68] iPhone 8
[1639.68 → 1641.88] Shockingly iterative
[1641.88 → 1643.16] To me
[1643.16 → 1643.80] 7S
[1643.80 → 1644.62] You can tell
[1644.62 → 1645.60] I don't understand
[1645.60 → 1646.80] Why they called it 8
[1646.80 → 1647.74] Neither do I
[1647.74 → 1648.74] The only reason
[1648.74 → 1649.88] That I can think of
[1649.88 → 1651.10] Is that this is
[1651.10 → 1651.96] A gradual
[1651.96 → 1653.24] Phase out
[1653.24 → 1654.68] Of
[1654.68 → 1655.92] Having
[1655.92 → 1657.14] Because right now
[1657.14 → 1657.88] They've got what
[1657.88 → 1658.86] They've got the SE
[1658.86 → 1660.12] Which isn't numbered
[1660.12 → 1660.58] At all
[1660.58 → 1661.52] Right
[1661.52 → 1662.58] Then they've got
[1662.58 → 1663.86] The iPhone number
[1663.86 → 1665.64] Then they've got
[1665.64 → 1666.28] The iPhone
[1666.28 → 1667.26] We skipped a number
[1667.26 → 1668.36] And it's 10 now
[1668.36 → 1669.12] For some reason
[1669.12 → 1670.28] Because 10th anniversary
[1670.28 → 1671.46] And it's not a numeral
[1671.46 → 1673.20] So if I had to guess
[1673.20 → 1674.76] Well they called it 10 though
[1674.76 → 1676.48] Yeah, but it's a Roman numeral 10
[1676.48 → 1676.76] Yeah
[1676.76 → 1677.48] It's not like a
[1677.48 → 1678.42] A 1's euro
[1678.42 → 1679.64] So it's clearly separate
[1679.64 → 1680.96] So if I had to guess
[1680.96 → 1681.66] What they're doing
[1681.66 → 1683.26] Is they are
[1683.26 → 1684.92] Changing the lineup
[1684.92 → 1687.16] So that the regular numbers
[1687.16 → 1689.42] Are just going to be
[1689.42 → 1690.20] The replacement
[1690.20 → 1692.04] For what an SE would have been
[1692.04 → 1693.46] And we're going to get
[1693.46 → 1694.52] No 8S
[1694.52 → 1695.84] We're just going to get a 9
[1695.84 → 1697.34] And we're going to be using
[1697.34 → 1698.42] That same
[1698.42 → 1699.92] Body design
[1699.92 → 1700.52] That we've had
[1700.52 → 1701.48] Since the 6
[1701.48 → 1702.80] We're going to be using
[1702.80 → 1703.74] That like kind of
[1703.74 → 1704.82] For a bit
[1704.82 → 1706.36] On the value option
[1706.36 → 1707.32] Yeah okay
[1707.32 → 1708.08] And then
[1708.08 → 1709.12] That gives them
[1709.12 → 1710.44] One more generation
[1710.44 → 1711.68] To kind of get people
[1711.68 → 1712.62] Used to this idea
[1712.62 → 1714.04] And it buys them
[1714.04 → 1715.72] Then two full years
[1715.72 → 1717.26] For OLED panels
[1717.26 → 1718.32] To get more reasonable
[1718.32 → 1719.90] So that they can bring
[1719.90 → 1720.30] The
[1720.30 → 1721.44] X
[1721.44 → 1722.64] Xi
[1722.64 → 1724.24] And 12
[1724.24 → 1725.28] Whatever they're going to call it
[1725.28 → 1726.50] This more premium design
[1726.50 → 1728.52] So they can bring that
[1728.52 → 1730.94] Into the kinds of price points
[1730.94 → 1731.68] That they want
[1731.68 → 1732.54] For their step-down
[1732.54 → 1733.42] So the whole lineup
[1733.42 → 1734.58] Is gonna look like
[1734.58 → 1735.98] Xi
[1735.98 → 1737.70] And then
[1737.70 → 1738.42] Last gen
[1738.42 → 1739.02] X
[1739.02 → 1740.14] So that'll be
[1740.14 → 1741.14] Your top of the line
[1741.14 → 1742.08] And then your step-down
[1742.08 → 1743.22] And then
[1743.22 → 1744.26] You're going to have
[1744.26 → 1744.80] The
[1744.80 → 1745.66] Kind of the
[1745.66 → 1746.64] The cheapo line
[1746.64 → 1747.86] Is going to be the
[1747.86 → 1748.44] 9
[1748.44 → 1749.72] And like
[1749.72 → 1750.32] The SE
[1750.32 → 1751.18] Or something like that
[1751.18 → 1752.04] Do you think they'll call it 9?
[1752.44 → 1753.32] I think
[1753.32 → 1753.86] Maybe
[1753.86 → 1754.58] Give it a new name
[1754.58 → 1755.38] Just like SE was a new name
[1755.38 → 1755.56] Yeah
[1755.56 → 1756.52] Or they might do away
[1756.52 → 1757.58] With numbers entirely
[1757.58 → 1758.96] And so they might have
[1758.96 → 1759.66] Like an SE
[1759.66 → 1760.32] And then like
[1760.32 → 1761.40] Something else entirely
[1761.40 → 1762.08] And basically
[1762.08 → 1763.06] I think they're starting
[1763.06 → 1763.76] Over at X
[1763.76 → 1765.22] Or
[1765.22 → 1766.36] That line extension's
[1766.36 → 1766.90] Huge though
[1766.90 → 1767.36] Or
[1767.36 → 1768.54] Get this
[1768.54 → 1770.62] Before we go into
[1770.62 → 1771.48] Our sponsor spots
[1771.48 → 1771.90] For the day
[1771.90 → 1772.88] I have one more
[1772.88 → 1773.70] Theory bomb
[1773.70 → 1774.54] To drop on you
[1774.54 → 1775.62] Oh what am I going to do?
[1775.70 → 1777.10] You know how OS X
[1777.10 → 1779.42] Has just been OS X forever?
[1779.72 → 1779.98] Yeah
[1779.98 → 1781.18] What if this is just
[1781.18 → 1782.00] iPhone X
[1782.00 → 1782.74] Forever?
[1782.74 → 1784.82] Because
[1784.82 → 1785.92] Apple
[1785.92 → 1787.28] Is responsible
[1787.28 → 1788.38] For this
[1788.38 → 1789.04] Naming
[1789.04 → 1789.96] BS
[1789.96 → 1791.08] That seems to have
[1791.08 → 1792.00] Taken over
[1792.00 → 1792.80] The technology
[1792.80 → 1793.66] Industry
[1793.66 → 1794.88] Where they just
[1794.88 → 1795.76] Call the product
[1795.76 → 1796.60] The same thing
[1796.60 → 1797.66] They did last year
[1797.66 → 1799.30] And
[1799.30 → 1800.14] The fact that
[1800.14 → 1801.34] It is so confusing
[1801.34 → 1802.28] For consumers
[1802.28 → 1803.76] Don't worry about it
[1803.76 → 1805.02] We're just going to do it
[1805.02 → 1808.08] What if it's just
[1808.08 → 1809.34] iPhone X?
[1809.34 → 1810.26] I don't think that's
[1810.26 → 1811.14] Going to be the case
[1811.14 → 1812.40] Because on the iPhone
[1812.40 → 1813.62] They still haven't done it
[1813.62 → 1814.56] They still haven't gone
[1814.56 → 1815.30] No this is just
[1815.30 → 1815.84] The new Mac
[1815.84 → 1816.64] They are the masters
[1816.64 → 1817.54] Of making you want
[1817.54 → 1818.30] The newest thing
[1818.30 → 1818.84] Every year
[1818.84 → 1819.76] You don't need
[1819.76 → 1821.02] An X right now
[1821.02 → 1821.78] If you have a 7
[1821.78 → 1822.90] But you fucking
[1822.90 → 1823.62] Want one, don't you?
[1823.82 → 1824.62] Do we drop F-bombs
[1824.62 → 1824.90] In the monitor?
[1825.04 → 1826.42] No we don't
[1826.42 → 1827.64] Sorry everyone
[1827.64 → 1829.72] You want one though
[1829.72 → 1831.12] You want one
[1831.12 → 1831.50] Okay
[1831.50 → 1832.16] But
[1832.16 → 1833.00] But then why would
[1833.00 → 1834.00] They do that on the MacBook?
[1835.14 → 1835.92] Why would they do it
[1835.92 → 1836.66] On the MacBook Pro?
[1836.66 → 1837.68] Why do they just call it
[1837.68 → 1838.90] MacBook Pro every time?
[1838.96 → 1840.28] See Apple TV
[1840.28 → 1841.12] I don't know
[1841.12 → 1841.86] But then
[1841.86 → 1842.62] But then they went
[1842.62 → 1843.56] And they broke the system
[1843.56 → 1844.32] They called it
[1844.32 → 1845.74] The Apple TV 4K
[1845.74 → 1847.34] See I don't know
[1847.34 → 1848.08] What they're doing
[1848.08 → 1848.70] I think they should
[1848.70 → 1849.34] Just do years
[1849.34 → 1850.44] We should all just do years
[1850.44 → 1851.30] I like it
[1851.30 → 1852.58] I like the MacBook 2016
[1852.58 → 1853.36] No because what if you launch
[1853.36 → 1854.84] Two products in a year?
[1855.02 → 1855.90] 16 Q2
[1855.90 → 1856.66] 16 2
[1856.66 → 1857.36] Oh
[1857.36 → 1857.70] Whatever
[1857.70 → 1858.80] 16 and a half
[1858.80 → 1859.56] That's worse
[1859.56 → 1860.90] They do that with car model years
[1860.90 → 1864.66] Don't stare
[1864.66 → 1865.08] Blink
[1865.08 → 1866.10] Give them a blink
[1866.10 → 1866.52] Come on
[1866.52 → 1869.28] I'll blink for you guys
[1869.28 → 1873.54] This episode of the WAN Show

[1919.82 → 1921.60] So head over to FreshBooks.com

[1926.90 → 1929.62] In how did you hear about us section
[1929.62 → 1931.96] I think I managed to do that whole spot
[1931.96 → 1933.24] Without any of my notes
[1933.24 → 1934.42] Which is good
[1934.42 → 1935.34] Because this tab
[1935.34 → 1936.54] And you're telling me to dial back the shill
[1936.54 → 1937.34] This tab is
[1937.34 → 1937.98] Well no
[1937.98 → 1938.94] You're experienced shill
[1938.94 → 1941.38] Your silliness is just crappy though
[1941.38 → 1942.60] You're just bad at it
[1942.60 → 1944.78] Oh we'll consult the Twitch chat for that
[1944.78 → 1945.40] We'll consult
[1945.40 → 1945.68] No
[1945.68 → 1947.40] Twitch chat always
[1947.40 → 1949.90] Always sides against me
[1949.90 → 1950.62] Exactly
[1950.62 → 1951.96] They never back me up
[1951.96 → 1953.54] You're a perfect proxy for the truth
[1953.54 → 1954.78] No
[1954.78 → 1957.24] They just love to hate
[1957.24 → 1958.34] They love to hate
[1958.34 → 1959.88] Oh
[1959.88 → 1960.68] Oh
[1960.68 → 1962.42] Also on the show this week

[1963.76 → 1964.28] Where is it?
[1964.58 → 1965.10] Don't leave me
[1965.10 → 1965.44] Where is it?
[1965.52 → 1966.02] Where is it?
[1966.38 → 1966.78] Okay
[1966.78 → 1967.82] Ha
[1967.82 → 1969.32] I get to punish you
[1969.32 → 1970.50] Dude
[1970.50 → 1971.74] I can take that
[1971.74 → 1972.26] This
[1972.26 → 1973.02] Like a champ
[1973.02 → 1974.06] And give me the spiciest one
[1974.06 → 1974.70] This
[1974.70 → 1978.16] This is for dropping F-bombs on the show
[1978.16 → 1979.00] Bring it on
[1979.00 → 1980.54] Alright
[1980.54 → 1982.68] Savage jerky
[1982.68 → 1985.00] Jerky made with the best ingredients
[1985.00 → 1986.10] Without nitrate
[1986.10 → 1987.38] Nitrates or preservatives
[1987.38 → 1988.76] The goal was to create a snack
[1988.76 → 1990.20] That was full of flavour
[1990.20 → 1992.10] And let me tell you
[1992.10 → 1994.42] This is full of so much flavour
[1994.42 → 1996.76] That it doesn't just affect your mouth
[1996.76 → 1998.24] I'm a vegetarian
[1998.24 → 1999.80] No you aren't
[1999.80 → 2000.32] I am
[2000.32 → 2000.98] Are you really?
[2001.10 → 2001.36] Yeah
[2001.36 → 2002.26] Wait what?
[2002.44 → 2003.08] I'll eat it though
[2003.08 → 2003.52] What?
[2004.00 → 2005.30] Since when are you a vegetarian?
[2005.98 → 2007.40] Well why would you say you can handle it?
[2007.44 → 2008.64] Why did you say to give it to you?
[2008.66 → 2010.54] Because in the past I've eaten wings that need
[2010.54 → 2012.06] That require a waiver to be signed
[2012.06 → 2016.74] And I'm positive that this isn't near as spicy as that
[2016.74 → 2017.90] Really?
[2018.20 → 2018.66] This is
[2018.66 → 2019.58] I'll do it for science
[2019.58 → 2021.10] This is Carolina Reaper
[2021.10 → 2022.90] Jerky
[2022.90 → 2023.88] You know that right?
[2023.88 → 2024.54] What does that mean?
[2024.60 → 2025.42] Those are just words to me
[2025.42 → 2026.46] Those are just words
[2026.46 → 2027.10] Okay
[2027.10 → 2028.90] Which Carolina are we talking?
[2029.00 → 2029.46] South or north?
[2030.14 → 2031.36] If it's spicy it's got to be south
[2031.36 → 2032.56] I don't think it matters
[2032.56 → 2034.12] Am I supposed to eat the whole thing at once?
[2034.46 → 2035.22] Um no
[2035.22 → 2036.22] I would not
[2036.22 → 2037.22] No I would not recommend
[2037.22 → 2039.36] What are you doing?
[2039.82 → 2040.66] Your body
[2040.66 → 2042.60] Your body's going to hate you
[2042.60 → 2043.60] Okay
[2043.60 → 2044.92] Um so anyway
[2044.92 → 2044.94] Um so anyway

[2060.16 → 2061.82] They've got lots of other great flavours
[2061.82 → 2064.84] Um like their sea salt is perfect
[2064.84 → 2066.96] Um Luke really likes the traditional
[2066.96 → 2068.24] That one's not my favourite
[2068.24 → 2069.72] I like the mojo or Moho
[2069.72 → 2070.54] Or whatever it is
[2070.54 → 2071.82] We don't have any of that right now
[2071.82 → 2074.54] So I guess I'll settle for uh
[2074.54 → 2075.74] No I'll settle for some traditional
[2075.74 → 2076.84] Traditional's pretty good
[2076.84 → 2078.16] Um so yeah
[2078.16 → 2080.10] Go check them out over at um
[2080.10 → 2082.80] Savagejerky.com
[2082.80 → 2087.62] You have to be suffering right now
[2087.62 → 2090.42] This is pretty good jerky
[2090.42 → 2092.16] It is good jerky
[2092.16 → 2093.56] But you have to be suffering
[2093.56 → 2093.88] No
[2093.88 → 2095.12] I don't buy it
[2095.12 → 2096.84] No matter how straight of a face you keep
[2096.84 → 2099.26] There's absolutely no way
[2099.26 → 2100.62] That that's not painful
[2100.62 → 2103.24] Alright synergy
[2103.24 → 2103.84] I am perspiring
[2103.84 → 2107.12] Okay
[2107.12 → 2110.02] Yeah you got some perspiration action going on there
[2110.02 → 2111.74] And I will admit that I'm doing some
[2111.74 → 2113.40] Mind over matter WIM Of stuff here
[2113.40 → 2115.62] Like it's pretty
[2115.62 → 2116.22] Like you got
[2116.22 → 2117.34] Your eyes are watery
[2117.34 → 2119.26] A little bit more watery than before
[2119.26 → 2120.30] They're a little glossier
[2120.30 → 2121.98] Synergy
[2121.98 → 2122.92] It's spicy
[2122.92 → 2124.72] It's spicy
[2124.72 → 2126.38] That's a spicy jerky I've had
[2126.38 → 2129.44] Synergy is a software download
[2129.44 → 2132.94] That solves the problem of having two keyboards and two mice once and for all
[2132.94 → 2137.32] You can share one mouse and one keyboard between two or more computers
[2137.32 → 2140.06] So you'll no longer confuse which one is for which
[2140.06 → 2143.74] And I think the coolest thing about it is that it works cross-platform
[2143.74 → 2146.60] Windows, Mac, even Linux
[2146.60 → 2149.20] You can seamlessly move your mouse across the screens
[2149.20 → 2151.14] They've got great options
[2151.14 → 2152.44] Great options
[2152.44 → 2153.14] Great features
[2153.14 → 2155.12] Like clipboard sharing between the computers
[2155.12 → 2156.52] Drag and dropping files
[2156.52 → 2158.02] The ability to set up hotkeys
[2158.02 → 2158.52] That is sweet
[2158.52 → 2159.14] And more
[2159.14 → 2163.28] And they offer a basic and pro option with a one time payment for lifetime access
[2163.28 → 2167.50] So head over to seamless.com slash synergy slash Linus29
[2167.50 → 2170.06] Wow what a terrible vanity URL
[2170.06 → 2172.82] And you can save 50%
[2172.82 → 2175.04] So it's worth typing in all that nonsense
[2175.04 → 2177.78] In order to get a great deal on a great piece of software
[2177.78 → 2179.96] Is that how old you were when they became a sponsor?
[2181.00 → 2182.16] No I'm not that old
[2182.16 → 2184.02] You're not 29
[2184.02 → 2187.32] Okay I got to give you props
[2187.32 → 2189.86] For holding up that well to the Reaper jerky
[2189.86 → 2190.60] It's worse now
[2190.60 → 2191.80] It's worse now than it's been
[2191.80 → 2193.54] I'm suffering now
[2193.54 → 2194.24] It gets you
[2194.24 → 2197.18] Oh let me tell you the suffering has already just begun
[2197.18 → 2198.24] Oh I'm aware
[2198.24 → 2200.52] I have diarrhea everyday anyway
[2200.52 → 2202.42] Can we talk about the NVIDIA?
[2203.76 → 2204.50] The rumour?
[2205.10 → 2205.64] That they're working on
[2205.64 → 2207.36] No, no I'm not done with the iPhone 8 yet
[2207.36 → 2208.18] Oh god
[2208.18 → 2209.52] Or we haven't even talked about the X
[2209.52 → 2210.62] Or X rather
[2210.62 → 2211.76] I want to talk about its bezel
[2211.76 → 2213.38] Okay so the 8 is super iterative
[2213.38 → 2215.80] Whatever it's got slightly better kind of everything
[2215.80 → 2217.66] The X
[2217.66 → 2220.54] I hate the speaker
[2220.54 → 2222.38] And face
[2222.38 → 2223.98] Face detection
[2223.98 → 2226.82] Face ID cutout
[2226.82 → 2227.46] What's the speaker?
[2228.62 → 2230.20] That's that cutout at the top
[2230.20 → 2230.90] Oh that thing
[2230.90 → 2231.56] I don't mind that
[2231.56 → 2235.96] When you're watching videos on that though
[2235.96 → 2237.42] Come on
[2237.42 → 2238.58] Have you seen
[2238.58 → 2241.18] Have you seen what it looks like when you're watching a video on it?
[2241.82 → 2243.34] Yeah it's got like a little cutout
[2243.34 → 2244.88] Yeah I don't mind it
[2244.88 → 2245.78] It's horrible
[2245.78 → 2248.90] I mean I might get used to it really fast
[2248.90 → 2250.48] In my review I might be like
[2250.48 → 2251.50] You know what?
[2252.14 → 2252.96] This is fine
[2252.96 → 2254.36] It's totally cool
[2254.36 → 2254.94] Forget it
[2254.94 → 2259.76] But I love Touch ID
[2259.76 → 2263.12] I'm actually super the opposite of stoked
[2263.12 → 2264.46] That we're getting rid of Touch ID
[2264.46 → 2264.94] Agreed
[2264.94 → 2269.92] I think that getting into
[2269.92 → 2271.12] Getting into
[2271.12 → 2271.90] Where's the
[2271.90 → 2274.46] Where's that article that you brought up?
[2275.02 → 2276.00] Thanks Bixby
[2276.00 → 2277.66] Bixby is activated right now
[2277.66 → 2279.46] He's trying to help
[2279.46 → 2280.36] Where
[2280.36 → 2280.84] The
[2280.84 → 2281.42] There's
[2281.42 → 2283.34] Where's that article that you brought up?
[2283.46 → 2284.06] Thanks Bixby
[2284.06 → 2285.72] Bixby's activated right now
[2285.72 → 2287.20] That we're getting into
[2287.20 → 2287.86] Where there's
[2287.86 → 2289.18] Where's that article that you brought up?
[2289.22 → 2289.84] Thanks Bixby
[2289.84 → 2291.30] Bixby's activated right now
[2291.30 → 2292.20] Change password to James is the best
[2292.20 → 2295.84] into where there's worse, that article that you brought up. Set reminder to give James a raise.
[2297.72 → 2300.04] Is it working? That you brought up time to give James
[2300.04 → 2304.18] a raise. Actually, we need to unlock
[2304.18 → 2307.94] the phone first. Bixby's on my side. Alright, Bixby's with you.
[2309.26 → 2310.60] Okay, so where's that?
[2311.80 → 2316.16] Okay, so aside from... Okay, so they claim
[2316.16 → 2319.48] Face ID is more secure, but Senator Al Frankel
[2319.48 → 2323.72] has actually questioned Apple about the security
[2323.72 → 2326.52] of their Face ID
[2326.52 → 2329.98] and has raised some fairly interesting
[2329.98 → 2332.72] points here. Namely,
[2333.22 → 2336.38] so Apple has stated that all Face Print data will be stored locally
[2336.38 → 2339.16] on an individual's device as opposed to being sent to the cloud.
[2340.18 → 2343.74] So, is it currently possible, either remotely or through physical access
[2343.74 → 2347.48] to the device, for either Apple or a third party to extract and obtain
[2347.48 → 2349.88] usable Face Print data from the iPhone X?
[2350.92 → 2353.72] Is there any foreseeable reason why Apple would decide to begin
[2353.72 → 2354.94] storing such data remotely?
[2355.64 → 2358.10] Apple has stated it used more than one billion images
[2358.10 → 2359.82] in developing the Face ID algorithm.
[2360.38 → 2362.80] Where did these one billion face images come from?
[2362.84 → 2363.76] That's less relevant to me.
[2364.40 → 2365.80] Really? You don't think that's interesting?
[2367.08 → 2368.06] It could be,
[2368.44 → 2370.24] but the answer could be very mundane.
[2370.88 → 2371.82] It could be Shutterstock.
[2372.52 → 2374.46] It could be just public images of faces.
[2374.46 → 2376.50] Where would you get a billion images of faces?
[2376.80 → 2377.34] The internet.
[2377.98 → 2378.40] Well, yeah.
[2378.40 → 2379.14] The whole internet.
[2380.04 → 2383.26] Yeah, but then how would you guarantee that you have the rights
[2383.26 → 2384.00] to use it?
[2384.60 → 2386.60] Because the whole terms of service
[2386.60 → 2389.70] where you can collect non-personally identifying information,
[2389.92 → 2391.88] the thing that people usually agree to
[2391.88 → 2394.44] is that it's not supposed to be personally identifying.
[2394.58 → 2396.36] Your face is by definition
[2396.36 → 2397.96] personally identifying.
[2397.96 → 2401.04] What steps did Apple take to ensure its system
[2401.04 → 2402.88] was trained on a diverse set of faces
[2402.88 → 2404.36] in terms of race, gender, and age?
[2405.00 → 2407.90] How are they protecting against racial, gender, or age bias
[2407.90 → 2408.56] in Face ID?
[2409.26 → 2411.88] In the unveiling of the iPhone X,
[2411.96 → 2413.56] Apple made numerous assurances
[2413.56 → 2415.36] about the accuracy and sophistication.
[2415.74 → 2417.40] Please describe again all the steps
[2417.40 → 2418.28] that Apple has taken
[2418.28 → 2420.62] to ensure that Face ID can distinguish
[2420.62 → 2422.98] an individual's face from a photograph or mask,
[2423.00 → 2423.36] for example.
[2423.36 → 2427.20] Apple, I would love to do a death mask.
[2428.36 → 2431.96] And then, I don't know exactly how we'd do it.
[2432.04 → 2433.94] I would love to have a Linus mask.
[2435.60 → 2438.38] Can I, uh, if we make one for the video, okay?
[2438.64 → 2440.12] No, you can't have it.
[2440.52 → 2441.46] You're never going to use it again.
[2441.54 → 2442.82] That is so weird.
[2443.90 → 2445.02] Drop all, if we made Linus masks.
[2445.02 → 2446.28] Would you wear it while you watch?
[2449.58 → 2451.80] You can't drop F-bombs, you can say that.
[2451.80 → 2454.02] Okay, if we had one in the merch store.
[2454.08 → 2455.80] Look, we have to draw the line somewhere.
[2455.92 → 2457.80] How many people would be Linus for Halloween?
[2458.00 → 2459.90] We all know I wasn't going to stop saying
[2459.90 → 2461.76] weird sexual stuff, so.
[2462.62 → 2464.56] Okay, at least that can go over somebody's head.
[2464.72 → 2466.18] Whereas F-bombs are just F-bombs.
[2466.52 → 2467.16] Yeah, see?
[2469.44 → 2470.42] The answer is yes.
[2470.58 → 2471.06] Yes, I would.
[2471.18 → 2472.14] It would enhance the experience.
[2472.58 → 2474.64] Can Apple confirm that it has no plans
[2474.64 → 2476.36] to use face print data for any purpose
[2476.36 → 2477.88] other than the operation of Face ID?
[2478.00 → 2478.96] These are all good questions.
[2479.14 → 2479.26] That's a big one.
[2479.26 → 2481.58] The biggest one for me is,
[2481.66 → 2483.86] is Face ID really going to be more convenient
[2483.86 → 2485.82] than Touch ID?
[2486.10 → 2487.70] And that's one that I'm having some trouble with.
[2488.14 → 2491.44] Because they did show it operating
[2491.44 → 2493.58] not directly staring at the phone,
[2493.72 → 2495.50] which is the biggest issue I have right now
[2495.50 → 2496.48] with Iris ID.
[2496.98 → 2498.74] By the time I go like this,
[2498.84 → 2499.56] and I swear,
[2499.68 → 2502.00] probably a good 40 to 50% of the time I use it,
[2502.06 → 2502.26] I'm like...
[2503.54 → 2504.22] That's gash.
[2504.32 → 2504.64] You don't want to.
[2504.64 → 2505.50] Playing around with it.
[2505.50 → 2507.60] A lot of the time,
[2507.64 → 2509.84] it would be faster for me to just key in a pen.
[2510.16 → 2512.46] Because fingerprint unlock on the back of your device,
[2512.66 → 2514.08] which you iPhone people aren't used to,
[2514.52 → 2515.66] you can unlock that sucker
[2515.66 → 2516.88] while it's still in your pocket,
[2516.94 → 2517.88] and you bring it to your face,
[2517.90 → 2518.82] it's already there.
[2519.48 → 2521.64] So you're saying that they demonstrated this thing,
[2521.78 → 2522.78] and at up two angles,
[2523.40 → 2524.52] it can already be unlocking
[2524.52 → 2525.60] before it's even right directly in front of you?
[2525.60 → 2526.70] Well, they had it sitting on the desk.
[2526.82 → 2528.22] Like, they were simulating the
[2528.22 → 2528.70] you know,
[2528.78 → 2531.02] I'm being a rude jackass
[2531.02 → 2532.82] at dinner experience
[2532.82 → 2535.26] where it was sitting on the desk right there,
[2535.30 → 2535.32] and you were near it.
[2535.32 → 2536.36] I better read the spicy one.
[2536.98 → 2537.44] No, no.
[2537.50 → 2539.30] This is the lame-o stuff.
[2539.42 → 2541.70] I've done the spicy one on stream before.
[2542.14 → 2543.02] I've had enough.
[2544.00 → 2545.16] Not today.
[2545.36 → 2546.34] Today's been a long week.
[2546.40 → 2547.16] I'll do it again.
[2547.64 → 2548.70] But, you know,
[2548.98 → 2551.14] I just don't feel like it today.
[2552.26 → 2552.70] So,
[2553.26 → 2554.36] iPhone X.
[2554.76 → 2556.10] What is there to say, really?
[2556.10 → 2558.72] I think one last comment is that
[2558.72 → 2560.44] the bezel-less-ness
[2560.44 → 2563.24] of this Samsung Galaxy S8
[2563.24 → 2564.94] is way better.
[2565.42 → 2566.10] What do you think?
[2567.16 → 2568.68] Having not held a 10.
[2568.80 → 2569.84] Having not held a 10.
[2570.80 → 2572.24] It's not bezel-less.
[2572.32 → 2573.36] It's just as thin bezels.
[2574.88 → 2575.64] I agree.
[2576.70 → 2577.78] With that said,
[2578.18 → 2580.10] there are times when the infinity edge
[2580.10 → 2581.98] does interfere with me reaching across the screen.
[2582.14 → 2583.26] I do have pretty small hands.
[2583.68 → 2585.12] But on the S8 in particular,
[2585.12 → 2587.96] it's not nearly as bad as it is for me on the Note 8.
[2588.72 → 2590.72] And I can pretty much work with it.
[2591.26 → 2593.36] I love the idea of the S8.
[2593.46 → 2595.06] I haven't touched an iPhone X yet,
[2595.22 → 2596.84] but I really like this phone.
[2596.88 → 2599.12] You can imagine a screen that looks like that
[2599.12 → 2601.60] and is curved and bezel-less like that.
[2601.82 → 2602.00] Yeah.
[2602.34 → 2605.44] But the curved edge actually doesn't register touch at all.
[2605.90 → 2606.10] Yeah.
[2606.18 → 2608.68] Like, what if there was a not visible,
[2608.92 → 2609.92] but haptic bezel?
[2610.32 → 2611.06] A haptic bezel.
[2611.16 → 2611.78] A haptic bezel.
[2611.78 → 2612.22] You know what I mean?
[2612.40 → 2613.54] Probably a matter of time.
[2613.62 → 2615.30] I mean, as soon as Apple sees someone else
[2615.30 → 2617.32] build some stupid weird squeeze engine,
[2617.52 → 2618.46] they're probably thinking,
[2618.56 → 2621.12] wow, that's like almost smart.
[2621.18 → 2623.88] Except if they'd done it with force touch or 3D touch,
[2623.94 → 2624.82] then it would be way better.
[2625.26 → 2625.52] Oink.
[2625.66 → 2625.98] Boo yah.
[2626.76 → 2627.82] I'm really surprised.
[2627.82 → 2630.00] I thought the X was going to be a knock off of the edge,
[2630.10 → 2632.12] but maybe that was too far for Apple,
[2632.22 → 2632.94] for even Apple.
[2633.14 → 2633.56] What do you think?
[2634.40 → 2634.76] Hmm.
[2636.76 → 2638.34] No, I wouldn't have expected that.
[2639.18 → 2641.52] I, I, I, honestly,
[2641.64 → 2642.94] nothing about it really surprised me.
[2643.02 → 2645.34] The only thing that surprised and or disappointed me
[2645.34 → 2646.56] was that we didn't end up
[2646.56 → 2649.54] with a Touch ID sensor under the screen.
[2649.64 → 2651.06] Because if it had Face ID
[2651.06 → 2653.06] and Touch ID through the screen.
[2653.76 → 2655.58] But is it because they failed to do it properly?
[2655.76 → 2656.44] That's the rumour.
[2656.44 → 2656.76] Yeah.
[2657.18 → 2658.16] Here's another question for you.
[2658.80 → 2662.30] Samsung is a bottleneck on their kick-ass OLED displays.
[2662.46 → 2662.64] Mm-hmm.
[2663.12 → 2664.84] Samsung is making their displays.
[2665.30 → 2666.46] I'm sure Apple claims to,
[2666.86 → 2667.58] I'm sure in the keynote,
[2667.70 → 2669.06] they said that this is the best display
[2669.06 → 2670.18] you can get on a phone.
[2670.78 → 2672.08] Is it the case that Samsung
[2672.08 → 2673.98] also has those exact displays?
[2674.10 → 2677.28] Or is there like an exclusivity clause
[2677.28 → 2678.96] that Apple has the rights to that display,
[2679.02 → 2680.30] even though Samsung's the one making it?
[2680.60 → 2681.46] Funny you bring that up.
[2681.58 → 2683.30] The issue with Samsung's displays,
[2683.44 → 2685.20] the thing that makes them not as good as Apple's,
[2685.20 → 2688.96] is that Samsung intentionally craps all over them.
[2689.28 → 2690.18] That's the issue.
[2690.38 → 2692.16] You mean to get other gains?
[2692.80 → 2694.66] Like they sacrifice something for something else?
[2694.72 → 2697.06] Well, they go full Best Buy,
[2697.06 → 2703.44] crank the vividness mode on it.
[2703.44 → 2706.16] And it's something that I just,
[2706.28 → 2708.86] I don't think there's any way they're going to stop doing it.
[2709.08 → 2711.06] Is that an Asian sensibility versus American sensibility?
[2711.06 → 2714.18] I don't know.
[2714.84 → 2716.30] It's a hard thing to,
[2716.38 → 2717.80] it's a hard thing to say,
[2717.88 → 2721.44] because especially given how much research
[2721.44 → 2723.30] all of these multinationals do
[2723.30 → 2727.00] on the localization of a product for a given region,
[2727.32 → 2729.88] I would have to think that if it was something that,
[2729.88 → 2731.24] you know,
[2731.64 → 2734.74] Americans liked to have colour accurate displays,
[2734.74 → 2737.36] I would have to imagine that other phone makers
[2737.36 → 2739.24] would also tune the displays differently
[2739.24 → 2740.06] for different regions.
[2741.42 → 2742.82] Okay, so this is interesting.
[2742.98 → 2744.12] Apparently Craig for,
[2744.30 → 2746.98] sorry,
[2747.94 → 2749.36] apparently Craig Fabergé
[2749.36 → 2750.50] did
[2750.50 → 2753.24] go on the record with TechCrunch
[2753.24 → 2755.80] answering some burning questions about Face ID.
[2755.80 → 2757.52] So I don't have time to read the whole thing,
[2757.52 → 2760.92] but basically Apple does not even have a way
[2760.92 → 2763.46] to give your Face ID to law enforcement.
[2763.74 → 2765.04] They never take possession of the data,
[2765.22 → 2766.28] anonymized or otherwise.
[2767.10 → 2768.38] It's all in the secure enclave,
[2768.74 → 2770.06] et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[2770.12 → 2770.94] Is it local?
[2771.44 → 2772.58] Yep, yep, yep.
[2775.88 → 2776.46] Nick's here.
[2777.14 → 2779.20] They've discussed a two-factor authentication
[2779.20 → 2782.58] so that you could actually force the phone
[2782.58 → 2784.90] to require both Face ID and a PIN.
[2784.90 → 2787.40] You know when you burp up like a taste from earlier,
[2788.02 → 2790.06] I just basically had fire in my valve for a second,
[2790.24 → 2791.20] like lava just came up.
[2791.20 → 2792.50] Dragon, dragon style?
[2792.72 → 2793.60] Just like, just, just, just,
[2793.60 → 2794.70] just lava.
[2795.20 → 2796.64] Do you need me for something?
[2796.82 → 2797.66] I need you for like two minutes.
[2797.80 → 2798.94] Two minutes to take a picture?
[2799.08 → 2799.44] Wow.
[2799.74 → 2801.86] So this is only your second time on WAN Show
[2801.86 → 2803.42] and you're going to have to tackle a topic
[2803.42 → 2804.86] all on your own.
[2804.98 → 2805.98] Technically it's my third.
[2806.08 → 2807.70] Can you handle not screwing this up?
[2807.80 → 2808.18] Probably not.
[2808.58 → 2809.16] Probably not.
[2809.22 → 2811.06] Okay, you want to do the 1070 Ti?
[2811.72 → 2813.00] I'm pretty loose right now.
[2813.36 → 2813.72] All right.
[2813.72 → 2814.24] Let's do it.
[2814.24 → 2815.02] All right, hit it.
[2815.22 → 2816.86] Where's the where's the original article from?
[2819.00 → 2820.20] Dang it, James.
[2820.40 → 2821.00] Damn it, Bobby.
[2822.78 → 2823.82] Oh, well, okay.
[2823.90 → 2824.70] Yeah, tech power up.
[2824.78 → 2825.52] Dang it, James.
[2826.26 → 2826.68] Damn it.
[2828.48 → 2829.30] Damn it, Dale.
[2829.80 → 2830.04] Um.
[2830.70 → 2831.48] I just love it.
[2831.48 → 2835.36] I don't know if you guys think you're going to hear that,
[2835.40 → 2838.06] but Nick just did an awesome impression of the theme song to King of the Hill.
[2838.16 → 2839.42] Yeah, I don't know if we're allowed to play that.
[2839.52 → 2840.08] So it's just as well.
[2840.08 → 2843.72] Head over to YouTube and watch a 24-hour live stream of King of the Hill episodes.
[2843.94 → 2844.48] Worth it.
[2845.34 → 2846.40] Okay, we shouldn't be promoting it.
[2846.40 → 2848.12] Yeah, we're not promoting piracy.
[2848.24 → 2848.42] Okay.
[2848.78 → 2850.90] You are crossing so many lines, James.
[2850.98 → 2852.40] I am kicking you off the WAN show.
[2852.46 → 2854.40] No, actually, I need you to cover for me on the WAN show.
[2854.40 → 2856.00] So here's the original.
[2856.66 → 2857.48] Thank you, Linus.
[2857.60 → 2860.06] Original article there on tech power up.
[2860.36 → 2861.06] Okay, I'll be right back.
[2861.06 → 2869.18] So the basic deal is, the rumour has it that NVIDIA is working on a new release of probably
[2869.18 → 2872.86] my favourite graphics card, the GTX 1070.
[2873.80 → 2876.46] It really hits a price performance sweet spot.
[2877.02 → 2878.58] And there's going to be a new one coming out.
[2878.66 → 2882.30] We're not sure if they're going to call it 1070 Ti or Ti,
[2882.30 → 2885.98] or if it's just going to be an unnamed refresh because that's what they've done in the past.
[2886.48 → 2889.30] For example, they did a...
[2890.96 → 2892.12] Let me look at my notes.
[2893.16 → 2896.02] There's a refresh in the past where instead of changing the name,
[2896.68 → 2900.08] they just put on the branding on the box what the new specs are.
[2903.20 → 2907.48] So the 1080 and the 1060 both refresh without name changes.
[2908.66 → 2911.64] The GTX 1060 6 gigabyte, for example, is refreshed.
[2911.64 → 2914.64] So the reason that NVIDIA...
[2915.18 → 2917.04] I'm talking to nobody here, and it just feels awkward.
[2917.20 → 2919.64] The reason that they're going to do this refresh is because...
[2920.16 → 2921.10] You come sit with me.
[2922.00 → 2923.36] It's because of Vega.
[2923.48 → 2929.54] Because the new RX Vega cards sit right in between GTX 1070s and 1080s.
[2930.20 → 2933.04] And so since an NVIDIA can,
[2933.12 → 2936.24] they might as well just release a card that just sits right beside that Vega.
[2936.24 → 2937.78] Now we're so close.
[2938.12 → 2939.24] I feel like we should...
[2939.24 → 2939.46] Okay, yes.
[2940.02 → 2940.24] Ah!
[2940.64 → 2940.96] Ah!
[2942.20 → 2942.82] Linus, please.
[2942.92 → 2943.96] Things are getting weird on the WAN show.
[2944.62 → 2945.74] Oh, man.
[2945.86 → 2945.98] Okay.
[2945.98 → 2946.76] It's like that scene in Wayne's World.
[2946.76 → 2949.24] When I go away for like literally two minutes and everything...
[2949.24 → 2951.24] Yeah, when Garth Stallone is out of Wayne's World...
[2951.76 → 2952.30] ...falls apart.
[2952.60 → 2955.50] The WAN show may not know that Linus hasn't really even seen Wayne's World.
[2955.54 → 2956.32] I've seen Wayne's World.
[2956.62 → 2957.44] But you don't care about it.
[2957.44 → 2958.42] I've seen it once.
[2958.42 → 2959.08] You can't quote it.
[2959.08 → 2960.08] A long time ago.
[2960.36 → 2961.22] Then you haven't seen it.
[2961.22 → 2962.68] I know something about party time.
[2962.76 → 2963.08] Excellent.
[2964.70 → 2966.80] A lot of the time when we're writing scripts,
[2967.34 → 2971.32] references that are shared between us are like the essence of the humour.
[2971.42 → 2973.80] Like the fact that we're both South Park fans comes up a lot.
[2974.10 → 2977.62] And I'm always going for Wayne's World references, and he doesn't get them.
[2977.72 → 2979.02] And it's just like, I just...
[2979.02 → 2980.50] Every time, I just melt.
[2981.60 → 2983.04] It's not that funny.
[2984.12 → 2989.30] It's basically an SNL skit stretched out for way too long.
[2989.30 → 2991.90] Like if I recall correctly, the plot is just inane.
[2992.06 → 2992.60] Please go.
[2993.70 → 2996.68] You're going to tell me you also like the cable guy, I bet.
[2997.18 → 2998.80] Uh, that one I haven't watched since childhood.
[2999.28 → 2999.62] Okay.
[3000.46 → 3005.24] As a child, when it came out, I literally walked out of that movie.
[3006.36 → 3007.90] Your parents said, where are you going?
[3008.02 → 3009.88] Well, I was watching it with my grandma, actually.
[3010.22 → 3010.76] She was sleeping.
[3010.88 → 3011.32] You just pee.
[3011.40 → 3012.62] Go to the arcade, grandma.
[3012.78 → 3013.08] See ya.
[3013.16 → 3013.78] It was...
[3013.78 → 3015.88] It was that bad.
[3015.88 → 3020.10] And I know that I'm probably taking some flack in Twitch chat right now.
[3020.26 → 3025.72] But Cable Guy was an awful, awful movie.
[3026.72 → 3027.24] Okay.
[3027.34 → 3030.54] But what about the scene where they're at that Medieval Times restaurant, and they're fighting
[3030.54 → 3032.78] and he's doing that Star Trek theme song?
[3035.48 → 3036.58] That's classic.
[3038.76 → 3039.28] No.
[3039.42 → 3039.82] Next topic.
[3039.82 → 3040.96] No, it was not funny.
[3041.28 → 3042.56] Not funny at all.
[3042.80 → 3043.16] Next topic.
[3043.16 → 3043.90] I don't know why.
[3043.98 → 3045.52] Why is everybody talking about Rick and Morty?
[3046.02 → 3047.88] Because it's probably saying it's better than South Park.
[3048.48 → 3050.38] It's not better than South Park.
[3050.60 → 3056.32] I mean, Rick and Morty has a couple episodes where I feel like they've made some sort of,
[3056.32 → 3061.80] like, some sort of social commentary approaching the depth of an average South Park episode.
[3062.16 → 3064.26] But maybe social commentary is not the forte.
[3064.72 → 3065.72] But maybe it's not.
[3065.80 → 3067.12] But I mean, how do you...
[3067.12 → 3068.28] So you're saying it's apples to oranges.
[3068.50 → 3070.64] I'm saying it's totally apples to oranges.
[3070.64 → 3073.20] I think they're compared because they have an overlapping fan base.
[3073.42 → 3076.42] Like, types of people who like South Park are the types of people who like Rick and Morty.
[3076.42 → 3079.60] Yeah, but I would say there are a lot of the types of people who like both of them that
[3079.60 → 3081.34] probably don't really get either of them.
[3081.74 → 3082.52] Ah, word.
[3083.58 → 3084.02] So...
[3084.02 → 3085.72] Are you mansplaining right now?
[3086.70 → 3088.48] No, I don't think so.
[3088.66 → 3089.18] I don't think...
[3089.18 → 3090.56] I'm not insulting Rick and Morty.
[3090.66 → 3093.40] I really like Rick and Morty.
[3094.36 → 3095.16] Rick and Morty.
[3095.22 → 3095.98] I like to watch it.
[3095.98 → 3098.10] No, I really like Rick and Morty.
[3098.16 → 3098.50] I just...
[3098.50 → 3101.52] I don't think it's comparable to South Park at all.
[3101.64 → 3105.04] I mean, the other thing, too, is it's basically in its infancy.
[3105.14 → 3109.08] I mean, if you go back and look at season one of South Park, season one of Rick and Morty
[3109.08 → 3110.12] kind of stomps all over it.
[3110.18 → 3112.86] Season one of South Park is mostly toilet humour.
[3112.86 → 3113.64] Shock humour, yeah.
[3113.76 → 3117.72] Whereas by the time they hit sort of season three to season...
[3117.72 → 3119.12] Six is golden age for sure.
[3119.24 → 3120.10] Yep, six, seven.
[3120.68 → 3124.62] I mean, that stuff started to get really, perfect.
[3125.32 → 3128.24] I mean, Rick and Morty's only on their third season right now.
[3128.44 → 3128.62] So...
[3128.62 → 3133.76] And I thought, honestly, I thought the last episode was probably the best one of the series
[3133.76 → 3134.40] so far.
[3134.54 → 3141.74] In terms of actually having a meaning that's deeper than, you know, I'm a silly scientist
[3141.74 → 3146.46] and I burp when I talk and, you know, scary stuff happens or whatever.
[3146.66 → 3148.96] I thought the episode with the...
[3148.96 → 3151.08] Citadel.
[3151.32 → 3154.36] I thought the episode sort of looking at life on the Citadel was fascinating.
[3154.36 → 3156.36] It kind of...
[3156.36 → 3162.24] You can kind of see that they weren't necessarily really expecting much in the way of continuity.
[3162.42 → 3166.40] That's also something that I think the show both embraces and suffers from.
[3166.40 → 3173.44] That they don't really care that much about the Citadel being explicitly described as the
[3173.44 → 3177.38] effort of a few thousand ricks the first time that we're introduced to it.
[3177.54 → 3183.96] And then being expanded a couple of seasons later to basically being an entire society of ricks
[3183.96 → 3187.48] and sorties that's, you know, had all these struggles for so long.
[3187.66 → 3188.34] Is this a spoiler?
[3188.84 → 3189.14] Oh.
[3190.58 → 3191.10] Oops.
[3191.88 → 3194.20] And have you realized or do you care that...
[3194.20 → 3196.46] Okay, no, I don't think anything I said is a spoiler.
[3197.00 → 3197.60] I won't...
[3197.60 → 3198.70] And I won't give you guys any spoilers.
[3198.86 → 3202.42] I mean, nothing that I've said will not be obvious within about the first 30 seconds of
[3202.42 → 3202.80] the episode.
[3202.98 → 3203.60] So you guys...
[3203.60 → 3204.24] You guys are all good.
[3205.52 → 3209.60] But in my opinion, it's the best episode of the show so far.
[3210.58 → 3211.36] Anyway, carry on.
[3211.66 → 3212.74] It's not Pickle Rick.
[3212.88 → 3214.34] Pickle Rick is just kind of goofy.
[3214.82 → 3218.96] Like, if you're into kind of silly humour, then Pickle Rick's a great episode.
[3219.12 → 3220.14] But it's one of my least favourite.
[3220.42 → 3223.32] So why don't you tell us why NVIDIA is refreshing the 1070?
[3223.32 → 3226.66] Why didn't you just tell people why they're refreshing the 1070?
[3226.86 → 3227.52] Yeah, pretty much.
[3227.64 → 3228.66] Just as a response to Vega.
[3228.80 → 3230.68] Do you think, though, that they're going to call it Ty or not?
[3231.52 → 3234.32] Um, I wouldn't be surprised if they don't.
[3235.32 → 3236.14] If they don't.
[3236.38 → 3236.58] Yeah.
[3236.74 → 3237.02] Yeah.
[3237.18 → 3237.92] I just...
[3237.92 → 3238.84] It might just be like...
[3238.84 → 3239.72] Because they...
[3239.72 → 3241.08] Yeah, because in the past they've done...
[3241.08 → 3241.84] They've done...
[3241.84 → 3242.58] It's something that...
[3242.58 → 3242.92] Same new refreshes.
[3243.00 → 3244.30] It's something I really don't like.
[3244.50 → 3246.06] It's something that I wish they wouldn't do.
[3247.24 → 3250.08] But again, we have Apple to blame for all of this crap.
[3250.08 → 3254.20] It all comes back to Apple just calling their product the same thing over and over again.
[3254.20 → 3254.70] Damn it, Apple!
[3257.50 → 3258.02] So...
[3258.02 → 3258.50] Yeah.
[3258.86 → 3259.40] I don't know.
[3259.40 → 3264.98] I think the idea here is it's going to smash or at least be the same performance as Vega,
[3265.30 → 3267.20] but just with a lower TDP.
[3267.90 → 3269.12] And a similar price point.
[3269.28 → 3270.18] So why wouldn't you get it?
[3270.32 → 3270.50] Yep.
[3270.84 → 3271.70] I think that...
[3271.70 → 3277.16] I think that NVIDIA could have easily just sat on their butts and done nothing about the Vega launch.
[3277.16 → 3280.04] Because at this point, they're pretty much just printing money.
[3281.48 → 3284.30] The R&D for Pascal is so paid for.
[3286.24 → 3288.36] But if they do something, then I mean, I guess great.
[3288.50 → 3290.14] I mean, that's what we want, right?
[3290.18 → 3293.22] We want competition to mean better graphics cards for all.
[3294.28 → 3294.66] All right.
[3294.80 → 3296.26] Let's talk about some more AMD news.
[3297.02 → 3300.48] Debater, the D-lidding king, is back.
[3300.60 → 3301.18] He's back!
[3301.52 → 3303.06] With more news.
[3303.08 → 3304.24] I got a little carried away there.
[3304.36 → 3305.82] I don't get.
[3305.82 → 3308.30] So this was posted on the forum by Watson.
[3308.72 → 3311.84] And the original article is actually a video.
[3312.02 → 3313.48] So let's go ahead and fire that up.
[3314.62 → 3315.12] Hey, Roman.
[3315.32 → 3316.02] There you are, bud.
[3316.70 → 3318.68] So he comes out, and he's like,
[3318.78 → 3326.46] Hey, AMD said that the two extra dies on Thread ripper were specifically dummies.
[3326.46 → 3338.32] And it turns out that they are not just silicon spacers, but they are disabled or at least non-functional Zeppelin dies that do contain transistors.
[3339.38 → 3340.32] What does it mean?
[3340.44 → 3341.82] Why would they lie about this?
[3341.82 → 3344.28] This is what I don't get.
[3345.48 → 3346.32] Well, okay.
[3346.50 → 3352.18] So some people are speculating that it could mean that in the future there may be a 32-core Thread ripper.
[3353.46 → 3358.68] Maybe they wanted to just delay that little rumour from coming out.
[3358.68 → 3363.94] But it's taken until someone delisted it for us to speculate on that.
[3364.82 → 3365.50] I could have speculated.
[3365.50 → 3365.74] Does that make sense?
[3365.88 → 3366.14] No.
[3366.58 → 3366.80] No.
[3367.66 → 3369.04] Well, then I'm as puzzled as you are.
[3369.34 → 3373.84] Like, I've heard speculation about that going back to Computer before Thread ripper even launched.
[3374.14 → 3374.46] Okay.
[3374.74 → 3377.68] And this is from people in the industry, which always leaks.
[3377.88 → 3380.38] So it always becomes something that's speculated outside the industry.
[3380.38 → 3383.00] Well, did they explicitly say that there were no transistors in there?
[3383.18 → 3383.38] Yeah.
[3383.38 → 3385.34] Maybe they just have a different definition of dummy than you do.
[3385.34 → 3386.56] Why wouldn't they just...
[3386.56 → 3388.84] No, they specifically said they were spacers.
[3389.68 → 3390.54] Well, they are spacers.
[3390.54 → 3392.06] And that they weren't failed dyes.
[3392.28 → 3397.70] But if we can see that they contain transistors, then...
[3398.64 → 3399.88] Okay.
[3400.32 → 3402.38] What we don't necessarily know...
[3402.38 → 3408.04] What we don't necessarily know is that they are exactly...
[3408.04 → 3410.88] So they did say no working transistors.
[3412.30 → 3413.70] So that could...
[3414.36 → 3414.64] No.
[3414.82 → 3415.32] You know what?
[3415.34 → 3415.60] No.
[3415.74 → 3416.56] There's no...
[3416.56 → 3418.40] I don't really think there's any way around this.
[3419.58 → 3424.40] As far as I can tell, these are...
[3424.40 → 3427.58] I don't know what they are.
[3428.30 → 3428.86] I just...
[3428.86 → 3433.14] What I don't understand is why they would come out and say something like that when they could have just said,
[3433.52 → 3436.00] Yeah, they're failed ones.
[3438.20 → 3438.60] Or they're...
[3438.60 → 3440.24] Well, you don't want the F word in your product launch.
[3440.24 → 3445.92] Yeah, but everyone talks about the process of binning.
[3445.92 → 3453.20] I think it's fairly well understood within the kind of enthusiast community that...
[3453.20 → 3454.42] Well, Intel already slammed...
[3454.42 → 3455.54] This happens.
[3455.74 → 3458.52] Intel already got to be smarmy by saying,
[3458.94 → 3459.98] Freadripper's glued together.
[3460.32 → 3461.36] So they could have said,
[3461.70 → 3463.58] It's just a bunch of failed chips glued together.
[3464.02 → 3465.78] Yeah, but Intel does the same thing.
[3465.78 → 3466.78] I mean, this is not...
[3466.78 → 3467.00] A little stab.
[3467.36 → 3471.12] Yeah, but it would come across really insincere.
[3471.26 → 3472.24] Completely meaningless.
[3472.36 → 3473.42] Because everybody does it.
[3474.08 → 3475.14] So are you confused?
[3475.24 → 3476.82] Or are you actually just kind of upset?
[3476.92 → 3477.68] Okay, so we've got...
[3477.68 → 3478.36] I'm just confused.
[3478.46 → 3479.24] Did they break your Chinese trust?
[3479.24 → 3481.06] Because here, we've got people saying...
[3481.06 → 3481.86] Carboy X says,
[3482.04 → 3483.04] If the cores were enabled,
[3483.20 → 3485.60] the CPU would have 6 or 8 channel memory also.
[3486.10 → 3486.80] No, it wouldn't.
[3486.94 → 3490.42] Because the socket and the motherboards wouldn't be wired up for it.
[3491.12 → 3494.20] Now, it's possible that AMD was...
[3494.20 → 3495.90] That what they were hoping to achieve
[3495.90 → 3498.90] was that nobody would run out and try to unlock cores.
[3499.76 → 3502.66] But then they couldn't possibly have thought
[3502.66 → 3505.06] that no one at any point
[3505.06 → 3506.92] was going to rip apart one of the dies
[3506.92 → 3508.42] once a Thread ripper failed.
[3508.42 → 3510.42] They couldn't possibly have thought that.
[3510.58 → 3512.76] Because it is really easy to tell.
[3513.16 → 3513.98] Like, you can see.
[3514.22 → 3515.76] It's visible to the naked eye.
[3516.24 → 3516.78] If you...
[3516.78 → 3520.26] Okay, if you look at the video of the 7700K that we...
[3520.26 → 3521.40] Or 6700K, whatever.
[3521.54 → 3524.50] The chip that fell out of the vice when Burke dropped it.
[3525.00 → 3525.78] It broke apart.
[3526.08 → 3527.42] You can clearly see...
[3528.78 → 3532.36] Like, the cache and the cores.
[3532.54 → 3534.08] It's visible to the naked eye
[3534.08 → 3536.18] that that's a CPU die
[3536.18 → 3538.40] once the top breaks off.
[3538.42 → 3539.30] You're looking at me,
[3539.40 → 3540.80] but all I can think of right now
[3540.80 → 3542.32] is that my stomach is a cauldron.
[3542.92 → 3545.50] They couldn't have possibly expected people
[3545.50 → 3547.30] to not look at it at some point.
[3548.42 → 3550.86] So, I don't know.
[3551.24 → 3554.76] This just seems super dumb and...
[3555.34 → 3557.18] It's up to us to get answers.
[3557.68 → 3559.54] Yeah, I mean, maybe they just didn't want...
[3559.54 → 3560.92] This is a good theory from...
[3560.92 → 3562.04] Also from Carboy X.
[3562.54 → 3565.40] Maybe they just didn't want people, you know,
[3565.86 → 3569.76] running Thread rippers and Epic Sockets or vice versa.
[3569.92 → 3573.24] Maybe they wanted to separate their consumer
[3573.24 → 3575.52] slash prosumer from their server.
[3575.92 → 3576.62] I don't know.
[3576.96 → 3577.46] I don't know.
[3577.58 → 3579.14] But I guess I'm over it.
[3579.20 → 3580.54] I just don't understand
[3580.54 → 3582.46] why they wouldn't be straightforward about this.
[3582.46 → 3584.92] Because they have nothing to gain
[3584.92 → 3587.82] and their credibility to lose.
[3588.20 → 3588.60] There.
[3589.60 → 3591.22] And there are a lot of times
[3591.22 → 3593.58] when you run into stuff like this in the industry
[3593.58 → 3594.76] where it just kind of goes,
[3595.12 → 3596.82] why would you deceive us about this?
[3597.22 → 3599.02] No one could possibly care
[3599.02 → 3600.44] that you were doing it this way.
[3600.44 → 3601.90] Like, the same way
[3601.90 → 3603.80] that everyone has made CPUs
[3603.80 → 3605.30] since basically the dawn of time.
[3605.58 → 3607.08] And by that I mean the last few decades
[3607.08 → 3608.76] because that's as long as we've had CPUs.
[3610.02 → 3610.98] Why not just say,
[3611.06 → 3611.86] yeah, we're doing it that way,
[3611.92 → 3612.86] same as usual.
[3613.44 → 3614.64] Unless you count the brain.
[3615.38 → 3615.64] What?
[3617.28 → 3618.88] Bluetooth has been hacked again.
[3619.08 → 3619.12] No!
[3619.32 → 3620.42] There's more interesting ones.
[3621.22 → 3621.48] Really?
[3621.48 → 3622.30] There's more interesting ones.
[3622.40 → 3622.64] Alright.
[3622.90 → 3624.32] Some attack vector, Linux.
[3624.96 → 3625.90] It's a scary hack though
[3625.90 → 3627.72] because your Bluetooth just has to be on
[3627.72 → 3628.58] and you can get hacked.
[3628.68 → 3630.34] iOS has been immune since 10.
[3630.92 → 3632.46] Google provided device manufacturers
[3632.46 → 3633.50] with a patch last month
[3633.50 → 3634.76] but it's up to them to push it.
[3635.42 → 3636.04] Was, was.
[3636.08 → 3638.06] Well, it's up to the likes of Samsung to push it.
[3638.08 → 3639.24] Yeah, apparently there are literally
[3639.24 → 3641.66] billions of devices that are compromised.
[3642.10 → 3643.00] Yeah, but they...
[3643.00 → 3644.98] This has been patched since July.
[3645.26 → 3647.10] So, well, on Windows.
[3647.78 → 3648.84] Okay, we're not talking about it.
[3648.84 → 3649.28] Yeah.
[3650.74 → 3651.54] Alright, fine.
[3651.58 → 3652.42] What else do you got for me?
[3653.98 → 3655.38] You want to talk about the Hyperloop?
[3655.62 → 3656.58] No, it's boring.
[3657.86 → 3659.80] Google offers free repairs
[3659.80 → 3661.76] to pixel owners affected by Hurricane Harvey.
[3661.92 → 3662.94] Now, this is the opposite
[3662.94 → 3663.78] of what we were just talking about.
[3663.78 → 3664.88] I see this being abused.
[3665.20 → 3666.70] This is an opportunity.
[3666.92 → 3667.92] This is low-hanging fruit.
[3668.02 → 3668.56] This is an opportunity
[3668.56 → 3669.42] for a company like Google
[3669.42 → 3670.94] to get some kick-ass PR
[3670.94 → 3672.54] during a very hard time
[3672.54 → 3673.34] for lots of Americans
[3673.34 → 3674.16] to say,
[3674.24 → 3674.80] you know what, guys?
[3675.16 → 3675.86] Free repairs.
[3676.32 → 3677.34] If your phone
[3677.34 → 3678.32] that's not as waterproof
[3678.32 → 3679.28] as some phones on the market
[3679.28 → 3679.88] gets damaged
[3679.88 → 3680.96] in this hurricane crisis,
[3681.20 → 3682.86] how many people
[3682.86 → 3683.94] are going to take them up on that?
[3684.28 → 3685.10] Not that many.
[3685.10 → 3687.68] So, that is some cheap, good PR.
[3688.22 → 3689.34] Yeah, we're talking about it.
[3690.34 → 3690.70] Okay.
[3691.32 → 3691.78] Alright.
[3692.84 → 3693.86] Cheap, good PR.
[3694.58 → 3696.46] Um, I don't know
[3696.46 → 3697.08] that this is going to be
[3697.08 → 3698.20] entirely good PR,
[3698.44 → 3699.98] but let's have a look
[3699.98 → 3701.54] at the Element 6.
[3705.44 → 3706.10] This is...
[3706.10 → 3706.52] I'm open.
[3706.84 → 3707.72] I'm willing to be convinced.
[3707.84 → 3710.30] ...the craziest case
[3710.30 → 3711.82] that I've ever seen.
[3711.82 → 3713.98] So, this is an appearance prototype.
[3713.98 → 3714.34] I'll concede that.
[3714.50 → 3715.58] Non-functional prototype
[3715.58 → 3716.92] that looks like
[3716.92 → 3717.72] the final product.
[3718.18 → 3719.02] Let's go ahead
[3719.02 → 3720.92] and skip back over here.
[3721.36 → 3723.50] Check this thing out.
[3724.18 → 3725.38] I guess I don't like
[3725.38 → 3726.26] that it looks like a car.
[3726.62 → 3728.20] But that's the idea!
[3728.70 → 3729.60] It doesn't look enough
[3729.60 → 3730.34] like a car, though.
[3730.38 → 3730.86] It looks like
[3730.86 → 3732.16] an abstraction of a car.
[3732.62 → 3733.42] No, no, no, no, no,
[3733.42 → 3734.46] because the finished one
[3734.46 → 3736.00] will be more like this.
[3737.92 → 3738.56] Like it has
[3738.56 → 3739.48] a little grill on it?
[3740.38 → 3740.82] Well, no.
[3740.82 → 3742.08] It's also got like cutouts
[3742.08 → 3743.26] for the windows
[3743.26 → 3744.08] and the windshield.
[3744.82 → 3745.46] Like basically,
[3745.76 → 3747.36] this is supposed to be
[3747.36 → 3749.44] like the case
[3749.44 → 3750.38] that's unlike
[3750.38 → 3752.24] any other case.
[3752.42 → 3753.56] They're trying to merge
[3753.56 → 3754.98] art and technology.
[3755.10 → 3755.36] Yes.
[3755.38 → 3756.14] They're making a case
[3756.14 → 3757.18] that's carbon fibre.
[3757.48 → 3757.88] Yes.
[3758.26 → 3759.98] That belongs on the desk
[3759.98 → 3761.30] of like the CEO.
[3761.76 → 3762.84] All of that is awesome.
[3763.34 → 3764.42] I just disagree
[3764.42 → 3765.72] with the form factor
[3765.72 → 3766.20] they chose
[3766.20 → 3767.74] being this particular
[3767.74 → 3768.24] car shape.
[3768.82 → 3769.64] Why does it want to look like
[3769.64 → 3770.58] a car?
[3771.82 → 3772.58] It should just look like
[3772.58 → 3774.62] some kind of weird form,
[3774.82 → 3775.70] if anything.
[3776.02 → 3776.84] You think so?
[3777.08 → 3777.90] Like a little
[3777.90 → 3779.06] carbon fibre blob
[3779.06 → 3779.38] or something.
[3779.76 → 3780.90] So there's kind of
[3780.90 → 3781.50] the best look
[3781.50 → 3782.38] that we have at
[3782.38 → 3783.80] what the finished finish
[3783.80 → 3784.58] will look like,
[3784.64 → 3785.08] what the girls
[3785.08 → 3785.64] will look like.
[3786.64 → 3787.78] This is done
[3787.78 → 3788.76] by the Singularity
[3788.76 → 3789.52] Computers guys.
[3789.64 → 3791.10] If it was anyone else,
[3791.52 → 3792.20] then I'd be like,
[3792.68 → 3793.60] yeah, that's dumb.
[3793.70 → 3794.04] Forget it.
[3794.20 → 3794.76] Are they in Australia?
[3794.76 → 3795.44] Yeah.
[3795.44 → 3795.68] Yeah.
[3797.52 → 3798.88] But these guys
[3798.88 → 3801.28] know gorgeous,
[3801.64 → 3804.10] gorgeous work
[3804.10 → 3805.58] and these guys,
[3805.78 → 3807.00] if there was anyone
[3807.00 → 3807.68] that I think
[3807.68 → 3808.88] would actually be able
[3808.88 → 3809.48] to build something
[3809.48 → 3810.10] like this
[3810.10 → 3811.72] and make it incredible,
[3812.10 → 3813.32] these guys would be it.
[3813.58 → 3814.42] Why is that?
[3814.92 → 3815.68] Just because
[3815.68 → 3816.18] they have
[3816.18 → 3817.46] a long history
[3817.46 → 3818.38] of just building
[3818.38 → 3820.46] amazing art pieces.
[3821.06 → 3821.60] They've only got
[3821.60 → 3822.50] two backers though.
[3822.58 → 3823.14] So it seems like
[3823.14 → 3824.14] most people agree
[3824.14 → 3824.74] with you
[3824.74 → 3825.54] or at least
[3825.54 → 3826.18] most people
[3826.18 → 3829.46] with $6,000
[3829.46 → 3831.26] That's what the pledge is?
[3831.30 → 3832.06] Is that the minimum pledge?
[3832.28 → 3833.28] That's not the minimum pledge
[3833.28 → 3834.24] but that's the minimum pledge
[3834.24 → 3835.48] to get a case.
[3836.38 → 3837.26] I did the math.
[3837.34 → 3837.78] They're looking for
[3837.78 → 3838.72] $148,000
[3838.72 → 3842.02] That will allow them
[3842.02 → 3843.78] to build 24 units
[3843.78 → 3844.20] so that's like
[3844.20 → 3845.14] $6,100 each.
[3846.72 → 3847.04] I mean,
[3847.12 → 3847.44] obviously
[3847.44 → 3848.92] they had to get
[3848.92 → 3849.40] the expertise
[3849.40 → 3849.98] they had to build
[3849.98 → 3850.50] the facility
[3850.50 → 3851.12] like there's
[3851.12 → 3852.46] people hours involved.
[3853.20 → 3854.20] But they already have.
[3854.24 → 3854.52] It's not like
[3854.52 → 3855.04] they're going to retail
[3855.04 → 3856.02] for $6,000 eventually.
[3856.66 → 3857.46] They just want to become
[3857.46 → 3858.06] a case manufacturer.
[3858.08 → 3858.96] This will never be retail.
[3859.56 → 3860.18] They're going to sell them
[3860.18 → 3860.62] on their site.
[3861.64 → 3862.00] Oh, are they?
[3862.34 → 3863.04] Didn't you read
[3863.04 → 3864.22] my comprehensive show notes?
[3864.72 → 3864.96] No.
[3866.18 → 3866.68] I'm going to let you
[3866.68 → 3867.30] in on a little secret.
[3867.42 → 3868.10] You're allowed to give me
[3868.10 → 3868.92] shit about them.
[3869.48 → 3869.74] Poo.
[3870.94 → 3871.30] Okay.
[3872.54 → 3873.10] Poo emoji
[3873.10 → 3874.24] about them.
[3877.56 → 3877.96] So,
[3878.36 → 3879.26] I don't know.
[3879.26 → 3881.42] I think it's cool.
[3882.14 → 3883.04] I don't...
[3883.04 → 3883.96] Okay.
[3884.14 → 3884.50] You know what?
[3884.50 → 3885.22] I actually don't have
[3885.22 → 3886.20] much of a defence for it.
[3886.66 → 3887.66] So, this was originally
[3887.66 → 3888.40] posted by
[3888.40 → 3889.90] North storm on the forum.
[3890.66 → 3891.60] I think it's cool.
[3891.68 → 3892.38] I think it's different.
[3892.84 → 3893.66] I think it's something
[3893.66 → 3894.12] different.
[3894.68 → 3895.04] Definitely.
[3895.72 → 3896.56] And I think that
[3896.56 → 3897.50] it's good for the industry
[3897.50 → 3898.42] to see things
[3898.42 → 3898.94] that are different
[3898.94 → 3899.94] and I hope it succeeds
[3899.94 → 3900.06] for that reason.
[3900.06 → 3901.04] I hope it succeeds too.
[3901.14 → 3901.44] There.
[3901.70 → 3902.02] I do.
[3902.88 → 3903.38] All right.
[3903.38 → 3904.08] This one,
[3904.16 → 3905.08] I'm not really sure
[3905.08 → 3905.32] what I want.
[3905.32 → 3906.28] I want this puppy
[3906.28 → 3907.28] on my desk tonight.
[3907.90 → 3908.64] This thing's sweet.
[3908.78 → 3909.54] This is...
[3909.54 → 3910.00] Another thing
[3910.00 → 3910.60] I want to watch.
[3911.82 → 3912.44] You want to watch?
[3912.88 → 3913.62] I like to watch.
[3914.00 → 3914.18] Oh.
[3914.54 → 3914.88] Ah.
[3915.70 → 3916.82] Philips Reddy's
[3916.82 → 3917.86] the curved
[3917.86 → 3919.16] ultra-wide
[3919.16 → 3921.16] 492 P8
[3921.16 → 3921.88] display.
[3922.70 → 3924.06] A 49-inch
[3924.06 → 3925.78] 32x9.
[3925.86 → 3926.44] So, to be clear,
[3926.64 → 3927.64] this is two of them.
[3927.72 → 3928.56] Stacked one on top
[3928.56 → 3928.88] of the other.
[3928.94 → 3929.74] Stacked one on top
[3929.74 → 3930.08] of the other
[3930.08 → 3932.22] because for some reason
[3932.22 → 3933.42] you would
[3933.42 → 3934.84] want to spend
[3934.84 → 3936.94] $2,200
[3936.94 → 3938.56] to have
[3938.56 → 3939.46] one bezel
[3939.46 → 3940.34] rather than
[3940.34 → 3941.56] a cross of bezels
[3941.56 → 3943.18] when you could have
[3943.18 → 3944.00] done it for a fraction
[3944.00 → 3944.70] of the cost
[3944.70 → 3946.04] by just having
[3946.04 → 3946.48] four displays.
[3946.48 → 3947.12] I'd rather put them
[3947.12 → 3947.82] side by side
[3947.82 → 3948.48] than have this
[3948.48 → 3948.94] kick it.
[3949.40 → 3949.72] No!
[3950.94 → 3951.90] Okay, as someone
[3951.90 → 3953.00] who's actually done
[3953.00 → 3953.92] ultra-wide affinity
[3953.92 → 3954.64] I can tell you
[3954.64 → 3955.20] the experience
[3955.20 → 3955.84] is not as good
[3955.84 → 3956.50] as you might think.
[3957.20 → 3958.40] It's like unpleasant.
[3958.76 → 3959.62] Looking up high
[3959.62 → 3961.02] although that's probably
[3961.02 → 3961.74] only the same height
[3961.74 → 3962.52] as the last
[3962.52 → 3963.30] tall monitor
[3963.30 → 3963.88] we looked at.
[3964.06 → 3964.76] Yeah, probably.
[3965.26 → 3965.90] But I don't like it.
[3965.94 → 3966.16] It's unpleasant.
[3967.10 → 3968.60] This thing is
[3968.60 → 3970.76] just bizarre.
[3971.46 → 3972.58] So, the original article
[3972.58 → 3973.64] is from a non-tech there.
[3974.54 → 3975.54] It's not quantum dot.
[3975.54 → 3976.94] There's no Free Sync 2.
[3977.08 → 3977.76] The refresh rate
[3977.76 → 3978.48] is unknown.
[3978.78 → 3979.72] It's about a grand
[3979.72 → 3981.20] and the resolution
[3981.20 → 3982.36] is, uh,
[3982.58 → 3983.28] oh, of course.
[3983.42 → 3984.14] Oh, no, there it is.
[3985.14 → 3986.64] 3840 by 1080.
[3986.82 → 3987.64] What were you about to say?
[3987.92 → 3988.88] I was about to say
[3988.88 → 3989.82] that, of course,
[3989.92 → 3990.54] the same guy
[3990.54 → 3991.14] who didn't put
[3991.14 → 3992.16] any of the specs
[3992.16 → 3992.98] of the new iPhones
[3992.98 → 3994.10] wouldn't put
[3994.10 → 3994.72] the resolution
[3994.72 → 3995.18] of a monitor
[3995.18 → 3995.60] but you did.
[3996.18 → 3997.02] 600 nits brightness
[3997.02 → 3997.76] is pretty high.
[3998.14 → 3999.20] 5,000 to 1 contrast
[3999.20 → 4000.04] I find kind of hard
[4000.04 → 4000.42] to believe
[4000.42 → 4001.04] unless it's a VA panel.
[4001.04 → 4002.22] That's what they always say.
[4002.40 → 4003.26] Our tests never have
[4003.26 → 4003.90] anything close to that.
[4004.26 → 4005.14] Maybe a VA panel.
[4005.92 → 4006.90] Um, set to launch
[4006.90 → 4007.84] in Q2 of 2018.
[4008.10 → 4009.02] We have already confirmed
[4009.02 → 4009.74] we are getting one.
[4010.28 → 4011.16] Well, all this is to say
[4011.16 → 4012.76] you missed a crucial piece here.
[4013.08 → 4014.12] So, we've seen
[4014.12 → 4014.78] a super ultra-ride
[4014.78 → 4015.98] already from Samsung
[4015.98 → 4017.04] that got announced.
[4017.50 → 4018.24] This is actually
[4018.24 → 4018.80] the same panel.
[4018.92 → 4019.64] Samsung is supplying
[4019.64 → 4020.70] the panel to Philips.
[4021.12 → 4021.38] Okay.
[4021.52 → 4022.12] It's just
[4022.12 → 4023.86] Samsung's is more gamers.
[4024.04 → 4025.42] Samsung's is 144 hertz.
[4025.76 → 4026.18] We don't know
[4026.18 → 4026.62] the refresh rate
[4026.62 → 4027.08] of this one yet.
[4027.42 → 4028.80] Samsung's is quantum dot
[4028.80 → 4029.38] and all these other
[4029.38 → 4030.18] expensive features.
[4030.32 → 4031.30] So, this is the value one.
[4031.42 → 4031.78] Exactly.
[4031.94 → 4032.90] So, if you're not a gamer
[4032.90 → 4033.64] if you just want to look
[4033.64 → 4034.44] at the stock market.
[4034.44 → 4035.62] For working school
[4035.62 → 4036.88] who needs
[4036.88 → 4039.28] 49 inches of display.
[4039.42 → 4039.62] Yeah.
[4039.72 → 4040.78] For your average Joe
[4040.78 → 4042.08] who still has a thousand bucks
[4042.08 → 4043.48] but not fifteen hundred bucks
[4043.48 → 4045.20] this is it.
[4045.64 → 4045.98] Alright.
[4046.20 → 4046.58] Fair enough.
[4047.70 → 4048.10] Alright.
[4048.38 → 4049.46] So, I think that pretty much
[4049.46 → 4050.38] does it for
[4050.38 → 4051.74] the WAN show for this week.
[4051.84 → 4052.96] Thanks guys for tuning in.
[4053.08 → 4053.64] Thanks James
[4053.64 → 4054.40] for coming on
[4054.40 → 4055.14] for the last time
[4055.14 → 4056.50] and we will see you guys
[4056.50 → 4057.16] again next week.
[4057.24 → 4057.94] Same bat time.
[4057.94 → 4059.52] Same bat channel.
[4061.50 → 4062.26] Can you at least
[4062.26 → 4063.14] go the rest of the show
[4063.14 → 4064.40] without dropping any F-bombs?
[4065.16 → 4066.28] Frank Fairly
[4066.28 → 4067.04] Fern Gully
[4067.04 → 4068.24] Fire Truck.
[4068.60 → 4069.20] Oh, by the way
[4069.20 → 4069.74] the calendar.
[4069.88 → 4070.52] We're making the calendar.
[4070.68 → 4071.30] Sexy time
[4071.30 → 4072.36] men of tech calendar.
[4072.64 → 4073.00] No.
[4073.20 → 4073.88] Come on.
[4077.32 → 4077.76] You
[4077.76 → 4080.06] crazy guy.
[4080.08 → 4081.10] That monitor's not coming out
[4081.10 → 4081.98] until next summer
[4081.98 → 4082.78] by the way.
[4082.98 → 4083.58] Next summer?
[4083.88 → 4084.08] Yeah.
[4084.20 → 4085.30] No, it's a Q2 2018.
[4085.44 → 4085.74] Oh, I know
[4085.74 → 4086.42] but we're getting one.
[4087.94 → 4088.82] Apparently the WAN show
[4088.82 → 4090.00] Twitch chat is terrible.
[4090.80 → 4092.58] I really don't know
[4092.58 → 4093.00] What does that mean?
[4093.06 → 4093.60] What do you mean by that?
[4093.66 → 4095.16] What this person was expecting.
[4095.32 → 4096.00] Oh, just someone posted
[4096.00 → 4096.52] on the forum
[4096.52 → 4097.76] the WAN show Twitch chat
[4097.76 → 4098.60] is terrible.
[4098.60 → 4099.32] About in what way?
[4099.82 → 4100.02] I don't know.
