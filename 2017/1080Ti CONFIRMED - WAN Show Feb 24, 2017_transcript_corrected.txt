[0.00 → 9.54] All right, welcome to the WAN show where we deploy new ways of streaming without actually
[9.54 → 16.34] going ahead and testing the aforementioned new ways of streaming, and we are back.
[16.94 → 25.06] So, since I have a badminton class tonight, and I am not going to have time to do a thing
[25.06 → 27.76] where I stitch together the footage, we're going to start over.
[27.76 → 29.24] So, this is John.
[29.56 → 29.82] Hi.
[30.00 → 30.88] John went to Duke.
[31.64 → 33.76] We have a lot of great topics for you today.
[34.76 → 35.58] What were they?
[35.68 → 36.44] Right, Disney.
[37.28 → 42.08] Disney, of all companies, nails free-roaming wireless power delivery.
[42.18 → 42.74] I mean, Disney?
[43.08 → 44.98] I can see a few ways they would actually use it.
[45.84 → 47.48] To make Star Wars.
[48.06 → 48.78] Well, other than that.
[48.80 → 50.60] With Star Wars technology.
[52.62 → 53.72] Actual lightsabres?
[53.72 → 59.66] The Switch will not have a virtual console at launch, which I guess actually makes a fair
[59.66 → 60.24] bit of sense.
[62.24 → 69.26] Microsoft is testing underwater data centres, and we're going to do a summary of AMD Ryzen
[69.26 → 71.58] for those three of you who haven't already heard about it.
[71.58 → 78.38] And finally, we are going to reveal a rumour that we can neither confirm nor deny, because it's
[78.38 → 78.94] just a rumour.
[79.30 → 81.56] The source of the rumour, we will explain later.
[82.04 → 90.18] But apparently, allegedly, a GTX 1080 Ti graphics card is set to launch next week.
[90.18 → 92.36] More at 11.
[93.72 → 94.98] And let's roll the intro.
[102.24 → 104.80] Everyone's like, shoe on head or pre-recorded?
[105.36 → 107.28] Joke's on you, I don't wear shoes.
[107.66 → 108.66] I wear sandals.
[109.78 → 110.54] And I'm wearing slippers.
[110.94 → 111.18] Yeah.
[111.18 → 112.34] We should do it.
[113.54 → 114.00] Okay, here.
[115.64 → 117.40] This video brought to you by Valid.
[118.12 → 119.18] And also...
[119.18 → 120.20] Okay.
[125.20 → 126.30] So there you have it.
[126.46 → 128.26] Our proof is entirely unsuitable.
[128.92 → 133.26] Neither of these are shoes, and therefore, this video is pre-recorded.
[133.36 → 133.56] Ha!
[133.82 → 134.30] Ha ha!
[135.18 → 136.74] Take that, Twitch chat.
[137.72 → 138.62] All right.
[139.12 → 140.24] Everyone's like, where's Luke?
[140.64 → 142.14] So actually, you know what?
[142.22 → 147.92] That would be a great first topic for us to jump into, because there is a thing that is
[147.92 → 154.96] not in the doc, so comments to at James underscore gravity for managing to miss the biggest news
[154.96 → 155.94] of the week.
[156.32 → 160.72] The very first thing we're going to talk about in our doc here, and that is the...
[160.72 → 161.60] What are they calling it?
[161.78 → 162.18] Cloud bleed?
[162.72 → 163.12] Yes.
[164.16 → 165.82] Kind of like Hartley, but cloud.
[165.94 → 166.12] Yeah.
[166.12 → 167.66] So here we go.
[167.74 → 169.24] The original article here.
[169.32 → 173.58] Actually, if you don't mind pulling it up, I'm having a bit of an issue with my laptops.
[175.10 → 175.78] Oh, hold on.
[175.94 → 176.62] That might solve it.
[177.08 → 177.24] Yep.
[178.04 → 179.14] Let's see if that works.
[181.64 → 182.04] FNF4.
[182.14 → 182.78] Very important.
[184.36 → 184.68] Okay.
[185.06 → 185.72] There we go.
[185.80 → 185.98] Okay.
[185.98 → 186.76] Oh, wait.
[186.82 → 187.48] Do you have cloud bleed up?
[188.60 → 189.38] I don't know.
[189.56 → 190.24] I don't think I do.
[190.38 → 191.04] I'm trying to.
[191.78 → 192.88] You got this.
[193.14 → 193.76] You got this.
[193.86 → 194.64] Just cloud bleed.
[194.70 → 197.40] Look at my incredible Bing skills.
[198.16 → 198.52] Wow.
[198.56 → 199.38] Why are you using Bing?
[199.46 → 200.30] Because I opened up.
[200.30 → 203.30] Why do you hate finding things, John?
[203.36 → 204.68] I'm kind of a masochist.
[205.40 → 205.76] Anyway.
[205.76 → 206.76] Okay.
[208.76 → 211.96] So cloud bleed is a big problem.
[212.40 → 217.40] It's like actually disastrous and pretty much in a nutshell.
[217.80 → 218.10] I got it.
[218.10 → 218.38] I got it.
[218.38 → 218.70] I got it.
[218.70 → 219.24] You got this?
[219.32 → 219.78] I got it.
[219.84 → 220.08] Okay.
[220.38 → 224.74] I don't have my notes on it, so I'm going to sound like an idiot for a second until I pull
[224.74 → 226.08] up our internal thing.
[226.26 → 232.58] So pretty much what's happening is if you've logged into any cloud flare protected site.
[232.74 → 233.68] And there's lots of those.
[233.68 → 238.16] Yeah, for those of you who aren't familiar with cloud flare, basically it's like a DDoS
[238.16 → 246.16] mitigation mechanism that websites, businesses, online services can use to make it more difficult
[246.16 → 248.06] for folks to DDoS them.
[248.06 → 255.06] So if you logged into any cloud flare protected site or submitted any other sensitive information
[255.06 → 261.76] between, and this is like a fairly significant date range, the 22nd of September 2016 and the
[261.76 → 266.24] 18th of February 2017, there is a chance.
[266.24 → 272.72] It's a very small chance, but there's a chance that your password or that sensitive data may
[272.72 → 274.72] have been leaked.
[274.72 → 281.68] The bug was most severe between the 13th and 18th of February of this year, but even so,
[281.68 → 283.78] the chance of your data have been leaked is very low.
[283.78 → 290.26] With that said, security, security, security, preventative security is better than reactionary
[290.26 → 291.26] security.
[291.26 → 296.80] And what you guys need to do is go check out some of the resources that exist right now
[296.80 → 302.90] about this and change and update the passwords for the sites and services that you use that
[302.90 → 305.38] have been affected immediately.
[306.38 → 308.24] Like, e-mediately.
[308.38 → 310.30] That's like the internet, but faster.
[311.58 → 312.10] Almost.
[312.50 → 312.82] Almost.
[313.02 → 313.22] Almost.
[313.44 → 321.50] Apparently this was reportedly caused by one incorrect character in I don't know how many lines
[321.50 → 321.88] of code.
[322.42 → 326.92] And what essentially happened was, my understanding is that it was a server memory dump.
[326.92 → 332.22] So, more knows what was in the server memory of all these websites at any given time.
[332.36 → 336.90] So, this is why you should probably be going and changing your passwords if you have used
[336.90 → 338.92] any of these affected services.
[339.30 → 346.04] So, even during the greatest period of impact, so February 13th to 18th, around one in every
[346.04 → 354.34] 3.3 million HTTP requests through Cloudflare potentially would have resulted in memory leakage.
[354.34 → 360.62] So, that's about .00003% of requests.
[361.42 → 370.24] But, with that in mind, even that tiny percentage is potentially a huge problem.
[370.88 → 382.16] And the reason for that is that even .00003% of the leaks from a mere 770 sites is 2.5 billion
[382.16 → 382.86] requests.
[382.86 → 384.88] Internet's a big place.
[384.88 → 385.18] Yeah.
[385.36 → 387.54] Internet's like huge.
[387.76 → 389.66] It's like they have more tubes.
[389.86 → 390.90] The most tubes.
[391.32 → 392.16] The biggest tubes.
[392.28 → 393.24] The biggest tubes.
[393.34 → 394.04] So many tubes.
[394.56 → 397.60] Like you can't even keep track of all the tubes it has.
[398.74 → 400.72] So, guys, go check it out.
[402.44 → 403.28] Let me just see.
[403.38 → 403.50] Yeah.
[403.56 → 405.62] There's a blog post over on Cloudflare.
[405.62 → 407.02] I'm going to post that in the forum.
[407.20 → 408.04] Or in the forum.
[408.14 → 409.42] I'm going to post that in the Twitch chat.
[409.64 → 411.26] So, you guys can go check that out.
[411.80 → 419.12] Make sure that you're not getting all your stuff ruined by having a bad day because people
[419.12 → 420.28] stole your information and whatnot.
[420.28 → 422.30] All right.
[422.30 → 424.74] Moving on.
[424.82 → 425.54] Shots fired.
[425.72 → 428.90] Google's Waymo sues Uber.
[429.56 → 432.20] So, the original article here is from Ars Technica.
[432.46 → 434.56] And you will have to pull it up if you don't mind.
[434.66 → 434.90] Oh, yeah.
[434.98 → 435.32] There it is.
[435.36 → 435.86] Look at that.
[436.08 → 436.80] Way to go.
[437.32 → 439.18] Luke screen share.
[439.18 → 444.24] Alleging that they stole trade secrets.
[444.48 → 452.02] So, Google names Anthony Lewandowski once one of its top engineers as the chief suspect
[452.02 → 452.90] in this case.
[453.00 → 457.38] Now, this is something that I've personally never really understood that well.
[457.38 → 467.20] Because while it's obvious that if you were to take, like, physical documents off of, let's
[467.20 → 474.26] say, you know, a fellow, a co-worker's desk and put them under your armpit or up your butt
[474.26 → 476.84] crack or wherever it is you decide to keep them.
[477.20 → 481.54] And you waddle yourself over to another job interview and kind of go.
[481.56 → 482.16] Just like that.
[482.28 → 482.44] Yeah.
[482.76 → 487.26] If you like my face, you should see what happens when I turn around and pull my pants down.
[488.16 → 493.66] You know, like, obviously, that would be considered corporate espionage.
[494.04 → 499.26] And in this case, what they're alleging is that he installed specialized software on his
[499.26 → 505.96] corporate laptop, loading it with 14,000 confidential files about LiDAR technology.
[506.46 → 509.94] And that while he was at Google, he was secretly plotting this whole thing.
[510.02 → 512.02] His next startup, Auto.
[512.54 → 516.68] So, then he left Googles in January, receiving a multi-million dollar severance, by the way.
[516.68 → 519.26] So, it was like, here are some millions, buckets.
[519.44 → 520.58] Here are some buckets of money.
[520.94 → 522.50] See you later, nice guy that we like.
[523.04 → 526.22] Then sold that startup in August.
[526.46 → 530.42] So, it was like eight months later for $680 million to Uber.
[531.58 → 536.00] Then a month later, Uber unveils its plans to bring self-driving cars to Pittsburgh.
[536.00 → 537.98] So, this looks pretty open and shut.
[537.98 → 544.66] But explain to me what the difference is between putting corporate documents on a USB key up
[544.66 → 551.96] your butthole and, you know, learning and developing as a person and as a professional and taking
[551.96 → 556.42] your job skills with you and the knowledge you gained to a new employer.
[556.42 → 556.98] Okay.
[557.14 → 558.56] So, full disclosure on this.
[558.70 → 558.80] Yeah.
[558.80 → 562.92] I had maybe three weeks of trade secret law in law school.
[563.00 → 563.70] But here's what I can tell you.
[563.76 → 565.64] So, there's possibly two issues.
[565.64 → 567.30] Was it the best three weeks of your life, though?
[567.88 → 569.46] It wasn't the worst three weeks of my life.
[569.66 → 570.06] Okay.
[570.40 → 570.94] I'll wish that.
[570.94 → 575.52] I had a good professor from the University of Kansas, actually.
[575.58 → 577.24] I saw we had a Jayhawks fan somewhere on the Twitter.
[577.52 → 578.54] Or not on Twitter, but Twitch chat.
[578.86 → 579.42] So, there you go.
[579.54 → 579.78] Anyway.
[580.30 → 581.48] So, a couple ways to look at this.
[581.66 → 584.24] So, the guy here was an ex-Google employee, yeah?
[584.44 → 584.70] Yes.
[585.20 → 589.04] One thing you can do, obviously, is when you hire someone, you can stick a confidentiality
[589.04 → 591.64] agreement in front of them, and you make them sign it as a condition of employment.
[591.82 → 593.94] And you can put in that confidentiality agreement.
[594.46 → 600.40] You can't do things like take sensitive dots, put them on USB drives, and jam them up your butthole.
[600.40 → 601.30] You can put that in a contract.
[601.64 → 603.14] So, obviously, you can go-
[603.14 → 605.92] I mean, it's probably okay to jam it up his butthole as long as he doesn't then give it
[605.92 → 606.64] to anyone else.
[606.94 → 607.30] Probably.
[607.46 → 607.66] Okay.
[607.76 → 607.92] Yeah.
[608.04 → 611.54] I would assume that their lawyers would be good enough to flush that particular detail
[611.54 → 611.86] out.
[612.10 → 612.72] But, anyhow.
[613.18 → 617.50] So, and, you know, obviously, this guy was obviously working on something very, very important.
[617.70 → 621.56] And Google is a major company with plenty of money to hire a good legal counsel.
[621.70 → 623.26] So, he probably did this.
[623.34 → 627.84] But even if that never happened, and they hired him off the street, which I'm sure was not the
[627.84 → 630.32] case, but let's say they did this and there was no confidentiality.
[630.32 → 632.42] They just told him, oh, you're hired.
[632.48 → 633.14] You started on Monday.
[633.62 → 639.28] Even so, trade secret law, my understanding is it could still begin because it has to
[639.28 → 639.94] be-
[639.94 → 646.90] If it's information that isn't publicly available and there's some sort of, like, possible real
[646.90 → 651.94] economic benefit or business benefit to that company, and they actually made efforts to
[651.94 → 652.54] protect it.
[652.64 → 656.24] Like, Google wasn't being all loose-goosey with this information, but they were actually
[656.24 → 657.06] trying to protect it.
[657.06 → 657.36] Okay.
[657.48 → 660.64] So, it's not like how to get to the bathroom on the second floor.
[660.76 → 660.98] Right.
[661.06 → 664.96] It's got to be something that's not publicly known and might have some sort of real economic
[664.96 → 665.32] value.
[665.44 → 670.20] So, as long as Google made reasonable efforts to protect that, then even if he had no
[670.20 → 674.12] agreement saying, you can't sell this stuff to competitors, then they could still go after
[674.12 → 674.58] him in court.
[674.96 → 675.28] Okay.
[675.52 → 677.42] So, if that's, oh, okay.
[677.60 → 678.60] Just, and I'm just curious.
[678.68 → 682.44] And again, I'm probably digging in a little bit deeper than your three weeks might have covered.
[682.44 → 685.22] Or your correspondence law degree or whatever it is.
[685.50 → 686.10] Oh, wow.
[686.10 → 686.76] No, I'm just kidding.
[686.94 → 690.48] Well, I did end up working here, so it's kind of what it feels like sometimes.
[693.06 → 695.42] Okay, but let me dig a little bit deeper.
[695.84 → 697.10] What if he didn't sell it?
[697.18 → 705.40] Now, in this case, you can make a pretty easy case for that he sold it because he went and
[705.40 → 709.88] started a company that clearly had this information and sold the company.
[709.88 → 712.14] But what if he just gave it?
[712.30 → 715.08] Is that a different type of offence?
[715.78 → 716.50] I don't know.
[716.78 → 719.98] As far as type, I'm not even sure how to characterize that.
[720.12 → 724.60] But at the same time, I'm almost completely certain you still can't do that.
[724.78 → 729.44] Obviously, I think there's some trade secret and some patent stuff going on here.
[729.48 → 731.10] I'm not sure if they had a patent on any of this stuff or not.
[731.66 → 733.88] But let's say there was a patent there.
[734.36 → 738.82] A patent actually excludes other people even from making your invention for a set period of
[738.82 → 739.04] time.
[739.04 → 741.72] But some things are notoriously difficult to patent.
[741.72 → 742.06] They are.
[742.24 → 747.60] But the other part of that was this stuff looks more like trade secret than patent, right?
[747.72 → 750.46] Because patents are publicly available.
[750.66 → 753.06] You can go, and you can look at them, but you just can't make it or sell it.
[753.52 → 763.06] So to answer your question, I don't think the fact that if he didn't sell this stuff,
[763.20 → 765.14] I don't think that would just completely get him off the hook.
[765.14 → 765.42] Right.
[765.64 → 770.66] And in this case, I think it was Phishing in Twitch chat pointed out that we're talking
[770.66 → 771.72] hypotheticals here.
[771.84 → 777.52] Google is a smart and together enough company that I pretty much guarantee you every person
[777.52 → 781.68] who sets foot through that door has signed a piece of paper that says something about
[781.68 → 786.06] how you don't steal their stuff, let alone high ranking engineers.
[786.36 → 787.18] So we get that.
[787.36 → 792.68] But Phishing also pointed out that usually some kind of...
[793.96 → 794.36] Wow.
[794.56 → 794.94] Why?
[794.94 → 796.26] The word has escaped me.
[796.32 → 798.22] It has been actually a very long week, folks.
[798.92 → 800.32] The severance package.
[801.02 → 804.24] That would usually be accompanied by some kind of agreement as well.
[804.82 → 806.96] Like, here are some buckets of money.
[807.36 → 811.02] You can't do these things for X amount of time after you leave.
[811.10 → 812.16] That would be fairly typical.
[812.56 → 816.28] So we're pretty sure Google has their butts covered here, and this is going to end up
[816.28 → 818.72] being a pretty uncomfortable situation.
[819.52 → 826.26] But the other sort of possible outcome of this is that he's got so many hundreds of millions
[826.26 → 830.64] of dollars that it could end up dragged out in court for a very, very long time.
[831.48 → 832.62] Nothing like lengthy litigation.
[832.90 → 837.86] So this is a quote from the suit that apparently he took, this is a quote,
[837.86 → 844.78] extraordinary efforts to raid Waymo's design server and then conceal his activities.
[845.36 → 850.88] And they are alleging that his web searches, downloads, and access to an external drive
[850.88 → 854.74] left digital footprints that they plan to use to bring this suit against him.
[854.74 → 859.10] And you can also certainly use that stuff to say, oh, this dude knew what he was doing
[859.10 → 860.98] was wrong, and that does not look good in court.
[861.40 → 863.28] So there you go.
[863.28 → 870.16] So the original article here is from forums.overclockers.uk, and I'm going to get John to bring it up.
[870.32 → 870.50] Okay.
[871.18 → 872.34] Do you have the dock open?
[872.54 → 874.46] I can't get to it on this laptop.
[874.66 → 875.64] You can't get to the dock?
[876.62 → 878.16] You can't get to the dock?
[878.24 → 878.70] No, it's fine.
[878.76 → 879.58] Just give me one second.
[879.78 → 881.20] We're going to do this, guys.
[881.24 → 881.86] It's going to be okay.
[882.62 → 884.34] We're going to do this the old-fashioned way.
[884.44 → 886.48] We're going to do this the iPhone one way.
[887.14 → 888.30] No copy-paste.
[889.04 → 889.74] You just...
[889.74 → 890.40] Just do it.
[890.48 → 890.92] Just do it.
[890.92 → 891.14] Hold on.
[891.14 → 891.74] If you want to get something...
[891.74 → 892.08] Here we go.
[892.22 → 892.92] Is this it?
[892.92 → 893.84] Do we have it?
[893.84 → 894.22] Do we have it?
[894.34 → 894.74] Do we have it?
[894.74 → 895.52] I think that's it.
[895.76 → 896.44] Hey, we got it.
[896.52 → 896.64] Okay.
[896.76 → 897.04] Okay.
[897.42 → 902.78] So first things first, I want to give you guys the AMD Ryzen summary, have a little bit
[902.78 → 909.30] of discussion here, and then we're going to talk about already, prior to launch, and I
[909.30 → 910.32] don't have mine yet.
[910.52 → 912.70] The pictures that I took were of one at the event.
[912.76 → 913.82] I didn't bring that with me.
[916.22 → 921.24] But we're going to talk about rumours already surfacing that there might be some issues.
[921.24 → 923.86] Dun, dun, dun.
[923.86 → 924.58] Dun, dun, dun.
[925.16 → 925.52] Okay.
[925.70 → 928.24] So step one of this is Ry zen's coming.
[928.70 → 928.94] Okay?
[929.34 → 931.16] I actually don't know if the...
[931.70 → 932.14] Yes.
[932.36 → 932.68] Okay.
[932.76 → 936.34] So it's for pre-order now, and the ship date is March 2nd.
[936.54 → 936.84] Okay?
[937.44 → 938.34] So Ry zen's coming.
[938.58 → 939.54] That's super exciting.
[939.80 → 941.60] We're all super amped up on that.
[942.00 → 946.32] There are three SKUs that they're announcing right now, all in the Ry zen 7 lineup.
[946.40 → 947.40] Have you looked into this much?
[947.50 → 948.38] A little bit.
[948.38 → 948.86] Okay.
[949.04 → 952.12] So there's the top of the line 1800X.
[952.36 → 956.54] That one is clocked at, I think it's 3.6 to 4 gigahertz.
[957.12 → 959.66] And it's an 8-core, 16-thread processor.
[959.82 → 966.08] There's the 1700X, which is 3.4 to 3.8, if I recall correctly.
[966.40 → 967.30] And then there's the...
[967.30 → 968.46] Did I say X that time?
[968.62 → 968.90] You did.
[969.00 → 969.22] Okay.
[969.38 → 971.52] Then there's the 1700 non-X.
[972.18 → 974.20] And that tall sounded like 3.7, I believe.
[974.38 → 974.60] Yeah.
[974.60 → 976.46] So that one's like 3 to 3.7.
[976.76 → 976.92] Yeah.
[977.22 → 982.62] They're priced anywhere from $499 down to $399 down to $329.
[982.62 → 991.66] So what's really cool about this is that AMD has taken 8 cores, 16 threads, and gone, you know what?
[993.00 → 995.36] This is worth $500 tops.
[995.82 → 1007.52] And you can have this for as little as Intel was asking for a 7700K, which is 4 cores, 16 threads, and onboard graphics.
[1007.52 → 1013.36] And we can discuss that a little bit later as well, actually.
[1014.18 → 1026.38] And, yeah, I mean, it's got support for DDR4, 24 PCIe lanes, which is smack in the middle of Intel's high-end platform and Intel's low-end platform, their mainstream platform.
[1027.56 → 1031.40] And performance looks really, really impressive.
[1031.40 → 1036.58] Now, to be clear, there are some things that apparently I misspoke on something.
[1036.70 → 1040.04] Obviously, when I was talking about the Intel chip, I meant 4 cores, 8 threads.
[1040.18 → 1040.40] Okay?
[1040.88 → 1041.28] Chill.
[1042.24 → 1045.68] I misspoke on something else recently, and people are like, who!
[1045.72 → 1047.12] Oh, everyone get their pitchforks out already.
[1047.34 → 1047.42] Yeah.
[1047.48 → 1047.62] Right.
[1047.72 → 1047.94] Anyway.
[1047.94 → 1052.22] So, you are actually making some trade-offs.
[1052.58 → 1062.78] Let's say that Ry zen's performance per clock, per core, was identical to Intel, Bradwell, or Skylike, or Kaby Lake, or whatever the case may be.
[1062.86 → 1067.50] I haven't personally tested it, so I can't break an embargo for information I don't have.
[1067.86 → 1070.06] Let's say, for example, it was identical.
[1070.76 → 1072.52] You are still making some trade-offs.
[1072.98 → 1074.60] Intel does have exclusive technologies.
[1075.04 → 1076.32] They have Thunderbolt 3.
[1076.32 → 1081.64] They have the upcoming Octane, which I don't know really a lot about.
[1081.78 → 1083.10] John has done a fair bit of research.
[1083.40 → 1084.82] Actually, you have done a fair bit of research.
[1084.96 → 1085.50] Do you want to talk about?
[1085.72 → 1086.72] Let's Octane, in a nutshell.
[1087.24 → 1093.82] TLDR, extremely fast SSDs, like quite a bit faster than PCI Express M.2.
[1094.46 → 1094.70] Okay.
[1094.94 → 1095.12] Yeah.
[1095.32 → 1095.46] Cool.
[1095.74 → 1097.24] Should we talk more about that?
[1097.32 → 1097.82] No, that's fine.
[1097.92 → 1098.10] Okay.
[1098.44 → 1100.28] So, Intel does have exclusive technologies.
[1100.28 → 1108.52] They do potentially have optimizations and functional units available in their CPUs that AMD might not have.
[1108.74 → 1111.56] So, a perfect example of that would be the onboard GPU.
[1111.56 → 1126.74] So, that GPU can do things like one of the demos that AMD has been running to show how more cores can benefit real users today has been gaming, playing Data 2 while streaming.
[1126.74 → 1139.82] And they've demonstrated that a 7700K gets absolutely butt-wrecked by that scenario, dropping something like 20% of the frames while the game streams.
[1140.06 → 1140.20] Yeah.
[1140.32 → 1141.16] Like, pretty significant.
[1141.34 → 1141.42] Yeah.
[1141.42 → 1142.54] Like, 15% to 20%.
[1142.54 → 1152.36] However, what AMD conveniently doesn't demonstrate is that you could stream using Intel Quick Sync video.
[1152.56 → 1152.82] Mm-hmm.
[1153.44 → 1157.60] In which case, you would be offloading that encoding task to the onboard GPU.
[1157.78 → 1166.62] Now, the argument AMD makes is that at the kinds of bitrates that you're able to use when you're streaming to Twitch, so typically around 3500 kilobits per second,
[1166.62 → 1183.26] you are, it is very important to have the cleanest possible source because any blocking or artifacts that exists in the original source at that kind of bitrate at 1080p60 or like 900p60,
[1183.26 → 1187.60] which is, again, fairly typical for Twitch, is exacerbated.
[1187.72 → 1195.18] It is made much worse by the low bitrate stream over Twitch's service.
[1195.18 → 1202.50] So, they make the argument that more cores is, in this case, more important than having that fixed-function video encoder.
[1203.30 → 1205.02] So, there you go.
[1205.26 → 1208.82] Basically, the fight that's coming is pretty interesting.
[1209.12 → 1212.78] AMD's saying, you know what, forget about it with some of this other stuff.
[1213.06 → 1216.16] We're going high-performance CPU.
[1216.40 → 1219.20] I mean, that was right on Dr. Seuss' deck.
[1219.96 → 1224.38] And Intel has taken a completely different strategy over the last few years.
[1224.38 → 1229.18] increasing their per-core performance and their core counts on the mainstream,
[1230.10 → 1237.92] basically not at all in several generations, and adding more and more GPU performance in that GPU.
[1239.00 → 1240.64] I forget where I was going with this.
[1240.70 → 1245.76] A little different from how it used to be almost opposite because you had AMD with the Apus,
[1245.76 → 1250.04] and then you had Intel, who was running circles around them in terms of things like IPC,
[1250.14 → 1253.36] and now it's now seemingly flipping a little bit with what they're focusing on.
[1253.48 → 1256.82] Now it looks very interesting where Intel is all of a sudden the APU company.
[1257.48 → 1263.08] With that said, I mean, when we showed Enough back at CES,
[1263.28 → 1267.74] I have to be really careful while I'm talking to not say things that are embargoed.
[1267.74 → 1272.12] So I'm trying to remember when I learned things and whether they're embargoed or not.
[1272.24 → 1274.14] So you'll remember this from CES.
[1274.82 → 1277.16] Apus are also coming to the AM4 platform.
[1277.54 → 1280.70] In fact, most AM4 boards have video outputs on the back,
[1280.82 → 1285.38] even though none of the Ry zen 7 CPUs have any onboard graphics.
[1285.46 → 1287.04] So those will just be dead ports in that case.
[1287.60 → 1291.74] Well, will they be, or are they integrating any kind of, you know, back in the day,
[1291.74 → 1295.14] they would somehow have little GPUs that's not directly on the motherboard.
[1295.26 → 1296.32] I'm guessing they're not doing this anymore.
[1296.42 → 1297.24] They're not doing that.
[1297.52 → 1303.04] It's either on the CPU, or APU as it were, or it is not in the computer.
[1303.82 → 1306.06] So that's kind of the summary.
[1306.52 → 1309.40] AMD and the demos look really impressive.
[1309.60 → 1311.86] There were more demos than what I showed in my video,
[1311.96 → 1313.44] and if you watch some other people's coverage,
[1313.60 → 1315.14] they might have focused on different demos.
[1315.46 → 1321.40] But I was incredibly impressed with the amount of progress that AMD has made
[1321.40 → 1325.94] over the last four years that Zen Core has been in development.
[1327.06 → 1330.76] Now, with that set, oh, you know what?
[1330.82 → 1331.72] Okay, no, no, no, no.
[1331.80 → 1333.50] A little bit, I want to straw pull this.
[1333.68 → 1334.46] I want to straw pull this.
[1334.56 → 1335.78] I want to get your take on this.
[1335.80 → 1335.92] Okay.
[1338.08 → 1340.78] And I'm going to straw pull it before I ask you,
[1340.86 → 1343.00] because someone has pointed out to me in the past
[1343.00 → 1348.04] that it is like a huge problem to issue a straw pull to the audience.
[1348.22 → 1350.46] And then say, oh, here's what we think, and then so it skews the pull.
[1350.46 → 1351.56] And say what we think first.
[1351.66 → 1352.00] Yeah, okay.
[1352.20 → 1359.60] So AMD Ryzen, does this mark a return to competition?
[1361.64 → 1362.04] Yes?
[1362.96 → 1363.38] No.
[1363.38 → 1365.36] How are we defining competition?
[1365.56 → 1368.18] Like a certain percentage of the market or a certain?
[1368.18 → 1374.90] I don't think we're going to try to define it in black and white necessarily.
[1375.26 → 1378.40] I just want to know, in the minds of the viewers,
[1378.98 → 1385.34] do you feel like we're getting back to a time when there is competition in the CPU market
[1385.34 → 1390.10] and where you don't feel like Intel is just doing whatever they want,
[1390.20 → 1392.72] as long as they want, or as short as they want,
[1392.72 → 1395.46] and we all just kind of have to suck it up, princess.
[1396.80 → 1401.64] So while the results roll in, why don't you go ahead and share your thoughts?
[1401.80 → 1406.76] So what do we know about performance levels, like single-threaded performance?
[1406.86 → 1411.50] Because I've heard rumours, and you have probably learned new information since I've heard this.
[1411.54 → 1412.62] I'm not sure how much you can say.
[1412.62 → 1417.96] But I've heard, oh, so it's going to be similar to what Intel had with Bradwell.
[1418.18 → 1420.80] And Bradwell is a couple generations old now by this point.
[1421.08 → 1424.30] But at the same time, if you look at how most users,
[1424.36 → 1427.80] and even a lot of enthusiasts, are using their rigs,
[1428.38 → 1433.26] they'd be hard-pressed to tell the difference between Bradwell and Kaby Lake in the day-to-day.
[1433.70 → 1438.14] Okay, so maybe assume, okay, AMD is not going to take a huge hit
[1438.14 → 1440.98] because users want more raw, single-threaded performance.
[1440.98 → 1441.98] Assume that doesn't happen.
[1441.98 → 1445.50] Yeah, so I looked the other night on Amazon,
[1445.94 → 1449.42] and Ry zen's already, like, number one-selling CPU.
[1449.54 → 1452.14] Now, granted, not everyone's going out and buying CPU in a box.
[1452.24 → 1455.18] The vast majority of people, they're buying pre-built, they're buying laptops, whatever.
[1455.46 → 1460.22] But nevertheless, it did make it up to, like, the top of the best-selling charts.
[1460.64 → 1465.90] Okay, so, and you're looking at, okay, so it's 2017 now,
[1465.94 → 1469.44] and we have more and more things that can take advantage of multiple cores,
[1469.52 → 1470.48] not everything, obviously.
[1470.48 → 1472.80] But it's a better situation than it was.
[1472.90 → 1474.24] It's a much better situation than it was.
[1474.24 → 1478.28] You know, four or five years ago when Intel said, look, six cores and more, that's enthusiasts.
[1478.72 → 1479.02] Exactly.
[1479.16 → 1483.38] So we're getting to the point now where, you know, those sorts of things that can leverage that stuff
[1483.38 → 1485.70] is becoming better optimized, it's become a little bit more mainstream,
[1485.70 → 1491.02] and you have a chip here that is eight cores and reportedly 16 threads.
[1491.12 → 1492.46] We kind of had a discussion about this earlier.
[1492.66 → 1497.92] Yes, eight cores, 16 threads, and this is, we're not talking bulldozer here.
[1498.26 → 1498.40] Yeah.
[1498.40 → 1504.42] Where AMD was like, yes, we have eight cores, but actually they have four compute modules
[1504.42 → 1505.70] which share some resources.
[1505.86 → 1506.94] These are eight cores.
[1507.08 → 1508.14] They showed die shots.
[1508.32 → 1508.92] There we go, yeah.
[1508.92 → 1509.78] These are eight cores.
[1509.94 → 1514.72] Okay, so we have eight actual independent cores that aren't sharing resources, as Linus just said.
[1514.72 → 1515.34] With SMT.
[1515.34 → 1520.78] And you have this, you can get a 3.7 gigahertz chip with this architecture,
[1520.92 → 1524.60] and yes, you miss out on some like, you know, the Intel platform exclusive features,
[1524.90 → 1529.92] but if we're just talking about performance here, $330 US as opposed to the equivalent chip
[1529.92 → 1532.58] is like, what, about $1,000 from Intel?
[1532.66 → 1537.50] So depending on how you measure it, and that's something that we have to be really careful as the press.
[1537.50 → 1538.04] That's true, yeah.
[1538.10 → 1541.08] And users have to be really careful about as well.
[1541.08 → 1550.20] We need to make sure that we understand that there are going to be situations where 7700K is going to kick a Ry zen 1700s butt.
[1550.58 → 1553.74] And there are also platform features that you would be getting with Intel.
[1553.90 → 1558.48] I mean, it's 40 to 24 as far as the PCI Express Line situation.
[1558.92 → 1559.68] Are my numbers right there?
[1559.68 → 1562.46] On the 7700K, it's 20 to 24.
[1562.48 → 1563.66] Oh, no, I'm not talking about the same.
[1563.72 → 1567.40] I'm talking about like, because the 7700K is not eight core.
[1567.40 → 1573.16] I'm talking about Intel's Skylike, or not Skylike, but a Bradwell E.
[1573.44 → 1573.52] Bradwell E, yes.
[1573.52 → 1573.84] Bradwell E.
[1573.92 → 1578.62] So in that case, again, so we have to be really careful when we compare to the 7700K,
[1578.90 → 1584.54] which has a much higher clock speed and will therefore deliver better performance in some applications
[1584.54 → 1589.42] that are really clock speed or like individual core performance dependent like some games.
[1589.64 → 1591.24] So we've got to be careful about that comparison.
[1591.24 → 1599.44] We can't say the 1700 is hands down better, even if it absolutely spanks it in content creation benchmarks, for example.
[1599.68 → 1606.50] And then we have to be really careful, again, saying, okay, the 1800X is equivalent to a 6900K.
[1606.96 → 1613.10] Because like John was saying, if you have, if heavy expansion is a priority for your system.
[1613.12 → 1614.08] Then they're not going to be equivalent.
[1614.22 → 1614.94] Then they're not equivalent.
[1615.06 → 1618.02] Because 24 PCIe lanes is not 40 PCIe lanes.
[1618.10 → 1620.08] 24 is clearly a lower number than 40.
[1620.08 → 1620.44] Yes.
[1620.74 → 1623.36] So AMD made a bet here.
[1623.64 → 1634.04] They put down their bet and they kind of went, we think that instead of taking Intel on head-on in the high-end desktop,
[1634.42 → 1639.90] so that's the architecture E, so HEAT is the 40 core platform, LGA 2011.
[1639.90 → 1654.28] And rather than taking Intel on head-on on their mainstream platform, we're going to go, we think consumers, enthusiast consumers, and consumers in general, want something kind of in between.
[1654.50 → 1657.78] Because it would have been more expensive to have more PCIe lanes.
[1658.16 → 1662.08] It would have been more expensive to have triple or quad-channel memory.
[1662.20 → 1663.56] AMD went dual-channel memory.
[1663.56 → 1669.76] But they did spend a little more than Intel because they went, and they threw more cores at the problem.
[1669.88 → 1672.98] So there's a more complex interconnect at play, obviously, here.
[1673.52 → 1675.80] So that was the bet that AMD made.
[1676.16 → 1682.78] And there are, I mean, you know, this is not a sales pitch for running out and buying a Kaby Lake processor, to be very clear.
[1683.10 → 1685.48] But there are other exclusive things on Intel as well.
[1685.66 → 1687.20] For example, Netflix at 4K.
[1687.20 → 1690.94] Yeah, you have to have Kaby Lake or Neural whenever their new chips come out.
[1691.20 → 1702.08] But, I mean, that's something that doesn't favour Intel necessarily even that much anyway because the high-end desktop, like the $1,000, $1,700 processor, they don't have that anyway.
[1702.28 → 1702.58] No way.
[1703.12 → 1704.88] So, okay.
[1705.00 → 1706.86] Let's bring up the results of the straw poll here.
[1707.06 → 1708.10] Actually, oh, you have to bring it up.
[1708.10 → 1710.24] It's hoppingly, okay.
[1710.42 → 1711.44] So here's what we're going to do.
[1711.44 → 1718.96] I have to actually type in the straw poll address here, so bear with me for just a moment while Linus cackles at me.
[1718.96 → 1721.24] I don't know what's wrong with my HDMI out.
[1721.42 → 1722.20] I'm sorry.
[1722.36 → 1723.08] One, two, four.
[1723.10 → 1723.94] I'm sorry, everybody.
[1725.14 → 1730.30] And I don't know why John doesn't get signed in to his thing at some point here while we're talking.
[1730.62 → 1732.72] I'm just trying to be expeditious.
[1732.82 → 1733.22] I don't know.
[1734.40 → 1734.84] Okay.
[1735.10 → 1735.64] There we go.
[1735.84 → 1736.04] Cool.
[1736.22 → 1738.18] 91% say yes.
[1739.36 → 1740.08] That's good.
[1740.08 → 1751.96] I mean, okay, to be clear, this is not the stock market, and consumer sentiment does not dictate how things are going necessarily to that kind of degree.
[1752.12 → 1763.58] I mean, but this kind of confidence is great to see and really encouraging, which brings us then finally back to that article that we were going to bring up before.
[1763.90 → 1769.38] Rumours are apparently already surfacing, and this is – I'm not trying to pick on AMD here.
[1769.38 → 1778.02] This always happens, whether it's an erratum or whether it's like, you know, some – oh, perfect example.
[1778.22 → 1784.08] Like, what kind of thermal interface material is getting used between the die and the integrated heat spreader?
[1784.30 → 1785.50] There's always some scandal.
[1785.60 → 1789.16] Every CPU launch, green or red team, there's a scandal.
[1789.16 → 1798.26] But it looks like Ry zen DDR4 memory might not be operating at the kinds of speeds that folks might have expected.
[1798.26 → 1809.00] So long story short, apparently Ry zen is having some issues running four sticks of RAM, especially while running high speeds of RAM.
[1809.40 → 1815.34] So it's recommended to only run RAM sticks at max of around 2400 megahertz if running with four sticks.
[1815.34 → 1820.00] However, it is possible to run two sticks with a max speed of 3200 megahertz.
[1820.18 → 1820.98] Mega – megahertz?
[1821.30 → 1822.10] Megahertz.
[1822.80 → 1831.68] Apparently this is all according to one forum post, though, and since we don't have a chip yet, we have absolutely no comments to make on this subject whatsoever,
[1832.10 → 1835.60] other than to say, yeah, that doesn't really surprise me.
[1835.78 → 1837.04] It may or may not be true.
[1837.04 → 1844.18] If you're having problems with your brand new Ry zen rig, you might want to try turning down your memory speeds just in case.
[1844.48 → 1845.24] So there you go.
[1845.36 → 1847.26] Just see if that helps you out a little bit there.
[1848.42 → 1849.02] All right.
[1850.40 → 1851.68] We've got –
[1851.68 → 1852.42] Disney's thing.
[1852.58 → 1853.46] What's coming up next?
[1853.62 → 1855.00] Oh, yeah, let's do Disney's thing.
[1855.00 → 1858.64] We were going to talk about that, and then we ran into some slight problems.
[1859.30 → 1859.86] All right.
[1859.94 → 1864.46] So the original – this was posted on the forum by – let's just go find out.
[1864.80 → 1865.18] Let's see.
[1865.28 → 1866.18] I don't know.
[1866.30 → 1866.82] I've got it here.
[1866.82 → 1867.74] I still don't know.
[1868.66 → 1869.78] By Hey Yo.
[1870.80 → 1871.16] Cool.
[1871.86 → 1874.78] And the original article here is from Mashable.
[1874.92 → 1875.82] Let's go ahead and pull that up for you guys.
[1875.82 → 1877.90] Oh, I actually have it up from ours, but –
[1877.90 → 1878.42] Oh, ours.
[1878.48 → 1878.92] Okay, that's fine.
[1878.92 → 1880.34] But it's basically the same thing.
[1880.42 → 1881.30] I love ours, too.
[1882.42 → 1888.16] Disney Research has achieved room scale, which is pretty freaking cool.
[1888.16 → 1890.36] Oh, let me just say still.
[1890.48 → 1890.86] There we go.
[1890.94 → 1891.42] It looks like that.
[1891.64 → 1895.34] Room scale ubiquitous wireless power delivery.
[1895.34 → 1899.86] Now, to be very clear, wireless power delivery has been a thing for a long time.
[1899.86 → 1910.40] But unless we go back to secrets that apparently died with Nikola Tesla, it's had some limitations.
[1910.40 → 1914.42] So some of the ways that they can do wireless power are with magnets.
[1914.42 → 1920.30] And that's where the induction charging that probably exists on your smartphone if you aren't an Apple user.
[1921.12 → 1922.30] That's where that comes from.
[1923.04 → 1923.26] Okay.
[1923.52 → 1925.64] Or if you are an Apple user, it might exist on your watch.
[1926.14 → 1926.38] Ah!
[1926.94 → 1927.36] Okay.
[1927.36 → 1928.94] So some of it involves magnets.
[1929.48 → 1932.60] So changing magnetic field causes something.
[1932.90 → 1934.00] It causes a current to flow.
[1934.10 → 1934.50] Thank you.
[1934.60 → 1934.90] Okay.
[1935.80 → 1937.68] Other options involve microwaves.
[1938.34 → 1944.58] So with, like, a beam, you can actually use microwaves to send power remotely.
[1944.58 → 1954.08] However, that is, while possible and actually, like, works, super hazardous.
[1954.68 → 1956.40] And, like, that's a big problem.
[1956.40 → 1957.56] Have you seen the videos?
[1958.38 → 1959.68] There was a channel.
[1959.76 → 1960.56] I forget the guy's name.
[1960.64 → 1962.82] But there was a channel of a guy from Ukraine, I think.
[1963.20 → 1966.58] And he took, like, the magnetron out of a microwave.
[1967.14 → 1971.62] And he stuck, like, a tin can on top of it and pointed it at a boom box.
[1971.64 → 1972.52] And the boom box exploded.
[1973.48 → 1973.84] Wow.
[1974.12 → 1974.36] Yeah.
[1974.54 → 1976.16] So some pretty serious stuff here.
[1976.28 → 1976.54] No, no.
[1976.54 → 1977.64] That wasn't what I was surprised by.
[1977.68 → 1979.64] I was surprised by you calling it Ukraine.
[1980.10 → 1981.66] You're usually the king of geography.
[1982.54 → 1983.50] It's Ukraine.
[1983.60 → 1985.08] Yeah, they took out the a long time ago.
[1985.36 → 1985.50] No!
[1985.72 → 1987.50] I beat John at something!
[1987.74 → 1992.62] Just because I use a slightly antiquated term for a country that's not even really incorrect.
[1992.90 → 1994.54] I got to take the victories I can get, okay?
[1994.60 → 1994.90] Okay.
[1995.04 → 1995.40] Very good.
[1995.48 → 1995.82] All right.
[1996.34 → 1999.30] So the concept here, this is really cool.
[1999.38 → 2001.02] This is, like, next level stuff.
[2001.02 → 2005.46] You walk into the room with a smartphone in your pocket, and it starts charging.
[2005.80 → 2006.04] Boom!
[2006.70 → 2013.58] So researchers actually built a freestanding living room with aluminum panels covering the walls, floor, and ceiling.
[2014.12 → 2018.56] In the centre of the room, a two-inch copper pipe runs vertically from floor to ceiling.
[2018.56 → 2025.68] Electric current runs down through the pipe into the floor and up the walls, looping it.
[2025.74 → 2026.18] Get this.
[2026.68 → 2029.76] 1.3 million times per second.
[2029.94 → 2030.94] 1.3 megahertz.
[2032.06 → 2036.70] Sounds less impressive when you put it in the context of, like, you know, CPUs.
[2036.70 → 2037.18] Yeah.
[2037.44 → 2037.62] Yeah.
[2037.62 → 2039.00] Except it's not the same kind of hertz.
[2039.08 → 2039.86] But trust me, it's a lot.
[2040.06 → 2040.48] It's a lot.
[2040.56 → 2041.06] And this is cool.
[2041.68 → 2049.20] The looping electricity creates a room-filling magnetic field running in a circular pattern perpendicular to the pole.
[2050.12 → 2053.38] So no humans can stand within 46 centimetres.
[2053.40 → 2055.22] That's about a foot and a half for our American viewers.
[2055.22 → 2055.42] Yeah.
[2055.86 → 2059.74] Of the copper pool because your body will absorb dangerous amounts of energy.
[2060.76 → 2071.08] But the researchers say it is safe to transmit 1.9 kilowatts of electricity, enough to power up to 320 USB-powered devices.
[2071.08 → 2074.40] I can see Pella's brain exploding.
[2075.08 → 2082.74] So Pella's, just to put this in the appropriate context, Pella's mom is a researcher on the effects of EMF on humans.
[2082.74 → 2089.68] And it is her belief that we are underestimating.
[2089.82 → 2091.54] And I'm putting this fairly mildly.
[2091.80 → 2099.04] But it is her belief that we are underestimating the effects of all the waves and bull crap that are going on around us.
[2099.86 → 2106.38] And I get the feeling that she probably wouldn't want to live on a block that has one of these on it.
[2106.86 → 2107.36] Do I get that?
[2107.42 → 2108.60] Did I get that right, Pella?
[2109.00 → 2109.70] He's nodding.
[2109.84 → 2110.14] He says yes.
[2110.14 → 2112.72] Would she want to live in a city that has one of these in it?
[2113.60 → 2115.36] I'm getting the head shake.
[2116.56 → 2135.14] Honestly, you know what's fascinating about this is that I think we're finally getting to the point where I'm right up there with the guys that are like,
[2135.14 → 2139.38] look, if you can't prove that it's causing a problem, it's probably fine.
[2139.76 → 2140.46] It's a magnet.
[2140.88 → 2143.06] We're surrounded by magnets and crap anyway.
[2143.30 → 2149.64] I mean, there's hippie morons out there that wear them because they think that it will channel their chi or whatever.
[2150.46 → 2151.48] They didn't die.
[2151.48 → 2153.54] So it's probably fine.
[2154.10 → 2156.34] Like, I usually kind of take that approach.
[2156.42 → 2156.84] Go ahead.
[2156.96 → 2160.86] Put an implant in my, you know, eye that helps me, you know, see better.
[2161.64 → 2169.64] There's never, to my knowledge, there's never been any study that actually suggests that things like EM interference is actually like hazardous or cancer causing or anything.
[2169.64 → 2173.82] I mean, yeah, if you get bombarded with gamma rays or something, that's a little bit different.
[2173.98 → 2175.48] But I'm talking about, you know, electronics.
[2175.94 → 2179.72] But this makes me a little uncomfortable.
[2180.74 → 2184.74] Well, just don't stand less than 1.5 feet from it.
[2184.80 → 2185.04] Right.
[2185.04 → 2193.88] But this 46 centimetre thing, like, it's not like, it's not like a microwave oven where we go, yeah, that stuff's dangerous.
[2194.06 → 2195.06] Yeah, like you shouldn't do this.
[2195.08 → 2197.72] You put your head in there, and it's a big problem, but it's okay.
[2197.88 → 2201.26] We put a Faraday cage around it where we have the Faraday cage.
[2201.38 → 2204.74] This is a well understood thing and it's fine.
[2206.14 → 2209.94] And here we're saying, yeah, it's fine.
[2210.28 → 2211.28] Don't get too close.
[2211.46 → 2212.66] How close is too close?
[2212.82 → 2213.82] Well, this, I guess.
[2213.82 → 2215.70] And you know what?
[2215.76 → 2217.38] I'm sure there's science to back this up.
[2217.50 → 2232.12] I'm sure it's, you know, and I'm sure Twitch chat is full of people raging at me because Disney has already demonstrated that beyond exactly 46 centimetres, you know, it fades away into the background radiation of which there is lots.
[2232.12 → 2232.52] I know.
[2234.10 → 2236.02] But it's like a foot and a half.
[2236.24 → 2236.88] It's dangerous.
[2237.02 → 2237.54] Beyond that.
[2237.66 → 2238.70] Don't worry about it.
[2238.90 → 2240.90] 1.9 kilowatts of electricity.
[2241.60 → 2242.56] Don't worry about it.
[2242.56 → 2246.62] I could see them refining this to the point where they'll deploy it at like their theme
[2246.62 → 2247.44] parks and stuff.
[2247.66 → 2251.26] And if it actually, you know, would cause a problem, there'd be so many lawsuits.
[2251.38 → 2253.74] So I feel like they would probably be pretty careful with it.
[2253.84 → 2269.26] So you think in the interest of protecting themselves from lawsuits, bearing in mind, of course, that, you know, lawsuits didn't result in the tobacco industry having to pay for, you know, the entire world's lung cancer treatments.
[2269.26 → 2273.30] Like, um, yes.
[2274.20 → 2279.70] With that in mind, do you think Disney is exposing themselves any more than, let's say, tobacco?
[2280.50 → 2281.62] Big tobacco did.
[2282.02 → 2282.24] Wow.
[2282.30 → 2283.68] It's like a law school exam question.
[2283.68 → 2287.70] Um, so what's your actual question?
[2287.80 → 2287.90] Okay.
[2287.90 → 2288.00] Okay.
[2288.12 → 2288.92] So you said.
[2289.12 → 2289.64] Flesh it out a little bit more.
[2289.70 → 2289.82] Sure.
[2289.92 → 2290.44] I'll flesh it out.
[2290.70 → 2304.20] So your, you say Disney would research it fully to avoid exposing themselves to potential lawsuits because people are walking around in their park and getting, you know, ass cancer.
[2304.34 → 2304.54] Yeah.
[2304.54 → 2306.18] Or whatever the case may be.
[2306.28 → 2312.38] I like how that's now the second, like, butt anatomy reference we've already made on Sancho.
[2312.46 → 2313.48] Oh, I can do more than that.
[2313.56 → 2314.24] Oh, I know.
[2314.38 → 2314.72] I know.
[2314.92 → 2316.28] You should see how many I can fit in there.
[2316.72 → 2318.36] I work with this guy 40 hours a week.
[2318.46 → 2319.40] So there you go.
[2319.52 → 2319.72] Anyway.
[2319.72 → 2319.82] Anyway.
[2323.62 → 2324.26] Sorry.
[2326.12 → 2326.76] Okay.
[2326.76 → 2336.98] But what I'm asking is, are they really exposing themselves any more than previous, what's it called?
[2337.06 → 2337.44] Precedent.
[2337.64 → 2343.80] Like, then we already have precedent for these companies not ultimately ending up being responsible for giving people cancer.
[2344.16 → 2348.86] I mean, okay, if they get to the point where, okay, we know this is safe.
[2348.86 → 2355.24] And the reason I even bring that out in the first place is because, oh, you know, if you go into, like, Disney World or something, they give you the little, they call them magic bands.
[2355.30 → 2355.90] You wear them here.
[2356.04 → 2357.46] It's got, like, an RF chip in it.
[2357.56 → 2365.30] And they're like, oh, you don't even have to carry your wallet around with you unless you want to buy alcohol or something because you can just do, you tap into everything, and it works, right?
[2365.42 → 2365.62] Right.
[2365.84 → 2375.28] So I can see them deploying wireless power in, like, let's say, a theme park to do something with those or to make their rides cooler so they don't have to run wires or something like that.
[2375.28 → 2384.74] But regardless of what they use it for, if they're going to do something like that, you know, if there's a real danger, they would obviously have to, like, disclose it.
[2384.80 → 2389.50] And they wouldn't do that because if they say, oh, by the way, if you walk into our parks, we're testing this new thing out.
[2389.62 → 2394.78] It's probably going to be pretty cool, but you also might get ball sack cancer or something.
[2394.82 → 2395.54] And that would be very bad.
[2395.54 → 2400.66] So even if they warn people, everyone's just going to be like, yeah, let's not go there.
[2400.66 → 2406.88] So, you know, I can't see them using this in, like, a very, you know, risky manner.
[2407.12 → 2407.36] Okay.
[2407.52 → 2418.90] So the basic argument being made here is that consumers were complicit in giving themselves cancer because by the time the dangers had been proven, there was a warning label on the box.
[2419.50 → 2422.10] And they're ultimately buying cancer, so that's their problem.
[2422.10 → 2434.76] Whereas if they walk into a theme park with the assumption that there's magic cell phone charging, not realizing that there's any danger, that Disney would be exposing themselves if they hadn't done appropriate due diligence at the very least.
[2434.76 → 2440.28] Yeah, it's called assumption of the risk, and it varies really wildly depending on exactly what situation you're talking about.
[2440.38 → 2445.58] I'm actually not down on my history because, you know, I was born in 87, and I'm not sure exactly.
[2445.58 → 2452.50] I'm not a smoker, so I don't know exactly when they started putting the warnings in all the cigarette boxes that said, you know, this might kill you.
[2452.80 → 2461.38] It was like how, you know, when they first invented Coca-Cola, they had cocaine in it back in, like, the 1910s or something, and they had no idea, like, how bad cocaine was for people.
[2461.66 → 2475.56] So I'm not exactly sure about that, but, like, at the same time, I think there is, you know, the average reasonable person, as we say in law, you know, if they walk into Disney World because they want to go meet Mickey Mouse and ride Space Mouse,
[2475.58 → 2478.94] you know, I think there's a reasonable expectation that that will not give me cancer.
[2480.28 → 2480.68] Right?
[2481.48 → 2482.16] There you go.
[2482.54 → 2483.76] Special cancer Mickey.
[2484.04 → 2490.70] Yeah, as opposed to inhaling smoke and lighting things on fire and inhaling smoke, which I think is just obviously inherently more dangerous.
[2491.08 → 2492.02] Than meeting Mickey.
[2492.16 → 2493.28] Unless you have, like, a...
[2493.28 → 2494.36] Depending on where you're meeting Mickey.
[2494.46 → 2499.58] Unless you have, like, a crippling psychological fear of, like, furries or something.
[2499.58 → 2505.48] If you're meeting Mickey in the back alley, that's probably inherently as dangerous as inhaling burning plants.
[2505.48 → 2507.84] That's really not safe.
[2508.02 → 2511.30] No meeting Mickey in the alleyways off of International Drive in Orlando.
[2511.46 → 2512.30] Please do not do that.
[2512.68 → 2513.36] Probably a good idea.
[2513.50 → 2515.46] So the original article here is from Kodak.
[2515.92 → 2521.66] The Switch will not have a virtual console at launch.
[2522.04 → 2523.72] And this is a statement from Nintendo.
[2524.12 → 2528.14] Virtual console games will not be available on Nintendo Switch at launch.
[2528.14 → 2530.42] We will share more information in the future.
[2531.36 → 2539.48] So virtual console, for those of you not familiar, is Nintendo's emulation service, which allows the Switch to play games from the NEW up through the Game Cube.
[2539.98 → 2543.52] It will likely become a major part...
[2543.52 → 2545.58] Here's the original article here from...
[2545.58 → 2546.10] Where is it from again?
[2546.10 → 2546.42] Kodak.
[2546.42 → 2546.78] Kodak, right.
[2547.24 → 2554.86] It will likely become a major part of the console's new paid-for online subscription, which will offer NEW and SNES games each month.
[2554.86 → 2566.24] The delay in virtual console support likely means we'll also be waiting longer for Nintendo's plans on whether discounts will be offered on games previously bought for other platforms.
[2566.54 → 2569.44] So this is kind of a bummer in a wide variety of different ways.
[2569.94 → 2579.02] So NEW and SNES games each month, does this mean they'll have a rotating selection of titles, and they'll only be available for so long, and then after that you can't play anymore?
[2579.14 → 2579.90] Or am I understanding that?
[2579.90 → 2583.04] I hate to say this, but I don't know.
[2583.28 → 2587.60] I think we've discussed this previously, and Luke knows the answer, but I'm sorry, I don't remember.
[2587.70 → 2589.88] I'm sure Twitch chat is going to pipe up and let you know anyway.
[2590.02 → 2590.52] I'll keep an eye on it.
[2591.00 → 2593.10] Basically, I understand what's going on here.
[2593.72 → 2602.66] This is an entirely new architecture, so it's not like Nintendo could just be like, oh, well, let's just take the emulation software we were already using and let's just run it on the Switch.
[2603.28 → 2604.14] Not that simple.
[2604.42 → 2606.50] This is a completely new device.
[2606.50 → 2625.96] So I get what happened there, but it's like super balls because Nintendo is doing their thing where, like, I don't even know why it made headlines that Nintendo was allowing you to carry virtual console purchases forward from Wii to Wii U.
[2625.96 → 2640.84] I mean, it half made headlines because of the ass-backwards way that they did it, where you, like, had to deactivate your Wii and then put it on your Wii U instead of just having it be account-based.
[2641.34 → 2650.62] Anyway, the point is now, I mean, we don't even know if we're going to get a discount on games we previously bought, let alone still have them and be able to carry them forward.
[2650.62 → 2658.60] And number two is that this even further damages the game library of the Switch.
[2659.26 → 2661.56] It doesn't even have a virtual console this time.
[2661.92 → 2669.86] And it's also funny because, let's say someone is waiting for the Switch, and maybe they're tired of their Wii, or they sold it or whatever, and they want to play an older game.
[2670.12 → 2670.92] Guess what they're going to do?
[2671.08 → 2674.42] They're going to probably, there's a chance that they'll pirate it.
[2674.42 → 2681.40] And this is a company that's extremely protective of its IP, so there might be more problems with that, which Nintendo was ultimately going to be very upset about.
[2681.80 → 2690.96] But because they didn't, they didn't simply find a way to either port virtual console over or at least say, okay, we're going to at least have something more available for you at launch.
[2691.30 → 2691.32] So.
[2692.88 → 2693.66] All right.
[2694.40 → 2695.92] That was pretty much it for that, wasn't it?
[2695.96 → 2696.10] Yeah.
[2696.22 → 2696.40] Yeah.
[2696.40 → 2697.00] Okay, cool.
[2697.00 → 2698.28] Let's move on to the next topic then.
[2699.76 → 2703.28] Microsoft is testing underwater data centres.
[2703.28 → 2707.98] So the original article here is from spectrum.ieee.org.
[2708.14 → 2714.26] And I know that the whole concept of underwater data centres is not necessarily the newest thing ever, but there's some new information.
[2714.40 → 2717.84] And this was originally posted on the forum by helpful member.
[2718.12 → 2719.66] Actually, I might be getting ahead of myself.
[2719.86 → 2722.16] It might be, oh, Aluminum Tech.
[2722.26 → 2723.20] Okay, yes, helpful member.
[2723.30 → 2723.76] Aluminum.
[2726.90 → 2729.20] So basically, there's some more information, new developments.
[2730.10 → 2733.16] In a nutshell, lower construction costs.
[2733.28 → 2735.38] Thanks to, oh, we haven't done our sponsors yet.
[2735.78 → 2736.76] Holy crap.
[2736.92 → 2737.98] Let's do our sponsors first.
[2737.98 → 2738.32] Let's not.
[2738.58 → 2739.10] FreshBooks.
[2740.34 → 2747.48] FreshBooks lets you, if you run a small business, or you're a contractor, or you are self-employed.
[2747.58 → 2748.08] Or a YouTuber.
[2748.52 → 2749.54] Or if you're a YouTuber.
[2749.88 → 2750.18] Actually.
[2750.18 → 2753.64] FreshBooks lets you get organized.
[2753.82 → 2754.78] Save time.
[2754.78 → 2757.04] And collect money faster.
[2757.30 → 2759.68] You can use it completely free for 30 days.
[2759.82 → 2762.96] But in a nutshell, what it lets you do is track your time.
[2763.40 → 2764.30] Track your expenses.
[2764.82 → 2767.94] Create and send professional invoices in seconds.
[2768.52 → 2773.56] And it gives you a lot more granular control over your business than you also might expect.
[2773.90 → 2779.04] So for example, once you send those invoices, you can set up like payment terms for them.
[2779.14 → 2783.18] So you could require the client to pay 10% up front as a down payment.
[2783.28 → 2784.86] Let's say you were a house painter, for example.
[2785.30 → 2787.34] Or let's say you were a technician.
[2787.52 → 2788.28] You kind of go, look.
[2789.28 → 2791.74] There's a diagnostic fee of $30.
[2792.16 → 2793.68] And then beyond that, it's hourly.
[2793.82 → 2794.64] So you can use FreshBooks.
[2794.72 → 2795.30] You can go, okay.
[2795.38 → 2795.56] Yep.
[2795.62 → 2796.20] Here's your bill.
[2796.28 → 2797.70] It's $30 down up front.
[2797.80 → 2800.62] And then the other stuff comes kind of after that as you continue to work.
[2801.22 → 2801.62] Awesome.
[2801.70 → 2802.22] Freaking cool.
[2802.22 → 2804.00] People can pay through the platform.
[2804.20 → 2808.96] And when you send out invoices, you can even see if your client has looked at it.
[2809.08 → 2812.10] So you can put an end to all those crappy guessing games.
[2812.10 → 2816.32] The mobile app also has all the functionality of their desktop version.
[2816.50 → 2821.12] So you can take FreshBooks with you wherever you go, like scanning receipts and all that good stuff.
[2821.36 → 2828.22] And if you have any questions or problems, you can reach out to their support staff where you will speak to a real human being.
[2828.48 → 2832.00] No phone tree, no escalations, no return calls, just answers.
[2832.42 → 2834.54] So head to freshbooks.com slash when.
[2834.72 → 2836.08] Claim your free trial today.
[2836.68 → 2837.24] Try it out.
[2837.24 → 2847.12] You have nothing to lose but the money you would pay for a subscription, which from the accounts we get from our viewers who have signed up for it, we've been advertising for FreshBooks for a long time.
[2847.52 → 2852.98] We've got a lot of people who have converted to the platform, are more than made up for by the efficiency savings.
[2852.98 → 2862.30] Epiphany, speaking of savings, Epiphany has basically saved the reliability of this show, which has been absolutely fantastic.
[2862.50 → 2864.46] We love their AVI-O video grabbers.
[2864.80 → 2867.96] They're portable, so they are just powered off USB 3.
[2868.18 → 2871.22] You just go plunk, laptop, desktop, whatever the case may be.
[2871.78 → 2875.14] And there's like no drivers, there's no configuration.
[2875.50 → 2879.02] You just plug in, video source, boom, you're capturing.
[2879.02 → 2886.50] So they're great for live production, like this, for example, gaming, lecture capture, collaborations, webcasting, blogging.
[2886.76 → 2890.36] One of the biggest things for me is the fact that they automatically detect the input resolution.
[2890.50 → 2896.78] This is something that has blown my mind that other capture stuff hasn't done automatically forever.
[2897.76 → 2901.04] Why make me manually select it?
[2901.26 → 2905.32] It doesn't make any sense, especially ones that I know have the hardware.
[2905.32 → 2908.48] There's just the makers like, yeah, that feature seems unnecessary.
[2908.70 → 2909.60] You should know what you're outputting.
[2909.62 → 2909.84] You know what?
[2909.86 → 2910.84] In some cases, you don't.
[2911.18 → 2918.74] Some cameras, you select 2997P, and you won't get a signal out of them until you select 5994i.
[2919.16 → 2919.92] Because that's...
[2919.92 → 2924.42] There doesn't seem to be a compelling reason for it.
[2924.46 → 2927.04] That seems like a lot of the rigmarole just to capture a video signal.
[2927.28 → 2927.66] Absolutely.
[2928.38 → 2930.62] And basically, Epiphany makes it easy.
[2930.62 → 2936.78] So the AVI-O line is available in SDI HD, so that's up to 1080p, and then 4K.
[2937.20 → 2939.08] So we've actually got all three of them.
[2939.16 → 2942.62] We've used them all on WAN Show for doing things like capturing...
[2943.18 → 2943.88] Gameplay footage.
[2944.18 → 2944.58] BIOSes.
[2945.18 → 2950.82] So let's say we were recording gameplay footage, and the computer blue-screened, rebooted into the BIOS.
[2950.90 → 2955.14] We had to adjust an overclock, and then we had to go back into Windows and launch the game again.
[2955.14 → 2960.96] Thanks to Epiphany, we can capture that entire process because it'll just switch input resolutions as we go,
[2961.12 → 2966.24] and we don't lose that valuable experience that we're having that we're trying to share with you guys in our videos.
[2966.42 → 2968.16] So absolutely loving it.
[2968.38 → 2972.50] Check them out at the link below, epiphan.com slash AVID slash WAN.
[2972.98 → 2973.94] We love these guys.
[2974.30 → 2977.42] Yes, they cost more than a cheapo capture card.
[2977.42 → 2978.42] But...
[2978.94 → 2979.52] Pay for what you get.
[2980.24 → 2987.28] They don't cost more than two cheapo capture cards, which is what you might end up buying if you don't just buy something good in the first place.
[2987.58 → 2989.12] I speak from experience.
[2990.82 → 2991.34] Yeah.
[2992.80 → 2993.78] All right.
[2996.90 → 2998.14] So this is interesting.
[2998.14 → 3007.24] Ars Technica reports that Amazon is refusing to hand over data on whether their Alexa overheard a murder.
[3007.42 → 3009.76] Dun, dun, dun.
[3009.78 → 3010.72] Dun, dun, dun.
[3011.22 → 3020.64] Amazon said that because of the constitutional concerns at issue, the authorities need to demonstrate a compelling need for the information
[3020.64 → 3026.46] and must exhaust other avenues to acquire that data.
[3026.92 → 3031.32] Even Alexa's answers are apparently protected by the First Amendment,
[3031.88 → 3037.00] which protects as speech the results produced by an internet search engine.
[3037.84 → 3040.32] So, wow, we've had so many legal topics today.
[3040.40 → 3041.00] This is great.
[3041.20 → 3041.42] Mm-hmm.
[3042.04 → 3042.78] Your thoughts?
[3042.88 → 3043.88] Because I don't know.
[3044.42 → 3046.40] Well, again, Amazon's a huge company.
[3046.54 → 3048.22] I'm sure they could afford some very good lawyers.
[3048.32 → 3055.40] But at the same time, I kind of raised my eyebrow a little bit because I'm not sure about, like, the First Amendment here.
[3055.40 → 3058.58] This sounds to me a lot more like Fourth Amendment search and seizure.
[3059.02 → 3070.06] The Fourth Amendment is the piece of our Constitution that says you can't search or see someone's property without a warrant, right?
[3070.34 → 3070.48] Yeah.
[3070.48 → 3072.76] So this seems to fall a lot more into that.
[3072.88 → 3076.34] You know, I'm not exactly sure how the First Amendment comes into play here.
[3076.44 → 3078.90] There's a quote from the court motion.
[3078.90 → 3081.24] There is a quote from the court motion.
[3081.30 → 3081.66] There we go.
[3081.66 → 3094.22] So I'm looking at that is alleging that this could have a chilling effect on speech from users, so folks who buy an Alexa or buy, like, what's the other product?
[3094.22 → 3096.20] Like, I'm drawing a blank right now.
[3096.24 → 3096.42] Echo.
[3096.74 → 3097.28] Yeah, the Echo.
[3097.66 → 3098.74] An Alexa or an Echo.
[3099.30 → 3105.66] From exercising their First Amendment rights to seek and receive information and expressive content in the privacy of their own home.
[3105.66 → 3108.26] Okay, so there is, like, a little bit of a concern there.
[3108.36 → 3122.54] But the more immediate one seems to be whether they can actually be compelled to turn the information over, which, like I said, I feel like there's some other concerns, maybe like a search and seizure that we brought up here.
[3122.54 → 3127.12] Because it's a local police department in Arkansas that's actually asking for the data.
[3127.42 → 3129.08] Bentonville, that's where Walmart is headquartered.
[3129.12 → 3129.36] Right.
[3129.42 → 3130.56] So, fun fact.
[3130.62 → 3131.28] Of course you know that.
[3132.24 → 3133.46] But, yeah.
[3133.46 → 3133.64] All right.
[3133.64 → 3140.02] So I'm not entirely sure about that, but it did make me raise my eyebrow a little bit.
[3140.08 → 3150.22] I'm also just intrigued, like, if Alexa did, in fact, hear a murder or was present for a murder, like, what exactly is being stored on their servers, like what Amazon actually knows about it.
[3150.22 → 3168.14] Yeah, I mean, at a certain point, I have to kind of, like, you know, for myself, I have to kind of wonder whether there's a line between sort of legal obligation and just sort of moral obligation in this case.
[3168.26 → 3175.02] Like, I personally, as someone who was murdered, would appreciate Amazon kind of, you know, helping me out on this.
[3175.08 → 3177.04] I don't know why my HDMI output isn't working.
[3177.04 → 3179.20] Well, I mean, at the end of the day, this – I got you.
[3179.34 → 3179.70] I got you.
[3180.18 → 3186.24] At the end of the day, this kind of comes back down to, obviously, Amazon's business, right?
[3186.30 → 3199.54] Because if this gets out, and it's like, oh, well, you know, the cops were able to get their hands on what my smart speaker from Amazon heard, then they may not buy smart speakers anymore.
[3199.66 → 3200.18] So there you go.
[3200.80 → 3201.12] Right.
[3201.64 → 3202.32] Fair enough.
[3202.94 → 3203.28] Okay.
[3203.50 → 3204.70] I could have done that, you know.
[3204.70 → 3206.62] This is amaze balls.
[3207.68 → 3210.62] The article here is from the Washington Post.
[3211.18 → 3214.12] And you guys have to check this out.
[3216.38 → 3217.82] Is this just a slideshow?
[3218.40 → 3219.18] It's pretty cool, though.
[3219.32 → 3220.14] Or it's a video.
[3220.36 → 3221.24] I hope I don't get in too much trouble.
[3221.24 → 3224.62] But France is apparently training eagles.
[3225.02 → 3226.88] And I hope we don't – yeah, there we go.
[3226.88 → 3227.36] You can tell us.
[3227.60 → 3232.98] Training eagles to snatch drones out of the skies to combat terrorism.
[3234.26 → 3235.18] Freaking awesome.
[3235.56 → 3236.52] Way to go, France.
[3236.66 → 3236.98] I'm down.
[3237.12 → 3238.20] You guys are amazing.
[3238.20 → 3242.94] So basically, they trained them from a very young age.
[3244.06 → 3246.66] And they wanted a way to take down drones without shooting at them.
[3246.80 → 3247.24] So there you go.
[3247.26 → 3248.50] They trained them from a very young age.
[3248.58 → 3252.44] They're hatched on top of drones to get used to feeding from them.
[3252.72 → 3254.96] And practice drones have meat attached to them.
[3256.04 → 3256.98] This is amazing.
[3256.98 → 3264.98] So the military is designing leather and Keller mittens and anti-blast material to protect their talons.
[3266.18 → 3266.66] Wow.
[3268.52 → 3270.04] That's freaking awesome.
[3270.42 → 3271.44] I'm also surprised.
[3271.58 → 3277.18] Like, if you hear the headline, Army Trains Eagle to Attack Drones, you would think it's the U.S.
[3277.18 → 3278.06] But it was France.
[3278.36 → 3278.98] I know, right?
[3280.12 → 3281.88] It's like, take that, America.
[3282.42 → 3285.74] France is going to – no, no, this one.
[3285.74 → 3286.10] Okay.
[3286.10 → 3286.94] Okay.
[3287.38 → 3288.56] Last topic for the day.
[3289.36 → 3291.76] GTX 1080 Ti rumours.
[3291.92 → 3297.34] NVIDIA will be holding a GTX gaming celebration event on February 28th, allegedly.
[3299.36 → 3303.22] Just after AMD's Capsaicin and Cream event the same day.
[3303.42 → 3306.44] So the original article here is from Overclock3D.net.
[3306.52 → 3307.64] I don't know any of this stuff.
[3308.12 → 3312.00] NVIDIA states that this event is one that you don't want to miss,
[3312.00 → 3316.80] with many people speculating that the event will be used to launch new GPU hardware.
[3316.80 → 3319.08] How very interesting.
[3320.26 → 3320.80] All right.
[3321.30 → 3324.36] So last thing left for today is – oh, yeah.
[3324.40 → 3324.92] Hold on a second.
[3325.24 → 3325.68] There you go.
[3325.92 → 3326.22] So –
[3326.22 → 3326.62] There you go.
[3326.68 → 3328.26] That is the rumour – oh, I don't even know.
[3328.30 → 3329.22] Is that just Photoshopped?
[3329.22 → 3330.10] I think it's just a mock-up, yeah.
[3330.10 → 3331.10] That just looks Photoshopped.
[3331.10 → 3333.94] The Ti kind of just looks shoved in there, so yeah.
[3334.12 → 3335.72] Yeah, I don't think that's a real one.
[3335.92 → 3336.98] No, no, no.
[3337.04 → 3337.88] This is pretty – okay.
[3338.12 → 3338.40] Anyway.
[3338.48 → 3338.86] There it is.
[3338.94 → 3341.74] Which leaves our last topic as Float plane Club.
[3341.74 → 3346.14] So those of you who aren't familiar with Float plane Club, in a nutshell,
[3346.56 → 3351.14] it's a super cool way to watch Linus Media Group videos one week early.
[3351.70 → 3356.28] We've actually got way more members than we were expecting to have at this point in the process.
[3356.60 → 3363.24] But I just want to tease you guys with what's going to be coming to Float plane Club in the next week.
[3363.68 → 3365.56] Or, no, not what's going to be coming to Float plane Club.
[3365.66 → 3365.82] Sorry.
[3366.06 → 3370.84] What's going to be coming to YouTube, what is already available on Float plane Club now.
[3370.84 → 3377.42] So starting on tomorrow – actually, it's going to be a heck of a week.
[3378.26 → 3381.46] So right – oh, right.
[3381.50 → 3381.74] No, no.
[3381.82 → 3382.98] What is already there?
[3383.30 → 3385.20] What is already there is – right.
[3385.78 → 3387.22] Apple AirPods alternatives.
[3388.02 → 3394.98] So we took, for a spin, a bunch of wireless earbuds that are a lot cheaper,
[3395.12 → 3397.62] or in some cases even more expensive than the Apple AirPods,
[3397.62 → 3400.12] to kind of determine, is Apple really overpriced?
[3400.12 → 3401.30] Or is it just expensive?
[3401.76 → 3404.84] We've got Server Room Upgrade Vlog, Part 2 of 3.
[3405.40 → 3408.74] We've got our investigation into bulk thermal compounds.
[3408.88 → 3410.64] So we bought a kilogram of thermal compound,
[3410.78 → 3413.82] and we find out, is buying your thermal compound in bulk worth it?
[3414.20 → 3416.44] We've got Dell's Inspired Gaming.
[3416.64 → 3420.70] So their new replacement for the Inspired 90, whatever –
[3420.70 → 3422.04] Inspired 15, whatever it was.
[3422.34 → 3424.46] So this time they're really calling it Inspired Gaming,
[3424.58 → 3426.86] and it's looking like a pretty cool little machine.
[3427.58 → 3431.00] We've got – that was a simultaneous release.
[3432.00 → 3435.22] We've got Server Room Upgrade Vlog, Part 3 of 3.
[3435.46 → 3435.90] Woo!
[3436.08 → 3436.36] Woo!
[3436.36 → 3436.56] Woo!
[3437.76 → 3440.40] And that's it.
[3440.88 → 3441.12] Yeah.
[3441.36 → 3443.74] So all of those are up on Float plane Club right now,
[3443.76 → 3446.64] and we've actually got Fastest Possible topics up there as well.
[3446.76 → 3447.08] We sure do.
[3447.08 → 3449.04] Which I can't find, unfortunately, right now.
[3449.04 → 3450.98] But if you know them off the top of your head, that might be helpful.
[3450.98 → 3454.58] Well, we just pushed one out today on the Nintendo Switch.
[3454.58 → 3454.86] Error!
[3454.90 → 3455.40] Pushed one out.
[3455.52 → 3456.38] Plopped one out today.
[3456.44 → 3456.68] Yeah.
[3456.98 → 3457.24] Oh.
[3459.10 → 3459.26] On –
[3459.26 → 3465.60] We plopped out the video today, if you would prefer that, on the Nintendo Switch.
[3466.06 → 3469.02] Nintendo Switch, as fast as possible, now available on Float plane Club.
[3469.54 → 3475.02] It's a pretty comprehensive, yet pretty quick rundown of the new features you can expect on the Nintendo Switch.
[3475.42 → 3478.50] So you have that to look forward to on YouTube next week.
[3478.54 → 3479.52] Actually on Switch launch day.
[3480.00 → 3480.32] Cool.
[3480.32 → 3483.02] Oh, and did we mention DRM-free downloads?
[3483.14 → 3483.50] Is that right?
[3483.64 → 3484.52] For Float plane Club?
[3484.56 → 3486.20] Yeah, DRM-free downloads for Float plane Club.
[3486.32 → 3489.42] So there are no ads, DRM-free downloads, and early access.
[3489.64 → 3490.04] There we go.
[3490.92 → 3494.52] Alongside that, we also got the Channel Super Fun release that came out to Float plane.
[3494.58 → 3494.92] No one cares.
[3496.78 → 3498.02] We threw some axes.
[3498.38 → 3499.06] It was wonderful.
[3499.18 → 3501.14] We threw some shade is what just got thrown.
[3501.36 → 3501.44] Oh!
[3501.88 → 3504.14] You get to see Dennis throw sharp objects.
[3504.38 → 3504.60] Yeah.
[3504.64 → 3505.78] So, I mean, how can you say no?
[3506.04 → 3509.22] So we linked where you guys can join up, and we will see you again next week.
[3509.22 → 3511.08] Same bat time, same bat channel.
[3513.48 → 3514.22] Roll the outro.
[3514.22 → 3515.36] Oh!
[3515.36 → 3516.60] My nose is existing.
[3517.38 → 3518.62] I have like a few notes.
[3519.04 → 3520.28] So, I'm still waiting.
[3520.28 → 3535.66] Sorry?
[3536.66 → 3537.20] Not quite.
[3538.46 → 3539.02] And...
[3539.02 → 3539.84] Hold on.
[3540.20 → 3540.46] Almost.
[3540.46 → 3549.78] And...
[3549.78 → 3550.30] And...
[3550.30 → 3550.50] industry.
[3550.74 → 3551.34] I am really liking the band.
[3551.34 → 3551.78] And...
[3552.00 → 3552.92] What?
