[0.00 → 3.82] We're already live. It's already done. Thank you, Colton. I appreciate the help.
[4.26 → 7.60] It was great. It was great. We have awesome news this week.
[7.70 → 10.42] I'm sure you guys know of at least some of it.
[10.54 → 13.48] There's been the crazy Battlefield controversy going on.
[13.90 → 15.10] Why do I keep us on a big Battlefield?
[15.40 → 21.46] The crazy Battlefront controversy going on with the most downvoted comment of all time on Reddit and all this other stuff.
[21.92 → 24.12] We're, of course, going to talk about that.
[24.12 → 33.76] But there's also some other crazy things, too, like the Firefox hardware survey has some interesting nuggets of information for us that we're going to analyze later on.
[34.12 → 37.38] And Face ID hacked in the first week.
[37.58 → 37.90] Bam!
[38.06 → 38.68] Suck it, Apple.
[38.96 → 42.38] Oh, this is not good for anybody, except for the people who did it.
[42.82 → 43.54] I guess, yeah.
[43.72 → 53.58] And if you were watching last night, Tesla unveiled, finally, their semi-truck and, a surprise, the second iteration of their Roadster, which was their original vehicle.
[53.58 → 54.02] Yeah.
[54.60 → 55.58] New fastest car ever.
[55.98 → 58.12] Fastest production car of all time.
[58.38 → 59.38] Super epic intro.
[60.66 → 61.90] It's not started.
[61.98 → 62.44] There we go.
[63.88 → 64.36] Almost.
[72.58 → 73.82] The Wang Show.
[74.58 → 75.70] Come on.
[80.22 → 81.82] Total.
[82.40 → 82.98] Thank you.
[82.98 → 85.30] A one in three chance Total Z-Box system.
[85.44 → 85.88] Enter to win.
[85.98 → 86.44] Heck yeah.
[87.20 → 87.90] Mack Weldon.
[88.00 → 88.68] 20% off.
[89.30 → 90.04] I fix it.
[90.24 → 91.00] Protect Toolkit.
[92.10 → 92.60] Why not?
[92.76 → 93.50] There we go.
[93.86 → 94.10] Bam.
[94.26 → 94.82] We're back.
[95.34 → 97.28] And just right into it with the Battlefront news, I think.
[98.00 → 98.56] Let's do it.
[99.04 → 100.84] Actually, I'm going to cut in slightly before this.
[100.92 → 101.82] Shameless self-promotion.
[102.06 → 103.52] Big charity stream happening tomorrow.
[103.66 → 105.40] 24 hours on my Twitch channel.
[105.84 → 108.04] Twitch.tv slash Luke underscore LAIR.
[108.04 → 109.66] Going at least 24 hours.
[109.72 → 111.44] I think it's supposed to be like 27 hours.
[112.12 → 113.54] Doing a bunch of different games.
[113.62 → 114.38] One game per hour.
[114.50 → 115.32] Iterating every year.
[115.42 → 116.02] Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[116.20 → 116.66] Show up.
[116.66 → 116.98] Insane, dude.
[117.10 → 118.18] Help support Extra Life.
[118.32 → 119.14] It's going to be awesome.
[119.40 → 119.82] Okay, bye.
[119.92 → 120.24] Anyway.
[120.36 → 120.72] Next topic.
[120.72 → 122.24] Beware or be mean.
[122.72 → 125.16] Or just enjoy your day in some other way.
[126.22 → 126.66] Battlefront.
[127.12 → 128.14] Crazy stuff happening.
[128.40 → 129.40] There was a post on Reddit.
[129.46 → 130.50] We're going to show it here right now.
[131.48 → 136.06] The Reddit post was talking about how it takes 40 hours to unlock a hero.
[136.64 → 138.14] They talk about a bunch of different stuff.
[138.22 → 139.68] The post has been updated a few times.
[139.78 → 143.32] Actually been very well taken care of by the hotter potato.
[143.86 → 145.36] This has been nuts.
[145.36 → 149.48] If you've been on the internet this week, almost at all, even if you're not that into gaming,
[149.48 → 151.22] you have probably heard about this.
[151.34 → 156.76] There are huge controversies where countries like Belgium are considering classifying different
[156.76 → 161.38] games as gambling, online gambling, because of how loot boxes are being handled, because
[161.38 → 168.02] this post has gotten so big that it has gotten two people that manage laws in countries, which
[168.02 → 168.70] is pretty crazy.
[168.92 → 171.26] Congressmen are being contacted about this.
[171.38 → 176.34] It's blown up to a ludicrous degree, which is good or bad, depending on your stance.
[176.44 → 177.40] Probably bad.
[178.34 → 179.08] Let's start at the beginning.
[179.48 → 179.88] Yeah.
[180.08 → 181.80] So the beginning is this post.
[182.02 → 187.32] And then what really blew it up is the developer responding, which usually makes things better.
[187.42 → 188.66] It super did not.
[188.80 → 192.98] I'm sure a lot of this is same old, same old from what you guys have heard.
[193.26 → 195.86] So before we get into their response, why don't we outline what happened at the beginning
[195.86 → 196.04] with?
[196.12 → 200.62] It was basically everyone getting super, super-duper mad because the new Star Wars Battlefront
[200.62 → 204.78] 2 game from EA, which is a flagship title that costs 80 bucks.
[204.94 → 205.24] Yes.
[205.24 → 211.48] also has heavily these pay-to-win game mechanics.
[211.48 → 216.38] So how that kind of works, and I played in the beta and I started to feel it as well, is
[216.38 → 218.10] a lot of games have loot boxes.
[218.36 → 221.80] You've got Overwatch, where you get a bunch of different skins or portraits or whatever.
[222.28 → 226.16] Shadow of War had some issues here as well, where it could really help you with your gameplay,
[226.16 → 229.50] but I beat on the hardest difficulty without using any of them.
[229.66 → 230.38] That's not a brag.
[230.46 → 231.48] A lot of people did this.
[231.82 → 233.50] It's not that difficult of a game.
[234.32 → 235.86] And it's not that big of a deal.
[236.42 → 238.04] This is where it became a big problem.
[238.20 → 243.70] This is a multiplayer game, and they directly give you extremely powerful advantages against
[243.70 → 244.24] your enemy.
[244.48 → 246.66] Not just aesthetic skins and stuff like that, like Overwatch.
[246.78 → 247.06] No.
[247.28 → 247.50] Yeah.
[247.68 → 249.58] Like, directly power.
[249.74 → 250.38] You are better.
[250.50 → 251.46] You do more damage.
[251.78 → 252.82] You regent more health.
[252.92 → 253.74] You have more health.
[253.84 → 255.24] You lock onto targets faster.
[255.24 → 258.88] You don't get locked onto as fast, these types of things.
[258.98 → 262.44] But surely you can achieve those things from just playing the game and not spending money.
[262.70 → 266.06] Yes, but it takes a ludicrous amount of time.
[266.12 → 266.82] How much time?
[266.94 → 271.46] I don't know the exact hours, but I think someone calculated it as, like, over six months.
[271.50 → 273.38] It's 40 hours to unlock a hero.
[273.72 → 275.18] But there's other stuff as well.
[275.18 → 278.28] Like, the hero, that's definitely part of it.
[278.38 → 281.92] And you can't get Vader without playing the game for 40 hours, which is ridiculous,
[282.04 → 284.24] because most people aren't going to play the game for 40 hours.
[284.26 → 284.70] Like a single player.
[284.70 → 286.08] Or, like, just the game.
[286.20 → 286.94] The game.
[287.76 → 292.16] How it's balanced is not based on skill, which is another thing that's pissing people off.
[292.42 → 300.08] If you do really, really well in a round, and you kill a ton of people, you're not going to get that many more credits than someone who just played for the same amount of time that you did.
[300.14 → 300.44] Okay.
[300.72 → 302.92] Which is bugging a lot of people, which makes sense.
[302.94 → 304.52] Sounds like good money-making business practice.
[304.52 → 308.92] Yeah, because you have to pour a huge amount of time in, like 40 hours, to unlock something like a hero.
[309.08 → 311.62] The part that bugs me even more than the hero part.
[311.72 → 316.00] The hero part is just, it hits that 40-hour number, so it's easily digestible.
[316.22 → 316.58] Yeah, okay.
[316.58 → 317.08] Okay.
[317.08 → 317.96] The cards.
[318.16 → 321.28] You get these different cards that you put on your character that give you different bonuses.
[321.54 → 321.80] Okay.
[321.92 → 324.12] Say you're playing the spaceship combat mode.
[324.84 → 325.60] I'm in a bomber.
[326.00 → 326.78] You're in a TIE fighter.
[326.78 → 328.96] I've spent a bunch of money on the game.
[329.10 → 331.24] Just money man, tossing it all over the place.
[331.52 → 336.18] I have something that makes it so that I lock onto targets 200% faster.
[336.32 → 336.94] Holy cow.
[337.04 → 340.58] Also, my bombs do increase damage, and I move faster.
[340.86 → 342.12] You don't have any cards.
[342.46 → 343.40] You just started the game.
[343.46 → 344.18] You just launched up.
[344.42 → 345.78] You were just fighting another bomber.
[346.32 → 346.98] You're in a fighter.
[347.14 → 348.66] You're able to get away from him and get out.
[348.74 → 349.36] You're like, sick.
[349.42 → 350.42] Okay, I got this new move.
[350.42 → 354.06] I spin and list slightly to the left, and everything works out great.
[354.20 → 355.58] You try to do the same thing against me.
[355.58 → 357.30] I lock onto you 200% faster.
[357.48 → 358.34] You can't get out of the way.
[358.40 → 358.72] Conked.
[358.76 → 359.06] You're dead.
[359.30 → 359.74] Yeah, okay.
[359.84 → 363.78] That directly, strongly affected gameplay based on card advantages.
[364.34 → 367.20] Now, to get to the top, there are different tiers of these cards as well.
[367.50 → 370.38] To get to the top tier of cards, you kind of have to craft your way up.
[371.14 → 373.72] The easiest way to get crafting materials is loot boxes.
[374.48 → 377.42] The easiest way to craft your tier up to the top card is loot boxes.
[377.82 → 384.02] People who spend money will be directly better at online competitive modes because of this.
[384.02 → 385.72] And it's lots of money.
[385.86 → 389.64] If I remember correctly, if you want to unlock everything, like top tier of every card in
[389.64 → 392.34] all the heroes, it's like $2,100 or something.
[392.60 → 393.68] I'm saying that off the top of my head.
[393.72 → 394.44] I don't remember exactly where it is.
[394.44 → 397.40] But is that even a realistic thing that anyone would want to do?
[398.08 → 399.08] Or realistically do?
[399.10 → 399.28] That's the thing.
[399.54 → 399.90] Yes.
[400.26 → 400.58] Oh.
[400.96 → 402.04] It absolutely is.
[402.08 → 405.46] If you look into the game industry right now, especially the mobile side, which are
[405.46 → 409.04] the guys that have been doing more of this kind of like loot box, pay-to-win mechanics,
[409.04 → 412.98] it hasn't been in a lot of full price games because that's ridiculous.
[413.98 → 415.14] That's the whole controversy.
[415.30 → 417.96] Do you think people would be as mad if this game was free to play?
[418.40 → 418.60] No.
[418.74 → 419.20] Or pay-to-win?
[419.30 → 420.20] I don't think they'd be nearly as mad.
[420.20 → 421.22] Because you already paid $80.
[421.78 → 422.02] Yeah.
[422.60 → 427.26] So what they're targeting is what's called in the gaming industry whales.
[427.84 → 428.12] Right.
[428.62 → 429.82] Small amounts of people.
[430.14 → 430.94] I've heard people.
[431.24 → 433.32] I know PewDiePie in his videos said 10%.
[433.32 → 435.04] I doubt it's anywhere near that high.
[435.04 → 439.46] I'm going to go with 1% or lower of players will spend a ludicrous amount of money.
[439.64 → 444.14] These are the guys that will play a mobile game and just be like, I'm going to spend
[444.14 → 447.94] thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars just to wreck all of you.
[448.24 → 448.76] Literally thousands.
[448.90 → 452.60] I spoke to, when I was travelling, I met some people from Silicon Valley who worked in the
[452.60 → 456.34] industry, and they said they had a very small percentage of users who had spent over $100,000
[456.34 → 457.90] just on that mobile app.
[458.26 → 458.44] Yeah.
[458.54 → 458.90] Insane.
[459.34 → 460.08] Absolutely nuts.
[460.08 → 467.80] And there are definitely lots of people that will spend that $2,100 to, on day one, have
[467.80 → 469.30] a huge advantage on everyone else.
[469.60 → 470.74] Why would you want that?
[470.98 → 472.10] You might as well put in cheats.
[472.30 → 473.80] Is it really that fun to have God mode?
[474.42 → 477.28] It's not quite God mode, but it is a noticeable advantage.
[477.42 → 481.94] And the biggest issue for me is it creates a concept in the game where when someone kills
[481.94 → 487.54] you, you can legitimately say that it was because of something that wasn't skill.
[487.54 → 490.74] Yeah, you can lose and be like, overpowered, that's IMA.
[491.64 → 496.18] He just spent more money on the game, that's why he won, and you might not be wrong, which
[496.18 → 497.16] is ridiculous.
[497.34 → 498.82] Why would you want to make a game like that?
[499.06 → 502.30] In lots of games where you're like, oh, that gun's just overpowered, the response from
[502.30 → 504.48] pretty much everyone else is going to be like, okay, then use it.
[504.88 → 507.60] Or like, find a way to counter it, get good, something like that.
[507.80 → 510.68] In this game, you could be like, he just spent more money, what can I do?
[511.24 → 512.60] And that's a legitimate stance.
[512.60 → 513.56] And that is ridiculous.
[513.70 → 514.98] That shouldn't be able to be a legitimate stance.
[514.98 → 517.42] But it has been made so by the developers.
[517.80 → 522.60] And it's ridiculous because of one of the statements that they said in this official
[522.60 → 527.26] post, which I'm going to jump back to here, which drives me absolutely insane.
[527.34 → 528.86] It drove the entire internet insane.
[528.96 → 529.94] And I'm sure you've all heard this.
[530.22 → 531.44] But where is it?
[531.54 → 532.16] The, the, the, the, the.
[532.78 → 533.70] And you really mean that?
[533.72 → 535.06] This is like a record-breaking post.
[535.06 → 535.42] Oh, yeah.
[535.44 → 536.68] Record-breaking downvote.
[536.72 → 539.50] It says right now negative 20.9 thousand.
[539.72 → 541.42] But it's way more than that.
[541.48 → 542.18] I don't know what happened.
[542.18 → 544.92] It must have been on a slope or autocorrected curve, whatever.
[545.72 → 548.48] But I saw it personally at over 600,000.
[548.68 → 550.84] And I'm sure it was higher than that at some point in time.
[551.00 → 552.02] But yeah.
[552.82 → 553.64] Let's see here.
[554.00 → 557.98] We'll continuously adjust our progression mechanics to give players a sense of accomplishment
[557.98 → 561.20] as they explore all of Battlefront 2.
[561.20 → 566.28] That has driven everyone nuts because the sense of accomplishment isn't skill.
[567.40 → 569.62] It's not doing better at the game gives you more credits.
[569.76 → 572.34] It's spending more time on the game gives you more credits.
[572.78 → 577.62] And you can just skip all of that and have a sense of freaking accomplishment by paying
[577.62 → 582.00] a bunch of money into the game and instantaneously being better than everyone.
[582.38 → 587.68] Removing other people's sense of accomplishment by squishing on them with your cash because you
[587.68 → 590.20] bought better freaking cards or heroes or whatever.
[590.20 → 594.28] The question I have is when you come into this as a noob who hasn't spent anything yet
[594.28 → 599.08] and you get absolutely demolished by someone who has, are you just going to put the game
[599.08 → 600.06] down and not play it anymore?
[600.20 → 601.82] Or are you going to be motivated to spend?
[602.08 → 603.54] They're obviously banking on the latter.
[603.78 → 606.30] But what do you think is actually going to happen for people?
[606.44 → 607.84] I think it's going to be a little bit of both.
[608.08 → 609.12] If you have...
[609.12 → 612.52] This is the frustrating situation you have right here.
[612.60 → 615.20] If you have a group of friends...
[616.14 → 618.62] Some people are saying, yeah, I think it was a slightly different quote.
[618.62 → 621.96] I don't know if it was from a different post or this one has been edited or what, but I
[621.96 → 623.06] think it was slightly different.
[623.36 → 627.46] Anyway, if you have a group of friends that all play games together.
[627.58 → 630.44] You guys have been playing games together since high school or something.
[631.12 → 634.38] And two out of six of the friends start playing Battlefront.
[635.16 → 635.52] All right.
[635.92 → 638.78] You normally play a game all together, but these guys want to play Battlefront.
[638.86 → 639.54] They just bought it.
[639.88 → 643.18] Then maybe one or two more guys buy Battlefront because they were playing.
[643.44 → 646.28] The last two guys are going to cave because four to six have it anyway.
[646.28 → 650.28] Guys, it's very easy if a couple of people in a group start playing a game that everyone
[650.28 → 652.58] will eventually play because everyone just wants to play together, and it's something
[652.58 → 653.10] new and shiny.
[653.38 → 653.98] That's great.
[654.22 → 655.28] Now you're all playing together.
[655.68 → 659.98] But Jim and Larry don't have as much time.
[660.64 → 661.76] They spend more time at work.
[661.88 → 662.58] They're great gamers.
[662.82 → 663.78] They're great in your crew.
[663.92 → 666.08] You love having them there, but they don't have as much time.
[666.20 → 669.36] So to make up for the time, they're going to spend money on the game.
[669.36 → 673.94] Even though they're great gamers, they're top in score charts and everything, they could
[673.94 → 677.38] normally make up the time by getting more credits and just doing better in the game.
[677.52 → 681.90] In something like Counter-Strike, it doesn't matter at all because they don't care if they
[681.90 → 682.92] don't have the fancy skins.
[683.14 → 684.42] They still get the same freaking gun.
[684.84 → 686.56] So when they're like Overwatch, it doesn't matter.
[686.74 → 688.00] They don't care if they don't look as cool.
[688.50 → 689.38] They have the same heroes.
[690.16 → 690.86] Everything's fine.
[691.68 → 693.24] Or even in Destiny, they just scale it.
[693.64 → 694.46] They just scale it.
[694.46 → 699.08] And in Destiny, there's loot boxes, sort of bright engrams, but they just give you aesthetic
[699.08 → 700.36] items, and it doesn't really matter.
[700.70 → 706.56] These are games where you can catch up through skill or catch up because there's nothing to
[706.56 → 707.14] catch up on.
[707.62 → 710.32] Instead of, oh, I'm going to catch up by spending money.
[710.42 → 712.28] That is my mechanic to catch up to wrestling.
[712.28 → 714.02] I didn't realize there was this time issue.
[714.12 → 715.80] It's almost completely separate from the money issue.
[716.44 → 719.70] It's, yeah, well, that's the big problem is...
[719.70 → 720.62] They kind of work together.
[720.62 → 723.42] The money issue almost alleviates the time issue.
[724.46 → 726.20] But that's...
[726.20 → 726.82] Some sicko.
[727.04 → 728.10] That's the mechanic, though.
[728.20 → 728.90] Yeah, yeah.
[729.02 → 731.10] So the problem I have is because...
[731.10 → 732.82] Let's take a look at my brother.
[732.90 → 738.30] My brother works a lot and has crazy work hours because he drives truck for movie production
[738.30 → 738.76] companies.
[739.16 → 741.10] So they work to crazy hours of the night.
[741.10 → 742.88] They work crazy long hours in general.
[743.02 → 746.76] And you usually get on for a specific show, and they want to film that entire show.
[746.96 → 749.66] So for the duration of that show, you're working nuts amount of hours.
[749.66 → 755.54] If he wants to play a game like this, it's very likely that it would make logical sense.
[756.02 → 757.04] I'm not saying he's going to.
[757.12 → 758.06] I'm not saying he's not going to.
[758.14 → 762.84] But it would make logical sense for him to buy some boxes so he can catch up to the rest
[762.84 → 765.76] of us that would be able to play more if we were playing this game.
[766.54 → 768.16] That makes sense for him.
[768.40 → 771.74] The problem is that the game is based around that.
[771.88 → 772.02] Yeah.
[772.02 → 774.86] And it is trying to push people to do that.
[774.96 → 779.66] If gaming companies start making money, they'll try to find ways that make more money.
[780.00 → 780.14] Yeah.
[780.22 → 782.56] The time and money thing are mutually reinforcing.
[782.74 → 782.92] Yeah.
[783.26 → 783.44] Yeah.
[783.54 → 784.66] The thing about...
[784.66 → 789.80] Back to the question of if you are more likely to just stop playing versus more likely to
[789.80 → 792.62] spend money in order to not get squashed.
[793.30 → 796.42] You already have this sunk cost of 80 bucks.
[796.52 → 797.38] That's a big issue too.
[797.82 → 798.26] And like...
[798.26 → 799.42] If it was free, you could walk away.
[799.56 → 799.82] Yeah.
[799.82 → 802.24] Oh, if I just spend 10 more bucks, I'll have more fun.
[802.48 → 804.82] But then it's gambling, which is another huge issue.
[805.12 → 809.28] So you spend 10 more bucks, and maybe you want to play the heavy class in the ground war
[809.28 → 811.00] game instead of the space game or whatever.
[811.12 → 811.54] You want to play...
[811.54 → 812.84] Let's just go with the heavy class.
[813.18 → 815.48] And you don't get any of the cards that you want for the heavy class.
[815.88 → 816.92] You already spent your 10 bucks.
[816.98 → 817.34] It's gone.
[817.44 → 818.12] You didn't get any of the things that you wanted.
[818.12 → 820.44] Because the cards come out of loot boxes and the loot boxes are random.
[820.46 → 820.78] Are random.
[821.56 → 824.18] So it's gambling because maybe now you have to spend more.
[824.32 → 824.94] You don't know.
[825.12 → 827.96] I like playing the bomber in the star fighting game thing.
[827.96 → 828.68] I played in the beta.
[828.68 → 831.28] I only want cards for the bomber.
[831.40 → 832.66] I play the bomber on both sides.
[832.78 → 834.56] I play the tie bomber and I play the A-wing.
[834.76 → 835.24] I...
[835.24 → 838.12] If I don't get cards for the bomber, I'm just going to want more loot boxes.
[839.42 → 840.10] It's gambling.
[841.14 → 842.24] You can craft cards too.
[842.38 → 842.54] Yeah.
[842.60 → 843.22] And you can craft...
[843.22 → 845.56] Someone just in the chat just said you can craft cards too.
[846.46 → 846.82] Great.
[846.82 → 852.52] People who spend money in the game will be able to craft more cards because they'll have more materials from the other cards.
[852.74 → 854.06] And the more you play the game...
[854.06 → 861.30] If I played that spaceship combat game for enough time, I would eventually want to branch out of just fighting with the bomber ship.
[861.36 → 862.62] It's not necessarily true for everyone.
[862.74 → 863.24] Or Y-Wing.
[863.34 → 863.52] Sorry.
[863.92 → 865.04] It's not necessarily true for...
[865.04 → 866.26] A-Wing is a little fast one.
[866.34 → 866.52] Sorry.
[867.48 → 869.10] It's not necessarily true for everybody.
[869.64 → 871.96] But a lot of people, including myself, are going to want to branch out.
[872.06 → 873.48] Then they'll want cards for other things.
[873.60 → 875.10] Then you're running out of crafting materials.
[875.22 → 878.10] Then it costs $2,100 to get all the cards in the game.
[878.24 → 881.86] Because now you actually enjoy the game because you spent $80, and it's the only game you bought this season.
[882.00 → 882.22] Maybe.
[883.26 → 884.14] It's just frustrating.
[884.26 → 887.84] Because now that it's here, they're building the surrounding game.
[887.84 → 890.28] That's one thing that I actually defended Shadow of War with.
[891.10 → 896.80] Is when playing Shadow of War, it didn't feel like they had built the game around the idea of the loot boxes.
[897.20 → 899.28] The loot boxes gave you money.
[899.62 → 900.86] They gave you some followers.
[901.20 → 905.94] But the entire game, it's like smashed in your face that there's these...
[905.94 → 906.84] No, not Shadow of War.
[906.98 → 910.46] It's smashed in your face that there are these orcs all over the place.
[910.60 → 912.08] And you just need to press the one button.
[912.34 → 915.56] And it actually ends the combat faster if you want to recruit them.
[915.56 → 918.70] So the game gives you these orcs all the time.
[918.76 → 920.16] So it's not that big of a deal.
[920.26 → 921.06] I didn't mind it that much.
[921.12 → 923.08] It didn't feel like the game was designed around it.
[923.50 → 926.24] Battlefront absolutely, absolutely.
[926.38 → 931.52] Battlefront 2 feels like it was designed around the idea of the loot boxes instead of the other way around.
[932.28 → 933.12] Which is bad.
[933.28 → 934.26] This is very bad.
[934.40 → 935.68] So we haven't even got to the news portion.
[935.88 → 944.22] Which is the fact that after a brutal AMA where they just made everyone even more mad with their question dodging and brutal unsatisfactory answers.
[944.22 → 950.20] They made another determination which was for now they're just going to turn off all of it.
[950.58 → 955.30] The ability to purchase crystals in-game will now be completely offline.
[956.30 → 960.90] And John told me that actually if you go to the interface where you go to buy these crystals,
[960.90 → 965.58] instead of just removing the button and not letting you go into that area,
[965.76 → 969.74] you can click the button, and it brings you just like a random Jacky blank page.
[971.54 → 974.06] Maybe people on the chat can confirm or deny this.
[974.30 → 975.46] I haven't seen that.
[975.56 → 976.50] I don't have it.
[977.06 → 979.60] Someone in the chat said Luke won't be streaming Battlefront 2.
[979.98 → 982.42] Technically, I will be streaming Battlefront 2.
[982.50 → 984.08] I'll be streaming Battlefront 2 tomorrow.
[984.08 → 988.40] It'll just be the original one because I'm playing games throughout the years.
[988.56 → 991.88] So I don't remember what year the original Battlefront 2 came out in,
[992.12 → 993.62] but I'm playing it for that year.
[993.68 → 997.00] So it's going to be all pixelated and wonky and fun.
[997.40 → 998.04] And fun.
[998.30 → 999.46] Most of all, fun.
[999.60 → 1000.74] There's no loot boxes.
[1001.54 → 1002.46] It's great.
[1003.06 → 1004.24] 2007, apparently.
[1004.42 → 1004.64] What?
[1004.80 → 1005.08] No.
[1006.06 → 1006.38] Maybe.
[1007.46 → 1008.78] It's not 2007.
[1008.78 → 1016.56] So the thing to note about them turning off this game mechanic for the buying
[1016.56 → 1017.76] is that they didn't remove it.
[1018.00 → 1019.04] They've just turned it off.
[1019.54 → 1023.14] And they say the ability to purchase crystals in-game will become available at a later date
[1023.14 → 1025.76] once EA has made changes to the game.
[1025.92 → 1029.78] So it's funny because the internet seemed to lag here a little bit.
[1030.30 → 1034.26] It felt like if you pile everyone, which isn't fair.
[1034.44 → 1034.98] It's not fair.
[1035.04 → 1035.36] I understand.
[1035.46 → 1038.50] If you pile everyone on the internet into one little hive mind bubble,
[1038.78 → 1040.52] they read the first part.
[1041.00 → 1044.00] And then about an hour or two later, read the second part.
[1044.16 → 1045.50] Because the whole internet rejoiced.
[1045.68 → 1046.94] Like, we did it, read it.
[1046.94 → 1048.00] We won.
[1048.00 → 1048.18] We won.
[1048.28 → 1049.70] They took microtransactions out.
[1050.40 → 1050.92] Accomplished.
[1051.32 → 1054.70] And then, like, starting about half an hour to an hour later,
[1054.78 → 1056.18] it started kind of bubbling up.
[1056.30 → 1061.20] And then by two hours later, it had passed posts about the original happiness.
[1061.40 → 1065.44] That, oh my goodness, they're just putting the microtransactions back in the game.
[1065.52 → 1067.74] And they called it the wait-what-ending.
[1067.74 → 1069.68] Yeah, exactly.
[1070.26 → 1070.48] Yeah.
[1070.84 → 1074.76] So, like, it's frustrating because this is so transparent.
[1075.60 → 1080.22] They're trying to get this huge wave of people that are refunding the game, like me,
[1080.64 → 1087.62] to rebuy it, play it long enough that now they're invested.
[1087.80 → 1089.36] Maybe they have a group of friends that play.
[1089.36 → 1093.22] Or I don't know how the great game guarantee works on Origin.
[1093.44 → 1095.32] I know that I played for zero hours.
[1095.62 → 1098.30] So I was, or zero minutes, zero seconds, whatever.
[1098.74 → 1099.30] So I was able to refund mine.
[1099.30 → 1100.30] So they're going to wait until that expires.
[1100.66 → 1101.42] I think so.
[1101.48 → 1103.04] But I don't know if that matters.
[1103.16 → 1104.74] I don't know how the great game guarantee works.
[1104.88 → 1108.74] But they're trying to, they're going to wait until people are kind of stuck in it.
[1108.98 → 1109.94] Or can't refund it.
[1110.00 → 1110.42] Or whatever.
[1110.42 → 1112.42] And then they'll put microtransactions back in.
[1112.68 → 1113.96] They'll make their money off their whales.
[1114.20 → 1114.84] And they'll move on.
[1114.98 → 1118.62] I'm sure that the microtransactions, I'm sure it's going to be, they're going to adjust
[1118.62 → 1120.46] it so you don't have to do so much work.
[1121.56 → 1123.26] The disparity won't be so huge.
[1123.46 → 1125.16] Okay, there was a huge issue there as well.
[1125.54 → 1126.32] Did you hear about this?
[1126.46 → 1128.62] So they reduced the cost of heroes.
[1129.44 → 1131.62] But then they reduced the amount of credits that you get.
[1131.70 → 1132.12] That's right.
[1132.98 → 1134.94] So they basically just, it was the same.
[1135.62 → 1139.78] Basically, they did two different moves that were both two-faced.
[1140.10 → 1140.64] Non-moves.
[1140.90 → 1141.12] Yeah.
[1141.90 → 1145.14] They were like, hey, we reduced the cost of heroes.
[1145.24 → 1146.90] By the way, we also reduced the amount of credits you get.
[1146.94 → 1147.50] Don't worry about it.
[1147.76 → 1147.96] Right.
[1148.08 → 1150.64] And then they're like, hey, we removed microtransactions of the game.
[1150.82 → 1152.22] By the way, they're also coming back.
[1152.28 → 1152.82] Don't worry about it.
[1153.26 → 1156.02] So it was like, a hero used to be a grand, but you start with a hundred bucks.
[1156.62 → 1158.48] Now, a hero is only a hundred bucks.
[1158.62 → 1159.72] But you start with ten bucks.
[1159.98 → 1160.30] Yeah.
[1160.30 → 1162.64] That's what you're saying?
[1162.96 → 1163.44] It's ridiculous.
[1163.54 → 1164.10] Yeah, essentially.
[1164.32 → 1169.94] So I guess this controversy just got so bad that they were actually afraid of losing their launch day sales.
[1169.98 → 1170.98] Like that upfront $80.
[1171.72 → 1172.08] Yes.
[1172.08 → 1176.50] That was going to get so heavily eroded that they're like, okay, we can't sacrifice that.
[1177.10 → 1183.02] And I wonder at some point, because a lot of these moves are so dense.
[1183.02 → 1192.48] Like a sense of accomplishment when you're answering a post, which its title is, it takes 40 hours to unlock a hero.
[1193.92 → 1195.44] And you can just buy it.
[1195.86 → 1199.96] Like that's so obviously not the right way to respond to that.
[1199.96 → 1205.82] I seriously wonder at some degree if this isn't just any press is good press.
[1206.50 → 1210.84] Because now every single gamer definitely knows about Battlefront.
[1211.36 → 1214.24] Every single mom and dad knows Battlefront is around.
[1214.52 → 1216.04] Nah, this is too bad.
[1216.18 → 1216.64] Too bad?
[1216.74 → 1217.08] It's too bad.
[1217.08 → 1223.64] Usually when companies take that strategy on, they only alienate people who weren't going to get their product anyway.
[1225.24 → 1225.74] You know what I mean?
[1226.06 → 1226.24] Yeah.
[1227.34 → 1231.54] Someone in the chat, ONI Image, I think.
[1231.88 → 1233.04] I probably butchered that name.
[1233.10 → 1233.44] I'm sorry.
[1233.92 → 1239.44] Said Disney CEO literally called up the EA CEO and told them to remove the option to pay for loot boxes
[1239.44 → 1242.46] because Disney started getting crap for purchasing mechanics towards children.
[1242.92 → 1245.00] I haven't seen anything about that at all.
[1245.00 → 1246.40] If Tiger did that, it would be pretty badass.
[1247.20 → 1248.90] Or he's just like looking out for a bro.
[1249.36 → 1251.28] He's like, yo, this is not going well for us.
[1251.84 → 1252.62] Don't do it.
[1253.36 → 1254.72] Yeah, I don't know.
[1254.86 → 1256.56] I haven't heard anything about that.
[1257.92 → 1260.32] But it is pretty brutal.
[1260.32 → 1269.32] There are people who have been posting examples of like the Disney Star Wars XD shows, the animated ones,
[1269.32 → 1277.34] where it's like a show about how gambling is bad based in the Star Wars universe.
[1278.32 → 1280.16] It's like a part of the Star Wars show.
[1280.20 → 1280.88] I think it's Rebels.
[1281.04 → 1283.16] And it's about how gambling is bad.
[1283.28 → 1286.72] And then they have a Star Wars game that has gambling in it.
[1286.72 → 1289.16] And you can say as much as you want, like this isn't a kid's game.
[1289.26 → 1290.40] Kids are going to play it.
[1292.06 → 1294.92] Like our generation, we played, I'm assuming you did as well.
[1295.04 → 1295.46] Grand Theft Auto.
[1295.54 → 1296.68] Shooter games pretty early.
[1296.72 → 1297.08] Bring it on.
[1297.16 → 1300.02] Grand Theft Auto was one of the ones that my parents were like, ah.
[1300.84 → 1303.92] I played it a little bit at like friends' houses, and they knew, and they didn't care.
[1304.04 → 1306.66] But like Halo, I was in their pretty early on.
[1306.74 → 1308.36] Counter-Strike, I was in there quite early on.
[1308.36 → 1309.70] Oh, it was anything goes when I grew up.
[1310.24 → 1310.86] Big time.
[1310.86 → 1317.22] And then like the thing is, now it's our generation and a little bit above that are starting to have, well, a fair bit above, I guess,
[1317.28 → 1321.78] that are starting to have kids at these ages that where you're talking about where they might watch something like Disney XD.
[1322.40 → 1328.12] You think our generation that grew up with like shooter games is going to care too much if someone plays Battlefront?
[1328.58 → 1331.02] Which is like pretty innocent for a shooter game.
[1331.28 → 1331.62] Oh, yeah.
[1332.32 → 1335.28] Like can you chop people up with your lightsabre?
[1335.92 → 1336.82] Humans, not just robots?
[1337.10 → 1338.80] I think it goes through them.
[1338.92 → 1340.20] I don't think they split in half.
[1340.20 → 1341.16] They just like fall over.
[1341.42 → 1346.94] Yeah, because like ever since I was eight, I've wanted to be able to just totally dismember people with charred remains.
[1347.16 → 1347.32] Yeah.
[1347.40 → 1349.16] I'm not sure if I could be wrong on that.
[1350.34 → 1353.10] So if you can't do that, then like that's vanilla.
[1353.74 → 1354.30] That's vanilla.
[1354.30 → 1355.28] But like, I don't know.
[1355.38 → 1357.98] Kids are absolutely going to be playing this game.
[1358.10 → 1360.30] It doesn't matter that it's ESR, B-rated, whatever.
[1360.50 → 1361.30] I don't even know what it is.
[1361.34 → 1361.94] Might be M.
[1362.12 → 1363.18] I don't know what they are.
[1363.28 → 1363.86] I don't look at them.
[1363.94 → 1364.54] There's no way it's that.
[1364.54 → 1365.72] What is the normal rating?
[1366.04 → 1366.26] Teen.
[1366.40 → 1367.16] Okay, that makes sense.
[1367.26 → 1367.78] Teen, whatever.
[1368.22 → 1369.66] Kids are definitely going to be playing it.
[1370.70 → 1371.68] And gambling's in it.
[1372.26 → 1376.72] And like a gambling mechanic that makes you better at the game is in it.
[1376.90 → 1377.58] And that's bad.
[1377.74 → 1379.00] Because kids always want to be better.
[1379.26 → 1383.08] There's always that kid in your school that was like, my shoes make me run faster.
[1383.66 → 1386.54] Now there's going to be some kid being like, I have a better card for my ship.
[1386.76 → 1387.38] I'm better than you.
[1387.38 → 1388.46] Yeah.
[1388.60 → 1393.50] I can see kids at school being like, you suck at Battlefront because you're a scrub.
[1393.90 → 1394.14] Yeah.
[1394.56 → 1396.42] I bet they don't say scrub anymore.
[1397.88 → 1399.70] They should bring it back because it's a retro way up.
[1399.88 → 1402.48] And it's pretty cool as far as I'm concerned.
[1402.48 → 1404.52] Laser James thinks you should bring scrub back.
[1404.52 → 1404.92] Yeah.
[1405.58 → 1408.80] I know we've talked about this topic for a long time, but it is pretty important.
[1408.88 → 1409.80] We can get on with it, though.
[1410.00 → 1411.24] We're pretty done, aren't we?
[1411.56 → 1411.78] Yeah.
[1411.82 → 1415.66] I guess I'll talk about the aftermath and kind of what to do and stuff.
[1415.98 → 1419.54] So a lot of people have been bringing this to local representatives because they're trying
[1419.54 → 1422.82] to get loot boxes and games classified as gambling.
[1423.06 → 1426.52] I do think, personally, that something needs to happen.
[1426.52 → 1435.24] I'm a little bit worried about how far seeing things in games as gambling could go because
[1435.24 → 1439.60] like randomized loot off of a monster that you have to farm by spending more time in the
[1439.60 → 1444.42] game where a game is subscription-based might be seen as gambling.
[1444.82 → 1445.42] Slippy slope.
[1445.72 → 1448.82] So it depends on where it ends, but something needs to happen.
[1449.24 → 1452.74] And loot boxes are just horrible.
[1452.74 → 1457.12] So maybe contact your local authorities to some degree.
[1458.32 → 1461.78] Well, I can tell you the language that the Belgium Commission was using.
[1462.02 → 1462.04] Yeah.
[1462.40 → 1465.98] The Belgian Gambling Commission is investigating Battlefront because of loot boxes.
[1466.12 → 1472.62] And what they said was, loot crates that you purchase without knowing what's inside can
[1472.62 → 1477.56] be considered gambling because your ability to succeed in the game is dependent on chance.
[1477.80 → 1479.10] And therefore, it's a game of chance.
[1479.14 → 1481.02] And if it's a game of chance, then you need a permit.
[1481.02 → 1485.94] So if that individual item is purchased, and it's a random chance.
[1486.38 → 1487.92] That's a good way to define it.
[1488.04 → 1493.18] Because I don't want to screw with random chance that is inherently built within games.
[1493.32 → 1497.86] Well, I think that the emphasis here, in my interpretation anyway, is that your success
[1497.86 → 1499.38] in the game really depends on it.
[1500.38 → 1500.72] Yeah.
[1500.96 → 1504.96] See, anyway, this is probably not a conversation to bother have on WAN Show.
[1504.96 → 1510.36] But that's where, like, if you get a legendary item in World of Warcraft, your success in
[1510.36 → 1512.08] the game could be based around getting that.
[1512.56 → 1513.84] It affects your success for sure.
[1514.02 → 1516.82] But it's not a loot crate.
[1516.92 → 1519.24] And it's a totally different style of system and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[1519.44 → 1521.58] It should be pretty easy to divide between.
[1521.68 → 1522.98] I don't think it's actually going to be a problem.
[1523.40 → 1524.88] So let's move on.
[1525.10 → 1525.88] Tough topic.
[1526.32 → 1526.60] Yeah.
[1526.76 → 1528.86] How about that face ID, that iPhone X?
[1528.98 → 1529.12] Yeah.
[1529.12 → 1529.80] Let's jump to that.
[1529.92 → 1530.26] Yeah.
[1530.26 → 1532.26] They did it.
[1532.54 → 1533.00] They hacked it.
[1533.16 → 1534.14] How did it happen exactly?
[1534.58 → 1535.52] It's so awesome.
[1536.10 → 1537.66] Bring up the pictures of this mask.
[1537.72 → 1538.64] It's actually a YouTube video.
[1538.74 → 1540.76] You can play the YouTube video just with the sound off.
[1540.84 → 1541.16] Is it on here?
[1541.16 → 1542.08] It has subtitles anyway.
[1542.70 → 1543.08] Yeah.
[1543.22 → 1544.22] It's one of the sources here.
[1544.24 → 1544.56] What the heck?
[1546.04 → 1546.46] Okay.
[1546.50 → 1547.18] I'm going to show.
[1548.70 → 1554.96] Security researchers in Vietnam have cracked Apple's new face ID using a composite mask consisting
[1554.96 → 1559.54] of a silicon nose, literally paper cut out 2D eyes.
[1559.54 → 1563.06] mounted on a plastic frame that they 3D printed.
[1565.58 → 1565.90] Okay.
[1566.30 → 1567.94] That's, this is no good.
[1568.34 → 1569.04] This, is not it?
[1569.14 → 1572.72] Well, there's like a one, like a two-minute video of them doing it.
[1572.72 → 1572.84] Yeah.
[1572.84 → 1574.18] This is 51 minutes.
[1574.32 → 1575.72] I was like, maybe I can find the right spot.
[1575.72 → 1576.94] I think it's linked from the forum thread.
[1577.04 → 1577.30] Okay.
[1577.38 → 1577.82] Give me a sec.
[1578.74 → 1584.14] So the caveat here is like, even though this mask only took 50 bucks to make, they did have
[1584.14 → 1588.34] to actually scan the victim's face with like a face scanner.
[1589.54 → 1591.70] So that's kind of integral to it.
[1591.70 → 1595.94] But other than that, the eyes were actually just printed out paper, and it's a simple silicon
[1595.94 → 1598.10] nose, silicone nose.
[1598.34 → 1602.02] Getting a scan of someone's face is going to be not that easy.
[1602.10 → 1603.26] What did they have to scan it with?
[1603.26 → 1610.24] They used a handheld, like dedicated scanner, but they say that in the future, you might
[1610.24 → 1612.02] be able to use one of those just like cell phone ones.
[1612.38 → 1612.72] Yeah.
[1612.96 → 1616.82] Or even just construct the image width, with images.
[1617.04 → 1618.44] Like just use images to make the model.
[1618.46 → 1618.64] Yeah.
[1618.66 → 1618.92] Okay.
[1619.04 → 1624.32] Because if you could be like sitting across the table at dinner with someone and, oh,
[1624.32 → 1625.22] I'm just texting.
[1625.22 → 1626.12] On the bus or like.
[1626.34 → 1626.40] Yeah.
[1626.58 → 1628.68] And inadvertently get someone's.
[1628.68 → 1629.86] You have to go around them though, right?
[1629.86 → 1630.30] Yeah.
[1632.08 → 1632.52] Yeah.
[1633.08 → 1638.12] So not that far because they just have the white meshing on, on most of the sides.
[1639.68 → 1641.60] So he just used that thing to unlock.
[1642.32 → 1644.40] Like if you look at it, the size of the face.
[1644.40 → 1649.18] I think they might show the front at some point here, but there's a there's a couple
[1649.18 → 1651.20] things about this.
[1652.12 → 1656.76] Number one is its hilarious because at launch, Apple said that it worked with professional
[1656.76 → 1661.42] mask makers and makeup artists in Hollywood to make sure that a mask couldn't be used
[1661.42 → 1663.16] to hack face ID.
[1663.92 → 1668.84] And these like random dudes have already done it with something that doesn't look all that
[1668.84 → 1669.34] professional.
[1670.16 → 1672.38] Well, that's the other thing is especially the eyes.
[1672.38 → 1676.78] It's literally just printed out in like his face, a picture of his face.
[1676.88 → 1680.50] They cut out the eyes from that picture and put it onto this like mannequin head.
[1680.50 → 1681.48] And that's wild.
[1681.66 → 1686.36] And the reason that's especially interesting is that people thought from the patents
[1686.36 → 1693.12] that Apple took out that eye movement factored in to face ID, but this would suggest otherwise.
[1693.28 → 1698.72] And if eye movement doesn't factor into face ID, then that means that you can use potentially
[1698.72 → 1703.86] someone who's unconscious, knocked out, or even dead to unlock a phone, which is pretty
[1703.86 → 1704.14] scary.
[1704.14 → 1708.80] Even the touch, what do they call that?
[1709.00 → 1709.42] Touch ID.
[1709.94 → 1710.16] Huh.
[1710.44 → 1710.62] Yeah.
[1711.26 → 1712.26] They're super creative.
[1712.30 → 1717.52] Even touch ID, which Apple claims is like an order of magnitude less secure than face
[1717.52 → 1717.76] ID.
[1718.22 → 1720.84] Even that one, it sensed like the heat of your thumb.
[1721.04 → 1726.34] So if you'd been dead for more than like a couple of hours or a day, they couldn't unlock
[1726.34 → 1727.20] your phone with your body.
[1727.36 → 1727.58] Yeah.
[1727.64 → 1731.98] You can do that slightly artificially by like external heating and all this other junk, but
[1731.98 → 1733.82] like it's, it's not that easy.
[1733.98 → 1737.90] It's a lot harder than just like, you know what I mean?
[1737.94 → 1743.64] Like it's, yeah, it's, there's always going to be a way to get through some form of security.
[1743.78 → 1747.80] Nothing is 100% secure, but like, it's kind of sad.
[1747.94 → 1749.02] This has already been done.
[1749.02 → 1753.80] And it's kind of, it's interesting because cameras on stuff like phones are constantly
[1753.80 → 1757.26] getting better, and they're constantly starting to implement things like depth scanning and
[1757.26 → 1758.08] all this other stuff.
[1758.08 → 1763.76] So we're going to get closer and closer progressively to breaking through this being easier and easier.
[1763.88 → 1768.00] The security on this gets worse over time, unless they're actively improving it.
[1768.32 → 1769.82] And we'll have to fight against that.
[1769.84 → 1770.34] It does improve.
[1770.34 → 1770.80] It does improve itself.
[1771.02 → 1772.30] As you use it more and more.
[1772.36 → 1772.52] Yeah.
[1772.56 → 1777.66] Like I've heard of people being locked out when they put their glasses on, and it had, when
[1777.66 → 1780.64] they did the initial scan, they weren't wearing glasses or their hair wasn't in their face.
[1780.68 → 1781.74] So then it locks you out.
[1781.88 → 1782.78] You enter your code.
[1782.78 → 1787.20] And when you enter your code, it's like, oh, the model that we just took, like you with
[1787.20 → 1789.10] glasses on, we're going to add that to the model now.
[1789.70 → 1791.16] So that's, that's just annoying.
[1791.60 → 1795.40] That's expanding the model, but it's not necessarily making it more secure.
[1795.86 → 1799.08] Like, see, like the having hair in your face and stuff is just annoying.
[1799.36 → 1800.86] I don't, I don't want to deal with any of this stuff.
[1800.86 → 1801.68] Because it gets in your eyes?
[1801.92 → 1802.50] Well, no.
[1803.80 → 1804.36] Good call.
[1804.46 → 1804.80] Good call.
[1804.80 → 1810.04] But like, like with touch ID, if I just like with mine, it's not touch ID, but I have a
[1810.04 → 1811.00] fingerprint sensor on the back.
[1811.54 → 1812.76] It doesn't matter what situation I'm in.
[1812.96 → 1814.24] I could be completely covered in mud.
[1814.68 → 1818.18] If I just like wipe my finger off real quick and go burp, I get in my phone.
[1818.64 → 1818.76] Yeah.
[1818.78 → 1819.88] Well, you still got the passcode.
[1820.20 → 1824.36] And that, but like, it's just, I don't know, but it's pretty sick that like, I can't
[1824.36 → 1825.38] even remember the last time you used a passcode.
[1825.38 → 1827.02] That's still an action that you're taking, right?
[1827.08 → 1830.60] You're deciding, granted that it's muscle memory that you do automatically after a while.
[1830.60 → 1830.88] Yeah.
[1830.88 → 1836.86] You're still taking an action to unlock your phone, whereas Apple is pursuing a time when
[1836.86 → 1839.58] you just kind of go like, do not, no, you don't even do that.
[1839.66 → 1843.02] You're just like, look, like by the time you look at your phone, it's unlocked.
[1843.38 → 1844.04] That's sick.
[1844.28 → 1845.80] So they're like trying to get there, I guess.
[1845.82 → 1846.90] They should be aspiring to that.
[1846.96 → 1849.22] That's because that's optimal use case as long as it's secure.
[1849.60 → 1850.66] It's not there yet though.
[1851.36 → 1851.76] Evidently.
[1851.94 → 1854.54] It's slower than touch ID, which is frustrating.
[1855.46 → 1856.78] Fingerprint is pretty insecure though.
[1856.86 → 1856.98] Yeah.
[1856.98 → 1857.92] It has a lot of issues too.
[1857.92 → 1859.78] It's like one in 50,000 or something like that.
[1860.88 → 1861.60] Yeah.
[1862.00 → 1863.90] It's like, I don't know.
[1868.00 → 1869.96] There are a bunch of problems with their methodologies here.
[1870.04 → 1872.54] So the story is absurdly short-sighted.
[1872.84 → 1874.70] Is there though?
[1874.76 → 1881.00] Because some people were saying that it's possible that when they registered their face, they had
[1881.00 → 1885.30] their face obscured or something like that, or tried to make their face kind of more like
[1885.30 → 1887.98] the mask so that they were more similar.
[1887.98 → 1888.46] Yeah.
[1888.62 → 1892.12] But they, and there hasn't been, there's no way to verify that.
[1892.32 → 1897.52] But the researchers did say that they made four other masks that didn't work.
[1897.86 → 1903.26] And once those failed, they re-registered, re-registered their face on the face ID.
[1903.50 → 1909.28] And that after registering their face, they didn't do any passcode entries to update it.
[1909.80 → 1910.60] That's what they say.
[1910.60 → 1911.04] Yeah.
[1912.16 → 1912.68] I don't know.
[1913.06 → 1920.00] If nothing else, all I really want this to stand for is to reinforce that anything can
[1920.00 → 1920.74] be broken into.
[1922.16 → 1925.46] No one should ever consider anything absolutely secure.
[1926.22 → 1928.02] This might be better.
[1928.26 → 1929.80] I don't necessarily think it's easier.
[1930.38 → 1932.88] When I go to, I always use my phone when it's in my hand.
[1932.96 → 1935.02] I never go like, I'm going to look at it while it's on the table.
[1935.02 → 1936.52] Um, so.
[1936.82 → 1937.22] Linus does.
[1937.38 → 1940.22] We talked about this once, and he was like, he hated that the fingerprint things were on
[1940.22 → 1943.34] the back because he often wants to like just unlock it when it's on the table.
[1943.54 → 1943.62] Yeah.
[1943.76 → 1944.56] He's told me that.
[1944.66 → 1945.22] I don't, I don't do that.
[1945.22 → 1947.00] I just heard a lot of boo, Hoo, Hoo.
[1947.16 → 1949.02] And I was like, that doesn't apply to me.
[1949.04 → 1949.28] Whatever.
[1949.40 → 1950.06] I don't care about that.
[1950.14 → 1950.96] Doesn't apply to me either.
[1951.08 → 1954.92] So like, and it's become a natural part of picking up the phone to unlock it.
[1955.04 → 1955.42] Oh yeah.
[1955.42 → 1957.14] It's unlocked by the time you get to it.
[1957.22 → 1957.46] Yeah.
[1957.46 → 1961.96] So the speed thing doesn't help for me personally and face ID is slower.
[1961.96 → 1965.00] Ed's over there mad because he's an Apple user, and he just doesn't know what it's like
[1965.00 → 1966.58] to have that fingerprint reader on the back.
[1967.12 → 1968.04] Do you have a 10?
[1968.20 → 1968.82] Gravy baby.
[1969.12 → 1969.30] What?
[1969.58 → 1970.30] Do you have a 10?
[1970.38 → 1970.56] No.
[1970.74 → 1970.96] No?
[1971.04 → 1971.46] I wish.
[1971.94 → 1972.54] You wish.
[1972.56 → 1973.56] It's the perfect phone.
[1974.02 → 1975.24] He says it's the perfect phone.
[1975.24 → 1977.34] It's probably the pinnacle of phone technology.
[1977.34 → 1981.08] I don't think anyone's going to make anything better after this.
[1981.26 → 1981.60] Even Apple.
[1982.28 → 1982.94] Yeah, maybe.
[1983.04 → 1983.92] This is the end.
[1984.44 → 1985.16] Maybe it is the end.
[1985.16 → 1990.28] I don't know if you guys can hear that, but just in case any of you missed it, that was
[1990.28 → 1990.88] sarcasm.
[1991.74 → 1993.00] It's a fantastic tool.
[1993.52 → 1995.46] But yeah, I don't know.
[1996.26 → 2000.72] I just don't like it for a lot of reasons personally, but if you do like it, that's great.
[2000.90 → 2001.36] Run with it.
[2001.48 → 2002.18] Do whatever you want.
[2002.28 → 2003.38] Personal preferences are awesome.
[2003.54 → 2006.42] Just do know that nothing is completely secure.
[2006.86 → 2010.82] We should also mention that the fact that you can scan someone's face and then make a
[2010.82 → 2014.12] mask and unlock their phone, that's like espionage level packing.
[2014.12 → 2014.52] Yeah.
[2014.78 → 2019.74] It's more likely they're just going to run by you and grab it or grab it and then choke
[2019.74 → 2023.82] hold you and make your face look at it and then run away or steal your phone and go,
[2023.90 → 2024.56] hey, is this your phone?
[2024.72 → 2025.44] And then you look at it.
[2025.48 → 2025.90] Yeah, it is.
[2026.08 → 2026.64] And then they run.
[2029.20 → 2029.56] Thanks.
[2032.18 → 2034.28] That would actually work way too well.
[2034.32 → 2034.80] That's pretty good, eh?
[2034.80 → 2038.88] If a guy with a balaclava comes up to you and says, is this your phone?
[2038.88 → 2039.42] Is this your phone?
[2039.76 → 2039.92] Go.
[2039.92 → 2040.24] Don't.
[2040.40 → 2040.64] No.
[2042.02 → 2042.68] Turn it over.
[2045.76 → 2049.26] So everyone's going to have to carry around masks so that if they have to chase someone
[2049.26 → 2050.84] who steals their phone, they can put the mask on.
[2050.84 → 2052.26] The solution to this is more masks.
[2052.36 → 2052.68] Yes.
[2053.14 → 2053.44] Yeah.
[2053.86 → 2055.72] Take those laws away that we can't wear masks.
[2055.84 → 2058.96] Everyone has to wear a mask so that when they go to unlock their phone, they just go,
[2059.38 → 2059.52] huh?
[2059.52 → 2060.48] And then put it back down.
[2060.48 → 2060.56] Yeah.
[2060.62 → 2063.46] It just occurred to me that there's going to be people in the Middle East who want to
[2063.46 → 2064.24] use face unlock.
[2065.00 → 2069.02] Do they just not use face unlock?
[2069.42 → 2070.58] Do they just only use it at home?
[2070.68 → 2071.18] Use a passport?
[2071.50 → 2072.74] Or just use the passcode.
[2072.74 → 2073.16] In public?
[2074.26 → 2074.50] Yeah.
[2075.08 → 2075.78] Never thought of that.
[2077.22 → 2077.54] Yeah.
[2078.36 → 2079.16] Moving on.
[2079.28 → 2079.72] Anyway.
[2079.88 → 2080.14] Okay.
[2080.14 → 2082.42] Last night, I got to watch this awesome live stream.
[2082.70 → 2083.14] Oh.
[2083.44 → 2084.28] Of Elon Musk.
[2086.10 → 2087.16] It can't be Elon.
[2088.16 → 2089.28] Did you really say Elon?
[2089.94 → 2090.14] What?
[2090.56 → 2091.86] Elon Musk Degenerates.
[2092.46 → 2094.88] They had a child together, and they hyphenated the last name.
[2095.10 → 2095.50] Oh.
[2097.02 → 2099.10] That, like, that hurt physically.
[2100.30 → 2101.52] Oh, I need a moment.
[2101.66 → 2102.06] Anyway.
[2102.20 → 2102.44] Okay.
[2102.70 → 2102.92] So.
[2103.26 → 2104.32] No, I was going to say no, it's Elon.
[2105.00 → 2105.34] Yeah.
[2105.48 → 2107.40] They finally unveiled the semi truck.
[2107.94 → 2108.38] Yes.
[2108.78 → 2110.94] Which I think is pretty B.A.
[2110.94 → 2116.14] The question on everyone's mind is, when and where are you going to be able to make these
[2116.14 → 2121.68] things, given that you're struggling so hard to produce the Model 3 for the next, like,
[2121.72 → 2122.32] two years.
[2123.00 → 2127.10] And you're spending a billion dollars per quarter on doing that.
[2127.10 → 2128.96] You can't just build another gigafactory.
[2129.62 → 2132.44] Apparently, they're going to start shipping or not shipping.
[2132.64 → 2135.18] They're going to start producing the semi truck in 2019.
[2135.62 → 2135.76] Yeah.
[2135.76 → 2140.38] And the new Roadster, which is going to be the fastest car, fastest production car by acceleration
[2140.38 → 2141.06] in the world.
[2141.38 → 2142.08] That's 2020.
[2142.08 → 2142.84] Yeah.
[2143.36 → 2147.68] So, things could happen before 2020 and change that claim.
[2147.98 → 2151.46] But as of right now, it theoretically is, which is really cool.
[2151.90 → 2156.68] There are a lot of really awesome things about the truck, but there are concerns.
[2156.68 → 2158.84] Like you just said, how are you going to make this?
[2159.04 → 2162.64] I do know their production lines are constantly increasing.
[2163.46 → 2170.18] So, maybe a theory somewhere says that they'll be able to actually make them properly by 2019.
[2170.18 → 2172.66] Maybe one will be made in 2019.
[2172.96 → 2174.96] Aren't they making two more gigafactories as well?
[2175.32 → 2176.88] They're constantly expanding.
[2177.34 → 2185.06] So, I can't claim to know what is going to happen in terms of their production line.
[2186.08 → 2188.04] Semi truck itself is pretty dope, though.
[2188.44 → 2189.06] Did you check it out?
[2189.46 → 2190.34] It looks cool.
[2190.44 → 2191.36] It looks pretty cool.
[2191.36 → 2196.96] And I've been saying for quite a long time that semi trucks and trucks in general are going
[2196.96 → 2203.04] to be super important for Tesla because trucks, things that need huge amounts of torque, are
[2203.04 → 2205.60] going to benefit from electric engines a ton.
[2205.80 → 2207.10] Now, there are some issues.
[2207.44 → 2214.08] Coming from the trucking industry, like my grandfather, his job, actually, for like basically
[2214.08 → 2219.56] ever was financing semi trucks for people and companies that want to get into trucking.
[2219.56 → 2226.18] So, a super important detail is cost per kilometre or cost per mile.
[2226.40 → 2228.58] And they talked about that in the stream.
[2229.36 → 2234.70] That was a direct call-out for companies and financial institutions that finance these semi
[2234.70 → 2236.30] trucks because they're extremely expensive.
[2236.70 → 2238.68] That was a direct, hey, look at us.
[2238.92 → 2243.02] It's going to be easier to get loans because you can throw this number, which is one of the
[2243.02 → 2245.20] most important numbers when you're buying a truck.
[2245.20 → 2247.26] That is, it is cheaper per kilometre.
[2247.46 → 2252.28] You can also throw in numbers, like the truck is guaranteed for whatever amount of distance
[2252.28 → 2253.88] if you have a breakdown.
[2254.60 → 2256.36] It's some ridiculous number.
[2257.62 → 2258.30] Oh, yeah, yeah.
[2258.32 → 2258.82] What was that?
[2258.94 → 2259.70] If you have a break.
[2259.88 → 2260.16] Oh, yeah.
[2260.24 → 2264.76] What happened was it's got four separate independent engines and two of them can break down and
[2264.76 → 2267.40] you can still go like 400 miles or something like that.
[2267.90 → 2268.24] Yeah.
[2268.64 → 2269.96] It's not in this document.
[2270.52 → 2270.80] Okay.
[2270.94 → 2274.48] By the way, speaking of price, they did not mention an absolute price at all.
[2274.48 → 2278.26] They only mentioned price per mile, which they put at 20% cheaper.
[2278.42 → 2279.38] Again, it was only relative.
[2279.70 → 2284.00] 20% cheaper than a comparable diesel truck.
[2284.20 → 2286.48] It includes the cost of the...
[2287.04 → 2288.40] They're not just talking about the truck.
[2288.50 → 2292.50] They're talking about like the entire thing, like buying it and insurance and operating it
[2292.50 → 2293.52] and maintenance.
[2294.96 → 2297.36] Maintenance is going to be a big reason why that number is lower.
[2297.54 → 2297.92] Yeah, yeah.
[2297.92 → 2299.18] I'm just going to put that out there right now.
[2299.48 → 2303.02] Another huge issue, only goes 500 miles on one charge.
[2303.02 → 2306.66] Uh, the only there is probably not properly placed.
[2306.80 → 2307.94] Someone in chat said only.
[2307.94 → 2310.96] Most trucking routes are able to be there and back within that time.
[2311.22 → 2314.86] And truckers are mandated to take breaks.
[2315.26 → 2319.10] Um, that is a huge deal in, I know, North America.
[2319.18 → 2320.12] I don't know outside of that.
[2320.50 → 2322.60] Um, you have to take breaks.
[2322.60 → 2329.64] And that is within the amount of distance that you would be able to reasonably travel within one of your breaks easily.
[2329.64 → 2331.22] Your break has to be half an hour.
[2331.46 → 2334.88] During the break, it can charge for 500 miles of further distance...
[2334.88 → 2337.70] Or 400 miles of further distance during that break.
[2337.78 → 2338.76] And you'd be able to keep going.
[2340.38 → 2342.20] That's not really a major point.
[2342.26 → 2344.10] As long as they actually have the...
[2344.10 → 2345.64] I think they're called supercharging stations.
[2345.70 → 2347.64] I think actually he dropped megacharger.
[2348.60 → 2348.96] Megacharger.
[2349.12 → 2349.84] Yeah, megacharging stations.
[2349.84 → 2352.12] Sounds like it's going to be like a separate kind of network.
[2352.24 → 2355.64] I'm thinking of it kind of the same way you drive by a card lock gas station.
[2356.16 → 2356.64] Oh, yeah.
[2356.68 → 2357.06] You know what I mean?
[2357.06 → 2358.18] It's like, oh, that's for semis.
[2358.32 → 2359.72] It's going to have to be like that.
[2359.82 → 2361.72] I wouldn't be surprised if it was kind of its own thing.
[2361.78 → 2365.66] So a typical diesel truck can go a thousand miles on a full tank.
[2365.78 → 2367.84] Do you know how long it takes to fill up that tank?
[2368.28 → 2369.40] When you're standing there filling it up?
[2369.56 → 2371.60] I think he said 15 minutes.
[2371.86 → 2372.14] No, no.
[2372.18 → 2374.04] I'm talking about like a normal diesel truck.
[2374.36 → 2374.72] Oh!
[2375.12 → 2376.74] It'll take a while to fill that puppy up.
[2377.40 → 2378.88] I assume it would take a little while.
[2379.04 → 2380.98] It's going to take longer to charge this truck.
[2381.28 → 2385.12] But one of his points was that you don't have to stand there the whole time, I guess.
[2385.12 → 2388.40] It is definitely going to take longer to charge it.
[2388.50 → 2392.14] But I don't think there's going to be a bunch of truck drivers leaning against their truck
[2392.14 → 2397.14] while it sips electricity or gulps, I guess, electricity from the network.
[2398.00 → 2405.12] He also talked about a guaranteed price for semi-trucks at seven cents per...
[2405.64 → 2406.58] What unit would that be?
[2406.58 → 2406.92] Kilowatt?
[2406.96 → 2408.88] I don't remember exactly what they used.
[2409.12 → 2409.84] Is that also in here?
[2409.84 → 2410.40] Must be kilowatt.
[2410.40 → 2413.30] That's not in the document either, but he did.
[2413.48 → 2414.66] He had a guaranteed price.
[2414.82 → 2415.56] Which is a big deal.
[2415.86 → 2419.64] Also a big deal in terms of getting financial support for trucks.
[2419.84 → 2422.14] One big question that I haven't...
[2422.14 → 2423.22] I'm sure...
[2423.22 → 2423.38] Okay.
[2423.94 → 2427.38] I haven't seen anyone ask it, but I am absolutely certain someone has.
[2427.78 → 2428.46] So...
[2428.46 → 2429.28] And I haven't looked.
[2429.54 → 2431.70] So that's kind of an issue that I haven't looked for it.
[2431.90 → 2433.70] But a big problem is going to be weight.
[2434.50 → 2435.86] They didn't talk about it on the stream.
[2435.86 → 2441.36] And there are a lot of weighing stations for trucks because roads can only support a certain amount of weight.
[2441.50 → 2443.40] And the batteries are going to weigh a lot.
[2443.54 → 2444.48] I did see this, yeah.
[2444.64 → 2451.68] I think naked, it is going to be heavier than a naked normal diesel truck.
[2451.68 → 2453.12] I think that's going to be a big issue.
[2453.24 → 2455.50] There's weighing stations like all over the place.
[2456.88 → 2458.22] They did not address that.
[2459.74 → 2461.20] Did you see the cockpit design?
[2461.20 → 2465.24] Yeah, so it's 500 miles with 32.2 tons of cargo.
[2465.38 → 2466.56] So at max capacity.
[2467.10 → 2468.22] Is that the heaviest class?
[2469.10 → 2472.00] A lot of the stats he gave out were for the heaviest class of truck.
[2472.38 → 2474.76] Like the speed and the range and everything.
[2475.80 → 2476.20] So...
[2477.16 → 2478.94] The lack of engine might compensate for that.
[2479.40 → 2483.40] Yeah, but if you look at the Model S, it's actually a pretty heavy car.
[2484.50 → 2486.40] Because of the battery and all that other stuff.
[2486.42 → 2487.52] You have to do more than look at it.
[2487.52 → 2488.56] You probably have to try to lift it.
[2488.56 → 2493.44] But apparently weigh stations are for trailer load and balance, not total load.
[2493.56 → 2493.72] Oh!
[2495.42 → 2495.82] Okay.
[2496.04 → 2496.86] We have some really...
[2496.86 → 2497.56] We just got everyone.
[2497.70 → 2498.40] All kinds in that.
[2498.40 → 2500.36] Now someone said weigh stations are for total weight.
[2500.62 → 2501.22] Who knows?
[2501.66 → 2502.26] I just...
[2502.26 → 2504.82] It wasn't addressed in the stream, and it made me worry a little bit.
[2504.94 → 2506.52] But this will be huge.
[2506.60 → 2509.20] Another big thing that they brought up was convoy mode.
[2509.30 → 2511.12] This isn't the first time we've seen convoy mode.
[2511.72 → 2514.60] I've been in a car that was doing convoy mode before.
[2515.38 → 2516.26] You've been in a convoy?
[2516.26 → 2517.10] I have...
[2517.10 → 2517.74] Convoy!
[2519.18 → 2526.00] But essentially, the cost per mile or per kilometre goes down drastically when you have
[2526.00 → 2527.16] these trucks in convoy mode.
[2527.28 → 2528.26] I believe...
[2528.26 → 2530.18] I don't think he went over it in exhaustive detail.
[2530.32 → 2534.54] But I believe because they talk to each other, and they can run really closely together.
[2534.70 → 2535.92] Drafting very efficiently.
[2536.04 → 2536.18] Okay.
[2536.26 → 2539.56] So I didn't hear this from the stream last night.
[2539.74 → 2541.16] But it was in the article I read today.
[2541.16 → 2541.80] Okay.
[2541.88 → 2543.12] They said that in convoy...
[2543.12 → 2546.12] The reason convoy mode is so much cheaper...
[2546.12 → 2548.72] In fact, Musk said it was cheaper than rail.
[2549.14 → 2549.82] Yes, apparently.
[2550.60 → 2551.76] But he didn't show the rail number.
[2551.94 → 2554.08] You only need a driver in the front truck.
[2554.98 → 2555.38] Okay.
[2555.54 → 2555.94] Yes.
[2556.80 → 2557.76] That's a thing.
[2557.86 → 2558.24] Is that...
[2558.24 → 2559.98] Well, they even showed it in the animation.
[2560.14 → 2561.26] There was a person in the front truck.
[2561.34 → 2563.02] There's no people in the ones following it.
[2563.26 → 2564.62] That was a very important note.
[2564.76 → 2565.34] That's crazy.
[2566.22 → 2567.06] But is that...
[2567.06 → 2569.28] So did they bake in the cost of the driver?
[2569.90 → 2570.26] Definitely.
[2570.64 → 2571.44] They must have.
[2571.92 → 2572.92] Otherwise, that doesn't matter.
[2573.42 → 2573.78] So...
[2573.78 → 2580.86] But I mean, in the initial Tesla semi versus diesel semi comparison, was the cost of the
[2580.86 → 2581.00] driver...
[2581.00 → 2581.32] No, no, no.
[2581.44 → 2582.10] I don't think so.
[2582.18 → 2586.72] Because in the second number, when he said in convoy mode, he was comparing those against
[2586.72 → 2588.30] the other ones, not against train.
[2588.48 → 2590.40] And he said it was like 80 cents or something.
[2591.12 → 2594.14] I would think at that comparison, I mean, it's a company.
[2594.14 → 2596.60] They're going to make their numbers look as good as they can.
[2596.78 → 2601.54] I would assume that they'd be like, yeah, but it's like, you know, two thirds cheaper
[2601.54 → 2602.96] because there's only one driver involved.
[2603.52 → 2606.92] And that is a realistic consideration if you're dispatching those trucks.
[2606.92 → 2607.46] Well, yeah.
[2609.66 → 2611.00] Mostly, I think.
[2611.36 → 2617.62] I wonder how they're going to accomplish this because convoy mode makes sense for highways,
[2617.86 → 2618.82] which is what they showed it on.
[2618.90 → 2620.34] But the second you get to a city...
[2620.34 → 2620.36] Exactly.
[2620.50 → 2623.32] You're not going to be able to convoy for the entire trip.
[2623.60 → 2623.86] Yeah.
[2624.14 → 2625.42] You're going to have to turn off at something, right?
[2625.42 → 2627.62] So what do you do for the rest of the drivers?
[2628.16 → 2630.38] Well, they are getting their enhanced autopilot.
[2630.38 → 2631.58] I missed this.
[2631.68 → 2633.38] Maybe Twitch chat knows what's going on.
[2634.18 → 2635.44] Enhanced autopilot's there, definitely.
[2635.44 → 2635.96] For all of them.
[2636.12 → 2636.24] Yeah.
[2636.24 → 2640.94] And if this is like one to two years out, maybe it'll be even better by then.
[2642.28 → 2646.52] Elon did not avoid talking about autopilot.
[2646.98 → 2648.74] He brought it up directly in the stream.
[2648.74 → 2651.74] He said that they would have all their most modern...
[2652.38 → 2653.60] Yeah, that's true.
[2653.70 → 2654.56] But he didn't say that.
[2654.68 → 2655.72] He may not have...
[2655.72 → 2659.24] What they're saying doesn't address our question of whether he said that about convoy
[2659.24 → 2659.48] mode.
[2660.02 → 2660.36] Oh.
[2660.68 → 2660.80] Oh, yeah.
[2660.80 → 2663.80] Elon did say that they're all going to get an enhanced autopilot for sure.
[2664.20 → 2664.46] Yeah.
[2664.46 → 2669.78] In the video, there isn't drivers in the trucks behind the first one.
[2669.78 → 2670.00] Okay.
[2670.04 → 2670.68] I didn't notice that.
[2670.76 → 2671.42] So that's good.
[2673.58 → 2673.94] Yeah.
[2674.60 → 2675.76] It's going to be interesting.
[2677.24 → 2678.36] Does it have air brakes?
[2679.70 → 2680.96] Oh, it has the...
[2680.96 → 2682.94] He did talk about braking a bit because it's got the...
[2682.94 → 2683.54] You never have to repair some.
[2683.54 → 2685.40] It has the regenerative braking.
[2685.40 → 2690.76] So I was actually at a Tesla Diva ship the other day, and I was asking if with the regenerative
[2690.76 → 2693.46] braking, can you coast just as well as you can?
[2693.46 → 2696.50] Because for me, when I'm driving, I actually coast quite a bit.
[2696.76 → 2696.82] Yeah.
[2697.60 → 2701.54] And he told me, as a person who's never driven a Tesla, he said, actually, you can't really
[2701.54 → 2703.72] coast worth a crap when the regenerative braking is on.
[2703.74 → 2705.32] It slows you down pretty fast.
[2705.36 → 2705.50] Yeah.
[2705.66 → 2708.48] But the upside of that is you barely ever have to use your brake pads.
[2708.48 → 2709.16] You almost never need a brake.
[2709.66 → 2710.66] Which is what he said here.
[2710.68 → 2712.80] He didn't say anything about air brakes.
[2713.86 → 2714.78] Would that even work?
[2715.92 → 2722.58] I don't have a very good understanding of how semi-trucks work, but I don't think it would
[2722.58 → 2722.84] work.
[2723.46 → 2723.86] Anyway.
[2724.00 → 2724.88] What about that Roadster, though?
[2725.32 → 2725.96] The Roadster.
[2726.06 → 2726.16] Yeah.
[2726.20 → 2727.10] I guess we can move on to that.
[2727.10 → 2730.86] At the end of the whole semi-truck thing, it was kind of like a one more thing moment.
[2731.12 → 2731.24] Yeah.
[2731.26 → 2738.24] And they popped open the hatch and a new Tesla Roadster drove out of the back of the trailer
[2738.24 → 2739.62] that the semi-truck was towing.
[2739.76 → 2742.36] It can do 0 to 60 in 1.9 seconds.
[2742.36 → 2746.18] It can do 0 to 100 in, I believe, 4.9.
[2746.26 → 2747.10] I don't see that on here.
[2747.14 → 2752.90] I didn't see that, but I actually do have a list of linked Wikipedia of the fastest zero
[2752.90 → 2753.60] second speeds.
[2753.82 → 2757.94] And I was like, oh, I wonder if they killed some records from other super expensive cars.
[2757.94 → 2760.90] Well, they kind of just beat their own record.
[2761.08 → 2761.24] Yeah.
[2761.74 → 2762.22] Yeah.
[2762.60 → 2762.82] Yeah.
[2763.22 → 2763.74] It's awesome.
[2763.74 → 2769.22] It can go 620 miles or 1,000 kilometres on a single charge.
[2769.32 → 2772.90] He was happy because they broke the 1,000 kilometre ceiling, which is pretty cool.
[2773.06 → 2773.64] And it seats four.
[2774.14 → 2774.62] Yeah.
[2774.72 → 2775.54] It's a two plus two.
[2775.70 → 2777.12] Production starts in 2020.
[2777.60 → 2782.78] The first 1,000 cars will cost 250 grand each.
[2783.12 → 2784.68] Paid in full up front.
[2785.72 → 2785.96] Woo.
[2786.12 → 2788.42] With later cars starting at 200 grand.
[2788.42 → 2792.60] So presumably the first 1,000 they're going to sell are going to be the tricked out ones.
[2792.64 → 2792.86] Yeah.
[2793.22 → 2793.36] Yeah.
[2793.44 → 2794.40] Which makes a lot of sense.
[2795.16 → 2796.26] I love this quote.
[2796.64 → 2800.68] Elon said, and his stuttering is removed from this quote.
[2801.82 → 2802.72] Come on.
[2803.26 → 2804.04] Come on.
[2804.06 → 2808.26] He said, the point of doing this is just to give a hardcore smackdown to gasoline cars.
[2808.44 → 2813.00] Driving a gasoline sports car is going to feel like a steam engine with a side of quiche.
[2814.14 → 2814.76] That's wicked.
[2815.00 → 2815.76] That was pretty funny.
[2815.76 → 2820.18] We'll just take the voice crack out of when people quote yours.
[2821.64 → 2822.04] Harsh.
[2822.98 → 2823.38] Okay.
[2823.48 → 2824.38] I deserve some harshness.
[2824.44 → 2824.96] I love you, Elon.
[2825.42 → 2825.78] Yeah.
[2825.82 → 2826.36] I was just kidding.
[2826.50 → 2828.66] He speaks that way because he uses a particular language.
[2829.16 → 2830.64] He's very careful about his words.
[2831.26 → 2834.22] Anyway, moving on to someone in the chat guessed it.
[2835.02 → 2835.38] Sponsors.
[2835.58 → 2835.86] Maybe.
[2836.12 → 2836.90] Thank you very much.
[2837.02 → 2837.42] Heck yeah.
[2837.56 → 2838.22] I fix it.
[2838.28 → 2838.58] Thank you.
[2838.58 → 2840.00] Someone in the chat is like, I love that.
[2840.46 → 2840.82] Please.
[2841.44 → 2842.72] Please make them show up.
[2842.72 → 2843.42] I fix it.
[2843.42 → 2846.12] This $59.95 Protect Toolkit.
[2846.20 → 2846.82] It's awesome.
[2847.14 → 2852.70] It's a 64-bit driver kit, which is easily my favourite part and probably the mainstay feature
[2852.70 → 2854.64] of someone took the driver.
[2854.76 → 2855.42] That's how good it is.
[2855.48 → 2855.98] It's just that awesome.
[2856.20 → 2856.32] Yeah.
[2856.32 → 2863.62] It has a ton of other stuff in it as well, including little tweezers and pry tools and
[2863.62 → 2864.90] anti-static strap.
[2865.06 → 2866.48] Which we use here all the time.
[2866.96 → 2867.20] Yeah.
[2867.66 → 2873.90] And suction cups for taking screens off of things, which is a major issue with very specific
[2873.90 → 2874.52] devices.
[2876.52 → 2878.06] ESD safe tweezers even.
[2878.26 → 2879.78] I forgot to mention that part.
[2879.78 → 2884.20] But also, if you just want some awesome free guides on how to fix things, which does include
[2884.20 → 2887.64] the use of their kit, you can just go to ifixit.com.
[2887.68 → 2890.82] They have 25,000 free repair guides for devices.
[2890.98 → 2893.58] They also do repairability scores.
[2893.84 → 2898.14] So if you're interested in buying something, you can check into how repairable it is so you
[2898.14 → 2901.74] know if it's going to have a long life because you yourself are going to be able to fix it,
[2901.82 → 2903.50] which is actually really cool.
[2903.60 → 2904.58] They're like their own movement.
[2905.28 → 2905.82] Sort of, actually.
[2905.82 → 2906.48] They're like a culture.
[2906.82 → 2912.14] Bringing repairability and craftsman traits back to society because it's kind of faltered
[2912.14 → 2912.82] a little bit lately.
[2912.96 → 2913.72] Anyway, moving on.
[2914.10 → 2915.66] Ifixit.com slash Linus.
[2915.96 → 2919.08] Get your Protect toolkit now for $59.95 USD.
[2920.20 → 2920.98] Moving on.
[2921.18 → 2921.72] Mack Weldon.
[2921.84 → 2923.82] I am wearing a Mack Weldon shirt.
[2926.20 → 2926.64] Damn.
[2927.46 → 2928.64] Damn, that's a good shirt.
[2928.76 → 2932.28] I wish my shirt that's not Mack Weldon had a front pocket that I could hang these in.
[2933.06 → 2933.56] I could.
[2933.88 → 2934.70] Now they're on the floor.
[2934.70 → 2940.86] Anyway, Mack Weldon believes in smart design, premium fabrics, and simple shopping, which
[2940.86 → 2941.30] is great.
[2941.38 → 2944.26] It's actually, it is quite a simple shopping experience, which is not too bad.
[2944.52 → 2949.34] Mack Weldon will be the most comfortable underwear, socks, shirts, undershirts, hoodies, and sweatpants
[2949.34 → 2950.96] that you will ever wear.
[2951.96 → 2952.36] Wow.
[2952.98 → 2953.56] What a claim.
[2953.76 → 2955.84] Even if you're not a nudist, and you do wear other stuff.
[2956.12 → 2956.32] Yeah.
[2956.40 → 2957.12] This will still be better.
[2957.38 → 2957.60] Yeah.
[2957.94 → 2958.92] They want you to be comfortable.
[2959.14 → 2962.16] So if you don't like your first pair, you can keep it, and they will still refund you
[2962.16 → 2966.28] no questions asked, which is pretty major for a claim to be made from a company.
[2966.56 → 2967.36] You can try it out.
[2967.54 → 2968.14] No big deal.
[2968.52 → 2972.02] Which is probably fair because you probably don't want to send your underwear back because
[2972.02 → 2973.28] that would sort of be weird.
[2973.74 → 2975.00] Go to MackWeldon.com.
[2975.06 → 2980.28] Get 20% off using promo code TECHNICS and get some clothing today.
[2980.28 → 2983.10] Moving on.
[2983.38 → 2984.22] Total giveaway.
[2985.12 → 2988.18] I'm going to get you to Anna White this box.
[2988.98 → 2989.56] There you go.
[2990.40 → 2992.96] Our holiday giveaway with Total is still happening.
[2993.08 → 2995.72] We announced this on the WAN show a little bit ago, just in case you didn't know.
[2995.98 → 2999.62] They're giving away three different models of their Box Mini PCs.
[3000.44 → 3003.54] One of them is the PI225.
[3003.96 → 3009.74] It is a desktop performance and mobile flexibility crammed into a PC the size of a 2.5 inch SSD.
[3010.06 → 3010.88] It is tiny.
[3011.10 → 3012.92] This thing is absolutely miniature.
[3013.26 → 3013.90] Really cool.
[3014.02 → 3015.00] There's a computer in this box?
[3015.40 → 3016.04] In that one, yes.
[3017.00 → 3018.62] That is not the tiny one that I'm talking about.
[3018.84 → 3020.26] That's more like gaming focus.
[3020.40 → 3021.48] VR ready sticker?
[3021.60 → 3026.66] There's a gaming ready, VR ready computer in this box?
[3026.76 → 3027.14] Yes, sir.
[3027.46 → 3028.26] Yes, ladies and James.
[3028.62 → 3029.38] Ladies and James.
[3030.36 → 3032.04] I meant to say Laser James.
[3032.14 → 3032.42] My bad.
[3032.46 → 3034.32] Ladies and James, there is a computer in this box.
[3035.32 → 3038.50] It has a bunch of great features, which is actually fantastic.
[3038.60 → 3040.48] Moving on, we have the MI553.
[3040.74 → 3043.30] Great for multipurpose utility kind of setups.
[3043.76 → 3045.28] And then we have the Box.
[3045.54 → 3046.38] I believe it's this one.
[3046.46 → 3046.68] Yes.
[3047.90 → 3049.08] EN1070K-U.
[3049.20 → 3054.26] How is it that this is more BA than consoles and smaller?
[3054.60 → 3055.00] Oh, owned.
[3055.18 → 3056.26] Get it together, consoles.
[3056.54 → 3056.74] Oh, owned.
[3057.54 → 3060.68] It has a Core i5-7500T.
[3060.90 → 3068.10] It has an NVIDIA GTX 1060 or GTX 1070, depending on which configuration you select.
[3068.54 → 3069.96] It's, yeah, it's great.
[3069.96 → 3074.18] The Box giveaway is at a little bit of a funky link.
[3074.90 → 3076.18] Oh, I didn't click on the right thing.
[3076.38 → 3076.78] Here we go.
[3077.08 → 3082.94] The Box giveaway is on a little bit of a funky link, which I will try to post in the Twitch
[3082.94 → 3084.04] chat right now.
[3084.04 → 3085.88] Oh, is this going to be a problem?
[3085.88 → 3089.44] Why get an Xbox when you can have a Box?
[3090.72 → 3095.56] If you want to enter the giveaway, check out gleam.io slash wow.
[3095.56 → 3102.20] Uh, MSF slash total dash box dash mini dash pc dash giveaway.
[3102.62 → 3104.48] And you can enter there or check out on YouTube.
[3104.64 → 3105.64] It'll be in the description below the video.
[3105.64 → 3106.92] It is just that easy.
[3107.26 → 3110.82] That'll be a lot easier to grab there.
[3111.50 → 3112.32] Oh my god.
[3112.50 → 3114.80] Let me see if I can just get into the Twitch chat here.
[3115.50 → 3117.04] There are all sorts of stuff in here.
[3117.20 → 3117.94] Tons of things.
[3118.00 → 3119.64] It's even smaller than the box it's in.
[3119.74 → 3120.48] It's like a computer.
[3120.48 → 3122.14] I would hope.
[3122.66 → 3123.40] That would be good.
[3124.04 → 3125.34] Okay, this is going to work.
[3125.46 → 3126.50] All right, link coming.
[3126.86 → 3127.46] Hold on.
[3129.82 → 3130.78] That's really yellow.
[3131.18 → 3131.46] Boom.
[3132.24 → 3132.64] Boom.
[3132.98 → 3133.34] Boom.
[3133.90 → 3134.34] Boom.
[3134.68 → 3135.34] There you go.
[3136.16 → 3136.60] Boo yah!
[3136.68 → 3137.20] Twitch chat.
[3137.54 → 3138.60] You have the link now.
[3138.84 → 3140.00] I can't close this anymore.
[3140.92 → 3141.74] It's in the chat.
[3141.82 → 3142.84] We're just going to put this down.
[3143.18 → 3143.78] You guys are good.
[3145.52 → 3146.12] Moving on.
[3146.20 → 3146.96] Yes, here, I'll take it.
[3147.10 → 3147.36] Thank you.
[3147.88 → 3148.44] Thank you.
[3148.44 → 3151.42] You did a great job with your van awaiting.
[3151.72 → 3152.54] I appreciate it.
[3153.50 → 3154.20] Moving on.
[3154.20 → 3154.62] I wish I was a verb.
[3155.78 → 3156.40] You were a verb?
[3156.62 → 3156.90] Yeah.
[3157.06 → 3157.86] She's a verb now.
[3159.06 → 3161.56] Man, I just want to laser jams right now.
[3161.98 → 3163.78] Yeah, I saw I was laser naming last night.
[3165.48 → 3169.46] Anyway, back to basically sponsor spots.
[3169.60 → 3171.24] Flow plane, a bunch of cool stuff.
[3171.24 → 3175.72] We have a tech wiki on how stealth technology works, which is sick.
[3175.82 → 3177.22] I'm going to watch that one.
[3177.28 → 3178.32] That's actually pretty cool.
[3179.44 → 3182.24] We have a video on the OnePlus 5T.
[3182.34 → 3185.12] We have a hands-on for that, which is pretty neat.
[3185.22 → 3186.62] We have a video that I hosted.
[3186.84 → 3187.50] Whoa, what?
[3187.60 → 3188.16] That's weird.
[3188.52 → 3192.66] It's the Xbox One X versus PS4 Pro versus $500 PC.
[3193.08 → 3194.30] Results may surprise you.
[3194.36 → 3195.60] Oh, I've got to watch that one, too.
[3195.88 → 3196.50] It's interesting.
[3198.18 → 3200.42] Everyone's response to it is exactly what I expected.
[3200.76 → 3201.14] Nice.
[3201.42 → 3201.68] Yeah.
[3201.86 → 3203.00] Everyone who's on Float plane.
[3203.00 → 3203.98] Everyone who's on Float plane.
[3204.06 → 3205.44] Not like YouTube peasants.
[3205.82 → 3208.20] It will be coming to YouTube later, but it's on Float plane now.
[3208.28 → 3209.00] Yeah, and it's Friday.
[3209.12 → 3210.22] So what are you going to do all weekend?
[3210.90 → 3212.02] You don't have stuff to do.
[3212.58 → 3214.74] Unless you're a Float planer.
[3215.04 → 3216.60] Or coming to my charity stream.
[3216.78 → 3217.14] Oh, yeah.
[3217.20 → 3217.42] True.
[3217.82 → 3218.66] And are a Float planer.
[3218.66 → 3219.82] I've got so much stuff to do.
[3219.82 → 3220.76] What a double combo.
[3221.18 → 3223.84] Tech Wiki on Power line Ethernet, which is actually fascinating.
[3223.98 → 3224.96] Power line Ethernet is weird.
[3225.06 → 3226.50] It's Internet that goes through your power lines.
[3226.80 → 3227.66] Sort of makes sense.
[3227.88 → 3227.96] What?
[3227.96 → 3230.16] I don't even know what that is, let alone how it works.
[3230.46 → 3231.28] It's pretty neat, though.
[3231.80 → 3233.22] The opportunities for education are immense.
[3233.50 → 3234.06] It's amazing.
[3234.50 → 3235.64] Tons of really cool videos.
[3236.06 → 3237.38] Razor blade 4K review.
[3237.54 → 3238.90] I don't think that's on YouTube yet.
[3239.04 → 3242.08] And that has probably one of the best skits in a video we've ever done.
[3242.64 → 3246.64] Oh, is that the one with me when I'm in this coat?
[3247.88 → 3248.86] No, that was a phone.
[3249.84 → 3250.54] I don't think it's that.
[3250.56 → 3250.88] All right.
[3251.42 → 3251.90] Are you in this?
[3251.90 → 3252.84] We've got lots of good skits.
[3253.12 → 3253.94] I'm not in it.
[3254.52 → 3254.76] Oh.
[3255.48 → 3255.76] Yeah.
[3256.00 → 3256.94] Can't be the best skit.
[3257.12 → 3257.40] No.
[3258.10 → 3259.36] The best skit would have us both.
[3259.54 → 3259.84] Yeah.
[3260.62 → 3260.94] Yeah.
[3261.28 → 3261.48] Yeah.
[3262.96 → 3263.32] Yeah.
[3263.70 → 3264.74] Self-bat packing.
[3264.76 → 3265.48] Yeah, we're guards.
[3265.76 → 3266.52] Bat-packing?
[3266.86 → 3270.24] I love how every once in a while the words just come out in super weird ways.
[3270.24 → 3270.42] Everyone gets it.
[3270.62 → 3271.22] Everyone knows.
[3271.54 → 3271.92] All right.
[3272.08 → 3272.68] Firefox.
[3273.00 → 3273.80] That topic.
[3274.10 → 3275.18] Might as well move on to it.
[3275.36 → 3275.52] Yeah.
[3275.58 → 3279.82] You should open up the source number two because we can check it out on the screen.
[3280.02 → 3281.06] And there's lots to see.
[3281.20 → 3282.10] I need to find it.
[3283.22 → 3283.96] There we go.
[3284.02 → 3284.30] Got it.
[3284.36 → 3289.50] The Firefox Hardware Survey, which uses telemetry supplied by the browser to assess what hardware
[3289.50 → 3295.50] participants are using, has revealed some surprising statistics related to GPU market share.
[3296.02 → 3296.24] Yeah.
[3296.24 → 3299.90] So we can not see right here because this is in the way, but I'm just going to move us.
[3299.90 → 3303.06] Turns out more people, maybe.
[3303.06 → 3304.26] For graphics.
[3304.50 → 3307.16] We've got AMD at 15%.
[3307.16 → 3310.06] We've got Intel at 65%.
[3310.06 → 3312.90] So that's the built-in graphics on your CPU that they're talking about.
[3313.00 → 3313.74] Integrated graphics.
[3313.74 → 3314.72] NVIDIA.
[3314.72 → 3314.74] Yeah.
[3314.74 → 3314.76] NVIDIA.
[3314.76 → 3315.78] 14%.
[3315.78 → 3317.52] That's 1% behind AMD.
[3317.52 → 3318.36] What the heck?
[3318.36 → 3318.92] What?
[3318.92 → 3320.76] What a surprise.
[3320.76 → 3323.30] I mean, this isn't just people in the world.
[3323.92 → 3325.30] This is Firefox users.
[3325.72 → 3325.96] Yeah.
[3326.00 → 3327.10] Who filled out the survey?
[3327.50 → 3330.24] Or wait, did anyone actively fill this out?
[3330.32 → 3330.76] Is it just...
[3330.76 → 3331.72] Firefox Hardware Report.
[3331.82 → 3332.36] I think you have to...
[3332.36 → 3334.74] You have to like opt in to supply data or whatever, right?
[3335.66 → 3340.44] So it's possible there's a selection bias where AMD people are just the type of people who opt
[3340.44 → 3341.12] into this stuff.
[3341.80 → 3343.08] Doesn't seem likely to me, but it's possible.
[3343.08 → 3345.44] I don't think that's necessarily what's going on.
[3345.44 → 3348.86] I have a main theory for this.
[3349.70 → 3355.08] Firefox right now is the like, this is the ethical choice of browsers.
[3355.54 → 3357.54] This is the underdog browser.
[3358.04 → 3360.84] This is the browser that not the mainstream uses.
[3361.18 → 3362.90] Oh, and those are the same people as 2Red.
[3362.90 → 3365.48] You can rebel and use this browser.
[3365.66 → 3366.06] I see.
[3366.60 → 3372.52] It's similar arguments to don't use the big mainstream scary guy thing that a lot of the
[3372.52 → 3373.52] AMD guys are making.
[3373.52 → 3376.80] And I think it might make sense that there are more of them on this platform.
[3377.26 → 3381.18] Regardless, even if that is true, this is still super cool.
[3381.74 → 3382.18] Definitely.
[3382.62 → 3383.20] This is good.
[3383.38 → 3388.92] People, for some reason, are comparing this to uses or stats that we had from Steam's hardware
[3388.92 → 3389.38] survey.
[3389.88 → 3393.58] TPCS is coming in with the sassy, Luke, where have you been?
[3395.20 → 3397.94] This has been the case with Firefox for years.
[3398.64 → 3403.46] So yeah, apparently that might actually be more true of a statement than I've been...
[3403.46 → 3404.48] So he's backing up your theory.
[3404.70 → 3405.74] Yeah, I guess.
[3406.14 → 3406.62] Indirectly.
[3406.62 → 3407.64] He doesn't know.
[3408.20 → 3408.56] Yeah.
[3408.84 → 3410.18] We don't even know that he's a he.
[3410.18 → 3410.70] No one actually knows.
[3411.10 → 3412.08] Yes, that's true.
[3412.32 → 3412.54] Yeah.
[3412.76 → 3414.58] I don't think anyone actually really knows.
[3414.76 → 3417.74] But I wouldn't be surprised if that is at least part of it.
[3418.14 → 3422.36] For some reason, people are saying that this is super at odds with the Steam hardware
[3422.36 → 3424.98] survey, the latest iteration of which came out in October.
[3424.98 → 3425.42] Yeah.
[3425.64 → 3431.68] Where the GPU market share for NVIDIA was over 80% and AMD was only 10% and Intel integrated
[3431.68 → 3433.38] graphics was only like 7.5%.
[3433.38 → 3436.08] It's pretty obvious why these numbers are so vastly different.
[3436.32 → 3436.46] Yeah.
[3436.56 → 3440.38] Selection bias being you're someone who has Steam installed.
[3440.52 → 3441.46] So you're a gamer.
[3441.68 → 3442.98] So you're less likely to have integrated graphics.
[3444.02 → 3449.34] And if you're going to have a gaming type of GPU, it's likely going to be NVIDIA.
[3449.50 → 3450.16] Surprise, surprise.
[3450.16 → 3452.16] Most people on the internet don't have a gaming PC.
[3454.20 → 3460.26] They're probably using laptops even that just don't have any form of dedicated graphics.
[3460.48 → 3462.88] And it's all integrated on chips, and you can't even add one.
[3462.92 → 3468.14] Or they're using older like Best Buy PCs that were just like home PCs that don't have graphics
[3468.14 → 3468.46] cards.
[3468.54 → 3473.36] Even though it's like obviously a weird comparison to make, I can see why it's being made.
[3473.42 → 3478.54] Because those Steam hardware stats get cited a lot, particularly in displays.
[3478.54 → 3483.70] Like the fact that only 4% of Steam players have 4K monitors.
[3483.90 → 3488.28] Like that stat gets thrown around all the time when people are talking about how prevalent
[3488.28 → 3489.34] 4K monitors really are.
[3490.18 → 3490.96] So, okay.
[3492.80 → 3496.24] Steam stats are popular, but they just really don't have any relevance here.
[3496.74 → 3496.96] Yeah.
[3497.02 → 3499.14] It doesn't matter for this specific use case.
[3499.32 → 3501.98] And there are a lot of cheaper laptops.
[3502.10 → 3505.56] I don't know if necessarily right now, but at least when I worked in retail that sold with
[3505.56 → 3506.54] AMD graphics.
[3506.54 → 3509.28] So, it was...
[3509.28 → 3513.86] I actually probably sold more laptops at that point in time that had AMD graphics because
[3513.86 → 3515.22] it was more affordable.
[3516.10 → 3518.70] So, more people were buying them from my store.
[3519.82 → 3522.00] I didn't own the store, but the store that I worked at.
[3522.40 → 3523.84] Can we see that page again?
[3524.20 → 3524.52] Yeah.
[3524.52 → 3526.00] Because it had more than just GPUs on there.
[3526.44 → 3526.78] Yeah.
[3526.78 → 3528.18] That was an interesting part, too.
[3528.30 → 3530.56] So, it has quite a few different things.
[3530.80 → 3533.32] It even has operating system, which I find fascinating.
[3533.48 → 3536.10] Windows 7 was at 46%, which is...
[3536.10 → 3536.56] Wow.
[3536.82 → 3537.12] What?
[3537.12 → 3537.90] Actually pretty crazy.
[3538.02 → 3539.04] Windows 10 is only 54%.
[3539.04 → 3540.62] That gives credence to your theory, then.
[3540.84 → 3541.70] This is a certain...
[3541.70 → 3543.28] Like, a certain type of person uses Firefox.
[3543.28 → 3547.04] These are people that intensely resisted upgrading to Windows 10.
[3547.16 → 3547.98] That's crazy.
[3548.34 → 3549.48] I love Windows 7.
[3550.12 → 3550.40] Wow.
[3550.48 → 3554.20] I stayed on Windows 7 for a long time, but the only reason why I moved off of it was
[3554.20 → 3557.80] because of the constant super aggressive annoying pressure from Windows 10.
[3558.06 → 3560.72] So, I moved to a Windows 8.1 embedded copy.
[3560.80 → 3561.52] So, you goof, man.
[3561.52 → 3562.02] I wouldn't bug me.
[3562.04 → 3563.44] I'm still on 98 and sick.
[3563.74 → 3564.16] Nice.
[3564.24 → 3564.40] Yeah.
[3564.56 → 3565.44] So, I'll tear all day.
[3565.54 → 3566.24] That's pretty legit.
[3566.56 → 3567.42] That's pretty cool.
[3567.46 → 3567.96] All day.
[3568.32 → 3571.84] After that, we've got 1% of users on Windows XP.
[3572.14 → 3572.58] Guys!
[3573.20 → 3573.94] Come on!
[3575.00 → 3575.44] Update!
[3576.08 → 3576.44] Man!
[3576.50 → 3576.72] Never!
[3577.28 → 3578.26] What are you doing?
[3579.46 → 3579.86] Oh.
[3580.14 → 3580.94] Those are just work computers.
[3580.94 → 3583.50] 8% of people on Windows 8.1 represent!
[3584.22 → 3584.94] That's me!
[3584.94 → 3587.00] You think there's a sliver for Vista in there?
[3588.18 → 3589.58] macOS 5%.
[3589.58 → 3590.88] Other 6%.
[3590.88 → 3592.30] There's your Vista.
[3592.76 → 3593.10] Yeah.
[3593.28 → 3594.64] There are a few people on Vista.
[3595.26 → 3599.94] Speaking of Firefox users, these people are going to be pretty pumped because Firefox
[3599.94 → 3601.46] Quantum is out now.
[3601.62 → 3602.28] Have you used this yet?
[3602.30 → 3603.28] I have used it.
[3603.36 → 3604.40] I'm actually loving it.
[3604.50 → 3604.82] Really?
[3605.02 → 3605.30] Yeah.
[3605.32 → 3605.58] I even tweeted about this.
[3605.58 → 3607.04] I was thinking about taking it for a spin.
[3607.26 → 3607.88] It's good.
[3608.08 → 3608.44] Should I?
[3608.56 → 3608.98] Yeah.
[3608.98 → 3613.76] So, I've seen people having issues.
[3614.40 → 3616.66] I have not personally had any issues.
[3616.76 → 3616.98] Okay.
[3616.98 → 3621.34] I know there are some things where people like certain specific add-ons that aren't quite
[3621.34 → 3622.34] on Quantum yet.
[3622.82 → 3627.28] Some people don't like how certain parts of the browser aren't customizable.
[3627.28 → 3629.46] But, um...
[3629.46 → 3631.52] Let's talk about the core value proposition of this browser.
[3632.24 → 3637.78] According to Mozilla, Firefox Quantum is over twice as fast as the Firefox from just six
[3637.78 → 3638.28] months ago.
[3638.62 → 3644.76] Built on a completely overhauled core engine and boasting a stylish new design, dubbed Photon
[3644.76 → 3648.44] UI, which streamlines a number of elements included in previous releases.
[3648.44 → 3650.38] So, I'm not going to lie.
[3651.04 → 3653.52] This marketing ticked a lot of people off.
[3653.90 → 3657.56] And for reasons that I understand.
[3658.04 → 3659.28] Do they show it here?
[3660.74 → 3661.30] Somewhere.
[3661.72 → 3664.04] They showed, like, two times faster.
[3664.44 → 3670.12] And then they show a comparison of Firefox Quantum versus the most recent version of Chrome.
[3670.60 → 3675.16] So, people don't realize that they were talking about a previous version of Firefox.
[3676.48 → 3677.04] Okay.
[3677.04 → 3683.38] Because they show two times faster in big, bold text, and then directly beside it, a comparison
[3683.38 → 3684.78] of Quantum versus Chrome.
[3684.84 → 3685.02] Right.
[3685.06 → 3688.24] When they're meaning two times faster than their own product.
[3689.18 → 3694.54] They do say Quantum is faster to load a number of popular websites than Chrome is.
[3694.68 → 3694.92] Yeah.
[3696.02 → 3699.82] Including Wikipedia, Bing, no one cares, Tumblr, and Shutterstock.
[3700.74 → 3701.58] No one cares.
[3702.04 → 3702.30] I like that.
[3702.30 → 3707.80] Firefox uses around 30% less memory than Chrome, Edge, and Safari on Windows.
[3707.80 → 3711.32] So, there are some things going on here.
[3711.42 → 3715.80] One thing that I did appreciate is that in their own testing, in their own video, showing
[3715.80 → 3718.90] load time comparisons between Quantum and Chrome.
[3718.90 → 3723.84] It shows Quantum winning quite often.
[3724.06 → 3725.46] Not by two times.
[3725.46 → 3729.98] And someone in the chat says, in fairness, in the comparison video, it shows fairly equivalent
[3729.98 → 3730.38] speeds.
[3730.78 → 3733.86] If I remember correctly, Quantum wins usually.
[3734.24 → 3736.56] And I'm sure they cherry-picked sites to a certain degree.
[3737.28 → 3742.12] But I know at least one point in time, the Chrome browser did beat the Quantum browser.
[3742.12 → 3742.64] In their own video.
[3742.78 → 3744.08] And they included it in their own video.
[3744.18 → 3744.44] That's cool.
[3744.46 → 3745.42] I thought that was pretty cool.
[3745.42 → 3750.26] So, it was a weird, like, we're going to show ourselves losing, and at the same time,
[3750.32 → 3751.94] we're going to do super misleading marketing.
[3753.06 → 3754.76] So, it was like, what?
[3756.54 → 3761.08] So, like, if anyone actually watched the video at all, they would have known something was
[3761.08 → 3761.32] up.
[3761.54 → 3763.78] But, yeah, it's been a delight to use it so far.
[3763.88 → 3765.08] I think it looks great.
[3765.68 → 3767.52] It's run great for me.
[3768.22 → 3770.62] Float plane runs on it beautifully.
[3771.14 → 3772.28] Just want to put that out there.
[3772.28 → 3777.52] Linus Tech Tips writer Anthony Young chimed in virtually, saying, Firefox users may also
[3777.52 → 3780.12] be more likely to be running Apus.
[3782.08 → 3782.48] Yeah.
[3782.62 → 3785.50] So, if we want to jump back slightly to that topic.
[3786.20 → 3788.64] This was six minutes ago that he sent me that.
[3789.74 → 3790.12] Bop, bop, bop.
[3790.26 → 3793.58] We can look at the processor section, which is shown to you guys good.
[3793.96 → 3795.76] Intel is at 88%.
[3795.76 → 3798.08] AMD is at 12%.
[3798.08 → 3801.78] I don't know what the Steam Hardware Survey for that is, but I wouldn't be surprised if
[3801.78 → 3804.24] on the Steam Hardware Survey, Intel was even higher.
[3805.10 → 3805.52] You think?
[3806.84 → 3807.20] Yeah.
[3807.40 → 3810.52] There were so many years when AMD wasn't putting out a new CPU, right?
[3810.60 → 3810.96] Yeah, yeah.
[3810.96 → 3812.90] So, I don't know, but I wouldn't be surprised.
[3813.26 → 3816.34] But it's not like AMD is crushing the processor side of things.
[3816.54 → 3817.66] Back to the quantum thing.
[3817.84 → 3820.82] I was like, ah, I should actually just check this out.
[3820.82 → 3825.96] Because I used to use Firefox forever until Chrome came out in 2008.
[3826.08 → 3827.92] I just wanted to check it out, and I liked the design.
[3828.28 → 3829.32] I haven't used Firefox since.
[3829.36 → 3831.18] I was like, I should go back to my roots here.
[3831.66 → 3835.30] But then I had the thought, well, it'll be like two weeks until Chrome is better again.
[3835.38 → 3837.36] They'll just make a new version.
[3837.46 → 3837.84] It'll be better.
[3837.84 → 3841.44] I like using Firefox, and it is very fast.
[3841.62 → 3845.78] It's fast to the point where when using the previous, they said six months ago, it's two
[3845.78 → 3846.76] times faster than six months ago.
[3846.86 → 3848.00] It was notably slower.
[3849.86 → 3852.50] And now it's not notably slower.
[3852.66 → 3855.12] It's fast enough that I click on a site, and it just loads.
[3855.50 → 3856.64] But here's something that made me reconsider.
[3856.78 → 3861.90] I saw a quote from, I'm not sure if it was a CEO, but someone at Mozilla who was like,
[3862.66 → 3865.28] my biggest fear is that people just won't try it.
[3865.28 → 3867.48] I just want people to try it.
[3867.74 → 3870.14] And I read that, and I kind of tugged my heartstrings a bit.
[3870.22 → 3871.52] I was like, you know what, man?
[3872.06 → 3872.62] For you?
[3872.92 → 3873.78] I'll try it.
[3874.28 → 3874.90] I didn't yet.
[3875.86 → 3877.86] But I think I want to.
[3877.96 → 3878.58] I'm going to check it out.
[3878.58 → 3878.84] Wow.
[3878.96 → 3883.44] I don't know if people remember, but in a lot of my older videos, I used to wear, I have
[3883.44 → 3885.54] a couple, two different shirts.
[3885.72 → 3891.22] One of them just has the Firefox logo on it, and another one says, I am protecting the world's
[3891.22 → 3892.40] the largest resource.
[3892.40 → 3895.36] And on the back, it talks about Firefox.
[3896.16 → 3898.38] I kind of support them a little bit.
[3898.52 → 3898.68] Nice.
[3898.82 → 3903.58] I even have a little Firefox plushy thing, because I used to be like, when I actually programmed
[3903.58 → 3906.76] things, I used to be a big fan of Firefox.
[3907.16 → 3912.92] And I stopped using it because it was directly interfering with my day-to-day work.
[3912.92 → 3918.90] Because Firefox was crashing so often, or was slow, and all these other issues.
[3919.56 → 3925.42] And I excitedly, but with a lot of fear, installed Quantum.
[3925.82 → 3928.12] Because I was like, I really don't want this to fail me again.
[3928.50 → 3930.26] They are making a lot of strong claims.
[3930.60 → 3931.78] I'm going to give it a shot.
[3931.92 → 3933.06] And I gave it a strong shot.
[3933.18 → 3935.18] I installed all my different add-ons.
[3935.30 → 3937.84] I customized it, made it look exactly the way I wanted it to.
[3937.84 → 3939.68] And then dove deeply in.
[3939.76 → 3940.52] I have it on my work computer.
[3940.62 → 3941.60] I have it on my home computer.
[3941.64 → 3943.10] And now you're fully entangled.
[3943.22 → 3943.78] It's on my phone.
[3944.50 → 3944.88] It's great.
[3945.10 → 3945.48] You get it?
[3945.58 → 3946.06] It's been awesome.
[3946.22 → 3946.96] Anybody get that joke?
[3947.06 → 3947.72] It was a Quantum joke.
[3948.10 → 3948.46] Oh!
[3949.40 → 3949.72] Yes!
[3949.78 → 3950.56] That is good.
[3950.66 → 3951.16] That is good.
[3951.70 → 3957.34] Speaking of, I really hope that in the near future, these companies stop using Q or Quantum
[3957.34 → 3958.38] in their branding.
[3958.48 → 3962.42] Because there's going to come a point where there are actual products with actual Quantum capabilities.
[3962.42 → 3964.36] And we need to be able to differentiate that.
[3964.66 → 3964.92] Yes.
[3965.60 → 3966.34] That is actually.
[3966.80 → 3967.48] You know what I mean?
[3967.56 → 3967.96] Stop it.
[3967.96 → 3969.54] I immediately thought about that when I saw the name.
[3969.62 → 3970.74] I was like, is it actually?
[3970.74 → 3971.28] Oh, did they?
[3971.40 → 3972.56] Yeah, we're getting on the cusp, right?
[3972.64 → 3973.08] Like, nah.
[3973.32 → 3973.82] In what way?
[3973.94 → 3974.62] Well, I was actually.
[3974.74 → 3979.84] I thought it might be like some super wacko experimental thing that they were working on.
[3980.16 → 3981.64] And then I was like, oh, it's just their new browser.
[3981.80 → 3981.96] What?
[3982.36 → 3983.78] That actually was a little bit confusing.
[3983.98 → 3984.28] So, yeah.
[3984.34 → 3985.38] I hear you on that one.
[3985.38 → 3987.52] But, yeah.
[3987.66 → 3988.04] I don't know.
[3988.12 → 3993.48] I think it's cool having a browser that actually isn't made by a company that aggressively
[3993.48 → 3997.06] profits off of harvesting every single thing that you do in your entire life.
[3998.12 → 3998.68] That's weird.
[3999.64 → 4000.14] You know?
[4000.64 → 4001.88] Like, I don't know.
[4002.10 → 4003.84] Kind of down with the Firefox a little bit.
[4004.24 → 4005.62] So, we've been doing this for long enough.
[4005.68 → 4006.82] But do you want to do a couple more?
[4007.66 → 4008.52] I mean, I'm down.
[4008.62 → 4009.74] We have been doing this long enough.
[4009.78 → 4010.34] What do you want to do?
[4010.98 → 4012.34] Oh, there are so many exciting ones.
[4012.52 → 4012.68] Okay.
[4013.16 → 4014.38] There's some rapid fire ones.
[4014.78 → 4015.00] Okay.
[4015.00 → 4015.92] Apple HomePod.
[4016.14 → 4017.22] The big speaker.
[4017.44 → 4020.54] It's kind of a smart speaker from Apple.
[4021.56 → 4021.96] Delayed.
[4022.46 → 4023.98] Missing out on the holiday season.
[4024.30 → 4026.42] This brings joy to my heart, actually.
[4027.48 → 4031.06] I'm actually kind of an anti-fanboy with Apple.
[4031.16 → 4032.00] I do respect Apple.
[4032.04 → 4035.34] And I think a lot of their products are pretty objectively sick.
[4035.58 → 4036.56] Like, they're sweet.
[4036.72 → 4039.22] But, on the other hand, sometimes I like a little win.
[4039.56 → 4040.80] I like when...
[4040.80 → 4042.70] Because it's not that I don't like Apple.
[4043.70 → 4044.90] It's like a satisfying...
[4044.90 → 4046.42] Satisfying stab.
[4046.98 → 4047.20] Yeah.
[4047.20 → 4049.30] I don't like Apple fanboys.
[4049.42 → 4050.98] So, I'm like a counterforce to that.
[4052.64 → 4053.40] Oh, stop.
[4053.54 → 4054.32] Get out of here.
[4054.68 → 4056.26] You're talking about the ad, not me, right?
[4056.26 → 4056.58] Yes.
[4056.58 → 4057.12] Okay, great.
[4057.64 → 4060.20] So, full disclosure.
[4061.18 → 4062.60] HomePod is not...
[4062.60 → 4065.60] Is a small part of Apple's revenue.
[4065.74 → 4067.00] It's in the other services.
[4067.44 → 4068.36] Or in the other section.
[4068.36 → 4069.52] Why do you hate Apple so much?
[4069.60 → 4070.30] I don't hate Apple.
[4070.42 → 4071.28] I hate Apple fanboys.
[4072.30 → 4073.06] Apple's pretty dope.
[4073.16 → 4075.16] Do you hate Android fanboys?
[4075.78 → 4076.94] I hate all fanboys.
[4077.26 → 4077.60] Okay.
[4078.34 → 4079.70] I like objective people.
[4079.98 → 4080.34] Okay.
[4080.68 → 4081.10] But...
[4081.10 → 4085.14] So, you want Apple to hurt because you dislike the people that like Apple.
[4085.40 → 4086.44] No, I don't want Apple to hurt.
[4086.54 → 4088.36] I want Apple fanboys to hurt.
[4088.36 → 4092.24] Oh, so you're hoping this doesn't really hurt their bottom line.
[4092.56 → 4092.94] It won't.
[4092.98 → 4093.96] But you're also like...
[4093.96 → 4096.36] You don't get your thing for Christmas.
[4096.86 → 4097.06] Yeah.
[4097.06 → 4099.58] It won't hurt their bottom line because this is one of their other products.
[4100.28 → 4103.34] And they get the majority of their revenue from the iPhones and their services.
[4103.92 → 4105.26] So, that's going to be minuscule anyway.
[4105.46 → 4112.34] But it actually could hurt them in the future because right now, these smart speakers and home
[4112.34 → 4115.78] implementations are really starting to gain traction.
[4115.90 → 4117.76] Especially since Google Home Mini is out now.
[4117.76 → 4120.24] There's a bazillion different types of Amazon Echoes.
[4121.24 → 4125.10] I think they're going to be a pretty significant gift this holiday season.
[4125.48 → 4128.36] And for Apple to miss that, it's going to be...
[4128.36 → 4129.02] That hurts.
[4129.30 → 4130.54] And it's hitting mainstream.
[4131.16 → 4131.66] That's what I'm saying.
[4131.80 → 4134.48] And my grandfather and my mom have one.
[4135.00 → 4139.00] And that's not like me forcing it on them.
[4139.04 → 4141.40] Be like, use this to support your son or grandson.
[4141.40 → 4141.82] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4141.94 → 4142.74] This is like...
[4142.74 → 4144.06] I got one from my grandpa.
[4144.32 → 4146.04] I believe he got one from my mom.
[4146.04 → 4148.88] And they both actively use it all the time.
[4149.22 → 4151.54] Well, everyone has everything these days.
[4151.70 → 4152.94] What are you going to get someone for Christmas?
[4153.12 → 4154.32] So, this is totally a thing.
[4154.46 → 4154.68] Yeah.
[4154.94 → 4156.10] Except the HomePod won't be.
[4156.62 → 4164.50] And notably, Google's answer to the HomePod, which is the Google Home Max, looks very similar.
[4164.60 → 4169.38] Has similar sound speaker focusing capabilities.
[4169.38 → 4171.38] It will be on sale this holiday season.
[4171.92 → 4172.20] Oh.
[4172.90 → 4173.34] Oh.
[4174.12 → 4174.40] Oh.
[4174.84 → 4175.04] Oh.
[4175.04 → 4175.38] Oh.
[4175.38 → 4180.04] And this is just so bad for Apple because even though Siri is the oldest virtual assistant,
[4180.22 → 4182.78] it is quite clearly the worst.
[4183.02 → 4185.56] And they just need any opportunity they can get.
[4185.56 → 4185.58] Really?
[4185.58 → 4186.54] It's worse than Cortana?
[4187.42 → 4187.90] Hmm.
[4188.10 → 4189.90] Or are you only classifying the two?
[4190.16 → 4190.96] Cortana's that bad.
[4190.96 → 4193.20] No, I was thinking of Bixby as well.
[4193.34 → 4193.48] Ah.
[4194.14 → 4195.20] Bixby's actually pretty dope.
[4195.70 → 4196.00] Really?
[4196.44 → 4200.68] It's probably, as a general assistant, it's probably on the level of Siri, but it has
[4200.68 → 4206.88] these extra capabilities that we used in our showcase video that let you navigate through
[4206.88 → 4207.22] apps.
[4207.36 → 4209.68] Like, open this app and go to settings and then change this setting.
[4209.96 → 4211.22] Go to my home screen, swipe right.
[4211.28 → 4212.72] You can't even do that with the assistant yet.
[4213.06 → 4216.24] And I can't wait until you can because it's super sweet to be able to do that.
[4217.70 → 4218.60] Cortana, I don't know.
[4218.68 → 4222.90] I've actually seen videos on YouTube of people using Cortana to do these, like, kick-ass things
[4222.90 → 4228.50] in Excel, which I'd love to program macros by voice, like, using Cortana.
[4228.94 → 4232.84] I just, like, can't be bothered because it seems like such an upfront cost.
[4233.48 → 4237.80] But anyway, Apple needs any opportunity they can get to try to catch up in this space, and
[4237.80 → 4239.60] they're just not getting it.
[4240.48 → 4242.08] And eventually, I think it's going to be the end.
[4242.24 → 4246.64] I don't think I've ever heard anyone say anything positive about Cortana, although that
[4246.64 → 4250.72] Excel thing does sound cool, but I haven't had it work in any form in any other way.
[4250.72 → 4251.42] So there's that.
[4252.40 → 4253.52] Or Bigsby.
[4253.68 → 4256.16] I haven't personally used Bigsby, but yes.
[4256.84 → 4258.78] That dedicated button is rough.
[4259.58 → 4261.34] Well, I mean, I didn't say it's perfect.
[4261.48 → 4263.86] I'm just saying, like, Siri is just pretty weak.
[4264.24 → 4264.58] Yes.
[4265.06 → 4265.34] Yeah.
[4265.84 → 4272.32] Watching Linus try to use Siri to call someone while we were driving for lunch was hilarious.
[4272.52 → 4272.92] Oh, no.
[4273.32 → 4276.32] It just couldn't do it.
[4276.80 → 4278.80] Like, it was actually hilariously bad.
[4278.80 → 4280.54] Well, the Google Assistant's not perfect either.
[4280.54 → 4281.18] I'm actually...
[4281.18 → 4281.24] No.
[4281.40 → 4282.10] I'm disappointed.
[4282.24 → 4286.02] You know what Bigsby can do that Assistant doesn't seem to be able to do is chain commands.
[4286.42 → 4288.64] Like, on Bigsby, I can say...
[4288.64 → 4289.48] Siri can't do that?
[4289.72 → 4290.76] Because Google Assistant can.
[4291.14 → 4291.90] Google Assistant...
[4291.90 → 4298.08] My Google Home, even though I can say the command and say, turn on my TV, and I can tell
[4298.08 → 4303.48] it to play a certain video on YouTube, I can't say, turn on the TV and play the latest
[4303.48 → 4304.56] Sauce video on YouTube.
[4305.12 → 4306.80] It'll say, I don't know how to do that.
[4306.80 → 4308.32] But if I say...
[4308.32 → 4311.58] There was one I did yesterday where I...
[4311.58 → 4312.28] Bigsby can't do that either.
[4313.50 → 4315.66] Well, but Bigsby can change commands.
[4315.80 → 4324.14] It can do things like, go to Instagram and post my third-latest photo with the caption,
[4324.36 → 4324.78] blah, blah, blah.
[4325.52 → 4325.88] Okay.
[4326.76 → 4328.40] Is that one long command, though?
[4328.40 → 4328.48] Yeah.
[4328.66 → 4328.84] Yeah.
[4328.94 → 4333.84] You can say, go to the settings and open and go to display settings and change the screen
[4333.84 → 4334.70] timeout to 10 minutes.
[4336.20 → 4336.52] Yeah.
[4336.86 → 4337.18] Okay.
[4337.30 → 4337.74] Which is cool.
[4339.20 → 4342.96] But there was a command I issued yesterday to my Google Assistant that I...
[4342.96 → 4346.52] It was two commands, and I put them this way, and it said, I don't know how to do that.
[4346.58 → 4349.96] And then I rephrased it, the same commands in a different order, and then it did it.
[4349.96 → 4354.00] Like, I wonder if that's part of it, because I use Google Assistant for everything, and
[4354.00 → 4358.80] I play specific songs with it within...
[4358.80 → 4362.40] Like, it has to open an app and then find the specific song and whatnot all the time,
[4362.44 → 4363.44] which is two different steps.
[4364.52 → 4366.24] Well, that's actually...
[4366.24 → 4367.58] Open Google Play Music and play whatever song.
[4367.58 → 4372.14] That's actually one, because you can't say, open Google Play Music.
[4372.26 → 4373.24] Yeah, I believe I can.
[4373.62 → 4376.76] I know that I can't say, hey, open YouTube.
[4377.74 → 4379.02] On Google Home.
[4379.46 → 4381.08] I can't say, open YouTube on the TV.
[4381.26 → 4383.80] I have to say, open YouTube and play Linus Tech Tips on the TV.
[4383.94 → 4386.06] Yeah, but then I don't personally...
[4386.06 → 4389.58] This is what we should probably move on, but I don't personally think that's a huge point,
[4389.66 → 4391.30] because Bigsby isn't in a home device.
[4391.44 → 4391.72] Is it?
[4392.36 → 4393.22] Not that I know of.
[4393.22 → 4394.52] Yeah, so I don't know.
[4395.40 → 4395.76] Anyway.
[4397.46 → 4398.82] Amazon Echo is coming to Canada.
[4399.20 → 4400.54] Linus will be so stoked.
[4400.86 → 4402.54] We can finally start reviewing them and stuff.
[4403.24 → 4403.52] Yes.
[4403.60 → 4404.34] Do you know that story?
[4404.86 → 4405.16] No.
[4405.38 → 4406.10] We got an Echo.
[4406.64 → 4407.60] Oh, you tried?
[4407.82 → 4408.46] I tried.
[4408.64 → 4410.02] Dude, I tried on the Fire TV.
[4410.20 → 4412.80] I brought it home on a weekend and stuff, and I was like, the interface...
[4412.80 → 4413.70] Like, this is worked.
[4413.86 → 4414.62] Yeah, basically.
[4414.62 → 4418.28] I did tech support calls and all this junk, and it's like, yeah, you're just not supposed
[4418.28 → 4418.94] to be using that.
[4419.02 → 4419.28] Yeah.
[4419.68 → 4420.26] Same thing happened to you?
[4420.26 → 4421.34] And you can, like...
[4421.34 → 4422.90] With mine, it was like, you can't use it at all.
[4422.96 → 4424.22] It wouldn't even allow itself to set up.
[4424.42 → 4427.64] So I, like, Vaned my router, so that when it connected to the Wi-Fi, it thought it was in
[4427.64 → 4427.98] America.
[4428.14 → 4428.86] And I was like, okay, cool.
[4429.44 → 4430.02] And then...
[4430.02 → 4430.16] Hi.
[4430.48 → 4430.68] Yeah.
[4430.68 → 4431.86] Oh, hi.
[4432.08 → 4432.36] Hi.
[4432.42 → 4433.02] Linus says hi.
[4433.32 → 4435.16] They're going to be all salty that you're not here now.
[4435.92 → 4436.50] They're salty?
[4436.90 → 4437.50] Well, they're going to be...
[4437.50 → 4440.82] Well, now they know that I'm on the WAN show even though you're in the building.
[4441.50 → 4442.58] What does it mean?
[4444.12 → 4445.34] Linus is quitting video.
[4446.48 → 4448.04] Someone in the chat said Linus is fired.
[4448.04 → 4452.94] He's just going to drive his multiple Tesla Roadsters from now on that he drives around in
[4452.94 → 4454.08] his Tesla semi-truck.
[4454.08 → 4455.34] Um...
[4455.34 → 4457.42] What were we talking about?
[4458.26 → 4459.18] We were talking about Amazon.
[4459.88 → 4460.46] Right, yeah.
[4460.56 → 4462.08] So we got one for a review.
[4462.32 → 4465.68] I had to VPN my router to even freaking make the thing work at all.
[4465.90 → 4469.14] And then it couldn't do almost anything because...
[4469.14 → 4469.74] I mean, Canada.
[4469.90 → 4471.74] And it doesn't know any of the stuff for up here.
[4471.84 → 4473.24] And I was just like, oh, okay.
[4473.24 → 4479.60] And then we sent it to a person, I'm not going to say who, who was in America to do a review
[4479.60 → 4484.34] on it and like to write the notes for the review for us.
[4484.48 → 4486.58] And then we never heard from them again.
[4486.90 → 4487.74] Now it's gone.
[4489.02 → 4489.86] Well, it's here now.
[4489.94 → 4494.02] And apparently it's going to speak Canadian English with a Canadian English accent.
[4496.70 → 4499.44] So Eastern then, I guess?
[4499.44 → 4499.96] No, I don't.
[4500.52 → 4501.68] It's going to say a boot?
[4501.68 → 4501.72] A boot?
[4502.16 → 4503.00] Like, I don't know.
[4503.34 → 4503.60] What?
[4503.60 → 4504.12] What's the difference?
[4504.50 → 4505.16] What's it going to say?
[4505.46 → 4506.22] Yeah, open that, eh?
[4506.42 → 4508.02] It's going to say sorry instead of, sorry.
[4508.26 → 4508.60] Sorry.
[4508.84 → 4509.20] All right.
[4509.26 → 4512.18] It's not going to say like, I don't know what the Americans say.
[4512.20 → 4512.48] That's weird.
[4513.16 → 4515.32] I guess someone in the chat said Zed.
[4515.42 → 4516.10] That makes sense.
[4516.46 → 4516.94] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4517.46 → 4522.14] It's mostly that we pronounce O's like O's, and they pronounce O's like A's a lot.
[4522.54 → 4523.34] Like I'm sorry.
[4524.12 → 4525.50] And what's another one I've been noticing?
[4525.68 → 4525.86] Sorry.
[4526.10 → 4526.30] Yeah.
[4526.44 → 4526.68] Yeah.
[4526.88 → 4528.90] But anyway, it won't speak French.
[4529.84 → 4530.20] Yet.
[4530.20 → 4531.70] I don't care.
[4532.56 → 4533.40] Neither do I.
[4533.40 → 4534.16] Because I don't speak French.
[4534.24 → 4535.14] People in the East will.
[4535.14 → 4536.94] Apparently 20% of our population does.
[4537.04 → 4537.34] Yeah.
[4537.72 → 4537.98] Yeah.
[4538.56 → 4538.84] Well.
[4540.32 → 4541.84] Like as their main language.
[4541.94 → 4542.56] It'll be coming.
[4542.70 → 4543.46] French will come.
[4543.60 → 4546.34] I bet you more than 25% of our population can speak French.
[4546.44 → 4550.38] I bet you 20% of our population speaks French as their main language.
[4550.90 → 4552.30] No, it's less than that, actually.
[4552.54 → 4552.76] Really?
[4552.76 → 4554.88] I didn't put it in the notes, but I read it earlier.
[4555.64 → 4558.32] But this isn't actually the first country.
[4558.42 → 4561.70] I thought we would be maybe the second country that Echo was in, but we're not.
[4562.00 → 4564.68] They went to India a month ago and Japan last week.
[4564.80 → 4566.70] And presumably it's not English and India and Japan.
[4567.38 → 4567.54] Yeah.
[4567.54 → 4568.98] So get on it, French.
[4569.78 → 4570.40] Come on.
[4570.54 → 4571.66] There's going to be some deals too.
[4571.78 → 4576.82] The Echo is going to be 99 Canadian pesos instead of a regular 130.
[4577.16 → 4580.04] The Echo Dot is going to be 50 bucks instead of 70.
[4580.22 → 4583.40] And the Echo Plus is going to be 170 instead of 200.
[4583.40 → 4583.72] Danube.
[4585.04 → 4585.88] Danube.
[4586.12 → 4587.18] That's what it's going to say.
[4587.90 → 4589.26] You issued a command.
[4589.70 → 4593.50] It's going to execute the command and say, Danube, Danube.
[4593.80 → 4598.92] If you tell it, like, I'm going to go hike Mount Everest, it'll be like, good luck, big shoots.
[4600.00 → 4601.14] I've never even heard that one.
[4601.52 → 4601.70] Really?
[4602.34 → 4602.66] Okay.
[4604.14 → 4604.54] Anyway.
[4605.86 → 4606.44] Sancho's over.
[4606.98 → 4607.28] Yeah.
[4607.50 → 4607.90] That's it.
[4609.74 → 4610.14] Bye.
[4610.42 → 4612.96] If you want to see a cool charity stream, tune in tomorrow.
[4613.40 → 4615.22] I'll probably start at noon.
[4616.30 → 4617.32] Are you going to be laser looking?
[4617.78 → 4618.04] No.
[4618.38 → 4618.86] Try it.
[4618.96 → 4621.30] I will try it, but I'm not going to do it for the whole charity stream.
[4621.30 → 4621.42] Try it.
[4622.02 → 4623.98] Man, it's crazy how much it changes everything.
[4624.38 → 4625.52] Everything's super blue.
[4625.66 → 4626.22] That's cool, hey?
[4626.52 → 4626.72] Yeah.
[4626.84 → 4627.70] Dundee, Dundee.
[4627.88 → 4628.62] Dundee.
[4628.80 → 4632.54] We should actually submit this round show to an editor so when you put these on at the very end,
[4632.54 → 4634.22] it does a crazy effect.
[4634.42 → 4635.20] It's super annoying.
[4635.20 → 4636.66] Just for the people that made it to the end.
[4637.06 → 4638.34] Now all these people are saying laser look.
[4638.54 → 4640.86] Anyway, come by, check out the charity stream if you want.
[4640.96 → 4641.62] It's going to be awesome.
[4641.62 → 4644.72] I don't know what the heck Jake is trying to say, but it's fine.
[4645.04 → 4645.98] I think he called me an a-hole.
[4646.02 → 4646.84] He's irrelevant.
[4647.82 → 4648.32] Oh, harsh.
[4648.54 → 4649.16] It's okay.
[4649.28 → 4651.38] Oh, that's the harshest thing an influencer can say to you.
[4651.62 → 4656.50] Well, I was dropping a reference back to the iDubbsRiceGum kind of deal.
[4656.60 → 4657.38] I don't know what that is.
[4658.08 → 4659.16] I'm going home!
[4659.16 → 4659.72] Wow.
[4660.06 → 4661.18] Anyway, bye!
[4661.48 → 4662.30] Thanks for watching!
[4662.46 → 4662.96] Bye-bye!
[4663.20 → 4665.90] Charity stream, twitch.tv slash Luke underscore LAIR.
[4666.10 → 4666.48] Show up.
[4666.84 → 4668.16] Don't get money to kids or just watch.
[4668.48 → 4669.02] Actually do it.
[4669.06 → 4669.88] It's going to be lots of cool games.
[4670.00 → 4670.78] Retro stuff.
[4671.32 → 4671.56] Yeah.
[4671.98 → 4672.22] Boom.
[4672.88 → 4673.74] It worked!
[4674.74 → 4676.70] What did you write on that napkin that you crumbled up?
[4679.70 → 4680.06] Ah.
[4680.06 → 4682.04] We're not announcing on this show.
[4682.04 → 4691.48] Laser Luke looks at you and makes you puke.
[4692.38 → 4695.92] Apparently I'm also supposed to say discord.GG slash LTT.
[4697.30 → 4697.78] Yeah.
[4698.02 → 4699.06] It hasn't ended yet.
[4699.16 → 4705.20] We were just doing the thank you to fixity and thank you to Mack Weldon and thank you to Total.
[4707.94 → 4708.80] So, yeah.
[4708.98 → 4710.16] I guess check out that Discord.
[4710.16 → 4712.58] We actually have an official Discord now.
[4712.80 → 4713.80] So, check it out.
[4714.16 → 4716.54] If you link your forum account, you get access right away.
[4717.10 → 4719.48] If you don't, I think you have to wait 24 hours or something.
[4719.66 → 4720.86] So, link your forum account.
[4721.28 → 4721.74] Heck yeah.
[4721.92 → 4722.42] Sounds good.
[4723.06 → 4723.50] See you later.
[4723.76 → 4724.94] Use the Username emote.
[4725.52 → 4726.12] Is that a thing?
[4726.22 → 4726.54] Yeah!
[4727.18 → 4727.54] Nice!
