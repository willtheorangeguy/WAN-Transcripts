[0.00 --> 8.88]  All right, it's WAN show time again and you guys may or may not have noticed there's something a little different
[9.96 --> 13.16]  About the show today. I know what it is
[14.44 --> 21.92]  I'm screen sharing off a Mac. I'm using a Mac. Oh, no, that's it. Isn't it concept once I know right?
[23.28 --> 28.60]  So yeah, we've got a couple special guests. We've got Jay's two cents from the YouTube channel Jay's two cents
[28.60 --> 32.56]  There's pretty much no way you guys don't know who he is
[32.56 --> 38.40]  And then we've got Dimitri from hardware Canucks who a lot of you will probably know who he is as well
[38.40 --> 40.40]  So we've got a lot of great topics for you guys today
[40.88 --> 44.88]  What are they oh? Yeah in unexpected news?
[46.24 --> 53.28]  AMD's Vega graphics cards are more expensive than MSRP. Oh my god. Who saw that coming more vega news?
[53.28 --> 57.60]  Oh wait, I've got okay. You guys are all being sarcastic, which is kind of a dick move, okay?
[57.60 --> 60.20]  This is not a sarcastic show. No, okay? This is a
[60.72 --> 66.06]  This is a forthright and clear communicative show that sentences
[67.80 --> 74.68]  In other news Intel claims that the 8700k will be about 11% faster than the 7700k
[76.74 --> 80.30]  Cool, but can we just not say anything if we're gonna be not sarcastic?
[80.30 --> 84.08]  You know what if you guys aren't gonna like you guys aren't gonna do the show nicely then
[84.08 --> 87.24]  You could just go actually you know what no I'm just gonna go
[87.24 --> 93.08]  Okay, okay? Well after that we have probably more intro shows over
[93.08 --> 97.54]  This is the end this is the end of everything the end of days
[97.54 --> 99.54]  Hello world as we know it
[99.54 --> 100.54]  Hello world as we know it
[100.54 --> 101.54]  Hello world as we know it
[101.54 --> 104.54]  You are the weakest like
[104.54 --> 105.54]  Goodbye
[105.54 --> 106.54]  Goodbye
[106.54 --> 108.54]  Where'd you find that?
[108.54 --> 109.54]  It's very bottomless today
[109.54 --> 110.54]  What?
[110.54 --> 111.54]  What?
[111.54 --> 112.54]  I was looking for it
[112.54 --> 113.54]  Neither of us could find it
[113.54 --> 114.54]  This?
[114.54 --> 115.54]  Yeah, for that
[115.54 --> 116.54]  Well for that
[116.54 --> 117.54]  That was in like one of your main compartments of your back then
[117.54 --> 118.54]  Shut up
[118.54 --> 119.54]  Neither of us could find it we were both looking for it
[119.54 --> 120.54]  Yeah
[120.54 --> 121.54]  Good job Nick
[121.54 --> 122.54]  Magic hands
[122.54 --> 123.54]  Magic hands
[123.54 --> 124.54]  Magic hands
[124.54 --> 125.54]  Oh
[125.54 --> 126.54]  Oops I clicked the wrong thing
[126.54 --> 127.54]  Uh
[127.54 --> 128.54]  Uh
[128.54 --> 129.54]  Uh
[129.54 --> 131.54]  Okay back on the oh oh no terrible everything's terrible
[131.54 --> 132.54]  What are you doing?
[132.54 --> 134.54]  Uh hold on hold on I got this
[134.54 --> 135.54]  Uh
[135.54 --> 136.54]  Uh
[136.54 --> 137.54]  Okay there
[137.54 --> 138.54]  What?
[138.54 --> 139.54]  And uh
[139.54 --> 140.54]  Sponsors
[140.54 --> 141.54]  Why do you have a NASCAR hat on?
[141.54 --> 142.54]  There we go don't worry about it
[142.54 --> 144.54]  Don't worry about the NASCAR hat
[144.54 --> 146.54]  There's reasons that will be revealed at another time
[146.54 --> 147.54]  Yeah
[147.54 --> 150.54]  Reas- it has nothing to do with scrapyard wars
[150.54 --> 152.54]  Or the closed toed shoes
[152.54 --> 153.54]  Yeah
[153.54 --> 156.54]  The fact that these guys are here also has nothing to do with it
[156.54 --> 157.54]  Yes nothing to do with scrapyard wars
[157.54 --> 158.54]  We flew in for Wansho and Wansho only
[158.54 --> 159.54]  Okay
[159.54 --> 160.54]  So actually
[160.54 --> 163.54]  I think that's probably a great topic for us to start with
[163.54 --> 164.54]  Uh guys
[164.54 --> 167.54]  Get amped about the upcoming season of scrapyard wars
[167.54 --> 168.54]  Yeah
[168.54 --> 171.54]  It's probably not gonna be out for like
[171.54 --> 173.54]  Six weeks to eight weeks
[173.54 --> 175.54]  Like I'm talking first episode
[175.54 --> 178.54]  But it's our Christmas present to you
[178.54 --> 180.54]  It'll be out first on float plane
[180.54 --> 182.54]  And it'll be out first on float plane
[182.54 --> 183.54]  I'll take those victories
[183.54 --> 184.54]  By that time
[184.54 --> 185.54]  Float plane
[185.54 --> 186.54]  Nope let's not go with that
[186.54 --> 189.54]  Float plane might not even exist anymore for all we know
[189.54 --> 190.54]  Who knows
[190.54 --> 191.54]  Um
[191.54 --> 192.54]  But uh what I will say
[192.54 --> 193.54]  I'm you know
[193.54 --> 195.54]  There's gonna be no spoilers on the show today you guys
[195.54 --> 202.54]  But what I will say is a huge thank you to uh Jay and Dimitri for flying all the way up here
[202.54 --> 204.54]  The pleasure was all ours
[204.54 --> 205.54]  Yes thank you for the invite
[205.54 --> 206.54]  Cool
[206.54 --> 207.54]  I'm uh yeah it was like
[207.54 --> 208.54]  We had a lot of fun
[208.54 --> 212.54]  So that's that's the only spoiler I'll give you guys is it was a ton of fun
[212.54 --> 215.54]  And uh yeah you know what that's it
[215.54 --> 218.54]  That's it so and now radio silence
[218.54 --> 221.54]  And don't even bother trying to get anything out of these guys
[221.54 --> 224.54]  Because they know the scrapyard wars code
[224.54 --> 225.54]  Yeah
[225.54 --> 227.54]  Say something and die
[227.54 --> 229.54]  I mean
[229.54 --> 230.54]  It's more like
[230.54 --> 231.54]  Um
[231.54 --> 232.54]  What is it
[232.54 --> 237.54]  A say umthing say and a I day
[237.54 --> 241.54]  You know we'll go with the pig Latin version of the code
[241.54 --> 242.54]  But yeah
[242.54 --> 244.54]  I just like that we left it where it's it's
[244.54 --> 245.54]  That's it in a nutshell
[245.54 --> 246.54]  Um
[246.54 --> 248.54]  Alright so guys
[248.54 --> 253.54]  First uh first article today this was posted by stay ass on the forum and the original article here
[253.54 --> 255.54]  How do I click a link on a Mac?
[255.54 --> 256.54]  What the hell is this?
[256.54 --> 257.54]  Yes!
[257.54 --> 258.54]  Okay
[258.54 --> 259.54]  Okay
[259.54 --> 260.54]  Uh yeah no spoilers
[260.54 --> 261.54]  Okay
[261.54 --> 262.54]  I just wanna
[262.54 --> 263.54]  Now it works
[263.54 --> 264.54]  What the heck?
[264.54 --> 265.54]  Just don't push too hard
[265.54 --> 266.54]  You have to do the force press
[266.54 --> 267.54]  Oh
[267.54 --> 268.54]  What why?
[268.54 --> 269.54]  Press?
[269.54 --> 270.54]  I know
[270.54 --> 274.54]  I go to use the touch screen to zoom and it's like
[274.54 --> 275.54]  No you'll have to do
[275.54 --> 276.54]  Ah
[276.54 --> 278.54]  I want my computer back
[278.54 --> 279.54]  Okay anyway
[279.54 --> 280.54]  Anyway
[280.54 --> 281.54]  Um
[281.54 --> 284.54]  A.I.B. Partners to Gamers Nexus
[284.54 --> 285.54]  This was posted by Steve Burke
[285.54 --> 286.54]  You know Steve right?
[286.54 --> 287.54]  Yeah yeah
[287.54 --> 288.54]  You know Steven? Yeah okay
[288.54 --> 289.54]  Uh
[289.54 --> 290.54]  Gibbo was right
[290.54 --> 291.54]  I like that guy
[291.54 --> 292.54]  About AMD price changing
[292.54 --> 293.54]  I like his hair
[293.54 --> 294.54]  AMD basically came out of the gate
[294.54 --> 295.54]  That's awesome
[295.54 --> 297.54]  With Vega 56 and Vega 64
[297.54 --> 299.54]  With an I think you guys in your reviews
[299.54 --> 300.54]  Probably agreed
[300.54 --> 301.54]  Hmm
[301.54 --> 302.54]  Vega 64 looks
[302.54 --> 303.54]  Okay
[303.54 --> 305.54]  Other than being a couple years late
[305.54 --> 308.54]  Because it's basically an overclocked 980 Ti
[308.54 --> 311.54]  And Vega 56 looks pretty good
[311.54 --> 313.54]  It's the $400 king
[313.54 --> 314.54]  Okay
[314.54 --> 315.54]  For compute anyway
[315.54 --> 316.54]  Okay
[316.54 --> 318.54]  So now
[318.54 --> 319.54]  It looks like
[319.54 --> 331.54]  Launch price of Vega 64 was supposed to be $500 but quickly shot to $600 in the wake of immediate inventory selling out
[331.54 --> 332.54]  So is this actual MSRP?
[332.54 --> 333.54]  Yep
[333.54 --> 334.54]  So is this actual MSRP?
[334.54 --> 335.54]  And
[335.54 --> 337.54]  Or is this just stores reacting?
[337.54 --> 339.54]  I'm going with the latter
[339.54 --> 340.54]  Yeah
[340.54 --> 342.54]  Let's see
[342.54 --> 345.54]  Cause we can't really blame them for that
[345.54 --> 346.54]  So this is interesting
[346.54 --> 347.54]  What does AMD website say?
[347.54 --> 348.54]  What does AMD website say?
[348.54 --> 349.54]  What does AMD website say?
[349.54 --> 358.54]  AMD provided the top retailers and e-tailers with a $499 price on Vega 64 coupling sale of the card with a rebate to reduce spend by retailers
[358.54 --> 362.54]  So basically that's like it's usually called like a POS rebate
[362.54 --> 364.54]  A point of sale rebate
[364.54 --> 368.54]  Apparently the rebate is already expiring
[368.54 --> 371.54]  Hence the price jump by retailers
[371.54 --> 372.54]  Oh
[372.54 --> 373.54]  It was that fast
[373.54 --> 377.54]  Yeah well see this is something that is kind of not public knowledge
[377.54 --> 378.54]  This is more
[378.54 --> 381.54]  And I'm sure I'm over like the statute of limitations
[381.54 --> 384.54]  For my old job as a product manager
[384.54 --> 386.54]  But it is
[386.54 --> 390.54]  It is pretty tight
[390.54 --> 392.54]  To be an AMD partner
[392.54 --> 393.54]  Mm-hmm
[393.54 --> 396.54]  I've gotten a lot of feedback in the industry over the years
[396.54 --> 400.54]  Being an Nvidia add-in card partner
[400.54 --> 401.54]  I think they call them AIBs
[401.54 --> 403.54]  And I think AMD calls them AICs
[403.54 --> 405.54]  Add-in card versus add-in board
[405.54 --> 406.54]  Right
[406.54 --> 409.54]  Being an Nvidia partner versus an AMD partner
[409.54 --> 411.54]  Is supposedly a lot better
[411.54 --> 413.54]  Now XFX
[413.54 --> 414.54]  You guys probably remember this
[414.54 --> 415.54]  Yeah
[415.54 --> 416.54]  When did they jump ship?
[416.54 --> 418.54]  What was AMD?
[418.54 --> 419.54]  Yeah
[419.54 --> 420.54]  Like
[420.54 --> 421.54]  Wasn't it like 4000 series?
[421.54 --> 422.54]  Like 6,000
[422.54 --> 423.54]  Oh sorry
[423.54 --> 424.54]  6000 series AICs
[424.54 --> 425.54]  Oh no it was 4000 series
[425.54 --> 426.54]  I think you're right
[426.54 --> 427.54]  So it was like
[427.54 --> 429.54]  So that was when AMD looked
[429.54 --> 431.54]  Because they were competing against
[431.54 --> 435.54]  Was that the 480 generation?
[435.54 --> 436.54]  Or had they just
[436.54 --> 438.54]  They just hadn't refreshed in forever?
[438.54 --> 439.54]  They just hadn't refreshed in forever?
[439.54 --> 440.54]  Basically
[440.54 --> 442.54]  They turned tail on Nvidia
[442.54 --> 444.54]  And they went to AMD
[444.54 --> 445.54]  And
[445.54 --> 447.54]  My understanding is that
[447.54 --> 449.54]  It's been pretty rough over there
[449.54 --> 452.54]  Is all I can really say
[452.54 --> 454.54]  But what are your guys' thoughts
[454.54 --> 458.54]  On the pricing of Vega 64 in particular
[458.54 --> 459.54]  It looks like here
[459.54 --> 461.54]  Having effectively been increased?
[461.54 --> 466.54]  I think it's only going to be beneficial for those that are using the compute performance honestly
[466.54 --> 467.54]  Not as a gaming card
[467.54 --> 468.54]  Right
[468.54 --> 469.54]  Because at that point it makes no sense
[469.54 --> 472.54]  Now you're talking 1080ti pricing which dominates it in games
[473.54 --> 476.54]  But at the exact same time
[476.54 --> 477.54]  Not in terms of making sense
[477.54 --> 482.54]  But AMD right now has a very aggressive very dedicated fan base
[482.54 --> 483.54]  That's true
[483.54 --> 485.54]  So it might not even matter
[485.54 --> 487.54]  My concern with this though was that
[487.54 --> 491.54]  That fan base is usually though attached to the performance per dollar aspect of being an AMD fan
[491.54 --> 492.54]  And that's not here
[492.54 --> 496.54]  Yeah but AMD has put a lot of work into making it a rebellious stance
[496.54 --> 499.54]  Instead of just necessarily a performance per dollar
[499.54 --> 501.54]  Because they were definitely performance per dollar
[501.54 --> 505.54]  Like with the 3000 series Intel processors
[505.54 --> 508.54]  And like a couple generations back
[508.54 --> 510.54]  With like 200 series AMD graphics cards
[510.54 --> 512.54]  But more recently I feel like they've been shifting it
[512.54 --> 515.54]  I think the bigger question here
[515.54 --> 516.54]  You can totally be right though
[516.54 --> 517.54]  I think the bigger question here
[517.54 --> 519.54]  The one that affects our audience
[519.54 --> 521.54]  And the one that affects us as reviewers more
[521.54 --> 524.54]  Is this artificial rebate
[524.54 --> 526.54]  That's only valid for
[526.54 --> 528.54]  I mean the card only launched what a week ago?
[528.54 --> 532.54]  So a rebate that they're putting on the card for a week
[532.54 --> 536.54]  To hit a price that isn't sustainable
[536.54 --> 539.54]  That affects your conclusion about the card and yours
[539.54 --> 540.54]  Absolutely
[540.54 --> 542.54]  And it's not like especially as YouTubers
[542.54 --> 545.54]  It's not like we can go back and edit our article
[545.54 --> 548.54]  Be like yeah the price to performance sucks donkey balls now
[548.54 --> 550.54]  And not to flatter ourselves
[550.54 --> 552.54]  But that's where a lot of research is happening right now
[552.54 --> 555.54]  Is YouTube especially for people that are getting new into computers
[555.54 --> 559.54]  And might not think to check a whole bunch of different sites
[559.54 --> 561.54]  Like written sites that can be updated
[561.54 --> 562.54]  Like Gamers Nexus guy
[562.54 --> 563.54]  We just talked about him
[563.54 --> 565.54]  He might say in his video
[565.54 --> 567.54]  Pricing and stuff is on our website
[567.54 --> 568.54]  I've seen him say that before
[568.54 --> 569.54]  So that they can update it
[569.54 --> 570.54]  And that's cool
[570.54 --> 571.54]  But even then
[571.54 --> 573.54]  Like for something like a 499
[573.54 --> 574.54]  The feeling changes
[574.54 --> 576.54]  Yeah like a budget graphics card
[576.54 --> 577.54]  Where they're going like
[577.54 --> 579.54]  We're the new 499
[579.54 --> 581.54]  Or 399 king
[581.54 --> 582.54]  399 king
[582.54 --> 584.54]  And then if we
[584.54 --> 585.54]  If our conclusion is
[585.54 --> 587.54]  Check the link in the description
[587.54 --> 589.54]  For price for the most up to date pricing on Amazon
[589.54 --> 590.54]  I knew it I'm stupid
[590.54 --> 591.54]  But we say
[591.54 --> 594.54]  Yeah AMD's positioned this card really well
[594.54 --> 596.54]  It's performance looks great
[596.54 --> 597.54]  And the value is great
[598.54 --> 601.54]  If it's 80 or 100 dollars more expensive
[601.54 --> 602.54]  I feel like what they've done is
[602.54 --> 605.54]  They've made Nvidia feel like a more compelling deal
[605.54 --> 607.54]  Or budget at that point
[607.54 --> 609.54]  I mean because 1070 right competes against 56
[609.54 --> 611.54]  And 56 was beating 1070
[611.54 --> 612.54]  Pretty much across the board
[612.54 --> 614.54]  But now you increase that price
[614.54 --> 615.54]  Why would I want a 56
[615.54 --> 616.54]  Unless I'm going compute
[616.54 --> 618.54]  I mean if I can use the compute
[618.54 --> 619.54]  Aspect of it
[619.54 --> 620.54]  Then yeah it dominates
[620.54 --> 622.54]  Both of them dominate what Nvidia has to offer
[622.54 --> 623.54]  But the question is
[623.54 --> 625.54]  How many of these buyers are actually buying them for compute
[625.54 --> 627.54]  Or to be a part of that rebellion nation
[627.54 --> 628.54]  Yeah
[628.54 --> 632.54]  Also will this affect any of the bundle stuff that AMD is putting up
[632.54 --> 633.54]  It would have to right?
[633.54 --> 634.54]  Yeah
[634.54 --> 635.54]  It would have to
[635.54 --> 636.54]  So the bundles would have to go up by 100 bucks too
[636.54 --> 637.54]  Yeah
[637.54 --> 638.54]  I feel like yeah the bundles would just go up
[638.54 --> 639.54]  And I don't think anything else would change
[639.54 --> 641.54]  I don't think the bundles are going to get any better
[641.54 --> 642.54]  I think the bundles were a terrible LED to begin with
[642.54 --> 646.54]  I just really don't like being screwed around with like this
[646.54 --> 647.54]  Yeah
[647.54 --> 649.54]  I don't like being manipulated in a way where
[649.54 --> 650.54]  Like there's a couple things
[650.54 --> 651.54]  And you know what?
[651.54 --> 653.54]  It's one of those things where I'm not just going to crap on AMD for this
[653.54 --> 655.54]  Like you and I have talked about this offline
[655.54 --> 656.54]  I think I might have mentioned it to you
[656.54 --> 659.54]  But I was really really displeased
[659.54 --> 663.54]  When Nvidia had a separate unboxing embargo
[663.54 --> 664.54]  Wow
[664.54 --> 665.54]  For the 1080 Ti
[665.54 --> 667.54]  Because you know what that is
[667.54 --> 669.54]  That's Nvidia saying
[669.54 --> 670.54]  Max?
[670.54 --> 672.54]  Do you need some help over there?
[672.54 --> 673.54]  Maybe
[673.54 --> 674.54]  No
[674.54 --> 675.54]  What are we changing?
[675.54 --> 676.54]  I don't know
[676.54 --> 678.54]  It looks tilted and I had to fix it
[678.54 --> 679.54]  Okay
[679.54 --> 680.54]  It's
[680.54 --> 681.54]  Linus is going to focus now
[681.54 --> 683.54]  I really would have just maybe left it
[683.54 --> 685.54]  Also point it towards Linus a little bit more
[685.54 --> 687.54]  That's a bit better
[687.54 --> 689.54]  Okay, okay
[689.54 --> 690.54]  Let's just
[690.54 --> 691.54]  Let's not touch it anymore
[691.54 --> 692.54]  Okay
[692.54 --> 694.54]  Thanks Max
[694.54 --> 696.54]  Okay, what were we talking about again?
[696.54 --> 697.54]  You were talking about the unboxing
[697.54 --> 698.54]  Right
[698.54 --> 699.54]  Okay
[699.54 --> 700.54]  So there were a couple things wrong with that
[700.54 --> 701.54]  Number one
[701.54 --> 704.54]  Was that Paul had already done an unboxing at the event
[704.54 --> 705.54]  And that's nothing against Paul
[705.54 --> 706.54]  Yeah, because why not?
[706.54 --> 707.54]  Super cool
[707.54 --> 708.54]  Fairplay
[708.54 --> 709.54]  But I think they saw the traction that that sort of got
[709.54 --> 710.54]  No problem
[710.54 --> 711.54]  And then they came up with the idea of like
[711.54 --> 712.54]  Oh, we better reel this in
[712.54 --> 713.54]  And you know
[713.54 --> 714.54]  Put an embargo on this
[714.54 --> 716.54]  Because what they're trying to get
[716.54 --> 718.54]  Because that effectively what they're getting
[718.54 --> 720.54]  When they do a launch event
[720.54 --> 721.54]  We all accept it
[721.54 --> 724.54]  Because it gives us access to talk to the developers
[724.54 --> 725.54]  Of the product
[725.54 --> 726.54]  Right
[726.54 --> 728.54]  In a way that we don't get to on just a conference call
[728.54 --> 730.54]  It's a lot more helpful than a conference call
[730.54 --> 731.54]  Yeah
[731.54 --> 734.54]  So we all accept these events that they do
[734.54 --> 737.54]  Because it's also an opportunity to network within the industry
[737.54 --> 738.54]  Most of the time I've spent with you guys
[738.54 --> 740.54]  It has been at industry events
[740.54 --> 743.54]  But what's really frustrating
[743.54 --> 748.54]  Is that NVIDIA controls the narrative at that point
[748.54 --> 749.54]  Because any news story
[749.54 --> 751.54]  And we have to do a news story
[751.54 --> 753.54]  Because everybody else is going to do a news story
[753.54 --> 754.54]  Right
[754.54 --> 755.54]  So that's my upload that day
[755.54 --> 756.54]  That's Jay's upload that day
[756.54 --> 757.54]  That's Dimitri's upload that day
[757.54 --> 760.54]  That's other content that might be more meaningful
[760.54 --> 764.54]  Because it's not just regurgitating the same information everybody has
[764.54 --> 765.54]  That isn't going up
[765.54 --> 767.54]  Because we're busy traveling for a day
[767.54 --> 768.54]  Yeah
[768.54 --> 769.54]  Spending a day at an event
[769.54 --> 771.54]  And then traveling back for another day
[771.54 --> 773.54]  We just spent 1% of our year
[773.54 --> 775.54]  On this event
[775.54 --> 778.54]  To make the same piece of content that everybody else is making
[778.54 --> 779.54]  For me personally
[779.54 --> 780.54]  And there can be some
[780.54 --> 781.54]  Okay
[781.54 --> 782.54]  I'm not a huge fan
[782.54 --> 784.54]  I'm not a huge fan
[784.54 --> 785.54]  To do that
[785.54 --> 786.54]  Because people might have different opinions
[786.54 --> 787.54]  Or insights
[787.54 --> 788.54]  Or ideas
[788.54 --> 789.54]  About how something might be used
[789.54 --> 790.54]  Blah blah blah
[790.54 --> 791.54]  But it's a lot
[791.54 --> 792.54]  It's a lot to put on one item
[792.54 --> 794.54]  And when you have to do just an unboxing
[794.54 --> 798.54]  It's pretty unlikely that you'll have a lot of unique insights
[798.54 --> 805.00]  Well, not even that. This is kind of off topic a little bit, but then it goes as far as starting to break down the information.
[805.54 --> 808.98]  Like, you can get this piece of information, we get this piece later, this piece tomorrow, right?
[809.00 --> 811.58]  The pricing issue that happened with 1080 Ti, which was a huge issue.
[811.58 --> 812.16]  That was a huge issue.
[812.46 --> 812.60]  Yeah.
[812.74 --> 819.82]  So what this looks like to me, because NVIDIA is effectively getting marketing out of bringing people to this event.
[820.04 --> 824.50]  They're just regurgitating whatever was on NVIDIA's slides because that's all the information we have so far.
[824.50 --> 832.10]  We don't have any benchmarks, like how fast is the Uber car 10,000 or whatever.
[832.80 --> 836.76]  So then there's that date. Let's say March 1st for the sake of argument.
[837.36 --> 840.74]  Then March 14th would be the review embargo, typically.
[841.08 --> 843.06]  Or, yeah, like they ever give us two weeks, right?
[843.28 --> 845.56]  Maybe like March 8th would be the review embargo.
[845.70 --> 850.04]  That gives us a week to get back home, test it, formulate our opinions, and go,
[850.16 --> 853.00]  Okay, that thing we talked about a week ago, here's the real skinny.
[853.00 --> 857.66]  Now they're putting this additional day, a few days later, where they're going,
[857.76 --> 859.42]  Okay, now you can publish your unboxing.
[859.80 --> 861.10]  Here's the problem with that.
[861.38 --> 865.32]  The unboxing contains no information that's new.
[865.58 --> 865.78]  Yeah.
[866.02 --> 867.92]  And especially when it's not even retail packaging.
[868.26 --> 868.46]  Yeah.
[868.62 --> 870.38]  It's just a physical showcase.
[872.10 --> 873.02]  It's just a glamour video.
[873.12 --> 877.74]  I think they should be paying for that because effectively what they're getting is marketing.
[877.74 --> 885.78]  So when NVIDIA sent us an embargo for an unboxing of the 1080 Ti, I basically sent them back an angry email.
[886.12 --> 887.24]  Went, this is BS.
[887.58 --> 889.66]  You guys are asking for free advertising.
[890.28 --> 890.68]  No.
[892.06 --> 892.80]  NVIDIA, no.
[893.28 --> 894.54]  NVIDIA, no.
[894.58 --> 895.30]  Hard no, right?
[895.30 --> 895.58]  Yeah.
[895.74 --> 895.86]  Yeah.
[896.04 --> 896.18]  Yeah.
[896.64 --> 901.16]  So AMD went and pulled the same thing with Threadripper on the CPU side.
[901.56 --> 907.10]  And then on the GPU side, honestly, this feels even worse in some way.
[907.26 --> 915.80]  Because instead of asking for free marketing, what they've done is they've manipulated the conclusions of what is supposed to be an independent evaluation.
[915.80 --> 916.60]  Yeah.
[917.56 --> 919.96]  I mean, like you said, it's so close to the launch date.
[920.68 --> 923.58]  I mean, our reviews are still not even cooled off yet.
[924.20 --> 924.54]  Right, yeah.
[924.54 --> 927.24]  And now the whole budget factor of it is just wrong.
[928.06 --> 933.26]  And, like, I'm sure one, maybe two guys will make a video about that.
[933.52 --> 933.80]  Right.
[934.34 --> 934.54]  Yeah.
[934.62 --> 936.26]  But there's only enough space for that.
[936.52 --> 936.68]  Yeah.
[936.68 --> 939.34]  Because, honestly, most people in the audience won't really care.
[940.10 --> 944.00]  They won't care in terms of, like, oh, I'm going to watch all of these videos because I'm that interested.
[944.16 --> 944.62]  You know what I mean?
[944.70 --> 944.88]  Nope.
[944.88 --> 949.02]  So then it's the ROI on making one of those isn't really there for the creators.
[949.12 --> 950.40]  So then they're probably not going to make it.
[950.58 --> 950.78]  Yep.
[951.04 --> 956.44]  Is the rebate information available to the reviewers until a certain point?
[956.46 --> 957.54]  I didn't know anything about no rebate.
[957.88 --> 958.04]  Yeah.
[958.12 --> 959.58]  I didn't know anything about it.
[959.70 --> 962.36]  And I didn't know that it was going to be expiring after a week.
[962.88 --> 963.18]  Yeah.
[963.78 --> 967.02]  If they had been up front about that, then this is a totally different conversation.
[967.02 --> 969.34]  And that's not even...
[969.34 --> 973.44]  It doesn't even mention the fact that they only launched with bundles to begin with anyway.
[973.74 --> 973.84]  Yeah.
[973.84 --> 975.74]  It was really hard to find a card by itself.
[976.12 --> 977.58]  The bundles were the only thing you could find.
[977.62 --> 978.76]  All the retailers were doing bundles.
[979.24 --> 979.40]  Yep.
[979.46 --> 986.52]  And I mean, like, if we want to keep going on about grievances with the RX Vega launch, you know, when did you get your Vega 56?
[989.46 --> 990.62]  Friday before the launch.
[990.62 --> 991.04]  Yeah.
[991.04 --> 994.86]  So we got it Friday morning before, what was it, a Monday 6 a.m. launch?
[994.98 --> 995.06]  Yeah.
[995.26 --> 999.10]  So if anyone from AMD is watching, I'm going to break this down for you.
[999.72 --> 1003.02]  Saturday and Sunday are both considered weekends.
[1003.02 --> 1011.06]  And it is fairly typical for people who have a life or a family or both.
[1011.90 --> 1013.18]  I don't know if anyone has both.
[1013.44 --> 1013.96]  Or none.
[1013.96 --> 1016.80]  Can you have a life and a family?
[1017.62 --> 1018.22]  Okay, whatever.
[1018.32 --> 1018.80]  Not the point.
[1018.86 --> 1019.12]  The point.
[1019.48 --> 1027.38]  The point is that those two days are weekend days, which are generally considered the days that you spend having a life or having a family.
[1027.76 --> 1028.00]  Right.
[1028.44 --> 1030.06]  So then we have to make the choice, right?
[1030.28 --> 1034.08]  So I have to tell my wife and my kids last minute, like, hey, I've got to work all day Saturday.
[1034.28 --> 1036.98]  Oh, and by the way, I'm going to be leaving for a whole week right after that.
[1037.54 --> 1039.56]  You know, so I lose a whole Saturday with them.
[1039.92 --> 1040.12]  Yep.
[1040.26 --> 1045.38]  And literally that was, we just added a whole sixth workday to the week just to handle that.
[1045.38 --> 1048.64]  Well, you could just, you could just wait and you could, you could just publish.
[1048.76 --> 1049.36]  So here's the thing.
[1049.42 --> 1053.78]  We had Vega 64 like a week before and we had the drivers and everything.
[1053.78 --> 1060.00]  And we were told that Vega 56 was going to be coming, was going to be lifted way later.
[1060.00 --> 1060.20]  Right.
[1060.52 --> 1061.56]  Like quite a bit later.
[1061.74 --> 1064.80]  So we weren't, so we were like, we were like, yeah, everything's fine.
[1064.92 --> 1067.94]  And then a car literally arrived here Friday morning.
[1068.36 --> 1069.00]  A Vega 56.
[1069.10 --> 1070.26]  And I was like, what are we supposed to do with this?
[1070.26 --> 1071.98]  What did they message asking to prioritize it?
[1072.90 --> 1073.98]  Did they for you?
[1074.18 --> 1074.34]  Yeah.
[1074.72 --> 1078.16]  Oh, I don't, I think we didn't get that until like even later in the day.
[1078.34 --> 1080.74]  Yeah, no, the message was 56 is coming.
[1081.12 --> 1082.64]  Please, please prioritize it if you can.
[1082.64 --> 1083.88]  I got a new driver on the weekend.
[1084.92 --> 1085.28]  Yeah.
[1085.46 --> 1086.52]  No, no, you're absolutely right.
[1086.62 --> 1090.84]  And remember guys, this is a 6 a.m. Pacific launch time.
[1091.50 --> 1092.96]  So you have to be done the night before.
[1092.96 --> 1097.80]  So you actually have to be rendering your video by like Sunday evening.
[1099.08 --> 1100.44]  Because there might be errors.
[1100.52 --> 1102.52]  Somebody thinks you have to correct the render might not work.
[1102.68 --> 1104.92]  There might be edits you have to make because of a problem.
[1105.26 --> 1107.80]  Terran's very intimately familiar with this.
[1108.78 --> 1108.98]  Yeah.
[1108.98 --> 1109.54]  So.
[1110.54 --> 1113.34]  Well, it's kind of like right before the new CPU platform launches too, right?
[1113.38 --> 1116.32]  How many BIOS updates are there like up to the day of launch?
[1116.84 --> 1118.20]  I would be, it's really funny.
[1118.28 --> 1122.90]  People are joking in the Twitch chat about like YouTube or union or something like that.
[1123.64 --> 1125.38]  Here is an interesting thought.
[1125.76 --> 1126.56]  Oh, I'm directly.
[1126.56 --> 1133.60]  What if every tech guy on YouTube got together and said, no, screw your embargo.
[1134.38 --> 1135.62]  We'll go when we're all ready.
[1136.16 --> 1137.52]  I've kind of started doing that.
[1138.24 --> 1140.88]  Vega is the first actual embargo date I've hit in a long time.
[1141.02 --> 1141.90]  Threadriber I didn't hit.
[1142.02 --> 1144.24]  Ryzen 3, 5, and 7 I didn't hit.
[1144.36 --> 1144.96]  Intel I didn't hit.
[1144.96 --> 1147.80]  We usually go for like two, three days after everybody publishes.
[1147.80 --> 1151.44]  Two, three weeks sometimes because I'm tired of the situation like Linus is talking about
[1151.44 --> 1153.32]  and what you're talking about with last minute drivers and stuff.
[1153.40 --> 1156.04]  That I just wait for things to kind of settle and then I go into it.
[1156.10 --> 1158.82]  Start making a like review embargo alliance.
[1159.38 --> 1159.80]  Yeah.
[1160.38 --> 1161.56]  Review embargo alliance.
[1161.56 --> 1168.24]  Because like we had to pull in multiple people on a Saturday to come in basically because
[1168.24 --> 1173.94]  the video was completely done by the time we had a Vega 56 in our hand.
[1173.98 --> 1174.42]  By me.
[1174.50 --> 1174.68]  Yeah.
[1174.90 --> 1175.06]  Yeah.
[1175.22 --> 1179.24]  So Terran's over there informing us that it was indeed him that edited it all too.
[1179.38 --> 1179.52]  Yeah.
[1179.66 --> 1181.86]  So now he has like that didn't get to go anywhere.
[1182.40 --> 1185.46]  I've just gotten so sick and tired of all the last minute changes and the way it actually
[1185.46 --> 1190.98]  changes the whole landscape that I've just decided like I'm no longer going to abide by the
[1190.98 --> 1192.12]  embargo dates trying to hit them.
[1192.22 --> 1193.22]  If I'm late, that's fine.
[1193.30 --> 1195.22]  Enough of my audience is willing to wait and watch it anyway.
[1195.46 --> 1195.64]  Yeah.
[1195.74 --> 1198.68]  But I'm tired of feeling like I'm just an extension of someone else's marketing team.
[1199.04 --> 1200.14]  So tell me this.
[1201.70 --> 1202.28]  Oh shoot.
[1202.32 --> 1204.10]  I completely lost track of what I was going to say there.
[1204.46 --> 1204.92]  Bloody hell.
[1205.10 --> 1205.34]  Sorry.
[1205.40 --> 1206.10]  It's been a long week.
[1207.74 --> 1208.46]  It has.
[1208.62 --> 1210.44]  Something, something, embargo.
[1210.74 --> 1211.86]  Something, embargo, union.
[1212.50 --> 1212.90]  Yeah.
[1213.32 --> 1214.76]  Something, something, et cetera.
[1215.22 --> 1215.42]  Yeah.
[1215.48 --> 1215.80]  Forget it.
[1215.80 --> 1216.30]  I got nothing.
[1216.30 --> 1219.86]  So basically I'm frustrated.
[1220.08 --> 1220.54]  It's stupid.
[1220.54 --> 1222.76]  And I've had enough of this crap.
[1224.20 --> 1226.04]  Oh, now I'm really frustrated.
[1226.18 --> 1229.20]  It was like a, it was like a great discussion thing.
[1229.28 --> 1230.08]  I was really looking forward to what you guys were going to say.
[1230.08 --> 1233.14]  To talk about something very temporarily while you can try to think about that.
[1233.24 --> 1236.98]  Do you want to talk about what the, the, the premise or the rules were for the Scrappy
[1236.98 --> 1237.22]  Yard Wars?
[1237.30 --> 1237.48]  Yeah.
[1237.56 --> 1237.98]  Go ahead.
[1238.26 --> 1238.64]  Go ahead.
[1238.68 --> 1238.80]  Hit it.
[1238.80 --> 1242.76]  So for this Scrappy Yard Wars, the idea was instead of starting at the office and working
[1242.76 --> 1246.14]  out of the office the entire time like we have in the past, we had two teams.
[1246.24 --> 1247.14]  Should we say what the teams were?
[1247.26 --> 1247.46]  Yeah.
[1247.60 --> 1247.76]  Absolutely.
[1248.02 --> 1248.74]  That's already public.
[1248.74 --> 1249.74]  Oh, okay.
[1249.80 --> 1249.96]  Yeah.
[1250.02 --> 1250.92]  So, oh, right.
[1250.96 --> 1251.60]  That makes sense.
[1251.60 --> 1253.70]  So it was myself and Jay and Linus and Dimitri.
[1253.94 --> 1258.56]  And we started out actually in the city of Vancouver, which is about an hour from here.
[1258.56 --> 1261.74]  And we had a fair amount of cash.
[1262.04 --> 1263.62]  I'm not going to say how much, but a fair amount of cash.
[1263.68 --> 1267.26]  But some of that cash had to be allocated to food and water.
[1268.04 --> 1269.32]  You had no budget for food.
[1269.40 --> 1270.60]  You couldn't just buy food.
[1270.86 --> 1273.70]  Normally in Scrappy Yard Wars, you could buy whatever food you wanted while you were going
[1273.70 --> 1274.48]  with your own money.
[1274.98 --> 1275.70]  But this time.
[1275.90 --> 1276.76]  To be fair, it didn't have to.
[1276.90 --> 1277.32]  It's just.
[1277.74 --> 1279.06]  It's allocated from your budget.
[1279.28 --> 1279.42]  Yeah.
[1279.42 --> 1280.34]  Anything you spent.
[1280.88 --> 1283.00]  Anything you needed to do at the day had to come out of that budget.
[1283.10 --> 1285.92]  If you wanted to bike somewhere, you'd have to buy or rent a bike.
[1286.04 --> 1290.26]  If you wanted to transit somewhere further out, you'd have to get a bus pass or a transit
[1290.26 --> 1293.00]  pass of some sort or get a cab or whatever.
[1293.78 --> 1294.36]  So, yeah.
[1294.42 --> 1296.56]  It was a very interesting setup.
[1296.80 --> 1301.54]  Both teams decided to go at it in certain ways that I'm not going to describe because
[1301.54 --> 1303.06]  I'm worried about going too deeply into it.
[1303.06 --> 1303.88]  But, yeah.
[1303.96 --> 1304.92]  It was very interesting.
[1305.06 --> 1306.78]  Quite a bit different from any other Scrapyard Wars.
[1306.78 --> 1307.66]  I took a drink from an empty cup.
[1309.68 --> 1313.08]  I'm just laughing at all the GetJ water comments because I took a drink from an empty cup.
[1313.14 --> 1313.52]  I was like, oh.
[1316.10 --> 1318.82]  I'm trying to make up for all the water that, you know, we needed.
[1319.16 --> 1319.52]  Yes.
[1319.82 --> 1320.12]  Yeah.
[1320.36 --> 1321.38]  Don't spoil it.
[1322.06 --> 1322.96]  Water doesn't spoil.
[1324.14 --> 1324.80]  Spoil what?
[1325.00 --> 1325.80]  No, the sp...
[1325.80 --> 1327.08]  Don't say it.
[1327.08 --> 1327.46]  You figured out what?
[1327.46 --> 1328.00]  Don't say it.
[1328.00 --> 1328.40]  Yeah.
[1328.62 --> 1332.48]  I never figured out what it was, but I had really just wanted to talk a little bit more about
[1332.48 --> 1336.48]  sort of how they're handling it and how it's...
[1337.56 --> 1339.12]  We've had to do it before.
[1339.34 --> 1340.64]  We've had to delay videos.
[1340.80 --> 1345.82]  We've missed embargoes, which are fairly important, but we've found not the most important thing.
[1345.90 --> 1348.82]  And sometimes it helps if there does happen to be a change.
[1348.96 --> 1349.16]  Yeah.
[1349.26 --> 1352.24]  Because then we can talk about the change and that one video will pick up traction.
[1352.24 --> 1359.58]  But it's usually only us or only Jay or only Dimitri or only one type of creator that's
[1359.58 --> 1361.48]  making that one delayed video.
[1361.48 --> 1364.80]  I do wonder what the fallout would be.
[1364.86 --> 1369.30]  Not really fallout, but what would the impact be if suddenly the entire tech scene on YouTube
[1369.30 --> 1371.48]  just said, no, we're not going to hit your embargo.
[1372.42 --> 1375.96]  We all collectively say, we'll wait two weeks to see where things land.
[1376.44 --> 1378.62]  Because we'd still be in that window of AMD pulling this.
[1378.78 --> 1379.96]  Or would they just postpone this?
[1380.58 --> 1381.48]  I don't know.
[1381.48 --> 1382.94]  I don't know how they'd react.
[1383.00 --> 1384.76]  Because I told them, I think you guys should push it.
[1386.20 --> 1388.18]  I think they might think initially.
[1388.50 --> 1389.82]  Especially something like NVIDIA, right?
[1389.82 --> 1391.74]  They might think that there's not going to be any impact whatsoever.
[1392.24 --> 1394.86]  But that'd be an interesting metric to see how it actually plays out.
[1394.94 --> 1397.04]  I don't think NVIDIA gives two craps what any of us think.
[1397.34 --> 1397.88]  I think you're right.
[1397.96 --> 1398.80]  To be perfectly honest.
[1399.66 --> 1402.64]  It's really funny because I think you take this somewhat too.
[1402.78 --> 1406.18]  But we take flack all the time for being in NVIDIA's pocket or whatever else.
[1406.18 --> 1406.48]  Oh, somewhat?
[1406.82 --> 1407.46]  I think somewhat?
[1407.60 --> 1407.82]  Yeah.
[1407.92 --> 1408.34]  Yeah, no.
[1408.70 --> 1410.30]  I don't know if you get it as bad as we do.
[1410.50 --> 1412.18]  Wensho is brought to you by NVIDIA.
[1412.96 --> 1413.68]  Yeah, well.
[1413.78 --> 1414.66]  According to the audience, anyway.
[1414.66 --> 1421.78]  So, like, it's one of those things where, like, you know, I've butted heads with them a fair number of times.
[1422.48 --> 1422.84]  Recently.
[1423.56 --> 1427.88]  More often than I, like, go to a nice dinner and, you know, talk shop.
[1429.10 --> 1432.82]  It's been pretty tough lately, actually.
[1433.96 --> 1434.44]  All right.
[1434.70 --> 1436.48]  So let's have a look at...
[1436.48 --> 1437.68]  We didn't get Titan XP.
[1438.64 --> 1439.12]  Neither did I.
[1439.42 --> 1440.30]  Until, like, now?
[1440.54 --> 1441.44]  Yeah, we have one now.
[1441.58 --> 1441.82]  Yeah.
[1442.02 --> 1443.58]  Because they were like, oh, what, you guys don't have one?
[1444.06 --> 1444.70]  I was like, no?
[1444.88 --> 1446.54]  I asked for one for Terry Crews and they said no.
[1447.22 --> 1447.54]  Seriously?
[1447.54 --> 1447.78]  What?
[1448.04 --> 1453.18]  They turned me down until I made that video, like, talking crap about Titan XP, which would have gone out regardless.
[1453.38 --> 1457.36]  Because I think it's a really stupid card based on, like, the way they're locking down the Kuda cores.
[1457.56 --> 1459.78]  And they're unlocking it multiple times in the same generation.
[1460.58 --> 1463.94]  But it was after that that they were like, two of them just showed up.
[1464.62 --> 1464.98]  Right.
[1465.14 --> 1465.34]  Right?
[1465.46 --> 1466.82]  So they hand-delivered them.
[1468.04 --> 1468.36]  Yeah.
[1468.54 --> 1469.50]  I was like, they're not even for me.
[1469.56 --> 1470.22]  I don't even care.
[1470.46 --> 1470.68]  Right?
[1470.74 --> 1471.52]  They're not for me.
[1471.52 --> 1476.52]  And, like, this is a stupid thing on both the vendor side and the audience side.
[1477.12 --> 1481.98]  Do you guys honestly think that Jay can be bought with a graphics card?
[1482.14 --> 1483.14]  That doesn't pay my lease.
[1484.18 --> 1486.50]  That doesn't pay for my employee, my insurance.
[1486.84 --> 1489.24]  Do you need more graphics cards, Jay?
[1489.74 --> 1490.96]  It's pretty obvious I don't sell them.
[1491.16 --> 1492.76]  I mean, you can see the shop, you know.
[1493.26 --> 1495.36]  No, they do not run my business.
[1495.36 --> 1497.62]  In fact, I started buying more stuff than ever now.
[1498.26 --> 1498.66]  I've noticed that.
[1498.72 --> 1501.34]  You were talking about buying lots of stuff yourself.
[1502.82 --> 1503.82]  It's just easier.
[1504.70 --> 1505.58]  And it's not...
[1505.58 --> 1506.02]  You can get it right away.
[1506.16 --> 1506.72]  You don't have to...
[1506.72 --> 1506.86]  Yeah.
[1507.32 --> 1507.56]  Yep.
[1508.36 --> 1512.06]  And now with your Scrapyard War experience, you can buy more stuff, too.
[1512.52 --> 1514.40]  With someone else's money, which is great.
[1514.40 --> 1522.46]  Speaking of someone else's money, the show today is brought to you by Cable Mod.
[1522.88 --> 1523.28]  Yeah.
[1524.30 --> 1525.82]  We've got some stuff over there.
[1525.82 --> 1526.18]  Yeah.
[1526.38 --> 1526.82]  Okay.
[1527.58 --> 1534.02]  So Cable Mod now has sleeving for AIOs.
[1534.24 --> 1534.96]  Have you guys seen this?
[1535.06 --> 1535.80]  Have you heard about this?
[1535.88 --> 1535.98]  Yeah.
[1536.00 --> 1536.50]  Oh, okay.
[1536.50 --> 1538.26]  I did a great review that was very well received.
[1538.44 --> 1538.96]  Oh, okay.
[1539.18 --> 1539.88]  I didn't watch it.
[1540.12 --> 1540.54]  I know you didn't.
[1540.58 --> 1541.34]  I didn't watch it either.
[1541.34 --> 1548.46]  So basically, you buy your AIO, and then with no actual modification required, you guys
[1548.46 --> 1550.34]  can go watch Jay's video, because we didn't review them.
[1551.36 --> 1552.04]  I'm trying to finger traps.
[1552.26 --> 1552.86]  But there you go.
[1552.96 --> 1556.52]  You just kind of unfold it, and then you don't have to take off the tubing or anything like
[1556.52 --> 1556.66]  that.
[1556.70 --> 1562.40]  You just wrap it around, and you end up with that nice sleeved look on your AIO cooler tubes,
[1562.40 --> 1565.74]  and matches your cabling, assuming you went and bought Cable Mod cabling.
[1566.38 --> 1568.18]  And that's pretty much it.
[1568.22 --> 1569.90]  They've got little finishing pieces for the end.
[1569.90 --> 1571.46]  So they look nice and tidy.
[1572.34 --> 1574.16]  And what else can I really say about it?
[1574.18 --> 1575.46]  I mean, it's a pretty simple idea.
[1575.58 --> 1576.54]  It just took someone to do it.
[1576.68 --> 1579.12]  The colors do specifically match their cable sleeving.
[1579.68 --> 1580.84]  So they're perfectly matched for that.
[1581.02 --> 1582.88]  So they've got lots and lots of different colors.
[1582.96 --> 1584.16]  You guys can go check them out.
[1584.24 --> 1585.02]  Oh, that's cool.
[1585.14 --> 1588.24]  They also just launched their sleeving kits on Amazon.
[1588.64 --> 1591.08]  So we've got a link in the video description for that.
[1591.08 --> 1593.34]  But basically, it's a...
[1593.34 --> 1594.08]  Hold on a second.
[1594.80 --> 1596.88]  Can I even figure out how to do this on a Mac?
[1597.78 --> 1598.44]  Holy crap.
[1598.44 --> 1598.80]  What are you trying to do?
[1598.80 --> 1600.30]  You can't right click.
[1600.78 --> 1601.82]  It's two finger click.
[1601.88 --> 1602.10]  Copy.
[1602.22 --> 1603.00]  You have to like...
[1603.00 --> 1603.66]  Two finger tap.
[1603.76 --> 1604.64]  Two finger tap.
[1604.94 --> 1605.74]  That took me a while.
[1605.74 --> 1606.82]  Also, I'm not signed in.
[1606.94 --> 1607.68]  So forget it.
[1607.88 --> 1609.10]  The link will be below the video.
[1609.16 --> 1609.70]  I'll get it.
[1610.46 --> 1611.28]  All right.
[1611.52 --> 1613.06]  What else we got here?
[1613.18 --> 1614.36]  Oh, yes.
[1615.04 --> 1615.70]  Today's show is...
[1615.70 --> 1616.34]  Are you getting the challenge?
[1616.52 --> 1618.74]  ...also brought to you by...
[1620.18 --> 1621.06]  G Fuel.
[1621.50 --> 1622.08]  That's right.
[1622.18 --> 1624.74]  The same G Fuel that we were...
[1624.74 --> 1626.66]  Check it out.
[1627.38 --> 1630.82]  That right there is concentrated blue energy.
[1630.82 --> 1639.42]  G Fuel powers the editing of many of our videos and the writing of most episodes of Fast as possible around here.
[1639.58 --> 1645.12]  We actually consume as an office an inordinate amount of G Fuel.
[1646.04 --> 1651.16]  So basically how it works is you choose your fuel, select your drink mix from over...
[1651.16 --> 1651.88]  Excuse me.
[1651.96 --> 1652.92]  From 18 flavors.
[1653.30 --> 1654.62]  They ship it directly to you.
[1654.78 --> 1655.78]  You just add water.
[1655.88 --> 1659.56]  So you mix one serving into a glass or shaker cup filled with 16 ounces of water.
[1659.56 --> 1660.96]  And enjoy.
[1661.10 --> 1661.92]  It comes in tubs.
[1663.32 --> 1664.20]  Just like that.
[1664.52 --> 1665.68]  Boxes containing packs.
[1665.90 --> 1668.62]  Or just the little packs themselves.
[1669.26 --> 1669.70]  And then...
[1669.70 --> 1671.12]  Who put this note in here?
[1671.32 --> 1674.22]  A bunch of the people here at the office pretty much live off of it.
[1674.98 --> 1675.92]  So what, John?
[1676.38 --> 1677.16]  John for sure.
[1677.24 --> 1678.66]  I know Colton drinks a lot as well.
[1678.66 --> 1679.64]  Colton drinks a lot of it.
[1679.68 --> 1681.98]  I've seen a bunch in the editing den, but I'm not entirely sure who...
[1681.98 --> 1682.88]  Yeah, who drinks it in there though?
[1682.88 --> 1683.38]  I'm not sure.
[1683.70 --> 1684.60]  I think Ed does.
[1684.76 --> 1685.92]  I wouldn't be surprised at all if he does.
[1685.92 --> 1688.52]  I'm pretty sure Ed consumes copious amounts of it.
[1689.56 --> 1691.26]  So there you have it.
[1691.32 --> 1694.52]  Their goal was to create an alternative to sugar loaded canned energy drinks.
[1694.94 --> 1696.72]  And now you can have these packets.
[1696.84 --> 1697.64]  You mix them with water.
[1697.88 --> 1699.38]  And bippity bop, you're ready to go.
[1699.60 --> 1706.78]  So you can save 40% until August 21st using offer code Linus at the link that I am definitely
[1706.78 --> 1710.56]  going to put right here, right now over at gfuel.com.
[1710.56 --> 1713.86]  All right, our last sponsor.
[1714.94 --> 1716.68]  Go team Salad!
[1718.00 --> 1719.46]  Have you guys tried Savage Turkey?
[1719.60 --> 1720.58]  Go team Salad.
[1720.68 --> 1721.50]  Do you guys want to try it?
[1721.50 --> 1722.12]  You don't have to.
[1722.20 --> 1723.48]  This is like my sponsor spot.
[1723.66 --> 1724.08]  It's the spicy.
[1724.32 --> 1725.14]  They're spicy.
[1725.46 --> 1726.94]  Can I get more water first?
[1727.20 --> 1727.88]  Ed, are you watching?
[1727.88 --> 1730.02]  Yeah, you can get some more water.
[1730.06 --> 1731.64]  I will personally go get you water.
[1732.84 --> 1733.26]  Okay.
[1733.26 --> 1733.92]  He's going to go.
[1734.12 --> 1735.18]  No, I want Linus to do it now.
[1735.22 --> 1735.70]  He said he would.
[1735.76 --> 1736.34]  No, I'll do it.
[1736.34 --> 1736.66]  I'll do it.
[1737.06 --> 1737.38]  Okay.
[1737.58 --> 1739.84]  I got Linus to get up and leave his own show to get me water.
[1739.96 --> 1740.64]  That's a win.
[1740.74 --> 1741.56]  So we got the Reaper.
[1742.32 --> 1743.52]  We got the Mojo.
[1743.52 --> 1744.44]  Okay, so if you're...
[1744.44 --> 1746.46]  I've been informed this is Mojo, not Mojo.
[1746.66 --> 1746.98]  Mojo.
[1747.14 --> 1747.32]  Mojo.
[1747.32 --> 1753.30]  If you're like into spicy but not an insane amount of spicy, like you don't want your face to
[1753.30 --> 1755.74]  literally melt but you're into spicy, I like Mojo.
[1755.74 --> 1758.84]  I think people have been eating these because they're like all almost empty.
[1759.16 --> 1759.30]  Yeah.
[1759.86 --> 1762.46]  Everyone's just like, oh yeah, I'll just like eat one.
[1762.46 --> 1762.82]  Ghost pepper?
[1762.82 --> 1763.24]  No one will know this.
[1763.24 --> 1763.66]  That's really hot one.
[1763.98 --> 1766.72]  That's pretty hot and Reaper I think is even hotter.
[1766.82 --> 1768.50]  Yeah, Reaper is the crazy one.
[1768.84 --> 1770.32]  Ghost pepper is like pretty damn hot.
[1770.64 --> 1771.28]  Mojo is on the...
[1771.28 --> 1771.96]  This is less hot.
[1771.96 --> 1772.64]  Sorry, I can be good to.
[1772.72 --> 1774.10]  This is like a three.
[1774.50 --> 1776.76]  So it's like spicy and it'll kick.
[1777.38 --> 1778.66]  So the Reaper is a five.
[1778.80 --> 1780.06]  It like makes its own level.
[1780.74 --> 1782.02]  Ghost pepper is a four.
[1782.34 --> 1783.88]  Okay, this one's just delicious.
[1783.88 --> 1787.26]  If you guys just want something tasty before you melt your taste buds off.
[1787.54 --> 1787.86]  What is this?
[1787.94 --> 1788.20]  Mojo.
[1788.46 --> 1789.56]  This is only a one.
[1790.16 --> 1791.06]  So if you want to try a piece.
[1791.62 --> 1792.56]  So Savage Jerky.
[1792.82 --> 1795.72]  They're jerky's made with the best ingredients without nitrates or preservatives.
[1795.86 --> 1798.26]  The goal was to create a snack that was full of flavor and spice.
[1798.38 --> 1799.20]  That's not bad for you.
[1799.58 --> 1801.12]  They've got 13 different flavors.
[1801.42 --> 1805.98]  My personal favorites are Mojo as well as the Maple Buffalo Bacon.
[1805.98 --> 1811.16]  And some of the taste bud melty ones are actually pretty darn good.
[1811.24 --> 1817.32]  They've got jerky's made of ghost pepper as well as Carolina Reapers.
[1817.70 --> 1824.04]  And you can use offer code LTT to save 10% over at savagejerky.com.
[1824.04 --> 1826.28]  All right, I will go get you some water.
[1826.36 --> 1826.70]  Thank you, sir.
[1826.86 --> 1829.28]  And you go ahead and pick one of those if you want.
[1829.34 --> 1831.06]  I'm not going to make you do it, though, because they're...
[1831.06 --> 1832.08]  Like my girlfriend would die.
[1832.16 --> 1833.24]  Savage is right in the name.
[1833.30 --> 1833.58]  Oh, really?
[1833.68 --> 1834.34]  This is too spicy?
[1834.50 --> 1837.26]  Okay, you've got a giant piece in there.
[1837.32 --> 1837.92]  I think you'll be good.
[1838.00 --> 1838.58]  I love habanero.
[1839.02 --> 1839.92]  Yeah, I think you'll be good.
[1840.34 --> 1840.50]  Yeah.
[1840.90 --> 1841.42]  Will I be good?
[1841.42 --> 1843.92]  If you don't like spice, don't eat that one.
[1844.06 --> 1845.46]  But if you like spice, it's good.
[1845.62 --> 1846.60]  The Mojo one's not hot.
[1847.12 --> 1847.32]  No.
[1847.82 --> 1848.72]  The Mojo one's a one.
[1848.90 --> 1850.58]  It's like it's not even supposed to be hot.
[1850.58 --> 1855.24]  Good?
[1855.38 --> 1855.52]  Yeah.
[1855.80 --> 1855.94]  Yeah.
[1856.04 --> 1856.90]  Give me two minutes.
[1857.00 --> 1857.50]  I'll be sweating.
[1859.66 --> 1861.92]  Yeah, the Reaper's a bit of a kick.
[1862.10 --> 1863.02]  That one kind of sucks.
[1863.22 --> 1863.86]  That's a five.
[1864.00 --> 1866.32]  Sucks in terms of like it hurts.
[1866.48 --> 1867.86]  It tastes good, to be fair.
[1868.62 --> 1870.00]  Don't they don't like it?
[1870.00 --> 1871.92]  It's like the powder.
[1872.12 --> 1873.18]  Like sometimes you breathe the powder.
[1873.58 --> 1873.70]  Yeah.
[1873.98 --> 1875.32]  But no, flavor's really good.
[1875.40 --> 1876.14]  Because they try to...
[1876.14 --> 1879.58]  They go pretty hard with the flavor stuff, which I like for beef jerky.
[1879.58 --> 1881.68]  I think that's one of the reasons why I like Mojo so much.
[1882.06 --> 1882.90]  I'm cool with hot.
[1884.74 --> 1885.06]  Yeah.
[1885.54 --> 1887.20]  No, it's not too hot, I swear.
[1888.08 --> 1889.42]  I'm cool with hot if it has flavor.
[1889.90 --> 1891.42]  But hot for the sake of hot, there's no point.
[1891.42 --> 1892.24]  No, I'm the same way.
[1892.34 --> 1892.48]  Yeah.
[1892.72 --> 1895.10]  I can deal with a fair amount of spice, but I only do it because I like the taste.
[1895.10 --> 1897.14]  And it's not even like water helps with habanero.
[1897.30 --> 1897.80]  I'm just thirsty.
[1897.96 --> 1898.12]  Yeah.
[1898.74 --> 1899.12]  All right.
[1899.20 --> 1900.78]  I'm going to drop a bomb on you guys.
[1900.96 --> 1904.14]  This was originally posted by Numlock21 on the forum.
[1904.28 --> 1906.76]  The original article here is from videocards.com.
[1906.84 --> 1907.98]  So I take it with a grain of salt.
[1907.98 --> 1918.96]  So, Intel claims the Core i7 8700K will be 11% faster than the 7700K.
[1919.60 --> 1921.64]  And here's what I want to know.
[1922.22 --> 1924.04]  Because this is crazy.
[1924.04 --> 1928.82]  Well, it is, to be fair, a whole entire 1% higher than I would have guessed.
[1929.04 --> 1930.30]  This is what I want to know.
[1930.30 --> 1935.50]  Who needed Intel to claim this to know that this was coming?
[1935.60 --> 1935.84]  Yeah.
[1936.86 --> 1943.64]  I mean, this is literally what we've been complaining about.
[1943.84 --> 1945.04]  Does this mean that they're not scared?
[1946.44 --> 1946.84]  Okay.
[1946.96 --> 1947.60]  So here's the thing.
[1947.72 --> 1948.38]  So there's two things.
[1948.46 --> 1953.68]  First of all, the rumors are also that Coffee Lake is going to be available in six core configurations.
[1953.68 --> 1955.52]  Which would legit be good.
[1955.84 --> 1956.12]  Okay.
[1956.54 --> 1957.76]  So if they're 10...
[1957.76 --> 1959.24]  So they're keeping their 10% and adding cores.
[1959.44 --> 1968.68]  If they're 10% faster in terms of IPC and they're adding 50% more cores, then I'm looking at this going...
[1970.04 --> 1970.96]  That's a good jump.
[1971.08 --> 1975.78]  Thank you for what should have happened two years ago, but okay.
[1976.12 --> 1976.38]  Yeah.
[1977.24 --> 1977.58]  Fine.
[1978.36 --> 1978.98]  Thank you.
[1979.42 --> 1987.96]  I mean, I still appreciate them doing something good, even if it was a long time coming and should have happened before.
[1988.16 --> 1990.20]  So the 8700K is rumored to be the six core.
[1990.48 --> 1990.84]  Excuse me.
[1990.84 --> 1996.84]  It's supposed to be six core, 12 thread, with a single threaded boost over the 7700K of about 11%.
[1997.48 --> 2000.16]  Yet there'll still be an i5 on X299 at that time.
[2002.68 --> 2004.60]  Because X299s aren't going to be refreshed by then.
[2004.60 --> 2005.90]  So, yeah.
[2006.04 --> 2008.26]  I mean, this is yet another reason.
[2008.40 --> 2009.42]  I mean, you know...
[2009.42 --> 2009.68]  Okay.
[2010.04 --> 2011.08]  You know my feelings.
[2011.36 --> 2015.44]  I know your feelings on the 7740 and the 7640.
[2015.78 --> 2019.02]  Those two SKUs make no sense at all.
[2019.12 --> 2019.24]  Yep.
[2019.46 --> 2022.58]  And when Coffee Lake launches, those SKUs...
[2022.58 --> 2028.62]  Remember, the whole point of the high-end desktop platform is supposed to be mucho memory bandwidth,
[2029.40 --> 2033.16]  mucho PCIe lanes, and mucho processing cores.
[2033.16 --> 2034.30]  And moho jerky.
[2034.60 --> 2037.92]  Those chips have none of those things.
[2038.52 --> 2043.16]  They have beefed up power delivery, so theoretically you can overclock them a little higher.
[2043.24 --> 2044.02]  They're still dual core.
[2044.14 --> 2048.42]  They still have the mainstream platform number of PCIe lanes, and they're still quad core processors.
[2048.42 --> 2051.14]  And they're pulling significantly more power than their mainstream counterparts.
[2051.14 --> 2055.92]  And now, compared to the mainstream platform that's coming...
[2055.92 --> 2056.58]  Oh, I don't know.
[2056.66 --> 2056.80]  What?
[2057.72 --> 2059.24]  It's rumored to be launching what?
[2059.70 --> 2067.46]  So it would be three months later, if the rumors are true, it will be two generations behind architecturally.
[2067.82 --> 2068.32]  Two!
[2068.32 --> 2068.74]  Yeah.
[2068.74 --> 2074.72]  And that might only be 10% per generation, or 8% or whatever.
[2074.72 --> 2078.32]  But still, two generations times 10% is not complicated, Matt.
[2078.38 --> 2079.18]  That's 20%.
[2079.18 --> 2079.50]  Yeah.
[2079.50 --> 2082.82]  So if you had a 5 gigahertz processor, let's say you're an overclocker...
[2082.82 --> 2083.82]  It's actually better than that.
[2083.82 --> 2085.90]  It's 10% on top of 10%.
[2085.90 --> 2086.44]  That's right.
[2086.78 --> 2088.64]  So let's say you're an overclocker.
[2088.90 --> 2090.18]  You get to 5 gigahertz.
[2090.68 --> 2098.54]  We're talking about now, on this high-end platform, you would be equivalent to the mainstream's performance at what?
[2098.60 --> 2099.48]  Like 4 gigahertz?
[2099.66 --> 2099.90]  Right.
[2099.90 --> 2104.04]  Well, that's not good!
[2105.80 --> 2108.90]  Why did I just go spend $350 on a motherboard?
[2109.12 --> 2109.36]  Intel?
[2110.10 --> 2114.70]  Because they're hoping you're going to just step forward, or future compatibility with more expensive bigger.
[2115.04 --> 2119.02]  But why would you still spend, you know, almost $400 on that CPU if you're getting the i7?
[2119.02 --> 2119.56]  That's the thing.
[2119.70 --> 2123.26]  It's like, I get that argument if it's like a Pentium dual core or something.
[2123.38 --> 2125.50]  And that's devil's advocate argument as far as I'm concerned.
[2125.60 --> 2125.72]  Right?
[2126.38 --> 2128.94]  Like, I've seen that before.
[2128.94 --> 2131.42]  Like Pentium Anniversary Edition, where we're talking $100 chip.
[2131.56 --> 2131.74]  Right.
[2131.98 --> 2134.78]  You buy something to get running today.
[2135.00 --> 2136.98]  You hope it doesn't drop in value too much.
[2137.06 --> 2137.26]  You flip.
[2137.32 --> 2141.08]  Because a $100 CPU, if it drops in value 20%, we're talking $20.
[2141.48 --> 2141.74]  Yeah.
[2142.34 --> 2142.58]  Right?
[2142.80 --> 2149.08]  And if you've managed to save up your $400 or $500 or whatever you need for an 8-core processor by that point,
[2149.66 --> 2152.14]  then surely the $20 is not that big of a deal.
[2152.24 --> 2153.12]  Some time has passed.
[2153.48 --> 2154.46]  I get that logic.
[2154.46 --> 2159.56]  But here we're talking about a $300 plus processor that you're buying as a placeholder.
[2160.10 --> 2160.82]  Doesn't make sense.
[2160.88 --> 2163.80]  Do you guys buy a $300 processor as a placeholder in the socket?
[2164.68 --> 2167.34]  I don't really buy processors as placeholders.
[2168.22 --> 2168.74]  Right.
[2169.16 --> 2171.56]  And we never recommend that.
[2171.66 --> 2171.88]  No.
[2172.54 --> 2174.02]  Do you guys ever recommend that?
[2174.36 --> 2174.52]  No.
[2174.52 --> 2176.92]  Buy hardware that isn't what you actually need?
[2176.92 --> 2179.62]  And then buy something else later?
[2180.12 --> 2180.24]  Yeah.
[2180.38 --> 2180.42]  No.
[2180.56 --> 2184.58]  Unless you're a crazy Craigslist or use site junkie.
[2185.38 --> 2188.20]  Because you've done this kind of stuff, but you're constantly flipping things.
[2188.30 --> 2191.92]  So you were never planning on holding it for more than possibly even two weeks.
[2192.12 --> 2194.30]  But even then, you're usually not buying new anyway.
[2194.44 --> 2194.74]  That's right.
[2194.84 --> 2194.86]  No.
[2195.02 --> 2195.42]  Yeah.
[2195.62 --> 2195.90]  Exactly.
[2196.24 --> 2197.40]  So it's not even applicable.
[2197.40 --> 2208.30]  So I could see buying a 7740 from some idiot who bought it, realized that this was really stupid, and then is like, oh crap, this thing isn't worth much.
[2208.42 --> 2209.98]  I guess I'll just take a bath on it.
[2210.36 --> 2211.78]  I could buy from that guy.
[2211.92 --> 2212.10]  Yeah.
[2212.36 --> 2219.68]  And then I do buy myself a few months to save up, and I can probably flip it for pretty close to what I paid, but I wouldn't buy something like that new.
[2220.00 --> 2220.22]  No.
[2220.22 --> 2225.34]  That's why I threw mine in an HTPC, just because I was like, what else am I going to do with this?
[2225.40 --> 2229.86]  Oh, I'll take the chip that doesn't make sense and put it in a form factor that doesn't make sense for an X299 platform to begin with.
[2230.00 --> 2231.32]  So that my whole video was based on that.
[2233.22 --> 2235.94]  I just figured we'd put nonsense on top of nonsense.
[2236.80 --> 2238.68]  And then I called it my VR rig on top of that.
[2238.82 --> 2239.30]  There you go.
[2239.66 --> 2240.36]  Oh my gosh.
[2240.36 --> 2241.88]  It's got a VR capable sticker.
[2242.12 --> 2242.54]  Put it on.
[2243.46 --> 2248.00]  We've got to get, as reviewers, we need to get our own VR capable stickers and just start putting them on every single...
[2248.00 --> 2249.50]  It's a watermark on the video channel.
[2249.50 --> 2250.38]  Oh, perfect.
[2250.48 --> 2250.88]  VR ready.
[2250.98 --> 2252.18]  This video is VR ready.
[2252.24 --> 2252.54]  Yes.
[2252.84 --> 2253.50]  But it's really not.
[2253.64 --> 2255.46]  Well, you could technically if you put it in theater mode.
[2255.54 --> 2255.92]  Oh, true.
[2256.06 --> 2257.16]  Yeah, just watch it in VR theater.
[2257.34 --> 2257.64]  Yes.
[2258.24 --> 2258.80]  Figured out.
[2259.12 --> 2259.68]  VR ready.
[2260.28 --> 2261.10]  This is VR ready.
[2262.30 --> 2263.42]  Life is VR ready.
[2263.62 --> 2263.88]  Oh.
[2264.70 --> 2265.06]  Right?
[2265.34 --> 2270.64]  Yeah, because you could buy an Oculus or anything else in life, which means that it's VR ready.
[2270.64 --> 2273.28]  I was going with Sony VR or whatever it is.
[2273.40 --> 2273.86]  Oh, yeah.
[2274.16 --> 2274.84]  Also that.
[2276.92 --> 2277.36]  What?
[2278.42 --> 2278.86]  Yeah.
[2278.86 --> 2278.94]  Yeah.
[2279.38 --> 2279.78]  Okay.
[2280.14 --> 2282.70]  So the original article here is from Ars Technica.
[2282.88 --> 2286.34]  I've been completely out of the loop this week.
[2286.88 --> 2287.24]  So I had no idea.
[2287.24 --> 2288.06]  Well, this isn't that crazy.
[2288.78 --> 2290.44]  I can kind of explain why.
[2290.66 --> 2293.86]  So Apple is investing a huge amount.
[2294.86 --> 2297.58]  It says they're going all in, but Apple has a lot of money.
[2297.66 --> 2299.70]  Yeah, billion dollars is not all in with Apple.
[2299.84 --> 2300.50]  So not at all.
[2300.58 --> 2300.94]  Just saying.
[2300.94 --> 2304.42]  Um, but they're, they're putting a billion dollar budget to Apple shows.
[2304.42 --> 2310.24]  Uh, so they're doing like the, the first original series from them was Planet of the Apps and Carpool Karaoke.
[2310.40 --> 2312.40]  And they're doing more, but this isn't that surprising.
[2313.00 --> 2315.42]  Netflix is going really hardcore into original content.
[2315.42 --> 2319.70]  They're going to be putting these shows on the Apple music thing.
[2319.70 --> 2321.54]  So they probably need to rename that.
[2321.76 --> 2332.84]  But oh, well, um, a lot of these big companies that are trying to serve video are going into original content because licensing, especially from like big movies and big shows.
[2332.84 --> 2337.52]  If you want to have all of them is obscenely prohibitively expensive.
[2337.52 --> 2339.36]  And this is something you and I have discussed.
[2339.58 --> 2346.48]  Um, apparently there isn't a video streaming platform online, like a significant one.
[2346.58 --> 2348.42]  I mean, that's losing money.
[2348.74 --> 2348.82]  Yeah.
[2349.72 --> 2352.92]  And you know, now that we are really digging into.
[2353.18 --> 2356.88]  Well, sometimes they're parts of bigger companies and then they don't care that they're not losing money.
[2357.14 --> 2359.06]  Or it's offset by some other aspect of the business.
[2359.24 --> 2359.60]  Exactly.
[2359.70 --> 2359.88]  Yeah.
[2359.88 --> 2373.30]  But the actual video streaming division, whether we're talking YouTube, um, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, Twitch, as far as we can tell, they're all losing money.
[2373.54 --> 2377.96]  And like hearing from certain people that work at some of those companies, not all of them, but some of those companies.
[2377.96 --> 2381.98]  We know people that, I think we know at least someone at pretty much all of them.
[2382.18 --> 2382.32]  Yeah.
[2383.44 --> 2388.98]  Which makes moves like Disney pulling all of their movies off of Netflix to have their own streaming service just really make you scratch your head.
[2388.98 --> 2393.04]  I mean, I know Disney has Disney money to spend, but still no company wants to bleed money.
[2393.20 --> 2397.30]  But they already have a website and they've already been streaming their own video, to be fair.
[2397.44 --> 2398.54]  So they just have to scale up.
[2398.56 --> 2401.06]  Yeah, but you could get their stuff in other places now.
[2401.32 --> 2403.56]  Their video is going to be available only on one source.
[2403.76 --> 2405.58]  So they're going to have to probably upscale anyway.
[2405.80 --> 2407.62]  And that way they can control the pricing too.
[2407.74 --> 2408.62]  They can decide.
[2408.62 --> 2410.58]  And they can control the content that goes around it.
[2410.72 --> 2411.78]  Disney cares about that a lot.
[2411.94 --> 2412.48]  Yeah, they do.
[2412.48 --> 2418.34]  And also users are already getting familiar with needing to get their hands into so many other platforms.
[2418.54 --> 2418.64]  Yeah.
[2418.88 --> 2421.98]  And you know how we were talking about there's going to be sites that pop up that bring everything together?
[2422.14 --> 2422.76]  They already exist.
[2423.30 --> 2423.90]  All right.
[2423.98 --> 2424.40]  Well, there you go.
[2424.40 --> 2424.80]  They're already a thing.
[2425.24 --> 2425.36]  Yeah.
[2425.92 --> 2429.12]  So you just kind of like log in with all your logins there and then it just becomes a single hub.
[2429.14 --> 2430.44]  It becomes one viewing site.
[2431.46 --> 2431.86]  Yeah.
[2432.18 --> 2434.52]  So like I got tons of tweets about that last time.
[2434.58 --> 2434.72]  Yeah.
[2434.72 --> 2435.84]  I think they're actually, you know what?
[2435.88 --> 2440.84]  I feel really stupid now because I know Samsung had a thing built into their smart TVs like a while back.
[2440.84 --> 2441.84]  That mixes it all together.
[2441.98 --> 2443.12]  For years that actually just.
[2443.12 --> 2444.66]  It's just a browser of the other browsers.
[2444.80 --> 2445.00]  Yeah.
[2445.08 --> 2449.02]  It just goes and finds and it can even browse rental services like Google Play.
[2449.10 --> 2449.56]  Oh, that's neat.
[2449.90 --> 2453.74]  You know what's really funny is on the subject of Apple doing their own original programming
[2453.74 --> 2457.22]  and like they should probably change the name of like iTunes now.
[2457.22 --> 2464.90]  I gave Google so much crap about Google Play Store back when they did it.
[2465.34 --> 2468.16]  Now it totally makes sense.
[2468.34 --> 2468.36]  Yeah.
[2468.54 --> 2468.62]  Yeah.
[2468.82 --> 2472.04]  Play music, play games, play videos.
[2472.38 --> 2475.30]  Oh, they actually got that one right.
[2475.48 --> 2475.70]  Yeah.
[2475.98 --> 2476.94]  Way to go, Google.
[2477.86 --> 2478.00]  Sometimes.
[2478.00 --> 2480.90]  They just did it way ahead of time when in the moment it didn't make a ton of sense.
[2480.90 --> 2481.02]  Yeah.
[2481.02 --> 2482.42]  It just made a lot more sense in the future.
[2482.62 --> 2485.02]  They were playing 3D chess.
[2485.28 --> 2486.02]  They were doing the long game.
[2486.02 --> 2487.76]  And I was playing with my penis.
[2488.24 --> 2488.56]  Wow.
[2489.78 --> 2491.56]  That was what was going on there.
[2491.82 --> 2492.74]  I didn't get it.
[2492.80 --> 2495.80]  I mean, you were making children at that point in time.
[2496.02 --> 2496.64]  No, not yet.
[2496.90 --> 2497.30]  Oh, okay.
[2497.70 --> 2497.92]  Yeah.
[2498.02 --> 2498.54]  No, not yet.
[2498.64 --> 2500.22]  No, that was a solo effort.
[2500.42 --> 2501.86]  Oh, that's why it was just playing.
[2501.94 --> 2502.52]  Solo effort.
[2502.68 --> 2503.00]  I see.
[2503.18 --> 2503.34]  Yeah.
[2503.46 --> 2503.78]  Okay.
[2504.58 --> 2504.80]  Yeah.
[2505.06 --> 2505.26]  Yeah.
[2505.44 --> 2505.58]  Yeah.
[2506.36 --> 2507.28]  Still a fun game.
[2508.00 --> 2510.02]  I'm surprised I would have one billion here.
[2510.02 --> 2510.66]  It's great.
[2513.84 --> 2515.94]  I put up the green screen picture from earlier.
[2516.02 --> 2516.70]  When someone did that.
[2516.80 --> 2517.62]  Oh, no.
[2519.00 --> 2520.26]  I love how you said that.
[2521.44 --> 2522.44]  Oh, no.
[2522.72 --> 2523.74]  Show him the other one.
[2524.64 --> 2526.18]  These guys can't see.
[2526.18 --> 2527.24]  I'll show you that.
[2527.24 --> 2528.74]  You guys are going to need to check out at Jay's Two Cents.
[2529.08 --> 2529.50]  Actually, here.
[2529.60 --> 2530.50]  I can pull it up.
[2530.92 --> 2531.14]  Yeah.
[2531.34 --> 2531.88]  It's pretty.
[2532.06 --> 2532.56]  It's pretty.
[2533.26 --> 2533.66]  So we.
[2534.34 --> 2537.42]  Dimitri and I earlier, if you guys follow our social media, we stood in front of their green screen.
[2537.90 --> 2538.74]  And it was.
[2538.96 --> 2542.08]  To give you guys an opportunity to key out and play around with green screen pictures.
[2542.22 --> 2542.84]  There's some good options.
[2542.84 --> 2544.88]  There's some really good creative people out there.
[2544.96 --> 2545.52]  My goodness.
[2546.24 --> 2547.12]  Just go to media.
[2547.50 --> 2547.96]  Oh, there it is.
[2548.04 --> 2548.16]  Yeah.
[2548.76 --> 2550.38]  Also, make sure to tag.
[2550.68 --> 2551.88]  Some of them might not be appropriate.
[2552.02 --> 2553.18]  So you might not want to scroll live.
[2553.18 --> 2555.52]  Okay, there it is.
[2555.54 --> 2557.14]  Well, there's the one we were looking for.
[2560.04 --> 2561.58]  Who's that you're thinking up there, Jay?
[2561.64 --> 2562.40]  Would your wife approve?
[2562.44 --> 2563.04]  Who is that?
[2563.26 --> 2567.08]  Who is that foxy, uh, foxy individual?
[2567.08 --> 2567.42]  Foxy, babe.
[2568.74 --> 2569.82]  Oh, what is going on here?
[2570.40 --> 2571.08]  Dang it, Apple.
[2572.90 --> 2573.34]  What is that?
[2573.34 --> 2573.72]  A spider?
[2574.76 --> 2575.38]  That's a sun.
[2575.44 --> 2575.92]  That's a sun.
[2576.04 --> 2576.26]  Okay.
[2578.02 --> 2578.88]  Oh, man.
[2580.30 --> 2581.04]  That's great.
[2581.64 --> 2582.18]  Oh, my God.
[2582.18 --> 2583.46]  That's...
[2583.46 --> 2584.58]  That is great.
[2588.00 --> 2588.90]  All right.
[2589.26 --> 2589.50]  See?
[2590.04 --> 2591.00]  We know how to have fun.
[2591.24 --> 2591.94]  We can have fun.
[2592.56 --> 2593.14]  Something that will work.
[2593.32 --> 2593.76]  All right.
[2593.88 --> 2596.32]  So here's some potentially big news.
[2596.48 --> 2599.02]  So PCGamer.com reports,
[2599.22 --> 2601.80]  and I'm just going to close this ad before I screen share with you guys,
[2602.38 --> 2608.02]  NVIDIA's next-gen Volta gaming GPUs not arriving anytime soon.
[2608.02 --> 2608.60]  Well, why would they?
[2608.72 --> 2612.06]  So this picture right here is Jensen showing off Volta,
[2612.64 --> 2616.68]  already super-duper definitely working in the data center,
[2616.82 --> 2621.00]  which means, based on the way that NVIDIA rolls out product,
[2621.54 --> 2623.88]  they launch their big GPU first,
[2624.74 --> 2626.54]  and whatever product that is,
[2626.68 --> 2627.94]  it used to be GeForce,
[2628.36 --> 2630.82]  now it never is, but I'm not bitter.
[2631.36 --> 2632.82]  NVIDIA launches their big one first,
[2632.90 --> 2635.62]  which means they've got the architecture down,
[2635.86 --> 2637.48]  and then they just cut.
[2637.96 --> 2639.26]  They cut and cut and cut,
[2639.34 --> 2642.16]  and the performance goes down according to how much they cut away.
[2642.16 --> 2646.94]  That process usually takes like two to three months per cut,
[2647.02 --> 2648.10]  because there is an R&D.
[2648.10 --> 2651.72]  It's obviously more complicated than just like taking a pair of scissors to a,
[2651.72 --> 2656.74]  you know, to a V100 and like taping that to a PCB.
[2656.74 --> 2659.56]  Like, so there's R&D that is involved with that,
[2659.60 --> 2661.24]  and you've only got so many engineers at a time.
[2661.30 --> 2662.52]  It's a resource management thing.
[2663.30 --> 2665.82]  So based on when they showed off,
[2666.18 --> 2669.66]  working, like production Volta silicon,
[2670.48 --> 2675.16]  they could probably be launching a GeForce card now if they felt like it.
[2675.16 --> 2675.90]  But there's no reason to.
[2675.98 --> 2678.68]  There's no competition for them to do it.
[2678.76 --> 2681.50]  And they pushed back their HBM already,
[2681.66 --> 2685.18]  generations from when the original roadmap back in like 2012 was leaked.
[2685.42 --> 2685.48]  Yeah.
[2685.48 --> 2686.64]  It was Maxwell, I believe,
[2686.74 --> 2688.62]  was when we were supposed to first see HBM.
[2688.80 --> 2689.56]  But we super did.
[2689.58 --> 2690.92]  But they now look at Vega,
[2690.92 --> 2693.90]  again, there's just like why even invest in the manufacturing cost of this
[2693.90 --> 2694.80]  when we don't have to,
[2694.90 --> 2698.12]  when our traditional architecture is still topping the competition.
[2698.84 --> 2701.18]  And the other thing too is like NVIDIA strategically,
[2701.34 --> 2702.84]  you've seen it over the last five years,
[2702.84 --> 2705.92]  has moved from try to make the GPU faster, faster, faster,
[2706.10 --> 2709.88]  to try to build out technology around the GPU.
[2710.12 --> 2713.08]  Whether it's stuff that doesn't make a ton of sense to me personally,
[2713.24 --> 2715.84]  like Ansel is that screenshotting thing
[2715.84 --> 2718.70]  where you can capture like super high resolution stills.
[2718.70 --> 2720.04]  Do you guys know anyone that uses that?
[2720.04 --> 2720.94]  Have you used it?
[2721.20 --> 2722.94]  I've used it only in the demo version
[2722.94 --> 2725.90]  just to see how high resolution you can go
[2725.90 --> 2727.34]  if you go like crank up the settings.
[2727.50 --> 2730.88]  But outside of seeing how beautifully you can turn those screenshots
[2730.88 --> 2732.70]  for like Witcher 3 and other games,
[2733.86 --> 2734.02]  there's never...
[2734.02 --> 2734.64]  I've never touched it.
[2734.64 --> 2736.52]  If you want like a big poster on your wall...
[2736.52 --> 2737.68]  I have never used it, ever.
[2737.78 --> 2738.88]  Like I'll tell you guys this.
[2738.92 --> 2741.40]  I remember this was a weird experience for me at a LAN party.
[2741.50 --> 2743.32]  This was back when like I went to LAN party,
[2743.32 --> 2745.04]  so clearly I like played video games.
[2745.52 --> 2747.22]  But I wasn't really...
[2747.22 --> 2751.30]  Like I didn't have like a guild or like a clan or anything like that.
[2751.38 --> 2754.52]  So being like really into video games was kind of alien to me.
[2754.98 --> 2757.12]  And there were these two people at a LAN.
[2757.34 --> 2759.88]  And it's only like a 45, 50 person LAN.
[2760.78 --> 2762.90]  Which like is big, but it's not that big.
[2763.18 --> 2765.18]  They spent like two hours...
[2765.18 --> 2770.86]  Literally, it felt like, you know, Uncle Harold's like vacation pictures.
[2771.34 --> 2775.72]  One of them was showing the other one an album of wow screenshots.
[2776.20 --> 2776.38]  Yeah.
[2776.52 --> 2780.22]  Like this was the time we climbed to the top of freaking some mountain
[2780.22 --> 2783.36]  and whoever clipped through the thing and like...
[2783.36 --> 2784.36]  Whoever clipped through the thing.
[2784.42 --> 2785.00]  So it was Hyjal?
[2785.64 --> 2785.92]  What?
[2786.02 --> 2786.98]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[2786.98 --> 2789.48]  So you know, this might have been pretty cool.
[2789.80 --> 2791.90]  Okay, one thing, wow screenshots was like a big deal
[2791.90 --> 2793.96]  because you'd show boss kills.
[2793.96 --> 2797.14]  And you'd usually have like the timestamp.
[2797.46 --> 2799.70]  So if you were like world first or server first or whatever,
[2799.82 --> 2800.84]  you could show the boss kill.
[2801.34 --> 2802.48]  It could be...
[2802.48 --> 2804.76]  And if he's talking about Mount Hyjal...
[2804.76 --> 2807.08]  And this is when you were at LAN parties.
[2807.34 --> 2808.84]  So this is probably classic wow, correct?
[2809.20 --> 2809.58]  Yeah.
[2809.84 --> 2813.00]  In classic wow, you were not allowed to get to Mount Hyjal.
[2813.24 --> 2815.94]  So he probably has a similar screenshot set to me,
[2816.04 --> 2819.88]  which is glitching through many walls and over many things.
[2819.88 --> 2821.70]  And it takes like quite a while to get there.
[2821.78 --> 2823.80]  And you're just like screwing the game repeatedly.
[2823.96 --> 2828.38]  And you get to a part of the game that has like Blizzard Co. construction signs.
[2828.76 --> 2831.22]  And there's stuff that never got released that's in there.
[2831.92 --> 2832.10]  Hmm.
[2832.44 --> 2836.52]  Like Archimons, like big giant skull leaning up against this tree and stuff,
[2836.56 --> 2837.76]  which was never in the game.
[2838.24 --> 2839.72]  So it was actually super cool.
[2839.86 --> 2841.12]  And it was glitchers.
[2841.30 --> 2843.38]  It wasn't necessarily just people that are interested in wow,
[2843.38 --> 2844.92]  because I was a glitcher back then.
[2845.04 --> 2847.84]  I broke like every single aspect of Halo 2.
[2847.84 --> 2848.84]  I was like, oh, I'm going to talk to you.
[2848.84 --> 2849.84]  I'm going to talk to you.
[2849.84 --> 2850.84]  I'm going to talk to you.
[2850.84 --> 2852.30]  I haven't talked to you in many years.
[2852.30 --> 2856.08]  But this guy named Utah Crusher, him and I used to play Halo 2 together.
[2856.72 --> 2861.40]  And we were like in the first group of people that found the switching from rocket to a sword
[2861.40 --> 2863.30]  and flying across the entire map glitch.
[2863.84 --> 2864.94]  If you knew that one.
[2865.06 --> 2865.80]  I killed Hogger.
[2865.90 --> 2867.70]  You would do this thing where the rocket...
[2867.70 --> 2868.48]  I killed Hogger.
[2868.48 --> 2873.22]  The rocket, you could aim at someone and it would show red because you were targeting them, right?
[2874.00 --> 2874.56]  Do you remember that?
[2875.10 --> 2876.12]  I never played Halo 2.
[2876.20 --> 2877.10]  That's an Xbox game.
[2877.84 --> 2878.64]  Okay, whatever, man.
[2878.96 --> 2881.06]  I think it happened in Halo 1, too.
[2881.44 --> 2884.38]  If you aimed over top of someone, the aimer would turn red.
[2886.42 --> 2886.86]  Anyways.
[2886.88 --> 2887.46]  I don't remember.
[2887.84 --> 2888.84]  That was a long time ago.
[2889.00 --> 2890.00]  That was like a state.
[2890.46 --> 2895.22]  And the sword, if the aimer was red, you would lunge towards them and the state was shared.
[2895.22 --> 2901.00]  So if you switched it fast enough and lunged, it wouldn't notice that it wasn't in that state anymore.
[2901.18 --> 2902.88]  So it would let you lunge to the person.
[2903.16 --> 2906.00]  But they're super far away because it's the targeting from the rocket launcher.
[2906.34 --> 2908.48]  So you just like, shoof, and just fly at them.
[2908.86 --> 2909.58]  It was pretty cool.
[2909.74 --> 2910.76]  We did a lot of other stuff, too.
[2911.10 --> 2912.06]  I'm going to stop talking.
[2912.06 --> 2912.86]  So I'll say this.
[2914.54 --> 2919.32]  Many, many of the screenshots were just like, here's me and this other person in a meadow.
[2920.04 --> 2920.40]  Oh.
[2920.84 --> 2921.98]  It was really bad.
[2921.98 --> 2926.28]  So, okay, anyway, back to the topic.
[2927.54 --> 2931.08]  Some of the stuff NVIDIA's building doesn't make a ton of sense to me, like Ansel.
[2931.70 --> 2934.46]  But some of the stuff they're building does make a ton of sense.
[2934.92 --> 2936.74]  Things like streaming.
[2939.14 --> 2941.30]  Better GPU-based encoding and decoding.
[2941.54 --> 2943.48]  All that kind of stuff does make sense to me.
[2943.48 --> 2955.44]  So pretty much what they're doing is they're kind of going, we don't even need to develop a much, much faster GPU every year.
[2955.44 --> 2970.14]  We're just going to put more tech in it to the point where even if the RX Vega 556 was the same price as a GTX 1070, NVIDIA's whole thing on their side is like, we still think you should buy a 1070 anyway.
[2970.14 --> 2972.94]  Because we do release day drivers every time.
[2973.38 --> 2974.82]  Oh, by the way, they're Wickel-Lol.
[2976.72 --> 2978.54]  And then we've got all this other tech.
[2978.66 --> 2982.74]  We've got Shadowplay and all that kind of stuff built into it.
[2983.26 --> 2987.52]  And, you know, AMD's approach is, oh, yeah, but like our approach is open.
[2987.52 --> 2989.52]  But you look at sometimes...
[2990.06 --> 2991.58]  But NVIDIA started opening stuff up too, though.
[2991.88 --> 2996.16]  Sometimes open makes sense, but only if you're actually doing any work.
[2996.96 --> 2997.10]  Yeah.
[2997.20 --> 3003.34]  Because like, look at how, okay, so stereoscopic 3D, however much of an abortion you may or may not think it is.
[3004.20 --> 3007.14]  NVIDIA did a better job because they actually did work on it.
[3007.44 --> 3015.56]  Whereas AMD was just like, yeah, through IZ3D and whatever that other thing was, you can enable stereoscopic 3D on our cards.
[3015.56 --> 3017.38]  But they were these janky 3D cards.
[3017.44 --> 3018.60]  Did you ever try IZ3D?
[3019.06 --> 3019.94]  No, I didn't.
[3020.00 --> 3020.48]  It was awful.
[3020.50 --> 3021.78]  I never did NVIDIA's 3D stuff either.
[3021.98 --> 3022.86]  It was awful.
[3023.46 --> 3030.12]  Like, if you think 3D is bad, imagine 3D, but like, there's no oxygen in the room.
[3030.14 --> 3032.50]  So just to say 3D ready or whatever.
[3032.72 --> 3032.84]  Yeah.
[3032.98 --> 3035.56]  Just to have the checkbox.
[3035.64 --> 3036.34]  It was super bad.
[3036.42 --> 3036.58]  Yeah.
[3037.08 --> 3038.70]  We did testing for that a long time ago.
[3038.72 --> 3039.76]  People are telling me to shut up.
[3040.88 --> 3043.30]  I think like three quarters of the chat is, Dimitri!
[3044.56 --> 3045.04]  Dimitri!
[3045.56 --> 3047.20]  In the chat.
[3047.66 --> 3047.90]  Yeah.
[3048.52 --> 3049.50]  So much of it.
[3049.82 --> 3050.38]  You talked.
[3050.80 --> 3051.06]  Yeah.
[3051.20 --> 3052.34]  I mean, you gave them what they wanted.
[3052.68 --> 3053.36]  Okay, here.
[3053.46 --> 3055.42]  I've got something for Dimitri to discuss.
[3055.82 --> 3057.48]  This was posted by Perino on the forum.
[3057.56 --> 3059.68]  The original article here is from Ars Technica.
[3060.24 --> 3061.70]  And this blew my mind.
[3063.28 --> 3068.14]  Bing is bigger than you think, says Microsoft, with a quarter of UK searches.
[3068.84 --> 3069.32]  Whoa.
[3069.58 --> 3069.84]  Wow.
[3071.02 --> 3073.14]  So they're saying a quarter of the searches are from UK?
[3073.14 --> 3074.08]  No.
[3074.60 --> 3075.14]  No, no.
[3075.14 --> 3079.92]  A quarter of the UK's searches are using Bing.
[3079.92 --> 3085.26]  10% in Spain, 19% in France, 9% in...
[3085.26 --> 3086.50]  What type of use, though, is it?
[3086.58 --> 3087.54]  Whatever that is.
[3087.78 --> 3088.42]  What are they searching?
[3089.24 --> 3092.02]  They're just looking to buy, to download Chrome.
[3095.96 --> 3097.52]  That's probably legit, man.
[3098.36 --> 3101.74]  Apparently, Taiwan is as high as 25%?
[3101.74 --> 3104.06]  Dude, the US is 33%.
[3104.06 --> 3104.46]  Yeah.
[3104.68 --> 3104.96]  What?
[3105.32 --> 3106.72]  The US is the biggest percentage.
[3108.02 --> 3109.24]  16% Canada.
[3109.78 --> 3111.20]  But these are just...
[3111.20 --> 3112.30]  What type of use?
[3112.46 --> 3114.62]  These are just figures being put out by...
[3114.62 --> 3116.06]  Denmark is the lowest percentage.
[3116.86 --> 3122.78]  Because they may be just using type to search, which uses Bing as your search result.
[3122.86 --> 3128.50]  I love how they're saying Bing is bigger than you think, and then there's literally multiple single-digit percentages.
[3129.36 --> 3129.62]  Yeah.
[3129.74 --> 3130.96]  That is bigger than I think.
[3130.96 --> 3133.56]  To be fair, yeah, but, like, damn, guys.
[3133.96 --> 3138.96]  I honestly think, like Demetri said, that's just because they're searching for another browser to download on new installs.
[3138.96 --> 3143.06]  But 33% of all traffic in the USA is not searching for another browser to download.
[3143.50 --> 3145.10]  Like, I'm not even just trying to be devil's advocate.
[3145.22 --> 3145.56]  That's not...
[3146.78 --> 3147.40]  There's no way.
[3147.44 --> 3148.40]  So if they're using Cortana?
[3148.58 --> 3149.72]  Yeah, Cortana uses Bing.
[3149.94 --> 3151.28]  So anytime you type that in...
[3151.28 --> 3151.50]  Oh.
[3151.84 --> 3152.50]  Click enter.
[3152.82 --> 3153.34]  It...
[3153.34 --> 3155.24]  So that's just a falsified...
[3155.24 --> 3158.60]  Not really falsified, but it's skewed and that's making it look like...
[3158.60 --> 3158.82]  That's using Bing.
[3158.82 --> 3160.12]  But I'm not going to Bing.
[3160.12 --> 3164.42]  I don't use Cortana to begin with, but if I do a search or something down here, I'm not searching Bing.
[3164.50 --> 3167.12]  I'm just searching here, usually for something on my system, but...
[3167.68 --> 3169.02]  Yeah, but that doesn't work anyway.
[3169.18 --> 3173.60]  Most of the time, it just gives you driver download from online.
[3173.66 --> 3181.52]  But it searches the internet simultaneously when you search for something local, so that's not necessarily a good representation of Bing usage.
[3181.86 --> 3184.24]  Yeah, that and I accidentally use Bing a lot.
[3184.60 --> 3185.00]  Accidentally?
[3185.00 --> 3186.76]  So you contribute to that...
[3186.76 --> 3187.16]  How many?
[3187.30 --> 3187.88]  13%?
[3188.22 --> 3189.32]  16% in Canada.
[3189.78 --> 3194.36]  So I'll launch Edge because I haven't bothered to install another browser yet, and I'll search for something.
[3194.42 --> 3195.26]  I'll be like, oh crap.
[3195.94 --> 3197.80]  And then I'll have to search for Google.
[3198.02 --> 3201.10]  Someone in chat just said Alexa uses Bing, and Alexa's huge in the States.
[3202.10 --> 3202.22]  Hmm.
[3202.78 --> 3203.66]  Oh, okay.
[3203.66 --> 3206.24]  That would maybe make sense why it's 33% there.
[3206.38 --> 3208.78]  Because apparently globally, it's about 9%.
[3208.78 --> 3209.94]  Hmm.
[3209.94 --> 3210.46]  Ouch.
[3211.12 --> 3213.32]  And then 33% in the USA.
[3213.46 --> 3214.14]  That's huge.
[3217.78 --> 3220.08]  Even like Hong Kong is 20%.
[3220.08 --> 3220.10]  Sirius is Bing.
[3220.90 --> 3221.38]  Sirius.
[3221.42 --> 3222.06]  That can't be right.
[3222.20 --> 3223.30]  I'm pretty sure that's not right.
[3223.98 --> 3225.26]  Bing is for porn, apparently.
[3226.56 --> 3227.00]  What?
[3227.80 --> 3233.60]  Yeah, so a certain friend of ours in Seattle would say that, like, I guess the algorithm for that is way better.
[3234.40 --> 3234.62]  Oh.
[3234.88 --> 3236.18]  A certain friend of ours in Seattle?
[3236.74 --> 3237.06]  Yeah.
[3237.06 --> 3240.08]  Well, I'm not getting involved in that.
[3240.66 --> 3242.96]  Thanks for tuning into the WAN Show, you guys.
[3243.94 --> 3249.38]  Thanks again to Jay and Dimitri, not only for being here for Scrapyard Wars, but also for being here on the show.
[3249.50 --> 3252.86]  So you can find Jay over at, I mean, I know the answer.
[3253.08 --> 3253.54]  Jay's two cents.
[3254.02 --> 3254.52]  With a Z.
[3254.80 --> 3255.92]  Not to be confused with the wrapper.
[3256.42 --> 3256.62]  Yeah.
[3257.54 --> 3259.38]  And us at Hardware Canucks.
[3264.90 --> 3265.14]  Click.
[3265.14 --> 3267.14]  Yeah, I'm just, I'm leaving it because it's funny.
[3267.46 --> 3267.66]  Oh.
[3267.74 --> 3268.20]  I'll do it.
[3268.26 --> 3268.56]  There you go.
[3268.80 --> 3274.14]  Oh, we should have done a special intro with, like, you guys, like, on planes coming here.
[3274.62 --> 3275.74]  That would have been real cool.
[3277.62 --> 3278.64]  If I could share some footage.
[3278.64 --> 3279.46]  They're like biplanes.
[3280.16 --> 3281.10]  Little scarves and goggles.
[3281.42 --> 3282.28]  Did you do, like, a vlog?
[3283.60 --> 3284.80]  Did you do, like, a vlog?
[3285.02 --> 3285.26]  Yeah.
[3285.32 --> 3285.70]  Is it even sure?
[3285.82 --> 3286.10]  Cool.
[3286.52 --> 3287.34]  Are you putting that on your channel?
[3287.52 --> 3287.70]  Yeah.
[3287.70 --> 3290.26]  If you want to see a travel vlog, go to Dimitri's channel.
[3290.90 --> 3291.36]  Hardware Canucks.
[3291.36 --> 3291.80]  Hardware Canucks.
[3293.20 --> 3294.26]  Is that my personal channel?
[3294.66 --> 3295.20]  Oh, no, no.
[3295.32 --> 3296.64]  I'm collecting stuff still.
[3296.82 --> 3297.00]  Oh.
[3297.18 --> 3297.34]  Yeah.
[3297.94 --> 3298.52]  That'll be good, though.
[3298.54 --> 3298.88]  That'll be good.
[3298.88 --> 3328.86]  Thank you.
