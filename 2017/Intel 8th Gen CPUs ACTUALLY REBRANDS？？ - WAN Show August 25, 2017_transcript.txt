[0.00 --> 5.96]  Welcome to the Wancho! Starting again!
[5.96 --> 6.46]  Yay!
[6.46 --> 9.66]  Which will make no sense to those of you watching the vibe.
[9.66 --> 10.46]  Yay!
[10.46 --> 11.46]  We've got...
[11.46 --> 13.46]  We're totally doing this for the first time.
[13.46 --> 16.60]  We've actually got some pretty crap topics this week.
[16.60 --> 17.40]  No!
[17.40 --> 18.40]  Yup, they're crap.
[18.40 --> 19.90]  We do have a couple...
[19.90 --> 20.90]  We can polish it.
[20.90 --> 22.90]  We...
[22.90 --> 26.70]  You can polish the crap as long as it's not diarrhea.
[26.70 --> 30.70]  Oh, man.
[30.70 --> 32.70]  Try and polish diarrhea, you just end up with a...
[32.70 --> 33.70]  That would be a more advanced process.
[33.70 --> 34.70]  With a poop smear.
[34.70 --> 38.70]  Well, you could like put it in like an ice cube tray.
[38.70 --> 40.70]  Oh, so you freeze it.
[40.70 --> 41.70]  Freeze it.
[41.70 --> 42.70]  Freeze it, then polish it.
[42.70 --> 43.70]  Yeah.
[43.70 --> 44.70]  That could work.
[44.70 --> 45.70]  More work.
[45.70 --> 46.70]  That could work.
[46.70 --> 48.70]  I mean, can you imagine a poop ice cube?
[48.70 --> 51.70]  Like, what would be an appropriate context for that?
[51.70 --> 53.70]  I mean, if you're...
[53.70 --> 57.70]  If you need improvised projectiles, that might also cause disease.
[57.70 --> 58.70]  Yeah.
[58.70 --> 61.70]  So if you're this far into the show and you're thinking, hmm, is this gonna be one of those
[61.70 --> 65.70]  ones where they actually have tech news or is this gonna be one of the ones where they
[65.70 --> 67.70]  just BS for an hour?
[67.70 --> 69.70]  Hopefully that's already clear.
[69.70 --> 70.70]  Yeah.
[70.70 --> 71.70]  We do have some...
[71.70 --> 72.70]  We do have some real topics though.
[72.70 --> 75.70]  Crash plan for home says au revoir.
[75.70 --> 76.70]  Au revoir.
[76.70 --> 78.70]  That's goodbye in Italian.
[78.70 --> 82.70]  Um, they are pulling out of the home market.
[82.70 --> 86.70]  Samsung's boss and heir jailed for corruption.
[86.70 --> 87.70]  Jailed.
[87.70 --> 89.70]  Oh, this just in.
[89.70 --> 95.70]  Intel's 8th generation mobile processors are just updated 7th generation tips.
[95.70 --> 96.70]  Tips?
[96.70 --> 97.70]  Chips.
[97.70 --> 98.70]  They're not tips at all.
[98.70 --> 99.70]  Oops.
[100.70 --> 101.70]  I'm sorry.
[101.70 --> 102.70]  I'm having one of those days.
[102.70 --> 104.70]  But the tip of them has been updated.
[104.70 --> 105.70]  I'm gonna argue jet lag.
[105.70 --> 107.70]  But it's essentially the same jet lag.
[107.70 --> 110.70]  You know I was in New York this week, right?
[110.70 --> 111.70]  Yeah, but didn't...
[111.70 --> 112.70]  Oh no, you got back yesterday.
[112.70 --> 113.70]  I got back...
[113.70 --> 114.70]  Okay.
[114.70 --> 115.70]  I got...
[115.70 --> 122.70]  Okay, I was at the airport in New York at 5.30 Eastern time yesterday.
[122.70 --> 123.70]  Whoa.
[123.70 --> 132.70]  So at 3.30 home time, I was at an airport getting on what would have been a 5.30 our time flight.
[132.70 --> 133.70]  Getting off.
[133.70 --> 134.70]  No, on.
[134.70 --> 135.70]  Boarding.
[135.70 --> 136.70]  At this airport?
[136.70 --> 137.70]  At that airport.
[137.70 --> 138.70]  Oh.
[138.70 --> 146.70]  Then I flew for 6 hours and I got off the plane at 10.30 a.m. our time and came to the office for the day.
[146.70 --> 147.70]  So I'm going with it.
[147.70 --> 148.70]  I'm going with the jet lag.
[148.70 --> 151.70]  You did seem very tired that day and I was like, huh?
[151.70 --> 152.70]  Okay, sure.
[152.70 --> 156.70]  Well, did you notice that I was only gone for about 35 hours?
[156.70 --> 157.70]  No.
[157.70 --> 158.70]  I wasn't here.
[158.70 --> 159.70]  Yeah.
[159.70 --> 162.70]  To New York and back, plus doing the entire Samsung event on my own.
[162.70 --> 163.70]  On your own?
[163.70 --> 165.70]  Okay, I only vaguely heard about this.
[165.70 --> 166.70]  I had no camera person.
[166.70 --> 167.70]  Why?
[167.70 --> 168.70]  Because...
[168.70 --> 169.70]  You know what?
[169.70 --> 170.70]  Okay, we'll get to it after the intro.
[170.70 --> 171.70]  Okay.
[171.70 --> 173.70]  So the Vega shortage could last until October.
[173.70 --> 174.70]  Intro.
[174.70 --> 175.70]  Boom.
[175.70 --> 178.70]  I mean, who really cares anyway?
[178.70 --> 179.70]  Who is buying Vega?
[179.70 --> 180.70]  Okay, does this work?
[180.70 --> 181.70]  I don't know.
[181.70 --> 182.70]  Uh, not yet.
[182.70 --> 183.70]  Okay.
[183.70 --> 184.70]  What the crap?
[184.70 --> 185.70]  Wait, what about the other one?
[185.70 --> 186.70]  Why don't I just try the other one?
[186.70 --> 187.70]  Yeah, yeah.
[187.70 --> 188.70]  Okay.
[188.70 --> 189.70]  Sponsors.
[189.70 --> 190.70]  Fresh books!
[190.70 --> 191.70]  They're books that are fresh.
[191.70 --> 192.70]  Savage jerky!
[192.70 --> 193.70]  It's less fresh because it's preserved.
[193.70 --> 194.70]  Because it's jerky and smoked.
[194.70 --> 195.70]  But relative.
[195.70 --> 196.70]  Relative.
[196.70 --> 197.70]  Yeah.
[197.70 --> 198.70]  I mean, who really cares anyway?
[198.70 --> 199.70]  Who is buying Vega?
[199.70 --> 200.70]  Okay, does this work?
[200.70 --> 201.70]  I don't know.
[201.70 --> 202.70]  Uh, not yet.
[202.70 --> 203.70]  Okay.
[203.70 --> 204.70]  What the crap?
[204.70 --> 205.70]  Wait, what about the other one?
[205.70 --> 206.70]  Why don't I just try the other one?
[206.70 --> 207.70]  Yeah, yeah.
[207.70 --> 208.70]  Relative.
[208.70 --> 209.70]  To jerky.
[209.70 --> 210.70]  Yeah, relative to other jerky.
[210.70 --> 211.70]  I guess it's fresh.
[211.70 --> 212.70]  Yeah.
[212.70 --> 214.70]  In that there's less preservatives than nitrates.
[214.70 --> 215.70]  Yeah.
[215.70 --> 216.70]  Okay, hold on.
[216.70 --> 217.70]  I'm gonna put this back.
[217.70 --> 218.70]  Let me see.
[218.70 --> 220.70]  But why isn't my screen share working?
[220.70 --> 221.70]  Confused.
[221.70 --> 222.70]  Confused.
[222.70 --> 224.70]  Disappointed!
[224.70 --> 226.70]  Confused and disappointed.
[226.70 --> 227.70]  And, uh, hold on.
[227.70 --> 228.70]  I didn't have the thing on.
[228.70 --> 229.70]  And, no, it's...
[229.70 --> 230.70]  Still not working.
[230.70 --> 231.70]  Still not working.
[231.70 --> 233.70]  I don't understand!
[233.70 --> 234.70]  Okay.
[234.70 --> 235.70]  Um, also...
[235.70 --> 236.70]  This might be...
[236.70 --> 237.70]  This is like...
[237.70 --> 238.70]  This is the official end.
[238.70 --> 239.70]  Is that...
[239.70 --> 240.70]  The official end of...
[240.70 --> 241.70]  XSplit?
[241.70 --> 242.70]  The end of XSplit?
[242.70 --> 243.70]  I don't know.
[243.70 --> 244.70]  Okay, well that's...
[244.70 --> 246.70]  Because, A-V-I-O...
[246.70 --> 248.70]  Um, has issues with XSplit.
[248.70 --> 249.70]  Yeah.
[249.70 --> 250.70]  And blames it on XSplit.
[250.70 --> 253.70]  And refuses to do things because they blame it on XSplit.
[253.70 --> 254.70]  Yeah, that's, um...
[254.70 --> 255.70]  It's not...
[255.70 --> 256.70]  Epiphan.
[256.70 --> 257.70]  Epiphan.
[257.70 --> 258.70]  Yeah, no, I'm...
[258.70 --> 260.70]  So, okay, that's probably a topic of discussion.
[260.70 --> 263.70]  Is it finally time for us to move to OBS?
[263.70 --> 265.70]  Let's find out.
[265.70 --> 272.70]  Um, and actually another good discussion topic that we've got here is, is float plane dying?
[272.70 --> 273.70]  What?
[273.70 --> 279.70]  I don't know what would make people think that, but that is definitely a, uh, I'm stoked on that as a topic of conversation.
[279.70 --> 281.70]  What is that topic? Where does that come from?
[281.70 --> 283.70]  I have no idea where that came from.
[283.70 --> 285.70]  Was that just, like, posted in the doc?
[285.70 --> 289.70]  What were we talking about before we rolled the intro and I said we were gonna talk about it after the intro?
[289.70 --> 290.70]  Uh...
[292.70 --> 293.70]  I don't know.
[293.70 --> 294.70]  Crap.
[294.70 --> 297.70]  I have no idea whatsoever.
[297.70 --> 299.70]  Maybe Twitch chat will help us with this.
[299.70 --> 301.70]  Is float plane dying? Where did you get that from?
[301.70 --> 303.70]  But I'm, uh...
[303.70 --> 304.70]  It's not.
[304.70 --> 305.70]  Yeah, it's not.
[305.70 --> 306.70]  Hold on, are they gonna help us?
[306.70 --> 307.70]  It's doing quite well.
[307.70 --> 309.70]  People are asking if I dye my hair.
[309.70 --> 310.70]  Oh, the trip to New York, that's right.
[310.70 --> 311.70]  Ah!
[311.70 --> 312.70]  Why did I dye my hair?
[312.70 --> 313.70]  I'm only 31.
[313.70 --> 315.70]  I can't believe I'm 31.
[315.70 --> 318.70]  That's not too bad.
[318.70 --> 319.70]  It's not too great.
[319.70 --> 321.70]  You look like a very young 31.
[321.70 --> 322.70]  Thanks.
[322.70 --> 328.70]  That's like saying, you know, for a corpse, you really don't look that decomposed.
[328.70 --> 330.70]  You don't look like you're in your 30s.
[330.70 --> 331.70]  So don't worry about it.
[331.70 --> 333.70]  I wouldn't assume that you're in your 30s.
[333.70 --> 336.70]  You've aged a lot since you, like, had kids and started this group.
[336.70 --> 337.70]  Thanks.
[337.70 --> 338.70]  But me too!
[338.70 --> 339.70]  It started nice!
[339.70 --> 340.70]  It started nice!
[340.70 --> 344.70]  It started, you look really great for your 30s, then it's like, but wow man, you are really
[344.70 --> 346.70]  on a downward slope, dude.
[346.70 --> 347.70]  I am too!
[347.70 --> 349.70]  Yeah, but you can just shave your beard and you'll...
[349.70 --> 351.70]  Right back to baby face!
[351.70 --> 352.70]  It's not fair!
[352.70 --> 353.70]  It looks horrible though.
[353.70 --> 354.70]  It doesn't...
[354.70 --> 355.70]  Well...
[355.70 --> 357.70]  Okay, yeah, you know what?
[357.70 --> 360.70]  I'm going after it because this is payback time, baby.
[360.70 --> 361.70]  Alright.
[361.70 --> 362.70]  Your face looks horrible enough that you have to hide it behind here.
[362.70 --> 363.70]  Bam!
[363.70 --> 364.70]  That's right!
[364.70 --> 365.70]  Screw you, dick!
[365.70 --> 366.70]  I'm maybe old, but at least I can show my face!
[366.70 --> 367.70]  Where is it?
[367.70 --> 368.70]  I wonder if I can find it.
[368.70 --> 370.70]  There's the Instagram post from when I had to shave for that video that we didn't get
[370.70 --> 371.70]  to release.
[371.70 --> 372.70]  Yeah, I know.
[372.70 --> 373.70]  Oh, the comments on there are hilarious.
[373.70 --> 374.70]  I know, they're so bad.
[374.70 --> 375.70]  I think there's people that, like, legitimately think I'm a different person.
[375.70 --> 390.48]  Okay, but you know what though, in your defense, I think part of why it doesn't work for you, though, is because your hairdo is kind of like, you have like, a choir board or a
[390.48 --> 391.48]  choir boy...
[391.48 --> 392.48]  I think it did better when I had like, the spikes.
[392.48 --> 393.48]  Yeah.
[393.48 --> 408.48]  You have a choir boy hairdo, but then you offset it with the kind of rugged facial hair.
[408.48 --> 409.48]  Yeah.
[409.48 --> 414.48]  So when you have like, the no facial hair, and then you just have like, the nice kind of...
[414.48 --> 415.48]  Yeah.
[415.48 --> 417.48]  You just, you go kind of like, yeah, kind of choir boy.
[417.48 --> 418.48]  Yeah.
[418.48 --> 422.48]  I think when I had, when I had the spikes, or when I just had like, the faux hawk kind
[422.48 --> 425.48]  of deal, or just short hair in general, I think it, I think it did a little bit better.
[425.48 --> 426.48]  Yeah.
[426.48 --> 428.48]  Okay, so we were supposed to talk about the trip to New York.
[428.48 --> 429.48]  Yes.
[429.48 --> 430.48]  Okay, so here's what went down.
[430.48 --> 431.48]  Okay.
[431.48 --> 434.48]  I have never been invited to a Samsung launch event before.
[434.48 --> 436.48]  This is the first time...
[436.48 --> 438.48]  Oh, because you've just had like, the meetings.
[438.48 --> 439.48]  Yeah.
[439.48 --> 442.48]  So I've had meetings with like, Samsung Canada.
[442.48 --> 443.48]  Yeah.
[443.48 --> 447.48]  Where I'll go to like, a hotel in Vancouver, or a restaurant one time, and...
[447.48 --> 454.48]  I'll get briefed on the phone, and a lot of the time, this is like a week or two after...
[454.48 --> 455.48]  Yes.
[455.48 --> 462.48]  Like the Unpacked event, and Marques, and Jonathan Morrison, and Austin, all those guys like,
[462.48 --> 463.48]  have full reviews up.
[463.48 --> 468.48]  And I'm getting briefed, and I'm seeing the device for the first time, because, get this,
[468.48 --> 471.48]  because, it's just launching in Canada now.
[471.48 --> 472.48]  Yeah.
[473.48 --> 475.48]  Which is like, super stupid.
[475.48 --> 480.48]  As though I should give any cares, when it launches in Canada.
[481.48 --> 484.48]  Nobody cares, when a device launches in Canada.
[484.48 --> 486.48]  And the kind of stuff they'll cover at these briefings is great.
[486.48 --> 491.48]  They're like, yeah, and the blue color is going to be available exclusively on Rogers.
[493.48 --> 495.48]  Why, I did that, but...
[495.48 --> 496.48]  Okay.
[496.48 --> 500.48]  Someone will find out from the video that they're interested in the phone, go to Rogers.com,
[500.48 --> 502.48]  and be like, oh, there's blue.
[502.48 --> 503.48]  And they'll buy it.
[503.48 --> 504.48]  Cool.
[504.48 --> 506.48]  And then they'll slap a skin on it anyways.
[506.48 --> 510.48]  Or they'll never go to Rogers.com, and never know that they had a blue one, and not care.
[511.48 --> 512.48]  Yeah.
[512.48 --> 513.48]  In all likelihood.
[513.48 --> 514.48]  If we're being honest right now.
[514.48 --> 515.48]  A vast, vast percentage of people.
[515.48 --> 517.48]  So that's what always happened.
[517.48 --> 525.48]  So I was super stoked to get an invite to the Samsung Unpacked event, because that meant that I could actually do a hands-on video at the same time that...
[525.48 --> 530.48]  And every other press in the world, mind you, The Verge had an article, or had a video up,
[530.48 --> 534.48]  while Austin and I were sitting there at the audience going, why do we even attend these things?
[534.48 --> 536.48]  Like, honestly.
[536.48 --> 537.48]  Ugh.
[537.48 --> 539.48]  Why are we even here?
[539.48 --> 540.48]  What's the point?
[540.48 --> 543.48]  But that's a whole other conversation.
[543.48 --> 545.48]  The Verge had a video.
[545.48 --> 548.48]  So they invited me up, and I was like, oh, this is great.
[548.48 --> 549.48]  Yeah, I'd love to go do it.
[549.48 --> 551.48]  You know, you want to build that relationship.
[551.48 --> 556.48]  I want to be timely on mobile stuff, if I can at all manage to do it.
[556.48 --> 563.48]  And then I'm like, okay, yeah, so we need two tickets, me and a camera person, which I think is fairly reasonable for a publication of our impact.
[563.48 --> 568.48]  And they're like, oh, sorry, you can't bring a camera person.
[568.48 --> 574.48]  And I'm like, okay, well, can I just pay for their ticket and pay for their hotel?
[574.48 --> 575.48]  Or even just share a room?
[575.48 --> 576.48]  Like, I don't care.
[576.48 --> 581.48]  Like, most of the camera people here I'm buddy-buddy enough with that we could just share a room, no problem.
[581.48 --> 586.48]  And then they're like, no, we can't get you another ticket for the event.
[586.48 --> 589.48]  So even if I brought my own camera person there-
[589.48 --> 590.48]  You can't get them inside.
[590.48 --> 596.48]  They could only get me one ticket into the event because, again, it's because I'm going through Samsung Canada.
[596.48 --> 601.48]  Samsung Canada had 12 tickets for the entire country.
[601.48 --> 607.48]  I was going as far as like, is this like a fire marshal issue? Like they literally can't bring more people into the building?
[607.48 --> 613.48]  It was full. But the problem is that Canada's allocation was so little of it that-
[613.48 --> 614.48]  Right.
[614.48 --> 618.48]  That- so Austin had three people there.
[619.48 --> 626.48]  Because- but he didn't get his hotel and flight paid for and he didn't get like- there was this activation after where-
[626.48 --> 627.48]  Why did he need three people?
[627.48 --> 634.48]  I was supposed to have- like, get this, I was supposed to have two to three thousand dollars to go experience New York with the Note 8.
[634.48 --> 637.48]  And they were like, yeah, you could do like a chopper flight or you could do this, you could-
[637.48 --> 642.48]  I didn't end up doing anything because I was busy editing my stupid video that I shot that day.
[642.48 --> 644.48]  So I didn't even end up using it.
[644.48 --> 652.48]  But it was like, you guys- you guys have all this like, influencer budget, but I can't bring a camera person to the event with me. Come on.
[652.48 --> 656.48]  So Austin didn't have that because that was just something Samsung Canada was doing.
[656.48 --> 662.48]  But this just all leads back to like a larger fundamental issue, which is how fragmented-
[662.48 --> 663.48]  Disconnected.
[663.48 --> 664.48]  Yes!
[664.48 --> 670.48]  Where one company, Samsung, okay, they have The Verge going live with-
[670.48 --> 674.48]  I don't know why hashtag free Luke is being spammed. I don't know what it means.
[674.48 --> 675.48]  I don't know what that is.
[675.48 --> 680.48]  So they have the- one company has The Verge going live with a preview-
[680.48 --> 681.48]  Yeah.
[681.48 --> 683.48]  While the entire rest of the world press-
[683.48 --> 686.48]  Which has like astronomically more views than the rest of the stuff in their channel.
[686.48 --> 691.48]  While the entire rest of the world press is sitting in an auditorium waiting for the presentation to start.
[691.48 --> 699.48]  They've got the US and Canada and whatever other countries with Wonko allocations for press.
[699.48 --> 700.48]  Not every one.
[700.48 --> 701.48]  They've got-
[701.48 --> 704.48]  And they've got completely different programs for-
[704.48 --> 711.48]  I would consider myself and Austin pretty similar in terms of what we are.
[711.48 --> 714.48]  YouTubers, influencers, like we fall in the same category.
[714.48 --> 720.48]  And he's got to buy his flight, buy his hotel, but he can get as many tickets as he wants.
[720.48 --> 727.48]  I get a free flight, free hotel, and a few grand to spend on doing something cool in New York, but I can't bring a camera operator.
[727.48 --> 728.48]  Yeah.
[728.48 --> 730.48]  So it's just all over the place.
[730.48 --> 736.48]  And I just, I feel like somewhere, at some point-
[736.48 --> 745.48]  What could have even been sort of interesting is if they gave you like one of those phone gyro things, and like you were able to bring an editor.
[745.48 --> 746.48]  Yeah.
[746.48 --> 749.48]  And they got you to like film the whole thing on the phone.
[749.48 --> 750.48]  Yeah.
[750.48 --> 754.48]  And they like gave you a phone to talk about in display, and they give you a phone to film with.
[754.48 --> 755.48]  Yeah.
[755.48 --> 756.48]  And you're able to bring an editor so they can actually edit the video.
[756.48 --> 757.48]  Exactly.
[757.48 --> 759.48]  That would be pretty neat.
[759.48 --> 761.48]  And the other thing too though is consistency.
[761.48 --> 764.48]  Like, no one's going to be upset if everyone's kind of doing the same thing.
[764.48 --> 765.48]  Yeah.
[765.48 --> 787.48]  But like honestly, and I don't mean, I hope she, I sincerely doubt she's watching, but there was another person in the media, on the media side of the presentation, that was sincerely taking notes from the presentation on a little pad of paper, and wrote down like 10 things.
[787.48 --> 790.48]  And I'm kind of sitting here going like, how are you even covering this?
[790.48 --> 795.48]  Like, what are you, are you going to fold that up, tie it to a pigeon, and mail it to someone?
[795.48 --> 796.48]  Like, what are you doing?
[796.48 --> 798.48]  What are you doing such that you are-
[798.48 --> 800.48]  I've taken written notes before.
[800.48 --> 805.48]  Such that you are relevant enough to be here, and that you're, yeah, but she wasn't, it wasn't a speed thing.
[805.48 --> 808.48]  Cause she didn't even write my anything.
[808.48 --> 809.48]  Okay.
[809.48 --> 810.48]  And she was sitting right in front of me.
[810.48 --> 815.48]  And I'm sitting here going, what could you possibly be doing that doesn't require you to digitize this at some point?
[815.48 --> 816.48]  Yeah.
[816.48 --> 821.48]  One of the things that I like about paper notes, and I know this isn't what you're saying, I'm just, we have to talk a lot today cause we have no news.
[821.48 --> 822.48]  So I'm going for it.
[822.48 --> 823.48]  Yeah, hit it.
[823.48 --> 826.48]  Is that, it's kind of like the OneNote idea.
[826.48 --> 833.48]  If I had like a Surface book that I had folded back with a pen, then sure, but that's, I don't have, what, no?
[833.48 --> 835.48]  Stop.
[835.48 --> 840.48]  So like I can stop part way through and draw something or do whatever I need to do.
[840.48 --> 841.48]  Okay.
[841.48 --> 842.48]  She drew nothing.
[842.48 --> 843.48]  And the notepad was like this big.
[843.48 --> 844.48]  See, that's crazy.
[844.48 --> 845.48]  And like really hard to like use.
[845.48 --> 847.48]  See, I normally have big ones like this.
[847.48 --> 850.48]  And we're sitting in a dark auditorium because it's like a presentation.
[850.48 --> 851.48]  That's stupid.
[851.48 --> 852.48]  Yeah.
[852.48 --> 858.48]  Anytime that I've sat down at a presentation, if I had the option, I did laptop or even phone.
[858.48 --> 862.48]  But if I'm like being walked around a booth really quickly, I often just write.
[862.48 --> 863.48]  Right.
[863.48 --> 864.48]  Okay.
[864.48 --> 867.48]  So, you know, right tool for the job.
[867.48 --> 868.48]  And I totally get that.
[868.48 --> 871.48]  But it was just like, why are you even here?
[871.48 --> 872.48]  Yeah.
[872.48 --> 877.48]  Um, so what else we, what else we got for today actually?
[877.48 --> 881.48]  Oh, oh, why don't we talk about is Flowplane dying?
[881.48 --> 882.48]  Is Flowplane dying?
[882.48 --> 884.48]  I don't, I don't even understand.
[884.48 --> 885.48]  No.
[885.48 --> 886.48]  Okay.
[886.48 --> 887.48]  Is that it?
[887.48 --> 888.48]  Yeah, that was it.
[888.48 --> 891.48]  In other news, are we going to finally move to OBS?
[891.48 --> 894.48]  Because my laptop screen capture is still not working.
[894.48 --> 896.48]  Why don't you talk about pros and cons while I see if I can figure this out.
[896.48 --> 897.48]  Okay.
[897.48 --> 903.48]  So, uh, if people have watched my little stream, I don't know if I've ever talked about it on the WAN show,
[903.48 --> 918.48]  but I've done quite a few different attempts of moving off of XSplit to OBS because the amount of riiiing that happens from everybody about how OBS is so much better because it's open source convinced me to try it a few times.
[918.48 --> 923.48]  And I decided that I didn't like it every single time until recently.
[923.48 --> 926.48]  And I'm sure I'm going to receive an email about this or a tweet or something.
[926.48 --> 932.48]  Uh, but I've been having a huge amount of problems with XSplit and I'm not the only one.
[932.48 --> 938.48]  And a lot of them have to do with capture cards and other different types of things that we're trying to use.
[938.48 --> 946.48]  And I'm getting feedback from these companies that make these devices that it just doesn't work on XSplit.
[946.48 --> 949.48]  And they're blaming XSplit and they're refusing to do anything about it.
[949.48 --> 955.48]  So, like, I'm pretty sure the stream deck doesn't work on XSplit.
[955.48 --> 958.48]  And we've had tons of problems with it, right? Yeah, so the stream deck.
[958.48 --> 959.48]  Uh, I don't know.
[959.48 --> 960.48]  Wait, what just happened?
[960.48 --> 961.48]  Oh dear.
[961.48 --> 962.48]  Oh crap.
[962.48 --> 963.48]  Did you unplug the SDI one?
[963.48 --> 964.48]  Uh, maybe. Hold on.
[964.48 --> 966.48]  Well, we theoretically still have audio.
[966.48 --> 969.48]  So I'm just going to keep talking because you don't really need to see me anyways.
[969.48 --> 970.48]  Dang it!
[970.48 --> 976.48]  Um, so, continuing from there, I wanted to play Horizon Zero Dawn and I couldn't.
[976.48 --> 978.48]  So I started trying to look into OBS.
[978.48 --> 984.48]  And man, there's been some leaps and bounds in terms of how good and functional OBS is.
[984.48 --> 988.48]  And it's still, in my opinion, a very clunky UI.
[988.48 --> 995.48]  I think they have made a number of objectively terrible design decisions.
[995.48 --> 998.48]  But functionality-wise, it does really well.
[998.48 --> 1000.48]  The transgitter stuff, it does well with.
[1000.48 --> 1002.48]  The audio levels...
[1003.48 --> 1006.48]  The audio stuff on XSplit is just...
[1006.48 --> 1007.48]  Ah!
[1007.48 --> 1021.48]  Why there's just like a volume bar that you can change the level of and like a tiny, very hard-to-see level bounce that's just on the bottom of the volume bar, not in its own area, very difficult to see, is completely beyond me.
[1021.48 --> 1025.48]  And OBS has individual levels for all your things that are very easy to see all the time.
[1026.48 --> 1027.48]  That's wonderful!
[1027.48 --> 1035.48]  There's some really clunky things about it, but it works very well in terms of the back-end stuff.
[1035.48 --> 1047.48]  And we use Epiphan AVIO capture cards because they're wonderful and they don't like overheat and do other junky things that a lot of other capture cards that we've used have done.
[1047.48 --> 1050.48]  But they have compatibility issues with...
[1050.48 --> 1051.48]  XSplit!
[1051.48 --> 1052.48]  And talking...
[1052.48 --> 1055.48]  They kinda came up over the last little while, like we didn't used to.
[1055.48 --> 1056.48]  Yes.
[1056.48 --> 1058.48]  Yeah, it seems to be new.
[1060.48 --> 1062.48]  And that's very frustrating.
[1062.48 --> 1063.48]  So, yeah.
[1063.48 --> 1071.48]  Moving off of something that is theoretically paid for to something that is free, because the free thing is better, is just odd.
[1072.48 --> 1074.48]  Well, it's not that odd in this day and age, but...
[1074.48 --> 1075.48]  Yeah.
[1075.48 --> 1084.48]  Okay, so, uh, this next news item is actually from my email, so hopefully I don't expose anything critical, but it doesn't look like it.
[1085.48 --> 1089.48]  CrashPlanForHome is going away!
[1090.48 --> 1092.48]  Thank you for using CrashPlanForHome!
[1092.48 --> 1096.48]  We hope you have enjoyed the secure backup that the free version of CrashPlanForHome has provided.
[1096.48 --> 1103.48]  As of today, we've made the decision to shift our business strategy to focus on the enterprise and small business segments.
[1103.48 --> 1105.48]  Wow!
[1105.48 --> 1117.48]  So this kinda sucks, because CrashPlan was like the go-to for quick, painless, easy offsite backup of your entire system.
[1117.48 --> 1126.48]  So, in theory, and you know, there's some port forwarding and whatever else that goes along with it, but in theory, CrashPlan was as simple as going,
[1126.48 --> 1138.48]  Okay, here's all the stuff I wanna backup, here's my buddy's CrashPlan code, click, and then it would send over an encrypted version of all of that stuff in like an encrypted container file,
[1138.48 --> 1147.48]  so that in the event that you had some kind of a catastrophic system failure, you would be able to, at the very least, back up all of your precious memories and all that.
[1147.48 --> 1155.48]  And you didn't necessarily even have to trust the person on the other side, you just had to have enough of a working relationship with them,
[1155.48 --> 1166.48]  that you'd be able to get physical access to the data at some point, or even back it up online, if you didn't have so much that it would take weeks to download or whatever the case may be.
[1166.48 --> 1173.48]  So, as long as you, you didn't even have to trust each other, you just had to have like a bilateral agreement that kind of goes,
[1173.48 --> 1174.48]  Yeah.
[1174.48 --> 1179.48]  Hey, I'll have some extra storage in my place, you have some extra storage at your place, we'll back up to each other, boom, done.
[1179.48 --> 1187.48]  And right now, I'm not 100% sure exactly what we're going to switch, or what I'm gonna switch to.
[1187.48 --> 1191.48]  Well, it says it supports small business, so what does that mean? How much does that cost?
[1191.48 --> 1198.48]  I'm using this personally though, and small business is, I believe, I forget, but it's like a significant cost per device.
[1198.48 --> 1199.48]  Okay.
[1199.48 --> 1207.48]  Yeah, so it really is priced like a small business solution. Click to get crash plan for small business, here we go.
[1207.48 --> 1210.48]  So let's have a look at what we got here.
[1210.48 --> 1216.48]  So I'm in a bit of a better spot, because way back now, to be completely honest, I got that Synology NAS.
[1216.48 --> 1217.48]  Yep.
[1217.48 --> 1221.48]  And I can Synology to Synology mirror, which is actually quite nice.
[1221.48 --> 1226.48]  There's other things you can do too on your own, but nothing that's as elegant as this.
[1226.48 --> 1231.48]  And this was like the cross-platform thing, because you could, so I could use it on a Windows desktop,
[1231.48 --> 1235.48]  and I could be backing up to a crash plan Docker container on an Unraid server, for example.
[1235.48 --> 1236.48]  Mm-hmm.
[1236.48 --> 1238.48]  So that was super cool.
[1238.48 --> 1239.48]  But yeah, no, here we go.
[1239.48 --> 1242.48]  It's $10 per device per month.
[1242.48 --> 1243.48]  Wow.
[1243.48 --> 1244.48]  For the business one.
[1244.48 --> 1245.48]  Yeah, so it's $120 a year.
[1245.48 --> 1252.48]  And what kind of sucks about this, it says you can migrate all your cloud backups, something, something.
[1252.48 --> 1259.48]  Yeah, I don't think, yeah, it does not support computer-to-computer backups anymore.
[1259.48 --> 1268.48]  So that super sucks, because that was the whole reason why I would use CrashPlan,
[1268.48 --> 1274.48]  because it's going from thing I own to thing that I own, or is like a thing my friend owns,
[1274.48 --> 1279.48]  instead of relying on, you know, some corporation somewhere to keep all of this stuff safe.
[1279.48 --> 1286.48]  Like, I like the idea of having everything on my servers, and especially not having to pay extra for more cloud storage
[1286.48 --> 1289.48]  if I have a bunch of crap I want to back up.
[1289.48 --> 1297.48]  Like, if I have a gigabit internet connection at my office, I would love to be able to just flood it.
[1297.48 --> 1300.48]  And they're not going to like...
[1300.48 --> 1303.48]  So what happens if you've already got this stuff set up?
[1303.48 --> 1305.48]  Because isn't this local software?
[1305.48 --> 1307.48]  It is local software.
[1307.48 --> 1311.48]  I believe, though, that the...
[1311.48 --> 1312.48]  They can just can it remotely?
[1312.48 --> 1318.48]  Yeah, I believe they can can it, because the way that friends are tracked is through authentication through the software.
[1318.48 --> 1319.48]  Through their thing.
[1319.48 --> 1322.48]  Yeah, so it's not something where you just point it at an IP and it just goes.
[1322.48 --> 1323.48]  Okay.
[1323.48 --> 1326.48]  Yeah, so maybe they've had this in the plan for a long time.
[1326.48 --> 1335.48]  Maybe the people who are smarter than me are going to go find some version that you can kind of roll back to where it all works or something like that.
[1335.48 --> 1340.48]  I'm not sure, but in the meantime, I'm definitely going to be looking for some other kind of solution.
[1340.48 --> 1342.48]  And that's pretty frustrating.
[1342.48 --> 1343.48]  I'm not sure.
[1343.48 --> 1345.48]  I'm just going to be looking for some options.
[1345.48 --> 1346.48]  I can't wait...
[1346.48 --> 1347.48]  I can't wait...
[1347.48 --> 1348.48]  I can't wait...
[1348.48 --> 1349.48]  Just...
[1349.48 --> 1350.48]  I can't wait...
[1350.48 --> 1351.48]  I can't wait...
[1351.48 --> 1352.48]  I can't wait...
[1352.48 --> 1362.04]  Half-Life 3. Oh, you gotta be kidding me. Nope, actually not. So this was originally posted on the forum by N2A Newt and
[1364.66 --> 1370.94]  Let's go ahead and just kind of wow that is so broken. There you go
[1372.28 --> 1374.28]  That looks pretty good
[1374.32 --> 1378.46]  so Half-Life 2 episode 3's story released by
[1378.46 --> 1385.38]  Mark Laidlaw the lead writer for the Half-Life series who left valve last year
[1386.90 --> 1391.60]  Wow, I have a feeling this could get him in a lot of trouble. I
[1392.74 --> 1396.84]  Really hope he's sought out legal counsel. Yeah, I hope he's lawyered up man
[1400.14 --> 1407.46]  Wow, that's pretty crazy if you want to read it's on github and I believe it's in like quite a few other places as well
[1407.46 --> 1412.78]  It's on pastebin because people are worried about it being brought down, which is not surprising at all
[1413.98 --> 1418.38]  Apparently it wraps up a lot of loose ends. It's essentially Half-Life 2 episode 3
[1422.22 --> 1429.68]  Yeah, wow apparently it the corrected versions where it like fixes the genders and fixes a few words that he like
[1429.68 --> 1434.04]  Change that can't be enough to save him at all
[1434.04 --> 1436.00]  But whatever
[1436.00 --> 1440.58]  Um is like a very coherent and plausible plot line
[1440.58 --> 1444.84]  So it's from a fictional character named Gertie Fremont
[1444.84 --> 1448.36]  Yeah, but if you change that yeah
[1448.36 --> 1452.04]  Who recounts her team up with feisty partner Alex Vaunt
[1453.18 --> 1457.50]  To find the hyperborea luxury liner, which must be
[1458.52 --> 1460.52]  Yeah, so
[1461.80 --> 1466.26]  Wow, so he's like probably gonna get owned I really like
[1466.82 --> 1470.70]  So there's no way of knowing whether this was a finalized plot line
[1470.70 --> 1476.88]  We have no way of knowing how far into development Half-Life 2 episode 3 this could be a first draft. Yep
[1476.88 --> 1478.88]  Um
[1478.88 --> 1487.82]  But apparently he was the primary architect of Half-Life's plot and his departure from valve last year was widely seen as acknowledgement that episode 3 was completely dead
[1488.88 --> 1496.48]  So maybe if I can speculate wildly without looking into anything that this guy said publicly at all because you don't have a lot of notes
[1496.48 --> 1500.84]  It's just the WAN show anyway. Yeah, why not right? Let's just yolo it. Yeah
[1500.84 --> 1506.26]  Yeah percent. So yeah fake news warning. Yeah, but I would I would assume that maybe
[1506.26 --> 1512.64]  This is like he's the main architect for the plot. It said that right there. This is probably like his masterpiece
[1513.26 --> 1517.80]  Right, so while he might get screwed for this maybe he just doesn't care. Yeah
[1517.80 --> 1519.80]  Yeah
[1521.80 --> 1529.30]  Cuz like if you created this and like the whole internet is like we want it so bad yeah, and it's like the greatest work you've done
[1529.30 --> 1531.30]  I don't know I don't know what else he's worked on
[1531.30 --> 1534.80]  Yeah, I mean I can see how someone would feel like that like but Half-Life is amazing
[1534.80 --> 1537.30]  So that would be like an amazing thing to be the greatest thing you've done
[1537.30 --> 1541.80]  I'll tell you something like we've considered just going live with the channel super fun
[1541.80 --> 1542.80]  uh top gun
[1542.80 --> 1546.80]  shot for shot volleyball scene recreation and just
[1547.36 --> 1549.36]  Taking the copyright strike
[1549.86 --> 1553.56]  Just so that people can watch it like having it up there for long enough that
[1553.56 --> 1559.06]  That some people can watch it before it gets ripped down cuz like they're not going to delete our channel
[1559.06 --> 1559.56]  No
[1559.56 --> 1566.06]  Realistically, we're not a big enough target to get sued into oblivion by uh, what is it? Columbia pictures?
[1566.06 --> 1568.32]  And if we do what we just give them all the profits from the video?
[1568.32 --> 1570.36]  Can't remember. Well, no, no, they know
[1570.36 --> 1571.36]  There's more to it than that
[1571.36 --> 1572.36]  Yeah, there's more to it than that
[1572.36 --> 1576.96]  Realistically, they're not gonna they're not gonna put a target on their own back
[1576.96 --> 1580.76]  By like trying to shut down
[1580.76 --> 1587.42]  I like to think a fairly, you know beloved youtube creator company like yeah
[1587.42 --> 1592.70]  Like the amount of public backlash over suing us into a crater
[1592.70 --> 1595.82]  Over us just doing a fan
[1595.82 --> 1596.76]  Yeah
[1596.76 --> 1600.20]  Remake of a scene from one of their movies like come on
[1600.20 --> 1604.06]  It seemed it seems very implausible at some people like it at LTX
[1604.06 --> 1608.92]  Yeah, yeah, yeah like at some point before an actual lawsuit occurs
[1608.92 --> 1614.44]  Some human looks at something and makes a decision as to whether or not to proceed with it
[1614.44 --> 1620.92]  And it's not necessarily as simple as the black and white of law. Yeah, it's like is this worth the PR?
[1621.24 --> 1624.60]  Is this worth the cost? Is this worth the effort? Yeah, like that
[1624.60 --> 1629.00]  But like what you just said just to dive further into this topic that I know nothing about
[1629.00 --> 1632.86]  Yeah, um could be a reason why valve might not go for this guy
[1632.86 --> 1642.28]  Valve is the like dream child of all the PC gamers, but remember to and okay less so these days for one thing and
[1642.92 --> 1644.92]  If you don't protect your IP
[1646.28 --> 1651.56]  Then you will be seen as soft and you could open yourself up to this kind of leak
[1651.56 --> 1657.16]  All the time yeah, and all of a sudden valve who might not have a ton of employees
[1657.48 --> 1661.80]  But in terms of revenues mass and profits is a gigantic company
[1663.56 --> 1668.04]  I uh, no, I I think I think they actually have no choice
[1668.84 --> 1671.56]  But to go after him as hardcore as they can
[1673.24 --> 1676.36]  Like if honestly that sucks if I was them I would do it
[1676.36 --> 1684.28]  Just because you can't set a precedent like that and you can't have someone you can't make it okay for that to happen
[1684.84 --> 1689.72]  Because someone might actually come out with a game with gertie fremont and alex avant
[1691.16 --> 1694.68]  Yep, that is like the exact thing like here and call it like
[1695.80 --> 1697.16]  quarter
[1697.16 --> 1698.28]  lifespan
[1698.28 --> 1700.28]  Three let's draw a parallel right?
[1700.28 --> 1704.84]  Right, um, so let's say that um, let's say that you
[1705.80 --> 1708.68]  Decided to quit or something like that. Get owned. Um
[1709.40 --> 1715.24]  Yeah, I know you're like half halfway out the door already, but the point is let's say you decided
[1715.24 --> 1722.20]  Yeah, yeah, like what like three months or something. Yeah, let's say you decided to quit and as the last thing that you did
[1722.84 --> 1725.40]  You went around the office and you grabbed
[1726.44 --> 1728.12]  your scrapyard wars pc
[1728.12 --> 1730.12]  yeah, and
[1730.92 --> 1732.84]  Let's just let's just try and think of like
[1733.72 --> 1738.12]  Some you know what there that's that's I was gonna say the bomb but that's the bomb's kind of yours already anyway
[1738.12 --> 1740.76]  Like I think the plasti dip on it is mine
[1741.32 --> 1747.32]  Yeah, it's not even plastic. Yeah, yes, but the paint belongs to me. Well the plastic you can take the whole middle section
[1747.32 --> 1753.88]  Yeah, the whole middle section. Yeah, yeah, but but let's say the scrapyard wars pc where indisputably linus media group paid for oh, yeah
[1753.88 --> 1756.76]  No, that's yeah, and it was created on work time
[1756.76 --> 1760.20]  Which your employee agreement states that the things you create?
[1760.76 --> 1762.60]  Are the intellectual property of this company?
[1762.60 --> 1763.72]  Yeah, no, that's that's works
[1763.72 --> 1767.16]  Which i'm sure he has a very similar agreement in place certain
[1767.32 --> 1771.72]  So let's say that you took off with it and you were like i'm not giving this bag
[1772.52 --> 1779.00]  I would have no choice even though I don't actually care and as far as i'm concerned you can have it because that would be
[1779.40 --> 1783.96]  I didn't give you permission. Yeah, you just took couldn't that then be used
[1784.92 --> 1789.72]  Against you if someone else does it possibly yes because you set a precedent that this is okay
[1789.96 --> 1794.44]  Yes, and that could be seen as like a benefit of working here or something or something
[1794.76 --> 1801.00]  Either way i'm creating the potential for this to come back and become a problem and honestly in this case
[1801.00 --> 1806.68]  The stakes are even so much lower than someone you know leaking the plot of an oh, yeah
[1806.68 --> 1809.80]  Oh, yeah, definitely that's that's taking some property
[1810.84 --> 1817.08]  And like displaying it in my house probably yeah, the other thing would be taking property and giving it to everyone
[1817.32 --> 1821.16]  That's right. That would be like taking a video that we never released that I made
[1821.64 --> 1825.16]  Yeah, and giving it to everyone on my own channels later. Yep
[1826.20 --> 1829.08]  Where even if you had no intention of profiting from it
[1829.32 --> 1833.40]  This is something that a lot of people don't necessarily understand is the definition of profit
[1833.40 --> 1842.60]  Does not necessarily come down to the money that luke makes like let's say that luke took it and did a stream on his twitch channel
[1843.08 --> 1845.96]  Where he specifically the nda expired
[1850.20 --> 1853.40]  So is the argument here that the statute of limitations is up
[1854.44 --> 1861.16]  Because it's been a year or something like that well his nda yeah his nda from working there has apparently so there's a difference between
[1861.16 --> 1868.92]  That's very yeah, and nda and intellectual property yeah, and stealing it and disclosing something that's under if he was like
[1868.92 --> 1872.68]  Yeah, if he was like I had a fully written script
[1873.80 --> 1874.68]  for
[1874.68 --> 1876.68]  Half-life 2 episode 3
[1876.68 --> 1883.64]  That would be a perfect example of something that would be nda but not intellectual property
[1884.68 --> 1888.28]  um, so anyway, so back like literally the script back to the example
[1888.28 --> 1896.04]  Let's say luke decided that for that stream all the money that came in was going to go to a charity or he was going to turn off monetization
[1896.04 --> 1899.96]  Um for the video where he displayed that video. Yeah, um
[1900.52 --> 1903.08]  He still profits in the sense that
[1903.80 --> 1909.32]  If even if I can prove that even a single person went and watched that stream who wouldn't have otherwise
[1910.20 --> 1912.20]  He profited
[1912.20 --> 1913.80]  off of
[1913.80 --> 1919.56]  The thing that didn't belong to him that he stole from linus media group in the sense that he gained notoriety
[1920.04 --> 1924.28]  He was saying get john. I didn't uh, yeah, we could go get john actually
[1924.92 --> 1929.96]  Uh, he's uh, he's upstairs. We can you know what why don't we come back to this topic a little bit
[1930.52 --> 1934.76]  A little bit later in the stream. I want to say two things before we get john here so that like everyone remembers
[1934.76 --> 1938.20]  We can bring this up one some people are comparing this to h3h3
[1938.20 --> 1944.76]  That's not it at all. No, it's not content that was released by someone else that was used in minor form for parody completely
[1945.32 --> 1947.32]  drastically different situation
[1947.32 --> 1948.44]  um and
[1948.44 --> 1954.60]  Another one this would be sort of comparable to someone working at like dreamworks
[1955.48 --> 1960.60]  And they make a bunch of like internal animations and different shorts and all this different kind of stuff that they don't get to completion
[1960.92 --> 1964.84]  And then they quit and then a year later. They just release all of these publicly. Yeah, that's
[1964.84 --> 1968.68]  It's we'll get john here, but i'm like pretty john will be down
[1968.84 --> 1971.40]  I feel pretty good about the position that i've taken on it
[1971.40 --> 1973.88]  But hey, he could always come in and tell me i'm wrong in the meantime
[1974.28 --> 1977.88]  Uh, why don't we do our so america so the laws are like slightly different?
[1978.20 --> 1980.60]  Uh, what do we got for how wow you know?
[1980.60 --> 1983.48]  What's funny is we actually thought we didn't have a lot of topics this week
[1983.48 --> 1988.28]  But we've got a fair bit that we still have a fair bit to talk about so let's uh, let's get through this
[1988.28 --> 1991.24]  Are you a uh, wait what?
[1992.28 --> 1994.28]  We can do that one. We'll get back to it
[1994.28 --> 1995.24]  Okay, fresh books
[1995.24 --> 1997.72]  So if you're a small business owner or a freelancer

[2005.48 --> 2009.96]  You do small-time computer repair or it work for local offices, whatever it is you do
[2010.44 --> 2017.32]  Fresh books is all about giving you the tools to make your organization your billing and your accounting
[2017.80 --> 2023.88]  Way simpler and expenses which is the thing that a lot of new businesses don't take proper advantage of tracking expenses
[2023.88 --> 2053.88] 
[2053.88 --> 2054.84]  All that stuff
[2054.84 --> 2059.72]  And if you have any questions, they're there to help you pick up the phone you call fresh books
[2059.72 --> 2062.12]  A human picks up the line and helps you out with it
[2062.12 --> 2063.16]  fresh books
[2063.16 --> 2070.12]  Is one of the only sponsors that we've ever worked with where I have never seen a complaint?
[2070.12 --> 2074.44]  Yeah, that was not resolved in a timely manner by fresh books
[2075.00 --> 2079.40]  These guys are freaking awesome and if you're a small business owner and you want to simplify your accounting
[2079.40 --> 2084.84]  Go check them out at freshbooks.com slash when and enter when in the how did you hear about us section
[2084.84 --> 2089.64]  In other news our savage jerky offer has changed
[2091.16 --> 2094.52]  Do we have one in here so savage jerky super delicious?
[2095.40 --> 2101.56]  Um, i'm gonna grab the uh, you know what i'm gonna i'm just not i'm just not gonna do the spicy today
[2101.56 --> 2103.08]  I think we'll chill out today
[2103.08 --> 2107.00]  I'm just i'm gonna keep i'm gonna take it easy the cracked pepper and sea salt is delicious
[2107.48 --> 2112.76]  I love the uh, you're gonna go for sweet sriracha barbecue. What's that green one that I really like moho?
[2113.48 --> 2115.80]  Um, yeah moho moho is it just moho?
[2115.80 --> 2123.48]  Yeah, yeah, that one's freaking delicious. Uh, the maple bacon one's really good. Traditional's very good. Uh, traditional's really good. They've got lots of great flavors
[2123.96 --> 2125.16]  Um
[2125.16 --> 2128.20]  Jerky's made with the best ingredients without nitrates or preservatives
[2128.60 --> 2133.16]  And they wanted to create a snap that was full of flavor and spice without being bad for you

[2172.76 --> 2177.48]  John get in here. You can take my spot. We're talking about the uh, the half-life three plot
[2177.48 --> 2179.72]  We can just we can just make a space in the middle. Have you heard about this?
[2179.72 --> 2183.24]  I have not heard about this. I've seen this have you heard about this? Okay. Okay, why don't you actually look at it?
[2183.24 --> 2185.88]  Will we do one one more topic and then you can come back and talk to us about it? Use my laptop
[2185.88 --> 2187.88]  What are we looking at again? Use my laptop. Yeah, okay
[2188.60 --> 2191.88]  In the meantime, I want to jump into one of our other topics here
[2191.88 --> 2192.68]  Right in the middle of the screen
[2193.32 --> 2195.32]  Someone messed with me
[2195.80 --> 2199.40]  Someone put a spicy one in the cracked pepper and sea salt
[2199.40 --> 2205.56]  I was delicious as usual, but I have the hiccups now because I wasn't expecting it
[2207.48 --> 2209.72]  That wasn't me that actually wasn't me
[2210.92 --> 2213.32]  I wouldn't be surprised if it was Ivan. Jackasses
[2214.04 --> 2216.04]  Jackasses everywhere
[2216.04 --> 2217.00]  What's his plan?
[2217.00 --> 2218.12]  His plan was to like
[2219.16 --> 2222.44]  Have a whole bunch in a line. You don't know which one's the spicy one, and it's like roulette
[2223.24 --> 2224.52]  Oh lordy
[2224.52 --> 2227.72]  We should do that as a channel super fun. No, we kind of a fun channel super beef jerky roulette
[2227.72 --> 2229.72]  All right
[2230.04 --> 2232.12]  This was originally posted over on Ars Technica
[2235.32 --> 2237.00]  And Intel's not really hiding it
[2237.80 --> 2241.40]  But they recently launched eighth generation mobile chips
[2242.36 --> 2242.84]  and the
[2243.48 --> 2247.88]  um, the assumption I think from a lot of people even fairly tech savvy people I assumed this
[2248.44 --> 2251.08]  the assumption was that an eighth generation mobile chip
[2252.04 --> 2255.24]  would be coffee lake which is their upcoming architecture
[2256.44 --> 2256.76]  nope
[2257.72 --> 2259.72]  these quad core
[2259.72 --> 2260.04]  Dang it
[2261.24 --> 2266.68]  these quad core u-class mobile chips which by the by the way is pretty freaking sick
[2267.72 --> 2271.48]  so base clocks of anywhere from 1.6 to 1.9 gigahertz
[2272.76 --> 2277.32]  and boost clocks of 3.4 to 3.9 gigahertz at four core
[2277.32 --> 2278.28]  cores
[2278.28 --> 2279.64]  with
[2279.64 --> 2284.28]  and these are all 15 watt parts
[2285.00 --> 2291.00]  are pretty darn impressive and are going to enable a completely new class of mobile device
[2291.56 --> 2295.08]  like i'm really looking forward to see if lg does a 2018 gram
[2295.08 --> 2297.08]  with these processors
[2297.08 --> 2297.40]  right
[2297.40 --> 2297.64]  yeah
[2297.64 --> 2300.52]  or something like it because a quad core
[2300.52 --> 2305.88]  it's really the only thing i'm missing you've already got an nvme ssd you've already got 16 gigs plus of ram
[2306.36 --> 2309.40]  so the one thing missing is more multi-threading performance and
[2309.40 --> 2313.64]  they're even hyper threaded so we're talking four cores eight threads
[2313.64 --> 2315.72]  and they're just gonna be able to do that
[2315.72 --> 2317.72]  these things look sick
[2317.72 --> 2318.36]  unfortunately
[2318.92 --> 2321.80]  this is not nearly the shift that we were possibly
[2322.44 --> 2323.16]  expecting
[2323.16 --> 2325.16]  they are built on a somewhat refined version
[2325.64 --> 2328.20]  of intel's 14 nanometer manufacturing process
[2328.20 --> 2329.96]  and even though they're calling them eighth gen
[2330.76 --> 2332.60]  they're actually much more similar
[2333.16 --> 2338.76]  both cpu and gpu to the seventh generation kaby lake so they're calling these kaby lake refresh
[2339.40 --> 2342.20]  which if my experience is anything to go on basically means
[2342.92 --> 2343.48]  kaby lake
[2343.48 --> 2343.96]  yeah
[2345.08 --> 2346.36]  and it's frustrating because
[2347.48 --> 2348.60]  the whole idea
[2349.16 --> 2351.88]  behind like with like a better understanding of their bidding
[2351.88 --> 2352.12]  yeah
[2352.92 --> 2356.20]  the whole idea and it will intel is iterating all the time
[2356.20 --> 2358.60]  so it's kaby lake refresh
[2359.32 --> 2363.96]  but they're probably already using all the things they learned in other kaby lake chips as it is
[2364.84 --> 2366.60]  because they are making changes over time
[2366.60 --> 2366.92]  fair
[2366.92 --> 2369.64]  um sorry john we're almost ready for you sorry um
[2370.68 --> 2374.92]  but it's frustrating because the whole idea behind this gen thing is you're supposed to be able to understand
[2375.56 --> 2382.52]  what generation the freaking thing is architecturally and now we've got seventh generation processors
[2382.52 --> 2387.48]  processors on the hedt side that are sky lake based
[2388.20 --> 2392.52]  we've got seventh generation processors on the mainstream side that are kaby lake based
[2393.08 --> 2396.04]  and then we've got eighth generation processors that are kaby lake based
[2396.36 --> 2397.72]  is nothing sacred
[2397.72 --> 2398.60]  no
[2402.68 --> 2403.96]  so um yeah
[2407.24 --> 2411.08]  oh but to be clear the hedt ones i'm talking about are like the 7900x
[2411.72 --> 2417.32]  so that because it has a seven it's seventh gen but it is actually a sixth generation sky lake architecture
[2417.32 --> 2422.12]  so now there's going to have to be like the intel version and there's going to have to be like the
[2422.12 --> 2426.44]  enthusiast who has who's keeping track of this on their own version of what gen everything is
[2426.44 --> 2429.72]  all right so let's feel like we're going to need another tech wiki video
[2429.72 --> 2434.76]  let's let john jump in and talk about this whole half-life three thing i'll give you my spot
[2441.08 --> 2447.88]  here we go okay so half-life three how does how does this work because we think
[2448.52 --> 2453.32]  linus and i are both in agreement right now that some people in the chat are saying like oh
[2453.32 --> 2462.76]  he's nda lifted but we don't think this is an nda thing in our opinion it would be covered under nda if he was just like
[2463.48 --> 2473.32]  i had completed a script for half-life uh two episode three and that's all he says that seems like an nda style
[2473.32 --> 2478.44]  thing him actually releasing all the content does not seem like an nda protected action
[2478.44 --> 2487.72]  i mean nda is going to be written pretty broadly though yeah you can you can write an nda so what
[2487.72 --> 2492.84]  right but what we're saying is like um people are saying that the nda has lifted because he hasn't
[2492.84 --> 2500.60]  worked there for a year so he's released this content not being a employee of valve anymore
[2500.60 --> 2506.76]  mm-hmm and people are saying that he's fine because the nda lifted does that make any sense uh
[2508.60 --> 2515.80]  it does okay sorry if i seem a little bit confused you seem very confused well no it's it's more that
[2515.80 --> 2521.72]  um i don't i can't really think of a reason why that wouldn't make sense honestly okay you can
[2521.72 --> 2527.64]  have so if i work at linus sick tips and we make a series of videos called scrapyard wars
[2527.64 --> 2532.20]  and we make scrapyard wars hypothetical here we make scrapyard wars episode seven
[2533.08 --> 2539.32]  and ed finishes editing them but then linus hates me so fires me and doesn't want to release the
[2539.32 --> 2542.68]  episodes anymore because it wants nothing to do with me and i have all the copies of the episodes
[2542.68 --> 2549.48]  and i release them somewhere else because my nda expired how does that make any sense uh well you're
[2549.48 --> 2556.84]  covering different things with an nda versus just a separate agreement saying that you don't own
[2556.84 --> 2563.32]  copyright in it but this is this is content like did you actually see the post i read the bullet
[2563.32 --> 2569.00]  points below it not yeah no this is what he released okay which is like the script so he like changed
[2569.00 --> 2574.36]  that well it's like it's a letter from one character to another and the names and places have been changed
[2574.36 --> 2580.84]  but it's extremely obvious but like gordon freeman is uh what uh gerda something
[2580.84 --> 2587.32]  dirty freeman yeah or frement or something
[2589.40 --> 2593.72]  so wouldn't the storyline be considered ip and wouldn't that be covered separately from
[2596.92 --> 2603.96]  an nda you could cover it under both okay there's no i don't see a reason you couldn't do that so
[2603.96 --> 2614.44]  so do you think it's possible that he's off the hook here is he in trouble with valve is valve no
[2614.44 --> 2620.20]  one knows no one knows yet we're trying to figure out if he's in trouble with valve yeah i feel like
[2620.20 --> 2624.12]  valve wouldn't construct their nda in a way that makes it so that you can just release whatever you
[2624.12 --> 2629.88]  worked on after you leave for a year i don't know why anyone would ever do that that makes no sense
[2629.88 --> 2636.60]  it could be but like i was saying you could it could be under it could be covered under something
[2636.60 --> 2641.00]  else that isn't an nda so even if they say even if they structure something that says right but we're
[2641.00 --> 2649.32]  talking about if it's not covered not if it is covered uh okay so you're you're asking me if this
[2650.12 --> 2657.48]  isn't covered by an nda yeah i'm not asking you if it's covered by other things because we don't know
[2657.48 --> 2661.32]  we don't know there's no information about that at all all we know we're speculating what the
[2661.32 --> 2671.88]  likelihood is that he's okay here based on what based on because you're asking that he revealed
[2671.88 --> 2678.44]  the plot line of something that he was working on at valve and is therefore the intellectual property
[2678.44 --> 2692.12]  of valve after leaving i mean i have no way to say like it it completely depends on like how much valve
[2692.12 --> 2698.04]  values this information so and who knows if they do or not you know or they you know were they actually
[2698.04 --> 2706.76]  planning to release a sequel or not so interesting okay i had thought uh i had thought it'd be a little
[2706.76 --> 2710.52]  more open shut than that like well we're making some assumptions we're making assumptions that
[2711.08 --> 2717.48]  valve is going to aggressively protect its intellectual property regardless of whether it mattered or not
[2718.36 --> 2722.84]  because it sets kind of a bad precedent if they just let people walk away with this stuff well i mean
[2723.96 --> 2729.88]  you're right in that it probably would be considered ip like you're you're you are probably right about
[2729.88 --> 2735.96]  that but like at the same time is if you're going to sit here and ask oh how much trouble is he possibly
[2735.96 --> 2742.04]  in yeah impossible to say it really depends on what valve wants to do okay yeah all right thank you yep
[2744.44 --> 2749.16]  so so it sounds like we weren't that far off we were just making kind of a different set of
[2749.16 --> 2753.56]  assumptions about how we think valve would behave yeah that may or may not be right
[2754.76 --> 2760.44]  so we're just gonna have to wait and see how this one shakes out according to apparently um he has
[2760.44 --> 2768.44]  released a tweet i don't know where it went i lost the click sure why don't you have a look while i uh
[2768.44 --> 2775.00]  jump in and talk about the vega shortage okay so this was originally posted over on videocards.com
[2775.56 --> 2780.04]  um and actually there's a post by coaxial gamer over on the forum and the original article there is from
[2780.04 --> 2789.40]  pcgamesn.com but apparently the vega shortage could last until october in spite of amd's efforts to keep rx vega
[2789.40 --> 2799.24]  prices low so uh this is from video cards according to well informed sources of digitimes you should not
[2799.24 --> 2805.88]  expect to find rx vega in stores at least at a normal price until october while amd promised to
[2805.88 --> 2810.84]  prepare a high to prepare a high volume of rx vega graphics cards for launch the reality was that many
[2810.84 --> 2818.36]  countries apparently did not receive a single unit of the new flagship card the problem allegedly lies in
[2818.36 --> 2823.24]  the complexity of the vega chips other sources claim that this issue may lie in advanced semiconductor
[2823.24 --> 2828.84]  engineering packaging technology if i had to guess and this would be pure speculation i would say it
[2828.84 --> 2837.80]  probably has a lot to do with hbm2 and maybe not necessarily even the amount of hbm2 that amd can buy
[2838.36 --> 2847.24]  but possibly as much as that to do with amd simply not wanting to buy that much hbm2 right now
[2848.20 --> 2853.72]  because right now they're one of the only ones using it so if they put in a massive order they
[2853.72 --> 2858.84]  would themselves inherently spike the pricing of something that is a very limited commodity and
[2858.84 --> 2863.96]  that just you can i mean anyone can look at this on dram exchange something that went up drastically in
[2863.96 --> 2871.72]  price in the couple of weeks before rx vega's official launch so if i was amd i would be probably
[2871.72 --> 2876.84]  trying to ride it out until another competitor starts building hbm2 which is supposedly going
[2876.84 --> 2883.08]  to happen fairly soon and i would be um yeah like i wouldn't be going out of my way to produce a bunch
[2883.08 --> 2890.36]  of cards that i'm maybe not even making money on i'm just i'm speculating though yeah that's fair
[2890.92 --> 2896.68]  uh one thing i want to add i found i found the tweet he tweeted saying my website's down for now i guess a
[2896.68 --> 2902.84]  fanfic is popular even a gender swapped snapshot snapshot of a dream i had many years ago
[2904.84 --> 2910.52]  so is that him backpedaling on i don't even know how overt he wants to be
[2910.52 --> 2915.96]  about this forward pedal at all or did the internet just freak out maybe i don't know that could be a
[2915.96 --> 2924.20]  case i kind of think it's probably fairly not a big deal and i'm gonna make another wild assumption
[2924.20 --> 2930.52]  based on no information um because fake news is really fun man show man um but my idea here is that
[2930.52 --> 2934.84]  it's on his own website his pinned tweet is him trying to sell books that he's written he's trying
[2934.84 --> 2939.40]  to sell books that he's written an easy way to get a whole bunch of traffic to his website which did happen
[2939.40 --> 2946.04]  and to get more interest around him and his books is so if it had on the thing that he if it legitimately
[2946.04 --> 2952.92]  had nothing to do with any kind of planet valve then i think it's fine because i believe fanfic is
[2952.92 --> 2958.28]  like okay i think you're allowed to do that and letting the internet go full conspiracy theory
[2959.72 --> 2964.92]  is a great marketing tactic i don't know how long interesting took until he clarified it right
[2964.92 --> 2973.48]  i like your new theory i like that one the most um okay in other news uh this was from pcgames and
[2973.48 --> 2979.88]  dot com amd says they're trying to keep prices of rx vega low though so after the prices inflated after
[2979.88 --> 2985.56]  launch amd now says it's trying its best to get those prices to where we suggested when we launched them
[2986.44 --> 2992.12]  so they're amd's uh gerald youngblood says our sep so that's suggested prices and the price tag that we
[2992.12 --> 2995.64]  announced is our full intention of where we would suggest the product be priced not just for launch
[2995.64 --> 2999.80]  but ongoing they said the price surge due to overwhelming demand and that the filling of
[2999.80 --> 3004.28]  retailers inventory is key to getting the prices of vega down to their original pre-launch levels
[3005.00 --> 3013.64]  um yeah that makes sense uh but again so we're looking at amd having to um having to put pressure
[3013.64 --> 3019.56]  on retailers which a lot of the time manifests as like a rebate or something and you know that whole
[3019.56 --> 3025.00]  thing broke a little while ago we expressed our frustration with it yeah yeah again this is more
[3025.00 --> 3034.12]  evidence for amd not really having um much motivation to provide as much vega as they possibly can right
[3034.12 --> 3044.44]  now yeah because here's what you guys need to understand amd does not profit from the mining craze
[3044.44 --> 3052.12]  and from the prices being jacked up 200 on the shelf the retailer and or the opportunistic
[3052.76 --> 3057.48]  reseller who runs out to a store whenever they find it at regular price and then flips it on ebay they
[3057.48 --> 3063.08]  profit amd doesn't want that because they're effectively creating a bunch of hate in their
[3063.08 --> 3068.20]  community and a bunch of anger and they don't even get to make more money out of it yeah so you
[3068.20 --> 3074.36]  you shouldn't really think about this emotionally you have to think about it rationally it's it's not
[3074.36 --> 3079.40]  in amd's best interest unless they are actually raising the price of the product which is going
[3079.40 --> 3088.52]  to piss everyone off to have the street price be high yeah um so you know i've talked to them um i can't
[3088.52 --> 3094.28]  share everything that was shared with me but i'll say benefit of the doubt um i still and you can go back
[3094.28 --> 3098.04]  and watch last week's wanshow if you want to know what i'm upset about i'm still upset about pretty much all of
[3098.04 --> 3103.96]  it amd could have done a way better job of communicating the way that they were handling
[3103.96 --> 3108.84]  this launch pricing because if they had told me that it was going to be through rebates
[3109.40 --> 3113.80]  i would have known that the entire thing was going to be a cluster and this is okay so this is a
[3113.80 --> 3118.52]  situation where like i've never been on the other end so i don't know there's unknown variables here
[3118.52 --> 3125.08]  but sometimes the communication stuff that happens directed towards us from a wide variety of
[3125.08 --> 3131.48]  companies i'm not even going to narrow down to amd right now yeah is just very not good yeah and it
[3131.48 --> 3141.24]  doesn't seem that hard well it seems hard when you make things hard on yourself so a lot of the
[3141.24 --> 3146.20]  miscommunication around vega had to do with that they originally were going to just lift the embargo on
[3146.20 --> 3151.32]  vega 64 the flagship card and then at the last second decided to lift the embargo on 56.
[3151.32 --> 3158.20]  don't do that right but think about it this way it's not the people who are actually in the trenches
[3158.20 --> 3163.56]  with nvidia card in their right hand and upcoming amd card in their left hand testing them against each
[3163.56 --> 3167.96]  other who like actually know how this whole thing is going to shake down and how the press is going to
[3167.96 --> 3173.72]  react to it it's not those people making the decision unfortunately it's probably some executive
[3173.72 --> 3179.88]  making the decision and then ultimately and i told you so moment that takes place once the hardware is
[3179.88 --> 3184.68]  already in the hands of the reviewers and they get some initial feedback that hey this isn't going
[3184.68 --> 3192.28]  to be a super positive review because hey vega 64 is not crazy competitive like it's it's not a game
[3192.28 --> 3201.96]  changer guys um so some some executive who's in la la land probably got that feedback and was like okay
[3201.96 --> 3207.32]  fine let's do it your way let's launch the one that actually makes sense vega 56 at the same time so we
[3207.32 --> 3211.56]  don't end up with a bunch of negative press to lose our momentum that's probably how it went down
[3211.56 --> 3216.76]  and i'm speculating i told you guys i had a call with amd that was definitely not confirmed or talked
[3216.76 --> 3222.84]  about but that's what i would guess went on um and that's how these things keep happening because it was
[3222.84 --> 3228.20]  the same bloody thing with ryzen 7. originally they were going to roll out the skis two weeks apart
[3228.20 --> 3232.52]  and then the last second they're like oh no we're lifting the embargo on all of them and only a handful of
[3232.52 --> 3237.32]  press actually got them all because they couldn't get them to us in time someone in the chat was like
[3237.32 --> 3241.08]  okay i don't i don't know where the message is so i'm gonna verbatim this and i'm gonna get a little
[3241.08 --> 3247.16]  bit of it wrong sorry but someone in the chat said something along the lines of um yeah but you were just
[3247.16 --> 3251.32]  blinded by wanting the profits of releasing the video on launch day
[3253.80 --> 3258.52]  i don't think that's valid personally i wasn't a part of the video creation process for that
[3258.52 --> 3265.24]  but from my view i don't think it's being blinded when to be able to see that you would have had to
[3265.24 --> 3270.04]  make extremely wild drastic assumptions that wouldn't have made any sense in the moment
[3271.08 --> 3276.20]  um yeah and it has that would have been very a very weird thing to assume here's the thing is i
[3276.20 --> 3282.92]  think people underestimate how much profit there is in having a video up um a day or two earlier for
[3282.92 --> 3287.56]  us the main issue from what i heard yeah and like again the reason why i keep on putting this in is
[3287.56 --> 3292.52]  because i'm actually outside of the circle but the main issue that i heard was that we had a
[3292.52 --> 3297.64]  completed video yeah we did that would have been a problem if we released yeah because now there was
[3297.64 --> 3303.72]  new information so we were correcting a problem we were we were completely done our vega 64 launch
[3303.72 --> 3309.64]  video with the air cooled and the liquid cooled card someone says ldt is totally sellout we do sponsor
[3309.64 --> 3316.04]  spots yeah we do ads we work with companies but we are very transparent when we do so yeah and that has
[3316.04 --> 3320.60]  not wanting to repeat work that you've done because someone else made a terrible last minute decision
[3320.60 --> 3326.84]  that screws you over i think it's a perfectly reasonable stance yeah and as for getting content
[3326.84 --> 3333.72]  out on launch day honestly we don't make a bunch more money for doing that um a youtube view is not
[3333.72 --> 3338.60]  worth nearly as much as you might think in terms of monetary value so yeah we'll get a few more views
[3338.60 --> 3346.12]  but for me it's more about making sure that we are perceived as a place that you go when you go and
[3346.12 --> 3353.72]  get like graphics card news about a new card that launches and if you know let's say let's say we
[3353.72 --> 3359.16]  weren't able to bring people in on the weekend if our video goes up and it's just vega 64 and everyone
[3359.16 --> 3364.20]  else's video or written review goes up and it's vega 56 and vega 64 it makes us look stupid
[3365.08 --> 3369.64]  and we don't want that and we shouldn't have to work through the weekend in order to do that
[3369.64 --> 3374.20]  companies should be respectful of our time and our schedules and the fact that we have lives and kids
[3374.20 --> 3381.48]  and other things we have to deal with um that's the issue what about likes are they worth more profit no
[3381.48 --> 3389.80]  likes are worth nothing exactly zero um some guy said luke likes negative comments uh they can be helpful
[3389.80 --> 3395.32]  because if someone's thinking those things genuinely it's good to address it and uh help
[3395.32 --> 3400.44]  them understand that they're wrong absolutely um okay this was posted originally on the forum by
[3401.32 --> 3405.08]  james had like an hour to throw together the doc today so i don't blame him for it not being there
[3405.08 --> 3409.72]  numlock 21 yeah no and the original article here is from tom's hardware amd has gone into a little
[3409.72 --> 3417.40]  bit more detail about their epic and thread ripper chip designs uh claiming a 41 cost reduction which
[3417.40 --> 3422.12]  would actually account for the difference in price between amd's 16 core chip and intel's yeah
[3423.08 --> 3431.16]  which is pretty cool so they decided to go with um like this modular design versus a monolithic design
[3431.16 --> 3437.72]  because even though the modular design because of the interconnects is 10 percent higher in costs so 10
[3437.72 --> 3445.00]  percent more dye space apparently it saves so many failures allowing them to all right save so many
[3445.00 --> 3451.32]  failures that they can just take higher yield ones and quote-unquote glue them together that they
[3451.32 --> 3457.80]  actually reduce their cost by they estimate 41 that's pretty freaking cool that is actually very
[3457.80 --> 3463.08]  cool and that's very good for them specifically yeah to be honest and good for the consumer need to be
[3463.08 --> 3468.76]  making money so that they can actually keep doing things they like super do uh amazon has made its
[3468.76 --> 3476.84]  first big move with whole foods the original article here is from bloomberg um i was on prime members
[3476.84 --> 3485.72]  to get discounts at whole foods so you can pay just a uh less inflated price for groceries and paper
[3485.72 --> 3491.96]  bags instead of plastic bags because you're a giant hipster not that i'm judging i've shopped at whole foods
[3491.96 --> 3498.44]  um they also plan to make prime the customer rewards program at whole foods and products from
[3498.44 --> 3503.32]  whole foods private label 365 will be available on amazon they have not yet indicated a time frame
[3503.32 --> 3506.84]  for all these changes i technically have never shopped there but i've shopped at the like
[3508.60 --> 3516.52]  the like langley alternative oh okay yeah it's um it's it's so it's so funny it's uh smells like health
[3516.52 --> 3522.44]  food the structure of it is very much like a um like a chain clothing store like a hollister i think
[3522.44 --> 3526.76]  is the one that always smells like cedar wood is it hollister i don't i don't i don't know which
[3526.76 --> 3531.64]  clothing stores but um you know how you walk into the last time i was in a mall and they like feel
[3531.64 --> 3537.80]  really unique and then you go to another one of the same store somewhere else and it's exactly the
[3537.80 --> 3545.72]  same flavor of totally unique where it's this very um contrived yeah uh you know we do this totally
[3545.72 --> 3550.76]  differently than everybody else so uh yeah no i shopped at whole foods i think i've been there
[3550.76 --> 3555.80]  twice okay once because it was the only thing within walking distance of my hotel yeah and another
[3555.80 --> 3563.64]  time because i really needed an ice cream bar and i bought the only like with fat with dairy with
[3563.64 --> 3568.12]  gluten ice cream bar in the whole store actually no i think it was gluten-free by the way if you're in
[3568.12 --> 3574.68]  vancouver i believe this weekend or maybe only for one specific day but look it up uber is like coming
[3574.68 --> 3581.72]  here now to vancouver finally and i believe they're showing up by doing free ice cream bar deliveries
[3582.28 --> 3587.08]  oh but i think it's only in vancouver sick i don't think they're doing all uber all the way out here if
[3587.08 --> 3592.36]  they are doing uber all the way out here i am getting my free ice cream bar actually even if not
[3592.36 --> 3597.00]  i might just like go down there to get a free ice cream bar because i'm going down there on saturday
[3597.00 --> 3603.56]  anyways what else do we have uh this is from bloomberg uh apple reported to unveil a new apple tv that'll be
[3603.56 --> 3612.04]  faster 4k hdr video blippity bloppity pixel 2 is coming october 5th rumor rumor rumor originally
[3612.04 --> 3621.80]  posted by techcrunch and um yep it looks like a phone it looks like a phone it looks like a pixel
[3622.68 --> 3629.24]  it has a thing here that's kind of pixely yeah the bezels are smaller a lot smaller yeah way smaller
[3629.24 --> 3637.00]  snapdragon 836 uh it could have front facing speakers i love that note that's my favorite note
[3637.00 --> 3643.96]  from today apparently a two to one aspect ratio okay i know that mathematically there's no reason
[3644.52 --> 3653.24]  to call um oh what is it yeah to call 16 by 10 16 by 10 right you could just as easily call it 8 by 5
[3653.24 --> 3660.44]  yeah but for the sake of making life a little easier i kind of wish everyone would go like by 9
[3661.24 --> 3669.64]  since we all know what 16 by 9 is yeah but the what is a two to one aspect ratio so that would be
[3669.64 --> 3674.92]  18 by 9 i guess yeah 18 by 9 but the fact that i have to convert it all the time
[3674.92 --> 3679.16]  it's gonna drive me crazy to be fair this probably affects almost no one but you
[3679.16 --> 3684.60]  so there's some rumors but i do understand where you're coming from uh 4.97 inch 1080p display for
[3684.60 --> 3691.16]  the smaller one with a uh six inch on the larger xl apparently it'll be provided by lg it'll support uh
[3691.16 --> 3697.96]  it'll sport four gigs of ram on board internal storage might get boosted to 64 gigs and uh it's probably got
[3697.96 --> 3705.40]  a great camera it might there's a lot of like it could it might yeah uh there's a it might drop the
[3705.40 --> 3711.40]  headphone port but like might have front-facing speakers it might have squeezable sides it might
[3711.40 --> 3719.48]  have bluetooth well it might be able to connect to the internet okay we don't know maybe they're
[3719.48 --> 3727.88]  going with the uh world's first modern smartphone without the internet wi-fi hotspot only i think we're
[3727.88 --> 3732.04]  probably done with this week and thank you for watching the show we will see you again next week
[3732.04 --> 3737.24]  same bad time same bad channel oh spacex photos of the new spacesuit are actually super cool have
[3737.24 --> 3742.68]  you seen these fine you can do that i know i'm a fanboy but like they're pretty neat um all right fine
[3742.68 --> 3747.32]  we'll look at the new space wait these aren't the ones that i saw these aren't as cool oh they're still
[3747.32 --> 3754.20]  pretty cool those don't look that amazing no where's the cool ones those are just spacesuits where's the
[3754.20 --> 3760.68]  cool ones yeah i think you're just i think you're done i think that's the wrong article that is the wrong
[3760.68 --> 3766.04]  article okay here's the right article dang it james for throwing this together in an hour and screwing
[3766.04 --> 3773.08]  up one thing so far it also doesn't have the other photo whatever let's talk about floatplane stuff yeah
[3773.08 --> 3780.36]  floatplane not dead not dead definitely not dead doing great actually had a meeting today people were
[3780.36 --> 3786.92]  cool thanks for showing up guys that work on floatplane uh outdoor gaming the ultimate camping battle
[3786.92 --> 3790.60]  station i think we need a new thumbnail for this one that makes it more clear that we are in the
[3790.60 --> 3797.48]  middle of a forest gaming on like a freaking awesome gaming pc um let's see mezzanine update i forgot to
[3797.48 --> 3802.84]  upload that i did at the last minute there this is a really cool video i think a lot of you will like it
[3803.88 --> 3810.20]  we designed the ultimate gaming tv have you seen this have you heard about this no so um alex and i worked
[3810.20 --> 3818.04]  on this together and we basically conceptualized what uh what a perfect tv for gamers would be
[3819.16 --> 3824.04]  and this is just a couple of we've probably got somewhere between six and ten features
[3824.68 --> 3830.20]  that tv makers for whatever reason have their heads too far up their rectums i think i heard about one of
[3830.20 --> 3836.20]  the features okay so one of them was an integrated um what's that stupid thing called that you have that
[3836.20 --> 3843.40]  um uh analog to digital converter whoa what's that thing called again frame meister the frame meister
[3843.40 --> 3849.88]  so is it actually a frame meister so think about it think about this it doesn't have to be no as long
[3849.88 --> 3855.48]  as it was something quite similar so the frame meister actually here we're no okay we got frame meister
[3855.48 --> 3861.48]  probably like a little too overkill for most yes so it costs about 400 for a frame meister which is this
[3861.48 --> 3867.40]  external box that takes your analog source like a super nintendo or playstation one and converts it to
[3867.40 --> 3875.24]  hdmi with next to no latency because as you may or may not have noticed your tv if it takes in an analog
[3875.24 --> 3881.48]  source does a couple of things number one is even compared to its normal input lag it adds even more
[3881.48 --> 3890.20]  lag and number two is it does a crap-tastic job of the conversion it'll look like garbage so the frame meister
[3890.20 --> 3896.52]  does a great job of both of those things yeah at 400 it's a lot it's a lot but when you look at a
[3896.52 --> 3901.80]  premium tv you look at the bomb cost of a premium tv we're talking like five six seven thousand us
[3901.80 --> 3908.04]  dollars is it unreasonable to think a couple of things number one that by cheaping out on some
[3908.04 --> 3914.28]  stuff we don't care about like how thin it is that they could find some of that cost to spend on
[3914.28 --> 3919.16]  good analog to digital conversion and number two that they could achieve economies of scale that would
[3919.16 --> 3922.84]  make a frame meister cost a lot less it's not expensive hardware really aren't that many
[3922.84 --> 3927.72]  frame meisters that's one of the reasons why they're so expensive exactly so anyway that was
[3927.72 --> 3934.84]  one of the ideas so retro gamers could game on their new tv and have a not crap experience um so we've
[3934.84 --> 3940.04]  got a bunch of other ideas um a modular system for the speakers yeah that's the one thing i had heard
[3940.04 --> 3944.84]  about so you can take them off they just clip on and they have like just contacts that go or you could
[3944.84 --> 3949.72]  take them off reposition them run speaker wire and then you could add like the rest of a kit or
[3949.72 --> 3955.72]  something like that um display port in was one of the things we asked for so there's a bunch of stuff
[3955.72 --> 3965.00]  a lot of which would be very low cost to implement um a return to front io right yeah like come on bring
[3965.00 --> 3970.36]  back i always nice i don't mind a little chin bar you know give me and so front uh front usb charging
[3970.36 --> 3978.52]  ports for controllers um for like uh vr accessories things like that so there's just a bunch of stuff
[3978.52 --> 3983.48]  we came up with we designed what we think is a gaming tv and we would love for the tv industry to
[3984.20 --> 3992.04]  you know maybe wake the crap up uh we took a look at the first all amd gaming pc from dell it's like
[3992.04 --> 3997.00]  taped onto the side well yeah but there's an actual chip inside too that was for illustrative purposes luke
[3997.00 --> 4005.08]  that's awesome how many pcie extensions is too many and the answer is a lot was it still working
[4005.08 --> 4011.64]  then you bet oh my god um that's crazy organization vlog day one wow we've actually got a lot of good
[4011.64 --> 4016.76]  stuff on here right now cool the last uh last week i think it was i wasn't that enamored with a lot of
