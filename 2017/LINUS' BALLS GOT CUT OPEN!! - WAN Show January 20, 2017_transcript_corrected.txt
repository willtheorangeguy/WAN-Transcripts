[0.00 → 8.90] Okay, welcome to the WAN show for real, sucks. At least that's what we think.
[9.00 → 10.00] The USB controller show?
[10.30 → 16.36] The USB controller show. Okay, okay. So let's just power through the intro here.
[17.38 → 21.88] AT&T shuts down their 2G network. Trumpsingles.com, make dating great again.
[21.88 → 31.28] Nintendo signals the end for the Wii U, and Gabe Newell confirms new IP in the Half-Life Portal universe.
[31.46 → 34.24] I'm going to recycle the joke from last time, IPv6. What are you pointing at?
[34.32 → 35.94] Everything you say is getting compressed.
[36.08 → 39.82] Everything I say is getting compressed? No, no, no, this is maybe a little bit. Yeah, I'm really loud.
[40.80 → 46.20] Wait, wait, let me talk for a sec. Don't say anything. Okay, yeah. Okay, yeah, I do too.
[46.36 → 49.64] Also, I think I have this a little closer than we did when we were setting it up.
[49.64 → 52.38] I don't think we want literally everything we say to be compressed.
[52.46 → 54.06] Yeah, that's fine. We can fine-tune that.
[54.20 → 60.42] The main problem that we had with the audio before on the show was that we didn't have everything configured correctly
[60.42 → 62.76] so that the compressor settings would work.
[63.30 → 66.64] Now they will, and I can walk you through it all later.
[67.48 → 68.60] But in the meantime...
[68.60 → 71.74] Well, I think I sort of get it. Remember when I, like, a month or two ago, when I was like,
[71.76 → 72.84] I don't think that's how that works?
[72.90 → 75.54] Yeah, but you won't know which dials are what.
[75.54 → 80.10] So I'll just walk you through how the control command station works.
[81.08 → 84.32] Let's go ahead and roll the intro that doesn't have sound.
[85.10 → 91.64] And maybe we'll use this opportunity to explain why we were having audio cutouts.
[92.32 → 93.90] So, guys...
[93.90 → 96.56] I feel like we should do a proper, like, once the intro's done thing.
[96.86 → 98.32] Do you want to do it after the intro's done?
[98.44 → 98.56] All right.
[98.56 → 99.44] Because, like, it's kind of cool.
[99.54 → 100.54] Let's do it after the intro's done.
[100.54 → 100.98] It's interesting.
[100.98 → 101.50] Okay.
[101.64 → 105.10] I've got a lot of people asking me to finish the vasectomy story.
[105.44 → 106.80] I'm actually really surprised.
[107.46 → 109.44] I really thought people were...
[109.44 → 110.04] It's also interesting.
[110.42 → 112.00] ...not going to be that interested in that.
[112.84 → 113.18] Okay.
[114.10 → 115.04] Yeah, fine.
[115.24 → 115.98] Okay, so...
[116.58 → 117.06] Well, okay.
[117.10 → 118.20] Remember, this is going up to YouTube.
[118.36 → 119.28] So you should start from the beginning.
[119.46 → 119.72] Okay.
[119.86 → 120.16] Okay.
[120.16 → 121.02] I'll start from the beginning.
[121.22 → 123.18] So I don't want to have any more kids.
[123.54 → 123.70] Yep.
[123.70 → 126.70] And there is actually a lot...
[126.70 → 132.56] Like any medical procedure or medication, there's a lot of information and there's a lot of...
[132.56 → 133.12] It's hard to research.
[133.26 → 133.38] There's a lot of...
[133.38 → 134.56] There's a lot of misinformation.
[134.82 → 134.94] Yeah.
[135.44 → 140.52] Like, there's people out there that are just like, okay, so you're neutered then?
[141.30 → 142.96] Like, you'll have no sex drive.
[143.02 → 143.94] You'll have no hormones.
[145.60 → 149.22] But actually, it doesn't affect that stuff at all.
[149.22 → 156.42] All it does is cut off the supply of actual sperm cells to the rest of the...
[156.42 → 160.70] And I'm just going to have to, like, use, you know, queasy words here, you guys, because
[160.70 → 161.32] it's all about...
[161.32 → 162.26] Those are queasy words.
[162.40 → 163.22] Like, get off the internet.
[163.30 → 163.84] It's all about...
[163.84 → 165.34] It's all about clear communication, okay?
[165.38 → 168.74] So there's a lot more than just sperm in male ejaculate.
[169.24 → 171.58] So, you know, all of that...
[171.58 → 174.86] All the man juices are still very much flowing...
[174.86 → 178.04] I love how you go from, like, proper medical terms to man juices.
[178.04 → 180.76] Well, I did call it ejaculate.
[181.42 → 182.58] And then man juices.
[183.14 → 187.44] But remember, ejaculate would also normally contain sperm, whereas man juices are just
[187.44 → 187.88] the juices.
[188.20 → 194.00] So now the only thing that has changed is he now has spermless ejaculate.
[194.14 → 194.46] Yes.
[194.58 → 195.64] And you absorb it back in your body.
[195.64 → 197.40] And you reabsorb the sperm cells.
[197.78 → 200.20] So effectively, my body just got more efficient.
[200.56 → 200.80] Yeah.
[201.74 → 203.12] You're less wasteful.
[203.52 → 205.10] You're a better recycling plant.
[205.24 → 205.78] Yeah, that's right.
[205.78 → 208.04] So basically, you get in.
[208.56 → 211.78] And it was really weird because I didn't know...
[212.80 → 214.74] Best start to a WAN show ever.
[215.02 → 222.30] I know for a lot of women, they prefer to have a female nurse or female doctor do, like,
[222.34 → 224.34] pelvic exams, pap smears, all that kind of stuff.
[224.34 → 226.52] But for me, I...
[226.52 → 232.64] Okay, it turned out to be a female, like, nurse and preparatory crew and a male doctor.
[233.00 → 239.84] So whichever one made me uncomfortable, I was going to have that experience one way or the other.
[240.18 → 240.30] Yeah.
[240.30 → 244.98] But honestly, like, once I got there, it was just so...
[244.98 → 245.36] Clinical?
[245.70 → 246.22] Like, yeah.
[246.50 → 252.10] Like, I'm probably not the only person ever who's been like, you know, what if I pop a boner on the operating table?
[252.24 → 252.98] Wouldn't that be awkward?
[253.08 → 255.08] Let me tell you, there is absolutely nothing...
[255.08 → 259.36] There's nothing exciting about this experience.
[259.36 → 265.36] They're like, okay, you know, drop trowel.
[266.26 → 268.12] Stand on the stool, drop trowel.
[268.22 → 269.04] I'm like, like, everything?
[269.24 → 270.02] They're like, yep.
[270.84 → 271.82] I'm like, okay.
[272.62 → 273.74] They're like, get up on the table.
[274.98 → 279.74] The little kit says to shave the area.
[280.50 → 284.56] And I tried, but apparently I didn't do a good enough job, so they fixed that for me.
[284.56 → 285.22] Okay, yeah.
[285.22 → 289.28] So there's that.
[289.52 → 291.92] Then they just, like, iodine you up.
[292.08 → 300.22] And then what had to be the most awkward part of the whole experience, like, more awkward than...
[300.22 → 309.64] And I'm going to try not to get too gory on this, but, like, more awkward than the like, 70 centimetre long string
[309.64 → 315.88] that was being pulled through something and, like, kind of tightened.
[316.42 → 318.24] Okay, so more awkward than that.
[318.24 → 327.74] The most awkward part of the experience is the like, it looks like just rubber bands tied together, like, like, like on a clipboard to hold a pen in place.
[327.74 → 328.10] Yeah.
[328.28 → 329.72] So they have, like, one of those.
[330.08 → 332.98] And they're just like, okay, so we're just going to tie this around your penis.
[333.38 → 336.10] And then they have a like, to hold it out of the way.
[336.18 → 337.64] And then they have, like, a safety pin.
[337.84 → 339.68] And they just, like, clip it to your shirt.
[340.84 → 344.88] So it's like if you were to...
[344.88 → 347.94] It's like if you were to need to defy gravity for some reason.
[348.28 → 349.62] I've heard this story, and it's still awesome.
[349.64 → 353.98] You just, like, have, like a penis retention mechanism.
[354.24 → 354.92] Yeah, yeah.
[354.94 → 355.84] That holds it up.
[355.84 → 360.48] And I'm just like, okay, sure, that's fine, I guess.
[361.96 → 365.14] So then they just kind of, they leave you there for a little bit.
[365.26 → 366.78] And then the place that I went...
[366.78 → 368.04] They just leave you there for a little bit.
[368.12 → 368.30] Yeah.
[368.40 → 368.80] All pinned up.
[368.84 → 369.64] While I wait for the doctor.
[369.92 → 370.16] Yeah.
[370.26 → 372.20] Because, like, the doctor's time is very important.
[372.28 → 372.88] This is crazy.
[373.20 → 373.36] Okay.
[373.40 → 374.38] So the guy comes in.
[374.92 → 376.94] He's in the room with me for, like, six minutes.
[377.98 → 378.28] Okay.
[378.32 → 380.44] And I'm like, how many of these do you do a day?
[380.62 → 381.50] And he's like, 50.
[381.92 → 384.16] I'm like, excuse me, five, zero?
[385.20 → 385.52] 50.
[385.84 → 387.92] 50 vasectomies in a day.
[388.56 → 390.10] Holy crap.
[390.38 → 390.80] Right?
[392.56 → 393.12] Wow.
[393.60 → 393.92] Okay.
[394.38 → 394.70] All right.
[394.70 → 399.22] So, like, they got this down to a freaking science, man.
[399.22 → 408.00] So he comes in, and they're like, they describe the numbing process as, like, being flicked in the balls with a rubber band.
[408.16 → 411.00] And I'm like, wow, great Sahel's pitch.
[411.46 → 413.38] Because that sounds horrible.
[413.38 → 414.10] That sounds terrible.
[414.76 → 417.42] It actually feels nothing like that.
[417.56 → 417.90] Okay.
[418.76 → 423.64] The bad news is that it feels more like, you know, when they put the topical numbing in your mouth?
[424.26 → 426.52] And then they're like, you're not going to feel a thing.
[426.52 → 428.30] And they inject you with the real numbing.
[428.52 → 434.84] And you're like, I can definitely tell there's, like, I can feel a thing.
[434.84 → 435.14] Yeah.
[435.26 → 438.62] And it's like, it's not pain, but it's really uncomfortable.
[438.88 → 439.20] Yes.
[439.40 → 439.62] Yeah.
[439.62 → 444.08] So, as for the actual procedure, I didn't watch.
[444.16 → 446.42] They actually had a mirror in the corner of the room.
[447.04 → 450.14] And I was just like, I'm not looking at that mirror.
[450.30 → 453.36] Fortunately, they also had a TV with sports.
[453.38 → 453.78] Yeah.
[454.16 → 454.72] There you go.
[454.74 → 455.60] On the ceiling.
[455.80 → 456.08] Yeah.
[456.08 → 460.70] So, I was like, you know, this is very similar to the world's most comfortable gaming setup.
[460.90 → 466.20] Other than that, someone's digging around in my spaghetti bag with, like, tools.
[466.52 → 466.80] Yeah.
[467.28 → 467.50] Yeah.
[467.50 → 473.04] I feel like I'd almost want to, like, record the mirror and not look at it at the time.
[473.06 → 474.02] Oh, Lord, no.
[474.02 → 477.46] Because I'd want to, like, I'd be interested just for, like, educational purposes, like,
[477.52 → 479.08] what goes through the procedure.
[479.22 → 480.16] But, like, I don't want to see it in a moment.
[480.16 → 483.48] Speaking of educational purposes, they wanted to bring in a bunch of students.
[483.84 → 490.94] And I was just like, you know, a bunch of college kids, young, you know, savvy.
[491.94 → 497.02] The odds of some, I don't need, I don't need a Linus Tech Tips viewer.
[497.50 → 500.14] Like, witnessing your balls being cut open.
[500.26 → 500.58] Yeah.
[500.82 → 503.28] I just, I don't need that experience in my life.
[503.42 → 508.52] It was bad enough that his partner, so there's actually two vasectomy doctors that run this
[508.52 → 509.06] clinic together.
[509.06 → 515.72] So his partner called me up for my morning consult and was, like, at the end of it, where he's
[515.72 → 518.36] like, yeah, how many kids do you have and blah, blah, blah, all this stuff.
[518.80 → 521.26] And he's like, okay, yes, you're a good candidate, et cetera.
[521.36 → 524.14] At the end of it, he's like, so are you going to make a video about it?
[524.64 → 528.78] And I'm like, terrible.
[529.26 → 529.54] Terrible.
[529.54 → 529.58] Terrible.
[530.20 → 531.80] Nothing against the guy professionally.
[531.92 → 533.32] I'm sure he's a great vasectomy doctor.
[534.20 → 536.34] But that's funny.
[536.62 → 542.66] But that's, like, I'm glad that I specifically requested the other doctor in the first place.
[542.68 → 542.90] Yeah.
[542.98 → 548.40] Because, like, I'd have hated for my name to come across and be like, oh, yeah, I watched
[548.40 → 549.14] that guy's videos.
[549.24 → 549.72] I'll do that.
[549.72 → 555.86] But then maybe the flip side is, would a fan of the channel be extra careful?
[559.44 → 560.46] Oh, my God.
[560.86 → 566.18] Or they're like, yeah, I don't think you should have won Scrapyard War.
[566.26 → 566.50] Yeah.
[570.70 → 575.44] It's like, or, like, what if they were, like, because, like, we've had, like, really, like,
[576.08 → 578.68] creepily, like, into us fans before.
[578.90 → 579.04] Yeah.
[579.04 → 583.60] What if they were, like, you know, I want to preserve more of your genetic material.
[583.70 → 584.32] I'm going to screw it up.
[584.46 → 585.12] Like, you know what?
[585.16 → 585.78] It's funny.
[585.90 → 587.86] Like, obviously, that's ridiculous, right?
[587.86 → 588.20] Yes.
[588.34 → 591.10] But you hear about crazier stuff in the news.
[591.18 → 591.36] Yeah.
[591.78 → 597.36] You hear about, like, dentists who aren't licensed at all, who have been practicing in,
[597.36 → 602.40] I think it was Burnaby, for, like, 15 years and preying on, like, new immigrants who don't
[602.40 → 606.16] speak English and just, like, practicing dentistry out of their house.
[606.26 → 608.00] And the whole thing's just, like, horrifying.
[608.00 → 614.88] And there's, like, there's, like, you know, no, wow, words are failing me here.
[615.20 → 620.04] But sterilization of the tools and, like, just insanity.
[620.78 → 624.32] And this is a very, very reputable clinic.
[625.14 → 627.68] You have 50 vasectomies a day, you know.
[627.68 → 633.40] And their rating on, like, Google is, like, four stars.
[633.62 → 633.96] Oh, wow.
[633.96 → 638.88] Which, like, for me to rate someone four to five stars for cutting open my balls, I better
[638.88 → 640.18] be having a great experience.
[642.18 → 645.08] That better be some fantastic customer service.
[645.10 → 646.14] It comes with a mint at the end.
[648.14 → 649.68] Did they give you, like...
[649.68 → 652.86] No, they gave me a big bag of Tylenol.
[653.44 → 653.84] Okay.
[654.94 → 661.08] If they had Tylenol mints, that would be the next level.
[661.18 → 661.62] Yeah, yeah.
[661.78 → 663.60] Yeah, four stars would do again.
[663.92 → 664.90] Exactly, my friends.
[665.00 → 665.72] Oh, my God.
[666.54 → 667.36] Second topic?
[667.78 → 668.30] Are you ready?
[668.44 → 669.04] Yeah, yeah.
[669.10 → 670.20] We can go into other topics.
[670.28 → 671.10] But hold on a second.
[671.14 → 671.78] Hold on a second.
[671.78 → 673.38] Someone's, like...
[673.38 → 676.20] I mean, how TMI do we want to get?
[676.28 → 677.58] Someone's, like, just use a condom.
[678.32 → 678.80] It's, like...
[678.80 → 679.50] That's not...
[679.50 → 680.08] They suck.
[680.38 → 680.72] Yeah.
[681.40 → 681.80] There.
[681.90 → 683.72] That's all I have to say about that.
[684.52 → 691.00] It's, like, if I'm in a monogamous relationship where there are no concerns about STDs, then, like,
[691.78 → 692.38] you know what?
[693.46 → 694.68] F condoms, man.
[696.10 → 697.38] That is, like...
[697.38 → 700.58] But you went the right route in order to say that.
[700.92 → 701.30] Yes.
[701.78 → 704.08] Don't just say that if you don't get the operation done.
[704.26 → 704.56] Yes, yes.
[704.68 → 707.06] If you want to be able to say that, go get the operation done.
[707.08 → 707.20] Yeah.
[707.44 → 714.94] With that said, I'm a strong believer that many, many men think that they definitely don't
[714.94 → 719.26] want kids when they're young and can easily change their mind later on in their lives.
[719.30 → 720.30] I went the other way around.
[720.30 → 728.34] I wanted four to five, and now I'm, like, super pleased with three and definitely don't
[728.34 → 729.08] want any more.
[729.52 → 730.52] I'm a holdout.
[730.52 → 734.84] I'm 26 now, for those wondering, and I still don't want kids.
[734.92 → 737.86] Lots of guys decide they want kids at, like, 40.
[738.22 → 738.42] Yeah.
[738.50 → 741.52] And it's, like, a revelation.
[742.34 → 743.18] And they're just like, oh.
[743.58 → 747.66] And so, you know, don't do it just because you don't want to wear a condom.
[747.74 → 748.98] That's not a good reason, kids.
[748.98 → 755.20] Do it because you're very sure you never, ever, ever, ever, ever want to impregnate anyone
[755.20 → 755.82] ever again.
[755.82 → 762.02] And as annoying as the like, being someone who has always said for eternity that they
[762.02 → 762.66] don't want kids.
[762.88 → 767.34] As annoying as it is having everyone be like, well, you're going to be older and your mind
[767.34 → 768.14] might change.
[768.86 → 770.84] It's a pretty serious surgery.
[771.42 → 772.22] So, yeah.
[772.34 → 773.60] I would be careful with that one.
[774.02 → 774.44] Next topic?
[774.64 → 774.90] Yeah.
[775.04 → 775.22] Yeah.
[775.22 → 775.56] Let's.
[775.56 → 775.96] Okay.
[775.98 → 776.34] So, wait.
[776.42 → 777.72] I need you to do a thing.
[778.06 → 778.26] Oh.
[778.38 → 779.22] I got to do a thing.
[779.30 → 779.48] Yeah.
[779.54 → 780.48] So, you got to look something up.
[780.54 → 780.80] Okay.
[780.88 → 782.28] Look up the Hot Wheels computer.
[782.52 → 784.00] The Hot Wheels computer.
[784.26 → 784.56] Yes.
[784.74 → 785.84] Have you seen this before?
[785.94 → 786.08] Okay.
[786.16 → 787.38] Before we do this.
[787.48 → 787.70] Yeah.
[788.02 → 789.36] And I believe I have seen it.
[789.74 → 790.00] Yeah.
[790.06 → 790.50] This one, right?
[790.50 → 790.64] Yeah.
[790.78 → 790.96] Yeah.
[790.96 → 791.26] Okay.
[791.36 → 794.96] So, before we do that, I want to explain the audio cutout issues.
[795.62 → 796.08] Because I think.
[796.08 → 796.18] Yes.
[796.30 → 796.56] Sorry.
[796.74 → 796.90] Yeah.
[797.02 → 798.62] Our viewers deserve an explanation.
[799.08 → 800.26] And so does Focus rite.
[800.46 → 802.82] So, Focus rite came by this week.
[802.82 → 807.12] And they got us hooked the math up.
[807.22 → 807.60] Yeah, I did.
[807.62 → 808.50] On our audio gear.
[808.58 → 813.20] We're going to have a full video of, like, redoing the WAN show setup in the next little bit here.
[813.30 → 815.98] Where we go through all the stuff that they set us up with.
[815.98 → 822.26] But, basically, we've got this EPM6 mixer that will allow us to take any audio source.
[822.36 → 823.44] Like, we could just grab a phone.
[823.72 → 824.04] Boom.
[824.26 → 825.50] We've got a slider for it.
[825.52 → 827.68] So, we can take any audio source in now.
[827.80 → 829.06] Just analog audio in.
[829.30 → 829.74] Fantastic.
[829.74 → 829.94] Fantastic.
[830.30 → 835.32] They hooked us up with a Headlamp 6 Pro for monitoring the stream in real time.
[835.98 → 841.14] Which will be great, you know, if and when we decide to expand and get more guests or whatever the case may be.
[841.20 → 843.02] If Luke and I each want to monitor separately.
[843.44 → 845.64] If we want to monitor separately at different levels.
[845.98 → 846.94] Because we have different headphones.
[847.14 → 848.06] Freaking fantastic.
[848.64 → 850.02] They hooked up our DBX.
[850.26 → 852.62] It's a 166XS compressor.
[852.80 → 853.76] So, that's working now.
[854.12 → 855.38] We've still got to do some fine-tuning.
[855.38 → 860.32] But, they've got it set up and, like, they've created a guide for me so I can make sure I can do it correctly.
[860.72 → 865.86] And, they hooked us up with their 18i20 Scarlett audio interface.
[866.06 → 872.50] So, that we have a gorgeous preamp on the SE4400A microphone that they also hooked us up with.
[872.58 → 876.54] Like, these guys came in, brought us all the gear and set it up for us.
[876.54 → 879.14] And, we had a bunch of audio cutouts on the show today.
[879.56 → 881.56] That is not their fault.
[881.96 → 888.60] It appears to have been related to having multiple capture cards running on the same USB controller on the motherboard.
[889.18 → 896.52] Throwing an additional PCIe USB controller in there and splitting the capture cards between the two of them has resolved the issue.
[896.52 → 902.04] And, for those of you saying, hey, the audio is still not as good on the show as it could be, we're aware of that.
[902.34 → 904.00] And, we've talked to Focus rite about it.
[904.12 → 911.14] And, we're going to look into getting some, there's stuff called Ultra Touch that is like a denim, it's a cotton-based batting.
[911.58 → 923.16] That, from my discussions with Silent Mike the Chin over at Silent PC Review, is the bomb as far as reducing those echoes while still having it sound really natural.
[923.16 → 924.70] So, we want to get a cloud above us.
[924.70 → 929.72] We want to get a couple of those in front of us, break up some of the standing waves in here, and we are going to take it to the next level.
[929.80 → 932.06] But, for now, we have a reliable setup.
[932.34 → 940.04] And, there's no reason for you guys to deal with that screechy peeking anymore because our compressor is finally working.
[940.24 → 940.40] Yeah.
[940.58 → 942.80] Most people don't host shows in, like, a warehouse.
[943.32 → 943.72] Yeah.
[945.64 → 946.04] What?
[946.46 → 946.70] Yeah.
[947.12 → 947.60] You need him?
[948.08 → 949.06] Oh, you need me for something?
[949.94 → 950.34] Okay.
[950.34 → 951.48] Ed needs to borrow me.
[951.48 → 955.54] So, that's okay because you got your Hot Wheels computer.
[955.64 → 957.44] Well, no, I wanted to show, this is.
[957.54 → 958.50] Oh, you want to discuss it?
[958.52 → 958.76] Yeah.
[959.00 → 959.78] Oh, okay.
[959.90 → 961.18] There's, like, things to say.
[961.38 → 964.86] Okay, maybe do, maybe do another topic in the meantime.
[964.86 → 965.20] Sure.
[965.44 → 966.12] I'll be right back.
[966.18 → 967.74] I'm assuming what he needs is very important.
[968.44 → 968.98] I hope so.
[969.08 → 970.04] Oh, okay.
[970.28 → 971.44] This is going to take a moment.
[972.08 → 973.04] Don't go too quickly.
[973.10 → 973.66] Yeah, I'm good.
[974.06 → 974.42] It's okay.
[974.42 → 974.50] Okay.
[975.24 → 975.56] Okay.
[975.84 → 976.84] So, topic.
[977.06 → 977.78] Line of screen.
[978.22 → 978.62] Blew.
[978.98 → 979.76] There we go.
[980.06 → 986.06] Nintendo Signals End for Wii U might seem a little early considering they haven't even released
[986.06 → 987.14] their new console yet.
[987.24 → 988.04] And you would be right.
[988.12 → 989.12] It is rather early.
[989.80 → 996.72] Apparently, Reggie, you guys know Reggie, Nintendo America guy, has told Polygon that Legend of Zelda
[996.72 → 1002.46] Breath of the Wild would be the last game that the company is releasing on the Wii U.
[1002.46 → 1008.54] And he has very specifically said, we really are at the end of life for Wii U.
[1010.92 → 1012.44] That's pretty much the entire topic.
[1012.88 → 1015.34] But that's kind of ridiculous.
[1015.96 → 1018.52] It's literally, like, the end has been signalled.
[1019.24 → 1022.02] And the Switch isn't even out yet.
[1022.96 → 1025.06] Mario Kart 8 was Wii U's best-selling game.
[1025.16 → 1026.22] 8 million copies sold.
[1026.56 → 1028.04] Wii U didn't do that amazing.
[1031.32 → 1032.16] Oh, Nintendo.
[1032.46 → 1039.58] That being said, the end of life thing is only being quoted for Nintendo games.
[1040.10 → 1047.50] But Nintendo games are pretty much the only thing that matters in terms of, like, really
[1047.50 → 1049.90] large selling titles on the Nintendo platform.
[1050.50 → 1051.76] So, I don't know.
[1052.10 → 1054.38] I'm really excited for people to watch this.
[1055.92 → 1059.08] I kind of want to go get my ice pack before I sit down.
[1059.44 → 1059.94] You know what?
[1059.94 → 1061.48] I would get someone else to get your ice pack.
[1064.24 → 1064.56] Okay.
[1065.20 → 1065.78] Yeah, fine.
[1066.94 → 1069.72] I mean, I kind of have to put it on in private anyway.
[1069.98 → 1070.52] Oh, yeah.
[1070.64 → 1070.88] Okay.
[1071.10 → 1071.66] Good call.
[1071.66 → 1080.52] Is it weird, like, getting someone to grab an ice pack that you, like, has been...
[1080.52 → 1081.92] No skin to skin.
[1082.18 → 1082.62] Okay.
[1082.62 → 1083.52] No skin to skin contact.
[1083.70 → 1083.96] Okay.
[1084.22 → 1084.46] Okay.
[1084.80 → 1086.06] It's also probably very clean.
[1087.78 → 1089.22] Do you want to grab it for him?
[1089.30 → 1089.76] There we go.
[1090.64 → 1091.00] Thanks.
[1091.00 → 1094.18] Anyway, Linus will be here in a moment.
[1094.24 → 1095.10] Well, you got to...
[1095.10 → 1095.70] Remember...
[1095.70 → 1096.40] Yeah, that's okay.
[1096.52 → 1097.22] I'll just be over here.
[1097.32 → 1097.96] You just can do it behind the chair.
[1102.80 → 1103.36] Don't worry.
[1103.36 → 1106.24] This is awesome.
[1106.48 → 1106.74] Okay.
[1107.12 → 1109.18] The next topic that we will be discussing...
[1109.18 → 1109.74] Oh, funny thing.
[1109.84 → 1110.36] Funny thing.
[1110.72 → 1112.42] I was like, so what about stairs?
[1112.60 → 1114.78] And they're like, oh, your house has stairs?
[1115.62 → 1116.64] And I'm just like, what?
[1117.24 → 1118.78] How am I supposed to do anything?
[1118.78 → 1123.04] Yeah, my house has stairs.
[1127.12 → 1134.10] And they give you, like, a jock strap, but without a cup, to kind of lift, support, and
[1134.10 → 1135.10] separate kind of thing.
[1135.28 → 1135.54] Mm-hmm.
[1135.80 → 1136.06] Mm-hmm.
[1136.74 → 1137.30] Okay.
[1138.06 → 1138.98] That is cold.
[1139.88 → 1140.96] That is cold.
[1141.02 → 1142.92] Some cold relief right there.
[1143.68 → 1143.96] Okay.
[1144.18 → 1144.78] Hold on.
[1144.82 → 1145.56] I just got to...
[1145.56 → 1147.34] Okay.
[1147.34 → 1147.42] Okay.
[1147.86 → 1148.34] Oh.
[1148.78 → 1150.08] Just getting down here.
[1150.22 → 1150.44] Yep.
[1151.24 → 1152.48] So, here, one second.
[1152.62 → 1152.88] Okay.
[1153.32 → 1154.06] We need to...
[1154.06 → 1154.76] I'm having fun.
[1155.20 → 1156.36] Hope everybody's having fun.
[1156.48 → 1157.00] Can I do this?
[1157.14 → 1157.82] Yeah, go for it.
[1157.90 → 1158.16] Okay.
[1158.60 → 1158.90] Okay.
[1159.56 → 1160.22] Ah, yes.
[1160.30 → 1161.80] The good old Hot Wheels PC.
[1162.36 → 1162.56] Yeah.
[1162.76 → 1165.16] So, I can't claim complete credit for this.
[1165.36 → 1171.22] Someone sent this to me on my stream thing and was like, you should do a mod like this.
[1171.52 → 1176.26] And I took that very literally instead of as a joke and have been trying to figure out
[1176.26 → 1182.22] some way that I could do a modern version of the Hot Wheels PC for a little while now.
[1182.64 → 1185.18] And decided eventually, like, you know what?
[1185.30 → 1186.86] Maybe I should just sit Colton on it.
[1187.28 → 1190.38] So, Colton just messaged Hot Wheels.
[1190.84 → 1191.24] Seriously?
[1191.24 → 1192.24] Seriously?
[1192.24 → 1197.96] And the YouTube partner of Mattel messaged back and was like, hey, cool, yeah, we should
[1197.96 → 1198.52] get on a call.
[1199.02 → 1199.30] No!
[1199.70 → 1205.68] So, we might legit be making, like, an approved, like, Hot Wheels is in on it with us.
[1205.92 → 1206.88] No way!
[1207.48 → 1207.76] Mod.
[1207.76 → 1212.16] Like this, but for, like, a modern computer.
[1212.28 → 1213.70] So, I'll get, like, a modern keyboard.
[1214.06 → 1215.08] That would be...
[1215.08 → 1216.12] And, like, deckle it out like that.
[1216.22 → 1216.86] D-A.
[1217.22 → 1217.54] Yeah.
[1217.78 → 1219.88] That would be absolutely bananas.
[1219.90 → 1224.54] And now that they're in on it, I'm going to try to do, like, the racing wheel and, like...
[1224.54 → 1224.86] Yeah.
[1225.14 → 1227.02] ...the mouse pad and the speakers and everything.
[1227.02 → 1229.98] We could probably get, like, guys like Brand involved.
[1230.18 → 1231.64] We could probably get...
[1231.64 → 1232.52] Oh, who do we know?
[1233.02 → 1233.58] I don't...
[1233.58 → 1234.10] You know what?
[1234.10 → 1238.16] I wonder if, like, neighbour Steve would help us out with some of the flames and stuff.
[1238.60 → 1239.04] Like...
[1239.04 → 1239.58] So, he'd, like...
[1239.58 → 1241.32] He could, like, paint it properly.
[1241.56 → 1241.94] Yeah.
[1242.26 → 1242.46] Yeah.
[1242.52 → 1246.16] Like, I'm thinking, like, sky's the limit for a project like this.
[1246.16 → 1248.00] I want to make it, like, super awesome.
[1248.42 → 1248.52] Yeah.
[1248.60 → 1249.12] That's sick.
[1249.32 → 1251.80] Should we still have a CRT just for fun?
[1252.80 → 1253.66] I don't think so.
[1253.72 → 1254.00] Okay.
[1254.12 → 1254.34] Okay.
[1254.34 → 1254.80] Because I think...
[1254.80 → 1259.10] Because I think the idea should be, like, this is a pretty wicked, like, modern...
[1259.10 → 1259.44] Okay.
[1259.46 → 1260.30] ...like, Hot Wheels...
[1260.30 → 1260.58] Okay.
[1260.76 → 1261.68] ...kind of deal.
[1261.80 → 1262.36] I'm down.
[1262.60 → 1262.78] Yeah.
[1262.78 → 1268.28] What we should try to do, though, is if we can, we should try and get the original tower chassis.
[1269.64 → 1272.34] I think that's going to be nigh impossible.
[1272.84 → 1273.22] You think so?
[1273.22 → 1274.80] And again, that wouldn't be a modern thing.
[1274.84 → 1276.42] It has, like, a floppy drive area.
[1276.60 → 1276.90] No.
[1277.26 → 1277.82] Does it?
[1277.88 → 1278.66] Yeah, but we could...
[1278.66 → 1280.20] No, we could modernize it.
[1280.86 → 1281.62] Modernize it.
[1281.64 → 1282.60] So, we could use...
[1282.60 → 1285.12] So, there was a really cool mod on the forum.
[1285.44 → 1286.08] Not a moderator.
[1286.38 → 1288.36] A really cool, like, computer mod on the forum.
[1288.62 → 1289.58] All the mods on the forum are cool.
[1289.58 → 1296.44] Where a guy built an SD card reader where you load your SD card into a floppy diskette and
[1296.44 → 1299.34] pop it into a floppy drive that was modified to read SD cards.
[1299.42 → 1300.06] That's pretty cool.
[1300.36 → 1303.44] So, like, we could...
[1303.44 → 1304.98] But, ah, I want to make it, like...
[1304.98 → 1306.92] I don't want to just, like, recreate the old thing.
[1307.02 → 1307.08] Okay.
[1307.08 → 1308.32] I want to make a cool new thing.
[1308.46 → 1308.82] Okay.
[1309.22 → 1309.48] All right.
[1309.48 → 1309.82] Straw pull.
[1309.94 → 1310.30] Straw pull.
[1310.52 → 1310.82] Straw pull.
[1310.82 → 1311.16] Straw pull.
[1311.36 → 1311.66] Yeah.
[1311.66 → 1312.66] Straw pull.
[1312.66 → 1313.34] Straw pull that.
[1313.78 → 1315.16] Of course we've got to straw pull that.
[1315.28 → 1316.32] Let the people decide.
[1316.52 → 1316.84] Let...
[1316.84 → 1317.18] Yeah.
[1318.16 → 1320.78] We're giving the decision back to you, the people.
[1321.10 → 1321.32] Yeah.
[1322.52 → 1322.88] Um...
[1322.88 → 1325.36] Sorry that I don't remember who recommended it on my thing.
[1325.46 → 1327.52] This was, like, many months ago.
[1327.70 → 1329.34] And it's just coming to fruition now.
[1330.70 → 1331.24] All right.
[1331.28 → 1331.46] Wait.
[1331.46 → 1331.80] Okay.
[1331.92 → 1332.90] Getting the old chassis.
[1333.04 → 1333.94] You're talking...
[1333.94 → 1334.60] Uh...
[1334.60 → 1336.70] Old school versus new school.
[1336.90 → 1337.74] I think is, like...
[1337.74 → 1338.80] What's going on?
[1338.80 → 1341.44] Okay.
[1341.60 → 1342.06] There we go.
[1342.14 → 1343.22] So I've got what chassis?
[1343.38 → 1345.38] Old one modded or create something new?
[1345.54 → 1347.96] And getting the old one, like, might not even be possible.
[1348.14 → 1349.24] So we just have to keep that in mind.
[1349.36 → 1353.04] So even if you guys do vote for the old one, we might have to go with a new one just because
[1353.04 → 1354.36] it's, like, literally not a thing.
[1354.38 → 1356.58] Twitch chat's like, build a vasectomy PC.
[1357.86 → 1359.42] That's just, like, it's half a PC.
[1359.76 → 1362.66] It's a PC without the potency.
[1362.80 → 1363.20] No venom.
[1363.62 → 1365.14] You have two separate water cooling loops.
[1365.26 → 1365.68] One is white.
[1365.76 → 1366.18] One is red.
[1368.80 → 1371.14] And what, the white one just goes nowhere?
[1372.60 → 1373.04] Well...
[1373.04 → 1373.54] Yeah.
[1373.88 → 1374.32] You still...
[1374.32 → 1375.24] It's just not...
[1375.24 → 1376.58] It gets reabsorbed.
[1376.82 → 1377.38] There just...
[1377.38 → 1380.88] Well, there just isn't, like, 3D particles inside of it, right?
[1381.10 → 1382.00] Oh, Lord.
[1382.04 → 1382.64] It's a clean loop.
[1382.86 → 1383.18] Yeah.
[1383.44 → 1383.68] Okay.
[1384.02 → 1385.10] John's like, no.
[1388.70 → 1389.14] Okay.
[1389.40 → 1392.86] So overwhelmingly, Twitch chat is, like...
[1392.86 → 1393.14] Yeah.
[1393.26 → 1393.78] They're with you.
[1394.00 → 1394.06] Yeah.
[1394.06 → 1394.34] Okay.
[1394.44 → 1395.46] They're with you on this.
[1395.46 → 1395.54] Okay.
[1395.54 → 1396.68] I clearly lost.
[1396.68 → 1398.12] So there you go.
[1398.26 → 1401.00] And, like, one thing I'm wondering about, too, is, like, you want to go to Hot Wheels' website
[1401.00 → 1401.68] real quick?
[1401.88 → 1402.92] Which I don't even...
[1402.92 → 1403.94] Like, I'm assuming they have one.
[1404.14 → 1404.72] They must have one.
[1404.78 → 1405.02] Yeah.
[1405.74 → 1406.30] Of course they have one.
[1406.40 → 1407.40] Hotwheels.com.
[1407.46 → 1408.18] E-N-C-A.
[1408.34 → 1408.48] Yeah.
[1409.48 → 1409.80] Wow.
[1410.60 → 1410.92] Whoa.
[1411.18 → 1411.64] There you go.
[1412.18 → 1412.40] Okay.
[1412.44 → 1414.46] So they still have, like, the flames kind of...
[1414.46 → 1415.76] So their branding hasn't really changed.
[1415.78 → 1416.02] No, not much.
[1416.02 → 1417.92] And it's still blue and yellow and red.
[1418.18 → 1418.42] Yep.
[1418.58 → 1418.84] Okay.
[1419.22 → 1421.40] So I was wondering if we would have to, like, change the design.
[1421.40 → 1425.18] But I think the general design can stay the same, but we just do it with modern stuff.
[1425.34 → 1428.22] Those are some actually pretty cool looking Super Mario.
[1428.52 → 1429.44] I like how they still have the moustache.
[1429.58 → 1429.96] Hot Wheels.
[1430.10 → 1430.26] Yeah.
[1430.36 → 1430.98] That's awesome.
[1431.94 → 1432.14] Okay.
[1432.18 → 1435.60] Anyway, this is not, like, a sponsored by Hot Wheels stream.
[1435.78 → 1437.78] We're just excited to be working with them.
[1437.82 → 1438.30] That's pretty cool.
[1438.46 → 1439.66] But, yeah, I think that's going to be pretty wicked.
[1439.86 → 1442.18] It's going to be a little hard for certain components, like the monitor.
[1442.80 → 1445.54] Because the CRT has way more bezel to play with.
[1445.54 → 1448.64] But I think it can make the back look really cool.
[1448.74 → 1448.88] Yeah.
[1449.00 → 1455.34] We could probably find something with, like, a cool stand that lends itself well to modification.
[1455.66 → 1457.72] Like, I think we can find a way to work with it.
[1458.30 → 1462.30] Like, I think if we just go hardcore with, like, try to stay true to the original idea
[1462.30 → 1466.46] instead of, like, the exact layout of the original one, then I think it would be good.
[1466.48 → 1470.18] I still do have to check, like, if you can get a Hot Wheels PC on you.
[1470.18 → 1473.06] I can't imagine they sold a ton of them.
[1473.66 → 1474.72] Hot Wheels PC.
[1475.54 → 1479.56] Oh, it's going to be a lot of Hot Wheels PC games.
[1479.58 → 1480.16] Hot Wheels PC games.
[1480.86 → 1481.18] Okay.
[1482.34 → 1483.48] Micro racers.
[1483.74 → 1484.02] Yeah.
[1484.30 → 1485.64] Do they say computer in them?
[1485.96 → 1487.06] Or do they just say PC?
[1487.16 → 1488.54] Because you could try Hot Wheels computer.
[1489.38 → 1489.82] Sure.
[1489.82 → 1491.62] Or Hot Wheels desktop computer or something.
[1492.40 → 1494.08] Well, here, we've got categories.
[1494.26 → 1496.78] No, toys and hobbies, video games and consoles.
[1498.64 → 1499.04] Yikes.
[1501.20 → 1501.60] Oops.
[1503.16 → 1505.16] Zero results for Hot Wheels computer.
[1505.16 → 1505.94] Okay.
[1506.54 → 1507.26] All right.
[1507.48 → 1508.46] Well, that's fine.
[1508.50 → 1509.00] I'm over it.
[1509.12 → 1509.64] I'm over it.
[1510.32 → 1510.76] Yeah.
[1510.90 → 1511.58] No problem.
[1511.82 → 1512.16] Okay.
[1513.50 → 1515.94] Speaking of things that I'm over.
[1516.38 → 1517.10] Oh, oh, oh.
[1517.16 → 1517.42] Two.
[1517.88 → 1518.32] What?
[1518.62 → 1520.74] Oh, did you find one?
[1520.76 → 1521.32] $500.
[1521.82 → 1522.54] Someone found one.
[1522.54 → 1523.00] $500.
[1523.00 → 1523.04] $500.
[1523.44 → 1524.36] That's not even that bad.
[1524.52 → 1526.74] Someone was whipped by on Twitch chat.
[1527.74 → 1529.76] A few people have posted it.
[1530.26 → 1531.46] I'm trying to find it.
[1531.46 → 1532.82] So, oh, were you on .ca?
[1533.40 → 1534.12] Oh, possibly.
[1534.38 → 1534.84] Look at that.
[1534.96 → 1535.36] What's up, dude?
[1535.42 → 1537.08] Hot Wheels desktop computer.
[1537.92 → 1540.32] System, monitor, speakers, steering wheel, keyboard.
[1540.32 → 1542.14] I wonder if this thing works.
[1543.52 → 1546.86] That would be a really cool prop for the video, but it would cost $500 freaking.
[1547.32 → 1548.74] The auction is for...
[1548.74 → 1551.98] And floppies, if you have questions, feel free to message me.
[1552.10 → 1554.32] Everything has been tested to the point of powering on.
[1555.26 → 1556.30] Desktop monitor with base.
[1556.42 → 1557.64] Base needs to be repaired.
[1557.84 → 1560.94] Original floppy disk for 93 Camaro and rigour motor.
[1562.10 → 1563.24] Oh, wow.
[1563.82 → 1566.32] Hot Wheels interactive tattoo designer.
[1566.98 → 1567.56] Hell yeah.
[1568.36 → 1568.80] Wow.
[1569.40 → 1569.76] All right.
[1569.80 → 1570.34] So there you go.
[1570.44 → 1572.02] You can apparently buy one.
[1572.48 → 1579.02] And if our previous experience trying to buy something on the WAN show is anything to go by,
[1579.02 → 1582.16] by the time I refresh this page, someone will have already bought it.
[1582.34 → 1582.84] It's gone.
[1583.08 → 1583.24] Yeah.
[1583.62 → 1584.58] 11 watching.
[1584.96 → 1585.68] 11 watching.
[1586.14 → 1587.10] Four viewed per hour.
[1588.00 → 1589.34] That thing's hot, folks.
[1589.74 → 1590.82] It's Hot Wheels.
[1590.82 → 1596.00] This guy's had no traffic on this thing at all for months.
[1596.36 → 1597.72] And then all of a sudden, it's like, whoa.
[1598.98 → 1601.00] That's the WAN show effect, my friends.
[1601.16 → 1601.38] Yeah.
[1601.92 → 1602.54] All right.
[1602.68 → 1606.90] So AT&T shuts down their 2G network.
[1607.12 → 1614.78] They announced yesterday that the 2G wireless network was officially shut down on January 1st, 2017,
[1615.56 → 1618.84] after four years of planning for its discontinuation.
[1618.84 → 1626.92] So what that means is that the original iPhone will no longer receive cellular service from the AT&T network,
[1627.10 → 1628.22] effectively shutting it down.
[1628.30 → 1640.00] So if anyone was still using the original iPhone, which I sincerely hope they were not, then you're SLO.
[1640.00 → 1647.94] I find it interesting that their first sales note for the iPhone was a widescreen iPod, not that it was a revolutionary phone.
[1649.52 → 1649.92] Yeah.
[1651.42 → 1652.52] That is interesting.
[1653.76 → 1655.22] Breakthrough internet device.
[1655.48 → 1656.44] High technology.
[1656.74 → 1657.72] High technology.
[1657.88 → 1658.74] High technology.
[1658.86 → 1660.34] Is that like a laser or something?
[1660.34 → 1660.74] I think so.
[1660.98 → 1661.64] I think it's a laser.
[1661.72 → 1662.96] I don't think it had laser beams.
[1662.96 → 1668.96] I feel like we would have made fun of it for having high technology if we were doing WAN show way back then.
[1669.12 → 1678.18] It's funny, though, because they would have had to have such a simple message behind it in order to have anyone have a chance of understanding what it was.
[1678.30 → 1678.98] That actually makes sense.
[1678.98 → 1681.20] Because nowadays, how do you describe something?
[1681.38 → 1683.44] Kind of like an iPhone, but whatever.
[1684.10 → 1684.24] Right.
[1684.24 → 1685.24] How do you describe a phone?
[1685.40 → 1685.64] Yeah.
[1686.18 → 1690.32] Or maybe not today, because now there are other good phones, but five years ago.
[1690.32 → 1690.46] But like a while back.
[1690.58 → 1690.70] Yeah.
[1690.70 → 1690.80] Yeah.
[1690.80 → 1691.06] Yeah.
[1691.06 → 1691.28] Yeah.
[1691.28 → 1691.44] Yeah.
[1691.44 → 1691.62] Yeah.
[1691.62 → 1692.94] Interesting.
[1694.40 → 1696.42] So there's not really much else to say about that.
[1696.84 → 1701.44] They're just looking to free up some more spectrum for future network technologies, including 5G.
[1702.24 → 1704.54] And I guess that's, yeah, really all there is to it.
[1704.60 → 1705.54] This is awesome.
[1706.10 → 1711.28] So they were talking about this on my favourite morning sports show.
[1711.56 → 1715.60] Because the time that I'm driving into work is actually when they do a segment called Crossover,
[1715.60 → 1724.22] where the morning hosts and the brunch hosts, like the lunch hour hosts, are overlapping in the studio for 30 minutes.
[1724.22 → 1726.50] And they almost never talk about sports.
[1726.50 → 1732.06] It's always just like a bunch of kinds of jocks brewing out about ridiculous nonsense.
[1732.06 → 1732.48] Yeah.
[1732.48 → 1741.12] So they were talking about the Trumpsingles.com website that promises to make dating great again.
[1741.12 → 1745.24] So the site experienced a membership spike.
[1745.24 → 1752.68] Apparently they've racked up around 24,000 members since the official launch in June.
[1752.68 → 1765.86] And David Goss, the site's founder, told Fox News, this is fantastic, that membership jumped by about 5,000 after Donald Trump's shock election victory in November with another wave of new members that just signed up.
[1765.86 → 1793.24] So the basic premise of the site is that Goss was upset about the divisiveness of the election season and wanted a place where people could go to meet people who, especially folks in more liberal areas, where they could have a community to go where Trump supporters wouldn't get hated on.
[1793.24 → 1796.58] He said, for example, it's hard being a Republican in the L.A. area.
[1796.78 → 1797.86] It's not an easy thing.
[1798.82 → 1803.16] One interesting little tidbit here, if you go back, is that, oh, is it gone now?
[1803.66 → 1803.88] Yeah.
[1804.92 → 1806.30] Oh, do you need me to go back to it?
[1806.36 → 1806.54] Yeah.
[1806.66 → 1807.04] Oh, wow.
[1807.56 → 1808.40] Oh, my goodness.
[1808.58 → 1809.66] This is great.
[1810.24 → 1811.80] So, okay, hold on a second.
[1812.26 → 1813.00] Okay, where do you want me?
[1813.92 → 1814.94] Keep going a little bit.
[1815.72 → 1816.52] Okay, right there.
[1818.86 → 1819.22] Perfect.
[1819.90 → 1820.40] Right here.
[1820.40 → 1826.00] Trumpsignals.com is not the only dating site to emerge from the tumult.
[1827.42 → 1827.98] Tumult.
[1828.44 → 1828.80] Tumult.
[1829.56 → 1830.48] Maple Match.
[1831.50 → 1835.78] Helps Americans fleeing the Trump presidency find a Canadian soulmate.
[1835.94 → 1836.60] Is that a thing?
[1836.84 → 1837.44] I got to open this.
[1837.44 → 1838.30] Is that even okay?
[1841.08 → 1842.34] What the heck?
[1842.54 → 1843.48] That's a print.
[1844.84 → 1845.36] Okay.
[1846.22 → 1847.12] Maple Match.
[1847.58 → 1848.78] Is this real?
[1848.78 → 1849.46] Maple Match.
[1849.70 → 1850.80] This can't be real.
[1851.02 → 1851.58] Oh, my God.
[1851.58 → 1852.74] Make dating great again.
[1853.52 → 1855.50] The dating app that makes you better at dating.
[1855.80 → 1856.98] Free iOS dating.
[1857.50 → 1860.72] Yeah, this doesn't seem to actually say anything about that.
[1863.24 → 1867.60] With the goal of bringing Americans and Canadians together in a fun, meaningful way.
[1868.22 → 1868.48] Wow.
[1868.48 → 1870.02] When will I be matched?
[1870.02 → 1874.82] I can't imagine this is real.
[1874.90 → 1876.34] This is a really basic site.
[1876.60 → 1878.26] There's almost no copy on it.
[1878.32 → 1879.46] They keep talking about the app.
[1879.58 → 1880.94] I'm going to see if it's available.
[1881.50 → 1881.82] Okay.
[1882.22 → 1885.82] In the meantime, though, this is where Trumpsingles.com goes.
[1886.34 → 1890.02] Maybe the account was suspended just because their traffic has been too high.
[1892.10 → 1893.30] That's possible, actually.
[1893.30 → 1894.74] Suspended from what?
[1894.74 → 1897.00] Contact your hosting provider for more information.
[1898.06 → 1900.98] I don't know, but make dating great again.
[1901.32 → 1901.56] Interesting.
[1901.56 → 1903.28] It's going to have to wait.
[1903.80 → 1906.00] Maple Match is not on Android.
[1906.34 → 1906.66] Okay.
[1907.40 → 1908.30] Maybe it's iOS only.
[1908.36 → 1908.58] That's okay.
[1908.60 → 1909.08] I got an iPhone.
[1909.32 → 1909.74] I got an iPhone.
[1909.78 → 1911.36] It did say something about iOS on there.
[1911.80 → 1912.02] Yeah.
[1912.90 → 1913.20] Okay.
[1913.28 → 1913.92] Maple Match.
[1915.10 → 1918.76] I feel like this is one of the most disjointed WAN shows we've ever had.
[1919.64 → 1919.88] Okay.
[1919.98 → 1920.46] Maple Match.
[1920.46 → 1920.64] Okay.
[1920.70 → 1921.02] Hold up.
[1921.14 → 1923.74] Jake is like, is the WAN show sponsored by Durex or something?
[1923.86 → 1925.20] Did you not hear any of that?
[1926.28 → 1927.88] He's avoiding using them.
[1928.12 → 1928.30] Yeah.
[1929.06 → 1931.92] I'm trying to not give my money to...
[1931.92 → 1932.40] Yeah.
[1935.72 → 1936.50] All right.
[1936.90 → 1937.30] No.
[1937.38 → 1941.38] Speaking of sponsors, though, we should probably do our sponsor spot.
[1941.50 → 1942.26] So FreshBooks.
[1942.60 → 1942.90] Yeah.
[1942.90 → 1945.28] Are you a small business owner?
[1945.52 → 1946.42] Are you a freelancer?
[1946.66 → 1950.08] Are you looking to get organized and get paid faster?
[1950.30 → 1955.14] And basically, are you frustrated with trying to track all your expenses and your hours in
[1955.14 → 1956.52] a way that is easy to understand?
[1956.52 → 1957.60] Like website hosting fees?
[1957.80 → 1958.00] Yeah.
[1958.10 → 1959.36] Like all that kind of stuff.
[1960.08 → 1960.48] See?
[1961.48 → 1967.40] FreshBooks is all about making your life easier as a small business owner or a freelancer.
[1967.66 → 1969.60] They've got simple to use invoicing tools.
[1969.74 → 1971.70] They let you track your time with their timesheet function.
[1971.70 → 1975.08] They let you manage your expenses and keep track of who owes you what.
[1975.42 → 1980.34] They also have a feature that tells you if your client looked at the invoice you sent.
[1980.46 → 1985.48] Like it's one thing if you're like, let's say you do electrical work or like small time
[1985.48 → 1991.74] contract, you know, handyman, handy lady, woman, whatever, handy person type work.
[1992.32 → 1996.60] And if you've got like one client per day at a time, it's relatively straightforward.
[1996.60 → 2002.14] But let's say you ran a yoga class out of your garage or something like that.
[2002.14 → 2005.58] And there's like 20 people in a class at a time.
[2006.06 → 2011.04] Being able to send out everybody's invoices and be able to tell who saw it.
[2011.56 → 2016.14] That way, when they come in for the next class, there's no, oh yeah, sorry, I didn't see it.
[2016.58 → 2018.22] FreshBooks takes care of all that stuff.
[2018.32 → 2020.02] And they even have a card reader now.
[2020.02 → 2025.56] So visit freshbooks.com slash when and enter when in how did you hear about us section
[2025.56 → 2028.72] when you sign up for your free 30-day trial.
[2028.98 → 2029.82] Try it out.
[2030.98 → 2036.98] Speaking of free 30-day trials, Squarespace offers, I believe it's a 14-day trial.
[2037.82 → 2038.98] Which is not 30 days.
[2039.36 → 2039.70] But.
[2039.86 → 2040.24] But.
[2040.24 → 2044.26] For those 14 days, you have 24-7 live chat and email support.
[2044.84 → 2051.48] And if you buy it for 365 days, you get a free domain thrown in for the entirety of those 365 days.
[2051.70 → 2052.02] Yeah.
[2052.40 → 2054.88] It starts at only 12 bucks a month.
[2055.28 → 2058.30] And you get, oh, I was going to do the free domain talking point.
[2058.48 → 2059.46] You're killing me here.
[2059.70 → 2060.38] Responsive design.
[2060.48 → 2060.66] Yeah.
[2060.74 → 2061.14] Wrecked.
[2061.14 → 2063.52] All of their templates feature responsive design.
[2063.62 → 2065.90] Your website scales to look great on any device.
[2066.78 → 2067.90] And actually, you know what?
[2067.92 → 2068.28] This is funny.
[2068.28 → 2074.66] My brother wanted to create a website for his small business that's actually doing really well.
[2074.80 → 2075.80] I had no idea.
[2076.62 → 2080.72] I got to get him on FreshBooks as well now that I think about it.
[2080.94 → 2089.98] Because basically, he breeds aquatic animals and plants for like aquarium enthusiasts.
[2090.72 → 2090.84] Yeah.
[2090.96 → 2093.00] My mom used to breed betas or whatever.
[2093.46 → 2094.78] So axolotls.
[2095.02 → 2095.84] Oh, he does like.
[2096.10 → 2096.38] Okay.
[2096.38 → 2098.48] Like a bunch of different stuff.
[2098.58 → 2104.72] Like I actually went to like the local lizard expo thing just to kind of like be a supportive older brother.
[2104.84 → 2105.92] And I was like, holy crap.
[2106.02 → 2109.26] There's like, this is sort of a bigger deal than I thought.
[2109.38 → 2111.74] Apparently plants are like huge.
[2111.74 → 2111.94] I didn't know that.
[2111.94 → 2119.26] It's like huge because there are lots of different benefits of having different plants in your aquarium.
[2119.40 → 2121.22] And I was like, oh, that's really neat.
[2121.28 → 2126.66] So anyway, as kind of like a late Christmas present, I hooked him up with a year of Squarespace.
[2127.14 → 2127.22] Cool.
[2127.40 → 2129.82] I actually paid for Squarespace for the first time.
[2130.16 → 2131.98] I have never paid for Squarespace before.
[2131.98 → 2133.78] But I hooked him up with a year.
[2133.90 → 2136.08] And he was like, oh, this is great.
[2136.54 → 2140.52] I thought you were going to, and I'm not going to name any names because that's not what this is about.
[2140.86 → 2143.26] But I thought you were talking about the other one.
[2143.44 → 2145.74] But I heard from everyone that Squarespace is the good one.
[2145.82 → 2147.40] So I'm glad that's the one you got me.
[2148.14 → 2151.46] And I was like, oh, well, I'm glad too.
[2151.46 → 2154.16] We only like endorsing the best.
[2154.30 → 2154.96] So there's that.
[2156.00 → 2159.04] But anyway, he was like, yeah, it's like pretty easy to use.
[2159.08 → 2161.82] So he's working on creating a site and everything right now.
[2163.18 → 2165.08] I kind of got sidetracked there.
[2165.08 → 2170.48] You can also have cover pages if you have a relatively simple site that you want to make, and you need like a one-page kind of design.
[2170.50 → 2172.56] Yeah, but like my brother wants to sell stuff.
[2172.72 → 2174.38] So he will use the commerce module.
[2174.38 → 2175.34] So he'll be using the commerce module.
[2175.66 → 2178.92] Which is nice and adjustable and set unable and whatnot.
[2178.92 → 2183.16] Anyway, free trial, 14 days, no credit card required.
[2183.30 → 2183.80] Try it out.
[2184.14 → 2191.28] You know whether you just want to have a presence for your local sports team that you coach or like a small restaurant that you help manage.
[2192.24 → 2199.06] There's a lot of people out there, like total cottage industry out there, of people using Squarespace as resellers.
[2200.26 → 2202.88] Basically, someone coming to them saying, can you build me a website?
[2203.38 → 2205.68] And they just kind of go, yeah, I'll build you a website.
[2205.68 → 2209.80] They use Squarespace, and they just customize it so that it looks really beautiful for them.
[2209.86 → 2216.62] And like you can be 100% transparent, and you'll have to be because that person is ultimately going to need to be able to sign in to admit it.
[2217.10 → 2222.70] But like, not a bad little biz.
[2222.86 → 2225.88] And if you're thinking like, man, I need to build something pretty beautiful.
[2226.18 → 2230.34] You should probably use offer code WAN to save 10% off your first purchase.
[2230.52 → 2231.06] Damn straight.
[2231.78 → 2232.42] All right.
[2232.42 → 2234.42] Nintendo signals the end of Wii U.
[2234.50 → 2235.08] Did you do that already?
[2235.46 → 2235.84] All right.
[2236.02 → 2237.04] There really isn't much to say there.
[2237.08 → 2237.70] Here we go.
[2238.16 → 2240.24] PCGamer.com is the original article here.
[2240.30 → 2242.20] It was posted by Top War Gamer on the forum.
[2242.94 → 2244.24] My balls are freezing.
[2244.98 → 2246.76] That was a very frozen ice pack.
[2246.88 → 2251.60] I generally haven't been leaving them in for like an entire day because I'm rotating between them pretty quickly.
[2251.60 → 2252.24] Okay.
[2252.44 → 2255.12] And that is like super frozen.
[2255.50 → 2258.04] Does that like add to the pain or are they numbed out?
[2259.86 → 2260.66] They're cold.
[2260.66 → 2261.34] Yeah.
[2261.58 → 2262.12] All right.
[2262.50 → 2264.02] Not very painful right now though.
[2264.10 → 2264.28] Okay.
[2264.32 → 2264.66] That's good.
[2265.08 → 2265.70] Gabe Newell.
[2266.12 → 2268.50] Valve is working on single player games.
[2269.06 → 2272.06] Open to revisiting the Half-Life universe.
[2273.02 → 2273.48] Yeah.
[2273.54 → 2279.90] So the title of like Gabe Newell confirms new IP in the Half-Life Portal universe might be a little bit of a stretch.
[2280.12 → 2284.18] It's a quote from his Reddit AMA that I had actually read.
[2284.18 → 2291.18] All he says is yes when asked if they were developing any fully fledged single player games.
[2291.18 → 2296.18] He actually said nothing about it very specifically being a Portal or Half-Life game.
[2296.26 → 2298.34] I just want to put that out there real quick.
[2298.34 → 2306.12] When asked in a different thread if they would revisit that universe, he answered in the affirmative.
[2306.74 → 2312.68] It's not Half-Life 3 confirmed, but it is possible that it could be a Half-Life related game.
[2312.76 → 2314.14] Not out of the question.
[2314.36 → 2314.60] Okay.
[2314.68 → 2315.64] I hadn't actually read that quote.
[2315.76 → 2316.06] That's cool.
[2316.06 → 2317.62] So there you go.
[2318.58 → 2325.86] They're using Source 2, but seeing that like Titan fall 2 was in Source 2 engine, that's not a bad thing.
[2326.10 → 2328.78] Titan fall 2 looked good, and it ran really well.
[2329.76 → 2330.86] This is pretty cool.
[2331.18 → 2337.08] The Sentry Small Form Factor case that we actually reviewed an early prototype of a few months back.
[2337.42 → 2340.28] Just for the few people that do care as well before we go here.
[2340.28 → 2348.10] He has also said that they're designing VR games first party, and they're designing a Knuckles controller, which is cool.
[2348.48 → 2349.20] Oh, fantastic.
[2349.36 → 2351.84] So to compete with the Oculus Touch.
[2351.98 → 2352.04] Yeah.
[2352.14 → 2355.90] So we've seen a little bit of that in my review that I did of the Oculus Touch.
[2356.10 → 2361.12] We saw a little bit of the Knuckles controller, but I'm sure it'll look a lot better than what I had called it.
[2361.90 → 2367.38] So the Sentry crushed their crowdfunding goal within a matter of like hours.
[2367.38 → 2370.32] And yeah, it seems to be well on its way.
[2370.40 → 2375.20] These guys are, I mean, I can't say that they won't sort of run away with everybody's money.
[2375.32 → 2378.64] It's an Indiegogo campaign and I, you know, can't personally guarantee them.
[2378.70 → 2382.32] But from my interaction with them, they seem like good folks.
[2382.32 → 2398.78] And the product that I had in spite of being very early, like a very early sample was something that I would have been, if I wanted a console in this, a console shaped PC in this form factor, something I would have been comfortable spending the money they're asking on.
[2399.14 → 2401.50] So great, great job.
[2401.56 → 2402.02] Those guys.
[2402.22 → 2402.70] Congratulations.
[2403.20 → 2403.68] Solid stuff.
[2403.82 → 2405.08] Huge, huge shout out.
[2405.08 → 2409.26] Seagate closing one of its largest hard drive manufacturing plants.
[2409.34 → 2409.62] Yeah.
[2409.62 → 2412.50] This is from Tech Power Up, posted by Numlock21 on the forum.
[2412.62 → 2413.40] Dun, dun, dun, dun.
[2414.30 → 2414.64] Wow.
[2414.74 → 2416.24] It's located in Suzhou.
[2416.54 → 2417.42] Hopefully I'm saying that right.
[2417.52 → 2417.78] China.
[2418.46 → 2421.78] The closure will significantly reduce the company's hard drive output.
[2421.78 → 2431.76] They're looking to optimize their production, reducing hard drive production capabilities from 55 to 60 million hard drives per quarter to around 35 to 40 million.
[2432.14 → 2432.58] Wow.
[2432.74 → 2435.74] And Seagate's laying off 2,200 employees.
[2436.42 → 2436.86] Wow.
[2437.12 → 2447.52] So basically what this means is not necessarily that Seagate expects a huge dip in the business for high capacity hard drives.
[2447.52 → 2450.46] Those, I mean, we met with them back at CES.
[2450.94 → 2461.02] Those, whether you talk to Seagate or WD, they are pretty bullish on shipping 10 terabytes plus hard drives to cloud storage providers.
[2462.24 → 2462.88] Facebook.
[2463.18 → 2463.86] Data centres.
[2464.40 → 2464.54] Yeah.
[2464.76 → 2465.48] Facebook, Google.
[2466.22 → 2467.54] Those are not going away.
[2467.92 → 2470.06] Hard drives are not going away.
[2470.06 → 2478.66] But what is going away much more quickly than, like, I remember talking to folks at WD and Seagate, you know, back three, four years ago.
[2480.36 → 2489.54] For consumers, as like the main drive in a computer or even as a secondary drive in a computer, they went away a lot faster than I think they saw coming.
[2489.88 → 2495.12] Well, like every single laptop basically used to come with like a 500 gig or one terabyte hard drive.
[2495.18 → 2496.92] And now they don't.
[2496.92 → 2502.20] And if they do come with a hard drive, it's a 500 gig or a one terabyte.
[2502.86 → 2502.94] Because.
[2503.40 → 2507.40] Not like that two or three range that should be kind of the high-end now.
[2507.56 → 2509.52] Like if we were still scaling the way we were.
[2509.60 → 2519.80] And the reason for that is that I don't, whether it's an end user or whether it's the manufacturers, they don't want to invest a bunch of money in the hard drive.
[2519.80 → 2532.36] And for most people, I believe one terabyte is that magical number where realistically, the majority of people don't need more than that.
[2532.92 → 2533.48] Because.
[2534.36 → 2541.04] Especially with a lot of stuff being cloud now, there's a considerable amount of people that don't really save much on their local computers.
[2541.04 → 2541.40] Yep.
[2541.60 → 2551.46] And there's an argument to be made for once you reach a certain amount of storage on a device that can fail, should that even be done?
[2551.58 → 2556.88] Or would it be safer to just take that 500 gigs or whatever and throw it up in the cloud?
[2556.96 → 2559.16] Now, the cloud has its own sort of issues.
[2559.26 → 2562.54] I personally don't store anything incriminating in the cloud.
[2562.54 → 2567.98] I'm having troubles finding a way to like to make a video that people will actually watch about it.
[2568.06 → 2569.34] So I don't necessarily know if I ever will.
[2569.72 → 2571.74] But Synology is doing some really cool stuff.
[2571.94 → 2572.18] Are they?
[2572.22 → 2573.20] For your private cloud.
[2573.62 → 2573.72] Right.
[2573.72 → 2576.74] So their NAS has always been solid enough.
[2577.08 → 2586.94] But now they're working on making things beyond that, like your own kind of hosted off your own server style Google Docs and Google Sheets.
[2587.04 → 2587.28] Okay.
[2587.34 → 2588.36] So it's not Google at all.
[2588.36 → 2593.28] But you can have collaborators and multiple people can be editing at the same time, and you can see people editing and stuff.
[2593.44 → 2597.60] And it's hosted off of your own server, Docs and Sheets and chat.
[2598.06 → 2598.50] Okay.
[2598.62 → 2603.88] So a Slack styled, they use that, and it looks like it.
[2604.58 → 2605.54] Now I...
[2605.54 → 2607.40] They should maybe use some different design cues, but yeah.
[2607.48 → 2614.86] I would like to see functionality like that in something like a Docker container so that it could be used across platform.
[2614.86 → 2617.10] But I know Synology does support Docker.
[2617.10 → 2621.62] So is that how they're implementing it or is it going to be like a Synology proprietary thing?
[2621.62 → 2622.76] I haven't played with it myself much.
[2624.02 → 2625.12] Well, I'll be keeping an eye on it.
[2625.24 → 2637.04] Because right now, to my knowledge, there still isn't a super simple like Dropbox ease of use equivalent way to back up photos that you take and videos that you take on your phone.
[2637.04 → 2645.14] It used to be that Code42 had like a personal cloud type product of some sort that had an app.
[2645.42 → 2646.50] Don't quote me on that, though.
[2646.50 → 2647.32] I don't remember who it was.
[2647.38 → 2649.42] But there used to be something that ended up getting discontinued.
[2649.42 → 2656.52] And it would be great if you could create something a little bit easier to use.
[2656.52 → 2658.08] Yeah.
[2658.94 → 2659.18] Yeah.
[2659.44 → 2660.26] Well, we'll see.
[2660.36 → 2663.16] I know right now, like, it's a little junky.
[2663.24 → 2666.76] Like, when you set up your thing, it doesn't have a friendly URL right off the start.
[2666.98 → 2667.18] Yeah.
[2667.34 → 2670.24] So it has like a really messy URL to get to your thing.
[2670.60 → 2671.82] You can change it.
[2672.34 → 2674.28] And you can like to make it so that it's clean.
[2674.36 → 2677.30] But you have to go through another one of their apps in order to do that.
[2677.40 → 2678.36] It's not automatic.
[2678.68 → 2679.08] Right.
[2679.08 → 2682.30] Because they're not like a low-end client company.
[2682.46 → 2684.66] They're like a you-know-what-you're-doing kind of company.
[2685.08 → 2687.08] AC says Google Drive.
[2687.90 → 2688.12] No, no.
[2688.16 → 2689.52] Google Drive is not the solution.
[2689.64 → 2691.84] I'm looking to store this stuff on my own thing.
[2691.84 → 2691.86] Privately.
[2692.26 → 2693.68] Apparently, OwnCloud.
[2694.34 → 2695.08] OwnCloud got forked.
[2697.44 → 2697.88] Yeah.
[2698.12 → 2699.26] Maybe I'll play around with it.
[2700.76 → 2703.32] And someone says Code42's Crash Plan Enterprise does.
[2703.32 → 2711.24] I called them like a few months ago back when I was looking into what I was going to use to synchronize our on-site server and our off-site one.
[2711.56 → 2717.80] I ended up with Beyond Compare running as a scheduled task with like a script.
[2718.64 → 2724.24] Because basically, I think they had removed that functionality and there were a bunch of other reasons that it wasn't going to work.
[2724.66 → 2730.64] But Crash Plan is a perfect solution for just kind of backing up an image of your hard drive off-site.
[2730.64 → 2734.66] Actually, this is kind of a cool thing that I hadn't really talked to anyone internally about.
[2735.14 → 2743.74] But as part of the server room reorganization, so it was, the old way was PANIC was SATA SSDs.
[2743.80 → 2743.96] Okay.
[2744.14 → 2748.46] And then it had a real-time synchronization server that was mechanical drives.
[2749.16 → 2755.70] So PANIC is moving to NVMe and the real-time sync is probably going to be SATA SSDs.
[2755.70 → 2766.26] And I think I'm going to repurpose that like 25 terabyte mechanical one as like a Crash Plan target that everyone who works here can use.
[2766.48 → 2767.48] Oh, that's cool.
[2767.56 → 2768.20] Which would be kind of cool.
[2768.24 → 2776.08] Because the way Crash Plan works is everything that people would sync to the office would be encrypted as like in a container file.
[2776.08 → 2782.40] So I would just create like a generic account that everyone can create their own accounts and then sync to.
[2782.64 → 2782.66] Yeah.
[2783.40 → 2790.66] And like I paid the $30 a month to freaking TELUS, and now I have unlimited data.
[2791.06 → 2791.54] Nice.
[2791.64 → 2793.10] So I would just sync like everything.
[2794.28 → 2795.44] That's the way to be, man.
[2795.70 → 2795.94] Yeah.
[2795.94 → 2803.66] The month after, because I kept on hitting my data cap like within a gig every single time.
[2803.66 → 2806.86] And then eventually they called me, and they're like, you're like metering yourself.
[2806.86 → 2810.62] And I'm like, yeah, I'm not going over because you guys charge a lot.
[2810.84 → 2811.82] They're like, would you like unlimited?
[2811.96 → 2813.16] We'll give you like a discount.
[2813.52 → 2813.84] Nice.
[2813.92 → 2815.04] And they gave me a discount for like a year.
[2815.12 → 2816.70] So I'm not technically paying $30 right now.
[2816.86 → 2817.16] That's cool.
[2817.18 → 2817.86] But it'll go back up.
[2818.20 → 2818.80] And I was like, yeah, sure.
[2818.84 → 2822.30] And the very next month it was like massive amounts of data.
[2822.98 → 2825.22] They're like, we don't regret this at all.
[2825.22 → 2827.50] I mean, you're on a fibre line anyway.
[2827.92 → 2829.86] And I think I'm the only one around on it.
[2829.96 → 2831.26] Realistically, it costs you nothing.
[2831.76 → 2833.14] So yeah.
[2833.66 → 2836.04] So many people are asking me this.
[2836.58 → 2839.24] Like for our setup here, why don't you build a SAN?
[2840.30 → 2843.58] Because I'm not going to build a SAN.
[2844.48 → 2847.58] Like everyone's suggesting that.
[2847.82 → 2851.28] Have you looked into the cost of a SAN?
[2851.72 → 2852.98] If you think what we have is expensive.
[2852.98 → 2855.74] Yes, the gear we have is like kind of expensive.
[2856.18 → 2859.88] I spent like $20,000 on NVMe SSDs.
[2860.02 → 2864.98] That is a drop in the bucket compared to what I would spend on a SAN.
[2865.22 → 2869.98] Not to mention having someone come in and set up, which would require ongoing maintenance
[2869.98 → 2872.80] because I'm not familiar with it, on a SAN.
[2873.00 → 2874.40] And for what?
[2874.40 → 2877.50] Why?
[2879.00 → 2880.30] Everyone's like, it would be way better.
[2880.68 → 2882.88] Way better in what way?
[2883.30 → 2886.12] We don't have 300 employees.
[2890.60 → 2894.68] No, I'm not going to run out and buy a SAN.
[2894.68 → 2897.74] It's storage area network, right?
[2897.84 → 2898.14] Yes.
[2898.18 → 2898.64] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2898.76 → 2900.84] So there's some people in chat asking what to say.
[2902.94 → 2903.34] Yeah.
[2903.52 → 2907.84] Basically, it uses different networking hardware.
[2908.24 → 2914.22] Like you would end up building some kind of like fibre channel type of like interconnect.
[2914.22 → 2916.56] You would have multiple boxes.
[2916.94 → 2922.18] You would have things like failover so that if one box just failed outright, the whole thing
[2922.18 → 2923.98] would keep on ticking.
[2924.24 → 2924.86] You know what?
[2925.14 → 2929.48] We don't have that many people, enough people to justify something like that.
[2929.70 → 2935.84] And the performance of that NVMe box for all the criticism in the video that just went
[2935.84 → 2940.78] up about how, man, it was, oh man, it was just kind of endless.
[2940.92 → 2941.60] Why didn't you do this?
[2941.78 → 2942.58] Why didn't you do that?
[2942.58 → 2943.72] This is stupid.
[2944.16 → 2945.84] There's a lot of things people don't consider.
[2946.00 → 2947.08] Why am I running Windows Server?
[2947.54 → 2955.46] Because we have all Windows clients and SMB 3.0 runs best on Windows.
[2956.06 → 2958.84] Had a lot of people asking why I was using hardware RAID.
[2959.16 → 2961.30] I am not using hardware RAID.
[2961.66 → 2965.34] There is no hardware RAID controller for 24 NVMe drives.
[2965.66 → 2967.44] What hardware RAID controller would I be using?
[2967.44 → 2973.70] I had a lot of people saying that the performance would be bottlenecked by the four 10 gigabit
[2973.70 → 2974.58] network connections.
[2977.32 → 2977.78] Why?
[2978.24 → 2979.02] I mean, sure.
[2979.12 → 2983.66] If I was hitting the whole thing sequentially from one client, then I guess I would need
[2983.66 → 2985.92] a 100 gigabit client.
[2986.42 → 2989.92] What would I need 10 gigabytes a second for?
[2989.92 → 2992.44] It's for multiple clients.
[2992.44 → 2998.14] When you have multiple clients, it is just fine to spread out over multiple network interfaces
[2998.14 → 3004.24] and especially when none of those clients will need more than one gigabyte per second at a time.
[3004.44 → 3007.30] All my clients are either gigabit or 10 gigabits.
[3007.30 → 3012.72] And the other factor to consider is that unless you are hitting it basically purely sequentially,
[3012.72 → 3015.78] you're never going to see 10 gigabytes a second anyway.
[3017.90 → 3023.78] And when we've got multiple people playing back, say, for example, red footage at 8K,
[3024.78 → 3028.54] each of those clients can do like 3 gigabits.
[3029.36 → 3030.42] It's pretty heavy.
[3030.62 → 3035.94] And then if someone's ingesting footage over there, then they could be writing at about 4 gigabits.
[3035.94 → 3044.32] And all of that stuff, it makes the interaction with the data more random and less sequential.
[3045.02 → 3046.80] So could there be a bottleneck?
[3047.06 → 3047.52] Sure.
[3048.00 → 3049.18] Am I concerned about it?
[3049.40 → 3049.80] No.
[3050.02 → 3053.44] So far, it has been operating extremely well.
[3053.68 → 3054.58] Thank you very much.
[3057.16 → 3059.10] The chat is like, oh my God.
[3060.26 → 3061.12] Linus is so mad.
[3061.90 → 3062.58] I'm not mad.
[3062.74 → 3063.54] My balls just hurt.
[3064.74 → 3065.22] Okay.
[3065.22 → 3065.40] Okay.
[3066.04 → 3068.76] ZTE Project CSX phone.
[3068.98 → 3070.94] Hands-free eye-tracking device.
[3071.60 → 3080.28] So this portion of the Indiegogo pledge goal that they have reached is everything.
[3080.80 → 3081.40] Kickstarter.
[3081.40 → 3081.92] Kickstarter, sorry.
[3082.36 → 3089.64] Kickstarter pledge goal that they've reached is everything that big companies need to know
[3089.64 → 3093.44] about crowdsourcing the ideas for your products.
[3096.02 → 3098.10] Because people have ideas.
[3098.82 → 3107.52] But that doesn't mean that they would actually pay money for a product that had that idea implemented.
[3107.52 → 3109.58] What?
[3110.28 → 3113.78] Basically, so they crowdsourced a bunch of ideas for this phone.
[3113.86 → 3117.08] And people were like, oh, we want eye-tracking scrolling.
[3117.08 → 3118.50] Oh, you don't mean the funding.
[3118.64 → 3123.44] You're talking about like they had like a site that you could go to and suggest features.
[3123.44 → 3126.08] So they crowdsourced ideas for the phone.
[3126.66 → 3127.30] And they've like...
[3127.30 → 3127.86] I didn't even know that.
[3127.90 → 3131.38] They've set themselves down on this path where they've committed to build it.
[3131.52 → 3133.58] And the ideas are terrible.
[3134.32 → 3135.78] Like they're just terrible.
[3136.92 → 3138.88] Scrolling based on eye-tracking.
[3139.20 → 3143.04] So pages should scroll automatically up and down or left and right based on movement.
[3143.16 → 3144.16] Absolutely hate it.
[3144.16 → 3144.88] Horrible.
[3145.30 → 3145.56] Terrible.
[3145.64 → 3148.70] Voice commands can be used to navigate between pages.
[3149.52 → 3151.52] Voice commands are already bad enough.
[3152.10 → 3154.68] I don't think voice commands need to get any worse.
[3155.64 → 3158.04] I swear Siri has gotten worse.
[3159.42 → 3163.72] I've been on the iPhone quite a bit lately because I've been waiting for an unlock code for my S7.
[3163.98 → 3166.14] A lot of people have asked why I'm wearing an Apple Watch lately.
[3166.62 → 3167.62] The next one.
[3167.72 → 3170.16] Sticks to walls and surfaces with self-adhesive case.
[3170.22 → 3171.68] That's going to get so gnarly.
[3172.08 → 3173.72] Just to bring back an old word.
[3174.16 → 3177.50] That's going to get really gross fast.
[3177.68 → 3179.66] And not work immediately.
[3179.96 → 3182.06] Dennis bought one of those iPhone...
[3182.06 → 3183.92] No, he has an S7 Edge, I think.
[3184.14 → 3187.04] He bought one of those cases that has that micro suction stuff.
[3187.06 → 3188.54] It'll work for a little bit.
[3188.70 → 3190.50] He's like, oh, Linus, this is so cool.
[3190.58 → 3191.84] You should make a video about this case.
[3192.30 → 3193.86] I was like, no.
[3194.40 → 3197.08] Because I'm plenty familiar with that stuff.
[3197.92 → 3201.38] And within like eight applications, it's not going to stick to anything.
[3201.38 → 3203.70] Not to mention that it barely sticks to anything in the first place.
[3203.76 → 3208.90] Anyway, unless you're sticking it to a window, there is no reason to use it whatsoever.
[3209.36 → 3211.02] Now, to be clear, I love that stuff.
[3211.26 → 3214.68] So I did a Handy TAC Under 100 where I featured that stuff.
[3215.24 → 3217.12] Oh, that would have been great for your sticky stuff one.
[3217.34 → 3218.04] But I'd already done it.
[3218.16 → 3218.26] Yeah.
[3218.54 → 3220.38] You don't have it as your case.
[3220.54 → 3221.66] No, I don't have it on my phone.
[3221.66 → 3222.66] Stuff on something.
[3222.78 → 3223.02] Yes.
[3223.22 → 3223.42] Yeah.
[3223.52 → 3234.18] So I have a strip of it on my nightstand next to my bed where I lay down any devices that I'm charging so that they can't get pulled off if I or one of my kids grabs a cable.
[3234.18 → 3236.76] So that's what it's for.
[3237.10 → 3237.26] Yeah.
[3237.90 → 3239.78] Or didn't you have some in your car before?
[3240.54 → 3248.26] No, that came on a Qi charging dock that ended up melting because I got an early prototype that was 3D printed.
[3248.54 → 3248.64] Yeah.
[3249.52 → 3250.32] That's hilarious.
[3250.54 → 3250.72] Yeah.
[3250.72 → 3254.36] It's expected to ship in September, and it has all the most generic specs ever.
[3254.48 → 3263.48] Qualcomm 625, 3 gigs RAM, 5.5 inch 1080p display, 3000 William hour battery, 12 megapixels plus 13 megapixel optical zoom rear camera.
[3263.58 → 3264.46] Yeah, that's not too weird.
[3264.46 → 3265.88] 2 gig storage, USB type C.
[3265.98 → 3266.68] Wow, I'm so bored.
[3267.50 → 3268.48] $200 though.
[3269.48 → 3269.78] Cool.
[3274.26 → 3274.70] Wow.
[3276.38 → 3277.20] Reddit user.
[3277.78 → 3278.28] This is cool.
[3278.28 → 3283.06] Also, it was posted by Good Tofu Friday.
[3283.24 → 3284.04] That's a great username.
[3284.80 → 3289.36] Reddit user posts a picture of an AM4 bracket.
[3289.92 → 3296.16] So here's the EK Water blocks AM4 versus AM3 bracket demonstrating that they appear to be compatible.
[3296.38 → 3301.42] Although I probably could have told you guys that from looking at AM4 boards at CES.
[3301.42 → 3306.38] It does look like AMD is keeping the existing mounting holes.
[3306.38 → 3308.40] Wasn't that definitely public knowledge already?
[3308.90 → 3311.34] I certainly didn't think it was a secret.
[3312.26 → 3313.42] But there you go.
[3313.56 → 3314.40] Reddit's happy about it.
[3314.42 → 3315.08] So good for them.
[3315.48 → 3315.88] Okay.
[3316.26 → 3316.94] You did it, Reddit.
[3317.98 → 3320.86] I thought, I thought, has just no one said it?
[3320.88 → 3322.36] Because we just all assumed that everyone else knew?
[3322.74 → 3323.18] Maybe.
[3323.90 → 3325.96] Because I thought, that's pretty funny.
[3325.96 → 3332.50] As rock is showing off a new desktop form factor.
[3332.92 → 3334.22] So check this thing out.
[3334.42 → 3337.00] So it spreads the IO out quite a bit more.
[3337.58 → 3339.90] It looks like we can put an MXM here.
[3340.30 → 3344.98] And I was, I honestly thought it was like a matter of time before we were going to see something like this.
[3344.98 → 3349.18] And I am super excited about the kinds of designs you could build with a board like this.
[3349.72 → 3352.86] So did memory and Front IO right here.
[3353.44 → 3354.38] Actually, wow.
[3354.84 → 3359.70] The closer I look at this, original article from an on-tech that was posted by, ah, my good friend, Dr. Sutras.
[3361.46 → 3363.98] This looks amazing.
[3364.84 → 3366.80] So, wow.
[3366.80 → 3368.96] I'm actually like super stoked on this.
[3369.66 → 3371.76] Basically, this would allow you.
[3371.84 → 3372.94] Tiny computer.
[3372.94 → 3386.84] To build effectively like a laptop thinness desktop with like a 7700K, 32 gigs of RAM, and like a GTX 1080.
[3388.86 → 3390.08] That'd be pretty sick.
[3390.60 → 3392.60] This would be bananas.
[3393.42 → 3394.42] Do you see any power connectors?
[3395.16 → 3397.24] So power is probably DC.
[3397.50 → 3398.74] So probably external power.
[3398.88 → 3401.78] If I had to guess, I would say that's a power in.
[3401.92 → 3402.36] Okay, yeah.
[3402.74 → 3403.38] That's probably it.
[3403.38 → 3406.46] I was looking for circular, and you can see a little bit of circular black on there.
[3406.52 → 3409.90] It could also be up here, based on that that's where this comes in.
[3409.90 → 3413.80] But I would assume central more so, so that it can feed the slot here.
[3414.52 → 3420.62] I'm also not sure exactly how they're planning to handle MXM cards that require external power.
[3421.04 → 3423.28] Like, it's possible that this is just one of.
[3423.90 → 3424.14] Yeah.
[3424.14 → 3429.48] But, oh man, an enthusiast grade desktop that's like, look at the size of this thing.
[3429.54 → 3433.70] It's like this big by like this wide with like a 1080 in it.
[3433.88 → 3437.70] Because like, I look at laptop hardware, and I'm like, yeah, that's just like awesome.
[3437.96 → 3440.56] I'd love to like to use the crap out of that stuff.
[3440.56 → 3449.42] Except that it's got a display and a keyboard and like a bunch of stuff that adds cost and complexity that I don't need.
[3449.42 → 3459.58] Whereas, oh man, like the kind of chassis you could build around something like this, where you could have like a mono block style cooler for the CPU and the GPU.
[3459.58 → 3462.88] So you can, man, I'm excited about this thing.
[3462.88 → 3464.80] Oh, there are some more pictures.
[3464.80 → 3468.92] So there's a good sense of the size right there.
[3469.44 → 3469.80] Yeah.
[3470.10 → 3475.16] And that does indeed look like power in, although I could be wrong.
[3475.72 → 3477.96] Look at all that M.2 on the back.
[3478.34 → 3480.48] That is BA.
[3480.48 → 3483.56] Very cool.
[3484.44 → 3485.24] Oh, here we go.
[3486.60 → 3487.22] What's that?
[3488.40 → 3488.70] Hmm.
[3488.82 → 3489.66] What are both of those?
[3491.30 → 3492.64] He probably says.
[3492.84 → 3493.88] Yeah, he probably says.
[3494.64 → 3495.88] Front bar, blah, blah, blah.
[3496.34 → 3496.54] Hmm.
[3497.04 → 3498.18] Yeah, DC and Jack.
[3498.46 → 3498.78] Okay.
[3498.96 → 3499.32] There you go.
[3500.34 → 3501.72] Yeah, so that looks fantastic.
[3501.90 → 3502.42] I'm excited.
[3502.42 → 3507.66] This could turn into some very, very cool form factors.
[3508.46 → 3509.56] I just want to see if there's any other.
[3509.70 → 3509.80] Nope.
[3510.02 → 3510.12] Okay.
[3510.44 → 3511.26] Stoked on that.
[3511.70 → 3518.74] I'm adding that to our, we have a we have like a weekly meeting now where we, where we
[3518.74 → 3520.86] like go through like what's cool, what's coming.
[3520.96 → 3521.84] Are you going to talk about the.
[3522.78 → 3523.14] Which?
[3523.76 → 3524.48] The three.
[3525.04 → 3525.58] The three.
[3526.14 → 3527.30] The two, three.
[3527.42 → 3528.02] Yeah, the three.
[3528.26 → 3529.52] I'm trying to not say anything.
[3534.86 → 3537.62] Oh, sure.
[3537.80 → 3538.06] Yeah.
[3538.06 → 3538.50] Yeah.
[3539.32 → 3540.68] So this is interesting.
[3540.68 → 3546.80] We have completed call for writers 2016.
[3546.80 → 3552.42] I know it's 2017 now, but we started it in 2016 and that's how the that's how the nomenclature
[3552.42 → 3552.78] works.
[3552.92 → 3553.06] Yep.
[3553.06 → 3557.52] And we are hiring three people.
[3557.52 → 3559.60] So a.
[3559.60 → 3561.42] I wouldn't say their names, but.
[3563.22 → 3564.24] Are you going to?
[3564.36 → 3564.38] I could.
[3564.38 → 3565.36] I could say first names.
[3565.94 → 3566.24] Okay.
[3566.24 → 3566.60] Yeah.
[3566.60 → 3566.64] Yeah.
[3566.64 → 3570.64] I mean, they've got their employee agreements where they agree to have their name and likeness.
[3570.86 → 3571.08] Have they signed them?
[3571.36 → 3572.68] Technically they haven't signed them yet.
[3573.00 → 3573.42] So maybe.
[3573.62 → 3573.86] Okay.
[3573.92 → 3575.20] So I'll stick with not names yet.
[3575.28 → 3575.84] Names soon.
[3575.84 → 3583.40] But we are adding three people to the writing team here, which is going to, I hope, dramatically
[3583.40 → 3589.16] increase the cohesiveness of the content coming out of this place.
[3589.16 → 3593.88] It's no secret that for a long time I've been overworked.
[3594.06 → 3599.80] It is no secret that Luke has his attention split between content and development of float
[3599.80 → 3601.90] playing club, our early access platform.
[3602.58 → 3606.20] And we've been in desperate need of help for quite some time.
[3606.28 → 3611.22] More help than we can get from Brandon with his camera reviews and Taryn with electric bikes
[3611.22 → 3615.36] And we've like never truly had a pre-production hire for Linus Actives.
[3615.36 → 3623.50] No, that was sort of the intent with John, but he bid into tech quickie and became the
[3623.50 → 3628.04] tech quickie guy in a way that, which is great in a way that no one anticipated.
[3628.18 → 3632.76] And he only rarely finds time to, to pitch in on the LTT side of things.
[3632.76 → 3640.04] So we said we were going to hire two to three, and we decided, uh, we decided to go with three.
[3640.14 → 3643.52] The decisions made, and those folks will be, two of them had to relocate.
[3643.52 → 3647.26] Um, but those folks will be heading out here sometime in the next, actually about three
[3647.26 → 3647.48] weeks.
[3647.62 → 3647.82] Yeah.
[3648.10 → 3648.30] Yeah.
[3648.40 → 3649.54] So that's exciting.
[3649.54 → 3653.34] Cause like over doubling the team essentially.
[3653.84 → 3660.76] And, and we've, we've grown these other sectors of Linus media group a lot and just never
[3660.76 → 3662.20] touched our side ever.
[3662.20 → 3662.64] Yeah.
[3662.74 → 3667.28] Um, and this doesn't necessarily mean that like, we're just not going to show up on camera
[3667.28 → 3668.86] as much or almost at all anymore.
[3668.86 → 3670.14] That's not the plan.
[3670.42 → 3673.50] Um, John has already done a bunch of line of executive scripts.
[3673.50 → 3679.42] Like if you've seen any of our console stuff, the Xbox One and the PlayStation four, Xbox
[3679.42 → 3681.44] one S and PlayStation four pro.
[3681.50 → 3682.00] Yep.
[3682.16 → 3682.94] To be more specific.
[3682.94 → 3685.10] Those were both largely John scripts.
[3685.24 → 3688.98] And what this will do, I've got a lot of people asking about more content.
[3689.10 → 3689.98] No, no.
[3690.50 → 3694.50] I do not intend for us to release more than a video per day.
[3694.50 → 3700.06] But what I do want you guys to see is more stuff like PlayStation four water cooling.
[3700.72 → 3701.58] Great video.
[3702.04 → 3702.10] Yeah.
[3702.40 → 3706.32] But a video like that is extraordinarily time-consuming.
[3706.66 → 3711.38] And the guys that we're bringing in will not only have more time, but they also have
[3711.38 → 3713.08] unique skill sets.
[3713.34 → 3713.58] Yes.
[3713.66 → 3720.44] So one of them I would consider to be kind of an all-rounder, um, kind of similar to me
[3720.44 → 3724.88] in that way, like pretty self-taught, except that he also has some coding experience.
[3725.62 → 3728.80] One of them has an engineering background.
[3729.18 → 3729.30] Yeah.
[3729.38 → 3730.62] Dude's got an engineering degree.
[3730.82 → 3735.60] So if we wanted to create a trebuchet for channel super fun, we finally have someone on
[3735.60 → 3738.86] staff who can have us not get killed while we're trying to do that.
[3739.34 → 3745.72] Um, the other one has over a decade of like it background.
[3745.72 → 3751.68] And like has, has like replaced electrical components on board and has gone around like
[3751.68 → 3756.64] fixing SNES and Nest systems and like all this other kind of cool stuff and is very interested
[3756.64 → 3757.44] and good at that.
[3757.64 → 3760.98] So we're bringing in three very different people.
[3761.40 → 3767.24] Um, at least one of them has a fair bit of experience with, uh, 3D modelling and 3D printing.
[3767.74 → 3772.20] Uh, so, so we're bringing in a bunch of different skill sets that are going to unlock a lot of ideas
[3772.20 → 3775.44] that we've had on the back burner for a long time and just haven't had the time.
[3775.72 → 3777.82] To learn how to.
[3778.02 → 3783.48] And this shouldn't just make it so that there's more like really awesome, cool, in-depth projects,
[3783.48 → 3787.66] but it should also free up Linus and I to do things like Scrapyard Wars.
[3788.12 → 3788.56] Yes.
[3788.70 → 3791.76] It's been a long time since Scrapyard Wars, uh, season four.
[3792.36 → 3795.24] It's, it's, it's difficult to do.
[3795.36 → 3798.78] It's extremely difficult to do when you have two people that can do the pre-production
[3798.78 → 3801.12] for projects, and you take both of them out.
[3801.12 → 3804.12] So I've got a lot of people speculating.
[3804.30 → 3805.98] No, Jerry is not coming to work here.
[3806.06 → 3806.88] They're all Canadian.
[3807.48 → 3810.62] So I'll put to rest any speculation about Jerry.
[3811.30 → 3813.78] Um, and because we just said they're all Canadian.
[3813.88 → 3815.22] It's not like, it's not Wendell.
[3815.22 → 3815.90] Yeah.
[3817.28 → 3817.46] Yeah.
[3817.46 → 3818.42] He's also American though.
[3818.70 → 3821.32] It's, it's not like we didn't, we didn't plunder like hardware connects.
[3821.40 → 3822.24] We didn't plunder anyone.
[3822.36 → 3823.06] These are all new guys.
[3823.22 → 3827.60] These guys are fresh blood, and we're really excited to bring them in and, uh, and, and
[3827.60 → 3829.32] really ramp things up in the next little bit.
[3829.40 → 3832.54] Just so everybody knows, Wendell like has a real job.
[3832.64 → 3834.92] Like, I don't, I don't know if people know this cause a lot of people.
[3835.26 → 3838.30] And I like the existence of level one techs.
[3838.32 → 3838.54] Yeah.
[3838.54 → 3842.40] And I like what he's doing over there and I don't, yeah.
[3842.54 → 3842.74] Yeah.
[3842.74 → 3845.48] If you guys actually could help me out a little bit, I'd appreciate it.
[3845.52 → 3851.68] If you can ask Wendell when the crap he's going to come on WAN show with us and talk about
[3851.68 → 3852.68] level one techs.
[3852.68 → 3856.94] Cause that's been, that's been on both of our calendars for quite some time.
[3857.00 → 3858.42] Just tweet that guy.
[3858.54 → 3861.80] Be like, yo, Hey, Linus is like, why aren't you on my show?
[3862.36 → 3866.26] And you'd be like, we want you on the show because it's been a long time.
[3866.74 → 3868.26] No excuses, Brad.
[3869.54 → 3869.86] Bra.
[3871.44 → 3871.72] Bra.
[3873.42 → 3874.22] What else we got?
[3874.30 → 3874.54] Bra.
[3876.66 → 3877.98] PC one year test.
[3878.04 → 3878.54] How's it going?
[3878.70 → 3879.54] It is going.
[3880.22 → 3880.64] It's going.
[3880.94 → 3882.40] I checked in on it a couple of days ago.
[3882.46 → 3883.08] Have you been back there?
[3883.42 → 3883.60] Yeah.
[3883.84 → 3884.08] Yep.
[3884.18 → 3884.62] It's going.
[3884.78 → 3885.34] They're all running.
[3886.86 → 3891.46] Next doc turns Intel's compute card into a two in one laptop.
[3891.82 → 3894.12] This was posted on the forum by Dawson.
[3894.12 → 3898.12] And the original article here is from the Verge.
[3898.54 → 3900.54] Okay.
[3901.26 → 3901.56] Oh yeah.
[3901.66 → 3902.26] This thing.
[3902.38 → 3902.84] Yeah.
[3903.36 → 3904.44] Looks pretty cool.
[3904.54 → 3908.78] So they announced the compute card at CES, which was back in early January.
[3908.98 → 3911.12] So a credit card sized computer.
[3911.12 → 3916.76] So this is the follow-up to the compute stick, which was a stick sized computer.
[3917.68 → 3919.54] And it's essentially a full computer.
[3919.54 → 3924.34] So it's got CPU, GPU, wireless connectivity, and it's designed to let hardware manufacturers
[3924.34 → 3927.00] easily add computer internals to smart devices.
[3927.00 → 3930.30] So it's all built around a single upgradable standard.
[3930.68 → 3934.34] So the next doc is one of the first products announced that looks to take advantage of the
[3934.34 → 3935.06] compute card.
[3935.60 → 3939.04] The company is listed as one of Intel's regional partners for the compute card.
[3939.10 → 3941.48] And it's a touchscreen device with two slots on the side.
[3941.64 → 3945.06] One for the compute card, which contains the actual computer of the device.
[3945.06 → 3951.66] And one for a larger custom USB-C module for swapping in and out ports and battery as the
[3951.66 → 3952.72] situation requires.
[3953.40 → 3954.38] I'm not a huge fan of that.
[3954.46 → 3956.00] I wish it kind of just had ports and a battery.
[3956.26 → 3956.28] Yeah.
[3957.36 → 3962.50] Apparently it can be converted into different form factors using a keyboard and kickstand accessory.
[3962.50 → 3968.38] So they hope that by separating the OS and the processor from the rest of the hardware, they can prolong
[3968.38 → 3971.88] the lifespan of the computer and help reduce the environmental impact.
[3972.48 → 3973.36] Very cool.
[3975.88 → 3977.12] What else we got here?
[3977.94 → 3980.50] I guess that's pretty much everything from my side.
[3981.78 → 3984.26] Opera Neon is Opera's new concept browser.
[3984.66 → 3985.50] So that's cool.
[3985.74 → 3985.96] Cool.
[3986.48 → 3988.30] And thanks for watching the WAN show.
[3988.40 → 3989.42] Do you have anything else that you want to say?
[3989.42 → 3991.20] Wendell's playing video games right now.
[3991.20 → 3991.60] Yeah.
[3991.76 → 3995.04] It's like he's not even doing anything more important than being on the WAN show with
[3995.04 → 3995.22] us.
[3995.52 → 3995.54] So.
[3995.62 → 3995.94] What?
[3996.26 → 3996.66] Okay.
[3997.10 → 3997.92] What's his Twitch?
[3998.02 → 3998.60] What's his Twitch?
[3998.90 → 4000.34] Team PGP.
[4000.42 → 4000.72] Okay.
[4000.94 → 4005.84] So Twitch.tv slash Team PGP.
[4005.94 → 4007.56] Guys, we got to fix this.
[4008.90 → 4009.24] Okay.
[4009.44 → 4013.04] So everyone get over there and like cause a riot.
[4013.92 → 4014.32] Okay.
[4014.80 → 4015.98] Everybody cause a riot.
[4016.20 → 4017.44] You can tell them I said so.
[4017.44 → 4018.54] No, don't tell them I said so.
[4018.64 → 4019.32] Actually, that would be better.
[4019.32 → 4025.56] I want to see a riot in Wendell's Twitch chat in the next 30 seconds, or I'm ending the
[4025.56 → 4025.84] stream.
[4027.26 → 4029.34] Actually, I'm going to end the stream in 30 seconds anyway.
[4029.58 → 4029.90] There it goes.
[4030.10 → 4030.38] Okay.
[4030.52 → 4031.18] Do we have a riot?
[4031.38 → 4031.62] Yeah.
[4032.12 → 4032.50] Okay.
[4032.94 → 4033.50] Very good.
[4033.72 → 4033.94] Okay.
[4034.10 → 4036.34] The riot level is about a four out of 10.
[4036.54 → 4038.54] I need to see about a 12 out of 10 here, guys.
[4038.60 → 4038.94] Come on.
[4040.36 → 4040.76] Riot.
[4041.16 → 4041.56] Riot.
[4041.96 → 4043.50] It's Team PGP.
[4043.72 → 4044.62] Team PGP.
[4044.62 → 4045.80] Let's get that link going again.
[4045.88 → 4046.12] Riot.
[4047.16 → 4047.64] All right.
[4048.42 → 4051.00] So thank you guys for tuning into the WAN show.
[4051.38 → 4053.38] We will see you again next week.
[4053.90 → 4054.90] Same bat time.
[4055.10 → 4056.04] Same bat channel.
[4056.14 → 4057.12] All that good stuff.
[4057.32 → 4059.14] We hope you guys had as much fun as we did.
[4060.32 → 4063.90] Huge shout out again to Focus rite for hooking us up on this audio gear.
[4063.90 → 4069.28] We're super stoked, especially now that we've figured out the sort of bummer that was the
[4069.28 → 4073.24] USB conflict, resource conflict that was causing our cutouts.
[4074.20 → 4076.08] Oh, this is really important.
[4076.20 → 4081.86] If you guys are not already subscribed to channel Super Fun, I'm linking that in the chat right
[4081.86 → 4082.14] now.
[4082.50 → 4084.22] All the episodes of Nerd Sports.
[4085.06 → 4085.62] Oops.
[4088.02 → 4089.30] Yep, yep, yep, yep.
[4089.60 → 4091.16] Go subscribe to channel Super Fun.
[4091.16 → 4094.66] All the Nerd Sports episodes are up, so go check them out.
[4095.66 → 4101.18] Also, right, if you want to get early access to Linus Tech Tips, Channel Super Fun, and
[4101.18 → 4106.66] Tech Quickie videos, Float plane Club does exist, so you can go check that out as well.
[4106.74 → 4107.86] I'll go ahead and throw you guys a link.
[4108.44 → 4109.58] Actually, it's kind of amazing.
[4109.74 → 4112.50] I mean, do we want to tell people, like, how many people are subscribed?
[4115.22 → 4115.62] No.
[4116.34 → 4118.72] Should we say that it's more than hundreds?
[4121.16 → 4123.52] I guess.
[4125.66 → 4127.48] So we've got a lot of people.
[4127.82 → 4132.26] I'm going to post this, post the link to where you can join the Float plane Club.
[4132.54 → 4134.28] The video and audio quality is quite wonderful.
[4134.54 → 4134.80] Yep.
[4134.98 → 4138.66] We've got a lot of great, great feedback from...
[4139.66 → 4139.90] Tremendous.
[4139.90 → 4143.62] Tremendously knowledgeable people that the video and audio...
[4143.62 → 4147.62] Actually, the audio is one of the biggest differences for me, because I'm usually watching
[4147.62 → 4152.10] on, like, a laptop or a phone, so a small display anyway.
[4153.40 → 4155.64] But listening with in-ears...
[4155.64 → 4158.40] One of those things that you've been asking for...
[4158.40 → 4162.68] We tried it, and it, like, works, but it's, like, terrifying for the servers, so, like,
[4162.84 → 4163.24] no.
[4163.48 → 4164.32] But later, yes.
[4164.38 → 4165.42] Does it have three letters?
[4166.72 → 4168.04] The first of which is H?
[4168.16 → 4168.36] No.
[4168.66 → 4168.92] Oh.
[4169.10 → 4169.62] Don't...
[4169.62 → 4170.20] I don't want to...
[4170.20 → 4170.52] I don't...
[4170.52 → 4171.72] Literally don't want anyone to know.
[4171.78 → 4172.36] Oh, okay.
[4172.48 → 4172.98] But it's two.
[4173.68 → 4174.20] It's two.
[4174.34 → 4174.90] Oh, okay.
[4174.96 → 4175.74] I think I know which one.
[4175.74 → 4176.28] Oh, wow.
[4176.28 → 4177.62] Oh, okay.
[4181.62 → 4182.34] All right.
[4182.44 → 4184.06] So, guys, go check out...
[4184.06 → 4185.46] Go subscribe to your channel, Super Fun.
[4185.78 → 4187.18] Go check out Flow Playing Club.
[4187.44 → 4187.66] Yes.
[4188.74 → 4190.48] Audio quality really is better.
[4190.58 → 4192.14] You guys are doing almost no compression, right?
[4192.90 → 4194.34] I, like...
[4194.34 → 4195.42] They change things all the time.
[4195.86 → 4196.30] Thank you.
[4196.56 → 4197.28] I appreciate it.
[4197.42 → 4198.04] I'm not complaining.
[4198.20 → 4200.04] I'm just saying I don't really know what's going on all the time.
[4200.56 → 4202.84] So, like, a while ago...
[4202.84 → 4203.64] Yeah, no, not really.
[4204.94 → 4205.30] Okay.
[4206.28 → 4207.44] All right.
[4207.52 → 4208.28] Good night, everybody.
[4209.46 → 4209.90] Bye.
[4211.68 → 4212.18] Oh, yeah.
[4212.20 → 4212.56] The outro.
[4213.00 → 4213.24] Oh.
[4213.46 → 4214.76] Which has no music, so whatever.
[4214.84 → 4215.22] All right.
