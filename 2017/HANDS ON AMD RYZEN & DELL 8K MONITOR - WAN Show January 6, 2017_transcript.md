[0.00 --> 3.58]  Okay, and theoretically we're live.
[3.82 --> 4.08]  Live?
[4.34 --> 5.28]  Live, I think.
[6.54 --> 7.94]  Not alive, just live.
[8.04 --> 9.20]  I'm definitely not alive right now.
[9.20 --> 9.48]  It's CES, man.
[9.48 --> 10.34]  Not even close.
[10.46 --> 11.46]  It is CES.
[11.72 --> 13.06]  Brandon, don't leave yet.
[13.16 --> 13.34]  Why?
[13.88 --> 17.62]  Because someone needs to check and see if the Twitch stream is actually working.
[17.76 --> 20.48]  Or we just talk to ourselves right now, like we have been doing all day.
[20.62 --> 20.88]  Yeah.
[22.26 --> 25.64]  No, I talked to, I had a meeting with Kingston.
[26.12 --> 26.40]  Okay.
[26.68 --> 27.56]  I talked to them.
[27.96 --> 28.18]  Okay.
[28.62 --> 29.46]  Were they alive?
[29.46 --> 32.08]  They were alive, but barely.
[32.46 --> 32.98]  That sounds about right.
[33.08 --> 36.16]  Yeah, and they were more alive than my contact at Corsair.
[36.56 --> 37.12]  Got it.
[37.20 --> 38.30]  Who was definitely not alive?
[38.40 --> 41.22]  Who made it through a presentation only to basically.
[41.22 --> 42.56]  I had a meeting with Kingston.
[42.98 --> 43.42]  Okay.
[43.76 --> 44.50]  Did I talk to them?
[44.52 --> 49.96]  It does actually look like we are indeed live, so people are saying it works, which is sort
[49.96 --> 50.56]  of amazing.
[50.98 --> 51.76]  And there you go.
[51.84 --> 52.84]  So here we go, guys.
[52.94 --> 54.10]  It's WAN Show time.
[54.22 --> 55.98]  I've got a special guest, Austin, here.
[55.98 --> 60.06]  And we're going to be talking pretty much CES stuff.
[60.44 --> 60.50]  Yeah.
[61.20 --> 62.48]  Luke is...
[62.48 --> 62.58]  Oh.
[63.12 --> 63.78]  Yeah, where is Luke?
[64.64 --> 64.90]  Oh.
[65.24 --> 65.90]  Hold on.
[66.28 --> 66.90]  Hold on.
[67.72 --> 67.94]  What?
[68.12 --> 69.76]  One person says Echo.
[70.80 --> 71.24]  So...
[71.24 --> 71.90]  Oh, you know what?
[72.02 --> 72.36]  You know what?
[72.40 --> 74.40]  I had the Twitch stream playing for like...
[74.40 --> 74.80]  Oh, got it.
[74.80 --> 75.46]  For like a second.
[75.56 --> 76.26]  I think that was it.
[76.42 --> 77.70]  So, yeah.
[77.86 --> 83.58]  So Luke isn't here because he has to get up at five in the morning tomorrow.
[84.02 --> 85.06]  That sounds exciting.
[85.20 --> 86.54]  Actually, probably around 4.45.
[87.04 --> 88.04]  I was up at six this morning.
[88.28 --> 89.16]  Does that count for anything?
[89.20 --> 92.60]  Was that for like a special event?
[92.76 --> 92.90]  Yeah.
[92.90 --> 93.20]  Oh, okay.
[93.30 --> 93.50]  Cool.
[93.56 --> 94.76]  Are you able to talk about that at all?
[94.88 --> 95.46]  Like, was it pretty cool?
[96.46 --> 96.78]  Yes.
[97.26 --> 101.20]  We got to do a test drive on a track with BMW with the i8.
[101.20 --> 104.04]  So I got to do some hot laps with an actual race car driver.
[104.42 --> 105.02]  It was...
[105.02 --> 106.80]  I didn't completely embarrass myself.
[106.88 --> 107.48]  I was really proud.
[107.68 --> 108.00]  Really?
[108.10 --> 110.30]  I almost spun the car once, but I was able to save it.
[110.94 --> 111.66]  Very nice.
[111.78 --> 112.08]  Yeah.
[112.08 --> 112.98]  So tell me something.
[113.18 --> 113.62]  Did you...
[113.62 --> 114.42]  What was your best lap time?
[114.88 --> 115.36]  It was...
[115.36 --> 116.90]  So you guys went to Speed Vegas, right?
[117.06 --> 117.36]  We did.
[117.36 --> 118.40]  Actually, I can pull it up.
[118.46 --> 119.96]  I think it was like 76.
[121.26 --> 122.22]  Tie game!
[122.80 --> 123.96]  Tie game, my friend.
[124.10 --> 124.82]  But what did you drive?
[124.96 --> 125.18]  Here.
[125.24 --> 125.50]  Hold on.
[125.54 --> 125.76]  Hold on.
[125.82 --> 125.92]  Hold on.
[125.92 --> 127.16]  Because I had a BMW i8.
[127.62 --> 127.94]  Okay.
[127.94 --> 131.24]  Let me just pull up my picture that I took.
[132.70 --> 133.58]  The suspense is real.
[133.72 --> 134.38]  I know, right?
[134.62 --> 136.10]  You're going to say like, I got a 55.
[136.42 --> 136.98]  No big deal.
[137.14 --> 137.34]  Okay.
[137.40 --> 137.72]  Here we go.
[137.76 --> 138.04]  Here we go.
[138.08 --> 138.38]  Hold on.
[138.52 --> 139.50]  So, wait.
[139.84 --> 140.56]  Where am I?
[141.34 --> 142.02]  Sebastian Linus.
[142.10 --> 142.24]  Okay.
[142.30 --> 142.68]  So there's me.
[142.76 --> 143.60]  I was in a Gallardo.
[143.88 --> 143.98]  Oh.
[144.70 --> 145.02]  76.
[145.50 --> 145.82]  No.
[146.04 --> 146.36]  78.
[146.70 --> 147.14]  Right there.
[148.00 --> 148.60]  So what were you...
[148.60 --> 148.88]  No, no, no.
[149.04 --> 150.20]  Your best dime is 76.
[150.52 --> 151.10]  Oh, best...
[151.10 --> 151.56]  Oh, 76.
[151.56 --> 152.28]  Mine was 76.
[152.60 --> 154.80]  But like, dude, your car had like twice as much power as mine.
[156.18 --> 157.46]  Why don't you cry some more?
[158.72 --> 159.22]  We're tight.
[159.32 --> 159.60]  We're tight.
[159.74 --> 160.42]  Wait, what was your top speed?
[160.48 --> 160.98]  What was your top speed?
[162.14 --> 163.16]  Mine was 134.
[163.26 --> 164.02]  I don't know what my top speed was.
[164.02 --> 165.08]  Yours probably was way higher.
[166.10 --> 166.38]  138.
[166.84 --> 167.18]  Oh, wow.
[167.20 --> 167.40]  Okay.
[167.66 --> 170.34]  Yeah, the Gallardo is not like the most amazing one they have there.
[170.40 --> 171.58]  I drove the Huracan as well.
[171.98 --> 172.90]  And the 488, man.
[172.96 --> 174.60]  That 488 was mean.
[174.98 --> 175.92]  Did you hear that thing?
[176.38 --> 176.74]  That thing...
[176.74 --> 177.32]  It sounded like a proper race car.
[177.32 --> 179.04]  It was like straight piped, right?
[179.12 --> 179.28]  Yeah.
[179.42 --> 180.68]  That's the one that was...
[180.68 --> 185.04]  So when they were doing the briefing, the safety briefing for us, that thing was ripping past
[185.04 --> 186.62]  on that straight stretch.
[186.82 --> 188.78]  And it was so loud, like inside the building.
[188.96 --> 189.18]  Right.
[189.32 --> 190.60]  We couldn't hear the guy giving the presentation.
[190.96 --> 192.08]  So we had a BMW 8.
[192.12 --> 193.30]  We had two BMW 8s.
[193.44 --> 194.84]  And they sound cool, right?
[194.94 --> 195.00]  Yeah.
[195.00 --> 196.32]  But it's a partially electric car.
[196.46 --> 198.70]  You could call it a hybrid even though it plugs in and everything.
[198.70 --> 200.20]  But the thing...
[200.20 --> 203.04]  It's like basically a three-cylinder motor with an electric.
[203.50 --> 204.82]  And it sounded good.
[205.26 --> 206.80]  I'm like, oh, it sounds like race car and stuff.
[206.98 --> 207.06]  Yeah.
[207.18 --> 208.04]  And that 488 went by.
[208.12 --> 208.70]  I'm like...
[209.22 --> 212.34]  It's like, no.
[212.60 --> 215.20]  Did you guys do a video with Corsair?
[215.48 --> 215.90]  No.
[216.14 --> 218.46]  So the Corsair event was bizarre.
[218.72 --> 220.66]  I can't talk about anything that happened at it.
[220.66 --> 220.90]  Got it.
[221.00 --> 221.50]  Got it.
[221.52 --> 223.84]  Besides there was a 488 and a Gallardo involved.
[223.84 --> 225.48]  Besides the cars.
[225.80 --> 226.06]  Got it.
[226.06 --> 226.26]  Yeah.
[226.26 --> 228.56]  And the cars were fun, which was cool.
[228.70 --> 229.08]  Yes.
[229.76 --> 233.02]  We've got people posting walls of text in the chat.
[233.12 --> 234.50]  Linus doesn't read the Twitch chat.
[234.88 --> 235.92]  I'm reading the Twitch chat.
[236.42 --> 240.12]  Also, you're going to take a little time out there, my friend.
[240.40 --> 241.12]  Yeah, that's right.
[241.48 --> 242.96]  Are you moderating the chat?
[242.98 --> 246.38]  Oh, I just moderated the chat.
[246.42 --> 246.82]  Whoa.
[247.12 --> 247.48]  Live.
[247.78 --> 249.16]  This is riveting content right now.
[249.20 --> 249.78]  That's right.
[249.90 --> 250.14]  Okay.
[250.32 --> 250.52]  No.
[250.72 --> 252.60]  Let's get into the real riveting content.
[253.18 --> 254.30]  Here is the intro.
[256.10 --> 258.08]  I actually don't know if the music's working.
[258.08 --> 259.08]  I think it is.
[260.02 --> 261.64]  I'm going to dance to it as if it is actually.
[261.64 --> 262.54]  Well, they can't see you.
[262.92 --> 263.30]  That's fine.
[263.42 --> 264.36]  I'm going to dance to it for me.
[264.36 --> 265.38]  I mean, I can see you.
[265.62 --> 267.30]  I can watch you dance, which is great.
[267.30 --> 273.58]  No, I'm banning.
[273.58 --> 274.24]  I'm banning.
[274.34 --> 274.94]  I'm banning.
[274.94 --> 275.04]  Whoa.
[275.54 --> 277.26]  I'm banning Han Solo Cody.
[277.68 --> 278.22]  Yeah, that's right.
[278.40 --> 278.86]  It's banning time?
[278.98 --> 279.48]  That's right.
[279.62 --> 281.64]  Dude, we've been here for like three minutes and you're banning people?
[281.68 --> 282.68]  It's banning time.
[282.86 --> 284.58]  It's like...
[284.58 --> 287.08]  CS has been a long, hard trek for Linus.
[287.18 --> 287.54]  Yeah.
[287.54 --> 288.32]  This has been rough.
[288.54 --> 289.60]  It's actually been...
[289.60 --> 290.08]  You know what?
[290.42 --> 292.90]  It's actually been our most organized year at.
[293.20 --> 293.82]  Year at.
[294.18 --> 294.38]  Okay.
[294.38 --> 295.82]  I mean, that doesn't mean my brain is still working.
[296.04 --> 297.24]  I mean, no one's is at this point.
[297.40 --> 298.76]  But it's been pretty organized.
[298.94 --> 301.64]  Actually, Nick did almost all of our scheduling.
[302.12 --> 302.38]  Nice.
[302.44 --> 306.04]  And I just kind of go where I'm supposed to be and take too long there.
[306.16 --> 309.70]  Dude, every time I've seen you, you guys seem to have everything together, which is impressive.
[310.50 --> 310.86]  Seem.
[310.86 --> 313.08]  So we forgot the batteries for our FS5.
[314.24 --> 315.26]  Like, straight up.
[315.44 --> 316.18]  No batteries whatsoever.
[316.48 --> 317.12]  One battery.
[317.40 --> 317.98]  And no charger.
[318.66 --> 319.86]  Can you get those locally?
[321.30 --> 322.80]  We're borrowing from Jay's Two Cents.
[323.10 --> 323.74]  Oh, okay.
[323.76 --> 324.30]  Oh, by the way...
[324.30 --> 325.50]  We actually have extra batteries if you need them.
[325.70 --> 331.88]  Massive shout out to Jay's Two Cents, who came through, unlike Austin Evans, in our time of need with an FS5 battery.
[332.02 --> 332.30]  Wait, what?
[332.72 --> 334.46]  Massive shout out, Jay's Two Cents.
[334.50 --> 335.32]  I just found this out.
[335.50 --> 338.06]  If I could have Jay's Two Cents here on the show instead of Austin...
[338.06 --> 338.46]  Get batteries.
[338.46 --> 338.76]  Get batteries right now.
[338.76 --> 342.44]  Instead of Austin, I would have, but the guy's too famous, so...
[342.44 --> 343.64]  You're stuck with me, unfortunately.
[343.74 --> 344.30]  So there you go.
[344.82 --> 346.24]  So let's talk show.
[347.18 --> 347.78]  Wait, do we have to?
[347.90 --> 348.72]  Have you seen anything?
[349.04 --> 349.44]  I've...
[349.44 --> 352.78]  Okay, so I've been here since Tuesday night.
[353.16 --> 353.84]  Same time as...
[353.84 --> 354.96]  No, I was here Monday night, I think.
[355.04 --> 356.66]  I've had almost no time to look at anything.
[357.12 --> 362.34]  I've been, like, all over the place doing stuff that has nothing to do with actual CES.
[362.34 --> 365.24]  We did a giant road trip around Nevada on Wednesday.
[366.08 --> 366.94]  Actually, with Jay.
[367.60 --> 367.88]  Okay.
[368.02 --> 368.72]  We did the whole thing.
[368.98 --> 371.14]  But I am almost completely in the dark.
[371.28 --> 373.64]  I've been able to walk around the show floor for, like, an hour.
[374.04 --> 375.82]  So why don't we structure the show like this?
[376.00 --> 376.22]  Right.
[376.38 --> 377.98]  I'll explain CES to you.
[378.10 --> 378.42]  Okay.
[378.62 --> 380.16]  And you can be, um...
[380.16 --> 381.02]  You can be, like, kind of...
[381.02 --> 382.36]  You're trying to impress me right now with CES.
[382.62 --> 382.88]  Yeah.
[383.02 --> 383.64]  Okay, let's do it.
[383.70 --> 383.96]  I'm done.
[384.14 --> 384.32]  Okay.
[384.58 --> 384.80]  Okay.
[384.98 --> 388.58]  So AMD, so original article here is from...
[388.58 --> 391.32]  I am really hoping that what I'm about to do right now is going to work.
[391.68 --> 395.04]  I think I just screen shared, but I'm not sure because...
[395.04 --> 396.14]  We're just watching the intro again.
[396.24 --> 396.74]  Because it's a hot...
[396.74 --> 396.88]  Yeah.
[397.32 --> 397.90]  It's like...
[397.90 --> 400.06]  And here we go.
[400.24 --> 401.06]  I think it's going to work.
[401.72 --> 402.08]  Okay.
[402.18 --> 405.44]  So the original article here is from PC World because our video is not up yet.
[405.44 --> 411.28]  But apparently, apparently AMD Ryzen...
[411.28 --> 411.80]  Not apparently.
[412.06 --> 412.76]  AMD Ryzen.
[412.88 --> 413.20]  Apparently.
[413.54 --> 413.94]  Is here.
[414.32 --> 414.74]  It's here.
[414.84 --> 415.42]  Is it really here?
[415.50 --> 416.10]  It is here here.
[416.18 --> 419.02]  Wait, when you say it's here, as in, like, can I go buy it yet?
[419.54 --> 420.48]  Well, not that kind of here.
[420.48 --> 421.10]  It's not here yet.
[421.18 --> 422.02]  It's not that kind of here.
[422.10 --> 422.32]  No, no.
[422.34 --> 423.20]  It's a different kind of here.
[423.30 --> 423.42]  Okay.
[423.42 --> 423.60]  Okay.
[423.72 --> 423.90]  Okay.
[423.90 --> 424.66]  So do you want to know the kind...
[424.66 --> 426.38]  Are you just going to be a smartass or are you going to...
[426.38 --> 427.46]  Do you want to know the kind of here it is?
[427.46 --> 427.70]  I guess I am.
[427.74 --> 427.90]  Okay.
[427.90 --> 428.54]  You invited me here.
[428.64 --> 429.76]  You should know what you got yourself into.
[429.76 --> 429.96]  Okay.
[430.00 --> 430.98]  So I invited you here.
[431.08 --> 431.26]  Yes.
[431.26 --> 432.90]  Which means physically in this location.
[433.06 --> 433.20]  Yes.
[433.20 --> 435.26]  So when I say AMD Ryzen is here...
[436.58 --> 436.86]  All right.
[437.12 --> 437.38]  Continue.
[437.62 --> 437.86]  Okay?
[438.02 --> 439.76]  That's QED right there.
[439.78 --> 440.18]  Okay.
[440.28 --> 440.58]  I got you.
[440.66 --> 440.78]  I got you.
[440.78 --> 444.74]  So basically, they had the same demos that they did from their live stream.
[444.94 --> 445.16]  Right.
[445.22 --> 451.12]  Where they had the Ryzen processor and the $1,000, 6,900K from Intel.
[451.54 --> 457.34]  And they had them playing a game, like playing a playback of a game.
[457.68 --> 457.78]  Okay.
[457.78 --> 460.64]  So it's running in the actual game engine, but no one has to sit there and actually play it.
[460.64 --> 464.70]  So they're playing back the game and they're streaming to Twitch on both of them at the
[464.70 --> 465.22]  same time.
[465.52 --> 469.54]  So it's like, you basically can tune into the Intel stream or was it like a split screen
[469.54 --> 469.78]  deal?
[469.96 --> 470.74]  Completely separate.
[471.06 --> 474.44]  One tower, one tower, playback and stream.
[474.80 --> 475.02]  Okay.
[475.06 --> 478.14]  So the idea is that not only can you game, but you can also stream.
[478.14 --> 482.02]  So it's kind of putting extra load on the processor and showing you that this can actually
[482.02 --> 482.38]  stream.
[482.76 --> 488.00]  So not only that, but what they're saying is that they're, I think they call it infinity
[488.00 --> 489.02]  fabric or something.
[489.02 --> 494.66]  The way that the eight cores communicate with each other makes their CPU able to multitask
[494.66 --> 496.72]  in that way, way better than Intel.
[497.64 --> 497.68]  Interesting.
[497.76 --> 501.34]  And so the practical demo that they're doing here is noticeably better.
[501.84 --> 502.12]  Okay.
[502.22 --> 504.56]  There's less delay on the Ryzen stream.
[504.98 --> 505.26]  Right.
[505.42 --> 507.52]  And there's less blocking and artifacting.
[507.52 --> 509.02]  Wait, so what do you mean by there's less delay?
[509.08 --> 511.76]  Because doesn't Twitch kind of introduce a delay built in?
[512.18 --> 513.08]  Theoretically, yes.
[513.08 --> 516.26]  I didn't think that that delay had anything to do with processing.
[516.44 --> 521.90]  So I'm not going to, until I've set up my own test setup where I take like my gigabit
[521.90 --> 524.60]  pipe and I set it up at home.
[524.86 --> 529.30]  Well, I don't have a gigabyte pipe at home, but I'm just going to have a moment of sadness
[529.30 --> 529.60]  here.
[530.66 --> 530.78]  Okay.
[530.78 --> 537.20]  So I set it up in the studio and I see it for myself.
[537.42 --> 537.62]  Right.
[537.70 --> 540.22]  That one of the streams is more or less delayed than the other.
[540.32 --> 543.26]  But what was noticeable was the image quality.
[543.80 --> 547.44]  For some reason, the AMD stream didn't have as much blocking.
[548.04 --> 551.84]  Now with that said, what I don't know, so I did open up all the boxes.
[552.10 --> 552.28]  Okay.
[552.28 --> 553.38]  I opened up the machines.
[553.56 --> 554.92]  It was legit, at least hardware wise.
[555.06 --> 555.42]  Yes.
[555.56 --> 555.76]  Okay.
[555.76 --> 559.40]  The hardware was legit, but I don't know if there could have been any variability in the
[559.40 --> 559.58]  internet.
[559.58 --> 561.62]  Did you see like bit rate or anything like that?
[561.72 --> 563.40]  Like what their backend settings were?
[563.62 --> 565.16]  So I need to validate it for myself.
[565.42 --> 566.62]  But it's an interesting demo.
[566.78 --> 567.84]  But it's an interesting demo.
[567.96 --> 568.08]  Yeah.
[568.28 --> 573.14]  And the obvious question is, well, why not just use NVNC?
[573.28 --> 575.22]  Like why not use your video card to encode?
[575.66 --> 578.60]  And the answer to that is CPU encoding looks better, which is true.
[578.60 --> 584.56]  So if you have a processor that can game and CPU encode at the same time, then sure.
[584.70 --> 584.86]  Great.
[585.48 --> 585.72]  Okay.
[586.50 --> 587.78]  So then they have another demo.
[588.12 --> 592.28]  They're running Battlefield 1, 4K, with GTX Titan XP.
[593.06 --> 595.80]  Which is like, okay, that sounds about right.
[595.88 --> 600.10]  I mean, given that Nvidia didn't give the cards to them, I guess AMD actually ran out there
[600.10 --> 603.64]  and spent like, you know, over a G twice.
[603.82 --> 607.82]  I mean, I feel like AMD might end up buying a couple of Nvidia cards and vice versa from time
[607.82 --> 608.26]  to time.
[608.38 --> 608.86]  It might happen.
[608.86 --> 609.56]  From time to time.
[609.74 --> 609.82]  Maybe.
[610.04 --> 611.82]  They might make it into the labs, you know.
[612.04 --> 612.40]  That's up.
[614.04 --> 617.94]  But they, so they had Ryzen and a 6900K playing Battlefield 1.
[618.36 --> 619.48]  And I'll say this.
[619.98 --> 623.70]  The frame rates looked a little slower on Ryzen.
[624.36 --> 625.44]  Was there an FPS counter?
[625.70 --> 625.90]  Yes.
[625.90 --> 626.74]  Or was it just like, okay.
[627.12 --> 627.34]  Yeah.
[627.54 --> 628.28]  FPS counter.
[628.46 --> 629.06]  They had it in the corner.
[629.20 --> 630.68]  So it was free to touch.
[630.98 --> 631.16]  Right.
[631.16 --> 634.18]  You could navigate the tank exactly in the same spot.
[634.32 --> 637.02]  And you could kind of move it around and see how the dips went.
[637.02 --> 637.94]  You could fire the gun.
[638.02 --> 638.70]  See how it dips.
[638.86 --> 638.98]  Yeah.
[639.54 --> 641.76]  And Ryzen mostly held its own.
[642.26 --> 642.50]  Okay.
[642.56 --> 645.34]  It was like 96 to 97% of the way there.
[645.60 --> 646.06]  That's close.
[646.38 --> 649.68]  And they don't have their dynamic clock boosting on yet.
[650.06 --> 650.42]  Oh, right.
[650.46 --> 653.12]  Because like, wasn't the first demo they were showing something like, it was like clocked
[653.12 --> 654.92]  at like three gigahertz or whatever compared to Broadwell?
[655.08 --> 655.42]  Right.
[655.42 --> 658.52]  So now they've got it clocked at 3.4.
[659.02 --> 659.30]  Okay.
[659.48 --> 660.34]  And that's all eight cores.
[660.52 --> 661.38]  And that's all eight cores.
[661.54 --> 667.20]  But the rumor is that it's going to boost maybe another 300 megahertz higher than that.
[667.42 --> 667.66]  Okay.
[668.96 --> 670.40]  So that's interesting.
[670.62 --> 670.82]  This is interesting.
[670.96 --> 674.40]  So do we have an idea of what price is going to be on this thing?
[674.52 --> 674.74]  No.
[675.26 --> 675.52]  Okay.
[675.52 --> 679.24]  So this could be really impressive or just kind of whatever.
[679.60 --> 683.16]  So there's a couple different ways that AMD can attack this.
[683.38 --> 683.44]  Yeah.
[683.56 --> 686.56]  They can either go the route that we've seen.
[686.66 --> 687.20]  Because, okay.
[687.38 --> 693.36]  How many years has it been since we've had a graphics card that has come in and been like
[693.36 --> 696.20]  60% as fast as the flagship?
[696.52 --> 697.48]  Or then like, okay.
[697.62 --> 697.80]  Okay.
[697.80 --> 702.42]  Let's say it's like 90% as fast as like the next one from the team, other team.
[702.66 --> 702.92]  Right.
[703.02 --> 703.12]  Right.
[703.16 --> 705.40]  And it comes in at like 70% of the price.
[705.56 --> 705.74]  Right.
[705.94 --> 706.52]  It doesn't happen.
[706.60 --> 707.26]  It doesn't happen anymore.
[707.44 --> 707.56]  Yeah.
[707.74 --> 709.78]  I mean, 480 was like pretty good.
[709.86 --> 712.64]  But then Nvidia countered with the three gig 1060.
[712.92 --> 715.34]  And it all kind of, the stack made sense again.
[715.42 --> 716.20]  Your laptop just turned off.
[716.30 --> 717.60]  Like almost immediately.
[718.64 --> 720.40]  I thought the toll stream just crashed.
[720.64 --> 720.80]  Sorry.
[720.90 --> 721.08]  No.
[721.18 --> 721.36]  Go ahead.
[721.36 --> 721.60]  Go ahead.
[721.64 --> 722.06]  All good.
[724.02 --> 724.74]  Jeez, man.
[724.74 --> 727.92]  I thought that screen just went like black a little too fast.
[728.04 --> 728.14]  Yeah.
[728.26 --> 728.46]  Sorry.
[728.56 --> 728.68]  Sorry.
[728.72 --> 728.86]  Yeah.
[728.96 --> 729.80]  I totally got you.
[729.92 --> 730.10]  Right.
[730.52 --> 733.04]  So they're pretty much going to price this whatever they want to.
[733.14 --> 735.94]  And if they think that they can come close to Intel performance, they might as well come
[735.94 --> 736.82]  close to Intel price.
[736.98 --> 743.54]  But if they do that, what do all the AMD fans who have been waiting all this time for AMD
[743.54 --> 746.96]  to come up with something competitive, what do they have to show for their patience?
[747.42 --> 753.24]  So AMD is in a position where they have to be aggressive to please their fans, I think.
[753.46 --> 753.94]  I feel.
[754.74 --> 758.68]  But if they go too aggressive, they force Intel to react.
[759.82 --> 765.02]  So AMD needs to kind of be like a little bit better.
[765.38 --> 769.66]  And it's almost like if they give it away, they're actually going to screw themselves.
[770.64 --> 771.14]  So what do you think?
[771.26 --> 774.20]  So say we're getting 90% of the performance with Horizon, right?
[774.28 --> 775.22]  Just throwing a number out there.
[775.32 --> 776.06]  So throw a random number.
[776.12 --> 776.22]  Sure.
[776.44 --> 778.74]  So what if that's like 80% the price?
[779.20 --> 781.16]  I think that's pretty close.
[781.16 --> 781.56]  Okay.
[781.78 --> 783.18]  I think maybe even...
[783.18 --> 785.54]  So I think it'll be like 80% of the price on the chip.
[785.72 --> 787.40]  And I think the board's going to be a little cheaper.
[787.74 --> 787.96]  Yeah.
[788.14 --> 788.58]  I agree with that.
[788.60 --> 790.28]  Because Intel charges a lot for a chipset.
[790.32 --> 792.20]  The boards were also showing a CES, right?
[792.40 --> 792.80]  Yes.
[792.80 --> 795.82]  So the platform, very interesting.
[796.82 --> 798.58]  I thought...
[798.58 --> 802.28]  Because AMD said, look, we're making a high-end CPU, damn it.
[802.84 --> 804.00]  And so we're going high-end.
[804.00 --> 810.64]  But the reality of it is that there's a lot of stuff about HEDT, high-end desktop, Intel's
[810.64 --> 815.40]  2011 3 platform, that makes no sense, even in an enthusiast computer.
[815.84 --> 816.08]  Sure.
[816.30 --> 817.90]  Do you need 40 PCI Express lanes?
[818.02 --> 819.52]  What are you hooking up to your PCI Express lanes?
[820.22 --> 821.24]  18 graphics cards.
[821.44 --> 821.62]  Right.
[821.70 --> 822.04]  Exactly.
[822.24 --> 822.38]  Okay.
[822.72 --> 825.96]  So do you need all of these PCI Express lanes?
[827.96 --> 828.62]  Probably not.
[828.62 --> 834.20]  For certain super-end applications, but I feel like 98% of people never actually utilize
[834.20 --> 834.30]  that.
[834.30 --> 834.58]  That's right.
[834.98 --> 838.82]  So Intel's HEDT has server DNA.
[839.28 --> 839.52]  Right.
[839.96 --> 840.14]  Right.
[840.74 --> 841.10]  Exactly.
[841.10 --> 841.92]  That's where it actually makes sense.
[841.94 --> 843.34]  That's where that stuff makes sense.
[843.84 --> 851.64]  But then Intel's desktop platform, with its 16 plus 4 PCI Express lanes, as soon as you
[851.64 --> 856.64]  put a graphics in there, it's like all you got left is kind of four lanes for your...
[856.64 --> 858.02]  Now we've got NVMe storage.
[858.02 --> 858.80]  Yeah, exactly.
[858.94 --> 859.16]  That's it.
[859.18 --> 860.36]  We've got SATA drives.
[860.46 --> 863.72]  We've got, like, maybe you want to throw in a couple more PCIe cards.
[864.34 --> 867.32]  You know, motherboards are starting to ship with 10 gigabit networking on them.
[867.38 --> 867.62]  Right.
[867.74 --> 869.54]  That uses a significant amount of bandwidth.
[869.80 --> 869.96]  Right.
[870.18 --> 874.56]  So I feel like Intel's consumer is almost too consumer.
[875.12 --> 875.42]  Sure.
[875.58 --> 875.80]  Sure.
[875.86 --> 876.72]  No, I can totally agree with that.
[876.82 --> 876.88]  Yeah.
[876.88 --> 879.54]  So AMD went right in the middle.
[879.94 --> 880.18]  Okay.
[880.72 --> 883.32]  24 PCIe lanes off the CPU.
[884.20 --> 884.28]  All right.
[884.28 --> 886.46]  So that's 16 dedicated for graphics.
[886.68 --> 886.78]  Yeah.
[886.78 --> 890.34]  Another four dedicated for NVMe storage.
[890.60 --> 890.82]  Okay.
[890.94 --> 895.92]  And another four to the chipset to handle your LAN, USB 3.1 Gen 2.
[896.12 --> 899.00]  So when you say dedicated, it's not specifically dedicated, right?
[899.20 --> 900.06]  I believe it is.
[900.20 --> 900.70]  Is it really?
[900.70 --> 902.18]  Because Intel is set up somewhat similarly.
[902.30 --> 904.02]  That's what DMI 3.0 is.
[904.08 --> 904.26]  Right.
[904.26 --> 908.86]  It's basically PCIe that goes from the CPU to the chipset that acts as a communications hub.
[908.86 --> 917.24]  So AMD has gone and positioned Ryzen and their 370X, I think, is the highest end chipset.
[917.42 --> 917.56]  Yeah.
[917.92 --> 919.16]  Kind of like dead center.
[920.40 --> 920.72]  Okay.
[921.50 --> 921.82]  Okay.
[922.08 --> 922.92]  So that makes sense.
[923.02 --> 925.50]  I feel like, I mean, first of all, they've got eight cores.
[925.92 --> 926.12]  Yeah.
[926.12 --> 930.26]  And it seems like these eight cores are going to be a pretty decent step up over what we've
[930.26 --> 930.82]  had in the past.
[930.84 --> 931.92]  From AMD, that's for sure.
[931.92 --> 932.20]  Yeah.
[932.36 --> 937.64]  So it's like, it makes sense that with more cores, there's a little bit more room kind
[937.64 --> 940.92]  of in the middle for them to kind of aim for the other features like PCIe.
[941.02 --> 941.44]  That's right.
[941.78 --> 943.06]  So I'm done with that.
[943.58 --> 944.62]  I think it makes sense.
[944.90 --> 945.00]  Yeah.
[945.36 --> 946.58]  And they're giving us a lot.
[946.66 --> 949.48]  They're five different chipsets, which I thought was a little lower at the top.
[949.60 --> 949.70]  Yeah.
[949.76 --> 953.50]  So there's a super low power one designed for very small form factor stuff.
[953.62 --> 953.82]  Okay.
[954.00 --> 959.12]  There's two that would be considered high end and enthusiast level that will enable overclocking.
[959.14 --> 959.72]  Ah, okay.
[959.72 --> 963.50]  So they're going a similar, and then there's two more, like a mainstream and a business
[963.50 --> 964.24]  one or something like that.
[964.24 --> 964.52]  Sure, sure.
[964.52 --> 965.78]  I forget exactly what they all are.
[965.98 --> 974.48]  But they're going a similar route to Intel on the whole, like, you know, pick your page
[974.48 --> 981.12]  and pick your decoder ring and unlock the overclocking, except that every Ryzen CPU is unlocked.
[982.38 --> 984.42]  So you don't have to pick a special CPU.
[984.80 --> 984.98]  Okay.
[984.98 --> 986.50]  You just have to buy a special board.
[987.26 --> 987.60]  Okay.
[987.74 --> 988.34]  I'm done with that.
[988.46 --> 988.88]  I'm done with that.
[988.88 --> 990.00]  Like, why not, right?
[990.50 --> 991.58]  I agree with that move.
[991.74 --> 992.18]  Yeah, absolutely.
[992.36 --> 996.66]  Because the reality of it is, is even on the Intel side, if you're going to overclock,
[996.94 --> 998.86]  you should be buying a decent board anyway.
[998.98 --> 999.36]  Of course.
[999.50 --> 999.86]  Absolutely.
[1000.18 --> 1000.30]  Yeah.
[1000.36 --> 1005.80]  And any decent board is going to have a Z series chipset, or X, as it were, anyway.
[1006.24 --> 1006.38]  Yeah.
[1006.60 --> 1008.38]  So don't lock down the CPU.
[1008.66 --> 1013.06]  You buy whatever CPU you want, and then you buy a decent board, which presumably will have
[1013.06 --> 1014.62]  a top tier chipset, and you overclock it.
[1014.80 --> 1015.32]  Yeah, absolutely.
[1015.32 --> 1015.38]  Absolutely.
[1015.86 --> 1020.66]  So far, it looks like the approach is pretty consumer friendly.
[1020.90 --> 1021.14]  Yeah.
[1021.38 --> 1021.56]  Yeah.
[1022.30 --> 1027.62]  I mean, you know, I'm not one to have a ton of faith in any corporation.
[1027.62 --> 1030.36]  And I know a corporation is still made up of people.
[1030.88 --> 1036.32]  But I'm not one to have much faith in a corporation, so I'm saying an entity with a board of directors.
[1036.32 --> 1042.48]  Because boards of directors are not, and shareholders, those are not the real people that you interact
[1042.48 --> 1042.80]  with.
[1042.88 --> 1043.08]  Right, of course.
[1043.08 --> 1044.14]  Or that I interact with.
[1044.16 --> 1047.00]  Those are the people who need to make sure that their next bonus is even bigger than the
[1047.00 --> 1047.34]  last one.
[1047.38 --> 1047.70]  That's right.
[1047.78 --> 1049.12]  These are money people.
[1049.32 --> 1056.28]  These are not human interaction with customers, and with influencers, and with resellers, people.
[1056.28 --> 1063.08]  So I have very little faith generally in a corporation to act in a consumer friendly manner.
[1063.24 --> 1063.44]  Absolutely.
[1063.68 --> 1071.96]  Once they have a product that they can sell for $722, I expect them to charge $724 with
[1071.96 --> 1073.24]  a $2 mail-in rebate.
[1073.82 --> 1074.08]  Okay?
[1075.12 --> 1076.08]  That's my expectation.
[1076.08 --> 1076.72]  Sign me up for that.
[1076.82 --> 1077.34]  Sign me up for that.
[1077.42 --> 1077.52]  Yeah.
[1077.52 --> 1084.08]  So it is refreshing for me to see that this thing is competitive.
[1084.48 --> 1084.70]  Yes.
[1084.82 --> 1087.10]  And that they're not necessarily going to grab the opportunity.
[1087.18 --> 1088.66]  With that said, we know nothing about pricing.
[1089.06 --> 1089.34]  Right.
[1089.44 --> 1090.78]  Do we have a rough release date at all?
[1091.64 --> 1096.46]  I think a rough release date is sometime in Q1.
[1096.98 --> 1097.34]  Oh, okay.
[1097.38 --> 1098.28]  So we're pretty close.
[1098.80 --> 1101.46]  Well, they had not only like two demo systems.
[1101.96 --> 1102.36]  Okay.
[1102.36 --> 1108.76]  So they had a lineup of 15 systems from like Origin PC and like this weird like Chinese
[1108.76 --> 1109.78]  computer brand.
[1109.86 --> 1110.48]  I'd never heard of it.
[1110.52 --> 1111.64]  It had like this crazy case.
[1111.74 --> 1113.76]  Like they had a bunch of partner systems.
[1114.04 --> 1114.22]  Right.
[1114.32 --> 1117.30]  They had Ryzen running in like the Vega demo.
[1118.00 --> 1118.36]  Okay.
[1118.56 --> 1118.84]  Okay.
[1118.96 --> 1119.94]  There was a Vega demo.
[1119.94 --> 1120.28]  Oh.
[1121.28 --> 1128.22]  It is my belief at this time that I am the only one who has actually touched Vega.
[1128.72 --> 1129.52]  You actually touched it?
[1129.60 --> 1130.24]  Here at the show.
[1131.28 --> 1131.92]  Not only-
[1131.92 --> 1132.44]  Did you drop it?
[1133.04 --> 1133.30]  No.
[1133.44 --> 1134.12]  Well, you know what?
[1134.22 --> 1134.82]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[1134.82 --> 1136.44]  I did drop the chip.
[1136.64 --> 1137.30]  You actually did?
[1137.32 --> 1138.10]  There's a dead chip.
[1138.26 --> 1139.36]  I did drop the chip.
[1139.48 --> 1140.78]  Was it dead before or after you dropped it?
[1140.86 --> 1141.20]  Before.
[1141.30 --> 1142.48]  It wasn't even attached to a GP.
[1142.60 --> 1142.96]  Okay.
[1143.04 --> 1143.38]  Okay.
[1143.38 --> 1143.42]  Okay.
[1143.76 --> 1145.02]  So I was playing with the chip.
[1145.10 --> 1145.54]  I was holding it.
[1145.56 --> 1146.28]  I was looking at it.
[1146.88 --> 1149.12]  And it like fell out of my hands.
[1149.36 --> 1149.90]  No one was looking.
[1150.00 --> 1150.40]  I picked it up.
[1150.40 --> 1150.46]  Sure.
[1150.46 --> 1150.54]  Sure.
[1150.62 --> 1150.90]  Of course.
[1151.06 --> 1151.12]  Yeah.
[1151.18 --> 1151.42]  Naturally.
[1151.42 --> 1151.96]  Camera wasn't rolling.
[1152.32 --> 1152.68]  So it wasn't-
[1152.68 --> 1152.82]  Sure.
[1152.82 --> 1154.60]  I wasn't like staging it to be funny.
[1154.78 --> 1155.30]  It was just-
[1155.30 --> 1156.00]  I was like, oh, shoot.
[1156.12 --> 1156.92]  I dropped it.
[1156.92 --> 1157.88]  Crap.
[1158.38 --> 1159.42]  I've never done that before ever.
[1159.92 --> 1160.98]  But no, real Vega.
[1161.08 --> 1162.82]  So our video's coming on that probably tomorrow.
[1163.24 --> 1163.42]  Okay.
[1163.42 --> 1163.74]  Okay.
[1163.80 --> 1164.60]  So what's the little end there?
[1164.62 --> 1167.74]  I feel like we're like going hard on AMD right now, but-
[1167.74 --> 1169.34]  Other than that, is there anything else?
[1169.72 --> 1174.24]  Every time we talk about any AMD news, like our viewers are just like, woo!
[1175.32 --> 1177.20]  I mean, it gives us a reason to be excited.
[1178.14 --> 1179.30]  It is actually an exciting time.
[1179.96 --> 1180.02]  It is.
[1180.02 --> 1181.50]  I feel like the last couple of years have been rough.
[1183.18 --> 1183.54]  Haven't they?
[1183.54 --> 1184.50]  It's been rough.
[1184.50 --> 1186.86]  It's about time for some good news, for some positivity.
[1187.10 --> 1187.24]  Right?
[1187.24 --> 1187.60]  2017.
[1187.84 --> 1189.20]  Like, have you played around with Kaby Lake?
[1189.60 --> 1189.80]  No.
[1189.80 --> 1190.60]  7,700K?
[1190.70 --> 1191.50]  Not even a little bit.
[1191.64 --> 1192.20]  Okay, don't bother.
[1192.46 --> 1192.94]  Okay, cool.
[1192.94 --> 1193.14]  Okay.
[1193.28 --> 1193.82]  I will not do that.
[1193.82 --> 1194.64]  Now we're on the same page.
[1194.74 --> 1194.92]  Perfect.
[1195.16 --> 1195.56]  Don't bother.
[1195.78 --> 1195.94]  Don't bother.
[1195.94 --> 1196.18]  Ryzen.
[1196.52 --> 1197.06]  Save your time.
[1197.18 --> 1198.88]  Unless, do you want to watch 4K Netflix?
[1199.44 --> 1200.08]  You know what?
[1201.00 --> 1201.50]  On your computer?
[1201.74 --> 1202.44]  No, I don't.
[1202.56 --> 1202.80]  Okay.
[1203.12 --> 1203.34]  No.
[1203.52 --> 1203.92]  Then, uh-
[1203.92 --> 1204.16]  Never.
[1204.26 --> 1204.90]  Never have I ever.
[1205.20 --> 1206.74]  Dude, I don't watch Netflix on my computer at all.
[1207.44 --> 1207.74]  Really?
[1207.94 --> 1210.94]  I like watch Netflix either on a tablet or just on my TV.
[1211.80 --> 1212.12]  Okay.
[1212.60 --> 1212.98]  Yeah.
[1212.98 --> 1214.28]  Yeah, I buy that.
[1214.58 --> 1215.68]  The built-in TV apps.
[1216.18 --> 1217.02]  They're not bad.
[1217.10 --> 1217.94]  They get a lot of attention.
[1218.08 --> 1221.68]  And Mike, the TV I use actually has 4K and HDR as well.
[1222.06 --> 1223.16]  So it's like, it's all built-in.
[1223.26 --> 1225.68]  Like, I usually don't like to use, like, the built-in TV apps.
[1225.78 --> 1225.86]  Right.
[1225.86 --> 1227.16]  But, like, it's all right there.
[1227.26 --> 1227.64]  Like, same thing.
[1227.68 --> 1229.80]  We've been watching, like, Grand Tour through Amazon.
[1230.26 --> 1231.90]  4K, HDR, touch nothing.
[1232.06 --> 1232.98]  It's actually, it's beautiful.
[1233.90 --> 1234.44]  Beautiful show.
[1234.54 --> 1234.60]  Yes.
[1234.84 --> 1235.02]  Yes.
[1235.58 --> 1235.74]  Yeah.
[1236.42 --> 1241.28]  Yours is the Samsung one that you did the sponsored gaming setup thing for, right?
[1241.30 --> 1241.32]  Yes.
[1241.32 --> 1242.04]  In...
[1242.04 --> 1245.32]  That's the same one that I got for World's Most Comfortable, is it?
[1245.32 --> 1246.40]  I believe so.
[1246.42 --> 1246.96]  I think so.
[1247.14 --> 1247.38]  Yeah.
[1247.54 --> 1247.82]  Okay.
[1247.94 --> 1248.04]  Yeah.
[1248.04 --> 1248.46]  It's a nice TV.
[1248.64 --> 1249.12]  It's a good TV.
[1250.20 --> 1251.70]  Now, of course...
[1251.70 --> 1252.08]  Of course.
[1252.18 --> 1254.78]  This year, the TV game is changing.
[1255.34 --> 1255.88]  Is it really?
[1255.96 --> 1257.10]  Is it actually changing?
[1257.56 --> 1258.00]  Just wait.
[1258.36 --> 1258.62]  Okay?
[1258.84 --> 1259.08]  Okay.
[1259.28 --> 1259.56]  Okay.
[1259.64 --> 1260.40]  I'll give you this.
[1260.46 --> 1260.78]  I'll give you this.
[1260.86 --> 1264.02]  Samsung is redefining the television category.
[1264.40 --> 1264.80]  Redefining?
[1264.92 --> 1265.42]  Tell me more.
[1265.52 --> 1266.20]  With QDot.
[1266.20 --> 1266.64]  QLED.
[1267.04 --> 1267.40]  Wait.
[1267.52 --> 1267.80]  QLED.
[1267.94 --> 1268.28]  QLED.
[1268.50 --> 1268.68]  Sorry.
[1268.98 --> 1269.22]  QLED.
[1269.22 --> 1269.66]  QLED?
[1269.84 --> 1270.08]  QLED.
[1270.08 --> 1271.20]  There's actually some dot in here, too.
[1271.32 --> 1273.70]  I screwed up and I called it QDot because it's Quantum Dot.
[1274.00 --> 1274.66]  Quantum Dot.
[1275.06 --> 1276.36]  Wait, but wasn't Quantum Dot already a thing?
[1276.46 --> 1276.68]  Yes.
[1276.84 --> 1278.66]  But now they're calling it QLED.
[1278.96 --> 1279.40]  QLED.
[1279.56 --> 1281.14]  So, I think the...
[1281.14 --> 1282.16]  The QLED is thing?
[1282.24 --> 1286.16]  I think the intent is to make it sound like OLED and look like OLED.
[1286.64 --> 1286.80]  Oh.
[1287.60 --> 1287.88]  Yes.
[1288.84 --> 1289.08]  Sure.
[1289.90 --> 1290.26]  Now...
[1290.26 --> 1292.98]  Speaking of OLED, just jumping in, did you see the Sony OLED?
[1293.56 --> 1293.94]  No.
[1294.52 --> 1296.24]  Sony now has three TVs.
[1296.36 --> 1300.62]  I don't know there's a specific brand name for them, but Sony now has three OLED TVs.
[1301.30 --> 1305.00]  And if you really find a picture of them, it's cool because it's essentially...
[1305.00 --> 1309.48]  It almost looks like an easel sort of thing where it sits down and it's kind of tilted back.
[1309.78 --> 1313.64]  So, from the front, you just see a super thin bezel and there's nothing below it.
[1314.02 --> 1316.70]  So, what they're doing is they're doing some interesting stuff with the actual speakers
[1316.70 --> 1319.02]  where it's actually resonating through the glass.
[1319.02 --> 1319.06]  Yes.
[1319.44 --> 1321.26]  I've heard of stuff like that before.
[1321.56 --> 1322.68]  And it's got a sub in the back.
[1322.76 --> 1323.64]  Yeah, you can see right there.
[1323.94 --> 1324.12]  Here.
[1324.36 --> 1326.02]  I'm going to try and screen share with them.
[1326.12 --> 1326.38]  Hopefully.
[1326.68 --> 1328.24]  Oh, I pressed a bad button.
[1330.22 --> 1330.62]  No, no.
[1330.64 --> 1331.16]  I think we're good.
[1331.30 --> 1331.74]  I think we're good.
[1331.76 --> 1332.58]  Are we still alive?
[1332.66 --> 1333.48]  Yeah, we're live.
[1333.56 --> 1334.44]  We are live.
[1334.54 --> 1336.00]  So, this is from theverge.com.
[1336.24 --> 1336.38]  Yeah.
[1336.44 --> 1337.58]  So, you can see it's...
[1337.58 --> 1339.52]  There's basically like almost no bezel, right?
[1339.96 --> 1340.28]  So...
[1340.28 --> 1340.88]  And there's nothing...
[1340.88 --> 1342.00]  There's no bezel on the bottom.
[1342.54 --> 1343.66]  And you can look at it from the side.
[1343.66 --> 1346.86]  So, basically, I don't know if you see any rear pictures, but it's sort of like got
[1346.86 --> 1349.20]  like a tilt in the back where there's a sub.
[1349.54 --> 1353.76]  But the idea is that not only is it thin, but there's some kind of speaker setup that's
[1353.76 --> 1354.78]  like actually uses the glass.
[1354.86 --> 1355.32]  There you go.
[1355.66 --> 1357.36]  But it uses the glass to actually resonate.
[1357.84 --> 1359.10]  So, I haven't actually heard it.
[1359.18 --> 1361.18]  They have the demos up, but obviously it's the show floor.
[1361.40 --> 1365.52]  But the Sony rep was talking about how it's sort of an interesting experience to have the
[1365.52 --> 1368.86]  sound come, not from like the bottom of the TV, but actually from the screen itself.
[1368.86 --> 1369.56]  Yeah, exactly.
[1369.78 --> 1370.48]  Just jumping in.
[1370.60 --> 1371.72]  But OLED is...
[1371.72 --> 1373.18]  The game is definitely kind of heating up there.
[1373.26 --> 1376.12]  So, I feel like Samsung absolutely has to be feeling the pressure.
[1376.34 --> 1377.92]  So, I did go to LG today.
[1378.20 --> 1378.38]  Yeah.
[1378.48 --> 1379.74]  And I saw the wallpaper TV.
[1380.00 --> 1380.94]  I haven't seen that yet.
[1381.08 --> 1381.30]  Okay.
[1381.52 --> 1382.26]  It mounts...
[1382.26 --> 1382.64]  Okay.
[1382.76 --> 1386.80]  So, all you need to know to know what's amazing, it mounts with magnets.
[1389.16 --> 1390.52]  It mounts to the wall with magnets.
[1391.42 --> 1391.78]  Okay.
[1391.80 --> 1392.46]  I need to see this.
[1392.64 --> 1394.56]  I just heard about this like an hour ago.
[1394.90 --> 1395.20]  Okay.
[1395.36 --> 1396.10]  So, it's really cool.
[1396.42 --> 1397.20]  It's like...
[1397.20 --> 1398.08]  So, it's fully rollable.
[1398.08 --> 1399.34]  Like you can like completely...
[1399.34 --> 1399.74]  No, no, no, no.
[1399.78 --> 1400.18]  No roll.
[1400.30 --> 1405.16]  But like they have one in the booth where they have like a robot arm that's like peeling
[1405.16 --> 1407.16]  it up a bit and then putting it back.
[1407.52 --> 1407.76]  Okay.
[1407.86 --> 1410.04]  So, you can see how thin it is and you can see how it's just like sticking.
[1410.36 --> 1410.58]  Right.
[1410.78 --> 1412.30]  It's crazy thin.
[1413.06 --> 1415.14]  And what LG is doing is...
[1415.14 --> 1415.64]  Okay.
[1415.78 --> 1420.02]  Do you know how I have my home computer set up with Corning optical...
[1420.02 --> 1420.28]  Oh, wait.
[1420.36 --> 1421.24]  You have it all in the closet.
[1421.44 --> 1421.78]  Yeah.
[1421.90 --> 1422.46]  Go in the closet.
[1422.56 --> 1422.64]  Okay.
[1423.26 --> 1425.02]  So, do you know...
[1425.02 --> 1425.24]  Okay.
[1425.24 --> 1426.32]  So, your Samsung TV.
[1426.50 --> 1426.64]  Yeah.
[1426.64 --> 1427.82]  You know how it has the One Connect.
[1428.08 --> 1428.68]  Yeah, absolutely.
[1428.76 --> 1432.96]  So, it has a single connector assuming you don't need to plug in hardline networking.
[1434.52 --> 1434.84]  Right?
[1435.42 --> 1436.06]  You don't use networking?
[1436.36 --> 1436.58]  Yeah.
[1438.20 --> 1438.52]  No.
[1438.74 --> 1439.96]  Wi-Fi is for chumps, yo.
[1440.08 --> 1444.02]  I mean, I literally have an on-hub router like six inches away from my TV which has one
[1444.02 --> 1444.96]  Ethernet out.
[1444.96 --> 1448.44]  I have a switch in the back of the TV but it's fine.
[1449.50 --> 1449.82]  Okay.
[1449.96 --> 1450.28]  I'm good.
[1450.38 --> 1450.64]  I'm fine.
[1450.78 --> 1451.28]  So, anyway.
[1451.52 --> 1455.62]  The One Connect is a single cable that goes to the TV and then the wire...
[1455.62 --> 1456.38]  The cord's not very long.
[1456.46 --> 1457.34]  I think it's only about four feet?
[1457.92 --> 1458.42]  Sure, yeah.
[1458.48 --> 1458.98]  Something like that.
[1458.98 --> 1459.08]  Sure.
[1459.08 --> 1459.20]  Yeah.
[1459.36 --> 1463.68]  So, the idea though is that that's where all your HDMI inputs go and then the One Connect
[1463.68 --> 1464.72]  is, I think.
[1464.84 --> 1466.30]  So, it's like clean wiring, right?
[1466.30 --> 1466.38]  Yeah.
[1466.92 --> 1469.56]  Anyway, LG is taking it one step further.
[1469.84 --> 1473.90]  So, they've got a short cable that runs to like a speaker bar that sits under it.
[1473.90 --> 1473.94]  Right.
[1473.94 --> 1474.08]  Right.
[1474.08 --> 1476.54]  That also acts as all the inputs and everything.
[1476.66 --> 1480.22]  Kind of like on their signature last year where it had like that speaker bar base.
[1480.26 --> 1480.78]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1480.86 --> 1481.54]  With all the inputs.
[1481.64 --> 1481.76]  Okay.
[1481.92 --> 1488.14]  So, this year they're using an optical cable that is pretty short to start but comes with
[1488.14 --> 1489.14]  a six foot extension.
[1489.66 --> 1489.94]  Okay.
[1489.94 --> 1497.02]  So, you can actually get like the input nonsense kind of like away from it if you're using your
[1497.02 --> 1500.98]  own home theater speaker setup and you would basically just have this wallpaper TV.
[1501.22 --> 1502.42]  How did the actual TV look?
[1503.16 --> 1503.66]  Really good.
[1504.08 --> 1504.38]  Okay.
[1504.78 --> 1507.00]  So, it's like even being as thin as it is.
[1507.20 --> 1509.70]  Like there was no like was it 1080, 4K?
[1510.08 --> 1510.60]  Oh, it was 4K.
[1510.86 --> 1511.22]  4K.
[1511.28 --> 1511.96]  And what size was it?
[1512.42 --> 1514.66]  It was, so they're doing 65 and 77.
[1515.14 --> 1515.48]  All right.
[1515.62 --> 1517.18]  So, about like the right size.
[1517.18 --> 1517.46]  Yeah, yeah.
[1517.64 --> 1520.12]  You get any bigger than that and it's like the thing's not transportable.
[1520.32 --> 1520.56]  Sure.
[1520.64 --> 1520.78]  Right?
[1520.84 --> 1521.74]  Like how are you going to get it home?
[1521.98 --> 1522.16]  Yeah.
[1523.62 --> 1524.46]  This sounds cool.
[1525.66 --> 1526.32]  Okay, interesting.
[1526.50 --> 1529.74]  So, is this still in the concept stage I'm guessing?
[1529.92 --> 1530.12]  No.
[1530.52 --> 1531.96]  No, this is going to be a real product like Q1.
[1531.96 --> 1532.34]  Oh, yeah.
[1532.46 --> 1533.30]  It's like Q1.
[1533.30 --> 1533.80]  Oh, yeah, it's coming.
[1534.08 --> 1534.28]  Yeah.
[1534.36 --> 1535.20]  Yo, okay.
[1535.20 --> 1536.16]  There's like lots of them here.
[1536.72 --> 1539.36]  So, there's a bit of a caveat though.
[1539.78 --> 1540.20]  It's OLED.
[1540.54 --> 1545.44]  It still doesn't achieve the thousand nit peak brightness that is considered acceptable
[1545.44 --> 1548.08]  for mastering HDR content in the first place.
[1548.08 --> 1551.86]  So, even though LG is supporting all four, I didn't even realize there were four.
[1552.16 --> 1554.48]  All four flavors of HDR.
[1554.64 --> 1555.64]  So, there's HDR10.
[1555.78 --> 1555.98]  Right.
[1556.12 --> 1556.84]  There's Dolby.
[1557.40 --> 1558.80]  There's Technicolor.
[1559.28 --> 1559.60]  Okay.
[1559.60 --> 1564.82]  And then there's, see, I actually might still have my notes open from the LG booth today.
[1565.22 --> 1565.42]  Yeah.
[1566.56 --> 1566.92]  Technic.
[1567.20 --> 1571.02]  Yeah, because I know that there's Main 10, which I feel like is probably becoming the
[1571.02 --> 1572.16]  most popular right now.
[1572.22 --> 1574.10]  But I think most, like the Xbox One.
[1574.44 --> 1576.42]  Actually, the Xbox One is Main 10, I think.
[1577.02 --> 1577.54]  Yeah, Main 10.
[1577.74 --> 1578.68]  I think that's the last one.
[1578.88 --> 1579.04]  Yeah.
[1579.04 --> 1581.36]  So, it supports all four.
[1581.48 --> 1585.00]  Although, one thing I do have, so it doesn't achieve that peak brightness that people are
[1585.00 --> 1585.52]  looking for.
[1585.70 --> 1585.86]  Okay.
[1585.90 --> 1588.80]  And then they also have a Quantum Dot competitor.
[1589.42 --> 1591.52]  And it took me, it was so funny.
[1592.04 --> 1593.62]  So, I'm like, what is this?
[1593.66 --> 1594.72]  The guy's like, Nano Dot.
[1595.18 --> 1596.64]  And I'm like, so what is it?
[1596.70 --> 1604.02]  He's like, it's nano particles that are made to optimally filter and enhance red and green.
[1604.40 --> 1605.22]  And I'm like, okay.
[1605.34 --> 1605.94]  Or red and blue.
[1606.08 --> 1606.68]  Whatever it is.
[1606.72 --> 1606.86]  Sure.
[1606.86 --> 1609.10]  I think it's red and green.
[1609.64 --> 1610.14]  Anyway, whatever.
[1610.28 --> 1611.68]  So, I'm like, okay, so it's Quantum Dot.
[1612.12 --> 1617.68]  And he's like, no, it's, they're one nanometer instead of like two to 12 nanometers of our
[1617.68 --> 1618.06]  competitors.
[1618.06 --> 1620.54]  It's like putting the filter closer to your eyes.
[1620.56 --> 1623.62]  And I'm like, okay, so like, how does it go in there?
[1623.70 --> 1624.62]  And he's like, it's on a film.
[1624.80 --> 1626.08]  And I'm like, okay, so it's Quantum Dot.
[1626.72 --> 1629.48]  And he's like, look, we're not supposed to say that.
[1629.64 --> 1631.62]  And I'm like, dude.
[1631.70 --> 1632.06]  What?
[1632.24 --> 1634.12]  I have like 18 minutes in your booth.
[1634.76 --> 1635.78]  Is it Quantum Dot?
[1635.78 --> 1637.06]  And he's like, yeah, it's Quantum Dot.
[1639.64 --> 1641.18]  But it's like really good Quantum Dot.
[1641.24 --> 1641.76]  I'm like, okay.
[1641.88 --> 1642.48]  Like, that's fine.
[1642.54 --> 1643.08]  I respect that.
[1643.12 --> 1643.84]  There's nothing wrong with that.
[1644.02 --> 1646.10]  But don't confuse me intentionally.
[1646.28 --> 1647.18]  Just tell me what it is.
[1647.26 --> 1651.20]  Because it's my job to DBS-ify this stuff.
[1651.32 --> 1651.38]  Right.
[1651.38 --> 1652.08]  Don't BS me.
[1652.24 --> 1655.32]  Go put that on your flyer at Future Shop or Best Buy.
[1655.32 --> 1656.46]  Oh, Future Shop doesn't exist anymore.
[1656.54 --> 1656.70]  Whatever.
[1657.22 --> 1657.70]  I'm Canadian.
[1657.96 --> 1658.88]  Circuit City, yo.
[1659.08 --> 1659.28]  Yeah.
[1659.72 --> 1660.62]  The source.
[1660.62 --> 1664.02]  So go put that on your flyer.
[1664.08 --> 1664.34]  Yeah, yeah.
[1664.34 --> 1664.80]  I don't care.
[1664.98 --> 1666.50]  My audience is too smart for that.
[1666.62 --> 1668.04]  They're going to kill me.
[1668.58 --> 1670.40]  And that's going to make me mad at you.
[1670.66 --> 1670.90]  Right.
[1670.98 --> 1672.82]  For you telling me the wrong thing to tell them.
[1673.18 --> 1674.16]  Don't do that to me.
[1674.48 --> 1674.78]  So anyway.
[1675.04 --> 1675.94]  So yeah, it's Quantum Dot.
[1675.98 --> 1676.54]  So Quantum Dot.
[1676.54 --> 1679.96]  So basically the biggest real downside there is just the brightness.
[1680.22 --> 1684.54]  But like, on a panel so thin, I feel like I would be willing to kind of give that up a little bit.
[1684.70 --> 1685.42]  And you know what?
[1685.50 --> 1693.12]  Quite frankly, there's only one piece of HDR content that isn't a tech demo that I've seen.
[1693.32 --> 1694.86]  Okay, I'll say movie, actually.
[1695.10 --> 1695.20]  Right.
[1695.20 --> 1697.46]  Because some of the stuff I was on-prem.
[1697.52 --> 1698.52]  Like an Ultra HD Blu-ray?
[1698.92 --> 1699.34]  Yeah.
[1699.54 --> 1700.22]  Life of Pi.
[1700.84 --> 1701.04]  Looks.
[1701.18 --> 1702.04]  Oh, yeah.
[1702.22 --> 1702.56]  Unreal.
[1702.90 --> 1703.08]  Yeah.
[1703.22 --> 1703.66]  In HDR.
[1704.02 --> 1704.14]  Yeah.
[1704.64 --> 1705.64]  Absolutely unreal.
[1705.64 --> 1711.66]  And with the signature, which is I think 600 nits peak brightness, I want to say.
[1711.68 --> 1712.10]  Was it really?
[1712.24 --> 1713.16]  Yeah, it wasn't that high.
[1713.38 --> 1713.58]  Okay.
[1713.58 --> 1717.80]  But because the blacks are so deep, and I'm usually watching in a fairly dim room, I didn't
[1717.80 --> 1719.92]  feel like it took away from the experience at all.
[1720.22 --> 1720.40]  Right.
[1720.46 --> 1723.22]  I didn't feel like the whites were not quite dazzling enough.
[1723.48 --> 1725.86]  Yeah, I mean, that feels like a really bright TV.
[1726.18 --> 1726.38]  I didn't know.
[1726.48 --> 1730.96]  So is 1,000 nits for all of the HDR standards, or is it different depending on the standard?
[1731.02 --> 1732.92]  Okay, so it's complicated because...
[1732.92 --> 1733.78]  Yeah, this whole thing is complicated.
[1733.78 --> 1735.16]  Yeah, OLED gets...
[1735.16 --> 1736.58]  So there's two different standards.
[1736.86 --> 1737.02]  Right.
[1737.12 --> 1738.98]  So OLED kind of gets one standard.
[1739.10 --> 1739.64]  Oh, I see what you mean.
[1739.66 --> 1740.62]  Because the blacks are deeper.
[1740.76 --> 1744.16]  Right, because it's not necessarily about the peak brightness as much as it is about
[1744.16 --> 1745.02]  the contrast, right?
[1745.06 --> 1745.62]  The range.
[1745.72 --> 1745.92]  Right.
[1746.06 --> 1746.32]  Right?
[1746.38 --> 1746.48]  Right.
[1747.02 --> 1750.90]  So it's different rules for LCDs that can't achieve pure black.
[1751.12 --> 1751.32]  Right.
[1751.78 --> 1754.84]  So they have to go crazy, crazy white to burn your retinas.
[1754.84 --> 1755.40]  That's right.
[1755.58 --> 1763.00]  So LGs are hitting like 1,500 nits peak brightness on the nano dot or whatever they're calling
[1763.00 --> 1763.12]  it.
[1763.12 --> 1763.36]  Wow.
[1763.56 --> 1764.16]  But then I think...
[1764.16 --> 1764.94]  That's a lot.
[1765.00 --> 1768.94]  I think Samsung's QLED is up near 2,000 or something like that?
[1768.94 --> 1769.58]  What's the point?
[1769.68 --> 1773.04]  Like, at that point, like, the TV, that's gotta be insanely bright.
[1773.28 --> 1777.16]  So the point is not that you would ever have the whole TV that bright.
[1777.42 --> 1777.58]  Right.
[1777.58 --> 1781.94]  In fact, one of the most annoying things about my OLED at home, because I use it, I have
[1781.94 --> 1782.86]  a computer hooked up to it.
[1782.96 --> 1783.10]  Right.
[1783.14 --> 1786.10]  If I open up File Explorer full screen, the whole thing goes down.
[1787.10 --> 1787.86]  Because between...
[1787.86 --> 1789.48]  Oh, we can't handle...
[1789.48 --> 1792.50]  Between power, like, power efficiency, like, regulations.
[1792.90 --> 1793.16]  Right.
[1793.46 --> 1795.06]  They can't actually draw that much power.
[1795.64 --> 1798.02]  To have every pixel 100% white.
[1798.12 --> 1798.92]  You know what this feels like?
[1799.18 --> 1801.94]  This feels like car manufacturers getting into, like, a horsepower war.
[1802.24 --> 1803.96]  It's like, well, our car's gonna do 200 miles an hour.
[1804.14 --> 1805.22]  Well, ours's gonna do 205.
[1805.28 --> 1807.18]  It's like, the speed limit is 65 miles an hour.
[1807.18 --> 1808.22]  I don't know what you guys are talking about.
[1808.32 --> 1809.24]  This feels exactly like that.
[1809.30 --> 1812.66]  And to actually punch through the nonsense and test it...
[1812.66 --> 1812.84]  Right.
[1813.28 --> 1819.00]  ...requires actually quite complex test patterns, because you have to have enough...
[1819.52 --> 1819.64]  Oh, I see.
[1819.64 --> 1820.74]  ...enough dark in the scene...
[1820.74 --> 1823.32]  To kind of trigger the algorithm and go, hey, look, I can actually crank the brightness.
[1823.36 --> 1823.68]  Right.
[1825.04 --> 1827.06]  Man, dude, this HDR stuff is goofy, right?
[1827.14 --> 1829.28]  Like, HDR content looks nice, don't get me wrong.
[1829.36 --> 1829.82]  Looks great.
[1829.92 --> 1834.52]  But, like, the standards, all the different styles, like, it's such a nightmare.
[1834.82 --> 1835.66]  It is a total nightmare.
[1835.66 --> 1836.82]  Like, why do we need four...
[1836.82 --> 1837.80]  Like, I didn't even realize there were four.
[1837.88 --> 1838.56]  I knew of three.
[1838.68 --> 1839.94]  It's a cluster, man.
[1840.30 --> 1841.24]  It's a total cluster.
[1841.54 --> 1841.68]  Yeah.
[1841.78 --> 1845.88]  And then on the content creation side of things, it gets more complicated.
[1846.10 --> 1848.16]  So this actually had nothing to do with the show this year.
[1848.32 --> 1848.44]  Yeah.
[1848.44 --> 1853.90]  But I had a great meeting with a guy from Portrait, which, formerly SpectraCal.
[1853.98 --> 1854.62]  Do you know SpectraCal?
[1854.72 --> 1855.02]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1855.14 --> 1855.40]  Okay.
[1855.56 --> 1856.78]  So they got acquired by Portrait.
[1857.10 --> 1858.72]  So now his email is him at Portrait.
[1859.08 --> 1859.94]  So I'm like, okay, hi.
[1860.52 --> 1861.94]  You're still you, but now you're...
[1861.94 --> 1862.80]  You still exist.
[1862.80 --> 1863.22]  Good job.
[1863.22 --> 1863.82]  Different you.
[1864.18 --> 1864.88]  Acquired you.
[1865.36 --> 1870.84]  So I had a meeting with him, and he goes, yeah, mastering HDR content is a total disaster.
[1871.30 --> 1872.54]  There's one display.
[1873.10 --> 1873.24]  Right.
[1873.24 --> 1876.96]  It's like a 30-something-inch display that everyone is using.
[1877.16 --> 1880.12]  I forget what the number was, because at that point it doesn't even really matter.
[1880.20 --> 1882.88]  It was like $30,000 or $50,000 or something like that.
[1882.88 --> 1882.94]  Yeah.
[1882.94 --> 1887.58]  There's one display, and there is...
[1887.58 --> 1889.74]  The support is kind of iffy.
[1890.50 --> 1892.88]  DaVinci Resolve apparently is kind of the go-to right now.
[1892.88 --> 1893.94]  I hear a lot about that with HDR.
[1894.10 --> 1894.20]  Yeah.
[1895.38 --> 1896.20]  And he goes...
[1896.20 --> 1898.08]  But there's like...
[1898.08 --> 1902.36]  So that's why only huge budget guys are able to master an HDR.
[1902.52 --> 1905.68]  If you're coloring on a $50,000 display, you probably have some resources behind you.
[1905.70 --> 1906.68]  You can use scopes.
[1907.06 --> 1907.24]  Right.
[1907.34 --> 1908.72]  And you can kind of get there.
[1909.06 --> 1909.24]  Right.
[1909.36 --> 1911.32]  But that's not the right way to do it.
[1911.32 --> 1915.82]  And if you want to grade for an aesthetic, you have to be able to look at it.
[1915.82 --> 1920.94]  And the thing is, so when you master an HDR, and I've looked into it a little bit, but
[1920.94 --> 1923.50]  I kind of get daunted by just how much there is.
[1923.60 --> 1923.74]  Yeah.
[1924.04 --> 1925.76]  So HDR is all 10-bit, right?
[1926.40 --> 1927.54]  That's my understanding.
[1927.60 --> 1930.30]  But 10-bit is not HDR, but HDR is always 10-bit.
[1930.74 --> 1930.86]  Right.
[1930.86 --> 1931.34]  Or can it be more?
[1931.52 --> 1931.78]  Yes.
[1932.72 --> 1933.08]  Okay.
[1933.50 --> 1934.96]  So at least 10-bit, right?
[1934.96 --> 1935.02]  Yes.
[1935.02 --> 1936.66]  Which is pretty much all web content.
[1936.78 --> 1937.84]  Like this, for example, is 8-bit.
[1938.10 --> 1938.24]  Yes.
[1938.24 --> 1940.18]  Like basically everything you watch right now is 8-bit.
[1940.18 --> 1940.24]  Yes.
[1940.24 --> 1941.78]  So YouTube does support.
[1941.96 --> 1942.54]  It does now.
[1942.66 --> 1943.10]  It does now.
[1943.38 --> 1946.96]  But it doesn't support 10-bit, it's HDR, which is all underneath it.
[1947.26 --> 1949.16]  But then there's also the color space is wider.
[1949.26 --> 1950.20]  Isn't it Rec. 2020?
[1950.54 --> 1950.98]  That's right.
[1951.52 --> 1953.08]  Which is like 30%.
[1953.08 --> 1953.46]  I don't know.
[1953.50 --> 1954.94]  It's a wider color gamut.
[1955.04 --> 1955.60]  Much wider.
[1955.80 --> 1955.94]  Yeah.
[1956.10 --> 1961.24]  And there's no display on Earth that can get anywhere near everything in Rec. 2020, which
[1961.24 --> 1961.72]  is fine.
[1961.80 --> 1961.96]  Right.
[1962.06 --> 1963.64]  Because there's a lot of room to grow in it.
[1963.64 --> 1972.98]  And then making matters even more complicated is that if you're working with a monitor,
[1973.44 --> 1976.98]  so let's say, so for example, LG is launching some HDR monitors.
[1977.48 --> 1977.58]  Okay.
[1977.58 --> 1979.88]  So the first thing I did, I was like, blah, blah, blah.
[1979.94 --> 1981.36]  Are these suitable for content creation?
[1981.86 --> 1983.14]  And they kind of go, no.
[1983.28 --> 1984.08]  We'll get back to you on that.
[1984.70 --> 1985.30]  Oh, okay.
[1985.42 --> 1985.62]  Okay.
[1985.62 --> 1986.18]  That's like a maybe.
[1986.28 --> 1986.94]  That's a strong maybe.
[1987.08 --> 1988.26]  No, I don't think it's strong.
[1988.26 --> 1990.26]  I think it's a weak sauce maybe.
[1991.68 --> 1996.12]  And so I went straight to my portrait guy and I'm like, hey, do you think we can create
[1996.12 --> 1996.62]  HDR on this?
[1996.66 --> 1997.78]  He kind of goes, yeah, it depends.
[1997.88 --> 1999.26]  Can it do a thousand nits peak brightness?
[1999.38 --> 2000.30]  He really wants that.
[2000.62 --> 2000.84]  Okay.
[2000.92 --> 2004.22]  And it depends on what kind of HDR it supports.
[2005.16 --> 2007.06]  Then it's dependent on the video card.
[2007.06 --> 2011.42]  So it was only this generation of Pascal video cards from NVIDIA where they finally
[2011.42 --> 2014.02]  allowed 10-bit output on the non-Quadros.
[2014.70 --> 2016.12]  Is that what it was?
[2016.12 --> 2021.72]  That's something that they've been holding back on Quadro for since, well, forever.
[2022.16 --> 2022.32]  Pretty much.
[2022.32 --> 2022.80]  Right, right.
[2022.86 --> 2024.90]  Because 10-bit has preceded HDR.
[2025.26 --> 2025.56]  That's right.
[2025.58 --> 2026.40]  10-bit has been around forever.
[2026.48 --> 2026.70]  Long time.
[2026.70 --> 2028.60]  In fact, 12-bit video has been around for.
[2028.70 --> 2028.94]  That's right.
[2029.20 --> 2029.32]  Yeah.
[2030.88 --> 2031.36]  Okay.
[2031.48 --> 2031.96]  So basically.
[2032.24 --> 2032.76]  Come on.
[2033.00 --> 2037.12]  Basically, this is like Blu-ray versus HD DVD except lame.
[2037.48 --> 2038.86]  And times a thousand.
[2039.22 --> 2039.50]  Yes.
[2039.72 --> 2041.20]  And yeah, pretty much.
[2041.64 --> 2043.36]  So anyway, there's a solution.
[2043.88 --> 2044.16]  Is there?
[2044.16 --> 2046.90]  There was, there's a Sony TV that's around five, six grand.
[2047.46 --> 2047.70]  Cheap.
[2047.70 --> 2048.78]  That's like a 65 inch.
[2048.92 --> 2049.14]  Okay.
[2049.30 --> 2056.88]  That has a mode specifically designed not for mastering HDR, but it's designed to behave
[2056.88 --> 2059.20]  like an HDR mastering display.
[2059.38 --> 2059.60]  Okay.
[2059.68 --> 2063.96]  So that the client can sit and look at the TV while the colorist is working on the 30,000,
[2064.10 --> 2065.72]  40, whatever, however many thousands of dollars.
[2066.14 --> 2066.38]  Okay.
[2066.38 --> 2069.26]  But what people have discovered is that it's actually very suitable.
[2069.78 --> 2070.26]  Oh, really?
[2070.34 --> 2071.24]  So you can use it for every year?
[2071.24 --> 2071.28]  Right.
[2071.48 --> 2074.58]  So we're thinking about, hey, maybe we should make a color station.
[2074.82 --> 2078.66]  Have you guys looked into actually, and we're probably going to get way in the weeds here
[2078.66 --> 2082.78]  for a second, but like what the actual workflow is to get HDR content onto YouTube?
[2083.24 --> 2084.02]  Is it just a simple?
[2084.42 --> 2084.66]  Okay.
[2084.78 --> 2085.44]  I haven't.
[2085.44 --> 2087.26]  Because I think you export in Premiere.
[2087.60 --> 2087.82]  Right.
[2088.10 --> 2090.48]  Then you plunk it into DaVinci Resolve.
[2090.48 --> 2091.28]  Oh, this is selling.
[2091.32 --> 2091.66]  Hold on.
[2091.72 --> 2092.02]  Hold on.
[2092.06 --> 2092.30]  Okay.
[2092.44 --> 2093.82]  And then it adds a bunch of metadata.
[2094.18 --> 2094.42]  Right.
[2094.78 --> 2095.86]  And then exports.
[2096.14 --> 2097.38]  And then you upload with the metadata.
[2097.56 --> 2098.78]  That's, I've never tried it.
[2098.84 --> 2102.92]  To be fair, I do know the new version of Final Cut does support Rec. 2020 straight out.
[2104.00 --> 2104.10]  So.
[2104.26 --> 2105.26]  So you can take Final Cut.
[2105.50 --> 2105.68]  Yeah.
[2105.74 --> 2106.60]  And you can put it up your butt.
[2106.60 --> 2112.92]  I could do that, or I can render my beautiful HDR video available now at youtube.com slash
[2112.92 --> 2113.46]  lionstechtips.
[2113.96 --> 2114.32]  Yeah.
[2114.46 --> 2116.22]  As if I would upload your videos.
[2116.34 --> 2118.24]  They're far too crispy for my channel, my friend.
[2118.58 --> 2123.24]  So assuming that you get the file out somehow, and even if it's a giant pain, you have to
[2123.24 --> 2124.28]  like run it through multiple things.
[2124.60 --> 2126.12]  Can you just upload it to YouTube?
[2126.30 --> 2129.74]  Because I know we were looking through, there are HDR videos that you can watch on YouTube
[2129.74 --> 2130.00]  now.
[2130.02 --> 2130.30]  That's right.
[2130.30 --> 2134.40]  But there's no clear way of knowing that you're watching HDR content unless you pull up like the
[2134.40 --> 2135.16]  stats for nerds.
[2135.16 --> 2139.42]  It's not just a little like HDR badge like 4K, which is like, is this even working?
[2139.68 --> 2139.76]  Yeah.
[2139.84 --> 2144.48]  And not only that, to make things even more complicated, say I get an HDR video to YouTube,
[2144.62 --> 2146.26]  YouTube compresses it and all that kind of stuff.
[2146.54 --> 2150.54]  It sends it out, how do you watch HDR YouTube unless you have maybe like a Chromecast Ultra?
[2150.88 --> 2153.06]  That's the only device I know that does HDR right now.
[2153.34 --> 2153.68]  Right.
[2154.10 --> 2156.74]  Because like, there are no computer monitors that you can watch it on.
[2156.98 --> 2157.90]  Not yet, but soon.
[2157.90 --> 2161.42]  There are no phones that are HDR compatible, maybe?
[2161.42 --> 2161.54]  Maybe?
[2162.10 --> 2165.34]  Oh, that's, I thought, isn't the iPhone 7?
[2166.10 --> 2167.52]  It's wide gamut.
[2167.54 --> 2168.12]  It's wide gamut.
[2168.14 --> 2169.64]  Wide gamut, but not HDR.
[2169.90 --> 2175.78]  Because I know that the iPhone and the iMac, they both have the same, it's not, it has a
[2175.78 --> 2176.72]  specific color space.
[2176.90 --> 2179.16]  It's not the same, but it's wider.
[2179.54 --> 2180.30]  I don't know if it's HDR.
[2180.30 --> 2186.70]  So it gets even more complicated there because I talked to Dell and they were saying that
[2186.70 --> 2191.78]  one of the issues in the industry is that there's lots of monitors out there that are
[2191.78 --> 2198.58]  going to do better than SDR, but are not up to the, like, the, the cinema industry HDR
[2198.58 --> 2198.94]  spec.
[2199.14 --> 2205.02]  And I think the industry has basically decided to just call them HDR with like HDR certified
[2205.02 --> 2207.10]  or some other moniker to come after that.
[2207.12 --> 2208.14]  Oh man, come on.
[2208.16 --> 2208.44]  Okay.
[2208.62 --> 2208.84]  Okay.
[2208.84 --> 2209.78]  This is actually gross.
[2209.92 --> 2210.88]  Let's give up on HDR.
[2211.42 --> 2213.36]  Have you seen the 8K display?
[2213.68 --> 2217.74]  No, I have not seen it, but it sounds crispy as they might say.
[2218.20 --> 2218.86]  Oh, kill me.
[2220.48 --> 2222.26]  Okay, yo, so did you actually see it again?
[2222.38 --> 2223.66]  I touched it today.
[2223.80 --> 2224.40]  You touched it.
[2224.48 --> 2224.66]  Okay.
[2224.80 --> 2225.42]  I touched it.
[2225.58 --> 2226.14]  Was it actually crazy?
[2226.14 --> 2233.88]  I touched it with my eyeball because that is how close I had to get to see a pixel.
[2233.98 --> 2234.96]  There's no way you can see pixels.
[2235.06 --> 2235.54]  There's no way.
[2235.54 --> 2237.20]  On 8K, how big is the display?
[2237.20 --> 2237.52]  Okay.
[2237.66 --> 2239.88]  It's 32 inches, I believe, from Dell.
[2240.24 --> 2240.56]  Okay.
[2240.56 --> 2240.68]  Goofy.
[2240.78 --> 2241.86]  It's unreal.
[2242.22 --> 2249.80]  So the thing had about 15, imagine this, okay, 1,500 clock faces on a 32 inch display.
[2249.96 --> 2250.22]  Okay.
[2250.22 --> 2254.00]  So it's like 60 by like 40 or something.
[2254.16 --> 2257.68]  I forget what it was, but I like did math in my head and it was probably wrong.
[2258.18 --> 2261.72]  So you've got like well over a thousand clock faces.
[2261.98 --> 2262.22]  Right.
[2262.22 --> 2264.04]  I could get right in on them.
[2264.38 --> 2264.56]  Okay.
[2264.60 --> 2266.52]  And there's like spacing around the clock faces.
[2266.76 --> 2269.86]  Like there's like a square and then there's like a circle inside and then there's like lines.
[2270.36 --> 2275.04]  And then I could see the minute lines on the clock faces.
[2276.18 --> 2276.58]  Okay.
[2277.14 --> 2277.54]  Okay.
[2278.12 --> 2278.56]  Okay.
[2278.56 --> 2281.06]  Can you just calm down for a second?
[2281.16 --> 2284.60]  Because I don't think I can handle the stress right now.
[2285.96 --> 2286.32]  Okay.
[2286.52 --> 2287.18]  So I'll just calm down.
[2287.30 --> 2288.26]  8K monitor.
[2288.82 --> 2289.90]  So let's come down to earth for a second.
[2290.14 --> 2290.30]  Yeah.
[2290.84 --> 2291.68]  Can I actually?
[2292.04 --> 2292.28]  No.
[2292.86 --> 2293.02]  Okay.
[2293.20 --> 2293.60]  Thanks.
[2294.06 --> 2294.22]  Sounds right.
[2294.42 --> 2295.06]  Go ahead.
[2295.16 --> 2296.46]  But whatever you're going to say, no.
[2297.16 --> 2300.80]  To connect it to anything, you need dual display port.
[2301.22 --> 2301.90]  No, no, no.
[2301.90 --> 2302.78]  Worse than that.
[2302.88 --> 2303.36]  Is it really?
[2304.40 --> 2304.76]  Okay.
[2305.46 --> 2306.02]  Here we go.
[2306.02 --> 2307.14]  So step number one.
[2307.24 --> 2307.84]  Step number one.
[2308.18 --> 2310.18]  It is 10 bit, which is cool.
[2310.36 --> 2310.64]  Great.
[2311.26 --> 2314.76]  It has great viewing angles, which is cool.
[2314.98 --> 2316.64]  I would expect for like a million dollar monitor.
[2316.68 --> 2318.76]  It has a programmable LUT.
[2319.84 --> 2320.48]  On a monitor?
[2320.48 --> 2325.38]  Which basically means that you can calibrate the monitor directly.
[2325.82 --> 2326.06]  Okay.
[2326.18 --> 2333.48]  And then plug it into anything and it will retain the color properties of the printer that you want it to look like.
[2333.82 --> 2334.00]  Right?
[2334.48 --> 2334.92]  Okay.
[2335.06 --> 2335.36]  Okay.
[2335.36 --> 2335.78]  Got it.
[2335.78 --> 2336.38]  Programmable LUT.
[2336.44 --> 2337.78]  Like if you plug in through the hub.
[2338.12 --> 2338.36]  Right.
[2338.40 --> 2339.48]  The USB hub on the monitor.
[2339.54 --> 2339.94]  Right, right, right.
[2340.00 --> 2343.66]  And there's a supported, it's the i1, it's the i1 Display Pro.
[2343.78 --> 2345.38]  It's like the standard one that everybody uses.
[2345.98 --> 2352.46]  And if you use that, it even like fills in all the metadata and crap in the calibration program that Dell co-created with XR.
[2352.50 --> 2352.78]  It's like.
[2353.22 --> 2354.22]  This is over the top.
[2354.28 --> 2354.56]  I love it.
[2354.62 --> 2354.74]  Go ahead.
[2354.74 --> 2354.86]  Okay.
[2355.00 --> 2355.80]  So very cool.
[2355.98 --> 2356.36]  Very cool.
[2358.54 --> 2360.62]  But how do I actually, I want to watch some PK videos.
[2360.64 --> 2361.36]  It is not HDR.
[2362.28 --> 2362.70]  That's fine.
[2362.84 --> 2363.36]  No HDR.
[2363.56 --> 2363.66]  Okay.
[2363.74 --> 2364.34]  I just want pixels.
[2364.34 --> 2364.92]  You're cool with that.
[2364.92 --> 2365.54]  You just want pixels.
[2365.70 --> 2369.00]  We just discovered that HDR is terrible and we'll be ready.
[2369.26 --> 2369.90]  I didn't say terrible.
[2370.02 --> 2370.44]  Well, okay.
[2370.50 --> 2371.02]  It's a disaster.
[2371.20 --> 2371.50]  It's a mess.
[2371.62 --> 2371.76]  Okay.
[2371.86 --> 2371.96]  Yeah.
[2372.16 --> 2372.38]  Okay.
[2372.52 --> 2372.74]  Okay.
[2372.80 --> 2375.46]  So now it is a tiled display.
[2375.96 --> 2376.16]  Okay.
[2376.16 --> 2377.72]  So you remember the early 4K displays.
[2377.78 --> 2379.90]  I still have one of those in my apartment.
[2380.10 --> 2380.26]  Right.
[2380.38 --> 2380.56]  Okay.
[2380.62 --> 2383.66]  So we were doing two DisplayPort 1.1s in.
[2383.88 --> 2384.06]  Yeah.
[2384.30 --> 2384.60]  Okay.
[2385.16 --> 2386.04]  So here's the problem.
[2387.32 --> 2388.64]  DisplayPort 1.2.
[2389.62 --> 2390.54]  How high does it go?
[2391.16 --> 2391.50]  You remember?
[2391.74 --> 2392.30]  1.2.
[2392.38 --> 2393.18]  That was 4K, right?
[2393.36 --> 2393.72]  4K.
[2393.78 --> 2394.20]  How many hertz?
[2395.30 --> 2395.54]  60.
[2395.98 --> 2396.30]  That's right.
[2396.50 --> 2396.76]  Okay.
[2397.14 --> 2398.46]  So here's a...
[2398.46 --> 2399.38]  I have a comment.
[2399.48 --> 2400.46]  Here's a small problem.
[2400.68 --> 2400.98]  Yeah.
[2401.04 --> 2401.68]  What can I do for you?
[2401.68 --> 2404.84]  They're working on getting it to work with just one cable, not two.
[2405.00 --> 2405.78]  Well, of course they are.
[2406.48 --> 2408.34]  Well, they said you'd be all thrilled.
[2409.28 --> 2409.96]  One cable?
[2410.18 --> 2411.06]  Wait, are you trying to say that...
[2411.06 --> 2412.82]  DisplayPort 1.4, I think.
[2412.98 --> 2413.22]  Yeah.
[2413.34 --> 2413.78]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2413.78 --> 2414.64]  We'll talk about that later.
[2414.64 --> 2415.04]  Okay.
[2415.24 --> 2415.52]  Okay.
[2415.52 --> 2415.82]  Sorry.
[2416.08 --> 2416.30]  Okay.
[2416.42 --> 2416.98]  Thank you, Taryn.
[2418.30 --> 2420.96]  I had to do a whole Mission Impossible creep over here.
[2421.12 --> 2421.32]  All right.
[2422.90 --> 2423.26]  Okay.
[2423.78 --> 2424.58]  So, right.
[2424.68 --> 2424.82]  Okay.
[2424.90 --> 2426.20]  So the math is pretty simple then, right?
[2427.06 --> 2428.26]  DisplayPort 1.2.
[2428.50 --> 2429.46]  4K 60 hertz.
[2429.46 --> 2429.82]  Right.
[2430.12 --> 2430.70]  So 8K...
[2430.70 --> 2432.12]  Like it's just a quarter of the way there.
[2432.34 --> 2433.82]  8K is...
[2433.82 --> 2434.40]  Quad that.
[2434.62 --> 2435.46]  Four times that.
[2435.52 --> 2435.68]  Right.
[2436.10 --> 2437.94]  So, but we're not plugging in four DisplayPorts.
[2438.02 --> 2438.36]  Of course not.
[2438.40 --> 2439.08]  That would be crazy.
[2439.30 --> 2441.06]  Nothing like that is going to be happening.
[2441.30 --> 2441.54]  So...
[2441.54 --> 2441.74]  Never.
[2441.84 --> 2443.52]  You need DisplayPort 1.3.
[2443.74 --> 2444.00]  Right.
[2444.10 --> 2445.44]  Which is not super common.
[2445.82 --> 2446.40]  Two of them.
[2447.26 --> 2447.56]  One point...
[2447.56 --> 2448.32]  What does 1.3 do?
[2448.52 --> 2449.64]  1.3...
[2449.64 --> 2450.92]  I don't remember...
[2450.92 --> 2451.04]  Yeah.
[2451.10 --> 2453.62]  1.3 does do 5K 60 hertz.
[2454.48 --> 2458.10]  So that's enough to drive the 33 million pixels.
[2458.32 --> 2458.86]  33 million.
[2458.86 --> 2460.86]  That's a 33 megapixel...
[2460.86 --> 2461.26]  That's right.
[2461.42 --> 2461.70]  Wow.
[2462.62 --> 2463.06]  Wow.
[2463.28 --> 2471.02]  So the only cards on the market are the latest generation Pascal based Quadros.
[2471.66 --> 2475.84]  The P3000, the P4000, and the P6000.
[2475.98 --> 2477.24]  So, you know what?
[2477.42 --> 2478.28]  Why don't we just for fun?
[2478.48 --> 2478.86]  You know what?
[2478.92 --> 2480.66]  Because this is the kind of thing that I do for fun.
[2480.66 --> 2482.94]  I go on Newegg.com, okay?
[2483.92 --> 2489.48]  And I get really, really mad about whatever is taking over my screen right now.
[2489.78 --> 2491.90]  And I go P3000 Quadro.
[2492.50 --> 2493.06]  Got it.
[2493.18 --> 2493.74]  Let's do it.
[2494.24 --> 2496.40]  And then I hate my life.
[2496.42 --> 2496.68]  Is it crying time?
[2496.94 --> 2498.24]  Because I can't even buy one.
[2499.22 --> 2499.74]  So there's that.
[2501.42 --> 2502.40]  They're on sale though, right?
[2502.48 --> 2503.28]  I thought so.
[2503.50 --> 2503.66]  I actually...
[2504.58 --> 2506.26]  I mean, they had a demo unit that...
[2506.26 --> 2506.40]  Okay.
[2506.86 --> 2507.04]  No, I'm pretty sure...
[2507.04 --> 2510.72]  I mean, clearly the computer that they had in the booth was running off of some...
[2510.72 --> 2511.90]  Yeah, it was running off of Quadro.
[2512.02 --> 2512.22]  Right.
[2512.44 --> 2513.32]  Okay, so hold on.
[2513.48 --> 2516.08]  Why is my computer being a butthead?
[2516.56 --> 2517.78]  Now's not the time, butthead.
[2517.88 --> 2518.00]  Okay.
[2518.48 --> 2520.42]  Quadro P6000?
[2521.70 --> 2522.50]  Can I buy one of those?
[2522.50 --> 2524.00]  The Quadro stuff, like I'm...
[2527.76 --> 2528.50]  Oh, wow.
[2528.54 --> 2529.48]  You're killing the stream right now, man.
[2529.48 --> 2530.70]  I'm probably killing the stream.
[2530.72 --> 2531.30]  You just used all the internet.
[2531.46 --> 2532.20]  There's no internet left.
[2532.66 --> 2532.92]  Okay.
[2533.26 --> 2535.46]  Quadro P3000 price.
[2535.46 --> 2536.88]  Let's just try good old Google.
[2537.02 --> 2538.94]  And I spelled it wrong, but Google will fix that for me.
[2539.00 --> 2541.54]  Thank you, Google overlords.
[2542.30 --> 2543.98]  So no one's even talking about it.
[2544.04 --> 2545.08]  Where do I get one?
[2545.62 --> 2545.88]  Okay.
[2545.92 --> 2546.92]  Wait, are they on sale yet though?
[2547.16 --> 2548.28]  I don't even see anything.
[2548.44 --> 2548.56]  No.
[2548.58 --> 2549.38]  Wait, go up, go up.
[2549.42 --> 2550.22]  Yeah, I got nothing.
[2550.86 --> 2551.14]  Quiet.
[2551.14 --> 2551.50]  In July?
[2551.84 --> 2551.98]  Announces.
[2552.14 --> 2554.00]  Yeah, announces in July, but like I don't see them.
[2555.02 --> 2558.04]  I mean, I'm guessing these things are not flying off the shelves right now, but...
[2558.04 --> 2558.26]  Yeah.
[2558.76 --> 2559.38]  So, okay.
[2559.60 --> 2560.52]  So there you go.
[2560.90 --> 2562.00]  Two DisplayPort 1.3s.
[2562.02 --> 2562.98]  So give up and go home.
[2562.98 --> 2565.92]  Oh, and did I mention that the monitor costs five grand?
[2568.24 --> 2569.04]  Which actually...
[2569.04 --> 2569.92]  That's actually not crazy.
[2569.92 --> 2570.40]  Not that unreasonable.
[2570.40 --> 2571.86]  Yeah, that's not totally insane.
[2571.88 --> 2573.64]  That's not that far out there compared to like...
[2573.64 --> 2576.16]  I don't know if you guys remember like the old Apple 30 inch.
[2576.74 --> 2577.66]  Oh man, dude.
[2577.86 --> 2578.96]  That was like...
[2578.96 --> 2581.68]  That was like 12 years ago, 13 years ago.
[2581.88 --> 2582.02]  Yeah.
[2582.08 --> 2583.90]  Back when the 30 inch monitors first hit the scene.
[2583.90 --> 2584.84]  That was 1440p, right?
[2584.84 --> 2586.00]  No, that was...
[2586.00 --> 2588.62]  Well, that was the predecessor to 1440p.
[2588.68 --> 2589.98]  2560 by 1600.
[2590.16 --> 2592.28]  Back when we had 16 by 10 aspect ratio.
[2592.40 --> 2592.98]  Fine, fine.
[2593.30 --> 2595.44]  I loved 16 by 10 aspect ratio.
[2596.42 --> 2597.22]  Now I'm...
[2597.22 --> 2599.62]  Why are you all about making me sad on the show today?
[2600.62 --> 2600.94]  I don't know.
[2600.96 --> 2601.32]  I just...
[2601.32 --> 2602.42]  I have this effect on people.
[2602.62 --> 2604.10]  Speaking of sadness...
[2604.10 --> 2604.62]  Sadness.

[2646.48 --> 2648.04]  Just Google AMD New Horizon.
[2648.56 --> 2650.30]  They have a URL but it's really long and dumb.
[2650.66 --> 2651.64]  And also Synergy!
[2652.04 --> 2653.30]  Synergy is a sponsor for CS?
[2653.36 --> 2653.74]  That's awesome.
[2653.80 --> 2654.68]  Have you used Synergy before?
[2654.70 --> 2655.50]  I've not.
[2655.58 --> 2657.06]  Okay, the company is Seamless.
[2657.72 --> 2661.66]  And Synergy is an application that you can run on any platform.
[2661.84 --> 2664.50]  Windows, Mac, Linux.
[2664.50 --> 2670.42]  And what it does is it allows over the network your keyboard and mouse to work across all of them.
[2670.54 --> 2671.48]  Oh, yo, that's cool.
[2671.68 --> 2671.86]  Yeah.
[2672.02 --> 2672.44]  That's cool.
[2672.54 --> 2675.46]  So Luke did a demo with it where he had six computers lined up.
[2675.86 --> 2678.56]  And just like we moved the mouse across them all.
[2679.20 --> 2679.70]  Wait, sorry.
[2679.80 --> 2683.70]  So as if like they were all like one computer and like a bunch of displays side by side?
[2683.82 --> 2684.22]  That's right.
[2685.22 --> 2685.76]  How does that work?
[2685.84 --> 2687.02]  The latency is really low.
[2687.68 --> 2688.68]  Not like gaming.
[2689.32 --> 2689.74]  Right, right, right.
[2689.74 --> 2691.90]  For desktop use, it's like...
[2691.90 --> 2699.60]  That could be like an ultimate way of getting like a giant cheap setup if you don't want to get like some Quadro crazy card to like have like a million displays or something.
[2699.78 --> 2700.06]  Yeah, potentially.
[2700.20 --> 2704.18]  I think more people are using it for like this is my like render machine.
[2704.52 --> 2705.66]  Oh, I see, I see.
[2705.66 --> 2709.50]  And they just go bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop, bloop over here as if it's a separate display but it's a completely different computer.
[2710.58 --> 2711.10]  That is...
[2711.10 --> 2711.54]  That's cool.
[2711.82 --> 2712.14]  That's cool.
[2712.46 --> 2717.98]  So those guys are over at Seamless.com slash Synergy slash Linus-Tech-Tips.
[2717.98 --> 2721.12]  And you can save 25% on Synergy if you guys go check that out.
[2721.18 --> 2721.74]  I'm actually...
[2721.74 --> 2722.84]  I actually want to go check that out.
[2722.84 --> 2725.84]  Those guys are going to get a link in the chat.
[2725.96 --> 2726.44]  Let's get that.
[2726.54 --> 2726.82]  Whoa.
[2726.94 --> 2727.88]  A link in the chat?
[2727.96 --> 2729.32]  Let's get that link going on over there.
[2729.40 --> 2729.90]  Yeah, that's right.
[2730.04 --> 2730.48]  That's right.
[2730.56 --> 2731.30]  That's impressive right there.
[2731.42 --> 2731.82]  All right.
[2732.46 --> 2733.38]  Let's go ahead.
[2733.98 --> 2734.62]  Go right there.
[2735.04 --> 2735.40]  Okay.
[2736.04 --> 2737.98]  So let's talk about...
[2738.98 --> 2740.18]  Do you want me to come up with a topic?
[2740.24 --> 2741.06]  Because I got a pretty good one.
[2741.18 --> 2743.20]  I have absolutely no planning whatsoever.
[2743.30 --> 2744.30]  I just showed up.
[2744.60 --> 2745.30]  Which was nice of you.
[2745.30 --> 2745.58]  Okay.
[2745.58 --> 2750.74]  Have you seen Razer's concept triple display notebook?
[2750.80 --> 2752.06]  I saw everyone talking about it.
[2752.10 --> 2753.76]  I actually haven't seen it in person.
[2753.84 --> 2754.98]  I haven't seen anything cool to see yet.
[2755.28 --> 2755.94]  Actually, I have.
[2756.00 --> 2756.78]  But I'll save that for later.
[2756.92 --> 2757.10]  Me?
[2758.90 --> 2759.60]  Is this hug time?
[2760.32 --> 2761.32]  What are you doing on camera right now?
[2762.28 --> 2762.64]  Okay.
[2762.78 --> 2762.98]  Okay.
[2763.98 --> 2764.34]  Okay.
[2764.84 --> 2765.88]  I feel better now.
[2766.00 --> 2766.36]  Thank you.
[2766.80 --> 2767.16]  Okay.
[2767.20 --> 2768.26]  This is getting a little close.
[2768.56 --> 2769.44]  It's not weird enough yet.
[2769.56 --> 2769.76]  Okay.
[2769.82 --> 2770.02]  Sorry.
[2770.08 --> 2770.22]  Go ahead.
[2770.90 --> 2771.76]  They're very strong.
[2771.76 --> 2775.38]  All right.
[2775.44 --> 2775.64]  Sorry.
[2776.08 --> 2776.48]  Words.
[2776.98 --> 2777.34]  Technology.
[2777.48 --> 2777.74]  Okay.
[2777.90 --> 2778.22]  Razer.
[2778.28 --> 2778.52]  Let's do it.
[2778.56 --> 2778.62]  Let's do it.
[2778.62 --> 2780.66]  So you did a video on the triple screen.
[2781.38 --> 2782.22]  It's project what?
[2782.90 --> 2783.84]  Project Valerie.
[2784.26 --> 2784.62]  Valerie.
[2784.86 --> 2785.14]  Valerie.
[2785.14 --> 2785.46]  I love...
[2785.46 --> 2788.04]  Yo, can we give a shout out to Razer and their amazing project names?
[2788.14 --> 2789.50]  I feel like every CES...
[2789.50 --> 2789.96]  Fiona.
[2790.34 --> 2790.72]  Yeah.
[2791.12 --> 2791.48]  Christine.
[2791.80 --> 2792.08]  Dude.
[2792.52 --> 2792.72]  Okay.
[2792.88 --> 2794.58]  So it's essentially...
[2794.58 --> 2798.36]  Is it similar to like a Blade just with like the screen or like is it a fully custom
[2798.36 --> 2798.92]  like laptop?
[2799.08 --> 2800.90]  It is similar to a Blade Pro.
[2801.16 --> 2801.46]  Okay.
[2801.56 --> 2802.32]  So that's the 17.
[2802.42 --> 2804.38]  So the 17 inch Blade with the terrible keyboard.
[2805.14 --> 2805.72]  Is it that bad?
[2806.36 --> 2806.86]  It's awful.
[2807.16 --> 2808.26]  It's the mechanical one, right?
[2808.28 --> 2808.40]  Yeah.
[2808.94 --> 2810.26]  I feel like I tried it and it wasn't that bad.
[2810.30 --> 2811.48]  But I didn't actually like properly use it.
[2811.48 --> 2813.06]  I just like typed for like five seconds.
[2813.16 --> 2813.34]  Yeah.
[2813.50 --> 2814.08]  Not long enough.
[2814.28 --> 2814.50]  Okay.
[2814.50 --> 2817.66]  I tried to write my review of the Blade Pro on the Blade Pro.
[2817.92 --> 2818.34]  And you couldn't?
[2818.44 --> 2819.48]  And I switched back to my Blade.
[2819.64 --> 2820.12]  I was done.
[2820.12 --> 2820.52]  Okay.
[2820.82 --> 2824.60]  That's a resounding recommendation from Mr. Linus Sebastian.
[2824.64 --> 2825.96]  I was entirely done, my friend.
[2826.72 --> 2827.14]  All right.
[2828.08 --> 2831.32]  So basically the console...
[2831.32 --> 2831.60]  Thanks.
[2831.60 --> 2837.46]  You know how any modern notebook these days has like a pretty thin screen like display
[2837.46 --> 2838.12]  stack, right?
[2838.32 --> 2841.78]  They've got like a nice aluminum or like carbon fiber, some kind of cool material.
[2841.78 --> 2843.06]  They've got like a really thin thing.
[2843.14 --> 2845.24]  Then they've got like a really slick display stack.
[2845.34 --> 2845.42]  Right.
[2845.44 --> 2847.38]  I saw Dell's XPS 13 2-in-1.
[2847.98 --> 2848.56]  Super thin.
[2848.74 --> 2849.04]  Beautiful.
[2849.24 --> 2849.62]  Super thin.
[2850.12 --> 2855.68]  So anyway, the Blade Pro, not a Blade Pro because it's just, it's about the concept.
[2855.94 --> 2857.64]  It's not about the machine it's attached to.
[2857.84 --> 2861.60]  That was just a convenient reason that they didn't have to create something custom to show
[2861.60 --> 2862.08]  their concept.
[2862.42 --> 2862.58]  Right.
[2862.94 --> 2867.74]  But instead of having a thin display, it had like a display like this.
[2867.88 --> 2868.74]  Like an old school laptop.
[2868.88 --> 2869.04]  Yeah.
[2869.14 --> 2870.56]  And then the laptop is like this thick.
[2871.02 --> 2871.28]  Okay.
[2871.68 --> 2872.48]  I mean, that's not crazy.
[2872.48 --> 2873.86]  It's 17 inches.
[2874.36 --> 2875.40]  And it's like this thick.
[2875.60 --> 2875.84]  All right.
[2875.88 --> 2876.52]  But I mean, okay.
[2876.66 --> 2877.28]  For real though.
[2877.36 --> 2878.68]  Like, so is this your daily?
[2878.88 --> 2879.04]  Yeah.
[2879.04 --> 2879.40]  This is my daily.
[2879.44 --> 2880.28]  It's a 14, right?
[2880.38 --> 2880.54]  Yeah.
[2880.54 --> 2886.20]  So if you're carrying around a 17 inch laptop, portability is probably not your biggest concern.
[2886.66 --> 2886.98]  Okay.
[2887.34 --> 2888.00]  That's fair.
[2888.34 --> 2892.20]  I mean, for me, like if I'm carrying around a laptop that's that big, being a little bit
[2892.20 --> 2893.50]  thicker is not going to break it.
[2893.60 --> 2893.86]  Okay.
[2893.92 --> 2894.88]  Let me hit you with this then.
[2894.94 --> 2897.72]  If portability is not your biggest concern, why don't you just carry around a monitor?
[2897.72 --> 2901.88]  I mean, I don't carry around a 17 or a monitor.
[2902.40 --> 2907.24]  But in theory, if I was a person who was interested in a 17 inch laptop, it's going to be big.
[2907.34 --> 2912.28]  So being a little bit bigger and having two extra monitors, that's kind of compelling.
[2912.92 --> 2916.24]  I don't know how useful that's going to be, but that's a cool idea.
[2916.36 --> 2924.68]  Because I feel like wasn't there another, some dual screen laptop that was like this a few years ago where you would open it up and it wasn't three screens,
[2924.76 --> 2926.46]  but it was two screens that would like kind of like pop out.
[2926.46 --> 2928.78]  I don't remember the name of it, but do you know what I'm talking about?
[2928.84 --> 2930.12]  I don't remember that.
[2930.84 --> 2932.80]  I'm going to Google like dual screen laptop or something.
[2932.98 --> 2934.74]  But I'm going to make a separate argument anyway.
[2934.82 --> 2935.08]  Go for it.
[2935.10 --> 2941.88]  So what I think is that you're better off creating an attachment that runs off like Thunderbolt 3.
[2942.62 --> 2944.00]  And you would like kind of snap on or something?
[2944.00 --> 2945.70]  Like a clip on that folds up or something.
[2946.08 --> 2946.22]  Right.
[2946.22 --> 2948.12]  Because that way I don't have to carry it all the time.
[2949.62 --> 2954.30]  Or by the time displays get thin enough for that notebook to make any sense,
[2954.30 --> 2959.28]  I think we're going to have lighter, much higher resolution HMDs.
[2959.32 --> 2959.60]  Absolutely.
[2959.76 --> 2965.02]  And I'm going to sit and look at – if I need a workspace this big, I'm going to sit and look at it in my HMD.
[2965.02 --> 2966.00]  This is what I'm talking about right here.
[2966.18 --> 2966.96]  Oh, what is that?
[2967.32 --> 2968.12]  The Kogenesha?
[2968.12 --> 2970.18]  This is two 10-inch.
[2970.26 --> 2970.44]  Yeah.
[2972.08 --> 2973.12]  Kogenesha DC.
[2974.26 --> 2974.90]  The DZ.
[2975.16 --> 2975.36]  Yeah.
[2975.36 --> 2977.76]  So basically it's like two 10-inch displays.
[2978.02 --> 2979.24]  I don't know what the mechanism is.
[2979.30 --> 2981.16]  I think it was a thing where it kind of like pops out.
[2981.54 --> 2983.28]  But I've seen this kind of thing before.
[2983.38 --> 2984.60]  I've never seen three displays.
[2985.06 --> 2987.92]  And everything that I have seen was kind of basic.
[2988.28 --> 2990.02]  Like it was kind of – it was obviously super thick.
[2990.22 --> 2993.26]  This seems to be actually – even though it's obviously thicker than a traditional screen,
[2993.54 --> 2996.30]  it seems like it's like a properly designed thing that's actually kind of cool.
[2996.48 --> 2996.92]  Yeah, there you go.
[2996.94 --> 2997.12]  That's it.
[2997.12 --> 2997.22]  Okay.
[2997.32 --> 3000.68]  So here, let me just get that on the stream for you guys.
[3000.86 --> 3004.48]  So this is the one that Austin was talking about.
[3005.16 --> 3006.34]  It's obviously really clunky.
[3006.46 --> 3008.12]  And this is a little bit of an older design, too.
[3008.12 --> 3010.94]  I don't know when it's from, but it's like – it's definitely a few years old.
[3011.54 --> 3011.90]  Okay.
[3012.00 --> 3013.32]  So here's Project Valerie.
[3013.60 --> 3014.42]  Have you at least seen it?
[3014.84 --> 3016.22]  I've seen like pictures on Twitter.
[3016.48 --> 3018.20]  I haven't watched any videos at all since I've been here.
[3018.32 --> 3018.58]  Okay.
[3018.74 --> 3020.42]  So here, let's – let's –
[3020.42 --> 3020.94]  Oh, so wait.
[3021.04 --> 3024.18]  So do the screens actually kind of tilt out towards you or are they all flat?
[3024.28 --> 3026.30]  So that depends on which one you're using.
[3026.38 --> 3028.26]  They actually had two in the suite.
[3028.26 --> 3028.38]  Oh, okay.
[3028.64 --> 3028.84]  Okay.
[3029.32 --> 3030.94]  So here we go.
[3030.98 --> 3034.20]  So here's the – here's the one that – oh, really?
[3034.46 --> 3034.86]  Okay, whatever.
[3035.10 --> 3035.48]  Good enough.
[3035.48 --> 3037.80]  I mean Twitch compression is going to look like balls anyway.
[3038.12 --> 3043.42]  So this is the one that had like FACO – let me just make sure I'm actually showing this to people.
[3043.58 --> 3044.04]  Yeah, I am.
[3044.62 --> 3045.58]  Oh, what did I just do?
[3045.60 --> 3046.18]  You actually zoomed in.
[3046.24 --> 3046.60]  What did I do?
[3046.60 --> 3047.88]  Oh, you opened the actual image.
[3048.30 --> 3048.50]  Okay.
[3049.28 --> 3049.56]  Okay.
[3049.56 --> 3059.42]  So this is the one that had like FACO hinges that are like the concept for how it would kind of like straighten out and then like fold in.
[3059.88 --> 3060.10]  Okay.
[3060.10 --> 3060.78]  And slide in.
[3061.04 --> 3065.24]  So this is the one that actually gives you a little bit of surround where there's like – it's not just a fully flat setup.
[3065.36 --> 3065.52]  Okay.
[3065.52 --> 3076.20]  So then they also had another one in the suite that had the two outside displays in front of the back one and you just kind of slid them out and they were all kind of in a straight line.
[3077.18 --> 3077.40]  Okay.
[3077.56 --> 3079.40]  So that's what they – that's what's working now.
[3079.48 --> 3080.54]  No, no, they're both equally thick.
[3080.66 --> 3080.80]  Okay.
[3080.86 --> 3081.92]  That one's working now.
[3081.98 --> 3082.32]  Right.
[3082.32 --> 3085.00]  And the other one just had like concept hinges done up.
[3085.04 --> 3085.82]  They were like, don't pick it up.
[3085.86 --> 3086.38]  Don't pick it up.
[3086.42 --> 3086.82]  Don't touch it.
[3086.98 --> 3087.32]  Don't drop it.
[3087.32 --> 3088.00]  Drop it.
[3088.44 --> 3090.32]  Have you dropped anything at CES besides Ryzen?
[3090.74 --> 3091.30]  I'm sorry.
[3091.58 --> 3091.76]  Vega.
[3091.94 --> 3094.26]  I've dropped a few things but I haven't broken anything yet.
[3094.72 --> 3095.46]  Oh, good job.
[3095.54 --> 3096.32]  I'm actually doing –
[3096.32 --> 3098.56]  Dude, we're like halfway through CES right now and you haven't broken anything.
[3098.66 --> 3099.16]  That's really impressive.
[3099.28 --> 3100.14]  I'm doing really well this year.
[3100.24 --> 3100.68]  Good job, man.
[3100.74 --> 3101.22]  Good job.
[3101.52 --> 3102.40]  You're pulling your life together.
[3102.52 --> 3103.38]  I'm feeling good about that.
[3103.56 --> 3108.14]  I wouldn't say I'm pulling my life together but I'm definitely pulling my not dropping things properly together.
[3108.14 --> 3109.16]  I mean, yeah.
[3109.40 --> 3110.68]  Reddit's going to be unhappy but whatever.
[3110.68 --> 3110.98]  Okay.
[3112.04 --> 3113.28]  Predator 21X.
[3113.40 --> 3114.16]  Yo, dude.
[3114.24 --> 3115.18]  I haven't seen it yet.
[3115.46 --> 3116.34]  It looks so great.
[3116.34 --> 3117.90]  It looks like the coolest thing ever.
[3117.98 --> 3119.98]  Well, not really but it's so ridiculous.
[3120.06 --> 3120.48]  I love it.
[3120.64 --> 3122.14]  It's 18 pounds.
[3124.02 --> 3125.34]  I mean –
[3125.34 --> 3127.10]  It's got dual 1080s, right?
[3127.66 --> 3128.82]  Dual 1080s.
[3128.96 --> 3130.34]  Totally unfettered.
[3131.00 --> 3132.14]  Dual 1080s.
[3132.38 --> 3133.68]  No TDP restrictions.
[3133.94 --> 3134.58]  None of that BS.
[3134.62 --> 3135.60]  Does this thing actually have a battery?
[3136.32 --> 3137.70]  Yeah, it's not very big.
[3137.84 --> 3140.16]  Can you like run this thing for like 15 minutes on the battery?
[3140.54 --> 3141.70]  I didn't even ask.
[3142.52 --> 3145.98]  It's like asking about the fuel economy of a Lamborghini.
[3145.98 --> 3149.34]  Yeah, it's like – so this thing gets a good highway fuel mileage, right?
[3149.36 --> 3155.02]  When I go on a road trip to Castlegar, British Columbia, how many times will I have to fill
[3155.02 --> 3156.98]  my tank with super, super premium?
[3157.84 --> 3158.24]  No.
[3158.24 --> 3159.20]  Okay, okay.
[3159.38 --> 3162.70]  So we've got a 21-inch curved display?
[3163.30 --> 3164.72]  21-inch curved display.
[3165.24 --> 3167.00]  So wait, how is the curved display?
[3167.06 --> 3169.30]  Because I don't think I've ever seen a laptop with a curved display.
[3169.48 --> 3172.10]  Nobody's ever seen a laptop with a curved display because it's bananas.
[3172.92 --> 3176.92]  Because it's completely – I mean, the clamshell, like –
[3176.92 --> 3179.10]  Is it kind of like the Surface Book?
[3179.64 --> 3179.96]  Yeah.
[3180.20 --> 3182.22]  But kind of like in reverse where it's like on the front and still on the side?
[3182.22 --> 3185.56]  But it's like it's a big – you know, flip it upside down, you've got a big smiley
[3185.56 --> 3185.82]  face.
[3186.08 --> 3187.48]  Like it doesn't –
[3187.48 --> 3189.02]  Or a banana shape, you might say.
[3189.14 --> 3189.36]  Yeah.
[3189.92 --> 3191.98]  And we should have put a banana next to it for scale.
[3192.48 --> 3192.70]  Yeah.
[3192.74 --> 3193.96]  Which would have been the optimal way to show up a laptop.
[3193.96 --> 3196.44]  Did you see the picture of someone put a 12-inch MacBook on top of it?
[3196.58 --> 3197.96]  It was the most hilarious thing ever.
[3198.26 --> 3198.88]  Oh, man.
[3198.88 --> 3199.46]  No, I didn't.
[3199.46 --> 3200.56]  It was like –
[3200.56 --> 3200.72]  Yeah.
[3200.82 --> 3202.16]  I mean, you can imagine what that would look like.
[3203.00 --> 3204.14]  It was like –
[3204.14 --> 3204.68]  I don't know.
[3205.60 --> 3205.96]  Terrible.
[3206.14 --> 3206.40]  Yeah.
[3206.98 --> 3207.34]  Terrible.
[3207.58 --> 3208.04]  So, okay.
[3208.22 --> 3210.30]  So, this thing is custom order though, right?
[3210.34 --> 3212.46]  Like this is not like a thing I'm just going to walk into –
[3212.46 --> 3212.72]  No.
[3213.04 --> 3213.34]  No.
[3213.78 --> 3215.06]  I talked to them about that.
[3215.20 --> 3215.44]  Okay.
[3215.54 --> 3216.54]  That was the plan.
[3216.86 --> 3217.10]  Right.
[3217.30 --> 3219.94]  But they've actually since reversed that decision.
[3220.24 --> 3220.62]  Really?
[3220.82 --> 3221.06]  Yes.
[3221.16 --> 3223.12]  There was that much excitement and that much hype about it?
[3223.12 --> 3223.80]  It is a –
[3223.80 --> 3224.06]  Okay.
[3224.24 --> 3229.26]  So, I had a contact of mine who you also know, but I'm not going to name
[3229.26 --> 3229.84]  this person.
[3229.94 --> 3230.08]  Yeah.
[3230.46 --> 3236.60]  Reach out to me and tell me that if I could steal it from Acer, this contact of mine would
[3236.60 --> 3239.36]  pay double the sticker price to have it today.
[3240.22 --> 3240.66]  Wow.
[3241.04 --> 3245.58]  I believe, and apparently Acer also believes, that there is a market out there.
[3245.98 --> 3248.46]  I don't know what retailer is going to carry this thing.
[3248.52 --> 3252.30]  I mean, can you imagine accepting a return on a $9,000 laptop?
[3254.04 --> 3258.06]  There goes all your profit in the entire laptop category for the day for the store.
[3258.38 --> 3259.82]  I'm assuming Acer is selling it directly.
[3260.34 --> 3262.62]  I would have assumed that too, but I don't think so.
[3263.02 --> 3263.36]  Wow.
[3263.44 --> 3265.26]  I think they're trying to go – because they're a channel company.
[3265.50 --> 3265.96]  Right, right, right.
[3265.96 --> 3267.56]  I don't think they've ever sold anything directly.
[3268.12 --> 3271.10]  I mean, they have an online – oh, actually, does Acer even have an online store?
[3272.02 --> 3274.52]  I think they have to figure that out.
[3274.58 --> 3277.02]  I think they have to go direct for something like this.
[3277.02 --> 3280.52]  So what I heard was – because they had pre-announced this a while back, right?
[3280.52 --> 3284.38]  But the CES was the actual proper – this is an actual thing.
[3284.38 --> 3284.92]  It's on sale.
[3284.92 --> 3287.60]  I think they've shown it in person before, but this was my first hands-on, and they
[3287.60 --> 3288.54]  had like two of them there.
[3288.70 --> 3290.56]  It's a more real piece of hardware now.
[3290.78 --> 3292.42]  I knew it was real when John did a video on it.
[3292.50 --> 3292.68]  Right.
[3293.14 --> 3297.56]  So the idea here is that for $9,000, you're getting an i7.
[3297.90 --> 3298.40]  $9,000.
[3298.94 --> 3300.50]  Too bad it's not over $9,000, but whatever.
[3300.88 --> 3302.54]  So 21-inch display.
[3302.76 --> 3303.00]  Yeah.
[3303.14 --> 3304.22]  You've got dual 1080s.
[3304.22 --> 3304.42]  Curved.
[3304.74 --> 3305.20]  Curved display.
[3305.26 --> 3306.08]  I mean, of course, naturally.
[3306.20 --> 3306.34]  Yeah.
[3306.70 --> 3307.92]  It's got a mechanical keyboard.
[3308.20 --> 3308.48]  Yeah.
[3308.84 --> 3310.30]  Is it not terrible or no?
[3310.40 --> 3310.84]  Yeah, it's fine.
[3311.06 --> 3311.66]  Okay, it's fine.
[3311.72 --> 3312.20]  Cherry MX Brown.
[3312.34 --> 3314.32]  Yeah, I was about to say you can fit like full-size keys.
[3314.58 --> 3314.76]  Yeah.
[3315.04 --> 3318.36]  It doesn't have like three or four drive.
[3319.38 --> 3321.04]  Isn't there like multiple PCI?
[3321.04 --> 3325.02]  Dual NVMe, and then I think it also has a two and a half inch, and then I'm not sure
[3325.02 --> 3325.72]  about anything else.
[3325.96 --> 3326.20]  Okay.
[3326.38 --> 3326.56]  Yeah.
[3326.66 --> 3330.18]  So this thing is ridiculous, and I love it because of that.
[3330.26 --> 3330.42]  Yeah.
[3330.76 --> 3337.38]  Like this feels like what when I first started going to CES way back in 1973, the thing was
[3337.38 --> 3338.50]  things were exciting.
[3338.80 --> 3338.96]  Yeah.
[3338.98 --> 3342.74]  And part of it was because I was like minus 14 years old, but like the exciting part was
[3342.74 --> 3345.54]  look at all this crazy wild stuff that's coming out.
[3345.54 --> 3347.58]  And I feel like CES is so safe now.
[3347.64 --> 3350.50]  It's like, oh, look, this laptop is marginally thinner.
[3350.50 --> 3351.94]  Or this phone is slightly faster.
[3352.30 --> 3352.36]  Different hinge.
[3352.36 --> 3353.22]  This is crazy.
[3353.58 --> 3353.72]  Yeah.
[3353.72 --> 3354.24]  This is cool.
[3354.40 --> 3354.84]  I love that.
[3354.84 --> 3355.42]  Pushing the limits.
[3355.74 --> 3356.10]  Absolutely.
[3356.34 --> 3357.38]  And that's what tech should be about.
[3357.48 --> 3358.66]  That's what CES should be about.
[3358.98 --> 3360.92]  This is, I absolutely love everything about this.
[3361.04 --> 3361.12]  It's goofy.
[3361.12 --> 3362.40]  This has been a great CES, actually.
[3362.58 --> 3363.42]  It's not bad, man.
[3363.48 --> 3363.76]  It's not bad.
[3363.76 --> 3364.16]  I'm having a lot of fun.
[3364.38 --> 3367.70]  I mean, my voice has been completely dead all day, but besides that, it's not bad.
[3368.08 --> 3369.56]  But no, this thing is awesome.
[3369.70 --> 3371.50]  I'm totally sad that I haven't seen it yet.
[3371.94 --> 3372.50]  Is it Acer?
[3373.78 --> 3374.40]  They're sweet?
[3374.98 --> 3375.50]  It's sad.
[3375.50 --> 3378.66]  So I had never actually visited them at CES before.
[3378.92 --> 3379.02]  Yeah.
[3379.12 --> 3384.28]  They rent out the entire floor of, I forget exactly where we were, but it's like...
[3384.28 --> 3385.16]  It's like a proper space.
[3385.60 --> 3386.00]  Huge.
[3386.10 --> 3386.30]  Okay.
[3386.92 --> 3387.16]  Huge.
[3387.16 --> 3389.50]  I'm going to have to go try to swing by and see that tomorrow, because that sounds awesome.
[3389.64 --> 3394.10]  If you need a contact there, I'll let you know after the show.
[3394.16 --> 3396.26]  So can I chime in with something that I saw at CES?
[3396.36 --> 3396.70]  Yes.
[3396.70 --> 3398.70]  Have you checked out Faraday Future?
[3399.14 --> 3399.40]  No.
[3399.76 --> 3400.02]  Okay.
[3400.38 --> 3401.50]  Do you know anything about Faraday Future?
[3401.72 --> 3401.94]  No.
[3402.14 --> 3402.38]  Okay.
[3402.66 --> 3402.90]  So...
[3402.90 --> 3403.14]  Hit me.
[3403.56 --> 3409.10]  Basically, Faraday Future is a new company that has a lot of former Tesla employees.
[3409.30 --> 3412.94]  Essentially, what they're doing is they're building, I would say, a competitor to the
[3412.94 --> 3414.18]  Tesla Model X, right?
[3414.46 --> 3414.74]  Okay.
[3414.94 --> 3418.42]  So it's got some goofy names, like FF91 or something.
[3418.58 --> 3419.72]  I probably butchered that.
[3420.14 --> 3424.36]  But basically, what they're doing is they're launching, it's a luxury SUV, fully electric,
[3424.54 --> 3424.76]  right?
[3425.16 --> 3425.38]  Okay.
[3425.38 --> 3428.48]  So they're definitely taking notes out of Tesla's playbook, right?
[3428.48 --> 3428.60]  Yeah.
[3428.68 --> 3430.16]  I mean, it's a fully electric vehicle.
[3430.34 --> 3430.94]  It's very expensive.
[3431.18 --> 3431.96]  It's got screens and stuff.
[3432.16 --> 3434.40]  But these guys have kind of taken it to the next level.
[3434.56 --> 3435.48]  So you've never seen this at all?
[3435.68 --> 3435.88]  No.
[3436.14 --> 3438.16]  Look up a picture of it, and I want your initial reaction.
[3438.24 --> 3441.78]  If you can screen, because it's a polarizing design for sure.
[3442.26 --> 3443.06]  What they've done is...
[3443.06 --> 3443.28]  Okay.
[3443.28 --> 3443.34]  Okay.
[3443.34 --> 3443.94]  I'm screen sharing.
[3444.18 --> 3444.34]  Okay.
[3444.38 --> 3444.54]  All right.
[3444.56 --> 3444.98]  Let's do it.
[3445.00 --> 3445.28]  Let's do it.
[3445.28 --> 3445.88]  Let's do it live.
[3445.96 --> 3446.64]  What am I looking for?
[3446.68 --> 3447.18]  Faraday Future.
[3447.66 --> 3448.14]  Faraday Future.
[3448.14 --> 3449.44]  I believe it's the FF90.
[3449.80 --> 3451.36]  Does anyone know Faraday Future?
[3451.50 --> 3452.24]  Is it FF91?
[3453.24 --> 3453.64]  F91.
[3455.38 --> 3458.18]  I mean, they only announced it the other day.
[3458.24 --> 3461.78]  They actually had a disastrous press launch where it was supposed to park itself, and it
[3461.78 --> 3462.04]  didn't.
[3462.46 --> 3464.32]  It looks like a Batmobile.
[3465.24 --> 3465.78]  There you go.
[3465.82 --> 3466.04]  There you go.
[3466.06 --> 3466.62]  No, it doesn't.
[3466.68 --> 3468.98]  It looks like something out of Tron, maybe?
[3469.24 --> 3469.60]  It's...
[3469.60 --> 3470.82]  Or something out of...
[3470.82 --> 3472.56]  I don't even know what it's...
[3472.56 --> 3472.80]  Yeah.
[3472.90 --> 3473.92]  It's super unique looking.
[3474.02 --> 3475.22]  Honestly, I will say this.
[3475.42 --> 3477.74]  I saw the pictures, and I'm like, that is hilariously ugly.
[3478.26 --> 3480.18]  Saw in person, it's not that bad.
[3480.26 --> 3481.50]  I mean, it's still enormous.
[3481.60 --> 3483.06]  So it's super long, right?
[3483.06 --> 3487.24]  So they have models with two and three rows of seats, but if you get the two row, you're
[3487.24 --> 3489.62]  basically seeing a first class airline seat.
[3489.78 --> 3491.54]  It is massive back there.
[3492.12 --> 3493.70]  So we got to check it out.
[3493.80 --> 3494.82]  Marquez and I had...
[3494.82 --> 3497.12]  Actually, Marquez did a full video, if you guys want to go check that out.
[3497.42 --> 3499.28]  He went really in depth on it and the whole thing.
[3499.38 --> 3502.04]  But essentially, there are a couple of the cars around.
[3502.16 --> 3504.88]  There's one actually at the show floor where you can take a look, and that's the one I think
[3504.88 --> 3507.54]  that you're looking at right there, where it's like the full exterior.
[3508.36 --> 3509.96]  So this is all LED.
[3510.24 --> 3510.68]  Here, hold on.
[3510.74 --> 3513.16]  Let me go back to share with them again.
[3513.22 --> 3513.58]  Yeah, yeah.
[3513.62 --> 3516.18]  So basically, the whole grille right here is all LED.
[3517.36 --> 3518.04]  There are also...
[3518.04 --> 3519.94]  There's like a lidar that pops out of the hood.
[3520.56 --> 3523.32]  There are lights below for the inductive charging.
[3523.82 --> 3524.94]  On the side, there are LEDs.
[3525.40 --> 3527.62]  I believe they said that there are 13 different displays.
[3528.16 --> 3529.54]  Like on the doors, there are displays.
[3530.02 --> 3533.72]  When you sit in the car, each person has their own display in the door where they can change
[3533.72 --> 3534.88]  like the heated seats and stuff.
[3535.06 --> 3535.86]  This thing is wild.
[3535.98 --> 3536.56]  It's crazy.
[3537.12 --> 3538.02]  But the cool part is...
[3538.02 --> 3540.82]  So this is the one with the fully done interior and exterior.
[3541.54 --> 3543.94]  They said it's basically what the production car is going to look like.
[3544.02 --> 3545.32]  And this is going to be shipping...
[3545.32 --> 3548.48]  I believe you can actually purchase one already if you pre-order.
[3548.96 --> 3552.02]  I don't know what the actual price is going to be, but I know that you can drop $5,000
[3552.02 --> 3554.84]  on a pre-order, which of course, you know, for a car.
[3555.28 --> 3557.56]  But what we actually got to do, what was cool, was we actually get to
[3557.56 --> 3558.22]  driving it.
[3558.42 --> 3558.60]  Really?
[3558.60 --> 3562.10]  So they had a couple of sort of beta models of the car.
[3562.54 --> 3564.24]  So the first one was the autonomous driving.
[3564.30 --> 3565.84]  I think it was the same one that they showed.
[3566.28 --> 3568.64]  So at their actual press conference, I think...
[3568.64 --> 3571.52]  I didn't actually watch it, but what I heard is that they did it twice,
[3571.82 --> 3573.06]  and one of the times it failed.
[3573.62 --> 3574.70]  Yeah, I heard that, yeah.
[3574.72 --> 3575.80]  But we actually got to do it.
[3576.04 --> 3577.62]  It was a fairly simple demo, honestly.
[3577.76 --> 3578.68]  It was not anything crazy.
[3578.76 --> 3582.10]  We basically got in the car, it drove around the parking lot, found a spot, pulled in.
[3582.34 --> 3582.82]  Okay, sure.
[3582.82 --> 3583.46]  Not crazy.
[3583.90 --> 3584.08]  Cool.
[3584.58 --> 3587.44]  What was really cool is we actually got to drive in the performance test.
[3587.82 --> 3591.80]  So they had this giant, like, basically airline hanger looking thing, right?
[3591.96 --> 3595.16]  It wasn't an actual airline hanger, but a huge inside space.
[3595.34 --> 3596.32]  It was all kind of roped off.
[3596.68 --> 3600.86]  So the main test driver, who's doing all the shakedown, super passionate guy, right?
[3600.92 --> 3604.62]  And if you watch Marquez's video, you'll see he's the guy who's actually driving the car.
[3605.20 --> 3607.64]  So we did a little, you know, kind of like driving around.
[3608.02 --> 3609.78]  Mind you, this is an enormous vehicle, right?
[3609.78 --> 3610.90]  It's hard to get an idea.
[3611.30 --> 3613.54]  Like, for scale, maybe like a Chevy Suburban.
[3613.68 --> 3614.44]  It's like something like that.
[3614.52 --> 3614.80]  Whoa.
[3614.98 --> 3616.28]  It's much bigger than a Model X.
[3616.46 --> 3617.30]  Now, I don't know the exact.
[3617.30 --> 3617.34]  Oh, I see.
[3617.48 --> 3617.68]  Okay.
[3617.84 --> 3618.40]  It's huge.
[3618.48 --> 3621.34]  And you can kind of see in the pictures where it's like it's very long and stretched, right?
[3621.34 --> 3621.54]  Sure.
[3621.70 --> 3621.92]  Okay.
[3621.94 --> 3622.76]  A big, big vehicle.
[3623.06 --> 3623.92]  All season tires.
[3624.24 --> 3626.50]  Like, this is not, like, this should not be a crazy performance vehicle.
[3626.82 --> 3629.30]  So we started doing like some skid pad stuff, some slalom stuff.
[3629.46 --> 3630.24]  Then we did a launch.
[3630.70 --> 3633.46]  This thing is unbelievably fast.
[3633.74 --> 3633.98]  Huh.
[3634.10 --> 3635.86]  So have you ever done like a launch like a Tesla?
[3636.16 --> 3638.08]  I have never been inside a Tesla.
[3638.26 --> 3638.52]  Never.
[3638.68 --> 3638.92]  Really?
[3639.26 --> 3640.22]  You should do that.
[3640.72 --> 3641.56]  But, okay.
[3641.68 --> 3642.76]  So Teslas are fast.
[3642.82 --> 3646.40]  And one of the things that make electric cars really quick is that the fact that they get that instant torque, right?
[3646.40 --> 3646.52]  Yeah.
[3646.52 --> 3647.34]  You hit the motor.
[3647.52 --> 3649.22]  It's not like it's got to spin up and change gears.
[3649.34 --> 3651.20]  You get 100% of power immediately.
[3651.82 --> 3660.04]  So this giant, giant car SUV crossover, whatever you want to call it, will do 0 to 60 in 2.3 seconds.
[3660.04 --> 3660.28]  What?
[3660.96 --> 3661.50]  2.3.
[3661.88 --> 3665.22]  For comparison, that Lamborghini you did is probably somewhere in the 3 second range.
[3665.24 --> 3665.48]  Yeah.
[3665.84 --> 3666.48]  No, no.
[3666.64 --> 3667.76]  It's much slower than that.
[3667.98 --> 3668.16]  Yeah.
[3668.34 --> 3668.54]  Yeah.
[3668.68 --> 3669.72]  So hold on.
[3669.74 --> 3671.68]  Well, let's look it up because I'm pretty sure.
[3671.68 --> 3676.80]  2.39 is what they quoted, which seems kind of cheeky because the Tesla will do 2.4.
[3676.88 --> 3678.42]  So like 2.4, how slow?
[3678.50 --> 3679.38]  We do 2.39.
[3680.08 --> 3680.82]  Like it makes a difference.
[3681.22 --> 3683.38]  But this thing launches unbelievably fast.
[3683.90 --> 3687.06]  It is an enormous, enormous vehicle on all season tires.
[3687.88 --> 3688.40]  It was unreal.
[3688.40 --> 3696.08]  It's like when they launched it, like it really felt like, have you ever been on like one of those roller coaster rides where it's like you're at a stop and it'll like launch you?
[3696.54 --> 3701.98]  Like it's just like that instant, immediate, like that first half second where you like go from 0 to like 30 it feels like.
[3702.22 --> 3702.84]  It was crazy.
[3703.10 --> 3705.84]  And I've been in Tesla's and I mean it's not crazy different.
[3706.28 --> 3707.74]  But the difference is this thing is enormous.
[3708.08 --> 3708.64]  No, you're right.
[3708.74 --> 3709.02]  You're right.
[3709.02 --> 3711.48]  Yeah, it's probably somewhere in the sort of –
[3711.48 --> 3712.14]  In the three-ish range.
[3712.14 --> 3712.62]  You have the Aventador.
[3712.82 --> 3714.32]  I don't think I see the –
[3714.32 --> 3715.34]  You have the –
[3715.34 --> 3716.02]  I was in the Gallardo.
[3716.60 --> 3717.24]  Yeah, the Gallardo.
[3717.36 --> 3719.14]  It's going to be three, maybe low four.
[3719.38 --> 3720.80]  But this thing is 2.4 seconds.
[3720.90 --> 3721.70]  It's 2.39.
[3722.26 --> 3730.94]  Farid of Future is a company that has a lot of issues as far as like the whole – like they're trying to build like a factory in north Las Vegas, which apparently they've been having a lot of issues with.
[3731.34 --> 3731.74]  Funding.
[3731.74 --> 3733.86]  There's like – there's a lot of like behind the scenes thing.
[3734.20 --> 3736.38]  But keep in mind this company is brand new, right?
[3736.42 --> 3737.58]  They've never created anything.
[3738.08 --> 3740.46]  One of the guys said that there are 1,500 employees already.
[3740.94 --> 3744.60]  Like this is the first car, but obviously the idea is that they're going to be building more.
[3744.72 --> 3746.54]  Like they've got the chassis and the motors and stuff.
[3746.84 --> 3748.28]  This guy has like 1,000 horsepower by the way.
[3748.62 --> 3754.00]  And it's supposed to have I think 130 kilowatt hour battery, which is probably why it's so long.
[3754.28 --> 3754.62]  Right.
[3754.92 --> 3756.34]  It's a super interesting thing.
[3756.60 --> 3761.10]  I think a lot of people are afraid that it's going to be vapor and that the company may not actually be able to pull through.
[3761.10 --> 3764.28]  But from what I saw, they've got something cool here.
[3764.52 --> 3769.00]  I think it's a little bit polarizing on the looks front.
[3769.32 --> 3770.86]  But the interior that I saw was cool.
[3771.00 --> 3772.96]  But most importantly, the performance is real.
[3773.12 --> 3777.40]  Like it's an actual thing that they are – it might not be ready for primetime.
[3778.02 --> 3780.42]  Next year, it might not be ready to actually be on sale.
[3780.88 --> 3789.50]  But it was really surprising after hearing all like the negative stuff around because, I mean, they're a fairly private company right now since they actually haven't like released a product.
[3789.50 --> 3796.18]  But I've got to say for everything I've seen at CES so far besides one thing which is going to be in a video soon I can't talk about.
[3796.34 --> 3799.34]  But besides that, this is one of the coolest things I saw.
[3799.74 --> 3799.96]  Okay.
[3800.10 --> 3800.38]  So, yeah.
[3800.42 --> 3802.74]  That's significantly faster than my motorcycle.
[3803.12 --> 3803.74]  What do you have?
[3804.02 --> 3805.62]  It's an SV650S.
[3805.72 --> 3810.58]  And I think that gets – just looking it up online, somewhere in the neighborhood of 3.3 seconds.
[3810.66 --> 3811.72]  Which is insanely fast.
[3811.86 --> 3812.00]  Yeah.
[3812.00 --> 3815.36]  But this is like a giant, giant SUV essentially.
[3815.58 --> 3816.46]  Like a boat basically.
[3816.46 --> 3816.66]  Exactly.
[3817.30 --> 3817.48]  Wow.
[3817.48 --> 3817.90]  It's crazy.
[3818.04 --> 3818.60]  A thousand horsepower.
[3819.34 --> 3819.88]  A thousand horsepower.
[3821.34 --> 3821.68]  So, yeah.
[3821.72 --> 3822.12]  Fascinating.
[3822.20 --> 3825.08]  That is one of the coolest things I've seen in a while.
[3825.30 --> 3828.58]  I did not expect it to be as actually legit as it was.
[3828.88 --> 3830.46]  Here's a cool thing that I saw.
[3831.16 --> 3834.72]  LG has abandoned the modular smartphone concept after one attempt.
[3834.72 --> 3843.88]  So, in response to all the haters that I got on my G5 review, which was not a very positive review.
[3843.96 --> 3846.94]  I did get a couple things sort of wrong, which happens from time to time.
[3847.12 --> 3847.74]  You know how it is.
[3848.44 --> 3848.68]  No.
[3849.24 --> 3849.60]  I've never had anything wrong.
[3849.60 --> 3852.04]  In response to all the haters, this is the best thing ever.
[3852.26 --> 3853.90]  My friends and I all own G5s.
[3853.92 --> 3855.42]  We think it's the best thing since sliced bread.
[3856.38 --> 3860.14]  Apparently, more people agreed with me because it's dead.
[3860.80 --> 3863.38]  The thing was they didn't really do it right.
[3863.66 --> 3863.82]  No.
[3863.82 --> 3867.22]  They immediately got upstaged by the Moto Z, which you just snap it on.
[3867.46 --> 3868.66]  You've played with the Moto Z, right?
[3868.72 --> 3868.96]  I have.
[3869.30 --> 3876.18]  It's a much better way of doing it versus turning the phone off, taking it out, clipping on with the battery, which always felt to me like this is not going to last.
[3876.18 --> 3877.12]  Like you're going to break it.
[3877.24 --> 3877.54]  Yes.
[3877.82 --> 3879.48]  And then you have to put it back in and reboot it.
[3879.58 --> 3882.08]  And then it was always like everything had to be on the bottom, right?
[3882.36 --> 3884.88]  Whereas being able to snap stuff on the back I think was a better solution.
[3885.12 --> 3885.46]  Very cool.
[3885.50 --> 3889.78]  And plus, not only that, but Project R died a couple months ago, right?
[3889.78 --> 3889.90]  Yeah.
[3890.24 --> 3892.86]  So, the modular smartphone thing, I don't know.
[3892.86 --> 3894.84]  So, they're trying to go modular smartphone.
[3895.02 --> 3898.12]  And at the same time, Apple's getting even tighter integrated.
[3898.82 --> 3901.48]  And now we're waterproof and we're this and we're that.
[3901.70 --> 3906.68]  And it's hard to compete with a purpose-built device.
[3906.68 --> 3915.90]  For mainstream consumer stuff, the idea of being able to open it up and to be modular and to be able to customize it, I feel like that battle was lost a while ago.
[3916.30 --> 3917.54]  For enthusiasts, sure.
[3917.66 --> 3921.36]  But for mainstream stuff, like you can't – there's not a whole lot you can do.
[3921.46 --> 3923.48]  Like if you open that laptop, what can you do to it?
[3923.64 --> 3925.70]  I can change the SSD and the wireless card.
[3926.10 --> 3926.40]  Perfect.
[3927.04 --> 3928.50]  Super awesomely upgradable, right?
[3928.82 --> 3928.98]  Yeah.
[3928.98 --> 3931.22]  And this is not even like a mainstream laptop, I would argue.
[3931.30 --> 3932.36]  Like this is very high-end.
[3932.46 --> 3933.40]  This is something that –
[3933.40 --> 3933.90]  Yeah.
[3934.52 --> 3939.58]  So, I feel like with something like a smartphone, modularity is cool.
[3939.96 --> 3944.48]  But like something like Project R always kind of struck me as a thing where it's like this is a cool idea in theory.
[3944.82 --> 3945.14]  And good luck.
[3945.14 --> 3947.66]  But like who is exactly going to buy this phone?
[3947.88 --> 3948.10]  Yeah.
[3948.64 --> 3949.16]  So, I don't know.
[3949.62 --> 3951.36]  The G5 was a cool phone.
[3951.50 --> 3953.22]  I didn't really dislike it that much.
[3953.30 --> 3954.86]  I just thought that it was a little goofy.
[3955.10 --> 3957.86]  And I also didn't like the sort of plastic metal finish on it.
[3957.90 --> 3958.08]  Right.
[3958.42 --> 3959.66]  But I'm not surprised.
[3960.18 --> 3960.68]  I'm not surprised.
[3961.24 --> 3961.52]  Okay.
[3961.74 --> 3964.64]  Well, I think that's pretty much it for my topics.
[3964.76 --> 3966.00]  I mean there's a couple other little things.
[3966.18 --> 3968.40]  There's a new HDMI spec, 2.1.
[3968.40 --> 3968.88]  2.1.
[3969.02 --> 3970.52]  And that's actually 8K ready, right?
[3970.64 --> 3971.22]  Yes, it is.
[3971.38 --> 3972.06]  So –
[3972.06 --> 3975.18]  Dynamic HDR, 8K resolution, and more.
[3975.54 --> 3976.70]  And more, my favorite part.
[3977.82 --> 3981.48]  Also, that shiny new wallpaper TV, blah, blah, blah.
[3981.50 --> 3982.18]  I've got to go check that.
[3982.20 --> 3983.02]  Is that the LG booth?
[3983.22 --> 3983.58]  Yeah.
[3983.72 --> 3983.90]  Yeah, dude.
[3983.90 --> 3984.72]  I've got to check that.
[3984.72 --> 3985.80]  Don't expect any updates.
[3986.20 --> 3987.74]  And it's out of date already, basically.
[3987.94 --> 3988.76]  HDMI 2.1.
[3988.86 --> 3989.32]  So, there you go.
[3989.44 --> 3993.58]  I mean it doesn't matter because you don't need 8K support on a 4K TV.
[3994.54 --> 3994.68]  But –
[3994.68 --> 3995.56]  Is that how that works?
[3995.70 --> 3996.02]  You know –
[3996.02 --> 3997.02]  More pixels are always better, right?
[3997.02 --> 4002.34]  Honestly, I'm frustrated at the way that the TV makers treat TVs like a one year and done.
[4002.50 --> 4003.34]  Oh, dude.
[4003.58 --> 4003.94]  Absolutely.
[4004.42 --> 4005.56]  So, I asked LG.
[4005.56 --> 4007.18]  I was like, hey, so the signature.
[4007.76 --> 4015.18]  Is that getting support for those two additional HDR formats that the new TVs or the 2017 models are getting?
[4015.46 --> 4017.10]  Like, they're like, no.
[4018.00 --> 4020.56]  And I'm like, you understand this is an $8,000 product, right?
[4020.74 --> 4021.54]  On some level.
[4022.06 --> 4023.02]  You know what surprises me?
[4023.54 --> 4025.00]  Same thing with cars, right?
[4025.12 --> 4025.28]  Yeah.
[4025.36 --> 4029.84]  So, you can buy a car and it's like the next year there's like, oh, look, we're adding like Android Auto on CarPlay.
[4030.18 --> 4031.34]  Seems like it should be a software update.
[4031.42 --> 4031.76]  Like, oh, no.
[4031.76 --> 4032.44]  You have to buy a new car.
[4032.76 --> 4032.98]  Yeah.
[4033.50 --> 4034.78]  It's like, are you kidding me?
[4034.78 --> 4051.48]  It's like, I feel like the reason, aside from just being cheapskates, like not investing the R&D, I feel like the main reason is actually this incredibly myopic attempt to not cannibalize sales of the new product.
[4051.74 --> 4051.82]  Yeah.
[4051.82 --> 4063.88]  And what it demonstrates to me is a complete and utter lack of understanding of what the upgrade cycle for a major purchase, like a high-end TV or a car would be.
[4063.98 --> 4064.22]  Right.
[4064.32 --> 4065.72]  That's not a yearly thing.
[4065.92 --> 4066.20]  No.
[4067.22 --> 4074.72]  A 20, basically all you've done, you haven't incentivized a 2016 customer to get your new OLED.
[4074.72 --> 4081.86]  You have given them a gigantic, like, three-inch girth dildo up the butt.
[4082.36 --> 4083.28]  That's pretty accurate.
[4083.42 --> 4084.30]  For buying from you.
[4084.62 --> 4085.50]  That's what you've done.
[4086.72 --> 4087.16]  Yeah.
[4087.46 --> 4087.88]  I agree.
[4087.98 --> 4088.78]  You screwed them.
[4089.42 --> 4090.96]  You bent them over and screwed them.
[4091.96 --> 4098.62]  And then, what, you expect them to care that you added some stupid new feature that you're not giving to them because you're a jerk?
[4098.62 --> 4102.88]  And when it's actually time for them to replace that TV in five years?
[4103.02 --> 4103.20]  Right.
[4103.54 --> 4104.84]  You think they want to come to you?
[4105.16 --> 4108.62]  I mean, they don't really have a choice because nobody's doing this properly right now.
[4108.74 --> 4108.90]  Right.
[4109.04 --> 4109.78]  But five years from now?
[4112.00 --> 4112.36]  Frustrating.
[4112.72 --> 4113.10]  I don't know, man.
[4113.64 --> 4113.98]  I don't know.
[4114.08 --> 4115.06]  So that's my take on that.
[4115.14 --> 4116.28]  That's just a short rant.
[4116.64 --> 4116.82]  Yeah.
[4117.00 --> 4118.16]  So I think that's pretty much it.
[4118.68 --> 4120.88]  Thank you guys very much for watching the WAN show.
[4120.98 --> 4122.48]  A huge shout-out to Austin.
[4122.48 --> 4128.92]  You guys got to go check him out over at AustinNotDuncan33303.
[4129.04 --> 4130.28]  You tell them where to find you.
[4130.36 --> 4130.58]  I don't know.
[4131.40 --> 4132.48]  Austin Evans on YouTube?
[4132.60 --> 4133.08]  That's right.
[4133.30 --> 4134.22]  That's all that really matters.
[4134.24 --> 4134.42]  Hey, guys.
[4134.80 --> 4135.54]  Hey, guys.
[4135.60 --> 4137.18]  This is Austin, and I have no voice.
[4138.22 --> 4139.04]  Hey, guys.
[4139.08 --> 4141.70]  This is Austin, and I'm annoying.
[4142.64 --> 4142.80]  Yeah.
[4143.28 --> 4144.82]  Completely accurate on all fronts.
[4144.96 --> 4146.10]  So you guys go check him out.
[4146.16 --> 4149.28]  He's going to have presumably at least one video from CES.
[4149.36 --> 4150.98]  He's been down here for like four days already.
[4150.98 --> 4153.36]  I've already shot three videos, but they're all being spaced out.
[4153.38 --> 4153.60]  Yeah.
[4153.78 --> 4155.00]  I'm just spacing them out.
[4155.02 --> 4158.86]  The content calendar, the schedule, production, words.
[4159.04 --> 4160.18]  I've got like a team.
[4160.28 --> 4161.58]  We've got to have like a meeting.
[4162.04 --> 4165.28]  Well, to be fair, we are supposed to be editing a video right now, and people are texting me
[4165.28 --> 4166.92]  that the video's due, and I'm like here with you.
[4167.24 --> 4168.74]  So I'll let you go.
[4168.86 --> 4169.14]  All right.
[4169.42 --> 4173.26]  Thanks, guys, for tuning in to the WAN show, and we will see you again next week.
[4174.02 --> 4177.58]  Not at the same time, but definitely on the same channel.
[4177.58 --> 4179.46]  Probably with 100% more Luke, I hope.
[4179.70 --> 4179.94]  Yeah.
[4180.16 --> 4180.76]  I hope so.
[4181.14 --> 4182.88]  He's in pretty rough shape.
[4183.32 --> 4183.92]  Poor guy.
[4184.28 --> 4185.62]  He's got to get up so early tomorrow, man.
