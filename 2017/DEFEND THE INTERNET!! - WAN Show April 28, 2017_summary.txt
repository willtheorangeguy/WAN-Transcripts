• The FCC's proposal to reverse Title II net neutrality rules was briefly discussed
• The original rule of net neutrality was established prior to 2015 and strengthened by classifying ISPs as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934.
• In 2015, the FCC decided to regulate ISPs under Title II, making regulations stricter regarding what they can do.
• The current proposal is to roll back these regulations and go back to regulating ISPs under Section 706 of the 1996 Communications Act.
• The telecommunications industry opposes this change because it would allow the government to pick and choose which aspects of the law apply to broadband services.
