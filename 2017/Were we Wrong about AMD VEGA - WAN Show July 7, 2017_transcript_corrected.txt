[0.00 → 2.00] Vicki
[2.12 → 3.12] Hello!
[3.12 → 6.32] Wood wood wood! It's WAN Showtime again my friends!
[7.06 → 10.88] And also all of you people who are watching because, you know, let's face it
[11.46 → 15.88] You and I are the one-no, I'm saying that we're like we're friends. Oh, okay. I'm not saying we're not
[15.88 → 21.08] You're just- But they're internet friends. You-yes, they're internet friends, but that is totally a different classification
[21.60 → 27.40] Jake calls me an internet friend. Does he really? He does. Even though you actually are in the same building as each other
[27.40 → 30.84] Literally. At least like four to six hours a day. And the first time I met him was in person.
[30.84 → 38.56] Right. No, he's wrong. So an internet friend, we can like we can actually define this fairly easily. An internet friend to me
[38.56 → 47.84] Okay. Is someone that you had to meet first online. Okay. Okay. And that you've only seen in person either
[48.76 → 49.76] once
[49.76 → 56.64] Or if the additional times you've seen them in person were because you happened to be travelling to get there anyway
[57.40 → 64.72] Okay. Is that fair? So like a con or something. Yes. Like they're in it like you met them at a convention a while ago
[64.72 → 71.02] Or you met them online. Oh, yeah, okay. And then oh, we both happen to go to PAX. Yes. I see them at PAX once a year
[71.14 → 75.16] They're still an internet friend. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Yeah, I could see that. Yeah
[75.40 → 79.20] You got any other sort of ways to define what an internet friend is? Um
[79.20 → 84.02] Um, no, I think that's pretty good. I think you could meet them in person first still
[84.58 → 90.10] Really? Yeah, because like for instance there was at Vancouver. Okay. I met a dude who's sitting right next to me
[90.10 → 92.82] Do you have to meet them somewhere techie? Can I just jump in with that?
[92.82 → 94.82] I think that would help a lot. Okay
[94.82 → 99.04] Okay, but I think it has to do with like the percentage of interaction
[99.04 → 102.70] So I met this dude at Vancouver. Okay, we only started talking on the last day
[103.34 → 108.08] And pretty much all that happened was I was like hey, what's that game that you're playing, and he's like it's this
[108.08 → 111.92] And I was like, oh and ended up being a multiplayer game. I was like it looks pretty cool
[111.92 → 115.22] Maybe I'll get it. He was like sure. I'll play with you add me on Steam
[115.22 → 123.70] Never talked to him at all outside of that interaction in person and then only talked to him online for like years past that
[123.70 → 130.86] Okay, so I think you're pretty safely internet friend zone. Yeah, that guy. Yeah, now let me hit you with a different one. So
[130.86 → 134.74] met someone at Bible camp
[135.30 → 140.56] Okay, okay, so I'm there for like a week but see that that's the think that's one of the differentiators
[140.56 → 144.78] This isn't necessarily a techie thing that you're talking about, but you're kind of locked in this situation
[144.78 → 149.36] Yeah, you committed to go here. Yes, I had to be there. You're staying there. You actually can't leave
[149.96 → 150.64] Yeah
[150.64 → 153.16] Not allowed
[153.16 → 161.34] Not even just the payment thing. It's in like hope so you're not there's nowhere to go anyway the thing about the British Colombian city of hope
[161.34 → 166.70] Your only hope is that the name's a little ironic
[166.70 → 172.42] So okay, so I meet a girl at camp and
[173.96 → 181.28] We only talk like a few times this one time, but then we exchanged no not like that, but then we look it was Bible camp
[181.28 → 181.56] Okay
[181.56 → 183.44] Does this say Bible camp?
[183.80 → 185.88] No band camp. Oh
[185.88 → 191.56] Yeah, yeah, yeah, so we exchange MSN because that's what we had dude. I miss them in those days
[191.56 → 198.90] Oh, I miss them was so we spent the next year MSN in constantly but didn't see each other for an entire year
[198.90 → 200.34] Okay, okay
[200.34 → 204.24] Then after the following year Bible camp we start dating
[204.24 → 211.46] Is she because it develops into something else is she still an internet friend for that first year?
[211.46 → 212.94] See okay
[212.94 → 218.24] This is even more wild because I've only ever actually thought of the concept is because these are what my friends do
[218.24 → 221.14] I've only thought of the concept as internet friend as gamers
[221.14 → 222.52] right
[222.52 → 227.68] Because anyone that I had like extended conversations with that we weren't gaming
[227.68 → 230.56] Mm-hmm was like people that went to my school
[230.56 → 234.20] So they were definitely real life friends because I saw them daily got it right
[234.20 → 240.58] So I think that is a real life friend that transition to an internet friend that transition to a girlfriend
[240.58 → 247.58] That is a real life person. Okay, that's a lot of transitions. I think you guys flip-flopped a little bit. Okay. I think there was some flopping
[247.58 → 252.02] Okay, got it internet friend flopping do the friend flop. Yeah
[253.20 → 255.20] But well that's
[255.20 → 257.74] That was really not where I was going with that
[258.18 → 261.78] So we got a great show for you guys today contrary to what you might think
[261.78 → 264.28] What I mean witness that intro to it the best show?
[264.88 → 272.66] Main news topics AMD RX Vega specs leaked Wow surprising, so this is the gaming version of Vega
[274.62 → 284.50] Number two how is it just all AMD news no one saw that coming the Ry zen 5 1600 becomes the second best-selling CPU on Amazon
[284.50 → 286.50] That's actually pretty cool though
[286.50 → 288.96] Round of applause yes to AMD
[288.96 → 291.84] Congratulations like building a thing that people think is bomb
[293.02 → 295.02] All right, although
[295.44 → 304.06] This is kind of a part two of that news story the rumour has officially been squashed AMD having taking 10% market share from Intel is not a thing
[304.06 → 306.06] um
[306.06 → 308.06] and
[308.06 → 313.80] building the world's biggest lithium-ion battery in South Australia, but the Germans are building an even bigger battery
[313.80 → 317.42] But that's not going to be ready for like quite a while
[317.94 → 324.32] Elon Musk's version I think is going to be ready pretty soon and the format dictates that we should have four main news topic call-outs
[324.32 → 326.32] But I have to call this one out
[327.46 → 331.04] Canadian porn mega site porn hub becomes interactive
[331.60 → 336.98] With a new series of videos so you'll pretty much never have to leave the house again. Yeah, is
[336.98 → 343.78] Is um sort of where that might be heading all right then let's launch the intro and get into it
[343.78 → 345.78] I
[355.40 → 361.26] Had no idea that porn hub was Canadian are they really either yeah, they are I even looked it up on Wikipedia
[362.70 → 366.06] Careful with that search now. No, I'm okay now
[366.06 → 370.50] Okay, now hold on let's get this ball. See let's get the sponsor
[371.46 → 373.46] Thank you savage jerky fresh books
[375.70 → 383.02] Okay, so now let's do kind of ten steamboats to make sure that the sponsors checking to make sure we did that aren't still watching
[383.02 → 385.02] Gotta have a wee bit of a buffer. Yeah, you know
[385.02 → 391.26] We could pretend to launch into a topic about the high-tech thing that's in this box blah blah is highly related
[391.26 → 395.74] Yeah, look at this that goes in there. Okay. I think we've waited long enough
[396.06 → 398.06] Congratulations, okay, so
[398.06 → 406.50] Linus's screen so porn hub Canadian the first thing obviously is Canadian porn videos. Yeah, okay, so you can watch Canadians
[407.16 → 411.76] And Canadian babes and Canadian amateurs Canadian girls
[413.46 → 418.90] That's a bad word leaps today. I learned that porn hub is a Canadian company. This is Reddit
[421.18 → 423.18] One second
[423.18 → 425.18] I am 18 plus
[425.18 → 433.28] But I don't know for a fact that you guys are I go to Wikipedia. Okay, here we go. Okay. Okay. It's Wikipedia launched and headquartered in Montreal
[435.28 → 437.18] Go figure and here
[437.18 → 442.98] Okay, I learned something else today. Montreal is the third-largest porn producing city in the world after LA and Amsterdam
[442.98 → 449.02] Wow, I had no clue at all. I love that the first response of that so proud of my city
[449.02 → 453.02] How about that good job?
[453.02 → 457.02] Um, okay, anyway, let's get into let's get into some tech topics here first
[457.12 → 463.38] So this was originally posted by Mr. Troll on the forum and the source for this one is WCCF tech so
[464.58 → 467.34] Take it with a grain of salt as usual looks
[468.00 → 469.02] Sick
[469.02 → 472.62] I'm just going to drop that in there real quick. I really like this new design
[472.62 → 478.52] That looks a lot better than the frontier edition. It does. I love the blacked out PCI Express bracket
[478.52 → 483.62] It's little touches like that that make a big difference and actually this logo
[483.62 → 491.34] I really didn't like it black on blue it okay, but ran on black really sick like this honestly the whole time
[491.34 → 493.34] And it's just reminded me of descent
[493.34 → 498.52] Okay, you know I'm saying see I could see how you could go kind of scary eyes on it
[498.52 → 501.80] Yeah, but without being too overtly that
[502.62 → 508.52] Yeah, I like it. Yeah, it's kind of got like a Batman the animated series kind of vibe to it
[508.52 → 511.32] I think it brings the little bit of the fun
[512.08 → 516.54] Back to like how graphics cards get to look yeah, because lately it's just been like
[516.98 → 520.92] Well, the only high-performance graphics cards that have existed have been in videos
[522.00 → 527.04] And they're gray, and they are they look sharp they're black yes some
[527.04 → 532.34] Correct they're gray except when they're black, and also you get a green lighting accent. Oh, it's only green
[534.90 → 536.58] But like, and they look sharp
[536.58 → 543.86] But it's been the same thing for a really long time and like I kind of I understand that it looks a gaudy and is objectively worse
[543.98 → 549.14] But I kind of sometimes miss the old days when you'd have like the art on the graphics card
[550.16 → 553.38] Shut up you can it was fun. You can miss it was fun
[553.38 → 557.74] You can miss it in a nostalgic way, but you would not put that in your system today
[558.74 → 560.66] Admit it we should make it and no
[561.30 → 562.84] Admit it we should make a cringe build
[562.84 → 567.30] I'm not letting you change the subject admit it. You would not put that in your system today
[567.30 → 573.92] I would no you would know you wouldn't would no you wouldn't upgrade me to ten Axis. I'll do it. No
[573.92 → 579.88] They don't there aren't even any there's nothing that's bad anymore get it. There is nothing that
[579.88 → 586.18] I get a brand to skin it. Okay. Hold on. Let me see if I can find like some examples of graphics cards
[587.76 → 590.74] I'm sure they've looked into it at some point, okay
[592.50 → 598.86] Okay, not bad, but this is what we're talking about but like it's not kind of crap that used to be on high-end
[598.86 → 605.12] Okay, but pull me back out camo and like some why are these all the same thing did you look up this yeah?
[605.12 → 608.02] I looked up this specific card. Oh, hilarious. Okay this I
[609.92 → 611.92] That's fine
[611.92 → 616.52] But it's like there's like sparks coming off of it, and it looks ridiculous, but that's fine
[616.52 → 622.54] That's not like stupid like let's like okay. Let's find some game word video. I like the like
[622.54 → 628.64] Okay, they're pretty cool. Those all look fine. Okay. No, no, but let's go back to like you know
[628.64 → 632.36] 8800 yeah, we're in 8800s like look at this
[637.30 → 643.80] Looks like WWE Buddha or something literally changed their mind on what they were drawing many times
[643.80 → 649.06] And then we're just like that's fine. Just forget it. Okay. I'm you know what it screws it
[649.06 → 651.50] I'm not getting paid that much to do this anyway
[651.50 → 653.62] Yeah, yeah, exactly
[653.62 → 661.44] Like no you would not be putting that bank bull crap in your system. It's all about performance, man
[661.44 → 668.10] All right, so let's talk about some Rx Vega specs here. It's going to be shipping with a core clock of around 1630 megahertz
[668.10 → 673.16] So at what point do I people were hating on me so hard
[673.66 → 677.20] For the Vega reality check on last week's WAN show
[677.20 → 681.96] I'm not surprised like you knew that this is the professional card
[682.68 → 686.28] So it doesn't indicate about the gaming card
[686.84 → 692.82] things like that's like comparing it Nvidia squadron to a g-force in games
[694.10 → 697.70] Which you can do, and they perform the same
[701.78 → 706.70] Surprising there are some fair points there are some features that are not yet enabled on the
[707.20 → 711.32] Frontier Edition card had heads hesitated for a sec. I almost called it founders edition
[711.32 → 716.96] Yeah, there are some features that aren't enabled on the frontier edition card, and they are gaming features
[716.96 → 724.44] But what I said on the show if you actually listen is that it's not going to be making up the performance delta
[724.44 → 728.20] To give AMD a legitimate top tier competitor
[728.20 → 733.52] It's not going to get faster or enough to take on the 1080 ti
[733.52 → 736.40] I don't see that realistically happening and
[737.88 → 742.64] Something you guys have to understand as well is that Nvidia is just
[743.52 → 748.60] Toying with them at this point they are they have they are showing
[748.60 → 759.30] Volta hardware and if they have big Volta you don't have to think too critically to look back and go well
[760.58 → 764.16] Whenever they've got working hardware of a given new architecture
[764.72 → 772.22] The other size dies are only as far behind as the team tweaking and altering and
[772.22 → 774.22] finalizing them takes
[774.22 → 776.22] That's how far behind
[776.22 → 778.22] That's how far behind Volta
[778.22 → 783.22] Hardware is so by the time you can actually buy an RX Vega
[783.22 → 786.22] Nvidia is sitting there going okay, do we launch in?
[786.22 → 791.22] You know two months or like do we start announcing do we start teasing to
[791.22 → 798.22] To kill the hype train a little bit or do we have a year to sit and milk Pascal?
[798.22 → 806.22] While you know while Volta just while we take all our Volta, and we send it into the super computing space
[807.22 → 811.22] I mean to be clear. It's not like I'm rooting for Nvidia here
[811.22 → 817.22] People misunderstand me a lot of the time. It's just that I can take
[818.22 → 820.22] Things that we know and
[821.22 → 826.22] Extrapolate based on other things that we can guess or that were historically true and
[826.22 → 830.22] Make an educated guess even if I don't have the hardware in hand
[830.22 → 837.22] This is why we theorized in the past about being able to make a video about a graphics card before it comes out and how accurate that would actually be and honestly
[837.22 → 840.22] We keep joking about making it
[840.22 → 844.22] But if we did, I don't think it would be a very valuable piece of content, and we get trashed on for making it
[844.22 → 849.22] So yeah, so we're not going to do it. No, but there are times when we would have been pretty damn close very like
[849.22 → 854.22] Like freakishly close like with one piece of information like if all we knew was price. Yeah
[855.22 → 859.22] Putting together believable performance graphs based on everything else that we know
[859.22 → 867.22] Pretty, pretty solid like one thing that I did for the 1080 launch was I went around, and I asked creators
[868.22 → 873.22] What they thought the price would be or know what they thought the hardware would be in it?
[873.22 → 878.22] And what they thought the price would be right and how they thought the performance would be is and other than the
[879.22 → 881.22] Surprise of SMP
[882.22 → 888.22] Pretty accurate. It was pretty close within a hundred dollars every time within a pretty tight performance metric every time
[888.22 → 894.22] Okay, so I see a little bit of discussion in twitch chat about how we tried to do that with the rise in five
[895.22 → 904.22] We did not yeah, and it worked. Yeah, our rise in five numbers were bang on and all the stress and upset that people had
[905.22 → 909.22] About some of the cores being on one CCX and some of them being on another one ended up being
[909.22 → 916.22] Ended up being a non factor when it came to anything other than a few specific benchmarks
[916.22 → 918.22] Most of which were synthetic
[918.22 → 921.22] So you you can guess a lot
[922.22 → 925.22] Um, anyway, sorry. I will finish talking about the specs
[926.22 → 931.22] 8 gigs of HBM 2 memory, which is freaking incredible but also terrifying
[931.22 → 938.22] So it's incredible because HBM 2 is coming to a non-like AI super computing card
[938.22 → 944.22] Yeah, but terrifying because it's not going to be cheap, and I do worry about Rx Vega being price competitive
[944.22 → 949.22] If it's going to be shipping with such expensive memory. Yeah, so that'll total
[950.22 → 952.22] 484 gigabytes of memory bandwidth
[952.22 → 954.22] All righty then
[955.22 → 961.22] Um and the rumoured 3d mark 11 performance score has Rx Vega at thirty-one thousand eight hundred
[962.22 → 970.22] About four thousand ahead of the GTX 1080 and about double the score of the GTX 1070 that's now that doesn't seem right
[970.22 → 975.22] I didn't think there was that big of a difference between the seven ten seven. I mean mind you guys. This is a synthetic benchmark
[975.22 → 982.22] Um, and it has the 1080 Ti maintaining a commanding lead with over thirty-eight thousand points
[983.22 → 986.22] The rumoured cost would be six hundred dollars
[987.22 → 988.22] So right now
[989.22 → 992.22] It's hard to talk about graphics card pricing. Yeah, exactly what I was just going to say
[993.22 → 997.22] 1080 Ti on Amazon.com looks like it's about 900 to 950
[998.22 → 1001.22] Uh 1080 Ti on New egg right here looks like it's about
[1001.22 → 1006.22] 750 plus maybe a little bit depending on what version you get they do have stock
[1006.22 → 1010.22] So it looks like miners are not buying these very high-end cards at least
[1011.22 → 1014.22] Uh in stock limit two per customer. So if it can come in
[1016.22 → 1020.22] Within spitting distance of the 1080 Ti at six hundred dollars
[1021.22 → 1027.22] Then at least AMD is looking like they could have a performance competitive product though
[1027.22 → 1032.22] We still don't know necessarily anything about how a sync compute is going to shake down
[1033.22 → 1036.22] What Vulcan and DirectX 12 performance in real games is gonna look like?
[1037.22 → 1039.22] Uh, we still don't know much about how it's gonna
[1040.22 → 1045.22] Size up power consumption. So like performance per watt wise, although that doesn't look very promising
[1046.22 → 1052.22] Um might also just like barely matter because I suspect this price isn't going to stay the same at all
[1052.22 → 1059.22] Right because AMD cards right now are better the bomb mining for mining so they're just all going to vanish
[1060.22 → 1066.22] That's kind of my expectation. We'll see. Yeah, it's starting to the mining thing is starting to cool down a little bit
[1067.22 → 1070.22] It's still pretty crazy. I've heard that I can tell, but it's starting to cool down a little bit
[1070.22 → 1075.22] So we'll see by the time this actually drops how much impact it will have in regard to that blah blah blah blah blah
[1075.22 → 1076.22] But yeah
[1077.22 → 1078.22] Alright
[1079.22 → 1084.22] So, uh, this was originally posted by price and on the forums. It's a little bit more Vega news before we move on
[1085.22 → 1091.22] AMD's Raja Kauri confirms RX Vega die size at 484 millimetres squared
[1091.22 → 1096.22] So that's pretty darn big. That's a big GPU
[1097.22 → 1103.22] We actually covered this in a little bit more depth in our Nvidia GPUs through the ages as well as
[1104.22 → 1110.22] Did we do AMD GPU? Yeah, we did both of them. We did both AMD and Nvidia GPUs through the ages
[1110.22 → 1112.22] And I'm trying to pull that up right now
[1112.22 → 1117.22] But there have only been a handful of GPUs that have been bigger than about
[1117.22 → 1119.22] 500 millimetres squared
[1120.22 → 1124.22] So, oh for some reason it's prompting me for credentials here. That is
[1125.22 → 1130.22] That is very, very annoying. So I can't look it up other than to like to load up the video right now, but
[1133.22 → 1136.22] What that tells us is that AMD was
[1137.22 → 1141.22] If die size is anything to go on and a lot of the time it can be
[1141.22 → 1151.22] Because it tells us sort of how expensive the GPU is, and therefore what price bend they're probably hoping to target with the finished product and therefore
[1152.22 → 1155.22] What performance they think that they're probably going to have to compete with?
[1156.22 → 1164.22] So that tells us that AMD maybe didn't think that they were going for unprecedented performance like they would have with something like the
[1164.22 → 1168.22] R600 so that was the 2900 XT
[1169.22 → 1172.22] But hopefully I can find
[1173.22 → 1177.22] Yeah, I think this is going to be too hard to find live right now
[1177.22 → 1182.22] But it tells us that they were legitimately going for something pretty darn high end
[1182.22 → 1188.22] Yeah, unfortunately I can't, I can't find my die size
[1189.22 → 1195.22] Graph with all of them on it, but that's okay. It's a lot of graphs man. Yeah, it's a lot of graphs in this video
[1195.22 → 1201.22] So there 's's just not a lot I can do about that. Oh, I hope I'm not. Yeah, no, I'm not doing that. Okay, so
[1201.22 → 1203.22] So
[1205.22 → 1210.22] Here we go. This is part one of two of this next topic. This was posted not by nobody on the forum
[1210.22 → 1212.22] So this was an article over on Tom's Hardware
[1213.22 → 1216.22] And the Ry zen 5 1600
[1217.22 → 1219.22] Skyrockets to number two on Amazon
[1220.22 → 1222.22] And while this isn't a like
[1223.22 → 1226.22] 100% indication of you know how many of them are out there
[1226.22 → 1235.22] Pass mark submissions have increased telling us that people are out there buying AMD Ryzen CPUs which is great news
[1236.22 → 1244.22] Even though this is after Intel's reactionary move with the 7740 and the 7640
[1245.22 → 1251.22] Yeah, and like the pass mark thing that's obviously only going to be like rather hardcore people
[1251.22 → 1256.22] But being number two on Amazon is very transparent like building your build your own PC people for the most part
[1257.22 → 1265.22] But yeah with that said we actually have a review unit coming in of an all AMD entry-level gaming rig from Dell
[1266.22 → 1268.22] Okay, that's interesting, right? Yeah
[1269.22 → 1275.22] Because once you get partners like that on board that makes a lot more mainstream to Dell's the kind of company that sells boxes
[1276.22 → 1278.22] to people who
[1278.22 → 1287.22] Aren't necessarily looking at the real world performance in benchmark X and you know real world application Y
[1288.22 → 1289.22] They just want to buy a thing and have it play a game
[1290.22 → 1291.22] And they're looking for appealing specs
[1292.22 → 1295.22] And that's something that AMD did really, really well with Ry zen
[1296.22 → 1300.22] Is they not only delivered something that performs well in the benchmarks
[1301.22 → 1304.22] But they delivered something that looks great on paper
[1304.22 → 1305.22] Sounds good
[1306.22 → 1308.22] This one has eight processing cores and 16 threads
[1309.22 → 1311.22] Even if you don't understand what that means sounds like a lot
[1312.22 → 1313.22] It's a lot it's double
[1314.22 → 1315.22] That's a high number
[1316.22 → 1317.22] What the comparably priced Intel one would be
[1318.22 → 1319.22] Yeah
[1320.22 → 1321.22] That is fantastic
[1322.22 → 1323.22] Synergy
[1324.22 → 1325.22] To use probably the word they used
[1326.22 → 1328.22] Synergy between the marketing team and sales team and engineering team
[1328.22 → 1329.22] Yeah
[1329.22 → 1330.22] Yeah
[1331.22 → 1332.22] Yeah
[1333.22 → 1334.22] So you got to give them full credit for that
[1335.22 → 1337.22] And like having worked selling computers before it totally works
[1338.22 → 1339.22] Oh yeah
[1340.22 → 1341.22] And like you might even be like this one is better
[1342.22 → 1343.22] And someone will read the numbers on the sheet and be like
[1344.22 → 1345.22] I don't care
[1346.22 → 1347.22] You're trying to upsell me
[1348.22 → 1349.22] You're a jerk
[1349.22 → 1350.22] Because this one says it has more numbers
[1351.22 → 1352.22] And it's like oh
[1352.22 → 1353.22] Well then the frustrating thing is that like
[1354.22 → 1355.22] They could be right a lot of the time
[1356.22 → 1358.22] Like I was always the sales guy that was like
[1359.22 → 1360.22] I would upsell
[1361.22 → 1363.22] But I would upsell because people would walk in
[1364.22 → 1367.22] Wanting to buy an Athlon 64 3500 plus
[1368.22 → 1369.22] Or 3700 plus or whatever
[1370.22 → 1371.22] I think 3700 plus was an FX
[1372.22 → 1373.22] I worked with a different clientele
[1374.22 → 1375.22] So I was often down selling
[1375.22 → 1377.22] So they would walk in, and they would want like a single
[1378.22 → 1379.22] Like a high-end single core
[1380.22 → 1381.22] And I'd be like whoa, whoa hold on
[1382.22 → 1383.22] Okay for a hundred bucks more
[1384.22 → 1385.22] And you're already spending like $500
[1386.22 → 1388.22] For a hundred bucks more I want you to buy this
[1389.22 → 1390.22] It's an entry-level dual-core
[1391.22 → 1392.22] You're going to like it
[1393.22 → 1394.22] And they'd be like
[1395.22 → 1396.22] They'd come in the next week, and they'd be like
[1397.22 → 1398.22] Getting a new keyboard or something
[1399.22 → 1400.22] Be like holy crap
[1401.22 → 1402.22] I am so glad that you sold me that
[1403.22 → 1404.22] And I spent the extra hundred bucks
[1404.22 → 1405.22] My buddy has this one
[1406.22 → 1407.22] Because they'd be like buying whatever their friend had
[1408.22 → 1409.22] Or whatever
[1410.22 → 1411.22] They run circles around it
[1411.22 → 1412.22] He can't even believe it
[1412.22 → 1413.22] He's going to be in next week to buy one
[1414.22 → 1415.22] I'm like yeah dog
[1416.22 → 1417.22] That's what's up
[1418.22 → 1419.22] That's cool
[1420.22 → 1421.22] And like I always liked people getting a good value
[1422.22 → 1423.22] Even if I didn't necessarily get them a cheap price
[1424.22 → 1425.22] Because that to me is what spending your money smartly is about
[1426.22 → 1427.22] About not having to replace something
[1428.22 → 1430.22] Nine months or twelve months from now
[1430.22 → 1432.22] When you could have spent an extra hundred bucks now
[1433.22 → 1435.22] To keep it for two or three years
[1436.22 → 1439.22] And there's like there's some impossible metrics there
[1440.22 → 1443.22] Like I hate it when someone will come in and ask like
[1444.22 → 1447.22] Hey, I get questions about this with my 2600k old
[1447.22 → 1448.22] Yeah
[1449.22 → 1450.22] I had my 2600k for a super long time
[1451.22 → 1452.22] I was streaming with it doing all this other kind of stuff
[1453.22 → 1454.22] And they're like hey I just bought this processor
[1455.22 → 1459.22] Is this going to last me as long as your 2600k it lasted you?
[1460.22 → 1463.22] And I'm like man that is way too big of a timeframe
[1464.22 → 1465.22] It's like me to tell you yes or no
[1465.22 → 1467.22] I can't give you the right answer to the wrong question
[1468.22 → 1469.22] Yeah like this isn't
[1470.22 → 1471.22] You know?
[1471.22 → 1472.22] I can't, I really can't do this
[1472.22 → 1473.22] I don't know
[1473.22 → 1474.22] What if like randomly
[1475.22 → 1476.22] VR
[1476.22 → 1477.22] Some crazy new technology
[1477.22 → 1478.22] Yeah
[1478.22 → 1479.22] Shows up
[1479.22 → 1481.22] Yeah and unlike VR it actually like really super catches on
[1482.22 → 1483.22] And everyone's doing it
[1484.22 → 1485.22] Oh burn! Burn!
[1486.22 → 1490.22] And like only processors within the last two generations are able to do it
[1490.22 → 1494.22] Because they have some weird technology on die and yours doesn't have it
[1495.22 → 1497.22] And you're now pissed at me because I said you'd be good for that long
[1497.22 → 1499.22] Like I can't, I really can't do that
[1500.22 → 1503.22] But like there are certain things that are rather obvious
[1503.22 → 1505.22] Like hey dual cores just came out
[1506.22 → 1508.22] And look they're like way better
[1509.22 → 1511.22] At basically everything than single cores are
[1511.22 → 1515.22] But still the single most expensive computer component that I ever bought for myself
[1515.22 → 1520.22] Was an Athlon 64 4400 plus on launch
[1521.22 → 1524.22] Like before we were talking about things being like business expenses
[1525.22 → 1526.22] Yeah
[1527.22 → 1528.22] And I am also okay
[1529.22 → 1533.22] You could probably argue the two 7900 GTX's that I bought at the same time
[1534.22 → 1535.22] But
[1536.22 → 1537.22] It's two products
[1538.22 → 1540.22] And I got those I had them less than a week
[1540.22 → 1543.22] Because I bought them used off a guy who was flipping them
[1544.22 → 1546.22] And who was just like he was moving to Crossfire
[1547.22 → 1550.22] At the time Crossfire was bad
[1551.22 → 1553.22] So he was going to Crossfire
[1554.22 → 1555.22] And I
[1556.22 → 1560.22] I got them from him for like a hundred dollars below market value each
[1561.22 → 1563.22] And then I flipped them for what they were worth
[1564.22 → 1565.22] So I had them for like a week
[1565.22 → 1567.22] Just to tool around with them
[1568.22 → 1570.22] Just to bask in what it was like
[1571.22 → 1572.22] Yeah
[1572.22 → 1573.22] To run a top of the line SLI gaming setup
[1574.22 → 1575.22] And like you know
[1576.22 → 1579.22] Even though I was following all the rumours and everything like that
[1580.22 → 1581.22] The used market
[1582.22 → 1584.22] Hardware values are not the same as the retail market
[1585.22 → 1587.22] They're affected by things like rumours
[1588.22 → 1589.22] Yeah
[1589.22 → 1591.22] So as soon as a rumour dropped
[1592.22 → 1593.22] That something else was coming
[1593.22 → 1596.22] I knew that $200 was going to be dropped off the value of those
[1597.22 → 1598.22] Each of them instantly
[1599.22 → 1600.22] So I was like I was like holding on to them like this
[1601.22 → 1602.22] I was like I have to get rid of these things
[1603.22 → 1604.22] I have to get rid of these things
[1605.22 → 1606.22] But that didn't stop me from like playing Far Cry and stuff
[1607.22 → 1608.22] Yeah, yeah, yeah
[1609.22 → 1610.22] Far Cry 1?
[1611.22 → 1612.22] Yeah dawn
[1613.22 → 1615.22] It was like there were things that like really irked me about it
[1616.22 → 1617.22] Like the fact that
[1617.22 → 1620.22] There were organic creatures
[1621.22 → 1623.22] That you could hit like six times with a rocket launcher
[1624.22 → 1625.22] And they wouldn't die
[1626.22 → 1627.22] And like rocket ammo was like every game
[1628.22 → 1629.22] Like was pretty limited
[1630.22 → 1633.22] Like if I'm carrying around rocket launcher ammo
[1634.22 → 1635.22] Like let me use it
[1636.22 → 1637.22] Have fun with it a little bit
[1638.22 → 1639.22] Yeah, like it should leave a gaping crater
[1640.22 → 1641.22] The size of you know
[1642.22 → 1643.22] A freaking football helmet
[1644.22 → 1645.22] In the side of this thing at least
[1645.22 → 1646.22] Yeah, yeah
[1646.22 → 1647.22] You know?
[1650.22 → 1651.22] Anyway, sorry we...
[1652.22 → 1653.22] Wow, we are not staying on topic very well here
[1654.22 → 1655.22] That's probably a fish
[1656.22 → 1660.22] In other news, AMD's R7 1700 is in fourth place as well
[1661.22 → 1664.22] With that said, this was originally posted by RevSilverspine on the forum
[1664.22 → 1678.22] The rumour that AMD managed to gain 10.4 percentage points of CPU market share in the second quarter of 2017 is a little misleading because the data is from a self-selected survey
[1679.22 → 1682.22] And they're putting it very mildly here
[1682.22 → 1684.22] So the original article is from Seeking Alpha here
[1685.22 → 1696.22] AMD customers are more likely to self-report on AMD's increased sales and market share
[1697.22 → 1698.22] Really?
[1699.22 → 1700.22] AMD customers...
[1701.22 → 1702.22] Wow!
[1702.22 → 1712.22] I mean to be clear, any fan of any company is likely to self-report at a rate that's higher than the actual numbers would be
[1713.22 → 1716.22] But, how do I put this lightly?
[1717.22 → 1720.22] AMD fans, you guys are...
[1721.22 → 1722.22] Enthusiastic
[1722.22 → 1724.22] Very enthusiastic about AMD
[1729.22 → 1730.22] Moving on...
[1730.22 → 1731.22] Which is good, that's good
[1732.22 → 1733.22] Yeah, we need arguments on the internet
[1736.22 → 1737.22] More of them at least, you know?
[1738.22 → 1739.22] Yes, we need at least
[1740.22 → 1741.22] AMD versus Intel
[1742.22 → 1743.22] AMD versus Nvidia
[1745.22 → 1746.22] AMD
[1747.22 → 1748.22] Versus power
[1748.22 → 1749.22] Yeah
[1749.22 → 1750.22] Yeah
[1750.22 → 1751.22] And AMD versus...
[1751.22 → 1752.22] Just...
[1753.22 → 1754.22] Cyril
[1755.22 → 1756.22] Alright
[1757.22 → 1758.22] Tesla
[1759.22 → 1763.22] To build the world's biggest lithium-ion battery in South Australia
[1764.22 → 1765.22] This was posted by...
[1766.22 → 1767.22] Disatexsubo11s
[1768.22 → 1769.22] What kind of name is that?
[1769.22 → 1772.22] On the forum, the original article is from abc.au
[1772.22 → 1775.22] So, yeah, the headline there is...
[1776.22 → 1777.22] Pretty self-explanatory
[1778.22 → 1781.22] But, basically the point is that they're promising to build it in a hundred days
[1782.22 → 1783.22] Or it'll be free
[1784.22 → 1786.22] And this world's largest lithium-ion battery
[1787.22 → 1788.22] will be...
[1789.22 → 1790.22] able to store energy
[1791.22 → 1793.22] or will be used to store energy from a nearby wind farm
[1794.22 → 1798.22] And it's like the free thing, it would cost them 50 million dollars
[1799.22 → 1800.22] Yeah, so basically...
[1800.22 → 1801.22] Kind of big deal
[1801.22 → 1802.22] So, basically...
[1802.22 → 1803.22] Musk has issued a challenge to his own company
[1804.22 → 1805.22] to build it in a reasonable amount of time
[1806.22 → 1807.22] or eat the cost of it
[1807.22 → 1810.22] which will be like huge PR either way, I guess
[1811.22 → 1812.22] I think that's part of the point is
[1813.22 → 1814.22] I'm pretty sure he's sure that he can do it
[1815.22 → 1816.22] and this is a marketing stunt essentially
[1817.22 → 1818.22] for other countries
[1819.22 → 1820.22] Not necessarily other people, but for other countries
[1821.22 → 1822.22] Yeah
[1822.22 → 1823.22] To be like, look, we can beef up your infrastructure superfast
[1824.22 → 1825.22] and like...
[1825.22 → 1826.22] Right
[1826.22 → 1827.22] This is how confident we are
[1827.22 → 1828.22] And to be clear, this is a risk on both sides
[1828.22 → 1829.22] This is basically like...
[1829.22 → 1830.22] Yeah
[1830.22 → 1831.22] This is like a bet
[1831.22 → 1832.22] It's like...
[1832.22 → 1833.22] Yeah
[1833.22 → 1834.22] If I can build it in a hundred days, you pay for it
[1835.22 → 1836.22] And if I go over the time limit
[1837.22 → 1838.22] I'll pay for it
[1838.22 → 1839.22] I'll pay for it
[1839.22 → 1840.22] Yeah
[1840.22 → 1841.22] Wow
[1841.22 → 1842.22] Which is pretty wild
[1842.22 → 1844.22] It's an easy stunt for him to get this tech out there
[1844.22 → 1845.22] on a much larger scale
[1846.22 → 1848.22] than something like a home based battery
[1849.22 → 1853.22] where, sure, you're able to take advantage of off-peak grid power
[1854.22 → 1855.22] Yeah
[1855.22 → 1856.22] And then use it during peak hours, save some money, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
[1857.22 → 1858.22] No, no, this...
[1859.22 → 1863.22] Now we're talking about taking energy that was stored while it was windy
[1863.22 → 1865.22] and using it once the wind dies down
[1866.22 → 1867.22] Very freaking cool
[1867.22 → 1872.22] So South Australia has been battling power problems since a statewide blackout in September 2016
[1872.22 → 1878.22] and this could really change the way that renewable energy is stored
[1878.22 → 1879.22] So, very cool
[1880.22 → 1882.22] But, and we've got another two-parter here
[1882.22 → 1885.22] The original article here is from batteriesinternational.com
[1885.22 → 1890.22] The Germans have announced that they will be building the world's biggest battery
[1891.22 → 1892.22] In underground caverns
[1893.22 → 1894.22] Which makes it, like, even cooler
[1894.22 → 1896.22] Because it's like the battery cave
[1897.22 → 1898.22] Oh, wow
[1898.22 → 1899.22] Oh, yeah, I went there
[1899.22 → 1900.22] Did you come up with that on the spot?
[1900.22 → 1901.22] Yeah, dog
[1901.22 → 1902.22] Or was that pre-prepped?
[1903.22 → 1904.22] Oh, that's pretty good
[1905.22 → 1906.22] Thank you
[1906.22 → 1909.22] To be fair, okay, Musks is apparently going to take him a hundred days
[1909.22 → 1916.22] Today's, uh, this crazy battery cave battery, uh, is going to be done by the end of 2023
[1916.22 → 1920.22] But it'll be seven hundred milliwatt hours
[1920.22 → 1921.22] Or megawatt hours
[1921.22 → 1922.22] Excuse, milliwatt hours
[1922.22 → 1923.22] Megawatt hours
[1923.22 → 1925.22] Compared to just a hundred
[1926.22 → 1927.22] It's like a small anchor battery
[1927.22 → 1928.22] Yeah
[1928.22 → 1929.22] It's like...
[1929.22 → 1930.22] But it's in a cave!
[1930.22 → 1931.22] Yes!
[1931.22 → 1933.22] But it is the German one
[1933.22 → 1936.22] It will work better than the others
[1936.22 → 1939.22] We opened up an old bunker and just threw it in
[1939.22 → 1940.22] Yeah, that's right
[1941.22 → 1942.22] Yeah
[1943.22 → 1944.22] Outrageous!
[1944.22 → 1946.22] Oh, we should do our sponsor spot
[1946.22 → 1947.22] That's probably a solid idea
[1948.22 → 1951.22] Sponsors for today's WAN show
[1952.22 → 1954.22] Number one is FreshBooks
[1954.22 → 1955.22] Slash LTX
[1955.22 → 1957.22] Because FreshBooks is our sponsor for LTX
[1958.22 → 1961.22] FreshBooks is pretty much the way to go
[1961.22 → 1963.22] If you're a small business owner or a freelancer
[1963.22 → 1966.22] And you're looking to keep yourself organized
[1966.22 → 1967.22] Get paid faster

[1969.22 → 1972.22] So you can spend your time fixing computers
[1972.22 → 1973.22] Or teaching dance classes
[1973.22 → 1976.22] Or working on people's plumbing
[1976.22 → 1981.22] Rather than spending your time tooling around with overly complicated accounting software
[1981.22 → 1986.22] That literally actually requires an accounting program in order to operate
[1986.22 → 1987.22] Yeah
[1987.22 → 1988.22] Literally!
[1988.22 → 1989.22] Actually requires!

[2018.22 → 2020.22] I am so freaking hungry
[2020.22 → 2021.22] I am so...
[2021.22 → 2022.22] Okay
[2022.22 → 2023.22] You know what?
[2023.22 → 2024.22] Let's do Need for Seat first
[2024.22 → 2025.22] Okay
[2025.22 → 2026.22] Need for Seat!
[2026.22 → 2029.22] Makers of the Taxonomic line of chairs that you've probably seen featured on Linus Tech Tips
[2030.22 → 2031.22] Many, many times
[2032.22 → 2034.22] Especially in my office
[2034.22 → 2037.22] So I actually love that chair
[2037.22 → 2038.22] Yeah
[2039.22 → 2041.22] They now have a new service for their chairs
[2041.22 → 2043.22] Now, instead of just having...
[2043.22 → 2044.22] See you spoiled it, you suck
[2045.22 → 2047.22] Instead of just having a Taxonomic logo embroidered
[2048.22 → 2049.22] You can now have
[2050.22 → 2051.22] Bam!
[2051.22 → 2052.22] Your name!
[2052.22 → 2054.22] Which would have come in handy a lot of times around here
[2054.22 → 2055.22] Yes
[2055.22 → 2057.22] For all the times that people have taken
[2057.22 → 2058.22] My chair
[2058.22 → 2059.22] I actually have a label on it
[2059.22 → 2061.22] It says, Linus Chair Do Not Steal
[2061.22 → 2063.22] Didn't it happen today with this one?
[2063.22 → 2064.22] Even though it's embroidered?
[2064.22 → 2065.22] Yes
[2065.22 → 2066.22] Yes, it did
[2066.22 → 2067.22] So maybe it's not the solution
[2067.22 → 2068.22] It's easier to track down though
[2068.22 → 2071.22] Maybe it's not the solution to that particular problem
[2071.22 → 2073.22] So people being jackasses
[2073.22 → 2075.22] Is not something that embroidery can solve
[2076.22 → 2077.22] But at least you can have
[2078.22 → 2081.22] Like a BA multicoloured embroidery thing on your chair
[2081.22 → 2082.22] It's freaking cool
[2083.22 → 2085.22] They've got tons of different chairs
[2085.22 → 2086.22] Something for everyone
[2086.22 → 2088.22] And they've got a preview tool that allows you to see
[2088.22 → 2091.22] What it's going to look like on the chair
[2091.22 → 2093.22] They've got outstanding customer service
[2093.22 → 2096.22] And I can speak for the quality of the products
[2097.22 → 2099.22] I've been using mine for over two years now
[2100.22 → 2101.22] Me too
[2101.22 → 2102.22] Since I did my first review
[2102.22 → 2103.22] Mine's a Taxonomic too
[2103.22 → 2105.22] And other than my cheap Costco jeans
[2105.22 → 2107.22] Staining the seat blue a little bit
[2108.22 → 2109.22] It looks like the day I got it
[2109.22 → 2110.22] Yeah
[2110.22 → 2111.22] I love my chair
[2111.22 → 2112.22] Yeah
[2112.22 → 2113.22] So head over to need4seat.com
[2113.22 → 2116.22] And check out their new embroidery service today
[2116.22 → 2118.22] Leading us to our last sponsor
[2118.22 → 2121.22] Which apparently I've seen multiple people in the chat
[2121.22 → 2123.22] Actually asking for this one to be on the show
[2123.22 → 2125.22] Because I think it's entertaining when we eat hot things
[2125.22 → 2127.22] Alright, I think it's my turn
[2127.22 → 2128.22] It's your turn
[2129.22 → 2130.22] I hate you
[2132.22 → 2134.22] I'm eating something delicious that first
[2134.22 → 2135.22] Okay, that's fair
[2135.22 → 2136.22] Now I'm getting to it
[2136.22 → 2137.22] That's fair
[2137.22 → 2139.22] Savage jerky is made with the best ingredients
[2139.22 → 2142.22] Without nitrates or preservatives
[2143.22 → 2144.22] The goal was to create a snack
[2145.22 → 2146.22] That was full of flavour and spice
[2147.22 → 2148.22] But wasn't bad for you
[2149.22 → 2152.22] The inspiration comes from the flavour of garlic, lime and cilantro
[2153.22 → 2155.22] Because it brings out the flavour in premium beef
[2156.22 → 2158.22] Mmm, my personal favourite
[2159.22 → 2160.22] Is the maple buffalo bacon
[2160.22 → 2161.22] Which I think we're out of
[2161.22 → 2162.22] Because I just eat the entire pack
[2162.22 → 2163.22] Every time we do a spot
[2164.22 → 2165.22] Yeah
[2165.22 → 2166.22] But if you're into spicy
[2167.22 → 2168.22] Man, do they ever have a lot of options
[2168.22 → 2169.22] A lot of options
[2169.22 → 2170.22] What are you going to hit me with this week?
[2171.22 → 2172.22] Umm
[2173.22 → 2174.22] Fushih
[2174.22 → 2175.22] You had me try
[2176.22 → 2177.22] Man, this one's good
[2177.22 → 2178.22] I love the cracked pepper
[2178.22 → 2179.22] The cracked pepper and sea salt
[2179.22 → 2181.22] Honestly, I thought it was pretty good at first
[2181.22 → 2183.22] Now I actually like this one
[2183.22 → 2184.22] Almost as much as a maple
[2184.22 → 2185.22] Interesting
[2185.22 → 2187.22] Yeah, so I'm putting it over on this side
[2187.22 → 2188.22] So you had me try
[2188.22 → 2189.22] Oh, ghost pepper
[2189.22 → 2190.22] The ghost pepper
[2190.22 → 2192.22] Because you thought it was hotter than the reaper
[2193.22 → 2194.22] So I'm actually going to
[2194.22 → 2195.22] And I tried it, and it wasn't that bad
[2195.22 → 2196.22] So I'm going to leave it up to you
[2196.22 → 2200.22] You can go with the one that is listed as hotter
[2200.22 → 2201.22] And I think is hotter
[2201.22 → 2204.22] Or you can go with the one that is not listed as hotter
[2204.22 → 2205.22] Tell you what
[2205.22 → 2206.22] And you think is hotter
[2206.22 → 2207.22] Here's what I'm going to do
[2207.22 → 2208.22] I'm going to do both
[2208.22 → 2209.22] Okay
[2209.22 → 2210.22] I'm going to settle this once and for all
[2210.22 → 2211.22] See, I was thinking about that
[2211.22 → 2213.22] But I didn't want to put that on you
[2213.22 → 2214.22] No, no, no, no, no
[2214.22 → 2215.22] I saw where you were going
[2215.22 → 2216.22] Yeah
[2216.22 → 2218.22] No, no, don't think that just because you beat around the bus
[2218.22 → 2220.22] That you didn't throw me under it
[2220.22 → 2221.22] All right
[2221.22 → 2225.22] Because you were setting them up
[2225.22 → 2226.22] You were setting up their expectations
[2226.22 → 2227.22] A little bit
[2227.22 → 2228.22] Yeah
[2228.22 → 2229.22] A little bit
[2229.22 → 2230.22] Okay
[2230.22 → 2231.22] There might have been some minor social engineering going on
[2231.22 → 2232.22] So there's the ghost pepper
[2232.22 → 2235.22] That's a solid piece of jerky right there
[2235.22 → 2236.22] That's a good-looking piece of jerky
[2236.22 → 2238.22] That's a terrifying looking piece of jerky
[2238.22 → 2239.22] Yes
[2239.22 → 2240.22] It probably should be
[2240.22 → 2241.22] So use offer code LTT
[2241.22 → 2243.22] And save 10%
[2243.22 → 2247.22] At www.savagejerky.com
[2247.22 → 2248.22] Okay
[2248.22 → 2251.22] Did we send them a message about the challenge pack thing?
[2251.22 → 2253.22] I don't think we remembered
[2253.22 → 2254.22] We should
[2254.22 → 2255.22] Okay, so you go ahead
[2255.22 → 2257.22] You do our next topic here
[2257.22 → 2259.22] And I'm going to do the
[2259.22 → 2264.22] Sorry, I've got some of the other ones stuck in my tooth
[2264.22 → 2268.22] Got it, okay
[2268.22 → 2269.22] I don't want to taint it
[2269.22 → 2270.22] I don't want to taint it
[2270.22 → 2276.22] So I'm going to do a bite of ghost pepper buffalo sauce first
[2276.22 → 2278.22] Just to get my taste buds going
[2278.22 → 2280.22] Then I'm going to do one of each
[2280.22 → 2281.22] Okay?
[2285.22 → 2286.22] You go ahead and move on to our next topic
[2286.22 → 2288.22] I also ate a really spicy one apparently
[2290.22 → 2292.22] Wearables are tanking
[2292.22 → 2294.22] Jawbone is liquidating its assets
[2294.22 → 2296.22] We've kind of seen this coming for a while
[2296.22 → 2298.22] Even from your own personal experience
[2298.22 → 2300.22] How often is your smartwatch paired with your phone?
[2302.22 → 2303.22] Just out of an interesting question
[2303.22 → 2305.22] You overheard me talking about this, didn't you?
[2305.22 → 2306.22] I did, yeah
[2306.22 → 2307.22] But I'm like not even remotely
[2307.22 → 2309.22] The answer is like almost never, right?
[2310.22 → 2312.22] Well, I wouldn't say almost never
[2313.22 → 2314.22] How long has it been?
[2314.22 → 2316.22] Here, let me fire up the Engadget source for this one
[2316.22 → 2318.22] I can throw that in the chat
[2318.22 → 2319.22] That's okay, I got it
[2319.22 → 2322.22] Jawbone's demise heralds the end of the wearables' industry
[2322.22 → 2323.22] I think that's a little sensationalist
[2323.22 → 2324.22] I don't think that's necessarily
[2324.22 → 2325.22] A little rough
[2325.22 → 2326.22] A little rough?
[2326.22 → 2327.22] Yeah
[2327.22 → 2328.22] I think there's still space for
[2328.22 → 2330.22] I think you overheard me talking to Colton
[2330.22 → 2331.22] Yeah
[2331.22 → 2332.22] Because he asked me
[2333.22 → 2334.22] Whew
[2334.22 → 2336.22] Okay, I wasn't expecting to have to talk for this spot
[2337.22 → 2344.22] He asked me if I would be comfortable doing a product placement for a non-smart watch
[2344.22 → 2346.22] Where I'm just wearing it
[2346.22 → 2347.22] Okay
[2347.22 → 2348.22] Yeah, yeah, yeah
[2348.22 → 2349.22] And I was like
[2349.22 → 2351.22] He's like yeah, I know you love the smartwatch
[2351.22 → 2352.22] And I'm like
[2352.22 → 2354.22] Yeah, so let me put it this way
[2355.22 → 2357.22] For over two weeks
[2357.22 → 2359.22] I was wearing an Apple Watch
[2359.22 → 2362.22] That was paired to my iPhone 6
[2362.22 → 2364.22] The one that I only use
[2364.22 → 2366.22] To listen to music
[2366.22 → 2367.22] And watch videos in bed
[2367.22 → 2370.22] So when I was actually out and about during the day
[2370.22 → 2373.22] Like I obviously wasn't getting call notifications or text notifications
[2373.22 → 2375.22] Because it doesn't have a SIM in it
[2375.22 → 2376.22] And it would only like
[2376.22 → 2378.22] I'd randomly get like a bunch of notifications when I got home
[2378.22 → 2381.22] Like it clearly was not the optimal experience
[2381.22 → 2383.22] And it just wasn't even worth the five minutes
[2383.22 → 2386.22] Like I like the smartwatch experience
[2386.22 → 2388.22] I just switch phones so often
[2388.22 → 2390.22] That I just
[2390.22 → 2391.22] But it's not that important to you
[2391.22 → 2392.22] I just don't bother, yes
[2392.22 → 2394.22] And like as a consumer
[2394.22 → 2395.22] Yes
[2395.22 → 2396.22] Buying these
[2396.22 → 2399.22] I would buy, and I would own one
[2399.22 → 2401.22] But if I had an Apple Watch
[2401.22 → 2403.22] I wouldn't run out and buy the Gen 2
[2403.22 → 2404.22] So my experience was
[2404.22 → 2406.22] Because I tried out the Sony smartwatch 3
[2406.22 → 2407.22] I believe it was
[2407.22 → 2409.22] And I think I made a video on that quite a while ago
[2409.22 → 2410.22] Okay, I'm doing the other one
[2410.22 → 2411.22] Okay
[2411.22 → 2412.22] Go ahead
[2412.22 → 2414.22] So you just survived the ghost pepper, right?
[2414.22 → 2415.22] Which you thought was hotter
[2415.22 → 2416.22] Mm-hmm
[2416.22 → 2417.22] Okay
[2417.22 → 2418.22] So I tried the Sony smartwatch 3
[2418.22 → 2419.22] I believe it was
[2419.22 → 2420.22] Quite a while ago
[2420.22 → 2421.22] Made a video on it
[2421.22 → 2422.22] And it was perfect for the jazz
[2422.22 → 2423.22] My issue with that was
[2423.22 → 2425.22] We had a little thing where like
[2425.22 → 2427.22] If you're reviewing a type of product
[2427.22 → 2428.22] You should probably use it
[2428.22 → 2430.22] So I held on to that one for a little while
[2430.22 → 2431.22] It's now back
[2431.22 → 2434.22] But I found myself
[2434.22 → 2436.22] The need to charge it all the time
[2436.22 → 2438.22] And the fact that the charging port was under it
[2438.22 → 2440.22] And under a silicone thing
[2440.22 → 2442.22] So I couldn't just like dock
[2442.22 → 2443.22] Take it off and like drop it on a dock
[2443.22 → 2445.22] I had to take it off and like
[2445.22 → 2446.22] Get under there
[2446.22 → 2449.22] And probably take it out of its actual band
[2449.22 → 2451.22] And then remove the silicone thing
[2451.22 → 2452.22] And plug in the little cable
[2452.22 → 2453.22] Like
[2453.22 → 2455.22] It was just not a very usable experience
[2455.22 → 2458.22] And it got to the point where I would rather take it off
[2458.22 → 2459.22] And leave it
[2459.22 → 2461.22] Yeah, see that one is hotter
[2461.22 → 2462.22] Oh
[2462.22 → 2463.22] Okay
[2463.22 → 2465.22] See that one's definitely hotter
[2465.22 → 2466.22] Hold on, give me a sec
[2466.22 → 2468.22] Just let me let the palette cleanse a little bit
[2468.22 → 2469.22] Okay
[2469.22 → 2470.22] Alright
[2470.22 → 2471.22] So I still think
[2471.22 → 2472.22] It's just, it's tedious
[2472.22 → 2473.22] And the thing is like that's
[2473.22 → 2474.22] That's
[2474.22 → 2476.22] To make that experience better
[2476.22 → 2477.22] Requires buying a new watch
[2477.22 → 2478.22] And then now
[2478.22 → 2480.22] Now I'm buying another watch
[2480.22 → 2482.22] And I wasn't really that satisfied with that one
[2482.22 → 2484.22] And now it's the current level of watch
[2484.22 → 2486.22] And I still don't think it's that great
[2486.22 → 2487.22] I think we might get there eventually
[2487.22 → 2489.22] But I think we're a few years early
[2489.22 → 2490.22] So that's exactly it
[2490.22 → 2492.22] I think demise of wearables
[2492.22 → 2493.22] Is a little ridiculous
[2494.22 → 2496.22] I just think that wearables aren't going to be
[2496.22 → 2497.22] The slam dunk
[2497.22 → 2498.22] Like
[2498.22 → 2499.22] Like
[2499.22 → 2500.22] Next smartphone
[2500.22 → 2501.22] Like companies like
[2502.22 → 2503.22] Samsung
[2503.22 → 2504.22] Or maybe even Apple
[2504.22 → 2505.22] Were expecting them to be
[2506.22 → 2507.22] Because
[2507.22 → 2508.22] The experience right now
[2508.22 → 2509.22] Just isn't worth
[2510.22 → 2512.22] Five or six or eight hundred dollars
[2512.22 → 2513.22] Like a premium watch
[2514.22 → 2515.22] People feel like it is
[2515.22 → 2517.22] Because it's a piece of jewellery
[2518.22 → 2519.22] Whereas I do think
[2519.22 → 2521.22] That there are wearables out there
[2521.22 → 2522.22] That are more reasonably priced
[2523.22 → 2524.22] Yeah
[2524.22 → 2525.22] That can make sense
[2525.22 → 2526.22] And I also think
[2526.22 → 2527.22] That development will continue
[2527.22 → 2529.22] And we will get to the point where
[2530.22 → 2531.22] The charging thing is a great point
[2532.22 → 2533.22] Like if I
[2533.22 → 2534.22] Misalign my watch
[2534.22 → 2535.22] And it doesn't charge that night
[2535.22 → 2536.22] Yeah
[2536.22 → 2537.22] It doesn't work the next day
[2537.22 → 2538.22] That's a pain in the butt
[2538.22 → 2539.22] Whereas
[2539.22 → 2540.22] When wireless charging gets to the point
[2540.22 → 2541.22] Where you just kind of throw all your junk
[2541.22 → 2542.22] Drop it in a bowl
[2542.22 → 2543.22] In a bowl
[2543.22 → 2544.22] In a bowl at the end of the day
[2544.22 → 2545.22] Yeah
[2545.22 → 2546.22] Then that's cool
[2546.22 → 2547.22] That's way way better of experience
[2547.22 → 2548.22] So we'll get there
[2548.22 → 2549.22] It needs to be a lot easier
[2550.22 → 2552.22] Right now I feel like it's kind of a barrier
[2552.22 → 2553.22] Between using things
[2553.22 → 2555.22] But charging it is tedious
[2555.22 → 2557.22] Making sure it's paired with all your stuff
[2557.22 → 2558.22] And linked into all your apps
[2558.22 → 2559.22] Right now is tedious
[2559.22 → 2560.22] It's not a seamless experience
[2560.22 → 2561.22] Through your phone
[2561.22 → 2563.22] Like there's just too many steps
[2563.22 → 2565.22] That you have to constantly redo
[2566.22 → 2567.22] So
[2567.22 → 2568.22] To cover the news here
[2568.22 → 2570.22] This is just the latest
[2570.22 → 2571.22] Wearable pioneer
[2571.22 → 2572.22] To throw in the towel
[2572.22 → 2573.22] Last year
[2573.22 → 2575.22] Last year Pebble sold its assets to Fitbit
[2575.22 → 2576.22] In a fire sale
[2577.22 → 2578.22] As for Fitbit
[2578.22 → 2580.22] They're trading at a 52-week low
[2580.22 → 2582.22] So Jawbone was actually last valued
[2583.22 → 2585.22] At $1.5 billion
[2585.22 → 2587.22] When they raised $165 million
[2587.22 → 2589.22] In January 2016
[2590.22 → 2592.22] Despite shuttering their business
[2592.22 → 2593.22] They still think they're worth
[2593.22 → 2594.22] A significant amount of money
[2594.22 → 2596.22] Due to pending litigation with Fitbit
[2596.22 → 2598.22] But the company has begun the process
[2598.22 → 2599.22] Of liquidating itself
[2599.22 → 2600.22] At least in part
[2600.22 → 2602.22] I also think that there's probably
[2602.22 → 2604.22] Too many wearable brands
[2604.22 → 2605.22] So I'm not that surprised
[2605.22 → 2606.22] I'm a little surprised
[2606.22 → 2607.22] That it's happening to Jawbone
[2607.22 → 2608.22] Because they've been around for a long time
[2608.22 → 2610.22] And that most of them are just kind of junk
[2610.22 → 2611.22] From my experience
[2611.22 → 2612.22] Yeah
[2612.22 → 2613.22] I mean you were going to do
[2613.22 → 2614.22] Sorry?
[2614.22 → 2615.22] Apple Watch
[2615.22 → 2616.22] Oh get out of here
[2616.22 → 2617.22] Yeah the Apple Watch
[2617.22 → 2618.22] Blah blah blah
[2618.22 → 2619.22] Like you were going to do a round up
[2619.22 → 2620.22] Of fitness wearables
[2620.22 → 2621.22] Yeah
[2621.22 → 2622.22] Because they're all
[2622.22 → 2623.22] We actually ran out and bought like six of them
[2623.22 → 2624.22] Super Jacky
[2624.22 → 2625.22] Yeah
[2625.22 → 2626.22] But like
[2626.22 → 2627.22] It never happened because
[2627.22 → 2629.22] Well okay
[2629.22 → 2630.22] Are we
[2630.22 → 2631.22] The real reason why it didn't happen
[2631.22 → 2632.22] Yeah come on
[2632.22 → 2633.22] Go
[2633.22 → 2634.22] It just took way too freaking long
[2634.22 → 2636.22] Okay so we wanted to pair with
[2636.22 → 2639.22] Educational institution
[2639.22 → 2640.22] X
[2640.22 → 2641.22] Yeah local university
[2641.22 → 2642.22] Yeah we wanted to pair with a local university
[2642.22 → 2645.22] Because they have a really cool on site medical thing
[2645.22 → 2650.22] Where they can like to use proper equipment to properly test exactly what's going on with your heart
[2650.22 → 2665.22] And we didn't want to do it with like just some fitness band because I wanted absolutely as accurate as I could get because I wanted this to be an actual thing that people could point at when debating the viability of fitness watches
[2665.22 → 2666.22] Yeah
[2666.22 → 2679.22] And they were interested, but they wanted to launch these videos along with something that they were working on, and then it took them like they said it was going to take a few months end up taking them like six months I still started contacting them, and they were like
[2679.22 → 2685.22] Okay well we're not really launching this thing in the same way as before we can still work with you on it but
[2685.22 → 2686.22] How much are you willing to pay us?
[2686.22 → 2687.22] How much are you willing to pay us?
[2687.22 → 2689.22] How much are you willing to pay us to use the facility?
[2689.22 → 2691.22] How much are you willing to pay us to use the consumables?
[2691.22 → 2695.22] How much are you willing to pay us for our time per person that has to be there?
[2695.22 → 2697.22] Here's all the people that have to be there
[2697.22 → 2699.22] Basically it wasn't a partnership anymore
[2699.22 → 2714.22] Yeah they were looking for like a many thousands of dollars paycheck to run this testing that was only existing for the sake of for the like we weren't going to be making that kind of money on it like we were going to make like a couple of hundred bucks on AdSense
[2714.22 → 2718.22] And we invested a lot in buying all the watches part of the idea of the video was actually
[2718.22 → 2727.22] And we were investing in a video crew and editing and like all that stuff that like we bring to the table, and it was going to be exposure for their program like they were just they were not being partners about it at all
[2727.22 → 2751.22] And it was supposed to be a like actually a pro health video which is why we wanted to work with a health focused Institute because it was supposed to address the idea of people over exercising, and I know that sounds kind of weird because that's not usually the problem that exists but the problem that they were trying to address was rather old people
[2751.22 → 2764.22] Right 80s 90s year old people that were trying to stay fit and that's awesome but going too hard at it and stressing out their hearts like going for extended very extended bike rides every single day
[2764.22 → 2771.22] Right, and it was just too stressful on their hearts, but they were looking at these smartwatches and going oh I'm still within the training zone
[2771.22 → 2778.22] Right but that doesn't even if that is accurate which it's not probably really know if I'm going to say that it is
[2778.22 → 2786.22] It still doesn't account for a lot of other things that can be going on with your heart that can be terrible
[2786.22 → 2791.22] Even if you're in the training zone there can be other things going on, but I know you've done a lot of research in terms of heart stuff
[2791.22 → 2798.22] Yes, yeah, but people trust this thing, and they go oh it's saying that I'm doing well therefore everything is going well
[2798.22 → 2803.22] But the hearts not as complicated as just as fast as it's going, so people trust this
[2803.22 → 2810.22] Or rather it's more complicated. Yeah, yeah, and the Fitbit's congratulating them and giving them gamified feedback about how well they're doing
[2810.22 → 2814.22] When their heart can't take this much stress because they're old, and it can't
[2814.22 → 2822.22] So we were trying to help address that also point at like amount of steps that's happening and point at how stupid that is
[2822.22 → 2830.22] And we had a really cool shot where we were in a bus in Mexico and my step counter was just going like mad because there was all these bumps
[2830.22 → 2831.22] Right
[2831.22 → 2836.22] So that we were gonna address how inaccurate these things are, but it just never ended up working out
[2836.22 → 2837.22] Okay, I have the answer
[2838.22 → 2843.22] So the Reaper is hotter on the tail end
[2843.22 → 2844.22] Okay
[2844.22 → 2849.22] So it leaves a more extended burn
[2849.22 → 2850.22] Yeah, okay
[2850.22 → 2853.22] Whereas the ghost pepper probably has a hotter initial burst
[2853.22 → 2854.22] A little bit of a punch
[2854.22 → 2855.22] Interesting
[2855.22 → 2859.22] But what I'll say is that this is the most of either of them that I've been able to eat in one sitting
[2859.22 → 2860.22] And like
[2860.22 → 2861.22] We're gaining tolerance
[2861.22 → 2862.22] Yeah, like I've always
[2862.22 → 2863.22] Over these Wackos
[2863.22 → 2865.22] Like I've always said in the past they're delicious
[2865.22 → 2866.22] Yeah
[2866.22 → 2867.22] But I can only handle like a bite
[2867.22 → 2868.22] Yeah
[2868.22 → 2872.22] Oh wow
[2872.22 → 2878.22] Oh that's like a full-size piece and a half now if you total it all together right?
[2878.22 → 2879.22] I'm feeling good
[2879.22 → 2880.22] That's crazy
[2880.22 → 2881.22] These are fricking delicious
[2881.22 → 2882.22] They are
[2882.22 → 2883.22] They're even better once you're used to it
[2883.22 → 2886.22] We're off the sponsor spot just in case people are wondering
[2886.22 → 2887.22] But like
[2887.22 → 2888.22] Yeah
[2888.22 → 2889.22] Man that's yummy
[2889.22 → 2890.22] So they should okay
[2890.22 → 2892.22] They should offer two different things now
[2892.22 → 2895.22] And we should like actually contact them about this
[2895.22 → 2896.22] There should be the challenge pack
[2896.22 → 2898.22] And the tolerance pack
[2898.22 → 2899.22] And the tolerance pack
[2899.22 → 2900.22] And the tolerance
[2900.22 → 2902.22] The tolerance subscription maybe
[2903.22 → 2905.22] Where like it sends you
[2905.22 → 2907.22] You pick where your start is on the line
[2907.22 → 2908.22] Yeah
[2908.22 → 2909.22] And then it'll send you them
[2909.22 → 2912.22] Like the same kind for like a month
[2912.22 → 2913.22] And then you get upgraded
[2913.22 → 2915.22] Up one heat tier
[2915.22 → 2916.22] And then it sends you the same kind for like a month
[2916.22 → 2917.22] And then you get upgraded
[2917.22 → 2918.22] And you have to try to like
[2918.22 → 2919.22] I like it
[2919.22 → 2920.22] Yeah
[2920.22 → 2921.22] Alright
[2921.22 → 2922.22] So
[2922.22 → 2924.22] The original article here
[2924.22 → 2926.22] Is from TechCrunch
[2927.22 → 2929.22] And it's finally happened
[2929.22 → 2930.22] Yep
[2930.22 → 2934.22] Pornhub has built in support for interactive toys
[2935.22 → 2937.22] Huh
[2937.22 → 2939.22] This is a great meme right here
[2939.22 → 2940.22] This image is not related to the text
[2940.22 → 2941.22] Because
[2941.22 → 2943.22] I don't think TechCrunch is edgy enough
[2943.22 → 2946.22] To put in an image that is related to the text here
[2946.22 → 2947.22] Maybe not share that one
[2948.22 → 2950.22] Source 2 was a little bit more lewd
[2950.22 → 2953.22] Oh man my stomach is still working on it
[2953.22 → 2954.22] But okay
[2954.22 → 2955.22] If someone
[2955.22 → 2956.22] No one's going to do this
[2956.22 → 2958.22] But if someone went back to like the first time
[2958.22 → 2959.22] That we had a Savage Jerky sponsorship
[2959.22 → 2960.22] Oh yeah it just about killed me
[2960.22 → 2961.22] Me too
[2961.22 → 2962.22] Yeah
[2962.22 → 2964.22] It's happening we're getting better
[2964.22 → 2966.22] So Canada's porn mega site Pornhub
[2966.22 → 2971.22] Has launched a new series of videos that sync with the users interactive sex toy
[2971.22 → 2975.22] To make it a more intimate experience both visually and physically
[2975.22 → 2979.22] And something that I referenced a little while ago on a WAN show that you weren't here for
[2979.22 → 2980.22] Yeah
[2980.22 → 2983.22] Was that I'm still subscribed to like the Oculus Subreddit and stuff like that
[2983.22 → 2984.22] And I've seen a
[2985.22 → 2990.22] The percentage of time that a post hits the front page that is about not safe for work topics
[2990.22 → 2992.22] Seems to be
[2992.22 → 2997.22] I don't know if this is 100% accurate, but it seems to be to my perceptions without diving too far into it
[2997.22 → 2999.22] Increasing over time
[2999.22 → 3002.22] As interest in VR decreases
[3002.22 → 3004.22] Because the people that are still
[3004.22 → 3006.22] Are still interested in it
[3006.22 → 3008.22] A lot of them are using it for not safe for work stuff
[3008.22 → 3012.22] And Pornhub is saying that their VR category is doing very well
[3012.22 → 3014.22] And I'm actually not that surprised
[3014.22 → 3017.22] A million plus views per day
[3017.22 → 3018.22] Yep
[3018.22 → 3021.22] I didn't even think there were that many VR headsets out there
[3021.22 → 3022.22] I mean
[3022.22 → 3024.22] Sometimes it might take more than one video
[3026.22 → 3027.22] Who knows?
[3030.22 → 3031.22] Fair enough
[3031.22 → 3032.22] And I guess it's all in how you define a view
[3032.22 → 3033.22] Yes
[3033.22 → 3034.22] Like if you're just like
[3034.22 → 3036.22] Okay, yeah, skip the first bit
[3036.22 → 3037.22] Oh, it's alright
[3037.22 → 3039.22] Yeah, skip to the end
[3039.22 → 3040.22] Okay, here we go
[3040.22 → 3041.22] Yeah
[3041.22 → 3042.22] Is that a view?
[3042.22 → 3043.22] I don't know
[3043.22 → 3044.22] In important terms, I think so
[3044.22 → 3045.22] Yeah
[3045.22 → 3046.22] Yeah
[3046.22 → 3047.22] Alright
[3047.22 → 3050.22] So yeah, I think that's pretty much it
[3050.22 → 3052.22] The Samsung one's not really that interesting
[3052.22 → 3053.22] Okay
[3053.22 → 3055.22] Eh, hackers do a thing
[3055.22 → 3057.22] Oh, this is ridiculous
[3057.22 → 3059.22] Original article here from Ars Technica
[3059.22 → 3061.22] Posted by WMGroomAK
[3063.22 → 3066.22] OneDrive has stopped working on non-NTFS drives
[3067.22 → 3069.22] Fat disks are no longer supported
[3069.22 → 3073.22] And more surprisingly, neither is the new REFS file system
[3073.22 → 3074.22] Oh, whoa
[3074.22 → 3075.22] Oh, okay
[3075.22 → 3077.22] Now just to be clear, it can still get you
[3077.22 → 3079.22] I had a little bit there go down the wrong pipe
[3079.22 → 3080.22] Oh, okay, that's particularly weird
[3080.22 → 3081.22] Ouch
[3081.22 → 3083.22] But basically
[3083.22 → 3084.22] Okay, why don't you do this one?
[3084.22 → 3085.22] The OneDrive thing?
[3085.22 → 3100.22] Okay, yeah, so to continue to use the software files will need to be stored on an NTFS volume
[3100.22 → 3103.22] You saw the error that was on Linus's screen
[3103.22 → 3105.22] I'm going to bring it back up
[3105.22 → 3106.22] There you go
[3106.22 → 3108.22] So it will warn you
[3108.22 → 3112.22] So that it must be formatted with NTFS file system
[3112.22 → 3116.22] Now the thing that sucks about that you are going to have to move all of that stuff off
[3116.22 → 3118.22] Format your drive and move it back
[3118.22 → 3119.22] Which is like
[3119.22 → 3121.22] Super lame
[3121.22 → 3123.22] Yeah, if you're buying storage space
[3123.22 → 3124.22] Yeah
[3124.22 → 3128.22] That's like safe so you don't have to have it duplicated
[3128.22 → 3129.22] Because that's the thing
[3129.22 → 3139.22] With the like scaled storage infrastructure thing where you have it in like three different locations and two different formats and blah blah blah blah
[3139.22 → 3145.22] You would have to retain that while moving things off of the NTFS systems onto
[3145.22 → 3146.22] Wait, no
[3146.22 → 3149.22] Off of the whatever other systems onto NTFS systems
[3149.22 → 3154.22] And what you're probably going to be doing is wanting to keep your current infrastructure and just format it
[3154.22 → 3157.22] So you'd be moving it off to something they're going to have to trust
[3157.22 → 3163.22] Very likely in the cloud whether it's AWS or something else because you don't want to permanently buy all these drives
[3163.22 → 3164.22] And then moving all of it back
[3164.22 → 3166.22] Which is not just tedious, but it's expensive
[3166.22 → 3168.22] Which is super freaking annoying
[3168.22 → 3169.22] I'm going to move us off
[3169.22 → 3170.22] Oh, we're already off
[3170.22 → 3173.22] So you guys don't have to look at that ad that's now on Linus's screen
[3173.22 → 3177.22] Looking back at it NTFS is the default system for Windows
[3177.22 → 3184.22] But people using SD cards to extend the storage on small laptops and tablets and Nuns
[3184.22 → 3185.22] That's a big thing right now
[3185.22 → 3190.22] So a lot of people that have business computers that they mount on the back of monitors
[3190.22 → 3192.22] Those are commonly Nuns these days
[3192.22 → 3195.22] I know a while ago they were all the Total
[3195.22 → 3197.22] Can't remember the name of it right now
[3197.22 → 3198.22] But Total Z-Box
[3198.22 → 3199.22] Yeah, Z-Box
[3199.22 → 3200.22] Yeah, Z-Box
[3200.22 → 3201.22] But they're commonly Nuns these days
[3201.22 → 3204.22] And a lot of people expand the storage on Nuns with SD cards so
[3204.22 → 3207.22] Yeah, basically it's terrible
[3207.22 → 3210.22] And it's yet another reason not to use OneDrive because Google Drive works
[3210.22 → 3217.22] And people often using storage spaces to manage large redundant storage volumes will often use REFS
[3217.22 → 3220.22] Storage spaces is like their own thing
[3220.22 → 3221.22] Yeah
[3221.22 → 3222.22] Yeah
[3222.22 → 3223.22] Ugh
[3223.22 → 3224.22] In other news
[3224.22 → 3228.22] This was posted by Jamie's Cone on the forum
[3228.22 → 3229.22] Red
[3229.22 → 3231.22] Announces a phone
[3231.22 → 3233.22] One quick thing before we go there
[3233.22 → 3234.22] Yeah
[3234.22 → 3238.22] Apparently the company's position is that OneDrive should always have warned about these usage scenarios
[3238.22 → 3242.22] And that it's only a bug or an oversight that it was allowed
[3242.22 → 3247.22] That it was allowed to be used on non-NTFS volumes at all
[3247.22 → 3249.22] Which is just bogus
[3249.22 → 3251.22] But anyway, yes, Red announced a phone
[3251.22 → 3253.22] Linus is going, oh he's going for the sea salt
[3253.22 → 3254.22] That makes a lot of sense
[3254.22 → 3255.22] Yeah
[3255.22 → 3257.22] Red is announcing a phone
[3257.22 → 3260.22] It's a very, very expensive phone
[3260.22 → 3264.22] Costing roughly, these are subject to change
[3264.22 → 3268.22] Either $1595 for the titanium version
[3268.22 → 3272.22] Or $1,195 for the aluminum version
[3272.22 → 3273.22] Which is just nuts
[3273.22 → 3276.22] It's a 5.7 inch holographic display
[3276.22 → 3278.22] It runs Android
[3278.22 → 3282.22] The handset screen can seamlessly switch between traditional 2D content and home
[3282.22 → 3285.22] 2D content and holographic 3D content such as games
[3285.22 → 3288.22] It will support Hydrogen 4 view content
[3288.22 → 3290.22] A file type that Red has produced
[3290.22 → 3293.22] And content will be stored via
[3293.22 → 3295.22] That content will be stored via the Red channel
[3295.22 → 3299.22] Which allows users to stream holographic games and movies
[3299.22 → 3301.22] That is nuts
[3301.22 → 3304.22] Red is saying that it may struggle to fill orders
[3304.22 → 3306.22] Very unsurprisingly
[3306.22 → 3308.22] Due to the display production limitations
[3308.22 → 3312.22] Of making like this holographic display and stuff
[3312.22 → 3314.22] That can support Hydrogen 4 view content
[3314.22 → 3316.22] They're not telling us almost anything about specs
[3316.22 → 3317.22] Nope
[3317.22 → 3318.22] We can assume
[3318.22 → 3321.22] That the camera will be pretty cool
[3321.22 → 3323.22] Yeah, if you look at the picture
[3323.22 → 3324.22] Which you should be able to get
[3324.22 → 3325.22] Yeah
[3325.22 → 3326.22] By jumping in there
[3326.22 → 3327.22] I had it open here
[3327.22 → 3332.22] The camera is fairly prominently displayed up at the top there
[3332.22 → 3333.22] Yeah, and it doesn't look like as many
[3333.22 → 3335.22] Oh, it actually doesn't look reasonably thin
[3335.22 → 3337.22] I like the grip on the side
[3337.22 → 3338.22] If you compare to the size of the
[3338.22 → 3339.22] That's pretty cool
[3339.22 → 3340.22] Yes, I like the grip on the side too
[3340.22 → 3342.22] If you compare to the size of the headphone jack
[3342.22 → 3343.22] It doesn't look that thick
[3343.22 → 3344.22] Nope
[3344.22 → 3348.22] There's some type of docking port style thing
[3348.22 → 3351.22] On the bottom near where the Type-C is
[3351.22 → 3353.22] There's a huge red logo on what looks like
[3353.22 → 3355.22] That's their limo connector
[3355.22 → 3356.22] Yeah, okay
[3356.22 → 3358.22] So this right here looks like it's to attach it
[3358.22 → 3359.22] So that
[3359.22 → 3361.22] So they're not telling us a lot about specs
[3361.22 → 3362.22] Like in terms of processor
[3362.22 → 3364.22] Could it act as a display for your camera then?
[3364.22 → 3365.22] Yes
[3365.22 → 3366.22] Yeah, okay
[3366.22 → 3368.22] They're advertising that you can use it as a display for a red camera
[3368.22 → 3369.22] Okay
[3369.22 → 3372.22] So that's assuming you want to spend the $200 for the cable
[3372.22 → 3375.22] And the $200 for the bracket that sits on that dock
[3375.22 → 3377.22] Nice, yes, red
[3377.22 → 3378.22] There you go
[3378.22 → 3380.22] And the one for your camera
[3380.22 → 3381.22] So $600
[3381.22 → 3382.22] $600
[3382.22 → 3383.22] $600 each for those parts
[3383.22 → 3385.22] I actually have another
[3385.22 → 3387.22] You heard it here first folks
[3387.22 → 3390.22] I have another holy shit episode coming
[3390.22 → 3392.22] Featuring an overpriced red product
[3393.22 → 3394.22] Dude
[3394.22 → 3395.22] If you just
[3395.22 → 3396.22] You could get infinite holy shit videos
[3396.22 → 3398.22] Just buy every single thing that red has
[3398.22 → 3400.22] Oh yeah, I mean I don't even know if this phone is going to be a review
[3400.22 → 3401.22] I bought one by the way
[3401.22 → 3403.22] So I bought one
[3403.22 → 3404.22] Not because I plan to keep it
[3404.22 → 3405.22] I plan to flip it
[3405.22 → 3406.22] Oh yeah
[3406.22 → 3409.22] But I bought one so that we can do a video on it
[3409.22 → 3410.22] Cause
[3410.22 → 3411.22] Go back real quick
[3411.22 → 3412.22] Red doesn't sample for Jack
[3412.22 → 3413.22] One thing I wanted to point out is
[3413.22 → 3415.22] Like the phone's on kind of weird angle and stuff
[3415.22 → 3420.22] But you can kind of figure out how big that red digital cinema hydrogen logo thing is
[3420.22 → 3421.22] Yep
[3421.22 → 3424.22] And that looks like a relatively similar size to the camera
[3424.22 → 3425.22] That's up at the top
[3425.22 → 3427.22] So that camera is huge
[3427.22 → 3429.22] It's also a little hard to tell from the perspective
[3429.22 → 3432.22] But this looks lower profile than this heat sink here
[3432.22 → 3433.22] It looks like a raised heat sink
[3433.22 → 3434.22] Which looks below that
[3434.22 → 3435.22] Yeah
[3435.22 → 3436.22] Which also still has a camera bump
[3436.22 → 3437.22] Yeah
[3437.22 → 3438.22] So that camera might be like dope AF
[3438.22 → 3439.22] Pretty massive
[3439.22 → 3440.22] Which is cool actually
[3440.22 → 3441.22] That's really cool
[3441.22 → 3442.22] Cause as of right now
[3442.22 → 3444.22] I play one game on my phone
[3444.22 → 3445.22] I use it for messaging services
[3445.22 → 3446.22] Mainly email
[3446.22 → 3447.22] And I take photos
[3447.22 → 3448.22] And camera
[3448.22 → 3450.22] That's pretty much it
[3450.22 → 3452.22] Alright
[3452.22 → 3453.22] Um
[3453.22 → 3455.22] Blah blah blah
[3455.22 → 3456.22] Some boring legal battles
[3456.22 → 3457.22] Some other thing
[3457.22 → 3458.22] Some other thing
[3458.22 → 3460.22] And I think that's pretty much it for the WAN Show
[3460.22 → 3461.22] Hooray
[3461.22 → 3463.22] So thank you guys very much for tuning in
[3463.22 → 3464.22] And
[3464.22 → 3465.22] If you were wondering
[3465.22 → 3467.22] If you're not already signed up for Float plane
[3467.22 → 3469.22] What's on Float plane right now
[3469.22 → 3470.22] Yeah
[3470.22 → 3471.22] We're going to go through it
[3471.22 → 3472.22] Yes
[3472.22 → 3473.22] Very good
[3473.22 → 3475.22] Dying
[3475.22 → 3479.22] So on Float plane now is the mezzanine non-update
[3479.22 → 3481.22] The office is in shambles
[3481.22 → 3482.22] That was actually kind of interesting
[3482.22 → 3484.22] The permits have stalled
[3484.22 → 3487.22] Construction is not moving forward at the rate that we would have liked right now
[3487.22 → 3490.22] And everything around here is in such
[3490.22 → 3492.22] Horrendous condition
[3492.22 → 3495.22] That it is killing me
[3495.22 → 3497.22] It's a little bit of a behind the scenes look
[3497.22 → 3499.22] At what it's like to work
[3499.22 → 3501.22] Basically in a construction zone
[3501.22 → 3502.22] Yep
[3502.22 → 3503.22] Trying to film professional videos
[3503.22 → 3504.22] You know the funny thing is
[3504.22 → 3507.22] With like while increasing production quality
[3507.22 → 3510.22] The feedback on our videos lately has been great
[3510.22 → 3512.22] Speaking of which
[3512.22 → 3515.22] Where is that one video that I like a lot?
[3515.22 → 3516.22] There it is
[3516.22 → 3517.22] Okay so this video
[3517.22 → 3519.22] Turning Scrap Electronics into gold bars
[3519.22 → 3520.22] Is like
[3520.22 → 3523.22] Worth signing up for Float plane Club over
[3523.22 → 3524.22] It's freaking amazing
[3524.22 → 3529.22] It's one of my favourite videos of any kind from any creator that I've watched in a while
[3529.22 → 3531.22] And I had no idea that it was coming
[3531.22 → 3532.22] And I'm not just saying that
[3532.22 → 3535.22] Like if you wait till it comes on YouTube that's fine
[3535.22 → 3536.22] Watch if it's an amazing video
[3536.22 → 3538.22] But I would suggest checking it out on Float plane
[3538.22 → 3540.22] It'll look better anyway and sound better
[3540.22 → 3541.22] So there's that
[3541.22 → 3542.22] Yeah
[3542.22 → 3543.22] But it's an amazing video
[3543.22 → 3547.22] It doesn't feel necessarily 100% like a lot of the content that we make
[3547.22 → 3548.22] Yep
[3548.22 → 3553.22] It's much more like deep dive into something fascinating and informative
[3553.22 → 3554.22] It's a very professional piece
[3554.22 → 3555.22] I think it's super cool
[3555.22 → 3557.22] There are no dick jokes
[3557.22 → 3558.22] No
[3558.22 → 3559.22] Which is like weird
[3559.22 → 3564.22] We also reviewed what is hands down the best value gaming notebook we've ever checked out
[3564.22 → 3565.22] That's cool
[3565.22 → 3567.22] So this is the Predator Helios 300
[3567.22 → 3573.22] We've got our review of EK Water blocks' aluminum gaming products
[3573.22 → 3574.22] I say gaming products
[3574.22 → 3575.22] Water cooling products
[3575.22 → 3577.22] But of course you can water cool a gaming machine
[3577.22 → 3580.22] Tech quickies, phone tethering as fast as possible
[3580.22 → 3583.22] And why does your internet connection randomly stop working?
[3585.22 → 3586.22] This is a banging video
[3586.22 → 3587.22] Oh yeah
[3590.22 → 3592.22] The intro to this is fantastic
[3592.22 → 3596.22] The ultimate DIY arcade machine guide
[3596.22 → 3599.22] So that's the arcade machine that is behind us right now
[3599.22 → 3601.22] You should blow it up and play it
[3601.22 → 3603.22] Just the little intro bit
[3603.22 → 3604.22] I want to tease them
[3604.22 → 3605.22] Alright
[3605.22 → 3607.22] We checked out the main gear Omen X
[3607.22 → 3610.22] Like the most amazing looking gaming machine we have ever reviewed
[3610.22 → 3611.22] Yeah
[3611.22 → 3612.22] This thing is unbelievable
[3612.22 → 3613.22] Like
[3613.22 → 3614.22] Just the attention to detail
[3614.22 → 3617.22] You give main gear like basically on a limited budget
[3617.22 → 3619.22] And tell them to water cool things with hardline
[3619.22 → 3620.22] And it'll look amazing
[3620.22 → 3621.22] Yeah I know right
[3621.22 → 3624.22] We've got our Asus Zephyrus
[3624.22 → 3625.22] Review is up
[3625.22 → 3628.22] So that's the thinnest GTX 1080 gaming laptop
[3628.22 → 3631.22] Mezzanine update 8
[3631.22 → 3632.22] The fire department intervenes
[3632.22 → 3633.22] Oh boy
[3633.22 → 3634.22] Uh yeah
[3634.22 → 3637.22] Straight up not clickbait
[3637.22 → 3640.22] And then Deadmau5's studio tour actually just went up on YouTube
[3640.22 → 3641.22] So that's uh
[3641.22 → 3643.22] So that's everything that's up on Float plane right now
[3643.22 → 3645.22] But not yet
[3645.22 → 3646.22] Up on YouTube
[3646.22 → 3648.22] You know we've actually
[3648.22 → 3650.22] Even after Scrapyard Wars
[3650.22 → 3651.22] Interest in Float plane
[3651.22 → 3653.22] Like people seem to be feeling like it's a pretty good value
[3653.22 → 3654.22] Yeah
[3654.22 → 3657.22] We've lost some subs which we knew
[3657.22 → 3658.22] Yeah
[3658.22 → 3659.22] Because Scrapyard Wars hype
[3659.22 → 3663.22] But we're actually gaining new ones at the same rate
[3663.22 → 3665.22] That we're bleeding them already
[3665.22 → 3667.22] Which is pretty cool
[3667.22 → 3668.22] Which is actually really cool
[3668.22 → 3670.22] Um, so I'm just going to post that in Twitch chat
[3670.22 → 3672.22] Where you guys can go sign off if you want to
[3672.22 → 3674.22] And that's pretty much it
[3674.22 → 3675.22] Um
[3675.22 → 3676.22] Are you out of here right now?
[3676.22 → 3678.22] Or did you want to do a short uh Float plane progress stream?
[3678.22 → 3679.22] I can do that
[3679.22 → 3680.22] Yeah
[3680.22 → 3681.22] Sure why don't we do a short one
[3681.22 → 3682.22] Okay
[3682.22 → 3684.22] So uh intro blah blah blah
[3684.22 → 3685.22] Oh whoops
[3685.22 → 3686.22] There we go
[3687.22 → 3688.22] Huh
[3688.22 → 3689.22] I'm recovered now
[3692.22 → 3693.22] Yes what do you need from me?
[3693.22 → 3694.22] Thumbnail?
[3694.22 → 3696.22] Uh where do you want to shoot it?
[3698.22 → 3699.22] Okay
[3699.22 → 3700.22] Go ahead and fire it up
[3700.22 → 3701.22] We're going to do an after party stream
[3701.22 → 3703.22] But just a short one
[3703.22 → 3704.22] Um
[3704.22 → 3705.22] Um
[3705.22 → 3706.22] Yeah
[3706.22 → 3708.22] And I'll just run over there
