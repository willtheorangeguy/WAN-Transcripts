[0.00 → 7.84] Hello! Welcome to the WAN Show everybody! We've got a great show for you guys today.
[7.84 → 11.96] You seem hesitant. We don't have a great show for them? Is it a bad show?
[11.96 → 22.32] We have intense news. The Apple topic? Oh, I know, right? Yeah. So it turns out Apple is slowing down your old iPhone.
[22.32 → 27.00] Well, except for those of you who are like, haha, jokes on you, I don't have an iPhone.
[27.00 → 32.40] Except for you, Apple cannot slow down your iPhone, but they can slow down your friend's iPhone.
[32.40 → 35.40] So you should still care about this. We'll talk about it a little more later.
[35.40 → 41.44] Intel CEO Brian Kasich came out and said, we are going to take more risks.
[41.44 → 48.00] So basically, Intel is getting into the energy drink sector.
[48.00 → 51.00] Nice! Intel inside, get it?
[51.00 → 58.40] They're going to have a new slogan. Intel, we want to be inside you.
[58.40 → 59.40] Right now.
[59.40 → 61.40] Right now. Over and over.
[61.40 → 62.40] All night.
[62.40 → 64.40] All night? Oh, I love it!
[64.40 → 68.40] Oh, we are off to a good start today.
[68.40 → 69.40] This is great.
[69.40 → 75.80] I can't get into the doc, but there is other good news.
[75.80 → 78.80] Good news? Yeah, Facebook strikes a music deal with Universal.
[78.80 → 79.80] I guess that's good news.
[79.80 → 80.80] Which is great news.
[80.80 → 82.80] Because we needed another music streaming platform.
[82.80 → 84.80] Yeah, I needed another thing to subscribe to.
[84.80 → 86.80] Okay, I'm actually...
[86.80 → 87.80] Okay, I...
[87.80 → 89.80] This is about to get really bad.
[89.80 → 90.80] Okay.
[90.80 → 93.20] So, Taylor Swift's album...
[93.20 → 95.20] Oh...
[95.20 → 97.20] Oh, no, you didn't.
[97.20 → 97.80] Just hold on.
[97.80 → 98.20] Just hold on.
[98.20 → 99.20] You did, didn't you?
[99.20 → 100.20] Just for that.
[100.20 → 101.00] You know what?
[101.00 → 102.20] We'll talk about it later.
[102.20 → 103.20] No-oh!
[103.20 → 104.20] Also, Magic Leap.
[104.20 → 106.20] Magic Leap finally has a product.
[106.20 → 107.20] Yes.
[107.20 → 108.20] You ordered it?
[108.20 → 109.20] Well, I signed up.
[109.20 → 110.20] You can't order it yet.
[110.20 → 111.20] Oh, okay.
[111.20 → 113.20] So I signed up, so I'm expecting, you know, 10 years might show up.
[113.20 → 117.20] So we'll talk about the ultimate secrecy, freaking...
[117.20 → 118.20] These guys are ridiculous.
[118.20 → 121.00] I don't know how they got funding, because they didn't...
[121.00 → 122.00] They've never shown anything.
[122.00 → 123.00] No, they have.
[123.00 → 124.00] Only behind, like...
[124.00 → 125.00] Individually.
[125.00 → 126.00] Yes.
[126.00 → 128.00] Like, NDA'd literally up the rectum.
[128.00 → 129.00] Yeah.
[129.00 → 130.00] So no one's ever...
[130.00 → 131.00] No one knows what's going on in there.
[131.00 → 132.00] Until inside.
[132.00 → 133.00] Until inside.
[133.00 → 134.00] Okay!
[134.00 → 135.00] And...
[135.00 → 136.00] Intro time.
[136.00 → 137.00] Oh, oh, oh.
[137.00 → 138.00] Oh, oh.
[138.00 → 139.00] Oh, oh.
[139.00 → 140.00] Oh, oh.
[140.00 → 141.00] Oh, oh.
[141.00 → 143.00] See, yes, it made it harder to change.
[143.00 → 144.00] Gotta do that.
[144.00 → 145.00] Oh, oh.
[145.00 → 146.00] Oh, oh.
[146.00 → 147.00] Oh, oh.
[147.00 → 148.00] Oh, oh.
[148.00 → 163.80] I can just talk louder.
[163.80 → 164.80] I can just talk louder.
[164.80 → 165.80] Does that work for everybody?
[165.80 → 166.80] Hooray!
[166.80 → 167.80] It's Squarespace!
[167.80 → 168.80] Is that cool for everybody?
[168.80 → 169.80] Fresh Mugs!
[169.80 → 170.80] Okay.
[170.80 → 172.80] We could just yell all show.
[172.80 → 173.80] I'm down.
[173.80 → 174.80] Let's do it.
[174.80 → 175.80] I'm down to yell all show.
[175.80 → 176.80] Heck yeah.
[176.80 → 178.60] Oh, apparently rip, rip ears, rip ears.
[178.60 → 179.60] Oh, sorry everyone.
[179.60 → 180.60] Oh.
[180.60 → 181.60] Apparently it got louder so...
[181.60 → 183.60] I have no idea what you people are talking about.
[183.60 → 184.60] Um...
[184.60 → 186.60] That's a global audio setting, so...
[186.60 → 188.60] Yeah, I don't know what's going on.
[188.60 → 189.60] Okay.
[189.60 → 194.60] So why don't we get into our first topic for the day.
[194.60 → 195.60] Apple.
[195.60 → 196.60] This article.
[196.60 → 198.40] This was posted by Dr. McIntosh.
[198.40 → 200.40] Was, was, on the forum.
[200.40 → 204.40] The original article that we have here is from Yahoo Finance.
[204.40 → 206.40] It's posted in Twitch chat.
[206.40 → 207.40] That's an odd one.
[207.40 → 209.40] I don't think I have actually...
[209.40 → 211.40] Which one have we tested?
[211.40 → 214.40] Is that the Luke one or is that the minus one?
[214.40 → 216.40] Do we have any idea if either of these are actually working?
[216.40 → 217.40] This one works, I believe.
[217.40 → 218.40] That one works?
[218.40 → 219.40] Okay.
[219.40 → 220.40] Let's...
[220.40 → 224.40] Let's see what happens.
[224.40 → 225.40] Yeah!
[225.40 → 226.40] All right.
[226.40 → 227.40] Rock on.
[227.40 → 232.40] So about a week ago, a massively popular and widely circulated thread on Reddit posited
[232.40 → 238.40] that Apple purposely slows down performance on iPhones with older batteries.
[238.40 → 243.40] Which people have been thinking for kind of ever.
[243.40 → 244.40] Yeah.
[244.40 → 246.40] But now we've been able to, you know...
[246.40 → 250.30] So in a nutshell, iPhone users have noticed their older phones not performing as well
[250.30 → 253.40] as they did before iOS 10.2.1.
[253.40 → 261.40] But they've also noticed that performance can increase after getting a new battery.
[261.40 → 267.40] So it turns out that Apple has admitted that they are intentionally gating the amount of
[267.40 → 270.70] power that the CPU demands from the battery.
[270.70 → 275.04] This is because the phone will shut down to protect itself if the CPU demands more power
[275.04 → 276.84] than it can supply.
[276.84 → 280.54] So there are three scenarios where batteries are less likely to be able to produce the
[280.54 → 283.04] big bursts of power that the CPU might ask for.
[283.04 → 286.04] When they're cold.
[286.04 → 288.04] When they're low.
[288.04 → 290.64] And when the battery has degraded over time.
[290.64 → 299.64] So what this means is that right out of the box, you might run into a situation where your CPU effectively throttles for a reason other than thermals.
[299.64 → 302.64] Except that it could be thermals, but cold thermals, not hot thermals.
[302.64 → 303.64] Yes.
[303.64 → 304.64] If...
[304.64 → 307.64] But the other takeaway here.
[307.64 → 308.64] Which gets a little confusing.
[308.64 → 315.64] The third reason means that out of a hundred iPhones, how many of them will slow down?
[315.64 → 316.64] A hundred.
[316.64 → 317.64] A hundred.
[317.64 → 318.64] Yeah.
[318.64 → 323.64] If it will throttle once the battery decays, well I shouldn't say decays, degrades.
[323.64 → 324.64] Degrades, yeah.
[324.64 → 325.64] They don't necessarily decay.
[325.64 → 329.64] I mean, if you put enough chicken soup on them, they could probably decay.
[329.64 → 335.64] Do you remember that old camera we used to use for tech tips videos, Lines Tech Tips videos that I got the chicken soup on?
[335.64 → 336.64] Yeah.
[336.64 → 337.64] That decayed.
[337.64 → 338.64] Oh.
[338.64 → 339.64] Yeah.
[339.64 → 342.64] I was in my backpack for like over a span of a week, I didn't realize.
[342.64 → 343.64] Yeah.
[343.64 → 344.64] Chicken soup.
[344.64 → 345.64] Hot backpack.
[345.64 → 346.64] I didn't know it actually decayed.
[346.64 → 347.64] Well, it smelled.
[347.64 → 348.64] Okay.
[348.64 → 349.64] So the soup decayed.
[349.64 → 350.64] But the soup, that's not the same thing.
[350.64 → 351.64] Well, I don't know.
[351.64 → 353.64] Oh, the contacts in the battery compartment were like corroded and stuff.
[353.64 → 354.64] Okay, that makes sense.
[354.64 → 355.64] It's still not decayed.
[355.64 → 356.64] It's kind of a decay of sort.
[356.64 → 357.64] It's erosion.
[357.64 → 358.64] Well, you know.
[358.64 → 360.64] I've had enough of your crap.
[360.64 → 361.64] Okay.
[361.64 → 363.64] How long do I have to put up with you again?
[363.64 → 365.64] Like when's your last day at Linus Media Group?
[365.64 → 366.64] Like slightly over a week.
[366.64 → 367.64] Yeah, like just over a week.
[367.64 → 368.64] Perfect.
[368.64 → 369.64] Perfect.
[369.64 → 370.64] I'll be working soon enough.
[370.64 → 371.64] One week, two days.
[371.64 → 375.64] I'll get to put down that piece of tape that will make it totally different from before.
[375.64 → 376.64] Yeah.
[376.64 → 379.64] You'll be working in a separate office.
[379.64 → 383.64] In an office all by myself while I talk to people over the internet.
[383.64 → 384.64] Marked by the masking tape.
[384.64 → 385.64] Yeah.
[385.64 → 386.64] That'll be your office.
[386.64 → 387.64] Yeah.
[387.64 → 388.64] And I won't have to be in it.
[388.64 → 390.64] Except when I have to meet with you about flow plane stuff.
[390.64 → 394.64] Oh, oh, oh, we should talk about flow plane stuff on the show.
[394.64 → 395.64] Come on.
[395.64 → 398.64] I want to show the pre-alpha site.
[398.64 → 407.64] Oh, but see, every single time that this happens, people get confused despite no matter how many times I say, this isn't the site you're supposed to be using.
[407.64 → 408.64] Everyone goes to go use it.
[408.64 → 409.64] Okay.
[409.64 → 415.64] Also, you never actually ended up telling all the editors that they're supposed to upload things in a certain way and use that setting.
[415.64 → 416.64] So it hasn't been being used.
[416.64 → 419.64] So there are things that aren't supposed to be viewed yet on there.
[419.64 → 422.64] And you're not going to tell them until next week.
[422.64 → 423.64] And then you'll probably forget.
[423.64 → 424.64] So it's really not.
[424.64 → 427.64] Up to you.
[427.64 → 428.64] I'll think about it.
[428.64 → 429.64] I'll think about it.
[429.64 → 431.64] People are going to be seeing videos with the wrong titles.
[431.64 → 432.64] I'll think about it.
[432.64 → 433.64] I'll think about it.
[433.64 → 434.64] Okay.
[434.64 → 435.64] Anyway.
[435.64 → 437.64] The flow plane side of things going great.
[437.64 → 439.64] We have a new live stream panel thing set up.
[439.64 → 440.64] So did you talk to them?
[440.64 → 441.64] We can show it.
[441.64 → 442.64] We'll show it later.
[442.64 → 443.64] And yes, I did.
[443.64 → 444.64] He's not streaming until later tonight.
[444.64 → 445.64] We can talk about that later.
[445.64 → 446.64] We're going to go through the you know what?
[446.64 → 447.64] We're doing it.
[447.64 → 448.64] Okay.
[448.64 → 449.64] I'm going through the thing.
[449.64 → 450.64] Because I'm amped.
[450.64 → 451.64] I'm amped.
[451.64 → 452.64] Anyway.
[452.64 → 453.64] So starting with iOS 10.2.1,
[453.64 → 457.64] Mac CPU power draws stepped down in proportion to battery capability.
[457.64 → 461.64] It's not just like your battery is good, so your phone runs at full speed,
[461.64 → 462.64] or your battery is a little bad.
[462.64 → 463.64] Okay.
[463.64 → 464.64] The Twitch chat is really confused about me leaving.
[464.64 → 466.64] Might want to explain that.
[466.64 → 467.64] Okay.
[468.64 → 469.64] Starting January 1st.
[469.64 → 470.64] All right.
[470.64 → 471.64] All right.
[471.64 → 472.64] Okay.
[472.64 → 473.64] Can I finish the Apple battery thing, and then can we get into that?
[473.64 → 474.64] Okay.
[474.64 → 475.64] We'll come back to that.
[475.64 → 476.64] We'll come back to that.
[476.64 → 477.64] It's not that scary.
[477.64 → 478.64] Don't worry about it.
[478.64 → 479.64] I mean, it's.
[479.64 → 480.64] Are you a little scared?
[480.64 → 481.64] It throws me off pretty hard.
[481.64 → 482.64] Yeah.
[482.64 → 483.64] Okay.
[483.64 → 484.64] Okay.
[484.64 → 485.64] Anyway.
[485.64 → 486.64] Anyway.
[486.64 → 487.64] So, it's not a matter of like your battery is good, or your battery is bad.
[487.64 → 490.64] So your performance is like great or your performance is like poo.
[490.64 → 491.64] Yeah.
[491.64 → 492.64] It's like it's a spectrum, you know?
[492.64 → 498.64] So this was originally applied to the iPhone SE 6 and has now been applied to the iPhone
[498.64 → 501.64] 7 and the 6S, and it's being planned for future devices.
[501.64 → 503.64] So part of the problem though.
[503.64 → 504.64] Okay.
[504.64 → 507.64] They could have bricked the phones up front instead of bricking them a year after launch.
[507.64 → 509.64] And they wouldn't be as oppressive and competitive.
[509.64 → 510.64] Okay.
[510.64 → 511.64] You know what?
[511.64 → 515.64] Let's get into this because the rest of this is all kind of opinion stuff.
[515.64 → 516.64] Hit me.
[516.64 → 517.64] What are your thoughts?
[517.64 → 520.64] I don't like it.
[520.64 → 521.64] Okay.
[521.64 → 523.64] Can I play devil's advocate on this one?
[523.64 → 524.64] Yeah.
[524.64 → 528.64] Because if you're going to not like it, then I'm going to make the counterargument here.
[528.64 → 535.64] Your Android phone gets slow within a matter of weeks anyway, even if the battery is perfect.
[535.64 → 539.64] I haven't really used an iPhone very much, but don't they do pretty much the same thing?
[539.64 → 540.64] No, never mind.
[540.64 → 542.64] And mine doesn't do it in a matter of weeks to be fair.
[542.64 → 543.64] Okay.
[543.64 → 544.64] So the Pixel lasts a little longer.
[544.64 → 545.64] It lasts quite a while.
[545.64 → 546.64] Quite a while longer.
[546.64 → 549.64] And then I just reformatted it, and then it was totally fine again.
[549.64 → 550.64] I'm on the Pixel 2 XL right now.
[550.64 → 552.64] I'm quite happy with the...
[552.64 → 553.64] Yeah.
[553.64 → 555.64] Mine took like over half a year.
[555.64 → 556.64] Okay.
[556.64 → 557.64] Look, I'm not supposed to be on your side.
[557.64 → 558.64] So...
[558.64 → 560.64] And then I reformatted it, and then it was fine again.
[560.64 → 565.64] Let's bear in mind thought that like Samsung owns the lion's share of Android right now.
[565.64 → 566.64] Okay.
[566.64 → 567.64] And...
[567.64 → 568.64] I'm not defending Samsung.
[568.64 → 569.64] Yeah.
[569.64 → 570.64] So, okay.
[570.64 → 573.64] So, you know, hey, at least your performance is good for a year on the iPhone.
[573.64 → 575.64] But then you can just...
[575.64 → 576.64] You can't do that on an iPhone.
[576.64 → 577.64] It doesn't solve the problem.
[577.64 → 578.64] No, it doesn't solve the problem.
[578.64 → 579.64] You're right.
[579.64 → 581.64] So I have the ability to solve the problem.
[581.64 → 582.64] Okay.
[582.64 → 583.64] iPhone doesn't.
[583.64 → 584.64] You're not winning here.
[584.64 → 585.64] Um...
[585.64 → 589.64] Okay, yeah.
[589.64 → 590.64] I don't like that.
[590.64 → 595.64] Because this way, like say I'm not a techie person.
[595.64 → 596.64] Look, I tried.
[596.64 → 597.64] Yeah.
[597.64 → 598.64] Look.
[598.64 → 600.64] Say I'm not a...
[600.64 → 601.64] Say I'm not a...
[601.64 → 603.64] I read rest in the chat.
[603.64 → 604.64] Say I'm not a techie person.
[604.64 → 605.64] Yeah, let's say that.
[605.64 → 606.64] And you're my buddy.
[606.64 → 607.64] Sure.
[607.64 → 608.64] And you're like, wow.
[608.64 → 610.64] Way to be with that little eye gesture thing.
[610.64 → 611.64] Um...
[611.64 → 614.64] And I have a phone, and I'm complaining to you that it got slower.
[614.64 → 615.64] Yeah.
[615.64 → 618.64] If it's an Android phone, you can be like, hey, back up all your stuff, reformat it, put
[618.64 → 619.64] it back on, everything's fine.
[619.64 → 621.64] If it's an iPhone, you can be like...
[624.64 → 625.64] Go buy a new iPhone.
[625.64 → 626.64] I guess.
[626.64 → 627.64] Yeah.
[627.64 → 628.64] Yeah.
[628.64 → 636.64] So, really the upsetting thing here is no Apple, um, degrading the performance to me.
[636.64 → 643.64] That actually doesn't bother me, and it wouldn't surprise me if other people were doing it, and it wouldn't be a big deal to me.
[643.64 → 644.64] Oh, yeah.
[644.64 → 648.64] I would not be even remotely surprised at all if it was on the other side of the field as well.
[648.64 → 649.64] Yeah.
[649.64 → 663.64] And the other part that is bothering me is that Apple is shipping these devices with batteries that are not only not user upgradeable, because that ship has sailed, I've gotten over that, but that are difficult to DIY repair upgrade.
[663.64 → 664.64] Yeah.
[664.64 → 666.64] Or, I shouldn't have said user upgradeable, user replaceable.
[666.64 → 671.64] But they're difficult, even as someone with a reasonable amount of DIY knowledge.
[671.64 → 675.64] Like, I have replaced phone batteries before, even on ones with non-replaceable batteries.
[675.64 → 676.64] Yeah.
[676.64 → 679.64] Like, it's not rocket science if you're careful and you go slow.
[679.64 → 680.64] Yeah.
[680.64 → 692.64] Um, but they're making these devices that are difficult to replace the battery for, and they are running them so close to the red line that surely they must know.
[692.64 → 701.64] When they're shipping these things, because it's not like lithium-ion or lithium polymer batteries are especially new technology at this point.
[701.64 → 705.64] Apple in particular has done tons of research in this field.
[705.64 → 709.64] They know exactly what's going to happen with this thing.
[709.64 → 710.64] Yeah.
[710.64 → 712.64] Pretty much perfectly.
[712.64 → 717.64] And they're making a conscious decision to, like, the fact that the iPhone 7 is affected.
[717.64 → 727.64] They're making a conscious decision to run them so close to the red line, sorry, this side, red line, that they can only handle it for a year.
[727.64 → 732.64] Can you imagine if a car manufacturer did this?
[732.64 → 737.64] Like, let's say for example that Volkswagen, nothing against Volkswagen.
[737.64 → 738.64] Let's say for example-
[738.64 → 741.64] And they're like, not that long ago giant issues, but yeah.
[741.64 → 742.64] Yeah.
[742.64 → 748.64] Let's say for example Volkswagen shipped a car that had great emissions for the first year.
[748.64 → 749.64] Okay?
[749.64 → 750.64] Yeah.
[750.64 → 763.64] And then, when all the press had stopped benchmarking it, and all those users, well, they're just plum out of warranty.
[763.64 → 775.64] Let's say, hypothetically, that when nobody was looking, they made it, so the emissions were bad.
[775.64 → 778.64] Would that not be kind of similar?
[778.64 → 786.64] And now, to be clear, we're not talking about a 10-year-old car that just don't run the way it used to.
[786.64 → 787.64] That's okay.
[787.64 → 788.64] This is very targeted.
[788.64 → 793.64] You know, that's why, you know, that's why, well, BC used to anyway.
[793.64 → 797.64] BC had a program called Air Care where people would have to take very old vehicles.
[797.64 → 798.64] Yeah.
[798.64 → 802.64] And they would have to demonstrate that they've been keeping them up well enough that they don't have horrible emissions.
[802.64 → 803.64] It was really difficult.
[803.64 → 804.64] It was like a huge problem.
[804.64 → 805.64] To get my red card.
[805.64 → 806.64] To get my red card.
[806.64 → 812.64] And, you know, I had a car before that I used to have to make sure I had a nice fresh oil change in it.
[812.64 → 815.64] Nice fresh oil change, driving on the highway for a while.
[815.64 → 816.64] For a while.
[816.64 → 817.64] Anyway.
[817.64 → 818.64] Premium gas.
[818.64 → 819.64] Yeah.
[819.64 → 820.64] We know all the...
[820.64 → 821.64] Anyway.
[821.64 → 824.64] So, the point is, this is...
[824.64 → 826.64] I really don't think...
[826.64 → 827.64] Okay, so my iPhone 4.
[827.64 → 829.64] My iPhone 4 is really slow.
[829.64 → 830.64] And I get it.
[830.64 → 835.64] That's a ancient device that also, you know, is not getting security updates anymore.
[835.64 → 840.64] Like, really has no right to be used, like, as a daily driver at this point.
[840.64 → 841.64] And I could...
[841.64 → 853.64] And the thing, too, is like, I could replace it with something that would be a much better experience for an amount of money that I consider reasonable to tell someone, just upgrade your device.
[853.64 → 856.64] Like, I could upgrade to an iPhone 5S.
[856.64 → 857.64] And that would be way better.
[857.64 → 858.64] I could get a cheap 5S.
[858.64 → 859.64] I'd get a way better experience.
[859.64 → 861.64] And I could probably do that for...
[861.64 → 862.64] I don't know what a 5S is worth.
[862.64 → 864.64] It can't be more than, like, around a hundred bucks.
[864.64 → 865.64] Like, I can't even...
[865.64 → 866.64] Yeah, not very much.
[866.64 → 867.64] I don't know.
[867.64 → 868.64] I don't know.
[868.64 → 869.64] Don't quote me on that.
[869.64 → 874.64] The point is, Apple is not doing that with 6-year-old devices.
[874.64 → 883.64] Apple is doing this with devices that are well within what I would consider to be the prime of their lives.
[883.64 → 885.64] A 1-year-old phone is not an old phone.
[885.64 → 891.64] You're looking at used 150, give or take 1020, and new 200, 240.
[891.64 → 892.64] Okay.
[892.64 → 896.64] But I consider a used phone, if you're on a budget, a perfectly reasonable thing to do.
[896.64 → 897.64] Yeah.
[897.64 → 898.64] So I'm not that far off.
[901.64 → 907.64] So I can't defend what they're doing because it really feels misleading for them to be chasing that headline.
[907.64 → 908.64] They're chasing that headline.
[908.64 → 910.64] The iPhone's the fastest.
[910.64 → 914.64] Have they posted anything in response to this?
[916.64 → 917.64] I'm actually...
[917.64 → 918.64] You know what?
[918.64 → 919.64] To be perfectly honest, I'm not sure.
[919.64 → 929.64] If I flip sides on you a little bit, I wonder if there is some legitimate technical reason to the point of trying to reduce issues with these batteries.
[929.64 → 930.64] Mm-hmm.
[930.64 → 937.64] Maybe using them at the same rate as before could produce critical situations where you have...
[937.64 → 938.64] Because batteries...
[938.64 → 939.64] Shutdowns.
[939.64 → 940.64] Sorry?
[940.64 → 941.64] Shutdowns.
[941.64 → 942.64] Shutdowns.
[942.64 → 943.64] The other thing is to prevent shutdowns.
[943.64 → 944.64] Yeah, preventing shutdowns.
[944.64 → 945.64] No, we talked about that already.
[945.64 → 946.64] Preventing shutdowns.
[946.64 → 947.64] Battery issues.
[947.64 → 953.64] Having a lithium-ion battery in your pocket is like not cool.
[953.64 → 955.64] And has become really common.
[955.64 → 957.64] But is like super sketchy.
[957.64 → 962.64] And luckily, these manufacturers of things have been doing things mostly right outside of Samsung that one time.
[962.64 → 963.64] You know?
[963.64 → 964.64] Yeah.
[964.64 → 965.64] Bombs.
[965.64 → 967.64] You know, funny to joke about now.
[967.64 → 968.64] So, I don't know.
[968.64 → 971.64] It could have something to do with that.
[971.64 → 974.64] I haven't personally seen an official statement anywhere.
[974.64 → 975.64] Yeah.
[975.64 → 976.64] They've acknowledged that they're doing it.
[976.64 → 978.64] They've said it to prevent shutdowns.
[978.64 → 993.64] But basically, the cold hard truth is they're only doing this so that they can run it right at the red line for a while knowing that no one's going to benchmark it and no one's going to give this the kind of press.
[993.64 → 994.64] Like, even now.
[994.64 → 995.64] We're talking about it now.
[995.64 → 1001.64] But when the iPhone X2 or whatever, maybe they'll take on like a Final Fantasy-issue sort of naming scheme.
[1001.64 → 1002.64] Nice.
[1002.64 → 1003.64] Yeah, I like it.
[1003.64 → 1004.64] I don't know what they're going to do.
[1004.64 → 1005.64] Yeah.
[1005.64 → 1007.64] Maybe when the iPhone X2 rolls around.
[1007.64 → 1010.64] By the time that happens, we're not going to be talking about this again.
[1010.64 → 1014.64] We're not going to be like, here's the review of the new iPhone X2.
[1014.64 → 1017.64] By the way, your iPhone X now performs like this.
[1017.64 → 1020.64] And your iPhone 8 now performs like this.
[1020.64 → 1021.64] Wow.
[1021.64 → 1022.64] You should.
[1022.64 → 1025.64] But you can't because it won't even necessarily be applicable.
[1025.64 → 1028.64] Maybe mine is still running at 98%.
[1028.64 → 1032.64] But maybe there are other people out there who, let's say, they use wireless charging all the time.
[1032.64 → 1033.64] Uh.
[1033.64 → 1038.64] Which, by the way, like, Apple won't say, yes, it degrades it.
[1038.64 → 1043.64] And I can't say, like, with absolute certainty, yes, it will degrade at this amount.
[1043.64 → 1046.64] But it will degrade it some amount.
[1046.64 → 1047.64] We don't know how much.
[1047.64 → 1048.64] But heat is bad.
[1048.64 → 1049.64] We know this.
[1049.64 → 1051.64] Heat is bad for batteries.
[1051.64 → 1054.64] And wireless charging produces more heat.
[1054.64 → 1060.64] So someone who's running around, like, leaving their phone on a wireless charger, trickle charging all the time, for example.
[1060.64 → 1064.64] Or who just uses a wireless charger at night unnecessarily instead of plugging in.
[1064.64 → 1069.64] And they could be at risk of actually degrading the performance of their phone a year or two down the line.
[1069.64 → 1073.64] So this is something, like, we're going to want to keep talking about.
[1073.64 → 1075.64] But I really don't know if it's, uh.
[1075.64 → 1080.64] I really don't know if it's going to keep people's attention the way that a shiny, fast new iPhone does.
[1080.64 → 1081.64] Okay.
[1081.64 → 1082.64] Um.
[1082.64 → 1085.64] Let's get, let's get through our sponsors.
[1085.64 → 1086.64] Sure.
[1086.64 → 1088.64] And then we'll talk about Luke leaving Linus Media Group.
[1088.64 → 1089.64] Sure.
[1089.64 → 1091.64] See how I made them stay tuned like that?
[1091.64 → 1092.64] Whew!
[1092.64 → 1093.64] Whoa!
[1093.64 → 1098.64] Uh, so first up is Squarespace.
[1098.64 → 1099.64] Think about it.
[1099.64 → 1104.64] This might be your last Squarespace sponsor spot as an LMG employee.
[1104.64 → 1106.64] Are they, are they, oh, okay, yeah.
[1106.64 → 1107.64] Ooh.
[1107.64 → 1108.64] Isn't that crazy?
[1108.64 → 1109.64] Maybe.
[1109.64 → 1110.64] Uh, no, I think we're going to continue.
[1110.64 → 1111.64] You also put a little bit of a spoiler in there.
[1111.64 → 1113.64] I think we're going to continue working with Squarespace for a long time.
[1113.64 → 1114.64] Yeah.
[1114.64 → 1115.64] But, uh.
[1115.64 → 1119.64] Is the place to go to, you know, let's say you weren't employed with your old employer
[1119.64 → 1120.64] anymore.
[1120.64 → 1123.64] Let's say you had to create an online portfolio to, you know.
[1123.64 → 1124.64] Wow!
[1124.64 → 1126.64] To, to, to, to, too.
[1126.64 → 1127.64] Jesus.
[1127.64 → 1134.64] If I needed to do that, I'd have 24-7 live chat and email support, which would be great.
[1134.64 → 1138.64] It would only cost me $12 a month because apparently I don't have a job anymore, except
[1138.64 → 1139.64] I do.
[1139.64 → 1140.64] Not here.
[1140.64 → 1141.64] Jerk.
[1141.64 → 1142.64] Um.
[1142.64 → 1146.64] Uh, all their great templates feature responsive design, so they'll look great if your potential
[1146.64 → 1151.64] employer is looking at them on a laptop computer or on their slow year-old phone.
[1151.64 → 1156.64] They've got a lot of great features like their logo designer and cover pages, uh, the ability
[1156.64 → 1160.64] to publish content in Apple news format directly from the Squarespace blog.
[1160.64 → 1162.64] Every site includes commerce.
[1162.64 → 1166.64] Like if you wanted to, I don't know, spend all that spare time that you might have, uh,
[1166.64 → 1171.64] weaving little Etsy baskets, you could sell them through your Squarespace store.
[1171.64 → 1172.64] Basket weaving, yes.
[1172.64 → 1173.64] Uh.
[1173.64 → 1175.64] If you, if you sign up for a year, you get a free domain.
[1175.64 → 1176.64] Yep.
[1176.64 → 1181.64] So head over to squarespace.com slash when and use offer code when to get 10% off.
[1181.64 → 1182.64] Nice.
[1182.64 → 1186.64] Which leads us right into our next sponsor spot, fixity.
[1186.64 → 1190.64] So let's say that the basket weaving doesn't, doesn't work out for you there.
[1190.64 → 1191.64] Yeah.
[1191.64 → 1193.64] Maybe you want to get into small time electronics repair.
[1193.64 → 1194.64] Like replacing batteries and phones.
[1194.64 → 1197.64] fixity has got the tools for you.
[1197.64 → 1203.64] They've got everything from suction cups to their 64-bit driver kit to their like big tool
[1203.64 → 1208.64] pack with like the magnetic sheet that has all the little, uh, it's like dry erase so you
[1208.64 → 1211.64] can write what everything is, and you can stick all the screws to it.
[1211.64 → 1212.64] Super handy.
[1212.64 → 1213.64] ESD straps.
[1213.64 → 1215.64] They've got everything, and they've got the guides.
[1215.64 → 1219.64] So you won't actually know, have to know a damn thing about electronic repair.
[1219.64 → 1220.64] Yeah.

[1278.64 → 1282.64] As for me, LMG, owing you anything, that's going to be nothing.
[1282.64 → 1283.64] So, you know, well...
[1283.64 → 1284.64] I mean, technically.
[1284.64 → 1285.64] Technically, well, okay.
[1285.64 → 1290.64] Well, yeah, I think it's going to be the other way around because you, you get the...
[1290.64 → 1291.64] Okay, well, we'll get into that.
[1291.64 → 1292.64] We'll get into that.
[1292.64 → 1293.64] Yeah.
[1293.64 → 1294.64] Yeah.
[1294.64 → 1295.64] FreshBooks has tons of great features.

[1322.64 → 1327.64] Attempted fate, I've said, it's one of the sponsors, one of the few sponsors that we
[1327.64 → 1328.64] have never gotten a complaint about.
[1328.64 → 1329.64] And it still hasn't.
[1329.64 → 1330.64] We still haven't.
[1330.64 → 1331.64] And we still haven't gotten one.
[1331.64 → 1332.64] Yeah.
[1332.64 → 1333.64] Nothing credible.
[1333.64 → 1337.64] I shouldn't say we've never gotten one because we might have gotten something, but I've never...
[1337.64 → 1342.64] Because I will actually escalate things personally to a brand if something comes through and
[1342.64 → 1345.64] they're an actual customer, but nothing has ever made it to my desk.
[1345.64 → 1347.64] I have never seen a comment.

[1355.64 → 1356.64] Oh, that's weird.
[1356.64 → 1357.64] Our lower third says slash WAN.
[1357.64 → 1358.64] Well, try them both.
[1358.64 → 1361.64] All right.
[1361.64 → 1364.64] So, you're leaving Linus Media Group.
[1364.64 → 1365.64] Or are you being fired?
[1365.64 → 1366.64] I don't...
[1366.64 → 1367.64] I literally don't know.
[1367.64 → 1368.64] How is that going to work?
[1368.64 → 1369.64] Does that have to...
[1369.64 → 1371.64] That has to legally work in a way, right?
[1371.64 → 1372.64] Oh, yeah.
[1372.64 → 1373.64] Oh, yeah.
[1373.64 → 1374.64] Like you're gone.
[1374.64 → 1375.64] You're done.
[1375.64 → 1376.64] No, I know.
[1376.64 → 1377.64] But which one...
[1377.64 → 1378.64] Oh.
[1378.64 → 1379.64] Uh...
[1379.64 → 1380.64] No, I'm...
[1380.64 → 1381.64] Well, no.
[1381.64 → 1382.64] It's that.
[1382.64 → 1383.64] It's fired, quit, or laid off.
[1383.64 → 1384.64] Yeah.
[1384.64 → 1385.64] And you're not laid off.
[1385.64 → 1386.64] So I think technically you have to quit.
[1386.64 → 1387.64] I have to quit.
[1387.64 → 1388.64] You have to quit.
[1388.64 → 1389.64] Oh, this sucks.
[1389.64 → 1390.64] What if I don't quit?
[1390.64 → 1391.64] This sucks.
[1391.64 → 1392.64] Um...
[1392.64 → 1393.64] What happens?
[1393.64 → 1394.64] Um...
[1394.64 → 1395.64] Yeah.
[1395.64 → 1397.64] No, I'm pretty sure you have to quit.
[1397.64 → 1400.64] Because your other employer, Float plane Media...
[1400.64 → 1403.64] It's going to be like, what the hell?
[1403.64 → 1404.64] Yeah.
[1404.64 → 1406.64] It's going to be like, uh, yo...
[1406.64 → 1411.64] By the way, it may actually be a conflict of interest for you to maintain your position.
[1411.64 → 1412.64] It would be.
[1412.64 → 1413.64] Yeah, it absolutely would be.
[1413.64 → 1414.64] Yeah.
[1414.64 → 1415.64] So, um...
[1415.64 → 1418.64] So Luke is not quitting.
[1418.64 → 1421.64] He's just quitting.
[1421.64 → 1422.64] Um...
[1422.64 → 1423.64] Yeah, confusing.
[1423.64 → 1424.64] So I'm still going to be on WAN Show.
[1424.64 → 1428.64] If Linus ever actually lets me, uh, make a video, I will make a video.
[1428.64 → 1429.64] Uh, I'm going to be at CES.
[1429.64 → 1431.64] We're working on that one soon together.
[1431.64 → 1432.64] Oh, yeah.
[1432.64 → 1433.64] That's not really...
[1433.64 → 1434.64] Oh, that's going to be fun.
[1434.64 → 1435.64] It'll be fun, but it's not like a...
[1435.64 → 1436.64] Yeah.
[1436.64 → 1437.64] It's not real video.
[1437.64 → 1438.64] And you have that...
[1438.64 → 1439.64] I'm not sure if I should make a video on that thing.
[1439.64 → 1440.64] I think you should.
[1440.64 → 1441.64] I don't...
[1441.64 → 1442.64] It's not as cool.
[1442.64 → 1443.64] Oh.
[1443.64 → 1444.64] Alright.
[1444.64 → 1449.64] Well, if nothing else, we could do the classic React and just have some fun with it.
[1449.64 → 1450.64] Yeah.
[1450.64 → 1451.64] Yeah.
[1451.64 → 1452.64] Anyway, we'll...
[1452.64 → 1453.64] We'll still do some stuff.
[1453.64 → 1454.64] Why is this broken?
[1454.64 → 1455.64] Um, you might need to sign out.
[1455.64 → 1456.64] Okay, okay.
[1456.64 → 1457.64] I got this.
[1457.64 → 1458.64] I got this.
[1458.64 → 1459.64] Um, okay, so...
[1459.64 → 1463.64] Anyway, Float plane has been my full-time thing for quite a while now.
[1463.64 → 1467.64] So most of this stuff is just stuff happening on paper that doesn't actually mean anything
[1467.64 → 1468.64] for you guys.
[1468.64 → 1470.64] I'm still going to be on WAN Show every week.
[1470.64 → 1471.64] Um...
[1471.64 → 1472.64] Uh...
[1472.64 → 1473.64] You'll be doing CES coverage.
[1473.64 → 1474.64] I'll be doing CES coverage.
[1474.64 → 1475.64] Yep.
[1475.64 → 1476.64] So I'll be making videos down there for sure.
[1476.64 → 1478.64] Uh, I won't be making as many as you.
[1478.64 → 1481.64] Until I get to handle, like, most of the load myself this year, which is great.
[1481.64 → 1482.64] Yeah.
[1482.64 → 1484.64] I'm hoping by next year to have some good time for that.
[1484.64 → 1485.64] Which I think...
[1485.64 → 1486.64] Which I think...
[1486.64 → 1489.64] Um, perceptionally confusion stuff with the scheduling side of things.
[1489.64 → 1491.64] I think I can do more than I'm currently scheduled for.
[1491.64 → 1492.64] Oh, okay.
[1492.64 → 1493.64] So we'll see how that goes.
[1493.64 → 1494.64] Sure.
[1494.64 → 1495.64] Um...
[1495.64 → 1496.64] Yeah, I...
[1496.64 → 1497.64] I...
[1497.64 → 1498.64] Yeah.
[1498.64 → 1499.64] Basically nothing's gonna change on your side of things.
[1499.64 → 1501.64] I'll still be doing CES.
[1501.64 → 1502.64] I'll still be doing WAN Show.
[1502.64 → 1504.64] I'm still going to be doing a video sometimes.
[1504.64 → 1505.64] Uh, just...
[1505.64 → 1507.64] Kind of, you know, not that often.
[1507.64 → 1511.64] Uh, and I will be more on paper.
[1511.64 → 1514.64] Same with everyone that is currently a float plane person.
[1514.64 → 1517.64] We'll be more on paper a float plane person.
[1517.64 → 1520.64] Because right now, we're all technically like Linus Media Group.
[1520.64 → 1523.64] Yeah, so right now, Linus Media Group is paying the bills.
[1523.64 → 1529.64] But starting January 1st, formally, Float plane Media is starting up as a separate company.
[1529.64 → 1530.64] Yeah.
[1530.64 → 1537.64] Uh, Float plane Media is acquiring the, uh, employees and the intellectual property from Linus Media Group.
[1537.64 → 1539.64] That will, um, the trademarks, all that kind of stuff.
[1539.64 → 1543.64] And it will become its own separate legal entity.
[1543.64 → 1544.64] Yes.
[1544.64 → 1548.64] So we were joking about it earlier on the show, but we are actually going to, like, put tape down on the floor.
[1548.64 → 1549.64] Yeah.
[1549.64 → 1550.64] Maybe put up a sign or something.
[1550.64 → 1551.64] Like, make it kind of fun.
[1551.64 → 1553.64] And Float plane Media will have an office.
[1553.64 → 1555.64] It'll be here within this building.
[1555.64 → 1556.64] Yeah.
[1556.64 → 1557.64] But legally speaking...
[1557.64 → 1559.64] Well, it'll be, it's like you're renting...
[1559.64 → 1560.64] You have to lease it.
[1560.64 → 1561.64] Yeah, it's like you're renting space.
[1561.64 → 1562.64] Yeah.
[1562.64 → 1566.64] Linus Media Group will be subleasing some of the property to Float plane Media.
[1566.64 → 1568.64] And Float plane Media, like, has to pay for it.
[1568.64 → 1569.64] Like, legally.
[1569.64 → 1571.64] You can't give stuff away, at least here in BC.
[1571.64 → 1572.64] Yeah.
[1572.64 → 1574.64] Like, you can't give away a car to a friend.
[1574.64 → 1577.64] Unless it's, like, under a certain value because...
[1577.64 → 1578.64] You have to pay tax on it.
[1578.64 → 1580.64] There's taxation problems with that.
[1580.64 → 1584.64] So, like, Linus Media Group can't just be like, we're buddies, you can use our office space.
[1584.64 → 1585.64] Yeah.
[1585.64 → 1592.64] So we have to actually start doing everything by the book, which is both terrifying and really exciting.
[1592.64 → 1593.64] Because...
[1593.64 → 1594.64] Yeah.
[1594.64 → 1598.64] I have something really cool to show you guys that we weren't 100% sure if we were going to show you.
[1598.64 → 1600.64] I still don't think it's a great idea, but you know what.
[1600.64 → 1601.64] I want to do it.
[1601.64 → 1602.64] This is so cool.
[1602.64 → 1603.64] Um...
[1603.64 → 1604.64] Ugh.
[1604.64 → 1605.64] Linus's screen.
[1605.64 → 1608.64] I'm even, I'm even going to put, I'm even just going to get rid of us.
[1608.64 → 1611.64] We're just going to, we're just going to go Float plane Front and Centre.
[1611.64 → 1612.64] Oh, yeah, that's all fine.
[1612.64 → 1613.64] That's just places I go.
[1613.64 → 1614.64] Um...
[1614.64 → 1615.64] Here we go.
[1615.64 → 1616.64] So this is the sign-in screen.
[1616.64 → 1621.64] Now, to be clear, this won't work for you guys yet.
[1621.64 → 1625.64] My account was manually created by manually creating entries in the database.
[1625.64 → 1626.64] We're just going to not talk about that.
[1626.64 → 1628.64] And we're not going to talk about that.
[1628.64 → 1630.64] Okay, what just happened?
[1630.64 → 1631.64] Lol.
[1631.64 → 1632.64] There it is.
[1632.64 → 1633.64] Okay.
[1633.64 → 1635.64] Crying out loud.
[1635.64 → 1636.64] Okay.
[1636.64 → 1644.64] So this is a sneak peek at the pre-alpha, pre-alpha of Floatplane.com.
[1644.64 → 1649.64] So you can see here, there are a few things.
[1649.64 → 1650.64] Like, what can I show?
[1650.64 → 1651.64] Should I click on a video?
[1651.64 → 1652.64] Sure.
[1652.64 → 1653.64] Okay.
[1653.64 → 1654.64] That one.
[1654.64 → 1655.64] So Racer Phone.
[1655.64 → 1659.64] The review of the Racer Phone is one of the videos that is up on Float plane, but is not
[1659.64 → 1661.64] yet up on YouTube.
[1661.64 → 1665.64] So you can see here, the video content is really front and centre in the design.
[1665.64 → 1666.64] Um...
[1666.64 → 1669.64] Some of these things are going to end up tweaked, just to be clear.
[1669.64 → 1674.64] Like this is, we're calling it pre-alpha, because everyone hears beta and thinks basic
[1674.64 → 1675.64] basically finished product.
[1675.64 → 1677.64] Yeah, because that's changed in my lifetime.
[1677.64 → 1678.64] Yeah.
[1678.64 → 1683.64] But this is, yeah, let's call it pre-alpha, even though it's, if you like go with how
[1683.64 → 1687.64] that structure worked when I was young, this is like a beta.
[1687.64 → 1692.64] If you go with how that structure works now, with things like the early access games on
[1692.64 → 1695.64] stream, then this is a like pre-alpha.
[1695.64 → 1698.64] So, however you want to see it, it's early on.
[1698.64 → 1699.64] Yeah.
[1699.64 → 1700.64] So...
[1700.64 → 1702.64] Man, that player.
[1702.64 → 1703.64] Love it.
[1703.64 → 1704.64] It looks good, man.
[1704.64 → 1708.64] So there's a lot of stuff that you might not have expected from a pre-alpha stage type
[1708.64 → 1709.64] product.
[1709.64 → 1711.64] So we've got thumbnail previews working.
[1711.64 → 1717.64] One of our guys, Yuki, has worked really hard and gotten it so that our colour profiles
[1717.64 → 1720.64] are wider than places like YouTube.
[1720.64 → 1724.64] So if you have something like a really dark shot, you'll be able to see more on our platform.
[1724.64 → 1726.64] We can't show you the proper comparison for that right now.
[1726.64 → 1727.64] It's not our content.
[1727.64 → 1729.64] And I don't think it would come through Twitch anyway.
[1729.64 → 1730.64] Yeah.
[1730.64 → 1731.64] So we can't really show you.
[1731.64 → 1736.64] Also, there's a guy that I don't know if I can say his name yet, I haven't asked him,
[1736.64 → 1739.64] has been working on live-streaming really heavily.
[1739.64 → 1740.64] You can see live testing.
[1740.64 → 1741.64] I don't think I'm currently running it right now.
[1741.64 → 1742.64] Yeah.
[1742.64 → 1743.64] No, that's fine.
[1743.64 → 1744.64] So we don't really worry about that.
[1744.64 → 1746.64] But should we talk about that?
[1746.64 → 1748.64] Yeah, I think we should totally talk about that.
[1748.64 → 1749.64] So, Nitwit.
[1749.64 → 1750.64] Hold on, I want to go a little bit.
[1750.64 → 1751.64] Oh, yeah.
[1751.64 → 1752.64] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1752.64 → 1753.64] Let's talk about that.
[1753.64 → 1754.64] Okay, hold on.
[1754.64 → 1755.64] Let's pull back to us for a second then.
[1755.64 → 1756.64] Yeah.
[1756.64 → 1763.64] So Kyle from Nitwit, he's going to be, the plan is, the last time I heard from him, is,
[1763.64 → 1768.64] oh, he's like, is now a good time for you to show me the ropes?
[1768.64 → 1769.64] No, I'm streaming right now, Kyle.
[1769.64 → 1777.64] So Kyle is actually planning to do the first public-facing Float plane livestream, like the
[1777.64 → 1781.64] first official one, not a test, tonight.
[1781.64 → 1787.64] So if you are subscribed to Nitwit Ultra on Float plane, then right now that's still running
[1787.64 → 1789.64] through the linus-techtips.com forum.
[1789.64 → 1790.64] Yeah.
[1790.64 → 1791.64] I'm just going to paste the link in the chat here.
[1791.64 → 1794.64] But another guy on the team that I don't know if I can say his name publicly has been
[1794.64 → 1798.64] working really hard on the new payment system, which is awesome, because the current payment
[1798.64 → 1799.64] system is horrible.
[1799.64 → 1800.64] Terrible.
[1800.64 → 1804.64] And we're going to do it right, and we're going to have an awesome payment system coming.
[1804.64 → 1805.64] Yeah.
[1805.64 → 1806.64] The best payment system.
[1806.64 → 1807.64] The best.
[1807.64 → 1809.64] The greatest payment system.
[1809.64 → 1810.64] So that's really exciting.
[1810.64 → 1812.64] So you guys might want to check out Nitwit.
[1812.64 → 1816.64] That'll be the first Float plane livestream from a creator.
[1816.64 → 1820.64] Let's just go back to this here, Linus's screen.
[1820.64 → 1822.64] So that's still running, which is good.
[1822.64 → 1829.64] Yeah, I can't show you guys right now, but we have a chat system working for the livestream,
[1829.64 → 1835.64] and that chat system has basic moderation tools and highlighting for when the creator
[1835.64 → 1840.64] talks in the chat, and all this other kind of really cool stuff that, I don't know if
[1840.64 → 1843.64] I can say name, has been working really hard on.
[1843.64 → 1845.64] And it actually looks pretty good.
[1845.64 → 1846.64] This is pretty cool.
[1846.64 → 1848.64] We've got comments working.
[1848.64 → 1853.64] We are going to have thumbs down because we believe that some comments deserve a thumb
[1853.64 → 1854.64] down, dammit.
[1854.64 → 1855.64] Yeah.
[1855.64 → 1856.64] They do.
[1856.64 → 1857.64] Downvoting is important.
[1857.64 → 1858.64] These are real people, by the way.
[1858.64 → 1859.64] These are people actually using the site.
[1859.64 → 1861.64] These are our pre-alpha testers.
[1861.64 → 1862.64] Yeah.
[1862.64 → 1863.64] So this is one.
[1863.64 → 1865.64] You can see it's shaded green because I thumbed it up.
[1865.64 → 1867.64] A few people thumbed that up.
[1867.64 → 1869.64] We don't have replies working, but that's coming.
[1869.64 → 1870.64] That's coming.
[1870.64 → 1871.64] Yep.
[1871.64 → 1872.64] We're working on the flow-plane team.
[1872.64 → 1876.64] Everyone on the flow-plane team has been going super hard.
[1876.64 → 1877.64] Yeah.
[1877.64 → 1884.64] I even told everybody that they could leave early today, and people are still talking
[1884.64 → 1888.64] in the work chat because they're watching the stream right now.
[1888.64 → 1892.64] I can see you on my phone, which is like, that's pretty hardcore.
[1892.64 → 1893.64] I don't know.
[1893.64 → 1894.64] So this is pretty cool.
[1894.64 → 1896.64] There's a live button here.
[1896.64 → 1901.64] So Kyle's channel, when he's live, hopefully we would be able to...
[1901.64 → 1902.64] Yeah.
[1902.64 → 1904.64] So we're going to have the standard, like there will be a thumbnail sitting here kind
[1904.64 → 1905.64] of situation thing.
[1905.64 → 1907.64] There will be some stuff you can fill in here.
[1907.64 → 1909.64] This is just placeholder text right now.
[1909.64 → 1912.64] I'm subscribed to Kyle, as you can see, and then this is a chat.
[1912.64 → 1913.64] Yeah.
[1913.64 → 1914.64] So you can talk.
[1914.64 → 1915.64] Hello, world.
[1915.64 → 1916.64] Hello.
[1916.64 → 1919.64] Let's go ahead and just do that there so you can...
[1919.64 → 1920.64] Oh, wait.
[1920.64 → 1921.64] They can see it already.
[1921.64 → 1924.64] So that's what the live-streaming will look like.
[1924.64 → 1926.64] Let's go ahead and go back to our stuff.
[1926.64 → 1928.64] We can talk about some of the stuff that's on there.
[1928.64 → 1931.64] So we've got the LG Gram late 2017.
[1931.64 → 1932.64] That video's up.
[1932.64 → 1934.64] We've got the best case under $35.
[1934.64 → 1938.64] This is what Luke was referring to earlier when he was saying the editors, when they upload
[1938.64 → 1940.64] the videos, are not using the real title.
[1940.64 → 1942.64] Like this is just our file name.
[1942.64 → 1943.64] Yeah.
[1943.64 → 1947.64] They don't realize that it's public facing now because that's a feature that we've had
[1947.64 → 1948.64] for a long time.
[1948.64 → 1951.64] The ability to put a title and description and keywords and stuff.
[1951.64 → 1955.64] But it's never actually been public facing because we've just been posting them into
[1955.64 → 1956.64] the forum.
[1956.64 → 1957.64] So that's great.
[1957.64 → 1959.64] Dale the sleeper is live now.
[1959.64 → 1962.64] So that's the sequel to Hubert the sleeper.
[1962.64 → 1964.64] This is a really cool machine, you guys.
[1964.64 → 1966.64] Racer phone is up.
[1966.64 → 1967.64] The...
[1967.64 → 1969.64] Oh, the quad-core blade stealth.
[1969.64 → 1971.64] That video is up.
[1971.64 → 1973.64] Lenovo ThinkPad anniversary edition.
[1973.64 → 1974.64] That's up on float plane.
[1974.64 → 1977.64] And we do have some exclusive content over there as well.
[1977.64 → 1981.64] So this is a pretty cool little look at the guts.
[1981.64 → 1982.64] Did you see this?
[1982.64 → 1983.64] Yes.
[1983.64 → 1984.64] Yeah.
[1984.64 → 1989.64] So this is like kind of the equivalent of a developing kit, a developer kit for automated
[1989.64 → 1990.64] cars.
[1990.64 → 1991.64] Really cool.
[1991.64 → 1992.64] It's really cool stuff.
[1992.64 → 1993.64] I don't recognize almost any of it.
[1993.64 → 1994.64] Yeah.
[1994.64 → 1997.64] But the number of sensors in this thing is freaking bananas.
[1997.64 → 2000.64] So it's just a little three minutes, three minute tour of that.
[2000.64 → 2004.64] I actually think I have another update that's going to go up probably sometime this weekend.
[2004.64 → 2006.64] So should I show them the CMS?
[2006.64 → 2007.64] So another...
[2007.64 → 2010.64] Another cool thing that's working.
[2010.64 → 2013.64] There's no way to set it manually right now.
[2013.64 → 2016.64] But automatic quality changing.
[2016.64 → 2017.64] Yeah.
[2017.64 → 2018.64] Yeah.
[2018.64 → 2019.64] You can definitely show that.
[2019.64 → 2021.64] Automatic quality changing is going to work on the stream, which is really cool.
[2021.64 → 2026.64] AJ has been working on that and a huge amount of other things for quite a while.
[2026.64 → 2027.64] So that's...
[2027.64 → 2029.64] I'm stoked that that's working.
[2029.64 → 2030.64] So, um...
[2030.64 → 2033.64] Oh, someone says they don't see Dale on Flow plane.
[2033.64 → 2034.64] Oh crap.
[2034.64 → 2037.64] I wonder if it's like someone set it to the wrong status.
[2037.64 → 2040.64] So very recently we finished an update.
[2040.64 → 2041.64] Okay.
[2041.64 → 2047.64] Well, what you'll know for sure then having seen that is that it's coming very soon because
[2047.64 → 2048.64] the video is ready.
[2048.64 → 2054.64] We very recently finished an update that allows for like the public private unlisted style
[2054.64 → 2057.64] set up that most video platform sites have.
[2057.64 → 2058.64] Yeah.
[2058.64 → 2060.64] And the people uploading the videos haven't started using it yet.
[2060.64 → 2064.64] So everything's just been public on that site.
[2064.64 → 2066.64] So there you go.
[2066.64 → 2068.64] Got people asking about Justine.
[2068.64 → 2071.64] Um, I definitely have talked to Justine about it.
[2071.64 → 2072.64] Um, I'm...
[2072.64 → 2073.64] Okay, here's the thing.
[2073.64 → 2078.64] I haven't talked to that many people about it just because I haven't had anything to
[2078.64 → 2083.64] show them up until about this week other than like, um, still images.
[2083.64 → 2084.64] And that's not compelling.
[2084.64 → 2085.64] Because you don't wanna...
[2085.64 → 2091.64] It's a weird balance of like, we don't want to do the always in beta thing.
[2091.64 → 2092.64] Yeah.
[2092.64 → 2096.64] But then we've been in production since before we had anything.
[2096.64 → 2097.64] Yeah.
[2097.64 → 2099.64] So we have kind of always been in beta.
[2099.64 → 2100.64] Yeah.
[2100.64 → 2102.64] But then we didn't want to like advertise to other creators before then.
[2102.64 → 2103.64] Yeah.
[2103.64 → 2105.64] And it's a chicken-and-egg thing too because it's hard to...
[2105.64 → 2108.64] You don't want to spend a year working on a platform if you don't have any creators.
[2108.64 → 2111.64] But you don't wanna talk to creators about a platform that doesn't exist.
[2111.64 → 2112.64] You don't want to have.
[2112.64 → 2113.64] That you don't have.
[2113.64 → 2115.64] You don't want to make promises that you can't back up.
[2115.64 → 2119.64] So we've been really cautious and really careful about what we can commit to.
[2119.64 → 2124.64] And, um, you know, we're doing our best to keep from...
[2124.64 → 2126.64] To keep from disappointing anybody.
[2126.64 → 2132.64] I think that's really the main thing for us is we're trying not to screw anything up.
[2132.64 → 2136.64] Um, will float plane allow can girls?
[2136.64 → 2141.64] I'm sure you mean cam girls and, um, no comment at this time.
[2141.64 → 2145.64] One thing I will say about float plane is that we do intend for it to be fairly non-restrictive
[2145.64 → 2149.64] in terms of the kind of content creators that can be there.
[2149.64 → 2150.64] Well, there's also...
[2150.64 → 2151.64] Yeah, there's...
[2151.64 → 2152.64] Nah.
[2152.64 → 2153.64] Should we go into that and go into it slightly?
[2153.64 → 2155.64] I don't think we should go into a ton of detail.
[2155.64 → 2156.64] I mean, this is WAN show.
[2156.64 → 2157.64] We can still do a little bit of tech news.
[2157.64 → 2159.64] We've done like two topics.
[2159.64 → 2161.64] Um, but, uh, it's something that...
[2161.64 → 2168.64] It's extremely unlikely that a conventional cam girl will be on the platform.
[2168.64 → 2173.64] But if there's like an artistic element, we're going to look into that side of things, maybe.
[2173.64 → 2174.64] Yeah.
[2174.64 → 2175.64] So we'll see.
[2175.64 → 2176.64] We're not sure yet.
[2176.64 → 2177.64] We're gonna work with like...
[2177.64 → 2178.64] We're gonna work with creators.
[2178.64 → 2179.64] And like friends of ours.
[2179.64 → 2180.64] Yeah.
[2180.64 → 2184.64] Like that's who we're gonna work with in terms of like what they want this platform to be.
[2184.64 → 2187.64] Because right now we're just building a toolbox.
[2187.64 → 2191.64] And we want people to use it the way that they want to use it.
[2191.64 → 2192.64] My phone's dying.
[2192.64 → 2195.64] Uh, by all the float plane people that I don't know if I can say your name.
[2195.64 → 2196.64] Great work.
[2196.64 → 2197.64] People are like, body paint?
[2197.64 → 2198.64] Very happy to show it.
[2198.64 → 2199.64] That's going to be a gray area.
[2199.64 → 2200.64] See, like, I don't...
[2200.64 → 2201.64] We don't know.
[2201.64 → 2202.64] Um, we're gonna...
[2202.64 → 2204.64] It's going to take talking to people.
[2204.64 → 2205.64] It's going to take planning.
[2205.64 → 2206.64] We're not really focused on that right now.
[2206.64 → 2207.64] Yep.
[2207.64 → 2208.64] Yep.
[2208.64 → 2209.64] Intel CPU...
[2209.64 → 2210.64] Uh, Intel CPU.
[2210.64 → 2211.64] Yeah.
[2211.64 → 2212.64] Intel CEO.
[2212.64 → 2213.64] I'm kind of the CPU.
[2213.64 → 2216.64] Um, we are going to take more risks.
[2216.64 → 2220.64] The original article here is from TechSpot.com.
[2220.64 → 2224.64] Let's go ahead and actually click that and see if that's gonna work for me there.
[2224.64 → 2225.64] Yeah, how's that going?
[2225.64 → 2226.64] Minus the screen.
[2226.64 → 2228.64] We are going to take more risks.
[2228.64 → 2230.64] We are taking the bull by the horns.
[2230.64 → 2232.64] That is some pretty corporate speak right there.
[2232.64 → 2233.64] Yep.
[2233.64 → 2239.64] The article that, um, Brian Kruzanich wrote to the employees, 2017 comes to a close.
[2239.64 → 2241.64] Almost impossible to predict the future.
[2241.64 → 2246.64] One cool thing is that Intel is almost a 50-50 company, which is to say that half the revenue
[2246.64 → 2252.64] comes from the PC and half from new things that they have tried to create.
[2252.64 → 2256.64] It's weird to think of Intel as an underdog, but in a lot of those markets they are.
[2256.64 → 2259.64] You know, you look at Intel and the way they tried to break into phones, for example.
[2259.64 → 2260.64] Yeah.
[2260.64 → 2261.64] What a disaster.
[2261.64 → 2262.64] Yeah.
[2262.64 → 2264.64] That doesn't mean that they're going to stop doing that.
[2264.64 → 2268.64] They're just going to keep trying new things and, uh, see if they can grow that way, apparently.
[2268.64 → 2269.64] So that's good.
[2269.64 → 2271.64] I guess.
[2271.64 → 2275.64] Um, do you wanna talk about the Magic Leap?
[2275.64 → 2277.64] We still don't really know much.
[2277.64 → 2279.64] Yeah, I guess we can go through this pretty quickly.
[2279.64 → 2281.64] Uh, I can talk about it though.
[2281.64 → 2283.64] One, they have an amazing website.
[2283.64 → 2284.64] You should go to their actual native website.
[2284.64 → 2285.64] It's really cool.
[2285.64 → 2286.64] Yeah, it is really cool.
[2286.64 → 2289.64] Hold on, I'm just gonna, I'm going to go to it.
[2289.64 → 2293.64] It's like you scroll down, and it comes out of like a crystal ball or some crazy stuff.
[2293.64 → 2295.64] It's actually worth looking at.
[2295.64 → 2299.64] Um, just because it's like, just really cool.
[2299.64 → 2300.64] Yeah.
[2300.64 → 2301.64] That scroll didn't work as well as it's supposed to.
[2301.64 → 2302.64] There you go, yeah.
[2302.64 → 2303.64] See that?
[2303.64 → 2307.64] So I'm scrolling with my touchpad right now, and it like goes out of this like thing.
[2307.64 → 2308.64] And then you start actually scrolling down the page.
[2308.64 → 2310.64] Then it looks like a normal website.
[2310.64 → 2312.64] So there are a few things that we can see here.
[2312.64 → 2314.64] One is that this is photoshopped.
[2314.64 → 2315.64] Is it?
[2315.64 → 2316.64] That's hilarious.
[2316.64 → 2317.64] That's a render.
[2317.64 → 2318.64] Yeah.
[2318.64 → 2320.64] Yeah, there's absolutely no way.
[2320.64 → 2321.64] Look at this.
[2321.64 → 2322.64] I don't buy it.
[2322.64 → 2323.64] That's hilarious.
[2323.64 → 2324.64] Yeah.
[2324.64 → 2328.64] Like, look, see the light coming off his face on this side and see the way that this
[2328.64 → 2329.64] is lit.
[2329.64 → 2331.64] Like, you can tell they tried.
[2331.64 → 2333.64] But no, I don't buy it.
[2333.64 → 2334.64] Huh.
[2334.64 → 2337.64] Either way, I believe those are translucent lenses.
[2337.64 → 2339.64] They show it somewhere else.
[2339.64 → 2341.64] That's pretty cool.
[2341.64 → 2346.64] And the fact that you can, yeah, so you can see through it, which is super cool.
[2346.64 → 2347.64] Digital light field.
[2347.64 → 2349.64] Um, scroll up a little bit.
[2349.64 → 2350.64] I noticed one thing.
[2350.64 → 2354.64] You know, I've been talking about this, this since the garage.
[2354.64 → 2355.64] Hmm.
[2355.64 → 2360.64] Compute that is untethered from the wall.
[2360.64 → 2361.64] Yeah.
[2361.64 → 2363.64] But is not up on your head.
[2363.64 → 2364.64] Yeah.
[2364.64 → 2365.64] That's really cool.
[2365.64 → 2367.64] Um, that's a way better approach.
[2367.64 → 2372.64] I remember we had joked about doing, um, like a wearable computer where we literally like
[2372.64 → 2376.64] strapped a UPS to the back and like a power supply.
[2376.64 → 2381.64] So you could have like a full desktop experience, but wearing the whole thing as a bodysuit,
[2381.64 → 2383.64] as opposed to putting the whole thing in a backpack.
[2383.64 → 2384.64] Yeah.
[2384.64 → 2387.64] Um, but like, that's actually a very cool idea.
[2387.64 → 2393.64] Having, having untethered, but also tethered, uh, but where it's tethered to you is very cool.
[2393.64 → 2394.64] SDK is coming.
[2394.64 → 2395.64] Interesting.
[2395.64 → 2399.64] I signed up as a, uh, reporter.
[2399.64 → 2400.64] There are different ways that you can sign up.
[2400.64 → 2401.64] Right.
[2401.64 → 2402.64] You can sign up as a developer or whatever else.
[2402.64 → 2403.64] I signed up as a reporter.
[2403.64 → 2404.64] I'm waiting to hear back.
[2404.64 → 2406.64] This is fascinating.
[2406.64 → 2408.64] Open up displays all over the room.
[2408.64 → 2409.64] Yeah.
[2410.64 → 2412.64] Gaming in AR basically.
[2413.64 → 2414.64] Yeah.
[2414.64 → 2418.64] The fact, the fact that you can see through the lenses is very cool because the there isn't
[2418.64 → 2424.64] that many of those that are actually, you can, you can, that you can get that are any good
[2424.64 → 2426.64] and aren't basically just fakes.
[2427.64 → 2429.64] So they're saying they're going to ship in 2018.
[2430.64 → 2431.64] Yeah.
[2431.64 → 2434.64] And you get that controller, which doesn't look like the most gamers controller.
[2434.64 → 2435.64] No, it doesn't.
[2435.64 → 2437.64] It looks like an experiential controller.
[2437.64 → 2438.64] Yeah.
[2438.64 → 2440.64] But that doesn't mean it won't be compatible with other controllers.
[2440.64 → 2441.64] Yeah.
[2441.64 → 2443.64] USB type C looks, this looks like a wireless charging thing.
[2443.64 → 2445.64] Type C on the, uh, that's to compute.
[2446.64 → 2447.64] No, no.
[2447.64 → 2449.64] Oh, oh, is it the whole thing is the compute thing?
[2449.64 → 2450.64] I'm not sure.
[2450.64 → 2452.64] I think that might be wireless charge module on the bottom.
[2452.64 → 2455.64] Cause if not, that's a lot to tuck into a belt or whatever.
[2455.64 → 2457.64] Uh, but that is the compute unit.
[2457.64 → 2459.64] We can run up and have a look at the guy who had it on.
[2459.64 → 2460.64] Yeah.
[2460.64 → 2461.64] I think that's just.
[2461.64 → 2463.64] It looks like it's in his pocket though.
[2463.64 → 2464.64] It doesn't look like it's going through his belt.
[2464.64 → 2467.64] So it could be really bulky on the inside, actually.
[2467.64 → 2471.64] Um, I haven't read the individual things.
[2471.64 → 2472.64] Yeah.
[2472.64 → 2473.64] I think it, I think the bulk does go here.
[2473.64 → 2474.64] Actually, we've got a better look at it here.
[2474.64 → 2475.64] Yeah.
[2475.64 → 2479.64] So you can kind of see that it looks like that big bulky thing does go into his pocket.
[2479.64 → 2480.64] I like that.
[2480.64 → 2481.64] That looks quite robust.
[2481.64 → 2482.64] Yeah.
[2482.64 → 2483.64] Me too.
[2483.64 → 2484.64] Because you can be moving around quite a bit.
[2484.64 → 2486.64] But the thing is, is that if you make it too robust, then it just wears.
[2486.64 → 2487.64] Oh yeah.
[2487.64 → 2488.64] I know.
[2488.64 → 2489.64] Yeah.
[2489.64 → 2490.64] Yeah.
[2490.64 → 2491.64] It looks fairly well done though.
[2491.64 → 2494.64] So yeah, these guys have gotten a lot of funding, including from Intel.
[2494.64 → 2497.64] Speaking of experimental things that Intel's done.
[2497.64 → 2499.64] Um, so it said better than a backpack, I guess.
[2499.64 → 2500.64] I would, I would think so.
[2500.64 → 2501.64] Oh yeah.
[2501.64 → 2505.64] It looks like it's going to be about the same performance scale as the ones that intend
[2505.64 → 2507.64] to have it built into the headset.
[2507.64 → 2512.64] But adding weight to the headset is not in my opinion, the right way to do it.
[2512.64 → 2515.64] And having it so that it can go on in like your pocket or something.
[2515.64 → 2516.64] That sounds cool.
[2516.64 → 2521.64] Well, I've been talking about the compute and storage disk that goes in your pocket for
[2521.64 → 2523.64] the last like four years.
[2523.64 → 2527.64] Um, so I'm, I'm stoked that it's happening in a way.
[2527.64 → 2530.64] Um, blah, blah, blah.
[2530.64 → 2534.64] I may be wrong about Intel having, uh, backed magically Google for sure.
[2534.64 → 2535.64] Alibaba for sure.
[2535.64 → 2539.64] Um, but I, I, I might be, I might've been wrong about that one.
[2539.64 → 2542.64] I thought they were one of the ones that had put some money into it.
[2542.64 → 2545.64] Apparently they've raised about $2 billion so far.
[2545.64 → 2546.64] Jeez.
[2546.64 → 2548.64] And they have shown like basically nothing publicly.
[2548.64 → 2549.64] Yeah.
[2549.64 → 2554.64] Uh, Nvidia ended driver support for 32-bit operating systems.
[2554.64 → 2558.64] So the original article there, this was posted by Matrix 07012 on the forum.
[2558.64 → 2560.64] The original article is from Nvidia.
[2560.64 → 2561.64] Whoops.
[2561.64 → 2562.64] What?
[2562.64 → 2563.64] I don't know what I just did.
[2563.64 → 2564.64] There we go.
[2564.64 → 2565.64] Um, yeah.
[2565.64 → 2567.64] So I get it.
[2567.64 → 2573.64] Like if you bought Windows 10 32 bit, like you really suck at buying windows.
[2573.64 → 2575.64] I literally didn't even know that was a thing.
[2575.64 → 2576.64] Yeah.
[2576.64 → 2577.64] It's pretty dumb.
[2577.64 → 2578.64] Why did they even do that?
[2578.64 → 2579.64] Um, I don't know.
[2579.64 → 2581.64] Compatibility with like really wacko stuff.
[2581.64 → 2582.64] Yeah.
[2582.64 → 2583.64] I guess.
[2583.64 → 2584.64] I would just run the previous OS.
[2584.64 → 2585.64] Durant's NK.
[2585.64 → 2587.64] Uh, yeah, but then you wouldn't get security updates.
[2587.64 → 2589.64] Like Microsoft story has to be got the security updates.
[2589.64 → 2590.64] Yeah.
[2590.64 → 2591.64] Blah, blah, blah.
[2591.64 → 2592.64] Last version of windows.
[2592.64 → 2593.64] Yeah.
[2593.64 → 2594.64] Yeah.
[2594.64 → 2595.64] I got you.
[2595.64 → 2599.64] AMD confirmed second generation Ry zen processors to debut in Q1 2018.
[2599.64 → 2600.64] Cool.
[2600.64 → 2602.64] So they'll be like a little bit better.
[2602.64 → 2604.64] Um, yeah.
[2604.64 → 2605.64] Yeah.
[2605.64 → 2608.64] To be clear, second generation does not mean Zen 2.
[2608.64 → 2612.64] So we can expect tweaks, not, uh, not, not twerks.
[2613.64 → 2614.64] Still cool.
[2614.64 → 2615.64] Yeah.
[2615.64 → 2616.64] Still cool.
[2616.64 → 2617.64] Um, that's exciting.
[2617.64 → 2619.64] It's cool to see them actually continuing to release stuff.
[2619.64 → 2621.64] WE groom AK posted this on the forum.
[2621.64 → 2625.64] Seagate has announced multi actuator technology.
[2625.64 → 2626.64] Yeah.
[2626.64 → 2627.64] Was, was.
[2627.64 → 2632.64] So now, uh, I thought this was a graphic.
[2632.64 → 2633.64] Here we go.
[2633.64 → 2634.64] Yeah, there it goes.
[2634.64 → 2642.64] So now you can actually boost performance by having the read and write heads move to
[2642.64 → 2645.64] different parts of the disc independently.
[2645.64 → 2648.64] So if you need something that's on this platter, this head can go get it.
[2648.64 → 2652.64] And if you need something that's on this platter, this head can go get it, and they don't have
[2652.64 → 2653.64] to wait for each other.
[2653.64 → 2657.64] So this is kind of like SLI for hard drives, but like inside the drive.
[2657.64 → 2658.64] Yeah.
[2660.64 → 2661.64] In the past.
[2661.64 → 2664.64] And like is actually becoming a thing instead of becoming less a thing.
[2664.64 → 2665.64] Yeah.
[2665.64 → 2669.64] So in the past, all of those heads would have had to move, um, in synchronization.
[2669.64 → 2670.64] Yeah.
[2670.64 → 2671.64] Whereas now they can split up.
[2671.64 → 2673.64] Now to be clear, you won't expect to double the performance.
[2673.64 → 2674.64] No.
[2674.64 → 2675.64] Much like SLI.
[2675.64 → 2682.64] Um, but what you will get is potentially much improved, uh, random reads and writes.
[2682.64 → 2688.64] I mean, I'm not going to say that it's, you know, going to get up there with an SSD, but
[2688.64 → 2690.64] it's going to be a lot better.
[2690.64 → 2691.64] I would think.
[2691.64 → 2696.64] And like, if you're in like a torturous situation where hard drives would like really, really,
[2696.64 → 2699.64] really start bottlenecking, then this one should feel it much less.
[2699.64 → 2700.64] Yeah.
[2700.64 → 2702.64] Um, okay.
[2702.64 → 2707.64] There's actually a lot more stuff in here, but like the show is most assuredly over because
[2707.64 → 2710.64] it is a definitely Christmas break and people definitely want to go home.
[2710.64 → 2714.64] And I'm definitely not done shooting Mining Adventure part two over there.
[2714.64 → 2717.64] So, um, that's pretty much it.
[2717.64 → 2719.64] Uh, oh.
[2719.64 → 2721.64] Wait, no, are we good?
[2721.64 → 2722.64] Yeah.
[2722.64 → 2723.64] Yeah, I think so.
[2723.64 → 2725.64] Uh, if you are a Nitwit Ultra subscriber.
[2725.64 → 2726.64] Yeah.
[2726.64 → 2731.64] Um, either myself or Kyle or Linus will post a thing on how to view his live stream.
[2731.64 → 2732.64] Oh yeah.
[2732.64 → 2733.64] Right.
[2733.64 → 2734.64] It's an ultra sub forum.
[2734.64 → 2735.64] Yeah.
[2735.64 → 2736.64] On the actual forum.
[2736.64 → 2737.64] Forum.
[2737.64 → 2738.64] Like not on the float plane site.
[2738.64 → 2741.64] The float plane site is still closed pre-alpha.
[2741.64 → 2742.64] Oh yeah.
[2742.64 → 2746.64] I'm going to have like at least a few hours of support tickets again this weekend explaining
[2746.64 → 2749.64] that that is not the site people are supposed to go to.
[2749.64 → 2752.64] Uh, that happens every time.
[2752.64 → 2758.64] Uh, guys, please do not write Luke a support ticket because then the site development will
[2758.64 → 2759.64] be slower.
[2759.64 → 2762.64] Um, I don't know.
[2762.64 → 2765.64] It probably won't affect it that much.
[2765.64 → 2767.64] That's, I'm trying to scare them.
[2767.64 → 2768.64] Yeah.
[2768.64 → 2769.64] It'll be so.
[2769.64 → 2770.64] Alright, see you again next week.
[2770.64 → 2771.64] Same bat time, same bat channel.
[2771.64 → 2772.64] Why isn't this playing?
[2774.64 → 2776.64] I don't know what's going on here.
[2776.64 → 2777.64] Remember that happened before?
[2777.64 → 2778.64] Right click?
[2778.64 → 2779.64] Yeah.
[2779.64 → 2780.64] Properties?
[2780.64 → 2781.64] Yeah.
[2781.64 → 2782.64] Uh.
[2782.64 → 2783.64] Uh.
[2783.64 → 2784.64] Uh.
[2784.64 → 2785.64] Okay.
[2785.64 → 2786.64] Wow.
[2786.64 → 2787.64] No idea what was that.
[2787.64 → 2789.64] That should have worked, but it did.
[2789.64 → 2790.64] We need the properties.
[2790.64 → 2791.64] Okay.
[2791.64 → 2792.64] Two, three, three, four.
[2792.64 → 2817.52] on the Christmas team I'm on why not both team
[2817.52 → 2827.00] merry Christmas happy holidays um jovial time off whatever doesn't make you unhappy yeah like
[2827.00 → 2837.56] merry PTO that's what Americans call it oh, oh paid time off yeah oh hold on we're still
[2837.56 → 2837.88] streaming
