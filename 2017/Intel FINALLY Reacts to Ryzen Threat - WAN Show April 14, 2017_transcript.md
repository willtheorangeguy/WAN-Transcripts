[0.00 --> 0.34]  Yeah.
[2.58 --> 5.58]  And welcome to the WAN show.
[6.18 --> 10.58]  We have a great, great topic for you guys today.
[10.88 --> 11.24]  Yes.
[11.40 --> 12.40]  And a bunch of crap.
[12.96 --> 14.64]  Oh, we have one great topic.
[14.66 --> 15.68]  Do we have a lot of great topics?
[15.80 --> 18.58]  I haven't looked at the docs, so I have no idea what the topics are today.
[18.74 --> 19.94]  It's going to be a wonderful show.
[20.04 --> 21.46]  It will be a wonderful show.
[21.52 --> 22.60]  I'm looking forward to it.
[22.62 --> 23.24]  We have AMD news.
[23.78 --> 24.22]  Yes.
[24.48 --> 28.46]  Leaked specs for an upcoming AMD graphics card.
[28.46 --> 29.60]  Is it Vega?
[30.86 --> 31.34]  No.
[31.52 --> 32.38]  No, it isn't.
[33.12 --> 34.38]  We have Intel news.
[34.54 --> 34.68]  Yeah.
[34.76 --> 36.80]  We have more AMD news, more Ryzen news.
[37.00 --> 40.04]  I mean, would it be the WAN show without weekly Ryzen news?
[40.22 --> 43.68]  I made that joke in the fake pre-roll thing that I filmed.
[43.90 --> 44.10]  Yeah.
[44.10 --> 47.68]  I mean, like, it's 2017 and it's the WAN show, therefore AMD news.
[47.82 --> 49.26]  And also RGB news.
[49.38 --> 49.56]  Yes.
[49.56 --> 54.74]  Yes, my friends, behind me on my other side, we've got RGB workstations.
[55.42 --> 55.56]  Yes.
[55.56 --> 59.34]  All of our editors are going, they're upgrading for 2017.
[59.34 --> 60.52]  And you know what that means.
[60.52 --> 63.72]  Having more colors in the computer helps with color correction.
[63.84 --> 65.04]  10 core processors.
[65.80 --> 66.72]  Double the memory.
[67.16 --> 68.62]  Better graphics cards.
[69.04 --> 70.14]  DDR4.
[70.76 --> 71.92]  RGB and tempered glass.
[72.44 --> 73.10]  Oh, jeez.
[73.24 --> 74.48]  Tempered glass, my friend.
[74.48 --> 76.70]  What else we got here?
[76.82 --> 78.78]  Oh, Intel rumors too.
[78.88 --> 81.10]  We have rumors from everybody.
[81.86 --> 83.70]  But we'll tell you more about that later.
[83.84 --> 86.76]  First, the pre-recorded intro.
[86.76 --> 88.76]  What?
[94.22 --> 95.04]  Wow, Colton.
[96.32 --> 97.86]  Wow, Colton.
[97.86 --> 97.92]  Wow, Colton.
[98.32 --> 99.98]  Does he even have a job here anymore?
[100.22 --> 100.44]  No.
[100.78 --> 101.42]  Well, not now.
[101.68 --> 102.40]  You just threw that out.
[102.64 --> 103.58]  Yeah, actually.
[103.74 --> 104.14]  You know what?
[104.20 --> 105.48]  Do you want to fire him or should I?
[105.62 --> 106.22]  Colton, you're fired.
[106.70 --> 108.54]  Wow, that's a...
[108.54 --> 110.96]  I mean, you were so quick on the trigger there.
[111.08 --> 117.36]  You couldn't even, like, respond to me that you wanted to be the one to fire him.
[117.40 --> 119.20]  You were just going straight for the fire.
[119.34 --> 120.72]  But I still need you to do stuff.
[120.78 --> 122.24]  So if you could, like, show up on Monday.
[122.46 --> 122.66]  Yeah.
[124.12 --> 125.10]  That'd be great.
[126.50 --> 126.86]  Thanks.
[127.20 --> 128.20]  That'd be swell.
[128.36 --> 129.00]  That'd be really good.
[129.00 --> 131.54]  Um, so yeah, we actually...
[132.18 --> 132.66]  Do you know what?
[132.68 --> 135.82]  There is legitimately a lot of interesting news this week.
[135.88 --> 139.02]  So I guess speaking of people who don't have to be fired, James, as well.
[140.64 --> 141.00]  Yeah!
[141.98 --> 143.20]  Big, big leaks.
[143.20 --> 143.88]  didn't make it in.
[144.10 --> 144.56]  Big leaks.
[145.10 --> 146.66]  Big leaks.
[146.78 --> 147.00]  Oh.
[147.46 --> 148.38]  Big leak leaks.
[148.56 --> 149.26]  Big lee leaks.
[150.28 --> 150.68]  Wow.
[150.90 --> 152.70]  That'd be the most annoying name for a website.
[152.90 --> 155.74]  I'm going to, like, start gleaking if I say that long enough.
[156.62 --> 157.46]  Remember gleaking?
[157.46 --> 160.72]  I remember the kids in my high school that would like they'd run around and be like
[160.72 --> 164.80]  And they'd like so weird and I'm just like wow
[164.80 --> 169.78]  I have spit on me, but you're the one you're the one who should feel gross. Yeah
[169.78 --> 176.38]  AMD Radeon RX 500 series official presentation
[177.46 --> 179.46]  allegedly leaked
[179.46 --> 181.46]  gaming benchmarks and specs allegedly
[181.46 --> 188.98]  Confirmed and the source here is well the article we have is WCCF tech, but I we should just start calling them
[189.80 --> 192.74]  Tech don't you get a kick out of?
[193.46 --> 195.46]  like
[195.56 --> 199.06]  Websites that exist based on leaking confidential
[199.88 --> 204.22]  Information from other websites that are like we better watermark these images
[204.84 --> 210.30]  Yeah, so that other websites don't don't steal this content illegitimately
[210.30 --> 217.96]  Like and the my favorite part to cry me a river is when someone will steal like content like like say
[217.96 --> 221.98]  This was an accidental launch like what happened? I'm not gonna call it the website name
[221.98 --> 226.76]  But what like what happened around the 1080ti sure like where they screw up the time zones
[226.76 --> 229.70]  And they're like oh, and then they pull their own article down
[229.70 --> 235.54]  Yeah, someone else has cached it so they take the images steal those images and then watermark them themselves
[235.54 --> 241.38]  That's how you get yeah, that is how you get
[243.04 --> 247.04]  All right speaking of jacked according to the rumors
[248.12 --> 251.28]  Polaris is it's gonna be called okay?
[251.28 --> 256.10]  I have to make sure that I am only saying things that are in the leak so
[256.70 --> 259.54]  they're calling it Polaris refresh and
[259.54 --> 260.54]  and
[260.54 --> 267.00]  Suggesting that it's gonna be kind of Polaris, but jacked so they're showcasing
[267.60 --> 271.86]  specifications gaming performance and it looks like the series will be
[272.82 --> 274.02]  utilizing a
[274.02 --> 284.58]  Refreshed sort of cooling system our configuration all cards except the Radeon RX 550 will use dual fan cooling solutions as standard
[284.58 --> 293.08]  AMD the the alleged leak of the alleged slides alleges that AMD
[293.86 --> 295.86]  also will be offering higher
[295.86 --> 300.90]  stable operation under load higher frequency stable operation under load with better overclocking and
[301.54 --> 305.20]  That they will allegedly be available on April 18th
[306.20 --> 308.90]  So there you have it
[308.90 --> 315.36]  Now you know what allegedly may or may not be true. So here are some alleged slides
[316.44 --> 321.28]  so this if true for the RX 580 so this would be AMD's
[322.30 --> 325.00]  flagship until Vega because
[326.02 --> 330.18]  as much as I would love to be talking about Vega right now, I'm not you know
[330.84 --> 333.06]  8 gigs of RAM I guess I
[333.06 --> 339.30]  It looks like you are five looks like maybe that would be standard. I'm I'm actually not sure. Oh, no
[341.34 --> 342.34]  Allegedly
[342.34 --> 348.58]  RX 580 will have both 8 and 4 gig variants. Okay, so that's that same as before then so yeah, okay
[349.14 --> 351.14]  and it will outperform
[352.00 --> 356.56]  The R9 380 X which is good I guess
[357.28 --> 359.28]  Where's the zero?
[359.28 --> 362.48]  Don't make when they don't label graphs because like you see you see that like
[362.48 --> 368.24]  No, no, this is here. I think we're good. Yeah, I think we're good. We're good. Yeah, it's 50 versus 69. Yeah. Yeah, that's fair
[368.54 --> 372.06]  69 always wins. Yep. Ah, so here's an RX
[372.56 --> 376.98]  Whatever that's supposed to be Wow. Yeah, great slide. Good job
[376.98 --> 382.58]  You know if you're gonna leak and steal slides you might as well take a better photo. Yeah get on it
[382.58 --> 386.74]  Okay, and take responsibility for your photo quality man
[386.74 --> 389.56]  Here's the thing. How are you expecting not to get caught?
[389.90 --> 393.14]  Like aren't they gonna just like look back and be like who was sitting there?
[393.70 --> 395.14]  Yeah at this time
[395.14 --> 400.08]  Yeah, I was even thinking cuz like you don't want to do phone confiscation at these events cuz that's sketchy
[400.08 --> 404.98]  You never want to give your phone away. Yeah, so maybe they should give like people little boxes
[404.98 --> 410.70]  And they like have to put the phone in the box and it's on like a timed release and it could be like a cool souvenir box
[410.82 --> 413.00]  Yeah, like it could it could like make oh
[413.52 --> 415.52]  It could be a music box
[416.52 --> 418.52]  So no one could open it cuz it'd be like
[427.98 --> 430.44]  Decorative commemorative music
[430.44 --> 433.24]  Music boxes for their events, okay?
[434.32 --> 442.04]  That idea is is when show when show like like copyright, okay?
[442.04 --> 448.14]  Yeah, which means you can use it. Yeah, we just want how much do we ask we usually say 10% we've say 10%
[448.38 --> 454.44]  So we want 10% of the money you'll make on giving away boxes to journalists at events
[454.44 --> 459.26]  Yeah, which isn't to say that we're gonna pay you yeah 10% of the cost
[459.26 --> 462.64]  Yeah, we don't we don't do that part. That's what that sounds like, but that's not what's going on
[462.64 --> 465.08]  Yes, um, so there's a so alright
[465.08 --> 471.28]  So the 570 is apparently much faster than a 370 which is also fortunate cuz it's sort of been a while. Yes
[472.60 --> 479.54]  565 60 is apparently much faster than a 360 and a 750 ti like I
[480.08 --> 483.08]  We both do why are we comparing to the 750 ti?
[483.08 --> 488.90]  I think the reason why they do this where they jump back a couple generations is cuz that's the upgrade cycle
[488.90 --> 491.90]  I get it, but like that's just
[492.90 --> 494.90]  Step into a radiod rx
[496.58 --> 498.58]  How much is this gonna cost?
[500.82 --> 505.02]  4k home theater PC ready, you know that it is not a gaming card
[505.62 --> 509.52]  When they start talking about the home theater and Photoshop
[509.52 --> 515.18]  Oh boy and Photoshop and Adobe Premiere with that said like from my testing
[515.94 --> 517.44]  having just like a
[517.86 --> 519.50]  graphics card is
[519.50 --> 525.12]  Legitimately way better and then stepping up to higher end graphics cards legitimately
[525.66 --> 530.48]  Doesn't make much of a difference my like housemate cell person. Yeah does photo editing stuff
[530.62 --> 532.34]  And like has to have a GPU
[532.34 --> 538.06]  Yeah, not even super important which one it is. Nope just has to have a GPU got to have a GPU
[538.06 --> 544.24]  Yeah, so here they're comparing to Intel HD 530 graphics and the Radeon r7 250 and
[545.26 --> 549.40]  I mean that it's it's not much of a competition so there's that I'm you know
[549.40 --> 553.08]  I'd be wondering if this card so I don't know pricing
[553.08 --> 560.48]  There's no leaked pricing here, but I would be wondering if this card could merit a
[561.58 --> 562.58]  revisiting of
[563.30 --> 565.70]  Low end graphics cards. Do they suck?
[565.70 --> 569.50]  Oh my god, that would actually be kind of cool because we've made okay
[569.50 --> 573.78]  We've made two of these Linus hosted one of them. I hosted another one. We both agree by the way. Yes
[573.78 --> 575.56]  Very much so and they're pointless
[575.56 --> 580.74]  I was just addressing comments on his video to be completely honest and doing it with an a newer card
[580.74 --> 585.16]  That's probably the closest thing to a mean comments video that we've ever done
[586.42 --> 592.98]  Yeah, pretty cool. Yeah, yeah, like addressing mean comments except instead of most people just like reading it and then looking sad at the camera
[592.98 --> 594.98]  We were like get rocks
[597.46 --> 602.68]  Here's why you're wrong and then here are four more reasons why you're wrong. Yeah, also
[603.36 --> 605.36]  Here's me putting them like this
[605.36 --> 610.12]  So yeah, so maybe we do mean comments videos a little bit differently
[610.84 --> 615.32]  All right speaking of mean comments. Yeah, that's actually a pretty good idea
[615.72 --> 621.46]  Yeah, it's probably it's probably worth revisiting if it's any good. Yeah. Yeah, oh see a holic
[622.32 --> 623.44]  has
[623.44 --> 625.44]  Ryzen 5 the 1600x
[627.08 --> 634.26]  Breaking lay records at 5.9 gigahertz on the crosshair six hero motherboard
[634.26 --> 641.54]  This is the same motherboard like people are upset at me for using in our video because whatever
[641.54 --> 647.12]  What people oh people can get upset about anything so there's a CPU at the bottom of a frozen
[648.44 --> 652.28]  Doodad and you know it's extreme overclocking. I know it's called a pot
[653.28 --> 659.30]  It's extreme overclocking so there's like six people watching who are interested and for everyone else we'll move on pretty quickly here
[659.30 --> 660.76]  Don't worry, but
[660.76 --> 667.04]  German overclocker Roman Hartung I mean I'm sure it's pronounced differently than that in German but pushed it to 5.9
[667.66 --> 671.76]  Using some G skill DDR4 memory set to work at DDR4 3000
[672.32 --> 674.32]  cost 12
[674.32 --> 679.10]  Bus speed of a hundred and thirty megahertz liquid nitrogen all cores and threads were enabled and he ran cinebench
[681.84 --> 683.04]  GPU
[683.04 --> 686.94]  Pi GPU pie and geekbench in these four benchmarks
[686.94 --> 692.74]  He achieved global firsts overtaking all Intel hex core processors none of which matters
[693.78 --> 694.78]  because
[694.78 --> 696.78]  you know, it's funny. I think
[697.38 --> 702.50]  Everyone has gone through this maybe I mean you might be about to make me feel stupid, which I wouldn't like
[703.18 --> 706.66]  But I'm gonna put myself out there anyway, because I'm all about putting out
[707.94 --> 709.22]  Okay
[709.22 --> 714.70]  Didn't we did we all go through a time when we first heard of liquid nitrogen?
[715.98 --> 722.46]  Overclocking where we went I'm gonna have a liquid nitrogen cooled computer one day and we start researching it. No I?
[723.50 --> 728.06]  Literally looked at it was like that's really stupid cuz that's gonna be a consumable
[728.84 --> 730.84]  How old were you?
[730.84 --> 731.84]  Not that old
[731.84 --> 735.68]  Maybe grade seven at the max
[735.68 --> 741.28]  So I thought that there might be some way to like
[742.56 --> 749.96]  use it like phase change it and like I don't know maybe you would pressurize it back down into a liquid and then you would
[750.06 --> 754.80]  Okay, something something I okay, so maybe but then at that point my brain would have gone
[755.38 --> 762.84]  Way too expensive and I would never do that. Yeah, so anyway and like super volatile and anyway liquid nitrogen is irrelevant
[762.84 --> 771.42]  The most you can do for actual 24 7 operation and even this is not practical is phase change so we're talking like
[772.96 --> 774.96]  minus
[774.96 --> 783.08]  40 or so and it's like really loud and really it's obnoxious and it's bulky and it's basically like this guy
[785.22 --> 787.22]  This guy into your computer room
[788.08 --> 789.52]  maybe
[789.52 --> 794.64]  Maybe they would how's it going? I'd like to check out your computer room. May I enter?
[796.36 --> 798.94]  Straw poll 99% yes one troll
[801.22 --> 803.22]  That sounds very much like the old
[803.22 --> 804.22]  LTT intro
[804.22 --> 806.22]  Yeah, it's not that far off
[806.26 --> 808.26]  the porn intro
[808.36 --> 810.36]  Terrible
[810.36 --> 815.46]  What else do we have today? I mean do we do we even have topics? Oh, yeah, actually this is pretty cool
[815.98 --> 817.56]  so
[817.56 --> 825.10]  the rumors that were circulating that Intel was slashing prices on their CPUs in
[825.60 --> 829.04]  advance of AMD's Ryzen 7 launch those turned out to be
[829.56 --> 833.54]  more to do with micro center being micro center and
[834.48 --> 838.70]  selling Intel processors at a loss for no apparent reason I
[838.70 --> 843.82]  I nor anyone outside of micro center seems to have been able to
[843.82 --> 848.08]  been able to crack the the mystery as to how they're able to sell
[848.08 --> 853.54]  CPUs at like 50 plus dollars below cost and still be in business all these years later
[853.54 --> 854.54]  um
[854.54 --> 856.32]  but
[856.32 --> 863.86]  if you thought for a second that Intel wasn't going to respond in any way
[863.86 --> 872.96]  then you were definitely wrong or at least rumoredly wrong we actually don't have confirmation on this one way or the other so I can kind of say whatever I want right now
[873.60 --> 877.18]  Intel's Skylake X so this is from techspot.com and
[877.58 --> 884.90]  Kaby Lake X processors rumored to arrive earlier than initially anticipated so this is a clear
[884.90 --> 894.52]  direct response to Ryzen 7 because both Skylake X and Kaby Lake X are the
[894.52 --> 896.44]  lagging behind
[896.44 --> 912.56]  um sort of enterprise Xeon version that then gets adapted into this this middle ground so at the entry level you've got 11 5 X 11 56 11 55 11 50 11 51 is that all of them
[912.56 --> 918.06]  Can they just change the socket count the pin count to something other than 11 5 something?
[918.06 --> 922.14]  Yes, it's rather annoying at this point. I feel like they're just toying with me
[922.14 --> 924.46]  They're just trying to make it hard to remember
[924.46 --> 928.76]  So that's at the low end and the mid range and sort of the
[928.76 --> 930.48]  5-5-1-5-5-5-6
[930.48 --> 931.18]  I think you got it
[931.18 --> 932.68]  Okay, awesome
[932.68 --> 933.74]  So
[933.74 --> 935.38]  There's that
[935.38 --> 937.98]  Then at the very high end there's your LGA
[937.98 --> 938.64]  2011
[938.64 --> 940.94]  3 or 2011 and
[940.94 --> 941.90]  previously
[941.90 --> 943.86]  1366 and I think there was
[943.86 --> 946.16]  There was actually 25 something? Can't remember
[946.16 --> 947.98]  There's a different one
[947.98 --> 948.66]  There's like a
[948.66 --> 950.36]  And there's like Knight's Landing and stuff
[950.36 --> 952.08]  I forgot how many pins that bloody thing has
[952.08 --> 952.62]  It's huge
[952.62 --> 953.04]  Yeah
[953.04 --> 953.50]  Anyway
[953.50 --> 954.00]  So
[954.00 --> 956.32]  So that's your server right there
[956.32 --> 959.96]  Then they take those same server architecture
[959.96 --> 967.84]  Chips those same those same designs and they kind of trickle them down into the the prosumer workstation
[967.84 --> 969.16]  like professional
[969.16 --> 974.12]  Ish and also very very high-end enthusiast and that's going to be
[974.12 --> 981.08]  Your 2011 3 based on your x99 chipset or like your x something 99 chipset
[981.08 --> 987.38]  So what's happened is that for the last I don't know how long has it been five years
[987.38 --> 989.68]  Ever since I think Linfield
[989.68 --> 995.92]  So Linfield launched after Bloomfield if I recall correctly
[995.92 --> 996.90]  I feel like it's been long
[996.90 --> 1002.38]  So the enthusiast platform got the high-end back in the 1366 days
[1002.38 --> 1004.06]  So this was um
[1004.06 --> 1007.04]  Yeah got the high-end first I believe
[1007.04 --> 1008.24]  And then Linfield
[1008.24 --> 1010.28]  1156 came later
[1010.28 --> 1011.80]  You thought it was five years since Linfield?
[1012.22 --> 1013.08]  Yeah when was Linfield?
[1013.24 --> 1013.58]  Eight
[1013.58 --> 1014.72]  Oh crap
[1014.72 --> 1017.12]  Why am I so old?
[1017.50 --> 1019.54]  Okay but Linfield came after Bloomfield right?
[1020.42 --> 1021.36]  I think so
[1021.36 --> 1023.50]  Anyway so I'm going to tell the story my way regardless
[1023.50 --> 1028.82]  So then what happened after that was we went from the enthusiast platform
[1028.82 --> 1033.66]  Getting the new architecture first because Linfield was basically Bloomfield but like crappier
[1033.66 --> 1036.66]  Um because it was like dual cores and stuff
[1036.66 --> 1040.34]  And then we went from well okay they did have a quad core
[1040.34 --> 1042.04]  Okay look the point is don't stress about it
[1042.04 --> 1045.82]  We went from the enthusiast getting the update first
[1045.82 --> 1048.00]  And then the mainstream getting it
[1048.00 --> 1051.12]  To the mainstream getting the new architecture first
[1051.12 --> 1056.24]  And then enthusiast getting it later because we were waiting for the enterprise to adopt it
[1056.24 --> 1061.10]  And then we were waiting for that to trickle down to the high-end
[1061.10 --> 1063.94]  And like the workstation and the enthusiast market
[1063.94 --> 1065.24]  So was it right? Did I have it?
[1065.62 --> 1066.04]  Uh yeah
[1066.04 --> 1066.74]  Okay good
[1066.74 --> 1069.48]  Also there was 5,000 people sitting on the Twitch
[1069.48 --> 1072.02]  From that uh little thing we did
[1072.02 --> 1072.46]  But anyways
[1072.46 --> 1076.76]  Um so sorry to all of those people who are there
[1076.76 --> 1079.74]  And we are um recording this actually the next day
[1079.74 --> 1080.84]  Um
[1080.84 --> 1083.32]  So
[1083.32 --> 1086.70]  Anyway so what so what happened then
[1086.70 --> 1088.40]  Was you would get
[1088.40 --> 1090.38]  Mainstream processors
[1090.38 --> 1092.52]  That benefited from the
[1092.52 --> 1094.84]  Even if it's just 5 or 10%
[1094.84 --> 1096.78]  Improvement in IPC
[1096.78 --> 1098.16]  You'd get mainstream processors
[1098.16 --> 1100.86]  That seriously outperformed
[1100.86 --> 1103.34]  Much more expensive ones
[1103.34 --> 1105.52]  That were supposedly workstation
[1105.52 --> 1107.34]  Or that were enthusiast class
[1107.34 --> 1110.26]  And that has remained true
[1110.26 --> 1112.14]  Basically since that time
[1112.14 --> 1113.38]  So
[1113.38 --> 1115.90]  What this article means
[1115.90 --> 1116.52]  Finally
[1116.52 --> 1117.58]  Full circle
[1117.58 --> 1118.82]  Back to this article
[1118.82 --> 1120.94]  Where the rumor is
[1120.94 --> 1122.10]  That both
[1122.10 --> 1123.18]  Skylake X
[1123.18 --> 1125.90]  So that's the bigger Skylake with more course
[1125.90 --> 1127.30]  And Kaby Lake X
[1127.30 --> 1131.30]  The fact that both of these are apparently on an accelerated timetable
[1131.30 --> 1133.40]  Means that it looks like
[1133.40 --> 1134.84]  Intel is trying to
[1134.84 --> 1136.12]  Kind of get caught up
[1136.12 --> 1138.80]  So they're not fighting Ryzen 7
[1138.80 --> 1139.84]  With
[1139.84 --> 1142.04]  Not even current
[1142.04 --> 1143.50]  Generation chips
[1143.50 --> 1145.78]  Because the normal cadence
[1145.78 --> 1146.88]  Would have
[1146.88 --> 1148.12]  Intel launching
[1148.12 --> 1148.92]  A
[1148.92 --> 1151.42]  A follow up to Kaby Lake
[1151.42 --> 1153.34]  In June at Computex
[1153.34 --> 1155.06]  And then launching
[1155.06 --> 1155.88]  What would
[1155.88 --> 1157.88]  Finally then be
[1157.88 --> 1160.08]  Skylake E
[1160.08 --> 1161.24]  Months later
[1161.24 --> 1163.00]  Around the PAX time frame
[1163.00 --> 1163.98]  No no
[1163.98 --> 1164.94]  Which is super weird
[1164.94 --> 1165.90]  So now
[1165.90 --> 1167.38]  Skylake X
[1167.38 --> 1168.28]  Is
[1168.28 --> 1169.24]  Moving up
[1169.24 --> 1170.62]  From sometime in Q3
[1170.62 --> 1171.30]  To
[1171.30 --> 1171.88]  June
[1171.88 --> 1173.96]  So that's around Computex time frame
[1173.96 --> 1175.44]  And will apparently include
[1175.44 --> 1177.58]  6 and 10 core CPUs
[1177.58 --> 1178.34]  Support for
[1178.34 --> 1179.00]  Quad channel
[1179.00 --> 1179.70]  DDR4
[1179.70 --> 1180.86]  2667
[1180.86 --> 1182.54]  Memory
[1182.54 --> 1183.30]  And
[1183.30 --> 1184.44]  44
[1184.44 --> 1185.78]  PCI
[1185.78 --> 1186.86]  E lanes
[1186.86 --> 1191.78]  I am a little confused
[1191.78 --> 1192.72]  About
[1192.72 --> 1194.08]  The
[1194.08 --> 1194.88]  What
[1194.88 --> 1195.66]  This
[1195.66 --> 1196.64]  Particular
[1196.64 --> 1197.96]  Hold on a second
[1197.96 --> 1199.84]  So we're gonna get an
[1199.84 --> 1200.98]  X299
[1200.98 --> 1201.76]  Chipset
[1201.76 --> 1202.72]  To accompany that
[1202.72 --> 1203.30]  Apparently
[1203.30 --> 1204.66]  And
[1204.66 --> 1205.70]  I don't
[1205.70 --> 1206.44]  Understand
[1206.44 --> 1208.76]  What part
[1208.76 --> 1209.44]  What
[1209.44 --> 1210.70]  What these
[1210.70 --> 1211.44]  Kaby Lake
[1211.44 --> 1211.84]  X
[1211.84 --> 1212.28]  Notes
[1212.28 --> 1213.58]  Mean
[1213.58 --> 1214.82]  So a
[1214.82 --> 1216.12]  Kaby Lake
[1216.12 --> 1217.48]  X
[1217.48 --> 1218.44]  Apparently
[1218.44 --> 1219.32]  Is
[1219.32 --> 1221.58]  Also
[1221.58 --> 1222.78]  Going to be
[1222.78 --> 1223.74]  On the
[1223.74 --> 1224.74]  2066
[1224.74 --> 1225.50]  Socket
[1225.50 --> 1227.24]  But with just
[1227.24 --> 1228.00]  4 cores
[1228.00 --> 1228.72]  Dual channel
[1228.72 --> 1229.08]  Memory
[1229.08 --> 1229.84]  And far
[1229.84 --> 1230.22]  Fewer
[1230.22 --> 1230.82]  PCI
[1230.82 --> 1231.36]  E lanes
[1231.36 --> 1231.74]  Well then
[1231.74 --> 1232.18]  Why would
[1232.18 --> 1232.62]  You put it
[1232.62 --> 1233.08]  On that
[1233.08 --> 1233.52]  Socket
[1233.52 --> 1234.00]  Instead of
[1234.00 --> 1234.48]  Just putting
[1234.48 --> 1234.76]  It on
[1234.76 --> 1234.88]  An
[1234.88 --> 1235.18]  11
[1235.18 --> 1236.12]  51
[1236.12 --> 1238.74]  Right now
[1238.74 --> 1239.52]  More like
[1239.52 --> 1239.88]  A normal
[1239.88 --> 1240.18]  Person
[1240.18 --> 1241.16]  If you
[1241.16 --> 1241.86]  Want a
[1241.86 --> 1242.48]  Box
[1242.48 --> 1243.12]  With huge
[1243.12 --> 1243.40]  Amounts
[1243.40 --> 1243.80]  Of RAM
[1243.80 --> 1244.04]  And don't
[1244.04 --> 1244.42]  Actually care
[1244.42 --> 1244.90]  About compute
[1244.90 --> 1245.10]  Speed
[1245.10 --> 1245.32]  Yeah but
[1245.32 --> 1245.52]  If you
[1245.52 --> 1245.94]  Only have
[1245.94 --> 1246.52]  Two channels
[1246.52 --> 1246.84]  You wouldn't
[1246.84 --> 1247.06]  Be able
[1247.06 --> 1247.46]  To do
[1247.46 --> 1247.86]  That
[1247.86 --> 1249.08]  Oh is
[1249.08 --> 1249.16]  It
[1249.16 --> 1249.38]  Actually
[1249.38 --> 1250.42]  So what
[1250.42 --> 1250.70]  Does this
[1250.70 --> 1251.02]  Even
[1251.02 --> 1251.54]  What does
[1251.54 --> 1251.94]  This even
[1251.94 --> 1252.52]  Mean
[1252.52 --> 1254.70]  Two channels
[1254.70 --> 1256.12]  Yeah
[1256.12 --> 1256.74]  Huh
[1256.74 --> 1257.46]  This is like
[1257.46 --> 1259.14]  The only benefit
[1259.14 --> 1259.68]  Of the higher
[1259.68 --> 1260.22]  End platform
[1260.22 --> 1261.06]  Is more
[1261.06 --> 1261.56]  Cores
[1261.56 --> 1262.50]  More
[1262.50 --> 1262.98]  PCI
[1262.98 --> 1263.40]  E lanes
[1263.40 --> 1263.94]  And
[1263.94 --> 1264.70]  More memory
[1264.70 --> 1265.16]  Channels
[1265.16 --> 1265.88]  So if you
[1265.88 --> 1266.14]  Took all
[1266.14 --> 1266.54]  That stuff
[1266.54 --> 1267.04]  Off
[1267.04 --> 1268.30]  Then
[1268.30 --> 1269.40]  You'd
[1269.40 --> 1269.80]  Be dumb
[1269.80 --> 1272.14]  Um
[1272.14 --> 1272.52]  Well
[1272.52 --> 1272.84]  I don't
[1272.84 --> 1273.06]  Know
[1273.06 --> 1273.48]  It's a
[1273.48 --> 1273.82]  Rumor
[1273.82 --> 1274.80]  So the
[1274.80 --> 1275.18]  Fact that
[1275.18 --> 1275.52]  It makes
[1275.52 --> 1276.24]  No sense
[1276.24 --> 1277.08]  Whatsoever
[1277.08 --> 1278.32]  Um
[1278.32 --> 1278.84]  Might be
[1278.84 --> 1279.14]  Fine
[1279.14 --> 1279.56]  Might be
[1279.56 --> 1279.92]  Fine
[1279.92 --> 1280.60]  And
[1280.60 --> 1281.54]  Apparently
[1281.54 --> 1281.86]  They'll
[1281.86 --> 1282.42]  Lack an
[1282.42 --> 1282.88]  Integrated
[1282.88 --> 1283.38]  GPU
[1283.38 --> 1284.06]  So that's
[1284.06 --> 1284.36]  One
[1284.36 --> 1284.82]  Difference
[1284.82 --> 1286.40]  But uh
[1286.40 --> 1286.94]  Stay tuned
[1286.94 --> 1288.54]  So there's
[1288.54 --> 1288.80]  That
[1288.80 --> 1290.48]  Okay so
[1290.48 --> 1290.96]  Here's another
[1290.96 --> 1291.36]  Rumor
[1291.36 --> 1291.68]  Yeah
[1291.68 --> 1292.18]  This one
[1292.18 --> 1292.42]  I hadn't
[1292.42 --> 1292.62]  Even
[1292.62 --> 1293.06]  Heard of

[1300.14 --> 1300.56]  Is from

[1304.86 --> 1305.20]  Isn't that
[1305.20 --> 1305.66]  What rappers
[1305.66 --> 1305.86]  Do

[1306.90 --> 1308.08]  Yeah

[1486.44 --> 1486.92]  Group
[1486.92 --> 1488.52]  It's
[1488.52 --> 1488.80]  Probably
[1488.80 --> 1489.14]  Fine
[1489.14 --> 1489.78]  Graphics
[1489.78 --> 1490.20]  I
[1490.20 --> 1490.52]  Think
[1490.52 --> 1490.78]  That
[1490.78 --> 1491.06]  Might
[1491.06 --> 1491.20]  Be
[1491.20 --> 1491.42]  Quite
[1491.42 --> 1491.50]  A
[1491.50 --> 1491.60]  Bit
[1491.60 --> 1491.76]  More
[1491.76 --> 1492.18]  Palatable
[1492.18 --> 1492.68]  Yeah
[1492.68 --> 1493.62]  And
[1493.62 --> 1493.80]  Then
[1493.80 --> 1494.16]  Radeon
[1494.16 --> 1494.58]  Technology
[1494.58 --> 1494.84]  Group
[1494.84 --> 1495.26]  Graphics
[1495.26 --> 1495.42]  Which
[1495.42 --> 1495.56]  Is
[1495.56 --> 1495.94]  Also
[1495.94 --> 1496.30]  Work
[1496.30 --> 1496.54]  With
[1496.54 --> 1497.00]  AMD
[1497.00 --> 1497.58]  That's
[1497.58 --> 1497.78]  Right
[1497.78 --> 1498.06]  Which
[1498.06 --> 1498.18]  Is
[1498.18 --> 1498.44]  Fine
[1498.44 --> 1498.90]  Which
[1498.90 --> 1499.04]  Is
[1499.04 --> 1499.28]  Fine
[1499.28 --> 1499.66]  Yeah
[1499.66 --> 1500.06]  And
[1500.06 --> 1500.14]  It
[1500.14 --> 1500.26]  Could
[1500.26 --> 1500.40]  Be
[1500.40 --> 1500.60]  Owned
[1500.60 --> 1500.76]  By
[1500.76 --> 1501.06]  AMD
[1501.06 --> 1501.32]  But
[1501.32 --> 1501.74]  There's
[1501.74 --> 1502.22]  There's
[1502.22 --> 1502.38]  So
[1502.38 --> 1502.62]  Much
[1502.62 --> 1502.76]  Of
[1507.60 --> 1508.20]  Toyota

[1510.88 --> 1511.46]  But
[1511.46 --> 1511.64]  That
[1511.64 --> 1511.92]  Doesn't
[1511.92 --> 1512.32]  Change
[1512.32 --> 1512.56]  That
[1512.56 --> 1512.86]  There's
[1512.86 --> 1513.00]  A
[1513.00 --> 1513.44]  Consumer
[1513.44 --> 1514.04]  Perception
[1514.04 --> 1514.70]  And

[1515.86 --> 1516.06]  Have

[1518.64 --> 1519.22]  Perception
[1519.22 --> 1519.68]  That's

[1522.12 --> 1522.58]  AMD
[1522.58 --> 1523.16]  Right
[1523.16 --> 1524.84]  Interesting
[1524.84 --> 1525.40]  Yeah
[1525.40 --> 1526.32]  So
[1526.32 --> 1526.54]  Anyway
[1526.54 --> 1526.78]  Back
[1526.78 --> 1526.92]  To

[1527.86 --> 1529.40]  I'm
[1529.40 --> 1529.88]  Planning
[1529.88 --> 1530.32]  To

[1535.88 --> 1536.96]  That's
[1536.96 --> 1537.20]  Worth
[1537.20 --> 1537.38]  Their

[1539.34 --> 1540.24]  Right
[1540.24 --> 1541.34]  Rude
[1541.34 --> 1543.02]  Yes
[1543.02 --> 1544.06]  It
[1544.06 --> 1544.66]  Goes
[1544.66 --> 1544.92]  Back
[1544.92 --> 1545.04]  And
[1545.04 --> 1545.22]  Forth
[1545.22 --> 1545.34]  A
[1545.34 --> 1545.46]  Little

[1547.54 --> 1547.72]  Do
[1547.72 --> 1548.02]  Yep
[1548.02 --> 1548.48]  Because
[1548.48 --> 1549.04]  It's
[1549.04 --> 1549.32]  Just
[1549.32 --> 1549.76]  It's
[1549.76 --> 1549.94]  More
[1549.94 --> 1550.42]  Flexible

[1550.94 --> 1551.04]  Of
[1551.04 --> 1551.38]  Ways
[1551.38 --> 1552.06]  Yes
[1552.06 --> 1552.18]  It
[1552.18 --> 1552.56]  Increases
[1552.56 --> 1553.04]  Cost
[1553.04 --> 1553.22]  But
[1553.22 --> 1553.34]  By

[1599.86 --> 1600.64]  But
[1600.64 --> 1601.44]  It's
[1601.44 --> 1602.24]  It's

[1761.08 --> 1761.30]  See
[1761.30 --> 1761.50]  That

[2088.64 --> 2088.80]  Don't
[2088.80 --> 2088.98]  Think
