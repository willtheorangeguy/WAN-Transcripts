[0.00 → 0.54] Really even.
[1.74 → 2.00] Boom.
[2.26 → 3.24] Wow, how early are we?
[3.56 → 4.16] One minute?
[4.88 → 5.52] 40 seconds.
[5.70 → 9.68] Yeah, I was going to say, to be fair, not a full minute, but we are early.
[9.80 → 15.12] Welcome to the WAN show of the 28th of April 2017.
[15.50 → 17.70] Yeah, we have some really cool topics.
[18.06 → 22.80] One of them being that Acer has announced their most badass gaming monitor yet, which is pretty sick.
[22.90 → 29.10] The FCC announces a plan to reverse Title II of net neutrality, which I don't personally know a ton about,
[29.10 → 31.70] because I'm a Canadian, we were like, no to that.
[32.16 → 35.10] But John will have much better insights on that topic.
[35.98 → 38.04] Amazon's Alex.
[38.86 → 39.66] With an A.
[40.96 → 43.08] Learns to talk like a human, which is cool.
[43.42 → 50.16] Elon Musk at a TEDx conference in Vancouver teases a little bit of the Tesla electric semi-truck,
[50.26 → 54.40] which is pretty cool, and four new Gigafactory locations, which is pretty ridiculous.
[55.98 → 58.38] And, yeah, there was one more thing.
[58.38 → 59.24] Oh, my God.
[59.44 → 62.82] I keep on double-clicking with my touchpad, and I'm a super noob.
[63.08 → 68.24] Nintendo is launching a new 2DS XL, which is like floppy and stuff,
[68.36 → 71.08] which is what the 3DS probably should have been this whole time,
[71.12 → 74.40] so it could have been cheaper, and that 3D option would have just never been there,
[74.48 → 76.08] which would have been completely fine.
[76.82 → 78.00] And that's the show this week.
[78.08 → 78.34] Intro.
[78.60 → 79.30] Roll the intro.
[80.58 → 81.62] Look at it work.
[82.12 → 82.74] Look at that.
[82.74 → 86.22] Don't you like that when you just press a button and something just happens?
[86.50 → 87.18] It's so fantastic.
[88.88 → 89.20] Ooh.
[90.28 → 90.88] The mansion.
[91.28 → 92.10] Weekly analysis.
[92.60 → 93.04] Sometimes.
[93.80 → 93.88] Sometimes.
[94.88 → 96.44] Sometimes we just talk real weird stuff.
[96.60 → 98.22] I can always take a look at how many people go,
[98.26 → 99.76] oh, my God, Mike's not muted, by the way.
[99.82 → 100.20] I'm like, yeah.
[100.60 → 101.40] Spectrum glasses.
[101.40 → 104.94] Cooler Master.
[106.80 → 109.08] And move that back up there and go back.
[109.42 → 109.70] All right.
[110.26 → 112.46] So, first things first, that crazy monitor.
[112.60 → 113.58] Let's get up to the top here.
[113.60 → 114.02] Let's do it.
[114.78 → 116.24] Acer's new gaming monitor.
[116.54 → 119.86] The notes in the docs say that it is 44 hertz,
[119.86 → 125.74] but my extremely techie brain was like, there's no way that's accurate.
[125.94 → 126.78] Thanks a lot, James.
[126.98 → 127.22] Yeah.
[127.22 → 131.42] So, it's 144 hertz HDR 4K UHD monitor.
[131.92 → 132.70] Super badass.
[132.80 → 133.84] Want to keep talking about it?
[134.06 → 134.34] Yeah.
[135.28 → 140.44] Basically what Luke said, being billed as the nicest Acer gaming monitor
[140.44 → 141.96] that Acer has ever made.
[142.48 → 143.08] There we go.
[143.12 → 145.74] It has local dimming for better contrast,
[145.74 → 147.38] which is actually pretty cool.
[147.78 → 147.84] Yeah.
[148.02 → 151.76] So, that's part of the HDR bit where there's all the different zones,
[152.02 → 155.18] and it can, like, turn off different zones to get better darkness and contrast.
[155.44 → 155.60] Yeah.
[155.70 → 156.10] Super cool.
[156.10 → 158.38] One of the better solutions to get better contrast.
[159.24 → 161.24] Four milliseconds of response time.
[161.74 → 164.02] It doesn't say what kind of panel it is,
[164.06 → 166.88] but I believe it will be, with four milliseconds, it will be an IPS.
[167.26 → 169.00] So, like, a little bit quicker IPS.
[169.22 → 171.10] And should look fairly nice, which is cool.
[171.30 → 171.52] Mm-hmm.
[173.16 → 175.80] Also has HDMI 2.0.
[175.80 → 180.68] I don't know if HDMI 2.1 has made this way onto any consumer devices yet,
[180.76 → 183.60] but if you want to run 4K at 60 hertz on this monitor,
[183.72 → 185.38] you can do it through HDMI 2.0.
[186.90 → 188.14] You probably shouldn't, though.
[188.18 → 189.70] It's a 144 hertz monitor.
[189.86 → 192.88] You're going to want to run at 144 hertz.
[192.88 → 196.80] So, yeah, maybe if your graphics hardware is linear powered, but, you know.
[196.80 → 197.02] Yeah.
[197.20 → 197.46] Yeah.
[197.52 → 197.92] I don't know.
[197.92 → 203.58] If you want to, like, for some reason have multiple inputs plugged in at once.
[203.68 → 203.94] Yes.
[203.94 → 208.28] And you want to run something that doesn't need the 4K 144 hertz,
[208.50 → 210.18] you can totally do that, which is cool.
[210.98 → 215.36] Like, right now, if you had, say, this thing, the analog NT,
[215.52 → 217.16] which you guys can't see, but it's right off camera,
[217.48 → 220.44] you wanted to have that plugged in and your computer, you could totally do that.
[220.58 → 220.70] Yep.
[220.84 → 223.52] And it also has Tobin eye tracking built in.
[223.76 → 224.02] Okay.
[224.14 → 225.40] So, if you can scroll back up a little bit there,
[225.44 → 229.24] if you're wondering what that kind of bar on the bottom there is,
[229.32 → 230.26] that is what that would be.
[230.32 → 230.92] It is an eye tracker.
[230.92 → 232.06] So, you've got that.
[232.60 → 232.92] Mm-hmm.
[232.92 → 235.74] And Tobin's been an interesting technology to follow,
[235.84 → 240.22] because I tried them out at a CES, like, quite a few years ago,
[240.78 → 243.88] and, like, admittedly, it was not very good.
[244.24 → 245.88] It was pretty bad.
[245.92 → 248.34] It was a little bit of a work in progress, and I saw it as well.
[248.46 → 248.84] Yeah.
[249.08 → 250.70] But it's kind of been a while.
[251.18 → 254.86] I know Seeds if you guys know Seeds, the big streamer,
[255.04 → 257.76] he has it permanently mounted on the bottom of his monitor,
[257.76 → 260.00] and he's done some streams where he used it,
[260.06 → 261.20] and he says that it was pretty cool.
[261.20 → 264.58] And I had him try it in front of me, because I was like, oh, BS.
[265.08 → 268.54] And it worked well for him, so I'm assuming that it's gotten better over time,
[268.58 → 269.02] which is cool.
[269.48 → 272.88] I also want to say a couple more words about that local dimming this monitor has.
[272.88 → 278.10] So apparently it's 384 different backlighting zones.
[278.10 → 278.32] Yeah.
[278.54 → 284.78] So the amount of control the monitor can exert over one tiny little section is actually pretty high.
[284.78 → 293.20] But you do need a 10-series NVIDIA graphics card, so a 1080 or a 1070, something like that,
[293.44 → 295.34] with a DisplayPort 1.4 connector.
[295.62 → 297.42] But that should not be very difficult to find.
[297.48 → 298.38] That's the modern standard.
[298.72 → 298.94] Yeah.
[299.16 → 299.28] Yeah.
[299.52 → 299.70] Yeah.
[300.08 → 303.48] That's one thing about HDR, with all the individually controllable...
[303.48 → 304.02] What the heck?
[305.72 → 307.30] Is it like an accessory for it?
[307.30 → 307.76] Is there a hood on it?
[307.80 → 308.38] Let's see.
[308.56 → 309.02] Let's see.
[309.66 → 310.06] Yeah.
[310.06 → 310.46] Wow.
[310.46 → 310.70] What?
[310.70 → 310.74] Yeah.
[310.74 → 311.20] That's what it looks like.
[311.20 → 312.78] So I wonder if that comes with it.
[312.84 → 313.44] Let's see here.
[314.62 → 316.20] I didn't notice anything about that.
[316.32 → 316.88] I didn't either.
[316.88 → 322.38] But if you guys can see this on screen, there's like on a camera sometimes,
[322.48 → 323.88] where I'm going to use totally the wrong term.
[323.96 → 325.40] I'm sorry, Brandon, if you can hear this.
[325.62 → 329.64] But on a camera sometimes, there's like those things that come out past the lens
[329.64 → 333.06] to block certain light out from getting in the lens that you don't want.
[333.34 → 335.18] And it's kind of like the same deal, but for the monitor.
[335.30 → 337.78] There's a hood on the top, and there are two side panels.
[337.84 → 338.96] Sort of like horse blinders.
[338.96 → 342.10] Yeah, so if you're not in like an optimum environment,
[342.32 → 343.98] and you have glare or whatever else.
[344.02 → 346.98] And you're like, this is an HD monitor with a bunch of
[346.98 → 348.60] individually controllable lighting zones.
[349.10 → 350.00] It needs to look perfect.
[350.52 → 352.62] You know if you're going to sink that much money into it,
[352.68 → 354.08] I can actually understand the attitude.
[354.32 → 358.60] And speaking of which, no pricing or release information on this yet,
[358.70 → 360.02] but hopefully soon.
[360.24 → 361.72] I'm really interested in the hood.
[362.10 → 364.74] I want to get it in here and try to see if it actually really does anything.
[364.74 → 366.12] You're really interested in the hood, Luke?
[366.22 → 366.38] Yeah.
[366.38 → 369.36] You know, I get that impression from you just all the time.
[369.44 → 369.60] Yeah.
[369.60 → 371.64] You know, listening to your rap at your desk.
[371.66 → 372.38] Super gangster.
[372.62 → 372.88] Super.
[373.58 → 373.84] Yeah.
[374.10 → 375.92] Anyway, I thought that was pretty cool.
[376.78 → 379.34] It's fun to see Acer pushing more in the monitor segment.
[379.52 → 381.56] Wow, someone just made a big change to the dock.
[381.70 → 382.00] Thanks.
[382.00 → 383.58] Oh, what is happening?
[383.78 → 385.76] Oh, it looks like just to the table of contents.
[385.92 → 388.38] Okay, so this is very much more you, John.
[388.38 → 389.36] It is very much more me.
[389.36 → 393.60] But the FCC announced this plan to reverse Title II net neutrality.
[394.66 → 398.28] I know most of what those words mean.
[398.82 → 399.16] Okay.
[399.38 → 400.40] And that's about it.
[400.46 → 401.48] Do you know what Title II means?
[401.64 → 401.88] No.
[401.88 → 404.40] Okay, so here's what's going on.
[404.52 → 413.52] So the FCC has tabled a proposal to undo the 2015 rules that implemented net neutrality with a Title II classification.
[414.02 → 415.62] Now, here's what this means.
[415.62 → 422.40] So before 2015, net neutrality was – it had been implemented.
[422.62 → 428.24] There were rules that the FCC had passed to say, okay, here are some things that your ISP cannot do.
[428.50 → 435.78] And the big thing for net neutrality advocates was you couldn't have any sort of unreasonable – what's the word I'm looking for?
[436.06 → 438.16] There's no unreasonable discrimination with network traffic.
[438.58 → 439.14] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[439.20 → 442.76] So that rule was already in place prior to 2015.
[442.76 → 448.64] In 2015, they decided to – the best word to use here would be strengthened it.
[448.72 → 449.90] I guess that depends on your point of view.
[450.22 → 460.14] But they decided to strengthen it by classifying ISPs and Internet services under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934.
[460.72 → 465.22] And what this means is they'll be regulated as what's called a common carrier.
[465.22 → 473.36] And when you do this, what ends up happening is the regulations are a little bit more strict as to, like, what they could do.
[474.04 → 479.50] Now, you may have caught the fact I said the Communications Act of 1934.
[479.78 → 484.60] It was actually enacted a long time ago, and it was originally – sorry, just let me mute my laptop here.
[484.68 → 485.34] That's very distracting.
[485.56 → 485.98] There we go.
[486.14 → 486.32] Okay.
[486.32 → 491.74] Anyway, it was originally designed to regulate landline telephone carriers all the way back in the day.
[491.74 → 491.92] Right, okay.
[492.04 → 497.30] It was amended in 1996, and so now we have the legal framework that we have today.
[497.34 → 504.96] So can you explain – because, like, from a Canadian point of view, this came into our whatever, and we shot it down, like, almost immediately.
[505.20 → 507.02] So I don't even know a ton about it.
[507.02 → 512.32] But the Americans have gone through this a number of times before, have they not?
[512.50 → 516.52] This is maybe, like – this is the third major action I can think of on net neutrality.
[516.52 → 520.84] Yeah, because I've talked about this on WAN Show since, like, 2013.
[521.28 → 521.88] Yeah, exactly.
[521.96 → 522.74] What's going on?
[522.78 → 524.14] Why isn't this permanently blocked out?
[524.20 → 525.62] That's one thing that I super don't get.
[525.72 → 526.50] Okay, so –
[526.50 → 527.96] Because it's been shot down every time, has it not?
[528.26 → 528.86] What do you mean?
[529.00 → 532.72] Oh, like, weakening net neutrality has been shot down every time.
[532.76 → 533.22] Is that what you mean?
[533.76 → 535.80] Okay, it's a little bit complicated.
[535.80 → 546.00] So back in – I believe it was 2010 that maybe they first started to promulgate net neutrality rules, the SEC.
[546.42 → 552.80] So they first did it under a piece of legislation called Section 706.
[553.48 → 557.42] So that's Section 706 of the 1996 Communications Act.
[557.74 → 565.00] And the SEC said, okay, there is something in Section 706 that allows us to say, here's what your ISP can't do.
[565.00 → 568.20] It can't unreasonably discriminate between different forms of traffic, right?
[569.28 → 575.08] So in 2015, that's when they decided to bring in Title II, which is theoretically stronger.
[575.08 → 580.24] And now they want to roll back and kind of go back to the way it was before 2015.
[580.66 → 580.80] Okay.
[581.06 → 583.86] So the concern here is – so there are two sides to this.
[584.70 → 600.20] The telecommunications industry is saying even if you want net neutrality, you don't want it under Title II because the way Title II works is the SEC can just kind of sit there, and they can pick and choose what things in it are applicable to broadband.
[600.20 → 605.60] Because not everything is going to be – because like I said, this is an ancient law that was originally designed for telephone providers.
[605.60 → 606.00] Telephones, yeah.
[606.16 → 608.76] So they can pick and choose what's going to apply to broadband.
[609.78 → 624.62] The telecommunications industry, for reasons I hope are obvious, does not like this because they could at some point – they could legally do more onerous things like rate regulation and actually tell Comcast or Spectrum or whoever else,
[624.62 → 627.70] you must charge this amount for Internet service.
[627.82 → 628.96] They obviously don't want that.
[629.42 → 635.38] The other side of this is saying that, well, if you go back to regulating it under Section 706, it's going to be very weak.
[635.66 → 638.24] I actually have the text of 706 right here in front of me.
[638.36 → 638.96] Oh, my goodness.
[639.10 → 640.40] And it's actually not very much.
[640.40 → 662.06] But it says that the commission with regulatory jurisdiction, blah, blah, blah, shall encourage the deployment on a reasonable and timely basis of advanced telecommunications capability to all Americans in a manner consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity, price regulation, regulatory forbearance, measures that promote competition in the local telecommunications market,
[662.38 → 666.32] and or other regulating methods that remove barriers to infrastructure investment.
[666.32 → 666.64] Okay.
[666.64 → 667.28] Okay.
[667.74 → 671.82] If you can digest that for a second, it's all kind of vague.
[672.06 → 677.92] There's nothing in there that says thou shalt not discriminate against different kinds of traffic.
[678.10 → 678.22] Okay.
[678.46 → 686.04] So the argument from people who are more concerned about net neutrality is that, oh, well, this is very wishy-washy.
[686.10 → 691.54] And even that last bit or other regulating methods that remove barriers to infrastructure investment.
[691.54 → 703.26] So the head of the FCC, who is pro-scrapping the Title II things, people are worried about the bit about infrastructure investment.
[703.58 → 716.22] Because he made a speech a couple of days ago about this, and he said, oh, well, ever since they did this Title II thing where they put strict regulations on ISPs, there's been less money spent on infrastructure investment, which is a bad thing.
[716.22 → 720.66] Because you have less – you're investing less in quality services.
[720.88 → 725.16] But that's a very easy way for them to manipulate that.
[725.40 → 729.52] Because if they know that's one of the things that the FCC is looking for, they're just going to be like, oh, we don't like this law.
[729.58 → 730.18] No more investment.
[730.52 → 730.78] Correct.
[731.26 → 731.48] Yeah.
[731.60 → 733.02] It's an easy thing for them to do.
[733.24 → 738.58] And, you know, there are some other things in his speech I found a little bit eyebrow-raising.
[738.58 → 745.80] One of them was he was saying that, oh, people keep talking about, like, you know, fast lanes for a certain kind of traffic, and they're afraid it's happening.
[746.14 → 748.44] And he was over here claiming that hasn't happened.
[748.62 → 750.42] But it already kind of has.
[750.76 → 756.30] I think it was a couple of years ago, Netflix was forced to pony up a bunch of money to Comcast.
[756.76 → 758.30] Because – was it Comcast?
[758.48 → 759.32] I don't remember who it was.
[759.42 → 760.58] It was one of the major ISPs.
[760.68 → 761.54] I think it was Comcast.
[761.54 → 767.88] But they ended up throttling Netflix's speeds, which for something like streaming HD video was super important.
[768.28 → 770.86] So that actually kind of has already happened.
[770.98 → 775.30] He didn't mention anything in his speech about net neutrality, which was also a little bit concerning.
[775.52 → 777.54] So there are two sides to this.
[778.14 → 785.04] But basically the crux of the argument is which law is this going to be – is net neutrality going to be accomplished under?
[785.18 → 786.62] One is stricter than the other.
[786.62 → 788.08] So someone has asked a question.
[788.28 → 793.16] Shouldn't the FTC be the ones governing net neutrality instead of the FCC?
[793.64 → 795.24] So that's a difficult question to answer.
[795.36 → 798.56] Just for a little bit of background, the FTC is the Federal Trade Commission.
[799.22 → 805.94] They have usually been the federal agency in the U.S. to regulate things like consumer protection and also privacy.
[806.42 → 813.08] So the argument for the people who are on – the sort of the chairman of the FCC, they're on his side that want to scrap these rules
[813.08 → 819.28] and kind of go back to the way things were prior to 2015, they're saying, okay, the FTC has been in charge of consumer protection
[819.28 → 821.24] and consumer privacy for a very long time.
[821.56 → 825.36] Why do we want to take this out of their hands now and put it into the hands of the FCC,
[826.00 → 831.06] which the argument is more ill-equipped to deal with privacy issues and consumer protection issues?
[831.28 → 833.66] Now, whether you buy that or not is a completely separate argument.
[833.66 → 838.90] But there's – the question kind of comes down to what's the inner working of each agency like,
[838.92 → 840.54] and I don't think I'm really qualified to speak on that.
[840.78 → 841.00] Okay.
[841.22 → 841.36] Yeah.
[841.56 → 846.78] Well, if you live in the States and you care about your internet, follow up with the stuff John said.
[847.80 → 849.82] Sorry, it was a lot in the short time period.
[850.10 → 851.10] You fired through it.
[851.14 → 851.66] I'm cool with it.
[852.34 → 858.04] It's kind of a complicated issue because you're getting down into the weeds of what the text of the law actually says.
[858.10 → 858.32] Yeah.
[858.32 → 858.90] So, yeah.
[859.62 → 862.20] But, yeah, that's not a thing for me.
[862.34 → 863.54] I don't want to tell you what to do.
[863.94 → 866.52] I don't use the internet down there.
[866.86 → 868.78] So, yeah, follow it up on your own.
[869.16 → 873.16] I think that would be – if I was down there and this was happening, I would be very interested,
[873.26 → 874.12] and I would be reading up on it.
[874.52 → 874.66] Yeah.
[874.66 → 878.40] Because I started to worry about it when it became a thing up here, but then it was shot down, like, immediately.
[879.04 → 879.56] So it was like, okay.
[879.56 → 885.58] Yeah, and I'm sure, like, the way you're – the framework of how your communications are regulated in Canada
[885.58 → 887.50] is probably very different from what we have in the U.S.
[887.50 → 888.30] So –
[888.30 → 889.88] I don't know, but that would make sense.
[890.20 → 892.48] Anyway, moving on to a new topic.
[892.88 → 894.22] Amazon Alex.
[894.68 → 899.86] I'm just going to call it Alex because I don't want to trigger it, but there's an uh at the end of this.
[900.20 → 901.66] So it's Alex –
[901.66 → 902.28] With an A.
[902.96 → 904.02] Yeah, Alex with an A.
[904.34 → 907.60] Amazon's Alex with an A learns to talk like a human.
[907.60 → 910.28] The reason why we're talking like that and not saying the full name, by the way,
[910.36 → 916.40] is we just don't want to trigger anyone's version of this thing at their home to start searching for stuff.
[916.40 → 918.20] And that has happened before, so –
[918.20 → 920.96] So yeah, Alex with an A is going to be better.
[921.10 → 929.78] It will be able to do things like whisper, take a breath to pause for emphasis, adjust the rate, pitch, and volume of her speech, and more.
[929.78 → 935.06] She'll even be able to bleep out swear words, which is pretty – that's kind of interesting.
[935.44 → 937.56] Especially because she's going to sound more human.
[937.84 → 938.04] Mm-hmm.
[938.60 → 941.06] Be like, man, what is the bleep?
[941.48 → 943.56] Doesn't sound like something very human.
[944.48 → 944.70] Sure.
[944.70 → 947.20] Like most people don't bleep out their own sentences, you know what I mean?
[947.40 → 947.64] Mm-hmm.
[947.84 → 950.80] But I guess maybe if it sounds like a recording of a human, then it would be fine.
[950.86 → 951.22] I don't know.
[951.28 → 952.06] I kind of wish we could.
[952.14 → 954.70] I think swear words are actually funnier when they're bleeped.
[954.70 → 957.06] Just start saying bleep instead of a swear word?
[957.50 → 958.02] Well, no.
[958.20 → 964.86] Like if you watch any kind of TV show where something gets bleeped out, I think it actually adds a little bit of comic effect.
[964.98 → 965.64] Maybe I'm crazy.
[965.76 → 966.78] The sharpness of the tone.
[967.06 → 967.20] Yeah.
[967.20 → 972.40] The new tools are being provided to third-party app developers, allowing them to control pronunciation,
[972.84 → 975.22] intonation, timing, intonation.
[975.56 → 975.94] Wow.
[976.00 → 977.24] I just read that super terribly.
[977.60 → 978.84] Timing and emotion.
[979.76 → 980.66] Which is pretty cool.
[981.58 → 981.78] There you go.
[981.78 → 990.12] I think that's awesome because the more natural these things are, paired with hopefully the back end getting a little bit better,
[991.24 → 993.84] it's going to be very awesome for voice-assisted support.
[993.84 → 998.70] My main thing that I'm excited for is locally-based voice-assisted support,
[998.86 → 1004.44] where not everything that I say has to go into some permanently logged box somewhere that I don't have access to.
[1004.44 → 1006.26] Yeah, follow that one at F for Fat Chance.
[1006.32 → 1006.92] Yeah, I know.
[1007.34 → 1007.54] I know.
[1007.76 → 1008.62] I'll know about that.
[1008.96 → 1014.86] I'm just hoping that eventually some tertiary, like these things get so good at some point,
[1014.90 → 1018.66] and it's so easy to do this stuff, that some side company just makes one that you can buy.
[1019.48 → 1022.10] I mean, that would, I think there would be a...
[1022.10 → 1023.34] That would be way more down for that.
[1023.34 → 1027.26] There would be, I think, a pretty big segment of the market that would be interested in something like that.
[1027.26 → 1029.34] Yeah, like a personal Jarvis.
[1029.34 → 1034.62] I had this idea a really long time ago where I wanted to string all these mics throughout my house
[1034.62 → 1041.68] and have all of them at the same time permanently recording onto this giant notepad
[1041.68 → 1045.98] that was going to automatically delete chunks above and rewrite and all this kind of stuff,
[1046.02 → 1048.66] and I was going to have Dragon speaking permanently running,
[1048.98 → 1053.32] so that it tried to dictate everything that was said within my house onto this notepad,
[1053.32 → 1057.42] and then I was going to have another program watching the notepad and making actions based on what was there.
[1057.58 → 1058.66] And then I was like, no.
[1060.28 → 1062.64] What would be the ultimate point of something like that?
[1062.64 → 1063.54] My own Jarvis.
[1063.54 → 1064.54] I don't know.
[1064.54 → 1065.54] I don't know.
[1065.54 → 1066.54] I don't know.
[1066.54 → 1067.54] I don't know.
[1067.54 → 1068.54] I see.
[1068.54 → 1069.18] The problem is me.
[1069.34 → 1074.16] Yeah, that last bit, you kind of lost me there because to me, it almost sounded like you just wanted to transcribe your own speech.
[1074.24 → 1078.62] No, no, no, because there would be another bot watching the dog for, like, words that might show up.
[1078.82 → 1086.16] So if I said, like, Jarvis or whatever else, it would then pay proper attention to the next few words that come up,
[1086.48 → 1088.66] and then it would, like, do whatever I need it to do.
[1089.18 → 1089.42] Yeah.
[1089.42 → 1090.90] I'm just not – I'm not –
[1090.90 → 1096.70] If only you had a massive team of coders handy and, like, a massive, like, machine learning apparatus.
[1097.00 → 1097.34] Yeah.
[1097.52 → 1100.32] I'm working on getting a massive team of coders readies.
[1101.32 → 1105.96] So far I have not enough, but the ones that I have are awesome because we're doing good things.
[1106.36 → 1108.80] Boiler's been learning frontend.
[1109.38 → 1109.74] Really?
[1109.96 → 1110.40] Yeah.
[1110.40 → 1110.66] All right.
[1110.84 → 1111.62] It's been great.
[1111.62 → 1116.30] I would rather he was able to work on the stuff that he's particularly very good at.
[1116.54 → 1117.86] It's good that he's learning everything.
[1118.02 → 1118.40] Hi, Boiler.
[1119.42 → 1122.38] But, yeah, I need more support for him.
[1123.30 → 1124.36] I'm working on it.
[1124.42 → 1134.50] Elon Musk at Ted Vancouver was teasing a Tesla electric semi-truck up to four new Gigafactory locations as well,
[1134.64 → 1135.98] which is pretty freaking cool.
[1137.56 → 1139.42] This guy is going to take over the world.
[1139.42 → 1144.42] There was a picture of SpaceX, and they had, like, one of the –
[1144.42 → 1147.42] Rockets?
[1148.32 → 1148.86] Fuselage?
[1149.42 → 1150.46] The fuselage of the rocket.
[1150.50 → 1150.70] Yeah.
[1150.70 → 1151.22] The main body of the rocket.
[1151.22 → 1153.24] They had one of the fuselages of the rockets.
[1153.24 → 1153.64] Yeah.
[1153.64 → 1156.92] They had the giant boring machine, and they had, like, one other thing.
[1157.02 → 1159.12] And it was like, what is even happening here?
[1159.24 → 1159.58] Yeah.
[1160.02 → 1161.12] It was so awesome.
[1161.28 → 1166.00] Anyway, Elon Musk on stage at 2017 TED Conference in Vancouver today.
[1166.00 → 1171.94] He showed a shadowy image, which I will hopefully have – I do not have a source for you.
[1172.38 → 1174.32] A smooth, continuous design.
[1174.56 → 1175.64] Yeah, way to go, James.
[1175.78 → 1179.54] A smooth, continuous design between the windshield and the upper facade.
[1179.54 → 1187.48] So, that would be very – I don't know how else to describe that.
[1188.54 → 1190.40] I think it will look very futuristic.
[1190.76 → 1190.92] Yeah.
[1191.14 → 1193.02] Can you try to – is there pictures of this thing?
[1193.02 → 1193.46] Yeah.
[1193.90 → 1198.04] Elon Musk Electric Semi.
[1198.58 → 1205.74] Musk also said that there will likely be four, like I just said, new Gigafactory sites announced this year, but none quite yet.
[1205.74 → 1214.58] The company said in its most recent earnings report that it plans to finalize locations for up to three new Gigafactory sites this year in addition to the existing Nevada location.
[1214.60 → 1217.52] It's just a teaser image, but it looks kind of cool.
[1217.66 → 1217.96] I don't know.
[1218.18 → 1220.08] It looks like a semi-truck.
[1220.30 → 1222.54] Well, the headlights are very Tesla-like.
[1222.84 → 1224.58] Is that actually the one that was shown on the stream?
[1225.00 → 1228.26] That's what it looks like, yeah, based on the caption here.
[1228.84 → 1230.90] Give me one quick second to get this on screen.
[1231.06 → 1231.56] Yeah, there you go.
[1231.64 → 1232.14] Just any of those.
[1234.16 → 1234.56] Cool.
[1234.56 → 1234.64] Cool.
[1235.28 → 1236.02] Right there.
[1236.26 → 1237.64] Can I blow this up a little bit maybe?
[1239.84 → 1240.72] New tab.
[1242.10 → 1242.84] There we go.
[1243.50 → 1250.42] So it's kind of hard to tell, but yeah, you can see there's a seam there were the windshield hits the top, but it's not like a major difference.
[1250.56 → 1250.98] I don't know.
[1251.16 → 1251.34] No.
[1251.56 → 1252.68] It looks like a semi-truck.
[1254.32 → 1257.08] I'm excited for it, but it looks like a semi-truck.
[1257.08 → 1259.76] Are you planning to get your CDL and become a truck driver, Luke?
[1259.80 → 1260.12] Yeah.
[1260.40 → 1262.00] I'm going to abandon Flow plane Club.
[1262.12 → 1263.66] I'm going to abandon Linus Media Group.
[1263.66 → 1266.96] I'm just going to drive a truck, which is going to be automated in a few years anyway.
[1268.06 → 1269.52] I just hate having a job.
[1270.56 → 1274.70] So I just want to go down a career where it will take my job away.
[1275.90 → 1279.04] You know, there's a difference between hating your job and hating having a job.
[1280.08 → 1282.36] Because I think most people, the second thing is probably true.
[1282.36 → 1283.58] I don't hate having this job.
[1284.24 → 1285.50] I didn't say a particular job.
[1285.50 → 1288.68] I would prefer to come to work every day because I'm a weird person.
[1288.86 → 1291.34] I'm talking about like...
[1291.34 → 1293.20] I prefer to come to work late every day.
[1293.26 → 1293.66] Oh, no.
[1293.66 → 1296.30] I'm talking about worrying living in a box is what I mean.
[1296.36 → 1296.66] Oh, yes.
[1296.66 → 1299.76] Not the doing a certain thing.
[1299.82 → 1300.86] Minor complications.
[1301.66 → 1302.54] No big deal.
[1302.82 → 1303.02] Yeah.
[1303.02 → 1308.16] Also, there's apparently a UK Iron Man who demonstrated a flying suit.
[1308.26 → 1309.42] I'm going to have to see this one.
[1309.90 → 1311.02] He's a British inventor.
[1313.40 → 1316.84] Apparently, he flew it at the TED conference in Vancouver, which is pretty sick.
[1317.98 → 1319.32] You can see him right here.
[1320.12 → 1321.20] This is his suit.
[1321.20 → 1325.72] You can see him there as well.
[1325.88 → 1327.24] How far off the ground did he get?
[1327.36 → 1328.30] That's what I would like to know.
[1328.84 → 1330.86] He doesn't look like he's that far off the ground.
[1331.12 → 1334.64] But it looks like he's got some type of propulsion on his legs.
[1335.02 → 1336.68] Kind of like Star Wars rocket boots.
[1336.94 → 1337.16] There's a video.
[1337.32 → 1337.80] There's a short video.
[1337.80 → 1339.28] And he's got some on his hands.
[1339.98 → 1341.34] Which is actually pretty cool.
[1341.48 → 1341.82] Yeah, yeah.
[1343.02 → 1345.10] I guess it's more of a proof of concept than anything.
[1345.10 → 1348.08] Like, I can hover above the ground.
[1348.10 → 1348.78] Yeah, yeah.
[1348.86 → 1350.06] So, this is possible.
[1350.06 → 1351.24] Look at me, Mom.
[1352.58 → 1355.30] The suit can fly uninterrupted for around 10 minutes.
[1355.42 → 1358.28] That's actually pretty good, considering how slimline the suit is.
[1358.52 → 1360.36] It doesn't seem that big on him.
[1360.54 → 1362.94] It's a decent size, but it doesn't seem way too big.
[1363.08 → 1364.78] I mean, that's not bad, considering...
[1364.78 → 1366.92] How long was the Wright Brothers' first flight?
[1367.00 → 1367.94] How long did that last for?
[1368.00 → 1369.24] Like, 15 seconds or something?
[1369.36 → 1371.82] So, I mean, 10 minutes is looking pretty good next to that.
[1371.90 → 1372.60] There he goes.
[1373.20 → 1374.30] That's pretty sick.
[1374.48 → 1376.12] Whoa, there's a bunch of power on there.
[1378.08 → 1379.78] I wonder how hard that is to control.
[1379.78 → 1380.88] He seems to be doing pretty good.
[1380.90 → 1385.34] Yeah, because it looks like he is just keeping it steady, just using his arms alone.
[1385.46 → 1386.56] Like, there's no...
[1386.56 → 1387.72] Because I was thinking, like...
[1387.72 → 1392.86] On this one, in other mock-up models, like the one right below it, you can see the rockets
[1392.86 → 1393.56] on his feet.
[1393.62 → 1394.08] Oh, yeah.
[1394.24 → 1396.96] This one, it just seems like he has them on his arms and possibly his back.
[1396.98 → 1397.52] Oh, there we go.
[1397.52 → 1398.60] There's something on his back as well.
[1398.72 → 1398.90] Yeah.
[1399.14 → 1400.78] But he doesn't have the feet ones on.
[1401.16 → 1403.10] So, I guess there are a few different iterations.
[1403.76 → 1404.72] That's pretty cool, though.
[1405.34 → 1406.30] That is pretty cool.
[1406.30 → 1407.74] I want one of those.
[1407.80 → 1408.72] Here's a different one.
[1410.56 → 1412.46] He can move around pretty quick.
[1412.58 → 1412.82] Mm-hmm.
[1414.56 → 1417.06] I just like the idea of, like, super extended jumps.
[1419.44 → 1420.46] Like, jump assist.
[1420.66 → 1421.92] That's in a few different games.
[1422.82 → 1426.04] Or, like, you go to jump something and you, like, blast this thing, and it gives you a little
[1426.04 → 1427.00] bit more distance and height.
[1427.24 → 1428.78] That would be super cool, in my opinion.
[1429.10 → 1431.30] I'm just trying to think of the possibilities with something like this.
[1431.48 → 1431.70] Man.
[1431.70 → 1432.82] Glide to work.
[1433.16 → 1437.18] You make a slimline version of this that you can wear that just kind of looks like a normal
[1437.18 → 1437.62] backpack.
[1438.64 → 1442.08] And maybe the wrist and leg things aren't, like, way too big, but they're, like, nicely
[1442.08 → 1442.54] integrated.
[1442.68 → 1443.76] I would be super down.
[1443.90 → 1444.40] Oh, me too.
[1444.56 → 1445.40] That would be so cool.
[1446.00 → 1448.88] You know, like, if that's something like that ever does hit the market, like, what the
[1448.88 → 1450.46] early adopter tax is going to be on it?
[1450.80 → 1451.22] Oh, yeah.
[1451.34 → 1452.92] But, like, you can float.
[1453.04 → 1454.46] Casey Estate video comes out.
[1454.46 → 1459.04] He's riding on a boosted board and then there's, like, a big gap and he just, like, hops up
[1459.04 → 1460.82] and floats over it.
[1461.10 → 1461.50] Damn.
[1462.36 → 1463.56] All while filming somehow?
[1464.10 → 1464.80] He'll make it work.
[1464.92 → 1465.90] 18 trillion views.
[1467.02 → 1467.86] Billions of views.
[1468.90 → 1469.84] All the views.
[1470.86 → 1471.64] Oh, man.
[1471.74 → 1472.28] There you go.
[1472.80 → 1473.76] I thought that was pretty sick.
[1473.94 → 1477.14] There's also, okay, so you said you had something to say about this.
[1477.42 → 1479.46] Please to scan soccer fans' faces.
[1479.46 → 1485.82] Yeah, so this is going to be at this year's UEFA Champions League final in Cardiff in Wales.
[1486.46 → 1490.04] So there's going to be cameras around the stadium and also at the main train station
[1490.04 → 1490.48] in Cardiff.
[1490.90 → 1495.46] And so the expected attendance is, this says 170,000.
[1495.58 → 1499.24] I don't think Millennium Stadium in Cardiff can hold 170,000 people.
[1499.36 → 1501.54] I think it was probably supposed to be 70,000.
[1501.64 → 1502.04] Let me see.
[1502.36 → 1503.24] I'm going to view this real quick.
[1503.88 → 1505.66] Millennium Stadium, Cardiff.
[1505.88 → 1506.74] Let's find out.
[1506.74 → 1510.00] Capacity, 75,000.
[1510.10 → 1510.34] Okay.
[1510.64 → 1514.62] So I think that was supposed to be a little bit north of 70K.
[1514.92 → 1519.32] They're going to compare it against a police database of 500,000 people of interest.
[1519.54 → 1519.98] People of interest.
[1520.50 → 1525.00] So if there's a match, police will get a heads-up that could help them stop a terrorist
[1525.00 → 1526.56] or frequent hooligan.
[1527.14 → 1527.92] Frequent hooligan.
[1527.92 → 1528.68] Well, here's the thing.
[1528.82 → 1534.56] So in European soccer, there are, if you get banned from like one stadium for doing something
[1534.56 → 1537.62] particularly bad, you can get banned from a lot of them.
[1537.86 → 1540.84] And hooliganism isn't as bad there as it used to be.
[1540.92 → 1545.94] But if you ever watch soccer, English soccer, European soccer, you can still see some of the
[1545.94 → 1548.18] legacies of the hooligan era back in the 1980s.
[1548.18 → 1552.50] Like they still have crowd segregation at all the Premier League games.
[1552.62 → 1556.66] So if you watch a Premier League game, it's not like in the U.S. or Canada where if you
[1556.66 → 1560.14] are a fan of the visiting team, just get a ticket, sit wherever you want to, cheer for
[1560.14 → 1562.84] your team and hope nothing bad happens like that guy did through the can at me.
[1563.56 → 1563.92] Yes.
[1564.12 → 1564.96] That was okay.
[1565.22 → 1566.18] That guy was a jerk.
[1566.38 → 1567.04] Different story.
[1567.04 → 1573.02] But in Britain, you will see, so there will be a specific section in every stadium for
[1573.02 → 1573.80] visiting supporters.
[1574.08 → 1580.68] And what will often happen is you'll see stewards, basically like stadium workers in like really
[1580.68 → 1584.38] bright day-old jackets standing all around the perimeter of where the opposing supporters
[1584.38 → 1588.94] are just to prevent any fights or any sort of other unseemly behaviour.
[1589.38 → 1590.46] Oh my goodness.
[1590.60 → 1595.86] So yeah, there's all these legacies of the hooligan era that you can still see in European
[1595.86 → 1596.24] soccer.
[1596.24 → 1602.06] So obviously when one person does something bad at one place, if it's bad enough, they'll
[1602.06 → 1607.78] just say, okay, you're banned from every soccer venue in Europe for six months, a year, five
[1607.78 → 1609.44] years for life, depending on how bad it is.
[1609.66 → 1612.60] So I'm guessing this is why they want to do that.
[1613.54 → 1615.20] Doesn't this sound a little preemptive?
[1616.80 → 1618.08] Yes and no.
[1618.32 → 1619.90] Some of the instances over there have been pretty bad.
[1619.96 → 1624.64] I mean, if you look at who's playing, maybe it's going to be one of Real Madrid and Atlético
[1624.64 → 1627.50] Madrid versus one of Juventus in Monaco.
[1627.90 → 1630.80] So it's probably not going to be a huge rivalry in the final.
[1630.88 → 1634.52] But even so, every big club has a few people that are going to come, and they're going to
[1634.52 → 1636.28] try to cause trouble just because they can.
[1636.28 → 1639.42] So, but there obviously is a concern here.
[1640.10 → 1644.28] It says, South Wales police will have to order the country's usage guidelines, only harvesting
[1644.28 → 1647.62] as much information as they really need and being transparent with the data they collect.
[1647.96 → 1652.48] But there has already been evidence of police forces, both in the UK and abroad, preserving
[1652.48 → 1654.58] face recognition data for innocent people.
[1654.58 → 1656.30] So how are they using that data?
[1657.28 → 1657.64] Yeah.
[1657.98 → 1658.34] Yeah.
[1659.20 → 1661.88] And like the frequent hooligans' thing, I get it.
[1661.94 → 1665.14] But if you like, if you screw around a bunch, and then you're like, okay, I'm going to not
[1665.14 → 1666.10] be a jerk anymore.
[1666.44 → 1666.76] Mm-hmm.
[1667.94 → 1670.40] Are you going to get blamed if something bad happens?
[1670.54 → 1674.44] If a ride happens in your area, and you're just trying to flee that area because you're
[1674.44 → 1676.36] like, I'm not about that life anymore.
[1676.52 → 1676.78] Yeah.
[1677.62 → 1681.24] Like, are you going to get screwed anyway because you got picked up by a facial scan?
[1681.24 → 1682.58] Oh man, that's a good question.
[1682.86 → 1687.54] Like that, I mean, because a lot of, a lot of places do keep known hooligan databases.
[1687.96 → 1688.98] So that is that.
[1689.26 → 1690.06] Known hooligan databases.
[1690.06 → 1691.20] That is actually a thing.
[1691.40 → 1694.00] But as far as what is, I don't know.
[1694.12 → 1697.90] Like that's a good, I guess that would be, I guess that would be a little bit of a risk.
[1697.90 → 1700.78] But you know if they all captured on camera, maybe that would exonerate you too.
[1700.90 → 1701.36] So who knows?
[1701.80 → 1703.12] Yeah, I guess we'll see.
[1703.24 → 1703.44] Yeah.
[1704.14 → 1705.12] No way to tell for now.
[1705.22 → 1705.94] I don't like it.
[1706.00 → 1707.36] I don't like the preemptive stuff.
[1707.36 → 1712.04] I'm trying to think if any of those four clubs have like a large and active hooligan
[1712.04 → 1712.44] firm.
[1712.58 → 1716.52] But then again, you know, you also have to worry about individual people just having too
[1716.52 → 1717.90] much to drink and causing problems too.
[1718.08 → 1718.44] So who knows?
[1718.70 → 1718.88] Yeah.
[1719.22 → 1719.88] That's a good call.
[1720.20 → 1723.56] Now are you, I know you're a Nintendo fan in terms of Mario Kart.
[1723.64 → 1725.72] Are you a Nintendo fan for their mobile stuff?
[1727.00 → 1727.94] What specifically?
[1728.42 → 1729.58] Like 3DS, 2DS?
[1729.70 → 1731.14] Oh yeah, I have a 3DS.
[1731.24 → 1732.24] I have a number of games for it.
[1732.34 → 1733.44] So what do you think about this?
[1733.44 → 1735.94] They have a new 2DS XL.
[1736.14 → 1738.70] I'm going to throw the video up here and mute it.
[1739.74 → 1745.46] But essentially, it's a 3DS XL without 2D capability.
[1745.56 → 1746.80] As far as I can really tell.
[1747.00 → 1747.28] For $80?
[1747.66 → 1748.44] No, no, no, no, no.
[1748.52 → 1749.02] Is that what it says?
[1749.02 → 1749.46] Or no?
[1749.66 → 1751.24] 150 US dollars.
[1751.52 → 1752.34] Wait, where does it say?
[1752.96 → 1754.06] Oh, oh, oh.
[1754.44 → 1755.00] I'm sorry.
[1755.06 → 1756.28] That was for the original 2DS.
[1756.54 → 1756.72] Yeah.
[1756.98 → 1757.54] Well, okay.
[1757.58 → 1759.64] I think the price is a little bit steep for what it is.
[1759.64 → 1764.74] But as far as just, you know, that aside, just looking at the concept, I think this is a really, perfect idea.
[1765.20 → 1771.98] The 3D on the 3DS, I mean, it's pretty okay for what it is, but it's not for everybody.
[1772.22 → 1774.46] Like my wife has a 3DS as well.
[1774.86 → 1776.34] Never uses the 3D feature.
[1776.68 → 1783.34] I use it on mine, but if it's for, if it one day just broke, and I can never use it again, I wouldn't miss it very much.
[1783.46 → 1784.54] What do you use it for?
[1784.66 → 1785.24] For everything?
[1785.24 → 1791.96] I try to turn it on when I can because it's a feature which I paid for, so I might as well try to use it and get some kind of enjoyment out of it.
[1791.96 → 1797.98] Okay, but if you have the option to buy one or the other, and one's like, how much is a 3DS XL in the States?
[1798.06 → 1798.26] Do you know?
[1799.86 → 1801.68] I think they're a little bit cheaper than these.
[1801.76 → 1807.58] It's closer to 200, so I think you're saving about 40 or 50 dollars with this thing.
[1807.70 → 1807.96] Okay.
[1808.06 → 1808.84] With the new 3DS.
[1808.94 → 1809.10] Yeah.
[1809.58 → 1813.00] Because in Canada, I think these are like about 200 bucks.
[1813.00 → 1821.76] And I think that original unibody design was what turned a lot of people away from the original 2DS because it just, it wasn't as portable, it wasn't very attractive.
[1822.08 → 1823.78] It's a very durable system.
[1824.02 → 1824.28] Yes.
[1824.36 → 1825.96] I've had a 2DS in the past.
[1826.14 → 1831.46] I traded it in and got a 3DS XL eventually, but it's a very durable system, but yeah, it's not very wildly.
[1831.74 → 1833.14] Now, I'm going to do a straw poll.
[1833.76 → 1835.80] I'm interested in the Nintendo people out there.
[1835.80 → 1842.48] Do you like the 3D option on your 3DS?
[1845.60 → 1846.88] So yes, no, and indifferent?
[1848.32 → 1848.72] Yes.
[1848.72 → 1855.24] And this is specifically for Nintendo people out there.
[1855.32 → 1858.10] Don't press indifferent if you don't own one, and you don't care.
[1858.32 → 1864.22] Only press indifferent if you do own one, and you're like, yeah, I turn it on sometimes, but it's not amazing.
[1864.66 → 1865.28] I don't know.
[1865.64 → 1869.22] Now we're going to get a bunch of indifferent spam from the PSV to throw out.
[1869.30 → 1869.56] I don't know.
[1870.26 → 1870.98] I don't know.
[1870.98 → 1872.74] Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[1873.06 → 1874.14] We'll come back to that later.
[1874.40 → 1874.54] Cool.
[1874.90 → 1877.56] But yeah, it's a little bit different.
[1877.72 → 1880.76] It can play 3DS games, but without the 3D effect.
[1881.46 → 1883.50] It can also play normal DS games.
[1884.98 → 1890.80] The main thing is unlike the 2DS, instead of being flat, it does fold now, which is very good.
[1890.86 → 1892.02] I think it needs to be much cheaper.
[1892.58 → 1895.98] Apparently, it still packs the same power as the 3DS XL.
[1895.98 → 1908.26] They're claiming that this addition to the handheld market demonstrates their commitment to the handheld market.
[1909.90 → 1911.10] So, yeah, that's cool.
[1911.32 → 1912.46] Again, it's $150.
[1913.10 → 1919.46] It launches in Australia and New Zealand on June 15th and in the U.S. on July 28th.
[1920.30 → 1922.98] Is the Switch going to just cannibalize part of the market for this thing?
[1923.02 → 1924.18] This is why I'm saying it needs to be cheaper.
[1924.18 → 1925.64] Okay, I think a little bit.
[1925.64 → 1927.96] But this is something I've talked to other people about.
[1928.06 → 1929.62] The Switch is kind of delicate.
[1930.62 → 1930.80] Yeah.
[1931.08 → 1932.38] And it can't fold.
[1932.54 → 1933.42] And it's pretty big.
[1933.50 → 1934.76] You can't just fit it in your pocket.
[1935.34 → 1940.32] And if you get the case for it so you're actually protecting it properly, it's pretty freaking big.
[1940.40 → 1941.60] It's going to go in like a backpack.
[1941.86 → 1943.96] Well, you can't fit a 3DS XL in your pocket.
[1944.14 → 1945.54] A standard 3DS, yeah.
[1945.88 → 1946.50] I can.
[1947.88 → 1950.54] In all of my pants and all of my shorts.
[1950.72 → 1951.04] Okay.
[1951.32 → 1952.02] Get rest!
[1952.02 → 1954.40] Okay, Luke.
[1954.54 → 1955.62] But it's still...
[1955.62 → 1956.72] I got big pockets.
[1956.92 → 1957.48] It's still rather...
[1957.48 → 1958.72] Luke has large pockets.
[1958.90 → 1960.72] He thinks it's very important that you know this.
[1960.72 → 1961.40] Not full of money.
[1961.98 → 1963.10] They're empty in that regard.
[1963.28 → 1963.68] Most unfortunately.
[1963.68 → 1965.98] But they can fit a 3DS XL, which is pretty cool.
[1966.12 → 1968.38] I think it needs to be closer to $100 still.
[1968.62 → 1970.08] I really think it's a little bit cheaper.
[1970.58 → 1971.24] I think...
[1971.24 → 1971.70] Like, okay.
[1971.76 → 1973.86] Can you look up how much a 3DS XL costs?
[1974.00 → 1974.32] Sure.
[1974.46 → 1975.16] In U.S. dollars?
[1975.16 → 1976.92] I think it's $190.
[1977.08 → 1978.22] I'll look on Amazon, I guess.
[1978.22 → 1979.90] I'm going to check on the straw poll real quick.
[1980.40 → 1980.98] You do that.
[1982.36 → 1983.28] 3DS XL.
[1983.70 → 1984.86] No, not 3S XL.
[1984.96 → 1985.48] 3DS.
[1985.74 → 1986.22] There we go.
[1987.52 → 1989.94] So 51% of people said no.
[1990.02 → 1990.74] Oh, goodness.
[1990.90 → 1993.50] 29% of people said indifferent.
[1993.50 → 1996.64] And only 20% of people said yes.
[1997.36 → 1998.00] You know what?
[1998.04 → 2002.70] On Amazon, it's closer to $250, which I don't think is right.
[2004.12 → 2005.82] They're really expensive in Canada.
[2005.82 → 2006.42] You know what?
[2006.66 → 2007.24] Let me check.
[2007.54 → 2009.28] I'm checking the U.S., but let me check Walmart.
[2011.06 → 2014.32] If you just wanted to go to Walmart and buy a 3DS XL, how much would that be?
[2015.20 → 2015.56] Enter.
[2015.84 → 2016.12] Come on.
[2017.36 → 2017.72] $250.
[2017.88 → 2019.16] Also closer to $250.
[2019.28 → 2021.08] I could have sworn they were cheaper than that.
[2021.16 → 2022.08] I don't think so, man.
[2022.08 → 2023.56] I got mine for less than $200.
[2023.72 → 2024.50] I do remember that.
[2024.72 → 2025.92] Probably like a sale or something.
[2026.06 → 2029.08] Like, Walmart does really aggressive sales on these in holiday season.
[2029.16 → 2029.28] Yeah.
[2029.44 → 2031.18] So right now they're closer to $250.
[2031.70 → 2035.14] I still think they should be a little bit cheaper because if you're saying the original
[2035.14 → 2039.70] 2DS has been dropped to $80, you're paying almost twice that so you can get one of the folds.
[2039.90 → 2041.94] I think the 2DS didn't sell very well.
[2042.56 → 2045.46] I bet you they're dropping it to $80 to try to kind of get rid of it.
[2046.14 → 2051.82] Because, like, I don't think I've ever seen one in the wild that wasn't like my brother's.
[2051.82 → 2058.36] I think I saw a small child on a 2DS one time somewhere and that was it.
[2058.78 → 2059.28] So, yeah.
[2059.28 → 2060.66] They are pretty dang durable, though.
[2060.68 → 2061.22] That's the thing.
[2061.38 → 2061.48] Yeah.
[2061.62 → 2062.40] If you got, like, yeah.
[2062.56 → 2069.86] A 3DS or a 2DS XL or a normal 2DS are far more durable than a Switch.
[2070.06 → 2070.18] Yeah.
[2070.18 → 2070.30] Mm-hmm.
[2070.90 → 2071.66] They just are.
[2072.62 → 2073.10] Absolutely.
[2073.10 → 2076.26] Now the Switch has Zelda, but still.
[2077.02 → 2077.26] Anyway.
[2077.66 → 2078.76] Sponsor spot time!
[2078.94 → 2079.56] Oh, here we go.
[2079.98 → 2082.24] We have to put our glasses on.
[2082.46 → 2082.92] Here we go.
[2083.10 → 2083.56] There we go.
[2083.64 → 2084.22] So these are pretty cool.
[2084.26 → 2085.88] These are called Spectrum Glasses.
[2086.64 → 2091.08] They say staring at a monitor all day can be hard on your eyes over time and make it tougher
[2091.08 → 2091.74] to fall asleep.
[2091.86 → 2097.28] That's why things, there's certain, like, applications that you can put on your desktop that will, like,
[2097.28 → 2099.56] change the colour of your screen exist, but then.
[2099.56 → 2101.30] The idea is to reduce the blue light.
[2101.54 → 2101.86] Yeah.
[2102.04 → 2102.26] Yeah.
[2102.32 → 2105.62] But then those are kind of annoying because if you need to see, like, the true colour of
[2105.62 → 2110.24] something, just being able to do that is pretty cool instead of something, I think it's called
[2110.24 → 2110.86] FLIR.
[2111.06 → 2111.32] Nope.
[2111.54 → 2111.76] Nope.
[2111.82 → 2112.48] That's a camera.
[2112.62 → 2113.34] That's the IR cam.
[2113.34 → 2113.44] Flux.
[2113.62 → 2113.74] Yeah.
[2114.10 → 2114.78] F. Lux.
[2115.24 → 2118.60] It actually, like, changes the colour of your screen, which I'm not personally a fan of.
[2118.92 → 2123.64] Now, I have not been wearing these a ton lately, but they seem comfortable to me.
[2123.64 → 2128.78] But we have someone in office who has been wearing them almost since he got hired.
[2129.42 → 2130.66] And he likes it a lot.
[2131.72 → 2131.80] Who?
[2132.32 → 2132.60] James.
[2132.86 → 2132.98] Oh.
[2133.38 → 2133.54] Yeah.
[2133.72 → 2134.80] James has been wearing them.
[2135.50 → 2139.30] If he hears this and wants to come down here and be a model for the glasses, that would
[2139.30 → 2139.98] be fantastic.
[2140.66 → 2141.78] They look good.
[2141.94 → 2143.12] We have a bunch of different models.
[2143.36 → 2144.34] I like these.
[2144.58 → 2145.48] John likes those.
[2145.50 → 2146.66] Yeah, these are like kind of gray charcoal.
[2146.86 → 2147.12] They're good.
[2147.36 → 2152.56] There's another pair that don't look particularly that great on me, but they look perfect on
[2152.56 → 2152.98] Dennis.
[2153.64 → 2154.46] They're these.
[2154.60 → 2155.58] Or at least I don't think they look that great on me.
[2155.58 → 2157.00] Aren't those like the Burberry style ones?
[2157.16 → 2158.00] I believe so.
[2158.12 → 2158.32] Yeah.
[2158.64 → 2158.90] Yeah.
[2159.18 → 2159.34] Yeah.
[2159.52 → 2165.40] And I actually do like these a fair bit because, like, if you have a smartphone, which of course
[2165.40 → 2169.80] the vast majority of you do, if you get like an app that says it reduces blue light,
[2169.88 → 2173.48] sometimes the effect can be too aggressive and everything has like this really noticeable
[2173.48 → 2174.18] red twinge.
[2174.70 → 2178.88] Through these computer screens and things, they still look very natural.
[2179.10 → 2179.28] Very normal.
[2179.28 → 2183.46] There's obviously a difference, but if you put the glasses on, it doesn't look like the
[2183.46 → 2185.08] colour is super off or untoward.
[2185.14 → 2186.06] It looks very natural.
[2186.16 → 2187.40] It's just slightly less blue.
[2187.70 → 2187.96] So there you go.
[2187.96 → 2192.14] One of the big things that James said, he's one of the writers here, so he spends a lot
[2192.14 → 2194.92] of time staring at like Word docs and spreadsheets all day.
[2195.24 → 2199.34] So with that much bright light, he said that it's helped a lot, which is cool.
[2199.58 → 2200.00] That's good.
[2200.00 → 2202.24] They feel nice.
[2202.32 → 2203.86] They come with a one-year warranty.
[2204.58 → 2206.54] They say their product is extremely durable.
[2207.28 → 2210.78] The low colour distortion, they block high energy blue light.
[2210.86 → 2211.78] That's the whole point.
[2212.28 → 2214.52] But they do try to keep colours as similar as possible.
[2214.62 → 2215.66] That's something we just talked about.
[2215.80 → 2218.18] It doesn't actually seem to change that much, which is cool.
[2218.26 → 2223.84] If you're interested, go to spectrumglasses.com slash collections slash products.
[2223.84 → 2229.80] The link will be below on YouTube and use offer code Linus to save 10% off.
[2230.06 → 2233.02] And this is actually a Vancouver startup, so they're a local for us.
[2233.36 → 2233.48] Yeah.
[2233.66 → 2235.90] And I think it's cool that James has actually been using them.
[2236.14 → 2238.48] It says James has been wearing these nonstop for weeks.
[2238.78 → 2240.44] Weeks as in, I think, above four.
[2240.68 → 2242.90] Like, I think it's been quite a while, and he likes them a lot.
[2243.34 → 2247.04] Apparently, he started wearing them so close to his actual start date of working here that
[2247.04 → 2248.90] people thought that they were just his normal glasses.
[2249.86 → 2250.40] Oh, yeah.
[2250.44 → 2253.54] So that's why I didn't know who was wearing them because I thought he just wore glasses.
[2253.54 → 2254.18] Yeah, yeah.
[2254.28 → 2259.40] So those are his glasses, which is cool that they actually kind of blend in.
[2259.82 → 2261.80] You would think they were just normal glasses.
[2261.94 → 2264.08] But no, they have technology.
[2265.06 → 2270.18] Our other sponsor today is – oh, I did that whole thing without doing this.
[2271.36 → 2272.96] There's the link that you guys need.
[2273.08 → 2274.26] We're going to put the glasses back on.
[2274.44 → 2276.54] If you want these, go here.
[2277.54 → 2278.08] There we go.
[2278.14 → 2278.56] There we are.
[2278.64 → 2280.78] Yeah, use offer code Linus to save 10% off.
[2281.24 → 2283.36] Again, they filter out blue light from your monitor.
[2283.36 → 2286.24] That's like the most aggressive, intense light that you can have.
[2286.96 → 2293.04] Moving on, we have Cooler Master with their Master Keys Pro line of keyboards.
[2293.38 → 2294.20] That's not in there.
[2294.26 → 2294.78] Don't take it out.
[2294.90 → 2296.78] I have the one with the keyboard in it.
[2297.76 → 2300.94] Anyway, Master Keys Pro keyboards come in different sizes.
[2301.22 → 2302.78] I have the medium.
[2302.96 → 2304.78] John has the large.
[2304.78 → 2305.06] L.
[2305.52 → 2306.22] Oh, my.
[2306.22 → 2311.14] They complete the Cooler Master keyboard portfolio, which is cool.
[2312.16 → 2315.02] It can be simple because you just pick your Switch colour.
[2315.18 → 2316.08] So this one is a blue.
[2316.20 → 2317.16] Is that one also a blue?
[2317.28 → 2318.42] That one is also a blue.
[2318.68 → 2319.06] Cherry blue.
[2319.24 → 2320.88] These were probably picked for me.
[2321.26 → 2324.14] Blue is my favourite colour, although it does annoy people on my stream.
[2324.32 → 2324.78] That's fine.
[2325.00 → 2325.56] You like blue?
[2325.62 → 2326.26] What's your favourite colour?
[2326.70 → 2327.36] My favourite colour?
[2327.44 → 2328.26] My favourite colour or Switch?
[2328.52 → 2328.92] Switch.
[2328.92 → 2332.50] That's a difficult question.
[2332.72 → 2333.30] I like greens.
[2333.58 → 2334.06] Greens.
[2334.18 → 2334.88] I'm a green guy.
[2335.16 → 2335.56] Special.
[2335.68 → 2336.94] I like my greens.
[2337.16 → 2337.60] Rare.
[2338.12 → 2338.38] I know.
[2338.42 → 2338.90] Uncommon.
[2339.30 → 2339.52] Yes.
[2340.34 → 2346.50] The Master Keys Pro white M and L have LED backlighting, which is cool.
[2346.62 → 2350.08] If you're into a brighter, clean white keyboard, that could be for you.
[2350.44 → 2357.28] It utilizes the ARM Cortex M3 processor on its on-the-fly system, which is pretty cool.
[2357.28 → 2364.40] It has lighting modes, macro recording, and combined with four profile keys, which are
[2364.40 → 2365.20] somewhere.
[2366.84 → 2368.30] They have easy-to-use software.
[2368.84 → 2372.76] They've combined N-key and 6-key rollover together, which is cool.
[2372.92 → 2376.06] It's ideal for both work and play because it's a keyboard.
[2377.14 → 2382.22] So you can WAS Don it, and you can home row, which is cool.
[2382.36 → 2383.22] That's totally up to you.
[2383.44 → 2385.04] Check them out at the link below.
[2385.04 → 2388.38] That's CoolerMaster.com slash product slash line slash keyboards.
[2389.76 → 2390.12] Yeah.
[2390.98 → 2391.34] Cool.
[2391.80 → 2392.00] Cool.
[2392.16 → 2394.48] Or check out the link in the video description on YouTube.
[2395.96 → 2396.64] And there we go.
[2396.90 → 2397.36] I'll take that back.
[2398.24 → 2398.52] Oh!
[2398.60 → 2399.18] Oh, no!
[2399.40 → 2401.30] At least you hit the thing in front of it.
[2401.44 → 2402.64] I'm going to put these back on, actually.
[2403.04 → 2403.20] Yeah.
[2403.84 → 2404.16] There we go.
[2404.16 → 2404.74] They're pretty good.
[2405.06 → 2405.66] They're pretty good.
[2405.82 → 2406.28] I like them.
[2406.48 → 2406.76] There you go.
[2406.76 → 2410.88] I don't know if they look that great on me, but I like them.
[2410.88 → 2411.58] Let's get Dennis out here.
[2411.62 → 2411.98] I think they're cool.
[2411.98 → 2413.00] Dennis can come out here and model.
[2413.10 → 2413.24] Dennis.
[2413.24 → 2413.36] Yes.
[2413.60 → 2413.80] Dennis.
[2413.98 → 2414.18] Dennis!
[2416.10 → 2416.38] Dennis!
[2418.80 → 2419.62] Can you hear that?
[2419.66 → 2420.50] I can hang out some.
[2420.84 → 2421.14] Cool.
[2421.34 → 2421.54] Yeah.
[2422.52 → 2423.10] Oh, there we go.
[2423.16 → 2423.50] There he is.
[2423.58 → 2424.12] There he is.
[2424.16 → 2424.80] Put these on.
[2426.00 → 2426.84] And stand in front of the air.
[2426.86 → 2427.06] Wait, Joe?
[2427.24 → 2428.10] You have to be our model.
[2428.64 → 2429.08] Wait, Joe.
[2429.44 → 2429.64] Okay.
[2430.18 → 2431.48] So these are my glasses.
[2431.98 → 2432.14] No?
[2432.48 → 2433.54] These are just regular glasses.
[2433.64 → 2433.78] Yeah.
[2434.48 → 2435.02] Let's see.
[2435.02 → 2435.94] Do I look different?
[2436.84 → 2437.52] Not very.
[2437.66 → 2437.90] No.
[2437.98 → 2438.68] I think they look good.
[2438.70 → 2439.62] They look so natural.
[2439.98 → 2441.32] I can't see now.
[2444.16 → 2445.04] I like this.
[2445.44 → 2446.70] Actually, I actually like this one.
[2446.98 → 2447.66] Here, one second.
[2447.86 → 2448.42] Put them back on.
[2448.86 → 2449.24] Hold on.
[2449.56 → 2449.90] Hold on.
[2456.98 → 2457.38] Okay.
[2457.64 → 2457.84] Okay.
[2457.84 → 2458.62] Put your other glasses on.
[2459.64 → 2459.94] Oh.
[2460.82 → 2463.02] Oh, I think this one's a little bit bigger.
[2463.46 → 2463.64] Yeah.
[2464.34 → 2464.66] Oh.
[2465.02 → 2466.24] But what do they do?
[2466.56 → 2467.74] They filter out blue light.
[2467.88 → 2470.26] So look at the screen and then put the glasses on.
[2470.38 → 2470.96] See how that works?
[2471.66 → 2471.98] Yeah.
[2472.36 → 2472.56] Yeah.
[2472.90 → 2473.16] Yeah.
[2473.94 → 2474.14] Yeah.
[2474.46 → 2475.80] So it's supposed to be less harsh on your eyes.
[2475.88 → 2477.26] You can fall asleep easier afterwards.
[2477.36 → 2477.86] All that kind of stuff.
[2478.88 → 2480.94] Am I going to sleep at work if I wear this?
[2482.44 → 2483.82] It makes it easier to fall asleep.
[2483.88 → 2484.96] It's not going to put you asleep.
[2485.58 → 2486.60] They're not sleeping pills.
[2486.72 → 2487.36] They're just glasses.
[2487.36 → 2491.42] But it'll make it less harsh so you're not forced to kind of stay up.
[2491.58 → 2493.70] Anyway, back to normal content.
[2494.22 → 2500.88] AMD puts two GPUs and 32 gigs of RAM on a Radeon Pro Duo graphics card.
[2500.88 → 2507.82] So Brandon saw this down at NAB but decided not to – wow, this is the Ars Technica show, apparently.
[2508.24 → 2513.76] We have so many Ars Technica news articles today, which is cool.
[2513.84 → 2514.60] I like those guys.
[2515.46 → 2521.46] But yeah, Brandon saw this down at NAB, but they weren't showing perfect demos.
[2521.74 → 2523.08] That is a lot of appealing colour.
[2523.40 → 2523.64] Yeah.
[2523.80 → 2524.80] I actually really like it.
[2524.84 → 2525.00] Yeah.
[2525.36 → 2525.56] Yeah.
[2525.74 → 2526.00] Wait.
[2529.14 → 2531.08] Actually, yeah, because it filters out blue lights.
[2531.24 → 2532.56] Yeah, but it still looks solid.
[2533.54 → 2535.46] This is the longest ad spot ever.
[2535.46 → 2537.98] Oh, I'm not even looking at Twitch chat.
[2538.16 → 2538.40] Yeah.
[2538.60 → 2539.26] Oh, my God.
[2539.36 → 2539.74] Yeah, probably.
[2540.08 → 2540.34] Sorry.
[2540.50 → 2542.10] That isn't even – I was just interested.
[2542.10 → 2548.52] Yeah, the card combines two Polaris GPUs for $1,000, and it launches in May.
[2548.64 → 2551.90] This is not targeted as a gaming card.
[2551.98 → 2552.20] No.
[2552.36 → 2552.90] At all.
[2552.98 → 2556.84] They launched it at a like, camera and film show.
[2557.14 → 2559.32] They didn't even announce it to us at all.
[2559.72 → 2561.54] Like, it's not a gaming card.
[2561.68 → 2563.24] But it is super cool regardless.
[2563.46 → 2566.48] And you get what appears to be the Team Rocket logo on the fan.
[2566.76 → 2567.08] Yeah.
[2567.10 → 2568.48] It's, like, almost exactly the same.
[2568.68 → 2569.76] I really like the blue.
[2569.76 → 2574.44] I really like the position of these power connectors, especially with the types of systems that it's probably going to go in.
[2574.50 → 2574.68] Yeah.
[2575.20 → 2579.12] And the fact that you might have a bunch of them in a row if you're going to do something like that.
[2579.20 → 2583.32] So, yeah, that's going to make it much easier if you have tight gaps between your graphics cards.
[2583.60 → 2583.88] Absolutely.
[2583.88 → 2584.32] Yeah.
[2584.32 → 2592.74] AMD claims 11.45 teraflops of performance compared to 16 for the older Radeon Pro.
[2593.26 → 2598.06] But one that is also substantially cheaper, cooler, and less power hungry.
[2598.42 → 2600.16] And you get dramatically more RAM.
[2600.30 → 2601.40] 32 gigs.
[2603.10 → 2603.98] That's crazy.
[2603.98 → 2609.12] Just think of how much stuff you could hold in your frame buffer with 32 gigs of RAM.
[2609.40 → 2611.94] You would never be wanting for a large frame buffer ever again.
[2611.94 → 2612.62] A whole game.
[2612.88 → 2613.28] Basically.
[2614.06 → 2614.30] Yeah.
[2614.84 → 2617.44] Let me just render this entire game first.
[2618.00 → 2619.22] Every possible scenario.
[2619.38 → 2620.54] No, that's obviously way too much.
[2620.60 → 2620.94] But still.
[2621.18 → 2621.58] I don't know.
[2621.66 → 2622.80] I think that's pretty cool.
[2622.94 → 2624.84] It's not, like, it's not for us.
[2624.98 → 2625.58] It's not for gamers.
[2625.66 → 2626.22] You can go over here.
[2626.92 → 2627.32] Ugh.
[2627.66 → 2628.28] Every time.
[2628.42 → 2628.62] Yeah.
[2628.62 → 2631.14] I need to work on my chair positioning.
[2631.14 → 2633.76] You know, most people probably, actually maybe.
[2634.08 → 2636.32] There could be a ton of H3 fans in the audience.
[2636.60 → 2640.50] Have you ever watched the H3 show when Hila's, like, like this?
[2640.50 → 2642.86] Oh, and she just pushes Ethan out of the screen.
[2642.96 → 2645.22] No, she, like, goes out on her own.
[2645.46 → 2645.74] Oh.
[2645.94 → 2648.84] And I feel like whoever sits on this side, because that normally happens to me.
[2649.16 → 2650.34] And Linus is pulling me over.
[2650.34 → 2651.12] Is this more, like, slanted or something?
[2651.18 → 2652.74] I don't know.
[2652.78 → 2653.36] I don't know.
[2653.46 → 2656.92] I think it's because you have to end up sitting, like, way on this side of the table.
[2657.18 → 2657.42] Yeah.
[2657.42 → 2660.94] So everyone wants to naturally correct themselves to where they're supposed to be on the table.
[2661.14 → 2662.32] There's something in that, yeah.
[2662.56 → 2662.82] Yeah.
[2663.46 → 2663.86] Anyway.
[2664.80 → 2665.76] Moving on.
[2665.94 → 2666.98] Let's see what else we have.
[2667.04 → 2669.04] The show's technically been over for 13 minutes.
[2669.22 → 2670.64] But I want to look at this one, too.
[2670.98 → 2674.86] Fallout is bringing post-apocalyptic warfare to your tabletop.
[2676.10 → 2678.12] Actually not an Ars Technica article this time.
[2678.12 → 2679.36] Wait, the show's been over for 15 minutes?
[2679.44 → 2679.60] What?
[2679.80 → 2681.70] No, like, it's an...
[2681.70 → 2681.94] Oh!
[2683.18 → 2684.64] My Twitch page just died.
[2684.64 → 2686.38] I wanted to post the link in the chat.
[2686.78 → 2687.62] Come back, Twitch.
[2687.74 → 2687.92] No.
[2688.12 → 2688.72] Okay, it's fine.
[2688.94 → 2689.54] This is fine.
[2689.54 → 2692.74] I think it's supposed to be about an hour long.
[2693.32 → 2693.44] Oh.
[2693.66 → 2697.20] We still have 15 minutes, then.
[2697.38 → 2698.30] Because we started at 4.30.
[2698.34 → 2698.82] It's only 5.15.
[2698.84 → 2699.80] Oh, my goodness!
[2699.90 → 2701.76] I thought we started at 4 for some reason.
[2701.88 → 2702.44] That was weird.
[2702.58 → 2703.98] Anyway, Fallout 4.
[2704.30 → 2705.06] Miniatures game.
[2705.14 → 2706.28] Goes on sale this November.
[2706.40 → 2707.26] Don't worry about it.
[2707.28 → 2707.78] It's cool.
[2708.44 → 2709.08] It's fine.
[2709.08 → 2713.30] Apparently, it was possibly going to crowdfund, but it is not.
[2713.36 → 2714.86] I'm not entirely sure if that's true.
[2714.92 → 2716.94] It just says it'll skip crowdfunding.
[2717.82 → 2718.02] Mm-hmm.
[2718.68 → 2719.32] I don't know.
[2720.14 → 2723.22] Anyway, some of the miniatures are detailed down here, which look pretty cool.
[2723.46 → 2723.78] Oh, let's see.
[2723.78 → 2724.64] You guys can't see anything.
[2724.86 → 2725.00] There you go.
[2725.00 → 2726.74] So, we're going to, like, paint-it-yourself miniatures again?
[2726.86 → 2727.14] Yeah.
[2727.22 → 2727.36] Yeah.
[2727.46 → 2731.04] So, people other than me might be good at it, which would be pretty cool.
[2731.18 → 2735.16] If I got into a miniatures game, I would definitely have to fund someone else to paint my miniatures,
[2735.24 → 2736.54] or I'd just be all gray all the time.
[2736.72 → 2737.16] One of the two.
[2738.14 → 2739.74] What if you, like, 3D-
[2739.74 → 2740.28] Ashen skin.
[2740.42 → 2743.86] What if, like, 3D-printed, like, a colour scheme directly onto it?
[2744.90 → 2745.82] Would that even work?
[2746.64 → 2750.80] If you got, like, if you got some filament that took a little bit longer to dry,
[2751.74 → 2754.22] and you could just, like, sort of-
[2754.22 → 2756.88] So, paint with melted plastic?
[2757.66 → 2761.90] If you could get a nozzle or, like, a thing that had, like, fine enough control or something.
[2761.98 → 2762.34] I don't know.
[2762.60 → 2767.28] But then, as I'm doing art, it's still me doing art, which is bad.
[2768.42 → 2772.38] But at least you won't have to worry about, like, holding your hand super steady, you know?
[2772.66 → 2772.92] Yeah.
[2773.04 → 2775.18] I would still really, really, really suck at it.
[2775.28 → 2775.42] Okay.
[2775.72 → 2779.44] But there are some of the monster enemies, which are pretty cool.
[2779.54 → 2780.52] Let me see if I can pull this up.
[2780.94 → 2781.22] Wow.
[2781.22 → 2782.52] It's all transparent stuff.
[2783.56 → 2784.58] Good job, Polygon.
[2785.28 → 2786.44] It looks neat.
[2786.68 → 2787.32] It looks cool.
[2788.18 → 2792.60] I'd be interested to see someone actually play it, because I'm not a huge miniatures person myself.
[2792.84 → 2797.06] I'm really into the Star Wars Edge of the Empire role-playing game.
[2797.20 → 2798.04] That's super fun.
[2798.14 → 2802.72] And I'm really into, like, other tabletop games, but I've never gotten into a miniatures game.
[2802.86 → 2804.60] We should get Tyler on the show to talk about this.
[2805.02 → 2805.30] Maybe.
[2805.52 → 2805.74] Yeah.
[2805.74 → 2812.08] The main reason why I haven't is that the cost scares the ever-living crap out of me.
[2812.08 → 2812.58] Oh, yeah.
[2812.74 → 2812.86] Of course.
[2812.86 → 2814.04] Those things are so expensive.
[2814.92 → 2815.50] My goodness.
[2815.64 → 2816.92] We started playing...
[2816.92 → 2820.18] What is the name of that football game we started playing?
[2820.18 → 2820.26] Blood Bowl.
[2820.46 → 2820.88] Blood Bowl.
[2820.94 → 2821.80] We started playing Blood Bowl.
[2822.06 → 2823.10] We still haven't done the finals.
[2823.82 → 2827.10] It's Anthony versus me for the finals, and we just haven't done it.
[2827.44 → 2831.02] And the trophy looks like the Lombardi trophy, except the football has spikes on it.
[2831.02 → 2832.98] It's gold instead of silver, but yeah.
[2834.78 → 2835.72] Let's see here.
[2835.86 → 2836.78] More topics.
[2837.34 → 2840.46] Microsoft is completing their Windows Phone wind-down by June.
[2840.46 → 2842.46] Okay, this is just...
[2842.46 → 2844.36] This isn't even a tech topic.
[2844.54 → 2845.58] It's just hilarious.
[2846.34 → 2849.74] A Russian spy ship was sunk by a sheep barge.
[2850.74 → 2852.46] So I don't know...
[2852.46 → 2854.24] I don't even really...
[2854.24 → 2860.66] The circumstances just seem so random, because it was a Togolese ship.
[2860.66 → 2866.92] It was a ship with the Togo flag carrying sheep between Jordan and Romania.
[2867.82 → 2867.92] Yeah.
[2868.04 → 2869.34] It's the most random thing.
[2869.84 → 2873.26] And a Russian ship hit it, and the Russian ship sunk.
[2873.76 → 2874.22] Yeah.
[2874.60 → 2875.40] A spy ship.
[2875.72 → 2877.02] A Russian spy ship.
[2877.18 → 2881.72] So the Russian ship was built in 1970, and it was converted into an intelligence collection
[2881.72 → 2883.02] vessel in 1989.
[2883.96 → 2885.88] That's it right there, I guess.
[2886.24 → 2886.48] Yep.
[2886.48 → 2886.54] Yep.
[2890.66 → 2892.12] Oh, there's the barge.
[2892.32 → 2894.24] So that's a pretty big barge.
[2894.34 → 2894.74] Oh, okay.
[2894.92 → 2895.42] It was...
[2895.42 → 2898.58] When you're reading the description for it, the barge sounds like a raft.
[2898.70 → 2899.10] It does.
[2899.18 → 2899.88] It sounds like...
[2899.88 → 2900.88] That thing's ginormous.
[2900.92 → 2903.26] It sounds like a pile of wood they just put some sheep in.
[2903.26 → 2904.08] Yeah, yeah.
[2904.18 → 2905.14] Told it to go float, yeah.
[2905.48 → 2907.42] Okay, that's a pretty intense...
[2907.42 → 2909.46] That's not like some random raft with a...
[2909.46 → 2910.38] No, it's not.
[2910.52 → 2911.10] This is like...
[2911.10 → 2911.60] With a shepherd and some sheep.
[2911.60 → 2913.58] This is like inertia in action.
[2913.88 → 2914.84] Like, you can't...
[2914.84 → 2915.04] Yeah.
[2915.72 → 2917.04] So it just got super wrecked.
[2917.10 → 2919.26] That's far less interesting than I thought it was.
[2921.00 → 2922.08] Anyway, moving on.
[2922.18 → 2922.80] Oh, my goodness.
[2922.88 → 2923.10] Okay.
[2924.02 → 2924.74] Next topic.
[2925.56 → 2927.00] We do have other topics.
[2927.08 → 2927.92] We do have other topics.
[2928.26 → 2929.76] The Windows Phone wind down.
[2930.14 → 2930.46] AMD.
[2932.32 → 2932.64] AMD.
[2932.64 → 2935.00] This topic was posted by Mule on the forum.
[2935.20 → 2936.64] We're going to jump over on the forum real quick.
[2936.72 → 2937.52] Make sure I'm not logged in.
[2937.58 → 2938.08] That's good.
[2938.08 → 2944.24] AMD making money from ad revenue from installing drivers.
[2944.56 → 2947.08] So apparently when you install one of their new drivers...
[2948.30 → 2951.08] Yeah, so Terry McAdoo.
[2952.02 → 2953.12] Hopefully I'm saying that right.
[2953.76 → 2956.98] Says that some of you didn't like game icons installed.
[2957.20 → 2959.54] So we updated the Radeon software package without one.
[2959.84 → 2960.64] We heard you.
[2960.96 → 2961.30] Sorry.
[2961.78 → 2964.56] So without having an option for it,
[2964.56 → 2967.58] it just linked game icons onto your desktop,
[2967.58 → 2968.86] which were shortcuts,
[2969.16 → 2974.44] with monetized tagged links to go get the game, I guess.
[2974.54 → 2978.58] And I can't think of a demographic that has less tolerance for bloatware
[2979.20 → 2981.36] than people who are really into PC gaming.
[2981.58 → 2982.58] I'm amazed that...
[2983.72 → 2983.86] Yeah.
[2984.86 → 2987.16] It was even a bit.ly tracking link,
[2987.22 → 2989.82] so they weren't even trying to hide that it was happening.
[2990.26 → 2992.28] It wasn't a direct link to the official page.
[2992.34 → 2993.96] Like I said, it was a bit.ly tracking link.
[2993.96 → 2997.12] It had a referral ID included in the final URL destination.
[2999.62 → 3003.36] Man, first they draw the capsaicin molecule the wrong way.
[3003.44 → 3003.86] Now this.
[3004.66 → 3005.02] Okay.
[3005.14 → 3006.36] Do you want to explain that a little bit?
[3007.76 → 3008.36] Oh, okay.
[3008.42 → 3009.02] You put me on the spot.
[3009.60 → 3009.96] Go for it.
[3010.04 → 3010.86] I believe in you.
[3010.86 → 3012.42] So the capsaicin thing,
[3012.48 → 3019.74] it was like what they were calling some of their events surrounding their new Radeon stuff, right?
[3019.74 → 3019.86] Yeah.
[3019.86 → 3023.80] Because capsaicin is the chemical that makes hot peppers,
[3023.94 → 3025.66] and hot peppers, what colour do you think of?
[3025.74 → 3027.08] Red, like AMD Radeon.
[3027.20 → 3028.04] So capsaicin.
[3028.40 → 3030.60] So they had like a whole branding package up for this.
[3030.64 → 3031.76] Can you pull the logo up, actually?
[3032.84 → 3033.24] Yes.
[3033.34 → 3033.92] Give me a second.
[3034.34 → 3034.70] Greatly.
[3034.74 → 3036.54] Just type capsaicin and cream, and you'll find it.
[3036.54 → 3040.66] Luke is going to pull up the logo of this thing here.
[3042.02 → 3043.56] So image search will probably help you.
[3044.12 → 3044.80] There you go.
[3045.04 → 3046.16] I'm working on it.
[3046.16 → 3046.30] Okay.
[3046.40 → 3046.88] There we go.
[3047.34 → 3047.58] Okay.
[3047.92 → 3048.84] So can we pull that up?
[3049.30 → 3049.68] Very good.
[3049.78 → 3055.28] So that is purportedly the molecular structure of capsaicin,
[3055.40 → 3057.10] except there's a huge problem here.
[3057.76 → 3059.56] You're going to have to draw with your mouse here.
[3059.68 → 3059.90] Yes.
[3059.96 → 3065.14] This ring over here, this ring, this sort of six corner, this hexagon here.
[3065.14 → 3068.40] So the thing about capsaicin is this ring is actually aromatic,
[3068.70 → 3072.64] which means you should have a double bond here, a double bond here,
[3072.72 → 3073.62] and a double bond here.
[3073.80 → 3074.98] And they're not even real double bonds.
[3075.34 → 3078.08] What's actually happening is the electrons are sort of going,
[3078.50 → 3080.24] whee, like that, like all around.
[3080.42 → 3081.70] These are all carbon atoms.
[3081.84 → 3083.62] Each corner is a carbon atom, right?
[3084.02 → 3089.44] So they neglected to put in the double bonds or the aromaticity in this.
[3089.52 → 3092.10] And so the molecule is actually not capsaicin.
[3092.20 → 3093.28] It's something completely different.
[3093.28 → 3096.12] I don't know what it is, but it's not capsaicin.
[3096.20 → 3098.56] It's not the same stuff that actually makes your hot peppers.
[3099.02 → 3101.12] And they went to the trouble of saying,
[3101.50 → 3104.90] oh, we're going to use this organic chemistry model in our branding.
[3105.10 → 3107.34] So if you do that, you should really do it correctly.
[3108.02 → 3110.14] I mean, this is a field where, like,
[3110.18 → 3113.62] if you know anything about, like, pharmaceuticals, for example,
[3113.68 → 3114.94] where if you have one molecule,
[3115.54 → 3117.72] if you take it, and you make it a mirror image,
[3117.78 → 3121.38] a change as small as that can completely change what it does inside your body.
[3121.38 → 3125.18] So this is not correct, and it bothers me.
[3125.38 → 3129.12] So first this, and now they're putting bloatware in with their drivers.
[3129.62 → 3130.52] What next, AMD?
[3131.48 → 3131.92] Don't.
[3132.98 → 3133.78] What next?
[3133.86 → 3134.16] Just don't.
[3134.16 → 3136.66] You're going to turn your ice cream machines off past 2 a.m.?
[3136.66 → 3138.52] I monitored in chemistry in college.
[3138.64 → 3139.18] That's why I know this.
[3139.18 → 3140.70] Yeah, just to explain.
[3140.94 → 3141.06] Yeah.
[3141.88 → 3142.28] Okay.
[3142.90 → 3146.74] Probably last, because we're just running out of ad topics,
[3146.88 → 3147.90] to be completely honest.
[3148.00 → 3148.64] Ad topics?
[3148.86 → 3149.56] Show topics.
[3150.04 → 3152.52] There is a 3D printer with tank treads,
[3153.30 → 3156.18] which is just sort of awesome.
[3156.18 → 3157.10] Twitch chat is going to blow up here in a second.
[3157.64 → 3158.34] Ad topics.
[3158.56 → 3160.54] I was thinking about the AMD ad thing.
[3160.62 → 3160.86] Mm-hmm.
[3161.64 → 3163.40] I'm just going to post this in Twitch chat.
[3163.40 → 3171.64] What didn't you minor in college, says Twitch chat.
[3171.76 → 3173.64] Well, I minored in chemistry and political science,
[3173.70 → 3175.60] so everything that aren't those two things.
[3176.40 → 3177.18] So there we go.
[3177.54 → 3178.12] Okay, what's happening?
[3178.84 → 3182.44] MIT's mobile 3D printer built the largest structure to date.
[3182.70 → 3184.70] So you can kind of see it there.
[3184.92 → 3185.46] Here we go.
[3185.54 → 3186.04] There's a video.
[3186.04 → 3186.34] Cool.
[3186.34 → 3187.28] Which I will mute.
[3187.28 → 3194.44] So it's spraying out, like, a lot of stuff at a time,
[3194.52 → 3196.56] and it's sort of foaming up a little bit.
[3196.64 → 3197.26] Looks like Cool Whip.
[3197.90 → 3198.74] Cool Whip.
[3198.80 → 3199.22] Cool Whip.
[3199.60 → 3203.90] So that is a 3D printer that is driving around in order to lay its,
[3204.14 → 3206.26] I guess, I don't know if you can call it filament,
[3206.82 → 3208.00] to lay its stuff.
[3208.18 → 3209.36] I don't know what it starts as.
[3209.74 → 3210.18] Excretions.
[3210.40 → 3210.68] Yeah.
[3210.90 → 3211.66] There you go.
[3211.96 → 3212.92] Look at it go.
[3213.26 → 3213.62] Whee!
[3214.32 → 3215.38] Looks like a big pot.
[3215.72 → 3216.20] Like a pot or anything.
[3216.20 → 3217.18] That is super cool.
[3217.18 → 3217.62] That is cool.
[3218.34 → 3221.68] I feel like the military would be super stoked with something like this.
[3221.72 → 3224.62] Oh, like if you could, like, quickly have some sort of, like,
[3224.68 → 3226.20] shelter for things.
[3226.20 → 3226.44] Yeah.
[3226.54 → 3227.20] Like a field.
[3227.34 → 3227.82] Yeah, definitely.
[3228.72 → 3230.82] Seriously doubt whatever it just printed is, like,
[3230.88 → 3232.12] a defensible structure.
[3232.48 → 3235.88] But if you could just throw up something that people could shelter in,
[3235.96 → 3236.04] absolutely.
[3236.04 → 3236.62] Yeah, exactly.
[3236.78 → 3239.46] You know, this could be useful, like, or for, like, I don't know,
[3240.88 → 3243.56] disaster relief or something if you need a bunch of temporary shelters
[3243.56 → 3243.98] for people.
[3244.30 → 3244.46] Yeah.
[3244.46 → 3244.64] Yeah.
[3245.06 → 3245.54] I don't know.
[3245.66 → 3245.96] I don't know.
[3245.96 → 3248.08] I think that is pretty sick.
[3248.20 → 3251.50] It looks like a very, it's like the universal constructor from Deus Ex,
[3251.58 → 3254.56] except much more rudimentary, but still very, very cool because we don't
[3254.56 → 3255.94] live in a fictional universe.
[3256.26 → 3258.36] But MIT.
[3258.62 → 3260.66] That is a wild, I want to see that GIF again of it.
[3260.90 → 3261.30] Whoop.
[3261.46 → 3261.80] Okay.
[3261.94 → 3262.46] Here we go.
[3264.04 → 3264.44] Whoop.
[3264.44 → 3268.50] So is Caltech going to make a slightly better one just to one-up MIT?
[3269.22 → 3270.48] I feel like that might happen.
[3272.10 → 3272.98] MIT or Caltech?
[3273.04 → 3273.28] Go.
[3274.24 → 3275.18] I have to choose one?
[3275.26 → 3275.44] Yep.
[3275.92 → 3277.68] No basis for comparison, though.
[3277.78 → 3277.92] Nope.
[3277.92 → 3281.88] I used to live in Boston, and I kind of wanted to go to MIT when I was a kid, so MIT, I guess.
[3281.98 → 3282.40] There you go.
[3282.52 → 3282.94] East Coast.
[3283.10 → 3283.34] Done.
[3283.48 → 3283.78] There you go.
[3283.78 → 3285.76] It's a clear and definitive decision.
[3285.84 → 3286.94] MIT is better than Caltech.
[3287.24 → 3288.42] I didn't say that.
[3289.84 → 3292.36] If you're watching this from Caltech, I did not say that.
[3292.64 → 3298.94] Apparently antivirus software from Web Root nukes a customer's machine.
[3299.20 → 3301.56] I need to dive into this a little bit more.
[3301.94 → 3303.12] I'm going to post this in the chat.
[3303.64 → 3305.06] What is that picture?
[3305.62 → 3307.58] It is an ice cream cone.
[3307.58 → 3308.86] It's a spilled ice cream cone that's melted a little bit.
[3308.88 → 3309.18] Cool.
[3309.86 → 3310.18] Good.
[3310.64 → 3310.90] Good.
[3311.66 → 3317.08] Again, it's the Ars Technica show, so we keep going with Ars Technica news.
[3319.88 → 3320.96] What's the scoop?
[3320.96 → 3321.36] Okay.
[3321.58 → 3321.90] Get it?
[3322.02 → 3328.86] Understand where the ice cream cone thing came in on this false positive issue that has crippled a quarter of my customers.
[3329.86 → 3330.30] Wow.
[3330.74 → 3331.18] Brutal.
[3331.48 → 3332.16] It's pretty bad.
[3333.02 → 3335.46] Apparently Web Root just wrecked some stuff.
[3335.68 → 3337.92] I haven't used any of their software in a very, very long time.
[3338.18 → 3338.36] Yeah.
[3338.42 → 3338.94] What do you use?
[3339.06 → 3339.50] Defender?
[3340.10 → 3340.56] Yeah.
[3340.62 → 3344.14] Just whatever comes with Windows because I'm careful about my browsing habits.
[3344.58 → 3346.44] So many people these days just on Defender.
[3346.44 → 3351.88] The Defender and then every once in a while download the free trial sweep of Malwarebytes.
[3352.08 → 3352.30] Yeah.
[3352.48 → 3353.32] That's like...
[3353.32 → 3357.68] Sometimes you might need something specialized to get things off if you already have a problem,
[3357.68 → 3359.26] but like, you know...
[3359.26 → 3360.76] I just reformat every once in a while.
[3360.90 → 3363.38] Use Defender and be careful about re-brows.
[3363.54 → 3366.46] Apparently Web Root was flagging Facebook as a phishing site.
[3367.32 → 3367.80] Nice.
[3368.22 → 3369.72] That's possibly accurate.
[3370.60 → 3370.86] Web Root.
[3371.10 → 3371.92] What is a phishing site?
[3371.98 → 3372.12] Sorry.
[3372.12 → 3380.32] A signature update that it had just nuked hundreds of benign files that were needed to run Microsoft Windows.
[3381.14 → 3383.70] As well as apps that run on top of the operating system.
[3383.90 → 3386.02] And it flagged Facebook as a phishing site.
[3386.08 → 3386.78] Where's the...
[3386.78 → 3387.54] Perfect.
[3387.70 → 3389.58] The delete system 32 mean?
[3389.62 → 3389.90] Yeah.
[3390.00 → 3391.56] Like, that would be appropriate right here.
[3391.92 → 3393.56] You know what the most secure computer is?
[3393.90 → 3395.08] One that can't run.
[3395.32 → 3395.54] Yeah.
[3395.60 → 3396.48] I was just about to say...
[3396.48 → 3397.14] Does it function?
[3397.14 → 3398.28] The most secure computer?
[3398.52 → 3399.24] An Abacus.
[3399.52 → 3399.70] Yeah.
[3399.78 → 3401.02] And Colton doesn't know what that is, I think.
[3401.04 → 3401.36] Yeah, I know.
[3401.86 → 3402.64] Sounds like a dragon.
[3402.84 → 3403.76] Do you know what an Abacus is?
[3403.90 → 3404.14] No.
[3404.58 → 3404.88] What?
[3404.88 → 3406.38] You know the GeoGuessr video?
[3406.50 → 3408.98] I said overclocking an Abacus, and Colton was like, what's that?
[3409.10 → 3409.82] Ah, that's the way...
[3409.82 → 3410.62] That's where I heard it.
[3411.44 → 3413.58] It's the little thing that you have beads on.
[3413.58 → 3413.76] Straw pole.
[3413.76 → 3414.54] It's like the beads around.
[3414.54 → 3414.70] Straw pole.
[3414.70 → 3414.88] Straw pole.
[3414.88 → 3415.32] It's like...
[3415.32 → 3415.94] No, no, no, no, no, no!
[3417.02 → 3417.48] Crap.
[3418.76 → 3420.66] You said Straw pole after I started my explanation.
[3420.80 → 3421.48] This is not my fault.
[3421.48 → 3422.22] Sorry.
[3422.22 → 3425.04] Do you know...
[3425.04 → 3425.76] Or did.
[3426.28 → 3429.82] Did you know what an Abacus is?
[3430.60 → 3432.86] Do I look like I know what a JPEG is?
[3432.86 → 3433.50] This is 1B, yes.
[3439.72 → 3440.50] Disc, disc.
[3441.58 → 3442.52] Okay, let's see.
[3442.66 → 3443.98] This is going to be the last thing on the show.
[3444.06 → 3446.04] I want to see how old I am.
[3447.06 → 3448.62] That's what this poll is all about.
[3448.64 → 3450.68] Do modern kids not know what Abaca are?
[3451.52 → 3451.92] Maybe.
[3452.22 → 3452.62] No.
[3453.04 → 3453.36] Maybe.
[3453.52 → 3453.68] Okay.
[3453.82 → 3454.58] Is it Abaca?
[3455.02 → 3458.40] Well, it sounds like Latin, and a plural of US is I.
[3458.52 → 3458.68] Yeah.
[3458.80 → 3462.06] So, I could be just completely making that up.
[3462.28 → 3462.74] But, you know what?
[3462.78 → 3463.34] Let's search it.
[3463.38 → 3463.86] Let's Google it.
[3464.32 → 3465.46] Oh, thank goodness.
[3465.60 → 3467.02] I'm not too old.
[3467.10 → 3467.40] Okay.
[3467.74 → 3469.28] That is a thing that people know.
[3469.38 → 3469.94] The Abacus.
[3470.04 → 3472.12] Plural Abaca or Abacuses.
[3472.26 → 3472.92] Whichever you'd like.
[3473.30 → 3473.62] Abacuses.
[3474.26 → 3475.66] I think Abaca sounds sexier.
[3475.78 → 3476.86] Abaca sounds better.
[3477.04 → 3478.42] Have me those Abaca over there.
[3478.48 → 3479.38] I need to crunch some numbers.
[3479.38 → 3482.18] That sounds like a really cool name of a protagonist.
[3483.18 → 3483.62] Abaca?
[3484.04 → 3484.44] Abaca.
[3484.48 → 3485.48] It sounds almost biblical.
[3486.00 → 3488.16] Like Abaca in the quest for truth.
[3488.80 → 3490.12] Can someone make that video game?
[3490.24 → 3490.38] Yeah.
[3490.44 → 3491.52] Let's make that happen.
[3491.78 → 3493.12] Or like band name.
[3493.12 → 3494.28] Like if you're like an experiment.
[3494.58 → 3496.70] Like experimental rock.
[3496.82 → 3497.18] Oh.
[3497.42 → 3497.94] Abaca.
[3499.14 → 3499.54] Okay.
[3499.70 → 3499.84] Yeah?
[3499.96 → 3500.18] Someone.
[3500.38 → 3502.10] I want to look up if this is a thing.
[3505.08 → 3506.06] I spelled it wrong.
[3508.62 → 3509.02] Wait.
[3509.12 → 3509.86] Would that actually be it?
[3510.32 → 3511.04] It would be it.
[3511.38 → 3511.74] Aba.
[3512.00 → 3512.40] Abaca.
[3512.50 → 3512.64] Yeah.
[3512.74 → 3513.06] Abaca.
[3513.16 → 3513.30] You got it.
[3513.32 → 3515.16] Abaca NetSuite Consulting.
[3517.36 → 3517.72] Abaca.
[3517.82 → 3518.16] Abaca.
[3518.16 → 3519.60] Search like Abaca band.
[3519.76 → 3521.60] See if there's a band called Abaca already.
[3522.18 → 3523.32] Why don't you just be a nerd band?
[3523.44 → 3524.60] I hope they're experimental rock.
[3526.18 → 3526.44] No.
[3527.48 → 3527.82] Okay.
[3528.06 → 3528.68] Make a band.
[3528.82 → 3529.70] Call it Abaca.
[3530.14 → 3531.30] And play experimental rock.
[3531.42 → 3532.52] Or whatever you want.
[3532.62 → 3533.26] That's all we need.
[3533.82 → 3535.20] Thanks for watching the show this week guys.
[3535.42 → 3538.62] We didn't have a ton of crazy news topics.
[3538.76 → 3541.98] A lot of what was happening in the tech world this week was at NAB.
[3542.28 → 3544.96] With all the cameras and cool software stuff.
[3545.08 → 3547.50] And things that happen at a photo, video, and movie show.
[3547.56 → 3548.76] So I guess follow Brandon on Twitter.
[3548.94 → 3550.18] Follow Brandon on Twitter.
[3551.52 → 3551.92] Wow.
[3552.10 → 3553.68] I don't know his exact handle.
[3553.68 → 3557.28] I think it's Brandon underscore Y underscore Lee.
[3557.46 → 3557.52] Yeah.
[3557.60 → 3557.78] Okay.
[3557.84 → 3558.80] So check him out on Twitter.
[3558.94 → 3560.32] I'm sure he posted stuff in the show.
[3560.32 → 3563.32] Also, I believe we've uploaded some videos recently.
[3564.18 → 3566.80] Well, that's kind of the whole point of this company.
[3566.96 → 3567.54] So, yes.
[3567.72 → 3567.94] Yeah.
[3568.10 → 3568.90] I think we've done that.
[3568.96 → 3572.24] Also, because I forgot to promote my own system.
[3572.88 → 3573.88] Check out Float plane Club.
[3574.04 → 3574.84] You can go to the forum.
[3574.96 → 3577.48] If you go to the forum and look at the buttons on the top of the forum.
[3577.54 → 3578.94] Which I will actually just show you.
[3579.04 → 3580.76] I don't know why I didn't already do that.
[3581.96 → 3587.62] You can go to, if you're signed in, there's a Float plane Club button.
[3587.62 → 3593.20] And if you have Float plane Club, right under here, where it says forum information, right
[3593.20 → 3597.46] in this little area, right before computer hardware, there's a section called Float plane
[3597.46 → 3597.74] Club.
[3598.10 → 3602.50] And you can see all of our non-time sensitive videos one week early.
[3602.66 → 3603.70] And that includes TechWookie.
[3603.78 → 3605.18] We've got some great stuff for you.
[3605.28 → 3611.06] Just today, we posted a video on Float plane featuring this guy in what I think is one of
[3611.06 → 3615.32] the funniest sketches that we've done on TechWookie basically ever.
[3615.56 → 3616.56] That was fun to do.
[3616.56 → 3618.38] We haven't done a ton of sketches on TechWookie.
[3618.64 → 3618.88] Yeah.
[3619.40 → 3622.26] So it was kind of cool to intro a video that way and stuff.
[3622.34 → 3622.50] Yeah.
[3622.60 → 3625.32] It's a piece on the inherent nihilism of modern life.
[3625.38 → 3625.70] Yes.
[3625.82 → 3626.70] But with tech.
[3627.06 → 3627.26] Yeah.
[3627.78 → 3628.56] Which is pretty cool.
[3628.64 → 3628.82] Yeah.
[3628.98 → 3629.10] Check it out.
[3629.10 → 3631.96] So if you want to check that out and tons of other really cool Linus Tech Tip stuff,
[3632.36 → 3635.70] like if you want to be a little preemptive about it because it's not on there yet and
[3635.70 → 3637.82] I do not have a date for you at all.
[3638.38 → 3642.42] If you want to be able to see Scrapyard Wars before everybody else, you can get on Float plane
[3642.42 → 3643.10] Club and see it there.
[3643.20 → 3644.48] Again, I do not have a date.
[3644.84 → 3645.90] It is not on there yet.
[3645.90 → 3648.28] Easel is trying to edit it right now.
[3648.34 → 3648.44] Yeah.
[3648.50 → 3650.30] Like as we speak, I don't know when it's coming out.
[3650.46 → 3650.68] Yeah.
[3650.74 → 3651.36] Not a clue.
[3651.52 → 3652.12] I don't know either.
[3652.40 → 3655.34] I'm not even just not telling you guys.
[3655.42 → 3656.24] I have no clue.
[3656.50 → 3658.48] I don't think our CEO even knows when it's coming out.
[3658.66 → 3660.72] We're all purposefully not asking him.
[3661.16 → 3665.08] I've just been asking him how it's going, not when it's coming out because I don't want
[3665.08 → 3665.12] to know.
[3665.12 → 3666.48] And notice how vague that is.
[3666.56 → 3667.32] How's it going?
[3667.48 → 3668.14] How's it going?
[3668.26 → 3669.26] How are you?
[3669.26 → 3670.54] We give Ewell an out.
[3670.82 → 3671.08] Yeah.
[3671.42 → 3672.10] How are you?
[3672.14 → 3672.68] How are you the viewer?
[3672.84 → 3673.22] How are you?
[3673.26 → 3673.84] How are you, Luke?
[3674.10 → 3674.62] I'm good.
[3674.68 → 3675.32] We're going to end the show.
[3675.52 → 3675.76] Okay.
[3676.48 → 3676.88] Do-do.
[3678.86 → 3680.48] Same time next week, hopefully.
[3681.24 → 3682.44] Well, we're on time this week.
[3683.02 → 3684.38] And Linus will be back next week.
[3684.98 → 3685.68] So, no.
[3685.68 → 3688.96] So, maybe a half an hour later than it started this time.
[3697.40 → 3697.80] Spectrum!
[3699.12 → 3701.40] Those cool glasses that we wore during the show.
[3701.68 → 3703.08] And, like, filter up blue light and stuff.
[3703.84 → 3705.08] Cooler Master and Master Keys!
[3705.80 → 3707.58] Those keyboards that we showed during the show.
[3707.70 → 3710.50] And, like, you can type on them and then stuff will go to your computer.
[3710.98 → 3711.48] How about that?
[3712.36 → 3712.76] Sick!
[3713.40 → 3714.16] That's sick, bro.
[3714.92 → 3715.56] Sick keyboard.
[3715.56 → 3715.78] Sick keyboard, bro.
[3717.14 → 3717.92] Sick board, bro.
[3718.14 → 3719.04] What am I supposed to say?
[3719.52 → 3720.26] Sick keys, bro.
[3720.40 → 3721.04] Sick keys, bro.
[3721.22 → 3722.04] Sick key caps, bro.
[3722.82 → 3723.22] Okay.
[3723.44 → 3724.14] Nice cable, bro.
[3724.44 → 3724.80] Okay.
