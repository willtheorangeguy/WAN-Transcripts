[0.00 --> 5.90]  Live. You can tell at the bottom of the screen all the time.
[5.92 --> 8.00]  It's WAN SHOW TIME!
[8.32 --> 8.80]  Hooray!
[9.56 --> 14.96]  Oh boy. We are late. And for that, we are sorry.
[15.44 --> 16.56]  Only by 19 minutes.
[16.56 --> 17.76]  Only by 19 minutes.
[17.76 --> 17.92]  Or 49.
[18.22 --> 19.76]  Depending how you count it.
[19.86 --> 25.44]  We technically have a new start time, 5 o'clock, but I don't know if we ever officially announced that.
[25.82 --> 28.38]  Colton changed it because we were never on time.
[28.38 --> 36.98]  Anyway, the point is, this time, we were learning, well, I was learning, Luke was showing me, a different streaming software.
[37.26 --> 37.46]  Yeah.
[37.66 --> 41.38]  So this will be the first WAN SHOW streamed on OBS.
[41.88 --> 42.08]  Yeah.
[42.48 --> 49.18]  Not necessarily because we think OBS is unequivocally better than XSplit.
[49.32 --> 49.56]  No.
[50.24 --> 51.30]  Which it isn't.
[51.44 --> 58.08]  But because XSplit has had an utterly game-breaking bug for us for the last couple of weeks,
[58.38 --> 69.62]  that has made it take about half an hour to 45 minutes of extra time after the show to decorruptify the corrupted video output and then upload it to YouTube.
[69.62 --> 71.96]  So it's been kind of a pain in the arse.
[71.96 --> 80.24]  Which has mostly resulted in us, like, downloading the VOD off of Twitch so that we can mess with it.
[80.28 --> 84.36]  Which takes a while because it's an hour-plus long stream sometimes.
[84.56 --> 86.46]  Twitch takes a while to process that.
[86.54 --> 87.26]  Then you have to download it.
[87.26 --> 88.22]  Which all makes sense, to be fair.
[88.22 --> 89.72]  Which all makes sense and is fine.
[90.06 --> 92.58]  It's just a pain in the butt and we don't want to do that anymore.
[92.78 --> 94.80]  So, the WAN SHOW.
[95.02 --> 96.98]  To be very clear, there's pros and cons with both.
[97.06 --> 97.58]  On OBS.
[97.58 --> 97.88]  Yes.
[98.36 --> 100.58]  But, yeah, now we're doing this.
[102.62 --> 104.24]  What else do we have this week?
[104.28 --> 105.62]  Oh, yeah, right, the news.
[106.14 --> 109.44]  So, NVIDIA announced the Titan V.
[111.58 --> 115.90]  And you can have one for the value price of only $3,000.
[116.46 --> 118.52]  We'll talk about what exactly you get for your money.
[119.00 --> 123.40]  AMD and Qualcomm joined forces for always-connected PCs.
[124.04 --> 124.68]  What else we got?
[124.68 --> 126.40]  Nice Hash was breached.
[126.60 --> 129.28]  $64 million of Bitcoin was stolen.
[129.50 --> 131.62]  That valuation is going to constantly change.
[131.78 --> 132.18]  Yeah, that's-
[132.18 --> 134.26]  So, it was about 4,700 coins.
[134.72 --> 137.80]  And, this is in rapid fire, actually, but damn.
[138.40 --> 142.64]  AMD silently lowers Radeon RX 560 specs.
[144.00 --> 145.08]  Wah, wah.
[145.66 --> 145.82]  Woo.
[146.88 --> 150.70]  Start with the interesting news, end with the super bad news.
[150.94 --> 151.48]  All right, hold on.
[151.48 --> 154.48]  I'm updating that nice hash number.
[155.10 --> 157.06]  It was 4,700 coins stolen, right?
[157.06 --> 157.96]  Yeah, roughly, I think.
[158.04 --> 161.38]  So, that is now 76.6 million because Bitcoin has been like,
[161.48 --> 163.50]  woo, wah, lately.
[163.70 --> 164.20]  It does that.
[164.20 --> 165.84]  All right, let's roll that intro, baby.
[167.42 --> 168.64]  Oh, there's no transition.
[171.44 --> 171.52]  Hey.
[172.26 --> 172.80]  The duration.
[173.48 --> 175.02]  100.
[175.48 --> 176.86]  Look at that.
[176.94 --> 177.72]  It was on, baby.
[177.94 --> 178.66]  Look at that, baby.
[178.66 --> 180.42]  I'm like, making changes.
[180.52 --> 180.96]  Yeah, man.
[181.14 --> 181.98]  I've actually used it.
[183.16 --> 184.42]  I really like the audio.
[185.50 --> 187.60]  Yeah, the fact that we can actually see it.
[188.04 --> 189.08]  That part of it.
[189.20 --> 190.12]  Is that the part you like?
[190.30 --> 192.46]  Like, I knew when it started working because I could see it.
[192.96 --> 193.32]  Yeah.
[193.58 --> 194.22]  Oh, oh.
[194.32 --> 195.28]  You like that?
[195.36 --> 195.92]  You like-
[195.92 --> 197.50]  Yeah, you like those indicators, baby?
[197.60 --> 198.16]  I do.
[199.04 --> 200.08]  Show me your indicators.
[200.08 --> 205.28]  I almost made a very specific way too far joke, but no, it's cool.
[205.36 --> 205.92]  Let's move on.
[206.04 --> 206.54]  Titan V.
[207.00 --> 207.26]  Oh, man.
[207.26 --> 209.10]  Yeah, let's talk about the Titan V.
[209.24 --> 211.04]  V is completely unrelated to what we were just talking about.
[211.04 --> 211.60]  So, you know what?
[212.44 --> 217.20]  I've got to give NVIDIA a lot of credit here for doing the right thing with this graphics card.
[217.38 --> 219.14]  This was posted by Max on the support settings.
[219.14 --> 219.80]  Charging three for it.
[219.80 --> 221.40]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[221.40 --> 221.50]  Okay.
[221.90 --> 224.74]  This was posted by Max Settings on the forum.
[227.36 --> 228.84]  And hold on a second.
[229.16 --> 231.54]  And the original article here is from Anantec.
[231.66 --> 237.32]  I think it's kind of neat that Max Settings shared a post about a $3,000 graphics card.
[237.78 --> 240.68]  So, NVIDIA did the right thing here.
[240.68 --> 251.86]  rather than confuse consumers by calling their product iphone x but then 10 nvidia called it
[251.86 --> 258.84]  titan v instead of like titan 5 which incidentally would it is it the fifth titan hold on a second
[258.84 --> 263.88]  now you got the titan you got the titan black i think it's going to depend you've got the titan x
[263.88 --> 270.72]  you've got the titan xp and the xpp and the xpp so no technically it is the sixth titan now if they
[270.72 --> 278.54]  hadn't screwed up and had both a titan xp which was you know what if you count what it actually
[278.54 --> 286.92]  says on the shroud yeah there you go i guess because the titan didn't have the black filled
[286.92 --> 296.24]  in on the titan word the titan black did but it was the same same silver shroud then wait the titan
[296.24 --> 302.28]  you'd have which one had the actual black shroud hold on we might be missing one here
[302.28 --> 313.12]  kepler maxwell pascal titan something titan yeah what was what was a titan what was a titan black
[313.12 --> 316.94]  just titan black which one actually got yeah let's see let's see a picture though uh which one
[316.94 --> 322.28]  actually got like a black shroud no so it was after it was the titan x that got a black shroud
[322.28 --> 332.10]  yes okay okay cool so if we ignore the one that didn't get a p on the end of it the titan x pascal
[332.10 --> 338.18]  which i basically did ignore so i think i could i could stick with that did we make a video for that
[338.18 --> 342.68]  or did we just rant about it i don't think we did yeah i don't think we did so if we agree
[342.68 --> 350.50]  that only graphics cards that we do a review video of count then this is the fifth titan okay
[350.50 --> 359.10]  okay that only we do it we ordered one what a way to yeah i heard yeah wow i uh so i reached out
[359.10 --> 364.06]  to nvidia yo are you guys providing review samples of this thing and they said
[364.06 --> 372.82]  i'm not surprised at all i'm not even remotely they said literally nothing that was the joke
[372.82 --> 378.38]  yeah um and so i'm kind of sitting here going well okay i'm not gonna i'm not gonna wait around
[378.38 --> 383.88]  and find out like titan z i don't count the titan z either we didn't review it
[383.88 --> 392.44]  okay see this is a very convenient definition where if i don't decide that something counts
[392.44 --> 393.38]  it doesn't count
[393.38 --> 401.06]  this is a fun way to live the world live the world live my life it also wasn't a different
[401.06 --> 406.46]  gpu perceive the world interpret the world yeah that's true it was it was two gpus yeah there
[406.46 --> 413.42]  see mind you titan black isn't a different gpu from titan i mean it's just it's just blacker
[413.42 --> 425.10]  and it's not even that much blacker it's just black text so yeah minor details um okay so right what do
[425.10 --> 429.88]  we have to say about the titan v last night i i love that the place they announced it was the nips
[429.88 --> 439.22]  conference because you know this is a pretty hot announcement you know nips anyway um so they
[439.22 --> 446.62]  announced the titan v it has a golden shroud now which is just oh beautiful perfect what were they
[446.62 --> 451.24]  why pick another color thinking like you know it was like a few generations ago that asus did their
[451.24 --> 456.00]  golden stuff so you can take a few generations old board pair it with your new three thousand dollar
[456.00 --> 463.62]  graphics card that was like p67 no it's been more recent than that no yeah no no asus hold on a
[463.62 --> 468.94]  second asus gold board we were making fun of this stuff on the couch at the old house you're drunk
[468.94 --> 475.04]  no no you're drunk yeah but they were old boards by then okay hold on where's that here here's one of
[475.04 --> 484.14]  their stupid gold boards was it okay z87 all right all right all right okay z87 still that's
[484.14 --> 489.56]  how old is that no it's perfect three thousand dollar graphics card that board boom put it
[489.56 --> 496.38]  together best combination i mean what is is this like uh isn't everything kind of going gold these
[496.38 --> 501.60]  days like is this just because of the iphone do i have apple to blame for this a graphic let everybody
[501.60 --> 508.90]  else the entire rest of the computer industry is like okay fine we give up everything's gonna be
[508.90 --> 514.46]  gray scale so black gray or white yeah and we'll put rgb lighting on so everything matches
[514.46 --> 520.18]  everything else maybe that's why actually because a very minor amount i don't like gold but a very
[520.18 --> 524.66]  like i don't know i don't like gold jewelry i don't like whatever but a very minor amount of gold accent
[524.66 --> 533.06]  on something that's like blacked out looks pretty sharp a ginormous graphics card though is not like a
[533.06 --> 537.48]  small gold accent you go with the monochrome computer which is like popular these days
[537.48 --> 544.72]  and then have your black and gold titan yeah well what are we actually going to see is there a picture
[544.72 --> 549.94]  of the backplate uh no because you'll only really see the side and the backplate unless you're going
[549.94 --> 555.20]  with like one of those vertical mount systems which was like i'm gonna i'm gonna assume it's black i'm
[555.20 --> 560.58]  gonna assume it's black this thing looks so it's probably going to be just a minor amount of
[560.58 --> 565.12]  accenting of gold on the side that you're actually i'm gonna have to redo my how to paint your graphics
[565.12 --> 571.14]  card tutorial with the new titan shroud because i can't imagine anyone you should get happy with it
[571.14 --> 576.22]  like real silver paint can you get that is that a thing i'm sure that's a thing
[576.22 --> 583.20]  sounds like poisonous or something i don't know it probably is all right um so anyway what else can
[583.20 --> 589.36]  we say about this thing available for purchase today three grand so that's almost four thousand
[589.36 --> 600.48]  canadian rupees um which sucks but like realistically so nvidia's policy on cards that are not intended
[600.48 --> 607.96]  for gamers is that they don't generally cede them to gaming press but gaming press wants to know how
[607.96 --> 615.84]  this thing performs for games and other things gamers want to know how this thing performs in games
[615.84 --> 622.30]  so the way that we see it we're kind of taking one for the team here we absolutely have to get one
[622.30 --> 627.36]  and run some games on it and see how it goes from there because the specs on this thing are ridiculous
[627.36 --> 633.64]  this is the same gpu as the tesla v100 which is apparently a ten thousand dollar graphics card
[633.64 --> 637.66]  so really we should all stop complaining because you're getting a seven thousand dollar discount
[637.66 --> 640.72]  beautiful no no no complaints here give me four
[640.72 --> 645.98]  this is targeted at machine learning scientists who want to simply install the card in their desktop
[645.98 --> 652.78]  pcs and not rely on a special server or storage or networking uh so it keeps the titan branding as
[652.78 --> 661.60]  opposed to geforce titan um and it'll have massive memory bandwidth yes it's using hbm2 memory 12
[661.60 --> 669.74]  12 gigs freaking gigs of it that's a lot and it has uh what is this of hbm2 to be clear 110
[669.74 --> 677.56]  it says dl in here but i'm sure that means dual precision um teraflops so that's nine times oh deep
[677.56 --> 682.44]  learning teraflops sorry that's nine times the deep learning computing horsepower of its predecessor
[682.44 --> 689.86]  1455 megahertz boost clock this is a massive 815 millimeter square die i believe this was the largest
[689.86 --> 695.68]  of all time like single monolithic die i don't remember if it actually was but it is it is very
[695.68 --> 706.62]  close 80 sms did i already say 5 120 cuda course holy crap so one said four titan v sli for compensator
[706.62 --> 714.44]  uh no no so that's really interesting link sli at all um so so this is so the previous titan xp was
[714.44 --> 721.36]  3840 cuda course so this is a new architecture this is volta and it has many many more cuda
[721.36 --> 728.30]  cores and uh it has envy link connectors at the top but this was actually a developing story right as we
[728.30 --> 732.48]  were starting the wan show uh there's a thread over on the linus tech tips forum where people are
[732.48 --> 737.76]  talking about this apparently nvidia has come out and said it not only does not support sli because it
[737.76 --> 744.60]  doesn't have sli fingers yeah it does not support envy link oh so the fingers are there but envy link
[744.60 --> 749.58]  is i guess considered to be a data center feature and not something that you would need in a single
[749.58 --> 760.52]  system so nvidia is coming right out and making dual card configurations for gaming and then also for
[760.52 --> 764.90]  uh to be clear it doesn't matter how they market this people are going to use it for gaming
[764.90 --> 769.94]  yeah so now dual card configurations will still work for some workloads like something like solid
[769.94 --> 775.56]  works doesn't require envy link or an sli connector you can just have more gpus in and it'll just use
[775.56 --> 780.78]  more compute um but where the cards need to communicate with each other not having envy link
[780.78 --> 786.38]  will be a disadvantage and for gaming they're just like nope you know last generation two generations
[786.38 --> 790.84]  ago we took away three-way and four-way on this stuff now we're taking away two-way this is just
[790.84 --> 792.66]  one card per system boom done
[792.66 --> 798.40]  vapor chamber cooler 16 power phases 250 watt tdp
[798.40 --> 800.92]  and uh wow
[800.92 --> 808.08]  it gets the gv100's full unrestricted fp64 compute and tensor core performance
[808.08 --> 813.24]  and the only real thing that differentiates it from tesla is memory capacity memory bandwidth
[813.24 --> 817.10]  and the lack of envy link functionality it uses the standard geforce driver stack
[817.10 --> 826.08]  freaking cool huh okay well i'm excited to see how this goes and we'll let you know as soon as it
[826.08 --> 832.60]  arrives there is no gaming information at all anywhere on the titan v page this is not like what
[832.60 --> 837.58]  nvidia has done in the past where they've gone like titan uh titan z was a perfect example of this
[837.58 --> 842.96]  where they're like this thing is was it that one three grand too i think so titan z was really
[842.96 --> 849.12]  expensive like this thing is thousands of dollars because it's a professional product not for gamers
[849.12 --> 854.32]  and then you'd go on like three grand yeah retailer websites you'd go on ncix or new egg or whatever
[854.32 --> 861.14]  and there'd be banner ads using like nvidia assets that are like titan z the ultimate gaming performance
[861.14 --> 868.58]  it's like okay is it or is it not well this one there is absolutely nothing in there about gaming
[868.58 --> 874.56]  i don't see a single thing that's cool because it's cool because if they want this to be the
[874.56 --> 879.52]  non-gaming thing that they keep on saying that they are well original titan was supposed to be
[879.52 --> 884.64]  yeah so this is just kind of coming back to its roots a little bit yeah because it strayed pretty
[884.64 --> 892.02]  hard um all right amd and qualcomm this was posted on the forum by username the linus portal i don't know
[892.02 --> 897.74]  what a linus portal is um i'm gonna try not to be weirded out by it i'm sure it's i'm sure it's hey it might
[897.74 --> 902.66]  not be your portal it might be a different line it could be a different linus um that gets confusing
[902.66 --> 908.36]  when working on flowplane anyway the original post here was from engadget boop amd and qualcomm
[908.36 --> 916.20]  join forces to power higher end connected pcs so they're going up against intel's e-sim compatible
[916.20 --> 924.56]  systems so in a nutshell uh they're teaming up to make always connected pcs on amd's ryzen mobile
[924.56 --> 930.18]  platform uh using snapdragon lte modems to enable gigabit connection speeds
[930.18 --> 939.06]  okay so apparently the pair of the processor and this like always connected chip will make it so
[939.06 --> 944.74]  you can play something like league of legends anywhere without wi-fi yeah okay i mean this is
[944.74 --> 948.88]  actually something we were talking about like just last week on the wan show yeah yeah i mean
[948.88 --> 954.48]  more connectivity for these devices that now i mean a device like the lg gram the last generation
[954.48 --> 958.08]  one not the one with the eighth gen processor that one's battery life is not as much but
[958.08 --> 965.54]  something like a last gen lg gram is getting nine plus hours in like a battery life test and in real
[965.54 --> 972.54]  usage can get well over that like sometimes 10 even 12 hours um so having a device like that just be
[972.54 --> 978.26]  able to be connected literally all the time is obviously desirable so and you could theoretically
[978.26 --> 984.58]  have a laptop that was more performance it wasn't the performance of the laptop that was hampering
[984.58 --> 988.64]  the game you could play it's just this chip in particular that we're talking about so you could
[988.64 --> 994.96]  get a higher end laptop that also has this snapdragon x16 lte modem and would be able to game other
[994.96 --> 1000.78]  things just on that power of the system probably going to be plugged in so we have our first all amd
[1000.78 --> 1007.12]  laptop like not of all time like i probably at some point like eight years ago of modern era like
[1007.12 --> 1013.84]  linus tech tips covered one like i don't remember it though it's a long time ago um so asus sent us
[1013.84 --> 1019.40]  over a gaming laptop that's got polaris gpu and a ryzen cpu so we're gonna be checking that out pretty
[1019.40 --> 1025.12]  soon cool amd is finally relevant in laptops again or maybe they're not i don't know we haven't tested
[1025.12 --> 1029.50]  it yet but there are they got design wins and that's a lot more than they could say over the last
[1029.50 --> 1039.98]  couple of years oh boy so um i lost about 300 okay okay i'll say that uh the original article
[1039.98 --> 1047.78]  here is from reuters which i will confess i did not know how this was pronounced until like less than a
[1047.78 --> 1054.08]  year ago i thought it was like reuters reuters i could see that and like whenever i heard people
[1054.08 --> 1060.84]  say reuters like just kind of you know on the periphery i thought they were talking about like
[1060.84 --> 1069.40]  steroids like i never like that close attention that's funny i don't think i've ever attempted to
[1069.40 --> 1077.76]  pronounce it like with no pre-knowledge yeah i heard the name before i read the name yeah well
[1077.76 --> 1082.58]  you know what whatever i've had enough of your i've had enough of your comments twitch chat which i
[1082.58 --> 1087.44]  don't even have to look at the twitch chat to know that i'm getting like skinned alive over there yeah
[1087.44 --> 1093.88]  so nice hash which this puts me in a bit of an awkward position because
[1093.88 --> 1100.12]  we didn't go as far as to recommend it oh i didn't even think about this in our recent video
[1100.12 --> 1109.30]  part one of our bitcoin slash cryptocurrency mining exploration but we did show it we did talk about
[1109.30 --> 1116.72]  what the service does and it was cool and we were using it yeah which means that when they got hacked
[1116.72 --> 1124.82]  earlier this week we lost about 300 bucks but i'm not going to complain because the total amount
[1124.82 --> 1131.60]  of money lost is tens of millions of dollars the headline is 64 million because that's based on
[1131.60 --> 1137.28]  what the value was right around the time that this news broke but it went up last night was huge
[1137.28 --> 1143.34]  i believe was the last night or the night before um it was uh yesterday morning or like yesterday
[1143.34 --> 1148.44]  yesterday your early morning i think it spiked up to like 1800 or something like that it was crazy
[1148.44 --> 1152.84]  i thought it was i was at a shoot do you mean early morning as in like two in the morning um
[1152.84 --> 1159.98]  well i don't know i was at a shoot and it was like 11 a.m my time 10 a.m my time okay so it was
[1159.98 --> 1165.88]  like whenever it was very recent that it spiked up and the value of this came down yeah and even now
[1165.88 --> 1172.94]  it's like 10 million more yeah about than it was when it first happened so this isn't the first time
[1172.94 --> 1178.96]  this has happened there's been so in this one in particular there's about 4 700 coins stolen bitcoin
[1178.96 --> 1188.94]  stolen uh in in all there's been 980 000 bitcoins that have been stolen from exchanges alone that
[1188.94 --> 1194.64]  total is worth more than 15 billion dollars at current exchange rates and that is when they calculated
[1194.64 --> 1201.80]  before so it's actually worth more now so here's the thing that we should probably do because
[1201.80 --> 1207.58]  um there's okay oh great so there's been at least three dozen of these thefts on digital currency
[1207.58 --> 1214.18]  exchanges since 2011 uh including the one that led to the collapse of mount gox which was the largest
[1214.18 --> 1222.14]  bitcoin exchange at the time um so what i'm kind of thinking is everyone who wants to get into bitcoin
[1222.14 --> 1230.36]  seems to figure out how to buy it or how to mine it and then i feel like it's really easy to get lazy
[1230.36 --> 1235.40]  about the other stuff you want to get into like cold storage and how to store it how to dump it
[1235.40 --> 1244.04]  because the literally the only way to be 100 certain that your bitcoin will not be vulnerable to a hack
[1244.04 --> 1250.94]  is to store it completely offline whether that's a hardware wallet yep or whether that's a cold computer
[1250.94 --> 1257.34]  by by that i mean like a computer that's not on a network yeah so some people will even go as far
[1257.34 --> 1265.68]  as to store handwritten notes in safety deposit boxes in a bank in traditional banks yeah and i think
[1265.68 --> 1271.28]  that's really something that is worth discussing because a lot of people are going into this whole
[1271.28 --> 1279.06]  bitcoin slash altcoin cryptocurrency thing thinking that once they google a little bit and they find you
[1279.06 --> 1286.20]  know who the reputable exchanges are or the reputable wallets are uh once they find that they've got the
[1286.20 --> 1292.88]  equivalent of a bank's type of security and to be clear if banks are not perfect either by the way
[1292.88 --> 1300.44]  but in traditional finance usually if a bank gets heisted depends depends how much money is in the
[1300.44 --> 1308.06]  account for example um yeah i don't know all the details i just know i've had forever ago my like
[1308.06 --> 1312.24]  debit card got ripped off yeah and a few thousand dollars where the transactions went through it
[1312.24 --> 1317.54]  and i got my money back pretty quick so that is heavily dependent on your account your financial
[1317.54 --> 1322.44]  institution you use a credit union which back then may have actually been an advantage but maybe no
[1322.44 --> 1328.24]  longer is oh we could talk about it more offline anyway the point is people google around they find
[1328.24 --> 1333.00]  something that looks reputable yeah you know everyone on reddit upvoted or whatever else and then
[1333.00 --> 1341.58]  they kind of go okay yeah my money is safe there but in truth there is so much more to it and like
[1341.58 --> 1349.62]  as much fun as it is to buy some bitcoin at 70 71 50 is i think what i got in at a little while ago and i
[1349.62 --> 1353.50]  had always i had i had abstained for the longest time and finally i was just like you know what forget
[1353.50 --> 1359.86]  it i'm just gonna i'm gonna buy some um as much as much fun as it is to look at that and go
[1359.86 --> 1366.20]  woo i doubled my money over the last three weeks which i did and i'm feeling pretty good about it
[1366.20 --> 1371.64]  unless you actually know how to get it out and convert it into a fiat currency right now with
[1371.64 --> 1376.58]  the volatility of bitcoin and for that matter cryptocurrency in general people are gonna
[1376.58 --> 1381.42]  be pissed that we're saying this but like even just looking at at charts and stuff it is so it's
[1381.42 --> 1386.66]  not even just necessarily volatile because volatile means that it dies right no it means it varies
[1386.66 --> 1393.32]  okay yeah so it is extremely freaking volatile it's extremely volatile and to me currency is not
[1393.32 --> 1400.76]  currency unless it can be exchanged for goods and services and right now you cannot buy a car
[1400.76 --> 1405.68]  with bitcoin at the local dealer there's yeah there's gonna be like some person yeah there's
[1405.68 --> 1412.20]  gonna be some dealership somewhere i don't care that is not the point the point is that if you wanted
[1412.20 --> 1420.84]  it let's say let's say i bought um uh a thousand dollars of bitcoin and it went up 10x and all of a
[1420.84 --> 1428.10]  sudden i had ten thousand dollars i wanted to go to like joe's used auto auto lot or whatever and i was
[1428.10 --> 1435.94]  like yo i invested a thousand dollars in bitcoin i'm gonna buy a car i cannot do that unless i cash out
[1435.94 --> 1443.94]  today so that's what i mean when i say as much fun as it is to have this money until you can actually
[1443.94 --> 1449.32]  exchange it for goods and services it's just paper and i kind of slurred my words there which was funny
[1449.32 --> 1458.14]  because i kind of said surfaces you could buy surfaces if you whatever you're into cars surfaces razor blades
[1458.14 --> 1464.26]  i don't care um so i mean is that something that we should be starting to maybe do like a maybe make
[1464.26 --> 1470.30]  part of that multi-part bitcoin series that we're working on like so looking into videos online about this
[1470.30 --> 1477.30]  kind of stuff one of the least documented processes is wallets and storage of your coins
[1477.30 --> 1483.02]  and one of the most important parts about it is wallets and storage of your coins and when this nice
[1483.02 --> 1486.76]  hash thing happens people weren't saying because you're talking about the bitcoin community right so
[1486.76 --> 1490.22]  people weren't coming at it from the angle you were which is like you need to bring it into fiat
[1490.22 --> 1494.22]  currencies uh people were going at it from the angle of you need to secure your
[1494.22 --> 1500.18]  bitcoin people don't understand okay lol i'm a ducky is paypal currency then or not
[1500.18 --> 1507.44]  yes because it's in a real currency it's just stored with paypal bitcoin is a real currency
[1507.44 --> 1514.16]  and by real i mean fiat currency i mean a recognized currency so yeah anyway go ahead
[1514.16 --> 1518.90]  and to be clear on the volatile thing i looked it up it does have a negative connotation sure it can
[1518.90 --> 1521.74]  have whatever connotation it wants but that doesn't change that it's very volatile
[1521.74 --> 1528.34]  it is but it's going up so volatile is like apparently not entirely volatile is specifically
[1528.34 --> 1536.10]  a negative thing okay so erratic in a bad way which it is it can it has mostly been erratic in a good
[1536.10 --> 1541.18]  way yes um except when it's not except when it's not which does happen and you might get screwed on a
[1541.18 --> 1548.00]  trade because it might go but like so far holding has been a very good strategy like someone bought
[1548.00 --> 1553.70]  real estate with it recently right we actually specifically said that yes someone somewhere
[1553.70 --> 1560.94]  is taking it but there's coffee shops that take it there's there's websites that take it uh we're
[1560.94 --> 1566.42]  looking into trying to take it for float plane subscriptions uh it's a thing there's there's
[1566.42 --> 1572.24]  certain areas there's a cruise that you go on that you can go on that you pay for with bitcoin and i
[1572.24 --> 1576.58]  think all the transactions while you're on the cruise are done in bitcoin there's some stuff but
[1576.58 --> 1584.88]  it would be it's not it's not the norm um is what we're trying to say yeah so essentially um
[1584.88 --> 1591.54]  taking it out of bitcoin putting into usd is a generally safer way to deal with it but your usd
[1591.54 --> 1595.86]  can still get stolen everything can still get stolen that's kind of an important thing to understand
[1595.86 --> 1600.68]  but stuff like cold wallets holding your storage and offline computers different types of wallets
[1600.68 --> 1605.64]  using hardware wallets all this kind of stuff isn't as well documented as most other things in
[1605.64 --> 1611.10]  the bitcoin world and when something like this nice hash thing happens all the smug commenters are
[1611.10 --> 1616.26]  going yeah well you shouldn't have it in a hardware wallet or an offline wallet like and most people
[1616.26 --> 1622.76]  responding are like what is that how do you do that yeah and there there is some resources on it but
[1622.76 --> 1630.54]  not a ton um yeah yeah well let's uh we'll have a look at that we'll figure out a plan i think part
[1630.54 --> 1637.62]  two is going to be i don't know the more optimized mining machine so that's mostly done um we actually
[1637.62 --> 1644.70]  would have had the motherboard today but it got sent to north carolina for some reason yeah long story
[1644.70 --> 1650.72]  okay um or connecticut i don't know it was a us something and it had a c in it so okay yeah it was
[1650.72 --> 1655.06]  a city or a state and it had a c at the beginning of one of them it wasn't california i know that much
[1655.06 --> 1662.48]  anyway um so so we would have had asus's 19 gpu board even though we're not actually going to be
[1662.48 --> 1670.10]  using all 19 slots so the reason for that get this is in order to run 19 why well bitcoin what do you
[1670.10 --> 1676.06]  think no i but but even for bitcoin why would you get that board um because then you don't have to
[1676.06 --> 1680.70]  have more boards and more ram sticks and more cpus how expensive is that board 200 bucks
[1680.70 --> 1688.56]  yeah not too bad yeah so you save your because i mean the the cheapest the cheapest cpu is like 40
[1688.56 --> 1694.26]  bucks from intel anyway but are you putting them all next to each other no the way that it works is you
[1694.26 --> 1700.48]  use uh use extenders yeah yeah yeah so the slots are it's it's like this thing's hilarious i'll bring
[1700.48 --> 1707.56]  it up i haven't seen it the b250 mining expert oh it's literally okay i thought you were just buying
[1707.56 --> 1714.14]  some like crazy server board no it's like dude no no no no this is like this is oh lol yeah look at
[1714.14 --> 1722.22]  this thing it's ridiculous there's all the slots it's like stupid um that's amazing so anyway the funny
[1722.22 --> 1729.70]  thing about it is that in order to actually use all 19 six of them have to be nvidia's gp106 based
[1729.70 --> 1737.20]  mining specific card okay exactly six i think like the manual for this thing is hilarious because
[1737.20 --> 1743.76]  check out these oh my god i just saw that so these power like different slots and there's like a
[1743.76 --> 1748.94]  whole diagram and stuff and then there's like this diagram for like what types of cards you can
[1748.94 --> 1754.48]  install in what ratios in what slots in order to actually populate all 19 of them so these guys
[1754.48 --> 1759.68]  have to come off the same power supply as this one in case you were wondering and don't
[1759.68 --> 1764.64]  quote me on that i looked at the manual like a couple hours ago actually there's two two ram slots
[1764.64 --> 1771.54]  two ram slots um oh yeah so we've got one of those i'm even surprised there's four sata ports
[1771.54 --> 1776.94]  uh yeah yeah what would you need that for i would have expected got a usb3 header
[1776.94 --> 1784.94]  i would have expected two or one yeah yeah so so yeah so that's going to be part two uh part three
[1784.94 --> 1789.70]  we're going to take a look at asic miners and then maybe part four we'll start to get into storage
[1789.70 --> 1796.28]  um how to sell uh maybe like a part five it would be cool to take a look at some of the tools that
[1796.28 --> 1803.58]  people are using like kraken to not just like google uh not not just like googling what's the usd to
[1803.58 --> 1809.14]  bitcoin conversion but like kraken has been terrible but yeah okay but some there's a lot of different
[1809.14 --> 1813.04]  tools that people are using taking a look at a handful of them and kind of going okay well here's some
[1813.04 --> 1818.58]  of the advantages and drawbacks of each of them yeah um yeah i mean i i think i think it would be
[1818.58 --> 1822.34]  something that would be very beneficial to the community at large like kraken's charts are super
[1822.34 --> 1827.68]  nice and really rapidly updated yeah which is like half the time the site doesn't work well that's a
[1827.68 --> 1834.48]  problem which is you know a pro and con yes and these are the kinds of conversations that we want to
[1834.48 --> 1841.04]  have yeah speaking of conversations we want to have let's talk about uh oh i think i think
[1841.04 --> 1847.54]  yeah so you don't drag stuff i know i realize that okay so i want to talk about that we actually
[1847.54 --> 1854.00]  thought for the longest time that we still don't know that well we thought and we might still think
[1854.00 --> 1859.14]  we might not be sure what we think okay but we thought that you weren't allowed to show
[1859.14 --> 1865.98]  mad nips on twitch are we doing it so i'm gonna find out oh once and for all hold on i'm gonna find out
[1865.98 --> 1873.38]  because we actually like fairly regularly have twitch staff watching our stream so we're doing
[1873.38 --> 1881.32]  our mac weldon spot today no no no we are going now normally luke jumps in with the hands and covers
[1881.32 --> 1887.18]  the nips yeah and to be clear i'm not going to do anything sexual because that's clearly in their
[1887.18 --> 1892.14]  terms of service which i have wondered about okay because if there's a girl on stream yeah and some
[1892.14 --> 1899.36]  dude puts his hands in front and it doesn't show her nips i bet you that would still be
[1899.36 --> 1904.16]  bannable even though that's exactly what we did just with two what if he hasn't like an eight inch
[1904.16 --> 1908.76]  or like a 12 inch buffer because that's often what i yeah like yeah like a 12 inch buffer like
[1908.76 --> 1915.86]  clearly this yeah could be sexual yeah but maybe this isn't you know maybe okay so here it goes
[1915.86 --> 1923.48]  are we gonna get banned oh oh no oh oh they're gone okay okay sorry uh uh apologies headphone users
[1923.48 --> 1931.04]  um because that was probably terrible i didn't see any staff in chat oh oh what's going on now
[1931.04 --> 1936.04]  no no no that was that was unrelated oh i thought i thought the page actually like disappeared i was
[1936.04 --> 1943.28]  like whoa that freaked me out we broke the twitch net uh okay so mac weldon makers of the shirts that
[1943.28 --> 1948.50]  we're wearing believes in smart design premium fabrics and simple shopping um mac weldon makes
[1948.50 --> 1953.26]  super comfortable clothes whether it's underwear socks shirts undershirts hoodies or sweatpants
[1953.26 --> 1960.10]  and this is awesome they have a line of silver underwear and shirts that are naturally antimicrobial
[1960.10 --> 1964.42]  which and very comfortable i'm not gonna i'm not gonna get judgy okay you know i'm not saying
[1964.42 --> 1969.60]  anything about you know our audience and you know or like twitch in general and what are the odds that
[1969.60 --> 1975.62]  you might benefit from an antimicrobial shirt see we're not going there but antimicrobial means
[1975.62 --> 1980.84]  that it'll help eliminate odor and if you've ever been to a land party i'm not going to generalize but
[1980.84 --> 1985.52]  i will say that there are certain people you'll find someone at any land party who should probably
[1985.52 --> 1988.98]  be wearing an antimicrobial shirt it's gotten a little bit better over there that's what i'll say
[1988.98 --> 1994.74]  yeah that's what i'll say um so they want you to be comfortable and not smell and if you don't like
[1994.74 --> 2000.16]  your first pair you can keep them and they will still refund you no questions asked so go check
[2000.16 --> 2008.72]  them out at mac weldon.com and get 20 off your mac weldon purchases at genie.us slash small d small v
[2008.72 --> 2014.34]  big g big y big i or small l i don't know which it is so i'm going to paste it in the twitch chat
[2014.34 --> 2018.88]  slash it'll be under the video and you guys can click it because that's a better way to handle that
[2018.88 --> 2024.36]  the twitch chat right now is fantastic oh are they are they are they upset about me oh no they're just
[2024.36 --> 2028.70]  they're just making jokes about it oh excellent good i'm never sure if i'm gonna make people mad
[2028.70 --> 2035.18]  when i'm like what i yeah because here's the thing is like the the culture today is one of not being
[2035.18 --> 2042.48]  able to say things that are true sometimes and like i'd like to think that most gamers like back
[2042.48 --> 2048.80]  when i was going to lands and you're there for like sometimes 48 hours at a time nobody leaves so you
[2048.80 --> 2052.40]  clearly haven't showered in two days and you've been sitting at your computer and here's the thing
[2052.40 --> 2060.16]  when you're gaming when competitively gaming the odds of you sweating in a stinky way are actually
[2060.16 --> 2066.66]  higher than if you were working out because stress sweat stinks more than exercise sweat
[2066.66 --> 2075.10]  so you're sitting there gaming you're like stressed out for two days you're probably gonna smell and
[2075.10 --> 2084.24]  i mean i'm not some people forget i'll say forget some people are bound to forget their deodorant that
[2084.24 --> 2091.30]  they definitely do own so but you never know like sometimes your mom bought it for you for christmas
[2091.30 --> 2095.10]  people are gonna get upset about these things and it's just like you never know what you can what
[2095.10 --> 2100.48]  you can actually say or not i'm gonna sideline us for a quick second yeah okay all right this is where
[2100.48 --> 2106.04]  i don't know because we are in a little bit of like outragey kind of culture yeah yeah sure but
[2106.04 --> 2113.38]  then we're also getting older yeah so is this like the old people say offensive things kind of
[2113.38 --> 2121.26]  situation man like are we becoming the racist grandpa exactly except about like people who smell
[2121.26 --> 2128.04]  yeah like totally different category of stuff yeah but is that part of what's happening are people who
[2128.04 --> 2134.64]  smell becoming a subculture that you can't discriminate against maybe because here's the thing
[2134.64 --> 2142.44]  all sniffs are equal i'm not going to name any names but we had a situation at linus media group
[2142.44 --> 2146.78]  where i had to speak to an employee about his or her hygiene
[2146.78 --> 2153.78]  and i'm really not going to name any names i'm not going to give any hints it was me
[2153.78 --> 2160.16]  no it wasn't it oh i thought it was me oh no that was pajamas yeah that was a separate issue that was
[2160.16 --> 2165.42]  professionalism slash i've probably given you crap about being sweaty at some time or another but
[2165.42 --> 2170.48]  but no i'm not gonna i'm not gonna say who it was wow i don't even know who this is okay no because
[2170.48 --> 2175.06]  that's because it's private well you did a good job yeah thank you um so i actually did have to
[2175.06 --> 2182.18]  speak to an employee about hygiene at one point and i really wasn't sure how to do it because
[2182.18 --> 2189.74]  is that discriminatory it's a difficult yeah because it's a difficult thing to approach they weren't
[2189.74 --> 2195.92]  they weren't showing up like in a in a like an indecent garb like they weren't showing up in a in a
[2195.92 --> 2200.40]  thong and no pants like something that's like clearly you know sexually inappropriate like
[2200.40 --> 2209.76]  just smelled bad yeah and um and so i can i can tell you my solution um in a way that will make
[2209.76 --> 2216.08]  it very difficult for you to track down who it would have been okay okay but at some point in our process
[2216.08 --> 2225.48]  of doing annual reviews i added a field about professionalism and about maintaining appropriate
[2225.48 --> 2233.60]  personal hygiene for the sake of the comfort in the workplace of your colleagues because i do know
[2233.60 --> 2239.48]  about that field because i've been in there because i wore pajamas to work that was the professionalism
[2239.48 --> 2248.72]  overall yeah yeah and so um by the way yes shorts yeah the shorts i've never cared about the shorts have
[2248.72 --> 2256.66]  never bothered me it was it was when you would literally like roll out of bed go to work and be like
[2256.66 --> 2264.60]  wearing a shirt that's like stained and like pj pants that are ripped to hell like to the point where
[2264.60 --> 2270.74]  yeah to the point where it was a little indecent yeah so every single pair of pajamas that i have
[2270.74 --> 2275.44]  has a hole in the crotch so anyway i'm buying new pajamas so so so these are things that i've actually
[2275.44 --> 2283.02]  had to worry about like am i being the the the the the anti-deodorantist you know grandpa yeah it's
[2283.02 --> 2290.12]  like you shouldn't smell bad who knows that's like i'm running into these situations where that is a
[2290.12 --> 2295.22]  cultural thing like there's people who are anti anything that's unnatural shaving deodorant that
[2295.22 --> 2301.22]  kind of thing and uh you know maybe i'm crossing a you know a personal boundary by being like yo
[2301.22 --> 2311.36]  you smell in a manner that is my discomfort level is about here right now you know yeah i have no i
[2311.36 --> 2316.92]  have no idea so there you go anyways next sponsor they're like no this is irrelevant old people don't
[2316.92 --> 2322.22]  care about bad smell which is you know what no i'm not going to get into it because maybe
[2322.22 --> 2325.80]  some of the best like groomed people that i know
[2326.72 --> 2332.60]  are older people yeah some of and i think it gets to a certain point where it becomes
[2332.60 --> 2338.20]  it becomes it's not that they don't care i think well okay some of them probably don't care
[2338.20 --> 2343.78]  like some people okay so there's two things there's actually a number of factors here i think some people
[2343.78 --> 2349.40]  get old and give zero f's about anything yes and they're just like yolo also i'm close to the end of
[2349.40 --> 2354.02]  it so i'm just not going to stress about this stuff other people get to the point where they
[2354.02 --> 2358.34]  like can't really care for themselves properly anymore and like that makes them unhappy actually
[2358.34 --> 2365.40]  or it would be extremely tedious to do so so um steve jobs apparently didn't shower i do know that that
[2365.40 --> 2370.16]  is a thing like not showering and letting your body's natural flora like take care of itself
[2370.16 --> 2376.82]  is apparently theoretically a thing um i haven't actually like smelled someone what do you do about
[2376.82 --> 2383.28]  grime in that case i don't know like a like what if you get dirty like a file you know
[2383.28 --> 2390.32]  scrape it off i don't know but that's like that's my thing do i smell like i know how this works
[2390.32 --> 2397.78]  uh not that kind i guess you smell fine you smell neutral there's no there's no like yeah
[2397.78 --> 2404.02]  i didn't actually notice any smell difference if i can walk into the room and nobody notices i consider
[2404.02 --> 2410.30]  that optimal yeah um okay okay sorry let's let's jump into our next thing um savage jerky i'm going
[2410.30 --> 2414.98]  for delicious jerky this week yeah it's already i'm going for the moho that is so nice you had the
[2414.98 --> 2423.98]  moho ready for me i did out of the box yeah so savage jerky was created with the intent of making a
[2423.98 --> 2429.68]  delicious snack that is also not bad for you so it's made without nitrates or preservatives
[2429.68 --> 2438.18]  and they've got 15 i said 15 13 different flavors of jerky some of our favorites are the moho and the
[2438.18 --> 2444.94]  uh the maple the maple bacon i love the maple bacon um also the traditional is really really good and
[2444.94 --> 2449.64]  then if you're the kind of person who's into the melt your face off jerky i'm like salivating just
[2449.64 --> 2455.62]  looking at this it happens every week for me then um they've got carolina reaper like ghost pepper
[2455.62 --> 2461.52]  jerky and then because they're experts in making your face melt off with peppers they've also got
[2461.52 --> 2468.78]  hot sauces and barbecue sauces and a spice rub if you're pretty into spice but don't want to face
[2468.78 --> 2475.34]  melt i would recommend moho habanero that's a good one so use offer code ltt to save 10 over at

[2549.78 --> 2554.64]  something i am going to go up really fast i am going to confess that i had never heard of this before
[2554.64 --> 2561.82]  before this moment right now i have oh okay cool yeah i'm i'm gonna go get it because i only have
[2561.82 --> 2567.68]  one browser extension installed right now so i don't have like a super loaded up browser yeah yeah
[2567.68 --> 2575.88]  so that seems like a that seems like a pretty good one i have four i think not a crazy amount all right
[2575.88 --> 2581.46]  got a couple more topics here there's a leaked intel sorry full plane at some point yes there's a
[2581.46 --> 2586.92]  leaked intel roadmap um it's on wccf tech so you take it with a grain of salt this was posted on the
[2586.92 --> 2596.86]  forum by numlock 21 and apparently um intel cascade lake x is confirmed for hedt it'll be arriving on x299
[2596.86 --> 2605.52]  slash lga 2066 in late 2018 so none of this is surprising at all uh because that's what intel does
[2605.52 --> 2610.30]  every generation they launch a new chipset with cpus then they do a cpu refresh then you get a new
[2610.30 --> 2618.48]  chipset then you get not c okay um also this is groundbreaking news coffee lake x s s not x will
[2618.48 --> 2622.36]  apparently get dual core processors and there will be more processor updates in 2018 along with
[2622.36 --> 2631.32]  z390 and b360 chipsets okay blah blah blah blah blah blah blah no mention of eight core processors so
[2631.32 --> 2638.72]  those have been rumored and uh gemini lake goes in n series processors features 10 watt tdp and four
[2638.72 --> 2643.42]  slash two core variants so these are 14 nanometer goldmont cores and those are apparently coming in
[2643.42 --> 2649.22]  the 52nd week of 2018 so end of next year okay neat now let's talk about stuff that's coming a little
[2649.22 --> 2654.18]  bit sooner this is by post posted by aluminium tech on the forum and the original article here is from
[2654.18 --> 2667.04]  qualcomm.com they've got a new cpu coming what wall the 845 mobile platform um yeah your next phone
[2667.04 --> 2674.44]  your next phone will have one of these unless you buy a phone right now yeah and then or like a cheaper
[2674.44 --> 2681.72]  one or an iphone and it will be a little bit better um
[2681.72 --> 2690.68]  how much better you say 25 to 35 percent faster than current snapdragon 835
[2690.68 --> 2697.88]  it can apparently record 480 fps video at 720p or 240 fps at 1080 that's pretty cool mind you
[2697.88 --> 2705.90]  light most phones absolutely kill their image quality yeah when you're recording at high frame
[2705.90 --> 2715.84]  rates so even though it is 1920 pixels by 1080 pixels it looks blocky and like trash yeah so
[2715.84 --> 2724.16]  yeah although the 25 to 30 percent faster thing is going to be interesting to check out because uh
[2724.16 --> 2730.74]  yeah this is the first qualcomm soc to have a secure processing unit so this is a new subsystem to
[2730.74 --> 2736.36]  protect data like your fingerprints iris mobile payments sim and more that's interesting but it's
[2736.36 --> 2743.60]  probably like super cracked already why would it be if it stores everything locally um yeah but there's
[2744.36 --> 2751.44]  i mean apple's had a fair bit of success to get their name right now uh american government thing
[2751.44 --> 2759.90]  oh i have the fcc in my head that's obviously not it yeah the um nsa nsa has nsa tools or whatever
[2759.90 --> 2765.46]  and those have leaked repeatedly and considering how delayed this is compared to apples i wouldn't be
[2765.46 --> 2771.84]  surprised if it was like developed in cohorts with them i know it's like tinfoil hattie but these things
[2771.84 --> 2781.70]  keep coming true so i don't know and those uh nsa tools keep leaking so like random pirate groups keep
[2781.70 --> 2787.84]  getting access to them and then it's super not secure so i don't know i i wouldn't absolutely trust it but
[2787.84 --> 2797.88]  hey cool uh in other news this was originally posted on anantech.com amd has apparently silently
[2797.88 --> 2811.24]  lowered the spec of their rx 560 yeah um to basically a previous generation's spec
[2811.24 --> 2819.68]  update an amd statement given to our sister site tom's hardware confirms the two rx 560 variants
[2819.68 --> 2826.10]  and amd also noted that aib partners so like sapphire msi asus etc would be responsible for
[2826.10 --> 2835.38]  communicating a given rx 560 model's specifications wow so you can either get 14 compute units or 16
[2835.38 --> 2844.76]  compute units buying an rx 560 this is trash and amd should feel terrible and they should not do this
[2844.76 --> 2855.18]  so with an rx 560 let's go with the 14 compute unit model you can get 14 cus and 896 sps now comparing
[2855.18 --> 2863.44]  to an rx 460 which has 14 cus and 896 sps one of the big reasons why people are pissed off is because
[2863.44 --> 2864.66]  it's essentially a 460
[2864.66 --> 2874.08]  like if you want to sell slightly disabled 560s with less ram why don't you just sell 460s
[2874.08 --> 2880.46]  how complicated is that yeah wow it's polaris 11
[2880.46 --> 2889.12]  like honestly it's the last time like this is not the first time for amd like i don't know if you know this
[2889.12 --> 2898.04]  but i still remember one of the most pissed off that i have ever been about a technology purchase
[2898.04 --> 2903.32]  was when i bought a sapphire radeon 9600 non-pro
[2903.32 --> 2910.48]  and this was back like almost 15 years ago like back when that was a somewhat respectable card but
[2910.48 --> 2917.50]  nearing the end of its life cycle so it was like a it was like a value gaming card so i already had
[2917.50 --> 2922.66]  my own gaming rig but i was upgrading my parents computer so that my siblings could play like sims or
[2922.66 --> 2932.28]  whatever and what happened was sapphire called the card radio i ended up on the phone for literally
[2932.28 --> 2941.56]  hours with both sapphire and amd support over this when i found out that this 9600 and in this case it
[2941.56 --> 2947.86]  was not marked in any way on the box that this 9600 was different from a normal 9600 when this 9600
[2947.86 --> 2955.30]  had i forget what the difference was i think it had um a narrower memory bus or something like that
[2955.30 --> 2963.02]  like it had a like a 64 versus a 128 bit bus or something along those lines and there were no specs
[2963.02 --> 2968.98]  online other than the specific product page for this sapphire card which was like hard to find on their site
[2968.98 --> 2972.92]  that made it clear that it was not a normal 9600
[2972.92 --> 2983.78]  i thought we were past this i don't really get why tech companies feel the need to rebadge especially
[2983.78 --> 2990.06]  in this manner when they already had a product that they could have just sold as this now there are some
[2990.06 --> 2997.04]  differences the new one compared to the 460 can go down to a lower tdp so as low as 60 watts versus
[2997.04 --> 3002.72]  approximately 75 watts and it's available with just two gigs of ram instead of just being a four
[3002.72 --> 3008.90]  gig part but i feel like it would have been a lot less misleading to just call this a two gig
[3008.90 --> 3012.18]  460 and just make it available
[3012.18 --> 3022.66]  especially because like in in their update statement to be clear they said we're working with all uh we're
[3022.66 --> 3027.02]  taking immediate steps to remedy to this we're working with all add-in board and channel partners
[3027.02 --> 3033.56]  to make sure product descriptions and names clarify the cu count so the gamers consumers know exactly
[3033.56 --> 3037.54]  what they're buying that's not going to work we apologize for the confusion this may have caused
[3037.54 --> 3042.38]  that was intentional that's bs the reason why it's not going to work is the vast majority of consumers
[3042.38 --> 3049.36]  don't know what a freaking cu is yeah of course not they're looking at a model number or model names all
[3049.36 --> 3053.44]  they had to do and they've even done stuff like this in the past all they had to do if they were going to
[3053.44 --> 3060.74]  do a cut down one is call it le or xl or something along those lines like there are something there's
[3060.74 --> 3067.80]  plenty of precedent that already exists for how to do this properly and they just decided not to
[3067.80 --> 3073.60]  this is really bad for amd because amd was very much in the for the people yeah they're supposed to
[3073.60 --> 3078.88]  be like you know the good guy underdog like that's their brand image that they project the last like
[3078.88 --> 3083.84]  major controversy that i know of on what this scale should be but this doesn't seem to be blowing
[3083.84 --> 3088.78]  up as much probably because not an insane amount of people are buying 560s and a lot more people had
[3088.78 --> 3096.88]  purchased 970s was the ram issue on 970s that was the last big time that it was like this is essentially
[3096.88 --> 3106.66]  being lied about yeah all right um not good man sneaky deaky stuff not cool what else we got here
[3106.66 --> 3114.12]  um oh yeah sure why not oh steam no longer accepts bitcoin oh um i actually didn't even know that they
[3114.12 --> 3118.80]  accepted bitcoin as payment didn't the original poster here was vegetable stew we'll go ahead and pull up
[3118.80 --> 3127.58]  uh okay so first of all anyone who was giving me crap about using the word volatile to describe
[3127.58 --> 3133.08]  bitcoin you can go ahead and give uh valve a bunch of crap for it too because there's all the instances
[3133.08 --> 3138.54]  of volatile or volatility in the first three paragraphs of their statement on why they are no
[3138.54 --> 3143.58]  longer i don't think it's completely invalid to use it's just going to trigger some people yeah so
[3143.58 --> 3148.78]  yeah there you go so go ahead and get triggered by valve too um i actually yeah i had no idea
[3148.78 --> 3153.24]  that they didn't accept it so when they first added bitcoin as a method of payment transaction fees
[3153.24 --> 3159.00]  were as low as 20 cents now they've crept up as high as 20 dollars per transaction
[3159.00 --> 3163.74]  these fees are passed on to the consumer and they result in unreasonably high costs for games
[3163.74 --> 3168.80]  also the value of bitcoin is only guaranteed for a certain period of time so if the transaction
[3168.80 --> 3173.74]  doesn't complete within that window the amount of bitcoin needed to cover the transaction can change
[3173.74 --> 3178.64]  um well the normal solution is either to refund the original payment or the user
[3178.64 --> 3183.48]  or ask the user to transfer additional funds but both in both of these cases the users hit with
[3183.48 --> 3189.46]  the transaction fee again not to mention that this is like a customer service overhead nightmare for
[3189.46 --> 3195.50]  any retailer retailer they've said they'll reevaluate it at a later date and i don't blame them at all
[3195.50 --> 3202.28]  with all of that said are we planning to support bitcoin on flowplane we want to and what are the
[3202.28 --> 3207.64]  obstacles right now you can if you can talk about it so okay the main obstacles right now to be
[3207.64 --> 3214.18]  completely honest is everything else essentially is a higher priority the site's not up uh payments
[3214.18 --> 3221.78]  for the current payment system on the forum is atrocious um and we need payments for credit card
[3221.78 --> 3228.74]  to work and we need the new implementation for payments for paypal which will be braintree to work
[3228.74 --> 3235.54]  and i want essentially i want the mvp of the site to be up i want people to be using the proper domain
[3235.54 --> 3240.40]  not going through the forum i want all that other kind of stuff done and then we'll look into supporting
[3240.40 --> 3247.62]  bitcoin but there is going to be more issues once we start doing that um how do we deal with fraud
[3247.62 --> 3256.32]  okay i literally don't know like on bitcoin you mean yeah right i have no clue yeah that's fine
[3256.32 --> 3260.84]  got it like what if there's fraudulent transactions there's no i can't go contact someone's bank
[3260.84 --> 3268.52]  contacting the it's their wallet like i can't do anything like that um i'm not entirely sure how
[3268.52 --> 3273.60]  refunds work i think we would be on the hook for the transaction fee for refunds right where with most
[3273.60 --> 3279.02]  services yeah you get a refund of the transaction fee yeah and if that's if it's a twenty dollar
[3279.02 --> 3284.00]  transaction fee that could drive us under pretty fast if uh yeah like there is a lot of potential
[3284.00 --> 3288.54]  issues we're going to look into it i haven't looked into any of those issues yeah i don't know
[3288.54 --> 3293.46]  so it might be solutions yeah maybe i don't know it's just not very high on the priority tier we just
[3293.46 --> 3299.58]  need to know can i do this maybe no can i try i would really prefer not they're literally working on
[3299.58 --> 3310.28]  it right now is it worth a shot come on let's try it you only live once whoa what's that okay i want
[3310.28 --> 3316.26]  to put a giant disclaimer here last time a whole bunch of people signed up for floatplane um on the
[3316.26 --> 3322.54]  forum and paid for their access and then were very upset when they couldn't log into this site to access
[3322.54 --> 3329.60]  it yes um just like last time this is not the site that is working right now at all to access
[3329.60 --> 3335.06]  floatplane it's the front page of the forum and then if you are subscribed it is at the top of the
[3335.06 --> 3340.14]  forum there's a floatplane section yeah i'm not logged in yet right now but uh that that's normally
[3340.14 --> 3346.26]  how you access it yeah but uh you know i mean hey come on you only live you only live once right baby
[3346.26 --> 3358.34]  uh oh that's weird um i i don't i didn't uh did uh the who oh uh when did that happen can you use
[3358.34 --> 3365.74]  your thing no why i don't know can i um that thing's being used by swedish bros for development oh um
[3365.74 --> 3373.40]  okay so now what uh i can make you one dang it dang it why are you why are you what is this what
[3373.40 --> 3379.48]  what are you doing well i i i um uh uh just use your account on here usually do that and then just
[3379.48 --> 3387.66]  cover it with the camera right uh no i usually use the other one oh yeah uh okay well uh do it do a
[3387.66 --> 3392.40]  news topic okay or we can switch and i can set up a different account that you can use no it's fine
[3392.40 --> 3396.20]  just uh just do a news topic in the meantime i got this all right all right all right give me a sec
[3396.20 --> 3401.98]  so it's not in the doc but you might even be able to talk about this while you're covering that
[3401.98 --> 3408.32]  um and nick has a link for me apparently apple is acquiring the music recognition app shazam
[3408.32 --> 3414.50]  interesting um i actually did already read about this uh apparently it's some amount less than a
[3414.50 --> 3420.26]  billion dollars so that's good if you're apple i guess because i don't know if i would pay a billion
[3420.26 --> 3426.46]  dollars for shazam but um i mean i don't know if this is reactionary or if this is something that
[3426.46 --> 3430.50]  they already had planned but this definitely helps apple address um google's implementation
[3430.50 --> 3436.58]  on the pixel on the pixel 2 rather anyway where the device is always listening to music around you
[3436.58 --> 3441.90]  as creepy as that is um and will just display passively on the screen of your phone
[3441.90 --> 3452.96]  what um what song is playing so other than helping siri better recognize songs i don't really know what
[3452.96 --> 3458.56]  the benefit of this is for apple but it goes to show you that they are they are sure willing to spend
[3458.56 --> 3465.78]  a lot of money to have it be slightly easier to find out what song and also i guess you could have
[3465.78 --> 3474.56]  just used shazam but not do that for a billion dollars less than a billion dollars yeah um
[3474.56 --> 3481.78]  so yeah what oh okay why are you why are you trying to show that well i wanted i wanted to i
[3481.78 --> 3487.32]  wanted to try it well i was gonna link it to the other one and then i was gonna like go through and
[3487.32 --> 3494.04]  i was gonna use it oh but yeah there's nothing to use right now oh but like the videos aren't there yet
[3494.04 --> 3500.70]  no oh okay i thought they were no okay so we're making that part just work for live streaming
[3500.70 --> 3507.42]  oh oh right live streaming is gonna be a thing soon yeah yeah all right so right now on floatplane
[3507.42 --> 3513.30]  uh we've got the porsche design just make sure that you're covering up i know i got it we've got
[3513.30 --> 3520.32]  the porsche design book one see look i'm driving a laptop oh i actually didn't put that together right
[3520.32 --> 3530.00]  away oh oh my goodness we've got our review of the aero 15x this is a thin and light with a gtx 1070
[3530.00 --> 3535.70]  wow it's pretty impressive actually and they managed to do it with the touchpad in not a stupid
[3535.70 --> 3541.16]  location does it can we can we get a little spoiler does it throttle um it's really good okay yeah it's
[3541.16 --> 3548.78]  like really impressive um we finally yeah pretty much every laptop throttles under combined load though
[3548.78 --> 3556.06]  yeah yeah so we finally released our video on vega frontier edition the teaser for this is amazing
[3556.06 --> 3564.50]  yeah this is this was a freaking saga uh brendan's smartphone camera showdown which we promised in
[3564.50 --> 3570.00]  the next week or two after whatever video i was recording when i was like yo brendan why don't you
[3570.00 --> 3576.10]  do your smartphone camera showdown is finally up on floatplane so he compares the iphone 8 plus with
[3576.10 --> 3581.80]  the note 8 with the v30 with the pixel 2 xl so we don't have the iphone 10 in there but my
[3581.80 --> 3588.24]  understanding is a is that it is a pretty similar camera to the iphone 8 plus so i'm not too worried
[3588.24 --> 3598.56]  about it um we've got the eve v uh the crowdsourced surface competitor and then uh i don't think this
[3598.56 --> 3604.30]  handy tech has made it onto uh youtube yet either handy tech old is new again so we've actually got a
[3604.30 --> 3608.44]  lot of stuff on there including a couple tech quickies uh does overclocking void your warranty for
[3608.44 --> 3613.06]  example so if you cannot wait to find out then you can sign up for floatplane where you'll get
