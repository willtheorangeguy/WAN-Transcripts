[0.00 → 2.44] Boom.
[2.86 → 3.20] Alright.
[3.98 → 5.36] We did it, Colton.
[8.74 → 9.74] We did it.
[10.22 → 11.22] We made it happen.
[11.62 → 13.38] 4.30, we're live.
[13.62 → 14.68] Oh my God.
[14.70 → 15.10] Boom.
[15.32 → 15.72] Yes.
[15.90 → 16.32] Yes.
[16.80 → 17.24] Congratulations.
[17.36 → 17.88] Roll intro.
[18.18 → 18.72] Just do it.
[30.00 → 59.98] We did it.
[60.00 → 62.52] Being on time was the most exciting thing to happen to me this week.
[63.52 → 64.64] That was amazing.
[64.92 → 68.08] Being on time was not at all the most exciting thing that happened to me this week, unfortunately.
[68.38 → 68.80] I'm sorry.
[69.36 → 70.34] Scrapyard Wars, man.
[73.46 → 74.04] Scrapyard Wars.
[74.06 → 75.60] Scrapyard Wars was sick.
[76.28 → 78.48] Linus, who isn't here, thinks that it might...
[78.48 → 79.24] Thank you, Taryn.
[79.40 → 79.60] Oh.
[80.04 → 80.60] I didn't see that.
[80.66 → 80.90] Oh, man.
[83.34 → 85.92] Linus thinks that it might be the best season yet.
[86.14 → 90.36] I'm not sure because season four was pretty freaking amazing.
[90.76 → 92.14] That was the one with Bob and Rod.
[92.38 → 92.58] Yeah.
[92.90 → 96.08] But we'll see because it was very good.
[96.16 → 97.78] The ending was really intense.
[98.24 → 103.12] Some really crazy things happened, but I'm going to try to not spoil any of it because
[103.12 → 104.60] it was just so damn good.
[105.76 → 106.94] What did you do all week?
[107.94 → 109.62] I wrote the fastest possible scripts.
[109.92 → 110.28] Fantastic.
[110.72 → 111.56] I did my job.
[111.64 → 112.42] I read one of them.
[112.42 → 112.52] That's what I did.
[112.68 → 113.10] I think.
[113.60 → 114.66] It was perfect.
[114.82 → 115.08] Okay.
[115.20 → 115.62] There we go.
[115.70 → 117.16] I did my job perfect.
[117.22 → 118.88] Should we spoiler the title?
[119.48 → 121.12] The one that you...
[121.12 → 121.70] Which one?
[121.74 → 122.62] The one that you read today?
[122.98 → 123.30] Or...
[123.30 → 124.26] I read two of them today, yeah.
[125.00 → 125.36] Oh.
[125.76 → 126.76] Nah, let's make a whiteboard.
[126.76 → 126.92] Okay.
[127.10 → 127.24] Yeah.
[127.36 → 127.56] Get ready.
[127.58 → 128.14] Go be good, though.
[128.74 → 130.52] John is not a merciful god.
[131.82 → 132.44] Oh, no.
[134.54 → 135.06] Oh, no.
[135.36 → 135.82] Oh, no.
[135.90 → 136.20] Oh, no.
[136.20 → 136.84] Oh, no.
[137.56 → 137.98] Oh, no.
[138.06 → 139.86] Do you want to look onto mine?
[140.10 → 140.46] What?
[141.24 → 142.14] That sucks a lot.
[142.16 → 145.04] Do you want to do that while I read the first topic?
[145.74 → 147.70] Sort of, but I can't show it on my...
[147.70 → 149.08] Yes, I can show it on my screen.
[149.20 → 149.56] Oh, crap.
[149.66 → 149.94] Okay.
[150.16 → 151.64] I'm just going to go ahead and get started then.
[153.02 → 158.10] Reddit.com, the Build a PC Subreddit, got Linus eyes today.
[158.60 → 158.94] Yes.
[158.98 → 160.46] As you can probably say...
[160.46 → 160.80] Oh, no.
[160.92 → 161.74] That's being covered up.
[161.84 → 162.56] There we go.
[162.56 → 162.62] There we go.
[162.74 → 162.92] Yes.
[163.20 → 164.08] Dynamic scenes.
[164.08 → 169.56] So, Linus was made into a deity with some of our usual sponsors on his robes, as you
[169.56 → 169.96] can see.
[170.28 → 170.88] So epic.
[171.32 → 176.38] And this was funny because there was a sticky announcement discouraging April Fool's pranks
[176.38 → 177.12] on the forum.
[177.44 → 177.62] Yes.
[177.62 → 178.92] And then this happened.
[179.52 → 180.70] So, there you go.
[181.12 → 181.94] You can see it right there.
[183.10 → 185.64] I appreciated the sidebar add-in.
[185.82 → 187.70] If we scroll down and go see the sidebar.
[189.66 → 195.28] This Subreddit is a community dedicated to our one true god, Linus, crossed out Torvalds,
[195.44 → 196.00] Sebastian.
[196.54 → 199.64] And then in brackets, Luke fans also welcome here.
[199.64 → 202.56] So, if he's the one true god, what would that make you?
[203.54 → 205.18] Well, it's three parts, right?
[205.72 → 206.98] Oh, so you're talking Christian Trinity.
[207.28 → 209.92] So, there's like Gabon, Linus, Sebastian.
[210.18 → 216.06] Or wait, I guess in this weird situation, because usually Gabon is the original, but that's fine.
[216.12 → 216.62] Keep talking.
[218.38 → 220.86] Gabon, Linus, Sebastian, me, I guess.
[220.98 → 221.34] Okay, there we go.
[221.34 → 222.94] Is what they're displaying in this situation.
[223.30 → 223.56] Okay.
[223.62 → 227.28] Usually, I think I'm not included, but that's fine.
[227.44 → 228.24] How sad for you.
[228.24 → 228.52] Yeah.
[228.66 → 228.90] Okay.
[229.14 → 229.34] Yeah.
[230.10 → 232.06] The hot Canadian thing as well.
[232.14 → 233.22] The hot Canadian thing.
[233.34 → 233.96] That's fantastic.
[234.20 → 234.52] Yeah.
[234.76 → 236.08] Okay, let's find that real quick.
[236.58 → 241.24] So, it even shows in the top corner as the underscore Linus, which I find funny.
[241.62 → 243.54] But yeah, top thread right now, hot Canadian.
[243.72 → 247.32] If you vote this up, this image will show when you Google search hot Canadian.
[247.48 → 253.16] If you click on it, it's like Linus at CES like a while ago, I think.
[253.16 → 253.60] Struggling.
[253.78 → 255.74] He'll move our feet out of the way.
[255.74 → 255.94] Oh, yeah.
[256.04 → 256.48] Good call.
[256.48 → 258.28] Wow, that was not what I intended to do.
[259.12 → 259.52] What?
[259.62 → 260.04] Oh, no.
[260.50 → 260.96] Oh, no.
[261.48 → 262.32] Split's crashing.
[262.52 → 264.26] Split is doing bad things to us.
[264.26 → 264.46] Oh.
[265.02 → 265.98] I can fix it.
[266.54 → 267.70] We have the technology.
[267.80 → 268.16] Good job.
[269.30 → 270.18] It's still lagging.
[270.20 → 270.78] Okay, we've got it.
[270.82 → 272.36] We're going to float in the middle of the screen for a sec.
[272.72 → 273.16] Sounds good.
[273.62 → 273.96] I'm down.
[275.46 → 275.86] Nope.
[276.20 → 277.92] It switched which source is which.
[277.92 → 278.10] What?
[278.10 → 279.90] That is so weird.
[280.06 → 282.76] I'm moving the wrong source, but it's like working.
[283.02 → 283.46] Anyway.
[283.70 → 283.88] Cool.
[284.02 → 284.52] There we go.
[285.00 → 285.64] That was funny.
[286.24 → 287.94] Anyway, that's basically it.
[288.12 → 296.28] I think there's also one other April Fool's out that wasn't ours, which was Corsair's?
[296.38 → 297.20] I didn't even see that one.
[297.20 → 297.88] No, Nvidia's.
[297.88 → 298.20] I did not even see it.
[298.20 → 299.28] Is Nvidia's actually live?
[299.72 → 301.70] Let me take off my scene for a second.
[301.70 → 306.28] This one was hilarious.
[306.28 → 307.42] It's April Fool's in England.
[308.76 → 309.46] G-Assist.
[309.52 → 310.40] Passed midnight there, I believe.
[310.40 → 310.76] Yeah.
[310.98 → 311.96] So this is live.
[312.12 → 312.30] Okay.
[313.30 → 314.60] So GeForce G-Assist.
[314.70 → 316.74] You can see the video playing in the background right now.
[316.84 → 317.98] I'm going to move us again.
[319.72 → 321.82] It does a lot of different stuff.
[321.82 → 327.66] They're saying that the GeForce GTX G-Assist takes advantage of cutting-edge Nvidia artificial
[327.66 → 331.04] intelligence technology to bring the next revolution in gaming.
[331.70 → 333.12] Stay in the game.
[333.20 → 341.44] So you can eat in a Rainbow Six Siege match, and it'll play for you is part of the idea.
[341.62 → 347.52] It's kind of like that old urban legend about the dude that bought the RV, and he thought
[347.52 → 349.16] the cruise control meant to drive itself.
[349.16 → 353.62] So he went back to do his business, and bad things happened.
[353.84 → 354.62] Bad things happened, yeah.
[355.34 → 356.24] Crush your enemies.
[356.38 → 357.74] It'll play for you.
[358.72 → 359.90] Sorry, boss boost.
[360.10 → 361.22] That part will play for you.
[361.22 → 365.56] The NV Nurture will tell you when you need to drink more energy drinks or whatever.
[366.48 → 368.54] Just, ugh, it is ridiculous.
[369.16 → 370.28] This thing was pretty cool.
[370.64 → 372.18] And it's just like a little flash drive.
[372.76 → 377.50] I think we've all been at the point, at a point, to be fair, where we've had to be told
[377.50 → 378.48] to drink energy drinks.
[379.56 → 380.00] Really?
[381.00 → 383.02] When have you been told to drink energy drinks?
[383.26 → 383.86] No comment.
[383.86 → 386.08] Oh, jeez.
[387.02 → 387.38] Okay.
[387.54 → 391.84] I need to fix this thing really quick, which is actually going to be a huge issue.
[392.44 → 393.58] Yeah, why is it doing that?
[393.70 → 394.60] Did that just happen again?
[394.60 → 395.48] I don't know why it did that.
[395.82 → 397.50] Well, I didn't fix it the first time.
[397.50 → 399.88] Do you want to talk about the YouTube ad thing?
[400.04 → 400.24] Sure.
[400.48 → 400.74] Okay.
[401.16 → 405.88] So, while Luke gets his horrible login issues fixed, next topic.
[406.12 → 409.12] YouTube's response to advertiser flight costs creators.
[409.92 → 413.84] Hundreds of brands froze spending on YouTube after it was revealed that ads were appearing
[413.84 → 417.34] alongside objectionable and even terrorist-backed videos.
[417.34 → 417.78] Yeah.
[418.00 → 420.82] So, this is not just limited to YouTube.
[421.48 → 427.08] Apparently, companies like Walmart and Pepsi, so some pretty heavy hitters, they said they're
[427.08 → 431.54] not going to buy ads anymore that Google places on third-party websites.
[432.16 → 435.84] And Verizon has also said that it was going to suspend all digital advertising not related
[435.84 → 436.36] to search.
[437.12 → 439.88] So, obviously, Google wants to try to do something about this.
[439.98 → 445.16] And so, there are new filters that are now on YouTube that advertisers can apply to campaigns
[445.16 → 449.54] that will help them avoid several types of quote-unquote objectionable content.
[450.54 → 456.68] So, there used to just be two filter categories that if you were putting an ad on YouTube that
[456.68 → 457.30] you could exclude.
[457.74 → 462.72] One was called sensitive social issues and the other was called tragedy and conflicts.
[463.02 → 468.38] But there's now three more, including sexually suggestive, sensational, and shocking, while
[468.38 → 471.70] that's all of S-words, and profanity and rough language.
[471.90 → 474.64] And I'm doing the quotes because that's exactly how it's written on my screen.
[475.16 → 477.82] So, that's a little bit.
[478.64 → 480.24] Obviously, there's some gray area there.
[481.52 → 486.98] So, reportedly, some channels that just touch on somewhat sensitive or slightly offensive
[486.98 → 488.92] topics are being impacted by this.
[489.90 → 496.40] Ruben Report, H3H3, Ethan, if you know him, Stephen Crowder, who's a conservative talk show
[496.40 → 498.30] host, and several others.
[498.54 → 500.40] So, what are your thoughts on this, Luke?
[500.40 → 501.70] I don't know.
[501.88 → 504.12] I, like, it's, it's not...
[505.16 → 510.56] It gets, it gets a little messy because, like, we're in the space.
[510.64 → 515.40] I feel like it would be a lot easier for me to comment on it if it wasn't, like, our platform
[515.40 → 519.08] that we use and, like, are going to put this video on eventually.
[519.08 → 523.80] And the announcement is up, like, right now for this stream on YouTube.
[524.12 → 525.18] Like, I don't know.
[526.80 → 528.90] It's, it's a mixture of things.
[529.02 → 534.56] I can completely understand the companies that do not want to advertise on terrorist-backed
[534.56 → 535.36] YouTube channels.
[535.36 → 540.24] I can completely understand the companies that do not want their products associated
[540.24 → 542.78] with certain types of content.
[543.34 → 548.82] And I can completely understand YouTube making systems so that they do not have to have their
[548.82 → 550.08] ads on certain types of content.
[550.44 → 556.10] There is a reason why really late night TV shows, like, shows that are on at, like, one
[556.10 → 559.60] or two in the morning, get the like, crazy ads.
[559.80 → 564.02] Because the other shows probably would not even necessarily want to be associated with
[564.02 → 564.54] those ads.
[564.54 → 566.56] It's, like, it goes both ways to a certain degree.
[566.56 → 566.78] Yeah.
[566.86 → 567.40] Like, well, yeah.
[567.50 → 571.58] On, like, traditional TV, if you want to take out an ad spot, you would know, like,
[571.64 → 573.04] oh, here's what this show is.
[573.10 → 574.16] Here's, like, the show's rating.
[574.18 → 576.30] You would buy an ad spot on the Super Bowl.
[576.46 → 576.80] Exactly.
[576.80 → 578.18] And it would go on the Super Bowl.
[578.36 → 579.90] And you know what's going to happen.
[580.14 → 580.50] Football.
[580.76 → 580.96] Yeah.
[580.96 → 583.12] Except for that one incident with Janet Jackson.
[583.12 → 585.42] But other than that, like, you know what you're getting.
[585.74 → 587.18] But, like, that was an issue.
[587.40 → 593.80] And, like, that's, knowing what content your ad is going to go on matters.
[593.80 → 599.06] Now, the issue with it is how the filter works.
[599.72 → 599.98] Yeah.
[600.26 → 605.36] And what channels are completely innocent and get flagged and therefore make tons of
[605.36 → 605.92] less money.
[606.20 → 608.08] At the same time, it's YouTube.
[608.30 → 609.52] This isn't, like, a government thing.
[609.60 → 610.68] They can do whatever they want.
[610.80 → 610.94] Right.
[610.94 → 612.64] YouTube could kill AdSense tomorrow.
[612.80 → 613.28] Yeah.
[613.70 → 614.82] It would suck.
[614.82 → 614.98] Yeah.
[615.08 → 619.92] There are no obligation, at least for now, like, to offer it just to all comers, you know.
[620.08 → 625.34] And obviously this gets into, like, the age-old question of, oh, who gets to decide what's
[625.34 → 626.22] okay and what's not.
[626.38 → 626.98] Like, obviously.
[627.34 → 628.14] That's the scary part.
[628.20 → 628.32] Yeah.
[628.36 → 632.14] And obviously, you know, oh, if there's, like, an ISIS recruitment video or something,
[632.24 → 634.02] then, yes, don't advertise on that.
[634.10 → 635.48] That's a little bit more cut and dry.
[635.48 → 639.34] But, like, for example, I mentioned Steven Crowder a minute ago.
[639.56 → 644.60] And according to Mr. Crowder, he was saying that his channel is being targeted by this,
[644.78 → 648.84] but he's saying that liberal commentary channels are not.
[649.26 → 653.92] And regardless of where you fall on the political spectrum, and if any of you guys follow me on
[653.92 → 655.88] Twitter, you might know I have a policy.
[656.02 → 658.12] I don't tweet, like, what my personal political views are.
[658.22 → 659.76] I just, that's just something I don't want to do.
[659.76 → 665.54] But regardless of what side of the aisle you're on, there are a lot of commentators,
[665.84 → 669.60] both conservative and liberal, that have an abrasive style.
[669.84 → 670.88] And that's part of, like, their shtick.
[671.36 → 672.52] And like you said, both sides.
[672.68 → 673.00] Exactly.
[673.56 → 678.28] Like, Crowder's a conservative guy who part of his whole deal is I'm going to come off as
[678.28 → 678.70] abrasive.
[678.76 → 679.90] I think my viewers will like it.
[679.94 → 682.44] But there are folks on the left wing that do this, too.
[682.56 → 687.70] So what he's saying is true, then, you know, you have to start wondering where do we draw
[687.70 → 689.94] this line as far as being objectionable?
[690.10 → 694.92] And outside just concerns about fairness, you also think about, oh, if you're an advertiser
[694.92 → 700.56] and where do the advertisers draw the line, when would they say, oh, we're not happy about
[700.56 → 701.70] getting our videos excluded?
[702.48 → 703.66] Like, where do you find that balance?
[704.34 → 705.90] Yeah, that's difficult to do.
[706.02 → 711.70] And then there's the case for H3H3, where they're, like, a comedy-focused style channel.
[711.70 → 718.58] And for them to get excluded is scary for people in comedy because it brings up the whole, like,
[718.64 → 722.04] one thing that I actually thought of while I was sitting here was I brought up the like,
[722.08 → 723.28] late-night TV show idea.
[723.82 → 726.88] South Park, doesn't that show at, like, very normal times?
[727.76 → 729.94] I think it's, I could be wrong about this.
[730.02 → 733.66] I think it's now slightly earlier than it used to be.
[733.72 → 736.26] Maybe some of you guys in the chat who are South Park fans can tell us.
[736.26 → 736.98] But I believe—
[736.98 → 737.92] I don't have TV yet.
[738.10 → 738.36] Yeah.
[738.56 → 744.18] It used to be on, like, I think 10 p.m. Eastern on Comedy Central in the U.S.
[744.24 → 745.36] So that's pretty late.
[745.58 → 745.76] Yeah.
[745.88 → 750.72] It might be earlier now because when it first came out, you know, people's sensitivities
[750.72 → 751.40] were a little bit different.
[751.42 → 751.44] It was really racy.
[751.44 → 754.78] It was like, oh, my God, this is, like, so—well, it's not even that it's gotten, like, less
[754.78 → 755.20] racy.
[755.30 → 758.50] It's just more that people seem to, like, not care as much now.
[758.52 → 758.70] Yeah.
[758.70 → 760.62] Because back then it was like, oh, my God, this is, like, so shocking.
[760.76 → 762.92] And nowadays, it's just like, oh, South Park, whatever.
[763.12 → 763.34] Yeah.
[763.54 → 763.72] Yeah.
[763.72 → 764.48] I don't know.
[764.48 → 771.40] It's—for comedy, it's an issue because there's the like, if anything can be made
[771.40 → 774.50] fun of, everything should be able to be made fun of kind of ideology.
[774.54 → 776.30] Which is funny because they brought that up on South Park.
[776.38 → 777.62] It's either all okay or none of it is.
[777.64 → 777.90] Yeah.
[778.30 → 778.66] Exactly.
[778.80 → 781.52] And, like, I usually kind of go in that camp.
[781.78 → 784.86] But then as an advertiser, I can see why you might not want to.
[785.16 → 786.78] And where do you draw the lines?
[786.82 → 788.90] Are all comedians in that bucket?
[789.08 → 792.58] Do you have comedy as a bucket and not all ads go on comedy?
[792.58 → 795.10] Or is it, like, different types of comedy?
[795.36 → 797.50] If, yeah, it's—
[797.50 → 802.34] Ultimately, I think it kind of comes down to the fact that a lot of people who aren't, like,
[802.40 → 805.60] technophiles will be watching a YouTube video they might not like.
[805.64 → 809.90] They see an ad coming up, and they don't understand, like, oh, here's how YouTube AdSense works.
[810.32 → 813.86] The videos are just kind of put randomly on other videos.
[814.04 → 816.82] The advertisers don't get a lot of say as to what they go on.
[816.82 → 819.32] But people don't realize this, and they'll start screaming anyway.
[819.46 → 821.88] And I can—so I can see why that would be a problem for advertisers.
[822.28 → 824.18] I sort of wish people just didn't care.
[826.24 → 828.76] Like, I feel like that would just be a lot easier for everyone.
[828.92 → 829.08] Sure.
[829.14 → 832.24] I wish people would stop aggressively screeching about things, too.
[832.28 → 833.82] But I also want to toilet me the solid gold.
[834.02 → 834.64] So, yeah.
[834.80 → 835.18] I'm not going to have it.
[835.46 → 835.62] Yeah.
[837.58 → 838.40] I don't know.
[838.40 → 843.30] I'm—I just wish it didn't matter so much.
[843.42 → 848.44] Like, I—and I could totally see that one person who sends an email to whatever company
[848.44 → 853.34] because they're like, oh, I mis clicked on this video, and it's against my views and I saw your ad on it
[853.34 → 855.32] so I hate you, and I'm never going to buy your products again.
[855.50 → 856.80] But, like, just settle down.
[856.94 → 857.22] Exactly.
[857.46 → 859.34] Extremely quick aside because I know we have to move on.
[859.50 → 865.40] If you ever go onto the FCC's website, they have a section for public comment.
[865.40 → 870.12] And usually it's for people who are kind of at least familiar with FCC regulations and the law
[870.12 → 874.48] and they kind of give a somewhat informed opinion on stuff they're thinking about doing.
[874.86 → 879.84] But if you look at the stuff that specifically relates to, like, decency and content or whatever,
[880.20 → 886.94] it's just full of the most, like, aggressive people who, like, clearly know nothing about how it works.
[887.04 → 889.66] Like, this sort of content is so bad.
[889.72 → 890.48] Get it off my TV.
[890.60 → 891.16] So, yeah.
[891.26 → 892.70] And there's a lot of people like that.
[892.98 → 893.40] So, yeah.
[893.40 → 896.22] Apparently there used to be two filter categories.
[896.40 → 897.06] Sensitive subject.
[897.26 → 898.10] Oh, I went over this already.
[898.60 → 898.96] Oh, okay.
[898.96 → 900.26] Did you talk about the new ones?
[900.42 → 900.92] Yes, I did.
[901.12 → 901.46] Yeah, okay.
[901.58 → 901.70] Yeah.
[902.16 → 903.62] YouTube has two statements.
[903.72 → 904.34] Did you mention those?
[905.30 → 905.78] No.
[905.78 → 909.46] They said there's a difference between the free expression that lives on YouTube,
[909.62 → 916.36] and that's very true, and the content that brands have told us they want to advertise against.
[916.46 → 917.52] So, yeah, I get that.
[917.52 → 922.90] If you're seeing fluctuations in your ad revenue that's for us over the next few weeks,
[923.08 → 926.28] it may be because we're fine-tuning our ad systems.
[926.78 → 928.54] So, yeah.
[928.70 → 929.56] I don't know.
[930.28 → 938.92] I'd be interested if you could see, like, both paths of the future to see which one actually results in less ad revenue on YouTube.
[939.92 → 940.42] You know what I mean?
[940.42 → 944.24] Because some channels might get completely axed in terms of ad revenue.
[944.64 → 948.50] Some channels might only get certain types of ads because they're creating filters, right?
[948.54 → 950.96] So some companies could be like, we don't care.
[951.08 → 951.88] Throw it on everything, right?
[951.88 → 957.56] Maybe some market research will happen at one point, or at some point, sorry, and we'll get to find out.
[957.56 → 963.16] Yeah, but, like, the total amount of money being invested into YouTube ads, will this potentially make it go up?
[963.44 → 966.06] Because people are like, oh, okay, we can filter more aggressively.
[966.48 → 968.60] That sounds like a better advertising revenue for us.
[968.90 → 972.46] Or will it go down because they're axing too many things?
[972.48 → 974.84] I guess it depends on, like, who the consumer base is for that company.
[975.00 → 978.94] You know, obviously you have a company like Walmart and a company like Razor.
[979.04 → 980.34] Their consumer bases are completely different.
[980.34 → 981.22] Yeah, yeah.
[982.46 → 988.28] Anyway, moving on to more tech-related subjects because there's probably Twitch chat screams about that currently.
[988.56 → 990.58] Ashes of the Singularity receives...
[990.58 → 991.12] Receives.
[991.56 → 992.52] Wow, I can't talk today.
[992.62 → 994.44] Happy I did those Tech Week episodes earlier.
[994.62 → 995.78] Yeah, receives with a Z.
[996.04 → 997.88] Oh, yeah, that sort of worked out.
[997.90 → 998.34] Like Razor.
[998.52 → 1000.68] Receives Ry zen performance update.
[1000.78 → 1004.24] Up to 31% improvement.
[1004.86 → 1006.48] Actually freaking epic.
[1006.64 → 1008.50] We're going to jump to the Extreme Tech article.
[1008.50 → 1011.56] This was posted on the forum by HK05.
[1011.98 → 1013.66] I'm also going to post this in the Twitch chat.
[1013.78 → 1019.34] I forgot that I, like, sort of had to do things while I'm on the show that aren't just only talking all the time.
[1020.22 → 1022.46] Ah, giant advertisement in my face.
[1022.52 → 1023.54] Make that go away.
[1023.74 → 1024.54] Jump over to the screen.
[1024.68 → 1025.26] There we go.
[1025.54 → 1026.36] Ashes of Singularity.
[1027.18 → 1027.94] Massive boost.
[1028.44 → 1029.06] It's pretty cool.
[1029.14 → 1031.90] I'm not surprised its Ashes of all things.
[1032.10 → 1033.70] Like, it's barely even a game.
[1033.70 → 1036.76] It's essentially a benchmark with gameplay elements.
[1037.08 → 1038.64] I want to try something out.
[1038.74 → 1040.04] Let's go to Twitch.
[1041.24 → 1042.30] That's our channel.
[1042.62 → 1043.14] .tv.
[1043.44 → 1044.08] Not that.
[1045.02 → 1047.34] I want to search up Ashes on Twitch.
[1047.40 → 1048.20] She's playing it right now.
[1048.22 → 1050.14] See if there's anyone playing it.
[1050.14 → 1059.62] Games, one show.
[1059.94 → 1060.34] Yes.
[1061.90 → 1063.98] No channels currently live.
[1064.52 → 1064.76] Whew.
[1065.76 → 1067.08] I just, yeah.
[1067.90 → 1068.70] I don't know.
[1068.74 → 1069.44] Well, that's uncomfortable.
[1069.98 → 1072.80] It just, it's like, and it's a wonderful benchmark.
[1073.26 → 1074.00] I love it.
[1074.12 → 1075.30] It's a great benchmark.
[1075.30 → 1078.40] I just, I don't, I don't, I don't personally know anyone.
[1078.50 → 1079.18] Let's do a straw poll.
[1079.66 → 1080.74] Let's, let's do a straw poll.
[1080.80 → 1085.78] I want to see if there's anyone who's actually, like, played through, not, not just, like,
[1085.84 → 1086.66] started a game.
[1086.76 → 1089.00] I want, I want someone who's, like, played through the whole thing.
[1089.32 → 1090.38] Let's do a straw poll.
[1092.40 → 1094.00] Have you played through?
[1094.04 → 1096.02] Want to check out more of the notes on Ashes of Singularity?
[1096.26 → 1096.70] Absolutely.
[1097.66 → 1103.80] So, while Luke is working on the straw poll, AMD cited Intel optimization as the biggest
[1103.80 → 1109.38] reason that the Ry zen chips weren't blowing things out of the water on 1080p gaming tasks.
[1110.38 → 1114.74] So, we have a game in Ashes, which is publicly, am I correct?
[1114.90 → 1118.32] It's, they're publicly, they publicly announced it's optimized for AMD.
[1118.48 → 1119.34] It's optimized for Ry zen.
[1119.86 → 1124.36] The performance boosts are, as we said, significant, up to 31% improvement.
[1125.40 → 1131.18] 1.27x performance improvement in GPU focus benchmark and a 12% boost in the CPU focus benchmark.
[1131.38 → 1131.70] Nice.
[1131.98 → 1132.18] Mm-hmm.
[1132.18 → 1135.10] Those are both really significant.
[1135.48 → 1138.16] But that GPU focused one is really intense.
[1138.56 → 1138.78] Yeah.
[1138.98 → 1141.00] That's, that is not a small number.
[1141.20 → 1146.44] And Bethesda has also pledged to work with AMD to improve game performance in future titles.
[1146.60 → 1147.40] That's really exciting.
[1147.54 → 1147.70] Yeah.
[1147.82 → 1152.30] And so, I guess, obviously, that depends on what kind of system you have and what kind
[1152.30 → 1152.90] of games you're into.
[1152.90 → 1158.56] I mean, it would be nice if, oh, the architectures were similar enough to where, you know, you would
[1158.56 → 1160.28] get similar performance across the board.
[1160.28 → 1164.94] But at the same time, you know, we talk about winning competition, and we talk about, okay,
[1164.94 → 1168.42] we want, we want chips to have certain selling points.
[1168.42 → 1173.00] And as long as devs can optimize their games for either AMD or Intel, that's going to be
[1173.00 → 1173.58] a selling point.
[1173.62 → 1175.12] And I see you're very amused by the straw poll.
[1175.36 → 1175.76] No!
[1175.76 → 1176.56] 94%.
[1176.56 → 1178.40] A crushing victory for the no.
[1178.42 → 1181.80] And there's probably a little bit of trolling going on with the yeses, too.
[1181.86 → 1182.16] Yeah.
[1182.42 → 1183.80] Like, I'm assuming.
[1183.96 → 1187.20] I'm sure there are some that actually, actually did it.
[1187.28 → 1189.84] But, like, I've never even clicked on the play button.
[1189.96 → 1191.66] I've done a lot of benchmarking in Ashes.
[1192.04 → 1193.12] It's a wonderful benchmark.
[1193.54 → 1194.96] Scales really well with different things.
[1195.04 → 1197.08] Not surprised they got this update really quick.
[1197.22 → 1199.76] Love to see them continuing on with different things.
[1199.84 → 1202.00] Their DirectX 12 stuff was really cool to play with.
[1202.06 → 1203.76] I like that they have GPU and CPU focused.
[1203.76 → 1207.80] I like that they have the performance numbers for both, so you can see what's throttling
[1207.80 → 1208.40] you and stuff.
[1209.04 → 1209.86] Wonderful benchmark.
[1210.20 → 1210.86] Perfect.
[1211.52 → 1212.34] Really, really like it.
[1213.44 → 1216.92] What's really exciting about what you were just talking about while I was messing around
[1216.92 → 1221.14] doing stupid things is that that's going to be fun for us, and that's going to be fun
[1221.14 → 1222.66] for everyone that owns a Ry zen chip.
[1222.86 → 1223.00] Yes.
[1223.00 → 1229.22] Because as these things go on, as a new game that comes out from Bethesda, I guess, that's
[1229.22 → 1233.54] optimized for Ry zen, we'll be able to see more advancements in the benchmarking
[1233.54 → 1233.94] comparison.
[1234.14 → 1238.52] Because now, individual game benchmarks that I used to do back in the day will actually
[1238.52 → 1239.46] matter a lot more.
[1239.70 → 1245.46] Because instead of like, oh, the versus between these systems, well, this one's 10% faster.
[1245.58 → 1250.04] So every single game is 10% faster on that systems, give or take a little bit.
[1250.58 → 1255.46] Games specifically tuned with Ry zen in mind will do a lot better than just a backlog that
[1255.46 → 1259.12] all us reviewers already had of games that didn't really have it in mind at all and were
[1259.12 → 1260.22] made for the Intel platform.
[1260.22 → 1266.52] Yeah, and if Ry zen undercuts Intel as much as some folks are predicting, then it's going
[1266.52 → 1269.36] to continue to become a more attractive platform for devs.
[1269.38 → 1272.50] So hopefully we'll see some more of this stuff and things will get more interesting.
[1272.74 → 1273.20] Yeah, absolutely.
[1273.44 → 1274.80] I'm super stoked for that.
[1274.86 → 1275.68] That's very cool.
[1276.14 → 1281.92] That's, in my opinion, cooler than the performance that came on launch, which was already like
[1281.92 → 1283.60] a fascinating story.
[1283.60 → 1290.92] Moving on, the Oculus co-founder Palmer Luckey leaves Facebook.
[1291.14 → 1295.98] When asked if Lucky's departure was voluntary, Facebook representatives declined to comment,
[1296.18 → 1301.64] but they cited a policy of not discussing internal personal matters, or personnel matters, sorry.
[1301.90 → 1303.86] And I actually totally believe that.
[1304.02 → 1307.64] It doesn't seem like something they would necessarily hide.
[1307.78 → 1310.04] They've been fairly transparent about what's been going on there.
[1310.04 → 1316.68] Lucky wilfully skipped the last Oculus conference after being a major personality at OC1 and OC2.
[1318.44 → 1325.26] Yeah, it's been a controversial thing for a while because of his involvement with Nimble America.
[1326.30 → 1329.66] To be fair, like, Oculus was sold for $2 billion.
[1330.24 → 1331.62] He's a very wealthy dude.
[1331.62 → 1331.66] He's a very wealthy dude.
[1332.18 → 1338.78] The $10,000 investment is, I believe, what it was into Nimble America to, like, make memes about Trump.
[1339.62 → 1342.10] I don't think that was a lot of money for him.
[1342.68 → 1349.46] Well, as I said a few minutes ago, those of you who follow me on Twitter, you might know I do not discuss my personal political opinions,
[1349.58 → 1350.64] and this kind of thing is why.
[1350.84 → 1355.24] I don't have millions of dollars to just give to causes, but all the same, I don't do it.
[1355.24 → 1358.06] Yeah, I, like, I don't know.
[1360.42 → 1364.12] The complete, like, all political things aside, I kind of feel bad for the dude.
[1364.58 → 1365.94] Because, like, I'm really into VR.
[1366.06 → 1367.76] He did a lot of really amazing things for VR.
[1368.06 → 1377.54] And now, whether they are commenting or not, whether they made him leave or not, I feel like he was kind of squished out of that space.
[1377.68 → 1377.98] Yeah.
[1377.98 → 1384.80] Whether through indirect pressure, whether through direct pressure, however it happened.
[1385.00 → 1388.12] We're probably not going to know either ever or not for a long time.
[1388.20 → 1391.36] Even just because it was too public of a position.
[1391.80 → 1392.04] Yeah.
[1392.36 → 1398.00] And I think he just wanted to work on things, and he was put in a super public position.
[1398.32 → 1405.48] And I don't feel like that was, I do not personally feel like that was the position that he personally wanted to be in.
[1405.48 → 1407.26] I have no idea because I'm not him.
[1408.00 → 1413.54] And there's a lot of people who, you know, just aren't necessarily suited to wear both of those hats, you know?
[1413.68 → 1413.88] Yeah.
[1413.92 → 1417.74] You could be awesome at one thing, but, yeah, that happens sometimes.
[1417.86 → 1418.98] It's unfortunate, you know?
[1418.98 → 1432.74] And, like, from talking to him in person, from reading some of his interviews, from watching some of his interviews, from reading his own personal Reddit comments, he didn't really like filtering, like, his personal opinions and feelings and whatnot.
[1433.10 → 1433.28] Yeah.
[1433.28 → 1437.26] As, like, as most super public, like, CEO kind of figures do.
[1438.22 → 1439.50] So, I don't know.
[1439.62 → 1443.14] Maybe he will enjoy his life more now.
[1443.28 → 1444.44] Maybe this is a good thing for him.
[1444.44 → 1449.58] And I'm sorry to see that he got squished out of his space, but if this was his move, it might have been the right one.
[1449.76 → 1449.98] Yeah.
[1450.04 → 1450.42] I don't know.
[1450.64 → 1450.84] Yeah.
[1451.00 → 1452.68] He could go off and enjoy his billions.
[1452.86 → 1454.52] Not a bad position to be in.
[1454.76 → 1457.92] I don't think he got all of that, but, like, I'm sure he's super wealthy.
[1458.16 → 1458.88] His multiple millions.
[1458.92 → 1459.28] Yes.
[1459.40 → 1459.60] Yeah.
[1459.72 → 1461.26] I'm sure he's very, very wealthy.
[1461.26 → 1472.66] In other more funny news, a Samsung store caught fire the day before the Galaxy S8 announcement, which is just sort of hilarious.
[1472.98 → 1474.34] Truth is stranger to the fiction, isn't it?
[1474.44 → 1474.66] Yeah.
[1474.78 → 1478.76] I don't even have anything, like, specific to even say about this, but.
[1478.84 → 1479.76] Just, LOL.
[1479.96 → 1480.20] Just.
[1480.28 → 1481.40] How does that happen?
[1481.66 → 1481.94] Like.
[1483.52 → 1485.52] Oh, of course, there are different things.
[1485.64 → 1486.78] This is a CNET video.
[1486.96 → 1489.54] It doesn't show the store after the fire, does it?
[1489.58 → 1495.18] I will say they don't know what the cause of the fire is, whether it was exploding electronics or something else, but.
[1495.32 → 1496.52] That would have been hilarious.
[1496.54 → 1499.44] It would have been, but as of right now, the official word is we don't know.
[1499.70 → 1499.76] So.
[1499.94 → 1500.02] Yeah.
[1500.16 → 1500.84] But it did happen.
[1501.26 → 1501.40] Yeah.
[1501.40 → 1503.82] And this was pasted by Hey Yo on the forum.
[1504.32 → 1504.80] Hey Yo.
[1504.84 → 1505.26] Hey Yo.
[1505.52 → 1508.48] Maybe a Scott Hall fan for all those who remember him from the wrestling circuit.
[1508.66 → 1508.80] Anyway.
[1508.94 → 1509.06] Oh, damn.
[1509.40 → 1510.62] I have no idea.
[1510.74 → 1512.44] I am super dating myself with that reference.
[1512.50 → 1514.54] I don't have a clue what you're talking about.
[1514.54 → 1517.24] Samsung has unveiled the Galaxy.
[1517.38 → 1518.18] I actually don't.
[1518.46 → 1520.92] The Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus.
[1522.08 → 1528.12] They have 3000 William hour or 3500 William hour batteries, as you'd probably expect.
[1528.64 → 1531.90] They have a rear mounted fingerprint sensor, as you'd probably expect.
[1532.14 → 1538.50] They have the Bigsby AI assistant with a dedicated button, just in case you didn't have enough AI assistants yet.
[1538.72 → 1543.62] Maybe you can queue them all up at the same time and tell them all to do the same thing, and maybe one of them will do it correctly.
[1543.62 → 1545.74] That would be a pretty interesting thing to do.
[1545.84 → 1548.30] Oh, and the feature that they are highlighting.
[1548.44 → 1548.46] Yes.
[1548.56 → 1548.96] Okay.
[1549.38 → 1549.90] Yeah.
[1550.00 → 1552.58] Let's see if I can actually find that on the site.
[1553.32 → 1561.64] Essentially, they are touting the extensive safety testing their new phones are going through as a feature.
[1561.64 → 1568.34] So, I was saying earlier, what a brave new world we're living in, where, hey, this phone won't explode.
[1568.60 → 1570.38] Or has a lower likeliness, too.
[1570.54 → 1574.60] Has a low likelihood of explosion as a feature.
[1574.96 → 1576.50] Just let that sink in for a second.
[1576.90 → 1579.20] Hey, your pants are less likely to light on fire.
[1579.44 → 1580.82] So, hopefully that's good.
[1580.90 → 1581.92] And your car and your house.
[1582.02 → 1582.84] You know, no big deal.
[1582.84 → 1590.04] Also, it has an 18.5 by 9 display, which just straight up pisses me off.
[1590.76 → 1592.56] I don't even have a ton else to say outside of that.
[1592.56 → 1600.42] No, and I was, at first glance I saw that, and I was thinking, oh, maybe it's because they're measuring how, you know, it's got the curve screen at the edge.
[1600.48 → 1602.04] But that will make it bigger the other way.
[1602.04 → 1604.32] So, I have no idea why.
[1604.58 → 1609.72] Hey, let's add another 2.5 to the ratio.
[1609.82 → 1610.26] Just because.
[1610.36 → 1610.66] Why not?
[1610.88 → 1611.10] Yeah.
[1611.54 → 1613.28] Like, it's so weird.
[1613.62 → 1618.52] The LG G6 had an 18.9 aspect ratio, which is a little wonky.
[1618.60 → 1623.14] But at least you've got that like 2 to 1 sort of deal going on, which is kind of cool.
[1623.76 → 1626.08] They just had to add that .5.
[1626.08 → 1635.44] I feel like internally, just because it makes me dislike it so much, I feel like they're just trying to be like, oh, artist has slightly more numbers.
[1636.02 → 1638.68] Yeah, and I'm thinking, oh, they could do that.
[1638.98 → 1644.94] And also, you're thinking maybe that reduces down to a more common display ratio, but I don't believe it does.
[1645.00 → 1648.22] It's not like the 2.35 to 1 that they use for movies and stuff.
[1648.28 → 1648.90] It's not even that.
[1649.02 → 1651.64] So, it's just strange.
[1651.64 → 1658.54] The Galaxy S8 has a 5.8 inch display and the S8 Plus has a 6.2 inch display.
[1658.68 → 1663.30] Each has a 2960 by 1440p pixel resolution.
[1665.40 → 1665.96] Okay.
[1666.32 → 1669.30] The S8 works out to 570 pixels per inch.
[1669.68 → 1675.64] The S8 Plus is 529, hence the bigger screen, same resolution, lower PPI.
[1675.64 → 1677.06] That's a lot of pixels per inch, Luke.
[1677.58 → 1678.12] It is.
[1679.08 → 1679.96] That PP.
[1680.50 → 1681.02] I.
[1681.64 → 1682.72] Let's see here.
[1683.40 → 1683.98] I don't know.
[1684.18 → 1690.08] The phones right now, like, I'm excited about the Pixel 2.
[1691.18 → 1691.70] I don't.
[1691.86 → 1692.38] Okay.
[1692.48 → 1693.36] So, there's another thing.
[1693.46 → 1693.98] Let's see if it's.
[1694.04 → 1694.80] Yeah, it's right here.
[1695.12 → 1698.94] Special Galaxy S8 Microsoft Edition to be sold in Microsoft stores.
[1699.18 → 1701.84] And this is just so ridiculous.
[1702.04 → 1702.96] This is pretty bad.
[1702.96 → 1704.30] I don't even know what to say.
[1704.38 → 1707.44] This was posted by Daring on the forum, who's a float plane pilot.
[1707.58 → 1708.08] Thanks, dude.
[1708.08 → 1712.32] We're working on some really cool stuff that hopefully you will enjoy.
[1714.24 → 1718.56] So, Microsoft is unable to sell, really, their own mobile OS.
[1718.56 → 1719.94] Or that's what's stated in here.
[1720.36 → 1721.82] They really don't sell very many of them.
[1722.48 → 1725.70] So, they're trying to sell a customized version of the S8.
[1728.00 → 1728.68] Listen to this.
[1728.72 → 1731.28] The phones are still running Android, but with a number of differences.
[1731.70 → 1733.26] Cortana instead of Google Assistant.
[1733.72 → 1734.96] Office is pre-installed.
[1734.96 → 1736.46] Outlook instead of Gmail.
[1736.88 → 1739.14] OneDrive instead of Google Drive.
[1740.24 → 1740.54] Okay.
[1742.62 → 1744.98] But did you tell them?
[1745.08 → 1746.04] Did you mention the triple?
[1746.22 → 1748.46] Yeah, it doesn't say it in here.
[1748.54 → 1751.44] But I'm going to jump back to the notes of this part, which is even better.
[1751.98 → 1753.16] The update will.
[1754.56 → 1755.46] Where did that go?
[1755.80 → 1756.52] Where did it go?
[1756.80 → 1757.86] The update will finally go.
[1759.64 → 1761.00] Someone screwed up the dock.
[1761.10 → 1761.78] Someone did.
[1762.16 → 1762.44] I noticed this.
[1762.44 → 1764.36] Because these are notes from something else.
[1765.14 → 1766.26] Is it further down, maybe?
[1766.36 → 1766.98] Or is it just?
[1767.26 → 1768.66] No, it's not.
[1769.06 → 1769.32] Oh.
[1769.40 → 1770.26] They killed the link.
[1771.36 → 1772.46] Maybe that was on purpose.
[1772.60 → 1772.94] I don't know.
[1772.96 → 1773.82] Who boobed up the dock?
[1773.84 → 1774.56] Well, this is awkward.
[1775.04 → 1775.70] This is awkward.
[1775.84 → 1777.56] Anyway, what it said before.
[1777.94 → 1779.80] I can't find it in the dock now.
[1779.80 → 1785.58] But what it said before was that it would happen on the first time you updated the device.
[1785.74 → 1787.48] It would download OneDrive.
[1787.72 → 1789.08] It would download Outlook.
[1789.16 → 1790.50] It would download Cortana.
[1790.60 → 1791.44] All that kind of stuff.
[1791.44 → 1799.98] And because of Bigsby being on the phone and Google Assistant being in Android, you would have three AI assistant services on your phone all at the same time.
[1800.32 → 1802.96] So if you get lonely, you don't even need to go out and make friends anymore.
[1803.14 → 1805.14] Just talk to all three of your phone assistants.
[1805.28 → 1806.92] Just cue them all up at the same time.
[1806.96 → 1807.56] How are you doing?
[1807.98 → 1809.18] What are you up to today?
[1810.46 → 1810.94] I don't know.
[1811.04 → 1814.22] I wish you could get them to disagree with each other, and you could have a debate.
[1816.14 → 1816.74] You know?
[1817.16 → 1818.08] That would be pretty good.
[1818.14 → 1819.98] Some people just don't like leaving home.
[1819.98 → 1825.88] What drives me insane about this is I'm pretty sure you could just extremely easily do this on your own.
[1827.02 → 1828.08] Because you're just downloading.
[1828.32 → 1829.32] Like there's an Outlook app.
[1829.60 → 1830.60] And there's a OneDrive app.
[1831.00 → 1832.60] And I believe there's the Cortana app.
[1833.08 → 1835.44] Yes, but it's Samsung.
[1835.72 → 1838.14] And they kind of have a history of these shenanigans.
[1838.26 → 1840.64] Just blow tons of stuff onto the phone.
[1840.78 → 1841.82] Even more bloatware.
[1842.00 → 1842.20] Yeah.
[1842.20 → 1843.20] Gross.
[1844.24 → 1845.08] I don't like it at all.
[1845.44 → 1847.32] Makes me unhappy very particularly.
[1847.86 → 1852.26] Anyway, Samsung to sell refurbished Note 7 phones.
[1852.90 → 1853.36] Oh boy.
[1853.90 → 1856.84] This was posted by SC Gazelle on the forum.
[1857.52 → 1861.18] We're going to check out the Wired article that was linked.
[1861.44 → 1863.34] I'm going to drop this in the chat real quick.
[1863.34 → 1871.50] The phones will be refurbished, broken down for parts, or recycled.
[1871.68 → 1872.70] One of the three.
[1873.30 → 1876.58] So it's going to be interesting to see.
[1876.84 → 1880.88] Like I'm really excited whether from user error or not.
[1880.98 → 1882.44] Because it can happen from user error.
[1882.58 → 1882.76] Yeah.
[1882.88 → 1887.02] But the first one of these to explode or light on fire is going to be very fun.
[1887.92 → 1890.14] Just how news outlets take it.
[1890.42 → 1891.96] Just how people freak out.
[1892.04 → 1892.74] I'm really excited.
[1893.04 → 1895.88] Even if someone just straight up stabs it with a knife.
[1896.04 → 1896.34] Yeah.
[1896.64 → 1897.74] Don't think it's going to matter.
[1898.04 → 1898.56] Oh, yeah.
[1898.74 → 1901.06] Like if it lights on fire, if it blows up.
[1901.06 → 1903.06] I could see someone doing that just for attention.
[1903.22 → 1904.88] Like let me douse this thing with gasoline.
[1905.04 → 1905.98] Take a match to it.
[1906.28 → 1907.36] And don't do this.
[1907.48 → 1907.94] Don't do this.
[1907.94 → 1908.30] Yeah.
[1909.20 → 1912.86] And say, oh, look what happened to my refurbished Samsung Note 7.
[1913.04 → 1913.34] Yeah.
[1913.86 → 1914.06] So.
[1914.36 → 1915.80] Like who's that dude on YouTube?
[1915.92 → 1916.44] Tech Racks?
[1917.02 → 1918.74] Oh, the tech construction.
[1918.74 → 1919.94] Like he's going to make one.
[1920.04 → 1920.76] Oh, yeah.
[1920.76 → 1921.86] I could see that.
[1921.96 → 1922.26] Yeah.
[1922.54 → 1922.80] Okay.
[1924.04 → 1928.66] Anyway, they say the Note 7 is recycled and processed in an environmentally friendly manner.
[1928.92 → 1930.40] Which like that's cool.
[1930.58 → 1931.00] Thank you.
[1931.12 → 1931.96] That's good, I guess.
[1932.92 → 1938.22] They're going to remove semiconductors and camera modules for test sample production purposes.
[1939.26 → 1942.82] Basically, they're going to try to use them in many ways and refurbish and sell them as well.
[1943.26 → 1944.44] Which like, I don't know.
[1944.44 → 1947.52] I know a lot of people that really like Note 7s.
[1947.92 → 1951.60] Apparently, they've had a 97% return rate.
[1951.66 → 1952.62] This isn't in there either.
[1952.72 → 1954.00] What the heck happened to the dock?
[1954.16 → 1961.42] They had a 97% return rate of Note 7s in South Korea, but significantly lower percentages of returns elsewhere.
[1961.42 → 1964.46] And they're also planning on absolutely killing.
[1964.46 → 1967.74] I also don't see this in the dock, but it was earlier.
[1967.86 → 1968.68] I don't know what happened.
[1969.14 → 1975.44] On absolutely killing any potential for the phone to charge at all through a software update.
[1975.58 → 1979.88] They have reduced the total possible charge of the phone, and now they're just going to make it so you can't charge it.
[1979.88 → 1989.46] But also noted is that they expect clever users to just not update so that they won't have that issue.
[1989.98 → 1994.00] At this point, I just wonder why you would bother maybe just to be a contrarian.
[1994.70 → 1995.26] Maybe.
[1995.44 → 1996.16] Fight the power, man.
[1996.34 → 1996.54] Yeah.
[1996.88 → 1997.02] Yeah.
[1997.02 → 2005.72] With that, speaking of fight the power, let's scroll very far down to our sponsor spots.
[2005.90 → 2006.42] Oh, good lord.
[2007.66 → 2010.02] Thank you, Moss, for sponsoring the WAN show.
[2010.40 → 2015.00] And you can fight with power using Moss spring cables.
[2015.10 → 2018.24] That might be the worst add tie-in spot I've ever done.
[2018.58 → 2021.58] So these guys are various types of USB cables.
[2021.66 → 2022.22] What do you have over there?
[2022.34 → 2022.78] C to C.
[2023.04 → 2023.74] C to C.
[2023.74 → 2024.74] So that's cool.
[2024.74 → 2032.74] If you have a Nexus 6P, like I do, which I just bought yesterday, then you can use one of these because that's a USB-C port.
[2033.26 → 2033.44] Yeah.
[2033.86 → 2034.30] You know what?
[2034.38 → 2034.58] Okay.
[2034.70 → 2036.70] I'm going to take a quick aside during this add spot.
[2037.14 → 2040.04] But I went to my parents, and my phone was dying.
[2040.16 → 2043.72] And I was like, crap, I guess I'm not going to be able to charge my phone because I have a USB Type-C phone.
[2044.02 → 2046.70] And I was like, there's no way they'll have USB Type-C cables.
[2046.98 → 2051.86] My mom has a 6P and thus has a bunch of USB Type-C cables.
[2051.86 → 2052.72] She has more than me.
[2053.04 → 2053.32] How about that?
[2053.32 → 2054.32] And she was ready to go.
[2054.32 → 2054.64] Yeah.
[2055.06 → 2056.20] Maybe with MOS cables.
[2056.32 → 2056.74] I'm not sure.
[2056.84 → 2059.50] Well, there is a person that has more USB Type-C cables than you.
[2059.56 → 2059.92] That's amazing.
[2060.10 → 2060.24] Yes.
[2060.32 → 2062.00] It was surprising and odd.
[2062.10 → 2062.58] How about that?
[2062.78 → 2063.48] Slightly uncomfortable.
[2063.88 → 2065.06] I finally got this box open.
[2065.16 → 2066.52] That wasn't MOS cables' fault.
[2066.60 → 2067.36] That was me being silly.
[2067.82 → 2069.98] But one of the other cool things about these, they're braided.
[2070.12 → 2070.48] They're nice.
[2070.56 → 2071.78] They have a little spring thing on the end.
[2071.84 → 2073.04] This is why they're called spring cables.
[2073.38 → 2077.08] So you can bend them over, and they'll snap back in place, which is actually pretty sweet.
[2077.08 → 2081.00] And that's to help them not get screwed up right at the joint and stuff, which is cool.
[2081.40 → 2086.56] And if you use their organizer things, this one is the six-pack.
[2086.88 → 2087.46] What's that called?
[2087.64 → 2088.40] The Minos?
[2088.54 → 2088.84] Minos?
[2088.90 → 2089.22] Minos.
[2089.22 → 2089.32] Minos.
[2089.32 → 2089.44] Minos.
[2089.44 → 2092.52] But there's a bigger one just called the Moss Organizer.
[2093.10 → 2095.84] If I pull this out, there we go.
[2095.98 → 2097.04] They're magnetic and stuff.
[2097.34 → 2100.66] And these being metal on the ends, can snap to them.
[2101.60 → 2107.72] So you can put the organizer on something, like your desk, and then use this to snap the cable down.
[2107.88 → 2110.00] Well, this end would probably be plugged into something else.
[2110.06 → 2111.66] So this end can snap there.
[2111.92 → 2113.72] And when you're not using it, it can just sit on here.
[2113.72 → 2121.02] So instead of having weird, not very good-looking cable-manage-y thingies like these,
[2121.34 → 2124.72] where they're just weird white things, and you just shove your cable in there.
[2124.72 → 2125.64] They kind of look like butt cheeks.
[2125.84 → 2126.82] And it's not great.
[2127.12 → 2127.32] Yeah.
[2127.82 → 2130.30] And you have to shove it back in and take it back out and stuff.
[2130.60 → 2130.82] There.
[2131.28 → 2131.68] Magnets.
[2132.00 → 2132.18] Cool.
[2132.44 → 2138.84] And last but not least, there's the Moss Backpack, which has a giant power cable coming out of the end,
[2139.62 → 2140.84] which might be a little bit confusing.
[2140.94 → 2141.82] Oh, I didn't even notice that.
[2141.82 → 2144.36] There's little spots for your fingers, so you can unplug it from the wall more easily.
[2146.10 → 2148.10] I don't think I've ever seen that on a power cable before.
[2148.82 → 2150.32] That goes into the bag.
[2150.54 → 2150.90] That's awesome.
[2150.90 → 2156.66] Where you can find one power plug for, like, your laptop or whatever, and two USB power plugs,
[2156.84 → 2163.10] which could be pretty nifty, because if you have two USB banks that you have often plugged into your bag, I guess,
[2163.22 → 2165.38] and, like, your laptop, you could have all those plugged in.
[2165.68 → 2169.46] And then just as you're moving around, plug this thing in inside your backpack,
[2169.46 → 2171.96] so you don't have to have your laptop or whatever exposed.
[2172.06 → 2175.82] Hassle-free charging if you're not using your device at a particular time.
[2176.06 → 2176.20] Yeah.
[2176.24 → 2177.62] That magnet looked pretty strong.
[2177.70 → 2180.08] I think even Insane Clown Posse would be proud of that magnet.
[2180.36 → 2181.06] I think it's amazing.
[2181.06 → 2184.40] Moving on, we have Total.
[2184.62 → 2187.48] So Total is talking about their EN10.
[2187.62 → 2194.16] Total's Magnus EN10 series is one of the smallest VR-ready mini gaming PCs available.
[2194.44 → 2195.20] It is pretty wicked.
[2195.28 → 2196.66] I've seen it a few different times.
[2197.02 → 2202.16] And it is available with the GTX 1060 or GTX 1070 configuration,
[2202.16 → 2207.26] and it features Intel Skylike Core i5-6400T, which is pretty wicked.
[2207.36 → 2207.98] Those things are cool.
[2208.30 → 2215.04] And there's the VR Go, which is, in my opinion, probably the best implementation of a VR backpack.
[2215.26 → 2217.28] I'm not just saying that because it's during the sponsor spot.
[2217.54 → 2219.50] I really like that they have hot swappable batteries,
[2219.50 → 2221.54] and I really like the capacity of the batteries,
[2221.90 → 2225.36] because you can actually game for a pretty significant amount of time while swapping those out.
[2225.46 → 2226.42] It's actually pretty cool.
[2226.42 → 2230.76] I just didn't do a dedicated video on it because no one is really all that.
[2230.88 → 2231.62] I can't say no one.
[2231.94 → 2236.42] There is a very noticeably smaller percentage of people that are interested in VR content right now,
[2236.56 → 2238.08] so there you go.
[2238.14 → 2242.06] But it is a very acceptable amount of weight for a backpack.
[2242.30 → 2247.76] It feels like when you play a military-style game, it feels like actually realistic.
[2248.00 → 2248.84] Enhanced realism.
[2248.90 → 2249.78] Yeah, like I don't know.
[2250.18 → 2252.36] It's not heavy enough that it'll actually feel tedious,
[2252.36 → 2256.54] but it is heavy enough that you realize that it's there, which can actually help.
[2256.70 → 2259.78] The hot swappable battery thing is probably the best solution that we're going to have
[2259.78 → 2265.90] until we figure out extremely efficient GPUs or extremely high-capacity batteries.
[2266.22 → 2267.60] And there's a couple that are like that,
[2267.86 → 2270.96] but the VR Go has the best capacity, I do believe.
[2271.08 → 2273.60] Then there's the 1080 Mini, which I have made a video on,
[2273.86 → 2276.30] showing people the different ways that you can use it
[2276.30 → 2279.06] because I didn't think Total actually did a very good job of that.
[2279.18 → 2279.84] Sorry, Total.
[2279.88 → 2280.24] Oh, wow.
[2280.24 → 2282.96] I did it for you anyway, so it's fine.
[2283.34 → 2287.80] It has ice storm cooling, a 90mm fan for increased static pressure,
[2287.92 → 2290.22] and a 100mm fan for maximum airflow.
[2290.36 → 2293.48] There is actually two different fans on the cooler.
[2293.62 → 2295.08] They look relatively similar at first,
[2295.16 → 2297.32] but you can tell that one of them is slightly larger than the other.
[2298.12 → 2300.84] Anyway, that's it for the sponsor spots.
[2301.80 → 2304.92] Moving up, we have a few extra things in here that is interesting.
[2305.08 → 2306.66] This was just sort of sad.
[2307.18 → 2308.82] I don't really know how else to even say it.
[2308.82 → 2310.86] It was posted by NumLock21 on the forum.
[2311.70 → 2313.34] Razor servers went down,
[2313.70 → 2317.62] resetting all device settings for keyboards and mice
[2317.62 → 2320.16] that didn't have their settings saved in the cloud.
[2320.74 → 2323.86] And that's actually still a scary thing
[2323.86 → 2324.88] because you'd think at first like,
[2325.00 → 2327.16] oh, yeah, but the devices have local storage.
[2327.38 → 2329.20] That is not a default setting.
[2329.20 → 2334.36] It is not a default setting for your device to store your settings locally.
[2335.12 → 2336.74] They are normally stored in the cloud.
[2337.26 → 2340.26] So a huge number of people's devices were set to default,
[2340.80 → 2344.00] and that is just sort of disappointing
[2344.00 → 2345.46] because a lot of people have it really dialled in
[2345.46 → 2347.22] and don't necessarily memorize all their settings.
[2347.58 → 2349.38] Catastrophe of global proportions.
[2349.84 → 2351.48] Skynet screwing up our RGB.
[2351.68 → 2352.20] Pretty much.
[2352.58 → 2353.58] RGB is important.
[2353.58 → 2354.58] Yeah.
[2355.34 → 2356.88] I guess it was RGB profiles too.
[2358.82 → 2359.26] No.
[2359.74 → 2360.10] Yes.
[2360.10 → 2361.74] I hope my laptop is still the same
[2361.74 → 2364.24] because I actually like spent a while fine-tuning it.
[2364.30 → 2365.04] I'm not even kidding
[2365.04 → 2367.72] because I call it Haunter, and it's black and purple themed.
[2367.92 → 2371.18] So I took like the fire preset but made it purple fire.
[2371.18 → 2375.30] And I have like two different tones of purple for the fire.
[2375.84 → 2376.54] Oh, yeah.
[2376.86 → 2378.88] So you see, I'm also using fire.
[2378.98 → 2380.18] Mine is like, it's blue and white.
[2380.36 → 2380.60] But yeah.
[2380.72 → 2381.42] Okay, there you go.
[2381.52 → 2382.32] The fire effect is awesome.
[2382.42 → 2383.32] It's super cool.
[2383.32 → 2383.48] I'm a huge fan of it.
[2383.52 → 2383.68] Yeah.
[2383.82 → 2384.98] I guess you did that for Duke.
[2385.14 → 2385.40] Yeah.
[2385.56 → 2385.72] Yeah.
[2385.90 → 2387.38] Brandon has it as the default,
[2387.54 → 2390.02] which actually looks kind of like a fireplace at first glance.
[2390.52 → 2392.94] And the thing is, I think, with PC customization,
[2393.22 → 2394.72] the amount of effort you put into it.
[2394.72 → 2394.92] Yeah.
[2395.06 → 2396.38] Like, it's not like a liquid.
[2396.60 → 2398.22] It's more like a gas.
[2398.22 → 2403.62] It's going to expand to fill what options are available on your setup.
[2403.86 → 2405.38] So if you have this Racer Chrome thing,
[2405.42 → 2407.94] it's like, oh, yeah, you get like a billion customization options.
[2408.00 → 2408.40] Make it yours.
[2408.46 → 2409.54] I mean, you're going to want to do that.
[2409.64 → 2410.84] So there you go.
[2411.08 → 2413.38] So actually kind of catastrophe for some folks.
[2413.56 → 2416.08] Speaking of it, I'm going to hijack this super hard.
[2417.56 → 2420.36] But if anyone can help me find,
[2421.98 → 2427.68] I want stickers that I can put on my laptop.
[2428.22 → 2429.74] That can make the face.
[2430.86 → 2432.62] But I couldn't figure out how to do that.
[2432.86 → 2436.26] So basically, the back of my laptop right now is flat purple.
[2436.50 → 2436.78] Okay.
[2437.00 → 2440.70] It is one type of purple that looks pretty similar to Haunter's type of purple.
[2441.00 → 2442.52] Oh, and you just make the face.
[2442.88 → 2443.80] But I want to have three different stickers.
[2444.04 → 2446.54] One for each eye and one for the mouth.
[2448.58 → 2449.56] But I haven't,
[2449.56 → 2454.12] I don't know anyone that sells like individual stickers for those things.
[2454.46 → 2456.70] And I don't know how I would go about making that.
[2456.70 → 2457.70] Yeah.
[2458.02 → 2461.42] So if people want to like tweet me with like telling me how the heck I could do that,
[2461.50 → 2462.48] that would be amazing.
[2462.72 → 2463.84] And I would love that.
[2464.26 → 2470.92] Because like I want to use wallpaper engine to somehow get like an animated wallpaper of like Haunter floating there.
[2470.92 → 2473.36] And then I want to have Haunter stickers on the back.
[2473.56 → 2475.48] And then purpled brand everywhere.
[2475.58 → 2476.48] I'm sure that would be done.
[2476.64 → 2478.24] And then the purple fire.
[2478.42 → 2479.18] Like for the stickers,
[2479.28 → 2484.28] you could just find like a vector image or just a really high-res image of Haunter.
[2484.64 → 2487.10] And then like isolate the stuff like in Photoshop.
[2487.44 → 2489.10] Is there like websites that you can buy?
[2489.14 → 2490.74] Like I don't know anything about how I do this.
[2490.82 → 2493.48] Is there like websites you can upload images and print stickers from?
[2493.96 → 2494.28] Yeah.
[2494.28 → 2495.88] Or you could just get like a printer to do it.
[2496.08 → 2496.22] Yeah.
[2496.30 → 2497.96] Like I don't see why you wouldn't be able to do that.
[2499.80 → 2500.70] And then you'd cut it out,
[2500.72 → 2501.04] I guess.
[2501.78 → 2503.76] I got my wife's wedding ring on Etsy.
[2503.82 → 2504.78] I feel like you could do this.
[2505.14 → 2505.52] You know?
[2506.08 → 2506.40] Yeah.
[2506.60 → 2506.80] Yeah.
[2506.80 → 2507.72] And she loves it,
[2507.78 → 2508.14] by the way.
[2508.36 → 2508.96] The internet is wonderful.
[2509.02 → 2510.14] I wasn't laughing at it because of that.
[2510.20 → 2511.08] I was just laughing at it because like,
[2511.18 → 2511.64] holy crap,
[2511.74 → 2512.22] modern times.
[2512.28 → 2512.46] No,
[2512.52 → 2514.88] I was just waiting for people in the chat to say things.
[2515.04 → 2515.46] Oh yeah.
[2515.56 → 2515.68] No,
[2515.74 → 2516.86] I'm sure she loves it.
[2517.34 → 2517.88] But yeah,
[2518.00 → 2518.40] I like,
[2518.40 → 2518.84] I just,
[2518.96 → 2520.60] I would love to be able to do that properly.
[2520.70 → 2521.42] That would be super cool.
[2522.10 → 2525.42] Domino's is beginning to deliver pizzas in Europe with robots.
[2525.52 → 2526.80] They've already done this in New Zealand.
[2526.92 → 2528.12] I don't know if they've done this elsewhere,
[2528.12 → 2531.32] but the first place in Europe to get it will be Hamburg,
[2531.56 → 2531.92] Germany.
[2532.10 → 2534.98] This was posted by co gunnel on the forum.
[2535.14 → 2536.42] Hopefully I said that correctly.
[2541.28 → 2543.42] Dropping in the chat,
[2543.86 → 2545.80] jumping into the article,
[2545.92 → 2546.98] which is still loading.
[2546.98 → 2548.76] I guess we'll just watch it load.
[2548.94 → 2549.26] Why not?
[2549.34 → 2550.08] Although there it is.
[2550.74 → 2552.70] Mail on the daily mile online.
[2553.64 → 2554.94] That's the little robot guy.
[2555.98 → 2557.90] It sends a code to your phone,
[2558.54 → 2561.04] similar to like a two-factor authentication kind of deal.
[2561.28 → 2563.98] And then you have to type the code into the robot in order to get the pizza.
[2564.14 → 2564.78] I think it's amazing.
[2564.88 → 2565.84] I hope it's tamperproof.
[2565.92 → 2568.30] Cause what's to keep someone on that crosswalk from just,
[2568.54 → 2568.84] Oh yeah,
[2568.92 → 2569.16] pizza.
[2569.64 → 2569.86] Well,
[2569.90 → 2570.02] no,
[2570.14 → 2570.60] the code,
[2570.86 → 2572.82] you have to enter the code in order to access the pizza.
[2572.94 → 2573.62] What if they have a hammer?
[2574.14 → 2574.54] Yeah.
[2574.80 → 2575.16] Yeah.
[2575.16 → 2577.70] There's got to be cameras on it or something.
[2577.80 → 2578.82] I would really hope so.
[2578.94 → 2581.42] I also wouldn't be surprised if they only run them.
[2581.94 → 2583.18] Like it doesn't say anything about that in here,
[2583.28 → 2586.12] but I wouldn't be surprised if they only run them at like certain times.
[2586.78 → 2587.08] Piano.
[2588.40 → 2589.98] What a brave new world we're living in.
[2590.22 → 2591.04] There's actual pizza.
[2591.04 → 2599.66] I love how there's like person that got low to the ground with their camera and took it at like this artistic time of day of this like little robot.
[2600.16 → 2601.72] What was that line from,
[2601.92 → 2602.78] what movie was it?
[2602.82 → 2604.86] I think it was Bill Murray and Groundhog Day.
[2605.32 → 2609.14] It reminds me of Rome and how the sun hits the buildings in the afternoon.
[2609.32 → 2610.18] It's like that,
[2610.18 → 2611.12] but with a pizza bot.
[2611.26 → 2611.52] Yes.
[2611.74 → 2612.00] Yeah.
[2612.60 → 2613.22] Let him go.
[2614.32 → 2615.14] That's fantastic.
[2616.44 → 2617.10] He's gone.
[2617.34 → 2617.44] Oh,
[2617.44 → 2617.76] there it goes.
[2617.90 → 2618.38] look at him go.
[2619.06 → 2619.50] That is,
[2619.66 → 2619.80] that,
[2619.90 → 2620.36] that's just wonderful.
[2620.36 → 2622.12] I felt like no one even really reacts.
[2622.58 → 2624.66] I would be so interested if that drove past me.
[2624.90 → 2625.14] Yeah.
[2625.54 → 2625.72] Oh,
[2625.78 → 2625.94] well,
[2626.22 → 2627.00] that's exciting.
[2627.40 → 2628.46] I don't know why it's exciting.
[2628.64 → 2629.20] It just is.
[2629.34 → 2630.32] It's a pizza bot.
[2630.40 → 2631.36] How is it not exciting?
[2631.76 → 2633.40] You shouldn't even have to explain that.
[2633.70 → 2634.36] That's fair.
[2634.54 → 2634.68] Yeah.
[2634.68 → 2635.16] That's fair.
[2635.16 → 2635.56] My,
[2635.62 → 2636.88] my favourite thing.
[2637.78 → 2641.38] If I can find it here that happened as right.
[2641.46 → 2642.12] When I say the
[2642.12 → 2642.80] the name here,
[2642.86 → 2644.00] everyone's going to know what I'm talking about.
[2644.04 → 2647.04] This was posted by SC gazelle on the forum as well.
[2647.04 → 2648.24] Along with the previous post,
[2648.34 → 2650.00] we're going to use the link from the verge.
[2650.30 → 2655.70] Elon Musk launches neural link to make you a cyborg,
[2655.84 → 2658.46] which is so exciting.
[2659.94 → 2661.32] So very cool.
[2661.84 → 2663.28] I'm going to post that in there.
[2663.28 → 2666.72] Elon Musk launches neural link,
[2666.84 → 2669.28] a venture to merge the human brain with AI.
[2669.62 → 2671.74] So this is like a very,
[2671.74 → 2676.36] very early company.
[2676.56 → 2679.38] They're not planning on doing any public things for a while.
[2679.58 → 2683.10] They're setting themselves up as a research company in the medical space in
[2683.10 → 2683.58] California.
[2683.96 → 2686.68] I don't expect anything to come from this for quite some time.
[2686.68 → 2689.90] I personally view Elon Musk's companies in two different categories.
[2690.08 → 2690.76] There's like the
[2691.16 → 2692.86] this is going to make a difference now category.
[2692.86 → 2693.48] Like Tesla,
[2693.88 → 2694.72] like Tesla,
[2695.18 → 2695.90] like SpaceX,
[2696.46 → 2697.62] like solar cities.
[2698.20 → 2700.60] And back in the day before he sold it,
[2700.76 → 2701.32] like PayPal.
[2701.70 → 2703.24] And then I see the other bucket,
[2703.38 → 2704.06] which is the like,
[2704.68 → 2707.84] Elon Musk likes researching this and is interested and wants to drive it
[2707.84 → 2708.16] further.
[2708.24 → 2708.40] Yeah.
[2708.42 → 2710.32] Like this might happen one day.
[2710.32 → 2710.64] Yeah.
[2710.64 → 2715.00] Like his company that researches the potential issues and with AI and how to
[2715.00 → 2715.84] make safe AI.
[2716.24 → 2717.36] And then now this,
[2717.58 → 2717.70] what?
[2717.80 → 2720.94] I like how some of the chat Twitch plays Dion already said Deus Ex.
[2721.10 → 2722.42] So for you Deus Ex fans,
[2722.52 → 2723.84] maybe one day you could,
[2723.94 → 2726.74] you too can unleash your inner Bob page,
[2726.84 → 2728.82] hopefully not for world domination purposes,
[2728.82 → 2730.52] but maybe for cool things.
[2730.56 → 2731.60] I don't know what those would be.
[2731.66 → 2733.08] You might have to ask Elon himself,
[2733.22 → 2734.02] but yeah.
[2734.46 → 2734.94] Yeah.
[2734.94 → 2738.78] So more recently Musk told the crowd in Dubai over time,
[2738.90 → 2743.02] I think we will probably see a closer merger of biological intelligence and
[2743.02 → 2743.82] digital intelligence.
[2744.12 → 2745.58] It's mostly about the bandwidth,
[2745.88 → 2749.04] the speed of the connection between your brain and the digital version of
[2749.04 → 2749.48] yourself,
[2749.82 → 2750.78] particularly output.
[2750.94 → 2752.94] I wonder what the bandwidth of the human brain is.
[2754.06 → 2755.02] Tech would be topic.
[2756.82 → 2757.82] Neural lace.
[2758.76 → 2759.96] Humans could improve themselves.
[2760.08 → 2760.80] So interesting.
[2760.94 → 2761.56] Would you do it?
[2761.56 → 2762.76] If someone was like,
[2762.92 → 2765.60] I can put a chip in your brain, and it will enhance all,
[2765.70 → 2766.24] all,
[2766.34 → 2767.62] all parts of your life.
[2767.72 → 2769.38] You'll be slightly better at everything.
[2770.04 → 2771.20] But what's the risk?
[2771.24 → 2774.14] You're asking me if I would do it because the way you describe it,
[2774.16 → 2775.30] there's no reason to say no,
[2775.40 → 2777.26] but obviously there's probably some sort of downside.
[2777.38 → 2777.96] You're not telling me.
[2778.02 → 2779.20] So no reason to say no.
[2781.44 → 2783.66] How invasive of a surgery are we looking at?
[2783.74 → 2783.90] Well,
[2783.92 → 2784.80] they're putting it in your brain.
[2786.40 → 2786.80] Yeah.
[2786.80 → 2788.72] I guess they'd have to open your skull.
[2789.94 → 2790.92] I'd think about it.
[2791.10 → 2791.30] Yeah.
[2791.30 → 2791.74] Yeah.
[2791.80 → 2793.24] I could be better at most things.
[2793.34 → 2794.48] I could be better at almost everything,
[2794.68 → 2794.96] actually.
[2795.30 → 2797.38] So I would do it.
[2797.76 → 2797.92] Yeah.
[2798.04 → 2799.36] If Elon Musk was like,
[2799.46 → 2799.60] Hey,
[2799.64 → 2799.90] Luke,
[2800.20 → 2803.94] that's all he'd have to say.
[2804.94 → 2805.88] That's your standard.
[2806.44 → 2807.28] That's your standard.
[2807.64 → 2809.08] If Elon Musk comes up and does,
[2810.98 → 2811.36] that's,
[2811.44 → 2811.70] I'm in,
[2811.88 → 2812.34] I'm done.
[2812.56 → 2813.10] No worries.
[2813.18 → 2814.04] I'll sign papers,
[2814.72 → 2815.28] hand them over.
[2815.64 → 2816.26] I'll do it.
[2816.26 → 2816.60] But yeah,
[2816.68 → 2816.84] no,
[2817.12 → 2817.40] if,
[2817.46 → 2817.62] if,
[2817.72 → 2819.94] if I was offered to be in some form of program,
[2819.94 → 2820.66] uh,
[2820.66 → 2821.12] I would,
[2821.18 → 2822.30] I would probably engage.
[2822.30 → 2828.88] Just like all the tweets that I've sent to Elon Musk asking to be the media contact that goes to Mars.
[2829.66 → 2829.90] Like,
[2829.96 → 2830.62] here's my resume.
[2831.20 → 2832.18] I have done the Twitters.
[2832.62 → 2834.06] I have done the videos.
[2834.64 → 2835.32] Send me to Mars.
[2835.68 → 2837.12] I won't be able to do the other stuff.
[2837.24 → 2838.40] I'm too much of a dummy.
[2838.82 → 2840.12] I can't do the science things,
[2840.24 → 2840.68] unfortunately.
[2840.74 → 2841.04] I'm sorry.
[2841.04 → 2841.96] Border rocket.
[2842.14 → 2842.54] But I,
[2842.54 → 2844.10] I will get on that rocket,
[2844.34 → 2847.62] and I will make so many videos about whatever's going on,
[2847.68 → 2849.06] and I will be so interested,
[2849.68 → 2850.86] and I will die on Mars.
[2850.94 → 2851.78] I don't need to come back.
[2851.96 → 2852.14] Yeah.
[2852.44 → 2853.52] You could go up to Mars,
[2853.62 → 2853.96] and like,
[2854.40 → 2855.26] you could estimate,
[2855.44 → 2856.94] because the gravity on Mars is different,
[2857.10 → 2859.62] you could drop a GPU onto the Martian soil,
[2859.86 → 2860.38] and see,
[2860.48 → 2860.84] okay,
[2861.04 → 2861.40] like,
[2861.50 → 2861.70] what's,
[2861.78 → 2862.28] what's,
[2862.36 → 2864.72] what's the likelihood of damage versus Earth?
[2864.72 → 2867.52] I could make holy shit videos about all the tech that we have.
[2868.14 → 2868.50] Uh,
[2868.70 → 2868.96] yeah,
[2869.12 → 2870.02] that would be,
[2870.34 → 2871.54] that's something we could do.
[2871.74 → 2871.96] Hey,
[2872.18 → 2872.40] um,
[2872.56 → 2874.20] portable solar panels,
[2874.44 → 2875.32] even crappier,
[2875.40 → 2876.54] because now we're on Mars,
[2876.60 → 2877.78] and they're further away from the sun.
[2877.90 → 2878.68] Tech Rookie videos?
[2878.70 → 2879.14] There you go.
[2879.44 → 2879.60] Yeah.
[2879.64 → 2879.94] How does,
[2880.02 → 2881.56] how do solar panels function on Mars?
[2882.34 → 2882.62] Just,
[2882.80 → 2882.98] well,
[2883.12 → 2883.60] the same,
[2883.76 → 2884.02] except,
[2884.40 → 2884.86] except,
[2885.14 → 2885.92] not as well.
[2886.20 → 2886.94] Like it if you like it,
[2886.98 → 2887.58] dislike it if you didn't,
[2887.66 → 2887.80] so,
[2887.88 → 2888.02] yeah.
[2888.38 → 2888.58] But,
[2889.02 → 2889.24] well,
[2889.30 → 2891.48] you'd be able to probably float them more easily.
[2892.24 → 2892.78] You would.
[2892.94 → 2893.16] Yeah.
[2893.24 → 2893.64] That's true.
[2893.78 → 2893.92] Yeah,
[2893.92 → 2894.98] there's a little bit more exposure,
[2895.24 → 2897.74] so they'd probably get more energy.
[2898.08 → 2898.76] Define exposure.
[2899.02 → 2899.62] Exposure to what?
[2899.98 → 2901.96] Wouldn't atmosphere reduce how much,
[2902.12 → 2903.50] and like distance to the sun,
[2903.58 → 2906.16] reduce how much energy you can get from solar panels?
[2906.42 → 2907.34] That's what I'm talking about.
[2907.42 → 2907.58] Yeah.
[2907.64 → 2908.28] Because the sun's,
[2908.38 → 2911.34] I imagine the sun is like less bright on Mars.
[2911.46 → 2912.90] That's why I said it probably don't work as well.
[2914.30 → 2914.70] Unfortunate.
[2915.30 → 2915.48] Yeah.
[2917.60 → 2918.64] Don't quote me on that,
[2918.70 → 2919.80] but I'm pretty sure that's true.
[2920.04 → 2920.20] So.
[2920.50 → 2921.46] I did not know that.
[2921.46 → 2923.14] I have not thought about,
[2923.14 → 2924.34] or dove into that,
[2924.40 → 2925.92] so I'm going to refrain from making contact.
[2926.22 → 2926.46] Yes,
[2926.58 → 2927.52] and that's why I said,
[2928.30 → 2929.22] don't quote me on that.
[2929.50 → 2931.24] There's a quote at the end of this article that says,
[2931.34 → 2935.36] most healthy individuals are uncomfortable with the idea of having a doctor crack open their skull.
[2935.46 → 2936.24] That might be true,
[2936.30 → 2938.98] unless you're me and our giant fanboy of Elon Musk.
[2939.92 → 2940.42] If he's like,
[2940.48 → 2941.22] this is a good idea,
[2941.30 → 2941.90] I have done it,
[2941.90 → 2942.46] I will be like,
[2943.02 → 2944.68] so shall I.
[2945.36 → 2945.84] What is it?
[2945.84 → 2947.10] Maybe it's not even a chip.
[2947.22 → 2947.46] Maybe,
[2947.52 → 2950.80] maybe there'll be like nanites that you can just inject right here,
[2951.00 → 2952.68] and they'll just sort of migrate to your brain.
[2953.20 → 2953.54] See,
[2953.76 → 2954.90] I would be down for that too.
[2954.90 → 2955.72] Go both arms.
[2955.78 → 2955.96] Yeah.
[2956.16 → 2956.44] Yeah.
[2956.76 → 2957.44] Strap them up.
[2957.44 → 2957.62] Yeah,
[2957.70 → 2959.36] that's how it works.
[2959.40 → 2960.66] If you have twice as many nanites,
[2960.72 → 2963.14] you'll be twice as good at whatever it is you're trying to improve at.
[2963.22 → 2963.54] But yeah,
[2963.68 → 2963.92] yeah.
[2964.24 → 2964.38] No,
[2964.42 → 2966.00] I'm also weird where like,
[2966.20 → 2969.62] even before I started having intense knee problems,
[2969.82 → 2971.74] being like really into sprinting and stuff,
[2971.84 → 2976.34] I would look at the guys that unfortunately were amputees at the knee,
[2976.50 → 2979.46] and get like those curved metal legs.
[2979.54 → 2979.70] Yeah,
[2979.70 → 2983.80] and how they're like so much faster with envy.
[2984.56 → 2984.76] Like,
[2984.90 → 2986.20] I want to be that fast.
[2986.20 → 2986.52] Yeah.
[2986.88 → 2987.48] It's like,
[2987.76 → 2988.36] take them off.
[2988.46 → 2988.70] Human,
[2988.86 → 2989.32] but better.
[2989.48 → 2989.76] Yeah.
[2989.90 → 2990.06] Yeah.
[2990.32 → 2990.84] I'm,
[2990.90 → 2991.20] I'm,
[2991.44 → 2992.42] yeah.
[2992.56 → 2993.70] I was talking to John earlier.
[2993.80 → 2995.16] I am not Adam Jensen.
[2995.92 → 2997.30] Adam Jensen wakes up and goes,
[2997.40 → 2998.30] I didn't ask for this.
[2998.36 → 2999.10] I wake up and go,
[2999.20 → 2999.66] oh damn,
[2999.76 → 3000.08] thanks.
[3000.64 → 3001.08] Yeah.
[3001.44 → 3001.84] Like,
[3002.02 → 3002.66] I'm down.
[3002.86 → 3003.26] Exactly.
[3003.44 → 3003.64] Yeah.
[3004.00 → 3005.92] When this body dies,
[3006.24 → 3007.32] hopefully I have another.
[3008.40 → 3009.08] I don't care.
[3009.26 → 3010.30] I just want my consciousness.
[3010.98 → 3012.10] I'm trying to think like,
[3012.16 → 3015.34] what the most appropriate application of your consciousness on cyberspace would be.
[3015.34 → 3015.82] Probably like,
[3015.82 → 3017.50] adjudicating memes or something like that.
[3019.34 → 3019.78] Like,
[3019.84 → 3020.16] yes.
[3020.30 → 3020.52] Like,
[3020.58 → 3020.80] like,
[3020.88 → 3023.42] like know your meme could just like,
[3023.60 → 3025.58] assimilate your consciousness or,
[3025.64 → 3027.46] or maybe even like compensate you somehow.
[3027.58 → 3028.86] I have no idea how that would work,
[3028.92 → 3029.26] but yeah.
[3029.92 → 3030.36] Anyway.
[3030.36 → 3031.00] Um,
[3031.00 → 3034.32] you wouldn't need much compensation just for some digital services,
[3034.32 → 3034.74] I guess.
[3035.18 → 3039.02] You'd have to pay for the storage in some way.
[3039.02 → 3041.80] So like Dropbox or AWS storage of some kind,
[3041.88 → 3042.44] probably AWS.
[3043.00 → 3044.40] Instead of giving you,
[3044.44 → 3044.66] uh,
[3044.66 → 3046.16] the BC medical services plan,
[3046.24 → 3048.40] you would get like free malware scans and stuff like that.
[3048.40 → 3048.60] Yeah.
[3048.64 → 3049.96] Because you would be just code.
[3050.12 → 3050.82] That's a good call.
[3051.12 → 3051.36] Yeah.
[3051.76 → 3052.00] Yeah.
[3052.00 → 3055.18] You'd probably want to pay for certain services like Netflix.
[3055.52 → 3058.64] So you could just immediately watch every single movie that they have.
[3058.78 → 3059.32] Oh yeah.
[3059.50 → 3059.72] Yeah.
[3059.72 → 3061.16] I guess you could do that if you were code.
[3062.20 → 3062.56] Hey,
[3062.60 → 3063.92] what else do we have on the doc anyway?
[3064.14 → 3065.20] I don't think there's a ton else.
[3065.30 → 3066.52] We're coming to the end of the show.
[3066.64 → 3066.78] Oh,
[3066.86 → 3068.50] this is why this conversation is going worse.
[3068.50 → 3068.90] Yes.
[3069.06 → 3069.42] Yes.
[3069.54 → 3069.70] No,
[3069.70 → 3070.00] that's fine.
[3070.00 → 3070.66] That's actually pretty much it.
[3070.84 → 3072.18] There are a couple other things.
[3072.30 → 3074.72] It wasn't a super intense week in terms of news.
[3074.84 → 3076.90] It was a super intense week in terms of Scrapyard Wars,
[3077.10 → 3080.84] but you guys aren't going to be able to see that for a while,
[3081.26 → 3082.46] a while at the least.
[3082.88 → 3084.24] Those take a while to edit.
[3084.36 → 3086.56] I believe Ed is already working on it,
[3086.88 → 3092.50] but just like ingesting that much footage onto our server is a feat in itself
[3092.50 → 3095.50] because there are multiple days of tons and tons of footage.
[3095.50 → 3096.34] Um,
[3096.34 → 3101.52] and then he needs to go through, and I believe it's called shot logging instead
[3101.52 → 3102.24] of shot listing.
[3102.24 → 3103.30] Because they were already done.
[3103.46 → 3104.32] Not really sure how that works,
[3104.40 → 3109.14] but he has to like to build the story arc out of shots and then pick what shots
[3109.14 → 3112.16] are actually worth using and what shots aren't really worth using.
[3112.16 → 3116.54] And then try to chop those out and figure out how many episodes we can squish
[3116.54 → 3119.00] it into reasonably figure out the episode time,
[3119.14 → 3120.42] start editing them all,
[3120.52 → 3123.14] get them all into rough cuts so we can kind of see how far they're going to go
[3123.14 → 3125.20] and so on and so forth.
[3125.20 → 3126.08] So I don't know.
[3126.08 → 3128.90] Samsung 34 foot H,
[3129.18 → 3129.42] uh,
[3129.50 → 3134.26] HK 34 foot 4k HDR LED display for movie theatres.
[3135.00 → 3135.84] Super crazy.

[3139.34 → 3141.64] I guess I chopped in his name with it,
[3141.64 → 3142.58] um,
[3142.58 → 3143.30] on the forum.
[3143.40 → 3144.22] So we're going to jump there.
[3144.88 → 3146.10] I don't know if this,
[3146.22 → 3147.52] we're going to jump to hot hardware, actually.
[3147.70 → 3150.94] I don't know if they have an actual picture of it.
[3150.94 → 3153.90] I don't know if that is it or not.
[3155.06 → 3158.46] Samsung is touting a near infinity to one.
[3158.54 → 3160.16] I'm quoting them contrast ratio.
[3162.32 → 3162.76] Pretty.
[3162.90 → 3163.56] That's a pretty bold.
[3163.66 → 3164.92] That's a very bold claim.
[3165.04 → 3165.84] It is very bold.
[3165.84 → 3169.62] I believe this is the first time that movie theatres would have HDR,
[3170.22 → 3171.66] which is pretty cool.
[3171.86 → 3172.06] Uh,
[3172.06 → 3173.56] I don't know if I've said this on the WAN show before,
[3173.66 → 3177.18] but the first time that I ever saw HDR was at the NVIDIA suite.
[3177.46 → 3181.22] And I mentioned how HDR can actually make you feel slightly uncomfortable.
[3181.44 → 3182.24] Have I talked to you about this?
[3182.32 → 3182.58] No.
[3182.58 → 3183.02] Um,
[3183.02 → 3186.26] the NVIDIA guy really didn't like me bringing this up.
[3186.54 → 3186.90] Um,
[3186.96 → 3189.50] he was notably upset.
[3189.86 → 3190.34] Uh,
[3190.38 → 3196.68] but they had a very dark scene with a like bright light in the middle.
[3196.96 → 3198.74] And it did show off how it's like,
[3198.88 → 3199.30] Oh wow,
[3199.38 → 3202.30] that is a bright light instead of just a white spot on the screen.
[3202.52 → 3203.92] But because of that,
[3203.94 → 3207.96] it was so bright and everything else was so dark that it was actually like,
[3208.36 → 3208.86] Whoa.
[3209.22 → 3209.52] Yeah.
[3209.80 → 3211.30] And like normally in movies,
[3211.30 → 3211.50] like,
[3211.58 → 3211.64] Oh,
[3211.66 → 3212.42] you see an explosion,
[3212.42 → 3214.04] you see whatever it's all going on,
[3214.04 → 3217.40] but it's not going to like to make you pull back.
[3217.44 → 3218.68] It's not going to like to hurt your eyes.
[3218.68 → 3218.98] Really?
[3219.38 → 3219.80] Uh,
[3219.82 → 3220.82] this was like a
[3220.90 → 3223.82] it was an uncomfortable part of the screen to look at because it was so
[3223.82 → 3225.12] bright compared to everything else.
[3225.40 → 3225.76] Um,
[3226.18 → 3226.72] but yeah,
[3226.80 → 3227.20] anyway,
[3227.32 → 3231.06] it'll be 4096 by 21 or do.
[3231.84 → 3232.04] Yeah.
[3232.16 → 3232.54] By 20,
[3232.64 → 3234.50] 4096 by 2160 resolution.
[3235.22 → 3235.74] Um,
[3235.78 → 3236.76] and the
[3236.86 → 3237.60] it's peak brightness.
[3237.72 → 3238.68] And this is what I'm talking about.
[3238.68 → 3242.08] It's peak brightness will level at 10 times higher.
[3242.08 → 3247.90] The standard cinema projectors at 146 FL compared to 14.
[3247.90 → 3248.64] FL.
[3248.64 → 3249.14] I'm guessing,
[3249.28 → 3254.04] guessing this is advantageous for like dark scenes where it may be hard to tell things apart.
[3254.36 → 3255.04] Detail levels.
[3255.04 → 3255.28] Yeah,
[3255.28 → 3255.66] exactly.
[3255.66 → 3256.10] Yeah.
[3257.30 → 3257.70] Yeah.
[3257.86 → 3258.54] But like,
[3258.60 → 3259.40] I don't know.
[3259.48 → 3263.00] It's going to be pretty interesting because I think you're going to get a lot more of the
[3263.16 → 3265.20] like something happens on screen and the whole audience goes,
[3265.46 → 3265.84] Oh,
[3265.96 → 3266.78] kind of effect.
[3266.78 → 3267.78] because if it goes,
[3267.88 → 3268.44] if there's like,
[3268.64 → 3272.98] if you're in a really dark room, and it's like a horror scene and someone's like sitting in the chair, and they like,
[3273.02 → 3273.70] don't know what's going on.
[3273.76 → 3274.16] Then all of a sudden,
[3274.26 → 3275.90] like the lamp turns on right beside them.
[3276.16 → 3279.44] Like that's actually going to be a really like withdrawing moment.
[3279.44 → 3281.08] Because it's going to be really freaking bright.
[3281.28 → 3282.20] It sounds like that,
[3282.20 → 3282.44] um,
[3282.52 → 3283.48] THX noise.
[3283.48 → 3284.48] Yeah.
[3288.48 → 3288.84] Yeah.
[3289.00 → 3290.54] Pretty much with that.
[3291.20 → 3292.30] I think the show is over.
[3292.48 → 3293.86] So time to roll the intro,
[3294.04 → 3294.46] I guess.
[3294.66 → 3295.02] Outro.
[3295.38 → 3295.82] Outro.
[3296.28 → 3296.54] Yeah.
[3296.62 → 3297.20] It's the intro,
[3297.34 → 3297.86] but we're,
[3297.86 → 3299.30] we're introducing the end of the show.
[3299.46 → 3299.68] Yeah.
[3299.80 → 3302.72] It's also the exact same thing that we play at the beginning of the show.
[3302.84 → 3303.32] That's true.
[3303.46 → 3307.42] I've always kind of thought that we should maybe have like a slightly different one for the end of the show.
[3307.76 → 3309.66] Like maybe we pick up the couch and leave.
[3311.58 → 3312.40] Let's make that happen.
[3312.66 → 3313.06] Holy crap.
[3313.06 → 3314.24] That's a great idea.
[3314.38 → 3315.60] That actually totally makes sense.
[3316.38 → 3317.66] Which wouldn't even be that hard to do.
[3317.70 → 3318.68] Because we could just do it in reverse.
[3320.34 → 3322.70] Linus finally actually picks up the couch and helps me carry it out.
[3322.76 → 3324.64] Instead of just dropping it every single time.
[3324.70 → 3324.86] Yeah.
[3324.86 → 3325.86] Why don't we make that happen?
[3326.10 → 3327.22] I feel like that wouldn't be hard to do.
[3327.36 → 3327.58] Alright.
[3339.28 → 3340.00] Put it right here.
[3341.34 → 3341.66] Yeah.
[3341.86 → 3342.64] Just reverse this.
[3342.64 → 3346.06] Or maybe you could just keep walking to the end.
[3346.50 → 3348.22] And just like go out of frame.
[3348.70 → 3348.90] Whatever.
[3348.90 → 3349.68] I'm out of here.
[3350.24 → 3350.46] Anyway.
[3351.16 → 3352.14] Moss cables.
[3352.68 → 3353.24] Cables bags.
[3353.32 → 3353.76] Organizers.
[3354.62 → 3354.88] Put it.
[3355.14 → 3355.80] Get them at the thing.
[3356.76 → 3357.26] So tech.
[3358.40 → 3361.08] They make graphics cards and small computers and backpacks.
[3361.26 → 3362.00] Crazy stuff.
[3363.10 → 3363.34] Okay.
[3363.40 → 3363.70] Goodbye.
[3363.70 → 3366.02] I forgot where the button is.
[3366.76 → 3367.20] Oh god.
[3367.20 → 3368.04] There we go.
