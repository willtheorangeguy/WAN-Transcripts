[0.00 → 14.56] We've been live for a bit.
[14.96 → 19.22] We were just, you know, we were having like a contemplative moment.
[20.36 → 22.02] Did you know that whole time?
[22.30 → 22.50] Yeah.
[22.64 → 23.72] You just let that happen?
[23.72 → 24.04] Yeah, yeah.
[24.12 → 26.06] I was watching you over here on the monitor.
[26.46 → 29.06] I was just like, he's just so majestic.
[30.00 → 35.24] So we've got a great show for you guys today.
[35.40 → 37.88] It's actually been a heck of a week.
[38.50 → 45.68] I don't know what you've been doing, but I've been travelling to the faraway land of Toronto, Canada.
[46.24 → 47.56] That's so majestic.
[49.44 → 50.58] All manner of majestic.
[50.58 → 51.88] Who were you visiting with?
[52.20 → 52.72] Tell the people.
[53.14 → 54.16] Dad Mao Seiko.
[54.70 → 55.92] Dad Mao Seiko.
[55.98 → 56.24] Yeah.
[56.84 → 57.88] Did you call him that?
[58.10 → 59.20] No, I did not.
[60.00 → 63.50] I went with Joel.
[63.72 → 64.82] I figured that was pretty sick.
[65.02 → 65.26] Okay, cool.
[65.38 → 65.52] Yeah.
[66.36 → 66.92] All right.
[66.98 → 69.72] So we've got a lot of great topics for you guys today.
[69.86 → 72.36] AMD announces Thread Ripper.
[74.22 → 75.32] Dun, dun, dun.
[76.36 → 77.34] Pretty sick name.
[77.34 → 82.64] The chip formerly known as Naples with a far more controversial name.
[83.10 → 83.80] What else we got?
[84.80 → 91.24] Well, Destiny 2 is going to be exclusively on Battle.net, which is actually kind of interesting
[91.24 → 96.04] because I believe before they were saying Steam or just open to everything.
[96.04 → 105.50] And Wanna Cry has only collected $92,000 in ransom, which considering the scope they're on is really not very much.
[105.68 → 106.64] We'll talk about that later.
[106.96 → 107.28] Wow.
[107.66 → 108.14] Crazy.
[108.84 → 109.32] Wild.
[110.44 → 110.92] Fantastical.
[110.92 → 112.44] Oh, I just almost turned off the screen.
[112.46 → 113.80] You almost stopped the whole thing.
[113.80 → 116.38] I'm actually like my brain is pretty tired.
[117.02 → 117.96] Like I did.
[118.12 → 121.64] I went three hours one way and three hours the other way.
[121.82 → 122.10] And like.
[122.14 → 123.42] Which is like not enough to.
[123.56 → 125.32] 56 hours kind of thing.
[125.40 → 125.56] Yeah.
[125.56 → 129.84] And like generally speaking, I handle the time zone shift pretty well.
[130.16 → 136.52] But I also was up till 3 a.m. Eastern time.
[136.80 → 137.40] No, Western.
[137.50 → 138.84] Western time still.
[139.30 → 140.06] So like 6 a.m.
[140.06 → 141.12] No, don't stop the stream.
[141.26 → 142.46] No, I'm not going to stop the stream.
[143.08 → 143.74] Savage Jerky.
[143.74 → 144.68] Thank you, Savage Jerky.
[144.72 → 146.22] Maybe you'll wake Linus up.
[147.50 → 148.22] Fresh books.
[149.14 → 151.36] And also the Tech Carnival.
[151.98 → 152.34] Hooray.
[152.62 → 153.90] Do we know how many tickets we sold for that?
[153.90 → 156.04] People ask me all the time.
[156.12 → 157.38] And I'm like, I don't know.
[157.60 → 159.32] But I could find out.
[160.06 → 161.52] Yeah, I could definitely find out.
[161.62 → 163.90] I'm going to ask Hippy Pee.
[166.12 → 169.64] I love that guy.
[169.72 → 170.18] He's awesome.
[170.78 → 171.14] All right.
[171.20 → 171.82] Well, why don't we jump.
[171.82 → 172.66] Now that he's not doing the WAND OCK.
[172.70 → 172.88] Okay.
[172.96 → 173.30] Do you want to.
[173.78 → 174.14] Yeah.
[174.56 → 174.74] Yeah.
[175.58 → 176.68] All is forgiven.
[177.44 → 177.66] Yeah.
[177.82 → 178.10] Okay.
[178.18 → 179.60] So should I talk about my trip?
[179.60 → 181.40] Do you want to talk about what you've been up to this week?
[181.46 → 182.68] Or should we get into actual news?
[182.96 → 183.10] Okay.
[183.10 → 185.00] Because I want to know about your trip.
[185.02 → 189.58] So I signed an NDA the minute I walked into the studio.
[189.84 → 190.12] Really?
[190.44 → 190.82] Yes.
[192.06 → 192.46] What?
[192.78 → 194.10] So I can tell you that much.
[195.56 → 195.96] What?
[196.08 → 196.32] Okay.
[196.40 → 197.06] I will tell you.
[197.16 → 198.96] I will tell you think that I'm allowed to tell you.
[199.02 → 200.68] Because like, here's the thing.
[200.82 → 201.06] What?
[201.28 → 202.36] What are you even working on?
[202.40 → 203.28] I guess you can't say.
[203.52 → 206.34] His studio is like his house.
[206.34 → 207.72] So like.
[208.06 → 208.26] Oh.
[208.60 → 210.62] So he doesn't want you to talk about like.
[210.66 → 211.28] So I.
[211.28 → 211.72] His house.
[211.88 → 212.52] I like.
[213.08 → 214.00] Met people.
[214.50 → 214.86] And like.
[214.86 → 215.48] So it was an NDA.
[215.62 → 215.98] But like.
[216.04 → 217.24] The people that were there.
[217.32 → 218.38] And the stuff that was there.
[219.14 → 219.50] Oh.
[219.62 → 219.92] Yeah.
[220.04 → 220.14] Like.
[220.26 → 220.74] I thought it was an NDA.
[220.74 → 221.54] But what you were doing.
[221.62 → 221.84] I was like.
[222.00 → 223.38] I sort of think I know what you're doing.
[223.48 → 224.46] And it's not that scary.
[224.46 → 226.50] It's an NDA of like.
[226.62 → 230.28] Making sure that you properly respect someone's privacy.
[230.62 → 230.82] Yeah.
[230.94 → 232.16] Who is a public figure.
[232.32 → 232.56] Yeah.
[232.72 → 233.06] And.
[233.32 → 233.92] So that's cool.
[234.04 → 234.58] Totally makes sense.
[234.66 → 236.06] So there's a separate release.
[236.06 → 237.40] That we're going to get signed.
[237.54 → 239.52] For everything that we're publishing.
[240.04 → 241.62] From the piece that we did.
[241.94 → 242.12] Okay.
[242.12 → 242.92] And then like.
[243.12 → 244.32] He gets to sign off on it.
[244.40 → 244.86] But like.
[245.26 → 246.82] Basically what I can say.
[247.02 → 247.88] Is that.
[248.32 → 248.76] Joel.
[249.60 → 250.08] Zimmerman.
[250.14 → 250.58] A.K.A.
[250.70 → 251.26] Deadmau5.
[251.92 → 253.26] Super chill guy.
[253.46 → 253.62] Yeah.
[253.62 → 255.44] We were supposed to be there.
[255.66 → 256.44] From one.
[256.76 → 257.56] Until like.
[257.80 → 258.84] The end of the work day.
[260.20 → 261.96] We didn't leave.
[262.10 → 263.74] Until the wee hours of the morning.
[264.30 → 264.82] Just.
[265.40 → 265.92] Like.
[266.24 → 267.06] Shooting the shit.
[267.48 → 267.88] That's cool.
[268.02 → 269.02] And working on.
[269.12 → 270.00] Working on our video.
[270.38 → 271.00] And just like.
[271.06 → 271.92] That's actually really cool.
[272.00 → 273.12] The guy is.
[273.56 → 274.12] So there's.
[274.20 → 275.32] There's a huge difference.
[275.40 → 277.86] Between people that are famous.
[277.86 → 278.96] For like.
[281.44 → 281.96] For.
[282.12 → 282.60] For like.
[282.68 → 283.44] Being famous.
[283.44 → 284.06] I guess.
[284.26 → 285.04] Like socialites.
[285.22 → 286.46] And people who are.
[286.66 → 287.48] People who are famous.
[287.48 → 288.48] For just like.
[288.76 → 289.24] Really.
[289.50 → 289.78] Really.
[289.92 → 290.70] Caring deeply.
[290.70 → 291.80] About their craft.
[292.22 → 292.98] And the guy's.
[293.10 → 294.80] A gigantic geek.
[295.36 → 295.72] Like.
[295.98 → 296.16] Yeah.
[296.16 → 297.18] Such a nerd.
[297.32 → 298.18] I've thought about.
[298.46 → 299.84] Getting his master class.
[300.40 → 301.60] Not because I want to learn.
[301.66 → 302.66] How to actually do that stuff.
[302.72 → 304.12] Because I would be horrible at it.
[304.16 → 304.88] We both know this.
[304.88 → 305.82] Um.
[306.10 → 307.84] But I think it would just be interesting to watch.
[307.94 → 308.54] Because I like.
[308.80 → 310.74] Watching people that are that passionate about something.
[310.82 → 311.60] Just talk about it.
[311.78 → 311.94] Yep.
[312.06 → 312.50] And so.
[312.62 → 312.96] And it's.
[313.02 → 313.70] It's what's cool.
[313.70 → 316.00] Is that no matter how basic of a thing.
[316.10 → 316.90] We were talking about.
[317.04 → 317.82] Because for me.
[318.82 → 320.00] Electronic music is.
[320.34 → 320.38] Like.
[320.38 → 321.66] Explain like I'm five.
[321.78 → 322.28] Pretty much.
[322.42 → 322.58] Yeah.
[322.64 → 324.34] I don't know much about the scene.
[324.44 → 325.98] I don't know much about the artists.
[326.14 → 326.46] I.
[326.46 → 326.78] I had.
[326.86 → 328.02] I confessed it to him.
[328.40 → 329.16] I was just like.
[330.18 → 330.62] So.
[330.82 → 332.36] As part of my research.
[332.36 → 333.96] And due diligence for this trip.
[334.30 → 334.70] I.
[335.16 → 336.94] Put you into Google Play Music.
[336.94 → 337.44] And like.
[337.48 → 338.82] Listened to some of your music.
[339.26 → 341.08] I legitimately have listened to a lot of his stuff.
[341.26 → 341.36] And.
[341.36 → 342.18] Like probably everything.
[342.24 → 343.22] And the funny thing about it.
[343.26 → 343.80] Is he was.
[344.10 → 344.42] Just.
[344.84 → 345.98] Crazy chill about.
[346.20 → 346.42] Even.
[346.64 → 347.16] Even like.
[347.38 → 347.90] Like for me.
[347.90 → 348.96] That's pretty embarrassing.
[349.28 → 349.90] But it's less embarrassing.
[349.90 → 352.02] Less embarrassing for me to admit it up front.
[352.36 → 352.56] Right.
[352.68 → 354.10] Than for him to be like.
[355.20 → 355.60] You know.
[355.72 → 356.08] Something.
[356.20 → 356.52] Something.
[357.00 → 357.36] Something.
[358.12 → 358.60] This specific track.
[358.60 → 359.68] What do you think of this song?
[359.76 → 360.24] And me being like.
[360.28 → 360.38] Oh.
[360.40 → 361.16] Is it one of yours?
[361.58 → 362.26] And it's like.
[362.36 → 363.10] Ghosts and stuff.
[363.22 → 363.58] Or something.
[364.92 → 365.28] Okay.
[365.48 → 366.02] Good reference.
[366.14 → 366.70] There you go.
[366.74 → 366.90] All right.
[366.90 → 367.92] Because Google Play Music.
[368.14 → 369.46] Conveniently sorts by popular.
[369.72 → 369.90] So like.
[369.90 → 370.06] Yeah.
[370.32 → 370.56] Okay.
[370.64 → 371.00] So when.
[371.26 → 371.44] When.
[372.76 → 373.50] So when.
[374.76 → 376.34] When we were looking at some stuff.
[376.44 → 377.30] That I can't talk about.
[377.42 → 378.40] But that is really cool.
[378.48 → 379.40] And it's going to be in the video.
[379.40 → 380.30] So like.
[380.44 → 382.44] I recognized things.
[382.86 → 383.28] And that was.
[383.28 → 383.86] That was good.
[383.94 → 385.34] When we used to have lands.
[385.66 → 387.32] One song that we could play.
[387.32 → 388.34] Like on the speakers.
[388.64 → 389.84] Because my parents.
[390.08 → 390.72] And my friends.
[390.72 → 391.32] And me.
[391.46 → 392.28] All liked it.
[392.40 → 393.44] Was a dead mouse song.
[393.50 → 394.14] And it was strobe.
[394.66 → 394.92] Okay.
[395.00 → 395.58] I don't know that one.
[395.58 → 396.24] But like.
[396.32 → 396.54] Like.
[396.62 → 397.60] It's just kind of funny.
[397.74 → 397.98] That like.
[398.04 → 399.16] Out of all the music.
[399.16 → 400.52] Between all the different genres.
[400.52 → 401.50] That all the people liked.
[401.58 → 402.06] That these like.
[402.34 → 403.12] Huge lands.
[403.12 → 403.92] With lots of people.
[404.02 → 405.50] It ended up being some dead mouse songs.
[405.66 → 405.90] Right.
[406.04 → 407.12] That were the easiest to play.
[407.82 → 408.18] So.
[408.34 → 408.70] So yeah.
[408.78 → 408.92] No.
[408.92 → 410.04] It was really fun.
[410.04 → 411.64] He's super cool.
[411.90 → 414.62] We spent the entire day there.
[415.24 → 416.28] And basically.
[416.28 → 418.20] It's going to be like a studio tour.
[418.54 → 422.08] But not like most people would go in.
[422.28 → 424.02] And do a studio tour with dead mouse.
[424.38 → 424.88] In fact.
[424.96 → 425.96] In some ways.
[425.96 → 428.36] I think me not being a rabid fanboy.
[428.90 → 430.58] It probably helped us.
[430.82 → 431.86] Approach his studio.
[432.16 → 433.20] A little bit differently.
[433.32 → 433.88] Because I think.
[434.54 → 435.12] You know.
[436.32 → 437.84] What would a typical person do?
[437.92 → 438.44] They'd walk in.
[438.48 → 438.88] They'd be like.
[439.06 → 439.90] Can you wear the hat?
[441.30 → 441.62] Right.
[442.08 → 442.88] That's kind of lame.
[443.38 → 443.94] And so.
[444.24 → 444.28] And.
[444.30 → 446.62] I would actually specifically want him to not put the hat on.
[446.72 → 447.70] So instead.
[448.60 → 448.92] You know.
[448.98 → 450.18] We're looking at.
[450.60 → 451.04] Ah.
[451.22 → 451.54] Like.
[451.58 → 452.72] I don't know what I can say.
[452.80 → 453.46] What I can't say.
[453.46 → 453.66] Like.
[453.76 → 455.36] Some G-series SSL.
[455.36 → 456.88] I'm sure he'd be cool about it.
[456.96 → 457.32] But like.
[457.42 → 459.30] We're looking at the tech behind.
[460.20 → 461.44] How he does things.
[461.66 → 461.72] Yeah.
[462.20 → 463.84] He even does like a short.
[463.94 → 464.86] So because I was like.
[464.94 → 465.14] Okay.
[465.26 → 467.30] Explain like I'm completely stupid.
[467.80 → 469.76] How electronic music works.
[470.10 → 471.70] And he actually does.
[471.70 → 472.02] Like.
[472.12 → 472.30] Like.
[472.44 → 472.68] Like.
[472.68 → 473.70] Like a kindergarten level.
[475.22 → 475.66] Like.
[475.84 → 476.20] Demo.
[476.34 → 476.98] Live demo.
[477.60 → 478.54] Super cool.
[478.64 → 479.14] That's awesome.
[479.32 → 479.80] It'll be.
[479.90 → 481.76] It'll be great for anyone like me.
[481.86 → 483.40] I am personally really stoked to watch this video.
[483.46 → 483.48] Who's like.
[484.06 → 484.98] Electronic music.
[484.98 → 486.16] Is like that kind of.
[487.66 → 488.10] Like.
[488.24 → 488.90] It's that.
[489.08 → 490.22] But what does that mean?
[490.36 → 490.60] And.
[490.74 → 492.62] And we get this very basic explanation of it.
[492.68 → 493.24] It's really awesome.
[493.36 → 493.78] That's cool.
[494.12 → 495.08] So what were you up to?
[495.62 → 497.12] I was grading projects.
[497.32 → 498.58] I was trying to.
[499.04 → 500.20] Finalize contracts.
[500.20 → 500.80] With people.
[500.94 → 501.72] About things.
[502.58 → 503.32] I was.
[503.72 → 504.12] Modernizing.
[504.12 → 504.60] Something.
[504.60 → 505.70] That I'm not going to mention.
[507.44 → 508.94] What the heck else did I do?
[509.72 → 510.42] Meeting with.
[510.64 → 511.70] Multiple accountants.
[512.22 → 512.56] About.
[512.56 → 513.16] Weird.
[513.34 → 514.48] Really annoying stuff.
[515.24 → 515.72] Um.
[516.24 → 516.90] One of which.
[517.00 → 517.20] Like.
[517.44 → 518.24] Wants me to.
[518.32 → 520.30] This is going to go a little bit too deep into personal stuff.
[520.30 → 520.72] Oh shoot.
[520.82 → 523.10] We called the stupid stream after party.
[523.26 → 523.52] Ah.
[524.06 → 524.66] Dang it.
[524.88 → 525.38] Carry on.
[525.38 → 526.60] One of them.
[526.78 → 526.96] No.
[527.06 → 529.48] I told both of them that I'm a US and Canadian citizen.
[529.80 → 530.78] And one of them like.
[531.42 → 532.52] Very aggressively.
[533.04 → 534.94] Wanted me to move to the states.
[535.16 → 536.62] Renounce my Canadian citizenship.
[537.00 → 537.62] And get.
[538.34 → 540.04] Convince you guys that.
[540.48 → 541.92] Floatplanes should move to the states.
[541.98 → 542.78] And all this kind of stuff.
[542.80 → 543.00] What?
[543.26 → 543.44] What?
[543.56 → 545.84] And like had a giant picture of Trump on his wall.
[545.90 → 547.22] It was a really weird meeting.
[547.88 → 548.14] Um.
[548.76 → 549.16] Yeah.
[549.56 → 550.08] It was.
[550.22 → 552.08] A lot of weird stuff happened this week.
[552.08 → 555.10] That's probably how I'd frame that to be completely honest.
[559.30 → 560.18] But yeah.
[560.32 → 560.84] There you go.
[561.44 → 561.92] Okay.
[562.64 → 563.04] Um.
[563.34 → 563.78] Sure.
[563.96 → 564.10] Anyway.
[564.10 → 564.50] Try it out.
[564.60 → 564.94] Okay.
[565.08 → 566.72] I actually tried out a really wicked keyboard.
[566.98 → 567.34] Okay.
[567.60 → 568.00] Uh.
[568.00 → 570.06] It's a pre-release keyboard from Wu Ting.
[570.72 → 570.88] Okay.
[570.88 → 572.06] And we're making a video on it.
[572.18 → 573.62] But it's the optical key switches.
[573.92 → 576.64] Where it's like an analog gradient as you go down.
[576.86 → 577.04] Ah.
[577.04 → 579.08] So you can be like steering wheel driving with it.
[579.08 → 580.32] So we finally got one of those in.
[580.32 → 582.88] I think we requested one like ages ago.
[582.90 → 583.08] Forever ago.
[583.18 → 585.82] And they said they didn't want to send me an early one.
[585.92 → 587.96] Because they were like we want to send you one when it's done.
[588.06 → 589.00] So you can see it when it's ready.
[589.16 → 589.32] Cool.
[589.32 → 590.76] And it's still an early one.
[590.88 → 592.78] Because I asked forever ago.
[592.90 → 595.56] I think around like Computer last year.
[596.28 → 596.94] And yeah.
[597.16 → 597.50] So whatever.
[597.52 → 598.54] It's Wu Ting.
[599.10 → 599.40] Like.
[599.46 → 599.66] Like.
[599.72 → 600.36] Wu T.
[600.62 → 601.00] Ting.
[601.34 → 602.36] Not Wu Tang.
[602.84 → 603.56] Did I say Wu Tang?
[603.64 → 604.36] No you didn't.
[604.42 → 604.56] Yeah.
[604.62 → 604.80] Okay.
[604.80 → 606.26] But Twitch chat it's like.
[606.58 → 607.40] Wu Tang.
[607.76 → 608.04] No.
[608.04 → 608.44] No.
[609.10 → 611.04] No it's not a Wu Tang keyboard.
[611.46 → 611.86] Yeah.
[612.86 → 613.90] Get out of here.
[616.56 → 616.84] All right.
[616.84 → 617.20] All right.
[617.20 → 618.50] He's making the wings behind us.
[618.50 → 618.58] Yeah.
[618.78 → 618.96] No.
[619.04 → 619.36] He can.
[619.42 → 619.80] He can.
[619.88 → 620.30] He can.
[620.36 → 620.98] He can go.
[621.08 → 621.78] He is dismissed.
[622.30 → 622.98] All right.
[623.26 → 623.58] Yeah.
[623.78 → 624.08] Let's.
[624.14 → 627.44] So this was originally posted on the forum by Doc Swag.
[627.44 → 630.06] I have more to talk about with Float plane.
[630.20 → 630.94] But I was thinking of lining it up for when we.
[630.94 → 630.98] Yeah.
[630.98 → 631.96] Let's do it on the after party.
[632.82 → 633.50] Or not.
[633.70 → 634.22] Well I also.
[634.34 → 637.40] I want to line it up for when we do the little bit of a teaser thing.
[637.46 → 637.66] Okay.
[637.72 → 637.88] Sure.
[638.06 → 638.24] Okay.
[638.48 → 638.80] All right.
[639.94 → 640.26] AMD.
[641.38 → 641.74] Oh.
[641.80 → 641.98] What?
[643.28 → 643.68] Oh.
[643.82 → 644.00] Oh.
[644.00 → 644.92] Did we move the.
[645.00 → 647.78] We moved the HDMI doodads around.
[647.90 → 648.22] Hold on.
[648.32 → 648.42] What?
[648.58 → 649.20] I'll be right back.
[649.82 → 650.20] Okay.
[650.56 → 651.50] Should I talk about it?
[651.50 → 651.66] Yeah.
[651.66 → 651.82] Yeah.
[651.82 → 654.92] AMD will be introducing stuff called Thread ripper.
[655.08 → 656.00] Ry zen Thread ripper.
[656.18 → 656.20] The.
[656.44 → 656.92] They are.
[657.08 → 657.32] AMD.
[657.80 → 658.32] Sorry.
[658.78 → 661.28] They'll have 16 cores and 32 threads.
[661.54 → 662.82] That's why they're called the Thread ripper.
[663.00 → 664.88] Which is just absolutely ridiculous.
[665.46 → 667.12] I believe there's a couple different.
[667.40 → 667.66] Yeah.
[667.76 → 670.64] There will be up to nine different Thread rippers.
[671.28 → 672.40] These are rumours.
[672.40 → 678.04] The 1998 X and 1998 with 16 cores.
[678.22 → 681.32] The 1977 X and 1977 with 14 cores.
[681.32 → 688.28] 1976 X and 1956 X and 1956 all have 12 cores.
[688.52 → 693.02] And then the 1955 X and 1955 with 10 cores.
[693.34 → 695.36] Why are they making this so complicated?
[695.88 → 697.12] It's a little messy.
[697.60 → 697.84] Okay.
[697.88 → 698.78] It's really messy.
[699.26 → 706.52] But having it be AM4 and being able to get 16 cores is pretty sick.
[707.24 → 709.28] So this is all.
[709.66 → 710.32] This is all.
[710.32 → 713.06] Oh, so these are claims from WCCF tech.
[713.14 → 713.94] Just to be clear.
[714.90 → 715.32] Wait.
[715.44 → 715.90] Hold on.
[716.38 → 722.12] And they're also saying that these Thread ripper CPUs won't be compatible with the AM4 socket.
[722.28 → 725.06] Which supports 1331 pins.
[725.62 → 729.42] But will demand a massive 4094 pin socket.
[729.42 → 730.44] Does it have a picture of it?
[730.44 → 732.12] Was that the Epic thing that he was holding?
[732.12 → 732.66] That was Epic.
[733.22 → 734.88] Although it wouldn't surprise me.
[734.88 → 734.98] No.
[735.76 → 743.48] It wouldn't surprise me if Thread ripper will look the same as Epic and fit in the same socket.
[743.48 → 746.94] So much like what Intel does with their high-end desktop.
[746.94 → 749.60] So their 2011 V3s.
[749.60 → 754.30] And their Leon platform, which also fits in socket 2011 V3.
[754.30 → 765.36] I'm expecting AMD to have their Epic line of server chips and their Thread ripper line of high-end desktop and or workstation chips exist on the same socket.
[765.48 → 767.78] So that will allow them to have more PCIe lanes.
[768.22 → 770.84] More pins for interfacing with more cores.
[770.84 → 774.36] Up to, I believe it is, 6-channel memory?
[775.92 → 776.76] I'll try to find that.
[776.80 → 779.06] I read that wrong and thought it was on a different socket.
[779.20 → 779.60] Sorry, guys.
[781.14 → 781.54] 6.
[781.70 → 782.66] I can't remember.
[782.74 → 785.06] Is there 8-channel memory or something stupid like that?
[785.08 → 785.60] I can't remember.
[785.68 → 788.02] I think it's 8-channel memory, actually, now that I think about it.
[789.68 → 793.02] And then the other thing is that...
[793.02 → 793.52] Okay.
[794.60 → 800.52] So what's interesting about this to me is that the way that Intel differentiates their Leon processors on LGTX,
[800.84 → 807.70] LGA20113, and their Core i7 processors on LGA20113 is a couple of things.
[807.76 → 810.24] And the main ones are dual socket support.
[810.76 → 815.88] So I would expect that that will continue to be a differentiator for AMD.
[816.32 → 823.90] But the other thing that Intel does to keep them separate from each other is support for ECC-registered memory on Leon.
[824.04 → 825.66] 16-channel DDR4 memory.
[825.88 → 826.92] 16-channel?
[826.92 → 830.92] I think that's 16-channel is to the dual...
[832.98 → 834.28] Wait, 16-channel?
[834.40 → 834.60] Wow.
[834.76 → 835.00] Okay.
[835.14 → 837.42] Well, maybe Twitch chat is correcting me on that.
[837.42 → 837.84] Oh, no.
[837.84 → 838.42] That's the Epic.
[838.42 → 839.16] So that's the Epic.
[839.34 → 841.78] So if you want 32 dims.
[844.18 → 844.98] So, yeah.
[845.84 → 847.92] But if the Epic is on the same platform...
[847.92 → 852.56] I guess that could be another way that they differentiate them.
[852.88 → 853.12] Right.
[854.26 → 854.92] So, yeah.
[855.00 → 855.58] So rumour.
[855.82 → 857.76] Rumour there will be up to nine Thread rippers.
[857.92 → 858.58] I really...
[858.58 → 862.64] I kind of hope they just call them Ry zen 9 to make life a little bit easier.
[863.12 → 868.88] And I really am not sure what I think of these convoluted kind of names for them.
[868.88 → 872.30] The 1998 X and 1998.
[874.72 → 876.00] Tell me this.
[876.20 → 879.38] 16 cores on a desktop.
[880.44 → 881.86] What's the value here?
[881.86 → 890.58] If you want to run, like, four Lime Tech systems on one system.
[890.96 → 892.64] So I'll let you in on a little secret.
[892.82 → 894.28] I've chatted with the Lime Tech boys.
[894.94 → 900.56] And so far, virtualization on Ry zen is not a great experience.
[900.92 → 901.76] But go ahead.
[901.86 → 902.28] Carry on.
[902.40 → 902.64] Okay.
[905.90 → 908.52] Streaming to a lot of places at one time.
[908.52 → 913.20] At a lot of different, like, output resolutions.
[913.54 → 913.80] Sure.
[914.00 → 917.48] And for some reason, you don't have, like, a separate box handling that.
[917.60 → 917.78] Yeah.
[918.90 → 919.30] Okay.
[919.36 → 919.98] What else you got?
[920.64 → 921.14] Not much.
[921.14 → 921.54] Cine bench.
[921.92 → 922.30] Sure.
[924.44 → 925.50] Amazing Cine bench.
[925.62 → 926.68] The best Cine bench.
[927.48 → 930.58] So we actually did a demo a little while ago.
[930.58 → 931.24] 3D rendering.
[932.44 → 932.92] Yeah.
[933.70 → 934.10] Yeah?
[934.24 → 934.50] Okay.
[934.72 → 935.58] So, like, workstation.
[935.98 → 936.54] Workstation, though.
[936.54 → 937.98] But he wasn't saying workstation.
[937.98 → 938.22] Yeah.
[938.30 → 942.28] Because, like, I'm talking, like, competition with high-end desktop.
[942.78 → 948.18] Like, to me, I'm kind of looking at Thread ripper going, this seems like a very niche product
[948.18 → 948.80] right now.
[948.80 → 954.80] Because Ry zen 7 already goes all the way up to eight quite high-performance cores.
[955.00 → 955.18] Yeah.
[955.18 → 962.32] Which, for desktop workloads, like, it's about, like, talking about how high-performance your
[962.32 → 970.04] SSD is when it requires Days of 16 in order to even, you know, differentiate itself from
[970.04 → 970.98] a low-end SSD.
[971.38 → 972.70] Like, that's what we're talking about.
[972.70 → 980.44] We're talking about a product with all this theoretical power, but that a desktop workload pretty much wouldn't touch.
[980.50 → 983.00] And to be clear, I am not complaining.
[983.80 → 991.34] The fact that AMD is coming in and putting pressure on Intel about core counts is great.
[991.34 → 995.68] But right now, I think the sweet spot is just six cores.
[995.68 → 1002.00] So a lot of people in chat are naming a lot of things that you could do with it that aren't the scenarios that Linus is talking about.
[1002.02 → 1002.14] Sure.
[1002.26 → 1004.16] A lot of what people are listing are workstations.
[1004.30 → 1004.92] I don't remember all of them.
[1004.92 → 1005.54] Oh, workstations.
[1005.54 → 1007.76] One of them was, like, SETI at home and stuff.
[1007.76 → 1008.58] No, that's not a...
[1008.58 → 1010.78] Which is, like, that's not necessarily a workstation.
[1011.14 → 1016.26] No, but it's not really, like, it's more like a power virus.
[1016.50 → 1019.82] It's less like an actual thing that you're sitting at your computer doing.
[1019.82 → 1020.06] Yeah.
[1020.20 → 1025.00] To be clear, it has a value, but most people...
[1025.00 → 1026.06] Remember, we're talking about...
[1026.06 → 1027.64] I've heard people say, like, cryptography and stuff.
[1028.70 → 1029.98] Who's actually doing that at home?
[1029.98 → 1031.36] I'm like, you're probably doing it with a GPU.
[1031.72 → 1033.50] And GPUs are a thing.
[1034.18 → 1034.54] Yeah.
[1035.12 → 1038.18] Another guy said Bitcoin mining, but, like, again...
[1038.18 → 1039.60] Yeah, I go with a graphics card.
[1040.46 → 1040.82] Yeah, or...
[1041.64 → 1043.30] Don't they have, like, ASIC...
[1043.30 → 1043.92] Video rendering?
[1044.06 → 1046.02] I'm out of date on the whole Bitcoin thing.
[1046.60 → 1049.58] Jake's trying to convince me to do, like, another Bitcoin...
[1049.58 → 1050.12] It's still...
[1050.12 → 1052.68] You still kind of just want to use your video card, though.
[1052.68 → 1052.88] Yeah.
[1053.04 → 1054.46] Oh, is it still just video cards?
[1054.54 → 1054.78] Okay.
[1055.06 → 1055.94] You know, it's just like...
[1055.94 → 1058.14] I think I'd like...
[1058.14 → 1059.76] I could be misinformed.
[1060.08 → 1067.94] So, basically, what I see as being positive about this is that it's putting pressure on Intel to...
[1068.76 → 1072.94] Finally give us more than four cores, and it's putting...
[1072.94 → 1073.76] No, it's not, apparently.
[1073.84 → 1074.52] Apparently, I'm wrong.
[1075.66 → 1076.82] Oh, GPUs are not a thing?
[1077.34 → 1078.58] Well, no, they still are.
[1079.58 → 1080.58] But...
[1080.58 → 1081.58] But...
[1083.58 → 1086.08] Yeah, I'm not sure.
[1086.42 → 1087.26] Um, okay.
[1087.66 → 1091.68] Now, let's talk about the chip formerly known as Naples.
[1092.26 → 1093.30] So...
[1093.30 → 1095.60] Here's what I don't get.
[1095.60 → 1109.46] Why is it that companies that have great codenames, like Zen Architecture and Naples product codename, which is, like, inoffensive?
[1109.64 → 1110.14] Unoffensive?
[1110.40 → 1111.26] It's not offensive.
[1111.52 → 1112.62] What's offensive about Epic?
[1114.10 → 1115.24] It's stupid.
[1115.92 → 1116.50] Yeah, okay.
[1116.50 → 1117.50] It's like...
[1117.50 → 1117.92] It's like...
[1117.92 → 1118.92] It's like you're...
[1118.92 → 1122.50] You're marketing this to, like, data centre professionals.
[1123.34 → 1125.14] Why are you calling it Epic?
[1125.56 → 1128.06] Why don't you just call it Leet while you're at it?
[1128.06 → 1131.82] Yeah.
[1132.82 → 1133.18] Yeah.
[1133.72 → 1134.00] Yeah.
[1134.16 → 1135.92] You said inoffensive, though.
[1136.66 → 1137.06] Okay, no, it's not...
[1137.06 → 1138.48] Like, Epic isn't offensive.
[1138.62 → 1139.50] It's not offensive.
[1139.84 → 1140.96] It's like...
[1140.96 → 1141.64] Um...
[1141.64 → 1143.44] It's just a little silly.
[1144.54 → 1149.92] I mean, to be clear, it's not like I necessarily have a better answer.
[1150.38 → 1156.44] And, like, it's possible they would have wanted to call it Zen Server or something.
[1156.54 → 1158.26] Like, I don't know what they wanted to call it.
[1158.26 → 1164.50] But there's always complications around, you know, trademark infringement and copyright and all that kind of stuff.
[1164.64 → 1167.42] So, you know, maybe that was the only thing left.
[1167.42 → 1168.54] Um...
[1168.54 → 1179.66] But unless it, like, stood for something really cool, then I don't really get this as, like, an enterprise-grade product.
[1180.18 → 1183.42] Now, with that said, we got a straw poll of this.
[1183.50 → 1189.48] Because I was going back and forth with another journalist this morning, actually, in Twitter DMs.
[1189.94 → 1193.68] And we were kind of debating this whole thing.
[1193.68 → 1193.98] You know what?
[1193.98 → 1197.96] Okay, I'm not going to say what side anybody was on.
[1198.04 → 1199.74] But it was Ian from Nantes.
[1199.92 → 1201.18] We were chatting about it.
[1201.58 → 1206.88] And the other side of the argument that got brought up was, okay, well, hold on a minute.
[1206.88 → 1215.76] What if your typical, like, data centre, you know, purchaser, you know, is...
[1215.76 → 1222.76] Goes home and watches anime and, like, plays video games and, like, thinks that things are epic.
[1223.58 → 1226.36] And, you know, like, is it really that far off?
[1227.32 → 1229.10] I don't think it would be that far off.
[1229.54 → 1232.26] Okay, so let's just straw poll this.
[1232.36 → 1232.60] Epic.
[1232.60 → 1232.76] Epic.
[1235.00 → 1236.38] You know, what is it to you?
[1236.38 → 1243.30] At the same time, personally, if I was purchasing this, I would worry about this being on an invoice that I would be handing to someone.
[1243.88 → 1245.26] Okay, okay, so...
[1245.26 → 1248.84] Because I would be like, maybe they just think I'm buying it because it's cool.
[1249.08 → 1250.58] It doesn't sound like...
[1250.58 → 1254.50] It sounds flashy, and it sounds like something in Toys R Us.
[1254.50 → 1257.90] It doesn't sound like serious infrastructure hardware.
[1258.22 → 1258.66] You know what I mean?
[1259.38 → 1266.30] Yeah, but, you know, with that said, it's not like some companies haven't had a ton of success with that.
[1266.42 → 1266.74] Oh, definitely.
[1266.88 → 1267.78] Your red cameras.
[1268.38 → 1269.38] The red dragon.
[1269.72 → 1271.46] The red epic while we're at it.
[1271.54 → 1272.50] The red weapon.
[1272.62 → 1274.48] Yeah, but then, like, at least they spelt it right.
[1275.56 → 1276.84] At least they spelt it right.
[1276.84 → 1277.50] Like, I feel like...
[1278.02 → 1282.12] But seriously, I feel like you'd be more positive about this if they put an there instead of a Y.
[1282.12 → 1284.18] Like, would you like it more if it was spelt right?
[1285.50 → 1285.98] You know what?
[1286.00 → 1288.64] Because a big part of your defence this whole time is that it's been silly.
[1288.86 → 1289.96] I'm going to be honest.
[1290.30 → 1291.98] No, I wouldn't like it better.
[1292.16 → 1292.48] Interesting.
[1292.58 → 1297.12] Now that they've gone down the path of Ry zen being R-Y...
[1298.90 → 1299.34] Okay.
[1299.76 → 1300.52] So every...
[1300.52 → 1301.94] The second letter just always has...
[1301.94 → 1302.92] Nope, that's not even the second one.
[1302.94 → 1303.60] The's.
[1304.46 → 1304.86] Okay.
[1305.30 → 1306.02] R-Y's.
[1306.44 → 1306.68] And, like...
[1306.68 → 1307.24] So lame.
[1308.00 → 1309.72] Well, yes.
[1309.90 → 1310.68] I hate that.
[1310.86 → 1312.10] But if you're going to do it, then...
[1312.10 → 1312.72] And be consistent.
[1312.92 → 1313.48] I got you.
[1313.52 → 1313.86] I got you.
[1313.88 → 1314.56] I just hate that.
[1315.14 → 1315.46] Okay.
[1315.56 → 1317.46] So, so far, most folks...
[1317.46 → 1317.64] Yeah.
[1318.16 → 1319.28] Are saying...
[1319.28 → 1319.80] I'm on the...
[1319.80 → 1322.76] And that makes sense, because I'm on the unprofessional to neutral side of things.
[1322.84 → 1324.40] I don't really care, but I would...
[1324.40 → 1325.92] A part of me would be like, ugh.
[1326.42 → 1329.12] Like, I might have to defend this to someone, because they're going to be like, why did you
[1329.12 → 1330.10] buy something called an Epic?
[1330.10 → 1332.08] Why are you buying Epic processors?
[1332.58 → 1332.68] Yeah.
[1332.82 → 1334.68] Like, we just need some infrastructure stuff.
[1334.74 → 1335.22] What are you doing?
[1335.30 → 1336.64] And I'd have to be like, ugh, okay.
[1336.92 → 1337.68] Like, look at the stuff.
[1337.68 → 1341.16] Epic is perfect, because it has a lot of threads, and it's cheaper, and it has a lot
[1341.16 → 1341.96] of memory bandwidth.
[1342.40 → 1346.04] And then, by then, their eyes glaze over, and hopefully they just sign off on PO.
[1346.22 → 1346.32] Yeah.
[1346.32 → 1346.42] Yeah.
[1346.42 → 1346.66] Yeah.
[1346.74 → 1348.08] It's like, okay, everything's fine.
[1348.12 → 1351.18] But, like, that was an unnecessary amount of communication that had to happen.
[1351.18 → 1352.10] Yeah.
[1352.10 → 1352.20] Yeah.
[1352.40 → 1355.98] And, you know, like, the stupid thing is, like, we're probably gonna...
[1355.98 → 1357.28] We're probably...
[1357.28 → 1362.68] We're probably gonna all, like, agree that it doesn't matter anymore in a number of years,
[1362.68 → 1363.18] but...
[1363.18 → 1370.86] Someone named Linus Rockin' Mandel's in the chat, um...
[1370.86 → 1375.92] I don't know what's going on there, but said, no, because Intel owns the letter for processors.
[1375.92 → 1379.62] And, like, obviously, like, they don't own it, but that's an interesting point.
[1379.70 → 1382.80] They might be trying to stay away from the in anything.
[1382.98 → 1385.18] There are lots of words that don't have eyes in them.
[1385.64 → 1385.84] Yeah.
[1385.90 → 1386.62] Like, blind.
[1390.38 → 1390.78] What?
[1392.30 → 1393.70] I'm genuinely confused.
[1396.80 → 1397.58] No eyes?
[1398.26 → 1398.62] Oh.
[1399.92 → 1400.28] Oh.
[1401.62 → 1402.06] Oh.
[1402.06 → 1405.48] You can have eyes and be blind, though.
[1405.48 → 1407.14] Twitch is booing so hard.
[1407.26 → 1408.20] It's just like, boo.
[1408.68 → 1412.28] But that doesn't even make sense, because you can be blind with eyes still.
[1412.40 → 1415.48] You don't have to, like, have your eyes have been removed to be blind.
[1415.92 → 1417.00] Oh, I'm terrible.
[1417.58 → 1419.86] I should just end it all now.
[1420.38 → 1421.38] Oh, my God.
[1421.56 → 1421.94] Okay.
[1422.16 → 1423.66] So, at any rate...
[1423.66 → 1424.62] That was brutal.
[1424.62 → 1427.72] Let's talk about the chip formerly known as Naples.
[1427.86 → 1429.12] Okay, I was right.
[1429.12 → 1432.66] 8-channel DDR4, 16-channel DDR4, what are these articles?
[1433.48 → 1434.28] So, single...
[1434.28 → 1434.96] No, that was for Epic.
[1435.76 → 1436.96] Now known as Epic.
[1437.40 → 1445.18] Single-socket processor scales up to 32 cores, and as far as I know, there will be dual-socket variants as well.
[1445.28 → 1446.06] Oh, that's fancy.
[1446.36 → 1447.56] Are we getting some?
[1447.80 → 1449.34] I am in touch.
[1449.98 → 1450.54] They want to know...
[1450.54 → 1450.80] In the board?
[1450.80 → 1452.80] So, basically, what...
[1452.80 → 1453.90] What...
[1453.90 → 1455.72] Oh, I don't know how much of this I can say.
[1457.56 → 1458.74] Okay, what I can say...
[1458.74 → 1460.88] I can talk generally about server hardware.
[1461.20 → 1467.92] Generally speaking, if someone's going to seed you server hardware, they're going to be like, what are you going to do with this?
[1468.48 → 1471.52] Because if my answer is, we're going to run into the bench.
[1472.82 → 1474.30] They're going to be like, cool.
[1474.64 → 1475.56] Go buy one, then.
[1475.56 → 1478.70] Um, so if we come up with...
[1478.70 → 1480.64] For me, I want to come up with a really cool project.
[1481.02 → 1490.46] So, I want a couple of 32-core Epics for a total of 64 cores, and I want to figure out something completely bananas that we can do with it.
[1490.88 → 1492.22] So, assuming that they've...
[1492.22 → 1495.28] What about speed transcoding YP9 8K footage?
[1497.00 → 1497.72] Sure, dog.
[1498.20 → 1499.34] Like, you...
[1499.34 → 1500.24] So, there's that.
[1500.44 → 1501.58] That would be really cool.
[1501.64 → 1502.68] I had another idea.
[1502.80 → 1503.42] That would be fun.
[1503.42 → 1505.74] Um, is that like something that you...
[1505.74 → 1506.28] So, does...
[1506.28 → 1507.78] That would be wonderful for 4K.
[1507.78 → 1510.66] ...scale with more CPU cores, basically infinitely?
[1510.90 → 1511.70] Uh, there's...
[1511.70 → 1514.24] We're still talking to Boiler about it.
[1514.32 → 1520.50] Boiler wants to do this thing, which completely makes sense, and I'm totally on board, but we can't do it right now, because we don't have the infrastructure right now.
[1520.62 → 1527.02] But it's like distributed transcoding, where you like, slice up the video and then transcode it in a bunch of different places, on a bunch of different servers, on a bunch of different cores.
[1527.04 → 1529.80] But if we had a 64-core machine, would that be unnecessary?
[1530.06 → 1531.36] Maybe do it in one place.
[1531.58 → 1531.86] Right.
[1531.86 → 1532.52] I don't know.
[1532.60 → 1533.18] It's still...
[1533.18 → 1534.02] I was talking to Boiler.
[1534.14 → 1535.90] Apparently, it's like 30 times harder.
[1536.72 → 1537.56] Yeah, because key frames...
[1537.56 → 1541.14] But then if you just have like a monstrous computer...
[1541.14 → 1541.86] Then...
[1541.86 → 1542.72] Maybe.
[1542.96 → 1543.12] YOLO.
[1543.30 → 1543.56] Yeah.
[1543.96 → 1544.28] Okay.
[1544.50 → 1546.14] Okay, so I'd be totally down for that.
[1546.20 → 1546.44] Okay.
[1546.54 → 1549.64] And then one of the ideas that I wanted to look at is...
[1549.64 → 1550.10] Boiler, talk to me.
[1550.10 → 1552.74] ...if they've got virtualization sorted out a little bit more.
[1552.78 → 1555.80] And to be specific, I'm talking about KVM.
[1555.80 → 1558.06] So Red Hat KVM, because that's what Unpaid uses.
[1558.52 → 1568.42] I think it would be amazing to get my hands on like a multi-GPU bare-bones server, much like what we did for 10 gamers, one CPU.
[1568.96 → 1571.06] Boiler's just like, yes!
[1571.06 → 1573.38] And get this.
[1573.74 → 1579.96] What I'm thinking is the entire editing den running off of one tower.
[1580.84 → 1582.34] Six editing...
[1582.34 → 1587.54] Six 10-core editing workstations off of a single tower.
[1588.00 → 1588.40] Nice.
[1588.40 → 1592.52] So that's kind of something that I have in mind for what I'd like to do with it.
[1592.56 → 1595.58] So I'm going to try and come up with some cool projects.
[1596.06 → 1597.78] But yeah.
[1598.00 → 1601.78] Basically, this thing is unbelievable.
[1602.00 → 1604.30] So 8-core memory up to 16 Simms per CPU.
[1607.06 → 1608.34] They've got...
[1608.34 → 1613.54] Epic provides up to 128 PCI Express 3.0 lanes.
[1613.86 → 1617.06] Allowing you to connect more GPUs directly to the CPU.
[1617.06 → 1620.88] And that's really important for machine learning type applications.
[1620.88 → 1626.10] We've got our unboxing of Sous, the fastest supercomputer in Canada.
[1626.36 → 1630.26] So I went down there, and they've got a ton of GPU nodes.
[1630.70 → 1637.02] And they would love to have the GPUs connected directly to the PCIe lanes on the CPU.
[1637.12 → 1639.06] In fact, we were talking about that for...
[1639.06 → 1643.66] It's in my notes, but I don't remember exactly what workload specifically it was.
[1643.66 → 1643.90] Okay.
[1643.90 → 1648.22] Where inter-GPU communication is incredibly important.
[1648.52 → 1650.98] And the more hubs that you have to pass through, the worse.
[1651.58 → 1652.82] And then I even talked to...
[1652.82 → 1655.48] It's so cool talking to these high-level architect guys.
[1655.56 → 1656.86] I'm like, okay, well, what about NV Link?
[1656.90 → 1660.84] And he's like, yeah, the cost just wasn't right for what we're doing.
[1660.96 → 1665.96] And it's all these kinds of trade-offs where normally as a consumer, you hear about this crap.
[1665.96 → 1673.82] And you've got NVIDIA on a stage with freaking wood screws and whatever it is that they're talking about going, this is the future of blah, blah, blah.
[1674.00 → 1678.50] But then, you know, to us, this is all totally unattainable stuff.
[1678.50 → 1695.62] Whereas you're talking about people who are working on data centres that are in the value of $10 to $20 million, where they're actually taking like a $2 million solution and a $3 million solution and evaluating it the same way that we would like two different laptops.
[1697.00 → 1697.44] Yeah.
[1697.44 → 1699.88] But they're just working on a different scale.
[1700.00 → 1701.62] It's all the same conversations.
[1701.82 → 1705.80] It's like, do I want to pay this much more for this much more performance increase?
[1705.90 → 1708.80] And they just, for their design, it didn't end up making sense.
[1709.12 → 1711.14] And it was going to add some cost.
[1711.18 → 1712.50] And I don't know the exact numbers.
[1712.58 → 1716.08] So there's no like NDA information that I could hope to give you.
[1716.14 → 1717.54] I just know that they didn't use it.
[1717.66 → 1721.72] And they opted for these, they opted for certain GPU nodes.
[1721.72 → 1730.32] Some of the GPU nodes for certain workloads are connected directly to the CPUs, and some of them are not, depending on what they're needed for.
[1730.38 → 1731.48] And these are higher cost.
[1731.56 → 1732.38] I was just like, oh, cool.
[1732.88 → 1733.76] That's pretty fancy.
[1733.78 → 1734.78] You guys are so baller.
[1734.80 → 1735.28] I love you.
[1736.86 → 1740.44] So Epic is expected to launch before the end of June.
[1740.48 → 1746.82] You can tell AMD is in full-on crisis mode about their stock dropping, what was it, two weeks ago?
[1747.38 → 1748.00] Oh, my goodness.
[1748.10 → 1749.38] We have so much stuff coming.
[1749.38 → 1750.44] We have stuff.
[1750.56 → 1751.62] Please just wait.
[1752.08 → 1754.24] We have so much stuff.
[1755.48 → 1758.30] Even Radeon Technologies Group was showing off stuff.
[1758.38 → 1761.94] So this was originally posted by PCGamer324 on the forum.
[1762.04 → 1767.36] The original article here is from, oh, three, did I say three?
[1767.58 → 1768.82] Okay, no, Digital Trends.
[1768.84 → 1769.26] Here we go.
[1769.96 → 1776.34] AMD's Radeon Vega Frontier Edition is the most powerful graphics card yet, according to AMD.
[1779.28 → 1780.56] All right.
[1780.56 → 1780.62] All right.
[1780.62 → 1787.20] So the numbers put forth by AMD are as follows.
[1787.20 → 1791.22] It'll have 64 next-generation compute units.
[1791.22 → 1799.90] So that's 13 teraflops of peak single precision 32-bit compute performance, which should put it in the neighbourhood of NVIDIA's top cards.
[1799.90 → 1801.48] I think their top card is 12.
[1801.48 → 1807.34] And that's a squadron P6000.
[1807.34 → 1812.28] Don't quote me on that, but I'm trying to look this up as quickly as I can.
[1814.42 → 1815.50] Squadron P6000.
[1815.60 → 1815.74] Yeah.
[1815.74 → 1822.04] 12 teraflops for their top-of-the-line squadron, which is about a $5,000 graphics card.
[1822.60 → 1823.92] What else do we know about it?
[1823.92 → 1828.24] I wasn't sure about all the stuff you said because I was checking in with something.
[1828.24 → 1834.68] 16 gigs of HBM2 memory, so that's pretty impressive on a super-wide 2048-bit bus.
[1834.68 → 1836.20] Have you shown them the shroud?
[1837.10 → 1839.52] The shroud looks freaking sick.
[1839.60 → 1839.88] Yeah.
[1841.24 → 1843.42] AMD finally gets it on the shroud.
[1843.52 → 1848.30] Although, if it's like plastic and kind of cheesy looking, then I really don't know if that's going to be that impressive.
[1848.46 → 1855.14] To be fair, the last one that came out that was plastic and cheesy looking, once it was in a case, it was actually a little hard to tell.
[1855.90 → 1856.20] Right.
[1856.20 → 1856.86] Okay, fair enough.
[1856.86 → 1859.62] It's still not amazing, but it wasn't that bad.
[1860.74 → 1877.60] So they're saying that Vega's memory architecture can access terabytes of memory, and we've actually seen them kind of move beyond the memory that's HBM2 or GDDR memory that is soldered to the board.
[1877.60 → 1887.32] And what was that professional card that was using SSDs, like it was using NAND in order to have – I forget how much memory it was on it.
[1887.66 → 1888.14] I don't remember.
[1888.14 → 1889.02] I'm sorry, you guys.
[1889.08 → 1895.36] I wish I had a more exact set of talking points for this, but they were showing it off at CES.
[1895.36 → 1905.58] And the idea was that they were using NAND flash in order to dramatically increase the amount of – basically the size of the project that you could work on,
[1905.64 → 1912.84] because it's still faster since you've got a nice lightning-fast interface than trying to go out to like a scratch disk or something.
[1913.04 → 1922.46] So apparently AMD is claiming that they've done several benchmarks with it, and the Vega Frontier Edition is apparently 70% faster in SolidWorks?
[1922.46 → 1924.46] Okay.
[1925.30 → 1927.06] Which is like pretty insane.
[1927.36 → 1935.32] Another program that I haven't personally heard of called Katya – I'm hoping I'm saying that correctly – it's 27% faster in.
[1936.28 → 1936.76] Okay.
[1937.04 → 1937.96] Which is pretty wild.
[1938.76 → 1942.38] I mean, AMD has been known from time to time.
[1944.86 → 1950.26] Sorry, I didn't mean to get an ice cube in my mouth, and now – okay, it's gone now.
[1950.28 → 1950.58] Very nice.
[1950.58 → 1954.52] So AMD has been known to cherry-pick benchmarks from time to time.
[1956.62 → 1959.16] But still, it's promising.
[1959.42 → 1962.64] And like that happened last time – you just reorganized it and control Z that.
[1963.28 → 1966.06] That happened last time with their CPUs to a certain degree.
[1966.24 → 1970.10] But then a big part of what they're claiming did end up being true.
[1970.14 → 1970.54] That's right.
[1970.54 → 1977.72] And what we do know, based on that it's not getting completely stomped on, is that we're going to have competition.
[1978.04 → 1978.24] Yeah.
[1978.38 → 1980.54] At least until NVIDIA trickles down Volta.
[1981.08 → 1982.36] And like – yeah, fair.
[1982.66 → 1987.56] But like with their CPU, what they were claiming did completely end up being true.
[1987.68 → 1987.84] Yeah.
[1987.84 → 1992.00] So if you're into SolidWorks, there's one really cool thing that just happened.
[1992.22 → 1992.38] Yeah.
[1992.46 → 1997.68] But again, it depends on how you're benchmarking that specifically, what kind of projects you're working on.
[1997.68 → 1997.70] That's fair.
[1997.70 → 1999.32] What you have in SolidWorks at that time.
[1999.48 → 2001.96] This is basically the AMD show at this point.
[2002.28 → 2003.28] Laptops are coming.
[2003.44 → 2005.02] Ry zen Mobile, Ry zen Pro.
[2005.18 → 2007.38] The original article is Trusted Reviews.
[2007.70 → 2009.00] Let's go ahead and pull that up.
[2009.06 → 2009.36] Don't worry.
[2009.44 → 2010.54] We'll get through this eventually.
[2010.76 → 2012.24] Ry zen finally comes to laptops.
[2012.78 → 2014.18] This I'm actually excited about.
[2014.24 → 2017.54] I would love to have like a 6 or an 8 core laptop.
[2018.12 → 2018.92] That would be awesome.
[2019.24 → 2021.44] I don't know if they're going to be able to get the power low enough.
[2021.44 → 2024.00] And I haven't actually looked that closely at this yet.
[2024.06 → 2027.24] But like 6 core laptop would be freaking awesome.
[2027.88 → 2032.44] AMD is claiming 50% more CPU performance than its previous 7th generation Apus.
[2033.42 → 2034.96] Lord, I would hope so.
[2035.14 → 2035.40] Yeah.
[2035.58 → 2036.22] And –
[2036.22 → 2040.92] A lot of these claims are a little whimsical, I think, because they're from kind of, you know, older stuff.
[2040.92 → 2044.82] So 40% better graphics performance and a 50% cut in power.
[2044.94 → 2047.04] But you're jumping quite a few categories there.
[2047.16 → 2051.40] Quite a few generations of improvement that Intel has been making.
[2051.72 → 2053.72] So they might not be leapfrogging Intel.
[2053.86 → 2057.22] But I guess the promise here is that they're going to be competitive.
[2057.78 → 2061.46] And then they also announced Ry zen Pro, a version designed for business PCs.
[2063.02 → 2063.46] Wow.
[2064.64 → 2065.20] So much AMD news.
[2065.20 → 2065.90] Which is actually kind of weird.
[2065.90 → 2068.20] Like, I get it, pro, professional.
[2068.38 → 2071.18] But for a long time, pro has been like a gaming thing.
[2071.34 → 2072.84] Yeah, like higher – just like higher performance.
[2072.96 → 2073.24] Yeah.
[2073.54 → 2073.78] Yeah.
[2073.78 → 2075.22] So that's actually a little bit weird.
[2078.26 → 2079.32] But, oh well.
[2079.72 → 2081.04] Like, I feel like Ry zen's smart.
[2081.62 → 2085.56] Or like even just Ry zen Business would have been cool.
[2085.56 → 2088.36] So come back up a little bit.
[2088.36 → 2091.60] So did it help them to kind of announce all this stuff?
[2092.02 → 2093.14] Kind of looks like it.
[2094.12 → 2101.26] I mean, they haven't quite recovered from – this was when they did their quarterly earnings report, right?
[2101.32 → 2101.50] Yeah.
[2101.50 → 2101.98] I believe so.
[2102.86 → 2103.42] Well, yeah.
[2103.42 → 2104.12] We'll see how that goes.
[2104.20 → 2106.00] I mean, I don't know what – here's the thing.
[2106.46 → 2111.00] I don't know what people were expecting from that quarterly earnings report.
[2111.00 → 2111.92] Like, if I invested –
[2111.92 → 2113.74] It was fairly accurate to what they guessed.
[2113.74 → 2113.86] Yeah.
[2114.06 → 2119.64] If I invested in tech companies, I would actually love to know what our viewers think.
[2119.72 → 2121.60] Like, should I be allowed to invest in tech companies?
[2121.70 → 2122.34] Because I'd love to.
[2122.34 → 2122.74] Are you?
[2123.20 → 2125.78] I'm allowed to, but I have to disclose it.
[2126.14 → 2126.54] Okay.
[2126.66 → 2126.82] Yeah.
[2127.28 → 2130.30] But like it's a matter of whether they will allow me to.
[2130.30 → 2146.04] But I would have probably bought some AMD right after that drop because it was – the drop was based on people having completely unrealistic – an unrealistic reaction to what AMD has been doing over the last quarter.
[2146.22 → 2152.12] It's like Ry zen 7 and even Ry zen 5 are the tip of the iceberg, you guys.
[2152.12 → 2158.20] Because that's like the enthusiast gamer chip and then the like slightly less enthusiast gamer chip.
[2158.30 → 2166.20] Where they're going to move volume is Ry zen 3 and where they're going to make margin and start to be profitable is going to be products like Thread ripper and Epic.
[2166.90 → 2168.38] So, yeah.
[2168.46 → 2171.38] I don't know what people were asking for there.
[2171.38 → 2183.36] Not only that, but, you know, any new product is going to take some time to ramp up in terms of yields, in terms of having stock on the shelves, in terms of the platform maturing a little bit.
[2183.42 → 2194.24] I mean, I don't know if you guys noticed, but you didn't hear from us run out and buy Ry zen in the first six weeks because it was promising.
[2194.24 → 2202.14] And we were confident that AMD and their partners like ASUS and Gigabyte and MSI, we were confident they were going to get all this stuff addressed.
[2203.06 → 2204.60] But it wasn't yet.
[2204.86 → 2209.70] And when you buy a computer, it needs to work on the day you buy it.
[2210.00 → 2215.66] So, I mean, a lot of people criticized us for doing a Core i5 build guide shortly after the launch of Ry zen.
[2215.66 → 2221.88] But the reality of it was when we were filming that, we weren't ready to say, go buy a Ry zen PC yet.
[2221.88 → 2225.38] Now, to be clear, it has improved a lot.
[2225.90 → 2226.90] Like, a lot.
[2227.02 → 2233.54] So, I am expecting over the next quarter or two these kinds of results to change in a big way.
[2234.92 → 2235.36] Sorry.
[2235.98 → 2236.92] Oh, no problem.
[2238.16 → 2240.02] Oh, they want me to do a straw poll.
[2240.38 → 2240.74] Okay.
[2241.02 → 2241.54] You know what?
[2241.84 → 2243.42] I'm going to do a straw poll.
[2243.42 → 2243.56] For what?
[2243.56 → 2246.50] Whether I should be allowed to invest in tech companies.
[2246.62 → 2246.74] Oh.
[2249.36 → 2251.42] See, like...
[2251.42 → 2252.46] Yeah.
[2252.66 → 2253.16] I don't know.
[2253.42 → 2254.32] I don't know.
[2254.76 → 2256.70] So, to be clear, I actually...
[2256.70 → 2260.24] Oh, this is something I've been meaning to talk about on WAN Show for quite some time.
[2261.06 → 2267.32] We are working on, like, a private deal with a much, much smaller tech company.
[2267.42 → 2270.00] So, maybe I'll talk about it after our ad break.
[2271.28 → 2271.80] But...
[2271.80 → 2274.52] What is actually bad about that?
[2274.90 → 2277.50] Well, it creates a potential conflict of interest.
[2277.50 → 2278.50] Like, if I...
[2278.50 → 2279.10] Oh, yeah.
[2279.20 → 2280.36] Then, yeah.
[2280.48 → 2282.66] If I own a bunch of NVIDIA stock, then...
[2282.66 → 2283.48] As a viewer...
[2283.48 → 2287.14] Because I thought we were looking at the like, insider trading side of things.
[2287.20 → 2289.18] No, I don't think that's an issue.
[2289.18 → 2294.06] Because I can just not buy when I know anything.
[2294.46 → 2294.82] Right.
[2294.82 → 2296.06] And that's pretty easy to do.
[2296.14 → 2300.96] Because I think, you know, if you were to just go, okay, the embargo's up.
[2301.54 → 2305.78] Three minutes later, now that everyone knows all the same things I know, go buy.
[2305.90 → 2306.20] Go buy.
[2306.20 → 2310.00] I mean, you could kind of beat the rush on that kind of thing if you wanted to.
[2310.12 → 2310.84] Is it an advantage?
[2311.08 → 2311.36] Yes.
[2311.48 → 2313.22] But is it against the law?
[2313.28 → 2315.66] As far as my understanding goes, no, it wouldn't be.
[2316.06 → 2316.28] Right.
[2316.46 → 2318.30] So, as a viewer, I would say no.
[2318.52 → 2319.22] You would say no.
[2319.32 → 2320.30] Everyone else says yes.
[2320.40 → 2321.42] Go ahead and cast your vote.
[2323.32 → 2323.84] Because...
[2323.84 → 2329.08] So, for me, where I've kind of drawn the line already, because, like I said, we are working
[2329.08 → 2332.70] on an investment deal with a really, tiny company.
[2332.70 → 2342.28] So, where I kind of draw the line is that if it's stuff that we cover, like the competitors
[2342.28 → 2342.68] of.
[2342.76 → 2347.78] Like, if it's stuff where it's kind of one option or the other, and where I'm in a position
[2347.78 → 2352.40] to inflate the appearance of, let's say, Intel versus AMD.
[2352.40 → 2359.08] So, would you be declaring in every single video that you cover this one mono company on?
[2359.16 → 2362.26] I'm saying mono because you're not covering other ones in its space.
[2362.26 → 2363.82] That you have ownership.
[2364.28 → 2364.78] No, I think...
[2364.78 → 2367.88] Because to a certain degree, that makes every single video an ad.
[2368.08 → 2368.28] Yeah.
[2368.34 → 2374.98] I think the disclosure regulations are such that you talk about it only in the context
[2374.98 → 2377.34] of talking about that company.
[2377.92 → 2380.76] So, let's say I owned a bunch of shares of Intel.
[2380.84 → 2386.16] If we are going to talk about an Intel news story, I need to have a thing up that says,
[2386.48 → 2390.34] disclaimer, I am long Intel.
[2390.34 → 2391.68] Or something like that.
[2391.74 → 2393.66] Like, you have to clarify your position.
[2394.00 → 2395.22] You say, I am long Intel?
[2395.32 → 2396.18] Yeah, long Intel.
[2396.54 → 2400.86] So, I have a long-term investment in Intel.
[2401.08 → 2405.02] Whereas, you would say I'm short Intel, if you think Intel's going to have a big quarter
[2405.02 → 2409.44] and you want to kind of put in some money, grab it, back out.
[2409.90 → 2410.10] Yeah.
[2410.20 → 2411.04] So, long or short.
[2411.18 → 2411.36] Yeah.
[2411.36 → 2414.06] And I think medium, but I'm not sure.
[2414.14 → 2415.46] Like, I'm not an expert on this stuff.
[2415.52 → 2417.64] I've only actually bought stock, like, twice.
[2419.72 → 2421.04] So, there you have it.
[2421.80 → 2423.64] We should probably go through our sponsors for the show.
[2423.72 → 2426.84] Speaking of, you know, disclosures.
[2427.12 → 2428.38] I guess that's not really a disclosure.
[2429.06 → 2429.50] FreshBooks!
[2430.18 → 2430.62] Hooray!
[2431.20 → 2434.98] So, if you guys are running a small business, let's say you are...
[2434.98 → 2437.40] Come up with a small business we've never talked about before.
[2437.52 → 2437.80] Come on.
[2437.84 → 2439.68] Trying to distribute videos on the internet.
[2439.84 → 2441.30] No, not like that.
[2441.42 → 2442.16] That's not...
[2442.16 → 2442.62] That's not...
[2442.62 → 2443.62] Trying to...
[2443.62 → 2444.62] Uh...
[2444.62 → 2445.62] Uh...
[2446.44 → 2447.62] Terrible.
[2447.62 → 2448.56] Detail cars.
[2448.96 → 2449.38] Yes!
[2449.74 → 2450.14] Okay!
[2450.46 → 2454.20] So, if you have a small, like, shop out of your garage where you work on cars...
[2454.20 → 2456.58] Or even a mobile one, because you can accept payments through your phone.
[2456.68 → 2458.64] Or let's say you're a locksmith.
[2459.02 → 2459.22] Yeah.
[2459.22 → 2459.36] Okay?
[2459.46 → 2460.46] So, you've got a...
[2460.46 → 2463.54] And then we'll go with, you know, the usual one that's more likely in our audience.
[2463.64 → 2465.64] Let's say you do small-time tech repair.
[2466.08 → 2470.90] If you run a small business, FreshBooks is the way for you to take your accounting solution
[2470.90 → 2472.14] with you on the go.
[2472.46 → 2476.24] It's got all the same functionality in the mobile app that it does in the desktop version.
[2476.24 → 2483.10] And keep track of everything from expenses to hours worked on a given job to your invoicing.
[2483.10 → 2486.88] You can send professional-looking invoices in a matter of minutes.
[2487.26 → 2491.88] And you can accept payment through the FreshBooks platform on your own terms.
[2491.96 → 2494.24] So, you can take deposits and then take the rest later.
[2494.42 → 2496.32] Or you can take everything after the fact.
[2496.38 → 2499.42] And you can even see when your client has seen the invoice.
[2499.62 → 2501.10] So, you know that...
[2501.82 → 2503.38] Well, so you know that they saw it.
[2503.92 → 2505.78] So, if this sounds pretty good...
[2505.78 → 2506.16] Actually...
[2506.16 → 2507.10] Oh, and I forgot, right?
[2507.16 → 2507.78] They've got...
[2507.78 → 2509.58] They've got free tech support.
[2509.58 → 2512.54] When you call FreshBooks, you talk directly to a human being.
[2512.68 → 2515.20] And they walk you through what you're having trouble with.
[2515.30 → 2519.58] No robot portals, which are insanely frustrating.
[2519.72 → 2520.66] I had to deal with one.
[2521.08 → 2522.94] I'm not going to mention who, but it was really brutal.
[2523.10 → 2524.02] It took a long time.
[2524.06 → 2524.76] It was really annoying.
[2524.84 → 2525.96] I had to call my credit card.
[2526.08 → 2528.78] And I ended up, like, five or six tiers in.
[2529.52 → 2530.26] We're sorry.
[2530.74 → 2531.68] We're now closed.
[2532.64 → 2535.96] So, basically, you just wasted, like, nine minutes of my time.
[2536.10 → 2537.06] Oh, that's brutal.
[2537.06 → 2540.24] And I can't even talk to anybody about why this transaction didn't go through.
[2540.70 → 2541.06] Perfect.
[2541.74 → 2542.38] Thank you.
[2543.38 → 2545.14] Anyway, not with FreshBooks.
[2545.46 → 2549.22] So, head over to freshbooks.com slash WEN, and you can try it out for free.
[2549.36 → 2550.40] Tool around with the software.
[2550.92 → 2552.50] It's super easy to use.
[2552.66 → 2554.86] And see if it's right for you.
[2555.18 → 2559.22] When you are done deciding it's right for you, go to freshbooks.com slash tech tips.
[2559.32 → 2559.48] Wait.
[2561.26 → 2562.70] Okay, well, I guess it doesn't really matter.
[2563.04 → 2565.76] And enter the WEN show in the How Do You Hear About Us section.
[2565.76 → 2567.70] All right.
[2567.82 → 2568.76] Ah, yes.
[2571.24 → 2572.12] Oh, nice.
[2572.34 → 2573.96] It's savage jerky time.
[2574.62 → 2575.02] Yay.
[2575.16 → 2576.20] I get Reaper again?
[2576.70 → 2578.06] Well, you don't have to eat Reaper.
[2578.22 → 2582.28] You could have the ghost pepper buffalo sauce.
[2582.40 → 2584.20] I'm going to do ghost pepper buffalo sauce today.
[2584.32 → 2584.90] Yeah, I'm doing it.
[2584.90 → 2585.60] Which one's hotter?
[2585.64 → 2586.06] I don't remember.
[2586.88 → 2587.98] Is that six or five?
[2587.98 → 2588.20] Take that one.
[2588.68 → 2589.08] No.
[2589.26 → 2589.72] Take that one.
[2589.76 → 2590.84] No, I'm not taking the Reaper.
[2590.84 → 2591.92] I don't want to do the Reaper.
[2591.92 → 2592.90] This one's your favourite one, right?
[2592.90 → 2594.24] No, no.
[2594.46 → 2595.86] All of my...
[2595.86 → 2596.86] The maple bacon one.
[2596.86 → 2597.72] The maple bacon one.
[2597.72 → 2598.28] Ah, maple bacon.
[2598.34 → 2599.52] Yeah, the maple bacon one.
[2599.62 → 2601.06] I just ate it all after the show.
[2602.92 → 2605.18] I really like the Mojo Habanero.
[2605.34 → 2606.14] That's my favourite one.
[2606.72 → 2606.92] Yeah.
[2607.06 → 2607.98] Good amount of spice.
[2608.32 → 2612.32] You can tell it's like the second or third savage jerky spot.
[2612.48 → 2616.80] When it's like the stuff that we absolutely cannot resist.
[2617.10 → 2618.62] It's just all gone.
[2618.62 → 2620.04] Okay.
[2620.46 → 2622.54] Well, this is my favourite one, but he hid it from me.
[2624.08 → 2625.56] So I couldn't have any more of it.
[2627.38 → 2627.60] Mmm.
[2631.74 → 2632.70] Are you good so far?
[2632.78 → 2633.72] You had the ghost pepper.
[2636.50 → 2638.12] So you didn't have quite the hottest one.
[2638.50 → 2639.84] This one's actually still sealed.
[2639.84 → 2647.86] The ghost pepper and buffalo sauce is hot enough for me.
[2649.30 → 2649.90] But basically...
[2649.90 → 2650.60] Jake, you want some ghost pepper?
[2651.18 → 2653.00] Jake does perfect with spice.
[2653.26 → 2654.54] I would probably throw up.
[2654.54 → 2657.46] He's very spice tolerant.
[2657.92 → 2658.32] All right.
[2658.38 → 2659.26] So savage jerky.
[2659.68 → 2659.88] Woo!
[2660.82 → 2661.02] Woo!
[2661.58 → 2663.08] See, that one...
[2663.08 → 2663.76] Where'd it go?
[2663.84 → 2665.40] Mojo Habanero gives you a bit of a kick.
[2666.26 → 2667.36] But it's not like...
[2667.36 → 2668.94] It's not doing that to me.
[2669.34 → 2670.14] Like, I feel good.
[2670.28 → 2671.26] It woke me up a little bit.
[2671.38 → 2672.36] It's definitely spicy.
[2672.56 → 2673.26] It definitely hits you.
[2673.32 → 2675.40] My mouth is burning, but it's like...
[2675.40 → 2676.04] Yeah.
[2676.32 → 2677.30] An okay amount of burning.
[2677.98 → 2680.20] I'm not having uncontrollable hiccups.
[2680.92 → 2682.56] I get hiccups when stuff's spicy.
[2683.26 → 2684.32] So you can buy a mix.
[2684.66 → 2686.98] You can get like cracked pepper and sea salt.
[2687.24 → 2687.46] Yeah.
[2687.52 → 2688.38] And a few other ones.
[2688.38 → 2691.42] And like find your sweet spot like I did with Mojo Habanero.
[2691.42 → 2693.24] Now to be clear, all of it...
[2693.24 → 2694.88] All of it is good.
[2695.18 → 2695.40] Yes.
[2695.42 → 2697.08] It's just what you can handle.
[2697.32 → 2697.52] Yeah.
[2697.94 → 2702.76] So savage jerky is made with the best ingredients without nitrates or preservatives.
[2703.52 → 2708.06] And the goal was to create a snack that's full of flavour and spice that isn't bad for you.
[2708.74 → 2715.12] The inspiration came from the flavour of garlic, lime, and cilantro as it brings out the natural flavour in premium beef.
[2715.96 → 2718.54] And this is in my notes.
[2718.54 → 2723.06] People seem to love the sriracha bacon, maple buffalo bacon, and the traditional flavours.
[2723.18 → 2724.32] They also make barbecue sauce.
[2724.76 → 2724.94] Wow.
[2725.00 → 2726.34] I had no idea.
[2727.54 → 2728.14] That's cool.
[2728.64 → 2733.54] So use offer code LTT to save 10% over at savagejerky.com.
[2734.18 → 2739.72] The cracked pepper and sea salt is like a perfect but more traditional styled beef jerky.
[2740.04 → 2740.22] Yeah.
[2740.22 → 2743.76] The problem with that one is that you can rip through a whole packet in like two minutes.
[2743.76 → 2744.06] Yeah.
[2745.48 → 2746.10] So yeah.
[2746.22 → 2751.78] If you want to like to troll your friends and get a ghost pepper, a reaper, something like that, it works.
[2752.54 → 2753.86] Or you might just like it.
[2754.80 → 2757.70] After the first bite, it's actually easier.
[2757.84 → 2758.66] It gets a little bit easier.
[2758.96 → 2758.98] Yeah.
[2759.02 → 2759.64] It does get easier.
[2760.94 → 2761.48] All right.
[2763.48 → 2765.64] It's also when you stop though.
[2765.64 → 2771.00] Because it gets easier after the first bite and then for a while, but then when you stop eating it, it hits you again.
[2771.00 → 2771.02] Oh yeah.
[2771.02 → 2772.18] No, then it hits you again.
[2772.76 → 2773.82] So LTX.
[2775.26 → 2778.72] LTX is the tech carnival that we're doing in the summer.
[2779.32 → 2782.64] We're going to have booths, games, prizes, and us.
[2782.80 → 2784.40] The whole LMG team will be there.
[2785.28 → 2788.24] A few examples of the kinds of booths that we're going to have.
[2788.32 → 2790.32] Like we wanted you to be just kind of goofy.
[2790.78 → 2793.54] So it's going to be stuff like guess how many CPUs are in the jar.
[2793.54 → 2796.98] Video editing with Taryn.
[2797.54 → 2797.74] Yeah.
[2798.34 → 2800.20] Like the Jellybean thing, but like CPUs.
[2800.26 → 2801.98] I think Free Geek's probably going to be in for that.
[2801.98 → 2802.66] Okay, yeah.
[2802.68 → 2804.96] So they'll be there with like, you know, just some.
[2805.00 → 2805.92] Oh, Free Geek's going to be there.
[2806.00 → 2806.74] Maybe, maybe.
[2806.88 → 2807.12] Okay.
[2807.20 → 2810.80] TBD, but like we're in talks with actually a lot of pretty cool folks.
[2811.12 → 2811.32] Okay.
[2811.80 → 2813.80] One other example would be the case toss.
[2814.16 → 2817.12] So we're going to get a case manufacturer to give us some cases.
[2817.12 → 2818.18] Is that nailed down now?
[2818.78 → 2821.06] Not exactly who, but someone's going to do it.
[2821.10 → 2821.74] Okay, okay.
[2821.80 → 2823.26] Because I'm pretty excited about that.
[2823.26 → 2826.26] And I know there are a few people that are pretty excited about that.
[2826.28 → 2828.14] We're going to do like a VR with Luke demo.
[2828.34 → 2830.74] So basically you'll be like kind of showing people the internet to VR.
[2830.74 → 2831.62] Oh, that's exciting.
[2832.40 → 2833.04] That's cool.
[2833.14 → 2834.94] I've been wondering this whole time what I was going to do.
[2835.16 → 2835.32] Yeah.
[2835.36 → 2835.96] That's really cool.
[2835.96 → 2839.72] And then Taryn's probably going to be doing like, he'll have an LTT video.
[2840.72 → 2843.14] And he'll just be working on it the whole time.
[2843.18 → 2844.86] So you can actually watch Taryn edit.
[2844.94 → 2845.72] You can ask him questions.
[2846.16 → 2847.14] That's been a great idea.
[2847.14 → 2849.38] We're not expecting him to actually get anything done.
[2849.38 → 2851.48] Because people will be like, blah, blah, blah.
[2851.60 → 2854.78] But like if people want to see how it's done in person, I thought that would be really cool.
[2854.84 → 2857.24] We're just going to like to pick up his workstation and take it there.
[2857.42 → 2859.32] So we've got a lot of really cool ideas.
[2859.62 → 2863.02] There's at least a few hundred people coming so far.
[2863.02 → 2868.18] So it's not going to necessarily be like over a thousand people and crazy.
[2868.30 → 2870.34] But that may actually be a blessing in disguise.
[2870.78 → 2876.60] Because at least that way we're going to be covering with like a significant title sponsor.
[2876.86 → 2880.00] We should be able to cover most of the cost of the venue already.
[2880.92 → 2884.84] And it'll actually, it could end up being a pretty intimate event.
[2884.90 → 2887.46] Although now that I say that, if everyone's like, oh yeah, I want to go to an infinite event.
[2888.74 → 2889.90] So no guarantees.
[2889.96 → 2891.72] How many people are going on your limo ride?
[2891.72 → 2893.32] I think that sold out.
[2893.66 → 2893.86] Whoa.
[2894.06 → 2894.24] Ten.
[2894.48 → 2894.70] Yeah.
[2896.10 → 2896.54] Cool.
[2896.68 → 2899.08] So that happened faster than I expected.
[2899.94 → 2903.70] I thought when I first read that, that by the limo they meant the Civic.
[2904.58 → 2904.94] No, no.
[2905.02 → 2906.44] I was like, oh, that's too many people.
[2906.74 → 2906.94] Yeah.
[2907.62 → 2907.86] Yeah.
[2908.92 → 2911.86] Ten people in my Civic would be like pretty intimate.
[2913.94 → 2914.80] As that goes.
[2916.78 → 2917.38] All right.
[2918.38 → 2919.56] I want to talk about this.
[2919.56 → 2925.24] Wanna Cry collects basically no ransom.
[2927.64 → 2931.68] Despite infecting 200,000 machines.
[2932.20 → 2935.64] So the deadline is beginning to pass here.
[2935.72 → 2937.18] The original article is from Bloomberg.
[2937.82 → 2938.60] I have a theory.
[2938.60 → 2944.30] And apparently the attackers have claimed only about $92,000 in payments.
[2945.30 → 2945.66] Huh.
[2945.96 → 2946.76] How about that?
[2947.80 → 2948.26] Hit me.
[2948.26 → 2954.28] So my theory is if this happened like a number of years ago, like when I was still in high
[2954.28 → 2956.70] school, I think it would have actually been a lot more impactful.
[2956.70 → 2963.96] Because now I think if people like have a baby now or get engaged now, all their photos go
[2963.96 → 2964.64] up on social media.
[2965.64 → 2967.82] So it's not their one backup that's on their computer.
[2967.82 → 2979.40] And I think what they ran into here was if people had super important stuff, the $300 was not good, but probably not the end of the world.
[2979.40 → 2985.20] And then other people are like, oh, well, this is a fairly major inconvenience, but I can go
[2985.20 → 2987.34] get my computer reformatted and everything's fine.
[2987.94 → 2989.72] Because everything I do is in a browser.
[2990.10 → 2991.28] Notice how they're releasing computers.
[2991.38 → 2993.20] They're like almost just browsers these days.
[2993.36 → 2993.38] Right.
[2993.38 → 2993.58] Yeah.
[2993.58 → 2996.88] So like for a lot of people, it's like, oh, what the heck is this?
[2996.92 → 2998.98] They show it to some techie friend, or they bring it to Geek Squad.
[2999.36 → 3003.30] They're just like, oh, yeah, we can do it cheaper than that ransom price anyway, but we have to do some stuff.
[3003.82 → 3006.88] And then people that are like, oh, my goodness, this is mission-critical information.
[3007.40 → 3013.24] $300 for like a big business sucks, but like not the end of the world.
[3013.86 → 3021.56] So if even 1% of people had paid the ransom, it would have worked out to over six times the amount they actually collected.
[3021.56 → 3025.00] So I feel like almost no Joe School has actually paid for it.
[3025.50 → 3030.34] And it gets worse because of the attention on this particular case.
[3031.08 → 3039.42] The authorities think it's unlikely the monies the attackers have received will be transferred from Bitcoin to more traditional currencies due to the risk of it being detected.
[3039.78 → 3044.56] With that said, there's a lot of stuff you can buy with Bitcoin, so I don't think that's as big a problem as some people might.
[3044.86 → 3048.42] Yeah, but they could still track that to a certain degree.
[3049.68 → 3050.08] Right.
[3050.14 → 3050.72] I guess that's true.
[3050.72 → 3051.84] Like that money is sketch.
[3051.98 → 3054.20] Depending on, but, but, okay, but they might.
[3054.20 → 3055.06] There are things they can do for sure.
[3055.06 → 3059.64] They might buy very illegitimate things, scatter it around, and then.
[3059.78 → 3059.90] Yeah.
[3060.90 → 3061.22] What up?
[3061.46 → 3065.14] Very easy to like, mix the Bitcoin.
[3065.28 → 3065.52] Yeah.
[3065.72 → 3066.78] No, it should be fine.
[3068.66 → 3069.36] Oh, really?
[3069.48 → 3072.90] Apparently people sell like mixing it up and obscuring it as a service.
[3073.18 → 3073.72] That's cool.
[3073.86 → 3074.80] I don't know enough about Bitcoin.
[3074.86 → 3075.52] Why do you know this?
[3075.60 → 3075.96] Go away.
[3075.96 → 3082.32] Jake is secretly running Silk Road 3 right now out of his house.
[3082.80 → 3083.74] He told me this offline.
[3085.18 → 3085.62] Great.
[3086.02 → 3086.24] Yeah.
[3087.36 → 3087.80] Yeah.
[3087.80 → 3090.62] Jake, can I have a favour?
[3091.14 → 3091.38] Yeah.
[3091.58 → 3092.76] Can I have more water, please?
[3093.28 → 3094.02] Oh my God.
[3094.18 → 3094.72] Yeah, Darren.
[3095.06 → 3098.30] You have to pay him in Bitcoin through his secret onion website.
[3098.52 → 3098.64] Thank you.
[3098.72 → 3099.22] I'm dying.
[3100.64 → 3101.20] Thank you.
[3101.28 → 3101.88] And ice too.
[3102.14 → 3102.38] Oh.
[3102.38 → 3103.62] Thank you.
[3104.76 → 3106.12] Ice is a different transaction.
[3106.12 → 3106.60] If you say thank you lots, then it's okay.
[3107.34 → 3108.58] Is that how that works?
[3109.36 → 3109.62] Yeah.
[3110.32 → 3113.76] I like to have like mucus all built up in my throat and stuff.
[3113.76 → 3114.52] I can hear the...
[3114.52 → 3116.28] Oh, your throat's even red here.
[3116.92 → 3118.00] Well, that's probably for me.
[3118.10 → 3119.62] I always have a red neck.
[3119.72 → 3119.96] Okay.
[3120.64 → 3121.80] Yeah, I was born in the sticks.
[3123.38 → 3123.66] Oh.
[3124.36 → 3124.62] Whew.
[3125.04 → 3125.24] Okay.
[3125.24 → 3126.02] You don't say you need milk?
[3126.10 → 3127.16] I don't think we just have milk.
[3127.36 → 3128.56] Yeah, we don't, unfortunately.
[3128.74 → 3130.96] And yes, I know milk works a lot better than water.
[3130.96 → 3137.80] Um, so this was originally posted on the forum by WMGroomAK, and the original article is from the tech report.
[3139.66 → 3144.48] Octane Simms and companion CPUs will arrive in 2018.
[3145.00 → 3154.34] So if you haven't been paying attention to this, Octane Simms are going to be super high capacity modules that will fit in...
[3154.34 → 3154.96] I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
[3154.96 → 3155.28] I'm kidding.
[3155.38 → 3155.72] It's fine.
[3155.72 → 3161.16] Much better.
[3162.26 → 3168.40] Super high capacity modules that will fit in otherwise normal RAM slots, as far as I know.
[3168.48 → 3176.36] Then there will be a like a special BIOS configuration that allows you to use it as a slower kind of, uh...
[3176.36 → 3179.96] So if you've got your level 1 cache, and your level 2 cache, your level 3 cache...
[3179.96 → 3183.20] I guess in some cases there's level 4, but don't worry about it...
[3183.20 → 3185.26] Then your next tier is DRAM.
[3185.70 → 3188.30] And then traditionally, your next tier was NAND.
[3188.46 → 3190.90] But it's like many orders of magnitude slower.
[3191.34 → 3193.20] So Octane sits in between.
[3193.20 → 3194.20] And, uh...
[3194.20 → 3202.54] What this will allow you to do is have massive, effective memory capacity for your system...
[3202.54 → 3206.10] Without needing so many DIMM slots.
[3206.10 → 3208.64] And without spending so much.
[3208.88 → 3211.68] So when we were checking out SFU's supercomputer...
[3211.68 → 3214.68] One of the things that they told us was that...
[3214.68 → 3216.82] Oh.
[3217.26 → 3217.54] Okay.
[3219.28 → 3219.58] Whew.
[3220.22 → 3221.68] Their, uh...
[3221.68 → 3225.50] Their systems that needed 1.5 terabytes, uh...
[3225.50 → 3225.94] Excuse me.
[3225.98 → 3226.14] Yeah.
[3226.48 → 3226.62] Wait.
[3226.98 → 3227.28] Yeah.
[3227.36 → 3230.00] 1.5 terabytes of memory had to be 2U.
[3230.26 → 3232.16] Just so they could fit all those RAM slots.
[3233.72 → 3234.20] Then...
[3234.20 → 3238.76] The systems that were going to be used for workloads that needed even more memory than that.
[3238.76 → 3241.76] The 3 terabyte memory systems, of which I think they only have 4...
[3242.40 → 3245.74] Had to be 4U systems with quad sockets.
[3245.96 → 3246.68] But get this.
[3247.58 → 3250.68] The quad socket CPUs they were using were 8 cores.
[3251.16 → 3255.76] So their quad socket systems actually had the same number of cores...
[3256.36 → 3259.06] As their dual 16 core socket systems.
[3260.04 → 3262.18] Or their dual socket 16 core systems.
[3262.42 → 3263.48] So 32, uh...
[3263.48 → 3263.60] Yeah.
[3263.66 → 3264.30] 32 total.
[3265.00 → 3265.78] And so...
[3265.78 → 3267.54] Because the only reason they needed it...
[3267.54 → 3269.00] Well, so they could have more RAM.
[3269.32 → 3271.02] So this could solve that problem.
[3271.02 → 3273.02] As long as the workloads that they're using...
[3274.10 → 3274.90] Can...
[3274.90 → 3276.02] Are okay...
[3276.02 → 3278.24] With the data being a little bit slower.
[3278.40 → 3281.90] But not as slow as trying to put it on NAND Flash.
[3282.02 → 3283.16] Someone just asked me what I'm eating.
[3283.26 → 3284.78] We literally just did a sponsor spot.
[3285.00 → 3286.10] It's savage jerky.
[3286.20 → 3287.56] I'm just still eating their stuff.
[3288.18 → 3291.70] Another cool thing is that they're saying that it's supposed to be cheaper.
[3292.14 → 3293.32] Lower prices than DRAM.
[3293.32 → 3294.22] Yes.
[3294.34 → 3295.76] Much cheaper than DRAM.
[3295.80 → 3300.46] Which, like, usually happens with new technologies over time.
[3300.66 → 3304.24] It's not super common for that to happen with a new technology right out of the gate.
[3304.52 → 3304.62] Yeah.
[3304.62 → 3305.24] So that's pretty cool.
[3305.30 → 3306.92] But it's intended to be...
[3306.92 → 3307.04] Yeah.
[3307.04 → 3312.48] Because it's designed to be an order of magnitude bigger than DRAM.
[3312.86 → 3314.32] But also a lot cheaper.
[3314.42 → 3316.22] To sit right in between NAND and DRAM.
[3316.38 → 3317.18] Which is super cool.
[3317.50 → 3317.52] I'm actually...
[3317.52 → 3319.80] I'm super excited to see where this takes us in the future.
[3320.30 → 3323.66] Oh, I realize I should probably talk about the deal that we are working on.
[3323.66 → 3333.10] So we've been working with Lime Tech, makers of Unpaid, for a year and a half now, I think.
[3333.24 → 3334.66] Going all the way back to...
[3334.66 → 3334.86] Oh, no.
[3334.94 → 3337.42] Because 7Gamers1CPU was a year and a half ago.
[3337.68 → 3337.88] Yeah.
[3338.04 → 3341.04] So it would have been closer to two years now, I guess.
[3341.14 → 3341.44] Wow.
[3341.54 → 3341.80] Really?
[3341.80 → 3342.80] Anyway.
[3342.92 → 3343.36] Anyway.
[3343.52 → 3345.42] So we've worked with them on a number of projects.
[3345.58 → 3346.50] We use their software.
[3347.02 → 3354.92] And I like it so much that basically what we're working on is an agreement where I would actually
[3354.92 → 3358.30] take a stake in the company and I would be working with them on future development.
[3359.44 → 3363.86] We've seen it in action in terms of where it's at today.
[3364.10 → 3369.00] But I think that there's a lot of stuff that we could help with that would make it so that
[3369.00 → 3370.62] they could really take things to the next level.
[3370.62 → 3373.80] So basically, that's where I'm at on that.
[3374.02 → 3375.20] Nothing is finalized.
[3375.28 → 3378.74] So I can't really give any more detail than that.
[3378.80 → 3382.76] But I just thought in the interest of you guys understanding sort of what we're up to
[3382.76 → 3384.92] over here, I want to make sure that that's clear.
[3385.40 → 3390.08] The reason that I was comfortable with Lime Tech, even though I have specifically gone out of
[3390.08 → 3394.90] my way to not buy shares in companies like AMD and Intel, is that we don't really cover
[3394.90 → 3395.54] their competitors.
[3395.54 → 3398.70] I mean, not just in the last two years.
[3399.36 → 3405.68] But even you go back a couple of years before that, we basically don't touch NAS systems.
[3406.58 → 3411.72] And the reason for that is because we just don't really like most of them.
[3411.82 → 3413.82] We don't think they're user-friendly.
[3414.10 → 3415.70] We don't think they're that easy to use.
[3416.22 → 3417.38] Which is the same thing.
[3417.50 → 3417.82] We tried.
[3417.82 → 3419.30] That's the main reason that I don't like them.
[3419.40 → 3419.84] I tried.
[3421.94 → 3424.92] And quite frankly, viewer interest is not that high.
[3425.46 → 3429.42] And a lot of the stuff that we've done with Unpaid has really been more about the other
[3429.42 → 3430.80] functionality that it has.
[3431.04 → 3433.56] So like the virtualization and stuff like that.
[3433.72 → 3436.78] So yeah, that's basically where I'm at on that.
[3436.78 → 3445.54] So what else do we got?
[3445.62 → 3447.42] I mean, we got actually a lot of topics this week.
[3447.42 → 3447.64] Deezer?
[3447.74 → 3448.18] Scrapheap Wars?
[3449.16 → 3450.28] Yeah, I'm down.
[3450.50 → 3451.94] How are we going to do that again?
[3452.24 → 3453.16] Jump to a random part.
[3453.84 → 3454.28] Hmm.
[3455.32 → 3455.76] Okay.
[3456.00 → 3459.68] So I don't know how to do...
[3459.68 → 3460.34] Oh, you know what?
[3460.34 → 3463.12] I never figured out the audio input.
[3464.10 → 3467.14] So that's a thing that I didn't do.
[3468.56 → 3469.42] Let's go ahead and pull up.
[3469.42 → 3470.34] How did we do it last time?
[3471.18 → 3474.54] I held up the laptop to the microphone, which was terrible.
[3476.96 → 3477.52] So...
[3478.20 → 3479.66] That might be the only way to do this.
[3480.34 → 3482.76] Well, it's not the only way, but it's the only way that I can do...
[3482.76 → 3484.30] Why can't you listen to it over HDMI?
[3484.56 → 3486.98] Right now, because I don't know either.
[3487.58 → 3489.64] These don't take audio.
[3490.34 → 3491.44] Go ahead and click on it.
[3494.08 → 3494.48] Okay.
[3494.78 → 3495.02] What?
[3495.26 → 3495.40] Yeah.
[3495.64 → 3496.90] Go to cam real quick.
[3497.34 → 3498.10] Go to cam, yeah.
[3499.06 → 3503.16] Change the audio from built-in slash none to the recorder that you want it to come from.
[3503.26 → 3503.70] Never mind.
[3503.78 → 3504.24] There they go.
[3505.06 → 3506.92] See, what would I do without you?
[3508.34 → 3510.16] What would I do without you?
[3510.22 → 3511.38] Probably a lot of the same stuff.
[3511.46 → 3512.32] It just wouldn't be as fun.
[3512.96 → 3513.52] Or it's good.
[3513.76 → 3513.98] Yeah.
[3514.10 → 3514.32] Yeah.
[3514.60 → 3514.96] Yay.
[3515.60 → 3516.28] Yay, Luke.
[3516.28 → 3525.00] So, Scrapyard War Season 5, Episode 1 is up already over on Float Playing Club.
[3525.26 → 3526.48] Welcome to Season 5.
[3526.48 → 3527.38] Oh, hold on.
[3527.70 → 3529.94] Well, you got to playback devices.
[3529.94 → 3530.94] Oh.
[3533.16 → 3533.60] Oh.
[3533.98 → 3540.10] I can't hear that in my monitor, which is terrifying because I have no idea what kind of volume
[3540.10 → 3540.96] I'm outputting at.
[3541.18 → 3545.76] So, I'm sure Twitch chat will be telling me if I broke their eardrums.
[3546.34 → 3548.80] If you plugged it into the computer directly, you would hear it.
[3551.82 → 3552.18] Yeah.
[3552.30 → 3556.26] In theory, that's how this is supposed to work, but I forgot which one I'm supposed to plug
[3556.26 → 3556.52] into.
[3556.72 → 3556.98] Okay.
[3557.54 → 3559.34] Because I'm really, really dumb.
[3559.46 → 3560.50] Apparently, they can hear it.
[3560.52 → 3561.88] It's a little bit too loud.
[3562.04 → 3562.40] Okay.
[3562.58 → 3562.84] Well, then.
[3562.88 → 3564.16] Most people are saying it's good, though.
[3564.42 → 3565.84] The vast majority of people are saying it's good.
[3565.98 → 3567.84] So, go like a little bit down and then probably okay.
[3567.84 → 3567.86] Okay.
[3567.86 → 3568.72] So, we'll call that good.
[3568.72 → 3572.66] So, you just want to skip to a 45-minute episode.
[3572.90 → 3574.40] Actually, 46-minute episode.
[3574.70 → 3576.16] Do you just want to skip to a random spot?
[3576.50 → 3576.82] Sure.
[3576.92 → 3578.68] I don't even know what's going to come up.
[3579.34 → 3579.66] Okay.
[3580.28 → 3581.92] Why are we watching in 360p?
[3582.12 → 3582.58] That's peasant.
[3582.70 → 3583.46] That's peasant stuff.
[3584.24 → 3584.90] Peasant stuff.
[3587.08 → 3587.82] Dun, dun, dun.
[3587.96 → 3589.38] I have before.
[3589.44 → 3590.10] Do you see that playback?
[3590.64 → 3591.86] Do you see that lightning fast playback?
[3592.16 → 3592.52] Hold on.
[3592.56 → 3592.80] Hold on.
[3593.02 → 3593.26] Stop.
[3593.56 → 3593.72] Here.
[3593.80 → 3593.94] Here.
[3594.00 → 3594.64] Listen for the click.
[3595.76 → 3596.12] Oh!
[3596.12 → 3601.36] One of the things, too, is that West Coast North America is, like, not even a good area for us.
[3601.60 → 3603.34] We're going to be $25 over.
[3603.66 → 3605.18] I don't even know what we're doing here.
[3605.52 → 3605.90] Me neither.
[3606.22 → 3607.22] $25 over.
[3608.16 → 3611.88] Oh, do we not have the preview working for such long clips yet?
[3611.90 → 3612.66] I guess, maybe.
[3612.82 → 3613.26] Interesting.
[3613.46 → 3614.38] That sort of makes sense.
[3614.46 → 3614.94] There's a report.
[3614.94 → 3616.16] So, like, two drives for 10 bucks?
[3617.16 → 3618.76] I wonder what we're figuring out here.
[3619.12 → 3619.98] It looks suspenseful.
[3620.80 → 3622.94] Oh, yeah, yeah, I know what that is.
[3622.94 → 3623.94] Yeah, I know what's going on.
[3623.94 → 3624.76] I know what's going on.
[3624.76 → 3626.48] I'm just going up Michael here.
[3627.32 → 3629.00] Let's see if Michael is going to come down here.
[3629.00 → 3629.50] Okay, okay, okay.
[3629.64 → 3630.36] So, that's enough.
[3630.94 → 3632.94] So, basically, what was the point of this?
[3633.06 → 3638.52] So, Scrapyard Wars Episode 1 is coming out, that, right there, is coming out on YouTube
[3638.52 → 3639.26] tomorrow.
[3639.50 → 3639.84] Tomorrow!
[3640.04 → 3646.22] If you want to see Episode 2 tomorrow, you can sign up for Float plane, and you can see
[3646.22 → 3651.32] that today, Episode 1 today, and then watch Episode 2 tomorrow and be totally caught up
[3651.32 → 3652.46] on the Float plane side of things.
[3652.46 → 3657.96] Also, really cool note, this is what I wasn't sure about telling you guys last time.
[3658.36 → 3662.92] We now have some load balancing going on with geos.
[3663.06 → 3670.40] So, a lot of people in Australia and the kind of general European area have noticed a lot
[3670.40 → 3670.92] of improvements.
[3670.92 → 3677.40] That's because we have some, like, kind of more on-location servers for you guys up and
[3677.40 → 3679.04] running with some load balancing going on.
[3679.10 → 3679.98] Do you want to say where they are?
[3680.42 → 3680.66] Yeah.
[3681.02 → 3681.94] Australia and...
[3681.94 → 3682.62] Oh, did you say that?
[3682.62 → 3684.18] So, Australia and the other ones in France.
[3684.58 → 3687.46] But it should be able to better serve you than ones in Canada.
[3687.46 → 3688.72] So, yeah.
[3688.84 → 3694.96] A lot of people from various countries around Europe have had a much better experience than
[3694.96 → 3697.18] before when everyone was just going through Canadian servers.
[3697.42 → 3699.46] We are going to continue to expand.
[3699.84 → 3703.66] So, if you're in an area that, like, isn't super great right now, ironically, where we
[3703.66 → 3705.52] are is, like, not the greatest.
[3705.78 → 3706.30] It's good.
[3706.38 → 3707.38] You just watch the playback.
[3707.74 → 3707.86] Yeah.
[3707.96 → 3708.46] It's good.
[3708.86 → 3710.26] It could be slightly better.
[3710.42 → 3711.74] And it will be slightly better.
[3712.52 → 3714.12] Because we will eventually have West Coast servers.
[3714.82 → 3715.06] Nice.
[3715.10 → 3715.52] But, yeah.
[3715.58 → 3720.02] If you're in an area, and you are consistently not getting super great bandwidth, I'm not
[3720.02 → 3720.98] hearing this very often.
[3721.18 → 3722.02] Almost not at all.
[3722.10 → 3725.98] But if you are, let me know where you're from and we will look into getting that better.
[3726.26 → 3729.62] To be clear, like, the infrastructure upgrades we're making right now have nothing to do
[3729.62 → 3730.82] with capacity for the platform.
[3731.02 → 3731.16] No.
[3732.60 → 3735.66] Like, there's a lot more people on it than you would probably think.
[3735.66 → 3741.96] But it's not, like, you know, a billion people or anything like YouTube or something.
[3742.20 → 3745.06] It's more just trying to make user experience better.
[3745.66 → 3745.84] Yeah.
[3746.34 → 3752.84] I mean, this is the kind of boring stuff that takes months to work on and figure out before
[3753.50 → 3755.94] you want to launch and, like, bring a bunch of other creators on the platform.
[3755.94 → 3758.88] Yeah, and it's frustrating when, like, we're an international group.
[3759.38 → 3763.58] And we have people from North America watching all the footage.
[3763.76 → 3764.76] And they're like, everything looks great.
[3764.76 → 3765.66] I can watch 1080p.
[3765.78 → 3766.44] It's snappy.
[3766.54 → 3766.84] Hooray.
[3766.94 → 3769.84] And then someone from Australia is like, I have to download it.
[3770.50 → 3770.74] Yeah.
[3770.78 → 3773.36] Or, like, I can sometimes watch it in 360p.
[3773.42 → 3774.52] And I'm like, that's not fair.
[3774.74 → 3776.02] People watch us from everywhere.
[3776.12 → 3778.44] I want this to work well for everyone, even if it costs us more.
[3778.48 → 3779.30] So now we're doing that.
[3779.30 → 3784.74] So we're actually going to do, like, a more float plane, another float plane Q&A after
[3784.74 → 3787.38] the WAN show if you guys want to kind of hang around for that.
[3787.52 → 3787.60] Yeah.
[3788.02 → 3790.80] Otherwise, I think we've got a few more pretty good topics for you.
[3792.08 → 3793.32] Anyway, one quick thing.
[3793.32 → 3793.62] Actually, no.
[3793.70 → 3794.48] We have, like, nothing.
[3794.58 → 3794.80] Oh, wait.
[3794.82 → 3795.52] No, we do have more.
[3795.76 → 3800.30] There's also a little teaser of episode two on float plane only.
[3800.78 → 3804.20] So if you're a float plane guy, and you haven't been on there in a couple of days, jump on there.
[3804.28 → 3806.16] Check out the teaser for Scrap board Wars episode two.
[3806.38 → 3808.26] It's pretty good.
[3810.36 → 3810.76] What?
[3811.28 → 3811.58] Huh.
[3811.92 → 3813.98] So, actually, I did not know about this.
[3814.02 → 3817.18] So this was posted by WMGroomAK on the forum.
[3817.18 → 3819.36] The original article is from Ars Technica.
[3819.36 → 3828.22] And it looks like Google gets to keep their trademark even though it has turned into a
[3828.22 → 3830.92] generic term for searching the web.
[3831.48 → 3836.62] So going back to our notes here, when a brand name becomes completely ubiquitous, like Thermos,
[3837.06 → 3839.18] I didn't even know Teleprompter was a brand name.
[3839.74 → 3840.14] Me neither.
[3840.30 → 3842.68] And Videotape didn't know that was a brand name.
[3842.68 → 3842.94] Oh, my goodness.
[3843.06 → 3843.32] Me neither.
[3843.46 → 3846.02] It can lose its legally protected status.
[3846.02 → 3848.42] So this process is called geneticize.
[3848.42 → 3854.66] And in 2012, Google filed a cyber-squatting complaint and claimed trademark infringement
[3854.66 → 3860.86] when a man registered 763 domain names that combined Google with other words and phrases,
[3861.04 → 3862.98] including GoogleDonaldTrump.com.
[3863.06 → 3864.02] Oh, what a jerk.
[3864.22 → 3865.26] I see what he was doing there.
[3865.32 → 3869.92] So the man filed an appeal citing geneticize, and the court ruled that Google still retains
[3869.92 → 3873.60] its trademark even if the term Google has become known for searching the internet.
[3873.74 → 3874.88] So how does that actually work, though?
[3874.88 → 3879.26] Um, I have no idea.
[3879.42 → 3881.12] I mean, John would be a more...
[3881.12 → 3882.02] Sort of...
[3882.02 → 3882.82] Because, like...
[3882.82 → 3884.16] Sensible person to talk about this.
[3884.40 → 3885.20] Hey, hey, hey, John!
[3887.60 → 3888.26] He's coming.
[3888.46 → 3888.92] He's coming.
[3889.08 → 3890.30] All right, I'm giving up my seat.
[3890.42 → 3891.22] I'm giving up my seat.
[3891.36 → 3891.62] Okay.
[3891.90 → 3893.12] John's coming in to talk about geneticize.
[3893.12 → 3893.60] Geneticize.
[3894.44 → 3895.54] John, geneticize.
[3895.70 → 3896.06] All right.
[3897.20 → 3898.04] This thing, eh?
[3898.14 → 3898.38] Okay.
[3898.66 → 3899.02] Hit me.
[3899.94 → 3900.38] Or Luke.
[3900.98 → 3901.54] Hit something.
[3901.78 → 3901.98] Yeah.
[3902.66 → 3903.10] There you go.
[3903.20 → 3903.50] Good job.
[3904.10 → 3904.72] What's up, Twitch?
[3904.72 → 3905.02] What's that?
[3905.02 → 3905.26] Geneticize.
[3905.40 → 3911.04] Google almost potentially lost its trademark on Google because, like, oh, I'll just Google
[3911.04 → 3914.66] it has become a general term for looking something up on the internet.
[3915.58 → 3920.06] Someone sued them over it because they tried to take down a bunch of his domains and blah,
[3920.06 → 3920.50] blah, blah, blah, blah.
[3920.52 → 3921.70] And he was like, okay.
[3921.70 → 3922.32] So you can read that.
[3922.32 → 3923.34] You're using a lot of pronouns there.
[3923.40 → 3923.76] Okay, let's see.
[3923.76 → 3947.20] So how does that work?
[3948.00 → 3952.06] Isn't that literally the even though Google has become known for searching the internet,
[3952.14 → 3953.96] isn't that the whole point of geneticize?
[3954.48 → 3955.22] It is.
[3955.90 → 3960.38] Geneticize is kind of, it's not a hard and fast rule.
[3960.60 → 3965.06] It's not like, oh, after a certain amount of time or a certain number of people say it
[3965.06 → 3967.32] in a generic manner, it becomes generic.
[3967.48 → 3968.42] It's a little bit squishy.
[3969.20 → 3973.82] But they do look at things like, and I don't know what happened in this case because I just
[3973.82 → 3976.34] had the one little note in front of me, but they could have looked at something
[3976.34 → 3979.44] like, oh, has Google taken a lot of steps to protect its trademark?
[3980.22 → 3989.12] You know, back in the day before, when photocopiers were still like more of a cutting edge thing
[3989.12 → 3993.92] than they are now, people would say, oh, Xerox it, you know, to make a copy, even though
[3993.92 → 3996.38] there are tons of copiers not made by Xerox, right?
[3996.74 → 4003.94] So Xerox actually took out like a big newspaper ad saying, or telling people, say, make a copy.
[4003.94 → 4007.12] Don't say Xerox it because they're trying to protect their trademark.
[4007.42 → 4011.82] So if Google, maybe Google showed that they were taking active steps to protect their trademark.
[4012.26 → 4016.68] Maybe it also helps them because Google puts their Google branding on way more things than
[4016.68 → 4017.24] just a browser.
[4017.42 → 4017.84] They do.
[4018.08 → 4018.28] Yeah.
[4018.54 → 4019.22] That might help.
[4019.26 → 4019.98] I have no idea.
[4020.24 → 4020.84] Yeah, maybe.
[4021.20 → 4024.44] It's, like I said, it's kind of a squishy area of law.
[4024.58 → 4027.30] I'm not surprised that Google won.
[4027.30 → 4032.82] It takes like quite, yeah, I mean, just aside from the money they have to spend, it takes
[4032.82 → 4036.34] a lot for a trademark to become generic.
[4036.80 → 4038.78] So there we go.
[4039.02 → 4039.20] Cool.
[4039.28 → 4039.56] That's it.
[4039.70 → 4040.28] I think that's it.
[4040.28 → 4041.16] Carry on, gentlemen.
[4044.16 → 4044.98] I'm back.
[4045.32 → 4048.90] The FAA's drone registry requirement got shot down.
[4049.16 → 4050.94] The original article is from TechCrunch.
[4051.00 → 4051.96] Let's go ahead and pull that up.
[4051.96 → 4061.16] But basically, a federal appeals court shoots down the FAA's drone registry requirement.
[4061.80 → 4067.18] It's likely that the FAA will appeal this decision or take some other approach, which
[4067.18 → 4070.36] seems to be very common in the states with stuff like net neutrality being tried like
[4070.36 → 4072.08] a billion times under a billion different names.
[4072.28 → 4076.80] So drone hobbyist John Taylor argued that the Federal Aviation Administration doesn't have
[4076.80 → 4080.58] jurisdiction over what the law classifies as model aircraft.
[4080.58 → 4086.06] The registration database was proposed in 2015 to address growing drone ownership in
[4086.06 → 4089.58] the U.S., which has brought with it privacy and safety concerns.
[4090.68 → 4092.78] So that's basically where we're at on that.
[4093.06 → 4094.40] So stay tuned for more.
[4095.54 → 4101.38] And yeah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[4101.38 → 4101.78] Okay.
[4101.84 → 4107.36] Winners of the Case Mod World Series 2017 posted by Rod Rosenberg on the forum.
[4107.76 → 4108.94] Man, I hate that guy.
[4109.16 → 4109.72] Was it Rod?
[4109.72 → 4111.02] Yeah, I don't know.
[4111.08 → 4111.90] I don't know if Rod won.
[4112.02 → 4113.86] Did he post his own winning?
[4115.26 → 4115.90] Let's see.
[4116.20 → 4117.70] No, no, it doesn't look like it.
[4117.80 → 4119.36] Was he in it or was he a judge?
[4119.48 → 4120.72] Yeah, I don't...
[4120.72 → 4123.16] I'm feeling he has something to do with this.
[4123.16 → 4124.54] I'm just trying to find like a...
[4124.54 → 4125.04] Oh, okay.
[4125.28 → 4126.20] No, there's...
[4126.20 → 4129.24] There's no BS mods?
[4129.24 → 4132.08] Maybe he says something in the link?
[4132.88 → 4134.36] Yeah, I can't click on it though.
[4134.36 → 4135.82] Okay.
[4135.82 → 4136.66] Do-do-do-do-do.
[4137.58 → 4137.98] Okay.
[4138.10 → 4140.32] So the first winner was...
[4140.32 → 4141.66] Oh, no.
[4141.70 → 4142.96] I think he just thinks it's cool.
[4143.20 → 4143.58] That's cool.
[4143.58 → 4144.84] Mega by S...
[4144.84 → 4145.80] S-Pick Russia?
[4147.66 → 4147.92] Wow.
[4147.96 → 4148.50] S-Pick Russia?
[4148.92 → 4149.32] No, no.
[4149.38 → 4150.30] Not FPS Russia.
[4150.40 → 4151.14] That's a different thing.
[4151.42 → 4152.18] But good try.
[4152.26 → 4152.56] Good try.
[4152.64 → 4153.14] Thank you, Nick.
[4154.10 → 4154.94] It looks cool.
[4155.48 → 4158.32] That's apparently made out of a Master Case 5.
[4158.32 → 4164.54] It looks like they just chopped it like pretty early on.
[4165.00 → 4166.78] Completely unrecognizable.
[4167.04 → 4167.36] Well, no.
[4167.60 → 4169.18] The very bit at the front.
[4169.34 → 4170.38] This bit is recognizable.
[4170.58 → 4170.68] Yeah.
[4170.68 → 4171.24] And then that's it.
[4172.06 → 4172.74] Then it stops.
[4174.72 → 4177.04] Undergoes a complete structural change.
[4177.22 → 4177.36] Yeah.
[4177.42 → 4178.88] We noticed the complete structural change.
[4178.90 → 4179.52] We did notice that.
[4179.52 → 4180.50] Pretty intense.
[4180.62 → 4180.74] Yeah.
[4180.88 → 4181.04] Yeah.
[4181.70 → 4182.86] Like, hey, here's a case.
[4182.86 → 4184.92] We'll just take the top quarter of it.
[4185.14 → 4186.34] You can take the rest.
[4186.34 → 4188.70] We don't need it.
[4189.16 → 4189.58] Not a big deal.
[4189.60 → 4190.08] That's awesome.
[4190.44 → 4191.60] What is that based on?
[4191.96 → 4192.54] That's pretty cool.
[4192.54 → 4193.48] Like a stacker or something?
[4193.60 → 4195.28] Futuristic Ideas and Metal.
[4196.14 → 4197.46] Modded Elite 130.
[4198.18 → 4198.48] Okay.
[4198.58 → 4198.72] Yeah.
[4198.72 → 4199.32] I can see that.
[4199.60 → 4199.80] Cool.
[4200.20 → 4201.16] PSU on the side.
[4201.64 → 4202.96] Just put the PSU over there.
[4203.20 → 4204.22] It seems to be kind of open.
[4204.44 → 4205.76] Like, you can see the graphics card.
[4205.96 → 4206.12] Yeah.
[4206.12 → 4206.88] That's actually pretty neat.
[4206.90 → 4207.64] That's actually pretty cool.
[4207.70 → 4208.22] It looks perfect.
[4208.42 → 4208.56] Yeah.
[4209.04 → 4209.50] All right.
[4209.50 → 4210.38] And that's pretty much it.
[4210.38 → 4212.16] Thank you for tuning into the WAN Show.
[4212.56 → 4213.98] We will see you again next week.
[4214.18 → 4214.38] Yay.
[4214.38 → 4215.02] Same bat time.
[4215.18 → 4216.00] Same bat.
[4216.00 → 4216.64] Channel.
[4220.36 → 4221.28] The outro?
[4221.92 → 4222.12] Oh.
[4223.30 → 4223.56] Yeah.
[4223.58 → 4225.14] I'm really not firing on all cylinders today.
[4225.20 → 4225.62] That's cool.
[4228.28 → 4229.26] Actually, I am.
[4229.38 → 4230.40] I'm just in other places.
[4233.82 → 4234.40] What's up?
[4234.78 → 4237.40] Someone's like, finally a good WAN Show episode.
[4237.82 → 4238.74] Good job, guys.
[4239.08 → 4239.64] I'm surprised.
[4240.64 → 4241.32] That was decent.
[4241.78 → 4242.30] We're so hungry.
[4242.50 → 4243.02] Thank you.
[4243.10 → 4245.04] Last week sucked, but I thought the one before that was pretty good.
[4245.36 → 4245.68] Yeah.
[4248.18 → 4250.92] The after-party for last week was wonderful.
[4251.16 → 4251.68] Bloop.
[4251.68 → 4251.86] Bloop.
