[0.00 → 6.92] Hey, hey, it's WAN Showtime again. We've got a great show for you guys today.
[7.86 → 10.80] Unfortunately, you aren't watching it. You're watching the WAN Show.
[11.62 → 15.36] Oh, lol.
[16.02 → 23.52] You know, I really feel like when I'm old, what are those Muppets names? The hecklers? The old man hecklers?
[24.10 → 27.86] Oh, I haven't watched The Muppets in about 25 years. I don't know.
[27.86 → 29.02] Well, my...
[29.02 → 29.94] I think I know who you're talking about.
[30.00 → 38.76] My goal in life is to basically be those guys when I'm old. Muppet, Hecklers, I don't know what their names are.
[38.78 → 40.08] Well, that's not very difficult to do.
[40.18 → 41.82] Ah, Tattler and Waldorf.
[42.02 → 42.70] Oh, those guys.
[42.70 → 47.50] Okay, so weren't they supposed to be sort of like weird versions like Siskel and Ebert or something?
[47.70 → 53.08] Yeah, I think so. I think so. And everything, everything is a one-liner with them.
[53.08 → 56.68] They're like, this is a great show. Yeah, great at putting me to sleep.
[56.68 → 61.84] Oh, man. I aspire to nothing more, actually.
[63.10 → 67.10] That's going to be very easy to do. You're setting the bar very low for yourself.
[67.10 → 70.80] I think I'm basically at... I think I'm basically there now with...
[70.80 → 72.86] You're kind of an orange. You're just not old yet.
[72.86 → 75.32] So that's all I have to achieve.
[75.46 → 77.14] You just have to age. That's it.
[77.22 → 79.04] To do everything I want out of my life.
[79.12 → 85.10] I just have to continue to make it around the sun like another 40 or so more times, and then I'm great.
[85.24 → 87.92] You live in Canada. They told me this was a safe country, so it's probably fine.
[87.92 → 91.04] All right, so welcome to the WAN Show, you guys.
[91.12 → 100.28] We've got a bunch of great topics for you today, including Intel uncharacteristically throwing shade at the competition,
[100.62 → 104.46] which for the first time in like a decade is AMD.
[106.34 → 110.76] It's like the insecurity is just dripping out of the computer screen.
[110.98 → 111.28] Right?
[111.28 → 113.70] It was pretty brutal. It was pretty brutal.
[114.70 → 125.56] Also, AMD's Ry zen Thread ripper and Ry zen 3 have tons of new updates in a video post that they created earlier on this week.
[126.58 → 134.14] The Skylike X VRM and thermal paste and power consumption mess has been explored by Tom's Hardware,
[134.14 → 141.30] and we've got John here to specially cover a legal topic that we wanted to get into.
[141.92 → 143.26] Which one was it? Where is it?
[143.36 → 147.46] The Zillow copyright infringement case.
[147.86 → 151.38] Which sounds a lot less interesting than it actually is.
[152.02 → 153.04] There we go. Zillow.
[154.20 → 161.52] Massive website tries to sue a satirical blogger over photos that Zillow doesn't even own.
[162.14 → 162.74] Brilliant.
[162.74 → 163.24] Yeah.
[163.36 → 164.30] So it's going to be a good one.
[164.38 → 167.04] So let's go ahead and roll the intro, and we'll see you on the other side.
[167.10 → 167.70] Roll the intro.
[168.32 → 169.00] Yes, it worked.
[170.80 → 172.56] I think we might be a little bit out of focus.
[173.84 → 175.56] Well, that's okay. I'm never focused.
[176.16 → 176.46] Ah!
[177.92 → 180.20] I mean, you did just take the joke right out of my head.
[181.14 → 182.64] So I'll probably give you credit for that.
[183.38 → 184.36] You won't miss it.
[184.36 → 184.86] Ah!
[187.02 → 187.88] I don't know where I'm going.
[187.88 → 189.88] Okay. All right. I fix it.
[190.12 → 191.20] Comment, comment, poo!
[192.74 → 193.56] Fresh box!
[193.56 → 198.34] And put that back so that the intro will roll properly next time.
[198.46 → 200.56] That is indeed why I do that.
[201.18 → 203.02] Did Twitter just crash?
[203.14 → 205.58] How do you even do this?
[205.64 → 207.38] Is it Twitter's fault or is it Chrome's fault?
[207.54 → 208.16] Maybe both.
[208.28 → 208.96] I don't know.
[209.12 → 210.90] It could very easily be both.
[210.90 → 212.46] And Pella's over here playing with the focus.
[212.56 → 213.74] Yeah. Oh, thank you, Pella.
[213.90 → 215.60] That is just wonderful.
[215.70 → 216.70] And the tweet is up.
[216.70 → 218.86] I didn't even know this, though.
[218.88 → 220.92] This is how double tweets happen.
[221.34 → 221.72] Okay?
[222.28 → 222.72] Chrome.
[223.50 → 224.24] Thank you.
[225.30 → 225.92] All right.
[225.92 → 233.66] So the original topic here is from, wow, I actually managed to prepare even less than usual for the WAN show today.
[233.72 → 235.84] I do not have my HDMI cable plugged in.
[236.26 → 239.16] And somehow I managed to, my muscle memory didn't help me here.
[239.22 → 240.86] I managed to put my mouse in the wrong spot.
[241.42 → 241.94] All right.
[242.36 → 243.20] We're not Boy Scouts.
[243.20 → 244.38] We're not really prepared.
[244.50 → 245.36] We're going to jump right in.
[245.42 → 248.58] This was originally posted over on Ars Technica.
[249.60 → 250.74] Oh, we're doing this.
[250.80 → 250.94] Okay.
[251.14 → 253.54] In a nutshell, here we go.
[253.90 → 254.58] Linus' screen.
[254.68 → 255.20] Is it going to work?
[255.26 → 255.76] Is it going to work?
[255.84 → 256.04] Is it going to?
[256.08 → 256.50] Oh, wow.
[256.54 → 257.20] There we go.
[257.30 → 257.76] Yes.
[258.96 → 259.28] Okay.
[260.16 → 262.72] So take me through this, John.
[262.96 → 264.36] What is going on here?
[265.06 → 270.78] So as you can see on the screen grab there, it's a site called Mc Mansion Hell.
[270.78 → 275.72] And for those of you who don't know, or probably mostly people not from the U.S.
[275.76 → 276.72] Yeah, what's a Mc Mansion?
[277.16 → 283.54] A Mc Mansion is a large yet relatively cheaply built house.
[283.72 → 289.62] It was, they were building them all over the place in the U.S. before the housing bubble burst in the late 2000s.
[289.96 → 295.88] And they're larger, but like I said, slightly cheaper, more cheaply built houses.
[295.88 → 301.38] And so this blogger started this website called Mc Mansion Hell.
[301.56 → 304.38] And this blogger is, I think, an architectural student.
[304.74 → 312.44] So she was going through and posting all these pictures of homes that she considered to be Mc Mansions and telling people,
[312.90 → 316.14] oh, these are terrible buildings that have terrible architecture.
[316.38 → 317.24] Here are the reasons why.
[317.42 → 319.26] And this is a regular blog that she updated.
[319.50 → 320.16] It sounds pretty funny.
[320.16 → 321.26] Yeah, it was pretty popular.
[321.42 → 329.04] She had lots of visitors who liked her sort of snarky take on, oh, LOL, you can scrape these windows off with a paint knife.
[329.14 → 329.64] This is terrible.
[330.44 → 334.74] So she got a lot of these pictures from Zillow, which is like this huge sort of like real estate site.
[334.86 → 338.80] If you want to sell your house, a lot of people use Zillow to post pictures of the house on there.
[339.06 → 339.92] Sure, okay.
[340.10 → 340.24] Yeah.
[340.94 → 342.66] Anyway, Zillow got wind of this.
[342.66 → 352.26] And so they sent her a very angry cease and desist letter saying, oh, you're infringing on our copyrights, and you can't do this and this and that.
[352.76 → 354.92] So this kind of blew up.
[355.00 → 355.72] She freaked out.
[355.86 → 357.32] She's like, my livelihood's at stake.
[357.70 → 359.56] Yeah, so she could lose her job.
[359.78 → 361.96] But Zillow didn't take these photos.
[362.80 → 366.38] No, they didn't, which is like a huge wrinkle in this case.
[366.38 → 371.32] So the photos that people, like they upload them to Zillow, right?
[371.42 → 375.68] So if you want to sell your house, you take your own photos of your own house and you upload them.
[375.72 → 376.76] The photos are yours.
[377.40 → 379.40] And when, so I had to look at.
[379.40 → 380.86] Your hot house, you take your own photos of your own house.
[380.86 → 381.38] What are we doing here?
[381.40 → 382.14] That's what you sound like.
[382.26 → 382.74] Sorry, go ahead.
[382.94 → 383.82] That's what I sound like.
[383.82 → 384.42] Okay, thank you.
[384.58 → 385.96] I know what I sound like.
[385.96 → 388.40] I have plenty of people in the tech quickie comments.
[388.72 → 390.84] Hey, John, do you know that you sound like.
[390.90 → 391.98] Are you from the south?
[392.20 → 393.80] Yeah, where are you from?
[393.80 → 395.94] Yeah, it's what do you have in your mouth?
[395.94 → 396.70] What's wrong with your voice?
[396.76 → 399.92] Anyway, so I think someone has asked me that one time.
[400.06 → 402.04] Okay, anyway, but all right.
[402.10 → 404.18] So you take the pictures, you put them on Zillow.
[404.30 → 409.20] I had to look at Zillow's terms of service, and they say, okay, if you put pictures on Zillow,
[409.38 → 412.86] you're giving us a non-exclusive license to use them.
[413.00 → 413.94] Yeah, that's pretty typical.
[413.94 → 421.72] Like even on the LTT forum, I believe your text content, we actually say we own, but pictures posted,
[422.38 → 424.28] we did something along those lines.
[424.28 → 430.74] And, okay, so if you look at if Zillow can even sue, because that's one of the big questions.
[430.94 → 433.86] It's like, do they even have standing to sue?
[434.24 → 437.88] And standing in laws, it's kind of a simple concept to understand, right?
[437.94 → 443.40] If you're going to take someone to court, you have to be a party to whatever the dispute is.
[443.40 → 447.32] If someone walks in here and punches Linus in the mouth and knocks a few of his teeth out.
[447.32 → 447.44] I see.
[447.88 → 448.04] Yeah.
[448.14 → 449.78] So my neighbour.
[449.94 → 450.80] Well, maybe you could.
[450.90 → 451.86] I can't sue on your behalf.
[452.00 → 457.90] My livelihood is at stake because my boss can't come to work and shoot the videos that I write.
[458.10 → 459.44] Therefore, but so.
[459.68 → 461.48] It's a bit more tenuous, but.
[461.56 → 465.04] But let's say you were some complete freaking random.
[465.26 → 465.46] Yeah.
[465.70 → 465.90] Yeah.
[465.90 → 469.36] You can't sue because you have nothing at stake.
[469.36 → 475.82] Yeah, well, well, if someone, okay, suppose that Linus and I were just friends, and we're walking down the street together.
[476.10 → 476.92] Suppose we're friends.
[478.00 → 481.22] Suppose someone comes up to him, just punches him in the face.
[481.44 → 485.28] I can't sue that guy on Linus' behalf.
[485.36 → 486.36] He has to do it himself.
[486.36 → 490.54] So the concept is that how the concept applies here.
[490.64 → 492.16] Man, I've had way too much caffeine in him.
[492.20 → 492.78] Just all over the place.
[494.16 → 499.80] The way the concept applies here is that the Fifth Circuit, which is, no, it was the Ninth.
[499.82 → 500.10] I'm sorry.
[500.18 → 504.18] But the Ninth Circuit in the U.S., very influential appeals court right below the Supreme Court.
[504.44 → 504.60] Yeah.
[504.70 → 512.92] There was a case from a couple of years ago where they ruled that you can have standing to sue about infringement of someone else's copyright.
[512.92 → 516.48] Only if you have some sort of exclusive right.
[516.72 → 520.62] Which they, in their own terms of service, do not have.
[520.72 → 521.02] Right.
[521.18 → 524.50] I don't know if it says non-exclusive specifically, but they don't.
[524.50 → 526.22] But it doesn't specifically say it's exclusive.
[526.22 → 526.46] Correct.
[526.50 → 527.80] Which you would have to do.
[527.86 → 528.40] Correct.
[528.66 → 528.94] Right.
[528.94 → 536.76] So this is, whether they even have standing to sue the Mc Mansion hell blogger is very, very, very unclear.
[537.44 → 540.62] If I were to hazard a guess, I would say they do not.
[540.62 → 544.30] But it didn't stop her from being embroiled in this big legal battle.
[544.40 → 548.06] She's got some pretty prominent IP lawyers on her side right now.
[548.38 → 551.96] But it's an interesting question about, you know, who gets to use.
[551.96 → 553.60] This could affect dank memes forever.
[553.86 → 554.92] It absolutely could.
[555.00 → 556.64] Who gets to use Pepe?
[556.84 → 560.44] Which is why this conversation is important, by the way.
[560.48 → 561.84] Which is why we're having it on WAN Show.
[561.84 → 568.12] But honestly, I'm still not over how low-key burned I just got about a minute or two ago there.
[569.14 → 569.74] The friends comment?
[569.74 → 570.92] Suppose we were friends.
[571.10 → 571.40] No, no.
[571.64 → 572.10] See, with you.
[572.18 → 574.50] I qualified the statement by saying just.
[577.08 → 583.64] Let the records show I said just instead of friends plus co-workers slash Linus being my boss.
[583.64 → 586.40] On Facebook, our current status would be it's complicated.
[587.26 → 587.52] Okay.
[587.66 → 587.86] Okay.
[588.02 → 589.12] See what you've done.
[589.26 → 590.46] You've gone on.
[590.58 → 591.60] You've made this something it isn't.
[591.66 → 595.00] Now there's going to be more horrible fan fiction written about this.
[595.58 → 595.98] Thanks.
[596.24 → 598.86] And now you're the one who invited it.
[599.04 → 599.94] You're the one who invited it.
[599.94 → 600.30] You know what?
[600.32 → 601.38] Oh, it's going to happen either way.
[601.38 → 601.80] Let's have Luke join us.
[601.86 → 602.02] Come on.
[602.02 → 605.26] Let's have Luke join us for a fan fiction extravaganza.
[607.66 → 610.20] If we're going to invite it, we might as well invite it.
[610.80 → 611.54] What's happening?
[611.68 → 614.90] It's just that I don't want you to come between us.
[615.28 → 615.74] Oh, okay.
[615.74 → 623.38] I use the words just friends to imply an illegal hypothetical involving me and Linus and things happen.
[623.70 → 624.18] So, yeah.
[624.20 → 625.70] Quit getting naked, says Twitch chat.
[627.76 → 629.94] Speaking of violating the terms of service.
[630.10 → 630.30] Yeah.
[630.56 → 630.72] Yeah.
[630.72 → 640.34] So, basically, Zillow still says they – what do they want?
[640.82 → 642.20] They want her to take down the photos.
[643.10 → 643.86] Oh, okay.
[643.86 → 654.94] But what's interesting about this – another thing that's interesting about this is that even if some court said Zillow has standing to sue, which I doubt, but if it gets to that phase.
[655.06 → 655.34] Yeah.
[655.34 → 666.76] One of the biggest things that courts look for, whether to determine if a use of the copyrighted photo or something is fair use – that term gets thrown around a lot, fair use – is the effect on the market for the work.
[667.26 → 667.42] Right.
[667.42 → 674.52] Who the heck is going to, like, start selling their random pictures of their random Mc Mansions and make tons of money off of them?
[674.78 → 675.04] Right.
[675.08 → 678.66] You know, so – and I think – so there's a strong argument.
[678.66 → 684.40] I'm not saying it'll win, necessarily, but there's a strong argument saying there's no real market for these pictures that's being affected.
[684.76 → 685.04] Right.
[685.08 → 686.38] So, she wants to argue fair use.
[686.48 → 688.14] But, again, like I said, there's a standing issue.
[688.20 → 689.10] We may not even get to that point.
[689.32 → 689.60] So –
[689.60 → 689.94] Okay.
[690.14 → 690.58] Got it.
[690.58 → 690.98] Yeah.
[691.08 → 693.54] There are multiple hoops to jump through in law.
[693.64 → 696.12] If you've ever fought a traffic ticket, I'm sure you've figured that out.
[696.90 → 697.58] All right.
[697.68 → 697.94] So, yeah.
[698.02 → 698.42] Well, thanks, John.
[698.46 → 705.16] I'm going to have Luke tag in because he actually just arrived back from the one and only Silicon Valley.
[705.34 → 707.72] Can we talk about the Juicer real fast before he tags out?
[707.74 → 709.38] We can talk about the Juicer.
[709.56 → 710.10] Okay, hold on.
[710.14 → 711.06] Is that even in the doc?
[711.20 → 713.06] I put it in their like 45 minutes ago.
[713.08 → 713.12] All right.
[713.16 → 713.48] All right.
[713.58 → 714.20] Let's bring –
[714.20 → 715.24] Extremely quickly we'll do this.
[715.24 → 716.12] We're bringing up the Juicer.
[716.34 → 716.98] Tell me about – okay.
[717.06 → 718.54] So, this is also from ours.
[718.54 → 721.04] Have we ever talked about this thing before?
[721.36 → 722.58] I know we haven't on the channel.
[722.70 → 724.38] Have we ever talked about it like on the WAN show?
[724.56 → 725.54] Because I don't believe we have.
[725.64 → 726.14] Not much.
[726.36 → 727.06] We have – yes.
[727.16 → 727.82] A little bit?
[727.98 → 728.12] Yeah.
[728.26 → 729.14] Luke says a little bit.
[729.18 → 730.38] We said, yeah, it's dumb.
[730.74 → 730.98] Okay.
[731.02 → 732.60] I'll give you a really quick TLDR.
[733.74 → 741.88] Also, if you've seen any of Critical's videos on YouTube, I'm sure you've seen this where he lampooned this ridiculous thing called the Juicer.
[741.88 → 746.34] And it is a juicer that originally cost $800.
[746.86 → 748.46] They've since dropped the price to $400.
[748.62 → 752.98] And now it's going to be down to below $200, according to this article from Ars Technica.
[753.14 → 755.36] But all it is this thing.
[755.62 → 757.32] They ship you packets.
[757.66 → 762.16] You know, they look like giant, you know, hot or cold packets or whatever.
[762.54 → 764.30] They cost about $5 to $7 each.
[764.72 → 766.12] You put them inside this thing.
[766.22 → 767.20] You shut a door on it.
[767.30 → 767.96] You press a button.
[768.08 → 770.04] And it has to be connected to the internet at all times.
[770.34 → 772.02] It squeezes the juice packet.
[772.14 → 773.64] And two minutes later, you have a glass of juice.
[774.36 → 775.92] That's literally what it does.
[775.92 → 779.64] And it originally sold for $700.
[780.02 → 781.00] But it was very expensive.
[781.00 → 781.28] Okay?
[781.28 → 786.84] So, apparently, they've cut the price already.
[787.20 → 788.66] They've cut the price down to $200.
[789.20 → 791.26] And they've laid off a bunch of their staff.
[792.02 → 796.42] And my question is, my question was why it was so expensive to begin with.
[796.76 → 798.54] And apparently, this thing was this.
[798.80 → 801.06] It was ridiculously over-engineered.
[801.16 → 803.54] Some website did a teardown of it.
[803.54 → 807.26] And it was a really, really high build quality, which is great.
[807.92 → 808.04] But...
[808.04 → 808.82] Sorry?
[809.26 → 809.58] AVE.
[810.54 → 811.42] Oh, AVE.
[812.12 → 812.38] Right.
[812.50 → 812.90] Okay.
[813.02 → 814.62] AVE did the teardown.
[814.70 → 815.16] Is that right, Luke?
[815.34 → 815.68] Okay.
[815.74 → 816.70] So, he did the teardown.
[817.32 → 820.22] And the thing was, like I said, absurdly over-engineered.
[820.30 → 825.12] And all it was doing was just squeezing a bag of, like, fruits and vegetables to make juice out of it.
[825.12 → 828.66] So, they decided to lower the price down to $200.
[829.20 → 837.88] But I'm wondering why not just get an actual, like, baller juicer from Bed Bath & Beyond or somewhere or Amazon for that price?
[838.10 → 845.12] And you could even get, like, an Amazon Fresh subscription and have the veggies and the fruits delivered to your door if you're too lazy to go to the store to buy them.
[845.66 → 847.22] Instead of this.
[849.04 → 850.84] I mean, could you see...
[850.84 → 853.56] Is there a universe where you would find this useful, Linus?
[853.56 → 856.80] Like, if you want a fresh juice after a badminton game or something?
[857.00 → 857.86] So, I have a Vitamin.
[858.36 → 858.70] Okay.
[859.26 → 863.06] So, basically, everything else can just get crapped on.
[865.06 → 865.76] So, no.
[866.16 → 866.64] So, no.
[867.08 → 867.62] There we go.
[868.42 → 878.04] And the stupid thing is that, like, even at the $400 price point, you could get a used Vitamin, which, by the way, will probably run for, like, 50 years.
[878.18 → 879.88] Because those things are unbelievable.
[881.12 → 882.24] For the same price.
[882.24 → 883.78] And then you could put literally anything.
[884.02 → 885.68] Like, you could put a child in a Vitamin.
[886.68 → 888.74] We don't advise you do that.
[889.08 → 889.62] You could put a child.
[889.62 → 890.68] Has never happened.
[891.30 → 892.86] Well, I can't say it's never happened.
[893.02 → 893.26] Yes.
[893.42 → 896.22] It's never happened to my children or in my presence.
[897.02 → 898.54] Or at my instruction.
[899.24 → 899.62] There we go.
[899.62 → 901.50] Am I covering all my legal bases right now?
[901.50 → 902.80] I think you are.
[902.88 → 903.36] Please do not.
[903.48 → 904.68] I know that.
[904.86 → 908.28] I know that the small children cry, but please don't put them into Vitamin.
[908.38 → 908.68] Anyway.
[908.92 → 909.14] Okay.
[909.74 → 913.16] What is this Modest Proposal?
[913.32 → 914.96] It's like you're channelling the guy who wrote Modest Proposal.
[914.96 → 915.64] Yeah, basically.
[915.96 → 916.82] This is so strange.
[916.82 → 917.38] Oh, crap.
[917.52 → 918.06] Hold on.
[918.12 → 918.38] Hold on.
[918.44 → 918.80] Jonathan.
[919.18 → 919.38] Wait.
[919.48 → 919.60] Wait.
[919.64 → 920.32] Don't tell me!
[922.08 → 923.58] No, you already gave me enough of a hint.
[923.64 → 923.90] Swift.
[924.10 → 924.36] Okay.
[924.62 → 924.80] Well.
[924.92 → 925.26] Dang it.
[926.00 → 928.12] We all know how intelligent you are, Linus.
[928.14 → 928.70] It'll be all right.
[928.70 → 933.24] Well, remembering facts is not an indication of intelligence necessarily.
[933.42 → 937.80] Although, a complete inability to remember any facts could be an indicator that you're
[937.80 → 938.38] not intelligent.
[938.60 → 941.64] So, what does that mean about people who remember a lot of facts?
[942.26 → 942.62] Nothing.
[944.28 → 944.50] Yeah.
[944.88 → 947.30] I say that's accurate.
[947.92 → 948.58] All right.
[948.74 → 950.08] Of course, a Twitch chat.
[950.16 → 951.72] Linus likes blended children confirmed.
[951.88 → 953.20] No, I don't like them.
[953.28 → 955.66] Why would I put them in a blender if I liked them?
[957.80 → 958.20] Wait.
[958.20 → 959.06] What were we talking about?
[959.80 → 960.12] Okay.
[960.18 → 961.90] The flavour of dead children, apparently.
[961.90 → 963.48] On to our next topic.
[963.72 → 964.02] I see.
[964.52 → 965.86] So, thanks, John.
[966.06 → 966.74] Thank you, Linus.
[966.82 → 969.26] I feel like I'm supposed to shake your hand, but you work here.
[969.36 → 969.70] I work with you every day.
[969.70 → 970.42] I see you every day.
[970.56 → 970.82] It's fine.
[970.96 → 971.50] Yeah, I know.
[971.62 → 975.74] But it's like, I feel like we're having guests on a talk show right now.
[975.82 → 976.80] And that's what they always do.
[976.86 → 978.48] They're always like, yeah, John, welcome to the show.
[978.82 → 980.14] Hey, John, thanks for being on.
[980.18 → 981.40] And we'll see you after the break.
[981.60 → 981.84] Yeah.
[982.40 → 983.08] Fresh books.
[983.40 → 984.24] Don't shake my hand.
[984.24 → 984.42] Yeah.
[984.54 → 984.76] No.
[984.76 → 985.32] You're not.
[985.32 → 989.08] You're not who's doing the light show now, Colbert.
[989.30 → 989.94] Yeah, Colbert.
[990.20 → 990.98] I'm not Colbert.
[991.28 → 991.90] You know what?
[992.82 → 993.18] That hurts.
[993.18 → 995.22] I just want to say thanks for having me on the show.
[995.34 → 995.50] Yeah.
[995.58 → 997.14] I really appreciate you having me here today.
[997.14 → 997.78] He knows what's up.
[997.90 → 998.40] He knows what.
[998.50 → 1000.86] He just made you look so bad.
[1000.86 → 1002.28] I really appreciate the way I'm showing you.
[1002.28 → 1003.80] First he called me not a friend.
[1004.40 → 1006.00] Then he's like, you're not Colbert.
[1006.32 → 1007.50] Like, fine.
[1009.14 → 1010.52] Oh, man.
[1011.18 → 1011.58] Okay.
[1011.96 → 1014.18] So do you want to talk about where you were?
[1014.30 → 1015.44] Like on a very high level?
[1015.58 → 1015.74] Yeah.
[1015.84 → 1016.04] I can.
[1016.14 → 1016.66] Hell yeah.
[1016.78 → 1017.30] Let's do it.
[1017.54 → 1018.64] I got freaking...
[1018.64 → 1019.40] You got burned.
[1019.46 → 1019.90] Owned.
[1019.90 → 1020.92] You were down there for one day.
[1020.96 → 1022.50] Only one side of your face.
[1022.52 → 1023.48] And like...
[1023.48 → 1024.34] What are you doing?
[1024.52 → 1024.88] Uh, okay.
[1024.88 → 1026.62] This side is white and this side is red.
[1026.70 → 1027.36] You're brave heart.
[1027.38 → 1027.84] Is it that bad?
[1027.92 → 1028.74] You're brave heart, dude.
[1028.74 → 1029.82] I have to wait for this to catch up.
[1030.02 → 1030.66] Oh, it's pretty bad.
[1030.66 → 1031.38] You're brave heart.
[1032.38 → 1032.74] Okay.
[1032.74 → 1033.36] What are you doing?
[1033.48 → 1034.30] I went to Twitch.
[1034.36 → 1035.58] I went to hang out with my friend, John.
[1036.18 → 1039.86] And at one point in time, he was like, let's go get lunch at the pier.
[1040.00 → 1041.68] Didn't realize how far away the pier was.
[1041.84 → 1044.20] So we walked for like a very long time.
[1044.22 → 1046.36] It's like pier, and they're like numbered or whatever, right?
[1046.50 → 1047.24] I don't know.
[1047.24 → 1047.76] Yeah, okay.
[1047.76 → 1047.94] Sure.
[1048.10 → 1049.62] And then had to walk all the way back.
[1049.90 → 1050.18] Trendy.
[1050.24 → 1051.36] In the sun the whole time.
[1051.38 → 1051.60] Yeah.
[1051.68 → 1054.02] While I'm carrying my like ridiculously heavy backpack.
[1054.08 → 1054.24] Yeah.
[1054.60 → 1055.78] I picked up on that.
[1055.96 → 1056.12] Yeah.
[1056.26 → 1056.44] Yeah.
[1056.86 → 1057.18] Yeah.
[1057.46 → 1058.86] That was a...
[1058.86 → 1060.14] It was an experience.
[1060.50 → 1061.62] So how's your trip?
[1062.06 → 1063.00] It was perfect.
[1063.10 → 1064.34] It was fun checking out Twitch.
[1064.46 → 1065.84] They are a crazy company.
[1067.40 → 1068.88] Be careful what you say.
[1069.56 → 1070.56] Need I remind you?
[1070.66 → 1072.36] What benevolent overlords...
[1072.36 → 1072.54] This.
[1073.00 → 1074.20] We are...
[1074.20 → 1074.64] Amazon.
[1074.86 → 1078.00] We are leaning on right now to broadcast this here stream.
[1078.26 → 1078.98] This might be interesting.
[1078.98 → 1080.06] Oh, Lord.
[1080.12 → 1080.92] It's Luke's mom.
[1081.04 → 1081.48] Oh, good.
[1081.92 → 1082.24] Hello?
[1082.44 → 1082.94] My favourite.
[1083.24 → 1083.64] Hi.
[1084.64 → 1085.04] Hi.
[1086.20 → 1089.58] How many times have I talked to you, Luke, about sunscreen?
[1089.90 → 1090.78] How many times?
[1090.88 → 1092.66] I didn't know how long the walk was going to be.
[1092.68 → 1094.36] Your mom's on my side for a change.
[1094.70 → 1100.76] You know, when we went to Mexico, Mom Cafetière, you know what happened?
[1100.76 → 1104.26] He didn't bring any sunscreen at all.
[1104.82 → 1110.18] He asked me to buy him a tube of sunscreen after he'd already been burned, which, by the
[1110.18 → 1112.64] way, is not how sunscreen works, as you well know.
[1113.14 → 1115.16] And then he didn't pay me back for it.
[1115.70 → 1117.74] Oh, my gosh.
[1117.74 → 1123.46] I didn't really remember the story that he said he didn't pay me back for it.
[1123.48 → 1124.42] And I was like, yeah, it's probably true.
[1125.88 → 1127.30] Oh, my gosh.
[1127.68 → 1131.40] Well, the good thing about this is, Linus, he is now your problem.
[1132.68 → 1134.02] Whoa, whoa, hold on.
[1136.14 → 1137.14] That's a big step.
[1137.48 → 1138.38] We just shook hands.
[1138.38 → 1140.68] What a transition.
[1140.98 → 1146.84] I'm not signing any documents taking legal custody of this guy.
[1147.06 → 1149.14] Getting adopted when you're in your, like, mid-20s.
[1149.54 → 1150.24] Heck yeah.
[1151.50 → 1151.82] All right.
[1151.90 → 1154.04] Any more burns, Linus, and it's on you.
[1156.92 → 1158.48] I can't.
[1159.60 → 1160.88] She just leaves.
[1161.90 → 1162.34] Wow.
[1163.12 → 1163.82] Hangs up.
[1163.82 → 1169.50] Even when I agree with your mom, she still finds a way to burn me.
[1170.34 → 1172.38] Even when we're on the same team.
[1172.46 → 1174.58] Maybe not as bad as I got burned.
[1174.62 → 1176.02] Yeah, not as bad as you got burned.
[1176.28 → 1177.70] But, yeah, it was a fun trip.
[1177.86 → 1183.06] They have, like, multiple five versus five gaming lounges in their studios.
[1183.08 → 1183.66] Of course they do.
[1183.70 → 1185.42] They have a bar.
[1185.72 → 1186.72] Of course they do.
[1186.82 → 1188.18] It's, like, open bar on Fridays.
[1188.42 → 1189.58] Of course they do.
[1189.58 → 1194.36] At least for the team that I was talking to, their, like, time policy, they have unlimited
[1194.36 → 1194.96] vacation.
[1195.24 → 1198.54] They show up anytime they want before lunch is served at Twitch.
[1198.62 → 1200.14] I don't know the exact time that is.
[1200.22 → 1202.38] It's not noon, but it's, like, whenever it's served at Twitch.
[1202.90 → 1203.88] And, yeah.
[1204.22 → 1205.92] So when am I getting your two weeks notice?
[1208.16 → 1208.52] No.
[1208.74 → 1208.90] No.
[1209.02 → 1209.88] I think I'm going to stay.
[1209.88 → 1210.44] I get a month?
[1211.46 → 1212.76] At least a month.
[1212.86 → 1213.00] Yeah.
[1213.24 → 1213.60] Yes.
[1213.72 → 1214.36] Well, that's okay.
[1214.36 → 1216.26] I can train up a new Luke in that time.
[1216.38 → 1217.22] No problem.
[1217.74 → 1218.98] No problem at all.
[1218.98 → 1219.66] Yeah.
[1219.94 → 1220.98] It was a fun trip, though.
[1221.10 → 1221.32] Yeah?
[1221.40 → 1221.62] It was good.
[1221.78 → 1221.94] Pretty cool?
[1222.10 → 1222.32] Okay.
[1224.64 → 1226.78] So let's move on to our first topic.
[1227.46 → 1231.28] This is actually, like, okay.
[1231.42 → 1231.92] A little spicy.
[1232.06 → 1233.62] So here's the thing.
[1233.70 → 1242.02] You know, you go hang around, you know, slash G or whatever, and you'll find plenty of hate
[1242.02 → 1250.12] for Intel and their business practices and their communications, and you'll find hate for anything Intel.
[1250.12 → 1264.58] But for the most part, for the last, you know, eight or so years, when they haven't really had a real competitor,
[1264.64 → 1273.78] Intel has put on a very good, and it's up to you, the individual viewer, to pick your next word.
[1273.78 → 1276.42] This is like a choose-your-own-adventure book, okay?
[1276.90 → 1287.52] You can decide whether it's having a pretty professional image or a pretty professional facade.
[1288.00 → 1288.78] It's up to you.
[1288.78 → 1289.80] I don't care.
[1289.96 → 1296.88] But for the most part, they've been fairly professional and fairly dignified in their corporate communications
[1296.88 → 1302.86] and their slide decks in their presentations to partners and to the press.
[1303.94 → 1309.08] So this was originally posted by Finn Humanist on the forum.
[1309.52 → 1309.78] Finn Humanist.
[1310.52 → 1311.64] I love that name.
[1311.78 → 1311.88] Wow.
[1311.88 → 1312.10] Hell yeah.
[1312.10 → 1316.12] Any Nordic names are just freaking awesome.
[1316.46 → 1317.06] Humanist.
[1317.28 → 1317.80] Nordic name.
[1317.80 → 1323.12] The operation cannot possibly go wrong is to have a name like Humanist.
[1323.94 → 1325.10] And the original article here-
[1325.10 → 1326.80] Oh, I thought it was literally just Humanist.
[1326.94 → 1327.56] Oh, no.
[1327.74 → 1329.56] I was like, I don't think that's a-
[1329.56 → 1330.30] Yeah, no.
[1330.38 → 1330.64] Okay.
[1330.90 → 1331.08] No.
[1331.08 → 1331.42] I got you.
[1332.12 → 1335.94] So Intel, this is just unbelievable.
[1335.94 → 1344.58] So posted by TechPowerUp here, in an official slide deck, posted the following, okay?
[1344.58 → 1354.06] First, there's some debate in the industry as to a couple of things.
[1354.14 → 1360.30] Number one, as to how exactly Intel is deriving these SMT numbers.
[1360.30 → 1366.84] So that's Intel's hyper-threading TM and AMD's, what are they calling it?
[1367.04 → 1367.84] I don't know.
[1367.84 → 1368.54] I can't remember.
[1368.64 → 1368.86] Whatever.
[1369.06 → 1370.08] Something else.
[1370.52 → 1371.56] But SMT, okay?
[1371.94 → 1372.72] So-
[1372.72 → 1374.50] Symmetrical multi-threading performance.
[1374.50 → 1374.94] Symmetric multi-threading, yeah.
[1374.94 → 1379.20] So where you take one core, and you feed it a couple of threads so it can process both
[1379.20 → 1382.30] of them more efficiently than if it had just processed one thread in the first place.
[1383.00 → 1383.30] Okay.
[1383.74 → 1386.32] So it's unclear a couple of things.
[1386.42 → 1390.54] Number one, how exactly they derive these numbers because they don't necessarily align
[1390.54 → 1393.80] with what all the sort of tech media are seeing.
[1393.80 → 1397.80] And number two, whether this is an applicable comparison in the first place.
[1397.80 → 1405.90] Because Intel has basically taken a Leon 6134, and they have run clock for clock against
[1405.90 → 1413.02] a Ry zen 7 desktop chip with the clear argument being that this is a close analog because these
[1413.02 → 1416.74] are both eight core, 16 thread processors running at 2.2 gigahertz.
[1416.74 → 1423.12] Now, to be clear, probably that comparison works fine.
[1423.12 → 1423.16] Yeah.
[1423.58 → 1429.48] Because contrary to what the people who got really confused by mine and Luke's discussion
[1429.48 → 1436.76] about Vega Frontier Edition, contrary to what those people think, architecturally, hardware-wise,
[1437.12 → 1437.88] Oh, yeah.
[1437.88 → 1444.12] the consumer-grade stuff is often not materially different from the enterprise-grade stuff.
[1444.66 → 1449.70] Sometimes you'll see better binning, a longer warranty, you'll see more functional units
[1449.70 → 1454.94] enabled, or you'll see some flags enabled for features that were turned off in order to
[1454.94 → 1456.42] artificially differentiate them.
[1456.50 → 1458.32] That's where most of the difference comes from.
[1458.86 → 1465.88] So fundamentally, Intel's comparison here may not actually be that far off hardware-wise,
[1466.18 → 1471.20] but that doesn't change that there are other questions here as well.
[1471.26 → 1472.02] What's the baseline?
[1473.28 → 1475.50] That's one thing I really hate about these graphs.
[1475.58 → 1476.30] Single thread.
[1476.30 → 1481.40] So that's the other thing you don't know, is single thread, I guess, so improvement
[1481.40 → 1485.06] over Intel single thread, improvement over AMD single thread, I guess.
[1485.08 → 1486.18] They don't say anywhere.
[1486.28 → 1488.40] Well, there's more information on slide 20 to 21.
[1488.62 → 1488.88] Okay.
[1488.96 → 1490.18] So that's fine.
[1490.38 → 1490.86] Honestly...
[1490.86 → 1493.00] The negative 13% is just like, what?
[1493.20 → 1494.06] That's not...
[1494.06 → 1498.92] Well, there are situations where hyper-threading as well does result in a performance loss.
[1499.00 → 1500.80] Right, but I don't think we've seen that on Ry zen.
[1500.96 → 1503.30] We haven't, but that specific workload that...
[1503.30 → 1505.96] Who knows how cherry-picked or not cherry-picked it is.
[1506.52 → 1509.56] Honestly, that's not the thing that bothered me that much.
[1509.60 → 1514.72] It's not that unusual, whether it's AMD, Intel, or NVIDIA, to include some basic performance
[1514.72 → 1518.76] comparisons when they're trying to make their product look good in a slide deck.
[1518.76 → 1522.98] This one is one of the ones that blew me away.
[1523.98 → 1533.60] Where Intel basically gave themselves a checkmark for robust ecosystem, decades of investment
[1533.60 → 1537.46] in software optimizations and validation, easier application deployment for customers,
[1537.46 → 1540.46] and some of the stuff on here is just like...
[1540.46 → 1541.46] Um...
[1543.76 → 1544.40] Okay.
[1544.68 → 1545.58] Hold on a second.
[1546.92 → 1548.36] Like, hold on.
[1548.66 → 1548.80] What?
[1549.28 → 1549.64] Okay.
[1549.80 → 1550.46] So, yeah...
[1551.50 → 1552.10] Hold on.
[1552.14 → 1552.52] Hold on.
[1552.78 → 1553.00] Okay.
[1553.02 → 1555.00] I'm trying to find something just totally stupid.
[1555.18 → 1557.54] There were a couple that were really dumb.
[1557.96 → 1558.46] Like, we're...
[1558.46 → 1560.02] Gigabyte's on here somewhere.
[1560.02 → 1563.70] Like, what...
[1563.70 → 1570.38] What software optimization are you doing with Gigabyte on your new server chip that AMD
[1570.38 → 1571.44] doesn't...
[1571.44 → 1571.86] Here it is.
[1572.02 → 1572.50] So, here's...
[1572.50 → 1574.08] Here's, like, Gigabyte on here.
[1574.52 → 1575.76] Because frickin'...
[1575.76 → 1576.42] Or something.
[1576.76 → 1582.58] So, then AMD doesn't get Gigabyte on their list of partners.
[1582.98 → 1583.42] Right?
[1584.18 → 1585.36] Not even Gigabyte.
[1585.38 → 1586.00] Literally none.
[1586.14 → 1588.10] Who I'm pretty sure that AMD works with.
[1588.38 → 1588.90] Question mark.
[1588.98 → 1589.88] We didn't look into it.
[1589.88 → 1591.42] Not even Supermicro.
[1591.70 → 1592.02] Okay?
[1592.14 → 1599.50] Who I'm pretty sure that AMD is working with on their Naples product.
[1599.94 → 1603.50] And by pretty sure, I mean you can bet on that.
[1604.98 → 1606.48] And the list goes on and on.
[1606.58 → 1609.18] I'm sure AMD has talked to Microsoft.
[1610.30 → 1610.62] Okay?
[1610.92 → 1613.94] I'm pretty sure that conversation is going on right now.
[1613.94 → 1615.94] So, they basically go...
[1615.94 → 1619.86] They take this quote totally out of context.
[1619.88 → 1624.54] Expect software optimizations needed for Naples just like Ry zen.
[1625.08 → 1625.90] Which is fair.
[1626.46 → 1633.42] But what Intel ignores is that when they launch a new architecture, software optimizations are needed.
[1633.42 → 1636.92] It is not even newsworthy.
[1637.04 → 1639.22] Whether it's Intel or AMD.
[1639.22 → 1643.22] For there to be an erratum, I believe is the singular of erratic.
[1643.80 → 1644.20] Oh, okay.
[1644.28 → 1644.62] Erratum.
[1644.72 → 1644.98] Okay.
[1645.12 → 1654.22] So, some kind of weird bug where the CPU needs to be updated microcode and needs maybe even a driver fix in order to fix some kind of weird hardware bug.
[1654.22 → 1656.52] That stuff happens to both of them.
[1657.20 → 1661.80] And basically, they've turned that into AMD's Ry zen CPU gaming performance.
[1661.88 → 1662.16] Oh, yeah.
[1662.26 → 1662.38] Okay.
[1662.50 → 1665.42] So, they took another quote totally out of context.
[1666.04 → 1669.24] Ry zen CPU gaming performance inhibited by lack of optimization.
[1669.24 → 1675.14] So, they're basically saying, look, software not optimized for their four-die per socket implementation.
[1675.60 → 1679.44] Likely a multi-year investment effort to develop, optimize, and validate an ecosystem.
[1679.44 → 1691.84] That is taking a nugget of truth and blowing it up into a movie theatre room filled with popcorn.
[1693.84 → 1695.78] And a nugget is not even a kernel.
[1696.30 → 1697.68] That's how far off we are.
[1697.94 → 1698.78] Random little tidbit.
[1698.86 → 1701.56] I can't verify this because I can't find them.
[1701.68 → 1703.48] But apparently, there's two Hitachi's.
[1703.88 → 1705.32] Hitachi's just listed twice.
[1705.78 → 1706.54] Oh, seriously?
[1706.58 → 1707.68] Which is just kind of funny.
[1707.78 → 1708.48] Here's Hitachi.
[1708.80 → 1709.18] Hold on.
[1709.18 → 1709.64] Here we go.
[1709.66 → 1709.84] Okay.
[1709.88 → 1710.40] Where's the other one?
[1710.40 → 1712.22] So, here's a Hitachi and here's a Hitachi.
[1712.22 → 1712.90] Oh, there you go.
[1713.02 → 1713.12] Yeah.
[1713.18 → 1716.18] So, Intel works with Hitachi so much that they...
[1717.00 → 1718.68] Hitachi while they Hitachi.
[1718.84 → 1720.36] So, they can Hitachi while they Hitachi.
[1721.28 → 1721.96] Yo, dog.
[1722.14 → 1724.00] They're that hardcore on Hitachi.
[1724.22 → 1728.94] I mean, for all I know, there are multiples that are in there twice because I don't think anyone looked that closely at this slide.
[1729.08 → 1729.26] No.
[1729.40 → 1731.14] I don't think legal looked at this slide.
[1731.20 → 1734.38] Or maybe they did, but they were just like, yeah, I don't really understand.
[1734.40 → 1734.72] Oh, no, no, no.
[1734.72 → 1736.34] I thought IBM was in there twice, but no.
[1736.46 → 1736.70] Yeah.
[1736.76 → 1737.12] All right.
[1737.52 → 1737.86] Okay.
[1737.86 → 1742.64] And you know what's the craziest part is that that's not even where this ends.
[1742.78 → 1743.02] No.
[1743.32 → 1745.12] That's not even the super hardcore part.
[1745.14 → 1745.82] This isn't...
[1745.82 → 1746.00] No.
[1746.00 → 1746.54] In my opinion.
[1746.78 → 1747.06] No.
[1747.20 → 1747.32] No.
[1747.32 → 1748.22] This gets worse.
[1748.52 → 1750.04] And once again...
[1750.04 → 1753.44] In these black and white terms, okay?
[1753.44 → 1753.48] Okay?
[1757.60 → 1758.00] Intel.
[1758.00 → 1759.44] Yes, yes, yes.
[1760.44 → 1762.18] No, no, no, no, no, no.
[1762.70 → 1763.42] This is like...
[1763.42 → 1765.46] You know when you go to one of those, like...
[1765.46 → 1769.48] It's usually slightly ghetto websites, and they'll be like, this is our product.
[1769.60 → 1770.26] A bunch of check marks.
[1770.26 → 1773.26] Usually it's for like a video ripping software.
[1773.38 → 1773.68] Yeah.
[1773.78 → 1773.90] Right?
[1774.22 → 1775.04] This is their product.
[1775.18 → 1776.16] No check marks.
[1776.34 → 1777.16] They suck.
[1777.42 → 1780.96] And sometimes it's on nicer stuff, but usually it's a little bit more granular, and they'll
[1780.96 → 1785.08] actually show like, yeah, their software does this thing, but we do more of these things
[1785.08 → 1785.44] or whatever.
[1785.80 → 1787.38] But usually it's some junkie.
[1787.38 → 1788.82] It's a dignified way to do it.
[1788.88 → 1789.02] Yeah.
[1789.06 → 1797.02] Whereas like, the Jacky software way is like, has three red pixels in the bottom corner.
[1797.60 → 1798.02] Yes.
[1798.74 → 1799.14] Doesn't.
[1799.40 → 1799.76] Doesn't.
[1800.78 → 1801.82] So, here we...
[1801.82 → 1803.10] So, let's go...
[1803.10 → 1803.82] Let's go...
[1803.82 → 1804.80] Let's go back to this.
[1805.38 → 1807.92] And I'm taking this out of here, because we've got to look at this slide.
[1808.68 → 1811.76] Proven system performance and innovation.
[1811.76 → 1818.48] Inconsistent performance from four glued together desktop dies.
[1818.86 → 1828.72] Do I detect that Intel is neither blue nor red, but perhaps a little green right now about
[1828.72 → 1829.84] Infinity Fabric?
[1830.56 → 1831.00] Wow.
[1831.34 → 1833.00] Because it's not glued together.
[1833.00 → 1843.02] And, and, do I detect some nearly decade old salt right now from back when AMD was crapping
[1843.02 → 1853.64] on Intel for gluing together single core processors, which, by the way, Intel was super doing back
[1853.64 → 1861.56] when they released the Pentium D series, compared to AMD's architected dual-core design.
[1861.56 → 1863.92] Do I detect some salt here?
[1864.12 → 1877.54] Because a modular core design is not the same thing as taking your single core product and slapping two dies onto a package.
[1879.74 → 1880.38] Okay.
[1880.76 → 1881.54] Let's carry on.
[1881.62 → 1882.16] Next point.
[1882.68 → 1888.54] Architected for the data centre, which has nothing to do with inconsistent supply.
[1888.90 → 1889.46] Nothing at all.
[1889.70 → 1891.02] And, and poor track record.
[1891.02 → 1896.30] Now you can go after AMD for having a bit of a poor track record over the last little while.
[1896.48 → 1896.60] Sure.
[1896.98 → 1901.60] I don't think that AMD's supply for Operon has been the problem.
[1901.70 → 1903.90] I just don't think anyone's wanted it for a while.
[1904.14 → 1911.48] So basically Intel is taking irrelevant, unrelated points and saying, and we're architected for
[1911.48 → 1914.18] the data centre, which has nothing to do with those other things we said.
[1914.18 → 1919.30] Also, Naples is super architected for the data centre.
[1919.64 → 1920.20] Okay.
[1920.54 → 1924.62] AMD Epic may have a silly gamers name and it does.
[1924.86 → 1925.02] Yeah.
[1925.02 → 1935.76] But that changes nothing about the way that Infinity Fabric and the way that they built this architecture for Mono PCI Express lanes,
[1935.76 → 1939.54] which is super a big deal for the data centre right now.
[1939.54 → 1940.26] It absolutely is.
[1940.26 → 1952.54] That has nothing to do with the way that this product was designed for massive amounts of memory and massive numbers of connected devices via PCI Express.
[1953.58 → 1954.06] Okay.
[1954.58 → 1955.36] Carrying on.
[1956.24 → 1958.10] Robust software and hardware.
[1958.10 → 1960.32] We're going after that again.
[1960.50 → 1961.68] We're going after the ecosystem.
[1961.88 → 1962.20] Exactly.
[1962.30 → 1963.58] Lack of ecosystem.
[1964.04 → 1965.40] They have no ecosystem.
[1965.58 → 1966.00] None at all.
[1966.22 → 1966.84] None at all.
[1966.84 → 1967.12] It doesn't exist.
[1967.36 → 1968.40] You can't, you can buy the chip.
[1968.46 → 1969.30] You can't put it in anything.
[1969.70 → 1970.10] And you know.
[1970.10 → 1970.98] There's no software for it.
[1971.00 → 1972.34] There's no compatible hardware for it.
[1972.34 → 1977.40] Here's the problem with this hard sales pitch in this deck right now.
[1977.52 → 1982.68] If Intel had come out and said, look, we've got a more mature ecosystem.
[1983.02 → 1984.52] That's way more reasonable.
[1984.52 → 1993.38] We've been supporting the data centre for the last five years in a way that AMD has just been completely out of the game for.
[1993.96 → 2001.60] We understand our customers better than AMD coming in as practically an outsider is in a position to do right now.
[2001.66 → 2002.48] You know what the weird thing is?
[2002.50 → 2003.84] I'd have gone, okay.
[2004.12 → 2008.90] The people who hate Intel are going to hate this because they can find something to hate in anything that Intel does.
[2009.04 → 2010.44] But I can accept that.
[2010.60 → 2012.88] This slide, I cannot accept.
[2012.88 → 2016.58] This slide specifically feels like some person.
[2016.86 → 2021.24] You know how every once in a while you'll see like Intel slides, and it's obviously not a real Intel slide.
[2021.42 → 2024.84] It feels like some random dude on YouTube was like, I have memes.
[2025.40 → 2026.76] Intel is attacking AMD.
[2027.08 → 2029.38] And just like threw this slide together in five minutes.
[2029.74 → 2030.70] This is dank memes.
[2030.70 → 2031.24] Like it's actually.
[2031.58 → 2032.54] This is dank memes level.
[2032.78 → 2032.98] Yeah.
[2033.64 → 2036.18] And the show is not even over.
[2036.68 → 2038.34] Like the show is not over.
[2039.04 → 2041.26] There's, but wait, there's more.
[2041.26 → 2044.42] Oh, look at these.
[2044.48 → 2045.70] Look at these arrows.
[2046.38 → 2052.50] This is like a lesson in how to not do PowerPoint.
[2052.94 → 2055.50] It's like the clickbait version of business marketing.
[2055.76 → 2056.32] Right?
[2057.10 → 2058.58] Fully integrated.
[2058.68 → 2059.60] All capital letters.
[2059.80 → 2060.38] Big arrow.
[2060.54 → 2060.80] Yeah.
[2060.80 → 2062.44] Here's Leon's.
[2062.52 → 2063.68] Oh, oh, by the way.
[2063.86 → 2064.86] Hold on a second.
[2064.96 → 2065.14] Okay.
[2065.22 → 2065.36] Yeah.
[2065.42 → 2068.10] Here's the way that all the cache communicates.
[2068.10 → 2073.32] And we're just kind of ignoring right now the way that all these cores are interconnected.
[2073.32 → 2076.00] Because in some.
[2076.54 → 2077.34] Okay.
[2077.54 → 2082.40] Now I'm not the Uber architect, surely.
[2082.88 → 2083.32] You know.
[2083.62 → 2084.76] Yes, I understand.
[2085.18 → 2089.52] I'm intentionally speaking in a non-grammatically correct fashion right now.
[2089.52 → 2095.92] Because CPU, low level CPU architecture is not a strong point for me.
[2096.04 → 2102.02] I do lean on more technical people like Dr. Sutras over at Nantes to explain this stuff to me sometimes.
[2102.02 → 2120.44] But to represent your CPU architecture as fully integrated as though there aren't internal interconnects and internal bottlenecks on a many core Intel Leon is not a fair representation of exactly how that works.
[2120.82 → 2124.32] And they're saying here, single die implementation maximizes performance.
[2124.48 → 2130.28] And in some cases that may affect performance positively compared to AMD's approach.
[2130.28 → 2135.98] But to call AMD's approach, which by the way, these coherent links matter.
[2136.36 → 2139.64] And the way that every set of Zen cores.
[2139.76 → 2141.46] So there's eight per module here.
[2141.58 → 2147.26] The way that every set of Zen cores has a coherent link against every single other one.
[2147.44 → 2147.66] Yeah.
[2147.78 → 2149.34] Freaking matters.
[2149.68 → 2151.04] Notice the cross-links in the middle.
[2151.52 → 2152.54] That matters.
[2155.24 → 2157.70] And they drop the glued together again.
[2157.70 → 2163.26] Glued together is not a fair representation of what AMD's doing over there.
[2167.02 → 2167.70] Unbelievable.
[2168.26 → 2168.60] Rough.
[2170.50 → 2174.06] So it kind of actually goes on and on.
[2174.16 → 2176.48] But I feel like we've spent a long time on this topic.
[2176.48 → 2183.70] And the point is, this is beneath Intel.
[2184.56 → 2191.20] This is not an appropriate, dignified way for them to respond.
[2192.22 → 2197.44] They don't have to, like, even if, like, we've seen this before.
[2197.44 → 2207.92] It's not like AMD has never blind sided Intel with an architecturally and price-to-performance superior product.
[2209.16 → 2216.14] Athlon 64 and first-generation Operon came in and kicked ass.
[2216.34 → 2219.00] In a way that Zen actually doesn't.
[2219.68 → 2221.08] Like, Zen is competitive.
[2221.08 → 2224.58] Not as crazy as, like, yeah.
[2224.72 → 2232.28] Yeah, but it's not like AMD came out of absolutely nowhere and took the performance crown.
[2232.28 → 2243.60] And even when AMD had the performance crown, it took a long time outside the enthusiast space.
[2244.36 → 2249.30] And actually, I mean, on server it kind of went better than on the desktop.
[2249.30 → 2265.56] But it took a long time for AMD to claw back significant enough market share that Intel couldn't launch Core 2 Duo and basically crap all over everything AMD had achieved in a very short period of time.
[2265.66 → 2267.16] From a business standpoint.
[2267.52 → 2272.58] Not from an industry disruption and moving all of us forward standpoint.
[2272.76 → 2275.38] I mean, they brought a 64-bit on the desktop.
[2275.38 → 2286.82] So the fact that Intel is reacting in this knee-jerk, undignified fashion, it doesn't make business sense.
[2286.96 → 2289.52] It doesn't make company image sense.
[2289.68 → 2291.92] It might not even make legal sense.
[2292.26 → 2293.66] Yeah, that's a little rough.
[2293.82 → 2297.12] The glued-together part is, like, specifically an issue.
[2298.10 → 2302.44] So, basically, come on, guys.
[2302.44 → 2302.74] Sup?
[2305.74 → 2306.58] About that time?
[2307.06 → 2307.24] Oh.
[2307.50 → 2308.20] Oh, yeah.
[2308.56 → 2308.80] Right.
[2309.78 → 2313.10] Speaking of sup, you know what's sup?
[2314.06 → 2314.50] Uh.
[2315.46 → 2316.02] Oh.
[2316.28 → 2316.98] Oh, cool.
[2317.34 → 2319.78] We haven't done a Comic Bento spot in a long time.
[2319.96 → 2320.48] Yeah, we have.
[2321.20 → 2322.04] Oh, you did one.
[2322.30 → 2322.56] Correct.
[2322.82 → 2323.02] Oh.
[2323.22 → 2323.90] All right.
[2323.96 → 2324.40] Well, whatever.
[2324.46 → 2325.28] It'll be fun for me.
[2325.40 → 2325.54] Yeah.
[2325.54 → 2333.56] So, Comic Bento is your original comic book subscription box with at least a $50 value in
[2333.56 → 2334.14] each box.
[2334.66 → 2341.20] Every box comes with four to five graphic novels, and it's $25 a month or less, depending
[2341.20 → 2342.40] on your planned selection.
[2342.72 → 2347.94] There are monthly themes, and this one is old school.
[2348.62 → 2349.26] This is pretty cool.
[2349.38 → 2351.26] There's Avengers 4.
[2351.46 → 2352.18] I'm not going to go into, like...
[2352.18 → 2353.86] Are you ruining what I'm about to unbox?
[2354.18 → 2355.36] Did you just do...
[2355.36 → 2357.62] Did you just do what I thought you did?
[2357.72 → 2361.06] There's no Avengers definitely, uh, greater than or less than.
[2361.06 → 2361.56] And it's right.
[2361.72 → 2362.50] It's the top one.
[2362.64 → 2364.84] It's the top one on the box.
[2365.56 → 2366.64] Of course it is.
[2367.50 → 2371.22] That's okay, because that means you can't spoil that much of the surprise for me.
[2371.34 → 2371.54] Yeah.
[2372.00 → 2372.24] Yeah.
[2372.64 → 2373.98] That would have been pretty obvious.
[2373.98 → 2380.84] It comes with a cardboard backing, so your precious graphic novels will not be, uh, bent unnecessarily.
[2382.18 → 2383.30] All right, cool.
[2384.80 → 2388.20] A classic feeling team updated for a modern reading experience.
[2388.42 → 2390.08] Wow, these are actually really nicely printed, too.
[2390.08 → 2390.24] Yeah.
[2391.14 → 2391.84] They often are.
[2392.56 → 2392.96] Cool.
[2393.00 → 2393.76] What else we got in here?
[2394.14 → 2395.40] Captain Victory!
[2396.18 → 2397.36] I have to confess.
[2397.44 → 2397.98] Kirby Genesis.
[2397.98 → 2400.66] I am freaking not familiar with Captain Victory.
[2401.36 → 2402.06] Neither am I.
[2402.76 → 2403.28] Very cool.
[2404.10 → 2405.64] Next up, we've got Sovereign.
[2406.80 → 2412.36] One thing that I do like about these is they often try to come in with one that you recognize.
[2412.62 → 2412.92] Right.
[2412.92 → 2416.98] And then filter in some other ones that look super cool, but you might not know about.
[2417.22 → 2417.34] Right.
[2417.48 → 2419.10] Unless you're, like, a super hardcore comic fan.
[2419.22 → 2426.02] And that you'll, you'd never, like, I mean, okay, perfect example of, uh, sort of getting drawn into something that might not have a great cover.
[2426.12 → 2427.38] This has a great cover, though.
[2427.90 → 2429.52] Cinderella Serial Killer Princess.
[2429.72 → 2431.78] How can I, like, I'm going to read this after the show.
[2432.06 → 2432.38] Apparently.
[2432.64 → 2433.10] That'll be great.
[2433.10 → 2438.82] It says, for the Cinderella one specifically, I was reading this, uh, Serial Killer Princess, critically acclaimed reinvention of Cinderella.
[2439.12 → 2446.32] This book is for fans of Deadpool and Harley Quinn-issue comics, which if you look at the front and the art style with, like, her heel and stuff, that totally makes sense.
[2446.96 → 2448.10] Uh, DA-da-da-da-da-da.
[2448.20 → 2450.88] And takes revenge violence to a whole new level.
[2451.30 → 2451.54] Fun.
[2452.22 → 2457.92] So, a perfect example of this is that I was stuck with absolutely nothing to do at my uncle's house.
[2457.92 → 2464.90] And the only thing on his shelf that wasn't, like, Russian poetry or something was Bone.
[2465.52 → 2466.36] Are you familiar with Bone?
[2466.50 → 2466.72] No.
[2466.94 → 2468.28] Oh, okay, yeah, it's a graphic novel.
[2468.58 → 2470.18] It's, like, this thick for all of them.
[2470.20 → 2471.40] You should borrow it sometime, because it's great.
[2471.62 → 2471.78] Sure.
[2471.94 → 2475.38] Uh, it's something that I wouldn't have looked at unless somebody put it in front of me and said,
[2475.38 → 2480.26] Well, you have nothing else to do right now, so you're going to have to read this or do nothing.
[2480.52 → 2484.36] Or, if I paid for it already, so damn it, I better try it.
[2484.48 → 2484.78] Yes.
[2485.06 → 2485.20] Yeah.
[2485.20 → 2493.70] Um, so cool, so you can sign up using code LTT to get seven bucks off Comic Bento today over at ComicBento.com.
[2493.86 → 2494.10] Okay.
[2494.68 → 2499.80] Also sponsoring the show today is FreshBooks slash LTX.
[2499.80 → 2504.98] So, if you're a small business owner or a freelancer, and you're looking for a super simple accounting tool,
[2505.56 → 2507.32] FreshBooks has got you covered.
[2507.76 → 2511.70] And, like, honestly, I could go on and on about it forever.
[2511.70 → 2518.02] There's the fact that you can, uh, it's all cloud-based, so you can do it on your desktop or your laptop,
[2518.02 → 2521.32] or you can have the full functionality of FreshBooks on your mobile device.
[2521.40 → 2522.38] You can track your expenses.
[2522.76 → 2523.94] You can bill your clients.
[2524.04 → 2525.74] You can see when they've seen your invoices.
[2526.44 → 2527.62] Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[2527.62 → 2537.42] But the point is, if you want to save time and make more money by doing work instead of documenting your work and billing for your work,
[2537.86 → 2539.20] FreshBooks is the way to go.
[2539.44 → 2546.44] And they have graciously agreed to sponsor LTX 2017, which is coming up very soon.
[2546.52 → 2547.52] July 29th.
[2547.74 → 2553.90] Uh, we've got literally a trailer load worth of swag over in the, uh, other way.
[2553.90 → 2554.86] Have you seen the swag pile?
[2555.06 → 2555.32] No.
[2555.32 → 2556.48] It's, it's freaking sick.
[2556.68 → 2557.36] Can I steal some?
[2557.96 → 2564.20] Uh, you can, you can do whatever is required at the show to get swag just like everybody else.
[2564.26 → 2565.56] That's actually way more interesting.
[2565.86 → 2566.90] And I'm totally down.
[2567.14 → 2568.30] We've got swag.
[2568.44 → 2569.36] We've got activities.
[2569.64 → 2573.66] We are going to have some very, very special builds there.
[2573.80 → 2581.12] So the plan, the plan is to have the arcade build there.
[2581.64 → 2582.12] Yeah.
[2582.20 → 2584.02] The ultimate DIY arcade.
[2584.22 → 2584.38] Yeah.
[2584.38 → 2587.92] The plan is to resurrect mineral oil PC.
[2588.20 → 2588.40] Yeah.
[2588.70 → 2593.64] The plan is to have a one of a kind wall pewter there.
[2594.04 → 2595.24] You know about that project?
[2595.36 → 2595.88] No, actually.
[2596.10 → 2596.96] Uh, yes, yes, yes.
[2596.96 → 2600.32] And there is a really special project.
[2600.50 → 2601.00] I'm so sure.
[2601.00 → 2609.98] All I'm going to say is it involves about 200 pounds worth of monitors and monitor mounting
[2609.98 → 2610.40] hardware.
[2612.40 → 2614.76] It's like genuinely really, really cool.
[2614.84 → 2615.56] And it'll be there.
[2615.78 → 2616.56] And you will see it in person.
[2616.56 → 2618.52] It's cooler than the one that I saw down in Silicon Valley.
[2618.78 → 2619.20] Cool.
[2619.20 → 2620.18] Like straight up.
[2620.18 → 2622.86] Um, so try out FreshBooks.
[2623.06 → 2627.30] Head to freshbooks.com slash when and enter when in how did you hear about us section.
[2627.40 → 2628.54] They got a free trial there.
[2628.54 → 2631.58] And finally, fixity.
[2631.58 → 2637.66] If you're familiar with fixity, and you probably are if you've ever tried to replace a battery
[2637.66 → 2646.66] in a sealed device or replaced a screen or upgraded an iMac because those things are actually not
[2646.66 → 2652.04] easy to open up unless you've got all the equipment you need from fixity.
[2652.10 → 2658.32] So they've got professional guides, and they've also got a fantastic lineup of great high quality
[2658.32 → 2658.78] tools.
[2658.98 → 2664.36] And this one right here, the Protect tool kit is now only $59.95.
[2664.36 → 2668.78] It includes the 64-bit driver kit with all the bits that you need for just about any
[2668.78 → 2670.10] DIY electronics repair.
[2670.32 → 2672.60] It's got an anti-static strap.
[2672.72 → 2674.04] It's got their suction cups.
[2674.14 → 2675.42] It's got their prying tools.
[2675.54 → 2677.90] It's got their ESD-safe tweezers.
[2678.46 → 2681.84] And, oh yeah, I've already spoiled the punchline.
[2681.90 → 2683.42] It's only $59.99 now.
[2683.66 → 2687.68] So head over to iFixit.com slash Linus and pick up yours.
[2688.00 → 2692.14] You can often buy yourself an fixity tech tool kit.
[2692.14 → 2699.22] And for an hour or two of your time, you can basically have your tool kit covered with the
[2699.22 → 2702.40] money that you would have spent paying somebody else to do a very basic repair.
[2702.52 → 2706.48] Honestly, one of my favourite things about it is before this, I had like a few different
[2706.48 → 2707.06] screwdrivers.
[2707.48 → 2707.66] Yep.
[2707.96 → 2711.96] And like they did, different screwdrivers would have different size bits with them and stuff.
[2712.10 → 2713.22] And now I just grab one thing.
[2713.26 → 2715.92] And you'd always be running around looking for that one.
[2715.92 → 2716.28] Yeah.
[2716.90 → 2717.64] All right.
[2717.78 → 2721.00] So this was posted originally by Valentine on the forum.
[2721.26 → 2723.80] And Nontech is the original article here.
[2723.96 → 2730.20] We've got a lot more details about Thread ripper as well as Ry zen 3.
[2730.20 → 2736.70] So the Thread ripper 1920X and 1950X are going to be 12 and 16 core processors.
[2736.86 → 2737.78] They are freaking huge.
[2737.86 → 2739.44] That is a real human hand for scale.
[2740.06 → 2742.56] And they're going to cost $799 and $999.
[2743.76 → 2748.24] AMD has basically come right in and said, nope.
[2748.54 → 2750.10] This stuff doesn't cost that much.
[2750.10 → 2759.16] .png, the pricing for, wow, Skylike X is now looking a little bit out of whack.
[2759.86 → 2764.92] I mean, it remains to be seen exactly how well they perform, but we know clock speeds.
[2765.34 → 2772.80] The 1950X will apparently have a base clock of 3.4 gigahertz and a boost of 4 gigahertz.
[2773.00 → 2773.36] Wow.
[2774.34 → 2777.20] That is not freaking bad.
[2777.30 → 2778.38] On that many threads.
[2778.38 → 2781.40] It's got a TDP of 180 watts.
[2781.58 → 2782.52] That's fun, though.
[2782.58 → 2790.66] But if Ry zen is anything to go by, it looks like we might get a proper TIM, so a proper
[2790.66 → 2794.18] thermal interface material, which will help to dissipate that heat.
[2794.54 → 2801.00] And because it is such a large, I don't want to say chip because that doesn't matter.
[2801.08 → 2807.16] Because the overall dye area under the spreader is so large, we're going to see coolers that
[2807.16 → 2812.54] are optimized to have heat pipes across as many of those processing cores as possible, and
[2812.54 → 2815.40] it should be potentially easier to manage.
[2815.86 → 2822.80] Also, assuming that AMD doesn't rush the ecosystem too much, hopefully we won't run into any problems
[2822.80 → 2825.42] with the boards, but all of that remains to be seen.
[2825.42 → 2835.94] And, you know, combined with Intel's woes on X299 right now is further validation for all
[2835.94 → 2843.14] the people criticizing me for moving our editors over to X99 shortly before the X299 launch.
[2843.14 → 2843.44] Yeah.
[2843.70 → 2844.94] That's why I do it.
[2845.06 → 2845.20] Yeah.
[2845.20 → 2849.14] Because in much, like, and it has nothing to do with BIOS.
[2849.52 → 2852.04] It's not AMD, Intel, NVIDIA.
[2852.28 → 2853.52] I don't give a crap.
[2853.80 → 2858.26] If it's mission-critical, I am not running the latest.
[2858.26 → 2861.06] You go one gen old, then you have all the BIOS updates, you have tons of different chip
[2861.06 → 2862.40] set updates, you have so much different.
[2862.40 → 2868.74] And I might run it if it's one machine, but I'm not going to go and invest an entire workstation
[2868.74 → 2875.74] change out in something that maybe it's good, or maybe I'm going to find out that that board
[2875.74 → 2880.20] that I put in there has some silly bug and needs to be recalled or whatever.
[2880.82 → 2885.38] When that would be thoroughly covered on forums everywhere by that time if you're buying a
[2885.38 → 2885.90] year old board.
[2885.98 → 2886.30] That's right.
[2886.30 → 2890.96] I can just buy something that's based on, that's like the same, basically the same board
[2890.96 → 2894.06] is what we've been running on our test benches for the last, you know, year and a half.
[2894.22 → 2899.46] Speaking of things you can do with this though, are you going to go back to X gamers one CPU?
[2900.74 → 2903.22] Um, not with Thread ripper, probably.
[2903.46 → 2903.72] Okay.
[2903.92 → 2906.58] Uh, but if we can get something going with Epic.
[2907.18 → 2907.54] Okay.
[2907.76 → 2911.26] I would love to do something very interesting with Epic.
[2911.38 → 2914.16] And you can even be like genuinely one this time.
[2914.90 → 2915.70] Actually, yeah.
[2916.32 → 2916.76] Yeah.
[2916.92 → 2917.60] Yeah, we could.
[2917.60 → 2922.26] Because a lot of people roasted Linus because it had two CPUs in it.
[2922.52 → 2926.18] It was supposed to be a play on two girls, one cup.
[2926.24 → 2927.32] I know what it was supposed to be.
[2927.52 → 2930.74] But I'm saying, either way, I don't really mind it that much.
[2930.86 → 2931.70] Gamers, girls.
[2931.96 → 2932.86] I thought the joke was funny.
[2933.26 → 2934.42] I thought the joke was funny.
[2934.46 → 2934.94] Everything's cool.
[2935.04 → 2937.06] I'm just saying you could actually do it this time.
[2937.12 → 2938.46] He is kind of a suck up, isn't he?
[2938.66 → 2939.30] John was right.
[2939.72 → 2940.24] Get out of here.
[2940.30 → 2940.82] I don't even care.
[2941.22 → 2942.14] I don't want you here anymore.
[2942.16 → 2942.60] What is going on here?
[2942.60 → 2943.78] I'm hosting the show by myself.
[2943.86 → 2944.94] I'm still in the frame.
[2945.38 → 2947.68] I can just talk louder for days.
[2947.90 → 2948.26] Ow.
[2949.88 → 2950.38] All right.
[2950.44 → 2951.20] Next topic.
[2952.72 → 2954.24] Skylike X mess explored.
[2954.38 → 2957.40] I guess it's my turn to throw it in.
[2957.78 → 2958.40] Oh, Geez.
[2959.00 → 2960.34] That's kind of a rough day, hey?
[2960.34 → 2964.18] So far, Skylike X has been plagued by two main issues.
[2964.54 → 2966.82] At its stock settings, it can barely be cooled.
[2967.36 → 2968.56] Oh, your thing's in the way.
[2968.70 → 2969.08] Oh, no.
[2969.48 → 2969.80] Sorry.
[2969.98 → 2975.20] But during normal operation, this is due to its power consumption being extremely high in some situations.
[2975.60 → 2977.90] We also found that the...
[2979.90 → 2982.00] There's a huge cooling issue with the board.
[2982.24 → 2982.94] Oh, yeah, VRMs.
[2983.04 → 2983.44] Arms.
[2983.50 → 2985.06] Yeah, the VRMs had a huge cooling issue.
[2985.32 → 2986.42] That was a couple of weeks ago.
[2986.64 → 2986.84] Yeah.
[2986.84 → 2990.08] There's barely any room for enthusiasts to overclock.
[2990.28 → 2998.04] Also, many motherboards limit Skylike X CPUs further due to poor design choices, like I just mentioned, such as insufficient VRM cooling.
[2998.54 → 3007.22] So this may be the dawn of the motherboard full cover block.
[3008.24 → 3008.84] Oh, hey.
[3009.06 → 3010.88] So that's been a thing.
[3011.00 → 3011.30] Yeah.
[3011.30 → 3013.30] But it's never really made sense because...
[3013.82 → 3022.96] So going back to the early 2000s, it was pretty commonplace for motherboards to have little whiny, annoying fans on them.
[3023.14 → 3023.24] Yeah.
[3023.24 → 3027.76] And then right around the time of, like, I guess, Enforce...
[3027.76 → 3032.06] Enforce 3 or Enforce 4.
[3032.36 → 3034.86] What was the A8N32 SLI Deluxe?
[3036.66 → 3037.74] SLI Deluxe.
[3037.98 → 3039.72] I can't remember what chipset that was.
[3039.80 → 3040.80] I want to say Enforce 4.
[3040.80 → 3041.44] Okay.
[3042.62 → 3045.80] So that's an A8N32 SLI Deluxe.
[3045.88 → 3046.34] Terrible image.
[3046.40 → 3047.02] But you get the point.
[3047.18 → 3058.06] So we did away with noisy North Bridge and especially South Bridge coolers because they have to keep it low profile because you can install cards here, right?
[3058.18 → 3059.64] The SLI existed at the time.
[3059.64 → 3063.36] And we did away with that, and we moved towards this.
[3063.90 → 3083.52] Heat pipes that lie flat on the board and carry all the heat up around the CPU socket area with the assumption that either you're going to have an air cooler sitting on your CPU that's going to generate enough passive airflow to deal with the VRMs here and here as well as the heat from the South Bridge and the North Bridge which end up here.
[3084.28 → 3088.20] So that paradigm has lasted us pretty much until now.
[3088.20 → 3095.44] Now, we might be returning to active cooling on VRMs if there's no other way to deal with this.
[3096.18 → 3105.42] And honestly, what this kind of looks like to me is like Intel has said that like, hey, that we have a plan for the rollout of Core i9.
[3105.78 → 3108.66] So we're going to do this here, this here, and it has to do with CPU yields.
[3108.74 → 3109.34] It has to do with that.
[3109.80 → 3112.40] Honestly, I wonder if part of it has to do with that.
[3112.48 → 3116.70] They just like actually on the engineering side have no idea how they're going to launch this.
[3116.70 → 3118.56] And they're just trying to buy some time.
[3118.58 → 3119.04] I could see it.
[3119.34 → 3127.02] This will be interesting because this is going to be pretty much the first time ever that I will see a motherboard full cover block and be like, yeah, good call.
[3127.16 → 3128.02] That makes sense.
[3128.10 → 3128.26] Yeah.
[3128.68 → 3128.88] Yeah.
[3129.06 → 3131.24] Because in the past it's looked really cool.
[3131.34 → 3131.46] Yeah.
[3131.56 → 3136.22] But it's been like, oh, okay, that's an excessively expensive PC probably because of a showcase.
[3136.22 → 3142.26] And it probably makes no sense in terms of actually anyone ever doing this, but it looks cool for whatever brand wanted to show it off.
[3142.74 → 3144.00] Like, sure, why not?
[3144.12 → 3145.96] But that'll be pretty cool.
[3146.96 → 3150.44] It'll be interesting having people like actually ask questions about full cover blocks.
[3150.60 → 3151.12] I know, right?
[3152.52 → 3154.32] All right.
[3154.36 → 3155.46] What else we've got for topics?
[3155.82 → 3157.16] I just have to pause the show for a second.
[3157.16 → 3164.46] TimmyVal123 in the Twitch chat just said in all capital letters, I just wanted to make sure that I re-echo this.
[3164.78 → 3165.70] I have a boyfriend.
[3166.52 → 3169.68] I just wanted to make sure it's apparently extremely important.
[3169.92 → 3170.70] That you have one?
[3170.80 → 3171.06] No.
[3171.16 → 3171.88] Or that Timmy does?
[3171.96 → 3172.58] That Timmy does.
[3172.70 → 3173.56] Hey, you know what?
[3173.72 → 3175.42] Timmy, congrats, okay?
[3175.56 → 3175.98] Good job.
[3175.98 → 3181.88] All right, Facebook plans to unveil a $200, now we've heard that before.
[3182.12 → 3182.36] Yeah.
[3182.94 → 3183.16] Yeah.
[3183.62 → 3184.94] Wireless.
[3185.28 → 3185.90] That's new.
[3186.22 → 3188.86] Oculus VR headset in 2018.
[3189.84 → 3192.42] The whole Twitch chat is like, congrats, Timmy.
[3194.74 → 3195.56] Oh, man.
[3196.10 → 3197.60] Yeah, I mean, that's cool.
[3197.98 → 3198.72] Codename Pacific.
[3199.02 → 3201.26] If anyone's looking to buy an Oculus Rift.
[3201.26 → 3210.12] It's designed, and this is going to terrify you, to bridge the gap between cheap smartphone-mounted VR headsets and high-end gaming ones.
[3214.08 → 3218.22] It does not need to be tethered to a PC or a phone.
[3218.46 → 3221.58] It will ship next year and represent an entirely new category.
[3222.22 → 3224.00] The device, hold on, just hold it in for now.
[3224.24 → 3228.96] The device resembles a more compact version of the Rift and will be lighter than Samsung's Gear VR headset.
[3228.96 → 3234.72] The idea is that someone will be able to pull the headset out of their bag and watch movies on a flight just the way you can now with a phone or tablet.
[3234.98 → 3235.26] Watch movies on a flight.
[3235.26 → 3237.24] Oh, hold it in.
[3237.62 → 3242.36] The new headset will have a similar interface to a Gear VR and can be controlled via wireless remote.
[3242.88 → 3246.24] They plan to power the product with a Snapdragon mobile chip from Qualcomm,
[3246.66 → 3251.60] and its gaming power will be superior to that of the Gear VR, but unlike the powerful Rift device,
[3252.00 → 3254.42] and it will not include positional tracking technology.
[3254.84 → 3255.62] Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[3255.62 → 3259.82] They plan to begin briefing content makers on the device by October,
[3259.82 → 3262.40] and it will have a download store.
[3262.96 → 3266.18] Oh, the download store will be rewritten and accessible from a virtual reality interface.
[3267.00 → 3267.56] Um.
[3269.46 → 3269.90] And.
[3272.40 → 3272.96] Go.
[3273.18 → 3274.00] So they gave up.
[3278.22 → 3278.70] Like.
[3279.72 → 3280.78] Is that it?
[3280.86 → 3281.78] Is that all that I have to say?
[3281.86 → 3282.94] Oculus just gave up.
[3282.94 → 3284.50] They're just like, ah, screw it.
[3284.82 → 3285.46] VR's done.
[3285.86 → 3286.46] We're out of here.
[3286.82 → 3287.10] Uh.
[3287.14 → 3288.32] We have lots of Facebook money.
[3288.46 → 3288.98] That's fine.
[3289.08 → 3292.32] No one's buying headsets because they're overpriced and not very good right now.
[3292.40 → 3293.90] So we're just going to stop developing those,
[3294.06 → 3296.80] and we'll just make a phone that's built into the headsets.
[3296.86 → 3297.98] You can't take the phone out.
[3298.38 → 3299.48] And, uh, there you go.
[3299.48 → 3305.60] You could just buy this one that you can just slip this device that you've literally always effing carry on you in the front of it,
[3305.68 → 3309.40] and it'll just work, and that would be totally fine, and it doesn't cost that much,
[3309.50 → 3313.60] but no, it's going to be ever so slightly faster, and you can watch movies on the plane!
[3314.56 → 3315.04] Wow!
[3315.42 → 3317.06] Because you can't already do that on your phone,
[3317.14 → 3320.56] or, like, the screen that's built into the freaking chair in front of you.
[3320.68 → 3321.54] It's going to suck.
[3321.54 → 3322.54] Hmm.
[3323.22 → 3325.46] Word that I'm not going to say in terms of performance,
[3325.82 → 3327.16] and that's a huge issue right now.
[3327.40 → 3329.16] VR applications for desktop,
[3329.50 → 3330.94] your desktop computer,
[3331.28 → 3334.64] is usually not fast enough to run really, really high-fidelity,
[3334.86 → 3336.44] really, really high-quality games.
[3336.52 → 3337.54] It's a little bit of an issue.
[3337.86 → 3338.84] It's a little bit hard to do.
[3338.90 → 3340.44] It's possible, but it's difficult.
[3340.72 → 3344.52] And then, the headsets that you have right now for desktop tethered,
[3344.52 → 3346.70] like the Five and the current Rift,
[3346.96 → 3348.50] don't have good enough screens,
[3348.76 → 3350.46] don't have good enough a lot of other kinds of stuff
[3350.46 → 3353.12] to be at the minimum quality that consumers expect,
[3353.32 → 3354.70] and they're way too freaking expensive!
[3354.90 → 3357.12] So you release a dedicated $200 device,
[3357.32 → 3358.66] which no one's going to really want to buy,
[3358.76 → 3360.80] because they can just slip their thing into a daydream or whatever,
[3360.92 → 3362.34] which should be a lot cheaper,
[3362.56 → 3364.50] and probably will be now that this launches,
[3365.34 → 3365.82] for no reason.
[3365.82 → 3367.88] Not to mention that stuff like this already has existed.
[3368.28 → 3369.50] And it's so stupid.
[3369.66 → 3373.18] I was literally the product manager for View6 back at NCI.
[3373.50 → 3374.46] Sony has one.
[3374.62 → 3374.84] Yeah.
[3375.90 → 3380.40] Like, Sony professionally has a movie viewer designed for...
[3380.40 → 3382.14] Are you ready to chill out a little bit?
[3382.76 → 3385.22] Because I withheld one key piece of information from you.
[3385.22 → 3385.56] Oh, God.
[3385.70 → 3387.72] I'm like very angry and disappointed, but...
[3387.72 → 3390.44] Facebook has also said it's working on a prototype device
[3390.44 → 3393.26] named Santa Cruz that is basically a wireless Rift,
[3393.50 → 3396.48] with the full power of the original device, sans PC.
[3397.22 → 3399.06] Actually, that's not going to make you any less mad, probably.
[3399.64 → 3400.44] Sans PC.
[3400.64 → 3401.32] Without a PC.
[3402.66 → 3403.20] Wait, what?
[3404.06 → 3404.66] Okay, sorry.
[3404.76 → 3407.00] I thought they were just talking about wireless Rift.
[3407.00 → 3408.32] I didn't read the last two words, okay?
[3408.38 → 3409.74] I don't understand how that makes any sense either.
[3409.74 → 3410.16] Sans PC.
[3410.50 → 3411.82] So basically...
[3411.82 → 3413.16] So you need a backpack or something?
[3413.16 → 3415.42] So basically, it's a porn device now.
[3415.70 → 3416.08] Yes.
[3416.68 → 3418.10] And you can watch porn on a plane.
[3418.20 → 3418.80] They gave up.
[3419.74 → 3422.18] Like, I've mentioned on, like, two WAN shows recently,
[3422.24 → 3424.42] I've gotten some flack for it, but it is a thing.
[3425.22 → 3426.78] It's not all the posts,
[3426.78 → 3429.66] but there's a notably increased amount,
[3429.96 → 3432.12] compared to quite a few months back,
[3432.32 → 3434.34] if you go to, like, the Oculus Subreddit,
[3434.60 → 3436.60] of posts that are just about porn.
[3437.18 → 3437.98] And you know what?
[3438.12 → 3439.86] You want to look at porn on your device?
[3440.16 → 3440.84] Go for it.
[3440.94 → 3441.64] I don't care.
[3441.86 → 3443.34] I don't give a crap at all.
[3443.68 → 3446.46] But, what these things are really supposed to be doing
[3446.46 → 3447.60] in the long run is, like,
[3447.68 → 3450.74] really, fascinating entertainment mediums.
[3450.74 → 3452.28] Not watching movies on a plane!
[3452.48 → 3453.48] I'm talking about, like, interesting...
[3453.48 → 3454.28] A virtual thing!
[3454.66 → 3455.48] No, hold on.
[3455.48 → 3457.02] Picture this.
[3457.14 → 3457.64] Oh, God.
[3457.74 → 3458.80] Virtual big screen.
[3458.94 → 3459.24] Oh.
[3460.38 → 3462.40] I just killed him a little bit inside.
[3462.64 → 3464.00] I think every time...
[3464.00 → 3464.44] Hold on.
[3464.84 → 3465.36] Get this.
[3466.06 → 3467.48] Simulated theatre experience.
[3467.52 → 3468.50] This is so bad!
[3468.84 → 3470.10] It is so bad!
[3470.44 → 3471.54] I don't understand!
[3472.42 → 3473.86] It's so bad!
[3474.68 → 3475.16] Ugh.
[3475.46 → 3478.46] But there's such interesting experiences that you can do,
[3478.52 → 3480.12] and such interesting experiences that you can have.
[3480.12 → 3481.24] If you come to LTX,
[3481.36 → 3482.48] I'll try to show you some of them.
[3482.78 → 3484.12] There's specific...
[3484.12 → 3487.72] Servos is a specific VR game development company
[3487.72 → 3490.98] that is making very good and very interesting things.
[3491.62 → 3493.82] Raw Data, and I don't remember the name of their new one,
[3493.88 → 3494.80] but it's a running one,
[3494.96 → 3495.74] and it's racing,
[3495.88 → 3497.00] and it's actually really cool.
[3497.12 → 3497.94] You race against each other,
[3498.04 → 3498.88] and you can, like...
[3498.88 → 3499.76] You have to run around,
[3499.90 → 3501.12] but it's kind of like skis.
[3501.26 → 3502.62] I finally got Arizona Sunshine.
[3503.20 → 3504.46] Arizona Sunshine's pretty cool.
[3504.46 → 3507.48] There's robocalls, like amazing.
[3507.74 → 3509.92] Like, there's really, perfect experiences that you can have,
[3510.06 → 3512.54] but the device was supposed to be a different price than it was,
[3512.64 → 3513.52] by a lot,
[3513.76 → 3515.78] because there's a huge cost in the computer already,
[3516.08 → 3518.08] and it's way too expensive.
[3518.42 → 3519.04] PISSED OFF!
[3519.14 → 3520.20] This was really fun.
[3520.56 → 3522.70] Okay, why don't we talk about something a little lighter?
[3523.70 → 3525.20] Well, it's a little heavy.
[3525.76 → 3526.74] The KFC phone!
[3527.80 → 3530.24] It's the only thing about KFC that could be light at all.
[3530.40 → 3532.46] This might make more sense than that stupid thing that they use.
[3532.46 → 3535.94] Huawei's special edition KFC smartphone for China.
[3536.42 → 3538.28] Someone in the chat just said,
[3538.36 → 3539.36] man cares too much.
[3539.44 → 3539.86] I do.
[3540.88 → 3542.66] I really want VR to work,
[3543.10 → 3544.16] and I just, I feel...
[3544.16 → 3547.74] I feel like they're just doing, like, clearly the wrong things.
[3547.74 → 3548.68] They'll make it work.
[3548.76 → 3549.78] It's just going to be, like,
[3549.78 → 3553.92] kind of lame mainstream VR for, like, a long time.
[3554.22 → 3554.90] A long time.
[3555.08 → 3557.20] And, like, that gap, I was talking to...
[3557.20 → 3557.34] Yeah.
[3557.36 → 3558.12] Was it Rubio?
[3558.38 → 3559.02] Jeff Rubio?
[3559.12 → 3560.08] I could have the name wrong.
[3560.30 → 3562.60] But the guy from Naughty Dog that now works for Oculus.
[3563.96 → 3565.78] And he gave a timeline,
[3565.94 → 3566.56] and I was like, you know what?
[3566.56 → 3567.04] That makes sense.
[3567.08 → 3567.92] And I think it was something about,
[3568.16 → 3570.30] something around three years from when I had that meeting.
[3570.64 → 3570.80] Yeah.
[3570.82 → 3571.82] And you can line up that meeting,
[3572.06 → 3575.20] because that lined up with a Counter-Strike tournament
[3575.20 → 3578.00] where I made a video about watching the Counter-Strike tournament
[3578.00 → 3578.60] with the Five.
[3578.84 → 3579.06] Right.
[3579.78 → 3583.30] And I don't think that's going to happen anymore.
[3584.80 → 3585.94] So, in other news,
[3586.16 → 3590.46] it's to celebrate KFC's 30th anniversary within the country of China.
[3591.14 → 3591.52] Okay.
[3591.74 → 3594.78] The KFC edition of the Huawei Enjoy 7 Plus
[3594.78 → 3597.84] was unveiled by the restaurant chain via its official Weibo page.
[3598.38 → 3600.36] In addition to a snazzy red finish
[3600.36 → 3602.32] and a picture of the kernel on the back of the device,
[3602.66 → 3605.64] the smartphone comes preloaded with the Music app,
[3605.64 → 3610.10] which allows you to play music over the speaker system installed in KFC restaurants.
[3610.18 → 3610.54] What?
[3610.74 → 3615.54] Which definitely wouldn't get annoying really, really, really fast for everybody else
[3615.54 → 3618.88] and won't be eliminated entirely almost immediately.
[3619.50 → 3621.96] Only 5,000 of these smartphones will be produced.
[3622.16 → 3624.56] There's probably, like, pre-approved music that you can put through it.
[3624.56 → 3625.12] I guess so.
[3625.12 → 3627.74] And there are other weird KFC things.
[3628.34 → 3629.44] So, um...
[3629.44 → 3630.04] Oh, no, never mind.
[3630.08 → 3631.64] These are just other weird KFC things.
[3632.38 → 3635.30] They had a takeout box that apparently doubled as a smartphone charger
[3635.30 → 3639.16] and a facial recognition scanner in conjunction with search giant Baidu,
[3639.24 → 3641.44] Baidu, whatever, to help offer meal suggestions.
[3642.22 → 3642.74] Oh, boy.
[3642.74 → 3642.78] Okay.
[3643.00 → 3643.98] Like, they said...
[3643.98 → 3646.18] Well, I guess it just looks for how many chins you have
[3646.18 → 3648.24] and decides how many pieces of chicken you need.
[3648.60 → 3649.82] Like, is that how that would work?
[3652.10 → 3654.28] I wonder how difficult it would be to do that.
[3655.00 → 3657.60] Get, like, machine learning to, like, analyze faces.
[3658.28 → 3660.14] That would actually be fascinating.
[3660.30 → 3660.88] If you could...
[3660.88 → 3662.12] How accurate it would be.
[3662.18 → 3663.58] If you could try and figure out...
[3663.58 → 3664.22] That would be very interesting.
[3664.22 → 3666.66] Because KFC, unlike somewhere...
[3666.66 → 3668.50] Okay, so let's take A&W.
[3668.64 → 3671.34] Actually, A&W in the States is very different from up here.
[3671.34 → 3673.72] So none of this might make any sense.
[3674.14 → 3675.22] But let's take A&W.
[3675.48 → 3678.08] You can be, like, a matzo burger person
[3678.08 → 3680.00] or you can be a teen burger person
[3680.00 → 3683.14] and there would be nothing you could know
[3683.14 → 3684.46] or, like, a chubby chicken burger.
[3684.68 → 3687.36] These are all sort of equivalent quantities of food.
[3687.46 → 3687.96] They're both the same.
[3688.06 → 3689.32] But they taste quite different.
[3689.58 → 3689.80] Yes.
[3690.86 → 3693.72] Whereas at KFC, there's chicken
[3693.72 → 3696.56] and there's less chicken and there's more chicken.
[3696.66 → 3697.76] There's, like, a bucket of chicken.
[3698.06 → 3699.90] There's, like, a little tiny box of chicken.
[3699.90 → 3700.94] Or a small box of...
[3700.94 → 3701.76] Bucket of chicken.
[3702.02 → 3702.20] Yeah.
[3702.20 → 3702.48] Like...
[3702.48 → 3702.70] Yeah.
[3702.84 → 3703.86] Or a trough of chicken.
[3703.98 → 3705.44] Like, it's all about chicken.
[3705.98 → 3707.56] I would be curious to know
[3707.56 → 3710.88] if you could just enter, like, a picture of yourself
[3710.88 → 3712.88] and, like, of your house
[3712.88 → 3714.28] and of your...
[3714.28 → 3715.20] Of your house.
[3715.20 → 3716.60] And entered your BMI.
[3717.10 → 3718.42] If it could tell you
[3718.42 → 3720.06] what you were planning to order at KFC.
[3720.06 → 3723.86] That would be a very interesting study.
[3725.94 → 3728.30] Just in, like, in, like, how humans do things
[3728.30 → 3729.10] and, like, psychology,
[3729.22 → 3730.94] it would just be a very, very interesting study.
[3732.72 → 3733.68] I would read it.
[3737.06 → 3737.46] Okay.
[3738.06 → 3740.60] The OnePlus 5's display is upside down.
[3740.68 → 3742.66] So this was posted by Nerd Slayer on the forum.
[3742.78 → 3743.06] Oops.
[3745.18 → 3745.54] Confirmed.
[3746.04 → 3747.50] The jelly scrolling effect,
[3747.56 → 3748.98] which, honestly, I didn't even notice.
[3749.12 → 3749.88] It is amazing.
[3749.98 → 3751.48] The kinds of things, like...
[3751.48 → 3752.90] Like, well, it's stupid
[3752.90 → 3754.56] because, like, I'll be able to tell the difference
[3754.56 → 3758.62] between, like, 72 and 60 hertz on a display.
[3758.86 → 3759.12] Yeah.
[3759.84 → 3761.32] If I'm playing a game or something
[3761.32 → 3762.80] and people will be like, who cares?
[3763.32 → 3765.00] Whereas, like, I look at, like, a phone
[3765.00 → 3766.28] and I'm like...
[3766.28 → 3768.66] There's a slight kind of rebounding effect
[3768.66 → 3769.30] when you scroll
[3769.30 → 3772.72] and they're calling it the jelly scrolling effect
[3772.72 → 3773.52] or something like that.
[3773.52 → 3776.24] And apparently it is caused
[3776.24 → 3780.36] by OnePlus moving the motherboard
[3780.36 → 3782.58] and, hence, flipping the display panel
[3782.58 → 3783.56] in order to accommodate
[3783.56 → 3785.52] their new dual-lens camera module.
[3786.50 → 3790.04] So they consciously rearranged the internals
[3790.04 → 3792.64] and then are using a...
[3792.64 → 3795.10] Normally only used for diagnostics,
[3795.14 → 3796.14] but they actually used this.
[3796.18 → 3800.20] So they used a field that exists in Android
[3800.20 → 3802.92] where you can flip the display 180 degrees...
[3802.92 → 3803.38] Oh, I see it.
[3803.38 → 3810.22] ...in order to account for this rearrangement.
[3810.46 → 3811.26] That's so weird.
[3811.30 → 3812.56] And so what users did
[3812.56 → 3815.20] was they manually changed other devices
[3815.20 → 3817.18] to be upside down
[3817.18 → 3820.58] and the jelly scrolling effect appeared on them.
[3820.64 → 3821.64] Now, what I'd like to know,
[3821.70 → 3822.72] because obviously,
[3822.72 → 3825.36] if you hold a display like this
[3825.36 → 3828.22] that doesn't have an upside-down display installation
[3828.22 → 3828.80] and go like this
[3828.80 → 3829.50] or you hold it like this
[3829.50 → 3830.18] and go like this,
[3830.50 → 3831.46] it doesn't matter.
[3831.72 → 3832.74] So what I want to know
[3832.74 → 3833.84] is if this is just a matter
[3833.84 → 3834.88] of a simple optimization
[3834.88 → 3837.22] that could be done in software...
[3837.22 → 3837.98] It feels like it would be.
[3840.38 → 3841.82] So we'll see.
[3842.36 → 3843.04] We'll see.
[3843.04 → 3846.50] The Google Pixel 2 design was leaked.
[3846.62 → 3849.52] This was posted by MrChow19910319
[3849.52 → 3850.44] on the forum
[3850.44 → 3851.78] and the original article here
[3851.78 → 3853.72] is from Android Police.
[3853.88 → 3856.64] Apparently, it will be made by LG this time
[3856.64 → 3858.18] rather than HTC.
[3859.08 → 3861.34] And this is apparently the Pixel XL
[3861.34 → 3863.74] with a low-bezel AMOLED display
[3863.74 → 3865.34] and a squeezable frame.
[3865.92 → 3868.58] So HTC won't be the only one
[3868.58 → 3870.24] with a squeezable frame.
[3870.80 → 3870.98] Neat.
[3870.98 → 3873.14] I guess that's cool.
[3873.52 → 3874.46] It's one of those things
[3874.46 → 3876.38] that I've never really asked for.
[3876.58 → 3877.26] Why do you...
[3877.26 → 3878.30] What's the benefit?
[3878.30 → 3879.76] You can have it do stuff.
[3880.28 → 3880.68] Okay.
[3880.92 → 3881.12] Yeah.
[3882.60 → 3884.04] Six-inch AMOLED display
[3884.04 → 3885.10] with round corners.
[3885.42 → 3886.68] Glass window on the back
[3886.68 → 3888.04] is smaller this time.
[3888.20 → 3890.00] Fingerprint reader is no longer inside of it
[3890.00 → 3890.78] but below it.
[3891.18 → 3892.60] No visible antenna bands.
[3892.80 → 3894.22] It's believed it will have a squeezable frame.
[3894.40 → 3895.56] Okay, so that's pretty much all we know.
[3895.64 → 3897.60] None of that sounds super important to me.
[3898.68 → 3900.64] There are things that I care a lot more about
[3900.64 → 3902.24] on the Pixel 2 than any of that information.
[3902.36 → 3903.24] So I think we'll have to wait.
[3904.42 → 3906.68] Logitech is on a roll here
[3906.68 → 3907.62] with acquisitions.
[3907.74 → 3909.60] This was posted by Niacin on the forum.
[3909.68 → 3911.48] The original article here is from CNET, apparently.
[3911.84 → 3914.18] Or I could just use the press release
[3914.18 → 3914.86] that they sent me.
[3915.50 → 3916.30] Autoplay, no.
[3916.30 → 3918.14] So there won't be
[3918.14 → 3920.72] like a gaming headset industry eventually
[3920.72 → 3922.42] because it'll just be Logitech headsets.
[3922.42 → 3922.82] And Racer.
[3923.10 → 3923.64] And Racer.
[3923.96 → 3924.52] That's fair.
[3924.52 → 3925.92] Who else exists?
[3929.12 → 3930.94] Turtle Beach is sort of still kicking around
[3930.94 → 3932.18] like on the console side I think.
[3932.70 → 3932.98] Okay.
[3933.38 → 3934.76] I don't understand quite how
[3934.76 → 3937.16] but I didn't understand why Astro
[3937.16 → 3938.40] had a right to exist either.
[3938.80 → 3939.58] I mean to be clear
[3939.58 → 3941.22] apparently the A40 is great.
[3942.06 → 3943.50] The only one I ever reviewed
[3943.50 → 3944.30] was the A50
[3944.30 → 3945.00] and it was terrible.
[3945.70 → 3947.42] I've never had a good experience with them.
[3947.50 → 3948.86] It was an abominable value.
[3949.44 → 3950.62] And that was compared to
[3950.62 → 3951.92] wireless headphones that
[3951.92 → 3953.08] or headsets that existed
[3953.08 → 3953.96] back then.
[3954.66 → 3956.14] And to my knowledge
[3956.14 → 3957.90] I don't think they've updated it.
[3958.74 → 3960.82] So they bought Ultimate Ears.
[3960.98 → 3962.24] They bought Jaybird.
[3962.72 → 3963.96] They acquired Sci Tech.
[3964.30 → 3965.36] And they've been doing great things.
[3965.88 → 3966.96] I haven't seen what they've done
[3966.96 → 3967.70] with Sci Tech yet.
[3967.74 → 3968.58] Have they released anything?
[3968.80 → 3970.00] I don't know if they've done much
[3970.00 → 3970.68] with Sci Tech.
[3971.96 → 3973.58] But basically Logitech
[3973.58 → 3974.34] kind of went
[3974.34 → 3974.88] well
[3974.88 → 3976.40] we're an engineering company
[3976.40 → 3977.84] and we're just going to embrace that
[3977.84 → 3978.54] and
[3978.54 → 3980.44] screw it.
[3980.54 → 3981.70] We're just going to buy brands.
[3981.92 → 3984.46] It's been working so far.
[3984.54 → 3985.72] The Ultimate Ears one especially.
[3986.64 → 3987.58] I'm interested to see
[3987.58 → 3988.36] what they do with Sci Tech
[3988.36 → 3989.52] because I love that kind of stuff.
[3989.82 → 3990.76] But yeah.
[3990.96 → 3991.14] Yeah.
[3991.24 → 3992.74] Meanwhile Razor is running around
[3992.74 → 3993.82] buying THX
[3993.82 → 3995.36] and Phone Maker Next bit.
[3997.36 → 3998.70] So apparently the deal
[3998.70 → 3999.92] will close in early August
[3999.92 → 4000.50] and
[4000.50 → 4001.86] yeah
[4001.86 → 4002.52] basically
[4002.52 → 4003.60] I didn't even read
[4003.60 → 4004.70] any of Logitech's statements
[4004.70 → 4005.10] about it
[4005.10 → 4006.42] because this is fairly transparent.
[4006.86 → 4006.98] Yeah.
[4006.98 → 4007.72] Logitech
[4007.72 → 4009.08] couldn't figure out
[4009.08 → 4010.82] why the hell
[4010.82 → 4012.48] anyone was using
[4012.48 → 4013.82] Astro Gaming headsets.
[4013.92 → 4014.52] Which is valid.
[4014.80 → 4015.90] So they went
[4015.90 → 4016.64] okay
[4016.64 → 4017.28] well
[4017.28 → 4019.02] I don't want to deal with this anymore
[4019.02 → 4020.28] and bought them.
[4021.16 → 4021.90] Which is valid.
[4022.56 → 4022.80] Yeah.
[4025.32 → 4027.24] Some of the Astro Gaming branding
[4027.24 → 4028.58] especially from way back in the day
[4028.58 → 4029.38] was really sick.
[4030.06 → 4030.50] Like I remember
[4030.50 → 4031.22] they had
[4031.22 → 4032.10] at PAX
[4032.10 → 4032.86] they were giving away
[4032.86 → 4033.82] an Astro Gaming shirt
[4033.82 → 4035.06] and it was like
[4035.06 → 4036.28] by far the coolest one
[4036.28 → 4036.76] at the event.
[4037.48 → 4038.20] And like they had
[4038.20 → 4039.24] a really cool booth
[4039.24 → 4040.18] and they partnered
[4040.18 → 4041.34] with really cool people.
[4041.86 → 4042.92] So I could understand
[4042.92 → 4043.62] how if like
[4043.62 → 4044.14] you're just
[4044.14 → 4045.96] woefully ignorant
[4045.96 → 4047.04] in terms of headsets
[4047.04 → 4047.54] and you're like
[4047.54 → 4048.84] I went to this cool event
[4048.84 → 4049.92] and they had cool stuff
[4049.92 → 4050.92] I'm going to tell my friends
[4050.92 → 4051.82] and we're all going to buy them.
[4052.98 → 4053.40] You know what I mean?
[4053.54 → 4054.60] Especially before like
[4054.60 → 4056.26] reviews on that kind of stuff
[4056.26 → 4057.06] was a big thing
[4057.06 → 4058.00] and easily accessible.
[4059.58 → 4060.18] Lately though
[4060.18 → 4060.64] I don't know how
[4060.64 → 4061.24] they're still around.
[4062.56 → 4063.50] I don't know man.
[4064.14 → 4064.58] Apparently
[4064.58 → 4065.56] this is great.
[4066.50 → 4068.08] So apparently
[4068.08 → 4069.34] Logitech is taking in
[4069.34 → 4070.42] and if it ain't broke
[4070.42 → 4071.76] don't fix it approach here.
[4074.26 → 4075.60] And the Astro
[4075.60 → 4077.26] and Logitech G brands
[4077.26 → 4078.84] will keep separate teams
[4078.84 → 4082.88] and basically they're saying
[4082.88 → 4083.66] we don't just want to
[4083.66 → 4084.32] jam a new product
[4084.32 → 4084.86] down your throats
[4084.86 → 4085.26] every year
[4085.26 → 4086.26] just because we can.
[4086.84 → 4088.38] So that's the nice way
[4088.38 → 4088.80] of saying
[4088.80 → 4090.92] if you guys like this trash
[4090.92 → 4091.84] then we'll just keep
[4091.84 → 4092.54] making it for you
[4092.54 → 4092.86] I guess.
[4092.86 → 4094.88] As far as I can tell.
[4095.12 → 4095.52] Wow.
[4095.78 → 4096.76] Because there's no doubt
[4096.76 → 4098.50] that Logitech's engineering
[4098.50 → 4099.92] knows a lot more
[4099.92 → 4100.54] about engineering
[4100.54 → 4101.98] than Astro's engineering.
[4104.18 → 4105.04] Astro might be able
[4105.04 → 4105.68] to help them make it
[4105.68 → 4106.40] so that the headsets
[4106.40 → 4107.44] don't fall off people's heads.
[4107.68 → 4108.04] Okay.
[4108.18 → 4108.68] That's fair.
[4108.76 → 4109.34] That would be good.
[4109.50 → 4110.04] That's fair.
[4110.18 → 4111.18] One little update there.
[4111.40 → 4111.60] Yeah.
[4111.68 → 4112.16] That's fair.
[4112.24 → 4112.36] Yeah.
[4112.78 → 4113.76] But then Logitech
[4113.76 → 4115.00] also could have just like
[4115.00 → 4115.84] gone and bought
[4115.84 → 4116.82] a Hyper Cloud
[4116.82 → 4118.94] and disassembled it
[4118.94 → 4119.64] if they wanted to
[4119.64 → 4120.58] understand how that works.
[4120.76 → 4120.92] Yeah.
[4122.32 → 4122.88] All right.
[4122.94 → 4123.72] So on that note

[4148.40 → 4149.12] People are calling me
[4149.12 → 4150.22] Linus Lame Tips.
[4151.74 → 4152.12] Wow.
[4152.30 → 4152.62] Why?
[4152.78 → 4153.96] I have never been called
[4153.96 → 4155.76] something that offensive
[4155.76 → 4156.40] in my life.
[4156.68 → 4157.24] Look at this.
[4157.32 → 4158.24] How do they do this?
[4158.34 → 4159.06] Like how do you
[4159.06 → 4159.88] screw this up?
[4161.34 → 4162.06] It's unbelievable.
[4162.06 → 4162.74] The easiest thing
[4162.74 → 4163.34] in the world
[4163.34 → 4163.96] would be to use
[4163.96 → 4164.58] the same file.
[4164.76 → 4165.46] See like this one's
[4165.46 → 4166.60] see this one's right
[4166.60 → 4167.14] sort of
[4167.14 → 4167.82] except the face
[4167.82 → 4168.60] is different colours.
[4168.70 → 4169.92] Why did they change?
[4170.02 → 4171.32] I don't know.
[4172.80 → 4173.02] Ugh.
[4173.96 → 4203.94] Thank you.
