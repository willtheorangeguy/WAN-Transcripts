[0.00 → 0.92] I was going, no.
[1.28 → 1.56] Hey.
[1.90 → 4.38] And no, it had nothing.
[4.62 → 8.30] Okay, the name Linus Tech Tips had nothing to do with me being smart.
[8.88 → 10.40] He was talking about Paul.
[11.54 → 12.12] Oh, Paul.
[12.92 → 14.18] That's all about you, Linus.
[15.76 → 18.38] Linus hears someone call someone else smart.
[18.48 → 20.82] It's like, obviously you're talking about me.
[22.28 → 27.36] Well, okay, so I've already told Paul I think his channel name is very clever.
[27.36 → 38.30] But I think almost everyone who started a channel well before they thought YouTube would even be a thing probably regrets their name.
[38.30 → 39.10] Their name, yeah.
[39.20 → 41.58] Yeah, like there's that.
[41.60 → 42.42] I just ripped off Tom's hardware.
[43.06 → 44.36] Duncan, Duncan33303.
[44.96 → 48.46] Yeah, Duncan33303, like SaabKyle04.
[49.22 → 55.18] Like just all those kinds of just, it's like, yeah, the guy makes videos about a lot more than just SAAB.
[55.18 → 57.12] Does SAAB even exist anymore?
[57.36 → 62.10] I love the guys on the forum whose name will be like, no offence to you if this is your name on the forum.
[62.32 → 62.52] Something.
[62.52 → 65.02] But like GTX780.
[65.58 → 65.90] Oh.
[66.12 → 68.60] And then it's like been a few years, and it's like, uh.
[68.74 → 69.76] You're going to beat yourself, bro.
[69.76 → 77.60] So there was a guy on the old NCI forum whose username was like Canuck2004.
[77.60 → 81.20] And I'm like, dude.
[83.04 → 85.34] Nothing interesting happened in 2004.
[85.34 → 86.84] Okay.
[87.04 → 89.70] 2004 was one of the best used for gaming hands down.
[90.08 → 91.34] Like this is actually a huge thing.
[91.70 → 93.00] Halo came out in 2004.
[93.16 → 95.50] World of Warcraft's original release was in 2004.
[96.08 → 97.00] I don't even know that.
[97.00 → 97.48] I'm trying to remember.
[97.54 → 97.94] No, no.
[98.08 → 98.42] Seriously.
[98.78 → 99.22] Look it up.
[99.30 → 99.56] Look up.
[99.62 → 101.90] Look up top five games of 2004.
[101.90 → 102.46] I can't believe you.
[102.50 → 102.88] I'm just saying.
[103.02 → 103.76] If you Google.
[103.90 → 105.26] You can't even share my screen right now.
[105.32 → 107.40] But if you Google top games of 2004.
[107.52 → 108.44] Let me do this right now.
[108.50 → 108.98] Because this is like.
[109.10 → 109.82] This is a thing.
[110.76 → 111.64] You know what my next.
[111.74 → 113.72] You know what my next YouTube channel branding is going to be?
[113.72 → 114.76] It's going to be Nitwit 2.
[114.76 → 115.06] Okay.
[115.20 → 116.00] Half-Life 2.
[116.22 → 116.92] Doom 3.
[117.12 → 118.56] Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
[118.78 → 119.46] Halo 2.
[119.60 → 120.72] World of Warcraft.
[120.88 → 122.06] Far Cry.
[122.58 → 124.42] Unreal Tournament 2004.
[124.44 → 125.76] Tom Clancy's Splitter Cell.
[125.76 → 126.12] Total War.
[126.20 → 126.44] Okay.
[126.56 → 128.64] This is looking like a pretty good lineup.
[128.66 → 129.44] Battlefield Vietnam.
[129.88 → 130.90] Need for Speed Underground.
[132.18 → 133.44] Linus has been wrong before.
[133.58 → 134.84] Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic.
[135.34 → 135.76] Fable.
[136.08 → 136.58] Sims 2.
[136.70 → 137.52] Like we're not into it.
[137.56 → 138.26] But giant games.
[138.28 → 138.44] Okay.
[138.50 → 140.20] Thief Deadly Shadows wasn't very good.
[141.44 → 141.64] Okay.
[141.84 → 142.82] But still.
[143.48 → 143.80] Still.
[143.80 → 146.40] Counter Strike Source.
[146.74 → 148.90] By the transitive properties of games sucking.
[148.90 → 150.40] A Call of Duty game that was still good.
[150.68 → 151.00] Okay.
[151.14 → 153.68] Lord of the Rings Battle for Middle Earth was better than it got credit for.
[154.26 → 154.48] Yeah.
[154.96 → 155.76] So there's that.
[156.74 → 157.70] There are Tribes.
[157.92 → 158.20] Okay.
[158.54 → 158.98] Painkiller.
[159.20 → 160.40] Star Wars Battlefront.
[160.52 → 160.74] Okay.
[160.82 → 161.12] All right.
[161.16 → 161.44] All right.
[161.50 → 161.74] All right.
[161.78 → 161.98] All right.
[162.28 → 162.48] Anyway.
[162.48 → 163.80] And this is just like the end of that.
[163.82 → 163.98] Okay.
[164.00 → 165.28] So the guy didn't play games though.
[165.96 → 167.50] So your argument falls on its face.
[167.50 → 168.22] Right there.
[168.22 → 168.82] Because it's Canucks.
[168.82 → 169.56] Not video games.
[169.72 → 171.52] If it was like Video Games 2004.
[171.76 → 172.34] I would have been like.
[172.46 → 173.04] You know what's up.
[173.04 → 174.78] The Canucks won nothing in 2004.
[175.52 → 175.72] Yeah.
[175.92 → 177.80] But then he could have just meant Canuck like.
[178.52 → 179.86] Is it derogatory?
[180.50 → 180.82] Canadian?
[180.82 → 181.12] For Canadians?
[181.40 → 181.50] Yeah.
[181.50 → 182.30] I don't know.
[182.36 → 183.70] Like we kind of embrace it.
[183.92 → 184.18] But like.
[184.72 → 188.30] I don't think there's a properly derogatory term for Canadians.
[188.48 → 189.22] Hey Paul.
[189.30 → 189.82] Paul Kyle.
[189.92 → 192.18] So if I were to call you guys like Yankee Doodles.
[192.36 → 193.38] Is that offensive?
[193.56 → 195.30] Or is that just like folksy?
[195.30 → 196.60] I think if you add the doodle.
[197.14 → 197.28] Yeah.
[197.32 → 198.40] So what if I called you guys Yanks?
[198.60 → 199.58] Interview right now is what you're saying?
[199.92 → 200.12] Basically.
[200.12 → 200.68] What's that?
[202.38 → 204.26] You want to end this interview right now?
[204.32 → 205.04] Because that's uh.
[205.24 → 205.54] Yeah.
[205.54 → 207.10] We take very much offence to you.
[207.10 → 207.78] I'm triggered.
[208.16 → 208.70] You're triggered.
[208.70 → 209.84] When I ever have been.
[210.82 → 211.26] Triggered.
[211.26 → 211.74] Triggered AF.
[211.74 → 212.86] I haven't even mentioned that on lives.
[212.86 → 216.34] I have never taken more offence to any word than Yankee.
[216.80 → 217.22] Than Yankee?
[217.22 → 218.12] Don't say it out loud Paul.
[218.16 → 218.50] I'm sorry.
[218.50 → 221.70] All right.
[221.70 → 224.74] We can say it to each other because we are Yankees.
[224.74 → 226.12] Does that mean that I get to say it?
[226.96 → 230.10] Is it a residency thing or a citizenship thing?
[230.26 → 230.52] Yeah.
[230.62 → 230.80] Yeah.
[230.80 → 231.58] Because he's a citizen.
[231.76 → 234.14] So is he allowed to call you guys Yankees?
[234.36 → 238.60] Honestly I've been called Yankee so few times in my life that I don't even know how it works.
[238.68 → 238.84] Yeah.
[239.62 → 241.34] I just thought that it was a baseball team.
[243.52 → 244.44] Assumed it had some.
[244.52 → 248.30] There was some like etymological history to it.
[248.60 → 248.94] I'm not.
[249.12 → 250.44] I don't look up those things you know.
[251.28 → 253.66] I feel like it's all about context and inflection right?
[253.78 → 254.20] All right.
[254.20 → 254.56] Probably.
[254.56 → 256.22] Hey you Yankee Doodle bastard.
[256.38 → 257.48] I'm like hey what's up bro?
[257.64 → 261.68] But if they're like you Yankee Doodle dandy.
[262.42 → 264.88] Then I'm like whoa we got beef bro.
[265.06 → 266.20] We got a fighter here.
[266.80 → 267.58] Take it outside.
[267.78 → 268.36] All right.
[268.48 → 270.94] So I should roll the intro at some point.
[271.72 → 278.12] And then so we have Paul and Kyle on the show to talk about the totally fair and totally justified ending to Scrapyard Wars 5.
[278.86 → 279.26] Boo.
[279.40 → 282.06] And I'm going to roll the intro.
[284.56 → 285.94] They can still hear us while the intro's rolling.
[285.94 → 286.78] Why don't we have an intro Paul?
[286.82 → 287.26] Just so you know.
[287.38 → 288.80] I think we look better than they do.
[291.36 → 291.80] Wow.
[293.48 → 293.92] Wow.
[294.18 → 295.26] I'm saying I got the GH5.
[295.32 → 296.42] I'm capturing from the GH5.
[297.18 → 297.60] That's that quality.
[298.28 → 299.64] There are so many dicks on this show.
[299.64 → 302.30] We have tinfoil over top of our camera.
[303.16 → 304.16] It's not tinfoil.
[304.26 → 305.60] It's special cine foil.
[305.92 → 306.38] Oh okay.
[306.38 → 312.38] We should probably spend most of the time talking about Brandon's lighting configuration that he set up here because I still...
[312.38 → 314.84] Haven't managed to recreate it.
[314.84 → 315.10] Yeah.
[315.40 → 316.44] It's impossible.
[317.58 → 319.50] You need to use the laundry basket.
[319.72 → 319.94] Yeah.
[320.10 → 320.78] The laundry basket.
[321.12 → 324.04] The tinfoil in between the laundry basket holes.
[324.54 → 332.34] Have the light set behind it at just the right distance to create this illusion of like depth and mystery to my garage.
[332.34 → 336.82] When Heather saw that first scene in Scrapyard Wars where it's in your garage that Brandon had lit, she was like,
[336.82 → 337.46] where is that?
[337.84 → 338.88] I was like, that's Paul's garage.
[338.98 → 341.06] She was like, you mean that shithole you stream from every Tuesday?
[342.26 → 343.38] Terrible looking place.
[343.62 → 344.36] Yeah, Brandon's perfect.
[344.36 → 352.50] So here's the issue with Brandon is that he asks for all this expensive fancy camera and lighting gear.
[352.50 → 363.96] But then you give him like a roll of duct tape and some chopsticks, and he manages to make it look awesome anyway.
[364.08 → 364.46] Maybe a paper towel.
[364.68 → 367.34] Yeah, so I'm kind of sitting here going, why am I spending all this money?
[367.70 → 374.72] When Brandon and I used to duo team like every show literally on the planet, I used to take like this Instagram series of photos,
[374.72 → 379.78] which was like Brandon's ghetto lighting setups that we would set up in hotel rooms and stuff.
[380.68 → 385.60] And like, okay, you have to give the man credit for being able to work with like the junk that he sometimes has to work with.
[385.76 → 390.88] But I don't think that's like a credit to not needing better gear.
[390.88 → 395.88] I think it's a credit to the crap that he had to deal with for such a ridiculously long time.
[395.90 → 398.12] Well, it's a matter of the definition of the word need.
[398.38 → 400.40] But no, that's skill versus potential.
[400.40 → 402.88] Have you ever seen the website Shitty Rigs?
[402.88 → 404.48] It's like ShittyRigs.com or something.
[404.70 → 409.96] It's all these like really poor film students who have to like to build rig material, camera equipment,
[410.08 → 412.88] out of just like paper and duct tape exactly like what you're saying.
[413.04 → 417.28] You wouldn't look at that and be like, wow, all the people on here, they really don't need better camera gear.
[417.66 → 419.82] I mean, it's like completely functional, steady camera.
[419.82 → 424.54] I mean, if I was paying the bill for the gear, then yeah, I totally would.
[424.60 → 426.14] That's exactly how that would go down.
[427.40 → 431.36] I mean, I remember, and I actually, this is a true story.
[431.36 → 437.36] I actually remember making the argument to Brandon that we shouldn't get C-stands.
[437.36 → 444.28] So for those of you watching who are not that into filming equipment, okay, Luke's going to go get one.
[444.34 → 445.16] Luke's going to go get one.
[445.22 → 445.80] Thank you, Luke.
[447.40 → 449.44] They're on the C-stand rack right there.
[449.44 → 449.76] Yes.
[450.16 → 451.60] So this is a C-stand.
[452.00 → 457.84] It has three feet at the bottom, and then it has an extend pole on this side here.
[458.06 → 464.78] And then it has this clamp at the top or this knobby at the top that you can use to hold stuff or whatever.
[464.92 → 468.08] And I'm like, you have got to be kidding me.
[468.46 → 468.90] It's a pole.
[468.90 → 469.62] Can we see Luke do some reps?
[469.62 → 473.26] It's a pole that holds something, and they're like $200.
[473.80 → 476.16] They're not cheap for the big ones like that.
[476.80 → 480.80] And Brandon's like, well, we need a C-stand so we can put our boom microphone on it.
[480.96 → 482.74] And I'm like, I'll show you a boom microphone.
[483.34 → 486.02] And this is back when we're operating out of the garage.
[486.36 → 491.58] So I grab my motorbike, throw it in neutral, roll it over.
[491.84 → 494.88] And then I prop the boom pole out of the handlebars.
[495.24 → 496.60] And I'm like, look, problem solved.
[496.90 → 499.44] He's like, no, that is not a solution.
[499.44 → 501.60] I'm like, can we record the video right now?
[501.70 → 502.46] He's like, yes.
[503.26 → 504.32] Then it's a solution.
[504.54 → 505.66] No C-stand budget.
[506.90 → 512.02] Until someone like does the like lean thing on the boom pole and your bike falls over.
[512.14 → 513.22] Yeah, until that happens.
[517.02 → 517.38] Yeah.
[518.20 → 518.68] All right.
[518.70 → 519.54] Oh my God, we don't work for you.
[520.34 → 520.74] Yeah.
[522.06 → 522.38] So.
[522.48 → 524.38] Are we doing news now or are we talking about Scrapyard Boys now?
[524.84 → 525.52] I don't know.
[525.60 → 527.66] Were there any news topics that jumped out to you guys?
[527.66 → 529.70] Do you want to talk about the leaked Core i9 benchmarks?
[530.64 → 530.86] Yeah.
[530.90 → 531.94] Did they take that down yet?
[531.94 → 533.06] Or is it still just there?
[533.32 → 537.66] So it was originally posted on the forum by who's this?
[539.04 → 540.60] PCGuy5960.
[540.76 → 542.40] See, this is one of those.
[542.40 → 549.18] PCGuy5960 is two generations out of date now.
[550.12 → 551.18] Poor PC Guy.
[551.28 → 552.12] Poor PC Guy.
[552.14 → 553.26] Even his logo's in i7.
[553.38 → 554.40] He's going full bore.
[554.60 → 554.82] Yep.
[554.92 → 555.34] I know.
[555.46 → 555.74] I know.
[556.12 → 557.74] PC Guy never stood a chance.
[557.74 → 558.32] Not an X.
[558.32 → 560.32] PCG170.
[560.32 → 565.38] So basically, allegedly, where are these even from?
[565.80 → 566.16] Texas.
[566.32 → 567.48] It was from Texas originally.
[567.64 → 568.36] It was from Texas.
[568.42 → 569.34] Let's see if they've got it.
[569.56 → 570.78] Let's see if they've got it pulled down.
[570.86 → 571.52] They do not.
[571.62 → 572.62] It is still up.
[572.76 → 575.76] It's still just they're just like, here, look at our balls.
[575.94 → 576.96] I feel like that's what it is.
[577.20 → 577.22] Yeah.
[578.16 → 578.74] They're just.
[578.98 → 579.30] They're just.
[579.30 → 579.58] Flashing their balls.
[579.58 → 579.86] Yeah.
[580.18 → 580.92] They're just chilling.
[580.92 → 582.40] You should hide those.
[582.50 → 583.14] Put that away.
[583.30 → 584.44] People aren't ready for that yet.
[584.44 → 593.98] You know, I mean, this is probably part of a much, much deeper conversation about the desperation of the web written media.
[595.32 → 604.58] Like, I mean, it's one thing to break an embargo with like, how do I how do I pick someone who wouldn't be offended?
[604.82 → 608.50] A data like nice people, great people, good product.
[608.50 → 615.28] But, you know, you could probably survive as a tech publication without being on the best of terms with them, though.
[615.94 → 623.10] But like giving the old middle finger to Intel, not in like an in like a criticizing their product way, because I'll do that.
[623.32 → 624.54] We're clearly down for that.
[624.64 → 630.20] But in like an in like a breaking a legally binding agreement that you signed with them way.
[630.20 → 636.96] There's a difference between like being overly friendly where you give like favourable reviews because you want like kickbacks or whatever.
[637.74 → 639.52] And breaking NDAs.
[639.52 → 640.98] Yeah, a little bit of professional respect.
[641.16 → 642.96] Breaking NDAs is just being a giant jerk.
[643.08 → 643.22] Yeah.
[643.26 → 644.82] And it's not just a jerk to the brand.
[644.92 → 646.74] It's also a jerk to all the other publications.
[646.98 → 647.62] All other publications.
[647.62 → 649.58] And in this case, Texas might not have signed an NDA.
[649.98 → 654.78] But they did that knowing they're going to find one under the table somewhere else.
[654.78 → 659.92] And they're going to screw over all the other guys that are working with Intel to get chips.
[660.06 → 669.32] Well, now like all other creators, whether it's text or video, will probably get at least a slice less views on their content when it comes out because of this.
[669.40 → 670.60] So it hurts other creators, too.
[670.66 → 674.26] You're being a jerk to all your friends, and you're being a jerk to whatever company that's in.
[674.72 → 676.22] Texas is legit, right?
[676.28 → 679.60] I mean, they're not blacklisted to my knowledge at all.
[679.80 → 680.96] They're not in good standing.
[680.96 → 681.32] Yeah.
[681.48 → 683.82] Like where did this information actually come from?
[683.82 → 684.88] That's the more interesting one.
[684.88 → 685.36] No, this is just Texas' review.
[685.36 → 689.42] Usually when you see this kind of thing, it's from some like second.
[689.90 → 691.38] WCCF tech, video cards.
[691.68 → 691.92] Yeah.
[692.12 → 692.30] Yeah.
[692.30 → 695.94] A publication that you know doesn't get invited to Intel's events anyway.
[696.14 → 699.00] They're not on the distribution list for samples or anything like that.
[699.10 → 700.14] So it's weird.
[700.38 → 701.02] Seems out of character, right?
[701.02 → 702.00] This seemed like something.
[702.12 → 704.06] I was like, wow, they're going to pull that down pretty quickly.
[704.42 → 706.80] But I'm really surprised it's still up.
[706.80 → 713.92] So anyway, I mean, generally the news is it'll be a 10 core 20 thread priced at $1,000.
[714.30 → 718.50] This is all allegedly because it's a rumour until my NDA expires.
[720.40 → 722.96] And it performs pretty good.
[723.10 → 723.90] Any thoughts?
[725.86 → 726.90] Good overclocking.
[726.98 → 728.62] I mean, that's good to know.
[729.06 → 729.36] Yeah.
[730.28 → 733.94] I'm curious to see how the 18 core is going to overclock though.
[734.56 → 734.74] Yeah.
[734.86 → 739.84] I would imagine like you're basically, you're going to be, it's going to come down to, yeah,
[740.04 → 743.94] overclocking is going to be on a core by core basis where you're going to actually have to
[743.94 → 750.12] spend a long time dialling in an overclock separately for one versus two versus four versus
[750.12 → 753.22] eight or 10 cores, depending on how the chip's being hit.
[753.22 → 759.78] You might need some motherboard software to, you know, hopefully Asus or someone like that
[759.78 → 762.50] develops some software that can handle that sort of thing very easily.
[762.50 → 766.38] Asus's BIOS has been doing that for years when you can set different ratios depending
[766.38 → 767.48] on how many cores are active.
[767.60 → 772.10] Just, I've never really bothered using it because there wasn't generally much difference
[772.10 → 776.56] between what you could do on two versus six cores.
[777.06 → 782.78] Whereas now we're talking about, you know, you can't be running 18 cores at 4.5 gigahertz
[782.78 → 785.40] all at the same time because it would, it would melt.
[785.84 → 791.00] I believe they have a software, uh, an operating system software that integrates as well, where
[791.00 → 795.54] it, it actively just looks at whatever executable you're running and then adjusts it based on
[795.54 → 795.76] that.
[795.82 → 797.22] So it makes a little bit more hands off.
[797.22 → 802.00] But can we talk honestly, would you install Asus software on your system?
[803.92 → 805.52] Well, remember, okay.
[805.94 → 806.34] Occasionally.
[807.22 → 807.82] What was it?
[808.06 → 809.02] 2013, 2014?
[809.24 → 810.80] How many issues we had with AI suite?
[811.62 → 811.84] Yeah.
[812.04 → 812.58] Was it 2012?
[812.78 → 813.24] I don't remember.
[813.40 → 815.42] AI suite is banned in this building.
[815.60 → 815.86] It is.
[816.32 → 817.90] Like, it might even be better now.
[818.18 → 823.50] But, like, here's all of the like, the black magic and spells you have to cast in order
[823.50 → 827.14] to uninstall it properly and actually get it completely removed from your system.
[827.50 → 827.80] Yeah.
[827.80 → 827.98] Yeah.
[828.12 → 828.32] Yeah.
[828.46 → 834.24] It's, uh, it, it's, it's usually installed on systems that I set up to test Asus, uh,
[834.24 → 838.68] like capabilities, like on an Asus motherboard, but not much beyond that on, on full-time,
[838.68 → 840.48] uh, systems that I use full-time.
[840.48 → 841.32] And how hard...
[841.32 → 842.24] I use installing it.
[842.24 → 847.28] How hard it can brick that install if you ever try to boot it on something else.
[847.64 → 849.18] Like, that's not an Asus board.
[849.42 → 852.30] And I'm just sitting here going, how deep are you putting your hooks in?
[852.42 → 853.08] Like, why?
[853.52 → 854.88] Why is this necessary?
[854.88 → 861.14] So, I'm just looking at some of the benchmark numbers on Hexes.
[862.32 → 866.62] So, as expected, it doesn't seem to have a massive impact on gaming.
[867.08 → 869.76] Um, you know, there's a little bit of fall-off.
[869.82 → 874.78] Actually, the Ry zen CPUs, uh, they're testing at 2560 by 1440, but the Ry zen CPUs are keeping
[874.78 → 875.40] up just fine.
[875.92 → 878.06] Uh, the eight core ones and the six core ones.
[879.12 → 883.06] 3DMark, I mean, it's just kind of that little incremental increase that you get up towards
[883.06 → 883.74] the top ends.
[883.74 → 884.28] Yeah.
[884.28 → 888.80] Uh, running VR Mark, which I haven't messed around with too much.
[889.12 → 889.86] Yeah, neither have I.
[890.22 → 890.64] Me neither.
[891.38 → 893.74] Uh, maybe, maybe, maybe a few years.
[895.48 → 897.78] Yeah, people are like, Luke's checking on the baby.
[897.88 → 899.10] No, Luke's not checking on the baby.
[899.44 → 900.98] My wife, Yvonne's got the baby.
[901.26 → 902.14] I'm definitely still here.
[902.20 → 902.36] Yeah.
[902.52 → 902.74] Yeah.
[902.88 → 904.14] That would be a bad send.
[904.50 → 906.90] Um, yeah, you're not in charge of the baby.
[907.10 → 907.42] No.
[908.54 → 909.38] All right.
[909.66 → 913.70] We've got another pretty big topic before we jump into, or do you guys just want to
[913.70 → 914.68] talk Scrapyard Wars now?
[915.44 → 916.96] Or do you want to do one more, one more topic?
[917.50 → 919.38] We're ready for your apology whenever you guys are.
[919.48 → 920.42] I mean, I know it's hard to.
[920.76 → 920.96] All right.
[921.02 → 921.78] Let's do another topic.
[921.78 → 921.96] I think.
[923.10 → 926.00] So this was originally posted by Wicked Paul on the forum.
[926.10 → 926.68] Different Paul.
[926.86 → 927.80] That's a Wicked Paul.
[927.96 → 929.74] You're like a flaccid Paul.
[930.52 → 931.80] It's not the same.
[931.80 → 936.54] I would, I would like to state that he's very much like Judy when he needs to be.
[936.54 → 942.60] Um, the CRTC, the Canadian Radio, Television, and Telecommunications Commission, just issued
[942.60 → 948.76] a ruling stating that cell phone service providers can't charge for phone unlocking,
[949.04 → 954.08] and that as of December 1st of this year, all new phones have to be sold unlocked.
[955.20 → 960.12] How much do you wish that your regulatory bodies cared about you that much?
[960.12 → 965.58] This is, this is a hard subject for us to talk about.
[965.96 → 968.28] Um, that's, that's awesome.
[968.46 → 970.18] I am super happy for you guys.
[970.50 → 970.66] Yeah.
[970.72 → 971.28] Go Canada.
[971.52 → 972.38] It's a frozen number 4K.
[972.44 → 974.04] You guys are always really nice.
[974.06 → 975.26] We're moving there soon, so.
[976.06 → 976.42] Yeah.
[977.32 → 977.80] Yeah.
[977.80 → 981.44] Um, I mean, this is, no, that's, that's really cool.
[981.44 → 989.06] How, how unfriendly a practice is this whole phone locking thing?
[989.24 → 990.62] Like, what the heck?
[991.04 → 995.40] You guys both bought Pixels, probably out of frustration with that practice, right?
[995.92 → 996.08] Yeah.
[996.18 → 998.06] I've been, I've been with Verizon, I think.
[998.26 → 1000.96] I had been with Verizon pretty much all my life.
[1000.96 → 1004.82] Like, ever since the first time I ever got a cell phone for like 10 years ago or whatever
[1004.82 → 1005.30] it was.
[1005.30 → 1011.18] And for the first time ever, I switched it over to AT&T just so I could buy an unlocked
[1011.18 → 1011.50] Pixel.
[1012.00 → 1015.20] That's what finally got me to switch because I was just sort of sick of it.
[1015.26 → 1018.16] You know, we've been doing more travelling, going to Computer and things like that.
[1018.22 → 1021.12] Just wanting to pop in a foreign SIM card would be nice.
[1021.30 → 1024.48] And I just couldn't believe that my options were so limited with Verizon.
[1024.72 → 1027.06] So it's, it is a big issue for a lot of us here.
[1027.36 → 1029.12] I'm very happy that this happened.
[1029.34 → 1033.68] To be, to be fair though, how many times did we use that site where it costs like $10 and
[1033.68 → 1034.44] you just unlock your phone?
[1034.44 → 1035.80] Well, it can cost more than that.
[1035.90 → 1037.48] Last time I did it, I paid like 30.
[1037.82 → 1038.18] Oh really?
[1038.26 → 1038.48] Yeah.
[1038.54 → 1039.14] It depends.
[1039.66 → 1043.40] I've done it like four or five times probably every time was under $10.
[1043.54 → 1046.70] More obscure models tend to require more.
[1046.92 → 1048.74] And sometimes you just like can't even do it.
[1049.22 → 1053.84] And Bell wanted, I think it was like $100 to unlock my old iPhone 4.
[1053.84 → 1058.74] Like back when we first started the company, and I was trying to use that as like a cheapo travel phone.
[1059.10 → 1061.10] And it's just like, it's so frustrating.
[1061.16 → 1065.78] And it's one of those things where like, I don't, you know, I don't fundamentally disagree
[1065.78 → 1075.02] with the, the general sort of right wing sentiment that regulating businesses and putting a bunch of,
[1075.02 → 1084.20] a bunch of red tape in place is destructive to businesses' abilities to be profitable and to grow and to,
[1084.20 → 1085.98] and to maintain themselves.
[1085.98 → 1094.82] But just the problem is that we've seen time and time again that no matter how unfriendly their practices are
[1094.82 → 1102.36] and how upset it makes their customers, they just, they just can't, they just can't be trusted with this.
[1102.36 → 1112.38] So, yeah, I guess I'm, I'm glad, I'm glad that they stepped in because this is one of those things
[1112.38 → 1117.42] where I think it's a pretty tough argument for the carriers to go like, oh, you are like adding,
[1117.72 → 1123.92] you're adding overhead, and you're putting strain on our business to maintain all these separate skews
[1123.92 → 1132.06] and to, and to maintain all this, all this bloatware and to, and to, to, no, if anything,
[1132.36 → 1135.26] we are regulating, simplifying things.
[1135.74 → 1135.88] Yeah.
[1136.34 → 1139.94] Well, it's just, it's just, it's just purely unfriendly to consumers.
[1140.20 → 1140.72] Exactly.
[1141.46 → 1146.66] Like, and, and like, there are obviously a lot of things that businesses will do that are unfriendly to consumers,
[1146.66 → 1150.20] but this is like very unnecessarily unfriendly to consumers.
[1150.20 → 1154.08] Yeah, well, it's purely to lock people into the contract.
[1154.36 → 1154.46] Yeah.
[1155.96 → 1161.66] So, uh, Canadian telecoms made a total of $37.7 million last year,
[1161.84 → 1163.90] charging customers to unlock their cell phones.
[1164.10 → 1164.34] Wow.
[1164.40 → 1165.74] That's a lot more than I would have expected.
[1166.02 → 1166.18] Yep.
[1166.18 → 1166.76] To be honest.
[1167.06 → 1171.82] Telecoms warned, this is great, that if they didn't charge an unlocking fee for the few customers who want it done,
[1171.96 → 1174.06] the cost would have to be passed on to everyone.
[1174.84 → 1178.62] So, uh, the CRTC was like, okay, well then let's just not have locked phones.
[1178.66 → 1179.48] That sounds great.
[1179.66 → 1180.10] Yeah.
[1180.20 → 1181.84] Then you don't have to charge anyone a fee ever.
[1181.88 → 1182.34] Problem solved.
[1182.34 → 1182.96] Brilliant solution.
[1183.20 → 1186.34] Look, look at all this administrative burden that we just lifted off of you.
[1186.40 → 1187.26] There are so many questions.
[1189.02 → 1193.36] I think I have to figure out a different way to make all of that money unnecessarily from people though.
[1193.56 → 1197.74] That's a big challenge for them, and they're probably going to have to charge more people more money in order to be able to do that.
[1199.48 → 1202.06] Okay, yeah, Colton wants us to do a spot for this shirt.
[1202.06 → 1204.18] No, I want Colton to do a spot for this shirt.
[1204.26 → 1205.50] Colton, get over here.
[1205.62 → 1206.72] I did not say that.
[1206.78 → 1207.44] Get over here.
[1207.56 → 1208.78] Talk about your stupid shirt.
[1208.78 → 1210.46] Isn't this from your stream?
[1210.68 → 1211.00] Yes.
[1211.00 → 1212.02] Okay, yeah.
[1212.08 → 1213.48] So then I asked Nitro.
[1213.58 → 1215.18] I was like, hey, you got any ideas?
[1215.34 → 1216.36] And then gave me this.
[1216.42 → 1224.20] And then there's a big argument whether we should have done the one Linus face in the middle or we should have done like multiple, like six.
[1224.20 → 1226.34] And then we went with four, thought it was a good mixture.
[1226.34 → 1227.18] I think four is pretty good.
[1227.26 → 1228.70] And then now we're selling them.
[1228.74 → 1229.50] We've sold a couple.
[1229.66 → 1230.32] So you can get yours now.
[1230.32 → 1231.26] How many have we sold?
[1231.32 → 1231.76] I'm curious.
[1232.18 → 1232.94] At least ten.
[1233.86 → 1234.52] Oh, okay.
[1234.74 → 1235.68] Austin Evans has one.
[1235.68 → 1236.52] One to Austin.
[1237.10 → 1238.16] One to Luke.
[1238.16 → 1240.66] That's 40 Linus faces.
[1240.96 → 1241.64] How many?
[1242.44 → 1243.00] Sorry.
[1243.24 → 1244.18] What's the URL?
[1244.66 → 1245.26] Designed by humans.
[1245.50 → 1246.34] Designed by humans.
[1246.50 → 1247.64] No, they sold ten Linus.
[1247.88 → 1248.16] Cool.
[1248.30 → 1249.30] Sold two and a half shirts.
[1250.46 → 1251.38] Pure cancer.
[1251.54 → 1251.82] All right.
[1251.88 → 1257.64] Speaking of pure cancer, you guys cheating at Scrapyard Wars.
[1257.64 → 1269.20] Okay, so there are a lot of our viewers who feel like I ripped a deserved victory away from you guys.
[1269.50 → 1270.88] How would you address that?
[1271.06 → 1273.76] Oh, so you read all the top comments on the last video of Scrapyard Wars.
[1273.82 → 1274.28] I did.
[1274.38 → 1274.80] I did.
[1274.86 → 1280.90] I do read the comments on videos because unlike you, I have a lot of positive comments on my videos that are nice to read.
[1281.02 → 1283.42] Maybe if you made better videos, you would like reading your comments too.
[1283.42 → 1286.32] Maybe if you stopped playing it safe and just stuck to the same routine all the time,
[1286.32 → 1288.28] and maybe you'd actually stir the pot once in a while.
[1288.28 → 1291.00] Yeah, like if you made this video about Intel's new processors,
[1291.32 → 1295.04] like you could have, you know, made it like sad and walked around in the rain
[1295.04 → 1299.48] and like actually given a heartfelt speech about what's going on with Intel.
[1299.74 → 1301.86] But I don't think you did.
[1302.22 → 1303.36] No, I didn't get that.
[1303.52 → 1305.04] Just you made the same serialized content.
[1305.04 → 1306.42] I was inspired by Jay's video.
[1306.54 → 1307.48] I was just copying him.
[1307.62 → 1307.80] Yeah.
[1308.62 → 1308.98] Before.
[1309.42 → 1309.78] Yeah.
[1309.78 → 1310.40] It's funny.
[1310.48 → 1314.78] Jay was on last week saying that like he had been planning to make that video,
[1314.78 → 1319.78] and he saw mine go up, and he's like, I'm just going to do it anyway.
[1321.10 → 1321.42] Anyway.
[1321.54 → 1321.74] Okay.
[1321.80 → 1322.00] Okay.
[1322.06 → 1322.28] Okay.
[1322.32 → 1324.34] So what, what say you, what say you?
[1324.74 → 1328.76] Because people seem to think that we're like upset at each other and that there's like bitterness.
[1329.30 → 1329.74] All right.
[1329.74 → 1336.82] So first off, I think we just want to point out that we in no way are here to drum up controversy.
[1336.82 → 1341.82] But if you guys want to argue about that and what we're here for in the comments,
[1341.98 → 1343.24] please feel free to go ahead and do so.
[1343.24 → 1351.76] The main point I think is that there was, I think there were problems with the following
[1351.76 → 1354.98] of the rules that happened on both sides.
[1354.98 → 1359.78] And I think the question in people's minds, because we're not, we're not, we're not denying
[1359.78 → 1360.04] that.
[1360.12 → 1363.72] We're not trying to come here and say like, we didn't cheat or like that hard drive that
[1363.72 → 1366.24] was in there was, we bought or anything like that.
[1366.48 → 1369.66] Well, you did buy it technically at some point.
[1369.66 → 1371.90] I might have, that might've been a sample.
[1371.98 → 1372.34] I'm not sure.
[1372.88 → 1375.32] But it's a sample zero dollar value.
[1375.66 → 1377.76] So we won't go down that route.
[1377.76 → 1379.42] It actually doesn't have anything to do with it.
[1380.02 → 1382.46] It's just no internal tools or parts.
[1382.54 → 1387.34] But yeah, I think, I think if people are upset, it's because that they saw that there were,
[1387.42 → 1391.46] was bending, if not breaking of the rules on both sides.
[1391.80 → 1396.34] And that if you were to negate those against each other and say they cancelled each other out
[1396.34 → 1402.94] and it just fell down to the strict performance of the systems, which in our case wouldn't
[1402.94 → 1409.38] have been affected at all by a hard drive, for example, that, that perhaps the, the higher
[1409.38 → 1414.36] scores and the more powerful system, uh, the RGBs, which is sitting behind us, and it's a
[1414.36 → 1415.64] nearly completed state.
[1415.64 → 1421.10] Paul, you're forgetting that the entire victory of this entire Scrapyard Wars 5 season was
[1421.10 → 1426.64] determined by an unbiased competitor of the actual contest.
[1426.80 → 1427.56] Oh wait, you're right.
[1427.66 → 1433.28] Actually, Jesus, I forgot that Linus was the one who actually made the final call as to who
[1433.28 → 1434.78] won Scrapyard Wars 5.
[1436.08 → 1437.92] The impartial, impartial.
[1437.92 → 1439.50] I apologize for that.
[1439.70 → 1440.00] Okay.
[1440.22 → 1440.54] Okay.
[1440.54 → 1451.78] So, so my side of this is that I was completely ready to concede defeat knowing that rules
[1451.78 → 1458.18] had already been bent, but not broken on both sides.
[1459.00 → 1463.24] Luke and I might have skirted close.
[1463.46 → 1464.96] Mr. Wears His Shirt.
[1464.96 → 1465.24] Okay.
[1465.34 → 1468.68] Look, I, what's the Luke and I part of this?
[1468.76 → 1469.68] What did I do?
[1469.88 → 1470.14] Okay.
[1470.28 → 1470.92] Hold on.
[1471.08 → 1479.42] You're, you're inherently, you're inherently along for your, your, your, I mean, okay, look,
[1479.50 → 1481.38] look, Luke, think about it this way.
[1481.38 → 1484.46] Just because you're cheating has an aura doesn't mean that it's my fault.
[1484.46 → 1490.62] If somebody's driving down a country road and baseball bats are being used to knock over
[1490.62 → 1493.76] mailboxes, I'm not saying that you hit the mailbox.
[1493.76 → 1495.40] I'm just saying you were in the car.
[1495.46 → 1495.76] Okay.
[1496.38 → 1499.56] Technically when we were in the car, there was no cheating going on.
[1499.62 → 1499.92] Okay.
[1500.02 → 1504.28] So anyway, anyway, anyway, so Luke and I are going to cover the logo with my bag.
[1505.34 → 1506.48] That's going to totally work.
[1506.48 → 1511.10] I legitimately only wear these shirts on work days because then I don't have to change
[1511.10 → 1512.08] my shirt when I'm filming.
[1512.08 → 1512.92] I know, but Scrapyard Wars is different.
[1513.08 → 1513.22] I know.
[1513.28 → 1514.18] Well, I didn't think of it.
[1514.48 → 1515.82] I'm not going to wear this shirt.
[1516.06 → 1517.66] I only packed these.
[1517.84 → 1518.94] So pack something else.
[1518.94 → 1519.18] I know.
[1519.30 → 1519.68] I didn't think of it.
[1519.68 → 1520.32] It's Scrapyard Wars.
[1520.64 → 1521.48] I didn't think of it.
[1521.50 → 1522.26] You should have walked in shirtless.
[1522.56 → 1523.36] I could have lent a shirt.
[1523.36 → 1523.76] I would have been better.
[1523.84 → 1524.04] Okay.
[1524.18 → 1524.42] Okay.
[1524.48 → 1530.54] Anyway, anyway, anyway, the point is, the point is, the negotiations had been done already
[1530.54 → 1535.02] with everyone that we talked to before we got there.
[1535.14 → 1535.74] So we should be.
[1536.16 → 1539.56] We technically didn't get special pricing from store dude.
[1540.32 → 1541.22] A lot of people thought we did.
[1541.22 → 1545.12] A lot of people thought we did, but he actually has a supervisor that he brings the parts
[1545.12 → 1546.18] to, and they ring it up.
[1546.32 → 1547.28] They had no idea who we were.
[1547.28 → 1553.10] What's even more obvious than your blatant shirt advertisement, Linus, even more obvious
[1553.10 → 1555.22] than that is your voice.
[1555.58 → 1557.86] Well, there's nothing I can do about that.
[1558.44 → 1561.48] You could have had Luke do the calling, which, you know.
[1561.48 → 1565.10] Next Scrapyard Wars, you need those voice modulators that you speak into, and it makes you sound
[1565.10 → 1566.04] like Darth Vader or something like that.
[1566.04 → 1570.22] I will admit, this Scrapyard Wars had an issue for me, which is that I drove, I think it
[1570.22 → 1573.74] was like 430 miles in three days or something.
[1574.24 → 1575.84] Like, I just, I drove.
[1576.16 → 1576.58] In LA.
[1576.78 → 1577.40] That was like.
[1577.40 → 1578.36] Maybe that's impossible in LA.
[1578.36 → 1578.56] Yeah.
[1578.70 → 1578.94] Yeah.
[1579.28 → 1583.18] That was like my job for this Scrapyard Wars was I drove.
[1583.84 → 1585.88] You also modded the front panel.
[1586.60 → 1586.88] Yeah.
[1587.00 → 1587.36] Oh, yeah.
[1587.68 → 1588.40] Partially incorrectly.
[1588.84 → 1589.10] Yes.
[1589.24 → 1589.78] Partially incorrectly.
[1589.78 → 1590.12] Yes.
[1590.24 → 1593.28] That didn't end up being what cost us, though, so I'll give you that.
[1593.28 → 1593.94] Yeah, not at all.
[1593.94 → 1594.82] That wasn't the problem.
[1594.82 → 1597.48] The horrible implementation of RGB is what ended up costing.
[1597.72 → 1598.90] Okay, that was on me.
[1600.22 → 1604.10] Although, when I was watching it back, you suggested it first.
[1604.74 → 1606.60] But then you changed your mind.
[1606.76 → 1609.08] No, it was 100% a joke.
[1609.74 → 1610.00] Okay.
[1610.16 → 1610.48] Okay.
[1610.58 → 1611.92] So anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway.
[1612.44 → 1615.04] So, and, okay, so there are a couple of things.
[1615.12 → 1619.66] Number one is the pricing from the place where we got the bulk of our hardware was actually
[1619.66 → 1622.08] determined by the cashier.
[1622.32 → 1624.72] There was a cashier and there was a supervisor that he had to call.
[1624.82 → 1624.98] Yes.
[1624.98 → 1626.70] There's two different people that he had to go through to get it.
[1626.70 → 1628.74] And the supervisor call wasn't in the video.
[1628.74 → 1633.54] So, in the defence of the audience who's like crying bloody murder about that.
[1633.90 → 1638.38] Number two is the people who are like, yeah, there's no way someone would let you come
[1638.38 → 1640.02] in and fish through things like that.
[1640.34 → 1640.86] You know what?
[1640.86 → 1647.42] Part of Scrapyard Wars is pushing the boundaries and finding ways to get people to make an exception
[1647.42 → 1647.94] for you.
[1648.02 → 1654.50] Whether that's making vague, kind of weird, sexual sounding promises by email.
[1655.24 → 1655.42] Kyle.
[1655.42 → 1658.12] I will give you rewards that you can't possibly imagine.
[1658.12 → 1662.32] Which had nothing to do with my influence as a YouTuber as that was never specified before
[1662.32 → 1664.24] the actual deal was locked into place.
[1664.36 → 1664.80] Sexual favours approved.
[1664.80 → 1668.52] And by the time I actually finally did exchange money for product.
[1668.52 → 1669.32] He had no idea.
[1669.40 → 1671.08] Who I was and who you were.
[1671.34 → 1673.38] He still had no effing idea who you were.
[1673.82 → 1674.46] So, okay.
[1674.80 → 1677.48] So, all that whole argument is completely invalid.
[1677.84 → 1680.38] The guy who gave the best deal of the entire thing.
[1680.62 → 1681.88] He had no idea who the hell we are.
[1682.40 → 1683.16] So, okay.
[1683.44 → 1683.84] So, anyway.
[1684.00 → 1686.02] But my point was, was that people are like, yeah.
[1686.02 → 1688.58] The only reason that guy let you do that was because of who you are.
[1688.62 → 1689.14] And you know what?
[1689.22 → 1692.38] It's possible that he let me do that because of who I was.
[1692.52 → 1695.62] But I wasn't the only one at the shop digging through stuff.
[1696.00 → 1697.50] And those people weren't me.
[1697.58 → 1698.38] There were other customers.
[1698.94 → 1700.48] And obviously we couldn't film them.
[1700.72 → 1701.80] Multiple other customers.
[1701.80 → 1704.32] And going way back.
[1704.56 → 1706.22] Like 15 years ago.
[1706.44 → 1708.32] That's legitimately where they show people things.
[1708.58 → 1710.12] Also to be clear about that part.
[1710.26 → 1714.56] The first time I ever like took over the tech area in a shop.
[1714.56 → 1718.54] Was at the Vancouver NCI 15 years ago as a customer.
[1718.80 → 1721.30] I came in because I had a motherboard RMA to do.
[1721.48 → 1724.88] And I didn't have the hardware that I needed to swap out and troubleshoot it.
[1724.98 → 1726.14] So, I brought in my board.
[1726.20 → 1728.20] And they were like, we can't do anything for you for a week.
[1728.24 → 1729.60] I was like, that's unacceptable.
[1729.80 → 1730.94] I have to play video games.
[1731.40 → 1732.86] Look, can I just borrow some hardware?
[1732.98 → 1734.46] Can I set up a spot on a bench here?
[1734.64 → 1736.98] And can I just swap things out and diagnose this?
[1737.02 → 1740.80] And they're like, sure.
[1740.80 → 1747.06] You'd be amazed what people will let you do if you just ask.
[1747.20 → 1748.96] And if you're willing to do all of it.
[1749.14 → 1750.32] If they don't have to do anything.
[1750.52 → 1752.18] And if they know that you're Linus Tech Tips.
[1752.36 → 1754.02] No, but I wasn't Linus Tech Tips.
[1754.08 → 1754.76] That's my point.
[1755.24 → 1756.40] His name was Ash Ketchum.
[1756.40 → 1757.18] You look like you're going.
[1757.28 → 1757.54] Yes.
[1757.78 → 1758.54] Ash Ketchum.
[1759.06 → 1761.24] I'm Linus Tech Tips fan because of the shirt.
[1761.30 → 1761.90] So, anyway.
[1762.04 → 1763.58] Going back to the judging.
[1763.58 → 1765.10] So, I was fully ready.
[1765.22 → 1768.56] Knowing you guys had bent rules of your own.
[1768.56 → 1770.34] Like splitting up, for example.
[1770.34 → 1770.62] Thank you, Evan.
[1772.08 → 1773.28] That was never made up front.
[1773.62 → 1774.14] That was never.
[1774.14 → 1774.66] That was actually.
[1775.00 → 1775.26] That was.
[1775.26 → 1777.38] Easel told us straight up that we could do that.
[1777.50 → 1777.90] No problem.
[1777.90 → 1780.18] So, Easel was screwing with you.
[1780.32 → 1782.50] Because people were watching our side of it going.
[1782.74 → 1785.76] Why do these two go everywhere together like a husband and wife?
[1786.72 → 1787.94] Because we wouldn't have done that.
[1787.94 → 1788.98] Because that's the rules.
[1788.98 → 1791.92] I wouldn't have had to spend the entire competition driving.
[1792.38 → 1794.14] You guys did argue like a married couple.
[1794.42 → 1795.72] Which is classic.
[1795.72 → 1797.28] We are a married couple.
[1797.60 → 1798.30] Get over it.
[1798.30 → 1800.90] We're under the complete impression that that was not.
[1801.10 → 1804.54] There was no rule that we had to always stay together or anything like that.
[1804.54 → 1805.96] I don't think that was ever discussed up front.
[1805.98 → 1806.12] Yeah.
[1806.18 → 1808.56] I don't think that was laid out first.
[1808.56 → 1808.84] Okay.
[1808.96 → 1809.18] Okay.
[1809.30 → 1809.46] Well, anyway.
[1809.46 → 1811.32] We technically have it on camera.
[1811.60 → 1811.90] So, like.
[1811.94 → 1812.20] Anyway.
[1812.32 → 1812.62] Anyway.
[1812.74 → 1812.94] Anyway.
[1813.12 → 1813.84] So, so, so.
[1813.92 → 1814.24] So, anyway.
[1814.44 → 1817.48] But the point is that's not the only rule that was bent on your side either.
[1817.62 → 1818.58] Rules were bent.
[1819.42 → 1819.70] But.
[1820.14 → 1821.28] Where the rules were.
[1821.30 → 1823.04] See, I would say we only broke.
[1823.04 → 1825.08] We broke the rule with the hard drive.
[1825.68 → 1826.44] The other rules.
[1826.44 → 1828.82] I would argue that we did not bend.
[1828.96 → 1829.68] What about the money one?
[1830.04 → 1830.92] Not even a bend.
[1831.30 → 1833.02] You, you can even tell after you guys are.
[1833.22 → 1836.42] After Linus is done rummaging through that warehouse.
[1836.96 → 1837.66] And by the way.
[1837.72 → 1840.82] I feel like you guys were still striking up a few little deals.
[1840.82 → 1844.48] Long after you had arrived and met the guy, Michael, face to face.
[1844.48 → 1845.80] Like, how much for this fan?
[1845.88 → 1846.42] Five dollars.
[1846.88 → 1848.38] But you're going to charge me five dollars for this fan?
[1848.38 → 1849.80] He told me free first.
[1849.80 → 1849.82] Oh, no.
[1849.82 → 1850.74] Yeah, you can take it.
[1850.74 → 1851.34] You can take it.
[1851.34 → 1851.48] You can take it.
[1851.56 → 1851.76] Okay.
[1851.96 → 1853.24] A lot of this happened off camera.
[1853.32 → 1854.58] But he told me it was free.
[1854.74 → 1855.40] And then I was like.
[1855.82 → 1856.06] Oh.
[1856.18 → 1857.52] You know this is a Peñaflor, right?
[1857.78 → 1859.16] These are worth like 25 bucks.
[1859.56 → 1859.80] Okay.
[1859.92 → 1861.22] But even, even so.
[1861.34 → 1861.76] And I was like.
[1861.86 → 1863.22] You cannot charge me for something.
[1863.22 → 1864.58] I told him you can't.
[1865.12 → 1868.44] You can't charge me for something that you didn't know was worth anything until I told
[1868.44 → 1869.30] you it was worth something.
[1869.54 → 1870.44] That was my point.
[1870.50 → 1872.50] And we didn't end up using the fan anyway, by the way.
[1872.50 → 1873.20] But you know what?
[1873.24 → 1874.50] You know what said it all for me, though?
[1874.70 → 1878.08] It wasn't even any dialogue or action that had transpired.
[1878.20 → 1881.78] It was after you guys left that warehouse, and you're walking back to the car.
[1882.62 → 1886.68] The look and just the overall expression on Luke's face.
[1887.32 → 1889.10] It's like you guys had done something.
[1889.42 → 1891.12] Like you had murdered a child.
[1891.12 → 1893.42] And you were trying to get away with it.
[1893.78 → 1897.08] Told me everything that wasn't shown on camera.
[1897.74 → 1899.00] Whatever you want to say.
[1899.52 → 1901.96] Luke, I've never seen Luke so in distress.
[1902.82 → 1903.14] You just.
[1904.14 → 1905.54] I didn't like the.
[1905.64 → 1908.66] I did not like that they knew who Linus was.
[1909.06 → 1909.94] That bothered me.
[1910.00 → 1911.10] And I didn't like it either.
[1911.46 → 1912.68] But again.
[1912.70 → 1913.08] That's funny.
[1913.10 → 1915.40] So we had talked to him multiple times on the phone.
[1915.40 → 1920.00] And the deal we ended up with actually wasn't quite as good as what he agreed to in our
[1920.00 → 1922.06] initial phone call and forgot about.
[1923.04 → 1924.98] So that's another key factor.
[1925.50 → 1927.50] Going way back to our first phone call.
[1927.62 → 1928.88] He was like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1928.92 → 1929.24] We can.
[1929.52 → 1930.68] We got all kinds of stuff.
[1930.74 → 1931.24] It's amazing.
[1931.34 → 1932.16] This place is amazing.
[1932.26 → 1932.78] We showed up there.
[1932.84 → 1934.54] They had like one CPU.
[1935.12 → 1939.68] Like the place actually wasn't as good as what was kind of sold to us.
[1939.68 → 1941.68] All right.
[1941.68 → 1949.30] I think he's like trying to make this like gaming parts sales outfit out of that shop.
[1950.62 → 1951.64] Because he's like trying.
[1951.70 → 1953.64] Because his boss didn't do that before.
[1954.18 → 1954.32] Yeah.
[1954.38 → 1955.68] They didn't care about the gaming parts.
[1955.76 → 1958.32] They just wanted to resell all the like business PCs.
[1958.82 → 1958.96] Yeah.
[1959.48 → 1962.16] Like workstations and office computers and stuff like that.
[1962.18 → 1966.38] So I think he was trying to get us in their pretty hard because he's like trying to show
[1966.38 → 1968.50] his boss that there are customers for this at all.
[1969.24 → 1969.48] So.
[1969.78 → 1970.18] Okay.
[1970.44 → 1970.76] Okay.
[1974.02 → 1974.50] Yeah.
[1974.64 → 1976.08] So that's my defence.
[1976.20 → 1988.04] So the one clear and obvious just red card violation of the rules then was using your own
[1988.04 → 1988.56] hardware.
[1989.98 → 1990.50] Yes.
[1990.50 → 1992.04] That was why.
[1992.04 → 1997.08] And you guys and this is something that we also aren't shown on camera that Luke
[1997.08 → 2001.16] and I will be pulling the footage out of the archives and showing it at our LTX expo
[2001.16 → 2006.80] that at the time you guys fully accepted the referee's decision.
[2006.96 → 2008.42] And it's only now you're fighting it.
[2008.48 → 2009.50] You guys are fighting it.
[2012.82 → 2016.90] This is because we had not seen your half of the show.
[2016.90 → 2017.26] Exactly.
[2017.26 → 2022.94] We didn't see any of the collusion that was going on between you and the sellers of hardware
[2022.94 → 2024.18] through who you were.
[2024.40 → 2024.80] Collusion.
[2024.98 → 2028.00] Our cheat was found out on the spot.
[2028.18 → 2034.14] Your cheat was found out a month or two, several months after the whole series had already
[2034.14 → 2036.88] been shot, edited, and posted to the public.
[2037.18 → 2042.24] So we gave you guys the benefit of the doubt assuming well they would never do something.
[2042.24 → 2043.34] Your hands are totally clean.
[2043.34 → 2045.40] The only two scratch jars one through four.
[2045.52 → 2047.68] He kept it super clean for five though.
[2048.38 → 2049.84] Stand-up guy that Linus.
[2052.66 → 2055.64] You also have to consider that Easel's the one that edited this.
[2056.04 → 2056.44] Yes.
[2056.50 → 2056.90] That's true.
[2057.38 → 2060.60] And he's a bit of a troublemaker and a bit of a pot stirrer.
[2061.56 → 2062.84] Well pot stirring, you know what?
[2062.94 → 2068.08] In Easel's defence, pot stirring gets views and creates situations like this which are interesting
[2068.08 → 2068.50] to watch.
[2068.54 → 2068.80] Okay.
[2069.34 → 2070.22] So I'll tell you what guys.
[2070.22 → 2071.14] Reality TV 101.
[2071.14 → 2073.60] Let's leave it up to the audience.
[2074.32 → 2075.46] We ran a straw poll.
[2077.50 → 2085.10] It's the most infallible way of determining any dispute.
[2085.42 → 2086.08] Straw poll.
[2087.28 → 2088.70] It's closer than I'd like.
[2089.12 → 2094.56] In their defence, I think they also ran a straw poll, and they won on theirs by a lot more
[2094.56 → 2095.50] than we won on ours.
[2095.62 → 2096.12] That's true.
[2096.42 → 2096.62] Okay.
[2096.68 → 2096.84] Yeah.
[2096.84 → 2099.72] But their viewers hadn't heard both sides of the story.
[2100.02 → 2100.96] That's also true.
[2100.96 → 2104.50] They had viewed the entire four episodes.
[2104.56 → 2104.82] Yes.
[2104.88 → 2108.14] But they hadn't experienced all four episodes.
[2109.14 → 2111.46] No one's experienced the proper outro.
[2111.68 → 2113.84] Votes are rolling in fast now.
[2113.92 → 2114.36] IMAX?
[2114.36 → 2115.92] Votes are rolling in fast now.
[2115.98 → 2116.56] I'm going in quickly.
[2116.56 → 2118.12] That would be freaking awesome.
[2118.12 → 2118.14] That would be freaking awesome.
[2118.14 → 2123.10] Like renting out an IMAX and just playing like a marathon of the entire season.
[2123.10 → 2124.02] That would be pretty cool.
[2124.08 → 2126.06] That would actually be a really fun like event.
[2126.74 → 2130.42] Speaking of events, do you guys have any interest in coming up here for LTX?
[2131.58 → 2132.12] When is that?
[2132.12 → 2133.20] I don't remember.
[2133.64 → 2134.76] Oh no, we're falling down.
[2134.98 → 2135.20] Oh.
[2135.66 → 2136.24] Oh God.
[2137.94 → 2140.68] Oh, we're getting close.
[2140.80 → 2141.70] We're in four points.
[2141.96 → 2142.12] Yeah.
[2142.22 → 2143.94] We're getting up there towards four points.
[2144.00 → 2147.62] Anyway, you guys don't have to commit or anything, but I think it's in August, I'm going to say.
[2147.70 → 2148.10] Is it in August?
[2148.42 → 2149.24] I thought it was end of July.
[2149.24 → 2149.94] I can't remember.
[2150.06 → 2150.34] You know what?
[2150.38 → 2151.38] It's on the hold on.
[2151.44 → 2153.76] I'm going to navigate away from there for a second.
[2153.76 → 2155.12] What are you guys doing there?
[2155.30 → 2156.30] July 29th.
[2156.30 → 2157.06] July 29th.
[2157.34 → 2159.36] Basically, it's a tech carnival.
[2161.10 → 2161.58] Okay.
[2161.98 → 2164.14] Yeah, so it's a con and it's a carnival.
[2164.50 → 2167.98] So we actually have like game against Easel in CSGO.
[2168.26 → 2170.46] So we have like actual like gaming focus booths.
[2170.46 → 2174.64] We have like Luke's running like a VR thing where people can just like try VR if they haven't, which is cool.
[2175.30 → 2179.22] But then we also have like a bungee run where you just like run as far as you're going to be able to do.
[2179.24 → 2179.72] As far as you can.
[2179.94 → 2182.54] And then like a bungee cord, you stretch it as far as you can.
[2182.58 → 2184.60] And then it like rips you back into like a big cushion.
[2185.44 → 2187.26] But you have to do it in socks and sandals, right?
[2187.64 → 2188.26] No, no.
[2188.34 → 2190.22] I don't even think you're allowed to wear sandals on it.
[2190.34 → 2192.68] So we've got a case toss.
[2193.08 → 2194.02] So we are doing the case toss.
[2194.56 → 2198.26] I believe even if we don't find a sponsor for the case toss, I don't even care.
[2198.32 → 2198.88] We're just going to do it.
[2199.00 → 2199.36] Okay, yeah.
[2199.40 → 2200.68] Because I've had so many questions.
[2200.82 → 2205.54] Like one case brand was like, oh, oh, why would we want anyone to do that?
[2205.86 → 2207.52] Why would we want someone to damage our case?
[2207.52 → 2211.60] I'm like, who cares?
[2211.72 → 2213.32] Obviously, it's not about that.
[2213.86 → 2215.66] Buy another company's cases.
[2215.80 → 2219.46] I know I can say there's a Thermal take.
[2219.70 → 2222.86] Their offices are near here, and I've gone through there.
[2223.02 → 2223.26] Yeah.
[2223.26 → 2229.48] And they have two dumpsters in the back that are just full of dead cases.
[2229.86 → 2230.42] Case graveyard.
[2230.60 → 2230.78] Yeah.
[2230.78 → 2234.92] That they decided they apparently can't even use for scrap or anything, and they're just
[2234.92 → 2235.50] all dead cases.
[2235.50 → 2235.92] I don't even.
[2236.18 → 2237.12] Like that's not even the issue.
[2237.24 → 2241.46] They just got like offended that we would think that they would be okay with someone throwing
[2241.46 → 2242.18] their product.
[2243.08 → 2243.54] Just like it.
[2243.54 → 2246.66] Those are the type of vendors you want to market to, or you're not showing.
[2246.66 → 2246.68] You're not showing.
[2248.30 → 2248.70] Clearly.
[2249.40 → 2249.52] Yeah.
[2250.16 → 2250.50] Oh, no.
[2250.68 → 2251.24] Ask Josh.
[2251.36 → 2251.76] Ask Tackle Josh.
[2251.76 → 2252.00] Oh, right.
[2252.10 → 2252.74] I forgot about that.
[2252.84 → 2254.96] Tackle Josh would be totally going to blow up a case or something.
[2255.06 → 2255.38] Oh, yeah.
[2255.50 → 2257.54] He's shotgunned one before, right?
[2257.70 → 2260.36] He shoots up his cases with high-powered.
[2261.06 → 2261.46] Wow.
[2261.46 → 2262.76] This is kind of incredible.
[2262.98 → 2264.82] We have twice as many votes now.
[2264.92 → 2266.08] Maybe more than twice as many votes.
[2266.48 → 2268.34] And it stayed exactly the same.
[2270.18 → 2273.92] That's exactly where you want to be when it comes to the controversy.
[2276.00 → 2277.84] It's getting the controversy eyeballs.
[2277.96 → 2280.68] How's your scrapyard wars machine back there doing, by the way?
[2280.82 → 2281.84] Is that part of your set now?
[2282.42 → 2282.68] Yeah.
[2283.04 → 2289.62] Well, it's great to finally be able to like to have it out there for people to see and everything.
[2290.30 → 2291.36] Hiding it for like.
[2291.36 → 2292.12] Three months.
[2292.20 → 2295.68] I'm sorry that your guys' build isn't available anymore.
[2296.50 → 2300.32] I would have expected that if you put so much time and effort into it, you're proud of it.
[2300.36 → 2303.16] You would want to keep it for, you know, as a memento or whatever.
[2303.62 → 2309.94] But, you know, since you guys left most of the bulk of it here, I believe it ended up in the recycle bin.
[2310.08 → 2310.82] In the recycle bin.
[2310.92 → 2311.76] Yeah, that's fine.
[2311.82 → 2312.18] I understand.
[2312.60 → 2313.42] That's probably fair.
[2313.54 → 2314.16] I understand.
[2314.28 → 2314.80] I understand.
[2315.34 → 2318.40] Luke's Drexel work was, I did take some pictures of it.
[2318.40 → 2322.28] Okay, that would have been good if you had a reinforced blade.
[2322.72 → 2323.10] I did.
[2323.20 → 2323.34] All right.
[2323.38 → 2324.96] So I did find my reinforced blades.
[2325.38 → 2330.56] But that was another thing that I just couldn't believe, especially watching the episode.
[2330.56 → 2334.24] So it's like, I have a sawmill right there.
[2334.36 → 2334.70] Okay.
[2334.84 → 2335.24] Okay.
[2335.46 → 2335.74] Okay.
[2335.76 → 2336.34] Right there.
[2336.54 → 2336.82] Now.
[2336.94 → 2338.82] And I have metal cutting blades for it.
[2339.14 → 2340.56] And I have my...
[2340.56 → 2343.64] What else do I have?
[2343.64 → 2346.06] I have my other saw over there too.
[2346.82 → 2347.54] Yeah, there it is.
[2347.60 → 2348.24] That was easy.
[2348.92 → 2349.12] Wow.
[2349.12 → 2351.92] You're going to do an internal hole on a panel.
[2351.92 → 2352.72] Yeah, come on.
[2352.80 → 2353.30] A window?
[2353.76 → 2355.66] You would cut out a window with that.
[2356.28 → 2356.80] Get real.
[2357.46 → 2358.14] Get real.
[2358.36 → 2358.82] And, okay.
[2358.82 → 2363.02] I'm just saying, if you lost your cutting disc, and you were like, there's nothing you...
[2363.02 → 2364.52] Because that's what you guys said at the time.
[2364.54 → 2365.76] One, I didn't see that.
[2365.88 → 2366.80] Two, you're going to do...
[2366.80 → 2367.84] How are you going to do that?
[2367.94 → 2369.34] How are you going to do an internal window with a saw?
[2369.34 → 2373.44] Three, in response to all the viewers who were like, there's a hacksaw right behind you.
[2373.76 → 2375.02] We had like 18 minutes.
[2375.48 → 2375.72] Yeah.
[2375.96 → 2377.34] We had like 18 minutes.
[2377.42 → 2380.30] They're like, yeah, wrap electrical tape around a hacksaw blade and go ham.
[2380.64 → 2383.02] Like, it's steel and we have 18 minutes.
[2384.10 → 2384.92] My jigsaw though.
[2385.08 → 2387.08] There's a jigsaw on the shelf right there.
[2387.08 → 2387.94] Even the jigsaw.
[2388.02 → 2389.92] That would have been a pretty rough hole.
[2390.06 → 2391.56] Like, if you're not using a rotary...
[2391.56 → 2392.56] It would have done it.
[2392.80 → 2394.36] Well, it would have cut through it.
[2394.36 → 2401.04] It's tough to get like really clean cuts even with a Drexel though.
[2401.18 → 2401.74] No, it's not.
[2402.38 → 2404.48] I like actually do that all the time.
[2406.06 → 2406.34] Yeah.
[2406.60 → 2408.68] You don't need to do any finishing on the edging?
[2408.88 → 2411.76] Like, you don't do any filing or anything like that?
[2411.86 → 2417.04] Without a file, if you angle the blade and use the flat part of the blade, you can still file it down that way.
[2417.32 → 2418.26] Luke's cheating.
[2418.40 → 2419.96] I've actually done this like a lot.
[2419.96 → 2422.22] I do believe you're there.
[2422.30 → 2423.32] Actually, MNPC Tech.
[2423.50 → 2428.02] They have an old school video on doing that where he goes over that technique and everything.
[2428.24 → 2429.70] So, I do believe you're there.
[2429.86 → 2438.96] And honestly, I do wish that I had remembered at the time when my cutting blades were because that wasn't something that I had intentionally like wanted to keep away from the guys.
[2438.96 → 2439.40] Okay.
[2440.12 → 2442.40] We wouldn't have won the RGB part anyway.
[2442.54 → 2442.76] No.
[2443.08 → 2443.86] No, you wouldn't have.
[2443.96 → 2445.78] Ours was way cooler than ours was.
[2445.78 → 2445.86] Okay.
[2446.34 → 2449.32] We would have felt even better because it wouldn't have been like, wow.
[2449.32 → 2450.82] We obviously should win this.
[2450.90 → 2452.12] It would have been like, wow, that was close.
[2452.38 → 2453.42] Our plan with the windows.
[2453.42 → 2454.20] I don't think it would have been close.
[2454.38 → 2455.62] I think you still would have destroyed them.
[2455.64 → 2462.90] Our plan with the windows was to have the windows, and then we were just going to take literally the pile of RGB lighting and just throw it in the case.
[2463.32 → 2465.60] So, like, it wasn't actually going to be a lot better.
[2465.70 → 2471.86] We were going for like a hashtag irony, like cancer implementation of it in the first place.
[2472.02 → 2472.62] RGB cancer.
[2472.62 → 2476.38] It was just supposed to be a slightly more sensible one.
[2477.40 → 2478.68] The RGB protests.
[2478.84 → 2480.74] Make it super ironic over the top.
[2480.94 → 2481.80] Yes, exactly.
[2481.96 → 2482.76] That was kind of the idea.
[2482.76 → 2486.50] Jay really likes that kind of dark take on things too, so that probably would have played well with him.
[2486.72 → 2486.86] Yeah.
[2486.96 → 2493.00] I mean, although we couldn't have competed with, again, more rule bending, the bribes that some people had for the judges.
[2493.00 → 2496.46] Which really held no weight in the end.
[2496.60 → 2499.00] We didn't even present it.
[2499.00 → 2500.20] I don't even think of it enough showing.
[2500.20 → 2503.14] We meant to have that there with our system, but that didn't work out for whatever reason.
[2503.34 → 2504.66] So we had to present that later on.
[2504.66 → 2507.74] That was 5% from England, though, so we couldn't just leave that.
[2507.92 → 2514.44] Yeah, it wasn't, but if it was included in the money that they had for the event, that's actually completely okay.
[2514.44 → 2516.82] Then it would have been completely above board.
[2516.96 → 2517.18] Yes.
[2517.46 → 2518.22] Oh, yeah.
[2518.40 → 2519.24] That's technically a thing.
[2519.34 → 2521.38] You could bribe the judge.
[2521.38 → 2521.90] Yes.
[2521.96 → 2524.62] It would just have to come from money that was for your computer.
[2525.42 → 2526.16] I have.
[2526.34 → 2526.86] What was it?
[2526.86 → 2529.86] You bought candy for the Tech Showdown, the gaming one.
[2530.18 → 2530.58] Scrapyard?
[2530.66 → 2531.28] Scrapyard Wars.
[2531.40 → 2534.46] All we have to do is give all the budget money to the judge up front.
[2534.58 → 2535.52] Like, we don't even need a system.
[2536.06 → 2537.48] Can you just declare us the winner?
[2537.68 → 2538.52] Here are 500 dollars in cash.
[2538.86 → 2543.16] Well, as long as you only want 10% of the possible score, then yes.
[2544.24 → 2545.88] Then that would work out perfectly.
[2547.00 → 2547.92] Damn those rules.
[2548.14 → 2550.18] And you had a judge with very poor morals.
[2550.18 → 2558.22] Was anyone else blown away when they saw viewers being like, what are you guys talking about, March?
[2558.92 → 2561.06] Was this really filmed like three months ago?
[2562.94 → 2563.46] Yes.
[2563.64 → 2564.06] What do you mean?
[2564.10 → 2567.22] If you see a 10-minute video, it clearly takes 10 minutes to make.
[2567.30 → 2568.82] It was done 10 minutes ago.
[2568.82 → 2577.44] I enjoyed all the people giving me advice after like the first one or two episodes had aired of how we should go about doing things next.
[2577.44 → 2584.00] I got some tweets and I saw some comments like, oh, you guys should do this.
[2584.10 → 2584.92] The next time you do this.
[2584.92 → 2586.08] Whatever, then you can totally win.
[2586.08 → 2590.46] I had a few people trying to give me suggestions on where to buy things.
[2590.68 → 2593.76] And like actually perfect ones.
[2593.86 → 2596.48] I was just like, I can't use this anymore.
[2596.48 → 2599.06] I had someone who was like really positive.
[2599.34 → 2601.48] Like they were like, they had my back.
[2601.82 → 2604.08] Someone else was criticizing something about the show.
[2604.46 → 2606.72] And they were like, well, you know what?
[2606.76 → 2608.44] It's really expensive to produce.
[2608.54 → 2616.36] I mean, you know, with a week in between, they've got to be like flying up and down all the time between their studio in LA to make their other videos.
[2616.36 → 2618.80] And I'm just like, oh, dude, I appreciate it.
[2618.82 → 2620.54] But like, no.
[2620.56 → 2621.48] Oh, yeah, I saw that coming.
[2621.56 → 2621.92] It was Luke.
[2626.16 → 2626.56] Yeah.
[2626.84 → 2627.12] Yeah.
[2627.22 → 2629.96] No, no, that isn't how it works.
[2631.04 → 2632.64] Oh, anyway.
[2632.70 → 2634.14] We tried to fly up and down.
[2634.28 → 2637.94] Someone's suggesting in Twitch chat that we do a follow-up to this.
[2638.36 → 2641.70] Just like as a like a score settler.
[2641.90 → 2642.20] Okay.
[2642.78 → 2644.20] Where there's no budget.
[2644.32 → 2644.60] Oh, my.
[2644.60 → 2648.94] You only get to use your YouTube fame to acquire parts.
[2651.42 → 2653.80] We have actually considered it.
[2654.08 → 2655.22] Yes, we have considered it.
[2655.24 → 2655.96] Just give me something.
[2656.24 → 2658.94] I mean, that would probably work to some degree.
[2659.18 → 2659.34] Yeah.
[2660.84 → 2662.86] Just all the review samples you've ever gotten.
[2663.22 → 2665.10] I would feel so weird doing that.
[2665.18 → 2665.78] Be like, hey.
[2666.08 → 2667.04] It's actually new stuff.
[2667.56 → 2669.94] I get hardware for free all the time.
[2670.08 → 2671.20] Please give me something.
[2671.20 → 2672.08] You should give me something.
[2673.08 → 2674.02] It would be terrible.
[2674.02 → 2678.08] But I'm sure there would be people who would be happy to do it.
[2678.18 → 2680.46] You know if they get a shout-out and all that kind of stuff.
[2680.56 → 2680.62] Yeah.
[2680.62 → 2681.12] Which is awesome.
[2681.40 → 2682.04] Ego wars.
[2683.08 → 2683.92] Ego wars.
[2683.92 → 2687.70] I don't know.
[2687.70 → 2690.76] Luke and I have actually discussed that concept before.
[2690.76 → 2692.76] With some pretty detailed specifics.
[2692.76 → 2694.32] And the reason we didn't do it.
[2694.32 → 2701.34] Because ultimately it would just end up being who can build the best rig with, at that time,
[2701.50 → 2708.98] 6950Xs, dual Titan XPs, 128 gigs of RAM, and a massive SSD RAID array.
[2708.98 → 2710.42] You're going to get it all.
[2710.42 → 2712.70] That's the problem with it.
[2712.90 → 2716.16] Because they're just going to be like, okay, give it back to me when the show's done.
[2716.28 → 2717.84] Because we had even talked about it.
[2719.52 → 2723.48] Because remember, we didn't tell you guys what the challenge was going to be until we got there.
[2723.48 → 2728.54] Because we didn't decide until we were sitting in the airplane waiting for our connection.
[2728.66 → 2729.20] Or in the airplane.
[2729.28 → 2731.44] In the airport waiting for our connection on our way down there.
[2731.74 → 2732.96] And we were like, okay, what should we do?
[2733.02 → 2734.38] And that was one of the ones we pitched.
[2734.46 → 2736.90] I was like, oh, they're down in the city of industry area.
[2737.38 → 2739.96] So literally every tech brand is there.
[2739.96 → 2743.26] Why don't we do, use whatever connections you want.
[2743.42 → 2744.66] Get whatever you can.
[2744.80 → 2748.64] To cap off the like ego wars, like ego wars idea.
[2748.64 → 2754.06] You could have like, like state the area that the judging is going to happen.
[2754.44 → 2754.66] Yeah.
[2754.80 → 2759.56] And then just get a totalled average out of all the fans that show up.
[2760.60 → 2763.48] So it's like literally just an ego competition.
[2763.74 → 2766.16] Like you can post the benchmarking results and everything.
[2766.28 → 2769.40] But they get to decide which one they like think is better.
[2769.46 → 2773.02] See, the problem is that I am for some reason so unpopular.
[2773.24 → 2774.24] Can't imagine why.
[2775.10 → 2778.24] That whenever it is a popularity contest.
[2778.24 → 2781.94] So because you might lose, you're not okay with doing it at all.
[2782.14 → 2782.50] Yes.
[2783.08 → 2785.46] Which is exactly why I'm so unpopular.
[2786.46 → 2787.82] That's risk management right there.
[2787.88 → 2788.96] Oh my goodness.
[2789.38 → 2790.02] Oh man.
[2790.40 → 2790.70] All right.
[2790.74 → 2792.88] You guys did say you had to go after half an hour.
[2792.96 → 2793.64] Do you have to go?
[2794.76 → 2799.34] We can hang out for a few more minutes if you guys have more interesting stuff to talk about.
[2799.46 → 2801.62] Well, we're running right up against our sponsor spots.
[2801.62 → 2803.62] So we were thinking we kind of had to do that.
[2803.62 → 2809.46] So if that's a good time for us to cut out, then that would be okay with us.
[2810.18 → 2810.90] Okay, sure.
[2811.02 → 2811.72] Well, okay.
[2811.78 → 2815.06] So once more, thank you guys for being part of the whole thing.
[2815.16 → 2819.16] I hope it was legitimately fun, even though you only got a consolation prize.
[2819.82 → 2820.92] We had a good time.
[2821.00 → 2822.64] As much as we hate to admit it.
[2822.74 → 2823.46] It was fun.
[2823.60 → 2824.14] We enjoyed it.
[2824.14 → 2825.44] Discovery Wars is genuinely really fun.
[2825.44 → 2826.32] It was great.
[2826.44 → 2831.30] I think especially since it was like the old school Linus Media Group guys who came down here.
[2831.36 → 2832.52] That was really cool to hang out with you guys.
[2832.76 → 2833.16] So yeah.
[2833.92 → 2836.56] Of course, you know, we're still super pissed that we lost and everything.
[2836.70 → 2837.44] But thank you.
[2837.54 → 2842.00] Thank you for having us on Scrappy Art Wars and for bringing us on WAN's show.
[2842.12 → 2842.66] So you guys can.
[2842.66 → 2843.80] We'll hold these dear to our hearts.
[2844.04 → 2844.62] We really will.
[2845.06 → 2846.22] We'll be in our hearts forever.
[2846.88 → 2847.48] All right.
[2847.54 → 2848.36] Thanks, guys.
[2848.50 → 2849.22] Thanks, guys.
[2849.44 → 2850.06] Bye, everybody.
[2850.46 → 2850.78] See you.
[2851.12 → 2851.66] Bye, Hero.
[2852.92 → 2853.56] Bye, Hero.
[2853.98 → 2855.40] He's down there licking his butt.
[2855.44 → 2855.88] Gross.
[2857.08 → 2859.16] That's Paul's dog for those of you who don't know.
[2859.34 → 2859.56] All right.
[2859.64 → 2859.92] I'm done.
[2860.12 → 2860.72] I'm cutting it off.
[2860.80 → 2861.16] Paul's.
[2861.28 → 2861.68] Paul's.
[2862.06 → 2862.32] Yeah.
[2863.40 → 2863.96] Save.
[2864.24 → 2864.72] Save.
[2865.26 → 2865.72] All right.
[2866.12 → 2866.50] All right.
[2867.28 → 2870.82] So back to the WAN show.
[2870.94 → 2871.56] Sponsor spots.
[2872.10 → 2875.14] We actually have a couple sponsors today.
[2875.56 → 2876.04] Are they back?
[2876.06 → 2879.64] I think Savage Jerky's back, which is great because it means we get to eat the jerky.
[2879.78 → 2880.06] I know.
[2880.28 → 2885.20] Colton will actually hit us if we eat the jerky when it is not a Savage Jerky.
[2885.50 → 2886.14] Sponsor spot.
[2886.16 → 2886.96] He will hit us savagely.
[2887.16 → 2888.02] Yeah, savagely.
[2888.78 → 2889.62] Savage Jerky.
[2889.76 → 2892.42] Their jerky is made with the best ingredients.
[2892.92 → 2893.54] The best.
[2894.96 → 2897.42] All of my friends called me, and they were like, no, it's the best.
[2897.70 → 2898.40] No, it's the best.
[2898.44 → 2898.80] You know what?
[2898.80 → 2900.16] I'm not doing it today, though.
[2900.34 → 2900.52] No?
[2900.52 → 2901.14] It's your turn.
[2901.30 → 2901.62] Oh.
[2901.92 → 2903.50] You're doing a spicy one today.
[2904.02 → 2906.30] I'm eating the cracked pepper and sea salt beef jerky.
[2906.30 → 2906.78] Which one?
[2906.78 → 2907.66] Because this one's really nice.
[2907.68 → 2908.20] You pick which one.
[2908.52 → 2909.16] I get to pick?
[2909.18 → 2909.74] You get to pick.
[2909.88 → 2910.32] Oh, well.
[2911.06 → 2911.54] You know what?
[2911.58 → 2912.58] I did it last week.
[2913.36 → 2914.80] And no, no.
[2914.86 → 2917.16] I'm not going to give you the one that I did last week.
[2917.28 → 2917.60] Okay.
[2917.60 → 2920.60] So the one I did last week was the Reaper.
[2920.60 → 2921.62] I don't even know what it was.
[2921.62 → 2921.70] The Reaper.
[2921.90 → 2922.28] I thought so.
[2922.28 → 2924.54] So this is a five alarm one.
[2924.74 → 2924.94] Yeah.
[2925.12 → 2930.38] But the reason I'm not going to give you the Reaper is because, from my experience, the
[2930.38 → 2932.90] ghost pepper buffalo sauce one is actually worse.
[2933.02 → 2933.36] Okay.
[2933.86 → 2934.30] Great.
[2934.84 → 2935.28] Awesome.
[2935.62 → 2935.90] Good to know.
[2935.90 → 2936.66] So Savage Jerky.
[2936.66 → 2941.82] The goal was to create a snack that was full of flavour and spice that wasn't bad for you.
[2941.88 → 2946.92] And the inspiration for their flavours comes from garlic, lime, and cilantro, and whatever
[2946.92 → 2950.72] else is on the front of the package since it brings out the natural flavour of premium
[2950.72 → 2951.12] beef.
[2951.72 → 2957.12] People love the sriracha bacon, maple buffalo bacon, and of course, the traditional flavours.
[2957.96 → 2960.54] We love you guys loving watching us suffer.
[2960.70 → 2964.50] So we eat the really spicy stuff, which is really not for the faint of heart.
[2964.50 → 2965.70] That's all that's left in there.
[2965.70 → 2966.80] Is that cool?
[2966.92 → 2967.54] Or should I get the other one?
[2967.54 → 2967.68] Yeah.
[2967.74 → 2968.18] Go for it.
[2968.44 → 2971.48] They also make barbecue sauce, hot sauce, and a spice rub.
[2971.56 → 2975.50] Their Carolina Reaper hot sauce uses one of the hottest peppers in the world, the Carolina
[2975.50 → 2975.78] Reaper.
[2976.26 → 2978.50] And you can use offer code LTT to save...
[2978.50 → 2978.66] Whoops.
[2978.74 → 2980.00] I don't have the lower third down.
[2980.20 → 2986.10] You can use offer code LTT to save 10% over at www.savagejerky.com.
[2988.60 → 2989.04] Hmm.
[2989.20 → 2990.34] That one's just perfect.
[2990.34 → 3000.72] Our next bot is for an ever popular FreshBooks sponsor.
[3002.40 → 3007.40] FreshBooks is the small business accounting software that you saw featured in Scrapyard
[3007.40 → 3007.68] Wars.

[3023.84 → 3028.18] and you can see when your clients have seen your invoice, putting an end to the guessing
[3028.18 → 3028.56] games.
[3028.56 → 3034.06] So whether you run a small business like a computer repair shop, or if you do some freelance
[3034.06 → 3040.24] work for some local offices doing networking for them, or let's say you do some photography
[3040.24 → 3045.40] or, you know, some freelance video editing, whatever it is, FreshBooks helps you spend your
[3045.40 → 3050.76] time doing your work instead of spending your time documenting your work and billing for
[3050.76 → 3051.30] your work.

[3058.66 → 3059.30] How are you doing over there?
[3059.48 → 3060.18] Actually fine.
[3064.20 → 3065.34] It's not even that.
[3065.40 → 3065.98] Oh, look at that.
[3066.02 → 3066.80] We do have another pack.
[3066.88 → 3067.10] Yeah.
[3067.20 → 3068.80] Like, I think there just wasn't enough.
[3068.94 → 3069.28] Okay.
[3069.38 → 3069.68] All right.
[3069.72 → 3069.96] All right.
[3069.96 → 3074.52] You know how there's like, you can actually see the like spicy stuff on this jerky?
[3074.74 → 3074.92] Yeah.
[3075.10 → 3079.84] I think maybe those two little bits, like, didn't get it too much.
[3079.84 → 3080.86] There's a full package, baby.
[3081.14 → 3081.82] Oh, jeez.
[3081.82 → 3084.08] I've always got a full package for you.
[3084.24 → 3085.16] Oh, just the smell.
[3085.30 → 3088.42] The smell is savage, as they say.
[3088.42 → 3089.06] Now I'm going to get wrecked.
[3089.38 → 3089.86] All right.
[3090.20 → 3090.70] There we go.
[3090.80 → 3093.92] Now, we actually have a new sponsor on the show for you guys today.
[3094.64 → 3095.08] Spectrum.
[3096.02 → 3097.52] Oh, I guess we don't need these anymore.
[3098.20 → 3098.38] Yeah.
[3099.94 → 3104.82] So James has actually been using these for quite a while at his station.
[3104.82 → 3110.52] So staring at a monitor all day, it's actually no secret that the blue light can be more harmful
[3110.52 → 3114.30] for your eyes than some other wavelengths than Spectrum.
[3114.64 → 3119.94] Basically aims to make their glasses an affordable long-term solution to staring at a computer screen
[3119.94 → 3120.60] all day.
[3120.60 → 3121.60] Okay.
[3121.60 → 3127.20] You can use software solutions like Flux and Twilight, but they don't give you the same
[3127.20 → 3128.82] type of filtering that glasses do.
[3129.20 → 3132.86] Features include being stylish, and I'll let you guys be the judge of that.
[3132.94 → 3133.98] I think we look great, though.
[3134.46 → 3135.06] Yours look good.
[3135.40 → 3137.32] I have no real context for...
[3137.32 → 3137.72] Yeah, yours are right there.
[3137.72 → 3140.02] But if I look at that, I only see this.
[3140.02 → 3140.34] Oh, right.
[3140.44 → 3142.86] You can't look at it straight on, because it's like...
[3142.86 → 3143.00] Yeah.
[3143.90 → 3144.88] I think you look beautiful.
[3145.04 → 3145.36] Thank you.
[3145.80 → 3146.70] High quality.
[3146.96 → 3148.08] They've got a one-year warranty.
[3148.42 → 3149.72] And low colour distortion.
[3150.00 → 3155.52] So the idea is to block high-energy blue light while keeping colours as similar as possible.
[3155.84 → 3159.96] They're the highest rated among competitors on Amazon, and they're primarily focused on the
[3159.96 → 3164.80] Canadian and U.S. markets, but they will be expanding to Europe and will offer shipping
[3164.80 → 3165.44] internationally.
[3165.44 → 3171.40] So you can check them out at spectrumglasses.com slash collections slash products, or at the
[3171.40 → 3172.70] link below the video.
[3172.82 → 3175.60] Use offer code Linus to save 10%.
[3175.60 → 3177.58] I'm still doing okay.
[3177.86 → 3178.86] I'm having some more jerky.
[3179.06 → 3179.44] Really?
[3179.66 → 3179.90] Yeah.
[3180.06 → 3181.64] You can handle the ghost pepperoni.
[3181.68 → 3182.88] I wonder if it's just...
[3182.88 → 3183.44] Tolerance?
[3183.58 → 3184.86] Because we've done this so many times?
[3185.02 → 3185.68] Yeah, maybe.
[3185.94 → 3186.62] Like, literally maybe.
[3186.94 → 3190.02] Because there was one show where I ate the ghost pepperoni, and it wrecked me.
[3190.14 → 3190.86] Or was that the Reaper?
[3191.32 → 3192.12] I thought it was this one.
[3192.12 → 3193.36] I thought it was both, to be honest.
[3194.32 → 3195.06] It's hot.
[3195.06 → 3197.16] Like, it's really hot, but it's not like...
[3197.16 → 3197.56] There's been...
[3197.56 → 3199.44] I know there's been times when I, like, can't handle it.
[3199.90 → 3200.14] Hmm.
[3200.26 → 3202.90] They should have, like, random little...
[3202.90 → 3204.22] I'm going to keep talking about savage jerky.
[3204.34 → 3204.88] I do this a lot.
[3205.64 → 3207.26] They should have, like, a challenge pack.
[3208.58 → 3208.94] Hmm.
[3209.56 → 3213.30] That's, like, a little bit of, like, all of their spiciest ones.
[3214.06 → 3214.98] That's a good idea.
[3215.12 → 3218.28] And you can, like, give your friend as, like, kind of like a joke gift or something.
[3218.48 → 3218.70] Yeah.
[3218.78 → 3220.36] Like a challenge pack of beef jerky.
[3220.44 → 3221.58] Like, see how hot they can get.
[3222.12 → 3223.06] That's actually a very cool idea.
[3223.06 → 3225.66] They'll probably watch this spot, and they will probably...
[3226.24 → 3227.28] Make a challenge pack.
[3227.48 → 3229.00] Because that would actually be fascinating.
[3229.00 → 3229.88] At least consider it.
[3230.20 → 3230.44] Yeah.
[3230.98 → 3231.40] All right.
[3231.52 → 3232.78] We've got some big news here.
[3232.84 → 3234.52] The original article is from Bloomberg.
[3234.96 → 3236.08] Call it, like, the garment.
[3236.08 → 3244.22] Facebook chases television's $70 billion stash with its own video series.
[3244.82 → 3246.08] So Facebook is apparently...
[3246.82 → 3248.20] This is crazy.
[3248.94 → 3255.58] Starting to fund the creation of video series that will begin to appear on Facebook.com.
[3255.58 → 3264.00] So they're closing deals for their first batch of shows, which will be available via a new video tab on Facebook that is not there yet.
[3264.68 → 3270.16] By funding original programs, Facebook hopes to entice more production companies to upload premium video.
[3270.50 → 3275.00] And will use them to siphon advertising dollars away from television.
[3275.00 → 3277.04] I mean, here's an idea, Facebook.
[3277.22 → 3283.72] If you guys are really serious about video, why don't you actually share some of the ad revenue with the people who are already uploading video on your platform?
[3284.16 → 3286.98] Like, we upload to Facebook, but we don't get paid for it.
[3288.24 → 3289.30] So, yeah.
[3289.42 → 3291.40] That would be maybe a thing, you guys.
[3292.06 → 3292.72] It's interesting.
[3292.84 → 3294.10] That seems to be the flavour of the month.
[3294.10 → 3299.18] Like, self-produced, proper TV shows that you host on a website.
[3301.32 → 3302.02] You know what I'm saying?
[3302.44 → 3304.42] Like, Netflix kind of blew the heck up.
[3304.60 → 3310.38] And then instead of redistributing everyone else's stuff, I started going really, really hard with making their own things.
[3310.42 → 3313.24] And actually cancelling contracts for redistributing other people's stuff.
[3313.48 → 3315.42] And more being a platform for making their own things.
[3315.92 → 3317.24] Amazon Video's doing it like crazy.
[3317.32 → 3318.38] Now Facebook is doing it.
[3318.54 → 3321.68] YouTube's trying to make their own, like, show-like content on their own premium platform.
[3321.68 → 3325.60] It actually kind of blows me away that YouTube has been so incredibly unsuccessful at it.
[3325.74 → 3326.06] Yes.
[3326.32 → 3327.32] But they're trying.
[3328.18 → 3328.50] Yeah.
[3328.64 → 3329.98] It's just, like, it's kind of remarkable.
[3330.28 → 3330.44] Yeah.
[3332.38 → 3332.78] Anyway.
[3334.64 → 3336.18] They're funding two kinds of programs.
[3336.58 → 3342.74] Hero shows will be expensive series from established TV producers that will take a few months to produce.
[3343.56 → 3347.28] And spotlight shows will be cheaper videos from publishers like Vox and BuzzFeed.
[3347.28 → 3352.52] All shows will be episodic and designed to spur conversation among Facebook users.
[3354.76 → 3355.50] What do you think?
[3356.52 → 3365.06] Facebook has paid celebrities to use its live video feature and encouraged TV networks and movie studios to stream live events and trailers on the social network for free promotion.
[3365.76 → 3369.04] But this is a whole other thing.
[3369.04 → 3373.10] I think it's kind of interesting.
[3373.46 → 3379.66] What's getting a little bit frustrating for me is now that there's all these platforms, we have the same kind of issue that we had before.
[3380.08 → 3380.94] Like on TV?
[3381.14 → 3381.48] Yeah.
[3381.76 → 3387.74] Where if the idea was that, okay, you buy your cable subscription, and you've got access to all your content.
[3388.56 → 3390.56] And then there are so many different channels.
[3390.76 → 3391.84] Now you need all the different packages.
[3392.06 → 3392.84] And it's like, oh, my goodness.
[3393.32 → 3393.96] This costs so much.
[3394.54 → 3395.38] Need that too.
[3395.38 → 3400.62] This costs so much now, which is frustrating.
[3401.24 → 3403.88] And then now everyone has their own platform.
[3404.66 → 3404.76] Yep.
[3404.94 → 3412.64] So now it's like, oh, before, if I wanted to watch TV shows, if I wanted to watch TV shows, I would just subscribe to Netflix.
[3413.24 → 3413.46] Yeah.
[3413.72 → 3417.56] And now it's not even that like, I'm not even just saying this because of Flow plane.
[3417.84 → 3421.02] But my main frustration is that it's actually all in different places.
[3421.02 → 3423.88] So here's one argument.
[3424.16 → 3427.78] And it doesn't actually help with the last thing you just said.
[3427.88 → 3431.00] But I had already kind of committed to saying this before you said that.
[3431.08 → 3431.72] So now I'm stuck.
[3431.98 → 3432.08] Yep.
[3432.08 → 3443.14] At least even after you subscribe to Netflix and Hulu and Amazon Prime Video and YouTube Red and Facebook Video.
[3443.22 → 3444.36] I don't even know if they're going to charge for it.
[3444.36 → 3444.66] HBO Go.
[3444.94 → 3447.16] HBO Go and Float plane.
[3447.16 → 3454.00] Even after you subscribe to all of those things, you're still paying less than what like Nick pays for his cable TV subscription.
[3454.12 → 3454.22] Yeah.
[3454.40 → 3455.64] So if you're a cord cutter.
[3456.26 → 3456.90] No, I hear that.
[3456.98 → 3458.26] It's not that bad.
[3458.36 → 3459.82] I still think it's better to be a cord cutter.
[3459.96 → 3461.20] It'd be nice if it all consoled.
[3461.24 → 3463.04] Like it'd be nice if Plex could just.
[3463.62 → 3464.02] Yeah.
[3464.64 → 3465.28] Like that would be.
[3465.34 → 3465.94] Bring it all together.
[3466.20 → 3466.46] That would.
[3466.74 → 3467.18] You know what?
[3467.26 → 3468.50] Plex, make that.
[3468.80 → 3468.98] Yeah.
[3468.98 → 3471.94] That's honestly my biggest complaint is that I have to go all over the place.
[3472.26 → 3477.40] And like it's a little bit frustrating because even with all these bazillion different platforms, I still can't get everything.
[3478.04 → 3478.18] Yeah.
[3478.20 → 3479.50] I want to watch Star Wars Rebels.
[3480.24 → 3481.30] I can't.
[3481.70 → 3481.98] Right.
[3482.22 → 3484.00] You can't do it in Canada legally.
[3484.30 → 3488.34] Like yeah, I know there's like multiple many different ways to pirate it.
[3488.48 → 3491.64] Which I found while trying to buy it legally.
[3491.86 → 3496.70] Because I couldn't find a way to find it legally and there was all the pirate ones right at the top because it's so difficult.
[3496.70 → 3499.76] Well, to be fair, for the people that don't know, we're in Canada.
[3500.14 → 3500.98] That's why it's a problem.
[3501.24 → 3501.36] Yeah.
[3501.46 → 3502.52] In the States, it's not a problem.
[3503.28 → 3503.60] Wow.
[3503.68 → 3504.34] Just buy the DVDs.
[3504.38 → 3506.02] I have to do it at the end of the season.
[3506.14 → 3506.90] That's what I'm doing.
[3507.10 → 3509.00] I bought the first two seasons on DVD.
[3509.44 → 3511.76] Viewers on the show have tanked since Paul and Kyle left.
[3512.50 → 3513.46] We should get them back.
[3513.56 → 3514.88] Paul, Kyle, come back.
[3515.18 → 3516.06] Please help us.
[3516.06 → 3516.40] Yeah.
[3517.56 → 3518.26] All right.
[3518.32 → 3519.78] Moving on to our next topic then.
[3519.78 → 3527.92] The iPad Pro outperforms the MacBook Pro in some CPU and GPU tasks.
[3528.30 → 3534.06] The original article here is from 9to5Mac, and it was posted by Hey Yo on the forum.
[3534.38 → 3539.12] Now, to be clear, we're talking about Geek bench, I think, in this case.
[3539.12 → 3547.52] Which is not the be-all and end-all of performance benchmarks necessarily.
[3548.12 → 3551.44] And this is very much an apples to oranges comparison.
[3552.46 → 3559.32] But they stacked the 2017 and 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar models up against four different
[3559.32 → 3563.98] iPad Pro models and put them through a series of Geek bench and GFX bench tests looking at
[3563.98 → 3565.36] CPU and GPU performance.
[3565.36 → 3569.08] Yeah, I'm usually really against, like, just blindly hating on things.
[3569.28 → 3573.00] But, uh, Oh This in the chat said, comparing crap with crap.
[3573.24 → 3573.64] Great.
[3574.10 → 3575.96] And I just, I just, ugh.
[3576.66 → 3577.10] It was good.
[3577.54 → 3578.58] I liked that one.
[3579.48 → 3579.86] It was pretty good.
[3579.86 → 3583.26] Well, the MacBook Pro is not, uh, the latest one, like.
[3583.34 → 3588.26] But I think what he's saying is, like, I, like, yeah, but it's probably by not a huge
[3588.26 → 3588.62] amount.
[3589.02 → 3592.90] And, like, I don't know if this is going to influence anyone's purchasing decision, so.
[3593.00 → 3594.92] No, because they're completely different devices.
[3594.92 → 3595.46] Yeah, so.
[3596.30 → 3601.16] It's like saying that your toaster outperforms your oven in some benchmarks.
[3601.82 → 3602.04] Yeah.
[3602.14 → 3602.74] That's nice.
[3602.80 → 3604.38] And they're both heat stuff up.
[3604.42 → 3606.38] Like, they're similar in that, in that way.
[3606.84 → 3613.12] But in much the same way that you wouldn't, um, you know, edit video in a serious way on
[3613.12 → 3615.02] an iPad Pro, you wouldn't.
[3615.02 → 3616.02] Like, you can do bits.
[3616.36 → 3617.94] You wouldn't bake a turkey in a, in a toaster.
[3618.38 → 3618.60] So.
[3619.02 → 3619.98] But you could.
[3620.92 → 3621.68] Not the whole thing.
[3621.68 → 3622.56] Not a toaster oven.
[3622.56 → 3624.08] Well, okay, okay.
[3624.20 → 3624.50] You could.
[3624.78 → 3626.86] You could make turkey in a toaster.
[3627.52 → 3628.82] If it came to that.
[3630.24 → 3631.44] Or at least a will, there's a way.
[3631.84 → 3637.74] So, the, uh, apparently the 12.9 and 10.5 inch models did edge out both MacBook Pro models.
[3637.74 → 3643.08] And for multicore CPU performance, though, the MacBook Pro came out on top.
[3643.16 → 3648.02] But in second place, the 2017 one, in second place was the 10.5-inch iPad Pro.
[3648.72 → 3650.00] So, a couple of caveats.
[3650.14 → 3653.52] The benchmark tests are not necessarily anything to do with real world.
[3653.94 → 3658.38] MacBook Pro models have larger, higher resolution displays than the iPad Pros, which play a role,
[3658.48 → 3659.56] especially in GPU tests.
[3659.62 → 3664.52] And iOS's software is nearly perfectly optimized for the devices it runs on, whereas there's
[3664.52 → 3666.22] a bit more room for error when it comes to macOS.
[3666.34 → 3671.04] Okay, I don't know if that's necessarily a valid, um, yeah, that doesn't make any sense.
[3671.10 → 3672.32] I don't know how that ended up in the notes.
[3672.38 → 3672.74] All right.
[3673.38 → 3673.74] Leaked!
[3674.36 → 3677.24] AMD's Epic 7000 series.
[3677.92 → 3680.52] We don't have Xbox One X news in the dock.
[3681.54 → 3682.32] Xbox One X.
[3682.38 → 3682.74] Oh, yeah.
[3682.78 → 3683.56] Do you want to talk about it?
[3685.14 → 3685.94] It's on the dock.
[3686.28 → 3687.28] I can go find a thing.
[3687.38 → 3688.38] I know the name is stupid.
[3689.16 → 3689.60] Yeah, cool.
[3689.80 → 3690.14] Again.
[3691.10 → 3691.40] Yeah.
[3691.40 → 3693.44] So, AMD Epic 7000.
[3693.58 → 3695.78] Apparently, it's supposed to launch on June 20th.
[3695.80 → 3696.20] Oh, wow.
[3696.32 → 3696.48] Okay.
[3696.54 → 3697.40] That's really soon.
[3697.66 → 3700.20] So, um, oh, okay.
[3700.26 → 3701.76] No, maybe this is just the NDA lifts.
[3702.10 → 3707.02] So, it's supposed to be, according to this article, up to 32 high-performance Zen cores,
[3707.68 → 3716.16] 8-channel DDR4 memory, with up to 2 terabytes of memory supported per CPU, 128 PCI Express lanes,
[3717.02 → 3719.80] um, an integrated chipset, whatever that means.
[3719.84 → 3721.50] I think they just mean an onboard memory controller.
[3721.60 → 3723.10] Maybe they've brought some more stuff on board.
[3723.68 → 3726.98] And socket compatible with next-generation Epic processors.
[3727.20 → 3729.06] So, AMD has talked about this.
[3729.12 → 3731.42] They have a plan for Zen moving forward.
[3731.50 → 3733.12] This is not a one-and-done.
[3733.12 → 3737.16] So, the idea is no compromise on one socket.
[3737.66 → 3739.72] Something, something, something, a bunch of grass.
[3740.24 → 3741.88] And, uh, oh, look at that.
[3741.92 → 3746.88] They've got, like, a whole, a whole lineup showing how they plan to compare against the
[3746.88 → 3749.02] existing V4 Eons.
[3749.70 → 3749.98] Huh.
[3750.62 → 3751.56] Very cool.
[3752.26 → 3753.02] All right.
[3753.68 → 3757.80] They're going to have up to 180-watt server chips.
[3757.80 → 3761.60] Holy actual moly.
[3762.86 → 3763.80] That's incredible.
[3764.42 → 3765.04] All right, then.
[3765.96 → 3766.40] Cool.
[3766.60 → 3767.70] So, that's all rumoured, though.
[3767.76 → 3769.78] We don't know any of that for sure.
[3770.96 → 3771.82] Another rumour.
[3771.94 → 3775.66] This was posted by NVIDIA Intel AMD Love Triangle on the forum.
[3776.30 → 3782.54] Well, that's a, uh, that, that's a username that'll never get unfunny, because that's sure
[3782.54 → 3783.14] not happening.
[3783.14 → 3787.44] Upcoming, this is originally from Guru3D.
[3787.92 → 3796.62] Upcoming GeForce GTX Volta cards, apparently, to use GDDR5X, not HBM2, like some of their
[3796.62 → 3798.16] high-end workstation cards.
[3798.26 → 3801.94] So, the GP100 actually already uses HBM2.
[3802.50 → 3806.64] And, uh, to my knowledge, the Tesla, what is it?
[3806.72 → 3810.96] The V100, or whatever it's called, the new one.
[3810.96 → 3813.60] The Volta-based Tesla card.
[3813.88 → 3814.34] Oh, yeah.
[3814.42 → 3814.56] Yeah.
[3814.68 → 3818.50] So, that one is going to use HBM2 as well.
[3818.72 → 3823.48] But, no, the rumour here is that, uh, let's have a look here.
[3824.44 → 3831.64] While HBM2 would offer, potentially, some performance improvement, it is simply too expensive for consumer
[3831.64 → 3833.52] products at this time.
[3833.52 → 3840.52] And, if the rumoured pricing of AMD's, um, uh, what, what are they calling it?
[3841.02 → 3841.42] Frontier?
[3842.02 → 3842.66] Frontier Edition?
[3842.76 → 3843.46] Frontier Edition, yeah.
[3845.54 → 3847.04] I'm pretty darn sure it's a frontier Edition.
[3847.08 → 3848.38] Yeah, Vega Frontier Edition.
[3848.62 → 3852.34] If the rumoured pricing of Frontier Edition is anything to go by, it looks like it's going
[3852.34 → 3860.94] to be around $1,200 to $1,800, then I think that, uh, that may, that may just be the case.
[3860.98 → 3863.12] And there might not be a lot we can do about that.
[3866.26 → 3866.90] Um.
[3868.42 → 3870.88] I'm going to try to make this very quickly.
[3871.42 → 3873.52] I don't understand what this means.
[3873.96 → 3874.30] Okay.
[3874.58 → 3878.96] So, I think that's pretty much, uh, I think that's pretty much it.
[3878.96 → 3879.24] What?
[3880.52 → 3881.60] In terms of all content?
[3881.60 → 3882.14] Oh, wait.
[3882.24 → 3882.66] Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[3882.70 → 3883.32] Hold on a second.
[3883.38 → 3883.88] What is this?
[3886.70 → 3888.36] This isn't real.
[3888.46 → 3889.36] What is this?
[3892.56 → 3893.00] What?
[3893.12 → 3893.84] Hold on a second.
[3894.52 → 3895.48] Insideedition.com.
[3895.54 → 3896.76] Is this, is this real?
[3897.86 → 3898.26] Who?
[3898.26 → 3905.12] A 70-year-old great-grandmother is opening up after surviving five days trapped in her car
[3905.12 → 3907.26] after crashing 40 feet down an embankment.
[3907.26 → 3909.46] Five broken ribs, a broken back.
[3910.64 → 3914.68] She told Inside edition she was in pain but considers herself lucky.
[3914.90 → 3915.20] Bob!
[3915.90 → 3916.38] What?
[3919.62 → 3923.44] It wasn't either long before her family grew worried her nephew, Bob.
[3925.32 → 3925.92] Bob?
[3926.02 → 3927.02] Bob BS mom?
[3927.02 → 3927.76] Yeah, Bob!
[3928.14 → 3928.44] Bob Stewart?
[3928.74 → 3930.08] That's freaking awesome!
[3930.40 → 3931.08] No way!
[3931.08 → 3935.60] When Bob saw the car for the first time after her rescue, he got emotional as memories came
[3935.60 → 3936.14] floating back.
[3936.22 → 3937.16] That's understandable.
[3938.36 → 3941.68] When I first heard a voice, I was just looking over the edge.
[3941.74 → 3944.42] The more I looked, the more I could see the brush was disturbed a little bit.
[3945.26 → 3946.58] Holy crap!
[3947.12 → 3948.22] Bob, you're a badass!
[3948.22 → 3953.94] Their only clue was a ping from a cell phone tower that covered several miles along Route
[3953.94 → 3956.28] 12, which is about two hours out of Seattle.
[3956.40 → 3960.44] We didn't know if we were looking for just a car or just the phone, he recalled.
[3960.54 → 3963.84] They had to search hundreds of roads, nearly impossible to access.
[3963.84 → 3966.92] Holy cow!
[3967.04 → 3967.82] Look at the car!
[3969.74 → 3970.94] Oh no, this is a different one.
[3971.06 → 3971.34] Never mind.
[3971.44 → 3973.08] That's motorist crashes into swimming pool.
[3973.44 → 3975.04] I don't think there are pictures of this.
[3975.26 → 3975.78] Wow!
[3976.06 → 3977.44] Way to go, Bob!
[3977.56 → 3981.20] So I misunderstood the headline here.
[3981.66 → 3983.80] Scrapyard Wars 4 Champion Saves a Life.
[3983.88 → 3987.36] I was like, I thought I was reading 5, and I was like, I'm sure Paul and Kyle might have
[3987.36 → 3987.92] mentioned that.
[3988.40 → 3992.16] Also, they didn't win, and so neither of us saved a life recently.
[3992.16 → 3992.46] Yeah.
[3993.32 → 3993.76] Wow!
[3994.48 → 3996.14] So yeah, Bob from BS Mods.
[3996.14 → 3996.76] That's freaking awesome, dude.
[3996.76 → 3998.16] Freaking found his...
[3998.74 → 3999.16] Wow.
[3999.46 → 4000.22] Way to go, Bob.
[4000.92 → 4001.74] You the man, man.
[4001.76 → 4001.94] That's pretty cool.
[4003.52 → 4005.34] Oh, this is great.
[4005.50 → 4008.40] So, originally posted by Linus Touch Tips on the forum.
[4008.52 → 4009.40] Wow, whatever that means.
[4009.86 → 4011.16] Original article from Guru3D.
[4012.40 → 4017.22] Racer launches a new Blade Stealth with a 13.3 inch display and a new Gunmetal colour option.
[4017.22 → 4022.24] So if there was any doubt in my mind before whether I am in Racer's good
[4022.24 → 4024.10] books right now, this pretty much seals it.
[4024.20 → 4026.16] I didn't hear about this until I read it in the news.
[4028.90 → 4029.80] Oh my goodness.
[4029.90 → 4031.20] So there you go.
[4032.64 → 4033.34] Yeah, really.
[4033.56 → 4034.00] All right.
[4034.10 → 4036.92] So I think that pretty much wraps it up for this week's WAN show.
[4037.02 → 4038.90] Thank you guys very much for tuning in.
[4038.96 → 4039.96] We will see you again next week.
[4040.04 → 4042.94] Same bat time, same bat channel.
[4042.94 → 4044.50] Xbox One X news.
[4044.72 → 4045.12] Oh, right.
[4045.20 → 4047.30] You can read all the specs on their website.
[4047.44 → 4052.36] Ars Technica has a perfect breakdown of specs of like all the current edition consoles,
[4052.72 → 4054.16] which is absolutely pretty cool.
[4054.24 → 4055.06] So check that out.
[4055.40 → 4059.02] I will post that in the chat just in case you're looking for it.
[4059.22 → 4060.52] The name is really dumb.
[4061.12 → 4069.02] The again, just like always, the name that they had before, Xbox Scorpio, was pretty freaking
[4069.02 → 4074.90] cool, and they just canned that, went with Xbox One X, I guess, so that the acronym still
[4074.90 → 4075.48] is Xbox.
[4079.02 → 4081.52] So that's weird, but okay.
[4082.96 → 4083.64] Everything's okay.
[4083.72 → 4084.32] That's about it.
[4084.54 → 4087.22] True 4K, but like what games are going to support it?
[4087.22 → 4088.88] Pretty sure Ar's answers that too.
[4089.20 → 4090.14] Go check that out.
[4091.10 → 4092.56] True 4K on that GPU?
[4093.12 → 4094.18] Apparently it's true 4K.
[4096.80 → 4097.32] Whatever.
[4097.80 → 4098.64] See you next time.
[4099.02 → 4103.10] Yes, Joshi, I'll be streaming to me.
[4107.48 → 4107.80] Hmm.
[4108.68 → 4111.34] This guy says, Luke, indie game dev here.
[4111.44 → 4115.96] Would you be interested in a short two-player game on one keyboard based on the Sancho intro?
[4116.96 → 4118.94] And you'd have to drag the sofa in together.
[4119.74 → 4121.22] Is that a game?
[4121.22 → 4123.26] You could play it instead of running the intro.
[4124.78 → 4125.62] I think we're good.
[4126.58 → 4128.30] I mean, I can't speak for you.
[4128.30 → 4129.52] It was addressed to you.
[4129.64 → 4130.78] No, I think that's okay.
[4131.04 → 4134.32] Does that just mean I have to carry the whole couch, and you just don't really play?
[4134.50 → 4134.98] I don't know.
[4135.00 → 4136.16] You play for like the first half.
[4136.16 → 4137.02] Yeah, and then I stop.
[4137.08 → 4139.18] And then you're just like, uh, great game.
[4139.28 → 4139.66] Then I tease.
[4139.66 → 4140.52] 10 out of 10 IGN.
[4140.52 → 4141.16] So I jump right.
[4141.16 → 4153.02] Then I look like the second half.
[4153.02 → 4154.36] θη a little scooter
[4154.36 → 4155.18] also, cause,
[4155.18 → 4155.90] I don't hippie
[4155.90 → 4156.18] okay.
[4156.18 → 4156.76] So there's an all-traitor one.
[4156.76 → 4157.06] Okay.
[4157.06 → 4157.96] There it is.
[4158.24 → 4158.52] Water went right on there.
[4158.52 → 4158.88] 24th.
[4158.88 → 4159.06] So I say it's going to be over.
[4159.06 → 4159.66] There it is.
[4159.66 → 4160.82] Before I pick the Gracie on my hand.
[4160.82 → 4161.24] So I see.
[4161.24 → 4161.96] It's going to be over.
[4161.96 → 4162.56] There, there it is.
[4162.56 → 4163.10] There it is.
[4163.38 → 4164.92] There it is.
[4164.92 → 4165.42] There.
[4165.42 → 4166.40] There it is.
