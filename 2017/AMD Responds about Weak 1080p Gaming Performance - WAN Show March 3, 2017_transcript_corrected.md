[0.00 → 8.76] ah yeah we're back welcome to the wan show guys we are going to have a great show for you guys this
[8.76 → 17.36] week actually this week was like drama central very much so yeah like oh man everybody yeah
[17.36 → 22.96] there's like okay, okay so top topics this is amazing California high school makes 24 million
[22.96 → 33.04] dollars off the Snapchat IPO like what ridiculous like how is that even
[33.04 → 39.34] apparently they invested I guess no we're not talking about this right now moving on um yeah
[39.34 → 47.56] so Uber plans to turn its app into a content marketplace during rides totally needed that
[47.56 → 55.42] and any other opinion is just invalid AMD responds to weak 1080p gaming results on dozen and intel
[55.42 → 61.72] responds to strong gaming results at other resolutions on dozen by slashing the pricing
[61.72 → 69.54] of their core i7 and core i5 processors by a lot it just got real kids yeah let's roll the intro
[69.54 → 84.20] hopefully this is reflected in used product service you know someone complained about the fact that we
[84.20 → 91.38] talked over the music in the intro and said it was like really unprofessional I always liked that
[91.38 → 97.84] in the intro who cares in any show where they like talked over it I was like hey cool not even that i
[97.84 → 104.88] don't even think it's cool I just think it's completely irrelevant right who cares yeah yeah we're
[104.88 → 111.94] talking we're we're here I mean they're like yeah they forget to turn off that we didn't forget to turn
[111.94 → 121.20] it off and do it we specifically turned it on no i I turn it on like okay before we had an USB audio
[121.20 → 127.86] interface I would specifically have the HDMI in because we were using camera audio in yeah and i
[127.86 → 134.90] would specifically have that HDMI source sitting under the intro so that if we're chatting behind it
[134.90 → 142.20] you guys can definitely hear it yeah I mean actually live that's right coming at you live not pre-recorded
[142.20 → 147.02] yeah or is it oh damn dun dun dun would it really matter
[147.02 → 156.50] okay so let's get into this one first the original article here is from cbc.ca
[156.50 → 163.26] I got it oh I'm sorry we both got it you know what everybody's got it look at this everybody's got it
[163.26 → 169.42] no we both got it look at that look at how we can both share our screens now a California high school
[169.42 → 177.76] makes 24 million dollars in the Snapchat IPO now so hold on can i jump in with a question
[177.76 → 186.04] first yeah 100 why are schools allowed to invest money I can answer that okay good a private school
[186.04 → 193.70] I see this is a private catholic high school in California Silicon Valley they agreed to invest
[193.70 → 198.18] fifteen thousand dollars in seed money into Snapchat in 2012 that happened because one of the student's
[198.18 → 206.04] parents is a VC venture capitalist so it was like able to push this through they bought that fifteen
[206.04 → 210.64] thousand dollars worth of shares which totals six hundred thousand shares
[210.64 → 222.46] they sold one point four oh, oh no they okay they had two million shares they sold one point four
[222.46 → 229.14] million shares at seventeen dollars during Snapchat's IPO this week generating about 24 million dollars but
[229.14 → 234.62] they still have six hundred thousand shares which is still worth like seventeen million dollars
[234.62 → 244.32] holy crap investment man yeah investment wow how is it that technology companies don't do much
[244.32 → 250.52] but gamble make millions of dollars I mean how are these companies worth this kind of money
[250.52 → 257.36] Snapchat so okay this was the biggest social media IPO since twitter more than three years ago
[257.36 → 268.30] shares closed at 24 48 apiece so 24 48 apiece which means Snapchat is now valued at 28 billion dollars now
[268.30 → 281.14] just to 28 billion dollars it's an astronomical their net loss is still higher than their revenue
[281.14 → 291.28] how do we assign value to these companies it just keeps happening investors don't have a clear picture
[291.28 → 297.50] of how the company plans to become profitable I mean to me how do you even figure that out
[297.50 → 304.54] like we are this far in the hole to be like a 75 percent gain over loss company
[304.54 → 314.04] at 28 billion dollars what do we need to do where are we going to pull 28 billion dollars out of our
[314.04 → 320.36] rectums oh man and I bet you someone could Snapchat you and show you how oh I wouldn't want to see that
[320.36 → 325.40] Snapchat I mean I'm like I'm down but no I'm not down
[325.40 → 329.40] and he's gone
[329.40 → 334.76] you know I had to go after you when you're going to take a big drink of water like that
[334.76 → 340.34] oh my god I almost lost it okay I mean all i had to do to make you spit it all over the screen
[340.34 → 343.94] was said send that snap Luke take a deep breath
[343.94 → 356.74] terrible um, so user growth slowed in the fourth quarter um and there's skepticism
[356.74 → 363.96] as to how big the company's advertising business i mean the whole model of like
[363.96 → 369.48] a lot of users look at our junk okay that came across wrong um a lot I mean
[369.48 → 375.22] a lot okay it's Snapchat so okay, okay, so a lot of users look at our junk online
[375.22 → 379.00] yeah um therefore you should put ads on our junk
[379.00 → 382.76] and users would see those ads this is working really well
[382.76 → 388.64] and users will see those ads, and they will maybe buy your product or sing up for your service I mean
[388.64 → 396.24] we're going to get to the point where the valuation and expected revenue of the companies who is a entire
[396.24 → 404.42] whose entire business model is like other companies selling stuff through them the value of these
[404.42 → 411.80] companies is going to be bigger than the ones who are actually producing products or making services
[411.80 → 416.18] you're making fun of our own company right I'm not making fun look
[416.18 → 425.56] okay yes we but we're okay we don't expect that our market cap is higher than intel's though
[425.56 → 431.78] that's the difference yeah that's fair yeah yeah we are not evaluated at 28 billion and here's the
[431.78 → 437.38] thing too I think if we're looking at a company like Snapchat going like yes there's huge advertising
[437.38 → 443.68] potential here like that advertising money has to come from somewhere and I think there's still a lot
[443.68 → 455.34] of room for traditional media to bleed um I mean TV advertising really doesn't make a ton of sense to me
[455.34 → 466.14] I mean you can look at big shows like big shows like adventure time, or you know the Big Bang Theory
[466.14 → 471.58] Game of Thrones Game of Thrones well Game of Thrones is a bad example it's HBO yeah so I'm talking ad
[471.58 → 479.70] supported shows okay you look at these big shows and you kind of go okay so they had like
[479.70 → 485.46] okay what are south parks ratings over the last year South Park ratings you know maybe they had
[485.46 → 492.12] five million or ten million people who tuned into the premiere let's have let's have a look
[492.12 → 496.58] South Park uh no, no where's the uh where's the episodes come on come on come on come on
[496.58 → 504.58] episodes here we go list of episodes there we go okay so show like South Park recent season wow you
[504.58 → 511.70] got to scroll through a lot of seasons for this particular show okay here we go we got uh an estimated
[511.70 → 523.36] 1.3 to 2 million and change U.S. viewers of a season premiere and I look at the prices
[523.36 → 529.90] that that is not really what I thought it would be for well it's fallen a lot you look at the prices
[529.90 → 537.40] that you pay for cable advertising, and we look at sort of the rates that we're allowed to charge
[537.40 → 541.44] that we can get sponsors to pay for inclusion in our videos and I'm sitting here going
[541.44 → 548.98] like our video could actually get more viewership on the ad especially given that
[548.98 → 556.98] like no not really given anything uh I mean I'm I'm I'm saying given that it's shorter so given
[556.98 → 561.30] that people don't won't really tune in and out of it in the same way, but people do skip around in
[561.30 → 565.06] YouTube videos so I took it back before I said it but then I said it but then I explained why I took
[565.06 → 569.52] it back before I said it absolutely fair and I explained the whole thing yeah so but my point is
[569.52 → 578.82] that there's still room for companies to clue in that just that that standard quarterly spend
[578.82 → 584.94] you'd be surprised i no, no I'm what I mean is that there's still there is no I'm agreeing with
[584.94 → 591.12] them to them, you'd be surprised there's still a lot of room for them to clue in that a viewer on YouTube
[591.12 → 597.52] is also a viewer the same way as a viewer on Comedy Central or NBC or whatever the case may be
[597.52 → 605.80] um but with that said I do think that it is hard for someone like Snapchat I think that Facebook
[605.80 → 612.54] has actually set kind of an unrealistic bar for other online advertising platforms both Facebook
[612.54 → 618.98] and google um where everyone looked at the Facebook IPO with a lot of skepticism figured they were
[618.98 → 625.38] overvalued huh they've gone up in value because they've been really smart about it and Facebook because
[625.38 → 633.44] it knows so much about you advertises to you so well Snapchat I'm not convinced that the way people
[633.44 → 643.00] use Snapchat and the demographic that uses Snapchat is going to be as easily influenced by an online ad
[643.00 → 650.76] as the demographic that uses Facebook and the user habits of a typical Facebook user would you agree with
[650.76 → 656.68] that yes I mean if i it's like it's like putting advertising in WhatsApp even Facebook hasn't
[656.68 → 662.34] bothered to try to do that because I'm here to communicate with people you put an ad in it, I will
[662.34 → 667.70] go use a different messaging app and there will like always be another one and there will all there
[667.70 → 672.98] there will always be another one because there will it's like a gold rush right yeah, so there will
[672.98 → 680.56] always be a bunch of teams of developers with these incredible resumes of all the umpteen billion
[680.56 → 685.82] dollar companies that they came from cashed out and decided to start their own to turn their umpteen
[685.82 → 692.12] billions into umpteen billions cubed or whatever whatever whatever target it is however many more
[692.12 → 697.06] teslas they need or primuses I mean it's San Fran so that's basically the only two options
[697.06 → 704.14] um one interesting tidbit yes before we continue yes um a lot of people in the chat thought
[704.14 → 711.86] we missed the outro and uh the word I think the word restart has been like banned now thank you ghost
[711.86 → 715.82] because everyone was just spamming or the intro sorry they're just spamming the crap out of it
[715.82 → 723.08] I think it's just because we were mostly on time so people like didn't see it oh yeah we started
[723.08 → 730.20] like 15 minutes ago, so there's that so we definitely did the intro yeah the intro has
[730.20 → 735.14] definitely been completed there is no restarting that's going to happen and I believe there was audio
[735.14 → 740.18] too and if you start spamming restart and chat like a bunch you just did it's just gonna bang
[740.18 → 748.64] um because the LTT chatbot is merciless okay so here's my final point on the Snapchat IPO
[748.64 → 755.42] I think that Facebook set unrealistic expectations for a social media platform going public
[755.42 → 762.66] and then when everyone was skeptical they went ahead, and they exceeded even the most bullish
[762.66 → 769.82] expectations and so now I think it has set the stage for these other companies to be valued
[769.82 → 775.32] and in a different way like people are invested in Facebook for the long term now
[775.32 → 781.28] instead of just like you know jumping on the bandwagon making a quick buck and getting to
[781.28 → 788.00] I don't know that Snapchat will enjoy that kind of long-term success because
[788.00 → 795.28] if they ever want to actually be profitable they do have to figure out how to compete with someone
[795.28 → 801.10] like Facebook and google and I'm I'm really not that convinced yeah like ever uh speaking of things
[801.10 → 806.20] that I'm not convinced about let's pull up this article from tech crunch that um
[806.20 → 813.32] really doesn't make a ton of sense to me but maybe uh did you post it in chat already nope that's fine
[813.32 → 818.00] uh well no it's fine I can well you can do it someone can do it someone will do it here we can watch Luke
[818.00 → 818.50] do it now
[818.50 → 823.36] we're watching you do it on the internet
[823.36 → 831.76] and my girlfriend would be pretty pissed off and terrible I love how you're like
[831.76 → 838.26] my girlfriend would be pissed off you just have no problem with it right do I interpret this correctly
[838.26 → 844.08] you're my boss man wait so that makes it better or worse just doing my job
[844.08 → 854.18] we have all kinds of jobs around here dirty jobs done dirt cheap even um okay hey so Uber plans to
[854.18 → 863.16] turn its app into a content marketplace and then they actually kind of had my attention
[863.16 → 873.00] until the last part of the headline where it goes during rides, so a series of third-party apps would
[873.00 → 878.00] provide you with information about the area you are going to work and productivity integrations
[878.00 → 884.00] communications with the place you are going to specifically or just standard entertainment
[884.00 → 887.70] because people can't multitask and go to google
[887.70 → 893.00] I guess, and they want to charge you for that I think
[893.00 → 904.00] the marketplace will be based on a new version of trip experiences a smaller feature first launched
[904.00 → 914.88] a year ago with a select group of partners okays so i see some I see some potential here so if it's
[914.88 → 923.84] free if the idea is that the the get in your Uber or like okay so I don't it's free sure yeah I don't
[923.84 → 929.88] look at the Uber app again after I call the Uber I sometimes do you do okay make sure the driver's
[929.88 → 935.30] staying on course or okay, okay I've gotten screwed before and Uber is perfect about like if you can
[935.30 → 940.50] prove that you got screwed on your driving path they'll give you money back cool okay so if the idea
[940.50 → 948.34] is here's a cool restaurant, and they expect the restaurant to give them a cut of whatever it is
[948.34 → 952.68] or here's a tourist destination or here's a tour that you can take or whatever the case may be
[952.68 → 959.78] then i kind of get it if they're going to try and like sell me a movie to watch then I think that's
[959.78 → 964.46] going to be uh that's going to be less less successful um
[964.46 → 970.88] yeah okay i I guess that's pretty much all I have to say about that
[970.88 → 977.02] some of this stuff sounds really stupid like they're pushing contextual engagement
[977.02 → 982.30] that might for example enable a Snapchat user to unlock special stickers or filters
[982.30 → 990.98] okay this next one's kind of cool though it could showcase Instagram pictures of the destination you're
[990.98 → 996.68] headed to yeah, but you could search on Instagram you could but having it all in one place is like
[996.68 → 1003.96] an automatic people don't like to actually do things like the airport like okay Uber you're not
[1003.96 → 1010.40] travelling across the country yeah that's true I mean maybe part of this is that the way that people
[1010.40 → 1017.34] like you and me use Uber might be a little different from the way that some people use Uber because
[1017.34 → 1023.32] my understanding and guys correct me if I'm wrong how they use yeah I'm looking at twitch
[1023.32 → 1027.52] chat because I don't know how I would come up with all these options i so I'm looking at twitch chat for
[1027.52 → 1034.84] a change but the way that I use Uber as someone who owns a car is I use it when I'm travelling and I use
[1034.84 → 1039.78] it to get from a hotel if you don't own a car, and you're using it to commute or something like that
[1039.78 → 1047.00] then you're less interested in your destination right we are like the most interested in our
[1047.00 → 1052.48] destination use case that there is and even then like you would have looked at pictures of it
[1052.48 → 1059.82] before you hold on the answers are rolling in I use her I use Uber for sex Lyft is better um
[1059.82 → 1069.20] don't use Uber just do not use it please uh all of us are poor we use shoe bar Huber I think that's a
[1069.20 → 1075.22] joke I use Uber to buy narcotics I use Uber when I'm drunk yeah there's a lot of I use Uber
[1075.22 → 1086.12] when I'm drunk um so what they're trying to do is have in-app purchases so people that are intoxicated
[1086.12 → 1091.00] okay spend more money you know what Uber's on the right path here um they know they totally know
[1091.00 → 1095.20] what's going on i clearly I have a much clearer understanding of what they're what they're trying
[1095.20 → 1101.34] to do what more social media companies need to do in order to make money Snapchat pro tip if your
[1101.34 → 1109.42] user is drunk allow them to buy things Facebook I mean Facebook has some wicked crazy facial
[1109.42 → 1117.24] recognition Facebook if you guys don't already get working on drunk recognition because as soon as
[1117.24 → 1124.10] your user uploads a selfie where they're just wasted AF sell them something you can pay like
[1124.10 → 1131.16] a lot of money to send a priority message to someone that you used to be in a relationship status with
[1131.16 → 1141.50] wow you just blew my mind it sends a Facebook message and a text message, and it starts a call
[1141.50 → 1149.58] all at the same time yeah oh wow I love it gets back together it should cost six dollars and nine
[1149.58 → 1157.10] cents wait six dollars and ninety cents yeah yeah yeah oh I love it okay um
[1157.10 → 1163.44] the twitch chat wow actually that's a pretty good idea
[1163.44 → 1171.64] hey that happens on the Wang show once in a while okay 10 remember yeah that's right
[1171.64 → 1181.32] okay AMD response this was originally posted by 3d ash on the forum the original article here is from
[1181.32 → 1192.00] pc per yeah and AMD responds to 1080 gate 1080p gaming tests on dozen Ryan shrouds my bud so I'm just
[1192.00 → 1196.82] going to read his article to you guys word for word we linked to it, and hopefully he won't get too mad at
[1196.82 → 1202.80] me because it's this it's basically plagiarism if I read his article is it not, but you're quoting it
[1202.80 → 1207.54] but I'm not giving him ad impressions by actually sending people to his site okay so tell you what
[1207.54 → 1213.28] everybody but I've had people who host sites that we've given shout-outs like contact me directly
[1213.28 → 1219.46] and be like hey thanks really because its trout would never thank me for anything no, no I hate that guy
[1219.46 → 1229.42] anyway so pc perk great site go visit it whatever Luke posted in the chat anyway the point is
[1229.42 → 1235.36] um by far one of the most interesting and concerning points about today's launch of the AMD Ryzen
[1235.36 → 1241.42] processor is gaming results many other reviewers have seen similar results to what shroud published
[1241.42 → 1247.30] in his article gaming at 1080p even at ultra image quality settings in many tops games shows a deficit in
[1247.30 → 1252.28] performance compared to kb lake and Bradwell e-processors so shroud says he shared his testing
[1252.28 → 1256.70] with AMD over a week ago must have been nice for him to actually have processors a week before his
[1256.70 → 1261.54] article was supposed to go up what a jackass I hate that guy um and to be clear our testing was done
[1261.54 → 1267.46] etc etc etc so you know there you go there's I think part of that problem is us being Canadian
[1267.46 → 1274.22] it's part of it talking to uh yeah it's part of if it's not all of it okay so yeah we there are a
[1274.22 → 1282.68] okay, okay, so this will be an aside, so agency goes yeah yeah it's shipped there's like been a don't
[1282.68 → 1287.24] have a tracking number though which by the way is nonsense unless you're shipping something by donkey
[1287.24 → 1293.04] like even if you ship by USPS to Canada United States Postal Service which is about as slow as it
[1293.04 → 1301.96] gets I mean you can't ship by boat from U.S. to Canada okay it's one land mass yeah so yeah there
[1301.96 → 1307.36] there literally isn't a way to ship that doesn't have a tracking number other than putting a stamp
[1307.36 → 1313.50] on it okay, okay there is, but it's the point is they didn't um so they're like yeah there's no
[1313.50 → 1319.06] tracking number but it shipped on Wednesday they hold they keep that story we get in touch
[1319.06 → 1323.12] with AMD directly they give us a tracking number because of course there's a tracking number
[1323.12 → 1330.66] it didn't leave till Friday so that is why we didn't get our 1800x in time also we're still trying
[1330.66 → 1337.36] to find out where our 1700 and 1700x are agency claims oh no there's no tracking number for those
[1337.36 → 1343.32] shipments, but they've been shipped, but there were storms meanwhile it's a little rainy outside
[1343.32 → 1350.08] but that's pretty normal in the pacific northwest so that's a thing we're pretty used to moving things
[1350.08 → 1357.14] in the rain anyway no problem AMD's response to the underwhelming 1080p performance is that
[1357.14 → 1363.50] they are supporting 300 plus developer kits with game development studios to optimize current and
[1363.50 → 1368.94] future game releases for the all new dozen CPU, and they do have a point here it is sort of new and
[1368.94 → 1375.56] different they announced a strategic relationship with Bethesda and CPU benchmarking deficits to the
[1375.56 → 1379.38] competition in certain games at 1080p resolution can be attributed to the development and optimization of
[1379.38 → 1386.32] games uniquely to intel platforms and again in the defence of game developers who did all of their
[1387.14 → 1393.02] platforms AMD didn't have a CPU worth a rat's pa toot in the last five years and most gamers were
[1393.02 → 1401.16] gaming on intel so I totally get why that happened um what if you could attribute a cost to a rat's
[1401.16 → 1408.48] pa toot it was like a lab rat yeah I mean they have a have a cost um and like if you're testing
[1408.48 → 1416.04] that like does it have a value all I know is that I wouldn't pay much for like a wheelbarrow full of
[1416.04 → 1423.16] them like one might have a cost but I don't think anyone wants like a truckload so it doesn't scale
[1423.16 → 1432.18] very well that's fair where am I going to put these like if a rat's pa toot is worth 25 cents like
[1432.18 → 1437.98] what so you can take like you want to store them oh yeah a few thousand of them and buy like breath
[1437.98 → 1444.92] of the wild Nintendo's going to be like to get this out of here it's like yes, yes we have like a collecting
[1444.92 → 1449.82] random bull crap that you found on the ground system it's an open world game like we didn't
[1449.82 → 1454.52] realize anyone was actually out there doing this stuff's not actually worth anything
[1454.52 → 1461.66] it's supposed to just be a video game it's like no we do not want boar hides I think that game is
[1461.66 → 1467.22] going to like single-handedly sell the switch although I don't know it works for Wii U um it's like the
[1467.22 → 1471.92] one of the fourth or fifth, or it's in the top 10 of highest rated games all time on metacritic right
[1471.92 → 1479.16] now pretty ridiculous um so basically you know what I don't have a ton to say about this other than that
[1479.16 → 1486.40] um you know AMD's got a point uh with that said I think that some of the complaints are
[1486.40 → 1494.40] a little bit if you're buying a like top tier GPU and a top tier CPU and then playing at 1080p
[1494.40 → 1502.20] it's a little weird, so there are situations where I get it if you bought an Asus pg220
[1502.20 → 1507.96] whatever it was the 240 hertz okay so if you bought a 240 hertz 1080p gaming display
[1507.96 → 1515.80] then dozen is not going to deliver the best possible experience but were you expecting it
[1515.80 → 1522.66] to I mean we already knew that dozen why I think most people were oh well they were wrong
[1522.66 → 1527.12] and dumb um because we already knew I'm just saying like I think genuinely most people were
[1527.12 → 1536.02] okay well most people some people I already knew I already knew that even the most optimistic
[1536.02 → 1545.52] estimates of dozen's performance had it at similar IPC to Bradwell and I already knew based on the most
[1545.52 → 1552.88] optimistic estimates of dozen's final clock speed that it wasn't going to be clocked higher than a 7700k
[1552.88 → 1560.56] so I already knew that it wasn't going to perform as well in single threaded applications what if you
[1560.56 → 1568.80] want to have uh only a processor and stream data 2 only a processor I've still been really confused
[1568.80 → 1575.60] by that okay so I get it a bit more now um so Anthony did some testing as part of our dozen launch
[1575.60 → 1581.42] coverage where he did take a look so you know depending on who you talk to at intel you'll find
[1581.42 → 1589.22] people who talk about how great quick sync video encoding is and it and VNC are very good the
[1589.22 → 1597.88] problem is that where they don't shine is in the low bitrate encoding scenario that is needed for
[1597.88 → 1606.46] streaming to twitch that's the problem so in order to get the best out of your 3500 kilobits per second
[1606.46 → 1611.36] which is really all that twitch will process anyway you can set it higher if you want but
[1611.36 → 1616.88] basically you're just wasting CPU cycles and due to actually you can hurt it because due to
[1616.88 → 1622.84] fluctuations if you start sending above four so if you set to like 3.8, and then it fluctuates to above
[1622.84 → 1631.42] four you'll just miss stuff, and it's bad so but at that kind of bit rate for 1080 60p
[1631.42 → 1638.84] which is like kind of lot of pixels per second um you have to have the best possible source image
[1638.84 → 1643.80] you don't even really want to do 1080 60p just an additional note if you want to do sick oh yeah
[1643.80 → 1651.70] it's like 900 fps 720 is usually okay so anyway the point still stands you're very bitrate constrained
[1651.70 → 1658.46] and the more blockiness and scrappiness in your original image the more it's going to be compounded
[1658.46 → 1666.52] by trying to stream it at a low bit rate out to your viewers he meant 1080 60 fps it's fine 1080 60p is a
[1666.52 → 1671.08] perfectly valid way to say that by the way he's just there's just a bunch of people in the yeah
[1671.08 → 1677.54] there's a bunch of people who don't know anyway so if you wanted to stream at 1080 60p
[1677.54 → 1684.58] than basically what that would mean is that you would be you would be making a slightly
[1684.58 → 1691.30] worse image even much more slightly worse um so that's why AMD is defending their use
[1691.30 → 1699.36] of x264 encoding even on systems that obviously have powerful dedicated GPUs like a like a rx480
[1699.36 → 1706.76] that is the correct way to do it yes yeah now with that said in our testing we didn't observe the same
[1706.76 → 1715.86] like 20 dropped frames that AMD had in their demos but I don't really understand that because i personally
[1715.86 → 1722.44] checked the AMD demos I opened up i I minimized the game I opened up obs I made sure they were at
[1722.44 → 1728.12] the same setting so I think it's one thing that was noticed at the event yeah was that the x99 boards
[1728.12 → 1733.08] were in dual channel memory they only had two six of ram no they weren't okay I checked I heard this i
[1733.08 → 1740.84] don't know in fact there um in fact intel specifically or intel AMD specifically even put 32 gigs of ram
[1740.84 → 1748.40] in the intel systems so that they were using um four eight gig sticks, and then they had two eight
[1748.40 → 1754.60] gig sticks in their own systems so they actually had less overall memory interesting you know okay
[1754.60 → 1760.80] hold on a second though I didn't double-check that the four sticks were in the right slots now that i
[1760.80 → 1765.68] think about it but I heard specifically two sticks so they must have just mixed up the systems or something
[1765.68 → 1770.64] I think that's quite possible because I did look at the cine bench system myself and there was at
[1770.64 → 1777.40] least one other one that like just you know I'm yeah of course yeah um, and they definitely had four
[1777.40 → 1781.94] sticks in them and they and they are right on the spec sheet they had more ram in them so yeah
[1781.94 → 1789.98] um there's another really cool thing that came out of the AMA on the AMD Subreddit though this is
[1789.98 → 1797.60] really cool um blah blah blah why is there a huge discrepancy in gaming benchmarks okay blah blah etc
[1797.60 → 1803.48] oh yes this is really cool so I actually asked this at the event but I didn't get an answer
[1803.48 → 1812.44] and um dr sue did answer it in the AMA does do dozen CPUs support ECC memory and the answer is yes
[1812.44 → 1821.80] that's cool so they're low power, and they support ECC memory for so long
[1821.80 → 1829.42] intel has held ECC kind of dangled it in front of us and gone oh you want this you want this you want
[1829.42 → 1838.82] this buy a Leon baby um I am so happy to see consumer grade CPUs with ECC memory support
[1838.82 → 1845.68] I don't know that I would run out and build a free NAS machine with you know a dozen 3 immediately after
[1845.68 → 1851.68] launch I think I want to give this platform some more time to prove itself yeah, but this is going to be
[1851.68 → 1860.50] an absolute godsend to people who want to use ZFS on the cheap in their home NAS because ZFS really
[1860.50 → 1870.70] does want ECC memory for the best operation and to reduce risk of data corruption and right now that
[1870.70 → 1874.72] means you've got to go out and buy a Leon and unfortunately there's really not much in the way
[1874.72 → 1881.06] of cheap Leon because either you're buying a full-on motherboard an intel Leon lineup really doesn't get
[1881.06 → 1887.34] and like it's there's not like a know a Cameron Leon equivalent, or you're buying like an embedded
[1887.34 → 1892.40] system that has a Leon soldered on the board and those because they're Leon are just not that cheap
[1892.40 → 1900.16] so this could be really cool cheapo it board with a HBA on it and a dozen CPU and some ECC memory
[1900.16 → 1905.94] that could be a fantastic solution so I'm pretty stoked on that
[1905.94 → 1917.80] um oh yeah sponsors speaking of things that I'm stoked on Dollar Shave Club Dollar Shave Club let's
[1917.80 → 1923.22] you don't look like no, no actually you're not scruffy today yeah good job yeah okay well you
[1923.22 → 1928.40] managed to pull that off once now literally once and now that's the new expectation oh shit now you
[1928.40 → 1937.34] have to do it I mean Dollar Shave Club but then a sponsor spot too they're going to watch this
[1937.34 → 1942.64] starting over it's its new okay, okay hold on yeah yeah we'll do a different timestamp okay do you like
[1942.64 → 1947.62] the show subscribe below and now a word from our sponsors' Dollar Shave Club oh look I'm clean shaving
[1947.62 → 1956.02] today it's wonderful it's the first time it's ever happened Dollar Shave Club is all about saving you
[1956.02 → 1961.72] time and saving you money because what could be better than saving both time and money at the
[1961.72 → 1967.96] same time while you save money wow they make high quality razors, and they ship them straight to your
[1967.96 → 1975.00] door for just a few bucks a month so you don't have to think about like oh is it really worth going and
[1975.00 → 1980.82] fighting with the guy to unlock the stupid thing and then feeling like I'm inadequate because I don't
[1980.82 → 1985.38] have the like you know ridiculous accessories that are all around this stuff no, no no Dollar Shave Club
[1985.38 → 1991.26] sends you exactly what you need and only what you need, they've got everything up to their executive
[1991.26 → 1996.70] razor they've got their aftershave they've got their dr carver shave butter which goes on clear so you can
[1996.70 → 2001.92] actually see what you're doing which is Buenos and even their one wipe Charlie's peppermint scented butt
[2001.92 → 2009.24] wipes for men there's no commitment no hidden fees, and it's available in Canada Australia and the U.S. so
[2009.24 → 2017.80] head over to dollarshaveclub.com slash Linus and join the club they have like actually their
[2017.80 → 2023.78] their model is incredible like there's I've seen interviews with their CEO where they like talk about
[2023.78 → 2031.48] how many customers they have and I was like wow, but people love it yeah what can I say it's cool it's
[2031.48 → 2036.50] easy you don't have to think about it speaking of things that are cool and easy Epiphany we love
[2036.50 → 2043.30] Epiphany's video grabbers NASA yeah so does NASA apparently they're so these guys are based in
[2043.30 → 2049.80] Canada they've got uh can i steal yours for a minute so I can hold it up that sounds risky no, no
[2049.80 → 2054.50] it should be fine actually here you know what oh wow we're going to do we're going to put we're going to put
[2054.50 → 2059.74] Epiphany on the spot oh dang okay so uh you've just got the dock open oh look at that you've got all
[2059.74 → 2066.10] the Epiphany talking points up so go ahead oh wow Epiphany uh av.io video grabbers are quoted as
[2066.10 → 2070.20] the simplest way to share video and honestly in the experience that we've had with them that sounds
[2070.20 → 2074.28] fairly legitimate my screen just went black because of that, but that makes sense that's not Epiphany's
[2074.28 → 2079.56] fault that's just like I unplugged it thing works so here it is it's a tiny little thing like this
[2079.56 → 2087.06] HDMI in USB 3 in this is their avid 4k they've got a bunch of different models um I like the uh do not
[2087.06 → 2091.94] remove sticker yeah i I removed it from the bench den this is the bench den one
[2091.94 → 2097.46] I took it but I took it for you yeah I know I appreciate it yeah I took it for you yeah um and
[2097.46 → 2103.42] basically they are as plug and play as a video capture device could possibly be yeah no driver
[2103.42 → 2109.76] install you just go bloop you plug in HDMI you open up whatever capture software it is that you want
[2109.76 → 2115.74] to use, and it automatically detects the resolution frame rate anything else you could want and check this
[2115.74 → 2121.08] out live demo oh dang live demos oh man this is exciting they're scary man they're good for
[2121.08 → 2125.86] sharing video in general you can do any computer with an USB port is pretty much how they quote that
[2125.86 → 2130.20] live event production gaming there it is boom boom I can even highlight what I'm talking about
[2130.20 → 2134.96] boom baby lecture capture if you want to be like a super baller teacher yeah that's right
[2134.96 → 2139.68] no it's awesome we love them check them out over at uh oh I'm not on the right thing check them
[2139.68 → 2145.68] out over at epiphan.com slash avid slash when um can't say enough good things about these guys
[2145.68 → 2151.78] like wan show can't stay alive because of technical difficulties to being able to like unplug stuff and
[2151.78 → 2158.16] plug it back in while we're going that's right that's right um and finally ant lion audio is sponsoring
[2158.16 → 2165.14] the wan show now this raises a lot of questions question number one why would ant lion want to sponsor
[2165.14 → 2170.36] you guys when every time you feature their product for some reason it sounds worse than when other
[2170.36 → 2176.34] people feature their product so we're super incompetent apparently um actually I know what
[2176.34 → 2183.38] happened last time so last time what happened was we were using the mod mic 5 on like a Sennheiser
[2183.38 → 2189.54] wireless mic pack instead of just like recording into the last time that was the pre-roll that
[2189.54 → 2199.24] I just did so we were using it with sort of non-validated use case and Pella said it was
[2199.24 → 2205.50] fine, and it wasn't fine, and we should have just recorded it into a computer because the funny thing
[2205.50 → 2209.40] about that is that really wouldn't have been that hard no we could have just plugged it into a computer
[2209.40 → 2213.64] and put it on the table and recorded it and synced it up after the fact like that would have been
[2213.64 → 2223.92] fine but anyway uh so the mod mic 5 is a great way to add a decent sounding mic to your existing pair
[2223.92 → 2227.42] of headphones something that is actually kind of difficult to do either you have to put something
[2227.42 → 2232.80] on your desk which can get in your way or a lot of people use like an inline one that's on a cord but
[2232.80 → 2237.72] often those don't work very well especially when you move around, so the mod mic works just like a normal
[2237.72 → 2241.74] boom mic except it just clips it there's a little sticker that goes on the side of your existing
[2241.74 → 2246.36] probably audiophile grade headphones that's what a lot of people use them for and then there's a
[2246.36 → 2251.56] cool little magnetic thing that allows you to flip it up or put it down or even just take it off
[2251.56 → 2258.02] or even just take it off outright one way that okay so the way that I use mine right now is I'm very
[2258.02 → 2263.48] rarely on like voice calls when I'm at my computer desk right at work so it's just disconnected but
[2263.48 → 2268.90] sitting on my desk plugged into an extension cable to my computer so if I ever do need to use it i just
[2268.90 → 2273.14] clip it back on and I don't even I don't even need to just flip it up because I might not use it for
[2273.14 → 2277.64] a couple of days at a time it's got a dual mic capsule for recording flexibility a cable wrap to protect
[2277.64 → 2285.08] your wires and includes the ant lion mute module so you can buy it now for 70 bucks us over at ant lion
[2285.08 → 2291.08] audio's website and oh cool you can enter our giveaway which will be linked in the video description
[2291.08 → 2297.32] uh or right now oh yeah or linked in the twitch chat you got it I got okay um or linked in the
[2297.32 → 2305.24] twitch chat to win one of three mod mic fives or a hi-fi man edition s and mod mic five combo cool
[2305.24 → 2314.48] all right more topics wow every topic we've done has actually been like pretty deep so um if you feel
[2314.48 → 2321.02] like this is the best Wang show of your life you can tweet at jams underscore gravity who pledges
[2321.02 → 2331.62] to 100 reply to every single tweet wow okay please his challenge that his whole life is full of regret
[2331.62 → 2341.16] starting now someone should okay uh we're not encouraging people to use a bot someone should not
[2341.16 → 2348.02] definitely make a bot no, no no I knew you were going to don't do that I said not someone should not
[2348.02 → 2354.30] don't do that make a bot don't do that jams is a good person we hope that would pull from like
[2354.30 → 2363.08] an IntelliJ mesh set don't do that intel response machine learning intel response they're all unique
[2363.08 → 2372.22] to dozen said he'd have no idea by cutting prices on core i5 and core i7 processors wait a minute
[2372.22 → 2378.74] how old is this article February 26th no wait did that ever even happen is this from micro centre
[2378.74 → 2386.36] I think this is just uh oh wait on Amazon hold on okay hold on just a gosh darn
[2386.36 → 2390.72] minute here okay for a micro centre yeah yeah that might just be micro centre doing things hold on
[2390.72 → 2399.58] hold on I'm doing real-time investigative journalism where I see if prices have been dropped
[2399.58 → 2407.30] they have not this is the price of a 7700k ignore that and I will go yell at jams after the Wang show
[2407.30 → 2411.18] wow you should all tweet him with your totally not bots
[2411.18 → 2418.42] that he didn't do that right uh word on the street the original article here is from hot
[2418.42 → 2428.34] hardware the NVIDIA GTX 1080 ti reportedly in production for a march launch reportedly um it's coming out
[2428.34 → 2433.98] next week we know that already wait a minute when is this article from this is from the 20th of
[2433.98 → 2442.50] February jams jams jams okay, okay jams you guys you know what I'm not gonna talk to him, you guys
[2442.50 → 2448.60] talk to him for me okay yeah you guys talk to him okay this is actually new Mike Pence's email hacked
[2448.60 → 2458.40] so the original article from BBC uh Mike Pence was apparently um uh you're storing like public
[2458.40 → 2465.00] like government related stuff on a private email server why is this so common
[2465.00 → 2474.26] and uh oh yep so he used a private he used a private email as the Indiana governor to conduct
[2474.26 → 2481.82] state business now with that said we have to also be careful not to blow this out of proportion
[2481.82 → 2495.48] because my understanding is that that isn't illegal there now um I mean should that be okay no and
[2495.48 → 2500.04] apparently he knew all this while attacking Hillary's email practices which is sort of hilarious
[2500.04 → 2508.18] yes um many of pence's email uh contacts received emails saying Mr pence and his wife
[2508.18 → 2515.12] had become stranded in the Philippines and urgently needed money, so this wasn't like a vigilante like
[2515.12 → 2524.94] they were just trying to make money yeah so that's a thing so um you know personally I'm shocked
[2524.94 → 2531.64] I mean something hypocritical about the Trump administration, and it's, and it's uh members
[2531.64 → 2537.84] that would never happen no I don't believe it yeah googles a Google Assistant AI now available
[2537.84 → 2543.28] for all modern android handsets which is an interesting way of putting that because
[2543.28 → 2551.40] an android handset can be pretty darn modern but not have um android m or n yeah, so there's that you
[2551.40 → 2557.06] can try to figure out how to make it actually answer in a conversational tone like I do um it's a
[2557.06 → 2562.32] little difficult sometimes takes a few shots yeah and the frustrating part is when it decides to end
[2562.32 → 2566.58] the conversation by just giving you a Google search link, and you're like well gotta start from the
[2566.58 → 2572.88] beginning again it's a really good way for that to work voice interaction is like so bad
[2572.88 → 2578.44] like it's one of those things where like this is a big deal because this was a pixel feature
[2578.44 → 2584.22] that for some reason some people cared about, and now it's I thought rolling out what it's going to be
[2584.22 → 2592.68] super cool I'm very excited for private voice activated AI I'm not very excited for cloud yeah
[2592.68 → 2597.28] someone will make it eventually yeah that's way far out, but someone will make it eventually
[2597.28 → 2605.68] the current setups for voice activated AI is scary and sketchy and once like way down the line someone
[2605.68 → 2612.22] makes it private I will set that up all right, so anyway the timing of this is interesting Samsung is
[2612.22 → 2617.14] rumoured to be launching its Bixby assistant on the Galaxy S8 which will probably also be terrible
[2617.14 → 2624.10] um and by the time that launches Google Assistant should also be available on the Galaxy S8 so it'll
[2624.10 → 2631.94] be uh it'll be uh you know game on between the two how do you install assistant just update google play
[2631.94 → 2640.14] services so sounds like you're getting it whether you really want it or not cool nice um all right
[2640.14 → 2652.68] fantastic CBC claims that subway chicken is only 50 percent chicken subway defends its chicken after a CBC
[2652.68 → 2660.86] marketplace report calling the story false and misleading but CBC stands behind the DNA test result
[2660.86 → 2669.26] so they found it was 50 percent soy wow however food scientists have chimed in saying DNA tests
[2669.26 → 2674.72] aren't their preferred method of testing subsequent tests by third parties and subway itself indicate
[2674.72 → 2680.98] the chicken is less than one percent soy apparently that is present due to added spices and marinade
[2680.98 → 2688.50] so there you go now you know have lots of soy in their spices and marinade Ars Technica reports
[2688.50 → 2697.12] and good this was only yesterday good job jams how game mode will make games run better on Windows
[2697.12 → 2707.10] plus details on strict limitations for UWP apps running on the Xbox One so in a nutshell game mode will
[2707.10 → 2713.04] apparently isolate CPU resources to be devoted exclusively to that game process now that's not
[2713.04 → 2718.30] something that I would expect to affect average frame rates much, but it's something that I might expect
[2718.30 → 2724.02] especially on systems that are only marginally able to run a game something that I might expect to
[2724.02 → 2730.44] affect like hiccups so you know and I mean okay this isn't something that I've experienced since like
[2730.44 → 2737.20] the Athlon XP era no maybe at that point okay it's not something I've experienced since like
[2737.20 → 2743.26] the Athlon x2 era, but there would have been times in the past where getting an instant message and having
[2743.26 → 2749.32] something pop up from your uh from your taskbar from your system tray would have caused a game stutter
[2749.32 → 2757.64] yeah it was a long time ago, but theoretically this could help prevent now people run like video
[2757.64 → 2765.00] wallpapers and stuff that's like really common now wallpaper engine it's like a software you can buy on
[2765.00 → 2770.60] steam oh remember like a long time ago when through VLC you could like to set a video as your background
[2770.60 → 2776.70] yeah and uh Windows vista ultimate had that as a feature too yeah, yeah now it's like there's a program
[2776.70 → 2781.56] on steam called I think it's wallpaper engine unfortunately most of them are just like
[2781.56 → 2790.12] weird mostly nude drawn animated girls, but there's a search bar so I found like a really cool titan fall
[2790.12 → 2795.34] helmet when it's doing like the blinking thing after the credits and an assassin's creed flag because
[2795.34 → 2801.78] I haven't changed since I was 18 so here we go wow that was a really cool story
[2801.78 → 2808.88] wonderful um the system moves threads devoted to other processors
[2808.88 → 2814.46] the twitch chat's like unfortunately you can choose whatever you want I won't judge you
[2814.46 → 2820.44] uh the system gives an even greater majority of c of GPU cycles to the active game reducing the time
[2820.44 → 2825.02] available for what is everything else what else is using the GPU like what are you rendering crap in
[2825.02 → 2830.78] adobe media encoder with mercury engine like in the background I mean if you're doing that you
[2830.78 → 2839.18] deserve to have a crappy gaming experience um all right the switch launch is going really well
[2839.18 → 2842.80] apparently they're going to be shipping two million by the end of the month I don't think that's how
[2842.80 → 2847.70] many are sold because a lot of sites are just not taking purchases like you can't even pre you can't
[2847.70 → 2852.40] even like pre-purchase one when they're available almost anywhere because no one knows how much stock
[2852.40 → 2858.72] they're getting because it's Nintendo um but as they've like can such a big company be so disorganized
[2858.72 → 2867.86] yeah as they've already shipped two million units and the Wii U only ever shipped so far 13.56
[2867.86 → 2875.70] around there wow they're doing pretty good compared to the predecessor fascinating yeah all right um
[2875.70 → 2879.52] what else we got here we've got some other interesting topics I think we're nearing the end
[2879.52 → 2886.26] are we could yeah yeah um started mostly oh yeah PSV has sold almost a million units which is
[2886.26 → 2893.34] estimated to be nearly twice that of the rift and the five combined so many people for so long have
[2893.34 → 2898.00] been telling me that in my VR scripts when I talk about how the cost of everything combined is really
[2898.00 → 2905.04] expensive, but the computers are pretty cheap now like no it doesn't matter yeah you're getting into a
[2905.04 → 2910.86] realm of expense which is just too much for so many people it doesn't matter that like it's perfect
[2910.86 → 2916.64] yeah it's like it's like car people you know what car people I find are some of the worst about this
[2916.64 → 2926.18] where they'll be like but a BMW drives so much better and I'll be like wow who cares
[2926.18 → 2932.60] oh well I don't know I mean maybe okay BMW is a bad example because some of their some of their
[2932.60 → 2938.46] lower end stuff is actually somewhat attainable um so what would I compare it to like we
[2938.46 → 2945.06] know someone who's relatively young that has one yeah yeah that's true okay, okay BMW is a bad example
[2945.06 → 2951.60] what how do I okay see as not a car person it's hard for me to even remember the obnoxious car people
[2951.60 → 2961.04] things that okay, okay when when when rear cameras first showed up and people would be like but this is so
[2961.04 → 2967.68] much better and I'd be like right, but that's only available that's only even available on trim levels
[2967.68 → 2973.02] that cost double what the base model does that's more that's more what I'm going for yeah, yeah like
[2973.02 → 2982.00] uh I remember in high school uh one of my one of my friends his mom had a SUV so remember this is back
[2982.00 → 2990.18] in like 2003 had a SUV backup camera back then that's balling she had GPS oh so she had GPS that was like
[2990.18 → 2996.18] built in that was built in, and she had windshield wipers that detected whether there was rain on the
[2996.18 → 3001.54] windshield or not damn and only went if there was like three too much rain like back in 03
[3001.54 → 3008.76] and he's like telling me how great his mom's car is and I'm like cool like it doesn't matter how much
[3008.76 → 3016.10] better it is because I do this or this and turn my windshield wipers on yeah i I don't have you know
[3016.10 → 3023.80] 120 130 grand to spend on a SUV i just I don't have that so it hurts me physically it doesn't matter
[3023.80 → 3034.48] how much better it is um so there that's more the point i was trying to make yeah uh okay so the reason
[3034.48 → 3042.14] why I don't own any cloud connected kids toys so this was uh this was actually I saw this on a tweet from
[3042.14 → 3050.98] uh troy hunt here data from connected cloud pets teddy bears leaked and ransomed exposing kids voice
[3050.98 → 3057.02] messages that's conversations between the child and others can be recorded and forwarded
[3057.82 → 3066.44] dun dun dun looks like a very cute toy and all that but um oh my god my kids do not own anything
[3066.44 → 3072.96] connected to the internet, and they won't until they're old enough to understand what it means
[3072.96 → 3078.98] to have something connected to the internet messages were stored in a Congo database that was pub that
[3078.98 → 3085.42] was in a publicly facing network segment without any authentication required and had been indexed by
[3085.42 → 3096.40] shod an wow over 820 000 users data uh had or over 820 000 users had data exposed 2.2 million
[3096.40 → 3107.04] voice recordings of parents and their children um wow fantastic okay apparently this is probably the
[3107.04 → 3113.26] Samsung Galaxy s8 I haven't actually looked at this, yet apparently it might have a curved screen hey
[3113.26 → 3126.16] and wow no buttons oh wow that's a shame um okay hmm that is a shame missing the physical
[3126.16 → 3132.08] and capacitive blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah the uh did you know that the g6 has a non
[3132.08 → 3138.06] like it has a wider than usual aspect ratio no does this kind of look like it also does sort of does
[3138.06 → 3143.74] i I really hope that looks like a wonky photo yeah okay from what I can, I really hope that doesn't
[3143.74 → 3148.86] turn into a thing I plan to I plan to kind of crap on that in my g6 review which will be coming
[3148.86 → 3159.04] um because we finally achieved it video content and screens being the same shape as we
[3159.04 → 3164.18] waited so long for this for everyone to just kind of get their act together for so first on computers
[3164.18 → 3170.86] we had four by three screens then we had five by four screens for some freaking reason why what anyway
[3170.86 → 3177.70] so we got that then we got 16 by 10 okay so we were getting close I liked that I liked 16 by 10
[3177.70 → 3185.20] too because the black bars were reasonable but I also see why people might prefer to especially as
[3185.20 → 3192.16] screens got bigger to give up a little bit of their relative you know vertical space I would still like
[3192.16 → 3197.18] for no black bars I would, I get it I would still personally like a 16 by 10 but I get it okay
[3197.18 → 3203.66] so so we so we got that far then the only aspect ratio we really got on monitors and I'm
[3203.66 → 3211.34] excluding things like the surface studio or um you know the surface uh Surface Pro like where you know
[3211.34 → 3217.44] like tablets um surfaces all in one yeah basically surfaces okay so other than surfaces monitors we stuck
[3217.44 → 3224.76] with that or recently introduced ultra-wide so 21 by 9 which happens to be very similar to theatrical
[3224.76 → 3231.54] widescreen yeah so there we go TVs, and it's drastically different TVs monitors and then
[3231.54 → 3238.80] apple finally did it with the iPhone 6 so TVs monitors and mobile devices other than tablets
[3238.80 → 3249.44] all went 16 by 9 and everything was Buenos and nobody had black bars we don't need to move away from
[3249.44 → 3255.16] from that 16 by 9 is fine yes it's fine there 's's no compelling reason that I can think of to
[3255.16 → 3266.58] change it um Sony this is actually really cool debuts the world's fastest SD cards up to around 300
[3266.58 → 3269.36] megabytes wow nanotech has those now
[3269.36 → 3281.24] dang it dr buttress um write speeds of 299 megabytes per second how sad they couldn't get
[3281.24 → 3285.92] was the engineer one more who couldn't squeeze one more megabyte per second out of it
[3285.92 → 3294.76] poor guy how sad was he or she um so there you go up to 128 gigabyte capacities
[3294.76 → 3303.12] and as long as the reader is uhs2 compliant they are able to handle almost 300 megabytes per second
[3303.12 → 3311.24] reads and writes this is getting up to around SATA 2 like saturating wait yes saturating SATA 2 speeds
[3311.24 → 3317.70] that is fantastic they're not saying how they're getting that in a SD card only saying that it is
[3317.70 → 3326.30] enabled by firmware just like okay thanks, but the cards are also waterproof shockproof temperature
[3326.30 → 3332.66] resistant and x-ray proof cool they're announcing a card reader specifically built for them with
[3332.66 → 3341.98] built-in super speed USB 3.1 gen 1 that should leave standard SD slots in the dust uh oh what time is it
[3341.98 → 3348.82] oh, oh wow oh oh oh oh we should uh we should uh we should talk about flow plane club hooray
[3348.82 → 3353.94] hooray do the thing do you have anything exciting to share with anybody I'm putting you on the spot
[3353.94 → 3359.92] a little bit the the the website version has a password reset that works now okay that's exciting
[3359.92 → 3366.24] yeah I mean they're okay the uh website version that definitely doesn't exist I mean we could share
[3366.24 → 3371.92] that I guess now that we spilled the beans on it no, no oh because they'd see that no, no no, no
[3371.92 → 3376.70] not to show it to them no, no just that it will that there will be one oh yeah okay because i
[3376.70 → 3382.24] actually had some people asking um in the float plane club like private I haven't I haven't been like
[3382.24 → 3388.82] announcing it but I haven't been hiding it okay so we've had people asking will float plane club
[3388.82 → 3395.02] always be and here's what it looks like now so this is float plane club will it be always a Jacky
[3395.02 → 3404.48] subforum on the Linus tech tips website no definitely not uh development is very actively
[3404.48 → 3415.04] happening um Luke is working on it and x saying in slightly under now three months ah okay and
[3415.04 → 3423.24] possibly allegedly we might have also someone else working on it um that person's currently on probation
[3423.24 → 3430.22] but that's like that's just like bc law that's not because like we hate to hate them that's just
[3430.22 → 3435.34] sort of how that works that's just kind of how it works yeah um but this is definitely a real
[3435.34 → 3441.92] development project it is definitely happening and uh the way that you sign up is you go to the store
[3441.92 → 3448.12] on the Linus tech tips' forum so I'll show you guys what that looks like, and then you go to float plane
[3448.12 → 3454.08] club actually all the other contributor tiers are also had access to float plane club but for now
[3454.08 → 3460.18] they don't actually have a ton of benefit beyond that you get a fancy badge and access to the
[3460.18 → 3465.24] the tier exclusive subforum yeah the only one of which that matters are the bronze one because we have
[3465.24 → 3470.76] a counting thread in there, and we count by images so the image that you post has to have the number in
[3470.76 → 3475.32] it I contributed a thing there yeah it was hilarious I forget what it was but I thought it was really
[3475.32 → 3479.72] funny I think I saw it and I think I enjoyed it a lot of them are good it's it seems like people
[3479.72 → 3486.18] genuinely like take time to find one that's sort of cool yeah um we're at like almost I think we're
[3486.18 → 3493.82] at like 850 is hor something so basically you sign up in the store, and you can see uh up here there
[3493.82 → 3499.26] you go there's a float plane club link that goes in there and from the counting threads in chat oh
[3499.26 → 3504.98] excellent, and then you get access to a week's worth of content and there's other stuff that we have
[3504.98 → 3510.82] planned for it as well so all what we already have working is there's a week's worth of releases
[3510.82 → 3518.94] that are not on YouTube yet and then what we also have working is that the bit rates are higher at a
[3518.94 → 3523.66] given resolution it looks better on full plane so it looks better and for a lot of people more
[3523.66 → 3529.00] importantly actually sounds better so we don't compress the audio very much at all um let's see
[3529.00 → 3535.96] so what do we have on here that is not on YouTube yet server room update vlog is there
[3535.96 → 3542.56] um we can maybe explain why that's not on YouTube yeah so oh yeah a lot of people have asked
[3542.56 → 3548.26] us like what's the deal with sometimes the early access platform having stuff for two or three weeks
[3548.26 → 3553.02] before it hits YouTube and what happens sometimes is when we do a simultaneous release
[3553.02 → 3559.38] in order to not screw up our calendar planning um because we won't launch two videos in a day on
[3559.38 → 3565.18] YouTube that's not going to happen it what happens is it causes the first video to like get
[3565.18 → 3573.02] buried a little bit of cascading yeah um so like this week with like dozen 1080ti Nintendo Switch which
[3573.02 → 3580.04] I believe is coming out tomorrow night uh tomorrow like noon yeah okay tomorrow like midday yeah um
[3580.04 → 3584.40] or maybe slightly earlier I might stomp on wan show and just hit it a little bit earlier but uh basically
[3584.40 → 3589.80] uh what happens is that if we do a simultaneous release YouTube already got a video that day
[3589.80 → 3595.20] so that one actually gets pushed down an entire additional week because on a normal week we would
[3595.20 → 3602.68] only do maybe one or maybe two simultaneous releases so we can't just like bump it to the next day because
[3602.68 → 3607.70] then it screws up like that one that screws up everything until we can reset it the following week so
[3607.70 → 3614.06] so that's the way that works so anyway what's on there now is the server room update vlog part three finale
[3614.06 → 3624.86] um Luke's not so secret obsession analog NT mini yes we've got Windows 9 the OS Microsoft won't tell you about
[3624.86 → 3631.54] uh we've got one about VGA's new thermal solution for their cards where they've they believe and
[3631.54 → 3636.26] kind of actually looks pretty good um that they've solved card overheating problems once and for all
[3636.26 → 3644.36] uh we've got uh a rundown of every AMD Radeon card tested look at that thumbnail look at how his mouth
[3644.36 → 3651.90] is open look at how look at how we blew up the size of all the video cards so that they'd be bigger
[3651.90 → 3658.82] no, no so I held them out like that I really did, but they would only be like this big like look at how
[3658.82 → 3663.14] like think about how big a video card is relative to my hand yeah that's pretty good I think ed did
[3663.14 → 3670.84] it is nice um and then check this out there's so it's AMD video cards through the ages, so there's uh a clock
[3670.84 → 3677.28] and a dinosaur it's really subtle though we're still working on this whole time with our clickbait
[3677.28 → 3682.92] yeah that's right so there you go that's how it works it's a video player just like you would expect
[3682.92 → 3688.52] a video player to be its good we've even got cool features like check this out see we have thumbnail
[3688.52 → 3694.04] uh thumbnail preview so you can skip to the part of the video where check this out this is amazing
[3694.04 → 3698.86] oh god card on the left photoshopped in what
[3698.86 → 3708.30] taken did it photoshopped we didn't have one oh my god even the shadow is fake so I think he
[3708.30 → 3713.80] like pulled chunks of this shadow and like put it over there and then good job there yeah it's like
[3713.80 → 3718.12] just it's I don't even know if this is an it's a photograph I think this is like a render off of
[3718.12 → 3727.16] AMD's like press kit holy crap yeah um the press kit yeah the 2900 XT yeah that's pretty sick yeah so
[3727.16 → 3734.64] anyway um got lots of videos over there, and we've got lots and lots of plans for this in the future
[3734.64 → 3741.04] it's going to be a pretty freaking unbelievable platform we hope um, but there's a lot of work to
[3741.04 → 3746.08] be done, and we're not even answering questions about when it'll launch um what is really cool
[3746.08 → 3752.62] is do we want to talk about how we added more capacity nope oh okay nope okay we didn't just
[3752.62 → 3757.68] don't even want to nope there's a website coming we're working on it a lot there's a website coming
[3757.68 → 3763.00] we're working on it a lot there 's's some serious infrastructure involved in serving the number
[3763.00 → 3769.42] of people that we're serving on float plane club which what I'll say is that it's probably more than
[3769.42 → 3778.20] you think that's all I can really say yeah in fact there's I pretty much guarantee it is more people
[3778.20 → 3783.90] than you think and um there's been some challenges but I think I demonstrated the responsiveness of the
[3783.90 → 3788.04] player there's still like that weird itchiness when we change resolutions like it goes back to
[3788.04 → 3793.52] the thumbnail for a second but then like it's pretty fast yeah um yeah we're really excited about
[3793.52 → 3799.98] team's been working really hard thank you know who you are yeah do you know who you are no
[3799.98 → 3806.16] existential questions I don't even know who you are got how did you get in here get out of
[3806.16 → 3810.92] get out of here thanks for watching the wan show guys we'll see you again next week same bad time same bad
