[0.00 → 2.00] What?
[2.00 → 6.00] So we left, and we came back, and we're still so early!
[6.00 → 8.00] It's still Thursday!
[8.00 → 9.00] Whoa!
[9.00 → 10.00] Whoa!
[10.00 → 11.00] Oh my god!
[11.00 → 13.00] We're a whole day early!
[13.00 → 14.00] Yeah!
[14.00 → 15.00] It's amazing!
[15.00 → 17.00] And we have water, that's cool.
[17.00 → 18.00] Right?
[18.00 → 23.00] This is the earliest the WAN show has ever been!
[23.00 → 28.00] Yeah, if we were super popular YouTubers, I would just smash this on the ground and then get tons of more views.
[28.00 → 29.00] It's not a thing now.
[29.00 → 30.00] That's a thing, yeah.
[30.00 → 31.00] What?
[31.00 → 32.00] Why?
[32.00 → 35.00] But we are just very, not super.
[35.00 → 37.00] Yeah, we're just mostly popular.
[37.00 → 38.00] Yeah!
[38.00 → 39.00] The whole Princess Bride thing.
[39.00 → 41.00] Mostly popular and ridiculously on time.
[41.00 → 43.00] Dead or mostly dead?
[43.00 → 46.00] We're just mostly, we're mostly dead memes.
[48.00 → 55.00] So we are taking the longest long weekend of all Linus Media Group time.
[55.00 → 56.00] Minus me.
[56.00 → 57.00] Except you.
[57.00 → 58.00] Yeah.
[58.00 → 68.00] We're taking Friday and Monday off, so we decided to stream on Thursday so that everyone, except Luke, who works at a different company now, good for him.
[68.00 → 69.00] Yay!
[69.00 → 70.00] Except in this case.
[70.00 → 71.00] Never time off.
[71.00 → 72.00] Where it's bad for him.
[72.00 → 73.00] Yeah.
[73.00 → 76.00] And you're working, you're still working the Friday, right?
[76.00 → 77.00] Yep.
[77.00 → 78.00] Monday off though?
[78.00 → 79.00] Monday's a stat, isn't it?
[79.00 → 80.00] No.
[80.00 → 81.00] Not everywhere.
[81.00 → 82.00] Oh, right.
[82.00 → 85.00] National holidays!
[85.00 → 86.00] Really?
[86.00 → 89.00] Half of my full-time force is not in Canada.
[89.00 → 90.00] Right.
[90.00 → 91.00] So, there you go.
[91.00 → 92.00] What national holiday is it?
[92.00 → 93.00] I don't know.
[93.00 → 94.00] It's something.
[94.00 → 95.00] I don't know.
[95.00 → 96.00] It's a stat though.
[96.00 → 97.00] Is it?
[97.00 → 98.00] Isn't it?
[98.00 → 99.00] Is it even?
[99.00 → 101.00] Have I been fooled by all the other staff?
[101.00 → 102.00] I'm pretty sure it's a stat.
[102.00 → 103.00] Canada stat holidays.
[103.00 → 105.00] We're horrible Canadians.
[105.00 → 109.00] HHH, good for- I'm pretty sure it isn't good Friday.
[109.00 → 111.00] Hold on, there are 16 more rows.
[111.00 → 112.00] Oh, God.
[112.00 → 113.00] Valentine's Day.
[113.00 → 117.00] How is Valentine's Day a stat?
[117.00 → 118.00] Oh yes.
[118.00 → 119.00] Civic holiday.
[119.00 → 120.00] What does that mean?
[120.00 → 121.00] Oh, it's BC day.
[121.00 → 123.00] Ahhh, BC day.
[123.00 → 126.00] And then they all have liked their own-so that's why we don't know.
[126.00 → 129.00] So Quebec doesn't get the day off.
[129.00 → 130.00] B-b-bam!
[130.00 → 131.00] Oh hey!
[131.00 → 132.00] I didn't even realize that.
[132.00 → 133.00] Yeah.
[133.00 → 134.00] Yeah, we're just literally all working.
[134.00 → 135.00] It's not even national.
[135.00 → 137.00] There you go!
[137.00 → 140.00] So I can't take the day off because no one else is.
[140.00 → 141.00] And that's stupid.
[141.00 → 143.00] Well, it's- it's rough.
[143.00 → 145.00] But I don't have to like to come to work.
[145.00 → 147.00] So I can sit in like my boxers at home.
[147.00 → 148.00] Okay.
[148.00 → 149.00] And just like work on float plane.
[149.00 → 150.00] So it's kind of like, that's nice.
[150.00 → 151.00] Yeah.
[151.00 → 153.00] So it's like- it's like casual day.
[153.00 → 154.00] Yeah.
[154.00 → 157.00] Yeah, except you can actually just have your junk hanging out.
[157.00 → 158.00] Uh, yeah.
[158.00 → 159.00] Cool.
[159.00 → 162.00] So it's like very casual day.
[162.00 → 165.00] Okay, so here's something that I want to know.
[165.00 → 166.00] Yeah.
[166.00 → 168.00] And we'll get into-okay, no hold on, let's introduce-
[168.00 → 169.00] No, no, we'll get into the topic for a little.
[169.00 → 170.00] This is very important.
[170.00 → 171.00] Okay.
[171.00 → 172.00] Alright.
[172.00 → 173.00] Okay.
[173.00 → 176.00] Now we all know PC culture, right?
[176.00 → 177.00] Okay.
[177.00 → 178.00] Right?
[178.00 → 179.00] Everything's politically correct now.
[179.00 → 180.00] Yeah, yeah.
[180.00 → 181.00] There's no- you can't-
[181.00 → 183.00] See, I wasn't actually sure if you're talking about personal computer or politically correct.
[183.00 → 184.00] No, no.
[184.00 → 186.00] Of course, I'm not going to ask obvious questions.
[186.00 → 187.00] Okay.
[187.00 → 188.00] Okay.
[188.00 → 191.00] And you can't discriminate based on anything.
[191.00 → 192.00] Do I have something on my head?
[192.00 → 194.00] But what if the person's a nudist?
[194.00 → 195.00] But-okay.
[195.00 → 196.00] So if you had-
[196.00 → 198.00] You can have dress code though.
[198.00 → 200.00] If you had a ca- but- but hold on, hold on.
[200.00 → 201.00] This is what I want to know.
[201.00 → 202.00] This is what I want to know.
[202.00 → 203.00] Okay.
[203.00 → 204.00] Look, look.
[204.00 → 205.00] If you had a casual Friday-
[205.00 → 206.00] Okay.
[206.00 → 209.00] And you did not have a company dress code.
[209.00 → 210.00] Which we don't.
[210.00 → 213.00] And somebody showed up naked.
[213.00 → 216.00] And there was no policy in place.
[216.00 → 217.00] Is it discriminatory-
[217.00 → 220.00] It's still- it's still technically a government sanction though.
[220.00 → 221.00] Is it?
[221.00 → 222.00] Well, yeah.
[222.00 → 223.00] Because it's indecency.
[223.00 → 224.00] Oh, it is!
[224.00 → 225.00] Yeah.
[225.00 → 226.00] There's a law for that.
[226.00 → 227.00] Indecency.
[227.00 → 228.00] Yeah.
[228.00 → 229.00] Ah!
[229.00 → 233.00] And then there's the floppy back and forth law thing where like-
[233.00 → 241.00] Uh, certain-like, I- in- in most areas I think, women can't have their tops completely off because you can't show your nipples.
[241.00 → 243.00] But then in some places you're allowed.
[243.00 → 244.00] Like on Twitch.
[244.00 → 245.00] Yes.
[245.00 → 248.00] But then I believe in Vancouver, you can't.
[248.00 → 251.00] Because of what's her face? Linda-whatever her name was.
[251.00 → 252.00] Something. Yeah.
[252.00 → 255.00] There was some like nudist protester who was always all over the place topless.
[255.00 → 256.00] And then they were just like, whatever, we don't care.
[256.00 → 257.00] And then I think in New York-
[257.00 → 258.00] They gave up on arresting her I think.
[258.00 → 259.00] It's the same thing, I think.
[259.00 → 260.00] I'm not really sure.
[260.00 → 261.00] Ah!
[261.00 → 262.00] And there are other areas where it's okay.
[262.00 → 263.00] Okay, okay, okay.
[263.00 → 267.00] So like, I think you'd be able to like, just have bottoms on.
[267.00 → 268.00] In most places.
[268.00 → 269.00] Got it.
[269.00 → 271.00] I don't know.
[271.00 → 272.00] Fascinating.
[272.00 → 273.00] I don't actually-
[273.00 → 274.00] Okay.
[274.00 → 276.00] So we've actually got a lot of great topics for you today.
[276.00 → 277.00] Tons of them.
[277.00 → 279.00] Competition is great for the industry.
[279.00 → 280.00] Yes.
[280.00 → 284.00] NVIDIA claims 3x performance with a new driver update for the Titan XP.
[284.00 → 287.00] I wonder what prompted that driver update.
[287.00 → 291.00] Just to be clear, because I really hate when these things are vague, because it drives me freaking insane.
[291.00 → 293.00] It's 3x performance in specific applications.
[293.00 → 294.00] Not games.
[294.00 → 295.00] Not games.
[295.00 → 296.00] Yeah.
[296.00 → 300.00] AMD clarifies why Thread ripper uses four dies on the chip.
[300.00 → 301.00] What else we got?
[301.00 → 303.00] GTX 1070 killer.
[303.00 → 304.00] It's a killer!
[304.00 → 305.00] ROUGH!
[305.00 → 308.00] Rx Vega 56 benchmarks leaked!
[308.00 → 309.00] ROUGH!
[309.00 → 310.00] Again!
[310.00 → 312.00] Like everything else from every other company.
[312.00 → 313.00] Because everything gets leaked.
[313.00 → 314.00] ROUGH!
[314.00 → 315.00] Because that's- that's advertising.
[315.00 → 316.00] Right now.
[316.00 → 317.00] It leaked!
[317.00 → 318.00] No.
[318.00 → 320.00] It leaked all over the place!
[320.00 → 321.00] Oh my god!
[321.00 → 323.00] Did you do that on purpose?
[323.00 → 325.00] It's really hot, so I wouldn't be surprised.
[325.00 → 326.00] I actually am feeling pretty good right now.
[326.00 → 327.00] Yeah, yeah.
[327.00 → 328.00] I'm going to get some ice water down the front of the shirt.
[328.00 → 329.00] Yeah.
[329.00 → 330.00] There you go.
[330.00 → 333.00] Rx Vega prices and bundles have been confirmed.
[333.00 → 334.00] Leaked confirmed.
[334.00 → 335.00] Leaked confirmed.
[335.00 → 336.00] Leaked confirmed.
[336.00 → 337.00] Whatever.
[337.00 → 338.00] Leaked firmed.
[338.00 → 339.00] Welcome to the news.
[339.00 → 340.00] Firmly leaked.
[340.00 → 341.00] Firm.
[341.00 → 342.00] That was firmly leaked.
[342.00 → 343.00] And it's intro time.
[343.00 → 344.00] That was firmly leaked.
[344.00 → 348.00] It's gonna cause some firm leakage on my side.
[348.00 → 352.00] I wish I wasn't drinking.
[352.00 → 356.00] I wish you weren't drinking at work too, but what can I do about it?
[356.00 → 357.00] Casual Thirsty!
[357.00 → 358.00] Casual Thirsty!
[358.00 → 359.00] Yeah!
[359.00 → 360.00] Yeah!
[360.00 → 362.00] No, I don't drink.
[362.00 → 366.00] Oh, you drink water.
[366.00 → 367.00] Yes.
[367.00 → 368.00] Cool Lazars!
[368.00 → 369.00] Squarespace!
[369.00 → 370.00] Savage!
[370.00 → 372.00] Leaking jerky!
[372.00 → 373.00] Aw.
[373.00 → 374.00] No, that's not what it is.
[374.00 → 375.00] No.
[375.00 → 376.00] Oh boy.
[376.00 → 377.00] You know what?
[377.00 → 380.00] This is going to be a fun show because it has-
[380.00 → 381.00] Great show.
[381.00 → 382.00] It was a short week.
[382.00 → 383.00] Yes.
[383.00 → 386.00] But it was already a hell of a week.
[386.00 → 387.00] I shot my first-
[387.00 → 388.00] My brain is like fried.
[388.00 → 390.00] Cinema graph this week.
[390.00 → 391.00] Oh, those are cool.
[391.00 → 392.00] Yeah.
[392.00 → 393.00] What were you doing?
[393.00 → 394.00] Okay, so-
[394.00 → 395.00] Or what was going on?
[395.00 → 397.00] Hopefully none of this is embargoed or anything.
[397.00 → 398.00] Okay.
[398.00 → 406.00] But MSI actually sent a photo crew out here from like, I don't know, the kind of director,
[406.00 → 409.00] the art director, the art director was from Sweden.
[409.00 → 410.00] And she was hilarious.
[410.00 → 413.00] She was like the most stereotypically Swedish woman I've ever met.
[413.00 → 418.00] With like the hair and the like curly thing and the flower and fricking everything.
[418.00 → 419.00] She was delightful.
[419.00 → 422.00] Um, and you know what?
[422.00 → 425.00] She came with complete instructions and didn't fall apart in two weeks.
[425.00 → 426.00] Go figure.
[426.00 → 427.00] Go figure.
[427.00 → 428.00] Go figure.
[428.00 → 429.00] Anyway.
[429.00 → 435.00] Um, so, so she had me, they actually used a lot of our equipment, which was cool.
[435.00 → 436.00] It made me feel very professional.
[436.00 → 437.00] Yeah.
[437.00 → 438.00] But like this like-
[438.00 → 439.00] We had these things available.
[439.00 → 440.00] Yeah.
[440.00 → 443.00] This baller photo crew that travels around the world, you know, doing professional shoots
[443.00 → 445.00] and stuff was like, oh yeah, that's pretty good equipment.
[445.00 → 446.00] Maybe we'll use that.
[446.00 → 447.00] They even used our green screen, which was pretty cool.
[447.00 → 448.00] Yeah.
[448.00 → 452.00] So they had me set up in front of the green screen, and they had me do like these, like
[452.00 → 454.00] these little like actions.
[454.00 → 461.00] Like I was supposed to be like, like looking off to the side and like, cause the rest of
[461.00 → 462.00] the frame will be still.
[462.00 → 465.00] And if you're not familiar with what a cinema graph is, it's-
[465.00 → 466.00] There's some really cool ones.
[466.00 → 467.00] I can try to pick them up while you talk.
[467.00 → 468.00] Yeah.
[468.00 → 469.00] If you want to grab a couple, is your screen sharing working?
[469.00 → 470.00] Yes it is.
[470.00 → 471.00] Oh, fantastic.
[471.00 → 476.00] So most of the frame is still, but then selectively there's a little bit of motion.
[476.00 → 478.00] So it's actually an MSI here.
[478.00 → 479.00] I'll flip over to you.
[479.00 → 480.00] So there you go.
[480.00 → 483.00] So she's still, the wall's still, but the bubbles blow.
[483.00 → 484.00] Yeah.
[484.00 → 485.00] Which is pretty cool.
[485.00 → 487.00] There's another really cool one.
[487.00 → 490.00] If you go down, this one's perfect.
[490.00 → 491.00] This one's perfect.
[491.00 → 493.00] Yeah.
[493.00 → 497.00] So the mug steams, but everything else is completely still.
[497.00 → 502.00] And it's not like, like nothing in here would naturally move, but it's not like there's mostly
[502.00 → 503.00] no movement.
[503.00 → 505.00] There's actually none, except for the steam.
[505.00 → 506.00] Yeah.
[506.00 → 512.00] So what's supposed to go on in this one is I'm supposed to have the MSI infinite a gaming
[512.00 → 518.00] PC, like hovering under my hand, like some wizard, wizard stuff.
[518.00 → 523.00] And then I'm supposed to like look at it and then like slightly glance to the camera.
[523.00 → 528.00] But everything about me will be maybe still, or maybe they'll put a little bit of our movement
[528.00 → 530.00] to like be manipulating this like spinning PC.
[530.00 → 533.00] And yeah, I'm, I don't know.
[533.00 → 538.00] It was like an hour of, it was an hour of shooting with just me.
[538.00 → 543.00] And then they had like another two hours with the system and with, they're actually going
[543.00 → 545.00] to do it in our workshop set.
[545.00 → 549.00] So I'm not going to be in like some weird location or something.
[549.00 → 551.00] So here's a here's another example.
[551.00 → 552.00] It's loading.
[552.00 → 553.00] Loading!
[553.00 → 554.00] Ugh.
[554.00 → 555.00] Wow.
[555.00 → 561.00] Uh, this is not a great way to go Twitter.
[561.00 → 562.00] Way to go Twitter.
[562.00 → 564.00] But this is a Racer Cinema graph.
[564.00 → 565.00] Yeah, so the idea is what-
[565.00 → 568.00] Where like the guy doesn't move, but like the colours change.
[568.00 → 569.00] Oh, uh, whoops, we're on me.
[569.00 → 573.00] Except it just, it keeps like loading and freezing because-
[573.00 → 574.00] Yeah.
[574.00 → 575.00] I don't know.
[575.00 → 576.00] Either Twitter or our Wi-Fi.
[576.00 → 577.00] So it's like that, but better.
[577.00 → 578.00] Yeah.
[578.00 → 579.00] Yeah.
[579.00 → 580.00] Pretty much.
[580.00 → 581.00] Sweet.
[581.00 → 582.00] Um.
[582.00 → 583.00] But they're cool.
[583.00 → 584.00] So that was fun.
[584.00 → 585.00] What were you up to this week?
[585.00 → 586.00] This week?
[586.00 → 587.00] Wow.
[587.00 → 588.00] Wow!
[588.00 → 589.00] Um, I hired someone.
[589.00 → 590.00] Wow.
[590.00 → 597.00] I thought I got and then like didn't really get, but maybe still he's going to message
[597.00 → 599.00] me later a domain thing.
[599.00 → 600.00] Right.
[600.00 → 601.00] Yeah.
[601.00 → 602.00] Have you heard from him about it not working?
[602.00 → 603.00] I heard from him.
[603.00 → 606.00] He said he's going to check his email, but he hasn't done it yet.
[606.00 → 607.00] So we'll see.
[607.00 → 610.00] Um, ah, puff.
[610.00 → 611.00] What did I do?
[611.00 → 615.00] I was very busy, but I'm trying to remember everything that I did.
[615.00 → 618.00] Figured out some weird stuff with some tax things.
[618.00 → 621.00] Figured out that maybe we have to go to America.
[621.00 → 625.00] Um, balancing the pros and cons of just straight-up moving to Quebec.
[625.00 → 628.00] Um, there's been a lot of, it's been a lot of weird stuff.
[628.00 → 629.00] You'll have to speak French.
[629.00 → 630.00] No.
[630.00 → 631.00] I can't.
[631.00 → 636.00] This will have to speak French.
[636.00 → 638.00] Oh, Lord.
[638.00 → 639.00] They will hate you.
[639.00 → 640.00] Yes.
[640.00 → 641.00] Especially because my last name.
[641.00 → 642.00] I will actually be lynched.
[642.00 → 648.00] Anglophones that move over there and like straight up are like, hello.
[648.00 → 649.00] Bonjour.
[649.00 → 652.00] I would like to order waffles.
[652.00 → 654.00] JE Vouvrays l's waffles.
[654.00 → 656.00] Like, no.
[656.00 → 657.00] No.
[657.00 → 658.00] They're going to hate you.
[658.00 → 663.00] I'm going to have to, I'm going to have to like, get all my food delivered from Amazon.
[663.00 → 666.00] Or just buy it at Costco and literally never say a word.
[666.00 → 670.00] I've gotten through certain foreign countries that way, but it's like pretending I'm mute.
[670.00 → 673.00] And just being like, I know how all this stuff works.
[673.00 → 677.00] And just like being obvious about things and then just never talking and just, it works.
[677.00 → 678.00] It's fine.
[678.00 → 679.00] Quebec?
[679.00 → 680.00] No.
[680.00 → 681.00] Oh my god.
[681.00 → 683.00] Is that, is that the joke?
[683.00 → 684.00] French yes.
[684.00 → 685.00] Oh my god.
[685.00 → 686.00] Oh no.
[686.00 → 687.00] Oh man.
[687.00 → 689.00] But like, yeah, okay.
[689.00 → 690.00] Seriously, right now.
[690.00 → 693.00] And there are some theories and A Prime actually has a very good theory.
[693.00 → 694.00] EW!
[694.00 → 695.00] Are we so big English?
[695.00 → 697.00] You are stupid English people at Linus Tech.
[697.00 → 698.00] Yeah.
[698.00 → 699.00] Yeah.
[699.00 → 700.00] Yeah.
[700.00 → 701.00] Some of you do.
[701.00 → 702.00] Yeah.
[702.00 → 703.00] If you go to Montreal, sure.
[703.00 → 704.00] Yeah.
[704.00 → 709.00] But you make your way out into the Burns, and it's a whole other story.
[709.00 → 710.00] Yeah.
[710.00 → 720.00] So, um, I've been looking through resumes and a very, very large, like 75, 80, 85% of the
[720.00 → 723.00] strong resumes are from Montreal.
[723.00 → 724.00] Really?
[724.00 → 727.00] Or Quebec or, or Quebec City or, or Verdun or wherever.
[727.00 → 731.00] There are quite a few different areas, but it's all in Quebec to some degree.
[731.00 → 732.00] A huge percentage of it.
[732.00 → 733.00] Interesting.
[733.00 → 734.00] And not even just programmers.
[734.00 → 737.00] A lot of different talent that I'm looking for seems to be over there.
[737.00 → 738.00] And A Prime's theory.
[738.00 → 741.00] Is it because the English-speaking ones are moving to the States to make more money?
[741.00 → 743.00] That's A Prime's theory is the Francophones don't want to move.
[743.00 → 745.00] Ah.
[745.00 → 746.00] Ohhhhh.
[746.00 → 751.00] I need a cigarette.
[751.00 → 753.00] A really long one.
[753.00 → 759.00] So like, like perfect programmers from other parts of the country that are English
[759.00 → 760.00] main speaking.
[760.00 → 761.00] Right.
[761.00 → 764.00] Either like move to the States, or everyone else move to the States so they stay here and
[764.00 → 766.00] get paid ludicrous amounts of money.
[766.00 → 767.00] Right.
[767.00 → 768.00] Fascinating.
[768.00 → 769.00] Alright.
[769.00 → 770.00] Yeah.
[770.00 → 771.00] I don't know.
[771.00 → 772.00] Pre-recorded, yes.
[772.00 → 773.00] Uh, technically no.
[773.00 → 775.00] We are actually very live right now.
[775.00 → 778.00] We were thinking of spoofing you guys and just like playing this on Friday and then we
[778.00 → 779.00] were like, ah!
[779.00 → 780.00] YOLO.
[780.00 → 781.00] Whatever.
[781.00 → 782.00] Yep.
[782.00 → 783.00] Alright.
[783.00 → 787.00] So, um, should we do an actual tech topic here?
[787.00 → 788.00] I mean we can.
[788.00 → 789.00] I mean this one's pretty interesting.
[789.00 → 794.00] May underscore settings on the forum was the original poster for this.
[794.00 → 795.00] The Titan-
[795.00 → 796.00] Did the typo?
[796.00 → 797.00] Is that supposed to be max settings?
[797.00 → 802.00] I don't even, you know what, maybe it's like a maybe it's a Star Wars reference.
[802.00 → 803.00] Okay.
[803.00 → 805.00] But isn't that MOZ?
[805.00 → 812.00] Which doesn't make any sense, but, um, I, I, you know what, just whatever.
[812.00 → 813.00] Um.
[813.00 → 815.00] Did I just correct you on a Star Wars thing?
[815.00 → 822.00] I have very much and very deep Star Wars knowledge.
[822.00 → 823.00] I know.
[823.00 → 824.00] None of it is canon anymore.
[824.00 → 825.00] Oh.
[825.00 → 826.00] And it's all old.
[826.00 → 827.00] Okay.
[827.00 → 828.00] Yeah.
[828.00 → 829.00] Alright.
[829.00 → 833.00] You wanna talk, you want to talk Grand Admiral Thrawn, Mary Jade, fine.
[833.00 → 834.00] Grand Admiral Thrawn's canon.
[834.00 → 835.00] Is he canon?
[835.00 → 836.00] Yeah.
[836.00 → 837.00] Shut up.
[837.00 → 838.00] He's canon.
[838.00 → 839.00] Oh, hell yeah.
[839.00 → 842.00] The new, the new animated series, Rebels, is like, long.
[842.00 → 843.00] Is that, that storyline?
[843.00 → 844.00] Grand Admiral Thrawn.
[844.00 → 851.00] Thank goodness, cause like, out of all the like, legions of Star Wars writers, Timothy
[851.00 → 852.00] Hahn must be the best.
[852.00 → 853.00] Yeah.
[853.00 → 856.00] No, he's super stoked right now because it's like a show about his character.
[856.00 → 857.00] That's fantastic.
[857.00 → 861.00] Yeah, and it's like actually really cool cause it brings a more dynamic character into Star Wars
[861.00 → 862.00] universe and stuff.
[862.00 → 864.00] Did they somewhat stick to the...
[864.00 → 868.00] I see, I'm, I like binge-watching a show.
[868.00 → 869.00] So you haven't started it.
[869.00 → 870.00] No.
[870.00 → 871.00] Okay.
[871.00 → 872.00] Got it.
[872.00 → 873.00] But I know that he's there.
[873.00 → 874.00] So.
[874.00 → 875.00] Yeah.
[875.00 → 876.00] Okay.
[876.00 → 877.00] Okay.
[877.00 → 878.00] Alright.
[878.00 → 881.00] And like, okay, I have heard from the writer that he really appreciates the depiction
[881.00 → 882.00] of his character.
[882.00 → 883.00] Yeah.
[883.00 → 885.00] So they must have stuck with how he was.
[885.00 → 886.00] Fantastic.
[886.00 → 887.00] Yeah.
[887.00 → 888.00] Well I am stoked on that.
[888.00 → 890.00] I, you know what's another one that's...
[890.00 → 892.00] Someone in the chat said all the books are canon?
[892.00 → 893.00] No.
[893.00 → 894.00] No, they're super not.
[894.00 → 895.00] No.
[895.00 → 897.00] Um, I would, okay, I, we'll get back to Titan X in a minute.
[897.00 → 899.00] Um, cause this is more important.
[899.00 → 907.00] Uh, you know what's another really great opportunity for, um, for, for, for adaptations
[907.00 → 911.00] to film is, have you read the Tales from the Mo's Sisley Cantina?
[911.00 → 912.00] No.
[912.00 → 913.00] Or Cantina?
[913.00 → 914.00] Whatever it is.
[914.00 → 915.00] No.
[915.00 → 916.00] It's perfect.
[916.00 → 917.00] It's just a collection of short stories.
[917.00 → 919.00] In fact, I think it's from a bunch of different writers.
[919.00 → 920.00] Oh, that's cool.
[920.00 → 921.00] But like, some well known ones.
[921.00 → 922.00] Like, I think Kevin, Kevin J. Anderson is one of them.
[922.00 → 924.00] So it's like, Silmarillion for Star Wars, sort of?
[924.00 → 927.00] It's, it's the backstories of like, everyone who's in there.
[927.00 → 928.00] Oh, that's cool.
[928.00 → 929.00] Yeah, it's actually pretty cool.
[929.00 → 931.00] Oh, so that's how people know about like, the doctor and stuff.
[931.00 → 932.00] Yeah.
[932.00 → 935.00] Cause like, I know some of those like, factoids, but I haven't-
[935.00 → 936.00] Yes.
[936.00 → 937.00] That makes a lot more sense.
[937.00 → 938.00] Because I've been trying to figure out like, what book would this be in?
[938.00 → 939.00] Yeah.
[939.00 → 940.00] That makes way more sense.
[940.00 → 941.00] Yeah.
[941.00 → 942.00] Okay.
[942.00 → 945.00] So it's actually, like, they're, they're perfect and there's such a variety from, from short story to short story.
[945.00 → 946.00] Because he's, he's in Rogue One.
[946.00 → 947.00] Thrawn?
[947.00 → 951.00] No, uh, the, the, the crazy doctor guy that-
[951.00 → 952.00] Oh yeah, what's his face?
[952.00 → 953.00] I don't remember his name.
[953.00 → 955.00] The guy who's, I have the death sentence on 12 systems.
[955.00 → 956.00] Yes.
[956.00 → 957.00] What do you mean on 12 systems?
[957.00 → 958.00] Yeah.
[958.00 → 963.00] Mac, PC, Linux, Xbox, PlayStation 4, what are you talking about?
[963.00 → 965.00] That has driven me crazy.
[965.00 → 971.00] Like, and that, that's the kind of stuff that I probably would have fixed in a special edition.
[971.00 → 972.00] Right.
[972.00 → 973.00] Right.
[973.00 → 974.00] But yeah.
[974.00 → 977.00] It makes one word and all of a sudden this sentence makes any sense.
[977.00 → 979.00] That dude is in Rogue One.
[979.00 → 980.00] It's like a weird cameo.
[980.00 → 981.00] Right.
[981.00 → 982.00] He like slides past the screen.
[982.00 → 983.00] Right, right, right.
[983.00 → 987.00] And there's been some controversy there because like, the town that they're in blows the hell up.
[987.00 → 989.00] So everyone's like, how did he make it?
[989.00 → 990.00] Or I guess, no, that's after.
[990.00 → 991.00] Yeah.
[991.00 → 993.00] So that's, it's, no, yeah.
[993.00 → 994.00] So he must've gone there.
[994.00 → 996.00] And then died.
[996.00 → 998.00] Well, he has the death sentence on 12 systems.
[998.00 → 1000.00] So, I guess that got taken care of.
[1000.00 → 1003.00] But, um, oh yeah.
[1003.00 → 1004.00] Oh yeah.
[1004.00 → 1005.00] So I, okay.
[1005.00 → 1006.00] Okay, okay, fine.
[1006.00 → 1007.00] We'll talk, we'll talk about this.
[1007.00 → 1009.00] Basically, Nvidia posted a blog post.
[1009.00 → 1013.00] Titan XP enables new levels of performance for creative professionals.
[1013.00 → 1017.00] Our latest driver available today delivers three times more performance in applications like Maya.
[1017.00 → 1020.00] So you can create and design faster than ever before.
[1020.00 → 1023.00] And when you're done, you can rip through Battlefield 1 at 100 frames per second.
[1023.00 → 1025.00] The best part is its available from Nvidia.com.
[1025.00 → 1026.00] Yeah, that is the best part.
[1026.00 → 1027.00] Yeah, not GeForce Experience.
[1027.00 → 1028.00] So.
[1028.00 → 1029.00] Although it's also available there.
[1029.00 → 1030.00] Here's why, okay.
[1030.00 → 1042.00] While I appreciate the gesture, this is why, um, no competition is a big loadable crap.
[1042.00 → 1062.00] Because Nvidia, to their credit, has actually done a reasonably good job with the technology available to them of iterating and driving graphics performance faster and faster and faster in basically the complete absence of any competitor over the last few years.
[1062.00 → 1063.00] When it comes to gaming.
[1063.00 → 1064.00] Yeah.
[1064.00 → 1069.00] Where they have cut back, and they have scaled back especially.
[1069.00 → 1071.00] And to be clear, I have my criticisms of Nvidia.
[1071.00 → 1081.00] The fact that we now get each generation of GPUs as two generations of GeForce's with the, the, the sec, the cut down card as a flagship.
[1081.00 → 1084.00] And then we get the real one as a next generation flagship.
[1084.00 → 1085.00] Yeah.
[1085.00 → 1086.00] Okay, so I've got my issues.
[1086.00 → 1088.00] Which is super frustrating.
[1088.00 → 1089.00] Which is frustrating.
[1089.00 → 1090.00] Clear.
[1090.00 → 1093.00] But I understand the business reasons why they're doing it.
[1093.00 → 1094.00] And it's not that bad.
[1094.00 → 1097.00] They are still developing new GPUs.
[1097.00 → 1101.00] Even if that development is driven by professional use and the data centre.
[1101.00 → 1103.00] Our title is LTX 2017.
[1103.00 → 1104.00] Oh, is it?
[1104.00 → 1105.00] And IRL.
[1105.00 → 1107.00] Can you fix or do you want me to fix?
[1107.00 → 1108.00] I can't.
[1108.00 → 1109.00] Unfortunately.
[1109.00 → 1110.00] Um.
[1110.00 → 1111.00] Okay.
[1111.00 → 1114.00] Uh, the WAN show.
[1114.00 → 1116.00] You just changed what category we're into.
[1116.00 → 1119.00] News and talk.
[1119.00 → 1123.00] Uh, Fridays at 3.30 Pacific.
[1123.00 → 1124.00] Is.
[1124.00 → 1125.00] Yeah, that's okay.
[1125.00 → 1126.00] I'll just leave it.
[1126.00 → 1127.00] And the category?
[1127.00 → 1128.00] Talk shows.
[1128.00 → 1129.00] Talk shows.
[1129.00 → 1130.00] Talk shows.
[1130.00 → 1131.00] There you go.
[1131.00 → 1132.00] Uppity bop pity done.
[1132.00 → 1133.00] Thank you viewer.
[1133.00 → 1134.00] Okay.
[1134.00 → 1135.00] All right.
[1135.00 → 1136.00] Remember the first Titan?
[1136.00 → 1137.00] Yeah.
[1137.00 → 1142.00] Was actually suitable for workstation use.
[1142.00 → 1143.00] Yeah.
[1143.00 → 1152.00] So, it was actually capable of less cut down FP64 performance compared to the gaming cards.
[1152.00 → 1155.00] It was more like a Squadron in that sense.
[1155.00 → 1163.00] Since then, not only Titans, but also Squadron have not had the same functionality enabled compared
[1163.00 → 1164.00] to their Tesla counterparts.
[1164.00 → 1165.00] Yeah.
[1165.00 → 1171.00] And then in the case of the very high-end Tesla GP100, that one has excellent high precision
[1171.00 → 1172.00] performance as well.
[1172.00 → 1180.00] So, this is basically NVIDIA like re-unlocking something that they locked away because they
[1180.00 → 1182.00] didn't have to deal with it.
[1182.00 → 1184.00] Which is frustrating.
[1184.00 → 1185.00] Frustrating.
[1185.00 → 1189.00] But also, I'm glad that we have it.
[1189.00 → 1190.00] Like, I'm happy it happened.
[1190.00 → 1192.00] I'm sad that it had to happen.
[1192.00 → 1194.00] This looks like a blatant response to Vega.
[1194.00 → 1200.00] And the rumours around Vega are that regardless of gaming performance, it looks like it's
[1200.00 → 1203.00] going to be a pretty powerful professional platform.
[1203.00 → 1205.00] Which is like, weird.
[1205.00 → 1206.00] But cool.
[1206.00 → 1209.00] I can also see why they're doing it, you know?
[1209.00 → 1213.00] Like, we have a video coming soon about AMD's Vega-based supercomputer.
[1213.00 → 1216.00] So, it's one Peñaflor on a single rack.
[1216.00 → 1217.00] Whoa.
[1217.00 → 1221.00] And, I mean, that is...
[1221.00 → 1228.00] Between, like, between mining and, like, professional, like, research use, AMD could probably sell...
[1228.00 → 1229.00] Which is becoming more and more common.
[1229.00 → 1230.00] Mm-hmm.
[1230.00 → 1233.00] And they could probably sell every graphics card they could possibly make.
[1233.00 → 1235.00] That's great.
[1235.00 → 1236.00] Which is...
[1236.00 → 1237.00] Which is...
[1237.00 → 1238.00] Which is great!
[1238.00 → 1239.00] Um...
[1239.00 → 1240.00] Because they need to.
[1240.00 → 1241.00] Because they really do need to.
[1241.00 → 1242.00] Um...
[1242.00 → 1245.00] And I forget where I was going with that.
[1245.00 → 1246.00] Right.
[1246.00 → 1247.00] So, that's so...
[1247.00 → 1248.00] Right.
[1248.00 → 1249.00] So, it's not a huge surprise to me that that's driving their design.
[1249.00 → 1250.00] Yeah.
[1250.00 → 1251.00] It's just...
[1251.00 → 1253.00] It hasn't been very common.
[1253.00 → 1254.00] In...
[1254.00 → 1255.00] In those...
[1255.00 → 1256.00] Style of cards.
[1256.00 → 1257.00] Yes.
[1257.00 → 1258.00] All right.
[1258.00 → 1259.00] So, uh...
[1259.00 → 1260.00] Let's move...
[1260.00 → 1261.00] Let's do one more topic.
[1261.00 → 1262.00] Um...
[1262.00 → 1264.00] And then we'll just end the show early.
[1264.00 → 1265.00] No, I'm kidding.
[1265.00 → 1266.00] Then we'll do ads.
[1266.00 → 1271.00] So, AMD clarifies why Thread ripper is using four dies.
[1271.00 → 1274.00] So, this was posted by Niacin on the forum.
[1274.00 → 1275.00] Let's go ahead and pull this up.
[1275.00 → 1277.00] Because check that out.
[1277.00 → 1279.00] There's a delisted Thread ripper.
[1279.00 → 1280.00] This doesn't make any sense.
[1280.00 → 1283.00] Because Epic goes up to 32 cores.
[1283.00 → 1291.00] And also sits on a very similar package with four exposed dies like this if you were to debit it.
[1291.00 → 1295.00] So, why would Thread ripper also need four?
[1295.00 → 1300.00] Because it doesn't have an eight channel memory controller like Epic does.
[1300.00 → 1304.00] So, it wouldn't need the two memory controllers per die.
[1304.00 → 1311.00] And it turns out that what's going on here is because Thread ripper only goes up to 16 cores,
[1311.00 → 1315.00] what we're actually seeing is two fully enabled dies.
[1315.00 → 1318.00] And then two of them are just dummies.
[1318.00 → 1319.00] Right.
[1319.00 → 1320.00] Because they're diagonal.
[1320.00 → 1321.00] That's right.
[1321.00 → 1327.00] So, these are supposed to help spread out the heat load according to, uh, you know, what will give us more...
[1327.00 → 1330.00] better heat dissipation to our coolers.
[1330.00 → 1332.00] Well, more...yeah, evenly dissipate.
[1332.00 → 1336.00] So, instead of it being on that diagonal, it's kind of more around.
[1336.00 → 1337.00] Better for coolers.
[1337.00 → 1338.00] A lot better for coolers.
[1338.00 → 1342.00] And, uh, the other purpose of the two dies is actually structural.
[1342.00 → 1348.00] So, they prevent imbalance and allow for simple cooler mounting without any chance of damaging the CPU.
[1348.00 → 1349.00] They are not active.
[1349.00 → 1352.00] They're not, like, failed Ry zen cores or anything like that.
[1352.00 → 1354.00] They don't even contain working transistors.
[1354.00 → 1359.00] So, there's no hope of being able to, like, unlock them or something.
[1359.00 → 1360.00] They are just dummy cores.
[1360.00 → 1363.00] AMD also didn't want to create a new socket for Thread ripper.
[1363.00 → 1367.00] So, they, like, found some ways to take benefit from having these dummy core things.
[1367.00 → 1369.00] Then were like, cool, sounds good.
[1369.00 → 1373.00] Designing a socket is a fairly significant undertaking, um, aside from electrically.
[1373.00 → 1374.00] And it's really annoying.
[1374.00 → 1375.00] Yeah.
[1375.00 → 1376.00] Not, not for AMD.
[1376.00 → 1377.00] It's really annoying for everyone else.
[1377.00 → 1380.00] There's this whole new platform, new boards.
[1380.00 → 1381.00] New mounting holes.
[1381.00 → 1382.00] New mounting holes.
[1382.00 → 1383.00] Yep.
[1383.00 → 1384.00] You're not going to be able to transfer hardware as much.
[1384.00 → 1390.00] It's going to be harder to have stuff on hand if you're swapping stuff out in, like, a very high availability, mini-server type of situation.
[1390.00 → 1394.00] It's annoying for board partners who have to make more things now.
[1394.00 → 1397.00] It's annoying for everyone on the entire stack.
[1397.00 → 1398.00] Yep.
[1398.00 → 1400.00] And, you know, you look at something like USB Micro B.
[1400.00 → 1406.00] That should give you some idea how hard it is to design a robust, reliable interface.
[1406.00 → 1407.00] Yeah.
[1407.00 → 1411.00] And so, the fewer of those that AMD has to build, the better.
[1411.00 → 1412.00] Yep.
[1412.00 → 1413.00] Cool.
[1413.00 → 1414.00] All right.
[1414.00 → 1415.00] Oh, so, sponsors.
[1415.00 → 1416.00] Yeah.
[1416.00 → 1418.00] What do we get here?
[1418.00 → 1419.00] Sponsors!
[1419.00 → 1420.00] Oh, really?
[1420.00 → 1423.00] Cooler Master is one of our sponsors today.
[1423.00 → 1429.00] Cooler Master featuring keyboards covered in dust.
[1429.00 → 1435.00] Because our entire warehouse has been under construction for the last...
[1435.00 → 1436.00] Yeah, don't do that.
[1436.00 → 1437.00] Why would you do that?
[1437.00 → 1438.00] That was a bad idea.
[1438.00 → 1441.00] Oh, jeez.
[1441.00 → 1442.00] What is wrong with you?
[1442.00 → 1443.00] I'm sorry.
[1443.00 → 1452.00] So, the Cooler Master Keys Pro comes in different sizes with white lighting or RGB to suit your needs.
[1452.00 → 1454.00] While the Pro S comes in white and RGB.
[1454.00 → 1455.00] Oh, wow.
[1455.00 → 1461.00] Well, the Pro S white and the Pro M RGB are the newest additions to their lineup.
[1461.00 → 1465.00] They complete the Cooler Master Keyboard profile or portfolio.
[1465.00 → 1466.00] Wow, I'm terrible at this.
[1466.00 → 1467.00] You got it.
[1467.00 → 1468.00] Whatever.
[1468.00 → 1469.00] Cooler Master makes perfect mechanical keyboards.
[1469.00 → 1470.00] They're great for typing.
[1470.00 → 1471.00] They're great for gaming.
[1471.00 → 1473.00] I have basically no complaints.
[1473.00 → 1477.00] They've got bright LED lighting, including the availability of RGB.
[1477.00 → 1479.00] Minimalistic kind of design.
[1479.00 → 1485.00] And the interior has been completely redesigned to fit Cherry MX switches as well as LEDs.
[1485.00 → 1489.00] The Master Keys Pro white M and L have white LED backlighting.
[1489.00 → 1495.00] And if you're more into a brighter, clear white backlight versus just changing your RGB one to white.
[1495.00 → 1497.00] Which doesn't look quite as satisfying.
[1497.00 → 1498.00] Yeah.
[1498.00 → 1504.00] They've got a bunch of different LED lighting modes, macro recording, and four profile keys with easy to use software.
[1504.00 → 1506.00] Basically, they're good stuff.
[1506.00 → 1510.00] You can check them out at the link below right about.
[1510.00 → 1514.00] CoolerMaster.com slash product slash line slash keyboards.
[1514.00 → 1517.00] Wow, we really need a vanity URL for that.
[1517.00 → 1518.00] Yeah.
[1518.00 → 1519.00] Oh, cool.
[1519.00 → 1521.00] Yeah, this one's got a detachable keyboard as well.
[1521.00 → 1522.00] Or a detachable.
[1522.00 → 1523.00] Detachable keyboard.
[1523.00 → 1524.00] Detachable cable as well.
[1524.00 → 1525.00] Nice.
[1525.00 → 1526.00] Yeah.
[1526.00 → 1527.00] Which is really nice.
[1527.00 → 1528.00] Not usually.
[1528.00 → 1529.00] Usually it doesn't matter at all.
[1529.00 → 1531.00] But if you're packing up your keyboard to take it somewhere,
[1531.00 → 1535.00] where there's actually a risk of damaging the connector in your bag or whatever,
[1535.00 → 1536.00] it's nice to be able to take it.
[1536.00 → 1538.00] Which I have had to do recently.
[1538.00 → 1540.00] And it is actually quite nice.
[1540.00 → 1541.00] Yeah.
[1541.00 → 1544.00] Next up, we've got Squarespace.
[1544.00 → 1545.00] Squarespace.
[1545.00 → 1547.00] Squarespace!
[1547.00 → 1553.00] Squarespace is the place to go if you want to create your own place to go.
[1553.00 → 1554.00] Yeah.
[1554.00 → 1556.00] With Squarespace, you can take any one of their gorgeous templates,
[1556.00 → 1559.00] and they've got a lot of them now, actually.
[1559.00 → 1560.00] That would be legit.
[1560.00 → 1561.00] Okay.
[1561.00 → 1562.00] I'm just going to cut you off here for a second.
[1562.00 → 1563.00] I'll let you continue.
[1563.00 → 1564.00] I'm going to let you finish, but.
[1564.00 → 1566.00] They should take that as a slogan.
[1566.00 → 1571.00] The place to go if you want to make your own place to go.
[1571.00 → 1574.00] It sounds kind of like Home Depot.
[1574.00 → 1576.00] Sort of.
[1576.00 → 1577.00] But Squarespace, is it not?
[1577.00 → 1578.00] It's kind of like the Home Depot for websites.
[1578.00 → 1579.00] Like a Home Depot for websites?
[1579.00 → 1580.00] Yeah.
[1580.00 → 1582.00] I don't know if I'm allowed to say that.
[1582.00 → 1583.00] No.
[1583.00 → 1584.00] Whatever.
[1584.00 → 1586.00] Anyway, you pick one of their gorgeous templates,
[1586.00 → 1589.00] and just for 12 bucks a month, starting at 12 bucks a month,
[1589.00 → 1591.00] and you get a free domain, if you buy it for the year,
[1591.00 → 1594.00] you just basically go, okay, I want pictures here, text here,
[1594.00 → 1595.00] add a menu there.
[1595.00 → 1596.00] It's all cloud-based.
[1596.00 → 1601.00] It is super reliable, and your site will look great and beautiful on any device,
[1601.00 → 1606.00] whether it's a laptop, desktop, or mobile phone.
[1606.00 → 1609.00] I've even seen them on smartwatches before.
[1609.00 → 1610.00] Really?
[1610.00 → 1611.00] Yeah.
[1611.00 → 1613.00] That can't be that great.
[1613.00 → 1616.00] I mean, it was a website on a smartwatch, so it wasn't that great,
[1616.00 → 1619.00] but for a website, it did pretty good.
[1619.00 → 1624.00] Every site includes a free online store with their commerce module,
[1624.00 → 1627.00] they've got their logo designer, they've got cover pages,
[1627.00 → 1630.00] which lets you set up a one-page presence in just minutes,
[1630.00 → 1633.00] and you can start a credit card-free trial.
[1633.00 → 1634.00] See, I've recovered that there.
[1634.00 → 1637.00] You can start a trial with no credit card required over at
[1637.00 → 1639.00] wherespace.com slash when.
[1639.00 → 1642.00] Then when you sign up, don't forget to use our offer code.
[1642.00 → 1646.00] Use offer code WHEN, and you'll save 10%.
[1646.00 → 1651.00] Leading us to our last sponsor, Savage Jerky.
[1651.00 → 1652.00] Which, which, uh, MADE?
[1652.00 → 1655.00] I ate all the mojo after the show last week, so I have no mojo.
[1655.00 → 1657.00] Do you know STR MADE? You know STR MADE, right?
[1657.00 → 1658.00] Yeah, I know MADE.
[1658.00 → 1660.00] So MADE bought a bunch of these.
[1660.00 → 1661.00] Yeah.
[1661.00 → 1662.00] Even though he's from New Zealand.
[1662.00 → 1668.00] And ended up spending, like, just about as much on shipping as he did for the jerky.
[1668.00 → 1669.00] So...
[1669.00 → 1670.00] He's a crazy guy, man.
[1670.00 → 1671.00] We'll see what he thinks of it.
[1671.00 → 1676.00] And he has a crazy spice tolerance, so he's going to try some of the like, really, really spicy things.
[1676.00 → 1678.00] What kind of punishment do you want today?
[1678.00 → 1683.00] Because, honestly, most of the, uh, most of the pretty tame stuff has been eaten.
[1683.00 → 1684.00] Oh.
[1684.00 → 1686.00] We do have some traditional.
[1686.00 → 1687.00] You want some traditional?
[1687.00 → 1689.00] You can go with traditional, I'll take it this time.
[1689.00 → 1690.00] Yes!
[1690.00 → 1691.00] I'm going for the...
[1691.00 → 1692.00] What?
[1692.00 → 1693.00] Oh, mojo habanero?
[1693.00 → 1694.00] Yeah.
[1694.00 → 1696.00] Oh, is that like the regular mojo?
[1696.00 → 1697.00] Okay, no, I'll take the hot one.
[1697.00 → 1698.00] Okay.
[1698.00 → 1699.00] I want to try this one.
[1699.00 → 1701.00] Mojo habanero is the one where it's like...
[1701.00 → 1702.00] I hear you pick whatever you want.
[1702.00 → 1708.00] Right in the spice profile for me where it's good if I just don't go way too fast.
[1708.00 → 1709.00] So three levels.
[1709.00 → 1710.00] Or three bars.
[1710.00 → 1711.00] Three bars of spice.
[1711.00 → 1712.00] Okay, I want to try this one.
[1712.00 → 1714.00] Um, so savage jerky.
[1714.00 → 1716.00] The jerky's made with the best ingredients.
[1716.00 → 1717.00] The best.
[1717.00 → 1719.00] Without nitrates or preservatives.
[1719.00 → 1721.00] The goal was to create a snack that's full of flavour.
[1721.00 → 1723.00] They definitely achieved that.
[1723.00 → 1724.00] But this isn't bad for you.
[1724.00 → 1725.00] I'll go with ghost pepper.
[1725.00 → 1730.00] Um, we've got notes here about what people seem to love.
[1730.00 → 1732.00] I like the maple buffalo bacon.
[1732.00 → 1733.00] And I think mojo's my new favourite.
[1733.00 → 1734.00] Mojo's perfect.
[1734.00 → 1735.00] Mojo and traditional are both perfect.
[1735.00 → 1736.00] Mm-hmm.
[1736.00 → 1737.00] And I think they're new flavours, aren't they?
[1737.00 → 1738.00] But if you like spicy, there's like ghost pepper and like Carolina Reaper and like all that
[1738.00 → 1739.00] kinds of crazy stuff.
[1739.00 → 1740.00] I'm going to try the same thing and this is my first one.
[1740.00 → 1741.00] Yeah, definitely compliment my promote.
[1741.00 → 1742.00] Even though I got a problem.
[1742.00 → 1743.00] To book it down to go.
[1743.00 → 1744.00] That's rich is about three or four Warlloricanes Wow.
[1744.00 → 1745.00] Uh-huh.
[1745.00 → 1746.00] Absolutely.
[1746.00 → 1747.00] Thank you so much.
[1747.00 → 1750.00] The town that I've already enjoyed with here is away PLE displaying the best that
[1750.00 → 1751.00] has featured in it.
[1751.00 → 1753.00] Okay, Seine majesty.
[1753.00 → 1754.00] And so I language my moustache.
[1754.00 → 1755.00] Aqua!
[1755.00 → 1756.00] I see fundamentally provide, starting by recognizing their favorite집ations,
[1756.00 → 1758.00] Ghosts, like growing up and growing up by boosting ап sera please,
[1758.00 → 1759.00] and the astrologer is better than you have to be.
[1759.00 → 1762.00] Not one more than a variety of exceptionals laughs and those 맛있어요 songs.
[1763.00 → 1765.00] They guys generally are great for you.
[1765.00 → 1766.00] And there's investor power from a variety of fest doing,
[1766.00 → 1770.38] And now I'll be eating this for the rest of the show.
[1771.74 → 1772.68] Sorry in advance, everyone.
[1773.02 → 1774.00] Which one did you have today?
[1774.22 → 1774.64] Ghost pepper.
[1775.28 → 1776.80] Oh, the ghost pepper is brutal.
[1777.34 → 1778.20] Yeah, it's all right.
[1781.64 → 1782.00] Yeah.
[1783.48 → 1784.16] Everything's fine.
[1784.30 → 1784.98] This one's really nice.
[1785.12 → 1785.38] Flow plane?
[1786.32 → 1787.36] Oh, yeah, what do we have?
[1787.50 → 1788.00] Oh, you know what?
[1788.04 → 1788.86] No, I don't have it ready yet.
[1789.12 → 1789.80] Let me get it ready first.
[1789.80 → 1790.14] That's cool.
[1791.12 → 1793.62] First up, we've got a leak.
[1794.54 → 1795.22] That's right.
[1795.22 → 1797.46] Leaks has left the building.
[1798.08 → 1798.86] Entered the building.
[1799.76 → 1802.30] This was posted by Mr. Troll over on the forum,
[1802.40 → 1804.74] and the original article here is from Tweak Town.
[1807.30 → 1810.44] AMD Radeon RX Vega 56.
[1811.54 → 1812.80] Benchmarks have been leaked,
[1813.02 → 1815.10] and it looks like, according to the leak,
[1815.48 → 1819.06] it may prove to be a GTX 1070 killer.
[1819.90 → 1821.24] Which would be good for them.
[1821.68 → 1823.98] Because the 1070 is a very nice card.
[1825.22 → 1828.78] Is it a little bit too hot?
[1830.04 → 1832.06] Yeah, but I'll get adjusted.
[1832.26 → 1834.58] I find that one, like, if you take it slow, is perfect.
[1834.62 → 1835.56] Yeah, I'm going to have some more after.
[1836.84 → 1840.50] So, Battlefield 1 has it beating the GTX 1070.
[1841.50 → 1842.60] Civ 6, same thing.
[1842.86 → 1844.26] Doom, apparently, same thing.
[1844.26 → 1848.02] And COD, whatever, is that Infinite Warfare?
[1848.22 → 1848.44] Okay.
[1848.50 → 1850.00] I don't know why they're benchmarking that, but sure.
[1850.20 → 1850.52] Sure.
[1850.66 → 1850.90] Okay.
[1851.08 → 1860.36] Anyway, it looks like, it actually looks like anywhere from 10 to even as much as almost 15% faster in some of those benchmarks.
[1860.36 → 1868.08] So, that would be great news for Team Red, although I don't know how much stake or stock to put in this.
[1868.18 → 1868.96] And do we know the price?
[1870.18 → 1870.82] $399.
[1872.18 → 1873.68] It is rumoured to be $399.
[1873.88 → 1877.40] In fact, we have all the rumours for Vega pricing, and we will go through those in a minute.
[1878.40 → 1880.82] And okay, how much is a 1070 right now?
[1880.82 → 1881.22] Let's see.
[1882.56 → 1883.12] GTX 1070.
[1883.12 → 1883.34] More.
[1883.46 → 1883.92] About 450.
[1884.70 → 1884.98] 450.
[1885.32 → 1885.56] Yeah.
[1887.66 → 1890.16] So, the benchmarks were run at 1440p.
[1890.50 → 1891.64] Battlefield 1 at Ultra.
[1891.96 → 1895.48] Civ 6 at Ultra with 4x multi-sample antialiasing.
[1896.10 → 1899.20] Doom at Ultra with TSAR.
[1899.76 → 1901.96] And it is rumoured to be coming in at $399.
[1902.92 → 1903.32] Now.
[1903.52 → 1910.62] So, yeah, you can get 450, usually closer to like 470, 480, and some at $499.
[1911.68 → 1913.64] That will be pretty killer.
[1914.20 → 1917.76] We don't have a rumoured release date, though, for that, I don't think.
[1918.38 → 1921.18] So, we'll have to wait and see when it actually shows up.
[1921.26 → 1921.40] Right.
[1922.34 → 1926.34] Other prices, though, we do have as well.
[1926.46 → 1929.00] So, this was posted by Buck GOP on the forum.
[1932.86 → 1939.44] And this slide here, leaked by WCCF Tech, says that it will be available August 2017,
[1939.44 → 1941.84] and there will be a Vega 64.
[1943.02 → 1945.02] A Vega 64 limited edition.
[1945.24 → 1945.94] This we knew about.
[1946.04 → 1948.16] This we talked about when we did our unveiling at LTX.
[1948.22 → 1949.54] So, that's with a brushed metal shroud.
[1949.88 → 1952.48] And there will be a Vega 64 liquid cooled.
[1954.44 → 1955.48] What else we got here?
[1955.52 → 1959.80] Is that just a lighter coloured brushed metal shroud on the liquid cooled?
[1959.86 → 1960.66] It looks like it.
[1960.78 → 1961.78] It may not even be lighter.
[1962.38 → 1962.70] Right.
[1962.70 → 1964.34] I don't know why they went so light.
[1964.34 → 1967.06] Nobody does silver right now.
[1968.96 → 1969.52] Yeah.
[1969.98 → 1972.92] It's like they want the reference card to clash with everything.
[1975.10 → 1975.66] Okay.
[1976.72 → 1978.34] So, here's the rumoured pricing.
[1979.24 → 1986.92] The Radeon Aqua Pack, which is supposed to include the liquid card with what?
[1986.92 → 1989.22] Probably with the rest of the equipment you need to run it, I'm assuming.
[1989.22 → 1990.78] I have to see what's rumoured.
[1993.10 → 1994.44] No, BA-da-ba-ba.
[1995.26 → 1996.26] Vega Vega Vega.
[1996.74 → 1997.66] Vega Vega Vega.
[1998.14 → 1999.26] Specs, specs, specs.
[1999.34 → 2000.24] Reference model.
[2000.52 → 2007.62] Starts at $4.99 apparently for the 64 limited edition 295 watt card.
[2008.20 → 2008.68] Wow.
[2009.06 → 2011.38] Wow, you guys.
[2011.38 → 2015.16] I do want to say, if you can scroll down for a second.
[2015.54 → 2019.56] Whoa, the liquid cooled one is apparently going to be 350 watt.
[2021.38 → 2022.56] Wow, AMD.
[2023.94 → 2025.94] What are you doing over there, buddy?
[2028.32 → 2029.06] Okay, sorry.
[2029.12 → 2029.76] What were you pointing at?
[2030.40 → 2034.98] Just the fact that this is just like a thing that's average now.
[2035.04 → 2037.14] 12.7 teraflops.
[2037.30 → 2037.78] Yeah, that's crazy.
[2037.78 → 2042.30] Like, I still remember when we, like, just barely passed one and everyone was like, holy crap.
[2042.38 → 2044.20] Wow, a teraflop on a GPU.
[2044.68 → 2045.78] Holy smokes.
[2046.32 → 2046.78] Um.
[2047.82 → 2049.46] So what else we got here for rumours?
[2050.42 → 2055.90] So, the bundles will apparently include discounts on select Ry zen CPU and motherboard combos.
[2056.16 → 2056.60] That's cool.
[2056.60 → 2061.44] Select Samsung Free Sync displays and two game titles, Wolfenstein 2 and Prey 2.
[2061.60 → 2062.34] That's really cool.
[2062.90 → 2063.30] Um.
[2063.30 → 2067.04] The game part is actually surprisingly less cool than the other ones.
[2067.16 → 2072.70] But would you pay an extra however much for a bundle?
[2074.48 → 2074.84] Oh, wait.
[2074.90 → 2075.04] No.
[2075.16 → 2075.64] This is, okay.
[2075.74 → 2075.88] Right.
[2075.98 → 2077.16] But the packs aren't rumoured.
[2077.26 → 2077.42] Right.
[2077.52 → 2079.12] I've already made a video about that.
[2079.18 → 2079.28] Okay.
[2079.28 → 2081.86] I can never tell what I'm supposed to know and not supposed to know.
[2082.22 → 2083.28] So, I do know that.
[2083.34 → 2083.48] Okay.
[2083.54 → 2084.18] But tell me this.
[2084.22 → 2085.36] So, what's your thought process on it then?
[2085.58 → 2086.04] Because it looks.
[2086.04 → 2086.68] This is the first time I've heard.
[2086.68 → 2091.46] It looks like the pack adds about $100 to the card versus if you were able to just buy it standalone.
[2091.96 → 2093.60] But then what's the discounts on the other stuff?
[2094.38 → 2094.76] The disc.
[2094.82 → 2098.84] You pay an extra $100, and you get a discount on other stuff.
[2098.92 → 2099.80] But what's the discount?
[2100.04 → 2101.38] Because if I'm going to buy that stuff anyway.
[2101.38 → 2101.44] Oh.
[2101.44 → 2103.88] You get $100 off of Ry zen CPU and motherboard combo.
[2104.26 → 2104.54] Okay.
[2104.72 → 2106.80] You get up to $200 off of Free Sync display.
[2106.80 → 2109.98] So, if I was going to buy a monitor and that CPU and motherboard anyway.
[2110.04 → 2110.78] Then you're thrilled.
[2111.08 → 2111.30] Yeah.
[2111.66 → 2112.28] But were you?
[2113.22 → 2114.38] As an enthusiast.
[2114.40 → 2115.16] I don't know.
[2115.16 → 2120.20] Because the 64 version is only going to be available at launch with bundles.
[2120.90 → 2121.42] Oh, really?
[2124.40 → 2124.92] Okay.
[2124.98 → 2126.56] How does this bundle thing work?
[2126.94 → 2128.28] Or packs or whatever?
[2128.40 → 2129.88] Like, what are you actually buying when you buy the pack?
[2129.92 → 2132.30] You just pay $100 extra, and you get discount cards?
[2132.54 → 2132.78] Yes.
[2133.20 → 2133.54] What?
[2134.28 → 2135.72] You just get like little paper discount cards.
[2135.72 → 2138.24] He went from thinking it's a great idea to being super mad.
[2138.36 → 2139.14] Like that.
[2139.20 → 2139.62] It's amazing.
[2139.82 → 2141.56] You just get like little paper discount cards.
[2142.44 → 2144.14] Or like in an email or something.
[2144.14 → 2144.52] Or like digital.
[2145.16 → 2145.38] Yeah.
[2146.98 → 2151.92] And presumably, based on how promos like this typically worked at the retailer I used to
[2151.92 → 2154.24] work at, you'd probably have to use it like right away.
[2157.10 → 2157.46] Okay.
[2157.46 → 2160.30] So now what do you think?
[2160.42 → 2161.52] That's just weird.
[2162.02 → 2162.88] So the rationale.
[2162.88 → 2166.00] As a consumer, I would just wait until I don't have to do that anymore.
[2166.18 → 2166.42] Okay.
[2166.48 → 2167.64] Can I explain the rationale though?
[2167.82 → 2171.00] Unless for some reason I did want to buy that specific combination.
[2171.14 → 2171.94] Which might happen.
[2171.94 → 2175.34] Like someone who's just now getting into PC gaming.
[2175.34 → 2176.70] I could totally see that as a thing.
[2177.22 → 2177.54] Okay.
[2177.66 → 2182.46] So the rationale is that they don't want coin miners to just snap them all up.
[2182.46 → 2199.38] And if I had to guess, I would say that this is AMD's way of punishing coin miners, just charging them more, since the value, like the used secondhand value of the cards will be higher than the freaking retail price.
[2199.50 → 2200.94] AMD might as well take that money.
[2200.94 → 2205.90] And those people won't care about monitors or games or CPU motherboard bundles.
[2206.70 → 2214.46] And so it's their way of punishing miners and giving an even better deal to anyone building a new PC.
[2214.84 → 2215.86] Isn't that crashing though?
[2216.72 → 2217.18] Crashing?
[2217.66 → 2219.64] Like miners aren't buying as many cards right now.
[2220.04 → 2221.96] That's, I'm not sure.
[2222.10 → 2224.94] To be perfectly honest with you, I don't know where the whole mining scene is at.
[2226.12 → 2226.60] What?
[2226.82 → 2227.26] It's on the up.
[2227.56 → 2228.54] It's on the up again?
[2228.94 → 2229.56] Is it again?
[2229.56 → 2229.66] Again?
[2229.94 → 2230.06] Yeah.
[2230.94 → 2231.28] All right.
[2231.38 → 2232.60] Well, apparently mining is back.
[2232.88 → 2234.04] So that's the rationale.
[2234.04 → 2235.34] So it went away for like a week or two?
[2236.60 → 2239.90] And the new cards are really, perfect.
[2240.84 → 2241.24] Okay.
[2242.12 → 2244.86] So now that you know that, now what do you think?
[2247.42 → 2248.44] It's just weird.
[2249.20 → 2259.10] As someone who's buying a new computer, I would look at that and be like, especially someone who's not into mining and has no idea what it is, I would look at this setup and just be like, what?
[2259.10 → 2262.00] What the hell is going on?
[2262.00 → 2263.88] What the hell is going on?
[2263.88 → 2267.44] And that's like the majority of the people that are going to be looking at this, just to be completely honest.
[2267.44 → 2267.74] Right.
[2267.74 → 2270.12] The majority of the people that are looking at this are going to go, mining?
[2270.12 → 2272.06] What?
[2272.06 → 2272.08] What?
[2272.66 → 2274.56] Or like, I heard my friend talking about that.
[2274.60 → 2275.16] Why do I care?
[2275.20 → 2275.90] I just want to buy a graphics card.
[2275.90 → 2278.72] See, I just don't get it because like, my kids don't have graphics cards.
[2279.54 → 2281.78] So why do miners need all these graphics cards?
[2282.06 → 2282.48] Wow.
[2284.16 → 2284.56] Wow.
[2284.56 → 2287.80] That's like pretty high up there for bad.
[2287.94 → 2290.40] In other news, tape storage.
[2290.80 → 2291.20] Yeah.
[2291.40 → 2293.80] The media that just keeps on ticking.
[2294.78 → 2295.42] Heck yeah.
[2295.52 → 2298.70] This was posted on the forum by WE Groom AK.
[2298.98 → 2301.76] The original article here is from Ars Technica.
[2301.76 → 2309.44] IBM and Sony have figured out how to cram 330 terabytes into a tiny tape cartridge.
[2310.22 → 2318.80] Sputtered magnetic layer, lubricant, and new heads enable 200 gigabits per second, excuse me, per inch density.
[2319.18 → 2319.88] Yeah, per second.
[2319.96 → 2320.98] I was like, whoa, man.
[2321.08 → 2323.36] Yeah, that'd be some fast tape, yo.
[2323.36 → 2330.40] So this is, yeah, so this would be 330 terabytes in a palm-sized cartridge.
[2330.96 → 2335.88] The world's largest hard drives, by contrast, which are about twice the physical size of the tape,
[2336.32 → 2342.66] are the 60 terabyte Seagate SSD or 12 terabytes Hitachi helium-filled hard drive.
[2344.00 → 2344.68] Pretty cool.
[2345.64 → 2349.00] The largest commercially available tapes only store about 15 terabytes.
[2349.00 → 2355.18] So, when it's eventually commercialized, these new cartridges will be significantly more expensive
[2355.18 → 2357.80] because of the tape's complex manufacturing process.
[2358.26 → 2360.32] Likewise, a new tape drive will be required.
[2360.58 → 2364.38] But we'd only need, like, two to back up our entire petabyte project.
[2364.66 → 2364.88] Yeah.
[2365.42 → 2366.14] That's pretty cool.
[2366.14 → 2366.44] Because there's some redundancy.
[2366.56 → 2369.40] It's not actually a petabyte of addressable space.
[2369.52 → 2369.66] Yeah.
[2370.38 → 2371.02] All right.
[2371.12 → 2372.24] This is kind of a bummer.
[2372.40 → 2374.86] This is posted by Morgan Magma.
[2375.90 → 2376.74] Coffee Lake.
[2376.74 → 2382.94] So that's Intel's upcoming, rumoured to be up to six core mainstream processors,
[2383.38 → 2387.78] will apparently not, not work.
[2389.04 → 2390.52] Mute, mute, mute, mute, mute.
[2391.66 → 2393.78] Will not work with...
[2393.78 → 2394.52] Z270!
[2395.10 → 2395.40] Yeah.
[2396.98 → 2398.56] Dun, dun, dun.
[2398.56 → 2404.84] Mind you, this shouldn't be a surprise to anyone who's been following Intel's processor
[2404.84 → 2407.68] motherboard cadence over the last few years.
[2408.48 → 2412.20] Because Z170 and Z270, same socket.
[2413.16 → 2413.42] Okay?
[2413.52 → 2417.28] The chips that work in either work in both as long as there's BIOS compatibility.
[2417.52 → 2418.16] It's usually two gens.
[2418.20 → 2420.10] And it's usually two gens on the mainstream.
[2420.62 → 2421.02] So...
[2421.02 → 2426.14] And there was probably a significant reworking that was required in order to put a six core
[2426.14 → 2426.86] on the mainstream.
[2426.86 → 2433.44] It is interesting, though, that right now, it's not possible for people during the biggest
[2433.44 → 2441.12] war Intel has had in a while, because they haven't had a war in a while, that both sides
[2441.12 → 2442.98] would have to upgrade their whole platform.
[2443.42 → 2443.82] Hmm.
[2443.82 → 2450.34] Because right now, if this happened a year ago, you wouldn't have had to upgrade your
[2450.34 → 2450.82] platform.
[2450.98 → 2451.18] Right.
[2451.28 → 2453.14] Intel fans would have been able to...
[2453.14 → 2453.80] Buy the new chip.
[2453.82 → 2454.84] Just buy the new six cores.
[2454.92 → 2456.08] And that would have been the excuse.
[2456.28 → 2459.72] I don't want to move to the other side, because I'm just going to buy a chip, not a whole chip
[2459.72 → 2460.52] and motherboard combo.
[2460.60 → 2461.70] It's going to be way cheaper for me.
[2461.90 → 2464.70] There's no way it's financially viable for me to invest in a whole platform.
[2464.70 → 2466.88] Now it's whole platform versus whole platform.
[2467.92 → 2468.24] Hmm.
[2468.68 → 2469.52] So...
[2469.52 → 2474.80] Normal cadence or not, I think it helps AMD a lot that that's happening.
[2475.30 → 2476.20] Rumour, though...
[2476.20 → 2477.72] This won't help AMD if it's true.
[2477.72 → 2480.52] By friendly, non-murdering sort on the forum.
[2482.24 → 2483.24] That's kind of a...
[2483.24 → 2484.58] That's kind of a cool name.
[2484.92 → 2487.34] The original article here is from Guru3D.
[2487.48 → 2494.70] There's a rumoured Core i3 8300 with four cores and eight threads.
[2496.48 → 2501.24] Which would make it basically equivalent to, like, a 6700K, because it's apparently clocked
[2501.24 → 2502.04] at, like, 4 gigahertz.
[2502.96 → 2507.26] I don't know if this is just someone messing around with, like, Windows registry nonsense to
[2507.26 → 2510.86] get this to show up, but it doesn't look like it.
[2511.38 → 2513.54] Because there are also...
[2513.54 → 2514.54] Um...
[2514.54 → 2516.06] Here, what's...
[2516.06 → 2516.44] Oh, wait.
[2516.52 → 2516.88] No, yeah.
[2516.98 → 2520.02] It's all Windows capture, so...
[2520.02 → 2523.72] I'm not aware, personally, of a way to do that, like, off the top of my head, but it seems
[2523.72 → 2524.08] like something that could be possible.
[2524.08 → 2527.10] I mean, you could photo edit it, like, disgustingly easily.
[2527.36 → 2530.00] But, yeah, this is according to screenshots on a Chinese forum.
[2530.20 → 2534.84] I find this very hard to believe, and I would think it's more likely for it to be some
[2534.84 → 2535.66] weird...
[2535.66 → 2536.84] Apparently, yes, it's fake.
[2537.26 → 2537.86] Yeah.
[2538.46 → 2538.74] Yeah.
[2539.22 → 2539.86] I, uh...
[2539.86 → 2541.50] It's, like, super low res, too.
[2541.50 → 2541.70] Yeah.
[2542.00 → 2542.68] It's pretty crap.
[2542.96 → 2543.96] Um, but there you go.
[2544.00 → 2544.44] There's a rumour.
[2545.56 → 2548.02] Uh, oh, we got featured on...
[2548.02 → 2548.66] Ars Technica.
[2548.82 → 2552.86] Ars Technica, which was pretty sick, so I just want to self-congratulate over that.
[2553.74 → 2554.92] Um, neat.
[2555.28 → 2557.56] And they wrote up a little, kind of, like, write-up thing.
[2557.68 → 2558.52] Essentially a summary.
[2558.74 → 2558.90] Yep.
[2559.02 → 2561.80] Jake thinks that we should have a written site to accompany our videos.
[2561.90 → 2562.46] I disagree.
[2563.00 → 2564.60] I think we went down that path.
[2564.60 → 2565.04] Yep.
[2565.08 → 2566.06] And then we're like, wow.
[2566.22 → 2567.94] Wow, this is hard, and there's no money in it.
[2568.06 → 2568.26] Yeah.
[2568.76 → 2576.58] Um, we discovered, fortunately, before we invested our whole livelihood in print, online, written
[2576.58 → 2577.36] websites.
[2577.62 → 2577.84] Yeah.
[2577.84 → 2579.20] That, that's a bad idea.
[2579.52 → 2579.68] Yeah.
[2579.86 → 2581.90] Um, what else we got?
[2582.02 → 2582.26] Okay.
[2582.90 → 2583.94] I'm gonna...
[2583.94 → 2584.18] I'm...
[2584.18 → 2585.80] Yeah, I got one more topic for you.
[2586.18 → 2586.50] Okay.
[2586.54 → 2586.74] Okay.
[2586.84 → 2587.90] So let me pitch it to you.
[2587.90 → 2588.12] Is this your thing?
[2588.20 → 2589.38] Let me pitch it to you while...
[2589.38 → 2590.02] This is your thing?
[2590.04 → 2590.48] Well, okay.
[2590.50 → 2593.56] Let me pitch it to you while I, um, while I go through the float plane stuff.
[2593.60 → 2594.22] You can think about it.
[2594.84 → 2595.14] Okay?
[2595.30 → 2598.62] So this is a new segment that I'm gonna call What's Worse.
[2601.10 → 2601.62] So...
[2601.62 → 2602.82] People, I know.
[2602.92 → 2603.58] I've already read it.
[2603.68 → 2604.02] I know my answer.
[2604.02 → 2605.22] I know, but I have to...
[2605.22 → 2606.40] Hold on.
[2606.44 → 2606.68] Hold on.
[2606.68 → 2607.04] Okay.
[2607.72 → 2609.28] So, this kind of thing happens.
[2609.54 → 2610.46] Especially to some people.
[2611.08 → 2611.96] But what's worse?
[2612.50 → 2620.46] Dropping your phone in a public toilet that's empty, or in your own toilet after you peed
[2620.46 → 2620.76] in it.
[2624.08 → 2624.56] Okay.
[2624.70 → 2625.56] Now, hold on.
[2625.60 → 2630.06] In other news, we have some exclusive content over on float plane that you guys will want
[2630.06 → 2630.40] to watch.
[2630.54 → 2630.80] Yes.
[2631.28 → 2632.12] Tech Quickie.
[2632.22 → 2634.52] What's the difference between parallel and serial?
[2634.52 → 2639.58] The fastest ultra-wide gaming monitor, but at what cost?
[2640.52 → 2641.64] We can see thumbnails, too.
[2642.62 → 2642.92] Was.
[2643.22 → 2643.58] Wow.
[2643.66 → 2644.78] That is a cancerous thumbnail.
[2644.88 → 2645.34] Look at it go.
[2645.34 → 2648.26] There's exclusive content.
[2648.26 → 2649.80] Mezzanine update number 12.
[2649.88 → 2650.82] Almost there.
[2651.78 → 2652.32] Tech Quickie.
[2652.40 → 2655.62] Why are PC video game ports so bad?
[2656.32 → 2657.28] So bad.
[2657.38 → 2658.04] The worst.
[2658.80 → 2659.46] LTT.
[2659.70 → 2661.42] The brightest monitor we've ever seen.
[2661.62 → 2663.54] Dell's HDR display.
[2664.38 → 2667.44] AMD let me build their new 80 Vega supercomputer.
[2667.44 → 2669.76] Which they actually did.
[2670.66 → 2671.56] What else we got?
[2672.26 → 2673.42] More exclusive stuff.
[2673.50 → 2676.46] LTX behind the scenes vlog before the show opened.
[2677.12 → 2678.00] A lot of comments on that.
[2678.22 → 2678.36] That's cool.
[2679.16 → 2680.42] What else we got here?
[2681.42 → 2683.20] I think this one's live already.
[2683.28 → 2683.78] I'm not sure.
[2683.94 → 2684.44] July 28th.
[2684.44 → 2684.58] No.
[2684.72 → 2686.28] Why is hotel Wi-Fi so slow?
[2686.36 → 2687.32] That's a pretty good Tech Quickie.
[2687.32 → 2691.38] Pippin, Apple's only ever made console, is still not on YouTube.
[2691.52 → 2692.54] Yeah, that's still not on YouTube.
[2692.86 → 2696.14] So we did a reaction to Apple's forgotten game console.
[2696.22 → 2697.40] It's one of our longer videos.
[2697.86 → 2698.14] Mm-hmm.
[2698.70 → 2699.76] Yeah, actually, it's really long.
[2699.96 → 2701.16] It's 16 or 17 minutes long, I think.
[2701.16 → 2703.98] And it's one of the rare actually featuring Luke videos.
[2704.12 → 2704.32] Yeah.
[2705.32 → 2707.34] And I think there's one more that I'm missing.
[2707.46 → 2709.74] Because there's been a lot of simultaneous releases lately.
[2709.92 → 2714.08] Because all the Ry zen Thread ripper and all the Vega and all that kind of stuff.
[2715.24 → 2715.52] Yeah.
[2715.52 → 2720.14] I think what goes up, I think there's some good stuff going up this weekend.
[2720.28 → 2723.36] We're going to have our unboxing from LTX of the Razor Toaster.
[2724.06 → 2724.32] Okay.
[2724.42 → 2730.60] So if you guys aren't subscribed to Float plane already, then I'll go ahead and copy that link
[2730.60 → 2733.12] into the video description for you because it's pretty sick.
[2734.24 → 2739.38] Early access, better streaming video quality, and of course, it helps us keep this whole show
[2739.38 → 2740.14] going around here.
[2740.28 → 2742.12] So thank you in advance.
[2743.72 → 2744.14] Okay.
[2744.14 → 2744.20] Okay.
[2744.88 → 2745.26] So.
[2745.26 → 2748.90] So I don't think it's that simple of a question.
[2749.80 → 2750.10] Okay.
[2750.10 → 2750.14] Okay.
[2750.30 → 2751.68] So do you need some clarification?
[2752.30 → 2752.58] Yes.
[2752.64 → 2752.86] Okay.
[2752.86 → 2758.44] So the public toilet doesn't have any obvious, like, buildup in it.
[2759.40 → 2759.80] Okay.
[2759.92 → 2762.00] But it's a public toilet, and you weren't.
[2762.68 → 2764.32] What's, again, this is another thing, though.
[2764.36 → 2765.40] What's the water level?
[2765.86 → 2770.16] Because a lot of home toilets have a very high water level, and a lot of public toilets
[2770.16 → 2771.44] have a very low water level.
[2771.78 → 2772.92] The phone is submerged.
[2773.36 → 2773.62] Submerged?
[2773.62 → 2774.38] In either case.
[2774.44 → 2774.64] Yeah.
[2774.84 → 2775.64] The phone's submerged.
[2775.64 → 2779.22] You've got to put your, you've got to go, you've got to go above the wrist bone deep
[2779.22 → 2779.86] in either one.
[2782.86 → 2784.34] It's an interesting question.
[2784.34 → 2792.74] I think from, from reading the Twitch chat, it seems like most people, I could be totally
[2792.74 → 2797.04] wrong, but when I looked at it, it seemed like most people were saying, good, straw poll,
[2797.12 → 2797.46] good idea.
[2797.80 → 2800.42] It seemed like most people were saying public toilet.
[2800.42 → 2801.42] Really?
[2801.42 → 2801.98] Really?
[2802.22 → 2803.18] Because it's clean.
[2803.44 → 2805.06] But it might not be.
[2805.20 → 2806.86] I actually disagree, exactly.
[2807.96 → 2817.64] And my big thing for it is very narrow amount of sources of bacteria and other junk compared
[2817.64 → 2821.28] to extremely wide range amount of sources of other bacteria.
[2821.28 → 2821.76] Interesting.
[2822.00 → 2826.50] So you're going full science on your answer here, not just like, oh, I'm more comfortable
[2826.50 → 2834.64] with my own pee and my family's pee versus like a lot of my own pee versus trace amounts
[2834.64 → 2835.92] of somebody else's pee.
[2835.92 → 2839.24] And trace amounts of a huge mix of other people's stuff.
[2839.42 → 2839.60] Right.
[2839.62 → 2844.70] And more aggressive, more resilient bacteria might still be in there for sure.
[2845.18 → 2849.26] But that could also be true of your own toilet.
[2849.82 → 2850.22] Agreed.
[2851.32 → 2853.08] But it's still me.
[2853.18 → 2854.20] It's stuff that went through me.
[2854.28 → 2855.20] It's stuff that's around me.
[2855.24 → 2856.46] It's just going to go in my hand.
[2856.74 → 2856.94] Yeah.
[2857.14 → 2857.32] Yeah.
[2857.34 → 2858.30] It's probably okay.
[2858.70 → 2859.04] Okay.
[2859.38 → 2864.36] And I would do the trick where you flush it first, and then you grab it.
[2864.50 → 2867.16] And I would probably grab like a bunch of toilet paper and then grab it.
[2867.16 → 2867.88] Well, no, no.
[2867.94 → 2868.64] It probably wouldn't even touch my hand.
[2868.64 → 2871.00] For the sake of argument, you can't go get a rubber glove.
[2871.36 → 2872.58] Like, you have to...
[2872.58 → 2873.88] The toilet paper's literally right there.
[2873.90 → 2875.66] You don't have...
[2875.66 → 2877.04] Like, you don't have a waterproof phone.
[2877.26 → 2877.82] You have a Pixel.
[2878.20 → 2878.46] Okay?
[2878.82 → 2878.96] Yeah.
[2879.10 → 2880.96] You got to get in there and get it fast.
[2881.82 → 2882.08] Yeah.
[2882.94 → 2883.68] I'd probably flush it.
[2883.86 → 2885.14] Flushing happens really quickly.
[2885.14 → 2887.92] Yeah, but flushing also circulates the water.
[2888.04 → 2892.34] There's a worse chance of it penetrating a membrane or getting deeper into the phone.
[2892.34 → 2895.46] I mean, it's a Pixel, so it's screwed because they use cloth liners in their, like, speakers
[2895.46 → 2897.94] and stuff instead of metal, like most phones.
[2898.20 → 2898.84] Did you know about that?
[2899.34 → 2899.74] No, but that's...
[2899.74 → 2903.04] There's people that have, like, reached into here to try to clean out their, like, speaker
[2903.04 → 2904.12] grill thing and torn it.
[2904.54 → 2905.22] Oh, that's a shame.
[2907.32 → 2908.66] Yeah, it's kind of a mess.
[2908.86 → 2909.10] All right.
[2909.18 → 2910.04] Well, we've got the results.
[2910.16 → 2910.68] We've got the results.
[2910.70 → 2911.94] I'm really excited about the Pixel 2.
[2912.08 → 2912.88] Am I doing that review?
[2913.42 → 2914.02] I have no idea.
[2914.34 → 2914.78] I'm down.
[2917.62 → 2918.90] Most of you prefer...
[2918.90 → 2920.22] What if you flush your phone down?
[2922.14 → 2922.62] Whoa.
[2922.94 → 2923.76] No, you can't do that.
[2923.82 → 2924.86] How big is...
[2924.86 → 2928.32] Or how tiny is your phone?
[2930.52 → 2931.78] I'm very surprised.
[2932.46 → 2933.02] All right.
[2933.56 → 2933.80] Well...
[2934.46 → 2935.46] What do you think?
[2935.70 → 2936.58] It's your question.
[2940.80 → 2942.92] I'm going home toilet.
[2943.16 → 2943.28] Yeah.
[2943.28 → 2944.40] I'm going pee home toilet.
[2944.68 → 2945.14] Why, though?
[2945.14 → 2948.52] For me, it's a purely emotional thing.
[2948.58 → 2950.00] I don't have a scientific basis for it.
[2950.02 → 2950.80] You don't want to touch other people's stuff?
[2950.88 → 2951.42] I just...
[2951.42 → 2953.56] I find other people's stuff...
[2953.56 → 2955.64] So, remember, I'm coming at this as a parent.
[2956.80 → 2959.80] Part of my daily life is touching other people's pee and poo.
[2960.02 → 2960.20] Yeah.
[2960.20 → 2966.04] So, like, my comfort level with that over the last five years has gotten a lot higher.
[2966.20 → 2967.74] But, like, with your own crew.
[2967.80 → 2969.64] But that's, like, with my kids.
[2969.80 → 2970.04] Yeah.
[2970.34 → 2973.94] Whereas someone else, I'm just like, oh, man.
[2973.94 → 2975.28] That's...
[2975.28 → 2975.52] Yeah.
[2975.66 → 2979.20] And, like, I at least know what the cleaning schedule of my own toilets is.
[2979.28 → 2980.26] Whereas, like, someone else's...
[2980.26 → 2983.16] It could look clean, but, like...
[2983.16 → 2986.98] It might be clean just because, like, a lot of people have been going through there, and they take the stuff away.
[2987.46 → 2987.78] Yeah.
[2987.82 → 2988.60] Like, I don't know, man.
[2988.80 → 2990.16] So, that's where I'm at on that.
[2990.36 → 2991.10] That's where I'm at on that.
[2991.28 → 2991.50] Yeah.
[2992.08 → 2992.40] All right.
[2992.44 → 2994.30] Well, thank you guys very much for tuning in.
[2994.86 → 2996.18] We will see you again next week.
[2996.32 → 2997.32] Same bat time.
[2997.90 → 2998.04] Same...
[2998.04 → 2998.52] Actually, no.
[2998.52 → 3000.44] Oh, right.
[3000.84 → 3001.74] But on Friday.
[3002.30 → 3003.10] At the proper time.
[3003.36 → 3004.18] On the proper channel.
[3004.44 → 3005.50] This is the proper channel.
[3005.94 → 3006.18] Yeah.
[3006.38 → 3006.80] Okay, bye.
[3007.06 → 3007.36] Bye.
[3008.22 → 3008.52] Oh, right.
[3008.58 → 3008.92] The intro.
[3009.38 → 3009.68] Outro.
[3012.18 → 3013.82] Are you surprised by the results of that?
[3015.06 → 3015.88] A little, actually.
[3015.94 → 3018.26] I thought people would prefer not to put their hand in pee water.
[3018.26 → 3026.24] Someone said it's Friday.
[3026.40 → 3027.14] I guess maybe summer.
[3027.50 → 3029.08] Friday, Friday.
[3029.40 → 3031.10] Gotta get down on Friday.
[3031.80 → 3034.08] Something, something, something for the weekend.
[3034.58 → 3035.30] Weekend.
[3035.64 → 3037.24] Friday, Friday.
[3037.24 → 3037.28] Friday.
[3037.28 → 3037.38] Friday.
[3037.38 → 3037.42] Friday.
[3037.42 → 3037.44] Friday.
