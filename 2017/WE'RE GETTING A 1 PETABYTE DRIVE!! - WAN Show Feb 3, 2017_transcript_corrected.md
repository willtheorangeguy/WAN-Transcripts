[0.00 → 5.16] All righty, it's nice, it's welcome to the show.
[6.16 → 7.66] Hey, nice shirt. I like that shirt.
[7.98 → 9.10] I actually don't know what mine is.
[9.10 → 12.36] It's actually one of my favourite shirts that we have.
[12.56 → 13.26] I like that one.
[13.46 → 14.16] It's just wonderful.
[14.72 → 15.46] Out of ideas.
[15.78 → 19.16] And I feel like this is one of our shirts that you could just wear randomly,
[19.34 → 21.96] and people might get a sensible chuckle out of it,
[22.04 → 23.32] even if they don't know what the point is.
[23.38 → 23.78] Exactly.
[24.78 → 27.24] And that is what Linus Tech Tips is all about.
[27.24 → 31.06] Getting a little chuckle out of it, even if you have no idea what the point was.
[31.50 → 32.66] Welcome to the WAN show.
[33.94 → 35.88] We got a great show for you guys today.
[36.02 → 39.48] Actually, I'm really not that sold on today being a great show.
[39.74 → 39.90] No.
[40.48 → 42.48] But sometimes those are the best shows.
[43.40 → 43.80] Sure.
[44.92 → 50.02] So there's, like, electric vehicle news, which usually, like, ratings are just, like,
[50.08 → 51.78] when we talk about that.
[51.84 → 53.78] But we'll talk about it anyway.
[54.62 → 56.74] Samsung, more Note 7 news.
[56.74 → 57.02] Wow.
[57.10 → 58.86] And then that's it for main topics.
[60.66 → 64.44] Then we go to Rapid Fire, which is where we put topics that we're very unsure about.
[64.44 → 69.48] Logitech has a new remote for giving the best PowerPoint presentations ever.
[69.70 → 71.20] Oh, God.
[72.52 → 78.90] And in other news, surprise, surprise, Time Warner cheated customers on Internet speed.
[79.76 → 82.70] Noctua is releasing CPU coolers.
[82.70 → 84.28] For rising.
[85.58 → 87.46] Which, like, is good, but, like, meh.
[87.52 → 88.20] That was it.
[88.26 → 89.32] That was the show today.
[89.44 → 90.26] Thank you, everybody.
[90.34 → 91.68] And we will see you again next week.
[91.76 → 94.32] Same bat time, same bat channel.
[94.32 → 94.60] Oh.
[97.60 → 98.00] Oh.
[98.34 → 98.74] Oh.
[98.90 → 99.20] Oh.
[99.20 → 102.12] Sure.
[102.12 → 102.16] Sure.
[105.16 → 109.48] And I don't think there's any sound in the intro, because I actually did get Ed to fix
[109.48 → 110.52] it before the show today.
[110.62 → 115.42] But I just sat down, and I did not do the thing.
[115.52 → 118.18] To be fair, you were recording a very cool video.
[118.18 → 124.14] Yes, I was, on a Friday afternoon when I'm supposed to be preparing for WAN show, but,
[124.22 → 131.14] you know, glass houses and stones and not throwing them, because you were also recording
[131.14 → 132.18] a very cool video.
[132.36 → 132.56] Yeah.
[132.88 → 133.16] Yeah.
[133.26 → 134.48] I wasn't trashing on you.
[134.88 → 136.16] I wasn't trashing on you at all.
[136.48 → 136.70] No.
[136.86 → 137.48] No, not at all.
[137.54 → 139.46] I mean, this is not a trash relationship.
[139.64 → 139.76] No.
[140.18 → 141.20] This is a...
[141.20 → 141.82] It's a seat relationship.
[141.92 → 142.26] A seat relationship.
[142.26 → 146.30] That's a reference that no one will get unless they were in this office, in this section
[146.30 → 148.32] of the office before the WAN show went live.
[148.74 → 151.54] Oh, that was a very inappropriate comment that you made.
[152.38 → 152.82] What?
[154.98 → 156.32] Very inappropriate comment.
[156.52 → 157.26] Totally inappropriate.
[157.50 → 157.96] The worst.
[158.08 → 158.92] The worst comment.
[159.84 → 160.86] My friends called me.
[160.94 → 162.52] They were like, it's the worst comment I've ever heard.
[162.54 → 163.80] The worst comment I've ever heard.
[164.76 → 165.30] All right.
[165.32 → 166.24] I'm just firing up Twitch.
[166.86 → 168.00] So, you know what?
[168.16 → 173.80] Since this news is terrible, I am going to create my own news.
[174.44 → 174.98] Oh, wicked.
[174.98 → 182.44] You are going to stall for me for like two minutes while I go grab the most amazing news
[182.44 → 182.70] ever.
[182.96 → 183.22] Okay.
[183.34 → 184.00] So, I'll be right back.
[184.14 → 184.30] Yeah.
[184.62 → 190.32] I guess I'll like lightly talk about a topic because I'm not entirely sure what's going
[190.32 → 191.00] on even.
[191.50 → 196.48] Electric cars and cheap solar could halt fossil fuel growth by 2020.
[199.56 → 200.12] Cool.
[200.48 → 202.76] Honestly, there's not a ton else to say about that.
[203.22 → 204.62] I have no idea where Linus went.
[204.62 → 210.20] It says by 2035, electric vehicles could make up 35% of the road transport market.
[210.60 → 213.28] Over 66% by 2050.
[214.18 → 216.46] This is a report on The Guardian.
[216.94 → 219.02] I don't think I can even show you this right now.
[219.24 → 219.76] Let me see.
[221.18 → 221.92] Here we go.
[221.92 → 227.04] Oh dear.
[227.14 → 227.78] What is this?
[228.50 → 228.82] Okay.
[228.94 → 229.90] No, we're going to switch back.
[230.90 → 231.20] Okay.
[231.70 → 233.62] Is this all you're going to show or are you going to take it out?
[233.62 → 234.90] Okay.
[236.04 → 236.40] Okay.
[236.46 → 237.56] You got to pull that.
[237.74 → 239.46] I'm just going to put it over here.
[240.02 → 240.24] Yeah.
[240.34 → 240.58] Okay.
[241.24 → 242.10] You got to focus now.
[242.40 → 242.84] That's fine.
[243.66 → 243.92] Okay.
[244.08 → 244.30] So.
[244.48 → 245.04] Are we going to open it?
[245.14 → 246.08] Behind me.
[246.42 → 247.06] No, no, no.
[247.12 → 247.74] I'm not going to open it.
[248.10 → 248.98] I'm saving it.
[249.26 → 250.84] I'm saving this moment.
[251.60 → 251.76] So.
[252.32 → 253.24] What does that look?
[253.70 → 254.12] I just.
[254.38 → 255.74] You're going to show them a brown box.
[256.14 → 256.50] Yes.
[256.80 → 257.14] Okay.
[257.34 → 258.22] It doesn't even have.
[258.52 → 258.98] Look at this.
[259.36 → 261.40] It doesn't even have a shipping label on it.
[262.26 → 263.48] No shipping label.
[263.48 → 264.40] So its hand-delivered.
[264.84 → 265.88] Unmarked package.
[268.14 → 271.50] This is for something.
[271.62 → 271.76] Okay.
[272.08 → 275.98] First, these three boxes, because this is one of three.
[276.16 → 276.48] Okay.
[276.48 → 282.00] Will be the most expensive unboxing I have ever done.
[282.36 → 284.46] Why does this happen like every month?
[287.12 → 291.40] The most expensive unboxing I have ever done.
[291.70 → 292.02] Okay.
[292.02 → 292.28] Okay.
[292.42 → 294.84] For now, because there's something more expensive coming.
[295.30 → 295.86] See?
[296.00 → 296.48] Next month.
[296.50 → 296.78] See?
[296.78 → 297.04] Next month.
[297.24 → 297.60] Next month.
[298.34 → 298.60] Okay.
[299.60 → 301.44] These are from Seagate.
[302.12 → 304.16] Oh, I know what this is.
[304.32 → 304.70] Okay.
[304.70 → 307.56] And this is the official announcement.
[308.00 → 308.40] So on.
[308.40 → 308.82] Wow.
[309.02 → 312.44] So next weekend, I'm actually going to be here.
[312.52 → 312.84] Wow.
[313.44 → 316.86] I'm going to be here at the office for both days on the weekend.
[316.86 → 320.36] I'm going to be working on a couple of things.
[320.52 → 324.58] So next weekend, I'm going to be doing an updated look at our server room.
[324.66 → 326.76] The last time you guys saw our server room.
[328.14 → 328.92] Well, okay.
[329.02 → 334.68] The most recent time you guys saw our server room, I was breaking into it by taking the air vent off the door.
[334.68 → 340.92] Which, by the way, would not be a successful way to break into our server room.
[341.26 → 341.40] Okay?
[341.84 → 348.30] So, you know, I hate to bust your bubble, but not everything you see on TV is the truth.
[348.52 → 348.68] Okay?
[349.56 → 356.18] Anyway, I'm doing a server room update where we're going to clean it up because everything in there has been running for almost two years now, some of it.
[357.02 → 362.14] We're going to cable manage it, something that I really should have done a very, very long time ago.
[362.14 → 362.76] It's terrible.
[362.90 → 364.00] It's, like, abominable.
[364.16 → 370.10] Like, you have to kind of step gingerly when you're around the back of the cabinet.
[370.34 → 376.82] Because if you step on the button of a power bar or a power squid, you could potentially knock out a bunch of servers.
[377.68 → 378.96] So that's terrible.
[380.40 → 383.94] I'm going to be doing some server consolidation with VMs.
[383.94 → 396.36] So, like, our surveillance server is going to be combined with a nightly backup server for all the machines in the office and combined with – I've told you about this before.
[396.56 → 410.08] So I'm going to set up, like, might be some combination, but Crash Plan, OwnCloud, some kind of just, like, free cloud backup solution for everyone who works here.
[410.08 → 412.78] So that's going to be one box.
[413.82 → 415.80] I'm moving the network switches to the back.
[416.28 → 420.72] I don't know why I didn't put the network switches in the back in the first place.
[421.40 → 422.74] So I'm going to put those in the back.
[422.88 → 424.08] So that's going to help with cable management.
[424.32 → 427.94] We're changing our Wi-Fi to the new Wave 2 AC Ubiquity gear.
[428.10 → 429.76] So our Wi-Fi is going to be much faster.
[430.04 → 430.40] That's good.
[430.66 → 433.48] We're putting acoustic dampening material.
[433.48 → 436.18] We're lining the entire inside the room.
[436.18 → 436.88] That's also good.
[437.08 → 441.26] With $3,000 worth of acoustic dampening stuff.
[441.34 → 441.60] What?
[442.34 → 447.58] So I got in touch with the guys who – actually, these guys, they're pretty cool.
[447.72 → 453.62] So this was – I talked to Mike from Silent PC Review back when we moved in here.
[453.76 → 454.74] Is this the denim stuff?
[454.74 → 460.56] So this was the stuff that he recommended that we cover the entire inside the warehouse in.
[460.56 → 465.90] And basically, we eventually concluded that it was cost prohibitive.
[466.08 → 469.46] There was no, like, standardized way to mount it.
[469.54 → 478.38] Like, we wouldn't even be able to find a contractor who was going to put, like, in-wall insulation in our rafters because it would block the sprinklers.
[478.46 → 479.96] Like, there were a ton of problems.
[480.06 → 480.76] We didn't do it.
[480.76 → 500.36] But it's this cotton fibre shredded insulation that has wonderful heat thermal characteristics as well as not emitting any odours or chemicals, which we definitely experienced with this cellulose spray-on stuff in here.
[500.46 → 501.18] But it's gone now.
[501.18 → 506.36] And then the other thing that's great about it is that its acoustic properties are unreal.
[506.86 → 508.64] Like, just outstanding.
[508.92 → 517.58] Both in terms of – and there are two different ways that you can measure the – like, the acoustic cancelling and blocking properties of a material.
[518.18 → 519.72] There's the echo reduction.
[519.96 → 521.12] So there's, like, the scattering.
[521.74 → 525.58] And then there's also the stopping, like, the blocking from transmission.
[525.58 → 528.76] And this is excellent for both.
[529.04 → 539.94] So we're going to line the entire inside the room, and we're going to set up dust filtration on the backup intake and exhaust of the room so that – well, just the intake, actually.
[540.84 → 546.98] So that in the event that the air conditioning system, which has been added since the last update – like, it's been overhauled.
[547.54 → 554.52] So the air conditioning system, in the event that that fails, it won't completely suffocate in there, and I'll have some time to go and deal with it.
[554.52 → 555.52] Okay.
[555.52 → 555.56] Okay.
[556.22 → 567.28] The last thing that I'm doing is I'm making room for a project that has been in the works with Seagate and 45 drives for months now.
[567.34 → 567.44] Oh, a while.
[567.64 → 568.62] Yeah, for quite a while.
[569.14 → 574.34] And it has been in preparation for us to move to shooting 8K.
[574.64 → 577.04] So some of you probably noticed – I'll just go grab it.
[579.10 → 580.26] Especially on Flow plane.
[581.58 → 584.20] Yeah, we can talk about Flow plane updates after, actually.
[584.52 → 596.76] So some of you may have noticed, especially those of you who have watched the Desk PC finale, where we do a bunch of glam footage shot on red.
[597.02 → 600.26] We've actually got an Epic W with the helium sensor now.
[600.44 → 610.14] So we are shooting our videos at somewhere between 6K and 8K, depending on how Brandon wants to utilize the different sensor crops and all that stuff.
[610.14 → 610.58] Okay.
[611.14 → 611.54] Okay.
[611.74 → 613.16] So that's a big storage problem.
[613.88 → 618.16] And I'm a pack rat, digital pack rat, physical pack rat.
[618.46 → 619.10] I'm a pack rat.
[619.84 → 621.56] The first step is admitting you have a problem.
[621.74 → 623.40] The second step is completely ignoring it.
[623.40 → 624.12] I was just going to say.
[624.12 → 626.10] And getting more storage.
[626.22 → 633.56] So I'm trying to figure out how to archive this stuff at some kind of reasonable approximation of the original quality.
[634.86 → 636.02] That's where this comes in.
[636.08 → 639.82] We have officially outgrown Unpaid for the vault.
[639.82 → 648.24] I'm actually going to be using Unpaid for that multipurpose machine with the Windows VMs for surveillance and the crash plan thing and all that stuff.
[648.62 → 651.16] So that is actually going to be like a 100 terabyte plus machine.
[651.38 → 654.94] So there will be a lot of storage on there for everyone here, which is going to be super cool.
[655.30 → 658.08] But anyway, we have outgrown that for the vault.
[658.08 → 665.84] And this box behind me is for something that I'm calling my pet project.
[667.64 → 675.78] And pet is short for, as some of you are probably guessing in Twitch chat right now, petabyte.
[675.78 → 690.48] Yes, my friends, the goal is to have a single addressable volume network share, okay, with a petabyte of total space.
[690.72 → 697.82] So we're going to take all 170 or so, 180 or so terabytes that are on the current vault.
[698.02 → 699.98] We're going to migrate them over to this.
[699.98 → 710.28] The whole thing is going to be using a combination of probably CentOS with ZFS and then Clusters running over top of it so that we can actually –
[710.28 → 713.16] because, I mean, how do you put a petabyte worth of drives in one box?
[713.22 → 713.56] You don't.
[714.32 → 718.34] So we're going to have two 60 drive coordinators.
[718.56 → 718.90] You're right.
[718.96 → 719.58] It is coming soon.
[719.96 → 723.56] Two 60 drive coordinators that are going to be running as a cluster.
[725.32 → 727.84] And then possibly a solid state cache in front of it.
[727.84 → 728.54] What are you using for that?
[728.54 → 730.04] What OS?
[730.56 → 734.66] We're using CentOS with ZFS, and then we're using Clusters over top of it.
[734.66 → 734.74] CentOS.
[735.04 → 736.08] So it's come full circle.
[736.94 → 738.14] The forum used to be CentOS.
[738.92 → 739.66] There you go.
[739.84 → 750.02] So this is – that and the other two boxes is 110 terabyte Seagate Enterprise capacity drives.
[750.70 → 751.86] A hundred of them.
[751.86 → 753.66] And then in order to –
[753.66 → 754.08] Oh, man.
[754.22 → 762.22] In order to achieve the addressable one petabyte space, I'm going to borrow some of the six and eight terabytes that they sent me before.
[762.42 → 766.06] And I'm going to create a couple more Cluster bricks so we can show that big number.
[766.06 → 767.18] Is there an estimated value?
[768.24 → 768.60] Yeah.
[768.72 → 770.88] I believe it's about 60 grand worth of drives.
[774.52 → 777.60] This is why, like, sometimes I have a hard time coming up with video ideas.
[777.86 → 785.08] And I think it's because, like, my brain never goes to that space where it's like, yeah, I'll just, you know, 80 grand.
[785.08 → 789.28] I'm going to try it like – I just – like, ah.
[792.98 → 793.38] Yeah.
[793.98 → 796.88] My personal rig, which is coming soon because it's done now.
[798.80 → 799.94] Yeah, you should talk about it.
[800.06 → 803.46] I spent, like, $160 on amethyst crystals.
[803.88 → 804.24] Yeah.
[804.24 → 805.68] And I felt, like, terrible.
[806.18 → 808.46] I was like, that's a lot of money for a mod.
[809.36 → 812.00] Ah, there are cases that are cheaper than this.
[812.06 → 812.64] A lot of them.
[812.72 → 813.84] A lot of perfect cases.
[813.84 → 817.46] Literally the case that I'm using is cheaper than this.
[818.78 → 822.52] Anyway, I guess I can talk about my now underwhelming project of my personal rig.
[822.82 → 823.10] What?
[823.16 → 823.98] It's not underwhelming.
[824.04 → 824.40] It looks really cool.
[824.40 → 825.70] Compared to a petabyte server?
[826.16 → 826.98] Well, you know.
[827.88 → 828.28] Okay.
[828.40 → 832.48] We don't want to fall into the seven gamers, one CPU trap again, okay?
[832.92 → 834.22] Technically, it's two servers.
[834.80 → 835.02] Yeah.
[835.08 → 835.30] Okay?
[835.54 → 835.74] Yeah.
[835.82 → 836.10] Okay.
[836.16 → 837.32] Look, we're not going to do that anymore.
[837.40 → 839.46] I should totally call it one petabyte, one server.
[839.66 → 840.04] You should.
[840.72 → 841.90] I should totally do it.
[842.02 → 843.74] I should have them silkscreen.
[843.84 → 845.16] On the front of the machines.
[845.52 → 847.02] One petabyte, one server.
[847.10 → 847.46] On both of them.
[847.46 → 849.56] You should piss people off by calling it a drive.
[849.82 → 852.72] Because it looks like a drive when you access it.
[854.60 → 856.30] One, one petabyte drive.
[857.52 → 858.92] It's a network drive.
[858.96 → 860.64] So I'm going to open up the HDD.
[860.64 → 865.10] Oh, man.
[865.40 → 866.40] Anyway, personal rig.
[866.78 → 867.88] Snap PC's one.
[867.96 → 868.62] It's already got it.
[868.88 → 870.06] Crystal healing PC.
[870.74 → 871.18] Oh.
[871.86 → 873.68] I didn't push that that much in the video.
[874.10 → 882.50] Before the video, John and I spent, like, weeks talking about how the amethyst crystals were, like, going to heal us and bring more positive energy into the benchmarking environment.
[882.50 → 885.74] And then we, yeah.
[885.92 → 888.14] I decided not to push that way too much in the video.
[888.18 → 889.36] Just because I thought it would get boring.
[889.60 → 895.48] And there were so many crazy things that happened that I was like, I'm just going to focus on the crazy building things.
[896.86 → 898.04] Should I say some of this stuff?
[898.04 → 898.66] Yeah, sure.
[898.76 → 899.28] Go for it.
[899.34 → 901.58] I mean, realistically, like, come on.
[901.62 → 902.58] These are the WAN show viewers.
[902.58 → 903.60] These are the hardcore.
[903.74 → 904.30] They're going to watch it.
[904.30 → 911.82] And nothing you say right now is going to take away the experience of the Brandon Glam B-roll at the end.
[911.92 → 912.48] That's fair.
[912.80 → 913.04] Right?
[913.22 → 914.10] That is very fair.
[914.64 → 921.44] There's B-roll of my crazy, like, amethyst gem geode computer shot on a red.
[921.94 → 923.40] So that'll look pretty good.
[923.58 → 930.82] The cooler that I used for it, which was a Cryonic R1 Ultimate, very much didn't fit.
[930.82 → 934.62] It wasn't like a couple millimetres.
[934.86 → 936.64] Like, it was a huge amount of not fitting.
[936.64 → 943.04] He comes up to my office, and he's like, do you think if I start ripping things off with pliers?
[943.48 → 950.32] And I'm just like, I just found it.
[951.10 → 955.82] I'm like, I don't know if that is a...
[955.82 → 957.38] He told me not to do it.
[957.38 → 962.28] And then while we were sitting there talking about something else, I just decided to do it anyway.
[963.26 → 965.64] But, spoiler alert, I started from the top.
[965.98 → 966.76] Just in time.
[966.78 → 972.26] So he starts doing it just in time for me to be like, oh, but if you did it this way...
[972.26 → 972.78] Yeah.
[974.02 → 975.92] Because I'm like, whatever, I'm going to try it.
[975.96 → 979.38] So I start ripping from the top, and he's like, yo, if you just take them off the bottom,
[979.52 → 981.88] then you can keep it looking aesthetically nice at the top.
[981.88 → 985.78] So then I had to try to figure out how to reattach it so that it doesn't look terrible.
[985.78 → 986.52] Reattach fins to a heat sink.
[986.66 → 986.86] Yeah.
[987.02 → 988.80] Okay, so you'll get to watch that adventure.
[988.96 → 989.22] Yeah.
[989.52 → 993.94] So this is like half an hour in I run into this problem.
[994.30 → 1000.58] Two hours later, this cooler that doesn't fit by entire fin length,
[1000.72 → 1005.28] then some heat pipe collision was happening too, I get it to fit.
[1006.28 → 1009.02] I'm going to leave out how I get the heat pipes to fit.
[1009.60 → 1011.30] If it fits, Luke sits, man.
[1014.98 → 1015.88] Oh my goodness.
[1016.10 → 1016.38] Brutal.
[1017.86 → 1020.08] But yeah, I got the CPU cooler to work.
[1020.14 → 1021.46] You put that heat pipe back in there?
[1021.66 → 1022.40] Yeah, I did.
[1022.86 → 1025.56] It was close, but you've got to work it.
[1025.92 → 1030.86] And then after a little while of just repeated, you just don't want to push too far
[1030.86 → 1032.16] because then you might rupture the heat pipes.
[1033.42 → 1033.78] Ew.
[1034.26 → 1034.88] That's true.
[1034.88 → 1035.50] That's true.
[1035.84 → 1036.72] That is true.
[1037.08 → 1041.80] And once the heat pipes lose their inner juice, they're not effective anymore.
[1042.06 → 1042.18] Yeah.
[1043.34 → 1047.92] Did you know heat pipes have liquid in them?
[1047.96 → 1048.16] Yeah.
[1048.52 → 1050.18] That travels up and then goes back down?
[1050.18 → 1053.00] Not necessarily liquid, but they do have fluid in them for sure.
[1053.98 → 1056.06] Because technically liquid and gas are both fluids.
[1057.14 → 1060.06] We're trying to be very scientific on the show moving forward.
[1060.14 → 1060.32] Yeah.
[1061.48 → 1062.60] So healing crystals.
[1062.60 → 1063.44] Yeah.
[1063.44 → 1063.52] Yeah.
[1063.72 → 1068.66] And then so I figured that out and go that way for a little while.
[1068.82 → 1071.70] And then I have to figure out how to put all these freaking...
[1071.70 → 1073.92] Because in my mind, I was just like, yeah, it's a great case.
[1073.98 → 1074.94] I'll make it look like a geode.
[1074.94 → 1078.60] It's not that simple.
[1078.82 → 1080.36] There's a lot to it.
[1080.36 → 1082.72] Another visit to Linus's office later.
[1083.50 → 1088.30] How would you glue rocks to the inside of a computer?
[1088.60 → 1091.64] And I'm like, well, gee, Luke, I've never really thought about that.
[1092.04 → 1093.68] I've never had a desire to do that.
[1093.68 → 1095.18] I also emailed Rod.
[1095.84 → 1096.20] Yes.
[1096.54 → 1097.62] And you know what's funny about this?
[1097.68 → 1099.86] I emailed Rod like...
[1099.86 → 1102.28] What I'm going to guess off the top of my head was three months ago.
[1102.54 → 1102.76] Yeah.
[1102.86 → 1105.54] And he suggested exactly how it should have gone.
[1106.32 → 1107.90] And I completely forgot.
[1108.24 → 1110.76] And then ended up figuring it out through trial and error.
[1110.90 → 1112.78] And then doing exactly what he had told me.
[1112.90 → 1116.94] If I just listened to him from the start, everything would have been fine.
[1117.02 → 1118.96] Rod from BS Mods knows best, man.
[1118.96 → 1125.18] He saw part of a channel super fun where when I'm on the phone because they're trying to prank me, I'm sitting beside it working on it.
[1125.30 → 1125.52] Yeah.
[1125.58 → 1127.28] And he was like, I saw some amethyst.
[1127.68 → 1128.48] You're working on it.
[1128.52 → 1129.38] That's really cool.
[1129.74 → 1131.08] And then I'm like, oh, man.
[1131.10 → 1132.38] But he replied to that email thread.
[1132.44 → 1133.54] I had completely forgotten about it.
[1133.54 → 1133.64] Right.
[1133.72 → 1136.76] And I'm like, I wonder if he told me to do it the way that I ended up doing it.
[1136.76 → 1142.88] Go up, and he says exactly like word for word exactly where the LEDs should go even.
[1143.30 → 1144.08] So that it looks better.
[1146.58 → 1147.46] All right.
[1147.58 → 1147.78] Anyway.
[1147.78 → 1152.60] Moving on to some actual news from this week that is not internal LMG news.
[1152.62 → 1152.82] Is there any point?
[1153.44 → 1157.84] Samsung is committed to whatever that says.
[1159.16 → 1159.68] Quality.
[1159.84 → 1160.52] There we go.
[1161.14 → 1167.82] We learned from the Galaxy Note 7 issues and have made changes as a result.
[1168.08 → 1168.62] Like last time?
[1169.66 → 1173.36] Like the first time that they learned from the Galaxy Note 7 issues and then made changes as a result?
[1173.46 → 1175.98] There's also something about top load washers.
[1175.98 → 1177.86] There's a see details link here as well.
[1177.92 → 1178.16] Anyway.
[1178.64 → 1184.66] The point is Samsung's new and enhanced quality assurance measures are for product safety.
[1184.80 → 1185.98] You can watch a video about it.
[1186.08 → 1187.74] Samsung's got that linked on their site.
[1187.74 → 1189.12] So the first...
[1189.12 → 1190.60] We should do a factory tour.
[1191.32 → 1193.88] They should show us their new quality assurance measures.
[1193.94 → 1194.60] That would be pretty cool.
[1194.66 → 1196.62] And we should broadcast to the world.
[1196.70 → 1197.36] I'd be totally down.
[1197.44 → 1200.32] I was trying to get LG to let us come see their display manufacturing.
[1200.54 → 1201.46] Oh, that would have been really awesome.
[1201.46 → 1202.74] Which would have been really cool.
[1202.90 → 1204.00] I would love how to see that.
[1204.00 → 1209.74] The thing about LG is that like as far as...
[1209.74 → 1210.10] Like, okay.
[1210.62 → 1215.82] I think that industry is secretive to the point where like maybe not quite the...
[1215.82 → 1216.58] I forget his name.
[1216.72 → 1224.76] The Soviet rocket scientist who couldn't even be given a Nobel Prize because the Soviets kept his name a secret.
[1224.98 → 1227.22] And he wasn't allowed to have photographs taken of him.
[1227.22 → 1232.80] Like he only got secret medals that he wasn't allowed to wear or show anybody.
[1233.84 → 1235.30] Like Soviet Russia, man.
[1235.84 → 1237.20] Like I don't think it's quite like that.
[1237.44 → 1243.08] But I think it's to the point where they don't even really want people seeing like the layout of the floor.
[1243.20 → 1245.82] And like how many people work on that and whatever.
[1246.04 → 1247.26] Because there's a lot of...
[1247.26 → 1251.46] I mean, the Korean super giants are like hyper-competitive.
[1252.26 → 1254.04] So I understand why they didn't let us do it.
[1254.04 → 1264.64] So anyway, the TLDR of the Samsung thing is the first battery issue was the negative electro tips touching each other in a curved way causing a negative charge to occur.
[1265.18 → 1272.76] The second battery issue was an abnormal weld spot in the middle left of the battery that caused it to short circuit.
[1273.10 → 1278.52] So in their commitment to quality article, they address why this won't happen again.
[1278.52 → 1284.58] So it's quality first, which means improved processes throughout the company to make sure quality and safety comes first.
[1285.14 → 1286.98] I wonder what was first before.
[1287.22 → 1287.42] Yeah.
[1288.12 → 1289.98] Like I'm not saying that...
[1289.98 → 1292.40] I'm not saying like this is a bad thing to say.
[1292.60 → 1299.76] And I'm not even suggesting that quality and safety first wasn't already the way that they were designing products.
[1299.86 → 1301.52] I'm just wondering...
[1301.52 → 1303.94] I'm just...
[1303.94 → 1308.10] So they're just like saying like, yes, and we'll do it better this time.
[1308.64 → 1308.90] Okay.
[1308.96 → 1311.70] So there's an eight point battery safety check now.
[1311.70 → 1321.70] So an extensive battery check protocol to ensure the safety of the battery, which includes durability tests, charge discharge tests, visual inspection tests, OCV test, VOC...
[1322.42 → 1324.12] I'm not sure exactly what that is.
[1324.20 → 1328.70] X-ray test, accelerated usage test, and disassembling test.
[1328.70 → 1329.22] Test.
[1329.76 → 1330.24] Okay.
[1330.44 → 1332.48] They've got multi-layer safety measures.
[1332.66 → 1338.00] I love how the VOC test literally just says additional testing to ensure battery integrity.
[1339.76 → 1341.12] I'm going to look up what this is.
[1341.22 → 1343.70] Let's say test validating...
[1343.70 → 1347.98] Test validation of cells.
[1348.76 → 1349.18] VOC.
[1349.84 → 1351.24] Testing and validation of cells.
[1351.44 → 1351.64] There.
[1351.74 → 1352.42] The O is capital.
[1352.58 → 1353.56] Well, you know what?
[1353.66 → 1355.08] I made it up on the spot.
[1355.08 → 1363.30] VOC is a grouping of a wide range of organic chemical compounds to simplify reporting when these are present in ambient air or emissions.
[1363.60 → 1369.74] Many substances such as natural gas could be classified as volatile organic compounds.
[1369.76 → 1369.98] Okay.
[1369.98 → 1371.34] That's a completely different thing.
[1371.42 → 1372.54] That has nothing to do with this.
[1372.72 → 1376.08] Total volatile organic compounds.
[1376.08 → 1377.08] Okay.
[1378.40 → 1380.30] So, it's a multi-layer safety measure.
[1380.50 → 1385.34] So, the idea is to improve safety standards for their batteries from hardware design to software protection.
[1385.92 → 1392.58] They also have a team of experts from academia and from research centres to objectively analyze the safety of their batteries called the BAG.
[1392.92 → 1396.44] Or they're calling it Battery Advisory Group, but I like the BAG better.
[1397.70 → 1398.10] Okay.
[1398.48 → 1399.08] The BAG.
[1399.30 → 1399.72] The BAG.
[1399.72 → 1404.40] Did you cover electric cars and cheap solar?
[1404.92 → 1406.12] Did it halt fossil fuel growth?
[1406.22 → 1406.68] Sort of.
[1406.86 → 1407.30] Sort of?
[1407.38 → 1409.24] But it's very uninteresting.
[1409.46 → 1409.72] Okay.
[1409.78 → 1409.98] Cool.
[1410.80 → 1411.76] So, let's move on.
[1412.16 → 1413.02] This is interesting.
[1413.22 → 1415.72] So, this was posted by Tom's Always Wins on the forum.
[1415.72 → 1417.90] I'm, like, rather certain that's actually what it is, by the way.
[1418.14 → 1418.92] The VOC thing.
[1419.18 → 1419.58] Oh, really?
[1419.74 → 1419.92] Yeah.
[1420.10 → 1420.28] Oh.
[1420.96 → 1421.26] Okay.
[1421.86 → 1422.80] Well, you win, maybe.
[1423.28 → 1424.16] Maybe, yeah.
[1424.66 → 1426.78] I'm not 100% certain.
[1426.78 → 1429.40] So, the original article here is from The Verge.
[1429.84 → 1434.28] Apple has filed a patent for some sort of vaporizer.
[1434.86 → 1436.58] So, here's the diagram.
[1437.14 → 1438.34] So, there's a lid.
[1438.92 → 1439.32] Okay.
[1440.32 → 1441.20] There's a vapour.
[1441.82 → 1445.50] There's a substance being vaporized or sublimated.
[1446.54 → 1449.56] There's a heater, which is here, I guess.
[1450.26 → 1450.62] And a plate.
[1450.62 → 1451.68] You can patent this.
[1451.70 → 1452.28] Which is here.
[1452.70 → 1453.68] There's a chamber body.
[1453.68 → 1458.58] And it should be noted that the chamber body, you can tell from the little lines going this way, are separate from the lid.
[1459.42 → 1459.66] Okay.
[1460.08 → 1461.08] So, it's not sealed.
[1461.34 → 1461.48] Okay.
[1461.60 → 1462.98] You can patent this.
[1466.56 → 1467.00] What?
[1467.76 → 1468.78] Well, hold on a second.
[1469.10 → 1471.72] They published a patent application.
[1472.34 → 1472.70] Okay.
[1472.88 → 1476.06] That details a peculiar vaporizer technology.
[1476.30 → 1476.56] Okay.
[1476.56 → 1481.26] So, I mean, okay.
[1481.46 → 1488.84] So, some folks might, maybe this is, you know, wishful thinking for some people out there, might go, oh, wow, the eye vape.
[1492.04 → 1492.48] Probably.
[1493.04 → 1495.26] I would be very surprised.
[1495.48 → 1496.42] Probably not.
[1496.42 → 1507.62] But, basically, the plan is for the apparatus to be able to regulate temperature to release heat from a substance within a canister.
[1508.08 → 1514.12] They also want to be able to keep air out of the chamber with the substance being vaporized.
[1514.12 → 1520.02] So, I mean, e-cigarette could be a potential application.
[1521.66 → 1526.72] Air freshener for a car is one of the other suggestions in the doc, though I'm not really sure about that.
[1527.54 → 1530.28] No other information available.
[1530.66 → 1531.82] I have no idea.
[1532.10 → 1533.24] I couldn't possibly imagine.
[1533.30 → 1535.76] What would you do with a vaporizer if you were Apple?
[1536.08 → 1541.86] Would you maybe put it in your stores so that Apple stores would have a particular scent?
[1542.42 → 1542.78] Okay.
[1543.42 → 1543.70] Huh?
[1543.80 → 1545.94] Maybe it would be a more efficient way to have an Apple scent?
[1546.42 → 1546.66] Yeah.
[1546.76 → 1547.22] In your store?
[1547.40 → 1547.60] Yeah.
[1548.08 → 1553.94] And it could be, like, a good-looking thing that makes the scent instead of, like, a hidden scent thing that a lot of stores use.
[1554.18 → 1554.42] Yep.
[1554.50 → 1557.80] They've done, like, a lot of, oh, that could even be a product.
[1558.46 → 1559.02] The eye smell.
[1562.94 → 1564.40] I'm sure they call it something other than that.
[1564.54 → 1565.14] Yeah, probably.
[1566.02 → 1568.84] It is being, like, weed is being legalized in a lot of states.
[1569.90 → 1571.04] Oh, I can't even.
[1571.04 → 1572.28] I seriously doubt it.
[1572.40 → 1572.86] I can't even.
[1572.86 → 1573.52] But it could be them.
[1573.62 → 1573.96] No, no, no.
[1574.00 → 1575.84] But it could be them patent trolling a little bit.
[1576.94 → 1577.60] Here's an idea.
[1577.70 → 1578.32] Let's patent it.
[1578.48 → 1579.82] If someone wants to use it, they're going to have to pay us.
[1580.92 → 1581.28] Hmm.
[1582.34 → 1582.70] Maybe.
[1583.12 → 1585.58] That's my, that's as far as I'm willing to reach in that direction.
[1585.64 → 1586.84] I have a hard time.
[1586.90 → 1597.24] I mean, Apple's stance on pornography, even, in the early days of the iPhone, was, like, Jobs basically didn't want boobs on his device.
[1597.24 → 1599.64] But Jobs is pretty down with the drugs.
[1600.48 → 1600.84] Okay.
[1600.94 → 1601.24] Or was.
[1601.50 → 1602.00] Okay.
[1602.32 → 1603.34] This is true.
[1603.48 → 1610.30] But what I mean is, like, they take a fairly conservative stance as a company.
[1610.30 → 1620.16] And I don't mean, like, necessarily conservative in the sense that, you know, their CEO can't be out of the closet gay.
[1620.16 → 1625.06] I just mean, like, they don't have, you know, an drink.
[1625.68 → 1636.16] You know, like, they, even though, you know, wine culture in California is absolutely a thing, one of the preloaded things on your iPhone isn't wine.
[1637.38 → 1643.20] You know, like, a curated way to, you know, buy wine with Apple Pay online or whatever.
[1643.20 → 1650.12] Like, they just, they could easily do any of these things, but they don't.
[1650.18 → 1656.98] They leave that to the third-party app developers to come up with, like, you know, a smoking tracker or whatever the case may be.
[1657.10 → 1657.50] Like, whatever.
[1658.78 → 1662.14] So I just, I can't imagine them doing it.
[1662.80 → 1663.60] But I could be wrong.
[1664.46 → 1665.20] I don't know, man.
[1666.28 → 1667.70] That doesn't make a ton of sense.
[1668.94 → 1669.38] Okay.
[1669.38 → 1674.18] So, moving on to the most interesting topic we have today.
[1674.30 → 1674.78] The most interesting topic.
[1674.78 → 1676.64] More interesting than all those drives.
[1677.68 → 1680.02] The Gartner Summit's Data Summit.
[1680.60 → 1680.84] What?
[1681.24 → 1682.42] No, this is the Logitech.
[1682.90 → 1683.70] Oh, okay.
[1683.74 → 1684.42] I was making a joke.
[1684.50 → 1685.50] I didn't even see the ad.
[1685.56 → 1686.70] I don't even see ads.
[1687.10 → 1688.98] I don't, I'm not aware that they exist.
[1689.16 → 1691.28] I just, it's like muscle memory.
[1691.62 → 1692.22] Don't look, don't look.
[1692.44 → 1693.38] What ad was on your page?
[1695.96 → 1696.16] Yeah.
[1696.38 → 1696.76] Go, Daddy.
[1696.82 → 1697.24] Go, Daddy.
[1697.24 → 1697.50] Yeah.
[1697.50 → 1700.26] I had no idea.
[1700.72 → 1702.52] I just, I would have gone like this.
[1702.74 → 1705.50] And I would have gone, this pertains to my interests.
[1705.50 → 1705.54] And it's gone.
[1707.04 → 1708.78] Okay, so this is fancy and new.
[1708.88 → 1711.66] Okay, so I actually got briefed on this earlier this week.
[1711.96 → 1712.36] Okay.
[1712.50 → 1714.06] Without asking my permission.
[1714.20 → 1715.30] I love it when this happens.
[1715.50 → 1719.00] Like, NVIDIA will do this with graphics cards that they know that nobody cares about.
[1719.40 → 1720.48] They'll email you.
[1720.60 → 1726.04] They're like, the whatever 40 GS is in the mail.
[1726.04 → 1726.40] Yeah.
[1727.36 → 1728.68] Here's your reviewer's guide.
[1728.72 → 1729.00] Yeah.
[1729.20 → 1733.98] And you're just like, yeah, I really wasn't going to review this.
[1734.38 → 1737.76] I mean, now I feel obligated because there's a graphics card in the mail.
[1737.84 → 1742.86] It's like, it's not like I feel obligated because you've like paid me for my time in some way.
[1742.90 → 1745.14] I mean, we're talking about, you know, an $80 graphics card.
[1745.26 → 1745.58] Like there is.
[1745.58 → 1746.80] I thought you were going to say we're talking about NVIDIA.
[1746.80 → 1749.46] No, it's just, it's like, it's more like a social obligation.
[1749.46 → 1751.88] Like, you know, you did a thing.
[1752.00 → 1752.86] You involved me.
[1752.96 → 1756.00] You made me feel like part of the pre-launch experience.
[1756.30 → 1758.54] Maybe I should actually review it on time.
[1758.62 → 1758.86] Maybe.
[1759.76 → 1760.20] Anyway.
[1760.34 → 1761.68] So they pulled one of those on me.
[1761.78 → 1763.46] The, the, what's it called?
[1763.54 → 1766.28] The Logitech Spotlight was already in the mail.
[1766.76 → 1767.70] Oh, this is a spotlight.
[1767.98 → 1768.10] Oh.
[1768.16 → 1768.30] Yeah.
[1768.30 → 1769.08] This is the spotlight.
[1769.08 → 1774.98] The Logitech Spotlight was already in the mail by the time I got my briefing call on it.
[1775.08 → 1775.98] You're going to use it now.
[1777.00 → 1777.66] For what?
[1777.74 → 1780.36] You're going to end up using it in some weird video.
[1780.50 → 1780.74] Okay.
[1780.76 → 1781.60] It's actually possible.
[1782.00 → 1786.76] So Logitech's whole thing is like, we're going to reimagine the presentation remote.
[1787.18 → 1788.12] That needed to happen.
[1788.26 → 1788.54] Okay.
[1788.88 → 1789.76] So tell me this.
[1789.76 → 1790.12] Yeah.
[1790.38 → 1793.18] Let's talk in like super corporate boring terms.
[1793.30 → 1793.54] Okay.
[1793.98 → 1795.24] I don't do very well with that, but okay.
[1795.24 → 1799.40] What are your pain points when it comes to giving presentations?
[1801.12 → 1802.44] You know, pain points, right?
[1802.82 → 1805.40] Like that's like addressing a customer need.
[1805.48 → 1805.96] That's what they're called.
[1806.00 → 1806.86] They're called pain points.
[1807.50 → 1811.46] I don't really feel like I would have any major ones.
[1811.74 → 1812.78] No major pain points?
[1812.94 → 1815.76] I would feel like if someone was telecommuting in.
[1816.38 → 1816.62] Yeah.
[1816.68 → 1819.98] I feel like the hardware and software to support that is extremely subpar.
[1820.14 → 1820.40] No, no.
[1820.44 → 1822.36] This is for in-person presentations.
[1823.20 → 1823.60] Yeah.
[1823.60 → 1824.88] They mostly seem fine.
[1825.24 → 1828.14] Okay.
[1828.32 → 1828.56] So.
[1828.78 → 1830.50] I don't have anything else to say there.
[1830.70 → 1832.14] I've given presentations too.
[1832.36 → 1832.50] Yeah.
[1832.50 → 1834.28] Back when I was in school, I had to like present to.
[1835.08 → 1835.22] Yeah.
[1835.30 → 1835.52] Okay.
[1835.60 → 1837.46] So the openings, the opening slide.
[1837.58 → 1838.80] I'm sure they have something amazing.
[1838.90 → 1839.14] Yeah.
[1839.34 → 1846.06] The deck that I was shown was like some percentage of people fear public speaking more than death,
[1846.06 → 1851.82] which is like obviously like a flawed study.
[1851.82 → 1852.78] We've all heard it before.
[1852.78 → 1853.80] You've heard that before, right?
[1854.28 → 1854.32] Yeah.
[1854.32 → 1855.70] Which is ridiculous.
[1855.96 → 1857.96] I've never had a problem with that even before this job.
[1858.08 → 1860.92] If you ask, well, it's not even about whether you personally would.
[1860.92 → 1865.90] It's about the way that they must be collecting data for this study.
[1865.90 → 1867.60] I mean, you can't call that a study.
[1867.86 → 1874.56] Because there are two ways that you can collect data about what someone would prefer to speak
[1874.56 → 1876.68] in front of a large audience or to die.
[1876.68 → 1887.52] You can ask them on the phone, hey, so question 6B, would you rather, or you can hold a gun
[1887.52 → 1892.98] to their head and be like, start talking, or I'm going to blow your freaking brains all
[1892.98 → 1894.04] over the they'll start talking.
[1894.04 → 1894.80] Everyone will start talking.
[1894.82 → 1895.56] They'll start talking.
[1895.60 → 1900.32] And then even, I bet you it was a mass survey of a bunch of questions and you
[1900.32 → 1901.56] had to rate it on a scale.
[1902.36 → 1903.68] And then people went public speaking.
[1904.00 → 1905.22] That's a zero.
[1905.52 → 1906.58] I hate doing that.
[1906.68 → 1907.60] And then it was like death.
[1907.68 → 1910.56] And they're like, hmm, I'm not afraid of anything.
[1910.92 → 1913.76] I'm going to put a three because I am satisfied with my life.
[1913.90 → 1914.68] Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[1915.68 → 1917.68] It's probably just weird emotional response stuff.
[1917.92 → 1918.20] Yeah.
[1918.20 → 1925.16] So anyway, so one of the features it has is that in a minute, you can get three hours
[1925.16 → 1926.44] of presentation battery life.
[1927.68 → 1932.44] So like, if you were stuck, I think it's three hours.
[1933.36 → 1934.36] Is it six hours?
[1934.54 → 1935.50] It was like a lot.
[1935.50 → 1939.58] It was like actually, it was actually pretty impressive.
[1939.84 → 1940.64] Like, that's cool.
[1941.38 → 1941.70] Whatever.
[1941.86 → 1944.32] In a minute, you can get hours of presentation time.
[1945.00 → 1946.72] So that's kind of neat.
[1946.80 → 1949.40] So if like you would stress about, oh no, my remote's not working.
[1949.48 → 1950.76] How am I going to give this presentation?
[1950.90 → 1953.22] I'm doing like a TED talk or something.
[1953.22 → 1954.76] I think TED would have you covered.
[1954.96 → 1956.76] I think TED would probably have a backup remote.
[1956.88 → 1959.18] But look, we're trying to, we're finding pain points, okay?
[1959.40 → 1959.60] Yeah.
[1959.74 → 1960.36] We're finding pain points.
[1960.36 → 1962.08] I feel like TED would have someone else actually run into presentation.
[1962.08 → 1963.14] We're finding pain points.
[1963.52 → 1965.88] Unless you're doing a TEDx, the independent ones.
[1966.52 → 1969.06] Then maybe you bring your own, depending on the size.
[1969.24 → 1970.72] Some of them are done in like basements and stuff.
[1970.72 → 1971.04] Okay.
[1971.22 → 1976.06] So it can communicate via Bluetooth, or it has a dongle that slides into the bottom and
[1976.06 → 1977.96] also acts as like a handy dandy little loop.
[1978.22 → 1978.46] Okay.
[1978.46 → 1981.68] Though personally, if I were to put a loop on a product, I would have it be a loop that
[1981.68 → 1983.26] does not detach from the product.
[1984.42 → 1985.52] So there's that.
[1985.58 → 1986.96] That's sort of one piece of feedback.
[1987.40 → 1989.18] It charges via USB-C.
[1990.92 → 1992.42] So this is pretty cool.
[1993.00 → 1994.28] You can adjust the volume.
[1994.28 → 1997.66] But like its end is USB-C or the other end is USB-C?
[1998.16 → 2000.64] Its end is USB-C for charging inside it.
[2000.64 → 2000.76] Okay.
[2000.78 → 2003.36] And then it terminates in some other connection on the other end, right?
[2003.36 → 2003.46] Yeah.
[2003.64 → 2004.16] USB-A.
[2004.24 → 2004.36] Yeah.
[2004.56 → 2004.90] Okay, good.
[2004.96 → 2005.06] Yeah.
[2005.40 → 2005.58] Yeah.
[2005.66 → 2005.98] All good.
[2006.06 → 2006.38] All good.
[2006.44 → 2006.76] All fine.
[2007.48 → 2012.02] So you can adjust the volume with like a touchpad thing or gestures or something, I think,
[2012.08 → 2012.44] like that.
[2012.84 → 2013.28] Gestures.
[2013.66 → 2013.96] Yeah.
[2015.10 → 2015.80] Here we go.
[2016.12 → 2020.56] So you can assign one of several abilities to the top or bottom buttons.
[2020.74 → 2021.58] You can fast-forward.
[2021.76 → 2022.52] You can blank the screen.
[2022.66 → 2023.24] You can scroll.
[2023.24 → 2025.32] You can set it for a custom keystroke.
[2025.44 → 2030.78] So some of the Logitech G, you know, programmable nonsense makes its way into it.
[2031.14 → 2032.46] I thought this was pretty cool.
[2032.60 → 2035.58] You can move a cursor around, and you can zoom in on your cursor point.
[2036.86 → 2037.22] Okay.
[2037.30 → 2038.24] Like with a little, like the spotlight.
[2038.52 → 2038.68] Yeah.
[2038.82 → 2039.08] Okay.
[2039.10 → 2040.10] So you can have a little spotlight.
[2041.42 → 2042.80] And it feels perfect in the hand.
[2042.88 → 2047.60] It comes in matte colours and is available exclusively on Logitech.com and through the Apple Store for
[2047.60 → 2048.06] the first month.
[2048.40 → 2049.44] You said something about gestures?
[2050.24 → 2051.42] Yeah, I think there are gestures.
[2051.42 → 2054.42] Um, maybe I'm wrong about that.
[2054.44 → 2055.94] I don't see anything about gestures in this article.
[2056.22 → 2056.80] I don't know.
[2056.86 → 2060.28] It's a presentation remote, and it's like 130 bucks or something like that.
[2061.00 → 2063.02] Um, it feels perfect in the hand though.
[2063.04 → 2063.34] It's metal.
[2063.34 → 2068.56] So if you're like a baller business dude, and you're like, I want the best presentation
[2068.56 → 2068.92] remote.
[2069.20 → 2069.42] Yes.
[2070.66 → 2071.80] Then you would buy one of these.
[2071.98 → 2072.14] Yeah.
[2072.28 → 2072.66] All right.
[2072.78 → 2073.68] So that's cool, I guess.
[2073.86 → 2074.06] Yeah.
[2075.08 → 2075.78] Oh man.
[2076.04 → 2078.20] This is kind of a been a painful week.
[2078.74 → 2079.00] Um.
[2079.00 → 2084.96] I noticed how like every, like if you're on like a product, I'm not going to be able to relate
[2084.96 → 2088.24] to a ton of people right now, but if you're on like a product conference call.
[2088.48 → 2088.78] Yeah.
[2088.94 → 2090.82] And they're trying to like to explain things to you.
[2092.16 → 2095.20] Have you noticed like the quality is often terrible?
[2097.60 → 2097.98] Hmm.
[2098.24 → 2098.56] No.
[2099.30 → 2101.78] And like, I don't think that it's the mics.
[2102.46 → 2102.74] Hmm.
[2102.80 → 2106.36] I don't necessarily think it's the webcams, but the webcams are often terrible too.
[2106.44 → 2108.76] And like the screen sharing software is often garbage.
[2109.52 → 2111.02] I've had pretty good experiences.
[2111.30 → 2111.88] Um, yeah.
[2111.94 → 2114.98] Logitech did the one through, uh, but Logitech makes this stuff.
[2115.04 → 2117.68] So they probably use their own really high-end things, and they're probably great.
[2117.78 → 2121.72] I'm talking like when it's not companies that make presentation things.
[2122.28 → 2122.96] Ah, yeah.
[2122.96 → 2123.66] Well, no, no.
[2123.72 → 2127.92] Logitech doesn't have their own, um, like their own, like you're talking like GoToMeeting or
[2127.92 → 2128.26] like.
[2128.56 → 2130.04] WebEx and all that kind of stuff.
[2130.28 → 2130.40] Yeah.
[2130.44 → 2132.84] Logitech was using one that I actually don't think I've used before.
[2132.86 → 2133.48] It was pretty good.
[2133.60 → 2135.44] My last couple of GoToMeeting's have been pretty good.
[2135.62 → 2139.52] I've had a lot of WebEx ones that were just sort of terrible.
[2139.82 → 2141.66] It could be the like way it's set up or something.
[2142.00 → 2144.20] Connecting to them seems really clunky too.
[2144.96 → 2145.58] I don't know, man.
[2145.60 → 2148.06] You'd think this kind of stuff would be very simple by now.
[2148.26 → 2149.32] That's what, yeah.
[2149.32 → 2153.44] I remember seeing a demo at, I think it was like, it was some developer conference or some
[2153.44 → 2154.16] kind of show.
[2154.16 → 2160.50] And the demo was like this, it was this social like video sharing application.
[2160.50 → 2166.38] And the idea was that it was kind of like chat rooms, and you could have like dozens
[2166.38 → 2169.90] of users all represented by like little tiny bubbles.
[2170.78 → 2172.94] And you could like, did you see this too?
[2173.02 → 2174.18] I think I remember this.
[2174.32 → 2174.44] Yeah.
[2174.44 → 2176.86] And you could like to drag your bubble from one room into another.
[2176.86 → 2179.76] And then you were all just kind of like sitting there chatting, and you all just had your,
[2179.84 → 2180.76] your bubbles.
[2181.64 → 2186.66] And it was kind of like Skype, but I think the idea behind it was that you could share
[2186.66 → 2188.40] experiences through it as well.
[2188.48 → 2188.68] Yeah.
[2188.74 → 2192.40] So you could all watch a movie together, for example, which is probably why it never got
[2192.40 → 2195.26] off the ground because that has all kinds of like content protection.
[2195.50 → 2195.72] Yeah.
[2197.06 → 2197.46] Issues.
[2197.72 → 2203.24] I just like, the thing that drives me crazy is you, you hear about these, like, remember
[2203.24 → 2207.18] we met that dude, I have to be super vague here.
[2207.46 → 2212.74] And he was the engineer who was making the crazy stuff that he was, we weren't allowed
[2212.74 → 2213.44] to talk about it.
[2213.84 → 2215.60] And he wasn't allowed to talk about it too much.
[2215.64 → 2216.10] Oh, in the airport?
[2216.28 → 2216.48] Yes.
[2216.54 → 2216.74] Yes.
[2217.12 → 2220.06] I was going to try to leave the airport out just to even try to make it more vague.
[2220.08 → 2220.24] Yeah.
[2220.32 → 2220.48] Yeah.
[2220.50 → 2221.54] But that's as far as I'm going to go there.
[2221.70 → 2223.82] Like they're making crazy stuff.
[2224.02 → 2224.18] Yeah.
[2224.18 → 2225.42] And some of this stuff already exists.
[2225.56 → 2231.16] I've been into conference rooms where I'm like, wow, the hardware you guys have to broadcast
[2231.16 → 2233.46] to people that aren't in this room is amazing.
[2233.72 → 2233.92] Yeah.
[2234.06 → 2236.74] And then I get on some of these calls, and we're just like, it sounds like crap.
[2236.84 → 2237.72] It looks like crap.
[2237.80 → 2238.00] Yeah.
[2238.08 → 2239.14] What's going on?
[2239.34 → 2241.56] This can't be the hardware that's in these rooms.
[2241.88 → 2242.04] Yeah.
[2242.06 → 2244.78] I mean, you look at like the way that's, okay.
[2244.86 → 2247.18] So like a wireless access point beam.
[2247.18 → 2249.40] I haven't had a conference call with Watch tack.
[2249.54 → 2249.74] Yeah.
[2249.84 → 2250.26] I can't.
[2250.38 → 2252.06] Wireless access point beam forming.
[2252.50 → 2253.20] That's a thing.
[2253.20 → 2260.32] So that's where you have an array of antennas that pick up where the clients are effectively
[2260.32 → 2263.90] and make sure that the signal strength is as good as it could possibly be.
[2264.28 → 2269.90] So I think like our Ruckus R710 has something like, I don't remember how many it is.
[2269.96 → 2271.20] It's like 40 antennas.
[2271.44 → 2271.84] Okay.
[2271.96 → 2272.44] It's not that.
[2272.64 → 2273.60] I don't remember how many it is.
[2273.70 → 2273.98] It's crazy.
[2274.00 → 2274.60] But it has lots.
[2274.66 → 2275.36] Lots of antennas.
[2275.48 → 2278.94] And it uses this beam forming in order to have better signal strength.
[2279.04 → 2281.94] And this type of beam forming also exists for audio.
[2281.94 → 2289.12] So that's how something like noise cancellation on a pair of wireless headphones works where
[2289.12 → 2293.90] it'll go, okay, this one and this one are working together to pick up your voice.
[2294.02 → 2298.94] And then this Omni one over here is trying to find anything that's not your voice.
[2298.94 → 2305.68] And they'll be able to cancel out anything that isn't you algorithmically using multiple
[2305.68 → 2306.16] microphones.
[2306.42 → 2309.68] And so there is crazy stuff that exists.
[2310.50 → 2310.66] Wow.
[2310.66 → 2316.54] But it's either very, very expensive or not even possible to buy unless you like call
[2316.54 → 2320.22] up a solutions engineer from one of these companies and go, do you guys have anything
[2320.22 → 2320.86] like this?
[2320.88 → 2321.60] And they go, yeah, sure.
[2321.64 → 2323.92] We'll have someone in the lab like hand make it for you.
[2324.38 → 2324.62] Yeah.
[2325.44 → 2325.88] Yeah.
[2325.88 → 2330.10] I mean, a perfect example of something like that was Sony's laser projector that they
[2330.10 → 2331.76] showed off a couple of years ago at CES.
[2331.76 → 2334.12] Where that was kind of like this in between.
[2334.64 → 2339.78] It was in between having a SKU that goes in a box with a part number that sits on a shelf
[2339.78 → 2340.54] at Best Buy.
[2340.54 → 2346.42] And you're having to like call Sony and have them build something custom because they did create
[2346.42 → 2349.44] a SKU, but you had to like call them and special order it.
[2349.44 → 2349.62] Yeah.
[2350.02 → 2353.08] And they would hand make them one at a time in Japan and ship it to you.
[2353.74 → 2355.78] So there's this gamut.
[2356.00 → 2360.38] There's this spectrum of like go to market strategies.
[2360.76 → 2360.88] Yeah.
[2360.88 → 2364.66] Speaking of go to market strategies, one of the best ways to go to market is to advertise
[2364.66 → 2365.52] on the WAN show.
[2366.56 → 2368.00] Just like FreshBooks does.
[2368.28 → 2368.36] Yeah.

[2385.80 → 2391.58] So you can spend time working on your business rather than just doing accounting junk.

[2436.68 → 2437.56] Oh, this is interesting.
[2438.34 → 2439.52] I, uh, what?
[2440.96 → 2443.32] Yeah, because you're a total scruff today.
[2443.32 → 2444.28] Okay.
[2444.66 → 2447.44] I explained this in the intro of my personal rig video.
[2447.62 → 2452.70] It has taken so long to get my personal rig video done that I decided on the first day
[2452.70 → 2456.62] that I started working on it, actually, that I wasn't going to shave or get a haircut until
[2456.62 → 2457.10] I was done.
[2457.52 → 2461.24] And then it ended up being, like, a really long time.
[2461.54 → 2464.84] You don't even look like, you don't even look like Playoff Beard.
[2465.30 → 2467.52] You just look like kind of unkempt.
[2467.52 → 2468.64] It's terrible.
[2468.78 → 2472.08] So, like, it goes pretty far down, which is rough.
[2472.14 → 2475.02] I get this stupid bald patch thingy here, which is rough.
[2475.40 → 2476.34] Well, it's not actually bald.
[2476.46 → 2479.00] Someone mentioned before that I might have, like, something wrong.
[2479.08 → 2480.34] It's some weird disease thing.
[2480.42 → 2481.24] No, there's hair there.
[2481.28 → 2481.74] It's just thinner.
[2482.34 → 2488.92] And then, like, all of this, like, if I flare it out, oh, that legitimately goes to, like,
[2488.96 → 2489.72] here on my hand.
[2489.76 → 2490.36] That's awful.
[2490.36 → 2491.50] It's, yeah.
[2491.60 → 2491.94] Okay.
[2492.20 → 2494.32] So, don't look like Luke.
[2494.44 → 2500.72] What I was going to add is every single time that we do a Dollar Shave Club ad, I haven't
[2500.72 → 2504.36] shaved in an extended period of time, and I don't know why that keeps happening.
[2504.86 → 2507.38] They're going to cut us off.
[2507.44 → 2507.98] Hopefully not.
[2508.02 → 2508.66] At some point.
[2508.76 → 2512.36] See, but the thing is, when they're not doing advertisements for us, I am clean-shaven.
[2512.60 → 2516.94] So, it's kind of like them being like, hey, you should fix this.
[2517.04 → 2517.34] Okay.
[2517.50 → 2518.82] So, don't look like him.
[2518.82 → 2520.12] We're a before and after photo.
[2520.12 → 2522.44] Join Dollar Shave Club.
[2522.64 → 2529.64] Dollar Shave Club lets you have a nice, clean shave with a fresh razor anytime you want.
[2529.70 → 2535.24] Because instead of having to, you know, go out and get someone to unlock the stupid thing
[2535.24 → 2537.02] and then get to the checkout.
[2537.04 → 2537.56] So difficult.
[2537.66 → 2544.94] Only to realize that you're paying an incredible amount of money for what is effectively, like,
[2544.94 → 2553.28] little strips of steel mounted in plastic with, like, different plastic that keeps you from slicing your fingers open on it while you're opening it.

[2568.24 → 2568.94] Start shaving.
[2570.46 → 2571.38] Start shaving.
[2572.34 → 2573.56] That's the difficult part.
[2573.66 → 2574.34] Finish shaving.
[2574.50 → 2578.62] You know, when they deliver it to your door, the only remaining difficult part is starting to shave.
[2578.66 → 2579.36] Starting to shave.
[2579.36 → 2585.04] And then you can look like you leave the house without actually leaving the house.

[2610.22 → 2611.48] That's just all I should say.
[2611.86 → 2614.86] Because everything else about it is kind of like autopilot.
[2614.90 → 2616.40] It's kind of extrapolating.
[2616.76 → 2617.68] You pick a template.
[2617.94 → 2618.12] Yeah.
[2618.26 → 2619.42] They handle all the hosting.
[2619.62 → 2621.02] It starts at 12 bucks a month.
[2621.14 → 2621.34] Yep.

[2628.28 → 2631.68] You can make changes anytime you want through their web GUI.
[2632.16 → 2632.68] This will work.
[2633.00 → 2636.40] You can publish an Apple News format to your Squarespace blog module.
[2636.52 → 2636.98] That'll work, too.
[2637.32 → 2637.90] You can...
[2637.90 → 2642.78] I'm trying to convince them to change their slogan to It Just Works.
[2642.94 → 2643.52] To It Just Works.
[2643.66 → 2643.86] Squarespace.
[2644.16 → 2644.70] It just works.
[2644.74 → 2645.78] I think that's...
[2645.78 → 2647.70] Isn't that like Apple's old slogan?
[2647.78 → 2648.84] I don't think they can do that.
[2648.84 → 2649.02] Is it?
[2649.56 → 2649.96] Yeah.
[2650.10 → 2651.02] Isn't that like Apple?
[2651.08 → 2651.66] It just works?
[2651.66 → 2653.34] It just works.
[2653.34 → 2653.38] It just works.
[2653.38 → 2654.38] It just works.
[2654.38 → 2655.10] It just works.
[2655.76 → 2656.68] Todd Howard.
[2657.62 → 2659.78] Todd Howard at E3.
[2660.82 → 2661.16] What?
[2661.36 → 2663.22] Where did It Just Works meme originate?
[2663.28 → 2663.88] Out of the loop Reddit.
[2664.00 → 2664.46] Check that out.
[2664.50 → 2671.84] In the meantime, Squarespace is all about taking the hassle out of having your own website.
[2671.84 → 2676.96] Whether you're running a little league team in your town or whether you have a restaurant
[2676.96 → 2680.74] or whether you resell Squarespace service.
[2681.14 → 2683.34] That is something that people totally do.
[2683.34 → 2686.12] Is they just set people up with Squarespace sites.
[2686.48 → 2688.70] They make them look really beautiful for them.
[2688.74 → 2689.76] And then they hand over the keys.
[2689.82 → 2690.48] And they go, boom.
[2690.54 → 2691.06] Here's your website.
[2691.14 → 2691.54] It's awesome.
[2691.82 → 2693.46] It only costs you a few bucks a month to maintain.
[2693.60 → 2694.12] Hi, Shane.
[2696.12 → 2697.58] Friend Shane literally does that.
[2699.76 → 2701.36] Or has done that, I guess.
[2701.72 → 2703.52] Well, you end up with a good website.
[2703.52 → 2709.86] And from a person who's designing websites perspective, there's no hassle after the fact.
[2709.94 → 2711.62] Someone like, okay, this is a legit story.
[2711.74 → 2713.32] I might screw up one or two small parts of it.
[2713.38 → 2715.52] But the general framing of the story is legit.
[2716.06 → 2716.74] Buddy Shane.
[2717.16 → 2718.00] Person comes up to them.
[2718.10 → 2719.70] Has spent tons of money on a web designer.
[2720.08 → 2720.98] Wasn't going well.
[2721.24 → 2722.08] He's like, hear, hear.
[2722.22 → 2723.60] Give me your credit card.
[2724.24 → 2725.14] Get some on Squarespace.
[2725.36 → 2726.04] Which one do you like?
[2726.08 → 2726.48] That one.
[2726.64 → 2726.86] Click.
[2727.70 → 2728.44] Fill in your stuff.
[2728.82 → 2729.58] Okay, you're done.
[2730.02 → 2730.84] That's all you needed.
[2731.64 → 2732.40] Everything's fine.
[2732.40 → 2735.28] They spent a lot of money on a web designer.
[2735.82 → 2737.60] And then they were way happier with their...
[2737.60 → 2738.46] This is like an actual...
[2738.46 → 2740.90] I'm leaving some details out because I don't know the exact amount of money.
[2741.22 → 2741.44] Right.
[2741.52 → 2743.12] I don't know how long they were struggling with it.
[2743.20 → 2743.56] I don't...
[2743.56 → 2744.20] There's like a...
[2744.20 → 2746.02] It's a much more interesting story when you know all the details.
[2746.14 → 2747.32] But that did happen.
[2747.50 → 2748.66] Something along those lines did happen.
[2748.86 → 2749.38] Yeah, dog.
[2750.34 → 2751.02] All right.
[2751.30 → 2753.02] So, on to the rest of the news.
[2753.10 → 2755.26] We actually do have a lot more topics than I thought.
[2755.38 → 2758.50] I wonder if Colton's been adding them since we started streaming.
[2758.72 → 2760.98] Because there's like pages and pages now.
[2760.98 → 2766.92] So, Time Warner apparently cheated customers on internet speed, says the New York Attorney General.
[2767.04 → 2768.80] I'm assuming that's what AG stands for.
[2768.80 → 2772.72] So, the original article here is from the PressHerald.com.
[2773.40 → 2780.54] Subscribers to the company's premium plan received internet speed as much as 70% slower than guaranteed in their ads, the lawsuit says.
[2780.54 → 2789.04] Now, I think it's been a long time since an ISP has actually guaranteed a speed in their ads.
[2789.46 → 2795.12] Everyone in Canada just says up to so that they don't end up getting sued over this stuff.
[2795.96 → 2801.52] But so, Charter acquired Time Warner Cable last year for $55 billion.
[2801.52 → 2803.42] I didn't realize they renamed it Spectrum.
[2804.26 → 2813.64] The suit was filed on Wednesday following a 16-month probe that included reviewing internal corporate communications and hundreds of thousands of subscriber speed tests.
[2814.30 → 2820.76] The investigation found that Spectrum Time Warner subscribers were getting dramatically shortchanged on both speed and reliability.
[2820.76 → 2828.56] Justin Bench, a spokesman, I don't know how to pronounce that last name, for Charter, said the company is disappointed with the decision to sue
[2828.56 → 2833.54] because it was based on service promises advertised before the company acquired Time Warner Cable.
[2835.00 → 2835.60] Okay.
[2836.46 → 2836.94] Well.
[2837.30 → 2837.90] So?
[2838.32 → 2839.46] So, then.
[2840.46 → 2841.38] Man up.
[2841.84 → 2842.18] Yeah.
[2842.18 → 2843.20] Okay.
[2843.84 → 2848.48] Noctua releases three CPU coolers specifically for AMD Ryzen.
[2849.02 → 2858.16] This is a perfect, perfect sign for reasons that might not be immediately apparent.
[2858.60 → 2860.66] So, they've got the NHL 12.
[2860.66 → 2866.28] So, first, this tells us something about Ry zen, and that is that there will be SKUs available
[2866.28 → 2874.30] that will be power and thermally efficient enough to use a low-profile cooler like this.
[2874.68 → 2874.86] Sorry?
[2875.14 → 2876.04] And hockey sticks?
[2876.50 → 2877.38] What about hockey sticks?
[2877.56 → 2878.04] NHL.
[2879.24 → 2879.68] Oh.
[2880.00 → 2880.88] Thank you for that.
[2880.94 → 2881.38] I tried.
[2881.58 → 2881.94] You did.
[2881.96 → 2882.76] We didn't make it there.
[2882.76 → 2883.12] Yeah.
[2883.72 → 2884.08] I...
[2884.08 → 2884.88] I...
[2884.88 → 2885.52] You know what?
[2885.72 → 2886.78] I'll take the blame for that one.
[2886.78 → 2887.46] I appreciate it.
[2887.54 → 2888.62] It's okay, but I appreciate it.
[2888.86 → 2892.76] I mean, if it was 2012, and you'd been like NHL 12...
[2893.76 → 2894.48] It would have been...
[2894.48 → 2895.82] Wouldn't have gotten any better, actually.
[2895.82 → 2896.18] Probably not.
[2896.20 → 2896.58] It would have been terrible.
[2896.72 → 2896.86] Okay.
[2897.46 → 2898.10] So, anyway.
[2898.52 → 2899.46] So, it tells us that.
[2899.78 → 2901.40] They also have a high-performance cooler.
[2901.52 → 2905.90] They have a special edition NF-NHD15.
[2906.32 → 2908.36] So, this is the SEAM4.
[2908.86 → 2913.60] This is really cool because it tells us that the scuttlebutt within the industry, a lot
[2913.60 → 2918.04] of which doesn't make its way into the media because of NDAs, but it tells us that the
[2918.04 → 2923.24] scuttlebutt within the industry is that AMD is going to have a processor that is high-performance
[2923.24 → 2928.02] enough to justify putting a $100 cooler on top of it.
[2928.74 → 2929.02] Right?
[2929.22 → 2932.14] So, we're not getting, like, a $149.99.
[2932.60 → 2935.62] We priced it that way because that's all it competes with.
[2935.62 → 2940.22] I feel like you should make a video breaking down, like, the potential expectations of
[2940.22 → 2941.48] the results of these coolers.
[2942.48 → 2942.74] Hmm.
[2943.64 → 2945.58] It would be a very speculative video.
[2945.94 → 2946.64] I don't know, man.
[2946.64 → 2947.56] I would be interested.
[2947.98 → 2949.12] So, here's a look at it.
[2949.20 → 2949.68] Straw ball.
[2949.82 → 2956.62] The other thing this tells us, okay, the fact that there are three coolers tells us that
[2956.62 → 2962.46] Noctua is expecting high enough sales volume of AM4 processors.
[2962.60 → 2964.04] Again, industry scuttlebutt here.
[2964.60 → 2972.18] High enough sales volumes that one cooler company can have three dedicated SKUs for just this platform.
[2972.18 → 2977.32] Something that they haven't done for a long time for AMD processors.
[2977.84 → 2981.96] So, this is, like, indirectly great news.
[2982.66 → 2985.72] There have also been some Ry zen leaks.
[2987.50 → 2989.98] Apparently, they are not in the dock.
[2991.24 → 2993.46] Ry zen leak, Linus Tech Tips.
[2993.54 → 2996.08] But I was reading about it on the forum earlier this week.
[2996.84 → 2999.28] The Ry zen CPU lineup possibly leaked.
[2999.28 → 3001.62] So, we'll just pull up the no, we won't.
[3002.36 → 3002.76] Okay.
[3003.42 → 3005.16] So, we will go like this.
[3005.32 → 3006.24] Thanks for saving that.
[3006.30 → 3006.60] Okay.
[3008.66 → 3010.04] And check this out.
[3010.44 → 3014.02] So, this was originally posted over on WCCF Tech.
[3014.44 → 3018.08] So, take it with whatever your opinion of WCCF Tech is.
[3018.66 → 3023.12] But this, sourcekulowler.com.
[3023.26 → 3026.50] Lower has been known for leaking a lot of stuff in the past, actually.
[3026.50 → 3033.76] Apparently, we're going to get, like, a Radon-style R prefix.
[3034.50 → 3038.88] Then we're getting these completely indecipherable model names, apparently.
[3039.74 → 3040.36] Why R?
[3041.96 → 3044.32] Well, with the graphics cards, it was Radeon.
[3044.52 → 3044.84] Oh, Ry zen.
[3045.64 → 3046.20] Ugh.
[3048.36 → 3048.84] No.
[3049.22 → 3049.88] Yeah, I hate it, too.
[3049.88 → 3060.16] So, it looks like we're going to get 8-core 16-thread anywhere from 3 to 3.6 GHz with the intention of competing against the 7700K to 6900K.
[3060.24 → 3062.62] Now, this is a little confusing to me.
[3062.82 → 3069.48] Because if they're showing off 6900K competitors, which are, according to this chart, expected to be at the top end,
[3069.48 → 3074.90] that are running without AMD's clock speed boosting technology running,
[3075.32 → 3082.68] how is it that an 8-core 16-thread at only 600 MHz less would be competitive with a 7700?
[3083.64 → 3088.22] Because these two perform very similarly in non-heavily threaded workloads,
[3088.22 → 3093.00] and this gets creamed by this in heavily multithreaded workloads.
[3093.10 → 3095.88] So, this is going to be very interested in a while or so.
[3096.18 → 3098.02] I don't know when Ry zen's coming.
[3098.26 → 3098.46] Yeah.
[3098.82 → 3101.52] Have you seen that dude who bends a pin every day or whatever?
[3102.00 → 3102.50] On what?
[3102.64 → 3103.88] He has an older AMD processor.
[3104.02 → 3105.22] Do not remember which one it is.
[3105.84 → 3109.16] I guess it literally has to be older, because there aren't any other ones right now.
[3109.76 → 3116.16] And he bends a pin on it, I think, every single day that they don't announce the release date of Ry zen.
[3116.16 → 3116.76] Ry zen.
[3116.76 → 3119.96] Well, that'll give him, like, three years worth of pins to bend.
[3119.98 → 3123.14] Well, no, like, he's started, I think, since CES.
[3124.24 → 3125.34] So, like, he's been going...
[3125.34 → 3126.34] Just this CES?
[3126.44 → 3126.66] Yeah.
[3126.84 → 3129.36] Okay, yeah, that still gives him, like, three years of pins to bend.
[3129.42 → 3130.92] So, I think he'll make it.
[3131.00 → 3134.06] He's through, like, a row and a half or something of pins.
[3134.62 → 3134.98] Nice.
[3135.56 → 3139.02] Speaking of bending pins, would you guys like to see...
[3139.02 → 3139.98] I'm not going to do a straw poll.
[3140.08 → 3141.20] Just hit me up in Twitch chat.
[3141.20 → 3147.44] Would you guys like to see a guide on repairing LGA sockets?
[3147.44 → 3149.74] You're perfect at it, so I would like to see that guide.
[3149.98 → 3152.96] Because Luke brought me a socket that got...
[3152.96 → 3153.90] I thought it was screwed.
[3154.06 → 3155.54] ...that got wrecked.
[3155.68 → 3160.10] As far as I could tell, when looking at it, it was pretty much a done deal.
[3160.22 → 3162.28] I thought one of...
[3162.28 → 3164.06] There are a few areas where you could see damage.
[3164.70 → 3168.96] And I thought one of them in particular, I literally thought the pin was missing.
[3168.96 → 3172.62] So, I was like, I can't fix that.
[3172.68 → 3174.02] And when that's the case, you're done.
[3174.12 → 3174.30] Yeah.
[3174.52 → 3179.26] But I actually have a dead LGA 2011 3 board.
[3179.84 → 3181.20] It's really unfortunate.
[3181.40 → 3184.10] It's a WS board, which is like...
[3184.10 → 3185.66] So, it's like a $600 board.
[3185.80 → 3186.80] I got in touch with Asus.
[3186.88 → 3190.88] It would cost me, like, $350 to repair the socket.
[3191.40 → 3192.96] And I'm just like...
[3193.84 → 3195.46] Yeah.
[3195.46 → 3201.60] And it's still a used board with, like, a used socket soldered onto it now.
[3202.46 → 3204.12] Like, I don't...
[3204.12 → 3205.92] Maybe a new socket, but, like...
[3205.92 → 3207.06] I don't know.
[3207.64 → 3208.38] It sketched me out.
[3208.88 → 3213.16] But I could sacrifice what's left of it.
[3213.20 → 3213.60] Because you know what?
[3213.62 → 3215.66] It actually kind of still works, except that some...
[3215.66 → 3215.90] Okay.
[3216.12 → 3220.90] But, yeah, I think for this video to carry weight, it has to be a motherboard that will work when you're done.
[3222.84 → 3225.20] So, you have to go from, like, look, everything's in.
[3225.30 → 3226.52] It doesn't turn on properly.
[3227.10 → 3227.70] Take it out.
[3227.94 → 3229.12] Look how terrible it is.
[3229.50 → 3229.82] Fix.
[3230.22 → 3230.84] Boot it back up.
[3231.14 → 3231.84] This works.
[3232.28 → 3232.64] Okay.
[3233.08 → 3233.36] Okay.
[3233.36 → 3234.28] I don't know if I'm...
[3234.28 → 3237.60] Like, I don't know if everyone agrees with me, but I feel like that adds a lot more weight to the video.
[3237.60 → 3239.24] I wish we had done it on that board then.
[3239.38 → 3241.08] Because there were pins in the socket.
[3241.08 → 3245.54] I don't know if you guys have looked that closely at them, but basically, they stick up kind of like this.
[3245.66 → 3249.86] They're kind of flat, and then they go up, and then they come out, and then there's, like, a pad on the end.
[3249.94 → 3250.42] There's, like...
[3250.42 → 3252.08] It's more joints than my finger has, but...
[3252.74 → 3255.08] Basically, um...
[3255.80 → 3258.30] I can't believe you just did that.
[3258.36 → 3259.50] You're on camera, too.
[3262.48 → 3264.70] Anyway, it sticks up like this.
[3264.82 → 3266.68] These were bent all the way over.
[3267.40 → 3270.16] So, I had to bend them all the way back like this.
[3271.08 → 3272.08] Um...
[3272.08 → 3273.42] It was pretty impressive.
[3274.56 → 3276.00] I was, like...
[3276.00 → 3278.36] He's fixed a lot of crazy sockets before.
[3278.62 → 3279.40] It's working, though.
[3279.78 → 3280.32] It is working.
[3280.48 → 3281.16] It is completely working.
[3281.36 → 3283.14] So, maybe next time we have a...
[3283.14 → 3285.38] And we have a bent socket, we'll tackle it.
[3285.40 → 3291.88] Because the bent pin repair video that I did back on NCI Tech Tips was also done under similar circumstances.
[3291.88 → 3298.48] I was trying to get a video done, and the pin, well, broke off eventually.
[3298.92 → 3298.98] Yeah.
[3298.98 → 3299.98] Um...
[3299.98 → 3300.94] Have you watched that video?
[3301.08 → 3301.26] No.
[3301.42 → 3301.68] Okay.
[3302.06 → 3303.98] So, the pin was bent, and in trying to bend it back...
[3303.98 → 3305.10] I feel like you told me about this.
[3305.20 → 3306.06] ... I broke it off.
[3306.58 → 3309.84] That CPU is still running in my parents' desktop.
[3310.38 → 3311.16] It's still running.
[3311.24 → 3311.48] Anyway.
[3311.48 → 3312.48] Um...
[3312.48 → 3318.58] So, that video, we filmed it as an impromptu thing in the middle of a completely separate video that just happened to need that...
[3318.58 → 3320.28] I needed that processor for it.
[3320.28 → 3328.38] And the reason that I had to repair it, rather than go into the warehouse and grab another one, is we were filming after hours, and I couldn't go get another one.
[3328.38 → 3329.38] I had no choice.
[3329.38 → 3330.38] I had to fix it.
[3330.38 → 3331.38] So, maybe next time.
[3331.38 → 3332.38] Maybe next time.
[3332.38 → 3333.38] Maybe next time.
[3333.38 → 3334.38] We'll do that.
[3334.38 → 3335.38] Cool.
[3335.38 → 3339.38] I don't even remember what the news item that we were talking about was.
[3339.38 → 3340.38] Um...
[3340.38 → 3344.38] Oh, there is more Ry zen news this week, though, aside from the lineup being revealed.
[3344.38 → 3345.38] Um...
[3345.38 → 3346.38] And that lineup looks very promising.
[3346.38 → 3347.38] The fact that AMD...
[3347.38 → 3351.38] Because there are a lot of costs associated with bringing a SKU to market.
[3351.38 → 3357.38] Even just stupid stuff, like packaging and marketing and expecting distributors and retailers to stock all this stuff.
[3357.38 → 3363.38] They have to be expecting sales volume if they're going to have, like, what looked like 15 to 20 SKUs at launch.
[3364.38 → 3365.38] Um...
[3365.38 → 3366.38] More good news.
[3366.38 → 3370.38] AMD expected to provide Windows 7 drivers for their upcoming Ry zen CPUs.
[3370.38 → 3373.38] And you might think, oh, well, yeah, of course.
[3373.38 → 3386.38] But remember, a lot of the Windows 7 support for modern hardware comes from it having already, like, supported Windows 7 before.
[3386.38 → 3387.38] Um...
[3387.38 → 3390.38] Like, graphics cards, stuff like that, yeah, sure.
[3390.38 → 3392.38] But there's no real guarantee.
[3392.38 → 3399.38] Once it's on Microsoft's, like, end of support roadmap, there's no real guarantee that you're going to get proper support.
[3399.38 → 3402.38] Because Ry zen will probably work on Vista, too.
[3403.38 → 3405.38] But they might not guarantee it.
[3405.38 → 3411.38] So official support means that they're going to support it, and they're going to make sure that there are no bugs.
[3411.38 → 3413.38] Even though it might work on other stuff.
[3413.38 → 3415.38] So that's a very important distinction.
[3415.38 → 3417.38] And more good news about AMD Ryzen.
[3417.38 → 3420.38] We should just call this the good news about Ry zen show.
[3420.38 → 3426.38] You know how with Steam, you can stream games over a network?
[3426.38 → 3427.38] Yeah.
[3427.38 → 3430.38] There's, like, if you have it installed on another computer somewhere else, there's the stream button.
[3430.38 → 3431.38] Yeah.
[3431.38 → 3432.38] Right?
[3432.38 → 3435.38] What if you did it over the same computer using Unpaid?
[3435.38 → 3437.38] Um, that could be done.
[3437.38 → 3440.38] I can't think of a good reason to do it, though.
[3440.38 → 3442.38] Not wanting to use Windows.
[3442.38 → 3443.38] Oh.
[3443.38 → 3448.38] Like, not wanting to use Windows for your actual desktop experience.
[3448.38 → 3456.38] So could you pass through much of your, well, you wouldn't even need to pass through as many resources because Linux is just lighter.
[3456.38 → 3457.38] Yeah.
[3457.38 → 3461.38] So if you had, like, a 10 core extreme edition or something, and you passed through, like, four of your cores.
[3461.38 → 3471.38] Or you could even do six of your cores to your desktop experience, and you used four of them for a Windows gaming VM and you streamed off of that, yes, that could actually work quite well.
[3473.38 → 3475.38] I kind of want to do that.
[3475.38 → 3477.38] Windows 10 is really annoying.
[3477.38 → 3481.38] Like, oh, man, I sort of hate it.
[3481.38 → 3489.38] There was even a post on PCMR today, I think it hit the top, where the guy has, like, all notification settings and all advertisement and everything turned off everywhere.
[3489.38 → 3495.38] And Cortana, even though disabled, comes in the corner and is like, hey, have you figured out your Super Bowl snacks yet?
[3495.38 → 3498.38] Like, pissed off!
[3498.38 → 3501.38] I actually really hate using that operating system.
[3501.38 → 3506.38] And I would love to use Windows 7, but then we have topics like this where it's like, oh, yay, new hardware supports it.
[3506.38 → 3508.38] Instead of, like, of course, new hardware supports it.
[3508.38 → 3510.38] So here's an interesting little tidbit.
[3510.38 → 3516.38] I found a Windows 8.1 unused license key in the office today.
[3516.38 → 3518.38] And I had a thought.
[3518.38 → 3522.38] You know how we're having a lot of issues with stability with Adobe Media Encoder?
[3522.38 → 3527.38] I am going to try putting one of our render machines on Windows 8.1 and see what happens.
[3527.38 → 3529.38] My brother swears by it.
[3529.38 → 3532.38] He uses 8.1 and suggests it to everybody.
[3532.38 → 3535.38] It has a lot of the optimizations.
[3535.38 → 3538.38] Things like SMB multichannel optimizations.
[3538.38 → 3542.38] Things like the much better task manager and file transfer stuff.
[3542.38 → 3543.38] All of that stuff.
[3543.38 → 3545.38] Doesn't have DirectX 12 support.
[3545.38 → 3548.38] Who cares?
[3548.38 → 3551.38] But I want to try it out because one of the writer applicants...
[3551.38 → 3553.38] Like, it's okay, to be fair with who cares.
[3553.38 → 3556.38] Like, it's really stupid that it doesn't have that support.
[3556.38 → 3558.38] But it's not better, yet, at least.
[3558.38 → 3559.38] So don't worry about it.
[3559.38 → 3560.38] It's fine.
[3560.38 → 3567.38] So one of the writer applicants worked on a video that we probably won't end up releasing just because I wasn't there to oversee the testing methodology.
[3567.38 → 3569.38] We paid him for the work anyway.
[3569.38 → 3580.38] But, like, so he benchmarked Windows Vista 7, 8.1, and 10 to determine, is there truly an operating system that performs better?
[3580.38 → 3582.38] And Windows 8.1 came on top.
[3582.38 → 3583.38] Yeah.
[3583.38 → 3584.38] Like, consistently.
[3584.38 → 3585.38] Yeah.
[3585.38 → 3588.38] So I'm going to try it out, and I'm going to see how it goes.
[3588.38 → 3591.38] Like, yes, the start menu is garbage, but you can replace it.
[3591.38 → 3592.38] Yep.
[3592.38 → 3593.38] Cossack start?
[3593.38 → 3594.38] Yeah.
[3594.38 → 3595.38] Shell?
[3595.38 → 3596.38] Can't remember.
[3596.38 → 3597.38] I believe it's start.
[3597.38 → 3598.38] Yeah, it's been a while.
[3598.38 → 3599.38] Yeah.
[3599.38 → 3603.38] Firefox OS, speaking of operating systems, is dead.
[3603.38 → 3608.38] Mozilla kills off the open source Internet of Things project with 50 layoffs.
[3608.38 → 3611.38] And the original article is from Zone.
[3611.38 → 3614.38] There's not really a lot to add other than that.
[3614.38 → 3624.38] We have shifted our internal focus, our internal approach to the Internet of Things opportunity to step back from a focus on launching and scaling commercial products to one focused on research and advanced development.
[3624.38 → 3625.38] Okay.
[3625.38 → 3627.38] So basically, it's not there yet.
[3627.38 → 3630.38] So we'll, like, hire a team later.
[3630.38 → 3631.38] Yeah.
[3631.38 → 3632.38] Um.
[3632.38 → 3633.38] Yeah.
[3633.38 → 3638.38] The Nintendo online service will cost less than $30 a year, apparently.
[3638.38 → 3639.38] That's very reasonable.
[3639.38 → 3649.38] But, unlike PlayStation Network, PSN, and, like, other things, your monthly, like, random little game that you get, you don't get to keep it.
[3649.38 → 3656.38] So you essentially get, like, a random game for a month, and then it's gone.
[3656.38 → 3657.38] Okay.
[3657.38 → 3661.38] So you lose, like, a lot of the benefit and save half the money.
[3661.38 → 3668.38] So if you didn't care at all about the games that you would get included, I'm not going to say for free, included with the other services.
[3668.38 → 3669.38] Yeah.
[3669.38 → 3670.38] Um.
[3670.38 → 3672.38] Then this is better, because it's cheaper.
[3672.38 → 3682.38] But then I think a lot of the value proposition of this is going to be figured out when they actually roll it out, because they're new to the kind of party.
[3682.38 → 3683.38] Right.
[3683.38 → 3686.38] And their online services have been absolute trash.
[3686.38 → 3687.38] Yeah.
[3687.38 → 3690.38] So now that they're charging for it, they better step their game up.
[3690.38 → 3692.38] And I love how they just shut them down.
[3692.38 → 3695.38] Like, I really liked playing Mario Kart DS.
[3695.38 → 3699.38] And they're just like, pfft, peace.
[3699.38 → 3700.38] It's gone.
[3700.38 → 3703.38] And there's no, you know, community replacement option.
[3703.38 → 3709.38] Just, yep, that thing that you enjoyed about that thing you bought, maybe you should have played it more when it was still available, brush.
[3709.38 → 3710.38] Um, okay.
[3710.38 → 3712.38] Well, we'll see how that goes for them.
[3712.38 → 3713.38] Yeah.
[3713.38 → 3714.38] There's going to be a lot of, let's see how that goes for them.
[3714.38 → 3722.38] There's a lot of speculation that if Switch isn't, like, a resounding success, Nintendo's not going to do another living room console.
[3723.38 → 3725.38] Um, just move to the game.
[3725.38 → 3728.38] But then this is hard to even define as a living room console.
[3728.38 → 3729.38] There's been a lot of talk about that.
[3729.38 → 3731.38] It's, it's basically a hybrid.
[3731.38 → 3736.38] And like, honestly, wow, using it in handheld mode is amazing.
[3736.38 → 3739.38] And like, handheld mode and tabletop mode were the main interesting things.
[3739.38 → 3746.38] Honestly, when I was using the like TV mode experience, it was good, but it was just good.
[3746.38 → 3748.38] The handheld mode was awesome.
[3748.38 → 3751.38] It felt like the best version of a DS just because the screen is huge.
[3751.38 → 3755.38] And like, if you take the controllers off, it's actually pretty easy to pack somewhere.
[3755.38 → 3762.38] Um, certain games, like if you get Zelda, certain editions of Zelda, like the special editions and stuff, come with a sleeve.
[3762.38 → 3765.38] So you can take your Switch with you.
[3765.38 → 3768.38] Like, they're very much approaching it from a mobile standard.
[3768.38 → 3769.38] Cool.
[3769.38 → 3775.38] Uh, the original article here is from Ars Technica, posted by M. Suribachi or something like that on the forum.
[3775.38 → 3782.38] NVIDIA to stop people from reselling promotional game codes by tying the codes to hardware.
[3782.38 → 3787.38] So to be clear, uh, the game is not tied to that video card forever.
[3787.38 → 3791.38] So if you were to change your video card down the road, you still get to keep it.
[3791.38 → 3796.38] But redeeming the game permanently adds the game to the appropriate third party service.
[3796.38 → 3803.38] And they have confirmed that GeForce Experience will check that the user has installed a qualifying graphics card.
[3803.38 → 3805.38] But again, the game will not be permanently linked to the hardware.
[3805.38 → 3806.38] I get it.
[3806.38 → 3813.38] I'm not thrilled about it because I personally would often use like bundled games as sort of-
[3813.38 → 3815.38] To offset the cost of your card.
[3815.38 → 3816.38] Mm-hmm.
[3816.38 → 3821.38] Um, like when I already owned it, it's just kind of a bummer if I already bought it.
[3821.38 → 3825.38] Um, so yeah, that sucks.
[3825.38 → 3827.38] Uh, we've talked about that already.
[3827.38 → 3831.38] LG's 5K monitor, this was originally posted by Goodbyes,
[3831.38 → 3834.38] is not cooperating well with routers.
[3834.38 → 3840.38] And LG is recommending keeping your monitor at least 7 feet away from your router.
[3840.38 → 3842.38] Apparently, once the router-
[3842.38 → 3844.38] Oh, they don't have a picture of it happening or anything.
[3844.38 → 3847.38] But apparently, once the router gets too close,
[3847.38 → 3853.38] it causes interference with the display and causes it to, uh, not work properly.
[3853.38 → 3859.38] So, it can flicker, disconnect, or freeze the computer due to electromagnetic interference.
[3859.38 → 3862.38] LG has acknowledged the problem.
[3862.38 → 3868.38] Um, but they don't have anything specific that they're saying about what they plan to do to address it.
[3868.38 → 3872.38] I think that's pretty much it for today.
[3872.38 → 3873.38] Yep.
[3873.38 → 3874.38] That's it.
[3874.38 → 3877.38] Do you want to talk about the 58GB HD texture pack for Fallout 4 really quick?
[3877.38 → 3878.38] Sure.
[3878.38 → 3879.38] The-
[3879.38 → 3884.38] Okay, so basically what I just said, 58GB HD texture pack for Fallout 4.
[3884.38 → 3885.38] That's crazy.
[3885.38 → 3890.38] Uh, your PC will need to meet or exceed the recommended specs to run this pack.
[3890.38 → 3892.38] The recommended specs that they're talking about is Windows 7, 8, or 10.
[3892.38 → 3893.38] Wow.
[3893.38 → 3894.38] Look at that.
[3894.38 → 3897.38] An Intel Core i7 5820K or better.
[3897.38 → 3898.38] Holy shadow.
[3898.38 → 3901.38] A GTX 1080 8GB or better.
[3901.38 → 3904.38] And 8GB of RAM or better.
[3904.38 → 3905.38] Oh.
[3905.38 → 3907.38] That looks incredible though.
[3907.38 → 3908.38] Yeah.
[3908.38 → 3910.38] With your new personal rig, you'll be able to chew through that.
[3910.38 → 3911.38] And maybe stream it.
[3911.38 → 3912.38] Wicked.
[3912.38 → 3915.38] Alright, so thanks for tuning in to the WAN Show, guys.
[3915.38 → 3917.38] We will see you again next week.
[3917.38 → 3920.38] Same bat time, same bat channel.
[3920.38 → 3921.38] Yay.
[3925.38 → 3926.38] Oh, right.
[3926.38 → 3927.38] The outro.
[3927.38 → 3930.38] Well, the intro, but like with no- yeah, there's no audio.
[3930.38 → 3933.38] I could try and find the audio one.
[3935.38 → 3938.38] Um, I don't know where Ed put it.
[3938.38 → 3941.38] Did someone else bring in a foam roller or is this for filming?
[3941.38 → 3942.38] I have no idea.
[3942.38 → 3945.38] I just don't question things anymore.
[3945.38 → 3947.38] Uh, let's do the intro.
[3947.38 → 3951.38] Is there something that he modified today?
[3951.38 → 3952.38] Nope.
[3952.38 → 3954.38] I have no idea.
[3954.38 → 3955.38] Okay.
[3955.38 → 3956.38] And...
[3956.38 → 3957.38] And...
