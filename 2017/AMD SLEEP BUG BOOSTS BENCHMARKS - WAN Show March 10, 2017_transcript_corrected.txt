[0.00 → 1.22] And sync.
[1.78 → 3.46] We don't have to sync.
[3.72 → 4.20] Sync.
[4.54 → 7.34] The plan is never to sync, the plan is to float.
[8.60 → 11.60] That's right, alright, welcome to the WAN show you guys.
[12.28 → 13.06] Syncing for the editor.
[13.66 → 15.50] We don't edit the WAN show.
[15.70 → 16.06] Why not?
[16.50 → 17.18] Why not?
[17.24 → 21.46] Because the WAN show is already as great as it possibly could be.
[21.52 → 22.72] It is the greatest show.
[23.04 → 25.90] And we've got a lot of great topics for you guys today.
[26.16 → 27.90] So first up, Twitch.
[27.90 → 33.66] To relaunch Curse as social Twitch desktop app.
[34.32 → 35.04] So social.
[35.60 → 36.92] Sounds very social to me.
[37.24 → 39.44] It's a very interesting actual shift.
[39.58 → 41.22] I do have a fair bit to discuss that.
[41.26 → 44.78] Even though I have never once used Curse and very rarely use Twitch.
[46.02 → 49.04] Only once a week, but other than that.
[49.50 → 54.22] The first AM4 IT board appears.
[54.86 → 56.38] Dun dun dun.
[57.90 → 62.56] Facebook strikes a deal to live stream Major League Soccer matches.
[62.80 → 64.32] Which of course, sorry, excuse me, football.
[64.54 → 64.84] Football.
[65.20 → 65.44] Football.
[66.12 → 67.72] Not hand egg.
[67.92 → 68.46] It's not football.
[68.54 → 68.70] Yeah.
[68.96 → 69.90] It's not football.
[70.26 → 70.58] Really?
[70.66 → 76.60] Are you going to be that guy that just has to go and be, you know, all American about it?
[76.60 → 83.32] Well, when I was a kid, we called football the game with the ball with the pig skin on it.
[83.46 → 83.94] You know?
[83.94 → 92.10] Nintendo Switch sales are apparently absolutely crushingating everything.
[92.58 → 94.20] And let's see.
[94.24 → 94.38] Wow.
[94.42 → 95.60] There was another really cool one.
[95.80 → 96.20] Where is it?
[96.20 → 104.56] Scientists have stored a movie, an operating system, and an Amazon gift card in a single speck of DNA.
[104.56 → 107.60] So we'll have more on this at 11.
[108.04 → 109.64] So far we have zero viewers, apparently.
[109.72 → 110.48] That must be an error.
[111.42 → 114.22] I refuse to accept that we could have zero viewers on the Wanker.
[114.22 → 115.42] There are Twitch chatters.
[115.56 → 116.54] There are Twitch chatters.
[116.54 → 118.22] I have 601 viewers.
[118.46 → 118.96] All right.
[119.04 → 119.60] Rock on.
[119.68 → 122.14] So those 601 viewers can watch an intro that works.
[122.14 → 125.16] So, oh, oh, and I, no, no, I got this.
[125.50 → 126.38] Mute, mute, mute.
[126.48 → 127.20] Everything is fine.
[127.32 → 127.98] Everything is awesome.
[128.10 → 128.48] Good stuff.
[129.28 → 129.72] Good stuff.
[130.46 → 131.48] This is going well.
[133.92 → 134.94] Going as expected.
[136.16 → 136.94] Do you have music?
[137.78 → 138.86] I believe so.
[139.94 → 140.76] I'm busy.
[141.18 → 142.48] I'm on a new laptop.
[147.48 → 148.46] No, no, I got this.
[148.56 → 149.48] I got this.
[149.56 → 149.86] Don't worry.
[150.04 → 150.60] I got this.
[150.66 → 151.10] I got this.
[151.18 → 151.68] I'm trying to help.
[151.68 → 152.34] I fix it.
[152.74 → 153.92] I fix it now.
[154.20 → 154.88] I fix it.
[154.88 → 155.88] Not you fix it.
[155.98 → 156.44] I fix it.
[156.46 → 157.06] I fix it.
[159.06 → 160.46] I got nothing for that one.
[163.16 → 164.32] My space.
[164.96 → 165.64] My space.
[165.76 → 165.84] No.
[166.64 → 167.42] It's in a square.
[167.88 → 168.06] No.
[168.42 → 169.02] It's a square.
[169.40 → 170.92] My space is a square.
[171.02 → 171.16] Nope.
[171.16 → 171.22] Nope.
[171.22 → 171.52] Terrible.
[172.22 → 172.62] Terrible.
[172.76 → 173.74] Everything about it is terrible.
[174.82 → 175.40] All right.
[175.42 → 181.22] I got to get logged into Twitch here, which is such an ordeal the way that we have it set
[181.22 → 186.48] up because, you know, okay, I can't give any details because it has a lot to do with the
[186.48 → 187.94] way that we have our account secured.
[188.08 → 189.32] But let me put it this way.
[189.66 → 190.34] It's not easy.
[190.46 → 194.04] It is not easy to lock into our Twitch account.
[194.04 → 195.64] Are we doing the first topic first?
[196.34 → 197.28] Is that what's happening?
[197.28 → 197.72] Yeah.
[197.78 → 199.04] Why don't we do the first topic first?
[199.14 → 201.96] We've got a lot of actually perfect topics for you guys today.
[202.56 → 206.36] First up is going to be, ah, yes.
[207.00 → 210.60] Twitch to relaunch Curse as Social Twitch Desktop App.
[210.94 → 214.52] So this is, the original article here is from The Verge.
[214.72 → 222.28] And as someone who hasn't, due to having children and whatnot, who hasn't had a ton of time for
[222.28 → 224.72] gaming in the last five years.
[224.84 → 225.28] Wow.
[225.72 → 226.70] Yeah, I know.
[226.92 → 227.32] I know.
[227.40 → 232.00] I'm basically an old man at this point, except that old people, you get old enough that you
[232.00 → 233.90] actually could have time for gaming again.
[234.56 → 235.00] 30.
[235.92 → 236.78] No balls.
[237.78 → 238.40] Three kids.
[238.60 → 239.48] I have balls.
[239.56 → 240.18] They just don't work.
[241.16 → 242.72] Hashtag no balls in the chat, please.
[244.72 → 245.16] Okay.
[245.24 → 247.16] You know that the chatbot will ban them, right?
[248.88 → 249.68] That's the plan.
[249.68 → 251.38] If it turns into a spam test.
[251.38 → 255.86] Yeah, so anyone who listens to Nick ends up banned.
[257.86 → 258.76] So, okay.
[258.92 → 266.16] So tell me then, as someone who may have actually looked at the Curse app at some point or another.
[266.28 → 266.80] Yeah, what's up?
[267.46 → 268.32] What is it?
[268.76 → 269.92] Why would anyone care?
[269.98 → 274.14] Because it's been installed as what I perceived as junkware on my stuff.
[274.30 → 278.94] To be honest with you, Curse was like kind of after my time as well.
[278.94 → 281.98] Which is really sad because now I'm an old person too.
[283.26 → 289.68] But yeah, I think it was mainly just like a chat app that had some type of integration with some games.
[291.10 → 293.92] So it was Steam, but like not Steam?
[294.36 → 298.86] Yeah, I think it was meant to be like a voice and text chat service essentially.
[298.86 → 299.96] I might be wrong.
[300.90 → 302.86] But that was my understanding.
[303.30 → 305.74] So it's Discord, but older and not Discord?
[307.34 → 308.72] I think so.
[308.88 → 310.14] So anyway, the new...
[310.14 → 312.54] I mean, Twitch chat, let us know if we're wrong here.
[312.78 → 313.80] Because here's...
[313.80 → 316.76] Okay, so here's my problems right off the bat.
[316.76 → 319.20] Is that there are...
[320.30 → 321.92] It's like an overflow.
[322.48 → 328.62] There are so many ways for gamers to communicate with each other while they're gaming.
[329.06 → 332.60] There's the voice and text chat that's built into the game.
[333.08 → 339.26] There's the one that's built into your overlay through whatever online platform you purchased your game through.
[339.44 → 343.30] If you're a smart person who purchases their games through an online platform.
[343.82 → 344.50] So there's that.
[344.50 → 347.60] Then there's centralized services.
[347.76 → 351.52] Lots of people still use Skype, but there are ones like Discord, for example.
[352.16 → 356.44] Then there's self-hosted solutions like Mumble, Ventral.
[357.76 → 360.92] I mean, do we need one run by Twitch?
[361.30 → 362.24] I don't think so.
[362.46 → 364.52] Okay, people in the chat are saying, no, you're wrong.
[364.68 → 366.44] Curse is a mod platform for WoW.
[366.98 → 370.86] Yeah, like 10 years ago, Curse was a big mod platform for WoW.
[370.86 → 379.66] What we're talking about is Curse Voice, which was what is being translated into Twitch's desktop app here is what my assumption is.
[380.52 → 384.02] So, yes, Curse used to be a mod platform for WoW.
[384.30 → 387.18] As far as I know, it hasn't been that mainly in a number of years.
[387.18 → 392.12] But, yeah, I really don't understand why this needs to be a thing.
[392.48 → 396.22] Like, Discord is pretty much the easiest thing to use that I've found.
[397.08 → 399.80] But there are tons of self-hosted stuff.
[400.22 → 406.12] There is, you know, even like going back to the old days of Skype when Skype used to be used for gaming.
[406.12 → 415.48] I really don't understand what the kind of, like, value that's being added here is.
[416.64 → 427.88] And here's something that's hilarious to me is, like, it feels like everyone else wants to move things to mobile and move things to web apps.
[427.88 → 430.36] And here it is, a desktop app.
[430.42 → 438.78] Now, with that said, as someone who does genuinely prefer having a desktop app, like Google Hangouts, which, by the way, this is hilarious.
[439.48 → 445.84] Google is rebranding their, yes, their messaging service again.
[447.60 → 449.02] So, yeah, we'll talk more about that later.
[449.82 → 456.66] I would love it if, that's one of my main issues with Google Hangouts is that there isn't, like, a first-party Google Hangouts desktop application.
[456.66 → 459.82] And that it has to run in my browser in a Gmail tab.
[460.18 → 462.44] Or I can pop it out, and could, like, have it all over the place.
[462.50 → 463.46] But it's very disorganized.
[463.74 → 465.92] I would prefer if it was just a desktop app.
[466.14 → 473.62] I just don't really see why, for gamers, it is considered a boon to have more crap running in the background.
[474.02 → 481.68] So, the app's going to include community servers, screen sharing, which, like, why not just use a business platform if you're going to be screen sharing?
[481.80 → 483.56] Why would you need to screen share when you're gaming?
[483.56 → 490.42] Voice and video messaging and game content distribution.
[491.30 → 494.90] So, same thing, like, you could get mods or whatever else on it, I guess.
[494.98 → 498.22] It's meant to give streamers, followers a place to connect.
[498.40 → 499.70] But doesn't Discord already do that?
[500.90 → 504.22] And keep people, okay, so here, finally, we get to the meat and potatoes of it.
[504.28 → 507.94] And keep people on the site after game streams have ended.
[507.94 → 512.50] With features like communities, Twitch Creative, and Twitch Presents.
[513.02 → 519.54] So, as far as I can tell, they pretty much went like, hey, lots of streamers are using Discord to manage their communities.
[520.82 → 524.30] Why don't we just, like, phase them out?
[525.58 → 525.92] Okay.
[526.50 → 528.66] I mean, I guess, okay, well, now the strategy is clear.
[528.80 → 530.02] At least we've got that sorted out.
[530.02 → 530.50] Yeah.
[532.36 → 535.12] So, I guess that's what it is.
[535.18 → 535.32] Yeah.
[535.42 → 537.20] So, the launch is on March 16th.
[537.22 → 540.46] And existing Curse users will be upgraded to the new version.
[540.84 → 541.58] Just like that.
[541.86 → 542.24] Enjoy.
[543.08 → 545.48] It's kind of a funny thing.
[545.64 → 550.86] Like, do you feel a little bit like a baseball player?
[551.44 → 553.42] Where you just kind of get, we're getting traded.
[553.42 → 554.12] You know?
[554.54 → 558.62] Like, when one company that you've kind of, you've got your loyalty to.
[558.68 → 560.24] Yeah, does anyone still use Razor Come?
[560.60 → 561.40] Speaking of.
[562.50 → 563.70] Is Razor Come still a thing?
[564.06 → 564.66] Oh, yeah.
[564.90 → 566.52] Or is it part of, like, Synapse now?
[567.12 → 567.40] No.
[567.74 → 569.34] Razor Come is a thing.
[570.10 → 570.84] Razor Come.
[570.86 → 571.26] Look at this.
[571.32 → 573.12] You can see, you can tell something's a thing.
[573.28 → 577.32] When it doesn't just have, like, the top line here.
[577.38 → 579.88] When it has, like, lots of other crap under it that's important.
[579.96 → 582.80] Mind you, some of this is Razor Come lol scouter.
[582.80 → 584.22] Okay, I don't know what that is.
[584.42 → 585.84] But mobile to desktop.
[586.28 → 587.72] Free in-game overlay.
[588.18 → 589.08] Connecting made easy.
[589.18 → 589.36] Okay.
[589.68 → 590.02] All right.
[590.52 → 593.44] I forget what the point I was trying to make was.
[595.16 → 597.56] I completely forget what the point I was trying to make was.
[599.54 → 599.90] Okay.
[600.18 → 601.46] So, Twitch is getting this thing.
[601.52 → 602.32] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[602.32 → 602.54] Right.
[602.68 → 608.00] We're, like, you sign up for a service, or you give your, like, you create a profile with
[608.00 → 613.04] the company, and you give them personal information, like your phone number, your email, your payment,
[613.48 → 615.38] your payment details, or whatever the case may be.
[615.62 → 621.20] And just, like, you know, one day you're Jose Cans eco, and you're, like, you're literally
[621.20 → 622.70] out in the field playing.
[622.70 → 627.28] And it gets announced on the news that you've been traded.
[627.80 → 628.60] You've been traded.
[628.72 → 630.02] Now you belong to someone else.
[630.22 → 630.54] Uh-huh.
[631.12 → 633.80] And they can just sort of acquire it.
[633.84 → 634.76] They can rebrand it.
[634.82 → 635.76] They can change the features.
[635.86 → 637.24] The entire vision can change.
[637.70 → 642.46] And as a user, you have no influence here at all.
[642.46 → 648.22] Does it bother you that you can be a Twitch streamer?
[648.32 → 650.94] So, I mean, okay, because it's one thing as just a user.
[651.04 → 658.24] But let's say you've invested significant time, whether it's developing a mod or whether
[658.24 → 660.34] it's building a following on a platform.
[660.44 → 665.30] Perfect example of that was, oh, that stupid platform that I never got into.
[665.40 → 665.64] Vine.
[665.76 → 665.94] Right.
[666.04 → 666.28] Vine.
[666.28 → 667.44] We're just like, boom, no.
[667.74 → 668.58] Now we're Twitter.
[668.86 → 668.96] Yep.
[669.04 → 671.20] Now Vine's just, yeah.
[671.20 → 674.88] If you don't have Twitter followers, if you're just a pure Liner, you're done.
[674.98 → 675.24] You're dead.
[677.04 → 679.66] Where Twitch can just kind of go, oh, yeah, we're selling to Amazon.
[679.88 → 683.30] And Curse, okay, yeah, we're selling to Twitch, which is owned by Amazon.
[683.46 → 687.58] And it's just like, it's almost like an exercise in just kind of collecting users.
[688.56 → 691.98] I mean, yeah, that's, at the end of the day, that's kind of what it seems like, right?
[691.98 → 697.14] And that's, you know, the game that a lot of people nowadays, including us to a degree,
[697.24 → 700.12] are playing is like, how do you get more eyeballs?
[701.20 → 701.84] You know what I mean?
[702.26 → 706.58] Like, the acquisition of Twitch is all about, okay, how do we integrate Amazon products
[706.58 → 710.36] into this thing that's already garnering, you know, hundreds of thousands to millions
[710.36 → 713.84] of unique users per day and sell through that?
[715.30 → 722.08] So, yeah, from a user perspective, it kind of feels, you know, it just feels crappy to
[722.08 → 725.02] kind of go, okay, well, here's this thing that maybe I really liked.
[725.22 → 726.52] Maybe I really liked Curse Voice.
[726.52 → 729.88] Maybe I really liked, you know, the way Twitch was before Amazon and now it changes.
[730.20 → 734.98] But, you know, there's always two sides to the coin.
[735.18 → 735.44] Yeah.
[735.62 → 735.92] Okay.
[736.00 → 736.44] Fair enough.
[738.12 → 740.24] What's with your obsession with Jose Cans eco?
[740.94 → 741.36] Oh, okay.
[741.36 → 745.24] I came into your office the other day, and you were like looking up like Jose Cans eco's
[745.24 → 746.16] steroid something.
[746.56 → 746.82] Okay.
[746.88 → 747.12] Okay.
[747.20 → 750.70] So, the backstory there, you know, it's not here right now.
[750.70 → 755.48] But I was trying to, I end up on these tangents sometimes when I'm writing.
[755.98 → 756.58] No kidding.
[757.32 → 758.36] No kidding.
[758.48 → 762.14] So, I was writing up my video on the LG Gram 2017.
[762.46 → 762.88] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[762.94 → 769.28] And I wanted a way to describe the change in the battery life.
[769.86 → 770.08] Okay.
[770.08 → 776.56] So, what LG did was they increased the overall weight of the unit by about 10%.
[776.56 → 777.02] Uh-huh.
[777.44 → 780.86] Of which all of it is pure battery.
[781.34 → 783.98] Just like cramming in more battery.
[784.30 → 784.46] Yeah.
[784.54 → 789.62] So, the line in the video, I wanted it to be, it was like going to be like more raided up
[789.62 → 790.90] than X.
[791.12 → 791.38] Ah.
[791.38 → 795.74] And I was trying to figure out what could possibly be the most raided up thing on
[795.74 → 796.04] Earth.
[796.04 → 803.88] And so, I ended up doing a bunch of, sometimes just for one reference or one line in a script.
[803.94 → 808.94] Because I think the finished script ends up being something like more raided up than late
[808.94 → 811.42] 90s baseball or early 90s baseball or something.
[811.62 → 813.62] Early 90s MLB, I think is what I say.
[813.86 → 813.96] Sure.
[814.86 → 819.26] And in order to write that line and make sure I get like the era right and make sure it's
[819.26 → 820.80] about as raided up as anything can be.
[820.88 → 821.58] I actually end up.
[821.58 → 823.12] Like an hour and a half of research.
[823.12 → 828.22] I end up down these rabbit holes where I'm like, okay, so is it Cans eco or Maguire?
[828.42 → 832.22] You know, who's the who do we, who raided the most?
[832.24 → 833.74] Wasn't Bonds part of that era too?
[833.96 → 835.90] Well, I think Bonds never admitted it.
[835.94 → 836.18] Yeah.
[836.24 → 841.10] So, and like, I didn't want to, because remember too, it's more than just me getting the era
[841.10 → 842.90] of the riding right.
[843.02 → 845.10] It's making sure that it's confirmed and.
[845.28 → 847.14] And that I'm not going to get sued for libel.
[847.28 → 847.78] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[847.78 → 853.30] Or like defamatory statements or whatever the I mean, can you imagine if that was the
[853.30 → 854.12] end of this story?
[855.12 → 862.04] If like, I busted my butt and built this company and all these people came together and helped
[862.04 → 866.32] me run this company, and we were all like doing a great job and kicking ass.
[866.46 → 868.02] And then you were doing steroids, so YouTube kicked you off the platform.
[868.02 → 869.12] No, that's not.
[871.02 → 873.84] You don't get kicked off YouTube for doing steroids.
[875.04 → 880.56] No, but, but if I made a careless comment about some baseball player.
[880.68 → 881.44] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[881.54 → 887.50] Who may even have been on steroids, and they come after us, they sue us, they sue my pants
[887.50 → 889.18] off and I can't.
[889.18 → 889.46] Yeah.
[889.54 → 896.04] You know, get my pants back on and Twitch knocks me off their platform for not having
[896.04 → 896.74] pants on.
[898.08 → 899.12] That could happen.
[899.90 → 902.58] Did you see the guy on the news this morning who likely wasn't wearing pants?
[902.68 → 905.86] The thing where like he was on the he was interviewing about Korea.
[906.00 → 906.94] He's like a Korea expert.
[907.36 → 911.60] His kids come into the room, and he's just, he's sitting there at the table like this and
[911.60 → 915.02] just like looking back and then like somebody comes in and wrangles the kids, but he doesn't
[915.02 → 915.58] move an inch.
[915.58 → 917.72] I'm like, that dude is not wearing pants.
[919.94 → 923.48] The second I saw that, I'm like, that dude's only got briefs on, man.
[923.54 → 924.08] Holy shit.
[925.00 → 925.86] I mean, holy crap.
[926.04 → 926.26] Sorry.
[926.58 → 926.90] Oops.
[928.12 → 929.68] This is a PG show.
[929.82 → 930.06] Okay.
[930.24 → 934.40] I'm not, I'm not on the, the live TV very often.
[935.60 → 941.02] The CIA listed BlackBerry's car software as a possible target.
[941.02 → 943.94] So the original article here is from Bloomberg.
[943.94 → 947.24] There's, there was a big thing with WikiLeaks this week.
[947.32 → 951.18] We're not going to get too far into it, but we thought this was pretty interesting just
[951.18 → 958.20] because BlackBerry is one of the few Canadian tech firms that remains and news, news about
[958.20 → 958.64] BlackBerry.
[958.70 → 959.38] Is this just an ad?
[959.54 → 963.90] News about BlackBerry really couldn't get much worse than it's, than it's been over the
[963.90 → 964.30] last.
[964.46 → 964.84] Yeah.
[964.84 → 970.08] Well, ever since Steve Jobs stood on stage and went, this is the thing that is going
[970.08 → 972.96] to absolutely crush the rest of the smartphone market.
[973.20 → 973.56] Yep.
[973.56 → 979.12] So in a nutshell, man, like they're trying to rebrand around security.
[979.68 → 984.84] But in a nutshell, on Tuesday, WikiLeaks released over 8,000 CIA documents, some of which detail
[984.84 → 988.80] cyberattacks on iOS and Android phones, Samsung smart TVs.
[988.80 → 992.16] Oh, the Samsung smart TV one was really creepy.
[992.70 → 995.30] What was the details of that one again?
[995.40 → 996.02] I can't remember off the top of my head.
[996.02 → 1001.26] It was something to the effect of like, it infects your TV with malware and puts it in
[1001.26 → 1008.14] like a fake off mode so that even when it's off, it's still recording like everything,
[1008.98 → 1009.30] essentially.
[1009.86 → 1010.86] Yeah, there we go.
[1011.14 → 1013.10] It's called the Weeping Angel tool.
[1013.10 → 1017.96] And so the CIA could listen in on Samsung smart TVs.
[1018.12 → 1022.20] And it's like, I don't know about you guys, but I watch all kinds of stuff on my TV.
[1023.14 → 1023.50] Okay.
[1026.94 → 1027.34] Right.
[1028.32 → 1029.34] You know, you know what I'm saying?
[1029.40 → 1030.84] I mean, big screen TV, right?
[1031.08 → 1031.44] 4K.
[1031.80 → 1032.62] I mean, what are we using?
[1032.78 → 1033.56] Lord of the Rings?
[1034.16 → 1035.08] Not necessarily.
[1035.54 → 1036.38] Lord of the something.
[1036.64 → 1037.76] Lord of the something.
[1038.82 → 1040.44] I mean, there's, there are rings out there.
[1040.50 → 1041.42] Let me tell you about rings.
[1041.42 → 1041.72] Okay.
[1043.10 → 1045.02] Wow.
[1046.34 → 1046.70] Wow.
[1046.84 → 1048.10] Well, that got off the rails fast.
[1048.46 → 1051.80] I think, I think there were a few of those in the weirdest purchases on Amazon.
[1051.96 → 1053.26] Yeah, I think there were a few of those.
[1054.32 → 1060.76] Anyway, so BlackBerry's automotive software was specifically mentioned as a potential mission
[1060.76 → 1063.78] area by the CIA embedded devices branch.
[1064.00 → 1066.36] It's used by 60 million cars.
[1066.48 → 1066.80] That's great.
[1066.80 → 1069.98] It's unclear at this time if the CIA moved forward with the attacks.
[1069.98 → 1072.66] But BlackBerry basically said the only thing they can say.
[1073.16 → 1077.90] We are not currently aware of any attacks or exploits against BlackBerry products or services.
[1079.10 → 1081.34] That's actually, that's a very broad statement.
[1081.68 → 1081.94] Yeah.
[1082.06 → 1087.56] We are not aware of any attacks or exploits against BlackBerry products or services.
[1087.56 → 1090.24] That's a very, very strong blanket statement.
[1090.52 → 1090.74] Yeah.
[1090.80 → 1092.08] But they're not currently aware.
[1092.24 → 1094.12] So there definitely could be.
[1094.12 → 1103.26] So they make specialized operating systems for industrial products like this QNX makes wind turbines,
[1103.50 → 1109.20] anti-tank missiles, and most importantly, in-car infotainment systems, which by the way are
[1109.20 → 1109.62] terrible.
[1109.78 → 1114.52] We should do a video on like in-car infotainment system done right.
[1114.52 → 1118.40] I was shopping for a minivan back about, wow.
[1118.80 → 1119.66] A year ago almost?
[1119.82 → 1121.24] Back about six, eight months ago.
[1121.36 → 1121.80] Something like that.
[1121.80 → 1121.92] Yeah.
[1122.40 → 1124.22] And I drove a used one.
[1124.30 → 1126.76] That was from like 2005 or 2006.
[1127.00 → 1128.78] Like it really, wait, what year is it now?
[1129.20 → 1129.60] 17.
[1130.66 → 1130.98] Crap.
[1131.08 → 1131.92] No, it was newer than that.
[1132.00 → 1132.12] Sorry.
[1132.20 → 1134.86] It was like 2015 or 2016 or something like that.
[1135.08 → 1136.18] You thought it was 2007?
[1136.34 → 1137.20] Just shut up, okay?
[1137.20 → 1138.20] Just shut up, okay?
[1142.94 → 1150.14] Anywho, the one I was driving was the RES, so Rear Entertainment System version.
[1150.52 → 1150.90] Oh, yeah.
[1150.98 → 1152.58] And so I crawled back to look at it.
[1152.62 → 1155.34] I'm like, this is the worst TN panel I've ever seen.
[1155.90 → 1157.10] Are you for real?
[1158.42 → 1160.02] Composite and S-Video in?
[1160.68 → 1161.72] I mean, that was all it had.
[1161.78 → 1164.70] And it wasn't even like, it might not have been two or three years old.
[1164.70 → 1167.10] Like it was right before a refresh or something like that.
[1167.92 → 1170.10] But it wasn't like 10 years old either.
[1170.22 → 1171.34] And I was like, this is stupid.
[1171.76 → 1173.34] You've got to be able to do better than this.
[1173.40 → 1174.74] So that was when I was kind of inspired.
[1174.84 → 1177.08] I think we should do something around that at some point.
[1177.20 → 1177.62] I agree.
[1178.62 → 1197.18] I think, you know, the counter to this, you know, the concern about they have all these exploits, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, that I've been hearing, you know, people in the know making is, okay, well, don't you want us to have access to these so that we know what people are capable of?
[1197.20 → 1201.36] And so that we can spy on potentially dangerous people.
[1201.36 → 1205.22] But we all know, like, that's like...
[1205.22 → 1208.26] If that was really the objective, they'd be closing the back doors.
[1208.44 → 1208.76] Yeah.
[1209.24 → 1209.52] Yeah.
[1209.78 → 1210.10] Exactly.
[1210.76 → 1217.08] And that's the thing where it's like, yeah, if you guys were being totally honest, these would not be a thing anymore.
[1217.08 → 1218.08] So...
[1218.08 → 1218.58] Okay.
[1218.70 → 1219.84] Let's wrap up this topic.
[1219.96 → 1230.28] And then I've actually got a new one that I was inspired by an email I just received to cover because it feels like it's something that I really should have talked about a long time ago.
[1230.46 → 1232.52] And I'm going to do it once and for all now.
[1232.58 → 1234.04] So maybe I won't get these emails anymore.
[1235.70 → 1237.66] Actually, I guess that's pretty much it.
[1237.74 → 1241.40] So security research showed they could hack into a Jeep, taking control away from the driver on the highway.
[1241.52 → 1244.14] BlackBerry was quick to say its tech wasn't involved in that breach.
[1244.14 → 1246.98] But, yeah, anyway.
[1247.44 → 1247.84] Okay.
[1248.54 → 1257.84] So I just got an email from someone asking about, like, under license doing a French version of the WAN show.
[1258.08 → 1261.66] And I get people messaging me about this all the time.
[1261.92 → 1268.80] You know, we'd love to work with you to create, like, a UK branch office of Linus Media Group.
[1268.80 → 1277.16] Or we'd love to work with you guys to create a Punjabi version of your reviews or whatever the case may be.
[1277.94 → 1280.82] And the answer is no.
[1280.82 → 1293.18] Because the thing that is special about Linus Tech Tips or the WAN show, or what do we do all day?
[1293.56 → 1296.00] Tech Quickie or Channel Super Fun.
[1296.40 → 1296.86] Sleep.
[1296.86 → 1307.82] Is not the idea of having a podcast about what happened in the technology world this week.
[1308.14 → 1309.32] That's been done.
[1309.74 → 1316.70] People tune into the WAN show for some inexplicable reason that goes beyond that, apparently.
[1316.70 → 1325.56] Because if it were as simple as taking the approximate format of the WAN show, which, quite frankly, doesn't have much of a format.
[1326.26 → 1329.04] It's probably the least formatted show there is.
[1329.04 → 1330.02] I mean, basically, okay.
[1330.36 → 1331.28] Here's the format.
[1331.56 → 1333.16] We have a list of topics.
[1333.58 → 1335.28] We're going to maybe talk about them.
[1335.82 → 1337.14] A lot of the time we don't.
[1337.66 → 1338.54] That's the format.
[1338.58 → 1338.78] No, no.
[1338.78 → 1342.96] I'm going to take you guys deep inside the bowels.
[1344.94 → 1345.42] Okay.
[1346.20 → 1347.70] What are you talking about?
[1347.70 → 1347.88] No, no.
[1348.00 → 1350.18] Bowels is not necessarily the rectum.
[1351.22 → 1352.72] That's not where I was going.
[1352.86 → 1355.12] Bowels of the Earth is not dirty.
[1355.52 → 1356.60] Can you get to the point?
[1356.64 → 1356.94] Okay.
[1357.06 → 1357.44] Come on.
[1357.46 → 1362.18] So I'm going to take you guys deep inside the bowels of the inner workings of Linus Media Group.
[1362.18 → 1374.14] And the inspiration for the WAN show was some other tech podcast that I had never actually watched, but I was vaguely aware of.
[1374.76 → 1379.86] I was like, okay, like this format, people seem to be watching it.
[1380.28 → 1382.40] Let's like kind of do that.
[1382.46 → 1384.32] But then I never actually watched it.
[1384.32 → 1390.14] And I just kind of like was like, okay, we'll just look at like we'll make it the forums' problem.
[1390.42 → 1400.80] We'll just look at the tech news subsection of the forum, and we'll incentivize people to post tech news there by calling out that they posted tech news there on this show.
[1400.80 → 1407.74] And we'll create a positive feedback loop where effectively our show will get written for us just by hosting a show.
[1408.80 → 1410.82] That was where the WAN show came from.
[1410.92 → 1412.82] I was like, we don't have time.
[1412.82 → 1413.16] Outsourcing.
[1413.16 → 1416.72] We don't have time to do seven video uploads per week.
[1417.20 → 1428.06] If we set aside an hour and a half on Fridays to host, to just sit there, then that content kind of makes itself.
[1428.70 → 1430.54] That's the inspiration for the WAN show.
[1430.72 → 1440.98] And that's why the vibe of the WAN show is that it's just like me and Luke or me and someone else or Luke and someone else or someone else and someone else.
[1440.98 → 1445.40] Goofing around on a Friday afternoon talking about tech.
[1445.86 → 1447.72] Because that's all it really was.
[1447.76 → 1449.40] We needed to fill an upload slot.
[1449.80 → 1454.88] And we had this great resource that was our community sitting there discussing the tech that they thought was most relevant.
[1455.02 → 1459.30] And we figured, hey, let's take those two things and let's put them together.
[1459.30 → 1459.86] Boom.
[1459.92 → 1460.82] The WAN show was born.
[1461.58 → 1462.56] It's like, I don't know.
[1462.62 → 1467.08] A lot of the time people, I think, think we have like some master plan.
[1467.22 → 1468.02] Master plan.
[1468.36 → 1470.48] And we're like out to take over the world.
[1470.58 → 1470.98] And you know what?
[1471.00 → 1472.68] A lot of the time we do have a master plan.
[1472.74 → 1474.32] And we actually are kind of smart.
[1474.86 → 1475.86] But sometimes.
[1475.86 → 1482.00] The master plan is usually about 30% plan and 170% execution.
[1482.18 → 1482.62] That's right.
[1482.70 → 1482.82] Yeah.
[1482.92 → 1485.42] Just we have this vague idea.
[1485.82 → 1491.88] It's like on a whiteboard that someone knocked over and then kind of rubbed across the carpet.
[1492.10 → 1492.54] So you can't read it.
[1492.54 → 1494.34] It's like, okay, here's step one and step two.
[1494.48 → 1496.06] Step three, four, five, six.
[1496.40 → 1496.84] TBD.
[1496.98 → 1497.92] We're just going to do it.
[1498.00 → 1498.62] Let's just go.
[1498.72 → 1500.98] A lot of the time there isn't even a profit plan.
[1500.98 → 1506.16] Like WAN show these days is actually one of our easiest spots to sell to sponsors.
[1506.30 → 1507.04] Is that still correct?
[1507.68 → 1508.04] I don't know.
[1508.12 → 1509.06] I don't do that anymore.
[1509.38 → 1510.74] Does anyone do that anymore?
[1510.88 → 1511.28] I don't think.
[1511.30 → 1512.18] Are we still making money?
[1512.18 → 1512.48] It just does itself.
[1513.74 → 1514.18] Okay.
[1514.32 → 1514.76] Well, anyway.
[1515.94 → 1517.46] We'll take that meeting offline.
[1520.08 → 1528.00] Anyway, for at least some time, the WAN show was one of the – we had no idea how we were going to make money on the WAN show.
[1528.00 → 1529.64] We were just like, you know what?
[1529.64 → 1531.68] But Twit TV is a thing.
[1532.30 → 1534.04] All they do is podcasts.
[1534.60 → 1536.34] There must be a business model here.
[1536.68 → 1541.84] So let's just create a podcast with all those other factors that I told you guys.
[1542.48 → 1547.18] And, like, surely someone will want to get involved at some point.
[1547.50 → 1548.62] Maybe someone will watch it.
[1548.64 → 1551.42] And if they do, then maybe sponsors will care.
[1551.68 → 1553.74] That was the master plan.
[1554.16 → 1555.84] Anyway, getting back to your point.
[1556.10 → 1557.26] I don't remember what my point was.
[1557.26 → 1561.06] Well, you were talking about regionalizing our ideas and stuff.
[1561.24 → 1561.50] Right, right.
[1561.52 → 1564.10] It's about the people who are in the video, you know, usually.
[1564.82 → 1571.08] It's not necessarily about the format of the show or what's on the screen outside the people who are in it.
[1571.08 → 1577.96] The idea of creating a video reviewing the iPhone 7 is not good.
[1578.64 → 1581.18] I mean, it's a good idea, but it's not a unique idea.
[1581.18 → 1592.18] It's not going to, like – it's not going to make it so that the French version of the WAN show or the Indian version of Linus Tech Tips or whatever the case may be, it's not going to make that successful.
[1592.18 → 1605.24] If you want to have a podcast, and you want to have a tech review YouTube channel or Dailymotion channel or whatever, they're French, do it.
[1605.78 → 1610.42] You shouldn't be licensing our brand to do it.
[1610.48 → 1611.92] That's not going to make you successful.
[1612.02 → 1612.62] You should be building your own.
[1612.62 → 1617.84] So this was actually a great conversation that I had back when I was doing the house painting thing.
[1618.02 → 1618.14] Okay.
[1618.54 → 1629.78] So the guy who runs Student Works Painting in Western Canada bought rights to the name from the guy who runs it in Eastern Canada.
[1630.20 → 1635.38] And those two companies have zero affiliation financially.
[1636.02 → 1638.80] I'm pretty sure they don't even write each other Christmas cards.
[1638.90 → 1640.96] In fact, I don't think the relationship is very good.
[1640.96 → 1643.24] But then he has to pay money to the other guy.
[1643.36 → 1644.38] I don't think it's ongoing.
[1644.56 → 1645.62] I think he bought it.
[1645.64 → 1646.28] Bought a license.
[1646.30 → 1648.24] Bought the license, like, outright.
[1648.42 → 1652.26] Bought the rights to the name so they would carve up the territory that way.
[1652.74 → 1656.78] And what he said was that was one of the biggest mistakes he ever made.
[1657.52 → 1658.84] Because why?
[1659.68 → 1663.82] No one in Western Canada had heard of Student Works Painting.
[1664.52 → 1667.94] He might as well have called it Ass Works Painting.
[1668.42 → 1669.62] I mean, probably not that.
[1669.62 → 1674.62] But the point is, he could have called it Pro Student Painting.
[1675.14 → 1677.02] Or Student Summer Painting.
[1677.20 → 1677.74] Or whatever.
[1677.86 → 1678.60] It doesn't matter.
[1679.06 → 1680.72] Wouldn't have had to pay a licensing fee.
[1681.04 → 1682.56] The idea is just as good.
[1682.68 → 1687.70] And it ultimately came down to him to hustle and build the brand anyway.
[1687.94 → 1689.32] Regardless of that name.
[1689.32 → 1698.52] And in much the same way that nobody should license the idea of making reaction videos from the Fine Brothers,
[1698.88 → 1702.84] nobody should license the idea of the WAN show from us.
[1702.84 → 1709.12] So I'm not saying that, like, you're stupid for wanting to have a French tech podcast.
[1709.48 → 1710.36] Great idea.
[1710.76 → 1716.48] I'm saying that what's a bad idea is trying to clone what we're doing.
[1716.48 → 1719.48] Because you should be out there trying to do your thing.
[1720.30 → 1723.94] Finding what someone else is doing and copying it is not successful.
[1723.94 → 1725.62] In fact, well, it could be.
[1725.92 → 1729.14] But, I mean, it won't necessarily lead to success.
[1729.52 → 1734.96] In fact, it is my personal belief that one of the things that works about Linus Media Group
[1734.96 → 1741.30] is the fact that when we try to copy something, it's often without having ever watched the original.
[1741.30 → 1746.98] Where we just take the idea, and then it's really mostly our own ideas.
[1747.34 → 1752.04] Like, I think, you know, and this is sort of, this is me kind of going off on even more of a tangent.
[1752.70 → 1756.42] One of the things that I think is really cool about the way that we make videos
[1756.42 → 1760.18] is that I don't have any formal video production training at all.
[1760.66 → 1763.62] Everything that we've done has been through trial and error.
[1764.00 → 1766.30] And I think that you see, okay, not everything.
[1766.76 → 1769.70] We have people here who are, anyway, to wrap it up.
[1769.70 → 1771.60] My ideas are usually trial and error.
[1771.66 → 1772.34] Why don't we say it that way?
[1772.36 → 1775.28] To wrap it up, you should be doing your own thing.
[1775.50 → 1778.40] Don't, you know, try to follow in the footsteps of somebody else.
[1778.66 → 1781.78] Of course, you should take influence from others who inspire you
[1781.78 → 1784.68] and who make you want to create and do what you do.
[1784.76 → 1786.04] Be inspired. Don't license.
[1786.36 → 1788.18] Yes. Be inspired. Don't license.
[1788.76 → 1792.56] And just grind hard, and you'll make it happen.
[1792.70 → 1798.52] So this is what, like, a just work hard and bust your butt growth curve looks like.
[1798.52 → 1800.64] You might not ever, this is CES.
[1800.82 → 1801.42] That, like, doesn't count.
[1801.42 → 1801.94] That doesn't count.
[1802.00 → 1803.62] So is this and so is, oh, no, wait.
[1803.72 → 1804.88] No, this is Computer.
[1805.14 → 1807.06] So is this, so is this.
[1807.14 → 1807.80] These spikes.
[1807.92 → 1809.30] These are CES spikes.
[1809.82 → 1813.26] So what you're really looking at here is just slow and steady wins the race.
[1814.32 → 1815.36] Have new ideas.
[1815.54 → 1816.48] Try new things.
[1816.72 → 1817.32] Iterate on them.
[1817.38 → 1817.80] See what works.
[1817.88 → 1818.44] See what doesn't.
[1818.54 → 1819.10] Keep what works.
[1819.20 → 1819.98] Throw away what doesn't.
[1820.04 → 1820.74] By the way, you're fired.
[1821.30 → 1821.62] All right.
[1822.46 → 1822.78] Later.
[1823.06 → 1825.42] I didn't realize this was a motivational speaking podcast.
[1825.62 → 1826.72] I thought this was about technology.
[1826.72 → 1828.64] Well, that's the thing.
[1828.74 → 1830.78] The WAN show is about whatever the WAN show is about.
[1831.10 → 1833.50] And that's part of what makes the WAN show special as well.
[1833.62 → 1834.26] Am I actually fired?
[1834.34 → 1837.48] Like, I would love to go play Breath of the Wild next week instead of coming to work.
[1838.36 → 1839.58] No, you're not fired.
[1839.82 → 1840.82] You had your time off.
[1841.14 → 1842.20] You spent it at Disneyland.
[1842.46 → 1844.14] You could have been playing Breath of the Wild.
[1844.28 → 1845.34] That is not my problem.
[1845.48 → 1845.72] That's true.
[1846.52 → 1846.92] That's true.
[1847.30 → 1848.60] Have you played much Breath of the Wild?
[1848.78 → 1849.16] How is it?
[1849.50 → 1850.36] It's excellent.
[1850.80 → 1853.06] It's, like, my favourite game in years, literally.
[1853.68 → 1855.30] So, I'm down.
[1855.94 → 1856.76] Yeah, it's excellent.
[1856.92 → 1861.16] It's, like, probably one of the best open world games I've ever played, like, hands down.
[1861.46 → 1865.80] So, like, climbing a mountain in that game is fun.
[1866.48 → 1866.84] Really?
[1868.36 → 1868.76] Okay.
[1868.84 → 1869.32] To me, at least.
[1869.48 → 1873.32] Like, there's, like, challenge in exploring the scenery.
[1874.02 → 1874.42] Cool.
[1874.76 → 1877.40] Which is, like, something that I haven't experienced in a game before.
[1877.64 → 1878.90] And, of course, there are problems with it.
[1878.92 → 1880.68] And some of it gets repetitive and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[1880.68 → 1884.12] But it is the most fun I've had in a video game in years.
[1884.60 → 1885.32] So, that's...
[1885.32 → 1886.58] I might have to play it then.
[1886.72 → 1886.96] Yeah.
[1887.16 → 1888.18] I don't even have a Wii U.
[1888.86 → 1889.72] You can borrow mine after.
[1890.62 → 1890.90] Okay.
[1891.18 → 1891.44] Sold.
[1891.68 → 1892.12] Yeah, done.
[1892.28 → 1892.50] Sold.
[1892.70 → 1893.26] Next topic?
[1893.62 → 1894.92] Thank you, Physical Media.
[1895.26 → 1895.78] Heck, yeah.
[1895.86 → 1896.80] Actually, do we need new sponsors?
[1898.26 → 1899.06] Oh, I don't know.
[1899.10 → 1899.24] Maybe.
[1899.34 → 1901.48] I don't know what time it is, because this is set to the wrong time.
[1901.60 → 1902.68] We're 40 minutes in.
[1902.74 → 1903.42] 40 minutes in?
[1903.46 → 1904.06] Okay, yeah, sure.
[1904.12 → 1904.92] Why don't we do...
[1904.92 → 1909.00] Speaking of the WAN show being a good draw for sponsors...
[1909.00 → 1910.76] Colton, does the WAN show still sell well?
[1911.50 → 1911.70] Yeah.
[1912.00 → 1912.20] Yeah?
[1912.42 → 1912.58] Yeah.
[1912.72 → 1913.34] Okay, cool.
[1913.44 → 1913.70] Good job.
[1913.82 → 1914.74] People like the WAN show.
[1914.80 → 1915.60] People like the WAN show?
[1915.72 → 1916.68] Sponsors like the WAN show?
[1916.80 → 1917.08] Okay.
[1917.26 → 1918.46] People like the WAN show.
[1918.80 → 1920.02] People like the WAN show.
[1920.06 → 1920.92] It's easy to sell.
[1922.18 → 1923.76] Why is this...
[1923.76 → 1926.44] Why am I not able to open up a new frickin' window here?
[1926.58 → 1926.94] What are you doing?
[1927.10 → 1927.42] Wow.
[1927.60 → 1928.06] I'm trying...
[1928.06 → 1928.28] Swear words.
[1928.28 → 1929.22] I said frickin'.
[1929.22 → 1930.68] Frickin' is not a swear word.
[1930.70 → 1931.70] You said frickin'.
[1931.70 → 1932.24] You know what?
[1932.38 → 1933.56] Eat a dick.
[1933.88 → 1934.56] That...
[1934.56 → 1935.06] Wow!
[1935.06 → 1938.62] Good thing we have the new audio set up, so hopefully that didn't rip...
[1938.62 → 1941.84] Hopefully you didn't just destroy everybody's ears.
[1943.10 → 1945.12] Yeah, some people consider dick a swear word.
[1945.72 → 1946.58] Well, it is.
[1946.82 → 1947.22] No!
[1947.22 → 1948.72] It's a dirty, dirty word.
[1948.72 → 1950.42] It is not a dirty, dirty word.
[1950.48 → 1952.14] You just have to shower once in a while.
[1952.22 → 1953.14] Get the cheese off.
[1954.94 → 1955.84] And on that note...
[1955.84 → 1957.16] Wait, there's food down there?
[1957.16 → 1957.64] Yeah.
[1957.64 → 1964.74] I wouldn't tell you to eat it if there wasn't any food!
[1970.08 → 1970.98] I'm done!
[1971.16 → 1973.08] And we killed Nick.
[1973.32 → 1974.08] Nick's done.
[1974.32 → 1975.26] Nick's done.
[1979.26 → 1979.78] Oh...
[1979.78 → 1980.46] Yeah.
[1981.00 → 1981.52] I mean, it's...
[1981.52 → 1983.60] It's a terrible show.
[1983.92 → 1985.82] You don't want to have this show.
[1985.82 → 1988.22] You don't want to be the one responsible for this show.
[1988.34 → 1988.58] Really?
[1988.66 → 1990.16] You don't want me talking about dick cheese.
[1990.24 → 1990.44] Yeah.
[1991.30 → 1992.42] Oh, my God.
[1992.48 → 1993.68] This is a tech show, okay?
[1993.72 → 1995.48] Can you keep things respectable, please?
[1995.88 → 1996.72] Yeah, me.
[1997.00 → 1997.40] Uh-huh.
[1998.00 → 1998.52] Totally.
[1998.74 → 1998.96] Okay.
[1999.14 → 1999.68] Tech topic.
[1999.78 → 2000.30] Tech topic.
[2000.38 → 2001.12] Then we'll do sponsors.
[2001.38 → 2001.40] All right.
[2001.40 → 2001.50] All right.
[2001.50 → 2004.72] I don't want the sponsors to accidentally tune in too early...
[2004.72 → 2005.38] Yeah, accidentally tune in too early...
[2005.38 → 2008.32] ...and realize what they're paying for.
[2010.06 → 2010.46] Okay.
[2011.06 → 2012.24] So, Laden.
[2012.52 → 2013.64] Posted on the forum.
[2014.52 → 2015.40] Is this the...
[2015.40 → 2015.80] Yeah, okay.
[2015.82 → 2017.16] What has been...
[2017.16 → 2020.72] Oh, by the way, huge shout out to Laden for being a float plane pilot!
[2021.42 → 2021.54] Woo!
[2022.00 → 2022.26] Woo!
[2023.26 → 2025.52] After sponsors, we should tell people what's on floatplanes.
[2025.52 → 2026.60] Yeah, we should definitely do that.
[2026.80 → 2029.52] So, as I was looking on YouTube about Ry zen Overclock,
[2029.62 → 2032.84] and Blip pity Sloppily, Overclock, Sleep Bug, etc., etc.
[2033.98 → 2037.82] Basically, the summary of all of this is that...
[2038.48 → 2040.20] And we've done a fair bit of investigation.
[2040.48 → 2042.10] We're working on our own overclocking guide.
[2042.10 → 2045.44] But when the high-precision event timer is off...
[2045.44 → 2049.44] If your machine goes to sleep...
[2049.44 → 2051.80] Then wakes up...
[2051.80 → 2057.00] Your benchmarks will appear to have higher scores.
[2057.00 → 2057.86] Okay?
[2057.86 → 2062.24] So, this is actually because the system timer is running slow.
[2062.76 → 2070.80] So, Windows' clock, and anything that uses timing is actually slowed by a fair margin.
[2071.24 → 2075.14] So, benchmarks, which measure compute time, will score higher.
[2075.14 → 2077.92] So, I believe these notes are from Anthony.
[2078.04 → 2078.60] Hold on one second.
[2078.90 → 2079.66] Hey, Anthony!
[2080.42 → 2082.94] Those Cine bench scores, those are your scores, right?
[2083.66 → 2084.44] Okay, cool.
[2084.60 → 2084.98] Thanks, man.
[2085.52 → 2085.76] Okay.
[2086.14 → 2091.98] So, we got $17.50 in Cine bench pre-sleep.
[2092.48 → 2093.54] Put the machine to sleep.
[2094.02 → 2094.86] Woke it back up.
[2095.12 → 2096.30] Over $2,000.
[2096.30 → 2103.22] So, there seems to be a fair bit of confusion out there right now around Ry zen performance.
[2103.52 → 2111.18] Because if people are reporting benchmark scores based on some of the tips and tricks out there
[2111.18 → 2115.18] that involve turning off PET and going to sleep and waking,
[2115.76 → 2120.64] those benchmarks are not actually representative of real performance.
[2120.64 → 2124.44] To be clear, Ry zen does perform very well.
[2124.72 → 2129.64] But what this seems to indicate to us, and actually, hold on, I'm just going to...
[2130.32 → 2130.98] Hey, Anthony!
[2131.78 → 2132.06] Yep.
[2132.90 → 2140.26] Our scores on the crosshair did not change after we disabled PET,
[2140.34 → 2142.02] as long as we didn't go to sleep, right?
[2143.12 → 2143.60] Yeah.
[2143.84 → 2148.64] So, the one you did go to the first day, that off the time, it did, and then it did.
[2148.80 → 2149.22] Got it.
[2149.30 → 2149.58] Okay.
[2149.58 → 2156.82] So, our review was done with PET on, because we didn't receive the reviewer guidance
[2156.82 → 2159.58] that PET might be bugged on the crosshair in time.
[2159.58 → 2161.72] So, on would be correct, right?
[2161.86 → 2162.74] Correct scores?
[2162.88 → 2170.34] On means that our scores, while maybe not quite optimal, are at least...
[2170.34 → 2171.64] Not affected by the timer bug.
[2171.64 → 2176.08] Not affected by the bug that makes them appear artificially inflated.
[2176.32 → 2176.52] Okay.
[2176.96 → 2178.00] So, there you go.
[2178.00 → 2179.00] Yeah.
[2179.00 → 2180.00] Yeah.
[2180.00 → 2189.28] So, the window sleep bug makes AMD Ryzen overclock higher and gives better benchmark results.
[2189.28 → 2196.26] So, it requires further investigation, which is why our OC guide is coming out probably next week or the week after,
[2196.56 → 2198.34] and not this week.
[2198.34 → 2203.34] So, like, as a relative layman, like, what would cause something like that?
[2203.40 → 2204.48] Do we have any idea?
[2204.48 → 2204.54] Yeah.
[2205.54 → 2217.78] Basically, the scuttlebutt is that AMD could have delayed the launch of Ry zen and squashed some of these types of bugs.
[2217.78 → 2229.74] These bugs don't appear to cause risk of user data loss or anything devastating like that,
[2229.74 → 2234.78] but that there are some definite early adopter...
[2234.78 → 2236.22] Quirks.
[2236.22 → 2243.96] Quirks and oddities that could have been fairly easily dealt with if they had put it off a little bit longer.
[2244.96 → 2247.00] So, that is sort of the...
[2247.00 → 2248.00] That's our takeaway.
[2248.46 → 2250.32] And, you know, why...
[2250.32 → 2257.70] I know the question's coming, because it's a question that I ask, and we debated internally, and it's a fair question.
[2257.70 → 2262.30] Why not report on this in the Ry zen launch review?
[2262.82 → 2267.60] And the reason for that is because we can say with a very high degree of confidence
[2267.60 → 2273.72] that smart people like AMD and Asus are going to get their heads together.
[2274.12 → 2279.64] They're going to get feedback from early adopter users who, again, it is my personal belief,
[2279.92 → 2285.66] know or should know what they're getting themselves into buying a brand-new CPU on a brand-new chipset,
[2285.66 → 2291.10] running a brand-new memory controller, brand-new PCIe controller, brand-new brick and everything.
[2291.70 → 2298.22] It is my belief that AMD and Asus will solve little weird bugs.
[2298.90 → 2299.92] In short order.
[2300.46 → 2307.40] That review, covering the performance of the Ry zen 1800X, has to sit there for the next decade,
[2307.70 → 2309.04] if all goes according to plan.
[2309.42 → 2312.96] And I'm not going to spend, you know, 20% of my video,
[2312.96 → 2317.06] the precious little time that I have to talk to you guys,
[2317.44 → 2321.66] talking about some weird crap we ran into, that by the time you buy one,
[2321.72 → 2327.36] by the time it gets put in a box and gets transported on a truck to your house
[2327.36 → 2329.60] and you plug it in, is going to be irrelevant.
[2330.32 → 2333.92] So that's why we tend not to overdo it on that stuff.
[2333.92 → 2337.40] And the concern is obviously there with, you know,
[2337.74 → 2343.36] what if this is causing people to make purchasing decisions based on, you know,
[2343.48 → 2345.78] inflated benchmarks, numbers, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[2346.56 → 2348.22] Which our numbers are not inflated.
[2348.30 → 2348.46] Yep.
[2348.96 → 2350.00] Which our numbers are not inflated.
[2350.02 → 2356.88] And the other concern is causing people to avoid purchasing something that is legitimately very good
[2356.88 → 2361.20] because of a very small issue that will be ironed out in a number of days.
[2361.30 → 2361.42] Yeah.
[2362.60 → 2362.92] So.
[2363.10 → 2364.96] Or weeks or whatever, whatever it ends up being.
[2365.16 → 2366.48] That's, that's where we're at.
[2366.82 → 2367.08] Okay.
[2367.18 → 2367.40] Okay.
[2367.42 → 2369.34] Another thing people can stop messaging me about.
[2369.46 → 2370.38] Paladin 123.
[2371.12 → 2372.46] Canadians don't like this.
[2372.48 → 2372.76] Okay.
[2373.22 → 2374.58] What time is it in Canada?
[2374.58 → 2376.38] We have, we have four and a half-time zones.
[2376.50 → 2376.66] Okay.
[2377.98 → 2379.84] It is many times in Canada.
[2380.16 → 2380.86] Canada is huge.
[2381.20 → 2386.28] We have lots of trees, rocks, water, oil, and time zones.
[2386.28 → 2387.42] That's what we have.
[2387.50 → 2388.10] Not a lot of people.
[2388.36 → 2389.70] We do all live in igloos though.
[2391.26 → 2392.30] But at different times.
[2393.74 → 2394.22] Sponsors!
[2394.58 → 2394.98] Sponsors!
[2396.30 → 2396.70] FreshBooks!
[2397.32 → 2399.54] Let's see how well you know your FreshBooks talking points.
[2399.60 → 2400.30] How rusty are you?
[2400.74 → 2409.06] FreshBooks is the super simple, easy to use cloud accounting service that you can use for your small business environment.
[2409.56 → 2413.86] So you can, you can enter all of your receipts.
[2413.88 → 2415.10] Oh, now I can tell you're reading.
[2415.10 → 2417.20] No, no, no, you were doing really well up until then.
[2417.22 → 2417.78] No, I wasn't.
[2417.88 → 2422.68] You can, you can, you can invoice people directly through the app, and then you can tell if they've read the invoice.
[2423.26 → 2424.52] That's something special.
[2424.70 → 2424.84] Yeah.
[2425.00 → 2426.70] Um, Colton's judging me right now.
[2426.78 → 2429.28] So I'm losing track of, uh, of my talking points.
[2429.70 → 2431.04] Uh, but essentially.
[2431.04 → 2431.66] You do like the hip thing.
[2431.74 → 2433.20] You do the hip thing when you're judging.
[2433.62 → 2435.54] You're like, you're like.
[2435.90 → 2437.14] The angry, the angry gold thing.
[2437.14 → 2437.44] No, no.
[2437.54 → 2437.68] Yeah.
[2437.68 → 2438.20] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2438.20 → 2440.56] When you're, when you stand, you stand like this.
[2440.70 → 2442.58] And when you judge, you judge like this.
[2445.46 → 2445.86] Wow.
[2445.96 → 2446.56] Yeah, I guess so.
[2446.72 → 2446.96] Okay.
[2447.18 → 2447.88] Yeah, see that?
[2448.24 → 2449.12] That right there.
[2449.32 → 2451.28] That is all the body language you need for judging.
[2451.28 → 2451.70] You know what?
[2451.76 → 2452.16] You know what?
[2452.18 → 2453.60] And you can cross the arms if you want to amp it up.
[2453.60 → 2454.72] You know what?
[2455.22 → 2459.44] In the words of a great woman, Shakira, your hips don't lie.
[2461.44 → 2464.22] Anyway, FreshBooks lets you track your expenses.
[2464.54 → 2465.86] It lets you track your hours.
[2466.32 → 2468.94] It lets you look like you're a professional.
[2469.20 → 2475.68] Even if you're like not an accounting wizard, it makes you look like you actually know what you're doing.
[2475.68 → 2478.38] And it actually makes you more organized.
[2478.38 → 2487.76] So you can spend your time fixing people's computers or teaching pottery or doing whatever it is that you do as a small business owner or a freelancer.
[2487.90 → 2491.64] Instead of drinking around with complicated accounting software.
[2492.20 → 2494.68] You could re-thread badminton rackets.
[2495.30 → 2496.16] It's called stringing.
[2497.14 → 2498.22] They're strings, not threads.
[2498.40 → 2499.48] String, thread, same thing.
[2499.48 → 2500.06] No, no, no.
[2500.06 → 2500.54] Same thing.
[2500.56 → 2501.00] Credibility?
[2501.16 → 2501.72] Same thing.
[2501.76 → 2502.22] Credibility?
[2502.54 → 2503.28] See that door right there?
[2503.40 → 2503.68] Same thing.
[2503.68 → 2504.18] It's out it.
[2504.34 → 2504.68] Same thing.
[2504.68 → 2507.02] Anyway, head over to freshbooks.com slash when.
[2507.24 → 2507.88] Give it a try.
[2508.02 → 2510.26] And they actually recently got a mobile card reader.
[2510.68 → 2514.56] So remember how I was complaining that incognito tabs weren't opening on my computer?
[2514.70 → 2514.92] No.
[2515.10 → 2516.38] Do you see they're just like popping up?
[2516.48 → 2518.02] I clicked it like 30 times.
[2518.26 → 2520.12] And they're just like popping up every once in a while.
[2520.42 → 2521.10] Bug report.
[2521.20 → 2522.86] This is Alienware quality right here.
[2522.98 → 2523.50] Bug report.
[2523.58 → 2524.58] Actually, I have no idea what these are.
[2524.58 → 2525.50] It probably just needs a reboot.
[2526.82 → 2527.40] Oh, yeah.
[2527.56 → 2529.62] I'm working on a review of the new Alienware 13.
[2529.88 → 2530.66] So that's coming soon.
[2530.78 → 2531.68] What's different about it?
[2531.86 → 2532.28] Kaby Lake.
[2534.02 → 2534.54] That's all.
[2535.68 → 2538.06] But in order to make sure that...
[2538.06 → 2538.26] Okay.
[2538.34 → 2538.90] So this is...
[2538.90 → 2539.02] Okay.
[2539.06 → 2540.36] I guess we'll split up the sponsors today.
[2540.40 → 2540.56] Okay.
[2540.68 → 2543.34] In order to make sure that I'm not...
[2543.34 → 2543.52] Okay.
[2543.56 → 2544.72] This is something I've struggled with.
[2544.80 → 2545.30] Tell me more.
[2545.60 → 2554.68] In the earlier days of the channel, I would pretty much avoid reviewing a laptop unless
[2554.68 → 2556.06] it was a new shell.
[2556.14 → 2556.44] Sure.
[2556.44 → 2558.10] So do you know what I mean by shell?
[2559.52 → 2559.88] Yeah.
[2559.88 → 2561.10] Like clams are in them, right?
[2561.60 → 2561.90] No.
[2562.40 → 2565.22] So laptops get refreshed a number of ways.
[2565.56 → 2567.36] They can get like a single...
[2567.36 → 2567.62] Okay.
[2567.70 → 2573.22] They can get a spec update where they might get like a new build out that you can do for
[2573.22 → 2573.34] it.
[2573.34 → 2575.60] For example, now available with 32 gigs of RAM.
[2575.60 → 2575.94] Yep.
[2575.94 → 2578.82] Where they haven't materially changed anything about the actual product here.
[2578.90 → 2580.16] They're just giving you different options.
[2580.72 → 2580.92] Okay.
[2580.98 → 2582.98] They can receive a...
[2582.98 → 2585.50] Like a complete internal upgrade.
[2585.72 → 2587.40] So they could get like a new motherboard.
[2587.98 → 2593.52] And in that case, you'd usually be required to build a new motherboard for like a Sky Lake
[2593.52 → 2595.78] to Kaby Lake upgrade or something along those lines.
[2596.46 → 2597.92] They can get...
[2597.92 → 2599.14] Or like a new graphics card.
[2599.32 → 2603.02] In these days, especially for thin and lights, usually requires a new motherboard because it's
[2603.02 → 2604.10] built right into the same board.
[2604.88 → 2613.40] Or you can get a shell or like a chassis upgrade where there's like a significant change to the
[2613.40 → 2615.28] I.O. or the keyboard, the screen.
[2615.68 → 2620.40] Because for us, a lot of what we review about a laptop is the usability.
[2620.40 → 2624.42] The day-to-day interaction with the device.
[2624.86 → 2625.32] And so...
[2625.32 → 2626.28] Keyboard, trackpad, display.
[2626.40 → 2626.80] That's right.
[2627.10 → 2630.76] So if the only change, like the weight, we care about things like that.
[2630.84 → 2644.14] So if the only change is that we went from a 6700 HQ to a 7700 HQ, which for all intents
[2644.14 → 2648.76] and purposes is very, very similar, then I don't have a ton to say about it other than maybe
[2648.76 → 2650.12] we got some battery life improvement.
[2650.78 → 2654.74] But in order to make sure that the piece of content that I'm making is materially different
[2654.74 → 2660.10] from last time, I had them send over their graphics accelerator external GPU thing.
[2660.74 → 2664.20] So they sent over one of those, and I'm going to tool around with that.
[2664.32 → 2667.54] And the review will really be focused on that rather than...
[2667.54 → 2669.40] And I'll make some comments on the Kaby Lake upgrade.
[2669.46 → 2670.28] But there's not much to say.
[2670.34 → 2671.24] It's still a great laptop.
[2671.36 → 2672.12] I still love it.
[2672.12 → 2674.68] But now with an external GPU.
[2675.26 → 2676.04] Quick spoiler.
[2676.38 → 2681.46] Are they certifying any brands other than Alienware for that external dock?
[2681.54 → 2681.82] No.
[2682.08 → 2684.66] So there it uses a proprietary interface.
[2684.78 → 2685.18] Oh, right.
[2685.26 → 2685.48] Yes.
[2685.48 → 2686.84] Instead of Thunderbolt.
[2687.04 → 2693.10] But what I also do want to do this time around is I want to look closer at whether the Racer
[2693.10 → 2694.50] Core will work with this.
[2694.72 → 2698.58] Because I had an experience recently on the Dell Inspiron Gaming.
[2699.10 → 2701.40] Was it the Inspired Gaming or was it something else?
[2701.54 → 2703.20] I've actually looked at a lot of Dell stuff this year.
[2703.20 → 2708.98] We finally know the right people at Dell to get laptops in so we can...
[2708.98 → 2709.08] Hi.
[2709.40 → 2709.80] Yeah.
[2710.16 → 2712.34] The XPS 2-in-1 maybe?
[2713.04 → 2713.34] Yeah.
[2713.50 → 2714.40] Yeah, that's the one it was.
[2714.46 → 2716.52] It was the XPS 13 2-in-1.
[2716.80 → 2717.12] 12?
[2717.32 → 2717.68] 13?
[2717.80 → 2718.26] Whatever it was.
[2718.66 → 2720.20] Anyway, the point is that thing.
[2721.36 → 2727.00] When I plugged in a Racer Core with an external graphics card in it, it specifically said there
[2727.00 → 2729.14] was a message that came up, blip, not supported.
[2729.14 → 2733.10] But if I just told that message to GTFO my desktop...
[2733.10 → 2733.44] Then it works.
[2733.68 → 2734.64] ...then it actually worked.
[2734.78 → 2734.92] Yeah.
[2735.06 → 2740.30] So I got scared off by that message last time I had an Alienware 13 in the shop.
[2740.32 → 2740.58] Oh, okay.
[2740.68 → 2742.50] And I never really pursued it any further.
[2742.64 → 2747.72] So what I want to know when I'm investigating this and its external graphics solution...
[2747.72 → 2748.54] How does it stack up?
[2748.56 → 2749.42] How does it stack up?
[2749.78 → 2750.94] How does the performance compare?
[2751.20 → 2751.36] Yeah.
[2751.36 → 2754.34] Because those kinds of apples to apple comparisons are lots of fun for me.
[2754.36 → 2758.22] And I know that the whole external graphics card thing is still in its infancy.
[2758.22 → 2760.34] Most people are not that interested in it right now.
[2760.56 → 2762.94] But I mean, that's where I get my jollies, right?
[2763.26 → 2768.14] Like weirdo tech that's going to be accessible three, five years from now.
[2768.40 → 2773.50] But that is really buggy and entertaining, therefore, for me to play around with on my weekends
[2773.50 → 2775.04] that I would otherwise spend with my children.
[2775.48 → 2780.90] Somebody wants you to know that Dell Inspiron is supposed to be like the word inspiration.
[2783.14 → 2783.54] Inspired?
[2783.98 → 2784.50] I don't care.
[2785.12 → 2785.48] Inspired?
[2785.86 → 2786.30] Squarespace!
[2786.30 → 2786.70] Squarespace!
[2786.94 → 2789.10] You know what Squarespace is supposed to be like?
[2789.24 → 2792.94] A great-looking website that's affordable with tons of features.
[2793.10 → 2794.60] You know what inspiration is like?
[2795.10 → 2795.58] Squarespace!
[2796.88 → 2798.30] That didn't even work.
[2798.38 → 2799.24] That wasn't even funny.
[2800.20 → 2800.98] That wasn't funny.
[2801.56 → 2803.10] Derailing your sponsor spots is funny.
[2803.84 → 2805.42] Because I don't have to deal with the fallout anymore.
[2805.84 → 2806.82] Yeah, that is funny.
[2806.82 → 2808.78] All right.
[2808.84 → 2813.06] So Squarespace lets you build a beautiful website on your terms.
[2813.12 → 2818.80] As long as your terms involve picking one of their 20 beautiful templates, rearranging all
[2818.80 → 2824.56] the text and pictures to make it say what you want it to say, and having it, boom, instantly
[2824.56 → 2829.00] be live, ready for the world to see, and be rock-solid reliable.
[2829.24 → 2831.96] Our Squarespace site has never been down.
[2832.70 → 2836.20] LinusMediaGroup.com has never been down.
[2836.44 → 2841.04] And we've been working with Squarespace for like three-plus years now?
[2841.10 → 2841.12] Yeah.
[2841.20 → 2842.16] Maybe more.
[2842.36 → 2842.54] Yeah.
[2842.62 → 2843.20] Long time.
[2843.20 → 2843.78] Since like...
[2843.78 → 2844.12] It's crazy.
[2844.12 → 2845.44] Well before we moved.
[2845.62 → 2848.10] Since like, yeah, 2014, 2013 era.
[2848.30 → 2849.94] It starts at $12 a month.
[2850.04 → 2852.42] You get a free domain if you buy Squarespace for the year.
[2852.96 → 2857.54] And every website features responsive design, so it scales to look great on any device.
[2857.74 → 2859.70] Every website comes with a free online store.
[2859.98 → 2864.02] And they've got tons of features, like their logo designer, their cover pages feature that
[2864.02 → 2868.62] lets you just have a single one-page website in like minutes.
[2869.40 → 2874.10] They've got support for Apple News formats, so you can use the blog module to publish to
[2874.10 → 2875.74] millions of potential readers.
[2876.62 → 2879.36] And yeah, I mean, what is there to say about Squarespace?
[2879.54 → 2881.44] Other than that, it really is.
[2881.80 → 2888.44] Unless you have some very specific, like really out there needs, it really is the best way
[2888.44 → 2895.00] to just get a website up, have it look and work great, and just not have to think about
[2895.00 → 2895.38] it anymore.
[2895.90 → 2898.98] So when you decide to sign up for Squarespace, they do have a free trial.
[2898.98 → 2904.14] Head over to squarespace.com slash when and use offer code when to save 10%.
[2904.14 → 2910.70] Speaking of saving 10%, you could save a lot more than 10% with our last sponsor, fixity,
[2910.82 → 2912.22] by fixing your own electronics.
[2912.38 → 2913.54] fixity's great.
[2914.00 → 2922.02] The odds, if you've ever had something that's broken, Google Pixel, Alienware computer, chair,
[2922.28 → 2923.16] no, probably not a chair.
[2923.22 → 2924.58] It's mostly focused on electronics.
[2924.58 → 2928.76] But if you've ever had something that's broken, and you've searched for a guide on how to,
[2929.40 → 2930.90] you really got to walk right in front of the camera.
[2931.54 → 2936.02] You search for a guide on how to take it apart, or how to fix it, how to replace a screen,
[2936.12 → 2938.92] how to replace a battery, you've probably encountered their website.
[2939.24 → 2944.36] But what you might not know is that aside from the beautifully written, well-pictured guides,
[2944.52 → 2948.74] or beautifully illustrated guides, they also have a complete lineup of tools, including
[2948.74 → 2953.56] everything from screwdrivers in the Protect toolkit here, to their basic toolkit.
[2953.56 → 2955.12] I forget what that one's called exactly.
[2955.12 → 2955.56] Oh crap.
[2955.56 → 2956.52] What's it called?
[2956.86 → 2958.12] Um, essentials?
[2958.54 → 2959.18] Essentials tool?
[2959.18 → 2959.84] I think that's right.
[2959.90 → 2960.18] Something like that.
[2960.18 → 2961.58] Well, we're going to call it Essentials Toolkit.
[2961.64 → 2962.18] Don't worry about it.
[2962.24 → 2962.38] Cool.
[2962.50 → 2965.80] Anyway, everything from the Protect toolkit to the Essentials Toolkit, all the way up to,
[2965.80 → 2971.06] like, the full-size bag that has this guy, the other screwdriver set, like, the little
[2971.06 → 2976.04] magnetic pad for putting screws on that uses, like, an overhead projector marker so you
[2976.04 → 2980.20] can label what everything is and where it all goes, the suction cups for moving displays.
[2980.54 → 2984.60] They've got replacement parts for things like the adhesive seals that go into certain products.
[2984.82 → 2987.56] So we used that back when we did our iMac upgrade guide.
[2987.64 → 2990.24] They've got everything, and it's all backed by a lifetime warranty.
[2991.30 → 2992.52] Oh, this is interesting.
[2992.70 → 2993.52] This is in my notes.
[2993.52 → 2994.00] Yes.
[2994.00 → 2995.16] Um, so check it out.
[2995.30 → 2999.98] Canadians can apparently get cheaper shipping on fixity products through Amazon.ca.
[3000.12 → 3001.32] So here's a fun story.
[3001.92 → 3002.12] Huh.
[3002.12 → 3007.12] A long time ago, I think it was, like, I don't even know how long, a while ago, there was
[3007.12 → 3011.10] a post on the forum where one of the forum users was like, hey, I really, really like
[3011.10 → 3012.32] the fixity Protect Toolkit.
[3012.50 → 3014.68] I really want to get one.
[3015.10 → 3018.22] I'm in Canada, and it's, like, the shipping's, like, ridiculous.
[3018.42 → 3020.70] Like, it's almost as much as the toolkit itself.
[3020.78 → 3023.50] Right, which sometimes, unless you're shipping enormous volumes.
[3023.50 → 3026.12] Sometimes that's just the reality of it.
[3026.30 → 3028.68] That's how many UPS or FedEx is charging.
[3028.96 → 3032.14] So we passed along the feedback to our fixity rep.
[3032.36 → 3037.54] And because of the Linus Tech Tips audience, Canadians now get a better deal on shipping
[3037.54 → 3040.18] because they worked out a deal with their shipment provider.
[3040.34 → 3046.42] So if you guys are in Canada, and you've been waiting to get a Protect Toolkit, you should
[3046.42 → 3048.68] go get one because the shipping is much more reasonable nowadays.
[3048.68 → 3052.10] So if you're not Canadian, head over to ifixit.com slash Linus.
[3052.58 → 3054.90] When are we going to get that vanity URL fixed?
[3055.06 → 3058.76] I've been chasing you guys to fix those vanity URLs for, like, a year.
[3059.00 → 3059.84] Hashtag blame Colton.
[3060.16 → 3061.24] Okay, let's blame Colton.
[3061.86 → 3063.16] ifixit.com slash Linus.
[3063.20 → 3068.52] Use code WINSLOW at checkout, and you can save five bucks on a purchase of $10 or more.
[3069.02 → 3069.50] fixity.
[3069.70 → 3070.60] Repair is beautiful.
[3071.00 → 3071.92] Repair it beautiful.
[3072.64 → 3073.94] What was our other sponsor?
[3074.04 → 3074.96] Can we work that in as well?
[3075.40 → 3075.80] FreshBooks.
[3076.02 → 3076.42] FreshBooks.
[3076.62 → 3078.08] And then invoice it beautiful.
[3078.36 → 3082.72] Yeah, invoice the repair job you did beautifully.
[3083.02 → 3085.64] In fact, these three sponsors could work together really well.
[3085.78 → 3088.08] Invoice the repair job you did beautifully.
[3088.08 → 3089.10] Yeah, so Squarespace site.
[3089.10 → 3089.66] Look at this.
[3090.18 → 3092.88] fixity tools and FreshBooks accounting to keep track of everything.
[3092.94 → 3093.98] This is what we do.
[3094.08 → 3096.80] This is Synergy, which is another one of our sponsors.
[3098.02 → 3099.62] Synergistic management solutions.
[3099.90 → 3100.08] Yeah.
[3101.00 → 3101.40] Synergy.
[3101.40 → 3103.08] Why do we even make YouTube videos anymore?
[3103.16 → 3103.76] We could do...
[3103.76 → 3104.08] I don't know, man.
[3104.08 → 3108.10] I've been saying we should be consultants for, like, since I started working here.
[3108.18 → 3112.88] Because consultants, as far as I can tell, just make butt loads of money doing not a lot.
[3112.90 → 3114.76] Just for telling people things that are obvious.
[3114.76 → 3115.84] Yeah, you should do this.
[3117.20 → 3118.28] $10,000, please.
[3118.62 → 3119.64] It's like, what?
[3120.72 → 3128.94] Speaking of things that you should do, you should care about the variety of AMD motherboards coming out.
[3129.06 → 3130.26] So, there it is.
[3130.26 → 3134.50] I believe that's Biostar with their racing brand.
[3135.50 → 3136.28] Yeah, Biostar.
[3136.28 → 3137.12] The racing brand.
[3137.16 → 3137.86] Yeah, I know.
[3137.94 → 3138.66] It's very racy.
[3140.12 → 3142.22] It's, like, edgy, but like the old word for it.
[3142.44 → 3142.96] I understand.
[3142.96 → 3145.10] So, here it is.
[3145.10 → 3149.30] The first AM4 motherboard pictured over on videocards.net.
[3149.64 → 3152.98] There are a few things that we can tell about it just from looking at it.
[3152.98 → 3158.84] Number one is that it appears to run off of only a four-pin connector.
[3158.84 → 3165.98] So, it is my expectation that people would be encouraged to run, like, a 1700 or less on here.
[3166.06 → 3167.18] It's like a 65-watt chip.
[3167.50 → 3170.84] Although, there's no reason that you couldn't get away with an 1800X.
[3170.90 → 3172.76] You just probably wouldn't be doing a ton of overclocking.
[3173.12 → 3175.32] There's not much in the way of VRM cooling here.
[3175.32 → 3183.20] So, this looks like not like a balls-to-the-wall, like an DOG competitor, but more like kind of a mainstream decent board.
[3184.22 → 3186.70] You got four SATA ports right there.
[3187.78 → 3190.06] No M.2 that I can see.
[3190.66 → 3194.50] That's a little discouraging unless it's on the back, which I have seen in the past.
[3194.56 → 3195.28] So, don't quote me on that.
[3195.28 → 3198.92] USB 3, PCIe 16X, two RAM slots.
[3199.22 → 3200.10] Looking pretty good.
[3200.22 → 3202.78] I mean, to be fair, they don't have much room on that board to begin with.
[3203.00 → 3203.40] Yes, that's true.
[3203.40 → 3207.04] So, they may have just been prioritizing, like, okay, we're hitting this certain budget target.
[3207.52 → 3210.82] We don't expect that people in this range are going to be buying M.2 cards yet.
[3211.08 → 3211.32] Yeah.
[3211.46 → 3212.08] You know what, though?
[3212.14 → 3217.22] This is something I really wish that AMD had done differently with AM4 is this socket.
[3217.78 → 3218.02] Yeah.
[3218.02 → 3218.90] So, two things.
[3219.00 → 3222.24] Number one is AMD has now done this.
[3225.28 → 3226.70] Three times, okay?
[3227.32 → 3232.04] So, they had their original socket 940, okay?
[3232.46 → 3237.34] Then they had socket 754, so those used a particular mounting system.
[3237.44 → 3244.10] So, it was a single screw on either side, and then it came out to, like, a plastic clip bracket thing like this.
[3244.38 → 3248.66] And the problem with that was that third-party coolers only had two anchor points, and that was kind of crappy.
[3248.88 → 3254.58] Then they fixed it with, uh, crap, I think 939 also still had this.
[3254.58 → 3258.24] So, I think it was AM2 was what the first one was called.
[3258.30 → 3258.94] Anyway, they fixed it.
[3258.98 → 3259.86] They put four posts.
[3260.58 → 3264.24] But, like, they still mount their own stock coolers with this stupid thing.
[3264.30 → 3265.76] So, I kind of went, okay, fine.
[3266.06 → 3268.16] I realize why you changed it this time.
[3268.24 → 3268.82] I get it.
[3268.94 → 3269.26] Fine.
[3269.98 → 3272.50] This time, all they did was move the hole slightly.
[3272.50 → 3283.50] So, all they've done for no apparent reason is kill backwards compatibility with old AM3, AM2, AM2 Plus coolers.
[3283.50 → 3283.82] Mm-hmm.
[3283.82 → 3288.00] And they've still got all this bulky plastic crap all over the socket.
[3288.00 → 3291.72] Like, if they had gone, and they had kind of, like, gone, okay, mounting holes here.
[3291.78 → 3296.46] Like, done something LGA 2011 style where it's just got threaded holes around the socket.
[3296.84 → 3298.16] That would have been super cool.
[3298.84 → 3301.58] I really don't like the way they did this because it takes up a lot of space.
[3301.58 → 3303.50] It moved the mounting holes.
[3303.90 → 3313.78] And all of this, as far as I can tell, was done for no reason other than to decrease compatibility with older coolers so that cooler manufacturers can sell you a new AM4 bracket or cooler.
[3314.00 → 3320.04] Like, that's the tinfoil hat guy in me kind of going, I really can't think of another reason they would have done that.
[3320.06 → 3320.74] It's not that tinfoil.
[3321.44 → 3322.52] Go back to it for a sec.
[3322.58 → 3323.90] Someone says, Linus, it's on the back.
[3323.96 → 3325.78] Look, next to audio, you can see screw holes.
[3325.78 → 3333.60] Yeah, I can see screw holes.
[3334.12 → 3334.46] Wow.
[3334.62 → 3335.70] I would never miss a screw hole.
[3337.36 → 3338.36] Next to audio.
[3338.56 → 3339.52] Yeah, not necessarily.
[3340.10 → 3350.02] So, I do see these, but those, okay, and those look like M.2 mounts, but they wouldn't actually go all the way through necessarily.
[3350.44 → 3352.68] Like, that's not what they would look like on this side.
[3352.76 → 3353.80] I don't know what that is.
[3355.78 → 3360.98] Yeah, so I didn't want to say definitively that that's what that is if I wasn't sure.
[3360.98 → 3364.18] There's a lot of people saying there is M.2 on this one, so maybe it's on the back.
[3364.26 → 3364.44] Cool.
[3364.62 → 3365.20] So, maybe it is.
[3365.30 → 3365.40] Yeah.
[3366.84 → 3367.48] That's boring.
[3368.20 → 3369.04] Is this interesting?
[3369.18 → 3371.76] Facebook streaming Major League Soccer matches?
[3371.92 → 3372.86] Does anyone care about this?
[3373.22 → 3374.64] I mean, people in the rest of the world probably do.
[3374.64 → 3375.94] Apparently, James does.
[3376.62 → 3379.32] People in, like, here's the thing.
[3379.40 → 3384.98] In Canada, if you played soccer as a kid, like, 95% of your games were rained or snowed out.
[3384.98 → 3387.68] So, like, that's why no one cares about it here.
[3389.30 → 3389.74] Aww.
[3390.62 → 3391.06] Okay.
[3391.64 → 3394.68] So, Facebook scores a deal to live stream Major League Soccer matches.
[3394.76 → 3396.92] That, and I'm pretty sure nobody cares about MLS.
[3400.22 → 3401.30] I think John does.
[3401.86 → 3405.62] Well, yeah, but John cares about every sporting league on earth.
[3405.62 → 3407.58] Like, you could, hey, John.
[3407.80 → 3408.10] Yeah.
[3408.32 → 3409.78] Do you watch professional cricket?
[3411.50 → 3411.84] No.
[3412.16 → 3412.70] Would you?
[3413.52 → 3413.78] No.
[3414.08 → 3414.66] He says no.
[3414.78 → 3415.02] Okay.
[3415.18 → 3415.72] So, okay.
[3415.72 → 3416.32] So, no cricket.
[3416.42 → 3416.70] All right.
[3416.74 → 3417.08] Never mind.
[3417.18 → 3417.78] I take it back.
[3418.74 → 3419.14] Wrong.
[3419.14 → 3419.98] But, like, okay.
[3420.94 → 3421.38] Okay.
[3421.38 → 3424.92] A sport that's interesting to Americans, though.
[3425.74 → 3431.02] I guarantee you he follows not only, like, the top league, like, the national league, but
[3431.02 → 3434.08] he follows, like, college and, like, the...
[3434.08 → 3438.58] To be fair, like, a lot of the college stuff that he follows is because he went to Duke.
[3438.74 → 3439.28] That's true.
[3439.36 → 3440.92] He follows his college specifically.
[3441.06 → 3444.06] And I think that's much of a, a much more significant thing in the States.
[3444.36 → 3444.62] Yeah.
[3444.70 → 3444.94] Oh, yeah.
[3444.98 → 3446.42] Here, that's, like, super not a thing.
[3446.42 → 3449.86] Like, I, like, I think UBC has a hockey team.
[3449.96 → 3450.92] Go Thunderbirds.
[3451.00 → 3452.36] I think that's what they're called.
[3454.52 → 3454.84] Yay.
[3455.28 → 3456.96] Let's do the, do the Thunderbird wave.
[3458.30 → 3458.80] No, no.
[3458.94 → 3459.56] That's not, no.
[3459.60 → 3461.16] You have to, you have to do the wave.
[3461.64 → 3462.52] You have to do your...
[3462.52 → 3463.38] I was doing the Thunderbird.
[3463.38 → 3464.02] In your left hand.
[3464.04 → 3465.16] This was the Thunderbird wave.
[3465.26 → 3465.66] That's a thing?
[3465.66 → 3466.16] I'm not fully in frame.
[3466.48 → 3467.76] I don't know, but I'm a bird.
[3468.16 → 3469.36] That doesn't look like a Thunderbird.
[3469.42 → 3471.26] That looks like a frickin' Nancy bird.
[3471.26 → 3472.26] Yeah, it's not a car.
[3474.26 → 3475.46] It's not a car, Linus.
[3475.46 → 3482.46] So, Facebook has secured the rights to stream at least 22 live Major League Soccer regular season matches in English in 2017,
[3482.88 → 3490.84] and to enhance the video content with various interactive elements, like Facebook-specific commentators, interactive graphics, fan Q&A, and polling features.
[3490.84 → 3507.52] Basically, the reason that the headline is, like, the nail in the TV coffin, is that the money in advertising is going to online platforms, online companies like Facebook and Google and the like,
[3507.52 → 3520.60] and it's gotten to the point where they're getting very close to being capable of buying the rights to things like broadcasting live sports.
[3520.74 → 3523.68] I don't think you guys talked about this last week, but YouTube TV.
[3523.68 → 3524.86] Yep.
[3524.86 → 3540.18] They have, I think, 40 channels that would include stuff like live sports and just broadcast television, and they've bought up the rights to this stuff, and people are saying that, yeah, TV is in massive trouble because of this.
[3540.58 → 3549.10] Because not only do they have 40 channels, it's only $35 a month compared to a cable subscription, which up here, I think, averages between $80 and $100 a month.
[3549.32 → 3549.46] Yep.
[3549.46 → 3550.04] Something like that.
[3550.04 → 3550.64] I wouldn't know.
[3550.64 → 3551.64] I've never paid for one.
[3551.80 → 3555.40] I have a bundle that's, like, really discounted.
[3555.52 → 3561.00] But, yeah, I think a standard, like, decent cable package is between $60 and $100.
[3561.70 → 3561.96] Yeah.
[3562.10 → 3571.32] So, basically, the point is, and I see Facebook as a, I see what Facebook's doing as a bigger threat than what YouTube's doing,
[3571.48 → 3579.30] where, as far as I can tell, Facebook's approach here seems to be give the content for free,
[3579.30 → 3590.94] like, spend the buckets and buckets of cash that you make by advertising to your user base, something you're already doing through other media, through other methods anyway.
[3591.16 → 3591.24] Yeah.
[3591.24 → 3593.86] Keep people on the site.
[3594.30 → 3601.08] Drive up more interaction by having this content, basically eating the cost of the content to get more data from you.
[3601.34 → 3610.48] Whereas I think YouTube is sort of in between that, where they're trying to get a more traditional subscription fee from you.
[3610.48 → 3617.24] With that said, I don't think that it's impossible that Facebook would try and get you to pay for a subscription at some point in the future either.
[3618.02 → 3620.12] Twitter did a similar thing.
[3620.48 → 3628.02] I think this was just last year with the National Football League, the NFL, where they're doing some of the games.
[3628.72 → 3630.22] And I believe it's a similar thing.
[3630.32 → 3631.60] I don't think that you have to pay.
[3631.66 → 3632.42] I haven't tried it.
[3632.42 → 3633.86] But I don't think you have to pay.
[3633.96 → 3635.42] I think they're just eating the cost on that.
[3636.82 → 3638.08] Dun, dun, dun.
[3639.50 → 3640.50] Oh, my gosh.
[3641.58 → 3643.12] Pizza Hut smart shoes.
[3643.28 → 3645.66] The original article here is from Slash Gear.
[3646.22 → 3647.66] Let's go ahead and bring that up.
[3649.30 → 3651.52] They do look amazing, by the way.
[3651.68 → 3653.30] I would wear these.
[3653.30 → 3660.28] One of the stranger wearables, entirely advertisement focused, Pizza Hut smart shoes.
[3662.88 → 3664.28] The shoes are high tops.
[3664.38 → 3665.76] They refer to them as pie tops.
[3665.96 → 3667.66] Only 64 pairs are being made.
[3668.40 → 3673.54] All the pairs will be given to the media and individuals considered to be influencers.
[3673.76 → 3674.56] Can we get some?
[3674.56 → 3675.04] Can we get one?
[3675.16 → 3675.74] I want one.
[3676.40 → 3680.06] We actually have a piece of content planned soon called wearables that aren't crap.
[3681.38 → 3682.84] Although I don't necessarily.
[3682.84 → 3683.16] Okay.
[3683.58 → 3687.26] I don't want to burn bridges with Pizza Hut as a potential future sponsor.
[3688.36 → 3690.40] But if I had to eat pizza.
[3691.14 → 3692.54] It would not be your first choice.
[3692.58 → 3693.90] It would not be my first choice.
[3694.34 → 3695.98] It wouldn't be my second choice.
[3696.90 → 3698.62] It would not be my third choice.
[3698.70 → 3700.50] To be fair, we have some perfect pizza joints around here.
[3700.50 → 3702.58] It wouldn't be my chain choice.
[3704.16 → 3706.22] To be fair, we have some perfect pizza joints.
[3706.30 → 3707.20] And Pan ago's a thing.
[3707.56 → 3708.36] Pan ago's a thing.
[3708.56 → 3709.08] So anyway.
[3709.30 → 3711.02] We need to get Pan ago as a sponsor.
[3711.14 → 3711.68] Yeah, good luck.
[3711.68 → 3714.72] Aren't they like only Western Canada?
[3715.14 → 3715.42] Really?
[3715.60 → 3716.08] Is that right?
[3716.28 → 3716.44] Yeah.
[3716.58 → 3717.68] I assume they were like.
[3717.68 → 3719.36] I think they're just BC and Alberta.
[3720.30 → 3720.66] Oh.
[3720.80 → 3721.32] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3721.78 → 3723.58] Like we had a buddy who moved out here for school.
[3723.76 → 3724.12] Interesting.
[3724.12 → 3725.42] Ate Pan ago all the time.
[3725.56 → 3725.98] Loved it.
[3726.14 → 3727.06] Moved back to Ontario.
[3727.40 → 3729.04] And now he's like, dude, I wish I had Pan ago.
[3729.38 → 3729.58] Yeah.
[3729.66 → 3731.18] Like it's still chain pizza.
[3731.48 → 3732.18] Like it's not.
[3732.92 → 3734.50] What's that perfect local one?
[3735.30 → 3735.70] Jim's.
[3735.76 → 3737.64] Oh, Jim's Pizza is so good.
[3737.66 → 3738.40] Yeah, it's so good.
[3738.42 → 3739.36] It's not Jim's Pizza.
[3739.62 → 3740.48] Of which there are like.
[3740.54 → 3741.24] There's like two.
[3741.40 → 3741.58] Yeah.
[3741.58 → 3743.38] There are two locations in Langley.
[3743.60 → 3744.54] And they're both in Langley.
[3744.92 → 3745.10] Yeah.
[3745.10 → 3746.96] So go screw yourself if you want Jim's Pizza.
[3746.96 → 3748.88] If you're in Langley, you should eat Jim's Pizza.
[3749.12 → 3751.24] And I'm not talking Langley, Virginia, okay?
[3751.66 → 3752.56] Oh, dang.
[3752.80 → 3753.16] Sorry.
[3753.76 → 3754.36] Langley, British Columbia.
[3754.36 → 3755.28] Sorry, CIA.
[3755.66 → 3755.88] Yeah.
[3755.94 → 3756.80] We know you're listening.
[3758.70 → 3759.76] That's funny.
[3760.26 → 3762.48] You made up for the not funny thing you did earlier.
[3762.68 → 3763.86] Because that was very funny.
[3765.42 → 3771.10] So the shoes themselves don't do the ordering, but rather connect with a special Pie Tops app
[3771.10 → 3773.20] to place a pre-designated order.
[3773.98 → 3775.38] And you just press a button.
[3775.58 → 3778.98] Whether you can accidentally order a pizza if you cross your ankles remains to be seen.
[3782.92 → 3783.36] Great.
[3784.32 → 3784.76] Okay.
[3784.76 → 3788.16] So this was originally posted on the forum by Cloaked.
[3788.16 → 3792.24] And this is ridiculous.
[3792.24 → 3793.00] This is the Hangouts thing?
[3793.40 → 3793.58] Yeah.
[3793.70 → 3795.16] So Google is...
[3796.62 → 3797.80] Oh, man.
[3797.92 → 3798.16] This is just...
[3798.70 → 3800.64] This is just terrible.
[3800.80 → 3802.92] So the original article here is from Android Police.
[3803.44 → 3807.86] Google officially splits Hangouts into Meet and Chat.
[3808.62 → 3809.56] New apps.
[3809.56 → 3809.82] Wait, what?
[3810.12 → 3812.00] New apps, Meet, and Chat.
[3813.68 → 3814.24] Why?
[3816.24 → 3816.84] Why?
[3816.84 → 3818.54] Oh, why?
[3819.98 → 3820.42] Wow.
[3820.48 → 3821.24] This seems awful.
[3821.90 → 3822.24] Yeah.
[3822.48 → 3823.26] It really does.
[3823.26 → 3826.94] So it's literally just Hangouts video and Hangouts text chat.
[3827.28 → 3827.78] Except...
[3827.78 → 3829.10] Now you need two apps.
[3832.40 → 3832.98] Like...
[3832.98 → 3834.60] Holy...
[3834.60 → 3836.02] Actual crap.
[3836.46 → 3837.64] And this is great.
[3837.64 → 3841.40] So Cloaked actually did a wonderful job of this news post.
[3841.60 → 3844.72] Doing a good job of putting quotes from the original article.
[3844.92 → 3846.56] A perfect link to the original article.
[3846.92 → 3849.54] And his or her own feedback.
[3849.98 → 3852.84] As well as going and searching out this tweet.
[3855.84 → 3856.24] From...
[3856.24 → 3861.72] So Halloween, Harrison Hopkins, sent a message to Justin Bernini.
[3862.80 → 3863.78] Justin Uberti.
[3864.16 → 3864.46] Sorry.
[3865.76 → 3866.40] Hold on.
[3866.44 → 3866.68] Where is it?
[3866.70 → 3867.02] There we go.
[3867.06 → 3867.42] Here we go.
[3867.96 → 3870.02] So Principal Engineer, Google.
[3870.28 → 3871.62] Technical Lead for Duo.
[3872.08 → 3873.30] Co-lead for Aloe.
[3873.30 → 3875.46] So basically the guy in charge.
[3876.82 → 3879.28] So you want us to use four apps to talk to people.
[3879.62 → 3882.16] Aloe, Duo, Google Messenger, phone.
[3883.00 → 3885.48] The point stands all-in-one apps are not the few.
[3886.22 → 3886.86] What?
[3886.86 → 3892.86] So you think...
[3893.86 → 3895.26] Have you ever used...
[3895.26 → 3898.40] Justin, have you ever used an Android device?
[3899.14 → 3911.52] Have you ever experienced your pocket being on fire because some bullshit Android app is sucking battery for no apparent reason in the background?
[3911.52 → 3918.52] Do you have any idea how hard I try to install fewer things on my Android device in particular?
[3918.76 → 3924.00] Because I am so tired of being like, my phone's running really hot.
[3924.52 → 3926.90] What do I have to force close today?
[3928.12 → 3928.62] No.
[3929.34 → 3931.02] More apps is not the future.
[3931.52 → 3932.26] At all.
[3932.78 → 3937.42] If it doesn't fit on a single home screen, it is not going on my phone.
[3937.80 → 3940.58] We actually use Hangouts predominantly.
[3940.58 → 3944.32] Here at work as our internal messaging chat.
[3944.56 → 3947.30] The reason for it is that it actually does work.
[3947.38 → 3947.90] It's easy.
[3948.06 → 3948.66] Pretty great.
[3948.92 → 3949.94] It's cross-platform.
[3950.20 → 3952.46] It's a single thing that works across Mac.
[3953.72 → 3956.54] PC, Android, iOS, everything.
[3956.78 → 3965.18] If you message someone who works here on Hangouts, the odds of them seeing it in a timely manner is pretty good.
[3965.18 → 3980.78] How could you possibly think that instead of just having a button for a voice call, a button for a video call, and a text box for a text message?
[3980.78 → 3986.84] How could you possibly think that opening up a different app is a better idea?
[3986.84 → 3998.14] Hangouts Meet is video conferencing with the goal of making online meetings as painless as possible.
[3998.20 → 3998.88] It's fired up.
[3998.88 → 4002.02] Meetings can be started simply by sharing a link.
[4002.74 → 4006.12] No fiddling around with logins, plugins, or native applications.
[4006.94 → 4008.04] Up to 30 participants.
[4008.04 → 4019.38] Basically, you can have a dedicated dial-in number if you're a G Suite Enterprise customer, which we aren't because they introduced G Suite Enterprise after we bought our subscription service.
[4019.46 → 4020.70] They're like, oh yeah, G Suite Enterprise.
[4020.90 → 4023.22] It's ever so slightly different and better.
[4023.80 → 4024.86] It's going to cost twice as much.
[4024.98 → 4025.72] Screw that.
[4026.08 → 4026.64] Screw that.
[4027.02 → 4028.00] Screw Hangouts Meet.
[4028.52 → 4035.76] This is stupid because there's nothing here that Hangouts Meet does that Hangouts doesn't already do just fine or that couldn't easily have been added.
[4035.76 → 4039.50] You can already send someone a link to a hangout and they can join.
[4040.48 → 4046.18] Hangouts Chat is apparently going to be more like Slack or Microsoft Teams than previous Hangouts.
[4046.68 → 4054.64] Supports multiple virtual rooms for each topic, threaded conversations, integration with other G Suite services, and a filterable search.
[4055.40 → 4064.32] So it's going to be yet another thing that because Google can't make up their freaking mind and stay behind a communication application,
[4064.32 → 4066.28] yet another thing that's garbage.
[4066.48 → 4067.56] You know what else is garbage?
[4068.70 → 4072.32] The Google SMS app that comes built into Android.
[4072.62 → 4073.58] You know why it's garbage?
[4073.88 → 4076.82] Because when you switch to another Android device, it doesn't sync.
[4078.26 → 4079.08] That's garbage.
[4079.46 → 4083.46] I thought the whole point of Google was backing up all your crap.
[4083.66 → 4084.68] You know what else is stupid?
[4085.04 → 4090.92] The fact that when you back up an Android phone and restore another one, it doesn't back up your home screen shortcuts.
[4090.92 → 4097.66] That to me is just fundamental stuff that for some reason Google can't clue in that people need.
[4097.90 → 4099.32] You know what else is garbage while I had it?
[4099.32 → 4099.44] Tell them.
[4100.36 → 4101.16] Shut up.
[4101.50 → 4102.36] What's that called?
[4102.52 → 4104.40] You were explaining this to me the other day.
[4104.40 → 4104.62] What do you mean?
[4104.90 → 4107.00] The guy in the rap song that's just like, yeah.
[4107.00 → 4108.10] I was like, hype man.
[4109.24 → 4110.62] Okay, get out of here, hype man.
[4110.64 → 4111.10] Tell them.
[4111.62 → 4111.90] Okay.
[4112.06 → 4113.00] You know what else is garbage?
[4113.06 → 4113.54] Go in.
[4113.54 → 4116.06] The contacts' app.
[4116.18 → 4117.68] I'm even moving my hands like this.
[4118.02 → 4119.12] The contacts' app.
[4119.72 → 4123.02] You can't have multiple people for a single contact.
[4123.42 → 4128.54] How am I supposed to enter my grandma and grandpa, who by the way do not have individual cell phones.
[4129.00 → 4132.22] How am I supposed to enter my grandma and grandpa as a contact?
[4133.06 → 4133.42] Okay?
[4135.20 → 4135.80] Tell them.
[4137.24 → 4137.60] Okay.
[4137.76 → 4138.62] Well, I'm angry now.
[4138.94 → 4139.58] You know what's kind of funny?
[4139.60 → 4140.38] Actually, I'm kind of over it.
[4140.40 → 4141.48] I kind of got it out of my system.
[4141.62 → 4142.24] You know what's kind of funny?
[4142.24 → 4147.90] This is like showing a very big difference between Google and Amazon, two of the giants in the U.S. right now,
[4147.96 → 4151.66] where Google is trying to separate everything and segment everything,
[4151.92 → 4156.74] and Amazon through Twitch is trying to integrate everything into one vertical.
[4156.88 → 4160.04] I think integration is the way forward.
[4160.42 → 4160.88] I agree.
[4161.44 → 4169.58] But that's fascinating to see these two different approaches in an overall vision for how the future of technology is going.
[4169.58 → 4172.92] But, you know, that's just my opinion.
[4172.94 → 4174.40] I've always wanted a rant channel.
[4174.48 → 4175.68] People are like, this should be a video.
[4175.92 → 4177.90] I would love to have a rant channel.
[4178.02 → 4182.40] It's just something that doesn't make sense for Linus Media Group's current direction.
[4183.74 → 4184.14] Currently.
[4184.44 → 4184.82] Currently.
[4185.04 → 4185.42] We'll see.
[4185.42 → 4190.32] Nintendo Switch sales are apparently absolutely crushing it.
[4190.74 → 4195.24] Engadget says the Switch is the fastest selling console in Nintendo history,
[4195.24 → 4199.02] with Zelda being the best-selling launch title the company's ever seen,
[4199.40 → 4204.84] which is sort of taken for granted given that they didn't ship it with a game,
[4205.20 → 4207.82] and it's the only game for the console.
[4207.92 → 4209.48] So if it's going to be the fastest selling console,
[4209.54 → 4211.22] it's going to have to be the best-selling launch title.
[4211.76 → 4215.88] Well, I wonder if they're factoring in Wii U Breath of the Wild sales.
[4216.48 → 4217.44] Oh, actually, I'm not sure.
[4219.18 → 4220.84] Beating out Mario 64, though.
[4220.90 → 4222.74] So best-selling standalone launch title.
[4222.88 → 4223.68] Wow, that's fantastic.
[4223.86 → 4227.86] You know, I've never, I have tried multiple times to get into Mario 64.
[4228.08 → 4229.02] Never managed to do it.
[4229.24 → 4229.48] Really?
[4229.68 → 4229.94] Yeah.
[4230.06 → 4230.74] Oh, it's a great game.
[4230.88 → 4232.18] Just never managed to do it.
[4232.28 → 4232.64] Great game.
[4233.40 → 4234.88] I should try again at some point.
[4234.96 → 4236.66] I own it on virtual console on my Wii.
[4236.66 → 4238.88] So I just need to, like, go play it.
[4238.88 → 4240.76] You should get Little Man involved.
[4241.02 → 4241.24] Yeah.
[4242.22 → 4243.16] Well, no, I'm, okay.
[4243.34 → 4245.14] Once you graduate him to the 64.
[4245.34 → 4249.08] First game I'm going to play with him is going to be Final Fantasy VI.
[4249.36 → 4250.86] My favourite game of all time.
[4251.18 → 4251.42] Okay.
[4251.70 → 4252.50] And you know what?
[4252.54 → 4253.38] He's getting really close.
[4253.90 → 4254.52] Kid can read.
[4255.30 → 4256.44] So, like, yeah.
[4256.72 → 4261.44] So that doesn't mean he can understand the weird winding path of a Final Fantasy game.
[4261.68 → 4263.14] No, but VI is a lot less.
[4263.14 → 4266.38] I don't even understand the weird winding path of a Final Fantasy game.
[4266.38 → 4267.56] It's less weird, okay?
[4267.72 → 4269.50] It's not entirely not weird.
[4269.64 → 4270.80] It's just it's a lot less weird.
[4271.02 → 4271.16] All right.
[4272.20 → 4273.32] Way to be in the shot.
[4274.26 → 4274.94] Come on.
[4276.16 → 4281.08] See, she's not past her probation yet, which means technically she's not supposed to be on camera.
[4281.34 → 4285.96] Well, I mean, she did drop the very famously drop the.
[4285.96 → 4286.36] Oh, yeah.
[4286.50 → 4287.24] Oh, hey, Max.
[4287.30 → 4287.90] Max, come on.
[4287.90 → 4288.92] Can I borrow you for a sec?
[4288.92 → 4289.10] Come on.
[4289.22 → 4289.44] Come on.
[4289.44 → 4291.06] Come on over here for a sec.
[4291.24 → 4291.72] Come on.
[4291.72 → 4292.14] Have a seat.
[4292.26 → 4292.62] Come on in.
[4292.74 → 4293.32] Have a seat.
[4293.52 → 4294.06] Have a seat.
[4294.68 → 4295.14] Come on in.
[4295.60 → 4300.00] So we've had some of our viewers accusing us of the.
[4300.46 → 4300.86] Of faking.
[4301.04 → 4302.44] Of faking or staging.
[4303.08 → 4303.46] The drop.
[4303.48 → 4305.24] The drop of the Ry zen test bench.
[4305.26 → 4306.56] You're right behind the microphone, by the way.
[4306.58 → 4307.06] Yeah, on purpose.
[4307.06 → 4312.60] So, Max, can you tell me, did you stage that for comedic effect?
[4312.78 → 4318.38] What was the objective when you dropped the test bench there?
[4318.48 → 4323.52] I don't know why I would stage anything for comedic effect like that.
[4323.70 → 4326.72] I think the stream of despair was comedy enough.
[4327.58 → 4328.06] No!
[4329.44 → 4331.96] Okay, this has been so fun.
[4333.26 → 4333.78] All right.
[4333.82 → 4334.28] Thanks, Max.
[4334.38 → 4334.58] Bye.
[4334.58 → 4335.10] Thanks, Max.
[4335.18 → 4335.48] Bye.
[4335.48 → 4337.80] Okay, so the way it went down was.
[4337.80 → 4338.02] No!
[4339.26 → 4345.56] Against the advice of Brandon and Max, I propped up the test bench like that.
[4346.24 → 4347.36] You did that?
[4347.44 → 4348.18] Yeah, I propped it up.
[4348.24 → 4348.66] Oh, my God.
[4348.66 → 4352.14] Knowing that I would be standing right next to it to catch it.
[4352.84 → 4354.44] The doorbell rang.
[4355.02 → 4356.46] Tyler wasn't in the warehouse.
[4357.02 → 4359.40] And I was like, oh, I'll grab the door.
[4359.56 → 4361.86] Max, Max, can you keep an eye on that?
[4361.86 → 4363.04] She's like, yeah, I'll watch it.
[4363.04 → 4366.02] So she's standing there like this.
[4366.56 → 4369.08] And she kind of goes, it's not moving at all.
[4369.74 → 4371.82] And, oh, shoot, I left the camera on.
[4371.92 → 4373.02] I'll go turn off the camera.
[4373.70 → 4377.02] Before she even made it to the camera, which is why the camera was still rolling.
[4377.28 → 4380.76] Before she even made it to the camera, it started to fall.
[4380.76 → 4384.16] So that's why you saw her like dashing over there trying to get it.
[4384.50 → 4385.62] That's how it went down.
[4385.86 → 4386.96] It was not the intent.
[4387.24 → 4391.56] Although what I will say is that mostly everything survived.
[4391.96 → 4393.84] The Titan XP is fine, which is great.
[4393.92 → 4394.64] The RAM is fine.
[4394.90 → 4395.60] The chip is fine.
[4395.60 → 4396.82] The chip is fine.
[4396.90 → 4397.98] Our 1800X is fine.
[4398.22 → 4402.64] The only things that died are the cooler, which got super bent.
[4402.64 → 4406.38] And, hey, actually, hey, Max, where's that cooler?
[4406.48 → 4406.90] Do you know?
[4409.32 → 4411.00] Okay, we should Instagram it.
[4413.48 → 4416.06] Anthony, if you know where that cooler is, can you bring it over here?
[4416.46 → 4416.70] Yeah.
[4416.84 → 4419.72] So the cooler died and our crosshair six died.
[4419.86 → 4420.84] So the board died.
[4421.70 → 4423.22] Does the board have physical damage?
[4423.50 → 4423.82] Oh, yeah.
[4424.32 → 4424.62] Oh, yeah.
[4424.64 → 4425.00] It was like, oh.
[4425.00 → 4426.08] Can you bring the board?
[4426.28 → 4427.58] No, I bent it back already.
[4427.78 → 4428.30] Oh, oh, oh.
[4428.38 → 4428.94] Never mind.
[4428.94 → 4431.30] Yeah, so it was like bent.
[4431.40 → 4432.02] It was like bowed.
[4432.38 → 4432.98] Oh, man.
[4433.16 → 4435.88] Because it fell down directly onto the cooler.
[4436.06 → 4437.30] And got like 50 million views.
[4437.66 → 4438.58] Yeah, probably.
[4438.96 → 4440.66] But, like, I don't think about that.
[4440.68 → 4440.86] Yeah, yeah.
[4440.88 → 4441.10] Thanks.
[4441.10 → 4441.44] Yeah, yeah.
[4441.48 → 4442.00] Here, can I?
[4442.32 → 4444.40] I don't think about that stuff, like destruction videos.
[4444.40 → 4445.60] No, not at the moment.
[4446.36 → 4448.96] That's like, there was one video recently where you were like.
[4449.24 → 4450.08] Wait, this one's fine.
[4450.24 → 4450.62] Oh, no.
[4450.78 → 4452.12] Oh, never mind.
[4452.82 → 4453.56] That's not fine.
[4453.98 → 4454.84] Nothing is fine.
[4455.48 → 4458.92] Is this already, like, reconciled, removed from inventory, marked dead, all that stuff?
[4459.18 → 4461.08] I believe so, but I'm going to have glass now.
[4461.08 → 4461.40] Okay.
[4462.02 → 4462.30] So.
[4462.46 → 4463.06] That's like in that.
[4463.16 → 4467.98] There was a video recently where you were like, you can tell when there's a problem, and then when there's a problem.
[4469.10 → 4470.62] And that was a problem.
[4470.96 → 4472.54] So, see, it looks kind of okay from here.
[4472.58 → 4474.94] You got a couple bent fins, and then you turn it to the side.
[4475.58 → 4475.98] Oops.
[4476.16 → 4476.54] Oh, no.
[4476.82 → 4479.12] So, that's the angle that the.
[4480.16 → 4482.22] So, those heat pipes are bent AF.
[4483.12 → 4488.80] I, it kills me to damage a Noctua cooler, because it's like the bee's knees, but yeah, it's dead.
[4488.98 → 4489.14] Eh.
[4489.48 → 4490.00] It's dead.
[4490.12 → 4490.52] It's dead.
[4490.62 → 4491.84] Fans survived, so there's that.
[4493.68 → 4494.84] Were they LTT fans?
[4495.94 → 4496.26] No.
[4496.42 → 4497.72] No, it was just a normal brown one.
[4497.80 → 4498.36] Then who cares?
[4499.36 → 4499.76] Um.
[4500.28 → 4501.36] What else we got here?
[4501.36 → 4501.84] Oh, yeah.
[4501.94 → 4505.24] Microsoft is launching an Xbox subscription gaming service.
[4505.38 → 4509.10] This is different from the other Xbox subscription gaming service.
[4509.10 → 4515.52] So, this is like playing games online as, okay, so this is streaming games online.
[4516.42 → 4520.12] Okay, it is getting really hard to describe online gaming services.
[4520.38 → 4520.50] Yes.
[4520.70 → 4527.64] Because you stream a game that is being played on a server far away, being processed on a server far away.
[4528.06 → 4529.54] Yeah, like, why don't we have a word for that?
[4530.30 → 4531.92] Um, I don't, well, we do.
[4531.98 → 4534.64] It's called game streaming, but unfortunately, that could mean almost anything.
[4534.64 → 4540.88] Yeah, but like, game streaming is the same, as, is perceived the same as streaming a game.
[4541.08 → 4541.38] Yes.
[4541.56 → 4543.84] So, like, why don't we have like a separate word for it?
[4543.86 → 4545.66] We could call it, we could call it gaming on demand.
[4545.86 → 4546.70] We should coin a term.
[4546.72 → 4547.52] Yeah, on demand gaming.
[4547.90 → 4548.66] No, that's stupid.
[4549.00 → 4550.28] Well, that's what it's called, though.
[4550.64 → 4552.04] We should call it bur blogging.
[4552.34 → 4553.12] No, that's stupid.
[4553.50 → 4553.78] No.
[4553.90 → 4555.10] No, that's stupid and not funny.
[4555.22 → 4555.88] So, you're now what?
[4555.96 → 4556.18] What?
[4556.34 → 4557.04] You're minus one.
[4557.18 → 4557.92] Dude, I don't even.
[4557.92 → 4560.56] You were, you had pulled even, and now you're minus one.
[4560.60 → 4561.60] What happened to you, man?
[4561.64 → 4562.66] You used to be cool.
[4562.88 → 4563.82] No, I didn't.
[4563.82 → 4564.18] I didn't know.
[4564.18 → 4564.80] That's accurate.
[4564.86 → 4570.84] Coming this spring to the Xbox One, the Xbox Game Pass will give console owners access
[4570.84 → 4573.80] to over 100 Xbox One and backwards compatible games.
[4573.80 → 4574.14] Cloud gaming.
[4574.38 → 4575.50] For $9.99 a month.
[4575.58 → 4576.20] Yeah, cloud gaming.
[4576.42 → 4577.14] Thank you, Twitch chat.
[4577.58 → 4578.38] It is part of the cloud.
[4579.06 → 4579.66] What if it's not?
[4579.74 → 4582.14] So, initial supported titles include Halo 5 Guardians.
[4582.14 → 4583.96] Did anyone care about Halo 5 Guardians?
[4584.60 → 4586.28] NBA 2K16.
[4586.28 → 4589.66] I think people cared about Halo 5 because it was supposed to be, like, the return of Halo
[4589.66 → 4592.24] to PC, but then the PC version is total garbage.
[4592.68 → 4593.56] Soul Cali bur 2.
[4594.38 → 4595.22] Soul Cali bur 2?
[4595.60 → 4597.04] I played that when I was, like, 12.
[4598.08 → 4598.32] Huh.
[4598.40 → 4599.48] How old is that game?
[4600.02 → 4600.26] Yeah.
[4600.34 → 4601.78] When did Soul Cali bur 2 come out?
[4603.56 → 4603.94] Wow.
[4604.04 → 4606.78] Soul Cali bur 6 was one of the autocompletes on...
[4606.78 → 4606.82] Wow.
[4606.82 → 4608.70] Whoa.
[4608.70 → 4608.90] Whoa.
[4609.90 → 4612.74] It is the sequel to Soul Cali bur, which was released in 98.
[4613.16 → 4613.60] 2003.
[4613.60 → 4614.22] And it came out...
[4614.22 → 4614.52] No, no.
[4614.56 → 4614.86] Hold on.
[4614.90 → 4615.18] Hold on.
[4615.18 → 4615.24] Hold on.
[4615.46 → 4621.38] The game was released on the NAMC System 246 arcade board before being ported to the
[4621.38 → 4624.20] PlayStation 2, Game Cube, and Xbox in 2003.
[4624.20 → 4624.60] Wow.
[4625.86 → 4630.50] They're really bringing their A-game there, that A-game there.
[4630.50 → 4631.82] Great game library.
[4632.42 → 4632.94] Yes.
[4632.94 → 4633.82] Um...
[4633.82 → 4638.02] So, partners providing at least some supports include Take-Two, Warner Bros. Capcom, Banzai,
[4638.06 → 4638.94] and Microsoft Studios.
[4639.22 → 4642.18] If Microsoft Studios wasn't providing support, then...
[4642.18 → 4646.70] EA is apparently a holdout because they offer access to their Xbox One titles through a $30
[4646.70 → 4648.84] per year subscription called EA Access.
[4649.10 → 4649.58] Sweet.
[4650.16 → 4653.16] GameStop shares apparently fell 7.8% on the announcement.
[4653.40 → 4653.96] I mean, can...
[4653.96 → 4655.82] Who's still investing GameStop?
[4655.82 → 4656.04] Yeah.
[4656.32 → 4657.76] Why is GameStop still a thing?
[4657.82 → 4657.98] Okay.
[4658.06 → 4661.14] So, the point of investing is that you expect growth.
[4661.82 → 4669.18] So, even if you still believe that GameStop has, like, games to rent to people or sell to
[4669.18 → 4673.84] people or whatever, surely you couldn't be expecting it to grow that business.
[4673.84 → 4677.86] Well, that's why it fell, was that there was less demand.
[4677.96 → 4680.74] Yeah, but, like, who still has their money in GameStop?
[4681.02 → 4685.80] Anyone who's watching right now, take your investment dollars out of GameStop.
[4685.96 → 4686.66] Dude, we don't...
[4686.66 → 4692.70] We do not certify this investment advice as advice by a financial advisor.
[4693.06 → 4698.30] Please consult your financial advisor before making any financial decisions and determinations.
[4698.54 → 4698.64] Okay.
[4698.64 → 4703.46] Consult your financial advisor before ripping all of your money out of your GameStop.
[4703.84 → 4708.18] GameStop stock portfolio and investing it in almost anything else.
[4708.18 → 4708.28] You know what?
[4708.40 → 4713.20] I'm going to go buy GameStop stock and then when they come out with, like, the next big
[4713.20 → 4713.60] thing...
[4713.60 → 4715.32] The next big GameStop thing.
[4715.32 → 4719.96] I'm just going to roll up in my Lamborghini and laugh at you in this piddly little office
[4719.96 → 4720.84] that we've got going...
[4720.84 → 4721.46] No, I'm just kidding.
[4722.74 → 4723.52] That's, you know...
[4723.52 → 4724.34] Yeah, good luck with that.
[4724.44 → 4725.08] Thanks, man.
[4725.44 → 4725.88] Scientists!
[4726.72 → 4727.92] Scientists are so cool.
[4727.92 → 4729.92] They have stored a movie...
[4729.92 → 4731.16] Scientists are cool.
[4731.30 → 4737.74] ...an operating system and an Amazon gift card in a single speck of DNA.
[4737.90 → 4741.24] So the original article here is from sciencealert.com.
[4741.80 → 4742.84] There you have it.
[4742.98 → 4748.02] The highest density data storage device ever created.
[4749.28 → 4750.00] I mean...
[4750.00 → 4750.60] Number one.
[4750.60 → 4753.98] Bear in mind, of course, that this doesn't necessarily mean anything.
[4754.16 → 4759.60] I mean, you could store a movie at, like, a super low bit rate and the computer OS could
[4759.60 → 4760.20] be anything.
[4760.44 → 4761.34] But this is DNA.
[4761.68 → 4762.08] I know.
[4762.24 → 4762.90] It's still cool.
[4763.10 → 4763.46] DNA!
[4763.74 → 4765.14] It's stored stuff in DNA before.
[4765.28 → 4766.02] I just mean...
[4766.02 → 4766.46] Like...
[4766.46 → 4767.38] Saying, like...
[4767.38 → 4768.52] But, like...
[4768.52 → 4768.74] Okay.
[4769.10 → 4774.16] Saying a hard drive can hold a billion movies doesn't tell you anything about the quality
[4774.16 → 4775.26] that it's stored...
[4775.26 → 4780.10] Like, you have to say its Blu-ray quality, or you have to say, you know, whatever else.
[4780.10 → 4781.24] Yes, I understand what you're saying.
[4781.34 → 4788.70] Anyway, this DNA encoding method approaches the theoretical maximum for information stored
[4788.70 → 4789.78] per nucleotide.
[4789.86 → 4795.20] They were able to recover the stored files with zero errors and their strategy is capable
[4795.20 → 4800.48] of recording 215 petabytes of data on a single gram of DNA.
[4801.20 → 4803.20] No, I was reading there was...
[4803.20 → 4808.98] The day that this research was announced, there was an AMA with, like, the lead scientist or
[4808.98 → 4809.84] lead researcher, whatever it is.
[4809.84 → 4810.60] Lead cool guy!
[4810.72 → 4811.52] That's what we're going to go with.
[4811.52 → 4811.72] Essentially.
[4811.88 → 4813.16] The lead dope guy.
[4813.28 → 4813.50] Yeah.
[4814.94 → 4815.26] And...
[4815.26 → 4816.42] Dope AF lit guy.
[4816.60 → 4820.72] There were a bunch of questions about, you know, doesn't store on DNA make it, you
[4820.72 → 4824.92] know, subject to environmental factors, and wouldn't it be difficult to store?
[4825.52 → 4831.72] And apparently there are, you know, relatively low-cost solutions and even stuff like gigantic
[4831.72 → 4835.80] server rooms could be relatively easily converted.
[4836.00 → 4837.50] This is, you know...
[4838.16 → 4838.92] Ten years out.
[4839.44 → 4843.20] Long time away and this is all just stuff that I read on the AMA.
[4843.76 → 4849.62] But server rooms could be relatively easily transformed into areas that could store this
[4849.62 → 4853.30] stuff safely with a half-life of, like, 4,000 years.
[4855.38 → 4862.38] Which is, like, way longer than any other physical medium we've come across so far.
[4862.86 → 4867.64] So that, I think, is the really exciting part is that this could be, like, an incredible
[4867.64 → 4869.98] long-term storage aspect.
[4869.98 → 4875.42] Sorry, I moved on to the zombie-proof 3D printed mobile house.
[4877.02 → 4882.10] So the researcher spent seven grand to synthesize the DNA and another 2,000 to sequence it.
[4882.66 → 4886.66] So, yeah, costs need to come down a fair bit, but very cool.
[4887.62 → 4888.36] Zombie house.
[4889.12 → 4889.48] Yeah.
[4889.94 → 4893.28] So the original article here is from TechCrunch.
[4893.92 → 4898.30] Passive DOM is a zombie-proof autonomous 3D printed mobile house.
[4899.98 → 4903.78] Apparently it's very efficient compared to brick.
[4904.20 → 4907.94] It could be made off-grid in a cold climate with some upgrades.
[4908.24 → 4911.74] So without, like, a complex and expensive engineered heating solution.
[4912.36 → 4915.54] The frame is made of 3D printed carbon fibre and fibreglass.
[4915.68 → 4917.26] The entire house is recyclable.
[4917.80 → 4922.76] It's 36 square meters and costs 60,000 euro to pre-order.
[4923.56 → 4928.02] They have a special zombie apocalypse package that includes armoured glazing, an alarm system,
[4928.02 → 4930.28] extra toilet paper storage, and a Bible.
[4933.40 → 4938.04] So while this all could be nonsense, it seems they actually have a real model built already,
[4938.12 → 4939.78] and all the technology is somewhat feasible.
[4940.44 → 4941.80] So there you have it.
[4942.02 → 4942.36] There's that.
[4942.36 → 4943.58] That's such a...
[4943.58 → 4944.06] Wow.
[4945.40 → 4945.88] Interesting.
[4947.24 → 4949.40] Yeah, I guess that's pretty much it for me.
[4949.40 → 4954.48] Chad is telling us that we should, instead of doing, like, tape storage for long term,
[4954.58 → 4956.36] we should do DNA storage.
[4956.62 → 4958.42] Yeah, we'll just, like, get right on that.
[4958.50 → 4964.34] We'll just build out, like, our DNA research lab and, you know, the next unit over.
[4964.40 → 4965.00] No problem.
[4965.20 → 4965.82] We got this.
[4966.28 → 4967.04] 100% down.
[4967.42 → 4968.00] All right.
[4968.38 → 4969.78] That would be some videos right there.
[4970.68 → 4972.32] Well, that's, I guess...
[4972.32 → 4973.94] How's your week been, Linus?
[4973.96 → 4974.70] How's my week been?
[4974.80 → 4974.98] Yeah.
[4974.98 → 4977.02] Surprisingly tiring, actually.
[4977.24 → 4978.26] This is...
[4978.26 → 4980.22] We've only just recently...
[4980.22 → 4982.50] So you're only just now seeing on the channel.
[4982.92 → 4987.76] A lot of people seem to think that I don't write videos for the Linus Tech Tips channel,
[4988.28 → 4990.90] and that people just write everything for me.
[4993.38 → 4994.34] 90 plus...
[4994.34 → 4997.34] So tech quickie aside, which John's been writing pretty much since he started.
[4997.54 → 5004.84] So Linus Tech Tips-wise, 90 plus percent of what I hosted until, like, two weeks ago,
[5004.98 → 5006.02] was written by me.
[5006.56 → 5011.42] And, like, I remember talking about when we hired Tyler, and he was helping me out with
[5011.42 → 5012.44] a couple scripts here and there.
[5012.74 → 5017.30] When I said that we had a new guy that was helping with the scripts, people...
[5017.30 → 5021.30] Someone posted a comment on a video slightly after that saying, like,
[5021.36 → 5023.30] wow, that was a really great decision to hire the new guy.
[5023.46 → 5025.82] Today's video was, like, way better written than usual.
[5026.28 → 5027.50] Like, I wrote it.
[5027.50 → 5028.50] I'm like...
[5028.50 → 5034.18] Anyway, the last couple of weeks have been crazy because our three new guys started,
[5034.46 → 5041.34] and you're starting to see now on the YouTube channel a huge shift in things being completely
[5041.34 → 5046.40] written by me versus me sitting in more of, like, an editor-in-chief role.
[5046.40 → 5051.94] So most of my time now is taken up by meetings, sitting down, looking at products,
[5052.06 → 5056.96] figuring out the angles that we're going to tackle them from, reviewing notes,
[5057.28 → 5060.88] reviewing finished scripts, reviewing, like, the guidance for the editors,
[5061.20 → 5062.02] reviewing the final video.
[5062.12 → 5070.04] So I'm more like a managing editor than, like, a writer these days.
[5070.04 → 5074.96] What's really cool is it has allowed us to do some really amazing pieces of content
[5074.96 → 5079.80] in a time period that previously wouldn't have been possible.
[5080.62 → 5083.16] Like the Windows 9 analysis.
[5083.80 → 5088.02] Some people didn't like that it had kind of a clickbaity title and thumbnail.
[5089.00 → 5097.48] But if they sort of remove their prejudice, remove their bias from this situation a little bit,
[5097.48 → 5100.32] and look at that video objectively.
[5100.82 → 5101.56] What was it?
[5101.96 → 5106.12] It was about a version of Windows that Microsoft doesn't want you to know about.
[5106.22 → 5107.04] It actually was.
[5107.48 → 5111.18] It was about taking a Microsoft OS that is not commercially available,
[5111.80 → 5115.50] modding the crap out of it to take out all the telemetry and monitoring
[5115.50 → 5118.16] and background processes that you don't care about
[5118.16 → 5121.12] and get a more stable, smoother operating Windows.
[5121.36 → 5122.26] That's what it was about.
[5122.98 → 5125.76] And it was a massive amount of work.
[5126.20 → 5126.68] Huge.
[5126.68 → 5127.86] Massive amount of work.
[5127.98 → 5130.02] It took, like, a week of benchmarking
[5130.02 → 5133.32] to set up all four of the different OS environments
[5133.32 → 5135.26] that we were testing on identical hardware
[5135.26 → 5137.78] to run a huge suite of benchmarks
[5137.78 → 5139.68] to really analyze their performance
[5139.68 → 5142.24] and to do all the work that was involved
[5142.24 → 5144.66] in taking the guidelines from Windows 9
[5144.66 → 5147.64] and creating a more palatable version of Windows 10
[5147.64 → 5149.48] and then creating a blog post
[5149.48 → 5151.48] so that you guys can replicate this on your own.
[5151.80 → 5155.36] Taking Windows 9, which is not actually possible to buy
[5155.36 → 5159.30] unless you have, like, a special education license or something like that,
[5159.58 → 5161.24] and making it applicable to our viewers.
[5161.54 → 5166.66] Great piece of content, objectively, and took a ton of time and was a lot of work.
[5166.88 → 5169.20] That wouldn't have been possible without the writing staff.
[5169.42 → 5171.50] Same thing for stuff like our Ry zen coverage.
[5171.70 → 5173.24] It would not have been as good.
[5173.24 → 5174.70] GTX 1080 Ti.
[5174.70 → 5180.66] It would not have been possible to test so many games on Intel and on Ry zen,
[5180.76 → 5182.84] something that very few other publications did.
[5183.38 → 5185.98] And so a lot of those things are coming through.
[5186.06 → 5186.98] There are some growing pains.
[5187.22 → 5190.96] There's a video coming now that I'm not that happy about the cohesiveness of,
[5191.02 → 5193.88] like the overall flow of the way the B-roll cuts in and stuff like that.
[5193.88 → 5198.22] But basically what's happened in the last two weeks is my job has changed in a big way,
[5198.34 → 5199.32] and I'm adapting to that.
[5199.80 → 5204.26] I have only fully written two videos, aside from the Ry zen launch coverage,
[5204.34 → 5207.68] which obviously I did because I was the only one there, in the last two weeks.
[5208.14 → 5208.88] That's crazy.
[5208.96 → 5210.68] Which previously would have been 8 to 10.
[5211.72 → 5212.46] That's crazy.
[5212.56 → 5212.76] Yeah.
[5213.42 → 5214.16] So it's bananas.
[5214.16 → 5216.30] But you're not working any less, that's for sure.
[5216.36 → 5216.60] No.
[5216.80 → 5218.74] If anything, it's actually been more work.
[5219.20 → 5220.46] It's been kind of crazy.
[5220.46 → 5225.18] Like you hire a bunch of people expecting that to reduce your workload,
[5225.40 → 5229.10] but you actually just end up doing more things and different things.
[5229.68 → 5233.92] With all of that said, I do not plan to entirely leave behind writing.
[5234.08 → 5235.64] I like tinkering with stuff.
[5235.80 → 5237.08] I like being in the trenches.
[5237.44 → 5239.96] And so I will absolutely continue to be involved.
[5240.20 → 5242.60] I'm writing the DJI Magic review that's upcoming.
[5243.94 → 5246.26] I mean, it doesn't help that no one else here can fly a drone.
[5246.26 → 5249.06] I was going to say there's specific stuff like that where only you can do it.
[5249.14 → 5249.30] Yeah.
[5249.30 → 5252.86] But I'm writing the Alienware 13.
[5253.50 → 5257.04] So I'll be taking on, I think, especially stuff that I find particularly interesting.
[5257.18 → 5261.10] And I think that that's another really cool thing about the three people that we have on board,
[5261.16 → 5262.10] is they're all really different.
[5262.22 → 5267.02] So I think you're going to see a different and a new level of passion that goes into the projects
[5267.02 → 5268.04] that people are working on.
[5268.14 → 5270.12] Because nobody has to do everything.
[5270.90 → 5272.14] So that's going to be really cool.
[5272.48 → 5272.66] Yeah.
[5272.66 → 5276.62] I guess all that leaves is our shout-out for Flow Plane Club.
[5276.80 → 5277.82] So Flow Plane Club.
[5277.82 → 5278.10] Woo!
[5278.78 → 5283.88] Flow Plane Club is where you can get a mostly good experience watching.
[5284.26 → 5284.48] Yeah.
[5284.76 → 5285.14] Okay.
[5285.18 → 5285.84] It's in alpha.
[5286.34 → 5286.92] It's alpha.
[5287.18 → 5290.10] Well, it's in a very early stage.
[5290.22 → 5290.64] Early access.
[5290.64 → 5292.44] It doesn't really say alpha, beta, whatever.
[5292.72 → 5294.04] It's in a very early stage.
[5294.06 → 5294.78] Very early stage.
[5294.78 → 5300.26] So right now, the way it works is we're using it as an early access player for LTT,
[5300.54 → 5304.82] Channel Super Fun, and Tech Ricky Videos over on the Linus Tech Tips Forum.
[5304.94 → 5308.30] The plan is to move it off the forum at some point in the future.
[5308.46 → 5310.88] But we're not going to promise a timeline for that.
[5311.40 → 5314.68] And basically, the way you sign up is you go over to the store.
[5317.06 → 5322.26] You go to the Flow Plane Club, which I am not going to screen share because I have no idea
[5322.26 → 5323.24] what's in my other browser.
[5323.24 → 5324.48] I'm going to open up Twitch here.
[5324.94 → 5325.24] Boom.
[5325.28 → 5325.72] There we go.
[5325.80 → 5327.00] I'm going to paste that over there.
[5328.04 → 5328.56] There you go.
[5328.62 → 5330.32] That's where you can join the Flow Plane Club.
[5330.74 → 5331.88] Is Twitch chat even working?
[5332.08 → 5332.20] Yeah.
[5332.28 → 5332.52] There you go.
[5332.56 → 5334.50] The LTT bot was just taking a second to kick in.
[5335.08 → 5341.02] And you'll have a week's worth of videos that you won't find on YouTube.
[5341.28 → 5343.46] So it should be about 10 videos that you haven't seen.
[5343.88 → 5347.60] So this week, there were a lot of releases.
[5348.32 → 5350.72] So that content goes to both platforms immediately.
[5350.72 → 5352.72] You mean simultaneous releases, like time-sensitive releases?
[5352.72 → 5353.86] I mean product releases.
[5354.68 → 5355.44] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[5355.50 → 5355.62] Okay.
[5355.66 → 5356.58] So like 1080 Ti, etc.
[5356.58 → 5358.42] So 1080 Ti is already there.
[5358.88 → 5360.74] And the Intel Extreme Rig Challenge.
[5361.08 → 5365.34] But what actually happens is that whatever was released on Flow Plane before doesn't go
[5365.34 → 5366.34] to YouTube yet on that day.
[5366.40 → 5367.60] It gets pushed forward by another week.
[5367.84 → 5367.96] Yeah.
[5367.96 → 5370.94] So what's already there is the Asus G701.
[5371.94 → 5375.32] We've got a tech quickie on why do electronics get hot.
[5376.40 → 5379.84] We've got, ooh, Viewer's Choice Episode 2 is over there.
[5379.94 → 5382.60] So where we take the most popular items you guys are buying on Amazon.
[5382.78 → 5383.46] Will they be the same?
[5383.52 → 5384.04] Will they be different?
[5384.30 → 5385.10] Some of them are the same.
[5385.18 → 5385.78] Some of them are different.
[5386.12 → 5389.78] We've got the Dell XPS 27, audiophile grade AIO computer.
[5390.62 → 5391.96] What else have we got over there?
[5394.44 → 5396.50] Every AMD video card tested.
[5396.82 → 5397.06] Yeah.
[5397.76 → 5399.26] That's actually a pretty cool video.
[5401.60 → 5402.40] LTE VG solves the...
[5402.40 → 5403.44] That one's on YouTube already.
[5403.62 → 5403.80] Yeah.
[5404.10 → 5404.30] Yeah.
[5404.38 → 5405.06] So there's...
[5405.06 → 5405.34] Oh, yeah.
[5405.44 → 5408.20] Server Room Update Vlog, Episode 3 out of 3, the finale.
[5408.52 → 5409.22] That's on there.
[5409.34 → 5410.78] That's a great thumbnail.
[5411.18 → 5411.62] Great thumbnail.
[5411.98 → 5412.16] Yeah.
[5412.48 → 5416.54] That one would have been on YouTube by now, but it's been pushed by some of these simultaneous releases.
[5416.64 → 5416.86] Anyway.
[5417.18 → 5420.76] And it's coming to YouTube very soon.
[5420.86 → 5421.72] Is it coming very soon?
[5422.50 → 5423.26] Very soon.
[5423.26 → 5424.18] Should we do a sneak peek?
[5424.74 → 5425.28] What do you mean?
[5425.94 → 5426.48] Should we...
[5426.48 → 5429.14] Should we do a live demo of Float plane Club working?
[5429.44 → 5430.24] Oh, gosh.
[5430.44 → 5431.08] So, oh, yeah.
[5431.26 → 5435.22] So the bit rate is higher for playback for our 1080p.
[5435.22 → 5437.06] So 1080p looks better on Float plane.
[5437.20 → 5438.24] Also, you can download.
[5438.54 → 5440.70] I have to be in Luke's shoes this time and hope that it works.
[5440.70 → 5443.06] We're going full on.
[5443.12 → 5444.24] We're going 1080p, man.
[5445.14 → 5445.80] Let's give it a sec.
[5446.68 → 5447.46] Oh, oh.
[5448.06 → 5449.38] Like I said, it mostly works.
[5452.50 → 5452.86] Okay.
[5454.00 → 5454.48] What's up?
[5455.20 → 5455.60] What do you want?
[5456.20 → 5456.44] Oh.
[5456.72 → 5457.08] Wow.
[5457.12 → 5457.60] That was quick.
[5458.66 → 5459.06] Oh.
[5459.86 → 5460.86] Ruhr.
[5461.40 → 5463.20] Way to go, Linus, doing a live demo.
[5463.92 → 5464.32] Walkway.
[5464.54 → 5464.98] Book.
[5466.08 → 5466.54] Oh, whatever.
[5466.64 → 5467.20] It usually works.
[5467.20 → 5467.42] Come on, Linus.
[5467.64 → 5469.78] It works, like, most of the time.
[5469.82 → 5470.22] Yeah, that's why we have the...
[5470.22 → 5472.76] That's why we're saying it's very early stages.
[5472.94 → 5474.14] It works most of the time.
[5475.76 → 5476.12] Okay.
[5476.42 → 5477.58] So I think that's pretty much it.
[5477.66 → 5478.84] Thanks for tuning into the WAN Show.
[5478.90 → 5480.36] We will see you guys again next week.
[5480.88 → 5483.88] Same bat time, same bat channel.
[5484.52 → 5484.98] Bye-bye.
[5490.26 → 5491.56] Same bat time, same bat channel.
[5491.56 → 5493.68] It's from Batman from the 70s.
[5493.68 → 5495.44] Yeah.
[5498.14 → 5499.94] But, like, for me, it's kind of a joke.
[5500.16 → 5502.76] Because it's kind of like same bat time, same bat channel.
[5502.84 → 5505.02] It's a bad channel.
[5506.56 → 5507.60] But, yeah, that's sort of...
[5507.60 → 5508.66] That's what it's worth.
[5510.12 → 5512.82] Surprisingly, few people actually get the Batman.
[5512.82 → 5513.72] It's like, yeah.
[5513.78 → 5513.98] Yeah.
[5517.56 → 5519.02] And make a fucking.
[5519.48 → 5520.20] They'reunion.
[5520.20 → 5520.60] I it.
[5520.60 → 5521.26] See!
[5521.26 → 5521.32] See!
