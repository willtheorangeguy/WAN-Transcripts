[0.00 → 12.22] Okay, we're live actually now. I was like, we're going live now, and then Nick was like got prepared to actually be live, and then I was like, uh, uh, uh, not, not quite yet.
[12.22 → 21.60] Anyway, welcome to the show. I will be hosting as sick today, and Nick will be hosting as tired today, so we're sick and tired.
[21.60 → 30.92] Yes! Accomplished. Joke goal made. Anyway, we have some great topics. If I can scroll back up, that would be awesome.
[31.06 → 40.68] Ry zen 5 news, specs, all that fun stuff is coming. That'll be good. Very good. Pricing, good. Minimum specs, good. Other people here, sick.
[41.16 → 47.78] Anyway, Microsoft actively blocking Windows 7, 8, 8.1 updates on Kaby Lake and Ry zen systems.
[47.78 → 72.74] Can you stop? Also, Vulcan's multi-GPU muscle now requires Windows 10 as well. Just in case you didn't like Windows 10, they're going to try to make you like Windows 10, and hopefully people like me will be actively, very intensely looking into how they can switch their whole platform into a basis on Linux.
[72.74 → 76.60] Because I'm trying to bail. That will maybe be a bigger topic.
[76.60 → 77.32] You're trying to bail Windows?
[77.60 → 80.80] I'm trying to bail on Windows. I'm trying real hard to bail on Windows.
[81.12 → 89.38] I'm trying to figure out how I can do, like, over, like, over motherboard instead of over network streaming of, like, games and stuff.
[89.38 → 94.90] So I can play most of my games natively on Linux, but streamed from a Windows VM.
[95.70 → 100.32] And, like, games that aren't on Steam, because Steam is the only one that's going to handle any of this well.
[100.60 → 108.64] I'll have to just, like, run through a VM, but I'm sort of maybe want to use Unpaid, but Unpaid might not even be the best solution for, but, yeah.
[108.96 → 113.46] But I want the only thing I ever do on Windows to be launching and playing games.
[114.00 → 115.48] That's it. Nothing else.
[115.66 → 117.34] So essentially macOS for life.
[117.34 → 120.80] Roll the intro.
[120.80 → 121.68] Oh, ho, ho, ho.
[126.06 → 128.80] Do we have...
[128.80 → 130.56] What? What?
[143.86 → 144.88] Crash book!
[144.88 → 147.34] We don't have music.
[147.34 → 148.32] We have my voice.
[148.40 → 149.34] And we also have Squarespace!
[151.04 → 152.20] Dot com slash WAN.
[153.28 → 153.84] No guest.
[154.10 → 154.54] We're back.
[154.66 → 156.34] Dot com slash WAN is correct.
[156.80 → 157.38] So that's good.
[158.24 → 160.34] Let's start with...
[160.34 → 162.20] Ry zen 5.
[162.20 → 167.66] So there was actually a leak slightly before...
[167.66 → 169.92] Yeah.
[169.92 → 171.16] Quote-unquote leak.
[171.66 → 176.88] Slightly before this whole thing was, like, officially announced.
[177.04 → 177.78] There was a leak.
[177.90 → 178.74] I will show you guys.
[178.80 → 181.52] I have to click on Linus's screen, which is weird, because it's not his screen.
[181.52 → 183.18] PC Master Race Subreddit.
[183.46 → 184.48] There was a...
[184.48 → 186.56] I believe this is Guru3D article.
[187.26 → 188.18] Let me scroll in there.
[188.28 → 188.48] Yeah.
[189.48 → 191.08] Talking about Ry zen 5.
[191.24 → 196.18] But this isn't super important anymore, because whatever, dude.
[196.28 → 197.36] Let me go back to no guest.
[197.48 → 198.86] We have actual announcements.
[199.86 → 200.40] Do-do-do.
[201.06 → 206.48] So if we go to AMD.com and go to their press release page, that's even more fun.
[208.28 → 209.24] There we go.
[209.34 → 210.88] You can see the whole chart for it.
[211.00 → 212.10] Ry zen 5.
[212.46 → 217.82] You've got the 1600X, the 1600, the 1500X, and the 1400.
[220.12 → 221.92] The lineup here is actually pretty sick.
[222.04 → 223.66] Six cores, 12 threads.
[224.24 → 228.86] I believe it's, like, about half the price as the previous one.
[229.34 → 230.82] Maybe give or take a little bit.
[230.86 → 233.22] I don't remember exactly how much the previous one is at 200.
[233.52 → 234.50] This one's at $250.
[235.08 → 240.84] Six cores, 12 threads, 3.6 gigahertz base clock, 4 gigahertz boost clock for $250.
[241.66 → 243.14] It's actually pretty wicked.
[243.44 → 243.96] It's kind of nuts.
[244.12 → 246.96] I've been interested in the Ry zen 5 lineup the whole time,
[246.96 → 249.82] because looking at the stuff that we already have,
[250.48 → 254.86] the 1080p performance was not as great as other things.
[255.00 → 257.52] And I think with the processors that we already have,
[257.52 → 258.94] it doesn't really matter that much.
[259.10 → 259.22] Yeah.
[259.36 → 261.32] Because if you're buying that tier of hardware,
[261.74 → 263.54] you're probably not gaming at 1080p.
[263.98 → 265.28] You're probably shooting for higher.
[265.40 → 267.12] Or gaming isn't the only thing that you're doing.
[267.24 → 267.88] That, too.
[268.10 → 268.30] Yeah.
[268.42 → 270.34] So either you're not that worried about it,
[270.38 → 273.92] and you're running workloads that are more related to things like Cine bench,
[274.08 → 276.28] where it's going to be using all them cores,
[276.38 → 277.72] and you're just going to rock out anyway.
[278.18 → 280.68] Or you're shooting above 1080p,
[280.80 → 284.02] so the performance numbers at higher resolution was really what you're looking at,
[284.02 → 285.04] and then you're in great shape.
[285.38 → 287.86] With the Ry zen 5 stuff, it's going to be more interesting.
[288.20 → 289.78] Again, it's me,
[289.94 → 294.40] so I'm not going to really care too much until we get on our bench here and try it ourselves.
[294.64 → 297.68] But now the 1080p performance is going to really come out strong.
[297.68 → 307.12] But the fact that you can get a 4-core 8-thread processor at 3.2GHz base and 3.4GHz boost for $169
[307.12 → 309.50] is pretty wicked.
[310.02 → 312.60] Or you can bump that up by a little bit,
[312.66 → 316.28] get 3.7GHz on the boost clock for $189.
[316.58 → 317.70] That's only $20 more.
[318.26 → 319.60] It's a pretty tight product stack.
[319.86 → 320.98] This is actually fascinating,
[320.98 → 324.58] because when Ry zen 7 was announced,
[324.94 → 326.10] I saw the pricing,
[326.26 → 326.72] and I was like,
[327.38 → 331.54] wow, if their top-end lineup has a chip at $329,
[331.90 → 334.60] are they going to price themselves out of the lower-end?
[334.92 → 336.56] How are they going to do that?
[336.72 → 339.64] I think their whole stack is just really tight.
[340.00 → 340.34] Yeah.
[341.04 → 342.40] Really, really minor increments.
[342.44 → 343.88] You pay like $20, $30 more,
[343.94 → 344.90] and you get a better processor.
[345.14 → 348.72] So then I guess that's kind of awesome, actually,
[348.72 → 351.40] because then price-to-performance actually becomes a conversation again.
[351.50 → 351.88] Yes.
[352.00 → 352.94] Instead of like,
[353.42 → 355.74] okay, here's where it slots into the price stack,
[355.84 → 358.04] so here's exactly where it's slotting into the performance stack,
[358.08 → 360.08] and we can pretty much estimate where everything's going to be
[360.08 → 361.14] before we even have it.
[361.96 → 363.12] Which is so boring.
[363.34 → 364.06] Just to like,
[364.40 → 366.52] especially from the reviewer side of things,
[366.58 → 367.78] that is incredibly boring.
[368.02 → 369.50] When you know you have a shipment coming in,
[369.88 → 371.24] and you know exactly what it is,
[371.24 → 371.84] and you're like,
[371.94 → 374.26] okay, well, I know the conclusion of this video already.
[374.48 → 376.04] It's going to be at this FPS in this game,
[376.12 → 377.46] because it's priced at that,
[377.46 → 379.00] it's pretty lame.
[379.10 → 379.88] It's pretty boring.
[379.96 → 382.66] But it's going to be nice to actually have the conversation of like,
[383.28 → 386.92] hey, if you have $169 to get a $1400,
[387.66 → 390.44] if you get $169,
[390.86 → 394.30] is it worth saving that extra $20 and getting a $1500X?
[395.32 → 396.72] That's a conversation now.
[396.78 → 397.44] That is a really,
[397.44 → 402.26] and like one thing that I'm excited for is not just like build guides,
[402.48 → 406.54] but like recommended builds are going to be way more interesting now.
[406.54 → 407.78] Because instead of like,
[407.88 → 408.60] oh, well,
[408.66 → 409.88] you have that budget,
[410.04 → 411.32] I guess just buy this stuff,
[411.44 → 411.66] because,
[411.78 → 412.08] you know,
[412.22 → 414.34] cookie cutter builds are what everything is right now.
[414.54 → 418.60] We'll have a way wider range of things that you can do with your build.
[418.82 → 420.54] You can specify more specifics.
[421.08 → 421.22] Like,
[421.48 → 421.72] wow.
[421.98 → 422.80] Great sentence.
[423.18 → 425.44] Specify your specifics for specificity.
[425.58 → 425.90] But like,
[425.94 → 427.74] if you're sticking only at 1080p,
[428.08 → 431.86] for like only certain games that aren't taking advantage of multicore,
[431.86 → 433.06] then you go with one thing.
[433.06 → 433.38] If you're,
[433.42 → 435.16] if you're going to stay at 1080p,
[435.24 → 436.36] but you're not gaming,
[436.64 → 438.06] you're doing workstation stuff,
[438.16 → 439.88] then you want something else entirely.
[439.88 → 440.50] And it's just,
[440.64 → 441.10] I don't know.
[441.22 → 442.16] It's actually really cool.
[442.40 → 443.46] Very exciting time.
[443.80 → 447.80] And build suggestions will include things like monitors,
[448.26 → 449.82] which is cool.
[450.48 → 451.22] I don't know.
[451.34 → 452.00] I like that.
[452.26 → 452.86] I like how,
[452.94 → 453.34] uh,
[453.96 → 454.80] on the press release,
[454.90 → 456.56] there's cautionary statement.
[456.56 → 458.82] And it's like super long.
[459.00 → 459.22] Okay.
[459.30 → 459.58] Let me,
[459.66 → 460.36] let me scroll down.
[460.44 → 461.06] Where is this?
[461.58 → 461.98] Wow.
[463.10 → 464.12] What the heck?
[464.32 → 466.32] Is it the longest section that they have?
[466.42 → 466.58] Yeah.
[466.70 → 469.50] This press release contains forward-looking statements concerning advanced micro devices,
[469.64 → 469.78] Inc.
[470.84 → 471.88] Formational purposes only.
[472.00 → 472.40] And may the features,
[472.50 → 472.80] functionality,
[472.94 → 473.18] available,
[473.28 → 473.44] timing,
[473.92 → 474.60] extra benefits,
[474.74 → 474.86] blah,
[474.86 → 475.12] blah,
[475.12 → 475.18] blah,
[475.18 → 475.42] blah.
[475.50 → 478.80] It's like literally half the freaking page.
[478.92 → 479.28] Yup.
[480.30 → 480.70] Almost.
[481.12 → 481.32] Not,
[481.44 → 481.92] not quite,
[482.06 → 483.60] but that's the society we live in,
[483.60 → 483.96] man.
[484.56 → 486.20] Please don't sue us for things.
[486.20 → 488.00] We'd really like it if you didn't.
[488.14 → 490.42] We're just trying to say cool stuff about the process.
[490.42 → 493.16] We're just trying to give you guys cool processors,
[493.46 → 493.92] please.
[495.44 → 496.20] Did you hear,
[496.28 → 496.40] okay,
[496.44 → 497.86] this is slightly a bit of an aside,
[498.04 → 498.20] but,
[498.28 → 498.90] uh,
[498.92 → 502.80] I don't think you guys necessarily saw this because this one wasn't streamed,
[502.80 → 506.48] but I did a question and answers thing with Intel at PAX East.
[506.60 → 509.20] And a guy came on stage with a Ry zen hat.
[509.26 → 509.66] Nice.
[509.80 → 510.34] That was,
[510.48 → 511.60] that was epic.
[511.74 → 512.62] That was fun.
[512.72 → 513.08] I always,
[513.16 → 513.96] I was very happy.
[513.96 → 515.46] Everyone at Intel was cool with it,
[515.46 → 516.46] which I thought was cool.
[516.74 → 517.02] Uh,
[517.02 → 518.82] an Intel person like helped him,
[518.94 → 520.32] escorted him on stage and everything.
[520.46 → 521.58] Like they were all cool with it.
[521.98 → 522.42] Uh,
[522.42 → 523.66] we roasted him a little bit.
[523.72 → 524.32] It was fun.
[524.42 → 526.60] He got the one like Intel specific question,
[526.76 → 527.40] uh,
[527.42 → 527.84] wrong,
[528.04 → 529.80] which he defended with like,
[529.88 → 530.02] well,
[530.02 → 530.64] it makes sense.
[530.68 → 531.10] And I was like,
[531.10 → 531.36] okay,
[531.42 → 531.66] yeah,
[531.66 → 532.22] that's fine.
[532.84 → 533.24] Um,
[533.38 → 535.32] although you should know about your,
[535.60 → 537.20] the people that you don't like to,
[537.28 → 538.86] to justify the things that you do like,
[538.90 → 539.38] but whatever,
[539.54 → 540.24] don't worry about it.
[540.26 → 540.68] It's cool.
[540.68 → 542.54] Blind fanboyism is the way the world works.
[542.54 → 544.60] Obviously I'll see.
[544.70 → 544.72] You know,
[544.74 → 547.58] what's fun is because that conversation happened right after Ry zen.
[547.66 → 549.22] Now there's going to be all the comments of like,
[549.22 → 549.82] uh,
[550.00 → 553.08] Intel just pays them to talk about Intel whenever there's a Ry zen topic.
[555.74 → 556.18] Oh,
[556.34 → 557.06] I'm triggered.
[557.78 → 558.22] Yeah.
[558.62 → 559.84] I'm super happy.
[560.04 → 560.24] I,
[560.42 → 560.56] well,
[560.64 → 560.82] okay.
[560.82 → 564.78] I guess I just say super excited for Ry zen five to come out specifically just
[564.78 → 566.28] because of what we were just talking about.
[566.32 → 567.58] That's that's yes.
[568.30 → 570.92] That is the line that's going to start a new conversation.
[571.10 → 571.44] Well,
[571.44 → 572.38] not a new conversation,
[572.38 → 574.20] but a conversation that we haven't been able to have for what,
[574.24 → 575.60] like four years,
[575.80 → 577.38] five years at a minimum.
[578.70 → 579.82] So like,
[579.82 → 583.08] I don't know if you remember this too much,
[583.08 → 586.86] but the like 83 50 versus what was it?
[588.92 → 591.60] Like I'm assuming 3,500 K,
[591.74 → 593.76] but Intel changes their product names all the time.
[594.04 → 594.40] 75 70.
[594.56 → 597.20] The like high end I five from that time.
[598.02 → 598.80] I think so.
[598.86 → 599.00] Yeah.
[599.10 → 599.22] Yeah.
[599.36 → 599.70] I can't,
[599.70 → 601.86] I don't remember the exact pairing that the war was,
[602.16 → 605.28] but there was this giant freaking war back when we were in the garage.
[606.02 → 607.52] I think that was Sandy bridge.
[607.94 → 608.30] No,
[608.36 → 609.28] it was just after that.
[609.42 → 609.80] I think it was three.
[609.88 → 610.16] Anyway,
[610.40 → 610.76] anyway,
[610.88 → 612.72] that was super intense.
[613.32 → 614.02] And like,
[614.78 → 616.62] it was fun being a reviewer.
[616.62 → 618.58] Cause all the other reviewers are releasing like,
[619.02 → 619.58] Oh man,
[619.68 → 623.22] we tried this like different benchmark, and it came out this way.
[623.28 → 625.24] And this processor is way freaking better.
[625.24 → 626.18] And we're like,
[626.24 → 626.86] Oh my goodness.
[626.86 → 627.76] We need to try this.
[627.76 → 632.16] but like with our own types of benchmarks, and we get different numbers or like they,
[632.22 → 638.44] they are represented differently in this one specific setup or like maybe these guys are running a different version of windows.
[638.44 → 642.44] And this version of windows plays more nicely with this specific processor,
[642.44 → 643.62] or a chipset or whatever.
[643.62 → 643.98] Like,
[644.44 → 644.82] man,
[644.94 → 645.82] that was fun.
[646.32 → 646.52] It's,
[646.56 → 647.10] it's been,
[647.40 → 650.22] it's been a little boring not to like,
[650.80 → 652.40] yeah,
[652.56 → 654.12] it just sort of has everything.
[654.12 → 654.38] Just,
[654.46 → 656.92] it's been less exciting than it could have been.
[656.98 → 657.48] There we go.
[657.58 → 657.80] Yeah.
[657.86 → 659.58] There's the proper PR answer,
[659.66 → 660.88] but we're getting there.
[660.96 → 661.22] Yeah.
[661.34 → 663.96] So rise of five will hopefully put us back into like that.
[664.04 → 664.96] Oh my God.
[664.98 → 665.38] Yeah.
[665.82 → 665.98] Yeah.
[665.98 → 666.96] And I'm,
[667.02 → 668.36] I'm really excited for something.
[668.50 → 669.82] We also haven't experienced for a while.
[669.96 → 671.00] You go on like PCR,
[671.08 → 672.94] or PCMR Subreddit and stuff,
[672.94 → 674.18] and you see everyone like,
[674.26 → 674.56] Oh,
[674.80 → 677.60] 1080 GI came out to pictures of pulling the thing off.
[677.68 → 677.80] Yeah.
[677.82 → 679.06] I bought a really expensive piece of hardware.
[679.30 → 683.24] One thing that'll be nice about rise in five is like,
[683.42 → 683.66] look,
[683.66 → 690.74] I made this very price performance optimized rig for exactly what I want to do.
[690.80 → 693.30] This totally makes sense for what I want to do.
[693.32 → 695.16] And I'm really proud of this system in general.
[695.82 → 696.76] That's super cool.
[696.76 → 698.76] That's like what I've always really liked about computers.
[698.90 → 702.30] It's always fun to have the like halo product Lamborghini effect.
[702.60 → 706.04] Everyone wants to look at the super sick processor or the super sick graphics card.
[706.12 → 707.80] That has always been a thing.
[707.96 → 710.84] The first time I started working here in Linus handed me to like,
[710.92 → 713.28] I think it was five eighties.
[713.66 → 714.68] I was like,
[715.02 → 716.86] Holy crap.
[716.98 → 718.10] There's always that moment,
[718.22 → 724.70] but still it's cool to see what people can like be proud of and come up with in terms of different build decisions and stuff like that.
[724.76 → 725.38] And for a while,
[725.40 → 726.38] it's been a little cookie cutter.
[726.70 → 727.16] Anyway,
[727.54 → 730.72] moving on to a topic that depresses me quite a bit.
[731.36 → 734.04] Microsoft is actively blocking windows seven,
[734.24 → 743.64] eight and 8.1 updates on Kaby Lake and Ry zen systems in an effort to get you to upgrade to Windows 10 updates on legacy versions.
[743.66 → 744.74] Windows 7,
[744.74 → 751.98] eight and 8.1 are not supported on new chips like Intel seventh generation or newer AMD Bristol Ridge or newer,
[751.98 → 757.72] including Ry zen and Qualcomm 89 96 or newer.
[758.44 → 760.88] This is a post from ours technical.
[760.88 → 763.92] And this just,
[764.12 → 764.32] yeah,
[764.54 → 771.88] it legitimately makes me really sad because this is a very lame way to push people forward.
[773.24 → 774.74] And absolutely unneeded.
[774.74 → 778.74] Yeah.
[779.06 → 779.74] It's like,
[779.80 → 780.02] there's,
[780.10 → 781.46] there are some fair statements in here.
[781.52 → 784.94] Using windows seven on these latest systems is already awkward in many situations.
[784.94 → 791.98] The operating system has no built-in support for USB three or NVMe while neither hurdle is insurmountable at all.
[791.98 → 796.06] That's a really important statement within this article.
[796.26 → 798.58] They're like very easy to overcome issues,
[799.12 → 800.44] like not that big of a deal.
[800.54 → 806.42] Installing windows seven at the very beginning can sometimes be a little bit rough because those USB three drivers and stuff like that.
[806.54 → 806.64] Yeah.
[806.64 → 809.34] But almost every board has at least two USB ports.
[809.72 → 811.78] You can get going with your keyboard and mouse.
[811.90 → 814.82] You can get those USB three drivers installed and everything's fine.
[817.50 → 817.94] Counterpoint.
[818.20 → 818.46] Yeah.
[819.00 → 820.86] Maybe this is,
[821.02 → 821.78] you know,
[822.08 → 828.22] the sign that soon we'll only have USB three drivers or ports.
[828.38 → 828.74] Ports.
[828.92 → 829.14] Yeah.
[829.78 → 830.04] Yeah.
[830.10 → 830.44] You know?
[830.60 → 830.82] Yeah.
[831.14 → 832.98] So maybe there's a positive to it.
[833.02 → 833.12] Look,
[833.18 → 835.56] you don't have to be such a pessimist all the time.
[835.56 → 838.44] Embrace your Microsoft overlords.
[838.64 → 838.90] My,
[839.08 → 841.32] my motherboard has a PS2 port.
[841.34 → 841.54] Embrace them.
[842.76 → 844.28] Because I'm that kind of guy.
[844.80 → 844.96] Yeah,
[844.96 → 848.68] but that's because you're just like a weird hipster douche sometimes.
[851.52 → 852.48] I'll take that.
[852.60 → 852.74] Yeah.
[852.74 → 852.98] That's fair.
[856.10 → 858.48] We just released the analog video.
[860.00 → 862.24] There's no way I'd be able to get away with that.
[862.24 → 865.76] Oh man.
[865.76 → 866.04] Yeah.
[866.04 → 868.12] It's a thing sometimes.
[868.36 → 871.06] That's another thing noted in the article though,
[871.06 → 875.74] is that installing Windows 8.1 is a relatively smooth sailing experience.
[875.74 → 876.86] Um,
[877.14 → 879.82] and with Kaby Lake's overwhelming similarity to Sky Lake,
[879.92 → 881.80] dropping support does feel rather unnecessary.
[882.10 → 883.08] I have very releasing,
[883.46 → 884.04] releasing.
[884.16 → 887.54] I have very recently installed Windows 8.1 on a few different systems.
[887.64 → 887.84] Yeah.
[888.96 → 889.76] Zero issues.
[889.90 → 890.14] Right.
[890.42 → 892.62] No matter what tier of processor I was using.
[892.74 → 894.12] And I used a fairly wide range.
[894.24 → 894.88] Do you think,
[895.22 → 895.70] um,
[896.02 → 896.96] not too crazy.
[896.96 → 898.00] It didn't go way too far back,
[898.12 → 898.82] but like still,
[898.82 → 903.16] do you think there'll be something like a windows nine that gets around this
[903.16 → 903.42] somehow?
[903.62 → 904.22] Or is this like,
[904.22 → 904.46] no,
[904.52 → 910.38] cause windows nine is windows nine is very technically just Windows 8.1.
[910.62 → 910.92] Okay.
[910.92 → 911.70] So there's like,
[911.70 → 912.54] skin mods on it.
[912.90 → 914.48] That makes it look like windows seven.
[914.66 → 918.44] So the name should actually be like Windows 8.5 or something.
[918.86 → 920.76] If you want to call it or like windows,
[921.46 → 923.34] Windows 9.5 or something.
[923.66 → 924.02] Yes.
[925.40 → 925.84] Sure.
[926.22 → 926.78] I like it.
[926.78 → 927.34] So anyway,
[927.34 → 931.54] this is too much of like a baseline change to have someone be able to come
[931.54 → 932.84] in and hack it out or whatever.
[933.16 → 933.48] Yeah.
[933.62 → 933.76] Like,
[933.76 → 933.96] yeah,
[933.96 → 935.46] I don't think that's really going to happen.
[935.56 → 935.96] All right.
[936.04 → 936.40] Uh,
[936.40 → 936.92] not with,
[937.20 → 937.80] not with windows.
[937.86 → 939.12] But if you did something like Linux,
[939.20 → 940.82] you could make your own fork and make it work.
[940.94 → 941.20] Yeah.
[941.24 → 943.32] But then you have to actually do things.
[943.84 → 944.20] Yeah.
[944.34 → 945.62] I don't like doing things.
[945.74 → 946.00] That's,
[946.06 → 946.28] that's,
[946.40 → 947.00] that's fair.
[947.82 → 948.42] That's fair.
[948.68 → 948.90] Yeah.
[949.32 → 950.36] I will hopefully,
[950.68 → 953.66] if I can get everything working to the degree that I want it to,
[953.66 → 956.00] which like to give some background for this,
[956.00 → 960.42] I am very much not a fan of Windows 10.
[960.84 → 961.34] Um,
[961.34 → 967.44] I stream a fair amount, and I've been having a lot of issues using Windows 10
[967.44 → 969.52] compared to using previous versions of windows.
[969.52 → 971.46] So I,
[971.64 → 977.52] and then like all the telemetry data stuff and like all the things that have been happening around that lately.
[977.68 → 980.58] I just don't want to deal with it anymore.
[980.80 → 985.76] I don't need everything in my entire life to be cloud connected all the time.
[985.76 → 988.74] And I would rather just connect to services when I need to connect to them.
[988.82 → 998.24] It's really not that big of a deal for me to not have Cortana constantly running and not really be able to be properly disabled and having it re-enable itself and all that kind of stuff.
[998.46 → 998.64] Yep.
[998.76 → 999.32] Super annoying.
[999.32 → 1001.48] So I personally want to try moving to Linux,
[1001.68 → 1008.10] but I still need my windows for certain things that just aren't going to run on Linux very well.
[1008.62 → 1009.04] Um,
[1009.06 → 1012.92] so I have a lot of work ahead of me.
[1013.00 → 1014.88] I want to use Synergy.
[1015.20 → 1015.62] Okay.
[1015.74 → 1020.40] To make it so that my mouse can go across systems super,
[1020.56 → 1021.16] super easily.
[1021.84 → 1025.64] And one keyboard and mouse that I can never really tell that I'm using two different systems.
[1025.64 → 1028.98] And one monitor will just be windows and one monitor will be Linux.
[1029.28 → 1033.08] And I want to be able to like to transfer everything back and forth and have everything work beautifully.
[1033.78 → 1034.16] Um,
[1034.16 → 1034.52] but yeah,
[1034.52 → 1034.88] that's,
[1034.94 → 1036.22] that's a long ways coming.
[1036.32 → 1038.20] Don't expect this video anytime soon.
[1038.20 → 1039.68] Might not even end up making the video.
[1039.82 → 1041.00] It's just going to be my personal setup.
[1041.00 → 1041.94] I would like to,
[1042.48 → 1044.80] but that would probably involve hauling my rig to work.
[1045.00 → 1051.76] So maybe not fun because amethyst falling off and stuff would be bad.
[1051.92 → 1053.04] That would not be good.
[1053.62 → 1054.88] It's happened twice.
[1054.88 → 1056.10] Amethyst have fallen.
[1056.22 → 1057.82] There's one update for my personal rig.
[1057.92 → 1059.72] Amethyst have fallen twice.
[1060.06 → 1061.70] Both times are when I moved the system.
[1061.90 → 1063.80] The first time was moving my system to my house.
[1064.12 → 1067.84] The second time was moving my system from the desk that it was at to a new desk.
[1068.60 → 1069.34] So like,
[1070.34 → 1074.84] those are all just going to fall off within like the next few months.
[1074.84 → 1075.54] I don't think,
[1075.64 → 1077.36] I don't think all of them,
[1077.66 → 1083.54] the only ones that fell off didn't have very good connections because I had to mount them to a thin rail.
[1083.54 → 1085.16] Like if this is the amethyst rock,
[1085.26 → 1086.64] I had to mount them to a thin rail here.
[1086.82 → 1087.04] Yeah.
[1087.16 → 1091.96] All the ones that had a flat wall are sticking quite well to the point where I can like to grab it and kind of pull on it a little bit.
[1092.10 → 1092.92] And it's staying there.
[1093.56 → 1097.30] But like the ones that are above where like the heat sink are and stuff,
[1097.40 → 1103.42] those are sketchy because I mounted those on the fan bracket for if you want to install a radiator in the top.
[1103.42 → 1103.86] Okay.
[1104.46 → 1107.76] So if I can maybe find some other way to mount them up there,
[1107.86 → 1108.38] they'll be fine.
[1108.50 → 1109.20] But yeah,
[1109.28 → 1110.60] everything else has been fine.
[1110.68 → 1114.36] It's just the ones that are above like the CPU heat sink that have been an issue.
[1116.00 → 1117.20] Moving on.
[1117.40 → 1122.46] So this is Chrome 57 wanting to throttle background tabs to save energy.
[1122.88 → 1124.86] Do you want to do the Vulcan thing or no?
[1124.92 → 1125.68] The Vulcan thing.
[1125.82 → 1126.46] Did I miss something?
[1126.56 → 1127.08] I did.
[1127.24 → 1128.66] Vulcan's multi GPU muscle.
[1128.66 → 1131.84] So this kind of ties into the Windows 10 topic.
[1132.08 → 1132.38] Yes.
[1132.54 → 1134.80] Also requires Windows 10.
[1134.96 → 1138.64] So Vulcan will only support multiple GPUs in Windows 10,
[1138.74 → 1141.80] dropping Windows 7, 8, 8.1 operating systems.
[1142.46 → 1153.04] Native multi GPU support for NVIDIA, GeForce SLI, and AMD Radeon Crossfire setups will now require WDDM to be set to linked display adapter mode,
[1153.46 → 1155.42] something that is exclusive to Windows 10.
[1155.42 → 1159.76] So I talked about this a little bit.
[1160.46 → 1163.82] I didn't talk about the requirement for Windows 10.
[1164.16 → 1164.34] Right.
[1164.46 → 1172.24] But I talked about like the different modes like LDA, M, or linked display adapter mode, LDA, all this other kind of stuff.
[1172.68 → 1175.48] And the WTF is going on with SLI video.
[1175.72 → 1180.00] If you want to check that out, I can't point in the corner because this isn't going to be edited.
[1180.46 → 1181.38] It's live show.
[1181.38 → 1186.68] I just got the like physical reaction that I was like referencing a video and I needed to go like this.
[1186.68 → 1192.90] Because like just shoving your fingers up to my left is like just what happens whenever I reference a video.
[1192.90 → 1205.12] But yeah, if you want to learn more about like link display adapter modes and like all that other weird stuff that is happening with weird and actually very cool stuff that's currently happening with multiple graphics cards,
[1205.24 → 1207.22] check out the WTF is going on with SLI video.
[1207.22 → 1218.30] And if that intrigues you, and you're like, I want to deep dive into more things, check out WTF is going on with DX12 and Vulcan, which is actually still a very valid video, which I'm happy about.
[1218.54 → 1220.50] Even with current information, it's very valid.
[1220.58 → 1223.64] There are some things that have been like refined slightly, but not even that much.
[1223.94 → 1226.28] We're pretty much in the exact same spot we were at before.
[1226.62 → 1229.86] Game developers are not building things from the ground up with Vulcan DX12.
[1229.86 → 1236.74] They're starting with DX11 and then like converting things over, and it's not being properly optimized and none of it really matters yet.
[1237.00 → 1241.10] But Luke, you didn't test on Vulcan in DX12, so obviously your methodology is flawed.
[1241.34 → 1243.18] I am so happy that that's done.
[1243.84 → 1246.30] I am so happy that people have stopped that.
[1246.62 → 1248.02] That was freaking nuts.
[1249.26 → 1250.34] Oh my God.
[1251.48 → 1252.32] Fun times.
[1252.72 → 1256.00] Oh my God, you guys are shills because you didn't use this thing that is broken.
[1256.00 → 1256.36] Oh my God.
[1259.30 → 1260.10] People are fun.
[1260.34 → 1262.76] Okay, now actually moving on to Chrome 57.
[1262.94 → 1266.26] Chrome 57 will throttle background tabs to save energy.
[1266.68 → 1272.70] After 10 seconds of being in the background, not in focus, I guess, because you could have a bunch of monitors,
[1273.28 → 1277.72] it will drop its performance by a little bit.
[1277.72 → 1287.20] So I wonder how that's going to affect the performance of stuff like YouTube, music, or like Twitch streams,
[1287.52 → 1295.38] where a lot of people, you know, any of those, where a lot of people will be doing their work on their main monitor or whatever
[1295.38 → 1300.46] and they'll have like music in a different tab or a video playing in a different tab.
[1300.46 → 1305.58] So 1% of CPU is still a fair amount.
[1305.90 → 1306.00] Yeah.
[1306.10 → 1314.38] I would be interested to see how this works for like lower end laptops and stuff like that.
[1316.28 → 1318.06] But I don't know.
[1318.40 → 1319.42] It's going to be interesting.
[1319.60 → 1325.26] One thing that I'm hoping is they specifically wanted people to start using service workers
[1325.26 → 1329.94] because service workers will be able to better manage this.
[1329.94 → 1334.52] I'm just hoping that it's a little bit intelligent.
[1335.46 → 1335.52] Sure.
[1335.82 → 1342.24] Like if basically Twitch streams is the biggest thing I'm worried about
[1342.24 → 1348.92] because the majority of people that I know that watch Twitch streams do not have that Twitch stream as their main window.
[1349.46 → 1350.62] They're doing something else.
[1351.42 → 1353.24] Hazy, probably making a website.
[1353.90 → 1357.60] Nick, probably sending emails or working on other various things.
[1357.60 → 1360.04] Or just like doing other things at home.
[1360.30 → 1360.60] Yeah.
[1360.98 → 1361.34] Yeah.
[1361.44 → 1363.18] Maybe not even at your computer necessarily.
[1364.12 → 1366.56] I don't even watch that much Twitch streams.
[1366.66 → 1368.84] But if I do, I'm usually also playing a game.
[1369.10 → 1369.34] Yeah.
[1369.48 → 1374.36] And it's often like about the game I'm playing because I'm like, hmm, I wonder if other people are experiencing this thing.
[1374.42 → 1376.12] I really like that about Twitch.
[1376.50 → 1379.30] I can just be like, hmm, I have weird bugs in this section.
[1379.42 → 1382.20] Let me go check out a few other people playing the same game, see if they're having the same thing.
[1382.20 → 1385.94] Everyone watches Twitch in their own way.
[1386.02 → 1388.84] I'm sure there's people watching right now that have this selected as their main window.
[1389.02 → 1392.86] But like I also know there's a huge percentage of people that don't do that.
[1393.44 → 1397.64] And on some devices, that 1% CPU limit thing might actually come into play there.
[1397.64 → 1397.78] Yeah.
[1397.98 → 1406.16] So I just to do like a live test, I opened up Edge and just opened up our stream on source quality.
[1406.80 → 1410.20] And the max it was at was 0.3% of CPU usage.
[1410.34 → 1411.32] But this is a blade.
[1411.58 → 1411.72] Yeah.
[1411.78 → 1415.58] So like, yeah, it's not going to use much CPU on this computer.
[1415.58 → 1423.70] If you're using like a Dell from 2005, it might kind of screw you up a little bit.
[1423.82 → 1424.80] Yeah, that might hurt.
[1424.96 → 1426.06] That might legitimately hurt.
[1426.28 → 1428.66] It's going to really depend on device per device.
[1428.88 → 1436.72] I don't think this is going to warrant like a video, but I think it would be a really cool forum thread if you guys start, once this is out,
[1437.04 → 1443.50] if you guys start discussing like the different effects on your usage in your computer, I think that could be pretty cool.
[1443.50 → 1445.76] Well, Gudrun says use the desktop app.
[1446.32 → 1447.30] Yeah, actually.
[1447.66 → 1448.44] Hey, Gudrun.
[1448.52 → 1450.50] I haven't done this yet, but I'm really interested.
[1450.92 → 1453.42] I think you get it from downloads.twitch.com.
[1453.76 → 1455.66] Can you check that real quick just to make sure?
[1455.82 → 1455.90] Yeah.
[1456.38 → 1457.66] I guess I can too.
[1459.32 → 1460.40] Downloads.com or TV?
[1460.66 → 1461.60] Oh, probably TV.
[1461.74 → 1462.22] Yeah, my bad.
[1465.64 → 1466.04] No.
[1466.38 → 1467.06] Is that not it?
[1467.06 → 1468.80] Gudrun will probably post the proper one.
[1469.74 → 1472.28] Yeah, just post the link in the chat, Gudrun, whenever you have it.
[1472.28 → 1475.04] The desktop app looks super cool, though.
[1475.14 → 1477.28] Some people are saying Firefox Master Race.
[1478.22 → 1482.38] I haven't used Firefox in months because the last time I did, it was like the biggest piece of garbage.
[1482.40 → 1483.62] I was a major fanboy.
[1483.74 → 1487.46] I loved Firefox, and then it just stopped working six months ago.
[1487.66 → 1489.72] App.twitch.tv slash Twitch.
[1490.68 → 1491.46] The Twitch app.
[1491.94 → 1492.54] There you go.
[1493.82 → 1495.04] This is a public server.
[1495.90 → 1498.10] Anyway, we should do this later because we're on the show.
[1498.10 → 1498.46] Yeah.
[1498.62 → 1501.22] But that could be something for sure.
[1501.58 → 1504.44] That would be cool because then Chrome isn't going to meter you.
[1505.00 → 1508.70] I used to be a giant Firefox fanboy, and I don't even use it anymore.
[1508.84 → 1511.52] Firefox was great, and then it wasn't anymore.
[1511.86 → 1513.16] Like, I don't know what else to say.
[1513.22 → 1515.68] It just, like, stopped working entirely for me.
[1515.68 → 1521.62] I think a lot of that had to do with Chrome or Google in general, I guess, pulling their support.
[1521.98 → 1529.20] Because Firefox used to just, like, lavish in the Google money by being like, yes, Google will be our default search engine.
[1529.42 → 1529.56] Yeah.
[1529.78 → 1531.22] And now they don't make nearly as much from that.
[1531.34 → 1537.56] And then I think the reaction to that was to expand and try to do other things.
[1537.56 → 1541.82] And I don't think that worked out for them super well.
[1542.10 → 1542.68] I could be wrong.
[1542.90 → 1544.60] I know they asked something fairly recently.
[1544.88 → 1554.28] Someone in the chat says, it won't throttle media, but I'm searching for media in this article, and I do not see anywhere where it mentions not throttling media.
[1555.96 → 1556.30] Yeah.
[1557.80 → 1558.02] No.
[1558.32 → 1559.02] No mention of it.
[1559.42 → 1559.72] So maybe.
[1559.72 → 1563.56] I know it very specifically mentioned, like, JScript stuff, JavaScript stuff.
[1564.46 → 1565.88] So maybe it won't throttle media.
[1566.00 → 1568.24] Maybe this is all a conversation for naught.
[1568.46 → 1573.04] But if that's not carved out, it could be a potential issue for sure.
[1573.20 → 1573.34] Yeah.
[1573.40 → 1575.78] And again, like I said, discuss this on the forum.
[1575.90 → 1578.44] Once it comes out, try playing media stuff.
[1578.58 → 1587.42] See if you can find a site or a computer that won't play very nicely with different things because it's not new, and it's old and slow and stuff.
[1587.86 → 1591.06] And see if you can get it over 1% in a background tab with media.
[1591.22 → 1592.98] If it doesn't throttle it, then there you go.
[1592.98 → 1594.00] We've solved that problem.
[1594.12 → 1594.60] Figured it out.
[1595.02 → 1599.58] I don't think there's going to be that many things that this is solving, though, if it's not throttling media.
[1600.40 → 1600.58] Yeah.
[1600.66 → 1601.08] I really.
[1602.40 → 1602.66] Personally.
[1602.96 → 1611.28] To be fair, there are a lot of sites that have, like, ads and other crap that use up a lot of your CPU.
[1612.44 → 1616.64] But this doesn't help a lot of people that run, like, ad blocker and all that stuff.
[1616.72 → 1618.36] It's just inhibiting them potentially.
[1618.36 → 1618.80] Yeah.
[1620.62 → 1621.06] Yeah.
[1621.96 → 1622.44] I don't know.
[1622.64 → 1623.62] It's going to be weird.
[1624.44 → 1625.36] Speaking of...
[1625.94 → 1627.16] How can I try this in?
[1627.16 → 1631.36] ...of the dumbest thing I've ever read in the last forever?
[1631.66 → 1632.48] This is hilarious.
[1633.26 → 1636.02] Apparently a very close...
[1636.02 → 1637.22] I hope it's not us.
[1637.84 → 1642.06] Apparently a very close U.S. allay shot down...
[1642.06 → 1642.98] It's probably us.
[1643.98 → 1646.50] Have you, like, read the drone regulations out here?
[1646.94 → 1647.50] It's pretty nuts.
[1647.50 → 1648.74] They're so stupid.
[1648.80 → 1649.50] It's pretty nuts.
[1650.08 → 1653.48] It's, like, you can't fly over, like, 100 feet or something.
[1653.66 → 1660.28] You can't be within, like, this many kilometres of a roadway or a school or an airport.
[1660.48 → 1662.38] Like, and obviously airport makes sense.
[1662.72 → 1671.36] But, like, if you look in a Canadian and specifically B.C. drone regulations, like everything else, B.C. is, like, the dumbest place to live in terms of legislation.
[1671.66 → 1671.88] Yeah.
[1672.92 → 1674.14] They're so stupid.
[1674.14 → 1677.88] B.C. has been described as the wild, wild west of North American politics.
[1677.88 → 1679.48] Yeah, B.C. has also been...
[1679.48 → 1686.22] Well, Vancouver specifically has also been described as no fun city because our legislators are, like, so overbearing.
[1686.50 → 1686.66] Yeah.
[1686.92 → 1687.72] So...
[1687.72 → 1690.14] Anyway, a very close...
[1690.14 → 1691.26] It is said to be very close.
[1691.34 → 1693.16] I know the title doesn't say that, but it's said to be very close.
[1693.58 → 1699.08] U.S. allay shot down a $200 drone with a $3 million Patriot missile.
[1699.08 → 1706.08] I don't think Mexico has snow, so very close is probably...
[1706.08 → 1707.58] Oh, no.
[1707.88 → 1709.84] It's us.
[1709.96 → 1713.30] Okay, I don't know if that's, like, an actual photo of it happening, though.
[1713.30 → 1713.80] It's us.
[1714.16 → 1714.48] It's...
[1714.48 → 1716.06] Well, that's very true.
[1716.64 → 1719.38] But then I would question the accuracy of this article.
[1720.12 → 1720.60] No, I'm just kidding.
[1721.16 → 1722.56] Anyway, let's get on to it.
[1723.40 → 1728.70] One thing that was great is he said that it did a really fantastic job.
[1729.30 → 1731.78] The drone is definitely no longer flying.
[1731.78 → 1732.58] I hope so.
[1733.18 → 1734.10] So, like, there you go.
[1734.26 → 1735.16] Mission accomplished.
[1735.32 → 1736.20] We can all go home.
[1736.30 → 1736.80] That's good.
[1736.80 → 1738.76] He said the...
[1739.32 → 1740.54] It was a gut instinct.
[1741.04 → 1743.88] He said that's an air defence problem because they're in the air.
[1744.00 → 1748.42] So they shot it with a gigantic $3 million missile because they're in the air.
[1748.42 → 1767.86] One thing that was interesting was it was stated, like, if we're going to have these types of reactions to drones, I'm paraphrasing a little bit, one of the easiest ways to, like, fight against North American allies would just be to fly really cheap drones everywhere and have them shoot them with $3 million missiles.
[1767.86 → 1770.00] Then you just bleed them financially.
[1771.60 → 1781.70] Commenting on the return on investment, he said, if I'm the enemy, I'm thinking, hey, I'm going to go on eBay and buy as many of these $300 quadcopters as I can and expend all the Patriot missiles out there.
[1781.70 → 1782.00] Yep.
[1782.00 → 1784.06] Yep.
[1784.38 → 1784.78] Yep.
[1784.82 → 1786.26] That would be a pretty good plan.
[1786.98 → 1793.94] That's like when you're playing Red Alert and you use, like, a really low tier unit to run really close to the tank and then the tank shoots, and it blows itself up.
[1795.04 → 1795.86] Really effective.
[1796.58 → 1797.62] Perfect strategy.
[1797.82 → 1798.42] Red Alert 2.
[1798.80 → 1799.40] Good game.
[1800.44 → 1802.12] I believe that works with siege tanks as well.
[1802.24 → 1802.84] Star craft 2.
[1802.94 → 1803.70] Nobody plays anymore.
[1803.82 → 1804.28] That's fine.
[1804.44 → 1804.96] Moving on.
[1804.96 → 1809.00] I just thought that was hilarious.
[1809.16 → 1809.94] That was in the doc.
[1810.10 → 1813.72] I don't, like, we probably don't have anything else to say there.
[1814.14 → 1816.28] Like, this is not the scope of this show.
[1816.44 → 1816.98] It's just funny.
[1817.12 → 1817.58] How dumb?
[1818.34 → 1818.88] How dumb?
[1819.06 → 1820.08] There's drone in the title.
[1820.26 → 1821.12] So we were like, whatever.
[1821.30 → 1822.12] We'll talk about it.
[1823.18 → 1828.22] Google is looking into revamping ad policies after big brands boycott.
[1828.40 → 1829.96] So this is not surprising.
[1830.14 → 1831.54] They've already moved in this direction.
[1831.54 → 1846.94] This was a freak-out from not that long ago where a bunch of different YouTubers were saying that YouTube is like, oh, they're going to shut us down and all this kind of stuff.
[1848.36 → 1853.22] Oh, for, like, the demonetization based on certain tags and all that stuff that was happening a while ago.
[1853.36 → 1853.76] Yeah.
[1854.52 → 1854.92] Yeah.
[1854.92 → 1874.40] And this, like, there's, this is a really long kind of, not wall of text because it's paragraphed, but, like, the notes in here are talking about how different, like, taxpayer funded ads would be going before extremists or people that are sexists or whatever else.
[1874.40 → 1883.62] The UK government found out that their PSA ads were appearing before videos uploaded by, to quote, rape apologists, anti-Semites, and banned hate preachers.
[1884.20 → 1886.88] So this means that those people are getting money from UK taxpayers.
[1887.76 → 1893.42] Some others were affected, like British supermarket chain Jay, Jay Sands bury Pick.
[1894.28 → 1896.26] That's, like, the most British name for a supermarket.
[1896.26 → 1896.28] I was just going to say.
[1896.80 → 1897.00] Yep.
[1897.00 → 1899.36] Hello, this is Jay Sands bury Pick.
[1899.40 → 1900.56] How may I help you today?
[1901.92 → 1902.80] Hello, governor.
[1903.10 → 1903.40] Wow.
[1903.52 → 1904.62] You want a spot of tea?
[1904.72 → 1905.24] Oh, jeez.
[1905.44 → 1906.96] We just lost all of our British fans.
[1907.68 → 1908.06] Sick.
[1910.36 → 1914.12] They appeared on videos posted by the White Nationalist Polish Defence League.
[1914.62 → 1917.92] The Garden and L'Oréal ads appeared next to extremist and hate-filled videos.
[1917.92 → 1925.20] In response, Google announced changes in ad policy to give clients more control over where their ads appear on YouTube and the Google Display Network would appear in the coming weeks.
[1925.20 → 1927.44] So, Gudrun was, like, banned.
[1929.82 → 1930.22] Sorry.
[1930.50 → 1931.90] I just glanced over and saw that.
[1931.96 → 1932.54] That was fantastic.
[1932.66 → 1935.94] So, I already got my tea, says someone.
[1936.94 → 1952.02] The question then is, how do they ensure that this isn't going to essentially blur the lines of comedy, which is something that's been happening lately a lot with the whole PewDiePie thing?
[1952.02 → 1962.14] Um, so, is the advertising policy going to make a determination between what is held as a joke, and what is held as someone's opinion?
[1962.30 → 1964.10] How are they supposed to make those determinations?
[1964.36 → 1966.62] Obviously, that's an extremely difficult thing to do.
[1966.62 → 1970.42] Um, so, yeah, it's just any time.
[1971.68 → 1982.80] Obviously, there has to be, you know, limits set in place once YouTube or something like YouTube gets to the level that it's at now where it's so huge that these giant brands are advertising.
[1982.92 → 1984.00] They have to do something.
[1984.42 → 1989.20] They have to do something about a lot of the content that goes on the platform.
[1989.20 → 1999.96] And there's different, like, just to chirp in here for a second, if you have, like, a late night comedy special, and it gets a little racy, and you say some kind of edgy stuff, that's great.
[2000.10 → 2004.32] But you have late night TV ads going with that.
[2004.70 → 2008.64] There are certain brands that aren't going to want to go on your edgy comedy special.
[2008.68 → 2009.02] Totally.
[2009.02 → 2010.88] This is talking about, like, TV stuff.
[2011.40 → 2013.64] And I completely get it.
[2013.70 → 2016.90] If I was an advertiser, I wouldn't want my ads going on certain videos.
[2017.08 → 2018.06] I understand that.
[2018.76 → 2025.66] I think it's going to take a lot of work on YouTube's end to make this work well.
[2025.74 → 2032.84] And the concerning part is look what happened with the like, copyright claim system on YouTube for however many years.
[2033.08 → 2033.32] Yeah.
[2033.44 → 2035.38] That should have taken a lot of work.
[2036.06 → 2038.52] Instead, they were like, automate it.
[2038.76 → 2038.94] Yeah.
[2039.44 → 2040.00] Screw them.
[2040.44 → 2041.06] Automate it.
[2041.46 → 2050.60] So if they take the same kind of approach, which I'm not necessarily saying that they're going to do, it could turn out to be, you know, very concerning for some creators.
[2050.60 → 2063.26] Because there are creators out there who do take that kind of very rash approach to comedy that could be perceived as hate speech and all that stuff.
[2063.54 → 2064.60] So just to –
[2064.60 → 2077.30] And that's just, like, to the people that are doing just edgy comedy stuff, this might be a time for – not that I'm in necessarily a position to tell you how to run your company.
[2077.30 → 2081.72] But this might be a time to reach out and try to do other things to make money.
[2082.36 → 2084.16] Try to diversify your income.
[2084.26 → 2086.22] No, because being a YouTuber is scary.
[2086.44 → 2090.06] Sometimes policy changes happen, and you can just lose everything from under you.
[2090.12 → 2090.72] It's crazy.
[2090.72 → 2103.30] So before this comes in, and you potentially get flagged as someone that they don't want, like, having ads going through your channel for these different brands, maybe try to figure it out.
[2103.30 → 2105.78] Maybe start selling some edgy shirts, man.
[2106.60 → 2107.64] People like edgy shirts.
[2108.04 → 2110.56] I'm sure that it's not going to be, like, a blanket policy.
[2110.72 → 2111.36] I'm sure that it's –
[2111.36 → 2111.52] Yeah.
[2111.64 → 2115.32] Like they're saying, if we can go by what's been said so far –
[2115.32 → 2116.82] It seems like pretty extreme cases.
[2117.08 → 2117.92] It's going to be extreme cases.
[2118.08 → 2122.54] There's going to be dashboard applications where advertisers can kind of specify what they want.
[2122.54 → 2129.20] And as long as it all gets implemented like that, I think it's great because what that does is it lends confidence to the platform.
[2129.68 → 2136.98] It gives these larger brands, you know, more peace of mind that they're advertising on stuff that they would want associated with their brand.
[2137.46 → 2146.54] And it just grows the entire industry because that's something that, you know, we've been working on for the last however many years now is, like, legitimizing the industry.
[2146.54 → 2148.78] And it's finally sort of getting to that point.
[2148.78 → 2160.00] Another weird way to look at it is it might even be better for the other side because if you're on YouTube, and you're really into watching your white nationalist thing,
[2160.10 → 2163.94] you might not want to watch an ad for a company that supports all these things that you don't like.
[2164.42 → 2166.82] For Jay Salisbury's PLC.
[2167.52 → 2169.98] Maybe you don't like that supermarket.
[2170.58 → 2172.14] I don't know.
[2172.98 → 2174.92] This could be better for everyone.
[2175.10 → 2175.62] I don't know.
[2175.64 → 2175.98] Potentially.
[2176.18 → 2177.20] I hope it is.
[2177.26 → 2178.16] It's a weird way of looking at it.
[2178.16 → 2180.10] So Nitro corrected me in the chat.
[2180.18 → 2182.44] Apparently it's not PIC.
[2182.60 → 2186.38] It's PLC, which stands for Public Limited Company, which I didn't know.
[2186.82 → 2189.62] Up here we call them LTDs or corporations or inks.
[2190.28 → 2190.72] Inks.
[2193.32 → 2193.76] Inks.
[2196.06 → 2198.04] So they just call it Sainsbury's.
[2198.98 → 2199.50] Sainsbury's.
[2199.76 → 2200.28] Sainsbury's.
[2200.32 → 2201.04] That's still like.
[2201.16 → 2201.68] Sainsbury's.
[2201.72 → 2203.60] That's still the most British supermarket ever.
[2203.94 → 2203.96] Very British.
[2204.70 → 2205.94] At least to us.
[2205.94 → 2208.08] Who are we to talk to?
[2208.08 → 2209.82] We're not exactly an authority on things that sound.
[2209.82 → 2213.14] We go to the good old real Canadian superstore.
[2214.76 → 2217.08] We're going to go get some cheese.
[2217.42 → 2219.78] It's literally called the real Canadian superstore.
[2219.88 → 2221.16] And we're going to get some potatoes.
[2221.72 → 2223.88] And we're going to put them all together and make some Putin.
[2224.82 → 2225.78] Have you guys ever seen.
[2225.88 → 2226.12] Okay.
[2226.52 → 2226.88] Putin.
[2227.14 → 2227.58] It's pronounced routine.
[2227.76 → 2228.02] Putin.
[2228.26 → 2230.42] What the heck was that?
[2230.42 → 2233.84] I don't know if you guys know this.
[2233.98 → 2235.54] We're going to go off-topic here for a second.
[2236.18 → 2249.04] But different brands will differentiate their American and Canadian branches just by hiding little maple leafs in their marketing.
[2249.04 → 2252.72] And one of the easiest ones to tell is with Wendy's.
[2252.86 → 2254.98] And you can see it because like the apostrophe.
[2255.94 → 2256.42] You see that?
[2256.52 → 2258.08] It's just a little maple leaf.
[2260.02 → 2261.68] And that's a super Canadian thing.
[2262.06 → 2264.26] We're not going to stand out too much.
[2264.60 → 2266.14] We're not going to try to hurt anybody's feelings.
[2266.52 → 2268.76] We just want the apostrophe.
[2269.00 → 2272.64] If you could just make the apostrophe a little maple leaf, we'd just be so happy.
[2273.36 → 2274.22] That's all we need.
[2274.34 → 2279.40] After we go out there and play some stick and puck, you know, we're going to go down to the good old Wendy's.
[2279.46 → 2281.74] We're going to get ourselves a Canadian burger.
[2282.52 → 2284.22] And I don't even know what this accent is.
[2284.26 → 2285.30] It's like half like.
[2285.40 → 2286.02] It's a little weird.
[2286.02 → 2291.34] It's like half like Southern, half Ontarian, like half Norwegian.
[2291.74 → 2292.00] Sure.
[2292.90 → 2293.20] Yeah.
[2293.38 → 2294.38] Throw that one in there.
[2294.50 → 2294.84] Anyway.
[2297.50 → 2299.70] Speaking of which, if you want to watch a.
[2299.86 → 2301.74] I'm just going to throw a recommendation in here.
[2301.74 → 2303.88] A hilarious series.
[2304.52 → 2309.56] Maybe if you're 18 and above because they use some like harsh language and other various things.
[2309.74 → 2310.74] But Letter Kenny.
[2311.14 → 2312.90] It's about like Canadian hicks.
[2313.00 → 2313.94] Is that actually funny?
[2314.22 → 2314.50] Okay.
[2316.74 → 2319.92] It requires a certain sense of humour, but I find it entertaining.
[2320.32 → 2322.42] Because I watched like they started on YouTube, right?
[2322.52 → 2322.70] Yeah.
[2322.88 → 2324.74] So I watched like a couple of things, and it's like.
[2325.28 → 2326.56] It's very different.
[2326.92 → 2327.48] Some of its funny.
[2327.48 → 2332.46] It just feels like they're like making the same jokes over and over and over and over and over again.
[2333.64 → 2335.48] If you're watching Letter Kenny Problems.
[2336.36 → 2336.72] Maybe.
[2336.88 → 2344.26] Which is like the series that's on YouTube, which I think is like one through six episodes of like just them standing in front of the camera giving like essentially one-liners.
[2344.46 → 2344.66] Yeah.
[2344.92 → 2345.14] Yeah.
[2345.14 → 2346.20] That's not what the show is.
[2346.36 → 2346.60] Okay.
[2347.10 → 2350.72] The show is like it has story progression and character development and like all this kind of stuff.
[2351.12 → 2353.02] I'm just I'm trying to think of what they always say.
[2353.18 → 2354.08] Like what?
[2354.30 → 2354.80] Peter patter?
[2355.04 → 2355.88] Let's get at her.
[2356.00 → 2356.22] Yeah.
[2356.60 → 2356.92] It's like.
[2357.02 → 2357.08] Peter patter?
[2357.14 → 2357.62] Let's get at her.
[2359.50 → 2362.08] Just like the most hit Canadian thing ever.
[2362.18 → 2362.72] I love it.
[2362.72 → 2366.30] My favourite one by far is your 10 ply, bud.
[2367.20 → 2370.58] The idea there is that two-ply toilet paper is already soft.
[2370.58 → 2371.80] Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[2371.80 → 2374.82] So 10 ply toilet paper would be ridiculously soft.
[2375.28 → 2376.22] And you're just way too soft.
[2376.22 → 2378.24] Speaking of pitter-patter, let's get at her.
[2378.58 → 2379.88] Everyone wants us to move on.
[2380.22 → 2381.16] So ad spots?
[2382.00 → 2384.36] I mean, I was going to say another topic.
[2384.72 → 2385.66] Bitter patter, let's get at her.
[2385.90 → 2387.06] Bitter patter, let's get at her.
[2387.12 → 2388.84] Before we do ad spots, do you want to do flow plane?
[2390.16 → 2390.52] Nope.
[2390.52 → 2395.90] I don't have that set up this second because that's set up on Linus' laptop.
[2396.06 → 2396.42] All right.
[2396.54 → 2397.50] So let's do ad spots.
[2397.64 → 2398.52] Float planes a thing.
[2399.10 → 2399.36] Yeah.
[2399.72 → 2401.38] Let's just talk, but we don't need to show it.
[2401.62 → 2401.86] Sure.
[2402.24 → 2402.92] I just don't know what.
[2403.04 → 2403.62] Oh, there you go.
[2403.68 → 2403.98] Perfect.
[2404.48 → 2405.26] Float planes a thing.
[2405.44 → 2405.66] Yeah.
[2405.72 → 2406.42] It's pretty great.
[2406.60 → 2406.76] Yeah.
[2407.12 → 2408.56] Streaming usually works.
[2408.70 → 2409.44] Not always.
[2410.14 → 2410.82] Usually, though.
[2410.94 → 2411.78] It's been pretty good lately.
[2411.78 → 2416.26] Don't read the fine print of which there is none that says that it sometimes works and hopefully
[2416.26 → 2418.56] works, but then you can download it if it doesn't work.
[2418.56 → 2423.84] When you sign up for float plane, there's like a hopefully this will work section that includes
[2423.84 → 2424.22] streaming.
[2424.42 → 2425.00] Well, there you go.
[2425.04 → 2428.46] But like a very high percentage of the time streaming works.
[2429.02 → 2430.68] Not always.
[2430.84 → 2431.34] Not always.
[2431.38 → 2432.68] But a very high percentage of the time.
[2432.68 → 2440.14] So anyway, on float plane, we have the Silverstone.
[2440.14 → 2441.66] This one just went up last night.
[2441.84 → 2445.02] The Silverstone headphone stand project conclusion.
[2445.42 → 2445.94] Oh, dang.
[2446.34 → 2447.18] When did that start?
[2447.18 → 2447.48] Two years later.
[2447.64 → 2447.86] Yeah.
[2447.96 → 2448.26] Okay.
[2448.60 → 2448.86] Woo.
[2449.00 → 2450.46] So the conclusion to a project.
[2450.46 → 2451.28] It's actually pretty funny.
[2451.38 → 2452.56] Nice little vlog going on.
[2452.60 → 2453.16] Nice little vlog.
[2453.34 → 2453.50] Yeah.
[2453.50 → 2456.62] We reviewed an 18-month-old device.
[2457.38 → 2457.86] Hell yeah.
[2457.92 → 2458.80] The Surface Pro 4.
[2458.98 → 2459.52] Why not?
[2459.82 → 2463.72] Because the price recently dropped, and we were like, should you buy it, or should you wait
[2463.72 → 2464.46] for SP5?
[2464.82 → 2465.14] Okay.
[2465.52 → 2465.78] Yeah.
[2466.22 → 2466.96] Which should you do?
[2466.96 → 2467.02] There you go.
[2467.02 → 2473.76] I'm actually waiting to see this video because for my mom's work, she wants like a tablet-y
[2473.76 → 2474.32] kind of thingy.
[2474.44 → 2476.12] And I'm like, maybe a Surface.
[2476.88 → 2477.24] Apparently.
[2477.24 → 2477.66] Because it's powerful.
[2477.66 → 2480.66] Well, you'll have to watch to find out how it is.
[2481.14 → 2481.22] Yeah.
[2481.90 → 2483.42] Luckily, float pay member.
[2485.00 → 2486.30] Benefits of the job.
[2486.54 → 2487.62] So I'll be able to watch that one now.
[2487.68 → 2490.62] There is also the MSI Trident 3 desktop review.
[2490.70 → 2496.56] So if you guys remember that little tiny console killer thing from CES that we checked out at
[2496.56 → 2497.26] MSI's booth.
[2497.58 → 2498.16] Got it.
[2498.26 → 2499.56] Got a full review going on.
[2499.56 → 2503.94] And then there's also a very, very light laptop.
[2503.94 → 2508.80] You might even say it's only some grams of weight.
[2509.22 → 2509.68] Oh, dang.
[2509.76 → 2511.12] That's on there as well.
[2511.20 → 2512.66] So we got a lot of good content over there.
[2512.66 → 2516.68] One thing from the Tech Wiki side that I want to drop real quick is the like, we passed a
[2516.68 → 2519.30] million subscribers, got a golden play button.
[2520.04 → 2522.00] Here's like the history of Tech Wiki.
[2522.68 → 2523.58] It didn't include everything.
[2523.70 → 2527.76] It didn't have my 15-minute scripts in it, which made me a little sad, but it's okay.
[2528.88 → 2532.70] But if you're a fan of John, he hosts that video.
[2532.70 → 2533.32] He hosts it.
[2533.54 → 2533.80] Yeah.
[2534.18 → 2536.22] So it's cool.
[2536.38 → 2537.34] I actually really liked that video.
[2537.44 → 2542.34] There are multiple times where I burst out laughing, which is not that common because I've been
[2542.34 → 2545.28] on the internet for a long time and my soul is old and numb.
[2546.22 → 2547.90] But yeah, it's very funny.
[2548.08 → 2549.02] It's very well done.
[2549.48 → 2550.82] The skit at the end is funny.
[2552.38 → 2553.64] The whole thing is good.
[2553.82 → 2554.62] I recommend checking that out.
[2554.62 → 2559.16] So if you love John and you love TechQuiki, and especially if you love Dennis.
[2560.02 → 2560.78] Dennis is in it too.
[2560.86 → 2562.52] Then you should go check that out.
[2562.58 → 2563.78] So anyway, Float plane, it's great.
[2563.92 → 2566.00] We release new videos all the time, every day.
[2566.98 → 2569.76] If you're having trouble finding it, go to the linustectips.com forum.

[2572.14 → 2572.56] Click on that.
[2572.62 → 2573.10] You'll figure it out.
[2573.28 → 2573.54] All right.

[2601.74 → 2602.28] It's built in.
[2602.62 → 2603.06] Templates.
[2603.26 → 2603.64] Boom.

[2608.92 → 2609.80] You can sell stuff.
[2610.34 → 2611.32] We went over that one.
[2611.70 → 2612.10] We're good.
[2612.20 → 2612.82] Cover page.
[2613.44 → 2618.78] You can have one really beautiful, like, modern website-looking scrollable page with everything
[2618.78 → 2619.42] on it that you need.
[2619.48 → 2620.14] Linus hates those.
[2620.22 → 2620.70] That's fine.
[2620.88 → 2621.20] Domains?
[2621.20 → 2621.50] They're cool.

[2623.24 → 2624.04] You get a free domain.
[2624.18 → 2625.04] It just comes with it.
[2625.12 → 2625.98] It's packaged in.
[2626.06 → 2627.12] Don't have to worry about it.
[2627.36 → 2628.52] Everything taken care of.

[2632.02 → 2632.50] Thing.

[2635.78 → 2636.22] Squarespace.
[2636.22 → 2636.28] Yeah.
[2636.28 → 2636.58] I'm not sure.
[2636.58 → 2636.78] I'm not sure.
[2636.78 → 2637.28] I'm not sure.
[2637.28 → 2637.62] Sort of.
[2637.62 → 2638.62] Make your move, I think.
[2638.62 → 2641.78] Make your next move or make your next website or something.
[2641.78 → 2643.62] Make your next move on a website thing.
[2643.62 → 2645.42] Sorry we got your slogan wrong.
[2645.42 → 2645.88] It's okay.
[2645.88 → 2646.16] Or right.
[2646.30 → 2646.80] It's what we do.
[2646.80 → 2647.26] We might have gotten it right.
[2647.28 → 2647.70] It's what we do.

[2656.02 → 2656.30] Squarespace.
[2656.80 → 2657.08] Squarespace.
[2657.08 → 2659.62] But FreshBooks.
[2660.68 → 2664.78] So you're making so much money because you just set up this Squarespace site.
[2664.86 → 2664.98] Yeah.
[2665.06 → 2666.32] And you set up the commerce module.
[2666.66 → 2668.76] Man, I got stuff coming in.
[2668.96 → 2673.18] People are buying services and orders and items and all these different kind of things.
[2673.26 → 2674.54] I need to manage my time.
[2674.64 → 2678.04] I need to manage the invoices for the supplies I need to buy to do these jobs.
[2678.24 → 2679.28] You need to manage your website.
[2679.28 → 2684.92] Have different receipts that I need to be able to take photos of and manage my expenses.
[2685.24 → 2686.80] You can do that through FreshBooks.
[2686.94 → 2687.20] You can.
[2687.26 → 2688.30] You can invoice people.
[2688.54 → 2688.94] You can.
[2688.98 → 2690.30] You can see when they read it.
[2690.70 → 2695.02] So they can't come to you and be like, hey, I didn't get the invoice.
[2695.12 → 2697.88] You're like, I gave you that invoice.
[2698.00 → 2698.76] I got proof.
[2699.46 → 2700.34] It's in FreshBooks.
[2701.20 → 2702.62] So yeah, no big deal.
[2702.70 → 2703.12] It's fine.
[2703.20 → 2706.12] You can set up invoices in like almost no time at all.
[2706.38 → 2707.16] Send those off.
[2707.52 → 2707.94] No big deal.
[2707.94 → 2709.98] Obviously, it can't be literally no time at all.
[2710.98 → 2712.18] I mean, it's pretty close.
[2712.18 → 2713.32] Maybe they'll get there one day.
[2713.54 → 2714.04] It's pretty close.
[2714.06 → 2716.28] They're constantly optimizing, making things better.
[2716.42 → 2717.02] So who knows?
[2717.14 → 2718.46] The sky's the limit with these guys.
[2718.72 → 2721.88] They have a mobile app with all the functionality of the desktop app.
[2721.96 → 2723.72] So if you're on the go, you can just keep moving.
[2723.96 → 2724.56] No big deal.
[2724.68 → 2725.34] Don't have to stop.
[2725.48 → 2726.06] It's all fine.
[2726.12 → 2727.74] You can take FreshBooks with you everywhere.
[2728.00 → 2729.82] If you have questions, feel free to reach out.

[2752.36 → 2752.76] Boom.
[2753.00 → 2753.26] Cool.
[2753.94 → 2754.88] Hype ad spots.
[2755.04 → 2755.50] I like it.
[2755.86 → 2756.26] FreshBooks.
[2756.42 → 2757.10] Should be a new thing.
[2757.54 → 2757.86] Squarespace.
[2757.86 → 2758.02] Squarespace.
[2758.02 → 2761.04] What do we have left?
[2761.20 → 2762.28] There were a few interesting things.
[2763.26 → 2765.66] Nintendo is like doubling production of the Switch.
[2765.88 → 2766.10] Yeah.
[2766.28 → 2766.68] Apparently.
[2767.08 → 2767.36] Yeah.
[2767.54 → 2770.58] Which is like, there isn't really anything to really say about that.
[2771.58 → 2778.98] On account of strong demand, the company reported that now plans to manufacture at least 16 million consoles over the fiscal year starting April 1st, which is twice its initial plan.
[2778.98 → 2782.86] So I guess they didn't have very high expectations to begin with.
[2782.86 → 2782.96] Yeah.
[2783.32 → 2786.34] Well, like, it's sort of a Zelda machine right now.
[2786.60 → 2789.82] Someone posted an interesting infographic, which I don't have.
[2790.02 → 2790.24] Okay.
[2790.32 → 2794.14] I hate how I always have these revelations during the show instead of before the show.
[2794.70 → 2796.78] Super, super helpful for everyone.
[2797.06 → 2797.28] Great job.
[2797.28 → 2802.66] But it was all the launch titles for all Nintendo consoles throughout their history.
[2802.98 → 2803.14] Yeah.
[2803.18 → 2808.38] And it was interesting seeing how my favourite consoles so far have had, like, not very many launch titles.
[2808.38 → 2810.86] Like, N64 had, like, two or three.
[2811.76 → 2814.00] And Super Nintendo had not very many at all as well.
[2814.38 → 2816.04] At least NA launch titles.
[2816.54 → 2816.78] Yeah.
[2816.96 → 2817.36] That's true.
[2817.48 → 2822.16] They might have had more, like, JP launch titles or whatever, but not very many NA ones.
[2823.66 → 2827.52] I also, while I was on my trip in Boston, a lot of people had Switches.
[2828.32 → 2829.30] That's not that surprising.
[2829.50 → 2830.14] That was a thing.
[2830.14 → 2831.14] Because you were running PAX East.
[2831.42 → 2832.28] No, I know, but still.
[2832.52 → 2832.62] Yeah.
[2832.62 → 2836.08] Like, it was, especially because they were relatively hard to even buy.
[2836.34 → 2836.58] True.
[2836.58 → 2843.30] It was interesting to see people liked it, liked Zelda, I guess, that much to, like, kind
[2843.30 → 2844.66] of haul it around with them all the time.
[2844.84 → 2847.60] When it's not that easy.
[2847.80 → 2849.38] It's not as easy as a 3DS or something.
[2849.46 → 2849.70] No.
[2849.80 → 2850.86] You can't just throw it in your pocket.
[2851.00 → 2852.68] You need to bring, like, a dedicated bag for it.
[2852.70 → 2856.02] Or have one of those ginormous carrying cases, which are, like, legitimately this big.
[2856.78 → 2859.44] Which is just, like, a little bit cumbersome.
[2859.74 → 2862.90] Get one if you're going to get a Switch, because the screens are sketchy.
[2862.90 → 2865.56] And, like, scratch up really easily.
[2865.78 → 2867.98] Like, in the dock.
[2868.32 → 2873.40] It seems like a lot of their stuff is going to have quality control issues with that.
[2873.50 → 2880.40] Because I know there were also the issues that brand realized with the coding on both
[2880.40 → 2883.68] the Joy-Cons and the console itself.
[2883.68 → 2884.66] Or just not very durable.
[2884.66 → 2887.82] Sod brand would put a skin on it, take it off, and it would just slowly wear away.
[2888.10 → 2893.56] To be fair, they said it was over many applications and removals.
[2894.18 → 2895.76] But still, it should last.
[2895.78 → 2898.46] That doesn't happen on a huge amount of other devices.
[2898.64 → 2901.66] And, like, the N64 is still relevant.
[2902.42 → 2903.26] Like, not relevant.
[2903.36 → 2906.12] But it's still possibly in good shape today if you have one.
[2906.18 → 2906.32] Yep.
[2907.00 → 2910.12] Do you think that your Switch is going to last however many years?
[2910.22 → 2910.44] 20, 25 years?
[2910.44 → 2912.94] Legitimately don't if you're actually using it.
[2913.06 → 2916.90] Especially because in different modes, I should say.
[2917.14 → 2918.48] Going in and out of the dock.
[2918.76 → 2920.32] I should have covered this in my video.
[2920.54 → 2922.96] I didn't have any problems with it, which is why I didn't.
[2923.26 → 2924.40] But I did notice it.
[2924.74 → 2926.64] I just also noticed I didn't have any problems with it.
[2926.68 → 2927.48] So I didn't bring it up.
[2927.92 → 2933.74] But when you go to rail in your Switch into the dock,
[2934.16 → 2938.36] there's what looks like rubber pads that you would like sliding along.
[2938.58 → 2939.20] They're plastic.
[2939.20 → 2941.62] So you go to, like, slide it in.
[2941.70 → 2943.08] And it slides against that.
[2943.28 → 2944.56] And it scratches the screen.
[2944.90 → 2944.94] What?
[2945.40 → 2946.68] It shouldn't matter.
[2948.24 → 2949.26] But it has been.
[2949.56 → 2952.50] So, like, the one time I've docked mine since I got it.
[2952.54 → 2953.88] Because I don't have a screen protector on it yet.
[2954.14 → 2954.90] I'm getting one.
[2955.00 → 2955.50] I'm getting one.
[2955.54 → 2956.10] I just don't have it yet.
[2956.46 → 2959.14] I, like, pressed it against the back of the dock.
[2959.20 → 2960.98] And then slid it in, which is something you can do.
[2961.12 → 2962.92] So that the screen doesn't touch the front.
[2963.02 → 2963.20] Sure.
[2963.24 → 2964.64] There's enough gap there that it's fine.
[2964.64 → 2969.26] And then once it was plugged in, I, like, lightly let go of it so that it just, like, rested against it.
[2969.30 → 2969.96] And then everything was okay.
[2970.16 → 2971.72] I just do not want to scratch it.
[2971.80 → 2973.34] The dock is just aesthetic, right?
[2974.82 → 2975.22] Basically.
[2975.94 → 2978.18] It's a glorified USB hub.
[2978.28 → 2979.30] That's so, like...
[2979.30 → 2980.50] That holds the Switch.
[2980.92 → 2982.28] Oh, man.
[2982.60 → 2982.74] Yeah.
[2982.74 → 2988.06] To correct my statement from a couple of minutes ago, the N64 was released in 96.
[2988.42 → 2989.38] At least mine's plastic.
[2989.82 → 2990.24] 96.
[2991.04 → 2991.80] That's crazy.
[2991.94 → 2993.00] That is actually pretty crazy.
[2993.36 → 2994.36] So 21 years ago.
[2994.98 → 2997.16] Which is actually pretty nuts.
[2999.22 → 3003.72] Not official estimates suggest the Switch sold about 1.5 million units in its first week.
[3003.96 → 3009.56] And that compares to 13.5 million Wii U units sold in the entire four-year run of the console.
[3011.02 → 3011.42] Okay.
[3011.42 → 3013.86] But the thing is, like...
[3013.86 → 3015.14] And I watched someone's video.
[3015.38 → 3022.06] Because someone was like, okay, a lot of people around the Switch launch are talking about how badly represented the Wii U was.
[3022.18 → 3023.88] Because no one knew what the heck it was.
[3024.02 → 3024.24] Sure.
[3024.38 → 3026.30] So he was like, okay, let's do a retrospective.
[3026.50 → 3027.88] And look at how bad it actually was.
[3028.20 → 3032.94] Watching the press launches and stuff, even I'm sitting there going, like, what is this?
[3033.08 → 3033.26] Yeah.
[3033.72 → 3035.82] They never show the actual console.
[3035.92 → 3037.30] They just show the tablet-y thing.
[3038.30 → 3039.84] Like, it's actually really weird.
[3039.84 → 3041.04] The whole thing is very weird.
[3041.04 → 3044.52] I remember, like, even myself being confused as to what it was.
[3044.62 → 3046.96] Being like, is this just, like, an addition for the Wii?
[3047.16 → 3047.36] Yeah.
[3048.30 → 3050.32] It was very, very odd.
[3050.48 → 3057.26] And, like, the press conference for the Switch wasn't the best press conference I've ever seen, by any means.
[3057.26 → 3059.74] But you understood what it was.
[3059.94 → 3060.12] Yeah.
[3060.12 → 3062.18] You absolutely knew what the Switch was.
[3062.24 → 3063.48] There were no questions about it.
[3063.54 → 3064.62] You knew what the Joy-Cons were.
[3064.88 → 3065.76] You knew what the Switch was.
[3066.00 → 3067.24] You knew there were three different modes.
[3067.48 → 3069.18] Handheld, tabletop, docked.
[3069.50 → 3071.46] You knew Zelda was coming on it.
[3071.54 → 3072.76] Like, you knew all the facts.
[3073.30 → 3074.42] And that's what really mattered.
[3074.48 → 3075.78] That was not a thing with the Wii U.
[3075.92 → 3080.84] To the point where, even now, I'll, like, talk to people about the Wii U.
[3080.90 → 3082.88] And they're like, oh, man, I really want to play Breath of the Wild.
[3083.14 → 3087.08] But I don't want to play, buy an entire system just to play Breath of the Wild.
[3087.20 → 3087.38] Yep.
[3087.56 → 3089.78] And I'm like, do you have someone you can, like, borrow Wii U off of?
[3090.00 → 3094.46] Or, like, go to Willow, which isn't available for most people, and, like, see if you can rent a Wii U.
[3095.22 → 3096.38] And they're like, what?
[3096.52 → 3098.06] Like, it's on the Wii?
[3098.36 → 3099.48] I'm like, no, it's on the Wii U.
[3100.04 → 3101.48] They're like, oh, so you have to get the tablet thing?
[3101.54 → 3105.18] I'm like, no, it's a different console.
[3106.06 → 3108.76] It had a really cool version of Mario Kart, and I liked it.
[3109.58 → 3111.04] Wii U is actually pretty sick.
[3111.04 → 3121.52] Speaking of Mario Kart, like, I'm wondering if they're overproducing at this point, if they're doubling their plan to 16 million consoles over this year.
[3121.98 → 3123.86] Because what do they have coming out?
[3124.24 → 3135.94] Breath of the Wild, anyone who wanted to get a Switch for Breath of the Wild has probably either got one already or just given up and bought Breath of the Wild on Wii U.
[3136.14 → 3136.40] Right.
[3136.84 → 3137.52] That's what I did.
[3137.52 → 3138.72] I just bought it on the Wii U.
[3138.86 → 3139.38] Very good.
[3139.38 → 3142.76] Like, yes, there's some stuttering in towns and stuff.
[3142.78 → 3144.42] There's some stuttering on the Switch as well.
[3144.56 → 3145.28] That's, yeah.
[3145.50 → 3148.36] So it's not like it's a Wii U issue.
[3148.54 → 3149.76] People are still playing it over there.
[3151.58 → 3152.48] What's coming out?
[3152.76 → 3155.50] A re-skinned or not even re-skinned Mario Kart 8?
[3156.42 → 3156.82] Yeah.
[3157.54 → 3159.46] Mario Kart 8 with additional content or something?
[3159.60 → 3161.58] It's, no, I wouldn't call it a re-skin.
[3162.08 → 3163.88] I think it's, yeah.
[3163.98 → 3164.92] There are some things that have changed.
[3164.92 → 3166.06] Mario Kart with additional content.
[3166.26 → 3166.42] Yeah.
[3166.60 → 3170.14] But a game that's already been released and then, like, two other games.
[3170.14 → 3172.06] To be fair, most Mario Karts are pretty similar.
[3173.08 → 3176.82] And there's, like, there's some, it's just not as different as most of them are.
[3176.92 → 3177.16] Sure.
[3177.40 → 3178.98] But, like, there are more courses.
[3179.32 → 3180.24] There are more riders.
[3181.14 → 3183.48] There's this new, like, training wheels mode thing.
[3183.48 → 3185.48] Like, there are some things that are changing.
[3185.62 → 3189.50] I'm just curious where they think 16 million units of demand is going to come from.
[3190.06 → 3190.22] Yeah.
[3190.34 → 3194.34] Well, like, I'm expecting Smash will come out.
[3194.34 → 3196.12] Smash for Wii U took, like, three years.
[3196.74 → 3197.18] Did it seriously?
[3197.30 → 3197.50] Two.
[3197.96 → 3198.60] Something like that.
[3198.82 → 3199.00] Yeah.
[3199.42 → 3204.62] So I'm, you know, maybe they have plans that we don't know about yet.
[3205.02 → 3208.38] Maybe they're going to be doing, like, massive virtual console stuff.
[3208.46 → 3210.66] I know that's been a huge point of discussion.
[3210.78 → 3210.96] Yeah.
[3210.96 → 3217.30] So maybe they're, like, hey, yeah, we're going to have, like, Super Metro id and all this other, like, Mario 64.
[3218.26 → 3218.66] Yeah.
[3219.14 → 3224.18] Stuff that you can play through their online monthly subscription plan or whatever it is that they're doing.
[3225.34 → 3227.26] Maybe that's where they think the demand is going to come from.
[3227.86 → 3233.04] I would probably get one if a lot of those old games were on that and exclusively available through the Switch.
[3234.20 → 3237.90] But, yeah, E3 announcements, people are saying that's possible for sure.
[3237.90 → 3238.30] Yeah.
[3240.48 → 3244.48] It'll just be interesting to see because hopefully they'll have more stuff by holiday season.
[3244.58 → 3247.86] Otherwise, I don't know where they're going to sell 16 million Switches.
[3247.96 → 3252.78] Another big one is Super Mario Odyssey is coming out for holiday season.
[3253.60 → 3253.74] Yeah.
[3253.82 → 3256.44] So people are interested in it right now because of Zelda.
[3257.30 → 3259.90] And then Mario Kart's coming out in, like, not that long.
[3259.96 → 3261.34] But it's not a new game, whatever.
[3261.56 → 3262.50] It's going to be kind of weird.
[3262.50 → 3267.42] I don't think a huge wave of people are going to buy Switches for Mario Kart.
[3267.86 → 3269.32] I don't really see that happening.
[3270.10 → 3277.00] Especially now that we've seen how, to be honest, crappy the single Joy-Con experiences.
[3277.30 → 3277.44] Yeah.
[3277.80 → 3283.74] Because half of that was like, oh, you can do – I think they showed split screen, right, for Mario Kart 8?
[3283.74 → 3283.82] Yeah.
[3284.10 → 3284.72] Yeah, I think so.
[3284.72 → 3287.46] So you can do split screen on, like, an airplane with your friends playing Mario Kart 8.
[3287.46 → 3288.72] I legit don't want to do that.
[3288.72 → 3292.64] Like, I tried the whole Joy-Con, and I was like, wow, this is total trash.
[3292.86 → 3293.06] Yeah.
[3293.48 → 3294.42] Like, legitimate.
[3294.72 → 3298.54] I am very uninterested in playing Mario Kart on one Joy-Con.
[3298.54 → 3299.36] On one Joy-Con.
[3299.56 → 3300.86] It's so uncomfortable.
[3301.18 → 3305.74] So maybe they'll have other more comfortable Joy-Cons coming down the line?
[3305.84 → 3306.46] I doubt that.
[3306.50 → 3307.08] I don't think so.
[3307.22 → 3308.36] But –
[3308.36 → 3314.22] Some people have made, like, 3D-printed adapter things that you can rail in that make it better.
[3314.22 → 3318.36] But for me, it's just the proximity of the buttons and the –
[3318.36 → 3318.94] Yeah, no, exactly.
[3318.94 → 3319.60] The bad thumb stick.
[3319.74 → 3321.58] How did that make it through?
[3321.80 → 3322.76] Yeah, I don't know.
[3323.18 → 3324.16] I don't understand.
[3324.44 → 3324.80] Anyway.
[3325.14 → 3325.84] So, yeah.
[3326.02 → 3329.42] I hope – I wish them the best because I like Nintendo.
[3329.42 → 3335.62] If Super Mario Odyssey knocks it out of the park, I think they'll be in a pretty good spot.
[3336.02 → 3345.46] Because then, like, parents for kids who didn't want to buy a Switch right now because buying a Switch and Zelda is actually quite an investment.
[3345.58 → 3346.16] No kidding.
[3346.18 → 3348.28] Especially because they're probably also going to want a Pro Controller.
[3348.82 → 3352.50] And those Pro Controllers, being USB-C-based, that's really expensive.
[3352.50 → 3356.00] They're, like, super dope, but not cheap.
[3356.10 → 3357.08] Not cheap at all.
[3357.08 → 3362.10] So, I could see it being a holiday purchase for a lot of different families.
[3362.36 → 3367.82] And if Mario Odyssey is good, that's two titles right there, which is often all it really needs to sell someone.
[3369.34 → 3372.04] Samsung SA is going to have facial recognition for payments.
[3373.20 → 3373.60] Cool.
[3374.18 → 3376.52] Let's do – we can do this as, like, one of our last articles.
[3376.90 → 3378.18] These two will do.
[3378.30 → 3379.14] I like both of these.
[3379.14 → 3383.94] So, first pictures of AMD Vega reference card has been released.
[3384.72 → 3387.10] And there's a new logo.
[3388.18 → 3390.20] There are a couple cool things here to notice.
[3390.56 → 3394.48] There's the Radeon Vega logo, which looks pretty sick in my opinion.
[3394.84 → 3398.40] And then that is, like, a cool stylized heat sink.
[3398.84 → 3401.74] You've got those, like, kind of slashes going on there.
[3402.20 → 3407.66] White backplate, which honestly is working with a lot of different system builds right now.
[3408.08 → 3411.10] There's a lot of white and black themed motherboards.
[3411.10 → 3411.40] White, red, and black.
[3411.68 → 3413.70] White, red, and black is definitely a thing.
[3415.44 → 3417.80] Like, I think that could look awesome.
[3418.80 → 3421.84] The side of it still looks like it will have the Radeon thing there.
[3421.84 → 3424.34] Is that, like, metal, do you think?
[3424.68 → 3425.84] I really can't tell.
[3425.92 → 3428.00] These seem like pretty not great photos.
[3428.02 → 3428.66] Yeah, no kidding.
[3429.58 → 3432.26] So, I'm going to try to not make very many assumptions about that.
[3432.44 → 3435.36] But I see where you're coming from on the metal thing.
[3435.42 → 3436.64] I was actually wondering that earlier.
[3436.96 → 3439.20] But it could just be, like, a really crappy –
[3439.20 → 3443.54] That kind of looks like a similar thing to the backplate that you changed.
[3445.14 → 3446.46] Yeah, like something could go there.
[3446.46 → 3447.94] Yeah, that's funny.
[3449.22 → 3451.14] But, yeah, no, I really like the look of the backplate.
[3451.14 → 3451.80] I think it looks great.
[3452.48 → 3457.26] It looks like it would be a V if it wasn't cut off there with the red logo.
[3457.40 → 3458.08] That looks really sharp.
[3458.32 → 3461.34] Radeon Vega, clean text, clean design.
[3461.54 → 3462.52] It's got the lines on there.
[3463.00 → 3463.88] Looks really sharp.
[3463.88 → 3465.42] It's really badass.
[3466.54 → 3470.90] I'm happy about that because, like, aesthetics are totally a thing right now.
[3471.00 → 3471.88] I ain't mad at that.
[3472.14 → 3473.10] I ain't mad at that.
[3473.80 → 3475.08] Jumping to another topic.
[3475.08 → 3481.18] Like, Sweden introduces programming from grade one, which is awesome in my opinion.
[3481.54 → 3485.10] I wish I had learned programming in grade one or in school at all.
[3485.66 → 3489.36] I wish it was, like, more of a thing at the schools that we were at.
[3489.48 → 3490.14] I would –
[3490.14 → 3491.66] Like, wasn't really that sort of thing.
[3491.66 → 3497.80] Instead of spending hours learning cursive, which I will never, ever, ever use.
[3498.12 → 3498.44] Yeah.
[3498.44 → 3502.56] I would love to be able to program something.
[3502.82 → 3503.04] Yeah.
[3503.16 → 3503.78] Like, anything.
[3504.42 → 3507.10] I'm, like, not capable.
[3507.84 → 3513.50] And the thing is, it's going to become, like, you might want to start taking Linda courses or something.
[3513.58 → 3515.44] Not to give our guys a shout-out.
[3515.44 → 3519.44] But because it's going to become –
[3519.44 → 3520.28] Oh, God.
[3520.50 → 3525.20] Yeah, the bot is targeting you now, so you only have to post it once, and then it reposts it, like, a billion times.
[3525.54 → 3527.14] I just spammed the chat.
[3527.34 → 3527.60] It's okay.
[3527.60 → 3528.72] Don't worry about it.
[3528.94 → 3529.24] It's okay.
[3529.72 → 3530.20] Don't worry about it.
[3530.20 → 3531.90] Gudrun just global bans you.
[3532.24 → 3533.22] Too much spamming.
[3533.22 → 3549.10] Anyway, like, it's going to be a very competitive thing in the job market because even business people, if you can make little bot things to help do stuff, if you can write really complex Excel equations, whatever, that will help you a lot.
[3549.10 → 3560.08] And speaking of really complex Excel equations, they want to integrate the fact that they're teaching people coding in schools into their math and science programs.
[3560.08 → 3565.86] So in order to solve certain problems, you're going to be able to write a program to do it for you.
[3565.94 → 3574.32] And they're going to want you to try to figure out how to write programs to solve different arithmetic problems automatically instead of you doing it.
[3574.38 → 3576.32] And they're going to want you to be able to do it on your own.
[3576.68 → 3576.90] Yeah.
[3577.24 → 3584.38] Because they're going to go, like, okay, now that you understand this concept, kind of show me how you understand it by making this computer solve it for you.
[3584.48 → 3586.42] And then you've now ascended beyond that.
[3586.52 → 3588.06] You don't have to worry about doing it manually anymore.
[3588.16 → 3589.30] You can just have this computer do it.
[3589.30 → 3590.86] I think that's super cool.
[3590.88 → 3591.26] That would be awesome.
[3591.46 → 3591.72] Yeah.
[3592.70 → 3593.54] That would be awesome.
[3593.64 → 3597.22] Instead of, okay, it's time for your grade 12 provincials.
[3597.76 → 3600.68] Everybody clear the data on your graphing calculator.
[3600.68 → 3601.24] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3601.24 → 3605.40] You can't have any games or cheat codes on your graphing calculators.
[3605.86 → 3607.70] Otherwise, you're going to get expelled.
[3609.30 → 3610.36] We can't have it.
[3610.64 → 3612.66] That was so annoying because I actually had a lot of stuff in there.
[3612.66 → 3616.06] The dumbest, like, school, man.
[3616.06 → 3619.38] Sorry, I brought tools that made me prepared for this issue.
[3619.52 → 3620.20] My bad.
[3620.58 → 3624.36] Anyway, a note from Sweden's Minister of Education says,
[3624.48 → 3628.88] We need more coders, and it's a skill that will be needed in more jobs in the future.
[3629.02 → 3635.76] Moreover, we are being affected by coding to a growing degree.
[3635.76 → 3637.96] To a greater degree.
[3638.42 → 3638.78] Probably.
[3638.94 → 3639.56] That makes sense.
[3639.88 → 3641.06] To an increasing degree.
[3641.44 → 3641.64] Yeah.
[3641.82 → 3641.98] Yeah.
[3642.12 → 3643.68] I think that is super cool.
[3643.88 → 3646.06] I think teaching coding in school is super important.
[3646.18 → 3649.06] I think that should be, like, a basic skill that basically everyone has.
[3649.14 → 3649.36] Yeah.
[3649.70 → 3650.82] I wish I had some of it.
[3651.32 → 3652.94] Because I'm going to be that old man who's like,
[3652.98 → 3655.28] I don't get these kids these days.
[3655.38 → 3656.44] They have the code.
[3657.08 → 3659.24] They have all the stuff, the technology.
[3659.44 → 3660.34] It's ridiculous.
[3660.34 → 3663.54] I even took some of the stuff in school, and I'm going to be that old man.
[3663.62 → 3665.14] So I need to take refresher courses.
[3665.20 → 3666.50] Isn't it weird feeling old?
[3666.60 → 3667.08] It is.
[3668.08 → 3671.32] Three printing and coding is going to be taught in school.
[3671.32 → 3671.68] I tell you.
[3672.14 → 3673.38] I tell you what.
[3673.58 → 3674.34] That's going to be fascinating.
[3675.74 → 3677.88] Anyway, guys, I think that's it for the stream.
[3679.76 → 3680.84] Thanks for coming by.
[3680.94 → 3685.44] Thank you for watching Sick and Tired host the WAN show for you this week.
[3685.44 → 3689.94] If you want to tune in next week, twitch.tv slash Linus Tech.
[3690.60 → 3691.50] It's pretty cool.
[3691.98 → 3692.96] Same bat channel.
[3694.22 → 3698.22] A not this coming Friday, but the one after that,
[3698.28 → 3700.18] are we going to be able to have a WAN show?
[3701.86 → 3703.04] I have to be cryptic.
[3703.14 → 3703.84] I think so.
[3704.50 → 3708.20] And not today, but next Friday,
[3708.72 → 3710.92] I think there's going to be some guests on the show.
[3711.20 → 3711.54] Oh.
[3712.02 → 3714.10] And I think there's going to be a special announcement.
[3714.62 → 3714.82] Oh.
[3714.82 → 3716.84] Bye.
[3717.22 → 3717.58] Bye.
[3719.52 → 3720.52] Wait, I have to roll it.
[3721.72 → 3722.46] Oh, God.
[3723.58 → 3724.30] Okay, we're good.
[3728.38 → 3728.76] Hey, cool.
[3730.10 → 3730.56] Hey there.
[3731.78 → 3732.50] How are you doing?
[3734.50 → 3735.18] We're doing the way.
[3735.32 → 3736.34] We're finishing up the show.
[3736.50 → 3737.04] I'm running the up.
[3737.52 → 3738.56] I'm trying to say hi.
[3738.78 → 3739.86] It's also just the intro.
[3741.46 → 3742.44] The intro is the outro?
[3742.74 → 3742.94] Yeah.
[3743.18 → 3743.84] That's pretty crazy.
[3743.96 → 3744.34] It's Christmas.
[3745.26 → 3745.58] Christmas.
[3746.04 → 3746.88] Fresh books.
[3747.68 → 3748.18] Oh, never mind.
[3748.50 → 3749.06] Fresh books.
[3749.52 → 3750.48] Uh, software.
[3750.66 → 3751.28] Logan's Colton.
[3751.36 → 3751.96] Hey, guys.
[3752.02 → 3752.76] What's going on?
[3753.22 → 3753.78] Hey, all right.
[3753.84 → 3755.10] Let's, uh, talk about today.
[3755.22 → 3755.46] Okay.
[3755.88 → 3756.08] Bye.
[3756.76 → 3756.90] Bye.
[3756.90 → 3757.00] Bye.
[3757.00 → 3757.10] Bye.
[3757.10 → 3757.26] Bye.
[3759.26 → 3759.70] Bye.
[3759.70 → 3759.96] Bye.
[3769.96 → 3771.94] Bye.
