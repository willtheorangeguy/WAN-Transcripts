[0.00 --> 4.00]  All right.
[10.00 --> 11.00]  Switch.
[13.00 --> 16.00]  Oh, I didn't check if the intro was working.
[16.00 --> 18.00]  I had hoped to fix that this week, but...
[18.00 --> 21.00]  Well, I'm pretty sure the file hasn't changed, so...
[21.00 --> 22.00]  So...
[23.00 --> 24.00]  No.
[25.00 --> 27.00]  Actually, wait, no snap, because nothing's...
[27.00 --> 32.00]  There you go, there you go.
[32.00 --> 35.00]  All right, so we've got a great show for you guys today.
[35.00 --> 39.00]  Colton prepared the doc in what appears to be about 17 minutes.
[39.00 --> 43.00]  There's not a lot of detail in it, but we love him anyway.
[43.00 --> 49.00]  The Nintendo Switch debuts March the 3rd at 299...
[49.00 --> 53.00]  Oh, oh, oh, terrible, terrible, terrible turn off. Thank you.
[53.00 --> 55.00]  And that's where the snap thing came from.
[55.00 --> 59.00]  If you didn't watch the Nintendo Switch keynote, whenever they change topics, they would go...
[59.00 --> 61.00]  Yeah, which is super charming.
[61.00 --> 62.00]  Yeah.
[62.00 --> 64.00]  So the Nintendo Switch is coming.
[64.00 --> 69.00]  The Nokia 6, Nokia's first Android smartphone, is official.
[69.00 --> 72.00]  Nokia is joining the likes of Caterpillar.
[72.00 --> 75.00]  Now, everybody has an Android phone.
[75.00 --> 76.00]  Yeah.
[76.00 --> 77.00]  Where's your Android phone?
[77.00 --> 78.00]  We... I mean...
[78.00 --> 80.00]  The Luke Droid. No, that is not yours.
[80.00 --> 81.00]  I mean...
[81.00 --> 82.00]  That is Google's.
[82.00 --> 83.00]  But it is... No.
[83.00 --> 84.00]  No. No.
[84.00 --> 85.00]  And you didn't.
[86.00 --> 87.00]  Also fair.
[87.00 --> 88.00]  Okay, moving on.
[88.00 --> 89.00]  HDMI 2...
[89.00 --> 90.00]  Forgot about that part.
[91.00 --> 94.00]  HDMI 2.1 announced at CES. What do you got?
[94.00 --> 96.00]  Linus might have stolen...
[96.00 --> 97.00]  I did not.
[97.00 --> 98.00]  ...Project Valerie.
[98.00 --> 100.00]  Bull... Bull crap. Roll the intro.
[100.00 --> 101.00]  I'm gonna do a search.
[101.00 --> 105.00]  No, you will not.
[105.00 --> 106.00]  All lies.
[106.00 --> 107.00]  All lies.
[107.00 --> 109.00]  That is not what happened.
[109.00 --> 110.00]  Not...
[110.00 --> 112.00]  I'm going to deny it forever.
[112.00 --> 114.00]  I'm gonna be like...
[114.00 --> 121.00]  Who just denies everything in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary?
[121.00 --> 123.00]  Can you think of anyone like that?
[123.00 --> 124.00]  Uh...
[124.00 --> 125.00]  I can't either.
[125.00 --> 126.00]  No.
[126.00 --> 127.00]  Yeah.
[127.00 --> 128.00]  Not me neither.
[128.00 --> 129.00]  Not a single person.
[129.00 --> 130.00]  I can't think of anybody like that.
[130.00 --> 131.00]  No.
[131.00 --> 132.00]  What's the date today?
[132.00 --> 133.00]  What are we a week away from?
[133.00 --> 134.00]  Uh...
[134.00 --> 135.00]  Packs?
[135.00 --> 136.00]  Friday the 13th is today.
[136.00 --> 137.00]  Not quite.
[137.00 --> 138.00]  Yeah.
[138.00 --> 139.00]  Lucky, right?
[139.00 --> 140.00]  Okay.
[140.00 --> 141.00]  Moving on.
[141.00 --> 142.00]  Nintendo Switch?
[142.00 --> 143.00]  Should we just jump right into that?
[143.00 --> 144.00]  Let's just jump right into it.
[144.00 --> 145.00]  Okay, let me bring it.
[145.00 --> 146.00]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[146.00 --> 147.00]  You can't jump into it yet.
[147.00 --> 148.00]  You gotta like...
[148.00 --> 150.00]  Right into the Switch.
[150.00 --> 152.00]  You gotta at least put your bathing suit on, you know?
[152.00 --> 153.00]  Whoa.
[153.00 --> 155.00]  Nintendo announces the Switch.
[155.00 --> 156.00]  I mean, you don't have to.
[156.00 --> 157.00]  I don't have to.
[157.00 --> 158.00]  Jesus.
[158.00 --> 164.00]  Nintendo announces Switch specs in an event that we weren't invited to.
[164.00 --> 165.00]  No.
[165.00 --> 166.00]  Not that we're salty.
[166.00 --> 167.00]  So, go ahead and talk about...
[167.00 --> 168.00]  I'm pretty salty.
[168.00 --> 169.00]  Talk about how we're not salty.
[169.00 --> 172.00]  I poured an entire can of salt while watching this.
[172.00 --> 175.00]  Uh, so, it's coming March 3rd.
[175.00 --> 181.00]  It will retail for $299 US dollars, which doesn't sound that cheap, but is, I believe,
[181.00 --> 185.00]  the 3rd cheapest console launch ever when adjusted for inflation.
[185.00 --> 186.00]  Yeah.
[186.00 --> 187.00]  I remember looking that up.
[187.00 --> 189.00]  Like, how much a Super Nintendo costs in today dollars.
[189.00 --> 190.00]  It's like a lot.
[190.00 --> 191.00]  It's like...
[191.00 --> 194.00]  Like, Neo Geo or something was like $1,000.
[194.00 --> 196.00]  Like, how much metal's in this thing?
[196.00 --> 197.00]  Yeah.
[197.00 --> 198.00]  You know?
[198.00 --> 199.00]  Like, oh my goodness.
[199.00 --> 203.00]  Anyways, the controllers on the left and right are now...
[203.00 --> 206.00]  Well, I think they're officially called Joy-Con controllers.
[206.00 --> 207.00]  Joy-Con?
[207.00 --> 208.00]  They are.
[208.00 --> 210.00]  Wow, Joy-Con sounds like something else entirely.
[210.00 --> 211.00]  They are.
[211.00 --> 214.00]  I didn't watch the event, so this is all coming to me fresh here.
[214.00 --> 216.00]  I mean, it's like coming right at me.
[216.00 --> 217.00]  It's hitting me right in the face.
[217.00 --> 218.00]  I want to attend Joy-Con.
[218.00 --> 220.00]  Guess it's hitting you right in the face at Joy-Con?
[220.00 --> 222.00]  Right in the face at Joy-Con, man.
[223.00 --> 224.00]  Guess how much they cost.
[224.00 --> 228.00]  I mean, I missed AVN this year because they no longer run it during the same...
[228.00 --> 229.00]  at the same time as CES, right?
[229.00 --> 231.00]  Hasn't it not been at the same time for like a long time?
[231.00 --> 232.00]  Yeah, it's been a few years.
[232.00 --> 239.00]  It's been a few years, but it used to be that it was like two like long, hard conventions
[239.00 --> 243.00]  were in the same city of sin at the same time and...
[243.00 --> 245.00]  On like very polar opposite ends of the spectrum.
[245.00 --> 246.00]  Yeah, I know.
[246.00 --> 253.00]  It's like people who literally get paid to have sex and people who have to pay.
[253.00 --> 254.00]  I mean, I...
[254.00 --> 259.00]  I mean, there's a lot of cool people at CES too.
[259.00 --> 260.00]  Yeah.
[260.00 --> 261.00]  Anyways...
[261.00 --> 262.00]  We were there.
[262.00 --> 263.00]  Thank you.
[263.00 --> 265.00]  I appreciate it.
[265.00 --> 268.00]  Guess how much the Joy-Con controllers cost.
[268.00 --> 269.00]  Wait, I thought...
[269.00 --> 270.00]  I assumed they would be included.
[270.00 --> 271.00]  They are.
[271.00 --> 272.00]  Okay.
[272.00 --> 273.00]  But if you want...
[273.00 --> 274.00]  Why would you want more?
[274.00 --> 282.00]  Oh, like if you want to use a Derp Square controller and you don't just buy a Wii pro controller for some reason.
[282.00 --> 283.00]  Yeah, I know.
[283.00 --> 286.00]  Some people have been saying that apparently they feel good.
[286.00 --> 287.00]  I seriously doubt that's going to be true.
[287.00 --> 288.00]  Okay, hold on.
[288.00 --> 289.00]  What was it?
[289.00 --> 290.00]  Jimmy Kimmel who unveiled the Switch for the first time?
[290.00 --> 291.00]  That sounds right.
[291.00 --> 293.00]  I think it was Jimmy Kimmel.
[293.00 --> 295.00]  So, did you hear it from him?
[295.00 --> 296.00]  No.
[296.00 --> 297.00]  Okay.
[297.00 --> 300.00]  Because I was going to say, he's a giant Nintendo fanboy.
[300.00 --> 301.00]  Oh.
[301.00 --> 303.00]  Did you hear it from a giant Nintendo fanboy?
[303.00 --> 304.00]  Maybe.
[304.00 --> 305.00]  Because it looks abominable.
[305.00 --> 306.00]  It does.
[306.00 --> 307.00]  No, I know.
[307.00 --> 309.00]  The first time I saw it, I was like, wow, that's horrible.
[309.00 --> 312.00]  But okay, to be fair, it looks really good when it's on the side of the Switch.
[312.00 --> 314.00]  The Wii U controller with the screen in the middle?
[314.00 --> 315.00]  Okay.
[315.00 --> 316.00]  I actually love that one.
[316.00 --> 317.00]  Okay.
[317.00 --> 318.00]  But it's one of those...
[318.00 --> 320.00]  But when it's on that like box?
[320.00 --> 321.00]  It is weird.
[321.00 --> 322.00]  I don't like that.
[322.00 --> 325.00]  So, I think it's kind of a shoulder width question.
[325.00 --> 327.00]  Oh, that could be it.
[327.00 --> 329.00]  Because this is comfortable.
[329.00 --> 330.00]  Yeah.
[330.00 --> 331.00]  And this is just not.
[331.00 --> 333.00]  No matter how ergonomic the thing you're holding is.
[333.00 --> 338.00]  It's like the whole 10 keyless versus 104 key layout for FPS games argument.
[338.00 --> 342.00]  You want that natural shoulder width.
[342.00 --> 343.00]  Yeah, because I really...
[343.00 --> 346.00]  Like my favorite controller for the Wii U is the main one.
[346.00 --> 350.00]  With that said, let's get in a console gamer posture here.
[350.00 --> 351.00]  Okay.
[351.00 --> 352.00]  Because right now we're sitting at a desk.
[352.00 --> 353.00]  Alright.
[353.00 --> 354.00]  So hold on.
[354.00 --> 355.00]  Alright.
[355.00 --> 356.00]  Okay, I'm assuming the position here.
[356.00 --> 357.00]  Alright.
[357.00 --> 358.00]  Yeah, no, that's good.
[358.00 --> 360.00]  You know what?
[360.00 --> 363.00]  I'm actually liking it a lot more now.
[363.00 --> 364.00]  See, because if you use the pillow...
[364.00 --> 365.00]  Yeah.
[365.00 --> 366.00]  Use the pillow.
[366.00 --> 367.00]  Okay.
[367.00 --> 368.00]  See, that's kind of alright.
[368.00 --> 369.00]  That's alright.
[369.00 --> 371.00]  But let's flip the pillow the other way.
[371.00 --> 373.00]  That's kind of alright too.
[373.00 --> 379.00]  Like if I've got the controller in the lap, which 90% of the time for me, if I'm using
[379.00 --> 382.00]  a controller, it's the one in my lap.
[382.00 --> 383.00]  Yeah.
[383.00 --> 384.00]  So maybe...
[384.00 --> 385.00]  Maybe we're just not...
[385.00 --> 386.00]  We'll have to try it out.
[386.00 --> 387.00]  Yeah.
[387.00 --> 388.00]  We'll have to try it out.
[388.00 --> 390.00]  Maybe we're not giving it a fair shake.
[390.00 --> 391.00]  Okay.
[391.00 --> 392.00]  Hit me with some more deets.
[392.00 --> 393.00]  Joy-con.
[393.00 --> 394.00]  You have to guess how much they are.
[394.00 --> 395.00]  Oh, I have to guess how much they are.
[395.00 --> 396.00]  If you want to buy extras.
[396.00 --> 401.00]  I mean, if they're anything other than $59.99, I'll be surprised.
[401.00 --> 406.00]  Because there's certain games that you need two full sets of those.
[406.00 --> 408.00]  Because those are the motion controllers.
[408.00 --> 409.00]  Oh, I see.
[409.00 --> 410.00]  Those have motion in them.
[410.00 --> 411.00]  Yeah.
[411.00 --> 412.00]  So you'll have to buy another one.
[412.00 --> 416.00]  And they have like HD vibrator things, which apparently you can like feel...
[416.00 --> 417.00]  Like if someone...
[417.00 --> 421.00]  If you're holding like a glass with this thing, you can like feel someone pouring water in.
[421.00 --> 423.00]  We're gonna have to try it.
[423.00 --> 424.00]  We're gonna have to try it.
[424.00 --> 425.00]  Okay.
[425.00 --> 426.00]  Alright.
[426.00 --> 430.00]  There's gonna be like one stupid like quest in Zelda.
[430.00 --> 431.00]  Yep.
[431.00 --> 436.00]  Where you have to like fill water jugs or some crap.
[436.00 --> 443.00]  And it'll be like this completely contrived like yell at your DS style thing.
[443.00 --> 445.00]  Do you remember that?
[445.00 --> 449.00]  I have to blow the feather thing.
[449.00 --> 451.00]  That was so stupid.
[451.00 --> 452.00]  They wanted to...
[452.00 --> 453.00]  Okay.
[453.00 --> 456.00]  For the DS, they wanted to show off how like the microphone could be integrated into games.
[456.00 --> 460.00]  So on some weird mini game, you have to like blow on the DS.
[460.00 --> 461.00]  So you'd see people like...
[461.00 --> 464.00]  It was so dumb.
[464.00 --> 466.00]  Anyways, 80 US dollars.
[466.00 --> 468.00]  80 US dollars?
[468.00 --> 469.00]  Yeah.
[469.00 --> 472.00]  So $300 for a controller and then to equip...
[472.00 --> 473.00]  $300 for a console with a controller.
[473.00 --> 474.00]  Yeah, with a controller.
[474.00 --> 475.00]  Yeah, with a controller.
[475.00 --> 481.00]  And then another $240 to equip all of your friends...
[481.00 --> 482.00]  US dollars.
[482.00 --> 483.00]  With controllers.
[483.00 --> 484.00]  US dollars.
[484.00 --> 490.00]  To be fair, each Joy-Con controller, if you're playing a game that doesn't require like the motion in each hand,
[490.00 --> 493.00]  can be split out and turned into two controllers sideways.
[493.00 --> 494.00]  Yeah, but that...
[494.00 --> 496.00]  I mean, if we're talking ergonomics, that's...
[496.00 --> 497.00]  It looks horrible.
[497.00 --> 498.00]  No.
[498.00 --> 500.00]  It actually looks like the worst thing.
[500.00 --> 501.00]  Yeah, no.
[501.00 --> 503.00]  Because like Wiimotes turned sideways are doable.
[503.00 --> 505.00]  Yeah, they're somewhat usable.
[505.00 --> 506.00]  They're all right.
[506.00 --> 509.00]  But they're a lot wider than the Joy-Con.
[509.00 --> 510.00]  The Joy-Con controllers are way smaller.
[510.00 --> 512.00]  This feels terrible to me.
[512.00 --> 514.00]  That reminds me of that...
[514.00 --> 517.00]  What was that SteelSeries Bluetooth controller that they...
[517.00 --> 518.00]  It's 70, not 80, apparently.
[518.00 --> 523.00]  That they discontinued almost immediately after they launched it.
[523.00 --> 525.00]  I don't remember what it was called, but it was awful.
[525.00 --> 529.00]  It was like a mobile game controller.
[529.00 --> 530.00]  $70.
[530.00 --> 531.00]  I was wrong.
[531.00 --> 532.00]  $70.
[532.00 --> 533.00]  Okay.
[533.00 --> 534.00]  So it's $69.99.
[534.00 --> 535.00]  Yeah.
[535.00 --> 537.00]  Which is still $10 higher than I guessed.
[537.00 --> 538.00]  $20.
[538.00 --> 540.00]  You said if they're over 50 bucks.
[540.00 --> 541.00]  I said $59.99.
[541.00 --> 542.00]  Ah.
[542.00 --> 544.00]  Because I think that's what everyone else is at, if I recall correctly.
[544.00 --> 545.00]  That's very common.
[545.00 --> 546.00]  Yeah.
[546.00 --> 548.00]  I still don't like it.
[548.00 --> 550.00]  And it's $70 for a Pro controller.
[550.00 --> 551.00]  And it's $70.
[551.00 --> 552.00]  I...
[552.00 --> 554.00]  Yeah, but the Pro controller isn't going to have the two...
[554.00 --> 555.00]  Yeah.
[555.00 --> 556.00]  Isn't going to have all the motion stuff.
[556.00 --> 562.00]  And when I'm filling my jug, I won't know how full my jug is.
[562.00 --> 563.00]  Except for visually.
[563.00 --> 564.00]  Yeah.
[564.00 --> 565.00]  Right.
[565.00 --> 567.00]  Which is where I would be looking.
[567.00 --> 569.00]  And my attention would be focused.
[569.00 --> 570.00]  Presumably.
[570.00 --> 572.00]  Someone said WTF is a Pro controller.
[572.00 --> 576.00]  That's like your more standard gaming controller deal.
[576.00 --> 577.00]  For the Wii U.
[577.00 --> 578.00]  Yeah.
[578.00 --> 579.00]  And there's new ones.
[579.00 --> 580.00]  And they look cool.
[580.00 --> 581.00]  They have some see-through stuff going on.
[581.00 --> 582.00]  Okay.
[582.00 --> 583.00]  So we're back to N64.
[585.00 --> 586.00]  That's back in fashion.
[586.00 --> 589.00]  Is Apple going to redo their whole aluminum aesthetic?
[589.00 --> 592.00]  And they're going to bring back the colorful iMac?
[592.00 --> 593.00]  Hopefully.
[593.00 --> 594.00]  Hopefully.
[594.00 --> 596.00]  I've always loved see-through electronics.
[596.00 --> 597.00]  Imagine a...
[597.00 --> 598.00]  Okay.
[598.00 --> 599.00]  Hold up.
[599.00 --> 600.00]  Hold up.
[600.00 --> 603.00]  Imagine like a glass razor blade.
[603.00 --> 604.00]  Yeah.
[604.00 --> 605.00]  I'm down.
[605.00 --> 606.00]  100% down.
[606.00 --> 607.00]  Yeah.
[607.00 --> 608.00]  Yeah.
[608.00 --> 609.00]  If it could like stand up in durability-wise.
[609.00 --> 614.00]  When someone figures out how to economically machine and polish glass.
[614.00 --> 615.00]  Yeah.
[615.00 --> 616.00]  It will come.
[616.00 --> 617.00]  Like sick.
[617.00 --> 618.00]  It will come.
[618.00 --> 619.00]  Like really clean.
[619.00 --> 620.00]  Yeah.
[620.00 --> 621.00]  Very clean.
[621.00 --> 622.00]  Because the modern deal is clean.
[622.00 --> 624.00]  Not like purple plastic that you can see through.
[624.00 --> 625.00]  Well that and they'll use it anyway.
[625.00 --> 626.00]  Even if...
[626.00 --> 628.00]  Like they'll use it even if they make it opaque.
[628.00 --> 629.00]  Like they could do black glass.
[629.00 --> 630.00]  Yeah.
[630.00 --> 631.00]  And it would be a fingerprint magnet.
[631.00 --> 633.00]  But at least you could clean it.
[633.00 --> 634.00]  That's see...
[634.00 --> 635.00]  That's my...
[635.00 --> 637.00]  I get product managers asking me this all the time.
[637.00 --> 639.00]  Why don't you like glossy black?
[639.00 --> 641.00]  And I'm like because it's plastic.
[641.00 --> 642.00]  It scratches immediately.
[642.00 --> 643.00]  It's going to scratch and look terrible.
[643.00 --> 644.00]  Yeah.
[644.00 --> 645.00]  It looks like garbage.
[645.00 --> 650.00]  People call me out like oh you hate glossy plastic but you're cool with tempered glass.
[650.00 --> 654.00]  And I'm like yeah but you can take like a microfiber cloth.
[654.00 --> 655.00]  Yeah.
[655.00 --> 656.00]  And like whip it a couple times.
[656.00 --> 657.00]  Exactly.
[657.00 --> 658.00]  And all the dust will float off and then you're fine.
[658.00 --> 659.00]  And the...
[659.00 --> 660.00]  Because half of the issue is static.
[660.00 --> 661.00]  Yeah.
[661.00 --> 664.66]  It's impossible to clean a piece of acrylic because the second you wipe it you generate
[664.66 --> 669.72]  a static charge and it grabs all the dust within a five foot radius and like sticks
[669.72 --> 670.72]  it there.
[670.72 --> 672.72]  That's why we don't like it.
[672.72 --> 673.72]  Oh.
[673.72 --> 675.72]  Alright what else you got for me?
[675.72 --> 676.72]  Anyways.
[676.72 --> 680.72]  The Breath of the Wild is launching the exact same day the console is.
[680.72 --> 682.72]  Which is surprising to anybody because...
[682.72 --> 684.72]  Because they've been like moving it constantly.
[684.72 --> 686.72]  Is there even another game yet?
[686.72 --> 691.72]  It's also a little surprise to everybody because there are not a ton of other smash hits coming
[691.72 --> 692.72]  with the console.
[692.72 --> 693.72]  Smash hits?
[693.72 --> 695.72]  Ah there's no smash coming with the console.
[695.72 --> 699.72]  Mario Kart is called I think Mario Kart 8 Deluxe or something like that.
[699.72 --> 701.72]  So I believe it's the same game.
[701.72 --> 704.72]  But you can't put a disc into the Switch.
[704.72 --> 707.72]  So you're going to have to buy it digitally.
[707.72 --> 708.72]  Probably brand new.
[708.72 --> 710.72]  Probably full price.
[710.72 --> 712.72]  That's my guess.
[712.72 --> 715.72]  Or like a little bit off but probably not that much.
[715.72 --> 718.72]  Because tons of people are going to want to play Mario Kart.
[718.72 --> 719.72]  Play Mario Kart with your friends.
[719.72 --> 720.72]  Switch is mobile.
[720.72 --> 721.72]  Right?
[721.72 --> 722.72]  Yeah.
[722.72 --> 723.72]  You can play Skyrim.
[723.72 --> 724.72]  You saw that right?
[724.72 --> 725.72]  Yeah.
[725.72 --> 726.72]  Have you seen the new Mario game?
[726.72 --> 727.72]  No I have not.
[727.72 --> 728.72]  I've been living under a rock.
[728.72 --> 730.72]  It looks super weird.
[730.72 --> 732.72]  You can like parkour in New York.
[732.72 --> 734.72]  Literally not kidding.
[734.72 --> 736.72]  And it's not coming out until like winter.
[736.72 --> 737.72]  Okay.
[737.72 --> 738.72]  Okay.
[738.72 --> 741.72]  Polygon's list of launch titles or launch window titles.
[741.72 --> 742.72]  Here perfect.
[742.72 --> 743.72]  Okay.
[743.72 --> 749.72]  So launch day is 1-2 Switch which is like this basically controller demo style Nintendo game.
[749.72 --> 750.72]  You know how they always have those?
[750.72 --> 751.72]  Okay.
[751.72 --> 752.72]  You know what?
[752.72 --> 753.72]  Those are often very fun.
[753.72 --> 754.72]  Wii Sports?
[754.72 --> 755.72]  Was very good.
[755.72 --> 756.72]  Okay.
[756.72 --> 757.72]  Let me.
[757.72 --> 758.72]  I'm going to say something and it's going to make you cry.
[758.72 --> 759.72]  What?
[759.72 --> 761.72]  It might even make you die a little bit inside.
[761.72 --> 762.72]  Okay.
[762.72 --> 763.72]  Okay.
[763.72 --> 764.72]  So you know my gaming setup in my living room right?
[764.72 --> 765.72]  Yes.
[765.72 --> 766.72]  Where I have the GTX.
[766.72 --> 769.72]  I think it's like a 980 Ti equipped PC.
[769.72 --> 772.72]  I've got the 65 inch TV.
[772.72 --> 776.72]  I've got the Vive VR headset.
[776.72 --> 781.72]  Everything's set up to be simple enough that like my son can turn it on and switch between
[781.72 --> 783.72]  all the different stuff that he wants to play.
[783.72 --> 784.72]  Okay.
[784.72 --> 792.72]  So in the last month he has spent about 10 times more time on the Nintendo Wii.
[792.72 --> 793.72]  Playing Wii Sports?
[793.72 --> 794.72]  Playing Wii Sports.
[794.72 --> 795.72]  That doesn't make me die inside.
[795.72 --> 796.72]  Than he has in VR.
[796.72 --> 798.72]  No I actually totally get it.
[798.72 --> 799.72]  I get it.
[799.72 --> 803.72]  Like for him where both of these experiences are equally new.
[803.72 --> 808.72]  Motion control is actually the more engaging of the two.
[808.72 --> 810.72]  Well there's motion control.
[810.72 --> 811.72]  Yes.
[811.72 --> 813.72]  But pure motion control looking at the TV.
[813.72 --> 816.72]  And there isn't a game that's as good as Wii Sports.
[816.72 --> 818.72]  On the Vive.
[818.72 --> 820.72]  Get wrecked but it's true.
[820.72 --> 824.72]  If Audio Shield's algorithm wasn't garbage it would be really fun.
[824.72 --> 829.72]  But a lot of the time you're just like, yeah this music is like so awesome I'm pumped.
[829.72 --> 830.72]  Bing.
[830.72 --> 831.72]  Yeah yeah here we go.
[831.72 --> 834.72]  And it's totally out of beat and everything's sort of weird.
[834.72 --> 835.72]  Yeah.
[835.72 --> 839.72]  Like if I was actually, like if they actually DDR styled it.
[839.72 --> 846.72]  Like professionally guitar heroed it to the point where everything was perfectly in tune.
[846.72 --> 847.72]  Awesome.
[847.72 --> 848.72]  Yeah.
[848.72 --> 850.72]  And it's like, I can't really just sit and play Audio Shield for like hours.
[850.72 --> 851.72]  Yeah.
[851.72 --> 852.72]  Because even now I put up with a lot of this crap.
[852.72 --> 856.72]  I've basically only found one game that I, or one song that I really like playing on it.
[856.72 --> 858.72]  And it's a remix of the Imperial March.
[858.72 --> 861.72]  And it actually like goes pretty well.
[861.72 --> 865.72]  But it's not like ridiculously like fast paced.
[865.72 --> 866.72]  Yeah.
[866.72 --> 868.72]  Like I want to do this a whole bunch so I can remember how I have to move kind of deal.
[868.72 --> 869.72]  Right.
[869.72 --> 870.72]  Yeah.
[870.72 --> 872.72]  It feels cool to just be like bah bah bah.
[872.72 --> 873.72]  Right.
[873.72 --> 875.72]  Which will work a lot better with their algorithm.
[875.72 --> 877.72]  Because it's slow, big notes.
[877.72 --> 878.72]  Yeah.
[878.72 --> 881.72]  Anyways, so 1-2 Switch which is actually probably going to be pretty damn cool.
[881.72 --> 885.72]  Because those Nintendo launch weird demo game things are actually very fun.
[885.72 --> 888.72]  Legend of Zelda which is going to sell this console.
[888.72 --> 889.72]  Yeah.
[889.72 --> 890.72]  100%.
[890.72 --> 891.72]  Yeah.
[891.72 --> 894.72]  Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild is super sick looking and it's totally going to sell the console.
[894.72 --> 898.72]  Skylanders Imaginators and Just Dance 2017.
[898.72 --> 900.72]  That's the launch lineup.
[900.72 --> 901.72]  Four games.
[901.72 --> 902.72]  One-two Switch.
[902.72 --> 903.72]  That's the Switch.
[903.72 --> 904.72]  That's something new.
[904.72 --> 905.72]  Okay.
[905.72 --> 906.72]  One-two Switch is going to be very cool.
[906.72 --> 907.72]  Okay.
[907.72 --> 908.72]  Has-been Heroes, March 2017.
[908.72 --> 909.72]  Okay.
[909.72 --> 910.72]  March 2017 is like a bajillion things.
[910.72 --> 911.72]  There's one, two, three, four.
[911.72 --> 912.72]  Okay.
[912.72 --> 913.72]  What do we got?
[913.72 --> 914.72]  Has-been Heroes, Sonic Mania.
[914.72 --> 919.72]  It's a Sonic game that does not count.
[919.72 --> 924.72]  I am sitting here with the game.
[924.72 --> 925.72]  That's the game.
[925.72 --> 926.72]  That's the game.
[926.72 --> 927.72]  It's the game.
[927.72 --> 928.72]  Yeah.
[928.72 --> 929.72]  I'm sitting here with the game.
[929.72 --> 930.72]  The game is a game.
[930.72 --> 931.72]  I am Sitsuna.
[931.72 --> 932.72]  No idea.
[932.72 --> 935.72]  Lego City Undercover, whatever that is in the spring.
[935.72 --> 936.72]  Arms-
[936.72 --> 937.72]  Arms is a little rough.
[937.72 --> 940.72]  Super Bomberman R, Snipperclips, cut it out together.
[940.72 --> 941.72]  Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is literally just Mario Kart 8.
[941.72 --> 944.72]  Is Snipperclips literally like a haircutting simulator?
[944.72 --> 945.72]  Like what-
[945.72 --> 946.72]  Snipperclips.
[946.72 --> 948.72]  Even Mario Kart 8 Deluxe isn't coming till April.
[948.72 --> 949.72]  How hard is it to release-
[949.72 --> 950.72]  That should have been-
[950.72 --> 951.72]  What?
[951.72 --> 952.72]  Sniperclips.
[952.72 --> 953.72]  Ooh.
[953.72 --> 954.72]  Ooh, yeah.
[954.72 --> 955.72]  No.
[955.72 --> 956.72]  Snipperclips out it together.
[956.72 --> 957.72]  Okay.
[957.72 --> 958.72]  Well, what is this?
[958.72 --> 959.72]  Wow.
[959.72 --> 960.72]  There's like nothing.
[960.72 --> 961.72]  I can't find it.
[961.72 --> 962.72]  Oh, no.
[962.72 --> 963.72]  Here, here, here.
[963.72 --> 964.72]  Search instead.
[964.72 --> 965.72]  Search instead.
[965.72 --> 966.72]  Snipperclips.
[966.72 --> 967.72]  Down, down, down.
[967.72 --> 968.72]  There.
[968.72 --> 969.72]  Yeah.
[969.72 --> 970.72]  That one.
[970.72 --> 971.72]  Yeah.
[971.72 --> 972.72]  Nothing.
[972.72 --> 973.72]  Great clips.
[973.72 --> 975.72]  I mean, apparently, comes up before-
[975.72 --> 976.72]  Oh, it's one word.
[976.72 --> 977.72]  Before Snipperclips.
[977.72 --> 979.72]  If we try to-
[979.72 --> 980.72]  Snipperclips.
[980.72 --> 981.72]  $20.
[981.72 --> 982.72]  Cut it out together.
[982.72 --> 983.72]  It's-
[983.72 --> 984.72]  It's paper.
[984.72 --> 985.72]  Okay, it's paper.
[986.72 --> 988.72]  Um, is it Puzzle Model?
[988.72 --> 989.72]  What are they doing?
[989.72 --> 990.72]  Or like, I don't know.
[990.72 --> 991.72]  Here.
[991.72 --> 992.72]  Can you share my screen?
[992.72 --> 993.72]  Yeah, I can't, but I'll-
[993.72 --> 994.72]  I'm gonna bring this up.
[994.72 --> 999.72]  If anyone else is curious what Snipperclips is, um, which-
[999.72 --> 1000.72]  Which site are you on?
[1000.72 --> 1001.72]  Nintendo.
[1001.72 --> 1002.72]  Nintendo.
[1002.72 --> 1003.72]  Okay, here we go.
[1003.72 --> 1008.72]  Wow, it's been so long since we, uh, since we switched scenes that I actually, uh, had
[1008.72 --> 1009.72]  that screen timeout.
[1009.72 --> 1014.72]  Okay, so, I think it's like paper sex and it's really angry.
[1014.72 --> 1015.72]  Yeah.
[1015.72 --> 1016.72]  Yeah.
[1016.72 --> 1017.72]  From the look of things.
[1017.72 --> 1018.72]  Oh.
[1018.72 --> 1019.72]  I'm not able to-
[1019.72 --> 1020.72]  Yeah, there we go.
[1020.72 --> 1023.72]  So, it's either angry or like-
[1023.72 --> 1026.72]  So, the one on top is like, I'm mad, but I'm doing this.
[1026.72 --> 1027.72]  Yeah.
[1027.72 --> 1030.72]  The one on the bottom is just kinda like holding it in there, but enjoys it, smiling.
[1030.72 --> 1031.72]  Everything's okay.
[1031.72 --> 1032.72]  Right.
[1032.72 --> 1033.72]  Didn't say no.
[1033.72 --> 1034.72]  So, Mario Can Eat Deluxe.
[1034.72 --> 1035.72]  Yeah.
[1035.72 --> 1036.72]  60 bucks.
[1036.72 --> 1037.72]  Okay.
[1037.72 --> 1038.72]  So, there's basketball.
[1038.72 --> 1042.72]  Um, there's a big green lollipop.
[1042.72 --> 1044.72]  And the yellow one is angry.
[1044.72 --> 1047.72]  Oh, the yellow one has got it in for the pink one there.
[1047.72 --> 1048.72]  It's going right for it.
[1048.72 --> 1049.72]  Yeah.
[1049.72 --> 1051.72]  Um, pink one's like, yeah, I'm ready.
[1051.72 --> 1052.72]  Okay.
[1052.72 --> 1053.72]  Basketball.
[1053.72 --> 1056.72]  Okay, so, is it like a puzzle game?
[1056.72 --> 1057.72]  I don't know.
[1057.72 --> 1058.72]  All right.
[1058.72 --> 1062.72]  It's action, action, comma, puzzles.
[1062.72 --> 1063.72]  Action, comma, puzzles.
[1063.72 --> 1064.72]  Cool.
[1064.72 --> 1067.72]  So, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is $60.
[1067.72 --> 1068.72]  Yeah.
[1068.72 --> 1070.72]  Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is the same cost as Breath of the Wild.
[1070.72 --> 1071.72]  So, basically, they're gonna sell-
[1071.72 --> 1072.72]  I already own Mario Kart 8.
[1072.72 --> 1077.72]  Well, 12 million Switches on launch day.
[1077.72 --> 1081.72]  And 12 million copies of Zelda on launch day.
[1081.72 --> 1085.72]  And then nothing for months, as far as I can tell.
[1085.72 --> 1087.72]  Arms looks like-
[1087.72 --> 1090.72]  Like, I can't believe this is its own stand-alone title.
[1090.72 --> 1092.72]  Is it like a boxing game?
[1092.72 --> 1093.72]  It's an arena.
[1093.72 --> 1094.72]  You wanna like play it?
[1094.72 --> 1095.72]  Yeah, sure.
[1095.72 --> 1096.72]  If you scroll down on your-
[1096.72 --> 1097.72]  If you go to the Nintendo thing, scroll down.
[1097.72 --> 1100.72]  I can't play it, because they're gonna like claim our video.
[1100.72 --> 1102.72]  Okay, so maybe don't then.
[1102.72 --> 1103.72]  Yeah, I'll just-
[1103.72 --> 1104.72]  I can play it for you here.
[1104.72 --> 1109.72]  Sure, I'm just gonna bring this up, so you guys can at least have a look at it.
[1109.72 --> 1113.72]  So, okay, yeah.
[1113.72 --> 1114.72]  Not gonna play that.
[1114.72 --> 1116.72]  The first fighting game of its kind.
[1116.72 --> 1121.72]  Choose a champion, equip your own combination of extendable arms, then a mix of button presses-
[1121.72 --> 1122.72]  So, okay, okay.
[1122.72 --> 1123.72]  So, it's Wii Boxing.
[1123.72 --> 1127.72]  It's Wii Boxing, essentially, as its own entire game.
[1127.72 --> 1134.72]  But you're gonna need- you need your own full set of the Joy-Cons, because one- each one is each arm.
[1134.72 --> 1136.72]  It's an arena combat game.
[1136.72 --> 1139.72]  So, it's Street Fighter, but Wii Boxing.
[1139.72 --> 1141.72]  And your arms extend.
[1141.72 --> 1145.72]  And if you turn the controller while you have your arm out-
[1145.72 --> 1149.72]  So, you punch and then you turn the controller, that will curve the fist.
[1149.72 --> 1156.72]  This is a full-priced game, which costs the same amount as Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild.
[1158.72 --> 1159.72]  And you can block.
[1159.72 --> 1160.72]  Yeah.
[1160.72 --> 1162.72]  Um, okay.
[1166.72 --> 1167.72]  So, moving on.
[1167.72 --> 1168.72]  Yeah.
[1168.72 --> 1170.72]  Um, the- oh, right.
[1170.72 --> 1173.72]  Super Mario Odyssey is the other one I was talking about.
[1173.72 --> 1174.72]  Okay.
[1174.72 --> 1175.72]  So, you wanna check out screenshots of that?
[1175.72 --> 1176.72]  Uh, yeah.
[1176.72 --> 1184.72]  We should probably move on, because this is enough of people sort of hearing us hate everything about this.
[1184.72 --> 1187.72]  I mean, you're gonna buy one anyway.
[1187.72 --> 1188.72]  I love it, and I'm gonna buy one.
[1188.72 --> 1189.72]  Yeah, okay.
[1190.72 --> 1191.72]  I think it's really cool.
[1192.72 --> 1193.72]  Are you gonna buy arms?
[1193.72 --> 1194.72]  No.
[1194.72 --> 1195.72]  Okay.
[1195.72 --> 1196.72]  I'm not gonna buy arms.
[1196.72 --> 1198.72]  I'm gonna buy Super Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.
[1198.72 --> 1199.72]  You're gonna buy Switch.
[1199.72 --> 1200.72]  Yeah.
[1200.72 --> 1201.72]  And you're gonna buy Breath of the Wild.
[1201.72 --> 1202.72]  Yeah.
[1202.72 --> 1203.72]  And you're gonna wait.
[1203.72 --> 1205.72]  No, I'm gonna get 1-2 Switch.
[1205.72 --> 1206.72]  You're gonna get 1-2 Switch?
[1206.72 --> 1207.72]  Oh, it doesn't come with it?
[1207.72 --> 1208.72]  I don't think so.
[1211.72 --> 1215.72]  The packages that I saw did not say that it included 1-2 Switch.
[1215.72 --> 1216.72]  It might.
[1216.72 --> 1220.72]  I bet you it comes with a demo disc-y thing with other games that aren't that.
[1223.72 --> 1224.72]  Nintendo Switch included games.
[1224.72 --> 1227.72]  No, no bundled games.
[1227.72 --> 1229.72]  So 1-2 Switch is like a full price game.
[1229.72 --> 1232.72]  So I'll buy it with 1-2 Switch and Breath of the Wild.
[1233.72 --> 1237.72]  And then I'll wait until Mario Kart 8 Deluxe comes out.
[1237.72 --> 1239.72]  And then I think I'm done for a while.
[1240.72 --> 1243.72]  Let's see.
[1243.72 --> 1249.72]  Mario Kart 8 maybe Splatoon 2, but probably not.
[1249.72 --> 1251.72]  And then it's Holiday 2017.
[1251.72 --> 1252.72]  As far as I can tell.
[1253.72 --> 1255.72]  Not gonna bother buy Skyrim.
[1255.72 --> 1256.72]  Yeah, Skyrim.
[1256.72 --> 1258.72]  Not gonna buy a basketball game.
[1258.72 --> 1260.72]  Definitely not gonna buy Snipperclips.
[1260.72 --> 1265.72]  Skyrim for all of the people who don't own Skyrim on any of the platforms.
[1265.72 --> 1266.72]  It's sorta cool.
[1266.72 --> 1269.72]  It's on every platform already.
[1270.72 --> 1271.72]  It's sorta cool.
[1271.72 --> 1272.72]  Literally every platform.
[1273.72 --> 1275.72]  Other things that they- I don't think this is a comprehensive-
[1275.72 --> 1276.72]  Your mom wants to play Skyrim.
[1276.72 --> 1277.72]  This is not a-
[1277.72 --> 1278.72]  No, Witcher 3.
[1278.72 --> 1279.72]  Witcher 3.
[1279.72 --> 1280.72]  Witcher 3.
[1280.72 --> 1281.72]  This is not a comprehensive list though.
[1281.72 --> 1282.72]  Colton's mom doesn't even wanna play Skyrim.
[1282.72 --> 1284.72]  There's no way this is a comprehensive list.
[1284.72 --> 1288.72]  Because there was at least one game that I saw that isn't on here.
[1288.72 --> 1290.72]  And there's a few others as well.
[1290.72 --> 1294.72]  There isn't a- man, what's that game that Brandon just loves and is actually really fun?
[1294.72 --> 1295.72]  I don't remember.
[1295.72 --> 1296.72]  It's a JRPG.
[1296.72 --> 1297.72]  It's really good.
[1297.72 --> 1298.72]  It's not on here.
[1298.72 --> 1301.72]  There's a few JRPGs that were announced that aren't on here.
[1301.72 --> 1305.72]  And I saw Minecraft in the art stuff that was flipping by and it's not on here.
[1305.72 --> 1306.72]  So there are other things.
[1306.72 --> 1308.72]  Skyrim runs on Linux.
[1308.72 --> 1309.72]  Polygon's list is not perfect.
[1309.72 --> 1311.72]  Skyrim runs on Linux.
[1311.72 --> 1312.72]  Nice.
[1312.72 --> 1313.72]  That's awesome.
[1313.72 --> 1314.72]  Terrible.
[1314.72 --> 1315.72]  That is actually awesome.
[1317.72 --> 1318.72]  Alright.
[1318.72 --> 1321.72]  Xenoblade 2, Fire Emblem, Diaga.
[1321.72 --> 1325.72]  There's some pretty major games that aren't not on Polygon's list.
[1325.72 --> 1326.72]  Okay.
[1326.72 --> 1327.72]  So I don't know what they're doing.
[1327.72 --> 1328.72]  Maybe they just don't have confirmed dates for them.
[1328.72 --> 1329.72]  So I didn't put them on the list.
[1329.72 --> 1331.72]  6.2 inch display.
[1331.72 --> 1332.72]  Fire Emblem, Diaga.
[1332.72 --> 1334.72]  720p multi-touch.
[1334.72 --> 1340.72]  2.5 to 6 hours of battery life can charge over a USB Type-C.
[1340.72 --> 1342.72]  That is a huge range.
[1342.72 --> 1344.72]  How do you get 6?
[1344.72 --> 1346.72]  Well, they're talking about different games and stuff.
[1346.72 --> 1351.72]  So if you play that weird snip clip game versus Breath of the Wild, it's probably...
[1351.72 --> 1352.72]  Okay.
[1352.72 --> 1353.72]  Fair enough.
[1353.72 --> 1354.72]  Yeah.
[1354.72 --> 1355.72]  Charge us over Type-C.
[1355.72 --> 1356.72]  Pretty cool.
[1356.72 --> 1358.72]  Nintendo not doing a proprietary connector.
[1358.72 --> 1359.72]  32 gigs on board.
[1359.72 --> 1360.72]  Expandable via micro SD.
[1360.72 --> 1361.72]  Very nice.
[1361.72 --> 1363.72]  I'm surprised they're not trying to sell us like a...
[1363.72 --> 1365.72]  Micro SD Type-C.
[1365.72 --> 1366.72]  $70...
[1366.72 --> 1367.72]  But you don't get an included game.
[1367.72 --> 1369.72]  But you don't get a game.
[1369.72 --> 1376.72]  It's like, okay, we will loosen the death grip we have on your wallets for accessories and expandable storage.
[1376.72 --> 1380.72]  And in return, you will pay us for the game development we did.
[1380.72 --> 1381.72]  Okay?
[1381.72 --> 1382.72]  Is that okay with everyone?
[1382.72 --> 1383.72]  Because we're okay with that.
[1383.72 --> 1385.72]  I mean, that sort of does make more sense.
[1385.72 --> 1391.72]  802.11ac Wi-Fi and up to 8 Switch consoles at once for local multiplayer.
[1391.72 --> 1392.72]  Because they do their own little Wi-Fi thing.
[1392.72 --> 1393.72]  Okay.
[1393.72 --> 1394.72]  Done.
[1394.72 --> 1395.72]  I'm gonna get one.
[1395.72 --> 1396.72]  We're gonna have a review of it.
[1396.72 --> 1397.72]  Everything's gonna be cool.
[1397.72 --> 1400.72]  I'm gonna buy not that many games, but the games that I do buy will be awesome.
[1400.72 --> 1409.72]  In other news, Razor's prototypes of Project Valerie were stolen.
[1409.72 --> 1410.72]  Bummer.
[1410.72 --> 1416.72]  They are offering a $25,000 reward for any information...
[1416.72 --> 1418.72]  I don't think any information.
[1418.72 --> 1425.72]  But basically, they are offering a reward for someone who helps them get it back or returns it.
[1425.72 --> 1429.72]  ...
[1429.72 --> 1431.72]  And everyone is blaming me and Tom Syndicate!
[1431.72 --> 1438.72]  So, I want to settle this once and for all.
[1438.72 --> 1440.72]  I will not admit...
[1440.72 --> 1441.72]  ...
[1441.72 --> 1442.72]  ...
[1442.72 --> 1443.72]  ...
[1443.72 --> 1444.72]  ...
[1444.72 --> 1445.72]  ...
[1445.72 --> 1447.72]  You gotta...
[1448.40 --> 1449.34]  There you go.
[1449.82 --> 1450.62]  That was a pretty good edit.
[1450.64 --> 1452.72]  This is circumstantial evidence at best.
[1452.72 --> 1453.34]  That was a pretty good edit.
[1454.02 --> 1454.46]  Circumstantial.
[1454.68 --> 1455.84]  That was a pretty damn good edit.
[1456.06 --> 1460.42]  I am clearly still at CES in this photograph.
[1460.42 --> 1464.60]  You know, it's a little awkward that you would have that at the AMD event.
[1466.22 --> 1473.88]  I really don't think that anything about the Ryzen poster over my right shoulder would indicate that I am...
[1473.88 --> 1474.50]  Does that mean you're...
[1474.50 --> 1475.66]  I'm in the Razor booth here.
[1475.72 --> 1476.80]  You're giving trade secrets?
[1476.92 --> 1478.12]  I'm in the Razor booth here.
[1478.20 --> 1478.66]  To AMD?
[1478.82 --> 1479.76]  Clearly in the Razor booth.
[1479.92 --> 1480.36]  Interesting.
[1480.88 --> 1481.28]  Obviously.
[1481.88 --> 1484.14]  2018, there's gonna be an AMD laptop.
[1484.32 --> 1485.22]  Three screens.
[1488.02 --> 1490.80]  And little did they know, they stole the worst idea ever.
[1494.42 --> 1496.58]  This is clearly much better evidence.
[1499.02 --> 1501.04]  I don't know why he's talking about me there, though.
[1501.06 --> 1501.94]  Let's just do that.
[1502.28 --> 1502.56]  There.
[1503.08 --> 1503.48]  Working.
[1504.28 --> 1504.54]  See?
[1504.54 --> 1507.52]  He is clearly poised to steal it.
[1508.90 --> 1509.34]  What?
[1509.54 --> 1510.24]  I don't get it.
[1510.36 --> 1511.54]  As for the third piece of evidence...
[1511.54 --> 1512.54]  Um...
[1512.54 --> 1514.54]  Okay.
[1518.70 --> 1519.02]  Okay.
[1519.22 --> 1522.02]  Now this, again, highly circumstantial.
[1522.50 --> 1524.34]  This is apparently a post from...
[1524.34 --> 1526.00]  A post from our forum?
[1526.00 --> 1528.70]  Our own users turning on me.
[1528.70 --> 1535.56]  This is from the CES WAN show to the part where Linus tells Austin they have a mutual acquaintance
[1535.56 --> 1541.78]  who offered Linus double sticker price to steal him or her an Acer Predator 21X.
[1541.78 --> 1549.14]  So, clearly, the offer was to steal a Predator 21X, which didn't go missing.
[1549.34 --> 1550.36]  Not the right one, bro.
[1550.38 --> 1550.60]  Yeah.
[1551.02 --> 1551.74]  So...
[1551.74 --> 1552.04]  Okay.
[1552.86 --> 1555.74]  I appreciate the evidence stuff and you trying to, like, dodge out of it.
[1555.78 --> 1557.16]  Obviously, Linus didn't steal it.
[1557.48 --> 1558.04]  That's fine.
[1558.10 --> 1558.66]  Everyone's joking.
[1558.74 --> 1559.14]  It's cool.
[1559.54 --> 1561.82]  How the freaking hell...
[1561.82 --> 1563.52]  Like, I'm sorry, Razor, that you've lost your thing.
[1563.62 --> 1563.78]  Yeah.
[1563.86 --> 1565.40]  How did you do that?
[1565.70 --> 1566.84]  So, I asked.
[1567.50 --> 1567.72]  Yeah.
[1567.82 --> 1570.52]  I emailed my PR guy there.
[1570.82 --> 1573.82]  I'm like, so is this a publicity stunt?
[1574.02 --> 1574.40]  Yeah.
[1574.52 --> 1576.00]  Because it really feels like it.
[1576.10 --> 1577.02]  And he's like, no.
[1578.02 --> 1578.34]  So...
[1578.34 --> 1578.96]  But how?
[1579.06 --> 1579.56]  Hold on.
[1579.68 --> 1580.02]  Hold on.
[1580.02 --> 1580.22]  Okay.
[1580.76 --> 1582.14]  So, I'll say this.
[1583.06 --> 1588.44]  Like, my Razor Contact is a straight shooter.
[1588.68 --> 1588.96]  Yeah.
[1589.52 --> 1590.54]  I trust him.
[1590.74 --> 1591.00]  Yeah.
[1591.00 --> 1592.60]  He's a good guy.
[1593.40 --> 1596.56]  He says, nah, they were legitimately taken.
[1597.18 --> 1600.94]  One of the back rooms was unlocked during the last 30 minutes of the show.
[1601.56 --> 1607.62]  So, the thing about the back rooms is that if you've ever been to, like, in the back of
[1607.62 --> 1610.94]  a CES booth before, I saw...
[1610.94 --> 1614.90]  Did you see the inside of the parrot control room that one year when they were doing the
[1614.90 --> 1615.90]  bebop dancing thing?
[1616.40 --> 1617.50]  It was incredible.
[1617.50 --> 1622.18]  It was like an entire additional parrot booth full of, like, drones and drone repair stuff
[1622.18 --> 1627.86]  and, like, all the sensors and crap that were running that automatic dance thing.
[1627.96 --> 1628.18]  Anyway.
[1628.18 --> 1631.12]  So, there can be a lot of, like, backroom stuff.
[1631.24 --> 1634.78]  Typically, those are accessible through a panel that opens in the back of the booth.
[1635.24 --> 1639.14]  So, all the Razor staff could have been running around doing things.
[1639.14 --> 1643.60]  Especially on the last day of the show, you tend to be a little bit more short-staffed because
[1643.60 --> 1648.96]  some people have flown out early or gotten tired or gotten sick by that point in the show.
[1649.30 --> 1650.72]  So, take your prototypes home.
[1650.72 --> 1654.28]  Not that easy to transport.
[1654.94 --> 1655.72]  They're very fragile.
[1656.08 --> 1657.24]  They wouldn't even let me pick it up.
[1657.28 --> 1659.66]  Yeah, but so the people leaving early should take them...
[1659.66 --> 1664.42]  But you still want them there in case you have to show them to, like, a partner or something.
[1664.68 --> 1665.28]  I mean, most...
[1665.28 --> 1666.22]  They probably didn't have meetings.
[1666.40 --> 1667.12]  So, okay.
[1667.40 --> 1668.16]  I'm saying this.
[1668.26 --> 1668.88]  You're not wrong.
[1669.64 --> 1670.46]  But I also get it.
[1670.46 --> 1670.48]  It's insanity.
[1670.58 --> 1671.06]  I...
[1671.06 --> 1673.88]  I don't know if I get it.
[1673.88 --> 1676.56]  I can comprehend what they're saying.
[1676.70 --> 1677.82]  And I think I'm leaving it there.
[1678.00 --> 1679.20]  That's how insane this is.
[1679.46 --> 1682.36]  I've had, like, terrible things at shows.
[1682.46 --> 1684.22]  Have security sensors on them.
[1684.48 --> 1688.28]  Whether it's, like, if it goes too far away from the booth, it starts beeping.
[1688.72 --> 1689.60]  I've had that.
[1690.08 --> 1692.24]  Not that hard to do, to be honest.
[1692.36 --> 1692.68]  Okay, fair enough.
[1692.68 --> 1694.60]  I've had, like, where it's on a cable.
[1694.82 --> 1697.68]  I've had where there's a little key thing.
[1697.82 --> 1698.16]  I don't remember.
[1698.42 --> 1700.60]  Kensington lock, which that thing probably doesn't have.
[1700.72 --> 1701.36]  But whatever.
[1701.36 --> 1702.50]  Yeah, it would, I guess.
[1702.50 --> 1704.98]  Because it's just a Blade Pro with a...
[1704.98 --> 1705.22]  Does this?
[1705.30 --> 1706.52]  This doesn't have a Kensington lock.
[1706.78 --> 1707.24]  Doesn't it?
[1707.44 --> 1708.36]  Do all the...
[1708.36 --> 1708.90]  Does mine?
[1709.14 --> 1709.42]  Oh.
[1709.90 --> 1711.90]  I don't think razor blades have Kensington.
[1711.98 --> 1712.56]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[1712.66 --> 1713.16]  Yeah, mine does.
[1713.50 --> 1714.18]  Oh, mine does.
[1714.42 --> 1715.52]  So, I guess the Pro does.
[1715.52 --> 1717.08]  So, the Stealth doesn't have one?
[1717.28 --> 1718.04]  No, I don't think so.
[1720.68 --> 1721.08]  Huh.
[1721.94 --> 1722.54]  That's funny.
[1722.60 --> 1724.62]  Because it's, like, the most stealable one.
[1724.84 --> 1725.04]  Yeah.
[1725.38 --> 1726.14]  No Kensington lock.
[1726.58 --> 1726.86]  Anyways.
[1728.24 --> 1729.38]  There's Kensington locks.
[1729.38 --> 1731.72]  There's security tags.
[1731.72 --> 1733.50]  There's distance, whatever.
[1733.70 --> 1734.22]  Fun fact.
[1734.54 --> 1745.34]  LG had the security sticker on a still plastic wrapped laptop for the LG Gram.
[1745.54 --> 1748.82]  I was tempted to take it off and just see if it would go off.
[1749.46 --> 1750.86]  I decided not to.
[1750.94 --> 1751.66]  I decided against it.
[1751.68 --> 1753.04]  I'd already been yelled at at Sony.
[1753.04 --> 1758.08]  People are accusing me of faking, like, me getting yelled at there.
[1758.54 --> 1759.90]  But, no.
[1760.14 --> 1765.04]  Like, six people were, like, running towards me, telling me to get off the stage.
[1765.10 --> 1767.86]  Because I legitimately did have permission.
[1767.86 --> 1772.34]  Just like I do normally have permission to do the outlandish stuff that I do.
[1772.54 --> 1778.22]  I had permission from one guy who didn't communicate to everyone else that I was going to be jumping up on the stage.
[1778.24 --> 1783.38]  Because they were hardcore about people not going up there and looking at Cletus.
[1783.38 --> 1790.06]  Which is the big, like, modular display thing.
[1790.24 --> 1793.94]  Because if you touch Sony's Cletus, it could be damaged.
[1796.90 --> 1803.24]  Oh, I did not see that.
[1803.38 --> 1808.26]  In all seriousness, though, the Cletus display is very fragile.
[1808.26 --> 1811.56]  So you don't want to rub it too hard.
[1812.24 --> 1813.38]  Just the right amount.
[1813.60 --> 1814.50]  Just the right amount.
[1816.34 --> 1817.84]  You might misalign it.
[1820.34 --> 1821.44]  We lost it there.
[1821.92 --> 1822.58]  It's cool.
[1822.84 --> 1823.52]  Just forget it.
[1823.78 --> 1825.26]  Everybody just don't worry about it.
[1825.42 --> 1825.54]  Yeah.
[1826.38 --> 1830.06]  You know what we do have to worry about is our sponsors for today.
[1830.42 --> 1830.68]  Yay.
[1831.02 --> 1832.92]  This WAN show is brought to you by...
[1832.92 --> 1833.74]  Ooh, I fix it.
[1833.82 --> 1834.86]  I fix it.
[1834.86 --> 1836.90]  But they saved my...
[1836.90 --> 1838.52]  Well, actually, Brandon specifically...
[1838.52 --> 1840.36]  A huge unintentional sponsor of CES.
[1840.38 --> 1840.62]  Yeah.
[1840.82 --> 1842.72]  Saved my bacon at the show.
[1842.88 --> 1844.10]  I thought about it.
[1844.56 --> 1847.74]  I had my iFixit kit in my backpack.
[1848.52 --> 1850.04]  And I was like, should I take it?
[1850.12 --> 1850.94]  Should I not take it?
[1851.00 --> 1856.60]  Because every other year, I've, like, brought tools and then not ended up using them.
[1857.62 --> 1859.44]  Then you used it so much this year.
[1859.82 --> 1862.04]  So Brandon had it with him.
[1862.04 --> 1863.24]  So I got to Acer.
[1863.32 --> 1864.50]  It was the first booth I did.
[1865.20 --> 1867.72]  And immediately, I...
[1867.72 --> 1868.66]  There were a couple things.
[1868.92 --> 1872.24]  Immediately, I saw the Predator 21X and I had to open it.
[1872.52 --> 1874.72]  I was like, I need to see the inside.
[1874.90 --> 1876.40]  It ended up being kind of anticlimactic.
[1876.50 --> 1879.36]  When I get my unit, I'm going to have to spend some real time.
[1879.44 --> 1881.16]  Like, it's going to take me a couple hours to tear it down.
[1881.30 --> 1881.46]  Yeah.
[1881.50 --> 1884.48]  Because they have, like, a mid plate and stuff to really get at the hardware.
[1884.84 --> 1885.08]  Okay, yeah.
[1885.72 --> 1887.40]  But I was like, immediately, I have to open it.
[1887.50 --> 1889.48]  And I was like, I can't believe I left that at home.
[1889.52 --> 1890.54]  And Brandon's like, oh, I've got mine.
[1891.06 --> 1892.78]  And I'm like, give it to me.
[1892.78 --> 1893.88]  And he's like, oh, it's back in the hotel.
[1893.88 --> 1895.30]  I'm like, Colton, go get it.
[1895.96 --> 1897.30]  So Colton went and got it.
[1897.60 --> 1900.50]  And then the other thing was also, again, in the Acer booth.
[1901.22 --> 1907.10]  They weren't sure about the drive options in one of the laptops.
[1907.18 --> 1908.64]  Remember, these are engineering sample laptops.
[1908.82 --> 1910.52]  Like, even some of the hardware wasn't final.
[1910.64 --> 1913.42]  There was one with a TN panel and the spec sheet said IPS.
[1913.66 --> 1914.52]  And I was like, what's going on?
[1914.52 --> 1916.36]  And they're like, oh, I don't know.
[1916.40 --> 1917.00]  We'll find out.
[1917.10 --> 1918.16]  So they had to call HQ.
[1918.50 --> 1922.88]  And it turns out that on early engineering samples, they just throw cheap OTNs in them.
[1923.08 --> 1923.90]  Sort of makes sense.
[1923.92 --> 1924.68]  To save some cost.
[1924.76 --> 1927.34]  And I was like, oh, you probably shouldn't have that at a trade show.
[1927.42 --> 1927.82]  But sure.
[1929.04 --> 1929.80]  Anyway, sorry.
[1929.94 --> 1930.42]  iFixit.
[1930.48 --> 1930.64]  Right.
[1930.94 --> 1933.24]  They make great tools for, oh, yeah.
[1933.24 --> 1935.66]  They've got guides on their website for repairing your electronics.
[1935.66 --> 1936.32]  I met the guy.
[1936.46 --> 1937.16]  And upgrading them.
[1937.42 --> 1937.64]  What?
[1937.86 --> 1938.16]  Yeah.
[1938.60 --> 1938.96]  What guy?
[1939.04 --> 1939.76]  Super randomly.
[1940.38 --> 1940.66]  What?
[1940.82 --> 1941.00]  Who?
[1941.30 --> 1942.50]  Like, the iFixit guy.
[1942.80 --> 1943.62]  I can't remember his name right now.
[1944.66 --> 1945.70]  Like, the guy.
[1945.78 --> 1946.64]  Hopefully he's not watching.
[1946.94 --> 1947.78]  CEO guy.
[1947.84 --> 1948.32]  Oh, really?
[1948.44 --> 1948.62]  Yeah.
[1949.30 --> 1950.34]  Oh, I thought you meant, like, our rep.
[1950.36 --> 1951.02]  He's super cool.
[1951.20 --> 1952.00]  Met him at HP.
[1952.30 --> 1952.58]  Oh.
[1952.78 --> 1956.04]  He grilled them with me, which was actually hilariously awesome.
[1956.78 --> 1958.00]  We were both talking about the Omen.
[1958.40 --> 1963.34]  And I brought up about how he gave the Microsoft Surface Studio a 5 out of 10 repairability score.
[1963.34 --> 1963.44]  Yeah.
[1963.56 --> 1965.62]  And how that was, like, kind of hilarious and true.
[1965.94 --> 1967.66]  And we talked about that for a second.
[1967.72 --> 1967.90]  Yeah.
[1967.90 --> 1972.16]  And then he, like, laughed at their case, which was great.
[1972.22 --> 1972.50]  No!
[1972.78 --> 1974.02]  Like, right in front of them.
[1974.24 --> 1974.88]  No filter.
[1975.02 --> 1976.38]  I was like, you are so cool.
[1978.26 --> 1981.90]  And I've been, like, trying to go back and forth with this HP guy for a while.
[1981.98 --> 1985.40]  Like, man, like, why is your I.O. on your motherboard so lacking?
[1985.66 --> 1986.38]  And, like, all this kind of stuff.
[1986.42 --> 1987.60]  Because they have their own custom motherboard.
[1987.78 --> 1989.80]  And, like, he's like, oh, what else do you want?
[1989.86 --> 1991.98]  And then I was like, any audio options?
[1991.98 --> 1992.92]  And I don't know.
[1993.02 --> 1994.10]  We were going back and forth a little bit.
[1994.10 --> 2000.62]  And then iFixit guy comes up and just, like, doesn't even wait for the HP guy to, like, possibly come back with anything.
[2000.70 --> 2002.92]  And it's just like, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
[2003.04 --> 2003.42]  All right.
[2003.48 --> 2004.62]  Like, bye.
[2005.42 --> 2006.98]  It was really cool.
[2007.42 --> 2007.82]  Terrible.
[2008.04 --> 2008.34]  Savage.
[2008.34 --> 2009.26]  It was awesome.
[2009.68 --> 2010.42]  That was cool.
[2010.64 --> 2022.40]  Anyway, so iFixit is all about repairing and upgrading your electronics yourself with their step-by-step guides and their huge inventory of replacement parts and tools with lifetime warranties for the tools, not the replacement parts.
[2023.22 --> 2029.34]  So today we're talking about their latest and greatest all-new ProTech toolkit, which you've seen featured...
[2029.34 --> 2036.60]  on the WAN show and on normal Linus Tech Tips content in the past, including, like, Scrappy Art Wars and other big things.
[2036.60 --> 2041.98]  Did I ever tell you about the time that I specifically said in a video that I was just using an iFixit kit and it wasn't sponsored by iFixit?
[2042.24 --> 2046.36]  Then the video production schedule got shifted and it ended up being sponsored by iFixit.
[2047.28 --> 2048.46]  Was that left in the video?
[2048.62 --> 2048.82]  Yeah.
[2049.08 --> 2049.98]  Oh, that's awkward.
[2050.12 --> 2050.30]  Yeah.
[2050.30 --> 2066.02]  Anyway, it has a bunch of prying tools, suction cups, poking tools, cutting tools, plying tools, anti-static tools, and a whack ton of screwdrivers and bits that have been enough for me to assemble or disassemble pretty much anything.
[2066.82 --> 2068.14]  And I'm going to do this again.
[2068.22 --> 2077.82]  I've done this before and I feel kind of terrible about it, but I'm going to criticize or offer constructive criticism about the product during a sponsor spot for the product.
[2077.82 --> 2085.72]  The one thing that gets me sometimes is deeper holes.
[2086.40 --> 2095.56]  You'll find them in the bottoms of laptops sometimes where the plastic hole is really deep until you can get to the screw.
[2096.04 --> 2099.50]  So there is a workaround and this saved me on the Predator.
[2099.98 --> 2100.72]  Was it the Predator?
[2101.26 --> 2101.54]  Whatever.
[2101.66 --> 2103.80]  One of the laptops, I almost didn't get open.
[2103.80 --> 2110.90]  So there's a workaround where you use one of the sockets and then you put the bit into the socket.
[2111.28 --> 2118.56]  But it would be nice to have like a longer shaft, like a super slim longer shaft extension type thing.
[2119.46 --> 2121.38]  That would be even better.
[2121.78 --> 2127.02]  But as it is, I've only very rarely been defeated when I have an iFixit kit in my hands.
[2127.10 --> 2129.04]  Anyway, what are we talking about again?
[2129.48 --> 2132.32]  The longer shaft that you would like to have.
[2132.32 --> 2132.84]  Wow.
[2133.48 --> 2147.34]  Okay, so grab an all new ProTech toolkit or their less expensive Essentials electronic toolkit by heading over to iFixit.com slash Linus and use offer code WANSHOW to save five bucks on your purchase of $10 or more.
[2147.52 --> 2148.78]  Highly recommended iFixit.
[2148.88 --> 2149.54]  We love their stuff.
[2149.62 --> 2150.04]  We really do.
[2150.48 --> 2151.66]  Your shaft is plenty long.
[2151.66 --> 2156.44]  I think that you can work on all of those laptops completely fine.
[2159.22 --> 2160.04]  You've got to be careful.
[2160.16 --> 2160.84]  I might work on you.
[2161.80 --> 2162.78]  That's why I know it's plenty.
[2162.94 --> 2164.30]  Anyways, fresh books.
[2166.02 --> 2166.92]  Fresh books.
[2166.92 --> 2174.56]  Okay, so if you're a freelancer, not that kind of freelancer.
[2174.68 --> 2176.08]  Not that kind of freelancer.
[2176.74 --> 2180.52]  I'm pretty sure most of them work sort of under the table.
[2180.78 --> 2181.00]  Cash deals?
[2181.62 --> 2182.76]  Cash deals.
[2182.88 --> 2184.38]  I'm pretty sure most clients don't want like a...
[2184.38 --> 2186.36]  I don't think you can accept roses on FreshBooks.
[2187.82 --> 2188.34]  Wow.
[2189.52 --> 2190.08]  Wow.
[2190.16 --> 2192.36]  Fresh books is totally dropping us.
[2192.56 --> 2193.04]  Restarting.
[2193.04 --> 2196.44]  Okay, so note for Colton.
[2197.16 --> 2198.92]  When you're linking the sponsor...
[2198.92 --> 2200.34]  Make the timestamp a little later.
[2200.34 --> 2203.26]  Yeah, leave the timestamp a little later for the FreshBooks spot.
[2203.28 --> 2205.94]  Should we do like one normal topic here to like give some extra buffer?
[2205.94 --> 2206.88]  No, we'll just pretend.
[2207.30 --> 2207.76]  So hold on.
[2207.78 --> 2208.30]  Give me one second.
[2210.06 --> 2216.64]  So that's why I was telling those guys that I really just think peaches make absolutely no sense in this context.
[2216.74 --> 2217.78]  It doesn't work with the case.
[2217.96 --> 2218.28]  I know.
[2218.44 --> 2218.72]  I know.
[2218.84 --> 2220.46]  Like why peach case?
[2220.64 --> 2220.78]  Yeah.
[2220.78 --> 2224.70]  Anyway, we should start up one of our sponsor spots here.
[2224.90 --> 2225.42]  FreshBooks.
[2225.54 --> 2228.50]  So FreshBooks is the easy to use invoicing...
[2228.50 --> 2233.32]  That helps small businesses look professional and get paid faster.
[2233.42 --> 2237.08]  You can try FreshBooks completely free for 30 days at freshbooks.com slash WAN.
[2237.48 --> 2239.40]  And make sure you type WAN in the how do you hear about a section.
[2239.48 --> 2240.22]  With no timestamps.
[2240.34 --> 2241.70]  Would you maybe do that?
[2241.70 --> 2251.56]  So FreshBooks lets you run a small computer repair business or accounting or John apparently needs Luke for something in the closet over there.
[2251.98 --> 2255.80]  And if you have any questions, you can reach out to their support staff.
[2255.92 --> 2256.04]  Right.
[2256.14 --> 2256.30]  Okay.
[2256.38 --> 2259.34]  So FreshBooks lets you create your invoices, send them.
[2259.42 --> 2260.32]  You can track your hours.
[2260.42 --> 2261.54]  You can track your expenses.
[2261.54 --> 2267.74]  You can see when people have seen your invoices, which takes the guessing games out of that whole rigmarole.
[2268.22 --> 2271.68]  And if you have any questions, you can reach out to their support staff where you'll speak to a real human.
[2271.82 --> 2272.44]  No phone treat.
[2272.54 --> 2273.24]  No escalations.
[2273.58 --> 2274.52]  Nothing like that.
[2274.60 --> 2276.12]  And they just got a mobile card reader.
[2276.20 --> 2281.52]  So check them out at freshbooks.com slash WAN and try out a free trial today.
[2283.72 --> 2284.16]  Wow.
[2284.16 --> 2286.90]  All righty then.
[2287.50 --> 2289.46]  So I'm by myself now, which is fine.
[2289.72 --> 2290.82]  Colton, everything's okay.
[2291.16 --> 2292.90]  Everything is okay.
[2294.14 --> 2295.14]  Everything is fine.
[2295.68 --> 2296.80]  Everything is awesome.
[2297.80 --> 2301.44]  Norway becomes the first country to kill FM radio.
[2301.58 --> 2303.48]  This was posted by Dat Speed on the forum.
[2303.74 --> 2303.98]  Wow.
[2304.16 --> 2305.36]  That poor Colton.
[2305.46 --> 2306.76]  He didn't even get to say anything.
[2308.86 --> 2310.06]  Just gone.
[2311.26 --> 2313.90]  Discover where Trump's America meets the world.
[2313.90 --> 2314.82]  What is this?
[2314.94 --> 2319.20]  This is an ad for subscribing to the Washington Post, which I definitely won't be doing.
[2319.70 --> 2320.14]  Okay.
[2320.30 --> 2321.46]  What am I looking at?
[2321.48 --> 2322.30]  Please sign in.
[2322.48 --> 2323.66]  I don't think you can read it.
[2327.14 --> 2329.98]  I don't think you can read it.
[2331.28 --> 2331.76]  Okay.
[2332.40 --> 2333.90]  Well, whatever.
[2334.24 --> 2334.76]  Get it right.
[2334.76 --> 2336.62]  That article was from the Washington Post.
[2337.12 --> 2339.92]  Now it's from engadget.com.
[2339.92 --> 2345.08]  It's like why this model doesn't work online.
[2346.04 --> 2347.00]  In a nutshell.
[2347.76 --> 2348.02]  Ooh.
[2349.60 --> 2351.90]  Norway killing FM radio.
[2352.08 --> 2359.94]  Only a quarter of the cars on the road are ready for the switch, which is more than I would have thought because the switch was just announced.
[2359.94 --> 2360.62]  Yeah.
[2363.12 --> 2363.56]  Yeah.
[2363.70 --> 2364.08]  Literally.
[2364.28 --> 2364.54]  Get it?
[2364.80 --> 2364.96]  Yeah.
[2365.96 --> 2374.40]  So Norway has started switching off FM transmitters as of January 11th, 2017, becoming the first in the world to dump the 80-year-old standard.
[2374.54 --> 2376.96]  They're switching over to digital audio broadcasting.
[2376.96 --> 2383.62]  This will give citizens more stations, better coverage, program time shifting, which is actually kind of cool.
[2383.74 --> 2385.10]  So that's like VOD, but odd.
[2385.40 --> 2387.68]  Just in case you didn't know, the acronym for that is DAB.
[2389.04 --> 2390.38]  Digital audio broadcasting?
[2391.58 --> 2392.10]  DAB.
[2393.84 --> 2394.48]  I'm not even going to.
[2395.16 --> 2395.48]  Yeah.
[2395.78 --> 2397.10]  That's all as far as I go.
[2397.54 --> 2401.94]  The majority of people are against the transition.
[2402.58 --> 2404.56]  We're simply not ready for this year.
[2404.56 --> 2405.00]  Someone.
[2406.82 --> 2407.98]  Like actually, yeah.
[2408.30 --> 2410.74]  Looking at numbers, they actually aren't.
[2410.90 --> 2416.48]  It reportedly cost between 120 to 230 US dollars for a DAB car radio adapter.
[2418.10 --> 2420.90]  DAB has been running alongside FM in Norway since 90.
[2420.92 --> 2422.10]  I've never even heard.
[2423.14 --> 2424.02]  Digital audio broadcasting?
[2424.12 --> 2424.30]  Yeah.
[2424.32 --> 2424.98]  Is this just serious?
[2425.98 --> 2426.90]  I don't think so.
[2426.94 --> 2427.60]  Or like, no.
[2427.90 --> 2428.10]  Yeah.
[2428.20 --> 2428.56]  No.
[2429.44 --> 2431.18]  Honestly, I've never even heard of it.
[2431.28 --> 2431.66]  I'm sorry.
[2431.66 --> 2435.50]  I'm pretty sure we've talked about it on Wancho, but like a ridiculously long time ago.
[2436.08 --> 2436.60]  Like, okay.
[2436.68 --> 2440.52]  In my real life, outside of like a news article that I read somewhere?
[2440.66 --> 2441.70]  Well, Canada doesn't.
[2442.56 --> 2442.92]  Okay.
[2443.10 --> 2443.16]  So that's why.
[2443.16 --> 2444.78]  We're not going to do that in a long time.
[2444.90 --> 2445.22]  Okay.
[2445.26 --> 2447.08]  I can pretty much guarantee you that's going to be quite a while.
[2447.48 --> 2449.90]  FM's like still pretty legit, right?
[2450.00 --> 2451.18]  Seems mostly fine.
[2451.64 --> 2452.16]  It works for me.
[2452.16 --> 2452.44]  There are.
[2452.54 --> 2452.70]  Okay.
[2452.78 --> 2453.04]  There are.
[2453.10 --> 2453.88]  I don't remember what they are.
[2453.88 --> 2454.80]  Am I becoming an old person?
[2454.80 --> 2455.12]  I've read.
[2456.30 --> 2456.92]  Not quite.
[2458.36 --> 2459.56]  I'm stressing out right now.
[2459.92 --> 2460.36]  You're fine.
[2460.36 --> 2461.34]  Don't worry about it.
[2463.02 --> 2463.34]  It's.
[2464.22 --> 2464.58]  Ugh.
[2466.32 --> 2466.64]  I only.
[2466.64 --> 2467.06]  It's fine.
[2467.24 --> 2467.90]  There's benefits.
[2468.12 --> 2471.36]  It's been a long time, so I don't want to say what they are because I'm probably going
[2471.36 --> 2472.60]  to get 90% of it wrong.
[2472.74 --> 2476.20]  But there are benefits to dab, whatever.
[2476.38 --> 2476.60]  Yeah.
[2476.60 --> 2477.22]  There's a lot of broadcasting.
[2477.22 --> 2477.80]  Time shift is cool.
[2478.02 --> 2480.24]  Like there's some cool stuff.
[2480.42 --> 2484.36]  But then if I was just going to like listen to podcasts, then like.
[2485.16 --> 2486.16]  I don't think it's that.
[2486.16 --> 2492.04]  Every radio show I listen to has a podcast version that I could use as a, as an audio
[2492.04 --> 2494.20]  on demand, like time shift thing anyway.
[2494.38 --> 2495.38]  I think it's different.
[2500.76 --> 2502.46]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[2502.64 --> 2504.40]  Across Europe and Asia Pacific.
[2504.52 --> 2507.22]  Well, that explains why I haven't really encountered it much.
[2507.40 --> 2507.66]  Yeah.
[2507.66 --> 2511.54]  I'm sure everyone in Twitch is just telling me I'm a complete idiot, but they're saying
[2511.54 --> 2512.82]  D-A-B, not dab.
[2513.48 --> 2513.86]  Whatever.
[2515.08 --> 2515.44]  Yeah.
[2515.52 --> 2515.92]  Who cares?
[2516.08 --> 2516.70]  That was a joke.
[2516.70 --> 2517.04]  Learn to love it.
[2517.16 --> 2517.88]  Learn to love it.
[2517.88 --> 2518.02]  It was a joke.
[2518.26 --> 2520.06]  Learn to love it because it's not going away.
[2520.18 --> 2522.18]  We're not the only ones that are going to make that joke either.
[2524.02 --> 2524.42]  Okay.
[2524.62 --> 2526.50]  The signals are so bad in whatever.
[2528.58 --> 2532.00]  Dab will suck because FMU can still hear with a bad signal.
[2532.14 --> 2533.00]  Dab is all or nothing.
[2533.34 --> 2533.54]  Yeah.
[2533.64 --> 2533.96]  Okay.
[2534.02 --> 2534.84]  It sounds about right.
[2534.84 --> 2536.16]  That sounds terrible.
[2536.16 --> 2538.16]  Yeah.
[2538.88 --> 2540.84]  I think I sort of get it.
[2541.58 --> 2546.16]  The Dab standard was initiated as a European research product in the 1960s.
[2547.08 --> 2551.60]  The Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation launched the first Dab channel in the world.
[2551.78 --> 2553.24]  So they're trying to do that again.
[2553.48 --> 2553.80]  Okay.
[2554.26 --> 2554.70]  Cool.
[2555.40 --> 2556.64]  Well, good luck with that.
[2557.88 --> 2561.52]  I really do feel like an old person though because I was about to say, like it was halfway
[2561.52 --> 2566.60]  out of my mouth to say, whenever I turn on the radio, I just want to hear whatever's
[2566.60 --> 2567.46]  on there right now.
[2567.54 --> 2572.46]  Like I have no, I have no use for fiddling around with it, but I sound like my parents
[2572.46 --> 2574.54]  talking about like TiVo.
[2574.68 --> 2574.86]  Okay.
[2574.86 --> 2575.80]  But there's both.
[2575.80 --> 2578.82]  Because you'll also listen to other stuff like through your phone and stuff.
[2579.14 --> 2581.08]  And I will do Bluetooth through my phone.
[2581.52 --> 2581.62]  Yeah.
[2581.62 --> 2584.48]  Or if I'm like, oh, that's screwed up or it's paused or whatever.
[2584.54 --> 2585.44]  I don't feel like pulling it out.
[2585.54 --> 2585.86]  Whatever.
[2586.58 --> 2587.40]  FM on.
[2587.48 --> 2590.36]  And it goes on to one of the two radio stations that I listen to and I'm like, cool.
[2590.62 --> 2591.38]  I have something.
[2591.50 --> 2592.58]  That's all I really care about for now.
[2592.82 --> 2593.90]  I'll fix it later.
[2594.02 --> 2594.26]  Right.
[2594.26 --> 2597.14]  Or if I'm going on like a long drive, I'll make sure it's all good.
[2597.22 --> 2598.28]  My podcast, whatever.
[2598.50 --> 2598.60]  Right.
[2599.06 --> 2601.28]  Book from Bill Nye, whatever I'm currently listening to.
[2602.40 --> 2605.16]  I don't think we've had Audible book, Audible as a sponsor for a while.
[2605.16 --> 2605.82]  Yeah, it's been a while.
[2605.94 --> 2607.20]  But I listened to books through there.
[2608.68 --> 2609.24]  All right.
[2609.44 --> 2612.36]  So in other news, the Nokia 6.
[2612.60 --> 2615.40]  Nokia's first Android smartphone is official.
[2615.60 --> 2619.16]  And it is totally different from every other Android smartphone.
[2620.16 --> 2621.30]  Smartphone totally different.
[2621.90 --> 2623.08]  4 gigs of RAM.
[2623.58 --> 2624.16]  Snapdragon 430.
[2625.58 --> 2626.86]  64 gigs of storage.
[2626.96 --> 2627.56]  Micro SD.
[2627.86 --> 2630.20]  16 megapixel main camera, which means nothing, by the way.
[2630.56 --> 2631.86]  3,000 milliamp hour battery.
[2632.06 --> 2633.22]  5.5 inch display.
[2633.46 --> 2634.46]  1080p resolution.
[2634.46 --> 2635.80]  Android Nougat OS.
[2636.12 --> 2636.88]  245 bucks.
[2637.34 --> 2638.16]  Launching in China.
[2639.28 --> 2641.54]  It will go on sale in early 2017.
[2642.10 --> 2644.84]  Available exclusively through retailerjd.com.
[2644.90 --> 2645.50]  See, that's different.
[2645.56 --> 2646.34]  The price is good.
[2646.82 --> 2647.16]  Yes.
[2647.38 --> 2650.02]  The retail exclusivity is different.
[2650.46 --> 2651.18]  Not good.
[2651.90 --> 2652.34]  At all.
[2653.62 --> 2654.86]  Well, do you really want one?
[2655.20 --> 2655.50]  No.
[2655.66 --> 2657.94]  So even if it's not good, it's not bad.
[2658.20 --> 2658.92]  It's just nothing.
[2658.92 --> 2660.50]  Well, it's bad for people that do want one.
[2660.92 --> 2661.62]  Who would want one?
[2661.62 --> 2662.86]  I don't know.
[2663.50 --> 2666.54]  It represents the modern design ethics of a smartphone.
[2666.54 --> 2668.00]  Yes, except for ashes.
[2671.84 --> 2672.58]  Good call.
[2673.62 --> 2674.10]  Okay.
[2674.46 --> 2674.74]  Well.
[2674.96 --> 2675.70]  Thanks, John.
[2675.70 --> 2680.34]  In other news, HDMI 2.1 was announced at CES.
[2680.54 --> 2683.38]  So the original post here is actually from AVS forum.
[2683.92 --> 2684.16]  Yeah.
[2684.28 --> 2687.88]  So it includes, this is like a very significant upgrade.
[2688.04 --> 2693.44]  So HDMI 2.0, which took long enough to get adopted, went from 10.2 to 18 gigabit per second.
[2693.44 --> 2695.30]  So that gives us 4K 60 hertz.
[2696.34 --> 2702.44]  HDMI 2.1 looks to be taking on DisplayPort 1.3 and 1.4 head on.
[2703.74 --> 2705.64]  48 gigabit per second.
[2705.80 --> 2712.20]  So HDMI 2.1 is designed to handle 8K resolution at up to 60 FPS.
[2712.96 --> 2718.82]  4K at 120 FPS, although that math doesn't quite work out, with support for dynamic HDR metadata.
[2718.82 --> 2722.76]  So dynamic HDR is different from static HDR, which is what we have today.
[2722.98 --> 2734.82]  The final spec to be announced in Q2 of 2017, at which point all of your fancy new HDR TV in 4K whatever can just get wrecked.
[2734.82 --> 2742.70]  This is great, because no matter how cool DisplayPort and stuff is, HDMI sort of wins.
[2743.76 --> 2744.62]  This is fun.
[2744.70 --> 2747.78]  The original article here is from LiveScience or LiveScience.com.
[2747.78 --> 2748.04]  Oh, yeah.
[2748.08 --> 2748.84]  This is super cool.
[2749.02 --> 2753.82]  The U.S. Army wants biodegradable bullets that sprout plants.
[2754.96 --> 2757.44]  Make love at the same time as war.
[2759.84 --> 2761.54]  It's all like hippie and whatnot, right?
[2761.76 --> 2763.82]  You know, you've got to plant some plants.
[2763.82 --> 2764.52]  Plant some plants.
[2764.60 --> 2765.08]  I think it's cool.
[2765.14 --> 2765.80]  Kill some people.
[2766.50 --> 2768.24]  So here's what I...
[2768.24 --> 2771.36]  Okay.
[2772.04 --> 2774.18]  So currently, here's the explanation.
[2774.74 --> 2779.12]  Currently, the U.S. Army manufactures and consumes hundreds of thousands of training rounds.
[2779.28 --> 2781.28]  Oh, training rounds.
[2781.64 --> 2787.68]  So they don't intend to actually plant plants in the countries that they are stomping on.
[2787.80 --> 2787.96]  Yeah.
[2788.96 --> 2790.08]  Now it makes more sense.
[2790.10 --> 2790.40]  Just back home.
[2790.40 --> 2796.76]  These rounds are fired at proving grounds and training ranges in the United States and around the world.
[2797.08 --> 2801.58]  The materials in the current training rounds need hundreds of years or more to biodegrade.
[2801.58 --> 2818.54]  So the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory, SCURL, has demonstrated bioengineered seeds that can be embedded into the biodegradable composites and that will not germinate until they have been in the ground for several months.
[2818.54 --> 2826.72]  So if you just, like, change your targeting range every several months, then it'll turn into a patch of trees, I guess.
[2827.72 --> 2829.18]  Or plants in general.
[2829.74 --> 2830.48]  That's cool.
[2831.66 --> 2832.02]  Okay.
[2832.38 --> 2832.76]  Hooray.
[2833.06 --> 2836.18]  Consumer Reports now magically recommends the MacBook Pro.
[2836.32 --> 2836.96]  Well, it's not magic.
[2837.16 --> 2840.10]  It's a software update that apparently fixed the battery life issues.
[2840.18 --> 2843.54]  What I want to know is how fast the processor is running now, but that's a whole other conversation.
[2843.54 --> 2846.76]  So there you go.
[2846.84 --> 2854.28]  Basically, one model ran at 18.75 hours on a charge, which is pretty fantastic.
[2855.16 --> 2862.94]  They tested each model multiple times using the new software following the same protocol that they apply to hundreds of laptops every year.
[2862.94 --> 2877.42]  So earlier when they evaluated them, the results were highly inconsistent, anywhere from 3.75 to up to 19.5 hours between charges, which is obviously a bit of a problem.
[2877.94 --> 2883.94]  So another option, because you ran into some serious issues when you were trying to do battery life testing on Windows 10.
[2884.02 --> 2884.44]  Yes.
[2884.44 --> 2886.80]  Where you would have ranges of hours.
[2887.22 --> 2888.26]  Like many hours.
[2888.26 --> 2889.30]  On the same laptop.
[2889.50 --> 2889.82]  Yes.
[2890.40 --> 2892.30]  Doing the same test back to back.
[2893.42 --> 2900.20]  So Luke's theory is that it has to do with a bunch of telemetry and background services and processes.
[2900.20 --> 2901.64]  Like other Funko stuff that Windows 10 is doing.
[2901.82 --> 2908.84]  And even with a lot of guides, like stop Windows 10 from creeping on me guides and stuff, which turn off a lot of it.
[2909.28 --> 2911.20]  But it's still fishy.
[2911.92 --> 2912.20]  Right.
[2912.20 --> 2914.04]  There's still weird stuff.
[2914.98 --> 2915.40]  Windows 10.
[2915.50 --> 2916.72]  And it's hard to monitor.
[2917.88 --> 2922.38]  Because if I'm going to monitor it, it just like massively increases the time that I'd work on the project.
[2922.56 --> 2923.32]  And it changes it.
[2923.82 --> 2925.66]  Like you have to actively be there.
[2925.86 --> 2926.60]  And there's a lot of.
[2926.98 --> 2927.26]  Yeah.
[2927.42 --> 2929.04]  It makes the scale kind of ridiculous.
[2931.22 --> 2934.22]  Chrysler pulled a VW, cheated their emissions test.
[2934.62 --> 2936.46]  Oh, still loading engadget.com.
[2937.10 --> 2937.60]  We'll get there.
[2937.60 --> 2943.00]  The EPA says Chrysler is violating the Clean Air Act.
[2943.22 --> 2945.18]  How long is the Clean Air Act going to last?
[2947.98 --> 2949.96]  Well, actually, probably a long time now.
[2950.26 --> 2952.36]  Because they're just going to sue the crap of them.
[2952.62 --> 2952.96]  Oh.
[2952.96 --> 2953.20]  Oh.
[2955.20 --> 2955.98]  Blah, blah, blah.
[2956.32 --> 2957.22]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[2958.14 --> 2964.16]  Trump also made specific and ambiguous promises about energy, environmental statutes like the Clean Air Act.
[2965.74 --> 2966.42]  Blah, blah, blah.
[2966.68 --> 2967.38]  Oh, okay.
[2968.24 --> 2968.88]  Not sure.
[2969.38 --> 2969.64]  Okay.
[2969.78 --> 2970.00]  Okay.
[2970.08 --> 2974.46]  I had thought I had read something saying that he had an actual plan for it, but I must have been mistaken.
[2976.16 --> 2976.88]  Uh, okay.
[2976.88 --> 2979.86]  I love how software, like, this must have been a really rough week.
[2980.08 --> 2982.46]  Because, like, Slack being on the Windows Store.
[2983.92 --> 2984.32]  Yeah.
[2984.92 --> 2987.06]  Well, I mean, that's the thing about CES.
[2987.22 --> 2988.94]  It's like, there's nothing the week before.
[2989.12 --> 2990.46]  Then it's like, boom!
[2990.62 --> 2991.86]  And then there's nothing right after.
[2991.92 --> 2993.34]  And then there's nothing right after.
[2993.34 --> 2999.78]  Unless, like, something that happened the week before at CES gets stolen, for example.
[2999.90 --> 3000.06]  Yeah.
[3000.18 --> 3000.90]  Yeah, then there's something.
[3001.18 --> 3001.28]  Yeah.
[3002.26 --> 3003.44]  Or is HDMI.
[3003.62 --> 3011.50]  Basically, the EPA is alleging that they installed software in some of their diesel vehicles that increased emissions beyond the company's claims.
[3012.04 --> 3021.90]  EPA says that light-duty model year 2014, 2015, and 2016 Grand Cherokees and Dodge Ram 1500 trucks with 3-liter diesel engines sold in the United States
[3021.90 --> 3024.14]  are releasing excess nitrogen oxide emissions.
[3024.64 --> 3028.18]  They allege that approximately 100,000 vehicles were covered in the claim.
[3029.06 --> 3034.38]  So, it's to a lesser degree than VW's controversy.
[3034.66 --> 3036.40]  It's only about a fifth as many vehicles.
[3037.42 --> 3037.96]  So what?
[3038.48 --> 3042.06]  Fiat Chrysler Automobiles is denying any wrongdoing at this time.
[3042.62 --> 3043.84]  So, we'll see how that goes.
[3043.96 --> 3044.12]  Yeah.
[3044.12 --> 3054.98]  I would be interested to see what a law would look like that punishes offenders more severely for denying it.
[3057.98 --> 3069.38]  I would be interested to see, like, if you screw up in a way that's, like, cheating, if the money that you have to pay goes towards competing industries.
[3070.32 --> 3070.60]  Hmm.
[3071.00 --> 3073.62]  So, if you have to actually, so if Chrysler had to pay Ford.
[3074.26 --> 3078.78]  Like, if somehow, let's, well, no, no, no, no, competing industries.
[3079.22 --> 3083.52]  So, it would be, like, say, like, solar panel companies somehow cheated at something.
[3083.62 --> 3083.90]  Yeah.
[3084.08 --> 3085.24]  They'd have to, like, pay.
[3085.34 --> 3085.84]  Big oil.
[3086.16 --> 3086.52]  Yeah.
[3087.60 --> 3090.32]  Probably going to go in reverse, just to be fair.
[3090.32 --> 3095.96]  But, like, it would be interesting to be, like, yeah, if you cheat and you get caught, you will directly aid your competition.
[3096.68 --> 3097.28]  Very interesting.
[3097.30 --> 3098.72]  Like, industry competition.
[3098.98 --> 3102.22]  Not, like, the company that's doing the same thing as you.
[3103.92 --> 3105.02]  I think that would be interesting.
[3105.26 --> 3106.82]  And not, like, you wouldn't give it to, like, Tesla.
[3107.06 --> 3109.66]  But you'd give it to, like, the grants that Tesla gets.
[3110.14 --> 3110.46]  Interesting.
[3110.70 --> 3113.14]  You know, like, the, like, electric car.
[3113.26 --> 3114.48]  Like, you buy it and you get money off.
[3114.56 --> 3114.80]  Yeah.
[3114.96 --> 3116.02]  It, like, goes towards that.
[3116.02 --> 3121.90]  So, you would be subsidizing people to buy things that aren't yours into a competing technology.
[3123.26 --> 3125.76]  That would get so messy so fast.
[3126.42 --> 3126.56]  Yeah.
[3127.10 --> 3127.50]  It would.
[3127.74 --> 3137.40]  So, there's a rumor over on WCCF Tech that the 1080 Ti could possibly be released at PAX East.
[3137.86 --> 3139.90]  I personally doubt it.
[3140.32 --> 3140.70]  Me too.
[3141.04 --> 3144.10]  I don't know anything for sure, but I doubt it will be at PAX East.
[3144.10 --> 3146.12]  When has NVIDIA cared about PAX East?
[3146.52 --> 3148.02]  Since when has anyone cared about it?
[3148.04 --> 3148.96]  Oh, game tabs, I guess.
[3149.06 --> 3149.26]  Yeah.
[3149.52 --> 3151.02]  Because it's, like, the first PAX of the year.
[3151.70 --> 3154.16]  So, that's actually why PAX Prime ended up being kind of a bummer.
[3154.16 --> 3157.04]  There's some interesting stuff in terms of games at PAX East.
[3157.72 --> 3159.96]  Hardware does not have a very strong presence there.
[3160.04 --> 3160.20]  Yeah.
[3160.22 --> 3161.36]  We know that from experience.
[3161.66 --> 3161.94]  Yeah.
[3162.06 --> 3164.50]  It's really hard to make videos at PAX East.
[3166.38 --> 3169.94]  It's easy to make videos at CES.
[3169.94 --> 3175.36]  There just often isn't, like, my problem would be, like, okay, this is my 14th case.
[3176.94 --> 3180.48]  I don't know if I can make another video about cases without people getting mad.
[3181.22 --> 3185.32]  But, like, at PAX East, bring a case.
[3185.98 --> 3186.48]  Please.
[3187.02 --> 3187.90]  Show me something.
[3188.40 --> 3189.70]  There's, like, never anything there.
[3189.70 --> 3190.30]  Some RGB.
[3190.76 --> 3191.84]  Some tempered glass.
[3192.08 --> 3193.54]  Just, just, just something.
[3193.54 --> 3196.36]  Make something out of RGB and tempered glass and we'll be fine.
[3196.36 --> 3198.86]  The problem is all the hardware guys just went to CES.
[3199.30 --> 3199.72]  Yeah.
[3200.10 --> 3202.18]  So, like, the, uh, I don't know.
[3202.46 --> 3204.46]  Okay, I'm gonna tease an upcoming video.
[3204.98 --> 3205.68]  Because I just can't contain this.
[3205.68 --> 3207.02]  Oh, man, really?
[3207.56 --> 3209.02]  I just can't contain this.
[3209.98 --> 3212.50]  Speaking of RGB, okay?
[3212.50 --> 3220.78]  I have a video on how you, too, can own the world's most, I'm not gonna show it to you
[3220.78 --> 3227.28]  guys too, too, too well here, but the world's most shiny RGB keyboard ever.
[3231.16 --> 3235.28]  Someone's just gonna grab that frame and then have it.
[3236.22 --> 3236.66]  Yes.
[3236.76 --> 3238.26]  I don't know if you can recreate that.
[3238.72 --> 3241.18]  You really have to, like, see it in glam footage.
[3241.18 --> 3245.52]  Um, we should do, like, a build called, like, the RGB build.
[3245.84 --> 3246.34]  Yeah, we should.
[3246.54 --> 3247.46]  And have, but no, no, no.
[3247.68 --> 3247.90]  Oh.
[3248.28 --> 3249.30]  We should do that, too.
[3249.64 --> 3249.96]  Okay.
[3250.12 --> 3253.26]  That we, I think they were, they were supposed to pitch it to someone, but anyways.
[3253.42 --> 3253.60]  Yeah.
[3253.72 --> 3254.20]  Um.
[3254.22 --> 3255.60]  We've been meaning to do that forever.
[3255.68 --> 3256.74]  You know Kyle just did one, right?
[3256.88 --> 3257.14]  Yeah.
[3257.26 --> 3257.46]  Yeah.
[3257.88 --> 3258.24]  Whatever.
[3258.80 --> 3260.62]  I wonder how long that's been on the list.
[3260.70 --> 3265.12]  I should go back in, like, the, uh, the, like, the dock, like, history and see when we
[3265.12 --> 3265.48]  added it.
[3265.50 --> 3268.32]  The original, like, Corsair RGB keyboard.
[3268.32 --> 3269.28]  We can one-up him, though.
[3269.28 --> 3272.78]  I found an RGB SSD at, uh, at CES.
[3272.88 --> 3274.22]  And I have some more plans, too.
[3274.32 --> 3276.10]  I want to, like, sync with room lighting and stuff.
[3276.36 --> 3276.68]  Anyways.
[3277.16 --> 3277.64]  Um.
[3277.74 --> 3278.10]  Chroma.
[3278.40 --> 3282.86]  I want to do an RGB build where we have, like, maybe, it would probably have to work with,
[3282.94 --> 3283.96]  like, levers or something.
[3284.36 --> 3287.86]  But, like, manually, literally just red, green, and blue.
[3287.98 --> 3291.16]  And you can, like, change the colors of the panels on your case.
[3291.16 --> 3299.72]  Maybe it was, like, cloth, and it, like, rolls up.
[3299.72 --> 3301.26]  And you can just show the...
[3301.26 --> 3303.18]  Here's what I'll say about this idea.
[3303.86 --> 3305.62]  Some of your ideas are really good.
[3308.26 --> 3309.56]  I think...
[3309.56 --> 3314.38]  We should totally do it.
[3314.62 --> 3315.50]  Come on, Twitch chat.
[3315.50 --> 3316.50]  You just want...
[3316.50 --> 3317.24]  I'm gonna make a truffle.
[3317.24 --> 3320.90]  You just want a pizza heating PC for 2017, don't you?
[3321.08 --> 3322.94]  Oh, I'm gonna make number two, I think.
[3323.46 --> 3325.04]  Number two pizza machine?
[3325.16 --> 3325.18]  Yeah.
[3325.28 --> 3328.14]  I need to work with someone, because I want to make it, like, really nice.
[3328.18 --> 3328.98]  But I have some ideas.
[3329.10 --> 3329.38]  Okay.
[3329.52 --> 3331.00]  I need it, like, machined and stuff.
[3332.02 --> 3333.26]  Like, it's gonna be sick.
[3333.40 --> 3333.66]  What?
[3333.92 --> 3336.74]  I also want to have, like, a pizza oven, like, built into it.
[3336.84 --> 3339.88]  So you could cook it and then, like, keep it heated.
[3339.88 --> 3341.66]  No, we've got some ideas.
[3341.80 --> 3343.94]  Pizza Heater 2 is gonna be real.
[3344.84 --> 3346.70]  We better get more dislikes this time.
[3346.84 --> 3350.78]  Anyways, um, real RGB PC.
[3352.06 --> 3352.52]  Yes.
[3353.08 --> 3353.56]  Yes.
[3354.38 --> 3354.66]  Yes.
[3354.66 --> 3355.50]  Oh, wow.
[3355.82 --> 3359.64]  You can't put all yeses in the answer for a straw poll.
[3359.66 --> 3361.70]  I didn't put all yeses, I just put three yeses.
[3361.72 --> 3362.10]  No.
[3362.90 --> 3363.38]  Terrible.
[3363.70 --> 3365.00]  There's just three different yeses.
[3365.06 --> 3367.22]  Okay, well, while you guys are voting on that,
[3367.22 --> 3372.38]  um, I will use this opportunity to tell you about the Floatplane Club.
[3372.74 --> 3373.10]  Hooray.
[3373.72 --> 3374.24]  Hooray.
[3375.94 --> 3378.60]  And I'm gonna post that instead of Luke's garbage.
[3379.22 --> 3381.84]  So that, yeah, it's gonna be a competition for,
[3382.16 --> 3385.22]  you shouldn't be, you shouldn't be fighting against my Floatplane Club posts.
[3385.52 --> 3387.46]  You want Floatplane Club to be a success.
[3387.70 --> 3388.16]  Yeah, that's right.
[3388.16 --> 3388.18]  I do.
[3388.18 --> 3388.74]  I wanna say.
[3388.74 --> 3389.24]  Yeah, that's right.
[3389.46 --> 3389.88]  That's right.
[3389.98 --> 3390.30]  That's right.
[3390.30 --> 3393.22]  People that are on the Floatplane Club, I'm sorry about the CES stuff.
[3393.22 --> 3397.38]  The plan was you guys were gonna get videos, like, as soon as we were done editing them,
[3397.40 --> 3400.12]  and you're gonna see them early, and then, like, eight of them didn't go up.
[3400.46 --> 3406.40]  So I'm pretty not stoked on the fact that that happened, and...
[3406.40 --> 3410.38]  But the idea behind it is that we have our own early access platform,
[3410.54 --> 3413.52]  which is actually a lot better than the last time we talked about it.
[3414.86 --> 3416.76]  20% of people are saying no.
[3417.52 --> 3419.22]  20% of people are saying no?
[3419.32 --> 3421.70]  That's a lot for, like, a video suggestion.
[3421.70 --> 3422.26]  Yeah.
[3422.72 --> 3424.12]  Maybe we don't have to do it.
[3424.48 --> 3425.64]  The real RGB PC?
[3425.72 --> 3426.36]  Oh, yeah.
[3426.46 --> 3426.96]  No, no.
[3427.04 --> 3428.18]  We do not have to do that.
[3429.44 --> 3429.84]  Maybe.
[3430.60 --> 3433.66]  So, basically, it's our early access platform.
[3433.98 --> 3435.96]  The way it works is...
[3435.96 --> 3436.78]  Oh, it's 19 now.
[3436.84 --> 3437.40]  Maybe we should.
[3438.62 --> 3439.24]  Maybe we should.
[3439.46 --> 3441.26]  Yeah, 20 is, like, a hard stop.
[3441.38 --> 3442.30]  That's a hard threshold.
[3442.48 --> 3443.32]  Oh, it's back up to 20.
[3443.40 --> 3443.56]  Shit.
[3447.48 --> 3447.88]  Terrible.
[3447.88 --> 3455.50]  I want to see if there's any way for me to show this without showing anything that I shouldn't show.
[3455.74 --> 3456.40]  I don't think so.
[3456.60 --> 3457.22]  There might be.
[3457.40 --> 3459.18]  You'd have to, like, do a weird zoom, but maybe.
[3460.50 --> 3460.90]  Okay.
[3461.34 --> 3462.42]  So that would work.
[3463.56 --> 3463.92]  Okay.
[3464.04 --> 3465.86]  So, basically, here we go.
[3465.92 --> 3467.46]  I will do this very carefully.
[3467.76 --> 3468.70]  Oh, God.
[3468.80 --> 3470.06]  I will do it very carefully.
[3470.06 --> 3470.78]  Because that's, like, ours.
[3471.00 --> 3472.06]  I will do it very carefully.
[3472.26 --> 3472.54]  Okay.
[3472.74 --> 3473.54]  So, this is John.
[3474.34 --> 3474.82]  Hi, John.
[3474.82 --> 3475.50]  And this is his post.
[3475.76 --> 3476.80]  Hi, John's post.
[3476.96 --> 3477.62]  Of a video.
[3478.12 --> 3478.82]  There's a video.
[3479.34 --> 3480.10]  That I can play.
[3480.76 --> 3482.26]  Hey, look how fast it started playing.
[3482.54 --> 3483.20]  Hey, look at that.
[3483.24 --> 3483.86]  Wasn't that cool?
[3484.42 --> 3486.16]  And then I could...
[3486.16 --> 3487.54]  Hold on.
[3487.62 --> 3488.04]  Hold on.
[3488.28 --> 3489.66]  And then I could go full screen.
[3490.10 --> 3490.76]  Oh, dang it.
[3491.18 --> 3492.28]  Careful when you come back out of it.
[3492.38 --> 3493.94]  Maybe switch to...
[3493.94 --> 3494.38]  Full screen.
[3494.90 --> 3495.14]  Woo!
[3495.28 --> 3496.56]  Okay, I'm not going to come back out of it.
[3496.56 --> 3496.66]  What the heck is that?
[3497.00 --> 3499.52]  I don't know, but it was really scary.
[3500.14 --> 3502.16]  So, anyway, that's a Tech Quickie video.
[3502.16 --> 3504.22]  That right now is not on YouTube.
[3504.86 --> 3510.88]  So, basically, Luke AL built a video streaming platform.
[3511.02 --> 3511.44]  Luke AL?
[3511.76 --> 3512.14]  AL.
[3512.40 --> 3514.64]  It's, like, and company.
[3515.34 --> 3515.60]  Oh.
[3516.90 --> 3518.12]  E-T-A-L.
[3518.52 --> 3518.74]  Gotcha.
[3519.48 --> 3520.82]  Built a video streaming platform.
[3520.94 --> 3524.24]  There's still a lot of stuff that is very much in progress.
[3524.66 --> 3527.54]  There's some really cool things that I think I want to, like...
[3527.54 --> 3528.64]  How much do you want to talk about?
[3528.74 --> 3529.76]  Okay, I think I want to release a video...
[3529.76 --> 3530.52]  Do you want to show that page?
[3531.52 --> 3531.92]  No.
[3532.16 --> 3533.18]  We can't show that page.
[3533.24 --> 3533.36]  No.
[3533.42 --> 3534.48]  Even if we don't show the IP.
[3534.78 --> 3535.62]  Let's not show that page.
[3535.62 --> 3536.62]  You don't want to show that page?
[3536.70 --> 3541.86]  Okay, but see, my theory is I think I want to launch a video on the Flowplane Club about
[3541.86 --> 3542.70]  those pages.
[3542.98 --> 3543.34]  Okay.
[3543.54 --> 3543.92]  All right.
[3544.06 --> 3545.58]  So, we show it to Flowplane Club first.
[3545.68 --> 3545.90]  Yeah.
[3546.20 --> 3546.64]  Fair enough.
[3547.06 --> 3547.36]  Okay.
[3547.36 --> 3550.60]  Anyway, so what we're working on is better image quality.
[3550.60 --> 3551.72]  We're going to have early access.
[3552.06 --> 3557.18]  We're going to try and have a less toxic sort of community vibe compared to YouTube, which
[3557.18 --> 3561.04]  was something a lot of Vessel viewers were really upset about losing.
[3561.46 --> 3563.42]  Right now, everything is done through the forum.
[3563.42 --> 3567.94]  But in the future, and development is how in progress.
[3568.30 --> 3569.70]  Very much so in progress.
[3569.78 --> 3570.20]  Very in progress.
[3570.20 --> 3571.38]  And it looks amazing.
[3571.92 --> 3573.82]  I just want to say, like, damn.
[3574.12 --> 3578.04]  For everyone that's worked on it, back end, front end, middle, CMS.
[3578.04 --> 3579.52]  CMS, low end.
[3579.60 --> 3580.10]  Top end.
[3580.52 --> 3581.92]  Eric, cat, Linus.
[3581.94 --> 3582.28]  Rear end.
[3582.30 --> 3583.18]  But not this one.
[3583.60 --> 3583.84]  Mortis.
[3583.84 --> 3584.92]  Yeah, different Linus, actually.
[3585.30 --> 3585.64]  Everyone.
[3585.90 --> 3588.84]  That's been, like, oh, very good.
[3589.76 --> 3590.34]  Very, very good.
[3593.12 --> 3594.00]  All right.
[3595.72 --> 3604.10]  Henry on Twitch says, who the three asteriskses, asteriskses, thinks we're toxic.
[3605.26 --> 3605.72]  Wow.
[3606.62 --> 3607.32]  Twitch chat.
[3608.76 --> 3609.52]  Twitch chat.
[3610.92 --> 3611.70]  Twitch chat.
[3613.16 --> 3613.56]  Anyways.
[3614.26 --> 3617.28]  Anyway, link one more time there so you guys can join.
[3618.10 --> 3619.44]  That's what we're calling it.
[3619.56 --> 3620.54]  It's three bucks a month.
[3622.10 --> 3622.42]  Yeah.
[3623.64 --> 3625.88]  Right now, it's very, very early access.
[3626.28 --> 3627.60]  But, yeah.
[3628.04 --> 3629.54]  I think that's pretty much it, right?
[3629.60 --> 3629.78]  Yeah.
[3630.02 --> 3630.72]  Do we have anything else?
[3630.90 --> 3631.10]  Nope.
[3631.32 --> 3631.62]  Okay.
[3631.74 --> 3632.38]  You have to get to your thing.
[3632.48 --> 3634.36]  Yeah, I've got badminton classes.
[3634.48 --> 3635.54]  I need to, like, leave.
[3635.68 --> 3636.42]  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[3636.42 --> 3636.60]  Oh.
[3636.90 --> 3637.66]  Okay, bye.
[3638.04 --> 3638.24]  Yeah.
[3639.06 --> 3639.98]  Bye, everyone.
[3640.32 --> 3640.74]  Animation.
[3641.24 --> 3642.20]  I don't think there's music.
[3643.76 --> 3645.24]  Well, it's like, YouTube isn't toxic.
[3645.38 --> 3645.92]  You're toxic.
[3647.44 --> 3649.58]  That's you saying that is toxic.
[3649.72 --> 3650.66]  Showbiz Pizza Bear.
[3650.80 --> 3654.08]  YouTube comments are worse than cancer, and I've had cancer.
[3654.56 --> 3658.24]  I don't believe you've actually had cancer if you say something like that.
[3658.24 --> 3661.86]  I'm pretty sure cancer is actually very terrible compared to YouTube comments.
[3663.54 --> 3664.38]  Good night, everybody.
[3664.38 --> 3664.44]  Good night, everybody.
