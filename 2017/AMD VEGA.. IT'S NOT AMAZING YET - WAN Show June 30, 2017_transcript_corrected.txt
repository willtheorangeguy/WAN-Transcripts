[0.00 → 7.18] And okay, we're actually live this time. Woo! We got that going. No problem. No big deal. Not a thing. Yeah.
[7.76 → 14.26] Oh, it is a thing, but it's an okay thing. So, we've got a great show for you guys today.
[15.02 → 19.00] I'm here. Luke's here. And, uh...
[19.52 → 20.80] John might be making an appearance.
[21.00 → 21.40] Really?
[21.66 → 23.10] For one specific topic.
[23.48 → 25.48] Oh, do we have another legal topic?
[25.90 → 26.12] Yes, yeah.
[26.12 → 30.06] Oh, I see. You know, those are actually some of the most interesting ones for me.
[30.32 → 30.70] Me too.
[30.96 → 36.20] Because he'll go off on something where he's like, I'll have some misconception or whatever.
[36.30 → 38.12] And he'll go off, and he'll be like, well, actually...
[39.30 → 43.30] It works this way or in this specific state or whatever.
[43.38 → 48.68] Yeah, it turns out that I got an education for a reason, and you probably should have gone to school and, you know...
[48.68 → 50.04] No, I disagree with that.
[50.92 → 53.44] For your specific use case, not for everybody.
[53.44 → 54.84] Really? Okay, you know what's funny?
[54.84 → 62.04] Is I actually had lunch with a local content producer earlier this week.
[62.28 → 69.60] Like, she does this kind of vertically integrated content production for business professionals.
[69.88 → 70.18] Okay.
[70.26 → 75.40] That's like about stocks and business tips and stuff like that.
[75.40 → 82.86] And apparently their program actually airs, among other things, on one of Fox's things, like a Fox business thing.
[82.94 → 83.24] Okay.
[83.38 → 85.56] And then also on, like, Air Canada flights.
[85.68 → 87.16] Like, very old media.
[87.44 → 87.72] Yeah.
[87.84 → 93.42] You know, like relationships with, you know, national airlines and, like, network TV.
[93.52 → 93.72] Yeah.
[93.72 → 93.80] Yeah.
[94.20 → 96.98] And anyway, so she wanted to have lunch.
[97.02 → 98.26] I had no idea what she wanted.
[98.60 → 100.20] Basically, we did, like, a studio tour.
[100.36 → 106.74] Taryn was instructed by someone who works with her doing some stuff over at BIT.
[106.74 → 113.60] And the funny thing is, Taryn brought me into their studio so that I could see how, like, a proper company does things.
[113.86 → 116.30] And maybe we should have edit suites.
[116.36 → 117.82] And maybe we should have this.
[117.86 → 119.10] And maybe we should have that.
[119.56 → 123.88] And it turned out that in much the same way as us, they learned as they went.
[123.92 → 125.80] And there were a lot of things they did better than us.
[125.80 → 127.50] And there are a lot of things we do better than them.
[127.50 → 130.20] So that was enlightening and fun.
[130.36 → 131.26] Did they do edit suites?
[131.52 → 132.50] They do have edit suites.
[132.76 → 132.80] Okay.
[132.90 → 134.10] That was what he wanted me to see.
[134.20 → 137.54] What he didn't want me to see was all the other kind of Jacky stuff.
[137.62 → 143.32] Like, the fact that they literally have footage archived on betas still.
[144.04 → 144.48] Whoa.
[145.16 → 145.36] Yeah.
[145.48 → 148.50] But remember, broadcast TV, that was a thing.
[148.58 → 149.84] But you'd think you'd move it.
[149.84 → 151.00] A lot more recently.
[151.76 → 156.12] Where you would actually be submitting finished projects by mailing a Betamax.
[156.12 → 158.10] Or not a Betamax.
[158.16 → 158.32] Sorry.
[158.46 → 160.98] It's like, they were two different standards.
[161.40 → 161.66] Yeah.
[162.24 → 165.74] Like, the broadcast tape version and the one that competed with VH.
[165.80 → 169.62] Anyway, the point is, they still have a shelf.
[169.64 → 170.78] And this is after they cleaned up.
[170.86 → 172.06] They have a shelf of betas.
[172.12 → 173.86] And I'm like, you're great.
[174.56 → 177.16] And I was telling them about the vault and stuff.
[177.20 → 178.76] And they were like, yeah, that would be pretty cool.
[178.76 → 180.70] And Taryn's like, yeah, that's pretty useful.
[180.80 → 183.14] Maybe I don't have an editing suite, but I do have that.
[183.14 → 186.18] But anyway, the point is, she asked me to have lunch with her.
[186.60 → 189.98] And she didn't really tell me what it was about.
[190.44 → 193.46] It turned out she wanted me to talk some sense into her son.
[194.14 → 194.46] Okay.
[194.62 → 199.36] Who had this idea in his head that he was going to, he has two videos uploaded to YouTube.
[199.48 → 202.00] And you know, you probably get this all the time too, right?
[202.28 → 205.10] People being like, how do I be a successful YouTuber?
[205.10 → 207.72] Especially on my, not to plug it, but especially on my stream.
[207.82 → 208.80] Yeah, especially on your streams.
[208.88 → 210.92] Because like, you have.
[211.14 → 212.96] Which is hilarious because my stream sucks.
[213.34 → 214.46] And like, nobody watches it.
[214.52 → 216.14] And people ask me how to be a successful streamer.
[216.24 → 217.58] And I'm like, you think I know.
[217.68 → 220.90] I'm glad you said that because I was going to crap on your stream a little bit.
[220.98 → 221.56] Yeah, no, it's terrible.
[221.56 → 222.42] I was going to be like, yeah.
[222.54 → 225.68] And your stream's not even that big or anything.
[225.68 → 226.64] I do it for fun and charity.
[226.64 → 234.72] But you have a lot more success streaming than, like, you know how it's like the first thousand subscribers on YouTube is the hardest?
[235.06 → 235.22] Right.
[235.46 → 238.48] You've passed that first handful of Twitch subscribers.
[238.60 → 239.88] And just never took a further step.
[240.04 → 242.20] And phoned it in the rest of the way.
[242.32 → 242.42] Yeah.
[243.26 → 246.74] But you clearly know enough to know a thing that people would ask you about it.
[246.80 → 254.50] Anyway, so usually when people ask that question, it starts with, yeah, I just uploaded my first video, or I just did my first stream.
[254.68 → 255.86] What would you recommend?
[256.64 → 261.56] And the guy's like, yeah, so I want to do, like, a fitness clothing line.
[261.80 → 264.34] And I want to do, like, a fitness lifestyle vlog.
[265.40 → 265.60] And...
[265.60 → 268.88] Way to compete against everyone.
[268.98 → 269.14] Yeah.
[269.32 → 274.46] And it was funny because his mom's giving me additional details.
[274.46 → 280.62] Like, yeah, he wants me to pay for plane tickets so he can, like, travel interesting places for his lifestyle vlog.
[280.62 → 281.58] Of course.
[281.82 → 284.08] And so I was like, all right, bro.
[284.08 → 291.72] One, I'm not going to side with your mom and just say straight up, stay in school.
[291.80 → 292.72] Could be a decent strategy.
[292.84 → 295.08] Because I didn't...
[295.08 → 295.50] Nothing.
[296.12 → 297.06] Don't worry about it.
[297.44 → 297.82] Really?
[300.62 → 302.96] I mean, if she's got plane tickets, go all around the world.
[303.16 → 303.52] Okay.
[303.74 → 304.06] All right.
[304.06 → 305.58] I thought you were going somewhere else with that.
[305.58 → 307.70] No, no, no, totally, no.
[308.10 → 308.42] Definitely.
[308.82 → 309.10] You're gross.
[309.10 → 309.78] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[311.54 → 312.40] Anyway, continue.
[312.58 → 312.74] Yeah.
[313.10 → 317.64] I'm not siding with his mom directly because, like, the whole school thing didn't work out very well for me.
[317.64 → 333.00] But I was also like, on the other hand, dude, if you're going to succeed as a social media influencer, you won't succeed unless you have, A, the passion, and B, the drive slash work ethic to do it on the side.
[333.22 → 333.38] Yeah.
[333.38 → 341.70] So if you don't have anything better to do, then stay in school, but don't lose track of that this should be your full-time side project.
[342.06 → 342.12] Yeah.
[342.22 → 343.82] And that was sort of the advice that I gave.
[343.94 → 347.46] And the guy, like, he looked like I, you know, punched him in the stomach.
[347.70 → 349.48] And I was bigger than I am.
[351.02 → 352.04] My biggest thing...
[352.04 → 352.48] Oh, my goodness.
[352.54 → 352.94] Thank you, Nick.
[353.66 → 356.12] My biggest thing is, like...
[356.12 → 358.08] Hey, Nick, Asus should be paying me for this.
[358.68 → 358.96] Yeah.
[359.10 → 361.80] I've been drinking out of this bottle on WAN show for years.
[362.18 → 362.46] Yeah.
[363.38 → 366.06] You call out that person who you called out in the Super fund.
[366.24 → 366.48] Yeah.
[366.62 → 366.86] Okay.
[366.94 → 367.56] Maybe I'll do that.
[367.72 → 371.78] I don't think he controls any budget spending there, so it won't do me any good, but that's fine.
[373.20 → 377.12] Hey, Asus, pay us the money for product placement, okay?
[377.12 → 382.54] See, you can never get money for product placement if you have product placement all over your stuff for free anyway.
[383.24 → 383.76] People are...
[383.76 → 386.18] Everyone looks at it, and they just go, why?
[386.80 → 387.28] So...
[387.28 → 388.06] Why would I pay for this?
[388.12 → 388.60] You're going to do it anyway.
[388.60 → 391.30] Have we ever done a successful straight-up product placement deal?
[391.30 → 392.30] Hmm.
[392.30 → 393.30] I don't think so.
[393.30 → 401.36] We tried to do something with a smartwatch, like with Pebble, I think, like a thousand years ago, and then Pebble wouldn't even send us review samples.
[401.48 → 401.68] Yeah.
[401.78 → 402.66] And then they got bought.
[403.16 → 403.42] Yeah.
[403.42 → 405.48] So that's about how successful we've been.
[405.82 → 406.38] Yeah.
[407.08 → 409.68] Maybe they should have done that marketing as well.
[409.68 → 409.94] Anyway.
[410.58 → 416.12] Okay, so my thing, especially when people are in his specific position, where you're like, he's uploaded two videos.
[416.28 → 416.52] Yes.
[417.12 → 419.66] My whole thing is like, I don't care and you shouldn't.
[420.24 → 420.48] Yeah.
[420.48 → 421.56] Upload way more.
[421.90 → 424.98] That's your big problem right now, is you just need to do it a bunch.
[425.04 → 425.16] Yeah.
[425.16 → 427.34] Because there's going to be things that you're missing.
[427.34 → 428.08] Learning from doing it.
[428.08 → 428.10] Doing it.
[428.40 → 429.16] Doing it.
[429.26 → 429.44] Yeah.
[429.58 → 429.76] Yeah.
[429.86 → 430.66] Learning from doing it.
[430.74 → 430.90] Yeah.
[430.96 → 431.12] Okay.
[431.18 → 431.36] Anyway.
[431.56 → 432.38] Like, you know.
[433.44 → 433.96] All right.
[433.98 → 434.66] Let's roll the intro.
[434.66 → 453.34] I don't know if the Land Show announcement went up.
[453.34 → 453.76] Oh, it did.
[453.82 → 454.22] Look at that.
[456.66 → 457.26] LTD!
[457.26 → 460.90] I'm actually getting a lot more confident that this is going to be a lot of fun.
[461.08 → 461.28] Yeah.
[461.68 → 463.34] The case toss was really fun.
[463.34 → 467.64] We put, we put, actually we put Colton's wife in charge of the event.
[467.80 → 468.04] Yeah.
[468.90 → 476.16] Because previously we had Colton in charge because they had such a wonderful and well-organized wedding.
[476.44 → 480.24] And then we found out that of course he had nothing to do with it, so we hired his wife.
[480.84 → 483.54] And she is doing a bang up job so far.
[483.54 → 485.70] There is going to be a lot of fun stuff to do.
[486.64 → 487.42] That's super cool.
[487.44 → 488.22] Also, FreshBooks.
[488.36 → 488.58] Yay!
[488.94 → 489.18] Woo!
[489.26 → 490.02] FreshBooks!
[490.78 → 492.54] And EK Water blocks.
[492.54 → 493.22] Water blocks.
[493.32 → 493.76] IRA-woobah?
[494.10 → 495.22] Now, hold on a second.
[495.58 → 496.24] Actually, you know what?
[496.24 → 497.62] I'll get into it in the sponsor spot.
[497.72 → 500.04] But that is not as crazy as it sounds.
[500.24 → 500.44] Yeah.
[500.66 → 502.50] That whole thing that I just put on the screen there.
[503.80 → 504.16] Uh.
[505.56 → 505.96] Okay.
[506.16 → 508.88] So, first, uh, first topic.
[509.34 → 509.86] You know what?
[510.14 → 512.08] Let's jump right into the good stuff today.
[512.08 → 513.08] Okay.
[513.08 → 518.82] The original article here is from PC Perspective, and it was posted on the forum by Skin.
[518.82 → 529.66] And our buddy, Mr. The One and Only Ryan Shroutastic got his hand on an AMD Vega Frontier Edition.
[529.88 → 532.90] And how he did this, I can tell you.
[533.38 → 534.48] He bought it.
[535.02 → 536.44] The same as we had to.
[536.72 → 537.52] Ours is in the mail.
[537.86 → 538.22] Okay.
[538.44 → 542.90] AMD is not sampling Frontier Edition.
[542.90 → 546.04] Why might they not?
[546.36 → 549.04] Oh, actually, you know what's hilarious is I didn't even read the article.
[549.68 → 555.96] Purchased directly from a reseller rather than being sampled from AMD.
[556.62 → 556.96] Um.
[557.38 → 560.24] So, why didn't they want to sample this to press?
[560.32 → 564.48] Well, there are a number of potential explanations for that.
[564.54 → 565.28] Can you think of any?
[566.12 → 567.98] Uh, well, they've been moving this way for a while.
[568.84 → 570.48] Uh, okay, that's true.
[570.62 → 571.84] On the professional cards.
[571.96 → 572.10] Yeah.
[572.28 → 574.04] The Fire, Fire Class cards.
[574.18 → 577.12] And actually, kind of both sides have been moving this way a little bit.
[577.24 → 580.16] NVIDIA has still been on their gaming cards, have been pushing really hard.
[580.30 → 585.44] But AMD, for a little while now, has been saying that they don't want to give out as many reviewer sample cards
[585.44 → 588.02] because they want to do more seeding into the community.
[588.02 → 591.02] And NVIDIA did not sample the Titan XPP.
[591.34 → 591.48] Yeah.
[591.68 → 594.58] We have a video coming featuring it soon, but we borrowed it from somebody.
[594.58 → 597.42] And they're trying to line this card up more against those.
[597.56 → 597.88] That's true.
[598.00 → 598.28] Okay.
[598.74 → 599.48] That's my main.
[599.50 → 601.42] Now, I'm going to contribute a potential reason.
[601.62 → 601.80] Okay.
[601.88 → 602.90] Potential reason number two.
[603.50 → 606.18] Yields are very low, and they don't have a lot of them.
[606.32 → 606.58] Yeah.
[606.82 → 607.16] Okay.
[607.30 → 608.20] So, that might be another one.
[608.22 → 608.76] You got another one?
[609.20 → 609.66] Um.
[611.12 → 612.36] I doubt this is a thing.
[612.50 → 612.80] Mm-hmm.
[612.98 → 613.98] But even maybe.
[614.48 → 618.42] Everyone is buying every single card everywhere for AMD right now because of mining.
[618.60 → 619.08] Ah, okay.
[619.24 → 619.36] Okay.
[619.36 → 621.40] So, they, like, know that it will sell immediately.
[621.58 → 622.24] So, price.
[622.52 → 622.64] Yeah.
[622.64 → 627.52] So, rather than giving away literally money in the bank, which when you're AMD.
[628.72 → 632.92] And, like, with their press right now, they might not even need reviews of this thing because
[632.92 → 636.08] everyone talking about AMD stuff is super popular right now.
[636.20 → 636.30] Yep.
[636.32 → 637.80] And very positive right now.
[637.88 → 638.02] Yep.
[638.02 → 640.02] So, it's going to be popular and positive anyway.
[640.02 → 642.62] And then everyone's buying it anyway because of mining.
[642.96 → 646.16] So, they might not even need the marketing that they would get from sending it.
[646.16 → 646.50] Okay.
[646.50 → 646.60] Okay.
[646.78 → 653.84] Which brings us, then, to reason number four, which I actually think might be the most likely.
[654.78 → 660.18] Vega does not look like it is going to set the world on fire.
[660.18 → 666.60] And AMD, and for that matter, I mean, who hasn't done this?
[666.60 → 676.66] But AMD has demonstrated in the past a lower level of eagerness to seed products that they
[676.66 → 685.92] don't think are going to be as exciting in an attempt to, if not limit independent coverage
[685.92 → 691.68] of them, at least not spend money on getting independent coverage of them.
[692.54 → 695.18] So, let's give a brief outline of what it is.
[695.22 → 698.58] So, the Vega Founders Edition is not explicitly aimed at gamers.
[700.06 → 701.10] Frontier Edition, sorry.
[701.26 → 703.08] I did that a lot on the announcement with you.
[703.56 → 704.46] Like, really, you guys?
[704.60 → 708.64] I actually might have another walk in the park coming on AMD's naming schemes because I'm getting
[708.64 → 709.30] real fed up.
[710.38 → 711.90] So, the Vega Frontier Edition.
[711.90 → 714.68] Let's just, like, almost sort of copy everyone else.
[714.82 → 715.00] Yeah.
[715.00 → 717.24] Not explicitly aimed at gamers.
[717.58 → 721.46] Like Nvidia Titans, we shouldn't expect the best performance per dollar.
[721.74 → 722.08] Okay.
[723.16 → 724.58] Gaming results, though.
[724.92 → 729.56] And this is, this is kind of, this kind of throws up some warning flags.
[730.02 → 739.52] Because with gaming results between a GTX 1070 and a 1080, priced at $1,000 for the 300-watt
[739.52 → 741.66] version, this tells us a couple of things.
[741.66 → 748.80] Number one is that, and that's the air-cooled one, and $1,500 for the 375-watt water-cooled
[748.80 → 748.96] one.
[749.08 → 754.74] That tells us we are pretty close to the limit of what this chip is capable of.
[754.74 → 759.12] And there isn't a lot of magic sauce.
[759.12 → 761.74] We did a video kind of covering this a little while ago.
[761.82 → 769.34] It was a holy Shiite episode that we did, where we were like, $6,000 graphics card.
[769.40 → 770.12] We game on it.
[770.12 → 780.26] The amount of R&D that goes into building a GPU is such that you should be very surprised
[780.26 → 786.64] if there is a specific product created for Squadron versus GeForce.
[786.70 → 787.38] Yeah.
[787.38 → 788.84] It's the same product.
[789.04 → 790.16] It's the same silicon.
[790.16 → 798.10] And in much the same way, AMD's Frontier Edition silicon will be the same silicon, give or take.
[798.22 → 801.10] It might be set up and utilized or whatever in different ways.
[801.20 → 802.68] And the memory paired with it might be different.
[803.10 → 803.82] Functional units here.
[804.00 → 804.32] Yeah.
[804.54 → 806.52] And the logic on board might be a little bit different.
[806.72 → 807.60] A tweak here and there.
[807.60 → 814.80] But the amount of money involved in building a GPU is incredible.
[815.52 → 828.96] So if you are expecting then the gaming versions of Vega to come in and crush the GTX 1080, let alone the 1080 Ti,
[829.30 → 833.50] you are setting yourself up for a major disappointment.
[833.50 → 837.96] And I'm sure that the AMD fans in Twitch chat are freaking out right now.
[838.02 → 840.60] I'm specifically not looking at it because I really don't care.
[841.04 → 845.02] I'm laying down some reality here and that's the way it's going to be.
[845.20 → 848.36] There is some driver optimization to be done.
[848.48 → 850.72] And AMD has been notorious for this.
[851.14 → 859.84] The 5870 is a perfect example of a product that managed to get faster enough through driver releases
[859.84 → 866.64] that when they rebadged it, it ended up being, it ended up not looking that bad when you looked at launch reviews
[866.64 → 870.78] of the rebadged one versus launch reviews of the original one.
[871.54 → 875.36] But you can't expect more than, it's not going to double in speed.
[875.90 → 877.66] Driver optimizations will give you a little bit.
[877.94 → 880.66] But the silicon is by and large not going to change.
[880.92 → 881.02] Yeah.
[881.02 → 887.26] The clock speed is by and large not going to change because it's a 300 watt part at 999.
[887.26 → 894.62] AMD's closest thing to a competitor is probably going to be somewhere in the neighbourhood of a GTX 1070 to 1080
[894.62 → 895.92] in terms of performance.
[896.58 → 902.22] So AMD may not have abandoned the high end, but it does look like,
[902.24 → 908.62] because they're not even talking about like a higher end Vega architecture product right now.
[908.84 → 909.26] Not at all.
[909.26 → 917.42] They do seem to have abandoned, whether by choice or whether by strategy, the enthusiast of the very extreme high end.
[918.00 → 922.00] I like using Rise of the Tomb Raider as a standard benchmark.
[922.16 → 922.96] We use it in a lot of different things.
[922.96 → 923.70] It scales really well.
[923.82 → 924.86] CPU and GPU.
[925.08 → 926.84] And multi-GPU even.
[926.84 → 934.62] And the Vega FE only managed to beat out the 1070 by about a 4 to 5% lead,
[935.12 → 939.60] which is at that price like really not great.
[940.68 → 941.76] So, um.
[941.94 → 943.08] It's not a gaming card.
[943.30 → 943.84] No, it's not.
[943.90 → 947.10] And we don't know anything about what pricing of Vega gaming,
[947.42 → 948.70] like what are they going to call it?
[948.74 → 949.82] R9 Vega or something?
[949.96 → 950.52] I don't know.
[950.58 → 951.52] I don't remember what they're going to call it.
[951.52 → 952.82] But, um.
[954.28 → 961.38] A lot of times you can get a rough idea of how it will perform in things that aren't gaming by using games.
[961.88 → 962.16] Yes.
[962.28 → 964.40] Because they're not completely unrelated.
[964.86 → 965.04] Yeah.
[965.34 → 969.70] But with that said, I believe, is it FP16 something?
[970.02 → 979.20] There's some more professional grade features that make it more comparable to Squadron than a straight gaming card would.
[979.30 → 979.42] Yeah.
[979.42 → 981.28] That will perform much better.
[981.28 → 985.90] And may make Vega Frontier Edition very interesting for workstation users.
[985.90 → 990.80] Because it will be similar in terms of performance to a P5000 Squadron,
[990.96 → 994.64] but at about half the price of that.
[995.44 → 1002.36] So at the very least, if you were wondering about buying like this crazy tiered AMD card for gaming,
[1002.52 → 1003.54] like maybe don't.
[1004.56 → 1005.98] Maybe that's what we know so far.
[1005.98 → 1011.66] Or at the very least, like wait until the gaming version of it arrives, and we can see kind of what we're dealing with here.
[1011.74 → 1018.24] Because even PC Purse conclusion is like title marked conclusion dot dot dot for now or something like that.
[1018.48 → 1019.20] So like, yeah.
[1019.20 → 1021.64] I don't think it's a huge deal.
[1024.10 → 1024.50] Yeah.
[1024.62 → 1028.04] Unless you were looking into this card as a gamer's perspective.
[1028.38 → 1029.60] But that's not what it is.
[1029.78 → 1030.08] No.
[1030.16 → 1031.34] And it's not how it's priced.
[1031.46 → 1031.66] Yeah.
[1031.66 → 1036.16] I am shocked that they had the guts to do a water-cooled card again.
[1036.98 → 1039.92] Like that looked like a desperation tactic last time.
[1040.70 → 1042.64] The Fury X was a commercial failure.
[1042.84 → 1043.92] Utter commercial failure.
[1045.06 → 1045.46] And...
[1045.46 → 1045.98] Could you buy...
[1045.98 → 1048.26] I don't think you could buy a Fury X air-cooled though, right?
[1048.62 → 1048.88] No.
[1048.88 → 1050.78] So this is a versioning thing.
[1051.08 → 1051.24] Yeah.
[1051.24 → 1052.30] They have an air-cooled one.
[1052.50 → 1054.04] It's a lot lower wattage.
[1054.16 → 1054.84] This is Fury and Fury X again.
[1054.92 → 1055.54] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[1058.08 → 1058.90] Yeah, that's fair.
[1061.16 → 1062.78] Yeah, we've got people in the chat.
[1062.86 → 1064.90] I'm finally looking at the chat.
[1065.00 → 1066.96] I've decided to subject myself to that.
[1067.92 → 1069.96] Hcore123 is like, AMD fans equal...
[1069.96 → 1072.82] NVIDIA fans.
[1072.90 → 1074.96] And then there's some emoji I can't see because it's too small.
[1075.10 → 1076.56] And yeah, I mean...
[1076.56 → 1077.12] The recent wars...
[1077.12 → 1078.96] I talked about this a little bit on the last show too.
[1079.04 → 1080.32] The recent wars have been kind of interesting
[1080.32 → 1081.86] because everything that people are fighting about
[1081.86 → 1084.00] are these like outside the tiers
[1084.00 → 1085.82] of what they're probably shopping for products.
[1086.08 → 1087.70] It is kind of a funny thing, isn't it?
[1087.70 → 1088.20] Which is so weird.
[1090.02 → 1092.06] The percentage of people that are actually interested
[1092.06 → 1094.12] in buying a $1,000 graphics card...
[1094.12 → 1095.90] Because if AMD can get this priced right,
[1096.36 → 1099.36] then, you know, yeah, it'll stomp all over a 1060.
[1099.96 → 1103.06] But if it consumes like 300 watts...
[1103.06 → 1103.62] Yeah.
[1104.28 → 1104.90] I don't know.
[1104.98 → 1106.12] Well, you know what?
[1106.20 → 1106.82] How about this?
[1107.52 → 1109.76] Why don't we cross that bridge when we get to it?
[1109.82 → 1111.94] In the meantime, that's what we know.
[1112.12 → 1115.10] For now, also, our Vega Frontier Edition is coming.
[1115.22 → 1116.82] So we're going to run all of our own numbers
[1116.82 → 1117.86] and make our own video.
[1118.10 → 1121.24] And you can probably save yourself the trouble of watching it
[1121.24 → 1122.28] by reading Shout's review.
[1122.28 → 1124.32] Am I allowed to say that?
[1124.76 → 1124.88] Yeah.
[1125.04 → 1126.60] I mean, who's going to fire me?
[1130.10 → 1130.98] Linus, you're fired.
[1131.76 → 1132.34] Damn it.
[1132.34 → 1132.90] Crap.
[1132.90 → 1133.08] Yeah.
[1133.08 → 1135.94] I'll have to go to my other job.
[1136.16 → 1136.40] Yeah.
[1136.40 → 1139.06] I'll have to go work for Float plane Club like you.
[1139.32 → 1139.70] Heck yeah.
[1139.88 → 1140.02] Yeah.
[1140.02 → 1140.72] Would you hire me?
[1141.08 → 1141.30] Yeah.
[1141.46 → 1141.84] Yes.
[1142.64 → 1142.96] Yeah.
[1143.04 → 1143.26] Yeah.
[1143.38 → 1143.64] I would.
[1143.78 → 1145.08] You'd be pretty expensive, but...
[1145.08 → 1145.48] All right.
[1145.58 → 1147.42] I feel like that investment would pay itself off.
[1147.60 → 1150.18] So the original article for our next news story is
[1150.18 → 1152.56] Overclock3D.net.
[1152.64 → 1158.36] AMD announces their new Ry zen Pro series of desktop CPUs.
[1158.36 → 1163.58] And I got to confess, I was a little bit confused initially
[1163.58 → 1168.36] by the announcement of Ry zen Pro because I kind of went,
[1168.54 → 1173.54] well, what makes a processor Pro other than being a processor?
[1177.30 → 1177.78] Nothing.
[1178.00 → 1179.46] I get nothing for processor.
[1179.86 → 1180.18] Sorry.
[1180.26 → 1181.18] I'm replying to something in the chat.
[1181.18 → 1181.74] I hate you.
[1183.34 → 1184.24] Can you...
[1184.24 → 1186.72] Can I pretend that that laugh was for my joke?
[1186.72 → 1190.40] The best part, too, is you made a joke and I didn't laugh
[1190.40 → 1192.80] because I was answering a question of someone going,
[1193.08 → 1193.66] really, Luke?
[1193.74 → 1194.46] Laughing again?
[1194.72 → 1195.42] Everything's funny?
[1196.10 → 1197.06] And I'm just like, you know what?
[1197.08 → 1198.48] I enjoy things.
[1198.94 → 1200.26] And I find things funny.
[1200.34 → 1203.80] Maybe we do WAN show at the end of the day on Friday
[1203.80 → 1206.34] so we can kind of loosen up a little bit.
[1206.38 → 1206.60] Yeah.
[1206.60 → 1209.30] Like, hang out for the first time this week
[1209.30 → 1211.24] because we almost never see each other.
[1211.38 → 1212.50] This week was pretty good.
[1213.10 → 1213.96] This week was pretty good.
[1214.08 → 1214.84] There were a few times.
[1215.10 → 1215.24] Yeah.
[1215.24 → 1217.32] Yeah, day Z underscore HK.
[1217.68 → 1217.92] Yeah.
[1218.68 → 1220.64] I just enjoy laughing at things.
[1220.84 → 1220.94] Yeah.
[1221.28 → 1221.78] You know what?
[1221.88 → 1223.32] Laughter is the best medicine.
[1223.48 → 1224.44] I even got called out by that.
[1224.44 → 1225.36] Unless you need chemotherapy,
[1225.70 → 1228.20] in which case chemotherapy is probably the best medicine.
[1228.36 → 1229.48] You might need to go do...
[1229.48 → 1229.80] Yes.
[1230.40 → 1232.62] So laughter is the best medicine for...
[1232.62 → 1233.62] If you're not actually sick.
[1233.64 → 1234.82] If you're not actually sick.
[1235.74 → 1236.18] Okay.
[1236.42 → 1236.82] Anyway.
[1237.34 → 1238.70] So I was sitting there going,
[1238.88 → 1240.94] what makes something a processor?
[1240.94 → 1243.62] And my...
[1243.62 → 1245.26] Got him.
[1246.22 → 1246.54] Jeez.
[1247.24 → 1248.12] That's rough.
[1248.20 → 1250.44] And my initial answer to that was the obvious one.
[1250.58 → 1251.58] ECC support.
[1252.00 → 1252.26] Okay.
[1252.38 → 1252.60] Yeah.
[1252.66 → 1252.90] Okay.
[1252.98 → 1253.18] Okay.
[1253.26 → 1257.44] So you can use server memory that has automatic error corrections
[1257.44 → 1260.32] that are going on the fly in case there's like,
[1260.38 → 1260.56] you know,
[1260.60 → 1262.80] a solar flare that flips a bit or whatever
[1262.80 → 1264.54] and you're freaking,
[1264.78 → 1265.02] you know,
[1265.12 → 1268.74] Free NAS ZFS array gets corrupted irreparably.
[1268.96 → 1269.00] Like,
[1269.62 → 1270.86] that's a pro-level feature.
[1271.00 → 1275.56] But the funny thing about that is that Ry zen has ECC support.
[1276.02 → 1278.60] They didn't fuse it off the way that Intel does
[1278.60 → 1280.76] on all of their consumer chips,
[1280.82 → 1282.62] even ones that cost $1,000,
[1282.98 → 1284.60] which I think is unreasonable
[1284.60 → 1286.54] because they're worried about,
[1286.54 → 1289.18] they're worried about cannibalizing their enterprise chips,
[1289.48 → 1290.02] their Eons.
[1290.02 → 1291.34] Um,
[1291.36 → 1294.38] so what they do though,
[1295.12 → 1296.96] and this didn't occur to me initially,
[1296.96 → 1300.56] is they offer Windows 10 Enterprise security support,
[1301.28 → 1303.72] AES 128-bit memory encryption,
[1304.08 → 1305.70] and a longer warranty.
[1306.10 → 1306.86] With that said,
[1306.90 → 1309.66] a 36-month warranty is what they used to offer anyway.
[1309.90 → 1310.42] But,
[1310.78 → 1311.84] hey,
[1312.00 → 1312.28] okay.
[1312.52 → 1312.72] I mean,
[1312.82 → 1313.10] Sure.
[1313.32 → 1314.80] It's also a processor.
[1315.06 → 1316.40] Whether it's AMD or Intel,
[1316.58 → 1318.40] they're both pretty good about their CPUs,
[1318.44 → 1319.12] not just like,
[1320.02 → 1321.58] randomly failing.
[1321.64 → 1322.92] How many times have you had a processor die?
[1323.02 → 1325.04] I had an Option 165 die.
[1325.78 → 1326.76] I deserved it.
[1328.04 → 1328.96] Was it your fault?
[1329.38 → 1330.54] I had it...
[1330.54 → 1332.78] How do I put this?
[1332.98 → 1333.28] Um...
[1333.28 → 1334.30] Yes, I'm going to take this as yes.
[1334.30 → 1334.58] No, hold on.
[1334.62 → 1336.62] No, I didn't like drop it on the floor.
[1336.72 → 1339.06] But you like overvoted the tar off of it?
[1339.18 → 1339.46] Just,
[1339.60 → 1340.46] can you just relax,
[1340.54 → 1340.76] okay?
[1340.86 → 1341.02] Yeah.
[1341.02 → 1341.58] Okay.
[1342.40 → 1342.84] So,
[1343.04 → 1345.76] I had it chilled to minus 25 degrees.
[1349.38 → 1349.80] Okay,
[1349.80 → 1350.80] I'm not going to finish the story.
[1351.00 → 1351.26] Okay.
[1354.26 → 1354.98] All right.
[1355.04 → 1355.36] All right.
[1355.48 → 1355.60] So,
[1355.68 → 1357.64] it was not really the processors.
[1357.64 → 1357.96] So,
[1358.04 → 1358.72] I had that coming.
[1359.04 → 1359.46] I'm not,
[1359.52 → 1359.90] I'm not...
[1359.90 → 1360.10] Okay.
[1360.10 → 1360.46] Yeah.
[1360.66 → 1360.98] So,
[1361.12 → 1362.14] zero so far.
[1362.28 → 1362.90] Do you have any more?
[1363.26 → 1363.64] Um,
[1363.74 → 1363.98] no.
[1364.28 → 1365.30] I'm also at zero.
[1365.80 → 1366.14] So,
[1366.22 → 1366.40] like,
[1366.48 → 1367.50] it's probably fine.
[1367.66 → 1369.22] The pro series will come...
[1369.22 → 1369.40] Okay,
[1369.48 → 1370.12] now to be clear,
[1370.18 → 1370.92] I have had like,
[1371.04 → 1372.16] test bench chips die.
[1372.72 → 1373.46] Was that the
[1373.46 → 1374.98] the old school chiller?
[1375.28 → 1375.62] Yes.
[1375.78 → 1376.00] Oh,
[1376.08 → 1376.74] that's pretty cool.
[1376.76 → 1377.26] That's the chiller.
[1377.32 → 1378.08] We haven't thrown it away.
[1378.16 → 1379.26] I might resurrect it someday,
[1379.36 → 1380.02] just for loss.
[1380.08 → 1380.92] You should do that as a video.
[1381.04 → 1381.64] It would be a great,
[1381.68 → 1381.94] actually,
[1382.02 → 1382.72] it would be a great video.
[1382.78 → 1383.42] That would be really fun.
[1383.42 → 1384.32] Alex to help you with it
[1384.32 → 1384.54] and like,
[1384.60 → 1385.56] modernize it a little bit.
[1385.74 → 1385.84] Yeah.
[1386.10 → 1387.28] Get it in a cooler box
[1387.28 → 1387.72] than just like...
[1387.72 → 1389.46] Get Proto Case to do something up for us?
[1389.48 → 1389.62] Yeah, yeah.
[1389.68 → 1390.00] Nice,
[1390.06 → 1390.88] I like this project.
[1391.08 → 1392.10] That would actually be really sick.
[1392.18 → 1393.16] And then we could use it
[1393.16 → 1394.46] like on our test benches and stuff.
[1394.48 → 1395.22] That would be really sick.
[1395.28 → 1396.84] We'd have to do up a new block for it
[1396.84 → 1398.62] because the block I used to use for it
[1398.62 → 1400.02] was a Danger Den TDX
[1400.02 → 1401.32] and that was out of pure cheapness.
[1401.36 → 1402.44] Maybe you can follow up
[1402.44 → 1402.86] the like,
[1402.96 → 1404.02] terrible heat sink guides
[1404.02 → 1405.62] with like a
[1405.98 → 1407.34] we professionally designed
[1407.34 → 1408.04] our own heat sink.
[1408.30 → 1409.50] Terrible chiller guide.
[1412.14 → 1412.50] I,
[1412.60 → 1413.26] I would love
[1413.26 → 1413.90] personally,
[1413.90 → 1414.92] I would love watching that.
[1415.06 → 1415.76] That would be great.
[1416.26 → 1417.92] So I was actually using
[1417.92 → 1419.28] highly not recommended.
[1419.88 → 1420.48] So with...
[1420.48 → 1421.14] People are asking for the story,
[1421.24 → 1421.64] but keep going.
[1421.66 → 1423.06] With antifreeze
[1423.06 → 1425.50] and water as coolant
[1425.50 → 1427.22] because once you're going down to...
[1427.22 → 1427.68] No, no, sorry.
[1427.76 → 1428.62] That's not what you use.
[1428.76 → 1430.06] You use a windshield de-ice.
[1430.78 → 1431.00] Okay.
[1431.00 → 1431.52] So that's actually
[1431.52 → 1433.20] like an alcohol-based coolant.
[1433.30 → 1433.44] Yeah.
[1433.66 → 1434.90] So I was using that
[1434.90 → 1438.90] at like sub 25 degrees.
[1438.90 → 1439.26] Actually,
[1439.32 → 1440.14] a little more than that
[1440.14 → 1440.98] on the actual coolant.
[1441.04 → 1441.82] It's about sub 35.
[1441.82 → 1443.28] I was using that
[1443.28 → 1444.70] in an acrylic block.
[1445.66 → 1446.06] Oh.
[1446.76 → 1448.10] So you leaked onto it?
[1448.10 → 1448.70] No, no, I didn't.
[1448.78 → 1449.14] I didn't.
[1449.24 → 1449.94] No, that survived.
[1450.10 → 1450.84] No, no, I'm just saying
[1450.84 → 1452.34] that that block still exists.
[1452.44 → 1453.18] We still have it.
[1453.38 → 1455.46] But it is so full of micro cracks
[1455.46 → 1457.06] around the fittings
[1457.06 → 1458.52] that it is terrifying.
[1458.64 → 1459.38] So I was using it
[1459.38 → 1460.56] out of cheapness because...
[1460.56 → 1460.86] I just assumed
[1460.86 → 1461.56] it would have cracked
[1461.56 → 1461.80] at that point.
[1461.80 → 1463.50] Whatever block I used
[1463.50 → 1465.54] in this contraption
[1465.54 → 1466.72] had to have like
[1466.72 → 1468.12] industrial glue put on it
[1468.12 → 1468.78] so that I could put
[1468.78 → 1469.72] all of my like
[1469.72 → 1471.18] neoprene insulation
[1471.18 → 1472.38] and crap all over it.
[1473.04 → 1474.28] And so it was basically
[1474.28 → 1474.94] a write-off.
[1475.24 → 1476.06] And that was at a time
[1476.06 → 1476.96] that so A,
[1477.12 → 1478.14] you're supposed to use
[1478.14 → 1478.94] an all metal block.
[1479.18 → 1479.38] Yeah.
[1479.50 → 1480.74] Preferably all the same metal.
[1481.00 → 1481.20] Yeah.
[1481.20 → 1482.40] So that the expansion
[1482.40 → 1482.96] and contraction
[1482.96 → 1484.08] of different metals.
[1484.50 → 1484.64] Yeah.
[1485.02 → 1486.10] So preferably
[1486.10 → 1486.86] you're supposed to do that.
[1486.92 → 1488.42] But those back then
[1488.42 → 1489.14] I would have been buying
[1489.14 → 1490.48] like a water cool
[1490.48 → 1491.54] I think it was called
[1491.54 → 1492.76] the Heat Killer 3.0
[1492.76 → 1493.52] or something like that
[1493.52 → 1494.34] or whatever it would have been
[1494.34 → 1494.84] at the time.
[1495.08 → 1495.52] Were those like
[1495.52 → 1496.70] crazy silver blocks?
[1496.70 → 1497.12] They were like 150 bucks.
[1497.50 → 1498.68] All just silver?
[1498.80 → 1500.24] Not, you could get silver ones
[1500.24 → 1501.34] but even the copper ones
[1501.34 → 1501.70] were like,
[1501.92 → 1503.32] they were like 80 or 90 euro
[1503.32 → 1504.72] or something stupid like that.
[1504.88 → 1507.02] So I was using
[1507.02 → 1508.06] like a crazy dumb thing.
[1508.12 → 1510.42] Anyway, if we use the partnerships
[1510.42 → 1511.56] that I now have
[1511.56 → 1512.86] with like protocase
[1512.86 → 1514.00] to do like a really nice
[1514.00 → 1515.04] enclosure for it
[1515.04 → 1516.12] and like get EK
[1516.12 → 1517.08] to build us something
[1517.08 → 1518.66] like custom or something for it.
[1518.66 → 1519.38] Oh, that'd be sick.
[1519.50 → 1520.88] That would be a sick project
[1520.88 → 1522.06] and something that we could like
[1522.06 → 1523.42] pull out with pride
[1523.42 → 1524.38] on the test bench
[1524.38 → 1525.10] when we want like,
[1525.22 → 1525.34] yeah.
[1525.34 → 1526.12] You know what?
[1526.26 → 1527.48] Because we have more resources now.
[1527.56 → 1528.18] We have more writers
[1528.18 → 1528.96] and all that kind of stuff.
[1529.32 → 1530.16] Something that I would love
[1530.16 → 1531.36] for us to do is
[1531.36 → 1533.02] back when it was just you and me
[1533.02 → 1534.60] we did some factory tours.
[1535.22 → 1535.58] Yes.
[1535.70 → 1536.52] We did Armour on.
[1536.64 → 1537.86] We did Sennheiser.
[1538.26 → 1538.94] We did,
[1538.94 → 1540.70] I feel like there was another one.
[1540.90 → 1541.68] Yeah, we did Cherry.
[1541.90 → 1542.18] Cherry.
[1542.28 → 1543.46] How could you forget Cherry?
[1543.60 → 1544.54] Like my favourite.
[1544.98 → 1546.14] That was where we popped
[1546.14 → 1547.48] our factory tour Cherry.
[1547.66 → 1548.36] Yeah, it was.
[1548.84 → 1549.32] It was great.
[1549.46 → 1550.44] I think I missed it
[1550.44 → 1551.28] because Sennheiser and Cherry
[1551.28 → 1552.08] were on the same trip.
[1552.08 → 1552.60] They were.
[1552.82 → 1552.90] Yeah.
[1554.26 → 1556.50] But now going through
[1556.50 → 1557.58] like maybe spending
[1557.58 → 1558.62] a couple of days there
[1558.62 → 1560.82] and like going through
[1560.82 → 1561.80] each station
[1561.80 → 1563.84] through like the design process
[1563.84 → 1564.84] of a water block.
[1565.60 → 1566.84] Go through like the guy
[1566.84 → 1568.52] that cads out the original files
[1568.52 → 1568.88] and like.
[1568.88 → 1569.08] You know what?
[1569.58 → 1571.54] We tried to do EK.
[1572.18 → 1572.50] Oh.
[1573.02 → 1574.54] We actually were thinking
[1574.54 → 1575.20] about doing it
[1575.20 → 1576.26] on the same trip
[1576.26 → 1577.64] as Cherry and Sennheiser.
[1577.98 → 1578.30] Oh.
[1578.50 → 1579.78] We couldn't get it worked out
[1579.78 → 1581.62] because the budget required
[1581.62 → 1582.94] for all the travel
[1582.94 → 1584.52] and because we do charge
[1584.52 → 1585.04] for those.
[1585.26 → 1586.12] That is a sponsored
[1586.12 → 1587.74] type of project for us.
[1588.58 → 1590.40] They couldn't make that work
[1590.40 → 1590.96] at the time.
[1591.36 → 1592.70] But now that they're going
[1592.70 → 1593.60] a little bit more mainstream
[1593.60 → 1594.82] and actually that might work.
[1595.28 → 1596.36] We'll talk a little bit more
[1596.36 → 1597.20] about that when we do
[1597.20 → 1599.06] our ad spot for WAN show today.
[1599.16 → 1599.96] That's the EK spot.
[1600.18 → 1600.28] Yeah.
[1600.36 → 1601.54] Maybe we could make it work
[1601.54 → 1602.32] because I would love
[1602.32 → 1602.96] to see their shop.
[1602.96 → 1603.66] That would be super cool.
[1603.92 → 1605.46] Their shop is sick.
[1605.66 → 1605.92] Yeah.
[1606.22 → 1606.96] And like if you can
[1606.96 → 1608.02] actually see like
[1608.02 → 1610.12] what goes into designing
[1610.12 → 1611.06] and building a product.
[1611.16 → 1612.24] And EK actually
[1612.24 → 1613.62] manufactures everything.
[1613.96 → 1614.98] So they're not like
[1614.98 → 1616.86] all water cooling companies
[1616.86 → 1618.64] that are designing somewhere
[1618.64 → 1619.72] and then outsourcing
[1619.72 → 1620.28] to China.
[1620.52 → 1620.68] Yeah.
[1621.00 → 1622.14] EK actually owns
[1622.14 → 1623.42] their own manufacturing.
[1623.74 → 1624.90] So it would be
[1624.90 → 1625.58] pretty cool to see that.
[1625.58 → 1626.18] That would be pretty sick.
[1627.58 → 1628.02] Okay.
[1628.16 → 1629.18] What else do we got?
[1629.20 → 1629.58] Okay.
[1629.68 → 1630.36] Ry zen Pro.
[1631.78 → 1632.22] Right.
[1632.32 → 1633.44] We were talking about that.
[1633.76 → 1634.04] Okay.
[1634.12 → 1634.90] Ry zen Pro offers
[1634.90 → 1635.66] yet another advantage
[1635.66 → 1637.18] over Intel's i3 series
[1637.18 → 1638.14] especially because
[1638.14 → 1640.58] those lack Intel pro.
[1641.40 → 1643.20] So basically AMD
[1643.20 → 1644.32] is putting more pressure
[1644.32 → 1644.80] on Intel.
[1645.22 → 1645.86] And this time
[1645.86 → 1646.54] it's on the
[1646.54 → 1647.62] like professional
[1647.62 → 1648.84] and business feature side
[1648.84 → 1649.56] which is definitely
[1649.56 → 1650.42] something that I can
[1650.42 → 1651.44] appreciate because
[1651.44 → 1652.60] I mean you were talking
[1652.60 → 1653.58] about this the other day.
[1653.58 → 1655.58] security and encryption
[1655.58 → 1657.28] is going to become
[1657.28 → 1658.10] one of those things
[1658.10 → 1659.12] where like we might be
[1659.12 → 1660.24] sitting in a golden age
[1660.24 → 1661.32] of hardware right now
[1661.32 → 1663.78] where manufacturers
[1663.78 → 1664.70] are waking up
[1664.70 → 1666.06] to the need
[1666.06 → 1666.74] for encryption
[1666.74 → 1667.34] on their devices.
[1667.52 → 1668.80] Apple has to a great extent.
[1668.98 → 1669.04] Yeah.
[1669.44 → 1670.68] And governments
[1670.68 → 1672.90] haven't outlawed it yet.
[1673.18 → 1673.40] Yeah.
[1673.80 → 1675.08] So think about this.
[1676.00 → 1677.82] Like 10 years from now
[1677.82 → 1678.96] getting your hands
[1678.96 → 1680.14] on a Ry zen Pro
[1680.14 → 1682.68] might be like a thing.
[1682.68 → 1683.14] Yeah.
[1683.32 → 1684.44] For your like encrypted
[1684.44 → 1684.88] computer.
[1685.00 → 1685.72] If you want encrypted
[1685.72 → 1686.18] memory.
[1686.34 → 1686.58] Yeah.
[1688.16 → 1689.38] Think about that for a minute.
[1689.46 → 1690.16] Like I'm not trying to go
[1690.16 → 1690.96] all tinfoil hat
[1690.96 → 1691.92] but it's no secret
[1691.92 → 1692.70] that governments
[1692.70 → 1693.58] around the world
[1693.58 → 1694.00] are...
[1694.00 → 1694.62] There are articles
[1694.62 → 1695.50] in this WAN show
[1695.50 → 1696.08] that we haven't talked
[1696.08 → 1696.40] about yet
[1696.40 → 1697.14] that are exactly
[1697.14 → 1698.06] in line with this.
[1699.08 → 1699.48] Yeah.
[1699.56 → 1700.00] It's going to be
[1700.00 → 1701.34] an interesting time.
[1703.64 → 1703.96] AMD
[1703.96 → 1705.98] accidentally reveals
[1705.98 → 1707.46] Ry zen 3 details.
[1707.80 → 1708.34] Wah.
[1708.62 → 1709.18] Is this like a
[1709.18 → 1710.18] quote unquote accidentally
[1710.18 → 1710.70] or is this
[1710.70 → 1711.66] legitimately accidental?
[1711.78 → 1712.44] I can never tell
[1712.44 → 1713.10] with those guys
[1713.10 → 1714.00] to be honest with you.
[1714.08 → 1714.92] Sometimes I suspect
[1714.92 → 1715.72] that it's
[1715.72 → 1716.80] quote unquote accidentally.
[1717.12 → 1718.34] Other times I believe
[1718.34 → 1719.20] them that it's not
[1719.20 → 1719.52] accident.
[1719.60 → 1720.02] I don't know.
[1720.56 → 1721.00] Anyway.

[1725.34 → 1725.82] Well gee.
[1725.96 → 1726.50] If you were paying
[1726.50 → 1727.04] close attention
[1727.04 → 1727.66] to this morning's
[1727.66 → 1728.14] announcement of
[1728.14 → 1729.12] AMD's new Ry zen Pro
[1729.12 → 1729.46] SKUs
[1729.46 → 1729.98] then you likely
[1729.98 → 1730.52] noticed something
[1730.52 → 1731.10] interesting.
[1731.42 → 1732.82] The non-X Pro
[1732.82 → 1733.52] chips all have
[1733.52 → 1734.14] the same performance
[1734.14 → 1734.68] specifications
[1734.68 → 1735.34] as their standard
[1735.34 → 1736.12] consumer counterparts.
[1736.96 → 1737.32] Specifically
[1737.32 → 1738.50] both of the non-X Pro
[1738.50 → 1739.30] SKUs with existing
[1739.30 → 1739.96] Ry zen 5 and 7
[1739.96 → 1740.42] counterparts have
[1740.42 → 1740.82] the same core
[1740.82 → 1741.00] counts,
[1741.08 → 1741.22] clocks,
[1741.30 → 1741.40] speeds,
[1741.48 → 1742.16] and TDPs.
[1742.72 → 1743.58] As for the final
[1743.58 → 1744.28] two Ry zen Pro
[1744.28 → 1744.70] 3 SKUs
[1744.70 → 1745.00] well they
[1745.00 → 1745.44] inadvertently
[1745.44 → 1745.86] showed their
[1745.86 → 1746.54] hand when it
[1746.54 → 1747.02] comes to the
[1747.02 → 1748.06] forthcoming Ry zen
[1748.06 → 1748.80] 3.
[1749.50 → 1749.90] Okay.
[1750.74 → 1751.54] So I mean we
[1751.54 → 1752.20] are making some
[1752.20 → 1753.06] assumptions here
[1753.06 → 1753.88] but it looks
[1753.88 → 1755.78] like they've
[1755.78 → 1756.38] inadvertently
[1756.38 → 1756.98] revealed the
[1756.98 → 1757.58] Ry zen 3
[1757.58 → 1758.58] 1300 and
[1758.58 → 1759.90] 1200 specs.
[1760.62 → 1761.54] So the Ry zen 3
[1761.54 → 1762.44] looks like it'll
[1762.44 → 1763.42] be a quad-core
[1763.42 → 1764.68] CPU without
[1764.68 → 1765.30] SMT.
[1765.88 → 1766.82] So that's four
[1766.82 → 1767.92] threads rather than
[1767.92 → 1768.12] eight.
[1768.12 → 1769.62] which in my
[1769.62 → 1771.06] opinion is what
[1771.06 → 1772.10] entry level chips
[1772.10 → 1773.14] should have been at
[1773.14 → 1774.16] this point for a
[1774.16 → 1774.84] few years now.
[1776.48 → 1777.38] Give me one quick
[1777.38 → 1777.60] second.
[1777.76 → 1777.88] Sorry.
[1778.44 → 1778.78] You're good.
[1778.88 → 1779.38] Everything's fine.
[1779.64 → 1780.18] Don't worry about it.
[1780.86 → 1781.36] Everything's okay.
[1781.42 → 1782.20] Is everything okay?
[1782.28 → 1782.70] Yeah it is.
[1784.02 → 1785.06] Does everything seem
[1785.06 → 1785.86] okay to you guys?
[1786.78 → 1787.52] Tell you what.
[1787.62 → 1788.22] Why don't we talk
[1788.22 → 1789.28] about Ry zen 3 later?
[1789.36 → 1790.00] Why don't I just do
[1790.00 → 1790.90] the sponsor spots?
[1790.90 → 1793.66] So boom.
[1794.06 → 1794.92] FreshBooks.
[1795.60 → 1796.28] Oh right.
[1796.38 → 1797.22] I have notes.
[1798.22 → 1798.90] I always go off
[1798.90 → 1799.54] script and I always
[1799.54 → 1800.00] get in trouble.
[1800.12 → 1801.10] So FreshBooks is
[1801.10 → 1802.12] the super simple
[1802.12 → 1803.44] to use invoicing
[1803.44 → 1804.66] tool that actually
[1804.66 → 1806.44] does a lot more
[1806.44 → 1807.58] than just help you
[1807.58 → 1808.70] create and send
[1808.70 → 1810.08] slick looking
[1810.08 → 1810.76] invoices.
[1811.12 → 1812.08] You can keep track
[1812.08 → 1813.00] of your time with
[1813.00 → 1813.66] their timesheet
[1813.66 → 1814.60] function, manage
[1814.60 → 1815.38] your expenses,
[1815.78 → 1816.98] and keep track
[1816.98 → 1818.54] of who owes you
[1818.54 → 1819.44] money, even going
[1819.44 → 1820.46] as far as to be
[1820.46 → 1821.42] able to tell you
[1821.42 → 1822.66] once your client
[1822.66 → 1823.40] has looked at
[1823.40 → 1823.96] your invoice
[1823.96 → 1825.10] for the first time.
[1825.46 → 1826.18] What's really neat
[1826.18 → 1827.08] is their mobile app
[1827.08 → 1827.86] has all the
[1827.86 → 1828.50] functionality of
[1828.50 → 1829.32] the desktop version
[1829.32 → 1830.50] so you can take
[1830.50 → 1831.68] FreshBooks with you
[1831.68 → 1833.64] wherever you go.
[1833.70 → 1834.22] And if you have
[1834.22 → 1835.10] any questions about
[1835.10 → 1835.90] FreshBooks or how
[1835.90 → 1836.90] to use it, you can
[1836.90 → 1837.54] reach out to their
[1837.54 → 1838.54] support staff where
[1838.54 → 1839.46] you literally call
[1839.46 → 1840.98] them and someone
[1840.98 → 1841.68] like a person
[1841.68 → 1842.34] picks up the phone
[1842.34 → 1842.62] and is like,
[1843.16 → 1843.40] hello.
[1844.72 → 1845.76] No one is available
[1845.76 → 1846.68] to take your call.
[1846.98 → 1847.54] Please leave it.
[1847.56 → 1848.06] No, I'm just kidding.
[1848.10 → 1848.72] Not that other part.
[1848.80 → 1849.52] They pick up the phone
[1849.52 → 1850.08] and they say hello
[1850.08 → 1850.80] and you can actually
[1850.80 → 1851.28] talk to them.
[1851.34 → 1852.06] No escalations,
[1852.14 → 1852.58] phone trees,
[1852.90 → 1853.60] return calls,
[1853.82 → 1854.66] just answers.
[1855.00 → 1855.32] So visit
[1855.32 → 1856.32] freshbooks.com
[1856.32 → 1857.00] slash when.
[1857.18 → 1857.98] If you're a small
[1857.98 → 1858.82] business owner
[1858.82 → 1862.82] or a freelancer
[1862.82 → 1863.84] and you want to
[1863.84 → 1864.38] start spending
[1864.38 → 1865.36] your time
[1865.36 → 1866.40] working,
[1866.68 → 1867.20] instead of
[1867.20 → 1867.94] spending your time
[1867.94 → 1869.16] working out
[1869.16 → 1869.70] how to use
[1869.70 → 1870.72] complicated accounting
[1870.72 → 1871.22] software.
[1871.90 → 1873.36] Also, FreshBooks
[1873.36 → 1874.28] is our title
[1874.28 → 1876.72] sponsor for LTX.
[1876.72 → 1877.94] Linus Tech
[1877.94 → 1879.50] Expo 2017.
[1879.88 → 1880.24] Where you can
[1880.24 → 1880.80] see this.
[1882.54 → 1883.30] Oh, I wasn't
[1883.30 → 1883.86] going to acknowledge
[1883.86 → 1884.04] it.
[1884.10 → 1884.50] Everyone's been
[1884.50 → 1885.06] talking about it
[1885.06 → 1885.48] in the chat
[1885.48 → 1885.88] and I was just
[1885.88 → 1886.74] going to completely
[1886.74 → 1887.30] ignore them.
[1887.30 → 1887.70] It was also just
[1887.70 → 1890.26] you are also
[1890.26 → 1890.58] here.
[1891.46 → 1891.94] Oh.
[1892.90 → 1893.72] Yeah, fine.
[1893.78 → 1894.30] We'll acknowledge
[1894.30 → 1894.60] it.
[1894.94 → 1895.60] So that'll be
[1895.60 → 1897.20] there, but I'm
[1897.20 → 1897.70] not going to tell
[1897.70 → 1898.40] you any more
[1898.40 → 1898.94] about it.
[1899.32 → 1900.38] Other than that,
[1900.44 → 1901.76] that might be a
[1901.76 → 1902.38] Linus Tech Tips
[1902.38 → 1902.72] logo.
[1902.72 → 1903.28] There.
[1905.40 → 1906.34] Yeah, that's all
[1906.34 → 1906.64] we'll say.
[1906.70 → 1907.14] That's all we'll
[1907.14 → 1907.64] say about it.
[1907.72 → 1908.16] So that'll be
[1908.16 → 1908.44] there.
[1908.92 → 1909.84] We're probably,
[1910.18 → 1910.90] hopefully, going
[1910.90 → 1912.24] to have, okay,
[1912.42 → 1913.16] I'm kind of tipping
[1913.16 → 1913.82] my hand a little
[1913.82 → 1914.38] bit here, but
[1914.38 → 1915.08] LTX is going to
[1915.08 → 1915.52] be freaking
[1915.52 → 1915.84] sick.
[1916.78 → 1917.34] We're going to
[1917.34 → 1918.76] have 16k gaming
[1918.76 → 1919.12] there.
[1919.42 → 1919.58] Ooh.
[1920.68 → 1921.58] The case toss,
[1921.66 → 1922.22] okay, I don't
[1922.22 → 1924.04] know, it's on
[1924.04 → 1924.56] Float plane right
[1924.56 → 1924.78] now.
[1925.12 → 1925.54] Yeah, it's
[1925.54 → 1925.94] Channel Super
[1925.94 → 1926.54] Fun on Float plane
[1926.54 → 1926.72] right now.
[1926.72 → 1927.76] Yeah, it's not on
[1927.76 → 1928.08] Channel Super
[1928.08 → 1928.48] Fun on YouTube,
[1928.48 → 1929.42] but we did
[1929.42 → 1930.38] like a case
[1930.38 → 1931.32] toss to show
[1931.32 → 1931.66] what it might
[1931.66 → 1932.36] be like while
[1932.36 → 1933.04] you're at LTX.
[1933.08 → 1933.52] It was actually
[1933.52 → 1934.20] tons of fun.
[1934.34 → 1934.52] Yep.
[1935.16 → 1935.76] There's going to
[1935.76 → 1936.38] be other
[1936.38 → 1937.12] examples of
[1937.12 → 1938.14] booths, there's
[1938.14 → 1938.36] going to be
[1938.36 → 1938.94] other types of
[1938.94 → 1939.44] booths like
[1939.44 → 1940.10] guess how many
[1940.10 → 1940.90] CPUs are in
[1940.90 → 1941.42] a jar, kind
[1941.42 → 1941.72] of like the
[1941.72 → 1942.26] old Jellybean
[1942.26 → 1942.90] thing, Rocket
[1942.90 → 1943.26] League in
[1943.26 → 1943.78] real life,
[1944.20 → 1945.00] video editing
[1945.00 → 1945.50] tips from
[1945.50 → 1945.80] Taken.
[1945.94 → 1946.54] We're literally
[1946.54 → 1947.00] going to take
[1947.00 → 1947.74] his workstation
[1947.74 → 1950.10] and transplant
[1950.10 → 1951.02] it over there
[1951.02 → 1951.70] and let him
[1951.70 → 1952.30] keep working.
[1952.44 → 1952.56] Yep.
[1953.18 → 1953.72] And he'll
[1953.72 → 1954.44] be talking to
[1954.44 → 1954.82] people about
[1954.82 → 1955.08] what he's
[1955.08 → 1955.32] doing.
[1955.70 → 1955.94] So it's
[1955.94 → 1956.80] July 29th
[1956.80 → 1957.56] from 11am to
[1957.56 → 1958.20] 5pm and
[1958.20 → 1958.58] you can get
[1958.58 → 1958.96] your ticket
[1958.96 → 1959.40] through the
[1959.40 → 1960.34] forum or
[1960.34 → 1960.98] at the link
[1960.98 → 1961.64] in the video
[1961.64 → 1962.06] description,
[1962.26 → 1962.50] which I'm
[1962.50 → 1962.74] going to go
[1962.74 → 1963.14] ahead and
[1963.14 → 1963.62] drop in the
[1963.62 → 1964.10] Twitch chat
[1964.10 → 1964.62] right now.
[1964.86 → 1965.26] Twitch Plays
[1965.26 → 1966.18] Pokémon was
[1966.18 → 1966.56] like, are we
[1966.56 → 1967.10] just skipping
[1967.10 → 1967.56] 8k?
[1968.10 → 1968.52] Yes.
[1968.86 → 1969.30] Yes.
[1970.58 → 1971.76] Okay, other
[1971.76 → 1972.92] sponsor, EK
[1972.92 → 1973.60] Water blocks.
[1974.38 → 1974.96] Heck yeah.
[1975.36 → 1976.14] So this, my
[1976.14 → 1977.16] friends, is
[1977.16 → 1978.62] EK's foray
[1978.62 → 1979.68] into the
[1979.68 → 1981.16] mainstream, but
[1981.16 → 1981.88] unlike their
[1981.88 → 1983.28] previous Predator
[1983.28 → 1984.34] lineup of
[1984.34 → 1986.02] thank you,
[1986.48 → 1987.24] trying to make
[1987.24 → 1987.92] water cooling
[1987.92 → 1988.58] more mainstream,
[1988.78 → 1989.22] like trying to
[1989.22 → 1989.92] be more like
[1989.92 → 1990.84] an AIO, but
[1990.84 → 1991.56] better, like
[1991.56 → 1993.26] expandable, this
[1993.26 → 1995.16] one is much,
[1995.44 → 1996.08] much less
[1996.08 → 1996.92] expensive.
[1997.88 → 1998.74] So what they've
[1998.74 → 1999.76] done, and this
[1999.76 → 2001.06] sounds crazy on
[2001.06 → 2001.74] first glance, but
[2001.74 → 2002.58] we actually have a
[2002.58 → 2003.84] review, which by
[2003.84 → 2004.34] the way, we
[2004.34 → 2005.36] completed, it's not
[2005.36 → 2006.14] uploaded yet, but
[2006.14 → 2006.90] we completed, we
[2006.90 → 2007.78] evaluated this thing
[2007.78 → 2008.48] before we did any
[2008.48 → 2009.36] sponsor spots for
[2009.36 → 2009.50] it.
[2009.68 → 2010.70] We have a review
[2010.70 → 2013.64] coming, and it's
[2013.64 → 2014.28] pretty positive.
[2014.28 → 2015.28] positive.
[2015.28 → 2015.44] This thing is
[2015.44 → 2016.08] perfect.
[2017.14 → 2018.22] By making all
[2018.22 → 2018.98] the blocks out of
[2018.98 → 2019.96] aluminum instead of
[2019.96 → 2021.48] copper, they have
[2021.48 → 2023.32] lowered the cost, they
[2023.32 → 2024.08] have lowered the
[2024.08 → 2025.10] machining time, which
[2025.10 → 2026.26] inherently lowers the
[2026.26 → 2027.48] cost, they have
[2027.48 → 2028.26] retained the
[2028.26 → 2031.08] expandability, and
[2031.08 → 2033.00] they have retained
[2033.00 → 2034.50] most of the
[2034.50 → 2035.78] performance of a
[2035.78 → 2036.90] full copper custom
[2036.90 → 2037.22] loop.
[2037.62 → 2038.88] The drawback is that
[2038.88 → 2041.00] you can't mix EK's
[2041.00 → 2042.20] A-series products
[2042.20 → 2042.88] with their normal
[2042.88 → 2043.78] products, because
[2043.78 → 2044.52] there would be a
[2044.52 → 2045.28] risk of galvanic
[2045.28 → 2045.68] corrosion.
[2046.22 → 2046.70] I don't know why
[2046.70 → 2048.46] Siri started taking
[2048.46 → 2048.88] off there.
[2049.68 → 2051.24] But the point is,
[2051.68 → 2053.00] the A120, the
[2053.00 → 2054.30] A240, and the
[2054.30 → 2056.78] A240G, especially
[2056.78 → 2058.40] personally, I don't
[2058.40 → 2059.38] think this is in my
[2059.38 → 2062.22] sponsor notes, but
[2062.22 → 2064.48] especially the A240
[2064.48 → 2066.28] and the A240G look
[2066.28 → 2067.62] like a fantastic
[2067.62 → 2069.92] value for custom
[2069.92 → 2070.44] liquid cooling.
[2070.44 → 2071.68] The G, does that
[2071.68 → 2072.20] mean it includes
[2072.20 → 2072.92] graphics cards?
[2072.94 → 2073.32] It does.
[2073.42 → 2074.10] It includes a
[2074.10 → 2077.26] 1060 to Titan XP
[2077.26 → 2078.60] Founder's Edition
[2078.60 → 2079.60] compatible block.
[2079.74 → 2080.10] Cool.
[2080.84 → 2081.90] So, looks pretty
[2081.90 → 2082.34] darn good.
[2082.42 → 2083.22] And unlike other
[2083.22 → 2084.58] AIDS, it includes
[2084.58 → 2086.16] actual fittings, it
[2086.16 → 2087.16] includes tubing that
[2087.16 → 2087.80] you can change out
[2087.80 → 2088.58] for something else,
[2088.92 → 2090.20] it includes Vardar
[2090.20 → 2091.84] fans, so very good
[2091.84 → 2093.22] fans, and it
[2093.22 → 2097.88] includes a custom
[2097.88 → 2099.26] grade pump and
[2099.26 → 2100.24] then tube reservoir
[2100.24 → 2100.76] combo.
[2100.88 → 2101.16] Nice.
[2101.32 → 2101.84] That's cool.
[2102.20 → 2103.32] So, looking pretty
[2103.32 → 2103.56] good.
[2103.66 → 2104.40] So, you can check
[2104.40 → 2105.28] that out over at
[2105.28 → 2108.12] geni.us slash
[2108.12 → 2109.52] ekfluidgaming.
[2109.60 → 2110.20] I'll drop that in the
[2110.20 → 2110.90] Twitch chat as well.
[2113.00 → 2113.40] Okay.
[2113.74 → 2114.54] All right.
[2114.70 → 2114.98] Yeah, I know.
[2114.98 → 2116.50] I got the notification
[2116.50 → 2118.46] from Tyler that he was
[2118.46 → 2119.46] clearing the fridge out
[2119.46 → 2120.78] in 15 minutes.
[2121.00 → 2121.22] Oh.
[2121.32 → 2122.80] And I got it 21 minutes
[2122.80 → 2123.12] ago.
[2123.18 → 2124.16] Oh, and he was going to
[2124.16 → 2124.94] throw away your food?
[2125.14 → 2126.30] Which I, like, don't even
[2126.30 → 2127.74] normally store food here
[2127.74 → 2128.42] because I just have, like,
[2128.54 → 2129.34] Solent, which you don't
[2129.34 → 2130.68] throw out, which I have for,
[2130.76 → 2131.62] like, breakfast and stuff,
[2131.62 → 2133.44] but there's, I had a bunch of
[2133.44 → 2134.88] food here that my girlfriend
[2134.88 → 2136.90] cooked, and she's the least
[2136.90 → 2138.20] domestic person ever and
[2138.20 → 2139.42] doesn't cook, but she's very
[2139.42 → 2140.44] excited about this stuff
[2140.44 → 2140.80] right now.
[2140.90 → 2141.72] So, if it all got thrown
[2141.72 → 2143.04] out, that would have been a
[2143.04 → 2143.76] very bad.
[2144.48 → 2144.84] Right.
[2145.26 → 2145.92] Yeah, that would have been
[2145.92 → 2146.16] bad.
[2146.22 → 2146.78] Bad scene.
[2146.88 → 2148.16] So, I solved that.
[2148.44 → 2148.76] Good.
[2148.96 → 2149.60] Everything's fine.
[2149.68 → 2150.76] So, you solved that by
[2150.76 → 2151.92] fishing it out of the garbage
[2151.92 → 2152.92] can, putting it back in the
[2152.92 → 2154.10] container and not telling her?
[2154.10 → 2159.26] I think in Tyler's regular
[2159.26 → 2160.60] style, he said 15 minutes
[2160.60 → 2161.30] and it's probably, like,
[2161.32 → 2161.76] half an hour.
[2161.96 → 2162.22] Okay.
[2162.28 → 2163.34] So, it just wasn't done yet.
[2163.44 → 2163.76] Okay.
[2164.38 → 2165.62] We've got people asking why
[2165.62 → 2166.42] I'm using an iPhone.
[2166.78 → 2167.74] To be clear, what I mean by
[2167.74 → 2168.78] that is he gave people a
[2168.78 → 2169.82] grace period, not that he's
[2169.82 → 2170.08] delayed.
[2170.34 → 2171.80] I'm using an iPhone because
[2171.80 → 2173.64] I actually don't really care
[2173.64 → 2177.14] right now between Android
[2177.14 → 2179.88] and iOS, and I had to give
[2179.88 → 2182.34] the shooters my S8, which I
[2182.34 → 2183.30] was using as my daily
[2183.30 → 2185.76] driver, to do comparative
[2185.76 → 2187.00] B-roll against the OnePlus
[2187.00 → 2187.58] 5.
[2188.34 → 2189.44] And then I just haven't
[2189.44 → 2190.24] gotten around to putting my
[2190.24 → 2191.06] SIM back in the S8.
[2191.10 → 2192.02] I do intend to go back to
[2192.02 → 2192.46] the S8.
[2192.68 → 2193.66] How do you feel about the
[2193.66 → 2194.08] notifications?
[2194.80 → 2196.10] They're both awful in
[2196.10 → 2196.74] different ways.
[2196.88 → 2197.12] Okay.
[2197.48 → 2198.12] Because that was, like,
[2198.16 → 2199.12] one thing that I hated
[2199.12 → 2200.42] about iOS when I used it
[2200.42 → 2201.48] for a fairly short period
[2201.48 → 2202.24] of time was the
[2202.24 → 2202.72] notifications.
[2202.88 → 2203.04] Yeah.
[2203.14 → 2204.06] The problem is that
[2204.06 → 2205.68] Samsung in the I think
[2205.68 → 2206.40] it was the Marshmallow
[2206.40 → 2208.80] update, LM Nougat update.
[2209.68 → 2211.84] So, Samsung, even when you
[2211.84 → 2213.12] set your privacy settings,
[2213.12 → 2213.76] people in the chat,
[2213.84 → 2214.36] IEEE!
[2216.82 → 2217.96] Even when you set your
[2217.96 → 2219.96] privacy settings to show
[2219.96 → 2221.68] your notifications on your
[2221.68 → 2223.06] lock screen before you log
[2223.06 → 2225.26] in, they changed it so that
[2225.26 → 2227.92] Gmail notifications don't
[2227.92 → 2228.62] show anymore.
[2230.70 → 2232.62] So, I actually have to unlock
[2232.62 → 2233.20] the phone.
[2233.46 → 2234.58] Like, I can see I have Gmail
[2234.58 → 2235.56] notifications, but I can't
[2235.56 → 2236.38] see what they are.
[2236.50 → 2237.00] Okay, yeah.
[2237.46 → 2238.28] Well, you should have your
[2238.28 → 2239.22] phone encrypted so it doesn't
[2239.22 → 2240.20] show what they are anyway.
[2240.20 → 2243.32] No, I think, yeah, no, it's
[2243.32 → 2243.62] encrypted.
[2244.32 → 2245.92] But you should make it so
[2245.92 → 2246.60] that it doesn't show
[2246.60 → 2246.72] anyway.
[2246.72 → 2247.92] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
[2247.92 → 2248.14] yeah, yeah.
[2248.14 → 2248.98] That was, like, in the
[2248.98 → 2249.58] security meeting.
[2249.60 → 2250.14] Should, should, should, should,
[2250.14 → 2250.66] should, should, should.
[2250.72 → 2252.20] But the point is I get too
[2252.20 → 2253.50] many notifications for that.
[2253.50 → 2253.74] Yeah.
[2253.88 → 2255.40] To be perfectly frank with
[2255.40 → 2255.58] you.
[2255.66 → 2256.84] If certain emails come
[2256.84 → 2257.64] through, you can get super
[2257.64 → 2257.94] screwed.
[2259.30 → 2260.00] Yeah, I guess that's
[2260.00 → 2260.38] possible.
[2260.38 → 2261.68] Does it just show the
[2261.68 → 2261.94] subject?
[2262.04 → 2262.92] Yeah, just subject line.
[2263.04 → 2263.28] That's it?
[2263.28 → 2264.32] Maybe the first few words,
[2264.42 → 2265.18] but there's not much.
[2265.64 → 2266.82] There are some emails that can,
[2266.94 → 2267.96] you can get screwed for the
[2267.96 → 2268.02] first few words.
[2268.02 → 2269.34] I don't get any, like,
[2269.42 → 2270.60] two-factor emails, though,
[2271.16 → 2271.66] like that.
[2272.76 → 2273.78] Because I think that's the
[2273.78 → 2274.54] kind you're thinking of.
[2274.56 → 2274.78] Mostly.
[2275.00 → 2275.40] Yeah, no.
[2275.40 → 2276.04] Yeah, okay.
[2276.08 → 2276.22] No.
[2276.36 → 2276.58] Okay.
[2277.10 → 2278.60] So, so yeah, it's really
[2278.60 → 2281.14] frustrating, and, yeah.
[2281.22 → 2282.40] So anyway, I just haven't put my
[2282.40 → 2283.90] SIM back in the S8 yet, and I
[2283.90 → 2285.06] actually own two smart
[2285.06 → 2285.34] watches.
[2285.64 → 2287.44] They both sit on my bedside
[2287.44 → 2289.56] table on their chargers, and
[2289.56 → 2290.74] whichever phone I happen to
[2290.74 → 2292.50] be using, I just grab either an
[2292.50 → 2294.78] Android Wear, or an Apple
[2294.78 → 2295.10] Watch.
[2296.10 → 2296.54] Wow.
[2296.72 → 2296.96] Yep.
[2299.66 → 2300.06] Okay.
[2300.06 → 2302.34] Because I just don't care
[2302.34 → 2303.36] anymore at this point.
[2303.68 → 2303.78] What a guy.
[2303.78 → 2305.82] I am actually pretty psyched
[2305.82 → 2306.92] for the you know what, here,
[2307.24 → 2308.54] let's blow through Ry zen 3.
[2308.66 → 2308.82] Oh.
[2308.86 → 2309.86] That's the opposite of
[2309.86 → 2310.70] first world problems.
[2310.82 → 2311.90] That's just, like, first world
[2311.90 → 2312.40] excess.
[2313.56 → 2313.96] Sorry.
[2314.30 → 2315.66] I have a matching phone for,
[2315.76 → 2316.62] I have a matching watch for
[2316.62 → 2317.00] my phone.
[2317.94 → 2318.92] It's perfect all the time.
[2318.96 → 2320.18] You know what, it's not that
[2320.18 → 2321.36] different from people who have
[2321.36 → 2322.48] watches for their outfits.
[2323.06 → 2324.22] In fact, it's very different.
[2324.32 → 2325.42] I only need two watches.
[2325.44 → 2325.82] That's much more practical.
[2326.22 → 2327.64] That is not more practical.
[2327.76 → 2328.42] No, your way.
[2328.44 → 2329.70] Oh, oh, I see.
[2329.82 → 2331.82] I was admitting a minor
[2331.82 → 2332.56] amount of defeat.
[2332.74 → 2332.92] Yeah.
[2334.92 → 2336.66] So anyway, AMD accidentally
[2336.66 → 2337.84] reveals Ry zen 3 details.
[2337.96 → 2339.14] It's quad-core without SMT.
[2339.26 → 2340.58] It'll use the same dies, Ry zen 5,
[2340.64 → 2340.98] and Ry zen 7.
[2341.04 → 2341.80] Oh, that's surprising, actually.
[2341.80 → 2342.74] Luke don't get paid enough.
[2342.84 → 2345.20] Even if I did, I wouldn't do
[2345.20 → 2345.48] that.
[2345.84 → 2347.08] Four cores distributed over
[2347.08 → 2348.94] two CCXs, but we saw that
[2348.94 → 2350.22] that wasn't a huge deal with
[2350.22 → 2351.42] the lower end Ry zen 5s.
[2351.82 → 2353.34] Same cache structures, Ry zen 5
[2353.34 → 2355.14] 1400, blah, blah, blah, blah,
[2355.14 → 2355.92] blah, blah, blah, blah.
[2356.00 → 2357.48] TDP will still be the same
[2357.48 → 2357.96] 65 watt.
[2358.00 → 2359.36] But as we know, the TDP ratings
[2359.36 → 2361.48] for CPUs, like, Intel rates
[2361.48 → 2365.22] all of their HDT chips, like,
[2365.30 → 2366.04] 130 watts.
[2366.48 → 2366.70] Yeah.
[2366.70 → 2369.12] Clearly the ones with twice
[2369.12 → 2371.24] as many cores clearly consume
[2371.24 → 2371.74] more power.
[2371.92 → 2372.14] Yeah.
[2372.48 → 2372.80] Clearly.
[2373.42 → 2374.26] So there's that.
[2374.38 → 2375.36] Just, like, blanket statement
[2375.36 → 2375.96] whole areas.
[2376.56 → 2377.72] Yeah, I had wanted to chat
[2377.72 → 2379.22] about, oh, yeah, you know
[2379.22 → 2379.46] what?
[2380.38 → 2381.14] Well, do you want to do this
[2381.14 → 2381.66] first or that?
[2381.76 → 2382.30] Why don't we do that?
[2382.42 → 2382.92] Let's do that.
[2383.04 → 2383.26] Okay.
[2383.40 → 2383.62] Okay.
[2383.76 → 2384.72] I realize what we're saying
[2384.72 → 2385.70] right now is very cryptic,
[2385.90 → 2388.24] but this is important.
[2388.54 → 2388.76] Yeah.
[2388.76 → 2389.90] If you are not already on
[2389.90 → 2392.84] float plane, this is the week.
[2393.38 → 2394.30] Well, other than, like, a
[2394.30 → 2394.54] Scrapyard Wars week.
[2394.54 → 2395.48] Other than Scrapyard Wars.
[2395.48 → 2397.30] Because unlike Scrapyard Wars,
[2397.42 → 2398.52] where we have one piece of
[2398.52 → 2401.24] content that, like, half of
[2401.24 → 2404.30] our community cannot wait to
[2404.30 → 2407.52] watch, we have four pieces of
[2407.52 → 2409.38] content right now that are
[2409.38 → 2411.72] behind the early access wall on
[2411.72 → 2413.80] float plane that are freaking
[2413.80 → 2415.80] unreal, but they'll all be
[2415.80 → 2417.04] coming sometime in the next
[2417.04 → 2417.20] week.
[2417.30 → 2417.64] So if you care at all.
[2417.64 → 2418.92] I've watched all of them, and
[2418.92 → 2420.38] I don't normally watch our
[2420.38 → 2421.52] videos even that often.
[2422.94 → 2423.90] Well, okay, because I hear
[2423.90 → 2425.36] about everything that's going
[2425.36 → 2427.02] on, and I'll, like, talk to
[2427.02 → 2428.34] the writer that's working on
[2428.34 → 2429.90] it and know their conclusions
[2429.90 → 2430.36] and stuff.
[2430.36 → 2430.84] Wow, dick.
[2431.08 → 2431.72] I'm just saying.
[2431.84 → 2432.10] Okay.
[2433.20 → 2435.06] So, LTT video.
[2436.00 → 2437.76] Exposing Deadmau5's studio.
[2437.98 → 2439.74] Spoiler, he's a huge geek.
[2440.50 → 2441.72] This isn't even an LTT video,
[2441.82 → 2442.86] but do cell phones actually
[2442.86 → 2443.42] cause cancer?
[2443.52 → 2444.44] It was an entertaining
[2444.44 → 2445.22] tech wiki to make.
[2445.26 → 2446.52] You probably know the answer,
[2446.90 → 2448.32] I kind of hope, but, like,
[2448.52 → 2449.74] it's a good thing to send to
[2449.74 → 2450.02] people that don't.
[2450.02 → 2451.08] Not everybody does, or we
[2451.08 → 2451.92] wouldn't have made the video.
[2452.04 → 2452.26] Fair.
[2452.26 → 2453.74] Um, LTT.
[2454.74 → 2456.62] Unboxing a quantum computer.
[2456.86 → 2457.94] That was very cool.
[2458.56 → 2459.00] Um.
[2459.12 → 2459.78] That was awesome.
[2460.66 → 2461.58] So was the Deadmau5 one.
[2461.62 → 2462.40] Those were both really awesome.
[2462.64 → 2463.00] LTT.
[2463.34 → 2465.34] The most important iPad video
[2465.34 → 2465.76] in years.
[2465.80 → 2466.74] Which actually got lost in
[2466.74 → 2467.08] translation.
[2467.24 → 2468.04] It's supposed to be the most
[2468.04 → 2469.84] important iPad in years.
[2470.34 → 2470.86] But that's okay.
[2470.92 → 2471.54] We'll figure that out.
[2471.58 → 2472.82] Also, there's a giraffe in the
[2472.82 → 2473.14] video.
[2473.56 → 2475.10] Which is why it says gone wild.
[2475.24 → 2476.72] See, we're all about clickbait.
[2476.84 → 2477.42] That's true.
[2477.54 → 2477.76] Yeah.
[2478.92 → 2479.16] LTT.
[2479.68 → 2481.70] The ultimate RGB build guide.
[2482.58 → 2483.02] Yes.
[2483.18 → 2484.96] Build guides are back in a real
[2484.96 → 2485.36] way.
[2485.80 → 2486.62] Just to, okay, okay.
[2486.76 → 2487.56] This one I'll tease.
[2489.60 → 2490.46] Uh, class.
[2490.80 → 2491.16] Distinction.
[2491.28 → 2491.68] I didn't even know you could do
[2491.68 → 2491.92] that.
[2492.18 → 2492.58] I'm sorry?
[2492.72 → 2493.56] I didn't even know you could do
[2493.56 → 2494.86] it in, like, the post-preview.
[2495.24 → 2496.24] Check out this intro.
[2496.52 → 2497.44] This is very cool.
[2497.58 → 2497.74] Yeah.
[2499.18 → 2500.48] The best part is, can you
[2500.48 → 2501.56] identify all the people?
[2501.68 → 2502.74] I can tell who some of them
[2502.74 → 2502.98] are.
[2503.24 → 2504.22] Except for when they're running
[2504.22 → 2504.42] by.
[2504.52 → 2505.10] That's James.
[2505.10 → 2505.34] Yeah.
[2505.46 → 2506.62] That was very obvious.
[2506.84 → 2507.02] Yeah.
[2507.02 → 2510.60] I can identify everyone
[2510.60 → 2511.56] except for when they're all
[2511.56 → 2512.70] running by all at once.
[2512.80 → 2513.08] Anyway.
[2513.24 → 2513.90] Then it gets messy.
[2514.00 → 2514.96] That's a great video.
[2515.48 → 2515.92] LTT.
[2516.32 → 2518.22] Can you plastic dip a whole
[2518.22 → 2519.84] PC inside and out?
[2520.26 → 2520.70] LTT.
[2521.24 → 2522.90] Unboxing Canada's biggest
[2522.90 → 2523.70] supercomputer.
[2524.70 → 2525.88] Um, yeah.
[2526.30 → 2526.70] LTT.
[2526.86 → 2527.96] Can you plastic dip a whole
[2527.96 → 2528.36] PC?
[2528.58 → 2529.68] Is actually hilarious.
[2529.76 → 2530.02] Yeah.
[2530.02 → 2532.92] So, next week is going to be
[2532.92 → 2534.90] ridiculous because many of
[2534.90 → 2536.00] these projects were things
[2536.00 → 2536.86] that we've been working on
[2536.86 → 2539.00] for weeks and or months.
[2539.52 → 2541.52] And they just all kind of
[2541.52 → 2543.20] came together at the same
[2543.20 → 2543.52] time.
[2543.60 → 2544.74] In fact, if I was, like, in
[2544.74 → 2545.82] charge of programming here,
[2546.10 → 2547.90] I might not have necessarily,
[2548.08 → 2549.04] like, I might have tried to
[2549.04 → 2550.70] find other sort of, I don't
[2550.70 → 2552.24] want to say crappier stuff,
[2553.20 → 2557.44] but less expensive content to
[2557.44 → 2560.00] produce to, like, space
[2560.00 → 2561.04] things out a little bit.
[2561.58 → 2563.34] Um, but if you guys want to
[2563.34 → 2564.74] join the Float plane Club,
[2565.12 → 2567.60] um, basically the way to do
[2567.60 → 2568.46] it, you got the link, you
[2568.46 → 2569.06] posted in the chat?
[2569.68 → 2569.80] Yeah.
[2569.80 → 2570.62] Yeah, okay, good.
[2570.68 → 2571.62] LTT bots got that.
[2572.02 → 2573.72] Now is kind of the time to do
[2573.72 → 2573.98] it.
[2574.64 → 2576.90] And, uh, yeah, it's going to be,
[2576.96 → 2577.96] it's going to be a good time.
[2578.00 → 2579.12] It's going to be a good time over
[2579.12 → 2579.98] on Float plane right now.
[2580.00 → 2580.96] If you want to binge-watch all
[2580.96 → 2582.00] that stuff, you're going to be,
[2582.06 → 2582.72] you're going to like it.
[2583.96 → 2585.30] Um, okay.
[2585.72 → 2586.78] So, Apple.
[2587.12 → 2588.20] Moving on to news.
[2588.28 → 2589.48] This was posted by WE
[2589.48 → 2591.08] Groom AK on the forum,
[2591.16 → 2591.98] and the original article
[2591.98 → 2593.62] is from Gadget.
[2593.84 → 2595.74] It looks like Vivo?
[2597.74 → 2598.04] What?
[2598.40 → 2598.88] Vivo.
[2600.22 → 2601.72] Oh, that's what happened there.
[2601.84 → 2602.02] What?
[2602.52 → 2605.18] Beats Apple to an under-display
[2605.18 → 2606.64] fingerprint scanner.
[2606.64 → 2610.14] But they say that, uh, the
[2610.14 → 2612.04] technology still has a way to
[2612.04 → 2612.18] go.
[2612.26 → 2613.16] I mean, that's how it sometimes
[2613.16 → 2615.20] is, where people are like,
[2615.24 → 2616.66] yeah, Apple never invented
[2616.66 → 2617.12] anything.
[2617.76 → 2618.78] Whereas a lot of the time,
[2618.82 → 2619.84] Apple doesn't invent it.
[2619.88 → 2621.02] They just kind of come along
[2621.02 → 2623.08] and use it when, when it's
[2623.08 → 2624.16] actually mature enough.
[2624.58 → 2626.40] Yeah, to be clear, it's a it's
[2626.40 → 2628.64] a, uh, Qualcomm technology.
[2628.90 → 2629.08] Yeah.
[2629.08 → 2631.56] Um, so this is an ultrasonic
[2631.56 → 2633.46] fingerprint solution offering
[2633.46 → 2635.74] integration beneath OLED
[2635.74 → 2637.52] displays up to 1.2 millimetres
[2637.52 → 2637.88] thick.
[2637.94 → 2639.26] Like, that's pretty thick.
[2639.34 → 2640.06] That's a fair amount.
[2640.28 → 2640.70] For an OLED.
[2641.10 → 2643.22] Um, as well as aluminum even.
[2644.16 → 2645.20] That's freaking cool.
[2645.24 → 2645.76] That's pretty crazy.
[2645.76 → 2646.92] Like, if the whole phone,
[2647.04 → 2647.76] imagine this.
[2647.94 → 2649.12] If you could have, like,
[2650.20 → 2651.46] if you could have, like, uh,
[2651.46 → 2652.54] just to unlock your phone
[2652.54 → 2653.62] is, like, easy.
[2653.78 → 2654.58] Like, it's just one.
[2654.78 → 2656.32] And then to access your
[2656.32 → 2657.90] encrypted folder, you have
[2657.90 → 2658.84] to put, like, all five
[2658.84 → 2659.54] fingers on it.
[2659.54 → 2660.74] Or you have to, like, can
[2660.74 → 2661.22] you imagine that?
[2661.22 → 2661.90] That would be pretty cool.
[2661.98 → 2663.18] So if you had, like, you
[2663.18 → 2664.02] could have, like, the
[2664.02 → 2665.20] fingerprint down here.
[2665.40 → 2666.72] And then, like, all four
[2666.72 → 2667.90] fingers on the back have to
[2667.90 → 2668.26] engage.
[2668.62 → 2668.98] Yes.
[2669.02 → 2669.60] That would be pretty neat.
[2669.68 → 2670.74] I would love that.
[2670.80 → 2671.46] It'd have to be really
[2671.46 → 2672.16] accurate for that.
[2672.22 → 2673.86] First gen stuff's not gonna
[2673.86 → 2674.28] have that.
[2674.28 → 2674.42] Yeah.
[2674.42 → 2675.24] But that's the kind of
[2675.24 → 2676.20] stuff I'd love to see in
[2676.20 → 2676.58] the future.
[2677.28 → 2678.66] Um, apparently it works
[2678.66 → 2679.74] even when the device is
[2679.74 → 2680.72] immersed in water.
[2681.16 → 2681.38] Yeah.
[2681.38 → 2682.84] Which is a huge problem
[2682.84 → 2683.80] with existing fingerprint
[2683.80 → 2684.30] sensors.
[2684.58 → 2685.70] And it tolerates...
[2685.70 → 2686.92] To be fair, not because
[2686.92 → 2687.78] you're, like, swimming with
[2687.78 → 2688.48] your phone all the time.
[2688.50 → 2688.64] Yeah.
[2688.76 → 2689.70] But, like, if it's raining
[2689.70 → 2690.70] or something like that, if
[2690.70 → 2691.50] it's a little bit wet, it
[2691.50 → 2692.30] can be really annoying.
[2692.44 → 2693.76] Or, like, if you sweat as
[2693.76 → 2694.56] much as I do.
[2695.56 → 2696.78] I mean, like, sports.
[2696.96 → 2697.80] Not just in general.
[2697.80 → 2699.02] Like, I'm not sweaty right
[2699.02 → 2699.22] now.
[2699.46 → 2700.62] I mean, I touched your shirt
[2700.62 → 2701.52] so I could be as sweaty
[2701.52 → 2704.00] as, you know...
[2704.00 → 2705.28] Yeah, he's good.
[2705.52 → 2705.78] He's good.
[2707.22 → 2708.20] Scientific test.
[2708.62 → 2709.78] Very scientific test.
[2709.98 → 2711.56] Oh, that was really
[2711.56 → 2711.94] awkward.
[2711.94 → 2713.74] I have problems with
[2713.74 → 2714.78] fingerprint scanners, though.
[2715.42 → 2717.10] Because I have, as you know,
[2717.20 → 2718.32] annoyingly sweaty hands.
[2718.96 → 2720.06] You're not nearly as bad
[2720.06 → 2720.72] as when I met you.
[2720.96 → 2721.06] Yeah.
[2721.06 → 2722.32] When I met you, it was,
[2722.40 → 2723.88] like, full-on hyperhidrosis.
[2724.34 → 2724.74] Like...
[2724.74 → 2727.94] It has gotten a little bit
[2727.94 → 2728.18] better.
[2728.50 → 2730.12] Like, I would go out of my
[2730.12 → 2732.62] way to, like, not touch him.
[2732.68 → 2733.90] Like, when I shook hands at
[2733.90 → 2735.00] his interview, I was just,
[2735.12 → 2737.08] like, can I hire this guy?
[2737.28 → 2738.56] I also used to, like, if I
[2738.56 → 2738.94] went on a...
[2738.94 → 2739.98] Let's get personal here for a
[2739.98 → 2740.14] second.
[2740.44 → 2741.40] If I went on a date with
[2741.40 → 2742.08] someone, I would, like,
[2742.16 → 2743.10] avoid that.
[2744.08 → 2745.50] You would avoid hand-holding.
[2745.56 → 2746.58] So you would just straight
[2746.58 → 2747.54] grab her by the...
[2747.54 → 2749.66] I'd do, like, arm over or...
[2749.66 → 2751.54] I don't go...
[2751.54 → 2752.42] No, I don't go Trump-style
[2752.42 → 2752.78] with that.
[2752.86 → 2753.98] But I'd try to go, like,
[2754.02 → 2755.94] arm over shoulders or, like,
[2756.28 → 2756.98] something...
[2756.98 → 2757.88] I would even do the like,
[2758.02 → 2759.48] joking arm-in-arm-we're-being-
[2759.48 → 2760.62] funny old-school thing.
[2761.08 → 2761.44] Wow!
[2761.62 → 2762.54] That's cringe, dude.
[2762.54 → 2763.90] Well, I would do it as a joke,
[2764.02 → 2764.74] to be clear.
[2764.92 → 2766.38] But I would do that for, like,
[2766.38 → 2767.66] a couple seconds to try to
[2767.66 → 2768.66] show, like, I'm not being
[2768.66 → 2770.40] standoffish, but also I'm
[2770.40 → 2771.18] going to do this as a joke
[2771.18 → 2772.38] and then stop because I
[2772.38 → 2772.98] don't want to hold your
[2772.98 → 2773.24] hand.
[2774.74 → 2775.10] Wow!
[2775.20 → 2776.14] Because I was like, yeah,
[2776.18 → 2777.02] it's pretty gnarly.
[2778.04 → 2779.56] It's mostly fine now.
[2780.02 → 2780.42] Okay.
[2781.46 → 2782.40] Yeah, how's it going?
[2783.48 → 2785.18] So anyway, Vivo's X-Play
[2785.18 → 2786.48] 6 demonstrated the
[2786.48 → 2786.98] technology.
[2787.10 → 2788.76] The demo started off with a
[2788.76 → 2789.56] fingerprint registration
[2789.56 → 2790.68] process that requested
[2790.68 → 2791.58] blah, blah, blah, etc,
[2791.70 → 2791.94] etc.
[2792.32 → 2793.58] Then the user would be able
[2793.58 → 2794.64] to unlock the phone by
[2794.64 → 2795.58] touching the spot where
[2795.58 → 2796.76] they did the setup process
[2796.76 → 2799.60] or somewhere else.
[2800.64 → 2802.46] So fingerprint recognition
[2802.46 → 2803.50] speed in this implementation
[2803.50 → 2805.24] is slower than the near
[2805.24 → 2806.46] instantaneous unlock we
[2806.46 → 2807.44] expect from normal
[2807.44 → 2808.18] fingerprint scanners,
[2808.30 → 2809.70] about a second between
[2809.70 → 2810.48] the first touch and
[2810.48 → 2811.32] entering the home screen.
[2811.94 → 2813.12] But they said the same
[2813.12 → 2813.80] tech could be applied
[2813.80 → 2814.92] across the entire screen.
[2815.00 → 2815.60] Oh, wait, no, hold on.
[2815.60 → 2816.66] Oh, yeah.
[2816.82 → 2817.62] So they touched a
[2817.62 → 2818.90] different area just above
[2818.90 → 2819.86] the old fingerprint button.
[2820.64 → 2821.70] So instead, they might
[2821.70 → 2822.68] eventually cover just the
[2822.68 → 2823.74] bottom half of the screen
[2823.74 → 2824.64] rather than the whole
[2824.64 → 2826.80] screen to save cost.
[2827.10 → 2828.68] And yeah, same tech
[2828.68 → 2829.50] shown on the back of
[2829.50 → 2830.18] the phone's body,
[2830.26 → 2830.78] allowing it to be
[2830.78 → 2831.58] unlocked even when
[2831.58 → 2832.20] placed in water.
[2832.32 → 2833.46] Pretty freaking cool.
[2833.46 → 2833.86] Yeah.
[2834.66 → 2836.08] I really like, like, I
[2836.08 → 2837.42] very much like the
[2837.42 → 2838.32] fingerprint unlock on the
[2838.32 → 2838.88] back of the pixel.
[2839.58 → 2840.66] I'm a huge fan of that.
[2842.66 → 2843.14] Um...
[2843.14 → 2844.44] Are we going into this?
[2844.78 → 2845.78] Yeah, I don't know.
[2845.88 → 2846.30] Should we?
[2846.42 → 2847.36] Or is it just boring?
[2847.60 → 2848.66] I want to talk about
[2848.66 → 2849.60] Ethereum mining.
[2850.52 → 2850.86] Okay, yeah.
[2850.86 → 2851.88] This is a really quick
[2851.88 → 2852.80] one, but this was
[2852.80 → 2854.30] posted on Futurism and
[2854.30 → 2855.18] the original post on the
[2855.18 → 2856.90] forum was Ginger137.
[2859.68 → 2860.92] And the headline kind of
[2860.92 → 2861.36] says it all.
[2861.44 → 2862.36] There's not a lot
[2862.36 → 2863.52] more to say at this point.
[2864.18 → 2865.52] Ethereum could be using
[2865.52 → 2866.94] more than an entire
[2866.94 → 2867.88] country's worth of
[2867.88 → 2868.30] electricity.
[2868.48 → 2869.00] Now, of course, we
[2869.00 → 2870.86] don't mean like China or
[2870.86 → 2871.74] the US or whatever.
[2872.66 → 2873.68] Oh, hi, guys.
[2875.12 → 2877.46] But I think the
[2877.46 → 2878.36] country that we were
[2878.36 → 2880.46] talking about was...
[2881.22 → 2882.82] Oh, a small country.
[2882.94 → 2883.30] Cyprus.
[2883.96 → 2885.22] So a bit more than
[2885.22 → 2886.48] what's consumed by the
[2886.48 → 2887.48] island of Cyprus.
[2887.88 → 2890.54] So 4.2 terawatt hours.
[2892.14 → 2892.66] Wow.
[2893.10 → 2894.30] That's pretty insane.
[2896.76 → 2898.72] So one major reason for
[2898.72 → 2899.78] this is the power-hungry
[2899.78 → 2900.76] graphics cards that are
[2900.76 → 2901.68] involved, but this might
[2901.68 → 2902.62] not be the case for long.
[2902.76 → 2903.72] Ethereum has plans to
[2903.72 → 2905.06] move away from its
[2905.06 → 2906.66] existing energy-intensive
[2906.66 → 2907.78] mining algorithms.
[2909.06 → 2910.16] So there you go.
[2910.16 → 2911.14] I wonder what that means
[2911.14 → 2912.06] for people's hardware.
[2912.38 → 2913.10] If it's just an
[2913.10 → 2914.04] algorithm thing, like,
[2914.20 → 2914.96] will that rebalance
[2914.96 → 2916.62] what is better at it?
[2916.76 → 2918.34] It means a lot of cheap
[2918.34 → 2920.18] 580s on eBay.
[2922.18 → 2923.66] Hopefully, because honestly,
[2923.74 → 2924.36] I was talking to someone
[2924.36 → 2924.78] the other day.
[2925.10 → 2926.32] Buying a computer right
[2926.32 → 2926.60] now?
[2926.68 → 2927.24] Kind of sucks.
[2927.78 → 2928.70] Holy crap.
[2928.80 → 2929.68] It's a great time to buy
[2929.68 → 2930.14] a CPU.
[2931.10 → 2931.90] Yeah, but okay.
[2932.06 → 2932.84] But on the counter
[2932.84 → 2934.26] argument, and people
[2934.26 → 2935.14] are going to hate me for
[2935.14 → 2937.74] this, but it's kind of
[2937.74 → 2939.28] rough to get into PC
[2939.28 → 2940.12] gaming right now.
[2940.34 → 2941.66] And I actually see a lot
[2941.66 → 2942.40] of people going like,
[2942.54 → 2944.10] okay, well, the graphics
[2944.10 → 2945.30] card that I want is going
[2945.30 → 2946.32] to cost more than the
[2946.32 → 2947.14] freaking console.
[2947.60 → 2947.88] Yep.
[2948.60 → 2950.04] And like, it's hard to
[2950.04 → 2950.48] justify.
[2950.92 → 2951.18] Yep.
[2951.40 → 2952.62] It's genuinely a little
[2952.62 → 2953.26] bit hard to justify.
[2953.26 → 2954.04] Just because the graphics
[2954.04 → 2955.56] cards are so expensive.
[2955.56 → 2957.66] And if I'm AMD, I certainly
[2957.66 → 2958.88] want to sell graphics cards
[2958.88 → 2959.96] for as much as I can.
[2960.08 → 2960.42] Of course.
[2960.54 → 2960.84] Why not?
[2961.24 → 2962.48] Or NVIDIA for that matter,
[2962.60 → 2963.68] although NVIDIA has been a
[2963.68 → 2964.94] little less popular on the
[2964.94 → 2965.96] whole Ethereum mining side
[2965.96 → 2966.32] of things.
[2966.44 → 2967.18] And like, I've seen some
[2967.18 → 2968.58] stuff where people are
[2968.58 → 2970.22] trying to snipe out stores
[2970.22 → 2971.18] because certain stores
[2971.18 → 2971.96] aren't increasing their
[2971.96 → 2973.04] prices because they're just
[2973.04 → 2973.92] trying to go for MSRP.
[2974.14 → 2974.88] And RAM too.
[2974.98 → 2976.16] There's a worldwide DRAM
[2976.16 → 2977.36] shortage that's expected to
[2977.36 → 2978.44] last well into next year.
[2978.66 → 2979.82] It's great for companies like
[2979.82 → 2980.98] Corsair because it's
[2980.98 → 2981.36] hilarious.
[2981.36 → 2983.20] Like RAM makers like
[2983.20 → 2984.96] Corsair and Kingston where
[2984.96 → 2987.54] they buy modules and then
[2987.54 → 2988.22] sell them.
[2988.90 → 2990.34] It's great for them because
[2990.34 → 2992.32] as much as it's frustrating
[2992.32 → 2993.48] for them to not be able to
[2993.48 → 2994.66] get as much allocation as
[2994.66 → 2996.66] they'd like to sell, their
[2996.66 → 2998.00] margin on a product like
[2998.00 → 3000.32] that is kind of set because
[3000.32 → 3001.38] there are a lot of competitors
[3001.38 → 3002.36] out there and everybody's
[3002.36 → 3004.20] kind of in that 7 to 12%
[3004.20 → 3005.74] range pretty much, give or
[3005.74 → 3005.94] take.
[3006.50 → 3008.00] But even though they're
[3008.00 → 3009.98] selling less, what they do
[3009.98 → 3013.72] sell hits their revenue
[3013.72 → 3014.78] numbers a lot harder.
[3015.18 → 3016.14] So they're doing more
[3016.14 → 3018.78] revenue and making 10%,
[3018.78 → 3020.96] let's say, on a $50
[3020.96 → 3022.68] transaction versus making
[3022.68 → 3024.86] 10% on a $100 transaction
[3024.86 → 3027.10] having to do all the same
[3027.10 → 3028.44] fixed cost things.
[3029.38 → 3031.50] So the processing fee,
[3031.92 → 3033.96] transportation, marketing,
[3034.36 → 3035.06] packaging.
[3035.36 → 3035.52] Yeah.
[3036.12 → 3038.26] Hey, that's great for them.
[3038.26 → 3041.12] Speaking of the memory
[3041.12 → 3044.66] business, RIP Lear memory
[3044.66 → 3045.16] cards.
[3045.22 → 3046.40] This was posted by Shutter
[3046.40 → 3047.86] Boy on the forum.
[3047.98 → 3049.22] The original article here is
[3049.22 → 3050.12] from Megapixel.
[3051.38 → 3053.22] But Crucial, I don't know if
[3053.22 → 3054.42] you guys know this, but
[3054.42 → 3057.10] Micron, parent company of
[3057.10 → 3060.98] Crucial and Lear, Micron
[3060.98 → 3063.10] just kind of went, yeah, you
[3063.10 → 3063.78] know what?
[3063.78 → 3066.70] Compared to the lucrative
[3066.70 → 3068.62] business of selling Flash to
[3068.62 → 3070.72] companies like Amazon and
[3070.72 → 3075.06] Google, selling like SD cards
[3075.06 → 3077.64] is a fool's errand due to those
[3077.64 → 3079.62] low margins and low volumes.
[3079.68 → 3081.28] All that packaging and all that
[3081.28 → 3082.66] marketing involved in what?
[3083.44 → 3084.80] This tiny transaction?
[3085.00 → 3085.58] This is stupid.
[3085.74 → 3087.30] So they're just like, forget it.
[3087.42 → 3089.38] And they are shutting down their
[3089.38 → 3091.58] removable storage retail business.
[3091.58 → 3092.74] I hope they don't shut down
[3092.74 → 3094.84] Crucial because their Facebook
[3094.84 → 3095.78] page is hilarious.
[3096.18 → 3097.36] Other products that are being
[3097.36 → 3099.06] killed off include USB flash
[3099.06 → 3100.70] drives, memory card readers and
[3100.70 → 3102.10] storage drives, which honestly,
[3102.32 → 3104.52] I'm kind of not stoked on because
[3104.52 → 3107.12] the only pro grade card readers
[3107.12 → 3109.50] that we could find are those
[3109.50 → 3110.76] Lear ones that we're using.
[3110.82 → 3111.86] We should scoop up a few.
[3112.42 → 3113.08] I'm not even kidding.
[3113.24 → 3114.60] We might even do that.
[3114.68 → 3114.86] Yeah.
[3114.96 → 3116.40] Although I did run into someone at
[3116.40 → 3117.78] Computer that's making something
[3117.78 → 3118.98] that looks really pro and that
[3118.98 → 3121.54] has SSD and Red Meg versions as
[3121.54 → 3121.72] well.
[3121.90 → 3123.86] They're like rack mount and you
[3123.86 → 3124.70] can, and they're modular.
[3124.98 → 3126.48] So I'll look into those.
[3126.58 → 3127.50] They run off Thunderbolt too.
[3127.56 → 3128.66] And our ingest stations are
[3128.66 → 3129.08] Thunderbolt.
[3129.16 → 3129.52] That's pretty.
[3129.58 → 3130.14] So we'll see.
[3130.30 → 3130.52] Yeah.
[3130.74 → 3132.48] But if that doesn't pan out or if
[3132.48 → 3135.82] that product sucks, Lear is all
[3135.82 → 3136.60] I kind of got.
[3137.16 → 3138.74] But the decision was made as part
[3138.74 → 3140.32] of the company's ongoing efforts to
[3140.32 → 3141.46] focus on its increasing
[3141.46 → 3142.78] opportunities in higher value
[3142.78 → 3143.64] markets and channels.
[3143.64 → 3147.46] So basically like Lear products,
[3147.92 → 3148.70] suck it.
[3150.76 → 3152.96] They are exploring opportunities to
[3152.96 → 3154.48] sell all or part of the Lear
[3154.48 → 3154.98] business.
[3155.18 → 3156.84] But what that means is basically
[3156.84 → 3158.76] that Lear won't be Lear.
[3158.90 → 3159.14] Yeah.
[3159.28 → 3161.16] In much the same way that the
[3161.16 → 3162.82] Sharp is trying to get their brand
[3162.82 → 3164.06] back in North America because
[3164.06 → 3165.62] they're actually suing over
[3165.62 → 3166.74] Hi sense.
[3166.98 → 3167.92] I believe it's Hi sense.
[3168.38 → 3169.72] I'm going to double-check before I
[3169.72 → 3171.28] like disparage a brand.
[3172.68 → 3173.16] Sharp.
[3173.64 → 3174.40] Hi sense.
[3175.26 → 3176.06] Lawsuit, I think.
[3176.70 → 3176.84] Yeah.
[3177.18 → 3177.34] Yeah.
[3177.44 → 3179.36] Sharp saying that Hi sense's
[3179.36 → 3181.86] shoddily manufactured TVs are
[3181.86 → 3183.18] hurting their brand image.
[3183.52 → 3183.88] What?
[3183.96 → 3185.22] Even though they were the ones who
[3185.22 → 3187.00] sold the business unit to Hi sense.
[3187.20 → 3187.98] They sold it.
[3188.02 → 3189.32] Can they do anything about that?
[3189.34 → 3189.70] I don't know.
[3189.74 → 3190.58] But it explains.
[3190.92 → 3192.98] You know how we go to CES and
[3192.98 → 3194.54] we're like, what the heck is
[3194.54 → 3194.86] Hi sense?
[3194.86 → 3195.26] Yes.
[3195.42 → 3195.62] Yeah.
[3195.86 → 3196.92] Why are they even here?
[3197.16 → 3197.42] Yeah.
[3197.84 → 3199.04] Now I finally get it.
[3199.16 → 3199.42] Yes.
[3201.38 → 3202.00] What else?
[3202.00 → 3203.22] What else we got for this week?
[3203.22 → 3206.06] There's not a ton.
[3206.40 → 3207.90] There's that weird Canada thing
[3207.90 → 3209.32] which might affect other people.
[3209.46 → 3209.96] So I don't know.
[3210.04 → 3210.88] We might want to talk about that.
[3211.12 → 3212.36] There's the tech power-up thing.
[3212.66 → 3213.80] I'm wondering on your opinion on
[3213.80 → 3214.30] that, actually.
[3215.14 → 3215.50] Okay.
[3215.56 → 3215.90] I'm sorry.
[3215.96 → 3216.98] I really haven't looked into this.
[3216.98 → 3220.14] Oh, and there's not a ton to look
[3220.14 → 3220.50] into it.
[3220.54 → 3222.20] You can look into it really quick.
[3222.20 → 3224.06] So, should I start on it?
[3224.82 → 3225.02] Sure.
[3225.02 → 3225.68] Having not read it?
[3225.94 → 3226.06] Yeah.
[3226.06 → 3227.18] It was posted on the forum by
[3227.18 → 3228.86] eyes can't see over 24 FPS
[3228.86 → 3230.34] and that was the only way
[3230.34 → 3231.74] you were going to get me to say
[3231.74 → 3233.50] those words all together
[3233.50 → 3234.28] in that order.
[3234.38 → 3235.24] Very, very funny.
[3235.32 → 3236.56] You know that's going to get clipped.
[3236.58 → 3237.86] You gigantic troll.
[3237.94 → 3239.18] Like, really tightly clipped.
[3239.32 → 3239.74] I know.
[3239.74 → 3242.24] And the original article here
[3242.24 → 3244.14] is from DeliddedTech.com
[3244.14 → 3245.38] which I've actually never heard of.
[3245.92 → 3247.44] What's DeliddedTech.com?
[3247.76 → 3248.50] I don't know.
[3249.30 → 3249.54] Wow.
[3249.60 → 3252.80] This looks like a very small site.
[3253.68 → 3254.92] And I'm not hating or anything.
[3257.02 → 3259.34] But basically, the controversy
[3259.34 → 3263.98] is over a tech power-up article
[3263.98 → 3266.30] that appeared to be an article anyway
[3266.30 → 3268.06] that was a comparison between
[3268.06 → 3270.00] AMD's Radeon RX 560
[3270.00 → 3271.80] and NVIDIA's GTX 1050
[3271.80 → 3274.52] but that was actually an AMD ad.
[3274.86 → 3276.40] The article reads like a review
[3276.40 → 3278.56] with no disclaimers within the article itself
[3278.56 → 3279.50] that it comes from AMD
[3279.50 → 3280.78] or is sponsored by AMD.
[3281.28 → 3283.34] The only ad markers on the page
[3283.34 → 3285.34] were adversarial by AMD
[3285.34 → 3287.12] off to the side on the top right
[3287.12 → 3290.12] and the author being named adversarial.
[3290.64 → 3292.10] The article was posted
[3292.10 → 3295.82] directly in the review section of the site.
[3295.82 → 3300.00] Our forum members apparently disagree
[3300.00 → 3303.48] whether AMD crossed the line.
[3303.62 → 3304.72] I don't know why it wasn't linked
[3304.72 → 3307.92] but here's the actual thing.
[3308.06 → 3309.96] Okay, so let's pull up the article here.
[3311.08 → 3314.60] This does look like an article.
[3314.88 → 3316.26] So they're sponsored right there.
[3317.12 → 3317.42] Yeah.
[3318.08 → 3318.98] Adversarial by AMD.
[3319.24 → 3320.28] Okay, this might be...
[3320.28 → 3321.98] This looks like it's been updated a little bit.
[3322.10 → 3322.80] This might be updated.
[3325.94 → 3326.34] Huh.
[3326.62 → 3328.14] When I first saw this,
[3328.24 → 3330.28] I didn't check for each individual location
[3330.28 → 3331.40] but when I first saw this,
[3331.52 → 3332.78] I was not...
[3332.78 → 3334.42] Oh, it says sponsored right there too.
[3334.48 → 3334.96] Sponsored content by AMD.
[3335.10 → 3335.86] Okay, okay.
[3336.22 → 3338.18] It looks like a few things have been added.
[3341.02 → 3341.42] Huh.
[3341.42 → 3341.54] Huh.
[3341.54 → 3346.02] Interesting.
[3347.12 → 3348.90] So did they run their own benchmarks?
[3349.36 → 3350.44] In its current state,
[3350.66 → 3352.52] what do you think about the transparency?
[3352.82 → 3353.54] Okay, so...
[3354.18 → 3356.54] In its current state.
[3359.90 → 3362.28] The delisted text site doesn't seem to have...
[3362.28 → 3362.60] Huh.
[3363.66 → 3365.80] Oh, I think there's a picture on there, actually.
[3365.80 → 3369.72] So yeah,
[3369.90 → 3373.00] adversarial by AMD above the...
[3373.00 → 3376.26] Here, let's go over to delisted text for a second here
[3376.26 → 3377.40] and show what it used to look like.
[3377.42 → 3378.18] You can just move to my...
[3378.18 → 3379.18] Oh no, mine's screwed.
[3379.22 → 3380.66] Yeah, yours is screwed up right now.
[3380.76 → 3381.00] Sorry.
[3381.10 → 3382.36] So you're going to want to...
[3382.36 → 3382.90] Is it this one?
[3383.40 → 3383.66] Yeah.
[3383.86 → 3384.04] Yeah.
[3384.44 → 3384.72] Okay.
[3385.06 → 3386.86] So here's what it used to look like.
[3388.54 → 3390.80] The writer was adversarial.
[3391.62 → 3393.88] It didn't say sponsored under the 560 logo thing.
[3393.88 → 3395.78] It didn't say sponsored under the logo here.
[3396.10 → 3397.62] And it said introduction
[3397.62 → 3400.36] as though it was an introduction to something.
[3400.82 → 3400.90] Yeah.
[3401.02 → 3403.52] But it did say adversarial by AMD over on the right.
[3403.88 → 3407.30] So it wasn't like impossible to figure out what it was, but...
[3407.30 → 3412.24] I think the word adversarial is a little misleading
[3412.24 → 3416.02] because in my mind an adversarial...
[3416.02 → 3418.40] Okay, so it's like edutainment, right?
[3418.76 → 3419.14] Yeah.
[3419.28 → 3421.56] It's inherently educational and entertaining.
[3421.96 → 3422.90] It sounds like advert and tutorial.
[3423.12 → 3424.06] And it's not a tutorial.
[3424.92 → 3426.20] This isn't a tutorial at all.
[3426.28 → 3426.96] Here, let's read it.
[3427.34 → 3428.16] We'll read it together.
[3428.32 → 3431.00] It's not like how to use AMD graphics cards.
[3431.38 → 3432.20] Adversarial by AMD.
[3432.20 → 3435.30] Last year, AMD introduced the first Polaris generation of GPUs.
[3435.36 → 3438.76] With it, AMD delivered many new features along with great performance in the latest games
[3438.76 → 3440.02] and greatly improved efficiency.
[3440.76 → 3442.80] Like that is not a tutorial.
[3442.80 → 3446.48] Be it esports or AAA titles.
[3446.48 → 3448.62] Best value for the money at around 100 euros.
[3448.84 → 3451.28] Consistently smooth animation in popular games at 1080.
[3451.66 → 3456.10] Avoids performance pitfalls caused by running out of video memory due to 4 gig models being available.
[3456.88 → 3458.04] Okay, none of that's a tutorial.
[3458.74 → 3463.54] For only around 100 euros, the Radeon RX 560 outperforms the competition at this price point
[3463.54 → 3466.40] while showing the significant difference of upgrading from a previous generation.
[3466.50 → 3467.42] Is this their own benchmarks?
[3467.42 → 3471.80] So that's honestly where, that's the one that I don't like.
[3472.60 → 3473.94] Radeon Chill, hold on, hold on.
[3474.02 → 3475.64] Radeon Chill saves power during games.
[3475.74 → 3477.50] It does this in these kinds of titles.
[3478.02 → 3479.88] There is no tutorial.
[3480.78 → 3482.58] Oh, editorial, not tutorial.
[3483.96 → 3484.48] Editorial?
[3486.52 → 3487.30] Is it?
[3489.20 → 3489.72] Interesting.
[3492.06 → 3493.24] Good call, Twitch chat.
[3493.24 → 3493.56] Okay.
[3493.92 → 3495.02] I did not know that.
[3495.16 → 3500.68] I always thought that an adversarial was an ad that was like how to use it.
[3501.00 → 3501.86] I thought it was too.
[3502.08 → 3508.50] Which is what I think an adversarial should be, by the way, because I have no problem with that.
[3508.58 → 3511.26] In fact, that's something that I've been doing for years.
[3511.74 → 3515.68] Is like, here's how to water cool your computer.
[3516.08 → 3519.04] Brought to you by some parts that you can use to do that.
[3519.04 → 3522.98] But all of these things I'm saying still apply to other stuff.
[3523.24 → 3529.96] An adversarial, the proper definition is a newspaper or magazine advertisement, don't worry too much about that,
[3530.26 → 3535.82] giving information about a product in the style of an editorial or objective journalistic article.
[3536.26 → 3536.70] Okay.
[3536.96 → 3538.36] So that's actually fairly transparent.
[3538.88 → 3539.36] Okay.
[3539.66 → 3540.04] All right.
[3540.14 → 3540.40] Fine.
[3540.82 → 3542.20] I don't like, yeah.
[3544.60 → 3546.40] So there are a couple of things here.
[3546.40 → 3549.64] Number one is I think they're going to need to change this title.
[3549.66 → 3551.90] Apparently it says testing done by AMD in the last paragraph.
[3551.90 → 3552.38] Yeah.
[3552.54 → 3554.56] I think it should say that on the chart.
[3554.66 → 3556.54] I think the testing shouldn't be done by AMD.
[3557.02 → 3557.40] That too.
[3557.40 → 3557.72] For one thing.
[3557.98 → 3565.94] So even when we do, so we've actually done a here, the closest thing that we've done was.
[3567.30 → 3567.78] Okay.
[3567.96 → 3571.00] Guys, the testing done by AMD should be on the chart.
[3571.60 → 3571.90] Here.
[3571.90 → 3571.94] Here.
[3572.50 → 3575.26] This is the closest thing we've done actually with AMD.
[3575.80 → 3577.36] Oh, unskippable ads.
[3577.92 → 3578.94] We have unskippable ads?
[3579.02 → 3580.48] They enable after a while.
[3580.70 → 3583.12] So they're on our, um, our back catalogue.
[3583.60 → 3583.88] Oh.
[3584.38 → 3585.24] Do we even do that?
[3585.24 → 3588.16] No, it's something that our MCN does automatically.
[3588.42 → 3588.66] Oh.
[3588.90 → 3589.14] Yeah.
[3590.06 → 3590.50] Okay.
[3590.94 → 3594.68] Can you build a 4K gaming PC for under a thousand dollars?
[3595.32 → 3597.68] Oh, for some reason we're not looking at the beginning of it.
[3598.16 → 3600.84] So we say something, something, something, something, something.
[3601.16 → 3603.06] AMD challenged us to do this.
[3603.64 → 3604.34] Blah, blah, blah.
[3604.74 → 3605.30] Hold on.
[3605.48 → 3605.98] Here we go.
[3605.98 → 3608.26] Is this the sponsored by AMD callout?
[3609.26 → 3610.42] No, I don't think so.
[3611.06 → 3615.58] Um, but this was, uh, this was actually before some of those guidelines came into place.
[3616.04 → 3619.10] And we, uh, let me see where else.
[3619.68 → 3623.28] Anyway, I say it either two or three times in the video verbally.
[3624.42 → 3631.74] Um, when we get to the benchmarks, because AMD's argument to us for doing this piece was that
[3631.74 → 3640.94] you can play popular esports titles at 60 FPS on their affordable, at 4K on their affordable
[3640.94 → 3642.20] all AMD machine.
[3642.78 → 3645.06] We ran these benchmarks ourselves.
[3646.02 → 3651.74] And we told them we're not doing this video unless we can validate this ourselves.
[3652.22 → 3652.32] Yeah.
[3652.40 → 3654.64] And that would have meant not taking the budget.
[3654.94 → 3656.00] That happened.
[3656.00 → 3660.32] Letting AMD run their own benchmarks.
[3662.34 → 3662.78] Yes.
[3662.82 → 3670.08] I think strictly speaking, that does make it exactly as much of an adversarial then as just
[3670.08 → 3674.66] an opinion, but an editorial again, and maybe you can hear it.
[3674.66 → 3676.66] Want to be my definition man for a second here?
[3677.58 → 3678.10] Editorial.
[3678.32 → 3685.98] My understanding means opinion and facts graphs and charts are not.
[3686.00 → 3686.74] Not opinions.
[3687.34 → 3693.06] A newspaper article written by or on behalf of an editor that gives an opinion on a topical
[3693.06 → 3693.48] issue.
[3695.34 → 3701.46] So really that's where the line gets crossed for me because the disclosure is not quite
[3701.46 → 3701.96] good enough.
[3702.14 → 3703.32] It should be in the title.
[3704.28 → 3704.84] Sponsored.
[3705.70 → 3710.08] Should be in the actual title of the article according to like FTC guidelines.
[3710.20 → 3711.48] Like that actually needs to get done.
[3711.48 → 3716.42] All of this stuff is quite a bit better now.
[3717.44 → 3718.40] Adversarial by AMD.
[3719.12 → 3725.88] But in my opinion, these graphs should have either been run by Tech Power Up or they shouldn't
[3725.88 → 3726.38] be here.
[3726.76 → 3728.48] And it should just be an opinion piece.
[3728.48 → 3732.10] At the very least, in my opinion, it needs to be very clear on the graphs that these are
[3732.10 → 3733.42] graphs from the company.
[3733.82 → 3737.48] And then personally, that would just make me not care and I'd move on.
[3737.48 → 3740.52] People are saying the graphs serve as evidence for the opinion of the author, but that's
[3740.52 → 3741.10] exactly it.
[3741.14 → 3742.14] Then it isn't an editorial.
[3743.26 → 3744.38] Then it's not an opinion.
[3745.06 → 3750.74] You can't say, in my opinion, this graphics card runs faster when you actually have facts.
[3750.74 → 3754.54] I mean, it's the whole blurry line between facts and opinion these days.
[3754.54 → 3766.08] But once it's been quantitatively measured in a way that is reproducible and defensible and adheres to the scientific method,
[3766.46 → 3770.46] once it's quantified, it isn't an opinion anymore.
[3770.46 → 3777.04] And a graph inherently suggests that it has been quantified.
[3778.64 → 3780.40] People are saying, but AMD is the author.
[3780.52 → 3784.48] That's fine, but it still isn't an editorial and therefore isn't an adversarial.
[3787.00 → 3789.72] So, yeah.
[3792.02 → 3792.50] Huh.
[3792.50 → 3792.62] Huh.
[3793.70 → 3794.14] Okay.
[3794.40 → 3799.68] I mean, as long as it's disclosed, it's sort of up to them and their relationship with their viewers.
[3800.02 → 3802.42] For our part, we do sponsored content.
[3802.66 → 3804.28] We've done sponsored content for years.
[3805.00 → 3807.04] We say when it's sponsored content.
[3809.28 → 3812.50] I would love to say that we've never used anyone's numbers.
[3813.26 → 3816.80] We've shown slides with a manufacturer's numbers.
[3817.02 → 3820.18] Generally speaking, that would be before we get an opportunity to show our own numbers,
[3820.18 → 3824.08] like at a launch event or when it's being first unveiled at CES, for example.
[3824.38 → 3824.48] Yeah.
[3824.78 → 3827.42] But then it's usually clearly stated that that's their numbers.
[3827.54 → 3829.38] But it's clearly stated that it is someone else's numbers.
[3829.58 → 3832.40] Not quite, but probably almost every time that I've done that, I've been like,
[3832.66 → 3836.32] but we'll have to see when we can get it back into the office for testing of our own.
[3836.50 → 3840.96] I mean, with over 3,000 videos uploaded, I don't want to say we've never shown anybody else's numbers.
[3841.32 → 3844.34] But generally speaking, that's where we draw our line.
[3844.50 → 3848.88] Clear disclosure and running our own validation against the claims of the manufacturer.
[3848.88 → 3849.36] Yeah.
[3849.36 → 3853.76] In this case, I can't speak to their due diligence behind the scenes,
[3853.88 → 3858.50] except to say that this graph doesn't look like it was produced by them.
[3858.56 → 3859.78] It looks like it was produced by AMD.
[3859.90 → 3861.54] For all I know, they ran the numbers.
[3862.56 → 3865.66] But I don't have a way of knowing that.
[3865.68 → 3866.92] Well, no, it says performance by AMD.
[3867.04 → 3867.66] Oh, you know, that's right.
[3867.68 → 3868.56] It does, down at the very bottom.
[3868.64 → 3868.74] Yeah.
[3869.52 → 3874.94] Testing done by AMD Performance Labs, March 1st, 2017, using a Core i7-6700K.
[3876.42 → 3876.96] Oh, boy.
[3876.96 → 3877.02] Okay.
[3879.36 → 3880.32] Yeah.
[3881.38 → 3885.32] So I'm not going to say, look, sponsored content shouldn't exist.
[3885.44 → 3887.66] I'm just going to say it needs to be clearly disclosed.
[3887.66 → 3903.84] And for me personally, I'm very careful about any claims that are made in our publication that I couldn't stand behind,
[3904.18 → 3908.28] whether I was the one who ran the numbers or whether it was my idea or whether it was someone else's idea,
[3908.28 → 3910.76] even in sponsored content.
[3910.76 → 3920.92] And it's up to Tech Power Up to manage their relationship with their audience and their trust with their audience in terms of how they want to proceed with this.
[3921.26 → 3921.52] There.
[3923.90 → 3924.42] Yeah.
[3924.42 → 3925.24] Interesting.
[3925.84 → 3926.50] One more topic?
[3927.32 → 3928.84] Um, I'm kind of done.
[3929.24 → 3929.52] Okay.
[3930.78 → 3931.14] Yeah.
[3931.38 → 3932.08] That's boring.
[3932.20 → 3932.72] That's boring.
[3932.92 → 3933.38] Oh, okay.
[3933.46 → 3934.04] This is kind of cool.
[3934.04 → 3934.70] It's pet, yeah.
[3934.86 → 3935.00] Yeah.
[3935.06 → 3939.22] Coaxial Gamer posted this on the forum original article from Overclock3D.net.
[3939.22 → 3943.38] Toshiba produces the world's first 4-bit per cell.
[3943.78 → 3946.80] So that's QLC NAND flash memory.
[3947.24 → 3949.34] So the endurance on this stuff will suck.
[3950.46 → 3958.52] Like, we're talking a handful of write cycles compared to what SLC would have been capable of if it still existed.
[3958.52 → 3969.74] But, um, great for write once, read many, many times kinds of applications because it will be really cheap.
[3969.74 → 3981.10] So we're talking capacities of up to 96 gigabytes of storage per die, allowing Toshiba to create a 1.5 terabyte SSD package with a 16 die stacked architecture.
[3981.34 → 3985.14] So they're going to demo it at the 2017 Flash Summit in August.
[3985.50 → 3985.64] Woo!
[3985.64 → 3987.48] Uh, there's X299 boards.
[3987.72 → 3988.56] Bad VRM cooling.
[3989.06 → 3989.40] Oh, yeah.
[3989.42 → 3990.64] That's a big sort of thing.
[3990.72 → 3992.00] I think we did tease that.
[3992.16 → 3993.46] So, uh, yeah.
[3994.46 → 3995.84] Uh, we should probably talk about it.
[3995.84 → 3997.18] I've seen these guys' videos before.
[3997.30 → 3999.48] I think you pronounced the channel Debater.
[3999.66 → 4000.16] Yep, Debater.
[4000.24 → 4000.58] I met him.
[4000.68 → 4001.10] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[4001.10 → 4001.32] Yes.
[4001.98 → 4003.00] Good videos, actually.
[4003.22 → 4009.82] But, um, Debater has posted a video showing that the VRMs on an X299 board were reaching 100 degrees
[4009.82 → 4015.88] and the single 8-pin connectors for the power supply can hit 60 degrees when overclocking
[4015.88 → 4016.80] the 10 core models.
[4017.74 → 4018.68] So here's Debater.
[4018.90 → 4019.46] Good guy.
[4019.58 → 4020.54] Pro overclocked.
[4020.76 → 4020.88] Yeah.
[4020.88 → 4025.42] Um, actually makes the Debater deciding tool, which he gave us one of.
[4025.54 → 4025.82] Nice.
[4025.86 → 4026.68] Which is pretty sick.
[4026.84 → 4026.94] Yeah.
[4026.94 → 4035.44] Um, and he has some serious concerns about X299 and how much time the motherboard manufacturers
[4035.44 → 4038.68] had to work on their designs to make sure that they were cooled correctly.
[4038.98 → 4041.36] And not just that, but, um.
[4041.64 → 4043.72] If you're interested in that kind of stuff, go watch his video.
[4043.92 → 4044.62] He does good stuff.
[4044.62 → 4050.52] But given that the motherboard manufacturers also got blind sided by any CPUs with a core
[4050.52 → 4055.34] count over 12, it's not just a matter of being rushed, but also a matter of not having
[4055.34 → 4056.86] enough information potentially.
[4056.94 → 4060.74] To design a board that is actually capable of handling this.
[4061.24 → 4062.72] To be fair, he was testing with one of 10.
[4063.56 → 4063.86] Yes.
[4064.06 → 4064.78] The 10 core models.
[4065.12 → 4065.42] But yeah.
[4065.78 → 4067.62] So it can't get any better.
[4067.84 → 4069.14] It can only get worse.
[4069.22 → 4069.38] Yeah.
[4069.44 → 4070.18] Is sort of the point.
[4070.30 → 4070.44] Yeah.
[4071.52 → 4071.92] Okay.
[4072.32 → 4076.36] There's one more topic we can gloss over it a little bit, but I just want to give some
[4076.36 → 4077.30] people information on it.
[4077.46 → 4077.86] The Amazon one?
[4078.06 → 4078.54] If there were.
[4078.64 → 4078.88] No.
[4079.08 → 4079.52] Oh, okay.
[4080.84 → 4083.10] Um, PETA Ransomware.
[4083.22 → 4083.60] Oh, okay.
[4083.60 → 4088.50] Um, I do really want to give a call-out for the guy on the forum that posted this thread.
[4088.86 → 4097.16] WE groom AK has done a very, very good job of keeping this up to date with perfect
[4097.16 → 4100.06] article linking, perfect quoting, perfect updates.
[4100.06 → 4105.48] Um, condensing big updates on other sites down into easy digestible things.
[4105.48 → 4112.36] So if you're interested in the world of viruses and hacking and ransomware and wipers and
[4112.36 → 4114.88] everything else, definitely go check out this thread.
[4115.02 → 4115.88] I just posted it in the chat.
[4116.76 → 4121.40] Um, and there's a lot of crazy information in there.
[4121.52 → 4123.10] There's a bit of a developing story.
[4123.26 → 4123.52] Yeah.
[4123.60 → 4127.60] So you can maybe if we cover this now and someone watches the show in three days, it's
[4127.60 → 4128.24] not going to be up-to-date.
[4128.24 → 4129.84] All our notes are wrong.
[4129.84 → 4135.38] And not because James is a bad person, but because it has literally all changed.
[4135.46 → 4136.72] It's been changed since he made his notes.
[4136.96 → 4138.46] So, so go check out that thread.
[4138.52 → 4139.34] It's being updated.
[4139.38 → 4144.08] Like it was last updated like slightly over an hour ago.
[4144.16 → 4144.40] Yeah.
[4144.46 → 4149.40] Like after the show was even supposed to start technically before the show started.
[4149.40 → 4153.58] But yeah, um, it's, it's, it's parading as ransomware.
[4153.58 → 4154.84] It's actually a wiper.
[4154.84 → 4160.10] Uh, apparently the email account has been closed by the email hosting service that was
[4160.10 → 4160.52] hosting it.
[4160.56 → 4164.76] So even if you try to pay to get your thing back, they can't receive the email.
[4164.94 → 4168.56] So they're not going to be able to give you a key to unlock your device.
[4168.56 → 4171.80] Like it's, it's, it's a mess right now.
[4171.84 → 4174.08] And if you're really interested in that stuff, I would check out that thread.
[4174.26 → 4176.44] It's, it's very well up to date.
[4176.80 → 4177.40] All right.
[4177.40 → 4181.44] It even includes like the Bitcoin wallet address that people are sending money to.
[4181.44 → 4185.20] So you can see like how much money they've made so far and everything.
[4185.32 → 4186.34] Like it's, yeah, it's good.
[4187.06 → 4187.80] All right.
[4187.90 → 4189.10] So thanks for watching guys.
[4189.10 → 4191.04] And we will see you again next week.
[4191.20 → 4193.56] Same bat time, same bat channel.
[4193.84 → 4194.32] Bye.
[4195.44 → 4197.16] Bow, bow, bow, bow, bow.
[4199.44 → 4200.74] You're like out, out, right?
[4201.16 → 4201.48] Yeah.
[4201.60 → 4201.80] Okay.
[4201.80 → 4212.74] Wendell's wallet.
[4214.86 → 4215.42] Okay.
[4215.94 → 4216.56] It doesn't matter.
[4216.56 → 4217.00] It doesn't matter.
[4217.06 → 4217.80] I'm not trying to hide it.
[4217.94 → 4218.02] It's just.
[4218.02 → 4218.38] Okay.
