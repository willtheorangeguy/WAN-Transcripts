[0.00 --> 4.00]  All right, it's WAN show time again.
[4.00 --> 7.00]  Here, we gotta get our spacing right here. There we go.
[7.00 --> 9.00]  Perfect!
[9.00 --> 11.00]  Oh, man.
[11.00 --> 14.00]  You always push me away from the mic, so you're way louder than me.
[14.00 --> 16.00]  No, I'm way louder than you because I'm way louder than you.
[16.00 --> 21.00]  I push you away from the mic because I'm the one who's actually, you know, looking at the show and...
[21.00 --> 23.00]  Okay, yeah, okay, here, hold on a second.
[23.00 --> 24.00]  We look symmetrical.
[24.00 --> 26.00]  You know what, here, just a second, hold on.
[26.00 --> 27.00]  Let me, let me, let me explain.
[27.00 --> 29.00]  Let me, let me explain something, something here.
[29.00 --> 34.00]  Let's go ahead, we'll, we'll give you guys some screen capture to look at here instead of James.
[34.00 --> 35.00]  There you go.
[35.00 --> 40.00]  Okay, so, uh, oh, that, that really doesn't work very well what I'm doing right now.
[40.00 --> 41.00]  Okay, that's not really the point.
[41.00 --> 43.00]  The point is, look at the distance here.
[43.00 --> 44.00]  See this distance?
[44.00 --> 46.00]  Not enough distance.
[46.00 --> 47.00]  You gotta...
[47.00 --> 48.00]  There.
[51.00 --> 52.00]  See, I'm actually...
[52.00 --> 55.00]  I thought there was a, there was a no mansplaining rule on the WAN show.
[55.00 --> 57.00]  No, no, you're allowed to WAN-splain.
[57.00 --> 58.00]  That's, we've been through this.
[58.00 --> 59.00]  Uh.
[59.00 --> 61.00]  So we've got a lot of great topics for you guys today.
[61.00 --> 63.00]  Topic number one, where is Luke?
[63.00 --> 67.00]  Which is, I'm sure, the only one that you actually care about at this point, because this frickin'-
[67.00 --> 68.00]  Can you take those off?
[68.00 --> 69.00]  I'm not taking them off.
[69.00 --> 71.00]  Oh, you have to take them off.
[71.00 --> 73.00]  Man, I feel like JC Denton.
[73.00 --> 75.00]  He's not using the laser-
[75.00 --> 80.00]  Okay, so, Ed, can you cam up for us for a second here?
[80.00 --> 84.00]  Can you just show them what the heck is going on such that James figures he needs-
[84.00 --> 85.00]  Wow, thank you.
[85.00 --> 88.00]  I'm sure glad I had a professional camera operator do that.
[88.00 --> 89.00]  That's much appreciated.
[89.00 --> 90.00]  That's much appreciated.
[90.00 --> 92.00]  So that right there, look at that.
[92.00 --> 94.00]  He knows how to use the focus ring and everything.
[94.00 --> 96.00]  I'm holding a selfie!
[96.00 --> 97.00]  Yeah!
[97.00 --> 101.00]  So, that right there is our new laser cutter, and these-
[101.00 --> 102.00]  No.
[102.00 --> 103.00]  No!
[103.00 --> 104.00]  You can't wear them the whole show.
[104.00 --> 105.00]  Let me tell you.
[105.00 --> 111.00]  The whole sunglasses during a tech video podcast thing has been done.
[111.00 --> 112.00]  No one likes it.
[112.00 --> 114.00]  My vision is augmented.
[114.00 --> 116.00]  Have you even played Deus Ex?
[116.00 --> 117.00]  This is sick.
[117.00 --> 119.00]  This is harsh.
[119.00 --> 121.00]  I have played- hold on a second.
[121.00 --> 122.00]  Which one is-
[122.00 --> 125.00]  It turns out specific wavelengths, like-
[125.00 --> 128.00]  Yeah, it cuts out all the BS and leaves you with awesome.
[128.00 --> 129.00]  No.
[129.00 --> 130.00]  Can you- no!
[130.00 --> 131.00]  No!
[131.00 --> 134.00]  Can I at least just continually put them on?
[134.00 --> 136.00]  Like periodically throughout the show?
[136.00 --> 140.00]  You can only keep them on for a maximum of 30 seconds at a time.
[140.00 --> 141.00]  Deal.
[141.00 --> 142.00]  Starting-
[142.00 --> 144.00]  Okay, and- and they have a 10 minute cooldown.
[144.00 --> 145.00]  No!
[145.00 --> 146.00]  10 minute cooldown.
[146.00 --> 152.00]  By the way, yes, I have played Deus Ex, but I only played the widely regarded as kind of crap sequel-
[152.00 --> 153.00]  Invisible War.
[153.00 --> 154.00]  Invisible War.
[154.00 --> 160.00]  I actually enjoyed it, having not played the original and never playing one since.
[160.00 --> 162.00]  I- I actually really enjoyed it.
[162.00 --> 163.00]  So-
[163.00 --> 164.00]  Yes, Ed?
[164.00 --> 165.00]  Yeah.
[165.00 --> 166.00]  Do you really, really not want to miss badminton?
[166.00 --> 168.00]  Yeah, I really don't want to miss badminton.
[168.00 --> 170.00]  This guy's trying to send me on a freaking-
[170.00 --> 172.00]  Also, you didn't center our camera.
[172.00 --> 173.00]  Way to go, Ed.
[173.00 --> 175.00]  Or did he?
[175.00 --> 176.00]  No, not quite.
[176.00 --> 178.00]  It needs to go a little bit more towards James.
[178.00 --> 179.00]  Thank you.
[179.00 --> 182.00]  He's trying to send me on a business trip during my badminton night.
[182.00 --> 183.00]  I get one night a week.
[183.00 --> 186.00]  One night a week when I get to go out and do something fun.
[186.00 --> 189.00]  And this guy wants to send me to- where- where are you trying to send me?
[189.00 --> 190.00]  L.A.?
[190.00 --> 191.00]  L.A.?
[191.00 --> 192.00]  L.A.:
[192.00 --> 193.00]  L.A.:
[193.00 --> 194.00]  One syllable cities.
[194.00 --> 195.00]  That's two syllables.
[195.00 --> 197.00]  L.A.:
[197.00 --> 200.00]  L.A.:
[200.00 --> 201.00]  Eeeeeeeeeeeeee.
[201.00 --> 205.82]  All right, so we've got a lot of great topics for you guys today
[208.18 --> 213.46]  Gigabyte responded via email. I hope I hope I hope I can talk about this. I think it was kind of a it was kind of a statement
[213.64 --> 215.64]  so they responded via email to my
[217.60 --> 223.58]  Question about exactly what the heck is going on with motherboard or with coffee lake performance from motherboard to motherboard
[224.06 --> 226.90]  I've also heard from a so we'll be talking a little bit about that
[228.16 --> 230.16]  Activision has patented
[231.00 --> 235.00]  a technique for social engineering
[236.68 --> 239.72]  Microtransactions in games. I love it. It's
[241.78 --> 246.70]  Way more evil than it sounds and it sounds pretty damn evil
[246.94 --> 249.76]  So that should give you some idea. What else we got?
[250.40 --> 255.44]  Oh, I can talk now. Yeah, yeah, yeah, ah reportedly Apple has cut down
[256.32 --> 260.16]  Production of the iPhone 8 for November and December by a large margin
[261.00 --> 268.72]  Cut cut cuts axed and a pixel to XL color issue that Linus may or may not have experienced
[268.72 --> 270.72]  I actually want to know
[270.72 --> 274.60]  I'll get there. You know what? I haven't okay. Yeah, you know what? Why don't we roll the intro?
[274.60 --> 276.60]  We'll talk about it later. We'll talk about it later
[276.60 --> 280.88]  Wancho and it will also do that first topic. I promised where is Luke?
[280.88 --> 288.60]  I'm wearing the sunglasses now with the 30 seconds doesn't count until the intro
[288.60 --> 290.32]  Hey, you have one fan
[290.32 --> 295.76]  Tavor X nine five likes you lots of people like me. Yeah, let's not get ahead of ourselves
[295.76 --> 299.52]  You have one pen. That's not true. Oh, you want me to send you screenshots?
[300.20 --> 302.78]  Dar bullets James just know
[303.60 --> 305.60]  That guy doesn't count
[305.92 --> 309.70]  That's a child die wolf lost. Where is Luke?
[309.70 --> 313.20]  That's because he's pleasantly surprised to see me
[313.70 --> 318.02]  Zen walrus says you're sick and I think he means like disgusting not like good
[318.42 --> 321.18]  Oh, that's both those are both good to me. Those are both good to you
[323.58 --> 329.16]  Sponsors I forgot we were still on the intro the intro screen there
[329.16 --> 332.28]  I don't know how Ed managed it. How hard is this? Okay?
[332.88 --> 334.88]  This much frame
[334.88 --> 339.82]  It's like there's like this much extra. I always tell the camera people I'm like
[340.18 --> 344.32]  Can you center the arm in the frame and they're like yes, and then they don't do it?
[344.32 --> 345.94]  I think they're just messing with me
[345.94 --> 350.40]  I think at this point people are actually just screwing with me when they do things wrong
[352.12 --> 356.52]  All right, so why don't we get into coffee like performance first have you look have you heard about this have you seen this?
[356.52 --> 357.62]  Yes, I read it
[357.62 --> 363.64]  So it comes down to a feature yeah, that is enabled by default on some boards, but not enabled by default on others
[363.64 --> 372.00]  Yeah, so a susa statement was actually I'm gonna have a quick look at my email here and make sure that this is on the record
[373.94 --> 375.44]  because
[375.44 --> 378.36]  it's one of those frustrating things where sometimes we actually
[379.56 --> 381.56]  we actually know
[381.74 --> 383.76]  more than we can say because
[384.44 --> 390.98]  Industry contacts don't want to get themselves in trouble mind you there's a pretty funny story actually about a sus and
[390.98 --> 396.44]  And being sort of on the record when you thought you weren't on the record no no no I'm on it
[396.68 --> 398.98]  No, put them on I'm not going to put them here
[399.68 --> 404.10]  Being on the record when you didn't realize you're on the record and saying something that kind of threw Intel under the bus
[404.10 --> 406.10]  We'll get to that later, but
[406.10 --> 407.38]  First up yes
[407.38 --> 412.28]  I actually asked do you guys have an official statement on the whole auto overclocking thing so the whole discrepancy
[413.30 --> 417.74]  between it was especially visible and heavily multi-threaded tests like Cinebench
[417.74 --> 423.94]  between you know one reviewers results with coffee lake and another's where people were getting up to like
[424.32 --> 426.16]  300 point differences in Cinebench
[426.46 --> 431.02]  Seems to have come down to some motherboard manufacturers most notably asus
[431.50 --> 435.10]  enabling a feature by default on their boards that
[435.96 --> 437.12]  effectively
[437.12 --> 438.96]  Over clocks the CPU
[438.96 --> 450.32]  Right out of the box running all of the cores at the maximum turbo rather than just one or two or however many were supposed to be enabled at that particular speed
[450.66 --> 453.38]  So I asked and this is my subject line
[453.38 --> 459.68]  So I think I have absolved myself of any responsibility for this being something that can't go out to the public for an official statement
[459.68 --> 462.56]  From asus on the whole auto overclocking thing
[462.56 --> 466.44]  But I actually you know what I should probably talk about gigabyte statement first
[466.44 --> 470.80]  So they proactively sent this to me and they're basically just like good luck
[471.06 --> 476.36]  No, no, I can read this they're basically just like hey, I just watched your WAN show
[476.96 --> 482.16]  That's that's cool gigabyte watches the WAN show like you guys are the WAN show you guys make the news
[482.16 --> 484.16]  I'm just like blah blah blah like this about it
[484.74 --> 487.10]  Just wanted to comment on the variance in scores
[487.10 --> 491.54]  There's been some discussion over Intel turbo policy and enhanced multi-core performance
[491.54 --> 495.72]  I'm sure you are aware this is a feature that pegs all cores at the max turbo frequency
[495.72 --> 500.22]  So in the case of the 8700k this is 4.7 gigahertz across all cores
[500.56 --> 506.04]  Now something that's really happened over the last couple of generations of Intel's turbo boost technology
[506.04 --> 511.86]  Is that the difference between base clock and max turbo clock has increased a lot
[511.86 --> 518.32]  So it used to be that if you had a multi-core enhancement feature and you just boosted everything it was just a little bit
[518.32 --> 524.92]  And the reason they've done that is so they can get higher efficiency better battery life stuff like higher efficiency CPUs overall
[524.92 --> 527.76]  Yeah, basically so the idea is that Intel's going okay
[527.76 --> 531.10]  Well, here's what we're comfortable rating it for when all the cores are operating and
[531.74 --> 536.40]  We want to tune it better and better and better for lightly threaded workloads
[536.40 --> 541.68]  So you can get more performance out of just like a game that only utilizes one or two cores
[541.68 --> 545.16]  Or any other single threaded application so you can
[545.16 --> 554.34]  But they wouldn't have rated the CPU for 4.7 gigahertz on all the cores at the thermal and at the power consumption targets that they have
[554.34 --> 559.56]  So there's going to be a stability issue there and that's what this person from gigabyte is hinting at
[559.56 --> 559.80]  Yeah
[559.80 --> 562.32]  The reason they don't don't put it on by default
[562.32 --> 566.72]  There's potential for a stability issue because it is in effect overclocking
[566.72 --> 567.92]  Or just heat
[567.92 --> 577.60]  And it produces more heat and so this is why our 8700k review had our chip consuming a lot of power compared to what we might have expected
[577.60 --> 579.94]  And we probably should have investigated that further
[579.94 --> 581.30]  So we were using an Asus board
[581.30 --> 582.62]  We were using an Asus board
[582.62 --> 587.82]  So we've typically used Asus boards for our launch coverage of any new CPU for
[587.82 --> 592.58]  I don't know the last five five or six CPU launches
[592.58 --> 598.96]  See how he drinks water to buy himself time
[598.96 --> 601.00]  I drink Asus water
[601.00 --> 601.54]  But
[601.54 --> 609.02]  The reality of it is that we've found it has really more to do with the pre-review support for us
[609.02 --> 614.36]  The fact that we can email anytime night or day and we're getting a response within like 20 minutes
[614.36 --> 620.16]  And that has really made our lives a lot easier when we're trying to iron out what are often
[620.16 --> 624.22]  Bugs with the CPU with the RAM with the board
[624.22 --> 630.62]  Being able to get new bioses that address these or get answers when there is no bios to address it
[630.62 --> 633.70]  Helps us out a lot and that's the main reason that we've been doing that
[633.70 --> 638.62]  So we were running the board at default
[638.62 --> 640.04]  Which we assumed was kind of okay
[640.04 --> 643.58]  So here's my response from Asus
[643.58 --> 644.86]  Well
[644.86 --> 647.74]  We've been doing it that way for a few years
[647.74 --> 649.80]  So they're basically saying like
[649.80 --> 651.40]  Hey this isn't really anything new
[651.40 --> 654.48]  So I really don't know what there is to say
[654.48 --> 657.04]  We
[657.04 --> 659.24]  The motherboard makers in general
[659.24 --> 660.26]  This is kind of the statement
[660.26 --> 661.88]  We get slammed for enabling it
[661.88 --> 664.26]  Then we all disable it
[664.26 --> 666.78]  Then we get slammed for not doing it
[666.78 --> 668.36]  Because it's kind of free performance
[668.36 --> 670.08]  And kind of within spec
[670.08 --> 672.52]  Then we place warnings on enabling it
[672.52 --> 673.46]  And that gets ignored
[673.46 --> 677.38]  So I guess now we're back to not enabling it
[677.38 --> 680.26]  With some new bios updates next week
[680.26 --> 683.08]  Do you have an opinion on whether or not they should enable it?
[683.42 --> 684.56]  I'm standing here I think
[684.56 --> 686.18]  You should have it off by default
[686.18 --> 688.02]  It's still a feature that's included
[688.02 --> 690.66]  Is it just a switch you turn on in the bios?
[690.66 --> 692.18]  So it's easy to do
[692.18 --> 694.08]  If people
[694.08 --> 695.38]  As long as people know about it
[695.38 --> 697.54]  That you're not losing out on that free performance
[697.54 --> 699.50]  You still have it available to you if you want it
[699.50 --> 701.34]  But how would people know about it?
[701.36 --> 703.04]  I would argue that the average user
[703.04 --> 705.86]  Even the average user who builds their own computer
[705.86 --> 709.40]  Isn't going to touch a feature called multi-core enhancement
[709.40 --> 711.32]  Sounds pretty sweet to me
[711.32 --> 712.56]  Yeah it sounds pretty sweet
[712.56 --> 714.88]  But there's also like a lot of stuff within a bios
[714.88 --> 716.92]  That might seem sweet on the surface
[716.92 --> 718.48]  But you turn it on
[718.48 --> 720.36]  And your computer doesn't boot anymore
[720.36 --> 721.46]  Until you, you know
[721.46 --> 723.06]  Because remember you're a novice user
[723.06 --> 724.34]  You go into your manual
[724.34 --> 728.32]  You figure out what the hell a CMOS reset is
[728.32 --> 730.94]  You go find that stupid button or header
[730.94 --> 733.06]  And you know 15 minutes
[733.06 --> 733.94]  30 minutes later
[733.94 --> 735.08]  You've got your computer back on
[735.08 --> 735.42]  You kind of go
[735.42 --> 737.16]  Whoa I'm not going to touch any of that stuff anymore
[737.16 --> 738.28]  It would come down to marketing
[738.28 --> 741.60]  But you can't market something that's just
[741.60 --> 745.00]  I mean I guess you kind of
[745.00 --> 746.18]  You can
[746.18 --> 747.88]  But they don't want you using that anyway
[747.88 --> 750.14]  Like if you're Asus or Gigabyte or MSI
[750.14 --> 752.34]  They've all got auto overclocking tools
[752.34 --> 755.14]  That are much more sophisticated than that
[755.14 --> 756.24]  Built into their boards
[756.24 --> 757.92]  That are like turning up the speed
[757.92 --> 759.20]  Testing it to make sure it's okay
[759.20 --> 760.02]  Turning it up some more
[760.02 --> 760.80]  Testing it again
[760.80 --> 762.62]  And they want you using that stuff
[762.62 --> 765.38]  So how do those features reconcile with this feature?
[765.66 --> 766.72]  If you have them both on
[766.72 --> 768.92]  It's a good question
[768.92 --> 771.08]  Truthfully haven't played around with it a whole lot
[771.08 --> 774.92]  So honestly I don't really plan to
[774.92 --> 778.56]  Because I don't really personally recommend either of them
[778.56 --> 780.08]  As the most optimal way to overclock
[780.08 --> 782.48]  I still believe that doing it manually yourself
[782.48 --> 784.46]  Is the best way to overclock
[784.46 --> 788.88]  So yeah
[788.88 --> 791.32]  Apparently we're slightly out of focus
[791.32 --> 793.86]  I just I don't even I don't even know
[793.86 --> 795.64]  I don't even know why we have camera people anymore
[795.64 --> 798.22]  Speaking of which
[798.22 --> 800.00]  I need a camera person right now
[800.00 --> 803.14]  Oh Alex is taking the wheel
[803.14 --> 803.94]  Oh wow
[803.94 --> 804.46]  Taking
[804.46 --> 805.10]  Wow
[805.10 --> 805.96]  The focus wheel
[805.96 --> 807.74]  Hey actually that's not bad
[807.74 --> 808.38]  Damn girl
[808.38 --> 809.72]  That's not
[809.72 --> 809.84]  That's not
[809.84 --> 813.00]  You should have seen the celly you just did
[813.00 --> 813.60]  I can't do it
[813.60 --> 814.14]  But he did that
[814.14 --> 814.56]  Okay
[814.56 --> 816.78]  Come show them that weird thing that you do
[816.78 --> 817.62]  Give us the celly
[817.62 --> 819.94]  It weirds me out
[819.94 --> 823.84]  I like that you only do it twice
[823.84 --> 826.94]  Well you can do it more but it just gets weird after that
[826.94 --> 828.22]  Alright
[828.22 --> 829.70]  Are we on to the next one?
[830.04 --> 832.14]  Yeah let's move on to the next topic here
[832.14 --> 833.50]  Activision
[833.50 --> 834.40]  No I don't want to do that topic
[834.40 --> 835.38]  Oh I do though
[835.38 --> 837.12]  Yeah we'll do that topic
[837.12 --> 837.98]  Alright alright alright
[837.98 --> 838.54]  We'll talk about it
[838.54 --> 842.62]  So this was originally posted by WM Groom AK on the forum
[842.62 --> 846.12]  The original article here is actually from Rolling Stone of all publications
[846.12 --> 847.66]  Well there was a more original one
[847.66 --> 849.98]  But the site had that slideshow format
[849.98 --> 851.44]  So I wasn't messing with that
[851.44 --> 851.94]  Okay
[851.94 --> 853.30]  So James
[853.30 --> 854.92]  How
[854.92 --> 860.50]  On a scale of 1 to AIDS plus cancer plus leprosy
[860.50 --> 862.28]  Where would you put
[862.28 --> 864.98]  Activision's research
[864.98 --> 868.56]  Into using matchmaking tricks
[868.56 --> 870.22]  So you guys know in-game matchmaking
[870.22 --> 872.08]  Like pairing one party with another
[872.08 --> 874.66]  Using in-game matchmaking tricks
[874.66 --> 877.52]  To sell in-game items
[877.52 --> 878.86]  If I work there
[878.86 --> 881.00]  If I'm an executive or a shareholder
[881.00 --> 882.74]  This is awesome
[882.74 --> 883.88]  Do you own shares
[883.88 --> 884.52]  So sick
[884.52 --> 885.34]  In Activision
[885.34 --> 886.22]  No I don't
[886.22 --> 888.12]  Okay so then how do you feel about it now?
[888.12 --> 889.32]  From a gaming perspective
[889.32 --> 891.56]  It's all over folks
[891.56 --> 892.46]  Throw in the towel
[892.46 --> 894.56]  Games suck from now on
[894.56 --> 897.74]  This is a brutal direction for developers to go
[897.74 --> 898.66]  There is some good news
[898.66 --> 900.54]  They've actually patented the technique
[900.54 --> 902.06]  So not all games suck
[902.06 --> 903.60]  Hopefully no one else can do this
[903.60 --> 907.12]  Just all the huge major titles from this giant company
[907.12 --> 909.02]  So okay let's get into this
[909.02 --> 911.36]  Activision was granted a patent this month
[911.36 --> 915.14]  For a system it uses to influence players in multiplayer games
[915.14 --> 918.30]  To purchase game items through microtransactions
[918.30 --> 919.84]  So the system uses
[919.84 --> 922.10]  It alters the matchmaking process
[922.10 --> 924.72]  So typically players are put into games together
[924.72 --> 926.20]  Based on a wide variety of factors
[926.20 --> 927.48]  Including skill level
[927.48 --> 928.66]  Internet latency
[928.66 --> 930.26]  And your availability of friends
[930.26 --> 931.46]  And that's the way it should be
[931.46 --> 934.40]  You should be skilled so that everyone's playing
[934.40 --> 937.40]  A fun round of you know
[937.40 --> 939.36]  Counter go source
[939.36 --> 941.60]  Or whatever it is that the kids are playing these days
[941.60 --> 942.96]  Right but now they've added this
[942.96 --> 943.82]  You know runecraft
[943.82 --> 944.86]  Extra vector
[944.86 --> 945.68]  Yeah
[945.68 --> 947.06]  This extra vector of
[947.06 --> 948.64]  Into the matchmaking process
[948.64 --> 951.92]  That basically tries to get you in the game
[951.92 --> 953.88]  With people who have bought stuff
[953.88 --> 954.84]  That you haven't bought yet
[954.84 --> 956.02]  So that psychologically
[956.02 --> 958.22]  You kind of see them using it
[958.22 --> 959.16]  And you want to buy it
[959.16 --> 960.70]  And it also
[960.70 --> 961.44]  So the
[961.44 --> 963.80]  The article also describes
[963.80 --> 964.92]  Part of the technique
[964.92 --> 967.82]  Being to take inexperienced players
[967.82 --> 971.68]  And intentionally put them in close proximity
[971.68 --> 974.46]  To players who are good at a skill
[974.46 --> 976.28]  That they aspire to be good at
[976.28 --> 978.66]  And who have an item
[978.66 --> 980.18]  That appears to be related to that skill
[980.18 --> 981.60]  So let's say that
[981.60 --> 983.18]  A really skilled player
[983.18 --> 985.54]  Has like a great sniper rifle
[985.54 --> 986.32]  For example
[986.32 --> 989.94]  Then they're gonna pair this player
[989.94 --> 990.24]  Who
[990.24 --> 993.54]  And you can tell so much about people
[993.54 --> 995.54]  From the way that they game actually
[995.54 --> 996.88]  Well I mean you can tell a lot about
[996.88 --> 998.22]  How they want to game
[998.22 --> 999.56]  Anyway so if someone's like
[999.56 --> 1001.12]  Always playing sniper classes
[1001.12 --> 1002.68]  But sucks
[1002.68 --> 1004.02]  You can tell
[1004.02 --> 1005.28]  I don't even think it's skill level
[1005.28 --> 1006.40]  Aspire to be a sniper
[1006.40 --> 1006.98]  No no
[1006.98 --> 1007.96]  Well there's that too
[1007.96 --> 1010.04]  There's multiple aspects of it
[1010.04 --> 1010.26]  Right
[1010.26 --> 1012.64]  So they'll take like an unskilled sniper
[1012.64 --> 1014.32]  Who wants to be good at sniping
[1014.32 --> 1016.16]  They'll put them near
[1016.16 --> 1017.42]  A good sniper
[1017.42 --> 1019.04]  Who has great equipment
[1019.04 --> 1020.82]  Like hat of plus one
[1020.82 --> 1022.04]  That they paid for
[1022.04 --> 1022.40]  Sniper bot
[1022.40 --> 1022.74]  Or whatever
[1022.74 --> 1023.88]  Premium stuff that they paid for
[1023.88 --> 1024.82]  That they paid for
[1024.82 --> 1025.94]  And
[1025.94 --> 1027.24]  Kind of
[1027.24 --> 1028.30]  Watch
[1028.30 --> 1029.08]  Right
[1029.08 --> 1029.78]  And then
[1029.78 --> 1031.54]  Continually retool it
[1031.54 --> 1032.66]  And re-optimize
[1032.66 --> 1034.42]  To get more people
[1034.42 --> 1035.54]  Buying microtransactions
[1035.54 --> 1036.76]  If my children
[1036.76 --> 1038.44]  Ever
[1038.44 --> 1040.68]  Pay for an in-game item
[1040.68 --> 1043.10]  I'm cutting them off
[1043.10 --> 1044.00]  They're out of the will
[1044.00 --> 1044.94]  They're gonna be out dude
[1044.94 --> 1045.80]  They're out of the will
[1045.80 --> 1046.94]  That's gonna happen really soon
[1046.94 --> 1048.44]  You guys heard it here first
[1048.44 --> 1049.96]  Out of the will
[1049.96 --> 1050.58]  Can I get in there?
[1050.92 --> 1052.14]  Because digital
[1052.14 --> 1054.24]  Like in-game items
[1054.24 --> 1056.50]  I don't know
[1056.50 --> 1057.30]  See we're old school
[1057.30 --> 1058.22]  It can be kind of cool
[1058.22 --> 1059.52]  We used to just buy a game
[1059.52 --> 1060.64]  And have the whole game
[1060.64 --> 1062.14]  Then expansion packs came out
[1062.14 --> 1063.48]  And that was just bonus and awesome
[1063.48 --> 1064.84]  Then it all went to shit
[1064.84 --> 1065.72]  And now it's
[1065.72 --> 1066.00]  Poo
[1066.00 --> 1067.04]  We don't swear on the wansho
[1067.04 --> 1068.44]  DLC is just like
[1068.44 --> 1069.94]  How you get the whole game
[1069.94 --> 1070.36]  Okay
[1070.36 --> 1070.92]  Hold on
[1070.92 --> 1071.18]  Hold on
[1071.18 --> 1073.20]  So what I realized
[1073.20 --> 1073.94]  When I was talking about
[1073.94 --> 1075.02]  Cutting my kids out of the will
[1075.02 --> 1076.22]  Is that
[1076.22 --> 1079.08]  I think I've actually
[1079.08 --> 1081.04]  Bought digital items before
[1081.04 --> 1082.08]  Shh
[1082.08 --> 1083.34]  They don't know
[1083.34 --> 1084.06]  I know
[1084.06 --> 1084.62]  I know
[1084.62 --> 1086.30]  So they won't be cut out of the will
[1086.30 --> 1087.12]  But but but
[1087.12 --> 1089.28]  If they spend too much on them
[1089.28 --> 1090.46]  What's too much?
[1090.50 --> 1091.36]  Then they're cut out of the will
[1091.36 --> 1092.52]  That can be written in the will?
[1092.74 --> 1093.38]  Too much is
[1093.38 --> 1094.70]  Yeah too much is
[1094.70 --> 1095.62]  You know
[1095.62 --> 1096.30]  I think
[1096.30 --> 1097.76]  I think more than
[1097.76 --> 1099.48]  You know what?
[1099.52 --> 1101.36]  That is a really good straw poll question
[1101.36 --> 1103.18]  Once
[1103.18 --> 1103.64]  Okay
[1103.64 --> 1104.52]  So I want to
[1104.52 --> 1105.34]  I want to frame this
[1105.34 --> 1107.02]  In a pretty specific manner
[1107.02 --> 1108.52]  Because there's a couple of different ways
[1108.52 --> 1109.50]  You can define too much
[1109.50 --> 1110.08]  Like
[1110.08 --> 1111.52]  I would take
[1111.52 --> 1112.82]  A free to play game
[1112.82 --> 1113.66]  Where
[1113.66 --> 1114.96]  The in game items
[1114.96 --> 1115.96]  Are purely cosmetic
[1115.96 --> 1118.10]  And it's not a pay to win
[1118.10 --> 1119.68]  And I would kind of look at it
[1119.68 --> 1120.14]  And I would go
[1120.14 --> 1120.98]  You know what?
[1121.18 --> 1122.24]  Buying a skin or two
[1122.24 --> 1124.08]  Or a character here and there
[1124.08 --> 1126.08]  To support the developer
[1126.08 --> 1127.52]  Who's running a free to play game
[1127.52 --> 1129.50]  But has a lot of costs associated with it
[1129.50 --> 1129.90]  Big time
[1129.90 --> 1130.80]  Probably
[1130.80 --> 1131.70]  Okay
[1131.70 --> 1133.16]  But
[1133.16 --> 1135.12]  If we're talking triple A title
[1135.12 --> 1137.40]  Like we're talking like a 69.99
[1137.40 --> 1137.94]  Oh yeah
[1137.94 --> 1139.92]  79.99 triple A title
[1139.92 --> 1140.54]  Or
[1140.54 --> 1141.64]  Or worse yet
[1141.64 --> 1144.14]  Like a collector's edition that came in a tin
[1144.14 --> 1147.74]  So you've like already spent 130, 150 bucks on this thing
[1147.74 --> 1148.68]  And
[1148.68 --> 1150.56]  You can't even put the Master Chief helmet on
[1150.56 --> 1151.42]  Because it's actually mini
[1151.42 --> 1152.10]  Right
[1152.10 --> 1153.12]  And you run out
[1153.12 --> 1153.80]  And you blow
[1153.80 --> 1155.62]  Like another 50 bucks
[1155.62 --> 1156.78]  100 bucks on it
[1156.78 --> 1158.08]  I think that is
[1158.08 --> 1158.84]  Totally
[1158.84 --> 1159.92]  Different
[1159.92 --> 1161.70]  So I want to create
[1161.70 --> 1163.42]  A specific scenario for you guys
[1163.42 --> 1164.22]  Because we're talking
[1164.22 --> 1165.42]  Activision Blizzard here
[1165.42 --> 1167.58]  So we are not talking about
[1167.58 --> 1168.42]  Free to play games
[1168.42 --> 1169.28]  Okay
[1169.28 --> 1170.04]  You pay for the game
[1170.04 --> 1171.60]  So
[1171.60 --> 1172.52]  So let's say
[1172.52 --> 1174.02]  Let's say a $50 game
[1174.02 --> 1175.14]  Just for the sake of argument
[1175.14 --> 1175.38]  Okay
[1175.38 --> 1176.54]  And I know that's
[1176.54 --> 1178.36]  Almost nothing is 50 bucks anymore
[1178.36 --> 1179.24]  It's either more
[1179.24 --> 1180.10]  Because it's triple A
[1180.10 --> 1180.76]  Or it's like
[1180.76 --> 1181.94]  20, 30 bucks
[1181.94 --> 1182.82]  Because it's indie
[1182.82 --> 1183.86]  But let's say
[1183.86 --> 1184.82]  $50 game
[1184.82 --> 1186.78]  Acceptable amount
[1186.78 --> 1187.44]  To spend
[1187.44 --> 1189.22]  On microtransactions
[1189.22 --> 1190.40]  I think you should attach
[1190.40 --> 1191.22]  A time frame here
[1191.22 --> 1192.58]  Because if I'm playing
[1192.58 --> 1193.28]  Wow
[1193.28 --> 1194.54]  For like six years
[1194.54 --> 1195.50]  And I spend
[1195.50 --> 1195.88]  $300
[1195.88 --> 1197.12]  Whatever
[1197.12 --> 1198.54]  But if this is a period
[1198.54 --> 1199.10]  Of six months
[1199.10 --> 1199.88]  Or something like that
[1199.88 --> 1200.24]  Okay
[1200.24 --> 1201.64]  Yeah that's fair
[1201.64 --> 1202.54]  Per year
[1202.54 --> 1203.00]  First year
[1203.00 --> 1203.20]  Okay
[1203.20 --> 1203.90]  Let's do per year
[1203.90 --> 1204.38]  Okay
[1204.38 --> 1205.04]  So first
[1205.04 --> 1206.58]  For you hardcores out there
[1206.58 --> 1208.04]  I'm putting in the $0 option
[1208.04 --> 1208.32]  Okay
[1208.32 --> 1208.84]  Don't worry
[1208.84 --> 1210.10]  I'm putting in the $0 option
[1210.10 --> 1210.90]  Okay
[1210.90 --> 1212.40]  Hardcores or cheapskates
[1212.40 --> 1214.40]  Okay
[1214.40 --> 1215.66]  So I've got
[1215.66 --> 1218.60]  Okay
[1218.60 --> 1219.32]  While you set that up
[1219.32 --> 1219.88]  I want to talk about
[1219.88 --> 1221.56]  Another thing that this algorithm does
[1221.56 --> 1222.74]  That just even
[1222.74 --> 1224.14]  Just takes it to the next level
[1224.14 --> 1225.82]  Once you do
[1225.82 --> 1226.82]  Make an in-game purchase
[1226.82 --> 1228.00]  So they put you in a match
[1228.00 --> 1228.94]  With the expert sniper
[1228.94 --> 1231.14]  You were totally attracted to it
[1231.14 --> 1231.92]  You ended up buying
[1231.92 --> 1232.86]  This sniper rifle
[1232.86 --> 1234.28]  Once you made that purchase
[1234.28 --> 1236.06]  They're then going to take
[1236.06 --> 1238.00]  Actions that make you feel
[1238.00 --> 1239.28]  Good about that purchase
[1239.28 --> 1240.12]  They don't want you
[1240.12 --> 1241.18]  To regret the purchase
[1241.18 --> 1242.76]  So on your next match
[1242.76 --> 1243.70]  They're going to put you
[1243.70 --> 1244.32]  In a game
[1244.32 --> 1246.10]  Where you're not
[1246.10 --> 1247.20]  In a close quarters match
[1247.20 --> 1247.78]  You're going to be put
[1247.78 --> 1248.56]  In a game where that
[1248.56 --> 1249.76]  Purchase is advantageous
[1249.76 --> 1250.26]  They're going to put you
[1250.26 --> 1251.28]  In blood gulch or whatever
[1251.28 --> 1253.06]  A sniper friendly match
[1253.06 --> 1253.62]  So you can actually
[1253.62 --> 1255.06]  When's the last time
[1255.06 --> 1255.96]  You played video games
[1255.96 --> 1256.56]  That's old school man
[1256.56 --> 1257.64]  People like the show
[1257.64 --> 1259.12]  I know it's old school
[1259.12 --> 1260.28]  They like the throwbacks
[1260.28 --> 1261.82]  I know what it is
[1261.82 --> 1262.26]  Hell yeah
[1262.26 --> 1263.76]  Which means it's old school
[1263.76 --> 1265.42]  That's a classic
[1265.42 --> 1266.00]  Blood gulch
[1266.00 --> 1266.86]  I know what it is
[1266.86 --> 1267.48]  They made that map
[1267.48 --> 1268.36]  Four different times
[1268.36 --> 1269.56]  It's in every game
[1269.56 --> 1270.38]  Every halo game
[1270.38 --> 1271.42]  Okay anyway
[1271.42 --> 1272.14]  They're going to put you
[1272.14 --> 1273.16]  In blood gulch
[1273.16 --> 1273.76]  Into a map
[1273.76 --> 1275.52]  Twitch chat is flipping out
[1275.52 --> 1276.70]  To blood gulch
[1276.70 --> 1277.58]  They love it
[1277.58 --> 1278.34]  Wow
[1278.34 --> 1280.12]  It's the last online halo game
[1280.12 --> 1280.70]  Can you
[1280.70 --> 1281.24]  Aww
[1281.24 --> 1282.14]  Aww
[1282.14 --> 1282.66]  Okay
[1282.66 --> 1283.06]  Okay
[1283.06 --> 1284.40]  Go go go go go
[1284.40 --> 1285.00]  Fire James
[1285.00 --> 1285.62]  Fire James
[1285.62 --> 1286.40]  Okay
[1286.40 --> 1286.94]  Fire that guy
[1286.94 --> 1287.52]  Is too young to know
[1287.52 --> 1288.12]  What blood gulch is
[1288.12 --> 1289.46]  You should be getting
[1289.46 --> 1290.70]  An xbox on ebay
[1290.70 --> 1291.86]  Just so you can play it
[1291.86 --> 1293.28]  Even if you weren't born yet
[1293.28 --> 1294.64]  Anyway
[1294.64 --> 1295.30]  We need
[1295.30 --> 1296.62]  A linus tech tips
[1296.62 --> 1297.62]  Halo 1 server
[1297.62 --> 1298.36]  Booyah
[1298.36 --> 1298.76]  Agreed
[1298.76 --> 1299.60]  That'd be sweet
[1299.60 --> 1300.26]  Okay
[1300.26 --> 1302.02]  You guys
[1302.02 --> 1302.98]  You guys would be down
[1302.98 --> 1304.32]  I'm like still playing it
[1304.32 --> 1306.32]  Okay I'm not so old school
[1306.32 --> 1307.50]  That I am advocating
[1307.50 --> 1308.72]  Using like the original
[1308.72 --> 1309.56]  Fatty controller
[1309.56 --> 1310.52]  That controller sucked
[1310.52 --> 1311.36]  You're allowed to use
[1311.36 --> 1312.54]  The x controller
[1312.54 --> 1313.32]  Shill gulch
[1313.32 --> 1314.20]  Shill gulch
[1314.20 --> 1315.12]  Shill gulch
[1315.12 --> 1316.68]  You know halo 1
[1316.68 --> 1317.50]  Is still like $30
[1317.50 --> 1318.64]  Gulch tips
[1318.64 --> 1319.80]  You can still buy it
[1319.80 --> 1320.90]  Halo 1 custom edition
[1320.90 --> 1321.46]  Is $30
[1321.46 --> 1322.86]  It's like the first game
[1322.86 --> 1323.54]  That I've torrented
[1323.54 --> 1324.18]  In forever
[1324.18 --> 1325.16]  I was like I'm not paying
[1325.16 --> 1326.16]  $30 for this
[1326.16 --> 1327.42]  It's terrible
[1327.42 --> 1328.74]  Terrible
[1328.74 --> 1330.62]  Okay alright
[1330.62 --> 1332.02]  I'm gonna let you finish
[1332.02 --> 1332.72]  I'm gonna let you finish
[1332.72 --> 1332.98]  But
[1332.98 --> 1334.30]  Basically the thing
[1334.30 --> 1335.34]  That sucks about this
[1335.34 --> 1336.36]  Is that you can tell
[1336.36 --> 1336.94]  From the language
[1336.94 --> 1337.50]  And the patent
[1337.50 --> 1338.84]  That this is not just
[1338.84 --> 1340.18]  Going to be affecting
[1340.18 --> 1341.52]  In game purchases
[1341.52 --> 1342.30]  Like skins
[1342.30 --> 1343.18]  And aesthetic things
[1343.18 --> 1343.40]  Yeah
[1343.40 --> 1344.38]  The language talks
[1344.38 --> 1344.96]  About weapons
[1344.96 --> 1346.06]  And that just means
[1346.06 --> 1346.62]  That the developers
[1346.62 --> 1347.28]  Are gonna have
[1347.28 --> 1348.26]  A monetary incentive
[1348.26 --> 1349.70]  To make it play to win
[1349.70 --> 1350.84]  So to me
[1350.84 --> 1351.60]  That just looks like
[1351.60 --> 1352.62]  This is the direction
[1352.62 --> 1353.16]  We're all going
[1353.16 --> 1353.84]  The thing about
[1353.84 --> 1355.22]  This kind of play to win
[1355.22 --> 1356.78]  Is it's like a sicker
[1356.78 --> 1359.10]  More insidious play to win
[1359.10 --> 1361.72]  Because instead of it being
[1361.72 --> 1362.14]  Okay
[1362.14 --> 1363.22]  Instead of it being
[1363.22 --> 1364.26]  Or did I say play to win
[1364.26 --> 1364.70]  Pay to win
[1364.70 --> 1366.22]  Instead of me being able
[1366.22 --> 1367.16]  To pay more
[1367.16 --> 1368.46]  To just have
[1368.46 --> 1369.94]  Better crap than you
[1369.94 --> 1371.74]  And walk in and stomp you
[1371.74 --> 1373.34]  I have to lose to you
[1373.34 --> 1373.86]  Hold on
[1373.86 --> 1374.90]  It'll be
[1374.90 --> 1375.60]  It'll be
[1375.60 --> 1376.64]  Pay more
[1376.64 --> 1379.18]  And get a
[1379.18 --> 1381.04]  Faco ego boost
[1381.04 --> 1382.26]  Because they're just
[1382.26 --> 1383.42]  Gonna pair you
[1383.42 --> 1385.18]  With crappier players
[1385.18 --> 1386.84]  I can imagine
[1386.84 --> 1387.36]  That when they
[1387.36 --> 1388.28]  First roll this out
[1388.28 --> 1389.36]  They're gonna trick you
[1389.36 --> 1390.16]  When they first
[1390.16 --> 1390.68]  Roll this out
[1390.68 --> 1391.14]  You're gonna be
[1391.14 --> 1391.82]  On the team
[1391.82 --> 1392.42]  You're gonna be
[1392.42 --> 1393.06]  On the same team
[1393.06 --> 1393.50]  As the guy
[1393.50 --> 1394.40]  With the awesome gun
[1394.40 --> 1395.38]  But then they're
[1395.38 --> 1395.92]  Gonna find out
[1395.92 --> 1396.54]  That it's actually
[1396.54 --> 1397.16]  More effective
[1397.16 --> 1397.66]  If you're on
[1397.66 --> 1398.40]  The opposite team
[1398.40 --> 1398.94]  And you just get
[1398.94 --> 1400.02]  Lit up by this guy
[1400.02 --> 1400.60]  With the awesome gun
[1400.60 --> 1401.38]  You're tired of
[1401.38 --> 1402.94]  Getting so pwned
[1402.94 --> 1404.44]  That you go
[1404.44 --> 1404.96]  And buy the gun
[1404.96 --> 1405.38]  Yourself
[1405.38 --> 1406.38]  And then you get
[1406.38 --> 1406.94]  To the awesome
[1406.94 --> 1407.90]  Feeling of wrecking noobs
[1407.90 --> 1409.08]  I mean at what point
[1409.08 --> 1410.08]  Do they then
[1410.08 --> 1411.20]  Take it a step further
[1411.20 --> 1412.14]  And they start
[1412.14 --> 1413.58]  Actually fooling you
[1413.58 --> 1414.28]  Into thinking
[1414.28 --> 1414.76]  You're playing
[1414.76 --> 1415.40]  Against people
[1415.40 --> 1415.88]  You're not
[1415.88 --> 1417.04]  Like what if
[1417.04 --> 1418.02]  They could use
[1418.02 --> 1420.04]  Like a neural network
[1420.04 --> 1420.92]  To figure out
[1420.92 --> 1422.24]  Which people in game
[1422.24 --> 1423.64]  You actually know
[1423.64 --> 1425.06]  And which people
[1425.06 --> 1425.88]  You don't
[1425.88 --> 1427.00]  So they could have
[1427.00 --> 1427.88]  You playing against
[1427.88 --> 1428.28]  The guy
[1428.28 --> 1429.04]  You're playing against
[1429.04 --> 1429.78]  The guy who's
[1429.78 --> 1430.74]  Ripping you apart
[1430.74 --> 1431.60]  With a sniper rifle
[1431.60 --> 1432.30]  From the other side
[1432.30 --> 1432.70]  Of the map
[1432.70 --> 1433.42]  Okay
[1433.42 --> 1434.84]  Um
[1434.84 --> 1436.08]  Or the guy that like
[1436.08 --> 1437.16]  Literally gets out
[1437.16 --> 1437.86]  Of the banshee
[1437.86 --> 1438.68]  And like manages
[1438.68 --> 1439.62]  To drop it on you
[1439.62 --> 1440.14]  Every time
[1440.14 --> 1440.56]  Oh
[1440.56 --> 1442.14]  Terrible
[1442.14 --> 1442.98]  It's all halo
[1442.98 --> 1443.42]  All the time
[1443.42 --> 1443.88]  It's all halo
[1443.88 --> 1444.38]  All the time
[1444.38 --> 1445.04]  From now on
[1445.04 --> 1445.30]  Okay
[1445.30 --> 1446.16]  Um
[1446.16 --> 1447.72]  And then in your
[1447.72 --> 1448.32]  Next game
[1448.32 --> 1449.30]  They just like
[1449.30 --> 1451.22]  Overlay that person's
[1451.22 --> 1452.00]  Real avatar
[1452.00 --> 1453.18]  And real onscreen
[1453.18 --> 1453.66]  Name with like
[1453.66 --> 1454.04]  This guy
[1454.04 --> 1454.50]  And you like
[1454.50 --> 1455.10]  Destroy him
[1455.10 --> 1455.42]  Now that you
[1455.42 --> 1456.08]  Bought your new gun
[1456.08 --> 1458.04]  Do you think
[1458.04 --> 1458.68]  They could get
[1458.68 --> 1459.20]  That evil
[1459.20 --> 1460.40]  Why not
[1460.40 --> 1462.28]  I mean
[1462.28 --> 1463.08]  It's just an
[1463.08 --> 1464.16]  It's just a digital
[1464.16 --> 1464.80]  Identity
[1464.80 --> 1465.86]  That is actually
[1465.86 --> 1466.72]  Ultimately
[1466.72 --> 1468.04]  Pretty meaningless
[1468.04 --> 1468.94]  As far as it goes
[1468.94 --> 1469.60]  If they take two
[1469.60 --> 1470.36]  Randoms who don't
[1470.36 --> 1470.94]  Know each other
[1470.94 --> 1471.54]  They just sprinkle
[1471.54 --> 1472.08]  Bots in
[1472.08 --> 1473.68]  Just sprinkle
[1473.68 --> 1474.36]  Super advanced
[1474.36 --> 1474.88]  Bots in
[1474.88 --> 1475.28]  That just are
[1475.28 --> 1476.02]  Just pimped out
[1476.02 --> 1476.72]  Swagged out
[1476.72 --> 1477.54]  They got
[1477.54 --> 1478.34]  The guns are
[1478.34 --> 1479.20]  Shooting hot pink
[1479.20 --> 1479.60]  Bullets
[1479.60 --> 1480.28]  So you know
[1480.28 --> 1480.90]  Is this where
[1480.90 --> 1481.40]  We're going
[1481.40 --> 1483.96]  Holy crap
[1483.96 --> 1484.20]  Right
[1484.20 --> 1484.36]  Actually
[1484.36 --> 1485.28]  This leads us
[1485.28 --> 1486.46]  Pretty squarely
[1486.46 --> 1487.28]  Into another topic
[1487.28 --> 1487.70]  We have
[1487.70 --> 1488.26]  Does it
[1488.26 --> 1488.58]  Alright
[1488.58 --> 1489.16]  Yes it does
[1489.16 --> 1489.50]  Why don't we do that
[1489.50 --> 1490.56]  Yes it does
[1490.56 --> 1491.88]  Speaking of
[1491.88 --> 1492.86]  AI that's just
[1492.86 --> 1493.44]  So killer
[1493.44 --> 1494.50]  It can wreck you
[1494.50 --> 1495.04]  Every time
[1495.04 --> 1498.12]  Remember AlphaGo
[1498.12 --> 1500.74]  The deep neural net
[1500.74 --> 1502.50]  That managed to
[1502.50 --> 1503.44]  Swamp all the
[1503.44 --> 1504.20]  World's top Alpha
[1504.20 --> 1505.68]  Or top Go players
[1505.68 --> 1506.38]  In the last year
[1506.38 --> 1507.60]  So this is
[1507.60 --> 1509.00]  From Gizmodo here
[1509.00 --> 1509.64]  There you go
[1509.64 --> 1512.58]  Alright
[1512.58 --> 1514.20]  Tell me about it
[1514.20 --> 1515.68]  Okay so AlphaGo
[1515.68 --> 1516.38]  The first artificial
[1516.38 --> 1517.02]  Intelligence to
[1517.02 --> 1518.12]  Defeat a grandmaster
[1518.12 --> 1518.78]  At the game Go
[1518.78 --> 1520.40]  Just got a major
[1520.40 --> 1520.90]  Upgrade
[1520.90 --> 1521.76]  In a tournament
[1521.76 --> 1522.72]  That pitted AI
[1522.72 --> 1523.42]  Versus AI
[1523.42 --> 1525.66]  The regular AlphaGo
[1525.66 --> 1526.62]  Got completely
[1526.62 --> 1528.30]  Completely wrecked
[1528.30 --> 1529.72]  100 games to zero
[1529.72 --> 1530.96]  By the new version
[1530.96 --> 1531.50]  Of AlphaGo
[1531.50 --> 1532.90]  Called AlphaGo Zero
[1532.90 --> 1534.48]  Why did they call it
[1534.48 --> 1535.12]  AlphaGo Zero
[1535.12 --> 1535.96]  If it gets 100
[1535.96 --> 1536.60]  And not zero
[1536.60 --> 1537.64]  Because it's
[1537.64 --> 1538.50]  Singularity baby
[1538.50 --> 1540.76]  How is zero
[1540.76 --> 1541.32]  Singular
[1541.32 --> 1542.18]  What
[1542.18 --> 1542.64]  Do you know
[1542.64 --> 1543.40]  What singularity is
[1543.40 --> 1543.88]  Yeah yeah
[1543.88 --> 1545.42]  It's like
[1545.42 --> 1546.82]  Converging to zero
[1546.82 --> 1549.22]  I'm making this up
[1549.22 --> 1550.40]  What
[1550.40 --> 1550.94]  But I'm trying to
[1550.94 --> 1552.14]  Justify the name here
[1552.14 --> 1552.88]  What are you talking about
[1552.88 --> 1555.02]  Okay the thing
[1555.02 --> 1555.76]  That's cool about this
[1555.76 --> 1557.02]  Is the original AlphaGo
[1557.02 --> 1558.80]  Had a training data set
[1558.80 --> 1559.60]  Of thousands of
[1559.60 --> 1560.68]  Previously played
[1560.68 --> 1561.22]  Go games
[1561.22 --> 1562.54]  Played by humans
[1562.54 --> 1563.20]  That were amateurs
[1563.20 --> 1563.80]  Or professionals
[1563.80 --> 1564.16]  Like Go
[1564.16 --> 1565.14]  This
[1565.14 --> 1566.18]  Is a completely
[1566.18 --> 1567.18]  Unsupervised
[1567.18 --> 1568.30]  Like reinforcement
[1568.30 --> 1569.30]  Learning algorithm
[1569.30 --> 1570.74]  That had no
[1570.74 --> 1571.56]  Training data set
[1571.56 --> 1572.76]  No training data set
[1572.76 --> 1573.78]  It started only
[1573.78 --> 1574.44]  With the rules
[1574.44 --> 1575.14]  Of the game Go
[1575.14 --> 1576.32]  And in three days
[1576.32 --> 1577.56]  Could beat the original Go
[1577.56 --> 1580.70]  Isn't that insane
[1580.70 --> 1582.20]  So it played
[1582.20 --> 1584.14]  4.9 million games
[1584.14 --> 1585.10]  Against itself
[1585.10 --> 1587.10]  To acquire
[1587.10 --> 1587.86]  The expertise
[1587.86 --> 1588.52]  Needed
[1588.52 --> 1589.20]  To beat
[1589.20 --> 1590.84]  The original AlphaGo
[1590.84 --> 1592.44]  For comparison
[1592.44 --> 1593.90]  The original AlphaGo
[1593.90 --> 1595.64]  Had 30 million games
[1595.64 --> 1596.84]  For inspiration
[1596.84 --> 1599.60]  Wow
[1599.60 --> 1600.96]  After 40 days
[1600.96 --> 1601.52]  It defeated
[1601.52 --> 1602.38]  A more sophisticated
[1602.38 --> 1603.42]  Version of AlphaGo
[1603.42 --> 1604.24]  Called AlphaGo
[1604.24 --> 1604.76]  Master
[1604.76 --> 1605.88]  And that was the version
[1605.88 --> 1606.38]  That defeated
[1606.38 --> 1607.12]  The world's best
[1607.12 --> 1607.58]  Go players
[1607.58 --> 1608.22]  Last year
[1608.22 --> 1609.86]  It gets even crazier
[1609.86 --> 1610.86]  It did this
[1610.86 --> 1611.78]  Not only is it better
[1611.78 --> 1612.76]  It's not even that
[1612.76 --> 1613.24]  They just like
[1613.24 --> 1614.10]  Threw more computing
[1614.10 --> 1614.74]  Power at it
[1614.74 --> 1616.28]  It's way more efficient
[1616.28 --> 1617.08]  The original
[1617.08 --> 1617.96]  AlphaGo
[1617.96 --> 1618.40]  Master
[1618.40 --> 1619.30]  Had
[1619.30 --> 1621.80]  48 TPUs
[1621.80 --> 1622.08]  Or
[1622.08 --> 1624.00]  Tensor processing units
[1624.00 --> 1624.64]  This one
[1624.64 --> 1626.46]  Four
[1626.46 --> 1628.24]  Four TPUs
[1628.24 --> 1629.16]  Wow
[1629.16 --> 1629.32]  That's an
[1629.32 --> 1630.62]  Order of magnitude
[1630.62 --> 1631.42]  More efficient
[1631.42 --> 1634.58]  Now this is like
[1634.58 --> 1635.76]  Not general AI
[1635.76 --> 1636.14]  At all
[1636.14 --> 1637.14]  Yeah
[1637.14 --> 1637.60]  This is
[1637.60 --> 1638.52]  Playing a game
[1638.52 --> 1639.20]  But
[1639.20 --> 1639.64]  It's like
[1639.64 --> 1640.12]  Myth
[1640.12 --> 1640.50]  It's
[1640.50 --> 1640.80]  It's
[1640.80 --> 1643.56]  Okay
[1643.56 --> 1645.16]  Hmm
[1645.16 --> 1646.22]  Alright
[1646.22 --> 1646.52]  But this thing
[1646.52 --> 1647.06]  Could wreck you
[1647.06 --> 1647.72]  At Halo 2
[1647.72 --> 1648.94]  I don't
[1648.94 --> 1649.34]  Well
[1649.34 --> 1650.22]  Okay
[1650.22 --> 1650.62]  So that
[1650.62 --> 1651.26]  Okay
[1651.26 --> 1652.16]  It'll smash you
[1652.16 --> 1652.64]  With banshees
[1652.64 --> 1653.10]  Every time
[1653.10 --> 1653.88]  You're getting stuck
[1653.88 --> 1654.78]  From across the map
[1654.78 --> 1656.22]  No scope headshots
[1656.22 --> 1659.26]  There's pistol headshots
[1659.26 --> 1659.98]  Yeah
[1659.98 --> 1660.40]  Yeah
[1660.40 --> 1662.56]  Alright
[1662.56 --> 1663.60]  One more topic
[1663.60 --> 1664.76]  Before we go into ads
[1664.76 --> 1665.92]  This was originally posted
[1665.92 --> 1666.22]  By
[1666.22 --> 1667.30]  Jammie Scone
[1667.30 --> 1668.42]  Jammie
[1668.42 --> 1669.28]  Jammie Scone
[1669.28 --> 1669.70]  Whatever
[1669.70 --> 1670.52]  On the forum
[1670.52 --> 1671.50]  And the original
[1671.50 --> 1672.58]  Oh
[1672.58 --> 1673.70]  Jamie is gone
[1673.70 --> 1675.34]  The original article
[1675.34 --> 1676.22]  Is from
[1676.22 --> 1677.68]  KitGuru.net
[1677.68 --> 1678.96]  No I don't want
[1678.96 --> 1679.66]  Your notifications
[1679.66 --> 1680.70]  Apple
[1680.70 --> 1681.60]  Reportedly
[1681.60 --> 1682.30]  Cut
[1682.30 --> 1683.16]  Down
[1683.16 --> 1684.36]  iPhone 8
[1684.36 --> 1684.90]  Production
[1684.90 --> 1686.08]  Already
[1686.08 --> 1687.96]  I mean if it
[1687.96 --> 1690.54]  If it wasn't a strong enough indication
[1690.54 --> 1692.68]  That iPhone 8 isn't doing particularly well
[1692.68 --> 1694.80]  That there were literally no lineups
[1694.80 --> 1696.00]  Like that was a big thing
[1696.00 --> 1697.14]  With the iPhone 8 launch
[1697.14 --> 1698.44]  This
[1698.44 --> 1699.78]  Seems to be
[1699.78 --> 1702.68]  This seems to pretty much
[1702.68 --> 1703.72]  Drive the point home
[1703.72 --> 1704.46]  Apparently
[1704.46 --> 1706.94]  iPhone 8 and 8 Plus production
[1706.94 --> 1708.34]  Has been reduced by about
[1708.34 --> 1709.48]  50%
[1709.48 --> 1711.22]  For November and December
[1711.22 --> 1712.22]  Which are typically
[1712.22 --> 1713.48]  Pretty
[1713.48 --> 1715.32]  Strong
[1715.32 --> 1716.18]  Sales months
[1716.18 --> 1717.14]  For mobile devices
[1717.14 --> 1718.14]  And this is
[1718.14 --> 1719.72]  Apparently the first time
[1719.72 --> 1720.52]  Apple has reduced
[1720.52 --> 1721.36]  iPhone production
[1721.36 --> 1723.04]  So early in the cycle
[1723.04 --> 1724.70]  This is really worrying
[1724.70 --> 1725.26]  Considering
[1725.26 --> 1726.96]  Like the bright side of this
[1726.96 --> 1727.94]  Would be to assume
[1727.94 --> 1728.66]  That all these people
[1728.66 --> 1729.32]  Who aren't
[1729.32 --> 1730.28]  Buying the 8
[1730.28 --> 1731.38]  Are just waiting
[1731.38 --> 1732.20]  To buy the 10
[1732.20 --> 1732.88]  But
[1732.88 --> 1734.06]  But
[1734.06 --> 1734.96]  They probably won't even
[1734.96 --> 1735.94]  Be able to buy the 10
[1735.94 --> 1736.88]  And
[1736.88 --> 1737.72]  The other issue
[1737.72 --> 1738.48]  Is that apparently
[1738.48 --> 1739.84]  A lot of people
[1739.84 --> 1741.42]  Are opting for the iPhone 7
[1741.42 --> 1742.14]  Instead of the 8
[1742.14 --> 1742.52]  Which is
[1742.52 --> 1743.36]  Frankly
[1743.36 --> 1744.56]  A decision that
[1744.56 --> 1745.00]  Okay
[1745.00 --> 1745.54]  A
[1745.54 --> 1747.00]  Makes a lot of sense
[1747.00 --> 1747.38]  To me
[1747.38 --> 1748.36]  In the first place
[1748.36 --> 1749.02]  Because
[1749.02 --> 1750.24]  The iPhone 7 and 8
[1750.24 --> 1750.78]  Are really
[1750.78 --> 1752.38]  Really not very different
[1752.38 --> 1753.18]  You're getting way more
[1753.18 --> 1753.86]  Eyes per dollar
[1753.86 --> 1757.06]  And number two
[1757.06 --> 1758.70]  The more people
[1758.70 --> 1759.82]  Go out there
[1759.82 --> 1762.00]  And buy the iPhone 7
[1762.00 --> 1763.36]  The longer
[1763.36 --> 1764.40]  The support cycle
[1764.40 --> 1765.36]  We are likely to see
[1765.36 --> 1765.96]  On that product
[1765.96 --> 1766.32]  Because
[1766.32 --> 1767.60]  And this is
[1767.60 --> 1768.20]  This is something
[1768.20 --> 1768.54]  That's
[1768.54 --> 1768.82]  I
[1768.82 --> 1770.14]  That actually comes up
[1770.14 --> 1771.26]  Fairly often
[1771.26 --> 1772.22]  When I'm talking about
[1772.22 --> 1772.62]  You know
[1772.62 --> 1773.38]  What tech product
[1773.38 --> 1774.00]  You should buy
[1774.00 --> 1775.34]  A lot of the time
[1775.34 --> 1776.50]  It doesn't work out
[1776.50 --> 1777.74]  To be in your best interest
[1777.74 --> 1778.58]  To go and buy
[1778.58 --> 1778.92]  Say
[1778.92 --> 1780.52]  The most expensive motherboard
[1780.52 --> 1782.16]  Because a lot of the time
[1782.16 --> 1783.16]  What can end up happening
[1783.16 --> 1784.54]  Is because they sell
[1784.54 --> 1785.60]  So few units
[1785.60 --> 1786.34]  Of that model
[1786.34 --> 1787.86]  It might end up
[1787.86 --> 1789.64]  With a very short support cycle
[1789.64 --> 1792.24]  And a much smaller install base
[1792.24 --> 1794.12]  Of people to call into tech support
[1794.12 --> 1794.78]  And complain
[1794.78 --> 1796.28]  If something goes wrong
[1796.28 --> 1797.58]  They might end up with
[1797.58 --> 1799.08]  More compatibility issues
[1799.08 --> 1799.62]  Down the line
[1799.62 --> 1801.40]  Because of that smaller install base
[1801.40 --> 1802.60]  Installing a wide variety
[1802.60 --> 1803.08]  Of hardware
[1803.08 --> 1803.36]  To
[1803.36 --> 1804.50]  You know
[1804.50 --> 1806.52]  Find out if there's any issues
[1806.52 --> 1807.96]  And report them to the manufacturer
[1807.96 --> 1808.78]  So
[1808.78 --> 1809.34]  Owning
[1809.34 --> 1809.90]  The like
[1809.90 --> 1811.12]  The popular one
[1811.12 --> 1812.92]  Can actually be
[1812.92 --> 1813.82]  Really good
[1813.82 --> 1815.30]  Because the iPhone 7
[1815.30 --> 1816.06]  Here's another thing
[1816.06 --> 1817.34]  If there's a huge install base
[1817.34 --> 1819.10]  Even not directly from Apple
[1819.10 --> 1819.94]  Even if we're talking
[1819.94 --> 1820.88]  From app developers
[1820.88 --> 1822.90]  If there's a huge install base
[1822.90 --> 1823.92]  Of these iPhone 7s
[1823.92 --> 1824.98]  Because Apple was effectively
[1824.98 --> 1826.20]  Selling them for two years
[1826.20 --> 1826.92]  At full pop
[1826.92 --> 1828.14]  Or at full speed
[1828.14 --> 1829.02]  Then
[1829.02 --> 1830.12]  You're going to see
[1830.12 --> 1830.76]  App developers
[1830.76 --> 1831.68]  Really focus on
[1831.68 --> 1833.04]  Optimizing for that phone
[1833.04 --> 1834.10]  For a longer time
[1834.10 --> 1834.80]  Into the future
[1834.80 --> 1836.84]  As those iPhones
[1836.84 --> 1837.96]  Start to have their screens
[1837.96 --> 1838.36]  Broken
[1838.36 --> 1839.48]  Or start to be replaced
[1839.48 --> 1841.16]  It's just going to take longer
[1841.16 --> 1842.14]  Before you aren't
[1842.14 --> 1843.56]  Worth investing in anymore
[1843.56 --> 1844.58]  So
[1844.58 --> 1845.92]  The fact that
[1845.92 --> 1847.06]  There's this momentum
[1847.06 --> 1848.06]  On the iPhone 7
[1848.06 --> 1849.00]  Become sort of a
[1849.00 --> 1849.40]  Self
[1849.40 --> 1851.54]  Self reinforcing
[1851.54 --> 1853.08]  Positivity snowball
[1853.08 --> 1854.66]  And the more people
[1854.66 --> 1856.64]  Realize that the iPhone 7
[1856.64 --> 1857.26]  Is a great choice
[1857.26 --> 1857.98]  Compared to the 8
[1857.98 --> 1859.48]  The more it will be
[1859.48 --> 1860.36]  A great choice
[1860.36 --> 1861.72]  Compared to the 8
[1861.72 --> 1862.66]  That's where I was
[1862.66 --> 1863.70]  Coming to
[1863.70 --> 1864.82]  That's your positivity snowball
[1864.82 --> 1866.24]  That's my positivity snowball
[1866.24 --> 1868.94]  So I mean
[1868.94 --> 1869.64]  I ended up
[1869.64 --> 1870.90]  Just by chance
[1870.90 --> 1871.86]  With a couple of
[1871.86 --> 1872.94]  Those types of devices
[1872.94 --> 1873.94]  So the iPad 1
[1873.94 --> 1875.18]  Was a big steaming pile
[1875.18 --> 1875.70]  Of beta
[1875.70 --> 1878.20]  It didn't end up
[1878.20 --> 1878.72]  Being supported
[1878.72 --> 1879.38]  For very long
[1879.38 --> 1879.92]  It was thick
[1879.92 --> 1880.76]  The battery life sucked
[1880.76 --> 1881.98]  It was super slow
[1881.98 --> 1883.24]  iPhone 2
[1883.24 --> 1884.34]  Did I say iPhone?
[1884.78 --> 1885.28]  You said iPad
[1885.28 --> 1885.88]  Okay good
[1885.88 --> 1886.90]  iPad 2
[1886.90 --> 1888.70]  Way better in every way
[1888.70 --> 1889.86]  Like fantastic
[1889.86 --> 1890.52]  And
[1890.52 --> 1891.98]  Made a ton of sense
[1891.98 --> 1892.50]  As a product
[1892.50 --> 1893.46]  For quite some time
[1893.46 --> 1894.18]  Because even the ones
[1894.18 --> 1895.16]  That came after it
[1895.16 --> 1896.76]  Were adding things like
[1896.76 --> 1898.12]  High resolution displays
[1898.12 --> 1899.38]  That actually
[1899.38 --> 1900.98]  Ended up
[1900.98 --> 1902.12]  Hurting battery life
[1902.12 --> 1902.78]  As much as they
[1902.78 --> 1903.78]  Increased the resolution
[1903.78 --> 1904.20]  Of the display
[1904.20 --> 1905.06]  They ran hotter
[1905.06 --> 1906.70]  Like the iPad 2
[1906.70 --> 1908.02]  Had stuff going for it
[1908.02 --> 1909.50]  For like 3 or 4 generations
[1909.50 --> 1910.14]  Afterward
[1910.14 --> 1911.14]  It wasn't until the air
[1911.14 --> 1911.56]  I think
[1911.56 --> 1912.60]  That we got one
[1912.60 --> 1914.10]  That was higher resolution
[1914.10 --> 1915.14]  And better battery
[1915.14 --> 1916.04]  And ran cooler
[1916.04 --> 1916.76]  Was like better
[1916.76 --> 1917.72]  In every possible way
[1917.72 --> 1919.72]  So my iPad 2
[1919.72 --> 1920.46]  Ended up getting supported
[1920.46 --> 1921.22]  Almost forever
[1921.22 --> 1922.64]  And the same with the iPad
[1922.64 --> 1923.92]  Or with the iPhone 4
[1923.92 --> 1924.78]  And I ended up with like
[1924.78 --> 1925.56]  Both of them at the same time
[1925.56 --> 1926.30]  I was like this is great
[1926.30 --> 1926.84]  Apple supports
[1926.84 --> 1927.64]  Super devices for like
[1927.64 --> 1928.62]  4 or 5 years
[1928.62 --> 1929.14]  This is awesome
[1929.14 --> 1932.52]  But it doesn't always
[1932.52 --> 1933.24]  Work out like that
[1933.24 --> 1934.10]  So it's really nice
[1934.10 --> 1934.62]  When you end up
[1934.62 --> 1935.34]  With something like that
[1935.34 --> 1935.84]  And it looks like
[1935.84 --> 1936.68]  The iPhone 7
[1936.68 --> 1937.76]  Could be another one
[1937.76 --> 1939.08]  I personally wish
[1939.08 --> 1940.08]  It had been the 6S
[1940.08 --> 1941.44]  Because it has a headphone jack
[1941.44 --> 1942.16]  But
[1942.16 --> 1943.64]  Sorry
[1943.64 --> 1946.52]  Oh yeah
[1946.52 --> 1947.30]  The Apple Watch
[1947.30 --> 1948.04]  What about it
[1948.04 --> 1950.18]  Oh you're just upset
[1950.18 --> 1950.86]  Because you lost
[1950.86 --> 1951.90]  That playlist feature
[1951.90 --> 1952.48]  Yeah
[1952.48 --> 1953.06]  So Apple
[1953.06 --> 1953.38]  Right
[1953.38 --> 1954.24]  Does not behave
[1954.24 --> 1954.82]  In this way
[1954.82 --> 1955.58]  Every time
[1955.58 --> 1956.90]  You have a second gen
[1956.90 --> 1958.28]  Yeah
[1958.28 --> 1959.22]  Second gen
[1959.22 --> 1959.44]  Yeah
[1959.44 --> 1961.04]  Ed just lost a feature
[1961.04 --> 1962.78]  That was deprecated
[1962.78 --> 1963.72]  Seemingly
[1963.72 --> 1964.50]  And we have no
[1964.50 --> 1965.56]  Insider knowledge
[1965.56 --> 1966.30]  At Apple or anything
[1966.30 --> 1967.34]  But seemingly
[1967.34 --> 1968.30]  To make room
[1968.30 --> 1969.54]  For a new version
[1969.54 --> 1970.26]  Of the feature
[1970.26 --> 1971.88]  That is only available
[1971.88 --> 1973.20]  On the new one
[1973.20 --> 1975.56]  That has LTE connectivity
[1975.56 --> 1978.88]  So you're just going to
[1978.88 --> 1979.46]  Buy the new one
[1979.46 --> 1980.24]  Aren't you
[1980.24 --> 1980.62]  What
[1980.62 --> 1982.02]  You are aren't you
[1982.02 --> 1982.28]  What
[1982.28 --> 1982.94]  You're crazy
[1982.94 --> 1983.82]  Are you already
[1983.82 --> 1984.34]  Wearing it
[1984.34 --> 1984.88]  No
[1984.88 --> 1986.32]  Did you already
[1986.32 --> 1986.96]  Buy the new one
[1986.96 --> 1987.36]  Did you already
[1987.36 --> 1987.84]  Order it
[1987.84 --> 1988.74]  That's crazy
[1988.74 --> 1989.52]  Are you going to
[1989.52 --> 1990.10]  The Apple store
[1990.10 --> 1990.98]  This weekend
[1990.98 --> 1993.36]  He's already
[1993.36 --> 1993.96]  On the Apple store
[1993.96 --> 1994.48]  Right now
[1994.48 --> 1995.68]  I have to get
[1995.68 --> 1996.34]  This replaced
[1996.34 --> 1997.00]  Because I have
[1997.00 --> 1997.82]  A chip on there
[1997.82 --> 1998.86]  And I'll sell
[1998.86 --> 1999.36]  This one
[1999.36 --> 1999.98]  Then you'll sell
[1999.98 --> 2000.40]  That one
[2000.40 --> 2000.84]  And get the new
[2000.84 --> 2001.30]  Are you really
[2001.30 --> 2002.00]  Going to get the new one
[2002.00 --> 2005.56]  See you are
[2005.56 --> 2006.62]  Everything that's wrong
[2006.62 --> 2006.96]  With
[2006.96 --> 2007.86]  Man
[2007.86 --> 2008.56]  You're killing me
[2008.56 --> 2009.04]  He's one of those
[2009.04 --> 2009.52]  Apple people
[2009.52 --> 2009.94]  Do you actually
[2009.94 --> 2010.44]  Need something
[2010.44 --> 2011.54]  What can I do
[2011.54 --> 2011.74]  For you
[2011.74 --> 2013.50]  To where
[2013.50 --> 2014.36]  L.A.
[2015.76 --> 2017.00]  When do I have to decide
[2017.00 --> 2019.36]  Singers matter
[2019.36 --> 2020.54]  Wait today
[2020.54 --> 2022.24]  Are we making
[2022.24 --> 2023.34]  A thing for us
[2023.34 --> 2023.58]  There
[2023.58 --> 2024.56]  I don't know
[2024.56 --> 2025.48]  Probably not
[2025.48 --> 2026.22]  No
[2026.22 --> 2027.12]  Let's go with no
[2027.12 --> 2028.00]  I don't know
[2028.00 --> 2028.86]  We'll talk about it later
[2028.86 --> 2029.46]  We'll talk about it later
[2029.46 --> 2030.20]  Okay
[2030.20 --> 2031.16]  Right
[2031.16 --> 2031.52]  Right
[2031.52 --> 2032.16]  We've got to do
[2032.16 --> 2032.48]  Our
[2032.48 --> 2033.10]  We've got to do
[2033.10 --> 2033.62]  Our sponsors
[2033.62 --> 2038.26]  Sponsor number one
[2038.26 --> 2039.66]  Is iFixit
[2039.66 --> 2041.16]  Please put those
[2041.16 --> 2041.90]  Glasses on
[2041.90 --> 2042.96]  What
[2042.96 --> 2044.20]  Alright
[2044.20 --> 2044.62]  Try it
[2044.62 --> 2045.20]  You'll like it
[2045.20 --> 2046.00]  I will wear
[2046.00 --> 2047.06]  Oh they're not even here
[2047.06 --> 2048.08]  Nope
[2048.08 --> 2048.82]  They were stolen
[2048.82 --> 2051.10]  I'm serious
[2051.10 --> 2051.58]  They're not there
[2051.58 --> 2052.92]  Oh man
[2052.92 --> 2053.52]  No

[2063.82 --> 2064.68]  Stuff
[2064.68 --> 2066.02]  Because why
[2066.02 --> 2066.88]  Should you
[2066.88 --> 2067.98]  Pay a manufacturer
[2067.98 --> 2069.04]  A bunch of money
[2069.04 --> 2070.86]  Or throw something out
[2070.86 --> 2071.66]  Contributing to
[2071.66 --> 2073.12]  Waste in our world
[2073.12 --> 2074.44]  When you can repair
[2074.44 --> 2075.42]  Something yourself
[2075.42 --> 2076.22]  For often
[2076.22 --> 2077.74]  A fraction of the cost
[2077.74 --> 2080.78]  So iFixit has tons of great guides
[2080.78 --> 2082.50]  For taking apart
[2082.50 --> 2084.56]  Repairing and putting back together

[2099.12 --> 2100.60]  A wide variety of plastic

[2102.10 --> 2102.88]  They're so dope
[2102.88 --> 2103.78]  You look like a superhero
[2103.78 --> 2106.18]  The full coverage up here
[2106.18 --> 2108.40]  They've got ESD safe tweezers
[2108.40 --> 2109.44]  They've got prying tools

[2124.40 --> 2126.38]  Bringing us to
[2126.38 --> 2128.30]  Savage Jerky
[2128.30 --> 2130.52]  You know what
[2130.52 --> 2132.20]  Luke isn't here
[2132.20 --> 2133.88]  To make me suffer this week
[2133.88 --> 2134.60]  We know
[2134.60 --> 2135.90]  We get it
[2135.90 --> 2137.18]  So I'm actually
[2137.18 --> 2139.08]  Just going to mal
[2139.08 --> 2141.02]  On my favorite
[2141.02 --> 2142.20]  Savage Jerky
[2142.20 --> 2144.16]  The maple buffalo bacon
[2144.16 --> 2145.12]  Yes
[2145.12 --> 2145.96]  Stereotypical
[2145.96 --> 2146.44]  Yes
[2146.44 --> 2147.28]  It's only a
[2147.28 --> 2148.72]  It's only a two star
[2148.72 --> 2150.18]  Two star
[2150.18 --> 2151.50]  Hotness level
[2151.50 --> 2153.24]  But quite frankly
[2153.24 --> 2154.02]  You know
[2154.02 --> 2155.54]  What was my drawing power anyway
[2155.54 --> 2156.64]  Do you really think
[2156.64 --> 2157.48]  I'm more than a two
[2157.48 --> 2160.36]  Out of what
[2160.36 --> 2161.80]  Wait a minute
[2161.80 --> 2162.68]  Is this the maple
[2162.68 --> 2163.86]  Yeah I think this is the one I like
[2163.86 --> 2165.88]  Do they have more than one maple bacon
[2165.88 --> 2172.12]  It doesn't even offer me anything
[2172.12 --> 2172.50]  They might
[2172.50 --> 2175.00]  Wow
[2175.00 --> 2176.12]  This is really nice too
[2176.12 --> 2176.92]  No
[2176.92 --> 2177.80]  Never mind
[2177.80 --> 2179.48]  Well you're a vegetarian
[2179.48 --> 2181.12]  I still want to smell the bag
[2181.12 --> 2182.82]  Here you can have some if you want
[2182.82 --> 2184.36]  Unbelievable
[2184.36 --> 2185.46]  There you go
[2185.46 --> 2186.58]  Mmm
[2186.58 --> 2188.96]  Oh yeah this is a new flavor
[2188.96 --> 2189.48]  This is nice
[2189.48 --> 2190.08]  So it's like
[2190.08 --> 2191.60]  Can I at least waft
[2191.60 --> 2192.70]  Yeah you can waft it
[2192.70 --> 2193.56]  It's really good
[2193.56 --> 2194.52]  You can't
[2194.52 --> 2195.98]  You probably won't be able to smell the maple
[2195.98 --> 2197.22]  God damn that smells good
[2197.22 --> 2199.36]  You can't swear on the show
[2199.36 --> 2200.20]  We've been through this
[2200.20 --> 2201.50]  What are you counting
[2201.50 --> 2203.32]  As swear words now
[2203.32 --> 2206.58]  Heavens to Betsy
[2206.58 --> 2208.28]  You can say heavens to Betsy
[2208.28 --> 2209.08]  Are you sure
[2209.08 --> 2210.94]  So savage jerky is made with the best ingredients
[2210.94 --> 2212.44]  Without nitrates or preservatives
[2212.44 --> 2214.54]  The goal was to create a snack
[2214.54 --> 2215.82]  That's full of flavor and spice
[2215.82 --> 2216.92]  But that isn't bad for you
[2216.92 --> 2218.38]  And they've got 13 different flavors
[2218.38 --> 2221.12]  I'm a huge fan of the mojo
[2221.12 --> 2223.96]  Maple
[2223.96 --> 2224.82]  Maple bacon
[2224.82 --> 2225.88]  That's freaking awesome
[2225.88 --> 2228.50]  Is it original is what they call it
[2228.50 --> 2229.10]  Yeah original
[2229.10 --> 2230.34]  That one's really good
[2230.34 --> 2231.40]  The salt and peppers
[2231.40 --> 2232.20]  You know what
[2232.20 --> 2232.94]  They're all really good
[2232.94 --> 2234.86]  And if you're not into just tasty
[2234.86 --> 2236.42]  And you want stuff that will like
[2236.42 --> 2237.54]  Melt your mouth off
[2237.54 --> 2238.86]  Man
[2238.86 --> 2239.46]  They've got
[2239.46 --> 2240.70]  They've got jerkies
[2240.70 --> 2242.38]  They've also got hot sauces
[2242.38 --> 2244.12]  Made with like Carolina reapers
[2244.12 --> 2244.60]  These are
[2244.60 --> 2245.60]  Like some of the
[2245.60 --> 2247.02]  These are some of the hottest
[2247.02 --> 2248.44]  Hottest peppers in the world
[2248.44 --> 2248.86]  Trust me
[2248.86 --> 2249.30]  They will
[2249.30 --> 2250.92]  They will light your mouth on fire
[2250.92 --> 2252.24]  They will light your butt on fire
[2252.24 --> 2253.26]  I can attest
[2253.26 --> 2254.04]  I can attest
[2254.04 --> 2254.26]  Yep
[2254.26 --> 2255.56]  You can use offer code LTT
[2255.56 --> 2257.70]  To save 10% on your butt fire
[2257.70 --> 2260.58]  Over at savagejerky.com

[2262.46 --> 2263.64]  Save 10%

[2268.40 --> 2269.94]  Leading us
[2269.94 --> 2271.18]  You're one of those koozie people
[2271.18 --> 2272.90]  A koozie person
[2272.90 --> 2273.92]  You don't say cozy
[2273.92 --> 2275.00]  You say koozie
[2275.00 --> 2276.32]  Oh
[2276.32 --> 2278.58]  I had never heard it said aloud
[2278.58 --> 2279.76]  Oh
[2279.76 --> 2280.50]  Yeah
[2280.50 --> 2281.64]  Never been to a barbecue
[2281.64 --> 2283.00]  But
[2283.00 --> 2284.84]  No one ever invites me to things
[2284.84 --> 2286.02]  Yeah
[2286.02 --> 2287.68]  I'm going to one this weekend
[2287.68 --> 2288.30]  You should
[2288.30 --> 2289.52]  Hear about it on Monday
[2289.52 --> 2289.98]  When I come back
[2289.98 --> 2291.72]  Wow
[2291.72 --> 2292.68]  Speaking of
[2292.68 --> 2293.30]  You know what
[2293.30 --> 2293.84]  Hold on a second
[2293.84 --> 2295.52]  We're going to do our next sponsor spot
[2295.52 --> 2296.80]  In a little bit
[2296.80 --> 2298.44]  We'll move on
[2298.44 --> 2298.92]  Hold on
[2298.92 --> 2300.62]  Because I got to side rail us
[2300.62 --> 2301.40]  For a little bit here
[2301.40 --> 2304.52]  You went to WWE this week
[2304.52 --> 2304.90]  Yeah
[2304.90 --> 2306.44]  Nobody asked me about that
[2306.44 --> 2308.68]  I went to Smackdown Live
[2308.68 --> 2310.28]  I actually have
[2310.28 --> 2310.84]  Check this out
[2310.84 --> 2311.58]  Check this out
[2311.58 --> 2314.04]  Here
[2314.04 --> 2316.32]  I sent an email to myself
[2316.32 --> 2316.84]  No
[2316.84 --> 2318.08]  To remind myself
[2318.08 --> 2318.40]  Really
[2318.40 --> 2319.84]  Ask James
[2319.84 --> 2321.52]  About WWE
[2321.52 --> 2322.20]  Because
[2322.20 --> 2323.48]  Here it is
[2323.48 --> 2323.86]  Here it is
[2323.86 --> 2325.02]  So I sent this to myself
[2325.02 --> 2326.96]  On October 17th
[2326.96 --> 2327.64]  Three days ago
[2327.64 --> 2328.40]  Because
[2328.40 --> 2330.06]  The day after
[2330.06 --> 2331.00]  Because I was like
[2331.00 --> 2331.82]  Super
[2331.82 --> 2333.28]  I was super curious
[2333.28 --> 2334.92]  What was
[2334.92 --> 2335.62]  I mean
[2335.62 --> 2337.50]  You're not like a WWE fan
[2337.50 --> 2337.76]  Right
[2337.76 --> 2338.28]  No
[2338.28 --> 2340.40]  So you think it's kind of ridiculous
[2340.40 --> 2343.06]  I watched it as a child
[2343.06 --> 2343.78]  And then
[2343.78 --> 2345.32]  Watched it for way longer
[2345.32 --> 2346.54]  Than I would have
[2346.54 --> 2347.44]  Because my friend
[2347.44 --> 2348.32]  Was super into it
[2348.32 --> 2349.28]  He didn't know
[2349.28 --> 2350.36]  It was fake
[2350.36 --> 2351.18]  Really
[2351.18 --> 2352.10]  No I'm just joking
[2352.10 --> 2352.88]  Of course you know it's fake
[2352.88 --> 2354.28]  It's kind of like
[2354.28 --> 2355.92]  It was kind of slapsticky
[2355.92 --> 2356.38]  Slapstick
[2356.38 --> 2357.20]  There was a couple
[2357.20 --> 2358.40]  LOL moments
[2358.40 --> 2359.60]  Watching it live actually
[2359.60 --> 2361.64]  None of the big superstars
[2361.64 --> 2362.66]  That I know of
[2362.66 --> 2363.40]  Were there of course
[2363.40 --> 2363.96]  Because they're all
[2363.96 --> 2364.66]  Retired now
[2364.66 --> 2365.28]  Like Stone Cold
[2365.28 --> 2366.06]  It's not going to show up
[2366.06 --> 2366.88]  So it was all
[2366.88 --> 2367.86]  Like no names to me
[2367.86 --> 2369.82]  So I felt more like
[2369.82 --> 2370.38]  I was at like
[2370.38 --> 2370.90]  One of those
[2370.90 --> 2371.84]  Mexican wrestling events
[2371.84 --> 2372.48]  Just because they're all
[2372.48 --> 2372.84]  No names
[2372.84 --> 2373.82]  And they're doing stupid stuff
[2373.82 --> 2374.70]  And one guy actually
[2374.70 --> 2375.22]  Had a Mexican
[2375.22 --> 2376.48]  Wrestling mask on
[2376.48 --> 2378.02]  So that contributed
[2378.02 --> 2378.46]  To the feel
[2378.46 --> 2379.96]  Family fun
[2379.96 --> 2382.12]  And pretty
[2382.12 --> 2382.94]  Pretty entertaining
[2382.94 --> 2384.62]  How much was it?
[2385.14 --> 2385.82]  20 bucks
[2385.82 --> 2386.56]  That's why I went
[2386.56 --> 2388.40]  It was sweet
[2388.40 --> 2388.90]  Alright
[2388.90 --> 2390.54]  It was sweet
[2390.54 --> 2391.46]  So tell me
[2391.46 --> 2392.38]  How sweet was it?
[2392.58 --> 2393.66]  Was it sweet in a
[2393.66 --> 2395.14]  This was a great way
[2395.14 --> 2395.94]  To turn my brain off
[2395.94 --> 2396.64]  For two hours
[2396.64 --> 2398.50]  On a Tuesday night way
[2398.50 --> 2399.66]  Or was it great
[2399.66 --> 2400.04]  In a like
[2400.04 --> 2400.64]  I'm going to start
[2400.64 --> 2401.84]  Finding out who these guys are
[2401.84 --> 2402.80]  And following the storylines
[2402.80 --> 2403.36]  Not a chance
[2403.36 --> 2403.96]  It was a great
[2403.96 --> 2404.64]  In the like
[2404.64 --> 2405.86]  I get to hang out
[2405.86 --> 2406.68]  And like have dinner
[2406.68 --> 2407.50]  And spend the evening
[2407.50 --> 2408.90]  With my childhood friend
[2408.90 --> 2409.64]  Who I only get to see
[2409.64 --> 2410.52]  Like every quarter
[2410.52 --> 2411.48]  Kind of way
[2411.48 --> 2412.92]  And it was only 20 bucks
[2412.92 --> 2413.68]  It was 50 bucks
[2413.68 --> 2414.30]  Wouldn't have done it
[2414.30 --> 2415.94]  Not a chance
[2415.94 --> 2417.46]  Sorry childhood friend
[2417.46 --> 2419.52]  You're worth 20 bucks
[2419.52 --> 2420.38]  I'd hang out with him
[2420.38 --> 2420.68]  Without
[2420.68 --> 2422.16]  But not 50 bucks
[2422.16 --> 2424.46]  I just wouldn't have
[2424.46 --> 2425.52]  Went to that with him
[2425.52 --> 2427.58]  But yeah
[2427.58 --> 2427.92]  It was sweet
[2427.92 --> 2429.06]  Best part was the
[2429.06 --> 2430.94]  The voice announcer guy
[2430.94 --> 2431.98]  Yeah
[2431.98 --> 2433.30]  I love that
[2433.30 --> 2434.38]  The ability to like
[2434.38 --> 2435.02]  Grab the microphone
[2435.02 --> 2436.94]  And you know
[2436.94 --> 2437.56]  Like the let's get
[2437.56 --> 2438.28]  Ready to rumble
[2438.28 --> 2438.76]  Kind of guy
[2438.76 --> 2439.88]  Are we even allowed
[2439.88 --> 2440.54]  To say that?
[2440.64 --> 2441.48]  I know we can't do it
[2441.48 --> 2442.30]  With the intonation
[2442.30 --> 2442.72]  He has that
[2442.72 --> 2443.52]  Trademark
[2443.52 --> 2443.80]  Yeah
[2443.80 --> 2444.64]  The intonation
[2444.64 --> 2445.52]  You have to say it
[2445.52 --> 2446.44]  Like Stephen Hawking style
[2446.44 --> 2447.96]  Ready to rumble
[2447.96 --> 2448.58]  I don't even know
[2448.58 --> 2449.44]  If you can say it at all
[2449.44 --> 2450.16]  Oh my goodness
[2450.16 --> 2450.82]  It's one of those things
[2450.82 --> 2451.52]  Like the whole
[2451.52 --> 2452.80]  The whole copyright
[2452.80 --> 2454.04]  On happy birthday
[2454.04 --> 2455.68]  That actually recently
[2455.68 --> 2456.02]  Was
[2456.02 --> 2457.16]  That one was overturned
[2457.16 --> 2457.32]  But
[2457.32 --> 2458.58]  Where like
[2458.58 --> 2459.70]  Nobody even realizes
[2459.70 --> 2460.52]  That you like
[2460.52 --> 2461.60]  Can't say this stuff
[2461.60 --> 2462.10]  Because they'll
[2462.10 --> 2463.36]  Actually go after you
[2463.36 --> 2463.80]  Do you know that
[2463.80 --> 2464.50]  Rudolph was invented
[2464.50 --> 2465.12]  By Coca-Cola?
[2466.18 --> 2466.58]  No
[2466.58 --> 2468.98]  Let that bake your noodle
[2468.98 --> 2469.46]  For a second
[2469.46 --> 2470.32]  Huh
[2470.32 --> 2470.94]  They also made
[2470.94 --> 2471.58]  Santa Claus red
[2471.58 --> 2473.58]  Enjoy Coke
[2473.58 --> 2475.64]  How about that?
[2476.30 --> 2476.78]  How about that?
[2476.78 --> 2478.06]  Alright
[2478.06 --> 2479.10]  Okay
[2479.10 --> 2479.82]  Let's do our last
[2479.82 --> 2480.62]  Sponsor spot now
[2480.62 --> 2481.26]  Sorry for that
[2481.26 --> 2482.78]  Totally unrelated aside
[2482.78 --> 2484.74]  Sewol Direct
[2484.74 --> 2486.08]  Check this out
[2486.08 --> 2487.58]  This is a new sponsor
[2487.58 --> 2487.82]  Right?
[2487.98 --> 2489.00]  Connect anything
[2489.00 --> 2490.44]  In a nutshell
[2490.44 --> 2492.28]  They sell all sorts
[2492.28 --> 2493.24]  Of audiovisual equipment
[2493.24 --> 2493.62]  Cables
[2493.62 --> 2494.16]  Extenders
[2494.16 --> 2494.70]  They specialize
[2494.70 --> 2495.66]  In HDMI cables
[2495.66 --> 2496.10]  Extenders
[2496.10 --> 2496.60]  Switches
[2496.60 --> 2497.70]  Splitters
[2497.70 --> 2498.40]  Speaker wire
[2498.40 --> 2499.20]  Banana plugs
[2499.20 --> 2500.50]  IR remote control
[2500.50 --> 2500.92]  Extenders
[2500.92 --> 2502.18]  And they cut out
[2502.18 --> 2502.54]  The middleman
[2502.54 --> 2503.16]  By designing and
[2503.16 --> 2503.64]  Manufacturing
[2503.64 --> 2504.36]  The products themselves
[2504.36 --> 2504.86]  Which they sell
[2504.86 --> 2505.56]  Directly to you
[2505.56 --> 2506.40]  So we've got
[2506.40 --> 2507.00]  A couple of their
[2507.00 --> 2508.14]  HDMI extenders
[2508.14 --> 2509.20]  So
[2509.20 --> 2509.68]  Oh these are
[2509.68 --> 2510.16]  Oh okay
[2510.16 --> 2510.58]  Yeah these are
[2510.58 --> 2510.72]  Cool
[2510.72 --> 2511.36]  I've seen these before
[2511.36 --> 2512.50]  These are
[2512.50 --> 2513.60]  HDMI over
[2513.60 --> 2514.64]  Cat5 adapters
[2514.64 --> 2515.94]  So basically
[2515.94 --> 2516.80]  Instead of trying to
[2516.80 --> 2517.52]  Run a super long
[2517.52 --> 2518.26]  HDMI cable
[2518.26 --> 2519.30]  Which either
[2519.30 --> 2519.90]  Doesn't work
[2519.90 --> 2520.32]  Or you have to
[2520.32 --> 2520.78]  Get a special
[2520.78 --> 2521.46]  Active cable
[2521.46 --> 2522.50]  What you do
[2522.50 --> 2522.66]  What you do is
[2522.66 --> 2523.82]  Plug your HDMI in
[2523.82 --> 2524.42]  Then you've got
[2524.42 --> 2526.56]  This active module
[2526.56 --> 2527.62]  Here that needs
[2527.62 --> 2528.44]  What is it
[2528.44 --> 2529.46]  Yeah 5 volt power
[2529.46 --> 2530.64]  Then you run
[2530.64 --> 2531.04]  Ethernet
[2531.04 --> 2531.44]  And you can
[2531.44 --> 2532.04]  Actually run it
[2532.04 --> 2532.96]  Quite a lot longer
[2532.96 --> 2533.46]  Than you would
[2533.46 --> 2534.02]  Be able to
[2534.02 --> 2534.78]  So this guy
[2534.78 --> 2535.34]  Right here
[2535.34 --> 2536.80]  This is the
[2536.80 --> 2537.88]  HL10 I want to
[2537.88 --> 2538.06]  Say
[2538.06 --> 2539.36]  Let me just
[2539.36 --> 2539.86]  Double check
[2539.86 --> 2540.22]  I don't want to
[2540.22 --> 2540.66]  Say anything
[2540.66 --> 2541.46]  Incorrect
[2541.46 --> 2542.66]  Oh yeah
[2542.66 --> 2543.28]  This guy will do
[2543.28 --> 2546.02]  175 feet
[2546.02 --> 2546.54]  With a
[2546.54 --> 2547.28]  1080p
[2547.28 --> 2548.14]  HDMI signal
[2548.14 --> 2549.02]  Over cat5e
[2549.02 --> 2549.78]  Or cat6
[2549.78 --> 2551.04]  With zero
[2551.04 --> 2551.72]  Compression
[2551.72 --> 2552.58]  And they've got
[2552.58 --> 2553.06]  Other stuff
[2553.06 --> 2553.70]  That will actually
[2553.70 --> 2554.08]  Do
[2554.08 --> 2555.76]  Wow
[2555.76 --> 2557.14]  390 feet
[2557.14 --> 2558.24]  Pretty cool
[2558.24 --> 2559.18]  So
[2559.18 --> 2559.78]  Two senders
[2559.78 --> 2560.44]  And two receivers
[2560.44 --> 2560.98]  Each sender
[2560.98 --> 2561.36]  Can be sent
[2561.36 --> 2561.72]  To one of
[2561.72 --> 2562.44]  64 channels
[2562.44 --> 2562.90]  By the buttons
[2562.90 --> 2563.36]  On the front
[2563.36 --> 2564.22]  Or a remote
[2564.22 --> 2565.14]  And you can
[2565.14 --> 2565.64]  Check out
[2565.64 --> 2566.12]  All of this
[2566.12 --> 2566.56]  Oh yeah
[2566.56 --> 2566.96]  That's a
[2566.96 --> 2567.80]  Sleek little monolith
[2567.80 --> 2568.46]  What's this puppy
[2568.46 --> 2568.84]  That's the
[2568.84 --> 2569.32]  Baller one
[2569.32 --> 2569.96]  That's the
[2569.96 --> 2570.72]  Boom
[2570.72 --> 2571.12]  This is the
[2571.12 --> 2571.48]  390
[2571.48 --> 2572.00]  That's the
[2572.00 --> 2572.58]  HDLink
[2572.58 --> 2573.90]  HL21
[2573.90 --> 2574.64]  HDMI
[2574.64 --> 2575.04]  Extender
[2575.04 --> 2575.40]  Plus
[2575.40 --> 2576.12]  Matrix
[2576.12 --> 2576.88]  Over network
[2576.88 --> 2577.44]  Is this the one
[2577.44 --> 2577.62]  That goes
[2577.62 --> 2578.30]  390 feet
[2578.30 --> 2580.16]  So any receiver
[2580.16 --> 2580.88]  Connected to
[2580.88 --> 2581.36]  The channel
[2581.36 --> 2582.02]  That you select
[2582.02 --> 2582.86]  Will receive
[2582.86 --> 2584.04]  The video
[2584.04 --> 2584.34]  Signal
[2584.34 --> 2585.46]  This one is
[2585.46 --> 2586.38]  H.264
[2586.38 --> 2586.84]  Compression
[2586.84 --> 2587.04]  Though
[2587.04 --> 2588.40]  So you can
[2588.40 --> 2588.76]  Check out
[2588.76 --> 2589.42]  These videos
[2589.42 --> 2590.16]  These videos
[2590.16 --> 2590.70]  These products
[2590.70 --> 2591.34]  And more
[2591.34 --> 2591.86]  At the URL
[2591.86 --> 2592.54]  Shown on screen
[2592.54 --> 2592.90]  So that's
[2592.90 --> 2594.14]  Sewelldirect.com
[2594.14 --> 2594.82]  Slash
[2594.82 --> 2595.68]  Linus
[2595.68 --> 2596.52]  It's got that
[2596.52 --> 2597.84]  That new
[2597.84 --> 2598.76]  HDMI over IP
[2598.76 --> 2599.18]  Smell
[2599.18 --> 2600.58]  I actually like
[2600.58 --> 2601.10]  The smell of
[2601.10 --> 2601.82]  New electronics
[2601.82 --> 2602.74]  Give it a sniff
[2602.74 --> 2603.56]  Yep
[2603.56 --> 2605.04]  It's got that
[2605.04 --> 2605.88]  It's that
[2605.88 --> 2607.30]  Fresh PCB smell
[2607.30 --> 2607.86]  You know
[2607.86 --> 2608.20]  When they
[2608.20 --> 2609.14]  When they manufacture
[2609.14 --> 2609.98]  It and then they
[2609.98 --> 2610.98]  Put it into the bag
[2610.98 --> 2612.12]  It stays all
[2612.12 --> 2612.92]  Sealed in there
[2612.92 --> 2613.24]  You know
[2613.24 --> 2614.40]  Even if the bag's
[2614.40 --> 2614.84]  Not sealed
[2614.84 --> 2615.52]  Even if you can't
[2615.52 --> 2616.36]  Get it back in the bag
[2616.36 --> 2616.62]  After
[2616.62 --> 2617.18]  It stays in there
[2617.18 --> 2617.78]  It stays in there
[2617.78 --> 2618.28]  Pretty good
[2618.28 --> 2620.34]  All right
[2620.34 --> 2620.86]  I'm just gonna give up
[2620.86 --> 2621.26]  On that
[2621.26 --> 2623.58]  Good work
[2623.58 --> 2623.90]  James
[2623.90 --> 2626.08]  That's a Tyler
[2626.08 --> 2626.34]  Drop
[2626.34 --> 2628.44]  All right
[2628.44 --> 2629.80]  What else we got
[2629.80 --> 2630.04]  Here
[2630.04 --> 2630.42]  Like what's
[2630.42 --> 2630.72]  Interesting
[2630.72 --> 2631.36]  Did you know
[2631.36 --> 2632.38]  That Google's
[2632.38 --> 2633.16]  First system
[2633.16 --> 2633.64]  On a chip
[2633.64 --> 2634.50]  Designed in house
[2634.50 --> 2635.32]  Is in the
[2635.32 --> 2636.48]  Pixel 2
[2636.48 --> 2637.32]  That you've been
[2637.32 --> 2637.90]  Using all week
[2637.90 --> 2638.76]  No you didn't
[2638.76 --> 2639.20]  Know because they
[2639.20 --> 2640.12]  Just announced it
[2640.12 --> 2640.42]  Now
[2640.42 --> 2641.16]  Really
[2641.16 --> 2641.98]  There's a chip
[2641.98 --> 2642.30]  In there
[2642.30 --> 2642.88]  That you don't
[2642.88 --> 2643.28]  Know about
[2643.28 --> 2646.58]  The Pixel Visual

[2650.20 --> 2651.22]  And the original
[2651.22 --> 2651.86]  Article here
[2651.86 --> 2652.50]  Is from the
[2652.50 --> 2652.94]  Verge
[2652.94 --> 2654.10]  Google's first
[2654.10 --> 2654.80]  Mobile chip
[2654.80 --> 2655.38]  That's not an
[2655.38 --> 2656.16]  SoC
[2656.16 --> 2656.78]  That's an
[2656.78 --> 2657.74]  Image processor
[2657.74 --> 2658.80]  Dang it
[2658.80 --> 2659.56]  What
[2659.56 --> 2660.88]  You're telling me
[2660.88 --> 2661.66]  The Verge is wrong
[2661.66 --> 2662.34]  Hold on a second
[2662.34 --> 2662.80]  What are they
[2662.80 --> 2663.20]  What are they
[2663.20 --> 2663.40]  Saying
[2663.40 --> 2664.00]  Okay hold on
[2664.00 --> 2664.32]  Hold on
[2664.32 --> 2664.70]  Hold on
[2664.70 --> 2666.02]  Pixel Visual
[2666.02 --> 2666.52]  Core
[2666.52 --> 2668.20]  SoC
[2668.20 --> 2670.48]  Purpose
[2670.48 --> 2673.02]  In this case
[2673.02 --> 2673.52]  Accelerated
[2673.52 --> 2673.74]  That
[2673.74 --> 2676.70]  Okay
[2676.70 --> 2677.52]  So my
[2677.52 --> 2677.98]  Understanding
[2677.98 --> 2678.24]  Of the
[2678.24 --> 2678.68]  Definition
[2678.68 --> 2678.92]  Of an
[2678.92 --> 2679.38]  SoC
[2679.38 --> 2679.68]  Is that
[2679.68 --> 2679.92]  It has
[2679.92 --> 2680.20]  To have
[2680.20 --> 2680.72]  Basically
[2680.72 --> 2681.48]  All
[2681.48 --> 2682.00]  The
[2682.00 --> 2682.58]  Elements
[2682.58 --> 2683.52]  Of
[2683.52 --> 2684.12]  A
[2684.12 --> 2687.64]  Of
[2687.64 --> 2687.80]  Like
[2687.80 --> 2688.06]  A more
[2688.06 --> 2688.62]  Traditional
[2688.62 --> 2689.18]  Like
[2689.18 --> 2689.58]  CPU
[2689.58 --> 2690.30]  Motherboard
[2690.30 --> 2691.12]  GPU
[2691.12 --> 2692.12]  IO
[2692.12 --> 2694.86]  Wow
[2694.86 --> 2695.98]  Especially
[2695.98 --> 2696.24]  Among
[2696.24 --> 2696.94]  Academics
[2696.94 --> 2697.68]  SoC
[2697.68 --> 2697.94]  Is
[2697.94 --> 2698.82]  Sociology
[2698.82 --> 2699.32]  Why don't
[2699.32 --> 2699.46]  We
[2699.46 --> 2699.64]  Look
[2699.64 --> 2700.00]  For
[2700.00 --> 2700.40]  A
[2700.40 --> 2700.88]  Much
[2700.88 --> 2701.28]  More
[2701.28 --> 2701.76]  Better
[2701.76 --> 2703.00]  Definition
[2703.00 --> 2705.44]  Wow
[2705.44 --> 2706.70]  It's pronounced
[2706.70 --> 2707.22]  SoC
[2707.22 --> 2715.08]  Yeah I'm gonna have to double check the definition here because I wouldn't think an image processor would be an SOC
[2715.08 --> 2726.68]  So it integrates all components of a computer or other electronic system may contain digital analog mixed signal and often radio frequency functions all on a single substrate
[2726.68 --> 2728.38]  Okay
[2728.38 --> 2728.42]  Okay
[2728.42 --> 2736.32]  Well if they're calling it an SOC maybe there's more to this thing than I necessarily thought but here we go we've actually got a we've got a look at it here
[2736.32 --> 2745.80]  So the coolest aspects of the pixel visual core maybe that it's already in google's devices they both have it built in but laying dormant until activation at some point
[2745.80 --> 2746.20]  Yes
[2746.20 --> 2746.24]  Yes
[2746.24 --> 2759.50]  It's laying dormant until they activate it over the coming months so right now it's used just to process HDR plus stuff way faster faster than you've experienced it
[2759.50 --> 2761.36]  It hasn't been activated yet
[2761.36 --> 2762.50]  Interesting
[2762.50 --> 2773.88]  And that's not all they're actually gonna use it for more applications than just that they haven't told us what but we'll see more image and machine learning enhancements being added to the pixel 2 over the coming months
[2773.88 --> 2777.98]  Very interesting so here's a here's a look at it
[2777.98 --> 2781.80]  So here's the cores here's the link to memory
[2781.80 --> 2784.86]  PCIe
[2784.86 --> 2786.20]  Wow
[2786.20 --> 2788.36]  Huh
[2788.36 --> 2792.84]  It's super interesting to me that they didn't announce this at their made by google hardware event
[2792.84 --> 2797.24]  I guess they didn't have it ready in time but they still ship devices with it
[2797.24 --> 2801.98]  They didn't have the the software implementation ready in time so they just laid low until now
[2801.98 --> 2806.78]  You would have thought they would have at least announced it like when reviewers had hands-on so
[2806.78 --> 2816.16]  So they're saying each of its eight processors has been tailored to handle HDR plus duties resulting in HDR plus performance that is five times faster
[2816.16 --> 2820.58]  At one-tenth of the energy of current of the current implementation
[2820.58 --> 2824.64]  Now when they say current implementation there do you think they mean?
[2825.14 --> 2828.64]  What your pixel can currently do yeah before this is turned on yeah
[2828.64 --> 2835.26]  That's smooth baby, so they say they'll enable it as a developer option in the preview of Android Oreo 8.1
[2835.26 --> 2842.38]  Wow and that there's gonna third-party hat apps will have the ability to handle HDR
[2842.38 --> 2850.06]  photos so we'll see more imaging and machine learning enhancements added to the pixel 2 so the pixel 2 is already getting a pretty good review
[2850.06 --> 2852.70]  That went up on float plane last night
[2852.70 --> 2856.88]  And will be added to YouTube. I think on
[2856.88 --> 2860.00]  So right now
[2860.00 --> 2862.00]  So right now
[2862.00 --> 2864.00]  Float plane has got
[2864.00 --> 2866.00]  Scrapyard Wars parts
[2866.00 --> 2868.00]  2 and 3
[2868.00 --> 2871.36]  Then tomorrow it's gonna get Scrapyard Wars part 4
[2871.36 --> 2874.00]  When YouTube gets part 2
[2874.00 --> 2876.00]  And it's also got
[2876.00 --> 2878.00]  And you're in Scrapyard Wars
[2878.00 --> 2878.48]  Yeah
[2878.48 --> 2879.52]  So am I
[2879.52 --> 2881.12]  You're in Scrapyard Wars?
[2881.62 --> 2882.00]  Kinda
[2882.00 --> 2884.24]  You're in Scrapyard Wars?
[2884.32 --> 2884.90]  What are you talking about?
[2884.90 --> 2885.66]  No, just the voiceover
[2885.66 --> 2887.40]  Oh, you're the voiceover. Oh, that's nice
[2887.40 --> 2891.34]  Yes, listen. Oh, that's it is nice. I like doing that. Listen up
[2891.34 --> 2893.96]  Keep your ears peeled if you can peel an ear
[2893.96 --> 2894.88]  For the
[2894.88 --> 2896.80]  This whimsical voice
[2896.80 --> 2901.36]  So also over there we've got the MSI Vortex G25 review
[2901.36 --> 2906.10]  We've got the Massdrop Vast 35 inch curved gaming monitor. You worked on that one
[2906.64 --> 2910.98]  We've got our video of the... let's have a look here. What else have we got over there?
[2910.98 --> 2918.42]  Oh, LG Wallpaper TV part 2. Wait, that's up on YouTube now. Oh, first ever SLI setup still isn't on YouTube
[2918.42 --> 2924.06]  So with our Voodoo SLI that's over there right now, and I think that pretty much that pretty much covers it
[2924.06 --> 2926.06]  There's some tech quickies as well
[2926.06 --> 2931.32]  All right, what else we got for topics here? Oh, right. If you guys want to know how to join Floatplane
[2931.84 --> 2937.24]  You should probably go check out this link that I'm about to post in the chat. Do you want to move on to our next topic?
[2937.94 --> 2939.94]  I guess so
[2939.94 --> 2943.62]  Sorry, I was just talking to a prime about an upcoming build guide
[2944.74 --> 2952.56]  Oh, yeah, is that the the value value gaming build guide with Ryzen the Ryzen 5 best bang for your buck build bud
[2953.18 --> 2955.18]  Cool, I just want an extra B in there
[2956.06 --> 2961.78]  Yeah, so I may have almost screwed up this build guide, but fortunately
[2961.78 --> 2965.44]  James had the foresight to listen to what I was saying and
[2966.18 --> 2967.24]  Carefully ignore it
[2967.24 --> 2968.44]  Beginner's mind
[2968.44 --> 2974.38]  Beginners beginners. Yeah, you familiar with the concept? No. Is it like beginners luck, but no beginner's mind is when you're like
[2974.38 --> 2980.10]  Because you don't know all the minutiae you kind of don't take things at face value question stuff
[2980.10 --> 2982.10]  Ah
[2982.10 --> 2984.82]  Anyway, this is actually next topic is
[2984.82 --> 2990.76]  total full circle for us because it's a kind of part two of a topic that you and I discussed a couple weeks ago
[2990.76 --> 2994.36]  So what we had discussed was that senator al franken
[2994.36 --> 2998.82]  Submitted like a letter a bunch of questions to Apple about their face ID technology
[2998.82 --> 3003.28]  And now Apple has responded and has answers direct to his questions
[3003.28 --> 3008.56]  And one of them I put in bold because you didn't know how the heck Apple did this and now we get to know
[3008.56 --> 3010.08]  so
[3010.08 --> 3012.82]  Here's just a bunch of both points
[3012.82 --> 3018.54]  I don't want to say al franken's questions because his question will become obvious when you just hear the answer answer number one
[3018.54 --> 3026.70]  Face ID data including mathematical representations of your face is encrypted and only available to the secure enclave
[3026.70 --> 3032.78]  This data never leaves the device. It is not sent to Apple nor is it included in device backups
[3032.78 --> 3033.60]  cool
[3033.60 --> 3040.70]  the air just face face images captured are discarded once the representation is calculated for comparison meaning
[3041.90 --> 3046.78]  That they can never surrender it to the authorities the FBI can't ask for it because Apple just never has it
[3046.78 --> 3048.46]  um
[3048.46 --> 3054.96]  They oh this is cool. So IR and depth images were collected in studies conducted with participants informed consent
[3054.96 --> 3058.66]  So we had we had talked about you know, how exactly did they train the bloody thing?
[3058.66 --> 3061.84]  Because they said they use billions of images and Linus was asking well
[3061.84 --> 3066.24]  Where the heck did they get these billions of images and it turns out they actually just took them themselves?
[3066.86 --> 3071.60]  It's not they haven't said that they've taken taken photos of a billion different people that seems silly
[3071.60 --> 3074.94]  They probably took thousands of photos of hundreds of people. I mean they're Apple
[3074.94 --> 3078.86]  They could conceivably pay every single person on earth like 60 bucks
[3078.86 --> 3084.70]  Hmm to like they could pay a billion people like 60 bucks to take a picture of them
[3084.70 --> 3086.62]  Send us a selfie. Yeah, um
[3086.62 --> 3093.04]  So they took multiple pictures with multiple different types of sensing technology including IR and cool
[3093.04 --> 3095.48]  Presumably up like 360 views so there you go
[3095.48 --> 3098.62]  They are taking security for it pretty darn seriously
[3098.62 --> 3101.76]  Next topic posted by numlock 21 on the forum
[3101.76 --> 3103.82]  this
[3103.82 --> 3105.74]  Oh boy
[3105.74 --> 3107.34]  Someone at asus
[3107.34 --> 3109.68]  Actually, we know specifically who
[3109.68 --> 3113.22]  Andrew woo the rog motherboard product manager
[3113.22 --> 3115.12]  Someone at asus
[3115.12 --> 3120.06]  Andrew woo is uh in a fair bit of trouble right now. This is some serious
[3120.06 --> 3124.58]  Under bus throwing. Yeah, this is some this is some foot in mouth
[3124.58 --> 3129.22]  Being run over by the wheel of the bus with the foot in the mouth
[3129.22 --> 3132.58]  So the head gets run over too and the foot just gets yeah further in there
[3132.58 --> 3137.86]  Yeah, like it like the heels up and the wheel rolls over the heel and jams it through the back of the skull
[3137.86 --> 3142.58]  You can't even gag because there's too much foot. Yeah, um, so in an interview with bit tech
[3143.54 --> 3148.66]  Bit tech basically will we'll give you kind of the the rundown they basically go can you explain in technical detail?
[3148.66 --> 3150.66]  why
[3150.66 --> 3153.96]  coffee lake won't work with z270 motherboards
[3154.90 --> 3160.74]  Mpm the pm goes oh, it's it's intel's decision bit tech says so it's not a physical limitation
[3161.30 --> 3163.30]  Intel said it was to do with the power delivery
[3164.18 --> 3166.18]  PM goes not really it
[3167.30 --> 3170.50]  Power delivery makes a little bit of difference, but not much
[3171.62 --> 3177.78]  So bit tech goes so what are they referring to the the 20 or so unused pins from before he goes yes
[3178.98 --> 3187.30]  So if you wanted an intel let you you could make z270 compatible pm goes yes, but you would also require an upgrade
[3187.94 --> 3193.30]  Uh from the management engine a bios update intel somehow has locked the compatibility
[3195.30 --> 3197.30]  whoa
[3198.26 --> 3199.70]  okay, um
[3199.70 --> 3201.70]  Um
[3201.86 --> 3206.82]  It's basically just comes down to stability then and so just did this for this ability
[3207.06 --> 3210.26]  So this is one of those situations where I run into trouble
[3210.90 --> 3215.14]  Because I know things that were told to me off the record
[3216.34 --> 3218.18]  Well, well, no
[3218.18 --> 3222.98]  I'm just it's not about that. I'm just messing with you. I know things off the record
[3222.98 --> 3223.94]  That
[3226.42 --> 3229.30]  They're they're not they don't conflict with any of this information
[3230.10 --> 3230.50]  Because
[3231.30 --> 3236.66]  What he said was that here? Maybe maybe I can help the audience infer
[3237.62 --> 3241.94]  Based on what he said because all the information is really in there if you read between the lines
[3242.90 --> 3246.50]  So intel said it was to do with the power delivery and he says
[3246.50 --> 3250.34]  Not really it makes a little bit of difference
[3253.06 --> 3255.38]  They did change something
[3257.22 --> 3258.50]  Why did they do it?
[3258.50 --> 3264.90]  Surely intel would have saved themselves some cost and changed nothing
[3266.02 --> 3271.86]  If they didn't feel like they had to change something for some reason
[3273.78 --> 3280.34]  Because if we're going to attack this problem from the tinfoil hat mindset of
[3280.90 --> 3285.70]  These money-grubbing companies don't want to spend any money and they want to take ours
[3285.70 --> 3289.38]  Surely we can all agree that intel would have done
[3289.94 --> 3297.06]  Absolutely nothing if there wasn't some reason that they perceived that they had to do something
[3298.26 --> 3300.26]  So they did something
[3302.26 --> 3306.34]  It according to this interview had to do with the power delivery
[3308.82 --> 3313.30]  Also according to this interview asus could make it compatible
[3313.30 --> 3316.10]  If intel wasn't locking it out
[3317.30 --> 3318.26]  For some reason
[3319.46 --> 3321.62]  Maybe related to why they did something
[3322.66 --> 3323.94]  It's all in the interview
[3323.94 --> 3326.98]  I haven't said anything that I wasn't supposed to pass along
[3326.98 --> 3330.82]  Is there any possible way that we could uh like hack it and make it work?
[3330.82 --> 3331.14]  No
[3331.14 --> 3331.86]  Okay
[3331.86 --> 3336.10]  Even asus can't do it because intel would have to update me
[3336.50 --> 3336.82]  Okay
[3337.38 --> 3338.02]  Second question
[3338.02 --> 3338.90]  And you need a bios update
[3338.90 --> 3340.90]  Do you think that uh
[3340.90 --> 3343.70]  Andrew woo here kind of backpedals at the end where he says
[3344.18 --> 3347.06]  uh, you know, it's it's not that big of a deal anyway because people who bought
[3347.94 --> 3349.94]  Z270 just 10 months ago when it came out
[3349.94 --> 3353.14]  They're probably not likely to be the type of consumer who's going to upgrade anyway
[3353.62 --> 3355.62]  It's people with older systems who are going to upgrade
[3355.62 --> 3358.50]  So to me it really has nothing to do with that because
[3359.22 --> 3360.26]  you know when um
[3361.06 --> 3362.18]  When kaby lake came out
[3363.22 --> 3364.98]  You know for a long time
[3364.98 --> 3369.94]  Once intel launches a new cpu for a long time sometimes like right through the entire time it's available
[3370.26 --> 3372.50]  You can buy the last generation
[3372.98 --> 3378.66]  Chipset which actually usually has the same features because they don't change much if they don't have to
[3379.14 --> 3382.26]  Um you can you can buy those old ones for a little bit cheaper
[3382.66 --> 3387.22]  So if you wanted a z170 board with a 7700k you would get
[3388.18 --> 3393.54]  Overclocking unlocked for your k-series chip you'd get just as many sata ports you'd get this you get that
[3393.54 --> 3395.30]  And
[3395.30 --> 3397.38]  Overall performance would in most cases
[3398.90 --> 3404.98]  Be very similar and someone's car alarm just go off. Oh, no, someone set off the actual alarm. Is that in 101? Or is that here?
[3406.42 --> 3407.62]  Do you mind investigating?
[3408.34 --> 3409.78]  Thank you, sir
[3409.78 --> 3413.62]  The alarms are going off in here. Uh, yeah, so sorry about that guys we get installed
[3414.42 --> 3416.42]  um
[3417.14 --> 3419.94]  This is a job for laser james
[3419.94 --> 3421.46]  Ha ha
[3422.34 --> 3423.54]  They laughed at me
[3425.86 --> 3427.94]  They're still laughing at you. That's why i'm here
[3431.86 --> 3432.34]  Thank you
[3433.62 --> 3435.22]  It looks like my work here is done
[3436.98 --> 3438.02]  Good work laser james
[3439.86 --> 3443.22]  I have an unblockable soil so anyway um
[3443.22 --> 3445.22]  Um
[3445.22 --> 3447.86]  From this interview reading between the lines of this interview
[3449.30 --> 3450.98]  They probably could have made it compatible
[3451.62 --> 3460.26]  There is some reason related to the power delivery that they decided not to and not only decided not to but also decided to do actual work
[3460.66 --> 3461.94]  on z370
[3461.94 --> 3463.70]  At great expense
[3463.70 --> 3464.98]  Now
[3464.98 --> 3469.06]  Do I necessarily think then that this makes intel some kind of a white knight?
[3469.78 --> 3470.02]  No
[3470.82 --> 3475.62]  Because what they have also done is they've released only a single 300 series chipset
[3477.30 --> 3480.74]  Z370 the highest priced one in their stack right
[3480.90 --> 3484.02]  So you don't even have the option to buy you know like uh
[3484.58 --> 3485.46]  uh
[3485.46 --> 3492.10]  An 8400 for example and pair it with a cheapo board because it because it doesn't it's not unlocked for overclocking anyway
[3492.66 --> 3499.54]  So yeah, that's pretty greasy. So are they clearly trying to extract more value from the customer?
[3499.54 --> 3503.06]  Yeah, if they felt bad about it, they would have done like the bare minimum like just like
[3504.42 --> 3506.42]  Almost at cost okay like eating it
[3506.42 --> 3509.14]  So if they had no margin on them on the mobos
[3509.78 --> 3514.34]  Then all right, so they're they're they're clearly trying to you know, you know
[3514.34 --> 3521.14]  Do corporate things, you know the rise, you know average cart price or whatever the those metrics that e-tailors look for
[3522.10 --> 3525.54]  The drive attach, you know that kind of stuff they're clearly doing that
[3526.10 --> 3530.10]  But i'm also not necessarily one of the people holding a torch going
[3530.66 --> 3532.98]  You should be able to plug a coffee lake into a z270
[3533.38 --> 3538.26]  Because there does appear to be an actual physical change that they made that
[3538.90 --> 3542.82]  They felt was necessary for the most stable and optimal operation
[3543.30 --> 3544.34]  um
[3544.34 --> 3550.26]  Honestly, I think one of the big reasons that we only got z370 is intel was fully aware that coffee lake supply was going to be
[3550.82 --> 3553.14]  extraordinarily limited and they figured well
[3553.86 --> 3557.14]  If people like if we can't keep them on shelves anyway
[3557.78 --> 3564.10]  Then we might as well sell them to the people that we're going to go out there and spend the most on the best chipset and the top of the line
[3564.10 --> 3565.30]  Well, that's not what he's saying
[3565.30 --> 3570.18]  He's saying that people who are just ready to upgrade who didn't upgrade to z270
[3571.78 --> 3573.14]  Can upgrade now
[3573.14 --> 3574.74]  But they're gonna have to do that to great expense
[3575.14 --> 3580.26]  Yeah, I mean that's that's that's his whole thing and i'm not i'm making my i'm drawing my own conclusions here
[3580.26 --> 3582.50]  About what exactly intel was doing with their strategy
[3583.14 --> 3586.34]  So i'll i'll leave it to you guys to sort of come up with your own uh
[3587.30 --> 3591.86]  Your own answers here, but I do want to show you your own answers to something we discussed earlier
[3591.86 --> 3597.54]  Yeah, let's go ahead and pull up our micro transactions poll from earlier in the show
[3598.26 --> 3602.90]  50 dollar game how much is it acceptable to spend per year on micro transactions?
[3602.90 --> 3606.18]  So first uh alex how much per year is it acceptable to spend?
[3606.82 --> 3613.46]  On a 50 dollar game nothing nothing okay, so you are actually the second most popular answer
[3615.46 --> 3620.98]  38 of our voters think it's okay to spend up to ten dollars on a 50 dollar game
[3621.62 --> 3625.70]  So like a little treat just a little something for yourself some horse armor, you know yeah
[3626.34 --> 3635.94]  Um like a 30 dollar game sorry, you'd do that in a 30 dollar game 30 dollars canadian that's like that's like six how many rubles is that?
[3637.70 --> 3642.82]  Um, okay 31 of you are saying zero dollars period
[3643.54 --> 3649.86]  22 of you 50 bucks and 10 of you must be like some kind of mega ballers
[3649.86 --> 3657.38]  Because you think it's okay to spend between 50 to over a hundred dollars on micro transactions in your game. Are you for real?
[3658.26 --> 3662.26]  I can't even imagine spending that kind of money on micro transactions mlg baby
[3662.90 --> 3664.90]  You're not hardcore
[3665.14 --> 3668.50]  Yeah, that much is that much is I mean, I I didn't even spend that much on my car
[3669.46 --> 3671.86]  Like look at my car. It's not even worth a hundred dollars
[3672.74 --> 3675.38]  Seriously, I took it and I tried to trade it in new straw pool
[3675.38 --> 3678.10]  New straw pool. How much would you pay for lanus's car?
[3680.74 --> 3682.74]  I bet I bet you could get more than a hundred bucks
[3683.70 --> 3687.30]  Okay, so that's okay. That's a bit of that there's an issue with that though
[3688.02 --> 3690.58]  You're taking all those phones. What's that one on the bottom?
[3690.58 --> 3697.22]  Oh the pixel. Oh, okay, so hey guys, this is another cool teaser. So um
[3698.02 --> 3701.78]  Those of you who aren't subscribed over on float plane won't actually know this yet
[3702.18 --> 3705.78]  But Brandon here is going to be working on a first for our channel
[3706.42 --> 3709.70]  A smartphone camera roundup that why are you what?
[3710.42 --> 3711.30]  Why are you doing this?
[3711.30 --> 3718.26]  This is this is how I'm going to be on the show now. You're behind the mic. Yeah, that's good. Stay there stay there because those are those are so ridiculous
[3718.26 --> 3725.30]  So anyway, um, I've never really done in-depth phone camera testing because frankly
[3727.46 --> 3730.34]  I mean you're not a camera person. I'm not qualified. Thank you, Brandon
[3730.66 --> 3732.10]  um, so so
[3732.98 --> 3735.54]  with the pixel 2 and the iphone 8 and
[3736.82 --> 3741.46]  To a lesser extent the s8, but definitely the node 8 the camera was like
[3742.02 --> 3747.30]  The thing they wanted to talk about so brandon's going to be doing a dedicated video sometime probably next week on float plane
[3747.30 --> 3749.78]  Hopefully, um, hopefully maybe the following week
[3750.26 --> 3755.30]  Really picking these phones apart and figuring out which one is more camera for your dollar
[3755.78 --> 3761.54]  Attached to a phone and you're throwing a dslr into the mix aren't you? Yes. Oh boy. Well, we'll see. Oh boy
[3763.22 --> 3768.66]  Many many use cases. Is that almost a separate video? I don't know the whole like should you still buy you know
[3769.06 --> 3773.14]  A $600 $700 dslr. I want to talk about that. You want to talk about it?
[3773.14 --> 3776.58]  Maybe we should just bring you on for like a wan show segment or something. I don't know
[3777.22 --> 3782.18]  You know my favorite part about this whole thing is Brandon hates smartphone camera commentary
[3782.58 --> 3787.22]  He hates when people talk about it. He hates when there's videos about the iphone camera. He hates it now
[3787.22 --> 3789.22]  He has to do it to clarify
[3789.78 --> 3792.82]  I do not hate the iphone and smartphone cameras being good
[3793.06 --> 3799.46]  I do however hate the thousands of articles I've seen over the years about things that are shot on the iphone being
[3799.46 --> 3804.66]  Making making it seem like the iphone was the best tool for I get I get it
[3804.82 --> 3808.42]  It's good enough for this use case and it can work perfect
[3808.98 --> 3809.54]  but
[3810.82 --> 3816.10]  There is no one who can sit there and tell me that the iphone is a better camera in most use cases
[3816.42 --> 3821.30]  For a professional situation brandon just your pills. I can tell you that I won't have any credibility
[3821.54 --> 3823.06]  But I can tell you that just
[3823.86 --> 3825.86]  Just to get his blood pressure up
[3825.86 --> 3830.18]  He's not even gonna make it into work on monday. He'll have had like four heart attacks
[3831.38 --> 3835.38]  Also, I just realized why aren't we calling the pixel xl the pixel
[3836.42 --> 3840.98]  The pixel the pixel the pixel the pixel double xl all right
[3841.46 --> 3845.22]  So thanks for watching guys. We will see you again next week same bad time same bad channel
[3845.46 --> 3848.74]  And yes, i'm really ending the show on that terrible joke deal with it
[3849.38 --> 3851.38]  Oh, man
[3851.38 --> 3858.74]  I got the end of show on even worse or joke
[3862.26 --> 3864.26]  That's the baddest grammar
[3864.26 --> 3872.26]  I know
[3872.26 --> 3874.26]  I just totally found out
[3875.30 --> 3878.34]  Yeah halo you can just host a dedicated server we should totally set one up
[3879.30 --> 3881.30]  But i mean like you don't need to have phone to base game
[3881.86 --> 3883.14]  You just can't play the campaign
[3883.14 --> 3884.42]  We don't really discuss
[3886.10 --> 3887.94]  That we're still live you know
[3887.94 --> 3889.22]  Oh really? I didn't know that
[3890.74 --> 3895.62]  And if we set up a server it will be a legit game server so no bad bad Alex
[3895.62 --> 3897.62]  And then
