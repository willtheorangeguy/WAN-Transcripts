[0.00 → 2.92] Are we live?
[3.04 → 4.06] And we're live!
[4.14 → 5.96] All right!
[6.12 → 6.72] No way!
[7.26 → 11.38] Welcome to the WAN show, where I use two mice!
[12.34 → 13.38] I don't use any.
[13.54 → 14.50] And two computers!
[15.20 → 15.88] I use one.
[16.88 → 18.32] You hit the mic, that probably sounded terrible.
[18.34 → 19.26] I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[19.36 → 21.34] I hit the mic, I hit the keyboard over here.
[21.94 → 24.00] I'm not good at using the computers.
[24.42 → 26.60] I'm just, I'm trying to use the computers.
[26.78 → 28.34] It's basically the whole channel.
[30.00 → 32.42] I think it's a little bit of both.
[32.52 → 35.00] Yeah, it's a combination of things.
[35.22 → 38.34] We have a great show for you guys today.
[38.52 → 40.10] The best show, the greatest.
[40.10 → 41.12] Pretty much the best show.
[42.14 → 46.86] Twitch opens up its money-making tools to non-partnered channels.
[47.88 → 49.66] I don't know about Twitch, but...
[49.66 → 50.42] Not all of them.
[50.48 → 56.32] I don't know if I'd open up my money-making tools to non-partners, if you know what I mean.
[56.32 → 56.68] Wow.
[57.08 → 57.46] Wow.
[57.46 → 60.66] Only in approved circumstances, which is what they're doing.
[60.80 → 61.30] That's right.
[61.34 → 62.26] You still have to apply.
[62.36 → 63.14] With a condom.
[63.40 → 63.78] Yes.
[64.00 → 69.96] There's a rumour that Google is planning to add a native ad blocker to Chrome.
[70.98 → 71.88] Super sick.
[72.00 → 77.30] Also, you can flash, possibly, your Radeon RX 470 towards a 570.
[77.52 → 79.58] Because this seems to happen every time.
[79.66 → 80.52] The towards is weird.
[80.78 → 81.50] To a 570.
[81.50 → 82.14] I changed it.
[82.14 → 84.04] I included it because I was like, ah.
[84.32 → 84.60] No.
[84.74 → 85.00] No.
[85.00 → 86.76] You can't flash something towards.
[87.44 → 89.42] I mean, I could flash something towards us.
[90.22 → 92.32] It ends up being a 565.
[92.82 → 94.32] Because it was on the way.
[94.32 → 95.52] It was almost there.
[95.52 → 96.88] Just didn't quite make it.
[96.88 → 98.26] The 569.
[98.46 → 98.82] Yeah.
[99.22 → 99.40] Yeah.
[99.40 → 99.70] Okay?
[100.16 → 103.62] Because it kind of got backwards at the last second there.
[103.62 → 103.92] That should be the official name for this.
[104.08 → 105.46] The 569.
[105.54 → 105.90] Yeah.
[105.90 → 107.12] I'm totally down.
[107.60 → 108.54] That's what it should be called.
[108.64 → 110.00] Anyway, Valve asks for.
[110.58 → 112.14] As long as you're the other way.
[115.56 → 116.40] Oh, man.
[116.52 → 120.10] Valve asks for phone numbers to confirm Data 2 player identities.
[120.28 → 120.72] Wow.
[121.00 → 121.76] For ranked matches.
[121.76 → 129.48] That's a big step forward for the removal of anonymity from online gaming.
[129.68 → 135.06] And by step forward, to be clear, I'm not going to say if I'm for or against the move.
[135.06 → 138.56] I mean, it is a step forward towards that particular end goal.
[138.80 → 140.28] We can discuss it more later.
[140.42 → 142.84] First, you have to sit through the intro with sound.
[143.46 → 144.08] With sound.
[146.26 → 147.58] The new revelation.
[147.58 → 167.90] Savage jerky.
[167.90 → 168.76] I already ate some.
[169.42 → 170.76] Oh, you bastard.
[170.98 → 172.30] You're cheating the system.
[173.80 → 174.46] Fresh bugs.
[174.46 → 175.12] Fresh bugs.
[177.12 → 178.48] I already did some accounting.
[179.82 → 181.88] I saw, okay, I saw the habanero one.
[182.10 → 184.62] And I was like, last time, it just lasted forever anyway.
[185.26 → 188.32] So, I can just eat that one and no one's really going to care.
[188.88 → 190.60] Because it just burns everyone else out.
[190.70 → 191.28] Now it's open.
[191.56 → 191.74] Yeah.
[192.46 → 195.70] You know, everybody else stuck with the system.
[195.70 → 196.86] Every single other person.
[197.00 → 198.46] Every single other person.
[198.46 → 199.22] To be fair.
[199.40 → 200.92] This is the reason.
[201.42 → 204.44] This is the reason that we're pushing him out.
[205.78 → 207.04] Because I eat the jerky.
[207.10 → 208.76] To his development project.
[209.02 → 209.36] Okay?
[210.50 → 212.18] If you were wondering why.
[212.44 → 214.20] I ate dad's jerky, and he kicked me out of the house.
[214.32 → 214.88] That's right.
[216.54 → 218.48] And you deserved it, and you know it.
[218.60 → 218.80] Yeah.
[219.10 → 219.26] Yeah.
[219.72 → 220.74] Time to pay rent.
[220.74 → 223.22] All right.
[223.44 → 227.88] So, let's go ahead and why don't we jump right into our first topic here.
[227.98 → 230.24] Let's have some fun here.
[230.72 → 236.52] Let's get right into Twitch opening up its money making tools to non-partner channels.
[236.52 → 239.70] So, the original article here is from TechCrunch.
[239.82 → 240.40] Oh, didn't that one?
[241.46 → 264.38] And the funny thing about this is it is right on the heels of YouTube actually closing down access to their ad generating, money generating tools from folks who aren't abiding by an advertiser friendly sort of unspoken content guideline.
[264.92 → 265.10] Yeah.
[265.10 → 269.82] Now, I'm not saying that this is an apples to apples comparison by any stretch of the imagination.
[270.28 → 277.06] But if Twitch was looking for a good time to kind of, you know, open up the floodgates and try and-
[277.06 → 279.06] Be more friendly to creators that want to do it as a job.
[279.12 → 280.58] Try and be more creator friendly.
[280.76 → 283.76] This is, uh, this is as good a time as any.
[283.84 → 284.86] There are some interesting things.
[284.92 → 286.20] It's not full partnership.
[286.66 → 292.86] So, if you're looking at partners right now and being like, oh, yes, I'll be able to become that or my friend will be able to become that or whatever.
[292.86 → 294.82] It's not quite the same.
[294.82 → 296.00] You won't get everything.
[296.20 → 296.22] Yeah.
[296.22 → 299.02] Why don't you start with a rundown of the benefits that partners get?
[299.10 → 299.70] You're partnered, right?
[299.70 → 300.20] Partners, yeah.
[300.32 → 305.52] So, partners have, you have a subscription button, which is like the bread and butter of being a partner.
[305.72 → 307.32] And these guys will not get that.
[307.40 → 313.68] A subscription button is $5 a month, and you get a chat badge showing that you're a subscriber.
[313.82 → 316.56] If you subscribe for a really long time, that chat badge can get upgraded.
[316.56 → 319.70] You get special emojis in the chat.
[319.70 → 321.18] All that kind of fun stuff.
[321.38 → 328.92] I think there's been some like potential leak kind of stuff where people are talking about how there might be different tiers of subscriptions in the future.
[329.06 → 330.08] But who knows?
[330.08 → 335.30] Then there's cheering with bits, which both of these tiers will be able to get.
[335.84 → 338.58] Cheering with bits is like there's always been donating to streamers.
[338.80 → 344.50] This is a way to donate to streamers through the Twitch platform instead of through something that the streamer sets up.
[344.94 → 349.14] It shows up in the chat with a little animated thing depending on how many bits you actually donated.
[349.14 → 354.62] And streamers can tie it in to actually have it pop up on the stream and play a sound notification or whatever.
[354.74 → 355.68] You will get that.
[355.98 → 358.18] It's a way of virtual tipping, they call it.
[359.06 → 367.08] And I believe, yeah, when you cheer, you get a chat badge that slowly upgrades over time depending on how much you've cheered.
[367.08 → 368.30] I'm going to be honest with you.
[368.50 → 369.94] I'm streaming on Twitch right now.
[370.98 → 372.42] I do not get that.
[372.96 → 373.64] The cheer thing?
[373.84 → 374.50] Yeah, I don't get it.
[374.50 → 379.20] I don't get why it incentivizes people to donate more.
[379.20 → 380.32] People like shiny things.
[380.62 → 380.96] I know.
[381.10 → 381.62] I don't get it.
[381.74 → 392.08] And like, okay, another one is if you cheer and comment in the same line, the partner can have a thing where that gets pinned to the top of the chat.
[392.34 → 395.46] The most recent cheer can get pinned to the top of the chat.
[395.46 → 406.06] So if you want your comment to be seen by everyone for sure in a chat with comments flying by, you add like a little bit of money to it, and it gets pinned, so everyone sees it.
[407.64 → 411.80] I don't personally care about commenting on Twitch, so it's not for me.
[412.04 → 414.60] I only comment to troll you on your stream occasionally.
[414.60 → 417.64] When you're not even listening, so I can't even respond.
[417.64 → 424.32] Well, I'm usually, okay, the only time I have enough time to sit and watch your stream, no offence.
[425.88 → 426.62] It's okay.
[426.62 → 438.00] The only time that there isn't something, anything that's a higher priority for me is when I'm like rocking the baby to sleep.
[438.32 → 438.48] Yeah.
[439.08 → 439.32] Yeah.
[439.84 → 446.18] And I'm just like, yep, it is not important if what I'm doing right now happens quickly.
[446.18 → 452.22] So you're muted AF, and I'm just like, lol, I'm in the chat.
[452.50 → 452.86] Just trolling.
[453.04 → 456.76] And then everyone freaks out, and then they're trying to like to communicate for both of us.
[457.10 → 459.84] So the chat starts trying to talk for me to you.
[460.42 → 463.02] And then sometimes like that gets really weird.
[463.10 → 464.22] Meanwhile, there's the delay.
[464.54 → 464.76] Yeah.
[465.36 → 466.28] So there's that.
[466.30 → 468.00] Which these days can be really long.
[468.04 → 468.82] Yeah, or not.
[469.24 → 471.42] Or not existent almost at all.
[471.44 → 472.72] Yeah, so it's really confusing.
[472.82 → 473.56] It's very weird.
[473.56 → 479.30] So can people pin a so can people cheer for us like here?
[479.48 → 480.50] So I believe.
[480.64 → 481.26] Are we partnered?
[481.66 → 482.72] We are partnered for sure.
[483.00 → 484.20] We might not have that enabled.
[484.70 → 485.06] Okay.
[485.58 → 487.26] And that would be just because like.
[487.26 → 487.74] I don't see anyone cheering.
[487.86 → 490.42] I'm an idiot and I don't know how the dashboard works basically.
[491.20 → 492.34] Well, not the dashboard.
[492.42 → 495.28] Well, there was that one feature that you're like, yeah, you're going to need to turn that on.
[495.32 → 495.66] And I'm like.
[495.66 → 499.46] And you're like, yeah, I'll do it for you.
[499.96 → 502.02] Well, we also had the auto hosting thing enabled.
[502.18 → 502.54] Is that what you're talking about?
[502.54 → 502.90] Yeah, yeah.
[502.96 → 503.44] That's the one.
[503.52 → 503.92] That's the one.
[504.30 → 505.42] No, there's been two.
[505.58 → 506.72] I don't remember what the other one was.
[506.92 → 508.68] I don't remember exactly where it is, but it's not dashboard.
[508.84 → 509.40] Partner settings.
[509.40 → 510.06] It's probably there.
[510.96 → 511.76] Partner settings.
[512.96 → 514.18] Subscriber only chat.
[514.44 → 514.76] Exclude.
[515.22 → 515.88] Custom cheer mode.
[515.88 → 516.92] Enable cheering with bits.
[517.00 → 517.36] Enable cheering with bits.
[517.36 → 518.20] So it's disabled.
[518.20 → 519.16] So it's disabled.
[519.28 → 520.72] We have everything disabled.
[521.66 → 526.94] We have royalty tax and service tax disabled.
[527.30 → 527.82] An interview.
[528.06 → 528.86] What the heck is that?
[529.14 → 530.98] We have subscriber only chat disabled.
[531.30 → 534.38] We have excluding subscribers from slow mode disabled.
[534.62 → 536.02] We have cheering with bits disabled.
[536.14 → 537.66] A custom cheer mode disabled.
[538.14 → 539.60] Bits threshold settings disabled.
[539.76 → 541.14] Chat badge settings disabled.
[541.50 → 543.40] Restrict access to archives disabled.
[544.46 → 546.80] Ad free for subscribers is enabled.
[546.80 → 548.22] Heck yeah.
[548.30 → 552.20] And our affiliate options are disabled as well as our earning revenue from game sales.
[552.36 → 553.56] You might want to turn the bits one on.
[553.66 → 555.58] We are clearly not doing this right.
[555.70 → 560.32] We must be the worst partnered Twitch streamers on the entire platform.
[560.52 → 560.90] We're pretty bad.
[561.04 → 564.12] I think you're also supposed to stream a minimum of three times a week.
[564.30 → 565.84] That clearly never happens.
[567.14 → 569.90] We're like never even on time, let alone three times a week.
[570.12 → 574.90] So yeah, maybe not the like what people should aspire to be.
[574.90 → 575.54] Yeah.
[575.54 → 577.32] Okay.
[577.56 → 579.72] So this just in.
[580.50 → 583.20] We are not what people should aspire to be.
[583.80 → 584.56] More at 11.
[584.80 → 585.62] Stream less.
[585.80 → 587.06] Don't stream for as long.
[587.22 → 588.36] Don't stream games.
[589.68 → 592.66] Have all the money making stuff.
[592.82 → 592.94] Yeah.
[593.16 → 593.72] Turn it off.
[593.72 → 594.64] Turn that shit off.
[596.70 → 600.16] A lot of subscribers, but like don't really worry about giving them anything cool.
[600.16 → 600.78] Apparently.
[600.94 → 601.12] Yeah.
[601.22 → 604.68] And pre-record last week's WAN show.
[604.92 → 605.40] That was close.
[605.50 → 605.82] That's right.
[605.88 → 607.02] I almost got the lens.
[607.16 → 609.14] That would have been terrible, actually.
[611.58 → 614.52] You'll have cheering with bits if you get into the affiliate program.
[614.78 → 616.60] I believe there's also ads.
[616.86 → 617.00] Right.
[617.00 → 618.44] So you can have advertisements on the channel.
[618.56 → 619.52] Those roll and give you some money.
[619.52 → 620.78] But that is very low.
[621.04 → 627.38] And then if you are planning to live stream this week's WAN show, make sure you change
[627.38 → 629.04] your clock settings.
[629.52 → 629.60] Oh.
[630.00 → 630.48] Ah.
[630.62 → 631.30] See that?
[631.38 → 631.76] See that?
[631.84 → 634.82] Changing the clock settings for this clearly pre-recorded show.
[635.08 → 635.44] Ha ha.
[635.44 → 637.76] Fake live stream.
[637.96 → 638.36] Yes.
[638.78 → 642.92] And then you don't get any weird issues with like the computer not being able to do things
[642.92 → 645.66] on the internet because the time code is so wrong and stuff because you're just local
[645.66 → 646.18] recording.
[646.32 → 646.78] That's right.
[646.80 → 648.82] Then you just set it back to normal and upload it later.
[648.88 → 649.66] No problem.
[649.82 → 650.32] Easy mode.
[650.32 → 650.62] All right.
[650.68 → 655.10] So anyway, in a nutshell, this new tier will be called affiliates.
[655.24 → 655.40] Yeah.
[655.78 → 657.68] Not partners.
[658.24 → 658.56] Okay.
[658.72 → 662.76] It's almost cooler for partners because partners get stuff like a verified chat badge.
[662.76 → 663.20] Yeah.
[663.20 → 665.80] Which will set them apart when they go into other people's chats.
[666.18 → 669.06] And it will still be on an invitation basis.
[669.06 → 672.16] So based on a number of criteria including time spent streaming.
[672.16 → 672.38] Oh.
[673.64 → 673.80] Oh.
[673.80 → 674.26] Oh.
[674.84 → 675.28] Oh.
[675.28 → 675.48] Sorry.
[676.04 → 679.22] Time spent streaming, viewership numbers, and follower count.
[679.30 → 680.76] I think those last two were pretty good, right?
[680.84 → 681.02] Yeah.
[681.12 → 682.18] We're doing pretty solid on that.
[682.18 → 682.20] Okay.
[682.20 → 682.42] Okay.
[682.56 → 682.72] Yeah.
[683.74 → 684.34] All right.
[684.34 → 690.94] So it's an easier way to start kind of getting your foot in the door because right now the threshold
[690.94 → 697.02] for becoming a partner is very hard to hit when the discoverability of Twitch's platform
[697.02 → 699.30] being not a partner is really rough.
[699.44 → 699.94] Is terrible.
[700.06 → 700.22] Yeah.
[700.30 → 700.50] Right.
[700.72 → 701.32] That's fair.
[701.66 → 706.16] Like unless you're like the first person streaming some hot new game and even then you've got
[706.16 → 706.80] like an hour.
[707.18 → 707.42] Yeah.
[707.46 → 708.48] You really don't have that long.
[708.48 → 708.64] Yeah.
[708.64 → 711.32] And you need to be like perfect at it often.
[711.68 → 711.86] Yeah.
[711.94 → 712.94] To really draw people in.
[713.04 → 717.78] Like there's a few success stories where someone gets like a weird early access code.
[717.86 → 719.48] So they get like a day ahead of everyone else.
[719.48 → 720.90] So they're further in the game than everyone.
[721.10 → 722.32] So then they get a bunch of viewers.
[722.58 → 723.08] I see.
[723.20 → 727.46] Or like a bunch of servers goes down, but the one they're connected to is able to stay up.
[727.52 → 728.18] So they get a bunch of it.
[728.22 → 730.58] Like there's, there's weird ways that people make it.
[730.58 → 735.62] Twitch accidentally promoting small time streamers since 2000, whatever.
[735.74 → 736.46] It hasn't been that long.
[736.46 → 740.84] I've talked to you about this, and it's, it's hard because, um, with, with something like
[740.84 → 746.36] YouTube, you get off boarded every about five, 10 minutes because the video will end
[746.36 → 748.88] and it's going to suggest a bunch of other videos.
[748.88 → 749.44] Right.
[749.56 → 750.34] So you'll get off board.
[750.42 → 755.90] You might continue purposefully going for their videos, but it's making a conscious decision
[755.90 → 758.70] over and over and over again every five to 10 minutes with Twitch.
[758.78 → 761.14] You click on one person, and then it tries to keep you there.
[762.84 → 766.72] So it's, it's actually harder for them to try to spread their users out.
[766.72 → 770.92] And then if you want to go find one of these little smaller streamers, you're going to be
[770.92 → 772.22] going to some game.
[772.48 → 776.26] And then you'll be like scrolling through pages and pages of all things that look the same.
[776.26 → 776.44] Yeah.
[776.44 → 776.70] Basically.
[776.70 → 777.92] Just like thumbnails.
[778.20 → 778.40] Yeah.
[778.44 → 779.02] Of a game.
[779.24 → 779.50] Yeah.
[779.60 → 780.16] Cause like.
[780.82 → 782.04] That's pretty much it.
[782.10 → 782.84] That's what's going on.
[782.90 → 783.04] Yeah.
[783.04 → 784.46] Because you can't put boobs in it anymore.
[784.60 → 785.56] So what are you supposed to do?
[785.64 → 786.68] They're guns.
[786.82 → 789.78] Like I can't, I can't even like, am I even allowed to wear a low cut?
[790.10 → 790.96] I think that.
[791.08 → 791.44] Yes.
[791.56 → 792.26] This is okay.
[792.36 → 793.22] You're not allowed to show a nip.
[793.60 → 794.10] No nip.
[794.40 → 794.76] No nip.
[794.86 → 796.58] So I could even, I could even like.
[797.26 → 798.18] That's, that's probably fine.
[798.22 → 799.22] That's probably fine too.
[799.44 → 801.42] I think mid-drift is also not allowed.
[801.58 → 802.42] You know what's kind of funny is.
[802.54 → 803.66] But up here is probably cool.
[803.76 → 804.98] Depending on the compression.
[805.98 → 810.92] The, the, this kind of like, this kind of wispy hair could even look kind of like a shadowed
[810.92 → 812.70] between boob kind of cleavage area.
[812.70 → 816.46] Why do people watch this show?
[816.92 → 817.64] Giant pecs.
[817.72 → 817.88] Yeah.
[817.98 → 818.68] Giant pecs.
[818.68 → 819.24] That's what's going on.
[819.24 → 820.60] That's what's going on over here.
[821.08 → 823.52] Giant, uh, giant, uh.
[823.62 → 824.10] Lewd.
[824.48 → 824.88] Lewd.
[827.14 → 828.98] We put the lewd in lewd.
[830.98 → 834.94] All right.
[834.98 → 835.66] Another news.
[835.90 → 836.24] Google.
[836.60 → 837.78] This is rumoured.
[838.10 → 840.98] The original post on our forum was by dead eyed psycho.
[841.32 → 842.34] Thank you for posting that.
[842.34 → 849.72] Google is rumoured to be adding a native ad blocker to Chrome.
[850.32 → 853.18] Can you even imagine?
[853.58 → 857.52] Honestly, after you read through this, it completely makes sense.
[858.04 → 858.34] Okay.
[858.42 → 858.68] Hit me.
[858.70 → 862.58] What they're targeting is stuff like pop-up ads that don't go away for a timer.
[863.76 → 864.30] Okay.
[864.38 → 865.82] Ads that autoplay videos.
[865.98 → 866.22] Sure.
[866.44 → 867.94] Ads that autoplay sound.
[867.94 → 874.66] They're, they're, they're only targeting ad blocking for things that they view as like kind of heinous.
[874.84 → 875.24] Intrusive.
[875.48 → 875.68] Yeah.
[876.00 → 876.44] Intrusive.
[876.44 → 876.92] So basically.
[876.92 → 877.82] Damaging to the user experience.
[877.86 → 880.56] This is coming back to, is it ad block plus?
[880.62 → 881.52] I can never keep track.
[881.90 → 882.64] This is coming back to.
[882.72 → 883.50] There's so many.
[883.64 → 883.90] Whatever.
[883.90 → 887.90] The concept though of, of a responsible.
[888.36 → 888.72] Yes.
[888.88 → 889.84] Web ad.
[889.94 → 890.08] Yeah.
[890.84 → 895.06] And white listing ads that are non-intrusive.
[895.12 → 895.88] That's the idea then.
[896.02 → 904.06] So their thing is, uh, they're, they're blocking ads that are beneath a threshold of user or consumer acceptability.
[904.06 → 905.16] Mm-hmm.
[905.26 → 907.80] If you go to a website, and it's like, oh my goodness, this is ridiculous.
[907.98 → 908.98] Hopefully they'll be blocking that.
[909.46 → 911.22] So tell me this.
[912.32 → 918.86] What would this mean for the effectiveness then of online advertising?
[918.86 → 922.48] Because there's a reason that obnoxious ads exist.
[922.62 → 926.20] If they didn't work, they wouldn't exist.
[926.54 → 928.36] Nobody would put them on their website.
[929.02 → 932.08] So, and, and I mean, you've got some experience with this.
[932.44 → 932.54] Yeah.
[932.54 → 935.00] The obnoxious ads, how much more do they pay?
[935.20 → 936.10] A lot more.
[936.52 → 938.56] Like, can you give us, I actually don't know.
[938.70 → 943.30] I don't remember the exact numbers because this was a couple of years ago where we had this, like, fight.
[944.38 → 944.74] We did?
[945.10 → 946.22] Well, not you and me.
[946.32 → 946.84] Oh, I see.
[946.88 → 950.28] Because I was going to say, I don't, I don't think I was ever pushing you for, like, obnoxious ads.
[950.30 → 950.62] Okay.
[950.72 → 953.30] To give a little bit of context, we're talking about the forum in particular.
[953.66 → 953.68] Yeah.
[953.68 → 954.68] MinusTechTips.com forum.
[954.68 → 961.36] That's the only place where we've, there was a recent little bit of a kerfuffle where, um, a certain member of the team, Colton,
[961.36 → 967.16] added a bunch of ads and, like, didn't put them in the right spots and didn't enable the right rules.
[967.16 → 976.16] So, like, people that had paid to be on the forum while not seeing ads were seeing ads, and they were, like, everywhere and in really obnoxious places and stuff.
[976.24 → 977.30] But I took care of that.
[977.46 → 978.08] It's fine now.
[978.08 → 984.82] Um, but there, there was a little bit of a kerfuffle way back in the day when we were kind of deciding how we want everything to work.
[984.96 → 998.32] And a partner that we had, uh, that was, like, getting the ads for us to put on the website was a little distraught because they wanted to put ads, um, not just above the fold.
[998.32 → 1000.78] Because we have one ad that's above the fold on the top right.
[1000.78 → 1002.32] I don't think it's too intrusive.
[1002.76 → 1005.46] Um, but they wanted to put it, like, centre, middle, top.
[1005.98 → 1008.84] Here, why don't I log in so you guys can see.
[1009.48 → 1010.60] Okay, so here you go.
[1010.78 → 1011.74] Uh, yeah, I'm actually here.
[1011.76 → 1012.54] I'm just going to move us.
[1013.78 → 1021.18] So, um, this spot right here is what we call above the fold, which is above the first page break on a website.
[1021.18 → 1023.38] You can actually see we don't even have anything on our second.
[1023.94 → 1024.10] No.
[1024.10 → 1025.66] We don't have a lot of advertising on our site.
[1025.66 → 1026.72] Isn't there usually a footer?
[1026.74 → 1027.22] There's supposed to be one down there.
[1027.22 → 1028.56] Okay, there's supposed to be a footer one.
[1028.56 → 1029.16] I'm not sure why it's not there, but they're supposed to be one.
[1029.16 → 1031.54] But, like, why would anyone be here down at the test posts?
[1032.02 → 1032.24] Yeah.
[1032.54 → 1034.46] Not, oh, wait, probably not everyone can see.
[1034.60 → 1035.58] Uh, okay, well, anyway.
[1036.08 → 1041.14] Um, okay, well, right now we're logged into an account that I think has access to stuff that not everybody does.
[1041.32 → 1045.30] But basically, the advertising partner wanted us to put one of those here.
[1045.52 → 1046.64] Or above that.
[1047.10 → 1047.40] What?
[1047.42 → 1048.12] Like, up there.
[1048.18 → 1048.40] Like, here?
[1048.58 → 1048.82] Yeah.
[1049.08 → 1049.44] Ew.
[1049.44 → 1053.06] They wanted it specifically to go in line with the logo up in the top part.
[1053.32 → 1056.28] And they wanted it autoplaying video.
[1056.28 → 1060.38] Audio, um, not necessarily sound because they agreed that was pretty intrusive.
[1060.50 → 1062.86] But, like, autoplaying video, pop-up stuff.
[1063.10 → 1065.04] Like, because those are the things that make money.
[1065.20 → 1068.34] If you make it, like, the top middle of the page, it makes a little bit more money.
[1068.74 → 1072.34] And, like, I think Colton put one right in this area.
[1072.42 → 1072.68] Oops.
[1072.90 → 1073.30] Hold on.
[1073.54 → 1074.02] A bit.
[1074.66 → 1076.42] I think Colton put one right in this area.
[1076.54 → 1076.70] Yeah.
[1077.08 → 1078.52] So I axed that pretty quick.
[1078.52 → 1082.82] There's one where if you go into a forum section.
[1083.18 → 1083.42] Yeah.
[1083.78 → 1084.34] It's the second post.
[1084.34 → 1085.68] If you're not logged in.
[1086.36 → 1087.44] Ooh, this is a long post.
[1087.50 → 1088.26] I am logged in, though.
[1088.52 → 1089.34] If you're, yeah, I know.
[1089.42 → 1092.68] But if you're not logged in, there's one that goes in between these two posts.
[1092.86 → 1093.14] Sure.
[1093.38 → 1095.22] But if you are logged in, it goes away.
[1095.34 → 1098.20] And right now it doesn't have it, but I'll put it there again.
[1098.36 → 1101.34] And back in the day it had this where it shows on each side of that ad.
[1101.98 → 1104.48] It goes just log in to get rid of this ad.
[1104.68 → 1104.90] Right.
[1104.94 → 1106.80] And the idea was we just wanted more members.
[1106.96 → 1107.16] Yeah.
[1107.66 → 1111.26] And if you're just checking out, like, a troubleshooting post, and you're not going to come back, like, sure.
[1111.44 → 1112.86] You can never have enough members.
[1116.24 → 1118.12] That could get ridiculous pretty quick, actually.
[1119.40 → 1119.76] Yeah.
[1119.76 → 1121.02] It would be really painful to, like, move around.
[1121.02 → 1126.38] Well, the member itself is not that painful.
[1126.60 → 1127.28] That's fair.
[1127.32 → 1129.74] As long as each of them doesn't have a ball sack, they do probably okay.
[1132.10 → 1134.26] As Brandon just looks over.
[1136.78 → 1137.68] Sorry, Brandon.
[1138.42 → 1138.94] Okay.
[1139.08 → 1143.02] So, in a nutshell, there's some reasoning behind all this.
[1143.90 → 1150.04] So, Google may choose to block all advertising that appears on sites with offending ads
[1150.04 → 1152.54] instead of the individual offending ads themselves.
[1152.68 → 1162.26] So, Google is, like, taking a stand against crappy advertising because these kinds of ads are what are pushing people to install ad-blocking software.
[1162.26 → 1166.38] And 26% of U.S. users now employ ad-blocking tools.
[1166.70 → 1167.80] On their desktops, anyway.
[1168.22 → 1168.34] Yeah.
[1168.42 → 1170.14] And this is, I mean, this is estimated.
[1170.14 → 1181.76] But if you're Google and your whole business is contextual advertising with the idea behind it being that you are providing an ad that has relevance to the user,
[1182.22 → 1192.06] I can see why you might be leveraging your position as the number one browser to try to reverse that tide
[1192.06 → 1198.38] and try and stop bleeding out the users that you can show advertising to.
[1199.12 → 1205.00] And there's that common quote that I don't know how many people actually go with this,
[1205.28 → 1208.58] but there's a common quote that, like, if the ads weren't so intrusive, I wouldn't run ad-block.
[1208.80 → 1208.98] Yeah.
[1209.10 → 1212.80] I personally think that's kind of BS a lot of the time.
[1212.98 → 1215.04] I'm sure it's true for some people.
[1215.04 → 1219.12] I know one person in particular that has it set to off for all sites,
[1219.36 → 1223.64] but then if there's a site that he can, like, barely view because of it, he'll specifically turn it on for that site.
[1223.64 → 1223.84] Right. Okay.
[1224.20 → 1226.64] And I'm like, okay, that seems a little bit more legit to me.
[1226.84 → 1227.12] Right.
[1227.32 → 1228.32] But, like, whatever.
[1228.50 → 1229.90] I understand the concern.
[1230.24 → 1233.96] It is very annoying when you go to some sites, and it's just everywhere.
[1234.10 → 1234.48] Unusable.
[1234.60 → 1239.62] One that I particularly really hate is when you're on a news-style website
[1239.62 → 1244.44] and they have those news-style ads that are just all bull crap.
[1245.76 → 1247.06] The sponsored stories.
[1247.30 → 1253.72] I never actually click on them, but I often think that it's real at first,
[1253.82 → 1257.86] so I'll go read them, and then I'm like, oh, crap, it's one of those stupid things again.
[1258.82 → 1259.00] Ugh.
[1259.56 → 1259.66] Yeah.
[1259.66 → 1262.42] I just, that's so, it just, it's distracting.
[1262.74 → 1266.24] And it's never going to make me click on it because it's so obviously BS.
[1266.74 → 1271.06] But that's the thing is, like, they wouldn't exist if some people weren't clicking on them.
[1271.06 → 1271.60] Here we go.
[1271.72 → 1272.82] So this is what we're talking about.
[1272.82 → 1279.26] It's like, he doesn't speak with his daughter anymore after the incident.
[1279.46 → 1280.78] And, like, it's obviously Keanu.
[1281.22 → 1281.50] Yeah.
[1281.72 → 1284.68] I don't know who the chick is, but she's probably some well-known person, too.
[1284.82 → 1287.26] It's like, she had idea.
[1287.40 → 1287.60] Wow.
[1287.60 → 1290.22] I think they, this one usually has a no in it.
[1290.26 → 1293.08] I think this is, like, how can you not even copy and paste?
[1294.48 → 1297.56] And, like, it's, it's, it's, there's often lots of skin.
[1297.78 → 1298.70] Like, it's, ugh.
[1299.26 → 1301.22] There's, like, weird medical stuff is always in there.
[1301.26 → 1302.76] Yeah, you can see at least, at least two.
[1303.02 → 1303.12] Yeah.
[1303.12 → 1306.26] This secret will destroy the diabetes industry.
[1306.66 → 1307.60] Try it tonight.
[1308.44 → 1309.72] Watch this simple trick.
[1309.82 → 1310.42] Oh, man.
[1311.32 → 1311.78] It's like.
[1311.78 → 1313.62] I just, I hate these ads.
[1314.68 → 1315.08] Yeah.
[1315.58 → 1316.64] I absolutely hate these ads.
[1317.72 → 1318.52] All right.
[1318.74 → 1319.14] So, yeah.
[1319.20 → 1320.42] I would be very down with that.
[1320.54 → 1321.08] Go ahead, Google.
[1321.60 → 1322.28] Run for it.
[1322.50 → 1323.90] I'll make sure the forum's all good.
[1324.02 → 1329.12] I do wonder if they're going to make the make it through the like, you know, the regulatory
[1329.12 → 1330.14] bodies that exist.
[1330.26 → 1334.16] I don't know who exactly would be, would be sort of monitoring that.
[1334.16 → 1337.80] The thing is, though, I don't think it's a problem because your browser interprets the
[1337.80 → 1337.96] internet.
[1337.96 → 1339.02] It's anti-competitive.
[1339.46 → 1347.22] If Google is blocking other ad providers' ads with their browser that they control, and
[1347.22 → 1351.70] they're an ad provider, and they're not blocking their own ads, I mean, they could say, no,
[1351.78 → 1353.26] we're blocking our own ads equally.
[1353.44 → 1358.18] Ours aren't obnoxious, so they don't fall within these criteria that was determined by this
[1358.18 → 1360.40] third-party coalition for better ads.
[1360.84 → 1361.86] It's not our fault.
[1361.86 → 1364.04] But that's got to hold up in court.
[1364.10 → 1367.86] I mean, I'm sure Google has, like, done, is going to do their due, I mean, it's not like
[1367.86 → 1368.66] this is happening yet.
[1368.74 → 1369.78] It's not like this is even confirmed.
[1370.02 → 1370.70] It's very much a rumour.
[1370.78 → 1377.42] I'm sure they'll do their due diligence before they just roll this out, but I have some serious
[1377.42 → 1381.32] doubts about whether this would make it through the scrutiny of a legal review.
[1381.78 → 1388.04] And given the size of the advertising industry, the kinds of damages that Google could potentially
[1388.04 → 1392.60] have to pay for a move like this could actually be enough to dissuade them.
[1392.60 → 1399.16] Like, yes, they have enough money to buy the earth and all the heavens, but it could be
[1399.16 → 1401.06] significant enough to be an issue.
[1401.40 → 1401.50] Yeah.
[1403.00 → 1404.00] I hope they do it.
[1404.00 → 1407.66] This was originally posted by CELA1.
[1407.66 → 1419.92] So, um, for those of you who were wondering if perhaps AMD did do the retooling and refining
[1419.92 → 1428.56] of the manufacturing on their RX 470 and 480 graphics cards that they said they did in order
[1428.56 → 1437.76] to turn them into 570 and 580 graphics cards, then, um, I don't remember how I started that
[1437.76 → 1439.22] sentence, so I'm not sure how to end it.
[1439.36 → 1441.30] For those of you that actually believed.
[1441.50 → 1441.80] Yes.
[1441.80 → 1451.72] Um, it may be that they didn't do quite as much as they said they did, and the high, uh, power
[1451.72 → 1460.92] consumption of the 570 and the 580 may simply have to do with AMD binning for high leakage,
[1461.38 → 1465.16] high, high power chips, and cranking up the voltage.
[1465.16 → 1470.30] So, it is, uh, it looks like the original article here is from Guru3D.
[1470.80 → 1476.88] There could have even maybe been some retooling to help them get larger bins of cars that they
[1476.88 → 1478.38] think would fit under this.
[1478.38 → 1484.60] Yep, yep, and that's, that's very, very possible, and, nay, probable, as well.
[1484.78 → 1490.78] But what it looks like is that most of the board partners are using the very same PCB design,
[1490.90 → 1497.20] according to Hilbert over there, um, that they used for the 400 series, and since the device ID
[1497.20 → 1505.06] doesn't appear to be changed, just the subsystem ID, then there's the possibility that you can
[1505.06 → 1510.22] flash the graphics card using ATI tool, or, excuse me, ATI flash.
[1511.48 → 1520.54] So, um, looks like it can be achieved regardless of CPU, um, and, uh, yeah, there you go.
[1520.60 → 1523.14] I mean, it's not like this is the first time that, yay, thank you.
[1523.80 → 1524.20] Oh.
[1524.20 → 1528.10] It's not like this is the first time that AMD has run into this sort of thing, which really
[1528.10 → 1531.10] does kind of raise the question, did they, did they not see this coming?
[1531.22 → 1533.00] It's, it's, it wasn't even that long ago.
[1533.18 → 1534.04] Maybe they don't care.
[1535.04 → 1541.56] I think my favourite one was 290 to 290X, because it was, like, literally sold as a different
[1541.56 → 1543.98] product within the same time frame.
[1543.98 → 1547.60] Yeah, they've had other situations, I mean.
[1547.98 → 1548.62] They've had a lot.
[1548.70 → 1554.98] Flashing Radons goes all the way back to, like, the 9500 non-pro, where they reused the
[1554.98 → 1560.90] PCB design and memory layout of the Radeon 9700.
[1561.50 → 1562.08] There you go.
[1562.50 → 1569.52] Um, and if you had, I believe it was the I-shaped memory config versus the lower cost with lower
[1569.52 → 1573.62] clocked L-shaped memory config, then you could flash it to a 9700.
[1573.76 → 1574.16] Is that right?
[1574.62 → 1576.00] You would probably know that, wouldn't you?
[1576.18 → 1579.60] 2.8 nanosecond, 256-bit memory, yes.
[1579.84 → 1583.02] So, so, so, so L was, L was good, or bad?
[1583.04 → 1583.48] L-shaped.
[1583.76 → 1586.84] Sorry, so apparently L was good, I-shaped was bad.
[1587.46 → 1593.96] Um, anyway, which kind of leads me to believe, then, that they must just not care.
[1594.02 → 1597.02] I mean, remember the 59, uh, 5870?
[1597.22 → 1598.30] It might even be good for them.
[1598.30 → 1599.70] It just had a BIOS switch on it.
[1600.06 → 1600.28] Yeah.
[1600.54 → 1604.70] And they were just like, yeah, there's, like, a normal BIOS and, like, a whatever BIOS.
[1606.32 → 1607.68] Do whatever you're going to do with that.
[1607.96 → 1609.92] Like, maybe they just don't give a crap.
[1610.10 → 1614.24] It might legitimately be good for them, because this isn't, it's very unlikely to come across
[1614.24 → 1618.14] as bad news to people that are very informed, because they're just going to be like, oh,
[1618.14 → 1620.74] sweet, I can buy the older one, and then just do this crazy manual thing.
[1621.08 → 1624.34] And those people that aren't informed aren't really going to care, and they'll buy whatever
[1624.34 → 1625.76] one fits into their budget properly.
[1625.76 → 1629.62] So the hardcore will be, like, excited and talking about their brand.
[1630.42 → 1634.08] Maybe this is why AMD ends up with kind of that, um...
[1634.08 → 1634.60] A rebellion.
[1634.76 → 1637.64] That team, that team red kind of fanaticism.
[1637.88 → 1644.80] Where it's like, they just kind of leave stuff there for those super hardcore to find.
[1644.80 → 1646.00] Their company is built on hope.
[1646.12 → 1647.24] Built on Easter eggs.
[1647.58 → 1648.66] Easter eggs and hope.
[1648.66 → 1649.16] I know.
[1650.28 → 1655.06] Where it's just like, realistically, no one else is probably even going to care about
[1655.06 → 1658.84] the small performance difference between a 400 series and a 500 series.
[1660.42 → 1662.54] And, like, the actual risk.
[1662.58 → 1664.16] I think a lot of companies worry about this.
[1664.54 → 1669.48] Where they're like, yeah, I mean, realistically, we don't care if people were to flash the card,
[1669.56 → 1672.46] but what we're worried about is people screwing it up and bricking the card.
[1672.46 → 1680.18] But I think the percentage of users who are actually going to download a tool like ATI Flash
[1680.18 → 1688.20] is so small that all you really stand to gain is hardcore users who are, like, super excited
[1688.20 → 1694.60] about it, doing it, and talking about what a great company you are, and the people who
[1694.60 → 1699.26] don't care just not doing it and just having to listen to their friend.
[1699.26 → 1700.22] Yes, yes, okay.
[1700.88 → 1702.78] Yes, the 480 is cheaper and better.
[1703.06 → 1703.38] You know what?
[1703.48 → 1704.56] I can play my game just fine.
[1704.58 → 1705.76] I can't be bothered with that.
[1705.80 → 1706.84] I'm just going to get a 580.
[1706.92 → 1707.56] I don't care.
[1707.66 → 1708.18] Go away.
[1708.38 → 1708.88] Shut up.
[1709.70 → 1712.22] I'll see you on Discord in 20 minutes.
[1715.42 → 1717.06] So, yeah, there you have it.
[1717.68 → 1717.98] Okay.
[1718.18 → 1723.64] Now let's get into our biggest topic of the day, right after these ads.
[1723.96 → 1724.64] Fresh books.
[1726.58 → 1727.06] Oh.
[1727.40 → 1727.82] Oh.
[1727.82 → 1733.50] Are you a small business owner or a freelancer having trouble keeping track of things like
[1733.50 → 1739.56] expenses and time logged on a given job, invoices that you've sent out to your clients?
[1740.04 → 1742.90] Fresh books is all about making that easy.
[1743.26 → 1748.88] Instead of having your, like, accounting software on your computer at night, and you get home from
[1748.88 → 1752.56] a long day of painting houses or whatever it is, and your arms are legitimately sore.
[1752.56 → 1752.96] I'm serious.
[1753.30 → 1753.70] No, I know.
[1753.92 → 1755.54] I smile because I, yeah.
[1755.54 → 1760.26] You do enough thousands of reps of pretty much anything, and you're going to get a workout.
[1760.78 → 1760.98] Yeah.
[1762.26 → 1764.18] And the climbing the ladders ain't bad either.
[1764.52 → 1766.86] I've said, like, okay, not to do an aside for something.
[1766.86 → 1768.00] Especially if you're going up with a fiver.
[1768.72 → 1769.02] Yeah.
[1769.42 → 1770.78] Which, five gallons.
[1770.86 → 1771.08] Yeah.
[1771.20 → 1771.36] Yeah.
[1771.42 → 1771.76] Five gallon.
[1771.76 → 1773.68] So you're talking about carrying a five gallon bucket of a ladder.
[1773.68 → 1776.98] That even, like, fill it with almost anything and that's going to be annoying.
[1777.32 → 1777.46] Yeah.
[1777.46 → 1778.88] Let alone, like, a dense liquid.
[1779.08 → 1779.34] Yeah.
[1779.34 → 1785.54] But anyway, so the point is Fresh Books lets you take your accounting with you and makes
[1785.54 → 1787.68] it is simple enough that anyone can do it.
[1787.74 → 1790.28] You just take pictures of your invoices and log them.
[1790.66 → 1793.60] You log your hours so you can make sure you're sending out your bills properly.
[1793.74 → 1795.54] You invoice in less than 30 seconds.
[1795.64 → 1797.72] You send a nice professional looking invoice.
[1797.72 → 1800.72] And the client pays on your terms.
[1800.86 → 1802.60] So you can take deposits.
[1803.20 → 1807.26] You can actually have them pay through the platform so you can get paid faster.
[1807.56 → 1807.70] Yep.
[1807.78 → 1809.02] And this is really cool.
[1809.10 → 1815.04] You can see when the client has seen the invoice and put an end to that, oh, did you send it yet?
[1815.04 → 1816.04] Sorry, I didn't get it.
[1816.08 → 1817.84] Hey, you know, I don't have my chequebook on me.
[1817.88 → 1818.18] You know what?
[1818.24 → 1819.42] Forget your chequebook.
[1819.92 → 1820.88] Well, don't forget your chequebook.
[1820.96 → 1823.76] Remember your chequebook and pay me because I know you saw it.
[1823.90 → 1825.60] Or pay with their little module thing.
[1825.68 → 1826.18] Yeah, or that.
[1826.26 → 1827.10] They have a reader as well.
[1827.24 → 1827.34] Yeah.
[1827.34 → 1829.64] So check it out at freshbooks.com slash win.
[1830.00 → 1830.66] Try it out.
[1830.72 → 1832.06] You get a 30-day free trial.
[1832.44 → 1834.22] And now we're getting, yes, yes.
[1834.28 → 1835.48] Now we're getting into the savage.
[1835.86 → 1837.08] Savage jerky.
[1838.16 → 1839.84] Which one was the one that I really like?
[1840.24 → 1841.34] There were a couple, actually.
[1841.34 → 1844.06] So last time I ate the reaper on stream and just, like, died.
[1844.78 → 1847.78] So that was a level five of hot.
[1847.88 → 1850.66] They showed their, like, heat level at the bottom, which I think is super cool.
[1850.76 → 1851.74] This is a level four.
[1851.84 → 1852.50] I've got a two.
[1852.98 → 1854.98] I'm going for the maple buffalo bacon.
[1855.24 → 1855.90] Maple buffalo bacon.
[1855.90 → 1857.88] These guys, actually, this is hilarious.
[1858.24 → 1860.90] So you know how they sponsored us, like, a bazillion years ago?
[1861.06 → 1861.24] Yeah.
[1861.32 → 1863.68] And then they just went, like, radio silence on us?
[1863.74 → 1863.88] Yeah.
[1864.10 → 1866.66] So it turns out that wasn't because they hate us.
[1867.20 → 1870.04] That was just, like, a shipping logistical issue.
[1870.04 → 1873.38] So, yeah, they don't hate us.
[1873.40 → 1873.84] It's all good.
[1874.10 → 1879.68] Which is good because I was like, hey, Colton, did we get any more samples of that jerky?
[1880.10 → 1880.54] And he's like...
[1880.54 → 1882.14] We ate everything they sent us so fast.
[1882.22 → 1882.60] I know.
[1883.60 → 1885.64] So maple buffalo bacon.
[1886.22 → 1887.20] Wait, is that a five?
[1887.72 → 1888.34] This is a four.
[1888.64 → 1888.92] Okay.
[1889.46 → 1890.42] We have a five.
[1890.94 → 1891.34] I know.
[1891.44 → 1892.72] We have the Carolina reaper.
[1892.92 → 1894.36] That's what I ate last time and I, like, died.
[1894.48 → 1895.86] And we also have the ghost pepper.
[1896.16 → 1897.18] Did you try ghost pepper yet?
[1897.40 → 1897.94] Oh my god.
[1898.02 → 1898.14] I don't know.
[1898.14 → 1898.28] Okay.
[1898.34 → 1899.76] I want to try the mojo habanero.
[1899.92 → 1900.16] Okay.
[1900.24 → 1901.18] Let's see how you deal with that.
[1901.32 → 1901.54] Okay.
[1902.18 → 1903.06] Are you good with spicy stuff?
[1903.14 → 1905.54] I just really like the maple one, so I'm eating that first.
[1906.06 → 1906.36] Okay.
[1906.56 → 1907.86] Have you tried the maple buffalo bacon?
[1908.08 → 1908.56] I have not.
[1909.26 → 1909.74] It's perfect.
[1909.76 → 1910.36] It's not that hot.
[1910.62 → 1910.82] Mmm.
[1911.58 → 1914.90] You might not get the full effect if you've already eaten a really spicy one recently.
[1915.06 → 1915.58] I can clear it up.
[1915.80 → 1915.96] Yeah.
[1916.02 → 1916.82] You have to...
[1917.96 → 1918.44] Solent?
[1918.54 → 1918.72] Really?
[1919.00 → 1920.76] It's, like, the same consistency as milk.
[1920.86 → 1921.28] It works.
[1922.76 → 1924.38] You disgust me in every way.
[1927.94 → 1929.10] What's wrong with you?
[1929.92 → 1930.32] Everything.
[1930.70 → 1931.82] I'm just gonna wash down...
[1932.60 → 1934.82] This jerky bacon...
[1936.82 → 1938.14] With some Solent.
[1938.14 → 1941.70] Everything is wrong with that sentence.
[1942.56 → 1942.96] Okay.
[1943.76 → 1945.04] So the mojo habanero.
[1945.44 → 1945.88] This is...
[1945.88 → 1946.10] Oh, no.
[1946.14 → 1946.58] This is three.
[1947.58 → 1947.90] Three.
[1947.98 → 1948.16] Wait.
[1948.62 → 1948.84] Oh, no.
[1948.90 → 1949.08] It goes to four.
[1949.08 → 1950.14] Oh, it's a four-point scale.
[1950.34 → 1951.00] Four-point scale.
[1951.18 → 1951.48] Okay.
[1952.32 → 1952.86] So, yeah.
[1952.96 → 1954.46] The two is, like...
[1954.46 → 1954.84] Oh, no.
[1954.96 → 1955.10] No.
[1955.18 → 1957.38] The Reaper is five.
[1957.66 → 1959.26] That does go all the way to five.
[1959.50 → 1960.46] It adds another bar.
[1960.46 → 1963.08] It adds another bar over the rest of the packages.
[1963.38 → 1963.76] Okay.
[1963.86 → 1965.00] So the ghost pepper is a four.
[1965.70 → 1966.08] Okay.
[1966.18 → 1966.40] Okay.
[1966.48 → 1968.10] So see if you can handle the ghost pepper, then.
[1968.14 → 1968.40] Okay.
[1969.64 → 1970.82] So is this one...
[1970.82 → 1972.00] This one's a three.
[1972.08 → 1976.62] This can't be that bad, because the maple buffalo bacon is a two, and that's really not that hot.
[1976.66 → 1978.58] I don't taste, like, any heat from the maple buffalo.
[1978.58 → 1983.70] This stuff is, like, so covered in, like, spices and, like...
[1984.58 → 1985.04] All right.
[1985.12 → 1985.52] Habanero.
[1985.52 → 1986.52] It's spicy.
[1986.52 → 1988.64] It's spicy.
[1989.32 → 1990.26] It's not too bad.
[1991.32 → 1992.00] But it's spicy.
[1992.06 → 1993.28] No, it's spicy, but it's nice.
[1993.50 → 1993.68] Yeah.
[1994.00 → 1996.00] Beef, lime juice, water...
[1997.00 → 1998.30] Oh, there's a little bit of kick.
[1998.60 → 1998.82] Oh!
[1998.82 → 1999.82] It takes a sec.
[1999.82 → 1999.84] It takes a sec.
[2003.68 → 2004.98] You can taste the citrus, though.
[2005.02 → 2007.22] It has lime juice, orange juice, and lemon juice.
[2008.94 → 2009.30] Whew!
[2009.50 → 2010.28] How's it going?
[2010.74 → 2011.54] That's nice, though.
[2012.18 → 2013.22] It's perfect.
[2013.26 → 2014.08] It tastes perfect.
[2014.08 → 2014.38] Yeah.
[2014.82 → 2016.64] Cayenne pepper, habanero pepper...
[2016.64 → 2019.54] And one nice thing about spicy jerky is you'll eat it a little bit slower.
[2019.98 → 2020.34] Yeah.
[2020.70 → 2021.30] Otherwise, it's...
[2021.30 → 2022.66] You can, like, enjoy the package a little bit longer.
[2022.66 → 2025.74] It's easy to, like, destroy an entire bag of jerky.
[2025.94 → 2026.10] Yeah.
[2026.66 → 2026.98] Okay.
[2030.10 → 2031.82] Well, what'd you think of the maple one?
[2032.22 → 2034.80] I liked it, but I like the beef ones more, personally.
[2034.90 → 2035.94] Well, I'll just keep this, then.
[2036.20 → 2036.40] Yeah.
[2036.40 → 2042.86] I love being the host, because, like, Colton's been keeping everyone else away from this stuff
[2042.86 → 2047.92] with a stick for the last week, and he's been saving it, basically, for us to sit on stream
[2047.92 → 2048.38] and eat it.
[2049.02 → 2049.60] Is that good?
[2049.78 → 2050.24] That's good.
[2052.40 → 2053.28] Pretty spicy, though?
[2053.30 → 2053.48] Yeah.
[2056.92 → 2057.24] Oh.
[2058.62 → 2059.02] Oh.
[2059.14 → 2061.06] I don't think I'm completely dying, like, with the Reaper.
[2061.88 → 2065.88] I never tried the cracked pepper and sea salt one, so I'm gonna just eat wussy ones for
[2065.88 → 2066.58] the rest of the show.
[2067.20 → 2068.42] But there you have it, guys.
[2068.98 → 2069.72] Savage jerky.
[2070.86 → 2072.26] Oh, I swallowed a little wrong there.
[2072.86 → 2073.94] Eh, inhaled a little wrong.
[2075.16 → 2077.80] Trust me, you don't want hot jerky down your windpipe.
[2078.12 → 2078.82] That's bad.
[2079.88 → 2081.78] Anyway, savagejerky.com.
[2081.86 → 2083.86] Use offer code LTT to save 10%.
[2083.86 → 2087.88] Lots of different flavours, and it's good stuff, man.
[2087.88 → 2094.20] So this one, the ghost pepper one, is, like, a good top-of-my-tolerance-level spice, I think.
[2094.28 → 2094.44] Yeah.
[2094.84 → 2095.68] Like, I had one.
[2095.94 → 2097.42] I'm good for a while.
[2099.22 → 2099.98] I'm okay.
[2100.16 → 2101.04] I'm processing it.
[2101.04 → 2101.74] Everything's fine.
[2102.52 → 2103.16] Until...
[2103.16 → 2103.84] The Reaper is...
[2103.84 → 2104.06] Tomorrow.
[2104.06 → 2104.84] ...is too much.
[2105.30 → 2106.74] I'm actually usually pretty good with that.
[2106.86 → 2107.08] Yeah?
[2107.30 → 2107.56] Yeah.
[2108.04 → 2109.14] I've never had that problem.
[2109.22 → 2113.54] That's far more detail about your bodily functions than I ever cared to know, but I guess I kind
[2113.54 → 2114.36] of invite it, don't I?
[2114.36 → 2115.32] We've shared it with everyone.
[2115.54 → 2115.74] Yeah.
[2115.74 → 2117.26] On stream.
[2117.26 → 2118.26] That's, uh...
[2118.26 → 2120.20] That's the way we do it.
[2120.58 → 2121.56] Live and archived.
[2121.76 → 2122.30] All right.
[2122.52 → 2124.04] So, Valve.
[2125.24 → 2125.84] Yes.
[2125.84 → 2127.40] This is a huge move.
[2127.48 → 2129.70] Originally posted on Ars Technica.
[2129.82 → 2130.66] Let's go ahead and get that.
[2130.72 → 2132.94] I'm pretty sure this has already happened with CSGO.
[2134.24 → 2135.52] Just to add to that.
[2135.52 → 2141.24] So, Valve asks for phone numbers to confirm Data 2 player identities.
[2142.58 → 2148.92] And the idea is that this move would cut down on expert players intentionally surfing
[2148.92 → 2149.20] noobs.
[2149.26 → 2152.70] And if you're not familiar with the term surfing, then get off Twitch!
[2153.42 → 2154.70] Because you suck!
[2155.26 → 2155.84] And cheating.
[2155.84 → 2160.14] Actually, I'm kidding because I know a lot of people are here for our tech show and not
[2160.14 → 2161.46] necessarily regular Twitch viewers.
[2161.98 → 2170.06] So, surfing refers to creating a separate dummy profile that is a very low level so you
[2170.06 → 2177.94] can just, like, kind of sit with your jackass friends and be like, this guy doesn't know
[2177.94 → 2181.42] how to play this game as well as me because I've logged, like, 800 hours.
[2181.94 → 2183.32] So, like, I'm on a new account.
[2183.42 → 2184.28] Now I'm on a new account.
[2184.28 → 2185.66] I'm just going to, like, kick his ass.
[2185.74 → 2186.44] It's just so great.
[2186.76 → 2190.14] So, I think the ghost pepper one, sorry to go back, hits you a little bit later.
[2190.72 → 2190.92] Yeah?
[2192.28 → 2196.38] Oh, my salivary glands are, like, firing.
[2197.46 → 2198.90] Trying to, like, cool everything down.
[2198.96 → 2199.36] Nice.
[2199.80 → 2200.70] It's, uh, yeah.
[2200.86 → 2201.34] I don't know.
[2201.66 → 2208.06] These are maybe, like, for me at least, like, one strip every, like, while.
[2208.10 → 2208.40] While.
[2208.54 → 2208.82] Got it.
[2208.92 → 2210.74] Thankfully, they are resealable packages.
[2211.08 → 2211.74] Uh, anyway.
[2211.74 → 2213.08] Yeah.
[2213.20 → 2215.44] So, the idea is you have to have an attached phone number.
[2215.52 → 2217.52] This should cut down on Smurfs like you were just talking about.
[2217.52 → 2217.68] Mm-hmm.
[2217.68 → 2218.96] But also cheaters.
[2219.58 → 2224.50] Because if your phone number is used, and then you are banned, I believe you cannot reuse
[2224.50 → 2226.14] that phone number for three months?
[2228.02 → 2228.76] Three months.
[2228.76 → 2228.98] Oh.
[2229.72 → 2233.90] So, phone numbers can't be passed between accounts without a three-month waiting period.
[2233.98 → 2234.18] Yeah.
[2234.48 → 2236.36] So, it should reduce cheaters as well.
[2236.42 → 2242.56] So, if you can queue up with only people that have verified numbers, that means you'll
[2242.56 → 2248.20] have fewer cheaters and fewer Smurfs, which makes a way better competitive experience.
[2248.60 → 2250.94] I'm, like, fairly certain this is already in Counter-Strike.
[2251.02 → 2252.46] I guess I should have just checked the chat.
[2252.46 → 2254.36] So, Valve's statement here.
[2254.80 → 2260.52] Players using multiple accounts create a negative matchmaking experience at all skill brackets.
[2261.02 → 2266.30] So, our goal is to add just enough friction to this process that the number of players
[2266.30 → 2268.04] doing this will be noticeably reduced.
[2268.88 → 2273.46] Having more players using their primary accounts will have a positive effect on both ranked and
[2273.46 → 2275.08] unranked matchmaking.
[2275.20 → 2275.34] Yeah.
[2275.40 → 2276.76] So, it's already called CSGO Prime.
[2276.76 → 2280.40] You have a Prime enabled account if you've attached your phone number.
[2280.68 → 2284.08] And that has made a significant positive improvement in the CSGO community.
[2284.40 → 2285.76] So, they're spreading it over to Data 2.
[2286.00 → 2287.80] You had an interesting mention.
[2287.92 → 2292.70] I haven't actually heard anyone bring up the fact that it reduces anonymity in gaming.
[2292.80 → 2293.18] It does.
[2293.22 → 2293.96] Until you said that.
[2294.02 → 2294.82] But that is true.
[2295.30 → 2302.24] And that's something that a lot of people are really, feel very strongly should be preserved.
[2302.24 → 2307.12] But that's a viewpoint that I've personally argued against in the past.
[2307.26 → 2308.34] I mean, as...
[2308.34 → 2309.06] But, okay.
[2309.22 → 2310.24] And all of this comes...
[2310.24 → 2310.88] You have to understand.
[2310.98 → 2312.78] Take it with a dump truck worth of salt.
[2313.44 → 2322.86] Because this comes from my perspective as someone who has willingly forfeited basically
[2322.86 → 2328.96] all of my online privacy by being a web video personality.
[2328.96 → 2338.54] So, I look at it and I go, well, for me, the ways in which I could behave like a complete
[2338.54 → 2342.44] as shat online are pretty limited.
[2342.70 → 2346.56] Because if anyone figured out it was me, I actually...
[2346.56 → 2348.58] There are people out there who know who I am.
[2348.64 → 2350.86] I have a reputation to uphold.
[2351.12 → 2353.94] Anonymity means you don't have a reputation to uphold.
[2354.30 → 2357.78] You could be the nicest person one day and the crappiest person the other day and there's
[2357.78 → 2358.98] basically no consequences.
[2361.12 → 2363.16] And there are arguments to be made the other way.
[2363.72 → 2368.36] Like anonymity lets you, you know, truly speak your mind in a way that you couldn't.
[2368.84 → 2372.74] But there are a lot of people, particularly in the gaming community, that quite frankly,
[2372.80 → 2374.24] I don't think should be allowed to speak their mind.
[2375.04 → 2376.10] I'm letting him go.
[2376.18 → 2376.72] I disagree.
[2377.02 → 2378.06] I'm just saying.
[2378.22 → 2379.82] But I'm letting him go to get his point across.
[2379.82 → 2388.76] So, basically, I think that anonymity is the same as not having any accountability.
[2389.80 → 2397.26] And for myself, I've personally made the choice to forfeit my anonymity and would love to
[2397.26 → 2402.88] be able to reap the benefit of interacting with other people online who have willingly
[2402.88 → 2404.18] forfeited their anonymity.
[2404.40 → 2406.34] So, that's what I like about this move from Valve.
[2406.34 → 2408.34] They're not forcing everybody to do it.
[2408.56 → 2408.60] Yeah.
[2408.70 → 2415.14] They're just saying if you willingly give up that anonymity, and you are willing to tie
[2415.14 → 2421.66] your personal actual you to an actual avatar in a one-to-one relationship, then you get
[2421.66 → 2425.80] the benefit of interacting only with other people who are also willing to do the same.
[2425.86 → 2427.06] And I think that's a great move.
[2427.30 → 2433.30] I'm cool with that concept at this level where the anonymity loss is not public.
[2433.30 → 2435.30] But just to the...
[2436.78 → 2437.74] Let's say it wasn't Valve.
[2438.46 → 2442.20] See, that's where some of it loses me, too, because I don't want to give my phone number
[2442.20 → 2442.92] to just anybody.
[2444.40 → 2446.12] That becomes an issue.
[2446.20 → 2450.80] Even with Valve and these big companies, what they do with data is so sketchy.
[2450.88 → 2454.16] We have a topic in here that we'll probably talk about later where Bose has apparently
[2454.16 → 2459.20] been stealing people's data in terms of what music and podcasts and stuff they've been
[2459.20 → 2462.78] listening to on their wireless headphones, which is like, what the hell, guys?
[2462.98 → 2468.04] And apparently they have very definitely been selling it, which is just so Garbo.
[2468.12 → 2469.08] But we'll talk about that later.
[2469.78 → 2470.30] Unreal, eh?
[2470.82 → 2474.36] So I do not like giving forward my information.
[2474.78 → 2481.22] But at the same time, if it's something fairly minimal, I don't really use my actual calling
[2481.22 → 2482.46] feature on my phone much anymore.
[2482.46 → 2486.88] And if someone calls me, and it's not a number that's already in my phone, I pretty much don't
[2486.88 → 2487.30] pick up.
[2487.68 → 2487.78] Right.
[2488.18 → 2492.28] And like phone services and stuff now auto-detect certain numbers.
[2492.78 → 2495.80] So like if my ISP calls me, it will tell me their company name.
[2496.24 → 2496.40] Yeah.
[2496.42 → 2497.22] So they show up.
[2497.28 → 2499.98] If it's a super random number, I just don't pick it up.
[2500.02 → 2501.74] So I'm not that worried about that leaking.
[2504.26 → 2506.64] I personally think this is a cool system.
[2506.64 → 2512.08] When CSGO Prime came out, I jumped on that as soon as I could, because I thought that
[2512.08 → 2512.52] was cool.
[2512.68 → 2516.76] I don't like losing my anonymity outwards to people that are playing the game.
[2516.94 → 2517.22] Sure.
[2517.56 → 2518.54] I hate that concept.
[2518.70 → 2522.96] I hated so much when YouTube was supposed to be like real names.
[2523.20 → 2523.60] Right.
[2523.74 → 2525.20] That was stupid.
[2525.68 → 2526.72] I hated that.
[2526.80 → 2527.86] That was a dumb idea.
[2529.04 → 2530.76] And I think the internet agreed with me.
[2530.76 → 2537.32] But losing a little bit just so that you can get rid of all the like just terrible people,
[2537.46 → 2540.66] not all of them, but a lot of the terrible people is pretty cool.
[2542.86 → 2548.82] Especially when like, could you attach, I wonder if you could attach like a Skype number.
[2549.86 → 2550.76] That I don't know.
[2550.98 → 2552.60] Or something that isn't like your real phone.
[2552.90 → 2553.12] Yeah.
[2553.12 → 2554.72] That's something I haven't really tried.
[2554.72 → 2560.80] I mean, obviously there's the whole other issue of like, basically like burner numbers
[2560.80 → 2563.46] being very, very inexpensive.
[2563.80 → 2564.06] Yes.
[2564.94 → 2567.08] But you'd have to go out and do something.
[2567.28 → 2568.78] That's good enough for me, in my opinion.
[2568.84 → 2569.00] Yep.
[2569.22 → 2570.44] And it reduces the convenience.
[2571.02 → 2571.18] Yeah.
[2571.68 → 2576.32] If you reduce the convenience, because like I would rather go out and get a burner number
[2576.32 → 2578.40] or go get a Skype number or something.
[2578.50 → 2579.18] I don't know if that works.
[2579.26 → 2580.12] I don't even know if that's possible.
[2580.12 → 2586.54] But go do something that takes a couple steps so that it would increase the barrier of like,
[2586.88 → 2591.84] oh, in 20 seconds, I can just be trolling a bunch of people and just be a giant jerk.
[2592.16 → 2592.72] Well, okay.
[2593.22 → 2596.18] Now maybe you have to go to the store and buy a pay-as-you-go phone or something.
[2596.42 → 2596.48] Yeah.
[2596.54 → 2598.10] Like that takes more steps.
[2598.16 → 2601.22] You have to actually like to leave your house and go deliberately do something.
[2601.54 → 2603.34] The amount of people that will actually do that is pretty low.
[2603.44 → 2604.92] And that I would be very happy to live with.
[2605.42 → 2607.32] ComicSaber asks why no S8 review?
[2607.44 → 2607.98] Oh, it's coming.
[2608.44 → 2609.46] I filmed it today.
[2610.12 → 2614.50] Um, yeah, basically we didn't get one early.
[2614.64 → 2615.26] So there's that.
[2618.06 → 2618.70] All right.
[2618.72 → 2621.22] Did we make fun of the note too much or like?
[2621.82 → 2622.54] No, actually.
[2622.80 → 2626.88] Well, I just, I had so much to say about it that it was already going to be like an 11
[2626.88 → 2630.00] minute video without pre-roll and integration.
[2630.28 → 2632.18] No, I mean like the reason why we didn't get it early.
[2632.50 → 2633.52] Oh, no.
[2633.52 → 2639.34] No, we've just, our Samsung contacts, it's a complicated thing.
[2639.34 → 2643.04] We're probably getting too far into like the boring business of being a YouTuber right
[2643.04 → 2643.28] now.
[2643.36 → 2646.20] But basically we are physically located in Canada.
[2646.20 → 2646.72] Oh.
[2646.98 → 2649.60] But the majority of our audience is in the U.S.
[2649.60 → 2661.96] So, so for a lot of big companies, the U.S. division can't talk to us because we are on Canadian
[2661.96 → 2662.40] soil.
[2662.90 → 2669.00] And the Canadian division only wants to talk about stupid Canadian things.
[2669.00 → 2670.04] I feel like we should like.
[2670.30 → 2672.86] Like when this phone is launching on Bell.
[2673.12 → 2675.70] I don't care when it's launching on Bell.
[2675.98 → 2677.92] I want to know when the hardware is available.
[2678.24 → 2684.76] So I'll get these stupid press releases like, you know, three weeks from now that are like,
[2685.64 → 2689.58] oh, can you believe this phone's coming to Rogers and tell us.
[2689.64 → 2692.16] And I'm like, review units available.
[2692.50 → 2694.56] What am I supposed to say about it at this point?
[2694.56 → 2695.66] Thanks for nothing.
[2696.82 → 2697.04] So.
[2697.04 → 2699.34] I feel like we should just like incorporate in Delaware.
[2699.60 → 2699.90] Oh.
[2700.14 → 2707.26] And get like a get like a 100 square foot one-bedroom apartment in like nowhere land.
[2709.02 → 2710.68] What is, what is this?
[2710.68 → 2712.34] Oh, I thought it was something.
[2712.64 → 2714.70] I thought you were going to like to get the hammer and attack me or something.
[2714.76 → 2715.10] No.
[2715.10 → 2718.06] I was like, I mean, this is exciting.
[2719.42 → 2720.46] What does that, what does that mean?
[2722.12 → 2724.80] Paint me scared but excited or something like that.
[2724.86 → 2725.78] I don't remember what it is, but whatever.
[2727.24 → 2731.36] But yeah, like I, I almost, it's a pretty big issue being in Canada.
[2731.58 → 2731.80] Yeah.
[2732.62 → 2737.28] Companies, even when I like to tell them we're in Canada, and they're like, oh yeah, we can
[2737.28 → 2738.98] have our like Canadian contact reach out to you.
[2739.00 → 2743.08] I'm like, please, no, please don't do that.
[2743.08 → 2744.40] And they're like, oh no, it's fine.
[2744.46 → 2746.04] I'm like, it is not fine.
[2746.54 → 2748.22] It is not fine at all.
[2748.88 → 2750.52] Nothing about this is fine.
[2751.10 → 2751.40] Yeah.
[2753.20 → 2757.66] Speaking of things that are fine, we've got some fine videos up on Flow plane Club right
[2757.66 → 2757.98] now.
[2759.22 → 2759.70] Yeah.
[2759.82 → 2763.22] So you guys have been hard at work on some pretty crazy stuff.
[2763.28 → 2766.20] Is there anything that's not totally behind the scenes that we can talk about?
[2766.96 → 2768.58] I mean, there's the call for coders.
[2768.66 → 2771.80] There's the fact that we've basically revealed what the platform is.
[2771.80 → 2776.48] I was just going to say, I guess I can address some of the comments on this.
[2776.74 → 2777.92] Yeah, that would be a cool time to do it.
[2777.92 → 2783.26] If people have questions in Twitch chat and I see them through the blur of Twitch chat,
[2783.32 → 2784.36] I will try to respond to them.
[2784.70 → 2791.68] A lot of comments on mainly the YouTube side, not this side, were just very odd.
[2791.72 → 2792.64] Our camera's gone, by the way.
[2793.20 → 2795.02] Were just very, very odd.
[2795.24 → 2799.64] Like people, people being like, oh yeah, building a different version of YouTube is a terrible
[2799.64 → 2800.04] idea.
[2800.24 → 2801.82] And I'm like, yes it is.
[2801.90 → 2802.84] Yeah, that would be a terrible idea.
[2802.86 → 2804.04] That's not what we're doing.
[2804.40 → 2805.94] Did you watch the video?
[2806.10 → 2808.56] I would invest exactly zero dollars in that idea.
[2808.66 → 2810.12] Yeah, that's horrible.
[2811.06 → 2815.62] People that think I'm like asking for a lot, I am definitely asking for a lot.
[2815.82 → 2819.16] But they're like, oh my God, one person can't build this platform on their own.
[2819.16 → 2823.24] Like, I know, that's why I included this section about how they're going to have to collaborate
[2823.24 → 2825.52] with all the other people that are working on the project.
[2827.48 → 2827.80] Woo!
[2829.00 → 2830.86] So many misinformed moments.
[2830.86 → 2833.92] Wow, this is about to turn into a rant, isn't it?
[2834.38 → 2834.72] Uh oh.
[2834.82 → 2835.26] A little bit.
[2835.34 → 2835.92] I'm holding back.
[2836.08 → 2837.36] I'm looking for questions in the chat.
[2837.48 → 2840.18] All right, I'll talk about some of the videos that we have coming up.
[2840.26 → 2842.54] So we've got the tiny laptop tested.
[2843.52 → 2845.62] Someone's asking if I did hair implants lately.
[2845.62 → 2846.02] No.
[2846.22 → 2852.74] We did a bunch of really cool testing on that super tiny GPD Pocket laptop, including
[2852.74 → 2857.10] running games on it itself, using Game Stream.
[2857.32 → 2860.24] It's got a great, really sharp 1080p IPS display.
[2860.36 → 2861.34] Really cool little device.
[2861.86 → 2863.30] So we've got our video up for that.
[2863.64 → 2867.06] We've got the first build guide in over a year.
[2867.78 → 2871.90] The $1,000 gaming build guide with Pyrotechnics.
[2872.04 → 2873.52] That is real fire.
[2873.52 → 2876.12] You haven't seen this, have you?
[2876.50 → 2876.88] No.
[2877.84 → 2879.70] That is most...
[2879.70 → 2880.64] Is that when you just...
[2880.64 → 2881.82] No.
[2881.82 → 2883.42] I think I gave you the can for that.
[2883.76 → 2886.18] No, it's definitely more complicated than that.
[2886.18 → 2887.86] Are you stealing my signature move of including...
[2887.86 → 2888.24] What?
[2890.04 → 2890.36] No.
[2890.62 → 2892.98] No, the computer is on fire in this video.
[2893.12 → 2893.80] Don't worry about it.
[2893.80 → 2894.78] Okay, so there's something.
[2894.94 → 2896.30] Maybe get Alex to work on this.
[2896.38 → 2898.62] I've wanted to do this since Scrapy War Wars 4.
[2898.62 → 2905.36] I wanted to work with Rod on this, but it isn't really working out.
[2905.92 → 2907.70] I want to look into fire cooling.
[2908.18 → 2909.00] Fire cooling.
[2909.92 → 2913.36] Using fire to pull the air through the chassis.
[2913.98 → 2914.28] Okay.
[2914.82 → 2915.52] I think it could be done.
[2915.66 → 2918.12] Because fire would consume air, so you use it to pull through.
[2918.30 → 2918.46] Yeah.
[2918.54 → 2919.80] So get some big heat sinks.
[2919.96 → 2920.16] Yeah.
[2920.32 → 2920.62] Okay.
[2920.98 → 2922.04] Get a fire going.
[2922.58 → 2922.92] Okay.
[2923.20 → 2923.80] Fire cooling.
[2923.94 → 2924.40] I like it.
[2924.54 → 2924.82] Yeah.
[2925.04 → 2925.60] I like it.
[2925.60 → 2927.04] Cool something with heat.
[2927.04 → 2930.90] So other things that we have on there right now.
[2930.98 → 2933.24] We have the worst CPU cooler ever.
[2934.50 → 2936.14] Sketchy Heat Sinks Episode 2.
[2937.40 → 2937.96] Oh, man.
[2938.22 → 2939.72] That thing really is abominable.
[2940.58 → 2942.22] Float plane be open to other creators.
[2942.52 → 2944.24] Underwater microphone for GoPro.
[2945.36 → 2945.80] Wow.
[2945.92 → 2946.76] That's an amazing picture.
[2946.90 → 2947.50] Not for a while.
[2947.58 → 2947.76] Yeah.
[2948.10 → 2949.22] Not Photoshopped.
[2949.34 → 2949.76] Very real.
[2949.90 → 2950.00] Okay.
[2950.06 → 2952.06] The dolphins are Photoshopped.
[2952.06 → 2952.86] Where did you do that?
[2952.86 → 2954.70] We have the RGB RAM Roundup.
[2955.14 → 2955.76] Neighbour's pool.
[2955.76 → 2959.00] And I think now we're caught up to what's up on YouTube.
[2959.30 → 2960.76] RGB RAM Roundup.
[2960.88 → 2961.10] Yep.
[2961.96 → 2963.80] It definitely is 2017.
[2964.48 → 2965.10] Yeah, dog.
[2966.78 → 2967.38] All right.
[2967.48 → 2970.52] So why don't you address some of the questions that people have about...
[2970.52 → 2974.72] Honestly, a lot of it's going really fast, and I haven't really actually seen a ton of them.
[2974.92 → 2975.14] Oh.
[2975.26 → 2975.50] Okay.
[2975.50 → 2978.12] How is Float plane supposed to be different?
[2978.64 → 2979.86] The video confused me.
[2979.86 → 2990.72] So if you remember Vessel back in the day, there was an idea where a video would show up on Vessel one week before it showed up on YouTube.
[2991.54 → 2995.66] And there were exceptions to this, like WAN Show or anything that was extremely timely.
[2996.04 → 3000.22] If a new product just came out, it would show up on both platforms at the same time, etc., etc., etc.
[3000.22 → 3007.20] Float plane is going to accomplish that and hopefully much more.
[3007.48 → 3008.62] It should have different tiers.
[3008.96 → 3010.52] The quality should be better.
[3011.88 → 3017.06] It will hopefully soon have its own platform, which we are very actively working on.
[3017.58 → 3018.62] Like its own website.
[3018.88 → 3019.04] Yeah.
[3019.04 → 3022.28] Not just a sub-forum on linustechtips.com.
[3022.64 → 3023.04] Which is like...
[3024.42 → 3024.94] Bank AF.
[3024.94 → 3027.08] The implementation works, but it is pretty Jacky.
[3027.18 → 3027.32] Yeah.
[3028.12 → 3039.14] And so, yeah, it will have other tiers that people can subscribe at, which will have other things that having our own kind of CDN thing set up will enable us to give to the people that are contributing.
[3039.14 → 3063.12] The biggest difference, I think, in terms of what we think will make it a success business-wise is that instead of being a burden on the creator, instead of being a contract that a creator signs and commits to a one-week early access window that they are contractually obligated to uphold that could potentially hurt their ability to get the best discoverability on YouTube.
[3063.52 → 3064.56] And that's the strength of YouTube.
[3064.82 → 3065.54] Discoverability.
[3065.76 → 3066.80] And reach a broader audience.
[3067.00 → 3068.48] We're not looking to damage that.
[3068.48 → 3076.70] So, for us, the way that creators would use Float plane Club would be up to them.
[3077.08 → 3077.18] Yeah.
[3077.28 → 3083.52] So, if they wanted to go like a more rooster-teeth type route and say, okay, we want a four-hour early access window.
[3083.76 → 3084.06] Sure.
[3084.26 → 3086.68] Then we'd kind of go, okay, then go ahead and do that.
[3086.82 → 3092.90] You know, whatever your subscribers are down for, we think is totally cool.
[3093.16 → 3097.84] We just want to build the platform for them and allow them to use it as they will.
[3097.84 → 3104.44] And part of the like, mentality behind it the whole time has been not trying to force people to stay there.
[3105.06 → 3106.84] So, we're going to try to have a very transparent...
[3107.40 → 3107.84] We've always...
[3108.40 → 3108.84] I think...
[3108.84 → 3110.32] I like to think.
[3110.38 → 3112.32] We've always been really transparent at Linus Media Group.
[3112.42 → 3117.64] We literally have a series called Honest Answers where we explain, like, all the weird questions.
[3117.64 → 3118.64] How do we make money?
[3119.06 → 3119.22] Yeah.
[3119.22 → 3120.30] How do you get review samples?
[3120.44 → 3121.62] Like, things people really want to know.
[3121.78 → 3125.74] And we want to be transparent not only to users with Float plane Club, but also to creators.
[3126.54 → 3131.46] We're not going to have weird shadow algorithm changes that, like, screw with everybody.
[3131.46 → 3134.26] We're going to be very open about how we use people's data.
[3134.46 → 3137.46] We're not going to sell people's data, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[3137.66 → 3138.00] So, yeah.
[3138.04 → 3140.34] The idea is pretty simple.
[3140.76 → 3141.56] We...
[3141.56 → 3143.32] Vessel shut down on us pretty much overnight.
[3143.98 → 3144.96] And we went, wow.
[3145.44 → 3154.80] Thank goodness we are smart and talented enough, mostly what's sitting in that chair, to replace this functionality for ourselves.
[3154.80 → 3162.18] What about other people who were successful with a tool like Vessel, and who would want something like that in the future?
[3162.32 → 3162.88] Or were interested.
[3162.98 → 3163.70] What are they going to use?
[3163.80 → 3164.96] Or who were just interested?
[3165.66 → 3166.38] What about...
[3166.38 → 3174.96] Why is it that you have to be a giant sort of mega publisher, like College Humour or Escapist Magazine or Rooster Teeth,
[3174.96 → 3184.20] that can afford to develop your own platform in order to move viewers off platform, where the creator can make a lot more per view?
[3184.80 → 3188.36] And deliver additional benefits to the viewer.
[3188.82 → 3191.50] Why do you have to be a mega publisher in order to achieve that?
[3191.54 → 3192.74] And we don't think you should have to be.
[3192.90 → 3194.06] So, that's the idea.
[3194.46 → 3199.10] We're building something that we were going to build anyway for ourselves because we have that capability now.
[3199.24 → 3203.90] And then we're taking it eight steps further to make it accessible to other people.
[3204.26 → 3204.38] Yeah.
[3204.48 → 3205.70] That's Float plane Club.
[3206.00 → 3208.82] So, people can use it, like he was talking earlier, however they want.
[3209.00 → 3210.26] They can set up whatever tiers they want.
[3210.34 → 3214.18] Maybe they have a 14-year exclusivity window.
[3214.18 → 3218.44] So, that would be a pretty bad way to use the platform, I think, personally.
[3218.44 → 3218.46] Yeah, I think it was stupid.
[3219.00 → 3220.86] But they can do that if they want.
[3220.96 → 3222.18] We like our one-week model.
[3222.30 → 3225.70] It works for us in terms of like a pacing of how we work on videos.
[3225.82 → 3228.44] Someone in the chat asked, do Float plane videos ever hit YouTube?
[3228.64 → 3229.66] Yes, all of them.
[3229.92 → 3230.14] Yep.
[3230.36 → 3231.74] That is definitely the idea.
[3231.74 → 3240.78] Sometimes the window ends up being longer than a week because timely videos go in the slot that it's supposed to go in, and it gets bumped back and weird things happen.
[3240.88 → 3242.22] But they always eventually hit YouTube.
[3243.86 → 3244.74] And honestly...
[3245.40 → 3246.80] I actually have a great example of that.
[3247.24 → 3247.84] So, see this?
[3247.92 → 3250.44] The RX 570 and 580 review.
[3250.44 → 3252.08] That went up simultaneously.
[3252.50 → 3252.62] Yeah.
[3253.20 → 3262.66] And for that reason, going back further, the Red Weapon unboxing is not up on YouTube yet, even though it was posted on Float plane Club on April 13th.
[3262.70 → 3263.00] Yeah.
[3263.10 → 3267.90] So, something like a Red Epic unboxing, those Red Weapon unboxing, is awesome.
[3268.06 → 3269.06] I think it's super cool.
[3269.32 → 3270.22] I'm excited to see it.
[3270.24 → 3270.96] But it's not time-sensitive.
[3271.22 → 3271.40] Yeah.
[3271.62 → 3272.70] It's not a new camera.
[3272.70 → 3277.24] It's an equally relevant piece of content two weeks from now, three weeks from now, quite frankly.
[3278.04 → 3280.44] And a large percentage of people...
[3280.44 → 3283.66] You guys are watching WAN show, so you guys have probably heard about Float plane before.
[3284.02 → 3289.22] But a fairly large percentage of people, when Vessel died, thought we just didn't have that anymore.
[3289.68 → 3290.16] Right.
[3291.38 → 3293.30] And didn't notice anything changed.
[3294.36 → 3295.64] Because nothing changed.
[3295.88 → 3296.44] Nothing changes!
[3296.68 → 3298.68] You still get the exact same amount of videos.
[3299.22 → 3301.58] They're just also somewhere else a little bit early.
[3301.58 → 3304.00] So, if you're not interested in Float plane, don't worry about it.
[3304.24 → 3305.00] Enjoy your life.
[3305.20 → 3305.98] Have a happy day.
[3306.32 → 3306.42] Yeah.
[3306.72 → 3312.14] But if you want to see some stuff in a place that honestly has better comments, and hopefully...
[3312.14 → 3314.42] It does have a less cancerous comment section, I'll say that.
[3314.58 → 3314.68] Yeah.
[3314.80 → 3316.94] And that drives us to engage with it more, too.
[3317.18 → 3317.64] Which is...
[3317.64 → 3317.66] Yep.
[3317.78 → 3319.62] There are more comments from internal staff on there.
[3319.76 → 3319.92] Yeah.
[3320.84 → 3324.82] And, like, better bit rates in most scenarios, because it's variable.
[3325.04 → 3325.26] Okay.
[3325.32 → 3327.22] This guy's tried to ask this question a handful of times.
[3328.22 → 3330.46] Would you guys ever get people like Team Four Star?
[3330.46 → 3331.90] I have no idea what that is.
[3332.00 → 3332.18] Yeah.
[3332.58 → 3333.26] Do you know what that is?
[3333.40 → 3333.90] Not a clue.
[3334.00 → 3334.22] Okay.
[3334.36 → 3335.62] And how would you handle DMCA?
[3335.84 → 3340.32] So, DMCA, we would handle it the same way we're required to, by law.
[3340.58 → 3340.76] Yeah.
[3341.26 → 3344.40] As for creators, I'm assuming their, like, edgy or something.
[3344.40 → 3351.02] So, at least for the foreseeable future, creators would be on an invitation-only basis.
[3351.66 → 3351.84] Yeah.
[3351.96 → 3357.32] Because it opens us up to a lot of liability to be hosting video content from our site, we
[3357.32 → 3359.26] would have to make sure that it's people that we trust.
[3359.32 → 3365.02] So, you would expect the initial roster to be people who we know personally.
[3365.42 → 3365.64] Yeah.
[3365.72 → 3366.48] And that's about it.
[3366.48 → 3372.84] A big part of that is we don't want to grow too fast and break the prop or something.
[3373.14 → 3376.66] I've got someone asking, would we be able to make an exclusive series for Float plane
[3376.66 → 3378.10] Club, like Nerd Sports was on Vessel?
[3378.26 → 3378.52] Yes.
[3378.52 → 3384.76] We would do nothing to prevent a creator from uploading exclusive content and using Float plane
[3384.76 → 3385.52] Club as...
[3386.04 → 3388.52] So, you've got to understand what the creator page is going to look like.
[3388.68 → 3390.80] It's going to look like your page.
[3391.42 → 3396.52] Float plane Club takes only, like, the sliver down the left and, I think, a top banner.
[3397.46 → 3397.58] Yeah.
[3397.76 → 3399.60] Everything else is branded the creator.
[3399.60 → 3406.86] And unless the person browsing that page actively follows other creators, we don't plan to have
[3406.86 → 3409.02] a ton of discoverability tools included.
[3409.24 → 3409.46] No.
[3409.58 → 3415.22] The idea is that a creator would be able to direct their viewer to their page, engage one-on-one,
[3415.38 → 3419.28] and not have to worry about any BS that happens in between that.
[3419.34 → 3424.28] So, whatever it is that they want to deliver, we want them to have the ability to upload it,
[3424.28 → 3428.28] manage it the way that they want, and deliver a really high-quality viewing experience.
[3428.28 → 3434.40] And because the platform will be paid, every view will be paid for at some point, so people
[3434.40 → 3438.80] that are subscribed to us on Float plane Club right now are paying three bucks a month, we
[3438.80 → 3439.80] can afford to do that.
[3440.58 → 3445.12] And I've had people point out to me, well, YouTube could flip a switch and double their
[3445.12 → 3445.58] bit rates.
[3446.40 → 3447.10] I disagree.
[3447.92 → 3453.68] In fact, I think that because of their scale, they're actually less likely to do that.
[3453.68 → 3460.84] If it were to cost YouTube a fraction of a cent more to deliver each view, that would
[3460.84 → 3462.42] actually add up to something real.
[3462.80 → 3462.98] Yeah.
[3463.06 → 3468.50] Whereas if it costs us a fraction of a cent more to increase the bit rate of every view,
[3468.80 → 3469.48] what do we care?
[3469.82 → 3470.00] Yeah.
[3471.00 → 3471.44] Yeah.
[3471.52 → 3473.06] It's a very interesting experience.
[3473.18 → 3477.50] And like he said with the maybe stuff that doesn't go on YouTube or whatever, a creator
[3477.50 → 3478.34] can do that.
[3478.40 → 3479.72] We don't have any plans to do that.
[3479.72 → 3482.96] But a creator could do that if they wanted.
[3483.02 → 3486.02] I actually have thought about it, but just like cell phone footage.
[3487.28 → 3487.64] Okay.
[3487.74 → 3488.62] Yeah, not like real videos.
[3488.74 → 3492.42] Well, that would be maybe where like we'd have like an additional feed.
[3493.14 → 3493.38] Yeah.
[3493.82 → 3497.10] Because there's like, there's a, I'm not going to go way too into it right now, but
[3497.10 → 3498.38] the like the other section.
[3499.54 → 3500.04] Which one?
[3503.94 → 3505.02] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3505.10 → 3505.24] Yeah.
[3505.30 → 3507.30] So it could just go in like a different area.
[3507.56 → 3509.14] Watch the mic have picked that up anyway.
[3509.96 → 3511.34] People are asking what about YouTube Red?
[3511.40 → 3511.92] Yeah, what about it?
[3512.24 → 3514.72] So YouTube Red is site-wide and includes Google Play Music.
[3514.92 → 3515.66] Great product.
[3516.16 → 3518.00] We think people should subscribe to YouTube Red.
[3518.38 → 3524.96] It dramatically increases the purview, like the purview earnings for the creators that
[3524.96 → 3525.38] you love.
[3525.58 → 3525.74] Yeah.
[3525.74 → 3530.42] And there is absolutely no reason not to continue to enjoy YouTube Red.
[3530.42 → 3537.08] I mean, for us, really, we want to challenge creators to come up with different and new
[3537.08 → 3540.92] ways to make Float plane Club worthwhile for their viewers.
[3541.42 → 3542.62] So, you know, we'd love to build-
[3542.62 → 3547.22] We're also not going to be the like, developers, developers, developers, where we're just going
[3547.22 → 3548.40] to put it completely in their hands.
[3548.48 → 3550.94] We'll have some like guidelines and suggestions of how they can do stuff.
[3551.54 → 3551.72] Yeah.
[3551.72 → 3558.52] So the idea would be like, you know, on YouTube Red, it's pretty straightforward.
[3559.10 → 3561.54] You subscribe to YouTube Red, you don't see ads.
[3562.54 → 3562.96] That's it.
[3563.44 → 3564.38] That's all there is to it.
[3564.90 → 3565.96] What if you had other ideas?
[3566.06 → 3571.02] What if you had ideas like you wanted a subscriber-only chat for the first half an hour?
[3571.94 → 3576.16] What if you had ideas like you wanted people to have custom emojis?
[3576.92 → 3580.16] You know, things that are available on other platforms like Twitch, but not on YouTube.
[3580.70 → 3584.78] What if you had ideas like you wanted to have a mailing list, like a newsletter or something?
[3584.96 → 3586.28] Are you going to do that through YouTube Red?
[3586.94 → 3587.30] No.
[3588.16 → 3589.40] So it's a toolbox.
[3590.04 → 3590.76] That's the idea.
[3591.22 → 3591.38] Yeah.
[3594.38 → 3597.78] Okay.
[3598.08 → 3600.30] Well, I don't want the whole stream to end up being about this.
[3600.92 → 3603.22] Although I will say that we're not losing viewers.
[3603.34 → 3604.96] People are apparently pretty interested in it.
[3605.56 → 3607.54] But let's go ahead.
[3607.60 → 3610.50] Let's move on to some of the other stuff that's going on.
[3610.50 → 3612.38] The original article here is from CNBC.
[3614.14 → 3615.52] Nintendo's NEW Mini.
[3616.26 → 3621.78] Apparently, the rumour is, allegedly, Nintendo was discontinuing the NEW Mini
[3621.78 → 3630.20] in order to make room for the SNES Mini, which will, humouredly, be ready for the end of the year.
[3631.44 → 3633.46] I love this sub-headline here.
[3633.74 → 3638.12] The SNES had popular games, including Super Mario World and Donkey Kong Country.
[3638.32 → 3638.62] Really?
[3638.86 → 3640.50] The SNES had popular games?
[3640.50 → 3642.66] You have got to be kidding me.
[3643.46 → 3644.36] No way.
[3644.86 → 3648.30] Apparently, some NEW Classic consoles are on eBay for as much as five grand.
[3648.38 → 3649.00] That's stupid.
[3649.46 → 3649.76] What?
[3650.88 → 3651.32] Anyway.
[3653.20 → 3653.60] Okay.
[3653.76 → 3653.90] Yeah.
[3653.90 → 3654.72] That's pretty straightforward.
[3656.00 → 3657.66] I basically covered everything that was.
[3657.66 → 3661.82] So the new SNES will also have plug-and-play set up and an array of games which come pre-installed
[3661.82 → 3662.88] and ready to play.
[3663.12 → 3663.50] Okay.
[3663.70 → 3667.68] Well, like, maybe some random dude put one up for five grand that no one's buying.
[3669.14 → 3671.72] Because there are other ones that are not $5,000.
[3672.76 → 3675.14] They look like $200 to $300 on average.
[3677.64 → 3679.42] Which is a lot, but it's not five grand.
[3679.58 → 3680.58] It's a little blown out of proportion.
[3681.40 → 3685.44] Cosplay goes bad for a gamer in Grand Prairie.
[3685.70 → 3687.42] Or goes really, really well.
[3687.42 → 3689.14] I have an alternative take on this.
[3689.22 → 3689.76] Go for it, though.
[3690.82 → 3696.64] Basically, the guy was walking around the street with wearing what looked like a bomb on his back.
[3696.72 → 3701.06] He was dressed as a character from Fallout, wearing a gas mask, helmet, armour, and bullet belt,
[3701.48 → 3704.04] carrying a flag that said New California Republic.
[3704.84 → 3707.42] So, first up, you're an idiot.
[3708.74 → 3709.68] So there's that.
[3710.08 → 3710.48] A little bit.
[3711.16 → 3714.72] At least eight officers responded with their long guns drawn.
[3714.72 → 3717.48] Yes, we do have guns in Canada.
[3717.90 → 3722.16] And yes, if you walk around looking like you're loaded for bear,
[3722.46 → 3723.16] We actually have...
[3723.16 → 3724.74] You will get them pulled on you.
[3725.00 → 3727.54] Per capita, Canada has a lot of guns.
[3727.76 → 3728.16] Yeah, I know.
[3728.32 → 3730.74] Like, a huge amount compared to most countries.
[3730.74 → 3739.20] He was observed going into a lens alteration because he wanted some alterations made to the costume.
[3740.20 → 3743.42] Through conversation with the man, police were able to determine that he was wearing a costume
[3743.42 → 3745.10] and that there was no threat to the public.
[3745.40 → 3750.98] What had looked like a bomb turned out to be several Pringles potato chip cans that were painted silver.
[3750.98 → 3758.74] The man was taken into custody but later released without any charges and probably a stern talking to about being a complete idiot.
[3759.06 → 3761.76] So I think this is fantastic for the guy.
[3762.38 → 3764.40] Like, one of the best things that could have happened to him.
[3764.72 → 3766.04] Reason being...
[3766.04 → 3766.42] Uh-huh.
[3767.30 → 3769.42] A lot of cosplayers want to get sponsored.
[3769.70 → 3770.58] I'm settling in here.
[3770.68 → 3776.02] He made a cosplay costume that was good enough to fool the police, to get guns drawn on him, to get him pulled in.
[3776.02 → 3780.76] Okay, so I'm going to stop you right there and say you're as much of an idiot as him.
[3781.46 → 3783.02] I see this in a similar...
[3783.02 → 3783.04] Because...
[3783.04 → 3789.72] You were there when we were doing the first channel super fun.
[3789.86 → 3790.84] Okay, yeah.
[3790.96 → 3794.98] On the bug assault, a bright yellow gun...
[3794.98 → 3796.30] They didn't draw guns on you, though.
[3796.32 → 3800.36] A bright yellow gun that fires salt to kill flies.
[3800.64 → 3801.58] They thought it was an assault.
[3801.58 → 3802.56] Two officers.
[3802.56 → 3802.68] Two officers.
[3803.00 → 3807.60] They have to respond if someone reports someone with a gun.
[3807.76 → 3807.98] Yeah.
[3808.22 → 3809.78] So it was an idiot neighbour.
[3809.96 → 3811.24] It could have been any idiot.
[3811.52 → 3812.88] The police had to respond.
[3813.02 → 3815.10] But there was eight of them, and they drew guns.
[3815.16 → 3815.78] Okay, that's fair.
[3817.00 → 3820.22] If I remember correctly, they just walked up casually and were like, okay.
[3820.50 → 3820.84] Yo, dog.
[3820.84 → 3824.14] Maybe don't walk around swinging it around because, like, your neighbours are crazy.
[3824.14 → 3824.92] They thought it was cool.
[3825.12 → 3825.32] Yeah.
[3825.38 → 3825.96] They tried it.
[3826.12 → 3826.36] Yeah.
[3826.36 → 3826.64] Yeah.
[3826.74 → 3828.02] They were actually pretty cool cops.
[3828.14 → 3830.26] Like, they didn't draw guns.
[3830.40 → 3831.08] It's a little bit different.
[3831.08 → 3834.28] So this guy can take this and go, like, look, my cosplay is so good.
[3834.40 → 3835.80] It fooled eight different cops.
[3835.90 → 3836.70] They drew guns on me.
[3836.80 → 3837.44] It's impressive.
[3837.66 → 3838.56] Bring me to your convention.
[3838.74 → 3840.02] Pay me to make a cosplay thing.
[3840.22 → 3840.74] I'm there.
[3841.62 → 3843.56] Could be the best thing that's ever happened to his career.
[3844.02 → 3844.40] Terrible.
[3846.28 → 3847.28] Man claims.
[3847.84 → 3849.90] This is from ArsTechnica.com.
[3849.90 → 3854.28] His Bose headphones intercept what he's listening to.
[3854.36 → 3861.10] An Illinois man says, my headphones transmit audio metadata to dataminerssegment.io.
[3861.62 → 3864.18] Why would they be doing this?
[3865.86 → 3866.38] Brutal.
[3866.94 → 3867.76] It's a claim.
[3867.76 → 3873.92] The civil complaint alleges that Bose collects the names of any music and audio tracks played
[3873.92 → 3877.82] through the headphones along with the customer's personally identifiable serial number.
[3878.52 → 3883.50] It also says this information gets sent to third parties, including dataminerssegment.io.
[3884.02 → 3888.58] Bose's lawyers likely will argue that while it may be sending out copies of the metadata,
[3889.04 → 3895.58] artist's song title, etc., its actions do not constitute contents of any wire or oral or electronic
[3895.58 → 3898.30] communication as defined under the relevant wiretap law.
[3899.06 → 3901.46] Therefore, it could argue that they are not liable.
[3903.96 → 3909.02] The counterpoint is that Bose products interact with consumer smartphones which transmit operational
[3909.02 → 3912.58] instructions regarding skipping and rewinding audio tracks which would be content.
[3913.52 → 3914.36] Holy crap.
[3914.94 → 3916.22] What the hell, man?
[3916.48 → 3917.10] Super lame.
[3917.28 → 3918.12] Don't like it at all.
[3919.50 → 3923.24] Like, is it not enough to get the $2.99 that someone, like, no.
[3923.78 → 3925.26] What are their wireless, they're like $3.99.
[3925.58 → 3926.06] They're really expensive.
[3926.08 → 3926.78] They're really expensive.
[3926.92 → 3931.58] You already got $400 for a bomb cost that has got to be less than $100.
[3932.06 → 3934.88] We need someone else to make perfect active noise-cancelling headphones.
[3935.36 → 3935.72] Sennheiser.
[3936.68 → 3937.82] PXC 550s are very good.
[3937.86 → 3938.94] I liked the...
[3938.94 → 3940.10] I tried both of them.
[3940.22 → 3941.56] The Bose ones were way more comfortable.
[3941.82 → 3942.50] They are more comfortable.
[3943.20 → 3944.14] You just said perfect.
[3944.56 → 3945.82] You didn't say really more comfortable.
[3946.04 → 3947.26] Perfect is an over...
[3947.26 → 3948.22] They sound perfect.
[3948.26 → 3948.70] They sound better.
[3949.10 → 3949.32] Yeah.
[3949.82 → 3950.50] I believe that.
[3950.50 → 3950.68] I'm just saying.
[3951.04 → 3951.20] Yeah.
[3951.68 → 3952.16] I'm just saying.
[3952.48 → 3953.82] Which I found kind of surprising.
[3953.82 → 3954.36] It's a free country.
[3954.44 → 3954.92] I can just say.
[3954.92 → 3961.88] That I liked the Bose Comfort more because I wear Sennheiser headphones and I prefer Sennheiser
[3961.88 → 3965.90] sound signature, and I'm very used to how most Sennheiser headphones sit on your head.
[3966.08 → 3970.84] Sennheiser's audiophile line, the HD line, has a different feel that I wish they would
[3970.84 → 3973.78] just abandon all their other feels and just stick with.
[3973.98 → 3974.14] Yeah.
[3974.14 → 3975.14] But it's not very...
[3975.14 → 3977.02] It feels good.
[3977.02 → 3977.26] It's not very portable.
[3977.56 → 3979.28] It's not very portable, and it doesn't look very good.
[3979.42 → 3979.58] Yeah.
[3979.96 → 3980.88] So I get it.
[3981.10 → 3981.30] But...
[3981.30 → 3981.46] Yeah.
[3981.78 → 3982.00] Yeah.
[3985.04 → 3986.68] Microsoft is doing its own Chromebook thing.
[3987.46 → 3988.14] It's kind of weird.
[3988.18 → 3988.64] That's pretty cool.
[3988.76 → 3990.60] So our original article here is from TechCrunch.
[3990.60 → 3997.20] So it's supposed to be one of those like EDU-cloud kind of devices that's very targeted at education
[3997.20 → 3999.40] stuff because it's supposed to be cheap.
[3999.40 → 3999.50] No pictures.
[3999.50 → 4000.24] It's been effective.
[4001.58 → 4003.32] No pictures of it like you just said.
[4003.52 → 4004.40] But yeah.
[4004.66 → 4007.16] Low-end laptop, cloud-based services.
[4007.36 → 4008.10] All-day battery.
[4008.94 → 4010.64] Quad-core Intel Celeron processor.
[4010.64 → 4011.52] That shouldn't be that bad.
[4011.58 → 4012.10] I mean, quad-core.
[4012.56 → 4017.22] So it's probably going to lose because it's Microsoft's cloud services versus anything.
[4018.52 → 4019.00] Wow.
[4020.22 → 4022.50] You're as savage as this jerky.
[4022.74 → 4023.02] Oh.
[4023.24 → 4023.52] Oh.
[4025.02 → 4026.24] Seriously though, that's mean.
[4026.42 → 4027.38] I mean...
[4027.38 → 4027.88] Is it wrong?
[4027.92 → 4028.40] What's it called?
[4028.50 → 4029.70] Skydive or OneDrive now?
[4029.74 → 4030.78] I can't even keep track anymore.
[4030.88 → 4031.62] I think OneDrive.
[4031.84 → 4032.18] OneDrive.
[4032.72 → 4033.34] Is it that bad?
[4033.78 → 4034.82] I hate it.
[4034.98 → 4035.90] You upload the file?
[4036.20 → 4036.74] Don't like it.
[4037.18 → 4037.78] I don't like it either.
[4037.78 → 4038.10] No.
[4040.64 → 4042.48] All right.
[4043.04 → 4043.76] That one's weird.
[4045.38 → 4046.26] Oh, Apple.
[4046.68 → 4046.98] Yeah.
[4047.42 → 4047.94] Apple.
[4048.54 → 4051.48] Whole home water cooling.
[4051.72 → 4052.06] Heating.
[4053.40 → 4054.86] You're ruining my buzz right now.
[4055.52 → 4056.58] You're just...
[4056.58 → 4057.28] You're hashing it.
[4058.96 → 4068.70] Apple, originally posted by PC World, will return heat generated by the data centre to warm up homes.
[4068.70 → 4071.00] So this is being done in Denmark.
[4071.10 → 4075.64] This is a new data centre that's focused on returning to the community.
[4075.64 → 4077.94] So it's...
[4077.94 → 4079.92] It'll be fully powered by renewable energy.
[4080.14 → 4085.18] Part of it coming from recycling waste products from farms and won't put stress on the local grid.
[4085.70 → 4089.40] And they're making a major push to be one of the greenest companies on the planet.
[4090.60 → 4098.80] The new corporate headquarters that I wonder how much it costs in building materials and how much that all harmed the earth to salvage from wherever they got it.
[4098.84 → 4099.56] Anyway, that's not the point.
[4099.56 → 4103.90] Their new corporate headquarters called Apple Park will run on renewable energy.
[4104.14 → 4109.12] They've also cut their use of toxic materials and are using more recycled materials and products and packaging.
[4110.68 → 4111.40] Pretty epic.
[4112.16 → 4112.78] All right.
[4114.32 → 4115.60] I guess that's pretty much it.
[4116.22 → 4116.66] Yep.
[4117.26 → 4118.72] Well, thank you for watching the WAN show.
[4119.56 → 4122.66] And thank you for participating in the WAN show.
[4122.84 → 4123.50] Thank you as well.
[4123.98 → 4124.38] Thank you.
[4124.46 → 4125.58] It's been a good week.
[4125.58 → 4126.24] Yeah, it has.
[4129.78 → 4131.02] I ate this whole pack.
[4132.32 → 4132.96] It's gone.
[4133.08 → 4136.48] It'll take me a lot longer to get through my Mojo Habanero.
[4136.50 → 4138.56] I love the maple bacon.
[4138.96 → 4140.12] I like the Mojo Habanero.
[4140.32 → 4147.46] The ghost pepper one, when I pulled this out, was when I could have had another ghost pepper one if I really wanted to.
[4147.60 → 4148.58] But it's like...
[4148.58 → 4152.68] It's like just slightly outside my comfortable tolerance level.
[4152.68 → 4160.06] The Mojo Habanero is like right in where it's like, all right, this is 95% flavour, 5% uncomfortable burn.
[4160.06 → 4161.34] That was the one with the citrus, right?
[4162.16 → 4163.06] I think so.
[4163.44 → 4163.98] That one's nice.
[4164.12 → 4164.38] It's good.
[4164.60 → 4164.76] Yeah.
[4165.28 → 4166.38] Anyway, sorry.
[4166.84 → 4167.58] I got a little distracted there.
[4167.58 → 4169.42] Lime juice is the second ingredient.
[4170.36 → 4170.68] Intro.
[4171.22 → 4171.66] Outro.
[4171.94 → 4172.52] It's the end.
[4173.50 → 4175.94] And then water and then orange juice and then lemon juice.
[4176.70 → 4177.52] That makes sense.
[4177.60 → 4178.16] Why you got citrus?
[4178.16 → 4181.38] Oh, I read the ingredients.
[4182.04 → 4182.90] That's why I said citrus.
[4183.02 → 4183.16] Oh.
[4183.80 → 4184.08] Oh.
[4185.12 → 4186.12] You want to do this?
[4186.92 → 4187.46] You need to go.
[4188.24 → 4189.62] I have to film two videos.
[4190.08 → 4191.60] Ed's staying with me after work.
[4191.68 → 4192.44] I would love to, though.
[4193.20 → 4193.94] I'll leave it here.
[4194.36 → 4194.68] Soon.
[4194.78 → 4195.40] Hashtag soon.
[4195.54 → 4196.48] I will leave it right here.
[4196.56 → 4197.70] It's like people will steal my stuff.
[4197.94 → 4198.22] Okay.
[4199.20 → 4200.88] I can't promise no one will steal your stuff.
[4201.06 → 4201.32] Yeah.
[4201.90 → 4202.66] Look at this.
[4202.84 → 4203.18] P.S.
[4203.24 → 4204.80] The sriracha bacon is amazing.
[4204.94 → 4205.24] Colton.
[4206.24 → 4207.80] Colton, you're not on the WAN show.
[4208.76 → 4209.38] Forget it.
[4209.48 → 4211.26] Stop trying to insert yourself into the WAN show.
[4211.36 → 4212.46] He came and stole a bag.
[4212.66 → 4213.04] I know.
[4213.20 → 4213.82] I hate that guy.
[4213.82 → 4213.94] I love it.
[4213.94 → 4214.00] I love it.
[4214.00 → 4214.44] I love it.
[4214.44 → 4214.60] I love it.
[4214.60 → 4214.62] I love it.
