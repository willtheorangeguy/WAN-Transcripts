[0.00 → 7.62] And we are live coming to you from gorgeous Coverdale British Columbia
[7.62 → 15.00] Coming to you from slightly run down Coverdale British Columbia
[15.00 → 21.02] Lots of farmland not great farmland I don't even know what they grow here
[21.02 → 25.00] British Columbia and a ancient McDonald's
[25.00 → 26.50] British Columbia
[26.50 → 31.48] We have great news this week
[31.48 → 34.88] We are proud, proud Cloverdalians
[34.88 → 36.58] We have the best news from Coverdale this week
[36.58 → 38.18] Actually I don't live in Coverdale
[38.18 → 39.90] And I'm not sad
[39.90 → 40.78] Me neither
[40.78 → 45.38] No offence, no offence to anyone from Coverdale who may be watching
[45.38 → 48.52] Because you probably didn't understand what we said anyway
[48.52 → 52.00] You have a really great horse accessory and saddle store
[52.00 → 52.82] It's wonderful
[52.82 → 55.78] Anyway, there are tons of Vega news
[55.78 → 60.12] Like every single other WAN show from 2017
[60.12 → 61.26] So that's not too surprising
[61.26 → 63.78] All the Vega leaks
[63.78 → 67.66] Like if there was a Crossfire leak
[67.66 → 69.12] It would be like Vega Bond
[69.12 → 69.78] I think
[69.78 → 71.54] Because you put them together
[71.54 → 73.60] Oh my goodness
[73.60 → 75.00] I think if Vega was a ship
[75.00 → 76.44] It just wouldn't have a bottom anymore
[76.44 → 79.04] Because it sank
[79.04 → 80.08] No, because the leaks
[80.08 → 80.76] There are so many leaks
[80.76 → 81.42] Oh
[81.42 → 86.96] No, only I'm allowed to make jokes that bad
[86.96 → 88.94] Sorry, no
[88.94 → 90.38] You don't have
[90.38 → 93.58] You don't have a terrible, terrible joke privilege
[93.58 → 96.78] That I enjoy
[96.78 → 97.86] I'm trying to graduate
[97.86 → 98.94] I'm working on it
[98.94 → 101.24] It's not so much a graduation
[101.24 → 105.58] As a sort of debasing of yourself
[105.58 → 106.58] Yeah
[106.58 → 107.58] Yeah
[107.58 → 108.58] Yeah
[108.58 → 108.92] Yeah
[108.92 → 109.58] Yeah
[109.58 → 111.52] We've got rumours about price
[111.52 → 113.58] We've got rumours about performance
[113.58 → 114.98] We've got tons of stuff
[114.98 → 116.16] So stay tuned for that
[116.16 → 117.72] Rumours about what it looks like
[117.72 → 120.48] We also have the Intel Core X series
[120.48 → 122.44] Full specs have apparently been leaked
[122.44 → 123.60] There's leaks all over the place
[123.60 → 124.84] Is it even leaks anymore?
[125.02 → 125.54] Who knows?
[125.64 → 126.52] What's a Core X?
[126.52 → 127.46] I don't even know
[127.46 → 129.92] Uh, Flash is going to die in 2020
[129.92 → 130.42] Yeah
[130.42 → 131.76] Unlike all the other times
[131.76 → 132.46] That it's been stated
[132.46 → 133.36] Flash is going to die
[133.36 → 133.62] Yeah
[133.62 → 134.42] Hopefully this time
[134.42 → 135.84] It's actually going to die
[135.84 → 137.44] It's like actually super
[137.44 → 139.62] Super actually dying this time
[139.62 → 140.58] So that's pretty sick
[140.58 → 141.02] Yeah

[161.94 → 163.36] I don't know
[163.36 → 164.64] If that's good
[164.64 → 166.92] So much as it's bad
[166.92 → 168.58] It's bad
[168.58 → 170.58] Intro time
[170.58 → 180.34] NCI no
[180.34 → 182.06] NCI no
[182.06 → 190.52] Intro yes

[214.78 → 215.42] The tattoo
[215.42 → 218.18] Naked yes
[218.18 → 219.84] My wife would kill me
[219.84 → 224.58] Every single time
[224.58 → 227.44] She would
[227.44 → 228.34] She would like
[228.34 → 230.70] She would actually be fear
[230.70 → 232.34] Like she's not really
[232.34 → 234.46] Like getting mad kind of person
[234.46 → 235.60] She's more of a like
[235.60 → 238.76] Disappointed and frustrated person
[238.76 → 239.00] Yeah
[239.00 → 240.76] Not like a mad
[240.76 → 242.22] Like yelling person
[242.22 → 244.06] But that would actually be a thing
[244.06 → 244.70] I could do
[244.70 → 246.66] That would be like
[246.66 → 248.50] Full on like trigger mode
[248.50 → 251.56] I could see that
[251.56 → 252.80] Fake tattoo yes
[252.80 → 253.94] Oh fake tattoo
[253.94 → 256.02] In the promotional materials
[256.02 → 257.14] You could have a fake tattoo
[257.14 → 259.02] She doesn't watch YouTube
[259.02 → 260.60] So like
[260.60 → 261.00] Or rather
[261.00 → 261.64] WAN show
[261.64 → 261.98] YouTube
[261.98 → 262.50] I'm sorry
[262.50 → 263.42] I am like
[263.42 → 264.78] Exhausted
[264.78 → 265.86] Today's been crazy

[270.22 → 270.70] This should be
[270.70 → 271.32] She doesn't watch
[271.32 → 272.72] This should be a channel super fun break
[272.72 → 273.26] Yeah
[273.26 → 274.56] Because you could say
[274.56 → 275.04] That it was like
[275.04 → 275.80] A promotional thing
[275.80 → 276.20] For the shirt
[276.20 → 277.02] And you don't really care
[277.02 → 277.54] Because you're all just

[286.34 → 287.06] Thank you very much
[287.06 → 287.26] I appreciate it
[287.26 → 288.50] So the only problem
[288.50 → 289.76] Is that we wouldn't be able
[289.76 → 290.92] To do it on Twitch
[290.92 → 292.58] Unless I got some
[292.58 → 293.68] Some tape
[293.68 → 294.18] Actually
[294.18 → 295.86] Alex do you have
[295.86 → 296.78] Some electrical tape
[296.78 → 297.50] That I could borrow
[297.50 → 298.82] It seems like
[298.82 → 299.34] The kind of thing
[299.34 → 300.28] You would have on hand
[300.28 → 301.54] I think it would look
[301.54 → 302.20] Really fake
[302.20 → 303.30] No, no
[303.30 → 303.66] Hold on
[303.66 → 304.38] The black one

[311.92 → 313.14] Oh you're going to
[313.14 → 314.06] Tape them over
[314.06 → 315.22] So basically
[315.22 → 316.34] I figure
[316.34 → 316.72] Wow
[316.72 → 317.72] Wow
[317.72 → 318.20] With the
[318.20 → 319.82] I can't believe

[322.74 → 323.26] Okay
[323.26 → 323.90] Okay
[323.90 → 325.32] So I could pull off
[325.32 → 325.78] The shirt
[325.78 → 326.74] And then I could have
[326.74 → 327.38] Like the
[327.38 → 328.20] The
[328.20 → 328.88] The
[328.88 → 329.58] The
[329.58 → 330.48] No nipple
[330.48 → 332.06] Shirtless
[332.06 → 332.46] Right
[332.46 → 335.82] So it would be like
[335.82 → 337.32] Shirt no
[337.32 → 338.60] And then like
[338.60 → 338.86] Woo
[338.86 → 339.82] Naked yes
[339.82 → 340.50] And then
[340.50 → 341.60] Yeah

[350.28 → 350.78] This whole
[350.78 → 352.14] This whole show
[352.14 → 353.36] We used to do
[353.36 → 354.00] Staples
[354.00 → 355.60] Now we've evolved
[355.60 → 356.62] Into just like

[370.72 → 371.44] Reason for that
[371.44 → 372.04] No there's a
[372.04 → 372.98] Valid reason for that
[372.98 → 373.32] Okay
[373.32 → 374.56] Because FreshBooks
[374.56 → 375.30] Is the sponsor

[544.32 → 545.30] Like actually
[545.30 → 546.46] An insane amount
[546.46 → 547.54] Like actually
[547.54 → 549.00] Every single person
[549.00 → 549.62] Who attends
[549.62 → 550.48] Should walk away
[550.48 → 551.88] With multiple
[551.88 → 552.98] Pieces of swag
[552.98 → 554.56] And I'm not talking
[554.56 → 555.30] Like everybody's
[555.30 → 556.16] Going to get a graphics card
[556.16 → 556.74] But there will be
[556.74 → 557.90] Graphics card giveaways
[557.90 → 558.64] Which like
[558.64 → 559.18] That's a thing
[559.18 → 560.22] I think that's super cool
[560.22 → 560.78] Because I'm
[560.78 → 561.52] I'm kind of
[561.52 → 562.06] I'm kind of
[562.06 → 563.16] Into the whole swag thing
[563.16 → 564.40] And PAX
[564.40 → 564.76] And all these
[564.76 → 565.54] Huge conventions
[565.54 → 566.28] It's been kind of
[566.28 → 567.02] Going down a little bit
[567.02 → 567.76] Because some of the
[567.76 → 568.48] Biggest proponents
[568.48 → 569.08] Of swag
[569.08 → 570.32] Was always the hardware
[570.32 → 571.14] The hardware guys
[571.14 → 571.80] Love the swag
[571.80 → 572.30] Yeah
[572.30 → 573.46] It's freaking awesome

[621.22 → 622.10] All the vegan news
[622.10 → 623.78] Uh
[623.78 → 624.84] Sure
[624.84 → 625.86] Okay
[625.86 → 626.82] There's a lot
[626.82 → 628.10] A lot of it's like
[628.10 → 629.72] Not quite a repeat
[629.72 → 630.10] But borderline
[630.46 → 630.96] Alright
[630.96 → 631.76] Yong Kang
[631.76 → 632.94] Yong Kang
[632.94 → 634.16] Posted this on the forum
[634.16 → 634.98] The original article
[634.98 → 635.34] Is from
[635.34 → 637.24] Videocards.com
[637.24 → 638.78] This is
[638.78 → 639.54] Apparently
[639.54 → 640.70] According to the
[640.70 → 641.68] Video cards leak
[641.68 → 642.20] What the
[642.20 → 643.14] Vega 64
[643.14 → 644.34] Reference design
[644.34 → 645.30] Will look like
[645.30 → 648.20] Something like that
[648.20 → 650.14] According to
[650.14 → 650.82] The leak
[650.82 → 652.06] I can neither
[652.06 → 653.10] Confirm nor deny
[653.10 → 654.94] That looks like
[654.94 → 656.00] Three DisplayPort
[656.00 → 656.32] Ports
[656.32 → 657.00] And an HDMI
[657.00 → 658.38] So DVI
[658.38 → 658.74] Is
[658.74 → 659.64] On
[659.64 → 660.02] Z
[660.02 → 661.20] That's
[661.20 → 661.94] Not surprising
[661.94 → 662.70] No more DVI
[662.70 → 663.64] No more VGA
[663.64 → 665.42] Both of those
[665.42 → 666.30] Are probably fine
[666.30 → 667.70] I don't like
[667.70 → 668.56] Not having VGA
[668.56 → 669.10] To be perfect
[669.10 → 669.84] Not having VGA
[669.84 → 670.36] Is a little annoying
[670.36 → 670.80] But like
[670.80 → 671.42] When was the last time
[671.42 → 672.08] You even had it
[672.08 → 672.92] It's been DVI
[672.92 → 674.32] So NVIDIA
[674.32 → 674.68] So NVIDIA did away
[674.68 → 675.06] With it
[675.06 → 675.82] I think on
[675.82 → 676.80] Pascal
[676.80 → 677.30] Yeah
[677.30 → 677.70] Yeah
[677.70 → 678.86] So AMD
[678.86 → 679.60] Has followed suit
[679.60 → 681.06] That looks like
[681.06 → 682.02] Two 8 pin connectors
[682.02 → 682.78] Which is interesting
[682.78 → 683.26] It does
[683.26 → 684.16] And then this is
[684.16 → 684.96] Apparently a
[684.96 → 685.74] Vega 64
[685.74 → 686.88] Limited edition
[686.88 → 688.52] Limited edition
[688.52 → 688.84] Yeah
[688.84 → 690.60] Okay
[690.60 → 692.34] And then they're saying
[692.34 → 693.86] There will be a liquid edition
[693.86 → 695.36] And there are no pictures
[695.36 → 696.00] Yet of that
[696.00 → 696.58] Oh interesting
[696.58 → 697.04] Okay
[697.04 → 697.92] So
[697.92 → 699.16] There's
[699.16 → 699.92] There's
[699.92 → 700.52] The leaks
[700.52 → 701.64] You can take those
[701.64 → 703.16] For what they are
[703.16 → 704.50] If the card looks like
[704.50 → 705.42] The top one though
[705.42 → 707.68] I actually
[707.68 → 708.16] You know what
[708.16 → 709.22] I'm not going to lie
[709.22 → 711.18] I like the look
[711.18 → 712.76] Of this design
[712.76 → 714.72] Better than I like the look
[714.72 → 716.64] Of the limited edition design
[716.64 → 717.10] Really
[717.10 → 717.98] Yeah
[717.98 → 719.18] So this looks like
[719.18 → 720.04] A brushed kind of thing
[720.04 → 721.02] Cause brushed
[721.02 → 722.00] Depending on whether
[722.00 → 723.40] It's like metal or plastic
[723.40 → 724.86] Can actually end up
[724.86 → 725.72] Looking kind of cheap
[725.72 → 726.08] Yeah
[726.08 → 726.48] You know
[726.48 → 726.84] Yeah
[726.84 → 727.76] That's fair
[727.76 → 729.54] I think if you have
[729.54 → 730.46] The right build
[730.46 → 731.68] And it's a limited edition
[731.68 → 733.20] So that might make sense
[733.20 → 734.26] The right build
[734.26 → 735.12] Accenting that
[735.12 → 736.22] Could look really cool
[736.22 → 737.78] If you have the right case
[737.78 → 738.40] You have the right
[738.40 → 739.00] Other components
[739.00 → 739.58] All that kind of stuff
[739.58 → 739.82] Right
[739.82 → 740.52] But then I feel like
[740.52 → 741.58] The non-limited edition
[741.58 → 742.44] And this makes sense
[742.44 → 743.48] Would go much better
[743.48 → 744.10] With a more
[744.10 → 745.40] Standard build
[745.40 → 745.80] Yeah
[745.80 → 746.60] Like I would need
[746.60 → 747.52] To build around this
[747.52 → 747.74] Yes
[747.74 → 748.90] And almost nothing
[748.90 → 750.16] Is like matte silver
[750.16 → 750.76] It would be difficult
[750.76 → 751.86] You'd have to do
[751.86 → 752.74] Some custom stuff
[752.74 → 753.08] Yeah
[753.08 → 753.90] But you could make
[753.90 → 755.18] Like a sick looking computer
[755.18 → 756.66] Like they're probably
[756.66 → 757.20] Going to make
[757.20 → 758.64] Like a showcase PC
[758.64 → 759.72] That's built around
[759.72 → 760.84] That limited edition card
[760.84 → 762.00] And it's going to look awesome
[762.00 → 762.38] Probably
[762.38 → 764.12] Okay
[764.12 → 765.46] Apparently
[765.46 → 766.24] Vega
[766.24 → 767.64] Fire strike scores
[767.64 → 768.36] Have appeared
[768.36 → 769.24] So this was posted
[769.24 → 770.88] By Delicious
[770.88 → 772.42] On the forum
[772.42 → 773.34] And the original article
[773.34 → 774.14] Here is again
[774.14 → 776.28] From videocards.com
[776.28 → 778.06] And they are claiming
[778.06 → 778.90] That these are
[778.90 → 780.44] Three separate
[780.44 → 782.10] Rivera scores
[782.10 → 782.48] Here
[782.48 → 786.22] The memory clocks
[786.22 → 787.32] Are all the same
[787.32 → 789.38] But the GPU clocks
[789.38 → 790.32] Apparently ranged
[790.32 → 791.52] From 1536
[791.52 → 792.44] To 1630
[792.44 → 793.16] Although I would
[793.16 → 793.68] Take that
[793.68 → 794.78] With a grain of salt
[794.78 → 796.44] Because I'm not sure
[796.44 → 797.92] Exactly how they are
[797.92 → 798.48] Measuring
[798.48 → 799.98] The GPU clock
[799.98 → 800.68] Whether it's like
[800.68 → 801.28] An average
[801.28 → 802.28] Of
[802.28 → 803.72] What's running
[803.72 → 804.48] During the actual
[804.48 → 804.86] Benchmark
[804.86 → 805.64] Because GPU clocks
[805.64 → 806.56] Are all over the place
[806.56 → 807.34] Depending on
[807.34 → 808.56] Power delivery
[808.56 → 809.08] And cooling
[809.08 → 809.80] These days
[809.80 → 811.38] So
[811.38 → 813.94] We'll have to see
[813.94 → 814.82] That's my thing
[814.82 → 815.44] With all these
[815.44 → 816.10] Rumours
[816.10 → 817.42] Is
[817.42 → 818.04] Especially with
[818.04 → 818.86] Performance ones
[818.86 → 819.68] I don't really care
[819.68 → 820.34] Until we actually
[820.34 → 821.04] Get it ourselves
[821.04 → 821.84] Or until
[821.84 → 822.92] Other reviews
[822.92 → 823.88] Actually start coming out
[823.88 → 825.22] Because like
[825.22 → 826.74] Who knows
[826.74 → 828.80] And
[828.80 → 830.22] This is interesting
[830.22 → 832.18] So this original article

[837.16 → 837.90] Here is from
[837.90 → 839.04] Sweeclockers
[839.04 → 840.64] Apparently
[840.64 → 842.62] Rivera
[842.62 → 843.64] And this is
[843.64 → 844.12] In
[844.12 → 845.18] Meatball
[845.18 → 846.68] So I can't read it

[848.04 → 852.04] I'm sorry
[852.04 → 852.48] Sweden
[852.48 → 853.36] You could
[853.36 → 854.28] I love you guys
[854.28 → 855.02] I love you guys
[855.02 → 855.32] Okay
[855.32 → 856.12] You could like
[856.12 → 856.48] Google Translate
[856.48 → 857.08] It's literally
[857.08 → 857.82] Giving you the option
[857.82 → 858.44] Right there
[858.44 → 859.16] Nope
[859.16 → 860.96] Not on the stream
[860.96 → 861.20] Apparently
[861.20 → 862.04] Not on the stream
[862.04 → 863.14] There you go
[863.14 → 864.10] Um
[864.10 → 864.78] So
[864.78 → 865.52] Wow
[865.52 → 865.72] This
[865.72 → 866.80] Google Translate
[866.80 → 867.78] Has gotten perfect
[867.78 → 868.54] That was pretty decent
[868.54 → 869.80] It starts to collapse
[869.80 → 870.88] Into AMD Vega
[870.88 → 872.66] And now circulates
[872.66 → 873.68] The first prize
[873.68 → 874.34] Information
[874.34 → 875.38] Behind the scenes
[875.38 → 876.96] Okay
[876.96 → 877.72] So it's pretty good
[877.72 → 877.82] Okay
[877.82 → 878.60] So it's pretty good
[878.60 → 879.02] Pretty good
[879.02 → 879.76] So close
[879.76 → 880.14] Yeah
[880.14 → 880.84] Um
[880.84 → 881.86] The meatball
[881.86 → 882.28] Yes
[882.28 → 888.54] Oh my goodness
[888.54 → 889.06] Okay
[889.06 → 889.70] So good
[889.70 → 891.24] Distributors in Europe
[891.24 → 895.10] Apparently have received pricing for Rivera
[895.10 → 899.28] In the 600 to 700 euro range
[899.28 → 899.84] Which is
[899.84 → 900.64] Which would be
[900.64 → 905.58] 705 to 820 US dollars
[905.58 → 906.02] Yeah
[906.02 → 907.00] Now
[907.00 → 908.42] It should be noted
[908.42 → 909.86] That this has to be taken
[909.86 → 911.34] With a grain of salt
[911.34 → 912.88] Because vendors
[912.88 → 914.36] Often give out
[914.36 → 915.42] Sort of
[915.42 → 916.30] Random pricing
[916.30 → 917.52] Like back when I used to work
[917.52 → 918.14] At NCI
[918.14 → 919.72] This would happen
[919.72 → 920.98] All the time
[920.98 → 922.02] Where we would just
[922.02 → 922.72] Like guess
[922.72 → 923.50] Yeah
[923.50 → 924.56] And we would
[924.56 → 926.58] Create a skew
[926.58 → 927.96] Because we couldn't
[927.96 → 929.26] Cut a PO to the vendor
[929.26 → 931.16] Unless we had a skew
[931.16 → 932.10] And then
[932.10 → 932.88] There were times
[932.88 → 933.18] Well no
[933.18 → 933.40] That
[933.40 → 933.90] I mean
[933.90 → 934.90] That makes sense
[934.90 → 936.14] Because when it arrives
[936.14 → 937.72] How would the labelling staff
[937.72 → 939.24] Like know what label to put on it
[939.24 → 940.16] And stuff
[940.16 → 941.70] But then why would you have to put a
[941.70 → 943.10] Can you just put a placeholder
[943.10 → 943.96] That isn't anything
[943.96 → 944.64] Um
[944.64 → 948.52] If our system was that sophisticated
[948.52 → 949.54] We could have done that
[949.54 → 949.80] Yes
[949.80 → 951.00] That doesn't sound sophisticated
[951.00 → 952.34] Yeah
[952.34 → 953.32] You know what
[953.32 → 954.48] Can you just
[954.48 → 956.58] All right
[956.58 → 957.24] Let's move on
[957.24 → 957.78] Okay
[957.78 → 958.32] Um
[958.32 → 959.02] So anyway
[959.02 → 959.50] It is
[959.50 → 960.80] It is fairly common
[960.80 → 961.52] For retailers
[961.52 → 962.30] To just kind of
[962.30 → 963.16] Put a price in
[963.16 → 964.56] But um
[964.56 → 966.84] The other
[966.84 → 967.08] Right
[967.08 → 967.52] The other reason
[967.52 → 968.18] To not do that
[968.18 → 969.28] Might be to hide
[969.28 → 970.26] The final pricing
[970.26 → 972.06] So there had been times
[972.06 → 973.70] When we would create a skew
[973.70 → 974.50] And we would put it in
[974.50 → 974.92] For like
[974.92 → 977.08] $99,999
[977.08 → 978.36] Or just zero
[978.36 → 978.92] Yeah
[978.92 → 979.32] No
[979.32 → 980.04] Because then people
[980.04 → 980.58] Would order it
[980.58 → 982.12] And there were
[982.12 → 982.70] Oh
[982.70 → 983.34] So
[983.34 → 985.06] So it's a purchasable skew
[985.06 → 985.60] I don't know
[985.60 → 987.14] Why don't you just have unreleased
[987.14 → 989.16] So there were several statuses
[989.16 → 989.36] Okay
[989.36 → 989.80] So we could
[989.80 → 990.96] There was hide status
[990.96 → 991.60] For a skew
[991.60 → 991.68] Okay
[991.68 → 992.00] Yeah
[992.00 → 993.14] Where you could manually
[993.14 → 994.26] Navigate to the page
[994.26 → 995.28] Um
[995.28 → 996.76] And hide status was useful
[996.76 → 997.70] For uh
[997.70 → 998.74] Validating that like
[998.74 → 999.90] Landing pages were working
[999.90 → 1000.24] And stuff
[1000.24 → 1000.76] So you could click
[1000.76 → 1000.96] Yeah
[1000.96 → 1001.62] Make sure everything's
[1001.62 → 1002.26] Actually working
[1002.26 → 1003.74] And there was
[1003.74 → 1004.32] Uh
[1004.32 → 1005.68] Discontinued status
[1005.68 → 1006.54] Okay
[1006.54 → 1006.72] Which
[1006.72 → 1008.00] You could load the page
[1008.00 → 1008.40] But I think
[1008.40 → 1009.78] Pricing was just gone
[1009.78 → 1010.80] And there was no buy now
[1010.80 → 1011.50] And there's like
[1011.50 → 1012.86] There's all these different statuses
[1012.86 → 1013.64] That you can have
[1013.64 → 1014.56] Um
[1014.56 → 1015.72] And sometimes
[1015.72 → 1016.58] They would be broken
[1016.58 → 1018.18] Also
[1018.18 → 1019.52] NCI's system
[1019.52 → 1020.66] Was imperfect
[1020.66 → 1021.82] To the point
[1021.82 → 1022.56] At least then
[1022.56 → 1023.68] Ivan
[1023.68 → 1024.24] Shut up
[1024.24 → 1027.04] To the point where
[1027.04 → 1028.82] At least back then
[1028.82 → 1030.06] There were at least
[1030.06 → 1031.26] A handful of customers
[1031.26 → 1032.16] Who
[1032.16 → 1032.84] If they
[1032.84 → 1033.78] Found out
[1033.78 → 1034.66] The skew number
[1034.66 → 1035.70] And you could
[1035.70 → 1036.50] Sort of guess
[1036.50 → 1037.98] Because you could find
[1037.98 → 1039.10] New arrivals
[1039.10 → 1040.82] By looking at new arrivals
[1040.82 → 1042.24] And then you could
[1042.24 → 1043.30] Find gaps
[1043.30 → 1044.82] In the skew numbering
[1044.82 → 1046.62] And you could
[1046.62 → 1047.68] Manually key them in
[1047.68 → 1048.56] And so people
[1048.56 → 1049.26] Found ways
[1049.26 → 1049.98] To manually
[1049.98 → 1050.82] Force the system
[1050.82 → 1051.52] To add things
[1051.52 → 1052.10] To the cart
[1052.10 → 1052.88] So those aren't
[1052.88 → 1053.74] Hidden pages
[1053.74 → 1054.52] At all
[1054.52 → 1055.52] So yeah
[1055.52 → 1056.04] In that case
[1056.04 → 1056.66] They couldn't even
[1056.66 → 1057.82] Navigate to the page
[1057.82 → 1058.68] But they could
[1058.68 → 1059.90] Force add a skew
[1059.90 → 1060.58] To the cart
[1060.58 → 1061.44] And buy it
[1061.44 → 1066.24] Oh my goodness
[1066.24 → 1066.68] That's
[1066.68 → 1066.92] Yeah
[1066.92 → 1067.64] So it's not hidden
[1067.64 → 1068.16] At all
[1068.16 → 1069.16] So it depends
[1069.16 → 1069.92] On what status
[1069.92 → 1070.20] Was being
[1070.20 → 1070.52] Anyway
[1070.52 → 1072.24] Long story short
[1072.24 → 1072.98] There are ways
[1072.98 → 1073.52] For these things
[1073.52 → 1073.88] To happen
[1073.88 → 1074.46] And there are
[1074.46 → 1075.38] Very savvy
[1075.38 → 1076.06] Customers
[1076.06 → 1077.00] Out there
[1077.00 → 1078.64] Who are trying
[1078.64 → 1079.64] Really hard
[1079.64 → 1080.30] To be like
[1080.30 → 1080.96] The one
[1080.96 → 1081.60] To leak pricing
[1081.60 → 1082.66] So there would be
[1082.66 → 1083.24] Times when we would
[1083.24 → 1083.72] Just fill in
[1083.72 → 1084.60] BS information
[1084.60 → 1085.24] I don't know
[1085.24 → 1086.20] If you still have
[1086.20 → 1086.92] This up
[1086.92 → 1087.80] Is it this page
[1087.80 → 1088.36] Yeah
[1088.36 → 1088.74] Okay
[1088.74 → 1089.80] Random little
[1089.80 → 1090.44] Side bit
[1090.44 → 1092.02] We almost made
[1092.02 → 1092.62] A video
[1092.62 → 1093.70] Here
[1093.70 → 1095.64] Media marked
[1095.64 → 1096.64] I don't think
[1096.64 → 1097.44] We actually released
[1097.44 → 1097.98] That video
[1097.98 → 1099.26] But media marked
[1099.26 → 1100.62] Is very cool
[1100.62 → 1101.30] Oh yeah
[1101.30 → 1102.26] It's a very cool
[1102.26 → 1102.64] Store
[1102.64 → 1103.66] Like you can go
[1103.66 → 1104.00] In there
[1104.00 → 1104.50] And they have
[1104.50 → 1105.56] Like an entire
[1105.56 → 1106.04] Row
[1106.04 → 1107.98] And inside the
[1107.98 → 1108.22] Row
[1108.22 → 1108.96] Like to your
[1108.96 → 1109.30] Left
[1109.30 → 1110.14] Will just be
[1110.14 → 1111.14] Like shelves
[1111.14 → 1111.78] And shelves
[1111.78 → 1112.44] Of keyboards
[1112.44 → 1113.80] With like
[1113.80 → 1114.48] A box
[1114.48 → 1115.14] Behind it
[1115.14 → 1115.66] That's probably
[1115.66 → 1116.10] Empty
[1116.10 → 1116.72] That's like
[1116.72 → 1117.34] Strapped down
[1117.34 → 1117.80] So you can see
[1117.80 → 1118.38] What it is
[1118.38 → 1119.02] Exactly what
[1119.02 → 1119.42] Model
[1119.42 → 1120.10] Exactly what
[1120.10 → 1120.52] Key switch
[1120.52 → 1120.90] All that kind
[1120.90 → 1121.22] Of stuff
[1121.22 → 1121.96] And then the
[1121.96 → 1122.38] Keyboard
[1122.38 → 1123.24] Right there
[1123.24 → 1123.94] And like
[1123.94 → 1124.68] Key pullers
[1124.68 → 1126.58] So you can
[1126.58 → 1126.94] Like look
[1126.94 → 1127.32] Under it
[1127.32 → 1127.60] See what
[1127.60 → 1127.96] The switch
[1127.96 → 1128.14] Is
[1128.14 → 1128.46] Wow
[1128.46 → 1129.02] And type
[1129.02 → 1129.26] On the
[1129.26 → 1129.50] Keyboard
[1129.50 → 1129.76] And try
[1129.76 → 1129.98] It out
[1129.98 → 1130.44] On the
[1130.44 → 1131.12] Other side
[1131.12 → 1132.26] Mice
[1132.26 → 1133.20] Down the
[1133.20 → 1133.56] Row a little
[1133.56 → 1133.80] Bit
[1133.80 → 1134.62] Headphones
[1134.62 → 1135.26] And like
[1135.26 → 1136.10] Actually a
[1136.10 → 1137.02] Huge amount
[1137.02 → 1137.40] Of each
[1137.40 → 1137.72] Type of
[1137.72 → 1138.10] Category
[1138.10 → 1139.16] And like
[1139.16 → 1139.64] Brandon was
[1139.64 → 1139.96] There with
[1139.96 → 1140.14] Me
[1140.14 → 1140.70] And they
[1140.70 → 1140.98] Had a
[1140.98 → 1141.60] Bunch
[1141.60 → 1142.12] Of cameras
[1142.12 → 1142.54] All set
[1142.54 → 1142.72] Up
[1142.72 → 1143.06] That you
[1143.06 → 1143.38] Could like
[1143.38 → 1144.10] Actually use
[1144.10 → 1144.50] With like
[1144.50 → 1145.08] Lighting stuff
[1145.08 → 1145.50] There so you
[1145.50 → 1145.82] Could actually
[1145.82 → 1146.38] Try it
[1146.38 → 1147.16] Like it's a
[1147.16 → 1147.72] Really cool
[1147.72 → 1148.06] Store
[1148.06 → 1148.90] Swedish
[1148.90 → 1150.30] Consumers
[1150.30 → 1150.98] Must be a
[1150.98 → 1151.42] Lot more
[1151.42 → 1152.02] Trustworthy
[1152.02 → 1152.44] Than north
[1152.44 → 1152.84] American
[1152.84 → 1153.28] Ones
[1153.28 → 1153.86] Media
[1153.86 → 1154.20] Marked
[1154.20 → 1155.14] I think
[1155.14 → 1155.96] Is a
[1155.96 → 1156.46] German
[1156.46 → 1156.94] Company
[1156.94 → 1157.54] But they're
[1157.54 → 1157.92] In like
[1157.92 → 1158.42] Multiple
[1158.42 → 1159.10] Countries
[1159.10 → 1159.12] Oh
[1159.12 → 1159.36] Okay
[1159.36 → 1160.26] Like we
[1160.26 → 1160.76] Saw them
[1160.76 → 1161.04] In
[1161.04 → 1161.44] Switzerland
[1161.44 → 1162.48] Right
[1162.48 → 1162.82] Okay
[1162.82 → 1164.02] Cool
[1164.02 → 1164.52] But they're
[1164.52 → 1165.08] In a
[1165.08 → 1165.34] Number
[1165.34 → 1165.56] Of
[1165.56 → 1165.84] No I
[1165.84 → 1166.06] Went
[1166.06 → 1166.40] There
[1166.40 → 1167.32] Yeah
[1167.32 → 1168.40] I went
[1168.40 → 1168.68] To one
[1168.68 → 1169.56] Because I
[1169.56 → 1169.84] Was at
[1169.84 → 1170.30] The BMW
[1170.30 → 1170.88] Shoot
[1170.88 → 1172.04] And we
[1172.04 → 1173.24] Needed a
[1173.24 → 1173.58] GoPro
[1173.58 → 1174.36] Yeah
[1174.36 → 1174.78] They're
[1174.78 → 1175.26] Pretty cool
[1175.26 → 1175.56] Yeah
[1175.56 → 1176.48] There was
[1176.48 → 1176.90] Some things
[1176.90 → 1177.20] Like they
[1177.20 → 1177.62] Only had
[1177.62 → 1178.06] Like four
[1178.06 → 1178.50] Monitors
[1178.50 → 1178.98] Or something
[1178.98 → 1179.28] And I was
[1179.28 → 1179.64] Like that's
[1179.64 → 1180.08] Kind of weird
[1180.08 → 1180.58] When you
[1180.58 → 1180.96] Have like
[1180.96 → 1181.78] Actually an
[1181.78 → 1182.18] Insane
[1182.18 → 1182.52] Amount of
[1182.52 → 1182.76] Everything
[1182.76 → 1183.02] Else
[1183.02 → 1183.50] But like
[1183.50 → 1183.98] Right
[1183.98 → 1184.30] It was a
[1184.30 → 1184.80] Cool store
[1184.80 → 1185.28] And the
[1185.28 → 1185.54] Monitors
[1185.54 → 1185.74] That they
[1185.74 → 1186.08] Did have
[1186.08 → 1186.48] They had
[1186.48 → 1187.04] Displayed
[1187.04 → 1187.40] With things
[1187.40 → 1187.86] Playing on
[1187.86 → 1188.14] Them
[1188.14 → 1189.08] Like that's
[1189.08 → 1189.38] That's
[1189.38 → 1189.82] Pretty cool

[1292.74 → 1293.94] Well
[1293.94 → 1294.54] That's neat
[1294.54 → 1295.42] I guess
[1295.42 → 1298.92] All right
[1298.92 → 1299.84] Apparently
[1299.84 → 1301.24] 45
[1301.24 → 1302.32] Vega
[1302.32 → 1302.84] Products

[1307.58 → 1308.22] That's pretty

[1308.58 → 1308.98] But they
[1308.98 → 1309.48] Had like
[1309.48 → 1310.14] AI cards
[1310.14 → 1310.58] And stuff
[1310.58 → 1310.92] So
[1310.92 → 1311.94] I don't know
[1311.94 → 1312.40] How specific
[1312.40 → 1312.84] They're getting
[1312.84 → 1313.12] There
[1313.12 → 1314.04] It could be
[1314.04 → 1314.42] Some like
[1314.42 → 1315.14] Non-consumer
[1315.14 → 1315.40] Level
[1315.40 → 1315.66] Thing
[1315.66 → 1316.08] Looks pretty
[1316.08 → 1316.74] Damn specific
[1316.74 → 1317.12] To me
[1317.12 → 1317.58] Given they've
[1317.58 → 1317.90] Got a
[1317.90 → 1318.36] Dell
[1318.36 → 1319.40] With extender
[1319.40 → 1320.04] Right
[1320.04 → 1320.26] Yeah
[1320.26 → 1320.56] And then
[1320.56 → 1321.10] Probably like
[1321.10 → 1321.40] Dell
[1321.40 → 1321.96] With no
[1321.96 → 1322.54] Extender
[1322.54 → 1322.88] Yeah
[1322.88 → 1323.62] So
[1323.62 → 1324.10] So
[1324.10 → 1324.94] It might not
[1324.94 → 1325.30] Be actually
[1325.30 → 1325.50] Much
[1325.50 → 1325.78] Changing

[1517.88 → 1518.10] Little
[1518.10 → 1518.36] Bit
[1518.36 → 1519.52] Because
[1519.52 → 1519.88] Normally
[1519.88 → 1520.02] It
[1520.02 → 1520.10] Would
[1520.10 → 1520.26] Be
[1520.26 → 1520.58] Like
[1520.58 → 1521.46] You
[1521.46 → 1521.76] Just

[1524.24 → 1524.36] One
[1524.36 → 1524.46] That

[1524.68 → 1524.80] Was
[1524.80 → 1525.04] Really
[1525.04 → 1525.40] Good
[1525.40 → 1525.84] So
[1525.84 → 1526.02] Maybe
[1526.02 → 1526.16] I'll
[1526.16 → 1526.32] Get

[1528.90 → 1529.02] Not
[1529.02 → 1529.22] Really

[1531.36 → 1531.52] Really
[1531.52 → 1531.88] Happened
[1531.88 → 1532.10] So
[1532.10 → 1532.24] I
[1532.24 → 1532.40] Guess
[1532.40 → 1532.52] It
[1532.52 → 1532.76] Doesn't
[1532.76 → 1533.06] Matter
[1533.06 → 1533.26] And

[2253.60 → 2253.94] Water
[2253.94 → 2256.56] Wow
[2256.56 → 2257.48] Yeah
[2257.48 → 2257.78] Pretty
[2257.78 → 2258.10] Brutal
[2258.10 → 2258.24] And
[2258.24 → 2258.38] If
[2258.38 → 2258.60] You
[2258.60 → 2258.84] Are
[2258.84 → 2259.10] Able
[2259.10 → 2259.32] To
[2259.32 → 2259.62] Use
[2259.62 → 2259.82] Those
[2259.82 → 2260.34] Giant
[2260.34 → 2260.90] Mechanical
[2260.90 → 2261.24] Arms
[2261.24 → 2261.48] That
[2261.48 → 2261.58] Are
[2261.58 → 2261.68] In
[2261.68 → 2261.88] Car
[2261.88 → 2262.16] Washes
[2262.16 → 2262.38] They're
[2262.38 → 2262.76] Huge
[2262.76 → 2263.28] To
[2263.28 → 2263.64] Smash
[2263.64 → 2264.04] Someone's
[2264.04 → 2264.34] Car
[2264.34 → 2265.02] If
[2265.02 → 2265.14] You
[2265.14 → 2265.30] Could
[2265.30 → 2265.62] Crack
[2265.62 → 2265.74] It
[2265.74 → 2266.00] Open
[2266.00 → 2266.54] You
[2266.54 → 2266.70] Could
[2266.70 → 2266.90] Keep
[2266.90 → 2267.06] Them
[2267.06 → 2267.20] In
[2267.20 → 2267.38] There
[2267.38 → 2267.50] And
[2267.50 → 2267.64] Just
[2267.64 → 2267.80] Like
[2267.80 → 2268.10] Flood
[2268.10 → 2268.20] Them
[2268.20 → 2268.34] With
[2268.34 → 2268.64] Water
[2268.64 → 2269.52] Right
[2269.52 → 2271.50] Do
[2271.50 → 2271.78] Super
[2271.78 → 2272.08] Bad
[2272.08 → 2272.22] And
[2272.22 → 2272.30] Then
[2272.30 → 2272.40] If
[2272.40 → 2272.50] They
[2272.50 → 2272.76] Leave
[2272.76 → 2272.90] Their
[2272.90 → 2273.12] Car
[2273.12 → 2273.26] You
[2273.26 → 2273.44] Just
[2273.44 → 2273.66] Beat
[2273.66 → 2273.84] Them
[2273.84 → 2274.02] With
[2274.02 → 2274.18] The
[2274.18 → 2274.60] Giant
[2274.60 → 2275.20] Arm
[2275.20 → 2275.58] Thing
[2275.58 → 2276.62] It's
[2276.62 → 2276.82] Actually
[2276.82 → 2277.04] Pretty
[2277.04 → 2277.34] Sketch
[2277.34 → 2277.96] Don't
[2277.96 → 2278.26] Internet
[2278.26 → 2278.52] Connect
[2278.52 → 2278.66] To

[2278.76 → 2278.96] Car
[2278.96 → 2279.24] Wash
[2279.24 → 2279.40] I
[2279.40 → 2279.70] Literally
[2279.70 → 2280.00] See
[2280.00 → 2280.46] No
[2280.46 → 2280.86] Reason
[2280.86 → 2281.10] For
[2281.10 → 2281.32] Doing
[2281.32 → 2281.56] That
[2281.56 → 2282.04] Actually

[2285.38 → 2285.56] The

[2285.86 → 2286.00] And
[2286.00 → 2286.20] Stuff
[2286.20 → 2286.40] Do
[2286.40 → 2286.58] That
[2286.58 → 2286.72] Should
[2286.72 → 2287.82] Probably
[2287.82 → 2288.14] Be
[2288.14 → 2288.74] Pre-coded
[2288.74 → 2289.18] You

[2289.56 → 2290.18] Internet
[2290.18 → 2290.48] Connect
[2290.48 → 2291.48] How
[2291.48 → 2291.82] Much

[2292.16 → 2292.32] Is

[2297.20 → 2297.32] Is

[2297.72 → 2298.38] Yeah
[2298.38 → 2298.72] I
[2298.72 → 2298.88] Mean
[2298.88 → 2299.06] It's
[2299.06 → 2299.18] A
[2299.18 → 2299.38] Fine

[2299.78 → 2300.08] Can

[2309.70 → 2310.04] That
[2310.04 → 2310.26] They
[2310.26 → 2310.56] Used
[2310.56 → 2310.70] To
[2310.70 → 2311.16] Use
[2311.16 → 2312.06] Was
[2312.06 → 2313.02] Discontinued
[2313.02 → 2313.16] By
[2313.16 → 2313.30] The
[2313.30 → 2313.96] Manufacturer
[2313.96 → 2314.18] Due
[2314.18 → 2314.34] To
[2314.34 → 2314.76] Environmental
[2314.76 → 2315.42] Regulation
[2315.42 → 2315.98] Changes
[2315.98 → 2316.52] They
[2316.52 → 2316.66] Have
[2316.66 → 2316.78] To
[2316.78 → 2316.98] Switch
[2316.98 → 2317.12] To

[2317.22 → 2317.32] New
[2317.32 → 2317.80] Detergent
[2317.80 → 2318.10] So
[2318.10 → 2318.24] They
[2318.24 → 2318.40] Have
[2318.40 → 2318.52] To
[2318.52 → 2319.04] Completely
[2319.04 → 2320.08] Retune
[2320.08 → 2320.44] All
[2320.44 → 2320.56] The
[2320.56 → 2320.82] Different
[2320.82 → 2321.26] Stages
[2321.26 → 2321.90] And
[2321.90 → 2322.64] The
[2322.64 → 2323.00] Arm
[2323.00 → 2323.36] Spinning
[2323.36 → 2323.72] Power
[2323.72 → 2324.36] And
[2324.36 → 2325.34] There
[2325.34 → 2325.42] You
[2325.42 → 2325.58] Go
[2325.58 → 2326.06] There
[2326.06 → 2326.16] There
[2326.16 → 2326.26] Is
[2326.26 → 2326.38] A
[2326.38 → 2326.72] Reason
[2326.72 → 2327.06] I
[2327.06 → 2327.48] Want
[2327.48 → 2327.54] To
[2327.54 → 2327.64] Be
[2327.64 → 2327.86] A
[2327.86 → 2328.40] Deploy
[2328.40 → 2328.68] A
[2328.68 → 2329.06] Fix
[2329.06 → 2330.56] Widely
[2330.56 → 2331.04] Quickly
[2331.04 → 2331.48] But
[2331.48 → 2331.70] That
[2331.70 → 2332.12] You
[2332.12 → 2332.14] You
[2332.14 → 2332.20] Are
[2332.20 → 2332.56] Changing
[2332.56 → 2333.14] Supply
[2333.14 → 2333.50] Lines
[2333.50 → 2333.70] For
[2333.70 → 2333.84] The
[2333.84 → 2334.32] Detergent
[2334.32 → 2334.52] You
[2334.52 → 2335.18] Have
[2335.18 → 2335.26] To
[2335.26 → 2335.38] Have
[2335.38 → 2335.60] People
[2335.60 → 2336.06] Manually
[2336.06 → 2336.44] Changing
[2336.44 → 2336.58] The
[2336.58 → 2337.04] Detergent
[2337.04 → 2337.48] I
[2337.48 → 2337.66] Feel
[2337.66 → 2337.78] Like
[2337.78 → 2337.96] Someone
[2337.96 → 2338.16] Could
[2338.16 → 2338.40] Walk
[2338.40 → 2338.52] Up
[2338.52 → 2338.66] To
[2338.66 → 2338.78] A
[2338.78 → 2339.00] Thing
[2339.00 → 2339.92] Would
[2339.92 → 2340.12] You
[2340.12 → 2340.54] Trust
[2340.54 → 2340.82] The
[2340.82 → 2341.30] Average
[2341.30 → 2341.62] Gas
[2341.62 → 2341.90] Station
[2341.90 → 2342.40] Attendant
[2342.40 → 2342.66] To
[2342.66 → 2343.18] Update
[2343.18 → 2343.36] The
[2343.36 → 2343.74] Firmware
[2343.74 → 2343.76] I
[2343.76 → 2343.92] Think
[2343.92 → 2344.06] I
[2344.06 → 2344.22] Might
[2344.22 → 2345.00] Legitimately
[2345.00 → 2345.38] Rather
[2345.38 → 2345.74] That
[2345.74 → 2346.18] Than
[2346.18 → 2346.34] An
[2346.34 → 2346.58] Internet
[2346.58 → 2346.96] Connected
[2346.96 → 2347.16] Car
[2347.16 → 2347.46] Wash
[2347.46 → 2347.78] Okay
[2347.78 → 2348.10] If
[2348.10 → 2348.24] You
[2348.24 → 2348.40] Were
[2348.40 → 2348.60] The
[2348.60 → 2349.02] Business
[2349.02 → 2349.48] Owner
[2349.48 → 2350.60] Of
[2350.60 → 2350.80] The
[2350.80 → 2351.14] Gas
[2351.14 → 2351.52] Station
[2351.52 → 2352.12] Would
[2352.12 → 2352.28] You
[2352.28 → 2352.60] Want
[2352.60 → 2352.84] That
[2352.84 → 2353.26] Person
[2353.26 → 2354.52] Potentially
[2354.52 → 2355.02] Bricking
[2355.02 → 2355.30] Your
[2355.30 → 2355.82] Expensive
[2355.82 → 2356.08] Car
[2356.08 → 2356.44] Wash
[2356.44 → 2356.86] But
[2363.70 → 2364.24] I
[2364.24 → 2364.46] Get
[2364.46 → 2364.64] It
[2364.64 → 2364.96] I
[2364.96 → 2365.16] Get
[2365.16 → 2365.46] That
[2365.46 → 2365.68] Too
[2365.68 → 2365.92] I
[2365.92 → 2366.18] I
[2366.18 → 2366.42] I
[2366.42 → 2368.26] saying that I do see both sides.
[2368.46 → 2370.60] I understand why a car wash
[2370.60 → 2372.00] might want to be connected.
[2372.54 → 2374.28] Right. At the very least,
[2374.44 → 2376.28] it should have, like,
[2376.50 → 2378.36] you have to be on its network to be able
[2378.36 → 2379.20] to do it and stuff.
[2380.06 → 2382.28] And just, like, get some better IT guys. I don't know.
[2382.68 → 2384.46] I don't know, man. Just saying.
[2385.04 → 2386.28] So Twitter is apparently
[2386.28 → 2388.38] testing an automatic tweet
[2388.38 → 2389.54] promotion service.
[2390.38 → 2392.52] So it's a $99
[2392.52 → 2394.68] monthly
[2394.68 → 2395.82] automatic
[2395.82 → 2398.18] tweet promotion thing.
[2400.26 → 2400.66] Um,
[2401.00 → 2402.44] okay. It auto-amplifies
[2402.44 → 2404.88] all your tweets and your
[2404.88 → 2405.38] profile.
[2406.96 → 2408.76] For a full 30-day period.
[2409.40 → 2410.60] That's actually smart.
[2411.04 → 2412.90] I think a lot of companies could go,
[2413.02 → 2415.08] okay, it's only $99. Yeah, I'd probably buy it.
[2415.14 → 2417.14] Everything will perform better. That makes a lot
[2417.14 → 2418.42] of sense. We should probably just buy it.
[2419.06 → 2420.94] It's not a bad idea. No need to create
[2420.94 → 2422.72] any dedicated ads. Low commitment.
[2422.88 → 2425.12] You can cancel it anytime. It's in
[2425.12 → 2426.58] beta. So they're giving participants
[2426.58 → 2428.04] the first 30 days free.
[2429.64 → 2430.52] Very interesting.
[2430.74 → 2432.60] It's actually, like, a really smart idea.
[2432.74 → 2434.76] I haven't seen a smart idea from Twitter in terms of
[2434.76 → 2436.14] monetization yet at all.
[2436.60 → 2438.74] And that's a very, that's a very good idea.
[2438.86 → 2439.30] Ouch!
[2439.30 → 2440.86] Yeah, I'm not kidding though.
[2440.86 → 2444.06] And, like, I think, I think they probably wouldn't even take that as a dig.
[2444.60 → 2448.50] Because from what they've said publicly, that seems to line up with their thinking as well.
[2448.72 → 2449.04] Huh.
[2450.10 → 2451.56] Promote your business today.
[2452.60 → 2454.50] Okay, welcome to Twitter ads.
[2454.82 → 2456.30] Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[2456.30 → 2456.78] Blah.
[2457.46 → 2458.86] I'm just curious.
[2459.06 → 2459.78] Like, is it in here?
[2459.78 → 2459.94] Yeah.
[2460.02 → 2460.74] Like, where do you go?
[2462.30 → 2463.02] Target potential customers?
[2463.02 → 2464.50] You guys can't see it right now.
[2464.62 → 2467.06] And I think that's because we don't necessarily know what's going to pop up on screen.
[2467.10 → 2468.76] Yeah, I don't have a Twitter ads account.
[2468.90 → 2470.52] So, like, this is stupid.
[2470.60 → 2473.90] Why doesn't TechCrunch's article have a link to, oh, it's a private beta.
[2474.32 → 2474.74] Ah.
[2474.74 → 2478.66] Private beta aimed at small businesses and individuals rather than big brands.
[2480.04 → 2483.30] Well, I want to try it.
[2484.18 → 2487.46] I want people to care about my tweets.
[2488.94 → 2493.34] Handle, because it knows you're logged in, and it didn't know what handle you had.
[2493.48 → 2494.40] Oh, Twitter.
[2494.78 → 2495.82] Come on, guys.
[2496.12 → 2497.16] Oh, Twitter.
[2498.04 → 2504.08] It shows his logo because he's logged in in the corner, and it's like, what handle do you use?
[2504.74 → 2505.94] I hate that.
[2505.96 → 2506.58] Oh, no, never mind.
[2506.66 → 2508.36] Technology and computing is a category.
[2508.50 → 2509.58] That is fantastic.
[2510.40 → 2510.72] Okay.
[2510.94 → 2514.92] Due to the limited nature, we cannot support other target audiences.
[2515.24 → 2515.52] Okay.
[2515.60 → 2516.30] Terms and conditions.
[2516.50 → 2517.26] I agree.
[2518.50 → 2519.54] I'm not a robot.
[2520.12 → 2521.34] And submit.
[2522.16 → 2522.58] Okay.
[2522.82 → 2524.18] So we're applying right now?
[2524.50 → 2525.94] This is a closed beta program.
[2525.94 → 2530.88] Please be sure to make the information match your handle on your invitation if you're not part of the initial invite list.
[2531.00 → 2531.90] We have recorded your application.
[2532.02 → 2533.50] We'll follow up if we open the beta.
[2533.96 → 2534.28] Cool.
[2534.28 → 2534.78] All right.
[2535.14 → 2537.82] Well, I want to give Twitter my money.
[2538.26 → 2539.62] I don't really, but we'll see.
[2540.30 → 2545.32] Apparently, Twitter added a total of zero new users last quarter.
[2547.54 → 2549.10] Like, I'm thinking net.
[2549.72 → 2550.16] Yeah.
[2551.00 → 2552.42] Isn't that terrifying?
[2553.34 → 2557.36] If your whole value of your company is your user base.
[2557.44 → 2559.96] But then, like, how do you add new users as Twitter?
[2559.96 → 2564.04] The company is the I don't remember what his handle is, the real Donald Trump or whatever.
[2564.54 → 2569.04] I was looking through handles recently, and I typed at, and the first thing that came up was that.
[2569.28 → 2571.12] And I promise you, I've never been to that account.
[2571.72 → 2573.04] I'm not even just saying that about him.
[2573.04 → 2575.96] I don't go to political people's Twitter accounts because I don't care.
[2578.38 → 2578.78] Wow.
[2579.46 → 2579.90] Yeah.
[2579.90 → 2582.24] All right, then.
[2582.94 → 2583.94] Now, yeah, we will.
[2584.16 → 2588.10] Now, you can buy solar energy from your neighbour on a blockchain.
[2588.10 → 2592.92] I don't really have much else to say about that.
[2593.28 → 2600.02] It's a New York-based startup, and they want to help electricity users buy energy from their energy-producing neighbours using smart meters and an app.
[2600.60 → 2603.78] That seems like a niche within a niche within a niche, and that's great.
[2603.78 → 2612.94] There's also mention of megawatts, where you're paid to turn your water heater and other energy drains off.
[2615.34 → 2619.54] I don't know why you'd be paid for that.
[2619.88 → 2625.32] I'm assuming because you'd be able to sell more to your neighbours, but I don't, I'm not really sure.
[2626.28 → 2628.26] This is pretty fascinating.
[2628.26 → 2633.86] So, tax evaders must now fear Instagram.
[2634.80 → 2636.00] In India, anyway.
[2636.58 → 2637.24] Check this out.
[2637.36 → 2642.96] Holiday posts on Instagram tipping off India's tax collectors.
[2643.88 → 2654.40] So, a photo of your shiny new car or Facebook post about your chic holiday cottage may cause you to get audited.
[2654.72 → 2658.00] I mean, it was a matter of time before this was going to happen.
[2658.26 → 2669.68] But India's government will begin amassing a warehouse of virtual information starting next month, collected not just from traditional sources like banks, but also social media sites.
[2670.16 → 2675.20] They'll be looking to match resident spending patterns with their income declarations.
[2675.62 → 2683.02] So, they'll be able to spot those who pay too little tax without, like, raiding their homes the way that they do now.
[2684.54 → 2686.52] Very interesting.
[2686.52 → 2696.24] So, in 2016, only 37 million of India's 1.3 billion people filed tax returns.
[2697.04 → 2697.60] Wow.
[2697.64 → 2699.82] That's somewhere in the neighbourhood of 37%.
[2699.82 → 2702.62] Wait, what?
[2703.44 → 2703.86] That's right.
[2703.94 → 2704.74] 3%.
[2704.74 → 2705.50] 3%.
[2705.50 → 2716.06] So, India's efforts are similar to the UK's Connect, which is estimated to have cost about 100 million pounds, but prevented the loss of 5.4 billion in revenue.
[2716.86 → 2719.56] And apparently the number of criminal prosecutions has risen.
[2720.26 → 2720.76] Wow.
[2720.88 → 2721.78] That's incredible.
[2722.90 → 2727.34] By, like, 700% from 165 a year to 1165.
[2729.54 → 2729.98] Unbelievable.
[2730.28 → 2730.44] Me?
[2730.44 → 2736.98] Amazon launches parcel delivery lockers for apartment buildings.
[2737.42 → 2739.84] So, yeah, it's kind of boring.
[2739.84 → 2745.94] Apparently, YouTube Red and Google Play Music are going to merge to create a new service.
[2746.06 → 2752.34] The original article here is from The Verge, and they've confirmed that it'll be one service to cover everything.
[2752.48 → 2752.82] Almost.
[2752.82 → 2762.48] I mean, I don't really understand what the real difference is, other than branding here, because they were already including Google Play Music with YouTube Red.
[2762.68 → 2770.90] I am super stoked to hope that my Google Play Music account will now include YouTube Red, but I'm not sure about that.
[2771.16 → 2776.28] But they basically said they needed to merge the two services to help educate consumers and bring in new subscribers.
[2776.28 → 2781.72] Right now, it's just kind of unnecessarily complicated.
[2781.84 → 2787.62] So, there's YouTube Red, which removes ads from videos and lets you save them offline, while also giving you access to Google Play Music for free.
[2788.00 → 2792.74] Then there's YouTube Music, which anyone can use, but gets better if you're signed up for YouTube Red.
[2793.08 → 2796.68] And then YouTube TV is an entirely separate thing, but not available everywhere yet.
[2796.68 → 2802.56] So, they're combining the teams working on the two streaming services, or rather, they combined them earlier this year.
[2804.62 → 2812.58] I guess, really, the last thing left on the show today is a look at what's going on over on Flow Playing Club.
[2812.84 → 2813.02] Woo!
[2815.50 → 2820.18] I guess I could also do, like, a teaser for LTX.
[2820.28 → 2824.56] So, one thing that's not going to be at LTX, after all, is the arcade machine.
[2824.56 → 2836.68] Anthony has been away on a personal matter this week, and he was the one who was going to kind of get all the little things that weren't quite done about it tidied up and get it transported there.
[2836.76 → 2838.94] And it looks like we're not going to be able to get that done.
[2839.50 → 2841.74] But we are still going to have a bunch of cool stuff there.
[2842.06 → 2844.24] 16K Gaming is still going to be there.
[2846.40 → 2851.74] And on that subject, I guess we can have a look at what's over on Flow Playing.
[2851.74 → 2856.14] So, the crappiest SLI setup of all time.
[2856.34 → 2859.04] It's a pretty fun video that went up on Wednesday.
[2860.56 → 2865.70] The conclusion of gaming at 16K resolution is up.
[2866.18 → 2871.60] So, if you guys are going to want to binge-watch some LTT, that'll be included in there.
[2871.60 → 2874.66] The how we make our videos video.
[2874.84 → 2875.02] Wait.
[2875.88 → 2876.10] Oh.
[2876.66 → 2878.02] People must have just commented on it.
[2878.02 → 2881.82] We really need a better, like, sort by original post.
[2882.14 → 2882.80] Can you do that?
[2883.50 → 2884.08] Sort by.
[2884.08 → 2884.50] Sort by.
[2884.84 → 2885.24] Oh, yeah.
[2885.30 → 2885.76] Look at that.
[2887.22 → 2887.64] Wait.
[2887.74 → 2887.92] What?
[2888.04 → 2889.04] It's currently on that.
[2889.18 → 2889.46] Oh.
[2890.02 → 2890.42] Okay.
[2890.60 → 2891.24] Way to go, noob.
[2892.30 → 2892.72] All right.
[2893.22 → 2896.46] We tried Apple's Forgotten Game Console from 1996.
[2896.76 → 2897.74] This was a really fun one.
[2897.76 → 2898.80] That was so much fun.
[2899.06 → 2899.22] Yeah.
[2899.22 → 2901.38] Intel stock cooler on steroids.
[2902.68 → 2904.76] There's, like, a raided out version of the like, stock cooler.
[2904.76 → 2905.14] Whoa.
[2905.16 → 2905.56] Really?
[2905.82 → 2906.04] Yeah.
[2906.64 → 2907.40] That's cool.
[2907.64 → 2907.88] Yeah.
[2909.34 → 2910.22] That's interesting.
[2911.04 → 2911.96] Logitech G Power Play.
[2912.04 → 2913.16] That was a simultaneous release.
[2913.30 → 2914.78] Ultimate Sleeper PC build.
[2915.22 → 2916.50] Oh, I'm excited to see that, actually.
[2916.66 → 2917.70] You haven't watched this?
[2917.72 → 2918.60] I've seen the intro.
[2918.76 → 2919.90] The intro is fantastic.
[2919.90 → 2923.30] You're too busy developing the site to actually use the site.
[2923.50 → 2925.84] Too busy calling people and doing weird business-y stuff.
[2925.96 → 2926.62] Way to go.
[2926.72 → 2927.40] Channel Super Fun.
[2927.52 → 2928.12] Way to go.
[2928.12 → 2929.28] Channel Super Fun.
[2929.36 → 2929.58] Oh, yeah.
[2929.64 → 2930.78] Inside Cutlery Investigation.
[2930.86 → 2931.64] Channel Super Fun.
[2931.86 → 2932.02] Yeah.
[2932.16 → 2932.42] Okay.
[2932.70 → 2934.72] So we found out who was stealing the cutlery.
[2934.82 → 2936.72] Also, Colton is pretending he's a cop.
[2936.92 → 2937.92] People liked this, man.
[2938.06 → 2938.24] Yeah.
[2938.30 → 2938.56] I know.
[2938.64 → 2939.76] It was actually a pretty funny video.
[2939.98 → 2940.18] Really well.
[2940.32 → 2940.46] Yeah.
[2940.80 → 2941.70] Good job, Colton.
[2942.02 → 2942.70] Hey, thanks, guys.
[2943.46 → 2945.74] I won't spoil it, but the ending is pretty epic.
[2946.12 → 2947.28] I also haven't seen that.
[2947.54 → 2948.66] The ending is pretty epic.
[2948.68 → 2949.74] I've been wanting to watch it, though.
[2949.74 → 2952.44] There's actually another video that's going to be going up very shortly.
[2952.58 → 2955.66] We've got another warehouse construction update.
[2955.96 → 2956.40] Oh, cool.
[2956.48 → 2956.54] Yeah.
[2956.54 → 2957.46] Have you been up there recently?
[2957.46 → 2957.98] Yes.
[2958.74 → 2960.44] This actually looks really nice.
[2960.54 → 2960.80] Yeah.
[2960.96 → 2961.74] I'm pretty excited.
[2961.88 → 2963.42] I'm, like, super excited.
[2963.90 → 2968.90] I'm stoked that even though my office is moving a lot, I'm, like, pretty much equidistant
[2968.90 → 2969.48] from the kitchen.
[2970.20 → 2970.64] Yeah.
[2971.76 → 2972.20] Actually.
[2972.40 → 2973.46] And there are two kitchens now.
[2973.74 → 2974.06] Well, no.
[2974.12 → 2974.64] That's what I'm saying.
[2974.66 → 2975.52] Oh, from the new kitchen.
[2975.54 → 2975.76] Yes.
[2976.26 → 2980.20] And you are going to be the closest person in the building to the shower.
[2980.70 → 2981.42] Oh, it's upstairs.
[2982.00 → 2982.36] Yeah.
[2982.76 → 2983.10] Yes.
[2983.10 → 2983.58] Yeah.
[2983.66 → 2985.72] The bathroom in the corner there is the one with the shower.
[2985.72 → 2986.36] That's actually awesome.
[2986.50 → 2987.94] I'm going to, yeah, anyway.
[2988.22 → 2988.36] Yeah.
[2988.92 → 2990.04] I'm probably going to start doing, like, sport lunch times.
[2990.04 → 2991.50] I'm going to shower so much.
[2991.78 → 2993.32] Well, I might start doing sport lunch times.
[2993.38 → 2993.88] Sport lunch.
[2993.96 → 2994.50] Very nice.
[2994.72 → 2994.84] Yeah.
[2994.84 → 2994.92] Yeah.
[2994.92 → 2996.46] All right.
[2996.56 → 2997.82] So, did you have anything else?
[2999.54 → 3006.72] There's a minor issue with one of the booths, and I have the solution at my home because
[3006.72 → 3009.34] I collect things, so I will solve the problem.
[3009.62 → 3010.78] It wasn't ours.
[3010.94 → 3011.82] It wasn't our problem.
[3011.90 → 3012.20] Okay.
[3012.44 → 3012.62] Yeah.
[3012.86 → 3017.04] There's a minor issue with one of my things that I'm not sure.
[3018.60 → 3019.82] Is that the thing I was working on?
[3020.64 → 3021.04] Oh.
[3021.36 → 3022.26] Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[3022.26 → 3022.90] Should we show that?
[3022.90 → 3026.22] There was a minor issue with that, which will also be at LTX.
[3026.44 → 3028.14] Oh, you can only see the side of it, really.
[3028.24 → 3029.12] Do you guys want to lift it up?
[3030.84 → 3032.42] We should, but don't move too close.
[3032.54 → 3033.20] Like, keep it blurry.
[3033.30 → 3036.00] Keep it blurry because you're going to have to be at LTX if you want to.
[3036.84 → 3037.62] You guys got it?
[3037.86 → 3038.08] Nope.
[3038.68 → 3039.28] And twist.
[3042.76 → 3045.00] Oh, so that's going to be a pretty interesting build log.
[3045.08 → 3046.10] Don't, don't, don't look too much.
[3046.16 → 3046.80] Don't look too much.
[3046.86 → 3047.46] Don't look too much.
[3047.50 → 3047.74] Okay.
[3047.86 → 3050.28] So, that'll be at LTX, and the video will be coming soon.
[3051.28 → 3051.60] Yeah.
[3051.60 → 3053.60] So, it's going to be a cool show.
[3053.70 → 3055.16] I'm actually super stoked.
[3055.32 → 3061.28] I really hope I get one of my demos that is like, you know, no offence to anyone else and
[3061.28 → 3065.12] everything they're doing, but will actually be the most exciting thing at the show.
[3066.22 → 3068.20] It's straight up not working right now.
[3068.20 → 3072.34] So, I've got 15 hours.
[3072.76 → 3073.10] Nice.
[3073.60 → 3081.96] If, if it doesn't work, will you take each half and show them?
[3082.64 → 3083.42] I don't know.
[3084.56 → 3085.78] Let's keep it mysterious.
[3086.24 → 3086.84] Oh my.
[3087.38 → 3088.54] So, thanks for watching, guys.
[3088.54 → 3088.56] Mysterious, yes.
[3088.56 → 3090.26] We will see you again next week.
[3090.34 → 3092.62] Same bat time, same bat channel.
[3092.72 → 3095.26] If you haven't already, go sign up for Float plane Club.
[3095.60 → 3095.88] Yes.
[3096.26 → 3097.84] Copy link address.
[3097.94 → 3099.52] I'm going to post that in the Twitch chat.
[3100.44 → 3102.12] And, yeah.
[3102.66 → 3104.82] We will see you guys at LTX if you're going to be there.
[3105.64 → 3106.30] Float plane, yes.
[3106.40 → 3107.16] LTX, yes.
[3107.66 → 3108.22] Heck, yeah.
[3109.30 → 3109.68] Okay.
[3109.98 → 3110.52] Here we go.
[3111.36 → 3111.80] Where is it?
[3111.94 → 3112.32] There it is.
[3112.32 → 3121.62] Everyone's flipping out about the like, teaser.
[3122.08 → 3122.30] Yeah.
[3124.02 → 3124.90] I'm sorry, guys.
[3124.94 → 3125.84] There's nothing I can do.
[3128.80 → 3129.62] And no.
[3130.24 → 3131.28] After party, yes.
[3133.38 → 3134.10] Sorry, guys.
[3134.16 → 3135.60] I don't think we're doing an after party today.
[3135.68 → 3137.88] We've got a lot of planning to deal with for tomorrow.
[3138.18 → 3139.92] Like, no one's, no one's going home right now,
[3139.98 → 3142.04] but we can't, uh, we can't keep streaming.
[3142.32 → 3145.08] I will have my thing, but it's going to be late.
[3145.60 → 3145.82] Yeah.
[3145.90 → 3146.86] So, there you go.
[3146.98 → 3151.16] Don't expect any time frame for that that makes any sense at all.
[3151.98 → 3152.62] There we go.
[3152.62 → 3152.64] There we go.
