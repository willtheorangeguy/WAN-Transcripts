• The speaker believes that 4K resolution may not be a significant selling point for TVs due to the limited availability of high-quality 4K content.
• High Dynamic Range (HDR) technology is also a tough sell, as its benefits are often masked by poor mastering or lackluster visuals when watched without comparison.
• The industry needs to find ways to drive up Average Selling Prices (ASPs) and move beyond being seen as commodity devices.
• One potential solution is to create gaming displays that showcase the capabilities of new technologies.
• Wide color gamut and HDR (High Dynamic Range) capabilities in displays
