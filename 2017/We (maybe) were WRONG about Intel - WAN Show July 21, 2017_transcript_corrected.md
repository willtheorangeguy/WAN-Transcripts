[0.00 → 6.96] Because like all the way over I still don't really fit. That's what she said. Yeah, it's We'd show time, and we managed to get a
[6.96 → 13.00] That's what she said before the proper intro. Before the intro. Right at the start. We are fast
[13.60 → 19.84] Like that. You're just like that you are thinking you're thinking oh, it's about just and it's over. Yeah
[22.00 → 25.22] Okay, we've got a great show for you guys today record speed
[25.22 → 29.86] um first we get to admit that we were not only
[30.74 → 33.06] slightly wrong but also
[33.84 → 41.68] Slightly ignorant and a little bit dumb so that'll be coming later. Okay, which I wasn't able to research at all
[44.16 → 48.58] Because I can't look at this yeah, yeah, no, that's that's fine. Don't worry. I got this thanks
[50.10 → 53.16] HTC's keyboard is showing ads
[53.16 → 59.88] to users of their phones apparently it might not really be their fault, but it's because of something whatever we're gonna
[59.88 → 68.74] Do later so that's brilliant this just in an Asus thread ripper motherboard there are now unboxing pictures. It looks awesome
[69.34 → 77.08] I've held it. Oh, it feels awesome. I'm sure it does and the DOG crosshair six extreme has been
[77.68 → 78.68] announced
[78.68 → 80.68] dun dun dun
[80.68 → 82.68] uh
[82.68 → 84.68] So yeah, I guess really a job
[84.68 → 86.68] really a job
[88.28 → 92.90] Dang it. I don't have twitch open yet nerd neither do I damn it
[96.54 → 100.14] I believe that is pretty much the definition of a wrecked son
[102.66 → 104.66] I got it
[104.66 → 106.66] Hold on
[106.66 → 112.54] I'm sure we had sponsors, but I have to post that the land show is live on social media
[112.54 → 114.54] That's what I usually do well
[114.54 → 116.54] Thank you to savage turkey
[116.54 → 118.54] Fresh books
[118.54 → 120.54] Fresh books
[120.54 → 122.54] Mack Weldon
[122.54 → 124.54] Mack Weldon
[124.54 → 126.54] I'm from go tech tips
[126.54 → 128.54] jingles
[128.54 → 130.54] jingles are a lost art we should uh we should make another album
[130.54 → 132.54] Oh
[132.54 → 135.54] Okay, I've wanted to do a non Christmas themed album for a while
[135.54 → 139.54] I know, but I didn't we learn our lesson last time?
[139.54 → 141.54] No, it did really well
[141.54 → 143.54] Okay, well there are different ways to learn your lesson
[143.54 → 146.54] Okay, so for those of you not familiar
[146.54 → 149.54] It must have how it was over a year and a half ago
[149.54 → 151.54] That's a long time ago
[151.54 → 156.54] Over a year and a half ago we had the harebrained idea
[156.54 → 159.54] I don't remember whose idea it was
[159.54 → 160.54] Was it you?
[160.54 → 161.54] Was it me?
[161.54 → 162.54] I think it was you
[162.54 → 163.54] Was it me?
[163.54 → 164.54] I'm not taking full credit for it
[164.54 → 165.54] I'll take partial credit for it
[165.54 → 167.54] Other people were complicit in this
[167.54 → 168.54] I was more than complicit
[168.54 → 169.54] I was yeah
[169.54 → 173.54] So this was a thing that we as a team created
[173.54 → 175.54] I don't think it was my idea, but I definitely championed
[175.54 → 176.54] Yeah
[176.54 → 178.54] Okay, so we created a Christmas album
[178.54 → 180.54] We took a bunch of classic Christmas songs
[180.54 → 186.54] And we rewrote the lyrics with technology as sort of theme
[186.54 → 190.54] And it was awful
[190.54 → 191.54] Yeah
[191.54 → 194.54] Like the lyrics were actually not as bad as you might expect
[194.54 → 198.54] Because I took what some other people wrote
[198.54 → 202.54] And made very few alterations because they were quite good
[202.54 → 206.54] Or completely redid because they were done by Colton
[206.54 → 207.54] Yeah, yeah
[207.54 → 211.54] John and I sat down like together outside of work hours
[211.54 → 214.54] And wrote a few songs that were like pretty solid
[214.54 → 217.54] Yeah, I believe Nick's Nick Lights were pretty good
[217.54 → 218.54] Nick did a few
[218.54 → 220.54] Yep, Colton's were terrible
[220.54 → 221.54] They were terrible
[221.54 → 224.54] I was like do you even English bro
[224.54 → 225.54] They were a little rough
[225.54 → 226.54] So I redid those
[226.54 → 227.54] But anyway
[227.54 → 230.54] And then without any rehearsals
[230.54 → 231.54] Nacho Mist
[231.54 → 234.54] Which like that's a reputable name right there
[234.54 → 236.54] Says that it was actually fantastic
[236.54 → 238.54] Okay, thanks Nacho Mist
[238.54 → 240.54] And we actually sold quite a few of them
[240.54 → 243.54] So I was getting to that part
[243.54 → 245.54] Are you checking?
[245.54 → 246.54] Which I'm gonna check right now
[246.54 → 247.54] You're checking aren't you?
[247.54 → 249.54] Which might mean that we're going to sell none of them next time
[249.54 → 251.54] Yeah, because people have now seen what we can do
[251.54 → 253.54] Yeah, so anyway
[253.54 → 255.54] So we did, I think it was like 9 or 10 songs
[255.54 → 256.54] Something like that
[256.54 → 258.54] So we, without any rehearsals
[258.54 → 260.54] And without any screening
[260.54 → 262.54] So no matter who they were
[262.54 → 264.54] If they were on staff at Linus Media Group
[264.54 → 267.54] They had to sing for the Christmas album
[267.54 → 271.54] And we sold, how many of them did we sell?
[271.54 → 272.54] We sold 924
[272.54 → 276.54] For a grand total of $2,772
[276.54 → 281.54] So we, not even close to made back the time we spent on it
[281.54 → 282.54] Nope
[282.54 → 283.54] Not even close
[283.54 → 284.54] But there's also ad revenue
[286.54 → 288.54] Which I can look up for you right now
[288.54 → 290.54] Oh, I don't know if we can say it
[290.54 → 292.54] Sure, yeah, let's, let's
[292.54 → 293.54] I don't think anyone's gonna care
[293.54 → 294.54] Okay
[294.54 → 295.54] You know what?
[295.54 → 297.54] We may have actually turned off
[297.54 → 300.54] Monetization on this?
[300.54 → 301.54] We may have turned off monetization
[301.54 → 303.54] Because we wanted as many people as possible
[303.54 → 307.54] To watch the, the video advertising it
[307.54 → 309.54] So we released it as something that
[309.54 → 311.54] Almost looked like a joke
[311.54 → 313.54] No we did, we monetized it
[313.54 → 316.54] So we released this video that almost looked like a joke
[316.54 → 318.54] And, um
[318.54 → 320.54] And then were way too serious about it
[320.54 → 322.54] And then you actually could buy it
[322.54 → 324.54] Um
[324.54 → 327.54] Like, this is, this is real
[327.54 → 328.54] This is not a joke
[328.54 → 330.54] At all
[330.54 → 331.54] Um
[331.54 → 336.54] Look at Ed back there
[339.54 → 340.54] Nick's like into it
[346.54 → 349.54] My favourite thing this whole time is looking at Colton's face
[350.54 → 352.54] Cause this, if you see like the behind the scenes
[352.54 → 354.54] Linus has just been grilling Colton the whole time
[354.54 → 356.54] So Colton's just sitting on the couch
[356.54 → 358.54] I don't even think he's singing like half the time
[358.54 → 360.54] I'm just completely deadpan
[360.54 → 361.54] It's great
[361.54 → 362.54] Another interesting thing
[362.54 → 364.54] The reason why I know that this sold fairly well
[364.54 → 368.54] Is that I get emailed every single time someone buys it
[370.54 → 371.54] Every time
[371.54 → 372.54] So like every few months
[372.54 → 373.54] It's not that common anymore
[373.54 → 374.54] Because it's been so long right?
[374.54 → 375.54] Yeah
[375.54 → 377.54] But someone will see this in the downloads section
[377.54 → 378.54] And just be like, what?
[378.54 → 380.54] And just buy it for fun?
[380.54 → 382.54] So we brought in another $400
[382.54 → 383.54] Heck yeah
[383.54 → 386.54] From the 275,000 views on that video
[386.54 → 388.54] So that's over $3,000, man
[388.54 → 391.54] So that makes you want to do another one
[391.54 → 392.54] And that was
[392.54 → 394.54] Well that was back in 2015
[394.54 → 396.54] We probably get more views now
[396.54 → 397.54] Okay
[397.54 → 398.54] So tell you what
[398.54 → 400.54] We've matured as a professional
[400.54 → 401.54] I'm gonna
[401.54 → 402.54] Oh shut up
[402.54 → 403.54] I'm gonna
[405.54 → 406.54] I'm going
[406.54 → 408.54] I'm going full on
[408.54 → 410.54] Bean Spiller here
[410.54 → 413.54] We are not doing another album
[413.54 → 415.54] Like in that form
[415.54 → 416.54] Oh
[416.54 → 417.54] You don't want to
[417.54 → 418.54] You don't want to spill it?
[418.54 → 419.54] I'm not going to tell
[419.54 → 421.54] No, no, I want to make another album
[421.54 → 422.54] No, no, we're not doing another album
[422.54 → 423.54] Alright
[423.54 → 424.54] But
[424.54 → 425.54] There will be
[425.54 → 426.54] Sometime in
[426.54 → 428.54] I'm not going to promise a timeframe
[428.54 → 429.54] Other than like in the next few months
[429.54 → 431.54] Because it's a fairly large project
[431.54 → 432.54] And we want to do it right
[432.54 → 435.54] There will be a tech themed
[435.54 → 438.54] Like fairly high production value
[439.54 → 441.54] Music video
[441.54 → 443.54] Coming from Linus Tech Tips
[443.54 → 444.54] In that timeframe
[444.54 → 446.54] Which is it does well enough
[446.54 → 448.54] Might end up being able to go into an album
[448.54 → 449.54] If we do enough of them
[449.54 → 451.54] Okay, have you heard the song?
[451.54 → 452.54] No
[452.54 → 453.54] There's a song
[453.54 → 454.54] It's recorded already?
[454.54 → 456.54] The actual melody
[456.54 → 457.54] Oh, okay
[457.54 → 458.54] No, I haven't heard it yet
[458.54 → 459.54] Exists already
[459.54 → 460.54] I haven't heard it yet
[460.54 → 461.54] With some placeholder lyrics
[461.54 → 462.54] Very placeholder
[462.54 → 463.54] But like
[463.54 → 465.54] It's pretty catchy
[465.54 → 466.54] I haven't heard it
[466.54 → 467.54] It's pretty catchy
[467.54 → 468.54] Is this?
[468.54 → 469.54] You bet
[469.54 → 470.54] Okay, awesome
[470.54 → 471.54] Yeah, so it's
[471.54 → 472.54] This is something
[472.54 → 473.54] That
[473.54 → 474.54] That
[474.54 → 475.54] That we've been talking about
[475.54 → 477.54] Actually for probably about three years
[478.54 → 480.54] Well before the Christmas album
[480.54 → 482.54] Well before we were in this office
[482.54 → 483.54] Yeah
[483.54 → 484.54] So that's
[484.54 → 486.54] That's definitely a thing that's happening
[486.54 → 487.54] Um
[487.54 → 489.54] Other things that are happening
[489.54 → 492.54] So the 16k gaming setup
[492.54 → 496.54] I hope I'm not really spoiling anything
[496.54 → 498.54] But I just came back
[498.54 → 500.54] From filming the final video
[500.54 → 501.54] For that
[501.54 → 502.54] So uh
[502.54 → 503.54] That's
[503.54 → 504.54] That's coming very soon as well
[504.54 → 505.54] That's awesome
[505.54 → 507.54] And no it is not a baby parody
[507.54 → 508.54] As much as I would love to do that
[508.54 → 509.54] A baby parody?
[509.54 → 510.54] Baby
[510.54 → 511.54] Baby
[511.54 → 512.54] Baby
[512.54 → 513.54] Aww
[513.54 → 514.54] Yeah, no
[514.54 → 515.54] It's not that
[515.54 → 516.54] Alright
[516.54 → 518.54] So
[518.54 → 519.54] I
[519.54 → 521.54] Don't know what just happened there
[521.54 → 522.54] I don't know
[522.54 → 523.54] I don't know
[523.54 → 524.54] Wow, I don't know what this
[524.54 → 525.54] I don't know what this is
[525.54 → 526.54] But
[526.54 → 528.54] Actually where this conversation took place
[528.54 → 529.54] Was on my personal Twitter
[529.54 → 532.54] So the only way I'm going to be able to
[532.54 → 533.54] Um
[533.54 → 534.54] The only way up
[534.54 → 535.54] The only way up
[535.54 → 536.54] So
[536.54 → 537.54] Let's kick the show-off
[537.54 → 539.54] With me kind of
[539.54 → 541.54] Admitting that I may have made
[541.54 → 543.54] A bit of a mistake
[543.54 → 544.54] So first
[544.54 → 545.54] There was the news from Tech Power Up
[545.54 → 546.54] From last week
[546.54 → 547.54] Intel says
[547.54 → 550.54] AMD EPIC processors glued together
[550.54 → 552.54] In official slide deck
[552.54 → 553.54] And to be clear
[553.54 → 557.54] That was far from the only thing wrong with this slide deck
[557.54 → 566.54] We went kind of ham on Intel slide deck being unprofessional, childish, undignified, you pretty much name it
[566.54 → 567.54] And
[567.54 → 570.54] I'm not backpedalling on the bulk of that
[570.54 → 571.54] But
[571.54 → 572.54] Um
[572.54 → 575.54] There's also a post on the forum here
[575.54 → 576.54] This is
[576.54 → 578.54] This was posted by
[578.54 → 579.54] Uh
[579.54 → 580.54] Johnny
[580.54 → 582.54] Johnny Corporal Tech
[582.54 → 583.54] And
[583.54 → 586.54] AMD basically produced a couple slides going like
[586.54 → 588.54] Actually, okay, you know, we have some partners
[588.54 → 590.54] Their partner list isn't as long
[590.54 → 592.54] But at least it doesn't have any duplicate entries on it
[592.54 → 593.54] So we've got to give them credit for that
[593.54 → 595.54] And the partners that they do list are a pretty big deal
[595.54 → 596.54] Yep
[596.54 → 598.54] But
[598.54 → 601.54] There was something that I did kind of screw up
[601.54 → 606.54] Because I was not familiar with this particular technical term
[606.54 → 607.54] So
[607.54 → 608.54] Dr. Curtis
[608.54 → 609.54] From
[609.54 → 610.54] Nantes
[610.54 → 612.54] Made a point
[612.54 → 614.54] I can't believe he watches the WAN show
[614.54 → 615.54] I don't know why he would
[615.54 → 616.54] Um
[616.54 → 617.54] I like that, thank you
[617.54 → 618.54] Yeah, thanks Ian, hi
[618.54 → 619.54] Uh
[619.54 → 620.54] Made a point of messaging me
[620.54 → 621.54] Via DM
[621.54 → 622.54] FYI
[623.54 → 624.54] He's so polite
[624.54 → 625.54] Was it? Okay
[625.54 → 626.54] He's so British
[626.54 → 627.54] Is it accurate though?
[627.54 → 628.54] Uh
[628.54 → 629.54] If Ian says so, I'm kind of going
[629.54 → 630.54] Going with it
[630.54 → 631.54] Did he say it's accurate?
[631.54 → 632.54] So here's what he said
[632.54 → 634.54] Is it being a term is different from it being accurate?
[634.54 → 635.54] Here's what he said word for word
[635.54 → 637.54] FYI
[637.54 → 639.54] Glued together is a technical term
[639.54 → 640.54] Okay
[640.54 → 644.54] Infinity fabric is a glue logic fabric
[644.54 → 645.54] Okay
[645.54 → 646.54] Okay
[646.54 → 649.54] And a common semiconductor micro architecture term
[649.54 → 654.54] And he linked me to a Wikipedia article because while he is a very polite person
[654.54 → 655.54] He's British
[655.54 → 657.54] That doesn't mean he can't get a little snarky
[657.54 → 658.54] He's British
[659.54 → 665.54] You'll see it in a lot of semiconductor research papers to deal with data movement around silicon or between chips
[665.54 → 670.54] Examples include PCI Express, Envy Link, etc. In case you were unaware
[670.54 → 671.54] I feel like it was
[671.54 → 672.54] I feel like it was
[672.54 → 673.54] And thanks for the shout-out
[673.54 → 675.54] I feel like it was being used
[675.54 → 683.54] I feel like the way they were using it in the context of all the other slides was still pretty B mode
[683.54 → 684.54] Yeah
[684.54 → 690.54] And it can be a technical term and that actually makes sense that it's a'm not surprised at all
[690.54 → 696.54] I thought it was incorrect because I thought their form of link wasn't applicable to that
[696.54 → 697.54] Yeah
[697.54 → 698.54] But I think it's still BS
[698.54 → 700.54] But there you go
[700.54 → 708.54] So I'm backpedalling on the outrage over saying that Epic is glued together
[708.54 → 714.54] You heard it here first, but I'm not backpedalling over the rest of the nonsense that was in that slide deck
[714.54 → 717.54] I'm still a little bit for the outrage on that comment
[717.54 → 722.54] It was structured in a very angry aggressive way
[722.54 → 724.54] I don't know
[724.54 → 727.54] Alright, speaking of outrage
[727.54 → 729.54] HTC's keyboard
[729.54 → 730.54] Yeah
[730.54 → 733.54] Is showing ads to its users
[733.54 → 734.54] I mean
[734.54 → 736.54] Oh, okay, okay, here we go
[736.54 → 739.54] HTC is working on a fix
[739.54 → 740.54] So what's the update?
[740.54 → 742.54] I love it when they use the term fix
[742.54 → 745.54] To describe something that wasn't broken
[745.54 → 753.54] Okay, to be fair for this situation touch pal is the keyboard and HTC uses touch pal keyboard
[753.54 → 759.54] So what HTC thinks is or what people think is going on here is that touch pal?
[759.54 → 765.54] Ran an update that started serving ads through the keyboard and HTC was like whoa what the heck?
[765.54 → 768.54] And is now trying to stop this from happening
[768.54 → 772.54] So I don't think it was like HTC actively doing anything
[772.54 → 776.54] I just think it was HTC losing control of something that they use
[776.54 → 778.54] Here's what I don't understand
[778.54 → 780.54] Why are they using touch pal keyboard?
[780.54 → 782.54] I don't know
[782.54 → 784.54] I don't know
[784.54 → 785.54] I don't know
[785.54 → 786.54] I can't
[786.54 → 788.54] That part has continued to be confusing for me
[789.54 → 791.54] Swift Key's free?
[791.54 → 792.54] Yup
[792.54 → 797.54] Well, Swift Key might be free in the context of an end user downloading it
[797.54 → 802.54] But Swift Key might not be free to a skin maker wanting to
[803.54 → 805.54] But Google Keyboard is free
[805.54 → 807.54] Google Keyboard is fine, and it's free
[807.54 → 808.54] Like it's not my favourite
[808.54 → 809.54] I don't use it
[809.54 → 810.54] I don't like it
[810.54 → 817.54] But I don't like it any more than any other piece of trash keyboard
[817.54 → 818.54] Samsung's is terrible
[818.54 → 819.54] Like touch pal
[819.54 → 820.54] I've never used touch pal
[820.54 → 821.54] I'm not a fan of touch pal
[821.54 → 822.54] Okay
[822.54 → 823.54] Yeah
[823.54 → 826.54] They're all pretty Garbo
[826.54 → 833.54] And the only reason I like Swift Key is that there are a few little customizations that I make to it that make it very, very usable
[833.54 → 837.54] So I shorten the long press so you can get it all your special characters without switching keyboards
[837.54 → 841.54] Not all but the vast majority of them so it makes it faster to use
[842.54 → 843.54] I don't flow type
[843.54 → 846.54] So some people tell me that Swift Key's flow is not very good
[846.54 → 847.54] Don't care, don't flow
[847.54 → 848.54] I don't do that either
[848.54 → 854.54] And that's pretty much it actually that's pretty much all I changed
[854.54 → 857.54] Yeah I'm at the point where using other keyboards feels weird
[857.54 → 860.54] But the prediction of Swift Key is fantastic
[860.54 → 865.54] Like I can basically look away and kind of like mash at my keyboard, and it's going to be like
[865.54 → 866.54] Did you mean?
[866.54 → 868.54] I'm like yeah, pretty much
[868.54 → 873.54] If I'm on a keyboard that I don't often use I like can't type anymore
[873.54 → 874.54] I know
[874.54 → 875.54] Because
[875.54 → 876.54] I know, we've all turned like helpless
[876.54 → 882.54] I like definitely run typos pretty much all the time and Swift Key's just like I'll do all this
[882.54 → 884.54] Everything will be fine
[884.54 → 885.54] Yeah
[885.54 → 889.54] Another creepy thing in that same vein right now is Google's auto predictions for email
[889.54 → 890.54] Have you seen that?
[890.54 → 891.54] I've seen it on
[891.54 → 894.54] I've seen it on my mobile app
[894.54 → 895.54] I only get it on my phone
[895.54 → 896.54] With the three
[896.54 → 897.54] And then on here
[897.54 → 898.54] Email me
[898.54 → 899.54] It's going to take a sec
[899.54 → 904.54] Yeah, well, no, maybe I can hold on maybe I got one here
[904.54 → 905.54] You probably
[905.54 → 906.54] Oh no, no here, yeah, yeah, I got one
[906.54 → 908.54] So on here I get all kinds of stuff
[908.54 → 910.54] So I can click reply
[910.54 → 911.54] So I can use voice
[911.54 → 913.54] Or I can say okay, yes, no, thumbs up, smiley
[913.54 → 914.54] Whoa
[914.54 → 918.54] Sad heart, lol, thanks, got it done, nice, I don't know what, why, what's up?
[918.54 → 924.54] Okay, give me a moment, on my way, sounds good, big happy face, very sad face, and a heart
[924.54 → 926.54] That's just too many options
[926.54 → 927.54] I know
[927.54 → 930.54] By the time I scroll through all that I could take my phone out
[930.54 → 932.54] In the actual app there's just three usually
[932.54 → 934.54] Um
[934.54 → 936.54] Uh, but like
[936.54 → 938.54] I don't know
[938.54 → 939.54] I actually like it
[939.54 → 943.54] Because it's so creepy that it's starting to get perfect
[943.54 → 946.54] Like it started, I was even talking to John about it
[946.54 → 950.54] It has started suggesting responses that sound more like something that I would actually say
[950.54 → 952.54] Oh
[952.54 → 955.54] Mine hasn't really gotten any better, I don't use it
[955.54 → 956.54] Mine's gotten better
[956.54 → 957.54] Huh
[957.54 → 958.54] And I've rarely used it
[958.54 → 960.54] I think it's just farming the data from my Gmail
[960.54 → 962.54] That's very interesting
[962.54 → 965.54] Like I got one that was like, okay great, that's awesome
[966.54 → 967.54] And I was like
[967.54 → 970.54] That's exactly what I was gonna type
[970.54 → 971.54] What? Yeah
[971.54 → 974.54] So the next step is when it doesn't even bother asking you to press the button
[974.54 → 975.54] It just does it
[975.54 → 976.54] It's just like, book
[976.54 → 977.54] You can delete it if you want, but it's already there
[977.54 → 978.54] Yeah
[978.54 → 979.54] Yeah
[979.54 → 980.54] Yeah
[980.54 → 981.54] Pretty epic
[981.54 → 982.54] Alright
[982.54 → 983.54] I don't know how we got here
[983.54 → 985.54] But I think we're now on Asus Thread ripper MOB unboxing
[985.54 → 986.54] Yeah
[986.54 → 989.54] So this is from videocards.com
[989.54 → 990.54] So
[990.54 → 993.54] Honestly, there's not a lot to it
[993.54 → 994.54] Um
[994.54 → 995.54] The only thing that was missed
[995.54 → 997.54] So I've seen the board already
[997.54 → 998.54] The only thing that was missing
[998.54 → 1000.54] Was the accessories
[1000.54 → 1003.54] But now we're able to have a look at what is included
[1003.54 → 1005.54] So there's some kind of PCI Express riser card
[1005.54 → 1008.54] I'm going to guess that's like M.2 or something
[1008.54 → 1012.54] What is the point of doing an unboxing like this and leaving all the stuff in the packaging?
[1012.54 → 1014.54] Did they really do that?
[1014.54 → 1017.54] Okay, so yeah, here's an M.2 riser doodad
[1017.54 → 1020.54] Uh, four-way SLI bridge?
[1020.54 → 1021.54] Why?
[1021.54 → 1023.54] I guess if this is like a
[1024.54 → 1027.54] Like a just for benchmarking type of product
[1027.54 → 1029.54] It's pretty high-end so
[1029.54 → 1030.54] Might make sense
[1030.54 → 1032.54] I wouldn't be super surprised
[1032.54 → 1035.54] We've got like a GPU support bracket it looks like
[1035.54 → 1039.54] We've got uh, Giorno Wi-Fi antennas
[1039.54 → 1042.54] So this is going to have like AD Wi-Fi I think
[1042.54 → 1044.54] Uh, big page of stickers
[1044.54 → 1046.54] There's a PCI Ethernet card
[1046.54 → 1049.54] This is what I don't get
[1049.54 → 1050.54] You know?
[1050.54 → 1051.54] Why?
[1051.54 → 1055.54] And this is coming from someone who
[1056.54 → 1060.54] Actually made his mark
[1060.54 → 1063.54] Like and built his career
[1063.54 → 1065.54] On unboxing videos
[1066.54 → 1070.54] Why did unboxing videos ever need to exist?
[1070.54 → 1072.54] When you could just have this
[1072.54 → 1076.54] I mean, yes, this is sort of a crap job they did of it
[1076.54 → 1078.54] But like if you could just have
[1078.54 → 1082.54] I think it's uh, harder to do
[1082.54 → 1085.54] Like you can do a really, really crap job with a video unboxing
[1085.54 → 1087.54] And it can still be better than this
[1090.54 → 1091.54] You know what I'm saying?
[1091.54 → 1093.54] But I can see everything that's in the box
[1093.54 → 1094.54] Like I've watched a lot of
[1094.54 → 1095.54] I've watched a lot
[1095.54 → 1096.54] Yeah, but it doesn't necessarily matter
[1096.54 → 1097.54] No, not really
[1097.54 → 1098.54] I've never gotten this, you know?
[1098.54 → 1099.54] Look how much light glint is on these freaking packages
[1099.54 → 1101.54] Okay, I mean this is a bad picture
[1101.54 → 1103.54] This one literally has the anti-static on it
[1103.54 → 1104.54] You can't tell what it is
[1104.54 → 1105.54] That's useless
[1105.54 → 1107.54] This is literally useless
[1107.54 → 1108.54] This is also useless
[1108.54 → 1109.54] So is that
[1109.54 → 1111.54] Is that a box of something?
[1111.54 → 1112.54] I can't tell
[1112.54 → 1113.54] All these other things have light glint on it
[1113.54 → 1115.54] I can't tell what the vast majority of these things are
[1115.54 → 1116.54] Okay, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
[1116.54 → 1120.54] Okay, but assuming this picture wasn't taken by like
[1120.54 → 1122.54] But that's the point, if it's a video it'll be moving
[1122.54 → 1123.54] You'll probably be able to see better what it is
[1123.54 → 1124.54] So you'll be able to
[1124.54 → 1125.54] Okay, so you're
[1125.54 → 1127.54] Are you really making the argument I think
[1127.54 → 1128.54] Hold on, hold on
[1128.54 → 1134.54] Hold on, you're telling me that video is better because you could watch frame by frame and maybe see the like
[1134.54 → 1135.54] Yes
[1135.54 → 1144.54] I have for like really weird niche products I have watched terrible like cell phone in the hand one hand unboxing videos of it
[1144.54 → 1146.54] To try to figure out what's actually going on
[1146.54 → 1150.54] And like kind of scrubbed through it so that I could see better because it was that bad
[1150.54 → 1152.54] And it has answered questions that I've been looking for
[1153.54 → 1154.54] I've had it work for me
[1154.54 → 1155.54] Okay
[1156.54 → 1157.54] Alright
[1157.54 → 1159.54] I'll let it slide on this one
[1161.54 → 1165.54] Also announced is the Crosshair 6 Extreme
[1166.54 → 1167.54] Extreme
[1167.54 → 1173.54] They're finally going full high end on AM4
[1174.54 → 1178.54] So RGB lighting, blah blah blah for more than a decade
[1178.54 → 1184.54] It really does speak to the industry's confidence in Ry zen
[1184.54 → 1185.54] Yeah
[1185.54 → 1187.54] That we're finally seeing truly high-end boards
[1187.54 → 1193.54] Because I would have AMD fans complain that like
[1194.54 → 1195.54] The boards are
[1195.54 → 1196.54] All the good boards are for Intel
[1196.54 → 1197.54] Yeah
[1197.54 → 1198.54] And it's like
[1198.54 → 1199.54] Yeah
[1199.54 → 1200.54] Because
[1202.54 → 1210.54] Other than like a handful of people who are completely blind to the products that exist
[1210.54 → 1211.54] Other than them
[1211.54 → 1212.54] Other than them
[1213.54 → 1214.54] Anybody else
[1214.54 → 1215.54] With you know
[1216.54 → 1218.54] 200 plus dollars to spend on a board
[1219.54 → 1221.54] Is buying an Intel chip right now
[1222.54 → 1224.54] Sorry
[1225.54 → 1227.54] And the motherboard manufacturers
[1228.54 → 1229.54] They don't just
[1230.54 → 1231.54] They don't just know this
[1232.54 → 1233.54] From like a
[1234.54 → 1235.54] They have an ounce of sense
[1235.54 → 1237.54] And can read a benchmark chart
[1237.54 → 1238.54] They know this
[1238.54 → 1239.54] From a
[1239.54 → 1242.54] They are seeing actual real sales numbers
[1243.54 → 1244.54] Yeah
[1244.54 → 1248.54] As AMD's lineup gets more and more and more irrelevant
[1249.54 → 1251.54] At this point in time if I was building a new system
[1252.54 → 1253.54] I would be very heavily looking at AMD
[1254.54 → 1257.54] Which isn't something that I've been able to say for a very long time
[1258.54 → 1262.54] And seeing this kind of variety in the products that are available
[1263.54 → 1266.54] Seeing someone like ASUS go okay, sure, yeah
[1267.54 → 1272.54] We've got the confidence to put the R&D behind what will probably be a $300 to $400 board
[1273.54 → 1274.54] US
[1275.54 → 1276.54] To put the R&D behind it
[1277.54 → 1281.54] Because we know that we're going to get enough of even this kind of high-end product
[1282.54 → 1283.54] Moved off the shelf
[1283.54 → 1284.54] That we're going to recoup that cost
[1285.54 → 1286.54] And maybe even make some money
[1287.54 → 1289.54] To see that is really confidence inspiring
[1290.54 → 1292.54] I am just stoked
[1292.54 → 1293.54] Yeah
[1293.54 → 1294.54] That's cool man
[1295.54 → 1296.54] I don't really know what else to say about that
[1297.54 → 1298.54] I don't necessarily have the same confidence in Vega
[1299.54 → 1304.54] You're going to have to wait for the video to see the full kind of rant
[1304.54 → 1316.54] But Frontier Edition is like far more of a piece of garbage than other reviews necessarily indicated
[1317.54 → 1324.54] So our review of it is basically like this is an early access game
[1324.54 → 1339.54] Like this is paying more for like access to the select DLC so that you can have the buggy gaming experience
[1339.54 → 1345.54] And then not even get the like expansion pack that you then have to go and buy anyway
[1346.54 → 1347.54] That's when they actually fix it
[1348.54 → 1349.54] Like...
[1350.54 → 1352.54] It's a bad product
[1353.54 → 1355.54] I'm really excited about that video
[1356.54 → 1359.54] Yeah, it's going to be one of those where like
[1360.54 → 1366.54] The vast majority of the people who watch it are going to be sensible people who can look at
[1367.54 → 1369.54] The comment section in there is going to be horrible
[1370.54 → 1371.54] So there's going to be...
[1371.54 → 1373.54] So I'm talking thumbs up thumbs down, okay?
[1373.54 → 1374.54] Yeah
[1374.54 → 1379.54] So there's going to be the vast majority of like sensible people who can look at
[1380.54 → 1381.54] Facts objectively
[1382.54 → 1384.54] And who can look at benchmarks objectively
[1385.54 → 1389.54] And who don't leave a comment because they just aren't that invested in it
[1390.54 → 1393.54] And then there's going to be everybody else who engages with this video
[1394.54 → 1395.54] And it's like...
[1396.54 → 1397.54] And that's exactly what those people sound like
[1397.54 → 1404.54] Well, like even the other side of the pool because you're talking about people that would dislike something because you dislike something that is from AMD
[1405.54 → 1408.54] Even from the other side of the pool, we were just talking about how cool this stuff is
[1409.54 → 1411.54] Oh, I guess they can't see it on screen, but on Linus' screen right now
[1412.54 → 1413.54] This AMD stuff
[1414.54 → 1416.54] And someone in the chat, in Twitch chat, I saw just scroll through
[1417.54 → 1418.54] All caps, everything
[1419.54 → 1420.54] AMD
[1420.54 → 1421.54] NO
[1424.54 → 1426.54] No further information or contact
[1427.54 → 1428.54] Just...
[1429.54 → 1430.54] This is my opinion
[1433.54 → 1434.54] I don't think that's cool because it's AMD
[1435.54 → 1436.54] I didn't ask
[1437.54 → 1438.54] Yeah
[1438.54 → 1439.54] But thanks I guess
[1440.54 → 1441.54] I don't know
[1442.54 → 1443.54] There's people on each side
[1444.54 → 1447.54] There's Intel fanboys, there's AMD fanboys, there's Nvidia fanboys, and everybody hates each other
[1448.54 → 1449.54] Yeah, everybody hates each other
[1450.54 → 1451.54] Now the whole chat is just AMD NO
[1452.54 → 1455.54] AMD NO, alright, thank you everyone, that's wonderful
[1455.54 → 1456.54] I appreciate it
[1456.54 → 1467.54] Alright, next in the news, so this was originally posted by Johnny Corporal Tech on the forum and our original article here is from cbc.ca
[1467.54 → 1473.54] The dark web's largest illegal marketplace, founded by a Canadian
[1474.54 → 1475.54] Oops, I didn't know that
[1476.54 → 1478.54] Shut down by the US
[1478.54 → 1479.54] By the US
[1480.54 → 1483.54] Alright, so let's get into this one a little bit
[1484.54 → 1490.54] So, the US Justice Department has officially shut down the dark web marketplace Alpha Bay
[1490.54 → 1494.54] A site ten times as large as Silk Road
[1495.54 → 1503.54] Accused of allowing hundreds of thousands of people to buy and sell drugs, firearms, computer hacking tools, and other illicit goods
[1504.54 → 1510.54] Because remember, there's lots of illegal stuff besides like, drugs and guns
[1510.54 → 1511.54] Yeah
[1511.54 → 1515.54] Like, for example, like a cell phone signal jammer
[1516.54 → 1517.54] Yeah
[1517.54 → 1519.54] Would be the kind of thing that totally, definitely exists
[1520.54 → 1522.54] Super, definitely is everywhere
[1523.54 → 1529.54] But, is illegal to own or operate in pretty much any developed nation, I would think
[1530.54 → 1531.54] Most, yeah
[1531.54 → 1532.54] Yeah
[1532.54 → 1535.54] So, that's the kind of thing that could end up on a site like this
[1536.54 → 1541.54] The operation included the arrest of suspected Alpha Bay founder, Alexander Mazes
[1542.54 → 1543.54] Mazes
[1544.54 → 1545.54] Mazes, Mazes, Mazes, Mazes, Mazes, Mazes
[1546.54 → 1549.54] A 25-year-old Canadian citizen arrested on behalf of the United States in Thailand
[1549.54 → 1554.54] He apparently took his own life a week later while in Thai custody
[1555.54 → 1561.54] And he faced charges relating to narcotics distribution, identity theft, money laundering, and related crimes
[1562.54 → 1563.54] Basically, he was screwed
[1564.54 → 1566.54] And he was sure that he was not getting out, I guess
[1567.54 → 1568.54] Yeah, yeah
[1568.54 → 1578.54] Usernames and passwords of thousands of buyers and sellers of illicit commodities have been identified and are subject to follow-up investigation by Europol and partner agencies
[1579.54 → 1580.54] It's just usernames and passwords, like I
[1581.54 → 1582.54] You know what?
[1583.54 → 1594.54] Remember, this is the world where people give televangelists money to buy private jets
[1594.54 → 1596.54] You know about this, right?
[1596.54 → 1597.54] No
[1597.54 → 1598.54] Yeah, this has happened
[1598.54 → 1599.54] Oh, yes
[1599.54 → 1600.54] More than once
[1600.54 → 1603.54] Where they literally got up there, and they're like
[1604.54 → 1605.54] To spread the word of God
[1606.54 → 1608.54] I need a private jet
[1609.54 → 1611.54] So send me anything you can spare
[1612.54 → 1613.54] Like, that's a thing
[1614.54 → 1615.54] That's a real thing
[1616.54 → 1617.54] They ride around in private jets
[1618.54 → 1620.54] That they literally said they were going to buy
[1621.54 → 1622.54] With donation money
[1623.54 → 1624.54] Tax-free
[1624.54 → 1626.54] So, don't
[1627.54 → 1628.54] Underestimate
[1629.54 → 1634.54] People's ability to use the same username and password that they use on frickin' Facebook
[1635.54 → 1637.54] For a dark web marketplace
[1638.54 → 1640.54] Where you buy, like, drugs
[1641.54 → 1642.54] Yes
[1643.54 → 1644.54] Don't underestimate it
[1645.54 → 1646.54] Hopefully we get a follow-up article on this with like how many people got screwed
[1647.54 → 1649.54] I super-duper hope so
[1649.54 → 1650.54] That would be entertaining
[1651.54 → 1653.54] I need to start the Church of Linus
[1653.54 → 1657.54] Okay, Twitch chats, like, need Church of Linus
[1658.54 → 1660.54] I need a lot of Thread ripper
[1661.54 → 1662.54] I think I would be an excellent
[1663.54 → 1664.54] To spread the word of CPU
[1665.54 → 1667.54] I think I would be an excellent televangelist
[1667.54 → 1668.54] Probably
[1668.54 → 1672.54] I could have so much fun with that shtick
[1673.54 → 1675.54] Luckily you're not
[1676.54 → 1678.54] Would follow, would follow, the best church
[1679.54 → 1680.54] Love it
[1681.54 → 1683.54] Okay, we've got, we've got ourselves at least
[1684.54 → 1687.54] At least, like, 30 followers right now
[1688.54 → 1691.54] Which, which in some states is probably enough for tax-exempt status
[1691.54 → 1692.54] Ha ha ha
[1693.54 → 1696.54] So we are, we are doing this
[1697.54 → 1698.54] Awesome
[1699.54 → 1700.54] Oh man
[1701.54 → 1702.54] Other people want Church of Luke
[1702.54 → 1703.54] You can have your own church, I'm, I'm, you know, I'm cool
[1704.54 → 1707.54] No, we should make a, uh, I can be one of your things
[1708.54 → 1709.54] A denomination?
[1710.54 → 1711.54] Yeah
[1711.54 → 1712.54] You're like the Church of Tech
[1712.54 → 1713.54] Yes
[1713.54 → 1714.54] So you could be like, Lukas
[1715.54 → 1716.54] Yes
[1716.54 → 1719.54] Or like, um, like, uh, uh, uh, you know, Linus Elitism
[1720.54 → 1721.54] Yes
[1721.54 → 1722.54] Perfect
[1722.54 → 1724.54] Yeah, and then like, we can pretend to like, fight
[1724.54 → 1725.54] To make it more interesting
[1726.54 → 1728.54] Just like, uh, those guys that are really popular on YouTube right now
[1729.54 → 1730.54] That I can't remember the name of
[1730.54 → 1732.54] Where they like, pretend little quarrels
[1733.54 → 1735.54] But then behind the scenes, we're like, just finding ways to gather more money
[1736.54 → 1738.54] Apparently John, John Oliver's done it
[1738.54 → 1739.54] I've heard of this
[1739.54 → 1740.54] So there you go, yeah
[1740.54 → 1741.54] Okay, alright
[1741.54 → 1743.54] What hasn't John Oliver done?
[1743.54 → 1746.54] And they like, had to pull it down, because it was like, working too well and stuff
[1747.54 → 1749.54] Yeah, but I think everyone knew it was a joke
[1749.54 → 1750.54] Okay, good
[1750.54 → 1751.54] But people just wanted to contribute because they thought it was funny
[1751.54 → 1752.54] So it was ironically working
[1753.54 → 1754.54] Yes, okay
[1754.54 → 1755.54] I'm pretty sure that's what was going on
[1755.54 → 1757.54] But, I mean, that's still a that's still a pretty good scam
[1757.54 → 1758.54] Oh yeah
[1758.54 → 1760.54] It's like, ha ha, let's show all the idiots
[1760.54 → 1761.54] LOL, give me money
[1761.54 → 1762.54] Ha ha ha
[1764.54 → 1766.54] Oh, terrible
[1766.54 → 1767.54] Yeah
[1767.54 → 1768.54] Alright
[1768.54 → 1769.54] No, no
[1769.54 → 1774.54] The way we make money is, uh, much, much more above board than all of that
[1774.54 → 1779.54] Because we tell you, right now, actually I guess they are just saying, send me money so I can have a jet
[1779.54 → 1780.54] Okay
[1780.54 → 1784.54] So watch this ad spot, so that I can buy
[1784.54 → 1785.54] Definitely not a jet
[1785.54 → 1786.54] Something, not a jet
[1786.54 → 1787.54] So you can hire more people
[1787.54 → 1788.54] Yeah
[1788.54 → 1789.54] FreshBooks

[1835.54 → 1840.54] I saw the booth list, and I'm actually really stoked, I think I'm going to have a lot of fun
[1840.54 → 1848.54] We went from LTX being something that I was really not sure how hard I wanted to sell because I wasn't sure how great it was going to be
[1848.54 → 1852.54] To LTX being like flippin' awesome
[1852.54 → 1853.54] Going to be awesome
[1853.54 → 1854.54] Awesome
[1854.54 → 1860.04] I almost wish I like what hosting a booth is going to be super fun and a new experience for a convention for me
[1860.14 → 1866.98] But like as someone who really enjoys conventions and having the conventions that I go to be less and less about tech
[1867.16 → 1872.64] Seeing this is really exciting. Well, it's VR dude. You could just leave people in VR and like go away. That's fair
[1872.64 → 1875.24] I could probably do that. There's a case toss
[1875.92 → 1877.92] There's a Corsair key swapping competition
[1878.72 → 1883.40] Like leaderboards prizes. Yeah, you wouldn't believe how like some companies
[1883.40 → 1891.28] We reached out we were like hey, could we get some prizes, and they were like sure here's like boxes of like
[1891.54 → 1897.70] Lanyards and cool crap some companies we reached out, and we were like hey, could we get some swag, and they were like
[1898.06 → 1906.28] Boom here's a Titan XP what boom here's multiple GTX 1070s. What boom here's limited edition
[1907.58 → 1909.58] g-force USB drives
[1909.58 → 1920.46] Or boom here's literally like I think a suit sent like 300 or 400 t-shirts what so there's going to be like an Asus t-shirt for like
[1920.46 → 1923.14] Like almost like every other person who's there
[1923.78 → 1925.78] This thing is going to be swag central
[1927.14 → 1933.90] Giveaway central okay. This is the thing at like packs and stuff all the really cool giveaways used to be from the PC guys
[1933.90 → 1938.46] It was rarely the gaming companies they might give it a shirt
[1938.46 → 1943.48] Yeah, but the PC hardware groups like yeah, MSI used to have sick giveaways. I remember that
[1944.02 → 1946.40] NZXT you have sick giveaways Nvidia used to like
[1946.40 → 1952.66] And it was giving away like shields like candy yeah one year they would go into be wow see what might one of my favourite
[1952.66 → 1957.28] Experiences that I ever had at a PAX was an Nvidia giveaway in the BYOC section
[1957.28 → 1959.82] I didn't get to participate in it because we weren't in BYOC yet
[1959.82 → 1964.32] We were in like the free play area, but we could hear it because it's right beside it the first thing that I did
[1964.32 → 1972.12] Was the first person to rip an AMD card out of their system and hand it to me gets a brand new top-of-the-line Nvidia card?
[1972.12 → 1973.58] I don't remember what card it was
[1973.58 → 1978.76] I think it was like a 580 or something but any AMD card out of your system you get a 580 the next one was like some weird competition
[1978.76 → 1983.66] You got another 580 and there's more by the way because not to be upstaged by Nvidia
[1983.66 → 1990.16] Let me tell you AMD is going to have some stuff there yeah some stuff that I actually can't even talk about yeah
[1990.16 → 1995.36] Yeah, and some of the stuff that I can't even talk about might be getting given away
[1995.36 → 1999.66] Yeah, so like there's going to be a thing this is going to be crazy
[2000.32 → 2005.46] We're going to have never before seen Linus media group videos that will never be seen
[2005.78 → 2011.54] Whether they were rejected by the brand or that we couldn't get music licensing figured out for them
[2011.54 → 2017.98] Oh, there's going to be a channel super fun that will probably never see that video that will that might never
[2017.98 → 2019.54] Otherwise see the light of day
[2019.54 → 2021.04] There's going to be
[2021.04 → 2026.92] That's what else we got. I don't know a lot of this 16k gaming is going to be there
[2027.24 → 2035.54] The arcade machines going to be there cool oil PC is going to be there the one and only, and we're doing a silent auction for BC children's hospital
[2035.54 → 2039.88] where I went around, and I found a bunch of relics of
[2041.20 → 2045.78] Linus tech tips, so there's a return drive from the original Cannock server
[2045.78 → 2052.02] Oh, that's pretty so that it's like that kind of stuff, and I was going to have I was going to have Colton and Steph check with you
[2052.02 → 2054.42] But I actually wanted to see if you want to do the fallout bomb
[2054.42 → 2058.76] Oh for sick kids, I might end up just winning it
[2059.76 → 2061.76] You would just buy it
[2061.76 → 2064.66] It's even mine like that's technically
[2064.66 → 2069.02] That's why I want that's why I told them we had to ask you about it. You want to do it?
[2069.02 → 2070.66] We can do it. Yeah, I'll probably just
[2070.66 → 2075.32] I told them I told them that they couldn't do the scrapyard wars PC
[2075.32 → 2079.18] That would probably hurt me a little that I told them that was the limit
[2079.18 → 2083.80] But they were like they wanted like a build of some sort they can do the bomb so okay
[2083.80 → 2086.74] If not the bomb then we'll have the Plastic dip PC
[2086.98 → 2092.00] Okay, so there will be a build there that you'll be able to end the bomb is just an empty case by the way
[2092.00 → 2095.60] But there will be like a case that was featured there's still all the
[2096.50 → 2097.64] wiring
[2097.64 → 2104.12] So like you could it's it has all the like front I O that would be in a normal case so you could build a system in there
[2105.08 → 2108.34] Recreating the thermal setup that I had so that it wouldn't crash at like
[2109.18 → 2111.18] Any load is going to be difficult
[2111.18 → 2113.18] Yeah
[2113.18 → 2115.18] That actually took like a long time
[2115.18 → 2121.18] So anyway LTX is going to be sick, and it's next weekend the 29th
[2121.18 → 2125.46] And if you somehow are like I'm etched out right now, or I don't want to see video games or something for a while
[2125.46 → 2127.46] There's like jousting sumo wrestling
[2127.46 → 2129.64] Bungee run rocket league in real life
[2129.64 → 2132.36] Rocket league in real life. There's an insane amount of stuff to do
[2132.36 → 2135.18] We're going to have onstage unboxing two exclusive onstage unboxing
[2135.18 → 2137.18] I think our biggest issue is going to be that it's
[2137.18 → 2139.18] Uh, not like two days
[2139.18 → 2143.18] Yeah, there's so much stuff to do well, we were worried there wasn't going to be like anything to do no I know
[2143.18 → 2145.18] So we were like really careful with it
[2145.18 → 2153.18] Like ample amount well, you know what we'll probably do is if it's is everyone who comes has a blast and like tells three friends and
[2153.18 → 2157.18] If we have liked you know thousands of people there next year then we'll, we'll probably have to run it over a couple of days
[2157.18 → 2159.18] We'll just have to see how it goes
[2159.18 → 2161.18] Ticket sales sucked
[2161.18 → 2163.18] Like we could have expanded it to a second day
[2163.18 → 2166.18] We checked with the convention centre, but like ticket sales were kind of lame
[2166.18 → 2169.18] So we were like not lame enough that we're like yeah, we have to cancel this
[2169.18 → 2171.18] But like one issue is that it's in Canada
[2171.18 → 2175.18] I know I received a lot of messages. I know that being a problem
[2175.18 → 2181.18] I know but like what are we supposed to do like cart 16k gaming to like LA?
[2181.18 → 2183.18] Well, Seattle
[2183.18 → 2185.18] Still

[2291.18 → 2295.18] The inspiration comes from the flavours of garlic, lime and cilantro which is Mojo
[2295.18 → 2297.18] Garlic, lime and cilantro
[2297.18 → 2298.18] Yeah
[2298.18 → 2302.18] Yeah, so I'm like super stoked on this guy right here
[2302.18 → 2306.18] And because it brings out the natural flavour of premium beef
[2306.18 → 2307.18] I love this stuff
[2307.18 → 2312.18] Use offer code LTT to save 10% on all their products
[2312.18 → 2319.18] Even the super spicy ones like up to the Reaper and like ghost pepper stuff is really delicious
[2319.18 → 2325.18] You just based on my experience last week should probably enjoy it a little bit at a time
[2325.18 → 2328.18] And it depends on your like your tolerance level right?
[2328.18 → 2332.18] That's why I want them to do the challenge pack which I think we still haven't told them about but
[2332.18 → 2333.18] Here we go
[2333.18 → 2334.18] No, only hosts
[2334.18 → 2335.18] Thank you
[2335.18 → 2336.18] Hosts only
[2336.18 → 2339.18] You can have some spice, you can have the really spicy one
[2339.18 → 2340.18] Well that's good
[2340.18 → 2343.18] This one's perfect, this one's like actually not getting shared anymore
[2343.18 → 2344.18] Ha ha ha
[2344.18 → 2345.18] Ha ha
[2345.18 → 2346.18] Ha ha
[2346.18 → 2347.18] Alright
[2347.18 → 2350.18] So uh, oh yeah, use offer code LTT to save 10%
[2350.18 → 2351.18] Wow I like that one
[2351.18 → 2352.18] At savagejerky.com
[2352.18 → 2353.18] This one's like perfect
[2353.18 → 2354.18] I think that's my favourite one
[2354.18 → 2356.18] I snagged the hell
[2356.18 → 2357.18] Oh this is Mojo by the way
[2357.18 → 2358.18] Mojo?
[2358.18 → 2359.18] Freaking awesome
[2359.18 → 2361.18] Savage jerky next time we do a spot
[2361.18 → 2362.18] Send as much Mojo
[2362.18 → 2363.18] More Mojo
[2363.18 → 2364.18] And maple bacon
[2364.18 → 2366.18] And uh, how's the original?
[2366.18 → 2368.18] Uh, that's here
[2368.18 → 2369.18] Oh it's not open yet?
[2369.18 → 2370.18] Yeah
[2370.18 → 2371.18] Oh, okay
[2371.18 → 2372.18] Give me a little knife thing?
[2372.18 → 2373.18] I'll try it a little later
[2373.18 → 2375.18] Uh, alright
[2375.18 → 2378.18] Let's move on to uh, let's move on to another topic here
[2378.18 → 2382.18] We can move on to the topic of hiring flow plane people
[2382.18 → 2384.18] Um
[2384.18 → 2387.18] Or we can move on to the topic of the Noctua fans
[2387.18 → 2388.18] Interesting
[2388.18 → 2389.18] Have you not seen that?
[2389.18 → 2390.18] No
[2390.18 → 2391.18] I kinda, okay
[2391.18 → 2392.18] Yeah
[2392.18 → 2394.18] I was, this was posted by Venus on the forum
[2396.18 → 2398.18] And apparently
[2398.18 → 2401.18] Uh, so this is from r slash buildup
[2402.18 → 2404.18] Posted by uh, Kendall
[2404.18 → 2411.18] Visible manufacturing differences between Noctua fans made in Taiwan versus China
[2412.18 → 2413.18] Yeah
[2413.18 → 2416.18] I'm really wondering what your opinion is on this actually
[2417.18 → 2419.18] I think the Twitch chat probably is too
[2420.18 → 2421.18] Wow
[2421.18 → 2422.18] Yeah
[2422.18 → 2425.18] So the fan blades on the Taiwan fans are noticeably smoother and more rounded
[2427.18 → 2431.18] The flow acceleration channels on the blades of the Taiwan fans are more defined
[2435.18 → 2437.18] The inner surface microstructures
[2438.18 → 2441.18] Of the made in Taiwan's one have a distinct water drop shape
[2441.18 → 2444.18] Whereas the made in China are just a shallow triangular cutout
[2444.18 → 2450.18] I communicate, I was going to say these sound like counterfeits even
[2450.18 → 2458.18] I communicated these differences with Noctua, and they claim that the differences are within their manufacturing tolerances
[2459.18 → 2460.18] And do not affect performance
[2460.18 → 2466.18] But Noctua is known for its reputation of the highest attention to detail
[2467.18 → 2468.18] And I'm sure
[2469.18 → 2470.18] That's also perfect
[2470.18 → 2475.18] That the Noctua engineers designed these tiny details to exacting specifications for some reason
[2475.18 → 2478.18] Is basically what the Reddit post continues to say
[2478.18 → 2479.18] You should try this one
[2481.18 → 2482.18] Apparently
[2482.18 → 2483.18] Now I haven't heard them
[2484.18 → 2486.18] But the made in China fans apparently
[2487.18 → 2494.18] Have a noticeably louder drone when spinning at the same RPM as the other fans
[2494.18 → 2500.18] Now Gamers Nexus is going to be apparently doing tests and going to be making a video on it
[2501.18 → 2502.18] Which is cool
[2502.18 → 2503.18] Or they're reporting back
[2503.18 → 2505.18] Check them out over at GamersNexus.com
[2505.18 → 2507.18] Or they've got a YouTube channel as well
[2507.18 → 2508.18] So they'll probably make a video on this one
[2509.18 → 2510.18] Yeah
[2510.18 → 2511.18] Good guys over there
[2511.18 → 2514.18] They've actually done a lot of good content around this type of stuff
[2514.18 → 2515.18] Yeah
[2515.18 → 2516.18] So I enjoy that
[2516.18 → 2517.18] This is more their wheelhouse than ours anyway
[2517.18 → 2519.18] But I'll definitely be paying close attention
[2519.18 → 2521.18] And we can talk about it on WAN Show in the future
[2521.18 → 2522.18] To how this works out
[2523.18 → 2528.18] And I'm definitely firing up an email over to my contacts over there
[2528.18 → 2531.18] Like what the heck is going on?
[2532.18 → 2533.18] Cause like...
[2535.18 → 2536.18] I'll tell you guys something
[2536.18 → 2537.18] So this is sort of...
[2537.18 → 2538.18] This is sort of...
[2538.18 → 2539.18] This is sort of...
[2539.18 → 2540.18] Very sort of behind the scenes
[2540.18 → 2541.18] Sort of in my brain
[2542.18 → 2543.18] How things work
[2544.18 → 2547.18] One of the business ideas that I would love to explore in the future
[2548.18 → 2551.18] As much as I love selling digital influence
[2551.18 → 2553.18] Which is a great business by the way
[2553.18 → 2556.18] Because you don't have any manufacturing costs
[2557.18 → 2558.18] You don't have to carry any inventory
[2559.18 → 2560.18] I mean...
[2561.18 → 2562.18] Okay, yes, you have to...
[2562.18 → 2563.18] You know, people like that
[2563.18 → 2564.18] You know...
[2564.18 → 2565.18] And...
[2565.18 → 2566.18] Equipment and all that kind of thing
[2566.18 → 2567.18] But...
[2567.18 → 2568.18] But these are one time costs
[2568.18 → 2569.18] Yeah, not per item
[2569.18 → 2572.18] Yeah, you don't have to R&D a new frickin'
[2572.18 → 2573.18] You know...
[2574.18 → 2575.18] Nut and screw or whatever
[2575.18 → 2576.18] Every time you get...
[2576.18 → 2577.18] Like it's...
[2577.18 → 2579.18] Brandy just has to change the lighting setup
[2579.18 → 2580.18] It's somewhat more finite
[2583.18 → 2585.18] So I like the business of selling digital influence
[2585.18 → 2588.18] But one of the companies that I would want to found
[2588.18 → 2590.18] When I have some more time
[2590.18 → 2591.18] And when I am able to do it
[2591.18 → 2595.18] Would be a manufacturer of a physical product
[2596.18 → 2597.18] And...
[2598.18 → 2601.18] A lot of the philosophy that I'm developing for this company
[2602.18 → 2604.18] Is actually borrowed from my perception of Noctua
[2605.18 → 2606.18] Yeah...
[2606.18 → 2608.18] Because I thought of Noctua
[2609.18 → 2611.18] That they were like...
[2612.18 → 2616.18] Like the founders were somehow deeply involved in aerodynamics research
[2616.18 → 2618.18] Or something at some university over there
[2618.18 → 2619.18] I don't remember where I heard it
[2619.18 → 2621.18] But like someone told me that someone told them
[2622.18 → 2623.18] That that was the background
[2624.18 → 2626.18] But that wasn't what happened at all
[2627.18 → 2629.18] RAS COM, the parent company of Noctua
[2630.18 → 2634.18] Was just like a small time European computer hardware distributor
[2635.18 → 2636.18] Like a...
[2637.18 → 2638.18] You know, like a...
[2639.18 → 2640.18] You know, frozen CPU before they went down
[2641.18 → 2642.18] Yeah...
[2642.18 → 2644.18] They were just a distributor of other people's parts
[2645.18 → 2646.18] And then frozen is actually a perfect example
[2646.18 → 2647.18] Of a company that also
[2648.18 → 2649.18] Developed their own products at one point
[2650.18 → 2651.18] And then completely went off the deep end
[2652.18 → 2653.18] Um...
[2654.18 → 2655.18] So when I found that out
[2656.18 → 2657.18] I kind of went, well...
[2658.18 → 2659.18] How is it that your fans are the best?
[2660.18 → 2661.18] And they kind of went, well...
[2662.18 → 2664.18] I went, do you have like brilliant amazing engineers?
[2665.18 → 2667.18] And they were like, well, yeah, we have like, you know, good engineers
[2667.18 → 2673.18] But they're not, you know, leading researchers in the field of, you know, fluid dynamics or anything
[2674.18 → 2675.18] Yeah, yeah
[2675.18 → 2676.18] They're engineers
[2677.18 → 2678.18] And I was like, well then why are yours better than someone else's?
[2679.18 → 2681.18] And they're like, because we don't release it until it's right
[2682.18 → 2684.18] Because of attention to detail
[2685.18 → 2686.18] Because we care
[2687.18 → 2688.18] And this doesn't sound like caring or attention to detail
[2689.18 → 2690.18] No, it doesn't!
[2690.18 → 2691.18] So this is kind of like...
[2692.18 → 2693.18] This is kind of shaking
[2694.18 → 2695.18] Because...
[2695.18 → 2699.18] This is kind of shaking the foundation of a business that I, you know, haven't invested a dollar into yet
[2700.18 → 2701.18] Like I'm not even close to starting it
[2702.18 → 2704.18] But one that I... that I do want to start at some point
[2705.18 → 2709.18] And that I... that I had planned to build around basically the Noctua philosophy
[2710.18 → 2712.18] Charge as much as it takes
[2713.18 → 2717.18] To make a profit on the best product you could build
[2717.18 → 2719.18] So it's going to be expensive
[2720.18 → 2722.18] But make sure that what you build is the best
[2723.18 → 2724.18] That was... that was the idea
[2725.18 → 2726.18] And I'm... I'm sort of...
[2727.18 → 2728.18] You know, I don't want to get ahead of myself
[2729.18 → 2731.18] Because if there's anything that I'm a fanboy of
[2732.18 → 2733.18] It's Noctua fans
[2734.18 → 2735.18] Yes
[2736.18 → 2737.18] So I'm not going to freak out yet
[2738.18 → 2739.18] I also want to point out that the link that I posted in the chat
[2740.18 → 2743.18] For the Reddit conversation does have a video doing the sound comparison
[2743.18 → 2746.18] It does have a lot of frame colour difference pictures
[2747.18 → 2749.18] It has a lot of comparison images for a ton of different things
[2750.18 → 2751.18] This guy has done a lot of work
[2752.18 → 2754.18] He's obviously affected
[2755.18 → 2757.18] He might be as much of a Noctua fanboy as you are
[2758.18 → 2759.18] Wow!
[2764.18 → 2765.18] Huh...
[2766.18 → 2767.18] Well, let's...
[2768.18 → 2769.18] See how that goes
[2769.18 → 2771.18] I'm interested
[2772.18 → 2773.18] Yeah
[2773.18 → 2774.18] If this is... if this is true
[2775.18 → 2778.18] What is... what is the name of that other brand?
[2779.18 → 2780.18] Um...
[2781.18 → 2782.18] They're black and white fans
[2783.18 → 2784.18] Oh, Noise Blocker?
[2784.18 → 2785.18] Noise Blocker
[2785.18 → 2787.18] If this is true, will you actually try a Noise Blocker fan?
[2788.18 → 2789.18] Wow
[2790.18 → 2791.18] Cause this is... okay, this has been like...
[2792.18 → 2793.18] I don't bring it up much
[2794.18 → 2795.18] Because we talked about it a lot a long time ago
[2795.18 → 2796.18] And this conversation has just...
[2797.18 → 2798.18] Concluded
[2799.18 → 2800.18] Like there's nothing else to really talk about
[2801.18 → 2802.18] It was just like...
[2803.18 → 2804.18] No...
[2805.18 → 2806.18] I found a fan, I really like it
[2806.18 → 2807.18] This is... this is perfect
[2808.18 → 2809.18] And I'm going to use it forever
[2809.18 → 2810.18] And I'm going to use it forever
[2810.18 → 2811.18] And that's fine, it's a fan
[2812.18 → 2813.18] You found one that fit your specifications
[2814.18 → 2815.18] And...
[2815.18 → 2817.18] It's not so much that I refuse to use Noise Blocker or something like that
[2817.18 → 2818.18] It's just like...
[2819.18 → 2822.18] If Noise Blocker was better than an NFF 12
[2823.18 → 2826.18] Then it... like it really wasn't by much
[2827.18 → 2829.18] And a big part of what I trusted about Noctua
[2830.18 → 2831.18] And trust about Noctua...
[2832.18 → 2833.18] Trust it, I don't know, it's like...
[2834.18 → 2835.18] I don't know what... I don't know what anything is anymore
[2836.18 → 2837.18] Trust me, it's an interesting thing
[2838.18 → 2839.18] A big part of what I have trusted about Noctua
[2840.18 → 2842.18] Is inside information that I have
[2842.18 → 2847.18] From being the product manager on their line and seeing real world RMA rates
[2848.18 → 2850.18] They don't die, or like anything can die
[2851.18 → 2852.18] But they generally don't
[2853.18 → 2854.18] Very... uncommon
[2854.18 → 2855.18] Very reliable
[2856.18 → 2857.18] I'm just saying right now
[2858.18 → 2859.18] But if all these other things could be different
[2860.18 → 2861.18] Maybe that could be different too
[2862.18 → 2866.18] Noise Blocker Black Silent Pro fans look really slick
[2868.18 → 2869.18] I'm just saying
[2869.18 → 2875.18] Alright, well speaking of companies that are capable of both delighting and disappointing me
[2876.18 → 2879.18] Our next bit of news posted by HK05 on the forum
[2880.18 → 2882.18] Is originally from VideoCards.com
[2883.18 → 2884.18] And is a rumour about Intel
[2885.18 → 2890.18] So Intel is allegedly working on multiple Hex core Coffee Lake CPUs
[2891.18 → 2897.18] So Coffee Lake, for those of you not familiar, will be the replacement to Kaby Lake
[2897.18 → 2900.18] And that will be a mainstream processor
[2901.18 → 2902.18] So this tells us a couple of things
[2903.18 → 2907.18] This tells us either that Intel of its own accord
[2908.18 → 2912.18] Had been finally intending to deliver a 6-core mainstream processor anyway
[2913.18 → 2915.18] Before AMD dropped Ry zen
[2916.18 → 2917.18] Or...
[2918.18 → 2923.18] That Intel became aware that Ry zen was going to be pretty good
[2923.18 → 2925.18] Through corporate espionage
[2926.18 → 2928.18] Far before the rest of the industry knew about it
[2929.18 → 2930.18] And started working on this
[2931.18 → 2932.18] Or just already had it
[2933.18 → 2935.18] And just decided not to do anything with it
[2936.18 → 2937.18] I don't think so
[2938.18 → 2939.18] Because if they'd already had it, they could have done it with Kaby Lake
[2940.18 → 2941.18] Right
[2942.18 → 2944.18] Whereas Coffee Lake is going to be a new platform
[2944.18 → 2945.18] Yeah
[2945.18 → 2946.18] So it's going to be a new chipset
[2947.18 → 2948.18] I think if they had been...
[2949.18 → 2951.18] If they had known about it two years ago
[2952.18 → 2953.18] We'd have it in Kaby Lake
[2954.18 → 2955.18] Yeah
[2955.18 → 2956.18] Whereas if they knew about it like a year and a half ago
[2957.18 → 2958.18] Then...
[2959.18 → 2960.18] Either they decided on their own, it's time
[2961.18 → 2962.18] Or...
[2962.18 → 2963.18] Or they weren't willing to...
[2963.18 → 2968.18] Throw a fast one at motherboard manufacturers again so hard with mainstream processors
[2969.18 → 2970.18] Okay, I guess so
[2971.18 → 2975.18] It might be easier to throw a fast one at them with motherboards that they won't have to make nearly as many of
[2976.18 → 2978.18] This could be very disruptive to Ry zen
[2978.18 → 2979.18] Yeah
[2981.18 → 2982.18] Yeah
[2982.18 → 2983.18] But I think Ry zen has...
[2984.18 → 2986.18] AMD as a whole probably at this point
[2987.18 → 2988.18] Gotten a lot more customers
[2989.18 → 2990.18] Just because people are more interested in them
[2990.18 → 2992.18] Because they're tired of some of the crap from the other side
[2993.18 → 2994.18] I can see that
[2995.18 → 2997.18] And I feel like a lot of the communication that's currently going around AMD
[2998.18 → 3000.18] Isn't going to go away even if Intel releases a good processor
[3001.18 → 3003.18] Because there are certain like business practice things that people didn't like
[3004.18 → 3005.18] That's true, yep
[3005.18 → 3008.18] So I think those communication lines might keep them going
[3008.18 → 3010.18] And I mean, a lot of people
[3011.18 → 3014.18] Will buy based on a particular brand loyalty
[3015.18 → 3016.18] Yeah, or you'll see a post on PCMR that's like
[3017.18 → 3018.18] Oh, these are great and just go buy that
[3019.18 → 3022.18] And if either product is like good
[3023.18 → 3024.18] Yeah
[3025.18 → 3026.18] Then there's really nothing wrong with that
[3027.18 → 3028.18] And people aren't going to fight super hard if they're both good products
[3029.18 → 3030.18] Like, you know, you go back
[3031.18 → 3034.18] You go back far enough to when, you know, AMD and NVIDIA were pretty compromised
[3035.18 → 3037.18] So, like, you know, we could look at the
[3038.18 → 3041.18] Like the X-800 era or something like that
[3042.18 → 3043.18] Like an X-800 Pro
[3044.18 → 3051.18] Was like pretty frickin' similar to a 7800 GT or whatever the contemporary one was
[3052.18 → 3053.18] I can't remember exactly
[3054.18 → 3056.18] Or was it 60, 6800?
[3057.18 → 3059.18] 6800 GT? I don't remember
[3059.18 → 3060.18] I don't know, I don't remember
[3060.18 → 3061.18] Anyway, they were pretty darn close
[3061.18 → 3063.18] It came down to whether you liked Catalyst Control Centre
[3064.18 → 3065.18] Or was it still called Detonator at the time?
[3066.18 → 3067.18] I don't remember, whatever NVIDIA's driver was called
[3068.18 → 3071.18] Thank you to everyone in the Twitch chat that is currently going Intel No
[3072.18 → 3073.18] I love that that meme is still going
[3073.18 → 3081.18] Alright, anyway, here's kind of the summary of these rumours
[3082.18 → 3087.18] K version will have a 3.7 GHz base with hyper-threading enabled
[3087.18 → 3090.18] So that's 12 threads and the 9K running at 3.2
[3091.18 → 3093.18] TDP of 95 watts, which should be quite doable
[3094.18 → 3096.18] And then there will apparently, and that'll be the flagship
[3097.18 → 3098.18] So that'll be the 8700
[3099.18 → 3100.18] The 8700 series
[3101.18 → 3104.18] Then the there'll be a 6-core i5 as well
[3105.18 → 3106.18] Wow, oh, that's interesting
[3107.18 → 3110.18] With that being the slowest 6-core desktop
[3111.18 → 3112.18] The 8600K
[3112.18 → 3113.18] 3.6 GHz
[3114.18 → 3115.18] And then 95 watt TDP
[3115.18 → 3116.18] No hyper-threading
[3117.18 → 3121.18] Wait, no, the slowest 6-core will be a Core i5-8400
[3122.18 → 3127.18] Wow, so that could be like, that could be like $170, $175 price point
[3128.18 → 3129.18] Ooh
[3130.18 → 3134.18] That one, the article is saying, looks like a direct response to AMD's Ry zen 5
[3134.18 → 3135.18] Yeah
[3135.18 → 3139.18] Intel will also apparently introduce an actual mobile CPU
[3140.18 → 3141.18] With 6 cores
[3141.18 → 3142.18] Wow
[3142.18 → 3144.18] With much lower clock speeds and a 45 watt TDP
[3144.18 → 3149.18] So you'd expect to find that in something like an Acer Predator 21x refresh
[3149.18 → 3151.18] Or something along those lines
[3152.18 → 3153.18] Wow
[3154.18 → 3155.18] It's apparently
[3155.18 → 3158.18] Yeah, okay, so sorry, I just gotta give an update on the, the nose in chat
[3158.18 → 3159.18] Hold on, one more thing
[3159.18 → 3162.18] It's apparently unclear at this time whether these will require new motherboards
[3162.18 → 3163.18] Though I would have thought they would
[3164.18 → 3165.18] Yeah
[3165.18 → 3166.18] So don't quote me on that one
[3166.18 → 3167.18] Okay, go ahead
[3168.18 → 3170.18] It has divulged, it started with AMD No
[3171.18 → 3173.18] And then it transferred into Intel No
[3174.18 → 3175.18] With this article, which was funny
[3176.18 → 3179.18] And now it's just turned into like anything no
[3180.18 → 3181.18] Perfect
[3181.18 → 3182.18] It's just, it's chaos
[3183.18 → 3184.18] It's chaos in Switch Chat
[3184.18 → 3185.18] The bots banning everybody
[3185.18 → 3187.18] It's just, it's, it's hell out there man
[3188.18 → 3190.18] You have to, you have to fight to survive
[3193.18 → 3194.18] Alright
[3194.18 → 3197.18] So we can probably skim, uh, yeah, there really isn't much going on here
[3197.18 → 3198.18] Oh, okay
[3199.18 → 3204.18] Um, so, Nintendo applied for a patent for its Nintendo 64 controller
[3205.18 → 3208.18] They reapplied for Nintendo 64 controller patents
[3208.18 → 3213.18] Um, so there's probably a Nintendo 64 classic coming after the SNES classic
[3214.18 → 3217.18] Um, but, who knows, and it's not coming for a long time
[3217.18 → 3220.18] And it's pretty expected that that would happen anyway, so, yeah
[3221.18 → 3222.18] Cool
[3223.18 → 3224.18] Yeah
[3224.18 → 3226.18] Can you, like, how much are NEW classics at this point?
[3226.18 → 3227.18] Very expensive
[3228.18 → 3231.18] Um, apparently people have found some that got restocked
[3231.18 → 3232.18] Hmm
[3232.18 → 3236.18] So, there's a little bit of rumour going around that they might start actually manufacturing all of them
[3236.18 → 3237.18] Instead of just having them as one year runs
[3238.18 → 3239.18] Yeah, because it's so stupid
[3239.18 → 3240.18] Yeah
[3240.18 → 3241.18] Like, it's just like printing money
[3241.18 → 3244.18] And there's a lot of, there's a lot of people that want to have the set
[3244.18 → 3246.18] Like Nintendo, why do you hate money?
[3246.18 → 3247.18] Yeah
[3247.18 → 3248.18] I just, I don't even
[3248.18 → 3249.18] They have so much
[3250.18 → 3252.18] I, I really love it when people are like
[3252.18 → 3254.18] Man, that was a stupid decision from Nintendo
[3254.18 → 3255.18] They're going to die as a company
[3255.18 → 3257.18] I'm like, no they're not
[3257.18 → 3258.18] Oh my god
[3258.18 → 3260.18] Nintendo can survive for like, ever
[3260.18 → 3262.18] While making terrible decisions
[3262.18 → 3264.18] Because they have so much money
[3264.18 → 3265.18] It doesn't even matter
[3265.18 → 3267.18] They'll, they'll like, fail repeatedly
[3267.18 → 3269.18] And then just release another like, Wii or Switch
[3269.18 → 3271.18] The Switch is doing incredibly well
[3271.18 → 3274.18] It's like, oh, the Wii U didn't matter and no one knew it existed?
[3274.18 → 3275.18] That's fine
[3275.18 → 3280.18] Nintendo would have survived and then just smash the gaming world again with some other new console
[3280.18 → 3281.18] Doesn't matter
[3282.18 → 3284.18] They have like a way more intense version of the Microsoft
[3284.18 → 3286.18] Like, every second OS thing
[3286.18 → 3287.18] Mm hmm
[3287.18 → 3288.18] Yeah
[3291.18 → 3293.18] Um, hmm, this is kinda funny
[3293.18 → 3294.18] Yeah
[3294.18 → 3298.18] Posted by Dyson on the forum, the original article here is from the BBC
[3300.18 → 3305.18] A Chinese mall introduces husband storage pods for shopping wives
[3306.18 → 3309.18] Husbands can play old school games like Taken 3 in the pods
[3311.18 → 3312.18] I'm also going to chime in
[3312.18 → 3314.18] I want this in the North American malls
[3314.18 → 3316.18] Okay, no, not necessarily
[3316.18 → 3319.18] Uh, apparently there's no ventilation or air conditioning
[3319.18 → 3322.18] Some guy sat in and played for five minutes and was just drenched in sweat
[3323.18 → 3324.18] Okay
[3324.18 → 3326.18] So, maybe better ones
[3326.18 → 3327.18] Yeah, maybe better ones
[3327.18 → 3331.18] So, these are glass pods where women can leave their partners while they shop
[3331.18 → 3335.18] Inside each individual pod is a chair, monitor, computer, and game pad
[3335.18 → 3338.18] And men can sit and play retro 1990s games
[3338.18 → 3339.18] If they did
[3339.18 → 3340.18] The service is currently free
[3340.18 → 3341.18] Yeah
[3341.18 → 3344.18] But in the future users will have to pay to scan a QR code
[3345.18 → 3347.18] Pay and scan a QR code to use the service
[3348.18 → 3352.18] They should just make it so that you like pair up with the person that you're shopping with
[3352.18 → 3355.18] And as they make purchases, it like gives you more time
[3357.18 → 3358.18] You know what I mean?
[3358.18 → 3359.18] Because you don't actually have to pay for it
[3359.18 → 3360.18] It's just tied in with like
[3360.18 → 3362.18] Someone in your group is spending money at the mall
[3363.18 → 3365.18] So you get to stay in your little pod
[3365.18 → 3368.18] And they should make it so you can like order food to it and everything
[3369.18 → 3370.18] That would be awesome
[3370.18 → 3373.18] I just also want to bring up that the no's in chat
[3373.18 → 3377.18] Switch to money no, Nintendo no, and profit no
[3377.18 → 3378.18] So, excellent
[3378.18 → 3379.18] Good job
[3379.18 → 3380.18] Thank you for the update
[3380.18 → 3381.18] Keep going
[3381.18 → 3382.18] Love to see it
[3382.18 → 3384.18] The original article here is from TechCrunch
[3384.18 → 3385.18] Pod note
[3385.18 → 3386.18] Ah
[3386.18 → 3391.18] YouTube launches its counter-terrorism experiment for would-be ISIS recruits
[3392.18 → 3395.18] And basically what's going on here is that
[3396.18 → 3403.18] Now when a potential ISIS recruit searches for known extremist content on YouTube using a predefined set of keywords
[3403.18 → 3409.18] They will instead be redirected to videos that deconstruct and confront the terrorist group
[3410.18 → 3411.18] So, uh
[3411.18 → 3412.18] ISIS no
[3412.18 → 3413.18] ISIS no
[3413.18 → 3414.18] ISIS no
[3414.18 → 3415.18] ISIS no
[3415.18 → 3416.18] I get way too much entertainment from this
[3416.18 → 3418.18] I am completely okay with this
[3418.18 → 3424.18] So these are curated YouTube videos debunking ISIS recruiting themes
[3424.18 → 3425.18] Yeah
[3425.18 → 3429.18] This open methodology was developed from interviews with ISIS defectors
[3429.18 → 3434.18] Respects users privacy and can be deployed to tackle other types of violent recruiting discourses online
[3434.18 → 3436.18] So that's where this gets kind of dicey
[3436.18 → 3437.18] That does go well
[3437.18 → 3438.18] Where is the line?
[3438.18 → 3439.18] Yeah
[3439.18 → 3440.18] So the recruit
[3440.18 → 3450.18] The redirect method began with an eight-week pilot program enlisting 320,000 viewers that explored some key insights around the kind of things that potential ISIS recruits search for
[3450.18 → 3454.18] To be fair though, this YouTube is not a government website
[3454.18 → 3455.18] Mm-hmm
[3455.18 → 3457.18] They can suggest, and they have a suggestion algorithm
[3457.18 → 3459.18] They can suggest whatever they want to you
[3459.18 → 3460.18] Mm-hmm
[3460.18 → 3462.18] This is why stuff like float plane makes sense
[3462.18 → 3465.18] Except maybe not for that type of content
[3465.18 → 3466.18] Yeah
[3466.18 → 3473.18] But like if you want to specifically see one thing that you're searching for going to one website that has like a crazy machine learning algorithm
[3473.18 → 3477.18] That's trying to just give you what it wants to give you is not necessarily the greatest way to go
[3477.18 → 3482.18] So effective deterrents apparently include documentary videos
[3482.18 → 3483.18] That's a good idea
[3483.18 → 3484.18] Citizen journalism
[3484.18 → 3485.18] That one's interesting
[3485.18 → 3486.18] That one's interesting
[3486.18 → 3488.18] Videos that feature religious debates
[3488.18 → 3490.18] And videos from ISIS defectors
[3490.18 → 3492.18] I wouldn't have thought necessarily the third one
[3492.18 → 3494.18] The religious debate one is weird
[3494.18 → 3496.18] Because I could just see that fuelling someone even more
[3496.18 → 3497.18] Well, maybe not
[3497.18 → 3506.18] I think maybe these people are obviously okay, okay, I'm going to be careful here, but I would think
[3507.18 → 3520.18] That someone who manages to be converted to an extremist is probably pretty um, how you say, the force would work on them
[3520.18 → 3522.18] They're probably pretty
[3522.18 → 3523.18] Simple?
[3523.18 → 3524.18] Suggestible
[3524.18 → 3525.18] Yes, right, okay, there we go
[3525.18 → 3534.18] Yeah, so it wouldn't take an Obi-Wan because he has a special gift for it just basically anyone so if you just throw a debate in front of them
[3535.18 → 3542.18] Maybe that and Quinton who never successfully does it in the movies would be able to manage it too many Star Wars memes. Sorry
[3543.18 → 3546.18] Yeah, I's that's interesting. Oh
[3547.18 → 3549.68] I like I can't be upset about it
[3549.68 → 3554.68] This particular instance I have no issue with at all
[3554.68 → 3558.68] Mm-hmm. Um, seeing where this goes could be a big problem
[3558.68 → 3561.68] Uh, again, I personally think it's a private company
[3561.68 → 3563.68] It's not a government agency
[3563.68 → 3564.68] They can kind of do whatever they want
[3564.68 → 3566.68] Uh, I might not like it
[3566.68 → 3569.68] But that would just incite people to use other platforms more if they abuse it
[3569.68 → 3570.68] So just do that
[3570.68 → 3572.68] Again, it's an it's a private company
[3572.68 → 3574.68] You do have the freedom to use other things if you would like to
[3574.68 → 3575.68] Yeah
[3575.68 → 3578.68] Um, hopefully they don't take it much further than this
[3579.68 → 3581.68] Trying to stop people from becoming terrorists
[3582.68 → 3584.68] Heck yeah, super down with that
[3584.68 → 3587.68] Trying to stop people from using edge browser
[3587.68 → 3588.68] Eh
[3592.68 → 3594.68] And that's the WAN show for today
[3595.68 → 3597.68] Thank you guys for tuning in
[3597.68 → 3598.68] We will see you again next week
[3599.68 → 3600.68] Same bat time
[3600.68 → 3601.68] Well no, let's not actually leave yet
[3601.68 → 3602.68] Oh
[3602.68 → 3603.68] There are two things that we still have to do
[3603.68 → 3604.68] What do we have to do?
[3604.68 → 3607.68] One, I'm recruiting for Float plane if you want to be a developer
[3608.68 → 3609.68] And you want to come join us
[3609.68 → 3610.68] I've got stuff stuck on my team
[3610.68 → 3613.68] There's a video on our Facebook page and on our Twitter right now
[3613.68 → 3614.68] I'll post it
[3614.68 → 3615.68] And on Float plane if you want to see it
[3615.68 → 3620.68] Unfortunately, I am looking specifically for Canadians
[3620.68 → 3623.68] Or Americans who have a degree in a highly related field
[3623.68 → 3625.68] Like computer science
[3625.68 → 3627.68] Or like software engineering
[3627.68 → 3629.68] It has to be very directly related
[3630.68 → 3632.68] That is because of like immigration law and all this kind of stuff
[3632.68 → 3634.68] We have already picked up two guys
[3635.68 → 3637.68] That don't fit within that realm
[3638.68 → 3640.68] And it's been a problem trying to get them into Canada
[3640.68 → 3641.68] And trying to keep them employed
[3641.68 → 3644.68] Because Canada doesn't want you to have people who are employed
[3644.68 → 3646.68] Who don't live in Canada
[3646.68 → 3648.68] When you don't have an office outside of Canada
[3648.68 → 3649.68] Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
[3649.68 → 3651.68] So we're trying to make this process a little bit easier
[3651.68 → 3655.68] And we're just going for Canadians or Americans with a full bachelor's degree
[3655.68 → 3657.68] That one's nice too
[3657.68 → 3659.68] Yeah, I was telling you earlier to try it out
[3659.68 → 3660.68] It's good
[3660.68 → 3661.68] They're new flavours, very good
[3661.68 → 3663.68] So yeah, if you're interested
[3663.68 → 3664.68] You want to apply
[3664.68 → 3665.68] Back and front end
[3665.68 → 3666.68] Check out those videos
[3666.68 → 3668.68] It goes into more specifics there
[3668.68 → 3670.68] About even what the heck Float plane is
[3670.68 → 3671.68] Employment, no!
[3671.68 → 3672.68] What you'd be doing
[3672.68 → 3673.68] Is that what people are doing now?
[3673.68 → 3674.68] Employees, no!
[3674.68 → 3675.68] Canada, no!
[3675.68 → 3676.68] Canada, no!
[3676.68 → 3677.68] Edge, no!
[3677.68 → 3679.68] Oh god, I love that
[3679.68 → 3681.68] I don't know why I love that so much, but I do
[3681.68 → 3683.68] Also, we should go over what's on Float plane right now
[3683.68 → 3684.68] Mmm!
[3684.68 → 3685.68] Right
[3685.68 → 3687.68] But you can't miss two weeks in a row
[3687.68 → 3688.68] That would be

[3704.68 → 3705.68] 30 seconds
[3705.68 → 3706.68] Fair
[3706.68 → 3708.68] Uh, shoot, that's not the
[3708.68 → 3709.68] That's the wrong one
[3709.68 → 3710.68] What am I even doing?
[3710.68 → 3713.68] I'm busy enjoying this jerky
[3715.68 → 3718.68] Hey, someone said Float plane, yes!
[3718.68 → 3721.68] I'll take that meme break

[3792.68 → 3794.68] Casino technology is found
[3794.68 → 3795.68] That's actually a pretty good episode
[3795.68 → 3796.68] It's been a little
[3796.68 → 3798.68] The comments on that have been interesting
[3798.68 → 3799.68] Because there's some people
[3799.68 → 3801.68] Feel quite strongly
[3801.68 → 3802.68] About casinos
[3802.68 → 3804.68] I didn't really expect that was going to be a thing
[3804.68 → 3805.68] Really? Why?
[3805.68 → 3806.68] Because of like gambling addiction and all this kind of stuff
[3806.68 → 3808.68] Yeah, what does that have to do with us though?
[3808.68 → 3809.68] I don't know
[3809.68 → 3810.68] It's been an interesting comment section
[3810.68 → 3811.68] Interesting
[3811.68 → 3815.68] That's not necessarily been pointed at us
[3815.68 → 3816.68] It should have been interesting
[3816.68 → 3818.68] Mezzanine update 11
[3818.68 → 3819.68] Is now here
[3819.68 → 3820.68] Yay
[3820.68 → 3822.68] Woo! Look at that

[3823.68 → 3824.68] It's actually coming along, yeah
[3824.68 → 3825.68] Mm hmm
[3825.68 → 3828.68] Five truly unusual graphics cards
[3828.68 → 3830.68] They truly are unusual
[3830.68 → 3834.68] I have to give us credit for titling this one very correctly
[3834.68 → 3835.68] That's a fan
[3835.68 → 3836.68] Oh
[3836.68 → 3837.68] Yeah
[3837.68 → 3839.68] That's unusual
[3839.68 → 3840.68] So that's a thing
[3840.68 → 3841.68] Yeah
[3841.68 → 3842.68] Yep
[3842.68 → 3845.68] The world's most amazing desk PC
[3845.68 → 3848.68] 16K gaming build log
[3849.68 → 3851.68] Dun dun dun
[3851.68 → 3852.68] See I
[3852.68 → 3855.68] I think you could have had an even cliquier title for that
[3856.68 → 3857.68] Um
[3857.68 → 3859.68] I don't think the interesting part there is the desk PC
[3859.68 → 3860.68] It's all the monitors
[3860.68 → 3861.68] I think the thumb
[3861.68 → 3863.68] Well that's the subject of this one
[3863.68 → 3865.68] Is actually building the desk PC
[3865.68 → 3867.68] And getting everything mounted
[3867.68 → 3868.68] So there's
[3868.68 → 3869.68] This is part one of two
[3869.68 → 3870.68] Oh
[3870.68 → 3872.68] So the other one focuses more on the monitors
[3872.68 → 3874.68] So part two might even do better
[3874.68 → 3879.68] Part two is the one that I expect to like beat 8K gaming
[3879.68 → 3880.68] Yeah okay
[3880.68 → 3881.68] Okay cool
[3881.68 → 3882.68] Um

[3899.68 → 3900.68] DJI Spark videos up
[3901.68 → 3902.68] Uh what else we got
[3902.68 → 3903.68] I think uh
[3903.68 → 3904.68] I think that might be it
[3904.68 → 3905.68] Oh this
[3905.68 → 3906.68] Project Orpheus

[3910.68 → 3911.68] So this was half of the joke

[3921.68 → 3924.68] It's so it's like 80% of the twitch debt right now
[3924.68 → 3926.68] So this was part of the joke
[3926.68 → 3928.68] When I said world's smallest SLI
[3928.68 → 3930.68] With those stupid USB drives
[3930.68 → 3931.68] Yeah
