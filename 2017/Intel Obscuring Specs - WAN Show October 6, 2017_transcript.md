[0.00 --> 11.78]  Okay, it is WAN show time again. It has been a very challenging three weeks. So I was talking to,
[11.78 --> 15.88]  I don't know, I was talking to a couple of people about it today because it was such an
[15.88 --> 20.32]  astonishing realization for me that I just had to share it with everybody.
[20.32 --> 30.08]  In the last three weeks, I have spent only six out of 15 days working on our daily content.
[30.74 --> 31.22]  Wow.
[31.92 --> 34.22]  Five days I was out for Tech Showdown.
[34.32 --> 34.52]  Yeah.
[35.00 --> 38.92]  Three days I've been basically out for ROG Rig Reboot.
[39.04 --> 39.26]  Yeah.
[39.64 --> 42.48]  And then one day I was out for Ultra Wide Festival.
[44.18 --> 47.02]  So you throw in a few WAN shows.
[47.46 --> 47.74]  Yeah.
[47.74 --> 53.92]  And I have actually had almost no time to work on our normal content.
[54.96 --> 59.06]  So on the one hand, it's great that we're getting any of it done.
[59.60 --> 60.32]  So that's cool.
[60.62 --> 67.18]  But on the other hand, I haven't actually gotten to goof around with tech in so long.
[68.52 --> 71.14]  Okay, the kinds of projects that I have on the go right now.
[71.14 --> 77.14]  Okay, I have a Threadripper IHS transplant to do.
[77.14 --> 80.52]  So I want to put the vanity Linus Tech Tips one on a working chip.
[80.62 --> 81.12]  Nice, yeah.
[81.14 --> 84.14]  Okay, so yeah, it's nice if I can ever do it.
[84.56 --> 86.32]  I want to break out the old chiller.
[86.70 --> 88.98]  Oh, I thought you were saying like these were things you were progressing on.
[89.00 --> 90.52]  And go, no, I'm making no progress.
[90.72 --> 91.84]  I want to go sub-zero.
[91.84 --> 97.98]  I want to do the final office update for the window TV.
[98.52 --> 98.96]  Okay, yeah.
[101.24 --> 101.86]  You know what?
[101.98 --> 103.14]  I should bring up Trello.
[103.50 --> 107.10]  I should have a look at all the other like crazy stuff that I'm supposed to be doing right now.
[107.10 --> 109.40]  See, I don't get to play with that kind of technology anymore.
[109.58 --> 113.44]  But like you need to change your handle, man.
[113.44 --> 115.18]  Xiaomi Mi Mix 2?
[115.88 --> 116.04]  Yeah.
[116.04 --> 117.60]  Okay, got to get my review done of that.
[117.86 --> 119.24]  Like look at the screen on this thing.
[119.68 --> 120.22]  It's upside down.
[120.50 --> 121.08]  Well, yeah.
[121.32 --> 121.76]  Wow.
[121.98 --> 122.40]  But look at that.
[122.66 --> 123.10]  The whole thing.
[123.20 --> 123.78]  The whole thing's a screen.
[124.16 --> 124.40]  Yeah.
[124.72 --> 125.02]  Basically.
[125.34 --> 125.54]  Yeah.
[125.78 --> 126.46]  And that's cool.
[126.72 --> 127.08]  Software.
[127.22 --> 127.84]  Software is terrible.
[128.26 --> 128.84]  Software is terrible.
[130.20 --> 131.12]  Software needs some work.
[131.78 --> 133.20]  I don't get to play with that kind of tech.
[133.38 --> 135.68]  But Boiler, I'm not going to say your whole handle.
[135.68 --> 137.40]  You need to figure out someone else.
[137.62 --> 142.88]  Dude has been like contributing to the sales open source, which is super cool.
[143.16 --> 144.68]  And some cool things have happened this week.
[144.76 --> 151.74]  We had that meeting thing, which I'm sure didn't help at all with your being able to work on content stuff.
[152.12 --> 154.30]  But float plane progress, right?
[154.64 --> 154.88]  Yeah.
[155.30 --> 155.48]  Yeah.
[157.04 --> 159.96]  Hopefully, dude, if you're out there, take the job.
[160.64 --> 161.30]  Come work with us.
[163.22 --> 163.66]  Yeah.
[164.02 --> 165.00]  That would be great.
[165.00 --> 169.00]  We need skilled developers.
[170.90 --> 171.04]  Yeah.
[171.56 --> 171.96]  Yeah.
[172.02 --> 172.82]  Other cool stuff.
[173.10 --> 174.52]  Most insane SSD setup.
[175.02 --> 178.32]  So six 960 Pros running in RAID 0.
[178.46 --> 178.78]  Nice.
[178.88 --> 179.42]  On Threadripper.
[179.70 --> 180.00]  Nice.
[180.36 --> 183.60]  Like, actually, that one progress is being made because Ivan's working on it.
[183.86 --> 185.38]  But anyway, the point is just there's...
[185.38 --> 190.92]  I think the most insane SSD setup is actually when that guy tied together like 50 of them like six years ago.
[191.74 --> 193.38]  So I'm just saying.
[194.00 --> 194.74]  I'm just saying.
[194.74 --> 201.04]  Like, you might have used newer technology, but like, you said SSD setup in general.
[201.04 --> 203.26]  So, like, just saying.
[205.94 --> 208.50]  Anyways, for news this week, we have a bunch of different stuff.
[208.62 --> 213.10]  One, NCIX Tech Tips is, like, gone?
[213.30 --> 214.54]  It's in limbo, that's for sure.
[214.66 --> 215.14]  For now?
[215.54 --> 215.88]  Mm-hmm.
[216.14 --> 216.96]  Maybe coming back?
[217.04 --> 220.72]  Google announces the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL.
[220.72 --> 226.02]  Uh, and Intel is renaming their Kaby Lake Pentiums.
[226.82 --> 227.02]  Because...
[227.02 --> 227.86]  It's super dumb.
[228.18 --> 229.56]  It's like the dumbest thing ever.
[230.52 --> 230.78]  Yeah.
[230.78 --> 232.08]  And, uh...
[232.08 --> 232.70]  Oh, right.
[232.76 --> 233.56]  We'll roll the intro now.
[234.20 --> 234.56]  Boop!
[234.56 --> 242.50]  It's interesting because we have a few pieces of Intel news in here, which has not been super common for a while.
[242.56 --> 243.44]  It's all been AMD news.
[243.56 --> 245.18]  But it's, like, not good stuff.
[245.18 --> 247.18]  Um...
[247.18 --> 248.18]  Um...
[248.18 --> 252.62]  You know, I actually probably wanted to talk about that.
[254.30 --> 254.66]  Because...
[254.66 --> 256.06]  Yeah, actually, you know what?
[256.08 --> 258.68]  Yeah, I do have some stuff to say about that.
[258.80 --> 259.90]  Are you going to talk about this, by the way?
[260.32 --> 260.86]  Um...
[260.86 --> 261.36]  Yeah, I will.
[261.52 --> 261.68]  Okay.
[262.44 --> 263.18]  Um...
[263.18 --> 264.48]  Are you doing anything?
[265.42 --> 266.32]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[266.38 --> 266.84]  Sorry, Max.
[266.92 --> 268.16]  I'll do that for you.
[268.28 --> 269.14]  I totally forgot.
[269.50 --> 272.76]  I remoted into my computer, and then I just didn't do it.
[272.76 --> 274.30]  I tried not locking your computer.
[274.30 --> 275.30]  Nope.
[276.18 --> 277.96]  My computer uses a real password.
[279.22 --> 280.06]  Yep, I know.
[280.06 --> 281.10]  Unlike everything else.
[284.36 --> 285.08]  Sorry, guys.
[285.14 --> 285.72]  Hold on a second.
[286.50 --> 287.62]  Okay, I just saved to V3.
[288.16 --> 288.94]  And you're good.
[289.30 --> 289.66]  Okay.
[290.98 --> 291.94]  All right.
[293.30 --> 295.14]  So, you know what?
[295.34 --> 296.94]  Why don't we tackle...
[298.04 --> 300.10]  Let's do the dumb Intel news first.
[300.22 --> 302.18]  And then let's do the dumb...
[302.18 --> 302.68]  Is there cool?
[302.68 --> 304.76]  Dumb reaction to Intel news.
[305.36 --> 308.44]  Because, like, honestly, I was pretty...
[308.44 --> 309.44]  Um...
[309.44 --> 318.18]  I was pretty frustrated with the community's reaction to certain aspects of Coffee Lake.
[318.52 --> 320.72]  And the launch and our review of it.
[320.78 --> 320.98]  Okay.
[320.98 --> 321.94]  Um...
[321.94 --> 322.26]  Because...
[322.26 --> 323.10]  I haven't looked into this.
[323.24 --> 323.86]  It was...
[323.86 --> 325.48]  It was pretty dumb.
[325.84 --> 326.02]  Uh...
[326.02 --> 326.98]  So, NumLock21.
[327.20 --> 328.02]  Posted on the forum.
[328.18 --> 330.22]  The original article here is from TechPowerUp.
[331.50 --> 331.90]  And...
[331.90 --> 332.90]  I'll get it in Twitch chat right now.
[333.50 --> 333.90]  Rats.
[334.54 --> 335.12]  Hold on.
[336.54 --> 337.26]  Um...
[337.26 --> 337.98]  Um...
[337.98 --> 338.98]  Um...
[339.78 --> 339.98]  Um...
[339.98 --> 340.98]  Um...
[340.98 --> 346.74]  Yeah!
[346.74 --> 346.94]  Yeah!
[347.74 --> 348.66]  All right.
[349.74 --> 356.68]  Intel to rebrand Pentium as Pentium Gold.
[357.44 --> 357.90]  Oh.
[358.56 --> 359.28]  Oh.
[359.74 --> 361.22]  Oh, yes.
[361.74 --> 362.86]  Ah, yes!
[363.62 --> 364.62]  Wait, why?
[364.62 --> 365.18]  Okay.
[365.38 --> 368.54]  So, it's all part of, like, an overarching stupid thing.
[368.60 --> 368.82]  Hold on.
[368.86 --> 371.18]  I'm just gonna turn the apertures, uh...
[371.18 --> 371.50]  More...
[371.50 --> 372.56]  More open a bit.
[372.68 --> 373.04]  One second.
[373.36 --> 373.70]  What?
[373.80 --> 374.70]  I'm so confused.
[374.80 --> 375.92]  Is this only for the high...
[375.92 --> 376.36]  Oh.
[378.26 --> 378.66]  Sorry.
[378.76 --> 379.46]  One second, guys.
[379.64 --> 380.58]  This is kind of silly.
[381.86 --> 382.12]  Okay.
[382.28 --> 383.08]  I think we just needed...
[383.08 --> 384.06]  So, low-power...
[384.06 --> 384.48]  We just needed more aperture.
[384.74 --> 389.22]  Low-power Gemini Lake SoCs will bear the Pentium Silver brand.
[390.82 --> 391.86]  Besides Celeron.
[391.86 --> 394.50]  Is there Pentium Bronze?
[394.84 --> 396.40]  I don't see a Pentium Bronze.
[397.58 --> 400.44]  So, there's Pentium Silver and Pentium Gold.
[400.64 --> 403.86]  So, basically, as far as I can tell...
[404.92 --> 405.64]  Why are you chilling?
[406.48 --> 417.30]  Intel hired some kind of new, like, senior VP of branding or marketing or, like, product naming or whatever that position is.
[417.30 --> 420.52]  Where you actually make the decision about what to call the product.
[420.52 --> 423.16]  And they did the unthinkable.
[423.50 --> 427.34]  They managed to make Intel's naming scheme worse.
[428.04 --> 428.96]  It's impressive.
[429.32 --> 430.72]  You know, like, to give them props.
[430.98 --> 431.16]  Yeah.
[431.34 --> 432.24]  They found a way.
[432.58 --> 433.06]  Because...
[433.06 --> 433.82]  They had the will.
[433.96 --> 434.64]  They had...
[434.64 --> 435.30]  Intel...
[435.30 --> 436.08]  They were determined.
[436.20 --> 438.90]  Intel hasn't named for a consumer.
[439.14 --> 439.34]  Okay?
[439.42 --> 442.88]  Like, I'm not talking about, you know, Zeon or Itanium.
[443.74 --> 444.30]  Sculptrail.
[444.30 --> 445.98]  Itanium sounds pretty cool.
[446.14 --> 446.60]  Itanium does sound cool.
[446.60 --> 448.32]  The problem with Sculptrail is that it's a codename.
[448.72 --> 450.92]  Intel's codenames are so good.
[451.02 --> 451.22]  Yeah.
[451.40 --> 452.02]  A lot of the time.
[452.10 --> 452.76]  Sometimes they're dumb.
[453.54 --> 453.94]  Sculptrail.
[454.06 --> 455.04]  That was so cool.
[455.86 --> 456.26]  Bontrail.
[456.40 --> 457.22]  Oh, my God.
[457.28 --> 459.36]  I mean, even stuff like Alpine Ridge.
[459.62 --> 459.82]  Yeah.
[459.88 --> 461.12]  Like, that's pretty cool.
[461.22 --> 461.70]  It'd be like, yeah.
[461.80 --> 463.60]  I want, like, an Intel Alpine Ridge.
[464.16 --> 464.50]  Hell yeah.
[464.62 --> 465.94]  That's a Thunderbolt controller, by the way.
[466.02 --> 466.50]  It ended up...
[466.50 --> 468.12]  I mean, even Thunderbolt has a cool name.
[468.36 --> 469.92]  But on the CPU side, okay?
[470.42 --> 470.78]  So back...
[470.78 --> 471.80]  Go way back in the day.
[471.92 --> 473.66]  It was, like, the 286.
[473.72 --> 474.76]  And the 386.
[474.82 --> 476.04]  And the 486.
[476.08 --> 476.76]  And all that made sense.
[476.76 --> 478.56]  And I know there are numbers, but people remember this.
[478.56 --> 479.62]  You got your generation.
[480.18 --> 480.32]  Yeah.
[480.32 --> 482.18]  And you got your instruction set.
[482.26 --> 482.48]  Okay?
[483.46 --> 483.82]  X86.
[483.82 --> 484.40]  Pretty straightforward.
[485.20 --> 485.48]  Cool.
[485.98 --> 489.76]  Then they got to 5 and they were like, no, let's not do 586.
[490.00 --> 491.16]  Let's go Pentium.
[491.52 --> 492.20]  And you know what?
[492.40 --> 493.12]  Not bad.
[493.52 --> 498.16]  Maybe part of it is that Pentium has basically existed since I've, like, had a computer.
[498.50 --> 499.54]  Well, no, actually, that's not true.
[499.60 --> 502.76]  We had a 386 that we then upgraded to a 486.
[502.76 --> 503.98]  I can understand that change, though.
[504.08 --> 506.34]  You're going from slightly less ultra hardcore.
[506.60 --> 506.78]  Yeah.
[507.30 --> 508.26]  You're going...
[508.26 --> 511.00]  And then you go generations of Pentium.
[511.24 --> 511.48]  Okay?
[511.96 --> 512.96]  And then Celeron.
[512.96 --> 513.78]  I was like, yeah, sure.
[513.92 --> 514.18]  Okay.
[514.68 --> 515.12]  Celeron.
[515.22 --> 515.52]  Why not?
[516.20 --> 518.06]  Then came Core.
[519.82 --> 522.82]  What?
[524.32 --> 526.20]  If it was actually how many cores they had.
[526.34 --> 526.94]  Then sure.
[527.12 --> 527.34]  Yeah.
[527.64 --> 531.62]  So if a Core 2 was a dual core.
[531.88 --> 532.10]  Yeah.
[532.58 --> 534.70]  But yeah, but then you're backed into a corner.
[534.82 --> 537.84]  Because what are you going to call the next generation?
[538.20 --> 540.32]  You would have to call it the Core 2 2.
[540.52 --> 541.74]  Do you remember Core 2 Quad, though?
[541.74 --> 545.06]  Yes, Core 2 Duo, Core 2 Quad.
[545.36 --> 546.80]  So you would have to say...
[546.80 --> 548.30]  I mean, you still have to do it.
[548.48 --> 553.74]  You would have to say, yeah, I've got an Intel Core 2 Duo dual core CP...
[554.88 --> 558.74]  Bad.
[559.44 --> 559.92]  No.
[559.92 --> 565.58]  And then you got these indecipherable numbers at the end of them.
[565.68 --> 570.22]  And in Intel's defense, there is a legend on their site for how to decipher them.
[570.34 --> 570.50]  Yeah.
[571.20 --> 575.68]  But, you know, many of the numbers, like, never ended up getting incremented at all.
[575.86 --> 578.22]  So they might as well have just not had them.
[578.22 --> 581.94]  And Intel plans out their product roadmap so far in advance.
[582.08 --> 589.36]  Like, do they really need to leave, you know, like a 50 there just in case they need to use it?
[589.52 --> 591.06]  Like, they never do it.
[591.94 --> 593.02]  So anyway, anyway.
[593.18 --> 594.90]  So we've been stuck with Core.
[595.36 --> 597.90]  Core i3, Core i5, Core i7 for a long time.
[597.92 --> 606.70]  And then at least Core i9 made sense in the sense that it was a continuation of something that's been established over the last 10 years.
[606.70 --> 610.82]  If you want to show off how ridiculous this is, just show our Intel naming videos on TechWiki.
[611.14 --> 611.40]  Yeah.
[611.54 --> 613.36]  I think it's got, like, 6 million views.
[613.96 --> 620.68]  Like, what is Core i7 videos?
[623.04 --> 623.44]  Yeah.
[623.72 --> 624.24]  Hold on here.
[624.26 --> 624.88]  We'll bring this up.
[626.72 --> 627.48]  7 million.
[627.66 --> 629.74]  Like, it keeps on trucking, this one.
[630.50 --> 633.78]  What is a Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7 as fast as possible?
[633.92 --> 634.04]  Yeah.
[634.12 --> 635.38]  7 million freaking views.
[635.38 --> 636.84]  What is a Core i9?
[636.90 --> 638.54]  That's got a million since three months ago.
[638.66 --> 642.28]  Like, people, like, clearly understand it a little better now than they used to.
[642.58 --> 647.20]  But at least Core i9 had the advantage of continuity.
[647.62 --> 650.32]  And I think people aren't shopping for it as much.
[651.00 --> 651.66]  It's too expensive.
[651.76 --> 654.66]  And the other issue, too, though, is that they did kind of screw it up.
[654.66 --> 657.44]  Because if Core i9 had simply been high-end desktop.
[658.22 --> 658.64]  Yeah.
[659.00 --> 659.58]  Then, sure.
[659.72 --> 664.92]  But they've got Core i7s and Core i5s on the same platform.
[664.92 --> 666.40]  And, oh, man.
[666.40 --> 666.42]  And, oh, man.
[667.94 --> 668.38]  7740K.
[668.70 --> 669.20]  Or X?
[669.26 --> 669.82]  Is it an X?
[669.86 --> 670.60]  I can't even remember.
[670.70 --> 671.10]  But whatever.
[671.78 --> 678.88]  The, like, the Kaby Lake chips on X299, they were super dumb when X299 launched.
[679.20 --> 683.26]  Now, they are, like, super, super mega ultra dumb.
[683.82 --> 686.28]  Because now that Coffee Lake has launched.
[688.34 --> 688.74]  7740X.
[688.82 --> 693.08]  You would only be buying one of those if you were just a complete idiot.
[693.58 --> 698.80]  Or you were a professional overclocker looking for, like, per core records or something.
[698.80 --> 701.88]  Because Coffee Lake is overclocking pretty well.
[701.98 --> 702.64]  5 gigahertz.
[702.80 --> 704.04]  It looks pretty attainable.
[704.54 --> 708.72]  And not just for, like, people who are sorting through trays of CPUs.
[708.74 --> 709.38]  So that's pretty cool.
[709.44 --> 709.70]  Anyway.
[710.58 --> 711.36]  Coming back to Pentium.
[711.36 --> 716.22]  So they brought back the Pentium brand after having gotten rid of it for many years.
[716.40 --> 718.90]  And they assigned it to their cheapo products.
[719.44 --> 720.04]  And I was kind of like.
[721.42 --> 723.38]  Like, that feels a little bit like.
[723.86 --> 724.64]  It's kind of sad.
[724.96 --> 725.20]  Yeah.
[725.24 --> 728.16]  It's, like, reusing what used to be, like, top of the line.
[728.24 --> 729.20]  Like, cream of the cream.
[729.62 --> 732.66]  And, like, going for, like, a nostalgia sale to someone who.
[733.20 --> 738.30]  Like, I guess in the sense it's, like, if it's competitive with Intel's, like, old CPUs.
[738.30 --> 742.78]  Like, you'd have to be running something old enough to be a Pentium for it to be an upgrade.
[742.94 --> 743.16]  Right.
[743.34 --> 744.36]  Maybe that was the rationale.
[744.52 --> 745.06]  I don't know.
[745.38 --> 745.82]  That's fine.
[746.94 --> 748.12]  Like, at least they didn't.
[748.70 --> 751.98]  At least they didn't pull an AMD where they brought back the FX branding.
[752.36 --> 752.68]  Oh.
[752.84 --> 756.46]  For, like, a super, super mainstream product.
[756.46 --> 758.92]  Because remember, guys.
[759.32 --> 760.24]  Or maybe not remember.
[760.38 --> 761.90]  Like, I'm going to let you know, young people.
[762.50 --> 764.20]  FX used to be $1,000.
[764.56 --> 764.74]  Yeah.
[764.88 --> 765.06]  Period.
[765.42 --> 767.52]  You didn't buy an FX for less than $1,000.
[767.84 --> 768.18]  That was it.
[768.24 --> 768.96]  It was the cream of the cream.
[769.42 --> 777.32]  And then they brought back FX as, like, super ultra mega rebranded stuff we had.
[779.08 --> 779.94]  It sounds cool.
[780.02 --> 780.88]  So it might sell some stuff.
[780.96 --> 781.20]  Yeah.
[781.28 --> 781.66]  Exactly.
[781.66 --> 785.88]  So anyway, back to gold.
[787.12 --> 794.68]  As far as I can tell, Intel brought in some kind of rebranding executive who renamed all
[794.68 --> 802.82]  these Zeons according to this bronze, silver, gold, platinum naming scheme.
[803.64 --> 807.62]  And it makes no sense at all.
[807.72 --> 810.78]  I'd love to see internal numbers to see if anything changed when they did that.
[810.78 --> 811.60]  No, of course not.
[812.14 --> 812.54]  Oh, I know.
[812.86 --> 815.88]  But, like, I would like to be able to represent my argument with facts.
[815.90 --> 817.24]  And it's so confusing.
[817.38 --> 823.14]  Because, again, Intel's server products, the product names were a little confusing.
[823.38 --> 826.76]  Like something, like a 2687W.
[827.50 --> 829.68]  But you need such specific things.
[829.98 --> 830.18]  Yeah.
[830.26 --> 831.44]  It doesn't really matter if it's confusing.
[831.52 --> 832.44]  You're going to arc them all anyways.
[832.44 --> 836.92]  And if you know what a W is, a W is like a high power workstationship.
[837.10 --> 837.82]  Then you'd know.
[837.90 --> 844.38]  It's not going to have the same, like, max core count as the ones that are designed for, like, tons of virtualization or whatever else.
[844.38 --> 846.36]  And it's going to have, like, higher boost clocks.
[846.42 --> 847.36]  It's probably got a higher TDP.
[847.48 --> 850.18]  Like, you could kind of piece it together if you were somewhat familiar with the lineup.
[850.18 --> 858.60]  Now, like, a gold could be a high performance SKU that fits in this socket or that one or, like, this dual platform one.
[858.64 --> 860.18]  It has to do with, like, the raw performance.
[860.34 --> 862.14]  But the features get left behind.
[862.14 --> 867.28]  And so now we're just, like, going to just tack gold onto stuff.
[869.34 --> 871.62]  Like, I just, it's just frustrating.
[872.88 --> 878.56]  So the name change comes with a refreshed case badge and a slightly modified box design.
[879.18 --> 881.90]  And it will be effective November 2, 2017.
[882.16 --> 888.26]  So basically, gold, which is, I don't want to say always tacky, but.
[888.56 --> 889.76]  It's pretty much always tacky.
[889.80 --> 890.88]  Usually tacky.
[890.88 --> 894.74]  Unless it's a rank in a competitive video game, it's tacky.
[895.44 --> 896.62]  Well, now, hold on.
[896.86 --> 899.22]  Gold and black can look pretty good.
[899.46 --> 901.08]  I mean as, like, a product naming thing.
[901.34 --> 902.56]  Oh, oh, yeah, that.
[902.66 --> 904.66]  No, that, like, how dead is that?
[904.88 --> 908.28]  Like, when's the last time anyone did, like, bronze, silver, gold?
[908.52 --> 909.92]  You can use gold tastefully.
[910.04 --> 911.60]  It just has to be used properly.
[911.70 --> 916.42]  Like, remember when we were doing the support tiers on the forum, which, incidentally, are bronze, silver, and gold?
[917.04 --> 918.94]  We were talking about it, and I was just like, you know what?
[918.96 --> 920.40]  I just don't have time to think about this.
[920.40 --> 921.84]  Let's just do bronze, silver, and gold.
[923.86 --> 924.54]  But, like.
[925.20 --> 926.66]  But, Intel, what's your excuse?
[927.12 --> 928.86]  I think ours is also pretty easy.
[929.04 --> 932.60]  There isn't any confusing, like, it doesn't actually follow the features.
[932.74 --> 934.02]  It only follows raw performance.
[934.14 --> 934.58]  Like, no.
[935.08 --> 937.56]  There's really not much else you get.
[937.74 --> 937.90]  Yeah.
[937.90 --> 939.52]  You get a different colored badge.
[939.58 --> 940.96]  You get access to a better forum.
[941.08 --> 942.06]  Thank you for your contribution.
[942.22 --> 943.30]  That's ultimately what it is.
[944.58 --> 944.98]  So.
[945.78 --> 946.66]  Not a better forum.
[946.86 --> 948.40]  Everything happens in the bronze forum.
[948.92 --> 949.56]  Spoiler alert.
[949.78 --> 950.02]  Yeah.
[950.02 --> 955.02]  There's a counting to 10,000 thread in the bronze forum, and the silver and gold forums are pretty much cobwebs.
[955.02 --> 965.14]  Hey, do you guys want to get some really cool insight into the way that YouTube does or doesn't deliver video notifications to subscribers?
[966.18 --> 967.26]  This is pretty cool.
[967.26 --> 968.64]  So, hold on.
[968.70 --> 972.58]  I'm actually going to load up another tab here to give you guys some context for this.
[972.90 --> 973.50]  This is pretty cool.
[973.86 --> 977.10]  And I have some good Intel news in a moment here.
[977.38 --> 979.16]  But, here, let's go ahead.
[979.22 --> 981.10]  Let's bring up some analytics for this bad boy.
[982.76 --> 984.94]  Surprisingly, a lot of people said no.
[985.80 --> 986.30]  About what?
[986.70 --> 987.74]  Wanting to see this.
[988.56 --> 988.82]  Really?
[988.98 --> 991.10]  There was definitely quite a few people that said yes as well.
[991.30 --> 991.50]  Okay.
[992.06 --> 992.62]  Well, whatever.
[992.74 --> 993.18]  It's cool.
[993.30 --> 993.76]  You'll like it.
[993.82 --> 994.32]  It's probably trolls.
[994.32 --> 997.74]  So, here's the dashboard for one of our recent releases.
[998.06 --> 1003.82]  So, you can have a look at what a video might typically do in the first hour.
[1005.06 --> 1009.44]  So, this is our Core i7 8700K review.
[1010.26 --> 1012.26]  Sitting at 690,000 views.
[1012.46 --> 1016.68]  And in the first hour, it did about 84,000 followed by 72,000.
[1016.94 --> 1018.26]  This is a weird launch time.
[1018.36 --> 1020.80]  So, this decay curve looks a little bit different than it normally would.
[1020.86 --> 1022.86]  But it's also not totally atypical.
[1023.00 --> 1023.14]  Yeah.
[1023.56 --> 1024.18]  All right.
[1024.32 --> 1026.02]  So, in the last 60 minutes...
[1026.02 --> 1026.12]  Nine.
[1026.74 --> 1026.96]  Woo!
[1027.42 --> 1028.16]  There goes a fly.
[1028.38 --> 1030.48]  It did about 3,400 views.
[1030.66 --> 1031.64]  Oh, you guys can't see that.
[1031.72 --> 1031.90]  Whatever.
[1032.04 --> 1032.92]  Take my word for it.
[1032.94 --> 1034.12]  3,400 views or so.
[1034.24 --> 1034.44]  Okay.
[1035.08 --> 1039.82]  So, YouTube's algorithm is so...
[1039.82 --> 1041.28]  I don't want to use the word smart.
[1041.70 --> 1042.00]  Damn.
[1042.00 --> 1059.24]  But what I'll say is it is so aggressive about targeting content that it thinks might be me trying to use my subscriber base as a way to communicate with the people that watch Linus Tech Tips.
[1059.24 --> 1060.94]  It's so sensitive to that.
[1060.94 --> 1061.64]  It's so sensitive to that.
[1061.64 --> 1062.94]  That check this out.
[1062.94 --> 1066.04]  The WAN show stream announcement video.
[1066.04 --> 1072.24]  I specifically uploaded at the same time every week with the same title every week.
[1072.24 --> 1083.08]  And YouTube's algorithm has got this thing crushed to the point where in the first hour, it is probably going to do like...
[1083.08 --> 1084.20]  Let's see.
[1084.28 --> 1085.88]  We're only doing about 140 views.
[1085.88 --> 1088.36]  It's like a length of an hour, I think.
[1088.54 --> 1088.74]  Yeah.
[1089.12 --> 1090.30]  Something along those lines.
[1090.44 --> 1095.76]  It has only managed to do about 3,600 views in the last 20 minutes or so.
[1096.70 --> 1097.82]  Pretty crazy, hey?
[1097.84 --> 1098.40]  That's nuts.
[1098.58 --> 1100.04]  So, you see...
[1100.04 --> 1100.54]  Okay.
[1100.66 --> 1101.96]  This is an extreme example.
[1102.26 --> 1103.30]  And this is something where...
[1103.30 --> 1103.76]  You know what?
[1104.60 --> 1107.16]  Quite honestly, I could name it something else.
[1107.62 --> 1113.42]  And that would help more people get notifications for it.
[1113.42 --> 1123.88]  But intentionally, I'm feeding into the algorithm here, allowing the algorithm to take the people who aren't interested in WAN show and just not pump them a notification.
[1124.10 --> 1127.28]  Like, I'm okay with that because we just do it because we've always done it.
[1127.70 --> 1131.28]  And if it boosts the live viewers a little bit, then, like, great.
[1131.34 --> 1131.90]  They know we're live.
[1131.94 --> 1132.36]  That's cool.
[1132.66 --> 1136.98]  For the people that do rely on that notification, if we don't put it up, some people do miss the WAN show.
[1138.56 --> 1139.76]  But what this is is...
[1139.76 --> 1141.50]  I think there's also a fair amount of this, to be clear.
[1141.50 --> 1147.16]  I'm gladmax1 in the chat said, I see the YouTube video, I ignore it, and I hit the Twitch bookmark.
[1147.50 --> 1149.72]  So that might be part of why it gets buried.
[1150.28 --> 1150.96]  Either way.
[1151.34 --> 1155.60]  But that's one of the reasons that we continue to do it, just in case people are lying on it.
[1155.60 --> 1168.70]  But this is an extreme example of the way that YouTube does manipulate the way that it propagates new video information to someone who is subscribed.
[1170.70 --> 1172.70]  And it's one of those things that's frustrating.
[1172.82 --> 1174.82]  It's one of the reasons that we're starting Floatplane.
[1174.94 --> 1178.22]  And I was just kind of inspired to talk about it for some reason.
[1178.30 --> 1179.24]  I don't remember why anymore.
[1179.24 --> 1181.16]  But we can move on to our next topic.
[1183.44 --> 1184.16]  Alright.
[1185.16 --> 1192.60]  So I was actually a little disappointed in our viewers' reaction to the Coffee Lake video.
[1192.60 --> 1208.26]  There was an astonishing amount of ignorance in some of the comments with respect to how we would have manipulated what benchmarks we used.
[1208.52 --> 1211.88]  And the problem is that the arguments just don't even make any sense.
[1211.88 --> 1216.50]  Like someone was upset that we didn't include the Ryzen 7 1800X.
[1217.32 --> 1221.30]  As though we were trying to conceal AMD's superiority.
[1222.18 --> 1224.32]  And we didn't want AMD to seem like a better value.
[1224.72 --> 1226.80]  The 1800X is not a very good value.
[1226.80 --> 1229.56]  The best value Ryzen 7 is the 1700.
[1233.70 --> 1235.18]  This 1800X is what?
[1235.28 --> 1237.64]  Like 200 MHz higher than the 1700X?
[1237.64 --> 1248.28]  How would that hurt AMD's value prop to throw in a processor that costs $100 more and clock 200 MHz higher?
[1248.82 --> 1255.54]  How are we hurting AMD's appearance of value by choosing one of their chips that is a better value?
[1256.44 --> 1258.78]  Now one thing that we didn't discuss in our video.
[1258.92 --> 1261.62]  And honestly the funny thing is this like barely even came up.
[1261.62 --> 1272.58]  People are so fixated on comparisons that they don't like and or don't understand or whatever else that they didn't even notice this one.
[1273.22 --> 1276.66]  What we should have discussed was some of the differences in platform cost.
[1276.84 --> 1280.40]  Like the fact that a B350 board is cheaper than a Z370 board.
[1280.40 --> 1293.66]  But just the number of people that are like when we release a video that's positive about Intel they're like wow you guys sure changed your tune so fast about being sponsored by them.
[1294.32 --> 1294.66]  No.
[1295.10 --> 1301.86]  We changed our tune because they released a different product that's different than the one we said we didn't like.
[1301.86 --> 1312.52]  It's called looking at what's in front of you and evaluating it instead of just going in having already decided the answer.
[1319.04 --> 1319.68]  Yeah.
[1319.68 --> 1330.36]  Is it like is it as bad as the oh my god they didn't benchmark with wow why can't I think of the name of it right now?
[1331.08 --> 1332.24]  Future of OpenGL.
[1333.10 --> 1333.46]  Vulkan?
[1334.46 --> 1337.38]  Um yeah hard to say.
[1337.80 --> 1338.86]  Hard to say.
[1339.34 --> 1340.14]  But anyway.
[1341.22 --> 1346.76]  Yeah apparently we're doing damage control over Intel forcing customers to buy a new motherboard on the same socket.
[1346.76 --> 1348.92]  I wonder how much Intel paid him for this.
[1348.92 --> 1349.92]  Nothing.
[1350.16 --> 1350.44]  Nice.
[1350.72 --> 1353.24]  So the way that that works.
[1353.24 --> 1354.10]  Grade A 10 out of 10 comment.
[1354.18 --> 1358.00]  And unfortunately I can't get anyone to go on the record about it.
[1358.40 --> 1360.58]  Um so I can't say who my source is.
[1360.92 --> 1368.66]  But what happened was Intel designed their platform for two generations of CPUs the same way they have for the last 10 years.
[1370.66 --> 1371.52]  That's how it went.
[1371.64 --> 1372.66]  That's how it goes down.
[1372.80 --> 1373.80]  You cannot like it.
[1374.12 --> 1375.62]  And that's totally cool.
[1375.62 --> 1376.96]  And I totally get it.
[1376.96 --> 1380.00]  Um but they designed it for two generations.
[1380.00 --> 1383.50]  They did not design it for a six core processor.
[1383.50 --> 1387.56]  And there were physical things that were redesigned.
[1388.56 --> 1391.28]  Could Intel have made it work?
[1391.48 --> 1396.98]  Off the record I've got indications that they might have been able to.
[1397.84 --> 1399.66]  In fact probably could have.
[1399.66 --> 1406.42]  But would it have been a janky solution that might not have had the reliability that Intel's known for?
[1406.98 --> 1408.22]  In all likelihood yes.
[1409.28 --> 1412.76]  So was this partially a marketing decision?
[1413.02 --> 1413.50]  Possibly.
[1413.50 --> 1421.58]  Personally I'm pretty annoyed that a Z370 for example cannot hold a Skylake or a Kaby Lake chip.
[1421.98 --> 1428.24]  But I totally understand why Intel wouldn't want to put their stellar reputation for reliability on the line.
[1428.46 --> 1436.48]  By allowing you to put a new Coffee Lake chip in your Z270 board without having fully validated it.
[1436.48 --> 1438.44]  And here's another thing you guys have to understand.
[1439.18 --> 1450.80]  Just because Intel has a spec and just because like it should work doesn't mean that every motherboard manufacturer out there built properly to the spec.
[1451.44 --> 1454.44]  It doesn't mean that every SKU will work.
[1455.18 --> 1461.48]  And when you're someone like Intel if you say it's going to work it is supposed to work.
[1461.48 --> 1468.96]  Yeah and like building to spec a lot of the times you make product differentiation by finding ways to not build to spec.
[1469.54 --> 1476.80]  You end up making a lot more people mad by trying to accommodate them sometimes than you do by just going nope forget it.
[1477.20 --> 1477.82]  It doesn't work.
[1478.20 --> 1482.74]  Because something that you guys are probably missing here you look at the motivation you go well it's probably money grabbing.
[1483.18 --> 1486.24]  So let's look at something like Intel Optane which they opted.
[1488.24 --> 1488.80]  Wow.
[1488.80 --> 1494.28]  Which they opted to support on only Z270 was it if I recall correctly?
[1495.14 --> 1495.74]  Optane on.
[1495.74 --> 1496.82]  It's been a while since I've been on WAN.
[1497.00 --> 1497.64]  That was painful.
[1497.88 --> 1498.64]  Yeah I'm sorry.
[1498.86 --> 1499.02]  Oh.
[1500.28 --> 1501.96]  Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
[1503.30 --> 1504.92]  Optane I'm looking to upgrade.
[1505.34 --> 1507.52]  Upgrade using essentially an M.2.
[1508.04 --> 1509.00]  I want to know if not.
[1509.02 --> 1510.52]  It's like I lost my pun tolerance.
[1511.22 --> 1515.48]  Okay I think it is only 200 series.
[1515.48 --> 1518.96]  Blah blah blah blah blah blah.
[1519.64 --> 1523.74]  Hold on there's a there's a thing on Puget Optane.
[1524.32 --> 1525.36]  Yeah okay cool.
[1525.76 --> 1527.36]  So it's only supported on Z270.
[1527.66 --> 1530.30]  So the reason for that it's just an M.2 stick.
[1530.58 --> 1531.48]  That's all it is.
[1531.56 --> 1533.94]  It's an SSD using the M.2 standard.
[1534.50 --> 1537.90]  So feasibly Intel could have supported it on Z170.
[1538.42 --> 1543.50]  And a lot of people might look at this and go well their motivation must be money grubbing.
[1543.84 --> 1545.70]  They just want me to run out and buy a new motherboard.
[1546.42 --> 1551.74]  Do you really think anyone at Intel is stupid enough to think that anybody's going to go buy a new motherboard for Optane?
[1551.74 --> 1555.68]  If you had enough money to buy a new motherboard you would buy a boot SSD.
[1555.92 --> 1557.06]  You'd buy a dedicated SSD.
[1557.32 --> 1558.80]  Optane is a value solution.
[1559.46 --> 1560.84]  It's not money grubbing.
[1561.02 --> 1565.50]  If they were money grubbing they would shoehorn in the support.
[1566.06 --> 1567.48]  Not validate it fully.
[1567.86 --> 1569.24]  And just let people buy it.
[1569.40 --> 1570.40]  And if it works it works.
[1570.48 --> 1571.38]  And if it doesn't it doesn't.
[1571.60 --> 1572.18]  Like Ubisoft.
[1572.88 --> 1576.36]  Because the reason that they decided not to support it on Z170.
[1576.52 --> 1576.92]  And this is.
[1577.04 --> 1578.46]  I'm not going to quote my source.
[1578.92 --> 1579.82]  This is kind of off the record.
[1579.90 --> 1581.76]  I'm actually not even sure if I should be talking about it.
[1581.96 --> 1584.50]  Was that depending on the implementation.
[1586.16 --> 1589.32]  And you got to remember this isn't just like enthusiasts.
[1589.80 --> 1592.04]  You know gaming boards or whatever.
[1592.16 --> 1596.24]  This is across the like Dells and Acer's and Lenovo's of the world.
[1596.24 --> 1602.40]  The implementation on Z170 of M.2 might not have been up to snuff.
[1602.62 --> 1607.90]  And they can't rely on these guys to roll out UEFI BIOS updates to build in the support.
[1608.06 --> 1609.54]  Because that would be required.
[1609.76 --> 1612.68]  So it would end up being a very confusing message.
[1614.22 --> 1619.16]  If they wanted to sell more units they would want a wider install base of supported products.
[1619.70 --> 1620.06]  Duh.
[1620.78 --> 1621.78]  Don't you think?
[1623.66 --> 1624.54]  So anyway.
[1624.54 --> 1628.82]  I'm not necessarily happy about everything they did here.
[1628.96 --> 1632.00]  But you also have to understand that it's not always as simple as like.
[1632.48 --> 1633.54]  They're bad people.
[1633.74 --> 1634.62]  And they just want your money.
[1635.12 --> 1636.08]  They do just want your money.
[1636.18 --> 1636.68]  They're a business.
[1637.24 --> 1638.50]  But also understand.
[1638.64 --> 1639.16]  So does AMD.
[1639.70 --> 1640.48]  So does Nvidia.
[1641.04 --> 1642.12]  None of them are your friends.
[1645.54 --> 1646.02]  Um.
[1647.44 --> 1647.86]  Right.
[1647.98 --> 1651.60]  That was going to bring us really well into the whole off spec thing.
[1651.60 --> 1652.60]  Okay.
[1652.60 --> 1652.66]  Okay.
[1652.66 --> 1656.54]  Why are people getting different Coffee Lake performance results?
[1656.76 --> 1660.52]  So this was inspired by a tweet from Jay's Two Cents.
[1660.60 --> 1663.04]  And was originally posted on the forum by.
[1663.34 --> 1663.52]  Oh.
[1663.70 --> 1663.98]  Dang it.
[1664.04 --> 1664.46]  There's no.
[1664.68 --> 1666.58]  There's no who posted it on the forum thing.
[1666.66 --> 1667.10]  James.
[1669.02 --> 1669.46]  Um.
[1669.46 --> 1671.34]  Was originally posted on the forum by.
[1671.34 --> 1674.20]  Oh man.
[1675.42 --> 1675.70]  Oh.
[1675.84 --> 1676.00]  Oh.
[1676.04 --> 1677.78]  This was just a discussion in our own thread.
[1677.94 --> 1678.18]  Okay.
[1678.24 --> 1678.62]  Well fine.
[1678.70 --> 1679.20]  Fine James.
[1679.72 --> 1679.90]  Uh.
[1679.90 --> 1680.64]  But here's Jay's.
[1681.04 --> 1681.76]  Here's Jay's tweet.
[1682.22 --> 1682.40]  Yeah.
[1682.48 --> 1683.74]  I showed that in Twitch chat too.
[1683.88 --> 1684.04]  Cool.
[1684.04 --> 1688.46]  So you can see that our number and Jay's number are pretty close.
[1688.66 --> 1688.80]  Yeah.
[1689.00 --> 1691.56]  But then Paul's is a chunk down.
[1691.86 --> 1694.10]  And then Kyle's is even further down from that.
[1694.18 --> 1695.40]  And there's a lot of differentiation.
[1695.66 --> 1696.96]  This is a significant difference.
[1697.08 --> 1697.40]  Oh yeah.
[1697.40 --> 1700.72]  With us and Jay sitting around the 1500-50 range.
[1701.24 --> 1705.90]  And Paul and Kyle being in the 1400s and 1200s.
[1706.62 --> 1708.42]  So one of the theories.
[1709.90 --> 1710.54]  And this was.
[1710.74 --> 1713.68]  Kyle's chip compared to Jay's chip is almost a 300 point difference.
[1713.68 --> 1713.90]  Yeah.
[1714.04 --> 1714.62]  And that is a.
[1714.70 --> 1716.08]  That is a massive.
[1716.08 --> 1716.52]  That's huge.
[1716.58 --> 1717.48]  Difference in Cinebench.
[1717.84 --> 1718.40]  That's like.
[1718.60 --> 1718.90]  You know.
[1718.94 --> 1722.00]  One of your cores isn't working level of difference in Cinebench.
[1722.60 --> 1723.04]  So.
[1723.04 --> 1723.42]  Um.
[1724.14 --> 1725.00]  I can't.
[1725.08 --> 1727.14]  I can't believe he goes by Gabe N Jr.
[1727.28 --> 1727.80]  On the forum.
[1728.86 --> 1729.38]  But.
[1730.34 --> 1730.86]  Anyway.
[1731.02 --> 1732.46]  Anthony from our team.
[1732.94 --> 1733.26]  Uh.
[1733.26 --> 1738.20]  Was talking about how Gamers Nexus had found that their gigabyte board was giving them less voltage than specified.
[1738.96 --> 1739.44]  And.
[1739.86 --> 1743.20]  He was wondering if maybe ASUS did the same thing in the opposite direction.
[1743.20 --> 1745.36]  To give us better results.
[1745.92 --> 1746.36]  So.
[1746.84 --> 1748.56]  It seems like there's a known issue.
[1749.60 --> 1754.12]  That has to do with the boards not being fully tuned for coffee lake yet.
[1754.30 --> 1757.06]  Where the voltage is being applied might be affecting performance.
[1757.52 --> 1761.26]  So we actually have a review coming on the MSI Vortex G25.
[1761.26 --> 1763.96]  Where our original script.
[1763.96 --> 1764.68]  Um.
[1764.68 --> 1766.78]  That I reviewed with Alex a couple of days ago.
[1766.98 --> 1769.92]  Had this comment on how when we stress tested it.
[1770.24 --> 1771.26]  It would run at.
[1771.26 --> 1771.56]  Oh.
[1771.64 --> 1773.78]  Four point whatever gigahertz turbo for like.
[1775.06 --> 1775.98]  I don't know.
[1776.28 --> 1776.98]  Three seconds.
[1776.98 --> 1778.92]  And then it would drop to like 3.2.
[1779.32 --> 1779.80]  Whoa.
[1779.96 --> 1781.00]  So we got a new BIOS.
[1781.50 --> 1781.98]  Fixed.
[1782.80 --> 1786.58]  So it looks like this launch might have been a little rushed.
[1786.74 --> 1786.98]  Now.
[1787.54 --> 1790.80]  Unfortunately we weren't able to comment on that in our coffee lake review.
[1790.80 --> 1793.50]  Because as a general rule.
[1793.70 --> 1795.02]  We have made a habit.
[1795.70 --> 1798.56]  Of using only one particular brand of motherboard.
[1798.88 --> 1799.98]  For our launch reviews.
[1800.82 --> 1802.36]  Because we have found.
[1802.52 --> 1806.94]  That it means we're less likely to end up with a 1200 point Cinebench score.
[1807.06 --> 1808.98]  When we were supposed to have 1550.
[1809.18 --> 1809.42]  Wow.
[1809.50 --> 1809.86]  Interesting.
[1810.00 --> 1811.68]  It's like that's paid off for us so far.
[1811.68 --> 1814.88]  But anyway.
[1815.72 --> 1819.38]  Anthony also said that one of his hunches is VRM throttling.
[1819.48 --> 1821.08]  Thanks to the lower specified voltages.
[1823.78 --> 1826.20]  And that could be affecting their CPU scores.
[1826.68 --> 1828.94]  And it seems like that would make perfect sense.
[1829.04 --> 1830.80]  For something like what happened with that.
[1831.20 --> 1832.78]  With that prebuilt machine.
[1832.96 --> 1833.08]  Yep.
[1834.08 --> 1835.10]  Anyway to be clear.
[1835.22 --> 1839.96]  It's not like I'm crapping on MSI or Gigabyte or ASRock or ASUS even.
[1840.08 --> 1841.48]  It's not like they don't make mistakes.
[1841.48 --> 1842.06]  They do.
[1842.74 --> 1843.90]  They all do.
[1844.74 --> 1846.94]  But what it looks like might have happened with this launch.
[1847.04 --> 1847.74]  Is that it got.
[1848.12 --> 1849.54]  It might have been kind of rushed.
[1849.72 --> 1850.64]  If you're not making mistakes.
[1850.76 --> 1851.80]  You're not trying hard enough.
[1851.84 --> 1852.04]  Yeah.
[1852.12 --> 1854.48]  You're not going fast and frantically enough.
[1854.52 --> 1854.76]  Yeah.
[1854.96 --> 1855.74]  Type faster.
[1855.90 --> 1856.12]  Yeah.
[1858.62 --> 1859.30]  So anyway.
[1859.40 --> 1862.00]  It looks like that has a fair bit to do with.
[1862.38 --> 1865.24]  With people's coffee lake results being kind of all over the place.
[1866.14 --> 1867.94]  Like even some of ours were.
[1868.04 --> 1869.28]  Like we have some gaming results.
[1869.28 --> 1872.08]  Where coffee lake in spite of its faster clock speed.
[1872.28 --> 1873.88]  And nearly identical architecture.
[1874.28 --> 1874.98]  And more cash.
[1875.14 --> 1877.70]  Is getting beat by the 7700k in gaming.
[1878.04 --> 1879.64]  And people are like this is impossible.
[1879.76 --> 1880.82]  These numbers are fake news.
[1881.14 --> 1881.50]  It's like.
[1881.74 --> 1881.96]  Okay.
[1881.96 --> 1882.46]  First of all.
[1882.52 --> 1885.06]  You guys can't even decide what agenda I'm fighting for.
[1885.36 --> 1887.00]  Because if I was on Intel's side.
[1887.72 --> 1892.10]  I sure as heck wouldn't be talking about how the new chip doesn't perform as well as the old one.
[1892.12 --> 1893.14]  You're fast and loose.
[1893.30 --> 1895.26]  Just whoever can hand over the check fast enough.
[1895.30 --> 1895.46]  Like.
[1895.66 --> 1896.32]  Boom boom boom.
[1896.44 --> 1897.42]  From minute to minute.
[1897.48 --> 1897.70]  Yeah.
[1897.82 --> 1897.96]  Yeah.
[1897.96 --> 1898.60]  You know.
[1899.60 --> 1900.32]  It's Friday.
[1900.46 --> 1901.66]  When the mail delivery arrives.
[1901.66 --> 1901.96]  I need new check.
[1902.10 --> 1902.64]  I could be.
[1902.72 --> 1904.66]  I could be changing sides like that.
[1904.86 --> 1907.14]  If your CPU box doesn't have a few hundreds in it.
[1907.20 --> 1908.14]  You ain't getting a good review.
[1908.22 --> 1908.64]  That's right.
[1908.82 --> 1909.30]  Figure it out.
[1910.68 --> 1911.94]  Actually please don't do that.
[1912.02 --> 1912.34]  So anyway.
[1912.48 --> 1913.26]  It looks like.
[1913.26 --> 1914.06]  It looks like.
[1914.06 --> 1917.52]  That could be to do with something like a Windows scheduling issue.
[1917.96 --> 1921.98]  Which was one of the things that affected Ryzen 7 performance back when it launched.
[1922.40 --> 1922.72]  I mean.
[1924.14 --> 1925.78]  Am I saying that it's for sure that?
[1926.12 --> 1926.38]  No.
[1926.90 --> 1927.36]  But.
[1927.62 --> 1929.94]  12 threads is more to handle than 8.
[1930.10 --> 1932.38]  And we already know from the past.
[1932.72 --> 1936.28]  That hyper threading can affect gaming performance negatively.
[1937.16 --> 1937.58]  So.
[1937.90 --> 1939.66]  That might be one of the reasons that.
[1939.96 --> 1941.36]  And we didn't get an 8600K.
[1941.44 --> 1943.02]  I almost want to do a separate review of it.
[1943.36 --> 1947.84]  Because they are kneecapping the i5.
[1948.20 --> 1949.74]  Like more every generation.
[1950.06 --> 1950.16]  Yeah.
[1950.16 --> 1954.60]  The 8600K is a significantly slower chip unless you overclock.
[1954.72 --> 1956.74]  It used to be what everyone purchased.
[1957.12 --> 1957.34]  Yeah.
[1957.80 --> 1960.20]  And Intel has gradually tried to.
[1960.74 --> 1961.84]  Move people to i7.
[1961.98 --> 1963.90]  They've tried to brand the i7 better.
[1964.26 --> 1966.60]  And apparently that's not enough.
[1966.86 --> 1967.74]  So they are.
[1967.92 --> 1970.06]  Well I bet you that's part of the existence of i9.
[1970.62 --> 1973.50]  It's trying to be like i7 isn't the most expensive one.
[1974.52 --> 1975.52]  That's an interesting thought.
[1975.58 --> 1976.46]  I never thought about it that way.
[1976.46 --> 1976.68]  Well.
[1976.96 --> 1978.62]  Actually I had never thought about this before either.
[1978.62 --> 1979.58]  But when you go to the store.
[1979.72 --> 1980.86]  The shampoo bottle example.
[1981.78 --> 1982.48]  You know the like.
[1982.58 --> 1983.68]  This is the way too expensive one.
[1983.76 --> 1984.68]  This is the way too cheap one.
[1984.70 --> 1986.74]  I'm going to buy the one in the middle.
[1986.92 --> 1988.20]  Or if you take four of them.
[1988.26 --> 1989.48]  I'm going to buy the third one.
[1990.52 --> 1992.62]  Because it's like more value than really expensive one.
[1992.68 --> 1994.16]  But I'm still getting a nice premium thing.
[1994.16 --> 1998.60]  Maybe that's some of the thought process there.
[2000.44 --> 2001.16]  All right.
[2001.34 --> 2002.14]  So oh you know what.
[2002.14 --> 2005.00]  By the way people in the chat still doing the yes and no meme.
[2005.14 --> 2005.88]  That's impressive.
[2006.14 --> 2007.02]  I know we haven't even done it.
[2007.02 --> 2007.72]  We should do a shirt.
[2008.22 --> 2009.62]  Yeah but now it's going to be too late.
[2009.70 --> 2009.88]  I know.
[2009.88 --> 2011.86]  Because it'll be like a month or two until we have the shirt.
[2011.86 --> 2012.88]  It's our own dead meme.
[2013.20 --> 2013.44]  Yeah.
[2013.64 --> 2016.10]  I said we should do a shirt like the day that thing started.
[2016.20 --> 2016.96]  Dead memes yes.
[2017.08 --> 2017.86]  And then we didn't.
[2018.90 --> 2020.72]  Speaking of dead memes.
[2021.64 --> 2023.06]  That's not really a dead meme.
[2023.70 --> 2024.26]  FreshBooks.
[2024.86 --> 2025.12]  Yeah.
[2025.86 --> 2032.68]  FreshBooks is the super simple to use invoicing tool that helps you if you're a small business owner or a freelancer.
[2032.90 --> 2035.54]  It helps you track your time with the timesheet function.

[2037.06 --> 2038.74]  And keep track of who owes you what.
[2039.22 --> 2043.00]  It also has a feature that tells you when your client looks at your invoice for the first time.
[2043.38 --> 2046.94]  What's really cool is FreshBooks has all the functionality of the desktop version.
[2046.96 --> 2050.32]  built into their mobile version.
[2050.60 --> 2050.96]  Very cool.
[2050.96 --> 2053.18]  So you can take FreshBooks with you wherever you go.
[2053.94 --> 2055.34]  Their support is amazing.
[2055.52 --> 2057.60]  If you have questions you can reach out to their staff.
[2057.76 --> 2061.20]  You call them and you will actually just speak to a real human immediately.
[2061.98 --> 2062.22]  Just like.
[2062.42 --> 2063.84]  No escalations even.
[2064.14 --> 2064.26]  Yeah.
[2064.38 --> 2065.74]  That's the only person you need.
[2065.86 --> 2066.08]  Yep.

[2075.94 --> 2077.94]  or doing small time computer repair.
[2078.58 --> 2079.18]  Or you know.
[2079.30 --> 2079.56]  You know.
[2079.66 --> 2080.68]  Console restoration.
[2080.84 --> 2081.78]  Whatever it is that you do.
[2081.86 --> 2083.00]  That you make a few bucks at.
[2083.08 --> 2085.26]  FreshBooks can help you spend more time doing it.
[2085.42 --> 2088.92]  And less time fussing about with complicated accounting software.
[2089.64 --> 2092.32]  Speaking of not fussing around with complicated software.
[2092.48 --> 2094.54]  Squarespace makes it super simple.
[2094.54 --> 2097.92]  To make a gorgeous website that works great on any device.
[2098.30 --> 2099.38]  And I mean.
[2099.70 --> 2102.76]  I'm sure their legal would never let me actually make a claim like this.
[2102.76 --> 2103.96]  But they have nothing to do with it.
[2104.02 --> 2104.92]  Like never goes down.
[2105.58 --> 2106.82]  Like our Squarespace site.
[2107.06 --> 2108.14]  Never goes down.
[2108.40 --> 2108.52]  Yeah.
[2108.64 --> 2111.04]  And I'm sure it's possible for a Squarespace site to go down.
[2111.10 --> 2111.38]  It is.
[2111.38 --> 2112.06]  Someone's has.
[2112.38 --> 2112.68]  Yep.
[2112.86 --> 2113.94]  Anything can go down.
[2114.32 --> 2114.78]  But.
[2115.44 --> 2116.86]  For all intents and purposes.
[2117.34 --> 2119.84]  Ours has never gone down.
[2120.32 --> 2122.34]  They've also got 24-7 support.
[2122.56 --> 2124.14]  Via live chat and email.
[2124.44 --> 2126.06]  It starts at just 12 bucks a month.
[2126.24 --> 2128.92]  And all their site templates feature responsive design.
[2129.02 --> 2130.44]  So they'll look great on any design.
[2130.64 --> 2131.28]  Which is huge.
[2131.44 --> 2132.04]  Any design.
[2132.18 --> 2132.66]  Any device.
[2132.70 --> 2133.10]  Device.
[2134.16 --> 2135.52]  They've got tons of great features.
[2135.62 --> 2136.28]  Like cover pages.
[2136.48 --> 2137.30]  Their logo designer.
[2137.80 --> 2140.34]  And the ability to publish content in Apple News format.
[2140.34 --> 2142.72]  And you can start a trial with no credit card required.
[2142.86 --> 2144.98]  Over at squarespace.com slash when.
[2145.18 --> 2146.30]  Then when you sign up.
[2146.68 --> 2147.68]  Then use offer code when.
[2147.68 --> 2150.18]  Then you can get 10% off your first purchase.
[2150.30 --> 2151.14]  Someone said it's down now.
[2151.36 --> 2151.82]  It's not.
[2153.02 --> 2154.10]  It's definitely still up.
[2155.64 --> 2156.68]  Do I have to prove it live?
[2157.36 --> 2158.38]  Do I have to do this?
[2158.64 --> 2159.40]  Do I have to do this?
[2159.92 --> 2160.48]  You can.
[2161.44 --> 2161.88]  Hold on.
[2162.42 --> 2162.60]  Wait.
[2162.64 --> 2162.82]  What?
[2163.06 --> 2163.98]  What did I just click on?
[2164.88 --> 2165.12]  What?
[2166.02 --> 2166.40]  What the?
[2166.86 --> 2167.12]  Oh.
[2167.32 --> 2168.36]  I'll fix that later.
[2169.32 --> 2169.58]  Boop.
[2172.16 --> 2173.32]  It's definitely up.
[2174.66 --> 2175.28]  All right.
[2175.28 --> 2176.52]  Linus Media Group.com.
[2176.52 --> 2178.94]  We haven't updated this in so long.
[2179.10 --> 2179.92]  It's so old.
[2180.44 --> 2181.18]  Our team.
[2181.32 --> 2182.48]  Let's see who's even on here.
[2184.54 --> 2184.98]  Linus.
[2185.96 --> 2186.44]  Luke.
[2186.64 --> 2186.78]  Yeah.
[2186.82 --> 2187.44]  We've got to get you.
[2187.48 --> 2188.52]  Got to get you removed.
[2188.80 --> 2189.18]  Wow.
[2191.48 --> 2191.96]  Hey.
[2192.08 --> 2192.98]  I don't make the rules.
[2193.52 --> 2194.06]  I don't make the rules.
[2194.20 --> 2194.30]  Man.
[2194.34 --> 2195.30]  That's going to be really weird.
[2197.26 --> 2197.58]  Tyler.
[2197.58 --> 2197.94]  Tyler.
[2198.20 --> 2198.66]  Max.
[2198.94 --> 2199.38]  Anthony.
[2199.80 --> 2200.12]  Alex.
[2200.24 --> 2200.68]  James.
[2200.68 --> 2202.92]  Ivan's not on here.
[2206.06 --> 2207.28]  Is Jake on here even?
[2208.16 --> 2208.44]  Oh yeah.
[2208.48 --> 2208.98]  Jake's on here.
[2209.04 --> 2209.58]  Jake's on here.
[2212.24 --> 2214.18]  I'm sure there's someone else we're missing actually.
[2214.22 --> 2215.56]  Jake's like sort of an old member now.
[2215.68 --> 2216.34]  I know.
[2216.44 --> 2216.80]  Right?
[2218.02 --> 2219.30]  He was before Pella.
[2219.66 --> 2219.98]  Yeah.
[2221.02 --> 2223.42]  He once rode from Victoria to San Francisco.
[2223.88 --> 2225.88]  I didn't even know that.
[2225.88 --> 2226.06]  Hello?
[2226.20 --> 2226.40]  Hello.
[2226.66 --> 2226.82]  Yeah.
[2226.90 --> 2227.14]  Yeah.
[2227.78 --> 2228.76]  Like dude.
[2228.94 --> 2232.86]  I also didn't know he had never used a Windows computer before he started working here.
[2233.08 --> 2236.18]  I wish he wasn't physically broken because I'd like to go swimming with him.
[2236.94 --> 2237.86]  Holy crap.
[2237.98 --> 2239.44]  But he's physically broken right now.
[2239.64 --> 2239.98]  Oh.
[2240.32 --> 2240.88]  He'll fix it.
[2240.90 --> 2241.78]  How's he broken right now?
[2241.78 --> 2244.14]  Just like shoulder and knee issues and stuff.
[2244.14 --> 2244.42]  Oh bummer.
[2244.62 --> 2247.58]  Probably from doing stuff like biking from Victoria to San Francisco.
[2247.70 --> 2247.86]  Right.
[2248.32 --> 2248.54]  Yeah.
[2248.60 --> 2248.82]  Okay.
[2249.48 --> 2251.30]  In like a really short period of time.
[2251.30 --> 2254.80]  I don't remember what it is but like he got there really fast and then went back.
[2257.46 --> 2259.30]  Like it's actually kind of amazing.
[2259.76 --> 2260.52]  Dude's super cool.
[2260.68 --> 2261.08]  All right.
[2261.18 --> 2265.92]  So Synergy allows you to solve the problem of having two keyboards and two mice.
[2266.24 --> 2267.94]  It allows you to solve lots of problems even.
[2267.94 --> 2276.86]  Like being able to throw your laptop on your desk and being able to just like use your desktop peripherals and like do stuff on your laptop.
[2277.02 --> 2278.12]  Just bam like that.
[2278.12 --> 2281.84]  I had a setup for a while where I was using my laptop a lot more than I am now.
[2282.00 --> 2282.14]  Yeah.
[2282.20 --> 2286.30]  And I got an arm that was actually just a monitor arm and then you get a plate on it.
[2286.36 --> 2287.20]  That's a laptop plate.
[2287.20 --> 2287.22]  Cool.
[2287.34 --> 2287.50]  Yeah.
[2287.62 --> 2289.88]  And then you over torque the tension and all that kind of stuff.
[2289.94 --> 2290.10]  Whatever.
[2290.18 --> 2290.42]  It's fine.
[2290.66 --> 2291.94]  And then you put the laptop on there.
[2292.02 --> 2293.70]  So I could go away and use the laptop.
[2294.00 --> 2294.46]  Bring it home.
[2294.60 --> 2295.32]  Put it on the arm.
[2295.32 --> 2302.60]  And then just mouse and keyboard on my whole setup including the laptop which is super nice because you can drag and drop files with it.
[2302.96 --> 2305.60]  You can even move stuff over really easily.
[2305.84 --> 2306.80]  You can set up hot keys.
[2306.80 --> 2309.62]  Hot keys to move your mouse and keyboard over.
[2309.78 --> 2310.50]  It's wonderful.
[2310.50 --> 2312.94]  So it works across platforms.
[2313.14 --> 2319.38]  So it's Linux, Mac and Windows and they offer a basic and pro option with one time payment.
[2319.94 --> 2323.16]  So head over to the link in the video description and or right there.
[2323.60 --> 2325.78]  Seamless.com slash Synergy slash.
[2326.38 --> 2327.82]  That says Linus 31.
[2328.08 --> 2330.54]  But I think the one I'm supposed to give you today is Linus 32.
[2331.30 --> 2333.90]  And save 50% on Synergy today.
[2334.24 --> 2334.72]  It's pretty huge.
[2335.42 --> 2336.58]  It's a big discount.
[2336.58 --> 2340.48]  Someone in here said dual PC streaming works great.
[2340.64 --> 2340.82]  Yeah.
[2340.94 --> 2342.12]  This would be pretty helpful for it.
[2342.20 --> 2342.38]  Yeah.
[2342.46 --> 2343.66]  Actually that's an interesting thought.
[2343.96 --> 2344.10]  Yeah.
[2344.88 --> 2345.24]  Yeah.
[2345.30 --> 2346.30]  That's a good idea.
[2346.42 --> 2351.14]  One of the examples I always use is what was it?
[2354.74 --> 2355.14]  Right.
[2355.22 --> 2355.68]  Like coders.
[2356.28 --> 2356.52]  Yeah.
[2356.60 --> 2360.52]  Where you have like a development machine and then you also have like a gaming box next to it or whatever else.
[2360.64 --> 2360.76]  Yeah.
[2361.62 --> 2362.38]  All right.
[2362.64 --> 2364.30]  We've got some more topics for you guys now.
[2364.30 --> 2366.24]  So Logitech was upset.
[2366.58 --> 2370.40]  That I called their keycap markings stickers.
[2371.36 --> 2372.76]  In the what was it?
[2372.80 --> 2373.22]  The G.
[2373.70 --> 2374.32]  Hold on.
[2375.06 --> 2375.60]  G whatever.
[2375.82 --> 2377.94]  I can't keep track of Logitech's naming scheme.
[2378.04 --> 2379.84]  It was their wireless mechanical keyboard though.
[2380.60 --> 2383.00]  G6 something.
[2384.02 --> 2385.04]  I think it was G6 something.
[2385.22 --> 2386.94]  I don't like their naming schemes.
[2387.96 --> 2389.44]  Logitech G613.
[2389.44 --> 2391.32]  Okay.
[2392.32 --> 2394.36]  I can't tell from that what it is.
[2394.36 --> 2395.22]  G612 is a mouse.
[2395.56 --> 2395.84]  Yeah.
[2396.06 --> 2396.58]  I can't.
[2397.12 --> 2397.42]  Yeah.
[2397.60 --> 2398.32]  I don't like it.
[2399.06 --> 2400.52]  So I don't know.
[2401.58 --> 2402.54]  I don't know what to say.
[2402.78 --> 2403.16]  I like.
[2403.26 --> 2405.72]  I know it's not as cool because G for gaming whatever.
[2405.72 --> 2406.12]  Yeah.
[2406.12 --> 2408.68]  But I would like it if it was like H headphones.
[2409.02 --> 2409.28]  M.
[2409.54 --> 2409.88]  Mouse.
[2410.38 --> 2410.58]  K.
[2410.82 --> 2411.14]  Keyboard.
[2411.56 --> 2411.78]  Right.
[2411.88 --> 2412.98]  So basically Corsair.
[2413.68 --> 2414.14]  I guess.
[2414.90 --> 2416.14]  So maybe that's why they can't do it.
[2417.06 --> 2417.24]  Wait.
[2417.32 --> 2419.42]  Does Corsair even still do that?
[2419.48 --> 2419.64]  Yeah.
[2419.64 --> 2421.74]  Like this is an M65 or whatever.
[2421.84 --> 2421.92]  Yeah.
[2422.00 --> 2422.08]  Yeah.
[2422.08 --> 2422.42]  I think so.
[2422.42 --> 2422.96]  That's not new though is it?
[2423.02 --> 2425.52]  And they have like their HS which is headset.
[2426.34 --> 2427.82]  Like HS100s if you go back.
[2428.10 --> 2429.48]  Corsair started moving away from it though.
[2429.54 --> 2431.34]  They've gone with like Void Pro.
[2432.06 --> 2432.26]  Yeah.
[2432.44 --> 2433.40]  Like what the heck is that?
[2433.48 --> 2434.12]  I know what it is.
[2434.20 --> 2434.80]  I know what it is.
[2434.94 --> 2438.10]  But like if I was a consumer who wasn't super into this stuff.
[2438.22 --> 2438.74]  What is it?
[2439.04 --> 2439.44]  Anyway.
[2439.66 --> 2440.50]  So they were upset.
[2440.80 --> 2442.64]  And I told them I would address it on the when show.
[2442.90 --> 2444.00]  Because we called them stickers.
[2444.94 --> 2445.88]  And this.
[2446.10 --> 2446.32]  Okay.
[2446.32 --> 2451.42]  So the keycaps are textured ABS plastic that are printed and treated with a UV coating.
[2451.58 --> 2452.72]  This is a standard process.
[2452.92 --> 2454.02]  They are not stickers.
[2455.38 --> 2460.92]  What we were complaining about was that dual shot would be better.
[2461.30 --> 2463.22]  Because it's a lot more durable.
[2463.74 --> 2464.88]  And quite frankly.
[2467.00 --> 2469.20]  It can be UV coated all you want.
[2469.98 --> 2473.40]  And it can be treated and whatever.
[2473.40 --> 2474.44]  UV coating helps.
[2474.86 --> 2475.84]  It is still a sticker.
[2476.32 --> 2479.66]  It's a good sticker.
[2482.68 --> 2483.10]  But.
[2483.42 --> 2484.58]  It is a thing.
[2485.06 --> 2486.48]  That is stuck.
[2486.98 --> 2487.72]  On top.
[2487.78 --> 2488.18]  Okay.
[2488.44 --> 2488.64]  Yeah.
[2488.74 --> 2489.34]  Of a keycap.
[2489.34 --> 2491.36]  Because I was going to be like it's not a sticker though.
[2491.38 --> 2492.18]  It's not a sticker.
[2492.34 --> 2492.58]  So.
[2492.78 --> 2494.06]  What I want to say is look.
[2494.12 --> 2494.52]  I'm sorry.
[2494.64 --> 2496.20]  It was unfair to call it a sticker.
[2496.48 --> 2497.24]  It's not a sticker.
[2497.46 --> 2497.64]  No.
[2498.64 --> 2499.80]  But it isn't dual shot.
[2499.80 --> 2501.26]  And as far as I'm concerned.
[2501.26 --> 2505.12]  A $150 keyboard has dual shot keycaps.
[2505.26 --> 2507.42]  So the wording was a little over inflammatory.
[2507.42 --> 2508.88]  But the point stays the same.
[2509.12 --> 2509.38]  Yes.
[2509.76 --> 2510.02]  Yeah.
[2510.02 --> 2513.78]  And their defense is that if your name is Logitech.
[2513.84 --> 2516.80]  You make a lot of different keyboards for the entire world in many different layouts.
[2517.44 --> 2517.68]  Nice.
[2517.68 --> 2525.18]  And dual shot keycaps might not be feasible across you know some of these more niche layouts and or regions.
[2525.44 --> 2530.02]  And you'll generate complaints if some of them are dual shot and some of them are not.
[2530.66 --> 2531.36]  Totally get it.
[2532.00 --> 2532.66]  Still don't care.
[2533.30 --> 2537.06]  A $150 keyboard should have dual shot keycaps.
[2538.62 --> 2538.98]  Period.
[2538.98 --> 2540.04]  And that like that sucks.
[2540.16 --> 2542.62]  And that's a really annoying manufacturing thing and all that kind of stuff.
[2542.66 --> 2543.18]  And I hear that.
[2543.26 --> 2547.38]  But I would rather spend my $150 on a keyboard where I'm getting dual shot keycaps.
[2547.40 --> 2548.90]  It's $150 US dollars.
[2549.14 --> 2550.02]  That's a lot of money.
[2550.02 --> 2551.40]  So it's like a $200 Canadian dollar keyboard.
[2551.50 --> 2552.58]  That's a really expensive keyboard.
[2552.60 --> 2553.72]  And it's wireless or whatever.
[2553.80 --> 2554.56]  And that's great.
[2555.16 --> 2555.34]  But.
[2555.52 --> 2556.36]  I actually don't care.
[2556.54 --> 2556.94]  It's a keyboard.
[2556.94 --> 2560.10]  I would be pretty not stoked about.
[2560.18 --> 2561.32]  Do you care about wireless keyboards?
[2563.34 --> 2566.62]  I like RGB backlighting on my keyboards.
[2567.08 --> 2567.62]  Believe it or not.
[2567.84 --> 2569.02]  So no then.
[2569.32 --> 2569.80]  So no.
[2569.82 --> 2570.52]  Because battery life.
[2570.52 --> 2570.82]  For now.
[2570.98 --> 2571.14]  Yeah.
[2571.22 --> 2571.42]  Yeah.
[2572.02 --> 2572.24]  Yeah.
[2573.26 --> 2577.78]  Apparently if they had made it RGB backlit the battery life would be like a day.
[2578.14 --> 2580.44]  Instead of six months or whatever.
[2580.72 --> 2580.84]  Yeah.
[2581.58 --> 2582.58]  I'm not surprised.
[2582.58 --> 2587.48]  See I'm like I just having less cables on your desk is nice.
[2587.66 --> 2590.36]  But one of the easiest things to cable manage on your desk is your keyboard.
[2590.96 --> 2591.20]  Yeah.
[2591.42 --> 2593.00]  Especially in terms of permanent cable.
[2593.10 --> 2594.06]  Yes and no actually.
[2594.34 --> 2596.24]  Because it goes right into your monitor stand.
[2596.42 --> 2597.92]  So a lot of time you have to like cross.
[2598.04 --> 2599.30]  Actually I'm going to disagree with you there.
[2599.62 --> 2602.02]  I think the keyboard is one of the harder things to cable manage.
[2602.02 --> 2603.68]  Some monitor stands have cable management slots.
[2603.80 --> 2604.54]  Some of them do.
[2604.58 --> 2604.84]  Not all.
[2604.92 --> 2605.80]  Very few do.
[2605.82 --> 2606.10]  That's true.
[2606.38 --> 2606.80]  Yes.
[2606.80 --> 2612.14]  Like monitor makers have got to be some of the most oblivious out there when it comes
[2612.14 --> 2615.10]  to like building functionality into their product.
[2615.44 --> 2615.64]  Yeah.
[2615.84 --> 2616.24]  So.
[2616.56 --> 2616.72]  Yeah.
[2617.30 --> 2620.36]  But like I guess for my desk it's pretty easy.
[2620.50 --> 2621.76]  Because I have my mixer right there.
[2621.88 --> 2624.98]  So I just pinch those cable runs in between the mixer and the monitor stand.
[2625.20 --> 2626.54]  And they all just hold themselves naturally.
[2626.54 --> 2626.82]  That makes sense.
[2627.08 --> 2628.38]  But like a lot of monitors too.
[2628.38 --> 2628.84]  Not everyone will have that.
[2628.90 --> 2631.12]  Have like you know legs that come out like this right.
[2631.32 --> 2631.82]  That can be annoying.
[2631.82 --> 2633.32]  You have to like go around it.
[2633.32 --> 2637.96]  The ones I'm thinking of their feet are up and they taper down like this.
[2638.14 --> 2639.82]  You can put the cable right in there.
[2639.92 --> 2640.12]  Okay.
[2640.30 --> 2640.66]  All right.
[2640.90 --> 2641.50]  So that works.
[2641.92 --> 2642.34]  There's there.
[2642.50 --> 2644.42]  It's it's not that difficult to manage.
[2645.28 --> 2649.66]  And I would rather like I understand that the battery life is going to be huge.
[2649.80 --> 2652.86]  I would rather just never worry about it personally.
[2653.70 --> 2655.84]  So Doc Swag posted on the forum.
[2655.84 --> 2659.52]  The Pixel 2 and the Pixel 2 XL.
[2660.54 --> 2663.00]  And this is a great little spec sheet.
[2663.00 --> 2663.30]  Wow.
[2663.76 --> 2664.34]  Fantastic.
[2665.86 --> 2668.54]  So basically better camera than before.
[2668.70 --> 2668.78]  Yep.
[2669.50 --> 2671.80]  Spec wise it's a modern phone.
[2672.12 --> 2672.36]  Yep.
[2672.46 --> 2674.60]  So it's exactly what you would expect pretty much.
[2674.70 --> 2675.32]  4 gigs RAM.
[2675.44 --> 2677.16]  64 slash 128 gig.
[2678.80 --> 2679.32]  Storage.
[2679.62 --> 2682.40]  It's got pretty much the same battery life as the previous pics.
[2682.54 --> 2685.68]  Or pretty much the same battery capacity as the previous pixels give or take.
[2687.34 --> 2688.00]  DCIP3 screens.
[2688.96 --> 2689.52]  That's pretty cool.
[2689.52 --> 2693.98]  Same resolutions as before except the XL.
[2694.22 --> 2696.22]  It has a different aspect ratio.
[2698.22 --> 2699.18]  Still AMOLED.
[2699.38 --> 2700.04]  Same RAM.
[2700.40 --> 2700.70]  Okay.
[2701.20 --> 2701.94]  No headphone jack.
[2702.00 --> 2702.92]  Is this a deal killer for you?
[2704.38 --> 2705.02]  No.
[2705.72 --> 2706.26]  Really?
[2706.26 --> 2708.88]  I don't listen to...
[2708.88 --> 2709.68]  How interesting.
[2710.76 --> 2711.54]  Music on my...
[2711.54 --> 2713.36]  Like it's not a positive.
[2713.96 --> 2714.96]  I disagree with it.
[2715.06 --> 2715.80]  I don't like it.
[2716.06 --> 2717.62]  It wouldn't deal kill the phone for me.
[2718.90 --> 2719.92]  If that makes sense.
[2720.14 --> 2720.48]  Okay.
[2720.48 --> 2724.42]  I don't listen to music on my headphones for my phone that often.
[2724.76 --> 2725.02]  Okay.
[2727.44 --> 2728.92]  Because I know you're a Pixel fan.
[2729.26 --> 2729.46]  Yeah.
[2729.58 --> 2730.88]  And it's water resistant now.
[2731.00 --> 2732.10]  Which I know was one of the big things for you.
[2732.10 --> 2732.90]  That's a huge deal.
[2733.08 --> 2733.42]  I'm missing.
[2733.56 --> 2734.50]  I'm wondering about this.
[2734.64 --> 2735.72]  I'm hoping they fixed this.
[2736.00 --> 2736.72]  It's cloth.
[2737.30 --> 2740.22]  Oh, the earpiece grill?
[2740.22 --> 2746.24]  The earpiece grill on the Pixel and Pixel XL, not the Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2, is cloth.
[2746.56 --> 2747.96]  And people go in there and try to clean it.
[2748.06 --> 2751.18]  And mine's like not looking that great.
[2751.28 --> 2756.60]  Because it like absorbs gunk over the year-ish that I've used it.
[2756.72 --> 2757.82]  And you can't clean it.
[2757.82 --> 2760.14]  Because if you try to scrape it, you'll rip the cloth.
[2760.82 --> 2762.26]  And there's pictures of people that have done it.
[2762.30 --> 2763.34]  It's so stupid.
[2763.58 --> 2768.42]  There's a lot of like really weird, stupid things that were overlooked that will hopefully have been fixed.
[2768.52 --> 2769.58]  One of them is water resistance.
[2769.58 --> 2770.78]  You've checked out the colors.
[2771.18 --> 2771.28]  Yeah.
[2771.28 --> 2773.06]  Do you like kind of blue, just black, or clearly white?
[2773.32 --> 2774.62]  The names are weird.
[2775.80 --> 2776.84]  I don't know.
[2777.02 --> 2778.70]  I kind of like the panda look.
[2779.28 --> 2779.52]  Yeah?
[2779.64 --> 2779.84]  Okay.
[2779.92 --> 2780.66]  I think it looks all right.
[2780.88 --> 2787.30]  I think out of all of the phones, the Pixels are kind of boring.
[2788.42 --> 2789.42]  If that makes sense.
[2789.66 --> 2791.16]  Like they're not sleek and sexy.
[2791.84 --> 2793.36]  They called the design iconic.
[2793.54 --> 2794.18]  Would you agree with that?
[2794.20 --> 2794.44]  No.
[2794.98 --> 2795.26]  Oh.
[2795.88 --> 2797.04]  Well, that's not very nice.
[2797.06 --> 2798.74]  I don't think it's a bad thing necessarily.
[2798.74 --> 2801.68]  I just think it doesn't stand out.
[2802.02 --> 2803.20]  It's not iconic.
[2803.44 --> 2805.54]  It's the like opposite of iconic.
[2806.98 --> 2808.40]  And there's glass on the back.
[2808.62 --> 2810.76]  So everyone's probably just going to want to skin it anyways.
[2811.68 --> 2813.02]  So I don't know.
[2813.90 --> 2814.72]  You know, it's funny.
[2814.84 --> 2820.64]  A lot of people, a lot of people in the Twitch chat, not upset about no three and a half mil jack.
[2821.48 --> 2821.88]  Okay.
[2822.10 --> 2824.16]  My thing is, they have all the adapters.
[2825.06 --> 2828.48]  The main times that I use headphones on my phone is when I'm traveling.
[2829.16 --> 2836.54]  And it's usually my active noise cancelling headphones that have a carrying case that have their cable in the carrying case.
[2836.58 --> 2836.74]  Sure.
[2836.84 --> 2838.06]  That I can just have the adapter in.
[2838.16 --> 2838.34]  Yep.
[2838.34 --> 2843.00]  Like it's, I use headphones with my phone so little that it's not a big deal.
[2843.08 --> 2843.16]  Okay.
[2843.20 --> 2846.44]  All the people who are upset are flipping the math out right now.
[2846.54 --> 2846.88]  Oh, yeah.
[2847.00 --> 2847.92]  Because they are upset.
[2848.06 --> 2848.20]  Okay.
[2848.30 --> 2848.54]  Okay.
[2848.68 --> 2848.98]  Okay.
[2849.12 --> 2849.52]  I got it.
[2849.56 --> 2849.82]  I got it.
[2849.82 --> 2851.38]  And like in my car, I use Bluetooth.
[2851.38 --> 2857.28]  You can buy Bluetooth dongles where you plug your like headphones or whatever into it.
[2857.54 --> 2859.16]  And then it interfaces with your phone.
[2859.28 --> 2862.22]  So you can turn your wired headphones into Bluetooth headphones.
[2862.24 --> 2862.26]  Yeah.
[2862.26 --> 2862.92]  They're super cheap.
[2863.00 --> 2864.14]  They're ridiculously cheap.
[2864.20 --> 2865.42]  They're like $5 on Amazon or whatever.
[2865.42 --> 2865.90]  They work really well.
[2865.92 --> 2867.92]  They hold charge for a really long time.
[2868.90 --> 2870.60]  It's, it's not that bad.
[2870.92 --> 2871.94]  I don't like it.
[2872.02 --> 2872.90]  I don't think it's worth it.
[2872.94 --> 2874.18]  I think it's a bad design move.
[2874.28 --> 2879.44]  I think it's not worth making the phone thinner at all because the phone doesn't need to be thinner.
[2879.44 --> 2882.06]  I think it's very stupid.
[2882.24 --> 2884.00]  It's not a deal breaker for me personally.
[2884.40 --> 2884.76]  All right.
[2884.80 --> 2885.76]  Let's draw a pull it, baby.
[2886.70 --> 2888.22]  We got people who want a straw pull.
[2888.38 --> 2888.60]  Okay.
[2888.66 --> 2889.50]  Just everybody stop.
[2889.62 --> 2891.68]  Everybody stop talking in the Twitch chat so I can.
[2892.24 --> 2896.06]  And I can totally understand why people would be upset.
[2896.30 --> 2897.86]  Straw pull it, straw pull it, straw pull it.
[2898.30 --> 2899.82]  So I'm like, I'm okay.
[2899.88 --> 2908.86]  I used to carry my headphones loose in my pocket until I lost so many ear tips and broke a fair number of pairs of headphones.
[2908.86 --> 2915.84]  And now I use a carrying case that has a little pocket in it that I keep my stupid lightning adapter in.
[2915.84 --> 2920.24]  Which is the same carrying case I carry for my earbuds.
[2920.54 --> 2923.74]  Now I'll put a, now I'll put a type C adapter in there too, I guess.
[2923.84 --> 2924.08]  Yeah.
[2924.30 --> 2928.60]  Along with an extra ear tip and my non-microphone backup cable.
[2928.60 --> 2938.12]  Like, I'm clearly working around this, but it is a bit of a pain in the butt for me because I'll go and I'll like pull them out and I'll be like, oh right, I'm using that phone.
[2939.82 --> 2941.46]  That's a pretty niche use case.
[2941.68 --> 2942.84]  I know, I know.
[2942.84 --> 2946.12]  And I think you also use headphones with your phone more than most people do.
[2946.38 --> 2947.04]  Every single day.
[2947.18 --> 2947.32]  Yeah.
[2947.48 --> 2950.34]  Every single day, multiple times a day, I use headphones with my phone.
[2950.36 --> 2951.90]  So niche use case on top of niche use case.
[2952.04 --> 2952.50]  Yeah, all right.
[2952.50 --> 2954.42]  And it's still not game breaking for you, right?
[2957.30 --> 2960.32]  I mean, your favorite phone's your iPhone, isn't it?
[2960.68 --> 2961.12]  Yeah.
[2961.40 --> 2963.08]  I like the iPhone 8 best right now.
[2963.26 --> 2965.50]  But, um, like it sucks.
[2965.62 --> 2966.42]  I don't like it.
[2966.54 --> 2968.40]  I would really prefer there was a jack there.
[2968.60 --> 2972.46]  I do not care about the thickness that you lose by losing the jack.
[2972.62 --> 2975.24]  But let's talk about niche people for a minute here.
[2975.24 --> 2988.00]  I also still have an iPhone 6 that I specifically have so I can jack in and like, like, okay,
[2988.12 --> 2990.96]  you know that I listen to shows when I sleep.
[2991.08 --> 2991.26]  Yeah, yeah.
[2991.38 --> 2996.34]  So I specifically still own an iPhone 6 so that I don't have to have an adapter slash I can
[2996.34 --> 2996.84]  charge it.
[2996.98 --> 2999.60]  But didn't you also carry another phone for that earlier?
[3000.14 --> 3001.64]  Or was it an iPod or something?
[3001.96 --> 3003.20]  Yeah, because they're off cycle.
[3003.20 --> 3006.16]  Because this one literally runs all night and the other one runs all day.
[3006.28 --> 3007.50]  So I charge this one in the morning.
[3007.60 --> 3009.00]  So you'd carry an old one anyway.
[3009.22 --> 3011.34]  So I usually would be carrying an old phone anyway.
[3011.52 --> 3012.12]  That's true.
[3012.66 --> 3013.56]  This is true.
[3015.24 --> 3017.08]  Not that it moots your point at all.
[3017.26 --> 3019.32]  I'm just saying you would have the phone anyways.
[3019.58 --> 3019.94]  I would.
[3020.24 --> 3020.62]  I would.
[3023.50 --> 3026.46]  So 66% of people said that they were mad.
[3026.58 --> 3026.78]  Yep.
[3027.96 --> 3028.94]  And that's not surprising.
[3029.32 --> 3032.84]  You know what is surprising, though, is that 34% said they weren't mad.
[3032.84 --> 3033.34]  Weren't mad.
[3033.46 --> 3033.82]  You also didn't.
[3033.82 --> 3035.98]  Which isn't surprising if 66% said they were mad.
[3036.06 --> 3037.56]  You didn't ask if it was a deal breaker.
[3038.38 --> 3039.90]  Because I would have said mad.
[3040.96 --> 3042.02]  But it's not a deal breaker for you.
[3042.02 --> 3043.06]  But it's not a deal breaker.
[3043.52 --> 3047.80]  I would prefer to lose the headphone jack but gain water resistance.
[3048.38 --> 3051.10]  And no longer have a stupid cloth thing there.
[3051.24 --> 3054.02]  And have front facing speakers, which are super cool.
[3054.10 --> 3054.48]  All right.
[3054.48 --> 3055.96]  And the squeeze thing.
[3056.00 --> 3056.54]  I don't really care.
[3056.98 --> 3061.68]  And like a few other things that are nice about the phone that I would trade the headphone jack for.
[3061.84 --> 3062.68]  I think it's stupid.
[3062.84 --> 3067.24]  I would love to have all of those things and a headphone jack because that makes way more freaking sense.
[3067.40 --> 3068.28]  So I am mad.
[3069.24 --> 3071.66]  But it would not deal break the phone for me.
[3071.66 --> 3075.26]  So this is kind of crazy.
[3075.34 --> 3077.94]  The last netlinked.
[3077.94 --> 3078.94]  Dun-dun-dun.
[3078.94 --> 3079.38]  Dun-dun.
[3081.50 --> 3097.96]  So for now, it would appear as though the channel that Luke and I both started our YouTube careers on is in limbo.
[3099.00 --> 3099.80]  In limbo.
[3099.80 --> 3103.68]  That would be the most kind word to probably use for it.
[3103.68 --> 3104.12]  Yeah.
[3105.32 --> 3112.34]  So they haven't uploaded anything since three days ago when a video entitled,
[3112.50 --> 3120.94]  X399 NVMe Raid Support DJI Local Data Mode No More Netlinked For Now went up.
[3122.44 --> 3126.82]  So most of the NCIX Tech Tips team is gone.
[3127.14 --> 3132.52]  So that was me at one point and was Luke at one point and is not those people anymore.
[3132.86 --> 3132.92]  Yeah.
[3132.92 --> 3134.50]  But was also Wheels.
[3135.76 --> 3141.24]  Then Julia, Anthony, Riley, Jack.
[3142.98 --> 3144.72]  Who else am I thinking of here?
[3146.30 --> 3147.26]  Riley, Jack.
[3148.44 --> 3149.64]  Am I missing anyone?
[3150.06 --> 3151.62]  Oh, I mean Barrett.
[3152.28 --> 3153.28]  Riley's brother.
[3153.54 --> 3154.82]  Was Esther part of the team?
[3154.90 --> 3156.36]  Esther was part of the team at some point.
[3156.86 --> 3161.74]  So of all of those people, the people who are gone, all of them.
[3161.74 --> 3166.78]  There you go.
[3166.82 --> 3167.42]  Yeah, that makes sense.
[3167.78 --> 3174.18]  In the last episode, he did say that he's going to be trying to make videos still sometimes.
[3175.38 --> 3180.34]  He was saying hopefully one a week, but was like, do not hold me to that.
[3180.34 --> 3183.16]  So we'll see how that comes out.
[3183.26 --> 3187.40]  So we'll go ahead and like I can maybe address some of the comments here.
[3188.68 --> 3192.36]  You know, rip me if LTT were to ever go under.
[3192.92 --> 3193.52]  Don't worry.
[3193.58 --> 3194.18]  We're not going anywhere.
[3194.34 --> 3194.92]  We're good, man.
[3194.92 --> 3196.54]  Yeah, we're like super awesome and good.
[3196.84 --> 3196.94]  Yeah.
[3198.78 --> 3209.36]  So a lot of people seem to be wondering about how this could happen to a channel with lots of subscribers and actually like okay viewership.
[3209.66 --> 3209.98]  Yeah.
[3209.98 --> 3214.50]  Like you're never going to do well on like mesh Wi-Fi or whatever.
[3214.74 --> 3220.54]  But, you know, the core stuff, Netlink is doing 60, 100,000 views an episode.
[3221.16 --> 3222.24]  That's not bad.
[3223.22 --> 3226.90]  That should be sustainable for a team of a couple people.
[3228.14 --> 3228.86]  Yeah, actually it should.
[3228.86 --> 3230.50]  So people are asking like what happened.
[3230.78 --> 3237.28]  So it seems to have a lot more to do with decision business decisions being made by the parent company.
[3237.54 --> 3240.86]  So I'm not going to comment on sort of.
[3241.94 --> 3245.18]  Oh, so I don't want to comment on anything that I'm being told in confidence.
[3245.32 --> 3246.44]  Like I still know people there.
[3246.54 --> 3249.92]  So I know stuff that that like people don't.
[3249.92 --> 3253.36]  I'll say really vague stuff then because I haven't talked to these people.
[3253.42 --> 3253.66]  Sure.
[3253.76 --> 3257.30]  You can just look at NCX and how they're doing right now.
[3257.30 --> 3259.02]  They're closing stores.
[3259.32 --> 3264.80]  People have been departed from the YouTube channel.
[3265.96 --> 3267.02]  You can see different.
[3267.58 --> 3272.10]  I mean, someone works here now that didn't before that used to work there.
[3273.68 --> 3274.20]  Yeah.
[3274.64 --> 3279.26]  The writing is sort of on the wall and it seems to be going rather quickly.
[3279.86 --> 3281.46]  That's all outside perspective.
[3281.60 --> 3283.86]  Haven't had conversations with anyone in the company stuff.
[3285.18 --> 3286.50]  So there you go.
[3286.50 --> 3287.44]  It's an end of an era.
[3287.58 --> 3295.72]  And I've got to say it's pretty sad for me actually because this was like kind of my baby.
[3296.92 --> 3300.88]  Well, like the store that you worked out of and I used to buy all of my...
[3300.88 --> 3301.22]  Sorry?
[3301.80 --> 3302.00]  Oh.
[3302.26 --> 3302.48]  Yeah.
[3302.48 --> 3303.48]  Yeah.
[3303.48 --> 3303.76]  Yeah.
[3306.32 --> 3306.68]  Yeah.
[3306.76 --> 3307.54]  So it's...
[3307.54 --> 3307.96]  Yeah.
[3308.04 --> 3313.94]  It's kind of tough because this is something that like I started and put my heart and soul
[3313.94 --> 3317.14]  into and became like a part of my personal identity.
[3317.14 --> 3320.72]  Like this was what turned me into a YouTuber.
[3321.04 --> 3321.20]  Yeah.
[3321.20 --> 3330.30]  And to see it kind of go down like this was really frustrating and sad actually.
[3330.42 --> 3330.56]  It's kind of weird.
[3330.56 --> 3334.62]  Because it was weird at first to no longer be a part of that team.
[3334.62 --> 3339.20]  Like the team making the NCIX Tech Tips videos when you and I did it for so long.
[3339.36 --> 3339.56]  Yeah.
[3339.66 --> 3343.60]  And then it's going to be even weirder having that not exist now.
[3345.08 --> 3349.14]  People in Twitch chat are saying that we should buy NCIX.
[3349.14 --> 3349.58]  Yes.
[3350.58 --> 3350.88]  Yes.
[3351.02 --> 3351.78]  That would be...
[3351.78 --> 3352.82]  That would be...
[3352.82 --> 3354.82]  That would be a...
[3354.82 --> 3355.24]  Wow.
[3355.62 --> 3356.22]  How...
[3356.22 --> 3357.64]  How...
[3357.64 --> 3358.52]  How...
[3358.52 --> 3359.12]  How...
[3359.12 --> 3359.82]  How...
[3359.82 --> 3361.32]  How does this idea fail?
[3361.40 --> 3362.34]  Let me count the ways.
[3364.62 --> 3365.84]  Fail so hard.
[3366.86 --> 3367.34]  Buying...
[3367.34 --> 3369.96]  Failing companies is like a sad decision.
[3370.04 --> 3370.30]  Yeah.
[3370.42 --> 3370.58]  Yeah.
[3370.64 --> 3374.94]  Buying companies that are clearly losing money is like good business.
[3374.94 --> 3375.70]  I love so much.
[3375.70 --> 3379.12]  You know, people are asking like, you know, LTE.
[3379.14 --> 3380.36]  LTE's not going anywhere, right?
[3380.84 --> 3383.94]  And it is because we don't make decisions like that.
[3384.54 --> 3387.96]  That Linus Media Group is doing great.
[3389.36 --> 3390.82]  Just great, actually.
[3391.64 --> 3391.92]  Yeah.
[3392.10 --> 3392.48]  Yeah.
[3392.98 --> 3393.94]  I agree with that.
[3394.16 --> 3394.88]  You know what, though?
[3395.42 --> 3396.50]  I would love to buy the channel.
[3396.66 --> 3397.92]  Someone in chat says, hi, Ed.
[3398.26 --> 3398.52]  Oh.
[3399.54 --> 3400.30]  I'd buy it.
[3401.68 --> 3402.12]  Oh.
[3402.40 --> 3403.06]  That would be...
[3403.06 --> 3403.36]  Oh.
[3403.48 --> 3404.20]  That would be weird.
[3405.34 --> 3407.60]  I would buy some of the people that come with it.
[3407.82 --> 3408.82]  I'm not going to name any names,
[3408.82 --> 3410.18]  but I wouldn't buy all of them.
[3410.34 --> 3411.82]  Besides, no people come with it at this point.
[3411.82 --> 3414.58]  Would you rename it and just make it a tech news channel?
[3414.70 --> 3416.60]  I think we could just call it like...
[3416.60 --> 3420.94]  We could just call it like NX Tech Tips or something like that.
[3421.00 --> 3422.38]  We could just like change it a little bit.
[3422.64 --> 3422.88]  Yeah.
[3423.00 --> 3425.96]  Because it would be really weird keeping the NCX Tech Tips.
[3425.96 --> 3427.36]  And we could just make it straight tech news.
[3427.68 --> 3427.88]  Yeah.
[3428.30 --> 3430.52]  Just get rid of every format that wasn't Netlinked.
[3430.78 --> 3430.96]  Yeah.
[3431.14 --> 3431.72]  Because I actually...
[3431.72 --> 3432.78]  I liked the Netlinked format.
[3432.96 --> 3433.42]  I would...
[3433.42 --> 3435.78]  Like, I would see a Netlinked thumbnail.
[3436.00 --> 3436.66]  I'm not surprised you like it.
[3436.66 --> 3437.42]  But it is good.
[3437.48 --> 3438.94]  They changed it a lot from what...
[3438.94 --> 3440.62]  Like, if you look at the early ones, they were trash.
[3441.20 --> 3442.48]  Like, they changed it a lot.
[3442.56 --> 3443.74]  They made it more YouTube-y.
[3443.84 --> 3444.64]  They made it more upbeat.
[3445.04 --> 3446.30]  They made it more fun.
[3447.90 --> 3450.04]  And, you know, I would see a thumbnail and be like,
[3450.06 --> 3451.12]  oh, yeah, what's going on with that?
[3451.14 --> 3452.06]  And I'd click it.
[3452.14 --> 3453.34]  And, like, you know, four minutes would pass.
[3453.36 --> 3454.58]  I'd be like, oh, I just watched the whole video,
[3454.66 --> 3455.92]  which doesn't happen a lot for me.
[3455.94 --> 3457.12]  I don't watch a lot of YouTube videos.
[3457.12 --> 3457.30]  Yeah.
[3457.30 --> 3458.76]  Like, I actually like Netlinked.
[3461.26 --> 3462.52]  So, Sue Ned.
[3464.94 --> 3465.34]  Yeah.
[3465.44 --> 3467.60]  So, I wouldn't mind bringing back Netlinked,
[3467.64 --> 3470.98]  but I'll tell you now that my relationship with NCIX
[3470.98 --> 3475.52]  is not at the best it's been in the last 10 years.
[3476.30 --> 3478.88]  And I don't even think for a fair offer
[3478.88 --> 3480.26]  they'd be interested in selling to me.
[3480.26 --> 3483.52]  So, I could be wrong.
[3483.68 --> 3484.94]  I mean, I could always reach out and be like,
[3485.02 --> 3487.24]  yo, you guys still want that channel?
[3488.00 --> 3491.24]  I mean, with how YouTube treats subscribers
[3491.24 --> 3492.18]  and stuff right now,
[3492.80 --> 3495.42]  it might not be too bad to just start another one.
[3496.16 --> 3498.16]  I think 1.1 mil has a value
[3498.16 --> 3501.24]  because you can build up a big subscriber base
[3501.24 --> 3502.66]  back to, like, getting notifications
[3502.66 --> 3503.82]  faster than you can, like,
[3503.92 --> 3505.38]  build a subscriber base from nothing.
[3506.16 --> 3506.56]  Yeah.
[3506.62 --> 3508.40]  We wouldn't be building a subscriber base from nothing, though.
[3508.40 --> 3509.82]  And I would also just be like,
[3509.88 --> 3512.24]  I would be, like, taking back my baby.
[3512.42 --> 3512.92]  No, I know.
[3513.06 --> 3513.26]  Yeah.
[3513.40 --> 3514.26]  That would be part of it.
[3514.26 --> 3514.44]  I know.
[3514.60 --> 3514.82]  Yeah.
[3514.92 --> 3515.88]  I think that's probably most of it.
[3515.90 --> 3516.66]  That's a big part of it.
[3516.66 --> 3516.90]  Yeah.
[3516.90 --> 3517.38]  Okay.
[3517.74 --> 3518.76]  Why don't we just put it that way?
[3521.48 --> 3523.46]  I completely understand that.
[3523.48 --> 3524.22]  If I had to,
[3524.30 --> 3525.92]  and this I can comment on
[3525.92 --> 3528.34]  because I haven't really talked to anybody about it,
[3528.64 --> 3529.72]  but if I had to guess,
[3530.16 --> 3532.02]  rather than, you know,
[3532.06 --> 3533.70]  do something sensible with it,
[3533.80 --> 3535.08]  they're just going to run it into the ground.
[3536.30 --> 3537.24]  If I had to guess,
[3537.28 --> 3538.58]  I would say they're just going to pull
[3538.58 --> 3540.94]  what Tiger Direct and Newegg did before them.
[3540.94 --> 3546.42]  They're going to have no concept of what made it good.
[3546.58 --> 3546.96]  Oh, my God.
[3546.96 --> 3549.18]  They're going to bring in some random outsiders
[3549.18 --> 3554.16]  to try to make videos.
[3554.38 --> 3557.66]  They're going to have no idea why people watch videos.
[3557.80 --> 3559.42]  They're going to try to just sell stuff,
[3559.42 --> 3562.94]  and it's going to be a complete disaster,
[3563.40 --> 3565.42]  and it's going to just crater.
[3566.68 --> 3567.68]  I'm going to have to, like,
[3567.86 --> 3569.52]  archive some of these old videos.
[3570.00 --> 3570.30]  Yeah.
[3570.56 --> 3571.34]  I get, like, this.
[3571.46 --> 3572.22]  Do you remember doing this?
[3572.46 --> 3574.72]  Oh, the Ultimate Water Cooling Guide Part 3
[3574.72 --> 3576.30]  where we had to, like, build the whole thing,
[3576.38 --> 3577.54]  then tear the whole thing apart,
[3577.66 --> 3578.94]  and then, like, build it again or whatever.
[3579.06 --> 3579.74]  That was awful.
[3580.46 --> 3581.06]  I was like,
[3581.06 --> 3582.50]  was that an all-night shoot?
[3582.80 --> 3584.82]  I think that was, like, two all-night shoots.
[3584.84 --> 3585.50]  I don't remember.
[3585.74 --> 3587.22]  Because there was part one, two, and three.
[3587.38 --> 3588.30]  How many views does it have?
[3588.36 --> 3589.28]  Did it at least get a lot of views?
[3589.32 --> 3590.54]  It did really good for that time.
[3591.46 --> 3592.40]  778,000.
[3592.50 --> 3592.90]  Not bad.
[3593.04 --> 3593.20]  Yeah.
[3593.52 --> 3594.06]  All right.
[3594.62 --> 3597.52]  I think we've got time for maybe one more topic.
[3599.82 --> 3600.18]  Okay.
[3600.22 --> 3601.32]  It's the Intel Show, apparently,
[3601.32 --> 3605.34]  because I'm super, super not stoked on this.
[3605.88 --> 3607.32]  Posted by...
[3607.32 --> 3607.66]  Oh.
[3607.96 --> 3609.32]  Doesn't say who on the forum.
[3611.06 --> 3611.76]  But, like,
[3613.24 --> 3614.20]  WarSTM.
[3614.22 --> 3615.00]  This is just...
[3615.00 --> 3616.94]  Intel will no longer be providing
[3616.94 --> 3618.76]  per-core turbo frequencies,
[3619.68 --> 3623.58]  making motherboard tuning impossible.
[3623.80 --> 3625.10]  So you won't be able to
[3625.10 --> 3627.18]  alter your overclocks per-core.
[3631.54 --> 3633.00]  So, Extreme Tech says,
[3633.08 --> 3635.14]  when we queried Intel as to why
[3635.14 --> 3637.72]  they've decided to no longer officially disclose
[3637.72 --> 3639.10]  per-core turbo frequencies,
[3639.22 --> 3639.56]  they said,
[3639.56 --> 3642.02]  we're no longer disclosing this level of detail
[3642.02 --> 3643.76]  as it is proprietary to Intel.
[3644.34 --> 3646.36]  Intel only specifies processor frequencies
[3646.36 --> 3647.98]  for base and single-core turbo
[3647.98 --> 3650.04]  in our processor marketing and technical collateral,
[3650.16 --> 3650.72]  such as ARC,
[3650.90 --> 3653.02]  and not the multi-core turbo frequencies.
[3653.18 --> 3654.94]  We're aligning communications to be consistent.
[3655.46 --> 3657.22]  All turbo frequencies are opportunistic
[3657.22 --> 3659.22]  given their dependency on system configuration
[3659.22 --> 3660.30]  and workload.
[3660.42 --> 3660.78]  BS.
[3662.64 --> 3663.58]  Pretty annoying.
[3663.58 --> 3665.82]  Basically, what you're doing
[3665.82 --> 3667.50]  is you're making us go measure it.
[3667.86 --> 3668.08]  Yeah.
[3668.20 --> 3668.46]  Why?
[3668.78 --> 3670.28]  Why are you wasting our time?
[3671.12 --> 3671.76]  This is like...
[3671.76 --> 3673.40]  This is like Apple not disclosing
[3673.40 --> 3674.96]  the capacity of their batteries
[3674.96 --> 3676.68]  to make someone take it apart.
[3677.34 --> 3677.78]  It's like,
[3677.88 --> 3679.60]  you're not concealing anything.
[3679.94 --> 3680.62]  We'll figure it out.
[3680.74 --> 3682.42]  You're just inconveniencing everybody
[3682.42 --> 3683.96]  for no reason.
[3684.10 --> 3685.46]  Literally not even reverse engineering.
[3685.68 --> 3687.14]  It's just trying something.
[3688.02 --> 3689.94]  Like, it's not difficult to figure out.
[3689.94 --> 3690.98]  I just can't even.
[3691.14 --> 3692.32]  It's just extremely annoying
[3692.32 --> 3693.52]  for all of the consumers.
[3696.84 --> 3699.10]  So, yeah, I guess that's
[3699.10 --> 3701.44]  all I really had to say about that.
[3701.48 --> 3702.20]  I'm sort of surprised.
[3702.40 --> 3704.22]  Okay, someone is posting salt in the chat.
[3704.48 --> 3706.42]  I was surprised people weren't doing salt tips.
[3707.04 --> 3707.58]  Salt tips.
[3707.90 --> 3709.62]  Did you see that clip?
[3710.06 --> 3710.32]  No.
[3710.54 --> 3711.46]  I ate salt,
[3711.66 --> 3712.52]  and it was a mistake.
[3712.92 --> 3714.44]  I didn't think it was going to be that bad,
[3714.80 --> 3716.08]  because I was talking about, like,
[3716.08 --> 3717.96]  people being salty about something.
[3717.96 --> 3718.60]  How much did you have?
[3718.86 --> 3719.64]  Well, there was, like,
[3719.66 --> 3720.60]  one of those big ones,
[3720.66 --> 3721.08]  and I was like,
[3721.20 --> 3721.46]  oh.
[3721.96 --> 3722.82]  No, no, it wasn't, like,
[3722.90 --> 3723.78]  fully open or anything,
[3723.92 --> 3725.26]  but, like, for a bit,
[3725.30 --> 3726.18]  I was actually okay,
[3726.28 --> 3727.22]  and I was going to just keep going
[3727.22 --> 3727.68]  with the video,
[3727.74 --> 3728.18]  and then it, like,
[3728.20 --> 3728.98]  hit me all at once.
[3729.02 --> 3730.02]  It was pretty bad.
[3730.12 --> 3731.60]  Because there's salts
[3731.60 --> 3733.06]  that you can eat.
[3733.82 --> 3734.50]  Like, if you get, like,
[3734.54 --> 3735.46]  salt mixes and stuff,
[3735.50 --> 3736.22]  you can have, like,
[3736.30 --> 3738.10]  a, what is the really small one?
[3738.14 --> 3738.52]  A tablespoon?
[3739.46 --> 3740.08]  Yeah, a teaspoon.
[3740.24 --> 3740.80]  Teaspoon, yeah.
[3742.74 --> 3744.08]  I'm not very, uh,
[3744.08 --> 3746.30]  up with the whole
[3746.30 --> 3747.46]  etiquette thing.
[3748.34 --> 3748.86]  Aim's gone.
[3751.10 --> 3751.50]  Okay.
[3755.00 --> 3756.22]  I'd be a lot more sad
[3756.22 --> 3757.10]  if this was, uh,
[3757.86 --> 3758.34]  MSN.
[3760.10 --> 3761.08]  Yeah, I was sad
[3761.08 --> 3761.88]  when this was MSN.
[3762.72 --> 3763.34]  There you go.
[3763.40 --> 3764.70]  I, like, had a dream
[3764.70 --> 3765.62]  about MSN,
[3765.96 --> 3766.38]  like,
[3767.38 --> 3768.68]  in the last three days.
[3768.78 --> 3769.60]  I don't remember exactly when.
[3770.30 --> 3770.80]  But, man,
[3770.80 --> 3772.22]  if it came back suddenly,
[3772.22 --> 3773.54]  I would jump on that train
[3773.54 --> 3774.52]  so fast,
[3774.64 --> 3775.58]  and then they would
[3775.58 --> 3776.90]  Skype-ify the crap out of it,
[3776.98 --> 3777.86]  and I would bail out
[3777.86 --> 3778.90]  so fast.
[3779.72 --> 3780.10]  Um,
[3780.94 --> 3782.72]  Microsoft Edge
[3782.72 --> 3783.94]  is coming to iOS and Android.
[3787.06 --> 3787.46]  Cool.
[3791.80 --> 3793.02]  I guess I can use that
[3793.02 --> 3793.44]  for, like,
[3793.50 --> 3794.54]  accounts that I don't want
[3794.54 --> 3795.20]  to have signed in
[3795.20 --> 3795.78]  on the other ones.
[3796.10 --> 3796.78]  I don't know.
[3797.78 --> 3798.18]  Um.
[3798.24 --> 3799.12]  I just used other browsers
[3799.12 --> 3799.52]  for that,
[3799.58 --> 3800.00]  so it's fine.
[3800.76 --> 3801.82]  And there's gonna be
[3801.82 --> 3802.48]  another Blackberry.
[3802.82 --> 3803.12]  Uh,
[3803.14 --> 3804.34]  there's a huge thing on this
[3804.34 --> 3805.20]  that we haven't talked
[3805.20 --> 3805.84]  about at all yet.
[3806.52 --> 3807.32]  Oh, right!
[3807.60 --> 3808.06]  On, like,
[3808.10 --> 3808.74]  any platform.
[3808.86 --> 3809.64]  Oh, wow!
[3809.70 --> 3810.08]  And we're doing it
[3810.08 --> 3810.90]  at the very end of the show
[3810.90 --> 3811.62]  when no one's watching.
[3811.72 --> 3812.50]  Holy crap,
[3812.60 --> 3813.18]  we suck!
[3813.78 --> 3814.36]  We're really,
[3814.48 --> 3815.10]  it's funny,
[3815.22 --> 3815.90]  because, uh,
[3815.96 --> 3816.40]  we're, like,
[3816.48 --> 3817.70]  in the advertising business,
[3817.80 --> 3818.62]  and then when we need
[3818.62 --> 3819.68]  to advertise our own things,
[3819.72 --> 3821.10]  we just suck at it.
[3821.14 --> 3821.48]  I know,
[3821.56 --> 3822.40]  we're not the greatest
[3822.40 --> 3823.02]  marketers.
[3823.64 --> 3824.00]  Um.
[3824.18 --> 3824.80]  Also known as, like,
[3824.82 --> 3826.26]  we often just don't market it.
[3826.26 --> 3826.62]  Anyway,
[3826.70 --> 3827.74]  there's a Blackberry phone
[3827.74 --> 3828.20]  that's coming.
[3828.50 --> 3828.94]  Oh, cool.
[3830.04 --> 3830.48]  Um.
[3831.64 --> 3832.54]  Holy crap,
[3832.64 --> 3833.46]  how have we not talked
[3833.46 --> 3834.02]  about this?
[3834.82 --> 3835.18]  Floatplane.
[3835.90 --> 3836.34]  Um.
[3836.78 --> 3837.90]  Kind of a big deal.
[3838.42 --> 3838.60]  Uh,
[3838.62 --> 3839.68]  Scrapyard Wars is up.
[3840.02 --> 3840.92]  People don't even believe
[3840.92 --> 3841.70]  me that it's there.
[3841.86 --> 3842.14]  Really?
[3842.42 --> 3842.68]  Yeah.
[3842.78 --> 3843.04]  Okay,
[3843.16 --> 3843.68]  now hold on,
[3843.74 --> 3844.38]  I got this.
[3844.46 --> 3845.46]  I will show the people.
[3845.46 --> 3845.74]  And, like,
[3845.76 --> 3846.50]  we don't have a trailer,
[3846.62 --> 3847.78]  we had a trailer for the,
[3847.78 --> 3848.24]  the, like,
[3848.90 --> 3850.06]  cleanup vlogs.
[3850.30 --> 3851.06]  We didn't get a trailer
[3851.06 --> 3852.06]  for Scrapyard Wars?
[3852.06 --> 3852.98]  Well, we're, like,
[3853.32 --> 3854.86]  we had to delay it a bit,
[3854.86 --> 3855.52]  so we're.
[3855.76 --> 3856.08]  Oh, yeah,
[3856.10 --> 3857.04]  it's a two-week window.
[3857.94 --> 3858.92]  A two-week window?
[3859.00 --> 3859.20]  Uh,
[3859.24 --> 3859.84]  long story.
[3860.10 --> 3860.36]  Oh.
[3860.82 --> 3861.52]  Long story,
[3861.80 --> 3862.18]  essentially,
[3862.34 --> 3862.96]  we have to,
[3863.20 --> 3863.44]  yeah.
[3863.62 --> 3864.64]  We could still have a trailer.
[3865.22 --> 3865.50]  Yeah,
[3865.54 --> 3866.68]  but it would be too early.
[3866.68 --> 3867.84]  Yeah,
[3867.90 --> 3868.10]  so,
[3868.22 --> 3868.34]  no,
[3868.42 --> 3868.56]  that,
[3868.62 --> 3868.74]  no,
[3868.82 --> 3869.42]  that makes sense.
[3869.44 --> 3869.54]  Well,
[3869.54 --> 3870.10]  we'd have a trailer
[3870.10 --> 3870.90]  for a float plane.
[3871.58 --> 3871.90]  Yeah,
[3871.92 --> 3873.20]  but we're gonna have it,
[3873.32 --> 3873.74]  um,
[3874.44 --> 3874.80]  uh,
[3874.80 --> 3875.54]  it,
[3875.66 --> 3875.86]  it,
[3875.86 --> 3876.20]  trust me,
[3876.22 --> 3876.76]  it makes sense.
[3876.90 --> 3876.92]  Okay,
[3876.92 --> 3877.06]  sure.
[3877.16 --> 3877.86]  We don't want to tease
[3877.86 --> 3878.78]  something two weeks
[3878.78 --> 3879.32]  in advance.
[3879.62 --> 3879.84]  Well,
[3879.92 --> 3880.56]  we want to tease it
[3880.56 --> 3881.28]  a week in advance.
[3881.28 --> 3881.86]  if they get it on float plane.
[3881.90 --> 3882.02]  No,
[3882.06 --> 3882.14]  no,
[3882.18 --> 3882.34]  but,
[3882.46 --> 3882.82]  um.
[3883.24 --> 3883.70]  I know.
[3884.08 --> 3884.44]  I get it.
[3884.44 --> 3884.62]  Yeah,
[3884.74 --> 3884.84]  we,
[3884.92 --> 3886.02]  we don't want to create
[3886.02 --> 3887.52]  more salt than we have to.
[3887.60 --> 3887.96]  I get it.
[3888.82 --> 3889.58]  But it's there.
[3889.90 --> 3889.96]  So,
[3889.96 --> 3890.58]  what do we got?
[3890.88 --> 3891.40]  TechWiki,
[3891.72 --> 3892.56]  bias lighting
[3892.56 --> 3894.24]  as fast as possible.
[3894.62 --> 3895.18]  That's a good thumbnail.
[3895.28 --> 3895.52]  It's pretty.
[3895.72 --> 3896.56]  That is actually pretty good.
[3896.80 --> 3897.82]  Behind the scenes
[3897.82 --> 3899.42]  demolition vlog.
[3900.42 --> 3900.74]  Yay.
[3900.94 --> 3901.16]  Dun,
[3901.28 --> 3901.50]  dun,
[3901.58 --> 3901.82]  dun.
[3901.88 --> 3902.02]  Oh,
[3902.06 --> 3902.16]  yeah,
[3902.20 --> 3903.18]  we demolished our sets,
[3903.46 --> 3904.32]  so that was a thing.
[3905.08 --> 3905.32]  Uh,
[3905.32 --> 3906.62]  this was a simultaneous release,
[3906.78 --> 3908.62]  the Core i7 8700K.
[3909.52 --> 3909.90]  So,
[3909.98 --> 3910.92]  you guys have probably seen that.
[3911.44 --> 3912.92]  The Ultimate Mega Workstation.
[3913.02 --> 3913.16]  Oh,
[3913.20 --> 3914.46]  I think that was a simultaneous release
[3914.46 --> 3915.58]  as well because of,
[3915.58 --> 3915.96]  um,
[3916.38 --> 3916.60]  uh,
[3916.60 --> 3917.80]  Cooler Master K sponsorship.
[3918.82 --> 3919.82]  Trackball Mouse Review.
[3920.12 --> 3920.50]  Yeah,
[3920.62 --> 3921.08]  I saw that.
[3921.08 --> 3921.90]  released a new trackball.
[3922.04 --> 3922.76]  It's kind of neat.
[3922.94 --> 3923.22]  Yeah.
[3923.36 --> 3924.48]  I wonder how well it's going to sell.
[3924.70 --> 3926.04]  I have no idea.
[3926.16 --> 3927.70]  Probably not particularly amazingly.
[3928.18 --> 3928.54]  Yeah,
[3928.56 --> 3928.84]  but like,
[3928.86 --> 3929.78]  I'm sure they're prepared for that.
[3929.86 --> 3929.96]  Like,
[3929.98 --> 3930.82]  I'm sure it'll all be fine.
[3931.26 --> 3932.16]  Scrapyard Wars.
[3932.70 --> 3933.16]  Heck yeah.
[3934.14 --> 3935.06]  Scrapyard Wars 6,
[3935.14 --> 3935.86]  part 1.
[3936.36 --> 3937.42]  Sponsored by Dbrand.
[3938.54 --> 3939.42]  Holy crap.
[3940.08 --> 3940.98]  Jay's 2 Cents.
[3941.30 --> 3942.00]  Holy crap.
[3942.08 --> 3943.36]  Dimitri from Hardware Canucks.
[3944.00 --> 3944.96]  Holy crap.
[3945.36 --> 3946.24]  Hold on a second.
[3946.38 --> 3946.96]  Hold on a second.
[3947.38 --> 3947.50]  I,
[3947.54 --> 3948.78]  I got like a quick spoiler.
[3949.32 --> 3950.08]  I got a quick spoiler.
[3950.08 --> 3951.10]  Uh,
[3951.44 --> 3952.06]  holy crap.
[3952.18 --> 3953.88]  You can hardly recognize Linus
[3953.88 --> 3955.66]  in this outfit.
[3957.22 --> 3959.62]  How will anyone ever recognize him on the street?
[3960.10 --> 3962.36]  He's going incognito.
[3962.90 --> 3963.76]  I love the glasses.
[3963.94 --> 3964.38]  Wait for it.
[3964.68 --> 3965.18]  It's coming.
[3967.18 --> 3968.40]  And he's gone.
[3968.66 --> 3969.88]  Incognito Linus.
[3969.98 --> 3970.38]  Gone.
[3970.38 --> 3971.24]  Um,
[3971.28 --> 3971.70]  so yeah,
[3971.78 --> 3972.38]  it's 40,
[3972.50 --> 3974.98]  42 minutes of Scrapyard Wars greatness,
[3975.24 --> 3977.96]  and the episodes are rolling out weekly on,
[3978.02 --> 3979.62]  I think it's either Saturdays or Sundays.
[3979.94 --> 3980.14]  So,
[3980.24 --> 3980.42]  um,
[3980.42 --> 3980.60]  yeah,
[3980.82 --> 3983.84]  get signed up for Flowplane if you guys want to be watching Scrapyard Wars.
[3984.24 --> 3984.62]  Right?
[3984.80 --> 3985.08]  Meow.

[3986.40 --> 3987.42]  Handy Tech Under 100.
[3987.58 --> 3988.42]  Stuff for your stuff.
[3988.80 --> 3989.04]  Oh,
[3989.12 --> 3989.32]  cool.
[3989.40 --> 3990.22]  Another one of those.
[3990.30 --> 3990.46]  Yep.
[3990.66 --> 3992.04]  We are finally bringing back Handy Tech.
[3992.12 --> 3993.44]  Stuff for your stuff?
[3993.70 --> 3994.08]  Um,
[3994.40 --> 3996.02]  this is a pretty cool product.
[3996.66 --> 4000.26]  That is actually the size of this entire computer that contains a GTX 1080.
[4001.28 --> 4001.68]  Oh.
[4002.22 --> 4002.54]  Yeah.
[4003.78 --> 4004.84]  That's really small.
[4004.86 --> 4006.12]  That's a 1080 for scale.
[4006.44 --> 4006.64]  Yeah,
[4006.70 --> 4006.86]  yeah.
[4006.98 --> 4007.80]  Is that it?
[4007.92 --> 4008.84]  Is that the card right there?
[4008.84 --> 4010.04]  This is the 1080 right here.
[4010.14 --> 4010.52]  Wow.
[4010.78 --> 4010.98]  Yeah,
[4011.14 --> 4011.68]  it's pretty cool.
[4012.38 --> 4012.82]  Um,
[4013.44 --> 4015.10]  deletting a thousand dollar CPU.
[4015.44 --> 4015.64]  Oh,
[4015.64 --> 4016.78]  is it worth the risk?
[4018.38 --> 4019.96]  What would you put the risk at?
[4020.00 --> 4021.46]  Too hot for a thousand dollars.
[4021.88 --> 4022.12]  No,
[4022.12 --> 4023.76]  I mean like percentage wise.
[4024.58 --> 4024.90]  Ah,
[4025.08 --> 4025.52]  ooh,
[4025.60 --> 4026.24]  hard to say.
[4026.44 --> 4026.66]  Yeah.
[4026.96 --> 4027.34]  Um,
[4027.36 --> 4028.70]  and last but not least,
[4029.72 --> 4032.20]  the full RGB water cooling system.
[4032.46 --> 4034.30]  Even the fittings are RGB.
[4034.70 --> 4036.76]  This is actually one of the better performing videos,
[4036.86 --> 4037.02]  like,
[4037.16 --> 4037.72]  of all time.
[4037.96 --> 4038.10]  Oh,
[4038.16 --> 4038.28]  wow.
[4038.38 --> 4039.42]  Deletting did really well too.
[4039.74 --> 4039.92]  Yeah.
[4040.00 --> 4040.46]  Um,
[4041.26 --> 4042.16]  this one too.
[4042.16 --> 4043.60]  What does scroll lock do?
[4043.70 --> 4044.78]  Killed it on TechQuickie.
[4045.14 --> 4045.62]  Or,
[4045.74 --> 4046.22]  killed it on,
[4046.26 --> 4046.38]  uh,
[4046.38 --> 4046.76]  floatplane.
[4048.44 --> 4048.84]  So,
[4048.96 --> 4049.32]  guys,
[4049.52 --> 4049.76]  uh,
[4049.80 --> 4050.02]  Joe,
[4050.16 --> 4050.90]  go join,
[4051.38 --> 4052.10]  go join the
[4052.12 --> 4052.56]  plane.
[4052.70 --> 4053.14]  Joe join.
[4053.30 --> 4053.72]  The club.
[4053.84 --> 4055.04]  It's not going to be called a club anymore.
[4055.22 --> 4055.44]  Nope.
[4055.50 --> 4055.78]  We gotta,
[4055.88 --> 4056.78]  we gotta get out of the habit.
[4056.94 --> 4057.14]  We don't,
[4057.20 --> 4058.00]  don't say join the club.
[4058.14 --> 4058.84]  Just get on the plane.
[4059.00 --> 4059.60]  Get on the plane.
[4059.68 --> 4059.92]  Just,
[4059.98 --> 4060.18]  uh,
[4060.18 --> 4061.08]  get your pilot's license.
[4061.32 --> 4062.08]  Just get on the plane,
[4062.18 --> 4062.42]  man.
[4063.10 --> 4063.54]  Um,
[4063.82 --> 4064.62]  so head over there.
[4064.76 --> 4066.30]  It is three bucks a month.
[4066.40 --> 4070.58]  We cannot promise that that pricing will remain after the launch.
[4070.58 --> 4071.58]  Um,
[4071.74 --> 4073.06]  when it goes on to the other site.
[4073.06 --> 4074.18]  We can mostly promise that it won't.
[4074.54 --> 4074.72]  Yeah,
[4074.78 --> 4075.14]  it won't.
[4075.50 --> 4075.74]  Yeah.
[4076.16 --> 4076.52]  So,
[4076.88 --> 4081.12]  you should probably be on floatplane before the site launches.
[4081.48 --> 4085.90]  And we do not intend to announce when the site will launch because we're big douches.
[4086.06 --> 4086.30]  Yeah.
[4087.26 --> 4088.46]  We totally could,
[4088.68 --> 4089.44]  but we won't.
[4089.54 --> 4089.72]  Yep.
[4089.72 --> 4091.90]  So get on there.
[4092.60 --> 4093.12]  All right,
[4093.16 --> 4093.48]  guys.
[4093.56 --> 4094.92]  Thanks for tuning into the WAN show.
[4095.00 --> 4096.00]  We'll see you again next week.
[4096.10 --> 4096.90]  Same bat time,
[4097.02 --> 4098.48]  same bat channel.
[4099.26 --> 4099.54]  Bye.
[4104.04 --> 4104.36]  Okay.
[4104.44 --> 4105.02]  Do you mind,
[4105.08 --> 4105.50]  um,
[4105.76 --> 4106.82]  getting the merch?
[4106.96 --> 4107.14]  Also,
[4107.22 --> 4108.32]  I haven't even ended the stream yet,
[4108.38 --> 4110.10]  but I got to go finish shooting that thing with you.
[4110.14 --> 4110.40]  Okay.
[4110.54 --> 4112.04]  I'm also going to try to find a time for us.
[4112.06 --> 4112.58]  Are you still down?
[4112.76 --> 4113.00]  Yeah,
[4113.08 --> 4114.02]  I'm totally still down.
[4114.12 --> 4114.36]  Okay.
[4116.26 --> 4116.70]  Cause I,
[4117.26 --> 4118.96]  we definitely haven't figured out a time yet.
[4118.96 --> 4119.44]  Oh yeah,
[4119.44 --> 4120.02]  I'm sure there's some.
[4120.02 --> 4120.82]  I'm sure it'll be fine.
[4120.94 --> 4121.06]  Yeah.
[4121.08 --> 4122.30]  Probably like a 730.
[4122.44 --> 4124.74]  We can go get some fast food and then head over there.
[4124.82 --> 4125.46]  Fresh books.
[4125.54 --> 4126.10]  That works for me.
[4126.14 --> 4126.40]  Sounds good?
[4126.56 --> 4126.74]  Yep.
[4126.88 --> 4127.08]  Cool.
[4127.50 --> 4128.02]  Synergy.
[4129.30 --> 4130.10]  Bye everyone.
[4130.50 --> 4131.34]  I'm going to reset this.
[4131.36 --> 4134.90]  We haven't just hung out outside of work in like probably like over a year.
[4134.96 --> 4135.66]  So long.
[4136.54 --> 4139.78]  I didn't know the last time was when you came over and we talked in the living room.
[4140.38 --> 4143.86]  And then the time before that was when you came over and we wrote out on World's Most Comfortable.
[4144.64 --> 4144.88]  Yeah.
[4144.88 --> 4146.02]  It was like a year ago.
[4146.02 --> 4146.50]  Yeah.
[4147.88 --> 4148.66]  Bye everyone.
[4148.96 --> 4150.96]  Bye.
[4159.60 --> 4160.00]  And.
[4164.34 --> 4164.66]  Bye.
[4177.00 --> 4177.86]  Bye.
[4177.86 --> 4178.06]  Bye.
