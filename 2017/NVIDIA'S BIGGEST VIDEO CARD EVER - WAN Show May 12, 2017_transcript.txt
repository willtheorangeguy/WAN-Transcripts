[0.00 --> 7.00]  All right ladies and gentlemen welcome to the WAN show
[9.76 --> 11.76]  It was a joke
[12.96 --> 18.18]  What was that that that bit there that I just did oh I mean this isn't the WAN show no no there
[18.18 --> 20.82]  It is the WAN show and they are welcome there just aren't any ladies
[24.34 --> 26.34]  We've got a great show for you guys today
[26.34 --> 30.66]  Intel is rumored to be working on core i9
[31.96 --> 33.96]  processors so
[33.96 --> 38.32]  Wow, that's been what seven years in the works since the original rumors
[38.32 --> 44.44]  Maybe this will finally be over four cores on a consumer deck and video announces the first
[44.96 --> 50.72]  Well, what do we call it? We can't call it a video card because it won't even have like video outputs
[50.72 --> 55.34]  But but but it's a it's a GPU, okay first Volta GPU
[55.34 --> 59.90]  It's the biggest they've ever made and what else we got here?
[59.90 --> 65.26]  I don't know where it went, but maybe that's part of the whole deal there's all here it is
[65.26 --> 74.34]  There's a nsa derived ransomware worm that is just going everywhere and screwing huge companies over and it's it's scary and bad
[74.34 --> 76.34]  And we'll talk about that also
[76.34 --> 83.46]  So where did it go the uk police start using minority report esque ai to help decide the fate of inmates
[84.58 --> 92.58]  Really apparently all right, so let's roll that intro and hopefully the world is still here when we come back
[92.58 --> 93.22]  Yeah
[93.22 --> 95.22]  No guarantees though
[95.22 --> 97.22]  harm assessment risk to heart
[98.34 --> 100.34]  Huh
[100.34 --> 102.34]  Oh
[102.34 --> 120.02]  Yeah, LTX 2017 tech carnival
[120.02 --> 129.14]  Hooray get conned on saturday july 29th 2017 tickets on sale now at wow really what a good link
[129.94 --> 131.94]  We decided not to shorten that at all
[131.94 --> 139.06]  What is ticket rocket dot co slash event slash detail slash nine seven two four six slash ltx dash 2017
[139.06 --> 142.10]  If you can remember that heck yeah, yeah, cuz it's gone
[142.82 --> 143.94]  Squarespace
[143.94 --> 145.94]  What is dot co I?
[147.62 --> 152.42]  Mean I know dot co dot uk but what oh wait hold on all right?
[152.42 --> 154.42]  Oh wait no
[155.86 --> 161.86]  Everything's for the show's over now you played it twice. Oh crap. Okay. Well, thanks for tuning in see you again next week
[162.74 --> 168.10]  Okay, but in all seriousness we have some huge news now that James underscore gravity
[168.10 --> 171.70]  So that's at James underscore gravity on Twitter is off probation
[171.70 --> 179.46]  He will reply to all emoji sentences with an emoji sentence only tweets from now till Sunday count
[179.62 --> 182.26]  I guess this has been creating problems for him
[183.06 --> 187.70]  Actually getting too many people sending nonsense with with his at tag
[188.18 --> 189.30]  added
[189.30 --> 192.82]  Also in other very have anything to do with being off probation
[194.42 --> 199.62]  He just is excited. I I get it. Okay. I get it. I mean were you excited when you were off probation?
[199.62 --> 202.34]  I didn't have to check in with your officer anymore
[203.54 --> 206.10]  I was gonna say I don't think I even like officially had one
[206.10 --> 208.82]  Oh, did your mom even know about that? She watches this show doesn't she?
[208.82 --> 211.30]  Oh, yeah, no she I didn't tell her about that. Sorry mom
[211.78 --> 217.30]  We'll talk about that later. I had other important news too. I forget what it was though. I guess it couldn't have been that important
[217.62 --> 219.14]  Oh, yes
[219.14 --> 223.94]  Brandon has brought the world's most horrendous snack
[223.94 --> 225.94]  You're wrong
[225.94 --> 227.94]  Into this office. Oh, thank you
[227.94 --> 232.02]  So he pulls me over onto a set to do like a
[233.46 --> 237.70]  And this is okay. This is not a sponsored bit. No, this stuff is trash
[238.34 --> 240.34]  Complete and absolute trash
[240.66 --> 244.42]  Nongshim you should never produce no get out of here
[244.42 --> 246.42]  That's not true
[247.22 --> 249.22]  Trash okay
[249.30 --> 252.82]  Sorry, I'm covering you up. I'm just like trash. No, it's trash cover it up
[252.82 --> 253.38]  At least you're
[253.38 --> 254.26]  Oh
[254.26 --> 255.14]  Oh
[255.14 --> 255.70]  rude
[255.70 --> 263.06]  So he brings me over there to to do like a like a bit for b-roll. He's like look relaxed look lazy
[263.06 --> 267.54]  So I'm sitting on the couch with my my bag of what is presumably actually food
[267.54 --> 273.14]  Ha ha ha on my on my tummy. I go and I grab one. I throw it in my mouth. I'm just like
[275.22 --> 278.18]  I swear just about tossed it
[279.14 --> 284.98]  These are disgusting okay, so there's a concept there's a concept that I call here
[284.98 --> 290.48]  Why don't you um why don't you why don't you grab a couple throw them in your mouth? We'll get here. You're drifting
[292.34 --> 297.46]  There we go, okay, okay, so there's a concept that I call I actually learned this from my old boss
[297.54 --> 300.02]  At NCIX. They don't smell as bad as they taste
[300.98 --> 305.70]  Called calorie worthy hold on can I have this back there's some nutritional facts on these things
[305.70 --> 312.42]  So it's one thing for something to have 20% of your daily fat intake
[313.38 --> 315.38]  per 50 grams
[315.86 --> 321.22]  And there's another thing all together for it to taste like absolute garbage at the same time
[321.94 --> 324.98]  Okay, to be fair like they don't taste great, but they just don't taste like anything
[324.98 --> 331.30]  I don't know how you had a strong reaction you don't taste like I can like rotting ocean
[332.42 --> 337.14]  Yeah, and your breath is gonna be like I think I smell like that ocean savage
[337.14 --> 341.22]  I'm not gonna have any more because I don't want to scare people away from the block away, but
[342.02 --> 346.36]  Like I can smell it really strongly now that I eat it, but like it tastes like
[346.36 --> 352.52]  Like really really really thin airy rice crispy or not rice crispy uh
[353.72 --> 355.96]  What are those called? It's made out of rice crispy stuff?
[355.96 --> 362.52]  I think like rice crackers. Yeah, yeah, so tastes like rice crackers with an infusion of rotting shrimp
[363.40 --> 365.80]  Yeah, a little bit absolutely disgusting
[365.80 --> 368.36]  But it's not super strong like I don't did you gag on it?
[369.16 --> 375.00]  Almost almost gagged definitely had to spit it out. I didn't try to swallow it like I didn't I didn't have that reaction
[375.00 --> 377.40]  Oh, I cannot eat that trash. That's horrible
[378.44 --> 381.72]  All right the smell the smell the smell turns me off it completely
[382.92 --> 387.48]  That is not a good smell. Okay, um this was originally posted by
[388.36 --> 390.36]  Kamesh SS on the forum
[391.08 --> 396.60]  Intel is rumored to be working on wait. What what form is this? Oh, this is a non tech forum
[397.00 --> 400.92]  Okay, very Intel is rumored to be working on core i9
[401.64 --> 405.32]  processors, so let's go ahead and pull up this exclusive
[406.36 --> 411.32]  Post in the anantech forum by sweeper the diamond member and oh whoops
[411.48 --> 417.16]  It helps if I plug in my laptop dang it. I've got a diamond member. Do you have a diamond member sounds hard?
[417.48 --> 421.48]  Yeah, rock hard diamond hard the hardest. Yeah
[422.68 --> 424.68]  There we go. Okay, that's better
[424.92 --> 431.16]  So this is the rumored sky lake x lineup core i9 7920x
[431.80 --> 433.96]  Whatever that means core i9
[434.84 --> 436.12]  7900x
[436.36 --> 440.92]  So apparently they all have x's that's 12 cores and oh oh
[441.56 --> 447.00]  They're all extreme are they all it's so everything core i9 is extreme. Does that make sense to you? No
[447.64 --> 454.44]  You know what though? What i'll say is these specs actually look like they make a fair bit of sense. I don't know about the names
[455.32 --> 458.76]  But 12 core 24 thread based on what we know about sky lake
[459.80 --> 465.56]  And it's improved power profile versus broadwell that probably makes sense for a new extreme edition
[466.20 --> 466.76]  and then
[466.76 --> 473.48]  This generation they went okay two cores down and otherwise mostly unaffected
[473.96 --> 481.32]  um with really good you know turbo speeds or whatever so as a as a so we've got a 6950x and we've got a
[481.80 --> 485.64]  6900k right now so these look like the replacements there we got a 12 and a 10 core
[486.36 --> 486.76]  um
[487.64 --> 490.04]  Which is cool more cores i'm never gonna say no to that
[490.84 --> 493.24]  then moving down this is where
[494.36 --> 500.20]  I don't like it but it starts to make again a lot of sense core that's an x though
[500.92 --> 504.04]  Yeah, so it looks like they're changing it so that anything
[504.92 --> 505.56]  um
[505.56 --> 506.76]  h-e-d-t
[506.76 --> 510.20]  High-end desktop so that's lga's 1366
[510.52 --> 514.60]  2011 2011 3 and then I forget what this one's gonna be but it's the one that's coming
[515.08 --> 520.20]  Um it looks like those are all gonna be x and all going to be core i9 now
[521.16 --> 521.56]  um
[521.56 --> 529.64]  So these next two down which will probably be like the the the 700 and the like 500 450 500 one
[530.28 --> 532.28]  look like they're gonna be eight and
[532.68 --> 536.28]  Six core with only 28 pci e lanes
[536.84 --> 542.04]  And with the six core really getting kicked in the teeth as far as turbo boost goes
[542.28 --> 546.04]  So it's not getting a new turbo 3.0. This is all rumored though
[546.04 --> 553.64]  And then this is a fairly well substantiated rumor that we're gonna get a like a kb lake x
[554.76 --> 561.40]  On the high-end desktop platform that and I I don't get these skews at all like at all
[561.88 --> 564.84]  But they're basically going to be higher tdp
[566.28 --> 567.24]  core i7
[567.24 --> 569.80]  7700 k's
[569.80 --> 572.20]  And 70 core i5 7600 k
[573.16 --> 575.88]  That are called 77 40 that you
[575.88 --> 582.20]  Have to have a much more expensive motherboard in order to install same pci e lanes
[583.00 --> 585.00]  Same size cache
[585.00 --> 590.04]  Four cores four threads for the i5 or oh, I guess it's an i7 it's an i7 with
[590.92 --> 592.52]  No hyper threading
[592.52 --> 597.00]  But i'm finally gonna have to wait what i'm finally gonna have i didn't even notice that on the bottom one
[597.00 --> 599.00]  I'm gonna have to redo that video now
[599.56 --> 600.68]  um
[600.68 --> 606.52]  And then four cores eight threads on the on the ice on the actual i7 that's that yeah, I don't I don't get this
[608.44 --> 610.36]  So I don't know if you remember this
[610.36 --> 613.80]  But back when intel split the lineups
[614.20 --> 618.76]  So lga 775 was the last time we had extreme edition
[619.48 --> 623.40]  All the way down to celeron yeah on the same socket yeah
[623.96 --> 624.60]  um
[624.60 --> 628.44]  Then what happened was intel launched lga 1156
[630.52 --> 632.12]  So that was linfield
[633.08 --> 638.12]  And what happened with lga 1156 was that all of a sudden we got this um
[639.80 --> 645.00]  Wait hold on let me think for a second was it 1156 first or did they launch 1366 first
[645.00 --> 648.52]  Uh-oh i might be getting myself into trouble here
[652.76 --> 655.88]  Sorry, what's that it was 1366 first
[657.56 --> 666.04]  And then what happened was they launched 1156 and then they we so we got linfield and then we got what what was it ivy bridge after linfield
[666.04 --> 666.60]  No
[666.60 --> 673.48]  Sandy bridge sandy bridge was the first one to switch it up so sandy bridge switched it up right and sandy bridge was on the same platform as
[673.48 --> 675.48]  Linfield
[675.48 --> 677.16]  Ah
[677.16 --> 682.52]  Dang it i'm getting my intel history mixed up you know what why don't you do another topic well i double check this stuff
[682.52 --> 686.28]  Okay, and then we'll uh we'll get back to it i'm pretty sure everything john just said was right though
[686.28 --> 692.04]  I i am i am too but i also just want to uh i couldn't really hear him very well anyway
[692.04 --> 697.96]  And if i just put it in front of me and then i will feel better sure a lot of these are like either big topics
[698.68 --> 700.68]  Yeah, no that's okay
[700.68 --> 702.68]  NVIDIA releases geforce experience
[702.68 --> 712.84]  3.6 that's news apparently posted by the dark potato shadow play now supports additional rendering apis including opengl and vulcan
[713.32 --> 717.96]  And the usability has been streamlined apparently allowing easy uploads to facebook
[717.96 --> 728.04]  If you wanted to do that uh twitch and google from an improved overlay but probably still is taking telemetry data
[728.04 --> 733.08]  Um to a certain degree and still requires a full login to use
[733.72 --> 741.00]  Um so i will still continue to not have it on any of my computers so it's not going to help me at all
[741.00 --> 750.76]  Okay, okay, here we go. Yeah, so so lga 1366 here we go. So we had 775 everything was unified
[751.00 --> 752.12]  We got lga 11
[753.08 --> 755.00]  lga 1366
[755.00 --> 762.68]  Which was this bonafide higher-end platform it had triple channel memory it had more pci e lanes my dad still runs it
[762.68 --> 770.36]  Um at some point later on it ended up getting up to six core processors which was
[770.92 --> 775.00]  Pretty darn dope af as the kids say
[775.00 --> 780.84]  Um in fact the core i7 uh 980x i believe it was called
[781.56 --> 782.28]  Here we go
[783.00 --> 783.64]  That one
[785.24 --> 792.92]  Launched q1 2010 so i believe that came out right with the platform launch as i recall anyway
[793.48 --> 800.68]  So bonafide higher-end platform then we got clarkdale and linfield on lga 1156
[800.68 --> 808.12]  Then what intel did was they gave us the consumer upgrade to that which was sandy bridge
[808.92 --> 813.48]  First before giving us sandy bridge e on lga
[814.76 --> 821.56]  2011 if i recall correctly again oh wow i really hope i'm not making another mistake did we get sandy bridge e on
[821.88 --> 826.68]  1366 this is terrible this is the worst wandshow segment that i have ever done
[826.68 --> 833.32]  I was too poor to care about these ever done at that time well it was my job to sell it so um
[834.04 --> 835.64]  So it definitely
[835.64 --> 838.28]  Yeah, so we got uh we got in a halem
[839.08 --> 841.08]  And then uh
[843.00 --> 848.68]  Wow this is oh this is incredibly unhelpful microsoft unveiled a windows mixed reality controller
[849.48 --> 856.52]  Thing microsoft has announced controllers to support new mixed reality and vr headsets coming from the likes of acer and hp
[857.08 --> 864.20]  The controllers will rely on inside out tracking technology so you won't need to set up any special sensors around your room in order to actually use them
[864.92 --> 873.16]  They have a thumbstick like the oculus touch a touchpad like the vive and a wand like design with a tracking ring on the end
[873.16 --> 875.32]  I don't think we're gonna be able to get this on stream um
[876.68 --> 878.28]  Acer will offer them
[878.84 --> 884.20]  Bundled together with its windows vr headset for a 100 premium. Yeah, no i do i have you
[884.20 --> 890.28]  Uh, oh i see give me a second yes, we got this there
[893.24 --> 896.04]  So they look kind of like a hybrid almost
[898.04 --> 900.04]  It's interesting
[900.04 --> 902.92]  Okay, they sort of look like someone was like hey
[903.88 --> 910.04]  We're the new players. Maybe if we just wedge ourselves exactly in between we'll see if we can do okay
[911.88 --> 915.48]  Because they look they look like vive controllers that someone tried to like
[916.28 --> 918.52]  Wrench an oculus controller on to yeah
[919.80 --> 923.08]  If they're light they could be pretty comfortable they got to get the weighting right
[923.80 --> 927.72]  And it's hard to say like if the base of the handle would had kind of some heft to it
[927.72 --> 931.16]  Like if that's where the battery is yeah, then I could I could kind of see this uh
[931.64 --> 933.64]  I could kind of see this being okay
[935.00 --> 937.00]  Okay, so anyway, yes
[937.40 --> 937.96]  Um
[937.96 --> 939.96]  Go back for one quick second. Oh
[940.68 --> 949.72]  Yes, and here is pictured the Acer VR headset. Oh, so I've talked to Acer about this right now dev kits only they are not seating them to press
[950.76 --> 955.56]  But we are definitely interested in getting our hands on one of these to check out
[955.56 --> 958.92]  I at the Acer event that I was at in New York
[959.88 --> 962.36]  Microsoft's like head AR guy
[963.08 --> 969.00]  Came on and was talking about how this headset is apparently actually pretty fantastic. Yeah
[969.00 --> 975.56]  Um, so I don't know. I mean it's a keynote so like who knows yeah, it could be nonsense, but uh
[976.20 --> 982.76]  There you go. There's someone somewhat credible who came and said a thing that might be believable. Yeah, um, okay
[983.00 --> 987.24]  Okay, okay, so yes, I was right. So sandy bridge II went on to socket
[987.80 --> 989.00]  2011
[989.00 --> 993.96]  Uh, and that happened after we had gotten sandy bridge architecture on the mainstream platform
[994.60 --> 996.92]  Anyway, the whole point of all of that
[998.28 --> 1003.32]  Was the rumor the word on the street was that for lga
[1004.44 --> 1005.16]  1366
[1005.16 --> 1011.32]  It was rumored that in addition to the core i7 920
[1012.60 --> 1013.96]  930 and
[1013.96 --> 1020.04]  Oh, I don't want to get this wrong. I don't remember if the 950 came later, whatever whatever the launch lineup was
[1020.52 --> 1022.52]  They were all core i7s
[1022.60 --> 1027.08]  The rumor was that there was going to be a higher end core i9
[1028.04 --> 1028.44]  Okay
[1028.44 --> 1035.16]  And that never did materialize we did get extreme edition
[1035.48 --> 1037.24]  Dual socket platforms
[1037.24 --> 1042.84]  But intel never formally called those core i9 those ended up with names like uh
[1043.48 --> 1045.24]  I think it was core i7
[1045.24 --> 1047.24]  9775
[1047.24 --> 1049.56]  Was the end of qx no qx
[1050.12 --> 1052.60]  9775 was the end of uh
[1052.60 --> 1061.00]  Uh, actually that was on lga 771 so what was uh what was uh what was the one after after skull trail
[1062.36 --> 1063.32]  I think it was just
[1063.32 --> 1064.44]  I was tuned out trying to find a new
[1064.44 --> 1066.52]  Yeah, so after that so
[1067.08 --> 1073.96]  You were basically just expected to put uh zeons in them as I recall correctly so evga sr2
[1073.96 --> 1079.16]  So they had the classified sr2 it was dual 1366
[1079.72 --> 1084.52]  But people basically just put zeons in them so there you go. That's what that's what went down there
[1085.40 --> 1085.88]  um
[1087.16 --> 1091.00]  So finally core i9 is raising its head again and
[1091.72 --> 1094.52]  Maybe we will see a core i9 but maybe not
[1095.08 --> 1099.08]  I've also seen other rumors that have suggested that it's just going to be more core i7s
[1099.08 --> 1104.84]  But I think that would oh man the lineup is getting so confusing here
[1104.84 --> 1105.24]  Yes
[1105.24 --> 1107.48]  If there's any truth to this rumor whatsoever
[1108.28 --> 1108.92]  It's going to be like
[1109.72 --> 1110.92]  What is a core i5?
[1110.92 --> 1112.76]  You know what though? There's another way to look at this
[1113.08 --> 1113.56]  Uh-huh
[1113.56 --> 1115.08]  This is very good for us
[1117.64 --> 1119.24]  This is fantastic for us
[1119.72 --> 1126.76]  This is terrible for like almost everyone else but like us and paul and kyle and dimitri and other like tech youtube people
[1126.76 --> 1130.04]  Fantastic written article people great
[1131.24 --> 1132.60]  So everybody wins
[1133.64 --> 1136.68]  Except except for all of the consumers okay?
[1138.12 --> 1139.48]  Well, I guess i'm okay with that
[1140.76 --> 1143.48]  Because we're gonna have to make videos explaining what the hell is going on
[1143.72 --> 1147.16]  There's probably going to be a tech rookie video explaining what the heck an i9 is
[1147.16 --> 1148.52]  I'm gonna have to up everything else
[1148.52 --> 1150.60]  I'm gonna have to completely redo that video
[1150.60 --> 1152.92]  John is gonna have to completely redo that video
[1152.92 --> 1158.52]  A big explanation of the technical overview of these processors when it comes out is gonna have to be like
[1158.52 --> 1163.48]  Okay, what the heck even is this you can check out the tech rookie video, but here's a short explanation blah blah blah
[1164.20 --> 1172.60]  All right, let's get into we actually don't always talk about you know the security exploit du jour on the wandshow
[1172.68 --> 1175.88]  Just because you know there are other publications that I think
[1175.88 --> 1181.00]  I think handle that kind of security stuff a little bit more in depth than we don't with than we do yeah
[1181.24 --> 1182.68]  We're not going to dive into it as far
[1182.68 --> 1183.48]  But this
[1183.48 --> 1188.84]  Posted originally on the forum by master disaster the original article here is from ours technica is
[1189.72 --> 1193.64]  Sort of a big deal okay drop a knowledge bomb luke here we go
[1193.64 --> 1196.36]  So there's a bunch of different things going on with this
[1196.36 --> 1201.72]  I actually don't know enough about it to be completely honest, but if you want like springboard points
[1201.72 --> 1206.60]  uh, wanna cryptor it was spotted a few weeks ago the ransomware was
[1207.64 --> 1215.24]  Not really distributed that much and then suddenly wanna cryptor exploded and began spreading like wildfire through an export called eternal blue
[1215.96 --> 1221.72]  One thing that's freaky with all this kind of stuff is a lot of it's derived from nsa tech and it's ransomware
[1221.80 --> 1225.32]  So big companies are getting hit their servers getting locked down encrypted
[1225.32 --> 1233.24]  And the key is being sold to them for I believe it's like three hundred dollars, but then who the heck knows if that even works
[1233.80 --> 1238.28]  Yep, that's like the core concept of the whole issue, and it's being distributed like a worm
[1238.68 --> 1242.52]  So it's spreading extremely fast hitting a ton of I think it's
[1242.52 --> 1246.28]  Why don't you explain how a worm works for the viewers who don't know that's a really
[1247.16 --> 1249.16]  Kind of a big topic
[1249.16 --> 1258.44]  Okay, that's fine. I mean the the the the 30 second sort of a worm versus like opening up an attachment on your computer
[1258.44 --> 1263.96]  It's gonna try to grow itself and it's gonna try to travel around and expand by itself
[1263.96 --> 1268.68]  It's not it's not like a targeted attack. They're not going we want linus tech tips servers
[1268.68 --> 1272.76]  I'm gonna try to hit this dude with it. They're letting it try to crawl around on its own
[1273.40 --> 1275.40]  got it so
[1275.40 --> 1283.64]  Organizations in at least 74 countries have been affected with russia being disproportionately affected followed by ukraine india and taiwan
[1284.12 --> 1289.16]  It is spreading at a rate of about a hundred ips per minute now
[1289.16 --> 1296.60]  There is an insane amount of ips out there, but that is really fast. Uh, they're demanding like I said about 300 to 600 dollars paid in bitcoin
[1297.16 --> 1298.12]  unsurprisingly
[1298.12 --> 1300.12]  um by may 15th
[1301.00 --> 1304.68]  Or if you miss that deadline there will apparently be a higher fee by may 19th
[1304.68 --> 1308.28]  And the messages left on the screen say files will remain encrypted
[1308.28 --> 1314.36]  It's not clear if there are flaws in the encryption scheme that might allow the victims to restore the files without paying the ransom
[1314.36 --> 1316.36]  It's a little unlikely I'd say
[1316.92 --> 1320.36]  According to an article posted by Madrid based el mundo
[1320.92 --> 1328.28]  85% of computers at telephonica spain's dominant telecom are affected by the worm although that has not been confirmed
[1329.64 --> 1330.84]  woo
[1330.84 --> 1332.84]  Wow, so
[1332.84 --> 1334.84]  basically, um
[1336.36 --> 1338.36]  I set up snapshotting
[1340.92 --> 1344.36]  I hadn't gotten around to it yet on the vault. Yeah, um
[1345.16 --> 1345.96]  So that's a thing
[1347.56 --> 1348.12]  uh, so
[1348.92 --> 1353.96]  Actually, I guess this this leads us to a pretty good discussion I guess around how to protect yourself
[1354.52 --> 1360.04]  Against ransomware. Yeah, so one of the ways in fact, we just the most effective way
[1360.04 --> 1363.48]  Is what snapshot snapshot is good?
[1363.48 --> 1369.56]  But you it would be very helpful if you saved snapshots on a service that wasn't always connected
[1369.56 --> 1371.48]  Sure, because it's a worm so it could just
[1372.28 --> 1379.32]  Potentially encrypt both of them then you have two ransomware machines. Um, okay, so the way okay, so okay, okay, okay
[1379.32 --> 1381.32]  So let's back up a little bit snapshotting
[1381.80 --> 1383.80]  What it does is without?
[1384.20 --> 1385.00]  um
[1385.00 --> 1388.04]  Without creating a completely separate copy like
[1388.68 --> 1389.80]  snapshotting a
[1390.44 --> 1390.84]  70
[1391.64 --> 1393.16]  Let's see. How big is the vault right now?
[1393.16 --> 1396.44]  160 terabytes is how much data we're actually using right now
[1396.84 --> 1399.24]  snapshotting a 160 terabyte
[1399.96 --> 1400.84]  um
[1400.84 --> 1402.36]  share
[1402.36 --> 1408.68]  By duplicating it would be super dumb. Yeah, like using up
[1409.32 --> 1415.80]  320 terabytes of space just to have another copy would be bad. Yeah, but that's not how it works
[1416.36 --> 1420.76]  The way it works is it actually only logs changes
[1421.32 --> 1425.32]  So you have the original one and then you have logged changes after that. That's right
[1425.32 --> 1430.68]  So let's say I deleted a one terabyte folder from my 160 terabytes
[1431.24 --> 1433.24]  That means that
[1433.24 --> 1438.04]  Okay, apparently the national health service was affected and lots of data has been lost
[1439.80 --> 1440.68]  Wow
[1440.68 --> 1442.68]  lots of patient data
[1442.68 --> 1444.20]  wow
[1444.20 --> 1445.16]  Okay
[1445.16 --> 1447.56]  Okay, so back to back to how to protect yourself
[1447.56 --> 1453.48]  Okay, so what snapshotting does is let's say I deleted what a one terabyte folder from my 160
[1453.48 --> 1454.52]  until
[1454.52 --> 1458.68]  I reach the end of how long I want to keep my snapshots
[1459.00 --> 1461.32]  So you set up a profile like say for example
[1461.32 --> 1467.64]  You snapshot every hour for 24 hours and then every day for seven days and every week for four weeks. That would be a pretty
[1468.52 --> 1470.12]  typical sort of
[1471.24 --> 1475.00]  Loadout and then every month for 12 months people might do something along those lines
[1475.72 --> 1482.04]  So until that terabyte folder that I deleted reaches the end of all of my retention
[1482.04 --> 1484.04]  sort of um
[1484.20 --> 1485.24]  Set up
[1485.24 --> 1486.20]  uh reaches on the
[1487.32 --> 1491.88]  Huh one big thing to pay attention to here is if you're snapshotting everything yes
[1491.96 --> 1497.24]  Um, you want to make sure that whatever you're putting it on I was going to explain that but my brain is dumb
[1499.24 --> 1501.80]  Okay, okay, okay, okay, so total space on disk
[1502.92 --> 1504.36]  You don't get to get rid of stuff
[1504.36 --> 1509.40]  You've deleted until after it's like falling off the end of how long you retain your snapshots there. That's what I was going for
[1509.40 --> 1511.24]  Well, I just am clearly unqualified
[1511.24 --> 1520.44]  So basically the way that it works on our servers is that the snapshotting is done on the zfs pool level
[1521.56 --> 1525.32]  And then the way that the data is actually visible
[1525.96 --> 1528.76]  Over our network is through a samba share
[1528.76 --> 1534.92]  So we are snapshotting the pool so the snapshots themselves are never actually
[1536.04 --> 1536.60]  visible
[1538.60 --> 1541.56]  To anything that is connected to our server via the network
[1542.20 --> 1548.28]  So that's one way that you can decouple your snapshotting solution from
[1549.08 --> 1555.16]  Computers on the network that because it's a worm and it spreads over the network could otherwise infect it and encrypt it
[1555.16 --> 1560.36]  Because if you think that you're keeping your data safe just by having it on a nas
[1561.48 --> 1566.44]  That is not the case at all something that gets especially not right now something that gets onto your computer
[1566.68 --> 1570.36]  If that computer and that user that's logged in on your computer
[1570.76 --> 1576.12]  Has right access to that share it can do whatever it wants to it
[1576.68 --> 1578.68]  Including encrypting the data
[1578.68 --> 1580.12]  Did I get there eventually?
[1580.12 --> 1583.40]  I think so and uh one of the mods in the forum. Thank you very much
[1583.40 --> 1587.88]  I'm not going to say your name because it's like actually your full name on here, and I don't know if that's okay or not
[1588.68 --> 1590.68]  has said that
[1590.68 --> 1595.64]  Depending on how your snapshots are set up it may be useless against something like this worm
[1596.52 --> 1601.64]  Because it is designed to delete windows file history backups shadow volume copies, etc
[1602.76 --> 1606.60]  So it's it's a little little aggressive if you want to be like
[1607.56 --> 1612.04]  Super duper sure one of the things that you could do is back up onto a device
[1612.04 --> 1615.96]  Like an external hard drive or something and then just unplug it yep
[1616.76 --> 1621.32]  The easiest way to defend against something that is spreading over a network is to not be on the network
[1622.68 --> 1623.16]  There you go
[1624.36 --> 1628.68]  So apparently if we want to keep on diving into this I can go through like the point to point of how it works
[1628.68 --> 1630.68]  Yeah, I would actually love to hear about that
[1631.08 --> 1632.36]  This is actually in our notes
[1632.36 --> 1640.44]  But the the installer creates an encrypted zip with all of the malware files the malware files are extracted with ransom notes in all popular languages
[1640.44 --> 1642.28]  One of cryptor
[1642.28 --> 1648.44]  Will then download a tor client tor is used to communicate with ransomware servers at dot onion addresses
[1648.84 --> 1652.20]  It gives everyone permissions to all files and folders
[1652.68 --> 1659.16]  All database and mail server processes are stopped as data used by these will be encrypted to all files are encrypted
[1659.16 --> 1663.88]  When encrypted the dot wn cry extension is added
[1664.76 --> 1675.00]  It stores the following in every folder that is at please read me at dot txt ransom note at wanna cryptor at dot exe decryptor
[1675.80 --> 1681.24]  It requests admin privileges from the user with uac prompt to do the following
[1681.24 --> 1687.80]  Clear the shadow volume copies disable windows startup recovery and clear windows server backup history
[1688.20 --> 1695.08]  The computer background is changed and wanted decryptor 2.0 launches with the ransom note in your local language
[1695.56 --> 1697.56]  Well, that's convenient actually rather sophisticated
[1699.24 --> 1701.00]  Wow, it's a little aggressive
[1701.56 --> 1710.44]  So like if you like store your super important might get audited tax information or something on like a nas that's like USB plugged into your computer
[1710.44 --> 1712.44]  So
[1713.80 --> 1715.72]  So maybe unplug it or something
[1717.40 --> 1719.80]  An encrypted file container
[1721.00 --> 1721.64]  Could sit
[1723.08 --> 1725.00]  There and you might think that that's safe
[1725.24 --> 1731.40]  But this could actually take your encrypted file container and encrypt that and encrypt that yeah, because you have layers of encryption
[1731.40 --> 1733.80]  Just you started mentioning things like tax returns
[1733.80 --> 1738.92]  And I know like I'm I was I was actually like I'm just I'm thinking about it from an linus media group perspective
[1738.92 --> 1740.92]  And I was like, okay, hold on a second
[1740.92 --> 1745.48]  Where's that container that contains all of linus media groups that stuff?
[1746.52 --> 1749.80]  Right? Yeah, that's not that's not safe unless it's on
[1750.52 --> 1753.24]  Um, so so the way that I set it up is okay though, right?
[1753.24 --> 1754.20]  I think so
[1754.20 --> 1754.60]  Yeah, okay
[1754.60 --> 1757.24]  We can go over it after more yeah, I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure
[1757.88 --> 1758.60]  Um
[1758.60 --> 1762.68]  Yeah stuff has changed since I've been like integral to the server stuff, right?
[1762.68 --> 1765.00]  So I don't know 100% know but we can go over it
[1765.00 --> 1770.92]  All right, Nvidia this was posted by Doc swag on the forum the original article here we have is from
[1771.80 --> 1773.80]  PCworld.com
[1773.96 --> 1775.96]  Nvidia announces
[1775.96 --> 1777.96]  This is a Volta
[1777.96 --> 1781.40]  GPU I did not see this one coming
[1781.40 --> 1783.96]  I didn't think Volta was coming for a bit actually
[1784.52 --> 1790.28]  So for those of you who aren't aware this is the update to Nvidia's Pascal architecture
[1790.28 --> 1792.52]  A lot of people are saying like oh this is already patched in March
[1792.68 --> 1798.36]  A lot of people running servers don't automatically download every patch that comes out
[1798.36 --> 1800.76]  And have their updates disabled
[1801.72 --> 1803.16]  Which is why it's sort of a big deal
[1803.16 --> 1808.76]  That's like a super big deal and that's why people are very widely talking about companies that are getting affected
[1808.76 --> 1813.72]  Because a lot of companies might be running servers that don't have windows update enabled or they might have
[1814.60 --> 1818.44]  They might have a domain controller that has a policy that you know tells
[1818.92 --> 1825.32]  The entire fleet of deployed laptops not to install updates except when they decide to roll them out
[1825.32 --> 1831.88]  Like there's a lot of there's a lot more to the world than just like the way that an individual uses a computer
[1831.88 --> 1836.76]  Every single person having windows update on automatic is not a reality that we exist
[1836.76 --> 1838.44]  I mean, that's what we do, but
[1839.08 --> 1839.80]  Not no
[1840.36 --> 1841.40]  servers
[1841.40 --> 1842.60]  Oh servers no
[1842.60 --> 1843.56]  But I like
[1844.12 --> 1844.68]  Okay, yeah
[1844.68 --> 1846.68]  I'm also a big stupid nerd though
[1846.68 --> 1847.96]  And I'm like
[1847.96 --> 1852.36]  Often in the server room at the end of the day and when no one else is here
[1852.36 --> 1856.52]  I'll be like oh good no one else is here and I'll like install updates and reboot the server so
[1857.08 --> 1860.60]  Ours are probably actually fine. I've done them pretty recently
[1860.60 --> 1861.80]  Yeah
[1861.80 --> 1865.88]  But like there is a lot of people that might not have that update is what i'm trying to get across
[1865.88 --> 1866.92]  I just you know
[1866.92 --> 1870.52]  I do kind of wish that microsoft would make it clear
[1871.40 --> 1873.16]  When it's actually that important
[1875.56 --> 1879.16]  Instead of like trying to force you to update to windows 10 with that said you know what
[1879.96 --> 1882.04]  our active directory domain server
[1882.76 --> 1883.80]  did
[1883.80 --> 1885.88]  A completely restart on its own
[1885.88 --> 1889.08]  And that was about three weeks ago, I think
[1889.88 --> 1892.28]  So i'm actually kind of wondering three four weeks ago
[1892.84 --> 1896.52]  I'm wondering if that was an update getting rolled out and if that was like
[1897.00 --> 1900.76]  If that was the like hey you actually really need to do this stage
[1900.76 --> 1906.84]  And it just did it because I tried to log into it and it was uh it was hung on the like
[1908.20 --> 1911.40]  Windows is restarting please don't turn off your computer i'm sitting here going
[1912.12 --> 1914.12]  Really?
[1914.12 --> 1916.12]  Really?
[1916.12 --> 1923.16]  All right back to volta so this is nvidia's update to the pascal architecture
[1923.24 --> 1930.52]  But if you are wondering what relevance this has to your gaming experience in the immediate future the answer is
[1931.80 --> 1933.56]  Very little if none at all
[1934.28 --> 1936.92]  This thing is an absolute monster
[1937.00 --> 1939.72]  This could be if not the biggest
[1939.72 --> 1941.72]  It is one of the biggest
[1942.20 --> 1944.20]  pieces of silicon
[1944.36 --> 1945.40]  ever
[1945.40 --> 1946.36]  made
[1946.36 --> 1947.32]  It has a
[1947.32 --> 1949.00]  ridiculous
[1949.00 --> 1950.04]  Now look at that
[1950.04 --> 1951.88]  This article even called it ridiculous
[1952.60 --> 1954.60]  ridiculous
[1954.60 --> 1955.72]  815
[1955.72 --> 1957.32]  Millimeter square die
[1958.20 --> 1960.20]  To put that in perspective
[1960.60 --> 1966.92]  The biggest gpus we've ever seen and we actually just finished an nvidia gpus through the ages bit
[1967.64 --> 1974.04]  The biggest ones we've ever seen things like r9 290x from amd so r600
[1975.08 --> 1981.16]  I'm trying to remember which ones from nvidia that have crept up near that 600 millimeter squared size
[1981.56 --> 1983.96]  actually the outgoing p100
[1985.56 --> 1988.20]  Was around 600 plus millimeters squared
[1989.56 --> 1990.68]  This is
[1991.56 --> 1993.72]  like 30 bigger
[1993.72 --> 1999.16]  Then it's it's like it's like it's like building it's like the canyon arrow
[2000.20 --> 2000.76]  of
[2000.76 --> 2001.48]  gpus
[2002.04 --> 2003.00]  and I
[2003.00 --> 2007.08]  I guess that reference is a little bit dated now, but it's it's like
[2007.56 --> 2010.52]  30% bigger than any other plane that flew that day
[2011.08 --> 2011.56]  um
[2012.44 --> 2015.08]  Unbelievable it's using hbm2 memory
[2015.72 --> 2017.72]  and it has over
[2019.40 --> 2019.88]  5 000
[2019.88 --> 2024.04]  CUDA cores with 21 billion transistors
[2025.64 --> 2027.64]  This thing is unreal
[2028.44 --> 2030.20]  So this will be uh this will be
[2031.00 --> 2033.72]  the gpu that's the heart of the tesla
[2033.72 --> 2034.60]  v100
[2035.16 --> 2036.92]  Which is like man?
[2037.48 --> 2038.52]  I was so bummed
[2039.24 --> 2039.56]  um
[2039.56 --> 2041.40]  Because I went earlier this week
[2041.64 --> 2043.00]  I went down to
[2043.00 --> 2044.68]  Simon Fraser university
[2044.68 --> 2047.88]  To do an unboxing of their new super computer
[2047.88 --> 2054.36]  It hasn't been formally benchmarked yet actually like they're still very much installing it the the storage servers haven't been spun up yet
[2054.36 --> 2056.52]  Like it's whoa, okay. It's in progress
[2057.00 --> 2060.04]  um, so I went down to to get hands-on with it
[2060.76 --> 2065.00]  And pretty much as I was sliding out a shelf
[2065.00 --> 2068.84]  Of p100s and I was like nerding out over it
[2069.08 --> 2072.76]  I got a notification on my phone that nvidia dropped the v100
[2073.16 --> 2073.72]  I was like
[2074.84 --> 2077.56]  This is how it feels to be a computer enthusiast
[2079.80 --> 2080.68]  That's pretty brutal
[2080.68 --> 2083.88]  I literally just touched this for the first time and it's obsolete
[2085.96 --> 2086.36]  um
[2086.36 --> 2087.48]  Um
[2087.48 --> 2088.36]  So
[2088.36 --> 2091.32]  Not only is this a huge die
[2092.04 --> 2096.76]  But it's actually using a new process technology as well
[2097.24 --> 2102.28]  So instead of being 16 nanometer this one is 14 nanometer
[2103.00 --> 2107.80]  As I recall 12 nanometer it is 12 nanometer
[2108.52 --> 2109.56]  What the balls
[2110.28 --> 2115.64]  And I think uh pascal is yeah pascal is 14 nanometer sorry so I had I was off by two there
[2116.76 --> 2122.68]  Freaking crazy apparently the r&d budget was over three billion dollars
[2123.16 --> 2129.40]  So if you had some hope that vega was gonna show up and take the wind out of nvidia's sales
[2130.12 --> 2130.76]  um
[2130.76 --> 2134.04]  Well, okay, I don't know how many people are gonna be buying v100
[2134.92 --> 2143.00]  No, but this like in terms of consumers a three billion dollar r&d budget goes into the architecture
[2143.00 --> 2143.88]  Yeah, that's true
[2143.88 --> 2147.16]  That gets you the architecture that nvidia has demonstrated
[2147.16 --> 2153.88]  They've been very good at scaling up and scaling down for more and less performance and power consumption
[2154.52 --> 2154.92]  um
[2155.56 --> 2155.72]  so
[2157.56 --> 2160.20]  AMD already had no answer
[2161.48 --> 2161.88]  to
[2162.76 --> 2163.24]  Pascal
[2163.80 --> 2164.04]  yeah
[2166.52 --> 2167.16]  Poor amd
[2167.16 --> 2173.56]  And if you imagine for a moment that amd had three billion dollars to blow on vega
[2174.20 --> 2175.56]  You've got another thing coming
[2176.44 --> 2177.56]  I did yeah
[2177.56 --> 2178.76]  I'm holding out hope
[2178.76 --> 2181.72]  I believe they have negative three billion dollars to blow on vega
[2181.72 --> 2184.20]  I I hope that amd can
[2185.08 --> 2187.88]  Do something you know crazy here
[2188.52 --> 2192.20]  And uh, and just kind of blindside everybody
[2192.20 --> 2196.12]  But this is this is a real shot across the bow
[2196.68 --> 2201.40]  Not even giving amd a chance to show off vega's performance before they're like yep
[2201.80 --> 2204.68]  We have like working hardware here. It is. We're ready to rock
[2206.20 --> 2207.56]  Holy crap
[2209.80 --> 2210.44]  All right, then
[2211.32 --> 2211.80]  um
[2211.80 --> 2213.80]  Sponsors
[2213.80 --> 2214.44]  Sure
[2214.44 --> 2216.92]  Yeah, we got some sponsors for the show today
[2217.72 --> 2220.44]  This episode is brought to you by squarespace
[2222.12 --> 2229.48]  Squarespace is the way to build your own beautiful website whether it's uh, you know all about nuts
[2230.20 --> 2237.40]  And you just want to tell everybody everything you know whether you're running the uh, you know the local peewee soccer team football football
[2237.40 --> 2241.96]  Sorry, so if I say football then anyone people can interpret that word to me whatever they want
[2242.04 --> 2242.84]  Okay
[2242.84 --> 2248.84]  Local football team and you just want people to be able to find out your your game schedule and how to you know
[2248.84 --> 2250.84]  How to join the team or or whatever it is
[2250.84 --> 2255.40]  You want to build a website and you want it to look pro even if you don't know jack squat all
[2255.96 --> 2259.48]  About building a website squarespace is the way to do it with
[2259.96 --> 2265.56]  Seriously in like a few hours you can go from zero to picking out a template
[2265.56 --> 2273.00]  Even like writing from scratch all the copy you want for your page putting in all of your images and having it makes it much more
[2273.32 --> 2278.60]  Like making a really cool document instead of like needing to know how to code and all this kind of exactly
[2278.76 --> 2284.84]  Yeah, so you can go in just a few hours from only knowing like photos and text to having a working website
[2284.84 --> 2286.76]  That's rock solid
[2286.76 --> 2292.20]  Stable and looks great on any device because all of their templates use responsive design
[2292.20 --> 2296.12]  Um, I mean what else can I really say about it?
[2296.12 --> 2297.64]  I like that they have commerce modules
[2297.64 --> 2300.12]  Yeah, like if you do want to sell stuff through your site
[2300.68 --> 2304.04]  Maybe maybe maybe you know how to code and you can make your own website
[2304.04 --> 2310.52]  But you don't really want to manage this other website that like maybe your mom is making small trinkets and doesn't want to use etsy or whatever
[2310.52 --> 2312.52]  And wants to have her own little store
[2312.76 --> 2315.88]  You could set her up with Squarespace so that you don't have to manage it
[2315.88 --> 2318.04]  You know it'll always work with all the browsers all the time
[2318.04 --> 2322.52]  Could you hypothetically do that? Yes, yes, this is this maybe happened
[2323.00 --> 2329.08]  Um, so head over to squarespace.com slash when and use offer code when to save 10%
[2329.08 --> 2331.64]  You know what actually speaking of which uh, my brother
[2332.44 --> 2336.36]  Uh breeds aquatic lizards and stuff actually I didn't I don't know
[2336.92 --> 2338.52]  I don't know if I've ever talked about that
[2339.56 --> 2347.24]  That's that's been like a passion for him and I I actually my my contribution to his entrepreneurial spirit
[2347.24 --> 2352.92]  And I actually this is I have officially actually paid for squarespace now
[2352.92 --> 2355.96]  Oh, I bought him a year of squarespace. There you go
[2355.96 --> 2357.48]  Um, it was that's
[2358.36 --> 2362.68]  A good like here push start your business. Yep. I was just like like it
[2362.68 --> 2365.72]  I mean to be clear. It's not free like it does cost money
[2366.28 --> 2372.60]  But compared to the time that's involved in trying to set up something scratch built or even something that's a kit
[2372.60 --> 2377.72]  But more complicated it's been totally hands off even though my brother's not super techie
[2377.72 --> 2380.36]  I was just like here here's your login account
[2380.92 --> 2385.00]  Drag and drop move things around and he's stoked on it. That's great
[2385.56 --> 2392.04]  Just helping improve discoverability for your business. I can't believe I've never told that anecdote before that was like christmas time. Yeah
[2393.16 --> 2400.12]  Weird that's cool. Anyway, speaking of your small business if you're looking for an accounting. So why haven't I hooked them up with fresh books yet?
[2400.12 --> 2402.12]  Wow, I suck
[2406.28 --> 2412.36]  You did you went 50% of the way okay, does he have a birthday coming out? That's christmas, right? You know what august there you go
[2412.60 --> 2415.48]  Yeah, why don't I just hook my brother up with fresh books for his birthday?
[2415.96 --> 2423.40]  Okay, so fresh books is the super simple way to handle the back end of managing your business. So logging hours
[2423.40 --> 2432.44]  Um tracking expenses sending out invoices to people you can send professional looking invoices in less than 30 seconds
[2432.44 --> 2436.04]  I think that's the 30 second one or less than a day. Whatever. It's it's really fast
[2436.68 --> 2437.72]  um
[2437.96 --> 2443.08]  Their app has a feature that lets you see when your clients look at the invoice for the first time
[2443.08 --> 2448.84]  One of my favorite things and would probably be helpful for your brother is that if you get receipts or something because you buy like say
[2448.84 --> 2449.24]  Yeah
[2449.24 --> 2451.24]  Aquatic lizard food
[2451.24 --> 2457.00]  Um you can take a picture of it with your phone and it will automatically take care of all your expenses
[2457.00 --> 2461.08]  Yeah, it's it's actually it's pretty it's pretty lit for a lizard tanks
[2461.24 --> 2466.04]  Um the mobile app has all the functionality of the desktop version so you can take it with you on the go
[2466.04 --> 2471.40]  And if you have any questions, you can reach out to their support staff where you will speak to a real human immediately
[2471.88 --> 2476.68]  No phone tree no escalations no return call. It's really funny because this tagline sounds so bad
[2477.24 --> 2481.32]  There is no phone tree no escalations no return calls
[2481.88 --> 2485.32]  And then they're like just answers. Oh, oh, so it's good. It's in a good way
[2486.84 --> 2493.48]  So head to freshbooks.com slash when and try it out for free today enter when in the how did you hear about us section?
[2493.48 --> 2498.44]  When you sign up for your free trial and oh, I've even forgot to mention they've got a mobile card reader as well
[2498.44 --> 2502.20]  So you can even accept payments directly through the platform
[2502.92 --> 2507.32]  Um, I have one more ad technically, but this is more of like us just talking about our thing
[2508.04 --> 2514.20]  Wow, that banner looks terrible. Yeah, it really does. That is the worst looking banner
[2515.08 --> 2517.08]  That we have ever made
[2517.80 --> 2519.80]  It's not gonna it looks awful
[2520.52 --> 2522.52]  What happened to it?
[2522.52 --> 2527.72]  I mean, I think they just took the logo and just put it on the gray background and then never looked at it
[2527.72 --> 2531.24]  And we're just like cool. It's done. I bet Pella's to blame for this
[2532.36 --> 2536.44]  Because he he did a lot of the work on the logo way to go way to go Pella
[2538.76 --> 2543.80]  Anyways, anyways, we're having a tech carnival. Yeah, which is like a weird mixture between
[2544.68 --> 2549.64]  Con and carnival some of the ideas with that is like it's gonna be tech based and we're all gonna be there
[2549.64 --> 2553.96]  And there'll be cool fun activities, but there will also be like a nerf shooting range
[2554.28 --> 2557.08]  Maybe maybe so the activities are very much up in the air
[2557.08 --> 2560.36]  I don't know if you're CC'd on the emails, but depending on how many people sign up
[2561.32 --> 2563.32]  What the event actually is might change?
[2563.32 --> 2567.24]  Oh, but the whole team will be there and it'll be it'll be cool and it'll be fun
[2567.24 --> 2571.40]  Okay, and there'll be stuff to do and you basically hang out with us for a day
[2571.40 --> 2571.96]  Yeah
[2571.96 --> 2578.68]  Um, and if that sounds appealing to you then great head over to ticket rocket dot co slash event slash details
[2578.68 --> 2580.52]  Holy crap. This is a horrible url
[2580.52 --> 2581.64]  Why don't we shorten that?
[2581.64 --> 2583.64]  I'm gonna go ahead and drop that in the thing here
[2583.96 --> 2586.44]  And if it sounds horrible then don't come
[2587.32 --> 2593.96]  A few people from my stream have bought tickets from your stream people from your stream. There's are they born yet?
[2599.00 --> 2601.00]  It's not really a stream so much as a
[2601.00 --> 2613.96]  And in fairness, I didn't tell them don't come
[2620.04 --> 2621.64]  I'm done now. Oh my god
[2621.64 --> 2623.64]  I'm always done
[2625.00 --> 2627.00]  No, well with me
[2628.20 --> 2630.20]  Anyways, wow
[2630.20 --> 2634.60]  Yeah, so that'll be cool because I haven't actually met a ton of them at different like conventions and stuff
[2634.60 --> 2639.16]  But that might have been the worst bit I ever did that was pretty that was that was pretty heavy. Yeah
[2641.24 --> 2645.88]  All right topics, let's get into let's get back to the wet. Let's get back into it. Yeah
[2647.56 --> 2649.56]  Okay, so some other big news
[2650.60 --> 2656.36]  AMD is pushing another microcode update to improve ryzen so the original article here is from tweakedown
[2656.36 --> 2658.36]  Let's go ahead and pop that up here
[2658.36 --> 2662.68]  Basically improved ddr4 support which is good because they don't support ddr3 at all
[2662.68 --> 2665.64]  So if they can't improve the ddr4 support then we're in a lot of trouble
[2666.12 --> 2671.80]  Um the info was leaked by a gigabyte reps forum post indicating amd is pushing out the microcode update
[2671.80 --> 2675.08]  It will add over 20 new registers for the summit ridge
[2675.64 --> 2681.96]  uh integrated memory controllers to improve compatibility with intel optimized ddr4 memory brands
[2681.96 --> 2686.28]  Um it'll be deployed through motherboard vendors as motherboard bios
[2686.28 --> 2687.00]  updates
[2687.00 --> 2694.28]  This is crazy. This was posted by random hk kid on the forum and the original article is from the bbc
[2694.84 --> 2698.28]  uk police to start using minority report-esque
[2698.28 --> 2702.04]  means to help with custody
[2702.76 --> 2703.40]  decisions
[2703.40 --> 2713.56]  What what it has been tested for three years and is now being readied for a live
[2714.44 --> 2720.36]  pilot apparently it's 98% I can't even fight on here, but I remember um, it's 98%
[2720.92 --> 2724.04]  accurate with uh, low risk offenders
[2724.68 --> 2727.16]  Yeah, with low with a suspect of low risk
[2727.16 --> 2733.72]  It was accurate 98% of the time and forecasts for high risk suspects were accurate 88% of the time
[2733.72 --> 2737.32]  So basically it's designed to classify individuals
[2737.96 --> 2741.96]  Based on a low medium or high risk of them committing a future
[2742.52 --> 2747.56]  Offense and then to decide whether they should be kept in custody
[2748.12 --> 2753.32]  The system was made uh so using data so the the tool is called the harm
[2753.32 --> 2762.04]  Assessment risk tool or heart and the data was taken from durham police records between 2008 and 2012
[2762.60 --> 2768.12]  It was then tested in 2013 and the results were monitored over the following two years
[2768.76 --> 2775.56]  So forecasts wow so that so basically those numbers are based on real forecasts that they made
[2776.36 --> 2779.88]  Over the last half a decade or so almost actually almost a decade
[2779.88 --> 2784.76]  Isn't that incredible? I'd like to know what they were using for forecasting this data
[2785.48 --> 2790.12]  Well, they're using whether they caught them doing something again. No like um
[2790.92 --> 2795.56]  Because they're guessing if they're going to be doing something or not. Yes. So how are they guessing that?
[2796.12 --> 2797.72]  Uh, let's have a look
[2799.16 --> 2802.20]  Wow, okay, yeah, I don't think it's wow here we go
[2802.20 --> 2811.48]  So the system includes data beyond but also including a suspect's offending history including their postal code and gender
[2812.20 --> 2819.80]  To some extent what learning models do is bring out into the foreground hidden and tacit assumptions that have been made all along
[2820.28 --> 2827.24]  By human beings so pretty much they're using machine learning to stereotype accurately
[2827.48 --> 2829.48]  Yeah
[2829.48 --> 2833.16]  That's gonna be like
[2833.80 --> 2838.04]  I think the giant conversation in like four or five years is gonna be that
[2838.44 --> 2841.96]  Yeah, it's like how much is this becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy?
[2842.20 --> 2844.92]  Yeah, it's like and I don't I'm not I'm not going to
[2846.20 --> 2848.84]  I don't want this to become like one of those things
[2849.32 --> 2852.12]  Where I where I I fell into the trap where I said
[2852.44 --> 2856.84]  I'm not gonna say that someone whose name starts with H was anything very poorly
[2856.84 --> 2859.56]  See, I'm not gonna I'm not gonna do that again
[2859.56 --> 2860.12]  He doesn't think that way
[2860.12 --> 2863.32]  Yeah, but like what I do what I really don't like
[2863.32 --> 2864.36]  I could start saying like, you know
[2865.32 --> 2869.24]  Skin colors and genders and you know backgrounds and jobs
[2870.52 --> 2874.20]  Basically, we're gonna be making these arguments five years from now
[2874.20 --> 2879.88]  That this system is creating this self-fulfilling prophecy of suspicion
[2880.44 --> 2886.60]  That that goes beyond sort of the your racist grandpa or whatever
[2886.60 --> 2889.48]  Where you like the computer thinks I can't do this, right?
[2889.48 --> 2891.32]  Yes, which is just the system
[2892.20 --> 2894.20]  objectively empirically
[2894.20 --> 2901.08]  Has decided that I am a high-risk individual to be a criminal
[2901.08 --> 2903.64]  And then like does this start becoming public data?
[2903.64 --> 2905.48]  Can that be seen on employment records?
[2905.48 --> 2909.32]  Like if you're gonna hire someone can you see their risk profile?
[2909.32 --> 2912.44]  That would stop anyone from having the chance of being able to rise above
[2912.44 --> 2913.16]  Yes
[2913.16 --> 2914.76]  Which is like really brutal
[2914.76 --> 2915.96]  That's terrifying
[2915.96 --> 2917.64]  I'm super not cool with that
[2917.64 --> 2921.00]  Um now to be clear not all the decisions that it is
[2921.96 --> 2925.08]  Helping or that is helping with seem like that big of a deal
[2925.56 --> 2929.96]  Like one of the things is to decide whether to keep a suspect in custody for a few more hours
[2930.60 --> 2938.12]  Whether to release them on bail before a charge or after a charge has been made whether to reprimand them in custody
[2938.76 --> 2942.28]  Now that one doesn't sound very good, but the bit about the previous two more hours
[2943.00 --> 2943.72]  It's probably fine
[2943.72 --> 2950.28]  Oh, it seems like saving a little bit of someone's time instead of like so the forecasting model's output is
[2951.08 --> 2952.36]  advisory
[2952.36 --> 2953.08]  Yeah
[2953.08 --> 2956.84]  And should not remove discretion from the police officer using a bit
[2956.84 --> 2957.32]  Come on
[2957.32 --> 2960.36]  Except if the police officer's job becomes easier because of this
[2960.36 --> 2960.76]  Yeah, and if
[2960.76 --> 2961.48]  They're definitely gonna use it
[2961.48 --> 2963.96]  And and it becomes an ass covering measure
[2963.96 --> 2964.52]  Yeah
[2964.52 --> 2965.72]  Where oh well it told me
[2965.72 --> 2967.08]  Yeah, if I'm a cop
[2968.28 --> 2968.76]  I'm
[2968.76 --> 2972.52]  You know if I know that even 88% of the time
[2972.52 --> 2975.64]  I'm gonna get it right if I just do what the computer tells me
[2975.64 --> 2978.20]  And like it might it might come to the point where like yeah, it's advisory
[2978.20 --> 2979.80]  But if you go against the advisory
[2980.04 --> 2981.96]  Well you went against the advice
[2981.96 --> 2984.76]  That will raise a flag and you now have to go talk to your boss
[2984.76 --> 2985.24]  That's right
[2985.24 --> 2985.72]  And explain why
[2985.72 --> 2991.16]  You went against the best advice that you could you created extra paperwork and headache for yourself
[2991.40 --> 2996.44]  Your boss is gonna be pissed off because why do I have to have this stupid meeting you could you should have just gone with the computer or whatever
[2997.40 --> 2997.88]  Wow
[2997.88 --> 2999.56]  That's terrifying
[2999.56 --> 3000.20]  Um
[3000.20 --> 3002.20]  Oh cool
[3002.20 --> 3004.20]  Microsoft confirms
[3004.20 --> 3013.32]  Keyboard for Xbox one for sure and also some mice and in the future they plan on having all mice working
[3013.32 --> 3018.68]  Um now it's gonna have to be supported by developers so rip everyone
[3018.68 --> 3022.44]  But as we already know there's a lot of like emulation stuff that can happen
[3022.44 --> 3026.44]  Now console gamers can put up with crappy console port UI nonsense
[3026.44 --> 3028.44]  Yeah
[3028.44 --> 3034.44]  That's great like the grand theft auto options for changing your graphical settings that are just broken AF for no reason
[3034.44 --> 3035.56]  So stupid
[3035.56 --> 3036.44]  Or like
[3036.44 --> 3040.44]  Hey I loaded it again with a minor hardware change time for those to be all reset
[3040.44 --> 3042.44]  Or like press a to continue and you're like
[3042.44 --> 3044.44]  Ha ha ha ha
[3044.44 --> 3046.44]  What doesn't it work?
[3046.44 --> 3050.44]  Oh enter oh you mean enter or sometimes spacebar
[3050.44 --> 3052.44]  Yeah, yeah as it were
[3052.44 --> 3054.44]  Uh that's still pretty cool
[3054.44 --> 3062.44]  I love that they are finally getting this like convergence thing going why did why did we treat the Xbox one like not a computer for so long?
[3062.44 --> 3064.44]  It like absolutely is a computer
[3064.44 --> 3066.44]  It makes it's so frustrating
[3066.44 --> 3070.44]  So it says initially most models of mice won't be compatible
[3070.44 --> 3074.44]  However a handful of mice will be and Microsoft hopes to add support for all mice over time
[3074.44 --> 3080.44]  But even then developers will have to code support for this new control system into their games
[3080.44 --> 3085.44]  That could be easy for games that are already developed for Windows with UWP porting in mind
[3085.44 --> 3093.44]  But it might be a bigger lift for more control centric to love developers certain games that are multiplayer
[3093.44 --> 3095.44]  I'm so stoked on that
[3095.44 --> 3099.44]  Yeah, that's gonna be really interesting because for a while we've had like these weird
[3099.44 --> 3104.44]  We had one in office for a little while then it was just so janky and broken that we decided not to do a video on it
[3104.44 --> 3109.44]  Yeah, but it was like so butthurt over that they were emailing me for like six months after
[3109.44 --> 3111.44]  We'll make a better product when is the review going up?
[3111.44 --> 3112.44]  When is the review going up?
[3112.44 --> 3115.44]  Remember me following up with you be like hey when's that review going up?
[3115.44 --> 3118.44]  And you're just like eventually you're just like never
[3118.44 --> 3128.44]  I don't remember what company it was from but we had this little box where you could plug a keyboard and mouse into an Xbox and it was just
[3128.44 --> 3135.44]  It was just kind of garbage so we never made a video on it but now that it has like official support it could be really good
[3135.44 --> 3136.44]  Yeah
[3136.44 --> 3138.44]  Yeah
[3138.44 --> 3146.44]  Nvidia's new headquarters will be liquid cooled with a triple fan solution the original article here is game debate dot com and
[3147.44 --> 3154.44]  It actually looks yeah, I think it looks kind of dumb, but it's a big triangle made up of like tessellated triangles
[3154.44 --> 3160.44]  And it's gonna have two floors and capacity for up to twenty five hundred employees
[3160.44 --> 3169.44]  There will be a large central courtyard which every department feeds into and this is an effort to quote unquote capture the energy and buzz of the company
[3169.44 --> 3172.44]  Hooray
[3172.44 --> 3173.44]  Hooray
[3173.44 --> 3176.44]  Okay
[3176.44 --> 3177.44]  Um
[3177.44 --> 3179.44]  So that's neat
[3179.44 --> 3181.44]  Jensen does not have an office here
[3181.44 --> 3184.44]  It's another weird random bit of information
[3184.44 --> 3185.44]  Um
[3185.44 --> 3188.44]  He does not have an office in the big new headquarters
[3188.44 --> 3189.44]  Really?
[3189.44 --> 3190.44]  Yep
[3190.44 --> 3193.44]  So he's just gonna like walk around and check on people?
[3193.44 --> 3194.44]  I
[3194.44 --> 3196.44]  Or like be somewhere else. I don't know
[3196.44 --> 3197.44]  Interesting
[3197.44 --> 3199.44]  But yeah, apparently there's no office there
[3199.44 --> 3207.44]  Under the floor there's a giant garage and the building has a snaking system of pipes that feed into a hidden water tower sunk into the roof of the building
[3207.44 --> 3214.44]  Um, the recycled water is then filtered through an evaporation system utilizing three giant fans to keep the building cool
[3214.44 --> 3217.44]  So that's that is that is pretty cool. Uh, actually
[3217.44 --> 3222.44]  Uh, actually, um, SFU's supercomputer is using evaporative cooling as well
[3222.44 --> 3226.44]  Oh, cool. Yeah, and it the way that they did it is really neat
[3226.44 --> 3227.44]  So
[3227.44 --> 3228.44]  I want to know now
[3228.44 --> 3230.44]  You would imagine
[3230.44 --> 3232.44]  Evaporative cooling
[3232.44 --> 3236.44]  So on the most basic level evaporative cooling would be you've got cooling tubes
[3236.44 --> 3244.44]  You expose the water to airflow so that it some some of the water molecules evaporate and you effectively cool
[3244.44 --> 3248.44]  down the remaining droplets to sub ambient temperatures and then that gets circulated
[3248.44 --> 3251.44]  But the problem with an open system is that you
[3251.44 --> 3252.44]  Contaminants
[3252.44 --> 3253.44]  You get contaminants in it
[3253.44 --> 3254.44]  So
[3254.44 --> 3263.44]  Um, oh, right, and the other thing you would probably assume is that the water being pumped around the data center goes to the heat generating components
[3263.44 --> 3270.44]  Like say for example CPUs and GPUs and then there's a hot side that carries that water back out to be cooled
[3270.44 --> 3273.44]  So two things that are going to blow your mind
[3273.44 --> 3276.44]  There's the water cooling system for the building
[3276.44 --> 3280.44]  But there are no blocks installed on anything
[3280.44 --> 3283.44]  And they're using evaporative cooling
[3283.44 --> 3288.44]  But the actual coolant being recirculated is not exposed to the elements
[3288.44 --> 3290.44]  How does that work?
[3290.44 --> 3294.44]  So the radiators outside the building
[3294.44 --> 3300.44]  There's an automated system that when the coolant temperature goes above a certain threshold
[3300.44 --> 3302.44]  They basically have a big fire hose
[3302.44 --> 3303.44]  Wow
[3303.44 --> 3304.44]  That sprays them down
[3304.44 --> 3307.44]  And I was like that is so cool
[3307.44 --> 3316.44]  So they can maintain their 17 degree coolant target in up to 30 degree weather
[3316.44 --> 3317.44]  Wow
[3317.44 --> 3318.44]  Yes
[3318.44 --> 3319.44]  What?
[3319.44 --> 3322.44]  And then they have uh, they have an extra chiller that can kick in
[3322.44 --> 3323.44]  Okay
[3323.44 --> 3324.44]  If we get like up really high
[3324.44 --> 3327.44]  And, and you know boost the
[3327.44 --> 3329.44]  Now, now back to the servers
[3329.44 --> 3330.44]  They're all air cooled
[3330.44 --> 3332.44]  How are they doing sub ambient?
[3332.44 --> 3335.44]  Um, with evaporative cooling
[3335.44 --> 3337.44]  So by spraying water on the fins
[3337.44 --> 3339.44]  It, it cools the fins
[3339.44 --> 3340.44]  Wow that's
[3340.44 --> 3341.44]  So much
[3341.44 --> 3342.44]  Ridiculous
[3342.44 --> 3344.44]  So it's not going to be just sometimes
[3344.44 --> 3345.44]  They're going to spray it
[3345.44 --> 3346.44]  Yeah
[3346.44 --> 3347.44]  Fairly often
[3347.44 --> 3348.44]  Yes
[3348.44 --> 3349.44]  Okay
[3349.44 --> 3350.44]  Yeah
[3350.44 --> 3351.44]  And they were saying that in high
[3351.44 --> 3352.44]  I thought you were just saying like in particular load
[3352.44 --> 3353.44]  No
[3353.44 --> 3354.44]  They would spray it
[3354.44 --> 3355.44]  So in high temperature, low humidity
[3355.44 --> 3357.44]  The water evaporates nearly instantly
[3357.44 --> 3358.44]  So they can just keep blasting it
[3358.44 --> 3359.44]  It gets super cold
[3359.44 --> 3360.44]  Wow, that's wild
[3360.44 --> 3361.44]  Really neat
[3361.44 --> 3363.44]  And then in the servers
[3363.44 --> 3364.44]  Get this
[3364.44 --> 3367.44]  They are drawing in air from the room
[3367.44 --> 3368.44]  Okay
[3368.44 --> 3369.44]  Just from the room
[3369.44 --> 3372.44]  They're just air cooled servers
[3372.44 --> 3374.44]  So they've got ducting
[3374.44 --> 3376.44]  So there, it's all taped up and sealed up
[3376.44 --> 3377.44]  Yeah
[3377.44 --> 3378.44]  Every cabinet
[3378.44 --> 3380.44]  So it, so all the air goes in one way
[3380.44 --> 3381.44]  There's no, there's uh
[3381.44 --> 3383.44]  There's no kind of like inefficiency from
[3383.44 --> 3384.44]  Okay
[3384.44 --> 3387.44]  Back pressure forcing air to be recirculated within the cabinet
[3387.44 --> 3388.44]  Yeah
[3388.44 --> 3392.44]  And then what they've got is massive radiators
[3392.44 --> 3395.44]  On the back of every rack
[3395.44 --> 3398.44]  That are so thick and so dense
[3398.44 --> 3399.44]  That when you stand
[3399.44 --> 3401.44]  So if you open up the door and stand behind it
[3401.44 --> 3403.44]  It feels like a server rack
[3403.44 --> 3404.44]  It's like fricking hot
[3404.44 --> 3406.44]  Like 30 degrees celsius
[3406.44 --> 3407.44]  You close the door
[3407.44 --> 3409.44]  And it's like a cool breeze
[3409.44 --> 3410.44]  Oh, that's so weird
[3410.44 --> 3411.44]  It's incredible
[3411.44 --> 3412.44]  It's amazing
[3412.44 --> 3414.44]  And it's super efficient
[3414.44 --> 3415.44]  Cool
[3415.44 --> 3417.44]  So a typical data center
[3417.44 --> 3418.44]  I forget what the scale is called
[3418.44 --> 3419.44]  I'm excited to see this
[3419.44 --> 3420.44]  Cause you're making a video on this, right?
[3420.44 --> 3422.44]  Oh, it's already, yeah, it's
[3422.44 --> 3423.44]  This is in production already
[3423.44 --> 3424.44]  Oh, cool
[3424.44 --> 3425.44]  I filmed it, yeah
[3425.44 --> 3426.44]  Cool
[3426.44 --> 3427.44]  It's lit
[3427.44 --> 3428.44]  It's amazing
[3428.44 --> 3429.44]  Um
[3429.44 --> 3431.44]  So a typical data center
[3431.44 --> 3433.44]  In a perfect, I forget what the scale is
[3433.44 --> 3434.44]  You're saying it's lit now?
[3434.44 --> 3435.44]  Yeah, I know
[3435.44 --> 3436.44]  In a perfect world
[3436.44 --> 3437.44]  I'm older than you
[3437.44 --> 3438.44]  In a perfect world
[3438.44 --> 3440.44]  The scale is one would be like ideal
[3440.44 --> 3441.44]  You can never achieve that
[3441.44 --> 3442.44]  Yeah
[3442.44 --> 3443.44]  For efficiency
[3443.44 --> 3444.44]  Yeah
[3444.44 --> 3445.44]  On whatever the scale is
[3445.44 --> 3446.44]  Yeah
[3446.44 --> 3447.44]  A typical data center is one and a half to two
[3447.44 --> 3449.44]  They're at 1.07
[3449.44 --> 3450.44]  Geez
[3450.44 --> 3452.44]  Their cooling system is so efficient
[3452.44 --> 3454.44]  Because pumping a little bit of water
[3454.44 --> 3455.44]  Especially in raincouver
[3455.44 --> 3456.44]  Yeah, yeah, yeah
[3456.44 --> 3457.44]  No big deal
[3457.44 --> 3458.44]  Not a big deal
[3458.44 --> 3459.44]  Hydro up here, like, doesn't matter
[3459.44 --> 3460.44]  Yeah
[3460.44 --> 3461.44]  Like
[3461.44 --> 3462.44]  Like
[3462.44 --> 3463.44]  I think I get a water bill
[3463.44 --> 3464.44]  But I don't know how much it costs
[3464.44 --> 3465.44]  Cause it's not a big deal
[3465.44 --> 3467.44]  And like, even power
[3467.44 --> 3469.44]  Cause our power is like water based
[3469.44 --> 3470.44]  Yeah
[3470.44 --> 3473.44]  So like, BC is one of the worst places for solar power
[3473.44 --> 3475.44]  I'm like, so interested in solar power
[3475.44 --> 3476.44]  But it's so useless for me
[3476.44 --> 3478.44]  Because power is relatively cheap
[3478.44 --> 3483.44]  And we have an extremely low amount of like natural sunlight
[3483.44 --> 3485.44]  Because we have so many clouds
[3485.44 --> 3490.44]  Um, there's like other places in Canada that are way more effective for solar power than BC is
[3490.44 --> 3493.44]  Okay, did you talk about this before?
[3493.44 --> 3494.44]  No
[3494.44 --> 3495.44]  Okay, cool
[3495.44 --> 3498.44]  This is old news, but I'm mad
[3498.44 --> 3499.44]  So we're gonna talk about it anyway
[3499.44 --> 3501.44]  Intel rebrand
[3501.44 --> 3503.44]  Get it
[3503.44 --> 3504.44]  Intel rebrand
[3504.44 --> 3506.44]  Intel rebrands their Xeon line
[3506.44 --> 3508.44]  Announces new chips based on Skylake
[3508.44 --> 3511.44]  So the original article here is from Extreme Tech
[3511.44 --> 3516.44]  Gone is Xeon E3, E5, etc.
[3516.44 --> 3518.44]  Here is
[3518.44 --> 3523.44]  Platinum, Gold, Silver, and Bronze
[3523.44 --> 3526.44]  Because apparently
[3526.44 --> 3529.44]  Intel's naming scheme, folks
[3529.44 --> 3531.44]  While they
[3531.44 --> 3535.44]  The old system was near indecipherable
[3535.44 --> 3536.44]  At least
[3536.44 --> 3539.44]  It had like some years of continuity
[3539.44 --> 3545.44]  So it was somewhat easy to keep track of what was going on generation by generation
[3545.44 --> 3546.44]  Now
[3546.44 --> 3550.44]  They don't want us to be able to understand what's going on
[3550.44 --> 3551.44]  And
[3551.44 --> 3552.44]  They also
[3552.44 --> 3554.44]  Completely lack creativity
[3554.44 --> 3557.44]  Unbelievable
[3557.44 --> 3559.44]  I don't really have any redeeming stuff for that
[3559.44 --> 3562.44]  I think you found another TechWiki video to make though
[3562.44 --> 3563.44]  Yeah
[3563.44 --> 3568.44]  TechWiki, like half the videos on TechWiki should just be explaining naming schemes
[3568.44 --> 3569.44]  Yeah
[3569.44 --> 3574.44]  And then we should just encourage more companies to have really wonko naming schemes
[3574.44 --> 3577.44]  Because like what I don't like about this is in a lot of situations
[3577.44 --> 3582.44]  Maybe a silver is exactly what you want and having a platinum one might literally be worse
[3582.44 --> 3584.44]  Yeah, because we've definitely run into that
[3584.44 --> 3586.44]  Yeah, so it's not actually like
[3586.44 --> 3590.44]  Oh, it's just factually better if it's in a higher tier and it'll cost more
[3590.44 --> 3591.44]  That's not actually true
[3591.44 --> 3593.44]  This is fantastic
[3593.44 --> 3597.44]  This was originally posted by N Tony on the forum
[3597.44 --> 3600.44]  And uh, open bench table
[3600.44 --> 3604.44]  Seemingly as a direct response
[3604.44 --> 3607.44]  To us dropping our test benches
[3607.44 --> 3610.44]  Now has a 3D printable
[3610.44 --> 3611.44]  Vertical stand
[3611.44 --> 3614.44]  I was wondering why they sent this to me
[3614.44 --> 3616.44]  Because the guy emailed me directly
[3616.44 --> 3618.44]  Being like, hey, by the way
[3618.44 --> 3619.44]  There's now 3D printable stands
[3619.44 --> 3620.44]  And I was like
[3621.44 --> 3622.44]  Okay
[3623.44 --> 3625.44]  And that actually makes a lot of sense now
[3628.44 --> 3629.44]  Oh man
[3629.44 --> 3630.44]  Yeah, we should probably print some of those
[3630.44 --> 3631.44]  Yeah
[3632.44 --> 3633.44]  That might be a good idea
[3634.44 --> 3635.44]  I guess that's pretty much it
[3635.44 --> 3637.44]  Is there anything else you really wanted to hit today?
[3637.44 --> 3638.44]  Uh, the float plane?
[3639.44 --> 3640.44]  Scrapyard Wars?
[3640.44 --> 3641.44]  Oh
[3641.44 --> 3642.44]  Oh yeah
[3643.44 --> 3644.44]  Okay
[3644.44 --> 3646.44]  So, people have been hounding us
[3647.44 --> 3649.44]  When is Scrapyard Wars actually coming?
[3650.44 --> 3655.44]  Because the teaser just said May soonish
[3656.44 --> 3658.44]  Because Ed is a gigantic troll
[3659.44 --> 3663.44]  Scrapyard Wars does have a firm release date
[3664.44 --> 3668.44]  The first episode is coming to Float Plane Club this weekend
[3668.44 --> 3669.44]  Um
[3669.44 --> 3670.44]  Do we have a like
[3671.44 --> 3672.44]  A night specifically?
[3673.44 --> 3674.44]  Uh, it's, I don't
[3674.44 --> 3675.44]  Yes we do, but I don't remember what it is
[3675.44 --> 3676.44]  Sure
[3677.44 --> 3678.44]  Um, oh man
[3678.44 --> 3680.44]  Yvonne was actually like, stoked
[3681.44 --> 3684.44]  She was like, hey, do you wanna watch Scrapyard Wars with me tonight?
[3685.44 --> 3686.44]  And I was like, yeah, that's the trailer
[3687.44 --> 3688.44]  She's like, what? No, wait, what?
[3689.44 --> 3690.44]  Well, when's it coming?
[3690.44 --> 3695.44]  I wanna watch it
[3696.44 --> 3697.44]  Yeah
[3697.44 --> 3698.44]  I wanna watch it before everybody else
[3698.44 --> 3699.44]  Oh
[3699.44 --> 3700.44]  So is Boiler
[3700.44 --> 3701.44]  Boiler was like, when is it being uploaded?
[3702.44 --> 3706.44]  So, it is first episode coming this weekend to Float Plane
[3707.44 --> 3708.44]  Yeah
[3708.44 --> 3710.44]  So the following weekend to YouTube
[3711.44 --> 3713.44]  So there'll be, episodes will be coming one week apart
[3713.44 --> 3718.44]  We've, we've got the production process streamlined enough now that we can, we can commit to that
[3719.44 --> 3724.44]  And then there'll be a one week delay between Float Plane Club and YouTube
[3724.44 --> 3730.44]  So if you guys are wondering how to be the first to get your hands on Scrapyard Wars
[3731.44 --> 3736.44]  Basically what you do is you head over to the store on the Linus Tech Tips forum
[3737.44 --> 3739.44]  There'll be a better system for this in the future, I promise
[3740.44 --> 3741.44]  But you head over to the store
[3743.44 --> 3745.44]  And you buy a subscription to Float Plane Club
[3746.44 --> 3748.44]  Which gives you access, don't worry, I know
[3749.44 --> 3750.44]  Um, I got this
[3751.44 --> 3752.44]  Which gives you access to
[3752.44 --> 3755.44]  Uh, hold on, no, no, it's, it's fine
[3755.44 --> 3756.44]  I think we're good now
[3757.44 --> 3758.44]  Actually, we're good here
[3758.44 --> 3760.44]  You're not even supposed to be using a laptop
[3760.44 --> 3761.44]  I, I promised
[3761.44 --> 3762.44]  I know
[3762.44 --> 3763.44]  The admin team on the forum that you would not
[3763.44 --> 3764.44]  I know, I know, but I'm
[3764.44 --> 3766.44]  They were trying to take your admin account away
[3766.44 --> 3767.44]  Uh, okay, but I'm
[3767.44 --> 3769.44]  And it was like, put to a vote and you lost
[3769.44 --> 3770.44]  Okay
[3770.44 --> 3771.44]  And I like, tried to veto it
[3771.44 --> 3772.44]  Because I said you would use a different laptop
[3772.44 --> 3774.44]  And then you told me that you would get it done
[3774.44 --> 3775.44]  I will
[3775.44 --> 3776.44]  I will, I will
[3776.44 --> 3778.44]  I'm not today, but you can see how aware of it
[3778.44 --> 3780.44]  Okay, approval to share my screen
[3780.44 --> 3782.44]  Sure
[3782.44 --> 3783.44]  Okay
[3783.44 --> 3784.44]  Find us a screen
[3784.44 --> 3785.44]  Don't click on anything
[3785.44 --> 3786.44]  I'm not clicking on anything
[3786.44 --> 3787.44]  I'm not clicking on anything
[3787.44 --> 3788.44]  I'm not clicking on anything
[3788.44 --> 3791.44]  So you will get access to a hidden sub forum
[3791.44 --> 3792.44]  On the forum
[3792.44 --> 3793.44]  There's a button up here to go to it
[3793.44 --> 3794.44]  Float Plane Club
[3794.44 --> 3798.44]  And then you'll see all the stuff that is out on Float Plane
[3798.44 --> 3800.44]  But isn't out yet on YouTube
[3800.44 --> 3803.44]  So we've got the world's smallest video drone
[3803.44 --> 3805.44]  We've got Channel Super Fun
[3805.44 --> 3807.44]  I think on YouTube we're gonna call this video
[3807.44 --> 3809.44]  Uh, this game was banned
[3809.44 --> 3810.44]  Yeah
[3810.44 --> 3811.44]  Cause we have to
[3811.44 --> 3812.44]  Cause it was
[3812.44 --> 3813.44]  Yeah
[3813.44 --> 3815.44]  Um, we have best desktop graphics for your laptop
[3815.44 --> 3818.44]  So we take a proprietary solution versus Thunderbolt 3
[3818.44 --> 3819.44]  Oh cool
[3819.44 --> 3821.44]  And benchmark the snot out of it
[3821.44 --> 3822.44]  That's really interesting
[3822.44 --> 3823.44]  I like that one
[3823.44 --> 3824.44]  It's actually a really good video
[3824.44 --> 3827.44]  Um, we've got, uh, removing thermal compound
[3827.44 --> 3829.44]  The best way we test
[3829.44 --> 3832.44]  I think it's over a dozen different liquids
[3832.44 --> 3833.44]  I drank some of them
[3833.44 --> 3834.44]  Uh, yep
[3834.44 --> 3835.44]  Once we were done
[3835.44 --> 3837.44]  Uh, LTT is bigger worse
[3837.44 --> 3840.44]  The Alienware 15 gaming laptop review
[3840.44 --> 3843.44]  Uh, this one was a simultaneous release
[3843.44 --> 3845.44]  We've got the most bizarre keyboard
[3845.44 --> 3847.44]  That one's gonna be fun
[3847.44 --> 3850.44]  There's also like little bits that you're doing from every now and then
[3850.44 --> 3851.44]  Yeah, I don't do that very often though
[3851.44 --> 3853.44]  That's like the post
[3853.44 --> 3854.44]  Yeah
[3854.44 --> 3857.44]  But, uh, theoretically there's some more sort of discussion in there
[3857.44 --> 3859.44]  Um, yeah
[3859.44 --> 3860.44]  So there you go
[3860.44 --> 3861.44]  This is the one that went up on
[3861.44 --> 3863.44]  That went up on YouTube just now
[3863.44 --> 3864.44]  Yeah
[3864.44 --> 3865.44]  So
[3865.44 --> 3866.44]  In a couple days, Scrap Red Roars will be there
[3866.44 --> 3867.44]  Yes it will
[3867.44 --> 3868.44]  Which is so exciting
[3868.44 --> 3869.44]  I know
[3869.44 --> 3871.44]  I'm so interested in what happened with them
[3871.44 --> 3872.44]  Do we know how many episodes there are?
[3872.44 --> 3873.44]  Do you wanna talk
[3873.44 --> 3875.44]  Okay, uh, I believe
[3875.44 --> 3876.44]  Hold on, you know what?
[3876.44 --> 3878.44]  I don't wanna say something wrong
[3878.44 --> 3881.44]  So do you wanna talk about some of the beefing up that you've done?
[3881.44 --> 3882.44]  The beefing up?
[3882.44 --> 3883.44]  No
[3883.44 --> 3884.44]  Oh, you don't want to
[3884.44 --> 3885.44]  Nope, nope
[3885.44 --> 3886.44]  Not at all
[3886.44 --> 3887.44]  Oh
[3887.44 --> 3890.44]  I might make a post on the float plane sub forum
[3890.44 --> 3892.44]  How many episodes do you have?
[3892.44 --> 3893.44]  But I don't wanna talk about it
[3893.44 --> 3896.44]  Hopefully, everything will be fine
[3896.44 --> 3897.44]  Even people
[3897.44 --> 3898.44]  Let me, let me
[3898.44 --> 3900.44]  Give me one second
[3900.44 --> 3901.44]  I have an idea
[3901.44 --> 3902.44]  Nope
[3902.44 --> 3903.44]  Nope
[3903.44 --> 3904.44]  Not gonna work
[3904.44 --> 3905.44]  Seven?
[3905.44 --> 3906.44]  Seven?
[3906.44 --> 3907.44]  Is it really?
[3907.44 --> 3908.44]  Yeah
[3908.44 --> 3909.44]  Is it really?
[3909.44 --> 3910.44]  Yeah
[3910.44 --> 3912.44]  Is there a few people asking?
[3912.44 --> 3913.44]  Yeah
[3913.44 --> 3915.44]  You can probably do that
[3915.44 --> 3917.44]  Okay, hold on, hold on a minute
[3917.44 --> 3918.44]  Okay
[3918.44 --> 3919.44]  It's gonna be seven episodes
[3919.44 --> 3922.44]  Because the feedback people told you was too long
[3922.44 --> 3923.44]  Really?
[3923.44 --> 3924.44]  How long were episodes before?
[3924.44 --> 3925.44]  45 minutes
[3925.44 --> 3926.44]  45 minutes?
[3926.44 --> 3927.44]  45 minutes
[3927.44 --> 3928.44]  45 minutes?
[3928.44 --> 3929.44]  Well I could've told you that was too long
[3929.44 --> 3930.44]  How long are they now?
[3930.44 --> 3932.44]  45 minutes
[3932.44 --> 3933.44]  What?
[3933.44 --> 3934.44]  What?
[3934.44 --> 3935.44]  What?
[3935.44 --> 3936.44]  What?
[3936.44 --> 3939.44]  Seven episodes for the season?
[3939.44 --> 3940.44]  No
[3940.44 --> 3941.44]  Four episodes
[3941.44 --> 3942.44]  I hate you
[3942.44 --> 3944.44]  Are they actually 45 minutes?
[3944.44 --> 3945.44]  Yeah, they are 45 minutes
[3945.44 --> 3946.44]  45 minutes
[3946.44 --> 3947.44]  45 minute episodes?
[3947.44 --> 3949.44]  Isn't that how long the last ones were?
[3949.44 --> 3950.44]  I don't remember
[3950.44 --> 3952.44]  He keeps creeping up the run time
[3952.44 --> 3954.44]  He's gonna be doing three hour episodes
[3954.44 --> 3957.44]  He's just gonna start releasing the whole thing uncut at some point
[3957.44 --> 3958.44]  And see if I notice
[3959.44 --> 3960.44]  Just gonna be like
[3960.44 --> 3961.44]  Yeah, you know what?
[3961.44 --> 3963.44]  It was easier this way
[3963.44 --> 3965.44]  People tell me it's good though
[3965.44 --> 3966.44]  Okay
[3966.44 --> 3967.44]  Despite the run time
[3967.44 --> 3968.44]  It's good
[3968.44 --> 3969.44]  Some notable people are like
[3969.44 --> 3970.44]  Jay
[3970.44 --> 3971.44]  Ed Venom
[3971.44 --> 3972.44]  Okay
[3972.44 --> 3973.44]  Kyle
[3973.44 --> 3974.44]  Okay
[3974.44 --> 3975.44]  So
[3975.44 --> 3977.44]  Four episodes
[3977.44 --> 3979.44]  45 minutes each
[3979.44 --> 3981.44]  Coming over the next month
[3981.44 --> 3984.44]  I'm gonna drop that link in the chat again
[3984.44 --> 3987.44]  Because you guys should really get signed up for Floatplane Club
[3988.44 --> 3990.44]  It actually is pretty awesome
[3990.44 --> 3993.44]  I mean, do you want to talk about any of the cool stuff you're doing?
[3993.44 --> 3994.44]  Not really
[3994.44 --> 3995.44]  Oh
[3995.44 --> 3996.44]  You're such a
[3996.44 --> 3999.44]  You're such a killjoy right now
[3999.44 --> 4000.44]  Cause like
[4000.44 --> 4001.44]  I want to test it more
[4001.44 --> 4004.44]  The thing with Floatplane Club is if it works really well most people won't notice
[4005.44 --> 4006.44]  And that's like the point
[4007.44 --> 4008.44]  Yeah
[4008.44 --> 4009.44]  Cause it should just work
[4010.44 --> 4011.44]  No?
[4011.44 --> 4012.44]  I guess
[4013.44 --> 4014.44]  But that's like
[4014.44 --> 4015.44]  Okay, yep, that's fine
[4015.44 --> 4017.44]  Just keep me posted and everything will be fine
[4017.44 --> 4018.44]  Thank you
[4018.44 --> 4019.44]  Um
[4019.44 --> 4021.44]  Okay, hold on
[4021.44 --> 4022.44]  I just want to
[4022.44 --> 4024.44]  Can we try a live demo again?
[4024.44 --> 4025.44]  Yeah, yeah
[4025.44 --> 4027.44]  Okay, cause I think last time we tried one
[4027.44 --> 4028.44]  See like that's what
[4028.44 --> 4029.44]  I like that
[4029.44 --> 4030.44]  I just don't want to
[4030.44 --> 4031.44]  Okay
[4031.44 --> 4032.44]  Yeah
[4032.44 --> 4034.44]  I'll make a post about more stuff and I'll
[4035.44 --> 4037.44]  I'll figure out things that I want to talk about
[4037.44 --> 4038.44]  I just
[4038.44 --> 4039.44]  I don't really like
[4039.44 --> 4041.44]  Talking about things a ton before they've matured a little bit
[4041.44 --> 4043.44]  And I'm like sure that they're
[4044.44 --> 4045.44]  Fine
[4045.44 --> 4046.44]  Alright
[4046.44 --> 4047.44]  Alright
[4048.44 --> 4051.44]  And like if something fails with it or something weird
[4051.44 --> 4052.44]  I don't want people to be like
[4052.44 --> 4053.44]  What the heck?
[4053.44 --> 4058.44]  Alright, okay, so let's have a look at the world's smallest video drone video here
[4058.44 --> 4061.44]  Yes, the cancerous thumbnails are still there a lot of the time
[4061.44 --> 4063.44]  Look at that! Did you see that play?
[4064.44 --> 4065.44]  Okay, but hold on, hold on
[4065.44 --> 4066.44]  Cause we're going easy on it
[4066.44 --> 4067.44]  It'll take a second longer, yeah
[4067.44 --> 4068.44]  Okay, so 1080p
[4068.44 --> 4070.44]  Wow
[4070.44 --> 4072.44]  Look at that! Look at that preview!
[4072.44 --> 4074.44]  Look at how fast that loads in baby!
[4077.44 --> 4078.44]  Oh
[4078.44 --> 4079.44]  That's not too bad, you got some
[4079.44 --> 4080.44]  Ah, yeah, yeah, it wasn't too bad
[4080.44 --> 4081.44]  Look at that performance!
[4081.44 --> 4088.44]  Hey, do you remember when YouTube buffered so that you could skip ahead like nearly instantly like that?
[4088.44 --> 4090.44]  Do you remember the good old days?
[4090.44 --> 4094.44]  That's how every video player should work, I think
[4094.44 --> 4096.44]  Oh, I did a flip!
[4096.44 --> 4097.44]  I did a flip!
[4097.44 --> 4098.44]  Anyway, the point is
[4098.44 --> 4103.44]  To those wondering, Floatplane is working
[4103.44 --> 4107.44]  We are, it is more successful by the week
[4107.44 --> 4111.44]  Which is one of the reasons that we've been talking about it more on WAN Show
[4111.44 --> 4113.44]  There have been sort of less and less issues
[4113.44 --> 4114.44]  Yeah
[4114.44 --> 4115.44]  Week by week
[4115.44 --> 4120.44]  So yeah, we definitely recommend joining if you want the best Scrapyard Wars experience
[4120.44 --> 4124.44]  Some very exciting things happened in the last, I don't necessarily want to talk about them yet
[4124.44 --> 4131.44]  Maybe next week we'll see how well it goes and we'll see how much more like buffing up of it we do
[4131.44 --> 4135.44]  Because there might be more expansion that we do with it and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera
[4135.44 --> 4139.44]  But some really exciting things have happened recently that I thought were going to take like months to do
[4139.44 --> 4142.44]  Because Boiler's a genius and things went really well
[4142.44 --> 4149.44]  Contrary to the haters, did we get enough good applicants that you feel pretty good about our chances of development?
[4149.44 --> 4152.44]  Yeah, so we actually got a lot of really good applicants
[4152.44 --> 4156.44]  The coding challenge is finishing up this Sunday at midnight
[4156.44 --> 4159.44]  And some people have already started submitting their projects
[4159.44 --> 4161.44]  I don't know why, because they have the whole weekend
[4161.44 --> 4163.44]  But I guess they're busy over the weekend
[4163.44 --> 4170.44]  And some of the projects that I've seen already so far are like pretty good
[4170.44 --> 4178.44]  Yeah, so I'm even more excited to like see what people take the whole weekend to finish up polishing and all that kind of stuff
[4178.44 --> 4181.44]  But I'm not going to grade anybody any different depending on when they handed it in
[4181.44 --> 4183.44]  See, I've got to address this
[4183.44 --> 4189.44]  The same thing was said about Vessel, how successful it was and it was an epic failure in the end
[4189.44 --> 4190.44]  So eat it Linus
[4190.44 --> 4194.44]  The thing is is that Vessel had a very different model
[4194.44 --> 4201.44]  Vessel was a start-up with like over a hundred million dollars we think of venture capital
[4201.44 --> 4205.44]  That they managed to burn through in 18 months
[4205.44 --> 4211.44]  Now I've never had any outside investment
[4211.44 --> 4221.44]  So that is not the way that I personally run the businesses that I own and or am a stakeholder in
[4221.44 --> 4224.44]  It is not the way that I believe in doing business
[4224.44 --> 4230.44]  Having a really high burn rate and just kind of hoping that
[4230.44 --> 4234.44]  Well, I don't know what they were hoping for to be perfectly honest
[4234.44 --> 4238.44]  Now that we know how their infrastructure worked, it was way too expensive
[4238.44 --> 4242.44]  I don't know how they could have ever possibly hoped to make a profit
[4242.44 --> 4248.44]  I feel like the goal the whole time was just to try to get eaten and bought out by somebody
[4248.44 --> 4250.44]  Because like it seems insane
[4250.44 --> 4256.44]  So remember too though, the people saying what a great huge success that Vessel was
[4256.44 --> 4260.44]  Were the people that were trying to talk other people into joining it
[4260.44 --> 4266.44]  Or complete outsiders from like an investor relation standpoint
[4266.44 --> 4268.44]  Yeah
[4268.44 --> 4270.44]  We don't need investors
[4270.44 --> 4274.44]  And we are not recruiting anybody to join Floatplane Club at this time
[4274.44 --> 4278.44]  We are just really happy that an internal project is going really really well
[4278.44 --> 4281.44]  And to be fair if we were saying that Vessel was going well
[4281.44 --> 4282.44]  We were probably talking about like well
[4282.44 --> 4283.44]  For us
[4283.44 --> 4285.44]  Our production schedule is working
[4285.44 --> 4286.44]  Yup
[4286.44 --> 4288.44]  And our fans seem to be happy and that kind of stuff
[4288.44 --> 4291.44]  We weren't talking about like profit structures and whatever else
[4291.44 --> 4292.44]  Yeah
[4292.44 --> 4295.44]  Um
[4295.44 --> 4297.44]  So yeah
[4297.44 --> 4298.44]  No hotkeys and stuff
[4298.44 --> 4300.44]  That is a thing that will happen eventually
[4300.44 --> 4301.44]  Yeah
[4301.44 --> 4303.44]  So we are not going to work on that yet
[4303.44 --> 4306.44]  Ah, what if we don't have a credit card to use on PayPal for Floatplane
[4306.44 --> 4308.44]  That is something that we are working on
[4308.44 --> 4310.44]  Can we give any progress update on that?
[4310.44 --> 4311.44]  Uh
[4311.44 --> 4317.44]  The final site that is being developed on will be using Stripe and PayPal
[4317.44 --> 4319.44]  So if you can't use PayPal for whatever reason
[4319.44 --> 4322.44]  There's various reasons why you might not be able to use PayPal
[4322.44 --> 4325.44]  We can accept whatever cards through Stripe
[4325.44 --> 4327.44]  And Stripe has a lot of different things that they can accept
[4327.44 --> 4329.44]  They're a pretty good system
[4329.44 --> 4332.44]  Yeah, so it won't be tied to just PayPal forever
[4332.44 --> 4335.44]  While it's on the forum, it will be just PayPal
[4335.44 --> 4336.44]  Yeah
[4336.44 --> 4337.44]  Yeah
[4337.44 --> 4338.44]  Yeah
[4338.44 --> 4339.44]  Um
[4339.44 --> 4340.44]  You know what?
[4340.44 --> 4342.44]  There's a lot of actually pretty decent questions in here
[4342.44 --> 4344.44]  Why don't we stop the LAN show and do a short after party?
[4344.44 --> 4345.44]  Sure
[4345.44 --> 4346.44]  Okay
[4346.44 --> 4348.44]  So thanks for watching, same bad time, same bad channel, bye
[4348.44 --> 4350.44]  Move back in a second
[4350.44 --> 4351.44]  Wait a second
[4361.44 --> 4363.44]  How dare you tell me to go away?
[4363.44 --> 4364.44]  You cuttlefish back
[4364.44 --> 4365.44]  How dare you?
[4365.44 --> 4370.44]  I know you would dare to do far more than that to me
[4370.44 --> 4375.44]  What's the video doing?
[4375.44 --> 4376.44]  Uh, still streaming
[4376.44 --> 4377.44]  Oh
[4377.44 --> 4379.44]  And we're also doing a short after party, so
[4379.44 --> 4380.44]  Oh, okay
[4380.44 --> 4381.44]  Uh
[4381.44 --> 4382.44]  I'll see you next time
[4382.44 --> 4383.44]  I'll see you next time
