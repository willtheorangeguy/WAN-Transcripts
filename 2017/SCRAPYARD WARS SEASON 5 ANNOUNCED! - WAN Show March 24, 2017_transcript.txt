[0.00 --> 7.00]  It's WAN Show time!
[7.00 --> 8.00]  Woo!
[8.00 --> 9.00]  Hooray!
[9.00 --> 11.00]  Okay, oh man.
[11.00 --> 13.00]  I am like sweating right now.
[13.00 --> 14.00]  You just did a thing.
[14.00 --> 17.00]  We had a bit of a situation before the show.
[17.00 --> 18.00]  Quite a disaster.
[18.00 --> 24.00]  So that video will probably be up in about, I guess about a week or so after editing.
[24.00 --> 25.00]  Yeah?
[25.00 --> 27.00]  Yeah.
[27.00 --> 31.00]  So there's some pretty big news for this week.
[31.00 --> 34.00]  SourceFed is gone!
[34.00 --> 36.00]  Exploded!
[36.00 --> 43.00]  And I actually, I have, even though I've never really watched the show, Brendan, can you just tilt us up a bit?
[43.00 --> 44.00]  Our belly buttons are showing.
[44.00 --> 48.00]  I don't think Twitch allows the mid-rift show.
[48.00 --> 49.00]  Yeah.
[49.00 --> 52.00]  So our, what was I saying?
[52.00 --> 53.00]  Right, right, right.
[53.00 --> 59.00]  I have a little bit to say about that because I've actually kind of modeled our business after SourceFed.
[59.00 --> 61.00]  SourceFed specifically?
[61.00 --> 62.00]  There's a hint.
[62.00 --> 63.00]  Jeez.
[63.00 --> 67.00]  Alright, well it was nice to be on the show with you guys.
[67.00 --> 69.00]  I guess we look for another job.
[69.00 --> 71.00]  There's a lot more Ryzen news this week.
[71.00 --> 72.00]  How unexpected-molated.
[72.00 --> 73.00]  What else we got?
[73.00 --> 82.00]  I love how, one thing before I keep going, I love how our Ryzen news for the last few weeks has been like one of X amount.
[82.00 --> 83.00]  Yeah.
[83.00 --> 85.00]  Just like, these are the many Ryzen topics that there are.
[85.00 --> 87.00]  Which is good, because we have something to talk about.
[87.00 --> 90.00]  Twitter might build a paid subscription service for power users.
[90.00 --> 91.00]  And?
[91.00 --> 94.00]  We're going to announce that right now?
[94.00 --> 95.00]  Yeah!
[95.00 --> 99.00]  We're going to announce that, we're going to announce it.
[99.00 --> 103.00]  There is a big announcement coming in probably about 14 minutes.
[103.00 --> 104.00]  Should I go that way?
[104.00 --> 111.00]  No, no, we can say what it is, but not any of the details around what will happen in about 14 minutes.
[111.00 --> 112.00]  Scrapyard Wars 5.
[112.00 --> 113.00]  Yeah.
[113.00 --> 116.00]  Is planned and is happening like...
[116.00 --> 117.00]  Imminently.
[117.00 --> 119.00]  Very, very soon.
[119.00 --> 121.00]  As in like, a couple days.
[121.00 --> 124.00]  Not a couple months, or a couple weeks.
[124.00 --> 125.00]  Yeah.
[130.00 --> 133.00]  I'm still not quite sure how we're going to do this.
[133.00 --> 136.00]  I think I've got a plan.
[136.00 --> 137.00]  Okay.
[137.00 --> 139.00]  But I will try the way to go.
[139.00 --> 146.00]  I fixed it!
[146.00 --> 148.00]  Zotac!
[148.00 --> 150.00]  I just won't be able to heal.
[150.00 --> 151.00]  Moss!
[151.00 --> 152.00]  Oh, that would be terrible.
[152.00 --> 153.00]  But you can monitor through the thing.
[153.00 --> 154.00]  That would be terrible.
[154.00 --> 156.00]  You know what?
[156.00 --> 158.00]  We will figure it out live.
[158.00 --> 159.00]  Yeah.
[159.00 --> 160.00]  Because that's what we do.
[160.00 --> 161.00]  Do it live!
[161.00 --> 162.00]  Do it live from the side of the road.
[162.00 --> 164.00]  Do you have two headphone outputs on there?
[164.00 --> 165.00]  And are they both quarter inch?
[165.00 --> 168.00]  I have a thing that I have to do.
[168.00 --> 173.00]  I watched someone set up two months ago.
[173.00 --> 175.00]  It has monitoring ports though, right?
[175.00 --> 176.00]  Yes.
[176.00 --> 177.00]  Two of them?
[177.00 --> 178.00]  Cool.
[178.00 --> 183.00]  So someone moved the monitors that are supposed to be left here.
[183.00 --> 184.00]  Oh my god.
[184.00 --> 189.00]  And so the ones that are plugged into the port that the monitors are supposed to be plugged into.
[189.00 --> 191.00]  Would that be the adapter jack right there then?
[191.00 --> 192.00]  Maybe.
[192.00 --> 195.00]  But also, probably not.
[196.00 --> 197.00]  So there's that.
[197.00 --> 198.00]  Okay.
[198.00 --> 200.00]  So we're not sure how we're going to have that call, but we're not going to explain what that call is.
[200.00 --> 201.00]  So!
[201.00 --> 202.00]  Yes!
[202.00 --> 203.00]  First topic of the day.
[203.00 --> 206.00]  Why don't we, can we jump right into SourceFed?
[206.00 --> 207.00]  Sure.
[207.00 --> 208.00]  Okay.
[208.00 --> 212.00]  So SourceFed, ah, shutting down.
[212.00 --> 215.00]  I'm just going to go ahead and pull up there.
[215.00 --> 217.00]  SourceFed is shutting down.
[217.00 --> 218.00]  It's on Reddit.
[218.00 --> 219.00]  It's on Amplify.
[219.00 --> 221.00]  Where is the actual video?
[221.00 --> 223.00]  It's not in the doc.
[223.00 --> 225.00]  So, I don't have a link for you guys.
[225.00 --> 226.00]  There's a Philip DeFranco video, right?
[226.00 --> 227.00]  Is that what you're talking about?
[227.00 --> 228.00]  No!
[228.00 --> 230.00]  No, the one where like the hosts are all, oh here it is.
[230.00 --> 231.00]  Oh, here we go, here we go, here we go.
[231.00 --> 232.00]  Okay.
[232.00 --> 238.00]  So Linus' screen, is that just a capture of the thumbnail and not an embed?
[238.00 --> 239.00]  Ha!
[239.00 --> 240.00]  Really?
[240.00 --> 241.00]  There you go.
[241.00 --> 242.00]  There we go.
[242.00 --> 243.00]  Yeah.
[243.00 --> 246.00]  Because that, that shouldn't, that couldn't just be at the top.
[246.00 --> 250.00]  Um, so basically here are a bunch of hosts, none of whom I recognize.
[250.00 --> 251.00]  No.
[251.00 --> 255.00]  And, um, they're sad because they all lost their jobs.
[255.00 --> 260.00]  Uh, apparently there were about 40 people working at SourceFed at this point.
[260.00 --> 261.00]  40 people!
[261.00 --> 262.00]  That's sort of insane.
[262.00 --> 268.00]  So the history behind SourceFed is that, uh, and you'll have to correct me if I got this
[268.00 --> 274.00]  wrong, cause I've, as much as I've sort of modeled some of what we do here after it,
[274.00 --> 277.00]  I, um, how do I say this?
[277.00 --> 281.00]  I, I have never actually watched a full episode of SourceFed.
[281.00 --> 282.00]  Yeah, so how have you done that?
[282.00 --> 283.00]  I don't understand.
[283.00 --> 285.00]  Well, no, this isn't, okay, okay, so, you got, look.
[285.00 --> 286.00]  There's a live stream right now.
[286.00 --> 287.00]  Look, just, just, watch this.
[287.00 --> 288.00]  Yeah, this is their final live stream.
[288.00 --> 289.00]  Watch this one.
[289.00 --> 290.00]  Yeah, watch this live stream.
[290.00 --> 291.00]  We'll talk about theirs.
[291.00 --> 292.00]  That one will be archived.
[292.00 --> 293.00]  Yeah.
[293.00 --> 296.00]  Discovery has already come out and said they're not removing the videos, so you'll have plenty
[296.00 --> 299.00]  of opportunities to go watch that live stream later.
[299.00 --> 303.00]  Um, but basically, in and out, okay, right, right, right, right, right.
[303.00 --> 304.00]  Sorry, I'm very scattered right now.
[304.00 --> 305.00]  I've been kind of running around.
[305.00 --> 306.00]  That's okay.
[306.00 --> 308.00]  There's, there's some crazy stuff went down.
[308.00 --> 310.00]  You guys will see a video about it in about a week.
[310.00 --> 314.00]  So, remember how we talked, I think it was last week or two weeks ago, about how I modeled
[314.00 --> 318.00]  WAN Show after some other tech podcast that I had never watched.
[318.00 --> 321.00]  Yeah, okay, yeah, like three weeks ago?
[321.00 --> 322.00]  Yeah, maybe.
[322.00 --> 323.00]  Okay.
[323.00 --> 324.00]  Same thing.
[324.00 --> 326.00]  So, basically, it's me kind of...
[326.00 --> 329.00]  So, here's a name and a description, I'll base a company off of it.
[329.00 --> 332.00]  Well, no, no, it's not basic the company off of it.
[332.00 --> 342.00]  So, it's, I viewed SourceFed as a validation that the model of bringing a group of people
[342.00 --> 350.00]  together and creating multiple channels, but rather than through a multi-channel network,
[350.00 --> 354.00]  like an MCN that is just acting as sort of in an agency role for a bunch of independent...
[354.00 --> 360.00]  Having a company that runs all the different channels instead of a company that, like, does
[360.00 --> 361.00]  things for all the different channels.
[361.00 --> 362.00]  Yes.
[362.00 --> 368.00]  And so, I kind of looked at that and I went, okay, they're making it work.
[368.00 --> 369.00]  They've...
[369.00 --> 371.00]  They're making this...
[371.00 --> 377.00]  They're able to monetize it effectively enough that they've managed to keep the lights on.
[377.00 --> 378.00]  So, they were like a proof of concept for me.
[378.00 --> 380.00]  Okay, I remember these talks now.
[380.00 --> 381.00]  Yeah.
[381.00 --> 383.00]  And now they're gone.
[383.00 --> 385.00]  So, basically, what happened...
[385.00 --> 386.00]  So, we've got to follow the trend.
[386.00 --> 387.00]  Yeah, you'll have to...
[387.00 --> 388.00]  No.
[388.00 --> 389.00]  You'll have to correct me.
[389.00 --> 394.00]  You'll have to bear with me if I get some of the details wrong because I didn't really follow the channel.
[394.00 --> 396.00]  I think it's like news or something.
[396.00 --> 397.00]  Yeah.
[397.00 --> 404.00]  Anyway, so, Phil DeFranco, who had a news show way back a zillion years ago, sort of one of, like, the YouTubers.
[404.00 --> 405.00]  You know, it was like...
[405.00 --> 406.00]  He still does.
[406.00 --> 408.00]  Well, I know he does now, but he's not, like, the guy anymore.
[408.00 --> 413.00]  It's like, we're talking back when Ray William Johnson was the top subscribed channel on YouTube.
[413.00 --> 414.00]  Right.
[414.00 --> 417.00]  You would utter Phil DeFranco's name in the same breath.
[417.00 --> 420.00]  Like, these guys were the OG big YouTubers.
[420.00 --> 422.00]  He's getting, like...
[422.00 --> 424.00]  Yeah, he's big again, but he's not even...
[424.00 --> 427.00]  Like, I think he's an order of magnitude behind PewDiePie.
[427.00 --> 429.00]  But the amount of views per video that he's getting...
[429.00 --> 430.00]  Yep.
[430.00 --> 431.00]  ...is putting him up there.
[431.00 --> 432.00]  He's doing...
[432.00 --> 435.00]  Like, he had kind of fallen off the rails a bit, and he's doing really well again.
[435.00 --> 448.00]  Anyway, the point is, he's OG, and back when Google did an initial round of funding big creators to create, like, custom content for the platform.
[448.00 --> 449.00]  This?
[449.00 --> 450.00]  What's that?
[450.00 --> 452.00]  He does this, like, this thing.
[452.00 --> 453.00]  Do you see that?
[453.00 --> 454.00]  Oh, the thing that he does in his thumbnails?
[454.00 --> 456.00]  He does that in, like, every thumbnail.
[456.00 --> 457.00]  Illuminati?
[457.00 --> 458.00]  Oh.
[458.00 --> 459.00]  Maybe that's it.
[459.00 --> 460.00]  Maybe you figured it out.
[460.00 --> 461.00]  You know what?
[461.00 --> 462.00]  Yes!
[462.00 --> 463.00]  We're... this... the show's probably gonna...
[463.00 --> 464.00]  How to survive on YouTube.
[464.00 --> 466.00]  The show's gonna get pulled down now.
[466.00 --> 467.00]  Yeah.
[467.00 --> 468.00]  Because we've uncovered the secret.
[468.00 --> 470.00]  I mean, you know that the SWAT team is right outside that door, right?
[470.00 --> 471.00]  Yeah, of course.
[471.00 --> 472.00]  Yeah.
[472.00 --> 473.00]  Okay.
[473.00 --> 474.00]  Well, no, because they're cool with us, because that's how we got here, too.
[474.00 --> 476.00]  You said you modeled it after SourceFed.
[476.00 --> 477.00]  That's where the source is.
[477.00 --> 478.00]  Oh, lord.
[478.00 --> 480.00]  We only made it as a company because of the...
[480.00 --> 481.00]  The source.
[481.00 --> 482.00]  Yeah.
[482.00 --> 483.00]  We were fed by the source.
[483.00 --> 484.00]  Anyway.
[484.00 --> 486.00]  The source also is shutting down.
[486.00 --> 487.00]  So there's that.
[487.00 --> 488.00]  Source by Circuit City.
[488.00 --> 489.00]  Don't name your name.
[489.00 --> 490.00]  Don't name your company.
[490.00 --> 491.00]  Something to do with source.
[491.00 --> 492.00]  Yeah.
[492.00 --> 495.00]  Source seems to be a bad, bad, bad place to... bad place to head.
[495.00 --> 496.00]  Okay.
[496.00 --> 498.00]  So he got funding to start up SourceFed.
[498.00 --> 499.00]  Completely different channel.
[499.00 --> 501.00]  Also based around, like, daily news.
[501.00 --> 504.00]  Very, very quick, up-to-date daily news.
[504.00 --> 505.00]  Yeah.
[505.00 --> 507.00]  From there, they expanded.
[507.00 --> 508.00]  Dramatically.
[508.00 --> 511.00]  I don't remember what happened first.
[511.00 --> 516.00]  Phil getting the offer from Discovery Network or D3 or Discovery Channel.
[516.00 --> 517.00]  Whatever.
[517.00 --> 518.00]  Discovery.
[518.00 --> 521.00]  Phil getting the offer from Discovery to become, like, an exec of some sort there.
[521.00 --> 524.00]  And then they acquired the show or something like that.
[524.00 --> 526.00]  Or I don't know if that happened first.
[526.00 --> 530.00]  Or they started up the other shows under the SourceFed umbrella.
[530.00 --> 531.00]  Like, SourceFed nerd.
[531.00 --> 532.00]  Yeah.
[532.00 --> 534.00]  I also don't know, but I think they were acquired first.
[534.00 --> 535.00]  Yeah.
[535.00 --> 536.00]  Okay.
[536.00 --> 537.00]  But all that stuff kind of happened.
[537.00 --> 539.00]  And they had kind of a good thing going on.
[539.00 --> 542.00]  They were, you know, Sexy Phil's channel.
[542.00 --> 544.00]  So his original channel was kind of...
[545.00 --> 546.00]  Doing okay.
[546.00 --> 547.00]  But, like, SourceFed was growing.
[547.00 --> 548.00]  SourceFed nerd was growing real fast.
[548.00 --> 550.00]  And everything was going gangbusters.
[550.00 --> 562.00]  And then, you know, I don't know how these things happen, but the hosts of SourceFed got so popular that they were just like, peace, bruh.
[562.00 --> 563.00]  I'ma go indie.
[563.00 --> 564.00]  And, uh...
[564.00 --> 565.00]  Like all of them.
[565.00 --> 566.00]  Yes.
[566.00 --> 567.00]  Literally.
[567.00 --> 568.00]  Yeah.
[568.00 --> 569.00]  Literally all of them.
[569.00 --> 572.00]  And what happened was it became kind of a revolving door.
[572.00 --> 579.00]  Even at their height, I couldn't really figure out what the monetization model was there.
[579.00 --> 582.00]  Because Brandon actually worked on a live show that they did here.
[582.00 --> 583.00]  Yeah.
[583.00 --> 584.00]  You knew that, right?
[584.00 --> 585.00]  Yeah.
[585.00 --> 586.00]  So he was like...
[586.00 --> 588.00]  He actually has a clause in his contract that...
[588.00 --> 589.00]  Oh, no.
[589.00 --> 590.00]  I wasn't calling you.
[590.00 --> 591.00]  Oh.
[591.00 --> 592.00]  Okay.
[592.00 --> 593.00]  I was like...
[593.00 --> 594.00]  I was like...
[594.00 --> 595.00]  I was like...
[595.00 --> 596.00]  And I was like...
[596.00 --> 597.00]  I was like...
[597.00 --> 598.00]  I was like...
[598.00 --> 601.00]  I really like these guys.
[601.00 --> 602.00]  Uh...
[602.00 --> 603.00]  They need a camera guy.
[603.00 --> 604.00]  They're gonna be, like, here doing a show.
[604.00 --> 605.00]  Yeah.
[605.00 --> 606.00]  They were, like, touring.
[606.00 --> 607.00]  This was, like, a one-time thing.
[607.00 --> 608.00]  He was like, can I do it?
[608.00 --> 609.00]  I'm like, yeah.
[609.00 --> 610.00]  That's super cool.
[610.00 --> 611.00]  And what's...
[611.00 --> 615.00]  The funny thing is, I actually ended up taking his ticket and going on a date with Brandon's girlfriend.
[615.00 --> 616.00]  Because...
[616.00 --> 617.00]  Oh, this is the story you're telling me?
[617.00 --> 618.00]  Yeah.
[618.00 --> 620.00]  I'm like, wait, what's going on?
[620.00 --> 623.00]  Yeah, I thought you heard your name and came running out here.
[623.00 --> 624.00]  No.
[624.00 --> 625.00]  Yeah, I was talking about you.
[625.00 --> 627.00]  Were your ears burning?
[627.00 --> 629.00]  So, Brandon bailed on his girlfriend...
[629.00 --> 630.00]  Yeah.
[630.00 --> 633.00]  To actually camera op for their live show.
[633.00 --> 635.00]  And I took his seat, because I was, like, really curious.
[635.00 --> 639.00]  Because, like I said, I was really interested in their business model.
[639.00 --> 640.00]  Yeah.
[640.00 --> 641.00]  And I was like, oh, these live shows.
[641.00 --> 642.00]  This is kind of interesting.
[642.00 --> 643.00]  Um...
[643.00 --> 649.00]  So, anyway, he discovered at that time that they had, like, 40, 50 people working there.
[649.00 --> 650.00]  And this is at a time...
[650.00 --> 651.00]  Insane.
[651.00 --> 652.00]  ...when we had five, I think?
[652.00 --> 655.00]  Back then, if it wasn't five, it was six or something.
[655.00 --> 657.00]  I think it was OGs plus Taryn.
[657.00 --> 658.00]  I don't...
[658.00 --> 659.00]  She might actually know things about SourceFed.
[659.00 --> 660.00]  Oh, seriously.
[660.00 --> 661.00]  Okay.
[661.00 --> 662.00]  This might legitimately be helpful.
[662.00 --> 663.00]  Well, here we go.
[663.00 --> 664.00]  It's happening again.
[664.00 --> 665.00]  Uh...
[665.00 --> 666.00]  Yeah.
[666.00 --> 667.00]  Hi.
[667.00 --> 668.00]  Hi, Mrs. Lafreniere.
[668.00 --> 669.00]  Hey!
[669.00 --> 670.00]  How you doing?
[670.00 --> 672.00]  Oh, I was great.
[672.00 --> 684.00]  No, I just phoned in to say that I have watched Phil DeFranco since he started with his backwards baseball cap and one sparkly earring.
[684.00 --> 688.00]  And I've been a fan of his forever and ever.
[688.00 --> 689.00]  He's great.
[689.00 --> 690.00]  Really loved him.
[690.00 --> 694.00]  He handpicked the original SourceFed troupe.
[694.00 --> 695.00]  Um...
[695.00 --> 697.00]  And it was an awesome, awesome show.
[697.00 --> 698.00]  And then, of course, he...
[698.00 --> 701.00]  He hasn't had anything to do with it for a few years.
[701.00 --> 706.00]  Which, in my opinion, is why maybe it didn't keep going well.
[706.00 --> 708.00]  But I just wanted to shout out Phil DeFranco.
[708.00 --> 710.00]  I've been watching him forever.
[710.00 --> 711.00]  And he's awesome.
[711.00 --> 713.00]  Okay, so...
[713.00 --> 714.00]  Okay.
[714.00 --> 722.00]  So the hidden message here, then, is that you want me to make sure that I'm micromanaging everything at LMG...
[723.00 --> 724.00]  No!
[724.00 --> 725.00]  ...so that it doesn't explode.
[725.00 --> 728.00]  Is that what Mom Lafreniere is kind of throwing at me?
[728.00 --> 729.00]  Because I'm picking that up.
[729.00 --> 730.00]  Except for...
[730.00 --> 733.00]  No, I think you're not smelling very good what I'm cooking here, Lionel.
[733.00 --> 734.00]  Pwoh!
[734.00 --> 735.00]  Pwoh!
[737.00 --> 738.00]  Alright, got it.
[738.00 --> 739.00]  Got it.
[739.00 --> 740.00]  Read you loud and clear.
[740.00 --> 741.00]  Phil is better than me.
[741.00 --> 742.00]  And, um...
[742.00 --> 744.00]  His influence is good and mine is bad.
[744.00 --> 745.00]  Now...
[745.00 --> 746.00]  Now am I...
[746.00 --> 747.00]  Am I closer?
[747.00 --> 749.00]  You are not picking up what I'm putting down at all.
[749.00 --> 750.00]  Okay, what's up, Mom?
[750.00 --> 751.00]  Aww!
[751.00 --> 752.00]  No, I...
[752.00 --> 753.00]  I just shout out Phil.
[753.00 --> 756.00]  I watched him because, uh, when he started out, he was sort of the...
[756.00 --> 758.00]  The same age as you and your brother.
[758.00 --> 761.00]  And I wanted to be up on what was going on in your lives.
[761.00 --> 766.00]  So I watched him and I've watched him grow and get married and have kids and he's an awesome dude.
[766.00 --> 767.00]  That's all I wanted to say.
[767.00 --> 768.00]  Do you have any comments about...
[768.00 --> 770.00]  About SourceFed?
[770.00 --> 773.00]  I liked SourceFed when he was running it.
[773.00 --> 778.00]  And as soon as he stepped away, in my opinion, it wasn't the same and it wasn't...
[778.00 --> 782.00]  It didn't have the integrity that it had once he left.
[782.00 --> 783.00]  Okay.
[783.00 --> 784.00]  Got it.
[784.00 --> 785.00]  Alright.
[785.00 --> 786.00]  Okay, thanks Mom.
[786.00 --> 787.00]  So there you have it.
[787.00 --> 788.00]  There you have it, kids.
[788.00 --> 789.00]  That, my friends...
[789.00 --> 790.00]  Bye.
[790.00 --> 792.00]  ...is how to relate to your children.
[792.00 --> 793.00]  Okay?
[793.00 --> 794.00]  Nope.
[794.00 --> 797.00]  And be like, up on what's going on in their lives.
[797.00 --> 798.00]  She's...
[798.00 --> 799.00]  Watching the same shows they do.
[799.00 --> 800.00]  Seriously.
[800.00 --> 801.00]  She was hardcore about it too.
[801.00 --> 803.00]  Like, I remember there was one time...
[803.00 --> 807.00]  I've probably said this story on WAN a long, long, long time ago, but...
[807.00 --> 810.00]  My dad yelled across from the house asking if I wanted to go to the bank.
[810.00 --> 811.00]  Mm-hmm.
[811.00 --> 812.00]  And I was like, yeah.
[812.00 --> 815.00]  And we both just sat there and Mom went and got ready.
[815.00 --> 818.00]  And then was like standing by the door and he's like, are we gonna go to the bank?
[818.00 --> 820.00]  And we were talking about the bank in World of Warcraft.
[820.00 --> 821.00]  Oh.
[821.00 --> 824.00]  And then, so that was the day that she decided to just play it to figure out what was going on.
[824.00 --> 827.00]  She got to level like 40 or something and she was like, okay, yeah, I get it.
[827.00 --> 831.00]  She played Skyrim too just because I really liked the Elder Scrolls games.
[831.00 --> 832.00]  Yeah.
[832.00 --> 833.00]  So she was like, I'll figure out what's going on here.
[833.00 --> 834.00]  Mom's always been gung-ho about things.
[834.00 --> 835.00]  Thanks for calling, Mom.
[835.00 --> 839.00]  Yeah, we've got Twitch chat saying you should do the same drugs your kids do.
[839.00 --> 842.00]  I think that was really not where we were going with that.
[842.00 --> 843.00]  No.
[843.00 --> 844.00]  At all.
[844.00 --> 845.00]  So, yeah.
[845.00 --> 846.00]  No.
[846.00 --> 849.00]  Experiencing similar content and doing drugs is not the same thing.
[849.00 --> 850.00]  Not the same thing.
[850.00 --> 851.00]  Okay.
[851.00 --> 852.00]  Rise in news.
[852.00 --> 853.00]  Yes.
[853.00 --> 856.00]  There is some rise in news this week.
[856.00 --> 857.00]  Loads.
[857.00 --> 862.00]  So, it looks like, let's go ahead and pull this up.
[862.00 --> 863.00]  Are you on a dot?
[863.00 --> 864.00]  No, no, don't worry.
[864.00 --> 865.00]  I'm good.
[865.00 --> 871.00]  This was originally posted on the forum by Doc Swag, who has one of the better usernames
[871.00 --> 873.00]  that I think I have yet encountered on the forum.
[873.00 --> 874.00]  That's pretty good.
[874.00 --> 879.00]  And this is, so the source here is from r slash AMD.
[879.00 --> 881.00]  Let's go ahead and pull that up here.
[881.00 --> 889.00]  And it was a response from AMD talking about Infinity Fabric, how the CCX modules are hooked
[889.00 --> 892.00]  up to the integrated memory controllers.
[892.00 --> 899.00]  And basically, the summary here, so the important bits, is that the Infinity Fabric connects each
[899.00 --> 907.00]  CCX to, and so those are, so the eight cores have multiple CCXs, so two four core CCXs.
[907.00 --> 909.00]  They're kind of like modules or something.
[909.00 --> 916.00]  So, each CCX to un-core, so not processing core devices like memory controllers, PCI Express controllers,
[916.00 --> 918.00]  SATA USB, etc.
[918.00 --> 926.00]  It's a 256-bit bi-directional crossbar and runs at the speed of the memory controller.
[926.00 --> 936.00]  So, effectively increasing your memory speed increases the clock speed of the Infinity Fabric.
[936.00 --> 941.00]  This is enlightening for a number of reasons.
[941.00 --> 949.00]  So, number one is that it was pretty confusing to me that it had been an awful long time since
[949.00 --> 954.00]  system memory had been any kind of a bottleneck in a desktop workload.
[954.00 --> 955.00]  An awful long time.
[955.00 --> 961.00]  And all of a sudden, Ryzen comes in and all of a sudden, you know, AMD's putting together a guide
[961.00 --> 964.00]  for how to overclock Ryzen, like recommendations.
[964.00 --> 966.00]  They're like, yeah, we're really focused on like memory overclocking.
[966.00 --> 968.00]  I'm like, what?
[968.00 --> 969.00]  Memory overclocking?
[969.00 --> 970.00]  Are you kidding me?
[970.00 --> 971.00]  How's that?
[971.00 --> 972.00]  How's that important?
[972.00 --> 973.00]  You got dual channel DDR4.
[973.00 --> 977.00]  Isn't that an awful lot of memory clock speed?
[977.00 --> 985.00]  And so it turns out that it actually affects not just the communication between the processing
[985.00 --> 991.00]  cores and the DRAM, but also the communication between the processing cores.
[991.00 --> 994.00]  Very, very interesting.
[994.00 --> 996.00]  I'm setting up the call stuff.
[996.00 --> 997.00]  Oh, you are?
[997.00 --> 998.00]  Well, that's wonderful.
[998.00 --> 1001.00]  Nick, did you want something?
[1001.00 --> 1002.00]  Or?
[1002.00 --> 1003.00]  Oh, okay.
[1003.00 --> 1004.00]  Yeah.
[1004.00 --> 1005.00]  Don't worry.
[1005.00 --> 1006.00]  Yeah, working on it.
[1006.00 --> 1007.00]  We got this.
[1007.00 --> 1009.00]  If you want to like help Jake, I guess that's the only thing.
[1009.00 --> 1010.00]  Or don't.
[1010.00 --> 1011.00]  He's working on it.
[1011.00 --> 1012.00]  Doesn't matter.
[1012.00 --> 1014.00]  Jake is rounding some stuff up.
[1014.00 --> 1016.00]  It's not, he's probably got it.
[1016.00 --> 1017.00]  It's not a big deal.
[1017.00 --> 1018.00]  Alright.
[1018.00 --> 1020.00]  We've got more Ryzen news.
[1020.00 --> 1021.00]  Yeah.
[1021.00 --> 1022.00]  So there's a fix coming.
[1022.00 --> 1026.00]  This was originally posted on the forum by, I'm just going to have a look here.
[1026.00 --> 1028.00]  We haven't briefed James.
[1028.00 --> 1029.00]  James.
[1029.00 --> 1032.00]  I feel like he's my Newman right now.
[1032.00 --> 1033.00]  James.
[1033.00 --> 1038.00]  We haven't briefed him on how to put the OP for the forum post in the docs so that we
[1038.00 --> 1040.00]  don't actually have to click it before we say that.
[1040.00 --> 1041.00]  Morgan NLGman.
[1041.00 --> 1043.00]  Okay, that's a pretty good username too.
[1043.00 --> 1044.00]  That's pretty solid.
[1044.00 --> 1046.00]  Yeah, that, I'm actually, wow.
[1046.00 --> 1050.00]  We are getting some good, I mean look at this profile picture.
[1050.00 --> 1053.00]  That profile picture is amazing.
[1053.00 --> 1064.50]  I mean that is some, that is some dank AF meme action that Morgan NLGman's got going
[1064.50 --> 1065.50]  on there.
[1065.50 --> 1066.50]  Anyway.
[1066.50 --> 1070.00]  So TLDR, the original source is heist.de.
[1070.00 --> 1076.00]  There's an FMA3 related bug in Ryzen CPUs which causes a hard system lock when running certain
[1076.00 --> 1077.00]  FMA3 workloads.
[1077.00 --> 1082.00]  So the problem was replicated across all three R7 processors released so far and tested on
[1082.00 --> 1084.00]  a variety of motherboards.
[1084.00 --> 1087.00]  It all started over on the hardware bot forums.
[1087.00 --> 1090.00]  But basically there's a bios fix confirmed for the issue.
[1090.00 --> 1095.00]  AMD is well aware of it and Digital Trends reported a first hand talk with AMD about it.
[1095.00 --> 1100.00]  Which you can check out at the link that I'm going to go ahead and drop in the Twitch chat.
[1100.00 --> 1105.00]  And this is a fun fact for those of you who don't, check out the forum thread that's linked under the
[1105.00 --> 1107.00]  archive of the WAN show regularly.
[1107.00 --> 1112.00]  But you can find all the original links to the source articles for what we're talking about
[1112.00 --> 1116.00]  in the forum thread that we link underneath.
[1116.00 --> 1119.00]  More Ryzen news while Luke works on that.
[1119.00 --> 1122.00]  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun!
[1122.00 --> 1125.00]  The original source here is overclock3d.net.
[1125.00 --> 1127.00]  Let's go ahead and pull that up and have a look at this.
[1127.00 --> 1128.00]  Whoa!
[1128.00 --> 1146.00]  AMD is rumored to have a 16 core, a 16 core Ryzen part that will reportedly run at 3.1 to 3.6 GHz max boost.
[1146.00 --> 1158.00]  I mean, cooling a 180 watt part is pretty much guaranteed to require a water cooling solution of some sort.
[1158.00 --> 1161.00]  But I think this is pretty cool.
[1161.00 --> 1169.00]  Because when AMD did this, when they pulled out like an, essentially an overclocked out of the box CPU,
[1169.00 --> 1172.00]  the 9590, that required water cooling.
[1172.00 --> 1175.00]  It shipped with a water cooler because there's no way you're going to cool that otherwise.
[1175.00 --> 1178.00]  It looked like an act of desperation.
[1178.00 --> 1184.00]  Because the stupid thing was clocked like marginally higher than the air cooled one.
[1184.00 --> 1187.00]  So you could tell they were just, they were pushing the architecture to the limit.
[1187.00 --> 1191.00]  Only because they had nothing else that could compete.
[1191.00 --> 1196.00]  Now, now that Ryzen is a thing and it doesn't suck,
[1196.00 --> 1200.00]  well now they're just pushing it to the limit because freaking YOLO man!
[1200.00 --> 1205.00]  That! That I can respect! That I'm down for!
[1205.00 --> 1210.00]  So, let's see if there's anything else that we know about it.
[1210.00 --> 1216.00]  So this blah blah blah, Ryzen engineering sample, blah blah blah blah blah.
[1216.00 --> 1220.00]  So it would offer performance similar to two R7 1700s.
[1221.00 --> 1228.00]  It's rumored to be coming on AMD's X399 socket, though that is not necessarily the final name.
[1228.00 --> 1236.00]  And the word on the street is this new socket would be aimed at high-end PC users who require a large number of strong cores for productivity.
[1236.00 --> 1240.00]  So this sounds like an enthusiast workstation.
[1240.00 --> 1244.00]  I would love for them to bring back 4x4.
[1244.00 --> 1247.00]  That would be freaking amazing.
[1247.00 --> 1249.00]  That would be very cool.
[1249.00 --> 1253.00]  Okay, so do we have any idea if this is working?
[1253.00 --> 1254.00]  Like, what are we even plugged into?
[1254.00 --> 1255.00]  Is that...
[1255.00 --> 1256.00]  Oh, okay.
[1256.00 --> 1259.00]  So I can hear me, but I don't know if I'm gonna hear them yet.
[1259.00 --> 1261.00]  That's what I'm to understand.
[1261.00 --> 1262.00]  Okay.
[1262.00 --> 1263.00]  So, you know what?
[1263.00 --> 1266.00]  I think I do know how this is supposed to work.
[1266.00 --> 1276.00]  So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna hand off this topic to you from Level 1 Text while I go get another piece that we're gonna need before our special guests can join us.
[1276.00 --> 1277.00]  Are they standing by?
[1277.00 --> 1280.00]  Okay, so I actually haven't seen...they are somewhat standing by.
[1280.00 --> 1281.00]  Yes.
[1281.00 --> 1286.00]  So I need to post this in the doc first, but this is actually super cool.
[1286.00 --> 1291.00]  So Level 1 Text, you guys know Wendel, he split off or whatever, don't worry about that stuff.
[1291.00 --> 1297.00]  But Level 1 Text has the sixth fastest...I thought it was the first for a second there.
[1297.00 --> 1303.00]  But anyways, they have the sixth fastest 1800X build overall of any GPU type.
[1303.00 --> 1307.00]  This is the fastest build that uses a single 1080 Ti.
[1307.00 --> 1308.00]  Oh, there we go.
[1308.00 --> 1309.00]  Yeah, okay.
[1309.00 --> 1310.00]  So other people have done it with like a bajillion cards.
[1310.00 --> 1313.00]  But they were mainly showing off the processor.
[1313.00 --> 1317.00]  So this is on Level 1 Text's site, if I just switch to my screen real quick.
[1317.00 --> 1318.00]  Yeah, sorry.
[1318.00 --> 1319.00]  There we go.
[1319.00 --> 1320.00]  No worries.
[1320.00 --> 1321.00]  No, it's cool.
[1321.00 --> 1325.00]  The fastest Ryzen 1800X system in the world.
[1325.00 --> 1331.00]  So that's with one GTX 1080 Ti, which I think is fair for them saying fastest Ryzen 1800X system,
[1331.00 --> 1334.00]  because their whole point is that they're talking about the processor.
[1334.00 --> 1339.00]  And the only guys that they didn't beat are guys that used many GPUs when they used one.
[1339.00 --> 1342.00]  And SLI is kind of silly dilly anyways.
[1342.00 --> 1344.00]  So who really cares?
[1344.00 --> 1347.00]  This is them showing off their scores.
[1347.00 --> 1349.00]  This is them showing off the system.
[1349.00 --> 1350.00]  What the heck?
[1350.00 --> 1352.00]  They did it with an air cooler.
[1352.00 --> 1355.00]  I did not expect that.
[1355.00 --> 1358.00]  It's an NHD 15, which is like a beast machine air cooler.
[1358.00 --> 1361.00]  But I still didn't expect it.
[1361.00 --> 1363.00]  You have got to be kidding.
[1363.00 --> 1364.00]  You can disable the...
[1364.00 --> 1365.00]  Seriously Windows?
[1365.00 --> 1366.00]  Serious?
[1366.00 --> 1369.00]  I do not have time for that right now.
[1369.00 --> 1371.00]  You can disable your Windows Update service.
[1371.00 --> 1372.00]  Okay.
[1372.00 --> 1373.00]  And cancel the shutdown.
[1373.00 --> 1374.00]  Okay.
[1374.00 --> 1375.00]  Yeah.
[1375.00 --> 1376.00]  But it's annoying.
[1376.00 --> 1381.00]  The thing is if you don't do that, it's going to be stuck on restarting for like a bajillion years.
[1381.00 --> 1384.00]  That being said, if we do the call, do you have anything to show on screen?
[1384.00 --> 1386.00]  So what, I just stopped the service?
[1386.00 --> 1387.00]  I've never actually tried to stop it.
[1387.00 --> 1389.00]  It's never been quite this inconvenient before.
[1389.00 --> 1392.00]  It might try to restart itself, so you're probably going to have to go to the Windows Update thing
[1392.00 --> 1394.00]  and turn it off through.
[1394.00 --> 1396.00]  It's just killing the service.
[1396.00 --> 1398.00]  It might restart the service.
[1398.00 --> 1401.00]  Reasons why I'm no longer using Windows 10.
[1401.00 --> 1403.00]  Reasons why I'm working on it.
[1403.00 --> 1407.00]  I said it was going to take me forever, and then people are constantly tweeting me being like,
[1407.00 --> 1409.00]  Oh, we're going to see a video about that soon?
[1409.00 --> 1414.00]  No, it's going to take me a really long time, but I do want to get my Linux slash Windows gaming rig thing up.
[1414.00 --> 1416.00]  What the actual crap?
[1416.00 --> 1417.00]  Okay, you know what?
[1417.00 --> 1419.00]  I just don't even...
[1419.00 --> 1421.00]  I just don't even...
[1421.00 --> 1422.00]  Um...
[1422.00 --> 1423.00]  Okay.
[1423.00 --> 1424.00]  So...
[1424.00 --> 1427.00]  What I believe...
[1427.00 --> 1430.00]  will happen now...
[1430.00 --> 1432.00]  is if I set...
[1432.00 --> 1433.00]  this playback device...
[1433.00 --> 1435.00]  Mine though, right?
[1435.00 --> 1436.00]  No, I don't think we can use yours.
[1436.00 --> 1437.00]  You're doing the call.
[1437.00 --> 1438.00]  Are you doing the call?
[1438.00 --> 1439.00]  Um...
[1439.00 --> 1440.00]  Okay.
[1440.00 --> 1441.00]  Hold on.
[1441.00 --> 1442.00]  Hold on.
[1442.00 --> 1443.00]  Uh...
[1443.00 --> 1444.00]  Uh...
[1444.00 --> 1445.00]  Uh...
[1445.00 --> 1446.00]  Okay.
[1446.00 --> 1447.00]  Just a sec.
[1447.00 --> 1448.00]  Uh...
[1448.00 --> 1449.00]  Oh, oh, oh.
[1449.00 --> 1450.00]  Sorry, that was probably pretty loud.
[1450.00 --> 1452.00]  I hope people heard that ding.
[1452.00 --> 1454.00]  If they heard that ding, then we're good.
[1454.00 --> 1456.00]  Did you hear the ding?
[1456.00 --> 1458.00]  Did everybody hear the ding?
[1458.00 --> 1459.00]  Do-do-do.
[1459.00 --> 1460.00]  Can you take me off the...
[1460.00 --> 1461.00]  Oh, yes I can.
[1461.00 --> 1462.00]  Yes I can.
[1462.00 --> 1463.00]  There we go.
[1463.00 --> 1464.00]  Okay.
[1464.00 --> 1466.00]  Did anybody hear the ding?
[1466.00 --> 1467.00]  Did they hear the ding?
[1467.00 --> 1468.00]  They heard the chime.
[1468.00 --> 1469.00]  They heard the chime.
[1469.00 --> 1470.00]  Okay, we're good.
[1470.00 --> 1471.00]  Okay.
[1471.00 --> 1474.00]  So, I gotta go on Hangouts and I gotta add them, right?
[1474.00 --> 1475.00]  Uh, yes.
[1475.00 --> 1476.00]  Okay.
[1476.00 --> 1477.00]  Paul is waiting.
[1477.00 --> 1478.00]  Oh, okay.
[1478.00 --> 1479.00]  Oh, oh, oh, that's a hint.
[1479.00 --> 1480.00]  That's a hint.
[1480.00 --> 1481.00]  Um...
[1481.00 --> 1482.00]  Um...
[1482.00 --> 1483.00]  I...
[1483.00 --> 1484.00]  Sorry.
[1484.00 --> 1485.00]  Uh...
[1485.00 --> 1486.00]  The one that starts with the P.
[1486.00 --> 1487.00]  Yeah.
[1487.00 --> 1488.00]  Uh...
[1488.00 --> 1489.00]  The...
[1489.00 --> 1490.00]  I'm working on it.
[1490.00 --> 1491.00]  The PP one?
[1491.00 --> 1492.00]  PP, got it.
[1492.00 --> 1493.00]  Okay.
[1493.00 --> 1494.00]  Um...
[1494.00 --> 1495.00]  You know what?
[1495.00 --> 1496.00]  Oh, you know what we should do?
[1496.00 --> 1497.00]  This.
[1497.00 --> 1498.00]  This.
[1498.00 --> 1499.00]  Oh, seriously?
[1499.00 --> 1500.00]  Seriously?
[1500.00 --> 1501.00]  I have to...
[1501.00 --> 1502.00]  Oh, oh, oh, okay.
[1502.00 --> 1503.00]  Oh, okay.
[1503.00 --> 1504.00]  Okay.
[1504.00 --> 1507.00]  I click to invite.
[1507.00 --> 1508.00]  Yes.
[1508.00 --> 1509.00]  Yes, I'm sending an invitation.
[1509.00 --> 1510.00]  Holy crap.
[1510.00 --> 1514.00]  Okay, well while I wait for him to reply to the invitation, we've actually got our sponsor
[1514.00 --> 1515.00]  spots.
[1515.00 --> 1518.00]  This might be the most disorganized WAN show we've done in quite some time.
[1518.00 --> 1519.00]  Um...
[1519.00 --> 1520.00]  Yes.
[1520.00 --> 1521.00]  All right.
[1521.00 --> 1523.00]  So, first up is Moss.
[1523.00 --> 1525.00]  Moss spring cables.
[1525.00 --> 1526.00]  Oh.
[1526.00 --> 1527.00]  Oh, wow.
[1527.00 --> 1529.00]  They have an entire, like, kit of, like, everything.
[1529.00 --> 1530.00]  Yeah.
[1530.00 --> 1531.00]  What is all this stuff?
[1531.00 --> 1533.00]  I think that bag is from them, too.
[1533.00 --> 1534.00]  What is all this stuff?
[1534.00 --> 1535.00]  So...
[1535.00 --> 1536.00]  Fridge pack.
[1536.00 --> 1537.00]  What is a fridge pack?
[1537.00 --> 1540.00]  See, I asked the exact same thing and then Colton looked at me and went, uh, this is why
[1540.00 --> 1541.00]  I'm not on WAN show.
[1541.00 --> 1543.00]  So I never actually figured that part out.
[1543.00 --> 1544.00]  Okay.
[1544.00 --> 1545.00]  Um, but I'm excited.
[1545.00 --> 1546.00]  Regardless.
[1546.00 --> 1547.00]  Okay.
[1547.00 --> 1548.00]  So this is the Moss pack.
[1548.00 --> 1549.00]  Power extended.
[1549.00 --> 1550.00]  What does this do?
[1550.00 --> 1551.00]  Uh, yeah.
[1551.00 --> 1553.00]  And that is, that is not in our notes.
[1553.00 --> 1557.00]  I'm gonna go ahead and assume that this is a battery bank backpack.
[1557.00 --> 1559.00]  Which would be...
[1559.00 --> 1563.00]  Or maybe it's just one that has, like, a spot for their stuff.
[1563.00 --> 1568.00]  I, I hate Colton with every, every ounce of my being.
[1568.00 --> 1572.00]  And that has never been more true than it is now in this moment.
[1572.00 --> 1573.00]  Never been more true.
[1573.00 --> 1574.00]  Okay.
[1574.00 --> 1575.00]  The Moss pack.
[1575.00 --> 1577.00]  And it has a, in your backpack to charge all your devices.
[1577.00 --> 1580.00]  It has a built in removable Moss reach extension cable.
[1580.00 --> 1581.00]  Okay.
[1581.00 --> 1582.00]  I found it.
[1582.00 --> 1583.00]  So that's the extension cable.
[1583.00 --> 1584.00]  Okay.
[1584.00 --> 1585.00]  So the extension cable just come, okay.
[1585.00 --> 1586.00]  So yeah.
[1586.00 --> 1587.00]  Okay.
[1587.00 --> 1588.00]  This is cool.
[1588.00 --> 1591.00]  So you undo the zipper here and you pull out the extension cable.
[1591.00 --> 1597.00]  So you plug that into the wall and then you've actually got two USBs and an AC outlet.
[1597.00 --> 1598.00]  Yeah.
[1598.00 --> 1602.00]  So if everything's plugged into this doodad, which hides in the back laptop compartment here,
[1602.00 --> 1606.00]  then boom, you just charge everything with a single cable.
[1606.00 --> 1607.00]  Okay.
[1607.00 --> 1608.00]  So that's pretty straightforward.
[1608.00 --> 1609.00]  That's neat.
[1609.00 --> 1610.00]  What else they got?
[1610.00 --> 1611.00]  They've got, uh, okay.
[1611.00 --> 1612.00]  I gotta know what the main-os are.
[1612.00 --> 1615.00]  These are fridge, fridge magnets.
[1615.00 --> 1616.00]  Can you read the notes?
[1616.00 --> 1619.00]  Oh, there are notes under the other notes.
[1619.00 --> 1621.00]  Thanks guys!
[1621.00 --> 1624.00]  Well, I figured it out.
[1624.00 --> 1625.00]  Luke helped.
[1625.00 --> 1626.00]  We got this.
[1626.00 --> 1628.00]  It includes, okay, okay, back to, okay.
[1628.00 --> 1629.00]  You know what Colton?
[1629.00 --> 1632.00]  It's a very consistent water bottle pocket that holds up to a one liter water bottle.
[1632.00 --> 1633.00]  Yep.
[1633.00 --> 1635.00]  Internal cable management straps and sleeves to keep your cables neat and tidy.
[1635.00 --> 1638.00]  Also, that water bottle thing is actually more important than you might think.
[1638.00 --> 1641.00]  Because storing water bottles in your bag while you're traveling and you have a laptop
[1641.00 --> 1644.00]  and a phone and a Switch and a Gameboy and whatever else in there.
[1644.00 --> 1645.00]  Check this out.
[1645.00 --> 1646.00]  This is from my last trip.
[1646.00 --> 1649.00]  Do you see this, um, this white mark here?
[1649.00 --> 1650.00]  Yeah.
[1650.00 --> 1652.00]  That was from the pressure of the airplane going up.
[1652.00 --> 1653.00]  Ah.
[1653.00 --> 1655.00]  Busting the seals of my water bottle.
[1655.00 --> 1656.00]  Ah.
[1656.00 --> 1657.00]  Not, not fun.
[1657.00 --> 1658.00]  So that's a thing.
[1658.00 --> 1659.00]  Yeah.
[1659.00 --> 1660.00]  Um, okay.
[1660.00 --> 1661.00]  Cool.
[1661.00 --> 1662.00]  So the backpack's pretty cool.
[1662.00 --> 1663.00]  What else they got here?
[1663.00 --> 1664.00]  So there's the, uh,
[1664.00 --> 1667.00]  There's internal cable management and stuff in there as well.
[1667.00 --> 1669.00]  This is one of their actual spring cables.
[1669.00 --> 1675.00]  They have a lifetime warranty on their cables with anodized aluminum heads with a steel spring
[1675.00 --> 1678.00]  reinforcement to prevent unwanted bending.
[1678.00 --> 1681.00]  That's right there on the end.
[1681.00 --> 1682.00]  Oh, okay.
[1682.00 --> 1683.00]  So it goes back to...
[1683.00 --> 1684.00]  So it's a tension relief.
[1684.00 --> 1685.00]  Yeah.
[1685.00 --> 1686.00]  So it doesn't break.
[1686.00 --> 1687.00]  And it also pushes itself back to where it wants to be.
[1687.00 --> 1688.00]  Oh, okay.
[1688.00 --> 1689.00]  Cool.
[1689.00 --> 1690.00]  Yeah.
[1690.00 --> 1692.00]  So these are cable organizers.
[1692.00 --> 1694.00]  So you stick them to anything.
[1694.00 --> 1695.00]  Oh, cool.
[1695.00 --> 1696.00]  And then they like...
[1696.00 --> 1697.00]  Oh, cool.
[1697.00 --> 1699.00]  When you're not using your wire, it holds it in place.
[1699.00 --> 1701.00]  That's a nifty way of doing that.
[1701.00 --> 1702.00]  I'm down with that.
[1702.00 --> 1703.00]  So that's pretty cool.
[1703.00 --> 1705.00]  And they come with little adhesive backing things.
[1705.00 --> 1709.00]  So you can use these, like, on your desk or whatever.
[1709.00 --> 1710.00]  So it comes with a pack of those.
[1710.00 --> 1713.00]  Okay, so I understand what this sponsor is now.
[1713.00 --> 1716.00]  It's like cables and, like, cable organization stuff.
[1716.00 --> 1718.00]  Okay, they've got HDMI cables.
[1718.00 --> 1721.00]  They've got, uh, lightning cables.
[1721.00 --> 1723.00]  They've got these organizer things.
[1723.00 --> 1724.00]  Neat!
[1724.00 --> 1729.00]  So you can check out Moss Products and have the same, you know, voyage of discovery that we did.
[1729.00 --> 1738.00]  They also have this, like, really nice leather phone case and wallet and ID and cash holding thing.
[1738.00 --> 1740.00]  I think that's called a phone case.
[1740.00 --> 1742.00]  But it has all the other stuff, too.
[1742.00 --> 1743.00]  That's good.
[1743.00 --> 1748.00]  So you can check them out over at mossorganizer.com slash Linus.
[1748.00 --> 1755.00]  Alright, our next sponsor is one that we are quite a bit more familiar with, given that we use these products every day
[1755.00 --> 1761.00]  and we aren't discovering that they exist for the first time right here now in this moment.
[1761.00 --> 1764.00]  iFixit, my friends.
[1764.00 --> 1771.00]  iFixit has fantastic guides and fantastic tools so that you can fix your hardware.
[1771.00 --> 1774.00]  You might say they have pro-tech tools.
[1774.00 --> 1775.00]  Yes, they have pro-tech.
[1775.00 --> 1777.00]  Yes, the pro-tech toolkit is a professional tech tool.
[1777.00 --> 1778.00]  Yeah.
[1778.00 --> 1779.00]  Thank you for that.
[1779.00 --> 1785.00]  They've got everything from their 64-bit driver kit to their suction cups for taking off displays
[1785.00 --> 1789.00]  to their spudgers for prying at things to their...
[1789.00 --> 1791.00]  Which, like, having good spudgers is underrated.
[1791.00 --> 1793.00]  Yeah, and the new ones are amazing.
[1793.00 --> 1794.00]  Yeah.
[1794.00 --> 1797.00]  And the new blue pry tools are, like, flippin' amazing as well.
[1797.00 --> 1801.00]  Those blue pry tools is probably my personal favorite improvement in the new set.
[1801.00 --> 1802.00]  Yeah.
[1802.00 --> 1808.00]  So anyway, the big news here for iFixit is not that they have great tools or great guides on their website
[1808.00 --> 1816.00]  that you can use to save yourself some money, but it's that Canadians can now get cheaper shipping on iFixit tools.
[1816.00 --> 1820.00]  They're available now through Amazon.ca, so you can go check that out.
[1820.00 --> 1825.00]  If you're not Canadian, though, you can go to iFixit.com slash Linus and use code WENCHOW at the checkout
[1825.00 --> 1830.00]  to save five bucks on a purchase of ten dollars or more.
[1830.00 --> 1832.00]  What are you doing?
[1832.00 --> 1835.00]  That...okay.
[1835.00 --> 1839.00]  So, moving away from our last sponsor spot for just a moment here.
[1839.00 --> 1844.00]  That light is Brandon's fault.
[1844.00 --> 1848.00]  I was like, I will give you a budget to buy lights.
[1848.00 --> 1850.00]  And he's like, no.
[1850.00 --> 1852.00]  Building this is better.
[1852.00 --> 1856.00]  And I'm like, do you have any idea how heavy that's gonna be?
[1856.00 --> 1857.00]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[1857.00 --> 1860.00]  Brandon, do you have any idea how heavy that is?
[1860.00 --> 1861.00]  Yeah.
[1861.00 --> 1862.00]  Brandon.
[1862.00 --> 1863.00]  Yeah.
[1863.00 --> 1865.00]  And you know how pinner Dennis is?
[1865.00 --> 1867.00]  Dennis is working out.
[1867.00 --> 1868.00]  He's bulking up.
[1868.00 --> 1870.00]  You can be working out.
[1870.00 --> 1873.00]  You can be actively working out and you can also be pinner.
[1873.00 --> 1874.00]  Fair, but he's bulking up.
[1874.00 --> 1875.00]  You have to have...
[1875.00 --> 1877.00]  He's working on it.
[1877.00 --> 1881.00]  Anyway, moving on to our last sponsor, Zotac!
[1881.00 --> 1882.00]  Zotac!
[1882.00 --> 1885.00]  Zotac, I mean, what do they not make?
[1885.00 --> 1889.00]  So, we've got a bunch of different stuff that they want us to feature here.
[1889.00 --> 1890.00]  Water.
[1890.00 --> 1891.00]  And I would appreciate that.
[1891.00 --> 1894.00]  Because I feel like they'd have really, like, modular, cool water bottles.
[1894.00 --> 1895.00]  You can go get some water.
[1895.00 --> 1897.00]  I can finish this without your interruption, I think.
[1897.00 --> 1898.00]  Just fine.
[1898.00 --> 1899.00]  Ha ha ha ha!
[1899.00 --> 1901.00]  So, they've got everything from the EN10.
[1901.00 --> 1906.00]  The EN10 series is one of the smallest VR-ready gaming mini PCs available.
[1906.00 --> 1912.00]  It's only 8.27 x 7 x 2.45 inches and can get up to a...
[1912.00 --> 1913.00]  Wow!
[1913.00 --> 1917.00]  It has a configuration available with up to a GTX 1070.
[1917.00 --> 1918.00]  And, indeed.
[1918.00 --> 1925.00]  Their VR Go is a backpack that's based on sort of the same idea of building a super compact,
[1925.00 --> 1926.00]  lightweight gaming machine.
[1926.00 --> 1930.00]  But this one goes on your back with up to two hours of playtime with two hot-swappable
[1930.00 --> 1933.00]  batteries for nearly endless VR.
[1933.00 --> 1938.00]  And so, it actually has like a third supplementary battery so that you can hot-swap them.
[1938.00 --> 1940.00]  Uh, you want me to put this down?
[1940.00 --> 1941.00]  Over there.
[1941.00 --> 1942.00]  Over there?
[1942.00 --> 1943.00]  Yeah.
[1943.00 --> 1944.00]  It's going through the mic.
[1944.00 --> 1945.00]  Oh, it's going through...oh, oh, I see.
[1945.00 --> 1946.00]  Thanks, Dom.
[1946.00 --> 1950.00]  It can be used in desktop mode with a detachable backpack strap.
[1950.00 --> 1957.00]  And, one that we actually covered very recently, freaking cool, is the GTX 1080 Mini.
[1957.00 --> 1962.00]  The world's most compact GTX 1080 at only 8.3 inches long.
[1962.00 --> 1965.00]  Now, some people were complaining about our thumbnail on that one.
[1965.00 --> 1969.00]  They were saying, you didn't cut the GTX 1080.
[1969.00 --> 1970.00]  Oh.
[1970.00 --> 1972.00]  Come on, guys!
[1972.00 --> 1974.00]  It was like a visual gag.
[1974.00 --> 1975.00]  Yeah.
[1975.00 --> 1977.00]  Like, it was in a vise, because it's being made...
[1977.00 --> 1980.00]  And I wasn't...the point wasn't that I was cutting it, even.
[1980.00 --> 1982.00]  The point was that I was, like, crunching it in.
[1982.00 --> 1983.00]  Yeah!
[1983.00 --> 1988.00]  Because I'm not going to, like, cut off part of the...like, that's not...cutting the PCB is not going to help me.
[1988.00 --> 1990.00]  Making it more compact, like they did, is.
[1990.00 --> 1992.00]  Anyway, cool card though, right?
[1992.00 --> 1993.00]  Yes, very.
[1993.00 --> 1994.00]  Okay.
[1994.00 --> 2000.00]  So, if you're looking to build the most powerful compact machine, or just buy one, Zotac is an awesome place to go.
[2000.00 --> 2002.00]  And you can check out their products on Newegg today.
[2002.00 --> 2008.00]  I'm excited for the next time that I meet up with those guys, because I know a bunch of the guys that work at Zotac, and ladies.
[2008.00 --> 2011.00]  And see what they think about the beginning.
[2011.00 --> 2015.00]  Where I roast them for, like, not giving a proper use case for it at all.
[2015.00 --> 2020.00]  And then the entire video being, like, giving it a proper use case.
[2020.00 --> 2021.00]  Yeah!
[2021.00 --> 2022.00]  I had no idea I was going to do that.
[2022.00 --> 2024.00]  That wasn't a collaborative effort with them at all.
[2024.00 --> 2025.00]  No.
[2025.00 --> 2030.00]  No, I think a lot of people assume that we're, like, you know, working with manufacturers on some things.
[2030.00 --> 2031.00]  No!
[2031.00 --> 2032.00]  But really we're working against them.
[2032.00 --> 2033.00]  Yeah!
[2033.00 --> 2034.00]  It happens.
[2034.00 --> 2035.00]  It's a giant troll.
[2035.00 --> 2036.00]  Okay.
[2036.00 --> 2037.00]  Because I love those guys.
[2037.00 --> 2040.00]  So, uh, oh, okay.
[2040.00 --> 2043.00]  I think I figured out what the issue was.
[2043.00 --> 2044.00]  It was not the headphones.
[2044.00 --> 2045.00]  Oh, no?
[2045.00 --> 2046.00]  Okay.
[2046.00 --> 2050.00]  So, I think we are ready for this video call.
[2050.00 --> 2051.00]  Is it Salta?
[2051.00 --> 2055.00]  I hope, wait, I don't see, I don't know if I see an option for video.
[2055.00 --> 2059.00]  I, okay, yeah, we're doing a thing.
[2059.00 --> 2060.00]  Oh, okay.
[2060.00 --> 2061.00]  Okay.
[2061.00 --> 2063.00]  I guess that's the video we're sending.
[2063.00 --> 2068.00]  I guess, I guess, uh, well, no, no, we should, we should see them in a moment.
[2068.00 --> 2072.00]  The Google effects and draw apps will no longer work after April 25th.
[2072.00 --> 2075.00]  You're probably going to want to maximize this or at the very least minimize what's behind it.
[2075.00 --> 2077.00]  Yes, I, I can maximize this, I hope.
[2077.00 --> 2078.00]  Oh!
[2078.00 --> 2079.00]  Oh, okay, hold on.
[2079.00 --> 2080.00]  You guys are muted.
[2080.00 --> 2081.00]  You guys are muted right now.
[2081.00 --> 2084.00]  Uh, Luke, do you want to pull the stream up just on your laptop?
[2084.00 --> 2085.00]  Sure.
[2085.00 --> 2086.00]  Okay.
[2086.00 --> 2087.00]  Okay, uh, try again.
[2087.00 --> 2088.00]  Keep talking, Paul.
[2088.00 --> 2089.00]  I can't hear them at all.
[2089.00 --> 2090.00]  You can't hear us?
[2090.00 --> 2091.00]  You can hear nothing.
[2091.00 --> 2092.00]  You can, you cannot hear us.
[2092.00 --> 2093.00]  Yeah.
[2093.00 --> 2094.00]  I think you need to enable the mic on your laptop.
[2094.00 --> 2097.00]  Yeah, yeah, I got this, I got this, I got this, uh, but if it's-
[2097.00 --> 2099.00]  None of your, none of your sound is coming through.
[2099.00 --> 2101.00]  Okay, hold on, hold on, how about now?
[2101.00 --> 2102.00]  That would be a year.
[2102.00 --> 2103.00]  Yeah, much better.
[2103.00 --> 2105.00]  You can hear us, okay, okay.
[2105.00 --> 2106.00]  Here we go, we are screen sharing.
[2106.00 --> 2109.00]  Um, have we checked Twitch chat?
[2109.00 --> 2110.00]  Can they hear them?
[2110.00 --> 2113.00]  Um, so far no one is saying that they can't.
[2113.00 --> 2115.00]  Uh, so great now.
[2115.00 --> 2116.00]  Okay.
[2116.00 --> 2122.00]  Uh, may I ask as professional video creators why it is that you guys might have opted to,
[2122.00 --> 2123.00]  um, film vertically?
[2123.00 --> 2128.00]  Uh, hangouts would not let me, uh, yeah.
[2128.00 --> 2131.00]  It's more ergonomic if you mold it this way.
[2131.00 --> 2132.00]  There we go.
[2132.00 --> 2137.00]  Okay, hold on, now I gotta, I gotta move us out of the, okay, okay.
[2137.00 --> 2142.00]  So, so, uh, we're framed in the bottom left of the frame, so if you guys could go kind of top right.
[2142.00 --> 2145.00]  That would be swell.
[2145.00 --> 2147.00]  Yeah, okay, other right, other right, other right.
[2147.00 --> 2148.00]  Right.
[2148.00 --> 2150.00]  Okay, you know what, just cover Kyle.
[2150.00 --> 2152.00]  Let's just cover Kyle, because I hate that guy.
[2152.00 --> 2153.00]  Okay, perfect.
[2153.00 --> 2154.00]  Um, okay, so.
[2154.00 --> 2155.00]  Hey man.
[2155.00 --> 2166.00]  So we have, we have a super crazy exciting announcement that we, damn it Kyle, okay, I'm gonna put us like down here.
[2166.00 --> 2167.00]  There.
[2167.00 --> 2168.00]  Yeah.
[2168.00 --> 2169.00]  Now we can see you guys.
[2169.00 --> 2170.00]  Okay.
[2170.00 --> 2173.00]  Get your shit together, Linus.
[2173.00 --> 2174.00]  Exactly.
[2174.00 --> 2176.00]  You're not doing anything.
[2176.00 --> 2177.00]  Oh.
[2177.00 --> 2178.00]  Useless.
[2178.00 --> 2179.00]  Oh.
[2179.00 --> 2180.00]  I think you're useful.
[2180.00 --> 2181.00]  Okay, but.
[2181.00 --> 2182.00]  I'm holding the front.
[2182.00 --> 2188.00]  We're gonna find out, we're gonna find out exactly how useful you guys are pretty soon.
[2188.00 --> 2191.00]  Uh, so I, I, you know what, I want, I want you guys to do it.
[2191.00 --> 2192.00]  I want you guys to do it.
[2192.00 --> 2194.00]  What, what, what's going on next week?
[2195.00 --> 2199.00]  Uh, next week, uh, we, we're gonna have.
[2199.00 --> 2201.00]  That's, well, that's part of, that's afterwards.
[2201.00 --> 2203.00]  We're gonna, uh, we're gonna be participating.
[2203.00 --> 2204.00]  Winning team on top?
[2204.00 --> 2205.00]  He's gonna be on top.
[2205.00 --> 2206.00]  He's gonna be on top.
[2206.00 --> 2207.00]  Woo!
[2207.00 --> 2208.00]  Yeah, that's right.
[2208.00 --> 2209.00]  Okay.
[2209.00 --> 2210.00]  We're going down.
[2210.00 --> 2211.00]  The, the goblin has been thrown down.
[2211.00 --> 2212.00]  Oh, we're going down, are we?
[2212.00 --> 2213.00]  Oh.
[2213.00 --> 2214.00]  Yeah.
[2214.00 --> 2222.00]  Because, because if, if, if I thought, if I thought we were going down, don't you think I
[2222.00 --> 2225.00]  might not have challenged you guys on your own turf?
[2225.00 --> 2226.00]  If I.
[2226.00 --> 2228.00]  Well, obviously you have, you have a little bit too much confidence.
[2228.00 --> 2229.00]  I think at this point.
[2229.00 --> 2231.00]  If, if I thought.
[2231.00 --> 2232.00]  If I.
[2232.00 --> 2233.00]  If I.
[2233.00 --> 2236.00]  See that right there?
[2236.00 --> 2238.00]  What, what, what is that?
[2238.00 --> 2239.00]  America?
[2239.00 --> 2240.00]  American flag?
[2240.00 --> 2241.00]  America?
[2241.00 --> 2243.00]  That's, that's the world's second tallest thermometer.
[2243.00 --> 2244.00]  Yeah.
[2244.00 --> 2245.00]  What do you guys have?
[2245.00 --> 2246.00]  What do you have?
[2246.00 --> 2247.00]  What, what do we have?
[2247.00 --> 2253.00]  Well, we, we have a country that doesn't get so hot that we're concerned about the temperature
[2253.00 --> 2254.00]  all the time.
[2254.00 --> 2255.00]  That's what we're pretty concerned.
[2255.00 --> 2256.00]  We're just.
[2256.00 --> 2257.00]  Yeah.
[2257.00 --> 2260.00]  Well that's why when we go down, when it goes down the next week, you guys are just going
[2260.00 --> 2261.00]  to burn.
[2261.00 --> 2264.00]  You know, you're going to get here and you're just going to melt under pressure.
[2264.00 --> 2265.00]  Melt under pressure.
[2265.00 --> 2268.00]  You, you, you don't even understand how melting works.
[2268.00 --> 2269.00]  Do you?
[2269.00 --> 2272.00]  Because when you apply pressure to ice, it melts.
[2272.00 --> 2273.00]  Yeah.
[2273.00 --> 2274.00]  You're right.
[2274.00 --> 2277.00]  But, but I, but I, proved Kyle's point there.
[2277.00 --> 2282.00]  I might not understand it, but I'm going to witness it next week.
[2282.00 --> 2283.00]  Wow.
[2283.00 --> 2284.00]  All right.
[2284.00 --> 2285.00]  So thanks guys.
[2285.00 --> 2288.00]  You guys are on mobile data right now, right?
[2288.00 --> 2289.00]  Yeah.
[2289.00 --> 2290.00]  It's okay though.
[2290.00 --> 2291.00]  The pulse phone, it's fine.
[2291.00 --> 2292.00]  Okay.
[2292.00 --> 2293.00]  Do we even know like what, what, what.
[2293.00 --> 2294.00]  We're getting here in the United States.
[2294.00 --> 2295.00]  Okay.
[2295.00 --> 2296.00]  All right.
[2296.00 --> 2297.00]  Okay.
[2297.00 --> 2299.00]  So, so basically here's what's going down.
[2299.00 --> 2300.00]  I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll.
[2300.00 --> 2303.00]  I'll, I'll spell this out for the audience.
[2303.00 --> 2306.00]  I'm going to, you know, kind of lay down what's going on here.
[2306.00 --> 2315.00]  Luke and I are traveling down to LA and we are going to be taking on Paul and Kyle in
[2315.00 --> 2317.00]  a two on two team battle.
[2317.00 --> 2319.00]  And this is really annoying guys.
[2319.00 --> 2320.00]  You're not funny.
[2320.00 --> 2321.00]  Um, okay.
[2321.00 --> 2322.00]  Okay.
[2322.00 --> 2328.00]  So we're going to be taking on Paul and Kyle in a two on two team battle to see who is
[2328.00 --> 2332.00]  going to be the ultimate Scrapyard War champion.
[2332.00 --> 2333.00]  That's right.
[2333.00 --> 2339.00]  My friends, we don't know exactly what the budget's going to be or exactly what the challenge
[2339.00 --> 2343.00]  is going to be, but, uh, it's going to be a thing and it's going to be crazy.
[2343.00 --> 2344.00]  All right.
[2344.00 --> 2345.00]  So, you know, I'm not sure.
[2345.00 --> 2346.00]  I'll, I'll think about it this weekend.
[2346.00 --> 2347.00]  I've been really busy.
[2347.00 --> 2348.00]  Very well planned.
[2348.00 --> 2349.00]  All right.
[2349.00 --> 2350.00]  So thanks guys.
[2350.00 --> 2354.00]  We're going to get back to the WAN show and enjoy the rest of your road trip.
[2354.00 --> 2355.00]  Yeah.
[2355.00 --> 2356.00]  Thanks everybody.
[2356.00 --> 2357.00]  Enjoy Canada.
[2357.00 --> 2358.00]  All right.
[2358.00 --> 2359.00]  Have fun in Canada.
[2359.00 --> 2360.00]  Bye.
[2360.00 --> 2361.00]  Bye guys.
[2361.00 --> 2362.00]  Bye.
[2362.00 --> 2363.00]  Okay.
[2363.00 --> 2364.00]  We can ditch these now.
[2364.00 --> 2365.00]  All right.
[2365.00 --> 2366.00]  Yeah.
[2366.00 --> 2369.00]  Let's get, let's get rid of these and, uh, okay.
[2369.00 --> 2373.00]  So yeah, we don't, we don't know the, I was actually wondering last night.
[2373.00 --> 2376.00]  I was like, huh, what are the, what are the terms?
[2376.00 --> 2377.00]  What are we actually doing this time?
[2377.00 --> 2378.00]  I have no idea.
[2378.00 --> 2379.00]  Not a clue.
[2379.00 --> 2381.00]  We're doing a team battle.
[2381.00 --> 2383.00]  That, that, that is what we're doing.
[2383.00 --> 2388.00]  And just in case you guys didn't get it from that, uh, Linus and I are on the same team.
[2388.00 --> 2389.00]  Yes.
[2389.00 --> 2390.00]  Yeah.
[2390.00 --> 2394.00]  So this will be the first time that's happened since like extremely early Channel Superfunds.
[2394.00 --> 2395.00]  Yeah.
[2395.00 --> 2401.00]  In four, in four seasons of Scrapyard Wars, Luke and I have always competed against each
[2401.00 --> 2402.00]  other.
[2402.00 --> 2403.00]  And I have always lost.
[2403.00 --> 2405.00]  So if we could win this time, that'd be pretty cool.
[2405.00 --> 2407.00]  You haven't always lost.
[2407.00 --> 2408.00]  I believe I, oh no, I didn't.
[2408.00 --> 2409.00]  That's true.
[2409.00 --> 2410.00]  You won, um.
[2410.00 --> 2411.00]  The water cooling one.
[2411.00 --> 2412.00]  The water cooling one.
[2412.00 --> 2413.00]  Yeah.
[2413.00 --> 2414.00]  Yeah.
[2414.00 --> 2415.00]  And you shouldn't have.
[2415.00 --> 2416.00]  Neither of us should have won.
[2416.00 --> 2417.00]  Everybody should have lost.
[2417.00 --> 2418.00]  Yeah.
[2418.00 --> 2419.00]  Yeah.
[2419.00 --> 2420.00]  That was terrible.
[2420.00 --> 2422.00]  I thought I, I thought I had the last one.
[2422.00 --> 2423.00]  That was really close.
[2423.00 --> 2424.00]  Was the point spread?
[2424.00 --> 2425.00]  Oh, I don't remember.
[2425.00 --> 2428.00]  It was like half a point or like one point or something like that.
[2428.00 --> 2430.00]  Like it was ridiculously close.
[2430.00 --> 2431.00]  Yeah.
[2431.00 --> 2432.00]  But, uh, but.
[2432.00 --> 2433.00]  Either way.
[2433.00 --> 2435.00]  So you haven't lost every one, but my record is still pretty good.
[2435.00 --> 2436.00]  Yes.
[2436.00 --> 2437.00]  Three and one.
[2437.00 --> 2438.00]  Yes.
[2438.00 --> 2439.00]  I'm, I'm, I'm very pleased with my record.
[2439.00 --> 2440.00]  Yeah.
[2440.00 --> 2441.00]  Here's, here's a question.
[2441.00 --> 2444.00]  How should we decide who gets who?
[2444.00 --> 2445.00]  Oh wait, no.
[2445.00 --> 2446.00]  Oh yeah.
[2446.00 --> 2447.00]  I got confused.
[2447.00 --> 2448.00]  I confused myself.
[2448.00 --> 2450.00]  Cause like when we did it with Bob and Rod.
[2450.00 --> 2451.00]  We decided later.
[2451.00 --> 2452.00]  Yeah.
[2452.00 --> 2453.00]  So no, it's you and me versus Paul.
[2453.00 --> 2454.00]  Yeah.
[2454.00 --> 2455.00]  Oh man.
[2455.00 --> 2456.00]  This is going to be crazy.
[2456.00 --> 2457.00]  It's the craziest part.
[2457.00 --> 2460.00]  I think is going to like for us at least, and this should probably translate to the show
[2460.00 --> 2462.00]  is we're not on home turf anymore.
[2462.00 --> 2465.00]  I don't like Craigslist is not a thing everywhere.
[2465.00 --> 2468.00]  It's, it's very, very much a thing down there.
[2468.00 --> 2469.00]  Eastern Canada.
[2469.00 --> 2470.00]  Not a thing though.
[2470.00 --> 2471.00]  Yeah, that's true.
[2471.00 --> 2474.00]  But like, aside from that, like up here, there's like red flag deals.
[2474.00 --> 2475.00]  Yeah.
[2475.00 --> 2476.00]  There's like freaky.
[2476.00 --> 2478.00]  And Kijiji and whatever.
[2478.00 --> 2482.00]  We have no idea exactly what we're walking into.
[2482.00 --> 2485.00]  Even just familiarity with like, when you're looking on something like Craigslist, the city
[2485.00 --> 2487.00]  name and like knowing how far away that actually is.
[2487.00 --> 2488.00]  Where is Pasadena?
[2488.00 --> 2490.00]  I don't, I've been there.
[2490.00 --> 2493.00]  I don't really know where it is in relation to things though.
[2493.00 --> 2496.00]  I was in a car and then I showed up in Pasadena.
[2496.00 --> 2497.00]  Traffic is going to be a thing.
[2497.00 --> 2498.00]  Yeah.
[2498.00 --> 2499.00]  Like we're going to be in LA.
[2499.00 --> 2501.00]  So traffic is going to be tough.
[2501.00 --> 2502.00]  Yeah.
[2502.00 --> 2505.00]  It's going to be, it's going to be, it's going to be cray cray.
[2505.00 --> 2510.00]  Anyway, that was the big news, the big news for today.
[2510.00 --> 2512.00]  We also have other news because I think.
[2512.00 --> 2514.00]  The timeline, should we give them when we're doing it?
[2514.00 --> 2515.00]  Oh yeah.
[2515.00 --> 2518.00]  It's going to be a long time until it's done.
[2518.00 --> 2519.00]  Yes.
[2519.00 --> 2521.00]  Because like editing for these things takes forever.
[2521.00 --> 2525.00]  There's so many cameras that are running a huge percentage of the time and it has to
[2525.00 --> 2528.00]  be edited like a show and each one of the episodes are super long.
[2528.00 --> 2529.00]  Yeah.
[2529.00 --> 2531.00]  We kind of sort of want to be done like kind of all of them before we launch.
[2531.00 --> 2532.00]  Yes.
[2532.00 --> 2533.00]  What's the idea?
[2533.00 --> 2534.00]  Is that Ed?
[2534.00 --> 2535.00]  No, that's Dennis.
[2535.00 --> 2536.00]  Oh, that is Ed.
[2536.00 --> 2538.00]  Hey Ed, what's the plan for the Scrapyard War season five editing?
[2538.00 --> 2539.00]  I think that was both of them.
[2539.00 --> 2540.00]  Probably next year.
[2540.00 --> 2541.00]  Okay.
[2541.00 --> 2542.00]  We'll see.
[2542.00 --> 2543.00]  Next year?
[2543.00 --> 2544.00]  A 2018 launch.
[2544.00 --> 2545.00]  A full 18 episodes.
[2545.00 --> 2546.00]  18 episodes.
[2546.00 --> 2547.00]  18 episodes.
[2547.00 --> 2548.00]  You know what?
[2548.00 --> 2549.00]  Get out of here.
[2549.00 --> 2551.00]  We're also going to have a Kickstarter.
[2551.00 --> 2552.00]  Okay.
[2552.00 --> 2553.00]  For the movie.
[2553.00 --> 2556.00]  Oh, Kickstarter for Scrapyard Wars the movie.
[2556.00 --> 2557.00]  Very nice.
[2557.00 --> 2558.00]  What would that even be?
[2558.00 --> 2562.00]  What would Scrapyard Wars, okay, bye, thank you.
[2562.00 --> 2563.00]  What would Scrapyard Wars the movie be?
[2563.00 --> 2564.00]  It has to be character progression.
[2564.00 --> 2565.00]  All right.
[2565.00 --> 2571.00]  Anyways, the editing is going to take a while, but we're filming it starting Monday.
[2571.00 --> 2572.00]  Starting Monday.
[2572.00 --> 2573.00]  Yeah.
[2573.00 --> 2577.00]  In all seriousness, Ed takes about a week to edit per episode.
[2577.00 --> 2587.00]  And what we'd really like to do is cut together the entire season at once and then find episodic splits.
[2587.00 --> 2588.00]  Yeah.
[2588.00 --> 2596.00]  So we don't end up with kind of slower episodes and then kind of like really exciting ones so we can space out the moments appropriately.
[2596.00 --> 2599.00]  It'll probably be three parts.
[2599.00 --> 2604.00]  If it ends up being completely bananas, it could be four.
[2604.00 --> 2606.00]  But probably three.
[2606.00 --> 2607.00]  Very unlikely.
[2607.00 --> 2608.00]  Yeah.
[2608.00 --> 2609.00]  Yeah.
[2609.00 --> 2612.00]  And like, just release one thing.
[2612.00 --> 2616.00]  It would end up being like three and a half hours or something stupid.
[2616.00 --> 2617.00]  No.
[2617.00 --> 2618.00]  Well, 45 minute episodes.
[2618.00 --> 2620.00]  So an hour and a half.
[2620.00 --> 2621.00]  Okay.
[2621.00 --> 2622.00]  Oh, that's right.
[2622.00 --> 2623.00]  He did really long episodes last time, didn't he?
[2623.00 --> 2628.00]  An hour and a half to two hours and 15 minutes for three episodes.
[2628.00 --> 2631.00]  So long and short of it is three hours for.
[2631.00 --> 2632.00]  That's not happening.
[2632.00 --> 2633.00]  Yeah.
[2633.00 --> 2634.00]  It's not happening for a lot of reasons.
[2634.00 --> 2638.00]  Number one is that very long format videos do not perform as well on YouTube.
[2638.00 --> 2639.00]  No.
[2639.00 --> 2644.00]  So we would be shooting ourselves in the foot for really no good reason.
[2644.00 --> 2653.00]  Number two is that Scrapyard Wars requires an entire team of us, in this case, to go travel
[2653.00 --> 2656.00]  somewhere for an entire week to film.
[2656.00 --> 2661.00]  Then it requires many weeks of our editor's time to cut it together.
[2661.00 --> 2663.00]  And float plane week.
[2663.00 --> 2664.00]  And, and.
[2664.00 --> 2665.00]  Yeah.
[2665.00 --> 2674.00]  There will be a one week early access window on Scrapyard Wars for float plane club.
[2674.00 --> 2675.00]  You ready boiler?
[2675.00 --> 2676.00]  I'm not.
[2676.00 --> 2677.00]  We'll figure it out.
[2677.00 --> 2678.00]  Yeah.
[2678.00 --> 2682.00]  So I'm, I'm pretty sure that float plane club is going to be experiencing some, some
[2682.00 --> 2687.00]  new found popularity right around the time that these start, these start coming out.
[2687.00 --> 2688.00]  Yeah.
[2688.00 --> 2690.00]  People are like, that's BS.
[2690.00 --> 2692.00]  It's like, no, objectively, that is not BS.
[2692.00 --> 2695.00]  It is objectively very expensive for us to produce.
[2695.00 --> 2699.00]  So we are getting multiple episodes out of it and that's how it's going to work.
[2699.00 --> 2701.00]  It's not like YouTube is not going to have content.
[2701.00 --> 2702.00]  Yeah.
[2702.00 --> 2703.00]  Yeah.
[2703.00 --> 2704.00]  That's right.
[2704.00 --> 2707.00]  If you didn't hear this announcement, you wouldn't even know until the first episode
[2707.00 --> 2708.00]  launched on YouTube.
[2708.00 --> 2709.00]  But you did.
[2709.00 --> 2711.00]  And then it would show up every week after that anyways.
[2711.00 --> 2712.00]  Yep.
[2712.00 --> 2714.00]  But we planted the seed.
[2714.00 --> 2715.00]  So it's there.
[2715.00 --> 2717.00]  I've planted a few seeds in my day.
[2717.00 --> 2718.00]  Minimum three.
[2718.00 --> 2720.00]  I can't anymore.
[2720.00 --> 2723.00]  But you know how it is.
[2723.00 --> 2724.00]  All right.
[2724.00 --> 2726.00]  I don't yet, but I plan to.
[2726.00 --> 2727.00]  Twitter.
[2727.00 --> 2730.00]  Original article here is from Reuters.
[2730.00 --> 2737.00]  Twitter explores a subscription based option for the first time.
[2737.00 --> 2738.00]  Wow.
[2738.00 --> 2739.00]  Wow.
[2739.00 --> 2744.00]  So they're considering whether to build a premium version of the popular TweetDeck interface
[2744.00 --> 2750.00]  aimed at professionals, raising the possibility that it could collect subscription fees from
[2750.00 --> 2753.00]  some users for the first time.
[2753.00 --> 2755.00]  Wah, wah, wah.
[2755.00 --> 2758.00]  Because even with 319 million users.
[2758.00 --> 2759.00]  Isn't that crazy?
[2759.00 --> 2760.00]  That is crazy.
[2760.00 --> 2764.00]  Twitter has failed to attract enough in advertising revenue to turn a profit.
[2764.00 --> 2768.00]  So they're now conducting a survey to assess the interest in a new, more enhanced version
[2768.00 --> 2769.00]  of TweetDeck.
[2769.00 --> 2778.00]  Personally, I might be willing to pay for team management tools, but they would have to not be trash.
[2778.00 --> 2779.00]  They would have to be really good.
[2779.00 --> 2788.00]  We tried playing around with Hootsuite and like, honestly, there was nobody in this building who was like, this is a good idea.
[2788.00 --> 2790.00]  Let's keep using this.
[2790.00 --> 2793.00]  Sorry Hootsuite, we know you're like Vancouver locals.
[2793.00 --> 2794.00]  Yeah.
[2794.00 --> 2797.00]  And all that, but we didn't like it.
[2797.00 --> 2800.00]  It might be for some teams, it's not for our team.
[2800.00 --> 2805.00]  Speaking of planting seeds, the original article here is from ctvnews.ca.
[2805.00 --> 2815.00]  Imagine a world where there could be a smartphone app that would let you test the quality of your sperm.
[2815.00 --> 2822.00]  Okay, so what we need now is like a weird social network based off of this, where you can like compete in quality against other people.
[2822.00 --> 2825.00]  So you want to gamify sperm quality.
[2825.00 --> 2832.00]  And then you can make a like Tinder style based app where it just shows a picture and a number for their quality level.
[2832.00 --> 2834.00]  Okay, so...
[2834.00 --> 2835.00]  And you can just...
[2835.00 --> 2836.00]  Taren's like, yup.
[2836.00 --> 2845.00]  So in a nutshell, there's an optical attachment that connects to a smartphone and a thankfully disposable device for loading a seat.
[2845.00 --> 2846.00]  Semen sample.
[2846.00 --> 2850.00]  The cost of the materials used to...
[2850.00 --> 2851.00]  Hold on, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[2851.00 --> 2860.00]  The smartphone based device detected abnormal semen samples based on WHO thresholds of sperm concentration and mobility with an accuracy of 98%.
[2860.00 --> 2864.00]  And the cost of the materials used to assemble it was $4.45.
[2864.00 --> 2871.00]  So basically this is like a way of bringing low cost sperm analysis to the world.
[2871.00 --> 2874.00]  And social networks based on it.
[2874.00 --> 2875.00]  Wow, no.
[2875.00 --> 2876.00]  Make it.
[2876.00 --> 2877.00]  Wow, no.
[2877.00 --> 2878.00]  Do it.
[2878.00 --> 2879.00]  Every...
[2879.00 --> 2884.00]  Hazy, teak, one of you, website idea, go for gold.
[2884.00 --> 2885.00]  All right.
[2885.00 --> 2898.00]  So if you felt like the Weasley's clock in Harry Potter was something that you needed in your life, Google has some amazing news for you.
[2898.00 --> 2899.00]  The original article here is from...
[2899.00 --> 2900.00]  Am I allowed to say this?
[2900.00 --> 2901.00]  Wow.
[2901.00 --> 2902.00]  TheHindu.com?
[2902.00 --> 2903.00]  Sure.
[2903.00 --> 2904.00]  I guess so.
[2904.00 --> 2906.00]  I thought that was like a racist thing.
[2906.00 --> 2907.00]  I don't think so.
[2907.00 --> 2908.00]  Oh, okay.
[2908.00 --> 2917.00]  I don't really know though because I'm behind the times on like politically approved terms.
[2917.00 --> 2918.00]  I never know what's...
[2918.00 --> 2920.00]  Yeah, I don't know what's politically correct or incorrect.
[2920.00 --> 2921.00]  It changes so fast.
[2921.00 --> 2922.00]  I know.
[2922.00 --> 2928.00]  Google Maps users will soon be able to broadcast their movements to friends and family.
[2928.00 --> 2937.00]  Google believes the new tool will be a more convenient way for people to let someone know where they are without having to text or call them.
[2937.00 --> 2942.00]  It could cause friction in relationships if one partner demands to know where the other one is at all times.
[2942.00 --> 2944.00]  That's when you break up with them.
[2944.00 --> 2949.00]  Or if parents insist their teenagers turn on location sharing options before they go out, that's unfortunate.
[2949.00 --> 2950.00]  They're your parents.
[2950.00 --> 2951.00]  I don't know what to say to you.
[2951.00 --> 2953.00]  I've got people saying Hindu is a religion.
[2953.00 --> 2956.00]  No, Hinduism is a religion.
[2956.00 --> 2958.00]  That's different.
[2958.00 --> 2961.00]  Apparently, Hindu is a person who follows the religion of Hinduism.
[2961.00 --> 2962.00]  Okay.
[2962.00 --> 2963.00]  I thought it was like a derogatory thing.
[2963.00 --> 2965.00]  Go show you what I know.
[2965.00 --> 2967.00]  Yeah, I didn't think so either.
[2967.00 --> 2968.00]  All I said was I don't know.
[2968.00 --> 2969.00]  PC terms change fast.
[2969.00 --> 2972.00]  But like I've never heard of it as a derogatory term.
[2972.00 --> 2974.00]  Ed is just judging you.
[2974.00 --> 2976.00]  What can I help you with, Ed?
[2976.00 --> 2978.00]  We only need you to shoot one.
[2978.00 --> 2979.00]  Okay.
[2979.00 --> 2980.00]  Me.
[2980.00 --> 2982.00]  Because Yvonne wants you to go.
[2982.00 --> 2983.00]  Okay.
[2983.00 --> 2985.00]  Dell.
[2985.00 --> 2992.00]  Dell has put their 32 inch 8K display on sale.
[2992.00 --> 2993.00]  Did I hangouts this to you?
[2993.00 --> 2995.00]  Because I was going to ask, do we have one lined up?
[2995.00 --> 2996.00]  Yes, we do.
[2996.00 --> 2997.00]  Okay, yeah.
[2997.00 --> 2998.00]  I thought so.
[2998.00 --> 3000.00]  I saw this news and I was like, we've got to have one coming.
[3000.00 --> 3008.00]  We have, we would basically get on our knees and do whatever it is Dell asked us to do to get our hands on one of these.
[3008.00 --> 3010.00]  Are we going to remake 8K gaming?
[3010.00 --> 3015.00]  Because you can do 8K gaming on one native monitor instead of splitting it across bezels and all that kind of stuff.
[3015.00 --> 3018.00]  I've actually got a few things in mind for this.
[3018.00 --> 3019.00]  Like this is a...
[3019.00 --> 3021.00]  What if you get four of them?
[3021.00 --> 3023.00]  I don't think they'll send me...
[3023.00 --> 3026.00]  I don't think there's a system on earth that could run four of them.
[3026.00 --> 3027.00]  Actually...
[3027.00 --> 3028.00]  We could make one.
[3028.00 --> 3029.00]  Okay, hold on a minute.
[3029.00 --> 3030.00]  Let me think for a second here.
[3030.00 --> 3032.00]  We would need...
[3032.00 --> 3034.00]  Okay, so basically...
[3034.00 --> 3035.00]  Okay, okay, okay.
[3035.00 --> 3036.00]  Let's back up a little bit.
[3036.00 --> 3042.00]  32 inches, 8K, now for sale, 5 grand.
[3042.00 --> 3043.00]  Don't worry about it.
[3043.00 --> 3044.00]  Oh.
[3044.00 --> 3045.00]  Yeah, that's right.
[3045.00 --> 3048.00]  To drive it, you need...
[3048.00 --> 3051.00]  I believe it's DisplayPort 1.3.
[3051.00 --> 3053.00]  So...
[3053.00 --> 3055.00]  There's that.
[3055.00 --> 3057.00]  Let me have a look here.
[3057.00 --> 3058.00]  I'm just going to...
[3058.00 --> 3059.00]  I want to double check that.
[3059.00 --> 3061.00]  So the inputs, it has two DisplayPort 1.4s.
[3061.00 --> 3064.00]  And the way you hook it up is with...
[3064.00 --> 3067.00]  That, da, da, da, da.
[3067.00 --> 3068.00]  Ba, da, ba, ba.
[3068.00 --> 3070.00]  Overall of the 8K, et cetera.
[3070.00 --> 3071.00]  How do you hook it up?
[3071.00 --> 3073.00]  Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[3073.00 --> 3074.00]  Okay.
[3074.00 --> 3076.00]  Ah, dang it, Ian.
[3076.00 --> 3078.00]  He like skimmed over it.
[3078.00 --> 3080.00]  So I can't remember exactly...
[3080.00 --> 3085.00]  Yeah, it doesn't say.
[3085.00 --> 3088.00]  Okay, I can't remember if two DisplayPort 1.3s
[3088.00 --> 3091.00]  or two DisplayPort 1.4s are required.
[3091.00 --> 3093.00]  But what I do know is that you will need...
[3093.00 --> 3096.00]  There are no consumer graphics cards right now
[3096.00 --> 3098.00]  that support either of those standards.
[3098.00 --> 3100.00]  So there's that.
[3100.00 --> 3103.00]  So you're going to need a Pascal-based Quadro.
[3103.00 --> 3104.00]  Okay.
[3104.00 --> 3105.00]  So one of those...
[3105.00 --> 3106.00]  We only need four of those.
[3106.00 --> 3107.00]  Yeah, so we only need four of those.
[3107.00 --> 3109.00]  We would basically need P6000s.
[3109.00 --> 3110.00]  Four of them.
[3110.00 --> 3111.00]  Okay.
[3111.00 --> 3113.00]  Which are like $5,000 graphics cards in their own right.
[3113.00 --> 3116.00]  And each of them would be able to drive one display.
[3116.00 --> 3121.00]  I met a guy from PNY at PAX East.
[3121.00 --> 3122.00]  So...
[3122.00 --> 3124.00]  I know people from PNY.
[3124.00 --> 3126.00]  They still won't send us anything.
[3126.00 --> 3127.00]  You guys...
[3127.00 --> 3128.00]  Ohhhh.
[3128.00 --> 3130.00]  And my system restarted.
[3130.00 --> 3131.00]  That's okay though because...
[3131.00 --> 3132.00]  We've got mine still out.
[3132.00 --> 3133.00]  We've got Luke's screen.
[3133.00 --> 3134.00]  Yeah.
[3134.00 --> 3135.00]  But that would be sick.
[3135.00 --> 3137.00]  And I feel like people should get behind that.
[3137.00 --> 3140.00]  Okay, so you think people should...
[3140.00 --> 3141.00]  What?
[3141.00 --> 3143.00]  Tell Dell and PNY to send us four each.
[3143.00 --> 3144.00]  Yes.
[3144.00 --> 3148.00]  So a $40,000 display and graphics card setup.
[3148.00 --> 3151.00]  That's literally half as much as some other videos that you've made.
[3151.00 --> 3152.00]  That's true.
[3152.00 --> 3156.00]  That is a very true thing that you said.
[3156.00 --> 3158.00]  And I will not dispute it.
[3158.00 --> 3159.00]  Okay.
[3159.00 --> 3160.00]  I think we should try to do this.
[3160.00 --> 3161.00]  That would actually be really cool.
[3161.00 --> 3162.00]  I would want to watch that.
[3162.00 --> 3166.00]  If I saw that on a title of a video, I'd be like, you know what?
[3166.00 --> 3167.00]  Yeah.
[3167.00 --> 3168.00]  I'll click on that.
[3168.00 --> 3171.00]  I'll watch this guy play like Counter Strike or something.
[3171.00 --> 3172.00]  At 16K.
[3172.00 --> 3173.00]  Yeah.
[3173.00 --> 3177.00]  Oh man.
[3177.00 --> 3181.00]  You should do a test to see like how close people have to get before they can think that
[3181.00 --> 3182.00]  they see it.
[3182.00 --> 3183.00]  Well, I've seen it.
[3183.00 --> 3184.00]  It's crazy.
[3184.00 --> 3185.00]  Yeah.
[3185.00 --> 3186.00]  Like it's bananas.
[3186.00 --> 3191.00]  They had a desktop wallpaper with like a bazillion clocks and you could like read them
[3191.00 --> 3192.00]  all.
[3192.00 --> 3193.00]  And they were all like this big.
[3193.00 --> 3195.00]  That's ridiculous.
[3195.00 --> 3196.00]  Okay.
[3196.00 --> 3198.00]  Want to move on to our next topic because I don't have a computer working?
[3198.00 --> 3199.00]  Yes.
[3199.00 --> 3204.00]  Because Windows 10.
[3204.00 --> 3207.00]  Thank you, Windows 10.
[3207.00 --> 3211.00]  I'm like dead in the water here.
[3211.00 --> 3212.00]  I mean, look at this.
[3212.00 --> 3213.00]  A lot of these are like.
[3213.00 --> 3214.00]  Look at this bull crap.
[3214.00 --> 3216.00]  It's still just getting ready.
[3216.00 --> 3222.00]  Why wasn't it getting ready before it made me not able to use my computer?
[3222.00 --> 3227.00]  Like couldn't you get ready before you interrupt my stuff?
[3227.00 --> 3232.00]  So GameStop expects the Switch to be hard to find all the way through 2017.
[3232.00 --> 3234.00]  This is an Ars Technica article.
[3234.00 --> 3236.00]  Apparently there was a GameStop sales call.
[3236.00 --> 3239.00]  So this is something that happens when you have like shareholders and stuff and you have
[3239.00 --> 3243.00]  public calls where like you talk about how well you're doing and whatnot.
[3243.00 --> 3247.00]  And they talked about the Switch launch and they were talking about different things
[3247.00 --> 3250.00]  that sold with the Switch and how much demand there is for the Switch.
[3250.00 --> 3254.00]  And if you've heard any news about that from retailers, apparently this is one of the best
[3254.00 --> 3256.00]  console launches in like a while.
[3256.00 --> 3260.00]  Like better than the Xbox's and PlayStation's console launches.
[3260.00 --> 3265.00]  Which is interesting, but I don't know if you can take it 100% because stock was out.
[3265.00 --> 3266.00]  Right.
[3266.00 --> 3268.00]  So they're getting a lot of calls being like, oh, can we get it?
[3268.00 --> 3269.00]  And they're out of stock.
[3269.00 --> 3270.00]  They're not actual sales numbers, right?
[3270.00 --> 3271.00]  Right.
[3271.00 --> 3274.00]  So, and people aren't taking unlimited pre-orders.
[3274.00 --> 3275.00]  Oh.
[3275.00 --> 3278.00]  I don't know like any store that's doing unlimited pre-orders.
[3278.00 --> 3280.00]  Just cause they're not sure when they're going to get anything.
[3280.00 --> 3281.00]  Yeah.
[3281.00 --> 3283.00]  So this seems to be a supply issue potentially rather than a demand issue.
[3283.00 --> 3284.00]  Yeah.
[3284.00 --> 3288.00]  But that being said, there is a lot of genuine interest in the Switch.
[3288.00 --> 3293.00]  And they started talking about some fairly interesting things as well in my opinion, which is like,
[3293.00 --> 3298.00]  I think the average amount of things bought along with just the Switch console was four.
[3298.00 --> 3299.00]  Really?
[3299.00 --> 3301.00]  So like people bought a lot of stuff.
[3301.00 --> 3304.00]  And surely it wasn't games because there aren't any.
[3304.00 --> 3309.00]  And there was almost a one-to-one parody between people that bought a Switch and people that bought-
[3309.00 --> 3310.00]  Breath of the Wild.
[3310.00 --> 3311.00]  Yeah.
[3311.00 --> 3312.00]  Wow.
[3312.00 --> 3316.00]  So like everyone getting the Switch is getting it for the Breath of the Wild.
[3316.00 --> 3320.00]  Yeah, that's probably a good thing because 1-2 Switch is sort of not great.
[3320.00 --> 3322.00]  I covered that in my video.
[3322.00 --> 3323.00]  Yeah.
[3323.00 --> 3324.00]  Okay.
[3324.00 --> 3328.00]  But they're expecting supply issues all the way through 2017, which is not that surprising.
[3328.00 --> 3329.00]  Where is it?
[3329.00 --> 3331.00]  This explains why our-
[3331.00 --> 3332.00]  No, it's 5.5 products.
[3332.00 --> 3336.00]  The average Switch buyer at GameStop also bought 5.5 related products.
[3336.00 --> 3337.00]  That's outstanding.
[3337.00 --> 3340.00]  Including both Switch games and accessories along with the system.
[3340.00 --> 3342.00]  They're picking up anything they can.
[3342.00 --> 3343.00]  Yeah.
[3343.00 --> 3344.00]  Yeah.
[3344.00 --> 3347.00]  Breath of the Wild was almost a one-to-one result.
[3347.00 --> 3350.00]  Every Switch customer buys a copy of that game, essentially.
[3350.00 --> 3352.00]  That's ridiculous.
[3352.00 --> 3355.00]  Well, good for Nintendo.
[3355.00 --> 3358.00]  I really wasn't sure on this one to be perfectly honest with you.
[3358.00 --> 3362.00]  I think the thing is with Nintendo you really can't be sure about like any of them.
[3362.00 --> 3363.00]  Right.
[3363.00 --> 3364.00]  And then just who knows.
[3364.00 --> 3367.00]  Because they just do weird stuff and then maybe it works and then maybe it doesn't.
[3367.00 --> 3368.00]  Yeah.
[3368.00 --> 3371.00]  And they have the money to just do that because they're Nintendo.
[3371.00 --> 3375.00]  And everyone, every time it goes bad, everyone will be like, oh my god, Nintendo's gonna go bankrupt.
[3375.00 --> 3378.00]  And they don't realize how much like insane amounts of money they have in the bank.
[3378.00 --> 3379.00]  And it's like, oh, okay.
[3379.00 --> 3380.00]  They're fine.
[3380.00 --> 3384.00]  Speaking of game companies that like don't get it, Ubisoft.
[3384.00 --> 3391.00]  So the original poster here was someone on the forum because it's not in the dock and I have it open on my phone because my computer's still restarting.
[3391.00 --> 3408.00]  But according to an article from Shacknews.com, Ubisoft came out and said, when a fan on Reddit calculated that collecting every piece of cosmetic content like outfits and emotes and for honor would cost a whopping $700,
[3408.00 --> 3415.00]  they said that we never had an intention for you to unlock everything in the game.
[3415.00 --> 3421.00]  That's so stupid.
[3421.00 --> 3424.00]  So how, yeah, I was just, you beat me to the punch.
[3424.00 --> 3427.00]  I was gonna ask, how does that make a completionist like you feel?
[3427.00 --> 3431.00]  Actually, like very specifically frustrated because you're right.
[3431.00 --> 3433.00]  That really annoys me.
[3433.00 --> 3436.00]  I've 100%ed Black Flag multiple times.
[3436.00 --> 3442.00]  And Ubisoft was already really bad for like just putting random crap all over the map and needing you to go collect it all.
[3442.00 --> 3446.00]  And then someone like me will actually go do it because they're stupid.
[3446.00 --> 3448.00]  Hold on, I've got more.
[3448.00 --> 3449.00]  I've got more for you.
[3449.00 --> 3450.00]  Oh no.
[3450.00 --> 3453.00]  For us, that doesn't really make any sense.
[3453.00 --> 3454.00]  We applied...
[3454.00 --> 3456.00]  You're gonna kill me.
[3456.00 --> 3462.00]  We applied RPG mechanics on top of a fighting game in a PvP environment.
[3462.00 --> 3463.00]  So?
[3463.00 --> 3468.00]  Let's say in World of Warcraft, you would never try to unlock everything for all the characters.
[3468.00 --> 3469.00]  So many people do!
[3469.00 --> 3470.00]  For all the characters.
[3470.00 --> 3471.00]  They're called achievement hunters.
[3471.00 --> 3472.00]  Same...
[3472.00 --> 3473.00]  Stop it!
[3473.00 --> 3474.00]  Same thing in any MOBA.
[3474.00 --> 3475.00]  There, do you feel better now?
[3475.00 --> 3476.00]  No.
[3476.00 --> 3483.00]  Oh my god, there are so many people in WoW that go for all the achievements.
[3483.00 --> 3490.00]  Loremaster is one of the most ridiculous ones where you have to complete just like all the quests everywhere.
[3490.00 --> 3492.00]  And I know people that just do that.
[3492.00 --> 3493.00]  Oh, that's fantastic.
[3493.00 --> 3498.00]  I know people that will play one expansion behind because they don't want to join like a raiding guild and stuff.
[3498.00 --> 3499.00]  Yeah.
[3499.00 --> 3502.00]  But they want to complete everything in the achievement book that they can.
[3502.00 --> 3506.00]  So when the expansion passes, some of the stuff in the achievement book goes away.
[3506.00 --> 3510.00]  And they'll try to get as much of that as they can because then you get feats of strength.
[3510.00 --> 3513.00]  Like, oh you can't do this anymore but you did in the past so it's called the feet of strength.
[3513.00 --> 3519.00]  Or you just go back to the raids and do them by yourself or the small group of people and then complete all the challenges and get those achievement points.
[3519.00 --> 3520.00]  Those people exist!
[3520.00 --> 3521.00]  There's a lot of them!
[3521.00 --> 3524.00]  Man, you're so upset.
[3524.00 --> 3525.00]  That's great.
[3525.00 --> 3526.00]  It's annoying!
[3526.00 --> 3532.00]  And like if you really, really like a game, it's fun to just like, every once in a while you just want to jump in that game and play.
[3532.00 --> 3533.00]  For whatever reason.
[3533.00 --> 3539.00]  And having a goal of like, you know what, I've beat this game before but I just want to kind of tool around and do some cool stuff.
[3539.00 --> 3541.00]  Having a bunch of stuff there is fine.
[3541.00 --> 3542.00]  That's cool.
[3542.00 --> 3547.00]  Being like, yeah, no, it's stupid and it'll cost you $700 and no one's going to complete it ever. Screw you.
[3547.00 --> 3549.00]  That's not a cool way to do things.
[3549.00 --> 3551.00]  Alright, you know what is cool though?
[3551.00 --> 3554.00]  Android, oh!
[3554.00 --> 3557.00]  A million new settings.
[3557.00 --> 3562.00]  A million new settings and an awesome snooze feature according to Ars Technica.
[3562.00 --> 3568.00]  So the developer preview is here and there's lots of new, many, many of which are boring changes.
[3568.00 --> 3571.00]  So you can do a system-wide notification snore.
[3571.00 --> 3578.00]  If you don't want to deal with a notification right now, just pull it to the side a bit to unveil a new clock icon and then it'll be snoozed for 15 minutes.
[3578.00 --> 3581.00]  You can tap on a menu to increase it to 30 minutes or an hour.
[3581.00 --> 3582.00]  Okay.
[3582.00 --> 3586.00]  The top of the notification panel has been reworked yet again.
[3586.00 --> 3589.00]  The triple function quick settings buttons are back.
[3589.00 --> 3591.00]  So tapping on the icon does one thing.
[3591.00 --> 3596.00]  Tapping on the text does a second function and long pressing the icon does a third thing.
[3596.00 --> 3598.00]  So, okay.
[3598.00 --> 3603.00]  Ambient display is a low power notification mode that kicks in when the screen is off.
[3603.00 --> 3610.00]  So when the notification comes in or when the device is moved or tapped on, the screen will light up briefly with a white-on-black UI to show you new notifications.
[3610.00 --> 3613.00]  Am I crazy balls or did that not already exist?
[3613.00 --> 3614.00]  Um.
[3614.00 --> 3617.00]  Because I even have a stock pixel.
[3617.00 --> 3620.00]  And, like, okay, tapping doesn't do anything.
[3620.00 --> 3621.00]  Moving it does.
[3621.00 --> 3623.00]  And if I get a notification.
[3623.00 --> 3624.00]  So moving it gives you that.
[3624.00 --> 3627.00]  And I guess it's slightly colored?
[3627.00 --> 3628.00]  No.
[3628.00 --> 3629.00]  No, it's black and white.
[3629.00 --> 3630.00]  Okay.
[3630.00 --> 3631.00]  It's been totally reworked.
[3631.00 --> 3637.00]  What I want to know is if they figured out why my phone gets so hot in my pocket when I'm not doing anything.
[3637.00 --> 3639.00]  And that's not in our summary here.
[3639.00 --> 3641.00]  But maybe they finally figured that out.
[3641.00 --> 3642.00]  That would be super cool.
[3642.00 --> 3644.00]  Even the Pixel does it from time to time.
[3644.00 --> 3645.00]  Yeah.
[3645.00 --> 3646.00]  Yep.
[3646.00 --> 3647.00]  Yep.
[3647.00 --> 3648.00]  I've experienced that with pretty much every Android phone.
[3648.00 --> 3650.00]  You know what Android phone doesn't do that, though?
[3650.00 --> 3651.00]  The iPhone.
[3651.00 --> 3653.00]  See, I lied.
[3653.00 --> 3656.00]  It was like I was tricking you because it's not an Android phone.
[3656.00 --> 3657.00]  Yeah.
[3657.00 --> 3658.00]  Yeah.
[3658.00 --> 3660.00]  I was expecting you to say, like, the Galaxy.
[3660.00 --> 3661.00]  A dead one.
[3661.00 --> 3662.00]  Or the Nexus S.
[3662.00 --> 3663.00]  Yeah, yeah.
[3663.00 --> 3664.00]  A dead one.
[3664.00 --> 3667.00]  It's not going to get hot if it can't.
[3667.00 --> 3668.00]  There we go.
[3668.00 --> 3671.00]  You know what kind of men don't tell stories?
[3671.00 --> 3672.00]  All right.
[3672.00 --> 3675.00]  So that's pretty much it for the WAN show.
[3675.00 --> 3677.00]  Thank you guys for tuning in.
[3677.00 --> 3678.00]  We will see you again next week.
[3678.00 --> 3680.00]  Same bat time, same bat channel.
[3680.00 --> 3682.00]  I probably won't be here, but Luke probably will.
[3682.00 --> 3683.00]  Yeah, so what's how...
[3683.00 --> 3685.00]  So yeah, I'll be back, but you're not...
[3685.00 --> 3686.00]  You will be back.
[3686.00 --> 3690.00]  So I'm actually staying down for a second collab, this time with Austin.
[3690.00 --> 3691.00]  Yeah.
[3691.00 --> 3695.00]  Austin is getting, like, petabyte project mini.
[3695.00 --> 3696.00]  Okay.
[3696.00 --> 3698.00]  And we're going to be working with him on that.
[3698.00 --> 3699.00]  How is it a petabyte project, then?
[3699.00 --> 3702.00]  Well, because it's not a petabyte, but it's a lot of storage.
[3702.00 --> 3703.00]  Okay.
[3703.00 --> 3704.00]  And it's a project.
[3704.00 --> 3706.00]  Is it half a pet?
[3706.00 --> 3708.00]  No, it's not half.
[3708.00 --> 3709.00]  Okay.
[3709.00 --> 3710.00]  Yeah, but it's a lot, though.
[3710.00 --> 3711.00]  Okay.
[3711.00 --> 3713.00]  All right, so we'll see you guys again next week.
[3713.00 --> 3714.00]  Bye.
[3714.00 --> 3715.00]  Bye.
[3715.00 --> 3716.00]  Intro.
[3716.00 --> 3717.00]  I'm out.
[3717.00 --> 3718.00]  I'm out.
[3718.00 --> 3719.00]  I'm out.
[3719.00 --> 3720.00]  No attack.
[3720.00 --> 3722.00]  What do you think the odds that Moss ever sponsored us again?
[3722.00 --> 3723.00]  We eventually got through.
[3723.00 --> 3724.00]  Did we get there?
[3724.00 --> 3725.00]  I think so.
[3725.00 --> 3742.64]  We eventually got through.
[3742.90 --> 3743.68]  Did we get there?
[3743.68 --> 3744.58]  I think so.
[3744.74 --> 3746.18]  It was a voyage of discovery.
[3748.80 --> 3749.76]  We're still alive.
