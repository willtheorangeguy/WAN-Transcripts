[8.24 → 15.18] generation it will get spicy savage jerky that's a spoiler alert, so yeah welcome to the wan show
[15.18 → 20.90] this week hosted by Riley and jams yeah never before seen unfortunately Jesus take the wheel
[20.90 → 26.18] I'm in I'm in charge of running the intro and everything first time ever in big trouble it's
[26.18 → 30.54] going to be a good show we got lots of cool news like discord launching its own game store trying to
[30.54 → 38.42] be all steamy and new leaks about the Google Pixel 3 are you as excited as last year and not only that
[38.42 → 44.98] but also be careful about what laptop chargers you use because it could destroy your laptop and also
[44.98 → 50.56] another useless augmented reality headset don't call it that roll the intro bam
[50.56 → 56.50] yeah I love this intro I hope it never goes away is it good
[56.50 → 68.12] yeah little people they represent us today little full of himself I'm short with brown hair
[68.12 → 73.16] you're tall with darker brown hair that doesn't even look like Luke savage jerky
[73.16 → 84.62] yep yeah fresh books my favourite I have what fortnight heck what the heck
[84.62 → 94.26] okay well all right we'll get there I guess download fortnight I mean don't I mean do it yes do it now
[94.26 → 100.42] get out now okay I'm only here because Lias and Luke are not available it's not because this
[100.42 → 104.44] is a permanent thing for everyone who's like ah get Riley out of there I just wanted to make that
[104.44 → 115.32] clear okay so wans ho equals jams if not Linus or Luke oh you're putting wans ho equals equation
[115.32 → 124.32] jams and Riley when Linus when not you know Luke when not equal Linus and Luke
[124.32 → 130.92] that's it yeah or there's a XOR we can use all right sure I don't know equation talk it's
[130.92 → 138.18] programming bro I'm an artsy guy I don't know about numbers I'm a psychologist damn it I died
[138.18 → 143.28] I took psychology I have a psychology I have a psychology degrees all right well let's start
[143.28 → 150.80] talking about this game stuff then psych man Mr scientist discord they got a big beta coming out
[150.80 → 158.32] part of that beta is a game store yeah this is a is a huge deal this is actually the um
[158.32 → 167.84] the thumbnail story on net linked or tech linked today represent um steam came out and was like
[167.84 → 173.40] hey we're going to copy discord's chat services they got like the chat rooms and everything in
[173.40 → 179.78] steam now so discord was like oh yeah you want to have just one product let's just be
[179.78 → 184.78] let's just make there just be one product yeah one copycat product no it's a little different
[184.78 → 190.98] because obviously I think it's a lot easier for steam to copy chat features than it is for a chat
[190.98 → 197.42] platform to copy a library because steam is like a's a giant network it's a library of games that's
[197.42 → 202.68] way harder to implement yeah I mean so okay to be fair let's like go through what is actually
[202.68 → 208.58] happening so they're rolling out this beta to 50 000 Canadian players uh they'll see oh let me stop you
[208.58 → 214.34] right there okay I had to google if these guys are if it is a Canadian company is discord Canadian
[214.34 → 219.20] I didn't look it up either I try I didn't find anything I think it would jump out if they were
[219.20 → 224.80] I'm just assuming they're American so why are they releasing the Canadian players I don't is discord
[224.80 → 228.86] Canadian does anyone in the chat I tried that I went to their Wikipedia the Wikipedia didn't even
[228.86 → 232.52] say where they're incorporated or anything anyone in the chat know if discord's Canadian
[232.52 → 240.04] I guess yeah this guy says San Francisco this guy says disco is American oh they're America
[240.04 → 246.02] so that no based in California people are saying yeah, but that doesn't mean San Francisco okay so
[246.02 → 251.20] they just like seem really they're just like oh we love Canada something technical they got all the
[251.20 → 258.00] look it's a long time coming all right we never get anything first and this is we deserve this I think
[258.00 → 262.38] yes we're so nice all the time for all the times that you watch a keynote, and they're like
[262.38 → 271.14] and we didn't stop there this is rolling out today two three states yeah oh the worst is when it
[271.14 → 277.80] goes to the UK and Australia before Canada oh we're right here it's the French that holds us back what
[277.80 → 287.06] what was that Dennis is laughing at us go away Dennis yeah Geez so I like us too Dennis I'm so famous
[287.06 → 293.02] so they're doing two things to be fair so it's like it's its a discord store where they're going to
[293.02 → 299.52] uh have curated games uh so not like you're a list of games yeah yeah it's not going to be like all the
[299.52 → 304.54] big Ea games all the big Ubisoft game it's like kind of more indie stuff like dead cells is on there i
[304.54 → 309.90] think frost punk some of those like popular games but not huge so they're going to have discord store
[309.90 → 313.32] it's supposed to be like really personalized like when you click on it there's a little description
[313.32 → 318.72] of the game that's written by a employee of discord that kind of gives their own little
[318.72 → 324.92] oh I like this game right oh it's like artisanal yes artisanal games' oh yeah that's it this was
[324.92 → 333.60] handcrafted by tiny children in Venezuela when I was just a boy I spent many hours okay there's that
[333.60 → 340.24] there's that, and then they also are adding um like a subscription game type thing like a Netflix
[340.24 → 347.24] for games type service uh to nitro which is there is already existing subscription service
[347.24 → 352.96] yeah so nitro is just basically a way for people to just support discord and like donate to them, it's
[352.96 → 357.54] kind of like Patreon you're mostly there to give them money but in exchange you get some perks like
[357.54 → 363.54] being able to have a video or GIF as your avatar and stuff like that and this new Netflix of games
[363.54 → 370.60] is just another perk really right it's a pretty BA perk though yeah I think it's not bad it's IMA
[370.60 → 384.70] uh it's IMA do you even play games IMA like MBA imbalanced imba I do play games
[384.70 → 390.48] I play games no I do but i I've never I've never encountered that before I mean I'm not like
[390.48 → 395.30] super maybe it's a RTS thing no it's a shooter am i a fool for not knowing what IMA means
[395.30 → 402.42] i know op I know nerfing IMA is like the opposite of nerfing when something's in IMA it gets
[402.42 → 408.84] nerfed its op overpowered you well okay it's more general is more yeah you're correct about that
[408.84 → 416.34] it's like Riley is a what girl what's Lima see what is IMA people I think op is more who's the
[416.34 → 423.56] gamer boy now gamer boys and girls sound off all right um one thing that they're going to have is
[423.56 → 429.88] first on discord games, so these are going to be indie games that discord helps develop they have some
[429.88 → 435.72] kind of stake in them, and then they're going to appear on the discord game store first right for 90 days
[435.72 → 439.66] usually before getting wider release to all the other platforms everything like that so that's
[439.66 → 444.92] kind of cool they're like kind of incubating some indie games that maybe wouldn't have as much of a
[444.92 → 450.56] yeah yeah an initial reach yeah it sounds like they want to they want to get some of that sweet
[450.56 → 456.94] statuesque money that game store money, but they also want to differentiate their service by you know
[456.94 → 465.28] being high touch right, right artisanal I don't know how to say it artisanal it's
[465.28 → 472.04] artisanal that sounds wrong, and it feels so good okay so they're also doing um because discord is
[472.04 → 476.00] kind of one of the things like and this is an indicator of this one of the things that discord
[476.00 → 484.48] seems to have been trying to do is kind of be the hub for like pc gamers like hey it shows what
[484.48 → 488.70] your friends are playing it has all these chat rooms that you might be interested in you can like
[488.70 → 493.02] play music on there and people know what they're what you're playing and stuff so they want to be like
[493.02 → 499.24] the one-stop shop you go to your you turn on your pc you're going to do some gaming you open discord
[499.24 → 506.10] and this thing is uh leaning towards that they're adding a universal library so they want you to
[506.10 → 511.60] launch your games through steam now even that is a crucial feature through discord not how annoying
[511.60 → 518.36] is it to have to open up epic games launcher origin steam like a different launcher battle net just to
[518.36 → 522.00] launch whatever game you want to play at that moment, so this is discord's going to have a feature
[522.00 → 527.12] where it can scan your pc if you let it detect all the games that you have installed and then you
[527.12 → 531.50] can launch them from the discord thing what it's going to do is it'll launch steam and then launch the
[531.50 → 536.08] game yeah yeah yeah but at least this is one thing to click on at least you can have your I mean I think uh
[536.08 → 542.18] the windows tries to do that with like the Xbox app I think you can do that in the Xbox app that's
[542.18 → 549.94] built in but no one wants to use that because it's Xbox so good luck discord power to you be better
[549.94 → 556.72] than Microsoft cheers cheers, cheers bud this one's for you yeah, thanks genres for posting this by the
[556.72 → 562.82] way there's the forum post don't forget all this stuff comes from the forum love you genres yeah oh
[562.82 → 568.08] also well okay I put as a sub story for that followed 76 won't be on steam but maybe that that doesn't
[568.08 → 575.98] really fit in their okay so it fits in with the what's going on with the pixel 3 leaks let me tell
[575.98 → 581.86] you about it's been ongoing yeah they've been well it's kind of like the um man it's kind of like
[581.86 → 585.96] the NVIDIA leaks right now like it's just so irritating how many of they are especially for
[585.96 → 591.52] you and me who like are going through all the tech news like we go through every tech news story
[591.52 → 597.04] basically and trying to find the ones we need to talk about and there's like Google Pixel leaks
[597.04 → 602.48] NVIDIA leaks every other story it's like stop it and the most annoying thing is knowing how they
[602.48 → 608.54] vary week to week because the nature of publishing online is like well I need to write 15 articles today
[608.54 → 615.30] so any tiny minute change in the state of things is worth a new article so even if it doesn't give
[615.30 → 619.88] you new information like let's say this week we learned there's a notch or there's a leak that
[619.88 → 624.82] there's a notch and then next week well now it's confirmed that there's a notch well we already knew
[624.82 → 630.46] there was going to be a notch, but now it's like more official man I hate the notch my first notes
[630.46 → 635.60] that I wrote in here are why is there a notch it literally says why is the notch so big that's
[635.60 → 641.16] the only that's the talking why are not just a thing i really because so we've only seen the Google
[641.16 → 646.66] pixel 3 XL so basically okay so what have we seen it's all glass there's no headphone jack two front
[646.66 → 652.72] facing cameras because of the notch obviously one front uh rear facing back camera not two like every
[652.72 → 657.12] other phone right now oh so they want bokeh on the front yeah but not on the back, and they'll just
[657.12 → 661.92] use AI on the back they also got the fingerprint reader on the back it's got 2960 x 4040 display
[661.92 → 668.92] four gigs of ram and most likely a snapdragon 845 I would hope so that's not confirmed yet um
[668.92 → 674.64] and then also in the leaks that we made do you want to bring them up do you want me to click on
[674.64 → 678.38] that well does you bring things up yeah we bring stuff up do you bring things up, so people can look at
[678.38 → 683.18] what do you want me to bring up I've never been on the article, or you posted these yeah the uh
[683.18 → 687.34] the one man boom yeah just give them a little something here it is people
[687.98 → 692.78] that's the screen we saw so for the people talking about case labs we did just see that like literally
[692.78 → 699.50] as we sat down so we don't really have any details of that, but we'll, we will talk about it uh
[700.06 → 704.06] in at some point I'm going to click through this little slideshow um
[704.06 → 711.50] well yeah someone's like no 3.5 millimetre jack and a notch count me out tell you can say you can
[711.50 → 717.10] say that again big guy good great you know I'm actually more angry I don't mind the notch I'm
[717.10 → 724.70] more angry about headphone jack and uh I see the thing is seen this is like everything that I don't
[724.70 → 731.10] want in a phone I want a headphone jack I don't want a notch do you want front firing dual stereo
[731.10 → 736.06] stereo speakers' oh yeah because that's what a lot of people say they're like I don't care about thin
[736.06 → 742.22] bezels give me speakers on the front pointing at me and I don't care about that at all I don't give
[742.22 → 749.82] a rat's Pattie about speakers on the front guys I don't have the best speakers you could ever put in a
[749.82 → 754.70] phone are still going to suck I'm using headphones I think it's obnoxious when people are in public
[754.70 → 758.54] listening to things on their phone that's very I hate it even when my wife's phone makes noise
[758.54 → 762.38] because she's watching a Snapchat or something I'm just like ah I just hate it yeah I'm never
[762.38 → 768.22] using those speakers that's true i it used to I think that was like I think one company put it on
[768.22 → 775.18] HTC I think with one of their one phones like the m6 or m7 or something had front-facing speakers
[775.82 → 779.98] and everyone was like whoa front-facing speakers are so cool blah blah so then since then people have
[779.98 → 785.34] been like oh front-facing speakers are a good thing but I've I'm with you man screw that I think it's
[785.34 → 788.78] like people like it on paper or something like that it makes them feel more techy or something i
[788.78 → 793.82] don't know I want no bezels I want the full screen now the question see I don't care about that either
[794.46 → 798.78] it just looks so much cooler I'm I'm really like I don't care what my phone looks like I'm going to slap
[798.78 → 805.26] a case on it either way so see I run nude oh really totally nude the first thing I do every time I get
[805.26 → 812.54] a phone is I buy an otter box or something spike in there I don't know I used to do that and then I would
[812.54 → 816.94] I would drop my phone tens of times a day follow my pocket when I'm on motorcycle around a concrete
[817.74 → 822.78] all the time I'm dropping it yeah that's what I do i I intentionally throw this around yes because
[822.78 → 830.38] I can exactly if you get a new phone it's gone good I just did it sweet baby Jesus I'm crazy man if you
[830.38 → 835.02] get a new phone, and you're already going to treat it nicer because it's new yeah, and you're like okay
[835.66 → 841.02] it's naked I'm just gonna I'm going to treat it good I'm going to make sure every time I reach down to my
[841.02 → 845.82] pocket that it's in the pocket before I let it go, and you're just you just get these new habits
[845.82 → 849.34] I've dropped this thing like twice and one of those times is because I was in the movie theatre and just
[849.34 → 854.54] fell out of my pocket since then I got a skin on it, it's grippier see I'm just okay this is like a
[854.54 → 860.46] discussion for another time but like what's your knowing what's the point of not putting a case on and then
[861.02 → 868.62] like I might as well put a case on and avoid a future where you know my phone cracks and I have to get
[868.62 → 873.74] another phone because I was I didn't want to spend 40 bucks it's not about the money it's the bulk
[874.30 → 877.50] it's just you don't even have to spend 40 bucks you can go to the night market and get one for like
[877.50 → 888.70] six dollars or something anyway look okay stop it don't touch me um so this one comes with well
[889.26 → 897.02] apparently the leak there's Pixel Buds an USB so that's like an appears to be a wired version USB version of
[897.02 → 901.26] the pixel like air the wireless pixel yeah that'll be interesting I wonder if they're going to be
[901.26 → 907.10] capacitive capacitive capacitive capacitive capacitive touch sensitive I want to be you
[907.10 → 911.02] know like on the Pixel Buds you can hold down on it and hail the Google Assistant with very low latency
[911.02 → 915.18] that'd be great if they had that included on these one thing that I thought was interesting is the there's
[915.18 → 923.82] a there's a d33p on the forums put a video like a new video of the pixel 3xl like just up like just
[923.82 → 928.22] now or a couple or an hour ago or something, and it shows that there's a volume rocker and a power
[928.22 → 934.06] button on the right side no buttons on the left side so I don't know what they're wasting that space
[934.62 → 939.90] maybe this is like an injury what do they have before I don't know get that pixel over here well you
[939.90 → 943.90] I'm sure you can still squeeze it right yeah they're probably going to have that squeezable that's a
[943.90 → 950.38] pretty deep notch, but you know what so is the uh iPhone 10s the iPhone 10 is a wider notch than a
[950.38 → 955.02] lot of the other Chinese phones I really hope that pixel because I need a new phone I'm still rocking
[955.02 → 961.18] a Galaxy S6 here guys and gals don't tell people that why that's been a while you do this to
[961.18 → 965.18] embarrass that's why I can throw it around also it's because it's got a case you're hoping it dies
[965.18 → 972.06] so you can justify it so I'm I'm I'm you know I wanted to get the pixel 2, but it's that you know
[972.06 → 977.26] they're releasing the new one soon so I really hope that doesn't even have a notch you see I really want
[977.26 → 983.02] a pixel three small versions the regular one, but it's probably not going to have a notch it's gonna
[983.02 → 989.18] have two front facing speakers instead of sweet bezels like the form factor of the s9 like the edge
[989.18 → 993.82] display it's very thin bezel on the top and bottom that would be great if that was just a pixel though
[993.82 → 998.54] I don't want a Samsung I don't even like I don't even like the edge anyway you know what this is not
[998.54 → 1004.14] this is not important is it we're done we're not even talking about the story any more we're just
[1004.14 → 1009.98] rambling we're just ranting okay well that was the story ranting's okay right this is the rant show
[1009.98 → 1014.94] on the last the rant show on the last one I think Luke and Linus just like ranted for like 10 minutes
[1014.94 → 1018.94] didn't they once someone came up to me at Ltd and was like you know what I like about you on the
[1018.94 → 1025.58] wans show is you keep people on task on top you're doing the opposite right well you might still be
[1025.58 → 1029.82] doing better than Linus oh that's the other thing it's got four gigs of ram and people are like four
[1029.82 → 1035.50] gigs isn't enough in 2018 for a phone yeah, but pluses have those it could be enough I have no
[1035.50 → 1040.70] idea because I have a ancient phone once again so guess what happened in the UK they changed the
[1040.70 → 1047.26] law, and it turns out people were buying internet and did you skip one I rolled down yeah I'm not
[1047.26 → 1053.02] talking about right now why not I don't want okay fine, so there was a law in the UK that if you were
[1053.02 → 1062.22] a provider of internet you could advertise speeds um that weren't realistic best possible scenario
[1062.22 → 1067.10] they were like as long as those speeds were actually deliverable to 10 of your user base you
[1067.10 → 1071.98] could advertise them so you might be able to say like 17 megabits a second but only like most people
[1071.98 → 1077.90] were getting 10, so the law changed it was involved in like a suite of laws that came into play like in
[1077.90 → 1081.90] may, but it's just I don't know some research has been done recently to see how that affected
[1081.90 → 1087.42] all the different providers there and like 12 of the biggest providers who are all just names I've
[1087.42 → 1095.42] never seen before zen internet sky plus net I know about sky john lewis broadband john lewis
[1095.42 → 1102.62] broadband so British yeah exactly subscribe now john lewis broadband is that bad is that
[1102.62 → 1109.10] racist yes no I can do British we're not this isn't our car ride home we can't talk about this
[1109.10 → 1115.26] kind of stuff yeah um so the way that the law changed was instead of it uh
[1117.18 → 1123.42] instead of the uh advertised speed only applying to at least 10 it has to be at least 50 of users
[1123.42 → 1129.34] during peak times so yeah a lot of them had to reduce their advertised speeds by like 40 or 50
[1129.90 → 1134.78] so now if it's is you advertise 17 megabits per second you have to advertise 10 or 11
[1134.78 → 1143.34] so like the speeds that they're advertising just like drop ridiculously yeah like the poster from
[1143.34 → 1152.14] last year is like all new super Lt 4 gen Barber 41 drop on average like that's what here bring the
[1152.86 → 1161.02] bring the thing up no don't they want to see this well it's not like a chart it's just like embedded in
[1161.02 → 1168.70] text i saw a screenshot of like the new is that what it is of the new um like speeds and
[1168.70 → 1173.42] they're like ridiculous it's like you sing up for our lowest tier and get like 10 megabits per second
[1174.30 → 1182.06] oh my goodness well hmm, hmm well hold on let me personally answer this uh hmm, so this is why you don't
[1182.06 → 1187.82] bring up the things I'm going to say no just because it takes less cognitive load there we go I'm okay I'm
[1187.82 → 1192.46] really sorry that I said anything see that's a big mistake this is bad this isn't even the thing
[1192.46 → 1197.18] at all you don't want to look at this here are some stock photos she's like huh is that slower or faster
[1197.18 → 1200.70] anyway the good thing about this is I hate when there are things in your life that are like
[1201.58 → 1207.42] oh yeah that's what it says but day to day you don't get those speeds like oh you're so naive you
[1207.42 → 1212.22] haven't you haven't learned the ropes that right even though it says 17 you're never going to get that no
[1212.22 → 1216.94] one gets that I hate that I hate that stuff see but like this is what I'm confused about because here in
[1216.94 → 1225.10] Canada I signed up for a 30 well now I have 80 but when I said well okay so I have 88 megabits per
[1225.10 → 1232.78] second down okay it's nothing fancy but like when I do a speed test if I don't get 76 at least I'm like
[1233.34 → 1238.46] what the heck is going on so how do these people like advertise hey you can get 50, and they're really
[1238.46 → 1244.62] getting like 12 how is that okay yes that's what because there's a little asterisk beside it that
[1244.62 → 1249.74] says like during the deadest times it's like your miles per gallon on a highway with the wind at your
[1249.74 → 1259.50] back it's like if no one else is online, and you've got a pure platinum cable yeah hard lined in you'll
[1259.50 → 1268.30] be good just the straightest cable uh is this still cable if it's not flexible I don't know I don't know
[1268.30 → 1274.70] I don't know how those I don't know technology man all right so they were all but the deal is that
[1274.70 → 1281.50] they were paying for that speed, but now they do they pay less now because no, no no well the thing is
[1281.50 → 1286.94] it's all relative anyway because it's all just based on the competition there's also different providers
[1286.94 → 1293.50] they're all probably providing the same speeds at the lowest prices they can yeah what are you laughing
[1293.50 → 1298.46] at sorry somebody said oh 80 megabits it's not 88 megabits for a second I have 80 and that's only
[1298.46 → 1302.86] after I got like an upgrade offer I had 30 before and I said 80 that's nothing fancy and then people
[1302.86 → 1307.74] were like oh nothing fancy I'm sitting here with 10 and I'm like that also sucks I'm really sorry yeah
[1307.74 → 1316.30] there's someone in Korea it's like dude e equals MC squared dude what we're flying over here yeah we don't
[1316.30 → 1322.94] even use numbers i did hear that Korea has like crazy fast internet I get 171 okay what do you want
[1322.94 → 1328.78] some money what do you want good for you yeah send some of that internet over here how about yeah what
[1328.78 → 1334.30] about us, I'm sitting with 0.05 I'm really sorry about that I want to know about this magic leap
[1335.42 → 1340.62] let me tell you about magic leap uh jams what's your name jams yeah that it is it
[1340.62 → 1348.70] little background magic leap has been teasing the sickest technology for years oh my gosh you've
[1348.70 → 1354.22] got these videos where you just put on these glasses, and suddenly you have this super high resolution
[1354.22 → 1361.02] mixed reality objects in front of you like whales splashing let us know in the chat if you saw any of
[1361.02 → 1369.34] those like concept videos uh from like 2015 and stuff uh because they were ridiculous like i there
[1369.34 → 1375.82] was the hype for this company was through the roof the investor commitment the millions of dollars they
[1375.82 → 1381.34] earned and then in the recent months they teased an actual physical implementation of like
[1381.34 → 1385.26] what these things look like they have these like steampunk look to them yeah I'm going to pull that up
[1385.26 → 1390.30] well they do still they still yeah they do still kind of look like they're like a steampunk thing
[1390.30 → 1395.98] they got the really round lenses and stuff HoloLens is like a vibe I feel like it lies to you a little
[1395.98 → 1401.42] bit less than the HoloLens in terms of physical design because HoloLens has the big visor but really all
[1401.42 → 1410.38] you can see is like this little rectangular area I mean that's technically hollow is it no but uh um
[1410.38 → 1414.14] but these at least are like okay look this is what you're going to be able to see but even
[1415.26 → 1424.06] yeah they're like that but even with this the round area is only a fraction or it's only
[1424.06 → 1428.62] a fraction of that round area that you can actually see the holograms get out of town yeah yeah get out
[1428.62 → 1433.58] it's still like a little this isn't you can, you can't see all of that it's like this little it's
[1433.58 → 1441.42] like a little rectangular area within the circular area again that's so lame um so yeah I've been
[1441.42 → 1449.90] following this since 2014. That's basically our set yeah all right they're really copying us I'm
[1449.90 → 1455.10] getting out of here 2014 was the first I looked up the old script that I did for the NCI news show
[1455.10 → 1462.14] to net linked okay I did in 2014 that was when we reported on it fall 2014 and like google put 500
[1462.14 → 1468.22] million dollars of funding into the company and then over the years they got more and more I think
[1468.22 → 1473.10] the most recent estimate like a year ago or something was 4.5 billion dollars was the
[1473.10 → 1479.82] estimated good law value of this company, so the hype was like crazy and so oh and that's the other
[1479.82 → 1486.78] thing they said they were using this like light field tech that is not just like putting light onto
[1486.78 → 1494.14] a screen they said they were going to shoot light directly into your retinas yeah yeah you saw that i
[1494.14 → 1502.14] like that you're into that the sun's doing I love that I love light field tech it's like field tech but
[1502.14 → 1508.86] light yeah but no that's not what it is they come out with if it's basically a HoloLens it's basically
[1508.86 → 1515.18] the same thing as a HoloLens they released the magic leap one creator edition it's like the developer
[1515.18 → 1523.02] version 2295 dollars uh which I think is not that far off from what the HoloLens was when they released the
[1523.02 → 1530.22] developer Google Glass was 1500 right and I think HoloLens was around there I did let me know in the
[1530.22 → 1533.58] chat if you know how much HoloLens was because I don't remember but I know it was expensive I'm not
[1533.58 → 1538.22] googling it you guys tell me we don't I haven't tried it but from the people who have tried it on
[1538.22 → 1543.58] the internet it's whack well it's not terrible that's the thing that's the thing that's disappointing
[1543.58 → 1549.42] about it like if it was like terrible it'd be like oh look at that, but it's like it's basically
[1549.42 → 1553.26] like the HoloLens like people were saying like it's maybe it's maybe a little bit better than
[1553.26 → 1560.14] the HoloLens but not much and then add on the fact that they don't even have any of like the software
[1561.18 → 1565.90] uh there for like because you know HoloLens is they're trying to integrate it into windows and
[1565.90 → 1570.78] stuff right soft is like software is their thing yeah like on day one I can take my Excel spreadsheet
[1570.78 → 1577.18] yeah with my hands like Tom Cruise yeah move it over here and the only official uh experiences
[1577.18 → 1583.10] available for this right now is I well the only ones that I found there might be more but the
[1583.10 → 1588.06] only ones that I found were like a cigars music experience type thing all right where it plays
[1588.06 → 1594.86] cigars music play that a couple of times the Icelandic band oh yeah sigaros I'm not going to pretend
[1594.86 → 1603.34] to be Icelandic but I've heard Icelandic people say it cigars cigars cigars I'm just picturing you
[1603.34 → 1608.46] like you basically have that's got to be any icelandic people say gross
[1609.02 → 1616.38] cigars you're turning into an old Italian I'm doing it no, no it's dude no I'm trying to do like
[1616.38 → 1621.42] a little bit like uh you know like uh Bjork is Bjork Icelandic yeah she kind of has the voice like
[1621.42 → 1627.50] this it's like a little elf that's kind of Dutch cigars all right anyway they have a cigars
[1627.50 → 1632.62] experience where it's like a music equalizer thing not equalizer visualizer, and then they have like
[1632.62 → 1639.18] a project create which is like it's like a's like minecraft or like these other you know those
[1639.18 → 1641.66] games that are like let you make games in the game
[1644.70 → 1646.06] dreams was one of them I think
[1649.66 → 1654.30] you can play god yeah yeah basically so they have that so you can like play around with things you can
[1654.30 → 1658.30] bake castles there's little knights that are run around you can like to make like circuits and stuff
[1658.30 → 1664.46] but like other than that what's the point what's the point you know well, and you also have to wear
[1664.46 → 1671.10] a little computer oh yeah the googles and the googles and the poodles you've got the
[1671.10 → 1676.86] googles the poodles and the canoodles, and then you're set yeah that's a hard reveal to hey when they're
[1676.86 → 1681.58] like oh yeah it's not just these giant goggles you also have to wear this soup like it's basically
[1681.58 → 1686.70] like a pg maker a discman yeah a walk mat that's the joke I made on Twitter when they
[1686.70 → 1692.46] first revealed it I made a dish you're so ahead of me yeah why don't you eat this delicious jerky
[1693.74 → 1698.30] how no you can actually open that and eat it if you really yes savage jerky I've never had this

[1720.62 → 1732.70] have here oh I think he likes it that's delicious people seem to love the sriracha bacon the maple
[1732.70 → 1737.58] buffalo bacon god they have all so many bacons and the traditional flavours one thing I'll say
[1737.58 → 1744.38] about this is that it's smoky and savoury those normally mutually exclusive stop chewing like that

[2027.66 → 2033.58] I mean it might be if your mom plays that's fine can I eat the jerky again then yes, yes you may
[2033.58 → 2039.34] it's a lot spicier than I thought it was now it wouldn't be a week of tech news without something from
[2039.34 → 2048.54] Elon Musk just right this week he may or may not have manipulated stock markets yeah uh if he goes
[2048.54 → 2055.74] to jail soon and the stock price totally tanks you'll know why so i I didn't understand this
[2055.74 → 2062.30] really so it's so he tweeted that he might take tesla private might take tesla private funding
[2062.30 → 2067.66] security is what he wrote right so wait do we need to tell people what private and public companies mean i
[2067.66 → 2072.46] I don't really understand that okay when you start a company I mean I understand that you go on the
[2072.46 → 2077.02] stock exchange basically it's like anytime anyone starts a company it's a private company it's owned
[2077.02 → 2082.54] by the people who start the company yeah and that's it when they get huge it's usually because they
[2082.54 → 2089.34] want to fundraise they make the company public which means that anyone can buy ownership of that
[2089.34 → 2096.06] company and that's what a share is so instead of me and you owning jams Riley corp suddenly thousands of
[2096.06 → 2101.50] people can own it and because they all I want to buy pieces of it you get a lot of money no I don't
[2101.50 → 2105.18] want other people to share in the special relationship you and me that's right because
[2105.18 → 2110.22] if they do then you have you're beholden to them so a public company that has shareholders they have
[2110.22 → 2114.86] to serve the shareholders are represented by the board and every week the
[2114.86 → 2118.46] board's trying to make you hit target so you can make more money for the shareholders and all these
[2118.46 → 2124.78] annoying things that are really bothering Elon Musk so he would like to take tesla back from being
[2124.78 → 2129.34] public I think it's called a leverage buyout when you were public, and then you're like no
[2129.34 → 2133.42] we're just going to buy all the shares back from everybody, and we'll be private again just like SpaceX
[2133.42 → 2139.18] is yay so what he claimed in this tweet was that hey guys I found someone with enough money
[2139.18 → 2147.02] to buy all the shares back from you at a stock like a share price of 420 and at that moment
[2147.02 → 2156.22] 420 am I right the stock price at that time was only 340 bucks so if that news was true then that
[2156.22 → 2163.10] means that the share I hold that's worth 340 is soon going to be worth 420 nice so a lot of people
[2163.10 → 2167.66] were like whoa I need to buy shares before that transaction happens because i as long as I buy
[2167.66 → 2172.46] those shares while they're worth less than 420 bucks I'm gonna profit but then once he tweets it
[2172.46 → 2181.82] the shares go up, and then it's too late so if he makes a tweet like that he has to there's the uh
[2181.82 → 2187.74] the sec which is what do they call it the securities financial the federal communications
[2187.74 → 2197.10] what FCC no the sec the securities exchange commission council triumphant uh so you're
[2197.10 → 2202.70] allowed to say that you're going to do that as long as it's true if he actually does have a backer
[2202.70 → 2207.02] that was actually going to follow through they've they've been in talks there's someone who has the
[2207.02 → 2211.50] money to do this he's allowed to share that information with shareholders he's even allowed
[2211.50 → 2215.42] to tweet about it as long as he tells the shareholders beforehand right as long as that's
[2215.42 → 2220.70] all true because if it's not true then obviously every other week Elon could be like uh yeah someone's
[2220.70 → 2225.26] going to buy it for about uh six million dollars a share and then the share goes and then the stock price
[2225.26 → 2230.54] and at that point he's just manipulating the markets yeah so after he tweeted that now there's
[2230.54 → 2237.58] an investigation uh into whether it's true, and you can tell from the stock price right now
[2238.86 → 2242.86] that there's not a lot of confidence that it is true because when you first made the tweet we went
[2242.86 → 2248.86] with 340 up to about 380 at which point my accounting friends were like boot dude you should sell right
[2248.86 → 2254.06] now if you have tesla because there's no way this is real, and it's just gonna crash and that's exactly
[2254.06 → 2259.82] what happened it went up to 380, and now it's back down to 350 because people think he's just being
[2259.82 → 2266.62] and you didn't sell well if I do have tesla stock oh you can't tell people that you stole that you
[2266.62 → 2271.82] that you sold it you can't tell people I think I can tell people that's not I don't know you're giving
[2271.82 → 2275.18] me this look like you can't tell people no you can tell people do you guys want to know I have some
[2275.18 → 2283.18] tesla stock not a lot it's just because I like tesla fancy boy ooh this is a stock market guy over here okay
[2283.18 → 2288.38] here's the thing I hated reading all the tech news about all the favourite companies, and they're
[2288.38 → 2293.34] doing cool things and the stock price is going up, and you're just not a part of it right so it makes
[2293.34 → 2297.58] everything's more fun when you're kind of just a part of it and then you just do stocks
[2297.58 → 2304.06] because you feel like you're closer to Mr musk you're kind of your role model maybe role model how
[2304.06 → 2308.94] do you think grimes feels about that I like grimes I've seen her live I support a.k.a. see partner
[2308.94 → 2315.58] what I see her live her name is she changed her name to c like the letter like the light speed
[2315.58 → 2326.54] of light constant oh yeah so always a capital okay um so do you think well I hope that uh I hope that he
[2326.54 → 2331.82] that he did let the shareholders know because if he did isn't that is it how big of a deal if it is
[2331.82 → 2338.30] they are it going to be if they find out that he did like screw up it's bad like if he just did it just
[2338.30 → 2343.98] willy-nilly yeah it's pretty bad not only is the share price the stock price will tank to sub 300
[2343.98 → 2349.18] for sure I think you can like its fraud or something like that like he might even go to
[2349.18 → 2355.98] jail Elon Musk in jail wow he'd find a way he'd find a way out yeah The Boring Company just digs him out

[2501.18 → 2502.62] good one
[2505.10 → 2509.98] I'm not good with the puns as I've just discovered after being here for some time what's
[2509.98 → 2517.42] this room thing ooh ROMs ooh I know about those yeah pull it up I'm going to put up the forum thing
[2517.42 → 2521.26] oh didn't they do something like this and brought black mirror they did with the do you watch
[2521.26 → 2526.86] black I've seen every episode I love black one where um it's Bryce Dallas howard, and she's
[2526.86 → 2531.42] it's the uh where you rate your friends on social media oh episode one of season three yeah that's
[2531.42 → 2536.30] big well or is that season four are there forcing I think that's the first one that was on Netflix
[2536.30 → 2539.58] yeah season three that's a pretty good episode they did kind of sucked there's no
[2539.58 → 2544.06] investing in people in that, but you do like kind of you have ratings, and you go up and down and stuff
[2544.06 → 2550.14] yeah, thank you to technicolor for posting this to the forum oh what the ROMs yeah I don't where
[2550.14 → 2560.14] is it I'm ROMs are ROMs over is it a Apocalypse hmm she's I don't know what you're talking about yet
[2560.14 → 2568.38] uh so do you guys know what ROMs are they can't rip you can't reply uh do you uh so ROMs are basically
[2568.38 → 2575.58] like the game file for uh games when you run in an emulator so if you're running like a game cube or a
[2575.58 → 2581.02] Wii emulator on your pc the room is what you need to load in there so you can play the game there are
[2581.02 → 2591.58] all sorts of room sites on the web, and they're in kind of like an oh that was a bad analogy to make but
[2591.58 → 2597.98] they're under fire okay all right so Nintendo just recently filed lawsuits against two huge emulator sites
[2597.98 → 2605.02] love retro and love ROMs we reported on this in tech linked um they sued them for 150 dollars
[2605.66 → 2614.94] per game 150 000 per game oh and two million dollars per trademark oh so like every
[2615.98 → 2620.62] so you like two million dollars for Zelda no smash bros counts as one covers all of them
[2621.90 → 2627.26] yeah no it doesn't that's the thing so like just a massive amount of money we're talking here to like
[2627.26 → 2632.14] independently run websites by people who are just trying to like to keep these games alive right like
[2632.14 → 2637.34] you download them for free i they get ad probably revenue from like hosting them and stuff, but they're
[2637.34 → 2641.34] making money for sure yeah they're making money on this site but like you know they're not making money
[2641.34 → 2647.66] on the games per se but anyway so you please tell me that like it's one thing to smash these people
[2647.66 → 2653.42] into oblivion and offer an alternative yeah but if you don't, it's like when they're yelling at people for
[2653.42 → 2658.70] tormenting Game of Thrones, but then there's no nice way to watch Game of Thrones HBO yeah there
[2658.70 → 2664.38] wasn't exactly for a while so you're about to tell me that Nintendo has an awesome store of classics or
[2664.38 → 2669.02] something like that well that's the thing they haven't launched the virtual so for a lot of their
[2669.02 → 2674.30] consoles in the past they launched a virtual console, and you can just go on their like for the Wii U or the
[2674.30 → 2679.58] game cube one they don't have to go to game cube but for the Wii U you go or the Wii you go on there and
[2679.58 → 2683.82] then you go to the virtual console, and you can download all of these old games and play old
[2683.82 → 2688.22] retro games on your current console, but they haven't launched that for the switch yet and there's a ton
[2688.22 → 2694.54] of things that aren't on the virtual console so that's what these room sites uh that's the that's
[2694.54 → 2701.82] the service they provide, so the big news here is that another site emu paradise for emulators
[2701.82 → 2707.42] not for emus the bird okay that would be silly yeah they just uh stopped they said they're
[2707.42 → 2712.14] going to stop hosting ROMs so I guess maybe they'll still have stuff about emulation I don't know i
[2712.14 → 2715.66] don't know whether they're still like continuing to go with just without ROMs or not, but they're
[2715.66 → 2720.86] stopping hosting ROMs because I mean they didn't say specifically that they're doing it because of
[2720.86 → 2726.46] these lawsuits but the implication shoot into oblivion the implication is that they want to avoid a similar
[2726.46 → 2733.18] fate so um, and apparently they were one of the few places on the internet that were not plagued by
[2733.82 → 2737.98] pop-ups and glitches and all this stuff because you can go and get ROMs on the internet but
[2738.86 → 2742.46] you know we can't have nice things there's no guarantee that the site that you're going to go
[2742.46 → 2747.58] to isn't just like a trap, and it's just like loading malware and stuff nothing gold can stay didn't I read
[2747.58 → 2754.46] that the virtual console on the switch is going to cost money you read that I think I read that I haven't
[2754.46 → 2760.62] seen that I scrolled past that headline oh I think it's going to cost money well I mean you buy the games okay
[2760.62 → 2766.70] I don't I didn't have a Wii or Wii U my parents had a week I actually would rather it was a
[2766.70 → 2772.30] subscription than buying the games I think hey put us in put in the chat do you know if you have to pay
[2772.30 → 2777.50] in previous consoles to access the virtual console I'm pretty sure you can, you have to buy the games on
[2777.50 → 2782.22] the virtual console okay in order to play them so that's because with old games I'd rather just try
[2782.22 → 2788.46] them all I'd rather a subscription option because like some of them might suck and want to play for like
[2788.46 → 2793.58] 20 minutes like the old games on the virtual like just old Super Nintendo games and stuff yeah see
[2793.58 → 2800.54] for me, I'm not like I didn't the first console I had was a n64 so I played very little
[2800.54 → 2808.62] of uh the n's and SNES city SNES yeah see now this is the thing they don't have the virtual console
[2808.62 → 2816.70] but they have the n's mini in the n's classic edition or whatever SNES classic edition so are they
[2816.70 → 2824.30] going to release like the n64 classic edition probably and so on, and so I want a tiny
[2824.30 → 2830.94] game cube the miniest of discs would that be okay though you know because I don't want to buy that
[2835.42 → 2839.74] why okay if they released a n64 uh mini, and it was like a little
[2839.74 → 2847.66] and I wanted to play n64 games yeah I would buy it but like most of the time I feel like a lot of
[2847.66 → 2853.10] people are running things you know they want to have it up there for as like a backup or because
[2853.10 → 2858.54] it's not available on other services so like what about old like what about Wii games that you can't
[2858.54 → 2865.74] play on switch right now you know like I don't know I think when Nintendo should have before they do
[2865.74 → 2873.74] this kind of stuff they should have some sort of service yeah, yeah well they I think if they is
[2873.74 → 2877.98] they crush these sites before the product launch then their product launch is more compelling so
[2877.98 → 2883.18] oh this is a good this is a good uh what's his name Zr gaming just said in the chat I forgot to
[2883.18 → 2890.38] mention this the n's mini the classic editions that they launched uh actually like they took some of
[2890.38 → 2897.34] them apart and one of them was actually running like hacked ROMs whatever it takes like it was
[2897.34 → 2904.54] like the Nintendo model, and it was like running an emulator and ROMs just like so it's a little
[2904.54 → 2912.62] hypocritical Nintendo huh okay so get your stuff straight let's go home what is that it yeah
[2913.58 → 2920.30] one more thing I wanted to say is room emulation morally good morally is objective morality
[2920.30 → 2930.86] a physical truth a physical truth well I found the morality here there bam well got it what
[2930.86 → 2935.58] and that's it there's no many more there's no more topics that's it that's all thanks for tuning
