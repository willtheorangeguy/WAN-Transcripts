The very next frame to the 3 EEE (which is obviously E3 as you said, since it's 3 E's) there seems to be some green artifacts as well above where the 3 E's were.  Looks like green text, but the quality is bad so I cant make it out.

2:47 speed down video to 0.25 and look at it frame by frame.
Wait, why does my timestamp link to a linustechtips video..
