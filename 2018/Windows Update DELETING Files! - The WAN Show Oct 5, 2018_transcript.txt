[0.00 --> 12.32]  are we live i think so oh hey yeah how's it going so um
[12.32 --> 25.76]  so this sucks oh yeah so a uh we actually appear to have broken 3dmark.com yeah wow
[25.76 --> 32.24]  because that is some pretty that is some pretty broke dick um page loading that they've got going
[32.24 --> 41.66]  on here yikes uh because steve from gamers nexus is live right now trying to well not trying
[41.66 --> 48.62]  successfully beating oh the record for single gpu times by extreme that we set in a video that went
[48.62 --> 55.62]  up like an hour ago where's his uh well this is all so this includes any number of gpus oh
[55.62 --> 63.80]  okay so this is obviously kingpin yeah with four graphics cards in a technically not completely
[63.80 --> 71.60]  supported scenario but like oh well for you here's a driver you can you can see there's only like a
[71.60 --> 75.34]  handful of people that are running four-way sli because it only works in benchmarks now
[75.34 --> 85.56]  um which is stupid but sure and then now steve is has apparently passed jay oh wow but not by
[85.56 --> 91.24]  much holy crap that's really close so i think that's what people are are slamming this page over
[91.24 --> 99.14]  and uh steve passing jay it is not working uh steve passing jay in sli and passing us in single gp
[99.14 --> 103.76]  and he already passed you single gp oh i'm i think so i had someone someone told me that that he already
[103.76 --> 109.46]  did but but is our video out yet oh yeah yeah our video went up like half an hour prior and then
[109.46 --> 115.34]  yeah at least the video was up first at least the video held it for a point of time we held it for
[115.34 --> 121.08]  long enough to get the video edited barely that was that was really tight like i was tempted to go
[121.08 --> 126.50]  like super stealth about it and but then i was like ah people are gonna notice on the leaderboard so i
[126.50 --> 133.34]  tweeted it yeah it's uh you know what interesting it was fun while it lasted we had a lot of i mean
[133.34 --> 139.32]  that's what this is supposed to be about because overclocking throws a bunch of salt on twitter
[139.32 --> 145.64]  now that he loses a position it's all just supposed to be about fun because overclocking has no like
[145.64 --> 153.32]  to this degree has no practical application like i will i will defend that you would never actually run a
[153.32 --> 161.06]  system sub-zero 24 7 unless you're a complete idiot and i'm allowed to say that because i have done it
[161.06 --> 172.28]  that chiller setup from our video that was my 24 7 rig back when the core 2 duo e6600 was
[172.28 --> 178.58]  the bomb dude core 2 duos were awesome so that was like over 10 years ago i actually had my whole rig
[178.58 --> 185.46]  like on a board so that i could move the chiller the reservoir and the tower in one piece whenever i
[185.46 --> 190.90]  needed to move it from place to place and i had the whole thing like insulated permanently so i
[190.90 --> 199.20]  could run that 24 7 but that's really stupid and really impractical for a lot of reasons um so so
[199.20 --> 204.96]  there's no real reason to do it other than just for the laws for bragging rights and to have some fun
[204.96 --> 215.96]  and i actually gotta say i am i am very pleased that evga and their employee vince uh remember king
[215.96 --> 222.24]  i know vince i don't know i don't remember but i'm i'm i it's it's actually kind of nice that for
[222.24 --> 228.50]  a change vince has stayed out of it for the first week or so let other people have some fun because
[228.50 --> 236.56]  i mean at some point they're gonna decide okay you know enough of gamers nexus and jay's two cents
[236.56 --> 241.42]  let's just let's just get this taken care of and then he'll put up something unbeatable and whatever
[241.42 --> 251.16]  uh but i gotta say in the spirit of of fun i'm glad that evga held the leash back for a little bit
[251.16 --> 257.40]  and uh and they've they've let the the you know the youtube community kind of have some fun with this
[257.40 --> 263.92]  i know that cool it's been the first time i think our community has had some form of competition yep in
[263.92 --> 269.42]  this way yep so that's pretty cool because the reality of it is like you can kind of you can kind of
[269.42 --> 276.34]  extrapolate um because he's done oh wait no i think this is this new i don't know if he had single
[276.34 --> 285.28]  uh rtx 2080 yet oh no he did okay but he hasn't done dual um but then if you go to number of gpus four
[285.28 --> 290.84]  obviously he's using the same oh whoops sorry i'm not screen sharing with you guys obviously vince is
[290.84 --> 297.04]  using the same cherry-picked 7980 xe on liquid nitrogen or liquid helium or whatever the crap he's using
[297.04 --> 307.08]  um wait a minute hold on this is one has he beat us no did he actually like push that number though
[307.08 --> 315.88]  i don't know interesting uh well at any rate if you go back to forex vince is already holding the
[315.88 --> 323.64]  forex record with 1080 ti's and by like a huge margin so all he needs to do is take that same cpu
[323.64 --> 332.06]  and then use whatever cooling he feels like because he's vince on 2080 ti's and then just
[332.06 --> 340.48]  completely destroy everything else with that said i don't know if 2080 ti has four-way envy link okay
[340.48 --> 350.76]  people are saying uh rip ltt to 8446 8446 what is what is our single number uh 8360 okay apparently he's
[350.76 --> 358.22]  a lot of people are saying 8446 8446 all right all right you know what we had our fun anthony and i
[358.22 --> 363.94]  spent uh actually it ended up taking a few days getting everything working because we had a variety
[363.94 --> 370.48]  of problems which even if we don't have the single single uh 2080 ti record anymore other than vince
[370.48 --> 375.32]  he doesn't count because he's vince um even if we don't have that anymore it was a total blast you
[375.32 --> 380.30]  should definitely watch the video uh many shenanigans so at one point we managed to almost
[380.30 --> 385.94]  spray the motherboard with windshield de-icer uh okay
[385.94 --> 396.26]  so you know oh geez the jank the jank is real um anyway why don't we uh why don't we get into
[396.26 --> 400.46]  some topics here and have some have some different fun let's have some land show fun yeah yeah yeah
[400.46 --> 407.46]  uh congrats to steve by the way so by beating us steve now has other than kingpin who doesn't
[407.46 --> 412.98]  count the top 2080 ti score because everything above that is titan v's which obviously people
[412.98 --> 417.94]  have had a lot more time to spend with and potentially do the kind of crazy crap that
[417.94 --> 423.04]  we've seen at professional overclocking competitions where i think the the most nutso thing i ever saw
[423.04 --> 429.48]  was a graphics card that actually had about the back third of it just hacksawed off and then
[429.48 --> 436.36]  had like this completely separate outboard power delivery module that was soldered onto the rest
[436.36 --> 444.32]  of the board and i'm just like okay i mean it was cool it was cool it was pretty cool but like didn't
[444.32 --> 449.44]  they even make those available for sale at some point i don't think so or like the backboard yes yeah
[449.44 --> 453.76]  yeah possibly but then you would have had to have the mad soldering skills not to mention the
[453.76 --> 460.12]  like the the diagram like the board layouts of these gpus in order to make any kind of practical
[460.12 --> 470.16]  use of it um so yeah okay so what do we got for topics today right the headline uh it's it's huge
[470.16 --> 476.04]  the windows 10 october update potentially deleting files that's one huge headline you know what you
[476.04 --> 482.20]  know my favorite part about this is which one before i read out that because i i saw the october
[482.20 --> 486.68]  update potentially deleting files thing before i saw it in this doc yeah before i read that i was
[486.68 --> 492.44]  prepared to come on this show this exact when show this time to tell everyone that i was probably
[492.44 --> 498.72]  going to finally give in and install windows 10 oh really i'm not making that up for like funsies
[498.72 --> 504.26]  reasons i i wanted to play the new forza so i was like oh maybe i'll just finally give up it's been
[504.26 --> 515.70]  long enough i'm sure it's gotten a lot better oh crap what we are live but unlisted on youtube
[515.70 --> 524.74]  oops uh shout out to the two viewers that was yeah massive shout out to the two people watching on
[524.74 --> 533.56]  youtube how did you find it that was that was a big mistake big problem right there uh oh crap i
[533.56 --> 537.84]  can't believe that just happened i only checked twitch i will check both i wasn't sure what the
[537.84 --> 544.28]  difference was between stream options make archive unlisted when complete and basic info privacy
[544.28 --> 552.60]  unlisted lol twitch twitch master race right now because you guys have been watching apparently one of the
[552.60 --> 560.88]  people watching is uh steve from gamers on youtube i don't know i don't know but uh oh i'm so sorry
[560.88 --> 568.36]  everyone watching on youtube because um you guys missed the first like 10 15 minutes of the show
[568.36 --> 574.70]  it'll be in the archive i i accidentally had it unlisted oh lord he's still learning how to use these things
[574.70 --> 580.40]  um so the big story is today windows 10 deleting files you want to recap what you were saying just now
[580.40 --> 585.88]  uh it's been notorious for me for a while to kind of trash on windows 10 on the show and talk about
[585.88 --> 591.34]  how i don't use windows 10 i use windows 8.1 yeah i was planning as of like sometime last weekend
[591.34 --> 596.18]  yeah that i was going to update to windows 10 because i wanted to play the new forza yeah um
[596.18 --> 600.90]  because it looks sweet it looks awesome yeah and i like just i'm not good at them at all but i like
[600.90 --> 606.88]  playing racing games every now and then um i'm so bad like i'm so bad like you played forza
[606.88 --> 613.10]  just racing games oh i'm so bad like what about mario kart did you did you see jay just like walk
[613.10 --> 619.26]  into the uh 10k gaming setup at ltx and just completely destroy everyone that's a different
[619.26 --> 625.78]  situation though still you put a you put a racing wheel if i can't feel the actual acceleration and
[625.78 --> 632.68]  braking like i'm busy staring at the speedometer and the tack and i go oh i crashed or i'm looking
[632.68 --> 638.80]  out the window and i go oh i'm going far too fast and crashed like i can't do it at all yeah
[638.80 --> 643.90]  anyway you want to play forza where you can feel it but anyways yeah for more realistic racing games
[643.90 --> 647.42]  i'm terrible at them i'm pretty good at mario kart but none of those real things wanted to play it
[647.42 --> 651.84]  anyways was like you know what i'll give up i'll finally install windows 10 i'm sure they've gotten
[651.84 --> 658.56]  a lot better uh over the last like quite a while as i've been using old operating systems um and then
[658.56 --> 663.94]  this week the week i was planning on announcing that i i read the news article that the new update
[663.94 --> 670.36]  is maybe going to just delete people's files brilliant so we'll get into that later and then
[670.36 --> 678.76]  the actual big news like with far larger implications is that china apparently infiltrated apple and amazon
[678.76 --> 687.84]  and multiple other companies with a hardware security compromise uh so we'll get into that quite a bit
[687.84 --> 695.26]  more later allegedly allegedly allegedly let's go ahead and run the intro allegedly well we're
[695.26 --> 700.64]  actually running the intro yeah allegedly i'm just being very careful on this episode
[700.64 --> 703.44]  very careful
[703.44 --> 722.66]  like just let our video go up and like let the momentum start to go down a little bit we had
[722.66 --> 730.00]  to just get right in there and crap all over it which i mean we've i don't think we're gonna take
[730.00 --> 736.24]  another run at it like realistically it's a lot it's actually a lot of work and so you know mad
[736.24 --> 743.40]  respect to the people who you know get top scores and stuff um but i think i think i think we're done
[743.40 --> 748.94]  i mean really what we wanted to do was come out of nowhere having not acknowledged what was going
[748.94 --> 756.16]  on at all and just be like womp okay bye but then we didn't have an envi link bridge so we couldn't do
[756.16 --> 762.42]  sli which is what everyone else was kind of focused on but that's probably fine anyway because we don't
[762.42 --> 769.32]  have the same godlike cpu that jay has and we only even tried one gpu yeah we were just like okay hopefully
[769.32 --> 779.26]  this one's pretty deece here we go um yeah so we got we got lucky we got lucky all right speaking of
[779.26 --> 785.40]  getting lucky why don't we just open with this so it was posted by spartaman64 on the forum the original
[785.40 --> 798.56]  article here is from bloomberg and there is a fair bit of kind of um uncorroborated information in this
[798.56 --> 804.52]  article what's up that people are yelling that there's a bloomberg thing that there's a bloomberg
[804.52 --> 811.56]  thing or sorry that there's a super chat oh there's a super chat oh fake news on the bloomberg article
[811.56 --> 818.06]  yeah we are gonna talk about that yeah oh boy i think that's the one they're actually talking about
[818.06 --> 825.56]  okay so um we know we know there's there's some weird stuff in the bloomberg article we'll talk about
[825.56 --> 834.16]  that later we'll talk about we'll talk about that um gamers nexus just sent us a super chat
[834.16 --> 841.84]  when and you know the funny thing about this is like we were just trying to be nice you know
[841.84 --> 849.28]  by by beating all we were just trying to no no we bring more attention to no we no we we sent them a
[849.28 --> 855.82]  super chat oh during their live stream yeah yeah so we were just trying to be nice i mean the fact
[855.82 --> 865.02]  that it was 84 and 46 cents which happens to be the single gpu score oh that knocked them out
[865.02 --> 874.06]  is a coincidence and there's really no reason for steve to get all salty about it and like return the
[874.06 --> 880.16]  money because i mean really really it was it wasn't about like you know getting attention over
[880.16 --> 885.80]  on his live stream or whatever this was about wanting to be supportive of his efforts i mean you
[885.80 --> 892.36]  can you can you know you can break a lot of hardware you know treating it the way that he is right now
[892.36 --> 899.58]  so it's it's just we we care about the hardware more yeah yeah exactly exactly yeah we still want to
[899.58 --> 904.50]  break things yeah and we have a lot of respect for steve which is why we wanted to support him
[904.50 --> 910.56]  and the valuable work that he does yeah with our 84 and 46 cents donate to gamers nexus today yeah
[910.56 --> 917.64]  all right anyway they don't need our charity but they might need you yeah they might need yours
[917.64 --> 925.76]  oops okay so let's go ahead and let's let's run through this here shall we so a bloomberg report
[925.76 --> 931.06]  claims claims claims allegedly allegedly that china spies have carried out the most significant
[931.06 --> 936.28]  supply chain attack ever known against american companies and what they mean by a supply chain
[936.28 --> 946.30]  attack is that instead of trying to um to steal data by intercepting network traffic or by um gaining
[946.30 --> 952.74]  physical access to a server that is already configured and already running uh and then and then steal the
[952.74 --> 961.30]  data that way a supply chain attack would have the attacker actually hijack the shipment physically
[961.30 --> 967.74]  oftentimes between two parties neither of which are aware of what's going on yeah make some kind of
[967.74 --> 975.04]  change and then forward it again without either party becoming aware of what's going on so here's
[975.04 --> 982.56]  the story allegedly according to the bloomberg report so in 2015 amazon began evaluating american
[982.56 --> 988.58]  startup called elemental technologies yada yada yada that became amazon prime video so as part of
[988.58 --> 993.72]  their due diligence amazon hired a third-party company to scrutinize their security elemental was
[993.72 --> 999.24]  apparently using allegedly servers assembled by supermicro so we're familiar with supermicro we've
[999.24 --> 1005.06]  used a fair bit of supermicro's gear ourselves including our main file storage server um i think
[1005.06 --> 1010.58]  they're also pretty well known overall yeah so they were sent to ontario for testing the testers found a
[1010.58 --> 1014.52]  tiny microchip about the size of a grain of rice that wasn't part of the board's original design
[1014.52 --> 1021.96]  the chip apparently allegedly incorporated memory networking capability and sufficient processing power
[1021.96 --> 1029.02]  for an attack so allegedly when the server was installed and switched on the microchip could alter
[1029.02 --> 1033.78]  the operating system's core so it could accept modifications and the chip could contact computers
[1033.78 --> 1039.16]  controlled by the attackers for further instructions and code so the primary role of an implant like this
[1039.16 --> 1044.96]  would be to open doors that other attackers can go through depending on the board model allegedly
[1044.96 --> 1049.40]  the chips varied slightly in size suggesting that the attackers had supplied different factories with
[1049.40 --> 1055.02]  different batches amazon allegedly reported the discovery to the u.s authorities at this time
[1055.02 --> 1060.42]  allegedly and at this time as well elemental servers could be found in department of defense data
[1060.42 --> 1066.42]  centers the cia's drone operations and the onboard networks of navy warships but elemental was just one of
[1066.42 --> 1076.08]  hundreds of super micro customers so the uh allegedly ensuing top secret probe remains open today more
[1076.08 --> 1080.82]  than three years later with investigators determining that the chips allowed attackers to create a stealth
[1080.82 --> 1086.38]  doorway into any network that included the altered machines now allegedly a lot of these things
[1086.38 --> 1098.84]  don't initially necessarily pass a sniff test here even even like for not super technical people yeah like here can i give my my idiot
[1098.84 --> 1103.92]  version of why a lot of this doesn't make a ton of sense okay and then i'll let you go sure okay
[1103.92 --> 1112.58]  so a chip on a motherboard unless you're running your router with like um what's it called the auto configuring
[1112.58 --> 1121.28]  stupid thing yeah wps w w no um man that's the auto connecting thing if that's what you're talking about
[1121.28 --> 1122.46]  yeah no not that one
[1122.46 --> 1130.82]  what's it called uh upnp okay yeah unless you're running a router with upnp
[1130.82 --> 1138.78]  to my knowledge there is no way that a machine on the network can reconfigure the ports
[1138.78 --> 1142.52]  that your network has open and how they're forwarded
[1142.52 --> 1148.50]  so there's there's even more stuff than just that okay but that's just that's just the first thing
[1148.50 --> 1155.52]  yeah so one thing i noticed but wasn't good enough with electronics to really yeah dive further into
[1155.52 --> 1161.02]  but then was super happy that wendell started talking about it on twitter yeah was that like a chip
[1161.02 --> 1167.86]  of literally that size and that in that place those connections yeah it would have to be like a two to
[1167.86 --> 1174.00]  four pin chip right like what is it doing yeah what can you do with two pins so and people started
[1174.00 --> 1179.22]  diving more into that but it's like it's already weird just at that level yeah and like this is way
[1179.22 --> 1183.72]  beyond me so i don't know but the first hardware thing that stood out to me and we should go ahead
[1183.72 --> 1188.26]  and we should pop this uh this article open here again and one thing i want to add is that people
[1188.26 --> 1193.84]  far better at this stuff than linus and i are noticing these things yeah so so this was the first
[1193.84 --> 1198.76]  thing that popped out to me here's the board and you can see they're kind of stripping off components
[1198.76 --> 1205.92]  as we go here and here's the chip so i just i'm gonna i'm gonna print screen this real real quick
[1205.92 --> 1220.86]  here there we go uh mspaint mspaint saves the day okay can we not shrink this really really oh paint
[1220.86 --> 1229.24]  can you just why why why okay resize here we go percentage uh i don't i don't know 40 percent
[1229.24 --> 1238.08]  there we go good enough all right so here's the issue so this uh this is a type of motherboard that
[1238.08 --> 1243.10]  is pretty typical and what are they called blade servers yeah so this is where you basically are just
[1243.10 --> 1250.36]  sliding an entire computer into a small bay in a larger chassis that would contain multiple computers
[1250.36 --> 1257.32]  so this is really high density high density stuff here all right so the location was like somewhere
[1257.32 --> 1266.28]  around here and the bloomberg article reports that it was able to get memory information i'm kind of
[1266.28 --> 1276.70]  sitting here going how because this is your main motherboard chipset as far as i can tell and this
[1276.70 --> 1283.20]  they've actually they seem to have blanked out yeah some of the details on this but this isn't much
[1283.20 --> 1291.62]  and i don't know the most about pcb layout and board design for sure yeah but what i do know is that
[1291.62 --> 1299.92]  you don't go out of your way to run traces like this well definitely not on a curve but like yeah you
[1299.92 --> 1303.88]  don't want to run them far definitely you don't want to run them any further than you have to except in
[1303.88 --> 1310.76]  very specific instances like for example memory high speed memory can benefit from little zigzags
[1310.76 --> 1316.34]  so you'll see little zigzags in some traces and then you'll see straight uh straight traces running
[1316.34 --> 1324.50]  to other places so for example let's say this is a cpu and this is the like you know four dim slots
[1324.50 --> 1329.96]  next to it so in some can you hold this for me please sure thank you sir so in some cases you might see
[1329.96 --> 1337.04]  straight traces going out to the extremities and then you might see zigzag traces going here and
[1337.04 --> 1341.88]  that's because when you're going real real fast i'm good when you're going real real fast it can
[1341.88 --> 1348.38]  actually the difference in the arrival timing of the electrons can make a difference on that scale
[1348.38 --> 1355.00]  so anyway but for something where you're transferring i wasn't fully listening to what you're saying because i was
[1355.00 --> 1360.02]  reading chat but aj saying no it's to match the length of the lengths of the traces i know i just
[1360.02 --> 1367.64]  said that oh i don't know it's just trying to put his input in there oh okay that was the okay okay if
[1367.64 --> 1372.08]  it wasn't clear then it's really important that that's clear the reason that they're zigzagging here
[1372.08 --> 1376.42]  is because that's a shorter distance and the reason that they're not zigzagging at the extremities
[1376.42 --> 1381.50]  is because that's a longer distance so you got a zigzag here so that the traces are all the same length
[1381.50 --> 1390.30]  so that the timing doesn't get bunged up all right so anyway that chip in order to have access to
[1390.30 --> 1396.52]  memory what was it memory networking and what what else allegedly was it did it have access to here
[1396.52 --> 1405.60]  hold on let me go let me go back to our notes um doorway into network etc etc uh what's that uh
[1405.60 --> 1412.62]  i don't necessarily want to say it hold on ah interesting answer phone everyone's spamming that
[1412.62 --> 1415.68]  oh i had my phone on silent
[1415.68 --> 1421.82]  what do you want
[1421.82 --> 1428.68]  so first of all i have you on speaker don't say anything uh but you don't want to reflect poorly
[1428.68 --> 1433.32]  on your image i i don't think anything that i do could reflect poorly on my image
[1433.32 --> 1439.16]  i think people are kind of used to my nonsense at this point what can i do for you
[1439.16 --> 1446.74]  uh this is fine because uh our chat said that you uh you read our message and i wanted to make sure
[1446.74 --> 1454.86]  you know it wasn't just oh oh no my feelings are super hurt actually so you know you know that uh you
[1454.86 --> 1460.34]  know that event that um that you went ahead and attended last year where we kind of like
[1460.34 --> 1466.24]  buried the hatchet and stuff like you were you were there for that right because i had really
[1466.24 --> 1470.58]  understood that the hatchet was buried and now it really feel it feels like the hatchet has been
[1470.58 --> 1478.98]  pulled out but like not out of the stump you know not not not out of the stump look steve i never
[1478.98 --> 1487.38]  pull out okay that's why i got a vasectomy okay so look it feels like the hatchet that you pulled
[1487.38 --> 1493.64]  out was not in a stump but actually in my chest and i'm bleeding right now steve i'm bleeding
[1493.64 --> 1501.62]  i'm so sorry lion uh is there anything i can do to make it to stop the bleeding
[1501.62 --> 1512.48]  you know what just just just just don't show up at ltx next year oh just don't show up even though
[1512.48 --> 1518.32]  and then you know what this is breaking news breaking news actually we had a great chat with uh we're not
[1518.32 --> 1524.76]  going to name any names but we had a great chat with an unnamed large land party organizer
[1524.76 --> 1536.64]  and it looks like don't name them and it looks like ltx had somewhat confirmed next year is going to be
[1536.64 --> 1545.94]  more than double the footprint with a byoc lan that is going to have capacity for hundreds of gamers
[1545.94 --> 1551.98]  oh my god that is actually amazing and by the way steve i'm totally joking you have to be there it's
[1551.98 --> 1558.28]  gonna it's gonna rock and of course i'm just messing with you uh thank you for uh thank you for thank
[1558.28 --> 1563.78]  you for being uh hilarious in all this should consider doing yeah thanks for keeping it going i think it
[1563.78 --> 1567.88]  was good for the community and you were streaming so you missed it but i actually just pre-called
[1567.88 --> 1573.04]  like the hell out of ltx so i'm glad to hear you're joking because i'd have to take all that
[1573.04 --> 1578.76]  oh yeah no way man it's gonna be so much better next year we are really looking forward to it and
[1578.76 --> 1583.98]  i mean i just just so everyone knows like these events don't happen overnight like we are absolutely
[1583.98 --> 1587.36]  already working on it it's not going to be happening for like another eight or nine months but
[1587.36 --> 1592.74]  yeah i'm looking forward to it and uh i know i've kind of missed you at the last couple of events i
[1592.74 --> 1596.84]  don't even think either of us went to uh went to the threadripper 2 thing did you go
[1596.84 --> 1606.08]  no no okay well if nothing else i'll see you at ces right sounds good yeah all right okay cool man
[1606.08 --> 1614.58]  all right bye steve all right bye steve you guys should consider just for fun yeah having like an
[1614.58 --> 1621.50]  over a live overclocking panel you could even throw in like make it make it weird hardware or something
[1621.50 --> 1627.90]  i would actually i've always duos in 98 hundreds i've always had more fun overclocking like weird
[1627.90 --> 1633.02]  stuff yeah like get like gt 710s and then just see totally just yeah yeah yeah go to town that'd be
[1633.02 --> 1639.56]  sweet like like bring in some weird hardware and have a little like overclocking thing anyway uh so
[1639.56 --> 1649.14]  thank you to raging gamer um uh sam landis and uh paco sends who all messaged with super chat here i'm
[1649.14 --> 1654.44]  just seeing it now to answer my phone sorry i had it muted because i'm trying to be a bit more of a
[1654.44 --> 1659.38]  professional streamer now um because like my phone would go off all the time during streams in the
[1659.38 --> 1666.44]  past anyway so uh yeah i i just don't get people who think that there's any kind of real like
[1666.44 --> 1672.72]  animosity between us steve jay like any of those people and that's one thing that the computer hardware
[1672.72 --> 1677.68]  review community has had for a long time because we've all been kind of friends for quite a long time
[1677.68 --> 1682.86]  which has been cool there are a couple of notable exceptions well but i'm not going to name any
[1682.86 --> 1690.20]  names but i will say that none of them are youtubers like anyone who thinks that you know me and
[1690.20 --> 1698.62]  anyone has any kind of beef like uh or that we're we even really think of each other as competitors like
[1698.62 --> 1707.08]  um yeah like awesome's coming to dinner like tomorrow yeah just hanging out not making videos
[1707.08 --> 1712.56]  because sometimes that that's nice to do anyway let's get back to let's get back to the chip so
[1712.56 --> 1721.20]  all right so in response to my initial sort of reaction here like what could possibly affect all
[1721.20 --> 1727.42]  those things apparently what it was supposed to affect was ipmi which i've actually made a video
[1727.42 --> 1736.14]  about in the past and what ipmi is is it is remote access to the server and it does allow you to
[1736.14 --> 1742.36]  pretty much control the thing so you can get a video feed out uh you can actually uh power it up and down
[1742.36 --> 1749.30]  you can uh change bio settings you can change pretty much anything that you would like about it
[1749.30 --> 1760.18]  sort of so back to the allegedly all right um so investigators found that the chips had been
[1760.18 --> 1765.94]  inserted at factories run by manufacturing subcontractors in china who make 75 of the world's
[1765.94 --> 1771.22]  mobile phones and 90 of its pcs they also found eventually that it affected almost 30 companies
[1771.22 --> 1775.26]  including a major bank government contractors and the world's most valuable company apple
[1775.26 --> 1781.58]  um in may 2015 so this is going way back in time apple allegedly found malicious chips on super
[1781.58 --> 1785.46]  micro motherboards and severed ties with super micro the following year though for what it described
[1785.46 --> 1794.30]  as unrelated reasons so here's the part where this gets really tricky here's the list of everyone who
[1794.30 --> 1803.20]  has denied this amazon said this is quote it is untrue that aws knew about a supply chain compromise
[1803.20 --> 1808.64]  an issue with malicious chips or hardware modifications when acquiring elemental apple said
[1808.64 --> 1815.22]  on this we can be very clear they have such an apple way of talking don't they apple has never found
[1815.22 --> 1820.76]  malicious chips hardware manipulations or vulnerabilities purposely planted in any server
[1820.76 --> 1827.46]  super micro we remain unaware of any such investigation the chinese government
[1827.46 --> 1833.56]  supply chain safety in cyberspace is an issue of common concern and china is also a victim
[1833.56 --> 1841.90]  okay that's not really the strongest denial no no but the fbi cis and nsa said no comment
[1841.90 --> 1848.60]  now the company's denials are countered by six current and former senior senior national security
[1848.60 --> 1853.16]  officials who in conversations that began during the obama administration and continued under the trump
[1853.16 --> 1856.34]  administration detailed the discovery of the chips and the government's investigation
[1856.34 --> 1862.16]  in all 17 people confirmed the manipulation of super micro's hardware and other elements of the
[1862.16 --> 1867.30]  attacks are those actually confirmed or is that claimed by bloomberg this is all claimed by bloomberg yeah
[1867.30 --> 1881.28]  so yeah i don't know me so there's more allegedly so here's here's part of the problem with all of this
[1881.28 --> 1896.64]  a denial is interesting um but not necessarily the be all and end all it's not like apple is going to
[1896.64 --> 1905.86]  you know yeah all of our networks were compromised yeah well actually they would they would just verify
[1905.86 --> 1912.86]  why would they as long as they've fixed it now and again allegedly one government official said that
[1912.86 --> 1921.30]  no consumer data was known to have been stolen so if apple has found the problem fixed the problem and
[1921.30 --> 1925.46]  doesn't have to worry about this problem popping up at any point in the future
[1925.46 --> 1932.50]  then okay why why would they go ahead and broadcast this on their own
[1932.50 --> 1939.18]  one interesting thing for me how is super micro strip saying we remain unaware of any such investigation
[1939.18 --> 1944.42]  it's just kind of interesting that these it's it's so
[1944.42 --> 1951.26]  it's so much of a blanket no so apple says nope we've never seen anything like this in a server
[1951.26 --> 1956.98]  and china says we're a victim too yeah that's pretty weird well that's a little weird
[1956.98 --> 1963.86]  so i'm not much of a tinfoil hat conspiracy theory nut but i can understand why it would be that these
[1963.86 --> 1970.62]  companies have issued denials and that everyone is speaking um under condition of anonymity on something
[1970.62 --> 1977.94]  like this because you might have an nda or you might be subject to criminal prosecution
[1977.94 --> 1983.18]  if you were to talk about it that's true um that's very fair
[1983.18 --> 1994.46]  so now would they go to bloomberg i don't know it's a wonderful question so all we can really do
[1994.46 --> 2003.34]  is say hey here's what was reported by bloomberg who has not typically been known to be complete yahoos
[2003.34 --> 2012.94]  um here's all the denials that have been issued and there were lots of them and um make of that what you will
[2012.94 --> 2020.94]  i mean the fbi cis and nsa not commenting is not really a denial to be clear yep those are listed under
[2020.94 --> 2028.94]  denials but that's not really a denial the only way that we could know for sure would be if independent
[2028.94 --> 2035.98]  owners of super micro servers contacted super micro asked for a board layout diagram and check their
[2035.98 --> 2041.90]  motherboards to see if these chips were present now the problem with that is that this all allegedly
[2041.90 --> 2047.74]  happened a few years ago and depending on the upgrade cycle of any given data center
[2048.86 --> 2054.22]  it would be fairly simple it would be fairly straightforward for these these middlemen to
[2054.22 --> 2059.42]  intercept only large-scale orders intended for particular customers and if the goal wasn't going
[2059.42 --> 2065.82]  after end users then the goal probably also isn't your mom and pop you know youtube channel like us
[2065.82 --> 2071.02]  and the motherboard in their one-off super micro server it was probably looking for these bulk orders
[2071.02 --> 2076.62]  that were um that were subcontracted out because otherwise i believe super micro actually has their
[2076.62 --> 2083.26]  own manufacturing capabilities don't don't quote me on that one so depending on the upgrade cycle of the
[2083.26 --> 2087.50]  data centers of the companies they were targeting or depending on their policies some of them just
[2087.50 --> 2092.46]  destroy hardware rather than flipping it on ebay whereas others do like you'll see you know when
[2093.02 --> 2098.14]  a hundred gigabit networking gets to the point where it's affordable and practical all of a sudden
[2098.14 --> 2103.66]  you'll see a bunch of 40 gigabit enterprise gear just flood ebay um but not everyone some do that but
[2103.66 --> 2108.46]  some of them don't so we don't know if any of these servers because we don't know what models they are
[2108.46 --> 2114.14]  are have ended up on ebay or have ended up in the hands of individual users so there's still certainly
[2114.94 --> 2122.94]  more to come on all of this but all we can say is what we know for now which is nothing for certain
[2122.94 --> 2128.46]  for the moment and all right i'm gonna drop a plug here real quick oh for my thing is that cool oh yeah
[2128.46 --> 2134.22]  yeah go for it speaking of servers and infrastructure if you guys are into that uh i thought i was done
[2134.22 --> 2140.70]  hiring for a little while but apparently not flow plane media is looking for a system administer uh
[2140.70 --> 2148.38]  administrator uh and what i was reading that for a second um and and is looking for people to apply
[2148.38 --> 2152.86]  now i'm posting in the twitch chat i can't i don't have access to the youtube thing right now but it will
[2152.86 --> 2157.98]  be in the description on youtube later on it'll be on the description of of everything so feel free to
[2157.98 --> 2164.70]  apply the form is like pretty long and asks if you have experience with a ton of different things
[2164.70 --> 2169.10]  if you don't have experience with everything on the list that's okay we're just trying to get a picture
[2169.10 --> 2174.46]  of who you are and what types of things you have experience with having experience with linux
[2174.46 --> 2179.50]  administration is obviously pretty important but the rest of them are a little bit more flexible
[2180.30 --> 2182.46]  cool microsoft experience does not help
[2182.46 --> 2190.46]  uh dang it just well it doesn't right dang it doesn't really cross over time uh let's go ahead
[2190.46 --> 2197.98]  and uh run through our sponsors here so synergy yeah synergy lets you juggle multiple computers
[2197.98 --> 2203.66]  efficiently so there's lots of reasons for people to have more than one computer whether you've got a
[2203.66 --> 2209.34]  windows box for gaming and a linux box for whatever it is you do on linux or you have a mac for work and
[2209.34 --> 2213.82]  you've got a windows machine for home or vice versa or whatever the case may be it can be a bit of a
[2213.82 --> 2219.10]  pain in the butt and you end up with like multiple keyboards and mice or trackpads and and you kind
[2219.10 --> 2224.38]  of go ah yeah okay i know i'm using this one now okay so synergy makes it easy you can just take
[2224.38 --> 2228.46]  whatever operating system you want run it on whatever computer you want and then you can just seamlessly
[2228.46 --> 2233.34]  use one keyboard and mouse to just move the cursor across computers start typing move it across to a
[2233.34 --> 2239.02]  different computer start typing you can control them all at the same time it works on linux mac os
[2239.02 --> 2244.70]  windows and multiple versions of windows so the cool demo that we did a while back was with that
[2244.70 --> 2250.46]  quad input monitor yeah that actually had um four different operating systems running on it that we
[2250.46 --> 2254.62]  were able to seamlessly switch between and use whatever we wanted that's pretty pretty freaking
[2254.62 --> 2261.74]  cool so check it out over at seamless.com synergy linus tech tips next up we've got be quiet oh
[2261.74 --> 2268.70]  interesting do we have like the case here i guess it's pretty big so the be quiet dark base pro
[2268.70 --> 2275.18]  900 orange rev 2 oh that was that modular case that was like one of the last cases you reviewed
[2275.18 --> 2280.86]  like way back in the day so they have a v2 of that now so it's modular it's compatible and it looks
[2280.86 --> 2286.62]  pretty slick the motherboard tray can be decoupled and relocated also it can even be used as a test bench
[2286.62 --> 2291.34]  it's got modular hard drive slots it supports up to five hard drives 10 ssds and two optical drives if
[2291.34 --> 2295.26]  you're still into that sort of thing it's got a functional power supply shroud that doesn't just hide the
[2295.26 --> 2300.14]  power supply it can even be used to mount an ssd or a fan while leaving enough space for a radiator
[2300.14 --> 2307.50]  in the front it's got tempered glass and leds you know because it's 2018 and for io it supports usb 3.1
[2307.50 --> 2311.82]  type c and it's also got a wireless charger for chi enabled smartphones you can check it out on
[2311.82 --> 2321.26]  newegg at the link below the video finally savage jerky oh boy oh oh we got a new shipment i'm just
[2321.26 --> 2325.18]  gonna sit here and eat maple buffalo bacon and you're not going for the reaper again this week
[2325.18 --> 2332.62]  no no i i did that last time so savage jerky as you guys know they've been on here a ton uh they have
[2332.62 --> 2339.58]  a whole bunch of different awesome flavors 13 to be exact of their different uh jerky including bacon
[2339.58 --> 2344.46]  which is i believe what you're going for right now yeah maple buffalo bacon uh they also make barbecue
[2344.46 --> 2349.98]  sauce hot sauce and spice rub i stole some of that last week ha ha ha um their hot sauces oh it says
[2349.98 --> 2354.62]  right here the hot sauces are so good luke and linus took them home yeah so we don't actually have
[2355.58 --> 2360.54]  a like display bottle right now they're really good though the the last one that was here was um
[2361.66 --> 2369.26]  oh what is it called jalapeno mojo okay my like favorite flavor i don't remember the exact name of it
[2369.26 --> 2374.70]  but something mojo um anyways it's it's it's really good stuff the their jerky is made with the best
[2374.70 --> 2379.02]  ingredients without nitrates or preservatives with a goal to create a snack that is full of flavor and
[2379.02 --> 2384.70]  spice that isn't bad for you use offer code ltt to save 10 off of their products you can see the
[2384.70 --> 2392.46]  link here or in the description if you're watching later on jerky i know right all right let's talk
[2392.46 --> 2401.34]  about windows 10 oh boy so this was posted by dan castellanata on the front castle castellanata
[2401.34 --> 2409.74]  castellanata dang it homer simpson that's just his username on the forum not not the real not the
[2409.74 --> 2415.34]  real homer simpson so the original article here is from zdnet and basically
[2417.42 --> 2422.70]  it's always recommended like that's the funny thing about this is it's always recommended when
[2422.70 --> 2430.38]  you perform an update to back up your data yeah but like over the last couple of years is it faded
[2430.38 --> 2436.30]  is it the smartphone shift in the industry that i don't think so because like it used to be that you
[2436.30 --> 2440.54]  got a warning even on like a smartphone because you don't anymore you don't anymore and windows
[2440.54 --> 2445.26]  update's all automatic they try to barely touch it because people used to complain about it all the time
[2445.26 --> 2452.62]  but that's always been considered best practice and then now when everyone's gotten lax about it
[2453.58 --> 2461.02]  it's finally happening allegedly and not just like a file or two apparently one user is claiming to
[2461.02 --> 2472.78]  have lost 220 gigs of data after updating like so the version number is windows 10 1809 and it says here
[2472.78 --> 2480.62]  if you get a warning about intel drivers do not proceed okay so all the amd fanboys are like
[2483.26 --> 2486.06]  so it appears to be related to some interaction with one drive
[2486.94 --> 2491.58]  no great where documents saved in the user directory and not one drive will be deleted oh
[2494.46 --> 2498.86]  okay that's the reverse of what i thought was going to happen and that's so much worse it also
[2498.86 --> 2502.62]  appears that if you've done anything non-standard with one drive or your my documents
[2502.62 --> 2508.54]  folder it may place your files at risk and all right went down the wrong pipe one second
[2509.50 --> 2515.26]  i i definitely have and i think a lot of people here have now now that it's the most practical
[2515.26 --> 2519.26]  way especially if you're running a single box and you don't have a nas the most practical way to run
[2519.26 --> 2525.58]  your storage these days economically is to have a small boot ssd for most of your programs and stuff
[2525.58 --> 2531.82]  and then a large hard drive for your mass storage yeah and the problem is that windows automatically
[2531.82 --> 2538.14]  puts your my documents on your c drive because microsoft still lives in the land of single
[2538.14 --> 2543.90]  drives and computers um it's just it's just baffling to me that it's just not automatically tiered anyway
[2543.90 --> 2551.18]  a whole other conversation um but anyway so a really common thing for people to do because a lot of
[2551.18 --> 2556.46]  programs without asking will just automatically dump crap in my documents my pictures my videos
[2556.46 --> 2560.30]  like that kind of thing so what a lot of users will do if they're managing their data correctly
[2560.30 --> 2564.70]  in fact i think we did a guide that's got like over a million views over on ncix tech tips showing
[2564.70 --> 2571.42]  people how to do this is they'll remap those those stock system folders to a folder on their mechanical
[2571.42 --> 2578.62]  hard drive so if you did that it appears that it might place your files at risk and rolling back
[2578.62 --> 2587.74]  the install does not restore the missing files wow the rollback not restoring the files
[2589.66 --> 2595.10]  in my opinion is worse than it deleting the files in the first place oh yeah way worse way worse
[2595.10 --> 2601.10]  that's gnarly and since we're on the subject what does this windows update even offer well
[2601.10 --> 2607.18]  this was posted by goodbytes on the forum mostly minor changes and to be clear goodbytes is constantly
[2607.18 --> 2615.74]  pointed out as being a hardcore microsoft fanboy yeah um mostly minor changes some features like
[2615.74 --> 2621.58]  sets and alt tab bringing up browser tabs have been delayed so your phone an app that your phone an
[2621.58 --> 2625.98]  app that will allow you to better interact with your phone from your pc allows you to send and receive
[2625.98 --> 2630.70]  sms messages and interact with your 25 most recent images from your gallery on an android phone so that's
[2630.70 --> 2636.78]  cool cool but then that should also be coming to windows 10 version 1803 so while it's headlining as
[2636.78 --> 2641.58]  an 1809 feature it's actually an independent app there's a new clipboard history that syncs with the
[2641.58 --> 2646.14]  cloud and works across devices so it's being added to swift key on ios and android that's pretty cool
[2646.14 --> 2651.02]  that's that is actually pretty cool that is legitimately quite cool also comes to the windows 10 on-screen
[2651.02 --> 2655.26]  keyboard with this update i can't believe that took so long microsoft bought swift key what like two years
[2655.26 --> 2660.94]  ago or something anyway there's a dark theme for file explorer i okay i can see people wanting to
[2660.94 --> 2666.94]  update for that snipping tool is being deprecated being replaced by a new snipping experience no that
[2666.94 --> 2671.90]  can be opened with wind shift s i don't know it might be fine i mean do you do you not use sharex at
[2671.90 --> 2680.30]  this point anyway yeah okay and the usual improvements to microsoft edge browser want more but like on on
[2680.30 --> 2685.66]  systems that i haven't used before having snipping tools really nice new emoji notepad improvements
[2687.10 --> 2693.26]  so all of that sounds worth giving up some data over right okay okay if there wasn't if there wasn't
[2693.26 --> 2699.26]  the data loss i will i will throw them this phone if there wasn't the data loss if you were uh if you
[2699.26 --> 2704.06]  were able to recover your data with a with a system rollback so if they weren't boning you you'd throw them
[2705.74 --> 2710.22]  yeah pretty much this does actually sound like a decent update yeah dark theme is cool the phone app
[2710.22 --> 2717.26]  thing is cool the swift key copy paste cloud thing is cool uh but yeah i kind of need my files so
[2717.26 --> 2727.58]  shoddy not all right and finally macbook pro and imac pros require apple's diagnostics for certain repairs
[2729.98 --> 2735.82]  ot2 chip so you know about the t2 chip right so that's the encryption chip on some of apple's new
[2735.82 --> 2741.58]  devices that basically makes it so that let's talk about the good things first um someone who steals
[2741.58 --> 2746.94]  your device can't get your data i mean it's cool that's pretty cool yeah but it does other stuff
[2747.90 --> 2757.74]  so on the 2018 macbook pro repairs involving the logic board okay touch id all right that's security related
[2757.74 --> 2769.58]  the battery the keyboard the display the top casing and the track the trackpad and the speakers the
[2769.58 --> 2777.74]  speakers is my favorite part the speakers really to be fair the keyboard battery trackpad and speakers
[2777.74 --> 2785.74]  are all only included because of the top case so the t2 chip if you complete if you complete repairs like
[2785.74 --> 2796.78]  those without apple's blessing will brick your macbook pro if you replace a broken speaker now on the imac pro
[2796.78 --> 2803.10]  this makes more sense logic board and flash storage repairs okay fine so if any of those parts are
[2803.10 --> 2810.06]  repaired and apple diagnostics are not run the system will be inoperative and the repair will be incomplete
[2810.06 --> 2817.02]  now the apple diagnostic suite is limited to internal use by apple stores and apple authorized service
[2817.02 --> 2822.78]  providers so independent repair shops without apple certification may be unable to repair certain
[2822.78 --> 2826.38]  parts of these machines and in the case of the macbook it's like basically anything
[2829.26 --> 2834.54]  um now apparently the t2 chip does include more than i thought so system management controller signal
[2834.54 --> 2841.42]  image signal processor audio controller and ssd controller and the secure enclave but why did it
[2841.42 --> 2847.10]  have to include the audio controller i'm sure apple has some kind of reason for that but then they also
[2848.14 --> 2851.98]  could recognize that replacing a speaker is probably benign
[2854.30 --> 2860.78]  really frustrating nothing we say or do is going to change anything i mean apple very intentionally because
[2860.78 --> 2866.70]  you bet your butt they noticed the videos that we made about our experience with the imac pro
[2866.70 --> 2871.74]  very intentionally has not acknowledged us they've not reached out offering to help or anything like
[2871.74 --> 2877.50]  that so apple's just clearly going yeah i think we're just going to keep doing this because people aren't
[2877.50 --> 2884.30]  upset enough so and the frustrating thing that rhymes is it seems to be it seems to be spreading i mean you
[2884.30 --> 2887.82]  and i were talking about this the other day so one of the reasons that i went with a chevy volt
[2887.82 --> 2893.74]  was that i am really not a fan of what tesla is doing with respect to right to repair um the fact
[2893.74 --> 2899.82]  that they are limiting people basically limiting the ability to work on these vehicles to people who
[2899.82 --> 2905.82]  have their you know magic wand blessing why exactly is that why do we accept that as consumers and there's
[2905.82 --> 2913.90]  youtubers who have made careers out of trying to find ways to like forcibly repair teslas did you watch the
[2913.90 --> 2918.46]  same documentary i did then i don't think i've watched the documentary i don't know it was youtube
[2918.46 --> 2924.22]  video but it was in a doc-y style very likely then i forgot the guy what the guy's name was yeah yeah
[2924.22 --> 2931.10]  yeah he's awesome yeah basically like awesome dude he's super awesome flat out um and so it's really
[2931.10 --> 2934.70]  impressive the kind of stuff yeah i don't really understand why we're supporting these things
[2935.50 --> 2941.18]  because it is blatantly anti-consumer yeah period yeah because the security there are some okay there are
[2941.18 --> 2946.78]  some legitimate concerns in both of these areas yes to defend them a little bit yeah electric guitars
[2946.78 --> 2954.30]  can be pretty electric guitars it's my day today man i'm just on point electric cars can be a little
[2954.30 --> 2962.78]  bit problematic if repaired poorly but like so can normal cars explosions and stuff right like i don't
[2962.78 --> 2969.74]  know this doesn't seem super hard to understand that like you're there's some liability involved in
[2969.74 --> 2976.54]  repairing something but generally with most countries laws if the owner of the item is
[2976.54 --> 2981.18]  repairing it they're taking personal liability for the repair and if you pay a shop to repair it that
[2981.18 --> 2988.62]  shop is taking liability for the repair and the reality of it is that this industry of like basically
[2989.34 --> 2998.06]  massive like buckets of of explosive fuel that people ride around in has been around for an awful long
[2998.06 --> 3006.94]  time yeah and i think we've as correct me if i'm wrong but i'm not aware of any situation where
[3007.50 --> 3015.66]  a repair does a repaired something somehow like a repaired ford came back to ford somehow because of an
[3015.66 --> 3022.94]  error that the repair technician made i don't know i mean correct me if i'm wrong please do yeah i'm not
[3022.94 --> 3028.62]  i don't i don't know honestly i'm sure it has happened some dude tried to fix his ford and then
[3029.26 --> 3032.14]  when he failed he brought it to ford and ford was like what the heck dude
[3034.30 --> 3039.82]  i don't know but that's fine oh you're talking like a repair happened on a vehicle and then it blew
[3039.82 --> 3044.62]  up or something and then ford got in trouble yeah i'm not aware of anything like that happening yeah
[3044.62 --> 3051.58]  personally i don't know all right we've got a couple of super chats um serpent xfs appreciate the love among
[3051.58 --> 3058.54]  tech tubers look forward to next year's ltx hashtag never pull out rock on man uh spencer says so
[3058.54 --> 3067.50]  microsoft can fix the update right thanks spencer that's good uh vast horizon i'd send more but this
[3067.50 --> 3074.14]  is all i can afford i love you guys though oh well thank you uh jordan been watching guys a little over
[3074.14 --> 3078.86]  a year you guys boosted my interest in a tech career currently attending college for ictits keep doing
[3078.86 --> 3088.14]  what you do rock on to you too um and i think that pretty much wraps oh this is a good question okay
[3088.14 --> 3094.30]  last topic of the day and this was actually suggested here by none i wonder what would happen
[3095.02 --> 3102.30]  if you used the cpu's integrated heat spreader as a water block so basically just drill two holes
[3102.30 --> 3109.42]  and solder copper pipes onto it okay so a couple problems here um problem numero uno you would have
[3109.42 --> 3118.30]  to have some way of um like protecting the rest of the cpu from the water which will inevitably pick
[3118.30 --> 3124.62]  up some ions that will make it conductive and then obviously that's going to be a pretty bad scene um
[3125.66 --> 3130.54]  problem number the second as far as i know most ihs's are not fully sealed so you would have to make
[3130.54 --> 3135.90]  sure that you actually complete the seal and do a good job there um problem number the next is they're
[3135.90 --> 3142.06]  quite small and so actually getting um like large enough barbs that you'd be able to get the kind of
[3142.06 --> 3149.10]  flow rate that you want for the first for optimal cooling would be a little bit difficult um number
[3149.66 --> 3155.90]  problem number the next is that having the dye soldered or liquid metaled to an ihs
[3156.46 --> 3163.18]  probably increases your surface area helping with cooling more than the benefits of having
[3163.90 --> 3169.50]  um the water directly touching the dye would help i guess is what i'm trying to say so having this
[3169.50 --> 3174.70]  bigger area where you've got a slight um barrier that you have to pass through versus having a very
[3174.70 --> 3182.94]  small area i suspect they probably like thought of that at some point um but it seems like the kind of
[3182.94 --> 3186.46]  thing that we'd be crazy enough to try so i'm not saying we're never going to do it
[3188.86 --> 3195.34]  cool suggestion someone said um sorry wizard mon said 100 fords start firing crashes and not a
[3195.34 --> 3200.86]  single person cares one tesla hits a barrier at high speeds braining an ankle of the driver and the car
[3200.86 --> 3206.86]  slowly starts on fire as he limps away national tv newspapers talk shows reblogged 12 million times
[3206.86 --> 3211.34]  this argument has been brought up many times um
[3213.42 --> 3216.62]  personally i don't think it's a valid enough reason to take rights away from consumers
[3217.82 --> 3222.78]  and i think we can end the show right there cool have a good one thanks for watching
