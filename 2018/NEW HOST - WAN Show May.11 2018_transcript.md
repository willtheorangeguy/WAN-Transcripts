[0.04 --> 6.04]  Press the button and we're live. Welcome to the WAN show. How's it going? How was your week? How was your week?
[6.82 --> 12.00]  It's the Na Show. It's the Na Show again, buddy. I forgot about that. I'm sorry. We're in Bizarro land.
[12.54 --> 14.96]  Yes, we're lazy James. We went by fast.
[15.60 --> 21.20]  Went by fast, eh? I guess. I think having really poor short-term memory helps because
[22.00 --> 25.70]  Basically every Monday people are like, what did you do this weekend?
[25.70 --> 28.80]  I don't know. What did I do on Friday?
[28.80 --> 32.16]  Nah. Something not very novel, apparently.
[32.50 --> 47.48]  Right. Red books. We have an interesting show today, though. If your weekend went by kind of quickly and was uninteresting as well, maybe this will be an interesting cap to the end of the rest of the week. We're talking about people not knowing that they're talking to AI.
[48.12 --> 48.56]  Yes.
[48.70 --> 52.70]  Which is a surprising amount of sophistication from Google Duplex, but we'll talk about that later.
[52.70 --> 57.76]  Google blew everyone's collective mind at their I.O. conference earlier this weekend. We're also going to talk about Boston Dynamics.
[57.76 --> 60.62]  Who's kicking ass on the other part of robot futures.
[61.06 --> 61.26]  Yeah.
[61.26 --> 62.32]  The embodied part.
[62.52 --> 65.00]  Oh, my. Put them together and it can talk and move.
[65.62 --> 71.08]  Also, Nintendo has shared some details about its Switch online service, which is Coolio.
[71.08 --> 78.68]  And rumors about the iPhone 10 Plus sized version of the future this fall. The big one. The big 10.
[78.82 --> 79.76]  I thought it was already pretty big.
[80.22 --> 81.28]  No, we'll talk about that.
[81.34 --> 83.68]  Okay. I'm not really into the whatever. That's fine.
[83.84 --> 84.04]  Woo!
[85.32 --> 86.42]  Can you see his feet?
[87.68 --> 88.52]  When he's in the boat?
[89.08 --> 89.96]  When he's in the boat?
[90.04 --> 90.26]  Yeah.
[90.26 --> 91.16]  Okay, let's uh.
[92.48 --> 92.86]  Again.
[93.40 --> 94.18]  No, not really.
[94.32 --> 94.44]  Kind of.
[94.78 --> 95.76]  The one leg you can.
[96.04 --> 98.56]  You can see his. Yeah, you can see the side of his leg. You can't see his feet, though.
[99.86 --> 100.62]  You can there.
[104.62 --> 107.14]  That was one of the best, like, Mario spring noises.
[107.30 --> 109.12]  That's my best sound I can do.
[109.30 --> 109.98]  That's pretty epic.
[112.78 --> 113.42]  Uh, right.
[113.58 --> 114.96]  I really wish I could do the tube.
[115.20 --> 115.84]  Spectrum.
[116.18 --> 116.68]  Yeah.
[116.68 --> 116.96]  Yeah.
[117.64 --> 119.24]  Stab is jerky and Linus isn't here.
[119.34 --> 120.04]  Ha ha ha ha.
[120.24 --> 120.54]  Also.
[120.94 --> 121.94]  Gonna eat all the maple bacon.
[122.24 --> 123.08]  Fresh bugs.
[123.22 --> 123.76]  Fresh bugs.
[124.84 --> 126.12]  Let's reset this.
[126.34 --> 126.84]  Fresh bugs.
[127.06 --> 128.24]  And then go back to here.
[129.32 --> 129.72]  Yes.
[129.98 --> 130.64]  We did it.
[131.00 --> 131.84]  How's it going, everyone?
[131.92 --> 134.88]  I don't know if the Twitch chat opened, which makes me feel strange.
[135.08 --> 135.74]  I'm gonna fix that.
[137.94 --> 140.34]  You wanna, let's just get right into Google duplexes.
[140.34 --> 143.34]  I think that was the coolest thing I've seen at least all year.
[143.34 --> 147.54]  I think, okay, let's just assume that no one's seen it.
[147.54 --> 150.20]  Our source is SC2 Mitch on the forum.
[150.26 --> 151.06]  Is it SC2 Mitch?
[151.32 --> 151.58]  Yeah.
[151.64 --> 151.90]  Yes.
[151.98 --> 153.64]  And I assume that stands for StarCraft II.
[154.34 --> 155.30]  I've just always assumed that.
[155.30 --> 156.20]  I'm gonna go with it.
[156.62 --> 157.36]  I like it.
[157.40 --> 162.10]  I feel like I've been told what it stood for before, but I don't remember, but I'm gonna
[162.10 --> 162.80]  go with StarCraft.
[163.12 --> 163.26]  Yeah.
[163.82 --> 163.98]  Yeah.
[164.34 --> 167.82]  Anyways, I will never trust anyone on the phone that goes, uh-huh.
[168.28 --> 168.62]  Mm-hmm.
[168.86 --> 169.18]  Mm-hmm.
[169.30 --> 169.62]  Mm-hmm.
[169.62 --> 170.16]  That's it.
[170.22 --> 170.56]  Yeah, yeah.
[170.80 --> 171.14]  Mm-hmm.
[171.14 --> 175.38]  So at Google I.O., which is their conference every year for developers, as opposed to the
[175.38 --> 180.14]  Made by Google hardware event in the fall, which is for consumer products, at Google I.O.
[180.14 --> 183.84]  this week, they were showing off all the new feature tech that they're doing.
[184.00 --> 185.44]  It's way beyond Android now.
[185.86 --> 188.66]  And one of the things they showed is a future service that's gonna be rolling out later
[188.66 --> 189.94]  this year that they call...
[189.94 --> 190.80]  What the hell?
[192.56 --> 195.76]  Why does something weird happen, like, out there every time we're on the show now?
[195.76 --> 196.54]  They're listening to us.
[196.78 --> 196.96]  Yeah.
[196.96 --> 201.72]  Um, they're calling it Google Duplex, and the idea here is that in the future, Google's
[201.72 --> 203.10]  gonna help you get stuff done.
[203.18 --> 206.26]  That's the Google Assistant's job, and one of those things that you need to get done a
[206.26 --> 210.42]  lot of the time is making a phone call to book reservations at a restaurant, or book a hair
[210.42 --> 211.46]  appointment, or something like that.
[211.70 --> 213.24]  And these are the two examples they showed.
[213.60 --> 219.88]  So, Sundar puts up on the screen behind him a real recording of a real call, and I expect
[219.88 --> 222.14]  that they did hundreds or thousands of these calls.
[222.14 --> 226.16]  And they probably cherry-picked, and it seemed like the person that picked up the phone was
[226.16 --> 228.22]  the same person on, like, a few of them that I heard.
[228.62 --> 230.64]  Oh, there's more than just the two he demoed?
[230.64 --> 231.92]  There's more calls you can listen to?
[231.98 --> 236.22]  I think I heard three, but I could be really not remembering accurately.
[236.52 --> 238.80]  Again, we've got a similar short-term memory loss situation.
[239.02 --> 240.34]  At least two, for sure.
[240.86 --> 243.38]  I heard one where it was a guy calling in...
[243.38 --> 243.62]  Yeah.
[243.88 --> 248.12]  And I think there was a girl calling in to something, a hair appointment or something?
[248.20 --> 248.22]  Yeah.
[248.22 --> 248.82]  Those are the ones...
[248.82 --> 249.36]  Calling for my client?
[249.44 --> 250.44]  That's what he demoed, right?
[250.44 --> 250.82]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[250.94 --> 254.62]  So, on the screen, we just see kind of a visualization of a phone call.
[254.72 --> 260.74]  You get the Google Assistant logo representing the robot or the AI, and then just like a phone
[260.74 --> 261.78]  logo representing the person.
[262.72 --> 266.16]  And the person answers the phone and says, you know, this is the hair salon.
[266.22 --> 266.84]  How can I help you?
[266.90 --> 272.40]  And then you hear this impeccably human-sounding voice on the other side saying, hey, I'm calling
[272.40 --> 274.94]  on behalf of a client, and I'm looking to book a hair appointment.
[274.94 --> 280.02]  And then a conversation ensues, and the result of which is a hair appointment is booked.
[280.02 --> 284.00]  And then I guess the user's phone would receive a notification that says, you have got a hair
[284.00 --> 284.34]  appointment.
[284.46 --> 290.36]  So, you can just be like, hey, assistant, book me a hair appointment at this place for this
[290.36 --> 293.54]  time or between this time, between 10 and 12 on Friday.
[293.74 --> 296.60]  And then a few minutes later, you're going to get a notification that says, yep, that's
[296.60 --> 296.80]  done.
[298.30 --> 298.74]  Yeah.
[300.62 --> 303.02]  Someone in chat said, Luke is skeptical as usual.
[303.24 --> 306.02]  I think it will work as advertised service people stick to a script.
[306.02 --> 311.46]  I am skeptical, but I think it will usually work because of what you just said.
[311.54 --> 311.68]  Yeah.
[311.72 --> 316.16]  Usually, when you're calling into a restaurant, there's a fairly formulaic way that you would
[316.16 --> 316.82]  book a reservation.
[316.92 --> 317.82]  That is absolutely true.
[317.98 --> 318.10]  Right.
[318.10 --> 319.86]  And it's not even necessarily that they stick to a script.
[320.00 --> 324.32]  It's just there's fairly basic information that needs to be passed back and forth, and
[324.32 --> 325.70]  it's not that complicated to figure out what is going to be there.
[325.70 --> 326.06]  That's right.
[326.06 --> 332.38]  So, that kind of feeds into how the voice sounds because it sounds really realistic.
[332.66 --> 335.58]  It sounds more realistic than the Google Assistant voice.
[335.76 --> 341.88]  It even sounds more realistic than the Google Assistant voice using WaveNet, which is another
[341.88 --> 343.14]  thing they announced at IO.
[343.26 --> 349.68]  WaveNet, which was a system that was outlined in a paper by Google's DeepMind like 18 months
[349.68 --> 351.44]  ago, was finally being integrated into the Google Assistant.
[351.44 --> 356.46]  So, this is just taking in raw waveforms and making your phonemes based on that.
[356.70 --> 358.52]  It makes the Google Assistant voice way better.
[358.94 --> 363.12]  They demoed that, and it still wasn't as good as what we hear on Duplex, which makes me think
[363.12 --> 367.26]  that what we hear on Duplex, for the most part, is pre-recorded soundbites.
[367.86 --> 372.92]  You can hear it sounds a little inhuman when they say numbers and dates and times because
[372.92 --> 375.16]  that's kind of turnkey.
[375.30 --> 376.06]  They plug that in.
[376.28 --> 376.36]  Yeah.
[376.36 --> 382.52]  But the reason they would be able to use pre-recorded soundbites is because the possible set of
[382.52 --> 388.58]  interactions is much decreased when you're in this kind of scenario where you just need
[388.58 --> 389.94]  to do this one thing.
[390.28 --> 394.66]  And a lot of it is like, let me check that for you, or would you mind going on hold for
[394.66 --> 396.96]  a second, or something like that, where you just need to confirm.
[397.62 --> 401.18]  So, the amount of times, that's why I keep on saying that mm-hmm thing, because the amount
[401.18 --> 404.04]  of times, and that's all you really need to say on the phone, and that's often all you
[404.04 --> 413.52]  really say on the phone, but the amount of times that the AI says it and does it very
[413.52 --> 415.50]  believingly, very believably?
[415.72 --> 416.08]  Believably.
[416.20 --> 416.48]  You got it.
[416.82 --> 419.18]  And it's really good.
[419.26 --> 426.40]  The one thing that I noticed was there's a slight delay, a little bit more than I feel
[426.40 --> 429.40]  like most people would take before they say something, but not very much.
[429.40 --> 433.36]  And I think to counteract that, like they programmed in some delay.
[433.84 --> 438.28]  Like when you answer the phone and say hello, they program in a wait, a B, because no one
[438.28 --> 439.10]  just goes, hello, hello.
[439.50 --> 439.70]  Yeah.
[439.98 --> 441.00]  You wait a second, right?
[441.12 --> 443.82]  And I might have been trying to look for it.
[444.46 --> 445.96]  They also programmed in ums.
[446.40 --> 448.72]  I mean, there's going to be some processing time too, right?
[448.80 --> 448.94]  Yeah.
[449.92 --> 450.54]  Really cool.
[450.62 --> 456.14]  So, the reason that they can do that is because when I'm talking to my Google Assistant, I could
[456.14 --> 462.08]  say anything to it and it has to be able to respond, but as this user on Twitch says, in
[462.08 --> 468.58]  this situation, not only is the computer basically performing a script, a narrow set of actions,
[468.66 --> 472.20]  of possible actions, but so is a human because the human on the other end is just trying to
[472.20 --> 473.50]  get some basic information from you.
[473.52 --> 474.34]  Someone's calling in.
[474.56 --> 475.60]  What time do they want to come?
[475.70 --> 476.18]  How many people?
[478.44 --> 481.92]  Everyone's complaining about the contrast, so I'm trying to fix it, but I'm really bad.
[482.00 --> 482.42]  I like that.
[482.46 --> 483.38]  It's like an Instagram filter.
[483.38 --> 487.76]  I'm really bad at doing anything related to this at all.
[487.98 --> 490.96]  So, how brittle do you think this system is going to be when it launches?
[491.36 --> 492.70]  That's everyone's first complaint.
[492.88 --> 497.56]  Like, what if someone just says, enjoying the weather we're having and it doesn't know what
[497.56 --> 497.98]  that means?
[498.42 --> 498.64]  Yeah.
[498.70 --> 501.26]  Like, if they need to do something and they're trying to carry on small talk.
[501.40 --> 501.54]  Yeah.
[502.74 --> 505.08]  Honestly, there might be some stuff set in.
[505.14 --> 509.68]  I wouldn't be too surprised if there's some stuff set in to, like, basically cut those
[509.68 --> 512.28]  conversations off by just using the, mm-hmm.
[512.74 --> 513.00]  Yeah.
[513.28 --> 514.24]  Enjoying the weather we're having?
[514.64 --> 514.82]  Mm-hmm.
[514.92 --> 519.58]  Well, another difference is that during the demo, the assistant never announces itself
[519.58 --> 520.26]  as such.
[520.32 --> 522.22]  It never says, hey, you're talking to a robot.
[522.34 --> 526.74]  And a lot of people got pretty angry about that, but Google has, since the demo, promised
[526.74 --> 531.32]  that when it rolls out, it will announce itself as a virtual assistant.
[531.32 --> 536.06]  So, then you're not even going to have those problems because you know you're talking to
[536.06 --> 536.44]  a person.
[536.64 --> 540.38]  But you're not just going to hang up like you or me might when we answer our phone and
[540.38 --> 543.72]  there's a robot there because it's business and you don't want to lose that business.
[543.92 --> 545.24]  You want that appointment to get made.
[546.58 --> 548.92]  Most, well, most businesses probably wouldn't hang up.
[549.80 --> 550.08]  Yeah.
[550.38 --> 554.86]  I, no, I, I completely agree because you want the business, but I think it's, I think it's,
[555.44 --> 557.46]  I didn't know that it was going to announce.
[558.60 --> 559.46]  That's a new development.
[560.10 --> 560.46]  Okay.
[561.32 --> 566.30]  Because I feel like now if I was a business, if I had a text version, I would just want
[566.30 --> 566.62]  that.
[567.74 --> 569.86]  Oh, you mean like if there's just an online web form?
[570.16 --> 570.32]  Yeah.
[570.70 --> 570.94]  Yeah.
[571.06 --> 573.24]  I would rather that Google just filled that out.
[573.72 --> 576.26]  Well, well, you would have to pay for that though.
[576.42 --> 578.78]  You would have to build that, that booking system.
[578.90 --> 579.76]  Whereas Google built this.
[579.78 --> 582.22]  But there's a lot of like open table for restaurants.
[582.38 --> 582.56]  Yeah.
[582.56 --> 583.52]  There's open table.
[583.66 --> 590.08]  There's like a lot of different services like this have services out there that work with
[590.08 --> 590.86]  them to pair that together.
[590.86 --> 593.96]  Like now I don't know if open table like takes something.
[594.52 --> 596.06]  I can't see how they could take a cut.
[596.06 --> 599.84]  But like, I'm sure there's some benefit there.
[599.84 --> 603.02]  Like maybe you have to pay them to be on it or there's ads or something.
[603.10 --> 603.70]  I have no idea.
[604.06 --> 609.68]  There's another angle with the virtual assistant announcing itself, which is eavesdropping laws.
[609.94 --> 615.90]  So when at least a dozen states, there's laws because it's, it doesn't have ears like you
[615.90 --> 616.16]  and me.
[616.22 --> 617.26]  It's not hearing the conversation.
[617.26 --> 619.36]  It needs to actually record the conversation.
[619.36 --> 619.64]  Yeah.
[619.64 --> 625.12]  And because you're recording the conversation, there's states where every party on the, in
[625.12 --> 628.34]  the conversation, each party has to consent to it being recorded.
[628.54 --> 631.58]  So it either has to say, this is a virtual assistant.
[632.44 --> 633.88]  Can I record this?
[633.88 --> 637.98]  Or maybe it can get away with just announcing this is being recorded.
[638.20 --> 639.90]  And if you don't hang up, you consent.
[640.32 --> 642.28]  I don't know the particular laws for each state.
[642.28 --> 645.32]  I feel like that could work.
[646.02 --> 647.58]  Just so you know, this call is being recorded.
[647.80 --> 649.28]  Please hang up if you don't want it to be.
[649.64 --> 649.68]  Yeah.
[649.78 --> 650.24]  But then.
[653.50 --> 654.38]  Or maybe you.
[654.40 --> 656.02]  You would have already started recording.
[656.14 --> 657.54]  So I think you already broke the law.
[657.84 --> 660.76]  So you'd have to be like, this call will be recorded in however much time.
[661.22 --> 661.76]  Please hang up.
[661.78 --> 662.20]  I don't know.
[662.32 --> 662.68]  I don't know.
[662.76 --> 663.16]  That's weird.
[663.74 --> 664.62]  Maybe they just won't let it.
[664.72 --> 665.28]  Well, it doesn't.
[665.36 --> 667.64]  No, it doesn't necessarily have to have begun recording yet.
[669.18 --> 671.14]  It can just say that script.
[672.28 --> 674.02]  Before it starts hearing.
[674.44 --> 675.16]  That's what I was saying.
[675.42 --> 675.56]  Yeah.
[675.96 --> 677.98]  So they might have to delay when it starts recording.
[678.38 --> 678.60]  Right.
[678.86 --> 680.96]  This call will be recorded in X amount of seconds.
[681.08 --> 682.14]  Hang up if you don't want it to be.
[682.30 --> 682.48]  Yeah.
[682.62 --> 683.44]  And then start the conversation.
[685.04 --> 686.30]  I don't know how to fix this for you guys.
[686.44 --> 686.88]  I'm sorry.
[687.00 --> 687.94]  I don't know camera stuff.
[688.12 --> 690.12]  I've slightly moved all the dials.
[690.40 --> 692.46]  I went down and people hated it.
[692.56 --> 693.72]  I went up and people hated it.
[693.86 --> 694.30]  I don't know.
[694.42 --> 694.84]  I'm sorry.
[695.72 --> 697.58]  Some camera person will have to fix it eventually.
[697.58 --> 700.00]  I don't know why Wancho gets screwed up every week.
[700.14 --> 700.68]  But it does.
[700.96 --> 702.04]  We have way more lights this time.
[702.04 --> 703.30]  For the demo.
[703.74 --> 706.32]  When the virtual assistant was calling all these people.
[706.44 --> 707.32]  When they're collecting this data.
[707.40 --> 708.72]  And they're doing their test runs.
[708.84 --> 710.74]  They did presumably hundreds of these calls.
[711.34 --> 712.72]  I think this is kind of like.
[712.78 --> 714.12]  It might go down in the history books.
[714.76 --> 715.60]  Because when.
[716.12 --> 717.12]  What other time.
[717.52 --> 718.54]  Like if we live in a future.
[718.72 --> 720.26]  Where there's AIs that look like us.
[720.28 --> 720.88]  And think like us.
[720.90 --> 721.56]  And are better than us.
[722.00 --> 723.50]  You're going to be able to look back in time.
[723.64 --> 725.82]  And point to a scenario where.
[725.82 --> 726.16]  Yep.
[726.28 --> 729.54]  That was the first time that a human didn't know they were talking to an AI.
[729.54 --> 729.62]  Why?
[731.86 --> 732.22]  Yeah.
[732.32 --> 733.76]  Because no one leaked this.
[734.20 --> 735.02]  No one was like.
[735.10 --> 736.90]  I think a computer called me.
[737.66 --> 739.74]  Like I never saw an article about that.
[740.94 --> 741.34]  You know what I mean?
[741.34 --> 742.02]  Like they didn't know.
[742.20 --> 742.32]  Yeah.
[742.32 --> 742.52]  They just.
[742.66 --> 743.58]  They talked to it and they hung up.
[743.82 --> 745.04]  I mean there's been chatbots.
[745.40 --> 746.88]  People could be talking to chatbots.
[747.04 --> 747.24]  Yeah.
[747.24 --> 748.28]  There's the Turing test.
[748.36 --> 749.34]  Which again is chat based.
[749.50 --> 749.62]  Not.
[750.52 --> 750.80]  Yeah.
[750.80 --> 751.54]  Not audio based.
[751.54 --> 751.68]  Yeah.
[752.36 --> 754.18]  But even in the Turing test.
[754.30 --> 754.48]  The.
[755.08 --> 755.56]  The.
[756.20 --> 756.80]  Participants.
[757.26 --> 758.22]  They know that.
[758.38 --> 758.78]  One of the.
[759.02 --> 760.90]  The one of the conversations they're going to be having.
[761.00 --> 762.14]  Is going to have an AI.
[762.30 --> 763.92]  So like they're looking out for it.
[764.74 --> 765.04]  Yeah.
[767.74 --> 768.46]  Pretty cool.
[769.02 --> 771.14]  And the Turing test could be used.
[771.42 --> 772.16]  With chat.
[772.30 --> 773.74]  With vocal chat in mind.
[774.16 --> 775.36]  To just be adapted for it.
[775.36 --> 777.06]  Like I know it's a specific thing.
[777.06 --> 778.74]  It hasn't been conducted like that though.
[778.92 --> 779.18]  Yeah.
[779.34 --> 779.70]  I know.
[779.86 --> 780.70]  But like it could be.
[780.76 --> 781.68]  You could be adapted for that.
[781.72 --> 783.46]  There's lots of ways to adapt the imitation game.
[783.50 --> 784.72]  Because it's actually not that great of a test.
[785.62 --> 786.36]  But anyway.
[787.84 --> 788.16]  Yeah.
[788.28 --> 789.70]  Let's just go right into Boston Dynamics.
[789.70 --> 790.56]  I think it's very cool.
[790.56 --> 792.38]  I don't want to like play the audio on stream.
[792.48 --> 793.52]  Because I don't know how well it's going to come out.
[793.58 --> 794.10]  And all that kind of stuff.
[794.20 --> 796.18]  But if you guys haven't heard of it before now.
[796.28 --> 797.70]  I would definitely look up Google Duplex.
[797.82 --> 798.70]  And listen to the calls.
[799.16 --> 800.82]  Because it's way more interesting.
[801.14 --> 802.06]  Than it probably seems.
[802.62 --> 803.12]  In fact.
[803.48 --> 804.24]  If you have.
[804.66 --> 804.76]  It's.
[804.76 --> 805.80]  I mean when you're on YouTube.
[805.80 --> 807.58]  It looks like the video is three hours long.
[807.66 --> 807.94]  But if you.
[808.06 --> 809.22]  It's probably only an hour and a half.
[809.26 --> 810.16]  And if you have that time.
[810.20 --> 811.30]  I would say watch all of IO.
[811.78 --> 812.50]  There was a lot of.
[812.50 --> 813.06]  I want to.
[813.16 --> 814.58]  There was a lot of cool stuff in there.
[814.64 --> 815.48]  Not just Duplex.
[815.58 --> 816.70]  Duplex was definitely the coolest.
[816.86 --> 816.94]  But.
[817.16 --> 818.44]  Before the end of this weekend.
[818.44 --> 819.60]  I will have seen the whole thing.
[820.02 --> 820.30]  That's like.
[820.30 --> 821.24]  Have you seen the bit with lens?
[821.66 --> 821.86]  No.
[822.14 --> 822.90]  Oh it's so crazy.
[823.00 --> 824.06]  I've had almost no time.
[824.18 --> 825.12]  I've been super slammed this week.
[825.12 --> 827.42]  Because now that they've got such good image recognition.
[827.84 --> 831.04]  They're getting closer to Google's end game goal.
[831.22 --> 831.66]  Which was.
[832.84 --> 833.90]  Information's coming at you.
[833.90 --> 835.52]  Without you needing to query it.
[836.04 --> 836.18]  With.
[836.30 --> 837.36]  Like you're walking down the street.
[837.44 --> 838.84]  Let's say you have some cool glasses.
[839.36 --> 840.70]  And you just look at a building.
[840.94 --> 842.00]  The image recognition.
[842.92 --> 845.06]  Knows that that building is the Washington Monument.
[845.22 --> 845.60]  And then.
[845.88 --> 848.08]  A card comes up with the information about it.
[849.34 --> 850.10]  Looks so awesome.
[850.24 --> 850.54]  And it's.
[850.70 --> 852.16]  It's integrated with the AR kit.
[852.22 --> 853.70]  So it's like a nice distance away from you.
[853.74 --> 854.58]  Like there's nice depth.
[854.68 --> 855.04]  Oh yeah.
[855.12 --> 855.26]  Yeah.
[855.26 --> 855.44]  Yeah.
[855.56 --> 856.24]  So it doesn't feel like.
[856.50 --> 856.70]  It's not just.
[856.70 --> 858.38]  It's not just a window that comes up here.
[858.46 --> 859.84]  It's like anchored in space.
[859.84 --> 860.04]  Right.
[860.08 --> 860.66]  It's so sweet.
[860.82 --> 861.24]  That's cool.
[861.24 --> 861.64]  Okay.
[862.64 --> 863.60]  So now we have.
[864.24 --> 865.70]  Well the source is Linus's email.
[865.86 --> 867.28]  Thank you very much Linus's email.
[868.10 --> 869.48]  I think Linus wants to talk about this one.
[869.66 --> 870.14]  He does?
[870.36 --> 871.56]  Well that's why he sent it to me.
[872.80 --> 873.80]  Why does he care?
[874.30 --> 874.84]  I don't know.
[875.74 --> 877.26]  I mean you can just do it.
[877.40 --> 877.88]  No that's fine.
[877.90 --> 878.52]  You can snipe him.
[878.60 --> 880.08]  There's another Nintendo one we can do.
[880.84 --> 881.44]  I also don't.
[881.54 --> 882.02]  With this one?
[883.08 --> 883.40]  No.
[883.46 --> 884.34]  That's another Linus one.
[884.46 --> 884.72]  Okay.
[884.72 --> 885.96]  The.
[889.18 --> 890.34]  I don't care what we talk about.
[890.42 --> 890.98]  I'm freaking down.
[890.98 --> 892.80]  I want to talk about Boston Dynamics.
[892.90 --> 893.14]  Sure.
[893.28 --> 893.52]  Let's do it.
[893.52 --> 896.18]  Because we're on to this robot like kind of kick right now.
[896.28 --> 896.48]  Yeah.
[896.78 --> 899.34]  So this again was SE2 Mitch who posted it in the forum.
[899.60 --> 900.10]  Thanks my dude.
[901.06 --> 901.94]  Boston Dynamics.
[902.26 --> 902.94]  They're amazing.
[903.18 --> 906.48]  They make bewildering robots like new backflips and stuff.
[906.82 --> 908.62]  They have a kick ass YouTube channel.
[908.76 --> 909.78]  You saw the door opening one right?
[910.12 --> 910.34]  Yeah.
[910.34 --> 913.14]  Where it holds the door open for the other one to walk through.
[913.48 --> 914.52]  Go to their YouTube channel.
[914.72 --> 915.46]  It's so cool.
[915.54 --> 918.78]  Every few months they upload a new video of what the progress they've made.
[919.40 --> 920.88]  And two days ago they did that.
[920.96 --> 922.16]  They uploaded two new videos.
[922.56 --> 923.92]  One shows the Atlas robot.
[924.04 --> 924.62]  Can we play it?
[925.12 --> 925.40]  Yeah.
[925.70 --> 926.72]  We don't need audio or anything.
[926.86 --> 927.26]  Yeah.
[927.50 --> 927.86]  This is.
[927.94 --> 928.56]  I want to put this.
[928.76 --> 931.16]  I'm going to make this into a GIF and put it on my Twitter and pin it.
[931.50 --> 932.52]  This is so inspiring.
[932.58 --> 932.78]  Oh no.
[932.84 --> 933.16]  Here we go.
[933.24 --> 933.94]  It's Grammarly.
[936.64 --> 937.90]  Look at that thing.
[939.52 --> 941.86]  That is so awesome.
[941.88 --> 943.16]  You can do it little buddy.
[943.68 --> 944.44]  Uneven ground.
[944.88 --> 945.40]  Grass.
[946.34 --> 947.26]  Variable friction.
[947.56 --> 948.56]  That's a different type of ground.
[948.56 --> 950.36]  I want the Rocky theme in the background.
[950.74 --> 951.02]  Yeah.
[951.26 --> 952.88]  I want him to go up the steps.
[952.88 --> 953.02]  Yeah.
[953.02 --> 953.12]  Yeah.
[953.12 --> 954.82]  I wish he raised his arms up.
[954.88 --> 956.24]  He does that in the back of the video.
[956.80 --> 957.24]  Oh yeah.
[957.30 --> 957.40]  Yeah.
[957.40 --> 957.52]  No.
[957.54 --> 957.98]  That makes sense.
[958.06 --> 958.16]  Yeah.
[958.22 --> 958.36]  Yeah.
[958.76 --> 958.98]  Yeah.
[958.98 --> 959.30]  Yeah.
[961.30 --> 961.58]  Yeah.
[961.82 --> 962.34]  Oh sweet.
[962.34 --> 964.82]  Imagine how hard that is to run.
[964.82 --> 967.04]  I know kids who can't run.
[967.74 --> 968.84]  That's amazing man.
[968.84 --> 972.86]  The only thing is in most of their videos when they have one of their robots walking around.
[972.86 --> 976.76]  Somebody kicks it or pushes it with a hockey stick or something and they don't do that in this video.
[976.76 --> 976.98]  Yeah.
[976.98 --> 979.50]  And I would assume that's because it can't take it yet.
[979.92 --> 981.32]  Because if it could take it they'd show it.
[981.52 --> 981.80]  Yeah.
[981.80 --> 985.94]  It also looks like those are what do you call this?
[986.00 --> 986.86]  Linear hips.
[987.82 --> 988.22]  Oh yeah.
[988.32 --> 990.38]  So if they hit the side it'll probably just tip over.
[990.68 --> 991.28]  Oh yeah.
[991.58 --> 992.02]  I see.
[992.14 --> 992.28]  Yeah.
[992.34 --> 993.98]  I want to give me a figure eight here.
[994.28 --> 996.88]  But at the same time it might be able to the arms aren't.
[998.22 --> 999.12]  So they might be able to teach.
[1000.18 --> 1001.10]  Good job buddy.
[1001.10 --> 1002.72]  Can we just play that again and again?
[1002.90 --> 1003.70]  It's a jump.
[1003.80 --> 1004.88]  I just want to make sounds.
[1006.66 --> 1007.38]  Where is it?
[1010.56 --> 1011.30]  Now you do one.
[1011.80 --> 1020.08]  I love that you can make that noise.
[1020.18 --> 1021.32]  I've never heard anyone do that before.
[1021.70 --> 1024.00]  I really wish I could do the going down a tube sound.
[1024.40 --> 1024.66]  Not even.
[1024.88 --> 1025.70]  I don't know if a human.
[1025.88 --> 1026.20]  Yeah.
[1026.48 --> 1027.10]  It's not even close.
[1027.38 --> 1027.58]  Yeah.
[1028.58 --> 1030.22]  I can't even possibly.
[1030.72 --> 1033.96]  The only reason why I went choo choo choo is so people would know what we were even talking about.
[1034.32 --> 1035.24]  That's not bad.
[1035.30 --> 1037.38]  I want to see that robot juke a football player out.
[1037.46 --> 1039.44]  You know like go this way and spin or something.
[1039.68 --> 1039.86]  Yeah.
[1040.00 --> 1040.56]  That'll be epic.
[1040.56 --> 1043.88]  See it would need multi-directional hips.
[1044.04 --> 1044.40]  You're right.
[1044.74 --> 1047.04]  Because just doing this won't work for that.
[1047.26 --> 1054.32]  So the second video that they uploaded was their Spot Mini which is the smaller quadruped dog-like one.
[1054.32 --> 1062.18]  It's the one that you might have seen videos where it has a weird arm slash head slash whatever you want to call it that opens doors and recycles cans.
[1062.18 --> 1064.26]  In this video it doesn't have that.
[1064.26 --> 1068.14]  Instead it has this extra little modular on the back.
[1068.14 --> 1069.12]  This white box.
[1069.70 --> 1074.16]  And what you're watching is this thing navigate itself.
[1074.64 --> 1075.96]  It's kind of self-driving right now.
[1076.72 --> 1076.82]  Yeah.
[1076.82 --> 1081.78]  It has a route that I believe it's trying to do and it's just moving through space.
[1081.88 --> 1086.68]  If you click forward in the video they'll actually put a render on the side of the screen to show you the data that it's seeing.
[1088.30 --> 1088.70]  Yeah.
[1088.80 --> 1089.28]  There we go.
[1089.28 --> 1101.22]  So reading up if you look at the description of the YouTube video what it actually says is it's not going through this as a novel situation.
[1101.48 --> 1107.10]  They've actually manually piloted the robot through this area first to teach it.
[1107.16 --> 1107.40]  Okay.
[1107.40 --> 1110.46]  To map it and then it goes through on its own after that.
[1111.68 --> 1112.80]  Which is still useful.
[1112.98 --> 1113.50]  I mean if you're.
[1113.52 --> 1114.50]  But it's not trying to.
[1114.62 --> 1115.16]  I don't think.
[1116.30 --> 1116.66]  Yes.
[1116.76 --> 1117.74]  But I don't think it's trying to follow.
[1118.02 --> 1123.52]  So some people might think like okay I've done this once so it's going to do like exactly step by step.
[1123.64 --> 1125.14]  I think it's trying to go to the same destination.
[1125.36 --> 1125.60]  Correct.
[1125.84 --> 1130.32]  But it's still like they could have put a box in the way or something and it would be able to deal with.
[1130.32 --> 1130.72]  That's right.
[1130.78 --> 1132.22]  It's not on like a set path.
[1132.32 --> 1132.52]  Yeah.
[1132.72 --> 1134.56]  It's just going through a known space.
[1134.56 --> 1137.66]  It's like they gave it a map but like it still had to get there.
[1137.94 --> 1140.04]  Which I mean self-driving cars do have that.
[1140.18 --> 1140.34]  Yeah.
[1141.04 --> 1141.28]  Yeah.
[1142.78 --> 1145.12]  I just wanted to clarify because some people might not understand.
[1145.40 --> 1145.56]  Yeah.
[1145.78 --> 1146.72]  That's pretty sweet.
[1147.88 --> 1152.48]  I mean the fact that it has to drive through first seems like it would limit the applications.
[1152.48 --> 1156.90]  If you're thinking about like a conflict zone then you know you're not going to be able to bring this thing in first.
[1156.90 --> 1163.76]  But maybe you could fly in a small drone first or use a different type of robot to or different type of vehicle to map the area.
[1163.76 --> 1163.80]  Yeah.
[1164.16 --> 1166.76]  It's also this is also completely autonomous navigation.
[1167.58 --> 1176.68]  So like if you're bringing in another robot you could like you could use this as some sort of like patrol or to check your own areas or something like that.
[1176.68 --> 1180.12]  And have manually controlled things to check out areas that you haven't seen before.
[1180.38 --> 1180.50]  Right.
[1180.80 --> 1182.48]  Go back to the part where it's on the stairs.
[1183.14 --> 1188.30]  There's actually something you'll notice when it gets to the top of the stairs and wants to turn around again.
[1188.30 --> 1192.02]  So you could think we're looking at its butt right now right.
[1192.86 --> 1194.12]  Now skip ahead just a burr.
[1194.14 --> 1195.54]  It's like its face right.
[1196.38 --> 1198.88]  So it gets to the top now it wants to go back.
[1200.88 --> 1201.02]  Yeah.
[1201.02 --> 1206.50]  It wants to go down and see how it turned around.
[1206.62 --> 1209.32]  It's like its legs are optimized for kind of one direction.
[1209.62 --> 1214.18]  So now relative to what we were looking at before it was kind of going backwards down those stairs.
[1215.62 --> 1216.20]  Now is he going to.
[1216.40 --> 1216.62]  Yeah.
[1216.70 --> 1219.60]  So he always wants that end to be lower.
[1220.32 --> 1221.10]  Face down.
[1221.22 --> 1221.86]  Ass up.
[1221.86 --> 1226.88]  I guess it's got those grasshopper legs.
[1227.14 --> 1227.38]  Yeah.
[1227.84 --> 1229.18]  I want to see this thing jump.
[1229.38 --> 1231.20]  Did you see that other one they have that's on wheels?
[1232.56 --> 1232.68]  Yeah.
[1232.68 --> 1233.38]  It rips around.
[1233.62 --> 1235.44]  It could jump like four feet or something.
[1235.86 --> 1236.74]  That thing was crazy.
[1236.92 --> 1237.48]  I love that thing.
[1237.52 --> 1239.60]  I don't know the name of that one but so badass.
[1239.76 --> 1240.60]  These guys are the best.
[1240.60 --> 1242.30]  Are those that's like murdered friends?
[1242.44 --> 1243.04]  Did you see that?
[1244.22 --> 1245.12]  Did you see that though?
[1245.12 --> 1245.96]  Maybe they're sleeping.
[1246.20 --> 1246.66]  Look at that.
[1247.24 --> 1247.84]  Oh god.
[1249.52 --> 1251.00]  Oh they're all mangled.
[1251.00 --> 1253.26]  That one is like oh I'm okay.
[1253.44 --> 1254.46]  Too many hockey sticks.
[1254.62 --> 1255.00]  The other one.
[1255.20 --> 1255.68]  Yeah exactly.
[1255.68 --> 1256.40]  They kick me too hard.
[1256.76 --> 1258.36]  Why are you still kicking us?
[1258.68 --> 1258.88]  No.
[1259.28 --> 1259.92]  So okay.
[1260.46 --> 1265.20]  I read that and I was googling about it and then I came across this other article.
[1265.30 --> 1266.42]  It's like hold up.
[1267.42 --> 1268.26]  Stop the press.
[1268.76 --> 1271.80]  Spot Mini is going to be on sale next year.
[1272.20 --> 1274.80]  In 2019 you're going to be able to buy one of those things.
[1274.88 --> 1275.36]  How much?
[1275.44 --> 1276.02]  I didn't know.
[1276.22 --> 1277.00]  It doesn't say.
[1277.34 --> 1277.84]  They don't say.
[1277.84 --> 1282.02]  But I didn't think these things were going to be for sale to the general public like anytime soon.
[1283.48 --> 1284.34]  So it says.
[1284.60 --> 1289.54]  I can't wait for the like the Casey Neistat drone review of this.
[1289.64 --> 1290.76]  We got to get one for sure.
[1290.86 --> 1294.60]  No I'm just saying like it just seems like the kind of thing he would buy.
[1296.06 --> 1296.76]  Yeah I don't know.
[1296.90 --> 1298.54]  Like ride it around New York somehow.
[1298.60 --> 1299.42]  I think we should.
[1299.72 --> 1301.38]  We shouldn't even do a sponsored thing.
[1301.46 --> 1305.04]  We should just outright buy one so we can have it around all the time.
[1305.04 --> 1309.02]  I want to put my lunch on it and like get it to carry it down the stairs for me and stuff.
[1310.04 --> 1311.80]  You can get it with different attachments.
[1311.80 --> 1313.84]  And then to rig a camera onto it.
[1314.98 --> 1316.48]  You can get different attachments.
[1316.84 --> 1317.02]  Yeah.
[1317.48 --> 1324.64]  And you know have you ever seen it do the chicken head thing where it can move its body but the head stays in one position.
[1325.14 --> 1327.20]  So we could do that with like it's like basically a gimbal.
[1328.58 --> 1329.28]  That would be cool.
[1329.60 --> 1330.28]  Like we don't need to hire.
[1330.36 --> 1332.88]  You know that video where we were saying we're hiring another shooter.
[1332.98 --> 1333.24]  We're not.
[1333.30 --> 1334.40]  We're just going to wait it out.
[1334.84 --> 1335.30]  Spot Mini.
[1335.52 --> 1337.32]  We're just getting a Spot Mini to walk around.
[1338.16 --> 1338.68]  Thing's awesome.
[1338.84 --> 1340.30]  Last 90 minutes it's all electric.
[1340.30 --> 1341.86]  Obviously it's wireless.
[1342.74 --> 1344.58]  You're probably not going to buy one when they come out.
[1344.62 --> 1346.22]  They're probably going to be stupid expensive.
[1346.46 --> 1348.00]  Probably going to be tens of thousands of dollars.
[1348.12 --> 1348.24]  Yeah.
[1349.20 --> 1350.70]  And not really for you yet.
[1350.76 --> 1351.94]  Although it will be.
[1352.34 --> 1354.12]  Probably for governments and PMCs mostly.
[1354.36 --> 1356.46]  It's going to be a consumer product eventually.
[1356.56 --> 1357.18]  That's their hope.
[1357.46 --> 1358.30]  A couple years after that.
[1358.34 --> 1361.00]  So right now there are 10 Spot Mini prototypes in existence.
[1361.58 --> 1363.66]  I guess not counting the murdered ones we just saw.
[1363.66 --> 1368.54]  And they're hoping to make one like a total of 100 by the end of this year.
[1368.98 --> 1369.92]  And then sell them next year.
[1370.16 --> 1375.96]  So they think it'll be useful for security patrols or helping construction companies keep tabs on what's happening at the building site.
[1376.68 --> 1377.76]  So security overnight.
[1379.22 --> 1379.70]  Okay.
[1379.98 --> 1381.52]  So security patrol pretty much.
[1381.52 --> 1384.42]  And you can get specialized attachments for different types of jobs.
[1384.74 --> 1385.04]  Yeah.
[1385.68 --> 1388.34]  I like the idea of it auto-following someone with a camera.
[1389.24 --> 1389.68]  That's cool.
[1392.06 --> 1392.98]  Paramilitary company.
[1393.10 --> 1394.88]  What would happen if you put little roller skates on each foot?
[1395.34 --> 1395.74]  Private.
[1398.96 --> 1401.26]  Just like how you troll a normal dog.
[1401.26 --> 1401.56]  Yeah.
[1401.98 --> 1403.14]  Putting socks on it.
[1403.30 --> 1403.72]  It's just like.
[1404.10 --> 1405.32]  I don't want this.
[1405.82 --> 1406.52]  Please stop.
[1407.48 --> 1408.50]  That's super cool though.
[1408.50 --> 1410.64]  What else do you want to talk about?
[1412.58 --> 1413.92]  You want to talk about this tickets thing?
[1414.40 --> 1414.72]  Yes.
[1414.86 --> 1417.92]  This is kind of a low tech thing?
[1419.48 --> 1419.88]  Yeah.
[1420.00 --> 1423.38]  But it's a problem that plagues a lot of people that are probably watching right now.
[1423.38 --> 1425.42]  Here's the problem with tickets.
[1427.10 --> 1430.40]  There's a big economic problem with ticket sales.
[1430.54 --> 1433.38]  Freakonomics, the podcast, did a sweet episode about this actually.
[1433.38 --> 1439.02]  When you go to buy concert tickets, the price of those concert tickets actually isn't driven
[1439.02 --> 1441.46]  by normal capitalist market dynamics.
[1441.76 --> 1445.00]  This was supposed to buy WM Groom AK on the form.
[1445.18 --> 1445.42]  Yeah.
[1445.52 --> 1446.52]  Who's a baller.
[1446.62 --> 1449.92]  And I like him even more now that I know he's a Nine Channels fan like I am.
[1450.10 --> 1452.80]  Because anyone who likes Nine Channels likes it a lot.
[1453.56 --> 1456.48]  Anyway, tickets are basically too cheap.
[1456.70 --> 1459.78]  Because artists want all their fans to be able to come and see them.
[1459.78 --> 1465.02]  If they were priced accordingly, like just by supply and demand, they'd probably be a
[1465.02 --> 1465.72]  lot more expensive.
[1466.22 --> 1471.16]  And they are a lot more expensive when people are able to scalp them, which they're easily
[1471.16 --> 1472.18]  able to do with bots.
[1472.56 --> 1478.22]  And so in order to reduce the number of bots scalping tickets, the band Nine Inch Nails or
[1478.22 --> 1483.82]  Trent Reznor has made the decision on their upcoming tour this fall to not sell any tickets
[1483.82 --> 1485.12]  online at all.
[1485.28 --> 1486.00]  They're going old school.
[1486.24 --> 1488.30]  You have to go and line up and buy them.
[1488.30 --> 1490.52]  And you can't even line up overnight or anything like that.
[1490.62 --> 1492.32]  You can't line up prior to 8 a.m.
[1492.52 --> 1496.62]  You have to just like show up and it's like a mob of people and then organize yourself in
[1496.62 --> 1496.92]  a line.
[1497.02 --> 1499.38]  Or maybe even a lottery system they talked about.
[1499.44 --> 1504.40]  Some venues, maybe the employees just come out and go, okay, like you, you, you, you,
[1504.40 --> 1505.14]  you're at the front.
[1505.26 --> 1506.30]  And it's just like random.
[1507.06 --> 1510.86]  Because just because they don't sell online doesn't mean there won't be scalpers, right?
[1511.10 --> 1511.30]  Yeah.
[1511.86 --> 1514.12]  Scalpers can just pay someone 20 bucks to stand there.
[1514.56 --> 1516.82]  There is a limit of four tickets per person.
[1516.82 --> 1519.40]  Hopefully that will reduce the scalping.
[1520.74 --> 1521.14]  Okay.
[1521.60 --> 1523.36]  I don't think that'll completely solve it.
[1523.46 --> 1525.06]  It won't, but it'll, it'll make a dent.
[1525.30 --> 1525.62]  Yeah.
[1526.32 --> 1527.68]  It's, it's, it's interesting.
[1527.86 --> 1533.02]  This has been really frustrating with like, so my, my dad and my group of friends have
[1533.02 --> 1537.16]  been going to PAX Prime since I was like 14 or something or 15.
[1537.16 --> 1537.66]  I don't remember.
[1537.76 --> 1539.20]  We've been going for a very long time.
[1539.20 --> 1545.06]  When we first started going, you could walk up and go to the desk and buy a ticket and
[1545.06 --> 1545.64]  walk in.
[1546.00 --> 1548.10]  Cause there, there wasn't enough fans.
[1548.70 --> 1556.44]  And now for PAX West, like PAX Prime, as it, as I know it, um, they sell out in seconds.
[1556.44 --> 1561.06]  And like, they do this crazy queuing thing and there's limits per person.
[1561.06 --> 1564.36]  And like, they do IP lock and like all this crazy stuff.
[1564.42 --> 1565.06]  Doesn't matter.
[1565.22 --> 1566.40]  Completely gone immediately.
[1566.40 --> 1569.56]  And there's an insane amount of scalping just outside of PAX.
[1569.58 --> 1572.86]  There's like many people scalping stacks of tickets every single year.
[1573.24 --> 1575.42]  And there's an insane amount of scalping online.
[1575.58 --> 1580.68]  There is a really nice community online where there's a bunch of different communities that
[1580.68 --> 1582.36]  sell them at cost.
[1582.56 --> 1583.04]  Okay.
[1583.04 --> 1584.38]  Because it's like, Oh, I bought too many.
[1584.44 --> 1586.04]  My friend can't go, whatever, that kind of stuff.
[1586.34 --> 1589.70]  I suspect those communities have a whole bunch of people in them.
[1590.30 --> 1591.76]  Just buying them and scalping them.
[1591.88 --> 1592.12]  Yeah.
[1592.22 --> 1597.06]  But, but I do know a lot of people that have gotten tickets at cost that needed them from
[1597.06 --> 1597.52]  those communities.
[1597.52 --> 1598.98]  So it is working to a certain degree.
[1598.98 --> 1599.66]  So that's cool.
[1600.02 --> 1606.66]  But like, it really sucks when me and my friends who have been going since PAX was really small
[1606.66 --> 1612.96]  and like barely a convention are now struggling to be able to go, even though we've
[1612.96 --> 1614.14]  been loyal this whole time.
[1614.36 --> 1616.54]  It's just like, Oh man, that kind of sucks.
[1616.70 --> 1618.14]  We still make it every year.
[1618.22 --> 1620.22]  We somehow make it, but it's just.
[1620.28 --> 1621.64]  Well, you can always pay a bunch more.
[1622.18 --> 1622.42]  Yeah.
[1622.92 --> 1623.04]  Yeah.
[1623.22 --> 1628.32]  We, I don't think we've had to do like, Oh, we have to buy like two single days or something
[1628.32 --> 1628.54]  like that.
[1628.54 --> 1634.12]  We've never had to buy like entire sets of tickets for every person from scalpers.
[1634.22 --> 1635.02]  We've never had to do that.
[1635.02 --> 1640.28]  There are other approaches rather than going full stone age that have been experimented
[1640.28 --> 1640.46]  with.
[1640.54 --> 1644.24]  One of them is basically kind of verified.
[1644.58 --> 1648.62]  You buy your ticket, you pay for it, but you don't really have it until you show up with
[1648.62 --> 1652.32]  your identification with the credit card that bought the tickets.
[1652.40 --> 1655.24]  Then you're let in and they print the tickets for you at that time.
[1656.52 --> 1659.82]  There's problems with that though, because you can't, you want there to be a secondary market.
[1659.82 --> 1664.58]  You know, you don't, you want to be able to buy them the week before cause you just found
[1664.58 --> 1666.16]  out or like you're visiting that city.
[1666.50 --> 1666.62]  Yeah.
[1666.80 --> 1668.32]  You want to be able to buy online.
[1668.64 --> 1670.72]  Like Nine Channels fans are diehards.
[1671.28 --> 1672.04]  People travel.
[1672.22 --> 1674.58]  Once at a concert, by the way, I've seen them five times.
[1674.70 --> 1680.96]  Once at a concert, I was there and there was a lady who had followed them across Europe.
[1681.08 --> 1682.50]  She'd seen them like 28 times.
[1682.72 --> 1685.10]  She had a stack of picks, four tambourines.
[1685.36 --> 1688.72]  She got an autograph from them and then got that autograph tattooed on her body.
[1688.72 --> 1689.70]  Like she was insane.
[1689.82 --> 1694.02]  Like people want to be able to see, oh, they're not coming to Vancouver, but they're going
[1694.02 --> 1694.56]  to Seattle.
[1694.82 --> 1696.20]  I'm going to buy a ticket for Seattle.
[1696.94 --> 1697.30]  Yeah.
[1697.32 --> 1703.16]  But I'm not going to drive out there and get in a non-line on the hopes that I can buy a
[1703.16 --> 1705.34]  ticket and then drive out there again for the show.
[1705.76 --> 1705.92]  Yeah.
[1705.98 --> 1708.30]  There's really no like great solution.
[1710.64 --> 1711.38]  And it sucks.
[1712.98 --> 1714.02]  I love the quote here.
[1714.06 --> 1714.78]  Speaking of sucks.
[1715.70 --> 1716.76]  What does he say here?
[1717.18 --> 1718.84]  We decided to try something different.
[1718.84 --> 1721.24]  That will also likely suck, but in a different way.
[1721.72 --> 1725.80]  We're hoping many of you will be happy with results while some may do what they always
[1725.80 --> 1726.80]  do and bitch about it.
[1727.56 --> 1727.76]  Yeah.
[1727.82 --> 1729.76]  Like there's and there's no other way to say it.
[1729.84 --> 1730.54]  He's trying something.
[1731.54 --> 1732.88]  It's probably not going to completely.
[1733.00 --> 1734.62]  It definitely won't completely work.
[1734.62 --> 1738.86]  I think I think for them, they're just going to have to try to like weigh the noise.
[1739.00 --> 1739.64]  It's trade offs.
[1739.82 --> 1740.00]  Yeah.
[1740.24 --> 1744.98]  And just like see how much less or more negative their new solution is.
[1745.08 --> 1747.22]  It's not and they're never going to have like a perfect solution.
[1747.34 --> 1749.04]  There was one other solution that's been tried.
[1749.14 --> 1751.36]  I believe I take a master called verified fan.
[1751.58 --> 1752.18]  You ever heard of that?
[1752.62 --> 1752.84]  No.
[1753.52 --> 1757.42]  It's I believe they take a certain number of tickets or maybe certain sections.
[1757.42 --> 1763.10]  And what you do is you have to register like ahead of time to kind of a community forum
[1763.10 --> 1767.26]  that'll be on in this case Ticketmaster's website where you have to do all these different
[1767.26 --> 1769.26]  things that signal that you're a true fan.
[1769.48 --> 1771.64]  You've got to engage with so many posts.
[1772.04 --> 1773.04]  You've got to like.
[1773.04 --> 1775.92]  I think that's basically it.
[1775.98 --> 1776.50]  Like you're on.
[1776.64 --> 1777.66]  It's like a process.
[1777.80 --> 1778.02]  Okay.
[1778.14 --> 1779.78]  To verify yourself.
[1780.00 --> 1781.52]  It's not just I log in and buy.
[1781.62 --> 1783.92]  See that that almost makes me kind of happy.
[1784.00 --> 1788.56]  And like something that I've wanted from PAX for a long time is like, okay, so I've bought
[1788.56 --> 1791.48]  tickets to PAX West for like 12 years.
[1792.04 --> 1794.08]  It would be nice if you knew that.
[1795.04 --> 1795.44]  Yeah.
[1795.48 --> 1796.26]  But so have the scalpers.
[1796.46 --> 1797.18]  Let me buy another one.
[1797.18 --> 1798.72]  They have to know they scanned you in.
[1799.18 --> 1799.30]  Yeah.
[1799.30 --> 1806.20]  Or yeah, but then like maybe I have like a profile and scalpers could still do this.
[1806.26 --> 1810.20]  But I was going to say like I sign in at the event and I'm showing you like, yeah, I'm
[1810.20 --> 1811.24]  showing up every day.
[1811.40 --> 1811.98]  This is me.
[1812.12 --> 1813.98]  You can check me every time if you want.
[1814.16 --> 1819.44]  Like make some process that you can go through that gives you some form of elevated account.
[1819.48 --> 1823.28]  Well, even what you just described would introduce quite a bit of friction to scalpers because
[1823.28 --> 1827.22]  if you're scalping 10 tickets and then all those people arrive at like the same time and
[1827.22 --> 1830.02]  you can't wait in line 10 different times, you might.
[1830.66 --> 1831.38]  It would be harder though.
[1831.48 --> 1833.40]  Whatever introduces more friction.
[1833.64 --> 1838.94]  And even the waiting in line 10 different times thing though, like if you have to verify
[1838.94 --> 1840.50]  it by ID and stuff, they wouldn't be able to.
[1840.60 --> 1842.10]  They'd only be able to scalp one set of tickets.
[1843.54 --> 1844.98]  I actually got screwed by that once.
[1845.52 --> 1852.56]  I bought, we spent like over, no, I think it was 560 bucks for Red Hot Chili Peppers tickets
[1852.56 --> 1853.86]  for four of them.
[1853.86 --> 1857.84]  So and I bought them on Craigslist and they were printed out and they were black and white
[1857.84 --> 1861.68]  and the guy was super sketch and we didn't feel good about it.
[1861.82 --> 1867.74]  So my buddy was also texting the same person and after I bought them, he continued to text
[1867.74 --> 1867.94]  them.
[1868.20 --> 1869.12]  Hey, are they still available?
[1869.42 --> 1870.30]  Yeah, they sure are.
[1871.42 --> 1873.20]  Met up with them again and busted them.
[1873.84 --> 1878.56]  Didn't end up, we got like some collateral from the guy, but he ended up just forgoing it.
[1878.56 --> 1882.98]  Like we got his phone and stuff, but he is because we're like, we got your phone.
[1883.14 --> 1884.90]  Now you have to like give us a refund.
[1884.90 --> 1887.22]  And he's like, okay, I'll go get money out.
[1887.26 --> 1889.06]  I'll come back like tomorrow kind of thing.
[1889.08 --> 1889.76]  And he never did.
[1889.86 --> 1891.30]  And the cops didn't care at all.
[1891.40 --> 1895.90]  So we just had his crappy phone after and like, and his debit card or something like
[1895.90 --> 1896.02]  that.
[1896.04 --> 1897.94]  You took his phone from him?
[1898.00 --> 1898.08]  Okay.
[1898.08 --> 1898.76]  I wasn't there.
[1898.84 --> 1900.04]  I was, I happened to be traveling.
[1900.20 --> 1904.46]  I was, but my friends who also were part of this and who are also larger than I am,
[1904.46 --> 1907.14]  they confronted him and like had a stakeout and stuff.
[1907.18 --> 1907.52]  It was cool.
[1907.52 --> 1914.04]  But in the end, basically the deal is they could have sold these tickets a dozen times
[1914.04 --> 1919.30]  and actually ours could have worked if we were the first ones who showed up.
[1919.50 --> 1924.08]  Whoever gets their first and gets those tickets scanned, the rest are inactive after that.
[1924.66 --> 1925.42]  So that was a drag.
[1925.92 --> 1926.58]  What a guy.
[1927.26 --> 1930.38]  It's just so junk.
[1930.38 --> 1935.18]  I don't like it when people, when people prey on like the average person in general,
[1935.18 --> 1936.24]  but it sucks too.
[1936.26 --> 1939.24]  When someone's like so excited for something and they're going to like, they're going to
[1939.24 --> 1941.32]  fork out the money for this band that they really want to go see.
[1941.40 --> 1942.96]  And they're like, yes, I finally get to see them in concert.
[1942.96 --> 1947.90]  And then they get like screwed at the door and so bad that the person scanning their ticket
[1947.90 --> 1949.68]  is probably like, you're a terrible person.
[1949.82 --> 1950.48]  You know what I mean?
[1950.86 --> 1954.74]  And then you finally get in there and you're like, okay, that all sucked, but we're here.
[1955.00 --> 1958.72]  And then the whole show is just actually someone else doing this in front of you.
[1958.72 --> 1959.16]  Yeah.
[1960.36 --> 1960.80]  Holy.
[1961.98 --> 1963.02]  Kill yourselves.
[1964.62 --> 1967.74]  I don't want to be ageist, but young people are getting pretty bad at that.
[1968.84 --> 1974.30]  I've seen people, I've watched people just like, just continually hold the button down
[1974.30 --> 1977.64]  and contribute each one to their story and then watch it themselves.
[1978.22 --> 1979.36]  And then here's the thing.
[1979.44 --> 1983.82]  People, if you're the type of person that likes to take cell phone recordings for your Instagram
[1983.82 --> 1988.14]  or Snapchat or just for video at a concert, know this.
[1989.02 --> 1993.96]  Every other person in the world, when they log into their Snapchat or Instagram and they're
[1993.96 --> 1999.66]  watching a story and that story is a dark room with crackling music, they skip it, man.
[2000.00 --> 2001.04]  Nobody watches it.
[2001.38 --> 2001.70]  Nobody.
[2001.70 --> 2001.90]  Nobody.
[2002.26 --> 2005.02]  You're ruining the experience for everybody for nothing.
[2005.24 --> 2006.02]  Including you.
[2006.16 --> 2007.46]  You skip their stuff too.
[2007.66 --> 2008.30]  Almost certainly.
[2008.82 --> 2011.62]  There was one time I went to a Blink-182 concert.
[2011.84 --> 2014.68]  I was a ridiculous fan of Blink-182 for a really long time.
[2014.76 --> 2015.02]  Nice.
[2015.70 --> 2016.66]  Not their new stuff.
[2017.00 --> 2018.00]  Take off your pants and jacket.
[2018.10 --> 2018.30]  Yes.
[2018.30 --> 2018.74]  Change your life.
[2018.88 --> 2019.08]  Yes.
[2019.08 --> 2019.46]  For sure.
[2019.62 --> 2020.40]  And Enema of the State.
[2020.70 --> 2023.66]  And like, what was the album before that?
[2024.54 --> 2025.54]  They had one before that?
[2025.70 --> 2026.60]  They had two before that.
[2027.08 --> 2027.28]  See?
[2027.62 --> 2029.60]  I thought Enema of the State was like their first one.
[2029.70 --> 2029.88]  No.
[2030.04 --> 2032.24]  That was their first one where they were like a big deal.
[2032.58 --> 2032.92]  Whoa.
[2033.38 --> 2033.64]  Yeah.
[2033.78 --> 2034.74]  They also had a different drummer.
[2035.84 --> 2040.26]  Well, that makes sense because he really catapulted them.
[2040.56 --> 2040.74]  Yeah.
[2040.84 --> 2042.24]  Travis is kind of incredible.
[2043.02 --> 2044.12]  Let's go to the discography.
[2045.22 --> 2046.36]  Cheshire Cat and Dude Ranch.
[2046.74 --> 2047.22]  I told you.
[2047.22 --> 2048.04]  Two more.
[2048.04 --> 2049.30]  I knew of Dude Ranch.
[2050.00 --> 2050.16]  Yeah.
[2050.30 --> 2051.26]  Those were great.
[2051.42 --> 2051.84]  Oh, yeah.
[2051.88 --> 2054.94]  There's the album cover with the big, the ox's butt.
[2055.22 --> 2055.38]  Yeah.
[2055.38 --> 2055.78]  The rump.
[2056.18 --> 2056.38]  Yeah.
[2056.90 --> 2058.42]  I like the old punk stuff.
[2058.52 --> 2058.76]  Whatever.
[2059.18 --> 2060.38]  I finally got to go see them in concert.
[2060.58 --> 2061.82]  Was so freaking stoked.
[2062.32 --> 2064.94]  Travis gets like pulled up into the air.
[2065.16 --> 2068.64]  His drum platform gets elevated on these like big chords.
[2069.06 --> 2069.98]  And then they make it vertical.
[2069.98 --> 2070.32]  They did?
[2070.38 --> 2070.56]  Yeah.
[2070.64 --> 2070.78]  Okay.
[2070.82 --> 2071.90]  And he's like strapped in a thing.
[2072.02 --> 2072.70]  He's freaking.
[2072.70 --> 2075.52]  It was one of the coolest things I've like ever seen.
[2075.60 --> 2077.60]  And I did like pull my phone out.
[2077.66 --> 2079.52]  But I recorded like low.
[2080.32 --> 2081.92]  The worst video that's ever existed.
[2082.08 --> 2083.44]  Just because I was like, I know it's going to suck.
[2083.52 --> 2085.20]  But I want to just like be able to remember it.
[2085.40 --> 2085.60]  Mm-hmm.
[2085.60 --> 2086.66]  And that's, yeah.
[2087.10 --> 2087.38]  So.
[2087.48 --> 2088.44]  I don't think I sent it to anyone.
[2088.44 --> 2088.84]  Two questions.
[2089.48 --> 2090.90]  Did you watch that video again?
[2091.02 --> 2091.66]  I did actually.
[2091.96 --> 2092.18]  Again?
[2092.18 --> 2093.38]  And I deleted it immediately.
[2093.70 --> 2093.90]  Oh.
[2093.98 --> 2095.12]  Because it was completely useless.
[2095.20 --> 2097.80]  Do you think recording it pampered your experience?
[2097.98 --> 2098.18]  No.
[2098.18 --> 2099.28]  Okay.
[2099.78 --> 2102.00]  Because again, I didn't, I didn't put it in front of my face.
[2102.22 --> 2102.48]  Mm-hmm.
[2102.52 --> 2104.00]  I didn't put it in front of anyone's face.
[2104.44 --> 2105.10]  Man, I went to the.
[2105.18 --> 2106.80]  I like pulled it out between a song.
[2107.50 --> 2107.86]  Okay.
[2108.18 --> 2109.64]  And like it was, it was, yeah, I didn't.
[2109.72 --> 2110.54]  There's a way to do it.
[2110.60 --> 2111.86]  And I think everyone gets one.
[2112.16 --> 2113.24]  The first one's free.
[2113.24 --> 2117.72]  I went to this folkloric ballet in Mexico City once.
[2118.20 --> 2118.52]  And this.
[2118.80 --> 2120.30]  Someone phone recorded that?
[2120.62 --> 2120.88]  No.
[2121.10 --> 2121.78]  I wish they had.
[2121.78 --> 2121.96]  Okay.
[2122.52 --> 2122.96]  iPad.
[2123.70 --> 2124.02]  Oh.
[2124.02 --> 2124.12]  Oh.
[2124.12 --> 2126.62]  I wish.
[2126.72 --> 2126.90]  Okay.
[2126.94 --> 2128.02]  If I was a dictator.
[2128.22 --> 2130.26]  If you live in one of those dictator countries.
[2131.84 --> 2135.88]  One upside is you can make sweet or whatever silly law you want.
[2135.94 --> 2140.14]  And if I was a dictator, my silly law would be if you see someone taking a photograph or
[2140.14 --> 2145.56]  a video with an iPad in public, you are completely allowed and culturally sanctioned to walk by
[2145.56 --> 2148.14]  and bitch slap that thing down to the ground.
[2148.28 --> 2149.18]  And they can't get mad.
[2149.32 --> 2150.58]  They can, they can look you.
[2151.26 --> 2151.50]  Ah.
[2151.50 --> 2151.98]  Ah.
[2153.48 --> 2154.32]  Caught me slipping.
[2154.62 --> 2155.48]  I hate it, man.
[2155.60 --> 2155.92]  Okay.
[2156.04 --> 2159.02]  This lady recorded the entire, I mean entire.
[2159.46 --> 2160.40]  I mean entire.
[2160.40 --> 2160.50]  Oh my God.
[2160.72 --> 2161.84]  Like an hour and a half video.
[2161.94 --> 2162.84]  Why wouldn't someone stop her?
[2163.58 --> 2165.56]  Because wouldn't that even, aren't you like not even allowed?
[2165.56 --> 2166.04]  I would have.
[2166.06 --> 2166.64]  I was seething.
[2166.80 --> 2167.82]  But there was a language barrier.
[2167.90 --> 2168.88]  My Spanish wasn't that good.
[2169.00 --> 2169.14]  Okay.
[2169.16 --> 2169.98]  I didn't even mean you.
[2170.10 --> 2171.66]  I meant like someone who was running.
[2172.02 --> 2172.52]  I don't know.
[2172.80 --> 2173.96]  We were at the kind of the top.
[2174.34 --> 2174.70]  Okay.
[2175.20 --> 2175.74]  There was no one.
[2176.48 --> 2178.08]  I talked to her after the show though.
[2178.40 --> 2179.30]  I embarrassed my wife.
[2179.40 --> 2180.42]  I went up to the lady.
[2180.42 --> 2182.40]  She, it turns out she spoke English.
[2183.54 --> 2184.84]  She wasn't Mexican actually.
[2185.44 --> 2190.82]  And I, I said, I just wanted you to know that you ruined the entire show for me.
[2191.08 --> 2191.96]  You ruined it.
[2192.62 --> 2194.04]  And she was like, what?
[2196.20 --> 2196.60]  What?
[2196.60 --> 2199.22]  I was on crutches and stuff.
[2199.30 --> 2204.94]  So when I first, I got stabbed a few days before and I, I, I crutched up to her.
[2205.28 --> 2207.30]  And so she was, and I was like, excuse me.
[2207.36 --> 2209.56]  And so she was just like, how can I help you?
[2209.60 --> 2210.82]  Like, hello, who are you?
[2211.16 --> 2213.86]  And I was like, I hate you.
[2213.86 --> 2216.12]  Where did you get stabbed?
[2216.38 --> 2217.48]  In an Uber in Mexico city.
[2217.94 --> 2218.86]  Oh yeah.
[2219.34 --> 2220.06]  By the driver?
[2221.10 --> 2222.68]  No, he drove me to hospital.
[2223.18 --> 2223.62]  Oh, no.
[2223.66 --> 2226.92]  Like we were, uh, uh, we were stuck in traffic.
[2227.02 --> 2228.90]  It was broad daylight near a tourist area.
[2229.26 --> 2229.52]  Sorry.
[2229.58 --> 2231.02]  Just, you can't just like drop that.
[2231.24 --> 2233.38]  And yeah, it was a minor stabbing.
[2233.56 --> 2235.18]  We are stuck in traffic, right?
[2235.20 --> 2237.32]  When you're in gridlock, you can't move.
[2237.50 --> 2239.72]  And the mistake we made was that our windows were down.
[2239.96 --> 2241.42]  So they see a bunch of tourists.
[2241.76 --> 2242.50]  Windows are down.
[2242.72 --> 2247.04]  I'm sitting in the back and suddenly this, there's a guy talking to the driver at his
[2247.04 --> 2247.26]  window.
[2247.42 --> 2250.72]  So being in South America, I assume, okay, this guy's selling us something.
[2251.02 --> 2255.62]  And then I see that they're like arguing and like, he's got a knife and I'm like, oh,
[2255.64 --> 2256.70]  the driver's getting robbed.
[2256.90 --> 2259.56]  And then I'm like, oh, we're getting robbed.
[2259.74 --> 2266.02]  And by that time, uh, his partner, there was two of them had come to the other side and,
[2266.02 --> 2268.18]  but everyone had their windows down to a different degree.
[2268.30 --> 2269.56]  Mine was like all the way down.
[2270.02 --> 2271.58]  My buddy and I was behind the driver.
[2271.76 --> 2275.82]  My buddy in the passenger seat, his window was like this much down.
[2276.10 --> 2278.88]  And my wife's window was completely up and she was behind the driver.
[2280.18 --> 2280.86]  Excuse me.
[2281.52 --> 2283.08]  That was something to do with the power.
[2283.26 --> 2283.78]  What is it not?
[2287.44 --> 2287.84]  Okay.
[2288.84 --> 2294.66]  Anyway, so my, my friend at the front seat, uh, one of the assailants put his hand in
[2294.66 --> 2298.52]  that window gap and was like groping at his pockets to try to get his phone.
[2299.34 --> 2302.62]  And meanwhile, the guy on the driver's side came to the back.
[2302.62 --> 2303.56]  So you guys are stopped at a light?
[2303.78 --> 2304.94]  We're stopping gridlock traffic.
[2304.98 --> 2305.60]  Gridlock traffic.
[2305.90 --> 2309.26]  And the other guy came to the back and was like yelling at me.
[2309.46 --> 2312.28]  And my thought was like, why don't we just get out of the car and run away?
[2312.44 --> 2313.76]  Like, they're not going to chase us.
[2313.80 --> 2315.40]  There's like a crowd of people everywhere.
[2315.40 --> 2318.92]  Like, let's just exit the vehicle while they're like trying, like yelling at us.
[2318.92 --> 2324.98]  So I moved over toward my wife, um, but couldn't open the door because it's like locked because
[2324.98 --> 2325.62]  the car is moving.
[2326.44 --> 2331.92]  And basically I didn't, I was probably this far from him from like the window.
[2332.02 --> 2336.58]  Like I'm in the middle seat and I couldn't understand what he was saying, but I now know
[2336.58 --> 2338.76]  it was like, give me the stuff or I'm going to stab you.
[2339.76 --> 2342.84]  So what he did was he reached, he didn't want to hurt me.
[2342.96 --> 2344.70]  And by the way, this guy was like 19 tops.
[2344.70 --> 2349.18]  He reached in and like started stabbing at my legs and he got me just above the knee
[2349.18 --> 2351.58]  and it went in like a half inch, like nothing.
[2352.12 --> 2353.66]  And, uh, it didn't hurt.
[2353.96 --> 2356.38]  It, it kind of feels like it sounds.
[2356.84 --> 2357.70]  That makes sense.
[2357.78 --> 2358.34]  Kind of just like.
[2362.32 --> 2362.76]  Okay.
[2363.00 --> 2365.04]  And I was just like, ah, God damn it.
[2365.08 --> 2370.10]  So then I grabbed a backpack that we had and I threw the backpack at him and that backpack
[2370.10 --> 2372.04]  did contain a DLSLR camera.
[2372.04 --> 2378.16]  Uh, the one only piece of cashmere I owned and don't own since like a sweater, like a
[2378.16 --> 2379.00]  two pairs of sunglasses.
[2379.00 --> 2380.34]  We got like a decent haul.
[2380.72 --> 2382.96]  And by the way, insurance never ended up claiming it.
[2382.96 --> 2386.22]  Cause it was one of those situations where your insurance would go up and it wasn't worth
[2386.22 --> 2386.42]  it.
[2386.76 --> 2389.02]  So he got that, but he didn't get our passports.
[2389.50 --> 2392.48]  Oh, I had just engaged or just become engaged.
[2392.96 --> 2397.36]  I proposed my wife like the week before and the photos, like I took a photo of her right
[2397.36 --> 2401.64]  after I took it, after I proposed to her and she was like teary eyed and had the ring.
[2401.64 --> 2405.50]  You know, so those kinds of sacred photos were gone, which was probably the biggest drag,
[2405.72 --> 2406.86]  but we still had our passports.
[2407.60 --> 2410.40]  And I just got my wife to give me her sweater and like tied her on the leg.
[2410.40 --> 2413.96]  And then we took, it took us like 45 minutes to get to the hospital.
[2414.12 --> 2414.90]  Cause you're in gridlock.
[2415.00 --> 2416.46]  Oh, it was so chaotic, man.
[2416.50 --> 2417.30]  It was like traffic.
[2417.42 --> 2419.66]  We had a police escort, but they were still inept.
[2419.84 --> 2422.44]  We went to this first hospital and decided that wasn't a good one.
[2422.44 --> 2425.00]  Like we were outside the hospital.
[2425.10 --> 2427.52]  I'm like, are they going to come and like bring something?
[2428.42 --> 2430.72]  And then like 20 minutes later, like, we're just going to go to another one.
[2430.78 --> 2431.30]  Like, okay.
[2432.50 --> 2436.48]  We got to drive down the wrong side of the road with like police sirens blaring and stuff.
[2436.50 --> 2437.90]  And this Uber driver's just like, woo.
[2438.98 --> 2439.90]  It was insane.
[2440.12 --> 2440.82]  Yeah, it was pretty cool.
[2441.10 --> 2445.64]  My cousin, speaking of, I've never been stabbed, but my cousin, when he was in high school,
[2445.64 --> 2451.58]  there was another kid at the high school, I guess, who his gang initiation was to stab someone.
[2451.98 --> 2452.28]  God.
[2452.34 --> 2454.70]  So he just like walked up to my cousin after school and stabbed him.
[2455.10 --> 2457.02]  My cousin pulled the knife out and stabbed him back.
[2457.18 --> 2457.68]  Hell yeah.
[2457.86 --> 2459.54]  Which is like not really smart.
[2459.72 --> 2460.32]  What is that?
[2460.40 --> 2461.48]  Like wounds and stuff.
[2461.74 --> 2462.12]  That's badass.
[2462.30 --> 2464.28]  But it was, yeah, my cousins are insane.
[2464.30 --> 2465.70]  He's got that fight response.
[2465.80 --> 2466.16]  That's sweet.
[2466.24 --> 2466.68]  Killer instinct.
[2466.80 --> 2467.22]  Good for him.
[2467.50 --> 2469.64]  I got the fright response.
[2469.76 --> 2470.62]  The flight response.
[2472.08 --> 2472.86]  God damn it.
[2472.88 --> 2473.86]  Just take the bag.
[2473.86 --> 2476.86]  Well, I couldn't have ran if I wanted.
[2477.02 --> 2477.54]  Yeah, I know.
[2477.74 --> 2478.00]  I did want to.
[2478.00 --> 2478.16]  Yeah.
[2478.48 --> 2483.68]  It felt like you had the like disappointed response, I guess.
[2484.14 --> 2485.44]  Like, why is this what's happening?
[2485.86 --> 2487.14]  Just take the stupid thing.
[2487.22 --> 2488.80]  I appreciate that he stabbed my legs.
[2489.60 --> 2490.64]  Instead of like your chest?
[2490.76 --> 2494.76]  It was so, yeah, he could have just been like, I don't value human life.
[2495.08 --> 2495.94]  Like, there's your neck.
[2496.08 --> 2499.20]  Or like, I mean, he could have slipped and got my femoral artery.
[2499.20 --> 2504.02]  But the damage that was incurred was worth it for the story.
[2504.34 --> 2504.44]  Right.
[2504.58 --> 2506.14]  Like, now I've been stabbed.
[2506.14 --> 2506.34]  Do you have a scar?
[2506.84 --> 2507.06]  Yeah.
[2507.32 --> 2507.54]  Cool.
[2508.08 --> 2511.46]  I'd show you, but I have to take my pants off and the camera won't even see it.
[2511.66 --> 2512.88]  So, yeah, it's not worth it.
[2513.08 --> 2513.42]  Yeah, it's not worth it.
[2513.42 --> 2515.22]  Twitch is going to be like, get off the platform.
[2515.46 --> 2516.86]  It's just, it's too much stuff.
[2517.16 --> 2518.88]  Okay, so the show's almost over.
[2519.08 --> 2519.82]  Oh, yeah, sponsors.
[2520.12 --> 2521.36]  We should probably do sponsors.
[2521.64 --> 2521.80]  Yeah.
[2521.80 --> 2525.16]  Let's start with Sauvage Jerky.
[2526.80 --> 2528.48]  Sauvage Jerky.
[2529.08 --> 2531.54]  Which I'm sure they're going to be okay with me saying it that way.
[2531.64 --> 2534.68]  Because they're amazing people with amazing stuff.
[2535.38 --> 2536.64]  It's beef jerky.
[2536.76 --> 2537.72]  It tastes amazing.
[2539.00 --> 2543.78]  It's like, I don't know how to describe it very well.
[2543.88 --> 2545.14]  It's just really good beef jerky.
[2545.34 --> 2546.46]  Savage AF.
[2547.20 --> 2547.94]  There's a whole bunch.
[2548.00 --> 2549.08]  There's 13 different flavors.
[2549.22 --> 2550.48]  My favorite one is this one.
[2550.48 --> 2552.34]  It's just the standard moho.
[2552.54 --> 2557.90]  You can also get crazy stuff like Reaper, which is like Carolina Reaper and a fused beef jerky.
[2558.04 --> 2559.28]  There's bacon versions.
[2559.78 --> 2564.44]  So there's like sriracha bacon, if you're one of those many, many people that are obsessed with sriracha.
[2565.02 --> 2565.64]  Or bacon.
[2565.76 --> 2569.08]  Or bacon, which is like, that's a pretty big crossover, I think.
[2569.84 --> 2572.34]  There's a Venn diagram there with like mostly over up.
[2572.60 --> 2572.80]  Yeah.
[2573.82 --> 2578.72]  They say it's jerky made with the best ingredients and it doesn't have nitrates or preservatives.
[2578.72 --> 2582.76]  And their goal was to create a snack that was full of flavor and spice that wasn't bad for you.
[2583.40 --> 2584.02]  It's good.
[2584.36 --> 2586.94]  If you go to their website and use code LTT.
[2587.08 --> 2587.88]  Their website's right here.
[2588.26 --> 2592.14]  If you use code LTT, you save 10% off of all of their products.
[2592.22 --> 2593.58]  I'm trying to see how many I can hold at once.
[2593.66 --> 2595.16]  As you can see.
[2595.24 --> 2596.20]  They have a lot of products.
[2596.20 --> 2597.78]  They have, yeah, a lot of them.
[2598.92 --> 2599.28]  There.
[2600.08 --> 2602.46]  Some that are great for your mouth, some that are bad for your butt.
[2603.08 --> 2603.90]  Just the Reaper one.
[2603.96 --> 2604.30]  That one.
[2605.02 --> 2605.90]  Have you had that one?
[2606.02 --> 2606.58]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2606.58 --> 2607.76]  I did it on the WAN show.
[2607.98 --> 2609.10]  Slowly disarm you here.
[2609.74 --> 2613.30]  It was, uh, I tried to play it cool like it wasn't that spicy, but it was spicy.
[2613.88 --> 2616.66]  It was spicy enough you'll remember.
[2617.12 --> 2617.82]  Yeah, yeah.
[2618.36 --> 2620.18]  Do you have, are these from, no they're not.
[2620.36 --> 2620.70]  There you go.
[2620.70 --> 2622.66]  These are Laser James glasses.
[2622.82 --> 2624.00]  These are non-Spectrum glasses.
[2624.26 --> 2629.96]  And if you don't want to, like, look like Laser James over there and you want to reduce,
[2629.96 --> 2635.16]  uh, blue light from monitors to, like, help you fall asleep at night and all that.
[2635.16 --> 2635.90]  My alter ego.
[2636.80 --> 2637.56]  Reading James.
[2637.74 --> 2638.72]  Reading James.
[2639.48 --> 2641.18]  You can get Spectrum glasses.
[2641.36 --> 2642.52]  You can go to the website right here.
[2642.60 --> 2644.78]  Save 10% by using code Linus.
[2645.48 --> 2649.84]  They say, and this is totally a thing, that staring at a monitor all day can be hard on your eyes
[2649.84 --> 2651.36]  and also make it tougher to fall asleep.
[2651.44 --> 2653.78]  The fall asleep thing is, is important to me.
[2654.12 --> 2659.30]  Uh, using software solutions like F.Lux or Twilight won't give you the same type of filtering
[2659.30 --> 2662.74]  that these kind of things can, which is pretty cool.
[2662.92 --> 2664.12]  Uh, they're stylish.
[2664.32 --> 2664.84]  I don't know.
[2665.18 --> 2666.22]  I think yours look pretty good.
[2666.78 --> 2667.26]  Uh.
[2667.30 --> 2668.76]  I'm very hit or miss with glasses.
[2668.94 --> 2670.58]  I don't think these look great on me, but I.
[2670.74 --> 2672.08]  Those ones look great on Colton.
[2672.36 --> 2672.60]  Yeah.
[2672.78 --> 2675.20]  I have had Spectrum glasses that have looked good on me too.
[2675.80 --> 2677.84]  Um, and I think those look good on you.
[2677.84 --> 2683.18]  Um, I was wearing these for a while before I got like prescription glasses.
[2683.36 --> 2684.46]  Were those the specific ones?
[2684.48 --> 2686.32]  These are the ones I was wearing at my desk for a while.
[2686.40 --> 2687.72]  And sometimes I wore them just to look cool.
[2688.06 --> 2688.26]  Yeah.
[2688.58 --> 2689.18]  They're pretty sweet.
[2689.34 --> 2689.72]  Is it working?
[2690.40 --> 2691.20]  I think so.
[2691.52 --> 2693.24]  Uh, they have low color distortion.
[2693.44 --> 2693.58]  Yeah.
[2693.64 --> 2694.44]  That's totally a thing.
[2694.48 --> 2699.18]  There's, there's a few of these that will like really hardcore make it look like everything's
[2699.18 --> 2699.44]  yellow.
[2699.68 --> 2699.98]  Yeah.
[2700.00 --> 2701.28]  These don't.
[2701.28 --> 2703.02]  And there's, there's, you can tell when you take them off.
[2703.02 --> 2703.26]  Technically.
[2703.26 --> 2703.50]  Yeah.
[2703.58 --> 2706.44]  There is technically some, but it's not very noticeable.
[2706.44 --> 2707.78]  Like white stuff still looks white.
[2707.90 --> 2712.00]  There are, there are some competitor glasses that I've worn that do make things look yellow.
[2712.04 --> 2718.20]  And these are super light, which I like because you can just, you know, whatever you want.
[2718.46 --> 2722.64]  They are primarily focused around Canadian and U.S. markets in terms of like shipping
[2722.64 --> 2727.04]  and all that kind of stuff, but they are expanding into Europe and they do offer international
[2727.04 --> 2727.60]  shipping.
[2727.78 --> 2729.22]  They're expanding into Europe now.
[2729.42 --> 2729.66]  Yeah.
[2729.76 --> 2730.38]  I didn't know that.
[2730.52 --> 2730.72]  Yeah.
[2730.80 --> 2731.74]  You know, I went to school with the founder.
[2732.44 --> 2732.66]  Oh.
[2732.90 --> 2733.66]  He's a nice guy.
[2734.04 --> 2734.92]  His name's also James.
[2735.24 --> 2735.48]  Oh.
[2735.48 --> 2736.32]  He's a nice guy.
[2736.44 --> 2737.02]  Buy his glasses.
[2737.38 --> 2737.60]  Cool.
[2738.08 --> 2738.76]  I didn't know that.
[2739.38 --> 2745.14]  And if, if you're thinking about expanding into Europe, maybe think about FreshBooks.
[2745.54 --> 2746.14]  FreshBooks.
[2746.40 --> 2753.46]  That might simplify your accounting and free up enough of your finances to help you do
[2753.46 --> 2755.08]  that little push you need.
[2755.20 --> 2759.92]  I don't know what market you might be in that that would be applicable to, but it might make
[2759.92 --> 2760.24]  sense.
[2760.36 --> 2760.92]  Hell of a segue.
[2761.18 --> 2761.44]  Yeah.
[2761.76 --> 2763.06]  It was, it was fantastic.
[2763.06 --> 2767.92]  If you do, I know one thing that's really applicable to our audience is people who might
[2767.92 --> 2770.64]  be doing like little tech things on the side.
[2770.64 --> 2776.00]  Like I know a lot, like Linus and I, and most people that I know that are really into
[2776.00 --> 2780.02]  computers at one point in time, really early on in their life, they were like the person
[2780.02 --> 2785.42]  that all their friends knew that fixed and built and repaired and maintained all the computers
[2785.42 --> 2786.46]  around.
[2786.46 --> 2788.08]  And you can turn that into a business.
[2788.70 --> 2792.08]  I did it for a few little shops there for a while and whatnot.
[2792.50 --> 2795.08]  I even had like an official company name and all that kind of stuff.
[2795.08 --> 2799.80]  And if you really don't want to like manage invoices, manage expenses, make sure people
[2799.80 --> 2800.64]  are paying you.
[2800.70 --> 2805.64]  If you have, uh, if you're not doing like cash deal under the table every single time,
[2805.68 --> 2808.36]  if you want to be a little bit more legit, you want to allow people to take time to pay
[2808.36 --> 2808.82]  for stuff.
[2809.18 --> 2811.56]  Uh, you can do that with FreshBooks, which is great.
[2811.90 --> 2814.10]  Uh, you can create invoices super fast.
[2814.16 --> 2815.40]  You can check if people have seen them.
[2815.40 --> 2820.42]  You can manage all your expenses, which for me is a big deal because I hate doing little
[2820.42 --> 2821.74]  micro paperwork things.
[2821.90 --> 2823.50]  It's one of my like biggest pet peeves.
[2823.84 --> 2824.12]  Oh yeah.
[2824.18 --> 2827.24]  It's just feels like a waste of time all the time and then I'll put it off for way too
[2827.24 --> 2827.48]  long.
[2827.76 --> 2829.26]  So yeah, it's helpful.
[2829.76 --> 2830.10]  FreshBooks.
[2830.36 --> 2830.86]  Super cool.
[2831.04 --> 2832.02]  Check them out right here.
[2832.78 --> 2833.86]  And, uh, yeah.
[2834.58 --> 2838.70]  Put WAN in the how did you hear about us section and use offer code WAN and go to freshbooks.com
[2838.70 --> 2841.18]  slash WAN and everything will, everything will go.
[2841.18 --> 2845.20]  We're working on getting the slash and ah implemented, but it's not there yet.
[2845.20 --> 2846.04]  So for now it's slash WAN.
[2846.04 --> 2846.58]  It's going to take some time.
[2846.78 --> 2846.88]  Yeah.
[2847.02 --> 2847.26]  You know?
[2847.50 --> 2847.68]  Yeah.
[2849.18 --> 2849.50]  Okay.
[2849.58 --> 2850.20]  Linus isn't coming.
[2850.42 --> 2851.22]  Let's talk about Nintendo.
[2851.50 --> 2851.82]  I was going to say, I don't think he's going to make it.
[2851.92 --> 2852.12]  Yeah.
[2852.24 --> 2852.82]  He's not coming.
[2852.96 --> 2853.56]  Let's do it.
[2853.68 --> 2853.88]  So.
[2854.10 --> 2855.38]  We'll put him in the thumbnail though still.
[2855.96 --> 2856.44]  You know?
[2856.74 --> 2857.78]  Get more views that way.
[2857.92 --> 2862.14]  I wanted to do when we both did, we both did this like weird arm thing at one point
[2862.14 --> 2863.28]  in time and I was going to use that.
[2863.28 --> 2864.56]  Oh, when we were talking about Boston Dynamics?
[2864.84 --> 2865.52]  Maybe that was it.
[2865.68 --> 2865.84]  Yeah.
[2865.84 --> 2866.32]  I don't remember.
[2866.86 --> 2869.52]  Um, I just remember being like, I have to mentally log that.
[2869.62 --> 2871.24]  I was like somewhere around three quarters through the show.
[2871.24 --> 2873.88]  Uh, where is it?
[2874.00 --> 2874.08]  So.
[2874.46 --> 2878.62]  Nintendo shares new details about its Nintendo Switch online service, which is going to
[2878.62 --> 2879.64]  launch this September.
[2881.72 --> 2882.16]  So.
[2882.16 --> 2882.88]  So cool.
[2883.08 --> 2883.80]  It's kind of good.
[2883.88 --> 2884.68]  It's kind of bad.
[2884.90 --> 2885.08]  Oh.
[2885.36 --> 2892.08]  Um, the, the, the reason why I'm going to say it's kind of bad is because as you may or
[2892.08 --> 2898.98]  may not know the online right now is at no cost and this will make it so that the online
[2898.98 --> 2900.04]  is at a cost.
[2900.20 --> 2901.82]  And what might that cost be?
[2901.98 --> 2903.36]  We have it written down here.
[2903.44 --> 2904.04]  We do.
[2904.38 --> 2908.34]  Uh, a year for 25 bucks, 24 99.
[2908.70 --> 2914.24]  So just, just about two bucks a month for an individual.
[2914.62 --> 2914.96]  Okay.
[2914.96 --> 2916.22]  That's Canadian pricing.
[2916.40 --> 2916.98]  Uh, yes.
[2917.16 --> 2918.48]  U S pricing is 20 bucks.
[2918.48 --> 2921.84]  So you, U S pricing for one year is 20 bucks.
[2921.96 --> 2926.30]  U S pricing for three months is eight bucks and U S pricing for one month is four bucks,
[2926.30 --> 2930.60]  but Canadian it is 25, 10 and five respectively.
[2930.96 --> 2933.14]  There's also family membership pricing.
[2933.24 --> 2937.38]  So that covers eight people and they can even be on different Nintendo systems.
[2937.52 --> 2940.44]  And that in Canadian is 45 bucks a year.
[2940.56 --> 2942.48]  And 35 in American.
[2942.48 --> 2947.18]  So if there's a way to use that with just you and seven friends that you're not actually
[2947.18 --> 2949.50]  related to, you might be able to, that'll be sweet.
[2949.60 --> 2950.16]  It'd be really cheap.
[2950.18 --> 2953.22]  People do that all the time with Spotify and, and schnaz, right?
[2953.22 --> 2953.54]  Yes.
[2953.80 --> 2954.58]  All that kind of stuff.
[2955.46 --> 2961.62]  I am totally not on Linus's family plan for something similar to that.
[2962.34 --> 2964.52]  Um, what can it do?
[2964.64 --> 2966.52]  Well, it, it gives you a few things.
[2966.52 --> 2971.90]  Uh, it includes some NES games like ice climber, legend of Zelda, balloon fight, soccer, tennis,
[2972.04 --> 2972.24]  Mario.
[2972.32 --> 2974.90]  I love it when games used to be able to be just called soccer or tennis.
[2975.06 --> 2975.34]  Yeah.
[2975.50 --> 2981.58]  Uh, Mario bros, super Mario bros, Dr. Mario, super Mario bros three and donkey Kong.
[2981.58 --> 2985.74]  And 10 more will also launch with the service will be announced at a later date.
[2985.84 --> 2987.24]  So that is completely novel.
[2987.40 --> 2988.86]  That's totally new for those games.
[2988.96 --> 2991.28]  There's never before been online play with those games.
[2991.32 --> 2991.74]  Is that correct?
[2992.82 --> 2993.74]  That's what I understood.
[2995.62 --> 2996.14]  Uh,
[2996.14 --> 2999.48]  any that will, uh, okay.
[2999.62 --> 3004.70]  So with emulators, you could, well, yeah, well, you could come up with emulators.
[3004.70 --> 3005.70]  What can't you do with an emulator?
[3005.78 --> 3006.14]  Yeah.
[3006.42 --> 3010.80]  But so any that originally supported multiplayer will still support multiplayer and will support
[3010.80 --> 3014.34]  online multiplayer, which is cool because it'll be like a really easy way to do so.
[3014.54 --> 3018.72]  Doing online co-op with emulators has always been a little jank, but doable.
[3019.56 --> 3025.02]  Um, I don't think it's very known if you cancel your subscription, if you'll still have access
[3025.02 --> 3026.50]  to those games, but I doubt it.
[3027.18 --> 3028.90]  Uh, back to the multiplayer thing.
[3028.96 --> 3030.06]  Uh, that's definitely new.
[3030.12 --> 3033.80]  It's what I've got written here is depending on the game, players can engage in online competitive
[3033.80 --> 3037.24]  co-op or multiplayer, or this is probably new for all of them.
[3037.74 --> 3039.22]  Take turns controlling the action.
[3039.22 --> 3040.86]  Yes.
[3040.86 --> 3045.08]  So this was, uh, this was something that I noticed as well, which is really cool where
[3045.08 --> 3047.04]  I think they call it like pass the controller.
[3047.64 --> 3048.02]  Yeah.
[3048.02 --> 3052.26]  It says friends can even watch each other play single player games and pass the controller
[3052.26 --> 3053.06]  at any time.
[3053.24 --> 3057.18]  So you can watch your friend play a game through the switch.
[3057.26 --> 3062.32]  That's, that's a cool idea because I think with Twitch, we've, we've like sort of lost
[3062.32 --> 3067.32]  something, which is like, I was playing a game with a friend the other day and we both stream
[3067.32 --> 3070.54]  on Twitch, but we didn't want to stream at that point in time.
[3070.54 --> 3075.56]  And I commented where like, I, I wish I could see your screen right now because like I was,
[3075.62 --> 3077.58]  I was dead in a match and there's no spectate.
[3077.88 --> 3078.06]  Yeah.
[3078.14 --> 3078.24]  Yeah.
[3078.24 --> 3081.70]  So I was like, I wish you were like streaming, but I guess just to me.
[3082.22 --> 3084.50]  What if, and that's like not super a thing.
[3084.50 --> 3088.82]  Do you think when, once you pass the controller, you still have control of where the controller
[3088.82 --> 3089.30]  goes?
[3089.46 --> 3092.14]  Or do you think if I pass it to you?
[3092.34 --> 3092.36]  Yeah.
[3092.46 --> 3093.32]  I want to be able to yank it.
[3093.36 --> 3097.02]  Cause imagine how fun that would be if you're watching Ninja or you're, you're watching your
[3097.02 --> 3098.92]  favorite streamer and they're like, Hey, I'm going to the bathroom.
[3098.92 --> 3102.56]  And then they just pass their controller to some random person in the stream.
[3102.64 --> 3104.70]  And buddy's just like, Oh no.
[3104.88 --> 3109.08]  Two million people get to watch them play Fortnite, not Fortnite, but a Switch game.
[3109.16 --> 3109.28]  Yeah.
[3109.28 --> 3109.50]  Yeah.
[3109.82 --> 3110.68]  That would be pretty sweet.
[3110.78 --> 3111.44]  That'd be really sick.
[3111.44 --> 3111.74]  Actually.
[3112.28 --> 3114.10]  I don't think it'll work in that way.
[3114.36 --> 3117.98]  But if I remember correctly, Mixer does that Microsoft streaming service.
[3118.06 --> 3122.78]  You can do stuff like that, but I could be super extremely off base there.
[3122.92 --> 3126.92]  I've, I've, I know there's some form of thing that can work that way, but it might've been
[3126.92 --> 3129.80]  a specific game that someone happened to be playing on Mixer.
[3129.88 --> 3131.00]  It could be completely unrelated.
[3131.24 --> 3131.60]  I don't know.
[3132.00 --> 3133.62]  Uh, but I think that idea is super cool.
[3133.78 --> 3135.42]  I like the idea of sharing the controller too.
[3135.52 --> 3138.96]  So like, if you're like, uh, dude, look, I'm so stuck on this freaking boss.
[3139.04 --> 3139.38]  Oh yeah.
[3139.42 --> 3142.26]  And then you like play the boss for a while and he's like, yo, give me a shot.
[3142.46 --> 3144.02]  You just like pass the control over and he gets to like try it.
[3144.02 --> 3145.70]  What about a new form of smurfing?
[3146.40 --> 3147.00]  You're like, yeah, man.
[3147.00 --> 3148.36]  Just one B one me.
[3148.36 --> 3150.22]  And then there's like someone spectating.
[3150.32 --> 3152.80]  You're like, send it across.
[3153.26 --> 3154.08]  There it is.
[3154.26 --> 3154.84]  Are we live?
[3154.88 --> 3155.42]  There's the thumbnail.
[3155.42 --> 3156.00]  We are live.
[3157.14 --> 3158.88]  Uh, that's the end of the show.
[3159.00 --> 3160.02]  We're going to stop now.
[3160.42 --> 3161.22]  You're behind the mic.
[3161.74 --> 3163.70]  Oh, it's technically not.
[3163.74 --> 3166.30]  If you don't want it to be, we went live a little late.
[3167.00 --> 3167.58]  Oh, okay.
[3167.64 --> 3168.66]  Can I come in and do a topic?
[3169.04 --> 3169.24]  Yeah.
[3169.30 --> 3169.74]  All right.
[3169.86 --> 3170.30]  I'll go home.
[3170.96 --> 3172.02]  You can't take these though.
[3173.24 --> 3174.68]  Thank you for keeping my seat warm.
[3175.40 --> 3177.66]  Ah, oh, that is a warm seat.
[3177.66 --> 3180.52]  You could say it's a warm ass seat.
[3180.76 --> 3181.20]  Oh my.
[3181.50 --> 3183.24]  Because it's an ass seat.
[3183.44 --> 3184.46]  So do I get one of these shirts?
[3185.22 --> 3186.48]  Yeah, you can have one if you want.
[3186.56 --> 3186.88]  Nice.
[3187.04 --> 3187.76]  I'm actually pretty excited.
[3187.78 --> 3188.72]  I designed it myself.
[3188.96 --> 3189.78]  Yeah, I saw that.
[3190.46 --> 3193.00]  The writing is like precisely messy.
[3193.40 --> 3194.56]  It's like perfectly messy.
[3194.64 --> 3194.96]  It's good.
[3194.96 --> 3195.30]  Thank you.
[3195.38 --> 3195.72]  I like this.
[3195.72 --> 3196.20]  Thank you.
[3196.40 --> 3197.28]  I like the show too.
[3197.36 --> 3200.64]  I wanted to say when I first saw this in person, Riley even asked me about it.
[3200.66 --> 3201.64]  He's like, so what do you think of the set?
[3201.66 --> 3204.14]  I was like, ah, but it looks really good on camera.
[3204.48 --> 3204.78]  Cool.
[3204.92 --> 3205.16]  Good.
[3205.28 --> 3206.80]  Did, oh, did Riley jump on the show at all?
[3206.96 --> 3207.14]  No.
[3207.14 --> 3211.70]  Oh, I kind of thought he was going to come in and sort of talk about working here and
[3211.70 --> 3211.92]  stuff.
[3212.08 --> 3212.54]  He may have been.
[3212.58 --> 3214.10]  He can take me out if he wants.
[3214.68 --> 3216.74]  No, he can't because he carpools with James.
[3216.90 --> 3217.28]  Okay.
[3217.48 --> 3217.78]  Oh.
[3218.42 --> 3219.20]  Oh, okay.
[3219.42 --> 3220.32]  James is his ride.
[3220.54 --> 3221.20]  Well then, okay.
[3221.24 --> 3222.42]  Bye, James and Riley.
[3222.60 --> 3222.86]  Bye.
[3224.60 --> 3226.62]  Do we have any cool topics to talk about?
[3226.62 --> 3230.28]  We tried to leave some for you and then you didn't show up.
[3230.44 --> 3231.80]  I was busy.
[3231.94 --> 3234.88]  I was busy running a laptop at five gigahertz.
[3235.48 --> 3235.82]  Oh.
[3236.98 --> 3237.38]  Okay.
[3237.58 --> 3239.30]  Is it ridiculous or is it reasonable?
[3239.98 --> 3241.64]  Oh, it's not reasonable.
[3241.98 --> 3242.12]  Okay.
[3242.72 --> 3244.08]  Do you want any spoilers?
[3244.48 --> 3245.62]  Is it the too big?
[3245.62 --> 3247.84]  It is.
[3247.96 --> 3250.06]  It involves server fans.
[3250.06 --> 3254.56]  Oh, no.
[3255.50 --> 3255.94]  Okay.
[3256.02 --> 3258.44]  You got to do a follow-up video where you go and use it in public.
[3260.08 --> 3261.74]  And just see how people react.
[3261.80 --> 3266.30]  It involves an external variable voltage power supply that's about this big.
[3266.42 --> 3266.76]  Totally.
[3267.12 --> 3268.26]  You should still do it.
[3268.52 --> 3270.22]  It's louder than a hairdryer.
[3270.40 --> 3270.80]  Totally.
[3271.46 --> 3273.30]  I would love to.
[3273.38 --> 3274.62]  I would watch that video.
[3274.70 --> 3275.18]  Oh, man.
[3275.24 --> 3276.16]  You got to name it.
[3277.14 --> 3281.78]  And then like bring it back by like using the blah in public.
[3281.98 --> 3282.66]  It's terrible.
[3283.66 --> 3285.36]  Anyways, we haven't talked about.
[3285.44 --> 3287.56]  Have we talked about renting out your graphics card for mining?
[3287.56 --> 3288.18]  We left that.
[3288.30 --> 3289.02]  Let's do that.
[3289.08 --> 3289.26]  Okay.
[3289.36 --> 3294.24]  So the original article here is from Tech Radar and it was posted by apparently no one on the forum.
[3294.34 --> 3295.64]  James is apparently on it.
[3295.64 --> 3296.80]  Morgan MLG man.
[3297.06 --> 3308.16]  A German company has announced Games from Space, which borrows your GPU for cryptocurrency mining purposes and then gives you free PC games in return.
[3308.82 --> 3314.80]  So you pick any game you want, watch a progress bar slowly tick up as your GPU is used for the company's mining efforts.
[3316.00 --> 3320.02]  The faster your graphics card, the quicker the process towards getting a new game.
[3320.60 --> 3323.82]  So here's a really important thing to point out.
[3325.64 --> 3329.82]  Games that you pay for on your electricity bill are not free.
[3330.80 --> 3331.20]  Yeah.
[3331.92 --> 3334.58]  But I think a lot of kids are going to think they are.
[3335.52 --> 3339.24]  This is totally going to be kids using their computers to screw over their parents.
[3339.24 --> 3339.58]  Yeah.
[3339.58 --> 3342.76]  Or people in dorms or whatever else.
[3342.76 --> 3354.38]  So it's, I will give Games from Space credit for being devious enough to figure out one of the biggest challenges of cryptocurrency mining.
[3354.38 --> 3358.04]  And that is power and actually cooling as well.
[3358.04 --> 3364.02]  So by distributing the computing around the globe, it's effectively kind of not their problem.
[3364.02 --> 3374.84]  And everyone who's running on their network of computers is going to be contributing such a small amount to it that it's not really going to be, like it's not going to be noticeable.
[3376.96 --> 3377.48]  Yeah.
[3377.70 --> 3381.88]  Some of the games are actually newer big name affairs like PUBG or Grand Theft Auto V.
[3381.88 --> 3387.50]  So with a GTX 1070, either of those would take you about a month of mining.
[3388.24 --> 3389.88]  You can get Dirt 3 in a day apparently.
[3391.16 --> 3396.06]  Now obviously you won't be able to mine while you are actually playing games.
[3396.26 --> 3409.86]  And from my experience with software like NiceHash, it might not necessarily cooperate that well when you launch applications that want the GPU back.
[3409.86 --> 3414.10]  Like I've, that was actually why I stopped running folding on my gaming system.
[3414.62 --> 3421.16]  Because I was running into weird issues even if folding at home was technically giving the GPU back.
[3421.28 --> 3421.42]  Yeah.
[3421.68 --> 3421.84]  Yeah.
[3422.04 --> 3424.06]  I was still not running correctly.
[3424.20 --> 3426.00]  So I would watch out for...
[3426.00 --> 3427.32]  We had the same problems at ours.
[3427.48 --> 3430.10]  I would watch out for pretty much everything about this.
[3431.84 --> 3432.74]  What else we got?
[3433.06 --> 3433.50]  Yeah.
[3434.14 --> 3437.16]  So there's, there was a few topics.
[3437.28 --> 3437.54]  Where are we?
[3437.54 --> 3439.14]  The, the, that.
[3439.86 --> 3444.34]  Qualcomm is finally making a smartwatch chip.
[3444.42 --> 3447.42]  So this was originally posted by Edward the Weeb on the forum.
[3447.94 --> 3453.84]  Hey, James didn't tell you you're not getting a ride and that you can't come and say hi.
[3454.86 --> 3455.34]  Okay.
[3455.38 --> 3457.52]  Well, let's just burn through this really quickly.
[3457.52 --> 3459.92]  And then you guys can ask Riley some questions in Twitch chat.
[3460.46 --> 3461.26]  Does that sound pretty good?
[3461.44 --> 3461.66]  Yeah.
[3461.66 --> 3462.18]  Okay.
[3462.28 --> 3464.82]  So Qualcomm is making a smartwatch chip.
[3465.02 --> 3470.56]  AI Wear OS watches that come out today have little option but to use Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 2100 from February 2016.
[3471.18 --> 3474.00]  Some have argued this is holding the entire Wear OS platform back.
[3474.32 --> 3475.12]  It is pretty slow.
[3475.56 --> 3483.06]  Qualcomm has announced a watch focused silicon this fall alongside a flagship device with several partners set to release Wear OS watches based on the new chips by the holidays.
[3483.06 --> 3488.72]  The third generation processors will be designed from the ground up for a no compromises smartwatch experience.
[3490.28 --> 3491.98]  So better battery life, smaller watches.
[3492.36 --> 3494.84]  Apparently designing the chips to work more effectively with always on displays.
[3495.04 --> 3496.96]  And a smartwatch is first and foremost a watch.
[3497.04 --> 3497.84]  It needs to look good.
[3497.92 --> 3498.72]  It needs to be sleek.
[3498.90 --> 3500.40]  It needs to look good when I'm looking at it.
[3500.42 --> 3502.14]  These are all just looking good.
[3502.20 --> 3502.74]  This is a quote.
[3502.92 --> 3503.54]  It has nothing to do with.
[3503.54 --> 3504.28]  Why would you say that?
[3504.32 --> 3504.58]  Yeah.
[3504.68 --> 3505.80]  It has nothing to do with the chip.
[3505.96 --> 3506.28]  All right.
[3506.84 --> 3507.32]  Thank you very much.
[3507.32 --> 3509.28]  Oh, also rumor Google preparing Pixel smartwatch.
[3509.44 --> 3510.86]  Probably related to that last one.
[3510.86 --> 3512.76]  You're talking really fast, Linus.
[3512.82 --> 3513.22]  You are.
[3513.28 --> 3513.56]  Okay.
[3513.64 --> 3514.04]  I'm sorry.
[3514.18 --> 3515.74]  Are you okay?
[3516.94 --> 3520.48]  Nine inch nails to fight ticket bots by not selling tickets online.
[3521.66 --> 3522.02]  Yeah.
[3522.10 --> 3523.00]  We already covered that one.
[3523.00 --> 3523.42]  Oh, all right.
[3523.52 --> 3526.62]  We covered that one because James thought you wouldn't want to talk about it.
[3526.68 --> 3527.92]  So this guy works here now.
[3528.02 --> 3531.66]  I didn't want to make you stop doing the actual news part.
[3531.94 --> 3532.22]  Well, no.
[3532.28 --> 3532.60]  That's okay.
[3532.62 --> 3533.66]  We have a new news show.
[3534.12 --> 3534.72]  That's true.
[3534.96 --> 3535.20]  No.
[3535.34 --> 3536.60]  But a lot of people are concerned.
[3536.72 --> 3538.18]  They're like, don't stop doing the WAN show.
[3538.52 --> 3539.44]  It's not going to stop.
[3539.44 --> 3543.70]  Someone just said Central Park, but he misspelled the misspelling.
[3545.82 --> 3546.26]  What?
[3546.38 --> 3547.72]  He did Central Prack.
[3548.64 --> 3549.34]  Which is like.
[3549.34 --> 3549.54]  Hey, man.
[3549.70 --> 3550.60]  Central Prack.
[3551.16 --> 3552.54]  It's a meme for the people.
[3552.72 --> 3554.00]  You can make it your own.
[3554.74 --> 3556.84]  You want to put an R in there at the beginning?
[3556.96 --> 3557.48]  That's fine.
[3558.64 --> 3559.88]  Central Repack.
[3563.10 --> 3564.00]  It's Riley.
[3564.00 --> 3565.22]  Yeah.
[3566.22 --> 3567.06]  This is a.
[3567.26 --> 3569.16]  I'm having a hard time with this mic in the middle.
[3569.24 --> 3569.32]  Yeah.
[3569.38 --> 3569.72]  You know what?
[3569.76 --> 3570.38]  Why don't you.
[3570.50 --> 3571.26]  No, no, no, no.
[3571.26 --> 3571.80]  No, no, no.
[3571.80 --> 3572.12]  Please.
[3572.24 --> 3572.82]  No, I'm going to sit.
[3572.84 --> 3573.50]  I'm going to sit there.
[3574.52 --> 3575.28]  I'll sit here.
[3575.44 --> 3577.34]  I'll take a back seat.
[3577.50 --> 3578.16]  I'm just a boy.
[3579.94 --> 3580.54]  This is a.
[3580.54 --> 3581.80]  I'm just a small town boy.
[3581.92 --> 3584.16]  The last time I was on this show, I was a guest.
[3584.64 --> 3587.76]  Someone says, are you only hosting shows or are you doing other things at LMG as well?
[3589.06 --> 3589.96]  Well, I'm writing.
[3592.22 --> 3592.64]  What's this?
[3592.74 --> 3593.24]  What are you looking at?
[3593.62 --> 3594.12]  Oh, the audience.
[3594.44 --> 3595.02]  Oh, the set.
[3595.10 --> 3596.00]  They're on the camera over there.
[3596.80 --> 3598.08]  You gestured over here.
[3598.18 --> 3598.36]  Yeah.
[3598.74 --> 3599.80]  Oh, I thought you were gesturing that way.
[3599.86 --> 3600.16]  No, yeah.
[3600.16 --> 3600.80]  I mean, I built.
[3600.80 --> 3601.44]  Yeah, I guess.
[3601.56 --> 3602.62]  Well, I didn't build the set.
[3602.96 --> 3603.76]  I mean, I sort of did.
[3603.96 --> 3605.14]  A bunch of people built it.
[3605.72 --> 3608.04]  I've been working on this set for the past, like, month.
[3608.86 --> 3609.72]  I've been here for a month.
[3609.72 --> 3610.50]  Trying to give you some credit, man.
[3610.52 --> 3611.16]  Can I say that?
[3611.34 --> 3611.58]  Yeah.
[3611.58 --> 3616.12]  I've been here for like a month, and I've just been building the set and doing a bunch
[3616.12 --> 3619.16]  of stuff with Yvonne and Edsel.
[3619.82 --> 3620.14]  Yeah.
[3620.30 --> 3621.86]  It was hard work, guys.
[3622.62 --> 3623.44]  But I'm here.
[3626.36 --> 3629.08]  Everett asks, were you okay when NCIX went bankrupt?
[3629.60 --> 3630.52]  Was I okay?
[3631.40 --> 3631.82]  Yeah.
[3632.72 --> 3633.10]  Actually.
[3633.94 --> 3634.92]  Weren't you gone already?
[3634.94 --> 3636.92]  Yeah, I was gone by the time they had gone bankrupt.
[3636.92 --> 3640.68]  I had left and started with Secret Informant.
[3640.78 --> 3641.02]  Sorry.
[3641.28 --> 3641.54]  No.
[3641.58 --> 3641.98]  No, that's fine.
[3642.02 --> 3642.30]  I don't care.
[3642.36 --> 3643.24]  You can talk about Secret Informant.
[3643.32 --> 3643.58]  Yeah.
[3643.96 --> 3649.26]  So I went to do that, and then I was doing that for a while, and then we started talking.
[3650.22 --> 3651.02]  Yes, we did.
[3651.20 --> 3652.54]  Someone said, is Linus a terrible boss?
[3652.54 --> 3652.82]  And the news was born.
[3653.06 --> 3653.66]  He's asking.
[3654.28 --> 3655.66]  Someone's asking if Linus is a terrible boss.
[3655.66 --> 3657.78]  He's asking you specifically if Linus is a terrible boss.
[3658.58 --> 3661.02]  Well, you know, I've only been here for a minute.
[3661.06 --> 3662.04]  I can't tell yet.
[3662.04 --> 3662.50]  I know.
[3662.50 --> 3668.78]  No matter how I answer that question, I feel like it's going to seem insincere.
[3669.18 --> 3670.36]  Linus is a great boss.
[3671.00 --> 3672.40]  No, Linus is a terrible boss.
[3673.38 --> 3674.84]  Yeah, they both sound like lies.
[3674.84 --> 3681.08]  Is the show still a work in progress?
[3681.24 --> 3682.70]  Kind of seems cobbled together.
[3682.70 --> 3685.96]  It's definitely a work in progress still.
[3686.04 --> 3688.02]  We're still tweaking stuff.
[3688.08 --> 3689.76]  You said that on social media the other day.
[3690.14 --> 3695.44]  So if you guys have suggestions for how to change it, definitely let us know.
[3695.76 --> 3698.08]  We will read them, and we will take them into account.
[3699.06 --> 3700.44]  Yeah, it has its own Twitter handle.
[3701.32 --> 3701.88]  What is it?
[3702.08 --> 3703.92]  At TechLinkedYT.
[3704.68 --> 3706.06]  I think it's at TechLinkedYT.
[3706.06 --> 3706.68]  I think it's at TechLinkedYT.
[3706.68 --> 3707.80]  It might just be at TechLinkedYT.
[3708.96 --> 3711.76]  MazioSair says, please sell a t-shirt with that exact design.
[3712.48 --> 3713.78]  Yeah, we're doing it.
[3713.80 --> 3714.74]  I think that's the plan, right?
[3714.74 --> 3716.08]  It's actually available right now.
[3716.10 --> 3716.80]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[3716.90 --> 3717.98]  It was up really fast.
[3717.98 --> 3724.22]  Yeah, you've got to go to the LTT merch store because TechLinked is still too bitch mode to have its own merch store.
[3725.16 --> 3730.62]  It's no longer like Linus and I make a meme on when, and then four months later we have a shirt.
[3730.78 --> 3731.62]  It's like fast.
[3731.98 --> 3733.84]  Now memes turn into t-shirts immediately.
[3733.92 --> 3734.06]  Yeah.
[3734.12 --> 3736.78]  We actually have a dedicated graphic designer.
[3737.22 --> 3746.02]  So there's been, honestly, there's been so many moving parts getting this show started, getting him in here, getting all the design work done, getting the set built, all the negotiations.
[3746.02 --> 3747.28]  I really wish I could tell.
[3747.42 --> 3752.44]  You know most of the story behind the NCIX Tech Tips acquisition effort, right?
[3753.16 --> 3753.46]  Yes.
[3753.48 --> 3755.42]  Okay, that is strictly under NDA.
[3756.46 --> 3757.40]  Just so you know.
[3757.92 --> 3760.50]  It's too long of a story to tell anyways.
[3760.62 --> 3763.62]  10 out of 10, how crazy is it?
[3764.26 --> 3766.62]  I mean, it's insane.
[3766.78 --> 3767.22]  I had no...
[3767.22 --> 3781.78]  When we filmed the announcement video, I wrote the skit and then I wrote the end part and I'm like, okay, Linus, fill in the NCIX story.
[3781.98 --> 3784.48]  And I thought it was going to be like a couple paragraphs or something.
[3784.48 --> 3786.10]  It's like an essay.
[3786.22 --> 3788.14]  It was like four pages long or something.
[3788.70 --> 3789.44]  I was like, what?
[3789.52 --> 3790.16]  Well, you can't do that.
[3790.16 --> 3791.60]  And then he's like, no, we're doing the whole thing.
[3792.24 --> 3793.96]  Stinky Pete said, great to see you.
[3794.02 --> 3796.16]  Are you continuing the NCIX persona, i.e.
[3796.22 --> 3798.58]  Quick Bits, or are you trying to differentiate the show from the past?
[3798.58 --> 3801.92]  I mean, Central Park survived.
[3802.92 --> 3803.80]  So did Quick Bits.
[3803.88 --> 3804.32]  I tried.
[3805.60 --> 3807.24]  Well, I didn't know what else to call it.
[3807.36 --> 3809.52]  What should I call Quick Bits if not Quick Bits?
[3810.68 --> 3812.10]  Rapid Small Portions.
[3814.48 --> 3817.12]  Rapid Fire Small Portion News Stories Bits.
[3817.12 --> 3819.22]  No, I don't know.
[3819.46 --> 3822.70]  If you guys, I mean, there are some other names already.
[3822.86 --> 3825.30]  It's supposed to be a spiritual successor.
[3825.72 --> 3832.94]  So like, I saw some people leaving comments like, wow, you guys really captured the essence of Netlinked.
[3833.36 --> 3835.78]  And I'm kind of sitting there going, well, oh crap.
[3835.88 --> 3838.02]  We've got the same host and writing staff.
[3838.14 --> 3842.70]  We've got the same other host and sort of troll.
[3844.28 --> 3845.70]  Really captured the essence.
[3845.80 --> 3846.62]  How did you do that?
[3846.86 --> 3848.82]  How'd you make sure it was so true to the original?
[3849.50 --> 3850.76]  You called the original people.
[3851.12 --> 3852.28]  It's basically the original.
[3854.20 --> 3855.12]  Yeah, I don't know.
[3856.62 --> 3858.00]  What does Central Park mean?
[3858.86 --> 3859.10]  Ugh.
[3861.02 --> 3864.76]  If you don't want to answer the damn question, you're going to have to stop saying it.
[3865.22 --> 3866.50]  I do want to answer it.
[3866.52 --> 3868.84]  I just feel like it's just kind of a long story.
[3868.94 --> 3869.88]  So it's kind of a lengthy.
[3870.44 --> 3875.46]  It's an inside joke originating on Flight of the Conchords that me and my friend said all the time.
[3875.46 --> 3877.48]  And then I started saying it on Netlink Daily.
[3878.32 --> 3879.34]  And it kind of caught on, I guess.
[3879.34 --> 3880.76]  Top comment every video from there on.
[3880.96 --> 3881.18]  Yeah.
[3881.42 --> 3883.00]  That's not actually a very long story.
[3883.00 --> 3883.36]  I know.
[3883.62 --> 3885.08]  Well, I was just like, can I do it?
[3885.16 --> 3885.48]  Can I?
[3885.70 --> 3886.40]  I guess I did.
[3886.54 --> 3886.84]  Apparently.
[3886.84 --> 3888.56]  Quick Bits through and through.
[3888.82 --> 3893.70]  Someone said you will do, you said you will do not only tech, but until now it's only been tech.
[3893.78 --> 3894.30]  What's going on?
[3895.48 --> 3896.84]  I will not do only tech?
[3896.96 --> 3897.18]  Where?
[3897.48 --> 3897.86]  Who on what?
[3897.86 --> 3898.98]  Because it said STEM news.
[3899.12 --> 3900.02]  I remember that from the video.
[3900.80 --> 3901.62]  Oh, yeah.
[3901.62 --> 3901.66]  Yeah.
[3901.98 --> 3905.50]  So that's more of a bet hedging strategy.
[3906.22 --> 3915.58]  You know, like if some kind of like biomedical thing comes out, we don't want to end up in a stupid argument with people in the comments that that's not tech.
[3915.98 --> 3916.16]  Yeah.
[3916.20 --> 3919.02]  Because when it comes down to it, everything is tech.
[3919.18 --> 3920.06]  The wheel is tech.
[3921.36 --> 3921.64]  Eh.
[3923.10 --> 3923.72]  It is.
[3923.72 --> 3925.18]  It's super easy.
[3925.18 --> 3925.66]  Yeah, it is.
[3925.70 --> 3926.04]  Yeah, it is.
[3927.18 --> 3928.36]  I'm a contrarian.
[3929.42 --> 3935.44]  So that was actually a change that I made to the script where I kind of went, look, let's not paint ourselves into a box.
[3935.84 --> 3936.00]  Yeah.
[3936.06 --> 3936.92]  It's about STEM.
[3937.34 --> 3939.50]  That way it can be about basically anything.
[3939.50 --> 3940.04]  It can be about literally anything.
[3940.22 --> 3942.76]  If someone finds a new prime number, we can talk about it.
[3942.76 --> 3944.30]  Games doesn't really fit in there, though.
[3944.74 --> 3945.18]  Oh.
[3945.94 --> 3948.08]  What if we say it's STEM and gaming?
[3948.46 --> 3948.86]  Stegma.
[3949.04 --> 3950.94]  This news stems from.
[3950.94 --> 3954.06]  Geez.
[3959.32 --> 3959.88]  Okay.
[3960.42 --> 3962.22]  Moving on immediately.
[3962.94 --> 3966.16]  What do you hope to learn or improve working with Linus?
[3966.26 --> 3966.74]  Speaking of.
[3967.10 --> 3967.34]  Yeah.
[3967.94 --> 3975.62]  Well, I've already learned to kind of like fly by the seat of my pants as in like do it now.
[3975.78 --> 3976.42]  Do something.
[3976.54 --> 3977.04]  Get it done.
[3977.58 --> 3977.84]  You know?
[3977.84 --> 3979.44]  Yeah, you came in on your first day.
[3979.52 --> 3980.78]  Didn't have an email address.
[3980.94 --> 3984.06]  Didn't have like any passwords for anything.
[3984.26 --> 3985.32]  Didn't actually have an assignment.
[3985.48 --> 3989.36]  Because basically we had put the whole thing off for so long.
[3990.00 --> 3993.34]  Like Riley's start date was supposed to be like many weeks ago.
[3993.34 --> 3998.34]  I think I was looking at the emails and they started like February or March.
[3998.62 --> 3998.86]  Yeah.
[3999.10 --> 3999.32]  Yeah.
[3999.34 --> 4003.88]  And so what happened was we kept thinking we were going to get the channel.
[4004.46 --> 4006.34]  And then we were like, okay, here's your start date.
[4006.60 --> 4008.42]  And then we were like, oh, we weren't going to get it.
[4008.48 --> 4008.58]  Yeah.
[4008.58 --> 4009.94]  But we were just going to start our own channel.
[4010.10 --> 4010.68]  We were back to it.
[4010.78 --> 4012.24]  And you were like, just stay tuned.
[4012.66 --> 4013.54]  I'll get you an update.
[4013.62 --> 4014.54]  And I'm just like, okay, cool.
[4014.82 --> 4015.64]  And you're like, okay, yeah.
[4015.70 --> 4016.34]  Now this is happening.
[4016.94 --> 4017.96]  I'm just like, okay, yeah.
[4018.08 --> 4018.30]  All right.
[4018.30 --> 4023.50]  The amount of people that got chat banned immediately after you made that joke was insane.
[4023.62 --> 4024.88]  There's like a whole block.
[4025.40 --> 4025.56]  What?
[4025.56 --> 4027.72]  It's above this, but just like, oh, yeah.
[4028.12 --> 4028.48]  Jeez.
[4031.66 --> 4036.84]  Anyway, so there was a whole thing where we were just like, okay, screw it.
[4037.40 --> 4043.56]  We've got some pre-show preparation to do like a set and figuring out branding and all this stuff.
[4044.10 --> 4045.44]  Riley can help with that.
[4045.44 --> 4049.86]  Let's just get him in here and honestly, it was a good move.
[4049.92 --> 4058.20]  It was actually Nick's idea because it really put the pressure on me to start making videos with this person that I'm paying all the time.
[4059.18 --> 4063.04]  We hired a writer and host to build a set.
[4063.14 --> 4065.60]  Maybe not the best decision.
[4066.22 --> 4069.70]  I did learn a lot of my management strategies from NCIX.
[4073.00 --> 4075.42]  So I came in here and it was like coming home.
[4076.44 --> 4078.86]  People are asking, will you do WAN Show 2?
[4080.12 --> 4081.46]  Will I do WAN Show 2?
[4081.86 --> 4084.52]  I mean, I guess that's up to you guys.
[4084.96 --> 4085.34]  I don't know.
[4085.50 --> 4089.60]  We actually haven't really decided how we're going to best utilize Riley.
[4089.82 --> 4091.40]  I mean, I think I'm screwing it up right now.
[4091.52 --> 4093.34]  So if you're taking that as an example.
[4093.34 --> 4097.38]  Yeah, I mean, we brought him in as someone who's multi-talented.
[4097.66 --> 4106.28]  Something that some people wouldn't know is he was basically running the entire NCIX channel by himself by the end of it.
[4106.28 --> 4110.36]  And like arguably it wasn't its finest, you know, moment.
[4110.70 --> 4111.84]  But rude.
[4112.06 --> 4117.86]  He was literally by himself writing, filming, editing, posting.
[4118.34 --> 4118.98]  At the end.
[4118.98 --> 4121.14]  Actually posting it to YouTube.
[4121.74 --> 4125.68]  Answering comments about, yo guys, what's going on with my order?
[4125.86 --> 4127.34]  Is that whole place imploding?
[4127.44 --> 4128.22]  What's going on?
[4128.22 --> 4128.50]  Yeah.
[4129.50 --> 4130.24]  In the comments.
[4130.24 --> 4137.24]  So we brought Riley in knowing that we wanted to bring back a spiritual successor to Netlinked.
[4137.48 --> 4149.08]  Knowing that the best way to do that would be to bring back the sort of tag team that I think, nothing against anyone else who ever worked on Netlinked.
[4149.08 --> 4160.98]  But the tag team that I think refined the Netlinked format made it what it was and was kind of the golden age of Netlinked in terms of audience reception, in terms of viewership.
[4161.18 --> 4161.36]  Yeah.
[4161.80 --> 4166.96]  Well, originally, because Netlinked was Netlinked Weekly that you did on the NCX channel.
[4167.12 --> 4167.26]  Way back.
[4167.26 --> 4175.24]  And it was like a longer show and it wasn't really, I guess you guys edited it a bit, but like that was before I came launch.
[4175.24 --> 4175.52]  Yeah.
[4175.64 --> 4178.54]  And then when we came on, we were like, hey, we're going to make it a daily show.
[4178.54 --> 4179.54]  And then like, yeah.
[4179.54 --> 4181.10]  And then you guys took it totally serial.
[4181.72 --> 4185.28]  And then I came in when I was like a contractor and didn't really care anymore.
[4185.60 --> 4191.84]  And that was, that was, that whole casual feel of Netlinked was not manufactured.
[4192.20 --> 4194.78]  It was because I actually didn't give any cares.
[4195.36 --> 4197.18]  I would roll in on a Friday.
[4197.36 --> 4199.00]  That's definitely the feeling I got.
[4199.00 --> 4205.08]  At like 10.30, we would bang out all the videos that had to be done for that week.
[4205.18 --> 4206.18]  Yeah, like four at one time.
[4206.20 --> 4207.96]  And then I'd be like, yeah, it's two o'clock.
[4207.96 --> 4208.60]  Boom.
[4208.76 --> 4209.18]  See ya.
[4209.34 --> 4209.92]  You're out of there.
[4210.40 --> 4213.18]  And I'd come back here and host WAN Show often late.
[4213.50 --> 4213.68]  Yeah.
[4214.46 --> 4214.82]  Yeah.
[4214.92 --> 4218.84]  And then we were kind of like, hey, Linus, so we wrote this funny bit.
[4219.02 --> 4221.52]  Could you put the hat on and like do the voice for the thing?
[4221.54 --> 4222.80]  And he's like, no, I'm doing this.
[4222.88 --> 4223.04]  Boom.
[4223.30 --> 4223.92]  Okay, guys.
[4224.06 --> 4225.22]  So I'm Linus.
[4225.38 --> 4225.90]  Brr, brr, brr.
[4226.46 --> 4227.80]  And I'd like get stuff wrong.
[4227.82 --> 4229.30]  But that's not, that's okay.
[4229.56 --> 4229.66]  Fine.
[4229.66 --> 4232.12]  I'd get stuff wrong, right?
[4232.18 --> 4235.30]  Like I'd read the script wrong, but I would just like keep going through it because I
[4235.30 --> 4235.84]  was in a hurry.
[4236.08 --> 4236.24]  Yeah.
[4236.64 --> 4238.72]  And that was where that kind of stuff.
[4238.76 --> 4239.78]  And people liked it.
[4239.82 --> 4240.14]  Mm-hmm.
[4240.14 --> 4242.44]  So, so we ended up with-
[4242.44 --> 4244.22]  So like yelling at people from off screen and stuff.
[4244.32 --> 4244.48]  Yeah.
[4244.56 --> 4248.52]  That was all, that was actually the only feedback that I gave them on their writing.
[4248.84 --> 4249.14]  Hmm.
[4249.40 --> 4250.62]  Was during the show.
[4250.62 --> 4251.46]  During the show.
[4251.48 --> 4252.26]  Telling them stuff.
[4252.32 --> 4253.24]  That was a stupid bit.
[4253.30 --> 4253.82]  Don't do it.
[4253.86 --> 4254.06]  Okay.
[4254.10 --> 4254.76]  What's the next one?
[4254.76 --> 4262.72]  So, so, so the goal was to, to, to, to, that seemed like the best way to, I don't forget
[4262.72 --> 4266.82]  where I was going with this, but it seemed like the best way to, to, to make this happen
[4266.82 --> 4271.52]  was to bring back sort of what I see as sort of the heart and soul of it and then just inject
[4271.52 --> 4272.34]  it into something new.
[4272.40 --> 4274.40]  And I forget what the point of getting there was.
[4274.52 --> 4276.62]  I'm going to take a few different questions and lump them into one.
[4276.82 --> 4277.00]  Yeah.
[4277.00 --> 4278.82]  How do you guys expect the channel to perform?
[4279.00 --> 4282.38]  Some people are asking comparatively to TechQuickie, but I don't really think that's super relevant.
[4282.38 --> 4287.26]  But like the, like, how do you expect the growth of the channel to go?
[4288.30 --> 4290.40]  I feel like I'm a bad person to answer that question.
[4290.54 --> 4291.74]  You guys know so much about.
[4292.18 --> 4292.44]  Okay.
[4292.44 --> 4293.88]  I think this is general to.
[4294.06 --> 4299.20]  So my expectation for the channel was, or not my expectation.
[4299.20 --> 4307.50]  My goal was as sort of a, a, a salty, well, sort of thing.
[4307.50 --> 4317.04]  My goal was for TechLinked to basically immediately have as good or better viewership than the latter
[4317.04 --> 4319.86]  episodes of TechLinked on the NCIX comm channel.
[4320.42 --> 4324.20]  Anything beyond that, I consider to be a smashing success.
[4324.78 --> 4331.06]  And as for the sales team, anything above a hundred thousand views of video should be
[4331.06 --> 4333.30]  quite easy for them to bring in sponsors for.
[4333.30 --> 4338.42]  Or if they can bring in sponsors on a consistent basis, we will, we will comfortably cover,
[4338.42 --> 4345.98]  um, Riley's, uh, Riley's cost and the extra editing courses that we need.
[4346.20 --> 4350.74]  And the lunch, um, um, we don't do free lunch here, but good try.
[4352.90 --> 4357.10]  So as long as we can bring sponsors in, we will comfortably cover our overhead is basically
[4357.10 --> 4358.18]  where I was going with that.
[4358.18 --> 4362.16]  Even, even like the square footage, the equipment, like all those things that you have to factor
[4362.16 --> 4363.26]  into the cost of a show.
[4363.48 --> 4368.60]  And I mean, if, if your standard was that they outperform like the later episodes of
[4368.60 --> 4370.44]  NetLinked, it's already done that.
[4370.56 --> 4370.74]  So.
[4371.40 --> 4371.68]  Yeah.
[4371.72 --> 4374.02]  I think there's a bit of a honeymoon period going on right now though.
[4374.14 --> 4376.76]  Well, but it could continue forever perfectly.
[4377.30 --> 4378.90]  It could continue forever perfectly.
[4379.26 --> 4381.12]  I mean, honestly, I think we're going to get there.
[4381.12 --> 4386.62]  I think, I think that not, I think we've actually gotten a lot of feedback already from community
[4386.62 --> 4389.68]  members saying there really was a gap there.
[4390.26 --> 4392.06]  NetLinked had a purpose.
[4392.44 --> 4394.62]  This, this source fed style.
[4395.08 --> 4396.04]  Tech news thing.
[4396.22 --> 4402.04]  And I was kind of surprised when, when we stopped and people were like, there's no other like
[4402.04 --> 4406.80]  really quick, like tech news shows about like, you know, centering on like PC stuff.
[4406.86 --> 4407.40]  And there isn't.
[4407.44 --> 4410.24]  And a lot of people are trying to hit the 10 minute minimum and all this kind of stuff.
[4410.24 --> 4410.56]  Yeah.
[4410.92 --> 4412.54]  But we're not interested in that.
[4412.60 --> 4414.10]  We've never cared about the 10 minute minimum.
[4414.40 --> 4418.16]  A lot of people, we've released videos that are 10 minutes and one second or whatever.
[4418.38 --> 4422.32]  And a lot of people are like, aha, in the comments.
[4422.54 --> 4422.84]  Gotcha.
[4423.06 --> 4426.08]  And I'm kind of sitting there going, you don't understand how this works.
[4426.28 --> 4430.98]  The 10 minute mark is only important if you run a mid roll AdSense spot.
[4431.46 --> 4432.18]  And we don't.
[4432.18 --> 4432.98]  And we don't.
[4433.08 --> 4433.32]  So.
[4433.42 --> 4433.90]  My ride is leaving.
[4433.90 --> 4434.44]  So it doesn't matter.
[4434.56 --> 4435.32]  Oh, your ride is leaving.
[4435.42 --> 4436.06]  I need to leave.
[4436.06 --> 4436.80]  You can go.
[4437.48 --> 4438.86]  Thank you for joining us.
[4438.96 --> 4439.86]  Thanks for having me.
[4439.94 --> 4440.16]  Yeah.
[4440.40 --> 4441.06]  This is cool.
[4441.18 --> 4441.84]  It's been fun.
[4442.54 --> 4443.30]  Can I do this again?
[4443.56 --> 4445.04]  I remember where I was going with that.
[4445.22 --> 4446.52]  He's very multi-talented.
[4446.66 --> 4451.68]  So we brought him in knowing that he was multi-talented thinking that we would just find.
[4452.70 --> 4453.08]  We'd find.
[4453.18 --> 4454.52]  I'm just like a natural on camera.
[4454.72 --> 4457.44]  I know everything that you need to do on like a set.
[4457.52 --> 4457.96]  Thank you.
[4458.42 --> 4459.06]  Thank you.
[4459.06 --> 4461.60]  So right now.
[4461.60 --> 4467.24]  His time is not completely occupied just by writing TechLinked and hosting it.
[4467.30 --> 4469.66]  And in some cases, he won't even be hosting it.
[4469.82 --> 4471.46]  It's only a three times a week show.
[4471.64 --> 4474.46]  And I'll probably be hosting somewhere between a third and half of them.
[4474.92 --> 4477.02]  Riley will be doing between a third and half of them.
[4477.48 --> 4479.34]  And we might have other people jump in.
[4479.42 --> 4480.62]  James has expressed interest.
[4480.74 --> 4482.00]  Colton has expressed interest.
[4482.00 --> 4485.40]  And we'd like to have it actually be quite diverse.
[4486.50 --> 4488.94]  Maybe even Luke would come back and host an episode.
[4488.94 --> 4489.16]  That would be cool.
[4489.40 --> 4489.82]  I'd like to.
[4490.02 --> 4491.62]  Especially on certain topics.
[4491.78 --> 4492.54]  So yeah.
[4492.54 --> 4497.40]  So I have two things in the chat that I'm going to pull from archival stuff.
[4497.56 --> 4499.86]  One, someone was like, oh my God, Luke is back.
[4500.04 --> 4500.90]  That's confusing.
[4501.96 --> 4503.88]  He's literally on WAN show every week.
[4503.90 --> 4505.46]  I've been here the whole time.
[4506.02 --> 4506.50]  Pretty much.
[4506.84 --> 4509.06]  The other one was, is Riley Luke's replacement?
[4509.48 --> 4510.68]  That's been asked a whole bunch of times.
[4511.34 --> 4518.94]  So right now, in terms of actual hosting on LTT, I am on the fence.
[4518.94 --> 4523.02]  You will see Luke host another LTT before you will see Riley.
[4523.12 --> 4523.84]  In fact, how's that going?
[4524.42 --> 4524.60]  Good.
[4525.40 --> 4526.66]  It keeps changing.
[4527.42 --> 4527.70]  Right.
[4527.86 --> 4529.46]  I can probably just talk about it.
[4529.54 --> 4530.00]  Yeah, sure.
[4530.14 --> 4530.32]  Yeah.
[4530.44 --> 4532.06]  So I'm doing Nintendo Labo.
[4532.90 --> 4536.16]  But I've changed how I wanted to review it a couple times.
[4536.32 --> 4540.72]  I don't think, I haven't seen a single review of it online that I think, this is going to
[4540.72 --> 4543.56]  throw some shade, has done a very good job.
[4543.70 --> 4544.50]  Because I agree.
[4544.50 --> 4549.90]  Um, and because of that, I'm now like, okay, that's a lot of pressure.
[4550.34 --> 4553.38]  Because I'm thinking no one's done a very good job of covering it.
[4553.46 --> 4554.98]  So now I need to not screw up.
[4555.06 --> 4556.42]  You've been in that position before.
[4556.52 --> 4558.38]  And I think, I'm trying to think of an example.
[4558.80 --> 4562.18]  Um, we were really late on, was it the Rift?
[4563.20 --> 4566.88]  We were really late on something that you like cared about a lot.
[4567.36 --> 4568.26]  Might have been Vive.
[4568.36 --> 4569.08]  I think it was one of those.
[4569.12 --> 4570.82]  It was, it was, it was a VR headset, I think.
[4570.82 --> 4571.02]  Yeah.
[4571.38 --> 4573.98]  And basically, I think we talked about it.
[4574.38 --> 4579.22]  And we were like, okay, well then in that case, yeah, I think I, okay, I'm remembering
[4579.22 --> 4580.10]  this even better now.
[4580.40 --> 4581.96]  Uh, I remember talking about it.
[4582.04 --> 4585.12]  And you were like, this is going to take a long time.
[4585.12 --> 4589.48]  And so I took on sort of some more quick, quick videos to fill in the gaps.
[4589.48 --> 4591.66]  Because I think you spent like almost an entire week on it.
[4591.82 --> 4591.98]  Yeah.
[4591.98 --> 4596.54]  So it's been a little bit hard because this week we've been, we've been pushing for V1,
[4596.70 --> 4597.86]  which won't mean anything to you guys.
[4598.30 --> 4599.00]  Also, I'm hiring.
[4599.62 --> 4600.12]  For FlowPlant.
[4600.40 --> 4600.56]  Yeah.
[4600.70 --> 4601.90]  Also, I'm hiring for FlowPlant.
[4602.08 --> 4603.52]  So I've been going through resumes and stuff.
[4603.74 --> 4605.20]  Also, I've been trying to do this Labo thing.
[4605.30 --> 4606.98]  And I was like, I'll be done early in the week.
[4607.14 --> 4609.56]  And then I was like, done most of my notes.
[4609.64 --> 4610.94]  And I was like, it's been out for a while.
[4611.02 --> 4612.40]  Let me watch some reviews and see what's going on.
[4612.42 --> 4615.72]  And I was like, oh, okay.
[4616.74 --> 4617.40]  All right.
[4617.40 --> 4618.80]  But this changes things.
[4618.88 --> 4623.20]  Because when like, when everyone else's stuff is like, again, I'm going to throw some shade.
[4623.52 --> 4628.32]  Really surface level and really missing the point, in my opinion, for most people.
[4631.00 --> 4632.24]  It's, it's, yeah.
[4632.38 --> 4634.00]  I have to take it to the next level, I think.
[4634.40 --> 4634.80]  So, yeah.
[4634.82 --> 4636.08]  I should be ready relatively soon.
[4636.20 --> 4637.58]  I'm expecting next week.
[4637.92 --> 4641.88]  So I'm traveling for like the next two and a half weeks or something like that.
[4642.34 --> 4646.36]  Oh, have we told people that Scrapyard Wars Season 7 is coming?
[4647.40 --> 4648.88]  No, I don't think so.
[4649.00 --> 4649.74]  We are shooting.
[4649.94 --> 4651.18]  We actually have a shoot date.
[4651.56 --> 4651.76]  Yeah.
[4651.88 --> 4653.04]  We have a sponsor locked in.
[4653.12 --> 4654.48]  Finally, we've got a shoot date.
[4655.36 --> 4658.46]  It's going to, should we tell them the challenge?
[4659.44 --> 4662.34]  I mean, I don't know it off the top of my head.
[4662.44 --> 4662.74]  Let's do it.
[4662.74 --> 4664.46]  I've been, I've been emailed it.
[4664.54 --> 4665.08]  I just don't remember.
[4665.14 --> 4665.26]  Sure.
[4665.36 --> 4665.54]  Okay.
[4665.60 --> 4665.76]  Yeah.
[4665.80 --> 4665.98]  Yeah.
[4665.98 --> 4669.90]  So it's going to be a classic head to head me versus Luke.
[4670.30 --> 4675.18]  No teams, no gimmicks, except for one gimmick.
[4675.18 --> 4680.40]  Neither of us gets an internet capable device.
[4680.72 --> 4682.48]  Oh, oh, I remember that.
[4682.70 --> 4683.72]  Oh, I remember that.
[4684.24 --> 4686.46]  Oh, that's so sketch.
[4687.30 --> 4687.74]  Okay.
[4687.90 --> 4688.14]  Okay.
[4688.28 --> 4688.56]  Okay.
[4688.56 --> 4692.98]  Previous seasons, we've been heavily reliant on Craigslist.
[4693.12 --> 4693.48]  Hardcore.
[4693.64 --> 4696.32]  Or like buy and sell trade apps.
[4697.02 --> 4701.00]  Is it still possible to build a decent gaming rig?
[4701.38 --> 4702.68]  What other rules are we including?
[4703.62 --> 4704.30]  I don't know.
[4704.38 --> 4708.02]  We're going to have to kind of, we'll have to hash that out between the two of us a little
[4708.02 --> 4708.40]  bit, I think.
[4708.40 --> 4711.90]  Because I'm assuming like the one, the like ace in the hole is not allowed.
[4712.06 --> 4712.76]  I don't remember the name of it.
[4712.78 --> 4712.88]  Yeah.
[4712.90 --> 4713.66]  You can't go to free geek.
[4713.78 --> 4713.94]  Yeah.
[4714.32 --> 4714.68]  Yeah.
[4714.78 --> 4715.52]  No, no, no.
[4715.60 --> 4719.60]  Or like, and we're also getting rid of free geek similar situations.
[4719.60 --> 4727.44]  Um, I think if you and I both do no research, which is what I've done, um, and we don't
[4727.44 --> 4728.56]  look them up online.
[4728.70 --> 4729.26]  I don't know any.
[4729.46 --> 4730.62]  I don't know any either.
[4730.76 --> 4731.30]  So we'd have to.
[4731.32 --> 4733.02]  I think they're fair game at that point.
[4733.30 --> 4735.96]  So we'd have to like go to the library and get a phone book.
[4736.28 --> 4738.84]  I wouldn't give me any ideas if I were you.
[4739.52 --> 4740.18]  All right.
[4740.34 --> 4745.56]  So we're going to keep to ourselves what our ideas might be for.
[4747.04 --> 4748.62]  That's pretty crazy.
[4748.62 --> 4749.58]  It's going to be really hard.
[4749.58 --> 4749.86]  Okay.
[4750.06 --> 4750.26]  Yeah.
[4750.32 --> 4750.92]  That's going to be interesting.
[4751.18 --> 4754.74]  Luckily, the one thing I was actually really worried about for this coming Scrapyard Wars
[4754.74 --> 4755.74]  was GPU prices.
[4756.56 --> 4757.84]  It looks like that's all resolved.
[4758.14 --> 4758.90]  That's coming back down.
[4759.04 --> 4763.68]  So I think we dodged that bullet because that was like actually going to make it impossible
[4763.68 --> 4764.34]  or stupid.
[4764.34 --> 4767.66]  They were going to be the crappiest Scrapyard Wars PCs yet.
[4767.96 --> 4768.08]  Yeah.
[4768.90 --> 4772.68]  We would have had to do like the like student computer.
[4774.06 --> 4775.22]  CPU benchmarks only.
[4776.34 --> 4777.66]  Neenan262 in the chat.
[4777.66 --> 4779.12]  Sorry.
[4779.26 --> 4782.14]  Just blowing the dust off my local computer store.
[4782.26 --> 4782.98]  Yeah, exactly.
[4784.02 --> 4786.14]  Man, this is going to be pretty dumb.
[4787.94 --> 4788.34]  Yeah.
[4788.76 --> 4789.28]  All right.
[4789.36 --> 4791.54]  Well, I think that's pretty much it for WAN Show.
[4791.78 --> 4793.04]  Thank you guys for tuning in.
[4793.18 --> 4793.90]  See you again next week.
[4794.00 --> 4795.32]  Same bat time, same bat channel.
[4795.48 --> 4795.72]  Bye.
[4795.72 --> 4795.88]  Bye.
[4796.60 --> 4801.44]  Oh, we should let people weigh in on whether they want the WAN Show to stay here with the
[4801.44 --> 4805.30]  white, orange and white, or if we want to move over to the hex wall.
[4805.62 --> 4806.02]  Yeah.
[4806.46 --> 4807.84]  We haven't painted the hex wall yet though.
[4808.06 --> 4810.10]  I think right now there's like a lighting problem or something.
[4810.14 --> 4810.40]  Oh yeah.
[4810.40 --> 4815.92]  It just needs to be, it needs a light on the floor to even it out a little bit.
[4815.92 --> 4817.12]  Like your face.
[4817.22 --> 4819.02]  And we're also going to have some shelves here.
[4819.32 --> 4819.48]  Yeah.
[4819.52 --> 4820.72]  Like there's going to be some stuff there.
[4820.88 --> 4821.80]  Like, yeah.
[4822.20 --> 4823.48]  No, there's some, there's some.
[4823.56 --> 4824.54]  Should we straw for it right now?
[4824.78 --> 4826.96]  Looks like people are sounding hex wall, but they're also getting banned.
[4827.14 --> 4828.54]  People want, oh, um.
[4828.66 --> 4829.04]  No, no.
[4829.08 --> 4830.02]  We can ask them next week.
[4830.22 --> 4830.38]  Okay.
[4830.38 --> 4831.44]  Am I even here next week?
[4831.70 --> 4833.12]  Hex wall will be really dark.
[4833.52 --> 4833.78]  Yeah.
[4833.78 --> 4835.10]  That's something to consider.
[4835.24 --> 4837.34]  Well, we're going to paint it red, white, and blue.
[4837.86 --> 4838.14]  Okay.
[4838.32 --> 4840.28]  Not like America style red, white, and blue.
[4840.40 --> 4842.60]  Like, um, I forget how we're planning to do it.
[4842.66 --> 4845.24]  Like white background and then like red and blue hexes or something.
[4845.36 --> 4845.46]  Okay.
[4845.86 --> 4846.92]  But like bright ones.
[4846.92 --> 4852.68]  I think what we should do is on the WAN Show have a screenshot of here and there.
[4853.40 --> 4854.88]  And put like both of them on screen.
[4854.94 --> 4855.18]  Yeah.
[4855.28 --> 4856.34]  And then be like, pick one.
[4856.48 --> 4857.00]  We could do that.
[4857.92 --> 4858.52]  All right.
[4858.98 --> 4859.50]  See ya.
[4859.64 --> 4859.86]  Okay.
[4859.88 --> 4860.20]  Bye.
[4860.20 --> 4864.12]  I just realized I'm sitting on the wrong side.
[4864.46 --> 4864.74]  Yeah.
