[0.00 → 0.60] Nice.
[2.54 → 3.92] It's the WAN Show!
[5.18 → 5.70] Hooray!
[5.70 → 10.14] Oh man, so everyone who's playing WAN Show Bingo out there, you're welcome.
[10.14 → 10.88] I got that free space.
[11.00 → 11.52] You're welcome.
[12.10 → 13.30] We didn't give it to them last week.
[13.38 → 15.02] Yeah, I know, we were on time last week.
[15.22 → 20.02] I got the least amount of success screenshots sent to my Twitter last week.
[20.28 → 23.28] Of any other week, because I think people are used to getting that free spot.
[23.34 → 24.02] Oh, terrible.
[25.18 → 27.98] So, yeah, we've had a fascinating week.
[27.98 → 30.34] Can we do float plane news?
[31.00 → 33.30] Can we tell people what's going to happen next week?
[33.96 → 35.18] I want it to just happen.
[35.18 → 35.48] Come on.
[35.76 → 37.56] Actually, I forgot to ask you.
[37.68 → 41.92] In our little meeting, I wanted to ask you how we were going to deal with it in terms of communication.
[42.32 → 43.34] So is this how you want it?
[43.46 → 44.76] I want people to know.
[44.84 → 45.64] You want to pre-announce?
[45.66 → 46.82] I want to tell the people.
[47.52 → 48.26] Tell the people.
[48.60 → 49.64] But what if it doesn't work?
[49.88 → 55.50] Then they're going to know that we told them what our plan was and that our plan ultimately fell through,
[55.50 → 59.18] which will be a huge surprise to only a very small percentage of them.
[59.36 → 59.48] Okay.
[59.88 → 60.34] That's fair.
[60.84 → 62.60] Well, we plan on launching the...
[62.60 → 63.92] What is going on here?
[64.26 → 65.02] I don't know.
[65.32 → 66.36] I just don't even...
[66.36 → 69.48] No one's supposed to touch this set between Friday.
[69.54 → 70.10] You did!
[70.54 → 71.42] I didn't move that.
[71.44 → 71.98] You replaced the monitor.
[71.98 → 76.16] I spent a while being like, what is wrong with the saturation?
[76.16 → 77.86] Now, I didn't replace the monitor.
[78.30 → 78.60] Okay.
[78.78 → 80.26] I just took the monitor.
[80.48 → 80.92] Okay.
[80.92 → 83.18] I did not actually put a new one there.
[83.34 → 83.88] Literally not better.
[83.88 → 86.98] So in my defence, what you just said was actually not true.
[87.08 → 87.34] Right.
[87.50 → 89.06] But what you corrected me with was worse.
[89.32 → 93.30] Anyway, next week, sometime on Wednesday.
[93.52 → 95.92] Let's say definitely by Thursday.
[96.26 → 98.36] Although time zones, so who knows.
[98.56 → 100.26] But sometime on Wednesday for sure.
[100.26 → 104.06] So if you check too early, it might not be there.
[104.22 → 104.62] But whatever.
[104.78 → 105.42] Sometime on Wednesday.
[105.42 → 105.76] Can't do it!
[106.58 → 108.32] I just liked watching you freak out.
[108.76 → 111.24] We're launching the alpha of the float plane website.
[111.36 → 114.22] Meaning you'll be able to sign up for an account directly through that website.
[114.56 → 116.86] You'll be able to pay for it with credit card.
[117.32 → 118.06] That's new.
[118.54 → 121.36] You won't be able to pay for it with PayPal, which is hilarious.
[121.70 → 124.76] If you want to use PayPal, you have to go back to the forum.
[124.78 → 125.60] We're going to fix that.
[125.72 → 126.48] That will be fixed.
[126.90 → 128.58] Braintree's being...
[128.58 → 130.54] Perfect people.
[130.64 → 133.54] In case anyone from Braintree is watching, we need to stay on their good side.
[135.02 → 135.42] Yeah.
[137.56 → 139.94] So right now, just credit card.
[141.10 → 142.90] And you'll be able to watch videos there.
[142.98 → 143.70] You'll be able to comment.
[143.84 → 144.84] Won't be able to reply to people.
[144.92 → 145.70] LOL, get wrecked.
[146.24 → 146.90] That'll come.
[147.24 → 151.44] But yeah, this will be the first time that you'll be able to do everything on the new website.
[151.44 → 153.62] You won't need forum integration.
[154.66 → 159.56] You can just go there, pay for a subscription, watch there, all that kind of stuff.
[159.56 → 169.50] So to everyone out there who said that Float plane was never going to launch because Luke's an idea man.
[169.86 → 171.30] And also it's a bad idea.
[171.48 → 173.92] So that, you know, compounded the issue in their minds.
[174.30 → 177.34] And also that the way that we recruited developers was really dumb.
[177.48 → 180.68] Making a video and then publishing it on a tech channel.
[181.00 → 181.48] Super dumb.
[181.62 → 182.40] That was dumb, by the way.
[182.40 → 189.02] So in response to everyone who ever said anything about that, I got this for you.
[189.24 → 189.54] Right there.
[190.46 → 191.72] And demonetized.
[191.76 → 192.52] It's gone.
[193.18 → 194.50] This is why we're on Float plane.
[194.60 → 194.98] That's right.
[195.06 → 196.64] This is why we need Float plane.
[196.82 → 197.04] Yeah.
[197.70 → 199.22] Oh, let's roll the intro.
[199.68 → 199.90] Yeah.
[206.80 → 210.38] We should replace my part instead of like clenching in the thing.
[210.38 → 211.66] I should be like flying.
[212.40 → 213.92] And then like something goes wrong.
[214.04 → 215.44] And then I'm able to land on the water.
[215.64 → 216.28] Because it's a little place.
[216.80 → 217.30] Oh, yeah.
[217.62 → 218.36] Um, no.
[219.20 → 220.82] You know, good thought.
[221.02 → 221.76] But no.
[221.98 → 223.08] I'll stick to the tech channel.
[227.04 → 230.12] Yeah, let's leave the design to the designers.
[230.52 → 231.00] You know?
[233.22 → 234.14] Yeah, Float plane.
[234.26 → 236.74] The site where middle fingers are totally allowed.
[236.82 → 237.52] Yeah, it's completely okay.
[237.52 → 239.20] Because they're totally okay there.
[239.20 → 240.72] Yeah, nobody's going to mind.
[240.72 → 242.20] Um, all right.
[242.20 → 242.40] That's fine.
[242.50 → 244.30] So, what do we get?
[244.40 → 245.06] What do we get?
[245.12 → 245.36] What do we get?
[245.36 → 246.40] We got topics, technically.
[246.56 → 247.68] Yeah, technically we got topics.
[247.84 → 249.66] Oh, oh, oh, okay.
[249.96 → 251.14] So, this is interesting.
[251.42 → 254.30] Do we want to jump right into the Intel discrete GPU prototype?
[254.30 → 254.66] We can.
[255.04 → 258.14] Or, considering we're talking about Float plane right now, we can just talk about what's on
[258.14 → 258.82] Float plane right now.
[259.04 → 259.70] It's up to you.
[259.96 → 260.16] Okay.
[260.16 → 260.84] Or we can do that later.
[260.84 → 262.34] Up to you.
[264.66 → 266.08] Uh, uh, uh, uh, sorry.
[266.12 → 268.00] I wasn't listening because I was checking my notes.
[268.10 → 275.66] I have some notes from Dr. Curtis, my favourite writer over at Anand Tech, about this topic.
[275.82 → 276.98] So, I'm just going to jump into it.
[277.14 → 278.80] I didn't hear what you said, and I'm sorry.
[278.94 → 279.40] It's cool.
[279.46 → 279.68] Go for it.
[279.68 → 282.98] This was posted by NumLock21 on the phone.
[285.64 → 286.34] Thanks, Unlock.
[286.38 → 287.08] What are you going to do, quit?
[289.04 → 290.86] Um, so the original...
[290.86 → 291.10] Done.
[292.18 → 294.78] The original article here is from Tech Power Up.
[295.42 → 300.38] Intel unveils discrete GPU prototype development.
[300.72 → 300.98] Yeah.
[300.98 → 307.76] So, it wasn't that long ago that AMD made a high profile hire.
[307.76 → 311.82] Uh, Raja Kauri, AMD's former head of Radeon Technologies Group.
[312.50 → 314.76] Um, but clearly...
[314.76 → 317.12] So, there's a bunch of stuff here.
[317.20 → 318.76] So, there's like this.
[319.84 → 322.64] There's got like a block diagram, which is fascinating.
[323.64 → 328.30] There's what looks like sort of mock-up of what a die shot might look like.
[328.34 → 332.70] Like, there's a bunch of what looks like very internal information.
[332.70 → 342.14] Um, and a lot of people are extrapolating a bunch of information about this supposed 14 nanometre dedicated GPU.
[342.14 → 347.14] And, um, so Dr. Kurtis actually proactively because...
[348.70 → 363.30] Ian, do you really not, you know, believe in our fact-checking to the point where we would, you know, dig through all these diagrams and figure out the misinterpretation that other sites, you know, might have accidentally made here?
[363.42 → 365.56] Do you really not believe that we're capable of that?
[365.74 → 366.40] I appreciate it.
[366.40 → 370.94] Because, you know, thank you for covering our butts because we were not capable of that.
[371.08 → 372.00] Thank you, Dr. Kurtis.
[372.24 → 372.32] Yeah.
[372.68 → 377.36] So, he proactively reached out because he was sure that we were going to talk about this.
[377.82 → 378.76] And I'm just going to read it.
[378.78 → 380.80] I'm just going to read it because he put it better than I could have.
[381.64 → 383.68] It's almost like he's a professional writer or something.
[384.20 → 384.72] I don't know.
[384.86 → 385.20] Maybe.
[385.68 → 385.82] Weird.
[385.82 → 385.86] Weird.
[386.32 → 392.94] Just wanted to poke about the Intel discrete GPU hullabaloo that's been going around this week that might end up in WAN show.
[392.94 → 399.84] So, everywhere is quoting it as a discrete GPU prototype, but that is because of a slight misreading of the Japanese article source.
[400.00 → 400.32] Okay.
[400.50 → 405.38] Leave it to Dr. Kurtis to pick out the slight misreading of the Japanese article.
[406.76 → 416.28] While it uses Intel graphics, the chip is actually a test design for a better dynamic voltage frequency system implementation applicable to a wide range of chips.
[416.58 → 416.74] Oh.
[416.74 → 418.30] GPU, GPU, and FPGA.
[418.76 → 423.36] It was done on a GPU core because it was an easy design on 14 nanometers to start with.
[423.76 → 431.60] The Japanese article from which the translation comes, when auto-translated, does state that it's a discrete GPU prototype.
[431.60 → 440.66] But the author, who is very well-respected and knowledgeable, Goth-san, clarifies this point in the second paragraph by stating it was only a vehicle for it was actually being announced and tested.
[441.04 → 443.58] And the fact that it was built on a GPU was inconsequential.
[444.12 → 444.28] Okay.
[444.28 → 450.08] So, basically, no, in the I don't know, has it been two months since Raja got hired at Intel?
[450.40 → 456.30] No, in the last however many weeks it's been, he has not built a GPU, necessarily.
[456.56 → 456.66] Yeah.
[457.52 → 458.36] He might have.
[458.38 → 458.66] I don't know.
[458.68 → 459.32] He's kind of amazing.
[459.58 → 460.78] But he has not.
[461.88 → 470.58] And this is like some power and clock management stuff that might end up in that GPU, but might not.
[471.32 → 471.98] But probably would.
[472.20 → 472.78] But might not.
[472.78 → 475.98] It sounds like Raja and whatever team he has is probably just playing.
[476.96 → 478.24] So, yeah, there you go.
[478.40 → 479.86] This is, yeah.
[480.62 → 483.08] Like it says, test vehicle, not a future product.
[483.20 → 484.46] It sounds like they're just playing around.
[484.68 → 486.06] So, let's go through our notes.
[486.12 → 491.86] With all of that in mind, let's go through the notes that we had based on other tech press' reporting.
[491.86 → 497.48] The first 14 nanometers dedicated GPU prototype is a two-chip solution.
[497.48 → 500.44] The first contains the GPU itself and the system agent.
[500.60 → 503.20] The second is an FPGA that interfaces with the system bus.
[503.54 → 505.54] It's 1.5 billion transistors.
[505.54 → 511.04] So, NVIDIA's GP102 is built on 60 nanometers and has 12 billion.
[511.04 → 514.34] But keep in mind, none of this really matters.
[514.44 → 514.66] Yes.
[515.00 → 516.56] Because that's not what it is at all.
[516.66 → 516.92] Yeah.
[516.92 → 525.48] And following media speculation about the slides, Intel has stated that they presented a research paper exploring new circuit techniques optimized for power management.
[525.98 → 527.72] And actually, you know what?
[528.12 → 529.06] Kudos to James.
[529.52 → 530.46] He had it right.
[530.74 → 532.44] He had all the clarifications in here.
[532.68 → 534.92] It is a test vehicle only, not a future product.
[534.92 → 535.26] It does.
[535.26 → 536.32] Much ado about nothing.
[536.68 → 537.10] In bold.
[537.30 → 537.42] Here.
[537.58 → 538.74] You guys can see James' notes.
[539.02 → 539.70] Credit to James.
[540.02 → 540.64] Good job, James.
[541.26 → 542.00] Good job, James.
[542.22 → 542.80] Good job, James.
[542.92 → 547.12] You'll, you'll, you know, whether you like it or not, you'll have to work here another day.
[548.34 → 549.48] Because you're not allowed to leave.
[550.30 → 550.88] Actually, wait.
[550.98 → 551.18] No.
[551.36 → 551.54] No.
[551.66 → 551.94] James.
[552.06 → 554.20] I have not added James to my soul collection yet.
[554.62 → 556.10] That's my internal joke.
[556.48 → 561.08] As soon as people buy a house and get a mortgage, then I kind of cackle.
[561.08 → 565.24] And I go like, now I own you.
[566.12 → 567.02] See, see, Brandon.
[567.34 → 568.10] Brandon's listening.
[568.44 → 569.38] Yeah, that's right, Brandon.
[569.50 → 570.34] You know what's up.
[570.98 → 572.16] You guys know what I don't own yet?
[574.48 → 575.82] There are many reasons why, but.
[576.32 → 576.96] But, um.
[577.08 → 578.44] I would like to, to be clear.
[578.80 → 578.98] Yeah.
[579.18 → 579.34] Yeah.
[579.48 → 579.64] Yeah.
[579.80 → 580.54] So, ha.
[581.00 → 581.94] Ha ha, Brandon.
[583.24 → 583.90] I hate you.
[584.50 → 585.72] He says he hates me.
[586.04 → 589.52] I'm just, in case the microphone didn't pick it up, we're just getting that out there.
[589.52 → 591.38] I'd give you my soul if I wasn't an American.
[591.52 → 592.70] Have you been to Brandon's place yet?
[592.96 → 593.18] Yes.
[593.48 → 594.08] Super nice.
[594.10 → 594.98] It is actually really nice.
[594.98 → 595.38] Yeah.
[595.44 → 599.56] Did you notice the amount of, like, random little storage cubby things?
[600.08 → 603.20] I think it's probably less than it feels like.
[603.24 → 605.98] It probably feels like a lot to you, because I know your place has, like.
[606.06 → 606.30] None?
[606.44 → 606.92] A closet.
[607.22 → 607.38] Yeah.
[607.78 → 609.16] Don't give me that none.
[609.22 → 609.94] It has a closet.
[610.28 → 611.00] It has a closet.
[611.06 → 614.82] It has a closet that also has the central VAC and the boiler.
[615.20 → 615.44] Oh, no.
[615.58 → 616.14] That doesn't count.
[616.18 → 617.20] You can't put anything in there.
[617.38 → 618.72] I'm talking about under the stairs.
[619.14 → 620.24] Yeah, I'm talking about under the stairs.
[620.24 → 621.42] Isn't that where the central VAC is?
[621.66 → 622.32] Oh, yeah.
[622.44 → 622.64] Yeah.
[622.64 → 623.28] That doesn't really take a lot of storage.
[623.28 → 623.42] Oh, no.
[623.50 → 623.92] That other one.
[623.98 → 624.62] That's not a closet.
[624.62 → 624.86] Yeah.
[625.20 → 626.10] That's not fair.
[626.36 → 626.76] No, no, no.
[626.94 → 628.00] There's technically closet doors.
[628.30 → 628.48] Yeah.
[628.48 → 628.60] Yeah.
[628.60 → 629.40] So, yeah.
[629.52 → 630.82] So, compared to Luke's place, yeah.
[630.88 → 632.52] But I think Brandon's going to run out of storage.
[633.04 → 635.44] But what I like about it is that.
[636.02 → 638.12] Brandon, how much can I talk about your place?
[638.66 → 639.46] I don't care.
[639.58 → 640.08] Okay, cool.
[640.80 → 646.28] So, unlike other town houses, what's really cool about it is it's a little bit wider.
[646.74 → 649.50] So, it doesn't feel quite as much as living on a ship.
[649.82 → 650.66] Or, like, yeah.
[650.88 → 651.74] Like in a sliver.
[651.90 → 652.22] Yeah, yeah.
[652.22 → 652.46] Yeah.
[652.96 → 659.48] Like, it feels more like the rooms feel more square instead of, like, every room had to
[659.48 → 665.08] be kind of, like, put in front of the other room and, like, kind of made a row of them.
[666.14 → 669.52] And it even has side-by-side parking.
[670.08 → 670.26] Yeah.
[670.36 → 672.86] Which is sick for a town house.
[672.90 → 678.66] It was weird when I went to go park there that if you want to park in the driveway, you
[678.66 → 679.18] don't fit.
[680.20 → 680.60] Yeah.
[680.60 → 685.34] But then there is also side-by-side parking and, like, a really nice garage and stuff.
[685.34 → 687.84] And he's right next to the visitor parking, which is super cool.
[687.98 → 689.18] It's literally right there.
[689.20 → 689.52] Oh, that makes sense.
[689.72 → 691.04] And there's more coming in.
[691.26 → 693.80] Apparently, there's, like, six more visitor spots coming in soon.
[693.92 → 694.02] That's good.
[694.34 → 694.90] So, yeah.
[695.24 → 696.46] It's pretty nice.
[696.66 → 697.62] It's pretty dope.
[698.00 → 698.96] There's a...
[698.96 → 699.76] I like it a lot.
[699.78 → 703.54] There's at least three different places that you could put a barbecue, and you'd be out
[703.54 → 705.50] there barbecuing, and you'd feel pretty good about it.
[705.94 → 707.22] So, you know.
[707.24 → 708.18] That's an important thing.
[708.18 → 710.44] That is an important metric.
[710.60 → 711.44] Is it not?
[713.18 → 716.64] Someone randomly posted in here, Linus fact of the day.
[716.76 → 721.18] Linus was born in western Pennsylvania before moving to Canada at the age of five.
[721.72 → 722.06] Sure.
[722.14 → 722.84] Let's go with that.
[723.00 → 723.14] Yeah.
[723.44 → 723.82] Nice.
[723.82 → 728.60] So, I don't remember where I was going with this, but Brandon's house is sweet, and I got
[728.60 → 728.96] to see it.
[729.06 → 729.16] Yeah.
[729.16 → 730.06] How did we get there?
[730.06 → 731.40] I don't know.
[731.40 → 734.94] I mean, that's the beauty of this show slash the bane of this show.
[736.64 → 738.28] What are we talking about?
[738.50 → 738.82] Oh!
[739.40 → 742.66] No, you were talking about James and capturing his soul.
[743.06 → 743.36] Oh, yeah.
[743.38 → 744.44] I haven't captured his soul yet.
[744.60 → 744.78] Yeah.
[744.78 → 747.08] But I have captured quite a few souls now.
[747.14 → 748.20] I'm feeling pretty good about it.
[748.74 → 750.94] It's like, you guys can't leave me.
[750.94 → 757.08] Because if you think about it, like, a mortgage is, it's like, it's like basically getting
[757.08 → 757.54] married.
[757.98 → 758.46] It's like.
[758.52 → 760.44] I think it's like potentially harder.
[760.52 → 760.64] Yeah.
[760.72 → 763.08] I think it's actually more difficult to get out of than a marriage.
[763.20 → 763.28] If you.
[763.98 → 765.04] Isn't that crazy?
[765.70 → 769.90] Now, if we think about sort of the traditional values of marriage.
[770.90 → 772.50] Which aren't even that applicable anymore.
[772.80 → 773.08] Which.
[773.30 → 774.08] Well, no, no.
[774.12 → 774.50] I just mean.
[774.68 → 774.98] No.
[775.08 → 778.18] Like, if we go back to the whole till death do us part.
[778.46 → 779.84] Like, let's focus on that part.
[780.22 → 785.18] Like, if we call that sort of the tradition of marriage.
[787.92 → 788.32] Wow.
[788.42 → 790.24] It's really eroded a lot.
[790.38 → 790.52] Oh, yeah.
[790.52 → 791.42] To the point where like.
[791.44 → 792.90] Isn't it like 50% fail or something?
[792.90 → 794.50] I don't, I don't know what it is.
[794.56 → 795.04] But like.
[796.42 → 798.28] We take a mortgage.
[799.04 → 800.28] A car lease.
[800.36 → 802.44] Like, I think it's, it's pretty hard to break a car lease.
[802.44 → 802.82] Isn't it?
[803.32 → 805.28] Like, you can't just be like, yeah, you know.
[806.56 → 810.22] North Shore Auto Group and I have irreconcilable differences.
[810.80 → 814.36] About 40 to 50% of married couples in the United States divorce.
[815.42 → 815.86] Wow.
[815.98 → 816.66] To be fair.
[817.24 → 821.14] What is also in that percentage is people that have been divorced more than once.
[821.42 → 821.72] Right.
[821.72 → 822.50] So it's not like.
[823.70 → 824.06] Yeah.
[824.14 → 824.64] It's not like.
[824.64 → 826.90] So it could be one person who's done it four times.
[827.02 → 827.20] Right.
[827.28 → 827.38] Right.
[827.38 → 828.94] All four of those goes in.
[829.10 → 830.48] But it is technically four different relationships.
[830.48 → 831.14] Well, like, isn't that.
[831.34 → 834.44] So, like, I was looking at some gun ownership statistics in the United States.
[834.44 → 836.52] I think they have more than one gun per person.
[836.70 → 838.58] But I forget what they call the mega owners.
[838.72 → 838.94] Yeah.
[839.10 → 839.82] Super owners.
[839.98 → 840.12] Yeah.
[840.12 → 842.72] Where they have, like, more than 100 each.
[842.90 → 842.96] Yeah.
[842.96 → 845.86] And it's, like, some very small percentage or something like that.
[845.86 → 846.40] It may count for.
[846.42 → 847.76] So, like, mega divorces.
[848.18 → 848.42] Yeah.
[849.18 → 849.50] Might make up.
[849.50 → 851.48] I don't think they're going to have more than 100, but, like.
[851.70 → 851.90] Yeah.
[851.90 → 853.04] More than 100 divorces would.
[853.14 → 853.82] That would be in a.
[853.82 → 857.08] That would legitimately be difficult to pull off.
[857.78 → 858.76] Could you do it?
[859.94 → 862.54] Could you do it with unwitting women?
[863.28 → 864.16] Without them knowing.
[864.54 → 865.38] Oh, my God.
[865.38 → 866.44] Could you convince.
[866.56 → 868.24] The worst reality TV show.
[868.98 → 871.44] Like, actually the worst one.
[872.12 → 873.68] Such a plague on society.
[876.24 → 877.64] That would be really difficult.
[878.00 → 878.90] To be able to pull off.
[879.66 → 880.54] So, if you and I went.
[880.70 → 880.92] Okay.
[882.12 → 882.62] We go.
[882.70 → 883.14] We go into.
[883.14 → 884.54] That's going to be near to 200.
[884.86 → 886.70] We go to a new city every year.
[886.98 → 887.26] Okay.
[887.36 → 893.34] And the idea is to get married and divorced as many times as possible in that year.
[893.58 → 893.60] And.
[893.68 → 894.54] You're going to have to pull.
[894.78 → 895.34] But remember.
[895.88 → 895.96] You.
[896.36 → 897.94] So, there's nothing would prevent you.
[898.00 → 899.68] If you're a devious enough bastard.
[900.18 → 902.38] Nothing would prevent you from rolling multiple.
[902.82 → 904.36] Multiple marriages at once.
[904.54 → 904.66] Yeah.
[905.00 → 908.44] Well, I don't think you can legally be married to two people at the same time.
[908.52 → 908.80] No.
[909.06 → 910.00] So, you would have to.
[910.00 → 911.22] But you'd have to, like, time gate them really well.
[911.22 → 913.12] You would have to manage it really carefully.
[913.12 → 917.42] Well, because you'd, at a minimum, have to do two a year.
[918.34 → 918.80] Oh, yeah.
[919.00 → 919.30] Oh, yeah.
[919.42 → 922.34] Because the time span that you'd actually be effectively able to do this.
[922.40 → 922.60] Yeah.
[923.28 → 923.50] Yeah.
[923.66 → 924.28] At minimum.
[924.44 → 924.80] At minimum.
[924.92 → 927.02] And, like, theoretically, you're going to have to pull more than that.
[927.18 → 927.42] Yeah.
[928.24 → 929.32] I'd watch this show.
[929.94 → 930.58] I would.
[930.66 → 931.88] I'd feel like a terrible person.
[931.88 → 932.92] I wouldn't tell anybody I watched this show.
[932.92 → 933.14] No.
[933.22 → 933.62] Exactly.
[933.80 → 934.02] Yeah.
[934.64 → 936.52] See, I'm saying it now because it doesn't exist.
[936.84 → 937.22] But, like.
[937.52 → 938.64] Playboy Wars.
[939.42 → 941.78] That's a suggestion from AV guy.
[942.72 → 943.60] Oh, man.
[943.60 → 944.60] Wow.
[944.60 → 944.92] Yeah.
[947.52 → 947.84] Wow.
[947.98 → 948.56] And you should have.
[948.64 → 948.78] Okay.
[948.82 → 950.68] You can have two different shows going on at the same time.
[950.88 → 952.14] Because you should have the guys.
[952.14 → 952.78] Marriage Wars.
[952.78 → 954.22] You should have the guys trying to do it.
[954.56 → 956.08] And you should have the girls trying to do it.
[956.34 → 956.58] Yeah.
[957.44 → 958.92] Like, guys versus girls.
[959.36 → 959.82] You know what?
[959.86 → 961.08] We'd be at such a disadvantage.
[961.28 → 961.72] I think so.
[961.82 → 963.16] I have to.
[963.16 → 964.00] But who knows?
[965.06 → 966.04] Like, maybe not.
[966.12 → 969.70] Because it might be harder to convince a guy to marry you.
[969.70 → 970.22] Oh.
[971.04 → 971.34] Oh.
[971.90 → 974.52] And then there's, like, the bisexual and gay aspect.
[974.70 → 975.12] Right.
[975.36 → 975.80] Right.
[976.86 → 977.60] Oh, man.
[977.68 → 981.16] Where, like, you might be able to spin more because of how that community works.
[981.16 → 981.26] Okay.
[981.26 → 982.30] And, like, whatever else.
[982.48 → 982.76] Okay.
[982.76 → 988.80] So, just to, like, not that it matters, but both Luke and I are straight.
[989.30 → 989.54] Yeah.
[990.92 → 992.04] Answer me this.
[992.04 → 994.72] If it meant the difference between winning.
[995.58 → 996.20] You know?
[996.44 → 996.84] Maybe.
[997.80 → 999.06] How far would you go?
[999.76 → 1001.06] It depends on.
[1001.28 → 1002.02] See, if we could.
[1002.32 → 1004.28] I know you'd do almost anything to win.
[1004.30 → 1004.68] Yeah.
[1004.98 → 1006.00] At almost anything.
[1006.24 → 1006.46] Yeah.
[1008.16 → 1009.60] Especially if it's against you.
[1011.72 → 1014.38] If it's against almost, like, anyone else.
[1014.80 → 1014.96] No.
[1016.56 → 1018.52] But if you knew that I was tied.
[1018.52 → 1019.22] That I was tied.
[1019.22 → 1022.10] If I could see your numbers, and you were, like, right beside me.
[1022.20 → 1024.78] If we're at, like, 90, and we're both at, like, 90.
[1026.00 → 1029.58] If I've gone this whole competition, and it just needs that much more to win.
[1030.00 → 1031.28] Like, I'd consider it.
[1031.38 → 1032.12] Oh, man.
[1032.44 → 1032.86] All right.
[1032.96 → 1033.30] So, anyway.
[1033.30 → 1035.98] I'm already that much of a giant jerk.
[1036.16 → 1037.30] I'm trying to not swear.
[1037.54 → 1037.70] So, the.
[1037.86 → 1038.12] Yeah.
[1038.28 → 1038.56] Oh, yeah.
[1038.56 → 1040.62] Like, you're a terrible person at that point.
[1040.62 → 1041.64] Yeah, you're a terrible person already.
[1041.92 → 1042.06] Yeah.
[1043.96 → 1048.40] What's one more deed that is against your thing?
[1048.74 → 1049.12] Yeah.
[1049.18 → 1049.64] I don't know.
[1049.72 → 1049.84] Yeah.
[1049.84 → 1051.18] You're already horrible.
[1051.56 → 1051.76] Yeah.
[1051.86 → 1055.92] So, like, does it matter if you're destroying women or men at that point?
[1056.26 → 1056.96] That's what I mean.
[1057.04 → 1057.36] Yeah.
[1057.62 → 1058.88] And, like, it's another lie.
[1059.02 → 1060.36] So, this is not a good show.
[1060.56 → 1060.78] No.
[1060.86 → 1061.22] You know?
[1061.40 → 1064.40] I don't know what the network is that does all the reality shows.
[1064.40 → 1066.40] But if there are any execs watching, please.
[1066.40 → 1066.78] Don't do it.
[1067.00 → 1068.04] Please don't do this.
[1068.10 → 1073.62] You know, the crazy thing about it, though, is it really any worse than something like
[1073.62 → 1074.60] The Bachelor or The Bachelorette?
[1074.60 → 1075.58] Having actors on it.
[1075.82 → 1076.02] Yeah.
[1076.68 → 1077.46] Well, because.
[1078.40 → 1078.92] Okay.
[1079.34 → 1085.66] If there has ever at any point been anyone who participated in that show that wasn't
[1085.66 → 1089.04] purely an actor who actually, like, believed in it.
[1089.18 → 1091.58] Because you know when they're going to do the recruiting for this stuff.
[1091.58 → 1096.28] Okay, so there was the one TV show in, I believe it was the UK, someone could correct me on
[1096.28 → 1098.96] this, where they had a talent search show that was fake.
[1099.16 → 1099.86] Have you heard about that?
[1099.92 → 1100.24] No.
[1100.62 → 1104.66] And they particularly picked people that were terrible and kept pushing them through.
[1105.24 → 1107.46] And then I don't think they televised any of it or something.
[1107.58 → 1111.10] And then the very last episode they televised and had a live studio audience.
[1111.34 → 1113.88] And they basically told them on stage, like, you're horrible.
[1114.52 → 1115.90] And it was super awkward.
[1116.72 → 1119.00] It was, it was, I don't remember the name of the show.
[1119.00 → 1121.68] But you can watch the last episode on YouTube.
[1121.98 → 1123.62] And it has a giant dislike bar.
[1123.70 → 1125.74] Because everyone's like, wow, this is rough.
[1126.14 → 1131.84] But, like, on stage in front of an entire, yeah, that was called American, American Superstar.
[1131.90 → 1133.06] Oh, okay, so it was an American show.
[1133.70 → 1134.76] Oh, wow.
[1136.92 → 1137.32] That's awful.
[1137.32 → 1139.92] Yeah, it was, it was rough in front of a whole audience.
[1140.30 → 1141.90] And they play, like, her singing.
[1142.46 → 1145.66] Like, it comes down to between a guy and a girl and the girl wins.
[1145.90 → 1148.00] And they play, like, a whole montage of her singing.
[1148.14 → 1151.70] And it's, oh, it's not good.
[1151.80 → 1156.62] And then they're like, yeah, so we picked you because you are the worst person in this category.
[1156.86 → 1159.10] And they're like, yeah, we're still going to give you the studio deal.
[1159.14 → 1160.02] But, like, come on.
[1160.02 → 1162.76] Also, we're going to give you a bunch of money.
[1163.84 → 1165.14] It's really rough.
[1166.18 → 1170.60] And, like, even watching that was, like, kind of soul-destroying.
[1170.82 → 1172.56] It's really, it's really rough.
[1173.14 → 1174.20] Wow, okay.
[1176.14 → 1176.46] Yeah.
[1177.40 → 1177.84] Wow.
[1178.62 → 1179.02] Okay.
[1180.02 → 1182.62] Let's go ahead and maybe do some tech news.
[1182.78 → 1185.14] Because, like, I'm just feeling kind of dirty right now.
[1185.14 → 1189.00] WB Superstar.
[1189.14 → 1189.94] Yeah, I think that's it.
[1190.26 → 1190.74] What is it?
[1191.56 → 1192.56] WB Superstar.
[1193.76 → 1194.80] Yes, this is it.
[1195.14 → 1197.24] The WB's Superstar USA.
[1197.86 → 1198.08] Yeah.
[1198.48 → 1199.30] Oh, man.
[1199.44 → 1199.68] Okay.
[1199.82 → 1200.80] No, I don't want to look at that.
[1200.80 → 1202.78] 40% of users liked this show.
[1203.20 → 1204.04] Like, it's not.
[1205.50 → 1205.90] Oof.
[1206.54 → 1207.06] All right.
[1207.36 → 1208.18] The winner revealed.
[1208.30 → 1208.72] Here we go.
[1208.80 → 1209.18] Let's see.
[1210.72 → 1213.02] Oh, the like-dislike is not as bad as I thought.
[1213.16 → 1214.06] Oh, that's a shame.
[1214.06 → 1214.38] Yeah.
[1214.38 → 1215.68] Okay, so here we go.
[1215.76 → 1219.04] For some reason, I can't find which retailer it's listed on.
[1219.12 → 1220.68] The Tom's Hardware article doesn't say.
[1221.28 → 1226.56] But this was originally posted by TX underscore two underscore steps on the forum Texas Two Step.
[1226.86 → 1227.30] Ah.
[1228.08 → 1229.36] Or Transmitter Two Step.
[1230.00 → 1230.36] Oh.
[1230.48 → 1231.02] Could be that, too.
[1231.02 → 1231.26] All right.
[1231.40 → 1235.42] The Coffee Lake platform is finally being expanded.
[1235.42 → 1238.40] Up until now, you've been limited to, what?
[1238.40 → 1242.34] The 8700K, the 8600K, and the 8400.
[1242.58 → 1244.42] All high-performance six-core parts.
[1245.28 → 1245.68] Wait.
[1247.54 → 1248.82] I5 8600K?
[1248.94 → 1249.46] Oh, here we go.
[1249.66 → 1251.78] So there are three new parts that are coming.
[1251.92 → 1254.46] An I5 8600, like a non-K.
[1255.02 → 1256.60] And, oh, is there an 8700 already?
[1256.68 → 1257.08] There might be.
[1257.70 → 1261.20] There's an I5 8500, so an even lower end.
[1261.24 → 1262.34] Is this going to be a six-core part?
[1262.76 → 1265.14] And then an I3 8300.
[1265.42 → 1267.30] Apparently, there's already an I3 8350K.
[1267.38 → 1267.64] You know what?
[1267.64 → 1269.40] I haven't actually paid that close attention to it.
[1270.12 → 1281.50] I haven't been able to think of a very compelling reason to buy Coffee Lake if you aren't going for an 8600K, or at least an 8400K or up.
[1281.98 → 1286.48] Because, like, I don't know if the 8350K already existed.
[1286.48 → 1294.30] Because unless you were getting six cores on the mainstream platform, you might as well just go for Kaby Lake.
[1294.78 → 1296.00] Because the boards are cheaper.
[1296.00 → 1300.16] If you're not getting an unlocked chip, you do not need to get a Z370 board.
[1300.72 → 1301.54] What can I do for you?
[1302.16 → 1307.58] I just, AJ just posted in the float plane work chat saying, that's why I don't move.
[1307.72 → 1308.62] You won't get my soul.
[1308.94 → 1313.22] If you buy a house in Quebec, one, I hate you a little bit.
[1313.34 → 1315.20] Two, that still means I own your soul.
[1317.90 → 1318.90] Oh, Lord.
[1319.08 → 1319.58] So get out.
[1320.20 → 1325.90] Okay, so these are meant to be paired with the upcoming budget-oriented H370 and B360.
[1326.00 → 1333.12] ProVantage, as apparently the retailer, also lists down-clocked T versions of all of these processors for bulk purchase.
[1333.92 → 1334.92] So neat.
[1335.28 → 1338.14] In other news, this was originally posted over on Digitizes.
[1338.14 → 1347.12] AUO to begin shipping 8K TV panels in the first half of this year.
[1347.18 → 1347.58] Do you care?
[1348.30 → 1348.60] No.
[1348.72 → 1349.12] I thought you don't.
[1349.20 → 1349.38] Yeah.
[1349.38 → 1353.80] You said it in such an excited, like, 8K TV panel.
[1354.02 → 1354.88] Then I was like, I don't think he cares.
[1354.88 → 1356.34] Well, I know, but it's like, 8K!
[1357.10 → 1357.30] Yeah.
[1358.04 → 1358.50] You know?
[1359.30 → 1359.78] Bitcoin!
[1359.78 → 1359.86] Bitcoin!
[1362.66 → 1366.84] So here's why you might care about an 8K panel.
[1367.68 → 1368.08] And...
[1368.08 → 1369.40] Okay.
[1370.00 → 1370.84] You sit here.
[1370.84 → 1374.44] Reason number one.
[1375.28 → 1375.98] You sit very close.
[1377.52 → 1378.70] Reason number two.
[1379.36 → 1381.84] You really like stereoscopic 3D.
[1382.82 → 1383.18] Shut up.
[1383.56 → 1387.08] And you want your stereoscopic 3D to be at 4K.
[1387.08 → 1391.08] Because every other line would be effectively...
[1391.08 → 1391.38] Yeah, yeah.
[1391.38 → 1393.18] Actually, it would be a little more.
[1393.38 → 1396.52] Because it would be double the resolution of 4K.
[1397.22 → 1398.68] No, half the resolution of...
[1398.68 → 1399.62] Of 8.
[1399.62 → 1399.92] Blah, blah, blah.
[1400.26 → 1403.04] It would be double the pixel count, half the resolution.
[1403.18 → 1403.30] Sorry.
[1403.78 → 1403.98] Okay.
[1405.00 → 1405.98] Reason number the third.
[1408.46 → 1409.84] That was a pretty creative number two.
[1410.00 → 1410.32] I'm interested.
[1410.38 → 1415.40] You really like high-performance display scaler technology.
[1415.40 → 1417.28] And you want high...
[1417.28 → 1417.62] Shut up.
[1417.82 → 1419.90] High refresh rate 4K displays.
[1420.78 → 1421.16] Okay.
[1421.68 → 1425.16] So those scalers will have to be developed and built for these 8K TVs.
[1425.44 → 1426.66] And eventually they will trickle down.
[1428.06 → 1429.16] Reason number the fourth.
[1429.54 → 1430.68] I'm trying really hard here.
[1432.38 → 1433.52] That was pretty right.
[1433.68 → 1440.70] You want pixel densities to keep climbing for mobile displays.
[1440.92 → 1442.46] Actually, it's pretty different technology for games.
[1442.72 → 1443.76] So that was all I had.
[1443.76 → 1446.80] One thing I want to complain about while I have a moment here.
[1446.94 → 1448.02] And we're talking about panels.
[1448.32 → 1448.48] Yeah.
[1448.66 → 1450.50] Is I've been holding off...
[1450.50 → 1454.16] I don't know if you remember like a year and a half ago when I was trying to buy a Swift.
[1454.22 → 1454.54] It's really great.
[1454.60 → 1454.84] Hold on.
[1455.04 → 1455.16] Yeah.
[1455.24 → 1455.68] Hold that thought.
[1455.78 → 1457.60] People are talking about the Olympics like in 8K.
[1457.94 → 1461.22] So funny because most of the feeds of the Olympics look like they're not even 720.
[1461.44 → 1461.62] Yeah.
[1461.88 → 1462.04] Yeah.
[1462.30 → 1463.76] The CBC feeds are pretty good.
[1463.86 → 1465.54] But yeah, I think they're probably about 720.
[1466.82 → 1467.72] But they're pretty good.
[1467.72 → 1472.48] But yeah, I wanted to buy a Swift like a year and a half abolish.
[1472.56 → 1473.24] The new monitor.
[1473.64 → 1480.20] My monitors right now will just black screen for one to three seconds at a time.
[1480.24 → 1480.40] Yeah.
[1480.82 → 1481.18] Randomly.
[1481.22 → 1481.46] Okay.
[1481.56 → 1482.30] Because they're dying.
[1482.60 → 1482.76] Yeah.
[1482.82 → 1483.96] I've had them for quite a while.
[1484.10 → 1484.58] It's okay.
[1485.50 → 1485.82] Yeah.
[1486.24 → 1488.24] You've had them since like the NCI Tech Tips days.
[1488.38 → 1488.52] Yeah.
[1488.78 → 1489.08] Okay.
[1489.24 → 1490.34] Yeah, you got your mileage out of them.
[1490.34 → 1491.18] They're doing an okay.
[1491.18 → 1491.54] Yeah.
[1491.70 → 1491.86] Yeah.
[1491.92 → 1493.52] It's a little early, I think.
[1493.70 → 1497.32] But like it's early in the lasted a long time range.
[1497.70 → 1498.60] So it's fine.
[1499.22 → 1502.52] But yeah, I've needed a new monitor for a while because they're black screening on me like
[1502.52 → 1502.84] pretty.
[1503.04 → 1507.04] And I'll be the worst thing is like if I'm playing Counter-Strike and the screen goes
[1507.04 → 1508.36] black, and then I get flash bang.
[1508.40 → 1508.84] And you're dead.
[1509.64 → 1510.50] Well, it's yeah.
[1510.58 → 1512.12] Because the screen goes black, and I'm like, crap.
[1512.20 → 1516.28] I need to like hide and wait for the one to three seconds that my screen is black.
[1516.28 → 1518.42] And then I come back in and someone's flash banged me.
[1518.42 → 1522.06] So I'm like, first, pure black to extreme white.
[1522.16 → 1523.52] Now I'm just like, oh, goodness.
[1523.96 → 1525.12] Still can't see for a while.
[1525.12 → 1525.96] Here comes another three seconds.
[1526.14 → 1526.38] Yeah.
[1526.88 → 1527.88] Just need to wait.
[1528.22 → 1529.02] It's terrible.
[1529.18 → 1532.78] So anyway, I've been waiting for that Asus monitor that I saw at CES.
[1533.30 → 1535.72] Not this year, but the year previously.
[1536.02 → 1537.66] The 144 hertz 4K.
[1537.78 → 1539.96] It has every buzzword you could ever want.
[1539.98 → 1540.58] It's still not out.
[1540.68 → 1543.50] I would be shocked if it hasn't landed in the next couple of months.
[1544.38 → 1547.98] Just that's, I'm not going to say what I know, but I'll say that I,
[1547.98 → 1549.34] I would be shocked.
[1549.50 → 1549.76] Okay.
[1549.94 → 1550.80] Reason number five.
[1551.10 → 1551.40] Okay.
[1551.48 → 1552.62] Everyone is making me say it.
[1553.24 → 1553.68] Pornography.
[1555.96 → 1557.28] Actually, that would be horrible.
[1557.54 → 1558.34] Don't do that.
[1561.92 → 1566.94] You'd have literally like three pixels to the width of every pubic hair.
[1568.30 → 1569.96] Nobody is asking for this.
[1570.60 → 1570.92] Nobody.
[1571.64 → 1572.62] At a certain point.
[1572.62 → 1574.94] If you think you're asking for this, you're not asking for this.
[1574.94 → 1577.28] At a certain point, it's better to leave it up to the imagination.
[1577.86 → 1579.70] To like, just a little bit.
[1580.40 → 1580.76] Okay.
[1581.88 → 1582.28] Okay.
[1582.54 → 1588.40] And speaking of imagination, I can imagine that it's going to be tough for Colton to sign up these sponsors ever again.
[1588.40 → 1592.24] Honey.
[1594.04 → 1594.76] Oh, wow.
[1594.98 → 1595.20] Oh, yeah.
[1595.24 → 1596.34] No, we've worked with these guys before.
[1596.46 → 1603.28] So Honey is a free browser extension that automatically finds the best coupons on the web so that you always get the best prices on stuff you buy.
[1603.28 → 1611.68] So while you shop, Honey will instantly find every working coupon code that it can and automatically apply the best discount to your card at checkout.
[1612.02 → 1615.42] So it saves you time because they test coupon codes for you.
[1615.66 → 1617.92] They test over a million coupon codes a month.
[1618.20 → 1622.84] And they've partnered with lots of online retailers like eBay and New egg to help you find the best deals.
[1623.16 → 1624.76] They don't sell your personal information.
[1624.76 → 1632.42] In some cases, when you use a coupon with Honey, they earn a small commission from the merchant, but they don't sell your data or give your information to third parties either.
[1633.14 → 1637.12] So basically, there's no reason not to add Honey to your browser if you shop online.
[1637.32 → 1639.88] It's free and takes just two clicks to install and saves you money.
[1640.22 → 1645.00] So go to joinhoney.com slash Linus or click the link below, which you can't do because you're watching.
[1645.10 → 1646.04] Oh, click that link below.
[1646.12 → 1647.12] Well, you can't click it, but whatever.
[1647.20 → 1647.56] You get it.
[1647.80 → 1650.76] Joinhoney.com slash Linus and try it out today.
[1650.76 → 1654.12] In other news, oh, this is great.
[1654.24 → 1656.08] I am so hungry right now.
[1657.08 → 1657.82] Savage jerky.
[1658.84 → 1661.66] The box of jerky is so heavy, I can't lift it.
[1662.66 → 1663.76] I thought it just ripped.
[1663.76 → 1664.34] Back again.
[1665.46 → 1668.06] I'm going to have to pace myself on the maple buffalo bacon.
[1668.72 → 1670.72] I had an entire pack last week.
[1670.86 → 1672.00] During the show and after the show.
[1672.00 → 1673.62] Right, you were munched on it after the show.
[1673.62 → 1676.00] Oh, I was munching the heck out of that after the show.
[1676.22 → 1677.14] What do you want this week?
[1677.34 → 1677.74] I'm down.
[1677.92 → 1678.96] You want the traditional?
[1679.44 → 1679.74] Sure.
[1679.74 → 1681.74] I'm going to do the cracked pepper and sea salt.
[1681.90 → 1684.00] That actually sounds pretty good, but I'll go something else.
[1684.16 → 1684.54] Okay.
[1685.06 → 1685.92] Traditional sounds good.
[1685.96 → 1687.90] Just don't touch my maple buffalo bacon, and we're good.
[1687.98 → 1688.48] No, that's fine.
[1688.54 → 1689.10] Oh, you know what?
[1689.40 → 1691.04] I don't think we have any traditional.
[1691.30 → 1691.90] Oh, there we go.
[1692.10 → 1693.00] Oh, in the new package.
[1693.16 → 1694.74] Oh, new package traditional.
[1694.96 → 1695.20] Perfect.
[1695.40 → 1696.34] So Savage jerky.
[1697.02 → 1702.20] Their goal was to create a snack made with the best ingredients without nitrates or preservatives
[1702.20 → 1705.82] that wasn't bad for you, but that was full of flavour and spice.
[1705.92 → 1706.90] I'm like drooling right now.
[1707.26 → 1708.90] I'm like actually really excited.
[1708.90 → 1712.38] Not drooling, salivating, but it hasn't come out of my mouth, so it's not drool yet, I guess.
[1713.44 → 1715.68] They've got 13 different flavours of jerky.
[1716.16 → 1721.74] Some of our personal favourites are the maple buffalo bacon, the mojo, the...
[1721.74 → 1723.08] I like the cracked pepper and sea salt.
[1723.12 → 1726.28] I don't think you're as big a fan of this one, but Luke loves the traditional.
[1726.62 → 1728.34] I'm not as into the traditional.
[1729.36 → 1730.34] What else is perfect?
[1730.36 → 1733.70] I think it depends on kind of like what mode I'm in.
[1733.70 → 1740.10] And then if you have a fire hall that lives like in your mouth, then you're into the like really spicy stuff,
[1740.32 → 1742.22] they've got all kinds of flavours for you.
[1742.32 → 1749.76] Everything from Carolina Reapers to ghost peppers to like truly spicy frigging jerky.
[1750.12 → 1751.48] And they don't just have jerky.
[1751.56 → 1752.52] They do a spice rub.
[1752.52 → 1754.34] They've got barbecue sauce, hot sauce.
[1754.94 → 1756.18] I haven't tried their hot sauce.
[1756.26 → 1757.42] I should actually try it.
[1757.66 → 1758.80] I love hot sauce.
[1758.84 → 1760.30] They've never sent us the hot sauce.
[1760.42 → 1760.50] Yeah.
[1761.06 → 1763.14] They should give us that hookup.
[1763.16 → 1765.96] Their Carolina Reaper hot sauce uses one of the hottest peppers in the world.
[1766.50 → 1771.38] So go check it out at dini.us or apparently savagejerky.com.
[1771.48 → 1774.32] Yeah, just go to savagejerky.com and use offer code LTT.
[1774.74 → 1775.18] There we go.
[1776.46 → 1776.82] Easy.
[1776.82 → 1776.86] Easy.
[1778.30 → 1778.86] All right.
[1780.42 → 1782.04] So what else do we want to talk about today?
[1782.88 → 1783.22] Oh, yeah.
[1783.62 → 1784.34] That's kind of interesting.
[1784.96 → 1785.26] Full ping?
[1787.06 → 1788.06] Can we do this one first?
[1788.20 → 1788.60] No, it's fine.
[1788.60 → 1788.82] It's pretty funny.
[1789.22 → 1789.36] Yeah.
[1789.58 → 1790.32] I just don't want to forget.
[1790.96 → 1794.40] This was originally posted by monkeybiz0985 on the forum.
[1794.50 → 1796.62] The original article here is from bbc.com.
[1797.22 → 1798.46] Are we going to ignore the...
[1798.46 → 1800.56] No, let's just use the name because I mean it's right here.
[1800.56 → 1801.00] Yeah.
[1802.00 → 1806.56] Kylie Jenner is apparently so over Snapchat.
[1806.82 → 1809.06] And their shares tumble.
[1810.08 → 1814.18] Single-handedly with evidently a single tweet.
[1814.68 → 1815.24] Okay.
[1816.20 → 1828.58] Well, $1.3 billion was wiped off of Snap's stock market value after she tweeted that she is no longer using the app.
[1828.72 → 1829.72] So there are a couple problems here.
[1829.84 → 1829.96] Yeah.
[1830.48 → 1831.06] Go ahead.
[1831.16 → 1831.68] You go first.
[1831.68 → 1832.86] I'm going to add a couple.
[1833.10 → 1835.04] One, it jumps right before the fall.
[1835.04 → 1836.88] I'll pull that up.
[1838.22 → 1838.52] There you go.
[1838.52 → 1842.66] And it also looks like a somewhat natural pattern fall.
[1842.80 → 1844.56] And there are bigger dips here.
[1844.94 → 1846.54] That's not even the main one.
[1846.60 → 1849.16] But what's interesting about it is just that it happens instantly.
[1849.50 → 1849.94] Oh, sure.
[1850.24 → 1850.48] Yeah.
[1850.48 → 1855.44] Also, there's been a lot of doubt sewn around Snapchat for a while now.
[1855.44 → 1857.16] And you can see they're trending down.
[1857.40 → 1859.16] They're super trending down.
[1859.24 → 1863.60] Like, to be clear, guys, this is only the last five days.
[1863.60 → 1867.22] And, like, all of this concatenated into one date.
[1867.30 → 1869.78] Like, that's almost a straight line, too.
[1870.06 → 1870.26] Yeah.
[1870.66 → 1874.42] And, like, Marquez recently had, I think he released a whole video.
[1875.08 → 1875.36] Did he?
[1875.62 → 1878.94] About, like, leaving Snapchat or not liking Snapchat or something.
[1879.08 → 1879.30] Yeah.
[1879.50 → 1880.12] Let's see here.
[1880.68 → 1882.20] Can I talk about problem number two?
[1882.50 → 1883.22] Actually, okay.
[1883.28 → 1887.58] So problem number two is, like, why do people care that much with this?
[1887.68 → 1888.00] Okay.
[1888.06 → 1888.40] You know what?
[1888.44 → 1889.10] No, I get it.
[1889.26 → 1889.48] Okay.
[1889.48 → 1891.00] I cared about Marquez's opinion.
[1891.02 → 1894.80] Prominent influencer isn't using a social platform.
[1895.02 → 1895.38] Do your Snapchat.
[1895.52 → 1896.80] 1.7 million views.
[1897.06 → 1898.62] That's from two weeks ago, though.
[1898.62 → 1898.86] Two weeks ago.
[1899.04 → 1899.44] No, I know.
[1899.52 → 1902.18] But I'm saying there's been a lot of doubt sewn for a little while.
[1902.18 → 1902.50] Okay, so fine, fine, fine.
[1902.70 → 1907.32] So whatever you might think or not think about keeping up with the Kardashians or whatever,
[1908.84 → 1912.92] you can't argue that they've been successful at exploiting social media.
[1912.92 → 1912.96] Yeah.
[1914.46 → 1922.24] So if they are, like, so over Snapchat, then that does actually seem relevant from a shareholder perspective.
[1923.38 → 1928.28] Problem number the last for me is why did anyone ever give a crap about Snapchat?
[1928.46 → 1929.10] I don't get it.
[1931.90 → 1933.66] I've disliked it the entire time.
[1933.66 → 1942.18] This is now two platforms that I have just not really gotten, and I've had a lot of people putting pressure on me because I'm supposed to be in the social media space.
[1942.56 → 1953.00] These are two platforms now, Vine and Snapchat, that I've just, like, not really gotten that have ultimately ended up disappearing, and I haven't had to participate in them.
[1953.14 → 1953.32] Yeah.
[1953.32 → 1956.14] I bought into Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.
[1956.42 → 1957.32] Not like I don't own shares.
[1957.46 → 1960.48] I mean, like, I was, like, YouTube, obviously, as well.
[1960.48 → 1968.74] But, like, those are the ones that I kind of went, yeah, okay, I'll invest the time to bother to develop these things and, like, learn how they work and stuff.
[1969.28 → 1969.46] Yeah.
[1970.42 → 1972.48] Those two didn't get it.
[1972.72 → 1979.64] As far as I could tell, Snapchat's entire value was trendiness, which means that as soon as you're not trendy, where's your value?
[1979.90 → 1980.08] Yeah.
[1980.56 → 1982.50] And someone in the Twitch chat said nudes.
[1983.48 → 1986.12] And, like, even then, that doesn't really make any sense.
[1986.18 → 1987.38] Why don't you just send nudes by email?
[1987.66 → 1988.74] Like, I don't understand.
[1988.86 → 1989.96] What's the special value?
[1989.96 → 1991.08] Well, yeah.
[1991.32 → 1993.18] Well, part of the idea was that it would disappear.
[1993.66 → 1997.16] But since forever, everyone's known that you can just screenshot or record.
[1997.24 → 1997.48] Of course.
[1998.24 → 2000.24] Did anyone ever not realize that?
[2000.78 → 2001.12] Yeah.
[2001.82 → 2002.24] Really?
[2002.96 → 2004.18] I think people didn't.
[2005.32 → 2005.54] What?
[2005.54 → 2006.36] But then that's volatile.
[2006.78 → 2009.22] And now, if you screenshot or record, it tells the person.
[2010.90 → 2014.46] So now it, like, sends them a message saying that you screenshot it.
[2014.46 → 2019.64] So now it's just, like, kind of awkward, I think.
[2020.58 → 2021.20] I don't know.
[2021.66 → 2023.02] You're preaching to the choir a little bit.
[2023.12 → 2024.90] I've never liked Snapchat to any degree.
[2024.90 → 2030.68] The only reason why I have it right now is my brother sends me random things every once in a while.
[2030.74 → 2031.78] Because he prefers Snapchat.
[2033.56 → 2034.00] Okay.
[2034.28 → 2035.14] And that's about it.
[2036.34 → 2036.64] Huh.
[2037.46 → 2040.16] How else am I going to send my nudes, says Elusive Soul?
[2041.00 → 2041.88] Any other.
[2042.28 → 2045.68] You can literally even send them through Instagram direct messages.
[2045.68 → 2045.94] Okay.
[2046.04 → 2046.26] Okay.
[2046.32 → 2048.22] We've got a perfect segue into your float plane stuff.
[2048.34 → 2049.40] Citizen something.
[2049.56 → 2050.82] Citizen IEM something.
[2051.60 → 2053.24] Does float plane work in the UK?
[2053.92 → 2054.10] Yes.
[2054.10 → 2055.20] Remember that thing you told me today?
[2056.02 → 2056.38] Oh.
[2056.60 → 2056.86] Yeah.
[2057.62 → 2057.86] Go ahead.
[2057.94 → 2059.28] I'm going to pull up what's on there.
[2059.34 → 2060.80] And you go ahead and talk about that.
[2060.84 → 2061.46] Because that's pretty cool.
[2061.52 → 2062.50] We have a viewer from.
[2062.54 → 2063.78] I didn't even know you read that message.
[2063.88 → 2064.26] I thought you didn't.
[2064.38 → 2065.60] We have a viewer from Antarctica.
[2066.04 → 2066.58] And it works.
[2068.34 → 2068.70] Wow.
[2069.06 → 2069.94] He had a payment problem.
[2069.94 → 2071.02] Which is unsurprising.
[2072.42 → 2073.62] But it works.
[2073.72 → 2074.30] Which is great.
[2074.30 → 2076.16] Like payment problem has been solved.
[2077.06 → 2077.18] Yeah.
[2077.40 → 2080.10] So we can see a map of wherever.
[2080.18 → 2080.38] Oh, no.
[2080.40 → 2081.08] He just told me.
[2081.30 → 2081.50] But yeah.
[2081.58 → 2082.00] Oh, okay.
[2082.08 → 2083.08] Well, we can see that too.
[2084.32 → 2085.20] And it's really cool.
[2085.26 → 2087.64] Because the audience is shockingly global.
[2087.72 → 2088.60] It's very distributed.
[2088.78 → 2088.92] Yeah.
[2089.26 → 2089.42] Yeah.
[2089.56 → 2090.02] All right.
[2090.08 → 2090.24] Let's have a look.
[2090.24 → 2091.10] Which is cool and scary.
[2091.22 → 2092.80] Because we have to manage all of that.
[2092.94 → 2093.70] What do we get here?
[2094.08 → 2095.36] Oh, there's some good stuff in here.
[2096.38 → 2097.96] Who needs more CPU cores?
[2098.76 → 2100.30] This is finally going up.
[2100.74 → 2101.12] Wow.
[2101.12 → 2103.94] So this is kind of an explainer of Core i7 versus Core i9.
[2103.94 → 2105.16] As you can tell, it is sponsored.
[2106.86 → 2108.82] Liquid metal in a phone.
[2109.98 → 2111.10] Is this the first?
[2111.86 → 2114.40] I believe the laptop is the first one.
[2114.54 → 2114.74] Okay.
[2114.84 → 2115.36] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2115.50 → 2116.56] So the follow-up.
[2116.66 → 2118.48] The follow-up to liquid metal in a laptop.
[2118.72 → 2119.70] It's actually shocking.
[2119.92 → 2122.20] I was going to say, this might even be more interesting for a lot of people.
[2122.38 → 2122.56] Yeah.
[2123.14 → 2124.78] The one-year airflow experiment.
[2125.22 → 2127.84] The stunning conclusion is apparently missing a proper thumbnail.
[2127.96 → 2129.14] So I'll go hit someone after the show.
[2129.14 → 2130.40] But that's up.
[2130.76 → 2131.32] It's done.
[2131.44 → 2131.98] It's ready.
[2132.34 → 2132.60] Wow.
[2132.64 → 2133.46] That's a lot of views.
[2134.08 → 2134.44] Yeah.
[2135.14 → 2135.54] Wow.
[2135.74 → 2136.82] There's a lot of discussion too.
[2137.04 → 2138.08] But yeah.
[2139.32 → 2141.92] Buying, selling, and safely storing Bitcoin.
[2142.08 → 2143.66] Mining Adventure Part 4 is up.
[2143.74 → 2146.22] So we go through some of the wallet options.
[2146.48 → 2147.64] Some of the exchange options.
[2147.64 → 2149.66] Just kind of help people understand it a little bit better.
[2149.68 → 2153.40] The whole Twitch chat is flipping out that we finally are releasing the airflow video.
[2153.50 → 2154.46] It's finally happening.
[2154.78 → 2155.88] It's on float plane now.
[2156.06 → 2156.32] Yep.
[2156.58 → 2157.66] You can go watch it right now.
[2157.76 → 2160.64] Copula isn't a brand that most people will probably have heard of.
[2161.30 → 2162.98] But this product is very cool.
[2163.32 → 2169.42] It is a passively cooled, small form factor gaming machine with a GTX 1060 or 70.
[2171.08 → 2172.18] I think it's a 1060.
[2172.46 → 2173.10] Maybe a 1070.
[2173.30 → 2173.76] I don't remember.
[2173.94 → 2174.52] It's perfect though.
[2174.52 → 2178.22] Oh, no.
[2178.28 → 2179.92] That went up on YouTube.
[2180.74 → 2181.50] That went up on YouTube.
[2181.52 → 2182.86] I think we're probably YouTube range now.
[2182.96 → 2183.46] I think we're, probably.
[2183.62 → 2183.78] Yep.
[2183.86 → 2184.04] Yep.
[2184.16 → 2185.60] There might be something left.
[2186.88 → 2187.54] No, I think that's most.
[2187.76 → 2188.00] Oh.
[2188.62 → 2191.66] I don't know if Handy Tech Under 100 Mostly Gaming went up on YouTube.
[2192.26 → 2192.72] Maybe it did.
[2194.24 → 2194.48] Anyway.
[2194.88 → 2195.34] Oh, yeah.
[2195.48 → 2197.96] 120 hertz PC gaming on a TV still hasn't hit YouTube.
[2197.96 → 2204.04] So the reason for that is that when we're scheduling,
[2204.52 → 2210.44] it's a lot easier to push something by a week than it is to push something by a day.
[2211.74 → 2212.50] So for whatever reason,
[2212.54 → 2215.14] we have a simultaneous release that we have to do on a day when something's scheduled.
[2215.24 → 2217.84] It usually gets bumped like the same day the following week.
[2217.88 → 2219.34] And I think it's happened to that one twice.
[2221.74 → 2222.36] It'll come.
[2222.68 → 2222.88] Yeah.
[2223.10 → 2223.50] It'll come.
[2223.50 → 2226.66] All right.
[2226.70 → 2227.34] What else we got today?
[2227.34 → 2227.84] Yeah.
[2233.30 → 2233.82] Wow.
[2234.78 → 2238.08] Apparently Snap CEO was paid $637 million last year.
[2239.16 → 2242.80] Thought to be the third-highest annual package ever received by a company's CEO.
[2243.22 → 2245.52] So this is in spite of them being under pressure for Instagram,
[2246.08 → 2250.02] like taking all their key features and users complaining about the redesign.
[2251.56 → 2252.04] Brilliant.
[2252.04 → 2256.10] All right.
[2256.10 → 2256.66] What else we got here?
[2256.70 → 2258.66] Pull out as much as we can as fast as possible.
[2258.68 → 2259.12] I know, right?
[2259.22 → 2259.54] Personally.
[2259.68 → 2260.46] Pull it all out personally.
[2260.52 → 2260.72] Yeah.
[2260.86 → 2261.04] Yeah.
[2262.00 → 2262.28] Samsung.
[2262.62 → 2263.24] Speaking of which,
[2263.38 → 2265.04] the NCI auction was a lot of fun.
[2266.10 → 2266.44] Yeah.
[2266.54 → 2268.64] Do you want to talk about that all or are we going to leave it in the video?
[2268.80 → 2270.86] So there's actually going to be two videos.
[2270.86 → 2271.18] Okay.
[2271.26 → 2272.82] I don't know if people even knew that it was happening.
[2272.96 → 2273.12] Yeah.
[2273.12 → 2273.44] Maybe we should.
[2273.44 → 2279.24] So NCI had their bankruptcy auction on Wednesday and Thursday of this week.
[2279.48 → 2282.26] So I had gone in intending to make one video,
[2282.66 → 2287.10] but honestly, it would be like, it would be too long.
[2287.46 → 2287.56] Yeah.
[2287.60 → 2287.80] Okay.
[2287.98 → 2288.24] Or that.
[2288.44 → 2290.82] We would have to cut too much, or it would be too long.
[2290.96 → 2292.60] And it's two different days even.
[2292.74 → 2293.10] And it is.
[2293.10 → 2293.90] So it makes sense.
[2293.96 → 2294.84] It is across two days.
[2294.84 → 2298.44] I had also intended for it to be like really structured.
[2298.98 → 2300.20] Here's some stuff we found.
[2300.32 → 2301.36] Here's some stuff we bought.
[2301.48 → 2302.40] Here's how much we paid.
[2302.60 → 2303.22] See ya.
[2303.98 → 2308.94] And what it really turned into was more like me and Ed digging around the warehouse
[2308.94 → 2310.64] and like finding relics.
[2310.72 → 2312.34] Like I found a computer that I built.
[2312.40 → 2313.04] That's what, yeah.
[2313.28 → 2313.76] In the warehouse.
[2314.06 → 2314.32] Yeah.
[2314.48 → 2317.06] Do you remember the one with the flames airbrushed on it?
[2317.10 → 2317.32] Yeah.
[2318.00 → 2321.56] That still has the original build that I did in it like eight years ago.
[2321.90 → 2324.04] And it was just like sitting in a pile in the warehouse.
[2324.04 → 2327.30] I really wanted to go just for that kind of reason.
[2327.46 → 2330.04] Like I wanted to go back to the original filming room and stuff.
[2330.38 → 2332.44] But like I just, I didn't have the time.
[2332.44 → 2334.32] It was, it was pretty, it was pretty fun.
[2334.38 → 2334.94] It was sentimental.
[2335.44 → 2335.50] Yeah.
[2335.58 → 2337.06] You know, there was some funny stuff.
[2337.10 → 2338.90] I'll get my sentimentality out of the video.
[2339.16 → 2339.60] I'll watch the video.
[2339.60 → 2340.78] There was some kind of sad stuff.
[2340.92 → 2347.48] Like I come across like the box of sort of her stuff to work with every day.
[2347.48 → 2351.20] Like her gloves and like, you know, personal effects.
[2351.34 → 2352.64] Not personal effects, company effects.
[2352.80 → 2356.90] But that like her box of like stuff that she needed by her scanning station for like someone
[2356.90 → 2361.66] who was really nice and that worked there a long time and worked hard and was as far as
[2361.66 → 2366.60] I could tell, very nice, good person and just doesn't have a job anymore because of mismanagement.
[2367.28 → 2368.96] So there was like some sad stuff.
[2370.20 → 2371.58] There's some random stuff.
[2371.84 → 2374.96] At one point, Ed and I leave the auction, and we go play squash.
[2374.96 → 2377.34] Did you guys film that?
[2377.68 → 2377.90] Yeah.
[2380.44 → 2385.92] I've never tried squash before, which of course is a perfectly legitimate reason to be playing squash.
[2386.12 → 2386.34] Definitely.
[2386.34 → 2388.14] Like when you're supposed to be at work making a video.
[2388.28 → 2388.62] Totally.
[2390.62 → 2391.02] So.
[2391.22 → 2393.80] No one at float plate is allowed to absorb that mentality.
[2394.00 → 2394.22] Hooray.
[2394.38 → 2394.62] All right.
[2394.68 → 2394.86] Yeah.
[2394.86 → 2395.58] Continue moving forward.
[2395.58 → 2398.22] So anyway, it ends up being two vlogs.
[2399.32 → 2404.86] A vlog for day one of like digging through everything because that was when they had the viewing time.
[2404.96 → 2407.54] When you were allowed to go in and like pick through all the different auction lots.
[2407.66 → 2407.80] Yeah.
[2408.04 → 2410.72] And then part two where we attend the actual auction.
[2411.66 → 2412.50] I tried.
[2414.00 → 2414.58] You know what?
[2414.60 → 2415.58] No, I'm not going to talk about it.
[2417.14 → 2417.60] Oh, yeah.
[2417.60 → 2418.70] We should probably talk about LTX.
[2418.88 → 2419.54] That's pretty cool.
[2419.66 → 2420.12] Oh, yeah.
[2420.16 → 2420.88] LTX is happening.
[2421.06 → 2421.18] Right.
[2422.30 → 2422.66] Yeah.
[2422.72 → 2424.32] So where we actually go to the auction.
[2424.32 → 2427.92] We, you know, do auction things.
[2428.04 → 2429.06] We leave the auction.
[2429.68 → 2430.70] We run into Julia.
[2432.16 → 2432.32] Oh.
[2433.58 → 2434.74] What's that café called?
[2434.90 → 2435.96] It starts with a Z, I think.
[2436.24 → 2436.54] Via's.
[2436.74 → 2436.92] Yeah.
[2437.06 → 2438.40] We run into Julia at Via's.
[2438.60 → 2442.54] We talk about like the stuff that people are buying probably being broken.
[2442.76 → 2443.64] Do you know what she's doing now?
[2443.70 → 2443.88] Yeah.
[2443.94 → 2445.04] She's at Mike's Computer Shop.
[2445.10 → 2445.26] Yeah.
[2445.52 → 2445.72] Yeah.
[2445.84 → 2446.84] She's like back on YouTube.
[2447.10 → 2447.74] So there you go.
[2448.02 → 2448.16] Yeah.
[2448.16 → 2448.20] Yeah.
[2448.40 → 2453.48] So she was very, she wasn't tacky about it.
[2454.32 → 2459.98] When, when she, well, sometimes people will go on camera and will be like, hi, yeah, you
[2459.98 → 2462.10] guys might remember me from NCI Tech Tips.
[2462.16 → 2463.34] I'm with Mike's Computer Shop now.
[2463.42 → 2464.24] Go see Mike's Computer Shop.
[2464.30 → 2465.32] No, she was very good about it.
[2465.38 → 2469.42] So that's, that's why Julia gets the shout-out for being at Mike's Computer Shop on the
[2469.42 → 2470.20] lunch show right now.
[2470.20 → 2470.26] Cool.
[2470.48 → 2470.66] Yeah.
[2470.66 → 2471.18] Yep.
[2471.72 → 2471.96] Yep.
[2472.40 → 2474.18] Good, good, good form.
[2474.36 → 2474.84] Good form.
[2474.96 → 2475.20] You know?
[2477.38 → 2478.38] What did you want to talk about?
[2478.44 → 2478.76] Oh, right.
[2478.82 → 2479.30] LTD.
[2479.30 → 2485.18] So, yes, we know, we know LTX Expo is redundant.
[2485.76 → 2485.94] Yeah.
[2485.94 → 2491.90] Um, but like you guys go find a seven character dot com domain.
[2492.54 → 2493.44] I challenge you.
[2494.54 → 2495.24] That's right.
[2495.46 → 2496.48] That's what I thought.
[2496.84 → 2498.72] There's, there's going to be a lot of responses.
[2499.26 → 2499.46] Yeah.
[2499.46 → 2501.62] Because people will just find like bubble dot com.
[2501.62 → 2502.32] They'll be pretty dumb.
[2502.40 → 2502.62] Yeah.
[2502.62 → 2506.38] So we got a bunch of information here.
[2507.40 → 2509.42] Um, I don't know if we have any partners yet.
[2509.52 → 2511.20] So that's probably, that's probably empty.
[2511.46 → 2511.62] Yep.
[2512.58 → 2512.86] Lol.
[2513.52 → 2514.50] Hey, Corsair's in.
[2515.48 → 2515.88] Cool.
[2515.96 → 2518.32] Also, oh, this is last year.
[2518.52 → 2518.90] Oh, my partner.
[2518.98 → 2520.98] I told me you really need to put that on another page, but.
[2521.00 → 2522.04] Yeah, that's really terrible.
[2522.22 → 2523.40] Or just not anywhere.
[2523.64 → 2523.86] Yeah.
[2523.92 → 2524.88] It just probably shouldn't be there.
[2524.88 → 2526.28] Or like it should be smaller or something.
[2526.80 → 2526.94] Yeah.
[2527.70 → 2528.44] It's freaking huge.
[2528.66 → 2529.42] Um, yeah.
[2529.54 → 2530.64] So that probably doesn't make a ton of sense.
[2530.84 → 2532.40] But, um, yeah, we got, you know, partners.
[2532.40 → 2532.90] We got a map.
[2533.86 → 2534.68] Map and schedules.
[2534.92 → 2536.44] Oh, that's coming soon too.
[2536.56 → 2537.68] This is a really helpful website.
[2538.06 → 2541.32] So it's good that it's subject to change.
[2541.44 → 2546.32] Because if it wasn't going to change, and it was just coming soon forever, then that would be bad.
[2546.46 → 2546.60] Yeah.
[2547.82 → 2548.22] Okay.
[2548.40 → 2549.04] Hold on a second.
[2549.14 → 2551.58] So here's an event map coming soon, but you can download it.
[2552.50 → 2552.86] Nope.
[2552.98 → 2553.32] Nope.
[2553.40 → 2554.70] That just takes you back to this page.
[2555.02 → 2557.76] So it was built on Squarespace, but it was built by monkeys.
[2558.24 → 2559.94] So it goes to show you Squarespace.
[2560.52 → 2563.22] Beautiful website, but you actually still do have to like...
[2563.22 → 2563.92] It still looks good.
[2564.10 → 2564.26] Yeah.
[2564.30 → 2564.80] It looks good.
[2564.90 → 2565.72] And it's fast.
[2567.00 → 2567.32] Gallery.
[2568.06 → 2568.76] Oh, so here's a gallery.
[2568.86 → 2574.86] So a lot of people thought that LTX was just like small or lame or whatever.
[2575.46 → 2576.58] And, you know, it was a little small.
[2576.66 → 2577.22] It was a little lame.
[2577.22 → 2579.38] But it was actually a lot of fun.
[2579.70 → 2579.88] Uh-huh.
[2580.36 → 2582.22] We had an absolute blast last year.
[2582.34 → 2584.64] So here's a bunch of the stuff from last year.
[2585.08 → 2586.54] A bunch of the stuff that people could do.
[2587.00 → 2587.68] This year...
[2587.68 → 2588.32] Not shilling.
[2588.74 → 2590.46] Legitimately one of my favourite conventions in years.
[2591.18 → 2596.22] This one is going to be a lot more emphasis on...
[2596.22 → 2601.04] Like the one piece of feedback we got from people was that they could come in for two hours
[2601.04 → 2602.08] and they could kind of do everything.
[2603.00 → 2608.12] So the idea this year is it's a one-day event, and we want to make it so that it's basically
[2608.12 → 2609.24] impossible to do everything.
[2609.68 → 2609.82] Hmm.
[2610.62 → 2610.88] Cool.
[2610.88 → 2619.02] So every booth needs to have enough to see or do that you can't do everything.
[2619.52 → 2621.28] And one of the other things that...
[2621.28 → 2624.30] This wasn't external feedback, but one of the other things that we thought that we needed
[2624.30 → 2630.00] to improve was there was a lot of stuff to do at LTX to the point where it would actually
[2630.00 → 2635.24] take you all day if you were to try every carnival game and participate in everything.
[2635.90 → 2637.36] But there wasn't much of an incentive.
[2637.36 → 2641.88] So I think a lot of people ended up kind of like crowding into a corner and like chatting
[2641.88 → 2643.08] with each other or whatever else.
[2643.48 → 2643.84] Sorry.
[2644.24 → 2645.32] Oh yeah, we could figure that out.
[2645.38 → 2645.60] Anyway.
[2646.96 → 2649.82] So a lot of people ended up kind of not doing everything.
[2650.46 → 2654.20] And then we ended up giving away a ton of like prizes randomly at the end in a raffle.
[2654.80 → 2656.26] So this time...
[2656.26 → 2656.44] Cool.
[2656.68 → 2657.06] I love it.
[2657.06 → 2664.38] There's going to be like mono prizes for like going on the bungee run or for throwing cases
[2664.38 → 2667.48] as far as you can or whatever else the case may be.
[2667.96 → 2668.54] And I think...
[2668.54 → 2670.18] Are you going to do like the Explorer's Pass?
[2670.50 → 2670.94] This is a...
[2670.94 → 2673.32] And you hand in the Explorer's Pass for a ticket for the raffle?
[2673.84 → 2676.52] And the Explorer's Pass has to get stamped at all the different booths once you complete
[2676.52 → 2676.98] the activity?
[2677.42 → 2678.26] Oh, that's interesting.
[2678.62 → 2678.80] Yeah.
[2678.86 → 2679.70] That's a good idea too.
[2679.76 → 2680.48] I've been to a lot of conventions.
[2680.48 → 2685.46] I was actually about to say one of the things that we should probably do is also enter people
[2685.46 → 2687.44] just for participating in lots of stuff.
[2687.52 → 2688.38] So yeah, that would be great.
[2688.44 → 2689.16] That would be a lot of fun.
[2689.16 → 2693.66] I like the combination of like if you get past a certain threshold, like if you beat
[2693.66 → 2695.96] like 90% of people at this thing or whatever.
[2696.10 → 2697.40] And at the beginning of the day, maybe it's easier.
[2697.70 → 2697.72] Yeah.
[2697.72 → 2698.34] Colton's nodding.
[2698.42 → 2699.02] Colton's into it.
[2699.94 → 2700.26] Cool.
[2700.36 → 2700.46] Yeah.
[2701.02 → 2701.60] So it's good.
[2701.68 → 2701.78] Yeah.
[2701.78 → 2702.66] We're going to have a lot of fun.
[2702.74 → 2706.06] So go to ltxexpo.com to get very few details, but...
[2706.06 → 2708.38] You can get tickets though, can't you?
[2708.54 → 2708.86] I think so.
[2708.86 → 2712.12] I think you can get tickets right now because I heard the like big tickets already sold out.
[2712.58 → 2712.86] Really?
[2713.16 → 2713.48] Yeah.
[2713.74 → 2714.20] I think so.
[2714.30 → 2714.62] Oh, wow.
[2714.62 → 2720.16] Someone tweeted me saying that they're like, they wanted it, and now they're sad or something.
[2720.34 → 2720.82] I don't know.
[2720.88 → 2721.56] Because it sold out.
[2721.60 → 2721.84] Dang.
[2722.00 → 2722.22] Okay.
[2722.74 → 2728.76] So in a nutshell, we can't really tell you much about it, but unlike last year when we
[2728.76 → 2732.70] were pretty tepid on the land show about sort of how much fun it would be.
[2732.72 → 2733.32] It's going to be fun.
[2733.68 → 2734.26] This year...
[2734.26 → 2734.70] It's going to be really fun.
[2735.16 → 2736.46] This is the tagline, okay?
[2737.64 → 2739.62] We can't tell you much about it, but it'll be fun.
[2739.78 → 2740.24] Trust us.
[2740.36 → 2740.50] Yeah.
[2740.72 → 2742.28] You've got a much bigger venue this time.
[2743.16 → 2744.44] We're going to be at the Richmond Oval.
[2744.62 → 2750.06] As someone who's gone to, at a minimum, one tech slash gaming convention every single
[2750.06 → 2753.08] year for like 14 years or something.
[2753.16 → 2753.28] Yeah.
[2753.50 → 2753.70] Yeah.
[2754.92 → 2759.92] It feels a little bit more like some of the older ones did where there was more stuff to
[2759.92 → 2760.18] do.
[2760.58 → 2764.72] If you go to PAX these days, they're still really cool, but they're mostly like a spectator
[2764.72 → 2768.46] sport kind of situation where you're mostly just like looking at things.
[2768.60 → 2769.88] There isn't a lot of activity.
[2770.06 → 2770.90] There's a lot to look at.
[2770.94 → 2774.42] It takes like two hours to wait through a line to play a game, that kind of stuff.
[2774.62 → 2777.96] What I really liked about the last LTX and seems like it's going to be a thing at this
[2777.96 → 2781.30] one, and you even mentioned, like there has to be enough stuff for people to do.
[2781.42 → 2782.78] You didn't say see, you said do.
[2783.20 → 2784.98] It's fun because there are so many activities.
[2784.98 → 2789.14] Like I don't know if we're bringing it back, but last year there was like hard line water
[2789.14 → 2792.08] tube bending and like all this really cool stuff.
[2792.08 → 2794.08] I think we're going to have a Delia your CPU station.
[2794.24 → 2796.34] See like that's freaking cool.
[2796.54 → 2798.60] So we're hoping to partner with a local retailer.
[2798.76 → 2802.42] So the idea is that you could bring your CPU, and we'd have the tools on hand and someone
[2802.42 → 2802.94] to help you.
[2803.62 → 2807.76] Or if you don't have one, then we'll have a board and a test bench handy so you can like
[2807.76 → 2810.56] buy a new one, and we'll have hopefully a retail partner.
[2810.56 → 2815.34] So you can just buy it on the spot, test it, make sure it works because you'll void your
[2815.34 → 2816.18] warranty instantly.
[2816.44 → 2816.54] Yeah.
[2816.84 → 2818.84] And then you could Delia it and take it home and use it.
[2819.26 → 2820.40] That's pretty sick, actually.
[2820.54 → 2820.68] Yeah.
[2820.74 → 2822.66] So like we've got, we've got ideas.
[2822.76 → 2822.94] Damn.
[2822.98 → 2823.52] That's pretty cool.
[2823.54 → 2824.42] There's some pretty good ideas.
[2824.82 → 2827.00] We could, this might get expensive.
[2827.48 → 2828.08] Oh Lord.
[2828.10 → 2832.46] But we could have some and people could buy it to use, but we could have like a free geek
[2832.46 → 2836.38] CPUs for people just to like to do it with.
[2836.62 → 2836.98] Probably.
[2836.98 → 2837.46] You know what I mean?
[2838.18 → 2840.10] We've got some perfect ideas with free geek.
[2841.04 → 2846.68] So you've seen the like boxes and boxes, like the pallets of stripped motherboard PCBs,
[2846.72 → 2846.84] right?
[2846.98 → 2847.08] Yeah.
[2847.12 → 2847.70] Do you know about this?
[2848.30 → 2848.58] No.
[2848.84 → 2849.08] Okay.
[2849.76 → 2854.14] So one of the ideas that we pitched to, or at least are going to pitch to free geek at
[2854.14 → 2857.56] some point is motherboard house of cards.
[2861.76 → 2866.96] And then over the course of the day, whoever builds the tallest card house out of motherboard
[2866.96 → 2870.32] piece, stripped motherboard PCBs wins a motherboard.
[2870.48 → 2870.74] I don't know.
[2870.78 → 2871.60] Like we'll figure something out.
[2871.60 → 2871.88] Something cool.
[2872.10 → 2872.78] But yeah, just like.
[2873.52 → 2873.92] Cool.
[2874.08 → 2875.42] So it would be kind of like, you know what?
[2875.50 → 2879.48] Like science world when there's just like the booth that's just like a bunch of blocks
[2879.48 → 2880.60] to put together or whatever.
[2880.94 → 2882.18] Oh, so you just kind of walk up.
[2882.22 → 2884.22] There's a little sign explaining what to do, and you just go for it.
[2884.22 → 2887.48] And there's just a box of motherboard PCBs and you just, you build a house.
[2887.48 → 2890.40] And then you just call a free geek person over and go like, look how tall it is.
[2890.48 → 2891.10] And then they write it down.
[2891.10 → 2891.60] And they measure it.
[2891.74 → 2891.98] Yeah.
[2892.32 → 2892.60] Cool.
[2892.68 → 2892.88] Dope, right?
[2892.98 → 2893.16] Yeah.
[2893.24 → 2893.56] That's cool.
[2893.56 → 2893.94] I like it.
[2894.00 → 2894.14] Yeah.
[2894.20 → 2897.98] So that's the that's the kind of stuff that, that we want to do at it.
[2897.98 → 2898.12] Cool.
[2898.84 → 2900.64] Um, what else do we have for topics today?
[2900.76 → 2905.72] What I really liked last year too was with a lot of those kinds of things, you'd run into
[2905.72 → 2911.78] random attendees that would become like, like temporary single serving friends for the show
[2911.78 → 2914.38] because they met doing whatever activity.
[2914.56 → 2914.76] Yep.
[2914.84 → 2918.62] Because they ended up being paired up for whatever reason, or they ended up just being next to
[2918.62 → 2920.04] each other and talking and whatever.
[2920.18 → 2921.26] I thought that was really cool.
[2921.28 → 2921.96] That's a good idea.
[2922.14 → 2922.50] Colton.
[2922.80 → 2922.98] Yeah.
[2923.02 → 2923.32] What's up?
[2923.32 → 2928.34] We should have some activities where people are forced to participate like as a team with
[2928.34 → 2931.52] other people there so that we like to make people mingle.
[2931.58 → 2931.76] Yeah.
[2932.14 → 2932.78] That's a good idea.
[2932.90 → 2933.20] I like it.
[2933.84 → 2935.44] Because that's what you need at tech events.
[2935.82 → 2939.34] You have to force people to talk to each other and get to know each other.
[2939.34 → 2939.40] It helps.
[2939.40 → 2940.24] It helps.
[2943.66 → 2944.46] Oh, Geez.
[2945.48 → 2945.80] Okay.
[2946.32 → 2947.10] More topics?
[2947.48 → 2947.70] Yeah.
[2947.74 → 2948.04] I don't know.
[2948.10 → 2948.80] This is all kind of boring.
[2949.92 → 2951.76] Apparently Apple is going to refresh the AirPods.
[2951.76 → 2953.34] Hooray.
[2954.62 → 2955.52] We need that.
[2956.78 → 2957.18] Okay.
[2957.18 → 2957.68] Okay.
[2957.68 → 2958.66] So I got a Google Home Mini.
[2959.30 → 2962.94] And my idea was a lot of times when I'm working, I'll think of something that I need to remember
[2962.94 → 2963.24] later.
[2963.66 → 2967.64] And it's actually kind of annoying to do the couple steps to get into my phone or whatever.
[2967.64 → 2970.66] And my phone isn't very great at responding to OK Google.
[2971.94 → 2972.68] Yeah, it didn't.
[2972.84 → 2973.42] Even though it's on.
[2973.64 → 2974.16] It's just not.
[2974.40 → 2975.12] I don't know why.
[2975.12 → 2977.20] So I got a Google Home Mini.
[2977.52 → 2981.86] And now, when I talk to the Google Home Mini, 50% of the time, my phone does it too.
[2981.86 → 2986.08] So this is like the issue that I have with.
[2986.20 → 2990.98] So there are a few things that are just kind of broken on Android and just sort of in general,
[2991.04 → 2991.28] I guess.
[2991.94 → 2993.24] Here's one that really bugs me.
[2994.06 → 3000.90] When I swipe away a notification, when I clear all on my phone, do you ever have it happen
[3000.90 → 3004.14] where your phone will just be like buzzing for the next 10 seconds?
[3004.44 → 3004.96] Because it will like.
[3005.52 → 3005.72] It'll like.
[3005.72 → 3006.56] Re-notify all those things.
[3006.56 → 3006.66] Yeah.
[3006.74 → 3012.80] So if I have like 10 email notifications, it'll be like nine, eight, seven as it goes through them.
[3013.44 → 3014.96] And it's just kind of infuriating.
[3014.96 → 3016.58] Oh, mine will also re-find them.
[3016.70 → 3020.82] So once you're fully cleared out, it'll be like, oh, you have a few.
[3021.08 → 3022.30] Throw a watch into the mix.
[3022.44 → 3023.54] It gets really annoying.
[3025.00 → 3025.72] That's not great.
[3025.74 → 3027.00] There was another really stupid.
[3027.12 → 3028.50] Like, just dumb stuff.
[3028.50 → 3034.78] Why is it that Google, in their infinite wisdom, added Mark as Red to their SMS app,
[3035.34 → 3039.72] which is super freaking handy, by the way, like when you drag it, when you just pull down
[3039.72 → 3042.06] the notification, you can reply or Mark as Red.
[3042.28 → 3043.38] Why isn't that not in Gmail?
[3044.34 → 3045.76] Why is that not in Hangouts?
[3046.54 → 3048.50] Why is that not in literally anything else?
[3048.88 → 3049.08] Yeah.
[3049.40 → 3054.50] Because, and this is really frustrating on iOS, on iOS there's no way to Mark a text message
[3054.50 → 3054.94] as unread.
[3054.94 → 3061.16] So if you're like me, and you use Red and Unread as a way to track what you have and haven't
[3061.16 → 3061.88] dealt with yet.
[3062.02 → 3062.20] Yeah.
[3063.22 → 3063.54] I do.
[3064.06 → 3065.56] Why is this so hard?
[3066.04 → 3067.32] I don't get it.
[3067.52 → 3072.44] Another thing with the Google Home Mini is I made it play a song just because I wanted
[3072.44 → 3073.42] to see how the speakers were.
[3073.84 → 3076.50] And then I was like, it's really loud by default.
[3076.50 → 3077.86] And like the speaker isn't very great.
[3078.14 → 3082.58] So I was like, I kept on telling it like, I'm not going to stop doing proper commands,
[3082.68 → 3084.62] but essentially turn the volume down.
[3084.82 → 3085.02] Yeah.
[3085.28 → 3087.58] It inaudibly went down.
[3087.72 → 3087.98] Okay.
[3088.02 → 3088.80] Turn the volume down.
[3088.92 → 3089.12] Okay.
[3089.16 → 3089.90] Turn the volume down.
[3090.00 → 3090.20] Okay.
[3090.24 → 3090.92] Turn the volume down.
[3090.96 → 3091.76] I just kept doing it.
[3091.78 → 3093.84] It was like not noticeably going down.
[3093.94 → 3096.10] So then I was like, turn the volume down a lot.
[3096.10 → 3099.28] And then it went to a completely inaudible level of volume.
[3099.58 → 3103.04] And there's no like, there's no volume physical slider or anything.
[3103.18 → 3104.72] So I can't, it's just voice commands.
[3104.84 → 3106.12] I can't do it through my phone.
[3106.22 → 3113.12] It's just, so I'm just like, so it's glaringly ridiculously loud or off is like my two, but,
[3113.22 → 3119.08] but not off because it took me about 15 minutes to recognize like this weird buzzing sound that
[3119.08 → 3122.22] I could barely hear was technically music coming from the little box.
[3122.34 → 3123.50] Maybe you just need better music, loser.
[3123.50 → 3128.02] Maybe if your music wasn't so crappy, you wouldn't mind if it was loud.
[3128.02 → 3129.82] I didn't even know what it was playing at that point.
[3129.92 → 3130.38] You heard me.
[3130.42 → 3134.02] Because it just ransomed through Google Play Music and was on some random song.
[3134.14 → 3135.12] I had no idea what it was.
[3135.40 → 3136.50] People say do it by percentage.
[3138.66 → 3140.28] Set the volume to whatever.
[3140.48 → 3140.70] Okay.
[3140.80 → 3141.56] Yeah, 25%.
[3141.56 → 3142.10] All right.
[3142.20 → 3144.64] But then that even takes trial and error because I don't know what percentage it's at.
[3144.70 → 3145.26] They're helping us.
[3145.32 → 3145.90] They're helping us.
[3145.94 → 3146.10] Okay.
[3146.70 → 3147.84] That's decent though.
[3147.96 → 3148.54] That's not bad.
[3148.86 → 3149.04] Yeah.
[3149.04 → 3152.82] It should be, it should go down a reasonable amount if you tell it to turn the volume down.
[3152.82 → 3154.22] I think Tie Jester nailed it here.
[3154.56 → 3156.12] Or Luke could just not be an idiot.
[3156.96 → 3157.34] Nice.
[3157.42 → 3158.04] Thank you, Tie Jester.
[3158.06 → 3158.58] No, that's solid.
[3158.62 → 3159.20] Appreciate that.
[3159.30 → 3159.44] Yeah.
[3159.58 → 3159.74] Yeah.
[3160.16 → 3160.36] Yeah.
[3161.28 → 3162.50] Luke was, Luke was wrong.
[3162.86 → 3163.56] Luke was wrong.
[3163.70 → 3164.10] 2018.
[3164.48 → 3165.82] Oh, don't bring that website back.
[3166.48 → 3168.02] The, the statement is cool.
[3168.08 → 3169.04] The website is not cool.
[3169.20 → 3169.56] Yeah.
[3170.34 → 3170.46] Yeah.
[3170.46 → 3170.54] Yeah.
[3170.54 → 3171.78] All right.
[3172.12 → 3173.92] So I guess that's pretty much it.
[3175.56 → 3176.04] Yeah.
[3176.14 → 3177.24] Everything else here is kind of boring.
[3177.36 → 3177.52] Yeah.
[3178.46 → 3178.76] So.
[3178.96 → 3180.02] Pirates did pirate stuff.
[3180.20 → 3180.44] Yep.
[3180.62 → 3182.56] With Microsoft's UWP protection.
[3182.94 → 3183.14] Yep.
[3183.38 → 3185.98] Samsung unveiled a big SSD, but that is physically small.
[3186.28 → 3187.14] There's lots of capacity.
[3187.36 → 3187.70] Hooray.
[3188.40 → 3188.92] U-Torrent.
[3189.24 → 3190.78] There's a vulnerability that's bad.
[3190.98 → 3191.70] That's surprising.
[3192.70 → 3193.12] Lord.
[3193.20 → 3195.14] There's more augmented reality stuff out of Google.
[3195.60 → 3195.78] So.
[3195.78 → 3195.92] Yep.
[3195.92 → 3196.78] Call me in two years.
[3197.18 → 3197.42] Yep.
[3198.32 → 3198.72] Um.
[3199.16 → 3201.94] Tesla is doing a wall charger, but now for your office.
[3202.70 → 3203.14] Which is like.
[3203.32 → 3203.64] Okay.
[3205.48 → 3205.92] Okay.
[3206.70 → 3207.06] Um.
[3207.22 → 3209.24] Apparently it'll be free, but you still have to pay for electricity.
[3210.34 → 3210.78] What?
[3211.04 → 3211.34] Okay.
[3212.56 → 3220.60] Also, Asus is launching premium GTX 1050 and 1050 Ti graphics cards with 144 hour burn-in quality
[3220.60 → 3223.84] control and longer warranties aimed at land cafés.
[3225.42 → 3225.86] Okay.
[3226.02 → 3232.58] From my experience, when it comes to like cheap products, it's usually, it usually makes
[3232.58 → 3237.88] far more sense to just like to buy a new one when it bricks, because by then the new one
[3237.88 → 3240.80] will probably be better than the old one, but whatever.
[3241.52 → 3243.04] So we'll see you again next week.
[3243.14 → 3244.72] Same bad time, same bad channel.
[3247.50 → 3248.02] Bye.
[3248.60 → 3249.72] Land café is still a thing.
[3249.72 → 3251.26] In some places, very much so.
[3251.40 → 3251.60] Yeah.
[3251.68 → 3251.90] Yeah.
[3251.90 → 3255.64] Definitely still a thing, but like, I don't see why they would buy a more expensive card
[3255.64 → 3255.98] for it.
[3256.28 → 3256.86] New website.
[3256.96 → 3257.98] Lukewasanidiot.com.
[3258.60 → 3259.60] Let's do it.
[3259.60 → 3260.10] Let's do it.
[3267.10 → 3268.56] Did someone already take it?
[3269.00 → 3269.60] I don't know.
[3270.16 → 3270.72] I'm in check.
[3270.72 → 3277.90] You're already there.
[3279.54 → 3280.20] Did I spell it right?
[3280.82 → 3281.54] Wouldn't that be terrible?
[3281.70 → 3282.88] Misspelling lukewasanidiot.com.
[3282.88 → 3284.02] Oh, it's available.
[3284.24 → 3284.94] It's available.
[3285.40 → 3286.56] Lukewasanidiot.com.
[3287.38 → 3287.78] Fantastic.
[3289.18 → 3291.36] Lukewillberong2019.com.
[3293.40 → 3294.50] And we're done here.
[3294.50 → 3298.16] Thank you.
[3298.36 → 3298.82] Greyson'
