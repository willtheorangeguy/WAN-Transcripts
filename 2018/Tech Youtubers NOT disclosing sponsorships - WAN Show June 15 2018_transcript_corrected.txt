[0.00 → 9.50] how about now I mean the mic thing is bumping we'll see what people say just waiting on the
[9.50 → 22.26] chat to stop pressing f to pay respects waiting on the chat come on yeah yeah, thanks twitch chat
[22.26 → 31.62] welcome to the show uh Linus is here Linus too hi guys I'm Linus from maple ridge bc I enjoy socks
[31.62 → 38.90] sandals and badminton and annual employee reviews and apparently camping uh Linus has gone camping
[38.90 → 44.48] John's on the show this week uh, and we have a great show like every week I don't even know if
[44.48 → 49.88] we have enough topics to uh to call out in the intro thingy, but we do a bunch of tech YouTubers
[49.88 → 56.08] were accused of not disclosing computer sponsorships or being paid to go to booths and all this other
[56.08 → 61.40] kind of stuff jay from jay's two cents has already released a full video about this I know a lot of
[61.40 → 65.88] people have been talking about this on a lot of tech yeahs a number of other I'm not sure who else did
[65.88 → 72.22] like a full on video besides jay but I know that Paul and kyle and I think also some others at least
[72.22 → 76.56] addressed it on Twitter so yeah gamers nexus was talking about it is as well like a lot of people
[76.56 → 80.22] talking about it on Twitter and then I know jay made a full dedicated video outside that I'm not
[80.22 → 85.44] entirely sure uh, but we'll talk about that unsurprisingly everyone in the YouTube tech review
[85.44 → 92.08] scene is friends, so this got slammed down pretty fast with a collective effort of like what the f
[92.08 → 98.04] that's bull poop um anyway moving on we'll talk about that more later there's a rumour that an
[98.04 → 106.12] eight core version of the 8700k is coming this fall uh people are thinking that they're just kind of
[106.12 → 110.42] intel is just kind of reacting to AMD because they don't really seem to have a logical roadmap anymore
[110.42 → 115.78] but we'll, we'll talk about that later also AT&T closes the Time Warner deal is this like straight
[115.78 → 122.96] up like for sure z according um so i actually your arms look huge you're a machine I'm sorry he's
[122.96 → 127.48] off camera yeah nick is over here off camera flexing for us and trying to distract us from the show with
[127.48 → 134.10] his pythons uh but yes um I talked about this on tech link today um okay yes this deal is apparently
[134.10 → 138.92] final so wow the judge approved it like two days ago and I think they were just sort of chomping at
[138.92 → 145.54] the bit to get it done so wow okay also we've got apple uh is trying to stop developers from sharing
[145.54 → 154.64] data on users friends that sound good probably yeah I don't know um a rumour that the that there's
[154.64 → 162.12] an AMD Radeon Rx 680 which like an expected price range of like three to four hundred bucks and a
[162.12 → 168.00] rumour that Windows 10 is going to run on a Google Pixel book which is pretty weird but probably a good
[168.00 → 173.62] idea, and we're going to talk about smash brothers ultimate briefly oh maybe so yeah that's going to
[173.62 → 178.14] happen oh yeah that's actually pretty sweet okay there are no good topics today oh interesting
[178.14 → 184.62] yeah but then like things that other people care about other than me people care about this
[184.62 → 192.02] do you want it that would be pretty cool
[192.02 → 208.12] yeah oh right uh sponsors uh moss backpack savage jerky and oh Ltd oh we're sponsoring ourselves
[208.12 → 216.76] we're sponsoring ourselves it's amazing and set that back and uh here we have so much ill-gotten money
[216.76 → 220.90] according to this first topic we'll talk about that we can just sponsor ourselves yeah which I think we're
[220.90 → 225.42] going to bring nick on for so the first topic of the day is going to be the tech YouTubers accused
[225.42 → 231.44] of not getting up okay yeah yeah yeah okay I'll just like stand in the back I'll do an I'll do a slab
[231.44 → 235.74] squat in the back yeah but um well you're going to get owned by the microphone it's okay I'll
[235.74 → 240.28] figure it out yeah tech YouTubers accused of not disclosing computer sponsorships so Nick had the
[240.28 → 245.68] great idea of coming down as our businessman to directly address sure um it's pretty simple
[245.68 → 254.00] if we're paid by someone we tell you that's literally it um yes we visit sponsors booths yes we
[254.00 → 258.84] create coverage at sponsors booths um we say that right at the beginning of the video at the end of
[258.84 → 266.72] the video um we do not charge an appearance fee to show up at a booth um brands reach out to us they
[266.72 → 270.36] say we have interesting stuff, and you should check it out, and we say okay sure we might check it out
[270.36 → 277.64] and sometimes we do, and sometimes we don't and that's literally how we do it so if you are concerned
[277.64 → 281.76] that the content that you're watching is paid for um just check the beginning of the video and if it
[281.76 → 286.40] says this is sponsored by so-and-so then yes and if it doesn't say that then no, and it'll also say
[286.40 → 292.12] that in the video description so it's literally that simple for us yeah that's it
[292.12 → 298.52] cool short and to the point yeah I'm gonna I don't know it's from my perspective it's like
[298.52 → 303.82] I don't know it's its literally that simple if we're paid by someone we say it and if we don't
[303.82 → 309.74] say it then we're not paid by them to make that content that's it yeah, yeah cool and I'll add some
[309.74 → 316.30] like more kind of anecdotes, but that's that's more or less it um i I think most people in the tech
[316.30 → 321.52] review space do sort of the same deal i I can't think of anyone off the top of my head who doesn't
[321.52 → 328.32] disclose sponsorships that I've been able to notice but um like if is at a lot of the shows that I've
[328.32 → 332.34] done it's changed a little bit since I've been doing a lot of shows but a lot of the shows that
[332.34 → 339.02] I've done the majority of the videos that come out of that show are not have anything to do with the
[339.02 → 345.62] sponsorship for that show so like say corsair because they sponsored a bunch of shows that I did
[345.62 → 350.48] in the past say corsair is sponsoring it they were a sponsor at computer so we are okay that works we created
[350.48 → 356.64] 10 videos at computer one video was at the corsair suite they were a sponsor of the show we said that
[356.64 → 362.78] it was sponsored by them um the other sponsor we had was glass pass who wasn't at the show and isn't
[362.78 → 367.92] a computer manufacturer so it wouldn't be at the show so 90 of the videos were not about the sponsor
[367.92 → 373.96] at computer yeah so, so nine out of ten videos were not about corsair and oftentimes we'll have it where
[373.96 → 379.90] like I'm going to use corsair again I've done a show at pax where corsair was the sponsor and I covered
[379.90 → 386.10] like three or four competitors all positively and that was fine and everyone was okay and corsair was happy
[386.10 → 389.84] and we were happy and everyone else was happy and just my experience with this which is like
[389.84 → 394.50] obviously a lot more limited than someone like Luke but I've spent a couple of years since I've been to
[394.50 → 400.44] a show for the company with CES but um a big part of my job when I was a CES at that year was just
[400.44 → 408.46] go around and find interesting stuff um sponsorship money any none of those sorts of considerations had
[408.46 → 412.84] nothing to do with what I was doing it was just walked around take notes if something is interesting
[412.84 → 417.30] get some b-roll of it maybe we can do a video on it that was literally it there was never anything
[417.30 → 422.52] shady exchanged in the background so yeah and that's that's another important point that I didn't
[422.52 → 431.68] mention um but like we don't do anything um where someone says you can't do this all of our sponsorships
[431.68 → 437.44] are just about what we can do um we don't do like exclusivity with anyone in the computer space
[437.44 → 443.24] at all yeah yeah it'd be a bad idea for us too is tying our hands as to what we can do which makes
[443.24 → 447.30] no sense from a business perspective, so this is the thing that always makes me kind of chuckle is that
[447.30 → 451.90] people go oh you guys just want money you just want money if you think we're all about money
[451.90 → 457.92] what would be more intelligent taking some money now and potentially losing the trust of viewers
[457.92 → 462.90] or taking more money in the long term while maintaining the trust of viewers and partners
[462.90 → 468.48] like if you just think we're all about money the smart choice is for us to be honest about
[468.48 → 472.36] who we're being paid by because then we have long longevity and when you have a company of
[472.36 → 477.98] 20 odd people I don't know the exact number but somewhere around there um and Linus media group is
[477.98 → 484.06] indirectly kind of whole propping up float plane right now like that's a lot of people and literally
[484.06 → 489.50] companies to support you want a long-term solution you don't want a burst of money in a short period i
[489.50 → 495.32] think when scandals or alleged scandals like this pop up people tend to concentrate on short term like
[495.32 → 501.72] oh we have evidence of like this one deal that has this like impressive dollar amount on it maybe
[501.72 → 507.60] and that's obviously, obviously like oh we have evidence of a thing that may have happened one time
[507.60 → 512.42] you know and that I think gets eyeballs it gets clicks as opposed to what you were just talking about
[512.42 → 517.00] where oh we're trying to like make as much as we can be through like a long-term review of things
[517.00 → 521.24] and what's going to be sustainable for the long term that isn't particularly interesting to someone
[521.24 → 527.64] who wants to read about a YouTuber scandal so and like most tech YouTubers that I know of that I've
[527.64 → 532.88] watched their show coverage of do it in generally the same way uh that we do I'm not saying anyone's
[532.88 → 537.00] copying each other I'm not getting into that that doesn't matter, but it's you go to the show you
[537.00 → 541.30] do like your little right at the beginning of the video call out thank you for bringing me to the show
[541.30 → 546.76] you make a video about whatever happens to be there it'll probably include one to two videos of the
[546.76 → 553.80] company that brought you uh plus a whole ton like the last show we were at 90 of the videos were from
[553.80 → 557.78] unrelated companies and then at the end of the video you often do another call out thank you for
[557.78 → 564.18] bringing me a computer, and then you move on it's its worked the same way for like five years or
[564.18 → 572.48] something I think we're probably like on the more aggressive end of like actually doing content with
[572.48 → 577.86] sponsors like that's what made me laugh about this like list or whatever was that like gamers' nexus
[577.86 → 584.44] was included yeah, and they're like the least chilly people you could think they will destroy everyone
[584.44 → 589.46] yeah, yeah anyway I didn't want to make the whole show about this I just figured yeah I know well it
[589.46 → 594.68] was important to address because I know uh a lot of the other tech guys have been really vocal about
[594.68 → 597.68] this on Twitter and jay made the video and I don't think we've really talked about it much
[597.68 → 604.04] we don't yeah we don't typically um he's the wan show for that kind of stuff so we decided to talk
[604.04 → 610.28] about it a little bit but yeah that's what it yeah okay thanks nick so yeah if you want is you
[610.28 → 616.30] want a little bit more information on stuff you can watch jay's video um I don't remember
[616.30 → 621.88] exactly what it's titled but I think it's his second most recent video give me one second
[621.88 → 626.46] it's called the truth about how I earn money, and it's kind of cool because he goes into more stuff
[626.46 → 631.84] than just shows he runs down basically uh the like breadth of his business he talks about the
[631.84 → 637.52] merchandising line he talks about uh other deals that he's done and uh how he's trying to grow stuff
[637.52 → 642.46] like his uh personal branded merch and whatnot it's a little bit like the um the honest answer
[642.46 → 646.26] video that yeah did about how we make money, although we're not accusing jay of like copying us or anything
[646.26 → 651.60] like that it's just a good it's a good thing to do I think so yeah it was I think it was a good it was
[651.60 → 656.40] perfect timing and a good idea for jay to do his now, and we did ours a while ago yes for
[656.40 → 663.34] I believe a similar reason I don't remember or not I don't think there was one big specific
[663.34 → 668.48] specific event I think just there were a lot of fans were questioning I think there was a lot of
[668.48 → 674.08] toxicity like in the comment sections of some of our videos between like that like the intel fans
[674.08 → 680.06] the AMD fans the NVIDIA fans all going at each other and trying to say oh here's who which
[680.06 → 684.68] which company's line is favouring the NVIDIA shill thing or something like that I think yeah yeah because
[684.68 → 689.36] I remember in that video we talked about how like NVIDIA's given us almost nothing uh we just make
[689.36 → 692.88] a lot of videos about them because people like their stuff, and they're a lot of stuff they're
[692.88 → 697.72] they're huge I mean they're the biggest player in the GPU industry so we kind of uh and GPU videos do
[697.72 → 704.20] do really well um so yeah we have our honest answers thing jay has his truth about how I make money
[704.20 → 709.68] I recommend watching both of them I find them both very interesting yes even our like I knew all of
[709.68 → 716.10] ours already but even ours I think was quite good um and yeah the fact that gamers nexus was
[716.10 → 721.02] included is hilarious because they just rip holes in everything they do so like yeah like their
[721.02 → 727.48] stuff is like so technical and in-depth and like if you know is is any YouTuber is going to try to get
[727.48 → 732.72] away with that kind of thing they would be they would have the hardest road to getting away with it
[732.72 → 742.98] so why you know I don't know but anyway moving on to a rumour love them rumours uh we went from a
[742.98 → 748.22] rumour about us to a rumour about a tech company this is a wonderful show it's much less spicy though based
[748.22 → 755.42] on hardcore definite facts um so anyway there's a rumour about an eight core version of a 8700k
[755.42 → 762.54] that could be coming this fall this is uh by guru 3d, and it was posted by cachalot on the forum
[762.54 → 767.68] I'm gonna post this into the twitch chat real quick what did I just do what am I doing
[767.68 → 776.00] I wasn't holding control I see there we go um but yeah it's its people are kind of speculating that
[776.00 → 784.30] this isn't really this wasn't really planned for oh that sucks am I using the right thing uh and
[784.30 → 791.72] whether it was planned for it does seem quite reactionary uh maybe it was coming I suspect even if it
[791.72 → 796.54] was coming it was going to be coming later than it did end up coming i kind of think the truth is
[796.54 → 800.72] probably somewhere in the middle as we try to get our technical issues worked out here uh yeah
[800.72 → 806.72] I want to keep going with that yes I will okay so uh but yeah what I was going to say was um you know
[806.72 → 811.20] there's a question here in front of me does intel even have their own roadmap anymore or are they just
[811.20 → 818.40] being reactionary towards what AMD is doing it might be a little bit of both um because all oh there
[818.40 → 824.02] we go it's working now all of intel's difficulties trying to get a 10 nanometre chip to market have
[824.02 → 830.14] been very well documented right like oh when are they going to originally release 10 nanometre
[830.14 → 836.50] like a year ago two years ago something like that yeah yeah so they have to do something to keep
[836.50 → 843.20] innovating quote unquote innovating in the meantime but um you know AMD did they force intel's hand here
[843.20 → 849.92] maybe a little bit um I do think it's really ironic that we're seeing so what it's um how many years
[849.92 → 854.36] has it been since the FX series from AMD came out like seven years or so quite a while something like
[854.36 → 861.08] that so it's so it's so ironic now I think that intel is reacting and trying to compete with AMD
[861.08 → 868.32] just by strapping more cores onto a CPU because an eight core i7 is not something we've seen on the
[868.32 → 874.98] mainstream consumer end you had originally, or before you had to buy um an enthusiast platform
[874.98 → 880.78] an enthusiast motherboard to do that so uh but eight core versions apparently coming uh this fall um no
[880.78 → 885.92] pricing information on that yet but um it's interesting because you know um obviously it is
[885.92 → 890.06] going to be the most cores we've ever seen from intel on a consumer platform, but it is consumer yeah but
[890.06 → 895.30] it is kind of funny um you know seeing as the big knock on AMD for a long time was oh they're selling
[895.30 → 899.60] these six and eight core CPUs but who cares they're not really giving anyone the benefit so
[899.60 → 905.44] yeah um, but the thing was especially back then with intel having so much of the market share
[905.44 → 913.84] no one was able to develop for that reasonably so now having AMD CPUs matter a lot more uh to be
[913.84 → 919.06] completely honest and having intel have to react to that and pump out a bunch of cores yeah meaning
[919.06 → 922.88] there are a lot more cores across the field meaning it'll make a lot more sense for developers to push
[922.88 → 926.12] for it which would be really cool because I don't know if you guys remember this but I used to make
[926.12 → 932.92] cores for gaming videos and I would do like oh it's summer 2014 how many cores do you need to game with
[932.92 → 938.58] and we stopped after I made like three or four of them because we were like well you could watch
[938.58 → 943.94] any of these and get the answer because it was the same thing every single time so hopefully this
[943.94 → 948.64] will actually mix that up definitely uh we can make another course for gaming video yeah you know
[948.64 → 953.48] and obviously there's been development challenges just with how you know the stuff is actually
[953.48 → 958.56] coded to spread the work cloud out load among more cores, but you know there might be more effort
[958.56 → 962.74] put into that now that what you were saying there's just more cores out there where you have
[962.74 → 968.48] a chip with four cores eight threads, or you know six and twelve is just a more mainstream choice now so
[968.48 → 973.30] it's its you always have to have one obviously the software or the hardware has to come first
[973.30 → 978.50] usually it's easier for the industry if the hardware comes first I know with some certain
[978.50 → 982.76] games that have come out and stuff it's been like oh wow hardware really isn't ready for this yet yeah
[982.76 → 987.44] like nothing can run this yeah yeah exactly and then that's usually a fairly uncomfortable spot for
[987.44 → 993.34] the industry to be in its fun I enjoy that space, but it's fairly uncomfortable for consumers to be
[993.34 → 997.28] constantly needing to replace all their stuff to be able to do anything so having the hardware
[997.28 → 1001.28] first is good so we're going to get eight core out there and get people used to it and have developers
[1001.28 → 1008.86] start using it more often that would be pretty sweet and awesome absolutely it is a little
[1008.86 → 1014.86] bit of a kick in the pants for people who recently I know someone specifically who like just bought a
[1014.86 → 1020.38] new processor uh that being said this isn't coming until fall so it will be a little while uh but like
[1020.38 → 1028.10] the 8086 i7 8086k like just came out yeah that was, and it's pretty sweet but like that was like a nice
[1028.10 → 1033.86] little stunt for however many weeks that was yeah chip to get but then now it's like oh coming
[1033.86 → 1039.60] this fall you've got an eight core version of a 8700k so it's like it's like what if you like to spend a
[1039.60 → 1046.42] ton of money you buy a house and the house has like trim where it's um where the cabinets are a certain
[1046.42 → 1051.08] colour or certain style that was in for like literally a month yeah then everyone thinks it's
[1051.08 → 1057.22] ugly this is yeah so if you buy the expensive CPU it's a bit like that so oh man yeah I couldn't give
[1057.22 → 1062.64] two craps about cabinets but I totally understand the reference um gotta get that resale value man
[1062.64 → 1067.86] it's its great when you walk into someone's house who's been like perfectly maintained done a really
[1067.86 → 1072.38] good job of keeping their house up, but they haven't changed a single thing in it since like the mid 90s
[1072.38 → 1078.36] they have like lurid pink wallpaper with like an awesome yeah it's actually so cool i just it's its like a
[1078.36 → 1088.10] time capsule um okay and moving on to something that I know nothing about at all so good luck uh
[1088.10 → 1095.66] AT&T closes the Time Warner deal this sounds terrible to me, I don't know I don't know anything
[1095.66 → 1104.36] about it uh a federal judge ruled on Tuesday that AT&T's 85.4 billion dollar bid for Time Warner
[1104.36 → 1110.50] was legal imposing no conditions on the merger all of this despite a lawsuit from the justice
[1110.50 → 1114.84] department arguing that the deal would be anti-competitive and oh my goodness how is it not
[1114.84 → 1120.18] I don't understand I can tell you a little bit about that please give me one quick second before
[1120.18 → 1126.14] you do that sure i kind of bait and switched you there we're gonna use uh the verge.com for our
[1126.14 → 1132.08] source and thank you to Sherman tanker for posting this on the forum you're good to go okay um so
[1132.08 → 1140.04] so when I was in law school just a quick disclaimer I didn't learn a ton about antitrust if you watch
[1140.04 → 1145.20] like if you watch tech wiki and the videos we've sort of done like law and tech a lot of it has to
[1145.20 → 1149.36] do with intellectual property because I took a lot of intellectual property in law school so talking
[1149.36 → 1152.62] about copyrights and like what you can do with content online and how you can share it and that
[1152.62 → 1157.40] sort of thing um but here's why I can tell you about antitrust and just in case you don't even know
[1157.40 → 1163.64] what antitrust is um antitrust law basically concerns companies that get too big the idea of
[1163.64 → 1169.36] antitrust law is to prevent monopolies is to prevent one company dominating the marketplace for
[1169.36 → 1174.94] a certain thing you know imagine if the only company out there making monitors was LG for example
[1174.94 → 1180.96] that wouldn't be good you would have no choice in what you could buy so uh so with this um what's
[1180.96 → 1185.86] happening is AT&T which is obviously a huge telecommunications company they run you know back
[1185.86 → 1190.62] in the day that are most known for running phone networks these days are a huge ISP um they just
[1190.62 → 1198.36] bought um Time Warner which includes um some huge like media properties uh HBO CNN um Warner
[1198.36 → 1204.18] brothers basically everything Warner brothers does is owned by Time Warner so what this is called is
[1204.18 → 1208.72] called um a vertical merger and the reason it's called a vertical merger is that you have one
[1208.72 → 1215.26] company buying another company that does something different, or more specifically one company provides
[1215.26 → 1221.08] the other company with supplies, or it's a or supply chain right so um in this case Time Warner
[1221.08 → 1227.04] is providing content they're providing like I said they're um they own HBO and CNN so they're providing
[1227.04 → 1232.36] Game of Thrones or the sopranos or the wolf blitzer show or whatever people watch on CNN I don't know i
[1232.36 → 1239.52] don't watch CNN anymore but um so and you know AT&T is the ISP so um they're providing the content
[1239.52 → 1245.68] that AT&T can deliver down their pipes so that's what we mean by a vertical merger there's also a
[1245.68 → 1249.88] horizontal merger which is a little bit simpler where one company buys another company that does
[1249.88 → 1253.68] basically the same thing imagine if ups bought FedEx for example right that would be a horizontal
[1253.68 → 1259.96] merger but so when the government so is that like a vertical merger would be like you, you buy
[1259.96 → 1265.26] functionality and a horizontal merger would almost be like you buy market share yeah that's that's not a
[1265.26 → 1269.18] bad way to put roughly yeah you're buying functionality or buying supplies like to help
[1269.18 → 1274.18] you somehow you know right so um like imagine if McDonald's like have their own farms that would be
[1274.18 → 1279.46] vertical integration you know tesla has purchased a few like manufacturing companies yeah and like
[1279.46 → 1283.10] like companies that are into like tools and manufacturing and whatnot so that probably helps
[1283.10 → 1289.50] them vertically I'm not sure exactly how to classify that because I think um I think it was also
[1289.50 → 1296.58] manufacturing yeah yeah I'm not exactly sure but anyway so um so specifically talking about this
[1296.58 → 1303.86] um so the justice department of the U.S. took um ATT to court afraid that this would make ATT too big
[1303.86 → 1311.70] um there's like an antitrust concern here with just way too much market power but um legally it is um
[1311.70 → 1315.64] and I was actually looking at the judge's decision which is like 200 pages long and full of legalese
[1315.64 → 1321.92] obviously earlier but one key thing he mentioned was that in a horizontal merger courts usually have
[1321.92 → 1325.80] a little bit easier time deciding you can just say oh you're buying another company that does
[1325.80 → 1329.70] something similar so let's just look at how much market share you'll have now and if it's too much
[1329.70 → 1334.64] market share we'll just say you can't do this it's easy a vertical merger is a lot more difficult
[1334.64 → 1339.98] because you're buying a company that does something else so these sorts of cases they tend to be very
[1339.98 → 1345.48] fact intensive there is very case-by-case basis and just based on that alone the government
[1345.48 → 1351.24] immediately already had a tougher time proving its case to go in front of a judge and saying
[1351.24 → 1357.18] and say hey ATT buying Time Warner is going to be really bad for consumers um it wasn't good enough
[1357.18 → 1362.74] for to get the court to buy it and the judge said get out, and they let ATT do the merger and that's
[1362.74 → 1369.16] kind of it so people are saying this in twitch chat and i I there's one guy that just says bored
[1369.16 → 1379.34] other than that dude that happens uh on every story we talk about though um I've someone said
[1379.34 → 1384.24] this in twitch chat and I've read this before online in some in the 80s or something they broke up AT&T
[1384.24 → 1390.22] because it's too big yeah um, and now they're letting them merge and become bigger the idea back
[1390.22 → 1395.78] then and obviously you and I were both well what year were you born I was not alive okay Luke didn't
[1395.78 → 1402.06] exist and I was like tiny in the 80s I was born in 87 but um back in the 80s before like everyone had
[1402.06 → 1410.12] the internet um AT&T ran a bunch of they provided um don't completely quote me on this but I think what
[1410.12 → 1418.20] happened is they had both long distance and local um telephone service, and they just controlled so much
[1418.20 → 1422.12] of the telephone market I know they were a huge deal in telephone back in the day yeah they could
[1422.12 → 1426.28] just control so much the telephone market and what ended up happening is the U.S. government broke
[1426.28 → 1431.98] up their local operations into they call them the baby bells and these were companies that were
[1431.98 → 1436.76] spun off as independent, but they served like different chunks geographical chunks of the U.S.
[1436.76 → 1441.76] but that's a little bit different because we're talking about the same things phone service this is a
[1441.76 → 1447.94] little bit different because you have an ISP buying the folks who own HBO right so it's a little bit
[1447.94 → 1454.26] different AT&T was divested in 1983 by the United States government it had natural monopoly over the
[1454.26 → 1458.38] telecommunication lines such as telegraph and telephone, and they were the only group basically
[1458.38 → 1462.62] that's right so yeah so that's quite a bit different from it is now the baby bells were
[1462.62 → 1469.06] stripped up into pieces like bell south Atlantic bell etc they slowly consolidated back into companies
[1469.06 → 1474.04] like AT&T Verizon yeah that's right when I was a kid our local phone provider was bell
[1474.04 → 1480.82] south, and they were one of the exact companies so interesting okay all right well moving on from
[1480.82 → 1485.74] that just in case you're hashtag bored yeah and like that dude in chat was it was hilarious because
[1485.74 → 1492.52] this happens right as the net neutrality repeal yeah it was a thing so yeah, so hopefully there won't
[1492.52 → 1496.16] be fast lanes for Game of Thrones but I guess if you're a Game of Thrones fanatic you'll be happy about
[1496.16 → 1502.74] that but the most pirated show let's see how that goes for them um apple tries to stop developers
[1502.74 → 1508.62] from sharing use uh data on their users friends this immediately sounds like a good thing to me
[1508.62 → 1514.02] but I don't really know yet uh it's posted by anover5 on the forum and the source we're going to
[1514.02 → 1519.44] use is bloomberg.com how do you feel so pro when we use Bloomberg as a source like because you turn
[1519.44 → 1524.60] on Bloomberg TV there's always financial stuff going on I didn't even know Bloomberg TV was a thing
[1524.60 → 1531.74] just seems very pro you know anyway it has a cool name okay um Apple Inc changed its app store rules
[1531.74 → 1536.60] last week to limit how developers use information about iPhone owners friends and other contacts
[1536.60 → 1541.26] quietly closing a loophole that let app makers store and share data without many people's consent
[1541.26 → 1548.78] yay good thing thank you apple for closing a said loophole I think that's kind of the gist of it I'm
[1548.78 → 1552.72] going to get this uh nice lady off the screen because I don't know what she's actually talking about
[1552.72 → 1560.12] and we're going to go back to here um but yeah apparently many developers ask users for access
[1560.12 → 1566.12] to their phone's contacts only use it for marketing or sometimes um or sometimes share and sell the
[1566.12 → 1571.36] information all without permission from the people listed in those digital address books that's the
[1571.36 → 1579.30] problem is that your phone your address book those people's information other companies running apps
[1579.30 → 1585.46] are able to take that and sell it um whereas that's supposed to maybe only be used for like
[1585.46 → 1591.46] sharing things or seeing if you have other friends that are online you know how some games you can like
[1591.46 → 1596.14] import your address book and then see if your friends are online well they might sell that and that's bad
[1596.14 → 1601.14] I feel like this is a GDPR thing, or it might be like they may have done this in response to GDPR
[1601.14 → 1606.42] like I don't have that's just me speculating, but it seems like the timing seems like that might be why
[1606.42 → 1615.34] well I think because this sounds like something that will be absolutely not allowed by the GDPR
[1615.34 → 1622.08] yeah where your data is getting used, and you have no idea what's going on with it, I just think in this
[1622.08 → 1628.56] case both companies might be a fault yes uh so I think apple's trying to close their end, but this is
[1628.56 → 1632.72] also a problem for app developers they would both be in trouble or that law of apple for not like
[1632.72 → 1637.52] securing the data and passing it on and then the app developers for using it without permission so
[1637.52 → 1642.02] apple's probably just taking care of that definitely needs to be taken care of um the new app store
[1642.02 → 1649.22] review guidelines bar developers uh sorry the new app store review guidelines bar developers from
[1649.22 → 1655.30] making databases of address book information they gather from iPhone users sharing and selling that
[1655.30 → 1659.62] database with third parties is now forbidden probably should have been already but whatever
[1659.62 → 1664.90] an app can't get a user's contact list say it's being used for one thing and then use it again for
[1664.90 → 1670.54] something else unless the developer gets consent again obviously this can still be abused but I think it's a
[1670.54 → 1675.80] vector for apple to rip you off the app store so if they catch you doing this you'll get you'll get
[1675.80 → 1680.94] tossed right um anyone yeah anyone caught breaking the rules may be banned this sounds like an extremely
[1680.94 → 1687.44] easy rule to break and probably not that hard of a rule to get away with breaking um but at least
[1687.44 → 1692.20] they have it written out now that they can give you the boot if you do break it uh when users like
[1692.20 → 1696.92] like honestly it yeah no it does this whole thing remind me the reason I'm laughing a little bit is
[1696.92 → 1702.92] of in android p I think they took away the ability for apps to use your camera microphone in the background
[1702.92 → 1708.34] which was cool but I was like what were they doing before yeah like what were they listening to me like
[1708.34 → 1714.92] all the time before android p i so I don't uh yeah uh when users install apps and then consent
[1714.92 → 1720.34] developers get dozens of potential data points on people's friends contact lists and contain phone
[1720.34 → 1725.12] numbers email addresses profile photos and tons of other stuff as you probably know so that database
[1725.12 → 1730.08] of information is probably quite valuable um so now what they'll probably have to do is sell it to
[1730.08 → 1735.26] themselves as another company and then anonymize the data and sell it that way so it'll add one more loop
[1735.26 → 1739.80] that they have to jump through for apple to not be able to catch them so all right at least apple
[1739.80 → 1745.78] is clean to their hands uh, but this will still remain an issue um just in case anyone was wondering
[1745.78 → 1751.94] moving on i just sort of assume that everyone on the internet just knows everything about me
[1751.94 → 1760.62] yeah easier way to live yeah yeah another rumour because this show again is only about things that are
[1760.62 → 1769.40] confirmed 100 true uh rumour AMD Radeon Rx 680 the Radeon RX 680 will reportedly be powered by the Nazi GPU
[1769.40 → 1779.04] architecture um and will feature eight gigabytes of gddr6 with the performance of the GTX 1080 or GTX 1080
[1779.04 → 1785.42] or so an expected price range of 300 to 400 bucks that's actually perfect because looking at the
[1785.42 → 1791.04] stories about what NVIDIA is going to be allegedly because like you said this these are all 100%
[1791.04 → 1796.08] confirmed facts on the show of this show but um yeah but anyway um seriously there was um everyone
[1796.08 → 1803.06] saying or a lot of people are saying July 30th for um the um what's the code name for the next um not
[1803.06 → 1808.40] Volta, but it's um oh twitch chat is probably screaming at me with it right now I was writing about this
[1808.40 → 1815.66] earlier today and I've already forgotten it NVIDIA roadmap what is your thing called
[1815.66 → 1824.40] nope that's old just search that's hold on I'll get it here hold on
[1825.86 → 1832.22] twitch chat is streaming at me right now I'm sure touring touring like oh yeah
[1832.22 → 1838.16] touring or ampere so here was the one I had in my head so um they're supposed to be releasing snorkel
[1838.16 → 1843.86] they're supposed to be releasing touring at the end of July, but it's just going to be the higher
[1843.86 → 1849.94] end silicon to begin with as is tradition you know yeah so and the rumour is that the high end
[1849.94 → 1854.92] card will cost between a thousand and fifteen hundred depending on how much VRAM you get with it
[1854.92 → 1859.56] so something like this could be really appealing if you could say oh well I don't have a thousand
[1859.56 → 1866.54] dollars but I can spend 350 bucks on something with 1080 like performance so yeah uh someone in chat said
[1866.54 → 1868.24] please please make this
[1868.24 → 1877.94] square bracket anecdote poppy for mining and great for gaming um I doubt it
[1877.94 → 1887.34] eight gigs of gdr6 should probably be pretty smoking for mining um well I mean i I don't I don't know if
[1887.34 → 1892.94] you can, you know really make a card like that you know what I mean because uh memory is super
[1892.94 → 1897.18] important for mining oh no I know, but my point is just more like if he's worried about price
[1897.18 → 1901.54] this looks like it will be affordable because obviously there's this huge artificial inflation
[1901.54 → 1905.86] with the pricing um we'll have to see like immediately after this card comes out a bunch
[1905.86 → 1910.36] of miners going to get their hands on of it on of it a bunch of miners will get their hands on it
[1910.36 → 1914.58] we're both I feel like we're both slow today it's been like a long week yeah it has been a long week
[1914.58 → 1921.22] um so we'll see how it goes but looking at its price point looking at its performance this
[1921.22 → 1926.70] could be a big card for mining, but mining isn't all super hype right now yeah uh so maybe it'll be
[1926.70 → 1930.10] okay you know things change quickly yeah like a couple of months ago was a completely different story
[1930.10 → 1936.14] and also this is an interesting side note Andy will release a Nazi 20 on 7 nanometers as a high-end
[1936.14 → 1943.44] GPU in the 2020 to 2021 time frame oh boy so 7 nanometre GPU from AMD so keep your eyes out for that
[1943.44 → 1950.00] they're smashing it man it's cool I'm happy for them speaking of happy savage jerky
[1950.00 → 1956.32] I have a new favourite it's mojo jalapeño that's habanero my friend oh no that was habanero
[1956.32 → 1960.40] sorry no that the other one did we have another thing over there that says habanero I'm very sorry
[1960.40 → 1966.06] it is mojo jalapeño I can't I was like holy cow I'm slow today no I'm slow today look at me
[1966.06 → 1971.38] anyway screwing up the sponsor this is my new favourite one I haven't had it before mojo is my like
[1971.38 → 1978.84] was my like my main squeeze before uh but now I've got some mojo jalapeño in my life and i I like
[1978.84 → 1983.90] it very much is there any one of these you like would you want one absolutely oh my goodness sriracha
[1983.90 → 1990.50] bacon done this is a new pack there you go oh my goodness perfect sriracha bacon in case
[1990.50 → 1997.00] I prefer their straight up you want beef jerky they're both perfect they are perfect
[1997.00 → 2001.92] they're both very, very good I've to be fair anyone who has the like bacon flavours I prefer the beef
[2001.92 → 2007.08] jerky ones oh okay so it's its not a preference yeah yeah yeah it's its not an uh savage jerky so
[2007.08 → 2013.38] whether so whether you like dead pig or dead cow savage jerky will have something for you got you
[2013.38 → 2022.48] covered especially if you want some jalapeño um you guys know these guys as of now like the least
[2022.48 → 2027.92] surprising sponsor spot ever yeah I mean savage jerky is to the wan show as fresh books is to tech
[2027.92 → 2036.36] wiki by this point pretty much um sorry that's a good thing their jerky is made with great ingredients
[2036.36 → 2043.10] no nitrates no preservatives uh they've got 13 different types of jerky 13 different
[2043.10 → 2047.96] flavours of jerky I should say people seem to love the sriracha bacon I'm super not surprised
[2047.96 → 2054.22] that john grabbed that one Mabel buffalo bacon is also super popular they also make barbecue sauce
[2054.22 → 2060.80] hot sauce and spice rubs uh they also have Carolina reaper hot sauce which is the world's hottest pepper
[2060.80 → 2064.82] yes it's not the world's hottest hot sauce so you can actually like to eat it, and it's fine
[2064.82 → 2070.36] but it is made with the world's hottest pepper which is pretty insane they've even got an awesome
[2070.36 → 2076.74] savage jerky gift tool bag that's really cool yeah uh which includes four packs of jerky hot sauce
[2076.74 → 2082.30] herb blend or spice rub, and it makes an awesome gift I've never seen they bring up a picture of it
[2082.30 → 2090.58] yeah give me a sec savage jerky tool bag it's pronouncing the h in herb a Canadian thing a lot
[2090.58 → 2096.28] of Americans just British thing I think Canadians flip it back and forth interesting because herb and
[2096.28 → 2101.14] herb both sound perfectly fine to me there I go because Canadians are weird the more you know
[2101.14 → 2103.44] here it is what the heck
[2103.44 → 2116.00] that's a bit you get a husky tool bag a straight-up husky tool bag is included okay I was expecting
[2116.00 → 2121.32] that was going to be like kind of fake part of it, but it is not um you get four bags of jerky one
[2121.32 → 2130.46] bottle of hot sauce one bottle of uh herb blend or spice rub uh one savage jerky uh choose
[2130.46 → 2137.66] I've screwed that up before I think I called it a kazoo oh, but it's a choose that's great uh and
[2137.66 → 2143.94] two savage jerky stickers that's actually pretty cool and this isn't in my notes but I always warn
[2143.94 → 2149.42] people when there's certain special dates coming up on my twitter but I'll do a wan show warning here
[2149.42 → 2155.00] it's Father's Day on Sunday so if you need something, and they can get it to you fast enough
[2155.00 → 2162.16] I don't know what their shipping speed is, but this might be a decent idea um jumping back to
[2162.16 → 2169.84] other sponsors let's do right and sorry savage jerky but the link over here savage jerky.com
[2169.84 → 2175.96] use offer code lots save 10 uh so you can save money on the tool bag if you want to get that
[2175.96 → 2181.64] or you can just buy some bacon and save money on it saving money on bacon is always a good
[2181.64 → 2188.22] thing and moving on we have moss backpacks I love these bags and I do the same thing every time
[2188.22 → 2194.38] because it just makes me super happy but all of their bags have this really bright orange inside
[2194.38 → 2200.38] and it's lovely how well it shows up on camera too because it's just awesome, and it really proves my
[2200.38 → 2207.80] point it's extremely easy to find stuff in here let's let's grab mojo jalapeño it even has orange
[2207.80 → 2212.40] on if it's still going to be super easy to find cross branding look it's right there look how easy
[2212.40 → 2217.32] that it is a black package in a bag that's often really, really hard to find because most people make
[2217.32 → 2222.14] their bags with uh with black insides it's like a small touch it makes a big difference you know it
[2222.14 → 2228.22] really do i i i I have a backpack that has an orange inside and I will never ever go back
[2228.22 → 2235.54] it also has the like the air porter zippers so you can lay your bag out like that really easy
[2235.54 → 2241.88] so you can get through everything super wide open uh it's got nice little like mesh things you have a
[2241.88 → 2247.40] bottle in there or some cards or whatever it has a little card that explains how you can use it if you
[2247.40 → 2253.36] don't want to listen to me um and I like this too you guys aren't going to be able to see this very
[2253.36 → 2258.20] well but in the thin top zipper you know how a lot of bags will have like the small zipper
[2258.20 → 2266.00] at the top this one right here if you open that up the pocket inside is like a reinforced area it's
[2266.00 → 2273.48] not I don't think it's plastic or anything, and it's covered in like a felt like material i probably
[2273.48 → 2277.54] called it wrong I'm not very good at identifying materials, but it's a very soft type of material
[2277.54 → 2283.58] that's on top of some formed cup like shape so if you put something in there that's relatively fragile
[2283.58 → 2289.54] and you have big stuff in here that wax into it is'll be okay because the cup thing is going to
[2289.54 → 2293.70] keep its shape and project protect whatever you put inside that's actually kind of cool that's a
[2293.70 → 2299.20] good idea I haven't really seen that in a lot of bags before we're showing off their other one as well
[2299.20 → 2305.40] if you want this is the black pack if you want a different type of bag um one thing that i really
[2305.40 → 2311.84] like about these guys too is they'll have uh on different bags they'll have um this guy can I pull
[2311.84 → 2318.32] this out aha it's a wall plug why do you need a wall plug for your backpack well it's and it nicely
[2318.32 → 2322.26] tucks on the side of the bag as well so you don't even have to open up your bag to get access well you
[2322.26 → 2326.66] don't have to open up the main compartments of your bag to get access to it that wall plug is for this
[2326.66 → 2332.90] this has a standard plug so you plug your laptop or something into it is has two USB ports one of them
[2332.90 → 2336.48] is already plugged in because the cable feeds through to the front of the case, but you could
[2336.48 → 2340.86] unplug it put whatever you want in there the cable that comes with it is actually nice reinforced
[2340.86 → 2346.92] with a spring so that the cable isn't going to like get damaged in your bag which makes sense because
[2346.92 → 2350.92] it's going to stay in your bag um I don't know I think that's wonderful because you could just get
[2350.92 → 2355.90] home plug your bag into the wall, and it automatically charges everything that's in it just waiting around
[2355.90 → 2362.02] at the airport you just want to charge all your stuff at once boom done someone yes someone tweeted me
[2362.02 → 2369.04] after the last moss backpack sponsorship um talking about like oh that's just expecting trouble because
[2369.04 → 2373.08] someone's going to plug it into the wall and walk away from it, and it's going to get determined as a bomb
[2373.08 → 2379.90] just don't walk away from your don't walk away from it like uh most of the plugs in airports that
[2379.90 → 2385.22] people designing these airports generally know that people want to charge their stuff so most of the
[2385.22 → 2391.06] plugs are near seats have a sit do whatever you need to do if you want to go get some food or go to the
[2391.06 → 2395.94] washroom unplug take your backpack with you like you normally would so that people don't think it's
[2395.94 → 2400.62] a bomb in an airport that's like they say over the loudspeakers the whole time do not leave
[2400.62 → 2405.94] luggage unattended it is still luggage despite having a plug that was what I was going to say like I'm
[2405.94 → 2410.58] pretty sure they would treat it an unattended bag as suspicious even if there weren't a cable sticking
[2410.58 → 2415.44] out of it yeah like it doesn't matter so yeah, yeah so that has nothing to do with anything
[2415.44 → 2420.62] great backpacks I love the plug feature I love the orange I love the cup thing that they're doing
[2420.62 → 2428.80] uh but yeah uh check it out at the link below if you are on uh YouTube or just check them out on
[2428.80 → 2435.70] kickstarter if you look moss backpacks on kickstarter interesting um and should be good to go
[2435.70 → 2439.22] I think they're doing another campaign because these guys definitely have had laptops out before
[2439.22 → 2445.60] i I personally know someone who has bought them off of their website so I'm assuming it's an it's a
[2445.60 → 2451.98] new thingy they're doing on kickstarter uh sounds like it, I'm assuming that's the black pack that
[2451.98 → 2458.94] they're Kickstarter anyway beyond there we have ltx expo if you want to come visit the team
[2458.94 → 2465.34] meet the team meet me even though I'm not on the team oh that makes sense um come to Ltd it's a meetup
[2465.34 → 2470.88] an interactive tech event the interactive part here is important I feel like it always takes away
[2470.88 → 2475.82] I feel like we need to get like testimonials from people that go next time so we can play them
[2475.82 → 2481.88] it isn't just an event about passive absorption yeah I feel like it takes a little bit away from
[2481.88 → 2486.34] it because it's an event we're holding and I'm the one talking about it but Ltd is legitimately one
[2486.34 → 2491.10] of the coolest events I've been to I've only been to one because there's only been one uh but the
[2491.10 → 2495.18] interactive part is super cool because you go to these conventions and when I went to
[2495.18 → 2498.32] conventions when I was younger they were a little bit more grungy a little bit less planned out
[2498.32 → 2505.20] and there was a little bit more uh hand-on action because like I remember packs when I first went
[2505.20 → 2511.36] there they'd just be hacking prizes out of the booths there'd be more hands-on stuff because uh
[2511.36 → 2514.94] it was a smaller con it was a smaller con they weren't as worried about things then they started
[2514.94 → 2519.72] getting in trouble for different stuff, and they had to close it down we are keeping that in mind we
[2519.72 → 2524.00] don't want to get in trouble for stuff, but we're keeping all the booths interactive so like one of the
[2524.00 → 2528.44] really cool things that's coming this year is how to do Delia your CPU so you can bring a CPU and
[2528.44 → 2534.74] you'll have professional people showing you how to Delia it in person where else can you get that
[2534.74 → 2541.18] I literally think nowhere um really cool um every single booth is going to have some type of
[2541.18 → 2547.68] interactive uh setup with it current booths include a blind cable management competition brought to you
[2547.68 → 2551.82] by cable mod a deciding workshop so you can bring your CPUs, and we'll show you how to Delia it
[2551.82 → 2558.36] case toss 2.0 hopefully you'll do better than I did multi-headed VR a 20 pc land brought to you by
[2558.36 → 2566.24] burrower the 12k ultra-wide gaming setup and tons more I guarantee there will be tons more uh
[2566.24 → 2569.14] there is already tons more I don't know why it's not listed here probably just because it'd be way
[2569.14 → 2574.90] too much to say there's also going to be food music cool systems to look at more room more swag
[2574.90 → 2580.12] and more special guests than last year there will be exclusive live unboxing just like last year
[2580.12 → 2585.06] and more you can come hang out with us the tickets start at 35 Canadian, and you can check them out
[2585.06 → 2591.04] through the link below or because you're watching on twitch right now uh get or unless you're watching
[2591.04 → 2598.66] this later that's I said right now and that's relative so if you're watching it at 5 49 uh pacific time
[2598.66 → 2609.04] uh yeah on Friday then the link is just Ltd expo.com but if not link below its only 26 50
[2609.04 → 2615.94] USD for our American viewers it's nothing yeah it's not it's not that expensive, and it's a really fun
[2615.94 → 2620.26] convention I want people to go I want people to go because I want to keep doing it because it's
[2620.26 → 2625.58] it's literally last year's was more fun for me than last year's pax was and I've been going to pax
[2625.58 → 2631.04] since I was yeah the last year's Ltd was very enjoyable I agree 100 with that even like as an
[2631.04 → 2636.74] attendee I'm going to be 100 honest here I didn't invite most of my like personal friends to Ltd last
[2636.74 → 2640.98] year yeah because I was like it's probably just going to be a fan meetup there's going to be a few
[2640.98 → 2644.28] things to do, but it's probably mostly going to be a fan meetup and then I was like holy crap I feel
[2644.28 → 2648.72] pretty bad because it was really fun and none of the none of them came so I didn't invite them so
[2648.72 → 2656.22] wrecked uh, but they're invited this year because it'll be good uh moving back to normal news whoop
[2656.22 → 2662.66] wrong screen i have to stop beating that savage jerky man it's so good nope keep going who cares okay
[2662.66 → 2669.64] uh it's your bag as far as I'm concerned that's true you don't have to stop uh let's move on
[2670.46 → 2678.56] new iOS security feature has already been bypassed oh boy uh this was posted by captain to fire
[2678.56 → 2686.16] on the forum and our source is the forum uh but yeah iOS 12 introduces a new USB restricted mode
[2686.16 → 2691.48] that makes it harder for law enforcement agencies to thwart iPhone security USB restricted mode
[2691.48 → 2698.14] requires that an iPhone be unlocked with a passable with a passcode when connected to a computer via USB
[2698.14 → 2704.10] if the device has not already been unlocked in the last hour wow meaning phone hacking and forensic
[2704.10 → 2710.34] tools shouldn't be able to unlock phones in an email obtained by vice a forensic expert claims
[2710.34 → 2716.76] that gray shift has already defeated apple's new USB restricted mode in a beta build USB restricted
[2716.76 → 2722.50] mode is currently in beta testing and will launch to the public soon according to apple is this big like
[2722.50 → 2728.98] cat and mouse game between apple and the government yeah and this is just the latest chapter of that
[2728.98 → 2735.12] there was some um and there was some district attorney down in Louisiana who was saying that
[2735.12 → 2741.18] apple was literally promoting criminal activity by doing this and I'm just sitting here like if you
[2741.18 → 2746.92] want people to take you seriously and be on your side maybe don't say things like that but regardless
[2746.92 → 2753.58] of how you feel about it um this the fact that it's already been defeated is a little bit humorous to me
[2753.58 → 2759.66] just because like I said there's this constant arms race between its just like apple and these um
[2759.66 → 2763.58] these law enforcement folks who because the FBI has been lobbying for years and years to
[2763.58 → 2768.72] try to force apple to have a back door into their products if they want to do an investigation so
[2768.72 → 2775.38] yeah I think um it could have something to do with the beta ness of the build because they
[2775.38 → 2783.28] beat it on the beta possibly um, and we have had security firms lie about beating apple's
[2783.28 → 2787.84] security before eventually they've kind of figured it out, but they've they've lied in the early term
[2787.84 → 2793.04] what do we know about gray shift who knows off the top of my head not a ton I've heard of them before
[2793.04 → 2796.24] um gray shifts
[2796.24 → 2806.08] uh they sell phone unlocking services gray shift iPhone unlocked
[2806.08 → 2814.20] mysterious 15 000 gray key promises to unlock iPhone x for whatever yeah they're they're a phone
[2814.20 → 2820.60] unlocking thing I've heard of them before I just wasn't sure to be fair if it's that I'm starting
[2820.60 → 2827.24] to remember a little bit more about them now if it's them they probably did it oh um so wrecked I guess
[2827.24 → 2834.30] um yeah oh well we'll see if it holds through with the beta but even if it doesn't when you've got
[2834.30 → 2839.48] groups like gray shift constantly consistently going after your stuff and making a profit on it
[2839.48 → 2845.64] in a government sanctioned way you're probably boned yeah you because you have an incentive
[2845.64 → 2852.30] essentially everything's hackable right so like at some point yeah that sucks um Microsoft to help
[2852.30 → 2858.56] Walmart get rid of cashiers oh my uh Microsoft is reportedly working on this was posted by no one
[2858.56 → 2865.76] maybe uh, but our source is arstechnica.com Microsoft is reportedly working on technology that removes
[2865.76 → 2870.88] the need for cashiers and checkout lines and stores similar to Amazon's technology already implemented in
[2870.88 → 2876.14] its Amazon Go brick and mortar store uh so Microsoft is essentially doing the same thing as them
[2876.14 → 2881.10] the exact technology isn't explained, but it may be linked to the company's new
[2881.10 → 2888.16] connect uh for azure project this project builds on connects current abilities and can be used
[2888.16 → 2894.04] to execute spatial mapping and motion tracking while it's unclear how far along Microsoft is in
[2894.04 → 2898.92] developing this technology the company has reportedly shown sample tech to potential partners and has even
[2898.92 → 2905.64] talked to Walmart about implementing it directly Amazon is expected to open new go locations in Chicago
[2905.64 → 2911.08] and San Francisco soon Microsoft is making interesting moves this is a big deal
[2911.08 → 2917.56] to me because okay so Amazon Go they're putting the technology they have one store in
[2917.56 → 2923.24] Seattle they're playing two more okays, and they're going to put in whole foods right I mean they're I mean
[2923.24 → 2929.12] they're not as big as Walmart, but they're a big chain this to me is like Microsoft saying okay well I'll
[2929.12 → 2936.00] see your little dinky operation at whole foods and I'll raise you Walmart you know so we're talking about
[2936.00 → 2943.32] like the biggest retailer in the U.S. and Microsoft is trying to just it looks almost like Amazon's
[2943.32 → 2949.98] trying to like own the full stack essentially like they want the store they want the technology in
[2949.98 → 2954.94] the store they want everything and Microsoft is like no we don't need everything we just want to
[2954.94 → 2959.16] have this we'll see if they can do it because I think the challenge here is that Microsoft sort of
[2959.16 → 2964.76] cloud processing capability it's not quite as big as Amazon's is with AWS so we'll see how that
[2964.76 → 2971.46] works out for them yeah um that's quite interesting well we'll see though because Microsoft buying GitHub
[2971.46 → 2979.88] and making this move right now is probably what the kind of stuff that they need to do I don't know if
[2979.88 → 2984.78] it's best for consumer interest but if I'm just thinking about this from a Microsoft point of view
[2984.78 → 2989.38] this is the kind of stuff that they need to do they were early with the whole windows' thing
[2989.38 → 2994.64] they were early and on the ball with technology back then they tried for quite a while with
[2994.64 → 2999.48] different hardware stuff obviously Xbox was quite successful but outside that Windows phone
[2999.48 → 3005.48] June etc okay June was amazing well the product may have been good, but it just didn't catch on the
[3005.48 → 3010.56] marketplace or two different things so June music software was sweet and the June itself was
[3010.56 → 3015.64] amazing it just didn't it didn't they were just late to the party they were just late to the party
[3015.64 → 3021.06] because by the time June like was like really you know people started reviewing it positively like oh
[3021.06 → 3029.30] iPod was already a thing so yeah yeah but yeah I wish I do really wish um that June kind of took off
[3029.30 → 3034.76] but it didn't so I feel like everyone is pivoting their business a little bit these days like it feels
[3034.76 → 3038.86] like every large firm is doing it to some degree so it makes sense because a lot of the guys have been
[3038.86 → 3044.54] doing the same thing for a long time speaking of Microsoft steam is dropping Windows XP and vista
[3044.54 → 3052.68] support in 2019 uh this was posted by sc2 Mitch on the forum again we always have one from him uh it's
[3052.68 → 3058.70] they're starting on January 1st 2019 steam will officially stop supporting the Windows XP and
[3058.70 → 3064.50] Windows vista operating systems to pay respects this means that after that date the steam client will no
[3064.50 → 3071.30] longer run on those versions of windows I suspect it's just not getting updates
[3071.30 → 3077.78] they could lock out access to the steam they could because it's essentially a browser I don't know if
[3077.78 → 3083.92] they're going to, but they could so the newest features in steam rely on an embedded version of
[3083.92 → 3088.56] Google Chrome which no longer functions on older versions of windows yeah so I don't think you'll get
[3088.56 → 3094.32] updates for the remainder of 2018 steam will continue to run and launch on Windows XP and Windows vista but
[3094.32 → 3101.44] other functionality in steam will be somewhat limited uh new features such as the steam chat will not be available
[3101.44 → 3110.40] I don't know if people running those systems will care so we'll see Gmail uh can remind you to reply
[3110.40 → 3116.58] that's actually super cool as part of its new design Gmail has started resurfacing old unanswered emails with a
[3116.58 → 3122.48] suggestion that you should reply by bumping the email uh thread to the top of your inbox Gmail also breaks the
[3122.48 → 3128.64] chronological order of your inbox which is kind of poo, but you can probably disable this Gmail lets you disable all
[3128.64 → 3135.22] smart features there we go the very next note uh some users don't want smart categories important emails first and
[3135.22 → 3143.68] smart reply suggestions uh you can tick off the boxes suggest emails to reply to and suggest emails to follow up on if you
[3143.68 → 3148.86] don't want to see this orange text ever again I do want to see it personally so I'm going to leave that
[3148.86 → 3155.04] there this is me spitballing um I'm but I'm guessing they probably integrated like the um the priority
[3155.04 → 3160.90] feature you know like where it marks certain things so they use important because yeah because
[3160.90 → 3167.48] you would hate you would hate you know for it to tell you to reply to an email hey walmart.com say
[3167.48 → 3172.70] sale you know save 50 on paper towels you know, and you wouldn't want to get nags to reply to that but
[3172.70 → 3179.40] yeah, so someone in chat said steam did a hardware survey a while back they probably saw it wasn't
[3179.40 → 3185.66] worthwhile to continue support yeah I recently checked it out because i was uh having a bad day and i
[3185.66 → 3193.06] was really frustrated with the fact that my uh stream deck from legato didn't work on Windows 8.1 and it
[3193.06 → 3197.82] would like it hurts my brain that that doesn't work, and it's so confusing because it's actually a pretty
[3197.82 → 3205.76] sweet piece of tech um and like alternatives that actually do all the same things uh are way more
[3205.76 → 3212.60] expensive in most cases and alternatives that do almost the same thing well they don't they don't do
[3212.60 → 3218.52] quite the same thing as they'll do um yeah, and it's not even that I need it I don't I could just use
[3218.52 → 3223.82] a midi controller but I like it's cool it's nice and small the buttons are all framed you can change
[3223.82 → 3227.98] what it shows on the screen it's a really cool device, and it only works on Windows 10 doesn't make
[3227.98 → 3235.62] any freaking sense to me and what drove me nuts was because people have hacked it and forced it to
[3235.62 → 3241.48] work on other operating systems by checking by just all they did in the one case was they took out the
[3241.48 → 3249.50] check that checks if you're on Windows 10, and it just works it doesn't work any more they updated
[3249.50 → 3253.64] it, and now it doesn't work, but it did for a little while and I can't find what's the rationale to stop
[3253.64 → 3262.08] it from working on Windows 8.1 i I haven't got what I think of as a satisfactory answer um I'm sure
[3262.08 → 3266.30] there's something what they've been saying is it's just too much to support but what drove me nuts about
[3266.30 → 3271.96] that was that just taking the flag out made it work but then technically they have updated it since
[3271.96 → 3277.16] then, and it doesn't work anymore I doubt they forced that guy's hack to not work so they probably
[3277.16 → 3282.46] just used something that doesn't work on previous versions of windows, and now it doesn't work it's
[3282.46 → 3288.98] just the thing that drives me nuts is I looked into the steam hardware survey and all the people not
[3288.98 → 3296.38] using Windows 10 is a pretty huge market share and I can't imagine that it wouldn't be worth the dev work
[3296.38 → 3303.18] to have that available market share now something that they may have done in terms of market research
[3303.18 → 3309.26] is looking at well the people that aren't using Windows 10 are they willing to buy it maybe they're
[3309.26 → 3314.68] not using Windows 10 because they don't have the money to have a newer computer that's possible
[3314.68 → 3321.34] I don't see the merit in that, but that could be what legato's seeing i I wonder if it has to do
[3321.34 → 3327.38] anything with just some sort of CYA kind of security thing where they're just saying oh well it's an
[3327.38 → 3332.52] older version of windows it's just kind of less secure by default, and we don't want to be blamed
[3332.52 → 3337.22] if something goes wrong with our product because they're running like an old version of windows it
[3337.22 → 3342.80] could be as simple as that so who knows yeah um someone said it was free to upgrade yeah but some
[3342.80 → 3351.72] people with like I'm talking yeah some people no that's a good point I don't know I don't know what
[3351.72 → 3359.00] their reasoning is uh i i I can't understand it doesn't make any sense to me but anyway I was looking
[3359.00 → 3364.10] up steam hardware surveys to try to justify my rage because i really really really want this thing
[3364.10 → 3370.24] to work but I cannot use Windows 10 because I will rip my eyes out um so anyway I can't use the
[3370.24 → 3376.22] freaking stream deck because I can't find the executable for the version that works uh with
[3376.22 → 3383.52] just the flag taken away i I can find I can GitHub download the like hack that removes the flag that's
[3383.52 → 3388.26] fine I can't find the executable for the installer that works that way and I don't care about whatever
[3389.00 → 3395.88] they have it doesn't matter to me at all um so yeah anyway that's why I've seen yeah there's
[3395.88 → 3400.34] basically no one running XP and vista on steam any more moral of the story there you go because
[3400.34 → 3403.22] I looked up the steam hardware surveys and yeah it's an it's a pretty small percentage
[3403.22 → 3415.46] someone in chat said Windows 10 is 55.5 Windows 7 is 33.57 Windows 8.1 is only 4.07 yeah that's fine
[3415.46 → 3424.18] my thing is if they make it work for Windows 7 which is 33.6 essentially percent of the audience
[3424.18 → 3432.60] which is a huge percentage uh it will work for 8.1 it will, or it'll be one of those situations where we
[3432.60 → 3436.88] can just remove the flag of them saying that it won't work for 8.1, and it'll install just fine
[3436.88 → 3441.68] I'm not trying to say that everyone uses Windows 8.1 I realize I'm in a very small category there but
[3441.68 → 3448.00] Windows 7 is huge and I want to lean on that to be able to get support for older versions of windows
[3448.00 → 3454.60] that will essentially include Windows 8.1 yeah because 7 to 8.1 compatibility is like very good
[3454.60 → 3464.04] um going two more is a little bit more of a stretch though so yeah yep yeah anyway that's it for the
[3464.04 → 3468.90] show oh is that it yeah I think, so there's no other topics super smash brothers is going to have
[3468.90 → 3476.18] 65 characters for switch is that not in here I'm looking right at it why did I not see it what other
[3476.18 → 3481.12] news did I miss that's basically it though okay yeah I must have just scrolled over it yeah
[3481.12 → 3487.68] it's a bazillion characters I think they said every everyone who's ever fought in a smash game is in
[3487.68 → 3496.24] this game okay is it true though because I saw people talking about Luigi was Luigi ever in a smash
[3496.24 → 3501.08] game I don't know maybe he's a trophy I don't know if you could actually select him to fight though
[3501.08 → 3501.60] I forget
[3501.60 → 3505.60] whoa
[3505.60 → 3513.88] motherboardvice.com has a counterpoint f Luigi he doesn't deserve to be in the new smash bros that's
[3513.88 → 3518.14] a little aggressive guys yeah he's kind of an irritating character I think he might have a point
[3518.14 → 3526.50] oh my goodness it's uh yeah so everyone that's in Super Smash Bros ultimate except for Luigi
[3526.50 → 3533.74] essentially Luigi missing from Super Smash Bros ultimate I don't care someone might care
[3533.74 → 3542.92] maybe he was left out intentionally maybe he'll be DLC could you imagine I could just imagine
[3542.92 → 3548.80] the storm that would happen if they had like the Luigi DLC yeah that would be hilarious to see
[3548.80 → 3554.84] that'd be great yeah cost 60 bucks for one character uh so there is a new uh score
[3554.84 → 3560.26] counter that pops up during one-on-one fights when anybody is KO'd uh each fighter has gotten some
[3560.26 → 3565.20] kind of graphical tweak to some degree which makes sense there's two new playable characters
[3565.20 → 3572.72] Ridley the alien pterodactyl boss from the metro id series and inklings the squid kids from platoon
[3572.72 → 3578.20] they were already in Mario Kart yeah just added them to smash now so I don't know if uh yeah
[3578.20 → 3583.56] anyway uh fighters must now choose their battleground stage before picking a character
[3583.56 → 3588.52] that's different it's always the other way around right yeah that's weird that actually makes sense
[3588.52 → 3593.16] it says due to professional players favouring certain stages for certain characters yeah okay that makes
[3593.16 → 3600.30] sense uh a picture in picture preview window when any combatant uh when any yeah when any combatant
[3600.30 → 3605.94] is launched off the screen that also makes sense to me um but yeah apparently it will launch on
[3605.94 → 3611.98] Nintendo Switch on December 7th 2018 cool just in time for Christmas sounds like I'll be getting
[3611.98 → 3617.04] yet another game for my switch on December 7th 2018 they should have released it on Black Friday
[3617.04 → 3623.48] just to see the meltdown oh god I'm really happy they did just like the parking lot
[3623.48 → 3631.00] butt whoopings yeah yeah yeah I would love to see that rule fight club 24 7 pretty much rule castle
[3631.00 → 3638.46] is the is the only map for me boy um but uh yeah anyway that's actually it for wan show
[3638.46 → 3644.08] that was probably loud sorry headphone users, and we'll see you next week when your ears stop bleeding
[3644.08 → 3655.60] okay
[3655.60 → 3656.70] you
[3656.70 → 3661.28] you
[3661.28 → 3670.28] you
