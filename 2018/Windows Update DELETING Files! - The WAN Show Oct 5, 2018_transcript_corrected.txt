[0.00 → 12.32] are we live I think so oh hey yeah how's it going so um
[12.32 → 25.76] so this sucks oh yeah so an uh we actually appear to have broken 3dmark.com yeah wow
[25.76 → 32.24] because that is some pretty that is some pretty broke dick um page loading that they've got going
[32.24 → 41.66] on here yikes uh because Steve from gamer nexus is live right now trying to well not trying
[41.66 → 48.62] successfully beating oh the record for single GPU times by extreme that we set in a video that went
[48.62 → 55.62] up like an hour ago where's his uh well this is all, so this includes any number of GPUs oh
[55.62 → 63.80] okay, so this is obviously kingpin yeah with four graphics cards in a technically not completely
[63.80 → 71.60] supported scenario but like oh well for you here's a driver you can see there's only like a
[71.60 → 75.34] handful of people that are running four-way SLI because it only works in benchmarks now
[75.34 → 85.56] um which is stupid but sure and then now Steve is having apparently passed jay oh wow but not by
[85.56 → 91.24] much holy crap that's really close so I think that's what people are slamming this page over
[91.24 → 99.14] and uh Steve passing jay it is not working uh Steve passing jay in SLI and passing us in single GP
[99.14 → 103.76] and he already passed you single GP oh I'm I think so I had someone told me that he already
[103.76 → 109.46] did but is our video out yet oh yeah yeah our video went up like half an hour prior and then
[109.46 → 115.34] yeah at least the video was up first at least the video held it for a point of time we held it for
[115.34 → 121.08] long enough to get the video edited barely that was really tight like I was tempted to go
[121.08 → 126.50] like super stealth about it and then I was like ah people are gonna notice on the leaderboard so i
[126.50 → 133.34] tweeted it yeah it's uh you know what interesting it was fun while it lasted we had a lot of I mean
[133.34 → 139.32] that's what this is supposed to be about because overclocking throws a bunch of salt on Twitter
[139.32 → 145.64] now that he loses a position it's all just supposed to be about fun because overclocking has no like
[145.64 → 153.32] to this degree has no practical application like i will defend that you would never actually run a
[153.32 → 161.06] system sub-zero 24 7 unless you're a complete idiot and I'm allowed to say that because I have done it
[161.06 → 172.28] that chiller setup from our video that was my 24 7 rig back when the core 2 duo e6600 was
[172.28 → 178.58] the bomb dude core 2 duos were awesome so that was like over 10 years ago I actually had my whole rig
[178.58 → 185.46] like on a board so that I could move the chiller the reservoir and the tower in one piece whenever i
[185.46 → 190.90] needed to move it from place to place and I had the whole thing like insulated permanently so i
[190.90 → 199.20] could run that 24 7, but that's really stupid and really impractical for a lot of reasons um so
[199.20 → 204.96] there's no real reason to do it other than just for the laws for bragging rights and to have some fun
[204.96 → 215.96] and i actually gotta say i am very pleased that VGA and their employee Vince uh remember king
[215.96 → 222.24] I know Vince I don't know I don't remember but I'm I'm i it's its actually kind of nice that for
[222.24 → 228.50] a change Vince has stayed out of it for the first week or so let other people have some fun because
[228.50 → 236.56] I mean at some point they're going to decide okay you know enough of gamers nexus and jay's two cents
[236.56 → 241.42] let's just let's just get this taken care of, and then he'll put up something unbeatable and whatever
[241.42 → 251.16] uh but i have to say in the spirit of fun I'm glad that VGA held the leash back for a little bit
[251.16 → 257.40] and uh, and they've they've let the the know the YouTube community kind of have some fun with this
[257.40 → 263.92] I know that cool it's been the first time I think our community has had some form of competition yep in
[263.92 → 269.42] this way yep so that's pretty cool because the reality of it is like you can kind of you can kind of
[269.42 → 276.34] extrapolate um because he's done oh wait no I think this is this new I don't know if he had single
[276.34 → 285.28] uh RTX 2080 yet oh no he did okay, but he hasn't done dual um but then if you go to number of GPUs four
[285.28 → 290.84] obviously he's using the same oh whoops sorry I'm not screen sharing with you guys obviously Vince is
[290.84 → 297.04] using the same cherry-picked 7980 he on liquid nitrogen or liquid helium or whatever the crap he's using
[297.04 → 307.08] um wait a minute hold on this is one has he beat us now did he actually like push that number though
[307.08 → 315.88] I don't know interesting uh well at any rate if you go back to forex Vince is already holding the
[315.88 → 323.64] forex record with 1080 tis and by like a huge margin so all he needs to do is take that same CPU
[323.64 → 332.06] and then use whatever cooling he feels like because he's Vince on 2080 tis and then just
[332.06 → 340.48] completely destroy everything else with that said I don't know if 2080 ti has four-way envy link okay
[340.48 → 350.76] people are saying uh rip LTT to 8446 8446 what is our single number uh 8360 okay apparently he's
[350.76 → 358.22] a lot of people are saying 8446 8446 all right you know what we had our fun Anthony and i
[358.22 → 363.94] spent uh actually it ended up taking a few days getting everything working because we had a variety
[363.94 → 370.48] of problems which even if we don't have the single uh 2080 ti record any more other than Vince
[370.48 → 375.32] he doesn't count because he's Vince um even if we don't have that any more it was a total blast you
[375.32 → 380.30] should definitely watch the video uh many shenanigans so at one point we managed to almost
[380.30 → 385.94] spray the motherboard with windshield de-ice uh okay
[385.94 → 396.26] so you know oh Geez the jank is real um anyway why don't we uh why don't we get into
[396.26 → 400.46] some topics here and have some different fun let's have some land show fun yeah yeah yeah
[400.46 → 407.46] uh congrats to Steve by the way so by beating us Steve now has other than kingpin who doesn't
[407.46 → 412.98] count the top 2080 ti score because everything above that is titan v's which obviously people
[412.98 → 417.94] have had a lot more time to spend with and potentially do the kind of crazy crap that
[417.94 → 423.04] we've seen at professional overclocking competitions where I think the most nuts thing I ever saw
[423.04 → 429.48] was a graphics card that actually had about the back third of it just hack sawed off and then
[429.48 → 436.36] had like this completely separate outboard power delivery module that was soldered onto the rest
[436.36 → 444.32] of the board and I'm just like okay I mean it was cool it was cool it was pretty cool but like didn't
[444.32 → 449.44] they even make those available for sale at some point I don't think so or like the backboard yes yeah
[449.44 → 453.76] yeah possibly, but then you would have had to have the mad soldering skills not to mention the
[453.76 → 460.12] like the diagram like the board layouts of these GPUs in order to make any kind of practical
[460.12 → 470.16] use of it um so yeah okay so what do we get for topics today right the headline uh it's its huge
[470.16 → 476.04] the Windows 10 October update potentially deleting files that's one huge headline you know what you
[476.04 → 482.20] know my favourite part about this is which one before I read out that because i I saw the October
[482.20 → 486.68] update potentially deleting files thing before I saw it in this doc yeah before I read that I was
[486.68 → 492.44] prepared to come on this show this exact when show this time to tell everyone that I was probably
[492.44 → 498.72] going to finally give in and install Windows 10 oh really I'm not making that up for like funnies
[498.72 → 504.26] reasons i I wanted to play the new Sforza so I was like oh maybe I'll just finally give up it's been
[504.26 → 515.70] long enough I'm sure it's gotten a lot better oh crap what we are live but unlisted on YouTube
[515.70 → 524.74] oops uh shout out to the two viewers that was yeah massive shout out to the two people watching on
[524.74 → 533.56] YouTube how did you find it that was a big mistake big problem right there uh oh crap i
[533.56 → 537.84] can't believe that just happened I only checked twitch I will check both I wasn't sure what the
[537.84 → 544.28] difference was between stream options make archive unlisted when complete and basic info privacy
[544.28 → 552.60] unlisted lol twitch master race right now because you guys have been watching apparently one of the
[552.60 → 560.88] people watching is uh Steve from gamers on YouTube I don't know I don't know but uh oh I'm so sorry
[560.88 → 568.36] everyone watching on YouTube because um you guys missed the first like 10 15 minutes of the show
[568.36 → 574.70] it'll be in the archive i I accidentally had it unlisted oh lord he's still learning how to use these things
[574.70 → 580.40] um, so the big story is today Windows 10 deleting files you want to recap what you were saying just now
[580.40 → 585.88] uh it's been notorious for me for a while to kind of trash on Windows 10 on the show and talk about
[585.88 → 591.34] how I don't use Windows 10 I use Windows 8.1 yeah I was planning as of like sometime last weekend
[591.34 → 596.18] yeah that I was going to update to Windows 10 because I wanted to play the new Sforza yeah um
[596.18 → 600.90] because it looks sweet it looks awesome yeah and I like just I'm not good at them at all but I like
[600.90 → 606.88] playing racing games sometimes um I'm so bad like I'm so bad like you played Sforza
[606.88 → 613.10] just racing games oh I'm so bad like what about Mario Kart did you see jay just like walk
[613.10 → 619.26] into the uh 10k gaming setup at Ltd and just completely destroy everyone that's a different
[619.26 → 625.78] situation though still you put a put a racing wheel if I can't feel the actual acceleration and
[625.78 → 632.68] braking like I'm busy staring at the speedometer and the tack and I go oh I crashed or I'm looking
[632.68 → 638.80] out the window and I go oh I'm going far too fast and crashed like I can't do it at all yeah
[638.80 → 643.90] anyway you want to play Sforza where you can feel it but anyway yeah for more realistic racing games
[643.90 → 647.42] I'm terrible at them, I'm pretty good at Mario Kart, but none of those real things wanted to play it
[647.42 → 651.84] anyway was like you know what I'll give up I'll finally install Windows 10 I'm sure they've gotten
[651.84 → 658.56] a lot better uh over the last like quite a while as I've been using old operating systems um and then
[658.56 → 663.94] this week the week I was planning on announcing that i I read the news article that the new update
[663.94 → 670.36] is maybe going to just delete people's files brilliant so we'll get into that later and then
[670.36 → 678.76] the actual big news like with far larger implications is that china apparently infiltrated apple and Amazon
[678.76 → 687.84] and multiple other companies with a hardware security compromise uh so we'll get into that quite a bit
[687.84 → 695.26] more later allegedly allegedly allegedly let's go ahead and run the intro allegedly well we're
[695.26 → 700.64] actually running the intro yeah allegedly I'm just being very careful on this episode
[700.64 → 703.44] very careful
[703.44 → 722.66] like just let our video go up and like to let the momentum start to go down a little bit we had
[722.66 → 730.00] to just get right in there and crap all over it which I mean we've I don't think we're going to take
[730.00 → 736.24] another run at it like realistically it's a lot it's actually a lot of work and so you know mad
[736.24 → 743.40] respect to the people who you know get top scores and stuff um but i think i think we're done
[743.40 → 748.94] I mean really what we wanted to do was come out of nowhere having not acknowledged what was going
[748.94 → 756.16] on at all and just be like womb okay bye, but then we didn't have an envy link bridge so we couldn't do
[756.16 → 762.42] SLI which is what everyone else was kind of focused on, but that's probably fine anyway because we don't
[762.42 → 769.32] have the same godlike CPU that jay has, and we only even tried one GPU yeah we were just like okay hopefully
[769.32 → 779.26] this one's pretty Reece here we go um yeah so we got lucky we got lucky all right speaking of
[779.26 → 785.40] getting lucky why don't we just open with this so it was posted by spartaman64 on the forum the original
[785.40 → 798.56] article here is from Bloomberg and there is a fair bit of kind of um uncorroborated information in this
[798.56 → 804.52] article what's up that people are yelling that there's a Bloomberg thing that there's a Bloomberg
[804.52 → 811.56] thing or sorry that there's a super chat oh there's a super chat oh fake news on the Bloomberg article
[811.56 → 818.06] yeah we are gonna talk about that yeah oh boy I think that's the one they're actually talking about
[818.06 → 825.56] okay so um we know there 's's some weird stuff in the Bloomberg article we'll talk about
[825.56 → 834.16] that later we'll talk about we'll talk about that um gamers nexus just sent us a super chat
[834.16 → 841.84] when and you know the funny thing about this is like we were just trying to be nice you know
[841.84 → 849.28] by beating all we were just trying to no, no we bring more attention to no we we sent them a
[849.28 → 855.82] super chat oh during their live stream yeah, yeah so we were just trying to be nice I mean the fact
[855.82 → 865.02] that it was 84 and 46 cents which happens to be the single GPU score oh that knocked them out
[865.02 → 874.06] is a coincidence and there's really no reason for Steve to get all salty about it and like return the
[874.06 → 880.16] money because I mean really it wasn't about like you know getting attention over
[880.16 → 885.80] on his live stream or whatever this was about wanting to be supportive of his efforts I mean you
[885.80 → 892.36] can you know you can break a lot of hardware you know treating it the way that he is right now
[892.36 → 899.58] so it's its just we care about the hardware more yeah yeah exactly, exactly yeah we still want to
[899.58 → 904.50] break things yeah, and we have a lot of respect for Steve which is why we wanted to support him
[904.50 → 910.56] and the valuable work that he does yeah with our 84 and 46 cents donate to gamers nexus today yeah
[910.56 → 917.64] all right anyway they don't need our charity, but they might need you yeah they might need yours
[917.64 → 925.76] oops okay so let's go ahead and let's let's run through this here shall be so a Bloomberg report
[925.76 → 931.06] claims claims claims allegedly that china spies have carried out the most significant
[931.06 → 936.28] supply chain attack ever known against American companies and what they mean by a supply chain
[936.28 → 946.30] attack is that instead of trying to um to steal data by intercepting network traffic or by um gaining
[946.30 → 952.74] physical access to a server that is already configured and already running uh and then and then steal the
[952.74 → 961.30] data that way a supply chain attack would have the attacker actually hijack the shipment physically
[961.30 → 967.74] oftentimes between two parties neither of which are aware of what's going on yeah make some kind of
[967.74 → 975.04] change and then forward it again without either party becoming aware of what's going on so here's
[975.04 → 982.56] the story allegedly according to the Bloomberg report so in 2015 Amazon began evaluating American
[982.56 → 988.58] startup called elemental technologies Ada Ada Ada that became Amazon Prime video so as part of
[988.58 → 993.72] their due diligence Amazon hired a third-party company to scrutinize their security elemental was
[993.72 → 999.24] apparently using allegedly servers assembled by Supermicro so we're familiar with Supermicro we've
[999.24 → 1005.06] used a fair bit of Supermicro's gear ourselves including our main file storage server um I think
[1005.06 → 1010.58] they're also pretty well known overall yeah so they were sent to Ontario for testing the testers found a
[1010.58 → 1014.52] tiny microchip about the size of a grain of rice that wasn't part of the board's original design
[1014.52 → 1021.96] the chip apparently allegedly incorporated memory networking capability and sufficient processing power
[1021.96 → 1029.02] for an attack so allegedly when the server was installed and switched on the microchip could alter
[1029.02 → 1033.78] the operating system's core so it could accept modifications and the chip could contact computers
[1033.78 → 1039.16] controlled by the attackers for further instructions and code, so the primary role of an implant like this
[1039.16 → 1044.96] would be to open doors that other attackers can go through depending on the board model allegedly
[1044.96 → 1049.40] the chips varied slightly in size suggesting that the attackers had supplied different factories with
[1049.40 → 1055.02] different batches Amazon allegedly reported the discovery to the U.S. authorities at this time
[1055.02 → 1060.42] allegedly and at this time as well elemental servers could be found in department of defence data
[1060.42 → 1066.42] centres the CIA's drone operations and the onboard networks of navy warships, but elemental was just one of
[1066.42 → 1076.08] hundreds of super micro customers so the uh allegedly ensuing top secret probe remains open today more
[1076.08 → 1080.82] than three years later with investigators determining that the chips allowed attackers to create a stealth
[1080.82 → 1086.38] doorway into any network that included the altered machines now allegedly a lot of these things
[1086.38 → 1098.84] don't initially necessarily pass a sniff test here even, even like for not super technical people yeah like here can I give my idiot
[1098.84 → 1103.92] version of why a lot of this doesn't make a ton of sense okay and then I'll let you go sure okay
[1103.92 → 1112.58] so a chip on a motherboard unless you're running your router with like um what's it called the autoconfiguring
[1112.58 → 1121.28] stupid thing yeah WPS w no um man that's the auto connecting thing if that's what you're talking about
[1121.28 → 1122.46] yeah no not that one
[1122.46 → 1130.82] what's it called uh UPnP okay yeah unless you're running a router with UPnP
[1130.82 → 1138.78] to my knowledge there is no way that a machine on the network can reconfigure the ports
[1138.78 → 1142.52] that your network has opened and how they're forwarded
[1142.52 → 1148.50] so there 's's even more stuff than just that okay, but that's just that's just the first thing
[1148.50 → 1155.52] yeah so one thing I noticed but wasn't good enough with electronics to really yeah dive further into
[1155.52 → 1161.02] but then was super happy that Wendell started talking about it on Twitter yeah was that like a chip
[1161.02 → 1167.86] of literally that size and that in that place those connections yeah it would have to be like a two to
[1167.86 → 1174.00] four pin chip right like what is it doing yeah what can you do with two pins so and people started
[1174.00 → 1179.22] diving more into that, but it's like it's already weird just at that level yeah and like this is way
[1179.22 → 1183.72] beyond me so I don't know but the first hardware thing that stood out to me, and we should go ahead
[1183.72 → 1188.26] and we should pop this uh this article open here again and one thing I want to add is that people
[1188.26 → 1193.84] far better at this stuff than Linus and I are noticing these things yeah so this was the first
[1193.84 → 1198.76] thing that popped out to me here's the board, and you can see they're kind of stripping off components
[1198.76 → 1205.92] as we go here and here's the chip so i just I'm gonna I'm going to print screen this real quick
[1205.92 → 1220.86] here there we go uh mspaint saves the day okay can we not shrink this really oh paint
[1220.86 → 1229.24] can you just why why why okay resize here we go percentage uh I don't I don't know 40 percent
[1229.24 → 1238.08] there we go good enough all right so here's the issue so this uh this is a type of motherboard that
[1238.08 → 1243.10] is pretty typical and what are they called blade servers yeah, so this is where you basically are just
[1243.10 → 1250.36] sliding an entire computer into a small bay in a larger chassis that would contain multiple computers
[1250.36 → 1257.32] so this is really high density stuff here all right, so the location was like somewhere
[1257.32 → 1266.28] around here and the Bloomberg article reports that it was able to get memory information I'm kind of
[1266.28 → 1276.70] sitting here going how because this is your main motherboard chipset as far as I can tell and this
[1276.70 → 1283.20] they've actually they seem to have blanked out yeah some of the details on this, but this isn't much
[1283.20 → 1291.62] and I don't know the most about PCB layout and board design for sure yeah but what I do know is that
[1291.62 → 1299.92] you don't go out of your way to run traces like this well definitely not on a curve but like yeah you
[1299.92 → 1303.88] don't want to run them far definitely you don't want to run them any further than you have to except in
[1303.88 → 1310.76] very specific instances like for example memory high speed memory can benefit from little zigzags
[1310.76 → 1316.34] so you'll see little zigzags in some traces, and then you'll see straight uh straight traces running
[1316.34 → 1324.50] to other places so for example let's say this is a CPU and this is the like you know four dim slots
[1324.50 → 1329.96] next to it so in some can you hold this for me please sure thank you sir so in some cases you might see
[1329.96 → 1337.04] straight traces going out to the extremities, and then you might see zigzag traces going here and
[1337.04 → 1341.88] that's because when you're going real fast I'm good when you're going real fast it can
[1341.88 → 1348.38] actually the difference in the arrival timing of the electrons can make a difference on that scale
[1348.38 → 1355.00] so anyway but for something where you're transferring I wasn't fully listening to what you're saying because I was
[1355.00 → 1360.02] reading chat but AJ saying no it's to match the length of the lengths of the traces I know i just
[1360.02 → 1367.64] said that oh I don't know it's just trying to put his input in their oh okay that was the okay, okay if
[1367.64 → 1372.08] it wasn't clear then it's really important that that's clear the reason that they're zigzagging here
[1372.08 → 1376.42] is because that's a shorter distance and the reason that they're not zigzagging at the extremities
[1376.42 → 1381.50] is because that's a longer distance so you got a zigzag here so that the traces are all the same length
[1381.50 → 1390.30] so that the timing doesn't get bunged up all right so anyway that chip in order to have access to
[1390.30 → 1396.52] memory what was it memory networking and what else allegedly was it did it have access to here
[1396.52 → 1405.60] hold on let me go let me go back to our notes um doorway into network etc uh what's that uh
[1405.60 → 1412.62] I don't necessarily want to say it holds on ah interesting answer phone everyone's spamming that
[1412.62 → 1415.68] oh I had my phone on silent
[1415.68 → 1421.82] what do you want
[1421.82 → 1428.68] so first I have you on speaker don't say anything uh, but you don't want to reflect poorly
[1428.68 → 1433.32] on your image i I don't think anything that I do could reflect poorly on my image
[1433.32 → 1439.16] I think people are kind of used to my nonsense at this point what can I do for you
[1439.16 → 1446.74] uh this is fine because uh our chat said that you uh you read our message and I wanted to make sure
[1446.74 → 1454.86] you know it wasn't just oh, oh no my feelings are super hurt actually so you know that uh you
[1454.86 → 1460.34] know that event that um that you went ahead and attended last year when we kind of like
[1460.34 → 1466.24] buried the hatchet and stuff like you were there for that right because I had really
[1466.24 → 1470.58] understood that the hatchet was buried, and now it really feels it feels like the hatchet has been
[1470.58 → 1478.98] pulled out but like not out of the stump you know not not not out of the stump look Steve-O never
[1478.98 → 1487.38] pull out okay that's why I got a vasectomy okay so look it feels like the hatchet that you pulled
[1487.38 → 1493.64] out was not in a stump but actually in my chest and I'm bleeding right now steve I'm bleeding
[1493.64 → 1501.62] I'm so sorry lion uh is there anything I can do to make it to stop the bleeding
[1501.62 → 1512.48] you know what just just don't show up at Ltd next year oh just don't show up even though
[1512.48 → 1518.32] and then you know what this is breaking news actually we had a great chat with uh we're not
[1518.32 → 1524.76] going to name any names, but we had a great chat with an unnamed large land party organizer
[1524.76 → 1536.64] and it looks like don't name them, and it looks like Ltd had somewhat confirmed next year is going to be
[1536.64 → 1545.94] more than double the footprint with a BYOC LAN that is going to have capacity for hundreds of gamers
[1545.94 → 1551.98] oh my god that is actually amazing and by the way steve I'm totally joking you have to be there it's
[1551.98 → 1558.28] gonna it's gonna rock and of course I'm just messing with you uh thank you for uh thank you for thank
[1558.28 → 1563.78] you for being uh hilarious in all this should consider doing yeah thanks for keeping it going I think it
[1563.78 → 1567.88] was good for the community, and you were streaming so you missed it but i actually just pre-called
[1567.88 → 1573.04] like the hell out of Ltd so I'm glad to hear you're joking because I'd have to take all that
[1573.04 → 1578.76] oh yeah no way man it's going to be so much better next year we are really looking forward to it and
[1578.76 → 1583.98] I mean i just, just so everyone knows like these events don't happen overnight like we are absolutely
[1583.98 → 1587.36] already working on if it's not going to be happening for like another eight or nine months but
[1587.36 → 1592.74] yeah I'm looking forward to it and uh I know I've kind of missed you at the last couple of events i
[1592.74 → 1596.84] don't even think either of us went to uh went to the thread ripper 2 things did you go
[1596.84 → 1606.08] no, no okay well if nothing else I'll see you at CES right sounds good yeah all right okay cool man
[1606.08 → 1614.58] all right bye Steve all right bye Steve you guys should consider just for fun yeah having like an
[1614.58 → 1621.50] over a live overclocking panel you could even throw in like make it weird hardware or something
[1621.50 → 1627.90] I would actually I've always duos in 98 hundreds I've always had more fun overclocking like weird
[1627.90 → 1633.02] stuff yeah like get like GT 710s and then just see totally just yeah yeah yeah go to town that'd be
[1633.02 → 1639.56] sweet like bring in some weird hardware and have a little like overclocking thing anyway uh so
[1639.56 → 1649.14] thank you to raging gamer um uh Sam Landis and uh Paco sends who all messaged with super chat here I'm
[1649.14 → 1654.44] just seeing it now to answer my phone sorry I had it muted because I'm trying to be a bit more of a
[1654.44 → 1659.38] professional streamer now um because like my phone would go off all the time during streams in the
[1659.38 → 1666.44] past anyway so uh yeah i I just don't get people who think that there's any kind of real like
[1666.44 → 1672.72] animosity between us Steve jay like any of those people and that's one thing that the computer hardware
[1672.72 → 1677.68] review community has had for a long time because we've all been kind of friends for quite a long time
[1677.68 → 1682.86] which has been cool there are a couple of notable exceptions well but I'm not going to name any
[1682.86 → 1690.20] names but I will say that none of them are YouTubers like anyone who thinks that you know me and
[1690.20 → 1698.62] anyone has any kind of beef like uh or that we're we even really think of each other as competitors like
[1698.62 → 1707.08] um yeah like awesome's coming to dinner like tomorrow yeah just hanging out not making videos
[1707.08 → 1712.56] because sometimes that that's nice to do anyway let's get back to let's get back to the chip so
[1712.56 → 1721.20] all right so in response to my initial sort of reaction here like what could possibly affect all
[1721.20 → 1727.42] those things apparently what it was supposed to affect was PMI which I've actually made a video
[1727.42 → 1736.14] about in the past and what PMI is it is remote access to the server, and it does allow you to
[1736.14 → 1742.36] pretty much control the thing so you can get a video feed out uh you can actually uh power it up and down
[1742.36 → 1749.30] you can uh change bio settings you can change pretty much anything that you would like about it
[1749.30 → 1760.18] sort of so back to the allegedly all right um, so investigators found that the chips had been
[1760.18 → 1765.94] inserted at factories run by manufacturing subcontractors in China who make 75 of the world's
[1765.94 → 1771.22] mobile phones and 90 of its pcs they also found eventually that it affected almost 30 companies
[1771.22 → 1775.26] including a major bank government contractors and the world's most valuable company apple
[1775.26 → 1781.58] um in May 2015, so this is going way back in time apple allegedly found malicious chips on super
[1781.58 → 1785.46] micro motherboards and severed ties with super micro the following year though for what it described
[1785.46 → 1794.30] as unrelated reasons so here's the part where this gets really tricky here's the list of everyone who
[1794.30 → 1803.20] has denied this Amazon said this is quoted it is untrue that AWS knew about a supply chain compromise
[1803.20 → 1808.64] an issue with malicious chips or hardware modifications when acquiring elemental apple said
[1808.64 → 1815.22] on this we can be very clear they have such an apple way of talking don't they apple has never found
[1815.22 → 1820.76] malicious chips hardware manipulations or vulnerabilities purposely planted in any server
[1820.76 → 1827.46] super micro we remain unaware of any such investigation the Chinese government
[1827.46 → 1833.56] supply chain safety in cyberspace is an issue of common concern and china is also a victim
[1833.56 → 1841.90] okay that's not really the strongest denial no, no but the FBI cis and NSA said no comment
[1841.90 → 1848.60] now the company's denials are countered by six current and former senior national security
[1848.60 → 1853.16] officials who in conversations that began during the Obama administration and continued under the trump
[1853.16 → 1856.34] administration detailed the discovery of the chips and the government's investigation
[1856.34 → 1862.16] in all 17 people confirmed the manipulation of super micro's hardware and other elements of the
[1862.16 → 1867.30] attacks are those actually confirmed or is that claimed by Bloomberg this is all claimed by Bloomberg yeah
[1867.30 → 1881.28] so yeah I don't know me, so there's more allegedly so here 's's part of the problem with all of this
[1881.28 → 1896.64] a denial is interesting um but not necessarily the be all and end all it's not like apple is going to
[1896.64 → 1905.86] you know yeah all of our networks were compromised yeah well actually they would just verify
[1905.86 → 1912.86] why would they as long as they've fixed it now and again allegedly one government official said that
[1912.86 → 1921.30] no consumer data was known to have been stolen so if apple has found the problem fixed the problem and
[1921.30 → 1925.46] doesn't have to worry about this problem popping up at any point in the future
[1925.46 → 1932.50] than okay why would they go ahead and broadcast this on their own
[1932.50 → 1939.18] one interesting thing for me how is super micro strip saying we remain unaware of any such investigation
[1939.18 → 1944.42] it's just kind of interesting that these it's its so
[1944.42 → 1951.26] it's so much of a blanket no, so apple says nope we've never seen anything like this in a server
[1951.26 → 1956.98] and china says we're a victim too yeah that's pretty weird well that's a little weird
[1956.98 → 1963.86] so I'm not much of a tinfoil hat conspiracy theory nut but I can understand why it would be that these
[1963.86 → 1970.62] companies have issued denials and that everyone is speaking um under condition of anonymity on something
[1970.62 → 1977.94] like this because you might have a NDA, or you might be subject to criminal prosecution
[1977.94 → 1983.18] if you were to talk about it that's true um that's very fair
[1983.18 → 1994.46] so now would they go to Bloomberg I don't know it's a wonderful question so all we can really do
[1994.46 → 2003.34] is said hey here's what was reported by Bloomberg who has not typically been known to be complete yahoos
[2003.34 → 2012.94] um here's all the denials that have been issued and there were lots of them and um make of that what you will
[2012.94 → 2020.94] I mean the FBI cis and NSA not commenting is not really a denial to be clear yep those are listed under
[2020.94 → 2028.94] denials, but that's not really a denial the only way that we could know for sure would be if independent
[2028.94 → 2035.98] owners of super micro servers contacted super micro asked for a board layout diagram and check their
[2035.98 → 2041.90] motherboards to see if these chips were present now the problem with that is that this all allegedly
[2041.90 → 2047.74] happened a few years ago and depending on the upgrade cycle of any given data centre
[2048.86 → 2054.22] it would be fairly simple it would be fairly straightforward for these middlemen to
[2054.22 → 2059.42] intercept only large-scale orders intended for particular customers and if the goal wasn't going
[2059.42 → 2065.82] after end users then the goal probably also isn't your mom and pop you know YouTube channel like us
[2065.82 → 2071.02] and the motherboard in their one-off super micro server it was probably looking for these bulk orders
[2071.02 → 2076.62] that were um that were subcontracted out because otherwise I believe super micro actually has their
[2076.62 → 2083.26] own manufacturing capabilities don't quote me on that one so depending on the upgrade cycle of the
[2083.26 → 2087.50] data centres of the companies they were targeting or depending on their policies some of them just
[2087.50 → 2092.46] destroy hardware rather than flipping it one bay whereas others do like you'll see you know when
[2093.02 → 2098.14] a hundred gigabit networking gets to the point where it's affordable and practical all of a sudden
[2098.14 → 2103.66] you'll see a bunch of 40 gigabit enterprise gear just flood eBay um but not everyone some do that but
[2103.66 → 2108.46] some of them don't so we don't know if any of these servers because we don't know what models they are
[2108.46 → 2114.14] are had ended up one bay or have ended up in the hands of individual users, so there's still certainly
[2114.94 → 2122.94] more to come on all of this but all we can say is what we know for now which is nothing for certain
[2122.94 → 2128.46] for the moment and all right I'm going to drop a plug here real quick oh for my thing is that cool oh yeah
[2128.46 → 2134.22] yeah go for it speaking of servers and infrastructure if you guys are into that uh I thought I was done
[2134.22 → 2140.70] hiring for a little while but apparently not flow plane media is looking for a system administer uh
[2140.70 → 2148.38] administrator uh and what I was reading that for a second um and is looking for people to apply
[2148.38 → 2152.86] now I'm posting in the twitch chat I can't, I don't have access to the YouTube thing right now, but it will
[2152.86 → 2157.98] be in the description on YouTube later on it'll be on the description of everything so feel free to
[2157.98 → 2164.70] apply the form is like pretty long and asks if you have experience with a ton of different things
[2164.70 → 2169.10] if you don't have experience with everything on the list that's okay we're just trying to get a picture
[2169.10 → 2174.46] of who you are and what types of things you have experience with having experience with Linux
[2174.46 → 2179.50] administration is obviously pretty important but the rest of them are a little bit more flexible
[2180.30 → 2182.46] cool Microsoft experience does not help
[2182.46 → 2190.46] uh dang it just well it doesn't right dang it doesn't really cross over time uh let's go ahead
[2190.46 → 2197.98] and uh run through our sponsors here, so synergy yeah synergy lets you juggle multiple computers
[2197.98 → 2203.66] efficiently, so there are lots of reasons for people to have more than one computer whether you've got a
[2203.66 → 2209.34] windows box for gaming and a Linux box for whatever it is you do on Linux or you have a mac for work and
[2209.34 → 2213.82] you've got a Windows machine for home or vice versa or whatever the case may be it can be a bit of a
[2213.82 → 2219.10] pain in the butt, and you end up with like multiple keyboards and mice or trackpads and you kind
[2219.10 → 2224.38] of go ah yeah okay I know I'm using this one now okay, so synergy makes it easy you can just take
[2224.38 → 2228.46] whatever operating system you want to run it on whatever computer you want, and then you can just seamlessly
[2228.46 → 2233.34] use one keyboard and mouse to just move the cursor across computers start typing move it across to a
[2233.34 → 2239.02] different computer start typing you can control them all at the same time it works on Linux macOS
[2239.02 → 2244.70] windows and multiple versions of windows so the cool demo that we did a while back was with that
[2244.70 → 2250.46] quad input monitor yeah that actually had um four different operating systems running on it that we
[2250.46 → 2254.62] were able to seamlessly switch between and use whatever we wanted that's pretty, pretty freaking
[2254.62 → 2261.74] cool so check it out over at seamless.com synergy Linus tech tips next up we've got be quiet oh
[2261.74 → 2268.70] interesting do we have like the case here I guess it's pretty big, so to be quiet dark base pro
[2268.70 → 2275.18] 900 orange rev 2 oh that was that modular case that was like one of the last cases you reviewed
[2275.18 → 2280.86] like way back in the day so they have a v2 of that now so it's modular it's compatible, and it looks
[2280.86 → 2286.62] pretty slick the motherboard tray can be decoupled and relocated also it can even be used as a test bench
[2286.62 → 2291.34] it's got modular hard drive slots it supports up to five hard drives 10 SSDs and two optical drives if
[2291.34 → 2295.26] you're still into that sort of thing it's got a functional power supply shroud that doesn't just hide the
[2295.26 → 2300.14] power supply it can even be used to mount a SSD or a fan while leaving enough space for a radiator
[2300.14 → 2307.50] in the front it's got tempered glass and LEDs you know because it's 2018 and for Io it supports USB 3.1
[2307.50 → 2311.82] type c, and it's also got a wireless charger for chi enabled smartphones you can check it out on
[2311.82 → 2321.26] new egg at the link below the video finally savage jerky oh boy oh, oh we got a new shipment I'm just
[2321.26 → 2325.18] going to sit here and eat maple buffalo bacon, and you're not going for the reaper again this week
[2325.18 → 2332.62] no, no i I did that last time so savage jerky as you guys know they've been on here a ton uh they have
[2332.62 → 2339.58] a bunch of different awesome flavours 13 to be exact of their different uh jerky including bacon
[2339.58 → 2344.46] which is I believe what you're going for right now yeah maple buffalo bacon uh they also make barbecue
[2344.46 → 2349.98] sauce hot sauce and spice rub I stole some of that last week ha ha ha um their hot sauces oh it says
[2349.98 → 2354.62] right here the hot sauces are so good Luke and Linus took them home yeah so we don't actually have
[2355.58 → 2360.54] a like display bottle right now they're perfect though the last one that was here was um
[2361.66 → 2369.26] oh what is it called jalapeño mojo okay my like favourite flavour I don't remember the exact name of it
[2369.26 → 2374.70] but something mojo um anyway it's its it's perfect stuff the jerky is made with the best
[2374.70 → 2379.02] ingredients without nitrates or preservatives with a goal to create a snack that is full of flavour and
[2379.02 → 2384.70] spice that isn't bad for you use offer code LTT to save 10 off of their products you can see the
[2384.70 → 2392.46] link here or in the description if you're watching later on jerky I know right all right let's talk
[2392.46 → 2401.34] about Windows 10 oh boy, so this was posted by Dan Castellano on the front castle Castellano
[2401.34 → 2409.74] Castellano dang it Homer Simpson that's just his username on the forum not the real not the
[2409.74 → 2415.34] real Homer Simpson, so the original article here is from zone and basically
[2417.42 → 2422.70] it's always recommended like that's the funny thing about this is it's always recommended when
[2422.70 → 2430.38] you perform an update to back up your data yeah but like over the last couple of years is it faded
[2430.38 → 2436.30] is it the smartphone shift in the industry that I don't think so because like it used to be that you
[2436.30 → 2440.54] got a warning even on like a smartphone because you don't any more you don't anymore and windows
[2440.54 → 2445.26] update's all automatic they try to barely touch it because people used to complain about it all the time
[2445.26 → 2452.62] but that's always been considered best practice and then now when everyone's gotten lax about it
[2453.58 → 2461.02] it's finally happening allegedly and not just like a file or two apparently one user is claiming to
[2461.02 → 2472.78] have lost 220 gigs of data after updating like so the version number is Windows 10 1809, and it says here
[2472.78 → 2480.62] if you get a warning about intel drivers do not proceed okay so all the AMD fanboys are like
[2483.26 → 2486.06] so it appears to be related to some interaction with one drive
[2486.94 → 2491.58] no great where documents saved in the user directory and not one drive will be deleted oh
[2494.46 → 2498.86] okay that's the reverse of what I thought was going to happen and that's so much worse it also
[2498.86 → 2502.62] appears that if you've done anything non-standard with one drive or you're my documents
[2502.62 → 2508.54] folder it may place your files at risk and all right went down the wrong pipe one second
[2509.50 → 2515.26] i I definitely have and I think a lot of people here have now that it's the most practical
[2515.26 → 2519.26] way especially if you're running a single box, and you don't have a NAS the most practical way to run
[2519.26 → 2525.58] your storage these days economically is to have a small boot SSD for most of your programs and stuff
[2525.58 → 2531.82] and then a large hard drive for your mass storage yeah and the problem is that windows automatically
[2531.82 → 2538.14] puts you're my documents on your c drive because Microsoft still lives in the land of single
[2538.14 → 2543.90] drives and computers um it's just it's just baffling to me that it's just not automatically tiered anyway
[2543.90 → 2551.18] a whole other conversation um but anyway so a really common thing for people to do because a lot of
[2551.18 → 2556.46] programs without asking will just automatically dump crap in my documents my pictures my videos
[2556.46 → 2560.30] like that kind of thing so what a lot of users will do if they're managing their data correctly
[2560.30 → 2564.70] in fact I think we did a guide that's got like over a million views over on NCI tech tips showing
[2564.70 → 2571.42] people how to do this is they'll remap those stock system folders to a folder on their mechanical
[2571.42 → 2578.62] hard drive so if you did that it appears that it might place your files at risk and rolling back
[2578.62 → 2587.74] the installation does not restore the missing files wow the rollback not restoring the files
[2589.66 → 2595.10] in my opinion is worse than it deleting the files in the first place oh yeah way worse
[2595.10 → 2601.10] that's gnarly and since we're on the subject what does this Windows update even offer well
[2601.10 → 2607.18] this was posted by goodbyes on the forum mostly minor changes and to be clear goodbyes is constantly
[2607.18 → 2615.74] pointed out as being a hardcore Microsoft fanboy yeah um mostly minor changes some features like
[2615.74 → 2621.58] sets and alt tab bringing up browser tabs have been delayed so your phone an app that your phone an
[2621.58 → 2625.98] app that will allow you to better interact with your phone from your pc allows you to send and receive
[2625.98 → 2630.70] SMS messages and interact with your 25 most recent images from your gallery on an android phone so that's
[2630.70 → 2636.78] cool but then that should also be coming to Windows 10 version 1803 so while it's headlining as
[2636.78 → 2641.58] an 1809 feature it's actually an independent app there's a new clipboard history that syncs with the
[2641.58 → 2646.14] cloud and works across devices so it's being added to swift key on iOS and android that's pretty cool
[2646.14 → 2651.02] that's that is actually pretty cool that is legitimately quite cool also comes to the Windows 10 on-screen
[2651.02 → 2655.26] keyboard with this update I can't believe that took so long Microsoft bought swift key what like two years
[2655.26 → 2660.94] ago or something anyway there's a dark theme for file explorer I okay I can see people wanting to
[2660.94 → 2666.94] update for that snipping tool is being deprecated being replaced by a new snipping experience no that
[2666.94 → 2671.90] can be opened with wind shift s I don't know it might be fine I mean do you not use share at
[2671.90 → 2680.30] this point anyway yeah okay and the usual improvements to Microsoft Edge browser want more but like on
[2680.30 → 2685.66] systems that I haven't used before having snipping tools really nice new emoji notepad improvements
[2687.10 → 2693.26] so all of that sounds worth giving up some data over right okay, okay if there wasn't if there wasn't
[2693.26 → 2699.26] the data loss i will throw them this phone if there wasn't the data loss if you were uh if you
[2699.26 → 2704.06] were able to recover your data with a system rollback so if they weren't boning you'd throw them
[2705.74 → 2710.22] yeah pretty much this does actually sound like a decent update yeah dark theme is cool the phone app
[2710.22 → 2717.26] thing is cool the swift key copy and paste cloud thing is cool uh but yeah i kind of need my files so
[2717.26 → 2727.58] shoddy not all right and finally MacBook Pro and iMac pros require apple's diagnostics for certain repairs
[2729.98 → 2735.82] ot2 chip so you know about the t2 chip right so that's the encryption chip on some of apple's new
[2735.82 → 2741.58] devices that basically makes it so that let's talk about the good things first um someone who steals
[2741.58 → 2746.94] your device can't get your data I mean it's cool that's pretty cool yeah, but it does other stuff
[2747.90 → 2757.74] so on the 2018 MacBook Pro repairs involving the logic board okay touch ID all right that's security related
[2757.74 → 2769.58] the battery the keyboard the display the top casing and the track the trackpad and the speakers the
[2769.58 → 2777.74] speakers is my favourite part the speakers really to be fair the keyboard battery trackpad and speakers
[2777.74 → 2785.74] are all only included because of the top case so the t2 chip if you complete is you complete repairs like
[2785.74 → 2796.78] those without apple's blessing will brick your MacBook Pro if you replace a broken speaker now on the iMac Pro
[2796.78 → 2803.10] this makes more sense logic board and flash storage repairs okay fine so if any of those parts are
[2803.10 → 2810.06] repaired and apple diagnostics are not run the system will be inoperative, and the repair will be incomplete
[2810.06 → 2817.02] now the apple diagnostic suite is limited to internal use by Apple stores and apple authorized service
[2817.02 → 2822.78] providers so independent repair shops without apple certification may be unable to repair certain
[2822.78 → 2826.38] parts of these machines and in the case of the macBook it's like basically anything
[2829.26 → 2834.54] um now apparently the t2 chip does include more than I thought so system management controller signal
[2834.54 → 2841.42] image signal processor audio controller and SSD controller and the secure enclave but why did it
[2841.42 → 2847.10] have to include the audio controller I'm sure apple has some kind of reason for that but then they also
[2848.14 → 2851.98] could recognize that replacing a speaker is probably benign
[2854.30 → 2860.78] really frustrating nothing we say or do is going to change anything I mean apple very intentionally because
[2860.78 → 2866.70] you bet your butt they noticed the videos that we made about our experience with the iMac Pro
[2866.70 → 2871.74] very intentionally has not acknowledged us they've not reached out offering to help or anything like
[2871.74 → 2877.50] that so apple's just clearly going yeah I think we're just going to keep doing this because people aren't
[2877.50 → 2884.30] upset enough so and the frustrating thing that rhymes is it seems to be it seems to be spreading I mean you
[2884.30 → 2887.82] and I were talking about this the other day so one of the reasons that I went with a Chevy volt
[2887.82 → 2893.74] was that I am really not a fan of what tesla is doing with respect to right to repair um the fact
[2893.74 → 2899.82] that they are limiting people basically limiting the ability to work on these vehicles to people who
[2899.82 → 2905.82] have their you know magic wand blessing why exactly is that why do we accept that as consumers and there's
[2905.82 → 2913.90] YouTubers who have made careers out of trying to find ways to like forcibly repair teslas did you watch the
[2913.90 → 2918.46] same documentary I did then I don't think I've watched the documentary I don't know it was YouTube
[2918.46 → 2924.22] video, but it was in a doc-y style very likely then I forgot the guy what the guy's name was yeah yeah
[2924.22 → 2931.10] yeah he's awesome yeah basically like awesome dude he's super awesome flat out um and so it's really
[2931.10 → 2934.70] impressive the kind of stuff yeah I don't really understand why we're supporting these things
[2935.50 → 2941.18] because it is blatantly anti-consumer yeah period yeah because the security there are some okay there are
[2941.18 → 2946.78] some legitimate concerns in both of these areas yes to defend them a little bit yeah electric guitars
[2946.78 → 2954.30] can be pretty electric guitars it's my day today man I'm just on point electric cars can be a little
[2954.30 → 2962.78] bit problematic if repaired poorly but like so can normal cars explosions and stuff right like I don't
[2962.78 → 2969.74] know this doesn't seem super hard to understand that like you're there's some liability involved in
[2969.74 → 2976.54] repairing something but generally with most countries laws if the owner of the item is
[2976.54 → 2981.18] repairing it they're taking personal liability for the repair and if you pay a shop to repair it that
[2981.18 → 2988.62] shop is taking liability for the repair and the reality of it is that this industry of like basically
[2989.34 → 2998.06] massive like buckets of explosive fuel that people ride around in has been around for an awful long
[2998.06 → 3006.94] time yeah and I think we've as correct me if I'm wrong but I'm not aware of any situation where
[3007.50 → 3015.66] a repair does a repaired something somehow like a repaired ford came back to ford somehow because of an
[3015.66 → 3022.94] error that the repair technician made I don't know I mean correct me if I'm wrong please do yeah I'm not
[3022.94 → 3028.62] I don't I don't know honestly I'm sure it has happened some dude tried to fix his ford and then
[3029.26 → 3032.14] when he failed he brought it to ford and ford was like what the heck dude
[3034.30 → 3039.82] I don't know, but that's fine oh you're talking like a repair happened on a vehicle, and then it blew
[3039.82 → 3044.62] up or something and then ford got in trouble yeah I'm not aware of anything like that happening yeah
[3044.62 → 3051.58] personally I don't know all right we've got a couple of super chats um serpent CFS appreciate the love among
[3051.58 → 3058.54] tech tubers look forward to next year's Ltd hashtag never pull out rock on man uh spencer says so
[3058.54 → 3067.50] Microsoft can fix the update right thanks spencer that's good uh vast horizon I'd send more but this
[3067.50 → 3074.14] is all I can afford I love you guys though oh well thank you uh Jordan been watching guys a little over
[3074.14 → 3078.86] a year you guys boosted my interest in a tech career currently attending college for cities keep doing
[3078.86 → 3088.14] what you do rock on to you too um and I think that pretty much wraps oh this is a good question okay
[3088.14 → 3094.30] last topic of the day and this was actually suggested here by none I wonder what would happen
[3095.02 → 3102.30] if you used the CPU's integrated heat spreader as a water block so basically just drill two holes
[3102.30 → 3109.42] and solder copper pipes onto it okay so a couple problems here um problem number UNO you would have
[3109.42 → 3118.30] to have some way of um like protecting the rest of the CPU from the water which will inevitably pick
[3118.30 → 3124.62] up some ions that will make it conductive and then obviously that's going to be a pretty bad scene um
[3125.66 → 3130.54] problem number the second as far as I know most IHS's are not fully sealed so you would have to make
[3130.54 → 3135.90] sure that you actually complete the seal and do a good job there um problem number the next is they're
[3135.90 → 3142.06] quite small and so actually getting um like large enough barbs that you'd be able to get the kind of
[3142.06 → 3149.10] flow rate that you want for the first for optimal cooling would be a little bit difficult um number
[3149.66 → 3155.90] problem number the next is that having the dye soldered or liquid metalled to an IHS
[3156.46 → 3163.18] probably increases your surface area helping with cooling more than the benefits of having
[3163.90 → 3169.50] um the water directly touching the dye would help I guess is what I'm trying to say so having this
[3169.50 → 3174.70] bigger area where you've got a slight um barrier that you have to pass through versus having a very
[3174.70 → 3182.94] small area I suspect they probably like thought of that at some point um, but it seems like the kind of
[3182.94 → 3186.46] thing that we'd be crazy enough to try so I'm not saying we're never going to do it
[3188.86 → 3195.34] cool suggestion someone said um sorry wizard Mon said 100 fords start firing crashes and not a
[3195.34 → 3200.86] single person cares one tesla hits a barrier at high speeds braining an ankle of the driver and the car
[3200.86 → 3206.86] slowly starts on fire as he limps away national TV newspapers talk shows reblogged 12 million times
[3206.86 → 3211.34] this argument has been brought up many times um
[3213.42 → 3216.62] personally I don't think it's a valid enough reason to take rights away from consumers
[3217.82 → 3222.78] and I think we can end the show right there cool have a good one thanks for watching
