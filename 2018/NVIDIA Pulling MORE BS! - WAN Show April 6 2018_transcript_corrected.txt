[0.00 → 0.32] Here we go.
[3.92 → 6.38] We're live! It's WAN Showtime!
[6.90 → 11.08] Luke is at PAX in Boston. Thank you for asking.
[11.90 → 12.66] James is here.
[12.84 → 13.38] James is here.
[13.90 → 17.04] Yay! New Luke!
[17.64 → 19.78] Discount Luke. Discount Luke.
[19.84 → 20.54] Said everyone.
[21.64 → 23.08] Sorry we're late, you guys.
[23.30 → 28.90] I have to confess that it was not entirely my fault.
[28.90 → 31.64] James was at least partially to blame.
[32.60 → 33.56] Go on.
[34.42 → 38.56] Well, James distracted me with his marvellous beard.
[39.16 → 44.54] I spent 25 minutes just staring at it today rather than working,
[45.04 → 48.12] which happens to be exactly the amount of time that I'm late.
[48.46 → 50.18] Yvonne looks confused and worried.
[52.24 → 55.92] Well, she shouldn't be confused, but she can be a little worried if she'd like.
[55.92 → 59.20] She knows by now.
[59.20 → 64.94] In all seriousness, guys, we have got...
[65.64 → 71.38] Oh, apparently the left ear is not getting the right amount of attention.
[72.12 → 72.94] Oh, crap.
[73.46 → 76.12] I legitimately don't know how to fix that.
[77.82 → 79.38] Put your headphones in mono.
[79.38 → 82.96] Yeah, that may actually be the solution,
[83.78 → 86.52] because I don't remember which dial does what.
[89.92 → 90.48] Yeah.
[91.36 → 91.92] Okay.
[92.92 → 93.50] So, yep.
[93.70 → 93.94] Nope.
[94.84 → 96.80] I don't actually know how that stuff works.
[97.38 → 98.16] So there you go.
[99.30 → 100.86] Apparently left...
[100.86 → 102.34] Why do people change these things?
[102.70 → 104.16] Why would anyone change that?
[104.16 → 107.74] Once again, we didn't touch it all week.
[107.86 → 109.48] And once again, it's different.
[109.76 → 110.12] Gremlins.
[110.30 → 111.80] I swear there are gremlins living in it.
[111.86 → 117.68] So what's actually going on is I have been in a mad sprint to get a bunch of stuff done,
[117.78 → 120.18] because I am going to China.
[121.50 → 124.68] I will be gone all next week, but there will still be videos,
[125.12 → 127.92] because this week, instead of being on time for WAN show,
[128.12 → 129.90] I was shooting two videos.
[130.30 → 131.72] One's actually pretty cool.
[131.72 → 133.78] The other one's garbage.
[134.00 → 136.82] Yeah, the other one's kind of lame.
[137.74 → 143.52] Yeah, no, one of them, Intel released an entire lineup called Leon W,
[143.96 → 146.30] that as far as we could tell,
[146.54 → 148.22] as far as we could tell,
[148.58 → 152.80] is basically their Core Series high-end desktop processors
[152.80 → 157.60] with a Leon sticker over top of Core i9,
[157.60 → 163.22] and some ECC support kind of ticked on in the microcode
[163.22 → 167.90] or with a non-lasered connection somewhere in the chip or something along those lines.
[168.46 → 170.52] At least that's what we thought.
[172.00 → 174.70] And that turned out to be very true.
[175.12 → 176.82] So that's going to be interesting.
[177.04 → 178.40] So you can see what you're paying an extra,
[179.00 → 181.30] as much as like $500, $600 for,
[181.82 → 183.50] depending on what kind of occurrence you use.
[183.50 → 185.80] I'm just mad that that was like a spoiler.
[186.52 → 188.04] Yeah, I guess it's kind of a spoiler.
[188.22 → 188.50] I'm sad.
[188.92 → 192.56] I mean, people who watch the WAN show, we want to spoil them.
[192.78 → 192.94] Nah.
[193.22 → 193.80] They're nice people.
[193.86 → 194.48] They're good people.
[194.54 → 195.10] You do best.
[198.08 → 200.60] Second one is actually on the Lenovo X1 Carbon.
[200.76 → 202.04] Really nice machine.
[202.22 → 202.44] Yeah.
[203.38 → 207.66] But like everything this year, it is not quite perfect,
[207.66 → 210.64] which will drive me to madness at some point
[210.64 → 214.44] because you've got either 1080p with touch
[214.44 → 220.94] or 1440p with HDR, but no touchy.
[222.22 → 225.06] Is there any technical reason for that?
[225.86 → 229.08] Actually, I remember talking to them back at CES,
[229.34 → 231.60] and I managed to get not a marketing person,
[231.72 → 233.24] which is always awesome.
[233.24 → 236.70] When you manage to find the engineering guy
[236.70 → 241.74] that's kind of like back at the back of the booth
[241.74 → 244.46] or kind of sipping a coffee.
[244.68 → 245.86] They don't let me talk to people.
[246.10 → 247.62] Like, yeah, I'm here,
[247.84 → 251.12] but realistically, I'm not really supposed to say anything.
[253.50 → 254.66] You know, whatever.
[254.76 → 255.88] So you go find that guy,
[256.16 → 256.86] and he'll be like,
[256.86 → 260.50] you know, yeah, I wanted that too,
[260.64 → 265.36] but there was some issue with this,
[265.36 → 267.28] and I don't remember what the reason was.
[267.52 → 270.54] It seemed to be a fairly good one.
[271.76 → 273.92] And anyway, we actually had a great chat.
[274.00 → 275.34] But you remember a technical reason.
[275.40 → 277.30] It wasn't just they were trying to hit a particular price point.
[277.44 → 278.80] There was a business reason.
[278.94 → 279.16] Okay.
[279.24 → 281.12] There was a compelling enough reason.
[281.12 → 283.20] Because I remember we had a long chat
[283.20 → 286.76] where we were discussing sort of the stagnation
[286.76 → 290.12] of display technology in the PC space.
[290.44 → 293.44] No one does anything until Apple does it.
[294.26 → 295.16] Because you think about it.
[295.66 → 298.44] A PC up to the very high end
[298.44 → 302.10] would be like 1366 by 768.
[302.18 → 305.86] You remember that horrible sort of HD resolution
[305.86 → 307.36] that they were pushing for a while?
[308.76 → 310.18] Freaking awful.
[310.18 → 311.86] And that was like the norm
[311.86 → 313.78] until Apple came out
[313.78 → 315.78] and was like, okay, no, Retina.
[316.56 → 317.50] Retina's a thing now.
[317.58 → 319.74] And then everyone raced to Retina.
[320.30 → 323.08] But it all feels kind of like
[323.08 → 326.50] it's driven by just responsiveness
[326.50 → 330.40] rather than trying to innovate
[330.40 → 331.88] in a way that's meaningful to the consumer.
[332.22 → 334.52] So I would look at notebook displays,
[334.58 → 335.10] and I would go,
[335.76 → 338.36] why are we trying to sell 4K?
[338.36 → 341.90] Why aren't we just running a sensible resolution
[341.90 → 343.72] like 2560 by 1440
[343.72 → 345.90] and doing it at a higher refresh rate?
[346.40 → 347.66] That's what I'd like to see.
[347.80 → 351.22] I don't mind seeing features like HDR, for example,
[351.46 → 355.46] but I don't necessarily want to compromise on them.
[355.46 → 359.46] So, yeah.
[359.92 → 363.96] To be clear, we are trying to fix the audio,
[364.20 → 366.72] but for now, what I would recommend
[366.72 → 368.58] is that you use the
[368.58 → 371.40] I'm watching a podcast,
[371.84 → 373.40] but my kids are in the next room,
[373.46 → 375.24] and I need to hear if they're crying technique.
[375.78 → 377.52] I can't do one headphone.
[377.82 → 378.18] Really?
[378.18 → 378.96] I can't do it.
[379.20 → 379.70] I don't know.
[379.90 → 380.30] Psychological.
[380.30 → 381.06] It falls out?
[381.32 → 381.96] No, no, no, no, no.
[381.98 → 383.34] It's just the sound of it.
[384.06 → 386.78] I think I'm focusing on the fact
[386.78 → 389.58] that one of my ears is getting worn out
[389.58 → 390.46] faster than the other,
[390.84 → 392.06] and I need them to be balanced.
[393.62 → 394.02] What?
[395.74 → 396.86] That's insane.
[396.86 → 400.42] I'll concede it could be insane.
[401.02 → 401.92] It just bugs me.
[402.50 → 403.58] So, Anne, okay,
[403.78 → 407.10] let's say that I do subscribe to you.
[407.12 → 407.94] Oh, wait, it's too loud.
[408.20 → 408.48] Anthony?
[409.64 → 410.66] Just scream at him.
[410.74 → 411.06] Anthony?
[411.56 → 411.80] Yeah.
[413.00 → 414.62] I'm between a rock and a hard place.
[414.70 → 415.10] No, no, it's fine.
[415.12 → 415.58] I'll message him.
[417.18 → 417.58] Technology.
[418.68 → 419.96] Let's see him walking away.
[421.28 → 423.74] So, let's say that I do subscribe to your theory
[423.74 → 425.16] that listening to headphones
[425.16 → 426.46] is going to wear out my ears.
[427.30 → 431.34] Wouldn't I want to wear them out less?
[433.08 → 433.48] Okay.
[433.92 → 435.36] No, it's not the fact that...
[435.36 → 437.68] So, I would use just one for a bit, right?
[437.80 → 438.18] Right here.
[438.24 → 440.42] Here, I'll show you the technique I came up with.
[440.86 → 443.18] I call it the James is crazy,
[443.30 → 445.76] but maybe just crazy enough for it to work technique.
[446.66 → 447.90] I'm going to listen for a little while here.
[449.40 → 450.66] I'm going to listen for a little while here.
[450.72 → 452.98] I actually miss very little of my program.
[453.94 → 455.94] But you're saving on 50% ear erosion.
[456.74 → 458.56] So, ear erosion.
[459.06 → 459.84] Okay, here's the thing.
[459.92 → 460.48] It's not...
[460.48 → 461.40] Hold on just a sec.
[461.42 → 462.44] I hate you so much.
[462.90 → 465.78] It's not that they're getting used or worn out,
[465.86 → 466.68] like your brakes on the car.
[466.72 → 467.18] That's fine.
[467.26 → 469.12] It's that they're getting used unequally.
[471.20 → 471.60] Okay.
[471.82 → 472.20] All right.
[472.26 → 472.60] All right.
[472.64 → 472.96] All right.
[473.38 → 473.48] All right.
[473.48 → 473.60] All right.
[473.60 → 474.62] But this is all...
[474.62 → 479.44] This was just like the seed that resulted in me just hating the feeling of it now.
[479.62 → 479.92] Right.
[480.02 → 481.28] This is like when I was like 12 or something.
[481.60 → 481.90] Right.
[485.10 → 485.92] Oh, man.
[486.40 → 487.58] Luke, even...
[487.58 → 488.72] He knew I wouldn't check,
[488.72 → 492.60] so he went out of his way to message me and tell me,
[492.74 → 494.86] make sure that you change the title of the WAN show
[494.86 → 497.30] because I'm changing it for the thing that I'm doing at PAX.
[498.52 → 502.74] Oh, Fridays.
[504.42 → 505.14] 17.
[505.14 → 505.26] 17.
[506.26 → 506.66] 17.
[507.84 → 509.30] Can we talk about news while you do that?
[510.06 → 510.42] What?
[510.48 → 511.32] You want to talk about news?
[511.48 → 516.32] You want the work that you do on this show to actually, like, be for something?
[516.64 → 516.86] Yeah.
[516.98 → 517.28] Sometimes.
[517.30 → 517.90] No, that's madness.
[518.80 → 519.62] Yeah, fine.
[519.84 → 520.06] Okay.
[520.14 → 521.00] What do you want to talk about?
[521.00 → 528.56] There's a thread on our forum posted by Aluminum Tech, also known as Aluminum Tech.
[529.52 → 532.12] And this thread is about the Facebook Messenger app
[532.12 → 537.82] and how Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook, this week confirmed that Facebook does indeed
[537.82 → 540.74] scan your messages, whether they're pictures or text or whatever,
[542.44 → 545.38] make sure that they conform with community guidelines
[545.38 → 549.60] before actually sending it to the recipient.
[549.60 → 553.02] So if you send something that's against their guidelines,
[553.20 → 555.82] like hate speech or inciting genocide or something like that,
[555.94 → 558.98] they may not actually deliver that message to whoever you're talking to,
[559.28 → 561.26] which definitely has some benefits.
[562.12 → 570.24] But the thread on our forum kind of erroneously implies that we're not just talking about
[570.24 → 574.92] Facebook Messenger's normal messaging when we're talking about this surveillance.
[575.20 → 577.80] It implies that we're talking about Facebook's secret function,
[577.92 → 582.00] which is more akin to apps like Signal or Telegram.
[582.40 → 583.56] And that's actually not the case.
[583.68 → 585.04] Facebook does have a function.
[585.04 → 590.38] Facebook Messenger has a function where you can make your chats encrypted end-to-end.
[590.62 → 593.00] And the interface turns black and there's a little lock.
[593.34 → 596.18] And you can even make exploding messages like Snapchat style.
[597.20 → 601.14] Facebook is not scanning those messages at all.
[601.64 → 603.44] Or maybe they are, and we have no evidence of it.
[603.48 → 608.32] But the news or whatever Zuckerberg confirmed has nothing to do with the secret messages.
[608.44 → 610.72] It has to do with the normal messages.
[610.72 → 614.34] And so we really shouldn't be surprised that they're looking at those.
[614.86 → 617.06] So tell me then.
[618.64 → 620.40] Okay, do you use Facebook Messenger?
[620.72 → 622.56] Yeah, actually, it's one of my primary messaging apps.
[622.76 → 627.80] Okay, how do you feel about them scanning your messages with an automated system
[627.80 → 633.34] for community guidelines standards adherence?
[633.34 → 636.64] As opposed to like a human?
[636.88 → 639.16] Well, I guess I'm asking two questions first.
[639.40 → 642.56] So do you like or dislike it?
[643.84 → 645.80] Okay, first, I think we should clarify.
[646.04 → 648.44] I believe that they're scanned with an automated system.
[648.56 → 652.04] And once they're flagged, it requires a human to then say,
[652.20 → 653.68] this message is not getting sent through.
[653.82 → 655.08] I believe that's how it works.
[655.18 → 655.40] Sure.
[656.48 → 658.76] I am fine with my messages being scanned.
[659.32 → 659.72] Okay.
[660.42 → 662.38] And are you surprised by this?
[662.66 → 663.02] No.
[663.02 → 663.50] No.
[663.86 → 666.76] Should also mention that they do not use the data that they,
[667.00 → 669.04] any of the information that they scan,
[669.50 → 671.56] that information is not used to sell ads,
[671.76 → 675.00] which is what Gmail used to do prior to last year.
[675.60 → 676.16] Right.
[679.74 → 683.94] So I got to tell you, I, so, okay.
[684.86 → 685.92] Okay, story time.
[685.92 → 692.58] So the only reason that I use Facebook is that Facebook does not
[692.58 → 697.14] permit you to manage a Facebook page.
[697.14 → 702.44] So the first page that I had to manage and the reason that I had to create a Facebook account
[702.44 → 706.30] was the one for NCI PC back when I worked there.
[706.30 → 710.04] So we were trying to get into this whole new fangled social media thing.
[710.04 → 718.00] And so I needed an account so that the page could invite me to manage it and make posts on it and stuff.
[718.00 → 725.48] I have probably posted of my own volition a grand total of, I don't know, between five and ten things on Facebook ever.
[725.48 → 738.32] I only use Facebook Messenger as sort of digital phone book because the good thing about Facebook is that whether, you know,
[738.32 → 746.46] whether you're happy about it or whether you kind of just do it because you have to, pretty much everyone has it.
[746.78 → 754.34] And, yes, thank you, whoever's in the Twitch chat declaring that they do not have Facebook because they're taking some stand.
[755.22 → 756.00] Good for you.
[756.10 → 756.68] We're all jealous.
[756.84 → 757.74] We all want to be in your shoes.
[757.98 → 762.74] Yeah, but the truth of the matter is that Facebook is a great way to get in touch with people.
[762.74 → 769.18] And aside from people changing their names, like, yeah.
[771.68 → 772.08] Okay.
[772.50 → 774.76] Like having your first name and middle name as your Facebook name?
[774.78 → 775.30] No, no.
[775.40 → 776.72] I mean people getting married.
[777.10 → 777.44] Oh, okay.
[777.48 → 784.28] So this is kind of embarrassing, but I was going through my friends on Facebook, and I was like, who are these people?
[786.48 → 788.44] And the people, shut up.
[788.44 → 796.04] The people I was confused about were mostly women from my high school class that are now married.
[796.46 → 801.34] And I was like, that kind of looks all, oh, okay.
[802.10 → 804.00] That makes sense.
[804.68 → 813.12] And then, like, a kid that I went to elementary school with, he changed his name from, like, his stepdad's name,
[813.12 → 818.82] which was his last name for some reason, I'm not quite sure how that worked, to his birth father's name.
[819.22 → 819.24] Oh.
[819.42 → 823.32] So I was like, oh, you're, whatever your name is, Barry now.
[824.86 → 825.54] That's cool.
[825.78 → 827.18] Wouldn't have known that if I hadn't already had your platform.
[827.18 → 827.78] From Barry to Barry?
[828.04 → 828.88] V-E to B-A?
[829.92 → 830.32] No.
[830.76 → 831.54] That would be tough.
[831.64 → 836.04] But anyway, so what's good about Facebook is that it's a digital phone book.
[836.24 → 838.18] It's, because real phone books aren't a thing anymore.
[838.18 → 843.46] But the bad thing about it, and the thing that has always made me both a little bit uncomfortable
[843.46 → 848.08] and just feel like it's a little bit unnecessary, is that while I am technically a millennial,
[848.64 → 854.48] I share sort of updates about my life as a job.
[854.84 → 857.12] I have never done it for leisure, not once.
[857.70 → 860.84] When I created a Facebook account, it was because I needed to for work.
[860.90 → 863.52] When I created a Twitter account, it was because I had to for work.
[863.52 → 867.34] And when I created a YouTube account, it was because I had to for work.
[867.34 → 868.50] Same with Twitch, for that matter.
[870.54 → 873.48] So I just straighten up, like, don't really get it.
[873.88 → 878.12] And I've never really felt, it's never been because I feel super comfortable with it
[878.12 → 880.06] that I've shared a lot of detail about my life.
[880.50 → 886.20] Like, some of you have probably noticed that I, now that, especially now that the Linus
[886.20 → 892.68] Tech Twitter account is managed by the entire team, I post almost nothing really personal
[892.68 → 893.14] on it.
[893.36 → 898.14] And I only post to my personal account, like, once every couple weeks at most.
[898.90 → 901.88] And I've had a lot of people ask me, like, why don't you do more videos on your Linus Cat
[901.88 → 902.36] Tips channel?
[902.50 → 903.38] Or why don't you vlog?
[903.46 → 904.56] Or why don't you do this or do that?
[904.60 → 910.38] And the truth of the matter is, like, I actually, I like not having to talk to anybody when I
[910.38 → 910.80] go home.
[911.10 → 911.66] Yeah, no kidding.
[912.16 → 913.24] Like, it's related.
[913.44 → 918.56] I found that I watched, started watching our videos a lot less once I worked here for
[918.56 → 918.90] a while.
[920.46 → 921.66] And it's, like, not a surprise.
[921.78 → 923.54] Like, what do you want to do when you go home?
[923.60 → 924.68] Do you want to watch Linus Tech Tips?
[924.84 → 927.30] Like, no, you just did Linus Tech Tips all day.
[927.50 → 930.58] I just had to look at him for the last eight hours.
[931.80 → 936.62] The last thing I want to do is to see him again because he's annoying.
[937.34 → 937.94] Oh, it's not you.
[937.94 → 940.32] See how I'm only wearing out one ear right now?
[940.88 → 941.52] It's not you.
[941.62 → 941.94] It's me.
[943.32 → 943.78] It's weird.
[943.86 → 947.96] Today, someone made a thread about an item that they thought would be awesome for us
[947.96 → 948.34] to review.
[948.66 → 949.56] So I sent it to Anthony.
[949.64 → 950.54] I was like, oh, have you seen this yet?
[950.70 → 953.30] And he's like, yeah, Alex just made a video about that today.
[953.44 → 954.50] Like, it's done already.
[955.24 → 955.98] Like, oh.
[958.40 → 959.64] So, okay.
[959.78 → 960.90] So back to Messenger.
[961.14 → 965.08] So for me, honestly, it doesn't affect me much because even though I do have a Facebook
[965.08 → 965.42] account.
[965.52 → 966.52] This is actually, okay.
[966.52 → 968.66] You know, I'm going to go off on another thing here.
[970.22 → 971.00] The not...
[971.00 → 973.00] Use your words.
[973.42 → 980.36] If I had a dollar for every time we've run a giveaway or a promotion or something and
[980.36 → 983.24] it has required you to tweet something.
[983.24 → 990.58] For every time someone's been like, yeah, well, you guys suck because I don't have Twitter.
[991.58 → 999.06] If I had a dollar for every time I saw that, I would still be mad because it's phenomenally
[999.06 → 999.46] stupid.
[1000.52 → 1001.70] Twitter is free.
[1002.30 → 1003.46] Facebook is free.
[1003.46 → 1008.08] And the only information they have is what you give them.
[1008.94 → 1016.24] Creating a Twitter account that's sole purpose is to enter giveaways really doesn't give them
[1016.24 → 1016.96] a lot on you.
[1017.68 → 1019.08] And get this.
[1019.34 → 1020.08] It's free.
[1020.48 → 1022.94] You could create a new one every time.
[1022.94 → 1027.34] Hey, but you need to have an email address which is free to me.
[1027.36 → 1028.08] Also free.
[1028.78 → 1039.38] So if you don't want it that bad to create a free anonymous email and a free anonymous Twitter
[1039.38 → 1041.48] account, people are like, uh, cookies?
[1042.62 → 1043.54] Walk in once.
[1044.38 → 1045.28] Post the thing.
[1046.12 → 1046.94] Log back out.
[1050.00 → 1051.26] It's pet peeve show.
[1051.40 → 1052.64] Next pet peeve topic.
[1052.82 → 1053.26] How about that?
[1053.40 → 1054.18] So, so I do.
[1054.28 → 1059.32] So, so anyway, so I do have a Facebook account, but they actually probably know very, very little
[1059.32 → 1060.14] about me personally.
[1060.14 → 1063.96] Other than that, I'm a tech head and I post a lot of techie stuff for work.
[1063.96 → 1071.44] Um, so I guess I'm trying to say that I just am not bothered that much.
[1071.52 → 1076.54] You know what sucks more about Facebook Messenger than that feature is them putting ads in your
[1076.54 → 1077.00] inbox.
[1077.86 → 1081.74] You probably haven't even seen this, but on mobile, like you'll open your messages.
[1082.04 → 1088.70] It'll be like your partner, your best friend, your acquaintance, Oculus, blah, blah, blah,
[1088.78 → 1089.78] with a picture and everything.
[1090.08 → 1090.14] Really?
[1090.26 → 1093.80] And then another acquaintance straight up like right in there.
[1093.96 → 1097.52] And I don't know if these are in WhatsApp yet, but I wouldn't be surprised if that happens
[1097.52 → 1101.64] soon since they've been wanting to monetize WhatsApp for a while, and they own it.
[1102.74 → 1106.86] Um, I would like to show you something super, super cool and funny.
[1107.34 → 1114.22] Um, I think there's a way to see your page as though you are like, oh man.
[1114.32 → 1116.54] No, you might not your personal page.
[1116.56 → 1116.66] Yeah.
[1116.72 → 1117.56] View as a page visitor.
[1117.56 → 1118.18] No, no, no.
[1118.22 → 1119.66] The line of the line is tech tips one.
[1120.04 → 1120.16] Right.
[1120.44 → 1123.08] Um, oh wow.
[1123.12 → 1123.80] Is it gone?
[1123.96 → 1126.22] Oh, that's pretty annoying.
[1126.62 → 1133.54] Um, well anyway, up until sometime, hopefully fairly recently, the, the line is tech tips
[1133.54 → 1137.96] page actually had as like, like the top post, like somewhere near the top.
[1138.40 → 1141.20] Um, please don't send messages to this account.
[1141.66 → 1142.86] Nobody checks them.
[1142.86 → 1149.90] And right now, see, I don't even know where to find them, which is super terrible.
[1150.58 → 1151.76] Uh, see the feed.
[1151.88 → 1153.54] Do you know where you find messages?
[1153.72 → 1154.76] Maybe you disabled it.
[1154.82 → 1156.96] Maybe that's why that, uh, warning isn't even there anymore.
[1156.96 → 1158.74] I don't know.
[1158.74 → 1160.66] We had something horrendous.
[1160.78 → 1166.32] Like, uh, I don't remember how many tens of thousands of messages that people sent.
[1166.32 → 1169.00] And I was just like, I don't know.
[1169.00 → 1173.46] I don't know what I can do for you to help make it more clear that you shouldn't send
[1173.46 → 1174.44] messages through here.
[1175.00 → 1178.32] Um, and it just said something like, yeah, you need to go on the you need to go on the
[1178.32 → 1181.46] Twitter page if you want to, or the Twitter account, if you need to send a message.
[1181.46 → 1187.96] Um, and I, wow, I just, I have no, I should, I should, honestly, I should be screen sharing
[1187.96 → 1190.20] right now because you guys would find this pretty funny.
[1190.52 → 1192.50] I have no idea how to use Facebook.
[1192.90 → 1194.02] How do I Facebook?
[1194.78 → 1198.36] You may, maybe you used to, and then as soon as you had a kid, it just left you.
[1198.60 → 1199.42] Now you're old people.
[1199.48 → 1200.04] I just never did.
[1200.10 → 1202.12] I just actually never cared, like at all.
[1203.12 → 1205.36] Um, yeah, I don't know.
[1205.42 → 1209.84] But anyway, so the point is I do use Messenger, but it's usually just to be like, oh yeah, that
[1209.84 → 1213.18] person that I met at like badminton at the rec centre a couple of weeks ago.
[1213.80 → 1215.18] Uh, what was their name again?
[1215.30 → 1215.72] Oh, right.
[1215.82 → 1217.14] Maybe I'll see if I can get in touch with them.
[1217.72 → 1217.96] Yeah.
[1218.62 → 1223.88] One Facebook Messenger feature I like is that you can make it your default SMS app on Android
[1223.88 → 1224.20] anyway.
[1224.42 → 1228.94] So you could type in someone's name and then choose to message them via Facebook or through
[1228.94 → 1233.22] like regular texting, which is sweet because then you only have one app for both purposes.
[1234.02 → 1235.24] But it also kind of sucks.
[1235.42 → 1237.12] So I eventually switched back to not doing that.
[1238.08 → 1238.88] All right.
[1238.88 → 1242.34] So why don't we jump into the next thing that I'm super mad about?
[1242.84 → 1247.68] Um, the original article here is from Nantes and this was posted by Aluminum Tech on the
[1247.68 → 1248.00] forum.
[1248.62 → 1249.34] Once again.
[1251.04 → 1251.72] All right.
[1253.96 → 1256.88] This is really dumb and really frustrating.
[1257.10 → 1260.94] And it's not the first time that this has been done by either AMD or NVIDIA.
[1261.42 → 1267.22] And so, right, to be clear, even though it's NVIDIA doing it this time, AMD has done it
[1267.22 → 1267.84] in the past.
[1268.22 → 1270.32] Neither of them is getting a free pass here.
[1270.32 → 1274.28] And this behaviour is absolutely 100% unacceptable.
[1274.60 → 1276.74] It's right in the headline.
[1277.02 → 1285.94] NVIDIA quietly rolls out slower, lower TDP GeForce GT 1030 with DDR4 VRAM.
[1285.94 → 1297.30] Now, to be clear, the GT 1030 is not some kind of pillar of gaming cards or anything like that.
[1297.30 → 1302.10] And you wouldn't expect to be running the latest games at the highest settings, at the highest
[1302.10 → 1303.24] resolutions with them.
[1303.24 → 1313.34] But, you would expect that if you bought a GT 1030, that what you got out of the box would
[1313.34 → 1316.36] be similar to someone else's GT 1030.
[1316.60 → 1321.26] And I would make the argument that if you look a little bit closer at these specs here, look
[1321.26 → 1321.58] at this.
[1321.58 → 1328.06] memory that is running at one third of the speed.
[1329.42 → 1329.78] Huh.
[1330.54 → 1331.72] Oh, man.
[1332.00 → 1340.48] Not to mention, at lower base and boost clocks with a completely different memory technology.
[1340.48 → 1344.32] So, we're talking DDR4 versus GDDR5.
[1346.40 → 1350.02] I would make the assumption that that is not what you would expect.
[1350.82 → 1355.30] And that that is going to make some difference to the gaming experience.
[1355.58 → 1361.38] And that if you are buying a dedicated graphics card, you probably care at least somewhat about
[1361.38 → 1362.58] the gaming experience.
[1362.58 → 1367.06] Is it true that these systems, the systems that will be running these low-end cards,
[1367.06 → 1373.66] as discreet as they may be, won't actually be able to really reap the benefits of GDDR5
[1373.66 → 1374.58] anyway?
[1375.24 → 1376.84] So, it's not a huge loss.
[1377.22 → 1377.48] Okay.
[1378.02 → 1385.00] So, you could make the argument that the way that a review site, like us, or an on-tech,
[1385.00 → 1391.92] or whoever else, would typically benchmark a card like this is not necessarily a very real
[1391.92 → 1392.26] world.
[1392.52 → 1396.74] Because what we'll do, and we've taken a lot of flack for this over the years.
[1396.74 → 1399.40] Presumably from people who don't understand why we do it this way.
[1399.68 → 1404.36] But what we'll typically do is we'll take the highest-end processor on the market, and
[1404.36 → 1407.12] we'll throw a GT 1030 on it.
[1408.24 → 1413.50] And then we'll report our results with the GT 1030 compared to some other graphics cards.
[1413.56 → 1415.32] You know, whatever suite of cards we decide to test.
[1415.90 → 1421.28] And the fatal flaw that people feel like they're pointing out for us is that no one would install
[1421.28 → 1425.60] a GT 1030 on a $2,000 7980 XC 18 car extreme edition.
[1427.60 → 1435.96] But the problem is that if we use anything else, we lose track of the difference between
[1435.96 → 1437.32] these graphics cards.
[1437.54 → 1441.82] Because what might happen is the higher-end ones might end up bottlenecked, so it doesn't
[1441.82 → 1448.08] give you a clear idea of the value-per-dollar prospect of each card.
[1448.08 → 1450.38] You're trying to remove the CPU as a variable altogether.
[1450.86 → 1451.18] Yes.
[1451.66 → 1453.64] So it's as fast as possible.
[1457.00 → 1462.92] Now, with that said, it is possible that in the kind of system someone might install
[1462.92 → 1467.28] one of these in, you might not see as much of a difference.
[1467.62 → 1469.80] But I think you would probably see a difference.
[1469.80 → 1475.58] Especially because GPU memory has an impact on the GPU's ability to load in textures, for
[1475.58 → 1475.98] example.
[1476.20 → 1479.30] So it might affect the detail level that you can run at.
[1479.72 → 1482.78] Now, this might be completely naive and ignorant.
[1483.02 → 1488.54] But does the type of memory impact the TDP of the graphics card?
[1488.70 → 1490.12] So it depends.
[1490.18 → 1491.90] It depends on the clock speed it's running at.
[1491.90 → 1493.90] It depends on the...
[1493.90 → 1496.30] I think it...
[1496.30 → 1497.78] Yeah, it depends on how many chips you're running.
[1498.04 → 1499.74] It depends on...
[1499.74 → 1501.44] Yeah, mainly that.
[1501.50 → 1502.10] It depends on the...
[1502.10 → 1503.74] Yeah, it depends on the tech that's being used.
[1504.16 → 1508.82] Because you could also make an argument that it's better to have a lower TDP GPU.
[1509.16 → 1512.96] Like, if you're looking to get a 1030 and the kind of system that's going to run it,
[1513.00 → 1517.42] you might actually want that lower TDP more than you want the extra memory.
[1517.42 → 1520.00] So that is possible.
[1521.76 → 1525.36] But in that case, what I'd like to see is a separate SKU.
[1525.64 → 1530.42] I ended up arguing with Sapphire on the phone about...
[1530.42 → 1532.12] How old was I?
[1532.26 → 1534.56] It was supposed to be about 16 years ago, but I'm still mad.
[1535.04 → 1542.40] I ended up arguing with Sapphire on the phone, and AMD for that matter, about a Radeon 9600
[1542.40 → 1543.22] that I bought.
[1544.00 → 1546.16] So that should give you guys some idea of...
[1546.16 → 1547.42] Well, I told you how long ago it was.
[1547.46 → 1550.16] Anyway, the point is, it was a Radeon 9600.
[1550.70 → 1553.92] And it came with a 64-bit...
[1553.92 → 1555.14] I still remember to this day.
[1555.20 → 1559.78] It came with a 64-bit memory bus instead of a 128-bit bus.
[1560.32 → 1564.92] And back then, that was a big deal.
[1564.92 → 1571.18] And compared to a 1030, a 960 was still sort of a somewhat respectable card.
[1571.54 → 1573.06] Like, if you wanted to play...
[1573.06 → 1577.60] I don't remember if this is sort of era appropriate, but I think, like, Sims would have been the
[1577.60 → 1579.52] kind of thing that my sister might have wanted to run on it.
[1579.98 → 1582.28] That would have made a significant difference.
[1582.28 → 1589.54] And the reason I was mad was that not only was it not marked clearly anywhere on the box what the
[1589.54 → 1595.38] difference in spec was between this card and the other one, the only place anywhere that I could find
[1595.38 → 1599.78] this information was on Sapphire's website, but not their North American one.
[1599.98 → 1601.30] It was on their European one.
[1601.76 → 1602.18] Wow.
[1602.18 → 1609.60] So I had to go all the way out of my own territory online in order to find out that this card was
[1609.60 → 1610.62] not the same thing.
[1610.64 → 1612.90] And it was, like, hidden, like, way down somewhere.
[1613.20 → 1619.74] And this was at a time when manufacturers were often doing, like, SE editions of cards,
[1620.26 → 1622.02] special edition or second edition.
[1622.44 → 1625.96] But what the community nicknamed these things was slow edition because a lot of the time they
[1625.96 → 1627.70] were cut down because of yields.
[1628.20 → 1630.70] So, like, they had a bunch of scrap chips that they had to do something with.
[1630.70 → 1634.82] So they'd, like, you know, cut down the memory bus, or they'd do something else like that.
[1635.72 → 1637.84] And that's a point that people are bringing up this time.
[1638.06 → 1641.14] You know, what's the difference between this and, like, 1080 Ti?
[1641.86 → 1642.88] It's just...
[1642.88 → 1647.54] But the thing is, they don't put these other letters, these qualifiers, front and centre
[1647.54 → 1648.78] on the box in this case.
[1649.02 → 1649.20] No.
[1649.30 → 1651.16] This is way down the line in the product description.
[1651.16 → 1653.50] It's a description of the memory.
[1653.68 → 1655.48] It's not up front right beside the 1080.
[1656.02 → 1660.14] They do put D4 in the description, but it's not a 1080 D4.
[1660.14 → 1662.32] It's way, way, way, way down there.
[1662.76 → 1664.50] So I find it really frustrating.
[1664.84 → 1671.62] But NVIDIA seems to be, rather than having taken our feedback and a lot of other members
[1671.62 → 1679.00] of the press feedback to heart about the 1060 3GB, which is more than just a 1060 with 3GB of RAM,
[1679.06 → 1679.94] or I should say less.
[1680.12 → 1681.90] It's actually slower as well.
[1681.90 → 1687.46] They seem to have taken all the feedback that we gave them and crumpled it up and thrown
[1687.46 → 1690.82] it in a fire because here they are doing it again, and it's only been a few months.
[1691.14 → 1695.88] So what I worry about is that if we don't call them out on this, it's going to be something
[1695.88 → 1697.90] that we're going to continue to see happen.
[1697.90 → 1700.56] And that's not what we need.
[1700.82 → 1702.36] You don't want to have to walk...
[1702.36 → 1709.80] Remember, guys, this is the same company that brought you Greenlight, that brought you a
[1709.80 → 1715.04] program that restricted their partner's abilities to pre-overclock their cards to differentiate
[1715.04 → 1715.58] them.
[1717.34 → 1718.72] Supposedly to reduce confusion.
[1718.86 → 1721.36] That's why they have all these branding initiatives and stuff like that.
[1722.26 → 1724.40] Oh, not to mention GeForce Partner Program.
[1724.46 → 1725.54] We want to reduce confusion.
[1725.54 → 1730.10] Do you want to reduce confusion or do you just want the right type of confusion?
[1730.66 → 1732.68] So it's good for their business interests.
[1732.80 → 1733.64] So it does matter.
[1734.04 → 1736.16] A lot of people won't notice anyway or won't know.
[1736.48 → 1738.88] So just let it kind of slip by.
[1740.60 → 1741.38] This is great.
[1742.52 → 1745.42] Sparkleman55 says, rip, I got the notification a half hour late.
[1745.68 → 1747.30] No, no, we were just a half hour late.
[1748.58 → 1750.00] Unless you just got it now.
[1751.20 → 1752.36] Yeah, we're the ones ripped.
[1752.36 → 1757.14] So I guess I don't really have a ton more to add.
[1757.58 → 1759.22] I mean, this is really frustrating.
[1759.46 → 1760.60] You've got a note in here.
[1760.66 → 1763.34] Some of the listed documentation does show two different core names.
[1763.74 → 1766.42] GP108300 versus GP108310.
[1768.00 → 1769.86] But the whole thing is very confusing.
[1769.86 → 1774.62] Oh, this was what I ended up yelling at AMD about 16 years ago.
[1775.18 → 1777.26] AMD on their website.
[1777.66 → 1780.44] Because remember, this was not an AMD card technically.
[1780.56 → 1781.82] It was a Sapphire card.
[1782.36 → 1784.38] As if AMD didn't send them the frigging chips.
[1785.08 → 1790.80] AMD's own website had no mention whatsoever of a 64-bit memory bus variant of this card.
[1790.80 → 1793.42] So in this case, once again...
[1793.42 → 1794.54] Just washing their hands of it.
[1794.72 → 1800.30] The official NVIDIA GeForce GT 1030 product page mentions nothing about this change.
[1800.30 → 1812.94] So how can you advocate for less consumer confusion when you're running around enabling your partners to release products,
[1813.00 → 1816.08] even if you're technically not your product or whatever the defence would be?
[1816.42 → 1822.02] How can you be running around enabling partners to create products based on your products that you don't even list on your website?
[1822.02 → 1826.82] Especially going forward when those partners are part of the GeForce partner program.
[1826.82 → 1832.30] Very, very frustrating.
[1833.22 → 1833.80] Alright.
[1834.34 → 1837.08] Do you also feel passionately about this Spectre business?
[1837.88 → 1841.04] I can't imagine that you feel as passionate about it.
[1843.12 → 1848.96] What I really feel passionate about is eating Savage Jerky.
[1848.96 → 1850.40] I knew...
[1850.40 → 1854.52] In my head I was like, he wouldn't.
[1855.26 → 1856.24] He couldn't.
[1856.82 → 1857.70] God damn it.
[1857.70 → 1858.38] He did.
[1859.66 → 1865.04] Savage Jerky is a tasty snack that's not bad for you.
[1865.10 → 1867.72] It's made with the best ingredients without nitrates or preservatives.
[1868.16 → 1872.74] And their goal was to, well, create a snack that's full of flavour and not bad for you.
[1873.04 → 1874.30] Which I think I already said.
[1874.46 → 1875.98] I got my talking points mixed up here.
[1876.30 → 1878.24] They've got 13 different flavours of jerky.
[1878.72 → 1881.24] Some of the fan favourites are the sriracha bacon.
[1881.24 → 1884.22] My personal favourite is the maple buffalo bacon.
[1884.50 → 1887.66] I gave it to someone else to try like two weeks ago, and they were like, eh.
[1888.04 → 1888.58] But whatever.
[1888.72 → 1889.20] I like it.
[1889.26 → 1889.46] I don't care what they think.
[1889.46 → 1890.32] More for you, man.
[1890.42 → 1890.98] More for me.
[1891.04 → 1891.80] There's probably John.
[1892.22 → 1892.88] He's not Canadian.
[1893.02 → 1893.64] Not that I was gonna...
[1893.64 → 1894.38] Doesn't understand maple.
[1894.58 → 1896.26] Not that I was going to share it with anybody anyway.
[1896.48 → 1897.38] So whatever.
[1897.38 → 1900.64] The cracked pepper and sea salt is perfect.
[1900.72 → 1901.84] The traditional is perfect.
[1902.02 → 1904.08] The anything Moho is perfect.
[1904.46 → 1905.16] Can you hand me a bag?
[1906.48 → 1907.24] You're a vegetarian.
[1907.24 → 1908.98] I want to check out the label and stuff.
[1909.14 → 1909.28] Oh.
[1910.16 → 1911.94] And why not show off a different flavour?
[1912.08 → 1912.34] Fine.
[1912.42 → 1913.76] You can show off whatever flavour you want.
[1913.86 → 1914.60] You can have a little box.
[1915.32 → 1917.52] So they not only make jerky.
[1917.62 → 1920.48] They've got hot sauces, barbecue sauces, a spice rub.
[1921.16 → 1921.56] Jacked.
[1921.72 → 1922.46] I never get any.
[1923.30 → 1924.88] You're not supposed to get any.
[1924.88 → 1927.34] Well, this bag's...
[1927.34 → 1927.44] Fine.
[1927.52 → 1927.86] Take it.
[1927.90 → 1928.34] Take it.
[1928.34 → 1929.68] This bag's been open for over a week.
[1929.92 → 1932.00] But you don't get to complain when I take your M&Ms anymore.
[1932.38 → 1933.06] I don't.
[1933.40 → 1933.76] Well...
[1933.76 → 1934.98] It's just that you do it all the time.
[1935.24 → 1935.50] Okay.
[1935.76 → 1937.00] Actually, I don't eat M&Ms anymore.
[1937.12 → 1937.66] I eat trail mix.
[1937.74 → 1938.72] You take that all the time.
[1938.86 → 1941.92] Yeah, but you don't get to complain when I pick the M&Ms out of your trail mix.
[1942.42 → 1943.76] I think he's pretty generous.
[1943.98 → 1945.80] He's given me M&Ms without me even asking before.
[1946.80 → 1950.64] So use offer code LTT to save 10% on Savage Jerky Products.
[1950.64 → 1957.38] Next up, we've got Honey.
[1958.38 → 1963.86] So when you shop online, are you the kind of person who suddenly turns into a tab hoarder?
[1964.64 → 1965.48] Yeah, turns into.
[1965.60 → 1965.74] Sure.
[1967.50 → 1969.24] Loading dozens and dozens of new tabs.
[1969.40 → 1971.14] Middle click really is like the bomb.
[1971.60 → 1972.28] What is that?
[1972.62 → 1974.16] Middle click to open in a new tab.
[1974.38 → 1975.54] You mean like click the mouse wheel?
[1975.72 → 1975.94] Yeah.
[1976.34 → 1978.96] Doesn't that just make it like the continuous scrolling thing?
[1979.06 → 1979.24] No.
[1979.24 → 1980.56] What?
[1980.78 → 1981.62] Not when you click a link.
[1982.34 → 1983.64] Oh, you middle-click a link.
[1983.84 → 1984.58] Yeah, you don't know this?
[1984.82 → 1985.62] No, I don't know that.
[1985.70 → 1986.06] It's the best.
[1986.50 → 1988.72] That's how I end up with like 100 tabs open.
[1988.86 → 1989.70] Oh, I really like that.
[1989.74 → 1990.54] You know what I use a lot?
[1991.10 → 1992.10] Control shift T.
[1992.34 → 1992.98] You know what that is?
[1993.60 → 1994.40] That's your next tab.
[1994.82 → 1996.10] Reopen close tab.
[1996.46 → 1997.74] Oh, no, I just never close them.
[1997.88 → 1998.30] That's far better.
[1998.30 → 2006.36] So anyway, one of the reasons you might end up with a bunch of tabs is searching for promo codes.
[2006.96 → 2009.68] Hopefully at least one that actually works.
[2009.68 → 2017.54] And you don't want to close any of them because you might have to go back and, you know, try them again or try them on a different product or whatever the case may be.
[2017.62 → 2019.46] Well, Honey gets rid of all that.
[2019.46 → 2024.72] Honey is the free browser add-on that over 9 million people are using every day to save money while they shop online.
[2025.58 → 2029.86] In two clicks, you can add Honey to any browser for free, then shop like you normally do.
[2030.20 → 2033.92] Honey scans and tests millions of coupons in the background.
[2034.10 → 2037.24] Then at checkout, Honey automatically applies the best coupon.
[2037.56 → 2038.24] I said 9 million.
[2038.34 → 2039.06] I felt like a sucker.
[2039.52 → 2042.02] Time magazine calls Honey basically free money.
[2042.14 → 2042.82] What am I doing?
[2044.56 → 2047.78] So there's basically no reason to not add Honey to your browser.
[2048.10 → 2050.78] It's free, two clicks to install, and we'll save you money.
[2051.02 → 2053.60] So try it out over at honey.com slash Linus.
[2053.60 → 2056.04] And we're going to have that linked in the video description.
[2057.80 → 2059.64] Finally, FreshBooks.
[2060.42 → 2061.62] FreshBooks.
[2061.90 → 2068.06] FreshBooks is the super simple to use invoicing tool that does a lot more than just help you create and send professional looking invoices.
[2068.36 → 2074.08] It helps you track your time with their timesheet function, manage your expenses, and keep track of who owes you what, which is important.
[2074.56 → 2080.86] It also has a feature that tells you when your client has looked at your invoice for the first time so that you can put an end to that whole,
[2081.28 → 2082.84] Hey, did you get that invoice I sent?
[2083.60 → 2086.70] Wow, you're really not going to help me out here.
[2086.76 → 2087.36] This is what they do.
[2087.42 → 2088.60] They stare blankly at you.
[2088.62 → 2089.04] Ah, I see.
[2089.20 → 2090.56] What invoice, Linus?
[2090.64 → 2092.02] I didn't pick up what you're throwing down.
[2092.10 → 2093.92] Anyway, the point is you'll know that they saw it.
[2094.04 → 2098.16] And if you have questions, you can reach out to their support staff where you will speak to a real human.
[2098.68 → 2100.92] No escalations, no return calls, just answers.

[2107.72 → 2109.92] That's freshbooks.com slash when.
[2111.02 → 2111.62] FreshBooks!
[2111.62 → 2115.70] I think you just owned the ears of the viewers.
[2116.38 → 2117.44] Thank you for that.
[2118.10 → 2119.24] I don't have a choice.
[2121.12 → 2121.68] All right.
[2122.00 → 2123.48] What topic do you want to do next?
[2124.56 → 2125.56] Oh my, oh, oh.
[2126.70 → 2127.64] Can we do this one?
[2128.48 → 2128.74] Okay.
[2129.62 → 2130.06] I'm sorry.
[2130.20 → 2132.22] Okay, but the thing is, only part of this is news.
[2133.42 → 2133.86] All right, fine.
[2133.90 → 2135.02] We'll do your stupid PS5 thing.
[2135.08 → 2135.82] Nah, this is good.
[2135.88 → 2136.66] I didn't want to talk about this.
[2136.66 → 2140.42] No, I'm already screen sharing the original article here from express.co.uk.
[2141.00 → 2141.40] PS5.
[2141.64 → 2143.18] Rumours are it might come out this Christmas.
[2143.66 → 2145.28] A lot of people think those rumours are dumb.
[2145.82 → 2150.28] So this started on a website called, what is it called?
[2150.58 → 2152.66] The Situation or...
[2152.66 → 2154.16] We're going to have to stop calling you Laser James.
[2154.16 → 2154.84] Semi-accurate.
[2155.12 → 2157.76] We're going to have to go with Savage James.
[2158.66 → 2160.04] Here, have some Savage Jerky.
[2160.94 → 2161.60] That was Savage.
[2162.44 → 2166.54] Okay, so I actually, this website has a great name in this context.
[2166.66 → 2167.86] Semi-accurate.com.
[2168.12 → 2172.86] Behind a $1,000 per year paywall, or $100 a year for students,
[2173.20 → 2177.52] this website published an article with allegedly legit information
[2177.52 → 2180.80] claiming that the PlayStation 5 was going to come out this holiday season,
[2180.80 → 2183.60] which is a lot sooner than people would think,
[2183.74 → 2186.20] considering that the PS4 Pro came out only two years ago,
[2186.30 → 2189.00] and the PS4 itself only came out five years ago,
[2189.26 → 2194.02] when traditionally the launch cycles of these things have been about seven years,
[2194.08 → 2195.24] between the three and four.
[2195.24 → 2199.34] So people think that you can...
[2199.34 → 2202.52] Sony can make a lot more money off the PS4 Pro still.
[2203.58 → 2207.12] Like, that can become the de facto, like, normal default PlayStation for people,
[2207.16 → 2209.08] and they can start to push the price down to, like, $250.
[2209.54 → 2212.96] They don't need to release the new PlayStation just yet.
[2213.62 → 2216.22] The PS4 Pro was two years ago?
[2216.22 → 2218.54] Yeah, bro.
[2219.32 → 2221.62] See, the older you get, the faster time goes.
[2221.92 → 2222.28] What?
[2223.50 → 2226.60] Because each year of your life is a smaller proportion of your life.
[2226.64 → 2228.18] No, it was a year and a half.
[2230.26 → 2230.62] Okay.
[2231.18 → 2232.58] Oh, okay.
[2232.64 → 2233.84] I should have written the months in.
[2234.32 → 2235.18] Oh, okay.
[2235.44 → 2238.94] No, no, no, but by the time this launched at Christmas, it would be two years.
[2238.94 → 2240.02] Oh, I see your point.
[2240.14 → 2241.04] Okay, okay, okay.
[2241.58 → 2243.04] So here's...
[2244.04 → 2244.36] Okay.
[2244.60 → 2246.72] Do you want to go through the rumoured specs first?
[2247.92 → 2248.30] Sure.
[2248.40 → 2249.62] It's going to be AMD again.
[2249.70 → 2251.70] The platform, like, the architecture is Nazi.
[2251.78 → 2252.76] It's going to be eight cores.
[2252.90 → 2254.82] And I actually have a question about that if we get to it.
[2254.84 → 2254.98] Yeah.
[2254.98 → 2257.44] It's going to have a strong emphasis on VR support.
[2258.60 → 2260.36] That, some discussion there.
[2260.62 → 2265.14] You know, they have to make certain considerations and decisions to include that.
[2265.64 → 2269.34] And maybe no one cares, but maybe no one cares because there's no good VR yet.
[2269.50 → 2271.30] And this is a chicken-and-egg thing.
[2271.40 → 2276.24] They did recently drop the price of the PSVR, but I don't know what's...
[2276.24 → 2281.48] My understanding is that the PSVR is the best-selling gaming VR headset.
[2281.48 → 2288.10] But I also don't know if that's meeting Sony's expectations in terms of how many they have to sell in order to support it.
[2289.32 → 2290.08] It's a...
[2290.08 → 2293.12] I think at this point, it's a rising tide lifts all boats thing with VR.
[2294.14 → 2296.04] It's a setup for future profits.
[2296.56 → 2298.00] What else do we know about this thing?
[2298.26 → 2301.76] We know that the CPU would be rumoured to be Zen-based, although...
[2301.76 → 2307.50] We could pretty much take for granted that any future custom SoC that AMD would produce for,
[2307.50 → 2311.78] whether it's Microsoft or Sony, would hopefully be Zen-based at this point.
[2311.92 → 2314.58] So here's my question, and again, noob question, maybe.
[2316.00 → 2321.84] On the PC, in the realm of PC gaming, prior to Ry zen and Coffee Lake for sure,
[2322.34 → 2328.62] single-threaded, all the games and engines and all that, APIs, are optimized for single-threaded, right?
[2330.06 → 2330.66] So...
[2330.66 → 2331.44] Depends.
[2332.10 → 2332.50] Mostly.
[2334.38 → 2335.72] Strongly, strongly depends.
[2335.72 → 2337.72] So some of them...
[2338.58 → 2343.72] Basically, since we started getting dual cores, which was actually...
[2344.56 → 2344.92] Oh!
[2345.28 → 2346.72] A really long time ago now.
[2347.64 → 2348.92] Which is sort of terrible.
[2349.08 → 2349.72] At least 10 years.
[2349.96 → 2350.52] More than that.
[2350.84 → 2351.26] Yeah, I mean...
[2351.26 → 2352.70] They were in laptops 10 years ago.
[2352.72 → 2353.90] Q-6600.
[2353.98 → 2355.72] I remember buying our...
[2356.72 → 2359.22] Q-6600 engineering sample,
[2359.70 → 2362.56] which technically you're neither supposed to buy nor sell,
[2362.56 → 2367.62] from my old boss at NCI back in 2007.
[2368.38 → 2372.96] So yes, quad-core, and that was a like $600, $700 CPU,
[2373.18 → 2377.74] so that was like the first non-extreme edition quad-core,
[2378.34 → 2380.26] but certainly not mainstream yet.
[2380.42 → 2381.72] Dennis just walked by with an eggplant.
[2381.72 → 2383.72] So we've got...
[2383.72 → 2384.72] What are you...
[2384.72 → 2386.46] Get out of here with that.
[2388.14 → 2392.26] So we've had quad cores on the desktop for 10 years,
[2392.42 → 2394.76] and that chip later dropped in price,
[2394.82 → 2398.98] I think probably about 8 months to 8 to 12 months later,
[2399.06 → 2400.30] and became far more accessible.
[2400.30 → 2403.74] So ever since then,
[2404.06 → 2407.72] we have seen an onward march towards supporting more cores.
[2407.82 → 2408.90] Now, in the early days,
[2409.06 → 2410.48] the support was fairly rudimentary.
[2410.94 → 2414.22] Like, you would have one core dedicated to, like,
[2414.76 → 2416.38] mostly the entire game,
[2416.56 → 2419.42] and then you'd have another one that handled, like,
[2419.52 → 2420.88] maybe enemy AI.
[2421.20 → 2423.56] Like, one thing would be offloaded.
[2423.56 → 2425.42] But over time,
[2425.58 → 2429.08] they got to supporting more and more and more threads natively,
[2429.26 → 2433.02] and I believe Crisis 3 supports something like 4?
[2433.72 → 2436.52] Well, why is it then when Ry zen came out,
[2436.70 → 2438.10] and it had all these cores,
[2438.68 → 2439.96] everyone was stoked on it,
[2440.18 → 2440.90] and in theory,
[2440.98 → 2444.10] the performance should beat a lot of these Intel SKUs,
[2444.70 → 2445.30] it didn't,
[2445.38 → 2447.24] and it was because we had to wait for the game developers
[2447.24 → 2451.20] to optimize their games and the APIs for quality core.
[2451.38 → 2453.20] Okay, so there were a couple of things that happened.
[2453.20 → 2454.26] First,
[2454.82 → 2457.54] a lot of the things that people were excited about with Ry zen,
[2457.62 → 2459.08] and about multicore on Ry zen,
[2459.34 → 2460.98] well, actually, I think it's mainly two things.
[2461.36 → 2462.96] One is that AMD,
[2464.34 → 2466.38] depending on how you look at it,
[2466.94 → 2467.96] and it's complicated,
[2468.20 → 2472.08] but AMD wasn't that far behind Intel for gaming
[2472.08 → 2475.06] from a certain point of view,
[2475.20 → 2476.82] as Obi-Wan might put it,
[2477.26 → 2479.60] because at the resolutions
[2479.60 → 2481.76] that you would be likely to run games at,
[2481.76 → 2483.56] so higher resolution with higher details,
[2483.98 → 2486.22] you'd be more likely to hit a GPU bottleneck
[2486.22 → 2487.10] than a CPU one.
[2487.90 → 2488.86] So in that sense,
[2489.02 → 2491.68] AMD CPUs weren't that far off,
[2492.42 → 2494.86] unless you did want to turn down your details
[2494.86 → 2495.98] to get higher frame rates
[2495.98 → 2497.46] because you were a competitive player,
[2497.46 → 2503.56] or unless you cared about your power consumption
[2503.56 → 2506.36] because they did consume a lot more power before Zen,
[2507.00 → 2510.82] or if you wanted more up-to-date features on the platform
[2510.82 → 2512.06] because by the end of it,
[2512.18 → 2514.70] those boards were looking pretty dated
[2514.70 → 2515.76] in terms of their feature sets,
[2515.80 → 2517.00] so there were lots of other things.
[2517.10 → 2519.38] Let me fully actually finish the question.
[2519.38 → 2521.14] The final clause of the question is,
[2521.74 → 2523.70] given that in the PC side,
[2524.52 → 2528.16] it's so weird that in the console side,
[2528.26 → 2531.38] you've got these multicore AMD chips
[2531.94 → 2534.40] ruling the roost on all the consoles.
[2534.76 → 2537.10] So are game developers
[2537.10 → 2540.10] taking different approaches on console and PC?
[2540.96 → 2541.44] So, okay.
[2542.02 → 2546.18] So, back to your question.
[2546.36 → 2547.60] The things people were excited about.
[2548.20 → 2550.66] AMD having better single-threaded performance for gaming,
[2551.04 → 2553.76] and AMD having multithreaded performance
[2553.76 → 2555.52] for other workloads,
[2555.78 → 2557.62] and also to put pressure on Intel.
[2558.26 → 2559.34] Because that's what Intel did.
[2559.74 → 2560.00] Right.
[2560.10 → 2561.84] They launched quad-core on the desktop
[2561.84 → 2563.60] back in like 2006,
[2564.14 → 2566.30] and it was quad-core on the desktop
[2566.30 → 2569.54] up until 2006.
[2571.06 → 2572.06] That was pretty much it,
[2572.12 → 2574.04] unless you wanted to spring from the high-end desktop platform.
[2574.04 → 2577.24] Well, there were six core AMD CPUs in like 2010.
[2577.24 → 2578.48] No, but I mean on the Intel side.
[2578.56 → 2578.92] Yeah, yeah, okay.
[2578.96 → 2581.20] The thing about those six core AMD processors, though,
[2581.22 → 2582.22] is that they didn't threaten Intel.
[2582.60 → 2583.60] Even with six cores,
[2583.98 → 2586.06] they weren't competitive with Intel's own quad cores
[2586.06 → 2587.10] that they could turn out.
[2587.20 → 2588.38] So it wasn't really relevant,
[2588.46 → 2589.24] and they sucked more power.
[2589.50 → 2590.24] They didn't overclock.
[2590.36 → 2591.30] There were a bunch of things.
[2592.32 → 2593.84] So, people were excited
[2593.84 → 2597.46] because Zen would bring more competition to the market.
[2597.46 → 2600.78] Now, getting back to AMD's previous cores,
[2601.06 → 2604.22] not necessarily being that underpowered for gaming,
[2604.32 → 2606.76] well, that's what you're seeing on the game consoles.
[2607.50 → 2608.84] So because the game developers
[2608.84 → 2611.48] know exactly what hardware they're optimizing for,
[2611.48 → 2612.22] they can go,
[2612.22 → 2614.92] okay, we're going to have exactly this.
[2615.02 → 2615.34] Oh, right.
[2615.38 → 2617.90] The other issue with Zen performance on the desktop and games
[2617.90 → 2620.56] was actually more software and firmware related.
[2620.70 → 2622.48] There were scheduler issues with Windows,
[2623.02 → 2625.60] and there were, I mean, any new CPU.
[2625.86 → 2627.32] It's kind of like why I put,
[2629.62 → 2630.82] what was the
[2630.82 → 2633.68] what was the not set of the 6950Xs
[2633.68 → 2635.12] in the editing machines,
[2635.30 → 2636.50] like three weeks before
[2636.50 → 2638.52] the new 18 core flagship came out.
[2638.52 → 2639.82] The reason is that
[2639.82 → 2641.36] anytime you have a new CPU launch,
[2641.42 → 2642.52] whether it's AMD or Intel,
[2642.62 → 2644.32] and particularly on this last round,
[2644.60 → 2646.34] where both AMD and Intel
[2646.34 → 2648.30] were guilty of pulling up their launches
[2648.30 → 2649.94] just to like,
[2650.00 → 2651.34] just to have something out there
[2651.34 → 2653.90] and them being not quite 100% polished,
[2654.54 → 2656.28] anytime you have a new CPU,
[2656.44 → 2657.96] you're going to have some issues.
[2658.66 → 2661.38] And that was a big part
[2661.38 → 2663.12] of what affected gaming performance on the desktop.
[2663.26 → 2664.48] And sometimes game developers
[2664.48 → 2665.54] did have to optimize
[2665.54 → 2667.14] because even though it's x86,
[2668.20 → 2670.82] it's not like a new CPU
[2670.82 → 2672.82] is just the old CPU,
[2672.98 → 2674.90] but like with a Trogon,
[2675.32 → 2676.08] like arm,
[2676.32 → 2680.22] like it's actually different.
[2681.60 → 2683.04] And so if you gave,
[2683.24 → 2683.88] even if let's say
[2683.88 → 2685.40] you gave a professional driver,
[2686.20 → 2688.84] and I don't know cars,
[2689.14 → 2690.18] but so you'll have to forgive me,
[2690.22 → 2691.42] but let's say you gave them
[2691.42 → 2693.94] a Bugatti and a Lamborghini,
[2694.50 → 2695.62] some model,
[2695.72 → 2696.44] X and Y,
[2696.64 → 2697.28] and you were like,
[2697.36 → 2697.58] okay,
[2697.74 → 2698.92] get the best track time
[2698.92 → 2700.36] on this track.
[2701.40 → 2702.98] It would take them a little while
[2702.98 → 2704.16] if they switched from this one
[2704.16 → 2704.72] to that one
[2704.72 → 2706.12] to learn the best way to do it,
[2706.14 → 2707.40] even if this one was more powerful.
[2708.08 → 2708.86] Like they are,
[2708.98 → 2710.46] they're different machines.
[2711.58 → 2713.54] So coming back to consoles,
[2713.64 → 2714.64] this has been a very sort of
[2714.64 → 2715.70] winding topic here.
[2716.64 → 2717.46] They know exactly
[2717.46 → 2718.50] what they're optimizing for.
[2718.50 → 2720.04] They don't have to make any guesses
[2720.04 → 2722.42] and they are going to
[2722.42 → 2724.58] run the game in such a way
[2724.58 → 2725.34] and they're going to optimize
[2725.34 → 2726.18] the game in such a way
[2726.18 → 2727.02] that you aren't going to run
[2727.02 → 2727.96] out of CPU resources.
[2728.48 → 2730.02] Also, by the end of AMD's
[2730.02 → 2730.84] non-Zen cores,
[2730.98 → 2732.34] while the performance wasn't great,
[2732.46 → 2733.36] their power efficiency
[2733.36 → 2735.00] was getting a lot better.
[2735.82 → 2737.02] So they take this good
[2737.02 → 2737.62] power efficiency
[2737.62 → 2738.42] and they've got four
[2738.42 → 2740.36] kind of like good enough cores
[2740.36 → 2741.84] and they've got developers
[2741.84 → 2743.56] who know that they can split it up
[2743.56 → 2744.76] exactly in this way
[2744.76 → 2745.44] because it's going to run
[2745.44 → 2746.60] on four cores.
[2746.72 → 2747.24] There's not going to be
[2747.24 → 2748.26] some Yahoo out there
[2748.26 → 2749.10] running a dual-core
[2749.10 → 2751.40] because Intel still has
[2751.40 → 2753.56] dual cores for some reason
[2753.56 → 2756.60] and they can split it up
[2756.60 → 2757.20] that way to make
[2757.20 → 2758.24] the best possible use
[2758.24 → 2759.06] of the quad-core.
[2759.56 → 2760.22] And then the GPU.
[2760.50 → 2761.26] Well, they can push
[2761.26 → 2762.40] the game's visual effects
[2762.40 → 2763.10] to the max
[2763.10 → 2764.48] so that they can run
[2764.48 → 2765.50] into a GPU bottleneck
[2765.50 → 2766.52] rather than a CPU one.
[2766.76 → 2767.72] Also, it's a console.
[2767.82 → 2768.68] It's going to run on a TV.
[2768.80 → 2769.40] It doesn't have to run
[2769.40 → 2771.24] higher than 60 FPS anyway.
[2771.54 → 2771.90] Cool.
[2772.00 → 2772.42] I get it now.
[2772.42 → 2773.12] There's the long,
[2773.26 → 2774.58] the very, very long answer.
[2774.72 → 2775.80] Hopefully that wasn't too boring.
[2775.80 → 2776.32] You're bacon.
[2776.50 → 2778.92] You've been talking with your hands
[2778.92 → 2779.70] way too much
[2779.70 → 2782.72] to still be holding that bacon.
[2782.84 → 2783.22] So please,
[2783.60 → 2785.30] now to circle all the way back
[2785.30 → 2785.76] to the beginning,
[2786.92 → 2787.86] in your opinion,
[2788.02 → 2790.72] is the PS5 coming out in 2018?
[2790.72 → 2793.84] Even if it's December 31st.
[2795.04 → 2795.44] Okay.
[2795.76 → 2798.84] Consider that when the PS4,
[2799.24 → 2800.40] I think, was it Pro,
[2800.54 → 2801.02] came out?
[2801.78 → 2802.38] Which it was,
[2802.60 → 2803.26] it was either the Pro
[2803.26 → 2803.84] or the PS4.
[2803.96 → 2804.80] It came out in November
[2804.80 → 2805.74] and we knew about it
[2805.74 → 2806.72] in February of that year.
[2807.66 → 2808.54] If this is going to come out
[2808.54 → 2808.80] on the holiday,
[2808.80 → 2809.70] early April, yep.
[2810.00 → 2810.70] Yeah, we're two months
[2810.70 → 2811.64] beyond that now.
[2811.90 → 2812.92] It probably would be
[2812.92 → 2813.60] launching in November
[2813.60 → 2814.26] if they're trying
[2814.26 → 2814.84] to make the holiday.
[2815.48 → 2815.78] Yep.
[2816.76 → 2818.54] So that's a short media window
[2818.54 → 2820.10] to get the media hype running.
[2820.10 → 2820.86] So do you think
[2820.86 → 2821.52] it's coming out this year?
[2821.52 → 2822.42] So normally,
[2822.60 → 2823.90] I would say absolutely not.
[2824.02 → 2825.78] And the reason is that
[2825.78 → 2827.32] up until now,
[2827.40 → 2828.18] every PlayStation,
[2828.72 → 2830.38] whether it was Emotion
[2830.38 → 2831.86] or whether it was Cell
[2831.86 → 2833.22] or whether it was a move
[2833.22 → 2834.34] to Jaguar,
[2835.22 → 2836.04] every PlayStation
[2836.04 → 2837.98] has been architecturally
[2837.98 → 2839.68] dramatically different.
[2840.30 → 2841.24] Totally different.
[2842.94 → 2845.10] So if you told me in April,
[2845.42 → 2846.00] there's a PlayStation
[2846.00 → 2846.74] coming in November,
[2846.98 → 2847.72] I'd tell you to go
[2847.72 → 2848.56] take a long walk
[2848.56 → 2849.24] off a short pier
[2849.24 → 2850.06] because you're an idiot.
[2850.52 → 2851.86] Because there's no way
[2851.86 → 2852.74] that in,
[2853.02 → 2854.38] what does that work out to?
[2854.56 → 2855.28] Seven months?
[2855.48 → 2856.22] There's no way
[2856.22 → 2857.40] that in seven months
[2857.40 → 2859.32] anyone is going to have
[2859.32 → 2860.10] launch titles ready.
[2860.76 → 2861.74] Because they're going to have
[2861.74 → 2862.62] to completely
[2862.62 → 2864.76] decode aspects
[2864.76 → 2865.34] of these games
[2865.34 → 2865.86] in order to run
[2865.86 → 2866.50] on this new machine.
[2866.88 → 2867.88] The developer things
[2867.88 → 2868.74] are already out there.
[2869.30 → 2869.54] Okay.
[2869.92 → 2870.70] That is known.
[2870.92 → 2871.82] Okay, so that we know.
[2872.18 → 2872.84] But even then,
[2872.96 → 2873.58] like I'm saying,
[2873.98 → 2875.00] there's still no way
[2875.00 → 2875.66] that seven months
[2875.66 → 2876.24] would be even close.
[2876.44 → 2877.42] Like a modern AAA game,
[2877.42 → 2877.66] remember,
[2877.76 → 2878.98] you can't launch a console
[2878.98 → 2879.84] without,
[2880.70 → 2881.68] unless you're Nintendo,
[2882.30 → 2883.54] without at least a couple,
[2883.66 → 2885.20] at least a couple
[2885.20 → 2887.16] AAA tier games.
[2887.68 → 2888.74] And those take
[2888.74 → 2890.78] literally years to develop.
[2891.18 → 2892.18] And it's not going to be,
[2892.38 → 2893.96] it's not going to be good enough
[2893.96 → 2894.92] to just take
[2894.92 → 2896.14] some existing titles
[2896.14 → 2897.12] and go now at,
[2897.54 → 2898.04] you know,
[2898.12 → 2899.38] 4K with better details
[2899.38 → 2900.02] or whatever else.
[2900.16 → 2901.14] If, if, if people
[2901.14 → 2901.84] were really into that,
[2901.84 → 2902.70] they'd go buy a PC.
[2903.94 → 2904.36] However,
[2904.66 → 2906.84] because a PlayStation 5
[2906.84 → 2908.34] would be just
[2908.34 → 2909.98] PlayStation 4
[2909.98 → 2911.32] on steroids
[2911.32 → 2913.36] with Zen cores,
[2913.46 → 2914.00] which is going to make
[2914.00 → 2914.94] a big difference.
[2914.94 → 2915.76] That's going to be like
[2915.76 → 2917.02] really nice.
[2917.62 → 2918.98] And then presumably,
[2919.26 → 2919.76] and it says
[2919.76 → 2920.92] AI-based graphics,
[2921.10 → 2921.78] which would be,
[2921.84 → 2922.46] again,
[2922.60 → 2923.18] very nice.
[2923.24 → 2923.42] Remember,
[2923.48 → 2924.06] this is not Vega.
[2924.16 → 2925.80] This is a new architecture,
[2925.92 → 2926.48] past Vega.
[2928.44 → 2929.38] Because it would be
[2929.38 → 2930.54] just like that on steroids,
[2930.76 → 2931.46] new architectures,
[2931.46 → 2932.70] but much more powerful ones,
[2932.78 → 2934.06] but still fundamentally
[2934.06 → 2935.50] x86
[2935.50 → 2936.70] and,
[2936.84 → 2938.02] oh crap,
[2938.10 → 2938.44] what does AMD
[2938.44 → 2939.22] call their thing again?
[2940.28 → 2940.76] So what you're saying
[2940.76 → 2941.14] is a kind of,
[2941.14 → 2941.58] GCN.
[2941.72 → 2942.32] It's kind of like PS.
[2942.32 → 2943.46] No, not GCN anymore.
[2945.50 → 2945.78] Anyway,
[2946.00 → 2946.14] the point is.
[2946.14 → 2946.62] So you're saying
[2946.62 → 2947.30] it's kind of like
[2947.30 → 2948.92] PS4 Pro.
[2949.52 → 2949.92] Yeah,
[2950.06 → 2950.20] like,
[2950.30 → 2951.14] but way more Pro.
[2951.50 → 2952.44] Because the PS4 Pro
[2952.44 → 2953.56] relied on Crossfire,
[2953.68 → 2954.62] which was a bad approach.
[2955.60 → 2956.34] I think actually
[2956.34 → 2956.92] your theory
[2956.92 → 2958.30] might have some credence
[2958.30 → 2959.16] given that one of the other
[2959.16 → 2960.54] leaked bullet points here
[2960.54 → 2961.16] is that
[2961.16 → 2962.72] the PS5
[2962.72 → 2963.90] would be backwards compatible
[2963.90 → 2965.82] with PS4 Pro titles.
[2965.98 → 2966.40] Why not?
[2967.40 → 2968.58] It might as well be,
[2968.64 → 2968.78] right?
[2968.82 → 2969.90] Because it's
[2969.90 → 2971.12] fundamentally
[2971.12 → 2972.44] pretty similar
[2972.44 → 2973.38] in terms of the hardware.
[2974.48 → 2974.88] And
[2974.88 → 2976.16] so you've got,
[2976.34 → 2976.84] you go,
[2976.98 → 2977.34] you go.
[2978.10 → 2978.96] This site,
[2979.20 → 2979.86] semi-accurate.
[2980.60 → 2981.88] You haven't heard of it,
[2981.94 → 2982.24] apparently,
[2982.44 → 2983.42] but I've been following
[2983.42 → 2984.30] Charlie,
[2984.54 → 2985.36] I don't remember
[2985.36 → 2985.84] how to pronounce,
[2985.94 → 2986.38] Demerge?
[2986.94 → 2987.38] Demerge?
[2987.38 → 2988.10] Whatever,
[2988.24 → 2988.48] Charlie.
[2988.96 → 2989.88] I've been following
[2989.88 → 2991.04] Charlie since
[2991.04 → 2991.84] about
[2991.84 → 2993.04] 2002,
[2993.42 → 2994.16] back when he used
[2994.16 → 2994.68] to work at
[2994.68 → 2995.32] The Enquirer.
[2996.10 → 2997.70] Not the National Enquirer,
[2998.28 → 2999.22] The Enquirer.
[2999.48 → 2999.90] And
[2999.90 → 3000.90] back then,
[3001.12 → 3002.00] The Enquirer
[3002.00 → 3002.68] was
[3002.68 → 3004.06] the bomb
[3004.06 → 3005.28] for industry leaks.
[3005.28 → 3007.14] They do have a track record
[3007.14 → 3008.62] of being prescient
[3008.62 → 3010.44] at accurately leaking,
[3011.40 → 3013.32] specifically console-related
[3013.32 → 3015.20] leaks in the past.
[3015.26 → 3015.78] They've been wrong
[3015.78 → 3016.28] a couple of times
[3016.28 → 3016.62] on something.
[3016.70 → 3017.40] I can suggest
[3017.40 → 3018.44] why that might be.
[3021.52 → 3021.96] See,
[3022.14 → 3022.40] okay,
[3023.04 → 3023.84] and it makes me
[3023.84 → 3024.50] a little uncomfortable
[3024.50 → 3024.92] because
[3024.92 → 3026.36] I've never really
[3026.36 → 3027.60] talked to Charlie much,
[3027.66 → 3028.56] so I don't want to
[3028.56 → 3029.78] talk about him
[3029.78 → 3030.52] when I don't actually
[3030.52 → 3031.28] know him that well.
[3031.62 → 3032.84] But what I can say
[3032.84 → 3034.14] is that I do know
[3034.14 → 3035.98] that I've never seen him
[3035.98 → 3037.22] at an industry event
[3037.22 → 3038.76] that isn't an AMD one.
[3040.58 → 3041.18] Okay.
[3041.56 → 3042.14] So,
[3042.34 → 3043.90] what I can
[3043.90 → 3045.40] extrapolate
[3045.40 → 3046.58] from that particular
[3046.58 → 3047.30] data point
[3047.30 → 3048.50] is that
[3048.50 → 3052.06] if AMD talks to him
[3052.06 → 3053.38] and no one else does
[3053.38 → 3055.12] and he gets
[3055.12 → 3056.06] industry information
[3056.06 → 3056.66] somehow,
[3057.66 → 3058.64] that maybe he's
[3058.64 → 3059.52] getting his information
[3059.52 → 3060.74] from
[3060.74 → 3062.16] That's pretty interesting.
[3062.32 → 3063.02] contacts at AMD.
[3063.02 → 3064.98] And if he would be,
[3065.30 → 3066.62] if he has a track record
[3066.62 → 3067.94] of leaking
[3067.94 → 3069.28] console news,
[3070.10 → 3071.46] which AMD
[3071.46 → 3072.74] has their hardware
[3072.74 → 3073.24] in,
[3073.46 → 3074.80] up until the Switch,
[3074.90 → 3075.54] had their hardware
[3075.54 → 3076.82] in all three,
[3077.60 → 3079.40] that would align
[3079.40 → 3080.72] with my guesses
[3080.72 → 3081.52] as to where
[3081.52 → 3082.10] his sources
[3082.10 → 3083.90] might be from.
[3083.90 → 3085.04] So,
[3085.04 → 3085.50] that,
[3085.76 → 3086.26] to me,
[3086.62 → 3087.98] adds some credibility
[3087.98 → 3089.22] because over the years,
[3089.36 → 3090.16] Charlie has taken
[3090.16 → 3091.18] a lot of flack
[3091.18 → 3092.32] for saying a lot of stuff
[3092.32 → 3093.36] that didn't turn out
[3093.36 → 3093.86] to be true.
[3094.66 → 3095.10] But,
[3095.36 → 3098.54] as a reader of his
[3098.54 → 3099.46] over the years
[3099.46 → 3099.88] who,
[3100.28 → 3100.82] you know,
[3100.90 → 3101.66] takes rumours
[3101.66 → 3102.84] with the grain of salt
[3102.84 → 3103.82] You pay the thousand dollars
[3103.82 → 3104.04] a year?
[3104.18 → 3104.42] No.
[3104.82 → 3105.04] Okay.
[3105.14 → 3106.26] Are you a student?
[3106.42 → 3107.14] I read before
[3107.14 → 3109.88] he put up the paywall.
[3110.32 → 3110.44] So,
[3110.60 → 3111.28] but as someone
[3111.28 → 3111.92] who's kind of
[3111.92 → 3112.38] paid attention
[3112.38 → 3113.06] to his career,
[3113.22 → 3113.74] he's been
[3113.74 → 3115.02] right enough
[3115.02 → 3115.98] that if you
[3115.98 → 3117.58] read with the grain of salt
[3117.58 → 3118.60] that you should take rumours
[3118.60 → 3119.66] with in the first place,
[3120.34 → 3121.28] and he called the site
[3121.28 → 3122.02] semi-accurate.
[3122.08 → 3122.22] I mean,
[3122.24 → 3123.06] what more do you want?
[3124.62 → 3125.54] He's offered a lot
[3125.54 → 3125.98] of insight
[3125.98 → 3127.56] over the years.
[3128.12 → 3129.46] That's what I'll say.
[3129.74 → 3129.76] So,
[3129.90 → 3131.56] I'm not saying,
[3131.72 → 3131.82] yeah,
[3131.88 → 3133.04] there's going to be a PS5,
[3133.36 → 3134.68] but I would suggest
[3134.68 → 3136.04] that this might be
[3136.04 → 3136.94] why
[3136.94 → 3139.50] Sony hasn't had a response
[3139.50 → 3140.82] to the Xbox One X yet,
[3141.26 → 3141.94] and
[3141.94 → 3143.70] this might have been
[3143.70 → 3144.62] a good move for them
[3144.62 → 3146.34] to let Microsoft
[3146.34 → 3147.56] launch the One X
[3147.56 → 3148.56] a few months ago
[3148.56 → 3149.58] and then say,
[3149.68 → 3149.80] okay,
[3149.80 → 3150.34] you know what?
[3150.38 → 3151.22] We're going to miss out
[3151.22 → 3152.08] on having the crown
[3152.08 → 3152.86] for like a year,
[3153.00 → 3154.08] but realistically,
[3154.68 → 3156.20] Microsoft can't run out
[3156.20 → 3157.54] and release
[3157.54 → 3158.64] a new Xbox
[3158.64 → 3160.02] again.
[3160.82 → 3161.10] So,
[3161.42 → 3162.28] we're giving up
[3162.28 → 3163.20] this year now
[3163.20 → 3164.28] of console,
[3164.64 → 3165.18] you know,
[3165.62 → 3166.14] throned,
[3166.56 → 3167.38] but we should have
[3167.38 → 3168.08] a year or maybe
[3168.08 → 3168.74] more than that
[3168.74 → 3169.22] afterward
[3169.22 → 3170.64] while Microsoft responds.
[3171.16 → 3171.26] Yeah,
[3171.28 → 3171.84] they want to wait
[3171.84 → 3173.30] until the PS4 Pro sales
[3173.30 → 3173.98] have peaked
[3173.98 → 3174.42] and are starting
[3174.42 → 3175.22] to taper off,
[3176.00 → 3177.56] but also enough time
[3177.56 → 3178.76] so people,
[3178.96 → 3179.76] so some people
[3179.76 → 3180.96] who bought a PS4 Pro
[3180.96 → 3182.82] will also buy
[3182.82 → 3184.10] a PS5
[3184.10 → 3184.76] at launch.
[3185.70 → 3185.98] Obviously,
[3186.02 → 3186.52] not everyone's
[3186.52 → 3186.98] going to do that.
[3187.10 → 3187.94] Another major factor
[3187.94 → 3188.94] is that they're
[3188.94 → 3190.30] at AMD's mercy here.
[3190.64 → 3191.38] They can't release
[3191.38 → 3192.26] a faster console
[3192.26 → 3193.36] until AMD releases
[3193.36 → 3194.46] a faster freaking
[3194.46 → 3195.14] piece of hardware.
[3196.08 → 3196.48] So,
[3197.02 → 3198.78] that custom SoC
[3198.78 → 3199.68] design process
[3199.68 → 3200.40] takes time
[3200.40 → 3201.58] and you can't
[3201.58 → 3202.52] start that process
[3202.52 → 3203.10] until
[3203.10 → 3205.00] the individual
[3205.00 → 3205.98] components of it,
[3206.10 → 3206.90] so both the CPU
[3206.90 → 3207.92] and GPU,
[3208.28 → 3209.04] are at least
[3209.04 → 3209.90] somewhat finalized.
[3210.30 → 3210.40] So,
[3210.56 → 3211.38] that looks,
[3211.54 → 3211.78] I mean,
[3211.84 → 3212.30] that timeline
[3212.30 → 3213.20] sounds not that,
[3213.54 → 3214.06] you know what?
[3214.16 → 3214.88] The more we talk
[3214.88 → 3215.40] about this,
[3216.66 → 3217.74] I'm going with it.
[3217.74 → 3217.98] Oh,
[3218.22 → 3219.28] PS5,
[3219.90 → 3220.62] this Q4.
[3220.80 → 3221.24] It's on.
[3221.40 → 3221.84] Put your balls
[3221.84 → 3222.28] on the table.
[3222.40 → 3222.82] There you go.
[3222.96 → 3223.44] Bet something.
[3224.76 → 3225.10] So,
[3225.18 → 3225.80] the bet would be
[3225.80 → 3226.78] either it's coming
[3226.78 → 3227.86] out holiday season
[3227.86 → 3229.04] or it's being
[3229.04 → 3230.24] announced at E3
[3230.24 → 3232.98] next June?
[3234.14 → 3234.70] Or I guess
[3234.70 → 3235.22] this June.
[3235.50 → 3235.66] Yeah,
[3235.68 → 3236.00] I don't know.
[3237.46 → 3238.00] I'm going to say
[3238.00 → 3239.38] it's coming holiday season.
[3239.48 → 3240.18] I don't know exactly
[3240.18 → 3240.58] how they're going
[3240.58 → 3241.12] to handle the hype
[3241.12 → 3241.86] leading up to the release,
[3241.94 → 3242.40] but you know what?
[3242.42 → 3242.66] I'm in.
[3243.36 → 3243.86] When are they
[3243.86 → 3244.50] going to announce it?
[3244.60 → 3245.08] They can't wait
[3245.08 → 3245.98] until E3 at June.
[3246.78 → 3247.26] Could they?
[3247.30 → 3247.42] Yeah,
[3247.42 → 3247.72] they could.
[3247.82 → 3247.94] Yeah,
[3247.98 → 3248.42] that gives them
[3248.42 → 3248.94] like a few months.
[3248.96 → 3249.82] Do they need to announce
[3249.82 → 3250.50] it at a conference
[3250.50 → 3251.58] or an event
[3251.58 → 3252.20] or can they just
[3252.20 → 3253.50] launch it?
[3253.62 → 3254.46] More and more companies.
[3254.74 → 3255.02] Excuse me,
[3255.06 → 3255.72] I mean announce it.
[3255.92 → 3256.72] Microsoft did this
[3256.72 → 3257.62] for the Xbox One.
[3258.50 → 3259.34] More and more companies
[3259.34 → 3259.92] are just doing
[3259.92 → 3260.74] an Apple style
[3260.74 → 3262.44] conference.
[3263.32 → 3263.74] They're just doing,
[3263.80 → 3264.14] you know what?
[3264.82 → 3265.28] Forget it.
[3265.30 → 3265.62] We're not going
[3265.62 → 3266.08] to announce things
[3266.08 → 3266.74] at CES
[3266.74 → 3267.38] or Computer
[3267.38 → 3267.78] or E3
[3267.78 → 3268.00] or whatever.
[3268.10 → 3269.24] We'll do our own party.
[3269.36 → 3269.86] But they do it,
[3269.96 → 3270.46] Apple does it
[3270.46 → 3271.24] at their own conference
[3271.24 → 3271.60] every year.
[3272.08 → 3272.58] But does Sony
[3272.58 → 3273.10] have one of those?
[3273.96 → 3274.76] I don't know
[3274.76 → 3275.44] if Sony's done that
[3275.44 → 3276.14] but more and more
[3276.14 → 3276.84] companies are trying
[3276.84 → 3277.26] to do this.
[3277.32 → 3277.72] So yeah,
[3277.72 → 3278.34] let's find out.
[3278.88 → 3280.00] Maybe they'll just
[3280.00 → 3280.50] do their own thing.
[3281.94 → 3283.32] I'm seeing CES,
[3283.46 → 3284.46] I'm seeing E3,
[3284.46 → 3285.90] MWC.
[3285.90 → 3286.24] You never know.
[3287.24 → 3288.00] Speaking of things
[3288.00 → 3288.68] you never know,
[3289.00 → 3289.88] you never know
[3289.88 → 3290.70] when Big Brother
[3290.70 → 3291.34] is watching.
[3291.78 → 3292.56] The original article
[3292.56 → 3293.58] here is from CNET.
[3293.96 → 3294.74] Sorry for the abrupt
[3294.74 → 3295.38] change in topics
[3295.38 → 3296.06] but I really want
[3296.06 → 3296.58] to cover this
[3296.58 → 3297.18] and it's like
[3297.18 → 3298.22] 20 after 6 already
[3298.22 → 3299.16] and I really want
[3299.16 → 3299.72] to talk about this.
[3300.90 → 3302.06] I am going
[3302.06 → 3303.48] to Shenzhen
[3303.48 → 3304.56] on Monday.
[3306.32 → 3308.00] So an AI company
[3308.00 → 3308.70] that works with
[3308.70 → 3309.54] Shenzhen police
[3309.54 → 3311.04] is creating a system
[3311.04 → 3311.94] that will use
[3311.94 → 3313.22] CCTV cameras
[3313.22 → 3314.78] to identify
[3314.78 → 3315.82] jaywalkers
[3315.82 → 3316.46] and send them
[3316.46 → 3317.06] a fine
[3317.06 → 3318.82] via a messaging app.
[3319.56 → 3319.86] Okay,
[3319.98 → 3321.42] so full disclosure
[3321.42 → 3321.72] here,
[3322.34 → 3323.32] that CNET article
[3323.32 → 3324.62] is from July 2017
[3324.62 → 3325.54] because this is
[3325.54 → 3326.44] the fact that
[3326.44 → 3328.54] people are getting
[3328.54 → 3329.56] in trouble,
[3329.72 → 3330.28] like their faces
[3330.28 → 3331.06] are being projected
[3331.06 → 3332.26] onto a giant billboard
[3332.26 → 3333.18] in real time
[3333.18 → 3334.14] because these facial
[3334.14 → 3335.12] recognition equipped
[3335.12 → 3336.56] cameras are watching
[3336.56 → 3337.42] them jaywalk.
[3337.60 → 3338.60] That's old news.
[3338.76 → 3339.58] That's been since
[3339.58 → 3340.14] last summer.
[3340.52 → 3342.00] The new update
[3342.00 → 3343.34] now is that
[3343.34 → 3344.50] if that happens
[3344.50 → 3344.88] to you,
[3345.16 → 3345.66] you might just
[3345.66 → 3346.34] get an SMS
[3346.34 → 3346.96] that's like,
[3347.02 → 3347.62] here's your fine,
[3347.74 → 3347.88] bud,
[3348.00 → 3348.44] click through
[3348.44 → 3349.12] and pay it.
[3350.90 → 3351.66] Could be SMS,
[3351.80 → 3352.64] could be in WeChat,
[3352.78 → 3353.22] which is,
[3353.42 → 3353.90] I guess,
[3353.96 → 3354.38] gets compared
[3354.38 → 3355.48] to Chinese WhatsApp.
[3356.44 → 3357.96] So over 10 months,
[3358.10 → 3358.82] ending in February
[3358.82 → 3359.44] of this year,
[3359.76 → 3360.50] these boards
[3360.50 → 3361.36] that they created
[3361.36 → 3364.24] displayed 13,930
[3364.24 → 3365.44] jaywalker faces.
[3366.38 → 3367.70] It's like a public
[3367.70 → 3368.64] shaming thing
[3368.64 → 3369.00] or something,
[3369.00 → 3369.02] I guess?
[3369.02 → 3369.04] Yeah,
[3369.10 → 3369.22] well,
[3369.26 → 3370.08] apparently jaywalking
[3370.08 → 3370.72] is a bigger deal
[3370.72 → 3371.10] in China
[3371.10 → 3372.82] than it is over here.
[3373.08 → 3373.78] I can kind of see that.
[3373.82 → 3374.48] There's more people,
[3374.62 → 3375.22] they have a different
[3375.22 → 3375.60] attitude,
[3376.38 → 3377.30] both the pedestrians
[3377.30 → 3377.90] have a different
[3377.90 → 3378.92] attitude to the law,
[3379.18 → 3380.48] according to Chinese
[3380.48 → 3382.22] political party
[3382.22 → 3382.98] opinion anyway,
[3383.12 → 3384.08] and drivers have
[3384.08 → 3385.02] a different standpoint
[3385.02 → 3386.22] to pedestrian
[3386.22 → 3387.00] right of way.
[3387.10 → 3387.42] Apparently,
[3387.98 → 3389.86] I saw there are studies
[3389.86 → 3390.90] where in Germany
[3390.90 → 3391.68] you might only wait
[3391.68 → 3392.34] 60 seconds
[3392.34 → 3393.04] to cross the road,
[3393.12 → 3394.12] but in China
[3394.12 → 3395.28] it might be 90 seconds
[3395.28 → 3395.82] and that's longer
[3395.82 → 3396.74] than people need to wait.
[3396.88 → 3397.38] And even when
[3397.38 → 3397.94] it's their turn,
[3397.94 → 3398.74] the drivers might
[3398.74 → 3399.64] still just
[3399.64 → 3401.52] not respect
[3401.52 → 3402.20] their right of way
[3402.20 → 3402.58] anyway.
[3403.00 → 3404.18] So there's a lot
[3404.18 → 3404.92] of jaywalking
[3404.92 → 3405.80] and presumably
[3405.80 → 3406.68] because of the
[3406.68 → 3407.32] number of people
[3407.32 → 3407.52] there,
[3407.68 → 3409.28] it causes a lot
[3409.28 → 3409.76] of traffic
[3409.76 → 3410.44] and bottlenecks.
[3410.62 → 3411.34] So there's a high
[3411.34 → 3412.48] incentive for the
[3412.48 → 3413.12] government to try
[3413.12 → 3413.92] to work this out.
[3414.00 → 3414.66] So one of the ways
[3414.66 → 3415.64] they'll disincentivize
[3415.64 → 3416.80] people to jaywalk
[3416.80 → 3417.84] is by socially
[3417.84 → 3418.36] shaming them,
[3418.40 → 3419.02] putting their face
[3419.02 → 3420.02] and their family name
[3420.02 → 3420.52] by the way,
[3420.76 → 3421.52] up on a giant
[3421.52 → 3422.30] billboard that you
[3422.30 → 3422.74] can see.
[3423.44 → 3424.16] And now,
[3424.30 → 3424.96] I guess they're
[3424.96 → 3425.34] attaching
[3425.34 → 3427.50] a monetary incentive
[3427.50 → 3428.50] or disincentive
[3428.50 → 3429.66] on that as well.
[3429.76 → 3429.96] I mean,
[3430.02 → 3430.62] this is just so
[3430.62 → 3431.22] apparently only
[3431.22 → 3432.04] about 10%
[3432.04 → 3432.86] of the population
[3432.86 → 3433.66] can be identified
[3433.66 → 3434.50] by the city
[3434.50 → 3435.44] or by the system
[3435.44 → 3436.04] in the city
[3436.04 → 3437.08] of Shenzhen.
[3437.92 → 3439.92] But if you consider
[3439.92 → 3441.40] that they're already
[3441.40 → 3442.26] working with
[3442.26 → 3443.66] third parties
[3443.66 → 3444.98] like these chat
[3444.98 → 3445.54] applications
[3445.54 → 3447.56] to deliver fines,
[3448.00 → 3448.84] presumably they could
[3448.84 → 3449.36] work with
[3449.36 → 3450.88] third parties
[3450.88 → 3451.86] like,
[3452.08 → 3453.36] crap,
[3453.48 → 3453.94] what's their
[3453.94 → 3455.12] Amazon,
[3455.36 → 3455.74] Alibaba?
[3456.02 → 3456.48] Like they could
[3456.48 → 3457.30] work with Alibaba.
[3457.30 → 3457.72] AliExpress.
[3458.38 → 3458.88] Well, no,
[3458.90 → 3459.72] AliExpress is
[3459.72 → 3460.42] part,
[3460.50 → 3461.02] is like...
[3461.02 → 3461.22] Yeah,
[3461.28 → 3462.02] but Alibaba is
[3462.02 → 3463.14] like to contact
[3463.14 → 3463.78] manufacturers,
[3463.98 → 3464.90] not to just buy stuff.
[3464.92 → 3465.10] you're right,
[3465.16 → 3465.42] you're right.
[3466.26 → 3467.02] So they could
[3467.02 → 3468.02] work with...
[3468.02 → 3468.24] Wait,
[3468.32 → 3468.90] hold on a second.
[3470.80 → 3471.18] Oh,
[3471.28 → 3471.76] where's he going?
[3475.66 → 3476.62] Alibaba Group,
[3477.16 → 3478.22] Chinese multinational
[3478.22 → 3478.52] e-com...
[3478.52 → 3478.64] Yeah,
[3478.70 → 3478.78] no,
[3478.84 → 3479.48] Alibaba Group,
[3479.56 → 3479.86] not like
[3479.86 → 3480.66] Alibaba.com
[3480.66 → 3481.12] necessarily.
[3481.42 → 3481.68] Okay.
[3482.24 → 3482.64] Anyway,
[3482.80 → 3483.72] so the point is
[3483.72 → 3484.84] that they could
[3484.84 → 3485.54] work with companies
[3485.54 → 3486.22] like that
[3486.22 → 3487.48] that have...
[3487.48 → 3487.90] Or they could
[3487.90 → 3488.52] work with
[3488.52 → 3489.48] Chinese phone
[3489.48 → 3490.20] manufacturers,
[3490.38 → 3490.90] for example,
[3491.08 → 3491.54] that...
[3492.66 → 3493.14] I'm not going
[3493.14 → 3493.88] to say who
[3493.88 → 3494.76] or what they're
[3494.76 → 3495.40] doing now,
[3495.50 → 3496.56] but have been
[3496.56 → 3497.74] known in the past
[3497.74 → 3498.56] to put,
[3498.64 → 3498.92] you know,
[3498.96 → 3499.60] back doors on
[3499.60 → 3500.50] phones and...
[3500.50 → 3501.42] Or share information
[3501.42 → 3501.90] with the Chinese
[3501.90 → 3502.24] government.
[3502.62 → 3503.24] So they could
[3503.24 → 3503.96] work with these
[3503.96 → 3505.46] groups to make
[3505.46 → 3506.42] the facial recognition
[3506.42 → 3507.62] just one part
[3507.62 → 3508.28] of how they
[3508.28 → 3509.02] identify you.
[3509.22 → 3510.10] So they could
[3510.10 → 3511.10] monitor where you go,
[3511.38 → 3512.12] what you buy,
[3512.40 → 3513.04] who you spend
[3513.04 → 3513.82] your time with,
[3513.94 → 3514.70] and they could
[3514.70 → 3515.46] use all of these
[3515.46 → 3516.88] things to augment
[3516.88 → 3517.88] their facial recognition
[3517.88 → 3519.36] technology so that
[3519.36 → 3520.08] they could actually
[3520.08 → 3521.72] make a very,
[3521.96 → 3523.14] very good guess
[3523.14 → 3525.78] as to who you are
[3525.78 → 3526.96] even if they don't
[3526.96 → 3528.04] get a perfect look
[3528.04 → 3528.56] at your face.
[3528.68 → 3529.10] And where you are.
[3529.16 → 3529.84] They can track you
[3529.84 → 3530.50] while you're driving
[3530.50 → 3531.02] your car.
[3531.18 → 3531.46] Exactly.
[3531.48 → 3532.12] There are apparently
[3532.12 → 3533.76] 600 million CCTV
[3533.76 → 3534.94] cameras in China.
[3535.58 → 3536.68] It's like...
[3536.68 → 3537.64] It's getting to
[3537.64 → 3538.36] full-on surveillance
[3538.36 → 3538.78] state.
[3539.34 → 3540.22] And some of these
[3540.22 → 3540.96] things are positive,
[3540.96 → 3542.22] like there are benefits
[3542.22 → 3542.78] from it.
[3543.50 → 3544.44] You can go to
[3544.44 → 3545.34] certain airports in
[3545.34 → 3547.00] China and not have
[3547.00 → 3547.56] a boarding pass.
[3547.62 → 3548.20] It's all facial
[3548.20 → 3548.66] recognition.
[3548.96 → 3549.66] Your hands are full
[3549.66 → 3550.26] of your bags.
[3550.64 → 3551.86] You just walk by
[3551.86 → 3553.74] the attendant as you
[3553.74 → 3554.38] go onto the plane.
[3554.52 → 3555.50] Like that's pretty
[3555.50 → 3555.86] sweet.
[3556.30 → 3556.58] Wow.
[3557.74 → 3558.36] Maybe you'll get to
[3558.36 → 3558.72] do that.
[3558.98 → 3559.58] If you're in an
[3559.58 → 3560.24] airport that has
[3560.24 → 3560.74] that, you should
[3560.74 → 3561.18] make a video.
[3562.30 → 3562.84] There's no way
[3562.84 → 3563.36] I'll be able to do
[3563.36 → 3563.88] it because I won't
[3563.88 → 3565.04] be registered.
[3565.32 → 3565.96] In fact, the reason
[3565.96 → 3566.98] why only 10% of the
[3566.98 → 3567.88] population of Shenzhen
[3567.88 → 3569.62] gets their faces
[3569.62 → 3570.94] recognized is because
[3570.94 → 3573.36] presumably it's
[3573.36 → 3574.06] like the database
[3574.06 → 3574.96] of all the
[3574.96 → 3575.64] different provinces
[3575.64 → 3576.46] isn't integrated.
[3576.66 → 3577.48] So if you live in
[3577.48 → 3577.94] Shenzhen, but you're
[3577.94 → 3578.30] from a different
[3578.30 → 3579.42] province, then they
[3579.42 → 3579.98] just don't have
[3579.98 → 3581.32] your record available.
[3582.70 → 3583.52] So that's why they
[3583.52 → 3584.06] think that the
[3584.06 → 3584.68] number of people
[3584.68 → 3586.04] who will be
[3586.04 → 3586.88] susceptible to this
[3586.88 → 3588.20] tech should go up
[3588.20 → 3589.08] dramatically once they
[3589.08 → 3590.54] do get a more
[3590.54 → 3591.70] broadly based system
[3591.70 → 3593.38] in the future.
[3593.88 → 3594.46] All right.
[3594.72 → 3595.62] Last topic for the
[3595.62 → 3596.78] day because we are
[3596.78 → 3597.46] not going to stop
[3597.46 → 3598.26] harping on this,
[3598.40 → 3599.92] at least until you
[3599.92 → 3600.44] guys get bored
[3600.44 → 3600.74] of it.
[3603.46 → 3604.58] More GeForce
[3604.58 → 3605.60] partner program
[3605.60 → 3606.14] news.
[3607.64 → 3610.04] Asus to Ares.
[3610.92 → 3611.58] Is it just me or
[3611.58 → 3612.22] does that sound like
[3612.22 → 3612.78] kind of like a
[3612.78 → 3613.26] Spanish?
[3613.68 → 3614.48] I'm actually trying to
[3614.48 → 3615.38] figure out if it's
[3615.38 → 3616.04] supposed to be like
[3616.04 → 3616.60] Ares.
[3617.34 → 3618.58] Well, Ares used to
[3618.58 → 3618.72] be.
[3618.72 → 3619.76] They had Ares before
[3619.76 → 3620.62] with an S on the
[3620.62 → 3620.78] end.
[3621.00 → 3621.60] What they called
[3621.60 → 3623.02] their DOG AMD
[3623.02 → 3623.82] based cards.
[3624.32 → 3625.28] So it was at the
[3625.28 → 3626.06] very high end.
[3626.14 → 3627.04] They had Mars on the
[3627.04 → 3627.56] Nvidia side.
[3627.56 → 3628.00] Well, maybe that's
[3628.00 → 3629.38] intentional because
[3629.38 → 3630.02] they're not allowed to
[3630.02 → 3631.06] say DOG anymore.
[3631.26 → 3631.96] They're still saying
[3631.96 → 3632.42] Strip.
[3633.44 → 3634.48] So maybe people
[3634.48 → 3635.32] will remember that
[3635.32 → 3637.28] Ares was DOG.
[3637.48 → 3639.14] Because losing DOG
[3639.14 → 3640.02] hurts, man.
[3640.10 → 3640.44] Like people,
[3640.64 → 3641.32] consumers know what
[3641.32 → 3642.54] DOG is and they
[3642.54 → 3643.12] want to buy it.
[3643.16 → 3643.80] Which is still
[3643.80 → 3644.64] bizarre to me because
[3644.64 → 3645.28] I still remember
[3645.28 → 3646.14] being just like
[3646.14 → 3647.66] baffled and angered
[3647.66 → 3648.82] by the original
[3648.82 → 3650.42] implementation of
[3650.42 → 3650.94] that branding.
[3651.34 → 3651.84] I was just like,
[3652.00 → 3652.70] this is so stupid.
[3653.12 → 3653.92] What does Republic of
[3653.92 → 3654.64] Gamers even mean?
[3654.70 → 3655.28] What is this like a
[3655.28 → 3656.18] place where all the
[3656.18 → 3656.80] gamers live?
[3656.88 → 3657.38] You've never been.
[3659.24 → 3660.12] It smells weird,
[3660.20 → 3660.78] but it's pretty dope
[3660.78 → 3660.98] there.
[3664.84 → 3665.62] That's what we need
[3665.62 → 3666.36] as a new sponsor.
[3666.60 → 3667.30] Like a deodorant
[3667.30 → 3667.68] product.
[3668.24 → 3669.54] People's Republic of
[3669.54 → 3669.64] Gamers.
[3669.64 → 3670.16] The sales pitch
[3670.16 → 3670.74] writes itself.
[3670.86 → 3671.20] It's like,
[3671.56 → 3672.36] too busy gaming to
[3672.36 → 3672.66] shower?
[3673.26 → 3674.40] Just use this spray.
[3675.18 → 3676.00] No problem.
[3676.58 → 3677.24] At least for a
[3677.24 → 3677.58] little while.
[3678.30 → 3678.84] Eventually you'll
[3678.84 → 3679.30] have a problem.
[3682.06 → 3682.62] Touristic!
[3682.62 → 3684.30] Asus DOG Strip
[3684.30 → 3685.06] turns into
[3685.06 → 3687.30] Ares Strip.
[3688.00 → 3689.04] Asus Duel
[3689.04 → 3690.16] turns into
[3690.16 → 3691.86] Ares Duel.
[3692.78 → 3693.84] Asus Expedition,
[3693.92 → 3694.30] which I've never
[3694.30 → 3695.14] even heard of before,
[3695.26 → 3695.82] turns into
[3695.82 → 3696.80] Ares Expedition.
[3696.84 → 3697.52] It's way out there.
[3697.54 → 3698.60] So not only
[3698.60 → 3700.42] do we appear
[3700.42 → 3702.52] to be losing
[3702.52 → 3704.52] DOG branding,
[3704.90 → 3705.78] it looks like
[3705.78 → 3706.58] they aren't even
[3706.58 → 3707.74] putting Asus
[3707.74 → 3708.54] branding on the
[3708.54 → 3708.86] cards.
[3708.86 → 3712.72] That weirds
[3712.72 → 3713.26] me out a little
[3713.26 → 3713.54] bit.
[3714.22 → 3714.68] Isn't that a
[3714.68 → 3714.90] maybe?
[3715.22 → 3716.58] At what point is
[3716.58 → 3717.18] somebody going to
[3717.18 → 3718.32] leak this freaking
[3718.32 → 3719.58] agreement so that
[3719.58 → 3720.18] we can have a look
[3720.18 → 3720.42] at it?
[3720.48 → 3721.90] Because I'll tell
[3721.90 → 3722.06] you,
[3722.14 → 3723.88] 99% of the time
[3723.88 → 3725.94] when some
[3725.94 → 3727.14] controversial
[3727.14 → 3728.34] document gets
[3728.34 → 3728.94] leaked or whatever,
[3729.44 → 3730.56] I'll read a bunch
[3730.56 → 3731.00] of articles,
[3731.16 → 3731.68] figure out what
[3731.68 → 3732.48] the consensus is,
[3732.54 → 3732.76] and go,
[3732.86 → 3733.40] okay, yeah.
[3733.68 → 3734.98] Or I might read
[3734.98 → 3735.46] a couple of
[3735.46 → 3736.14] paragraphs of the
[3736.14 → 3736.26] thing.
[3736.36 → 3737.56] If the G-Force
[3737.56 → 3738.20] partner program
[3738.20 → 3738.44] leaked,
[3738.56 → 3738.94] I would read
[3738.94 → 3739.32] the whole
[3739.32 → 3739.66] thing,
[3739.82 → 3740.52] like multiple
[3740.52 → 3740.92] times.
[3741.08 → 3742.32] I want to
[3742.32 → 3742.80] understand.
[3743.12 → 3743.46] I don't just
[3743.46 → 3743.86] want to see
[3743.86 → 3744.40] what's in there.
[3744.72 → 3745.18] I want to
[3745.18 → 3746.04] understand what's
[3746.04 → 3746.48] in there because
[3746.48 → 3747.12] this sounds like
[3747.12 → 3747.96] a scary
[3747.96 → 3749.20] freaking document.
[3749.58 → 3749.98] Well, in the
[3749.98 → 3750.38] original,
[3751.12 → 3752.12] what's the site
[3752.12 → 3752.66] that leaked it?
[3753.22 → 3753.66] Hard OCP,
[3753.88 → 3753.96] right?
[3754.46 → 3755.20] In that original
[3755.20 → 3756.80] blog post or
[3756.80 → 3757.24] article,
[3758.04 → 3760.50] he wondered
[3760.50 → 3761.34] if it was
[3761.34 → 3762.06] actually legal.
[3764.32 → 3765.12] I don't know,
[3765.18 → 3765.44] man.
[3766.22 → 3767.02] Me too.
[3768.20 → 3768.56] So,
[3768.62 → 3768.86] thanks for
[3768.86 → 3769.14] watching,
[3769.24 → 3769.52] guys.
[3769.78 → 3770.40] See you again
[3770.40 → 3770.84] next week.
[3770.94 → 3771.28] Same bad
[3771.28 → 3771.60] time,
[3771.70 → 3772.08] same bad
[3772.08 → 3772.42] channel.
[3772.92 → 3773.46] So much
[3773.46 → 3773.74] bacon.
[3773.94 → 3774.42] Maybe a different
[3774.42 → 3774.82] co-host.
[3777.04 → 3777.48] No,
[3777.88 → 3778.12] no,
[3778.20 → 3778.38] no,
[3778.44 → 3778.64] no,
[3778.64 → 3779.12] hold on,
[3779.16 → 3779.32] no,
[3779.38 → 3779.80] hold on,
[3779.88 → 3780.10] no,
[3780.18 → 3781.04] hold on a minute.
[3781.04 → 3781.50] Same bad
[3781.50 → 3781.92] time,
[3782.34 → 3783.34] variable co-host.
[3783.52 → 3784.16] Hold on a minute.
[3784.46 → 3784.58] Wait,
[3784.66 → 3784.98] are you looking at
[3784.98 → 3785.56] the dates of
[3785.56 → 3785.86] tax?
[3785.94 → 3786.22] No,
[3786.26 → 3786.50] no,
[3786.50 → 3786.60] no,
[3786.60 → 3786.74] no,
[3786.80 → 3787.06] we're going to
[3787.06 → 3787.92] straw pull this.
[3787.98 → 3788.20] We're going to
[3788.20 → 3788.82] straw pull this.
[3789.50 → 3789.90] James.
[3790.98 → 3791.26] Okay,
[3791.62 → 3792.32] good
[3792.32 → 3793.58] job.
[3793.58 → 3795.70] All right,
[3795.76 → 3796.38] let's get some
[3796.38 → 3797.14] options in here.
[3797.80 → 3798.20] Yes,
[3798.90 → 3799.48] no,
[3800.80 → 3802.24] donkey balls.
[3802.70 → 3802.96] Ooh,
[3803.60 → 3804.42] I'm going to log in
[3804.42 → 3805.34] and vote donkey balls.
[3805.38 → 3806.48] Create this pull here.
[3806.72 → 3807.02] Come on,
[3807.04 → 3807.40] you guys.
[3808.20 → 3808.92] You got to let us know.
[3809.02 → 3810.24] Do you really want a new
[3810.24 → 3811.08] co-host next week?
[3811.08 → 3813.42] I guess I ignored the
[3813.42 → 3815.34] possibility that the new
[3815.34 → 3816.80] co-host being replaced
[3816.80 → 3818.04] would be me because I'm
[3818.04 → 3818.86] travelling next week.
[3819.30 → 3819.66] Oh,
[3819.74 → 3819.98] yeah.
[3820.40 → 3821.66] Some people have said that
[3821.66 → 3822.40] Luke James is their
[3822.40 → 3823.00] favourite combo.
[3824.40 → 3824.84] Well,
[3824.90 → 3825.74] it was my mom.
[3829.08 → 3830.02] She's biased.
[3831.14 → 3831.58] Oh,
[3831.70 → 3832.78] terrible.
[3833.12 → 3833.32] Hey,
[3833.40 → 3834.30] more donkey balls than
[3834.30 → 3834.68] nose.
[3834.78 → 3835.18] Come on,
[3835.22 → 3835.80] donkey balls.
[3835.80 → 3836.24] Let's get it.
[3836.32 → 3837.18] Let's get our act together
[3837.18 → 3837.44] here.
[3837.48 → 3838.16] That's a win.
[3838.32 → 3839.32] I want to see some more
[3839.32 → 3839.90] donkey ball.
[3839.90 → 3842.80] That's what the poster
[3842.80 → 3844.00] on your office door is
[3844.00 → 3844.56] about.
[3845.56 → 3846.86] Donkey balls inside.
[3846.98 → 3847.14] Well,
[3847.18 → 3847.76] I didn't need the whole
[3847.76 → 3848.52] donkey for that.
[3848.64 → 3848.86] Wait,
[3849.62 → 3850.66] Linus likes donkey balls.
[3851.02 → 3851.78] James donkey.
[3854.32 → 3855.26] And we'll see you again
[3855.26 → 3855.76] next week.
[3858.54 → 3859.26] Good show.
[3859.42 → 3860.52] Most people said good job.
[3860.86 → 3861.18] Cool.
[3861.66 → 3862.46] 51%
[3862.46 → 3863.28] so it's like a very
[3863.28 → 3863.90] narrow most.
[3864.62 → 3864.94] Oh,
[3864.94 → 3865.32] oh.
[3868.66 → 3869.62] That was a good show.
[3869.90 → 3870.14] No,
[3870.20 → 3870.38] it was fun.
[3870.58 → 3871.50] Felt smooth.
[3872.30 → 3873.00] You know we're still
[3873.00 → 3873.26] live,
[3873.32 → 3873.38] right?
[3873.44 → 3873.84] That's good.
[3875.58 → 3876.54] Felt smooth,
[3876.84 → 3877.44] buttery,
[3878.12 → 3879.16] savage jerky smooth.
[3879.82 → 3880.70] Smooth like honey.
[3881.62 → 3882.74] Thresh books.
[3882.98 → 3883.54] Number four.
[3887.94 → 3888.42] Sriracha.
