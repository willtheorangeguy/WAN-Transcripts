[0.00 --> 8.88]  and we're live it's WAN show time again welcome to the best show that takes place
[8.88 --> 18.00]  on Friday afternoon on this particular channel that's all that's yes I mean I
[18.00 --> 21.36]  wouldn't compare it to anything else because nothing else is really quite like
[21.36 --> 28.12]  the WAN show so I have a special co-host this week and the story behind this is
[28.12 --> 32.56]  actually a good one so Alex here has actually worked at Linus Media Group
[32.56 --> 37.48]  for the better part of almost like two years now is that right no yeah yeah
[37.48 --> 43.78]  pretty close Wow so this will be your two year like annual performance review
[43.78 --> 49.24]  coming up like next month yeah that's incredible so on his performance review
[49.24 --> 53.74]  will be a lot of good things like Alex has done a great job of our laptop content
[53.74 --> 57.58]  a lot of our more makery content he installed the single most dangerous
[57.58 --> 63.34]  thing in our entire studio a few weeks ago CNC you don't agree that's the most
[63.34 --> 68.68]  dangerous thing in our studio probably not okay what's more dangerous um other
[68.68 --> 71.44]  than Dennis with a power tool that doesn't count you don't get to just take
[71.44 --> 75.10]  Dennis plus something and create something more dangerous than the CNC
[75.10 --> 79.38]  because you could just have Dennis the CNC there was that time when the laptop
[79.38 --> 84.94]  cart the like AC power screwed up and it was just like the whole laptop cart had AC
[84.94 --> 90.70]  power okay but I'm talking present tense the most dangerous thing in our office
[90.70 --> 99.18]  that was pretty bad that was a bad scene anyway there's gonna be lots of good
[99.18 --> 103.94]  things but then we had him on to host an episode of tech linked a couple of weeks
[103.94 --> 109.70]  ago and um so actually we the first time he did it was a couple months ago and I
[109.70 --> 116.84]  watched it and I was like okay yeah like you kind of warmed up more towards the end and you had your
[116.84 --> 120.92]  moments you had like some pretty brilliant moments like the intro I thought was great
[120.92 --> 128.52]  and I checked in I was like so you didn't realize the camera was on yet no slash didn't realize they were
[128.52 --> 133.38]  going to use it no I knew that you knew they were going to use it okay that's not what you said in
[133.38 --> 140.40]  our meeting anyway yeah well anyway the point is there were these moments of brilliance and I was
[140.40 --> 144.82]  like okay there's potential here but you and I need to kind of meet about hosting style before
[144.82 --> 151.54]  before you do another one and then we did and then he was hosting another one and halfway through I was
[151.54 --> 159.78]  just like I think we're creating more pressure and more tension with me standing here and like
[159.78 --> 165.48]  trying to help you through this as opposed to helping so new plan you're gonna help co-host the
[165.48 --> 169.14]  WAN show get a little bit more comfortable on camera and we're gonna go from there so we got a
[169.14 --> 174.60]  lot of great topics for you guys this week what do you got what's your top picks for topics um so
[174.60 --> 182.68]  AMD did really well yes oh oh I didn't and now I wish that I really didn't sorry what do you got
[182.68 --> 191.12]  um AMD they have 64 core epic processors you might say they're don't don't oh
[191.12 --> 195.38]  that's like two in a row that are brutal
[195.38 --> 201.26]  and oh I don't even see it here but there was more news about AMD that's just
[201.26 --> 207.88]  not great what news was that well they that's not embargoed is it that's not something like
[207.88 --> 216.12]  we're working on that you overheard like me and Anthony discussing is it um no oh okay as long as
[216.12 --> 219.88]  you can find an article that you can say throw that in the doc and we'll pull it up later but the
[219.88 --> 228.44]  rumors around AMD's Radeon RX 590 don't look particularly promising what does look promising is Samsung's
[228.44 --> 234.56]  promise to unveil flexible display phones moving forward we'll be talking talking about that a little bit and
[234.56 --> 239.32]  uh this doesn't look promising this is actually just more annoying than anything else Apple is apparently
[239.32 --> 245.46]  blocking Linux installs on computers equipped with their latest T2 security check what are they trying to secure
[245.46 --> 250.86]  at this point okay sorry we'll discuss it in more detail later first the intro
[250.86 --> 261.18]  it works sometimes it's still just always a surprise though we really need to update it
[261.18 --> 266.84]  it's so old like this intro was created back when we sat on a couch
[266.84 --> 269.70]  yeah
[269.70 --> 274.48]  yeah we used to sit on a couch that looks just like that
[274.48 --> 281.08]  we even had like a little red cushion then that cushion and by the time we got rid of that couch
[281.08 --> 287.82]  it was disgusting because there would be times when we'd be hosting the WAN show on like a pretty
[287.82 --> 294.08]  warm afternoon um the old office didn't have air conditioning and like even this one being out here
[294.08 --> 298.40]  in the warehouse during the summer like it it didn't have air conditioning until the very end of the
[298.40 --> 301.44]  summer this year we actually never got to turn it on I don't think you know we have air conditioning
[301.44 --> 306.22]  out here now right oh I didn't know that yeah look there's one unit here and then there's one over on
[306.22 --> 310.36]  the other side uh the crappy air conditioning installers are the reason that our roof leaks
[310.36 --> 316.74]  right now oh I was kind of wondering what caused that yeah so you know fix one problem create another
[316.74 --> 323.60]  that's life for you right um so anyway that that cushion I would usually put it behind me because the
[323.60 --> 330.32]  Ikea couch that we bought for the WAN show was sort of like not really the right proportions for me
[330.32 --> 336.20]  like the the cushions were just not comfortable for my okay I was being kind I was being kind so
[336.20 --> 340.84]  maybe they're not comfortable for anyone because Alex doesn't look like it right now because he's
[340.84 --> 345.68]  slouching a lot and it's the chair maybe it's more in his legs but he's a lot taller than me
[345.68 --> 349.90]  so if it doesn't work for me and it doesn't work for you it probably doesn't work for most people
[349.90 --> 357.42]  so I would always have this cushion behind me and I'm a bit of a back sweater so that cushion was
[357.42 --> 364.86]  never washed and for literally years once a week I would I would soak back sweat into it so it had
[364.86 --> 372.20]  like this kind of you know that musky smell that like attracts the ladies no not that kind of mask
[372.20 --> 381.14]  no the really gross mask um Luke's out this week for those of you who are asking thank you for asking
[381.14 --> 387.42]  let's appreciate let's appreciate new new Luke because James is new Luke so you don't get to be
[387.42 --> 392.28]  new Luke you're like you can be new James except that I think you were hired at the same time
[392.28 --> 400.40]  um all right what topic do you want to jump into you want to talk about AMD's 64 core epic processors
[400.40 --> 409.92]  uh sure they're 64 cores seven nanometer awesome uh and this is why you were kicked off tech linked
[409.92 --> 419.12]  so AMD is really really turning the turning the what are they what are they called thumb screws yeah
[419.12 --> 424.36]  turning the thumb screws on intel that that's a torture device thumb screws no not that kind of
[424.36 --> 430.16]  thumb screws they just go in your case no no thumb screws are a thing hold on a minute
[430.16 --> 437.00]  no no we're gonna use my screen to google it because okay thumb screws uh torture
[437.00 --> 445.92]  okay thumb screw torture thank you thumb screw there you go oh that looks horrible yeah I really
[445.92 --> 451.18]  don't want that on my thumbs so it's bad so you twist you put the thumbs in there is my understanding
[451.18 --> 457.72]  actually here this one looks pretty brutal and then you you twist this thing a wing nut and it uh I
[457.72 --> 464.08]  think just like shatters the bones in your thumb um simple vice with protruding studs victims thumbs
[464.08 --> 472.66]  fingers or toes replaced in the vice and slowly crushed um so uh that's what AMD is doing to intel
[472.66 --> 479.50]  basically putting a lot of pressure on them right now to figure out how to respond to the onslaught
[479.50 --> 485.32]  because last year with the launch of their Ryzen processors and the launch of their epic processors
[485.32 --> 495.78]  AMD got competitive now it's starting to look a little more interesting it's not like it's not like
[495.78 --> 502.42]  watching an exciting horse race where you know which horse is gonna win but the other one is giving her the
[502.42 --> 509.12]  old college try this is like watching a race where sometimes horse one wins and sometimes horse two wins
[509.12 --> 518.72]  um so with zen 2 we are expecting to see ipc improvements to the desktop chips meanwhile intel
[518.72 --> 524.20]  hasn't managed to do anything other than bump core counts in the last couple of years and on the
[524.20 --> 528.10]  server side of things because remember this is where the big money is made this is where intel has
[528.10 --> 534.50]  products in their lineup that cost anywhere between two thousand to ten thousand dollars per chip and we
[534.50 --> 540.28]  talk about like expensive consumer cpus like when you're reviewing a laptop and i say okay it's got a
[540.28 --> 551.98]  500 or 500 hq uh excuse me hk processor in it yeah you're going that's not a whole lot sometimes but in this
[551.98 --> 559.60]  a lot i think typically you would say that's expensive yeah okay i don't know it depends you usually whine
[559.60 --> 566.36]  about them well yeah but that's not only because they're not cooled okay yes oh okay so in those
[566.36 --> 572.16]  cases you're paying the extra for it and you aren't getting extra performance because they run really
[572.16 --> 578.42]  quite warm and they end up throttling um but anyway so in the context of something like a 1500 laptop
[578.42 --> 586.98]  a 500 cpu is really expensive in the context of a server you know you could easily spend thousands of
[586.98 --> 594.84]  dollars on a cpu like they kind of start where the high-end consumer level chips end and the craziest
[594.84 --> 604.66]  thing about it is we're not talking you know alex clark and his one laptop and one desktop or linus
[604.66 --> 612.36]  sebastian his one laptop and handful of desktops we're talking gigantic data centers like what was that
[612.36 --> 618.68]  place you checked out how many cpus did they have that um 6 000 at ligo at ligo right and so was that
[618.68 --> 626.62]  6 000 cpus or 6 000 boxes with two cpus each um i don't remember exactly but it was a whole bunch of
[626.62 --> 633.34]  blade servers that were set up with a bunch of zeons in them like i think they had a bunch of 24 and 16
[633.34 --> 640.48]  core processors so in an installation like that yeah 24 and 16 core processors so in an installation like
[640.48 --> 650.08]  that all of a sudden amd is now competitive in the lucrative data center market and with epic
[650.08 --> 658.32]  i don't think anyone even amd really expected their epic processors to come in and like immediately
[658.32 --> 663.12]  steal half of intel's market share because the reality of it is that the data center market doesn't
[663.12 --> 671.50]  move that quickly the way that these products get validated is over a much longer period of time and
[671.50 --> 677.58]  the planning that goes on for these kinds of installations just means that even if amd had
[677.58 --> 685.44]  the world's best supercomputer processor today it is unlikely you'd actually see the like an actual
[685.44 --> 692.58]  supercomputer built with them for another 12 18 or even 24 months that's the way that it works for
[692.58 --> 699.86]  those kinds of things so amd got competitive when they launched epic and when they launched ryzen
[699.86 --> 709.62]  now they're saying zen 3 and zen 4 are on track they demonstrated a 7 nanometer epic rome codename rome
[709.62 --> 719.08]  processor with 64 cores and they've had some time for the industry to get used to the idea that they might
[719.08 --> 727.36]  want to plan on using amd for these installations so you have to have the jab and the hook so the first one was the jab
[727.36 --> 733.24]  hey by the way we're here pay attention to us this is the hey you've got us in the back of your mind hey guess what
[733.24 --> 739.08]  it gets even better boom 64 core processor oh by the way did we mention we're cheaper oh by the way did we mention
[739.08 --> 744.52]  that we support these massive amounts of memory oh by the way remember all those pci express lanes that we have and our
[744.52 --> 750.42]  competitor doesn't they're still there and then like i think that the real like deadpool like crotch to the
[750.42 --> 757.54]  face is the fact that it's also infinitely scalable like they can just as intel would say just glue on
[757.54 --> 764.64]  the course and just keep on doing it there was such a there was such a jelly vibe from that jab from intel
[764.64 --> 768.88]  when they were talking about amd gluing cores together yes okay technically gluing cores together
[768.88 --> 775.10]  is a more technical term than it sounds like but it's still it just had this like it had this salty
[775.10 --> 781.58]  vibe to it that they were just like kind of petulant about it like well their core their cpus aren't real
[781.58 --> 787.96]  because they're just they just got toothpicks and and bottle caps and glue and they put them together
[787.96 --> 794.12]  like that well they still are working pretty well so watch out in this context i think it makes a lot of
[794.12 --> 800.72]  sense because right now intel is also just like putting two cpus on a board yeah so that was on
[800.72 --> 809.28]  just monday that intel announced their 48 core xeon which appears to be two cpus on like a on a
[809.28 --> 813.56]  substrate is that is that what it looked like or i think so yeah you'll have to it's not a ton of
[813.56 --> 818.44]  details in our notes i actually didn't look that closely at it because it requires a new socket
[818.44 --> 826.64]  um i think it has like 12 channel memory but it's my understanding again don't quote me on this
[826.64 --> 832.76]  uh i might as well just look it up 48 core xeon but my understanding is it has 12 channel memory in
[832.76 --> 838.36]  big quotes uh multi-chip package yeah here it is okay so original article then is from a non-tech and
[838.36 --> 845.40]  i'm basically going to read it with you guys here scaling up to 48 cores per cpu oh no no no oh what
[845.40 --> 851.40]  where did that mute button go oh wow wow i'm sorry everyone there we go battlefield 5
[851.40 --> 859.14]  blah blah blah yep here we go typical oh no that's a four socket something or other okay two socket
[859.14 --> 865.84]  system until yeah here we go so yeah technically there's these 12 memory channels but that's just
[865.84 --> 870.66]  because we are basically looking at two cpus on a single package and then this is where it gets
[870.66 --> 877.88]  really crazy these things get a new socket that is going to have uh hold on oh wow current 24 core
[877.88 --> 884.44]  uh platinum runs at 205 watts we don't know what frequency they're going to run at 24 cores per die
[884.44 --> 894.46]  oh wow pcie lanes oh wait okay so pcie lanes anywhere between 48 24 per die or 96 48 per die which
[894.46 --> 900.64]  again would be identical to just running four cpus in a quad socket board i'm trying to find
[900.64 --> 910.02]  the memory channels bit just it's just nuts i wish i could find the socket socket server 12 ddr channel
[910.02 --> 915.22]  wow that ad played again as i scrolled back up whatever it doesn't really matter the point is this
[915.22 --> 923.60]  thing is redonkulous and amd instead of launching like a new platform so new socket new chipset weird cpus
[923.60 --> 929.58]  that are like actually more literally glued together amd is refreshing an existing socket
[929.58 --> 936.32]  which like i said in the data center space in the enterprise space matters because these kinds of
[936.32 --> 944.16]  deployments take time to plan and just because they plan things over a long period of time doesn't mean
[944.16 --> 950.18]  that they can't leverage the most up-to-date components if the supplier has a roadmap that makes
[950.18 --> 958.18]  any sense so if amd says okay look here's our epic platform i still kind of called it that here's our
[958.18 --> 967.92]  epic platform epyc here's our epic platform here's the servers that are based on this oh hey we're a
[967.92 --> 973.20]  month from your deployment you haven't actually cut your po yet by the way we just doubled the core
[973.20 --> 977.80]  count or we have a higher frequency part that it's at the same price in the same tdp
[977.80 --> 985.04]  go ahead and chuck those in instead great whereas when you're rolling out an all new platform well
[985.04 --> 991.08]  that that throws a complete wrench you can't just swap that into a deployment it doesn't work that way
[991.08 --> 999.00]  so amd looks to be firing on all cylinders right now and intel is still
[999.00 --> 1006.14]  yeah and it's already on what amazon web services and 10 percent cheaper than intel based solutions
[1006.14 --> 1015.78]  and while we're at it i guess amd announces the radeon instinct which seems like it should be
[1015.78 --> 1019.54]  awesome but i think it's mostly for blockchain and cryptocurrency
[1019.54 --> 1029.98]  so the instinct mi60 and the mi50 so these are aimed at the enterprise accelerator market with amd
[1029.98 --> 1035.68]  looking to significantly improve their performance competitiveness in everything from hpc to machine
[1035.68 --> 1041.52]  learning so these would be the kinds of things that they would do at sfu's um super computers so
[1041.52 --> 1047.94]  researchers who are working on um oh man i forget what some of the examples of things that they were
[1047.94 --> 1055.40]  doing there were but things like simulation um like processing gigantic data sets um those can be
[1055.40 --> 1061.32]  accelerated by gpu compute i what's the biology stuff that they do um sequencing
[1061.32 --> 1067.82]  yep that kind of thing uh i mean we're we're just kind of guessing that's just what that space does
[1067.82 --> 1073.98]  i don't know how much market share amd actually gained with their initial instinct processors but
[1073.98 --> 1081.20]  these look like uh an improvement so they've got support for half rate double precision up from 1 16th rate
[1081.20 --> 1087.18]  so they've got uh so this is especially useful for machine learning inferencing where high precision isn't necessary
[1087.18 --> 1092.66]  okay oh no they have new low precision data types that's useful for machine learning inferencing where
[1092.66 --> 1096.90]  high precision isn't necessary and they're also able to get up to four times the performance
[1096.90 --> 1104.50]  of an fp16 data type when using the smallest in four days okay okay so basically they've got some new
[1104.50 --> 1114.96]  some new modes that they operate in pretty much peak throughput of 7.4 teraflops fp64 14.7 fp32
[1114.96 --> 1122.72]  so okay neat yeah i mean this is the kind of thing that won't have a lot of relevance to you and me
[1122.72 --> 1130.58]  necessarily at least if the rumors on the street are to be believed with respect to amd's consumer gpus
[1130.58 --> 1138.30]  so the original article is from wcc f tech so we'll have to take it with the grain of salt that
[1138.30 --> 1143.38]  people seem to think we should take it with from my experience their rumor stuff isn't really any worse
[1143.38 --> 1151.94]  than anyone else's rumor stuff like is it i don't know um but apparently their third polaris gpu revision
[1151.94 --> 1160.44]  is coming and it's going to be called the rx 590 so wow it looks like they've even gotten
[1160.44 --> 1168.24]  their hands on the amd confidential nda required under embargo until oh there's this thing there
[1168.24 --> 1173.96]  that says comments i can't see what's under embargo till but uh this looks like an official amd slide deck
[1173.96 --> 1179.90]  um i don't even know why they bother having embargoes at this point
[1179.90 --> 1187.20]  well i don't even know why they bother calling it something new at this point making this gpu
[1187.20 --> 1200.04]  if if the rumors are true um it has um be based on 2304 cores compared to the radeon rx 580s 200
[1200.04 --> 1208.94]  or 2304 cores yep so that's same number of course how much ram does it have eight gigabytes compared to
[1208.94 --> 1219.40]  the eight gigabytes okay the bus width is 556 bit compared to 556 okay and the name is 590 though
[1219.40 --> 1224.42]  that's that's a change that's a change that's an improvement and it's slightly higher clocked
[1224.42 --> 1232.36]  okay so so what we don't know right now because we can see on that main title slide um latest
[1232.36 --> 1242.24]  generation finfet 12 that it could be going from 14 nanometer to 12 nanometer sort of because if it
[1242.24 --> 1248.34]  uses tsmc's 12 nanometer process that might actually be an improvement to power characteristics
[1248.34 --> 1256.22]  and performance if it uses global foundry's 12 nanometer that's actually based very closely
[1256.22 --> 1263.50]  like i it might even be a little disingenuous to call it 12 nanometer compared to the 14 nanometer
[1263.50 --> 1273.58]  process that amd was already using on the rx 580 so um do they have actually do they have leaked
[1273.58 --> 1282.30]  die sizes here at all uh no because that might tell us something interesting no they don't so what we
[1282.30 --> 1287.28]  don't know is if this 12 nanometer shrink is just giving us some better power efficiency actually do
[1287.28 --> 1294.54]  they have rated power power draw no no nothing leaked in power draw either so it's possible that
[1294.54 --> 1301.30]  these are just overclocked but i mean really this was all amd could come up with uh to say to sell this
[1301.30 --> 1308.44]  thing latest generation finfet 12 which quite frankly in my personal opinion should not be a selling
[1308.44 --> 1317.36]  feature that you put in front of a consumer does that seem fair yeah why does my cousin care what
[1317.36 --> 1325.46]  finfet process you're using he's not going to what matters is how many fps how many dollars i pay
[1325.46 --> 1333.80]  what cool features it has like you know um automatic you know gameplay recording or special anti-aliasing
[1333.80 --> 1339.32]  modes or whatever the case may be or drivers that work yeah how many finfets it has doesn't matter
[1339.32 --> 1346.52]  okay selling point number two aggressive tuning for higher clocks so we already have that graphics card
[1346.52 --> 1357.42]  that's called the rx 580 oc okay enhanced idle and multi-monitor efficiency that is a driver improvement
[1357.42 --> 1366.96]  and finally expanded options and robust partner designs so basically they're saying they're not
[1366.96 --> 1374.40]  making a reference card is that what that sounds like to you yeah because that's what that sounds
[1374.40 --> 1382.32]  like to me all right so i'm not impressed expected pricing is 250 to 300 us what was the 580 right around
[1382.32 --> 1388.06]  there i think they should just call it the 580 x and then we would be like awesome they made a faster
[1388.06 --> 1395.86]  580 good job guys instead of being like it's a 580 but now we're mad you know that is a really good
[1395.86 --> 1402.18]  point and it's actually not a video about an amd product but we do have a video coming up about a
[1402.18 --> 1406.60]  product that is currently embargoed so i can't say what it is unfortunately which is really frustrating
[1406.60 --> 1412.80]  because it would make this story more interesting but basically we've got a product that we've got our
[1412.80 --> 1422.12]  hands on already and we've been testing and the manufacturer refused to disclose to us certain
[1422.12 --> 1429.36]  aspects of the specifications of the device and here's the stupid thing about it
[1429.36 --> 1444.32]  it makes me feel kind of disrespected yeah like we have it we have it in our hands and we can measure
[1444.32 --> 1453.80]  these characteristics it's not particularly complicated to do so so they're either disrespecting
[1453.80 --> 1459.68]  our competence because they don't think that if they don't tell us we'll be able to put two and two
[1459.68 --> 1468.26]  together here or they are disrespecting our time because now we have to invest time to measure something
[1468.26 --> 1476.60]  that they could have simply provided on a spreadsheet or they are disrespecting our thoroughness because
[1476.60 --> 1483.40]  they don't think that we're gonna bother to talk about this like there's no way that i can slice
[1483.40 --> 1489.88]  this and feel respected maybe they're disrespecting our viewers that's another way because they don't
[1489.88 --> 1496.02]  seem to think that they need the full story so why make it any easier to get there like can you come up
[1496.02 --> 1503.04]  with a way that not providing some spec of your product is respectful to your partners because that's what
[1503.04 --> 1512.60]  the media are no i can't and it's just it's just baffling and that's what i honestly that's what i feel
[1512.60 --> 1519.60]  like a lot of these kinds of skews um whether the 590 turns out to be what it looks like it might be
[1519.60 --> 1527.16]  which is just a rehash of the 580 but like maybe from a different supplier depending on what manufacturer
[1527.16 --> 1531.92]  they're using for the chips um and this other thing that i'm talking about it just like these these
[1531.92 --> 1538.82]  rebrands it just feels like why even bother then why even seed us a unit why not just say outright
[1538.82 --> 1544.00]  we are trying to mislead the general consumer into thinking this is something new when it isn't
[1544.00 --> 1549.62]  actually do you think they're doing the 590 because they did the 580 whatever sp the
[1549.62 --> 1557.02]  they rebranded the 570 to be a 580 i really don't like what amd is doing on their gpu side like i
[1557.02 --> 1563.18]  understand why they're doing it they're doing it because they got nothing it's like it's very obvious
[1563.18 --> 1569.04]  they just they got nothing and nvidia has new stuff that they are obviously planning to roll out
[1569.04 --> 1574.70]  and amd's like well that's the way it works like when your competitor launches something you got to
[1574.70 --> 1578.40]  launch something so if we can't launch something new i guess we'll launch what we already got
[1578.40 --> 1585.02]  um and they already did that with the with the 580 but at least they called it something different
[1585.02 --> 1589.18]  no that's what they're doing again they're just calling it something different
[1589.18 --> 1594.80]  no the 580 did i okay my understanding is the 580 was a different die even though it was only
[1594.80 --> 1604.64]  slightly slightly optimized okay so actually okay 480 all right all right 2304 590 same thing
[1604.64 --> 1612.26]  oh wait when is the last time amd launched a new graphics card well they did vega but
[1612.26 --> 1620.34]  yeah they don't exist really do they not like can you buy a vega 56 on new egg like you couldn't
[1620.34 --> 1626.18]  during the whole mining thing like they were impossible to get but i don't really know why
[1626.18 --> 1635.04]  you would like you can get them in an imac pro yeah okay there's an azrock there's an azrock
[1635.04 --> 1643.42]  reference card on new egg uh there's a power color mini that's pretty cool or nano rather oh cool
[1643.42 --> 1650.22]  um okay yeah there's a handful of vega 56 is in stock but then okay let's take a pretty well-known
[1650.22 --> 1660.94]  brand like xfx you could make the argument xfx is kind of too amd what evga is to nvidia at least you
[1660.94 --> 1664.72]  used to be able to they used to have like a lifetime warranty and stuff actually i don't think
[1664.72 --> 1670.98]  they do anymore anyway let's take some brand xfx and let's try to buy 10 of these and let's update
[1670.98 --> 1676.90]  our cart um how do you update your cart update quantities and it's looking like that you know
[1676.90 --> 1682.42]  what 70s are considerably cheaper they've got uh no they've got 10 in stock though so apparently
[1682.42 --> 1689.24]  no they've got okay new egg used to correct you like like here let's see because there's no way
[1689.24 --> 1695.42]  they have like 50 of these things yeah okay they have 49 of these in stock so apparently they're
[1695.42 --> 1701.54]  actually selling all right maybe we didn't give rx vega enough credit or maybe they have 49 in stock
[1701.54 --> 1706.82]  because they can't figure out how to get rid of them i don't know the point is i don't like what amd
[1706.82 --> 1711.92]  is doing on the graphic side of things but uh at the end of the day as long as they're kicking ass
[1711.92 --> 1718.06]  on one side of the business then it seems like they can keep surviving because for a while there it was
[1718.06 --> 1725.00]  graphics that was keeping them alive and they're like okay you guys just just please just carry us
[1725.00 --> 1730.30]  deadweight cpu guys until we can until we can get zen out and then and then you can rest
[1730.30 --> 1741.18]  um all right okay so apple blocking linux installs why would they do this yeah i just don't get it
[1741.18 --> 1748.34]  who cares like okay so the source was gito 463 on the forum the original article here is from the
[1748.34 --> 1755.26]  register okay walk us through this what is going on here i have no idea and i don't understand why it
[1755.26 --> 1763.86]  would happen so they're blocking linux that's all that i know i really felt like this article was
[1763.86 --> 1776.32]  addressed to me personally and i um i realize now it's the other linux oh yes it's like whoa what
[1776.32 --> 1781.08]  because i was actually like seriously considering the macbook air until i realized that it doesn't
[1781.08 --> 1787.62]  have the quad core eighth gen processors which was i know to me um actually our macbook air is not
[1787.62 --> 1791.80]  going to arrive till tuesday so you guys are going to have to wait for our content on the macbook air but
[1791.80 --> 1797.16]  i was so amped on this thing because i didn't watch the keynote or attend the event i just got
[1797.16 --> 1802.06]  excited because like apple was finally launching a new macbook air and i was like alex because he
[1802.06 --> 1806.60]  wanted to do the review yeah i wanted it really bad because i thought the same thing and then i was
[1806.60 --> 1811.04]  like alex i don't think you're gonna get to do it because i think i might even use it as a daily
[1811.04 --> 1816.40]  driver like i'm gonna boot camp it and i'm gonna you know what i'm gonna give mac os a shot because
[1816.40 --> 1822.32]  i do every once in a while and um then he gets he replies to me i think this is on the hangouts or
[1822.32 --> 1828.76]  something yeah it's just like it's a dual core and i was like no no no it's eighth gen sure eighth
[1828.76 --> 1835.20]  gen core i7 surely they have a quad core option and no yeah we just found the stuff it's like why
[1835.20 --> 1842.84]  like everything like not not this surface it's got all the thunderbolt ports and it's all sexy and
[1842.84 --> 1848.58]  it's got the battery life it could have finally just been we could have finally had the laptop
[1848.58 --> 1855.30]  we're both waiting for because like you're on the surface laptop and here you know what this is
[1855.30 --> 1864.04]  awesome 30 second review of that go okay best keyboard best screen because it's 4x3 overall just
[1864.04 --> 1869.38]  generally awesome no thunderbolt sucks okay like i'm not plugged in right now because
[1869.38 --> 1878.64]  no no way no can't do it right you'd need a display port to hdmi adapter okay here i go with
[1878.64 --> 1884.96]  the razor blade stealth pretty good build quality pretty good keyboard nice big trackpad could be
[1884.96 --> 1894.02]  bigger okay display it's fine i guess has thunderbolt so e gpu very nice mediocre battery
[1894.02 --> 1900.24]  life and i don't like the keyboard at all and he doesn't like the keyboard at all so we're both
[1900.24 --> 1907.06]  kind of waiting for something to be perfect and people are probably yelling right now that the
[1907.06 --> 1915.20]  dell xps 13 has all of that but i just don't like it yeah i don't know like i just kind of open it up
[1915.20 --> 1920.14]  and the screen's really small and you can only get like the 4k one and then everything's really
[1920.14 --> 1926.54]  crammed or you don't get touch and honestly 4k displays on a screen that size make no sense
[1926.54 --> 1934.16]  because once you start scaling windows like 250 percent stuff does look kind of stupid like i and i
[1934.16 --> 1941.30]  know that that's an aesthetic quibble and that's maybe not legitimate or whatever but either of us
[1941.30 --> 1947.72]  could use an xps 13 and we don't so deal with it um oh people are saying the gram build quality's
[1947.72 --> 1954.42]  trash yeah well it's not trash not on all of them pretty good we don't like the 15 yeah but the 13
[1954.42 --> 1959.76]  doesn't have thunderbolt and the 13 doesn't have thunderbolt see this is a problem you know what
[1959.76 --> 1965.36]  though that new hp envy that new the x360 that we looked at in the writers meeting are we getting
[1965.36 --> 1972.22]  one i'm not sure okay tell you what let's just buy one if we can't get one all right okay so let's let's
[1972.22 --> 1977.74]  get one of those because do we agree that one looks promising it does yeah if the battery life is on point
[1977.74 --> 1983.60]  and the build quality i i have yet to encounter an hp laptop keyboard that has lit a fire in my soul
[1983.60 --> 1989.38]  though that's the one thing i'm really worried about because for better like for better or for worse
[1989.38 --> 1996.28]  you can make an amazing laptop you can make the perfect laptop and if it doesn't have a decent
[1996.28 --> 2000.14]  screen you will never sell it to either of the people sitting behind this desk right now
[2000.14 --> 2005.70]  did i say screen keyboard you did say screen yeah keyboard for me is the main thing keyboard
[2005.70 --> 2012.48]  is key and touch screen i can't just use like a non-touch screen anymore
[2012.48 --> 2022.68]  keyboard keyboard is key i was just trying to go past that come on i guess that the macbook doesn't
[2022.68 --> 2030.86]  have a touch screen but yeah actually touch screen is kind of a big deal to me too all right like one
[2030.86 --> 2036.54]  thing that we do do a lot that people probably don't know is the like teleprompter like the ghetto
[2036.54 --> 2042.78]  one where you know right we'll be you're kind of reflecting but yeah so we'll literally be like
[2042.78 --> 2048.20]  on location somewhere where's the last place that you and i did together um i'm thinking of general
[2048.20 --> 2054.38]  fusion but i know we've done one since did we do that before or after the uh the trip down to spacex
[2054.38 --> 2061.86]  um i don't remember i think we had a prompter at spacex yeah we did yeah anyway ces um you know
[2061.86 --> 2065.84]  what we're gonna have to get back to this because we haven't done our sponsors for the show yet oh goodness
[2065.84 --> 2076.66]  uh sponsor number one is be quiet oh wow um oh god um this is complicated so uh i'm just gonna sit
[2076.66 --> 2088.62]  back hold on yeah sure this is ah the silent base 801 oh i just pulled the filter off the front no no
[2088.62 --> 2094.58]  wait you're gonna hit the mic okay right there okay i'm gonna put that filter back did i put it back
[2094.58 --> 2099.04]  right oh good okay cool you know i really like it's really back it's backwards so don't hit the
[2099.04 --> 2104.46]  mic don't hit the mic that will hurt everyone oh goodness dang it okay we're turning it the wrong
[2104.46 --> 2108.54]  way yeah i know right it's backwards okay tell you what here you take the side panel off
[2108.54 --> 2119.28]  okay this is okay this is really easy i swear when like linus isn't holding it
[2119.28 --> 2128.60]  what are you doing okay let's try that let's try that again meanwhile be quiet's watching this they're
[2128.60 --> 2135.56]  just like really you guys there oh okay got your acoustic dampening stuff in there trust me it's in
[2135.56 --> 2140.42]  there i can't see that's fine anyway that's the back panel so you got your ssd mounts you got
[2140.42 --> 2145.96]  really nice built-in fan control which is awesome uh these are interesting but from the other side so
[2145.96 --> 2150.98]  you can kind of use them to route cables from over here or from the other side what's neat is that you
[2150.98 --> 2155.98]  can install all the three and a half inch hard drives you want or leave it completely blank it's
[2155.98 --> 2161.04]  totally up to you so there's three ssd mounts back there um moving around to the front is this
[2161.04 --> 2166.70]  literally the case that we used for that build or is this the second one oh no different case
[2166.70 --> 2171.54]  oh okay the same case but the same one yeah okay so we actually have a build coming in this where
[2171.54 --> 2177.08]  we're going to do like the fastest gaming pc tempered glass side panel of course the year is 2018 you
[2177.08 --> 2184.08]  got to have that included pure wings fans i believe it's three of them yep two in the front one in the
[2184.08 --> 2188.88]  back uh you've also got these are those three and a half inch cages that you can install all up and
[2188.88 --> 2194.70]  down here um really nice clean basement here so you don't have to see here can you hold that for
[2194.70 --> 2199.44]  a second so you don't have to see your power supply wires or anything like that like it's really easy
[2199.44 --> 2207.16]  and really quick to do a nice clean build in it i have no idea what be quiet's talking points were for
[2207.16 --> 2213.78]  this thing so you know we must have got them we probably missed a handful of them but it is what it
[2213.78 --> 2222.54]  is at this point oh goodness and that was the last time be quiet ever worked with us freshbooks
[2222.54 --> 2227.98]  freshbooks is the super simple to use invoicing tool that actually does a lot more than help you
[2227.98 --> 2232.44]  create and send slick looking invoices it helps you track your time with their timesheet function
[2232.44 --> 2236.30]  manage your expenses and keep track of who owes you what it also has a feature that tells you when

[2253.80 --> 2261.60]  in the how did you hear about us section and finally savage jerky oh yes sriracha teriyaki i was i was
[2261.60 --> 2267.82]  taking that no well okay hold on a second we've got reaper i'm going for the sriracha bacon
[2267.82 --> 2276.20]  all right what a wuss all right i'm gonna have some sriracha teriyaki savage jerky it's made with high
[2276.20 --> 2282.70]  quality ingredients without nitrates or preservatives their goal was to create a snack that was full of
[2282.70 --> 2288.12]  flavor and spice but that isn't bad for you they've got 13 different flavors of jerky like the sriracha
[2288.12 --> 2293.64]  bacon and maple buffalo bacon which is my personal favorite they also make barbecue sauce hot sauce
[2293.64 --> 2298.08]  and a spice rub i haven't actually tried the spice rub or the barbecue sauce but i've tried the hot
[2298.08 --> 2303.46]  sauce it is delicious and their carolina reaper hot sauce uses one of the hottest peppers in the world
[2303.46 --> 2304.80]  the
[2304.80 --> 2314.56]  elephant weighing pepper just kidding it what carolina reaper pepper obviously yeah anyway you can use
[2314.56 --> 2319.04]  offer code linus to save 10 on all their products no it's not made of elephant weighing pepper no but
[2319.04 --> 2325.06]  i just kind of want to try it now it's hot have you never tried it i think that i did and it was
[2325.06 --> 2331.80]  unpleasant yeah it's not like it tasted really good but it was like oh it's it burns it's burning
[2331.80 --> 2339.26]  like it burns not just when you pee you know like just burns yeah it doesn't actually burn there
[2339.26 --> 2345.30]  i tried it before and i was like wow that was really great and then like 20 seconds later i was just
[2345.30 --> 2352.62]  like but i don't know let's just do it again all right so this is this is in my mouth
[2352.62 --> 2355.74]  mm-hmm not too bad yet did you put the whole thing in yeah
[2355.74 --> 2362.42]  all right well stay tuned for the sweat breaking out on his brow over the course of the next time no
[2362.42 --> 2369.58]  you don't get to take your drink already all right so right now it's pleasant but like we're
[2369.58 --> 2375.74]  getting there back to apple blocking linux install so their t2 security chip is blocking linux from
[2375.74 --> 2382.26]  booting on mac devices and the t2 security chip the way it was sold to us anyway is supposed to be about
[2382.26 --> 2388.36]  encrypting your data so that if someone steals your device so if someone steals your device they can't get
[2388.36 --> 2395.50]  at it um but instead it looks like the new macbook air and mac mini that both come with the t2 chip
[2395.50 --> 2407.38]  embedded are going to yes okay whatever so the the latest iMac pro the latest macbook pro so the new
[2407.38 --> 2412.34]  macbook air the mac mini any of the devices that apple makes that come with the t2 chip embedded
[2412.34 --> 2417.52]  they're going to have a secure enclave they're going to have apfs storage encryption touch id handling
[2417.52 --> 2424.28]  a hardware microphone disconnect on lid clothes and other security features but the t2 chip also
[2424.28 --> 2432.16]  restricts the boot process and it means that linux support on mac hardware is now not just bad or
[2432.16 --> 2440.24]  inconvenient it is non-existent by default even windows isn't bootable until you enable support
[2440.24 --> 2446.84]  for windows via the boot camp assistant on mac os wow so what this will do is install the windows
[2446.84 --> 2451.96]  production ca 2011 certificate that's used to authenticate microsoft bootloaders but it doesn't
[2451.96 --> 2456.04]  set up the microsoft approved uefi certificate that allows verification of code by microsoft partners
[2456.04 --> 2461.42]  so even when the secure boot functionality has been disabled the t2 chip is reportedly still blocking
[2461.42 --> 2464.60]  operating systems aside from mac os and windows 10 specifically
[2464.60 --> 2473.64]  i really like this headline that they have here where it's just t2 more like terminator 2 is this a
[2473.64 --> 2474.12]  register
[2474.12 --> 2484.36]  but like i know so many programmers that use macbooks and macbook airs all the time and all of them use
[2484.36 --> 2489.80]  linux on it like they never use mac os or like sometimes they do but a lot of them just use linux so i have
[2489.80 --> 2498.68]  no clue why they would do this i mean there's the obvious sort of snarky argument well why are you
[2498.68 --> 2504.12]  buying a macbook if you don't want to run mac os and i can come up with some pretty easy answers to
[2504.12 --> 2511.48]  that maybe you don't want to run mac os all the time and also they're just doing your laptops also
[2511.48 --> 2516.68]  they're just pretty nice hardware and here's another thing like people complain a lot about the repair
[2516.68 --> 2521.24]  ability of apple hardware and it is a legitimate complaint we've run into that problem ourselves
[2522.44 --> 2529.48]  however for better or for worse because of the ubiquity of apple hardware even though it's very
[2529.48 --> 2536.60]  difficult to repair finding someone who has gone to the effort of figuring out how to repair it can
[2536.60 --> 2541.24]  actually be easier in some cases do you get what i mean by this and finding spare parts is really easy
[2541.24 --> 2547.24]  too like stuff like power connectors even if it's soldered you can like find a dead one really easy
[2547.24 --> 2553.72]  and then just pew and like we mean really easy and of course a relative sense yeah like my friends in
[2553.72 --> 2559.08]  engineering would make a good buck off of it it's still hard and it's still a hassle and apple could
[2559.08 --> 2568.60]  still support third-party um like service providers a lot better or at all but at least these third-party
[2568.60 --> 2573.56]  service providers keep fighting through and keep finding a way although the t2 chip looks like it
[2573.56 --> 2575.16]  really might kibosh a lot of this
[2577.96 --> 2585.32]  all right um u.s internet traffic routed through china for two plus years yeah we don't have a lot
[2585.32 --> 2590.92]  of time left so yeah and i don't really want to talk about that too much until it's confirmed yeah and
[2590.92 --> 2595.48]  i was like what was the other thing some of these are some of these topics are kind of like duh like
[2595.48 --> 2600.20]  teal ghost posted this on the forum google confirms that dark mode saves battery on android
[2600.20 --> 2607.08]  really like you think anyway the good news is we're finally getting dark mode um samsung is also
[2607.08 --> 2612.92]  planning to add it with their new one ui which is sounds good i hope i don't know when samsung
[2612.92 --> 2618.04]  announces they're doing a new android skin it's like will they make it better will they bung it up
[2619.16 --> 2623.24]  will they finally fix my battery drain issue i had i had it again the other day and now it's
[2623.24 --> 2629.72]  now it's fixed again so actually small ios just really annoying thing you can turn the keyboard
[2629.72 --> 2634.92]  dark but then the area below the keyboard still stays light so it just looks horrible and i can't
[2634.92 --> 2640.36]  deal with it oh yeah you've been using ios for a little while how's that going i don't like it at all
[2641.32 --> 2646.92]  there's just like a couple small things that like i got through the like the initial like not liking it
[2646.92 --> 2650.52]  because i just didn't know how to use it okay have you found some of the beautiful things though
[2651.40 --> 2656.52]  like being able to reposition your cursor with uh 3d touch or force touch or whatever they call it
[2656.52 --> 2660.44]  on the phone no how do you use that it's really because i've been really annoyed with like copying
[2660.44 --> 2663.08]  links yeah so do you have your phone on you yes
[2667.16 --> 2673.64]  this is one of those like i forget how i lived without it every time i go back to the iphone um
[2674.36 --> 2679.88]  so here let's just like type itty type itty type some stuff and if you want to reposition your cursor
[2681.08 --> 2690.28]  oh neat huh i had no clue how to do that yeah so apple does a really good job of some little quality
[2690.28 --> 2696.28]  of life things and i'm at the point now where i think a lot of people assumed from my iphone 10s video
[2696.28 --> 2701.48]  that i hated the iphone or hated the 10s i don't i don't hate it i just don't care about it it's just not
[2701.48 --> 2707.88]  interesting um and quite frankly for me there are things that drive me nuts about both sides like my
[2707.88 --> 2712.28]  google pixel 3 excel review is not going to be particularly positive either and i think i'm just
[2712.28 --> 2718.92]  jaded and tired of phones and so that's why i'm not going to be our main writer for phone videos
[2718.92 --> 2724.04]  anymore because i think i just can't handle it anymore so i'm still going to be like senior editor
[2724.04 --> 2729.80]  but i'm like one of our better received phone videos over the last little while the rog phone
[2729.80 --> 2737.72]  was actually 95 prepared by jake not by me so there you go take that for what it is i just want to like
[2737.72 --> 2743.16]  whinge about a couple more things sure go for it is that the 10s or the yeah yeah that's the 10s right
[2743.16 --> 2751.16]  so i can't put all of my icons down on the bottom so like you you only get four i want five yes in
[2751.16 --> 2756.20]  order to search something i need to go all the way over to the left no no no search is good yeah
[2756.20 --> 2762.60]  here i can fix that for you so you search just by swiping down anywhere no but you still you swipe
[2762.60 --> 2769.88]  down then you have to click on it no it's no it auto populated look i can type see i didn't have to
[2769.88 --> 2774.92]  click it okay so okay they do have some stupid stuff like that though where you'll like i think it's um
[2775.72 --> 2780.12]  when you look up a contact or something i think you have to actually click the stupid text field before
[2780.12 --> 2786.12]  you can start no but you get to it and now i need to click search web and then it opens on safari yeah
[2786.12 --> 2790.84]  yeah yeah okay okay okay whereas like on the pixel you just go over it searches your whole phone
[2790.84 --> 2795.80]  and the web you know it's funny i'm so old it's just right at the bottom like on my other phone
[2795.80 --> 2803.00]  it's right here i'm so old-fashioned that whenever i want to google search i open chrome and then start
[2803.00 --> 2810.84]  typing i literally have maybe twice in my life used even though on a lot of my phones it's just there
[2810.84 --> 2817.08]  by default and i just forget it i just like can't even see it that google bar that's on my home screen
[2817.08 --> 2822.84]  i just i just don't even use it because i'm old and stupid okay it's kind of like jake saw me well but
[2822.84 --> 2829.24]  like i've had that search bar on my phone on the home screen since i had a samsung s2
[2830.68 --> 2835.88]  so like how have you not gotten used to it since then jake it's just i'm just old i'm just old and
[2835.88 --> 2840.84]  stupid so jake saw me trying to pay for something with my credit card with tap the other day and i
[2840.84 --> 2848.52]  took my whole card and i like put it down on the reader and he's like wow you're so old and i'm like
[2848.52 --> 2854.60]  what and he's like well the antenna is right there so you only have to go against it like this
[2854.60 --> 2860.60]  and i'm like okay like yeah i never gave any thought to where the to where the actual nfc or
[2860.60 --> 2866.04]  excuse me rfid element was inside the card and if i had i would have known that yes i only have to put
[2866.04 --> 2873.48]  like i'm not an idiot i know how rfid works but i just never thought about it because i'm old and i just
[2873.48 --> 2878.28]  i always just put it against it and it always just worked so what do i care so i always put it
[2878.28 --> 2881.48]  against it because i did that for a little bit where it's like the end because i kind of felt
[2881.48 --> 2888.20]  cool but it sometimes just it bugs out and i find if you do the whole thing it works more of the time
[2888.20 --> 2892.52]  well there you go i feel validated right now speaking of validation we should probably validate
[2892.52 --> 2898.28]  some of our super chat um oh goodness people because we haven't yet and that's really terrible
[2900.44 --> 2903.32]  um i can't read it's me sad face this highline is keep up the good work
[2903.32 --> 2909.72]  dave says love ltt would love to see that you team up with retro rgb for a retro gaming video
[2909.72 --> 2914.76]  interesting we do have some retro stuff planned so stay tuned for that dark inertia hi
[2916.44 --> 2923.48]  showdown channel super fun video budget gave us five euros believe it or not channel super fun is
[2923.48 --> 2932.36]  still fully funded people are excuse me i'm just eating my jerky hungry um people internally are
[2932.36 --> 2937.88]  allowed to shoot channel super fun if they can find time to do it they're allowed to spend the entire
[2937.88 --> 2942.60]  adsense income from channel super fun on channel super fun which means that over the last six months
[2942.60 --> 2947.72]  where we've done basically nothing there's literally thousands of dollars in a bucket that people could
[2947.72 --> 2954.20]  just spend doing cool stuff if they wanted to okay but i'm just not pushing it that's all do you know
[2954.20 --> 2960.12]  what i really want to do acetylene powered potato cannon i know you want to do that but that i think
[2960.12 --> 2964.92]  is not a particularly amazing idea so they also have no do you realize how dangerous acetylene is
[2964.92 --> 2971.00]  and how great it is in a potato cannon i built one of these before and we had to like wrap it in duct tape
[2971.00 --> 2976.68]  because it kind of exploded and then it like really exploded it was really great
[2980.12 --> 2990.36]  zach carter says it's my birthday happy birthday love your quality content in quotes thank you zach
[2991.32 --> 2998.20]  sirplexer says instead of buying a better cpu i would buy an os made for gaming cutting out the crap
[2998.20 --> 3002.52]  unfortunately that doesn't really exist believe it or not cutting the crap out of your os doesn't
[3002.52 --> 3008.36]  really do much for gaming um in fact we still need to do that follow-up on windows game mode
[3009.32 --> 3016.28]  oh yeah we should do that um laggy says hi linus love your videos will there be an rg rig reboot 2019
[3016.28 --> 3023.08]  oh wow i don't know we haven't even finished 2018 yet yes thank you colton that's the plan um
[3023.08 --> 3032.36]  um evil says where's lucky someone moved him over to 101 uh so i plan to move him back but i had put
[3032.36 --> 3037.96]  him in the in the set there and then yeah i think i think it was brandon i think brandon got rid of him
[3040.68 --> 3045.08]  it's not a waste of 20 minutes of your time if you don't spend 20 minutes moving him brandon
[3045.08 --> 3051.88]  if you just leave him in his home i think it would have been really great in my way i need the space
[3053.00 --> 3056.84]  no but just think about how great it would have been for this razor video to just have him in the
[3056.84 --> 3063.48]  background right just chilling there you know christian says i've watched your content for five
[3063.48 --> 3066.36]  plus years never fails to entertain me awesome
[3068.84 --> 3074.04]  neil says want to show my support thanks neil oh wow there's so many of these leggy tech is back again
[3074.60 --> 3078.28]  oh man laggy tech i'm sorry it was just because i wasn't looking at them yet it wasn't that i like
[3078.28 --> 3083.08]  wasn't going to read your comment i mean sometimes that is it but sending more probably won't help
[3083.96 --> 3092.44]  um see kurosu would i notice any latency going from a tn to ips for gaming so we actually have a video
[3092.44 --> 3098.20]  coming soon that's not really about that um actually yeah it's really not about that at all
[3098.20 --> 3106.68]  i don't know i personally can notice the difference but it's like that's if i have them side by side like
[3106.68 --> 3114.76]  a 144 tn beside a 144 ips you'll notice yeah but a lot of the time i'll just be like oh that ips is
[3114.76 --> 3120.04]  just way better i find the ips advantages more noticeable than the tn advantages but i can certainly
[3120.04 --> 3126.44]  see like if you're like we've got a 240 hertz tn from asus in the office here and like in cs go
[3128.28 --> 3135.96]  like whipping around you can still see detail in like it's amazing on on a wall in dust 2
[3136.60 --> 3142.44]  and it's it's incredible but i would i would take ips over that every time by the way this guy also says
[3142.44 --> 3148.76]  bt dubs alex you're a wonderful addition to the oh why thank you kudos to you linus is okay too i guess
[3150.36 --> 3157.64]  uh kaija keep up the good work thank you um minna desu says don't forget they're not going to make
[3157.64 --> 3161.96]  a 1080 ti anymore i actually didn't know that that kind of makes sense it's just kind of unfortunate
[3161.96 --> 3166.92]  what do you want to come but also whatever we're reading super chats oh perfect here you go what is
[3166.92 --> 3172.20]  this oh folding yes folding's great oh yeah okay people should fold it's folding month so in

[3200.28 --> 3205.48]  yeah those are like the evga ones too and they're like kind of they're pretty juddy
[3207.16 --> 3213.72]  um and koi says the jerky can get spicy here's a beer on me joke's on joke's on you i keep the five
[3213.72 --> 3219.40]  dollars he has to pay for his own beer and also it really wasn't that bad i remember it being a lot
[3219.40 --> 3226.52]  worse really okay yeah i think i sweat a bit but like hello world from hong kong says ken
[3228.04 --> 3233.56]  and i think we're pretty much good nice all right so thanks guys for tuning into the when show we
[3233.56 --> 3237.48]  will see you again next week same bad time same bad channel maybe different bat hosts
[3238.68 --> 3243.00]  we'll see i don't know how do you think alex did let me know in the comments below or in the chat one of
[3243.00 --> 3247.64]  one of these if you think he was terrible you can also let me know if you thought he was good
[3248.68 --> 3253.32]  or just linus's puns were really bad the whole time no thumbs down for that pump no puns were
[3253.96 --> 3260.92]  oh so we uh we talked to youtube's um i forget i forget who they were but thumbs down is apparently
[3260.92 --> 3266.44]  worse for your uh algorithmic relevance than we thought oh so we might stop encouraging people to
[3266.44 --> 3280.44]  thumbs down the video so okay so we'll see how that goes comment yeah that linus was horrible
