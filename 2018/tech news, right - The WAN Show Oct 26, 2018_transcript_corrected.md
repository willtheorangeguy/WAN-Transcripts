[0.76 → 2.74] You know we have a... are we live?
[2.88 → 3.38] Yeah, we're live.
[3.40 → 3.64] Hey.
[3.78 → 4.14] Heck yeah.
[4.32 → 4.58] Yeah.
[4.80 → 5.86] Do I know we have a what?
[6.12 → 7.08] We'll figure it out later.
[7.22 → 7.36] Oh.
[11.18 → 12.74] Is this good news or bad news?
[12.88 → 13.38] Like, what do I...
[13.38 → 13.90] It's good news.
[13.92 → 14.58] What do I have to look forward to here?
[14.58 → 15.42] It's super exciting.
[15.68 → 17.20] We'll get to that later on in the show.
[17.56 → 18.36] It's in the show?
[18.46 → 19.14] It is in the show.
[19.22 → 20.02] But you're not gonna...
[20.02 → 20.36] Nope.
[20.40 → 21.04] What the...
[21.04 → 22.54] We've got awesome topics this week.
[22.54 → 23.54] What is wrong with you?
[23.54 → 29.98] Starting off with Google forces European Android OEMs to pay a licensing fee for Google
[29.98 → 30.48] apps.
[30.62 → 31.64] You're such a jerk.
[32.60 → 34.08] We've got...
[34.08 → 34.60] Is this...
[34.60 → 34.94] What is this?
[34.96 → 35.68] A leaked...
[35.68 → 36.22] Oh, yeah.
[36.30 → 41.72] Samsung revealed their mobile design roadmap, which is focused on burying components under
[41.72 → 44.48] the screen rather than putting them in notches.
[45.02 → 46.60] Thank you, Samsung.
[46.90 → 47.30] Hooray.
[47.40 → 51.10] For being after my heart here because...
[51.10 → 51.76] Oh, man.
[51.88 → 52.46] Thank you.
[52.46 → 52.98] Fantastic.
[53.44 → 59.00] Discord TOS update revokes users' right to sue as a group, as a class action group.
[59.00 → 64.70] And AMD has responded to Intel's ninth-gen benchmarks.
[65.10 → 70.88] They are super thrilled with the original numbers that were posted by Principled Technologies.
[71.52 → 79.98] They love when their processors look like two-thirds as fast as someone else's, when that
[79.98 → 81.06] is not, in fact, the case.
[81.28 → 83.54] So it's a super warm and fuzzy press release.
[83.68 → 85.04] We'll talk a little bit more about that later.
[85.04 → 86.82] For now, let's roll that intro.
[87.38 → 87.58] Sweet.
[88.70 → 89.10] Oh.
[89.70 → 90.10] Uh.
[90.76 → 91.40] Oh, crap.
[91.56 → 92.20] What just happened?
[92.56 → 92.80] Oh.
[92.96 → 93.42] Oh, no.
[93.68 → 94.32] What is...
[94.32 → 94.60] What?
[94.70 → 95.52] Why is that there?
[95.96 → 96.36] Uh.
[96.48 → 96.78] What?
[97.24 → 98.72] No, this is for one of our sponsors.
[98.94 → 100.20] I don't understand why it's there.
[100.52 → 101.44] Is the intro in there?
[101.60 → 101.96] Oh.
[102.12 → 102.66] Oh, wow.
[102.82 → 103.56] That's not...
[103.56 → 103.68] Yeah.
[103.68 → 104.82] What did you do, Jake?
[105.24 → 105.60] Uh.
[105.82 → 106.54] I blame...
[106.54 → 106.74] I blame...
[106.74 → 107.40] Click on that again?
[107.54 → 108.20] I blame John.
[108.26 → 109.52] No, I don't want to click it again.
[110.52 → 111.80] Let's just...
[111.80 → 112.14] Yeah.
[113.00 → 113.90] When show time.
[114.08 → 114.36] Sweet.
[116.24 → 116.64] Okay.
[117.00 → 117.42] Wait, wait.
[117.72 → 118.00] Uh.
[119.02 → 120.14] Okay, this...
[120.14 → 120.50] Look.
[121.06 → 122.10] One day...
[122.10 → 123.50] One day...
[123.50 → 124.74] I'm going to hire a producer.
[125.92 → 127.28] But just for one day.
[127.48 → 128.34] And then I'm going to be like,
[128.78 → 129.62] Ah, you know what?
[129.68 → 130.40] The show was better.
[130.58 → 132.30] The show was better when it sucked.
[132.42 → 133.44] We liked the problems.
[134.42 → 135.90] I'm going to do the verbal call-outs.
[135.98 → 138.50] Thank you, Smart Deploy, Squarespace, and Savage Jerky.
[138.50 → 140.86] Yeah, for sponsoring today's hot mess.
[141.04 → 141.26] Yeah.
[141.42 → 141.82] Um.
[141.90 → 142.34] All right.
[142.74 → 145.50] So, why don't we jump right into...
[146.70 → 147.28] Um.
[147.50 → 148.32] Oh, we're going...
[148.32 → 148.58] Okay.
[148.72 → 149.20] Yeah, no.
[149.50 → 149.90] Sweet.
[150.18 → 150.72] You know what?
[151.20 → 151.48] Oh, wow.
[151.48 → 153.24] James picks what he thinks are the main topics.
[153.36 → 155.12] But I don't always agree anyway.
[155.12 → 155.96] Those are sponsors.
[156.74 → 157.40] We're not on YouTube?
[158.18 → 158.30] No.
[158.46 → 159.30] What do you mean we're not on YouTube?
[159.50 → 160.98] What did you even do, Jake?
[161.40 → 163.70] It says live right here.
[164.18 → 164.86] I don't...
[164.86 → 165.12] Oh.
[165.52 → 166.50] I don't understand.
[166.64 → 167.20] Is it unlisted?
[167.36 → 168.36] Is it unlisted?
[168.50 → 169.38] That's possible.
[169.80 → 170.12] Uh.
[170.20 → 170.66] But, uh.
[170.76 → 170.90] Uh.
[170.90 → 172.68] Yes, it is unlisted.
[172.90 → 173.20] Okay.
[173.40 → 174.86] We were unlisted.
[175.02 → 175.26] Nice.
[175.52 → 176.08] Unlisted on YouTube.
[176.52 → 176.96] Uh.
[177.60 → 178.06] Well.
[178.24 → 180.66] Did 109 people make it here unlisted?
[180.80 → 181.14] That's good.
[181.24 → 181.64] Really?
[182.92 → 183.40] Wow.
[183.54 → 184.66] How did that...
[184.66 → 186.10] That is impressive.
[186.16 → 188.02] Did you leave your tab open for a week?
[188.14 → 188.36] Here.
[188.46 → 190.98] This is something I've always kind of wondered about.
[191.24 → 191.44] Yeah.
[191.44 → 191.98] Well, good one.
[191.98 → 192.08] Thank you.
[192.08 → 199.88] So, you know how the only thing keeping an unlisted video or an unlisted Imgur post or whatever
[199.88 → 206.96] it is, an unlisted thing private, the only thing keeping it private is that sort of pseudo-random
[206.96 → 210.32] string of characters after the domain.
[210.32 → 212.44] Well, and I think crawlers don't pick it up.
[213.36 → 213.78] Um.
[214.00 → 214.36] Okay.
[214.66 → 215.04] Fine.
[215.98 → 227.36] But when you upload something unlisted, if anyone were to just, like, typo, if they were to typo in something that happened to exactly perfectly match what you uploaded,
[227.36 → 230.14] they would be able to access it immediately.
[230.44 → 230.62] Yeah.
[230.90 → 231.96] And, you know, you look at...
[231.96 → 232.52] Likeliness is very low.
[232.60 → 233.68] You look at something...
[233.68 → 234.36] Well, okay.
[234.80 → 234.92] Here.
[235.48 → 236.22] Hold on a second.
[236.38 → 236.72] Try it.
[237.12 → 238.20] Because here's what...
[238.20 → 238.70] You know what?
[239.42 → 239.78] Okay.
[240.38 → 241.02] I will.
[241.34 → 242.44] That just seems fun.
[242.54 → 243.42] I'm not even really challenged.
[243.62 → 244.02] I'm just interested.
[244.22 → 245.06] No, we're gonna...
[245.06 → 245.54] We're gonna...
[245.54 → 246.08] You know what?
[246.48 → 246.72] F it.
[246.76 → 247.36] We're going to do it live.
[247.84 → 248.12] Um.
[250.86 → 252.10] I just want to see...
[252.10 → 255.24] If you get anything, I suspect you'll get a public video.
[255.66 → 256.20] You think so?
[256.40 → 256.70] Okay.
[256.70 → 257.26] All right.
[257.26 → 261.92] I don't know, though, if the addresses for public and unlisted videos are different.
[262.10 → 263.74] Maybe unlisted videos have longer ones?
[263.80 → 267.36] I think this is going to be YouTube chat plays try to find the unlisted video.
[267.96 → 269.02] Oh, sweet.
[269.62 → 270.58] Here's what we're going to do.
[270.62 → 275.04] First, I need to double-check YouTube's stupid link shortener here.
[275.10 → 275.58] Yeah, there we go.
[275.60 → 275.90] There we go.
[276.32 → 279.44] So I'm just going to grab this, and I want to know how many characters it is.
[279.50 → 283.30] So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
[283.46 → 285.06] So it's only 11 characters.
[285.06 → 290.06] And when you think about the sheer number of videos that get uploaded to YouTube...
[290.06 → 293.30] No numbers, right?
[293.34 → 293.88] Is it no numbers?
[293.94 → 294.64] There are numbers.
[294.72 → 295.26] There are numbers.
[295.40 → 295.82] There are numbers.
[295.98 → 296.06] I still...
[296.06 → 297.72] Lowercase, capital, and numbers.
[297.92 → 299.10] I like them odds.
[299.30 → 300.02] I like them odds.
[300.14 → 300.38] All right.
[300.38 → 302.02] So here, hold on.
[302.06 → 304.08] I don't even know if my screen sharing is...
[304.08 → 304.64] Oh, boy.
[305.00 → 305.74] Oh, boy.
[305.86 → 308.02] We are having a good day today.
[309.44 → 309.80] Yes.
[310.58 → 310.98] Properties.
[311.18 → 313.24] We're going to deactivate that their thing.
[313.38 → 315.50] Someone clapped twice, and then your screen sharing went away.
[315.50 → 315.70] There we go.
[315.84 → 316.82] Beautiful, beautiful.
[317.76 → 318.36] All right.
[318.74 → 321.34] So guys, hit me up here.
[321.54 → 324.84] I need to know what we should start typing.
[324.92 → 325.44] You go first.
[325.44 → 326.40] Apparently, it also has...
[326.40 → 326.72] What?
[327.02 → 327.22] Oh.
[328.16 → 329.28] Capital S.
[330.10 → 330.42] Yes.
[331.14 → 331.52] All right.
[331.96 → 332.60] YouTube chat.
[332.68 → 333.08] Let's go.
[333.68 → 333.94] Okay.
[334.02 → 335.90] YouTube chat is really not on the ball today.
[337.42 → 338.06] Twitch chat.
[338.12 → 338.78] You guys are next.
[338.82 → 339.66] Head over to Twitch chat.
[339.76 → 339.84] Yeah.
[339.90 → 340.30] Twitch chat.
[340.30 → 341.02] You guys are up.
[341.12 → 341.24] Okay.
[341.28 → 341.80] We got F.
[341.86 → 345.10] I don't know if that was to pay respects or if that was just...
[345.10 → 346.06] Both sides said F.
[346.18 → 346.32] Okay.
[346.36 → 347.30] We're not putting in...
[347.30 → 349.22] We're not just putting in all FS, you guys.
[349.90 → 350.12] Oh.
[350.48 → 352.10] Drive me nuts here.
[353.28 → 353.98] Lowercase P.
[354.34 → 354.90] Lowercase P.
[354.98 → 355.78] I saw a 5.
[356.12 → 356.36] Sure.
[356.42 → 356.56] Okay.
[357.08 → 357.96] Someone wants a ye.
[358.52 → 359.52] So let's get that in there.
[359.56 → 359.98] What do we get?
[360.04 → 360.98] We got 6 so far.
[361.06 → 362.02] Give me a couple more.
[362.28 → 363.12] Go YouTube side.
[363.16 → 363.72] No more FS.
[363.72 → 364.52] Oh, that's Twitch still.
[364.54 → 364.64] Twitch chat.
[364.70 → 365.32] You guys are done.
[365.40 → 365.94] Too many FS.
[365.96 → 366.50] Too many FS.
[366.60 → 366.80] All right.
[366.82 → 367.38] We got a 2.
[367.46 → 368.98] We got a 2 over on YouTube from Hunter.
[369.14 → 369.56] Thank you.
[369.62 → 372.18] We've got a capital A from whatever.
[372.40 → 372.88] Twitch chat.
[372.96 → 373.44] Press F for F.
[373.44 → 373.86] An E.
[374.02 → 374.54] A 6.
[375.04 → 375.28] Okay.
[375.34 → 375.76] Hold on.
[375.94 → 376.74] I think that's it.
[376.94 → 377.70] So let's try it.
[377.90 → 378.18] Okay.
[380.18 → 381.02] Video unavailable.
[381.84 → 382.52] So is that a swing and a miss?
[382.52 → 384.80] Was that a video at one point in time?
[384.80 → 385.50] Or was it deleted?
[386.40 → 387.06] I don't know.
[387.10 → 388.24] And also, why is this broken?
[388.70 → 390.06] That's pretty weird.
[391.14 → 398.58] Reminds me of that time long ago when YouTube went down for nearly an hour.
[399.64 → 400.72] Did it?
[400.88 → 401.06] Yeah.
[401.26 → 401.58] Really?
[401.76 → 401.94] Yeah.
[401.94 → 402.54] It was sweet.
[403.36 → 406.08] We had a rise of signups, and we had a rise of viewership.
[406.78 → 407.86] It was awesome.
[407.86 → 409.86] I actually did not know that.
[409.86 → 410.62] Appreciate it, YouTube.
[411.90 → 412.94] Thank you so much.
[413.04 → 413.16] Yeah.
[413.16 → 417.82] I was actually on a call with them this week and like the first thing I said, I was like...
[417.82 → 418.54] We're missing a digit.
[419.40 → 420.24] Oh, are we?
[420.50 → 420.86] Apparently.
[421.16 → 421.96] Someone...
[421.96 → 422.32] Hold on.
[422.32 → 423.12] People are saying that.
[424.32 → 427.70] One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[427.72 → 427.98] No, no.
[428.04 → 428.46] We got 10.
[428.54 → 429.16] No, we got 10.
[429.24 → 429.70] We just failed.
[429.78 → 430.18] We just failed.
[430.32 → 430.84] It wasn't 11?
[430.90 → 432.58] We could just try like a seven at the end though.
[432.78 → 433.94] No, that's unavailable too.
[434.62 → 435.34] I mean...
[435.34 → 435.70] Okay.
[436.02 → 443.38] So anyway, my point was if someone accidentally found it, they would be able to access it.
[443.60 → 446.70] I don't exactly remember where I was going with this.
[447.06 → 449.60] So it's sort of irrelevant at this point.
[451.18 → 451.58] But...
[451.58 → 455.12] Oh no, we were talking about the stream, and then it came up of whether people would
[455.12 → 456.04] be able to find it.
[456.14 → 456.60] Oh yeah.
[456.76 → 457.82] Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[457.82 → 459.20] It just doesn't change week to week.
[459.28 → 468.76] So what I was going to say was could there be like a botnet out there that is trying random
[468.76 → 473.80] strings and then just you could, it could be as simple as screen scraping it to determine
[473.80 → 479.78] if it's an unlisted video and then like compiling this database of videos that people were never
[479.78 → 480.72] intended to see.
[483.00 → 485.94] Could a hundred of them have ended up watching the WAN show before it started?
[486.00 → 486.10] Okay.
[486.10 → 490.88] That seems less likely, but I don't actually don't even know how you navigate to a live
[490.88 → 491.14] stream.
[491.96 → 492.64] Me neither.
[492.86 → 493.66] But I think...
[493.66 → 495.06] I thought you just go to like their channel page.
[495.16 → 495.38] Anyway.
[495.46 → 495.64] Yeah.
[495.64 → 498.18] But when it's unlisted, right.
[498.32 → 500.04] But then apparently the link doesn't change.
[500.20 → 503.56] So people had tabs open, which seems to be quite common.
[504.98 → 505.38] Yes.
[505.42 → 507.14] My influence is going well.
[507.54 → 511.04] I still remember when you used to give me crap about having so many tabs open.
[511.52 → 511.82] Yeah.
[512.30 → 514.54] Now it's like, can't live without my tabs.
[514.66 → 514.98] Dude.
[515.12 → 516.06] Gotta have my tabs.
[516.10 → 516.68] Work computer.
[517.56 → 520.20] Like partway through the week, I just was maxed out.
[521.44 → 524.52] I was trying to figure out like why pages weren't really loading properly and stuff.
[524.56 → 525.22] And I was like, what the heck?
[525.46 → 528.08] Open task manager, a hundred percent of physical memory used.
[528.44 → 531.62] I was like, I only have browser tabs open.
[531.88 → 532.96] That's the only thing I'm doing.
[532.96 → 534.76] And because it's Chrome, that's like 17.
[534.76 → 535.24] Yeah.
[535.24 → 535.92] It was wild.
[535.92 → 538.14] It was wild.
[538.76 → 539.50] All right.
[539.62 → 546.22] So speaking of Google and their infinite wisdom, this first tech here, this first topic here
[546.22 → 549.72] was posted by Aluminum Tech on the forum.
[549.88 → 550.08] Yeah.
[550.08 → 552.44] And the original article here is from The Verge.
[552.48 → 554.80] Let's go ahead and pop that up.
[554.86 → 555.14] Google.
[555.94 → 562.00] To start charging Android device makers a fee for using its apps in Europe.
[562.00 → 566.02] And then Android will still be free and open source.
[566.66 → 567.26] So that's...
[567.26 → 569.18] So the operating system will be, but not the apps.
[569.32 → 569.46] That's good.
[570.00 → 572.34] So they want people to make their own apps?
[572.40 → 577.44] So basically they're changing the way that they license their suite of Android apps in
[577.44 → 582.80] Europe, leading the company to charge a licensing fee for the Play Store and other Google apps
[582.80 → 584.42] for the first time.
[584.44 → 585.14] Play Store.
[585.24 → 585.98] For the Play Store.
[586.50 → 590.08] So in the past, I actually...
[590.08 → 594.46] You know, this is something that I wish I had kind of looked into before the show,
[594.46 → 601.82] because I remember going back like six, seven years ago, you could get Android devices that
[601.82 → 603.06] didn't have the Play Store.
[603.20 → 604.94] Like it'd be like weird knock off ones.
[605.06 → 606.46] Remember that super terrible...
[606.98 → 607.28] Yeah.
[607.62 → 607.84] Yeah.
[607.92 → 609.00] That didn't have the Play Store.
[609.12 → 609.84] What's that stupid thing called?
[609.90 → 610.44] Neptune Pine.
[610.56 → 610.96] Neptune Pine.
[610.96 → 615.06] I had to like to do a bunch of crap to it to like force the Play Store on you.
[615.06 → 618.72] And then I remember back at NCI, one of the other product managers brought in this
[618.72 → 623.00] like, I don't remember, whatever the price point was, it was like unheard of at the
[623.00 → 626.08] time, like $150 tablet or something stupid like that.
[626.64 → 628.98] And it didn't have the Play Store.
[629.10 → 631.74] And I like, I picked it up and I kind of went, wow.
[632.38 → 635.94] I mean, at that time, I think it was called the what'd they call it?
[635.98 → 637.62] Market, Android Market?
[637.92 → 638.74] Something like that.
[638.74 → 638.92] Marketplace?
[639.18 → 639.20] Marketplace?
[639.20 → 639.34] Yeah.
[639.44 → 639.72] Anyway.
[639.92 → 640.26] I don't know.
[640.72 → 641.90] Anyway, it didn't have it.
[641.96 → 643.44] And I kind of had this realization.
[643.58 → 647.16] I was like, wow, without apps, this is really stupid.
[647.52 → 648.90] It doesn't really do anything.
[648.90 → 653.50] And you could install it, but I think it might've involved rooting it or something ridiculous
[653.50 → 653.96] like that.
[653.98 → 655.24] It's a pretty annoying process.
[655.38 → 655.56] Anyway.
[655.62 → 656.46] It's not very user-friendly.
[656.78 → 657.60] It's a dumb process.
[657.96 → 660.98] And so that whole thing kind of went away.
[661.20 → 666.14] And I'm sure Twitch chat or YouTube chat is like flipping out about, you know, me not
[666.14 → 667.00] knowing exactly.
[667.24 → 668.82] It was Android Market or something like that.
[668.88 → 670.60] I think you were pretty, pretty accurate on that one.
[670.64 → 672.16] Oh, I was, I was on the phone with Google.
[672.28 → 673.54] Someone, who is this?
[673.86 → 675.92] The birdie T says, you were on the phone with Google.
[676.02 → 677.20] Finish a story for once.
[677.20 → 677.96] Come on.
[678.48 → 679.44] I was on the phone with Google.
[679.52 → 682.16] The first thing I said was thank you very much for going down last week.
[682.28 → 682.98] It was hilarious.
[683.54 → 686.18] And also, yay, float plane.
[687.56 → 688.38] Float plane for life.
[688.98 → 689.38] Okay.
[689.84 → 689.98] So.
[690.16 → 691.32] So yeah, it was called Android Market.
[691.60 → 692.08] Android Market.
[692.20 → 692.40] Yes.
[693.16 → 694.44] I said Marketplace didn't.
[694.54 → 695.28] I shouldn't have hedged my bets.
[695.32 → 695.88] I think you said both.
[696.10 → 696.50] That's okay.
[697.44 → 698.04] All right.
[698.84 → 703.14] So basically the changes came in response to a July ruling by the European Commission,
[703.14 → 709.44] which fined the company $5 billion for antitrust violations in order to stop illegally tying
[709.44 → 711.66] Chrome and search to Android.
[711.80 → 712.30] Super chats.
[713.00 → 715.20] You have got to be kidding me.
[717.36 → 717.78] That.
[718.50 → 720.10] He's actually doing it.
[720.10 → 721.02] He's actually doing it.
[721.42 → 725.10] See, little does he know that he's screwing himself.
[726.04 → 726.34] Okay.
[726.34 → 729.06] I don't even, I don't even think I, I don't even think I have it.
[729.10 → 731.68] I'm going to have to open it up over here in order to show this to you guys.
[731.68 → 732.74] Because I don't think I have it set.
[733.12 → 741.84] So Steve from gamers Nexus clearly wants his credit card deactivated by his, by his,
[742.08 → 747.24] whatever credit card companies they have in America and however that works down there.
[748.06 → 750.42] Where, where even is the live stream here?
[750.48 → 752.62] I hate, I hate this so much.
[753.04 → 755.28] I hate everything that's going on right now.
[755.28 → 757.08] I just want, I just want the lives down.
[757.16 → 758.26] I'm going to have to type it in.
[758.54 → 758.94] You know what?
[758.98 → 760.46] I'm just going to have to type it in myself.
[760.58 → 762.56] Live underscore dashboard.
[763.20 → 765.08] Because it's not, it's not there.
[765.42 → 766.42] Oh, it's under live stream.
[766.42 → 767.00] It's probably live stream.
[767.00 → 767.42] You know what?
[767.42 → 772.06] I typed it in myself and I didn't even have to guess at 10 of the characters.
[772.84 → 778.90] So I don't even care right now, but here, let's go ahead and screen share here.
[778.90 → 787.70] So last week after the WAN show in my wisdom and generosity, this was all about generosity.
[787.70 → 788.18] Yeah.
[788.28 → 789.32] Especially generosity.
[789.58 → 789.74] Yeah.
[789.88 → 797.78] I went over to Steve from gamers Nexus's live stream, and I was helpfully, you know, well,
[797.84 → 800.90] really, you know, trying to make sure that he can keep the lights on over there, you know,
[801.18 → 804.24] because I just, I really respect the content that he makes.
[804.24 → 809.16] And, you know, I know that the competition with Jay took a real toll on him, you know,
[809.26 → 810.82] financially, mentally.
[811.06 → 811.82] Takes a lot of resources.
[811.94 → 812.92] You got to mine a lot of minerals.
[813.20 → 814.06] Emotionally, you know?
[814.36 → 822.48] And so I was trying to help his company by contributing via super chats to his stream.
[823.20 → 827.20] A total of, I think it was about $32 Canadian dollars.
[827.38 → 827.48] Yeah.
[827.48 → 834.66] And so he apparently is determined to give it all back.
[835.90 → 844.72] So, so far he has contributed two, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[845.34 → 847.84] He has contributed, did he send a 10?
[847.96 → 848.74] There was one that was two.
[848.80 → 849.20] There was two.
[849.60 → 852.40] So either nine, nine or 10 US dollars.
[852.40 → 857.30] And if you believed everything I just said, then I have a bridge to sell you.
[857.36 → 859.50] Because actually this was my plan all along.
[859.92 → 863.68] Because I knew that he said he was going to give it all back.
[864.30 → 867.48] But my contributions are in Canadian dollars.
[868.16 → 869.92] And his are in US dollars.
[870.46 → 876.88] I'm effectively making 30% profit if he gives back all the money he contributed.
[877.80 → 878.62] That's pretty sweet.
[878.62 → 883.82] Except the joke's kind of on both of us because I think YouTube takes like 30%, 40% super chats.
[883.90 → 885.98] So really we're just giving YouTube a bunch of money.
[886.00 → 886.22] Yeah.
[886.38 → 886.78] Heck yeah.
[887.48 → 888.04] Thank you.
[888.08 → 889.66] Thank you our YouTube overlords.
[889.72 → 890.66] And of course, thank you, Steve.
[893.60 → 895.18] We love you all.
[895.24 → 895.78] We love you all.
[895.82 → 896.48] Especially Steve.
[896.80 → 898.36] And especially our YouTube overlords.
[900.02 → 900.96] Jeez, you guys.
[902.60 → 903.26] You know what?
[903.34 → 906.02] You know why I bet he hasn't done it in like five minutes here?
[906.20 → 907.48] I bet his credit card flagged him.
[907.48 → 908.70] That's, yeah.
[908.86 → 914.32] Because I, so what happened was I was trying to send him, so I sent him a super chat earlier in the day.
[914.34 → 915.56] Or I think Nick did it or something.
[915.76 → 916.98] Just to like mess with him.
[917.04 → 918.64] I don't remember even what the context was.
[919.08 → 919.54] Oh right.
[919.60 → 921.68] It was during his overclocking stream while he was trying to beat us.
[921.70 → 923.20] Because we wanted to make him call us out.
[923.24 → 924.10] I'll give you guys the background.
[924.50 → 926.28] We wanted to make Steve call us out.
[926.32 → 928.06] Because he acknowledges all his super chats.
[928.10 → 929.50] Because he's actually a nice streamer.
[929.50 → 932.42] We miss so many of them because we suck.
[933.74 → 934.64] And anyway.
[934.64 → 934.76] Anyway.
[935.18 → 937.90] So he was like, LOL guys.
[938.18 → 938.88] You know, whatever.
[938.98 → 940.64] We made him read something really stupid, I think.
[941.72 → 943.42] So he gave it back.
[944.08 → 945.88] And I was like, no, this will not stand.
[946.86 → 948.40] I want this contribution to go through.
[948.50 → 952.02] So the idea was I wanted to make it an awful lot of work for him to refund them.
[952.02 → 956.26] So I was sending them a dollar at a time.
[956.44 → 961.04] Now the problem is that sending a series of small transactions.
[962.18 → 963.08] Really fast.
[963.26 → 972.36] And then a large one is a great way for your credit card company to think that you are a user who has stolen that credit card number.
[972.36 → 974.54] And is kind of checking to make sure it works.
[974.62 → 974.98] Yeah.
[975.36 → 976.70] Before they make a big purchase.
[977.02 → 980.38] And so what happened was I was sending all these $1 super chats.
[980.72 → 986.94] And then I got, he held up like an LTT t-shirt on stream.
[987.12 → 989.00] And I wanted to be like, yo, nice shirt.
[989.16 → 990.12] And go like all out.
[990.16 → 993.38] So I sent him like a $50 or $100 super chat or something like that.
[993.72 → 996.56] And then immediately it was like, your card was declined.
[996.70 → 998.14] I was like, oh, crap.
[998.14 → 1000.86] So it took me like 10 minutes of like sitting here on the phone.
[1000.92 → 1004.78] Like I really dedicated time to trolling Steve because heart that guy.
[1005.70 → 1006.58] Oh, wow.
[1006.64 → 1007.92] There's a that's weird.
[1008.00 → 1008.80] They're not loading here.
[1009.50 → 1011.66] The super chats aren't loading on my laptop, but they're loading up here.
[1011.72 → 1012.94] He is still sending them.
[1013.92 → 1016.88] Apparently I was informed that he intends to send 100.
[1017.50 → 1018.62] He intends to send 100.
[1018.78 → 1019.50] There's no way.
[1019.58 → 1020.62] There's no way.
[1020.84 → 1021.68] Now tech deals.
[1022.10 → 1024.36] Now tech deals is sending super chats.
[1025.32 → 1026.10] All right, Jason.
[1027.50 → 1027.90] Chill.
[1029.10 → 1031.16] Everybody just, everybody just calm down.
[1031.50 → 1033.60] I need everybody to relax for a minute here.
[1035.92 → 1036.66] All right.
[1036.72 → 1037.06] All right.
[1037.08 → 1042.70] So let's go ahead and jump back into our topic here because I take, I take user feedback to heart.
[1042.88 → 1044.60] And we should just finish the story.
[1044.60 → 1045.12] Finish the story.
[1045.14 → 1046.98] Finish the story for once.
[1047.48 → 1054.62] So the European commission fined the company 5 billion for antitrust violations, ordered it to stop illegally tying Chrome and search apps to Android.
[1055.36 → 1055.84] Okay.
[1056.18 → 1057.38] Now, hold on.
[1057.38 → 1057.72] Okay.
[1057.76 → 1059.10] I will finish the story.
[1059.24 → 1059.52] I promise.
[1059.96 → 1066.90] But how is it that Microsoft has somehow slipped under the radar with the-
[1066.90 → 1067.42] With Edge?
[1067.54 → 1069.64] And I'm not trying to like to engage in whataboutism here.
[1069.64 → 1070.22] And OneDrive?
[1070.22 → 1071.80] How is it?
[1071.80 → 1072.44] And everything else?
[1073.48 → 1073.92] Seriously.
[1074.24 → 1078.94] What they do now is so much worse than what they got fined for before.
[1078.94 → 1086.76] The way that Edge pervasively prompts you to use it without any way to disable the behaviour.
[1087.46 → 1089.64] Like, and there's probably a reg edit somewhere or whatever.
[1089.82 → 1091.18] I'm sure there's a way to disable it.
[1091.40 → 1097.62] But without any user-friendly way to disable the message should be illegal.
[1097.62 → 1097.70] Google.
[1099.34 → 1103.94] And yet we're concerned about Google.
[1103.94 → 1104.94] Google.
[1104.94 → 1105.94] Google.
[1105.94 → 1106.94] So anyway.
[1106.94 → 1111.94] Google was bundling its search engine and Chrome apps into the operating system.
[1111.94 → 1117.28] They also blocked phone makers from creating devices that ran forked versions of Android.
[1117.56 → 1124.64] And it made payments to certain large manufacturers and mobile network operators to exclusively bundle the Google Search app on handsets.
[1124.64 → 1131.44] So before, Google didn't charge for Android and its apps because of the revenue brought in through Chrome and Search.
[1131.52 → 1133.48] And for whatever reason, our notes don't contain this.
[1133.56 → 1134.76] But also the Play Store.
[1134.90 → 1135.04] Yeah.
[1135.22 → 1136.06] Google takes the cut.
[1136.12 → 1145.82] That's why Epic Games wants you downloading Fortnite directly through their site and enabling the trust third-party side installs thing.
[1145.82 → 1148.64] Because they didn't want to give, what is it, like 30% or something stupid like that?
[1148.72 → 1148.78] It's a lot.
[1148.78 → 1149.84] Like, it's a significant portion.
[1149.84 → 1155.56] And when you're like a multi-billion dollar business like Fortnite, you know, 30%.
[1155.56 → 1157.66] A lot of money.
[1157.76 → 1158.80] Heck of a lot of money.
[1158.98 → 1159.10] Yeah.
[1160.78 → 1162.56] So before they didn't charge for it.
[1162.74 → 1168.42] But since the pre-installation of Google Search and Chrome together with our other apps helped us fund the development and free distribution of Android,
[1168.54 → 1173.00] we will introduce a new paid licensing agreement for smartphones and tablets shipped into the European economic area.
[1173.00 → 1182.62] So now, in Europe, Android is free, but the Play Store and many of Google's other apps, like Gmail, Google Maps, and YouTube,
[1182.98 → 1185.78] will be bundled together under a paid licensing agreement.
[1186.84 → 1192.08] Chrome plus Google Search can be added on top of that agreement for free, but it isn't required.
[1192.34 → 1195.88] So it's not clear yet at this time how much the fees will be.
[1195.88 → 1204.32] One thing we do know is this won't be driving costs down for Europeans who already pay more than North Americans for the equivalent devices.
[1204.90 → 1212.92] Isn't that, like, should we do, like, a dedicated video on the utterly fantastic pricing of tech in Europe?
[1213.88 → 1214.72] That would be really cool.
[1214.90 → 1219.22] Because how often do you see it where, for some reason, it's...
[1219.22 → 1226.40] Remember, okay, this is a slightly behind-the-scenes thing, but remember when I wanted to make that video of, like, buying technology,
[1226.52 → 1228.50] the experience of buying technology in different countries?
[1228.54 → 1230.18] Yeah, we did one episode in, like, Switzerland.
[1231.26 → 1232.54] Did we actually do it?
[1232.74 → 1233.10] Yes.
[1233.66 → 1234.32] You filmed it.
[1234.34 → 1235.48] I didn't think we released it.
[1235.60 → 1235.88] Yeah.
[1236.22 → 1236.54] Oh.
[1236.78 → 1237.90] It wasn't very well received.
[1238.04 → 1238.18] Yeah.
[1238.18 → 1238.86] It was kind of rushed.
[1239.10 → 1240.02] But it was a concept.
[1240.08 → 1240.52] It was quite rushed.
[1240.68 → 1240.94] But, yeah.
[1241.04 → 1241.66] Could have done better.
[1241.76 → 1242.66] It kind of sucked.
[1243.14 → 1245.92] Like, there was a store that was really cool.
[1246.08 → 1246.78] I remember that.
[1246.78 → 1249.00] There was a like, I think it was called Media March.
[1249.68 → 1252.74] And it was a really cool store because they had lots of keyboards on display and all this kind of stuff.
[1252.92 → 1254.32] But everything was wicked expensive.
[1255.62 → 1256.58] Like, it was rough.
[1258.22 → 1258.74] Brutal.
[1259.00 → 1262.84] And, like, dealing with different mods on the forum, on the Linus Tech Tips forum,
[1263.04 → 1268.42] that happened to be in Europe or Australia or New Zealand or, like, other areas kind of like that.
[1268.56 → 1271.18] It's always just wicked how expensive their stuff is.
[1271.36 → 1272.74] For a long time, I thought it was VAT.
[1273.48 → 1277.80] Because I know a lot of prices have VAT bundled into the price, which is actually really cool.
[1278.20 → 1278.32] Yeah.
[1278.32 → 1278.82] And North American prices.
[1278.82 → 1281.40] It's nice to know how much stuff actually costs before you pay for it.
[1281.46 → 1284.00] It's like, oh, plus tax, plus tip.
[1284.24 → 1285.12] I'm like, okay.
[1285.56 → 1286.58] Potentially service fees.
[1286.64 → 1288.18] How much does lunch cost then?
[1288.46 → 1288.68] Yeah.
[1288.94 → 1289.36] Who knows?
[1291.06 → 1291.92] And, yeah.
[1291.98 → 1293.64] North America, it's not included in the prices.
[1293.64 → 1295.58] So, sometimes that can explain the Delta.
[1295.70 → 1297.54] But very often, it's even higher than that.
[1297.66 → 1298.10] Makes sense.
[1298.10 → 1303.76] And the crazy thing is, like, Canadians whine a lot about how much we have to pay for stuff.
[1304.16 → 1310.34] And there are things up here that are more expensive just because of our – well, not just because.
[1310.40 → 1313.98] There's Canadian products that are cheaper in America than they are in Canada.
[1313.98 → 1322.10] Partly because of our large geographical coverage and partly because of our low population density and partly because of a wide variety of other reasons.
[1322.20 → 1324.28] But there are lots of things that are more expensive in Canada.
[1324.84 → 1327.68] But tech, by and large, isn't really one of them.
[1327.68 → 1342.70] Like, back when I was working at NCI and New egg was on the verge of its launch in Canada, it was hilarious because NCI at that time had a pretty good reputation for taking care of customers for the most part.
[1342.80 → 1345.50] But in some cases, it didn't have the greatest policies.
[1345.78 → 1350.96] It adhered to its policies, but some of them weren't that customer-friendly.
[1350.96 → 1360.28] Things like restocking fees and, you know, pretty limited RMA windows for certain categories of devices, all that kind of stuff.
[1360.40 → 1366.38] Like, if I was buying something like a monitor, even when I worked at NCI with my staff discount, I'd still buy it at Best Buy.
[1366.80 → 1369.74] Because that way, if I have a dead pixel, I can just return it.
[1369.96 → 1374.94] Whereas NCI had their, like, dead pixel policy that you had to buy on top of the price of the monitor.
[1374.94 → 1388.70] Anywho, so a lot of the disgruntled customers who weren't happy with NCI were rejoicing that New egg was finally going to come to Canada and bring its amazing pricing to Canada.
[1389.06 → 1396.48] And then they launched, and it was like a giant wet fart because NCI's pricing was never that bad.
[1396.80 → 1396.90] Yeah.
[1396.90 → 1407.72] The bad pricing at that time was primarily due to fluctuations in the U.S.-Canadian exchange rate and the inequality of the U.S.-Canadian exchange rate.
[1407.92 → 1413.80] And for a while there, Canadians were used to price parity, even if there was a difference in dollar value.
[1414.64 → 1421.90] So we were used to the idea where if our dollar was worth less, it would still cost the same amount of total dollars regardless of difference.
[1421.90 → 1422.70] Yeah, here we go.
[1422.70 → 1430.00] So the last time that the CAD and the greenback traded at par was July 22, 2008.
[1430.98 → 1431.42] Womp.
[1431.46 → 1441.94] So after that, people were getting frustrated because I think it got as bad as, like, 1.4, 1.45 CAD to the U.S. dollar, something stupid like that.
[1442.50 → 1451.60] And so people were like, oh, it must be because, you know, gouging Canadian retailers or because manufacturers charging more to Canada.
[1451.60 → 1455.02] But actually, it was just the difference in our currencies.
[1455.02 → 1455.82] The dollar just sucked.
[1457.32 → 1459.78] And so, right.
[1460.22 → 1469.72] So Canadians whine about the pricing up here, but compared to how Europeans get it, I'm really glad to be in Canada because you'll see a new product launch.
[1470.18 → 1473.44] And it'll be like MSRP, $599 U.S. dollars.
[1473.44 → 1479.66] And then based on a 1.3 exchange rate, which is what we're looking at right now, that'll be about $800 Canadian.
[1480.74 → 1487.98] But then you'll see it be like, you know, 599 euros and 599 pounds.
[1488.36 → 1491.24] I'm kind of looking at it going, now, hold on a minute.
[1491.24 → 1504.78] Now, it makes sense that Canadians have a higher dollar value price to pay because our dollar is worth only about four of ours to three American dollars or something along those lines, I think.
[1505.12 → 1509.76] But for Europeans, their currency is worth more.
[1510.28 → 1512.46] So why isn't it 499?
[1512.46 → 1512.66] 599.
[1514.78 → 1516.44] As far as I can tell.
[1516.82 → 1518.46] You've got to remember the VAT thing, but still.
[1518.62 → 1519.88] There's the VAT thing, yes.
[1520.00 → 1524.82] But as far as I can tell, manufacturers are taking more margin from European customers.
[1525.02 → 1534.34] And you can make the argument that from a sort of relative cost of living and relative earning power perspective, it's not really costing them any more.
[1535.14 → 1537.76] But I don't know.
[1537.92 → 1538.58] That might be bad.
[1538.80 → 1539.50] Some kind of brutal.
[1539.60 → 1540.22] That's all there is to it?
[1540.30 → 1540.44] Yeah.
[1540.44 → 1543.88] Everyone's just repeatedly pointing out the VAT thing.
[1544.08 → 1544.24] Yeah.
[1544.36 → 1546.66] We've been saying that since the start of this conversation.
[1547.14 → 1548.52] We are aware of that.
[1548.74 → 1549.06] Thank you.
[1549.18 → 1550.22] The value added tax.
[1550.30 → 1551.56] What is the value that it adds?
[1552.42 → 1553.44] You feel good inside.
[1553.50 → 1553.82] Do you?
[1554.16 → 1555.66] When you pay it.
[1555.72 → 1556.96] I feel good inside.
[1556.96 → 1557.96] That's the added value.
[1558.10 → 1558.30] Yeah.
[1558.82 → 1564.94] I mean, whenever I get it given to me like that, it's definitely my insides that feel the best.
[1564.94 → 1574.64] And on that note, speaking of my insides feeling the best.
[1575.04 → 1575.36] Wow.
[1575.86 → 1576.74] Savage jerky.
[1576.84 → 1578.66] Oh, that's highly applicable.
[1579.16 → 1579.38] Yeah.
[1579.38 → 1582.38] Oh, there's a mojo habanero.
[1582.60 → 1582.76] Oh.
[1583.26 → 1585.40] That's a hot level, but not a maximum level.
[1585.46 → 1586.32] I actually want to try that.
[1586.48 → 1589.70] I'm going to have some maple buffalo bacon first, though, because I'm just like so excited right now.
[1590.48 → 1591.36] Savage jerky.
[1591.36 → 1597.10] They set out with the goal of making a delicious snack that's not bad for you.
[1597.66 → 1600.96] They make their jerky without nitrates or preservatives.
[1601.62 → 1607.46] And they've got 13 different flavours, like their sriracha bacon and maple buffalo bacon, which is my personal favourite.
[1607.76 → 1616.36] And they also make barbecue sauce, which I actually haven't tried, but I really want to now, because they also make hot sauce, which is flipping awesome.
[1616.54 → 1617.86] That hot sauce I took home.
[1618.36 → 1621.00] So, so far, all I had put it on was like some pasta.
[1621.40 → 1622.30] That's a normal thing.
[1622.32 → 1625.10] Is that a normal thing, putting hot sauce on like a...
[1625.10 → 1627.34] I actually don't know, but I did it too.
[1627.84 → 1628.06] So...
[1628.06 → 1629.82] Like just a red sauce meat pasta?
[1629.94 → 1630.16] Yeah.
[1630.46 → 1631.28] That's got to be.
[1631.44 → 1631.64] Okay.
[1631.80 → 1632.20] Whatever.
[1632.38 → 1632.66] It's good.
[1633.00 → 1635.20] Red sauce and meat with hot sauce makes sense.
[1635.30 → 1636.68] Hadn't had it on a burger yet.
[1637.76 → 1638.12] Oh.
[1638.48 → 1639.28] I still haven't had it on a burger.
[1639.52 → 1643.10] Sharp cheddar, cheeseburger, a little bit of hot sauce on there.
[1643.10 → 1643.96] Oh, it was so good.
[1644.06 → 1644.92] What is the one that you got?
[1645.44 → 1646.40] I don't remember.
[1646.40 → 1651.28] But I'm just going to like, I'm going to hold on to the jar and make sure that I just get the same one.
[1651.40 → 1655.76] Because I'm the kind of person that once I find something I like, I don't tend to branch out much.
[1656.76 → 1658.50] So I'm just sticking with those...
[1658.50 → 1660.46] Those chicken boxes that we no longer have access to?
[1660.46 → 1660.58] Yeah.
[1660.72 → 1666.04] But I mean, that was something where like, I was kind of forced to try it by the sponsor spot that we were doing.
[1666.10 → 1667.04] We're featuring their hot sauce.
[1667.10 → 1670.24] I didn't want to like, talk about how great it is without having tried it.
[1670.28 → 1671.24] So I was like, yeah, I need to try it.
[1671.24 → 1672.98] And I was like, wow, this is good.
[1673.26 → 1675.84] The Tabasco is done.
[1676.28 → 1679.66] Yes, I know Tabasco is like the world's most boring hot sauce.
[1679.76 → 1681.60] But it was like what I was used to.
[1681.68 → 1683.60] And I don't, I don't, look, I don't switch.
[1684.32 → 1685.00] But I switched.
[1685.26 → 1685.90] I don't regret it.
[1685.90 → 1688.46] Anyway, they have a trick or treat promo this weekend only.
[1688.70 → 1689.64] Use offer code LTT.
[1689.64 → 1691.96] You'll save 13% instead of 10%.
[1691.96 → 1700.78] And if you order three bags or more, they will throw in a trick or treat with either a maple buffalo bacon or a Carolina Reaper at no additional cost.
[1701.62 → 1702.44] What's the trick?
[1703.68 → 1705.40] I think the trick is...
[1705.40 → 1706.16] You don't get to decide.
[1706.26 → 1707.84] Go fast, or you don't get the deal.
[1709.48 → 1710.16] That's fair.
[1712.24 → 1714.22] This mind show is also brought to you by Squarespace.
[1714.80 → 1714.96] Yeah.

[1727.50 → 1728.60] Squarespace provides...
[1729.42 → 1730.00] Oh, so good.
[1730.12 → 1731.10] Okay, I'm going to finish this first.
[1736.60 → 1739.90] No matter what you want to do, whether you want to make a website about your love of jerky,
[1740.80 → 1745.66] create a, you know, sign up an informational page for the local sports team that you help coach,
[1745.66 → 1749.08] or whatever it is, Squarespace makes it easier.
[1749.36 → 1752.48] They provide award-winning 24-7 customer support via live chat and email.

[1756.04 → 1758.74] And you can now transfer your third-party domains to Squarespace.
[1758.84 → 1759.80] That's been a feature for a while.
[1760.48 → 1760.80] Whatever.
[1761.12 → 1764.00] Instead of working with multiple vendors to maintain your online presence,
[1764.00 → 1766.38] you can manage all your domain and billing settings with Squarespace.

[1773.26 → 1778.72] So head to squarespace.com forward slash LTT and use code LTT to save 10% on your first purchase.
[1779.90 → 1781.00] Bringing us finally to...
[1782.28 → 1783.00] Dun-DA-da-da-da-da!
[1783.00 → 1783.44] Dun-DA-da!
[1784.52 → 1786.80] Okay, so it's supposed to be the three videos.
[1787.10 → 1787.72] The three videos?
[1787.92 → 1788.50] See the...
[1788.50 → 1788.68] Oh!
[1789.18 → 1790.64] That's what I didn't tell you about at the beginning.
[1790.96 → 1791.28] Okay.
[1791.46 → 1792.22] So you click on one.
[1792.42 → 1794.10] We talk about it until that video ends.
[1794.18 → 1794.84] And you click on the next one.
[1794.88 → 1795.32] We keep talking.
[1795.38 → 1795.88] You click on the next one.
[1795.94 → 1796.26] We keep talking.
[1796.48 → 1796.76] Neat.
[1797.10 → 1798.38] That's what's on-screen during this book.
[1798.52 → 1800.56] So this video is brought to you by Smart Deploy.
[1801.46 → 1802.66] So I start it now?
[1802.92 → 1803.24] Click, yeah.
[1803.66 → 1804.12] How's this one?
[1804.34 → 1805.08] Ah, look at that.
[1805.12 → 1805.42] There you go.
[1805.54 → 1807.36] Wow, this is so slick and fancy.
[1807.54 → 1807.70] Yeah.
[1807.70 → 1814.14] Smart Deploy is a modern computer imaging software that offers IT control and efficiency through centralized single image management and
[1814.52 → 1818.76] Pre-built device driver packages if you work in IT you might be familiar with old-school
[1819.20 → 1823.50] Disk cloning tools because back in the day you needed a separate image for each computer model
[1823.50 → 1828.42] And when you have thousands of users it can be pretty tricky to keep a library of 10 plus images up to date
[1828.64 → 1835.58] That haha there goes another one is why Smart Deploy was created its hardware independent
[1835.58 → 1843.16] So it allows you to deploy just one image to any computer model so you can download Smart Deploy and search their library of over
[1844.38 → 1845.98] 1200 platform packs
[1845.98 → 1850.84] We checked out the business class models that we have here at Linus Media Group, and they have a ton
[1851.54 → 1855.96] they also offer one-click user data migration for simplified migrations to Windows 10 and
[1856.68 → 1863.28] Zero-touch network deployment imaging over the internet so you can set it up in an afternoon. So we're giving away 15 free licenses
[1863.28 → 1866.96] Oh, that's pretty cool with one year of support to our viewers
[1866.96 → 1872.00] So that's six hundred and fifty-five bucks worth of free IT software if you're not in IT
[1872.00 → 1875.78] Then you don't have to take it, but you could send it to your friend in IT
[1875.78 → 1876.90] That would be a good idea
[1876.90 → 1884.54] So if you work at a company with 50 to 50 thousand computers head to smart deploy comm forward slash Linus and claim your free smart deploy licenses
[1884.54 → 1890.16] That's kind of neat like they gave us this whole thing that I don't think we're going to make it all the way through
[1890.28 → 1893.92] But I think you guys mostly get the point. Oh, there's the platform packs
[1894.84 → 1895.84] neat
[1895.84 → 1896.84] Look at that
[1897.60 → 1902.96] Surface book too. Wow. Oh, yes. No Surface Book 2 is not the one that's like very, very new
[1903.14 → 1906.02] That's just the one that's like pretty new. Yeah, cool
[1907.02 → 1909.02] all right, so
[1909.66 → 1911.66] We should do some topics
[1911.66 → 1918.64] On the monster. Can you tell me the exciting thing? I'm dying here. That was it. Well, lets we had videos for an ad spot
[1919.40 → 1921.40] really
[1923.34 → 1929.56] It became insanely less exciting when the video played in the intro, and I was like, hmm
[1935.26 → 1941.22] Really yeah, I waited how long have we been broadcast 34 minutes. I waited half an hour
[1941.66 → 1943.66] For that
[1943.66 → 1945.66] Dick
[1945.66 → 1947.90] I only bring the goodness, all right?
[1949.40 → 1952.12] Um, okay, then so Samsung's
[1952.90 → 1957.16] Device mobile design roadmap is out in the wild. This was posted by
[1957.90 → 1961.56] BowBoozoo on the forum. Let's go ahead and pull this up
[1961.56 → 1968.20] And this is the fancy display tech that Samsung apparently wants for its future phones
[1968.20 → 1972.06] And it sounds amazing. So this is a written article
[1972.14 → 1977.00] So there's not really going to be a lot for me to show you guys there. I want to have fingerprints under the screen
[1977.00 → 1982.86] They want to have under screen sensors including camera. They want to have under panel sensors
[1984.48 → 1991.28] Vibrations that emanate from the screen haptics on display instead of like down and below which
[1991.28 → 1997.52] Should theoretically feel even nicer and screen sound technology sound on display
[1998.00 → 1999.00] Wow
[1999.00 → 2003.44] So let's go through these one at a time. So fingerprint reader under the screen
[2004.00 → 2009.14] That's kind of done. Yeah, so Vivo's got I think a couple of phones now that have fingerprint readers under the screen
[2009.14 → 2015.42] In fact, the rumour is that the Samsung Galaxy S10 will have a fingerprint reader under the screen. I'm going to be so thrilled because
[2015.42 → 2020.96] As much as I like iris scanning and facial recognition and all that good stuff
[2021.50 → 2026.96] I I I don't know something about me and the way I use my phone. It sits on my desk next to me a lot
[2027.20 → 2032.00] Yeah, so that's why I've never really been a huge fan of the fingerprint sensor on the back
[2032.66 → 2037.26] And the surrounding way has been whether through face ID for Apple or whether through
[2037.66 → 2038.66] but
[2038.66 → 2040.78] Yeah, what are you using it for when it's on your desk?
[2040.78 → 2044.86] I don't know just like looking at notifications or like sending a quick message or whatever
[2044.86 → 2047.02] But what notifications and what message
[2047.58 → 2049.58] Wouldn't it be faster to do on your computer?
[2049.58 → 2052.40] Twitter? So, okay, so Twitter for example
[2053.22 → 2057.12] For whatever reason like on the desktop you can't be logged into two accounts at the same time
[2057.62 → 2061.78] Unless you have or use two different browsers or use an incognito window or whatever the case may be
[2062.02 → 2065.40] So on my phone well, I have my multiple Twitter accounts
[2065.40 → 2067.68] So I can if I get a notification from when I'm not logged in
[2067.68 → 2069.28] Yeah, no, that's fair. All right, so
[2069.28 → 2071.28] There's a reason yeah
[2071.28 → 2071.52] Um
[2072.08 → 2077.60] So I like it and the workaround has always been iris scanning facial scanning of some sort
[2077.84 → 2078.32] um
[2078.32 → 2085.14] Or just picking the stupid thing up or like keying in the pin which feels like dinosaur technology to me at this point every time I have to do it
[2085.14 → 2087.14] I'm like
[2087.14 → 2089.14] Really? Um
[2089.74 → 2096.56] So I am amped to hear that we're going to be looking at a fingerprint scanner under the screen
[2096.56 → 2098.56] Hopefully on the Galaxy S10
[2098.56 → 2101.44] This other stuff is getting even tripper
[2101.44 → 2104.88] So it looks like Samsung is so anti-notch
[2105.36 → 2110.24] That they would rather ride it out until they can manage to put a camera under the screen
[2110.24 → 2114.56] So if you have a fingerprint sensor on the front, and you don't need
[2115.44 → 2116.64] to have like a fancy
[2117.20 → 2120.08] Um, you know dot projector array or anything like that
[2120.48 → 2123.92] Then there would be no need for the notch as long as you can do the camera
[2123.92 → 2127.44] So if you got the fingerprint, and you've got the camera both working through the display
[2128.00 → 2132.88] Then theoretically we could go completely full screen for the phone
[2132.88 → 2136.56] I you're you're distracting me. What is going on here?
[2136.56 → 2142.88] Oh, there are bots like a little yeah, and that's without doing things that will that are neat, but will
[2143.60 → 2144.64] obviously
[2144.64 → 2146.24] compromise the
[2146.24 → 2150.24] longevity of the device, you know after a while like I
[2151.28 → 2154.56] I haven't yet seen any real evidence that the find X and
[2155.28 → 2157.28] the nexus
[2157.28 → 2162.16] are going to fail, you know with their cameras that come in and out, but I
[2163.20 → 2166.00] mean with the amount of like I remember um
[2166.64 → 2168.40] Actually, this is a funny story. So
[2169.84 → 2171.12] I ended up with Nick's
[2171.92 → 2177.28] iPhone 6 okay for like next to nothing because he was like yeah, it doesn't charge anymore
[2177.76 → 2178.72] And I was like, oh, okay
[2179.36 → 2181.36] So I bought it from him and
[2181.36 → 2185.68] Sold him my 6s for like super cheap because honestly, I just wanted it for like
[2186.24 → 2187.12] um
[2187.44 → 2191.52] I listen to music, or I listen to TV shows when I sleep
[2192.08 → 2197.12] Um, so I wanted something anything with a headphone jack that's got good app compatibility is fine
[2197.68 → 2201.76] But it was like 50 bucks or something stupid like that. So heck yeah, I'll use an iPhone 6 for that. Okay
[2202.16 → 2207.28] So I was like yeah, sure you can trade in you can trade in the iPhone 6 for the iPhone 6s and I'll see if I can fix it
[2207.60 → 2209.92] So the fix was um
[2210.96 → 2211.76] a safety pin
[2212.64 → 2215.04] Picking out the pocket lint in the lightning connector
[2215.04 → 2219.68] And I was like hey, oh my goodness
[2219.68 → 2221.28] Well, that worked pretty well. All right, um
[2222.56 → 2223.36] Womp
[2223.36 → 2225.12] So anyway, um
[2225.12 → 2226.32] Where was I going with this right?
[2227.12 → 2229.76] Even a very well-designed mechanism
[2230.80 → 2232.16] One with no moving parts
[2232.16 → 2235.44] I respect the lightning connector. Yeah, it is a great connector
[2235.44 → 2241.84] It was so far ahead of its time back when android phones were using gimpy micro USB connectors
[2242.32 → 2245.92] Um, so if that can manage to fail because of pocket lint
[2245.92 → 2253.44] Then I think that a moving you know retracting camera doodad, uh, really doesn't really don't stand a chance like some of them will die
[2253.92 → 2257.68] So if we can get the camera and the fingerprint under the centre under the panel
[2257.92 → 2263.28] Then we really unlock the possibility of truly full screen phones that won't be unreliable
[2264.24 → 2264.56] now
[2264.56 → 2269.12] Vibrations that emanate from the screen and sound that comes from the screen
[2269.12 → 2273.20] We've actually seen that second one before so not a lot of people watched this video
[2273.20 → 2274.96] So I'm guessing a lot of you missed it
[2274.96 → 2280.24] Were you at CES the year that Sony showed off their TV that had no speakers?
[2280.88 → 2283.12] Yeah, okay, did you ever listen to it?
[2283.12 → 2287.60] No, okay, so I managed to get like a private screening
[2288.00 → 2293.04] In the back room where they weren't really showing it to press, but they were showing it to uh partners and customers
[2293.04 → 2294.80] Yeah, and
[2294.96 → 2299.12] It was incredible. It sounded great like they did the whole thing. Um
[2299.92 → 2301.92] Have you ever been to a Bose store?
[2301.92 → 2303.28] No, yes, okay
[2303.92 → 2308.72] Uh, have you ever been in like the room where I guess this would have been like a long time ago
[2309.20 → 2315.60] But I remember going to a Bose store, and they had this whole demo room set up in the back with like these fake speakers
[2316.40 → 2322.24] That were actually just like um little like wire things with a cloth over them and a handle on the top
[2322.24 → 2327.68] So that they looked like a box, but then they could pick them up, and they're just there was nothing under there
[2327.68 → 2328.32] Oh
[2328.32 → 2335.04] And they had uh, they had this special TV that had a bunch of like side firing and upward and downward firing speakers
[2335.04 → 2337.28] It wasn't a sound bar. This was when they were doing surround
[2337.76 → 2341.12] Somehow firing it out of the TV in this special room
[2341.68 → 2346.64] Anyway, I had a similar experience in the Sony booth where they were like, oh, you know
[2346.64 → 2349.28] Where do you think the sound is all coming from? Haha?
[2349.92 → 2351.12] It's just coming from the display
[2351.12 → 2356.64] I mean, of course there wasn't much of a big reveal because the reason I arranged to get into that back room was that I really wanted to hear it
[2356.64 → 2357.68] It was pretty talked about
[2357.68 → 2359.84] Yeah, I already knew I already knew where the sound was coming from, but
[2360.72 → 2362.72] It sounded perfect
[2362.72 → 2364.72] Because if you think about it
[2365.28 → 2368.24] Fundamentally what makes sound what are speakers?
[2370.32 → 2370.88] What?
[2370.88 → 2375.04] Someone in chat said it works great until you crack the screen. Why would you crack the screen? How'd you do that?
[2375.04 → 2379.28] Um, don't worry. I just yeah, don't worry about it. Keep going
[2379.52 → 2386.88] So remember this is the same panel technology that they are literally using to make curved displays like a little bit of vibration is not going to kill it
[2386.88 → 2387.36] like if you ever
[2388.32 → 2392.48] I mean, obviously you're not going to get like rock and bass out of the thing or whatever, but no
[2393.12 → 2397.52] It sounded good. It was fine. It was fine. Like when you touch it. It's just like
[2399.12 → 2400.16] It's its it's not like
[2400.16 → 2405.28] You can barely make out the image for all the shaking or whatever
[2405.84 → 2406.64] um
[2406.96 → 2408.96] And I've actually wondered for a while
[2409.68 → 2414.08] Why it is that that technology hasn't made its way to phones because it's such an
[2414.64 → 2416.24] Obvious like I'm sure there are
[2416.88 → 2421.60] Many technological challenges with taking that technology and shrinking it into something you can actually hold
[2421.60 → 2423.20] A handheld is going to be a big problem
[2423.20 → 2429.52] But it's such an obvious way to get past needing that earphone speaker and needing that
[2429.52 → 2431.60] Well, I guess you'll still need them. Yeah, I wonder if you could
[2432.48 → 2434.48] I mean, you probably could use it as a microphone as well
[2435.68 → 2440.08] Use what just the vibrations of your voice on the screen probably it wouldn't sound very good though
[2440.08 → 2443.92] So we'll probably always think you'd have a lot of problems with other noise in the room anyway
[2443.92 → 2450.96] If and when all these texts roll out we could be looking at a completely bezel-less and maximally waterproof design
[2451.84 → 2455.36] Unless of course Samsung continues providing us with headphone jacks
[2457.20 → 2458.40] When do you think it's going to happen?
[2459.28 → 2462.08] When do you think there is going to not be a single
[2462.80 → 2465.84] Flagship device on the market left with a headphone jack?
[2466.64 → 2467.68] I don't think it'll be too long
[2467.68 → 2475.52] Or there will be one company that that's just their shtick, and they just don't drop it for a long time
[2475.84 → 2478.72] Who else is left right now? I think are we already there?
[2479.20 → 2483.36] Like who other than Samsung makes a flagship class device with a headphone jack?
[2483.36 → 2486.88] Yeah, but Samsung would totally be one of those companies that would be like no
[2487.36 → 2492.08] This is just how we do it because they are they've been trying so hard for so long to differentiate
[2493.60 → 2496.64] Hmm like they've actually been trying really hard for a while
[2496.64 → 2499.92] They've been making their own apps even when people hated them viciously
[2500.48 → 2504.24] They did not drop their own apps at any point because they're like no this is our stuff
[2504.80 → 2511.20] And then apparently now they're a little bit better. I haven't used the Samsung phone in a while. I still wouldn't use them. Yeah, but they're still trying
[2511.84 → 2513.84] Clearly they're still trying
[2514.00 → 2514.88] um
[2514.88 → 2520.08] They they finally went a unique direction in terms of colours. They're they're really trying to differentiate themselves
[2520.08 → 2522.56] They might try to hold on there. I've got people saying one plus
[2522.56 → 2525.52] Um, I don't know if you've seen the rumours from the one plus 6t, but
[2526.32 → 2529.36] It doesn't look like it's going to have a headphone jack. LG maybe
[2530.32 → 2532.32] So what is this a South Korean thing then?
[2532.32 → 2533.84] Maybe I could see it
[2534.48 → 2537.52] Are why they do some interesting stuff like remember when they had radios?
[2538.32 → 2539.92] Radio antennas and stuff
[2539.92 → 2541.76] That was localized
[2541.76 → 2545.84] But they've they've always been a little bit different in terms of their personalized technology
[2545.84 → 2550.96] That's yeah, that's fascinating that because LG also gives very many f's
[2551.60 → 2556.32] About the audio quality of their phones like they go as far as to put better quality DAX and that's like a real selling point for them
[2557.36 → 2558.96] interesting
[2558.96 → 2560.96] You know what sucks for me right now?
[2561.28 → 2567.12] I was on a first-gen pixel and I skipped pixel 2 because I was like that phone looks amazing
[2567.60 → 2571.92] But I don't need it. My phone's still fine. It's only a year old at this point. No big deal
[2571.92 → 2576.96] Now we're at the next generation of phones. You better grab a pixel 2 before they're all gone, and I hate all of them
[2579.36 → 2585.12] What and like I feel like it's just a terrible time to buy a phone because it looks like the next channel be pretty nice
[2586.48 → 2591.92] Just with the like, okay, these are all the shortcomings this year. They'll probably take care of it next year kind of stuff
[2592.64 → 2594.64] And last gen was pretty good
[2595.12 → 2597.12] But this gen is just kind of
[2597.12 → 2599.12] You know, I've had people
[2599.12 → 2602.56] Um, so I released a fairly unpopular video this week. Um
[2604.08 → 2607.68] You did yeah with basically my criticisms of the iPhone 10s
[2608.48 → 2613.84] There are a couple of things I got wrong, but by and large I stand by the majority of the complaints
[2614.56 → 2616.24] um
[2616.24 → 2621.04] As petty as they might be like I acknowledge in the video that they're they're petty they are very petty complaints
[2621.04 → 2625.52] I think people sort of miss that part, but maybe the issue here is
[2625.52 → 2633.92] And anyway, so one of the comments on that video was that it seemed like I was riding the note 9 pretty hard
[2635.20 → 2640.72] And that there was no kind of rational explanation for why I liked it so much, and I was thinking about that
[2640.96 → 2643.36] Why do I like the note 9 so much because?
[2643.36 → 2645.36] Because
[2645.60 → 2647.60] They trade blows sometimes
[2648.08 → 2655.44] But by and large the iPhone 10s does have a better camera even if it's not in a way that makes a huge difference to me day to day
[2655.76 → 2658.32] And the note 9 has a clear advantage
[2658.88 → 2663.44] Like in my dimly lit house taking pictures of fast moving targets like children that don't hold still
[2663.84 → 2666.72] Like there's there are reasons that I personally prefer that's my nice
[2666.72 → 2671.36] Yeah, um, but the iPhone 10s objectively has a better camera
[2671.68 → 2674.08] So I was like why do I like the note 9 so much?
[2674.64 → 2678.64] And I think the answer was because that's exactly what they did
[2679.36 → 2681.36] they took the last gen and
[2682.48 → 2686.32] Didn't change anything other than tweak the couple of things that were bad
[2687.68 → 2689.60] And that was okay. My argument here
[2690.24 → 2691.04] um
[2691.04 → 2694.72] Is going to be a bit in support of you release a billion videos
[2694.72 → 2701.20] Every day release every day on multiple channels you don't want to regurgitate yourself a million times
[2703.44 → 2707.68] If people wanted to know about the note 9 stuff that you like they would go watch the note 9 video
[2707.92 → 2711.44] You don't have to re-encapsulate every single feeling you have in every single video
[2711.52 → 2714.32] There has to be a little bit of that. I will defend the audience there
[2714.32 → 2715.44] Yeah, I think
[2716.16 → 2721.36] And there maybe could have been a little bit more in that video, but I don't think you needed an entire note 9 review in the
[2722.00 → 2722.96] uh, 10s
[2722.96 → 2725.44] I think what people were more off but by was the tone of the video
[2725.76 → 2730.64] It came across really whiny and when I was music was little when I was doing it music, but it was like
[2731.52 → 2738.32] When I was doing it I even felt whiny like I wasn't happy making it and I think that made it, so people weren't happy watching it
[2738.88 → 2739.12] um
[2739.92 → 2740.88] and
[2740.88 → 2743.20] You know, there were things that I think
[2743.76 → 2746.96] Are longer discussions than just the offhand mentions that I made of them
[2746.96 → 2754.00] So things like the Twitter app and there being only a handful of pixels that you can reach because the notch gets in the way of switching
[2754.56 → 2755.68] uh between profiles
[2756.24 → 2758.32] um, you know a lot of people are like well, that's twitter's problem
[2759.28 → 2761.92] And my response to that is I don't care
[2762.48 → 2764.40] I'm the user. Yeah, um
[2764.40 → 2768.16] Clearly this notch design language has issues
[2769.04 → 2771.12] I mean, it's got issues on the pixel 3 excel as well
[2771.12 → 2774.16] Like look at this in Google's own stupid apps
[2774.80 → 2780.16] um, here's the here's the stupid studio app and the shade
[2780.40 → 2782.16] I mean you guys aren't really going to be able to see this but like
[2783.04 → 2787.20] The stupid shade at the top cuts off one of the words and affects the readability, and it's like
[2787.20 → 2791.44] I don't want to be one of those people who just whines all day about the design
[2792.32 → 2796.00] But that's bad design, and it's your own stupid app
[2796.00 → 2798.56] How do you expect third parties to be able to keep up with this nonsense?
[2799.12 → 2800.08] so
[2800.08 → 2801.20] so I um
[2802.00 → 2803.04] So anyway
[2803.68 → 2806.24] There's a follow-up video coming. I don't know if you know this. I didn't
[2806.72 → 2808.72] So there's a follow-up video that's going to be called
[2809.36 → 2813.04] Something along the lines of 10 great reasons you should buy an iPhone
[2813.04 → 2819.36] And the idea behind it is that my personal feelings are out there. I've said what I think
[2819.84 → 2820.72] um, but
[2821.84 → 2826.72] I don't want our videos to be affected by my personal feelings so much
[2826.72 → 2832.16] And I think that what we effectively did in that video was we kind of took a crap on the people who own iPhones and love them
[2832.48 → 2836.48] Without giving equal airtime to the reasons that iPhones are great
[2837.76 → 2840.72] And to add some context here again
[2840.72 → 2844.48] In defence of you, but not in defence of your video
[2845.44 → 2852.64] Um, no worries are that we've always had a view where there's there's a device devices are for different people essentially
[2852.88 → 2855.36] I've thought for a while that my mom should probably have an iPhone
[2856.16 → 2861.28] Um, right, and she got one, and she got one, and she loves it, and it was incredible
[2861.60 → 2863.60] How fast you learn how to use it?
[2863.76 → 2865.76] It was nuts like remembering
[2865.76 → 2872.32] The pickup time for her to pick up an android phone and learn how to use like it took I think it took prop
[2872.40 → 2874.00] Sorry, mom I'm throwing you under the bus
[2874.24 → 2877.92] I think it took probably over a year dang to get her to know the difference
[2878.56 → 2884.00] Like she would send text messages as emails, and we never figured out how she did it
[2884.88 → 2886.80] And she would just like there was just these
[2886.80 → 2892.08] Uh, and there were problems like that across the entire thing, and they never went away blah blah blah blah blah
[2892.08 → 2893.84] She picks up her iPhone, and she's
[2894.96 → 2900.80] Roaring immediately upon picking it up the one problem we had was she got like a pop-up ad thing in a browser
[2901.20 → 2905.92] And I couldn't figure out how to get rid of it for it took me ridiculous amount of time, and I was super mad
[2906.08 → 2908.16] We eventually figured out you have to long press
[2908.16 → 2916.24] But like not quite as long as the other long press okay, which in my opinion is terrible, but whatever that's totally different
[2916.56 → 2920.32] Uh, but other than that absolutely loves the phone. It is the perfect phone for her
[2921.12 → 2925.76] Here's another problem with that video combat wombat says it's called a review Linus
[2925.76 → 2930.24] It's not your job to fillet apple or apple users. Don't think that was a review. It wasn't a review
[2930.24 → 2936.72] Yeah, in fact, that's what I think a lot of the apple lovers were really upset about was they missed that
[2936.72 → 2940.64] It isn't a review the video is called um
[2941.44 → 2942.56] I'm trying to
[2942.56 → 2945.36] Even apple doesn't care about the iPhone 10s. Yeah
[2945.36 → 2952.08] Because that's really what inspired that video was that watching apple's keynote. They just didn't seem to give a rat's pa toot about it
[2952.32 → 2955.84] So if you were reading like a magazine or reading an old
[2956.56 → 2957.76] old
[2957.76 → 2959.68] An old school like written
[2959.68 → 2964.88] Review web page. This would be an opinion piece. Yes, and that's exactly what it was where that would fit
[2966.48 → 2969.20] I kept seeing super chats coming in
[2970.16 → 2977.68] Um, but I kept thinking that they weren't showing up or something because I didn't realize that they show up at the bottom not the top
[2978.32 → 2983.28] So that's vibe online never going to give up the OG pixel going to ride it till it dies
[2983.28 → 2986.96] I mean mine has an honestly I probably would be
[2987.68 → 2988.80] Just see about replacing
[2988.80 → 2994.00] Yeah, you have to just borrow, and I fix it kit from work and change that screen out. I did an iPhone 7 plus the other night
[2994.00 → 2998.32] It's like I'm still pretty happy with this phone repair is not it's not that hard
[2998.48 → 3003.20] No, like people make it out like some kind of black magic, but like if I could figure out
[3003.20 → 3005.84] Yeah, I wonder how hard replacing the battery is
[3005.84 → 3012.08] Because the battery could last a little longer probably easy if the battery could last a little longer and I could swap out the cracked screen
[3012.08 → 3016.56] I'm, I'm stoked. This is something that I think is a huge I'm going to get back to super chats in a minute here
[3016.56 → 3017.76] but this is something like
[3018.24 → 3023.04] Great idea for an enterprising individual or company out there free of charge
[3024.08 → 3028.00] Have you ever tried to find an upgraded battery for a phone?
[3028.56 → 3035.44] Like as battery technology but a long time ago. Yeah, like a phone that is three years old now, and battery tech has clearly
[3036.32 → 3037.52] Come a way
[3037.52 → 3041.60] And it's right around the time that those people are going to start needing to upgrade their batteries
[3042.40 → 3044.40] I would love to have a trustworthy
[3045.28 → 3046.72] High quality
[3046.72 → 3054.56] Replacement battery that even gives me like five percent more capacity than the original one because there's something a lot of people don't know about the batteries in their devices
[3054.56 → 3061.84] Usually there's like a plus or minus as much as five or ten percent of the actual capacity that you get versus the advertised capacity
[3062.32 → 3066.72] And so if someone was willing to even just bin them
[3067.92 → 3068.88] Bin batteries
[3069.68 → 3076.96] So that you can buy a known a premium one perfect one. Yeah, yeah, like a premium battery upgrade option. I don't if it exists great, but
[3078.24 → 3082.40] I'm not sure the things I do on my phone don't require wicked performance and
[3082.40 → 3089.12] uh, the camera on the original pixels actually quite good. It's not it's not flawless the new cameras are definitely a lot better than it, but
[3089.76 → 3094.64] Um, I also have a DSLR. So if I like really need a nice photo. I can just do that
[3098.08 → 3100.08] All right
[3101.04 → 3106.24] Gamers nexus and pc world are apparently crossing streams to join the lulls. Thank you guys
[3106.24 → 3117.36] Jr dickies and says so you guys are like the Canadian mafia laundering money through YouTube to gain some sort of monetary advantage I'm on to you
[3118.00 → 3120.00] Okay, no, no, we're all losing
[3120.64 → 3122.64] Yeah, YouTube's taking it. Yeah
[3124.72 → 3125.76] Um
[3125.76 → 3131.52] The EU has a chemical fee applied to electronics. This is from brawl probably about the difference in pricing that may be true
[3131.52 → 3134.80] But so does Canada. Yep. So there's that it might be higher
[3135.68 → 3136.40] um
[3136.40 → 3138.40] What is MKD?
[3138.64 → 3144.80] A person asks when is your next sleeper pc actually we've got a couple of sleeper projects on the go right now
[3145.52 → 3151.36] One of them is pending some pretty close collaboration with an as yet unnamed, but it'll come
[3152.24 → 3158.08] As yet unnamed device manufacturer where we're trying to get one of their displays
[3158.72 → 3162.64] separate from the actual device, and then we're trying to adapt
[3163.28 → 3168.96] Regular display port to their slightly proprietary embedded display port so that we can do a sleeper
[3169.60 → 3171.60] iMac g3
[3171.84 → 3176.16] That actually has a square display yeah because almost nothing with a modern screen
[3176.80 → 3182.32] Has that aspect ratio anymore, and it's not quite right, but it's closer than you would probably think so cool
[3182.64 → 3186.32] That that's something we're working on. Another sleeper that we're working on is
[3186.32 → 3187.60] um
[3187.60 → 3189.92] a sleeper rear projection TV
[3191.68 → 3195.84] So rear projection the cool thing about rear projection TVs was they had a lot of space in them, right?
[3195.84 → 3198.24] Yeah, so if you were to take a modern
[3198.80 → 3199.68] OLED
[3199.68 → 3201.84] Or like quantum dot LCD
[3202.40 → 3206.48] And you were to put it in the front figure out a way to mount it get the sizing like mostly right
[3206.96 → 3211.60] You could actually build a receiver. Yeah, game console. Yeah, gaming pc
[3211.60 → 3216.00] Like you could build a bunch of cool crap into the back and the whole thing would be multi device
[3216.00 → 3218.00] It would look worthless to a thief
[3219.04 → 3223.92] But it would be like the bang ingest all-in-one home theatre. It would be so awesome
[3223.92 → 3229.84] Yeah, and it would probably even have like decent speakers because they did you could probably even take like the area where they had their speakers
[3229.84 → 3231.92] You could put like a really nice modern soundbar in there
[3232.96 → 3234.96] That's cool. I really like that one
[3235.04 → 3240.00] That's really awesome. I'm actually at a soundbar manufacturer reach out to us about a sponsored video recently. That is a great pitch
[3240.00 → 3242.48] Swapping out a soundbar
[3243.76 → 3250.96] Like the sleeper TV though. Yeah, yeah, yeah using their soundbar to make it not only look but sound great. That'd be awesome. Interesting. All right
[3254.56 → 3256.72] Bash net says so much better than gamers nexus
[3257.68 → 3262.96] I'm not saying that because I agree. I'm just saying it because it was like a super chat. Yeah, you have to you're all I have to I'm obligated
[3263.20 → 3267.44] Oscar says hey lions one. Thank you. Help me make my first gaming pc. I love it when people tell me that
[3267.44 → 3269.44] It's actually like awesome
[3270.40 → 3275.60] Because the funny thing is we don't really do build guides anymore. No like last time we did a build guide was like over a year ago
[3276.72 → 3278.72] Yeah, something like that. Um
[3279.36 → 3281.04] We used to do them like once a quarter
[3281.76 → 3282.88] um
[3282.88 → 3287.12] And the reason in case you guys are wondering the reason we kind of stopped doing them was like what's left to say
[3287.68 → 3295.44] We have already done like the goal that I set out with when we started doing build guides was to make the definitive how to build a pc video
[3295.44 → 3296.56] um
[3296.56 → 3304.32] I feel like we accomplished that several times over with a variety of different themes like you really can build your own pc using one of our build guides
[3305.36 → 3305.84] and
[3305.84 → 3308.72] All that really changes from year to year is the model numbers
[3309.44 → 3311.68] And even then not, not much in some cases
[3312.24 → 3313.52] um
[3313.52 → 3316.48] So that's why we kind of stopped doing them, but that doesn't change that
[3317.12 → 3321.20] Those are the ones that people really like it's the first thing out of their mouth when they approach me at like
[3321.76 → 3325.60] Ltd or CES or something like that, and it's its awesome because that really is
[3326.16 → 3331.28] You know, I think our job is to inspire people my I love those two my favourite one
[3331.92 → 3335.20] Is that we like inspired them their career?
[3336.80 → 3337.44] You know what I mean?
[3337.44 → 3341.76] Like I got into computers, or I got into programming, or I got into whatever because of your show, and I'm like that's pretty cool
[3341.76 → 3343.76] Stephen gamers nexus um
[3343.76 → 3350.16] My viewers say you think my card got blocked is this a ploy to get more money out of me to prove that you're wrong?
[3350.96 → 3356.64] Yes, and I got that five dollars man. I got it. It's in my wallet right here
[3357.92 → 3359.04] five
[3359.04 → 3360.48] dollars
[3360.48 → 3361.44] boom
[3361.44 → 3363.44] It's a new technology
[3363.44 → 3365.44] Teleports right into your
[3365.44 → 3367.44] Yeah, google wallet. Wow
[3367.44 → 3371.36] It unfortunately converted to Canadian
[3371.36 → 3372.40] Yeah, bummer about that
[3372.40 → 3373.36] That sucks
[3375.12 → 3376.16] And you know what else sucks?
[3376.72 → 3378.40] This show is over. That the show's over. Yeah.
[3378.40 → 3381.52] Thanks for watching guys. We'll see you again next week. Same bat time same bat channel
[3382.08 → 3387.60] Instead of our intro here's um a message from our sponsor smart deploy press f in chat for the show
[3387.60 → 3389.60] Oh
[3390.72 → 3397.20] Oh wow wait. No, we actually got an uh a new emoji for members
[3398.08 → 3403.36] So we have memberships available on YouTube now, and I don't know is it colon when you do the emoji?
[3404.16 → 3408.16] Uh, I think it's how do you type an emoji in it? Yeah, well
[3409.04 → 3413.68] LTT twitch viewers have the same emojis they've had before
[3414.56 → 3417.76] Is it whatever dude that's cool. You never called that out
[3418.56 → 3424.72] Hold on. No. No. This one's great though. Way to favouritism. It's just like android in your iPhone video
[3427.36 → 3429.36] Wow
[3430.56 → 3435.28] Uh, hold on a second. Where is it? Oh, okay. Hold on hold on hold on here. We go
[3435.28 → 3442.08] LTT dragon with a capital D. Oh, is it capital D that might matter? Dang it. Oh, here it is here it is. Yeah
[3443.68 → 3445.68] Woo
[3445.68 → 3447.68] That not send didn't work. Go. Yeah
[3449.04 → 3454.80] Did you see the dragon? No, you haven't seen the dragon? I saw it come in, and I saw it on the palette
[3454.80 → 3459.20] I haven't seen it out yet. It's open. Okay. Go look. All right. No look. I got it
[3464.00 → 3467.76] It's the best is the greatest oh my god
[3467.76 → 3469.76] I know right
[3469.76 → 3471.76] I know right
[3471.76 → 3473.76] I know right
[3473.76 → 3475.76] This is so cool. I know right
[3475.76 → 3477.76] The best thing ever
[3478.64 → 3480.64] I got like a little plus version of that
[3480.64 → 3482.64] I got like a little plus version of that
[3483.60 → 3484.64] But I don't have that
[3491.84 → 3495.04] What the heck did someone just send 200
[3495.04 → 3497.04] What is this?
[3497.04 → 3499.04] Is that 200 Australian dollars?
[3499.04 → 3501.04] Australian?
[3501.04 → 3506.16] Because paying three dollars a month on float plane doesn't seem like enough for Canada's hottest export
[3506.56 → 3508.56] Luke Cafetière
[3508.56 → 3513.76] Says add a donation button to float plane already so YouTube doesn't get all my cash
[3517.12 → 3521.04] Look we're working on it. Actually that that is a that is a plan that will eventually
[3521.04 → 3524.00] Eventually yeah, all right. Thanks for watching guys. See you next week
