[0.00 → 4.24] Is it gonna work?
[4.24 → 6.00] I don't know. Is it working?
[6.00 → 6.80] I don't know.
[6.80 → 9.60] How am I supposed to know?
[9.60 → 13.40] This is literally, quite literally your department.
[13.40 → 17.20] Hey, that's kind of true, but it wasn't supposed to be.
[17.20 → 18.20] Supposed to be Jake's department.
[18.20 → 19.10] We're live on Twitch.
[19.10 → 20.00] We're live on Twitch.
[20.00 → 20.90] Are we live on YouTube?
[20.90 → 22.40] Oh wow, oh my god.
[22.40 → 23.50] We're live on YouTube.
[23.50 → 24.70] Are we live on Float plane?
[24.70 → 25.70] Oh.
[25.70 → 26.20] Oh.
[26.20 → 29.00] Hold on.
[29.00 → 30.00] Hold on.
[30.00 → 31.00] Hold on.
[31.00 → 32.00] What's that?
[32.00 → 33.00] Hey!
[33.00 → 34.00] Woo!
[34.00 → 35.00] Okay.
[35.00 → 38.00] It's not playing, but that's, you know what?
[38.00 → 39.00] Yeah.
[39.00 → 40.00] Oh, that's reassuring.
[40.00 → 41.00] Wow!
[41.00 → 43.00] We are live on three platforms at once.
[43.00 → 46.00] How many terms of service are we breaking right now?
[46.00 → 47.00] One.
[47.00 → 48.00] What are Flatlanders playing?
[48.00 → 50.00] Well, you know what?
[50.00 → 54.00] I know we're already half an hour late, but darn it.
[54.00 → 56.00] We're going to cut this, and we're going to do better.
[56.00 → 57.00] We're going to cut it?
[57.00 → 58.00] Yeah.
[58.00 → 59.00] Yeah, we're going to come back.
[59.00 → 61.00] We're going to break more terms of service.
[61.00 → 62.00] Oh.
[62.00 → 63.00] Let's get a Mixer account.
[63.00 → 67.00] Actually, that wouldn't.
[67.00 → 69.00] Mixer lets you stream on other platforms.
[69.00 → 70.00] Do they let you stream on other platforms?
[70.00 → 71.00] Alright.
[71.00 → 72.00] It'd still be only one.
[72.00 → 75.00] Guys, welcome to the WAN show for the first time!
[75.00 → 81.00] Simulcasting to Float plane, YouTube, and Twitch TV.
[81.00 → 83.00] We have never done this before.
[83.00 → 84.00] Pretty unreal.
[84.00 → 88.00] Float plane just got live-streaming support.
[88.00 → 89.00] Sort of.
[89.00 → 94.00] So it's actually had live-streaming capabilities for a long time.
[94.00 → 97.00] But now, it has a chat.
[97.00 → 98.00] Hey!
[98.00 → 99.00] Look at that.
[99.00 → 102.00] Look at conception is this, okay?
[102.00 → 104.00] So they got me in the corner.
[104.00 → 105.00] Like, people watching on YouTube.
[105.00 → 108.00] They've got YouTuber Linus in the corner over here.
[108.00 → 112.00] And then there's like, whatever, there's the corner of me in the corner of the float plane.
[112.00 → 114.00] They're like, they're like watching through.
[114.00 → 115.00] You can see the delay.
[115.00 → 116.00] Look at that, baby!
[116.00 → 117.00] Heck yeah.
[117.00 → 121.00] Anyway, so it's got, I think, what, about like seven-second delay?
[121.00 → 127.00] It's, for most people, I expect it will be around ten seconds plus or minus two, but there will be outliers.
[127.00 → 128.00] I don't know.
[128.00 → 129.00] It doesn't matter.
[129.00 → 130.00] It doesn't matter.
[130.00 → 131.00] Anyway, anyway.
[131.00 → 135.00] So, do you want to tell us how much fun this was to get going?
[135.00 → 138.00] It actually wasn't even that bad, really.
[138.00 → 139.00] Oh, man.
[139.00 → 141.00] We've had the live-streaming part working for a while.
[141.00 → 143.00] If it wasn't that bad, why did it take so long?
[143.00 → 144.00] It takes so long.
[144.00 → 146.00] I mean, the chat and the...
[146.00 → 148.00] That was not float plane's problem.
[148.00 → 149.00] That was not float plane's problem.
[149.00 → 151.00] You're just going to pin it right on Jake, aren't you?
[151.00 → 153.00] No, it's so...
[153.00 → 158.00] RTMP servers, as far as we can tell, don't like...
[158.00 → 159.00] What is it?
[159.00 → 160.00] Hold on.
[160.00 → 161.00] Wait.
[161.00 → 162.00] Stop.
[162.00 → 163.00] Hold that thought.
[163.00 → 164.00] Look at this.
[164.00 → 165.00] The video quality is great.
[165.00 → 166.00] Heck yeah.
[166.00 → 170.00] I was just going to share that with the YouTube people who are enjoying YouTube live-streaming quality.
[170.00 → 171.00] I...
[171.00 → 172.00] Enjoy that, YouTube people.
[172.00 → 174.00] Just JK, we love you, YouTube people.
[174.00 → 176.00] MADE's over on YouTube right now.
[176.00 → 178.00] Wait, MADE, what are you doing watching on YouTube, bro?
[178.00 → 179.00] Wow.
[179.00 → 180.00] Wow.
[180.00 → 181.00] Wow.
[181.00 → 182.00] Wow.
[182.00 → 183.00] Way to not support Luke.
[183.00 → 184.00] Yeah.
[184.00 → 185.00] So, the guy that fixed it, AJ, thank you.
[185.00 → 190.00] He was actively playing beer pong because it's like definitely after work.
[190.00 → 192.00] Wait, it's like 830.
[192.00 → 193.00] Yeah.
[193.00 → 199.00] So, I sent him just UHH in all capital letters, and he was like, okay, I'll try this.
[199.00 → 201.00] It's a good thing I'm great at this game.
[201.00 → 203.00] Otherwise, I'd be super wasted right now.
[203.00 → 204.00] Yeah.
[204.00 → 205.00] Yeah.
[205.00 → 206.00] Should be good job.
[206.00 → 207.00] Good job, buddy.
[208.00 → 209.00] Thanks, man.
[209.00 → 210.00] You got it working.
[210.00 → 211.00] Heck yeah.
[211.00 → 212.00] Oh, terrible.
[212.00 → 213.00] Alright, alright.
[213.00 → 215.00] So, we got a great show for you guys today.
[215.00 → 218.00] I think, I don't know, I haven't actually looked at the notes.
[218.00 → 219.00] Windows 10.
[219.00 → 223.00] If you check for updates, it's been downloading preview patches.
[223.00 → 224.00] Oops.
[224.00 → 225.00] Heck yeah.
[225.00 → 226.00] What else we got here?
[226.00 → 228.00] Leaks and the launch of the Galaxy S10.
[228.00 → 230.00] Not to be confused with the Galaxy S9.
[230.00 → 232.00] My friends, this will be totally different.
[232.00 → 235.00] And two incredible things happen in China.
[235.00 → 239.00] iPhone sales were completely halted, and they banned Fortnite and PUBG.
[239.00 → 240.00] What?
[240.00 → 243.00] That's just awesome.
[243.00 → 247.00] China, you know, why you have to be no fun?
[247.00 → 250.00] How are we supposed to play PUBG on our iPhones now?
[250.00 → 251.00] Let's roll the intro.
[251.00 → 253.00] Let's roll the intro.
[258.00 → 260.00] Oh, no.
[260.00 → 262.00] Wow, I got so many times.
[262.00 → 263.00] Oh.
[263.00 → 265.00] Why did your history have a capital if mine doesn't have a place?
[265.00 → 266.00] It, wasn't it?
[266.00 → 267.00] You just give me a zero.
[267.00 → 268.00] You said it.
[268.00 → 269.00] That's what you were talking about.
[269.00 → 270.00] I never enter my iPhone.
[270.00 → 272.00] I never enter my iPhone and this one.
[272.00 → 273.00] I never enter my iPhone.
[273.00 → 274.00] I never enter my iPhone.
[274.00 → 275.00] I never enter my iPhone.
[275.00 → 276.00] I don't know.
[276.00 → 277.00] I don't know.
[277.00 → 278.00] I don't know.
[278.00 → 279.00] I don't know.
[279.00 → 282.86] I never enter my name anywhere without a capital.
[284.18 → 286.94] Okay, maybe I made that account.
[287.48 → 289.36] Then who's manning the float plane LTT account?
[289.36 → 290.44] Oh, that must be Nick.
[290.78 → 291.34] Probably.
[291.56 → 292.54] Yeah, that's got to be Nick.
[292.60 → 293.78] That's not a mystery, Nick.
[295.00 → 301.08] Alright, so why don't we jump right into our first topic today.
[302.06 → 303.56] Windows 10.
[303.56 → 306.84] You know, this has always driven me nuts.
[307.12 → 308.94] Have you ever been driven nuts?
[309.10 → 312.02] By clicking check for updates on Windows.
[312.20 → 315.88] And it being like, your computer's up-to-date.
[316.40 → 323.00] And then quite literally, three minutes later, you'll get like a thing.
[323.26 → 323.86] Downloading updates.
[324.40 → 327.10] And it's like a service pack.
[327.62 → 329.02] And you're kind of sitting there going.
[329.04 → 330.28] How did you not see that?
[330.28 → 333.34] What exactly is the purpose?
[333.50 → 335.06] I wish I could swear right now.
[335.14 → 336.32] We don't really swear on this show.
[336.32 → 343.10] But what is the purpose of this button if it doesn't check for updates?
[344.10 → 345.84] Well, now they made it work too good.
[346.16 → 351.72] So according to Microsoft, Windows 10 has B, C, and D updates.
[351.72 → 353.70] And each is released once per month.
[353.84 → 361.36] These quality updates are smaller than feature updates like the October 2018 update that came with all kinds of great features.
[361.44 → 362.20] Oh, it was wonderful.
[362.20 → 365.92] Which are meant to be released once every six months, usually in the spring and fall.
[366.16 → 368.16] We're kind of into winter now, though.
[368.28 → 369.08] Anyway, it doesn't matter.
[369.20 → 373.92] So B is the biggest and comes out on Patch Tuesday, the second Tuesday of the month.
[373.92 → 384.48] These are the most important updates featuring new security fixes, and they contain previously released security fixes from prior B updates and previously released bug fixes from prior C and D updates.
[385.12 → 388.46] Windows Update doesn't automatically install C and D updates on most PCs.
[388.60 → 391.82] However, it does when you check for updates.
[393.02 → 393.44] Maybe.
[394.04 → 398.06] According to a recent Microsoft blog post, this makes you a seeker.
[398.06 → 400.32] I'm a Quidditch player, sucker.
[400.32 → 402.58] Just because you're like, hey, I should have my computer.
[404.04 → 406.22] You weren't going to try to ignore it.
[406.60 → 407.26] You failed.
[407.70 → 408.50] That was pretty good.
[408.86 → 409.76] You failed.
[409.88 → 419.10] Okay, in the most recent, which I think is still only on Flow plane, the most recent PC Manufacturer's Investigation video, that joke line, and then they put in the credits for the joke.
[419.54 → 420.52] What was the joke line?
[420.58 → 421.72] I don't even remember this.
[421.80 → 424.56] I don't remember what you said, but you said something super funny.
[424.72 → 425.14] Oh, okay.
[425.26 → 426.36] Super aggressively funny.
[426.36 → 429.88] And they paused the whole video and ran credits as if it was over.
[430.28 → 433.08] And it was like, joke writer, Linus.
[433.96 → 435.34] Joke delivery, Linus.
[435.42 → 435.96] All this kind of stuff.
[436.04 → 438.32] And then joke support, Ivan, or something.
[438.44 → 439.16] It was wonderful.
[439.28 → 439.84] I really enjoyed that.
[439.88 → 443.56] I can say beyond a shadow of a doubt, that must have been edited by Pella.
[445.54 → 449.82] That is A plus, 1,000% his sense of humour.
[450.42 → 451.36] Also, I love it.
[451.44 → 452.50] I enjoyed it a lot.
[452.80 → 454.60] Anyway, back on topic.
[455.10 → 455.80] The seeker thing.
[455.80 → 467.18] So literally just wanting your computer to be up-to-date and secured and more stable, which is generally what you would hope that means, you get labelled as a seeker, which is basically a beta testing program.
[467.40 → 467.78] Like, what?
[467.94 → 468.28] No.
[469.72 → 470.02] No.
[470.02 → 470.94] So wait.
[470.94 → 470.96] So wait.
[470.96 → 476.76] A beta testing program for B updates taking place on stable PCs.
[476.98 → 484.32] They have repeatedly said only advanced users should click the check for updates button?
[484.32 → 491.38] Except what everyone has trained everyone to do forever is like when you're doing maintenance, you just click the check for updates button.
[491.38 → 491.56] You check for updates.
[491.76 → 492.20] So what?
[492.24 → 500.34] If I click this on like one of the servers because I'm performing server maintenance on the weekend and I want updates because it's time to reboot them?
[500.48 → 500.74] Nope.
[501.20 → 501.56] No.
[501.78 → 503.34] Now I'm an advanced user.
[503.56 → 503.88] Yes.
[504.52 → 505.24] Well, you are.
[505.24 → 508.54] But like, you shouldn't be automatically updated.
[508.54 → 509.56] Oh, this is fun.
[509.56 → 517.70] So this could explain why Microsoft generated so much hate within the tech community specifically.
[518.06 → 523.98] Like, it seemed like there was a disproportional response to the whole deleting files thing.
[523.98 → 533.48] Because normally that kind of thing can happen, but it'll be among users who will like to complain to their sister over dinner that like, I'm a stupid laptop.
[533.60 → 534.24] My files are gone.
[534.30 → 538.02] But it was like enthusiasts shrieking about it.
[538.26 → 546.48] So apparently the people who had their files deleted by the faulty October update were users who clicked the check for updates button.
[546.80 → 547.40] That's insane.
[548.30 → 549.18] It's actually insane.
[549.36 → 549.68] Wow.
[549.68 → 557.82] So that could have easily happened to me because I was like, oh, yeah, you know, I haven't really installed any updates, blah, blah, blah lately.
[557.82 → 561.46] But I do click that button when I'm ready to install an update.
[561.82 → 562.68] You know what's interesting?
[563.14 → 563.50] Fascinating.
[563.86 → 567.44] I noticed, I haven't talked about this on WAN Show, I guess.
[567.58 → 567.84] Have I?
[567.88 → 568.44] I don't think so.
[568.62 → 569.92] But I'm running Mint right now.
[569.96 → 570.22] Yes.
[570.40 → 571.26] You have talked about it.
[571.30 → 572.10] Not on WAN Show.
[572.30 → 572.76] Okay, yeah.
[572.76 → 573.48] So I did know this.
[573.54 → 574.80] So I'm running Mint right now.
[575.00 → 575.70] I was running.
[575.92 → 576.96] That's Linux, by the way.
[577.18 → 577.38] Yeah.
[577.38 → 578.28] For the uninitiated.
[578.44 → 578.60] Yeah.
[578.60 → 580.56] I was running 8.1 embedded systems.
[580.74 → 581.04] I loved it.
[581.04 → 581.50] I heard it's Mint.
[584.44 → 585.44] I loved it.
[586.24 → 589.30] But embedded systems, it's not automatically downloading updates.
[589.52 → 591.40] I had it flagged and not automatically download updates.
[591.80 → 596.84] What made it, so I had to switch to Mint was I ran Windows updates and then my computer restarted.
[597.52 → 599.06] Black screen, nothing worked.
[599.14 → 601.04] I could see my mouse but couldn't do anything.
[601.20 → 601.92] Anything at all.
[601.98 → 603.08] Tried to recover the OS.
[603.56 → 603.98] Nothing.
[604.14 → 604.74] Not going to work.
[604.84 → 606.18] Set it error at every single time.
[606.86 → 607.90] Bad news bears.
[608.60 → 610.28] I switched to Mint to recover.
[610.42 → 612.98] Well, I did Mint live CD to recover my stuff.
[613.18 → 613.92] That worked.
[613.96 → 614.62] I got all my files.
[614.70 → 615.22] Sounds good.
[615.52 → 616.38] Installed Windows again.
[616.74 → 617.58] Did update again.
[617.90 → 618.62] Black screen again.
[619.34 → 619.68] Okay.
[620.18 → 621.80] Did Mint more permanently this time.
[622.24 → 623.48] Maybe it's because I checked updates.
[623.66 → 630.00] This is talking Windows 10 specifically, but I did notice when I checked the optional updates' thing.
[630.00 → 630.40] Yeah.
[630.48 → 630.90] I looked at it.
[631.00 → 631.94] There was preview.
[634.74 → 635.12] Oh.
[636.08 → 636.44] Interesting.
[636.54 → 638.60] I didn't put that together until literally right now.
[638.82 → 641.70] The crazy thing about this is they have the insider program.
[642.10 → 642.36] Yeah.
[642.44 → 649.76] Like they actually have a well-communicated formal program for this.
[649.76 → 654.90] Float plane stream quality seems to be all over the place in case you were just curious.
[655.50 → 658.58] So some users are getting literally like 23.
[658.72 → 665.96] Someone wrote they're getting 23 megabits a second down, which is pretty dumb for a live stream.
[666.04 → 667.14] If your connection can take it.
[667.14 → 667.46] Oof.
[667.46 → 667.86] Yeah.
[668.06 → 668.76] Then enjoy.
[668.96 → 673.28] But others are saying they have good connections, and it's like looking pretty inner.
[673.56 → 677.12] And mine, in fact, is looking a little soft right now.
[677.76 → 679.90] So it was looking really sharp before.
[680.04 → 681.16] I think AJ's in the chat.
[681.32 → 682.02] He's hanging out.
[682.04 → 682.80] He's looking at stuff.
[682.90 → 683.10] Yeah.
[683.10 → 684.20] Some people perfect.
[684.26 → 685.14] Look, look, look.
[685.18 → 685.48] Okay.
[686.78 → 688.86] You click the check for updates button.
[689.78 → 694.16] When you join Float plane, that's basically a big check for updates button.
[694.72 → 695.48] It's beta.
[695.60 → 696.06] It's beta.
[696.24 → 696.68] It's alpha.
[696.88 → 697.42] It's alpha.
[697.74 → 698.50] It's very alpha.
[698.62 → 702.34] It's very weird that people are getting like monstrous megabit down.
[703.24 → 707.96] But it's a mixture of things that right now there's no manual quality settings.
[708.02 → 710.40] So there's a mixture of things that determine what quality you're getting.
[711.06 → 712.30] Mine just sharpened up a little bit.
[712.30 → 714.46] Including viewport size and a few other things as well.
[714.62 → 715.14] Oh, really?
[715.32 → 715.70] Okay.
[716.08 → 716.52] Interesting.
[717.74 → 722.44] Someone just said they peaked at 32 megabits a second.
[723.74 → 726.20] That is ridiculous.
[726.20 → 729.82] I have no idea what's doing that, but AJ is here.
[730.42 → 730.58] Yeah.
[730.66 → 731.98] AJ is the hero.
[731.98 → 733.06] Full hero mode.
[733.56 → 734.04] Anyway.
[734.92 → 737.42] We haven't experienced that before on any of the tests either.
[737.64 → 738.14] What are you getting?
[738.14 → 738.62] Yeah.
[738.62 → 739.92] I'm way under.
[740.24 → 742.26] I'm way, way less than that.
[742.74 → 747.20] I'm receiving anywhere as low as 2, 6, 4.
[747.42 → 747.58] Yeah.
[747.82 → 748.76] It's a little better now.
[749.24 → 749.56] Anyway.
[749.56 → 752.90] Why don't we move on to our next news topic for the day.
[754.06 → 755.34] Leaks and launch.
[755.44 → 757.14] The Galaxy S10 is coming.
[757.64 → 765.72] And I am having a real hard time getting interested in another phone right now.
[766.86 → 767.22] Yeah.
[767.22 → 768.08] Because they're all really boring.
[768.56 → 769.50] Well, not just.
[769.50 → 770.46] And we just had a whole slew of them.
[770.46 → 771.46] Not just boring.
[772.98 → 782.44] Samsung was sort of my last hope for someone to not jump on this weird cutouts and holes
[782.44 → 784.30] in the display bandwagon.
[784.30 → 790.86] Like, I don't know about you, but when I first got a webcam, so this was quite a long time
[790.86 → 791.04] ago.
[791.10 → 796.34] When I first got a webcam, the mounting system for the particular one that I bought was not
[796.34 → 796.90] very good.
[797.60 → 803.50] And what happened was it kind of hung down a little bit in front of my screen, giving
[803.50 → 805.16] me, well, effectively, a notch.
[806.32 → 808.08] I thought it was stupid then.
[808.58 → 810.22] I think it's stupid now.
[810.22 → 816.14] Now, I have seen some relatively tasteful applications of the notch.
[816.20 → 817.70] Have you seen the OnePlus 6T?
[818.14 → 818.30] Yeah.
[818.70 → 819.86] The like, little swoop?
[820.50 → 822.12] I think it's a lot better.
[822.36 → 822.60] Yeah.
[824.02 → 831.30] But I am not a fan of the Infinity O display that is rumoured to be coming in the S10.
[831.38 → 836.12] I can't remember who said this, but someone wants to get, you know how we nicknamed the
[836.12 → 837.16] thingy a notch?
[837.16 → 841.30] I don't remember who said this, but they said this should be called the pimple.
[842.46 → 844.26] And I think that's kind of hilarious.
[846.74 → 847.28] Oh, yeah.
[847.28 → 848.30] That doesn't look good at all.
[848.42 → 850.00] Especially the S10+.
[850.00 → 851.18] Like, what the heck?
[853.64 → 854.00] So.
[854.34 → 854.82] Like, I get it.
[854.86 → 855.78] There are two things there.
[855.90 → 859.88] But, like, even if they made it, like, yeah, I don't know.
[860.40 → 862.84] It's just weird and useless, and I don't like it.
[862.84 → 868.58] Like, they could have just made the chin bar smaller again, and just, just, I don't know.
[868.78 → 869.26] I just.
[870.56 → 876.46] Now, yours might not be a very popular opinion, but you actually spent some time with a Pixel
[876.46 → 883.22] 3 XL, and you had your own experience with a pretty ridiculous notch.
[883.36 → 884.12] I didn't really mind it.
[884.12 → 886.74] Please do elaborate.
[887.36 → 888.88] That's honestly pretty much it.
[889.00 → 889.66] I didn't really care.
[891.04 → 892.08] It pretty much never.
[892.16 → 892.52] How?
[894.02 → 894.94] Why do you care?
[895.82 → 897.96] Because it doesn't have to be that way.
[898.74 → 901.06] What's wrong with the Note 9?
[901.42 → 903.70] Samsung already nailed it.
[903.90 → 905.02] They already nailed it.
[905.26 → 905.86] It's fine.
[905.98 → 906.76] It's fine exactly the way it is.
[906.76 → 907.82] I don't think it's a good thing.
[908.08 → 909.48] I'm not saying it's a positive thing.
[910.02 → 912.44] I don't wish it was on all my devices.
[913.00 → 914.24] It just doesn't really bother me.
[914.42 → 919.46] If they have to go that low, and honestly, Pixel devices, while I have enjoyed them very
[919.46 → 924.08] much because I really like stock Android, have never really been, other than their camera,
[924.40 → 928.28] have never really been, like, the bleeding edge of what can happen with a phone.
[928.68 → 929.38] Fair enough.
[929.42 → 929.86] You know what I mean?
[930.20 → 931.42] Software-wise, sure.
[932.02 → 933.20] Hardware-wise, meh.
[933.20 → 936.56] No, the bleeding edge is this.
[937.10 → 941.96] My phone including a selfie remote.
[943.32 → 943.76] That.
[944.52 → 945.84] That is the bleeding edge.
[946.16 → 948.70] That is literally the only thing I use this pen for.
[949.66 → 950.80] That's pretty funny, actually.
[951.80 → 954.90] Also, that one tweet that I sent where I put a bunch of question marks on it.
[956.66 → 957.30] All right.
[957.34 → 960.60] Well, why don't we walk through what's shaking with these phones here?
[960.70 → 961.82] I mean, there's some cool stuff.
[961.82 → 966.34] So there's going to be three versions, the S10, the S10 Lite, and the S10 Plus.
[966.52 → 969.08] So the 10 and the 10 Plus are rumoured to be curved.
[970.62 → 972.42] They are, wait, is this even, like, rumoured?
[972.96 → 973.62] Is this considered?
[973.68 → 973.92] Oh, yeah.
[973.98 → 975.38] These are maybe leaks?
[975.44 → 975.68] I don't know.
[975.70 → 975.88] Whatever.
[975.94 → 976.34] It doesn't matter.
[976.92 → 977.28] Sure.
[977.42 → 978.14] Let's call them rumours.
[978.14 → 982.34] So the S10 is going to have 128 or 512 gigs of storage.
[982.34 → 988.90] That is a lot of phone storage, making, in my opinion, micro SD expansion slot basically irrelevant.
[988.90 → 1001.80] So if we can move past needing to put SIM cards in our phones like a bunch of chimps from, you know, 1998 at some point, then we can do away with a tray that slides out of our phones, increasing their water resistance.
[1001.80 → 1006.36] It's going to be $7.99 or $9.99.
[1006.58 → 1008.46] This is in pounds, so I don't know how that translates.
[1008.46 → 1020.98] Usually the Europeans just kind of get fleeced on that conversion, so it'll probably be equivalent in U.S. dollars, even though the pound, last time I checked, I haven't paid attention to the whole, like, Brexit thing going on and what that's done to the currency.
[1021.14 → 1023.22] But last I checked, it was worth more than the USD.
[1023.66 → 1037.64] The S10 Plus is going to be 0.3 inches bigger and will have a 1 terabyte version along with 128 replacing the, oh, along with the 128 and 512 and go for as much as 1399 pounds.
[1037.64 → 1043.66] And then the S10 Lite will have a non-curved display, 128 gigs, and it'll be cheaper at $669.
[1043.72 → 1051.22] So still pretty pricey, but by the time you buy it on a two or three or a contract or whatever your carriers offer, you can have it pretty darn subsidized.
[1051.28 → 1053.00] You could probably get it for, like, a couple of hundred bucks.
[1053.60 → 1061.18] They are supposed to include headphone jacks, an in-screen ultrasonic fingerprint scanner, no iris scanner anymore.
[1061.28 → 1062.08] They're doing away with that.
[1062.08 → 1068.58] The iris scanner, it was cool, but it's, like, it's obviously a stepping stone.
[1068.70 → 1079.56] Like, that wasn't going to be the way forward unless they could figure out how to make a super fisheye lens on the front of the phone, high resolution enough to read your iris from anywhere.
[1079.78 → 1082.92] And that's, I don't know, maybe someday, but it's not realistic right now.
[1083.20 → 1083.28] Yeah.
[1083.42 → 1088.06] The ability to wirelessly charge other devices is something they're calling Power Share.
[1088.14 → 1089.30] Okay, have you seen this?
[1089.30 → 1090.22] Have you seen this?
[1090.64 → 1091.64] How they want to do this?
[1091.94 → 1092.34] No.
[1092.54 → 1093.56] It's like, put up your phone.
[1095.50 → 1097.06] We're sharing Power now, friend.
[1098.44 → 1099.40] I'm not even kidding.
[1099.54 → 1100.48] What is the point of that?
[1101.04 → 1105.64] This is literally the thing in my life that most often needs to be topped up.
[1105.76 → 1106.72] Why exactly do it?
[1106.98 → 1110.68] You have to, like, NFC PhotoS hare Power now.
[1111.54 → 1113.68] It's the greatest feature I've ever heard of.
[1114.66 → 1116.30] And apparently there are three cameras on the back.
[1116.30 → 1125.26] Okay, to be fair, if it didn't add to the cost, which, like, it's going to add to the cost, but if it didn't add to the cost, the ability to, like, kind of jumpstart someone?
[1125.44 → 1125.78] Sure.
[1125.94 → 1126.58] Kind of cool?
[1126.92 → 1127.30] Sure.
[1127.36 → 1127.84] I guess.
[1128.14 → 1128.32] Sure.
[1128.32 → 1130.02] I would probably have a battery bank on me.
[1130.38 → 1130.72] Sure.
[1131.30 → 1131.60] But.
[1132.00 → 1132.38] Sure.
[1132.94 → 1133.34] Yeah.
[1133.34 → 1137.04] But it's going to add to the cost.
[1137.16 → 1137.88] So, like, whatever.
[1138.20 → 1138.52] I don't know.
[1139.06 → 1140.14] You know what's fascinating?
[1140.36 → 1148.98] My, I have not run out of phone battery ever since I got a car with Android Auto because there's such a good reason to plug in my phone when I'm driving.
[1149.52 → 1152.76] And with, not even fast charge, I don't even use fast charge.
[1152.82 → 1155.00] I think it's, like, a 2-amp charger or something like that.
[1155.04 → 1155.78] Like, nothing special.
[1155.78 → 1166.80] But even with that, with how quickly phones charge these days, it's, like, kind of amazing, actually, because if I'm at, you know, 20% or whatever and I just drive somewhere for 10 minutes, it'll be at 35, 40.
[1167.40 → 1171.04] And, boom, I'm good for, like, a significant amount of the rest of the day.
[1171.04 → 1171.98] Yeah, you just get little pop-ups.
[1172.44 → 1176.06] And it's nice because that can actually extend the overall life of your phone as well.
[1176.20 → 1177.54] I'm saying that to the stream.
[1178.06 → 1180.36] So, random little flow plane update while you do that.
[1180.56 → 1182.90] We're at over 350 people live right now.
[1183.62 → 1183.84] Really?
[1183.84 → 1186.76] The average viewer is getting 4.4 megabit per second.
[1186.86 → 1191.54] The reason why people are seeing, like, 16 and stuff is because they're getting bursts.
[1192.70 → 1193.30] Got it.
[1193.42 → 1193.78] Gotcha.
[1194.26 → 1194.38] Yeah.
[1194.80 → 1197.82] And, actually, 4.4 isn't that low for a stream for the average viewer.
[1198.04 → 1198.72] Got it.
[1199.82 → 1200.82] All right.
[1201.48 → 1201.76] So.
[1202.14 → 1203.10] Because most people don't watch its source.
[1203.32 → 1206.24] We do need to have manual selections, though, so that people can choose to be higher.
[1206.74 → 1207.28] That would be.
[1207.80 → 1208.58] That would be good.
[1209.18 → 1211.08] When you're going to get high, it should be a choice.
[1212.76 → 1213.52] All right.
[1213.84 → 1216.80] iPhone sales.
[1217.12 → 1217.98] I'm tired.
[1219.12 → 1221.98] Like, because this week was tiring or?
[1222.30 → 1222.66] Yeah.
[1222.76 → 1225.18] It has been a tiring week.
[1225.64 → 1227.46] Like, I've hardly even seen this guy.
[1227.54 → 1231.66] We're, like, kind of back to that thing where, like, the entire week went by and I didn't even see you.
[1232.08 → 1232.32] Yeah.
[1232.32 → 1234.44] What is exciting in Luke land?
[1235.02 → 1235.76] In Luke land?
[1236.56 → 1238.00] It's, like, the place where Luke lives.
[1239.92 → 1241.14] My snowboard showed up.
[1241.64 → 1242.00] Nice.
[1242.24 → 1242.42] Yeah.
[1242.52 → 1243.06] That's cool.
[1243.26 → 1244.04] You got to go snowboarding.
[1244.36 → 1244.60] Yep.
[1244.90 → 1245.26] Definitely.
[1245.26 → 1247.46] Mine's ancient.
[1247.78 → 1248.88] It's from, like, when I was a teenager.
[1250.48 → 1251.94] Was I even a teenager yet?
[1252.00 → 1254.94] I think I got it before I moved in with my mom.
[1255.40 → 1256.24] So I was 11.
[1257.54 → 1258.72] I think I didn't get much taller.
[1259.18 → 1264.56] My snowboard was, I was just going to say, I still actually have my snowboard from when I was around then, too.
[1264.96 → 1266.50] And it just doesn't work for me anymore.
[1267.20 → 1268.34] The boots don't fit.
[1268.42 → 1269.28] It's not tall enough.
[1269.60 → 1270.42] But I keep it just in case.
[1270.42 → 1271.18] My boots still fit.
[1272.00 → 1273.56] You keep it just in case I need something?
[1274.00 → 1276.48] I was going to say other people, but it might be too big.
[1279.18 → 1279.86] I'm sorry.
[1282.74 → 1283.10] Okay.
[1283.24 → 1283.86] Anyway, anyway.
[1283.86 → 1285.82] Can you give me a Luke update that's not insulting?
[1286.62 → 1288.02] I don't have a ton.
[1288.08 → 1290.14] I can't necessarily talk about some of this stuff.
[1290.76 → 1292.66] I guess I can say float plane things.
[1292.86 → 1293.18] Yeah.
[1293.98 → 1296.10] Because the rest of it's, like, my grandpa stuff.
[1296.10 → 1296.78] I just don't want to.
[1297.22 → 1301.56] The float plane stuff is, no, that's still.
[1301.72 → 1303.66] I guess I can talk about the problems.
[1304.12 → 1304.46] Sure.
[1304.60 → 1304.80] Okay.
[1305.18 → 1306.34] So I'm trying to get a place.
[1307.22 → 1309.06] I've been living in a basement suite for a long time.
[1309.14 → 1311.76] I've been trying to buy accommodation of my own.
[1311.84 → 1312.68] Pretty nice basement suite.
[1313.18 → 1313.62] Yes.
[1313.80 → 1314.08] Yes.
[1314.18 → 1315.92] But it's accommodation of my own.
[1316.24 → 1316.50] So right.
[1316.70 → 1316.92] Oh.
[1317.22 → 1318.04] It's going down.
[1318.14 → 1318.38] All right.
[1318.42 → 1318.98] That's not great.
[1318.98 → 1319.46] Anyway.
[1320.34 → 1325.40] And my problem right now is Shaw is the only ISP available
[1325.40 → 1327.32] at the place that I want to go to.
[1327.84 → 1332.74] And Shaw's maximum commercial up or residential upload,
[1332.86 → 1337.00] if I remember correctly, is, like, 15 or 20 megabits per second up.
[1337.88 → 1341.62] And I don't want to deal with that because I want to stream and stuff.
[1342.02 → 1344.98] And Shaw has shown time and time again that they're not interested
[1344.98 → 1346.16] over the last many years.
[1346.16 → 1347.92] They're not interested in increasing that.
[1347.92 → 1350.78] It has to do with their infrastructure being more TV-based and whatever,
[1350.86 → 1351.00] whatever.
[1351.00 → 1353.34] So, like, it will never go up.
[1354.24 → 1358.00] They just doubled their download speed for everyone, almost everyone,
[1358.42 → 1359.84] but the upload didn't go up at all.
[1359.98 → 1360.12] Yeah.
[1360.14 → 1363.66] So you can get a connection that I think is, what, 600 megabits down
[1363.66 → 1364.76] and, like, 10 up?
[1364.80 → 1366.94] I'm pretty sure it's 600 down, 15 up.
[1367.04 → 1367.60] 15 up.
[1367.66 → 1368.58] Oh, oh, sorry.
[1368.70 → 1368.92] 15.
[1368.92 → 1376.48] You know, it's funny because I have been on our commercial connection here.
[1377.02 → 1380.04] So gigabit up, gigabit down for so long.
[1380.46 → 1381.62] Like, it has been.
[1381.72 → 1384.40] So we got fibre at the old office.
[1384.90 → 1388.28] That would have been, we've been in this building for three-plus years now.
[1388.34 → 1390.02] So that would have been, like, four and a half years ago.
[1390.10 → 1391.54] And that fibre was 150, 150.
[1391.54 → 1392.86] 150, 150.
[1393.22 → 1399.88] So it had been almost half a decade since I had uploaded a video to YouTube
[1399.88 → 1402.50] from a cable modem.
[1403.20 → 1403.38] Okay.
[1403.68 → 1407.56] So before I got fibre at my house, I have 300, 300 fibre at my house.
[1407.80 → 1408.52] Oh, that's great.
[1408.90 → 1411.60] Anyway, before I got the fibre in at my house, for some reason,
[1411.84 → 1416.12] I had to, like, transcode a WAN show or something,
[1416.36 → 1418.26] like the stream broke in the middle or something.
[1418.26 → 1420.80] I had to splice it together and then upload it.
[1421.08 → 1422.10] And I took it home to do it.
[1422.62 → 1423.72] And I clicked upload.
[1424.34 → 1425.82] And then I, like, sat there.
[1425.98 → 1430.10] And I expected to just sit at my computer and finish babysitting it
[1430.10 → 1431.40] and making sure that it went live.
[1432.56 → 1435.86] And then I checked the timer for it.
[1435.94 → 1438.34] And it was like, yeah, come back in two and a half hours.
[1438.56 → 1439.56] So Bob's like, what?
[1440.82 → 1441.74] What year is it?
[1441.78 → 1443.90] I was just going to say, it's like you go back quite a few years
[1443.90 → 1444.76] in terms of internet.
[1444.76 → 1448.70] And I was on their 300 down connection, which is now the 600 down.
[1448.76 → 1450.16] So I must have been 15 megabits up.
[1450.86 → 1453.84] Because that, 15 megabits, that's one and a half megabytes a second.
[1454.10 → 1456.74] So to upload 90 megabytes is a minute.
[1457.18 → 1461.76] So 900 megabytes would be 10 minutes.
[1462.06 → 1464.44] So then something like the WAN show,
[1464.54 → 1467.68] which is now I think a six and a half or eight gigabyte files
[1467.68 → 1468.90] or something stupid like that.
[1469.20 → 1469.92] Okay, fine.
[1469.98 → 1470.98] Maybe it wasn't two hours.
[1471.06 → 1471.82] Maybe it was an hour and a half.
[1471.88 → 1472.28] Doesn't matter.
[1472.28 → 1473.68] But the point is, that sucks.
[1474.40 → 1474.94] It's bad.
[1475.04 → 1476.50] And then you're going to have some fluctuations in that.
[1476.60 → 1479.94] And Shaw is somewhat shared in terms of their performance.
[1480.26 → 1481.98] So if you were trying to do that in a high time,
[1482.14 → 1483.64] it's going to be slower.
[1484.70 → 1486.26] So anyway, I'm not down.
[1486.34 → 1487.30] I'm not down at all.
[1487.50 → 1488.70] With Shaw connection, no.
[1488.94 → 1490.88] Especially if that's the only option, uh-uh.
[1491.00 → 1491.66] Not going to do it.
[1491.88 → 1494.56] And apparently, Shaw in this building was like,
[1494.62 → 1498.96] oh, we're going to give five years free internet 30 and basic cable.
[1498.96 → 1501.62] So Telus was like, we're just not going to go in there.
[1501.72 → 1502.52] No potential customers.
[1502.66 → 1504.36] So I'm trying to talk to Telus right now and be like,
[1504.46 → 1506.16] hey, there are some potential customers.
[1506.58 → 1507.04] Like me.
[1507.40 → 1509.36] And I'll get one of my two connections.
[1509.58 → 1510.22] Yeah, whatever.
[1510.40 → 1511.02] Just come on.
[1511.12 → 1511.92] Would you do it?
[1512.16 → 1512.50] Sure.
[1512.76 → 1513.32] Would you?
[1513.98 → 1514.80] Hold on a minute.
[1514.92 → 1517.36] Because like my internet bill is over 100 bucks a month.
[1517.50 → 1517.66] Yeah.
[1517.74 → 1518.18] 300, 300.
[1518.18 → 1520.16] Okay, so the reason why I said sure right away
[1520.16 → 1522.24] is because I've literally thought about this scenario already.
[1522.36 → 1522.62] Okay.
[1522.90 → 1523.30] Okay.
[1523.30 → 1528.12] So you would pay like 250 bucks a month.
[1528.94 → 1532.04] It'll be less than that, but it's still about 200 bucks a month.
[1532.08 → 1532.28] Okay.
[1532.36 → 1533.64] You would pay 200 bucks a month.
[1533.70 → 1536.50] If they were like, you know, you need to find six people.
[1536.62 → 1536.88] Okay.
[1536.92 → 1538.32] And you could only find five.
[1539.14 → 1542.68] You'd buy two to get fibre into the building.
[1542.82 → 1543.08] Yes.
[1543.40 → 1543.78] Because.
[1544.78 → 1546.28] Would you buy three?
[1547.42 → 1549.70] We're probably getting to a no at that point.
[1550.02 → 1551.18] Because what I'm doing is.
[1551.18 → 1552.68] You'd have 900 megabits.
[1552.68 → 1555.70] You could get like a teaming router.
[1555.94 → 1557.44] I have almost a gigabit connection.
[1557.62 → 1560.22] Because you know what you could do.
[1560.70 → 1562.40] So remember that video we did.
[1562.48 → 1562.58] Okay.
[1562.66 → 1562.88] Sorry.
[1562.88 → 1563.04] Sorry.
[1563.12 → 1563.64] I know I interrupted.
[1563.74 → 1564.14] Hold that thought.
[1564.20 → 1565.32] But this is cool.
[1565.60 → 1566.18] This is crazy.
[1566.30 → 1568.48] Because we're getting the 10 gig connection here.
[1568.92 → 1572.54] You remember that video we did with ITEM's bonding service?
[1572.96 → 1577.24] You could bond your connection through a VPN to the office.
[1577.38 → 1578.86] You could bond the connections.
[1578.86 → 1581.44] You're so close physically to it.
[1581.44 → 1582.12] Oh my god.
[1582.12 → 1584.28] That the latency hit wouldn't be that bad.
[1584.38 → 1586.44] You'd eat like three milliseconds, probably.
[1587.22 → 1588.20] Oh my god.
[1588.72 → 1589.96] That would be hilarious.
[1590.44 → 1590.62] That would be amazing.
[1590.62 → 1591.66] You'd have gigabit at home.
[1592.04 → 1592.74] Would you pay.
[1592.80 → 1594.76] If you could bond the connections for free.
[1594.80 → 1596.32] Because I wouldn't charge you to put something in the server room.
[1596.38 → 1596.76] I don't care.
[1596.82 → 1597.50] That'd be hilarious.
[1597.68 → 1598.60] We could do a video about it.
[1598.62 → 1599.28] What do I care?
[1599.62 → 1601.40] You wouldn't even be using it half the time.
[1601.60 → 1602.42] If that was.
[1602.46 → 1602.64] Yeah.
[1602.64 → 1602.98] So okay.
[1603.06 → 1604.70] If it was just like for funnies.
[1604.78 → 1605.10] No.
[1605.48 → 1607.76] But if it was like to get TELUS into the building.
[1608.04 → 1608.30] Yeah.
[1608.90 → 1609.24] Sure.
[1609.80 → 1610.48] You'd do it.
[1610.54 → 1610.74] Yeah.
[1610.94 → 1611.42] All right.
[1611.62 → 1611.98] Interesting.
[1612.98 → 1616.90] Mainly because that contract would have a time gate on it.
[1617.00 → 1618.96] And I would be able to not at some point.
[1618.98 → 1619.40] At some point.
[1619.50 → 1619.70] Yeah.
[1620.14 → 1620.54] At some point.
[1620.54 → 1621.00] Because okay.
[1621.00 → 1622.48] My issue is right now.
[1622.64 → 1624.10] That place is actually a perfect deal.
[1624.46 → 1624.74] Yeah.
[1624.92 → 1628.70] So that increased monthly would still technically make that place worth it.
[1628.90 → 1629.22] Sure.
[1629.44 → 1629.72] Got it.
[1629.72 → 1630.06] If that makes sense.
[1630.16 → 1630.28] Got it.
[1630.28 → 1631.56] That's the reasoning behind it.
[1631.64 → 1632.04] Got it.
[1632.10 → 1632.50] Got it.
[1632.50 → 1632.92] Got it.
[1632.96 → 1635.12] If I had to get the other place I'm looking at.
[1635.20 → 1636.46] I would not do that regardless.
[1636.70 → 1637.18] Got it.
[1637.18 → 1637.56] Got it.
[1637.64 → 1638.36] Because it's not as worth it.
[1639.16 → 1639.56] Ah.
[1640.06 → 1641.10] I'm having fun.
[1641.20 → 1642.00] I'm having fun.
[1642.14 → 1644.84] But all good things must come to a pause.
[1645.64 → 1646.40] Not an end.
[1646.58 → 1647.34] The show is not over.
[1647.36 → 1648.30] These are still good things.
[1648.30 → 1651.74] Let's tell you guys about Moss Backpacks.
[1651.90 → 1652.86] This is the new one.
[1653.14 → 1653.50] Is it?
[1653.68 → 1653.82] Yes.
[1653.82 → 1654.02] Oh.
[1654.08 → 1654.92] I haven't been briefed on this.
[1654.92 → 1655.94] This is the previous one.
[1656.06 → 1657.22] This was my briefing.
[1657.60 → 1658.20] And then this.
[1658.20 → 1661.44] This is the slightly even older version of this one.
[1661.50 → 1663.20] But this is the one that I actually daily drive.
[1663.28 → 1665.32] So that makes it easier I guess.
[1665.40 → 1665.56] No.
[1665.66 → 1666.16] That's the.
[1666.38 → 1666.66] Oh.
[1666.76 → 1668.00] This is the old Grande.
[1668.36 → 1668.62] Wait.
[1668.70 → 1669.56] Is this bigger than mine?
[1670.36 → 1670.86] I don't even know.
[1670.86 → 1671.14] Is that.
[1671.20 → 1671.96] Do you have a Grande?
[1672.20 → 1672.84] I don't know.
[1673.64 → 1674.00] No.
[1674.16 → 1675.14] I don't know if you do.
[1675.20 → 1675.90] I don't have a Grande.
[1676.02 → 1676.94] I have a smaller one.
[1677.12 → 1677.44] Okay.
[1678.28 → 1678.70] Shut up.
[1678.76 → 1679.02] Anyway.
[1679.10 → 1679.78] This is updated.
[1680.02 → 1681.12] December 2018.
[1681.66 → 1682.90] This is the new Grande.
[1683.18 → 1683.48] Okay.
[1683.48 → 1684.46] That's the previous Grande.
[1684.56 → 1685.36] You can put that one away.
[1685.36 → 1687.18] Apparently it was so we could compare differences.
[1687.48 → 1687.76] But like.
[1687.86 → 1688.08] Nope.
[1688.12 → 1688.80] We aren't going to do that.
[1688.84 → 1689.10] Okay.
[1689.48 → 1691.12] You can't buy the old one any more anyway.
[1691.32 → 1692.46] So there's a pocket there.
[1692.88 → 1693.94] There's a pocket there.
[1694.06 → 1695.50] I use this pocket for my screwdriver.
[1695.86 → 1700.76] And I use this pocket for when I accidentally forget to take my microphone and my Teleprompter
[1700.76 → 1702.48] remote out of my pocket at the end of the day.
[1702.48 → 1704.52] And I put it here so everyone knows.
[1704.64 → 1705.52] All the shooters know.
[1706.24 → 1707.78] If Linus took the mic off.
[1707.78 → 1707.96] They can't find it.
[1708.02 → 1708.34] Check there.
[1708.36 → 1709.14] They can find it here.
[1709.94 → 1713.04] That's a fantastic pocket to have like dedicated to that.
[1713.16 → 1714.12] One thing I want to point out.
[1714.18 → 1716.40] I point this out every single time but just in case you haven't seen the show before.
[1716.70 → 1717.42] The orange.
[1717.88 → 1719.06] The orange is amazing.
[1719.14 → 1719.92] It zips down more.
[1720.66 → 1725.04] The orange makes it so that like shiny reflective bright orange.
[1725.36 → 1727.26] You can easily see into the bottom of here.
[1727.56 → 1730.42] If I put my wallet in there.
[1730.42 → 1733.20] You can easily see that the wallet is there.
[1733.74 → 1734.08] Yeah.
[1734.14 → 1737.40] Your old Aver key bag was orange on the inside too if I recall correctly.
[1737.70 → 1739.30] And that's like that's key.
[1739.56 → 1741.28] It's really helpful with finding stuff.
[1741.30 → 1741.76] Speaking of key.
[1741.98 → 1745.02] I keep my USB keys in this zippered pocket in mine.
[1745.24 → 1745.72] That makes sense.
[1745.82 → 1747.86] I don't have these I don't think.
[1748.36 → 1749.54] So that's cool I guess.
[1749.54 → 1750.76] I might have to switch my backpack.
[1750.94 → 1751.90] I keep a mouse in here.
[1752.06 → 1755.02] But this one has the power feature so you can plug in.
[1755.14 → 1755.82] Which is actually really cool.
[1755.82 → 1756.66] What do you want Jon?
[1757.22 → 1757.98] Lower third.
[1758.26 → 1759.46] Well you know what?
[1759.46 → 1760.62] But Moss is cool.
[1760.70 → 1761.14] They don't care.
[1761.48 → 1761.68] They're down.
[1761.68 → 1765.56] Hey you can save 25% using offer code LinusTech25.
[1765.92 → 1767.62] Which is the same as the percentage that you're saving.
[1767.74 → 1768.28] Easy to remember.
[1768.44 → 1769.56] I don't know what this other side's for.
[1769.64 → 1771.60] But it's kind of like plastic-y.
[1771.68 → 1774.20] So maybe it's supposed to be for a water bottle in case you get a little leak.
[1774.34 → 1774.82] I think so.
[1774.82 → 1779.02] And then finally you've got boom.
[1779.24 → 1784.14] A built-in battery bank slash charger doodad with type C and type A ports.
[1784.76 → 1785.98] And mine has all this stuff.
[1786.18 → 1789.48] But frankly I ripped it out because I don't really charge stuff in my bag.
[1791.64 → 1792.52] But you can do that.
[1792.64 → 1792.74] Sure.
[1792.84 → 1794.28] And then you can just put other stuff in the pouches.
[1794.32 → 1795.50] Some people love that functionality.
[1795.50 → 1795.74] Yep.
[1796.44 → 1797.68] I just I don't really care.
[1797.80 → 1798.14] It's fine.
[1798.30 → 1798.66] But I don't care.
[1798.66 → 1798.84] That's fine.
[1799.04 → 1802.96] So you can use offer code LinusTech25 at MossOrganizer.com until Christmas.
[1803.32 → 1807.66] Oh it's 25 because it's 25% off and Christmas is December 25th.
[1807.78 → 1808.22] Oh.
[1808.22 → 1809.70] So get this.
[1809.78 → 1810.14] Get this.
[1810.18 → 1810.32] Sorry.
[1810.36 → 1813.42] I'm going to move our sponsor stuff away because this is going to get a little bit political.
[1813.82 → 1814.18] Oh.
[1815.32 → 1815.78] Okay.
[1816.30 → 1824.36] Apparently there's a school in Vancouver that is banning candy canes because the red symbol
[1824.36 → 1827.10] and the J symbolize the blood of Jesus.
[1829.46 → 1829.94] Okay.
[1830.42 → 1834.50] So I don't normally like get real.
[1835.30 → 1836.16] Is that even bad?
[1836.16 → 1837.90] When you go to church don't you like.
[1839.54 → 1843.54] Well the point is that it's upsetting to people who don't go to church.
[1844.54 → 1845.80] Not people who do.
[1845.94 → 1846.08] Oh.
[1846.56 → 1846.90] Yeah.
[1847.08 → 1847.58] No, no yes.
[1847.68 → 1853.40] That's sort of like one of the fundamental you know blood of the Christ and the flesh
[1853.40 → 1855.16] of the all of that all of that kind of stuff.
[1855.18 → 1856.12] So other people can't.
[1856.12 → 1866.08] So other people are mad because candy canes are in the skew and if anyone who's involved
[1866.08 → 1868.70] in this decision is watching I think you're an idiot.
[1869.38 → 1871.02] I just want to throw that out there.
[1874.72 → 1876.66] There's nothing wrong with wearing turbans.
[1876.86 → 1879.08] There's nothing wrong with eating candy canes.
[1879.26 → 1879.42] Yep.
[1879.42 → 1882.08] Because it doesn't matter.
[1883.46 → 1886.00] If you disagree you're actually stupid.
[1887.34 → 1887.90] All right.
[1888.44 → 1890.10] Why don't we move on to our next sponsor.
[1891.80 → 1893.42] This is something we can all agree on.
[1893.62 → 1894.72] Savage jerky is delicious.
[1894.94 → 1895.30] It is.
[1895.50 → 1896.82] I'm going to have some teriyaki.
[1897.56 → 1900.16] Do you want actually you know what I'm going to go with some habanero buffalo sauce.
[1900.28 → 1901.22] I don't think I've tried this one before.
[1901.22 → 1901.60] I've seen that either.
[1902.20 → 1903.08] It's been opened.
[1903.40 → 1904.50] So someone got into it.
[1904.64 → 1905.86] Colton was probably like what is this?
[1905.96 → 1906.56] Probably Colton.
[1906.70 → 1906.96] What is this?
[1907.12 → 1907.58] Or Jon.
[1907.68 → 1912.16] Savage jerky is made with high quality ingredients without nitrates or preservatives with the
[1912.16 → 1915.80] goal of creating a snack that's full of flavour and spice, but that isn't bad for you.
[1915.86 → 1917.34] They've got 13 different flavours of jerky.
[1920.48 → 1921.68] I think this is a hot one.
[1922.14 → 1922.76] It's pretty hot.
[1923.18 → 1925.38] Like their sriracha bacon and maple buffalo bacon.
[1925.50 → 1926.08] That's my favourite.
[1926.20 → 1928.50] They make barbecue sauces, hot sauces and a spice rub.
[1928.50 → 1932.26] And their Carolina Reaper hot sauce uses one of the hottest peppers in the world.
[1932.36 → 1933.04] The Carolina Reaper.
[1933.52 → 1937.52] You can use offer code LTT to save 10% at Savage Jerky.
[1938.80 → 1939.20] Boom.
[1939.40 → 1939.92] That one's good.
[1940.74 → 1942.00] Actually it's not that hot.
[1942.10 → 1942.52] I like it.
[1942.66 → 1943.18] It's just hot.
[1943.34 → 1943.84] It's got the.
[1944.24 → 1944.44] Yeah.
[1945.44 → 1946.64] That's actually at a perfect level of heat.
[1946.64 → 1947.20] It doesn't overdo it.
[1947.62 → 1952.24] If you like spice but not like.
[1952.24 → 1953.36] You also like to taste things.
[1953.58 → 1953.78] Yeah.
[1953.92 → 1955.64] I think it's at a perfect spot for that.
[1955.74 → 1956.22] That's really nice.
[1956.22 → 1956.82] Because it's really.
[1956.96 → 1958.60] You've got the heat but like it's fine.
[1958.66 → 1959.78] I don't think I've tried this one before.
[1959.86 → 1961.00] I definitely haven't.
[1961.18 → 1961.38] Hmm.
[1963.50 → 1963.84] That's good.
[1963.86 → 1964.68] It's used with buffalo sauce.
[1964.78 → 1965.92] Anything with buffalo sauce.
[1966.46 → 1970.90] Like have you ever tasted anything with buffalo sauce on it that's not good?
[1971.04 → 1971.72] Actually yes.
[1971.92 → 1972.32] Unfortunately.
[1972.50 → 1973.04] Oh what was it?
[1973.18 → 1974.38] It was a rack of ribs.
[1976.06 → 1978.08] You had buffalo ribs that sucked?
[1978.26 → 1978.48] Yeah.
[1979.32 → 1980.20] Not at our house.
[1980.36 → 1980.64] No.
[1981.02 → 1981.42] No.
[1981.66 → 1981.90] No.
[1981.98 → 1982.60] Those were wonderful.
[1983.02 → 1984.34] They weren't buffalo, but they were good.
[1984.34 → 1985.92] Whatever they were fantastic.
[1986.18 → 1986.44] I just.
[1986.66 → 1986.80] Yeah.
[1986.88 → 1987.00] No.
[1987.04 → 1987.42] That was not.
[1987.56 → 1988.70] That was a completely different thing.
[1988.92 → 1989.18] Wow.
[1989.26 → 1989.50] Who just.
[1989.62 → 1990.38] Wasn't these either.
[1990.50 → 1991.36] Who just saw that one coming?
[1991.56 → 1991.76] Yeah.
[1991.88 → 1992.18] I know.
[1992.38 → 1992.62] Well no.
[1992.66 → 1993.54] These are clearly not ribs.
[1993.64 → 1993.82] I think.
[1993.92 → 1994.44] I don't think anyone.
[1994.76 → 1995.58] I was just making sure.
[1995.62 → 1996.92] I don't think anyone thought you were going there with it.
[1996.92 → 1997.10] Dude.
[1997.10 → 1998.66] People wanted to ban candy canes.
[1998.66 → 1999.42] I.

[2044.34 → 2049.86] time while they were over there china's constantly in like this sort of arms race with VPN providers
[2049.86 → 2053.62] um, but they were able to actually like to check their email periodically which is better than
[2054.42 → 2059.70] nothing yeah um their apps include DNS leak protection and ipv6 leak protection they have
[2059.70 → 2063.30] an internet kill switch that will block all traffic if the VPN becomes disconnected and
[2063.30 → 2071.78] you can check it out today at leg.GG forward slash Pia wan or also like this thing which is
[2071.78 → 2078.42] even worse yeah yeah we should we really still like it's possible he even set up the shortener now
[2079.14 → 2084.66] we should just shorten her that ourselves we should oh well it's just the graphic that's bad okay all
[2084.66 → 2092.10] right iPhone sales speaking of china halted in China a Chinese court this is originally posted by die
[2092.10 → 2097.38] hard on the forum and the original article is from Reuters a Chinese court I thought that was rooters
[2097.38 → 2103.46] until like two years ago I had never heard anyone say it's not rooters it's Reuters you said Reuters i
[2103.46 → 2109.54] thought that was literally a different website that I hadn't necessarily seen nope okay I know i just
[2109.54 → 2113.86] only seen it in text like I'd read any of it but i never I've heard it but I thought it was just a
[2113.86 → 2118.18] different website I don't really listen to video and I don't have a cable subscription so I don't watch
[2118.18 → 2125.62] like TV news I have to explain to people all the time that I don't watch shows very often like I'm
[2125.62 → 2130.18] usually going to do something instead and that's apparently super weird but all right well even me
[2130.18 → 2133.86] I'll like to make like a family guy reference or something from like back in the first few seasons
[2133.86 → 2137.78] when it was perfect and like everyone was watching it I don't know if it was that good it
[2137.78 → 2143.86] seemed good at the time it was pretty big then it was big it was at least big yeah and I'm like
[2143.86 → 2152.74] and you're like I just don't really watch shows I don't know so I take so much flag
[2154.26 → 2163.86] for talking like a valley girl do you even notice what okay on our typical videos okay
[2164.74 → 2170.42] where it's sort of mostly our subscribers watching there's nothing there's nothing about the earrings
[2170.42 → 2176.02] there's nothing about he's probably gay there's nothing about valley girl speak but when our
[2176.02 → 2182.66] videos get picked up by the algorithm, and they start to sort of spread yeah yeah a great example was the
[2182.66 → 2190.90] uh the uh uh stealing tampons from the Amazon Go store so it was hilarious because all of a sudden it
[2190.90 → 2196.82] was like going back 10 years in time like early yeah to when I first started uploading videos
[2196.82 → 2204.18] yeah and the comment section was super predictable it was like all these voice is annoying yeah
[2204.42 → 2209.86] um my hair wasn't as bad then, so there weren't as many comments about that it's worse now um
[2211.06 → 2216.74] and uh anyway, so there was one that recently that kind of managed to go outside our usual
[2216.74 → 2224.42] sphere of viewers that that watch it, and it was the Walmart gaming pc and I had wanted to ask do you even
[2224.42 → 2231.22] notice not even remotely huh I have never thought that at any point in time and I brought it up because
[2232.34 → 2238.58] just before I brought it up the reason that I thought of it was I said like probably at least
[2238.58 → 2243.78] every third word over a span of about 15 words and i kind of caught myself doing it and I was like
[2245.46 → 2254.18] huh i no I've never, but you got to also consider like our age group said like a lot
[2254.42 → 2261.86] we did it was like a thing to do that that wasn't just Jesus Christ that wasn't just a Val oh sorry
[2261.86 → 2267.86] candy can you can say that, but no candy can yeah um it wasn't just a valley girl level thing that was
[2267.86 → 2274.50] a like uh a popular thing to do at that point in time regardless of being valley girl or not
[2274.50 → 2278.10] someone said you don't seem valley girl, but you do seem western Canada I'm like well yeah
[2278.10 → 2281.06] yeah yeah for sure I was like well yeah
[2283.06 → 2286.58] hmm yeah maybe the problem is I do too
[2289.14 → 2295.14] so maybe that's why I don't notice it but like okay I don't know ah yeah maybe that's it maybe
[2295.14 → 2301.22] that's what's going on um remember when I used to edit your videos yes, and you would comment like
[2301.22 → 2305.54] sorry you have to listen to my voice and I was like I don't get it I don't care yeah like i never
[2305.54 → 2310.42] I've never noticed any of that yeah I don't even think your voice is particularly high
[2311.38 → 2316.42] but apparently I'm just objectively wrong about that so like it's pretty bad I don't know you
[2316.42 → 2322.18] know I experimented for a while hosting videos in a slightly lower register so it came from
[2322.18 → 2328.34] one that I hosted when I was sick yeah yeah and what I did was I experimented with delivering a
[2328.34 → 2333.22] little bit more like this like I don't like it I don't like it a bit more bass I don't like it and
[2333.22 → 2338.66] a lot of people noticed and some of them said wow this is an amazing improvement all of a sudden
[2338.66 → 2344.10] I can actually listen to these videos but the majority of the people who commented on it were
[2344.10 → 2351.94] actually upset they were like no i like chihuahua liners when he's all like what it's just it's
[2351.94 → 2359.30] it feels very disingenuous to me, it people said it felt really sterile yeah more like I was a presenter
[2359.30 → 2363.94] reading the script that had been provided to me as though I didn't fully understand it you sound
[2363.94 → 2370.42] almost radio yeah maybe a little bit more I mean I still don't think I have a radio voice but uh
[2371.54 → 2378.98] you know face maybe voice no uh let's move on we wanted to talk about the whole like Chinese thing
[2378.98 → 2385.54] right iPhone sales vaulted so a Chinese court has ordered a sales ban of select iPhone models in China
[2385.54 → 2390.42] for violating two patents of the chipmaker Qualcomm inc though intellectual property lawyers
[2390.42 → 2397.06] said enforcement of the ban was still likely a distant threat the case is part of a global patent
[2397.06 → 2402.26] dispute between apple and Qualcomm that includes dozens of lawsuits apple said it's filed a request
[2402.26 → 2409.54] for reconsideration with the court the first step in a long appeal process the fuzz intermediate
[2409.54 → 2414.58] people's court found apple infringed two Qualcomm patents and ordered an immediate ban on sales of iPhone
[2414.58 → 2419.62] models from the 6s through to the 10. China Hong Kong and Taiwan are apple's third-largest market
[2419.62 → 2425.78] accounting for about one-fifth of their total 265 and a half oh sorry billion in sales in the most
[2425.78 → 2432.66] recent fiscal year so um there's a little bit of commentary here that this could be a political play
[2432.66 → 2437.30] because apple is a direct competitor to some of the biggest companies in China whereas Qualcomm is a
[2437.30 → 2443.46] supplier so you can see them siding with them there but um i mean frankly i wouldn't be surprised if this
[2443.46 → 2448.66] just ends up being kind of an attempt to waste time more than anything else like i don't really
[2448.66 → 2452.74] understand the purpose of this kind of thing yeah so already it's from the success through to the 10
[2452.74 → 2456.66] the appeal process will take i mean i don't know if the Chinese courts are as slow as the ones over
[2456.66 → 2461.30] here but i suspect they probably are a very long uh i don't know then again i did watch the Beijing
[2461.30 → 2466.02] Olympics opening ceremonies man look pretty efficient to me but you never know so if they take
[2466.02 → 2471.62] anywhere near as long as it is here by the time apple were ever to have to actually pay anything or a
[2471.62 → 2476.74] sales ban were to actually go in effect um those models would probably be EOL and therefore
[2476.74 → 2481.22] completely irrelevant so i mean we saw a really similar thing happen with some of the early galaxy
[2481.22 → 2487.06] models where by the time apple managed to force uh Samsung to stop selling them in North America they
[2487.06 → 2494.98] were outdated and replaced by newer ones anyway i mean that's the that's sort of it's just one of
[2494.98 → 2502.74] the ways in which the patent system has failed us due to the pace of modern technology there are many
[2502.74 → 2505.86] ways if you didn't understand that illusion because you don't like candy canes
[2510.10 → 2513.62] i don't even like candy canes i mean I'm not even defending candy canes because i like them, i think
[2513.62 → 2517.94] they're stupid candy they're not very good and when i first heard that candy canes were being banned in
[2517.94 → 2526.82] the school i actually agreed i was like oh it's probably a danger thing like between either
[2527.94 → 2532.98] sharpening up the one end and like stabbing someone with it or taking the u end putting it in a fist and
[2532.98 → 2540.18] like really messing someone up because that could be done you know you punch some soft tissue with that
[2540.18 → 2545.54] like even if it didn't stay completely sharp you could definitely do some damage i was like oh yeah that
[2545.54 → 2551.30] makes sense and then i was talking to my wife about it, and she's like no, no no it's because it's like
[2551.30 → 2559.14] a religious symbol I'm just like i never even put that together well pretty much everything Christmas
[2559.86 → 2566.50] i know but like the j and the wood like whoa that may not even be what it is but that just might
[2566.50 → 2572.18] be why people are mad about it sure okay why not you know what I'm going to google this uh oh someone on
[2572.18 → 2577.70] float plane chat just asked where do i buy that shirt i know I've been wearing this shirt for
[2577.70 → 2585.14] literally months and there's been nowhere to buy it yeah um we have a huge shipment you've seen Nick's
[2585.14 → 2590.74] office right yes it's full of boxes and boxes and boxes of these shirts we're going to have a new store
[2590.74 → 2598.98] it's going to be on ltdstore.com we've been oops hard at work on this for a very, very long time it has
[2598.98 → 2605.86] taken too long, but that's a whole other conversation um but pretty much what happened was we weren't
[2605.86 → 2614.50] happy with either the speed of delivery or the quality of the printing or the service or whatever
[2614.50 → 2620.26] else from any of the merge providers that we've dealt with for one reason or another we have ended
[2620.26 → 2625.54] up switching every time, and so we finally went you know what this is going to be a lot of work and
[2625.54 → 2631.70] it has been a lot of work, but we're just going to find a way to do merch fulfillment ourselves so
[2631.70 → 2639.38] over on ltdstore.com right now you can pre-order the scam USB drive which is actually 32 gigs it's from
[2639.38 → 2645.38] Kingston uh but says one terabyte on it because we're funny uh so we alluded to this in one of our
[2645.38 → 2649.38] recent videos this is just kind of like a collector's item so you can get one if you want or you
[2649.38 → 2654.34] can not get one if you don't want it's a pre-order just please note, but it's like it's a Kingston USB
[2654.34 → 2657.46] drive you know exactly what you're getting apparently someone in the flow plane chat bought
[2657.46 → 2663.78] one oh really all right well there you go um and very soon and Nick is standing there presumably with
[2663.78 → 2670.02] an update you will be able to buy this shirt oh uh sure that's not why you're here it's still DVD no
[2670.02 → 2676.10] i was just oh it's after six I'm supposed to be gone but I'm not shirts DVD uh what is not DVD
[2676.10 → 2681.38] are they up they're not up, but they're very, very soon oh yeah so also coming is cable ties do you
[2681.38 → 2686.42] want to bring that there's a cable tie here oh do you want me to go get you to your packs' no it's
[2686.42 → 2692.26] okay so we're going to have packs of 10 20 they're packs of 20 sorry they're LTT you can't see these at
[2692.26 → 2697.94] all I'm sorry whatever you still can't see them they say LTT on the end i was going to go bring them to
[2697.94 → 2703.14] the camera, but it'll be super out of focus yeah honestly, honestly they're nothing super amazing
[2703.14 → 2710.10] they're just nice cable ties they look clean just so you guys know it's its a white box with LTT in
[2710.10 → 2716.26] if there's also orange ones there are orange ones well they have orange printing oh cool is it orange
[2716.26 → 2720.90] printing like the yeah okay so it's clear it's orange i forgot about those they're way more
[2720.90 → 2727.14] limited oh okay we don't have many of those i think it's like 10 or orange or something oh are they like
[2727.14 → 2731.86] supposed to be limited edition, or we just didn't think they'd sell as well uh i think we just kind of
[2731.86 → 2736.58] played it a bit more safe on those all right apparently we played it safe on the orange ones
[2736.58 → 2741.62] who would want you know orange ones actually i think i was in on that decision okay
[2742.42 → 2748.26] you've been in on most of these decisions yes so if i don't like them i have only myself to blame and nick
[2748.26 → 2756.34] and Lloyd and dad but mainly uh what can I do for you oh okay are you guys still streaming yeah yeah
[2756.34 → 2761.22] a little bit yeah we're like in the middle of the Walsh yeah we started super late we're

[2782.34 → 2790.02] sale including Fortnite and pub g developers of the other 11 have been told that they need to make
[2790.02 → 2797.54] adjustments to remove controversial content everyone was either banned or had gone back and
[2797.54 → 2804.02] retool your game demanded the authorities have voiced concerns about the violent nature of some titles
[2804.02 → 2808.26] as well as expressed worries about the activity being addictive
[2811.14 → 2815.38] so in fairness to China um
[2818.26 → 2820.66] should Fortnite be banned no I'm just kidding
[2821.78 → 2828.02] the author uh so President Xi Jinping has also called for kids more to be done to tackle a rise in
[2828.02 → 2832.90] nearsightedness among the young something that the children the country's ministry of education has
[2832.90 → 2838.50] linked to children playing video games at the cost of spending time on outdoor pastimes okay parent
[2838.50 → 2844.58] your kids and what does the Chinese government mean exactly by inharmonious chat room they wouldn't
[2844.58 → 2850.66] like twitch is twitched no twitch isn't over there right that can't be no, no yeah i mean anything with
[2850.66 → 2854.98] live chat is pretty tough over there isn't if it's got to be pretty banned yeah pretty censored and stuff
[2854.98 → 2858.58] has this story been like confirmed because when i saw it yesterday it was like
[2858.58 → 2865.54] super like Excel spreadsheet oh yeah and i saw some people being like i haven't actually seen them talk
[2865.54 → 2871.86] about this at all so who knows if it's real but i wouldn't be surprised okay it looks pretty there's an
[2871.86 → 2877.94] edit on Reddit that says uh it has been brought to the original poster's attention that blizzard posted
[2877.94 → 2882.50] an announcement on their official web uh denying that they've received notice for action needed on their
[2882.50 → 2890.26] games, but that has since been deleted huh so like is it they're not supposed to talk about it the
[2890.26 → 2895.46] Chinese community has been somewhat divided with some accepting this list as believable and others
[2895.46 → 2901.06] saying it's probably fake since anyone could make it uh yeah it's its just like you were saying it's
[2901.06 → 2906.66] not even it's just it's just a table and so like this could actually be terrible for blizzard in a lot of
[2906.66 → 2913.70] ways because it said in there Diablo was because of like inharmonious chat no, no it was because of
[2913.70 → 2920.90] like there was gambling or something game missions include fraud okay uh yes that's what it was um and
[2920.90 → 2925.86] didn't they just announce that they're doing like a Diablo mobile game because Chinese mobile market is like
[2926.42 → 2934.02] huge yeah fascinating immortal was like specifically for china, and they just also happened to include America
[2934.02 → 2939.38] because they're like, and you might like it too apparently no and not at all but that's like how
[2939.38 → 2947.62] that went down oh my goodness racer has an app that uses your GPU to mine crypto and apparently keeps
[2947.62 → 2952.90] the coins, so this is posted by cinnabar sonar on the forum do you get like racer points or something so
[2952.90 → 2958.02] the app is called soft miner a desktop app that utilizes the idle GPU processing power of gamers battle
[2958.02 → 2963.78] stations to solve complex blockchain based puzzles on the back end racer rewards the owner of the pc
[2963.78 → 2968.58] running the app with racer silver which can only be used to buy digital goods from racer
[2969.70 → 2975.22] racer says in their soft miner FAQ racer silver is not a cryptocurrency it is a loyalty rewards program
[2976.34 → 2981.14] we work with crypto mining technology to harness your computer's GPU and in turn we award you with
[2981.14 → 2985.54] silver giving you access to racer's ecosystem and suite of rewards
[2985.54 → 2988.02] um
[2988.02 → 2993.38] possibly controversial who cares really what who cares don't run it
[2995.38 → 3001.62] what if you don't realize like what if you how do you not realize that because you're against candy canes
[3003.14 → 3005.46] sorry yeah because you're against candy canes
[3005.46 → 3012.26] i think it is very realistic to think that there are many people who do not understand crypto well enough
[3012.26 → 3017.38] to know that racer is taking their money and then giving them racer bucks, but you could but i mean
[3017.38 → 3023.46] that isn't that basically the whole crypto thing anyway you could like uh oh Geez go
[3025.06 → 3029.94] are these all the white ones oh these are the orange ones oh you got orange ones i got white yeah here
[3031.86 → 3037.62] thanks oh you dumped it on the table yeah, so the orange one looks like that there's a like orange thing on
[3037.62 → 3043.06] the end, and it says LTT and then the white one is more likely to go with your RGB system because it's
[3043.06 → 3047.22] just white that's true but especially if your cable managing behind the back i think it would be
[3047.22 → 3052.02] really cool to have the orange ones we actually went through quite a few like it's amazing how hard
[3052.02 → 3057.38] it is to get something done with china in China like its cheap yeah like it's affordable, but there's
[3057.38 → 3063.38] a lot of time that you end up spending just to get something printed that's quality and looks
[3063.38 → 3068.98] acceptable and arrives on time and is like packaged reasonably nicely and like all this kind of
[3068.98 → 3076.66] stuff so we're expecting these to go live next few days in the next few days so just to give context
[3076.66 → 3081.30] they can't really hear you very well to give context that like takes a while i think we tried working
[3081.30 → 3087.06] with like, or we got samples from four different factories yeah, and we got like two levels of samples
[3087.06 → 3091.70] from each and picked like the best one from all of that some of them were pretty garbage but these
[3091.70 → 3096.66] ones are like actually not usable but these i wouldn't call them the best cable ties I've ever
[3096.66 → 3102.58] used but i can't think of anything that's better like they're good so we were comfortable
[3102.58 → 3107.06] putting the brand on them, and they look pretty nice so yeah yeah i like the orange ones i would try to
[3107.06 → 3111.86] get those if i were you guys the orange ones are dope you're going to make you're making it hard for us
[3111.86 → 3117.22] to sell 90 of our inventory Luke way to go I'm just trying to make people go fast speaking of way to go

[3148.98 → 3156.02] float plane chat oh Lord uh okay stew i says speaking of Samsung what do you guys think of
[3156.02 → 3160.66] recent news the Samsung Galaxy gold being priced at 1800 us dollars is more specifically what i should
[3160.66 → 3166.34] have said i think it's a matter of time before the actual smartphone manufacturers the Samsung's and
[3166.34 → 3172.02] apples of the world i think it's a matter of time before they clue in that third parties are already
[3172.02 → 3177.06] reselling their phones for six thousand dollars with goofy skins built into them and just do it
[3177.06 → 3183.94] themselves yes this is happening uh Jake asks new tech showdown i don't think so i don't think

[3202.66 → 3211.14] um okay please make a compensator 3.0 we don't even know what we would put in if it's they kind of
[3211.14 → 3219.14] that's not really like a thing any more really first our average video is basically compensator 17
[3219.14 → 3224.58] every time these days and then which is like is great but then also the idea of compensator doesn't
[3224.58 → 3230.82] really make sense because they nerfed the heck out of SLI so like it's the yeah, but they have
[3230.82 → 3236.74] the pc for the one percent coming soon yeah that's true um i thought he was going to expand on that
[3239.14 → 3243.62] it's just a different concept it's its great i like the new concept it's just the original concept
[3243.62 → 3248.02] of compensator it doesn't really we were basically trying to show that it's really stupid to put four
[3248.02 → 3253.38] graphics cards in your system, and now it's like you can, but they won't really work hey look we were
[3253.38 → 3259.62] right i guess we could do it that way hi Nika on ESTAC huzzah gamers the amount of like is so damn
