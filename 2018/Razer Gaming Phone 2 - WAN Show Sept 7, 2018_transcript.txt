[0.00 --> 7.58]  I think we're good to go now. I'm seeing only green lights. OBS is telling me that it disconnected and reconnected and stuff, but I think we're good to go.
[7.66 --> 15.08]  Welcome to the WAN show. It's just me this week. All of LMG, as you might recall, I'm not technically part of LMG anymore.
[15.18 --> 28.58]  All of LMG is off on this workcation thing in Banff. If you want to look that up, a lot of us Canadians say Banff, which sounds like it has an M in it, but it's actually an N.
[28.58 --> 35.84]  So it's B-A-N-F-F. It's an absolutely beautiful place. A bunch of them are uploading pictures to their Instagrams and their Twitters and whatnot, so check that out.
[35.90 --> 40.52]  It's super cool, but again, it is just me this week, so this is the WAN show.
[40.88 --> 51.94]  We've got some topics, I guess, technically. There's a new AMD Zen and Radeon Vega CPU for just $55. Sounds super cool, but we'll talk about that later.
[51.94 --> 71.42]  Microsoft is going to continue support for Windows 7 if you pay them. There's a second Razer phone that has been confirmed, and there's some other cool news like leaked benchmarks showing off 9700K, some Steam news, some AT&T news, some EA news, a follow-up of the Jacksonville shooting.
[71.78 --> 78.48]  Tons of random stuff. So yeah, stay tuned. Intro. Boom. It worked. What up?
[78.48 --> 83.42]  Camera slightly out of focus. RIP! Don't think I can fix it!
[85.92 --> 89.42]  I might just be leaning too much or something. I'll try to fix it on my own.
[97.42 --> 98.18]  Sponsor slides?
[100.12 --> 100.88]  Or not.
[100.88 --> 107.74]  What now, audience? You didn't see that coming. You try to guess everything. You're like, oh, the WAN show's going to be late again.
[107.92 --> 113.12]  And you're right. By like three minutes. But you didn't guess that, did you? No sponsor slides. What now?
[114.36 --> 114.98]  Let's go.
[115.20 --> 117.50]  Okay, first topic. Let's talk about AMD.
[118.04 --> 119.28]  And let's talk about Vega.
[119.62 --> 120.42]  And let's talk about Zen.
[120.48 --> 121.32]  And let's talk about Radeon.
[121.54 --> 124.80]  There's a new CPU, like I said earlier, for $55.
[124.80 --> 129.82]  Now, I do want to say, I'm going to jump into the AMD's website here for a second.
[131.04 --> 133.02]  I guess you guys are going to see Twitch chat on screen.
[133.76 --> 135.04]  Because I want to be able to see you.
[135.24 --> 135.86]  There you are!
[136.36 --> 136.96]  Oh boy!
[138.86 --> 140.00]  This isn't...
[140.00 --> 141.88]  A lot of people have been like, oh my god, yay!
[142.04 --> 144.60]  Someone finally cares about the low-end scene.
[144.66 --> 146.38]  And that's not necessarily true.
[147.68 --> 152.48]  Intel does have processors that are around the $50 range as well.
[152.48 --> 157.40]  And that are two core, four thread processors, like this one is.
[157.96 --> 163.50]  What I will say is that Vega on a CPU is pretty neato.
[163.82 --> 167.38]  And they're claiming that you should be able to do eSports games.
[169.52 --> 172.06]  That's becoming a little bit broader of a statement these days.
[172.10 --> 174.00]  So I'm not 100% sure how confident in that I am.
[174.04 --> 177.48]  But it says eSports game, high definition 720p.
[177.62 --> 179.18]  Which is actually not bad.
[179.18 --> 183.52]  Especially for someone who wants to just dip their toe into gaming.
[183.98 --> 188.18]  If you can do that without buying a graphics card, you can...
[188.92 --> 192.50]  Is it okay? Is everything fine?
[193.34 --> 194.62]  It looks like everything's fine.
[194.82 --> 196.72]  There's some people in the comments trying to troll me.
[196.88 --> 198.08]  But I'm just going to keep moving anyways.
[200.28 --> 205.96]  It's going to be nice to be able to play what I'm assuming is like Counter-Strike League of Legends kind of stuff.
[205.96 --> 211.00]  I don't think we're going to be hitting near the ranges of stuff like Overwatch.
[211.26 --> 214.94]  Which is very, very much in the eSports range these days.
[215.30 --> 220.46]  And then there's other companies that try to claim their like good positive eSports titles like PUBG.
[220.64 --> 221.38]  And that's just weird.
[221.52 --> 223.40]  And I don't know what eSports...
[223.40 --> 226.04]  The category of eSports games even necessarily means anymore.
[226.30 --> 231.10]  Before it was like StarCraft II, League of Legends, Counter-Strike.
[231.10 --> 234.64]  And some others that were around the similar difficulty to run.
[235.76 --> 238.14]  And now it's changed a little bit.
[238.20 --> 240.30]  Let me know what you guys think in the Twitch chat.
[240.36 --> 241.68]  Which I'm going to be watching all stream.
[241.78 --> 243.90]  Because I don't exactly have anyone else to host with me.
[244.28 --> 249.94]  Let me know what you guys think is the hardest to run proper eSports title.
[249.94 --> 257.52]  And if you think it could run on this new AMD Zenon Radeon Vega CPU for $55.
[258.36 --> 260.04]  Because you could get a really, really cheap...
[260.04 --> 262.18]  I don't know if you guys watched the last season of Scrapyard Wars.
[262.32 --> 265.38]  That was an older AMD chip with graphics on it.
[265.40 --> 266.18]  But an A10.
[267.20 --> 269.38]  Couldn't really run Fortnite reasonably.
[270.30 --> 272.20]  But that wasn't at 720p.
[272.92 --> 274.62]  We were doing that I believe at 1080.
[275.18 --> 276.94]  So, I don't know.
[276.94 --> 281.30]  Microsoft continuing to support Windows 7 if you can pay.
[281.62 --> 286.56]  Although Windows 7 extended support is scheduled to go through January of 2020.
[286.98 --> 291.88]  This new paid for support I believe should go through 2023.
[292.72 --> 293.14]  Yeah, yeah.
[293.18 --> 293.60]  2023.
[293.86 --> 294.92]  We don't have a specific month.
[295.24 --> 298.34]  You will have to pay an additional fee for the security patches.
[298.44 --> 300.20]  And it will be just security patches.
[300.70 --> 303.14]  There's no details yet on pricing.
[303.28 --> 305.34]  This news comes from the register.
[305.34 --> 308.70]  By the way, that first topic was posted by The Benjamins.
[308.90 --> 310.74]  Thank you very much to The Benjamins on the forum.
[310.88 --> 314.78]  This one I don't think was posted by anyone in particular.
[315.34 --> 316.88]  Oh, there's actually a Kit Guru article.
[317.12 --> 318.32]  Let me jump over there real quick.
[325.90 --> 327.16]  Someone's saying Luke is feeling better.
[327.34 --> 327.66]  Nope.
[327.84 --> 328.52]  Still sick.
[328.62 --> 329.88]  Just putting it on for an hour.
[330.00 --> 330.42]  We're good.
[331.18 --> 331.92]  Here we go.
[332.24 --> 332.50]  Microsoft.
[332.50 --> 335.22]  Yeah, like I said, Microsoft adds another three years of security.
[335.44 --> 335.98]  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.
[336.18 --> 338.96]  This is going to be great for actually quite a few people.
[339.06 --> 344.32]  Because if I remember correctly, Windows 7 is about 40% of current operating system installs right now.
[344.44 --> 348.40]  I don't know if that's all operating systems on PCs.
[348.92 --> 350.02]  That's obviously not for phones.
[350.12 --> 352.96]  But I don't know if that's all operating systems for PCs.
[352.96 --> 355.54]  Or if that's all operating systems that are Windows.
[355.54 --> 358.44]  But it's about 40% of Windows installs.
[358.60 --> 360.24]  Which is a lot.
[360.92 --> 363.90]  I'm personally a Windows 8.1-er.
[364.22 --> 368.66]  I like Windows 8.1 even though my percentage of people is very, very, very small.
[369.12 --> 371.26]  I actually like that operating system.
[371.40 --> 373.62]  Because I can play all the games on it.
[374.02 --> 375.14]  Not most of them.
[375.38 --> 377.78]  Which I guess Linux now has.
[377.82 --> 378.54]  Which is quite cool.
[378.54 --> 381.48]  And I can do the vast majority of my work on it.
[381.58 --> 382.42]  Which is cool.
[384.26 --> 388.58]  But yeah, it's going to be interesting to see how much it costs.
[388.72 --> 391.36]  Because I don't know if this is going to be a...
[391.36 --> 393.58]  Someone's like, WTF Windows 8.1.
[393.84 --> 396.04]  Yeah, it's actually not that bad.
[396.12 --> 397.12]  People are saying it's terabat.
[397.24 --> 398.54]  I doubt you've used it.
[399.08 --> 401.24]  I doubt you've used it for an extended period of time.
[401.24 --> 403.40]  It has quite good compatibility.
[405.24 --> 407.52]  And it doesn't have the...
[407.52 --> 408.80]  Yeah, like it has quite good compatibility.
[408.80 --> 410.44]  Which is better than Windows 7.
[410.70 --> 412.56]  But then it's not Windows 10.
[412.88 --> 414.62]  Which is quite nice.
[415.08 --> 416.86]  You can all bicker about it.
[416.90 --> 419.34]  While you haven't used it for extended periods of time.
[419.78 --> 420.54]  That's fine.
[420.68 --> 422.86]  Anyways, Microsoft will continue support of Windows 7.
[422.98 --> 424.34]  Don't know if this is a consumer thing.
[424.48 --> 425.58]  Or a commercial thing.
[425.64 --> 428.90]  It might be vastly out of the price range of most consumers.
[428.90 --> 432.58]  And it might just be more for airports and enterprise stuff.
[432.72 --> 438.68]  Because we often find that those industries like to not upgrade their operating systems pretty much ever.
[439.26 --> 441.44]  And will often pay for extended support.
[441.56 --> 443.46]  So that might be the situation that we're having here.
[445.20 --> 447.24]  Because we've had that situation before.
[447.62 --> 450.62]  And they might just be prepping people beforehand that it will be possible.
[450.94 --> 455.92]  Because I think it was always an after the point kind of situation before.
[455.92 --> 462.66]  I bet you there will still be some groups, very major companies, that will have to go into another extended term after 2023.
[463.06 --> 465.92]  But we'll have to see when that happens.
[466.62 --> 466.98]  Wow.
[467.18 --> 468.68]  We are 10 minutes in.
[468.78 --> 470.58]  And I'm slamming through topics.
[470.82 --> 473.62]  That's one of the problems when you only have one host.
[473.72 --> 475.46]  There's no like back and forth conversation.
[475.60 --> 476.84]  So things just go real quick.
[477.42 --> 479.34]  I didn't really see...
[479.34 --> 480.48]  Chara's more focused than me.
[480.76 --> 481.48]  Can I do this then?
[481.66 --> 482.42]  Does that make it better?
[482.66 --> 484.26]  Are you going to stop crying now?
[484.36 --> 485.36]  That might fix it.
[485.36 --> 486.40]  Dennis, Dennis, Dennis.
[486.50 --> 487.72]  Dennis is off in Banff.
[487.78 --> 489.82]  I talked about this when I first launched the show.
[490.84 --> 494.02]  But I think I saw earlier today he was on a bike ride.
[494.50 --> 496.02]  I don't necessarily know what he's doing right now though.
[498.10 --> 502.14]  I just want to see in the comments if anyone mentioned any of those esports games I was talking about.
[502.52 --> 503.70]  I didn't really see any.
[504.04 --> 506.52]  Everyone just got so fixated on me using Windows 8.1.
[507.20 --> 508.82]  It's not the first time I've mentioned on the WAN show.
[510.54 --> 511.82]  Windows Vista is greater than all.
[512.00 --> 512.90]  Don't forget the sponsors.
[513.04 --> 514.98]  Today we do have two sponsors.
[515.36 --> 519.18]  But they're not your normal kind of sponsors.
[519.50 --> 520.72]  They're affiliate sponsors.
[521.30 --> 522.78]  And I don't have banners for them.
[523.06 --> 524.92]  So I had nothing to put up in the intro.
[525.32 --> 528.30]  And I will have nothing to put up when I talk about them later.
[529.76 --> 530.42]  But yeah.
[531.14 --> 531.46]  No, no, no.
[531.54 --> 533.50]  It's Humble Bundle and PIA, I believe.
[533.84 --> 535.56]  But we'll talk about them later.
[536.68 --> 537.08]  Okay.
[537.08 --> 538.22]  Next topic is...
[538.22 --> 540.62]  And this one confuses me a little bit.
[540.74 --> 542.44]  But let's talk about it.
[542.56 --> 544.86]  The second Razer phone has been confirmed.
[545.10 --> 545.64]  There was a...
[546.42 --> 547.24]  What is it called?
[547.52 --> 549.32]  Is it even in these notes?
[550.38 --> 550.94]  Yes.
[551.08 --> 555.32]  There was a financial report, which is often where we find these types of leaks,
[555.32 --> 561.96]  stating that Razer will be launching a Razer Phone 2 or whatever you end up calling it.
[561.96 --> 568.36]  They have been slashing prices on their first-gen phone, probably trying to get some of that inventory out.
[568.82 --> 571.72]  The phone should be relatively powerful.
[572.86 --> 575.36]  Like the first-gen phone, it will have 8 gigs of RAM.
[575.74 --> 578.76]  So the first Razer Phone had 8 gigs of RAM.
[578.76 --> 585.60]  The SoC, or System on a Chip, is getting an upgrade to the flagship Snapdragon 845 from Qualcomm.
[586.16 --> 589.90]  And it'll go from 4 cores to 8, which is actually pretty major.
[590.38 --> 597.84]  The phone appeared on Geekbench with a single score of 2026 and a multi-core score of 8234.
[598.12 --> 604.56]  Better than the first-gen model, but not as high as flagships such as the iPhone X and the Samsung S9.
[604.56 --> 612.36]  There may be more, apparently, there may be more gamer-centric features, such as a fast display,
[612.56 --> 617.02]  that may help to appeal to a more gamer-centric target audience.
[617.16 --> 621.00]  This is where my question for you guys lands.
[622.46 --> 632.84]  I know the gamer section as a whole, console and PC, are able to come together on the one idea that mobile gamers aren't gamers.
[634.56 --> 635.80]  But I have a legitimate question.
[636.62 --> 638.00]  And I need some help on this.
[639.52 --> 641.30]  Let's avoid the saltiness for a moment.
[642.00 --> 643.44]  I legitimately don't know.
[643.44 --> 647.32]  Is there any mobile games that will actually benefit from a 120Hz screen?
[650.02 --> 651.34]  I really don't know.
[653.62 --> 658.18]  Because the only mobile games that I've ever really even seen are like,
[658.18 --> 662.98]  either Pokemon Go, where you like swirl around and then just throw the thing,
[663.06 --> 665.22]  and then everything else happens kind of automatically,
[665.40 --> 667.72]  and you definitely don't need a 120Hz screen for that.
[668.06 --> 671.92]  Or it's like clicker simulators, where it's like,
[671.98 --> 675.98]  oh, you've waited 16 hours, press that button now,
[676.12 --> 678.54]  and then press that button, and then wait 16 hours again,
[678.64 --> 680.32]  or pay some money and have it accelerated.
[680.70 --> 682.42]  I don't know of Fortnite.
[683.30 --> 684.74]  Sort of forgot about that.
[684.74 --> 687.76]  Okay, so it's basically for Fortnite and PUBG.
[690.02 --> 691.28]  I guess that's pretty much it.
[691.88 --> 692.28]  VR.
[693.78 --> 694.20]  Okay.
[696.86 --> 699.20]  VR on mobile really sucks, but whatever.
[699.64 --> 700.70]  Okay, that's a good point.
[702.30 --> 707.66]  And 120Hz screens becoming common for mobile will help push VR forward.
[708.22 --> 709.92]  Someone's like, and Candy Crush!
[709.92 --> 713.50]  Oh my goodness.
[713.80 --> 719.54]  Okay, so it's probably mostly Fortnite, PUBG, and VR is a really small section.
[719.72 --> 721.06]  But sure, VR.
[723.04 --> 724.06]  People are saying prawn.
[724.20 --> 727.32]  I don't know if anyone's into 120Hz on that.
[727.50 --> 728.00]  It might be.
[728.42 --> 729.22]  I don't know.
[729.22 --> 731.52]  It does.
[731.62 --> 735.36]  That is a very technologically pushing sector of the market.
[735.54 --> 736.62]  That is absolutely true.
[736.76 --> 737.56]  That is a thing.
[738.42 --> 740.06]  Porn pushes the market like crazy.
[740.32 --> 745.70]  But I don't think there's a huge market for 120Hz phones just for that.
[745.92 --> 747.02]  I could be super wrong.
[747.24 --> 747.88]  I don't know.
[748.36 --> 749.32]  I'm just saying.
[750.26 --> 753.58]  Speaking of what I was just talking about,
[754.02 --> 757.70]  Steam is adding filters to hide certain games in search.
[757.70 --> 760.40]  You guys might have known a while ago, we talked on the WAN show,
[760.80 --> 762.60]  about Steam.
[763.00 --> 766.90]  They blocked some game, and then that started this huge conversation
[766.90 --> 770.46]  about what stuff should be or should not be allowed on Steam.
[770.86 --> 775.28]  And I think that pushed Steam to eventually say that they would pretty much allow
[775.28 --> 777.12]  everything that wasn't illegal.
[777.58 --> 779.98]  I think that was their official ending statement.
[779.98 --> 783.48]  But they would not be obligated to promote such things.
[783.48 --> 788.26]  And I think they're going more in that direction by allowing people to have filters.
[788.38 --> 791.64]  And I'm assuming there's going to be some form of default filters that you would have
[791.64 --> 792.32]  to uncheck.
[792.92 --> 797.72]  This would allow controversial titles to be on the platform, such as adult games,
[797.90 --> 801.58]  but make it so they don't automatically get promoted to everybody.
[802.14 --> 805.86]  Users also have flexibility to hide things they don't want in general.
[805.86 --> 812.46]  So if you didn't want, like, racing games, you could use the same filter to filter out those games,
[812.52 --> 813.14]  which would be cool.
[813.86 --> 815.60]  I personally like racing games.
[815.64 --> 816.08]  I'm just saying.
[816.28 --> 817.48]  I'm just saying.
[818.00 --> 821.34]  Users now will be able to list 10 tags, up from three.
[821.50 --> 825.70]  Apparently, you're already able to do three, of things that they do not want to see.
[826.52 --> 831.22]  Gamers now have the choice of omitting certain developers and publishers specifically.
[831.22 --> 836.50]  So if you have, like, a boycott against a specific publisher, sorry, EA is not on Steam,
[836.82 --> 843.62]  you would be able to block them out completely, as well as excluding mature content, adults-only
[843.62 --> 844.62]  kind of games.
[844.84 --> 849.70]  The former will exclude games where the publisher hasn't told Steam exactly what that mature content
[849.70 --> 853.52]  is, because I guess there's categories for that too.
[853.98 --> 856.52]  But I'm assuming that's more for a search reason.
[857.26 --> 857.82]  I don't know.
[857.82 --> 862.32]  The idea is to balance keeping Steam an open platform where a lot of different people can
[862.32 --> 866.32]  use it and it doesn't feel weird and you can actually have your, like, Steam store up on
[866.32 --> 869.34]  your desktop without, like, worrying if your mom's going to be able to see it.
[869.82 --> 877.46]  But also be able to have all these games that people apparently want on Steam.
[878.98 --> 879.42]  Yeah.
[880.26 --> 882.00]  What do you guys think about this solution?
[882.12 --> 883.80]  I think it's a relatively good solution.
[884.12 --> 885.82]  I don't care about those kinds of games.
[885.82 --> 890.66]  So I'll just leave the filter on, I guess, so that those types of games are blocked.
[891.00 --> 893.98]  Literally just so that they don't clutter up the store.
[894.14 --> 897.66]  Because I actually do use the Steam store to, like, search for new games every once in a
[897.66 --> 897.74]  while.
[898.04 --> 902.50]  I'll filter through, try to find something that seems interesting, and then look for
[902.50 --> 903.30]  reviews online.
[903.46 --> 905.32]  So if I can remove certain things.
[905.38 --> 907.12]  I actually really like the publisher feature.
[907.42 --> 911.80]  Because there's certain game publishers, even if I have nothing against them, I just already
[911.80 --> 913.86]  know that I don't like their type of games.
[913.86 --> 917.98]  So if I can just block them out, that seems great.
[918.36 --> 920.32]  So far, Twitch chat seems to be agreeing with me.
[920.78 --> 923.50]  Someone said, okay, solution about as good as you could get.
[923.58 --> 924.82]  Yeah, I could see that.
[926.46 --> 927.34]  Country roads.
[927.72 --> 928.58]  I don't think.
[928.94 --> 933.66]  Imagine you could block country roads and that it just only blocked Fallout 76 and all the
[933.66 --> 933.98]  DLC.
[934.32 --> 937.40]  That would be pretty great.
[937.78 --> 939.20]  Moving on to the next topic.
[939.20 --> 943.44]  British Airways suffers a huge data breach, apparently.
[943.44 --> 949.32]  An unknown attacker carried out a sophisticated breach of British Airways security.
[949.52 --> 956.20]  The hacker exposed 380,000 transactions and compromised customers' financial information,
[956.46 --> 958.32]  though not their travel plans.
[958.52 --> 958.74]  Okay.
[958.74 --> 963.16]  I mean, that's still bad, but it's actually not as bad.
[963.60 --> 968.14]  Their CEO has promised to compensate anyone who suffers financial loss due to the hack.
[968.52 --> 972.52]  Customers affected have already been notified by British Airways.
[973.00 --> 976.02]  And British Airways even took out a newspaper ad apologizing.
[976.24 --> 976.42]  Okay.
[976.96 --> 981.86]  Funnily enough, British Airways was in talks with IBM to outsource their security briefly
[981.86 --> 985.00]  before the cyber attack, perhaps to cut costs.
[985.00 --> 986.00]  Oof.
[986.96 --> 991.80]  They seem to be responding to this in the best way they probably could, to be completely
[991.80 --> 992.24]  honest.
[992.42 --> 996.92]  Having the CEO just kind of automatically come out and say, hey, we're going to cover
[996.92 --> 999.28]  any of the costs that happen from this.
[999.38 --> 1006.54]  Having people's travel information not be leaked is huge because that would be a problem
[1006.54 --> 1008.28]  for a huge number of reasons.
[1008.64 --> 1011.30]  Taking a newspaper ad just to make sure everybody knows.
[1012.82 --> 1013.06]  Yeah.
[1013.28 --> 1013.86]  I don't know.
[1013.86 --> 1019.80]  I mean, it's not a great thing that it happened, but this day and age, like practically everyone
[1019.80 --> 1020.38]  gets hacked.
[1020.48 --> 1023.34]  You guys should check out haveibeenpwned.com.
[1024.00 --> 1025.84]  Let me see if I can go there right now.
[1028.22 --> 1031.68]  Have I been pwned.com.
[1033.76 --> 1034.16]  Yeah.
[1034.42 --> 1035.00]  There we go.
[1036.34 --> 1036.94]  Have I been pwned?
[1036.98 --> 1038.34]  You can't see it because my camera.
[1039.76 --> 1040.16]  There.
[1040.34 --> 1041.12]  Have I been pwned?
[1041.12 --> 1041.60]  Whoa.
[1043.24 --> 1044.20]  Really cool website.
[1044.56 --> 1047.18]  Covers a whole bunch of different data breaches.
[1047.18 --> 1050.52]  I don't think technically all of them, but like a huge amount.
[1050.60 --> 1055.14]  And it's interesting because you can see under down here, largest breaches.
[1055.14 --> 1058.06]  You can see all the largest MySpace accounts from back in the day.
[1058.14 --> 1058.54]  Heck yeah.
[1058.94 --> 1059.56]  Pwned accounts.
[1059.56 --> 1065.00]  5,371,913,625.
[1065.34 --> 1066.86]  This happens a lot.
[1067.38 --> 1069.04]  A lot of different websites.
[1069.04 --> 1073.98]  A lot of different companies get wrecked and end up leaking data.
[1074.18 --> 1075.04]  It's a thing that happens.
[1075.24 --> 1077.06]  You should be securing your own stuff.
[1077.06 --> 1080.76]  I'm going to promote using some form of password manager.
[1080.98 --> 1087.96]  And there is a range of different ways, a range of different services that you can use for password management.
[1087.96 --> 1099.62]  And you can go with like super hardcore, kind of really annoying to use, but incredibly secure options all the way up to still way more secure than what you're probably doing right now.
[1099.62 --> 1105.86]  Not necessarily because I'm sure this audience especially has quite a few people in it that are properly taking care of their passwords.
[1105.86 --> 1111.16]  But still probably better than what you're doing right now, like just a standard password manager.
[1111.16 --> 1120.60]  And then you can also look into other ways of securing that password manager with 2FA, with physical authentication, with a bunch of other types of things.
[1120.98 --> 1126.12]  And that will make it so that it's easier to have a different password for every single website and service you use.
[1126.20 --> 1128.68]  So that when you do, I'm going to say when, not if.
[1128.68 --> 1136.64]  When you do get pwned by a website's user accounts or whatever getting leaked, you don't have all of your accounts get wrecked.
[1136.78 --> 1138.82]  It's like just that singular one.
[1140.26 --> 1143.02]  I would highly, highly recommend doing so.
[1144.90 --> 1149.44]  Yeah, it will help you in these situations because it's more or less inevitable.
[1150.44 --> 1157.30]  Like there's a wild amount of services that have their information stolen.
[1157.30 --> 1159.30]  And it's going to happen eventually.
[1159.94 --> 1163.62]  And I would, honestly, there's even an ease of use argument.
[1163.90 --> 1169.44]  Once you get a password manager set up, it's not, you don't have to remember so many things anymore.
[1169.58 --> 1174.02]  You have to remember like your master password for that password manager.
[1174.20 --> 1180.96]  I would also recommend having your email not in that password manager and remembering that password as well.
[1181.06 --> 1183.48]  So you have like two passwords that you need to remember.
[1184.08 --> 1185.38]  And that's pretty much it.
[1185.90 --> 1186.82]  That's not bad.
[1187.86 --> 1189.56]  That's pretty simple.
[1190.68 --> 1194.06]  Also, just for those master passwords, you can watch.
[1194.32 --> 1197.98]  There's a great XKCD on making a strong password.
[1198.18 --> 1204.06]  And we also have, I believe, a Linus Tech Tips episode and a TechWiki episode about making stronger passwords.
[1204.56 --> 1205.84]  So check those out.
[1206.32 --> 1209.40]  And secure your own stuff, man.
[1209.40 --> 1215.30]  Because while these companies should keep their things secure, it's still going to happen eventually.
[1215.84 --> 1217.92]  So don't trust anyone.
[1218.44 --> 1219.40]  Secure your own stuff.
[1220.86 --> 1221.62]  There you go.
[1221.62 --> 1225.00]  There's also leaked benchmarks of the i7-9700K.
[1225.00 --> 1231.00]  If we want to get back to tech topics, we have this from hexis.net.
[1231.42 --> 1234.36]  I haven't actually seen the chart load up on my screen yet.
[1234.88 --> 1235.88]  And there we go.
[1235.88 --> 1238.44]  I can tell you, definitely faster.
[1239.64 --> 1240.88]  There we go.
[1241.14 --> 1243.80]  Oh, this is like not the easiest to read thing ever.
[1243.80 --> 1246.78]  What is this?
[1247.22 --> 1248.56]  This should be the previous one.
[1250.02 --> 1251.92]  System manufacturer, system product name.
[1252.42 --> 1252.86]  Great.
[1252.86 --> 1253.86]  There.
[1255.54 --> 1256.92]  That's an 8700K.
[1257.66 --> 1260.12]  And then this should be a 9700K.
[1260.20 --> 1260.32]  Yeah.
[1260.58 --> 1265.42]  So we're looking at single core performance of the 8700K at 6,012.
[1265.64 --> 1269.66]  Single core performance of the 9700K at 6,297.
[1269.94 --> 1274.72]  Multi-core performance of the 8700K at 2,763.
[1274.88 --> 1279.26]  And multi-core performance of the 9700K at 30,152.
[1279.80 --> 1281.60]  So, I mean, it's a step up.
[1281.60 --> 1285.94]  Intel is still kind of ruling the single core performance realm.
[1286.50 --> 1289.70]  But DX12, Vulkan being a big deal.
[1292.36 --> 1293.58]  I'm just going to switch back here.
[1293.72 --> 1295.56]  DX12 and Vulkan being a really big deal.
[1296.00 --> 1300.14]  And processors generally having a lot more threads these days.
[1300.20 --> 1301.12]  And cores for sure.
[1301.22 --> 1310.14]  But threads these days is going to slowly promote more multi-core utilization as we move forward.
[1310.14 --> 1315.48]  And actually make multi-core utilization better and more beneficial as we move forward.
[1315.60 --> 1322.02]  If you haven't watched my DX12, what the heck is DX12 and Vulkan video, I would highly recommend you do so in general.
[1322.10 --> 1324.56]  Just because it's one of my favorite videos.
[1324.56 --> 1331.02]  But it also covers how multi-core is used.
[1331.02 --> 1336.40]  There's certain things, even with DX12 and Vulkan, that are going to have to stay on core one.
[1336.74 --> 1339.46]  But DX12 and Vulkan help, or thread one or whatever.
[1339.80 --> 1344.90]  But DX12 and Vulkan help spread out the load in general onto other cores.
[1345.02 --> 1346.58]  And enable that to happen.
[1346.94 --> 1348.92]  So, it's good.
[1349.16 --> 1349.50]  It's good.
[1349.50 --> 1353.50]  Right now, Intel is still kind of winning the game in the single-core performance.
[1353.78 --> 1359.50]  But there's a lot of things going in AMD's favor right now.
[1359.70 --> 1362.18]  So, don't feel too bad if you're an AMD fan.
[1363.52 --> 1364.94]  Everything's kind of good for everybody right now.
[1365.02 --> 1367.22]  The CPU space is quite strong at the moment.
[1367.50 --> 1369.06]  It has been stronger in the past.
[1369.14 --> 1372.38]  But it's great that we at least have a very strong competitor these days.
[1373.22 --> 1377.18]  Also, AT&T offers first responders unlimited data.
[1377.30 --> 1378.20]  But there's a catch.
[1378.20 --> 1386.24]  I don't necessarily know why this is an article on the WAN show, to be completely honest.
[1386.44 --> 1394.78]  My only reason why I'm saying that is they're just doing the same annoying crap that basically every other ISP is doing.
[1395.66 --> 1399.12]  We've been hearing about this a fair amount lately.
[1399.38 --> 1403.90]  When there's a disaster, everyone gets on to connected resources.
[1403.90 --> 1408.74]  A lot of people are trying to – it's called FaceTime?
[1409.38 --> 1410.04]  I call?
[1410.42 --> 1410.88]  I don't know.
[1411.50 --> 1412.68]  I don't know Apple stuff.
[1412.84 --> 1415.22]  But video call other people on iPhones.
[1415.34 --> 1416.16]  I believe it's called FaceTime.
[1416.78 --> 1417.54]  I'm trolling.
[1417.64 --> 1418.10]  I know what it is.
[1419.10 --> 1430.60]  Or trying to Facebook call or do other various video calls on Android or wherever else because they're trying to talk to their friends and family because they don't know if they're going to get wrecked by whatever disaster.
[1430.60 --> 1435.40]  So AT&T is saying, hey, first responders can have unlimited data, but there's a catch.
[1435.48 --> 1437.06]  You're on the same backbone as everyone else.
[1437.20 --> 1438.82]  We're not going to prioritize your stuff.
[1438.96 --> 1440.18]  So you're still going to get throttled.
[1440.18 --> 1444.44]  So it doesn't really help ultimately.
[1445.84 --> 1446.94]  That's a huge problem.
[1447.26 --> 1450.22]  They need a different – they need a different back end.
[1450.32 --> 1451.86]  Apparently, they actually have one.
[1452.28 --> 1458.88]  If local police, fire, or EMS, emergency medical services department doesn't – so – sorry.
[1459.00 --> 1460.88]  No, I skipped my notes a little bit.
[1461.88 --> 1465.38]  Oh, it just jumps right into that.
[1465.46 --> 1467.24]  Anyways, there's something called FirstNet.
[1467.24 --> 1472.30]  The U.S. government contracted, I believe it was AT&T, to make FirstNet.
[1474.32 --> 1476.30]  And that is supposed to save them from this.
[1476.38 --> 1479.70]  I don't know if it's like way more expensive or something if you want to subscribe to it.
[1480.28 --> 1485.14]  But they are not theoretically subject to throttling on FirstNet.
[1485.14 --> 1496.90]  And that's exactly what happened with Verizon this like a few months ago, I think, or two months ago or something, where there was that fire department that got super throttled.
[1497.46 --> 1502.20]  They're saying, well, they weren't on FirstNet, which is supposedly the issue.
[1502.50 --> 1505.04]  But I guess this is kind of nice.
[1505.04 --> 1509.78]  The AT&T First Responders Unlimited Data Plan has 25% off.
[1511.18 --> 1512.94]  So that's cool.
[1513.82 --> 1520.38]  It doesn't save you if your data is being throttled and you're a first responder trying to get information back and forth during a disaster.
[1520.90 --> 1522.66]  But it saves you a couple bucks every month.
[1523.10 --> 1527.14]  So that's A-plus for effort, AT&T.
[1527.14 --> 1529.88]  Anyways, EA is being sued.
[1531.34 --> 1531.74]  Nope.
[1531.94 --> 1533.32]  We're going to talk about sponsors.
[1533.80 --> 1534.68]  Get rekt, everyone.
[1535.08 --> 1536.68]  The first sponsor is Private Internet Access.
[1537.00 --> 1538.32]  And I don't have a banner for this.
[1538.78 --> 1540.30]  But I kind of want to – can I do this?
[1540.92 --> 1541.32]  Yeah.
[1541.56 --> 1541.84]  Okay.
[1542.08 --> 1547.42]  I'm just going to remove the banner in its entirety so that everyone knows that this is not like a normal section of the show.
[1547.72 --> 1549.52]  This is the sponsor section of the show.
[1553.06 --> 1554.62]  Linus is going to join us real quick.
[1554.62 --> 1556.14]  That's not in focus at all, is it?
[1557.14 --> 1557.54]  Whatever.
[1557.78 --> 1559.00]  Linus is going to join us for a second.
[1559.98 --> 1561.16]  So Private Internet Access.
[1561.26 --> 1563.86]  Private Internet Access, as you guys know, is a VPN.
[1564.02 --> 1565.28]  We've talked about it a ton on the show.
[1565.38 --> 1566.86]  I'm sure you guys have heard about it in general.
[1567.20 --> 1570.86]  But we have a partnership with them in ways.
[1571.28 --> 1574.24]  I guess the business guys are going to hate me because I don't know the correct term for this.
[1574.36 --> 1574.70]  Affiliate?
[1575.08 --> 1576.12]  We have an affiliate with them.
[1576.96 --> 1578.68]  They have a great VPN.
[1579.40 --> 1585.54]  It works for tons of different stuff like Windows, Mac OS, Android, iOS, Linux, Google Chrome specifically.
[1585.54 --> 1589.60]  If you don't want to have it on your whole computer and you want the ease of use of it just activating in your browser.
[1590.06 --> 1592.62]  With support for several other platforms coming soon.
[1592.70 --> 1594.42]  So like practically freaking everything.
[1594.90 --> 1596.20]  And even more stuff later on.
[1596.46 --> 1602.84]  You can connect up to five devices at the same time under one plan with Private Internet Access.
[1602.84 --> 1604.78]  And it has an Internet kill switch.
[1604.90 --> 1607.60]  This part I think is quite important and is actually really cool.
[1607.88 --> 1610.14]  The Internet kill switch will block all traffic.
[1610.88 --> 1612.96]  Essentially temporarily cut off your Internet.
[1613.14 --> 1616.14]  If the VPN becomes disconnected unexpectedly.
[1616.80 --> 1620.48]  The reason for that is if you're currently using your Internet.
[1620.74 --> 1623.36]  And you are expecting to be protected by a VPN.
[1623.36 --> 1627.56]  And then the VPN turns off and you keep broadcasting.
[1627.74 --> 1628.90]  You just compromised everything.
[1629.18 --> 1630.18]  And it was completely useless.
[1630.50 --> 1631.94]  So that is actually very important.
[1632.12 --> 1634.58]  That is a very important feature that a lot of people overlook.
[1635.00 --> 1636.14]  Check it out today.
[1636.32 --> 1637.34]  The link is in the description.
[1637.56 --> 1638.22]  If you're on Twitch.
[1640.40 --> 1641.30]  Yeah, I don't know.
[1641.30 --> 1644.20]  If you want to type this in.
[1644.50 --> 1647.04]  It's privateinternetaccess.com

[1653.14 --> 1657.08]  which is the easiest URL I've ever heard.

[1659.36 --> 1660.16]  If I even can.
[1661.74 --> 1663.02]  Boop, boop, boop, boop.
[1663.48 --> 1664.26]  Nope, I can't.
[1664.32 --> 1664.84]  Get wrecked.
[1664.98 --> 1665.88]  So again,

[1670.40 --> 1671.46]  slash linus wan
[1671.46 --> 1672.50]  There you go.
[1672.58 --> 1673.18]  I'm sure that's
[1673.18 --> 1673.96]  I'm sure you got that.
[1674.06 --> 1674.56]  Next up,
[1674.90 --> 1675.66]  Humble Bundle.
[1676.10 --> 1678.50]  Have we advertised Humble Bundle before?
[1678.64 --> 1678.90]  I don't
[1678.90 --> 1680.02]  I think this is a first.
[1680.66 --> 1683.64]  I haven't used Humble Bundle in a little while
[1683.64 --> 1685.18]  but I think like probably
[1685.18 --> 1687.42]  probably like half my Steam library
[1687.42 --> 1688.58]  is from Humble Bundle.
[1688.74 --> 1690.26]  I've gotten a ton of stuff from them.
[1690.46 --> 1692.54]  And it's really cool because you can adjust sliders
[1692.54 --> 1693.62]  and give money to charity
[1693.62 --> 1695.02]  or give money to Humble Bundle
[1695.02 --> 1695.98]  or give money to the developers
[1695.98 --> 1697.42]  all this fun stuff.
[1697.84 --> 1699.14]  Save money on games
[1699.14 --> 1700.20]  and help support charity.
[1700.40 --> 1701.12]  With Humble Bundle.
[1701.40 --> 1702.52]  Check out their summer sale.
[1702.68 --> 1703.16]  That's cool.
[1703.34 --> 1705.34]  They've got great deals on games like Planet Coaster,
[1705.72 --> 1706.06]  Prey,
[1706.38 --> 1707.14]  Fallout 4,
[1707.44 --> 1708.24]  and more.
[1708.42 --> 1710.32]  They've also got Humble Monthly
[1710.32 --> 1713.54]  where you sign up to get a curated bundle of games
[1713.54 --> 1715.70]  sent to your inbox each month.
[1716.86 --> 1719.26]  This month you can sign up for $12
[1719.26 --> 1722.36]  and 10% off most games in their store.
[1722.68 --> 1724.02]  And you'll get Overwatch.
[1724.50 --> 1725.14]  What the heck?
[1725.56 --> 1725.90]  Okay.
[1725.90 --> 1728.50]  I was expecting it was going to be a whole bunch of tiny little indie games
[1728.50 --> 1730.74]  but you get Overwatch for $12
[1730.74 --> 1732.14]  if I'm reading this correctly.
[1732.48 --> 1734.22]  You sign up for their Humble Monthly.
[1734.60 --> 1736.66]  You get 10% off most games that are in their store
[1736.66 --> 1737.82]  and you get Overwatch.
[1738.76 --> 1739.16]  Cool.
[1740.00 --> 1742.64]  Check it out at our affiliate link in the video description.
[1743.06 --> 1743.40]  Again,
[1743.90 --> 1745.24]  don't got one for you live
[1745.24 --> 1746.08]  but on YouTube
[1746.08 --> 1747.22]  it will be down there.
[1747.22 --> 1748.12]  The
[1748.12 --> 1749.82]  the
[1749.82 --> 1750.98]  URLs
[1750.98 --> 1753.62]  the Humble Bundle URL in general is
[1753.62 --> 1758.46]  geni.us
[1758.46 --> 1759.60]  forward slash
[1759.60 --> 1760.70]  capital W
[1760.70 --> 1762.80]  lowercase c
[1762.80 --> 1763.44]  capital A
[1763.44 --> 1764.10]  capital X
[1764.10 --> 1764.78]  capital B
[1764.78 --> 1765.48]  6
[1765.48 --> 1767.54]  The Humble Monthly link
[1767.54 --> 1768.06]  is
[1768.06 --> 1769.64]  geni.us
[1769.64 --> 1770.42]  forward slash
[1770.42 --> 1771.34]  lowercase x
[1771.34 --> 1772.22]  uppercase u
[1772.22 --> 1773.34]  uppercase q
[1773.34 --> 1774.64]  lowercase m
[1774.64 --> 1776.10]  and uppercase l
[1776.10 --> 1778.06]  and I can't copy and paste that into Twitch chat
[1778.06 --> 1779.96]  and I don't have a lower banner for you.
[1780.12 --> 1780.80]  So good luck.
[1781.04 --> 1781.80]  I believe in you.
[1782.14 --> 1783.64]  I absolutely believe in you.
[1784.00 --> 1785.02]  You can make it.
[1785.20 --> 1785.68]  Put it in the chat.
[1785.74 --> 1786.14]  I can't.
[1786.18 --> 1787.08]  I'm not logged into Twitch.
[1787.20 --> 1787.68]  My bad.
[1787.82 --> 1788.48]  Going back up.
[1788.58 --> 1789.46]  I'm running away now.
[1791.24 --> 1791.64]  Okay.
[1791.90 --> 1792.44]  Leaked benchmark.
[1792.58 --> 1793.50]  No, I already did that one.
[1793.64 --> 1794.02]  18th.
[1794.02 --> 1794.80]  I already did that one.
[1794.90 --> 1795.84]  EA being sued
[1795.84 --> 1797.00]  by victim of
[1797.00 --> 1798.10]  Jacksonville Madden
[1798.10 --> 1798.76]  tournament
[1798.76 --> 1799.50]  shooting.
[1800.48 --> 1802.32]  I think we all probably saw this coming.
[1802.84 --> 1804.82]  I wonder what you guys do think about it
[1804.82 --> 1806.50]  and I want to hear from you in Twitch chat
[1806.50 --> 1807.60]  and on the comments on YouTube
[1807.60 --> 1808.84]  because I think this will be
[1808.84 --> 1811.06]  a relatively controversial topic.
[1811.18 --> 1813.08]  I'm going to more or less keep my opinions out of it
[1813.08 --> 1814.58]  but I'm interested what the community thinks.
[1815.48 --> 1815.88]  After,
[1816.14 --> 1818.52]  I'm sure you guys have heard about the Jacksonville shooting
[1818.52 --> 1819.46]  at the Madden tournament.
[1820.00 --> 1822.26]  I didn't know Madden had in-person tournaments
[1822.26 --> 1822.72]  but
[1822.72 --> 1823.92]  sad.
[1824.06 --> 1824.80]  Very sad regardless.
[1825.22 --> 1826.96]  After a shooting that left two dead
[1826.96 --> 1829.68]  at a Madden NFL tournament in Jacksonville, Florida
[1829.68 --> 1832.04]  the other week,
[1832.28 --> 1833.20]  some time ago,
[1833.20 --> 1836.06]  one survivor is being sued by EA
[1836.06 --> 1838.62]  the producer of the game.
[1839.22 --> 1840.66]  His theory of the case
[1840.66 --> 1841.10]  is that
[1841.10 --> 1841.94]  I should put this back
[1841.94 --> 1842.40]  group
[1842.40 --> 1843.58]  there we go
[1843.58 --> 1844.96]  is that EA
[1844.96 --> 1845.96]  who sponsored the tournament
[1845.96 --> 1849.56]  negligently did not pick a safe venue
[1849.56 --> 1851.54]  or provide adequate security.
[1851.82 --> 1854.38]  It's unclear how much the plaintiff is seeking
[1854.38 --> 1855.88]  in monetary damages
[1855.88 --> 1858.30]  and EA has already promised to donate
[1858.30 --> 1860.62]  $1 million to the victims.
[1860.62 --> 1864.36]  The lawsuit notes that the area around the venue
[1864.36 --> 1866.02]  has suffered from other shootings
[1866.02 --> 1868.46]  as well as stabbings in recent years
[1868.46 --> 1871.30]  but seeing as the shooter was a Madden player
[1871.30 --> 1872.70]  from out of town
[1872.70 --> 1874.80]  not from Jacksonville, Florida
[1874.80 --> 1877.14]  it will be interesting to see
[1877.14 --> 1880.08]  if that argument holds any water in court.
[1880.08 --> 1881.98]  The shopping mall and the restaurant
[1881.98 --> 1883.86]  where the shooting took place
[1883.86 --> 1885.36]  are also being named
[1885.36 --> 1887.68]  as defendants.
[1888.18 --> 1891.00]  It's a relatively broad case.
[1893.22 --> 1895.08]  It's going to be really interesting.
[1895.20 --> 1897.52]  Again, I don't really super want to go into it
[1897.52 --> 1898.96]  but it's going to be very interesting
[1898.96 --> 1900.82]  to see what the community thinks about this.
[1900.82 --> 1905.30]  I know there are a lot of different opinions
[1905.30 --> 1906.06]  on security
[1906.06 --> 1909.08]  especially these days
[1909.08 --> 1910.50]  and because it was a shooting
[1910.50 --> 1912.72]  it involved a firearm
[1912.72 --> 1914.32]  which means there's like
[1914.32 --> 1919.72]  even more aggressive opinions on that.
[1920.22 --> 1922.34]  So it's going to be interesting
[1922.34 --> 1924.00]  to see what you guys have to say.
[1924.14 --> 1925.36]  So yeah, comment in Twitch
[1925.36 --> 1926.98]  comment on YouTube
[1926.98 --> 1929.82]  try not to rip each other apart too much.
[1929.82 --> 1932.80]  just have a civil discussion
[1932.80 --> 1935.04]  about crazy things that suck.
[1935.46 --> 1936.02]  How about that?
[1936.24 --> 1936.50]  Whoop!
[1936.64 --> 1937.50]  Didn't mean to play that intro.
[1937.64 --> 1938.20]  Sorry about that.
[1938.56 --> 1940.30]  Let me go back to the doc
[1940.30 --> 1943.48]  and scroll through here for a second.
[1945.14 --> 1945.50]  Forza.
[1946.38 --> 1946.86]  Forza.
[1947.24 --> 1948.96]  That actually sounds kind of cool
[1948.96 --> 1951.64]  but I just combined Forza or Forza.
[1952.24 --> 1954.14]  Is it Forza or Forza?
[1954.66 --> 1955.26]  I hear both.
[1955.34 --> 1956.06]  I'm going to go with Forza.
[1956.42 --> 1958.90]  Forza Horizon 4 specs have been announced.
[1958.90 --> 1960.50]  It is a racing game.
[1960.58 --> 1961.84]  I know this is the second time
[1961.84 --> 1963.24]  I've mentioned racing games in this stream.
[1963.64 --> 1965.28]  Racing games are not generally
[1965.28 --> 1967.42]  as hard on your system
[1967.42 --> 1968.62]  as other games
[1968.62 --> 1969.22]  which is cool
[1969.22 --> 1970.16]  because you kind of want
[1970.16 --> 1971.18]  really high refresh rates
[1971.18 --> 1973.64]  and you want really, really, really
[1973.64 --> 1974.44]  cranked graphics
[1974.44 --> 1976.36]  because it can look absolutely beautiful.
[1976.50 --> 1977.72]  Some of the best looking games
[1977.72 --> 1979.36]  and really not crazy hard to run
[1979.36 --> 1979.96]  which is great.
[1980.48 --> 1982.12]  It has been anticipated for a while.
[1982.18 --> 1983.22]  A lot of people have been knowing
[1983.22 --> 1984.78]  that it's on the way
[1984.78 --> 1986.22]  but the recommended specs are out.
[1986.22 --> 1987.44]  Although for 1080p60
[1987.44 --> 1989.98]  Microsoft recommends a GTX
[1989.98 --> 1991.72]  if you're on the GTX side of the game
[1991.72 --> 1993.86]  you're looking at like a 970 or 1060 about
[1993.86 --> 1995.12]  or if you're on the other side
[1995.12 --> 1996.64]  you're looking at like a 290X
[1996.64 --> 1998.16]  or a 470
[1998.16 --> 2000.48]  which really isn't too bad.
[2001.16 --> 2002.04]  970s are like
[2002.04 --> 2005.34]  four years old now.
[2006.14 --> 2007.24]  Somewhere around there.
[2007.50 --> 2008.42]  It's been a little while.
[2008.42 --> 2012.76]  And 1060s are now not quite
[2012.76 --> 2014.80]  but soon to being replaced.
[2015.18 --> 2017.30]  We're assuming 2000 series graphics cards
[2017.30 --> 2018.50]  are going to have a 60 eventually.
[2019.06 --> 2020.68]  So it's kind of on the way.
[2020.80 --> 2022.62]  So the prices shouldn't be too bad
[2022.62 --> 2023.34]  for those cards.
[2023.64 --> 2024.98]  And that's 1080p60.
[2025.52 --> 2026.38]  It's 60 FPS
[2026.38 --> 2028.18]  which again, important for a racing game
[2028.18 --> 2028.68]  in my opinion.
[2029.20 --> 2031.42]  However, if you do have something as low
[2031.42 --> 2032.70]  as a GT740
[2032.70 --> 2035.44]  which you like probably shouldn't have
[2035.44 --> 2038.40]  because you should have bought just a retro card
[2038.40 --> 2039.30]  but that's on the line.
[2039.38 --> 2040.72]  You might get a good deal on one of those.
[2040.92 --> 2041.64]  If it's a 720
[2041.64 --> 2042.66]  you should definitely not buy it.
[2042.68 --> 2043.04]  But anyways,
[2043.34 --> 2045.30]  if you have something as low as a GT740
[2045.30 --> 2047.60]  you will be able to play the game at 720p.
[2047.74 --> 2049.02]  You'll be able to play the game.
[2049.12 --> 2051.18]  It won't be the best experience ever
[2051.18 --> 2052.54]  but you will be able to play the game.
[2052.92 --> 2054.02]  The requirements
[2054.02 --> 2057.26]  which is spelt as respirements in the doc
[2057.26 --> 2059.88]  the requirements are more or less the same as Horizon 3
[2059.88 --> 2061.46]  so this shouldn't be way too surprising.
[2061.88 --> 2063.24]  Despite the fact that there were
[2063.24 --> 2064.86]  some noticeable graphical improvements
[2064.86 --> 2066.54]  when the game was shown as E3
[2066.54 --> 2067.30]  although
[2067.30 --> 2071.14]  as we all probably know here
[2071.14 --> 2073.48]  that means more or less nothing.
[2073.96 --> 2076.08]  I don't necessarily know
[2076.08 --> 2077.48]  if Microsoft has been caught
[2077.48 --> 2079.96]  showing like way better footage at E3
[2079.96 --> 2081.24]  than their game comes out as
[2081.24 --> 2083.66]  but we've had that happen like a lot
[2083.66 --> 2084.56]  so
[2084.56 --> 2086.22]  yeah
[2086.22 --> 2089.12]  don't know how much I would read into that
[2089.12 --> 2091.48]  but it is a next generation of the game
[2091.48 --> 2092.70]  so I'm assuming it will look
[2092.70 --> 2094.20]  it will look a bit better.
[2094.86 --> 2096.08]  And it will be interesting to see
[2096.08 --> 2096.76]  if they have
[2096.76 --> 2098.40]  some of that new tech
[2098.40 --> 2099.22]  coming out.
[2099.42 --> 2100.16]  Like I wonder if
[2100.16 --> 2102.22]  if you do have
[2102.22 --> 2104.72]  one of the new 2000 series cards
[2104.72 --> 2106.08]  a racing game
[2106.08 --> 2107.22]  with ray tracing
[2107.22 --> 2108.62]  would look great.
[2108.80 --> 2109.70]  I'm just saying.
[2110.14 --> 2110.62]  That would be
[2110.62 --> 2111.76]  that would be quite fantastic.
[2111.76 --> 2116.94]  and this becomes
[2116.94 --> 2118.34]  immediately awkward
[2118.34 --> 2121.52]  because there's about 23 minutes left in the show
[2121.52 --> 2122.52]  and
[2122.52 --> 2126.32]  and I don't have any more topics.
[2126.70 --> 2127.88]  I have an idea though
[2127.88 --> 2130.58]  if you guys want to hang with me for a second.
[2130.58 --> 2136.08]  the Linus Tech Tips forum
[2136.08 --> 2138.20]  in the tech news section
[2138.20 --> 2140.62]  which is very very close to a million posts
[2140.62 --> 2142.50]  can probably save me
[2142.50 --> 2143.66]  once again.
[2143.92 --> 2144.36]  Right.
[2144.48 --> 2145.44]  I don't know why this was
[2145.44 --> 2147.68]  oh no I do know why this wasn't in the dock
[2147.68 --> 2148.88]  but this is actually totally okay.
[2149.54 --> 2151.36]  AMD 7 nanometer GPUs
[2151.36 --> 2153.08]  have been confirmed for 2018.
[2153.64 --> 2154.48]  I am going to put
[2154.48 --> 2155.14]  a little
[2155.14 --> 2156.64]  slight warning
[2156.64 --> 2157.30]  here
[2157.30 --> 2159.32]  is that the confirmation of these cards
[2159.32 --> 2160.72]  may not be
[2160.72 --> 2161.66]  for
[2161.66 --> 2162.62]  gamers
[2162.62 --> 2163.78]  necessarily.
[2164.06 --> 2165.20]  I kind of suspect
[2165.20 --> 2166.44]  at the very least
[2166.44 --> 2168.06]  the first wave of these things
[2168.06 --> 2169.42]  is going to be
[2169.42 --> 2170.60]  for the not
[2170.60 --> 2171.62]  gaming community.
[2171.96 --> 2172.78]  So don't get
[2172.78 --> 2173.62]  too hyped
[2173.62 --> 2174.28]  but
[2174.28 --> 2175.58]  any GPUs
[2175.58 --> 2177.12]  on the 7 nanometer process
[2177.12 --> 2178.02]  will mean that
[2178.02 --> 2178.58]  will eventually
[2178.58 --> 2179.46]  come to gamers
[2179.46 --> 2180.68]  so this is exciting
[2180.68 --> 2181.66]  kind of regardless
[2181.66 --> 2182.90]  in the end.
[2183.12 --> 2183.56]  So don't worry
[2183.56 --> 2184.14]  don't worry about it
[2184.14 --> 2185.12]  don't worry about it too much.
[2185.38 --> 2186.36]  People want float plane news?
[2186.68 --> 2187.92]  How about this?
[2188.04 --> 2188.80]  I'll do that next.
[2188.96 --> 2189.58]  And there is actually
[2189.58 --> 2190.68]  some interesting float plane news.
[2190.94 --> 2191.38]  Finally.
[2191.88 --> 2192.78]  It's been a little while.
[2194.78 --> 2195.24]  This
[2195.24 --> 2196.66]  might not be
[2196.66 --> 2197.68]  the best news
[2197.68 --> 2198.20]  for NVIDIA
[2198.20 --> 2199.40]  as you might guess.
[2200.52 --> 2201.30]  Amongst the
[2201.30 --> 2202.52]  2000 series hype
[2202.52 --> 2203.66]  once it died down
[2203.66 --> 2204.50]  a little bit
[2204.50 --> 2205.38]  not even that much
[2205.38 --> 2206.46]  just a little bit
[2206.46 --> 2207.70]  AMD dropped
[2207.70 --> 2208.82]  this little news nugget
[2208.82 --> 2209.90]  hoping to
[2209.90 --> 2210.90]  as far as I can tell
[2210.90 --> 2211.80]  grab a little bit
[2211.80 --> 2212.42]  of that hype
[2212.42 --> 2213.66]  and pull the conversation
[2213.66 --> 2214.40]  back to them
[2214.40 --> 2215.42]  which is a good idea.
[2215.42 --> 2216.78]  NVIDIA seems to be
[2216.78 --> 2217.66]  going in a direction
[2217.66 --> 2218.32]  of
[2218.32 --> 2220.94]  almost removing
[2220.94 --> 2222.18]  some of the tangibility
[2222.18 --> 2223.36]  of differences
[2223.36 --> 2224.32]  between cards
[2224.32 --> 2225.64]  by adding the
[2225.64 --> 2226.48]  AI cores
[2226.48 --> 2227.38]  and moving to things
[2227.38 --> 2227.76]  like
[2227.76 --> 2230.34]  ray tracing technologies
[2230.34 --> 2231.12]  and other things
[2231.12 --> 2231.58]  that RTX
[2231.58 --> 2232.06]  is going to be able
[2232.06 --> 2232.74]  to do in general
[2232.74 --> 2233.60]  like moving
[2233.60 --> 2234.40]  anti-aliasing
[2234.40 --> 2235.68]  in some games
[2235.68 --> 2236.26]  if they're done
[2236.26 --> 2236.88]  the right way
[2236.88 --> 2238.22]  to the AI cores
[2238.22 --> 2238.90]  to free up the
[2238.90 --> 2239.34]  CUDA cores
[2239.34 --> 2239.84]  for other things
[2239.84 --> 2240.64]  blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
[2240.64 --> 2241.98]  all this kind of stuff
[2241.98 --> 2243.94]  and AMD's going like
[2243.94 --> 2245.44]  even smaller process
[2245.44 --> 2246.16]  brah
[2246.16 --> 2247.36]  so it's going to be
[2247.36 --> 2248.04]  an interesting fight
[2248.04 --> 2249.08]  in the next couple years
[2249.08 --> 2250.74]  and with Intel
[2250.74 --> 2251.52]  talking about
[2251.52 --> 2253.00]  tossing their hat
[2253.00 --> 2253.76]  in the ring as well
[2253.76 --> 2255.04]  graphics is going to be
[2255.04 --> 2256.10]  it's going to be fun
[2256.10 --> 2256.68]  for a little while
[2256.68 --> 2258.46]  so that's exciting
[2258.46 --> 2259.06]  because
[2259.06 --> 2261.96]  honestly for quite a few years
[2261.96 --> 2262.50]  there graphics
[2262.50 --> 2263.14]  and CPU
[2263.14 --> 2263.96]  were just like
[2263.96 --> 2264.96]  kind of dead and boring
[2264.96 --> 2266.44]  and it was basically
[2266.44 --> 2267.68]  more or less
[2267.68 --> 2268.74]  one team on each side
[2268.74 --> 2269.74]  and now we're
[2269.74 --> 2270.80]  splitting back
[2270.80 --> 2271.30]  and it's
[2271.30 --> 2272.72]  it's been good
[2272.72 --> 2273.86]  so speaking of which
[2273.86 --> 2274.84]  Flowplane news
[2274.84 --> 2275.56]  I don't have a banner
[2275.56 --> 2275.90]  for this
[2275.90 --> 2276.40]  what if I just like
[2276.40 --> 2277.42]  sit on the blue side more
[2277.42 --> 2279.16]  I guess that doesn't
[2279.16 --> 2279.76]  really make any sense
[2279.76 --> 2280.86]  because that's the wrong blue
[2280.86 --> 2281.84]  that's closer to like
[2281.84 --> 2282.06]  an
[2282.06 --> 2283.74]  is that closer to
[2283.74 --> 2284.46]  an Intel blue
[2284.46 --> 2285.60]  maybe
[2285.60 --> 2286.66]  that's probably the reason
[2286.66 --> 2287.44]  why they did this
[2287.44 --> 2288.48]  blue and red
[2288.48 --> 2289.54]  we need a green
[2289.54 --> 2290.48]  um
[2290.48 --> 2292.06]  Flowplane blue
[2292.06 --> 2292.48]  is lighter
[2292.48 --> 2293.20]  but anyways
[2293.20 --> 2294.56]  Flowplane is getting
[2294.56 --> 2295.74]  a bunch of new stuff
[2295.74 --> 2296.78]  pretty soon
[2296.78 --> 2298.22]  I know
[2298.22 --> 2298.70]  I know
[2298.70 --> 2299.40]  most of you probably
[2299.40 --> 2299.96]  don't even care
[2299.96 --> 2301.64]  but it's interesting to me
[2301.64 --> 2302.28]  uh
[2302.28 --> 2303.46]  we have a new payment system
[2303.46 --> 2303.80]  coming
[2303.80 --> 2304.82]  the reason why we haven't
[2304.82 --> 2305.98]  been talking a ton
[2305.98 --> 2306.96]  about Flowplane lately
[2306.96 --> 2308.30]  is because we've wanted
[2308.30 --> 2309.08]  to get this new payment
[2309.08 --> 2309.62]  system out
[2309.62 --> 2310.50]  because the current
[2310.50 --> 2311.32]  payment system is kind
[2311.32 --> 2312.28]  of a drag to use
[2312.28 --> 2313.88]  and we're refactoring
[2313.88 --> 2314.82]  the entire thing
[2314.82 --> 2315.86]  um
[2315.86 --> 2316.70]  and that
[2316.70 --> 2317.98]  should be out
[2317.98 --> 2319.30]  next week
[2319.30 --> 2321.10]  I've been saying that
[2321.10 --> 2322.46]  for a month and a half
[2322.46 --> 2323.06]  but
[2323.06 --> 2324.42]  I believe it this time
[2324.42 --> 2325.24]  wholeheartedly
[2325.24 --> 2326.08]  I think it's going to
[2326.08 --> 2326.78]  be out next week
[2326.78 --> 2327.58]  so that's actually
[2327.58 --> 2328.22]  quite exciting
[2328.22 --> 2329.04]  because that should be
[2329.04 --> 2329.86]  good for everybody
[2329.86 --> 2330.38]  people who are
[2330.38 --> 2331.00]  currently subscribed
[2331.00 --> 2331.50]  people are going to
[2331.50 --> 2332.24]  subscribe in the future
[2332.24 --> 2332.84]  that should be good
[2332.84 --> 2333.46]  for everyone
[2333.46 --> 2334.28]  um
[2334.28 --> 2335.24]  and with that payment
[2335.24 --> 2335.94]  system coming out
[2335.94 --> 2337.06]  that will free
[2337.06 --> 2338.00]  AJ up
[2338.00 --> 2339.62]  to push a bunch of
[2339.62 --> 2340.44]  things into prod
[2340.44 --> 2341.34]  that have been ready
[2341.34 --> 2342.10]  for a while now
[2342.10 --> 2343.08]  but have not been
[2343.08 --> 2343.84]  the priority
[2343.84 --> 2345.70]  over getting payments
[2345.70 --> 2346.04]  working
[2346.04 --> 2346.64]  like
[2346.64 --> 2347.36]  Discord
[2347.36 --> 2348.58]  so you will be able
[2348.58 --> 2349.16]  to have your
[2349.16 --> 2349.84]  Flowplane account
[2349.84 --> 2351.50]  and get authenticated
[2351.50 --> 2352.54]  on the Linus Tech Tips
[2352.54 --> 2352.94]  Discord
[2352.94 --> 2353.86]  with your
[2353.86 --> 2354.18]  Flowplane
[2354.18 --> 2354.92]  again this is not
[2354.92 --> 2355.60]  a feature
[2355.60 --> 2356.44]  this is not a feature
[2356.44 --> 2356.78]  yet
[2356.78 --> 2357.66]  but it's coming
[2357.66 --> 2358.70]  it's
[2358.70 --> 2359.58]  the code is like
[2359.58 --> 2359.96]  done
[2359.96 --> 2360.74]  it's just not in
[2360.74 --> 2361.02]  prod
[2361.02 --> 2361.42]  okay
[2361.42 --> 2361.66]  just
[2361.66 --> 2364.10]  don't try to do
[2364.10 --> 2364.54]  this now
[2364.54 --> 2365.70]  you'll be able to
[2365.70 --> 2365.98]  link your
[2365.98 --> 2366.58]  Flowplane.com
[2366.58 --> 2366.90]  account
[2366.90 --> 2367.74]  to Discord
[2367.74 --> 2368.54]  get Discord
[2368.54 --> 2369.34]  access rights
[2369.34 --> 2370.50]  in the LTT Discord
[2370.50 --> 2372.16]  and anyone else's
[2372.16 --> 2372.92]  Discord that decides
[2372.92 --> 2373.50]  to do this
[2373.50 --> 2374.22]  meaning right now
[2374.22 --> 2374.94]  tech deals
[2374.94 --> 2375.66]  and Bitwit
[2375.66 --> 2376.44]  um
[2376.44 --> 2377.08]  and anyone else
[2377.08 --> 2377.50]  that joins the
[2377.50 --> 2377.80]  platform
[2377.80 --> 2378.50]  will be able to
[2378.50 --> 2379.86]  have their own
[2379.86 --> 2381.48]  Discord floatplane bot
[2381.48 --> 2382.26]  which can give
[2382.26 --> 2383.16]  access to people
[2383.16 --> 2384.66]  and be used
[2384.66 --> 2385.26]  as a notification
[2385.26 --> 2385.68]  system
[2385.68 --> 2386.82]  speaking of notifications
[2386.82 --> 2387.86]  native through the
[2387.86 --> 2388.64]  website notifications
[2388.64 --> 2389.90]  are finally coming
[2389.90 --> 2391.16]  so you will actually
[2391.16 --> 2391.66]  be able to get
[2391.66 --> 2392.16]  notified
[2392.16 --> 2393.18]  through mobile
[2393.18 --> 2394.20]  um
[2394.20 --> 2395.32]  and if you want
[2395.32 --> 2396.20]  if you sign up for it
[2396.20 --> 2397.40]  uh email alerts
[2397.40 --> 2398.32]  for new videos
[2398.32 --> 2398.94]  to people that
[2398.94 --> 2400.22]  you are subscribed to
[2400.22 --> 2401.72]  which is also great
[2401.72 --> 2402.74]  also
[2402.74 --> 2404.00]  the chat
[2404.00 --> 2404.82]  for streaming
[2404.82 --> 2406.58]  will be fixed
[2406.58 --> 2407.16]  so I don't know
[2407.16 --> 2407.62]  if you heard us
[2407.62 --> 2408.08]  talking about it
[2408.08 --> 2408.42]  but we're going
[2408.42 --> 2408.84]  to be streaming
[2408.84 --> 2409.54]  the WAN show
[2409.54 --> 2410.66]  through floatplane
[2410.66 --> 2411.84]  that's all done
[2411.84 --> 2412.30]  as well
[2412.30 --> 2413.00]  again it's not
[2413.00 --> 2413.44]  it's not in
[2413.44 --> 2414.30]  it's not in prod
[2414.30 --> 2415.76]  don't
[2415.76 --> 2416.90]  it's not yet
[2416.90 --> 2419.16]  but the code is done
[2419.16 --> 2419.80]  it just hasn't been
[2419.80 --> 2420.34]  pushed into prod
[2420.34 --> 2421.32]  uh so we'll be able
[2421.32 --> 2422.34]  to stream the WAN show
[2422.34 --> 2423.66]  uh and any other
[2423.66 --> 2424.88]  creators on floatplane
[2424.88 --> 2425.60]  will be able to stream
[2425.60 --> 2426.26]  through floatplane
[2426.26 --> 2427.04]  as well
[2427.04 --> 2429.80]  fun stuff
[2429.80 --> 2430.46]  there's also a bunch
[2430.46 --> 2430.90]  of front end
[2430.90 --> 2431.56]  improvements coming
[2431.56 --> 2432.56]  and some other
[2432.56 --> 2433.26]  great stuff
[2433.26 --> 2433.92]  that doesn't
[2433.92 --> 2434.72]  necessarily affect
[2434.72 --> 2435.48]  you guys all that
[2435.48 --> 2435.76]  much
[2435.76 --> 2436.68]  um but yeah
[2436.68 --> 2437.08]  there's gonna be
[2437.08 --> 2437.86]  really really cool
[2437.86 --> 2438.74]  things for floatplane
[2438.74 --> 2439.60]  in a little while
[2439.60 --> 2441.20]  um someone in chat
[2441.20 --> 2442.26]  says rando question
[2442.26 --> 2443.00]  but will you guys
[2443.00 --> 2444.10]  ever do a online
[2444.10 --> 2444.76]  scrapyard wars
[2444.76 --> 2445.88]  like ebay or amazon
[2445.88 --> 2447.24]  maybe with a rushed
[2447.24 --> 2448.66]  custom design segment
[2448.66 --> 2449.92]  I seriously doubt it
[2449.92 --> 2452.30]  um the most boring
[2452.30 --> 2453.56]  part of any
[2453.56 --> 2454.28]  scrapyard wars
[2454.28 --> 2455.46]  is when linus and I
[2455.46 --> 2456.06]  sit down
[2456.06 --> 2457.06]  and go okay
[2457.06 --> 2458.38]  the competition started
[2458.38 --> 2459.38]  I'm super excited
[2459.38 --> 2460.22]  I'm apt up
[2460.22 --> 2461.14]  time for me to
[2461.14 --> 2461.94]  sit here on my
[2461.94 --> 2462.34]  laptop
[2462.34 --> 2464.98]  and type away
[2464.98 --> 2466.66]  just tappity tappity
[2466.66 --> 2466.92]  tap
[2466.92 --> 2467.84]  and send a bunch
[2467.84 --> 2468.14]  of emails
[2468.14 --> 2468.74]  that is like
[2468.74 --> 2469.76]  definitely the most
[2469.76 --> 2470.32]  boring part
[2470.32 --> 2471.66]  of any scrapyard
[2471.66 --> 2472.14]  wars ever
[2472.14 --> 2473.66]  so we'll probably
[2473.66 --> 2474.52]  stay away from that
[2474.52 --> 2475.44]  um
[2475.44 --> 2476.24]  but
[2476.24 --> 2477.06]  you know
[2477.06 --> 2478.52]  it's coming
[2478.52 --> 2482.48]  so what I'm hearing
[2482.48 --> 2483.82]  is all these changes
[2483.82 --> 2484.48]  have been fully
[2484.48 --> 2484.88]  implemented
[2484.88 --> 2485.46]  and we need to
[2485.46 --> 2486.38]  no
[2486.38 --> 2488.76]  stop
[2488.76 --> 2490.06]  none of them
[2490.06 --> 2490.62]  are implemented
[2490.62 --> 2491.20]  just chill
[2491.20 --> 2491.66]  they're coming
[2491.66 --> 2491.84]  though
[2491.84 --> 2492.46]  they're on the way
[2492.46 --> 2493.06]  and I'm quite
[2493.06 --> 2493.90]  excited about that
[2493.90 --> 2494.94]  I had something
[2494.94 --> 2495.44]  else I was going
[2495.44 --> 2495.88]  to talk about
[2495.88 --> 2496.28]  but I don't
[2496.28 --> 2497.42]  remember now
[2497.42 --> 2498.10]  um
[2498.10 --> 2499.82]  I'm just going
[2499.82 --> 2500.18]  to move on
[2500.18 --> 2500.62]  to the next
[2500.62 --> 2501.58]  next topic
[2501.58 --> 2503.48]  that's the magic
[2503.48 --> 2504.14]  of video editing
[2504.14 --> 2505.22]  yeah video editing
[2505.22 --> 2507.14]  an entirely online
[2507.14 --> 2507.76]  contest
[2507.76 --> 2508.56]  doesn't really
[2508.56 --> 2509.38]  give you a lot
[2509.38 --> 2509.72]  to
[2509.72 --> 2510.96]  to edit
[2510.96 --> 2511.76]  if you know
[2511.76 --> 2512.12]  what I mean
[2512.12 --> 2512.70]  uh
[2512.70 --> 2513.20]  we we have
[2513.20 --> 2514.08]  some cool ideas
[2514.08 --> 2514.74]  for for
[2514.74 --> 2515.48]  scrapyard wars
[2515.48 --> 2516.14]  um
[2516.14 --> 2516.48]  actually
[2516.48 --> 2517.66]  Jay and I
[2517.66 --> 2518.66]  were talking
[2518.66 --> 2519.78]  at PAX West
[2519.78 --> 2521.56]  about a potential
[2521.56 --> 2522.32]  scrapyard wars
[2522.32 --> 2522.74]  idea
[2522.74 --> 2523.46]  um
[2523.46 --> 2524.04]  that we kind
[2524.04 --> 2524.28]  of
[2524.28 --> 2525.50]  started with
[2525.50 --> 2526.06]  little nugget
[2526.06 --> 2526.64]  and then grew
[2526.64 --> 2527.42]  it over time
[2527.42 --> 2527.74]  while we were
[2527.74 --> 2528.10]  sitting down
[2528.10 --> 2528.58]  having dinner
[2528.58 --> 2529.56]  um
[2529.56 --> 2530.22]  and
[2530.22 --> 2530.64]  it
[2530.64 --> 2531.00]  it
[2531.00 --> 2531.86]  it could be
[2531.86 --> 2532.42]  pretty cool
[2532.42 --> 2533.04]  could be
[2533.04 --> 2533.56]  pretty sweet
[2533.56 --> 2534.12]  I'm gonna pitch
[2534.12 --> 2534.60]  it to Linus
[2534.60 --> 2535.02]  when he comes
[2535.02 --> 2535.30]  back
[2535.30 --> 2536.50]  it's related
[2536.50 --> 2537.26]  to an idea
[2537.26 --> 2537.72]  that Linus
[2537.72 --> 2538.14]  and I came
[2538.14 --> 2538.70]  up with too
[2538.70 --> 2539.38]  but with
[2539.38 --> 2540.16]  Jay's input
[2540.16 --> 2540.74]  I think
[2540.74 --> 2541.18]  I think
[2541.18 --> 2541.60]  it made it
[2541.60 --> 2541.88]  even
[2541.88 --> 2542.70]  even better
[2542.70 --> 2543.72]  um
[2543.72 --> 2544.40]  someone just
[2544.40 --> 2545.10]  mentioned my
[2545.10 --> 2545.58]  stream
[2545.58 --> 2545.96]  and that
[2545.96 --> 2546.76]  reminded me
[2546.76 --> 2547.50]  of the thing
[2547.50 --> 2547.90]  that I wanted
[2547.90 --> 2548.58]  to bring up
[2548.58 --> 2549.14]  uh
[2549.14 --> 2549.82]  I do charity
[2549.82 --> 2550.22]  streams
[2550.22 --> 2550.84]  every once
[2550.84 --> 2551.54]  in a blue moon
[2551.54 --> 2552.24]  uh
[2552.24 --> 2552.80]  where I play
[2552.80 --> 2554.02]  games for 24
[2554.02 --> 2554.52]  hours
[2554.52 --> 2554.92]  because I'm
[2554.92 --> 2555.32]  insane
[2555.32 --> 2555.86]  and then people
[2555.86 --> 2556.44]  donate a ton
[2556.44 --> 2556.72]  of money
[2556.72 --> 2557.12]  and end up
[2557.12 --> 2557.44]  streaming
[2557.44 --> 2558.24]  for like 30
[2558.24 --> 2558.64]  hours
[2558.64 --> 2559.54]  but we make
[2559.54 --> 2559.96]  a whole bunch
[2559.96 --> 2560.24]  of money
[2560.24 --> 2561.64]  for extra
[2561.64 --> 2561.98]  life
[2561.98 --> 2562.50]  uh
[2562.50 --> 2562.90]  extra life
[2562.90 --> 2563.40]  which is
[2563.40 --> 2563.92]  uh
[2563.92 --> 2564.38]  children's
[2564.38 --> 2564.78]  miracle
[2564.78 --> 2565.16]  network
[2565.16 --> 2565.58]  children's
[2565.58 --> 2565.80]  miracle
[2565.80 --> 2566.42]  hospitals
[2566.42 --> 2567.10]  children's
[2567.10 --> 2567.50]  hospitals
[2567.50 --> 2567.90]  etc
[2567.90 --> 2568.94]  um
[2568.94 --> 2570.36]  I haven't
[2570.36 --> 2570.66]  done one
[2570.66 --> 2570.94]  in a long
[2570.94 --> 2571.24]  time
[2571.24 --> 2571.84]  because I've
[2571.84 --> 2572.28]  been super
[2572.28 --> 2572.98]  crazy busy
[2572.98 --> 2574.00]  with like
[2574.00 --> 2574.58]  float plane
[2574.58 --> 2575.38]  and other
[2575.38 --> 2575.74]  stuff
[2575.74 --> 2576.78]  and my
[2576.78 --> 2577.14]  life has
[2577.14 --> 2577.52]  been pretty
[2577.52 --> 2577.80]  hectic
[2577.80 --> 2578.36]  for a while
[2578.36 --> 2579.42]  but
[2579.42 --> 2580.60]  I'm gonna
[2580.60 --> 2580.96]  get back
[2580.96 --> 2581.36]  to it
[2581.36 --> 2581.94]  so
[2581.94 --> 2583.60]  October 6th
[2583.60 --> 2585.12]  October 6th
[2585.12 --> 2585.62]  I'm having
[2585.62 --> 2586.32]  my first
[2586.32 --> 2587.56]  charity stream
[2587.56 --> 2588.80]  of 2018
[2588.80 --> 2589.74]  I will be
[2589.74 --> 2590.44]  doing 24
[2590.44 --> 2591.02]  hours of
[2591.02 --> 2591.62]  playing games
[2591.62 --> 2592.22]  I will
[2592.22 --> 2592.92]  probably be
[2592.92 --> 2593.96]  doing my
[2593.96 --> 2595.00]  standard charity
[2595.00 --> 2595.76]  stream setup
[2595.76 --> 2596.62]  which is where
[2596.62 --> 2597.08]  I do
[2597.08 --> 2598.10]  um
[2598.10 --> 2599.62]  like one
[2599.62 --> 2600.16]  game from
[2600.16 --> 2600.74]  each year
[2600.74 --> 2601.46]  there might
[2601.46 --> 2601.92]  be some
[2601.92 --> 2602.72]  slight changes
[2602.72 --> 2603.16]  to that
[2603.16 --> 2603.50]  but I'm
[2603.50 --> 2603.80]  going to
[2603.80 --> 2604.82]  do one
[2604.82 --> 2605.28]  game for
[2605.28 --> 2605.66]  an hour
[2605.66 --> 2606.04]  and then
[2606.04 --> 2606.44]  switch which
[2606.44 --> 2606.84]  game I'm
[2606.84 --> 2607.18]  playing
[2607.18 --> 2608.08]  and probably
[2608.08 --> 2608.88]  it will be
[2608.88 --> 2609.36]  through the
[2609.36 --> 2609.64]  ages
[2609.64 --> 2610.20]  so I'll
[2610.20 --> 2610.56]  start in
[2610.56 --> 2611.30]  like 1990
[2611.30 --> 2612.52]  or maybe
[2612.52 --> 2613.36]  1992 at
[2613.36 --> 2613.72]  this point
[2613.72 --> 2613.92]  because I
[2613.92 --> 2614.30]  gotta kind
[2614.30 --> 2614.68]  of drag
[2614.68 --> 2615.06]  it forward
[2615.06 --> 2615.36]  to make
[2615.36 --> 2615.72]  it 24
[2615.72 --> 2616.06]  hours
[2616.06 --> 2617.04]  um
[2617.04 --> 2617.58]  but play
[2617.58 --> 2618.06]  one game
[2618.06 --> 2618.40]  for one
[2618.40 --> 2618.88]  hour from
[2618.88 --> 2619.42]  that year
[2619.42 --> 2620.02]  and then
[2620.02 --> 2620.52]  iterate the
[2620.52 --> 2620.88]  year by
[2620.88 --> 2621.20]  one
[2621.20 --> 2621.88]  year plus
[2621.88 --> 2622.14]  one
[2622.14 --> 2622.52]  whatever
[2622.52 --> 2623.54]  um
[2623.54 --> 2624.34]  and then
[2624.34 --> 2625.30]  play one
[2625.30 --> 2625.76]  game from
[2625.76 --> 2626.16]  that year
[2626.16 --> 2626.76]  and go
[2626.76 --> 2627.22]  so on
[2627.22 --> 2627.48]  and so
[2627.48 --> 2627.74]  forth
[2627.74 --> 2628.72]  um
[2628.72 --> 2629.48]  so yeah
[2629.48 --> 2629.88]  that's in
[2629.88 --> 2630.40]  about a
[2630.40 --> 2630.66]  month
[2630.66 --> 2630.96]  I would
[2630.96 --> 2631.30]  love to
[2631.30 --> 2631.60]  have you
[2631.60 --> 2631.90]  there
[2631.90 --> 2632.72]  even if
[2632.72 --> 2633.74]  you uh
[2633.74 --> 2634.50]  don't donate
[2634.50 --> 2635.32]  anything to
[2635.32 --> 2635.82]  extra life
[2635.82 --> 2636.24]  I'd love to
[2636.24 --> 2636.58]  have you there
[2636.58 --> 2636.96]  regardless
[2636.96 --> 2638.78]  and uh
[2638.78 --> 2639.46]  while most
[2639.46 --> 2640.02]  charities that I
[2640.02 --> 2640.34]  work with
[2640.34 --> 2640.88]  don't don't
[2640.88 --> 2641.30]  love this
[2641.30 --> 2641.78]  line I'm
[2641.78 --> 2642.24]  gonna say
[2642.24 --> 2643.34]  if you're a
[2643.34 --> 2643.82]  student who's
[2643.82 --> 2644.24]  just trying to
[2644.24 --> 2644.90]  scrape by or
[2644.90 --> 2645.16]  whatever
[2645.16 --> 2646.40]  don't donate
[2646.40 --> 2646.80]  anything
[2646.80 --> 2648.74]  don't worry
[2648.74 --> 2649.28]  about it
[2649.28 --> 2649.78]  don't worry
[2649.78 --> 2650.14]  about it
[2650.14 --> 2650.72]  take care of
[2650.72 --> 2651.22]  yourself for
[2651.22 --> 2651.98]  now and then
[2651.98 --> 2652.54]  once you're more
[2652.54 --> 2653.20]  established later
[2653.20 --> 2653.92]  on then
[2653.92 --> 2654.34]  come on
[2654.34 --> 2654.70]  and help
[2654.70 --> 2655.84]  I usually
[2655.84 --> 2656.42]  every year
[2656.42 --> 2657.04]  we do we
[2657.04 --> 2657.54]  do quite
[2657.54 --> 2658.18]  well my
[2658.18 --> 2659.36]  charity stream
[2659.36 --> 2659.84]  is apparently
[2659.84 --> 2660.50]  the biggest
[2660.50 --> 2662.38]  uh donator
[2662.38 --> 2663.86]  group for
[2663.86 --> 2664.50]  like British
[2664.50 --> 2665.74]  Columbia so
[2665.74 --> 2666.58]  we do pretty
[2666.58 --> 2667.36]  well with the
[2667.36 --> 2667.96]  charity streams
[2667.96 --> 2668.64]  don't worry
[2668.64 --> 2669.04]  about it too
[2669.04 --> 2670.30]  much um
[2670.30 --> 2671.46]  but yeah
[2671.46 --> 2672.04]  come on by
[2672.04 --> 2672.92]  October 6th
[2672.92 --> 2673.32]  there'll be more
[2673.32 --> 2673.94]  details later
[2673.94 --> 2674.36]  it will be
[2674.36 --> 2675.16]  probably starting
[2675.16 --> 2676.20]  uh Pacific
[2676.20 --> 2677.04]  Standard Time
[2677.04 --> 2678.78]  noon so
[2678.78 --> 2680.36]  yeah noon
[2680.36 --> 2681.22]  midday on
[2681.22 --> 2682.18]  October 6th
[2682.18 --> 2682.56]  that's in
[2682.56 --> 2683.10]  about a month
[2683.10 --> 2683.86]  spread the
[2683.86 --> 2684.70]  news spread
[2684.70 --> 2685.16]  the noise
[2685.16 --> 2686.02]  and uh
[2686.02 --> 2687.30]  yeah I'll be
[2687.30 --> 2687.76]  doing a little
[2687.76 --> 2688.80]  probably smaller
[2688.80 --> 2689.62]  announcements but
[2689.62 --> 2690.02]  I'll be doing
[2690.02 --> 2691.08]  honestly I'm
[2691.08 --> 2691.52]  mostly trying to
[2691.52 --> 2692.04]  burn time right
[2692.04 --> 2692.32]  now because I
[2692.32 --> 2692.72]  have no more
[2692.72 --> 2693.66]  topics uh but
[2693.66 --> 2694.00]  I'll be doing
[2694.00 --> 2694.52]  more announcements
[2694.52 --> 2695.20]  leading up to
[2695.20 --> 2695.66]  it so I'll try
[2695.66 --> 2696.28]  to remind you
[2696.28 --> 2697.24]  going forth
[2697.24 --> 2699.52]  forwards towards
[2699.52 --> 2700.84]  October 6th
[2700.84 --> 2702.18]  anyways um
[2702.18 --> 2703.78]  I'm gonna search
[2703.78 --> 2705.16]  for a new
[2705.16 --> 2706.06]  topic apparently
[2706.06 --> 2707.36]  I know nothing
[2707.36 --> 2707.78]  about this
[2707.78 --> 2708.62]  apparently EA
[2708.62 --> 2709.98]  backpedals on
[2709.98 --> 2711.16]  screwing over
[2711.16 --> 2712.10]  PC Battlefield
[2712.10 --> 2713.10]  5 Standard
[2713.10 --> 2714.66]  Edition customers
[2714.66 --> 2715.30]  this was posted
[2715.30 --> 2716.62]  by uh
[2716.62 --> 2717.54]  Aluminum Tech
[2717.54 --> 2718.66]  on the forum
[2718.66 --> 2721.42]  and I don't
[2721.42 --> 2722.18]  actually know
[2722.18 --> 2724.06]  what was so
[2724.06 --> 2724.82]  bad about it
[2724.82 --> 2728.04]  let's see
[2728.04 --> 2730.34]  the website
[2730.34 --> 2731.30]  originally showed
[2731.30 --> 2732.90]  this on PC
[2732.90 --> 2733.82]  whereas the
[2733.82 --> 2734.48]  Battle Royale
[2734.48 --> 2735.36]  mode was marked
[2735.36 --> 2736.36]  as included for
[2736.36 --> 2737.06]  both console
[2737.06 --> 2737.52]  versions
[2737.52 --> 2738.60]  so if you
[2738.60 --> 2739.40]  check out
[2739.40 --> 2740.62]  this screenshot
[2740.62 --> 2742.64]  you can see
[2742.64 --> 2743.24]  the check marks
[2743.24 --> 2743.64]  everywhere
[2743.64 --> 2744.52]  I'm assuming
[2744.52 --> 2745.28]  this far right
[2745.28 --> 2746.36]  column is PC
[2746.36 --> 2747.90]  um the screenshot
[2747.90 --> 2749.00]  could be a little
[2749.00 --> 2750.00]  better but it
[2750.00 --> 2750.64]  shows that
[2750.64 --> 2751.68]  online multiplayer
[2751.68 --> 2752.40]  Battle Royale
[2752.40 --> 2753.12]  online co-op
[2753.12 --> 2754.20]  and Tides of War
[2754.20 --> 2755.40]  are check marked
[2755.40 --> 2756.36]  everywhere and
[2756.36 --> 2756.90]  there's just a
[2756.90 --> 2758.06]  burr a bold
[2758.06 --> 2759.62]  a bold dash
[2759.62 --> 2760.28]  just right in the
[2760.28 --> 2760.88]  middle where I'm
[2760.88 --> 2761.62]  assuming the PC
[2761.62 --> 2762.22]  column is
[2762.22 --> 2763.84]  um so that's
[2763.84 --> 2764.78]  that's a little
[2764.78 --> 2765.96]  that's a little
[2765.96 --> 2766.56]  rough but
[2766.56 --> 2767.78]  like the thread
[2767.78 --> 2768.48]  says they've
[2768.48 --> 2769.16]  backpedaled on
[2769.16 --> 2770.20]  it I have not
[2770.20 --> 2770.94]  played Battlefield
[2770.94 --> 2772.14]  5 yet if you
[2772.14 --> 2772.48]  guys are
[2772.48 --> 2774.12]  interested uh I
[2774.12 --> 2775.78]  believe there is
[2775.78 --> 2776.74]  a open
[2776.74 --> 2778.48]  why is everyone
[2778.48 --> 2778.96]  saying Skype
[2778.96 --> 2779.60]  Dennis I can't
[2779.60 --> 2780.06]  Skype Dennis
[2780.06 --> 2780.80]  Dennis isn't like
[2780.80 --> 2781.52]  the mountains right
[2781.52 --> 2782.04]  now having a
[2782.04 --> 2782.98]  vacation I'm gonna
[2782.98 --> 2783.54]  I'm gonna leave
[2783.54 --> 2784.48]  him alone he
[2784.48 --> 2784.96]  probably doesn't
[2784.96 --> 2786.16]  even have network
[2786.16 --> 2787.06]  access right now
[2787.06 --> 2787.90]  and when you know
[2787.90 --> 2788.54]  what just just
[2788.54 --> 2789.86]  let let Dennis
[2789.86 --> 2790.48]  have his day
[2790.48 --> 2792.22]  off okay um
[2792.22 --> 2794.06]  anyways yeah so
[2794.06 --> 2795.22]  the the EA is
[2795.22 --> 2796.50]  backpedaling over
[2796.50 --> 2797.78]  Battlefield 5 PC
[2797.78 --> 2798.26]  standard edition
[2798.26 --> 2799.10]  customers I'm
[2799.10 --> 2800.14]  assuming that means
[2800.14 --> 2801.98]  that they will
[2801.98 --> 2804.22]  now have battle
[2804.22 --> 2805.18]  royale mode
[2805.18 --> 2807.60]  EA has updated
[2807.60 --> 2808.66]  the Battlefield 5
[2808.66 --> 2809.54]  pre-order page
[2809.54 --> 2810.74]  which now says
[2810.74 --> 2811.88]  that Firestorm
[2811.88 --> 2812.44]  which is I'm
[2812.44 --> 2813.02]  assuming the
[2813.02 --> 2813.70]  battle royale
[2813.70 --> 2814.64]  mode will be
[2814.64 --> 2815.08]  part of the
[2815.08 --> 2815.54]  standard edition
[2815.54 --> 2816.28]  on PC yeah
[2816.28 --> 2817.18]  perfect it's
[2817.18 --> 2817.90]  unclear if this
[2817.90 --> 2819.48]  change uh if
[2819.48 --> 2820.16]  this is a change
[2820.16 --> 2821.08]  in policy or
[2821.08 --> 2821.50]  the company
[2821.50 --> 2822.30]  fixed a mistake
[2822.30 --> 2822.86]  on its website
[2822.86 --> 2823.50]  yeah so it
[2823.50 --> 2823.82]  might have had
[2823.82 --> 2824.94]  the Dash on
[2824.94 --> 2827.62]  accident I uh
[2827.62 --> 2829.54]  I kind of doubt
[2829.54 --> 2831.40]  doubt that so
[2831.40 --> 2833.80]  by accident I
[2833.80 --> 2834.40]  should say it's
[2834.40 --> 2834.92]  technically more
[2834.92 --> 2835.76]  correct my bad
[2835.76 --> 2837.72]  but yeah EA doing
[2837.72 --> 2838.68]  dumb stuff and
[2838.68 --> 2839.06]  hurting their
[2839.06 --> 2839.80]  community is not
[2839.80 --> 2840.28]  even remotely
[2840.28 --> 2841.88]  surprising so I'm
[2841.88 --> 2842.54]  gonna go with that
[2842.54 --> 2844.80]  angle uh moving
[2844.80 --> 2846.50]  on I don't know
[2846.50 --> 2847.08]  if anyone cares
[2847.08 --> 2847.92]  about this so I'm
[2847.92 --> 2848.48]  just gonna say the
[2848.48 --> 2848.82]  title
[2848.82 --> 2851.36]  Apple's 999
[2851.36 --> 2853.82]  pound euro no
[2853.82 --> 2854.52]  pound British
[2854.52 --> 2855.60]  pound Apple's
[2855.60 --> 2856.70]  999 British
[2856.70 --> 2858.30]  pound iPhone X
[2858.30 --> 2859.60]  is enormously
[2859.60 --> 2861.56]  underpriced uh
[2861.56 --> 2862.64]  quoted by Warren
[2862.64 --> 2863.24]  Buffett I don't
[2863.24 --> 2863.60]  know if anyone
[2863.60 --> 2864.42]  cares we're just
[2864.42 --> 2865.02]  gonna move on
[2865.02 --> 2867.80]  uh Microsoft is
[2867.80 --> 2868.84]  reviving Xbox
[2868.84 --> 2870.32]  One voice control
[2870.32 --> 2871.38]  but they're doing
[2871.38 --> 2873.06]  it using Alexa and
[2873.06 --> 2874.18]  Cortana powered
[2874.18 --> 2876.30]  devices I also
[2876.30 --> 2877.06]  don't know if
[2877.06 --> 2877.72]  anyone cares about
[2877.72 --> 2878.42]  this so I'm not
[2878.42 --> 2879.34]  gonna dive into it
[2879.34 --> 2881.12]  way too hard but
[2881.12 --> 2883.16]  again you heard
[2883.16 --> 2883.74]  it in the title
[2883.74 --> 2884.60]  the reviving voice
[2884.60 --> 2885.46]  control using Alexa
[2885.46 --> 2886.30]  and Cortana powered
[2886.30 --> 2887.30]  devices I didn't
[2887.30 --> 2888.16]  know Cortana really
[2888.16 --> 2889.34]  had a bunch of
[2889.34 --> 2891.60]  devices other than
[2891.60 --> 2893.70]  PCs I don't know
[2893.70 --> 2894.96]  but you know that's
[2894.96 --> 2896.64]  fine do do do do
[2896.64 --> 2899.34]  do do right if you
[2899.34 --> 2899.90]  guys haven't heard
[2899.90 --> 2901.60]  about this uh it is
[2901.60 --> 2903.08]  included in yeah it's
[2903.08 --> 2905.00]  posted right here so
[2905.00 --> 2906.36]  gamers Nexus has been
[2906.36 --> 2908.82]  uh has been like
[2908.82 --> 2910.74]  very very noticed for
[2910.74 --> 2911.56]  a little while right
[2911.56 --> 2912.82]  now because of
[2912.82 --> 2916.82]  their they're like I
[2916.82 --> 2917.36]  don't know what to
[2917.36 --> 2918.16]  call it it's not a
[2918.16 --> 2919.70]  normal fight but
[2919.70 --> 2920.68]  they're like squabble
[2920.68 --> 2921.56]  with Tom's hardware
[2921.56 --> 2922.88]  it's interesting because
[2922.88 --> 2923.96]  gamers Nexus is being
[2923.96 --> 2925.04]  very critical of Tom's
[2925.04 --> 2926.42]  hardware but in a way
[2926.42 --> 2927.88]  that I can respect
[2927.88 --> 2929.42]  relatively deeply where
[2929.42 --> 2931.52]  they're almost being
[2931.52 --> 2932.20]  like what the heck
[2932.20 --> 2933.48]  guys this isn't you
[2933.48 --> 2934.78]  it feels like they're
[2934.78 --> 2935.74]  like addressing their
[2935.74 --> 2936.98]  like drunk friend and
[2936.98 --> 2937.58]  they're being like come
[2937.58 --> 2938.34]  on man you need to
[2938.34 --> 2939.32]  you need to smarten up
[2939.32 --> 2939.96]  you need to stop
[2939.96 --> 2940.84]  drinking so much blah
[2940.84 --> 2941.18]  blah blah blah blah
[2941.18 --> 2942.44]  because they're they
[2942.44 --> 2943.22]  seem to be doing it
[2943.22 --> 2944.42]  like out of love which
[2944.42 --> 2945.90]  is cool I I've always
[2945.90 --> 2947.52]  liked the uh the like
[2947.52 --> 2949.52]  tech review community
[2949.52 --> 2950.34]  because they've always
[2950.34 --> 2951.20]  been really cool and
[2951.20 --> 2952.00]  it's it's cool that we
[2952.00 --> 2953.58]  can even criticize each
[2953.58 --> 2955.62]  other in positive ways so
[2955.62 --> 2956.34]  I I don't know I'm
[2956.34 --> 2956.96]  gonna I'm gonna give
[2956.96 --> 2958.34]  them that shout out and
[2958.34 --> 2959.74]  I'm gonna switch to my
[2959.74 --> 2961.06]  screen for a second this
[2961.06 --> 2962.10]  post was posted by
[2962.10 --> 2963.82]  rascal on the forum
[2963.82 --> 2966.02]  but if you heard about
[2966.02 --> 2967.64]  the the little fight
[2967.64 --> 2968.32]  that was going on
[2968.32 --> 2969.44]  between Tom's and
[2969.44 --> 2970.60]  gamers Nexus there was
[2970.60 --> 2971.06]  a bunch of that
[2971.06 --> 2971.80]  happening on Twitter
[2971.80 --> 2973.28]  there was also a video
[2973.28 --> 2974.12]  produced by gamers
[2974.12 --> 2976.94]  Nexus it it was not
[2976.94 --> 2979.10]  received super well by
[2979.10 --> 2981.36]  Tom's but then Tom's
[2981.36 --> 2984.22]  isn't ran by Tom
[2984.22 --> 2986.80]  anymore and Tom
[2986.80 --> 2989.22]  responded which is
[2989.22 --> 2991.28]  pretty interesting he
[2991.28 --> 2992.40]  responded on Facebook
[2992.40 --> 2994.38]  and then gamers Nexus
[2994.38 --> 2996.06]  made a video response
[2996.06 --> 2997.92]  to that addressing the
[2997.92 --> 2999.26]  original response
[2999.26 --> 3000.44]  blah blah blah blah blah
[3000.44 --> 3003.02]  blah blah blah the whole
[3003.02 --> 3004.00]  thing's been very very
[3004.00 --> 3004.80]  weird I know we've
[3004.80 --> 3005.78]  talked about I believe
[3005.78 --> 3006.48]  we've talked about it
[3006.48 --> 3008.16]  before on WAN show so
[3008.16 --> 3010.08]  I'm not gonna re go over
[3010.08 --> 3011.60]  everything so I'm gonna
[3011.60 --> 3012.34]  chat said there's
[3012.34 --> 3014.04]  actually a Tom question
[3014.04 --> 3014.38]  mark
[3014.38 --> 3018.10]  where did it go there's
[3018.10 --> 3018.86]  actually a Tom thought it
[3018.86 --> 3019.40]  was just a marketing
[3019.40 --> 3020.86]  play no there is a Tom
[3020.86 --> 3022.66]  he hasn't worked for
[3022.66 --> 3024.32]  Tom's hardware in a
[3024.32 --> 3025.72]  while now but
[3025.72 --> 3026.94]  interestingly enough
[3026.94 --> 3029.92]  there was actually in
[3029.92 --> 3031.48]  his post he talks about
[3031.48 --> 3032.68]  potentially coming back
[3032.68 --> 3034.58]  which is which is
[3034.58 --> 3036.20]  interesting I suspect he
[3036.20 --> 3037.54]  wouldn't necessarily even
[3037.54 --> 3039.16]  be able to come back to
[3039.16 --> 3040.56]  to talk again there's
[3040.56 --> 3041.24]  actually two different
[3041.24 --> 3042.24]  Tom's websites which are
[3042.24 --> 3043.28]  two different entities I
[3043.28 --> 3044.66]  believe it's Tom's
[3044.66 --> 3045.88]  hardware and then
[3045.88 --> 3047.68]  Tom's hardware dot de
[3047.68 --> 3048.82]  or something I'm not
[3048.82 --> 3049.84]  super sorry I'm not
[3049.84 --> 3051.44]  100% up to speed on
[3051.44 --> 3052.74]  that but there's and he
[3052.74 --> 3053.88]  might be able to come
[3053.88 --> 3055.34]  back to like one of them
[3055.34 --> 3057.34]  or I don't I don't I
[3057.34 --> 3059.16]  don't know but it's a
[3059.16 --> 3060.42]  it's a developing story
[3060.42 --> 3061.56]  I find it quite
[3061.56 --> 3062.96]  interesting and gamers
[3062.96 --> 3064.04]  Nexus is on the the
[3064.04 --> 3065.00]  forefront of that so
[3065.00 --> 3066.16]  check out their articles
[3066.16 --> 3067.56]  and stuff because I was
[3067.56 --> 3068.54]  just at PAX and was
[3068.54 --> 3069.96]  unable to pay full
[3069.96 --> 3071.56]  attention to all of this
[3071.56 --> 3073.24]  all of this stuff even
[3073.24 --> 3074.36]  though it's it's quite
[3074.36 --> 3077.92]  interesting going back
[3077.92 --> 3079.82]  to the previous pages I
[3079.82 --> 3081.26]  don't see this in here
[3081.26 --> 3083.80]  but what's his name actor
[3083.80 --> 3087.20]  that plays Superman
[3087.20 --> 3091.98]  Henry Cavill has
[3091.98 --> 3094.56]  apparently been selected to
[3095.22 --> 3099.10]  to play as the I'm gonna
[3099.10 --> 3100.34]  get wrecked for this but
[3100.34 --> 3101.58]  the Witcher he's gonna
[3101.58 --> 3104.04]  play the Witcher let me
[3104.04 --> 3105.08]  find an actual article on
[3105.08 --> 3106.10]  this
[3106.10 --> 3110.98]  yeah Henry Cavill will
[3110.98 --> 3114.12]  star in Netflix's series
[3114.12 --> 3116.98]  the Witcher here we go
[3116.98 --> 3118.56]  boop
[3118.56 --> 3121.68]  best known as Superman
[3121.68 --> 3125.40]  he will play Geralt there
[3125.40 --> 3127.10]  we go that's the name I
[3127.10 --> 3129.60]  forgot I'm so sorry I
[3129.60 --> 3130.48]  couldn't remember his
[3130.48 --> 3131.40]  name everyone's gonna
[3131.40 --> 3132.18]  rip me apart because of
[3132.18 --> 3133.80]  that Roach yeah that'd be
[3133.80 --> 3134.74]  great if he played the
[3134.74 --> 3135.08]  horse
[3135.08 --> 3139.92]  I would okay I'm gonna I
[3139.92 --> 3140.88]  know no one cares but I'm
[3140.88 --> 3141.44]  gonna go on this slight
[3141.44 --> 3142.50]  tangent for a second it would
[3142.50 --> 3145.28]  actually be hilarious if it
[3145.28 --> 3147.10]  was a super serious TV show
[3147.10 --> 3149.16]  and there was like a proper
[3149.16 --> 3151.56]  actor playing Geralt and
[3151.56 --> 3153.34]  then there's just Henry Cavill
[3153.34 --> 3156.58]  as Roach the horse I don't
[3156.58 --> 3157.50]  know why but I would have
[3157.50 --> 3159.00]  absolutely loved that
[3159.00 --> 3162.82]  oh man he's very young for
[3162.82 --> 3164.66]  Geralt yeah I don't like
[3164.66 --> 3166.86]  obviously if you've watched
[3166.86 --> 3169.44]  shows in the last long time
[3169.44 --> 3171.02]  it's not that hard to make
[3171.02 --> 3172.48]  someone look believably a
[3172.48 --> 3173.50]  little bit older I think
[3173.50 --> 3175.66]  they'll be completely fine with
[3175.66 --> 3176.88]  that he doesn't look like
[3176.88 --> 3177.90]  Geralt I think you guys will
[3177.90 --> 3179.02]  be a little bit surprised I
[3179.02 --> 3181.56]  think it'll be okay TV and
[3181.56 --> 3183.12]  movies are quite wondrous these
[3183.12 --> 3184.32]  days I think I think it will
[3184.32 --> 3188.66]  probably be fine but yeah what
[3188.66 --> 3190.42]  was I gonna say what Tron to
[3190.42 --> 3192.14]  go watch Tron to and look at
[3192.14 --> 3193.36]  the age transformation that
[3193.36 --> 3194.26]  they do in there it's actually
[3194.26 --> 3196.42]  quite incredible I don't think
[3196.42 --> 3197.40]  the production quality is gonna
[3197.40 --> 3200.14]  be quite on Tron to levels but
[3200.14 --> 3202.14]  they should be able to do they
[3202.14 --> 3202.88]  should be able to do quite a
[3202.88 --> 3206.04]  good job but with that I think
[3206.04 --> 3208.12]  I'm gonna end it it's been like
[3208.12 --> 3210.50]  almost an hour and I think I'm
[3210.50 --> 3213.14]  kind of done scraping the the
[3213.14 --> 3214.38]  the the line of tech tips
[3214.38 --> 3216.10]  forum for news articles thank
[3216.10 --> 3217.30]  you guys for watching I know
[3217.30 --> 3218.96]  it wasn't quite as good as if I
[3218.96 --> 3221.26]  had a co-host here but I did my
[3221.26 --> 3222.94]  best tune in next week for more
[3222.94 --> 3225.92]  great tech news I wanted to make
[3225.92 --> 3227.24]  sure that I did this show for you
[3227.24 --> 3228.82]  guys just because I knew we we
[3228.82 --> 3230.02]  didn't we were almost not gonna
[3230.02 --> 3231.66]  have a WAN show this week and we
[3231.66 --> 3233.90]  didn't have tech wiki episodes this
[3233.90 --> 3236.46]  week so like both of the sources of
[3236.46 --> 3239.20]  news from Linus media group didn't
[3239.20 --> 3242.40]  make it to you guys so I thought
[3242.40 --> 3244.06]  I'd I thought I'd try to scramble
[3244.06 --> 3245.88]  together with John's help thank
[3245.88 --> 3247.38]  you very much John from Linus
[3247.38 --> 3248.54]  media group for writing the doc
