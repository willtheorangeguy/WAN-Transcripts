[0.00 → 4.54] And we're live on the new set again.
[5.70 → 8.62] This is like the third set in the last two months?
[8.78 → 9.00] Month?
[9.26 → 9.58] Two months?
[9.64 → 11.76] Are you counting the between two ferns kind of set?
[12.10 → 12.86] Yeah, definitely.
[13.28 → 14.12] So fourth?
[15.10 → 16.78] Okay, so we had the original set.
[17.00 → 17.20] Yeah.
[17.34 → 18.72] Then we had between two ferns.
[18.86 → 19.32] Temporary.
[19.54 → 22.34] We had between two ferns deluxe, but I don't think that necessarily counts.
[22.68 → 24.40] Because it was like between six ferns.
[25.48 → 28.36] And then we had like the're in a corner, and it's weird.
[28.58 → 29.66] And then now we're here.
[30.40 → 33.36] It was like the tech linked sideshow.
[33.50 → 33.78] Yeah.
[33.90 → 35.92] Like tech linked.
[36.14 → 37.94] Get out of here.
[38.34 → 39.20] Relegated to the corner.
[39.30 → 41.18] Now dedicated hex wall.
[41.34 → 41.60] Yeah.
[41.76 → 43.24] Red versus blue with an orange chair.
[43.42 → 44.16] This is the new set.
[44.16 → 45.96] The orange chair is a little clashing.
[46.50 → 48.86] The white and gray chair works pretty well.
[49.24 → 50.82] Maybe we'll try to swap that one out.
[50.88 → 51.26] Who knows?
[51.32 → 52.26] It'll probably never happen.
[52.34 → 52.86] Doesn't matter.
[52.98 → 53.80] This is the new set.
[54.08 → 56.10] Welcome to the new Na Wan She.
[56.60 → 56.92] She?
[57.04 → 57.86] Bizarre world.
[58.18 → 58.40] Yeah.
[59.04 → 59.44] It's weird.
[59.44 → 66.28] It's also very weird because we've had the Wan Show in the other corner of the office near where the workshop is.
[66.28 → 70.10] For the longest time.
[70.22 → 72.24] Not the entire time that we've been here.
[72.44 → 76.70] Because Wan Show was technically like in some weird spare room for a little while and all this kind of stuff.
[76.80 → 80.66] But for many years it's been in the same corner facing the exact same direction.
[81.00 → 87.28] And now we are like almost as far away as possible from that point at the complete other side of the office.
[87.28 → 88.32] It should be quieter over here.
[88.32 → 89.58] It should be a lot quieter.
[89.78 → 92.46] And I think the sound absorption stuff in general should be a lot better.
[93.98 → 94.90] We'll have to...
[94.90 → 96.30] I wonder what the Twitch chat is saying.
[96.74 → 97.76] Let's do a straw poll, actually.
[97.86 → 98.74] I'm going to set up a straw poll.
[99.50 → 101.72] Straw poll dot me.
[102.68 → 109.58] I want to ask people whether it's like thumbs up or thumbs down for this set versus the other set.
[109.76 → 110.06] All right.
[110.26 → 111.50] Do you prefer the old area?
[111.66 → 112.82] Do you like the new area?
[112.82 → 114.68] New set.
[115.40 → 115.88] Better.
[116.76 → 117.32] Worse.
[117.46 → 117.78] Worse.
[117.90 → 118.04] Wait.
[118.12 → 118.64] Third option.
[120.62 → 122.64] I-D-G-A-F.
[124.06 → 125.36] I don't care.
[127.44 → 128.00] F.
[128.86 → 129.20] Whoa.
[131.08 → 132.76] I don't care fatso.
[133.46 → 134.02] Hey.
[134.50 → 135.34] That's mean.
[136.44 → 137.60] I resent that.
[137.68 → 137.80] Okay.
[137.84 → 138.40] What the heck?
[139.04 → 139.72] What just happened?
[141.10 → 141.76] I'm going to refresh.
[141.90 → 142.46] What is that?
[142.46 → 143.08] There we go.
[144.40 → 144.94] All right.
[145.28 → 147.04] I want to see what Twitch chat has to say.
[150.88 → 151.48] There we go.
[151.54 → 152.48] I missed the old set.
[152.68 → 153.68] I expected that.
[153.80 → 155.44] I expected a lot of people were going to bring that up.
[156.48 → 157.26] We fear change.
[158.48 → 158.80] Yeah.
[158.90 → 160.78] A lot of people do fear change in general.
[160.90 → 161.56] What do you think, Ed?
[162.12 → 162.70] New set?
[162.86 → 163.32] Old set?
[163.42 → 163.80] Which one?
[164.88 → 167.26] I'm working on throwing a light at you guys.
[168.18 → 169.46] Ed's trying to give us another light.
[169.46 → 170.90] I think it looks mostly okay.
[171.72 → 172.12] No.
[172.12 → 172.52] Background?
[172.84 → 173.06] Yeah.
[173.22 → 173.84] It's a little weird.
[173.94 → 174.92] Background's kind of...
[174.92 → 175.20] Yeah.
[175.88 → 176.12] Yeah.
[176.36 → 176.94] Get out of there.
[177.78 → 178.38] You're blocking us.
[178.38 → 178.98] Instead of lighting.
[179.24 → 179.48] Okay.
[179.92 → 180.48] Let's see.
[180.74 → 181.52] Way to go, Ed.
[181.58 → 183.22] It's like you work around cameras or something.
[183.22 → 184.92] Some people just aren't camera aware.
[185.96 → 186.56] You know?
[186.90 → 187.32] So...
[187.32 → 188.68] We got lots of sweet...
[188.68 → 188.96] Oh, wait.
[189.02 → 190.44] Are you still talking about straw poll?
[190.58 → 190.96] I am.
[191.00 → 191.24] Okay.
[191.42 → 192.04] Here we go.
[192.06 → 192.56] We got nothing.
[192.78 → 193.08] Never mind.
[193.26 → 193.60] We've made it.
[194.06 → 196.32] So, a lot of people don't care.
[197.88 → 201.84] Majority people, if they care, think it's worse.
[201.94 → 204.28] But that's not astounding because, again, people fear change.
[204.36 → 205.52] We're going to ask you next week again.
[205.54 → 206.44] We're going to ask you next week again.
[206.48 → 207.74] We're going to maybe keep this poll going.
[208.06 → 211.06] Also, the lighting is, like, really not perfect yet.
[211.46 → 213.20] But we'll see how it goes.
[213.30 → 214.54] I'm interested in what people think.
[214.54 → 215.24] I think it should be darker.
[216.16 → 216.40] Oh.
[216.80 → 217.52] Just mood lighting.
[218.16 → 218.34] Yeah.
[218.38 → 219.02] Get some candles.
[219.54 → 219.82] Yeah.
[220.02 → 220.62] The flickering.
[220.84 → 223.26] Yeah, that Philips Hue tech candle.
[223.66 → 223.92] Okay.
[224.06 → 226.46] But now, on to the actual show.
[226.98 → 227.74] What do we have?
[227.88 → 228.74] Lots of sweet topics.
[228.90 → 229.48] Tons of topics.
[229.56 → 234.80] We finally found out for sure what happened in the unfortunate Uber accident from March
[234.80 → 235.88] where that woman was killed.
[236.24 → 236.42] Yeah.
[236.52 → 241.50] We also now know that Apple knew that the iPhone 6 would bend.
[241.50 → 244.34] They knew it was going to bend before it launched.
[244.90 → 245.76] Now we know that.
[246.24 → 247.00] That's sick.
[247.44 → 248.38] That is actually pretty interesting.
[248.76 → 254.54] Also, Nintendo bans all online access to Switch devices owned by hackers.
[254.74 → 256.60] This is on an account basis.
[256.72 → 257.70] We'll talk more about that later.
[258.14 → 263.74] And there has already been GDPR complaints made against Google and Facebook in the least
[263.74 → 264.96] surprising news ever.
[264.96 → 267.42] This is the deadline day for GDPR.
[267.50 → 271.70] So you should stop getting mass emails about it pretty soon here.
[272.22 → 274.10] I'm sure you've probably received a lot.
[274.52 → 276.98] By the way, we're updating our privacy policy.
[277.22 → 279.20] I didn't even know I subscribed to you.
[280.48 → 280.80] Unsubscribe.
[280.80 → 285.14] I did a thing with the forum, which is it going to annoy some people for sureties.
[285.32 → 289.36] But instead of emailing everyone, I mean, so the next time you go log in, it's just
[289.36 → 289.76] like, hey.
[290.08 → 291.90] I saw that, and it confused me at first.
[291.96 → 294.06] I was like, I typed the wrong thing in and I loaded again.
[294.12 → 295.26] I was like, I'm going to have to scroll down.
[295.44 → 297.10] See, my problem is I did the same thing.
[297.18 → 298.84] So I think a lot of people are going to be pretty confused.
[299.08 → 300.86] You got to scroll down and click the agree button.
[300.96 → 301.54] Sorry about that.
[301.60 → 302.06] Roll the intro.
[302.20 → 302.72] A little confusing.
[302.84 → 303.58] Let's press the button.
[303.72 → 304.16] Let's go.
[307.04 → 307.36] Really?
[307.36 → 309.82] Oh, yeah.
[311.24 → 313.10] It's a beautiful lagoon.
[313.24 → 313.76] Hold on.
[313.96 → 314.70] Never leave.
[315.10 → 315.60] Hold on.
[316.44 → 316.88] How do I?
[316.96 → 317.58] I can't just.
[321.78 → 322.18] Okay.
[323.18 → 323.94] What's wrong?
[328.18 → 329.32] Will that do something?
[329.58 → 330.06] Yes.
[330.60 → 331.04] Yeah.
[331.30 → 332.56] That will give you swamp butt.
[332.88 → 333.04] Yeah.
[334.80 → 335.38] I'm dead.
[336.42 → 337.06] Thanks, Ed.
[337.36 → 338.70] Killing me off in the intro.
[339.96 → 341.26] Maybe that's why I left.
[347.08 → 347.44] Yeah.
[350.24 → 351.16] Savage jerky.
[351.30 → 351.64] Savage.
[351.70 → 352.34] Just like Ed.
[353.42 → 354.32] Moss backpack.
[354.58 → 355.22] The black pack.
[355.44 → 355.72] Yeah.
[356.10 → 357.22] And then bloody gaming.
[357.22 → 358.12] Bloody gaming.
[358.48 → 359.00] Keyboard.
[360.82 → 361.90] And we're back.
[362.20 → 364.46] I'm happy that I fixed the intro.
[365.30 → 367.14] I wonder if that's the only time that it's been broken.
[367.14 → 368.62] And then came back to life.
[369.10 → 369.50] Eventually.
[370.94 → 372.82] A new intro for a new beginning.
[374.38 → 375.08] Speaking of.
[375.08 → 375.74] What is Ed doing?
[376.42 → 377.62] The reddening.
[378.02 → 379.64] He's messing with the light.
[379.76 → 380.00] Whatever.
[380.20 → 381.30] Keep it going, Eddie.
[381.30 → 383.54] Speaking of not new beginnings.
[383.74 → 385.36] Old, old, old happenings.
[385.46 → 386.16] What just happened?
[386.32 → 387.18] You may remember.
[387.92 → 388.78] What have you done?
[388.94 → 389.48] I don't know.
[389.48 → 390.86] Can I keep going here?
[390.86 → 391.20] I fixed it.
[391.26 → 391.98] Yeah, go for it.
[392.40 → 398.02] Travel back in time to September 2014 when the iPhone 6 came out.
[398.94 → 401.60] And Unbox Therapy was like, the biggest video of all time.
[401.72 → 402.10] Drop.
[403.08 → 403.48] Okay.
[403.98 → 404.22] I mean.
[405.24 → 405.60] Yes.
[405.78 → 405.92] Yeah.
[405.98 → 410.60] So there was a bunch of viral content of videos and pictures of people who were like,
[410.86 → 414.48] look at my nice new shiny iPhone all bent to the shape of my legs.
[414.58 → 415.80] My hipster jeans are so tight.
[415.92 → 419.02] And then all the iPhone haters like me were like, Helene.
[419.80 → 420.40] Nerds.
[420.40 → 420.50] And then.
[421.50 → 422.76] I've got an Android phone.
[422.78 → 424.66] They don't always design things good.
[424.80 → 425.44] It's a brick.
[425.66 → 426.34] It doesn't bend.
[426.34 → 431.18] And then Apple basically said like, this isn't a design flaw.
[432.82 → 434.32] It's designed good.
[434.72 → 437.14] It's just there's like some bad apples out there.
[437.84 → 439.40] You know, we make a million of these things.
[439.74 → 439.88] Get it.
[440.72 → 446.74] But now, information contained in internal Apple documents filed under seal in a class action
[446.74 → 452.94] lawsuit show that Apple knew that the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were susceptible to bending prior
[452.94 → 454.48] to the phone's launch.
[454.48 → 460.54] The company found in an internal investigation that the iPhone 6 is 3.3, repeating of course,
[460.90 → 464.02] times more likely to bend than the iPhone 5S.
[464.38 → 470.24] And not surprisingly, the 6 Plus is 7.2 times more likely to bend than the iPhone 5S.
[471.08 → 474.62] That's kind of a weird statistic because like the big one's more likely to bend than the
[474.62 → 475.04] small one.
[475.20 → 475.70] No kidding.
[476.02 → 476.46] Yeah.
[476.66 → 476.88] Yeah.
[476.96 → 478.06] I was going to say that makes sense.
[478.42 → 481.94] So then the phone launched and everyone found out they were bending and that was bad.
[481.94 → 488.58] And then in early 2016, many iPhone 6 and 6 Plus devices started to exhibit symptoms of
[488.58 → 490.18] what's called touch disease.
[490.70 → 495.72] So you would get like a flickering gray bar at the top of your screen or your screen would
[495.72 → 497.86] be working only intermittently or not at all.
[497.86 → 506.56] And then it was determined by various third party repair people that that was happening because
[506.56 → 514.42] the integrated circuit responsible for transiting the touches to code was getting lifted
[514.42 → 517.50] off of the board because your phone got bent.
[517.50 → 519.90] So then the chip would get lifted off a little bit.
[520.84 → 522.82] So then people started complaining about that.
[522.88 → 524.96] And Apple didn't say anything.
[525.06 → 526.02] They didn't confirm that.
[526.08 → 532.74] But they quietly started to put what they call underbill underneath the chip so that future
[532.74 → 535.14] phones that got shipped would actually be stronger.
[535.38 → 536.70] But they didn't say that to the public.
[537.64 → 542.66] They did not publicly acknowledge touch disease until November 2016, even though it was May of
[542.66 → 545.38] that year that they started fixing all the chips.
[546.64 → 550.94] And they only acknowledge it in November because there was like widespread news reports about
[550.94 → 551.34] the issue.
[552.42 → 557.80] And at that time, they said that they were going to start replacing touch disease phones for
[557.80 → 559.10] a mere $150.
[559.64 → 563.42] And that had previously been a $350 charge.
[563.42 → 569.84] And in its public announcement, when they said they were going to do all this, they didn't
[569.84 → 573.24] actually say that they changed that they started fixing them.
[574.00 → 575.40] Yeah, they didn't say that.
[575.52 → 575.68] Yeah.
[576.96 → 579.16] They just said they're going to replace the touch disease ones.
[579.34 → 579.64] Yeah.
[581.12 → 584.74] It's like, I can't say I'm surprised, but it is fascinating news.
[585.70 → 590.96] It's probably going to hurt some at least some amount of the Apple fanboyism.
[590.96 → 594.44] But the Apple fanboyism hasn't been doing very well over the last few years.
[594.44 → 595.06] Well, that's the thing.
[595.12 → 599.76] It's just another episode in a series of trust betrayals over the last while, whether that's
[599.76 → 605.44] iOS rollouts that had all these bugs, or whether it's, what else did they do?
[607.96 → 608.86] Naming schemes?
[611.70 → 612.54] Help me out here.
[612.62 → 617.80] The 10 came out, and while a lot of people do like it, there's a huge amount of issues
[617.80 → 618.28] with it.
[618.28 → 621.94] Taking away the headphone jack pissed a lot of people off.
[621.98 → 622.28] Big one.
[622.50 → 623.60] Including loyal fans.
[623.80 → 633.68] I know this is coming from a PC fan and an Android fan, but I feel like sentiment really
[633.68 → 634.94] isn't there lately.
[635.44 → 640.86] Back when I used to work in a computer store, you'd have the Mac people come in, and they
[640.86 → 641.74] were really hardcore.
[641.74 → 645.14] And I worked with people that were there that were Mac fans, and they were really hardcore.
[645.26 → 650.38] And it was kind of hard to debate, because it came down to both sides were giving logical
[650.38 → 650.72] arguments.
[650.90 → 655.58] It just was that one side put more weight on one thing, and the other side put more weight
[655.58 → 656.26] on a different thing.
[656.32 → 656.50] Sure.
[656.58 → 658.62] So that made it so they liked different things.
[658.72 → 659.46] It was fine.
[659.52 → 660.90] It was an interesting battle.
[660.90 → 668.02] Now it's kind of getting a little worse, because the stuff that they used to trash on, like
[668.02 → 672.06] PC stuff or Android stuff for, is starting to happen on their side as well.
[672.78 → 674.76] And then I think that Google's closing the gap.
[674.90 → 679.56] Now that we have a flagship device that kind of represents Android, being the Google Pixel,
[680.12 → 681.16] then it's kind of easier.
[681.50 → 683.98] Although, Apple's still ahead in that.
[683.98 → 686.48] And we're talking about phones here.
[686.90 → 689.82] Let's acknowledge, as a Windows user, Windows sucks.
[690.30 → 692.44] I'm like this close to switching to Mac.
[692.84 → 694.70] What version of Windows do you run?
[695.92 → 699.30] I don't think I have the Spring Creators update on my...
[699.30 → 699.46] But 10?
[699.86 → 700.22] Oh, yeah.
[700.64 → 702.12] That might be why.
[702.42 → 706.36] I shouldn't have to use 2004 software to get a good experience.
[706.38 → 706.60] I'm just saying.
[706.98 → 709.74] Like 2018 stuff should be the best stuff.
[709.74 → 718.90] If you can make it work without being a pirate, you can get the embedded systems Windows 10
[718.90 → 719.24] version.
[719.42 → 720.18] It's far better.
[720.74 → 725.10] Or I would recommend the same situation embedded systems, but you don't have to be a pirate
[725.10 → 725.60] to get it.
[726.02 → 727.08] Windows 8.1.
[727.94 → 728.86] It's just a lot better.
[729.58 → 729.72] Yeah.
[730.08 → 733.26] It's one of my favourite things is when you're like, hey, I want to disable Windows update.
[733.32 → 735.80] And they're like, or no.
[737.48 → 738.98] It's like, what?
[738.98 → 740.92] That's not how a computer is supposed to work.
[741.42 → 743.30] Anyway, I think we're probably good for that topic.
[743.56 → 745.22] No, there's more interesting things about it.
[745.44 → 751.32] So in a court filing in the class action case, Apple's lawyers wrote that it's rigorous and
[751.32 → 756.72] comprehensive reliability test data proved that enclosure bending and twisting cannot
[756.72 → 762.80] cause the touch disease issue unless the phone had already been repeatedly dropped on
[762.80 → 763.62] a hard surface.
[763.62 → 771.70] And I think that's so interesting because what it says to me is like, look, we made a design
[771.70 → 772.30] choice.
[774.30 → 779.88] But that choice, like sure, it might cause bending, but it's that choice is not going
[779.88 → 785.32] to brick your phone and cause this touch disease unless you already screwed up by dropping it
[785.32 → 785.64] a bunch.
[785.64 → 791.90] It harkens back to, I believe it was the iPhone 4 circa 2010 where you're holding it wrong.
[792.38 → 792.74] Is that what you're doing?
[792.76 → 793.38] Well, I don't know.
[793.60 → 797.90] It was, they couldn't get good call quality because there was a band of aluminum around
[797.90 → 798.50] the outside.
[798.66 → 799.56] So calls were dropping.
[799.56 → 803.06] And their official response was making phones is hard.
[803.50 → 807.88] We're perfect at it, but no one could make a phone that's perfect.
[808.26 → 810.24] So we're still the best.
[810.52 → 811.68] It's just phones are hard.
[811.68 → 818.24] So what they're doing, and they need to do this is they need to continue to promote this
[818.24 → 824.06] and propagate this like fiction that we all buy into where Apple has superior engineering.
[824.28 → 827.92] As soon as that myth erodes, then what do they have?
[827.92 → 828.20] Yeah.
[828.86 → 833.56] So I think this is very on brand for the lawyers to have this statement.
[833.78 → 834.32] That stance.
[834.42 → 834.62] Yeah.
[834.78 → 835.48] That makes sense.
[837.78 → 839.70] We're moving on to a hard topic now.
[843.48 → 847.02] It's something that's difficult to approach in general and people have talked about it.
[847.12 → 852.94] People have mentioned it in Twitch chat already asking why it wasn't like the first topic.
[853.08 → 856.98] It wasn't the first topic because I just didn't necessarily think we would lead with this.
[856.98 → 859.68] I wanted to bring something slightly more upbeat to the table.
[861.18 → 864.46] We have had this man on the WAN show in the past.
[864.52 → 867.98] He was one of our guests quite a long time ago when we used to bring a lot more guests on.
[868.56 → 872.28] But John TotalBiscuitBane has passed away.
[873.58 → 877.44] He has succumbed to a four-year battle with cancer.
[877.84 → 879.80] He's just 33 years old.
[879.80 → 886.66] In the notes, but I'm going to go off notes, is talking about how he contributed a lot to gaming as a whole.
[886.80 → 888.62] He was huge into the Star Craft II scene.
[889.42 → 892.70] His YouTube channel was pretty massive in terms of reviews.
[893.10 → 896.20] If you're in the PC gaming community, you probably know of him.
[896.30 → 898.04] You've probably seen one of his game reviews.
[898.14 → 898.92] Especially indie games.
[899.12 → 900.10] Especially indie games.
[900.20 → 902.96] That was very cool because I really liked indie games for a long time.
[903.94 → 907.60] Very few people in the audience might remember this, but I used to have indie game reviews from PAX.
[907.98 → 910.98] They got no views compared to the rest of our content, so I stopped.
[911.20 → 911.46] But still.
[913.20 → 916.16] His wife, Jenna, is still around.
[916.16 → 921.72] And has stated that she's going to continue the co-optional podcast as well as her own YouTube channel.
[921.94 → 925.90] So if you want more of that flavour of content, be sure to tune in.
[926.28 → 930.70] And unless you have something to say, I don't think I'm going to keep going.
[931.86 → 934.70] If you want, check him out.
[934.96 → 936.22] The YouTube channel is still there.
[936.28 → 936.92] His Twitter is still there.
[936.96 → 940.60] You can still watch all his old reviews of indie games if you want to check different things out.
[940.60 → 947.14] And if you did that, if you consume that content today, you'd still be supporting those who survived him.
[947.54 → 949.50] Like his wife, Jenna, for example.
[949.82 → 950.78] Check out her YouTube channel.
[950.90 → 952.36] Keep watching co-optional podcasts.
[952.54 → 953.40] Do all that kind of stuff.
[954.76 → 954.96] Yeah.
[955.06 → 955.78] Rest in peace, John.
[956.16 → 956.98] Rest in peace, John.
[958.08 → 959.14] And moving on.
[959.36 → 960.08] Because I don't want to.
[960.08 → 961.12] No possible segue.
[961.96 → 962.70] Literally not.
[962.70 → 964.30] There's no possible segue now.
[964.42 → 964.62] No.
[964.62 → 968.52] So here's a story that we reported on when it first broke in March.
[969.22 → 977.24] The accident that happened in Arizona with a self-driving Uber that, again, this is actually also kind of dark.
[977.70 → 981.52] It was the first pedestrian death in a self-driving car case.
[982.38 → 986.98] So there's been a report published by the National Transportation Safety Board.
[987.26 → 994.30] It has all the details of what happened, what parts of the car's systems failed, the human error, the software.
[994.30 → 996.10] All of it we know now, finally.
[997.98 → 1003.22] So there's really like a play-by-play in the report, which you'll be able to click through.
[1003.40 → 1005.76] It's source number three if you get access to the WAN doc.
[1005.88 → 1011.88] Or if you go to the article that Luke has on the screen, you'll be able to click through as well from the first paragraph.
[1012.04 → 1014.54] The WAN doc will be available on the forum after the show, by the way.
[1014.80 → 1018.38] And this was posted on the forum, by the way, by Spartaman64.
[1018.62 → 1019.04] Thank you.
[1019.04 → 1028.16] So for those of you who don't know, there was a self-driving Uber cruising down a, I believe it's, there are two lanes.
[1028.70 → 1029.64] It's at night.
[1029.72 → 1032.64] There's two left-turning lanes, and then there's a bike lane on the right.
[1033.08 → 1040.24] And basically it's nighttime, and a woman crosses the street, not at a crosswalk, which is pretty much irrelevant, walking her bicycle.
[1040.86 → 1044.94] And the car strikes the woman, and she eventually died because of her injuries.
[1044.94 → 1052.46] There's also dash cam footage that was released that shows what the car is heading towards, and also inside the car.
[1052.66 → 1058.96] And the view inside the car, you can see an Uber employee who's supposed to be responsible for taking over in tricky circumstances,
[1058.96 → 1065.90] who appears to be looking down possibly at a smartphone, and no one knew if this person was being negligent or what.
[1066.90 → 1068.18] But now we have more details.
[1068.18 → 1072.40] So this is just crazy.
[1072.58 → 1080.42] So apparently what happened was shortly after the story broke, we learned that there was a statement from the producers of the LIDAR systems
[1080.42 → 1085.08] that they believe that they had checked and that their systems had performed properly.
[1085.52 → 1087.78] And the report confirms that.
[1087.78 → 1093.80] So what happened was, as the vehicle approached, I believe her name was Elaine,
[1094.74 → 1097.54] at first the vehicle detected just an object.
[1097.96 → 1100.62] This is at six seconds away from collision.
[1101.06 → 1104.08] Then as it gets closer, it's decided, okay, that's a vehicle.
[1104.24 → 1105.70] And then finally, that's a bicycle.
[1106.68 → 1107.70] But here's the problem.
[1110.10 → 1112.36] Hold on.
[1112.36 → 1120.08] At 1.3 seconds before impact, the self-driving system determined that an emergency braking manoeuvre was needed to mitigate a collision.
[1121.10 → 1127.20] According to Uber, emergency braking manoeuvres are not enabled while the car is under computer control
[1127.20 → 1130.92] to reduce the potential for an erratic vehicle behaviour.
[1130.92 → 1133.54] So the car sees that, oh, this is going to be crazy.
[1134.52 → 1138.42] It's going to need some tricky steering for us to avoid this.
[1138.54 → 1139.60] I'm not allowed to do that.
[1139.66 → 1140.60] The driver has to do that.
[1140.60 → 1143.28] So I should probably notify the driver.
[1143.90 → 1146.28] There are no alerts set up.
[1146.90 → 1149.54] The system is not designed to alert the operator.
[1149.90 → 1151.18] Wait, it gets worse.
[1151.62 → 1154.38] So then you're thinking, okay, but if there's someone in the driver's seat...
[1154.38 → 1158.12] I was just going to say, this is still a problem because the car shouldn't have to alert the driver.
[1158.64 → 1159.92] They should be paying attention.
[1160.10 → 1162.20] Well, it still should alert the driver because you could be...
[1162.20 → 1163.36] Yes, but it shouldn't have to.
[1163.92 → 1164.62] It shouldn't have to.
[1164.76 → 1167.02] It should, like, okay, no, it should have to, sorry.
[1167.40 → 1170.34] But the problem should have still been solved.
[1170.60 → 1170.78] Right.
[1170.88 → 1175.16] So presumably the person sitting in the driver's seat, they're saying, they're thinking, oh, this looks weird.
[1175.20 → 1175.96] I should take over.
[1176.16 → 1176.32] Yeah.
[1176.32 → 1181.98] But you would still like to see, like, you might be thinking, is this a situation where the car is going to do it or not?
[1182.10 → 1183.76] It'd be nice if the car was like, bang, bang, bang.
[1183.88 → 1185.52] And then you're like, yeah, okay, I'm going to take over.
[1185.84 → 1196.40] But it gets worse because the driver is actually responsible for monitoring diagnostic messages that appear on an interface in the centre stack of the vehicle dash.
[1196.40 → 1196.84] Oh.
[1196.84 → 1199.22] And tagging events of interest for subsequent review.
[1199.40 → 1200.82] That's what she's looking at.
[1200.96 → 1201.40] Oh.
[1201.54 → 1203.18] She's looking down, not at her phone.
[1203.44 → 1205.56] I mean, this is as per her statement.
[1205.68 → 1208.40] She did have a personal and a business phone in the car.
[1208.40 → 1213.36] But she claims she was actually just looking at the interface that she is supposed to be looking at.
[1213.52 → 1213.62] Yeah.
[1213.62 → 1219.90] So now you've got a situation where Uber's paying drivers to sit in the car and look at it and not look at the road, basically.
[1220.56 → 1223.40] And then the car is not going to go ding, ding, ding, look up.
[1223.94 → 1228.82] And then it plows into a pedestrian causing that person's death.
[1229.40 → 1229.68] Jeez.
[1229.84 → 1232.74] Like, you should have seen that coming.
[1233.10 → 1234.86] That is silly design.
[1234.86 → 1235.44] That is silly.
[1235.44 → 1236.24] That's like negligent.
[1236.28 → 1237.32] That's a bad system.
[1237.32 → 1237.64] Yeah.
[1238.10 → 1244.78] Presumably, when the engineers are working on this system, you would pay most attention to this kind of case.
[1244.86 → 1245.80] This isn't like an edge case.
[1245.86 → 1248.44] This is the critical what could happen case.
[1248.54 → 1251.78] Your takeover driver is constantly not looking at the road.
[1252.02 → 1254.20] That can't work that way.
[1255.04 → 1260.06] You could even, like, you said something along the lines of, like, oh, they have to make note of different events and stuff like that.
[1260.06 → 1267.68] I feel like you could just have a log where you have some form of, like, controller that's on the steering wheel while you're like, this type of event just happened.
[1267.76 → 1268.68] This type of event just happened.
[1268.78 → 1271.14] Just constantly keep notes and then fill it out later.
[1272.08 → 1273.58] You have cameras and stuff.
[1273.68 → 1275.36] At the very least, it needs to go ding, ding, ding.
[1275.52 → 1276.70] Hey, stop looking down.
[1276.92 → 1277.10] Yeah.
[1278.22 → 1279.10] Just crazy.
[1279.10 → 1286.36] So now, after that accident happened, Uber suspended its self-driving testing in lots of different places.
[1287.64 → 1288.50] And HUD would work.
[1288.66 → 1288.86] Yeah.
[1288.94 → 1290.00] Someone just said a HUD would work.
[1290.06 → 1290.20] Yeah.
[1290.24 → 1292.28] You could have something on the freaking, yeah.
[1292.44 → 1295.24] I feel like the driver should definitely be able to be looking up.
[1295.36 → 1297.44] The fact that they have to look down is really stupid.
[1297.80 → 1306.88] There's got to be some, whether it's a simplified controller or it's one of those, like, dial things that are super popular in cars so that they can at least still be looking up and just have it post up onto the windshield.
[1306.88 → 1307.66] Sorry, continue.
[1309.72 → 1315.02] Just the upshot is that Uber has now pulled its self-driving program out of Arizona, laying off 300 people.
[1315.74 → 1328.24] And as far as I could tell, I think that all of its self-driving operations now are happening out of its advanced technology centre in Pittsburgh, like its own compound or campus, and no longer in test cities.
[1328.60 → 1328.88] Okay.
[1329.88 → 1331.18] So that's going to hurt.
[1331.98 → 1333.06] Yeah, probably.
[1333.06 → 1347.02] I think one of the biggest things that's going to hold back automated driving and automated almost anything is companies being careless with it and having stupid things like this happen.
[1347.02 → 1360.12] And I hope that the companies that aren't being careless with it, and this isn't me Elon Musk trumping, there's definitely more than one, keep pushing forward, I guess.
[1360.38 → 1366.58] Well, almost every high-profile company has had some kind of story about this, whether that's Tesla or Waymo.
[1366.82 → 1368.36] And there's been a bunch with Tesla, too.
[1368.72 → 1368.90] Yeah.
[1370.18 → 1374.48] It's a fine line, though, because they're all trying to push to be first to market.
[1374.48 → 1376.58] There's going to be a huge first-mover advantage.
[1376.90 → 1380.48] And there's something to consider that is, like, there will always be some amount of failure rate.
[1382.06 → 1387.10] And it's comparing that failure rate versus the failure rate of human drivers.
[1387.50 → 1389.12] And as long as we're beating that, then good.
[1389.24 → 1397.16] But, like, it needs to – every single time that it does happen, because it's an automated system, we can go in and look at what happened.
[1397.28 → 1399.40] With a human driver, it's much harder.
[1399.68 → 1399.86] Yeah.
[1399.96 → 1401.12] It's much, much, much harder.
[1401.12 → 1401.24] Sure.
[1401.50 → 1404.80] And you rarely have a camera looking in the vehicle at the driver, so you can't tell anyone.
[1404.80 → 1406.30] You can actually diagnose these problems.
[1406.64 → 1406.78] Yes.
[1407.36 → 1407.68] Ideally.
[1408.22 → 1408.74] Solve them.
[1409.22 → 1410.84] Every iteration should be improved.
[1410.96 → 1412.48] Or, yes, yes, exactly.
[1412.62 → 1416.64] So not necessarily even solve it, but, like, make it less likely to happen at the very least.
[1416.64 → 1418.02] And that's on a system level.
[1418.22 → 1418.36] Yeah.
[1418.38 → 1421.16] Like, if you get into an accident, you may never repeat that mistake again.
[1421.38 → 1422.68] But that doesn't affect how I drive.
[1422.70 → 1423.78] It doesn't improve humanity.
[1424.02 → 1424.18] Yeah.
[1424.36 → 1424.62] Right.
[1424.62 → 1427.76] But it's kind of like cars versus airplanes, you know?
[1427.80 → 1430.94] People feel unsafe on airplanes, even though they're much safer.
[1431.10 → 1432.10] But it's about control.
[1432.24 → 1433.44] You don't control the plane.
[1434.32 → 1434.80] That's fair.
[1435.02 → 1437.22] A lot of the time, though, like – okay.
[1437.30 → 1440.00] So I've always found – you brought up the cars versus airplanes thing.
[1440.80 → 1443.44] I've always found it interesting that everyone's like, oh, have a safe flight.
[1443.52 → 1444.14] Have a safe flight.
[1444.26 → 1445.06] Everyone seems so concerned.
[1445.06 → 1445.66] I'll try.
[1446.08 → 1450.32] But then, like, if you jump in, like, a taxi, or they send you away in an Uber or something,
[1450.42 → 1451.52] like, all right, get out of here.
[1452.40 → 1453.62] People say drive safe.
[1454.02 → 1455.20] Yeah, that's true.
[1455.30 → 1456.24] People do say drive safe.
[1456.48 → 1460.14] I just think it's like the like, have a safe flight thing is like a guaranteed.
[1460.84 → 1461.10] Yeah.
[1461.76 → 1462.16] I don't know.
[1462.16 → 1463.26] And what are you going to do about it?
[1463.42 → 1463.66] Yeah.
[1463.80 → 1464.16] What is it?
[1464.54 → 1465.56] I'll put my seatbelt on.
[1466.10 → 1466.36] Yeah.
[1466.84 → 1468.84] I will listen to that demonstration.
[1469.20 → 1469.50] Do you?
[1469.50 → 1471.92] I'll put that mask on before I put it on my kid.
[1472.30 → 1474.74] That's the extent of safe flight that I can guarantee you.
[1474.74 → 1476.76] Where's your flotation device?
[1477.02 → 1477.94] Oh, underneath my seat.
[1478.08 → 1478.54] Oh, there you go.
[1478.94 → 1479.22] Nice.
[1479.52 → 1481.32] Sometimes it is the seat cushion itself.
[1481.54 → 1483.26] I like when they have that little straw and they go.
[1484.34 → 1485.08] The little what's there?
[1485.10 → 1486.00] They pretend to blow in it.
[1486.04 → 1486.32] Oh, yeah.
[1487.94 → 1491.90] If it doesn't inflate itself, you can manually inflate your thing.
[1492.18 → 1493.94] Have you ever flown with Air France?
[1494.96 → 1495.36] No.
[1495.58 → 1496.44] They have a video.
[1496.44 → 1500.24] It's the pre-flight check thing plays as a video.
[1500.24 → 1504.80] And the video is like the people demonstrating are five Victoria Secrets models.
[1505.12 → 1506.74] And they're all being really cute and funny.
[1507.30 → 1511.02] And it's very effective at getting your attention.
[1512.00 → 1513.12] That's actually pretty funny.
[1513.82 → 1514.74] That's a...
[1514.74 → 1519.62] I mean, if it makes more people watch, like, you know, maybe it's not a bad thing.
[1519.84 → 1520.14] Who knows?
[1520.34 → 1521.02] It's so French.
[1521.02 → 1522.42] It's the French thing you've seen.
[1522.60 → 1523.06] That is a pretty French thing.
[1523.06 → 1523.74] Of course they did that.
[1523.88 → 1524.04] Yeah.
[1524.90 → 1526.68] Speaking of, of course they did that.
[1527.04 → 1528.82] I'm going to talk about Flow plane for a second.
[1529.66 → 1531.04] It's a wonderful platform.
[1531.28 → 1532.14] You should check it out.
[1532.40 → 1534.04] I heard that if you...
[1535.02 → 1540.22] If when you go to watch Flow plane, if you pop some popcorn and, like, dim the lights a little bit and stuff,
[1540.42 → 1542.86] that it will increase the viewership experience.
[1542.94 → 1544.76] So I would recommend doing that.
[1545.18 → 1548.04] The Linus Tech Tips channel on here has been going ham.
[1548.04 → 1554.04] So if you want to check it out, you've got Linus Tech Tips, Tech Quickie, and Tech Linked,
[1554.74 → 1561.66] all publishing, all under the same freaking channel, which I don't think was in the agreement when we first started this.
[1562.34 → 1566.14] So, but if you want to check them out, there are tons of videos.
[1566.70 → 1571.44] Also, there's Nitwit Ultra, who's uploading fantastic stuff, and Tech Deals,
[1571.52 → 1576.82] who uploaded by far the longest video that we've had on Full plane, which was, like, well over an hour.
[1576.82 → 1577.80] Did it stress the system?
[1577.80 → 1580.48] It stressed me a little bit, but everything was okay.
[1580.56 → 1581.38] Everything worked fine.
[1581.42 → 1581.90] It was great.
[1582.12 → 1585.64] We didn't even let us know it was coming, which was actually cool.
[1585.72 → 1586.12] Oh, yeah.
[1586.26 → 1590.44] Because I heard through another person, like, oh, wow, there's this super long video on the platform.
[1590.54 → 1591.82] And I was like, it worked.
[1591.88 → 1592.78] You don't say.
[1592.78 → 1593.30] That's cool.
[1595.26 → 1595.70] Yeah, exactly.
[1596.02 → 1597.94] Anxiety attacks, like, again, about control.
[1598.06 → 1600.14] It's in the past, but you still have to experience that.
[1601.84 → 1603.84] I'm happy that Transcom didn't work at all.
[1603.90 → 1605.54] But, yeah, anyway, Full plane's great.
[1605.54 → 1609.72] It's $3 per creator so far because everyone has decided to have the same price.
[1610.10 → 1611.66] You can check it out at Fullplane.com.
[1611.80 → 1613.58] You can watch videos.
[1613.76 → 1614.40] They look great.
[1614.46 → 1615.20] They sound great.
[1615.38 → 1617.94] The comment section is much less cancer than it is on YouTube.
[1618.46 → 1619.00] Things are good.
[1619.36 → 1620.80] So, yeah, check out Full plane.
[1620.80 → 1621.24] Full plane.
[1621.24 → 1625.56] And now, for the rest of the sponsor stuff, we've got Bloody Gaming.
[1626.44 → 1627.40] Can you say your thing?
[1629.56 → 1630.36] Bloody Gaming.
[1630.54 → 1630.92] There you go.
[1631.04 → 1632.18] See, I think that's actually pretty good.
[1632.52 → 1632.76] I'm like.
[1632.80 → 1633.58] Oh, pretty bad, though.
[1633.60 → 1635.32] It's like the worst person in England.
[1636.38 → 1637.54] Who sounds like that?
[1637.72 → 1639.34] I can't do accents at all.
[1639.36 → 1639.68] In it.
[1640.20 → 1640.58] In it.
[1640.58 → 1641.18] Riley's perfect.
[1641.36 → 1642.16] Riley's perfect at accents.
[1642.16 → 1642.72] That would make sense.
[1642.82 → 1643.84] I could see him being perfect.
[1643.92 → 1644.34] There we go.
[1644.38 → 1644.88] Here's my notes.
[1645.42 → 1653.54] Today, we're talking about the Bloody Gaming B975 keyboard, which isn't this one, despite
[1653.54 → 1654.66] this being a bloody keyboard.
[1654.82 → 1655.74] I don't have it here today.
[1656.12 → 1657.66] But, wait, no.
[1657.84 → 1660.04] This is the B945.
[1660.42 → 1660.82] There we go.
[1660.86 → 1662.76] Which has the I can't even show you because it's under my laptop.
[1663.32 → 1663.52] Wait.
[1663.66 → 1664.14] Yep, I can.
[1664.44 → 1666.08] The jumped is on the other side.
[1666.42 → 1669.78] So, like, this is where WAS is, and then this is the jumped.
[1669.84 → 1671.32] I think that's way better for gaming.
[1672.06 → 1674.70] It depends on, so, it's actually kind of interesting.
[1674.70 → 1679.72] Especially if you don't use the jumped that often for, like, transactional data stuff.
[1679.72 → 1680.06] Like retail or something?
[1680.12 → 1681.44] But you might want it for macros.
[1682.44 → 1682.64] Yeah.
[1682.64 → 1686.08] It's an interesting idea because you wouldn't normally have your hand on that side of the
[1686.08 → 1686.28] keyboard.
[1686.38 → 1690.52] But if you're doing, like, accounting and stuff, you would much more often be full keyboard.
[1691.18 → 1693.24] When you're gaming, you're very often just one hand.
[1693.34 → 1694.16] So, having macro keys are cool.
[1694.16 → 1697.08] Yeah, you just have all those, that much more real estate for your macros.
[1697.20 → 1700.66] And then you've also got this added benefit of having your mouse closer, more ergonomic,
[1700.90 → 1701.66] less shoulder strain.
[1701.90 → 1702.42] So, yeah.
[1702.54 → 1703.54] Shoulder strain is a big deal.
[1703.54 → 1707.74] It's like you're using a poker or, like, a 60% keyboard, but you're not.
[1707.96 → 1712.86] A lot of people will go with 10 keyless keyboards and then get a separate 10 key so they can put
[1712.86 → 1714.24] it on the other side of their mouse.
[1714.78 → 1719.48] So, that they can be squared up, shoulder, shoulder, down to mouse, everything's okay.
[1719.62 → 1721.56] And then go over for jumped.
[1721.56 → 1723.14] But this is really easy, too.
[1723.66 → 1723.88] Yeah.
[1723.94 → 1724.94] Just a different idea.
[1725.38 → 1731.48] But we're talking about the 975, which is standard full size for those that don't want to switch
[1731.48 → 1732.72] form factors like me.
[1733.12 → 1734.70] Double shot ABS keycaps.
[1735.20 → 1739.26] Less game front text kind of stuff and much more clean look.
[1739.26 → 1745.38] It includes a wrist rest with two colours, black and red, and still has a 25% off deal with
[1745.38 → 1746.72] promo code TECHNICS.
[1746.90 → 1750.64] Check it out on Amazon or in the links below if you are on YouTube.
[1751.42 → 1754.34] Then next up, we have the Moss Backpack.
[1755.08 → 1755.48] Backpack.
[1755.68 → 1756.18] The black...
[1756.18 → 1757.82] Oh, it is literally called the Backpack.
[1757.94 → 1758.60] Yeah, I wasn't joking.
[1758.72 → 1760.82] I thought you just were repeatedly making the same joke.
[1760.84 → 1762.14] You can't trust anything I say.
[1762.32 → 1763.08] That was fantastic.
[1763.10 → 1764.00] I joke too often.
[1764.48 → 1766.28] I was like, it is black.
[1766.44 → 1767.36] Yes, it is, in fact.
[1767.42 → 1768.12] Not on the inside.
[1768.94 → 1769.28] Yes.
[1769.38 → 1769.58] Okay.
[1769.64 → 1773.30] This is one of my favourite things about this backpack is that it's bright orange on the
[1773.30 → 1773.58] inside.
[1773.90 → 1775.40] I've had this with a couple bags.
[1776.34 → 1780.38] It's way more important than you might realize at the beginning because you can find anything.
[1780.38 → 1781.02] Immediately.
[1781.40 → 1782.88] There's a power cable in the bottom.
[1783.24 → 1783.94] It's right there.
[1784.10 → 1785.78] You can see it so easily.
[1785.90 → 1786.98] It's actually great.
[1787.16 → 1791.74] I love backpacks that have bright orange insides because almost nothing else is ever bright orange.
[1791.90 → 1794.00] So if you need to find anything, it's super easy.
[1794.08 → 1794.82] It's also reflective.
[1795.30 → 1796.90] So you notice how it like glows a little bit?
[1797.42 → 1798.02] Just, it helps.
[1798.14 → 1798.48] I don't know.
[1798.62 → 1798.98] I don't know.
[1799.10 → 1799.74] I like it a lot.
[1799.92 → 1800.56] Don't worry about it.
[1800.60 → 1801.62] I'm into backpacks.
[1801.74 → 1802.18] It's a thing.
[1802.52 → 1807.44] But speaking of that power cord, you have the ability to plug your backpack in.
[1807.58 → 1809.30] Where's the external access bit?
[1810.38 → 1810.98] Do-do-do.
[1812.50 → 1814.38] I know it has it because I watched their video.
[1815.28 → 1815.62] But I don't know.
[1815.62 → 1816.00] Here it is.
[1817.26 → 1821.70] So in the side of the backpack, you can pull out a power cable.
[1822.64 → 1823.30] There it is.
[1823.52 → 1828.14] This can plug directly into the wall through a side access port so you don't have to completely
[1828.14 → 1828.86] open your bag.
[1828.98 → 1830.62] You just open where the power cable is.
[1831.00 → 1832.22] Then on the inside of the bag.
[1832.28 → 1834.14] So you can charge your laptop or whatever else.
[1834.28 → 1834.50] Yeah.
[1834.50 → 1836.62] Doesn't it come with...
[1836.62 → 1839.86] I thought I saw in their video that it like came with a battery bank or something.
[1841.46 → 1843.24] I don't want to say it does if it doesn't.
[1843.24 → 1843.60] Here.
[1843.88 → 1844.18] Yeah.
[1844.50 → 1845.26] Is it in the notes?
[1846.86 → 1847.94] You know what it does have?
[1848.06 → 1848.70] Is a...
[1848.70 → 1849.88] There's a waterproof pocket.
[1849.98 → 1852.12] There's a pocket over here just for your water bottle.
[1853.08 → 1855.32] So you put your water in there, and it's completely sealed off.
[1855.38 → 1855.90] Everything's safe.
[1856.00 → 1860.36] And if your bag's too full, you can pull that out and just have the water hanging on the
[1860.36 → 1860.64] outside.
[1860.72 → 1861.14] That's cool.
[1861.28 → 1861.84] I like that.
[1862.04 → 1866.62] But attached to that power cable is a standard power plug for like your laptop or something.
[1866.76 → 1870.24] And then two USB ports, which is actually pretty sweet.
[1870.66 → 1871.44] I like that a lot.
[1871.62 → 1876.42] Because then you can charge your laptop, and you can charge your mobile devices.
[1876.42 → 1878.30] It has a pass-through right here into the front.
[1878.38 → 1881.76] So if you have your phone lodged up in the front or something, then that will work.
[1882.78 → 1885.50] But yeah, you can charge your battery bank.
[1885.60 → 1889.30] You can charge your phone and your laptop all by plugging your backpack into the wall
[1889.30 → 1890.74] without needing to take anything out of it.
[1890.94 → 1891.84] That's super cool.
[1891.94 → 1894.62] If you're a commuter or something like that, you just want to come home and plug the bag
[1894.62 → 1894.78] in.
[1894.82 → 1896.10] You don't want to take all your stuff out.
[1896.36 → 1897.24] That's fantastic.
[1899.24 → 1902.12] They call that a Reach-C power adapter.
[1903.20 → 1903.94] Pretty cool.
[1904.02 → 1909.46] It's a 60-watt USB Type-C port for a MacBook or other Type-C device.
[1910.10 → 1910.86] That is sweet.
[1912.12 → 1913.12] But yeah, great backpack.
[1913.46 → 1914.32] Feel free to check it out.
[1914.68 → 1918.60] Also, last sponsor is Savage Jerky.
[1920.58 → 1920.94] Savage.
[1921.52 → 1922.34] Savage Jerky.
[1923.90 → 1924.54] Savage Jerky.
[1924.70 → 1925.84] They've been on the show a million times.
[1925.92 → 1927.92] You guys kind of know what it's about, but I'm going to go over it anyway.
[1928.36 → 1932.02] Jerky is made with the best ingredients without nitrates or preservatives.
[1932.02 → 1933.98] Their goal is to create a snack that's full of flavour.
[1935.12 → 1937.74] And just it isn't supposed to be bad for you either.
[1937.88 → 1938.38] That's cool.
[1938.38 → 1940.32] People seem to like the Sriracha bacon.
[1940.50 → 1941.72] Apparently, that's quite popular.
[1942.26 → 1945.02] I like pretty much everything they have.
[1945.02 → 1950.06] It's like every one of these bags is open because they always get eaten.
[1950.24 → 1950.58] They do.
[1950.98 → 1952.64] People find the box and then steal them.
[1952.64 → 1954.46] My favourite personal one is Moho.
[1954.66 → 1957.10] But again, I like literally all of their flavours.
[1957.22 → 1958.34] So that works for me.
[1958.78 → 1963.16] You can use offer code LTT to save 10% off their products, which is cool.
[1963.74 → 1966.06] And they also have one of them.
[1966.14 → 1967.40] I'm not sure where it is.
[1967.40 → 1970.94] Because Ivan keeps eating it, so it could be gone.
[1971.16 → 1975.52] But one of theirs is made with the hottest peppers in the world, the Carolina Reaper.
[1975.96 → 1977.32] They have a Reaper jerky.
[1977.66 → 1978.30] Oh, yes.
[1978.42 → 1979.62] That's pretty dang hot.
[1979.62 → 1981.50] It'll probably kick your butt.
[1981.98 → 1984.38] So if you're into that, feel free to check it out.
[1985.98 → 1987.38] And we're back.
[1987.56 → 1988.32] Oh, we're going back.
[1988.40 → 1989.06] What do you want to do now?
[1989.12 → 1990.14] Oh, let's talk about Alexa.
[1990.50 → 1990.72] Oops.
[1990.84 → 1991.56] Sorry, I said it.
[1991.86 → 1992.54] Amazon Echo.
[1992.54 → 1993.14] Oh, no.
[1994.66 → 1998.62] So there is a family in, I believe, Oregon, Portland.
[1999.62 → 2000.78] And they were hanging out.
[2000.78 → 2004.28] And suddenly a phone call came in to the husband.
[2004.78 → 2008.18] And it was one of his employees who live in, I believe, Seattle.
[2008.94 → 2010.32] Many, many miles away.
[2010.76 → 2016.20] And the guy was like, quick, unplug all your A-L-E-X-A devices.
[2016.74 → 2018.08] You're getting hacked.
[2018.82 → 2022.06] And what had happened was, for whatever reason,
[2022.54 → 2027.26] the Echo started recording at a time that the inhabitants of the house
[2027.26 → 2031.04] did not know it was recording and recorded a big conversation they had.
[2031.34 → 2037.30] Then it proceeded to send the audio files to a random person in their contact list.
[2038.34 → 2039.40] And so this guy called.
[2039.68 → 2044.04] And the husband's like, what are you talking about?
[2044.26 → 2044.98] You're just joking.
[2045.20 → 2045.76] Like, yeah, right.
[2045.88 → 2046.16] Ha ha.
[2046.24 → 2046.58] Good one.
[2046.62 → 2048.56] And the guy's like, no, you were talking about your hardwood floors.
[2049.12 → 2049.92] Like, I heard it.
[2049.96 → 2050.76] And they're like, oh, God.
[2050.76 → 2053.16] And so then they contacted Amazon.
[2053.42 → 2056.24] And Amazon put an engineer to investigate right away.
[2056.80 → 2058.46] And eventually a statement came out.
[2058.58 → 2061.60] First, the engineer said, like, there will be a fix.
[2062.32 → 2063.46] It kind of made it seem.
[2063.60 → 2065.14] He didn't just brush it off as user error.
[2065.24 → 2066.40] He was like, we're going to fix something.
[2066.68 → 2068.08] But then the statement comes out.
[2068.48 → 2071.78] And it's kind of, it's not user error.
[2071.78 → 2075.42] But the system acted kind of as intended.
[2075.80 → 2078.44] So here's what the where the heck are we here?
[2079.32 → 2080.90] Here's the here's the, the events.
[2081.00 → 2081.38] What happened?
[2082.38 → 2087.40] Echo woke up due to a word in a background conversation sounding like the hot word.
[2087.40 → 2093.54] Then the subsequent conversation was heard as send message request.
[2093.66 → 2097.20] At which point the echo said out loud to whom?
[2097.88 → 2101.74] Now, if the volume was turned down, and they were ranked far away, then they wouldn't have heard that.
[2101.80 → 2101.96] Right.
[2103.06 → 2108.30] At which point the background conversation was interpreted as a name in the customer's contact list.
[2108.30 → 2113.36] So they kept having this conversation and the echo was just kind of picking out where it's like, I think it said send message.
[2113.48 → 2115.10] I think it said to Craig.
[2115.90 → 2120.38] And then, and then it carried out that, that request.
[2120.46 → 2127.14] And so as unlikely as a string of events like that is, Amazon is evaluating the options to make the case even less likely.
[2127.64 → 2133.50] At the same time, like, you have, you have a smart home device.
[2133.72 → 2133.80] Yeah.
[2133.80 → 2136.80] How often have you had it spring up and do something weird?
[2136.80 → 2138.74] Lately, it seems like more than before.
[2138.98 → 2139.42] Quite a bit.
[2139.42 → 2139.58] Yeah, I have too.
[2139.76 → 2140.22] Quite a bit.
[2140.46 → 2143.78] So I've got my, my Google Home Mini.
[2144.44 → 2150.74] I've gone into the settings and, and turned on the settings so that when you hail it, it goes banding, which is off by default.
[2151.28 → 2152.42] Normally it just would light up.
[2152.46 → 2157.30] And I had people across the house, they'd be trying to hail it, and maybe they're not very experienced with it.
[2157.32 → 2159.40] And they wouldn't know whether it had heard them.
[2159.54 → 2161.28] So I put on the feedback noise.
[2161.28 → 2167.78] But that's also super helpful too, because then if I'm watching a movie and the movie says something like, no, you go.
[2168.60 → 2173.20] And that sounds like, hey, then I'll hear it.
[2173.46 → 2174.82] And I can just say, never mind.
[2174.94 → 2176.52] And it'll, it'll turn off again.
[2176.52 → 2193.42] But I guess what's happening here is the way that these, that this, that machine learning works basically with this kind of thing is there's a probability that when I hear something, it'll say, okay, that's a that's a 0.8 out of one.
[2193.54 → 2196.62] Let's say there's an 80% chance that they just said what I think they said.
[2196.76 → 2198.42] And then there's a decision threshold.
[2198.42 → 2203.54] So the engineers will say anything greater than a 0.75 is good.
[2203.86 → 2206.78] And so that counts as, we're going to call that a positive.
[2207.04 → 2212.94] So you can shift that decision threshold based on the stakes of whatever you're talking about.
[2213.00 → 2223.14] So if you're talking about a spam email, for example, calling something, letting in spam when it's not spam, that's not that high stakes.
[2223.14 → 2227.60] Cause then you log into your email, and you have a you have some spam in there, and you're like, oh, that's annoying.
[2227.72 → 2228.66] I'm just going to delete it.
[2228.66 → 2237.92] But calling it an email that is not spam, spam is, can be catastrophic because then you don't get back to the client, or you miss an important appointment or whatever.
[2238.28 → 2248.12] So what they need to do to fix this, I think, is they're probably going to have to adjust the decision threshold so that they get less false or fewer false positives.
[2248.56 → 2251.98] But then the flip side of that you are going to be like, it's going to be more frustrating to use.
[2251.98 → 2256.60] Hey, and it's not going to hear you when there's music playing or something like that.
[2256.64 → 2258.72] So they just need to dance around that.
[2259.22 → 2259.40] Yeah.
[2260.38 → 2269.22] It's, it's, that's an extremely delicate and difficult thing to do, especially because there's going to be so many different environments that it's going to be used in.
[2269.28 → 2272.04] There's going to be so many different accents, vocal levels.
[2272.18 → 2273.02] Some people are quiet.
[2273.22 → 2274.08] Some people are loud.
[2274.08 → 2277.54] Like it's, they're probably going to have to personalize it on a per-user basis.
[2278.10 → 2280.64] Just have it learn each one learn its own owner.
[2280.86 → 2281.30] Yeah.
[2281.30 → 2281.98] That'd be cool.
[2282.46 → 2285.22] Well, I mean, I know that the Google one does that already for my voice.
[2285.46 → 2286.38] They have voice match.
[2286.58 → 2286.62] Yeah.
[2286.62 → 2293.52] So it's like when I say call mom, it calls my mom or plays good music to me is different from good music to my wife who's just listens to dead most.
[2293.62 → 2294.20] And that's it.
[2295.08 → 2295.88] Strobe is a good song.
[2296.68 → 2297.76] She learned that on the piano.
[2297.86 → 2298.56] We got a piano.
[2298.80 → 2300.28] She only learned that song.
[2300.28 → 2302.42] It was like, it was not easy.
[2302.56 → 2304.42] So it took her like months.
[2304.52 → 2305.14] That's all she played.
[2305.22 → 2306.06] And then she figured it out.
[2306.12 → 2307.26] And then she never played piano again.
[2307.32 → 2312.50] I was like, you need to, you would learn the song faster if you just learned easy songs first.
[2314.54 → 2315.42] That's fantastic.
[2315.42 → 2315.58] Fantastic.
[2315.58 → 2320.78] Speaking of fantastic or not, essential is up for sale.
[2320.98 → 2322.06] Like the phone company.
[2322.30 → 2322.86] It's a rumour.
[2323.80 → 2324.42] It's a rumour.
[2324.64 → 2327.24] They haven't officially announced it, but it's come.
[2327.24 → 2329.84] The story's coming from, you know, those in the know.
[2330.74 → 2331.10] Yeah.
[2332.18 → 2333.10] I hate rumours.
[2333.22 → 2334.18] So I'm not really that interested.
[2334.40 → 2337.60] But apparently the next phone, also rumour, has been cancelled.
[2337.76 → 2338.30] Also rumour.
[2339.46 → 2340.80] So I don't know.
[2341.66 → 2342.34] Do people care?
[2343.20 → 2345.20] A lot of people seem to care.
[2345.30 → 2350.52] I saw a lot of comments in the forum that were like, I didn't buy it, but I was interested in it.
[2350.56 → 2353.12] And I was about to buy it, or I was planning on buying the next iteration.
[2354.26 → 2357.14] Because I actually didn't really know much about the essential phone.
[2357.14 → 2359.82] And I was looking at it today, and I was like, that thing's sick.
[2360.28 → 2360.54] Yeah.
[2360.80 → 2361.42] It's sweet.
[2361.84 → 2365.32] So I actually kind of recommended it to a few different people.
[2365.70 → 2370.30] Or at least the idea of looking into it and comparing it for their own option.
[2371.32 → 2375.86] But I don't know public wise, like how much people care.
[2375.86 → 2377.26] They didn't do a lot of advertising.
[2378.56 → 2384.38] They didn't have like a had a lot of fanfare, maybe in tech circles, but for the public, not sure.
[2384.90 → 2385.80] It looked pretty bold.
[2385.80 → 2387.74] I mean, this was the first phone with a notch.
[2388.22 → 2390.24] It came out before the iPhone 10.
[2390.62 → 2392.18] And the notch is smaller.
[2392.44 → 2395.64] It's almost completely, completely bezel-less.
[2395.78 → 2397.18] It's nice looking.
[2398.74 → 2399.44] I care.
[2399.66 → 2400.22] I care.
[2400.48 → 2401.76] Samsung or Apple only.
[2401.94 → 2402.58] Or I don't care.
[2404.32 → 2405.58] Samsung or Apple only.
[2405.64 → 2406.80] What about like Google phones?
[2407.50 → 2408.64] That, that would be I don't care.
[2408.64 → 2410.78] Or I care.
[2411.06 → 2411.48] One of the two.
[2412.42 → 2418.54] The Samsung or Apple only option is like a weird way of me being like, nah, I'm not really
[2418.54 → 2419.16] that into phones.
[2419.94 → 2420.76] Oh, okay.
[2420.80 → 2420.90] Interesting.
[2420.90 → 2424.42] Because I, I, I see when people don't really know phones to that, that much.
[2424.52 → 2427.28] They're like, oh, I don't know if I should buy an Apple or a Samsung.
[2427.28 → 2431.18] Because they just don't even, like the Android category is seen as Samsung.
[2431.20 → 2431.94] You know what I get a lot?
[2432.38 → 2434.04] Especially when iPhone 10s were new.
[2435.04 → 2436.36] This would be sitting on the table.
[2436.56 → 2437.36] Is that an iPhone 10?
[2437.86 → 2438.54] No, it's not.
[2438.94 → 2439.86] Oh, what is that thing?
[2440.22 → 2441.36] It's an LG V30.
[2442.58 → 2443.64] Interest lost.
[2444.06 → 2444.68] An LG?
[2445.54 → 2448.38] I've heard of a guy and get roasted at the bar.
[2448.46 → 2450.46] He's trying to wheel some lady and get.
[2450.54 → 2451.08] Wait, what?
[2451.20 → 2451.94] Got roasted.
[2452.56 → 2455.28] Uh, like, she's like, what kind of phone is that?
[2455.32 → 2456.12] It's like, oh, it's an LG.
[2456.28 → 2456.70] She's just like.
[2457.52 → 2457.86] What?
[2457.88 → 2459.26] It's like iPhone or die.
[2460.02 → 2463.12] Like, delete your Tinder.
[2463.24 → 2463.86] You have an LG.
[2466.08 → 2469.64] Like, I don't actually really want to have an LG, but this is a sweet phone.
[2469.86 → 2471.70] Like, they just have quality control issues.
[2471.78 → 2472.34] I don't really dig.
[2472.34 → 2474.88] Like, this is like my third one, just incidentally.
[2475.26 → 2477.02] And everyone's had, like, the same kind of problem.
[2477.10 → 2479.14] Like, it doesn't detect my SIM or something like that.
[2479.48 → 2480.70] I really liked a G3.
[2480.84 → 2481.58] I had an LG G3.
[2481.82 → 2482.02] Yeah.
[2482.06 → 2482.98] I really liked that phone.
[2483.30 → 2484.50] So, most people don't care.
[2484.74 → 2486.82] 51% of people say I don't care.
[2486.90 → 2487.44] Straight up.
[2489.20 → 2492.28] 18% of people say Samsung or Apple only.
[2492.72 → 2495.00] I expected there would be a surprising percentage there.
[2495.52 → 2497.28] And then 31% of people care.
[2497.38 → 2498.90] That's actually way more than I thought.
[2499.46 → 2499.70] Well.
[2500.28 → 2501.34] So, that's cool.
[2501.34 → 2507.26] The thing with the essential phone was that it was, like, the closest to stock Android you could get outside a Pixel.
[2507.50 → 2508.36] And that's awesome.
[2508.98 → 2509.30] Amazing.
[2509.56 → 2509.78] Yeah.
[2510.26 → 2512.22] And it was way cheaper, eventually.
[2512.44 → 2513.40] When it launched, it was $700.
[2513.74 → 2517.30] I don't think it could have competed against other flagships in that price range.
[2517.36 → 2522.54] But when they were struggling, and they dropped it to $500 or even less, then it was, like, a hell of a deal.
[2523.90 → 2525.14] Maybe they should have opened up with that.
[2525.20 → 2527.20] But then they had $300 million of investment.
[2527.20 → 2529.12] They spent $100 million of it developing the phone.
[2529.22 → 2531.04] So, they just needed to sell these things.
[2531.80 → 2531.92] Yeah.
[2532.08 → 2535.60] Essential raised about $300 million from several investors, like you just mentioned.
[2535.84 → 2536.20] Tencent.
[2536.62 → 2537.06] Yeah.
[2537.26 → 2540.34] Tencent, the least surprising group on this list ever.
[2541.06 → 2544.08] Amazon.com and Repoint Ventures as well.
[2544.22 → 2548.54] It was valued at $900 million to a billion dollars a year ago.
[2548.54 → 2554.66] So, if it is indeed for sale today, it would probably be a lot less than that.
[2554.74 → 2556.96] I would also assume the same.
[2558.10 → 2561.26] Current discussions are focused on, again, this is rumours.
[2561.54 → 2573.96] Current discussions are focused on a sale of the entire company, including its patent portfolio and hardware products like the original smartphone, an upcoming smart home device, and a camera attachment for the phone.
[2573.96 → 2585.78] Essential's engineering talent, which includes those hired from Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google, would likely be a part of the deal, which is probably quite valuable.
[2585.96 → 2590.04] Do you think the founder of Android who made this, what's his name, Rubin?
[2590.30 → 2590.80] Andy Rubin.
[2590.90 → 2592.32] Would also be in that market?
[2592.40 → 2592.44] Yeah.
[2592.74 → 2593.42] I don't know.
[2593.46 → 2595.14] Or is he the one selling it and getting the heck out?
[2595.14 → 2595.62] Maybe.
[2596.02 → 2605.34] But there could be one of those, like, don't remember the name of it right now, but it's those clauses where when the company gets bought, you have to, like, stay on in order to get the good chunk of the money.
[2605.56 → 2606.34] Golden handcuffs.
[2606.86 → 2607.06] Yeah.
[2607.14 → 2607.96] People call that.
[2608.44 → 2608.96] Not necessarily.
[2609.20 → 2609.82] Golden handcuffs is a used.
[2609.84 → 2611.34] That's not necessarily with mergers.
[2611.50 → 2612.76] That's just, like, any employee.
[2612.92 → 2613.10] Yeah.
[2613.38 → 2618.20] Like, it takes four years for your shares to invest or whatever, so you kind of need to stick around before you get the real money.
[2618.52 → 2618.74] Yeah.
[2618.92 → 2620.84] Golden handcuffs is used for a bunch of different stuff.
[2621.70 → 2624.32] Just when it has to do with, like, I am staying because of money.
[2625.14 → 2625.50] Wow.
[2630.50 → 2634.44] Apple and Volkswagen are apparently going to be making driverless cars.
[2637.00 → 2640.06] It's an interesting two names to be in the top.
[2640.06 → 2647.92] The Apple making a driverless car thing has been, that was guessed by Linus, like, five years ago or something like that.
[2649.68 → 2650.92] It makes a lot of sense.
[2651.04 → 2651.28] It does.
[2651.28 → 2658.46] Since they like design, the holy grail of design, of industrial design is cars, so it's a pretty easy guess.
[2658.64 → 2666.20] But it's been a roller coaster since they did announce that they were going to make a car that was going to disrupt Detroit and just kick all the butt.
[2666.20 → 2677.22] But then they scaled that back to being like, well, it's actually really hard to make a car, so why don't we just, we'll make the internal components and all the sensors and everything for the self-driving.
[2677.34 → 2682.98] And we'll partner with someone like BMW because Tim Cook loves BMW or with Mercedes.
[2682.98 → 2693.14] And then those companies were like, nope, because Apple wanted to control all the data or some other aspect that those companies, they bailed.
[2693.42 → 2697.30] So it's like they're, and then they had negotiations with, I believe, Lexus.
[2697.42 → 2699.20] Now they're on their, like, their fourth choice Volkswagen.
[2699.34 → 2700.34] It's like, yeah, we'd love to work with you.
[2700.34 → 2708.68] And they're not even, it's going to be like a standard Volkswagen, what is it?
[2709.26 → 2710.94] It's a particular model here.
[2712.00 → 2712.48] T6?
[2712.76 → 2714.00] Yeah, T6 van.
[2715.34 → 2716.34] T6 transporter.
[2717.36 → 2728.00] The frame, wheels, and chassis of the T6 vans will remain, but Apple is replacing many components such as the dashboard and the seats, the computers and sensors, and they're, of course, putting in a large electric car battery.
[2728.00 → 2731.26] Now, this isn't going to be a consumer product.
[2732.02 → 2732.22] Oh.
[2732.70 → 2736.58] No, it's not like they're just, they're making these vans, and you're going to be able to buy one.
[2736.76 → 2741.10] This is a project for them to just start getting their feet wet with self-driving.
[2741.24 → 2748.78] It's going to be a van that transports their own employees between various Apple campuses so they can, it's kind of closed doors.
[2748.78 → 2753.04] That's an interesting, like, hey, if you screw up your engineering project, you'll kill all your friends.
[2753.80 → 2755.46] Like, wow.
[2755.46 → 2755.58] Wow.
[2756.24 → 2758.42] Yeah, make sure you do it well, guys.
[2759.44 → 2759.68] Yeah.
[2759.80 → 2761.18] That's interesting.
[2761.50 → 2769.50] I was very surprised to read the like, not going to be initially commercially available except for literally just themselves line.
[2769.62 → 2772.98] But that's probably a fairly sensible way of going about that.
[2773.28 → 2774.86] Yeah, apparently it's been quite a cluster.
[2774.86 → 2781.14] There's no indication right now if Volkswagen will be on for anything beyond the internal van experiment.
[2781.74 → 2787.00] And according to the article that we cited here from the New York Times, there was a bunch of...
[2787.00 → 2787.82] Okay, sorry.
[2787.92 → 2788.54] Someone in chat.
[2788.70 → 2790.14] Will they call it the bandwagon?
[2791.30 → 2792.16] I love it.
[2792.72 → 2793.46] I don't get it.
[2793.64 → 2796.08] Because the first topic of the show.
[2796.50 → 2796.92] Oh, nice.
[2796.92 → 2799.80] I like it.
[2801.02 → 2801.90] I think it's good.
[2802.18 → 2803.22] They would never call it that.
[2803.28 → 2804.08] That doesn't make sense.
[2804.60 → 2805.82] That joke doesn't make sense.
[2806.88 → 2807.86] Oh, I disagree.
[2809.62 → 2810.44] It's not good enough.
[2810.44 → 2814.12] They would call that, like, impeccably designed, engineered with purpose wagon.
[2815.62 → 2816.94] It's a feature, not a bug.
[2817.28 → 2817.94] Wagon 6.
[2818.84 → 2819.40] wagon.
[2819.40 → 2823.50] But so all the reporting came from ex-employees.
[2823.62 → 2825.94] And they basically said that the whole project was this brutal.
[2826.30 → 2826.78] Executives.
[2829.36 → 2829.80] Executives.
[2829.98 → 2834.66] Leading Apple's car project had told Tim Cook that the shuttle would be completed by the end of 2018.
[2834.66 → 2838.62] But that deadline will almost certainly be missed, according to one of these people.
[2838.62 → 2845.14] And they also said that the project reportedly lacks a clear plan beyond the vans, including any near-term commercial goals.
[2845.70 → 2846.62] So it's...
[2847.14 → 2848.32] Hey, there's a big wave.
[2848.44 → 2849.34] We need to hop on.
[2849.34 → 2849.58] They're just trying to do a thing.
[2849.64 → 2851.10] But we don't really know what to do.
[2851.28 → 2852.32] Steve Jobs is dead.
[2853.32 → 2854.38] Help us.
[2854.46 → 2856.62] We're not making very good company decisions.
[2857.02 → 2858.74] Johnny Ive just wants to design fashion.
[2859.20 → 2860.62] Speaking of company decisions...
[2861.40 → 2863.16] Best segue.
[2863.52 → 2865.44] Amazon bans users for too many returns.
[2866.86 → 2867.30] Boom.
[2867.30 → 2868.82] CNET article.
[2869.04 → 2869.72] Apparently...
[2869.72 → 2870.50] You buy, you keep.
[2870.96 → 2871.26] Yeah.
[2871.46 → 2876.16] Amazon is banning customers who take advantage of its generous return policy and closing their accounts.
[2876.54 → 2879.90] According to the National Retail Federation, 11% of sales are returned.
[2880.60 → 2884.10] That seems like a lot compared to my track record of returning things.
[2884.30 → 2888.82] And 11% of those are fraudulent, which sounds super coincidental, but whatever.
[2888.82 → 2892.46] They have 300 million customers.
[2892.86 → 2898.06] Customers are not being warned of bans, but Amazon has reinstated the accounts of those
[2898.06 → 2900.06] that appeal convincingly.
[2900.06 → 2904.66] Yeah, because a lot of people are really mad because they get banned.
[2905.70 → 2912.14] And they're like, I returned six things in the last year, which is depending on how much
[2912.14 → 2912.54] you buy.
[2912.62 → 2913.56] It could be a lot or not.
[2913.56 → 2916.08] And then each one of those things had a good reason.
[2916.44 → 2918.02] You know, it sucked.
[2918.22 → 2919.30] It didn't...
[2919.30 → 2922.48] The things in the box weren't what was expected or whatever.
[2923.42 → 2928.60] So, but I don't blame Amazon for not giving some kind of threshold.
[2928.60 → 2930.56] Like, you need to...
[2930.56 → 2935.52] If you return more than X per year or if you return 15% of your stuff, then you're going
[2935.52 → 2936.12] to get banned.
[2936.18 → 2939.62] It's obviously they're not going to give those numbers out because then people will just game
[2939.62 → 2940.78] it and just...
[2940.78 → 2941.54] And ride that line.
[2941.54 → 2941.98] Ride right along.
[2942.00 → 2944.64] And return as much stuff as they can while still getting away with it.
[2944.66 → 2947.18] So, it makes sense that they would do that.
[2947.20 → 2951.66] Or like buy a bunch of really, really low ticket things they don't care about and then
[2951.66 → 2954.46] screw with your return policy on the higher stuff.
[2954.56 → 2954.92] I don't know.
[2955.62 → 2956.44] But yeah, I get it.
[2956.44 → 2958.00] It also makes sense that if you...
[2958.00 → 2961.82] Like, first, they need to clean out this kind of behaviour because it's a lot of
[2961.82 → 2961.98] money.
[2962.14 → 2963.38] You're talking about that many returns.
[2963.60 → 2965.30] That makes an impact.
[2965.44 → 2969.62] That's millions of dollars on the top line or bottom line or whatever line makes sense.
[2969.66 → 2970.40] I don't really know finance.
[2971.74 → 2976.36] And it also makes sense to just ban everyone in one fell swoop and then just take on the
[2976.36 → 2977.52] appeals as they come in.
[2978.28 → 2983.22] And then a human can just directly deal with it and then reinstate your account if you're
[2983.22 → 2983.80] worthy of that.
[2983.80 → 2988.86] Something they can probably do, and the wording of that made it sound like they're probably
[2988.86 → 2992.70] doing this, is like, if you appeal, you'll probably get back in.
[2993.10 → 2993.96] Well, I wrote that.
[2994.24 → 2994.54] Okay.
[2994.56 → 2995.56] That wasn't even copy-paste.
[2995.60 → 2996.68] Well, all right then.
[2996.80 → 2998.46] But I bet you it's that way anyway.
[2999.06 → 3001.06] If you appeal, you'll probably be fine.
[3001.74 → 3002.00] Yeah.
[3002.00 → 3005.54] If you're like, yeah, well, I just didn't, they're all problems.
[3005.80 → 3007.04] They'll probably let you back in.
[3008.54 → 3014.36] Because most people, if you ban someone, and it was like, okay, no, that's not true because
[3014.36 → 3015.44] of moderating on the forum.
[3015.86 → 3019.26] People will do terrible things, and then you ban them, and they're like, what?
[3019.64 → 3021.14] So, yeah, no, I don't know, actually.
[3021.14 → 3027.18] I think it's going to be easy for them to keep banned the people they ban who are actually
[3027.18 → 3029.56] offenders of this in a big way.
[3029.96 → 3035.44] Like the people who are buying 800 things a year, returning 700 things or something like
[3035.44 → 3035.78] that.
[3036.52 → 3039.46] Or just like repeatedly buying a TV and returning it so they can have...
[3039.46 → 3041.68] Yeah, or some kind of other discernible pattern like that.
[3042.46 → 3042.84] Yeah.
[3043.00 → 3047.74] I feel like it'll have to be pretty blatant for them to like to keep your ban after an appeal.
[3048.38 → 3048.72] Yeah.
[3048.96 → 3050.02] I know that they do.
[3050.28 → 3051.86] They're pretty savage with some other things.
[3051.96 → 3054.50] I was talking to a friend who has an Amazon...
[3054.50 → 3057.82] He's like an Amazon seller for a business as his business.
[3058.32 → 3061.48] And they're really strict about fake reviews, right?
[3061.80 → 3065.80] But what they're doing was like, they'll actually send you a product for you to review.
[3066.80 → 3068.66] So you bought it from them.
[3068.66 → 3071.24] You can be a real buyer of the product.
[3071.40 → 3072.44] And then you get the product.
[3072.64 → 3074.38] And then you're supposed to give a five-star review.
[3074.96 → 3081.08] And the way that they did this was that they gave discounts to all of those potential reviewers.
[3081.96 → 3084.80] Because you don't want to like to sell an item full price.
[3084.92 → 3088.60] Amazon takes a large part of that just to get this.
[3088.66 → 3090.28] That's like a high cost for a fake review.
[3090.36 → 3093.22] You want to get your fake review at the cheapest level possible.
[3093.40 → 3094.28] So then you just...
[3094.28 → 3096.30] If it's a $100 item, you send it...
[3096.30 → 3097.32] Give them 95% off.
[3097.32 → 3098.22] So it's like five bucks.
[3098.22 → 3100.20] And then Amazon just gets a dollar or whatever.
[3100.40 → 3101.58] And then you get your fake review.
[3101.70 → 3106.24] So what Amazon did is they went through, and they said any item that was sold at a discount was...
[3106.24 → 3107.30] All those reviews are gone now.
[3107.66 → 3109.98] So you just lost like a third of your reviews.
[3110.20 → 3110.34] Good.
[3111.34 → 3111.94] I don't know.
[3112.16 → 3113.28] I think that's completely okay.
[3113.50 → 3114.74] Because the amount of like...
[3114.74 → 3117.56] Well, unless you actually just had a discount code or something like that.
[3117.62 → 3118.28] That was legit.
[3118.62 → 3120.08] And all those people were like super happy.
[3120.14 → 3121.30] Yeah, I tried it for the first time.
[3121.56 → 3122.08] It's great.
[3122.08 → 3127.28] I just came to Amazon.com slash WAN or whatever and got my product and I loved it.
[3127.72 → 3131.74] And here's a five-star review that's legit, but it's gone now because they're throwing at the baby with the bathwater.
[3132.08 → 3132.22] Yeah.
[3132.26 → 3132.48] Okay.
[3132.52 → 3132.90] That's fair.
[3133.48 → 3134.04] I just...
[3134.04 → 3136.74] Something that drove me insane was I was...
[3136.74 → 3142.04] I'm not going to disclose who largely because I don't know if they ever actually ended up doing anything with this guy.
[3142.70 → 3146.16] I know the guy was there, but I don't know what type of association there was.
[3146.20 → 3148.42] I don't know if they were actually doing any business, etc, etc.
[3148.42 → 3149.54] So I'm not going to say the company name.
[3149.64 → 3154.46] But one year at CES, I went to a company's hotel suite to film a video.
[3155.08 → 3157.86] And there was a dude there, and he was hanging out, and I was waiting for my meeting.
[3157.94 → 3159.46] So I was just like, hey, let's talk.
[3160.74 → 3161.80] We're both overtired.
[3161.90 → 3162.42] We're at CES.
[3162.56 → 3163.36] Let's chat about stuff.
[3163.70 → 3164.64] Just asked him what he did.
[3164.64 → 3174.04] He was one of the business acquisition guys for a company that posts fake reviews on Amazon.
[3174.96 → 3176.50] It was a whole giant company.
[3176.80 → 3178.70] There's a huge industry of click farms.
[3179.20 → 3181.94] People do all days create accounts and then like pages.
[3182.40 → 3184.04] He was essentially one of those guys.
[3184.28 → 3188.28] And I remember I may have not been the nicest person.
[3190.10 → 3190.92] You're evil.
[3191.16 → 3191.52] You're a jerk.
[3192.18 → 3193.26] You are a dirt.
[3194.64 → 3196.42] You are a single unit of dirt.
[3197.56 → 3199.08] Because it kind of pissed me off.
[3199.26 → 3201.44] But like these are absolutely a thing.
[3201.86 → 3202.12] Oh, yeah.
[3202.32 → 3204.20] They're running around CES with badges.
[3204.56 → 3205.66] Like this was.
[3205.88 → 3208.16] Yeah, this is a pretty big industry.
[3208.16 → 3209.48] So I'm very happy that they're shutting it down.
[3209.48 → 3212.34] I think that in some countries it's like a large sector.
[3212.92 → 3215.16] Just like tourism is a big sector in some countries.
[3215.40 → 3215.54] Yeah.
[3215.72 → 3219.86] Click farms is like a big deal in individual particular countries.
[3219.86 → 3222.42] Just like scams are in some parts of Western Africa.
[3222.56 → 3225.90] It's like we're all we're all making money just scamming North America.
[3226.04 → 3229.50] Those phone numbers that call you and try to get your banking info.
[3229.62 → 3229.98] Baskerville.
[3230.74 → 3231.18] Baskerville.
[3231.74 → 3232.86] Baskerville is an interesting thing.
[3233.10 → 3235.00] Anyway, the show is over.
[3235.52 → 3235.78] Oh.
[3236.76 → 3237.18] Boom.
[3237.38 → 3237.72] See ya.
[3238.30 → 3238.76] Later.
[3240.38 → 3241.20] See ya never.
[3241.64 → 3242.66] Whatever, guys.
[3242.66 → 3244.00] I'll see you next week.
[3244.22 → 3244.58] Bye.
[3245.72 → 3248.10] Can I say what we're doing next week?
[3248.44 → 3249.28] I don't know.
[3251.90 → 3255.16] Better just sign up for Plot flame Club.
[3255.50 → 3258.54] And then get early access to whatever it is we're doing.
[3258.94 → 3260.04] On Plot flame Club.
[3260.86 → 3261.16] Yes.
[3261.90 → 3262.24] All right.
[3262.46 → 3262.92] Bye, guys.
[3264.14 → 3265.56] We're filming Scraper on the list next week.
[3265.56 → 3266.56] AHHHHH!
