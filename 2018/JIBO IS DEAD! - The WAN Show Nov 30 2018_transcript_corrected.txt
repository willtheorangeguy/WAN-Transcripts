[0.00 → 5.50] earlier this week did you tune into that disaster by any chance were you streaming it while
[5.50 → 12.74] I was at work uh no oh well still no okay fair enough um so I did like a 10-year anniversary
[12.74 → 17.66] stream with Yvonne as kind of uh you and Yvonne have been together 10 years no, no we have well
[17.66 → 22.68] we've been together longer than that's really ambiguous yeah so it was 10 the 10-year Linus
[22.68 → 29.86] tech tips anniversary okay so Linus tech tips was started on the 25th of November 25th 26th
[29.86 → 39.08] whatever it was 25th or 26th of November 2008 10 years ago this whole enterprise began and uh so
[39.08 → 46.40] I thought it might be a cool idea to do like kind of a behind the scenes slash like q an uh like a get
[46.40 → 51.40] to know you for Yvonne because a lot of people think that like I brought my wife to work kind of
[51.40 → 56.62] thing like there's been a lot of comments about like what's his wife doing at work and what does
[56.62 → 66.38] that mean ridiculous it means that like okay and to be clear I get it because I worked at a place
[66.38 → 71.06] where the boss brought his wife to work what does bring your wife work mean brought your wife to
[71.06 → 80.12] work means that for some reason the owner of the company's wife is there every day and
[80.12 → 88.86] barking orders at people even though she clearly has no idea what's going on so in that if someone
[88.86 → 96.06] were to do that does the boss's wife uh have formal employment there yes okay she did in
[96.06 → 103.46] this case and of course Yvonne does here yeah so a lot of people seem to think that that's how things
[103.46 → 109.42] went down, but it's not at all she's actually been involved since basically day one um, and so I thought it
[109.42 → 114.08] would be cool to do like a stream to like kind of get to know her and find out you know what's what's
[114.08 → 120.52] going on or what she's done here over the years uh because it's not insignificant at all and I think
[120.52 → 125.18] it's just you're just lucky that your wife happened to be competent is that the only difference here
[125.18 → 133.58] um no because I don't see any reason why I would have involved her if she hadn't been yeah like and
[133.58 → 141.98] it's not just that like she drove me to make almost every major career decision that I have made
[141.98 → 146.96] in the last like we've actually been together like 13 years or something like that's been quite a long
[146.96 → 152.72] time only married for eight of it though um so she was the one actually driving me she drove me to
[152.72 → 160.64] drop out of school which to be clear was actually the correct decision for me um she only drove me to do
[160.64 → 163.98] that not because she doesn't believe in school she finished her degree she just knew it would have
[163.98 → 171.28] taken Linus forever to graduate maybe the plan was dependence she figured if I didn't get educated
[171.28 → 176.92] then I'd be stuck with her um yeah a lot of people don't know this actually that's another thing uh
[176.92 → 180.42] there's a lot of speculation that she's a gold digger actually
[180.42 → 189.60] she had much better prospects when we met than I did she's a pharmacist uh yes I don't know why she
[189.60 → 196.84] works here um so she was so she was in uh she was in pharmacy school when I met her so she had just
[196.84 → 202.16] she wasn't in the pharmacy program yet when we started dating, but she got in shortly after we
[202.16 → 208.14] started dating so she was on a very clear trajectory and I was on academic probation
[208.14 → 214.90] at UBC at that time so I was on a very clear trajectory as well why are we on probation I was
[214.90 → 219.36] on sexual harassment smoking in the boys room academic probation for getting poor grades
[219.36 → 224.98] academic probation so it was going to take you forever to graduate if I ever did no I would
[224.98 → 229.82] have gotten kicked out the only reason I didn't get kicked out was because I left you can't kick me
[229.82 → 234.56] out because I quit I'm out of here I'm out of here like they wouldn't, I don't think they would
[234.56 → 241.40] ever let me back in that school so um where were you taking I was taking general science and i
[241.40 → 245.92] couldn't pass calculus for the life of me she was your tutor was she not uh she was my tutor but that
[245.92 → 252.92] was only because there was an interest that was not because I was like out looking for a tutor i just
[252.92 → 256.74] wouldn't have found a tutor and I would have probably gotten an even worse grade if not for her
[256.74 → 262.40] and that would have been impressive actually because I got 19 the first time around
[262.40 → 271.04] in call 101 or 100 or whatever it is um so, so anyway what were we talking about right so
[271.04 → 277.54] anyway i so I remember making this joke at the time because I was around the time that I was dropping
[277.54 → 284.88] out to work for as a sales rep at a computer store and uh i so I forget what someone said to me but
[284.88 → 289.46] something like you know your wife's going to be the breadwinner in the future like this is
[289.46 → 293.42] speculation we weren't even close to getting married at that point and i kind of went yeah
[293.42 → 300.46] you know what we live in enlightened times you know there are men can go to university for their
[300.46 → 306.02] Mrs these days there's nothing wrong with that because there's this old sexist joke that men go
[306.02 → 312.22] to school men go to college or men go to university for their BAS their mas and their PhDs and what do
[312.22 → 317.88] women go to university for their Mrs, and so I was like so it's kind of like a play on that
[317.88 → 324.62] very terrible joke it means misses yeah it means they're gonna it means like marrying someone who's
[324.62 → 330.46] going to have a BA and NBA or a PhD that's so anyway i that that was all that I got out of school was my
[330.46 → 340.64] Mrs yeah uh well I mean I think it's like the trend is the other way now like almost the majority of
[340.64 → 345.84] couples I know the woman makes more really in my wife's friend group it's like that huh
[345.84 → 350.78] yeah maybe your wife's friend group though is just like highly educated driven women and
[350.78 → 354.38] maybe that's not necessarily well they're not highly educated they are highly driven they're all in
[354.38 → 362.52] sales just that's where the money's at sales is actually super underrated in terms of like oh you
[362.52 → 367.80] have grade 10, and you want to make 200 000 a year sales yeah career and personal planning should
[367.80 → 372.68] probably focus on sales skills and hold on give me one second I want to finish that thought from
[372.68 → 377.68] before the point is we tried to do that stream I managed to fail three times over the course of
[377.68 → 383.36] like four days we finally got it done last night go check it out like calculus um yeah actually my
[383.36 → 390.82] grade in streaming is slightly higher than calculus 25 uh it's so weird because in this world in this
[390.82 → 397.44] studio and in the YouTube world and this computer world like you know you're the master of your domain
[397.44 → 401.58] here in this little Linus world we live in, and it's weird for me to think of Linus like
[401.58 → 406.96] looking at a piece of paper and just being like I don't get it I don't know what to do I'm failing
[406.96 → 413.04] I was so frustrated like forget it I give up I can't think about this right now I'm just going to go
[413.04 → 420.34] play counterstrike that was, and she was like well you should just give up you
[420.34 → 425.72] should drop out it was less that it was more that I was sinking worse and worse into depression
[425.72 → 432.04] and clearly what I was doing with the painting business and school um where nothing was a success
[432.04 → 439.10] was not helping and this actually segues so perfectly into our talk about how important sales is
[439.10 → 445.72] because all of a sudden I had this opportunity to take this job at the computer store that was
[445.72 → 452.18] not a ton of money but because there was a commission there was the potential to kind of scale it
[452.18 → 459.52] and I was really passionate about it like I got a job at NCI because I was that kid on their forum
[459.52 → 468.68] that was constantly already a salesman and an ethical one like I wasn't about people just buying
[468.68 → 473.24] more I wasn't I wasn't even on commission I didn't even I wasn't even on the company payroll I was just
[473.24 → 480.50] hanging out on their forum because the NCI forum was quite frankly the ship back in like the mid 2000s
[480.50 → 485.98] it was awesome it was super active great community there fantastic people can't say enough
[485.98 → 493.04] um cam you know who you are you're awesome anyway your cam your cam um but uh but anyway so I was
[493.04 → 498.38] already this kid hanging out on their forum basically doing the sales job which is advising people of what
[498.38 → 504.56] the right thing to buy is and helping them pick it and making them making that relationship to NCI
[504.56 → 511.18] make it more likely that they probably buy it from NCI so even though they thought I was too young
[511.18 → 516.74] and they were looking for full-time people and I was only available part-time uh they made this
[516.74 → 524.68] kind of this weird exception for me and i and I started my job there, and it was it's amazing how much of
[524.68 → 532.74] life is sales and how applicable the sales skills that i kind of gained just by being an enthusiast and
[532.74 → 539.36] getting a job where my whole job was just to talk about my passion all day it's amazing how that
[539.36 → 547.26] is actually a big part of how I was able to end up where I am today and i I'll preach I'll preach sales
[547.26 → 554.74] training and sales skills all day to anyone who will listen because if you think about it what in
[554.74 → 559.26] life is not sales engineering
[559.26 → 566.46] yes but I would make the argument that without sales there's always aspects right the engineers
[566.46 → 570.64] are probably in trouble you got to make your pitch you got to make your pitch to get the funding to
[570.64 → 576.40] build the thing sure get the project approved sure there's sales and engineering come on well I mean
[576.40 → 580.80] YouTube chat give me something here it's synonymous with communication when you're going to be
[580.80 → 586.32] abstracted like that yes so and everything's communicating finding a partner in
[586.32 → 592.64] life sales you've got it you got to sell them on what's have I got a deal for you what's good about
[592.64 → 601.26] you know why they should care why they should go on that first date that's sales is all
[601.26 → 607.80] about persuasive communication and calling it sales I think is sort of unfair it's just that that's
[607.80 → 614.72] usually the word at the end of whatever job title it is or associate or whatever it's like
[614.72 → 621.22] the whole secretary receptionist thing you know uh, uh garbage men waste management you know technician
[621.22 → 626.88] whatever if it's if we're being honest with ourselves it's its sales but I think that also
[626.88 → 632.98] isn't really fair to the complexity of that position because it's all about building relationships and
[632.98 → 640.36] getting to know people and if you are genuinely good at it actually caring building real
[640.36 → 648.10] relationships that still exist beyond cutting the PO and making the payment transactional that's not
[648.10 → 653.22] real sales and I think that's where a lot of sales training sucks well actually sales has changed in the
[653.22 → 657.92] last couple decades because there used to be an information disparity between the customer and the
[657.92 → 662.66] salesperson where you walked in to buy a car you were dependent on the salesperson to tell you
[662.66 → 667.16] everything about the car because you had no way of finding that stuff out by yourself now we have
[667.16 → 672.22] the internet everyone has access to information you walk in the store knowing more about the thing you
[672.22 → 677.86] want to buy than the salesperson does so where in the past extra extroverts they really thrived as
[677.86 → 683.46] salespeople before now it's more of kind of you need to be in the middle of that spectrum so that you
[683.46 → 688.94] can listen to what the person already knows and what they want and then just help kind of funnel them
[688.94 → 696.34] and then pinko game to the best solution mathematics research Linus even then like you probably have to
[696.34 → 701.68] apply for like research grants and stuff you have to you have to get a job and like get tenure at a
[701.68 → 705.38] university or something before anyone's going to actually pay you to do mathematics research
[705.38 → 709.68] I don't know yeah it's a little it's a little tenuous because what you're talking about is true but
[709.68 → 713.98] it might be like two percent of their actual day-to-day job yes that's true plus they're going to get the
[713.98 → 720.56] tenure after publishing a bunch fair enough people have been we going to do news today
[720.56 → 724.62] are we going to roll the intro sure let's roll the intro no promises on the news though
[724.62 → 729.26] oops oh right okay there we go yeah
[729.26 → 758.86] MO as moss moss moss organizer dang it jams take the space out moss oh
[758.86 → 763.42] Geiger all right all right all right all right I don't want jams to be upset
[763.42 → 769.84] so we will do one tech news topic today the one that upsets me the most the one that upsets
[769.84 → 776.30] not just you both of us the most oh crap that well that's my document I mean I guess i kind of
[776.30 → 783.50] spoiled it without actually going to the bizjournals.com IBO is dead no, no anyone but IBO
[783.50 → 791.42] no not IBO he was an innocent he was pure of mine I don't know how pure he was with all that
[791.42 → 802.14] all that twerking that was going on not jib ooh this was jib ooh rest in peace IBO okay I know that
[802.14 → 808.14] half of you are going to get Ben from the chat for but can we all please just press f
[808.14 → 817.82] press f to pay respects to IBO please poor IBO and this is about what it looks like to me
[817.82 → 821.18] stop the crying voice whenever other YouTubers do apology videos
[824.78 → 829.98] they're so bad they're so fake anyway yeah so IBO is a company doesn't exist anymore this is why i never
[829.98 → 836.54] apologize for anything because I know you guys are too smart for that kind of crap actually I apologize
[836.54 → 842.62] you should apologize for pandering uh who do I pander to okay so no I'm serious no, no no we'll
[842.62 → 848.30] do the news later just now who do I pander to when you just said you guys are too smart well they are
[849.10 → 854.46] i I think our audience is genuine okay tell you what I have an I have an exercise for you
[856.54 → 865.42] set aside 20 minutes okay spend 10 minutes clicking on random LTT videos and reading like the top 10
[865.42 → 873.98] comments and just kind of going through then log out of YouTube and like fire up a VPN or something
[873.98 → 879.50] so that doesn't know who you are and just start clicking on like top videos on YouTube and reading
[879.50 → 884.30] the top 10 comments on each of them come back and tell me our audience isn't a little smarter okay you're
[884.30 → 892.30] right this is subject this is objective okay this is not pandering this is just actual fact uh anyway
[892.30 → 897.82] tell me about tell me about IBO what happened to jib ooh man okay well let's just go
[897.82 → 902.38] through the points here uh just a year after IBO landed on the cover of time magazine
[903.66 → 908.30] let that sink in that was a lot this is a whole other rant whole other problem like time
[909.02 → 916.94] officially is a rag they made a listicle of their like 10 most innovative tech products
[916.94 → 922.22] they didn't even try it obviously not only did they not try it they didn't even read a review or
[922.22 → 931.18] watch a video because everyone was unanimous it was so bad it was just so useless sorry yeah IBO
[931.18 → 936.22] sucked okay anyway there are parts that were good just a year after IBO landed on the cover of time
[936.22 → 941.82] magazine the company has closed down for good IBO apparently sold its intellectual property assets to
[941.82 → 948.86] New York based son venture partners who apparently are like the vultures of the venture world and um
[949.58 → 955.02] evidence of IBO's decline has been accumulating for months including a round of layoffs in June
[955.90 → 961.10] an empty office space in July these are this are these are evidence these are flags
[961.10 → 967.02] these are flags these are red flags the blog hasn't been updated since May there's no longer an option to
[967.02 → 972.14] buy IBO on the website, although the website is still operational okay is it really okay I'm gonna
[972.14 → 980.70] fire that up now go ahead carry on founded in 2012 uh I believe by a way a MIT professor who studied uh
[981.34 → 986.62] social robotics yeah something to do with like robotic movement her last name was like similar to the
[986.62 → 991.98] word Brazil anyway founded in 2012 the company was right uh the company raised more than 3.5 million
[991.98 → 998.62] dollars during a 2014 Indiegogo campaign didn't you I backed it you backed it I have the shirt you know
[998.62 → 1002.62] what hold on a second go get that shirt I'm going to go get that shirt all right he's gone
[1004.30 → 1008.06] and it went on to collect about 70 million dollars in institutional venture capital
[1008.78 → 1015.66] who invests in this kind of thing you literally you did well I don't think no i mean the venture
[1015.66 → 1021.26] okay I mean the venture capitalists are they that like does they just have nothing better to spend money
[1021.26 → 1026.30] I'm going to go get the shirt after that it was 2012. Do you know what we could do with 70 million dollars
[1026.30 → 1029.66] nobody has ever offered us 70 million dollars you can't even pass calculus
[1031.82 → 1037.42] but we could hire people we have more revenue than IBO boom i actually don't know that they
[1037.42 → 1042.30] actually seem to have sold a fair number of these stupid things so, and they're like 700 of these okay i
[1042.30 → 1048.22] don't actually know that they're more than that uh it was 2012 though so it's a little different because
[1048.22 → 1055.26] anyone can see today that was even less realistic you backed he's yelling saying like who backed it
[1055.26 → 1063.10] it was unrealistic, but he backed it so obviously no one can hear you silence but the thing that you
[1063.10 → 1070.46] didn't know in 2012 was that there was going to be inexpensive fairly intelligent virtual assistants
[1070.46 → 1077.18] in every home like yes we did Siri already existed Linus is saying that Siri already existed true
[1078.54 → 1087.02] true you we thought apple was stop no one can hear you stop yelling at me, I can't, I can't find that
[1087.02 → 1092.94] I'm not yelling at you, I'm yelling I'm yelling to you, you're yelling okay endlessly so here's so here's
[1092.94 → 1100.54] the thing we didn't we didn't know that like Amazon was gonna win or anything like that but we
[1100.54 → 1108.06] knew that inexpensive digital assistants were coming because they already existed Siri already existed
[1108.06 → 1116.94] what were the odds that this weird robot that doesn't move like the demos made no sense like oh
[1116.94 → 1124.70] IBO will take a picture for you right I'm going to go get this thing plug it in and position it why don't
[1124.70 → 1133.26] I just go get a camera at that point why there's just no reason for anything that it was in
[1133.26 → 1139.90] it just made no sense I backed IBO because I knew that if it was ever delivered it was going to be
[1139.90 → 1146.38] a dumpster fire and I wanted to be the first one in on the action that's why I would say I would say you
[1146.38 → 1152.38] burnt your eyebrows right off um the thing that that sucked about IBO in the end though was that
[1152.38 → 1159.66] thing by the yeah I think there's a crux of it by the time it arrived it did have I think fantastic
[1160.38 → 1164.86] uh what do you call the animatronics the way that it moves the way that it dances was super life like
[1164.86 → 1169.34] it was like looking at a Pixar character in front of you it's super awesome that's true and the way they
[1169.34 → 1175.02] did that with just the three four sections four segments of the body really it was really elegant and
[1175.02 → 1180.94] the thing that sucked was the onboard computation the AI the yeah and by the time
[1180.94 → 1187.42] it arrived in 2017 that had been figured out by google and Amazon and maybe even Siri and a lesser
[1187.42 → 1194.86] degree apple if they had just plugged in like if it was just IBO operated by the Google Assistant yes
[1194.86 → 1199.74] it would be way better it still wouldn't have been enough at that price point it still would have had
[1199.74 → 1205.18] to have been three or four hundred dollars it would have had to be a decent music speaker at 399
[1205.82 → 1212.22] with like oh man what else would it have had to do an OLED screen yeah because that really ruined it
[1212.22 → 1217.10] if you look at this can you put up that under the screen all the pictures that you see are like
[1217.10 → 1222.46] that where it's like wow it's this pure black screen with just an eyeball that moves around it has all
[1222.46 → 1227.58] this emotion but when you actually had it in front of you could see the LCD screen it was an it was like
[1227.58 → 1234.14] light gray instead of a black against the background, and it made people thought that it was a big uh
[1234.14 → 1238.78] they thought that it looked like a big mouth they thought the square screen looked like a mouth and
[1238.78 → 1244.38] that its eyes were like yeah there the time picture you can see it so you can see those
[1244.38 → 1249.66] circles at the top those are the cameras and people thought that those looked like eyes and that the
[1249.66 → 1253.02] big square was a giant mouth, and it looked like that big I'm a charge my laser
[1253.02 → 1259.74] so OLED screen necessary we actually talked to them about that at CES, and they said that they
[1259.74 → 1265.18] just couldn't buy the OLED screens um because they couldn't meet the minimum order quantities
[1265.18 → 1269.18] they had to buy such a volume of them, and they weren't making enough GMOs to justify it
[1269.98 → 1274.62] well it's a good thing they didn't uh push for that that minimum order quantity because they would
[1274.62 → 1279.50] have had a lot more GMOs that they wouldn't know what to do with at that point i uh
[1279.50 → 1285.34] I tell you man the amount of venture capital money that just gets thrown at stuff that
[1285.34 → 1291.98] obviously isn't going to work yeah is just mind-blowing to me because that money
[1292.62 → 1300.46] is just gone it's just gone it's not just gone it is just no, no no, no no a lot of it a lot of it
[1300.46 → 1305.18] was paid to the employees okay they worked on it since 2012 yeah yeah those people put it back into the
[1305.18 → 1311.18] economy all right okay it's not gone but like if you wanted to just contribute to putting
[1311.18 → 1317.66] money back in the economy why don't you just like donate to a homeless shelter or two like obviously
[1317.66 → 1326.30] there are better ways to just put money back into the economy than creating a weird plastic AI
[1326.94 → 1334.62] like landfill filler like well that is sad that imagine just making a mass market product
[1334.62 → 1339.42] and all the environmental damage part of that, and then they're just in a heap like getting
[1339.42 → 1345.90] liquidated nobody cares yeah that's ET for Atari or whatever just like literally bury them yeah that's
[1345.90 → 1351.02] brutal one thing that I feel really weird about with this one is that I've never before felt such a
[1351.02 → 1358.62] visceral connection to free market capitalism like this thing failed for lots of good reasons but in a way
[1359.50 → 1365.82] we definitely played a role in it failing because well they made it they made it suck it arrived at
[1365.82 → 1370.14] our desk we told the whole world that it sucked we weren't the only ones who said it, but we're a very
[1370.14 → 1375.98] visible channel and so in our own small way we contributed to these people not having jobs anymore
[1375.98 → 1381.90] and that's kind of crazy I feel like part of me feels bad but then I'm just like well I'm just like cog in
[1381.90 → 1387.90] the wheel of evolution and free market capitalism sink or swim you guys should have done a better job
[1387.90 → 1394.22] and I wouldn't have had to do this to you that's an interesting uh that's an interesting take on it
[1394.22 → 1404.06] you know it's funny I don't normally think of myself as having an um this is weird like playing a role yeah as
[1404.06 → 1409.50] as sort of playing a role and people not having a job anymore but uh that is an interesting take on it, i just
[1409.50 → 1416.46] I guess i maybe I should feel bad because I'm sure there were very smart people very intelligent
[1416.46 → 1424.30] people who worked at IBO no question but like I look at it and I go this was so obvious
[1424.30 → 1432.46] to me that this wasn't going anywhere um like why didn't you get out like I feel bad because yes I guess
[1432.46 → 1437.18] we contributed to the downfall though to be clear in this case I don't feel that bad because I don't
[1437.18 → 1444.38] think we played that large of a role but like couldn't you tell you know well I mean a lot for
[1444.38 → 1448.46] a lot of people it's just the job like they know it's not going to be an awesome product, but they're
[1448.46 → 1454.94] getting they're fleshing out their resume right but here's the thing like I quit my job when it was
[1454.94 → 1462.14] clear to me that the direction of the trajectory of the company was not competitive and
[1462.14 → 1469.90] the thing is that it's easy a lot of the time people say well it's easy for you to say you know
[1469.90 → 1478.78] you had an opportunity to go and do something else, and it's like right but if the trajectory is bad and
[1478.78 → 1487.74] the foundational aspects of the business are bad which it should have been obvious to anybody who
[1487.74 → 1495.34] worked there, but this company was not profitable and not hitting key milestones, so investor money was
[1495.34 → 1502.06] going to run out what do you think is going to happen so when you can see that the foundation is rotten
[1502.78 → 1511.34] and the trajectory is bad why not go now well maybe because rather than later when everyone all your
[1511.34 → 1515.26] other colleagues are trying to find work too well because the part that you're working on might be good
[1515.26 → 1520.86] like the person who did the animatronics his resume is his or her resume is still awesome at the end of
[1520.86 → 1525.02] it they'll probably find a job there's and there are lots of things like I made all the APIs that connected
[1525.02 → 1530.14] to heart radio or whatever like when you compartmentalize that they maybe still are proud of the work
[1530.14 → 1534.86] but here's the thing like you had a pretty long runway here you could kind of wrap up your current
[1534.86 → 1541.02] project get the resumes out there you know like well it's a startup so maybe they had vested chairs like
[1541.02 → 1544.70] a lot of their pay structure could have been staying there okay yeah that could be true
[1545.98 → 1550.54] say okay that's something I didn't really consider like when I think about employee retention you know
[1550.54 → 1557.10] I really think about making sure that I maintain and making sure that everybody who works here knows
[1557.10 → 1565.50] that we are maintaining very strong like foundational strength for the business like Linus media group is
[1565.50 → 1572.78] built upon rock not upon wood that is eaten what kind of rock carpenter limestone tall and if it's
[1572.78 → 1578.06] talk its granite that's number one on the most hardness scale it's granite you know
[1578.06 → 1583.42] the hardness scale yes I know most scale of hardness what's 10 then I don't is it diamond yeah
[1584.38 → 1587.74] what what what's the only thing I can cut a diamond though more diamond yeah
[1587.74 → 1595.98] yeah ow headphone users yeah grade three facts I don't even think that's grade three facts it's
[1595.98 → 1599.58] more like grade nine facts most hardness scale is grade eight but like the whole like what can
[1599.58 → 1604.30] cut a diamond that's young that's kid stuff okay all right all right all right all right
[1604.94 → 1611.74] anyway i just I feel bad but I also feel bad in the same way that like I feel bad for some of my
[1611.74 → 1615.34] colleagues who were left over at NCI like I feel bad this sucks but like
[1617.58 → 1622.78] some of them and this is the funniest thing about it sort of some of them I had conversations
[1622.78 → 1632.86] with like hey it's been another year you're still there what gives I'm like yeah you know it's good for
[1632.86 → 1640.22] me I'm like right but like this clearly isn't sustainable why are you still there
[1640.22 → 1646.86] yeah you know like it's I'd rather I'd rather be the rat that abandoned the ship
[1647.58 → 1651.58] than like the one that goes down with it personally and I think it sounded more like
[1651.58 → 1654.94] you were the rat that was like I'm going to get into this container and get shipped off of the
[1654.94 → 1659.26] ship before it hits an iceberg and then all the other people still work they're like the rats
[1659.26 → 1663.74] scurrying away from the water in titanic you know when they're trapped at the bottom and
[1664.70 → 1670.14] those cages the Irish people I am proud to say I have not watched that movie since it's theatrical
[1670.14 → 1676.30] release I do not remember hmm, and you would have been wait 11 years old yeah
[1677.50 → 1683.34] what 94 was it 94 no it's 96? I was in the third grade I believe
[1685.18 → 1692.78] this is an important like event in your life like you remember titanic 97. 97 okay I'm guessing
[1692.78 → 1698.86] yeah, yeah so I would have been 11 in 97 yeah 1997 okay all right I'm pretty good at that it's one of my
[1698.86 → 1705.82] like pet superpowers okay guessing dates uh years that I've lived through of things you got a good one
[1705.82 → 1716.54] for me here um no it's just bad superpower it's rarely useful and even when it's useful all I get is
[1716.54 → 1722.38] little brownie points for myself date guessing man exactly he's no fun at parties
[1725.26 → 1733.34] what year was 9 11 2001 okay so that's easy I know because that was like wait I'm so stupid I tried
[1733.34 → 1737.42] that was supposed to be a joke where the answer was built into the question no but none of those two
[1737.42 → 1743.34] numbers even have to do with the year yeah no that was like that was one of the most surreal moments of
[1743.34 → 1751.98] my life so living on the west coast um like everything that went down was very much in
[1751.98 → 1759.18] progress um when my radio alarm like when you woke up when so my alarm clock was tuned into news
[1759.18 → 1763.74] radio because I found that that woke me up better than music someone like talking at me and the way
[1763.74 → 1768.86] they were talking at me that morning I thought I was still dreaming I was sure I was still dreaming I was
[1768.86 → 1775.34] like this is the weirdest street and holy now you said a swear word I've never said a swear word in my
[1775.34 → 1783.58] life um look in the 2018 yeah so so the so it was like going off next to me and I was just
[1783.58 → 1789.50] like i just kind of lied in bed I was like is this real like
[1791.74 → 1797.90] yeah yeah I'm awake um and like school all that day so like I remember my grade nine science
[1797.90 → 1804.38] teacher was just he didn't really even say they wheel the TV into your classroom um yeah he
[1804.38 → 1809.82] didn't because the science class always had their own TV right so he uh so he didn't really say we
[1809.82 → 1817.66] weren't going to do class that day, but he had the TV on and loud so that like he could hear and
[1819.02 → 1824.70] like we didn't have class that day yeah yeah it was it was bizarre anyway um we could do we
[1824.70 → 1829.18] could do another there's no way to nicely uh say we're out of that so let's just do sponsors yeah
[1829.18 → 1839.58] let's do our sponsors so um the first one we've got is um oh wait what the heck uh sorry so you are
[1839.58 → 1850.94] an invidious show uh the first one we've got is uh moss uh yes moss organizer, so this is the moss Grande
[1850.94 → 1854.70] previous generation you can hold that one oh that's exactly what it does and I will take the
[1854.70 → 1863.34] moss Grande 2018 updated version I like the black one, so this pack is expandable up to 40 litres and
[1863.34 → 1869.50] I'm just going to try and find the expandable zipper I'm sure it works similarly to mine but I can't find
[1869.50 → 1877.02] it right now ah it's this one so you can wait yes it's this one so you can expand it like that personally
[1877.02 → 1881.74] I would just don't really use that feature but whatever it's up to you if it's up to 17 inch
[1881.74 → 1888.78] laptops it's a 40 ounce water bottle no you're the type of dude that always has a full backpack
[1888.78 → 1896.54] not anymore wow when i was riding my bike uh this summer to work I was just got so sick of
[1896.54 → 1901.10] carrying so much stuff on my back because it's really uncomfortable in a sport bike posture to carry
[1901.10 → 1907.90] a heavy backpack that I was like you know what I work hard I'm going to treat myself to a second one
[1907.90 → 1913.26] of all the stupid tools that I keep in my backpack one for work and one for home so that's why I bought
[1913.26 → 1919.26] myself this other orange screwdriver I bought myself another pair of side cutters another pair of pliers
[1919.26 → 1923.58] another pair of jeweller screwdrivers like all those stupid things that I always keep in my bag so I'm
[1923.58 → 1928.78] actually down to I don't even think this is the same model is it the same model yeah I think it is the
[1928.78 → 1933.82] same model okay well whatever, so this is my bag so the only things I have in it are my blade my mouse
[1933.82 → 1942.14] pad for my blade stealth um oh these phones that I've been meaning to return to work Tyler uh in
[1942.14 → 1949.18] the tablet that's in the tablet pouch I've got my power bank I've got my sunglasses and the handy dandy um
[1949.18 → 1957.18] um sunglass like yeah the top one that's a sweet pouch yeah oh wow it is armoured yeah I've got my
[1957.18 → 1962.22] mouse is that four sunglasses mouse down the ones yeah that's on the one side I've usually got my
[1962.22 → 1967.82] power ball on the other side but right now I have some aspirin because my knee hurts, and it's inflamed um
[1968.94 → 1975.18] and then I've got my power adapter which is not supposed to be there I've got some there's a zipper here
[1975.18 → 1980.54] sorry you guys aren't really able to see this but I've got some USB some chapstick my uh angel bird
[1980.54 → 1988.70] portable SSD uh some business cards this was uh this was actually a nice like uh best man groomsman
[1988.70 → 1994.54] gift it's like uh got my name on it yeah they got divorced but oh they spelled your name wrong I still
[1994.54 → 2004.94] have no they did not I know for a fact isn't it s e b an s s t i an n Sebastian anyway uh it is
[2004.94 → 2010.62] the new one has improved strap materials for greater comfort a stronger ripstop nylon lining
[2010.62 → 2016.86] improved power adapter mounting and cable management use, and you can use offer code minus tech 25 to save
[2016.86 → 2023.82] 10 over at moss organizer lol didn't have that up the whole time dot com until Christmas
[2025.10 → 2032.54] organization it's truly a great gift for the OCD nerds in your life all right so we've also got
[2032.54 → 2037.82] see sonic as a sponsor today wow since when does see sonic sponsor the land show, and they are featuring
[2038.38 → 2047.10] the um where'd it go it's the power supply that we had over here yeah there'd it go hold on is this
[2047.10 → 2054.62] it oh no sorry that's not uh do you have the power supply I have nothing oh wait a second
[2054.62 → 2063.34] do you have it is this it no that's not it uh okay well I guess I can't really I guess I can't really
[2063.34 → 2071.10] show it um, so the see sonic prime ultra time oh I know what we're supposed to do I'm supposed to click
[2071.10 → 2079.98] this the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the there it is can we use cookies uh yes
[2079.98 → 2086.54] yes, yes use your cookies yes you can have all the cookies the prime ultra titanium it's 80 plus
[2086.54 → 2095.18] titanium, and it has a 12-year warranty which is ridiculous it's fully modular uh it's super quiet
[2095.18 → 2100.94] how many builds would you use over 12 years is that two three pcs that's like three to four for
[2100.94 → 2105.90] me anyway like every three years I'd say it's pretty reasonable to refresh your computer maybe
[2105.90 → 2110.78] not the whole thing well exactly you're keeping the power supply like graphic yeah for sure there
[2110.78 → 2117.26] would be no reason to upgrade this power supply that I can think of for at least like I'm just
[2117.26 → 2122.86] trying to think like 10 years ago what was a top of the line power supply like it would still be
[2122.86 → 2127.10] usable today even if it's not still top of the line like I see no reason why this couldn't be the
[2127.10 → 2133.02] same thing so it's got a fluid dynamic fan uh fluid dynamic bearing fan it's got premium hybrid
[2133.02 → 2137.98] fan control so you can keep your fan noise minimal it's got micro tolerance load regulation whatever
[2137.98 → 2143.10] that means basically it means good regulation and lambda noise level a plus so that means the
[2143.10 → 2150.22] noise output stays below 20 decibels during operation pretty cool so check it out at season website or

[2206.06 → 2213.42] from other sponsors of ours that are like who's that jams guy what is he doing I haven't heard from
[2213.42 → 2218.54] fresh books I don't know they seem pretty chill someone came up to me at Ltd and was like do fresh books
[2219.74 → 2231.58] really yeah all right a Chinese scientist claims to have created the first designer babies um
[2232.46 → 2240.14] basically this was posted by captain to fire on the forum and um it's like
[2240.14 → 2248.22] kind of hard to cover this because the actual information is a little bit spotty so he claims
[2248.22 → 2255.82] that he's created two twin girls that are resistant to HIV virus through some kind of mutation that is
[2255.82 → 2263.66] more common in uh Europe people of European ancestry who are survivors of like the bubonic plague or something
[2263.66 → 2269.02] like that like it has to do with some resistance that was built in Europe, but that wasn't built over in
[2269.02 → 2277.26] Asia um now pretty much everyone is mad uh the university that he was currently on unpaid leave
[2277.26 → 2285.18] from uh the scientific community at large the tech community at large um and like the university was
[2285.98 → 2292.70] unaware of the project and its nature and is calling on international experts to form an independent
[2292.70 → 2299.58] committee to probe the matter like people be mad um is there anything else to kind of say about this
[2299.58 → 2305.02] well we can talk about what actually sure allegedly happened so the best way to get acquainted I thought
[2305.02 → 2310.38] our good starting point is actually looked at a YouTube video that the doctor whose last name is he which is
[2310.38 → 2317.42] actually kind of uh confusing, but he uploaded this video and he um gives his perspective on the whole
[2317.42 → 2323.58] thing he doesn't call them designer babies he thinks that this is totally ethical and moral and I think
[2323.58 → 2329.26] he makes a compelling case for that here um, and he explains the process which is this is
[2329.26 → 2336.46] fertilization by IVF and so what they did was they inject the father's sperm into the mother's eggs and
[2336.46 → 2342.22] shortly after that they inject some proteins, and they carry out the gene surgery uh using CRISPR technology
[2342.94 → 2347.98] which I understand if there are enzymes are programmed to look for particular patterns in DNA and when
[2347.98 → 2353.58] they find them they just snip that out and only that so what they did was they sequenced um
[2354.62 → 2362.14] and they did a whole genome sequencing on the I guess the cells on the babies before doing the
[2362.14 → 2368.30] genome surgery and after and the reason they did that is then they can compare to see if any genes were
[2368.30 → 2374.46] affected that weren't intended to be affected and uh according to this person's the doctor's statement
[2374.46 → 2379.34] um the scientist does say that they didn't they didn't alter anything that they didn't intend to
[2379.34 → 2381.18] alter so it was a success in that regard
[2383.66 → 2389.10] so if it's all true that um these children are alive now they've been born, and they will be the
[2389.10 → 2392.70] the first living people who have had their genes edited if it's true
[2395.50 → 2401.66] dang crazy so it's going to be an interesting uh it's going to be an interesting couple of decades
[2401.66 → 2407.42] where do you use I see you scrolling over to other topics but where do you sit on that I'm like oh wow
[2407.42 → 2414.38] that is a pretty big question isn't it um I think it's I am far more comfortable with cybernetic
[2414.38 → 2420.30] improvements to humans than I am with genetic improvements to humans I think we open ourselves
[2420.30 → 2426.62] up to a lot of potential uh problems I mean even this one already has problems like I believe west
[2426.62 → 2434.38] Nile virus is uh more likely to infect these little girls' oh that's hairy so you're you're gaining
[2434.38 → 2439.82] resistance to one disease, but you're actually losing some of your resistance to another and of course
[2439.82 → 2445.58] they're not consenting to that and of course they are not consenting to that that's that's a whole
[2445.58 → 2450.94] that's a whole separate issue I'm sort of talking 10 000 foot view right now what does it mean to
[2450.94 → 2458.46] humanity now as long as it takes place on a relatively limited scale i i I doubt that we're
[2458.46 → 2464.14] opening ourselves up to mass extinction through having you know edited all of our own genes like of an
[2464.14 → 2469.18] entire if we edited an entire generation's genes and then all of a sudden something came along we made
[2469.18 → 2475.34] ourselves weak against it and riff humanity is dead um like i I feel like that kind of thing is very
[2475.34 → 2485.26] very unlikely um most of my discomfort like so right so in small doses I actually don't see it necessarily
[2485.26 → 2492.06] being a huge problem the issue is that yeah I broke it already the issue is that it opens itself up to
[2492.06 → 2499.02] all kinds of misuse and I don't have a ton of inherent trust for people okay there is nothing that I have
[2499.02 → 2506.22] seen in my life that would lead me to believe that people as a whole will take some kind of technology
[2506.22 → 2514.86] and use it only or even primarily for good are you if you take a step back and let's say everything was
[2514.86 → 2521.82] executed perfectly, and maybe we're not even considering the fact that the alterations are inheritable by that
[2521.82 → 2530.06] by that organism's next of kin um if you just answer the question is it okay to remove conditions
[2530.06 → 2537.26] that are just objectively harmful to someone like take away the muddying of the fact
[2537.26 → 2541.02] that this may have increased their likelihood to contract a different disease so I have to ignore
[2541.02 → 2548.62] that we might not know what the hell we're doing yeah like let's just say in a vacuum it's like uh
[2549.26 → 2554.30] this procedure is guaranteed to only remove something harmful I guess your slippery slope
[2554.30 → 2559.58] arguments still remain it sure does that's the thing about a slippery slope is it starts really
[2559.58 → 2563.58] high up, and you actually don't know that it was a problem until you're faced down in the mud at the bottom
[2563.58 → 2571.90] so um yeah right so like I said I am far more comfortable with cybernetic upgrades than I am with
[2571.90 → 2577.90] actually making changes at a genetic level but does that apply even if those cybernetic upgrades are
[2577.90 → 2584.62] happening to an infant like the baby's born, and you put an implant we already have that it's called a cochlear
[2584.62 → 2592.54] implant you can use it to restore hearing to an infant that was born profoundly deaf so we have that um
[2592.54 → 2601.50] um now the funny thing about that is you might think as a hearing person as someone who was who
[2601.50 → 2607.98] was born without what at least some people would describe as a disability you might think well this
[2607.98 → 2615.02] is so obvious if they couldn't hear, and now they can hear then that's great cochlear implants for all
[2615.02 → 2620.30] but there are actually people out there who feel like they've kind of had their identity robbed from
[2620.30 → 2626.14] them because a cochlear implant does not make you hear as well as a hearing person in the installation
[2626.14 → 2630.94] of a cochlear implant they have to remove and this might be outdated knowledge but as far as I know
[2630.94 → 2639.34] they have to remove everything that was left of any uh hearing capability that you had before they
[2639.34 → 2645.98] perform the operation making you sort of not whole as a person depending on how you kind of define
[2645.98 → 2652.38] that, and so they can end up feeling kind of robbed of a community because if they hadn't had it they
[2652.38 → 2657.66] would have been part of the deaf community versus if they just hadn't been born deaf then they would
[2657.66 → 2663.50] have been part of the hearing community, but they're kind of in this weird limbo, and you could make
[2663.50 → 2669.50] objective arguments all day for why their position is wrong, but it doesn't ultimately matter because if we
[2669.50 → 2678.70] remove the emotional component of being human then why even bother wow I have a perfect emotional segue
[2678.70 → 2683.50] for that we've got a hundred dollar super chat over here we should read out oh really wow who does that
[2684.14 → 2692.30] uh thank you uh in advance um hey thanks for the during my job I hope you remember me
[2692.30 → 2698.70] shoe 125 probably not lol still never got float plane working ah thanks for the during my
[2698.70 → 2705.82] is this a person from the CX for during my job I don't know or someone just watches LTT at work
[2705.82 → 2714.54] I don't know um Jules asked how was the cake I actually didn't get any I did how was the cake very
[2714.54 → 2721.34] tall it was like how wide do I have to make this piece to get a regular like amount of cake here and
[2721.34 → 2726.22] I was like I'm just going to go regular width, and its like was it yummy it was like an almond style cake
[2726.22 → 2731.18] right or something isn't that marzipan I don't know was it good yeah there's lots of custard in
[2731.18 → 2735.82] it which I'm all about lots of many layers it was like I had this tiger wait did I take a photo of
[2735.82 → 2742.30] this whatever it was good thanks for the cake uh make says make a computer that is made from chip to
[2742.30 → 2748.14] chip transistor and resistors from scratch that equals something from 1995. I think Alex is actually working
[2748.14 → 2753.82] on a DIY CPU at the moment um by the way hi Scott no it's like there's like a guide you can follow
[2753.82 → 2758.70] like he doesn't have to invent it or anything um so yeah we have rick from rick and Morty working in
[2758.70 → 2765.10] oh yeah he's just over there making a flux capacitor defibrillator wait what space time
[2765.74 → 2770.06] space time defibrillator when you're time travelling and someone's under cardiac arrest
[2770.06 → 2777.42] all right one more topic the most important one of this week that's what you're picking
[2778.30 → 2784.94] starbucks says it's going to block porn on its public Wi-Fi next year so if you want it
[2784.94 → 2790.54] if you want to jerk it in Starbucks you're going to have to do it sometime between now and December 31st
[2790.54 → 2794.86] hey you don't have to I vote for Christmas day because it'll probably be pretty empty
[2794.86 → 2801.90] um yeah there's not really much else to say about that there's a little bit actually, so there was
[2802.46 → 2805.90] they're late to the party there's some people who are actually kind of mad because Starbucks took
[2806.78 → 2810.22] up to two years longer than other chains like subway and Chick-fil-A and McDonald's who have
[2810.22 → 2816.78] already implemented this and there's actually an um a petition that circulated that got 26 000 signatures
[2817.82 → 2823.02] um that was circulated by an organization who fights with these this kind of stuff and they
[2823.02 → 2826.94] have some pretty compelling arguments of why this should happen sooner so they say that it helps
[2827.82 → 2834.06] teens and underage people um like when they don't have these filters at Starbucks these kids
[2834.06 → 2838.78] can go to these public Wi-Fi places and watch stuff that they otherwise couldn't watch at home under
[2839.90 → 2846.86] home Wi-Fi and that also applies to sex offenders who by law can't visit certain sites right but
[2846.86 → 2854.22] apparently they can when they go to these public spaces, so actually there is one more topic YouTube
[2854.22 → 2861.42] is bringing down the paywall on their YouTube originals apparently um they have determined that
[2861.42 → 2867.18] the ad supported model that has sustained YouTube basically since its uh acquisition from by Google anyway
[2867.98 → 2874.30] is the way to go so YouTube originals are still getting funded, but they will become free and ad
[2874.30 → 2878.94] supported rather than only being available to YouTube premium members personally I think this is a good
[2878.94 → 2885.18] move um I mean for my part anyway YouTube premium is already a compelling enough value ad
[2885.98 → 2891.34] or a compelling enough value just based on that I don't have to watch ads like and I don't even watch
[2891.34 → 2896.78] much YouTube like half the time I'm blocking the ad on my own video with my premium stupid premium
[2896.78 → 2901.66] membership uh the fact that like YouTube our Google play music is included like it's already a great value i
[2901.66 → 2908.78] I don't really understand why we need these originals uh like original series um but what this will
[2908.78 → 2913.82] probably mean is that YouTube is going to be cutting back the kind of funding that they had put aside for
[2913.82 → 2917.90] YouTube originals like it seems to me that they've just done some re-kid jiggering of the map on the
[2917.90 → 2924.54] back end for how this YouTube premium money is getting distributed, and they've gone well we're spending a lot
[2924.54 → 2928.30] on these originals, but they don't seem to be actually driving subscriptions so what if we just kind of
[2928.30 → 2933.66] cut that entire part of the equation and like we can still do YouTube originals and that's like cool
[2933.66 → 2937.42] but let's just make it accessible to everyone and then maybe it'll get a lot more views and then
[2937.42 → 2941.18] like maybe people will care more about it, and we can go like mainstream with this whole thing and then
[2941.18 → 2945.98] there's like merch and licensing and like other platforms that we can license it to and like they
[2945.98 → 2951.90] could take a more conventional approach to uh to high production value content and that's that's right
[2951.90 → 2956.62] because even though it was a ton of money hundreds of millions of dollars that's still a drop in the
[2956.62 → 2962.62] bucket compared to the tens of billions that other services like Netflix and Amazon Prime and Hulu are
[2962.62 → 2969.10] spending so and no offence to ourselves and other YouTubers but like quite frankly i would pick
[2969.74 → 2977.18] you know the actual experienced Hollywood production people that Netflix works with over like YouTubers
[2977.18 → 2983.18] for these kinds of well the thing is you lose the spirit of what you like about the YouTuber like I love
[2983.18 → 2988.86] sauce I didn't Michael if you're watching I didn't really care for the mind frame that I watched and
[2988.86 → 2994.22] the reason even though the concepts are cool is that it's no longer sauce because the cool thing
[2994.22 → 2999.66] you like about sauce is Michael's cool entrance and like it's just one camera, and he sets it up in a
[2999.66 → 3003.58] weird location in his house in a weird way and then suddenly I just feel like I'm watching discovery
[3003.58 → 3008.54] channel or something with these epic sweeps all booms, and it's like it doesn't have the same character
[3008.54 → 3015.02] yeah, yeah, so this is gonna start uh it's actually starting in 2019, but it won't fully affect all
[3015.02 → 3020.06] originals until 2020. There's probably some contract stuff going on there so some of the originals will
[3020.06 → 3025.18] be free to watch with ads soon and others you'll have to wait a little while speaking of things that
[3025.18 → 3031.42] you'll have to wait a little while for the wan show you're you're fixed next week because we are
[3031.42 → 3037.98] done for the day it's uh wow it is 20 after 6 we are super done for the day we will see you again next
[3037.98 → 3040.46] week same bat time same bat channel bye
[3046.70 → 3048.78] one chat's like hey it's sauce Michael here
[3050.14 → 3052.86] I would, I did get to meet some of his support
[3052.86 → 3053.26] stuff
[3053.26 → 3055.34] oh that's I was honest
[3057.66 → 3059.50] were they like oh wow that's so cool
[3059.50 → 3060.30] you look for my head
[3061.74 → 3065.26] nope they were like who is a no I don't even know if they have anything
[3065.26 → 3072.06] you like
[3072.06 → 3074.06] you
[3074.06 → 3076.06] you
